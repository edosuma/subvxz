00:12.933 --> 00:16.200
Bill Buchanan had Fayed
in custody...

00:16.267 --> 00:18.900
and he let him go.

00:18.967 --> 00:23.367
Karen Hayes put it
in a blue file over at Homeland.

00:23.434 --> 00:25.234
Someone is going to have
to go down--

00:25.301 --> 00:27.167
the farther from the
president, the better.

00:27.234 --> 00:28.701
Are you asking me to resign?

00:28.768 --> 00:29.701
HAYES:
No, Bill.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.234
I have to fire you.

00:31.301 --> 00:33.234
We're talking about
the end of my career.

00:33.301 --> 00:36.401
An FB sub-circuit board
from one of the weapons

00:36.467 --> 00:38.601
is now in the possession
of an agent

00:38.668 --> 00:40.567
of the Chinese government.

00:40.634 --> 00:41.867
If the Chinese agent

00:41.933 --> 00:44.100
in possession
of the sub-circuit board

00:44.167 --> 00:46.734
is allowed to transfer it
to his government,

00:46.800 --> 00:50.867
the entire Russian defense
system will be compromised.

00:50.933 --> 00:52.701
I will have no choice
but to extend

00:52.768 --> 00:55.134
my country's
forward perimeter.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.100
You are talking about attacking
one of our military bases.

00:58.167 --> 01:00.301
You have two hours.

01:01.634 --> 01:03.134
Everyone on the floor!

01:03.200 --> 01:04.668
CHENG:
My men have your grandson.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.933
Have you finished repairing
the sub-circuit board?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.100
I'll return it when you bring me
my grandson.

01:09.167 --> 01:11.367
Cheng, I'm sending the boy
to you now.

01:14.567 --> 01:15.634
Hello, Josh.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.467
Your grandfather
wants to speak with you.

01:17.534 --> 01:19.134
What do you want from me?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.501
I am going to give you
the future I promised you

01:21.567 --> 01:22.933
when you were born.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.401
I'm taking you away
from this ungrateful country.

01:33.534 --> 01:36.034
Cheng, it's over!

01:36.100 --> 01:38.534
Tell me where the boy is
and I won't kill you.

01:39.234 --> 01:40.367
Help!

01:40.434 --> 01:41.867
Josh!

01:41.933 --> 01:42.867
Dad...

01:42.933 --> 01:45.467
(grunting)

01:47.034 --> 01:48.401
I lost the boy.

01:48.467 --> 01:49.501
PHILLIP:
Who has him?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.200
CTU and your son.

01:51.267 --> 01:53.267
This is totally unacceptable.

01:53.334 --> 01:56.833
The boy was my price
for repairing the circuit board.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.301
Our arrangement is over.

01:58.367 --> 01:59.967
Got Phillip Bauer calling

02:00.034 --> 02:01.501
for you on
a scrambled line.

02:01.567 --> 02:02.967
I want my grandson.

02:03.034 --> 02:06.000
And I want clear passage
to the country of my choice.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.334
You give me that

02:07.401 --> 02:10.167
and I'll give you
the FB sub-circuit board.

02:10.234 --> 02:12.200
You're working with the Chinese.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.200
I was.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.467
You think Phillip Bauer

02:14.534 --> 02:16.067
is somebody
that we can trust?

02:16.134 --> 02:17.401
We have no choice.

02:17.467 --> 02:18.668
Get me CTU.

02:18.734 --> 02:20.833
Josh, you need to come
with me.

02:20.900 --> 02:21.833
What do you mean?!

02:21.900 --> 02:22.867
Come now!

02:22.933 --> 02:23.933
Agent Doyle!

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Orders, Jack!

02:25.067 --> 02:26.634
The boy stays with me!

02:26.701 --> 02:28.668
What are you doing?!

02:28.734 --> 02:29.933
Josh!

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.800 --> 03:00.867
Where are you taking me?

03:00.933 --> 03:02.134
I thought we were going back
to CTU.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.067
I'm sorry, Josh.

03:04.134 --> 03:08.567
You're sorry for what?
What's going on?

03:08.634 --> 03:11.134
This has to do
with my grandpa.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.367
Josh, he's got something
we need.

03:14.434 --> 03:16.334
Something that
will stop a war.

03:16.401 --> 03:17.967
So we have to go through
the motions

03:18.034 --> 03:19.467
of handing you
over to him.

03:19.534 --> 03:23.134
What, meaning you're not
actually going to do it?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.467
Meaning as soon as we
get what we need from him,

03:25.534 --> 03:26.900
we're gonna recover you.

03:26.967 --> 03:30.668
We have two Tac teams
and LAPD at the rendezvous site.

03:33.768 --> 03:35.734
This is a locating device, Josh.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.701
So we're going
to be able to track you

03:37.768 --> 03:38.967
until we get
the green light

03:39.034 --> 03:41.367
on your recovery
operation.

03:41.434 --> 03:44.800
Look, I understand
you're scared.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.434
I would be, too.

03:46.501 --> 03:49.134
But I will get you
back, Josh.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.634
This may sting
a little.

03:55.701 --> 03:58.167
Ow!

04:11.401 --> 04:14.200
Ryan, we are making
a mistake.

04:14.267 --> 04:15.768
You can't let
them do this.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.267
You can talk
to Doyle.

04:17.334 --> 04:19.034
You can't let
them hand Josh
over to my father.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.466
Those orders come
from the White House.

04:20.534 --> 04:21.733
Get in the car.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.167
Are you arresting me?

04:23.234 --> 04:24.434
Are you charging me
with something?
No, Jack,

04:24.501 --> 04:26.034
we have orders to place you
in temporary

04:26.100 --> 04:28.000
custody in order to
protect our operation.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.567
Don't make this harder
than it is.

04:29.634 --> 04:31.234
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:43.234 --> 04:45.668
(sighs)
(phone rings)

04:45.734 --> 04:47.734
O'Brian.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.867
Chloe, it's Jack.

04:48.933 --> 04:51.034
Jack, Nadia said
you were in custody.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.267
Why the hell is CTU handing
Josh over to my father?

04:53.334 --> 04:55.601
It's a tradeoff.
The order came in
from the Vice President.

04:55.668 --> 04:58.867
Your father got
ahold of the FB
sub-circuit board.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.833
He's offering it
in exchange for Josh

05:00.900 --> 05:02.668
and a safe passage
out of the country.

05:02.734 --> 05:04.933
Whatever my father said,
he has no intention

05:05.000 --> 05:06.367
of giving up
that circuit board.

05:06.434 --> 05:08.334
The White House feels
they have no alternative.

05:08.401 --> 05:11.000
Apparently, Doyle
has a plan to get Josh back.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.833
My father will have
a better plan.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.301
Damn it, Chloe,
we need to stop this.

05:15.367 --> 05:17.067
Put me through to Karen Hayes.

05:17.134 --> 05:19.100
Hold on.

05:19.167 --> 05:23.200
My earlier deception
was a desperate move

05:23.267 --> 05:24.734
on my part,
Mr. President.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.634
It was a mistake

05:26.701 --> 05:30.933
which I'm sure compromised
your trust in me,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.534
and for that I'm deeply sorry.

05:32.601 --> 05:36.134
But you are not calling
simply to offer your apology.

05:36.200 --> 05:40.034
Sir, I'm aware that your
generals are pushing you toward

05:40.100 --> 05:45.234
a military response, but an
opportunity has presented itself

05:45.301 --> 05:47.634
that may allow us both
to avoid a war

05:47.701 --> 05:49.367
that neither of us wants.

05:49.434 --> 05:50.800
I am listening.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.701
The man who has the component
is no longer working

05:52.768 --> 05:53.833
with the Chinese.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.768
He's offered to trade it
back to us,

05:56.833 --> 05:59.334
and I've authorized
the exchange.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.768
For the sake of both our
countries, Mr. Vice President,

06:01.833 --> 06:03.401
I hope it happens soon,

06:03.467 --> 06:05.401
because until you have
the component,

06:05.467 --> 06:08.800
I have no choice but to continue
on our present path.

06:08.867 --> 06:11.434
(phone rings)
The chatter
we are picking up

06:11.501 --> 06:12.501
from Chinese military
intelligence

06:12.567 --> 06:13.933
is not encouraging,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.034
and you and I both know
they are far from incompetent.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.900
I cannot extend or rescind
this deadline

06:18.967 --> 06:22.167
for anything other
than concrete results.

06:22.234 --> 06:24.234
I understand your position,
Mr. President.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.200
The purpose of this call
is just to keep you current

06:27.267 --> 06:30.167
on our efforts to try
to avoid a conflict.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.501
Karen Hayes.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.933
JACK:
This is Bauer.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.234
Do you know of the Vice
President's plan

06:35.301 --> 06:36.867
to hand my nephew over
to my father?

06:36.933 --> 06:38.034
I do.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.701
Karen, you cannot let
this happen.

06:39.768 --> 06:41.334
It is a mistake
to trust my father.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.634
You will get
nothing back.

06:42.701 --> 06:45.134
He's gonna keep Josh
and the circuit board.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.867
But why would he need
the circuit board?

06:46.933 --> 06:48.067
Because it's his
only leverage

06:48.134 --> 06:49.067
with the Chinese.

06:49.134 --> 06:50.701
He's useless
to them without it.

06:50.768 --> 06:53.534
Whatever you're offering him,
the Chinese are offering more.

06:53.601 --> 06:57.267
Karen, my father is smart enough
to manipulate this exchange.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.134
Look, Jack, I don't think

07:00.200 --> 07:01.701
we should go through
with this either,

07:01.768 --> 07:04.668
but the Vice President feels
it's the only way to avoid war.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.467
He's given his order

07:06.534 --> 07:08.567
and I don't have
the authority to
do anything.

07:08.634 --> 07:10.401
You're gonna have
to take care of this

07:10.467 --> 07:11.734
from your end.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.034
I can't. CTU has put me
in temporary custody

07:14.100 --> 07:16.701
to stop me from interfering
with their operation.

07:16.768 --> 07:20.933
Karen, he is
an innocent boy.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.933
You need to stop this,
and you need to stop it now.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.668
Well, that did not go well.

07:35.734 --> 07:38.367
Not that I expected much
good will from Suvarov.

07:38.434 --> 07:40.900
I just got off
the phone with Jack Bauer.

07:40.967 --> 07:42.734
I thought he was
under arrest.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.401
He is, but he called me.

07:44.467 --> 07:46.301
Okay, he called you...

07:46.367 --> 07:50.034
Yes, and he's convinced that his
father will try to get the boy

07:50.100 --> 07:52.100
and the circuit board.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.100
How's he gonna do that?

07:54.167 --> 07:56.034
We can verify the authenticity
of the board

07:56.100 --> 07:58.134
before we hand over Josh.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.334
You think Jack's concerns
are warranted?

08:00.401 --> 08:03.601
Absolutely. He's Phillip Bauer's
son and he's been more right

08:03.668 --> 08:04.900
than we have today.

08:04.967 --> 08:06.768
Well, point taken there.

08:06.833 --> 08:09.200
All right, let's say
we refuse to give up Josh,

08:09.267 --> 08:11.334
which is the only thing
Phillip Bauer

08:11.401 --> 08:13.467
seems to want.
How do we get the circuit board?

08:13.534 --> 08:16.800
Well, if you don't have
any ideas, I think I might.

08:16.867 --> 08:19.034
Wait. If your idea involves
keeping Daniels in the dark...

08:19.100 --> 08:22.301
Tom, he won't listen
to me, but if you...

08:22.367 --> 08:23.867
My relationship
with the Vice President

08:23.933 --> 08:25.668
is complicated, at best.

08:25.734 --> 08:27.234
I can't be seen making

08:27.301 --> 08:29.067
an end run around him.

08:29.134 --> 08:33.067
But I promise I won't be
looking your way if you do.

08:49.134 --> 08:50.734
(cell phone rings)

08:55.601 --> 08:56.900
(snaps phone shut)

08:59.401 --> 09:01.567
Hey. Hey!

09:01.634 --> 09:04.501
That's personal.
Nothing you need in there.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.534
Mr. Buchanan, our subpoena
covers everything. I'm sorry.

09:06.601 --> 09:09.534
It's a family photo album,
for crying out loud.

09:09.601 --> 09:11.100
You haven't been
charged with

09:11.167 --> 09:14.634
any crimes yet,
but that could change.

09:17.634 --> 09:19.867
(phone rings)

09:22.034 --> 09:23.434
RECORDING:
You've reached
the Buchanan residence.

09:23.501 --> 09:24.900
Please leave a message.

09:24.967 --> 09:28.067
HAYES:
Bill, I know you're there.
Please pick up.

09:28.134 --> 09:31.434
Look, I know
you don't want
to talk to me,

09:31.501 --> 09:33.501
but I really need
your help.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.601
I don't know where else
to turn.

09:40.267 --> 09:42.768
What do you mean, you don't know
where else to turn?

09:42.833 --> 09:43.768
Are you okay?

09:43.833 --> 09:44.900
No, I'm fine.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.800
I just...
I really need your help.

09:46.867 --> 09:47.967
I'm listening.

09:48.034 --> 09:49.800
Thank you.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.467
I know that you're angry
with me, and I don't blame you.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.100
What do you need
from me, Karen?

09:54.167 --> 09:56.668
I just got off
the phone with Jack.

09:56.734 --> 09:58.634
He's being held
in custody by CTU.

09:58.701 --> 09:59.634
Why?

09:59.701 --> 10:00.867
Because they don't want him

10:00.933 --> 10:02.967
to interfere
with an ongoing operation.

10:03.034 --> 10:04.000
What operation?

10:04.067 --> 10:05.234
Phillip Bauer

10:05.301 --> 10:06.634
is now in possession
of the component.

10:06.701 --> 10:08.200
What?

10:08.267 --> 10:10.534
And he's claiming that he will
trade the sub-circuit board

10:10.601 --> 10:13.067
for his grandson,
but Jack thinks it's a setup;

10:13.134 --> 10:14.701
that Phillip will
get the boy,

10:14.768 --> 10:15.967
keep the component,

10:16.034 --> 10:17.900
and make a deal
with the Chinese.

10:17.967 --> 10:19.467
I completely agree.

10:19.534 --> 10:21.134
Have you spoken
to Nadia Yassir?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.867
Oh, she won't budge
on this thing.

10:22.933 --> 10:25.000
She's under direct orders
from the Vice President.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.334
What are you asking
me to do, Karen?

10:34.334 --> 10:37.034
Whatever it takes
to stop the exchange.

10:55.401 --> 10:57.167
Nadia,

10:57.234 --> 10:59.234
we just touched down
at the meeting point

10:59.301 --> 11:00.833
and I'm not seeing any activity.

11:00.900 --> 11:03.200
Satellite surveillance
confirms that.

11:03.267 --> 11:05.301
How's the signal
on Josh's tracker?

11:05.367 --> 11:06.534
Coming in clear.

11:06.601 --> 11:08.367
Tracker's signal's strong.

11:08.434 --> 11:11.301
Wait here.
I'm gonna check it out.

11:34.833 --> 11:37.100
Come on.

11:50.967 --> 11:53.000
(cell phone rings)

11:55.501 --> 11:58.668
CTU, I've got a call coming in.
It could be him.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.234
Morris, can you trace the call?

12:00.301 --> 12:01.567
The signal's scrambled,

12:01.634 --> 12:03.401
but we're still patched
into Doyle's phone,

12:03.467 --> 12:05.634
so we'll be able to listen to
both sides of the conversation.

12:05.701 --> 12:07.434
All right, Mike.
Go ahead. Answer it.

12:07.501 --> 12:09.301
This is Doyle.

12:09.367 --> 12:11.034
Before we do anything,

12:11.100 --> 12:13.467
I want CTU to turn off
the satellite feed.

12:13.534 --> 12:15.334
What are you talking about?

12:17.668 --> 12:20.000
I have an uplink.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.768
I know when
they're watching.

12:21.833 --> 12:24.534
And I know when
they're off-line.

12:24.601 --> 12:26.534
Stand by.

12:26.601 --> 12:30.467
Nadia, can we tell
if he's bluffing?

12:30.534 --> 12:31.900
MORRIS:
Yeah.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.267
He's not bluffing.
He's absolutely in our system.

12:34.334 --> 12:35.067
How?

12:35.134 --> 12:37.100
I don't know.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.668
Mike, we have confirmation that

12:40.734 --> 12:42.933
Phillip Bauer has tapped
into our satellite surveillance.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.734
Can he see
Josh's tracker signal?

12:44.800 --> 12:47.833
No. That's on
an internal network.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.401
All right.
Then go off-line.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.467
Tell LAPD and
the Tac teams

12:51.534 --> 12:52.701
to keep a really
wide perimeter

12:52.768 --> 12:53.800
outside the
satellite area.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.967
We can't afford
to spook him.

12:56.034 --> 12:57.267
Morris, shut down the satellite.

12:57.334 --> 12:59.067
Marcy, let LAPD
and our teams know.

12:59.134 --> 13:00.567
On it.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.701
It's done.

13:03.768 --> 13:05.734
Mike, satellite is off-line.

13:05.833 --> 13:09.100
Mr. Bauer,
CTU's satellite is off-line.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.833
I can see that.

13:12.034 --> 13:13.867
Now get rid of the chopper.

13:15.267 --> 13:16.701
Aerial One,

13:16.768 --> 13:19.534
return to base.
That's an order.

13:27.668 --> 13:29.900
Now, how do you want
to work the exchange?

13:29.967 --> 13:32.668
Wait there. Someone will come.

13:32.734 --> 13:33.668
When?

13:33.734 --> 13:34.833
Whenever I'm damn well

13:34.900 --> 13:36.668
ready.

13:36.734 --> 13:39.234
Put my grandson on the phone.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.167
Your grandfather.
He wants to speak with you.

13:44.234 --> 13:45.567
But don't fight him, Josh.

13:45.634 --> 13:48.034
Okay? The easier he thinks
this is going to go,

13:48.100 --> 13:49.701
the less on-guard
he's going to be.

13:56.534 --> 13:57.967
Yeah.

13:58.034 --> 13:59.833
Hello, Joshua.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.534
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

14:02.601 --> 14:05.668
Yes. And I don't want
to go anywhere with you.

14:05.734 --> 14:08.334
I hate you!

14:08.401 --> 14:09.967
Joshua, listen to me.

14:10.034 --> 14:13.601
I understand you're
frightened and angry.

14:13.668 --> 14:15.800
But your father's
involvement in
what happened today

14:15.867 --> 14:17.267
will soon be
public knowledge.

14:17.334 --> 14:20.167
Staying in this country
is not an option.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.668
There's nothing here for you.

14:21.734 --> 14:23.768
My mom's here.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.634
Your mother can join you
anytime she wants.

14:26.701 --> 14:29.334
But she is incapable of
giving you what you need.

14:29.401 --> 14:33.634
Where we're going, I will
have the means and the power

14:33.701 --> 14:35.234
to help you become
the kind of man

14:35.301 --> 14:36.567
 your father
 <i>should</i> have been.

14:36.634 --> 14:39.534
Now, you think about that.

15:09.067 --> 15:10.967
#No sign of anyone so far.

15:11.034 --> 15:13.301
Yeah. We're still looking for
ways to get satellite coverage

15:13.368 --> 15:14.967
without Phillip Bauer knowing,
but so far,

15:15.034 --> 15:16.934
it looks like
he's covered all his bases.

15:17.001 --> 15:18.268
Yeah. That doesn't surprise me.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.400
How do I verify
the component's real,

15:20.467 --> 15:22.034
once they hand it over?

15:22.101 --> 15:23.400
Chloe?

15:23.467 --> 15:26.134
The component has an R-7-2
socket on its underside.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.001
When you plug
your PDA into that,

15:28.067 --> 15:30.201
I'll be able to verify
the circuitry from here.

15:30.268 --> 15:31.634
Good.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.767
Nadia, once I know
the component's real,

15:37.834 --> 15:40.800
if I see a chance to get the kid
back, I'm gonna take it.

15:40.867 --> 15:41.934
No, you're not, Mike.

15:42.001 --> 15:43.400
Look, I want to see
Josh safe, too,

15:43.467 --> 15:45.001
but we're under strict orders
from the White House.

15:45.067 --> 15:47.400
We're not authorized
to retrieve him
until the component's

15:47.467 --> 15:48.867
back at CTU.

15:48.934 --> 15:51.368
I'm not talking about
what I'm authorized to do.

15:51.433 --> 15:53.667
Well, I am. Mike, there's
too much at stake.

15:53.734 --> 15:56.001
You're not going
off-book on this. Understood?

15:58.600 --> 16:01.067
Mike, do you confirm?

16:01.134 --> 16:03.067
MARCY: Nadia, I have
Karen Hayes on two.

16:03.134 --> 16:05.467
All right. Put it through
to my cell phone.

16:05.533 --> 16:07.067
Mike, I have to take this call.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.567
You're on com
with Chloe and Morris.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.700
Yeah. I'll keep them posted.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.867
Yes, Ms. Hayes?

16:13.934 --> 16:16.334
Nadia, the Vice President
would like to check

16:16.400 --> 16:18.134
on the status
of the trade with Phillip Bauer.

16:18.201 --> 16:19.600
Well, the agent
handling the exchange

16:19.667 --> 16:20.700
is in position with the boy

16:20.767 --> 16:22.101
and he's waiting
to be contacted.

16:22.167 --> 16:23.500
I did tell the White House

16:23.567 --> 16:25.368
that I would report in
as soon as that happened.

16:25.433 --> 16:27.167
Yes, I know,
but I just wanted

16:27.234 --> 16:28.834
to make sure that
everyone's onboard.

16:28.901 --> 16:31.268
That no one,
including yourself,
has any doubts

16:31.334 --> 16:33.467
that this is the right
course of action.

16:33.533 --> 16:34.634
The order comes from
the Vice President.

16:34.700 --> 16:35.767
It's not being
questioned.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.700
What's the status
of Jack Bauer?

16:37.767 --> 16:40.700
He's currently being transferred
to the detention at District.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.167
Good. I need to be able
to view the operation

16:43.234 --> 16:45.767
on your internal
deployment grid.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.067
Do you mind me asking why?

16:50.134 --> 16:52.134
Yes, actually, I do.
The Vice President

16:52.201 --> 16:53.967
wants me
to keep track of Jack Bauer,

16:54.034 --> 16:56.567
so I need the security code now,
please.

16:56.634 --> 16:59.334
Right away.

17:09.134 --> 17:11.834
Log onto the grid on nine-four.

17:11.901 --> 17:14.166
Security code
Alpha-Charlie-November.

17:22.901 --> 17:26.467
Got it. Thank you.

17:27.934 --> 17:29.433
I just got a call
from Security.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.934
You better head over
to the lounge.

17:31.001 --> 17:32.500
Why? What's the problem?

17:32.567 --> 17:33.734
Marilyn Bauer.

17:44.934 --> 17:47.134
I'm not a prisoner,
so stop treating me like one.

17:47.201 --> 17:49.767
I want to see my son,
and I want to see him now!

17:49.834 --> 17:51.800
And if you can't
tell me where he is,

17:51.867 --> 17:54.533
I will find somebody who can!

17:54.600 --> 17:56.800
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

17:56.867 --> 17:58.400
Listen, Mrs. Bauer.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.234
If you just calm down,
we can talk.

18:00.301 --> 18:01.967
Did something happen?
Did he get hurt?

18:02.034 --> 18:03.967
No. Josh is fine.
(sighs)

18:04.034 --> 18:05.234
He's just being
held at Division.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.400
They want to debrief him
while events

18:06.467 --> 18:07.901
are still fresh in his mind.

18:07.967 --> 18:10.001
You have no right to talk
to my son if I'm not there.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.967
He needs to have
a parent present. I want to be

18:12.034 --> 18:14.101
with my son!
I understand what
you're going through.

18:14.167 --> 18:16.800
No! You have no idea
what I'm going through!

18:16.867 --> 18:18.400
And if you don't
get me to him

18:18.467 --> 18:19.967
right now,
I'm going to get our lawyers,

18:20.034 --> 18:21.301
and I will take
this whole place down,

18:21.368 --> 18:22.700
including you!

18:24.368 --> 18:25.734
(muttering)

18:25.800 --> 18:27.001
(phone rings)

18:27.067 --> 18:28.167
O'Brian.

18:28.234 --> 18:29.268
Morris, I need
you to send

18:29.334 --> 18:30.867
additional security
to the lounge area

18:30.934 --> 18:32.834
to escort Mrs. Bauer
to holding.

18:32.901 --> 18:34.700
MARILYN:
I want my son!

18:34.767 --> 18:36.234
You can't keep me here!

18:36.301 --> 18:37.934
They're on their way.

18:38.001 --> 18:40.201
NADIA:
Thanks.
This is Morris O'Brian.

18:40.268 --> 18:42.368
Can I have two additional
security to the lounge area

18:42.433 --> 18:44.368
to escort Marilyn Bauer
to Holding, please?

18:44.433 --> 18:45.967
Thank you.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.600
What?
It doesn't bother you

18:50.667 --> 18:51.600
that we're doing this?

18:51.667 --> 18:53.001
What if we don't
get Josh back?

18:53.067 --> 18:54.433
Phillip Bauer
is a murderer.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.934
I don't like it-- I hate it--
but we have our orders.

18:57.001 --> 18:59.667
Since when do you care
about orders?

18:59.734 --> 19:01.634
We're trying to avoid
starting a war.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.134
Speaking as someone
that placed a lot

19:03.201 --> 19:04.567
of people's lives at risk today,

19:04.634 --> 19:07.301
I can see why it's
necessary. Yes.
Jack thinks

19:07.368 --> 19:08.834
we're being manipulated.

19:08.901 --> 19:11.101
That his father has no intention
of giving us the component back.

19:11.167 --> 19:12.934
I don't think
we can count on Jack

19:13.001 --> 19:15.201
being objective
about his father right now.

19:15.268 --> 19:17.567
Who cares if he's being
objective, if he's right?

19:17.634 --> 19:19.834
Are you actually angry at me?
As if I'm the one

19:19.901 --> 19:21.700
that made the decision
to go through with this?

19:21.767 --> 19:25.034
No. I... It's just
that Josh didn't do anything.

19:25.101 --> 19:26.268
He's innocent.

19:34.134 --> 19:36.800
Chloe, keep a close eye on
Josh's tracker. If that signal

19:36.867 --> 19:38.901
weakens even a little,
I want to know about it

19:38.967 --> 19:40.368
immediately.
I will.

19:45.034 --> 19:46.400
CTU, this is Doyle.

19:46.467 --> 19:47.967
You're on with O'Brian.

19:48.034 --> 19:49.934
I've got a helicopter
approaching out of the north.

19:50.001 --> 19:52.268
It's too far
to read its markings.

19:52.334 --> 19:53.734
You think it might
be Phillip Bauer?

19:53.800 --> 19:54.734
I don't know, Morris.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.167
That's why I'm asking you.

19:56.234 --> 19:57.667
All right.
No need to get testy.

19:57.734 --> 20:00.533
Pulling up the FAA database now.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.834
Coast Guard has
a helicopter patrol

20:03.901 --> 20:05.368
just west of
your position.

20:05.433 --> 20:06.368
It's not Phillip Bauer.

20:06.433 --> 20:07.734
All right. Thanks.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.500
Doyle?
Yeah?

20:09.567 --> 20:12.067
I know that a lot
of people disagree
with this operation.

20:12.134 --> 20:14.334
I just want you to know
that what you're doing,

20:14.400 --> 20:17.034
I think, is
absolutely necessary.

20:17.101 --> 20:20.234
Morris, the next time
I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.134
Fair enough.

20:39.234 --> 20:40.634
What is this lunatic doing?

20:40.700 --> 20:41.800
(horn honking)

20:41.867 --> 20:43.201
(tires screeching)

20:55.600 --> 20:56.734
Don't move.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.001
Get your handcuffs out.

20:59.067 --> 21:00.767
Do it!

21:04.700 --> 21:06.034
Mr. Buchanan?

21:07.567 --> 21:08.967
What the hell are you doing?

21:09.034 --> 21:10.600
You have Jack Bauer in there?

21:10.667 --> 21:13.134
TURNER:
We have orders to transport
him to Detention at District.

21:13.201 --> 21:14.834
I need you to release
him to me.

21:14.901 --> 21:16.234
Mr. Buchanan, you've been
relieved of duty.

21:16.301 --> 21:17.901
You know me, Turner.
I'm no threat to anyone.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.368
I'm not even armed.
Stay where you are, sir.

21:19.433 --> 21:21.400
You're not going
to shoot me, Turner.
Sir, you need to

21:21.467 --> 21:23.634
stop coming at me. You know
what I'll have to do.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.667
You don't have
to do anything.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.533
You're a good
man, Turner.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.167
I trained you.
I know you can't
possibly believe

21:29.234 --> 21:30.567
what's happening
here is right.

21:30.634 --> 21:33.867
I know you're
following orders,

21:33.934 --> 21:36.767
but your oath of allegiance
is not to one single person.

21:36.834 --> 21:39.368
You swore to uphold
the Constitution
of the United States.

21:39.433 --> 21:42.634
The orders you're
following are illegal.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.134
You have an opportunity
here, Turner.

21:45.201 --> 21:46.567
Don't blow it.

21:46.634 --> 21:49.334
Agent Turner, put
the weapon down.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.334
Put it down.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.368
They hand Josh over
to my father yet?

21:55.433 --> 21:56.934
No. Doyle's in position
with the boy.

21:57.001 --> 21:58.533
He's awaiting instructions
from your father.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.134
Okay.

22:01.201 --> 22:03.067
Let's go.

22:19.368 --> 22:21.134
Karen explain
everything to you?

22:21.201 --> 22:22.400
Yeah.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.734
Thank you for doing this.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.667
You don't have to thank me.

22:25.734 --> 22:28.467
You put yourself on the line.
I appreciate it.

22:28.533 --> 22:31.067
Let's just hope you're right
about your father.

22:31.134 --> 22:34.167
Unfortunately, I am.

23:03.534 --> 23:05.200
#Thank you.

23:05.267 --> 23:07.267
(whispers):
Stuart...

23:15.767 --> 23:17.868
Morris...

23:17.934 --> 23:19.534
find out who that is.

23:29.133 --> 23:30.667
I'm so sorry.

23:30.734 --> 23:33.200
I don't believe we've met.

23:33.267 --> 23:34.868
Morris O'Brian.

23:34.934 --> 23:37.067
This is Stuart-- Milo's brother.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.968
Oh, I'm so very sorry.

23:41.033 --> 23:42.133
Very sorry.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.000
I have to sign a release
for his body.

23:44.067 --> 23:45.501
I'll help you
with the paperwork.

23:45.567 --> 23:46.534
Come on.

23:46.601 --> 23:48.167
Thanks, Chloe.

23:48.234 --> 23:50.834
He was
a good man.

23:59.934 --> 24:01.734
It's Milo's brother, Stuart.

24:21.901 --> 24:25.000
(phone ringing)

24:25.067 --> 24:26.400
Hi, Karen.

24:26.467 --> 24:28.667
Hi.
I've got Jack.
We're on our way.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.601
I just... I wanted
to thank you.

24:31.667 --> 24:35.100
You didn't have to do this.
You made a big sacrifice.

24:35.167 --> 24:36.734
I'm not the only one.

24:36.801 --> 24:39.601
Won't be long before
they figure out how I
was able to locate Jack.

24:39.667 --> 24:42.133
Yeah, well,
they already have.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.234
I've just been
denied access.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.334
They're probably on their way
to arrest me.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.167
Listen...

24:49.234 --> 24:51.868
I don't know when they'll let us
speak to each other again,

24:51.934 --> 24:54.467
so I just want you to know
that I'm so sorry.

24:54.534 --> 24:58.167
And I love you very much.

24:58.234 --> 25:00.267
Me, too.

25:04.167 --> 25:05.801
They're here.

25:05.868 --> 25:08.167
Good luck.

25:12.167 --> 25:15.501
They're about
to arrest Karen.

25:22.701 --> 25:23.901
Hi.

25:23.968 --> 25:25.334
Stuart?

25:25.400 --> 25:27.367
Yeah.

25:27.434 --> 25:29.400
I'm Nadia Yassir,
acting head of CTU.

25:29.467 --> 25:31.367
We're in the middle
of an operation right now,

25:31.434 --> 25:32.767
so I don't have much time.

25:32.834 --> 25:35.501
I just wanted to meet you
and tell you how sorry I am.

25:35.567 --> 25:38.267
I know your name.
My brother talked about you.

25:41.601 --> 25:43.601
I'd like to know
how he died.

25:49.100 --> 25:52.200
Your brother died
saving my life.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.100
He saw that I was in danger,

25:56.167 --> 25:58.467
and he stood up for me
and sacrificed himself.

25:58.534 --> 26:00.067
He was very brave.

26:00.133 --> 26:02.033
No, he wasn't.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.634
Not really.

26:04.701 --> 26:07.400
It's more that he was
really in love with you.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.667
(phone ringing)

26:11.734 --> 26:13.834
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

26:18.501 --> 26:20.634
Yeah, Chloe, go ahead.

26:20.701 --> 26:22.901
Local police found
Agents Ryan and Turner

26:22.968 --> 26:24.467
handcuffed to their vehicle.

26:24.534 --> 26:26.534
Jack escaped? How?

26:26.601 --> 26:29.467
They were intercepted
by Bill Buchanan.

26:29.534 --> 26:31.501
Are you sure?
Positive.

26:31.567 --> 26:33.734
Why would Bill do
something like that?

26:33.801 --> 26:35.434
Probably because
he agrees with Jack

26:35.501 --> 26:36.801
that we shouldn't be
trading Josh

26:36.868 --> 26:37.901
or trusting his father,

26:37.968 --> 26:39.300
regardless of what
the orders are.

26:39.367 --> 26:41.734
Have Tac teams in the area

26:41.801 --> 26:43.067
move into position
to intercept them.

26:43.133 --> 26:44.634
They're already doing that.

26:46.434 --> 26:49.667
I'm sorry, I had to, uh...

26:59.400 --> 27:00.901
Mr. Doyle...

27:00.968 --> 27:02.767
Yeah?

27:05.033 --> 27:08.701
Listen, please don't do this.

27:10.167 --> 27:12.601
Okay, my grandpa's crazy.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.868
Okay, just please,
just let me go.

27:21.667 --> 27:27.000
Josh... your country
needs you to do this.

27:27.067 --> 27:30.868
I'll get you
back, Josh.

27:30.934 --> 27:32.901
I give you my word.

27:35.601 --> 27:37.934
Doyle, this is Nadia.
Do you copy?

27:38.000 --> 27:39.033
Go ahead, Nadia.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.734
Any sign of
Phillip Bauer yet?

27:40.801 --> 27:41.801
None yet.

27:41.868 --> 27:42.934
Mike, Jack escaped
from custody.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.868
We have to assume
he's on his way to you

27:44.934 --> 27:46.234
to try and stop
the exchange.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.400
How the hell does Jack
even know where we are?

27:48.467 --> 27:50.934
Karen Hayes told him
and gave him your location.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.868
Bill Buchanan
helped him escape.

27:52.934 --> 27:54.000
Damn it.

27:54.067 --> 27:55.767
I've got Tac teams
ready to move in.

27:55.834 --> 27:58.000
Look, you know we can't
bring more men in.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.467
Phillip Bauer will
spot them on satellite

27:59.534 --> 28:00.767
and he'll pull
out of this.

28:00.834 --> 28:03.133
Then you'll have
to face him alone.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.200
I'll be fine.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.234
Is my uncle coming?

28:08.300 --> 28:10.100
Yeah.

28:31.767 --> 28:34.033
#Excuse us, please.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.734
(door closes)

28:40.734 --> 28:41.901
I assume you know

28:41.968 --> 28:44.033
why I ordered your detention.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.834
I do.

28:45.901 --> 28:47.567
Then you admit to using
information

28:47.634 --> 28:49.701
you got from CTU to assist
Bill Buchanan

28:49.767 --> 28:51.701
in breaking Jack Bauer
out of custody.

28:51.767 --> 28:53.267
Yes, I do, sir.

28:55.634 --> 28:58.234
Karen...

28:58.300 --> 28:59.801
you and I have had
our differences,

28:59.868 --> 29:01.834
but I thought that we
had worked past them,

29:01.901 --> 29:04.200
that you and I had finally
reached an understanding.

29:04.267 --> 29:07.100
Clearly, I was mistaken.

29:07.167 --> 29:09.367
What in the hell

29:09.434 --> 29:10.868
were you thinking?

29:10.934 --> 29:14.267
I learned a hard lesson
today, sir,

29:14.334 --> 29:15.467
when I trusted Fayed.

29:15.534 --> 29:16.868
What lesson was that?

29:16.934 --> 29:19.033
Never negotiate

29:19.100 --> 29:20.567
with a sociopath.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.767
Phillip Bauer is
a sociopath.

29:22.834 --> 29:24.968
We can't trust
that he'll give us
that component

29:25.033 --> 29:27.434
whether we give him
the boy or not.

29:27.501 --> 29:29.968
Damn it, Karen, that is
not your call to make.

29:31.968 --> 29:33.300
I understand that, sir.

29:33.367 --> 29:35.234
I wouldn't have done
what I did

29:35.300 --> 29:37.701
if I wasn't willing to accept
the consequences.

29:37.767 --> 29:40.767
Oh, believe me, there will
be consequences.

29:40.834 --> 29:42.667
I will make sure that you
and your husband

29:42.734 --> 29:44.567
go down hard for this.

29:48.534 --> 29:50.367
(sighs)

29:52.000 --> 29:53.467
You know, it was Tom Lennox

29:53.534 --> 29:55.467
who said your different
point of view would be

29:55.534 --> 29:57.501
an asset to my team,
and I believed him.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.434
Was he in on this with you?

30:01.501 --> 30:03.567
No, sir.

30:03.634 --> 30:05.601
He didn't know anything
about this.

30:16.234 --> 30:19.234
Karen...

30:19.300 --> 30:22.434
if Jack Bauer prevents this
exchange from happening,

30:22.501 --> 30:25.167
the Russians will attack
our forces in Central Asia.

30:26.968 --> 30:31.100
Any blood that is spilled
will be on you.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.634
(knocks twice)

30:38.601 --> 30:40.167
(door closes)

30:44.834 --> 30:47.133
(phone ringing)

30:48.267 --> 30:50.667
CTU, I've got
an incoming call.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.801
Yeah.

30:52.868 --> 30:55.167
Take Josh and walk
toward the water.

30:55.234 --> 30:56.467
We're on our way.

30:56.534 --> 30:58.901
Nadia, did you
get that?

30:58.968 --> 31:01.033
Yes. Agent Doyle,
be careful.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.400
We need to go, Josh.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.801
Tracker shows them moving

31:16.868 --> 31:19.067
towards the water.

31:19.133 --> 31:21.501
MORRIS:
Chloe...

31:21.567 --> 31:22.567
Chloe.

31:23.868 --> 31:26.000
You all right?
You look a little pale.

31:26.067 --> 31:28.133
I'm fine. Just tired.

31:31.100 --> 31:34.033
(distant whooshing)

31:34.100 --> 31:36.534
You hear that?
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.868
NADIA:
Mike, what do you have?

31:45.934 --> 31:49.167
Nadia, we got two men
in a small watercraft
coming ashore.

31:49.234 --> 31:50.667
We're taking cover.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.734
(motor humming)

32:07.133 --> 32:09.000
You stay here,
understand?

32:09.067 --> 32:10.968
Don't move.

32:22.901 --> 32:24.834
Stop right there.

32:31.133 --> 32:32.968
Send the kid down now.

32:33.033 --> 32:35.067
Show the sub-circuit
board first.

32:37.534 --> 32:39.567
I need to verify it.

32:39.634 --> 32:41.300
Walk forward.

32:43.067 --> 32:45.367
Place it down.

32:45.434 --> 32:46.801
Back up.

33:00.133 --> 33:01.234
(screams)

33:01.300 --> 33:02.467
Mike!

33:02.534 --> 33:04.200
Mike, report in.

33:05.667 --> 33:07.334
(grunting)

33:11.601 --> 33:13.367
There they are.
They've got Josh.

33:25.167 --> 33:28.868
I don't have a clear shot
without putting Josh at risk.

33:28.934 --> 33:31.334
(gunfire)

33:31.400 --> 33:32.167
Get down!

33:48.601 --> 33:49.567
Doyle!

33:49.634 --> 33:50.701
We're gonna get you help.

33:50.767 --> 33:53.300
The component was a fake.
It blew.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.400
Take it easy, Doyle.

33:54.467 --> 33:55.467
Help's on the way.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.834
Stay with him,
I'm calling CTU.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.834
(Doyle groaning)

34:03.267 --> 34:04.534
Mr. Bauer.

34:04.601 --> 34:05.801
PHILLIP:
Yeah.

34:05.868 --> 34:07.701
We got the boy.

34:07.767 --> 34:09.199
Be sure to scan him.

34:09.266 --> 34:10.634
I don't trust CTU.

34:10.701 --> 34:12.400
Yes, sir.

34:15.601 --> 34:17.900
(whirring)

34:17.967 --> 34:20.266
(rapid beeping)

34:20.333 --> 34:22.167
They tagged him.

34:22.234 --> 34:23.434
Short it out.

34:24.501 --> 34:26.400
(electrical whoosh)
(yells)

34:26.467 --> 34:27.868
It's done.

34:27.934 --> 34:29.199
(computer blips)

34:30.266 --> 34:31.234
We lost the tracker.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.501
Try the backup frequency.

34:32.567 --> 34:33.734
I did, it's gone.

34:33.801 --> 34:35.601
Morris, get that satellite
back up now.

34:35.667 --> 34:37.199
I'm doing it.
(telephone rings)

34:37.266 --> 34:38.701
CTU, Reynolds.

34:38.766 --> 34:40.534
This is Bauer.
Patch me through to Nadia.

34:40.601 --> 34:41.967
I got Jack Bauer on the line.

34:42.033 --> 34:43.167
Put it on speakerphone.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.601
Jack, this is Nadia.
Go ahead.

34:47.667 --> 34:49.199
Nadia, I'm at the beach.

34:49.266 --> 34:51.734
The component they delivered
to Doyle was a copy.

34:51.801 --> 34:53.467
The case was loaded
with explosives.

34:53.534 --> 34:55.501
They detonated it.
Doyle's been badly injured.

34:55.567 --> 34:57.033
We need a trauma team
here now.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.400
I'm on it.
Aerial One.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.400
Aerial One, return
to the drop-off point.

35:00.467 --> 35:02.501
As we arrived, two of
my father's men and Josh

35:02.567 --> 35:04.400
were headed out to sea
in a small boat.

35:04.467 --> 35:06.267
Jack, they just disabled
Josh's tracker.

35:06.334 --> 35:08.267
Your father forced us
to shut down satellite,
so it's gonna take us

35:08.334 --> 35:10.701
a few minutes to get it back
up so we can track them.

35:10.767 --> 35:12.767
How long is it gonna take
to get reinforcements?

35:12.834 --> 35:14.300
Tac teams are
five minutes out.

35:14.367 --> 35:16.667
Jack...

35:16.734 --> 35:18.467
how bad is Agent Doyle?

35:18.534 --> 35:20.367
Bad. We need
that trauma team.

35:20.434 --> 35:22.100
Hurry.

35:42.967 --> 35:44.134
#Sir...

35:44.200 --> 35:45.534
Melinda said
you read the flash

35:45.601 --> 35:47.467
regarding CTU's attempt
to make the exchange.

35:47.534 --> 35:49.401
They're still
trying to track

35:49.467 --> 35:51.734
the watercraft Phillip Bauer's
men used to escape.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.501
They've had no success yet.

35:53.567 --> 35:56.234
Suvarov is expecting my call

35:56.301 --> 35:59.367
to confirm that we've
retrieved the component.

35:59.434 --> 36:02.900
Well, my advice is give CTU
a few more minutes

36:02.967 --> 36:04.601
before we call the Russians.

36:04.668 --> 36:07.100
We could still
get lucky on this.

36:07.167 --> 36:09.367
Karen was right.

36:09.434 --> 36:10.401
Yes, sir.

36:10.467 --> 36:11.668
She certainly was.

36:11.734 --> 36:14.734
And I was wrong.

36:16.034 --> 36:17.768
Not just about...

36:17.833 --> 36:19.867
Karen, but about Wayne Palmer.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.867
I judged his performance
as President unfairly.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.701
What he faced
these past

36:27.768 --> 36:31.301
weeks was
an impossible situation.

36:31.367 --> 36:34.000
Maybe he was right

36:34.067 --> 36:37.334
to reach out to Assad,
I don't know anymore.

36:37.401 --> 36:40.634
You know, Tom...
it's easy

36:40.701 --> 36:43.167
to think you've got
all the answers when none

36:43.234 --> 36:46.134
of the ultimate responsibility
lies with you, but...

36:46.200 --> 36:47.933
(sighs)

36:48.000 --> 36:52.167
Sitting in this chair...

36:52.234 --> 36:57.000
until you sit in this chair,
you don't know anything.

36:57.067 --> 36:58.634
You can't know.

36:58.701 --> 37:01.768
Sir...

37:01.833 --> 37:04.100
in view of the fact
that Karen was right,

37:04.167 --> 37:06.067
you might want
to reconsider

37:06.134 --> 37:08.167
your punitive stance
towards her.

37:08.234 --> 37:10.134
My decision may have been wrong,

37:10.200 --> 37:12.334
but I can't condone
that kind of insubordination.

37:12.401 --> 37:14.100
Sir, you do not
want the facts

37:14.167 --> 37:16.401
of your disagreement with Karen
made public.

37:16.467 --> 37:20.034
And that's exactly what will
happen if you prosecute her.

37:20.100 --> 37:22.301
After this crisis
has passed,

37:22.367 --> 37:24.367
Karen Hayes and
Bill Buchanan

37:24.434 --> 37:27.334
can retire quietly to
their country home in Vermont.

37:27.401 --> 37:29.734
You will be honoring
her service.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.000
It's just a better outcome
all around.

37:32.067 --> 37:35.134
I'll take your advice
under consideration, Tom.

37:35.200 --> 37:40.100
But right now, I need a real-
time update on CTU's progress.

37:40.167 --> 37:41.933
All right, sir.

37:44.768 --> 37:46.900
(door opens)

37:46.967 --> 37:48.234
(door closes)

37:50.534 --> 37:52.668
(sighs heavily)

37:54.067 --> 37:55.900
This is Jack. The trauma
team doesn't believe

37:55.967 --> 37:57.401
that Doyle's injuries
are life threatening,

37:57.467 --> 37:59.768
but he's gonna be blind
in one, if not both eyes.

38:02.701 --> 38:04.367
I should've listened to you,
Jack.

38:04.434 --> 38:06.034
You did what you
thought was right.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.434
Is satellite
back up yet?

38:07.501 --> 38:08.668
Any minute.

38:08.734 --> 38:10.067
But it'll be
next to impossible

38:10.134 --> 38:11.734
to find a craft that
size in the dark.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.200
Their boat had limited range.

38:13.267 --> 38:15.267
They must be meeting up
with a larger vessel.

38:19.734 --> 38:22.634
NADIA:
Jack?
I want you to get me the names

38:22.701 --> 38:25.234
and locations of every
offshore oil platform

38:25.301 --> 38:26.967
within a ten-mile radius.

38:27.034 --> 38:28.200
Wh
What are you thinking?

38:28.267 --> 38:29.601
My father's company,

38:29.668 --> 38:31.833
BXJ, has shelter corporations.

38:31.900 --> 38:34.167
They owned oil leases
up ande coast.

38:34.234 --> 38:36.501
He didn't pick this location
at random.

38:36.567 --> 38:37.534
I'm on it.

38:37.601 --> 38:38.668
All right, Jack,

38:38.734 --> 38:40.567
I'll let you know what we find.
Thanks.

38:59.634 --> 39:01.301
Are you still in the clear?

39:01.367 --> 39:02.601
All clear.

39:02.668 --> 39:03.833
Good.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.467
Dock on the northeast side
of the platform.

39:06.534 --> 39:08.501
Roger that.

39:13.933 --> 39:15.467
They'll bring the boy here?

39:15.534 --> 39:16.734
Yeah.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.534
When do I get my component?

39:18.601 --> 39:21.067
You get it when
they deliver the boy.

39:21.134 --> 39:23.467
Good.

39:23.534 --> 39:26.567
You're making the right choice,
continuing to work with us.

39:26.634 --> 39:29.200
Your mistakes have been totally

39:29.267 --> 39:31.701
unacceptable.

39:31.768 --> 39:34.867
But China is still my future.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.167
(sighs)

40:15.234 --> 40:16.768
(beeps)

40:29.701 --> 40:32.900
Morris, no luck tracing the oil
leases through the CNC servers.

40:32.967 --> 40:35.434
Try the EPA database.

40:35.501 --> 40:38.434
Coastal leases have to have
regulatory approval.

40:38.501 --> 40:41.434
That's a good idea. Nadia'll
have to call in an access code.

40:41.501 --> 40:44.734
Right.
Nadia...

40:44.800 --> 40:45.833
You okay?

40:45.900 --> 40:48.100
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:49.267 --> 40:50.234
Oh, my God, Chloe.

40:50.301 --> 40:52.067
Chloe? Chloe, darling...

40:53.501 --> 40:55.100
You all right?
Can someone please help me?

40:55.167 --> 40:57.601
Darling, darling,
can you hear me?

40:57.668 --> 40:59.134
Can someone please help me?!
