WEBVTT

00:11.303 --> 00:12.888
You know, we could've taken the bus.

00:12.971 --> 00:16.225
-I need to improve my fitness.
-Fitness. Good.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.852
Been working out a little bit myself.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.733
You know, Last Week Marcy was chatty.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.276
Was she?

00:34.034 --> 00:37.162
Okay, here's my theory.
Tell me if I'm close.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.457
You've been undercover
with an FBI task force

00:40.541 --> 00:42.876
on some kinda mission this whole time.
You needed a cover.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.878
That's very close.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.338
Really?

00:46.421 --> 00:48.924
Hey, David, when we get to the hospital,
it's really important

00:49.007 --> 00:51.343
that you help me convince
the doctor to give me an MRI.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.136
You mean another MRI.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.180
What?

00:55.264 --> 00:59.476
Well, the other day, when you had
the seizure, Dr. Lee ordered an MRI.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.769
Why didn't you tell me?

01:00.853 --> 01:03.606
Well, number one, you were unconscious.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.190
Number two,

01:05.273 --> 01:08.360
I'm pretty sure that Last Week Marcy
wouldn't know what an MRI was.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.572
Not to mention the fact that you escaped
the hospital like you were Papillon.

01:11.655 --> 01:15.533
You're certain that the MRI was done
at the hospital that I woke up in?

01:15.618 --> 01:16.952
Yeah.
I was in the waiting room.

01:18.829 --> 01:19.830
Thank you.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.291
Uh, that's all I need.
I'll see you back at the apartment later.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.880
Wait, Marce! No, we had a deal!

01:31.925 --> 01:35.929
Ecclesiastes tells us
that there is a season for everything,

01:36.054 --> 01:39.349
and a time for every event under heaven.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.144
A time to be born and a time to die...

01:43.729 --> 01:47.274
For some of us,
death comes at the end of a long life.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.527
But for many of us,
as it did for Stephen,

01:50.611 --> 01:52.655
death is an unexpected visitor.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.699
Only God can cut the thread.

01:56.659 --> 02:00.453
We must trust in God's plan
for each one of us.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.332
How could you come here?

02:47.042 --> 02:49.461
I thought it was important
to say how sorry I was.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.629
How sorry I am.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.931
You were his best friend.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.476
Was I?

03:05.811 --> 03:07.645
Are you high right now?

03:09.106 --> 03:11.191
Did you come to my son's funeral high?

03:11.274 --> 03:12.985
Marion, it's not worth what you're--

03:13.068 --> 03:14.194
You were there!

03:14.277 --> 03:16.279
The police told me!
You could've called 911!

03:16.363 --> 03:18.073
You could've saved him!

04:09.875 --> 04:11.501
Philip?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.683
Philip! It's time to go!

04:29.061 --> 04:32.522
Come on, man. Coordinates.
I need to know where we're going.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.697
Did you just...

04:41.698 --> 04:44.367
Yeah, just a little. I had to.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.495
-Are you gonna be able to work?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.876
This should help.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.044
It's...

04:55.378 --> 04:58.131
-Don't you wanna know what that is?
-Whatever.

05:00.467 --> 05:04.137
Hey, when you have time,
I need you to download this file

05:04.221 --> 05:06.223
from the hospital.
Doctor's name's right there.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.185
-And what kind of file is this?
-It's an MRI, actually.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.063
Mine.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.899
Yeah, sure. Done.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.609
Okay. Everybody ready?

05:17.692 --> 05:19.152
Just need the where-to.

05:20.695 --> 05:25.116
33.2507 degrees by 74.1003 degrees.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.744
All right.
The incoming traveler arrives at 2133,

05:27.828 --> 05:29.454
and that's at least an hour away.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.078
Hey, are you--

06:10.161 --> 06:13.206
Traveler 3468.
Transition of incoming traveler canceled.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.582
Resume protocols.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.967
How did I get here?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.219
I don't know, but it's a little late
to be riding your bike.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.846
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Are you a policeman?

06:28.931 --> 06:30.557
-No. Yes. Yes.
-Yes.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.767
And you should be at home.
You know the way?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.074
That was creepier than I imagined.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.242
Only prepubescent brains
are malleable enough

06:49.326 --> 06:51.954
to receive and deliver messages
without damage.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.247
I know. Still creepy.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.124
The new traveler was supposed
to give us our next mission.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.542
Well, plans change.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.918
You know,
we could go to the T.E.L.L.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.129
and save the guy
from getting hit by a bus.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.216
That's what happens to the host.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.385
Actually, now he's some poor guy...
after 2133.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.388
Protocol 3, Philip.
We can't interfere.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.266
Two minutes ago,
we were interfering a lot.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.313
A traveler was going
to take over a man's life--

07:18.396 --> 07:21.233
Because the director had plans
for the new traveler.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.901
The host was gonna die either way.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.863
Not "was going to." Is.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.283
It hasn't happened yet.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.701
All we have to do is drive by and say,

07:31.784 --> 07:33.996
"Hey, man!
Look out for the bus!"

07:34.079 --> 07:35.205
And he gets home to his wife tonight.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.165
All right, Philip, that's enough.
You know better.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.126
Yeah.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.502
I know better.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.179
Mmm-mmm, no.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.723
You are not leaving this house
wearing that tie again.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.559
-Why? Why? What's the matter with it?
-Nothing's wrong with it,

07:56.643 --> 07:58.853
but you've been wearing it for three days.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.689
Even on the weekend,
which is kind of weird.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.316
Please tell me you've been changing
your underwear.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.320
Underwear. Right. Um...

08:07.404 --> 08:09.947
You know, I think...
I think I might go tie-less today.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.574
You?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.994
Well, if you do,
make sure someone takes a picture,

08:14.077 --> 08:15.870
-'cause that'll be a first.
-And...

08:16.788 --> 08:20.333
I was thinking maybe we should try
something vegan for dinner tonight.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.584
Vegan?

08:21.668 --> 08:24.879
Yeah, you know, food not sourced
from animals in any way.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.340
Yeah, babe, I know what vegan is...

08:27.424 --> 08:30.302
but you are my tie-wearing carnivore.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.095
Doesn't hurt to try new things.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.889
Mmm. I kind of like the sound of that.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.684
Mmm. But wear the tie.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.317
Have you tried this vegetable?

09:28.401 --> 09:29.736
-Corn?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:29.819 --> 09:30.903
Yeah.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.030
Mmm-hmm.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.660
-Mmm...
-Wrong table, bro.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.828
Hey, babe.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.832
Oh, my God. You okay?

09:44.041 --> 09:45.502
She broke my phone.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.171
I'm so sorry.
You all right? Let me help you up.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.006
It's okay. Come here.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.384
I'll get your bag for you.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.511
<i>We're getting</i>
<i>a description now.</i>

09:54.594 --> 09:56.721
<i>We've arrived in the area.</i>

10:03.895 --> 10:05.855
- Workin' hard?
- Every day.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.690
We just got
this security camera footage

10:07.774 --> 10:10.610
from outside the library the other night.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.737
Two assaults, same assailants.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.990
There's an interesting twist
a few minutes in.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.242
What?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.577
You'll see.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.107
You could've saved me.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.404
I can't save anyone.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.033
"Don't save a life.
Don't take a life."

12:23.451 --> 12:26.413
It's called... Protocol 3.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.562
<i>At least two people</i>
<i>are dead after the Madison Bridge</i>

12:50.645 --> 12:53.898
<i>-suddenly collapsed early this morning...</i>
-Emergency crews set up detours

12:53.981 --> 12:55.817
as they continue to search for survivors.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.445
<i>...while they continue</i>
<i>to search for survivors.</i>

12:58.528 --> 13:01.114
<i>And in other news,</i>
<i>Florida is on high alert with...</i>

13:01.197 --> 13:02.824
-Tropical storms.
<i>-...a tropical storm.</i>

13:02.907 --> 13:04.158
<i>- Winds are gusting--</i>

14:32.246 --> 14:34.874
- You got some explaining to do.
- What?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.752
Look, if you weren't gonna show,
you could at least let me know.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.254
Squash, Saturday morning?

14:41.005 --> 14:43.633
-Squash.
-You forgot, didn't you?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.678
Uh, sorry.
How... how was the squash?

14:46.761 --> 14:48.555
You know,
it's kind of a hard game to play alone.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.515
But, fortunately,
I found a playing partner

14:50.598 --> 14:52.224
who was actually a challenge.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.395
Uh, hey, did you change the password here?

14:56.729 --> 14:59.231
- How many times you punch it in?
- Twice.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.693
Better get it right a third time
or we're gonna be locked out.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.447
What ever happened
with our cyber terrorists?

15:05.530 --> 15:08.450
Oh, uh, dead end.
It was just a bunch of kids.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.327
You probably got
the caps lock on again.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.709
There!

15:17.792 --> 15:19.711
All right. It's time. Let's go.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.128
Where?

15:21.212 --> 15:22.338
It's Monday. Gun range?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.381
- Right! Right.
- You okay?

15:25.508 --> 15:29.136
Absolutely. It's Monday. Let's shoot guns.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.030
Hey.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.075
I went shopping.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.370
Did you sleep?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.622
A little bit.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.749
Yeah...
Sit down, sit down.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.000
I'm fine.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.548
You're taking too large a dose.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.051
No more than eight units.
A quarter up. Okay?

16:11.262 --> 16:14.849
Sterile water, alcoholic wipes, syringes.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.060
Used syringes in there. Okay?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.871
We're not gonna save the world.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.834
Why do you say that?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.711
'Cause it doesn't want to be saved.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.505
So we'll save it anyway.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.675
You know...

16:48.758 --> 16:53.095
depression is a side effect
of heroin addiction.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.889
I'm not depressed.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.892
-Mmm-hmm.
-We're just sitting here...

16:57.975 --> 17:00.812
waiting for orders from the future.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.897
Protocol 5.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.316
Resume your host's life.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.070
My host is a junkie.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.364
What about yours?

17:12.448 --> 17:13.575
We're talking about you right now.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.660
We could be doing so much more, Marcy.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.038
We are doing what we came here to do...

17:19.121 --> 17:21.290
and we knew going into this
that we couldn't fix everything.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.375
That we're not
supposed to fix everything...

17:24.085 --> 17:26.838
and if we do, we could make it worse
without even knowing.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.923
I know.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.592
I know you know.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.554
No more than eight units.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.680
Just enough to be functional.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.890
Any more than that,
I know it's because you want it.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.101
I won't stand for that. Okay?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.185
See ya.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.531
People drop their phones all the time.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.576
She said you pushed her.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.786
I don't even know her.
Why would I push her?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.246
That's my question, Rene.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.707
You know, phones break, not a big deal.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.209
What is a big deal is bullying.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.211
You know, you make your own choices, guys.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.047
For example, you could choose to be a...

18:10.131 --> 18:11.841
-What's the word?
-Douchebag?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.093
That works. Or...

18:14.176 --> 18:16.137
you could choose to be nicer
to those who aren't

18:16.220 --> 18:18.180
as blessed with popularity as you.
It's not hard.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.016
I'm totally nice.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.643
I'm sorry. You're not.

18:22.727 --> 18:23.561
What?

18:23.644 --> 18:26.606
Okay, you can contemplate
your choices in detention.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.190
Ms. Day...

18:28.274 --> 18:30.442
I apologize for my involvement in this,

18:30.526 --> 18:33.529
and I'd like to offer
to replace the girl's phone.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.327
I think she'll appreciate that.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.622
- May I go?
- Yes.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.423
What is wrong with him?

18:53.590 --> 18:55.760
I don't know.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.232
Hey.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.612
Calculated Chaos.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.073
What's that?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.324
A horse.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.868
Put it all on Calculated Chaos.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.788
All of it?

19:23.871 --> 19:25.622
Keep 30% of the winnings.

19:25.707 --> 19:29.460
Distribute the rest 50/50
to these addresses.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.464
Look, Phil, if you owe some money
to a dealer, I--

19:33.547 --> 19:35.174
It's not a dealer.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.218
It's Stephen's mom.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.886
And Gower's family.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.304
The cop?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.389
Why? What do you owe him?

19:44.976 --> 19:45.977
Huh?

19:46.060 --> 19:48.437
Hey, I'll give you some advice
as your lawyer.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.856
You're not my lawyer.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.607
Okay, free advice anyway.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.693
Start throwing money at these people...

19:53.776 --> 19:55.444
it's not the brightest of ideas.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.071
Makes you look guilty.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.282
Make it anonymous.
Put it in their mailbox.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.161
I need you to do this for me.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.128
So, uh...

20:14.130 --> 20:15.798
I have a kid...

20:16.799 --> 20:18.300
who hates me.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.678
So you know what I do
for his 18th birthday?

20:21.763 --> 20:24.056
I buy him a car. New freakin' car.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.059
Well, newish. You know what he does?

20:28.644 --> 20:29.854
He doesn't take it?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.647
Oh, no, no, no, he took it.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.983
'Course he took it. He's not stupid.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.151
But still hates me.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.069
Make the bet.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.612
Drop off the money.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.322
Keep the change.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.331
So these anonymous tips

20:49.415 --> 20:50.833
started coming in early this morning.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.835
One of them led to this whacko

20:52.919 --> 20:54.545
planning on shooting up this bank
in San Fran later.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.963
Where are they coming from?

20:56.047 --> 20:57.799
Well, they're searching
the IP address now.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.806
Well, when it comes in,
we'll check it out.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.856
Since when are you a perfect shot?

21:21.072 --> 21:23.532
So how long have you been
her social worker?

21:23.615 --> 21:26.702
Uh, over a year.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.246
And when was the last time
you saw Marcy?

21:30.747 --> 21:33.125
A few days ago.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.543
Hmm.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.963
I went by her apartment.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.505
Building manager said
he hadn't seen her around.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.341
I went by the library, same story.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.052
You have any idea
where she could be hiding or...

21:44.761 --> 21:46.263
Hiding?

21:46.347 --> 21:48.515
What for?

21:48.599 --> 21:50.852
I don't know.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.942
Well, uh, if she does show up,
let her know I'd like

21:58.025 --> 21:59.318
to speak with her about pressing charges.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.737
Uh, she won't be pressing charges.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.656
But we have... their faces.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.783
Yeah, she wants to move past this.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.911
Did she tell you that, David?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.454
Yeah, she did.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.624
Well, did she tell you that
she kicked the shit out of those boys?

22:17.544 --> 22:21.966
You knew she was capable of this? Hmm?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.760
Well, I think that, uh,

22:24.844 --> 22:27.638
when people are in fight-or-flight mode,
that they're capable of--

22:27.721 --> 22:30.266
Fight-or-flight?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.643
Yeah, it's instinct.
People either fight, or they...

22:34.270 --> 22:35.980
you know, fly.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.440
Has Marcy been acting differently lately?

22:38.524 --> 22:41.986
Like a personality change, or...

22:44.863 --> 22:46.198
No.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.953
Well, all right.

22:51.870 --> 22:56.000
Well, if you do notice anything,
I'll leave my card.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.336
Hey, you hold on to those photos.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.672
Marcy might want to have to take a look.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.106
Thank you.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.032
This is not good, Marcy.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.619
He can't know you've been staying here,
not even for a few days.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.580
It's completely inappropriate.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.085
I'm your social worker, for God's sake.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.754
So we don't tell anyone.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.497
Here's another one, Mac.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.707
Islamic extremist in Chicago

25:00.791 --> 25:03.294
is planning on bombing
the train to O'Hare.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.213
They checked it out,
guy's apartment was full of IEDs.

25:06.297 --> 25:07.839
Really?

25:07.923 --> 25:11.677
And that, uh, IP address? That tip?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.721
It's 10 minutes from here.
Let's go check it out.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.225
It's my wife.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.145
Hey... honey.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.064
I got a messenger.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.940
We have a mission...

25:25.023 --> 25:26.024
sweetie.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.319
-Tell her I said hi.
-Forbes says hi.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.113
- <i>Awkward.</i>
- She says hi back. What is it?

25:31.197 --> 25:32.823
<i>We've got a mission. Now.</i>

25:32.906 --> 25:34.991
Okay, I'll meet you at home?

25:35.867 --> 25:39.080
Uh, Carly's.
It's closer to where we need to be.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.623
<i>- I'll be right there.</i>

25:42.583 --> 25:45.252
She's not feeling great,
wants me to take her to a doctor.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.629
-Is it serious?
-I doubt it, but, you know.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.590
Yeah, of course, yeah, go.
Don't worry about it.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.882
I'll check out the address myself.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.009
-I'll call you later.
-Thanks.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.432
Hey!

25:59.683 --> 26:01.935
-You don't think I'm nice?
-Do you think you're nice?

26:03.520 --> 26:05.397
Well, I'm nice to you.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.989
<i>Trevor.</i>

26:17.159 --> 26:18.410
<i>Trevor?</i>

26:18.494 --> 26:19.953
Please stop.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.913
What is wrong with you?

26:24.040 --> 26:25.834
Are you even listening to me?

26:25.917 --> 26:27.544
Who's texting you?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.880
Trevor! Who's texting you?

26:29.963 --> 26:31.590
I gotta go.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.808
What's the message?

26:41.892 --> 26:44.686
Rescue an abducted boy
before he's murdered.

26:44.770 --> 26:45.812
That's it?

26:45.896 --> 26:48.064
I can't remember it verbatim.

26:48.149 --> 26:49.608
You can't remember it verbatim?

26:50.984 --> 26:52.861
Aleksander Andrieko.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.780
Ten-year-old Romanian immigrant.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.532
He went missing
walking home from school

26:56.615 --> 26:58.409
-two months ago.
-Why save him?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.161
I assume he's important to the future.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.412
I've never heard of him.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.913
Well, he's ten, so...

27:02.996 --> 27:05.123
The messenger didn't go into details.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.875
And you can't exactly chat with them.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.920
This one burst into tears and ran away
the second he delivered his message.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.172
Why did the messenger come to you?

27:14.090 --> 27:15.717
Why not you, you mean?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.761
I don't know. Probably not
a lot of prepubescent children

27:17.844 --> 27:19.471
walking around an FBI office.

27:19.555 --> 27:22.641
Maybe it's time-sensitive...
Why are you taking it so personally?

27:22.724 --> 27:23.850
I'm not taking it personally--

27:23.934 --> 27:26.061
Okay, what do we know about the abductors?

27:26.144 --> 27:29.440
There are two of them. Man and a woman.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.816
I know from historical records,

27:30.899 --> 27:33.402
that the victim's body
was found in the basement.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.486
They're dangerous.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.783
You keep a gun in your diaper bag?

27:39.866 --> 27:41.910
It's because
I can't keep all of this...

27:49.293 --> 27:50.836
You've been shopping.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.798
A traveler team dropped off
our armament package yesterday.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.133
You guys pick out what you want.

27:57.218 --> 28:00.304
I'm going to see if my babysitter's home.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.723
Hey. Hey, guys, we're saving a kid,

28:02.806 --> 28:04.266
not invading Normandy.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.313
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Special Agent MacLaren.</i>

28:09.396 --> 28:10.981
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

28:11.064 --> 28:12.399
Hey, partner, it's me.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.651
First address was an empty building,

28:14.735 --> 28:18.864
so our tipster's obviously scrambling
their IP.

28:18.947 --> 28:22.368
We got it narrowed down
to a handful of local servers.

28:22.451 --> 28:25.329
I'm gonna go over my half of the list
of possible addresses in the area,

28:25.412 --> 28:28.457
and I will text you the other half,
so we can cover more ground.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.542
<i>Call me when you're done at the doctor's.</i>

28:35.464 --> 28:37.508
- Com check.
<i>- Yeah, we're up.</i>

28:37.591 --> 28:39.301
Everybody clear on the plan?

28:39.385 --> 28:41.262
Trevor drops us off, we go in back.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.971
- <i>Keep the engine running.</i>
- Will do.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.598
<i>Let's assume they're armed.</i>

28:44.681 --> 28:47.601
We'll keep it clean and easy.
No guns unless I say. Copy?

28:47.684 --> 28:48.769
<i>Copy.</i>

29:45.200 --> 29:46.577
What do you think?

30:07.055 --> 30:09.308
<i>We've got</i>
<i>a vehicle approaching.</i>

30:10.892 --> 30:12.060
Yeah. We see 'em.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.990
Allan and Cathy Whiteman?

30:25.073 --> 30:26.367
Yeah, we are.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.035
FBI. How's your day going so far?

30:29.119 --> 30:30.579
Just like to ask you a few questions.

30:32.456 --> 30:33.707
FBI?

30:34.583 --> 30:35.792
Yes, ma'am.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.462
Mind if we come inside?

30:38.545 --> 30:40.171
Well, that's where we're going.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.550
Damn it, Cathy, you'd better put that out.
You don't want to get a fine for smokin'.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.218
Oh, that's a whole other bureau.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.474
Tobacco, Alcohol, and...
Never mind. Please.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.442
Sorry about the mess.
We don't get a lot of company.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.172
Come on.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.682
Oh...

31:43.652 --> 31:44.903
What is that smell?

31:46.071 --> 31:47.739
Chickens.

31:47.823 --> 31:48.824
In the house?

31:48.907 --> 31:51.618
No! 'Course not. The basement.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.995
We let 'em come and go.
You get used to it.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.539
How can we help you?

31:55.622 --> 31:58.792
We're investigating
some suspicious activity in the area.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.502
Well, Glen and Shirley Duran,

32:00.586 --> 32:03.589
just south of us,
and you didn't hear it from me,

32:03.672 --> 32:05.048
they hire migrant workers.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.341
Cath!

32:06.425 --> 32:08.885
Let 'em ask a damn question
before you go hang the neighbors.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.472
<i>It's all right,</i>
<i>we're not here about them.</i>

32:11.555 --> 32:12.806
<i>Well, it ain't right.</i>

32:12.889 --> 32:15.308
<i>I mean, there's people</i>
<i>around here who need jobs.</i>

33:13.116 --> 33:16.787
A boy who went missing two months ago
was reported seen in the area,

33:16.870 --> 33:18.539
so we're checking with the locals.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.248
Do you know anything about this?

33:20.331 --> 33:21.625
Haven't heard a thing.

33:21.708 --> 33:25.504
'Course, we only go to town for groceries.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.130
Not in the house.

33:27.213 --> 33:28.464
Sorry.

33:29.633 --> 33:30.634
I'm trying to quit.

33:30.717 --> 33:34.345
I am, but it's so damn hard, you know?

33:34.429 --> 33:36.515
I wonder
if your son has heard anything?

33:36.598 --> 33:39.225
I noticed his sneakers in the front hall.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.727
Oh, uh...

33:40.811 --> 33:42.771
I don't think he'd know anything.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.524
Probably not.
I'd still like to ask him, though.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.739
All right.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.286
Patrick!

34:06.836 --> 34:09.047
Philip, slow down, we're making noise.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.175
<i>Patrick!</i>

34:13.594 --> 34:15.136
Patrick!

34:17.347 --> 34:19.515
Patrick!

34:30.318 --> 34:31.319
Oh, shit.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.828
Found a body.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.086
<i>A child,</i>
<i>maybe ten years old.</i>

34:49.921 --> 34:53.424
I'll, uh, I'll just go and see... Oh.

35:08.649 --> 35:11.735
This man would like to ask you
some questions, Patrick.

35:13.654 --> 35:14.946
Hi, Patrick.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.324
I'm with the FBI.
Do you know what that means?

35:18.408 --> 35:19.951
A policeman?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.703
That's exactly right, yes.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.122
-What school do you go to?
-I don't go to school.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.832
We homeschool.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.126
Nothing wrong with that.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.336
Gets a good Christian education.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.672
I'll bet he does.

35:33.715 --> 35:36.134
I'm here to help you, Patrick.

35:36.217 --> 35:39.888
That's not your real name, is it?

35:39.971 --> 35:41.264
No.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.308
What are you saying to him?

35:43.391 --> 35:46.561
Are these your real parents?

35:46.645 --> 35:48.063
- No.
- Allan!

35:49.773 --> 35:52.901
Traveler 3468,
you are off mission.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.236
-Abort immediately.
-What the hell's going on?

35:55.320 --> 35:56.822
We're leaving.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.824
- We are not leaving him!
- Stand down!

35:58.907 --> 36:00.575
There's one child dead already!

36:00.659 --> 36:01.785
-He's next.
-Allan!

36:01.868 --> 36:03.411
Another three children after that.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.664
-We are preventing this!
-We are off mission!

36:05.747 --> 36:07.082
<i>Stand down!</i>

36:07.165 --> 36:08.249
We are not leaving him.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.334
He's our son!

36:35.318 --> 36:38.196
Philip! You're okay.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.869
You're okay.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.536
Okay.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.082
We need to
clean up Philip's blood!

36:49.165 --> 36:50.166
I'm on it. I'm on it.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.335
Trevor, get everybody out of here
and back to ops.

36:52.418 --> 36:55.338
Yeah. Okay.
I got him, I got him, I got him.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.597
Aleksander, are you hurt at all?

37:04.680 --> 37:06.266
Are there any other kids here?

37:06.349 --> 37:08.810
- Just me.
- Okay.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.896
I'm gonna get you home to your mom,

37:10.979 --> 37:14.733
but I need you to do something
very important for me. Okay?

37:14.816 --> 37:17.402
Police officers will be here soon.
They're gonna ask you what happened.

37:17.485 --> 37:21.114
It's really important you tell them
I was the only person here.

37:22.115 --> 37:23.366
Okay?

37:23.449 --> 37:26.119
You asked me for help.
They got afraid and started shooting.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.203
You understand?

37:29.831 --> 37:32.542
That's what happened. Right?

37:32.625 --> 37:33.877
Yes.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.421
Good.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.214
Thank you.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.675
You're welcome.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.639
Forbes?

37:55.899 --> 37:57.901
You should've called for backup.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.904
It's supposed to be
a routine IP address check.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.405
Got out of hand real fast.

38:02.488 --> 38:06.242
So our vigilante's fake IP addresses
led us to these abductors?

38:06.326 --> 38:07.994
That's a crazy coincidence.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.830
Unless he wanted us here.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.707
Another tip, if you think about it.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.377
So how does one person
have all this information? Explain that.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.628
I can't.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.970
-At least the boy's okay.
-Yeah.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.721
You get my message?

38:26.805 --> 38:29.099
-Been a little busy.
-Yeah.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.767
I was starting on your half
of the list when you called.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.644
Yeah? Where's that?

38:33.728 --> 38:37.107
Old garage, downtown.
Fourth and Millwood.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.861
I'll, uh, check that out on my way home.

38:40.944 --> 38:43.613
-You sure?
-Yeah. Yeah, you go. I got it covered.

38:43.696 --> 38:44.697
All right.

38:44.780 --> 38:47.617
Oh, um... How's Kathryn?

38:47.700 --> 38:48.743
Hmm?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.370
She went to the doctor's?

38:50.453 --> 38:52.497
Oh. Yeah. She's... she's fine.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.082
Okay. All right.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.436
It's okay. Come here.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.771
The director doesn't know.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.773
-What?
-What it's like.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.318
It's okay.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.070
- Okay.
- Is he gonna be okay?

39:24.154 --> 39:26.822
- Hold him still.
- Okay. I got him.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.160
Trevor. Door.

39:30.243 --> 39:31.577
Hold on!

39:36.124 --> 39:37.292
Hey.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.711
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.258
Hold him still!

40:02.650 --> 40:03.651
Okay.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.156
Carly, lift his shirt up.

40:16.289 --> 40:18.083
Okay. Apply pressure there.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.960
Okay.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.722
Whoa, Philip.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.490
<i>Ten-year-old</i>
<i>Aleksander Andrieko,</i>

40:50.573 --> 40:52.325
<i>abducted two months ago,</i>

40:52.408 --> 40:56.871
<i>was today found by the FBI</i>
<i>and reunited with his grateful mother.</i>

40:56.955 --> 41:01.084
<i>Authorities say his abductors were killed</i>
<i>in an exchange of gunfire with FBI--</i>

41:01.167 --> 41:03.003
If you guys wanna head out...

41:03.086 --> 41:04.587
We're not going anywhere.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.301
There was no messenger.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.470
No.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.555
You've been sending tips to the FBI.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.641
Yeah.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.019
Jesus, I don't even know
if I can cover this up.

41:20.186 --> 41:23.023
We have all of this knowledge,
and we do nothing.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.651
What is this?

41:26.734 --> 41:28.361
Deaths.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.904
I've memorized all of it.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.822
Why can't we prevent some of it?

41:31.906 --> 41:33.491
Because there are rules!

41:34.409 --> 41:35.701
Don't take a life...

41:35.785 --> 41:37.037
I get.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.414
But what's wrong with saving one?
An innocent kid.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.624
You can't tell me
we didn't just do a good thing!

41:41.707 --> 41:43.084
It's not up to us!

41:43.168 --> 41:45.461
-A boy almost died.
-Yeah, I know that!

41:45.545 --> 41:47.797
And we saved him.
I'm not ashamed of that.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.840
We don't get to decide.

41:49.924 --> 41:53.386
Every change we make
has the potential to alter the future.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.138
Isn't that what we're here to do?

41:55.221 --> 41:58.558
The FBI found you in one day, Philip!
One day!

41:58.641 --> 42:00.726
Because you think
you know better than the director.

42:00.810 --> 42:01.894
The director.

42:01.977 --> 42:04.480
Who the fuck do you think you are?

42:07.650 --> 42:08.776
Nobody.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.197
I don't think I have any other choice.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.532
- He's addicted to heroin.
- He's what?

42:17.243 --> 42:18.619
He inherited it from his host.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.414
Why would the director put you
in the body of a heroin addict?

42:21.497 --> 42:25.751
The historical record said that he died
after the first time that he used.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.464
His parents were probably in denial.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.548
We were trying to manage it.

42:30.631 --> 42:33.093
You know...
I thought it was under control.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.429
It's so hard.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.849
Yeah. I'll bet.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.393
Who else knew?

42:45.105 --> 42:46.731
Just me.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.234
You can manage this? Wean him off it?

42:50.735 --> 42:52.362
In time, yes.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.199
Well...

42:57.492 --> 42:59.244
Time, I know something about.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.070
Don't you have a test
in the morning or something?

44:16.154 --> 44:18.823
Yeah, but I don't gotta study
for this one.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.409
It's history.

44:23.911 --> 44:24.995
Here.

44:26.581 --> 44:30.000
I've developed a new appetite for life.

44:31.294 --> 44:33.963
You just inhale the intoxicating aroma.

44:37.425 --> 44:40.678
- Meat?
- It's ground meat.

44:42.222 --> 44:44.432
You know they don't actually grow that
in the ground, right?

44:44.515 --> 44:46.642
I'm not asking any questions.

44:46.726 --> 44:49.103
I'm embracing the 21st century.

44:50.855 --> 44:53.358
Save it for later.

44:53.441 --> 44:55.443
This you want.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.869
Mmm...

45:10.708 --> 45:12.084
So...

45:13.253 --> 45:15.671
this is a list
of potential host candidates?

45:16.922 --> 45:19.634
Yeah. Not all of them, obviously.

45:27.850 --> 45:30.227
Then all these people are gonna die?

45:31.521 --> 45:32.813
Yeah.

45:34.064 --> 45:35.858
Why? What's wrong?

45:40.821 --> 45:42.657
I know this person.
