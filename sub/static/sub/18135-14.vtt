your highness.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.162
(GROUND RUMBLING)

00:30.197 --> 00:32.064
Do you hear that?

00:35.969 --> 00:37.602
A man? Here?

00:37.637 --> 00:38.970
The man.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.440
Lex Luthor.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.243
HIPPOLYTA: Careful, I've heard
Diana speak of this one.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.288
(GROANING)

00:56.323 --> 00:58.223
And now, Your Highness,

00:58.258 --> 01:01.426
I'll trouble you for the
Oculus of the Argo.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.695
You know about the Oculus?

01:03.730 --> 01:06.465
Hippolyta, don't make
me ask twice.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.301
Once was enough.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.003
This staff will lead
you right to it.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.139
Uh-uh. Too easy.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.411

01:41.134 --> 01:43.168
Wonder Woman! What an honor!

01:43.203 --> 01:46.037
Luckily I dressed
for the occasion.

01:46.072 --> 01:49.241
Your battle suit may be
invulnerable. You aren't.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.179
Circe!

01:54.214 --> 01:57.516
That's right.
The witch is back.

02:05.825 --> 02:10.762
Circe! You're working with
this, this man?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.598
What can he do for you that
you can't do for yourself?

02:13.633 --> 02:16.368
For starters, I dig bald guys.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.208
Also, he can do that for me.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.223
It's my Hands of Hercules
spell.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.325
She's in a tight squeeze,

02:40.360 --> 02:42.260
which I can make tighter.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.995
(RUMBLING)

02:44.030 --> 02:45.530
(GRUNTS)

02:45.565 --> 02:49.401
Give us your staff,
and we'll let her live.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.170
I'd happily give her life and
every other Amazon's

02:52.205 --> 02:55.440
before I'd let the two of you
have that kind of power.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.443
If that's the way you want it.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.246
(GRUNTING)

03:06.519 --> 03:07.819

03:22.335 --> 03:25.237

-With pleasure.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.619
Easy.
The Amazons can be prickly.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.742
(PANTING) Thanks, guys.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.744
(SIGHS)

04:05.779 --> 04:09.781
Diana!
These men are your friends?

04:09.816 --> 04:12.985
Uh, more like
sidekicks, mother.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.021
Forgive us for intruding,
Your Highness.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.956
We were tracking Lex Luthor.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.624
His trail led us here.

04:19.659 --> 04:23.061
He and Circe have breached
the Fallen Realm, Diana.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.730
The Fallen Realm?

04:25.665 --> 04:28.033
Okay, what's the Fallen Realm?

04:28.068 --> 04:30.235
A very bad place.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.871
-And Circe, she's a witch.
-Figures.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.873
Who else would
team up with Luthor?

04:34.908 --> 04:38.410
The two of them want
the Oculus of the Argo.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.211
It's an artifact from
the early gods.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.415
According to legend,
when a mortal man
puts on the Oculus

04:43.450 --> 04:45.750
he can attain
the power of Zeus.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.052
Got it.

04:47.087 --> 04:51.189
Hera, Queen of the Gods,
tasked me with keeping
it safe.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.891
And I failed.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.327
Can you get us to this
Fallen Realm without
your staff?

04:55.362 --> 04:58.630
-We'll get it back for you,
Your Highness.
-Diana.

04:58.665 --> 05:03.335
Tell your sidekicks never to
address me directly again.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.305
And to fight like
the gods of war.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.179
Infused with the power
of Zeus himself.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.448
And now, mine.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.517
Did I say mine?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.719
Ours, of course. Ours.
(LAUGHS)

06:30.423 --> 06:32.023
And now, if you don't mind,

06:32.058 --> 06:35.494
I'd like to slip into
something more powerful.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.663
Power.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.434
Strength.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.171
Lovely hair!

06:46.206 --> 06:47.906
At last.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.575
We'll rule two worlds
together, Lex.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.511
As king and queen.

06:53.546 --> 06:56.414
Huh? Oh, right. Right.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.349
WONDER WOMAN: Wrong.

06:58.384 --> 07:00.518
He's taken advantage
of you, Circe.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.154
It's what men do.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.757
Some men.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.626

haven't you?

07:29.048 --> 07:30.748
All powerful,
King of the Gods.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.219
I have all of his power.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.788
And all of his hair.

07:36.823 --> 07:39.024
I've faced an immortal
or two before.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.228
Never an immortal
like this one.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.569
(GRUNTS)

07:52.138 --> 07:56.107
This time, you're going to
stay buried, princess.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.010
Mmm, tingly.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.249
Now, what to do with them.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.952
-Circe, please.
-I know!

08:12.191 --> 08:14.859
Trees. I'll leave them
as a warning

08:14.894 --> 08:18.096
to anyone who might
try to cross us.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.765
CIRCE: I was going to turn
them into animals,

08:20.800 --> 08:23.101
but I'm branching out.

08:23.136 --> 08:27.572

now, please?

What's your real plan, Luthor?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.354
(CHUCKLES) My real plan?

08:43.389 --> 08:44.622
Say it.

08:44.657 --> 08:48.226
Well, first I'm going to
conquer Olympus.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.629
And then? What about Circe?

08:51.664 --> 08:53.565
Uh...(SIGHS)

08:53.600 --> 08:56.134
I'm going to ditch her
the minute we take Olympus,
what do you think?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.876
CIRCE: Lex!

09:06.212 --> 09:08.546
Sorry you had to hear that,
my dear.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.648
Just some teeny weeny
white lies

09:10.683 --> 09:13.051
I needed to tell in order
to free myself.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.321
CIRCE: That was the
Lasso of Truth,
you weren't lying.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.890
For once.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.926
I told you we
should have left.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.062
(GROANING)

09:27.900 --> 09:31.569
To think.
I almost made you my equal.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.004
Equal?

09:33.039 --> 09:36.341
(LAUGHS) I'm not your equal!
I'm your superior.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.976
I have the Oculus.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.812
Oh, you're sure about that?

No chance.
