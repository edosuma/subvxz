01:42.436 --> 01:43.394
Master.
 I'm ready.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.229
You must be very tired. Master!
Master! Wipe off your sweat.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.365
Advisor! What is he writing?
Name!

02:37.574 --> 02:40.742
Marvelous! Master can write down
his own name.

02:40.953 --> 02:41.787
Yes.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.710
Good words!

02:49.752 --> 02:50.502
Go away!

02:52.923 --> 02:57.384
Good words! Like dragon flies
and Phoenix dances.

02:57.509 --> 02:58.804
Master!
 It's up-side down.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.473
Tsan-Ar-Ha-Cha-Su!
 Good boy!

03:03.098 --> 03:04.560
But don't be too proud.
 OK?!

03:06.770 --> 03:09.437
Dad! Not many of our
Su-Cha-Ha-Ar Family can write.

03:09.604 --> 03:12.985
Since the founding ancestor.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.944
Now it's different. My son,
your grandson, Tsan, can write.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.906
He can write his own name.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.949
Dad!
 This is very important.

03:21.408 --> 03:24.746
He knows how to write.
He'll be a scholar some day.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.000
He knows how to write.
His children will be better.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.793
Young Master, you should learn
how to write properly.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.169
Cut it out Tsan...

03:31.419 --> 03:32.627
Frame it!

03:32.794 --> 03:34.045
Of course!
 Advisor.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.507
Frame it in the biggest frame.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.092
It's not enough.
 Carry it,

03:38.217 --> 03:39.467
walk on the street 
with a flower.

03:39.718 --> 03:40.762
Go!

03:41.013 --> 03:41.930
Tsan! Come!

03:42.514 --> 03:43.473
Sit down!

03:43.889 --> 03:46.349
I'm so happy to see 
you're excellent.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.354
Listen.
 Your father is spendthrift.

03:50.479 --> 03:52.649
I spoiled all the property.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.775
Actually what I 
mean is prodigal son,

03:53.984 --> 03:56.735
if I die,
you'll have to depend on yourself.

03:56.902 --> 03:58.280
I always depend on myself.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.616
Take the money.
 Don't waste it.

04:02.241 --> 04:03.992
Boiled Egg!
Take my Western style hat to me.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.037
Where are you going? 

04:05.662 --> 04:06.705
I have my birthday today.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.663
How old?

04:08.872 --> 04:10.626
Twenty Five.
 Come visit me earlier.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.877
Why don't you comb your hair?

04:14.127 --> 04:15.670
Don't look like a little beggar.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.007
I would like to be a beggar
if he can make so much money.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.262
This hob is really good.
 Come!

04:23.430 --> 04:24.555
What can I do for you?
 Master!

04:24.932 --> 04:27.684
Look!
His invitation card is made of gold.

04:27.891 --> 04:30.437
Next time I'll have a 
more lavish birthday.

04:49.288 --> 04:52.334
Your Royalty!
Do you like Guangdong Opera?

04:53.418 --> 04:56.463
Beijing opera is better.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.048
But it's not bad.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.427
Tips...

05:04.555 --> 05:06.932
Tips...

05:07.098 --> 05:08.350
Congratulation!

05:08.559 --> 05:10.600
My family are separated, sick,
old or weak.

05:10.725 --> 05:14.189
No relatives. Wife and sons are gone.
Bad luck!

05:14.355 --> 05:15.732
Please give me some tip.

05:15.939 --> 05:18.819
You jinx!

05:18.944 --> 05:20.487
Come here! I hit...
Tip!

05:20.653 --> 05:21.903
Yes. Master! 

05:22.531 --> 05:23.574
Are you sure?
 A beggar!

05:23.699 --> 05:24.615
Get the money and 
get out of here.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.951
Beggars are human beings,
 too.

05:28.076 --> 05:29.538
During this month 
you can eat here

05:29.704 --> 05:31.247
or have fun with prostitutes,
 I'll Pay!

05:31.415 --> 05:32.583
Will you pay?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.877
I do! I do!

05:36.170 --> 05:38.797
Sir! This way please.
Follow me please...

05:40.548 --> 05:42.216
Su-Sir!

05:43.759 --> 05:44.802
How are you?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.139
I have my name.
Don't call me procuress!

05:47.305 --> 05:48.639
It's better to be frank.

05:48.891 --> 05:49.850
Speaking of frankness?

05:50.016 --> 05:52.394
With the hat,
 you like mourning.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.687
Your Dad?

05:54.980 --> 05:57.232
It's interesting to 
say things this way.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.360
Mr. Chau ramps the 
defectors for me.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.572
His Majesty will bestow
a lot of fortune.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.451
Please say some thing good about me
to His Majesty.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.454
After the opera,
 please use the towel.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.834
Su-Sir is here!

06:16.709 --> 06:19.463
Su-Sir. Congratulations.
This way, please.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.713
Su-Sir.
 It's your lucky day. 

06:20.838 --> 06:22.007
Have fun. 

06:22.088 --> 06:24.134
We have some lovely girls
who'll cheer you up.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.343
Goldfish or wooden fish?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.137
Master!
 What do you mean?

06:27.346 --> 06:30.516
Stupid boy! You can look at goldfish,
but you can take wooden fish.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.809
Of course,
 I want wooden fish.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.269
Wooden fishes,
come to welcome our guests.

06:36.230 --> 06:40.108
It's your big day.
Just tell us which girl you like.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.444
They're all the same.
 I don't care.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.451
Su-Sir.
 What's wrong? 

06:51.161 --> 06:52.204
I was sacked!

06:52.370 --> 06:54.622
What? Who dares to do that?
I'll smack his mouth.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.084
She didn't sack me with her mouth,
but eyes.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.627
I've never seen
such a seducing expression.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.004
Who's she? 

07:02.254 --> 07:03.882
She's not a professional one.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.968
Are you interested?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.511
You should ask our 
nobleman first.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.927
How do you feel,
 my master? 

07:09.346 --> 07:12.098
Don't be so polite.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.809
Go on please.
 Mr. Chau!

07:14.600 --> 07:16.519
Thanks!
 I want the girl.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.189
Ru-Shun! Go down here to see
Mr. Chau.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.528
It's him who killed our Dad!

07:25.821 --> 07:27.153
I know!
 Hold on! Go!

07:27.990 --> 07:30.199
Mr. Chau.
 It's Ru-Shun!

07:32.911 --> 07:36.372
It's Ru-Shun.
 Nice to meet you.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.254
Really a beauty!

07:43.963 --> 07:46.757
Mr. Chau.
 So tonight...

07:46.841 --> 07:48.093
It's a one hundred 
thousand bill.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.887
She'll serve our 
master tonight!

07:51.180 --> 07:52.389
Sorry!
 Not available for you.

07:52.598 --> 07:56.266
Sorry! I hope you don't mind,
 gentlemen.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.812
Calm down!
 Listen to me!

08:00.062 --> 08:02.524
Anyone who can pay 
more than the bill,

08:02.649 --> 08:05.610
you'll get the chance to be served
by Ru-Shun.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.237
Do you think it's fair?

08:07.403 --> 08:09.072
He really dares to spend money.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.867
Bill is nothing.

08:13.492 --> 08:17.581
I've got an valuable 
Din-Fon Pearl.

08:20.665 --> 08:22.293
I prefer pearls.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.757
Mr. Chau!
 I am room...

08:27.632 --> 08:29.384
Hi! Do you think the pearl
is worth that bill?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.135
You think one hundred thousand dollars
is not enough?

08:32.346 --> 08:35.474
I love money.
 But I don't like you.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.269
Frankly speaking,
I really like her very much.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.105
Su-Sir!
 Never mind.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.942
Maybe that's because my hairstyle
doesn't fit my hat.

08:45.106 --> 08:47.653
So Ru-Shun doesn't like me.
It's my fault.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.153
Exactly!

08:49.363 --> 08:51.490
Su-Sir.
 Don't worry!

08:51.740 --> 08:54.158
Procuress.
I have to rely on you tonight.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.620
None of my business.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.206
You've gone too far!

09:09.423 --> 09:11.384
Mantis fist?
 Not bad!

09:11.552 --> 09:12.427
Music. 

09:19.768 --> 09:20.644
Let's go!

09:21.894 --> 09:23.230
Beak ofthe crane!
 Craw of the tiger!

09:28.067 --> 09:29.695
How can a mantis beat a tiger,

09:29.945 --> 09:31.196
and a crane?

09:31.947 --> 09:33.407
I can do the combination of tiger
and crane fist.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.869
So let's try and see.

09:51.298 --> 09:53.719
You're defeated again.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.053
So,
 it's not the combination.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.682
It's the wings of a peacock!
No wonder that's weak!

10:06.148 --> 10:08.609
Change the shape and position.
Finally got something different.

10:10.317 --> 10:13.071
Young man.
 Be modest!

10:19.576 --> 10:21.330
General in Guangzhou.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.710
Whoever dares to abuse my son
will have to pay for that!

10:27.168 --> 10:28.043
Master! 

10:28.378 --> 10:29.546
Tsan! Don't be afraid.
 Who insulted you?

10:29.754 --> 10:30.589
Me!

10:31.548 --> 10:32.298
What?
 Who was insulted by you?

10:32.548 --> 10:34.426
Is he rich?
 Qualified or not??

10:34.591 --> 10:35.927
Them!
Who?

10:36.134 --> 10:37.385
You'll know when you see them.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.724
The king of iron hat!

10:43.519 --> 10:44.476
Take it! 

10:44.644 --> 10:45.812
Tsan!
 Forgive him

10:45.979 --> 10:46.937
since he gives you this present.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.273
Give it to the ladies here.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.149
Master...

10:49.316 --> 10:51.274
It's reads, "The king of iron hat:
Tseng-Ko-Lin-Ching."

11:01.576 --> 11:04.038
How dare you try to get this?
 Catch him!

11:04.163 --> 11:04.956
Wait!

11:05.541 --> 11:09.086
According to our law, the official
shouldn't visit prostitutes.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.339
You're here.
You won't have chance to get rid of it.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.715
How about you?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.173
Does he mean me?
Yes.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.259
It's me!
 I'm here for...

11:17.469 --> 11:18.220
To catch...
Catch you!

11:18.427 --> 11:19.803
Him!
Catch him!

11:20.178 --> 11:21.431
I'm the general of Guangzhou.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.932
I'll get all of you,
 the black sheep!

11:24.057 --> 11:25.433
And...
And what?

11:25.561 --> 11:26.519
Say!

11:27.019 --> 11:30.065
It's the anniversary 
of the ancestor,

11:30.190 --> 11:33.277
you've to be punished!

11:33.402 --> 11:35.070
Yes! Kill him!

11:39.908 --> 11:41.076
According to the law,

11:41.243 --> 11:43.201
people who has no 
braid has to die.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.120
So you...

11:47.706 --> 11:49.960
Do you still want to see?
 I've got more.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.296
Don't talk shit with him!
 Catch him!

11:52.546 --> 11:54.464
OK!
 Don't play anymore!

11:54.715 --> 11:56.966
General Su, we do have good time.
Forget about it.

11:57.048 --> 11:58.427
I didn't have anyjoy yet!

11:59.259 --> 12:02.139
Your Royalty, it's unfortunate
to have the rascals here.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.389
I'm sorry!

12:03.557 --> 12:05.807
None of your business.
 Go!

12:08.476 --> 12:11.523
We dare not provoke him.
 Let's stop!

12:12.441 --> 12:13.567
OK! Yes.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.195
Don't make a mountain 
out of a molehill.

12:18.778 --> 12:21.200
Master!
 Your hat!

12:27.788 --> 12:28.831
He's really a master!

12:37.591 --> 12:40.469
Uncle Mo, we've put poison
in the wine and food.

12:40.552 --> 12:44.389
Chau assassinated our leader

12:44.514 --> 12:46.057
and the generals 
of Tai-Ping Empire,

12:46.517 --> 12:48.183
even want to impute us.

12:48.519 --> 12:51.897
So all the people in underworld
look down on us.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.024
They think we betray them.

12:54.481 --> 12:56.735
Revenge can be taken today.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.571
His born strength 
is really powerful.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.865
Don't start to fight
unless he's tricked.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.533
We can't beat him.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.284
I'll ask him to be near the bed.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.913
Senior,
 someone is coming.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.374
Get ready!

13:18.630 --> 13:20.216
Ru-Shun,
 nice to meet you again.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.219
Why are you here?
 Where's Chau?.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.596
Su-Sir smashed his pearl,'

13:24.763 --> 13:26.807
I just took it with water.

13:27.514 --> 13:29.268
Don't be fooled by his look.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.311
Actually he's funny.

13:31.726 --> 13:32.604
But...

13:32.769 --> 13:35.023
No but!
 Once I have the bill,

13:35.190 --> 13:36.649
it's hard to get 
it out of my pocket.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.442
Actually.
 Su-Sir... 

13:38.652 --> 13:41.113
Shut up!
 Get out of here.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.529
Yes, Sir!

13:42.739 --> 13:44.115
Miss.
Don't be too critical.

13:49.327 --> 13:50.370
Who's he?

13:50.831 --> 13:51.706
I've no idea!

13:51.956 --> 13:56.378
Miss. First,
 I like you very much.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.379
Bad news for me. 

13:59.840 --> 14:01.508
I know you'll say so.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.969
Cut it short! I would like
to pay 100 pearls,

14:04.177 --> 14:06.928
just to have you be 
my company tonight.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.974
I don't want to talk to you.
 Get out!

14:10.893 --> 14:13.979
Myjudgment is right!
 I'll drink first.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.437
You can't drink!

14:21.820 --> 14:23.572
I'm too surprised!

14:24.990 --> 14:26.158
Miss!
Let me go!!

14:28.619 --> 14:29.784
You know martial arts?

14:30.702 --> 14:32.538
No! I can't.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.582
Please let me go!

14:35.792 --> 14:38.253
No one have ever treated me this way
except you.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.754
I'm in love with you.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.466
What?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.677
I said I love you.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.596
Are you crazy?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.225
No!
 I'm serious!

14:53.225 --> 14:54.269
You nuts! 

14:55.562 --> 14:56.730
I can't understand you.

14:59.105 --> 15:00.859
Someone is hiding here.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.240
Great!
 I want a witness.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.407
Witness?
Yes.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.993
I'll swear in 
front of this sword.

15:10.244 --> 15:11.995
I'm serious.
 I want to marry her.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.163
I'll be struck by lightning
if I tell a lie.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.167
Sister!
 I'm happy for you.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.379
Do you think it's so easy
to be my husband?

15:21.586 --> 15:23.004
How can I be qualified?

15:24.633 --> 15:26.384
My husband must be the best.

15:26.591 --> 15:28.846
Beyond all the people except the King.
Can you make it?

15:29.888 --> 15:30.931
Let me think!

15:36.979 --> 15:37.937
OK! 

15:40.148 --> 15:43.317
Come to see me once 
you can make it.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.947
Well!
 We can engage first,

15:47.279 --> 15:49.825
because that's too easy for me.

15:50.615 --> 15:53.952
OK! Give me some time 
to think about it.

15:54.202 --> 15:58.456
No problem! I want for your reply
in the garden.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.922
Nuts!

16:25.527 --> 16:28.697
People not involved 
should get away now.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.615
Go now!

17:00.729 --> 17:01.897
Go now!

17:23.335 --> 17:26.086
Sir!
 The timing is perfect.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.298
It's safe so far in front of us.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.969
Great!

17:34.555 --> 17:35.471
Let's go!

17:47.482 --> 17:49.736
We're late.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.529
He has to be responsible.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.663
Sister!

18:00.913 --> 18:01.748
What's the matter?

18:01.999 --> 18:04.459
That nut is still there!
 Kill him!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.836
Forget about it!
 He didn't mean it.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.172
Let it be.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.351
You're telling 
me you're in love.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.894
What are you talking about?i

18:23.144 --> 18:26.396
I won't consider about this
if Chau is alive.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.772
Not to mention his look.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.152
Chau's martial arts is superior.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.363
Mo said we won't beat him
ifwe can't use Shan Long Eighteen fist.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.074
So we'll never be 
able to get married.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.035
Let's go!
 Don't be nonsense!

18:55.928 --> 18:58.180
Who are you?
How dare you frighten me here?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.767
Su-Sir.
 It's me!

19:03.977 --> 19:05.729
Procuress?
Yes.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.605
What's wrong with your breast?

19:07.730 --> 19:10.106
It's too early.
 It's still sleeping.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.402
You're lucky not to be killed
by the fist.

19:12.567 --> 19:14.238
Don't run around next time
without make-up!

19:14.363 --> 19:15.529
Yes!

19:15.904 --> 19:19.785
Ru-Shun is gone!

19:20.410 --> 19:21.286
Gone?

19:25.457 --> 19:27.209
Where's she?

19:27.709 --> 19:31.380
I heard she went to the capital.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.048
Capital?

19:33.588 --> 19:42.057
"We sacrificed ourselves
for the country.

19:42.182 --> 19:46.228
Go there! Come here!
 Squeeze!"

19:46.519 --> 19:49.605
Dad! I decided to join
the test in the capital.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.483
Tsan. I've been waiting for this word
for 25 years.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.318
You should do this 
for our family.

19:55.443 --> 19:56.278
Don't misunderstand me!r

19:56.444 --> 19:58.198
I do this only for a woman.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.406
Hero!

19:59.740 --> 20:01.992
Die for a woman,
 work hard for a woman.

20:02.160 --> 20:02.993
Who's the girl?

20:03.201 --> 20:05.453
I-Hong House Gold 
Metal Lady Ru-Shun.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.707
Prostitute?

20:07.958 --> 20:09.125
Any thing wrong?

20:09.710 --> 20:12.377
Your taste is absolutely unique.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.757
I admire you!
Let me go to the capital with you.

20:15.883 --> 20:18.049
Sir! I am here!
 What happened?

20:18.259 --> 20:20.470
We all are moving
ifyoung master will join the test.

20:22.556 --> 20:23.972
OK!
 Don't chase!

20:24.097 --> 20:26.268
Don't take this.
 We'll have more there.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.730
You jerk!
 Take care!

20:29.855 --> 20:32.316
I'll hit you on the hips
if you break it.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.692
Take it easy.

20:34.817 --> 20:35.861
Dad! Morning.
Morning!

20:36.067 --> 20:37.694
Do you really move all of these things?
Sure!

20:37.863 --> 20:39.404
You should at least
give me some clothes.

20:39.573 --> 20:42.365
What are you afraid of?
I'm not small!

20:43.951 --> 20:46.203
Have you got bigger 
brother than mine?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.373
Don't look down on me!

20:48.538 --> 20:51.375
Who will be kind enough
to lend me pants?

20:52.836 --> 20:55.297
Hi. Why are you still here?
Move it away.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.798
The house is so big, how much time
does it take to move everything?

20:57.923 --> 20:59.799
Get ready!

21:00.009 --> 21:06.473
Listen to 3 then you start moving.
Three, two, one. Push!

21:07.267 --> 21:10.019
Be careful!
 Tie it up!

21:10.229 --> 21:11.895
Master,
 are we moving the tree?

21:12.105 --> 21:14.942
Sure.
Otherwise, you won't have li-chi there.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.777
Push it there!

21:17.736 --> 21:22.405
Be careful!
Take care of my li-chi!

21:22.574 --> 21:23.325
Really jerk!

21:23.951 --> 21:26.368
Chau did help me 
a lot in Guangxi.

21:26.537 --> 21:30.582
He exterminated the rebels. 

21:30.707 --> 21:33.166
So I take him here 
to see Your Majesty.

21:34.461 --> 21:38.882
Good!
I grant you to be the imperial censor.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.345
Render your service 
for Ching Dynasty.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.761
It's my honor,
 Your Majesty.

21:45.011 --> 21:48.057
Your Majesty,
Mr. Chau's exotic magic is excellent.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.394
Why notjust let him 
show Your Majesty?

21:51.603 --> 21:52.644
Exotic magic?

21:54.730 --> 21:57.482
Mr. Chau,
 please show His Majesty.

21:57.732 --> 21:58.567
Yes.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.701
What's a big deal?
Yes!

24:24.256 --> 24:26.798
I'm sorry
to have Your Majesty been frightened.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.178
I only wish if she's real.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.471
Hurry!
 Hurry up!

24:32.890 --> 24:35.432
What's wrong?

24:35.851 --> 24:37.394
Go inside!

24:41.146 --> 24:43.025
You too! Hurry!
 To the back.

24:45.402 --> 24:46.361
Young Master,
 it's ready!

24:47.237 --> 24:50.699
Stand still.
 Don't move!!

24:55.412 --> 24:57.748
Smell so good.
 You're Peau-Shang.

24:58.582 --> 25:00.540
You're so great!
 I love you!

25:01.625 --> 25:02.586
Come closer!

25:03.670 --> 25:05.923
So big?
 Must be Small!

25:07.088 --> 25:08.842
Master!
 Don't describe me like that!

25:09.049 --> 25:09.968
I'm telling the truth!

25:12.346 --> 25:15.472
A pregnant woman? I'm not stupid!
You must be dad!

25:16.557 --> 25:18.934
No way!
 You guessed it again!

25:19.353 --> 25:21.895
Smart!
I want to play more trick with you.

25:22.314 --> 25:23.772
Marvelous!

25:25.400 --> 25:27.943
OK! Young Master
will have the test tomorrow.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.903
Don't play too long.
 Out...

25:30.864 --> 25:32.824
Tsan!
Are you ready for

25:32.990 --> 25:34.115
tomorrow's exam?

25:34.326 --> 25:36.662
Ready for what? I'll pass!
Can't you see?

25:37.246 --> 25:41.289
I know!
 I have confidence to you.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.669
Tsan!
 He's Uncle Jeng.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.296
Say hello to Uncle Jeng, he is the
person in charge of the exam. tomorrow.

25:46.755 --> 25:49.007
Hi! Uncle Jeng.

25:51.468 --> 25:52.928
Look! You look!

25:53.178 --> 25:55.721
Doesn't my son look 
like top candidate.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.891
It depends!

25:58.723 --> 26:00.853
The test-paper you gave me...

26:01.019 --> 26:03.438
is being answered by my friend.
Will you correct it?

26:03.939 --> 26:05.605
No problem with it!

26:05.772 --> 26:07.232
As for archery,
 galloping,

26:07.401 --> 26:08.861
weight-lifting,
 wrestling and weaponry,

26:09.027 --> 26:10.153
he has to depend on himself.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.699
Don't worry!
 My son is an expert.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.741
Can you reduce the amount
ofthe million dollars?

26:16.951 --> 26:19.327
We're good friends.
But business is business.

26:26.086 --> 26:30.173
Flying wild geese deployment. The
horses will hold up the center troop.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.634
The horses are the wings.
Troops with guns are the back.

27:03.038 --> 27:07.501
Please enter the exam hall.

27:59.846 --> 28:00.806
I can't held it! 

28:03.598 --> 28:06.644
I want to hide my ability.
 Shame on you?

28:30.919 --> 28:35.589
Wow! Perfect!

28:42.181 --> 28:43.597
Excellent!

28:43.891 --> 28:45.932
See!
 He is perfect too!

29:56.461 --> 29:59.214
Now begins the championship of
Martial Arts.

29:59.967 --> 30:03.595
We have two competitors today:
Botaroto form Mongolia.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.808
vs. Su-Cha-Ha-Ar-Tsan 
from Guangdong.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.064
Only three minutes!

30:14.271 --> 30:17.232
Tsan: 1 to 10!
 Botaroto: 1 to 1!

30:18.108 --> 30:21.028
Are you sure?
How come the difference is so big?

30:21.363 --> 30:23.740
One is 1 to 10!
 And the other is 1 to 1!

30:23.990 --> 30:25.740
This is an insult to Tsan!o

30:25.909 --> 30:29.578
Well, he gave up in 
the weight-lifting.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.582
Look! 

30:31.832 --> 30:35.750
Botaroto got perfect score
in everything.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.922
This is the competition 
of martial arts!

30:39.047 --> 30:40.714
Being strong and muscular
isn't enough to win!

30:40.798 --> 30:41.842
You can't judge it like this.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.259
This mister knows 
how to analyze.

30:45.135 --> 30:48.307
I found this ratio 
to be very strange.

30:48.891 --> 30:52.269
Botaroto is handsome 
and muscular,

30:52.434 --> 30:54.980
But he sweats too much.a

30:55.270 --> 30:57.230
Maybe he isn't that good.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.275
Really?

30:58.817 --> 31:00.442
Tsan is completely different.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.694
How about him?
Well, he seems to be sloppy,

31:03.028 --> 31:05.449
but he got into the final competition!
He'll set his heart on it!

31:05.615 --> 31:06.865
"Heart"?
 What's that?

31:07.034 --> 31:10.202
English!
 "Heart" means energy!

31:10.702 --> 31:12.579
So I'll bet on him!

31:12.954 --> 31:14.915
Yeah?
 How much do you have?

31:15.165 --> 31:16.416
800,000!

31:16.541 --> 31:19.127
That's too little.
 How about 2 million?

31:19.630 --> 31:21.507
How come you have
so much faith in him now?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.592
According to your analysis,

31:23.717 --> 31:25.675
I feel Tsan is winning for sure!

31:25.884 --> 31:27.804
Right!
 Come here!

31:29.096 --> 31:31.848
I'll add another 
2 million to Tsan.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.644
Bravo!

31:34.644 --> 31:35.894
Why don't you bet on him?

31:36.230 --> 31:38.480
Me?
 Tsan is my son!

31:39.816 --> 31:42.778
Oh, on!
I forgot the most important thing!

31:43.068 --> 31:43.903
What is it?

31:44.194 --> 31:45.028
The breed!?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.865
The judges are here!

31:51.368 --> 31:52.827
Isn't that Old Jeng?

31:57.040 --> 31:57.960
Please sit down!

32:00.546 --> 32:01.672
Tseng-Ko-Lin-Ching!

32:02.256 --> 32:03.213
What's wrong?

32:04.214 --> 32:06.675
He's Botaroto's uncle!

32:09.054 --> 32:09.886
Ready, go!

32:14.432 --> 32:15.477
Go...

32:47.549 --> 32:50.095
Target!
 Two extra points will be added!

32:50.345 --> 32:51.721
Logically, yes!

32:54.848 --> 32:58.310
Tsan's target has no arrow!
Botaroto won!

33:04.526 --> 33:07.068
What's going on?
 Are you nearsighted?

33:11.281 --> 33:13.617
Competitors!
Please get ready for the next game!

33:16.371 --> 33:17.247
Mr. Chau!

33:21.210 --> 33:23.961
Keep this set of mini-arrows.
You might need it.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.757
The second run begins!

33:56.076 --> 33:57.327
They even cheat on weapons!

33:57.827 --> 34:00.874
This is too nasty!
Give me back the money!

34:24.565 --> 34:25.690
We finally got it even.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.483
Did you throw your ticket away?

34:27.733 --> 34:28.777
Not yet.

34:41.248 --> 34:42.498
Are you sure?

35:41.599 --> 35:43.059
Won't you give up?
 Go ahead!

35:49.023 --> 35:50.900
Let's start again. I'll give you
a handicap to make it fair.

35:51.025 --> 35:52.193
So don't say that it's unfair.

36:02.788 --> 36:04.623
How can you win
with nasty gestures like this?

36:04.789 --> 36:06.123
Did you get enough sleep?
Boy!

36:06.875 --> 36:08.543
Great!
He won!

36:09.001 --> 36:10.335
Have some tea!!

36:10.710 --> 36:11.672
All the best!!

36:12.005 --> 36:14.257
There's nothing on my back!

36:14.507 --> 36:15.925
No!
 That's English! 

36:16.175 --> 36:17.219
English?

36:17.760 --> 36:19.221
Secret weapons are 
permitted to be used.

36:19.471 --> 36:22.724
Tsan, fell offfirst!
 So Botaroto won!

36:26.643 --> 36:29.606
Damn you,
Old Jeng! You cheated my money!

36:29.856 --> 36:32.192
I'll beat you next 
time I see you!

36:32.525 --> 36:33.985
No!
 You won't see him anymore!y

36:34.152 --> 36:34.902
Why?

36:35.027 --> 36:36.780
I'll kill him now!
I don't have 2 million to lose!

36:38.739 --> 36:39.782
I was joking! 

36:40.032 --> 36:40.992
Shameless!

36:41.367 --> 36:45.496
Botaroto won 2 games out of 3.
He's the champion!

36:45.956 --> 36:48.125
I protest!
 I am the winner!.

37:05.056 --> 37:05.893
Any disagreement? 

37:06.309 --> 37:09.771
The arrow has.
..poison!

37:11.690 --> 37:13.650
He died just on time!

37:16.652 --> 37:18.697
He owns that poisonous arrow!

37:18.905 --> 37:21.742
He's dead!
So my son becomes to be the champion!

37:21.949 --> 37:22.701
Then I'm rich! 

37:22.867 --> 37:23.619
Right! Exactly!

37:23.994 --> 37:25.161
You!t

37:32.503 --> 37:34.463
My son!
The whole family is proud of him!

37:34.880 --> 37:37.715
Smart! Clever!

37:38.550 --> 37:40.719
His Majesty wants 
to give the prize.

37:43.764 --> 37:44.556
Fine!

37:46.391 --> 37:47.726
The champion is here!

37:47.976 --> 37:52.021
I'd like to ask 
you some questions:

37:52.231 --> 37:54.565
who encouraged you to achieve
this great success!

37:54.650 --> 37:55.817
Miss Ru-Shun!

37:56.860 --> 37:58.027
Who is Miss Ru-Shun?

37:58.195 --> 37:59.737
His mother? 

38:04.242 --> 38:06.994
Long live the Emperor!

38:07.286 --> 38:09.164
You may stand up!
Thanks, Your Majesty!

38:10.831 --> 38:13.585
Tseng!
 Who's the Champion?

38:15.670 --> 38:18.632
Tsan,
 from Guangdong.

38:21.635 --> 38:23.679
I'm Tsan,
 Your Majesty!

38:26.181 --> 38:28.056
Your Majesty,
may I report you something?

38:30.518 --> 38:31.478
Yes. 

38:33.063 --> 38:35.315
Tsan is illiterate.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.943
I'm sure he cheated 
in the writing exam.

38:42.447 --> 38:44.074
Bring me the pen and paper!
Yes.i

38:49.288 --> 38:52.623
Tsan,
 write your name immediately!

38:53.958 --> 38:58.380
He knows how to write his name!

39:11.268 --> 39:12.143
I don't know how!

39:14.021 --> 39:16.773
So you cheated!
 Execute him!

39:17.523 --> 39:18.567
No! Don't!

39:20.693 --> 39:23.112
Your Majesty,
I'm the one who cheated, not him!

39:23.237 --> 39:25.199
Punish me instead!
No, I'm the one who should die.

39:25.407 --> 39:27.074
Sorry, dad.
 I can't even write my name.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.492
It's OK.
 We're exposed!

39:28.784 --> 39:30.244
Kill me, Your Majesty!
No! Kill me!

39:30.494 --> 39:32.623
It should be me!
I'm easier to get killed!

39:32.748 --> 39:35.000
Shut up!
 You have no right to decide!

39:35.333 --> 39:39.085
Both ofyou are guilty.
How should they be punished?

39:40.213 --> 39:43.382
Where's the law-maker?

39:43.592 --> 39:44.842
I'm here!

39:49.181 --> 39:50.516
He's the law-maker?

39:50.849 --> 39:54.686
Both of them deserve 
capital punishment.

39:56.563 --> 40:00.900
Their ancestors're loyal to the emperor.
They have to turn in their property.

40:01.235 --> 40:04.070
Have you ever executed laws?

40:04.402 --> 40:06.782
No! I haven't gone to any military camp
for seven years.

40:07.949 --> 40:10.327
So you haven't made
any misjudgment yet!

40:11.869 --> 40:15.123
According to the old rules, they
only have to turn in all their property.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.545
That's it?
 Are you sure?

40:21.045 --> 40:25.007
Yes,
 I follow the record we keep.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.135
Could I add one more punishment?

40:28.719 --> 40:31.389
Of course,
 Your Majesty.

40:31.681 --> 40:34.518
OK. Both of you have to be beggars
for the rest of your life.

40:34.726 --> 40:37.271
Tseng!
 Why didn't you expose them?

40:37.478 --> 40:38.730
I'm glad we have Chau here.

40:39.021 --> 40:41.775
You'll be rewarded.

40:47.655 --> 40:50.199
That represents 
my ancestors' soul!

40:51.451 --> 40:53.911
Hey! That's incense.
 You won't need it.

41:00.335 --> 41:09.302
"It's easy to fall in love."

41:09.552 --> 41:10.721
Young Master. 

41:11.637 --> 41:15.099
You should learn 
how to write now.

41:18.228 --> 41:26.195
"It's bitter when 
you miss someone..."

41:28.739 --> 41:31.782
Teacher!
 I'll learn it!i

41:32.576 --> 41:36.538
"I regret..."

41:37.831 --> 41:40.626
Master,
 I'll raise the turtle.

41:40.833 --> 41:41.751
I'm sorry,
 Master! 

41:41.918 --> 41:42.960
We've been together for so long,

41:43.128 --> 41:44.378
but we never get pregnant. 

41:44.588 --> 41:47.632
It's because I 
didn't try my best.

41:47.715 --> 41:48.675
If I try my best,

41:48.759 --> 41:50.427
I could have lots of sons
if I wanted to!

41:50.552 --> 41:53.096
I think having Tsan is enough.I

41:54.222 --> 41:55.599
How come you're still here?
 Get lost!

41:55.891 --> 41:58.059
We'll leave now,
 Master!?

41:58.184 --> 41:59.228
Go away!

42:01.980 --> 42:03.065
Relieve my burden!

42:03.606 --> 42:05.483
Happy and free!

42:07.610 --> 42:09.487
Happy...

42:09.987 --> 42:11.739
Please come in!

42:14.284 --> 42:16.119
Why are they still so happy?

42:16.244 --> 42:17.204
It's none your business.

42:19.873 --> 42:22.000
Please come in!
Welcome!

42:23.001 --> 42:26.045
All our property are gone!
I want to cry.

42:26.255 --> 42:28.797
Try to bear it!
 Keep smiling!

42:30.592 --> 42:34.262
Did you keep some 
money secretly?

42:34.429 --> 42:35.472
No, and you? 

42:35.764 --> 42:37.014
I forgot!

42:39.309 --> 42:42.478
Oh, no!
 We're really broke!

42:44.856 --> 42:49.402
Merciful gentlemen!
 Please pity me!

42:49.610 --> 42:52.155
Doesn't he look 
like your father?

42:52.530 --> 42:53.864
You mean the one who's singing?

42:54.074 --> 42:55.951
No,
 the one who gave money.

42:56.242 --> 42:58.077
Wow!
 He's even more disgusting.

42:58.327 --> 43:01.081
Not bad!
We have different points of view.

43:02.039 --> 43:03.375
It's all my fault.

43:03.583 --> 43:05.376
I used to call you 
"Iittle beggar".

43:05.543 --> 43:06.585
Now we're really begging.

43:06.753 --> 43:08.672
Emperors' words are not forever.

43:08.838 --> 43:10.297
We won't be begging 
for too long.

43:10.507 --> 43:12.259
Look at me and my martial art,

43:12.467 --> 43:14.219
not even God will 
let me be beggar.

43:14.344 --> 43:15.179
You could be right!

43:15.219 --> 43:16.679
Do I look like a beggar?
No!

43:17.014 --> 43:19.349
Little beggar and old beggar,
get something to eat.

43:21.476 --> 43:23.436
You took us for beggars?

43:23.768 --> 43:25.146
Get lost!

43:25.688 --> 43:27.648
I can't believe this.
Let's get something to eat.

43:30.943 --> 43:32.987
Tsan,
 we're full and free. 

43:33.155 --> 43:34.197
I'll go sit over there.

43:34.447 --> 43:35.699
I'll try to get something
for tonight's dinner.

43:35.782 --> 43:37.367
Don't take begging 
too seriously.

43:37.617 --> 43:40.286
Dad.
 No need to beg.

43:40.454 --> 43:41.371
How are we going to 
support ourselves?

43:41.538 --> 43:42.581
Ask for the money!

43:42.706 --> 43:44.373
Hey! Buddy,
 what's your name?

43:45.291 --> 43:46.043
Niou, Ta-Tsun!

43:46.210 --> 43:47.251
Do you have some money?

43:47.460 --> 43:48.295
Yes.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.545
Let me have it.
Sure!

43:54.342 --> 43:55.092
Thanks!

43:55.844 --> 43:57.221
Why should I give you the money?

43:57.679 --> 43:58.847
You don't have to ask!

43:58.972 --> 44:00.264
But I should know!

44:00.349 --> 44:02.518
That makes no difference.
 Just give it!

44:02.684 --> 44:04.436
No!
 I have to find out first.

44:06.521 --> 44:08.398
Just give me the money!

44:08.481 --> 44:09.565
You're robbing me!

44:09.650 --> 44:11.735
Help! Robbers! 

44:11.860 --> 44:13.820
It's not robbing.
 We're begging!

44:14.362 --> 44:17.532
You tried to cheat me!

44:17.739 --> 44:20.494
I'm not a stupid pig!
 I'm very smart!

44:20.661 --> 44:23.579
It's getting cold,
 and I'm starving.

44:23.746 --> 44:25.123
Do you know what to do now?

44:25.289 --> 44:26.166
Yes!

44:26.333 --> 44:29.293
My friend's aunt's sister
is in the town now.

44:30.253 --> 44:32.213
He told me that the 
girl is fond of you. 

44:32.422 --> 44:33.882
Really?
Yes!

44:34.297 --> 44:36.217
Ifyou're willing to be friendly
with him,

44:36.425 --> 44:38.679
he'll help us to 
go to Guangdong.

44:39.012 --> 44:40.972
But you'll have to 
sacrifice a little.

44:41.181 --> 44:42.641
What do you say?

44:43.181 --> 44:45.018
I'll do anything for the family.

44:45.184 --> 44:46.561
I'm sorry this is hard for you..

44:46.643 --> 44:47.896
It's OK.
 Let's go to see him!

44:47.980 --> 44:49.146
I've arranged 
everything for you.

44:49.356 --> 44:51.983
Do you see the one in red
under that lantern?

44:57.989 --> 45:01.159
Ghost! 

45:03.996 --> 45:05.956
Is it OK?
No problem!

45:06.164 --> 45:07.291
You'll go first,
 I'll back-up?

45:20.554 --> 45:23.431
Be careful!

45:23.556 --> 45:25.726
I'm take care of myself!

45:25.851 --> 45:27.393
Have some soup!

45:27.518 --> 45:28.393
Yeah...

45:30.105 --> 45:32.773
Go away!

45:32.940 --> 45:34.318
No commercial 
activities' allowed!

45:37.820 --> 45:40.864
We need money to go home.

45:41.074 --> 45:43.619
Please don't push us too hard.

45:45.579 --> 45:46.829
The Emperor ordereds

45:46.996 --> 45:49.373
you two to be begging
for the rest ofyour life.

45:49.833 --> 45:53.795
And I must execute the law.

45:53.960 --> 45:54.670
Yes!

45:54.755 --> 45:56.130
Take away everything!
Yes!

46:00.135 --> 46:02.387
I'm not able to move it!

46:02.846 --> 46:05.097
Go help him! 

46:05.264 --> 46:07.099
Yes!

46:08.434 --> 46:09.478
Dad,
 what's the matter with you?

46:09.603 --> 46:10.896
Still cannot move it!
Let me do it!

46:11.063 --> 46:12.313
You did it on purpose!

46:13.106 --> 46:14.858
I let you escape last time.

46:15.150 --> 46:16.693
But you won't be 
that lucky today!

46:20.447 --> 46:21.697
This man is good in martial art.

46:21.907 --> 46:24.451
I must beat him hard 
at the beginning!

46:24.659 --> 46:26.202
I can't let him fight back.

46:46.389 --> 46:50.268
Tsan... 

46:51.936 --> 46:53.688
All your tendons are 
disconnected now.

46:53.896 --> 46:55.148
I just broke them.

46:55.356 --> 46:57.525
You're boneless now.

46:59.570 --> 47:02.114
You won't be able to practise
martial art anymore.

47:02.572 --> 47:05.617
But you can be a beggar.

47:06.159 --> 47:07.411
Behave yourself! 

47:09.204 --> 47:12.583
Go away...

47:21.047 --> 47:24.427
Don't be afraid.
 It's alright...

47:25.219 --> 47:31.393
Tsan! Don't be afraid.
 It's OK!.

47:32.186 --> 47:35.938
The day we went 
to the competition,

47:36.106 --> 47:37.773
we met the judge.

47:38.025 --> 47:39.860
Wow!
 Guess who was it?

47:40.193 --> 47:42.612
Tseng!
 That bastard!

47:43.070 --> 47:45.614
I knew he hated us!

47:45.864 --> 47:48.619
I'm still mad with 
this whole thing!

47:48.784 --> 47:52.164
Have some cigarette!

47:52.246 --> 47:53.916
Keep telling...

47:54.041 --> 47:55.416
That bastard!.

47:55.583 --> 47:59.338
We let him escaped once,

47:59.545 --> 48:01.297
and we never expected

48:01.547 --> 48:03.300
he would frame us!

48:03.509 --> 48:05.469
He cheated on weapons.

48:05.635 --> 48:08.514
But my son is a real hero.

48:08.679 --> 48:11.056
I'm looking for a capable
and strong man to be my husband.

48:11.224 --> 48:15.268
Do you think 
you'll be qualified?

48:15.393 --> 48:16.230
Yes!

48:16.396 --> 48:19.983
Come to me when you're able to.

48:21.943 --> 48:23.612
We can arrange the 
wedding date now.

48:23.737 --> 48:26.114
Because winning the championship
is too easy for me.

48:30.744 --> 48:34.623
I won!

48:35.373 --> 48:36.708
Write down your name!

48:39.460 --> 48:40.503
I don't know how!

48:50.639 --> 48:53.016
Tsan!
 What's wrong?

48:56.311 --> 49:02.192
Nightmare again?
 Take it easy!

49:06.445 --> 49:09.532
You've rested two months,
and you can move your hands now.

49:09.992 --> 49:11.451
But that's not enough!

49:11.617 --> 49:13.954
Uncle!
Coming!

49:14.121 --> 49:16.998
I'll go beg something to eat.
Wait for me.

49:17.248 --> 49:19.793
I'll feed you the 
medicine later. 

49:20.126 --> 49:22.378
Dad!
 Are you going begging again?

49:22.670 --> 49:24.630
Of course,
 I'm good at it. 

49:24.797 --> 49:26.425
I can't let a 
champion like you...

49:28.802 --> 49:32.472
Tsan,
 it requires a lot of skills

49:32.639 --> 49:34.266
to be a good beggar.

49:35.099 --> 49:37.186
Opening your hand isn't enough.

49:37.561 --> 49:40.021
You must hold a bowl
that suits your identity.

49:40.146 --> 49:42.608
That's interesting to know.

49:43.150 --> 49:44.525
Hey!
 Let's move! 

49:46.027 --> 49:47.195
Coming!

49:47.362 --> 49:49.322
I must go now!

49:49.489 --> 49:52.242
Yes...
Do you think you're still the general?

50:09.842 --> 50:11.385
Please pity me!
No! Get lost!

50:11.552 --> 50:12.804
Go over there!

50:13.012 --> 50:15.264
Go away!
 Don't block my business.

50:18.309 --> 50:19.686
Tsan,
 I'm going out! 

50:31.489 --> 50:33.951
Thank you!

50:40.623 --> 50:42.583
Thank you!

50:49.297 --> 50:50.759
Don't be so stingy!

50:50.925 --> 50:51.885
Can't you write it yourself?

50:52.094 --> 50:54.762
I only wanted to borrow your place
for a while!

50:55.304 --> 50:56.139
I'm not a fool!

51:30.047 --> 51:33.467
Dad!
 What's wrong?

51:33.927 --> 51:37.514
I'm freezing!
 Tsan!

51:39.266 --> 51:42.686
Your body is burning hot!

51:43.518 --> 51:45.688
Are you sick?
No... 

51:47.315 --> 51:50.985
Are you hungry?
I'll go beg something today.

51:52.570 --> 51:54.822
Dad, please lie down.
I'll go begging today.

51:55.449 --> 51:56.699
You'll go begging?

51:57.074 --> 52:00.036
Don't worry!
 I can handle it.

52:00.286 --> 52:01.829
I'll get the money
and take you to the doctor.

52:20.474 --> 52:22.016
You just eat nothing.

52:22.184 --> 52:24.643
Eat! So you'll become 
strong like daddy.

52:27.146 --> 52:28.190
Come on!
 Finish your meal.

52:28.315 --> 52:29.608
I'm full!

52:29.775 --> 52:32.110
No, you must eat it.
Are you really full?

52:32.818 --> 52:34.862
OK.
 Let's go home!

52:35.489 --> 52:39.034
Eat!

52:42.161 --> 52:43.413
Kid!
What?

52:43.621 --> 52:44.873
Could you...
No!

53:02.766 --> 53:08.521
Merciful..
.gentlemen!

53:11.190 --> 53:15.777
Please pity me!n

53:18.030 --> 53:20.117
My dad is freezing to death!

53:22.159 --> 53:24.036
Do you want to take
these tiny pieces of coal?

53:24.246 --> 53:27.708
Thanks! Could I have 
some coins as well?

53:29.251 --> 53:31.503
It's you!
It's not me!

53:31.960 --> 53:34.505
It's him!
It's not him!

53:34.630 --> 53:36.592
It's Tsan!

53:37.885 --> 53:40.512
Wait a moment!

53:45.266 --> 53:47.226
Who are you looking for?

53:49.646 --> 53:51.106
Sorry, I mistook you 
for someone else.

53:51.440 --> 53:53.108
Go get him some bread.

53:53.275 --> 53:55.235
He's not Tsan!

53:56.737 --> 53:57.987
You look so much 
like a friend of mine.

53:58.237 --> 54:01.324
Come here
whenever you have nothing to eat.

54:01.574 --> 54:03.702
We have too much food.

54:04.827 --> 54:06.579
The bread is here.
Take it!

54:10.458 --> 54:11.835
Thank you!

54:14.630 --> 54:18.175
He became like this,
 because of you.

54:30.938 --> 54:31.855
Dad!

54:32.356 --> 54:33.315
What happened to me?

54:33.440 --> 54:35.692
Tsan!
 I was starving.

54:35.817 --> 54:38.987
So I took a bite of his bread.

54:39.195 --> 54:40.739
It's OK.
 I have bread for him.

54:40.947 --> 54:41.864
Don't be ridiculous!

54:42.074 --> 54:44.326
Why don't you let me cut your head off,
then give it back to you?

54:46.827 --> 54:48.288
Isn't this the 
champion of martial art?

54:49.789 --> 54:51.916
Is it really you?

54:53.001 --> 54:53.876
Almost!

54:54.001 --> 54:57.880
It's him!
 I must treat him!

54:58.047 --> 54:59.297
Thanks...

54:59.465 --> 55:01.717
Wait!
 I want to treat you!

55:03.302 --> 55:04.887
Treat me? 

55:05.054 --> 55:07.224
You want to invite us to dinner?

55:10.726 --> 55:11.768
Dog food!

55:12.563 --> 55:16.023
Eat it,
 and I'll release your father.

55:18.943 --> 55:19.987
It's real dog food.

55:20.570 --> 55:22.614
Finish it!

55:33.166 --> 55:36.253
Tsan! Don't eat it!
 This is an insult!

55:37.128 --> 55:38.880
I can bear this.

55:39.088 --> 55:41.757
I used to be a great general.

55:42.800 --> 55:43.594
What do you want?

55:43.802 --> 55:44.719
Stop beating!

55:44.887 --> 55:45.929
Attention!

55:53.103 --> 55:54.855
See! The champion of martial art
is eating dog food!

55:55.230 --> 55:57.690
Dad,
 it tastes good!

55:58.108 --> 55:58.942
Really?

55:59.525 --> 56:02.402
Let me try!

56:06.867 --> 56:08.034
It looks delicious!

56:12.956 --> 56:16.501
There's a slice of meat here!

56:16.751 --> 56:18.628
It's a chop!

56:28.054 --> 56:31.724
You're destined to be beggars.

56:33.768 --> 56:36.146
Finish it!
 Hurry!

56:37.313 --> 56:38.565
This is very delicious.

56:38.856 --> 56:40.608
Can I save a bite 
for midnight snack?

56:40.817 --> 56:44.070
You were born to be a beggar.

56:46.239 --> 56:48.867
Let's go celebrate now!

56:49.159 --> 56:51.036
Let's go!

56:54.956 --> 56:55.998
Mr. Su!

57:00.585 --> 57:01.630
You are...

57:02.255 --> 57:04.132
My father is the leader of the gang
of Beggars.

57:04.340 --> 57:06.385
Why don't you join us?

57:06.592 --> 57:08.554
Is it OK, Uncle Mo?
Sure!

57:08.762 --> 57:10.222
Are you beggars,
 too?

57:10.429 --> 57:11.264
Yes!

57:11.389 --> 57:13.349
Great!
 We're beggars,

57:13.599 --> 57:15.351
and it's nice to join
an organization for protection.

57:15.518 --> 57:17.061
Tsan!
 Where's the boy?

57:17.186 --> 57:18.438
Tsan!
 Where is he?

57:18.688 --> 57:22.233
Miss!
Both of us want to register! Tsan...

57:34.161 --> 57:36.831
Ru-Shun! Happy New Year!
Uncle Su! Happy New Year!

57:37.039 --> 57:38.708
Mr. Mo! Happy New Year!
Congratulations! 

57:39.041 --> 57:41.503
This is for you!
Thank you!

57:43.588 --> 57:46.340
These clothes are 
for you and Tsan.

57:46.967 --> 57:48.217
Put the things down!

57:49.969 --> 57:51.346
Do you have some change?
Yes!

57:51.471 --> 57:52.639
Bring it!

57:52.806 --> 57:53.639
What is it?

57:53.806 --> 57:57.268
New Year! You should give out
some lucky money.

57:57.476 --> 57:59.228
To your excellent health. 

57:59.313 --> 58:01.606
Young and beautiful forever!
Thanks!

58:01.690 --> 58:03.233
Mr. Mo,
 you can skip us!

58:03.400 --> 58:04.650
OK!
Where's Tsan?

58:04.818 --> 58:08.487
He fell asleep at 
the end of last year,

58:08.739 --> 58:10.199
and he hasn't wake up yet.

58:10.324 --> 58:12.409
Let him sleep.

58:13.367 --> 58:15.411
I'll prepare some snack for you.
Come...

58:15.621 --> 58:17.664
Let me help you!

58:19.291 --> 58:21.043
He's still sleeping?

58:22.668 --> 58:24.128
Dog meat can't be used
in formal banquet.

58:26.672 --> 58:27.925
Is everybody here?

58:28.925 --> 58:31.469
In order to fight Chau,
we must unite the gang of Beggars.

58:32.346 --> 58:34.972
We must elect a new leader
as soon as possible.

58:35.931 --> 58:37.476
Ru-Shun...

58:38.936 --> 58:41.771
We have to rely on you to fight
the three senior members.

58:42.481 --> 58:45.358
Mr. Mo,
 I'm not that sure.

58:45.733 --> 58:47.610
Not even you can beat them all.

58:47.735 --> 58:50.112
So don't expect too much
in becoming the leader.

58:51.697 --> 58:54.952
After eating this pill,
your strength will be increased.

58:55.409 --> 58:58.371
No! This is for curing
your internal wound.

58:58.539 --> 58:59.664
How can I take it?

58:59.831 --> 59:00.916
Don't worry!

59:01.123 --> 59:02.960
You can fight with my son
to practise martial art.

59:03.210 --> 59:04.878
He get the championship 
of martial art.

59:05.003 --> 59:06.547
He is! No!
 He was!

59:06.838 --> 59:08.297
Look at him!
 Sleeping all the time!

59:08.547 --> 59:10.467
Can he really fight?

59:10.634 --> 59:12.469
He's not even qualified 
to be a beggar!

59:12.719 --> 59:14.054
Hey!
 Don't be so frank!

59:15.179 --> 59:16.849
Don't speak so loudly!

59:25.190 --> 59:29.652
I ignore their comments!

59:30.862 --> 59:32.697
I have faith in you.

59:33.739 --> 59:35.576
Even you lost your strength,

59:36.367 --> 59:37.702
you had a very good basic.

59:37.952 --> 59:41.414
So as long as you try hard,
you'll succeed again.

59:41.581 --> 59:43.666
But I have no more strength!

59:43.833 --> 59:45.668
That's not true!
 Try to beat me!

59:49.463 --> 59:51.215
That was good!

59:51.425 --> 59:53.050
So,
 as I said...

59:53.342 --> 59:55.179
Stop wasting your energy!

59:55.344 --> 59:56.804
Let me sleep!

01:00:02.059 --> 01:00:02.893
Why did you lock the door?

01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:04.478
Alright,
 sleep now!

01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:22.371
Son! My son!
I tried my best to set this up,

01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:25.501
you must study hard!

01:00:47.146 --> 01:00:48.773
What are you doing up there?

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:51.275
You want me practise? 

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.487
Fine,
 Leave me the long stick!

01:00:54.695 --> 01:00:56.864
Sorry!
 Catch it!

01:01:04.914 --> 01:01:07.583
When one is chosen
to complete a mission,

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:13.005
he must reinforce 
his body and mine.

01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:22.306
"Life is a torture.
" You wrote it?

01:01:22.974 --> 01:01:27.813
What a bad handwriting!
 Erase it!

01:01:29.856 --> 01:01:31.525
Hey! Beggar?

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.443
Yeah!
Me, too!

01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.152
Congratulations!

01:01:35.695 --> 01:01:38.030
Anything to eat?
No!

01:01:38.532 --> 01:01:39.782
I'm glad I do!

01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:46.414
You look great!

01:01:46.539 --> 01:01:49.458
It's a shame
if you don't go begging like this!

01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:51.253
None ofyour business!

01:01:52.085 --> 01:01:55.257
You're too lazy to be a beggar.

01:01:57.467 --> 01:01:59.427
I used to be 
admired by everyone.

01:01:59.552 --> 01:02:00.929
But now!
 Look at me! 

01:02:01.471 --> 01:02:02.847
I'm the opposite.

01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:04.806
No one ever respected me.

01:02:05.016 --> 01:02:08.061
Listen to me!
 Don't walk away!

01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:09.813
I remember once,

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:14.483
in Guangdong,
he let me eat,

01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:16.945
sleep and play.
 This kind of people!

01:02:19.907 --> 01:02:21.574
Now I remember you!

01:02:22.074 --> 01:02:24.036
Damn!
 I remember you, too!

01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:26.788
Give me back my money!
 I need it!

01:02:26.954 --> 01:02:30.208
I wouldn't be here 
if I had money!

01:02:34.045 --> 01:02:35.172
Don't worry!

01:02:35.338 --> 01:02:38.217
I'll try my best to help you.

01:02:39.592 --> 01:02:41.052
Thank you!

01:02:42.179 --> 01:02:45.556
Not even money can 
buy what you lost.

01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:48.101
What did I lose?

01:02:48.184 --> 01:02:52.021
Dignity, self-confidence,
and the woman you love!

01:02:54.358 --> 01:02:55.525
Who are you?

01:02:55.775 --> 01:02:59.530
I'm cunning Ching,

01:02:59.695 --> 01:03:02.739
the highest-ranked member
among the gang of Beggars.

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:06.244
There's nothing wrong
with being a beggar.

01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:07.371
So free!

01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:10.164
What do you want really?

01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:11.708
I want to be reborn!

01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:13.585
Don't you like the 
way you are now?

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:16.045
No!
 I never did.

01:03:16.128 --> 01:03:18.507
That's why you became 
to be like this!

01:03:20.717 --> 01:03:23.094
Good!
 Very good!

01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:27.014
Speaking frankly,
after observing you for a while,

01:03:27.139 --> 01:03:29.393
I noticed that you're destined
to be a beggar!

01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:31.228
And so?

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:33.981
That means you must beg
for the rest ofyour life!

01:03:36.817 --> 01:03:39.068
I want to sleep for a while. 

01:03:39.318 --> 01:03:41.237
Don't worry.
You can turn it into a good career.

01:03:41.487 --> 01:03:44.032
I can predict that
you'll become the leader of all.

01:03:44.574 --> 01:03:46.909
The leader of all beggars? 

01:03:48.619 --> 01:03:49.579
Still a beggar!

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.418
I don't feel like talking
to you anymore.

01:03:55.668 --> 01:03:57.713
Please move to the side
and don't disturb me.

01:03:58.255 --> 01:03:59.590
Go away!
No!

01:03:59.797 --> 01:04:01.550
You mean sleeping.
I just want to be with you.

01:04:02.175 --> 01:04:03.552
You old gay!e

01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:10.016
I'll see you in the dream.

01:04:20.693 --> 01:04:23.362
Guardians get back 
to the position.

01:04:24.405 --> 01:04:27.451
Calm the dragon 
and tame the tiger.

01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:38.628
Tsan, you enjoyed all the luxury
and suffered all the tortures.

01:04:38.835 --> 01:04:40.172
And you finally became conscious
and understand yourself now.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.050
As the heir of
the 7th generation of Hong.

01:04:43.257 --> 01:04:44.717
I want to entitle you as
"the Guardian of Dream"

01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:48.304
and I'll teach you kung-fu.

01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:50.431
I hope you'll make 
the best use of it.

01:04:55.896 --> 01:04:59.858
Master!

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:07.449
"Life finally became hopeful!"

01:05:12.079 --> 01:05:15.666
Long live!

01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:20.920
The star of white goat is dropped.
And the order must be re-arranged.

01:05:21.295 --> 01:05:25.467
God gave me magic power,

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.177
so I can help the others.

01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:49.364
The emperor will 
go hunting tomorrow.

01:05:49.614 --> 01:05:52.536
I'll approach him by offering him
beautiful girls.

01:05:53.911 --> 01:05:57.248
Lynn, you might have to
sacrifice a little tomorrow.

01:05:57.623 --> 01:05:58.458
Yes!

01:05:59.835 --> 01:06:03.297
If I kill the emperor tomorrow,
all the kingdom will be mine!

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.257
I'll reward you all!

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:14.516
Long live!

01:06:14.974 --> 01:06:16.518
Master!
We'll talk later!

01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:48.759
Master!
Let's go!

01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:02.523
Master!

01:07:40.351 --> 01:07:41.518
Follow them!
Forget it!

01:07:42.813 --> 01:07:44.146
The emperor is about to leave.

01:07:45.106 --> 01:07:47.985
You kill that woman,
I want to offer you to the emperor!

01:07:53.614 --> 01:07:56.284
No one dares to come out now.

01:07:56.577 --> 01:07:58.829
Ask Mo to take out
that hitting dog stick.

01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:07.628
Where are Uncle 
Mo and my sister?

01:08:08.255 --> 01:08:09.422
I don't know.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.092
I just saw them talking...

01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:13.385
and walking out!

01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:16.680
They might have an affair?

01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:29.568
Now starts the election!

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:36.533
Uncle Mo!

01:08:36.742 --> 01:08:38.158
I thought you won't be back!

01:08:38.327 --> 01:08:39.703
Why?
 Where's my sister?

01:08:40.621 --> 01:08:42.581
She's arrested by Chau.

01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:44.707
We must send
a representative up on stage.

01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:52.216
Who can go?

01:09:05.895 --> 01:09:07.229
I'll go!
Uncle Mo!

01:09:07.648 --> 01:09:08.899
Let me try!

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:49.939
Tsan! You're too junior,
 get down!

01:09:51.314 --> 01:09:54.152
Ifyou have no better choice,
I'll accept this.

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:56.572
Tsan!
 This is not joking.

01:09:56.822 --> 01:09:58.573
You'll die!
 Come down!

01:09:58.864 --> 01:10:01.408
It's OK!
 Life means nothing to me.

01:10:01.702 --> 01:10:03.662
Just go ahead!

01:10:12.377 --> 01:10:14.006
I'll fulfill your wish then!

01:10:41.283 --> 01:10:42.533
What's he doing?
Sleeping!!

01:10:57.006 --> 01:10:58.466
Isn't it the new kung-fu skill

01:10:59.551 --> 01:11:01.301
created by the Master Ching?

01:11:02.261 --> 01:11:03.011
Set up! 

01:11:18.444 --> 01:11:19.569
Is it dawn already?

01:12:03.782 --> 01:12:04.948
Kick! 

01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:18.337
Thank you,
 I won!

01:12:18.546 --> 01:12:20.922
Yeah, you won,
 and so what?

01:12:21.716 --> 01:12:22.885
You're not qualified 
to be our leader!

01:12:26.095 --> 01:12:27.430
Hitting dog stick style?

01:12:31.643 --> 01:12:32.895
Hitting dog with the stick.

01:12:34.145 --> 01:12:36.398
Who says I can't use the stick?

01:12:36.479 --> 01:12:37.524
It doesn't look like that!

01:12:37.689 --> 01:12:38.649
Quite interesting.

01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:44.779
He broke our sticks.

01:12:45.989 --> 01:12:48.911
We should kill him
because he broke our leader's stick.

01:12:49.161 --> 01:12:50.787
Kill him! 

01:13:02.172 --> 01:13:04.216
Behave yourself.
 Hong-Chi-Kong is here!

01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:07.011
I made the rule before

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:11.890
anyone who can crack the deployment
has the right to be our leader.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.850
The reason that Beggar Gang

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:16.770
can be the top one...

01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:18.480
is all because we 
know "cooperation".

01:13:18.855 --> 01:13:21.109
I left the stick 
here long time ago"

01:13:21.234 --> 01:13:23.403
it's just a gift for 
you to remember me.

01:13:23.569 --> 01:13:26.029
The stick doesn't mean anything.

01:13:26.198 --> 01:13:28.158
But you stupid men
consider it a treasure.

01:13:28.323 --> 01:13:31.161
We've lost the unity in our Gang
because everyone wants to get it.

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:33.956
Don't you feel ashamed that there
hasn't been a leader for 5 years?

01:13:34.247 --> 01:13:37.000
Tsan broke the stick,
so you won't fight for the stick again.

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:38.335
What he did is right not wrong.

01:13:38.417 --> 01:13:39.670
Although he's not 
very experienced

01:13:39.837 --> 01:13:41.087
but he's very talented.

01:13:41.255 --> 01:13:43.131
And he's also the chosen one
who was trained by my disciple.

01:13:43.381 --> 01:13:45.006
Anyone who goes against him
goes against me.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.011
You are not only choosing him
to be the leader,

01:13:48.176 --> 01:13:51.555
you have to love 
and respect him.

01:13:51.765 --> 01:13:52.599
Invite him to have tea.

01:13:52.806 --> 01:13:53.975
Then I'll protect
our Beggar Gang prosperous forever...

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.688
even after I die.

01:14:00.524 --> 01:14:01.567
Is that true or false?

01:14:02.399 --> 01:14:04.194
I'd rather believe 
it's true not false.

01:14:04.653 --> 01:14:08.613
Hong-Chi-Kong is here.
 We are blessed..

01:14:09.739 --> 01:14:11.868
He's really a genius.
He can pass so easily.

01:14:16.162 --> 01:14:17.332
What happened?

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:21.042
Honourable leader!

01:14:21.377 --> 01:14:24.631
Great!

01:14:26.966 --> 01:14:28.216
Great!

01:14:30.261 --> 01:14:32.596
Mr. Mo,
 my son is very smart!

01:14:34.806 --> 01:14:36.560
I didn't know you learned
such a great kung-fu.

01:14:38.395 --> 01:14:41.148
From now on,
you're the leader of all beggars..

01:14:42.105 --> 01:14:45.068
This is an extraordinary book "Shan Long
Eighteen Palms" and Da-Hwang Pill.

01:14:45.277 --> 01:14:48.529
They're yours now. Hope you can be
a good leader from now on.

01:14:49.907 --> 01:14:51.658
I just hope I can 
save Ru-Shun back.

01:14:53.783 --> 01:14:55.412
She really has an eye for you.

01:14:56.162 --> 01:14:59.625
Great!
 Leader is the best...

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:10.051
Uncle Mo!
 What's wrong with you?

01:15:12.054 --> 01:15:14.930
Uncle Mo... 

01:16:03.479 --> 01:16:05.355
Tsan!
 Do you know how to use

01:16:05.564 --> 01:16:06.692
Shan Long Eighteen Palms?

01:16:06.859 --> 01:16:08.193
Don't think I'm boasting!

01:16:08.402 --> 01:16:10.069
But with the help 
of Da-Hwang Pill.

01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:13.073
My power is improved and my
blood vessels are in normal condition.

01:16:13.323 --> 01:16:16.283
I fully understand 
17 styles so far,

01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:19.203
but as for the 18th style.

01:16:19.371 --> 01:16:20.706
I can't see a picture
or written description.

01:16:20.912 --> 01:16:22.207
I just can't understand at all.

01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:24.376
The worst thing is that
Uncle Mo is gone.

01:16:24.585 --> 01:16:25.752
What should I do?

01:16:25.917 --> 01:16:26.877
Nothing to worry about!

01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:28.921
Anyway,
 I have to save Ru-Shun.

01:17:37.823 --> 01:17:39.618
Take a look and see
if everything is ready.

01:17:39.743 --> 01:17:40.618
Yes! 

01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:03.265
Chau!
Why do you bring the woman here?

01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:04.893
I know His Majesty 
like beautiful girls.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.979
So I want to dedicate one.

01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:08.814
I want to see His Majesty.

01:18:08.979 --> 01:18:11.314
His Majesty didn't summon you!
No need to bother His Majesty.

01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:13.819
Take the woman to see me. 

01:18:14.027 --> 01:18:15.779
Yes!
Go!

01:18:19.323 --> 01:18:22.158
Your Royalty!
You look very nice today!

01:18:23.368 --> 01:18:26.707
You should go back to your job.

01:18:27.497 --> 01:18:28.332
Yes!

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:46.518
Your Majesty!
Mr. Chau brings woman for Your Majesty.

01:18:47.225 --> 01:18:51.479
Woman? Chau...

01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:54.359
I'm taking a bath.
Take her to see me later.

01:18:54.568 --> 01:18:55.319
Yes!

01:19:17.256 --> 01:19:20.301
Son of a bitch!
He wants to see His Majesty.

01:19:21.426 --> 01:19:22.804
Ifyou see His Majesty more,

01:19:23.011 --> 01:19:24.471
maybe I'll lose my job!

01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:30.103
You come here!

01:19:31.895 --> 01:19:32.729
Your Royalty!!

01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:34.233
What happened?
Yes!

01:19:38.194 --> 01:19:40.948
Your Royalty!
There troops and horses in the forest.

01:19:41.323 --> 01:19:43.783
Who are they?
No idea!

01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:46.662
Burn the wolf excrement! Alert!
Yes!

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:57.756
The front camp burns wolf's excrement!
On alert!

01:19:57.965 --> 01:19:58.715
On alert! 

01:20:58.108 --> 01:20:59.274
Beggar!

01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:05.614
Tsan!
 What are you doing?

01:21:06.573 --> 01:21:09.453
Nothing! Just want you to donate
some money for me.

01:21:09.993 --> 01:21:12.122
Ridiculous!
 Do you want to be killed?

01:21:12.537 --> 01:21:13.788
It's you!
 Not me!

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:18.002
Chau was planning to rebel.
He's going to kill His Majesty!

01:21:18.127 --> 01:21:19.377
And you're still 
walk around here!

01:21:20.506 --> 01:21:24.551
Who do you think you are?
You're so bold to set the officer up.

01:21:24.801 --> 01:21:26.761
Ifyou move a little bit,
 I'll kill you! 

01:21:31.015 --> 01:21:33.850
Tsan! How can we cope
with so many people?

01:21:33.975 --> 01:21:34.728
Senior!
Yes! 

01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:36.270
How about the troops?

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.854
They are on the way.

01:21:39.439 --> 01:21:40.484
No more time to wait!

01:21:40.774 --> 01:21:42.734
I'll go first. You stay here
to be other brother's aid.

01:21:42.859 --> 01:21:44.154
I'll back you up!
What is real is good.

01:21:44.529 --> 01:21:45.822
Chief! You can be gone
without hesitation now.

01:21:46.613 --> 01:21:48.158
Am I dead? How can I go away
without hesitation?

01:21:48.198 --> 01:21:49.658
Can't you say some thing lucky?

01:21:50.202 --> 01:21:54.622
Yes!
Hope you can live as long as the sky.

01:21:54.913 --> 01:21:59.252
Happy birthday!
Same as today in the future years.

01:21:59.417 --> 01:22:01.171
Enough!
I didn't finish yet.

01:22:01.255 --> 01:22:02.712
You may sing after I go!
OK!

01:22:14.893 --> 01:22:17.020
Smoke from burning 
wolf's excrement!

01:22:19.604 --> 01:22:20.774
Chi-Lin Smoke is ready!
Yes!

01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:21.774
Let's attack and 
occupy their tents.

01:23:20.457 --> 01:23:25.087
Do they really want to rebel!
 Damn it!

01:23:25.255 --> 01:23:27.006
Damn it if we can't shoot you.

01:23:28.175 --> 01:23:31.720
Oh, no! The poisonous smoke
is toward His Majesty.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:39.019
No! The wind is blowing
in opposite way.s

01:23:39.435 --> 01:23:40.979
Yeah!
 Wait for me!

01:23:43.273 --> 01:23:45.734
Ifthe Beggar Gang don't retreat,
just kill them all.

01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:04.627
Look there!

01:24:08.881 --> 01:24:10.259
Chi-Li smoke of 
Tien-Li Religion sect!

01:24:20.725 --> 01:24:22.895
Calm down!
 Urine can neutralize poison.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.439
Pee Pee!

01:24:30.237 --> 01:24:31.572
I'm a girl!
 What should I do?

01:24:31.738 --> 01:24:34.908
Don't be afraid!
I can share my urine with you.

01:24:40.912 --> 01:24:42.082
Go... 

01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:51.466
How's the condition now?

01:24:51.841 --> 01:24:53.466
Your Majesty, the wind is blowing
the opposite direction.

01:24:53.635 --> 01:24:55.011
The poisonous smoke 
won't come this way.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.470
How about the front
and the guard troops?

01:24:56.636 --> 01:24:58.096
All over!
 Your Majesty!

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.225
Give me the sword!
Your Majesty...

01:25:01.393 --> 01:25:02.685
Don't stop me!
 Go away!

01:25:04.563 --> 01:25:06.189
Do we sit here 
waiting for death?

01:25:07.064 --> 01:25:10.903
Go! Go away!
 Go!

01:25:49.774 --> 01:25:50.609
To protect His Majesty!

01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:15.591
Tsan!

01:26:17.676 --> 01:26:18.426
Ru-Shun!

01:26:18.679 --> 01:26:19.930
How can you get here?

01:26:20.095 --> 01:26:22.349
It's a long story!

01:26:22.515 --> 01:26:24.393
I didn't even eat my midnight snack
before I left.

01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:25.475
After climbing 
Ching-Shan Mountain.

01:26:25.685 --> 01:26:27.563
We're already at the Great Wall.

01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:29.729
We stayed for half an hour.
We had breakfast

01:26:29.898 --> 01:26:30.858
and I pee pee too. 

01:26:30.983 --> 01:26:31.774
Really?

01:26:31.942 --> 01:26:34.194
Yes!
I can't find sweet potatoes but buns.

01:26:34.359 --> 01:26:36.613
You know I really 
don't like buns.

01:26:37.529 --> 01:26:39.783
I'm sorry to be late!
 Please forgive me.

01:26:41.868 --> 01:26:43.537
Escort His Majesty!
Yes!

01:26:47.247 --> 01:26:49.207
You betrayer. Catch him!
Yes!

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.672
Your Majesty! 

01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:00.761
Dog shit Emperor!
 Give me your country!

01:27:00.886 --> 01:27:01.845
What?

01:27:04.806 --> 01:27:05.559
It's you!

01:27:05.725 --> 01:27:07.269
It's me!
 Su-Chi-Ar!

01:27:07.895 --> 01:27:10.939
Su-Chi-Ar? Are you still sleeping
in the Beggar Gang's place?

01:27:11.148 --> 01:27:13.192
Yes!
 I really feel sleepy!

01:27:48.935 --> 01:27:49.770
Sleepy Po-Hang! 

01:27:49.978 --> 01:27:54.024
You really look like a beggar
with hair on your back.

01:27:54.233 --> 01:27:55.692
Are you interested 
in joining our gang?

01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:59.738
Every dog has it's day. 

01:27:59.904 --> 01:28:01.532
Yes!
 Thanks to you.

01:28:05.786 --> 01:28:07.953
You have done your best?
 Not me!

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.850
Fool!
 ln the whole world,

01:28:29.015 --> 01:28:30.560

No.7, flying dragon in the sky!

01:28:49.328 --> 01:28:50.787
Magic dragon waving the tail!
Black dragon stealing the heart.

01:28:50.912 --> 01:28:52.372
Double dragons toward the sea!
Dragon in the farm! Dragon fly, phoenix!

01:28:52.541 --> 01:28:54.001
Creeping tiger catches the dragon!
Mixture of dragons and snakes!

Inheritors of the dragon!

01:28:55.711 --> 01:28:57.587
Wishing husband to be a dragon!
Finish now!

01:29:30.912 --> 01:29:33.288
Only seventeen styles?
 Too bad!

01:29:33.457 --> 01:29:35.626
You will beat me
ifyou can use eighteen styles!

01:29:35.707 --> 01:29:36.960
But you don't have the chance!

01:29:44.841 --> 01:29:45.719
Tsan!

01:29:59.524 --> 01:30:00.359
I got it!

01:30:00.567 --> 01:30:03.237
The 18th style
is the combination of 17 styles.

01:30:03.403 --> 01:30:05.154
I'm too smart!

01:30:33.765 --> 01:30:36.103
The 18th style,
 Shan Long Yo Hwei.

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.800
Tsan,
 are you OK?

01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:08.801
Look at my style.
 Do you think it is OK?

01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:12.345
You look cool
but I can see there is something wrong.

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:14.640
Fool! I am OK.
No problem for my wedding night.

01:31:14.806 --> 01:31:15.640
So great!

01:31:25.319 --> 01:31:26.987
Tsan!
 Are you OK?

01:31:27.112 --> 01:31:28.363
Fine!
Tswe!

01:31:28.488 --> 01:31:29.448
Where is Chau?

01:31:30.323 --> 01:31:32.576
Everywhere!
Everywhere?

01:31:32.826 --> 01:31:34.703
Now it is dust!

01:31:34.953 --> 01:31:37.247
Dust? Too bosh.

01:31:37.497 --> 01:31:40.375
Leader!
Chau's people are all caught by us!

01:31:44.002 --> 01:31:45.255

01:31:52.886 --> 01:31:56.265
Yes! Superior to all the other people
except the king.

01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:58.310
He must be the best! 

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.145
It is a pity I can never have the chance
to be the top candidate.

01:32:00.435 --> 01:32:04.608
Yes!
But I like beggars not top candidate.

01:32:06.693 --> 01:32:07.859
Let's go! 

01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:21.832

be a little beggar.

You look very talented 
to be a beggar..

01:32:31.216 --> 01:32:34.386
Report your arrival and tell them my
name in City God Temple tomorrow.

01:32:35.889 --> 01:32:38.140
Thanks for your help!n

01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:40.894
Tsan,
 what do you want?

01:32:43.814 --> 01:32:45.064
Do you really have 
nothing to say?

01:32:49.069 --> 01:32:50.944
There's nothing to say.
 Go!t

01:32:51.488 --> 01:32:52.654
Help me stand up!

01:32:53.738 --> 01:32:55.492
Hero, Mr. Su! 

01:32:55.617 --> 01:32:56.658
Let me down!!

01:32:57.033 --> 01:32:59.287
Don't think you saved me before.
You don't respect me!

01:32:59.453 --> 01:33:00.706
I will still kill you!m

01:33:01.331 --> 01:33:03.375
Ifyou really want to kill me,
you won't say things to me like this!

01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:06.670
Do not move after kneeing down.
Otherwise, you will get attention.!

01:33:09.546 --> 01:33:13.091
We really have nothing to say..

01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.636
You have more than
ten millions of disciples in your gang.

01:33:14.886 --> 01:33:17.139
How can I take it easy
if you don't dismiss?

01:33:18.055 --> 01:33:20.015
I can't decide the 
numbers of disciples.

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:21.185
You make the decision.

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:22.185
Me? 

01:33:22.728 --> 01:33:25.979
If you're really so powerful to keep
the country prosperous and strong.

01:33:26.439 --> 01:33:28.274
No one will like to be beggars!

01:33:29.609 --> 01:33:32.069
It makes sense.
Do your best!!

01:33:33.279 --> 01:33:34.448
But how about this, 

01:33:34.573 --> 01:33:36.948
you have to buy me face,
so I won't lose my face.

01:33:37.826 --> 01:33:39.703

01:33:50.005 --> 01:33:51.046
I can recognize you

01:33:51.171 --> 01:33:53.550
Dirty beggar! Do you try to win
sympathy by carrying a daughter?

01:33:53.675 --> 01:33:57.054
Yes! Please give me some money.
Go away! No money to beggars!

01:33:57.179 --> 01:33:59.346
I have the licence.
 You must give me!

01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:02.850
Imperial decree, "To beg food."
Are you sure?

01:34:03.143 --> 01:34:05.310

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.479
I am afraid ofyou.
Do not go!

01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:08.774
What's wrong again?

01:34:08.939 --> 01:34:11.734
