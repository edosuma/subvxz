THE BAD NEWS IS MY MAN WON'T

07:04.511 --> 07:06.426
HE'S DECIDED
TO LEAVE THE NEST.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.949

07:43.550 --> 07:45.334
3 HOURS AWAY?

07:45.377 --> 07:47.205
I'M NEVER GONNA SEE YOU.

07:47.249 --> 07:51.993
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE
RAISING A BABY IN THE CITY.

07:52.036 --> 07:55.692
THIS HOUSE, IT IS LIKE A
MALIBU BARBIE DREAM HOUSE.

07:55.736 --> 07:59.435
I MEAN, THIS WOULD
BE A PROJECT FOR ME,
NOT SOME CLIENT.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.306

COUPLE OF THEM PAY OFF,

08:06.834 --> 08:08.662
THEN HE CAN SUPPORT ME.

08:08.705 --> 08:12.013
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.580
THANK YOU.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.713
OH, GOD.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.589

08:22.632 --> 08:23.981
I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE STRAPPED,

08:24.025 --> 08:28.290
BUT SHE'D BE
JUST AS HAPPY WITH
A PLACEHOLDER RING.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.421
I DON'T WANNA BE THAT GUY.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.120
I'M NOT GONNA GET
HER A PIECE OF SHIT.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.381
OK, OK.

08:33.424 --> 08:34.948
I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU WERE ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE

08:34.991 --> 08:36.341
WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN MARRIAGE.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.953
YOUR PARENTS WERE
MARRIED, RIGHT?

08:38.996 --> 08:40.563
3 TIMES EACH.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.912
AHA.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.871
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEPLACE.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.308

WHEN YOU STARE AT US
WHILE YOU'RE TALKING,

08:48.745 --> 08:51.139
THEN WE KNOW YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT US.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.880
OH, WOMEN HAVE
AMAZING POWERS.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.578
UH, CAN I GET YOU
A NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.537
NO, WE HAVE TO GO
BACK TO THE OFFICE.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.712
WE HAVE TO FINISH

09:20.603 --> 09:21.952

09:29.481 --> 09:31.222
NO, I'M BEING SERIOUS.

09:31.266 --> 09:34.051
THEY COME WITH SKULLS.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.487
MY MOTHER'S A DISASTER.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.620
I MEAN, WHAT
IF THAT'S GENETIC?

09:37.664 --> 09:41.232
WHAT IF I INHERIT ALL
HER MATERNAL INCOMPETENCE?

09:41.276 --> 09:45.193
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
A GENE FOR THAT, PENNY.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.065
PENNY?

09:50.807 --> 09:52.330

IT'S LIKE I BLACKED

11:39.786 --> 11:41.483
HE'S SO CUTE.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.833
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.707
OK. THIS IS YOUR DAD.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.446

12:43.501 --> 12:44.851
Penny:
HEY, I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING,

12:44.894 --> 12:46.635
BUT I TALKED TO
THE REALTOR IN STANTON.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.811
I TOLD HIM IF HE
CUT HIS FEE IN HALF,

12:48.855 --> 12:50.770
WE COULD CLOSE
THE DEAL RIGHT NOW.

12:50.813 --> 12:54.774
HE MUST BE SICK OF MY HAGGLING
BECAUSE HE WENT FOR IT.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.819
I JUST THINK
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

12:56.863 --> 12:57.820
IT'S SUCH A STEAL.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.170
WE'D BE CRAZY
TO PASS THIS UP.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.521
AND I REALLY BELIEVE I CAN TURN
IT INTO SOMETHING SPECTACULAR.

13:03.565 --> 13:07.090
ANYWAY, I'LL GRAB SOMETHING FROM
CARMINE'S ON THE WAY HOME.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.310
WE CAN START
HAMMERING IT OUT.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.400
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OK WITH THIS.

13:12.443 --> 13:15.185
IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY DOUBTS

13:15.229 --> 13:18.536
OK? I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

13:54.398 --> 13:58.489

DREARY IN THE LATE MONTHS.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.188
BUT YOU KNOW,

14:01.231 --> 14:03.668
TREES, I MEAN, IT'S GONNA--

14:03.712 --> 14:08.064
WE COULD JUST PAINT IT,
PAINT THE BRICK.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.766
HMM.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.815
IT'S FROM MICHAEL.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.077

14:21.121 --> 14:23.384
"MAY THIS BEAUTIFUL TREE
REPRESENT YOUR GROWING

14:23.427 --> 14:27.344
LOVE AND BLOOMING HOPES,
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."

14:27.388 --> 14:30.434
DOES IT REALLY SAY,
"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH"?

14:30.478 --> 14:32.784

15:12.650 --> 15:17.090
YEAH, I JUST
SOMETHING ELSE WE COULDN'T

15:17.133 --> 15:19.092
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE

GET RID OF THAT THING.

15:30.799 --> 15:35.456
WELL, NOW
EVERYTHING WE COOK'S
GONNA TASTE LIKE BABY.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.241
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.822
THAT'S IN THE KITCHEN.

16:32.121 --> 16:36.038
CAN YOUR GUYS GET

16:36.082 --> 16:37.039
NO, NO, NO.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.345
YOU GOTTA ARRANGE
FOR A JUNK MAN.

16:38.388 --> 16:42.523
I CANNOT PUT MY PIANO
IN THERE WITH THIS STUFF.

16:42.566 --> 16:46.744
SO WHAT, JUST LEAVE IT
HERE ON THE GROUND?

17:45.020 --> 17:48.806
WHAT IS ALL THIS CRAP?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.686
SORRY.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.953
CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND
WITH ANYTHING?

18:04.996 --> 18:09.044
NO, BUT MAYBE LATER
YOU COULD HELP ME
WITH THE MONITOR?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.306
OK.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.439
POOR GIRL.

18:12.482 --> 18:16.225
PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT
SHE DID TO DESERVE THIS.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.835
HMM.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.057
A LOT OF CRAP IN HERE.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.705
SHIT!

19:01.749 --> 19:03.664

19:31.126 --> 19:32.127
GOT IT.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.563
SHOULD I PUT IT
BACK ON THE SHELF?!

19:33.607 --> 19:34.999
YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL.

19:35.043 --> 19:39.526
I CAN HEAR YOU
THROUGH THE MONITOR.

19:39.569 --> 19:40.657
OK.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.921
YEAH, PUT IT
BACK ON THE SHELF.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.188
I THINK YOU HAVE IT
POINTING AT THE CEILING.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.277
YOU NEED TO POINT IT
DOWN TO THE CRIB.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.018
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.412
JUST MOVE IT A LITTLE
BIT TO THE LEFT.

20:01.112 --> 20:04.203
WHAT'S WRONG?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.428
OH, GOD.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.778
WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING MY MOM?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.345
I'M SORRY, BABE.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.738
I LOVE YOUR MOTHER,

20:17.781 --> 20:19.696
BUT THE EFFECT WITH THE
CAMERA WAS A LITTLE CREEPY.

20:19.740 --> 20:23.134
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE MONITOR?

20:23.178 --> 20:24.135
IT'S GOOD.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.921
MOVE IT TWO INCHES
TO THE RIGHT.

20:43.590 --> 20:46.070
WHAT'S GOIN' ON WITH HIM?

20:46.114 --> 20:50.771
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I
CANNOT GO BACK IN THERE.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.010
THAT COUNTS AS A TURN.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.843
OH, GOD.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.225
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

21:56.924 --> 21:58.534
OW.

21:58.578 --> 22:01.189
OH, MY GOD.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.147
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:03.191 --> 22:05.585
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T KNOW.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.067
GO SEE.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.417
YEAH.

22:12.722 --> 22:15.159
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.291
I'LL--I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.294
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HIM INSIDE?

22:58.551 --> 23:01.118
I'M GONNA THROW UP.

23:03.599 --> 23:07.124
HOW COULD WE NOT KNOW?

23:07.821 --> 23:10.432
WE SAW IT ON A SUNDAY.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.738
WE MOVED IN ON A SUNDAY.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.566
WE CAN'T
LIVE LIKE THIS.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.915
WITH TANNER
NOT SLEEPING?

23:14.958 --> 23:16.438
IT WAS HIS FIRST
NIGHT LIKE THAT.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.353
WE'LL--WE'LL GET REST.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.094
YOU NEED QUIET.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.443
I'LL MANAGE.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.490
I MEAN, THAT WAS--
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.100
NAH, WE'LL BE FINE.

23:26.143 --> 23:29.103
I MEAN, HOW LONG
CAN THIS LAST?

23:29.146 --> 23:30.452
A FEW WEEKS?

23:47.774 --> 23:52.126
♪ HERE IN THE LEAVES
OF THE FALLEN TREE ♪

23:52.169 --> 23:57.000
♪ MY BODY'S
BREAKING DOWN ON ME ♪

23:57.044 --> 23:59.307
♪ MMM

23:59.350 --> 24:04.443
♪ MY PAIN
WON'T MIND AT ALL ♪

25:01.456 --> 25:02.501
Man: BITCH!

25:07.070 --> 25:09.508
ALEX?

25:18.865 --> 25:21.476
SON OF A BITCH!

25:25.262 --> 25:29.397
THESE DUMB ASSES DIDN'T
HOOK UP THE DRYER EXHAUST.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.531
I COULD HEAR YOU ALL THE WAY
UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.881
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS THAT LOUD.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.971
NO, IT MUST BE THE PIPES.

25:38.014 --> 25:42.366
JUST ANOTHER CHARMING
IDIOSYNCRASY OF THIS HOUSE.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.630
I--I GOT IT.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.762
YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE
YOU LEAVING THE BABY

25:46.806 --> 25:48.329
ALONE UP
THERE LIKE THAT.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.940
NO, I--I--I'VE GOT
THE INTERNET HOOKED UP.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.290
HE'S JUST WATCHING FLORIN.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.512
OK.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.605
Man, echoing voice:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:46.648 --> 26:47.649
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:47.693 --> 26:49.433
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:49.477 --> 26:51.522
COME ON.

26:51.566 --> 26:54.569
PLAY SOMETHING.

26:59.226 --> 27:00.270
HEY.

27:00.314 --> 27:03.360
I NEED HELP
WITH THE BABY.

27:13.762 --> 27:16.330
LOOK, I JUST NEED YOU
TO BATHE HIM FOR ME.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.679
I HAVE TO GO LIE DOWN.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.246
OK.

27:19.289 --> 27:23.511
MAKE SURE YOU
CLEAN THE SINK BEFORE
YOU PUT HIM IN, OK?

27:23.990 --> 27:25.556
WAIT.
I-I DON'T PUT THE BABY

27:25.600 --> 27:28.951
IN THE SINK FULL
OF DIRTY DISHES?

27:30.387 --> 27:32.563
SHUT UP.

27:34.522 --> 27:38.482
I'M GONNA
PUT YOU RIGHT HERE.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.571
RIGHT THERE.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.620
LOOK AT THAT.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.840
YOU READY FOR YOUR BATH?

27:47.883 --> 27:49.842
HMM?

28:55.821 --> 28:58.649
I FOUND TANNER'S BLANKIE.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.390
IT WAS IN THE GUEST ROOM.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.522
HEY, BUDDY.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.698
LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN THE GUEST ROOM.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.308
I FOUND YOUR BLANKIE.

29:05.352 --> 29:06.266
YEAH.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.790
YEAH, DO YOU LIKE THAT?

29:08.834 --> 29:09.748
OW!

29:09.791 --> 29:12.794
GOD, WHAT IS
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

29:14.361 --> 29:16.755
GOD!

29:16.798 --> 29:18.626
DID YOU NOT THINK
TO CHECK THE WATER?

29:18.669 --> 29:21.411
I DID CHECK IT WHEN
I WAS FILLING IT UP.

29:21.455 --> 29:22.282
OH, MY GOD.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.893
IF I HADN'T
COME IN HERE--.

29:27.461 --> 29:31.291
I CAN'T EVEN LEAVE
THE BABY ALONE WITH
YOU FOR ONE MINUTE.

29:31.334 --> 29:35.382
I CAN'T DO
EVERYTHING MYSELF.

29:41.867 --> 29:42.955
NO, JUST GO.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.740
I'VE GOT IT.
DON'T EVEN.

30:48.411 --> 30:51.588
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON THE FLOOR?

30:52.676 --> 30:54.374
HEY.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.375
OH.

30:55.418 --> 30:58.160
YOU'RE GETTING HEAVY.

30:58.682 --> 31:03.513
AHH. OHH, OHH.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.864
OHH.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.405
OHH.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.134
IT'S THEIR LUNCH BREAK.

31:59.178 --> 32:02.442
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET
SOME SLEEP FOR AN HOUR.

32:02.485 --> 32:04.183
PENNY?

32:04.226 --> 32:06.446
PENNY?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.887
HEY.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.457
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:19.285 --> 32:21.809
HERE.
LET ME TAKE HIM.

32:21.852 --> 32:22.984
COME ON.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.987
COME ON. COME ON.
YOU'RE FREAKIN' ME OUT.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.989
NO.
PENNY.

32:28.033 --> 32:28.990
I'M FINE.
HEY, HEY.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.122
I'M OK. I'M OK.
TALK TO ME.

32:30.165 --> 32:31.384
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
IN THERE?

32:31.427 --> 32:32.994
DON'T YELL AT ME, ALL RIGHT?

32:33.038 --> 32:35.431
I'M TIRED AND I'M--
I'M SCARED.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.956
WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF?

32:38.260 --> 32:40.915
AHH. I SAW...

32:40.959 --> 32:42.134
WHAT?

32:42.177 --> 32:45.006
SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.573
IT WAS
THROUGH THE MIRROR.

32:46.616 --> 32:50.011
SHE RAN BY AND
THEN SHE WAS GONE.

32:50.055 --> 32:54.885
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I WAS ASLEEP.

32:55.843 --> 32:59.064
I CAN'T EVEN SEE
STRAIGHT ANYMORE.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.371
I'M LOSING IT, TOO.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.852
THEY SAY PEOPLE
START TO HALLUCINATE.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.941
IT'S A FACT.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.074
I GOOGLED IT.

33:13.034 --> 33:16.690
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
STAND MUCH MORE OF THIS.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.084
I NEED TO SLEEP.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.043
I MEAN, HOW LONG
HAS IT BEEN?

33:22.087 --> 33:23.218
FIVE DAYS?

33:23.262 --> 33:25.351
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.701
I'VE LOST TRACK.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.878
IT'LL GET BETTER.

33:30.921 --> 33:33.054
I PROMISE.

34:53.569 --> 34:56.398
Woman: GET OUT!

35:21.467 --> 35:22.250
PENNY?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.170
PENNY.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.694
PENNY.

35:31.738 --> 35:34.175
WAKE UP.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.073
GOD! WHAT?!

36:03.117 --> 36:05.685
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:20.700 --> 36:23.181
YOU OK?

36:24.094 --> 36:25.661
YEAH.

36:26.532 --> 36:30.927
I JUST HAD A REALLY
WEIRD DREAM.

36:31.276 --> 36:34.148
AT LEAST YOU'RE SLEEPING.

36:37.151 --> 36:40.110
CAN YOU TURN OUT THE LIGHT?

37:01.044 --> 37:02.132
OHH.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.746
I CAN HANDLE IT.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.749
I CAN HANDLE IT.

37:28.985 --> 37:31.336
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T
KNOWN EACH OTHER,

37:31.379 --> 37:33.207
JUST MAYBE
A FEW MONTHS NOW,

37:33.251 --> 37:36.471
BUT...NORMALLY I'M
NOT A TRAIN WRECK.

37:36.515 --> 37:39.126
YOU KNOW,
I'M ACTUALLY REALLY FUN.

37:39.169 --> 37:44.305
LIKE, NOT LIKE PARTY
GIRL FUN, BUT...FUN.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.186
DAMN IT!

38:17.382 --> 38:21.037
PRETEND YOU DIDN'T
SEE THAT.

38:23.779 --> 38:30.220
IF DADDY SELLS ONE
OF HIS DEMOS...
HE'LL PAY FOR THERAPY.

38:31.657 --> 38:34.268
FOR BOTH OF US.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.822
Michael: HEY, ALEX.
IT'S MICHAEL. FRIDAY.

39:06.866 --> 39:09.303
I LEFT A MESSAGE
FOR YOU THE OTHER DAY.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.565
HOW'S THE HOUSE?

39:10.609 --> 39:13.133
ALL THAT PEACE AND QUIET
DRIVING YOU CRAZY YET?

39:13.176 --> 39:15.614
JOHANNA AND I WOULD
LOVE TO COME DOWN AND,

39:15.657 --> 39:16.789
UH, CHECK THE PLACE OUT.

39:16.832 --> 39:18.921
I'M SURE YOU'RE READY
TO GET DRUNK

39:18.965 --> 39:20.967
AND ADMIT
THAT YOU SCREWED UP.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.404
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
YOU SCREWED UP, RIGHT?

39:23.448 --> 39:26.059
BIG TIME.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

39:26.102 --> 39:27.626
THIS IS YOUR LIFE NOW.

39:27.669 --> 39:31.412
WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE IS
NOTHING BUT THAT HOUSE.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.633
YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN A DEMO,
NOT ONE VERSE, NOT ONE NOTE

39:34.676 --> 39:36.504
OF MUSIC THE WHOLE TIME
YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.289
YOU JUST STAGGER AROUND LIKE
A ZOMBIE, HAVING NIGHTMARES

39:39.333 --> 39:41.335
ABOUT A WOMAN,
BECAUSE SHE TOLD YOU

39:41.379 --> 39:43.337
SHE SAW A WOMAN
IN THE HOUSE.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.035
SHE PUT IT IN YOUR HEAD
AND NOW LOOK AT YOU.

39:46.079 --> 39:46.993
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?

39:47.036 --> 39:48.560
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

39:48.603 --> 39:52.912
DID YOU NOT SEE
TANNER SITTING HERE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?

39:57.830 --> 39:59.788
WHY DID YOU LEAVE HIM
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS?

39:59.832 --> 40:00.963
I DIDN'T PUT HIM THERE!

40:01.007 --> 40:02.661
Y-Y-YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT Y-Y-YOU DIDN'T

40:02.704 --> 40:05.011
PUT HIM IN THE WAGON AND
SET HIM RIGHT THERE?

40:05.054 --> 40:08.057
YES, I PUT HIM IN THE WAGON,
BUT I HAD HIM IN THE NURSERY.

40:08.101 --> 40:10.451
YOU JUST SAID YOU DIDN'T
PUT HIM IN THERE.

40:10.495 --> 40:11.757
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT--

40:11.800 --> 40:13.411
I DIDN'T PUT HIM AT THE TOP
OF THE STAIRS, ALEX!

40:13.454 --> 40:16.196
OK. Y-YOU HAVE GOT TO
MANAGE THIS SITUATION
BETTER, ALL RIGHT?

40:16.239 --> 40:18.154
I DID NOT PUT HIM AT
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, ALEX!

40:18.198 --> 40:19.547
YOU JUST SAID YOU PUT
HIM IN THE WAGON!

40:19.591 --> 40:20.940
I DIDN'T. YOU'RE WALKING
AROUND IN A COMPLETE STUPOR!

40:20.983 --> 40:22.289
OK, I GOTTA GET
OUTTA HERE.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.116
IT WAS PROBABLY YOU!

40:23.159 --> 40:25.727
I'M GONNA GO
TO THE STORE.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.983
SWEETIE, PUT
SOME SHOES ON.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.304
WHAT'S WRONG?

41:22.001 --> 41:22.915
NOTHING. I, UH...

41:22.958 --> 41:24.960
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OK TO DRIVE?

41:25.004 --> 41:27.006
UH...

41:29.443 --> 41:32.402
I JUST DRIFTED
OFF FOR A SECOND.

41:32.446 --> 41:35.797
YOU FORGOT THE LIST.
I TALKED TO DR. GORDON.

41:35.841 --> 41:36.798
HE SAID TRY GRIPE WATER.

41:36.842 --> 41:39.497
HE MAY BE HAVING
GAS AT NIGHT.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.063
GRIPE WATER.

41:41.107 --> 41:42.021
ALL RIGHT.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.502
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
OK TO LEAVE?

41:44.545 --> 41:45.590
I'M FINE.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.069
I'M FINE.

41:47.113 --> 41:48.462
OK.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.420
DON'T BE GONE LONG.

42:50.176 --> 42:52.526
THANK YOU.

42:56.530 --> 42:58.097
WHOA!

42:59.054 --> 43:00.273
FOR A SECOND THERE,

43:00.316 --> 43:02.884
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE GRIM REAPER.

43:04.364 --> 43:06.801
I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE!

43:13.460 --> 43:16.898
SO I WOULD
NORMALLY NEVER ASK
A CUSTOMER THIS,

43:16.942 --> 43:20.032
BUT, UM, ARE YOU OK?

43:20.075 --> 43:20.989
YEAH.

43:21.033 --> 43:22.643
I'M HANGIN' IN THERE,
I SUPPOSE.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.166
NEW BABY?

43:24.210 --> 43:25.907
5 MONTHS OLD.

43:25.951 --> 43:27.343
OH.

43:27.387 --> 43:28.649
DOESN'T SLEEP?

43:28.693 --> 43:30.259
NOW WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO.

43:30.303 --> 43:32.610
HE'S GOT IT ALL UPSIDE-DOWN.

43:32.653 --> 43:34.655
THEY GOT A TERM FOR IT.

43:34.699 --> 43:37.049
IT'S CALLED
DAY/NIGHT CONFUSION.

43:37.092 --> 43:40.574
THAT'D BE A REALLY
GOOD NAME FOR A BAND.

43:45.884 --> 43:47.929
WHAT?

43:49.757 --> 43:51.846
YOU LIKE BABIES?

43:52.368 --> 43:57.591
UM, I WOULDN'T CHOOSE TO
LIKE, HANG OUT WITH ONE,

43:57.635 --> 44:00.550
BUT I KNOW SOMETIMES
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

44:02.901 --> 44:07.470
ARE YOU ASKING ME IF
I'LL BABY-SIT FOR YOU?

44:07.514 --> 44:09.298
YEAH.

44:09.342 --> 44:10.909
YEAH. YES.

44:10.952 --> 44:12.693
DOES YOUR TV WORK?

44:12.737 --> 44:13.868
YOU'LL DO IT?

44:13.912 --> 44:15.087
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY
QUESTION ABOUT THE TV.

44:15.130 --> 44:19.004
OK, ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
OUR CABLE DOESN'T WORK.

44:19.047 --> 44:19.918
OH.

44:19.961 --> 44:21.615
BUT OUR DVD PLAYER
WORKS GREAT.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.182
OK, OK.
TAKE IT EASY.

44:23.225 --> 44:24.444
OK, SO YOU'LL DO IT?

44:24.487 --> 44:26.794
I MEAN, WE JUST NEED
SOMEONE TO--WHO WILL, UH,

44:26.838 --> 44:28.361
TO STAY THE NIGHT
WITH THE BABY.

44:28.404 --> 44:29.492
THAT, I MEAN, THAT'S IT.

44:29.536 --> 44:30.885
OK.
I CAN TRUST YOU?

44:30.929 --> 44:32.191
YOU CAN TOTALLY
TRUST ME.

44:32.234 --> 44:34.802
LIKE, I'M NOT
GONNA TOUCH YOUR
LIQUOR CABINET.

44:34.846 --> 44:36.412
I HAD ONE TOO MANY
WINE COOLERS ONCE

44:36.456 --> 44:40.286
WHEN I WAS 14,
SO I DON'T TOUCH
THE STUFF.

44:40.329 --> 44:41.635
SMART GIRL.

44:41.679 --> 44:42.767
YEAH.

44:42.810 --> 44:45.552
SO, UM, I NORMALLY
WOULD ASK 10 AN HOUR,

44:45.595 --> 44:47.423
BUT SINCE I'M GONNA BE
DOING THIS OVERNIGHT--

44:47.467 --> 44:51.427
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I MEAN...HERE.

44:51.471 --> 44:53.516
OK.

44:53.560 --> 44:57.346
YEAH, YOU JUST
GAVE ME A HUNDRED, SO...

45:27.333 --> 45:28.813
HI.

45:28.856 --> 45:31.641
SO I HAVE A BABY BROTHER
AND A BABY SISTER.

45:31.685 --> 45:33.774
AND MY OLDER SISTER
HAS A BABY.

45:33.818 --> 45:36.734
AND MY OLDER BROTHER
HAS A BABY.

45:36.777 --> 45:37.952
YOU WANNA HEAR
ABOUT MY COUSINS?

45:37.996 --> 45:42.565
NO, THAT'S...
NO, THAT'S GOOD.

45:43.828 --> 45:45.090
NICE PLACE.

45:45.133 --> 45:48.310
SO, UM, IF HE SLEEPS,

45:48.354 --> 45:50.704
THEN YOU CAN BRING HIM
UPSTAIRS TO HIS CRIB.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.881
BUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
SINCE WE MOVED IN HERE

45:53.925 --> 45:55.883
IS HE WAKES UP
EVERY 15 MINUTES.

45:55.927 --> 45:58.407
IF THAT'S THE CASE, I WOULD
JUST KEEP HIM DOWN HERE.

45:58.451 --> 46:01.889
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
PUT HIM TO SLEEP
ON HIS BELLY, RIGHT?

46:01.933 --> 46:03.369
YEAH, OF COURSE.

46:03.412 --> 46:05.806
AND IF HE---IF HE'S SLEEPIN'
AND YOU GET TIRED, YOU KNOW,

46:05.850 --> 46:07.765
YOU CAN JUST CRASH
OUT ON THE COUCH.

46:07.808 --> 46:08.896
OR WE HAVE COKE IN THE FRIDGE.

46:08.940 --> 46:11.769
OR, UM, COFFEE.
WE HAVE A COFFEE MAKER.

46:11.812 --> 46:13.466
NO, I DON'T DO CAFFEINE.

46:13.509 --> 46:14.293
REALLY?

46:14.336 --> 46:16.686
SHE DOESN'T DRINK
EITHER.

46:16.730 --> 46:18.688
AND NO RED MEAT.

46:18.732 --> 46:20.516
IF THAT MATTERS.

46:21.561 --> 46:24.303
WELL, THAT'S
ACTUALLY KIND OF COOL.

46:27.610 --> 46:30.570
BUT REALLY, I DON'T WANT
YOU TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

46:30.613 --> 46:32.137
OR THE BABY, OF COURSE.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.529
I SLEPT ALL DAY.

46:33.573 --> 46:34.792
SO THIS IS NOT GONNA BE
A PROBLEM FOR ME

46:34.835 --> 46:36.010
TO MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

46:36.054 --> 46:37.838
BUT YOU
KNOW WHAT I CAN'T DO?

46:37.882 --> 46:38.970
HMM?

46:39.013 --> 46:40.449
I CAN'T CARRY BOTH OF
YOU GUYS UPSTAIRS.

46:40.493 --> 46:44.758
SO, UH, Y'ALL
MIGHT WANT TO BE
THINKING ABOUT BED, HUH?

46:44.802 --> 46:46.325
YEAH.

46:46.368 --> 46:48.240
YEAH.

46:56.726 --> 46:58.206
YOU GUYS NEED
ONE OF THOSE, LIKE,

46:58.250 --> 47:03.559
ELECTRIC CHAIRS
THAT CARRIES YOU UP
AND DOWN THE STAIRS.

47:03.603 --> 47:04.778
WHAT?

47:04.822 --> 47:06.824
NOTHING.

47:06.867 --> 47:08.303
NEVER MIND.

47:09.174 --> 47:10.871
ELECTRIC CHAIR.

47:10.915 --> 47:13.918
I THINK SHE WAS
MAKING A JOKE.

47:18.487 --> 47:20.446
THANK YOU FOR THIS.

47:20.489 --> 47:21.621
YOU WERE RIGHT.

47:22.622 --> 47:26.800
I LOVE HEARING YOU
SAY I'M RIGHT.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.368
GET SOME SLEEP.

47:37.115 --> 47:42.903
YOU DON'T THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THIS PLACE, DO YOU?

47:42.947 --> 47:44.862
I THINK ONE
GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

47:44.905 --> 47:47.908
AND ALL THIS SHIT'S
GONNA GO AWAY.

47:47.952 --> 47:49.257
OK?

47:52.434 --> 47:54.610
YEAH.

50:10.050 --> 50:12.966
HAL?

50:29.113 --> 50:31.419
WE'RE DOING GOOD DOWN HERE.

50:31.463 --> 50:35.423
I THINK HE'S GONNA
STAY DOWN FOR A WHILE.

50:36.294 --> 50:39.688
UM, DO YOU WANNA
PUT HIM IN HIS CRIB?

50:39.732 --> 50:41.560
OR SHOULD I DO IT?

50:48.219 --> 50:52.266
UM, DO YOU WANT ME TO...

50:55.878 --> 50:57.228
YOU KNOW WHAT?

50:57.271 --> 50:59.795
I'M GONNA GET HIM FOR YOU.

54:28.656 --> 54:31.703
IT WAS TOO GOOD TO LAST.

54:31.746 --> 54:33.661
NEED MORE SLEEP.

54:33.705 --> 54:37.230
LIKE 24 HOURS MORE.

54:37.448 --> 54:39.188
HOW ABOUT 12 MORE HOURS?

54:39.232 --> 54:40.189
DEAL?
HMM?

54:40.233 --> 54:41.539
12 MORE, HONEY.

54:41.582 --> 54:43.758

54:43.802 --> 54:45.934

THE DAY OFF.

54:45.978 --> 54:47.153
SUNDAY.
UH-HUH.

54:47.196 --> 54:48.415
IT'S THE LORD'S DAY.

54:48.459 --> 54:50.199
HALLELUJAH.

54:50.243 --> 54:51.157

54:51.200 --> 54:52.550
LET'S GO SEE
TANNER AND PAY HER

54:52.593 --> 54:54.291
AND SEE IF
SHE CAN COME BACK.

55:09.218 --> 55:11.699
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD
YOU LET IN THIS HOUSE?

55:11.743 --> 55:12.918
PENNY.

55:12.961 --> 55:14.572
SOME TEENAGER YOU MET
AT THE GROCERY STORE!

55:14.615 --> 55:15.703
PENNY, CALM DOWN.

55:15.747 --> 55:16.878
NO REFERENCES!

55:16.922 --> 55:18.140
I MEAN, WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW HER LAST NAME!

55:18.184 --> 55:19.968
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HER FIRST NAME?

55:20.012 --> 55:22.057
I MEAN, WHAT IS GOING
ON WITH THIS HOUSE

55:22.101 --> 55:24.408
THAT SOMEONE
WOULD LEAVE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?!

55:24.451 --> 55:26.453
YOU'RE--YOU'RE
TAKING IT TOO FAR.

55:26.497 --> 55:27.628
NO, I'M NOT!

55:27.672 --> 55:28.673
PENNY, PLEASE!

55:28.716 --> 55:30.370

55:30.414 --> 55:31.980

55:32.024 --> 55:33.417
I-I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

55:33.460 --> 55:35.375
BUT SHE'S GONE,
FOR WHATEVER REASON.

55:35.419 --> 55:36.724
THE BABY WAS IN THE CRIB.

55:36.768 --> 55:39.118
AND WE WERE A FEW FEET AWAY
IN OUR ROOM, SLEEPING.

55:39.161 --> 55:40.554
WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
OUR MONITOR ON!

55:40.598 --> 55:41.773
SOMETHING COULD
HAVE HAPPENED!

55:41.816 --> 55:43.296
PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE BABY
MONITORS THROUGHOUT

55:43.340 --> 55:45.298
THE ENTIRETY OF HUMAN HISTORY
UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO!

55:45.342 --> 55:47.039
AND BABIES DIED EVERY
NIGHT THEIR CRIBS!

55:47.082 --> 55:47.996
PENNY, PLEASE.

56:17.504 --> 56:18.853
DON'T YOU ASSHOLES
HAVE ANY CHILDREN?!

56:18.897 --> 56:20.464
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS ILLEGAL!

56:20.507 --> 56:21.508
DON'T BE STUPID.

56:21.552 --> 56:22.814
I'M GONNA SHUT THIS
OPERATION DOWN!

56:22.857 --> 56:23.902
THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOIN'!

56:23.945 --> 56:28.297
YOU CANNOT DO
CONSTRUCTION ON SUNDAY!

56:30.256 --> 56:32.084
OK, IT'S OK, MAN.

56:32.127 --> 56:33.477
WE'VE ALL BEEN
IN YOUR SHOES. YOU KNOW?

56:33.520 --> 56:36.741
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME,
TRUST ME, MORE THAN ONCE.

56:36.784 --> 56:38.438
YOU TIED ONE ON SATURDAY NIGHT,

56:38.482 --> 56:41.093
INDUCED YOURSELF
INTO A JUNIOR COMA,

56:41.136 --> 56:43.269
AND YOU LOST AN ENTIRE DAY.

56:43.312 --> 56:46.490
WELCOME TO MONDAY.

56:49.667 --> 56:52.365
IF YOU GOT A SICK DAY,
I THINK I'D CALL IN.

56:52.409 --> 56:55.237
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE MORE SHUT EYE.

56:55.281 --> 56:58.066
WHY DON'T YOU GO
CRAWL BACK IN BED.

56:58.110 --> 57:01.156
I'LL MAKE SURE
WE KEEP IT DOWN.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.727
Alex: YOU HAVE TO GET
OUT RIGHT NOW.

57:49.770 --> 57:50.771
DO YOU HEAR ME?

57:50.815 --> 57:52.251

57:53.470 --> 57:54.601

57:54.645 --> 57:55.689
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

57:55.733 --> 57:56.995
GOD DAMN IT, WHY WON'T
YOU BELIEVE ME?

57:57.038 --> 57:58.387
YOU THINK THIS
ISN'T HARD FOR ME?

57:58.431 --> 58:02.783
WAKE UP!
WHY ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

58:52.920 --> 58:55.444
I'M SORRY.

58:55.749 --> 59:00.275
I DIDN'T PICTURE OUR
LIFE QUITE LIKE THIS.

59:00.841 --> 59:03.452
YOU MUST HATE IT.

59:07.848 --> 59:10.503
THE RAIN IS NICE.

59:10.547 --> 59:13.462
THEY'LL PROBABLY
HAVE TO STOP.

59:16.378 --> 59:19.643
ISN'T THE RAIN NICE?

59:27.955 --> 59:31.480
I CAN'T REMEMBER
YOUR NAME.

59:35.746 --> 59:38.313
I'M SORRY.

59:45.756 --> 59:47.279
YOU SEE HER, TOO.

THE BABY'S ASLEEP.

01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:20.529
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE REALIZED,

01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:22.619
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
QUIET RIGHT NOW.

01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:25.056
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE
WE MOVED IN THIS PLACE

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:26.753
THAT I CAN ACTUALLY
GET SOME WORK DONE.

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:29.451

YOU HAVE GOT TO LET ME

01:00:45.859 --> 01:00:46.904
ALL YOU CAN
THINK ABOUT IS WORK

WHEN WE'RE IN THE FIFTH
LEVEL OF HELL?

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.691

THIS IS FOR YOU.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.694
DIFFICULT? WHAT IS WRONG

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.696
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

IT'S NOT REAL.

I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.758
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THESE.

01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:15.933

WE ARE FALLING APART.

01:01:19.284 --> 01:01:21.547
WE CANNOT FUNCTION
LIKE THIS.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.244
I CAN HELP YOU.

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:24.202
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:25.725
I COULD TAKE CARE OF TANNER.NO--

I HAVE TO BE HERE
TO PROTECT HIM.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:30.730
THEN SOMETHING'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:34.125
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE
GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:36.170
GOD, I WANT TO GO HOME.

01:01:36.214 --> 01:01:37.432
I WANT TO GO HOME.

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:41.654
YOU JUST NEED
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:44.396

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:50.576
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:52.709
STAY AWAY FROM YOU?

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:56.451
ALL I'VE EVER DONE IS TAKEN
CARE OF YOU AND THE BABY.

01:01:56.495 --> 01:01:57.409
THE BABY?

01:01:57.452 --> 01:01:58.671
YOU WANTED THIS BABY
JUST AS MUCH

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.542
AS YOU WANTED TO
MOVE INTO THIS HOUSE.

01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:01.413
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:02:01.456 --> 01:02:02.283
YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

01:02:02.327 --> 01:02:03.720
YOU THINK
I'M STUPID, HUH?

01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:06.244
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE THIS!

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:08.420
I SAID STAY AWAY FROM ME.

01:02:08.463 --> 01:02:09.595
I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU.

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:11.031

HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:07.740
ARE YOU FEELING
ANYTHING?

01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:17.097
THAT SMELLS GOOD.

01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:19.926
