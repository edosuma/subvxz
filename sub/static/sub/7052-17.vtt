00:13.530 --> 00:15.930
# So Nellie the elephant packed her trunk # 

00:15.930 --> 00:18.430
# And said good-bye to the circus # 

00:18.430 --> 00:20.760
# Off she went with a trumpetey-trump # 

00:20.760 --> 00:25.630
# Trump, trump, trump # 

00:25.630 --> 00:28.300
# The head of the herd was calling # 

00:28.300 --> 00:31.260
# Far, far away # 

00:31.260 --> 00:34.000
# They meet one night in silver light # 

00:34.000 --> 00:39.360
# They meet one night in silver light # 

00:41.560 --> 00:44.560
Evening, little lady.

00:44.560 --> 00:48.160
# So Nellie the elephant packed her trunk # 

00:48.160 --> 00:50.860
# Off she went with a trumpety-trump # 

00:50.860 --> 00:54.600
# Trump, trump, trump # 

00:54.600 --> 00:58.230
# The head of the herd was calling # 

00:58.230 --> 01:00.960
# Far, far away # 

01:19.200 --> 01:24.400
Baby, we're gonna run.

01:31.260 --> 01:33.860
Damn it!

01:33.860 --> 01:38.930
Mommy didn't say that.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.560
Oh... it'll fly away, baby.

02:04.730 --> 02:06.700
# The head of the herd was calling # 

02:06.700 --> 02:08.630
# Far, far away # 

02:08.630 --> 02:10.900
# So Nellie the elephant packed her trunk # 

02:10.900 --> 02:13.730
# And said good-bye to the circus # 

02:13.730 --> 02:16.160
# Off she went with a trumpety-trump # 

02:16.160 --> 02:19.200
# Trump, trump, trump # 

02:24.400 --> 02:29.930
It's our lucky day, baby.

02:29.930 --> 02:34.130
Here it comes.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.430
Oh...

03:13.060 --> 03:14.360
We have a low-pressure center here,

03:14.360 --> 03:16.860
backed up with a cold front coming across the east.

03:16.860 --> 03:20.100
And then, here in the west, we've got a high-pressure ridge

03:20.100 --> 03:21.800
coming in with a warm front that's descending

03:21.800 --> 03:23.800
across the western part of the country...

03:23.800 --> 03:27.300
I always hated you could do that.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.430
I always hated that you could date two guys

03:28.430 --> 03:29.760
at the same time.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.730
Really, Liv? What time did you wake up?

03:33.730 --> 03:35.000
Are you okay?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.700
Aunt Liv, I'm getting vascinations.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.630
"vaccinations."

03:38.630 --> 03:40.360
Come on, baby, go get dressed.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.830
They put something dead inside you. Dead!

03:43.830 --> 03:46.830
Into your blood. Gruesome.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.330
Ella Jae, please go get dressed.

03:48.330 --> 03:49.930
Yes.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.460
"Gruesome."

03:52.460 --> 03:55.260
- Gruesome?  - That's a good word.

03:55.260 --> 03:56.800
And in other news, a suicide

03:56.800 --> 03:58.360
on the New York subway system last night

03:58.360 --> 04:01.130
got rush hour off to a slow start this morning.

04:01.130 --> 04:03.330
Risa Pears, a New York City school teacher

04:03.330 --> 04:05.000
and mother of an 18-month-old daughter

04:05.000 --> 04:07.430
flung herself in front of an oncoming train last night

04:07.430 --> 04:08.900
while returning home from the circus.

04:08.900 --> 04:09.900
Subway service between...

04:32.800 --> 04:35.360
I want permission to go to New York

04:35.360 --> 04:37.330
to investigate a case.

04:37.330 --> 04:38.830
What is it?

04:38.830 --> 04:41.800
A suicide on the subway.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.830
I read about it in the paper this morning.

04:43.830 --> 04:46.030
How exactly is this a case?

04:46.030 --> 04:48.700
I believe that the woman may have been murdered.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.260
There may have been extraordinary circumstances.

04:51.260 --> 04:55.800
What kind of extraordinary circumstances?

04:55.800 --> 04:56.930
I'm listening.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.030
Uh...

05:00.030 --> 05:02.030
That's all I'm comfortable saying

05:02.030 --> 05:05.400
at the moment, sir.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.100
Dunham, are you all right?

05:07.100 --> 05:10.260
For the last few weeks you've seemed... distracted.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.730
on edge.

05:11.730 --> 05:16.000
I haven't been sleeping very well.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.660
I wouldn't be asking if this wasn't important.

05:18.660 --> 05:22.030
Dunham, you're a crucial part of this operation.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.260
You're very valuable to me.

05:23.260 --> 05:27.060
Thank you.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.760
24 hours.

05:30.760 --> 05:34.060
Then I want you back on the job, head clear.

05:34.060 --> 05:37.230
Thank you.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.430
Olivia, it was a nightmare.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.800
It felt like I was really there.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.360
No, you were asleep in your bed.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.260
Wait a minute.

05:53.260 --> 05:57.930
Have you experienced any nausea, Agent Dunham?

05:57.930 --> 05:59.660
Rashes, hair loss...

05:59.660 --> 06:01.960
- even a strand or two on the pillow?  - No.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.360
Any pain urinating, or blood?

06:04.360 --> 06:05.760
I don't think you're helping 

06:05.760 --> 06:08.130
- Is that a...  - Yeah, a geiger counter.

06:08.130 --> 06:11.430
Not a rad.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.760
I thought you might have teleported to New York

06:13.760 --> 06:17.030
in your sleep and killed her.

06:17.030 --> 06:18.560
Wouldn't that have been wondrous?

06:18.560 --> 06:22.960
But even the most controlled matter to energy transmutation

06:22.960 --> 06:25.530
leaves behind some background radiation.

06:25.530 --> 06:28.960
So ergo, you are not actually there.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.860
Great, well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.300
- Astral...  - Astrid.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.360
Projection.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.400
A spirit walk, as it were.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.060
No, no, no, you wouldn't have had

06:44.060 --> 06:46.730
sufficient corporeal form to interact

06:46.730 --> 06:47.830
with the young woman.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.030
Here we go.

06:49.030 --> 06:50.560
It's like listening to a broken record,

06:50.560 --> 06:52.430
but the lyrics keep on changing.

06:52.430 --> 06:54.030
She had a bad dream.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.000
No, I could smell the platform.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.760
I saw her baby staring at me.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.200
I saw her face before I saw the news.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.330
How is that possible?

07:02.330 --> 07:03.900
Opium?

07:03.900 --> 07:07.630
It wasn't just a dream.

07:07.630 --> 07:12.360
Was it?

07:12.360 --> 07:16.260
New York it is.

07:18.100 --> 07:21.330
I love New York.

07:21.330 --> 07:26.000
Oh, we could catch a show!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.330
Pippin!

07:27.330 --> 07:29.960
Uh... no.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.530
# Cats fit on the windowsill # 

07:33.530 --> 07:34.630
# Children fit in the snow # 

07:34.630 --> 07:36.100
Walter, you're staying here.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.400
I'll make it up to you.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.130
# Why do I feel like # 

07:41.130 --> 07:44.430
# I don't fit in anywhere I go # ?

07:44.430 --> 07:46.400
That is the Jackson Five, right?

07:46.400 --> 07:51.400
Hmm?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.430
Absolutely.

08:01.130 --> 08:03.900
- She said to meet her at the clock.  - There she is.

08:09.130 --> 08:10.900
You the two?

08:10.900 --> 08:13.430
Uh, Dunham, Bishop. FBI.

08:13.430 --> 08:15.730
You know, you shouldn't eat those.

08:15.730 --> 08:18.030
About 30 years too late on that.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.700
Can you show us where this actually happened?

08:20.700 --> 08:23.560
Yep. Let's go.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.630
- Are we safe?  - Sorry?

08:27.630 --> 08:29.400
FBI comes into my house,

08:29.400 --> 08:31.500
First thing I need to ask is "Are we safe?"

08:31.500 --> 08:33.600
I'm not sure we're ever really safe.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.360
We're as safe as houses.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.460
What can you tell us about this suicide?

08:37.460 --> 08:39.000
Just like it said in the papers,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.559
Risa Pears, 28, decided to take a header

08:41.559 --> 08:43.159
in front of the seven train.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.660
So what makes you think that it was a suicide?

08:45.660 --> 08:47.630
Security cameras got it all.

08:47.630 --> 08:49.860
I'd like to take a look at that tape myself.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.000
All right, we'll set you up, Agent.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.600
What, exactly, are we looking for here?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.530
Humor me.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.260
There's gonna be a balloon floating on the ceiling.

09:01.260 --> 09:04.660
A red one.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.430
The husband was away on business in Seattle.

09:17.430 --> 09:19.160
He just flew back in.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.660
He's giving a statement down at the station.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.800
Come on, this doesn't fit the profile.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.100
Married, a baby.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.030
You don't take your kid to the circus

09:28.030 --> 09:29.600
and then give him a front-row seat

09:29.600 --> 09:32.700
to watch you kill yourself.

09:32.700 --> 09:37.630
And then there's that.

09:37.630 --> 09:41.400
Yeah.

09:44.230 --> 09:47.830
This doesn't make any sense.

09:47.830 --> 09:53.430
She'd been waiting to go to the circus.

09:53.430 --> 09:55.960
And she's from here.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.360
We met in Chicago.

09:57.360 --> 10:03.000
She kept saying that she wanted to take Lucy to the circus.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.100
Okay?

10:06.100 --> 10:10.330
She used to sing you this song about elephants.

10:10.330 --> 10:13.860
We were happy.

10:13.860 --> 10:17.300
She wouldn't kill herself.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.860
You've gotta believe me.

10:19.860 --> 10:24.100
She would never kill herself.

10:28.030 --> 10:31.330
Agent, the surveillance you wanted is ready.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.030
Thank you.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.300
Sh... she wouldn't do it.

10:41.300 --> 10:44.130
She just wouldn't.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.560
Thank you.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.960
Mm-hmm.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.260
This is the digital backup.

11:06.260 --> 11:09.530
The primary drive is in evidence.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.660
Can you slow this down? 

11:16.900 --> 11:19.260
- Just start at the top.  - Mhm-hmn.

11:31.860 --> 11:35.160
Can I get a copy of this?

11:39.430 --> 11:41.500
See, it doesn't make any sense.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.760
I remember things from the crime scene.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.960
I remember pushing her.

11:44.960 --> 11:50.230
You know dreams aren't always literal.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.260
Perhaps you killed this young woman

11:52.260 --> 11:54.200
in some less-direct way.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.100
We just watched her kill herself.

11:57.100 --> 12:00.630
Perhaps you compelled her to jump using your mind.

12:00.630 --> 12:02.030
Do you have any reason to want her dead?

12:02.030 --> 12:03.300
Romantic rival, perhaps?  

12:03.300 --> 12:05.030
- What?  - I didn't even know her. 

12:05.030 --> 12:06.960
- Then why did you kill her?  - I don't know.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.600
Stop, both of you. Stop.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.330
Nobody killed anybody.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.600
I'm surprised at you, Peter.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.430
Agent Dunham is your friend.

12:13.430 --> 12:17.030
You trust her. She says she killed that girl.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.700
Are you presumptuous to believe her

12:18.700 --> 12:20.600
only when she says what you want to hear?

12:20.600 --> 12:24.660
Your mother was a bit like that. Consider this question.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.200
What is mankind's oldest dream?

12:27.200 --> 12:29.630
- World peace?  - Oh, hardly.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.030
It's a social construct imposed by an awareness

12:31.030 --> 12:32.400
of our own mortality.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.560
Should have gone with "great taste, less filling."

12:34.560 --> 12:37.530
What is the greatest desire of the weak and the subjugated?

12:37.530 --> 12:39.530
Of the man whose fire is stolen

12:39.530 --> 12:42.160
by an opponent whose only advantage is

12:42.160 --> 12:43.530
the luck of superior size.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.830
We're stealing fire?

12:44.830 --> 12:46.630
I think we're cavemen in this story.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.860
Whose woman is wrenched away by brutality and force.

12:49.860 --> 12:51.660
Sexist cavemen at that.

12:51.660 --> 12:55.300
Simple. To kill with thought.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.230
To wish someone dead.

12:57.230 --> 13:00.060
To murder with the mind.

13:00.060 --> 13:02.200
Come on, that's ridiculous.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.730
You're right, I'm sure.

13:08.030 --> 13:13.430
Unless, of course, it happens again.

14:17.230 --> 14:19.830
- Why would you do that?  - What?

14:19.830 --> 14:20.960
Come on.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.160
Do you think it's okay

14:22.160 --> 14:23.700
to just flirt with her like that?

14:23.700 --> 14:24.800
Honey, honey, please.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.200
- What is it... I'm not young enough?  - Honey, is there something wrong?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.830
- I'm not sexy enough anymore?  - Honey, would you relax?

14:29.830 --> 14:32.000
What is the matter with you?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.430
- You bastard.  - Just calm down.

14:34.430 --> 14:37.960
You bastard! You cheating bastard! I can't stand the way you looking at her.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.430
You cheating bastard!

14:39.430 --> 14:43.500
Uhh! Uhh!

15:07.900 --> 15:10.260
Charlie. Charlie, it's me.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.260
There's been a murder. 

15:15.060 --> 15:18.260
- I tried to kill him.  - I have a half-dozen witnesses' statements say

15:18.260 --> 15:19.300
She stabbed her husband.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.400
- Yes, I was there.  - No. You were 300 miles away.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.930
Somehow I'm killing these people in my dreams.

15:25.930 --> 15:28.530
Hello. Agent Olivia Dunham.

15:28.530 --> 15:30.560
- This is Peter Bishop.  - Hi.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.860
So what can you tell us, doctor?

15:32.860 --> 15:35.160
The damage was quite severe.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.700
Upper and lower intestines both shredded.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.530
She essentially gutted him.

15:39.530 --> 15:40.800
He's gonna die.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.760
That's why they gave her permission to be here.

15:47.030 --> 15:52.600
So your name is Mouse?

15:52.600 --> 15:56.160
Nickname. From college.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.800
I'm quiet... I guess.

15:59.800 --> 16:06.230
Maybe just... tell us what you remember.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.530
We were at dinner.

16:07.530 --> 16:11.400
Tuesdays we go out.

16:11.400 --> 16:16.860
We decided Italian.

16:16.860 --> 16:19.800
I don't know what happened.

16:19.800 --> 16:25.060
I just...

16:25.060 --> 16:28.960
It doesn't make any sense.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.960
Billy's devoted to me.

16:31.960 --> 16:37.900
Suddenly, I knew he was gonna leave me.

16:39.630 --> 16:45.600
I was convinced of it.

16:45.600 --> 16:51.200
And I got so... scared.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.930
I got so angry.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.300
How could I do this?

16:56.300 --> 16:59.200
Maybe you didn't mean to hurt him.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.260
I mean, maybe somebody made you do it.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.960
- Like, compelled you.  - Agent Dunham?

17:02.960 --> 17:05.430
I mean, did it feel like there was

17:05.430 --> 17:07.430
Someone else in your head making you stab him?

17:07.430 --> 17:11.800
I tried to kill my husband, right?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.859
- How is this happening to me?  - Olivia!

17:13.859 --> 17:15.460
- Oh, god.  - Okay...

17:15.460 --> 17:17.130
Agent Dunham, I need to talk to you right now.

17:17.130 --> 17:21.260
It wasn't you.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.030
Olivia, what, exactly, do you think you're doing?

17:25.030 --> 17:27.130
I made her do it, Peter.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.030
You're running on no sleep.

17:29.030 --> 17:32.500
And if I'm right, caffeine pills.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.900
I faked my way through grad school, remember?

17:34.900 --> 17:38.500
You need to calm down.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.560
You're not thinking straight,

17:39.560 --> 17:41.430
And you're not making any sense.

17:41.430 --> 17:45.430
Peter...

17:45.430 --> 17:48.160
What is happening to me?

17:48.160 --> 17:51.400
Hey...

17:58.430 --> 18:00.200
- Wow. We're closed.  - FBI.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.160
Great. Fun times.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.360
So what can you tell me about what happened here last night?

18:05.360 --> 18:08.130
I got nothing new for you, fbi.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.430
Humor me.

18:09.430 --> 18:10.900
Sure. Middle of dinner,

18:10.900 --> 18:12.730
Bitch gets up and stabs her husband.

18:12.730 --> 18:15.360
Bitch? Really? We got a problem here?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.860
Problem? Yeah, we got a problem.

18:17.860 --> 18:18.960
People rush out last night in the middle of dinner.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.400
No one pays.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.130
Today I'm out all of lunch hour.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.860
Oh, yeah, also, I'm on the cover of the Post.

18:24.860 --> 18:26.760
Who was sitting here?

18:26.760 --> 18:27.960
Lady, this isn't the Palm.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.900
We don't keep a seating chart.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.100
- Who was it?  - Whoa! Whoa!

18:31.100 --> 18:33.300
Was I there? Was it me?

18:33.300 --> 18:36.030
- Agent Dunham.  - Just some guy.

18:36.030 --> 18:37.600
He comes in every now and then.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.330
Blond hair. He's got a scar on his face.

18:40.330 --> 18:42.900
I know who that is.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.100
What the hell is wrong with you?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.260
You think you can do whatever you want?

18:45.260 --> 18:48.130
What are you, crazy? I'll sue you guys.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Olivia, stop. What is wrong with you?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.160
That man that he described, I've seen him before.

18:56.160 --> 19:01.030
What? Where?

19:04.530 --> 19:06.060
That's a curious word.

19:06.060 --> 19:08.700
So it's got nothing to do with going underwater?

19:08.700 --> 19:12.030
No. "unsub" stands for unidentified subject.

19:12.030 --> 19:14.330
Actually, it should more logically mean

19:14.330 --> 19:15.460
Going above water.

19:15.460 --> 19:16.700
And still no.

19:16.700 --> 19:19.530
I certainly hope we find him.

19:19.530 --> 19:21.360
Who we looking for?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.560
I think it's after this.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.660
Remarkable. This is entirely new.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.530
What?

19:27.530 --> 19:28.960
You're talking about the coffee.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.960
Mm, yes. What is it?

19:30.960 --> 19:33.130
- Cinnamon?  - Yes.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.600
It's quite good. Delightful, really.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.300
There.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.600
Blond hear, a scar.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.600
And he was at both crime scenes.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.730
So he's our link.

19:43.730 --> 19:46.230
Interesting.

19:46.230 --> 19:48.560
No, not the coffee.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.830
Although I was wondering if we can...

19:49.830 --> 19:52.060
Walter? Please.

19:52.060 --> 19:56.230
Well, you say he was at the table

19:56.230 --> 19:58.260
Where you dreamt you were sitting,

19:58.260 --> 19:59.900
And he was on the platform where you 

19:59.900 --> 20:01.060
- dreamt you were standing.  - Yes.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.800
And in your dreams you got many of

20:03.800 --> 20:05.100
the actual details correct. 

20:05.100 --> 20:07.100
- Is that right?  - Yes.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.700
But you did not see him in your dreams.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.630
No, I didn't.

20:11.630 --> 20:15.760
Well, perhaps that's because you were him.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.500
As I said, dreams are not always literal.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.530
What if you weren't dreaming about yourself,

20:22.530 --> 20:24.830
You were dreaming about him...

20:24.830 --> 20:27.560
Mr. Unsub?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.000
So he's the one

20:29.000 --> 20:31.430
That's been doing these things to these people, not me?

20:31.430 --> 20:33.030
That's a possible explanation.

20:33.030 --> 20:36.130
But why would I be dreaming of him?

20:36.130 --> 20:41.130
I mean, who is he?

20:46.360 --> 20:48.530
Government armed forces database is online.

20:48.530 --> 20:51.930
Interpol and public health systems online.

20:51.930 --> 20:53.200
We can match a partial from the restaurant.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.230
To one off the guard rail at the subway station.

20:57.230 --> 21:00.400
Running facial recognition software.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.630
Agents.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.230
What, precisely, is going on here?

21:06.230 --> 21:08.300
Sir...

21:08.300 --> 21:10.300
An unsub that may be killing people with his thoughts

21:10.300 --> 21:12.000
While Olivia is watching in her dream.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.100
Uh, by the way, I don't think this machine works.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.800
- Agent Dunham.  - I've got a hit.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.700
Suspect's name is Nick Wayne.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.700
Uh, former address is St. Jude's mental hospital.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.360
I'm not going there.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.660
I have a lawsuit from a restaurant in, New York.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.300
I have unauthorized allocation

21:41.300 --> 21:42.960
Of agency time and resources.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.560
I have access of government databases for personal use.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.430
What's going on?

21:49.430 --> 21:51.260
Someone's been coming into my dreams.

21:51.260 --> 21:55.160
And he's either been making me kill people,

21:55.160 --> 21:59.130
Or he's been killing people and making me watch.

22:01.130 --> 22:05.700
You know how this sounds?

22:05.700 --> 22:10.030
These things... these things that we see every day,

22:10.030 --> 22:13.600
These things that we investigate...

22:13.600 --> 22:15.430
They're happening to me.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.360
Dunham, you understand what kind of scrutiny we're under?

22:22.360 --> 22:24.260
You're under?

22:24.260 --> 22:26.160
If Sanford Harris weren't in washington...

22:26.160 --> 22:27.460
I know.

22:27.460 --> 22:28.530
You can't unofficially investigate a case

22:28.530 --> 22:29.660
Where you're the subject.

22:29.660 --> 22:32.730
I'm sorry.

22:36.730 --> 22:42.060
Dunham, why didn't you come to me?

22:42.060 --> 22:45.830
I should have.

22:45.830 --> 22:50.430
But I didn't want to sound crazy.

22:50.430 --> 22:53.160
So maybe...

22:53.160 --> 22:56.100
Maybe it's better if I just take some time off...

22:56.100 --> 22:58.760
Just a few days... to work this out.

22:58.760 --> 23:02.700
Maybe just take a short leave.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.660
I need to do this.

23:15.930 --> 23:21.500
Agent Francis, we have a status change.

23:21.500 --> 23:25.000
I'm opening a new case. Subject's name is Nick Wayne.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.600
Agent Dunham is on point.

23:26.600 --> 23:31.500
Please give her whatever assistance she needs.

23:35.830 --> 23:39.230
Thank you.

23:41.900 --> 23:45.460
Dunham.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.960
Take care of yourself.

23:47.960 --> 23:52.060
I will.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.500
You know, until this year,

23:58.500 --> 23:59.930
I'd never actually been to a mental hospital.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.760
Learn to like new things.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.660
Maybe I never gave it enough thought...

24:04.660 --> 24:08.600
What Walter went through.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.530
I only every saw it from my own perspective.

24:11.530 --> 24:16.160
His being crazy was something he did to us.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.900
To my mother and me.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.960
It wasn't something that happened to him.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.860
Well, you were young.

24:26.860 --> 24:32.730
Well, I'm not young anymore.

24:32.730 --> 24:35.310
Must be a terrible thing to not

24:35.310 --> 24:37.900
be able to trust your own mind. 

24:37.900 --> 24:40.800
Yeah.

24:40.800 --> 24:45.730
Hey...

24:45.730 --> 24:48.860
Are you two the federal agents?

24:48.860 --> 24:51.700
Uh, yes. Agent Olivia Dunham.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.300
This is Peter Bishop.

24:53.300 --> 24:56.530
Dr. Miller. Come with me.

24:56.530 --> 24:58.500
I remember Nick very well.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.230
He was already a residential patient

25:00.230 --> 25:03.460
When I arrived here, which is about five years ago now.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.600
He had a very comprehensive insurance policy.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.360
Quite old. I'd never seen one like it.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.060
- What kind?  - Military.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.130
About four months ago an attorny arrived here

25:13.130 --> 25:15.000
With a paper saying that Nick had inherited

25:15.000 --> 25:16.560
A large sum of money.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.630
They met twice more, and after that,

25:18.630 --> 25:20.230
Nick checked himself out.

25:20.230 --> 25:22.260
He was here voluntarily, after all.

25:22.260 --> 25:25.600
Nick was an interesting person.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.160
He had a kind of brightness to him.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.530
Intelligent.

25:29.530 --> 25:31.900
Yes, quite, but not what I mean.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.900
He had an emotional brightness.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.830
If he was happy, he would light up a room.

25:37.830 --> 25:40.060
Sad, he was like a black hole

25:40.060 --> 25:42.600
That would suck you right down with him.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.900
Hyper-emotive is the clinical term.

25:44.900 --> 25:49.860
Put simply, his affect was highly infectious.

25:49.860 --> 25:51.330
- Was he dangerous?  - No.

25:51.330 --> 25:55.900
No, if anything, his ideation tended toward self-contempt.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.430
Toward the suicidal.

25:57.430 --> 26:00.100
Although he did suffer from some psychosis

26:00.100 --> 26:02.830
When his delusions were florid.

26:02.830 --> 26:04.500
What sort of delusions?

26:04.500 --> 26:07.930
Typical paranoid fare.

26:07.930 --> 26:11.600
Nick was convinced he'd been recruited as a child

26:11.600 --> 26:14.460
For a series of top-secret experiments.

26:14.460 --> 26:19.630
That he was being prepared to serve as a soldier

26:19.630 --> 26:23.100
In the coming war against denizens

26:23.100 --> 26:25.430
Of a parallel universe.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.160
"There is a war coming.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.400
Not a war of hatred and anger,

26:33.400 --> 26:34.960
a battle for survival.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.300
Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation

26:37.300 --> 26:38.660
are among us now.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.030
But before they can be considered soldiers,

26:41.030 --> 26:42.930
They must be regarded as recruits."

26:42.930 --> 26:44.530
It's all right here.

26:44.530 --> 26:46.900
He might as well have the ZFT memorized.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.800
But this is a manifesto from a terrorist cell in Germany.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.230
Yeah, ZFT... it translates as destruction

26:52.230 --> 26:53.760
By the advancement of technology.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.600
- It's their mission statement.  - Yeah, that's my point.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.560
You said Nick Lane's been in the nut farm for years, right?

26:58.560 --> 27:00.200
Well, the records go back to the mid '90s.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.760
So he's caused by ZFT for at least that long.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.760
So when did they recruit him?

27:04.760 --> 27:06.800
How old is he?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.160
What?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.200
Nick Lane. What year was he born?

27:10.200 --> 27:14.830
Uh, 1979.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.260
Where?

27:16.260 --> 27:20.960
Jacksonville, Florida.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.500
Aren't you from Jacksonville?

27:22.500 --> 27:25.530
We need to talk to your father.

27:25.530 --> 27:27.160
Why, what do you think you know?

27:27.160 --> 27:29.900
We need to talk to him now.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.400
Where's the fire?

27:33.400 --> 27:36.500
I always loved that expression, which is curious,

27:36.500 --> 27:41.660
Since my lab assistant was killed in a fire.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.260
What can you tell me about cortexiphan?

27:43.260 --> 27:45.060
Oh, that takes me back.

27:45.060 --> 27:48.030
I remember belly whipping up a peyote mash...

27:48.030 --> 27:51.900
Walter!

27:51.900 --> 27:57.500
Cortexiphan was a highly experimental drug.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.800
William theorized that it might enhance certain abilities

28:01.800 --> 28:04.730
In predisposed children.

28:04.730 --> 28:07.760
Let me guess... you experimented on people.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.730
Oh, no, no, not me.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.300
William.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.900
We had quite a disagreement about it.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.530
What abilities?

28:14.530 --> 28:15.900
It worked on perception.

28:15.900 --> 28:20.430
Carlos Castaneda, Aldous Huxley,

28:20.430 --> 28:22.260
Werner Heisenberg,

28:22.260 --> 28:27.200
All focused on one single elementary truth.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.600
Perception is the key to transformation.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.560
Reality is both subjective and malleable.

28:32.560 --> 28:33.910
If you can dream a better world,

28:33.910 --> 28:35.100
you can make a better world.

28:35.100 --> 28:39.030
Or perhaps travel between them.

28:39.030 --> 28:40.330
What did you just say?

28:40.330 --> 28:45.830
So if Nick Lane was treated with cortexiphan,

28:45.830 --> 28:49.460
He could change reality with his thoughts.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.960
He could make somebody do something

28:51.960 --> 28:53.100
Just by thinking it.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.630
Not his thoughts.

28:54.630 --> 28:57.200
It's how you feel that determines

28:57.200 --> 28:58.830
Your view of the world.

28:58.830 --> 29:00.960
You're saying that cortexiphan worked on feelings.

29:00.960 --> 29:04.600
That's reductive, but essentially, yes.

29:04.600 --> 29:08.500
What if Nick Lane...

29:08.500 --> 29:10.330
Wasn't affecting people with his thoughts?

29:10.330 --> 29:12.430
What if he was affecting them with his emotions?

29:12.430 --> 29:17.300
The psychiatrist said that he was suicidal, right?

29:17.300 --> 29:19.730
They said that his moods were contagious.

29:19.730 --> 29:21.560
What if he was on the platform because

29:21.560 --> 29:23.200
He was considering killing himself?

29:23.200 --> 29:24.660
Oh, my...

29:24.660 --> 29:27.200
Look, at the restaurant, all happy couples.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.530
It triggers his own fear of abandonment.

29:29.530 --> 29:31.730
And that woman caught his mood.

29:31.730 --> 29:33.130
For the sake of argument, let's say that

29:33.130 --> 29:35.560
Nick's emotions are contagious, like a virus.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.460
Maybe he's even doing this unwittingly.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.730
But it still doesn't explain how it is you're seeing him

29:39.730 --> 29:41.200
In your dreams.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.330
If William had followed the usual procedures...

29:45.330 --> 29:48.200
You see,

29:48.200 --> 29:51.160
Often when we experimented on children...

29:51.160 --> 29:53.330
Okay, can we just stop right there

29:53.330 --> 29:54.860
And analyze that sentence for a second?

29:54.860 --> 29:56.800
We would put them in pairs.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.260
Like the buddy system in summer camp

29:59.260 --> 30:00.130
Listen to him!

30:00.130 --> 30:02.400
He's comparing human experimentation to summer camp!

30:02.400 --> 30:06.460
This pairing kept them from becoming frightened

30:06.460 --> 30:09.460
Or feeling isolated.

30:09.460 --> 30:14.600
Sometimes an intense bond could form.

30:16.530 --> 30:19.600
A bond...

30:19.600 --> 30:22.030
Which could be greatly amplified by a drug

30:22.030 --> 30:25.130
Like cortexiphan.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.830
Stop it, both of you.

30:40.830 --> 30:42.100
You're creeping me out.

30:42.100 --> 30:46.360
Olivia was never treated with cortexiphan.

30:48.730 --> 30:51.960
Is that true, Agent Dunham?

31:01.130 --> 31:03.100
I might have been.

31:03.100 --> 31:07.100
What?

31:07.100 --> 31:09.260
Well, that's good news.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.930
How is that good news, Walter?

31:11.930 --> 31:17.200
This Nick Lane of yours...

31:17.200 --> 31:21.760
It means I may know how to find him.

32:55.330 --> 33:00.200
He's sexually excited.

33:00.200 --> 33:04.630
His excitement has infected the dancer.

33:04.630 --> 33:07.300
She's excited too.

33:07.300 --> 33:11.630
They're leaving the club together.

33:11.630 --> 33:14.100
What, are you nuts, ginger?!

33:14.100 --> 33:16.030
You're in the middle of your shift!

33:16.030 --> 33:17.830
What's going on?

33:17.830 --> 33:21.200
Shh.

33:21.230 --> 33:24.200
I'm lypnotically stimulating R.E.M. state

33:24.230 --> 33:26.900
To enhance her psychic connection to Nick Lane.

33:26.900 --> 33:30.300
We're tuning her antenna, as it were.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.830
Olivia can feel what Nick Lane is feeling.

33:32.830 --> 33:34.730
She can see what he's seeing.

33:34.730 --> 33:36.060
Oh...

33:36.060 --> 33:37.730
What's happening? Is he hurting her?

33:37.730 --> 33:39.360
Oh.

33:39.360 --> 33:42.860
Oh...

33:42.860 --> 33:44.360
What?

33:46.700 --> 33:49.100
Oh, I see.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.160
He's feeling guilt.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.500
Shame.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.659
He feels dirty.

34:08.659 --> 34:13.560
He hates himself.

34:13.560 --> 34:18.100
He wishes he was dead.

34:18.100 --> 34:21.400
The dancer...

34:21.400 --> 34:25.800
He's infecting her.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.300
She's catching it.

34:27.300 --> 34:31.300
His emotions are jumping to her.

34:31.300 --> 34:36.000
How much he hates himself.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.199
The girl... he's infecting her.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.830
She's dead. I killed her.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.260
No, no, you didn't.

35:03.260 --> 35:06.600
You must stay under.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.100
Agent Dunham, you must try to stay under.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.330
- She must try to stay under.  - What is going on?

35:11.330 --> 35:13.460
Did he just kill someone? Did he kill that dancer?

35:13.460 --> 35:15.000
These are dreams.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.230
This boy is essentially a reverse empath.

35:18.230 --> 35:22.530
His feelings are killing people.

35:22.530 --> 35:24.430
Put simply, Agent Dunham's mind

35:24.430 --> 35:28.200
Is recognizing the effects of his emotions on his victims,

35:28.200 --> 35:30.330
And translating them into images

35:30.330 --> 35:32.460
That her dreaming mind can recognize.

35:32.460 --> 35:35.000
Put simply.

35:39.130 --> 35:42.100
Peter...

35:42.100 --> 35:44.430
Help her.

35:44.430 --> 35:49.060
Help her calm down. Go ahead, son.

36:03.030 --> 36:05.360
Agent Dunh...

36:05.360 --> 36:07.860
Where are you?

36:07.860 --> 36:11.400
Where are you? What can you see?

36:11.400 --> 36:14.030
What can you see?

36:22.130 --> 36:27.060
Agent Dunham...

36:27.060 --> 36:32.060
Where are you?

36:33.330 --> 36:36.430
I know where he lives.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.960
Clear!

37:50.960 --> 37:54.030
Clear.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.900
Come over here.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.700
I think you should take a look at this.

38:41.500 --> 38:45.230
The torrent attack.

38:45.230 --> 38:47.700
Someone's been a busy bee.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.460
Look at the dates on these papers.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.100
This guy's been collecting this stuff for years.

38:52.100 --> 38:53.330
I've always wanted a two-headed goat.

38:53.330 --> 38:55.800
What newspaper is this? Can I get a subscription?

38:55.800 --> 38:57.400
Why now?

38:57.400 --> 39:00.600
He was given cortexiphan over 20 years ago, right?

39:00.600 --> 39:02.230
Why is this just happening now?

39:02.230 --> 39:04.700
That lawyer shows up at the mental hospital

39:04.700 --> 39:06.400
With a magical inheritance, and all of a sudden

39:06.400 --> 39:08.460
Nick Lane becomes an emotional atom bomb?

39:08.460 --> 39:09.960
Seems a little too coincidental

39:09.960 --> 39:11.360
to be coincidence in my book.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.360
So what are you saying?

39:13.360 --> 39:15.300
You think he was activated?

39:15.300 --> 39:18.130
"What was written will come to pass."

39:18.130 --> 39:20.960
What?

39:20.960 --> 39:24.330
It's written on the wall over here.

39:46.830 --> 39:49.260
Got a call from a security guard downtown.

39:49.260 --> 39:52.900
We've got a positive I.D. of Nick Lane entering a building.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.830
He's not alone.

40:03.500 --> 40:08.430
Nick Lane may be turning into a walking epidemic.

40:08.430 --> 40:10.060
As his emotions become more intense,

40:10.060 --> 40:12.300
They become more contagious.

40:12.300 --> 40:13.760
Great.

40:13.760 --> 40:16.600
Why can't "more angry" ever translate into "less dangerous"?

40:16.600 --> 40:18.930
What are we supposed to do if we find him, anyway?

40:18.930 --> 40:20.300
I mean, if we get too close to him,

40:20.300 --> 40:21.330
Aren't we gonna be infected with his emotions too?

40:21.330 --> 40:23.260
Yes.

40:23.260 --> 40:26.100
But perhaps Agent Dunham would not.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.600
Why?

40:28.600 --> 40:31.230
You were also treated with cortexiphan.

40:31.230 --> 40:33.900
It might afford you some degree of immunity

40:33.900 --> 40:36.430
From Nick's abilities.

40:36.430 --> 40:37.530
Why do I get the feeling

40:37.530 --> 40:40.460
You're not telling us everything?

40:40.460 --> 40:43.700
Because I don't know everything.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.030
Officer, we're with the FBI.

41:21.030 --> 41:22.560
Agent, you don't want to go up there.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.530
We already sent a guy up, now he's on the ledge too.

41:25.530 --> 41:27.330
We don't know what the hell's going on up there.

41:27.330 --> 41:30.560
Olivia...

41:30.560 --> 41:33.530
I'm gonna be okay.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.760
Nick?

42:01.760 --> 42:04.230
Nick Lane?

42:13.260 --> 42:15.530
Olive.

42:15.530 --> 42:16.760
You heard me.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.530
You heard me. You came.

42:19.530 --> 42:21.630
You were always the strong one.

42:21.630 --> 42:24.930
Whenever I got scared, you could make me feel better.

42:24.930 --> 42:26.430
Do you remember, Olive?

42:26.430 --> 42:30.600
I'm sorry, no, I don't.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.230
That's okay.

42:33.230 --> 42:35.900
I think they meant for us to forget.

42:35.900 --> 42:36.930
I just couldn't.

42:36.930 --> 42:42.360
I did what they told us. I waited, Olive.

42:42.360 --> 42:46.430
The soldier to come is both natural and unnatural.

42:46.430 --> 42:48.030
I waited to be called up.

42:48.030 --> 42:50.800
You stay fit, stay focused, stay ready.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.360
I wore the blacks and grays.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.060
I blended in.

42:54.060 --> 42:57.060
But the call never came.

42:57.060 --> 43:00.900
It never came.

43:00.900 --> 43:04.060
Then, that man with the glasses,

43:04.060 --> 43:06.000
He showed up at the hospital.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.500
He spoke all the old words.

43:08.500 --> 43:12.230
He said they're coming.

43:12.230 --> 43:13.930
He needed warriors.

43:13.930 --> 43:16.730
He said

43:16.730 --> 43:20.500
"what was written will come to pass."

43:20.500 --> 43:23.700
He said he knew how to wake me up.

43:23.700 --> 43:27.030
I shouldn't have listened to him.

43:27.030 --> 43:28.760
Sometimes what we wake up,

43:28.760 --> 43:32.060
It can't be put back to sleep.

43:32.060 --> 43:34.600
Nick, you don't have to do this.

43:34.600 --> 43:38.530
I want to stop hurting people!

43:42.130 --> 43:46.230
Take it.

43:46.230 --> 43:50.430
Take it.

43:50.430 --> 43:54.960
Shoot me.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.700
Please, Olive?

43:58.700 --> 44:01.260
I can't fight this much longer.

44:01.260 --> 44:04.430
Listen to me. Calm down...

44:04.430 --> 44:06.900
Aah!

44:06.900 --> 44:10.000
Uh, maybe...

44:11.000 --> 44:14.730
I do hope Agent Dunham meant to do that.

44:14.730 --> 44:16.600
Shoot me...

44:16.600 --> 44:21.060
Or I will jump, and they will all jump with me.

44:24.060 --> 44:27.630
Shoot me, Olive.

44:27.630 --> 44:32.530
I have to die or I will keep hurting people.

44:32.530 --> 44:35.430
Please.

44:35.430 --> 44:38.660
We weren't made for this.

44:38.660 --> 44:43.900
Don't make me take them all with me.

44:43.900 --> 44:45.800
Please?

44:54.800 --> 44:57.430
I'm sorry.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.930
Olive...

45:13.200 --> 45:15.830
You'll wish you had.

45:15.830 --> 45:18.760
You'll wish you'd killed me.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.730
Nick Lane's parents died several years ago.

45:31.730 --> 45:33.260
Car accident.

45:33.260 --> 45:35.160
His lawyer's identity appears to have been falsified.

45:35.160 --> 45:37.430
We've repeated our request to massive dynamic

45:37.430 --> 45:40.060
For information regarding the cortexiphan protocols.

45:40.060 --> 45:42.330
But according to Nina Sharp, the names of the participants

45:42.330 --> 45:44.900
Were deleted from the records.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.660
And you still have no memory of the trials,

45:46.660 --> 45:48.300
Of being treated with the drug?

45:48.300 --> 45:49.630
- No.  - But he does.

45:49.630 --> 45:52.260
Why do you think that is?

45:52.260 --> 45:55.260
I don't know.

45:55.260 --> 46:00.260
You saved his life.

46:00.260 --> 46:02.200
He's being kept in drug-induced coma.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.530
For how long?

46:04.530 --> 46:07.460
Indefinitely.

46:10.830 --> 46:12.700
He said sometimes what we wake up

46:12.700 --> 46:14.630
Can't be put back to sleep.

46:14.630 --> 46:18.730
I wonder if he was right.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.060
Are you all right, Dunham?

46:25.060 --> 46:27.530
Yes.

46:53.460 --> 46:56.660
Hey.

46:56.660 --> 46:58.700
Aunt Liv,

46:58.700 --> 47:01.800
The stuff that they put in me isn't dead anymore.

47:01.800 --> 47:07.060
It came back alive.

47:07.060 --> 47:09.100
Can that really happen?

47:09.100 --> 47:14.030
It's just bad dreams, baby girl.

47:15.500 --> 47:19.230
It's just bad dreams.
