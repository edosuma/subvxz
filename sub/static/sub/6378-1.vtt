WEBVTT

00:14.765 --> 00:16.471
Would you two shut up? I can't think.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.258
Andy, what the hell did you do?
There's someone inside.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.269
-Christ, what happened?
-You step back. I got it.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.101
-Andy's got it.
-I got it, I got it. Don't touch anything.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.688
-We were out trying to find Andy's car.
-Because someone fucking moved it.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.104
-Suddenly, there's this person in there.
-We need an ambulance.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.944
-Sam, call the cops.
-What? I am the cops.

00:35.118 --> 00:38.076
Oh, my God.
Please tell me it's not Lafayette, please.

00:38.247 --> 00:39.532
Check for a pulse.

00:39.957 --> 00:43.074
-Forget it. There ain't no pulse.
-What? Why?

00:44.127 --> 00:47.290
Because there ain't no heart. Sick fuck.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.830
It's not him. It's not Lafayette.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.049
Who the heck is that?

00:54.471 --> 00:55.460
-Demon.
-Hey.

02:28.357 --> 02:31.474
World '3 gone to shit. Nobody's got
no respect for authority no more.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.564
Wonder if she even knows.
Poor, sorry girl. What a train wreck.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.650
jesus Christ, Miss jeanette.
They’re gonna find out [knew her.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.612
Find out I went to her, find out everything.
Fuck, I pushed her. I cussed her out.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.903
Now look at her. Shit, what’s Mama
gonna say when she finds out?

02:44.081 --> 02:44.285
-There something else you ain't telling me?
-No. I've never seen that woman before.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.747
Can ’t believe we used to be friends.
I ’m gonna have to tell her everything.
-There something else you ain't telling me?
-No. I've never seen that woman before.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.661
-There something else you ain't telling me?
-No. I've never seen that woman before.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.542
Careful there, son.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.748
Her leg will break off like a chicken wing,
you hold her like that.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.041
--only adds to my expense.
Her leg will break off like a chicken wing,
you hold her like that.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.083
What sick fuck would dump a body
in a detective's car?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.421
Shit, I just got it detailed too.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.258
She knows I’m lying.
lsee it in her face.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.923
just keep it cool, Tara.
Don 't blink, don 't blink.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.767
Andy.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.262
Over here.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.521
Body's in full rigor mortis, Bud.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.904
Which is consistent with the vic
being killed elsewhere...

03:19.074 --> 03:22.282
...then brought here to the scene
some time in the past four hours...

03:22.452 --> 03:25.034
...since that's when I drove over here.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.995
Yeah.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.578
Andy, why don't you call it a night?
Your sister's waiting on you.

03:31.294 --> 03:35.788
Now? We've got a murder investigation.
You need your best detective on this.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.130
I know, Andy, but you clocked in at 8 am.
You're oven/vorked.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.927
You're also drunk.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.554
What?

03:44.725 --> 03:48.968
I am not oven/vorked.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.852
I don't know about you...

03:52.649 --> 03:55.812
...but I think I've seen
enough dead bodies to last me a lifetime.

03:55.986 --> 04:00.480
-You got enough light down there?
-Except this one, I just don't get.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.570
With everyone Rene killed,
you could see his rage.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.161
But this?
Cutting out that poor woman's heart?

04:08.832 --> 04:12.165
Someone just wanted to see her suffer.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.624
Every time I think I know what's what,
it turns out...

04:17.174 --> 04:19.335
...I don't know anything.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.124
Hey.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.385
I'm good to close up and go home
if you are.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.513
Sweetie, how did you know
the woman that got killed?

04:27.142 --> 04:29.724
Sookie, I told you, don't ev--

04:32.773 --> 04:34.183
That was--

04:34.357 --> 04:38.020
That was the woman
who gave me and my mama the exorcism.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.188
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

04:42.532 --> 04:46.616
You have to tell the police
about it. You know that.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.995
Shit.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.958
I'll probably have to spend all night
answering questions.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.291
My mama's gonna fall to pieces
when she finds out.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.550
Listen, you go home.
Sookie and I will close up.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.383
Kenya, I remembered something.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.344
Your bedtime will be at 4 am.
and not a minute later.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.559
-Whatever.
-And whilst you are under my roof...

05:16.733 --> 05:18.348
...hunting is completely forbidden.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.564
Like I'd know where to find people
in this bum-fuck town.

05:21.738 --> 05:25.401
-Are we even in a town?
-We also recycle in this house.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.193
Tru Blood and other glass items
go in the blue container...

05:29.371 --> 05:33.205
...and paper products
go in the white container.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.542
-Can I have one of those?
-No.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.250
-Hello?
-It's me.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.712
I'm gonna be a little late.
Something real awful happened out here.

05:44.886 --> 05:48.549
-l'/I tell you all about it when / see you.
-Do you need me? I can meet you.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.338
I always need you.

05:51.142 --> 05:55.431
But you just stay there.
It'll give me something to look fonNard to.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.853
-Take your time.
-Okay.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.487
Jessica, I'm gonna have a guest
coming over shortly.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.444
-Can we eat her?
-You may not.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.404
Well, who is she?

06:10.579 --> 06:12.945
-Is she your girlfriend?
-Yes.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.579
-Is she a vampire?
-No.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.875
Well, do I have to be nice to her?

06:19.045 --> 06:21.127
I need you to go upstairs
and get cleaned up.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.380
Remove your makeup,
make yourself presentable.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.212
-I will not have you looking like a slattern.
-A what?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.757
A lady of the evening.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.009
Awesome.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.640
"In the Acts of the Apostles,
chapter 26, verse 18...

06:37.814 --> 06:40.556
...Jesus informed Paul of his purpose:

06:40.734 --> 06:43.396
To open people '3 eyes,
turn them from darkness to light...

06:44.779 --> 06:46.610
...and from the power of Satan
unto God.

06:46.781 --> 06:50.365
If God is light, then Satan is darkness.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.618
If we human beings
are the children of God...

06:53.788 --> 06:57.121
...then creatures of darkness
are undoubtedly...

06:57.375 --> 07:00.333
...the children of Satan. "

07:29.741 --> 07:31.151
An exorcism?

07:31.326 --> 07:33.863
Last time it was a pig
in the middle of the road.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.450
Crazy-ass motherfucking Paul Bunyan pig,
if memory serves.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.865
-Plus, a naked woman.
-What the fuck?

07:40.043 --> 07:41.374
-Andy.
-That's what I saw.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.500
You know, you got quite an imagination.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.630
As far as we know,
her name's Nancy Levoir.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.712
And she's been a cashier
at De Soto's pharmacy over in Keachi...

07:49.886 --> 07:50.966
...for almost 20 years.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.514
The woman's got a voodoo bus
out in the woods.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.014
Any particular place in the woods?

07:56.851 --> 08:00.264
-Orjust the middle of the woods in general?
-Andy, sit down.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.225
Help us out, Tara.
You're the only one here who knows her.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.392
-She ended up dead outside your workplace.
-In your car.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.653
While you were there keeping me inside,
pouring me drink after drink after drink.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.860
What was it you didn't want me to see?

08:13.034 --> 08:16.401
Andy, a word with you in private.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.117
Don't go nowhere.
I know you're pulling something.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.836
-Okay, you're done for the night.
-I know what I'm doing.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.837
I got it under control.

08:28.008 --> 08:32.172
At best,
you're a material witness to a homicide.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.051
At worst, you could be a suspect.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.755
That is bullshit.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.970
-Either way, you can't stick your nose--
-Lord in heaven, sheriff.

08:40.145 --> 08:43.103
What did they do to Miss Jeanette?
Tell me!

08:44.691 --> 08:46.977
What did they do to her?

08:47.152 --> 08:48.858
I told you not to call her.

08:49.029 --> 08:53.272
-|t's a murder investigation.
-Tara, baby. Is it true?

08:53.491 --> 08:55.607
Is it Miss Jeanette?

09:06.171 --> 09:09.038
She saved my life.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.383
Mama, there was no Miss Jeanette.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.086
She was some woman
who worked in a pharmacy.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.846
All that stuff on the bus, it wasn't real.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.928
-Don't you lie.
-She told me so herself.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.093
You don't know
what you're talking about.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.559
She's just saying all this
because she's still angry with me.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.645
No. I mean, yes, but no, it's true.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.061
She gave me ipecac and peyote,
made me think I was killing my demon.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.775
No. No.

09:35.325 --> 09:39.785
It is a sin to speak ill of the dead like that.
She was a good woman.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.445
No, Mama, it was a scam.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.536
She stole from you and from me.
I'm so sorry.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.087
But she cured me.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.415
She cured me.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.168
I'm all right now, ain't I?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.168
Ain't I still right?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.085
Bucket.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.217
Bucket.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.587
Please. Please. I didn't do anything.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.748
I don't know anything. I swear.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.376
Please, don't kill me.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.341
No.No.No!

11:22.515 --> 11:25.598
What do you want from me? Tell me.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.349
What the fuck?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.519
Hey, where the hell are you going?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.402
You?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.996
Holy shit.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.704
-What the hell are you doing here?
-| wish I knew.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.795
Where the hell are we?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.460
Who are these people?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.717
Hey. Hey, what the fuck is going on?

12:00.887 --> 12:03.128
Will you shut your mouth,
you fucking inbreed?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.636
Where--? Where are they taking that guy?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.471
I don't know.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.560
But sometimes there are screams.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.144
Jesus fucking Christ.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.943
How long have you been here?

12:23.785 --> 12:26.322
I ain't got no idea.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.656
They tore out that poor woman's heart.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.534
I've never seen so much fear
on someone's face.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.965
I'm sorry you had to see that.

12:39.384 --> 12:44.048
I couldn't keep the voices out.
I was in too much shock to resist.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.679
There's just so....

12:47.100 --> 12:49.136
So much noise.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.184
This is the first quiet I've had all night.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.187
SooMe.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.235
I need to tell you something.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.862
No.

13:03.074 --> 13:06.566
Please, just shut up.

13:07.036 --> 13:11.325
Kiss me. Just make it go away
for just a little while.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.454
Well, hi there.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.834
You must be Sookie.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.543
Oh, Bill...

13:21.384 --> 13:24.217
...I love your shower.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.215
Mama, I'm sorry.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.889
I didn't wanna have to tell you
all that stuff.

13:34.272 --> 13:37.514
Because in spite of everything
you've done, there's some sick--

13:37.692 --> 13:41.059
Sick part of me
that can't bear to see you suffer.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.978
I thought if you found out
Miss Jeanette was a fraud--

13:44.157 --> 13:47.820
No, girl. There wasn't no fraud.

13:47.994 --> 13:54.991
I am living, breathing, thriving proof
there wasn't no fraud.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.456
I'm still healed.
Healed stronger than ever.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.620
-You are?
-The good Lord tested our faith...

14:00.798 --> 14:04.586
...by taking Miss Jeanette away from us.
I stayed true.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.170
I wish I could say the same
aboutyou,baby.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.173
-|'|| pray for you.
-Don't.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.933
I'm actually doing better than I have
in a long time.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.934
Well, let's pray for Miss Jeanette then.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.847
There's something evil out there
and it wanted her soul.

14:19.025 --> 14:22.267
You're not careful,
it's gonna come for yours too.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.609
Maryann.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.196
I came as soon as I heard.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.694
-Are you all right, sweetheart?
-Yeah.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.455
That's my mother.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.461
Ms. Thornton. Maryann Forrester.

14:42.632 --> 14:47.296
I've heard all about you.
What a rare opportunity this is.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.506
I've always wondered
what it would be like...

14:49.680 --> 14:53.264
...to gaze into the eyes of someone
so devoid of human compassion...

14:53.434 --> 14:57.097
...that she would abandon her own child
when she needed you most.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.556
What?

15:00.483 --> 15:03.350
Just as I thought. Emptiness.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.894
Nothing inside.
It's always something out there...

15:06.072 --> 15:08.984
...that gets the blame or the credit,
whether it's Jesus or gin.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.149
-Who are you?
-What I can't believe...

15:11.327 --> 15:14.785
...is that your daughter still manages
to feel any love for you at all...

15:14.956 --> 15:18.073
...since you've abused, neglected,
betrayed and forsaken her love...

15:18.251 --> 15:21.835
...since the moment she could feel.
That's extraordinary.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.707
She's a hell of a girl.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.339
Come on. Let's get you home.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.637
-You killed her?
-Not entirely, no.

15:32.807 --> 15:36.846
Well, you obviously did something
to this-- This....

15:37.019 --> 15:39.635
-Now, how old are you?
-Seventeen.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.180
Oh, my God. Where are your parents?

15:42.692 --> 15:46.856
-Is she always like this?
-So, what then, you...

15:47.280 --> 15:48.486
...bit her?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.192
Yes.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.028
-You drained her?
-Yes.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.660
Did you have sex with her?

15:55.830 --> 15:58.287
ﬁ‘ ﬁfe}
tgétixarg

15:59.041 --> 16:02.169
Jessica was brought to me
as a condition of my punishment.

16:02.336 --> 16:07.330
I had to create a vampire as reparation
for the one I destroyed to save you.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.465
So this is all your fault.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.723
Jessica, I need you to retire
for the morning.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.642
My sleeping quarters
are beneath the stairs.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.974
And you may stay there
until we make other arrangements.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.402
Compared to Fangtasia, this blows.

16:42.335 --> 16:47.375
We can't turn her out. Not yet.
She's a very young vampire.

16:48.341 --> 16:52.334
At her age, with her impulses,
she could be quite dangerous.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.551
Where has she been tonight?

16:54.722 --> 16:56.838
Here with me.
Before that, with Eric and Pam.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.759
There's no way she could have anything to
do with the woman with her heart missing?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.473
No.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.851
Probably not.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.946
Two weeks and you never said anything.

17:14.116 --> 17:18.109
I've laid in bed for hours
talking about my life, your life...

17:18.287 --> 17:20.824
...the weather, rules of football...

17:20.998 --> 17:24.286
...and not once did you mention
that you slept with and killed...

17:24.460 --> 17:27.293
-I did not.
-...a 17-year-old girl.

17:29.632 --> 17:30.963
SooMe”.

17:31.467 --> 17:36.427
...for a century and a half,
I never turned a human...

17:37.974 --> 17:42.968
...because I couldn't bear to inflict
the suffering I felt when I was turned.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.144
The pain of that
is not an easy thing to share.

17:46.315 --> 17:50.433
If I'm with you, and she's with you,
then she's with me.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.478
And I'm sure as heck sharing in that.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.988
If I withheld anything,
it was only to protect you.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.150
If she'd stayed with Eric
I still wouldn't know, would I?

17:59.328 --> 18:02.616
That's not protecting me,
that's lying to me.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.496
How am I supposed to ever trust you
if you keep something like that from me?

18:08.963 --> 18:10.794
What else are you keeping from me?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.672
Nothing.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.345
I can't stay.

18:21.684 --> 18:22.844
Not tonight.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.518
SooMe.

18:26.689 --> 18:30.022
I've shared every dark,
horrible corner of my life with you.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.480
What made you think
I couldn't handle every bit of yours?

18:35.656 --> 18:38.398
I'm a lot stronger than you think.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.120
The vampires have cheated death.

18:52.381 --> 18:56.215
When death has no meaning,
life has no meaning.

18:56.385 --> 19:00.173
And when life has no meaning,
it is very, very easy to kill.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.055
Not true, Reverend New/in.
Life has great meaning for us.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.931
We 've all known the joy
of human life.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.099
And as several of your kind
demonstrated in Louisiana...

19:09.273 --> 19:10.649
...we most certainly can die.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.398
Your assertion is little more
than veiled incitement...

19:13.569 --> 19:15.480
...for your supporters to come kill us.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.520
No amount of political grandstanding...

19:17.698 --> 19:20.781
...can hide the fact that you know
who killed my family.

19:20.951 --> 19:25.490
-Their blood is on your hands.
-That's an outrageous accusation.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.700
Can you back that up?

19:28.042 --> 19:30.829
My father's death was an assassination,
pure and simple.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.336
A killing meticulously planned,
ruthlessly executed.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.590
From there, all you have to ask is,
"Who stands the most to gain?"

19:37.760 --> 19:39.751
We 're running out of time.
Miss Flanagan?

19:39.929 --> 19:42.511
Reverend Newlin's grief
over the loss of his father...

19:42.682 --> 19:45.765
...hasn’t hindered him
from some political grandstanding himself.

19:45.935 --> 19:51.271
It's a beautiful, sunny morning in America,
Miss Flanagan. I wish you were here.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.931
Give me 12 hours, Reverend.
I'll be right there.

19:54.110 --> 19:57.523
All right, thank you.
Nan Flanagan and Reverend Steve New/in.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.983
May his holy light
shine upon you, Sharon.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.113
Coming up at the top of the hour....

20:02.284 --> 20:04.411
-|'|| be right back.
-Okay.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.579
You're so handsome.
You're getting good at this.

20:08.749 --> 20:13.243
Getting better. Got a long way to go.
Any notes?

20:13.421 --> 20:17.539
Well, sometimes you can sound
a little too much like a preacher.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.752
Well--

20:18.926 --> 20:20.462
I'm just thinking ahead, darling.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.673
You could be governor of Texas
if you play your cards right.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.804
You know, you had her cornered.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.432
I thought those fangs
were gonna come out any second.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.094
I wish they would. That'd be a sight.
Let the world see what she really is.

20:32.273 --> 20:36.141
Morning, everybody. How'd I do?
Thanks so much.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.025
-You were great.
-Can you get some pineapple out here?

20:39.196 --> 20:42.108
Hey, how are you doing?
I wish my daddy was here to see you.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.568
Thank you so much, Reverend.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.158
Have a good time.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.990
Orry Dawson, you son of a gun,
come here.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.280
Oh, Reverend.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.449
Mrs. Newlin.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.414
I have someone I'd like you to meet.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.923
This here is Jason Stackhouse
from down the road a piece in Bon Temps.

21:01.093 --> 21:05.336
Wow, you're, like,
the most famous person I ever met.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.176
-We're all equals here.
-Wait, Bon Temps.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.842
Weren't you that poor soul they were
accusing of all those terrible murders?

21:12.021 --> 21:13.261
Yeah, I was.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.015
But I was saved,
just like Orry said I would be.

21:17.193 --> 21:21.027
And for the first time in my life,
I feel like God has a purpose for me.

21:21.197 --> 21:24.781
Well, he does. He does for us all.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.859
This here's God's purpose for me.

21:28.037 --> 21:32.076
Oh, I've been reading your father's book,
and it's really making me...

21:32.708 --> 21:35.370
...think about things.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.786
Well, then you realize
his true message is love.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.671
Despite of what all those
liberal wing nuts say about him.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.300
It's like he says in the book.
I'm coming from the darkness into the light.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.386
Jason's a newcomer to our flock...

21:47.556 --> 21:50.218
...but he's been most enthusiastic
about the message.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.884
-He's got great potential.
-That's high praise coming from Orry.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.520
He was one of my father's
closest advisors.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.853
You know, I think Jason
would make a fine candidate...

22:00.027 --> 22:02.018
...for the Light of Day Institute.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.983
Steve and Sarah
run a leadership conference in Texas...

22:05.157 --> 22:08.069
...where they train the best and brightest
to spread our gospel.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.906
Think of it as a springboard
for fulfilling your destiny.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.494
-A leadership conference?
-It is a terrific program, Jason.

22:15.668 --> 22:20.207
Now, if you have the time and money,
it is a once-in-a-Iifetime opportunity.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.712
How much is it gonna cost me?

22:22.258 --> 22:25.250
-Well, I don't handle the money myself--
-Twelve hundred dollars.

22:25.427 --> 22:29.261
We cover room, board and transportation
and you just pay for your class fees.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.092
I don't know ifl can afford that.

22:31.267 --> 22:36.261
I know it's a hardship,
but there's no price for salvation.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.930
Why don't you pray on it?
God'll give you a sign.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.563
Okay. I'll pray on it.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.238
God'll give me a sign.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.947
May his holy light shine upon you.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.452
She was expecting you last night.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.958
Yeah, there was a bit of a....
A murder in my parking lot.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.872
We heard.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.171
I'll see if Maryann is available.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.254
How did you get in here?

24:39.436 --> 24:42.348
If you'd broken it, I'd be really angry.

24:42.523 --> 24:45.230
I'll just go.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.523
In this weather?

24:48.112 --> 24:49.397
Where are your clothes?

24:51.031 --> 24:52.407
I don't know.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.200
You are very interesting.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.787
-How old are you?
-Seventeen.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.916
It's a beauty, isn't it?

25:09.717 --> 25:11.582
Mycenaean, I'm told.

25:13.053 --> 25:16.762
Maryann's still asleep.
Is there a message I may pass along?

25:17.182 --> 25:20.219
Just tell her I have something for her.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.612
Shoot

27:00.035 --> 27:03.527
-Have a seat, Mr. Lancaster.
-Thank you.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.753
Is there a problem
with my grandmother's papers?

27:12.923 --> 27:15.380
I know you asked for a copy
of the deed to the house.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.042
Oh, no, no, that's all okay.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.049
I have some terrible news, I'm afraid.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.727
Your great-uncle Bartlett has passed on.

27:29.815 --> 27:34.104
I know it's so soon after your grandmother.
This must be quite a shock.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.069
Tell me what happened.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.026
Well...

27:40.659 --> 27:46.074
...the Lincoln Parish Fire Department
found him a few miles south of Simsboro.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.867
He'd washed up on the shore.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.707
How'd he get all the way down there?

27:52.713 --> 27:55.705
The Walnut Creek runs behind his house.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.750
Sheriff's guessing
he got too close and fell in.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.634
They're calling it an accident officially.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.512
There's no sign of burglary
or forced entry at the house...

28:04.683 --> 28:06.719
...and he was such a sweet old man.

28:06.894 --> 28:10.432
There'd be no reason to hurt him anyway.

28:11.857 --> 28:15.190
There were no marks or anything
on his body?

28:15.861 --> 28:22.323
Well, there's gators and fish in the water,
and he'd been there for a few weeks...

28:23.285 --> 28:26.948
...so there's not much
of a body to speak of.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.078
Oh, my God.

28:30.500 --> 28:37.292
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
He was truly a kind, giving man.

28:38.258 --> 28:41.045
I was proud to call him my friend.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.385
Oh, no, no, no.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.422
The one consolation, Sookie...

28:47.601 --> 28:51.139
...is that your great-uncle Bartlett
cared for you very deeply.

28:51.313 --> 28:57.309
He stated in his will that he wished
for you to inherit all his financial assets.

28:57.486 --> 29:01.855
It's not much.
Eleven thousand, thereabouts.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.239
But it's a token
of how special you were to him.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.323
Go ahead, take it.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.951
It's yours.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.356
Stunning, isn't it?

29:47.119 --> 29:50.031
It's the god Pan and his human lover.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.036
And she doesn't have a name?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.248
She could be any of us, couldn't she?

29:57.421 --> 29:59.662
The Greeks knew
there was the flimsiest veil...

29:59.840 --> 30:02.047
...between us and the divine.

30:02.426 --> 30:06.510
They didn't see the gods as being
inaccessible the way everyone does today.

30:06.680 --> 30:07.795
Except for my mama.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.134
She thinks she's got
a direct line to Jesus.

30:11.184 --> 30:15.097
You have an uncanny talent for connecting
everything back to your mother.

30:15.272 --> 30:18.560
Don't get me wrong. She deserved
everything you gave her, but still....

30:18.734 --> 30:22.226
If you took care of yourself for once
instead of protecting her...

30:22.404 --> 30:25.771
...she'd still be your mother,
you'd just be happier.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.161
I could use some more papaya.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.494
Doesn't it seem like she's got
an endless supply of tropical fruit?

30:40.756 --> 30:43.247
-And pot.
-Now, that I didn't notice.

30:43.425 --> 30:48.715
I've been smoking pot since I was 10.
My first kumquat, three months ago.

30:49.723 --> 30:52.715
I thought I was bad,
sneaking cigarettes when I was 12.

30:55.062 --> 30:57.348
Well, girl, if you think that's bad...

30:57.522 --> 31:00.104
...I don't even wanna tell you
the other shit I've done.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.443
Have you ever...?

31:09.743 --> 31:10.903
With Maryann?

31:14.498 --> 31:16.238
You must be high.

31:16.416 --> 31:20.876
I mean, she's so far beyond me,
it's like she's on another plane.

31:21.046 --> 31:24.789
I'm starting to get her more every day,
but I think the main idea is...

31:24.966 --> 31:26.957
...we're all luckier than we can imagine.

31:28.178 --> 31:32.547
Maybe you are. You didn'tjust see
your first dead body last night.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.306
Well...

31:35.769 --> 31:38.636
...you're lucky you made it this far
before seeing one.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.521
Trust me, I've seen more than I care to.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.063
And you're okay with that?

31:45.737 --> 31:48.399
Sure. It's lucky I wasn't one of them.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.156
And I'm also lucky
you haven't moved my hand yet.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.583
Fresh towels.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.957
They're Egyptian.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.750
Thanks.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.464
I should--

32:12.305 --> 32:14.842
I should really get changed for work.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.159
Karl.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.838
Nobody needed towels.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.842
Yeah, I guess I do miss
that son of a bitch.

32:57.017 --> 32:59.008
He was my best friend.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.852
Yeah, mine too.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.730
But then I think:

33:05.901 --> 33:07.687
"How can that be the same fuck who--?"

33:07.861 --> 33:10.853
Because we never knew
who Rene really was.

33:11.031 --> 33:13.568
All those innocent people he killed.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.403
You know what I can't believe?

33:19.915 --> 33:22.907
That God would let them die
for no reason.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.371
You know, when I-- When I was in jail...

33:28.548 --> 33:31.585
...the Fellowship of the Sun,
they came to visit me.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.087
The vampire haters?

33:33.261 --> 33:36.424
No, it turns out they're about a lot more
than just vampires.

33:36.598 --> 33:40.136
I tell you, if I'm ever gonna find answers,
that's where it's gonna be.

33:41.353 --> 33:45.266
Yeah, but why does it gotta be with them?
I mean, we got a church right here.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.273
And what does our
back-ass church give you?

33:48.443 --> 33:52.027
Well, they teach me to be a Christian,
for one, and not hate vampires...

33:52.197 --> 33:53.277
...or hate anybody else.

33:53.448 --> 33:57.441
See, you're hung up on the hating.
The Fellowship, it's bigger than that.

33:57.619 --> 34:00.577
When I'm there,
I feel like I'm meant to be a part of it...

34:00.747 --> 34:03.033
...Iike I got a calling from Jesus.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.200
Or from Steve Newlin himself.

§>;.;_::;§5_{,

34:16.304 --> 34:18.795
Hey, Sookie, I heard about the....

34:19.474 --> 34:22.056
At Merlotte's. I'm sorry.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.309
Thanks, Hoyt, that's sweet of you.

34:24.479 --> 34:25.935
-Jason.
-Yeah?

34:26.106 --> 34:28.643
Sid Matt Lancaster came by a bit ago.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.900
He had some-- Some bad news.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.064
Uncle Bartlett passed away.

34:36.950 --> 34:39.612
-Well, what happened?
-They're saying it was an accident.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.448
He fell into the Walnut Creek
behind his house.

34:42.622 --> 34:45.409
-No,no.
-There's something else.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.580
He-- He left us an inheritance.

34:51.339 --> 34:56.174
Well, he left me the inheritance,
but I don't want it. Here.

34:57.095 --> 35:00.508
Wait. Why--? Why did he leave it to you?

35:00.682 --> 35:03.970
-| used to mow his lawn every Sunday.
-I don't know. He was old.

35:04.144 --> 35:07.261
-Just-- It's yours now.
-Come on, now. Maybe we should split it.

35:07.439 --> 35:11.352
Jason, I do not want it.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.319
Okay?

35:15.071 --> 35:16.982
I gotta get to work.

35:17.907 --> 35:19.693
It's good to see you, Hoyt.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.044
Thank you.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.807
Is this what you imagined
it would feel like?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.558
No.

35:48.980 --> 35:53.394
You stay with me
and we will do things...

35:53.568 --> 35:56.685
...that you cannot possibly imagine.

36:04.663 --> 36:09.077
-What's wrong?
-Don't stop. Don't stop.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.671
What are you?

36:18.259 --> 36:22.468
Baby boy, you're not the only one
who's special in this world.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.759
Hey, Sam. I don't know when you're
planning on hiring another waitress...

36:28.937 --> 36:32.429
...but me and Sookie are fixing to drop dead
from exhaustion. Lookie here.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.438
Nine out of 10 broken.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.437
Yeah.

36:37.404 --> 36:40.362
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to put an ad out.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.444
Well, that's why Daphne's here.
She came in looking for work...

36:43.618 --> 36:47.202
...and I think you owe it to yourself
to at least give her an interview.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.454
I used to work at the Cracker Barrel
in Alexandria.

36:51.167 --> 36:55.627
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure. Come on in.
-Thank you.

36:55.922 --> 37:00.541
Oh, Sam. Can I start parking
over near your trailer?

37:01.177 --> 37:03.919
Instead of, you know, where the--?

37:04.097 --> 37:06.588
Yeah. Yeah, you go ahead.

37:07.392 --> 37:11.305
I love you. Nine out of 10.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.231
Hey. Hey, Sam Merlotte.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.940
-Hey.
-Hey. Daphne, right? I like the name.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.732
I think it's French.
My mama's half Cajun.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.242
So Cracker Barrel, huh?

37:33.710 --> 37:36.452
-Some people think I'm an asshole.
-No.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.290
It's true.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.874
Picked fights with strangers,
I've cussed out old ladies.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.303
I even pissed in my boss' coffee once.

37:44.471 --> 37:48.555
-You do not need to be telling me this shit.
-What else is there to do down here?

37:48.725 --> 37:52.684
-I mean, don't you talk to the others?
-No.

37:54.105 --> 37:58.098
Mostly I just keep to my fucking self.

38:01.738 --> 38:06.107
-And think.
-Like about how to get out of here?

38:06.868 --> 38:10.201
More about why I'm here to begin with.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.325
All the shit I've done in my life.

38:13.500 --> 38:19.370
The drugs, the sex, the website.

38:19.589 --> 38:23.878
I did it so my life wouldn't be a dead end,
and this is where I end up.

38:26.179 --> 38:30.593
-Now, what kind of punchline is that?
-Well, see, that's why we gotta talk.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.053
We gotta tell each other
all the shit we've done.

38:33.228 --> 38:38.222
That way if one of us gets out,
he can tell the world about both of us.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.732
I just hope it's me.

38:41.236 --> 38:45.024
Whatever. If it make you feel
any better, keep talking.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.938
All right then.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.909
When I was 20, my cousin Rufus,
he was going out with this girl...

38:52.080 --> 38:55.243
...who claimed she could crush a beer can
with her tits.

38:56.292 --> 39:00.160
And one night when we were alone,
I asked her to show me.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.171
One beer can led to another,
and before you knew it...

39:03.341 --> 39:06.083
...she was crushing my head...

39:06.261 --> 39:08.001
...with her tits.

39:08.513 --> 39:12.677
Rufus came home, and he was so mad,
he threw me out the window.

39:13.601 --> 39:20.598
My hip shattered into a million pieces
and they replaced it with metal.

39:21.651 --> 39:24.438
My ass is magnetic now.

39:26.239 --> 39:30.152
I pray to God you ain't
the last motherfucker I meet before I die.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.282
Come on, come on.

39:32.453 --> 39:36.446
What about you? You must have done
all kinds of shit you regret.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.074
Well, I got in trouble
with my boss once...

39:39.252 --> 39:43.291
...for punching out
three stupid rednecks at the bar.

39:44.132 --> 39:48.341
-You regret that?
-Hell, no. You fucking deserved it.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.011
Yeah.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.966
Hey, I'm sorry I hassled you
for being gay.

39:57.604 --> 39:58.889
I was an asshole about it.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.772
Well, at least I got through to you.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.023
If it makes you feel any better...

40:08.197 --> 40:12.657
...when I was 15 at Safety Patrol Camp...

40:13.328 --> 40:15.944
...I let my bunk mate blow me.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.661
You--

40:32.388 --> 40:33.844
Hey.

40:34.515 --> 40:37.473
Name Nancy Levoir ring a ding?

40:37.644 --> 40:39.680
-How about Miss Jeanette?
-No.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.436
-Pitcher of Abita Light.
-Not their usual Dixie draft?

40:42.607 --> 40:46.065
Jason's not drinking and Hoyt says
his mama wants him to watch his weight.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.191
Please. She's one to talk.

40:48.363 --> 40:51.855
That woman's got more chins
than a Chinese phone book.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.363
-Come on, have a drink with me.
-I don't drink no more.

40:55.536 --> 40:59.700
I don't do nothing that can screw me up.
Them days are over.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.866
Well, you don't gotta be drunk
to bang my brains out, do you?

41:03.044 --> 41:04.875
I appreciate the offer, darling...

41:05.046 --> 41:08.004
...but I'm happy
hanging with my buddy tonight.

41:08.383 --> 41:13.218
-Oh, are you two, like, gay together?
-No. Just turning over a new leaf.

41:13.763 --> 41:16.004
Your loss, baby.

41:16.724 --> 41:20.467
How about you? You wanna party?

41:21.980 --> 41:25.689
Never mind. Time's up. I don't teach.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.814
I absorb.

41:32.740 --> 41:36.824
Hey, bubba. I gotta stay pure
for that leadership conference...

41:36.995 --> 41:40.032
...but if you wanna hit that, man,
I'm cool.

41:41.582 --> 41:46.246
No. No, I'm not much of a hitter,
you know?

41:47.296 --> 41:48.877
I like them nicer than that.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.881
DuraStrong 40-gallon trash liners.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.633
Found one at the scene.
They sell them at club stores.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.920
You know anybody
who uses them, call me.

41:57.098 --> 41:58.588
All right.

42:02.770 --> 42:06.058
I was just out back,
and you can smell the blood out there.

42:06.232 --> 42:09.190
What kind of sick animal
would keep a poor woman's heart?

42:09.360 --> 42:12.818
Well, you know Rene Lenier,
or Marshall whatever-his-name-was?

42:12.989 --> 42:17.028
I heard that the American Vampire League,
they wanted to teach him a lesson.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.988
So they dug him up
and they turned him into one of their own.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.778
So he could have killed that woman.

42:21.956 --> 42:25.494
Better be careful.
Rene Marshall might still get you.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.879
Don't you people have any shame?
His name was Drew Marshall.

42:32.050 --> 42:35.793
And he's dead, and he's buried,
and he ain't never coming back.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.348
That's for your drinks.
Now, y'all need to leave.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.605
Up. Shake a leg. Out! Go!

42:49.776 --> 42:53.109
-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-Keep walking. Don't eyeball me.

42:53.279 --> 42:55.110
He's such a nut ball.

42:57.658 --> 43:00.525
You didn't have to do that.

43:02.330 --> 43:06.073
Leadership conference, huh?
What church?

43:07.126 --> 43:09.412
Marlboro. Baptist.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.667
In Baton Rouge.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.669
It's only for a week.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.126
Just give me a chance
to get away from everything.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.508
I wish I could take a week off.

43:18.930 --> 43:22.593
I finally started cleaning out
Gran's room today.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.509
I couldn't even bear
to pack away a single thing.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.814
Yeah, I know. I miss her too.

43:29.315 --> 43:32.728
And I'm hoping maybe God'll tell me
why he had to take good people away.

43:32.902 --> 43:36.190
-Like Gran and Amy.
-Jason, Amy was a V addict.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.901
Yeah, that don't mean
she deserved to die.

43:39.492 --> 43:42.199
I can't help it, Sook, I loved her.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.782
And when you love someone,
you gotta love it all.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.538
Othen/vise it ain't love.

43:49.377 --> 43:52.790
There you are, Stackhouse.
Got a couple of questions for you.

43:53.214 --> 43:56.377
Humor him, he's toasted.
Have a good time at church camp.

43:56.551 --> 43:57.916
Okay.

44:00.596 --> 44:02.132
Hey, y'all.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.466
-We won.
-We won, we won.

44:03.641 --> 44:06.678
There you go.
Come on, darling. One more time.

44:08.646 --> 44:13.811
-Hey, girl. You know where Sam is?
-Out back. He's been a little weird tonight.

44:14.152 --> 44:17.235
I heard about your uncle Bartlett.
I'm sorry.

44:17.405 --> 44:20.363
Thanks. I think I'll be fine.

44:20.533 --> 44:23.240
I wish people would stop dying
around here though.

44:25.246 --> 44:26.907
Try the A-negative.

44:35.006 --> 44:39.966
Less like ass than the A-positive,
but more like ass than the B-negative.

44:40.136 --> 44:42.422
You have to keep your strength.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.259
Two thirds of new vampires
never survive the first year.

44:45.433 --> 44:48.095
Well, I can't help it if I don't like it.

44:48.269 --> 44:52.103
You know, Eric let me feed on a guy
with tattoos and nipple piercings.

44:52.273 --> 44:56.232
-I am not Eric.
-Oh, you are so not Eric.

45:05.119 --> 45:08.532
Hey. Hardly seen you all night.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.660
Well, haven't had the best day.

45:11.834 --> 45:14.041
The woman in the parking lot,
or something else?

45:14.212 --> 45:16.874
Well, don't feel much like talking.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.629
Okay.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.794
It's slowing down pretty good in there,
so I was--

45:21.969 --> 45:25.427
-You wanna cut out and go see Bill?
-I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.463
We had a fight,
and there's some things--

45:27.642 --> 45:30.224
I don't need to hear
every last detail of your life.

45:33.105 --> 45:35.972
I guess I've owed you an apology
for a while now.

45:37.318 --> 45:40.936
I never meant to hurt you, Sam.
You know how much I care about--

45:41.113 --> 45:44.321
Don't it seem like you're always
either apologizing or yelling at me?

45:44.492 --> 45:46.278
-Don't you get sick of it?
-Sam.

45:46.452 --> 45:49.489
Because I sure do.
I can't be whatever you want...

45:49.664 --> 45:51.495
...whenever you want anymore.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.999
I'm tired of charring my ass
on your back burner.

45:56.837 --> 46:00.000
I'm gonna need you in early
to make up for lost hours.

46:01.634 --> 46:03.670
In Keachi.

46:03.844 --> 46:08.338
You ever get a prescription
filled out there? Don't lie to me.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.472
You sure about that?

46:14.689 --> 46:17.351
-Now there.
-What? I'm working.

46:18.276 --> 46:21.518
Clearing my name
since I'm a suspect, allegedly.

46:21.696 --> 46:24.312
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll just do-si-do round here.

46:24.490 --> 46:26.026
Andy.

46:26.701 --> 46:30.034
You're embarrassing yourself.
I'm taking you off the case.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.115
For your own sake.

46:33.124 --> 46:34.785
Bud.

46:35.126 --> 46:37.037
I'm a good cop.

46:37.211 --> 46:39.953
I can close a case.
Let me show people that, please.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.372
Can't you go do something else?

46:43.134 --> 46:46.501
I don't do anything else. This is it.

46:48.848 --> 46:50.930
I'm sorry, Andy.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.449
You have something of mine.

48:00.044 --> 48:03.207
Karl said you stopped by with a gift.

48:05.299 --> 48:06.960
I do love presents.

48:25.194 --> 48:30.154
I don't know how you found me,
but I assume this is what you came for.

48:33.244 --> 48:38.159
I'm sorry.
I was young and scared at the time.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.162
I remember.

48:51.137 --> 48:52.172
Money?

48:55.433 --> 48:58.140
Oh, you sweet thing.

48:58.727 --> 49:00.342
It's not your money I want.

49:02.106 --> 49:04.848
Listen, if you think you can
get back at me by luring Tara--

49:05.025 --> 49:07.277
Get back at you?

49:08.737 --> 49:11.353
How in the world
did you get the impression...

49:11.532 --> 49:13.443
...that this was about you?

49:15.995 --> 49:20.409
What? Maryann said she was coming down,
and I just wanted to see you.

49:20.583 --> 49:24.622
Still? You're either dumber than I thought
or way too good for me.

49:24.795 --> 49:28.583
Cut it out. I just wanted to see
where you work. Is that so bad?

49:29.758 --> 49:31.373
Well, you are a lucky man.

49:31.552 --> 49:35.966
And since the bartender likes you,
drinks are on the house. What'll it be?

49:37.266 --> 49:38.676
Give me something sweet.

49:39.268 --> 49:44.888
Well, I can make you a rum and Coke,
margarita, or a White Russ--

49:50.237 --> 49:51.898
That's more like it.

50:13.260 --> 50:16.093
All right, I guess that's not so gross.

50:16.472 --> 50:19.179
Two parts O-negative
to one part B-positive.

50:19.350 --> 50:20.931
Remember that.

50:23.604 --> 50:25.515
I need to talk to you.

50:25.856 --> 50:30.270
-Alone.
-I don't know if we can, with....

50:34.740 --> 50:39.609
Jess, I feel like we got off to a bad start,
and it's totally my fault.

50:39.787 --> 50:42.119
I never got a chance
to hear your side of things...

50:42.289 --> 50:45.406
...find out what you're like, none of that.
Can you forgive me?

50:46.085 --> 50:50.249
-You really wanna get to know me?
-Of course I do. You deserve that.

50:50.798 --> 50:57.044
And frankly, I'm curious about you.
I've just got one huge favor to ask.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.177
Give me tonight with my boyfriend...

50:59.348 --> 51:02.340
...and we'll have all night tomorrow
to ourselves.

51:02.518 --> 51:03.724
Just us girls.

51:06.689 --> 51:09.772
Sure. I mean, I guess I got
nothing but time now, right?

51:14.655 --> 51:16.145
Good night.

51:18.158 --> 51:20.114
I must say I'm impressed.

51:22.454 --> 51:24.160
It's almost like you glamoured her--

51:24.331 --> 51:27.243
Did you have anything to do
with Uncle Bartlett's death?

51:36.427 --> 51:37.507
He hurt you.

51:40.389 --> 51:42.425
Oh, my God.

51:43.559 --> 51:46.141
Is it that easy for you to kill?

51:46.312 --> 51:51.022
Does human life mean so little
you can just kill on command?

51:51.191 --> 51:52.852
Toss someone in the water?

51:55.863 --> 52:00.277
I cannot have people dying
every time I confide in you.

52:00.451 --> 52:04.694
I never felt more inhuman than when
I had to kill Rene. It still haunts me.

52:04.872 --> 52:08.615
And now you've made me feel
like I killed another person.

52:09.376 --> 52:10.957
I feel sick.

52:16.842 --> 52:19.925
I always thought,
as different as we are...

52:20.763 --> 52:25.177
...somehow we could still be together.

52:25.726 --> 52:28.843
And-- And now I don't know.

52:30.939 --> 52:33.100
I don't know anything.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.314
Please...

52:44.119 --> 52:46.405
...say something, Bill.

52:59.134 --> 53:00.795
SooMe.

53:03.097 --> 53:07.431
I cannot, and I will not lose you.

53:07.893 --> 53:13.934
For all the ways I have dismayed,
aggrieved, or failed you...

53:14.108 --> 53:16.520
...I swear I will atone.

53:18.070 --> 53:19.776
But I am not sorry.

53:21.615 --> 53:26.279
I refuse to apologize
for what you have awakened in me.

53:27.287 --> 53:28.868
You....

53:29.373 --> 53:32.206
You are my miracle, Sookie.

53:33.627 --> 53:38.291
For the first time in 140 years,
I felt something...

53:38.465 --> 53:41.582
...I thought had been lost to me forever.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.469
I love you.

53:49.226 --> 53:51.638
And for that, I shall never feel sorry.

53:53.814 --> 53:56.851
Oh, damn you, Bill Compton.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.817
I love you.

55:26.615 --> 55:29.948
-I got a plan. I'm busting us out.
-Don't be an idiot.

55:30.118 --> 55:33.201
-|'|| come back for you. I promise.
-Shut up.

55:38.710 --> 55:41.042
You know, shushing won't do any good,
sweetheart.

55:41.421 --> 55:43.878
We hear everything.

55:44.049 --> 55:48.008
Well, since you made me come down here,
I ought to take out some of the garbage.

55:55.394 --> 55:57.931
Royce Allen Williams.

55:58.438 --> 56:00.053
We have a few questions for you...

56:00.232 --> 56:03.724
...with regard to a fire
which claimed three of our kind.

56:03.902 --> 56:07.110
No fucking way, man.
I don't know anything.

56:07.281 --> 56:11.524
Crimes against vampires are on the rise.
We lost a sheriffjust days ago.

56:12.619 --> 56:15.861
-And we seek answers.
-No.No.

56:16.582 --> 56:17.913
No.

56:18.083 --> 56:19.539
Die, you dead fucker!
