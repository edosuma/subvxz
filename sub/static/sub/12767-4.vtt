ON THE BEACH ALONE.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.834
I HAD LUNCH ALONE.

00:15.875 --> 00:18.166
I RAN MY ERRANDS

I WANT MY FRIEND BACK.

IT COULD BE ENVIRONMENTAL,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.083

05:59.417 --> 06:01.625

06:10.875 --> 06:14.041
WHAT? NO.
YOU CHOOSE WHICH ONE OF US
RUNS THE PRACTICE.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.125
AND WE'LL ABIDE BY
THE DECISION.

06:16.166 --> 06:19.000
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
THIS IS GONNA TEAR US APART.
I WARNED YOU.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.542
LOOK, YOU WERE RIGHT.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.625
WE CAN'T KEEP ON THE WAY
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.792
SO WE WILL CAMPAIGN FAIRLY.
RIGHT, NO DIRTY TRICKS,
NO BRIBERY.

06:24.834 --> 06:28.041
CIVIL, DEMOCRATIC--THE WAY
THE PRACTICE SHOULD BE RUN.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.667
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT
I WANT ANYTHING ELSE?

06:30.709 --> 06:33.667
DO I GET A VOTE? I MEAN,
I AM PART OF THE PRACTICE.

06:33.709 --> 06:35.500
THAT WAS THE DEAL, RIGHT?
YEAH, OF COURSE YOU ARE.

06:35.542 --> 06:38.667
RIGHT. I-I WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

06:38.709 --> 06:40.667

06:40.709 --> 06:43.417

06:58.417 --> 07:00.041

07:00.083 --> 07:02.667

07:02.709 --> 07:05.041

07:14.166 --> 07:17.709

MY MIDWIFE CERTIFICATION.
I KNOW.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.875
IT'S JUST THAT THE COLES, UH,

08:04.792 --> 08:08.166
YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE PICTURES,
NAKED, ON THAT WEB SITE.
WHAT?

08:08.208 --> 08:10.625
THE DATING SITE
FOR ADULTS.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.834
YOU SAW THAT?

08:12.875 --> 08:14.959
YOU ARE A DOCTOR,
A PEDIATRICIAN--

08:15.000 --> 08:17.750
PLEASE, NICOLE--
HOW CAN YOU WORK
WITH CHILDREN?

08:17.792 --> 08:19.750
OKAY, THAT SITE
HAS NOTHING TO...

08:19.792 --> 08:23.583
MY PERSONAL LIFE DOES NOT IMPACT
THE CARE I GIVE MY PATIENTS.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.792
HOW CAN IT NOT?

08:25.834 --> 08:28.542
YOU SHOULD NOT BE A DOCTOR.

08:30.792 --> 08:33.417
SO YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
SOME DISCOMFORT?

08:33.458 --> 08:34.917
SORT OF.

08:34.959 --> 08:36.959
WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU
FEELING PAIN?

08:40.667 --> 08:43.875
I KNOW DISCUSSING THESE THINGS
CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:43.917 --> 08:47.750
BUT LET'S SEE IF I CAN HELP?

08:47.792 --> 08:51.375
MY DAUGHTER WAS ATTACKED
BY A MAN.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.542
OH.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.750
I'M SO SORRY.

08:55.792 --> 08:58.041
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

08:58.083 --> 09:00.667
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.834
AND, UH, IS THIS SOMETHING
THAT YOU REPORTED?

09:02.875 --> 09:06.041
NO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.
IT IS NOT SOMETHING WE DO.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.834
BUT IF...
IF YOU WERE RAPED,

09:08.875 --> 09:11.667
SHARBAT, YOU REALLY SHOULD
SPEAK TO SOMEONE.

09:11.709 --> 09:14.667
WE HAVE A PSYCHIATRIST HERE--
THAT'S NOT WHY I CAME HERE.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.041
OKAY.

09:16.083 --> 09:19.458
ARE--ARE YOU STILL FEELING
PAIN FROM THE ATTACK?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.709
THERE IS NO PAIN.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.625
WELL--

09:23.667 --> 09:26.291
NO, PLEASE.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.041
I NEED YOU...

09:29.083 --> 09:31.125
TO MAKE ME
A VIRGIN AGAIN.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.291
YOU CAN MAKE HER VIRGIN AGAIN.
I-I KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.542
IN OUR CULTURE,
SOMETIMES IT IS DONE.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.542
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
HYMENOPLASTY?

09:50.583 --> 09:53.125
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
TO BE DONE LIGHTLY.

09:53.166 --> 09:56.959
IT IS A REAL SURGERY WITH
REAL POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.625
AND AS MUCH
AS WE COULD REPAIR THE HYMEN,

10:00.667 --> 10:02.917
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
A VIRGIN.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.083
I AM ENGAGED TO A MAN
IN AFGHANISTAN.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.250
HE WILL TAKE ME AND MY PARENTS
BACK TO OUR COUNTRY,

10:07.291 --> 10:10.333
WHERE WE WILL BE MARRIED,
WHERE HE WILL TAKE CARE OF US.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.417
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

10:13.458 --> 10:15.208
I HAVE NOT MET HIM YET.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.834
HE CAN'T KNOW.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.166
HER STATUS, IT...
IT IS CHECKED.

10:20.208 --> 10:23.250
AND ISLAMIC LAW SAYS SEX
BEFORE MARRIAGE IS NOT ALLOWED.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.375
WE WOULD BE DISGRACED.
I UNDERSTAND.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.041
BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU

10:28.083 --> 10:30.041
IS NOT YOUR FAULT?

10:30.083 --> 10:33.125
I NEED TO BE PURE.
CAN YOU HELP ME?

10:35.417 --> 10:37.375
COOP, DO YOU THINK
MAYBE WE SHOULD--

10:37.417 --> 10:39.875
SORRY, MAN.
UH, A LITTLE LATER.
OKAY, THIS AFTERNOON THEN.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.875
JUST NEED A COUPLE MINUTES,
BIG GUY. THANKS.
HIS VOTE IS SPOKEN FOR.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.375
IT'S FOR NAOMI.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.875
WAIT, NOTHING'S DECIDED
UNTIL ELECTION DAY, VIOLET.

10:46.917 --> 10:49.875
THIS IS A CAMPAIGN
AB-ABOUT IDEAS. YOU HEAR ME? I--

10:49.917 --> 10:51.375
LOST CAUSE.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.834
NO. NOBODY'S A LOST CAUSE,
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE DELL.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.375
DELL IS A RED STATE.

10:55.417 --> 10:56.834
I'M NOT GETTIN' INVOLVED.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.834
I DID GIVE HIM HIS JOB BACK,
BUT HE AND NAI...

10:59.875 --> 11:02.834
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO GET OVER WHAT THEY HAD.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.375
I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED.

11:04.417 --> 11:06.375
YOU KNOW,
HE QUIT BECAUSE OF HER.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.375
SHOULD I REMIND HIM OF THAT?
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS GONNA BE CIVIL.

11:09.417 --> 11:11.667
SO CIVILLY, I'LL REMIND HIM
OF HOW BAD IT WAS.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.291
BAD TIMING, COOP.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.291
BOARD'S GOT A COUPLE
OF BIGWIGS IN,

11:20.333 --> 11:22.291
AND IF I GET ONE MORE COMPLAINT

11:22.333 --> 11:24.291
ABOUT HOW MANY SURGERIES
I SHOULD BE--

11:24.333 --> 11:26.333
I AM NOT IN THE MOOD.

11:26.375 --> 11:30.542
MY DAY'S WORSE. I DON'T FEEL
LIKE HAVING SEX EVER AGAIN.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.542
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:32.583 --> 11:34.583
I CAME TO TALK.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.125
YOU WANTED TO TALK.
YOU'RE NOT TALKING.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.125
DO YOU THINK I'M A PERVERT?

11:44.166 --> 11:47.959
I AM TOO BUSY FOR THIS.
HEY, DOES THIS
NOT BOTHER YOU?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.959
WE'RE BOTH IN THE MIDDLE
OF TOUGH DAYS,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.041
WE CAN'T EVEN DISCUSS IT
WITH ONE ANOTHER?
I DON'T WANT
TO DISCUSS IT, COOPER.

11:53.083 --> 11:56.375
I WANT TO GET THROUGH IT.
MAYBE THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

11:56.417 --> 11:59.041
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET THROUGH MINE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:59.083 --> 12:00.667
A PATIENT'S MOTHER
RECOGNIZED ME

12:00.709 --> 12:02.417
FROM AN ADULT WEB SITE.

12:02.458 --> 12:05.375
SHE DOES NOT WANT ME
TO TREAT HER SON.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.625
THAT'S ABSURD.
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT,

12:07.667 --> 12:11.500
A PATIENT RECOGNIZING YOU
FROM YOUR PRIVATE LIFE?
ONE HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE OTHER.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.875
BESIDES, I TOOK MINE DOWN.

12:13.917 --> 12:17.041
YOU DIDN'T?

12:17.083 --> 12:20.041
HOW MANY SITES
ARE YOU ON, COOP?

12:20.083 --> 12:21.667
TWO? FIVE?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.834
TEN?
ISH.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.083
YOUR PATIENT MIGHT BE RIGHT.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.417
THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.166
I'M A GOOD DOCTOR.

12:32.208 --> 12:35.458
I WANT TO HELP THIS KID.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.291
SHE WANTS
TO BE REVIRGINIZED?

12:37.333 --> 12:39.041
ESSENTIALLY, YES.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.041
BUT I JUST CAN'T SEE
SEWING HER BACK UP.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.291
IT JUST FEELS WRONG.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.125
OKAY, S-SO WAIT A MINUTE.

12:44.166 --> 12:47.125
YOU'RE GOING TO DEPRIVE THIS
GIRL OF THE LIFE THAT SHE WANTS

12:47.166 --> 12:50.125
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ISSUES
WITH IT?
I--

12:50.166 --> 12:52.625
SHE'S A VICTIM,
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP HER?

12:52.667 --> 12:56.333
I JUST FEEL LIKE I AM COLLUDING
WITH THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
WELL, YOU ARE.
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER NO.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.125
ON WHAT GROUNDS?
LEGAL, MORAL, HUMANITARIAN.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.041
WHAT'D YOU GET
IN MEDICAL ETHICS?

13:01.083 --> 13:03.041
THE TEST IS BENEFICENCE
AND AUTONOMY.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.041
WHAT IS BENEFICENT ABOUT
HELPING A YOUNG GIRL

13:05.083 --> 13:07.291
INDULGE A CHAUVINIST FANTASY
BY SEWING UP HER VAGINA?

13:07.333 --> 13:09.291
YEAH, BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT

13:09.333 --> 13:11.917
WHETHER THE DOCTOR
THINKS IT'S RIGHT, IS IT?

13:11.959 --> 13:14.709
IT'S WHETHER THE PATIENT DOES.
(Violet) SHE SHOULD REALLY
TALK TO SOMEONE.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.458
IF YOU WANT TO BRING HER IN...
I ALREADY ASKED.
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.041
SHE WON'T EVEN CALL
THE POLICE.
CALL THE POLICE ABOUT WHAT?

13:20.083 --> 13:23.375
(Pete) ADDISON HAS A PATIENT
WHO WANTS TO BE REVIRGINIZED.
SO SHE CAN MARRY A MAN
SHE'S NEVER MET.

13:23.417 --> 13:26.000
AND THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW?
SHE WAS RAPED, SAM.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.667
OH. WELL, THAT'S AWFUL.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.041
YEAH, IT'S AWFUL.
BUT IF ADDISON DOES THIS,

13:31.083 --> 13:34.083
THEN THE GIRL GOES BACK TO KABUL
TO MARRY A MAN SHE DOESN'T KNOW,

13:34.125 --> 13:37.500
WHO'LL ONLY HAVE HER
IF HER HYMEN IS UNTOUCHED?

13:37.542 --> 13:41.041
THAT'S WRONG.
IT'S LIKE VIOLATING HER TWICE.
YEAH, BUT IT'S HER CHOICE,
ISN'T IT?

13:41.083 --> 13:44.333
CHOICE? THAT GIRL WILL LIKELY
LIVE UNDER A VEIL IN A CLAY HUT

13:44.375 --> 13:46.291
IN A COUNTRY
WHERE SHE COULD BE STONED

13:46.333 --> 13:49.542
FOR LISTENING
TO A MADONNA ALBUM.

13:49.583 --> 13:52.917
YOU THINK SHE UNDERSTANDS
SHE'S CHOOSING THAT?

13:52.959 --> 13:55.041
MEG?

13:55.083 --> 13:57.166
HELLO, PETER.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.667
MEG?
MEG.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.625
DID HE EVER MENTION HER
TO ANYONE?

14:17.667 --> 14:20.625
IF YOU VOTE FOR ME, I PROMISE
TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW.
SAM.

14:20.667 --> 14:23.375
I'M JUST KIDDING.
WHO IS SHE? SHE WAS, UH...

14:23.417 --> 14:25.041
(Dell) SHE WAS SOMETHING.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.250
(gasps)
OH.

14:26.291 --> 14:28.542
OOH.
HMM.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.000
(Violet) WHERE DO YOU THINK
HE KNOWS HER FROM?

14:33.291 --> 14:35.291
ADDISON?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.041
SO YOU WILL DO THIS?

14:41.083 --> 14:43.583
PLEASE SIT.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.000
I RAN YOUR LABS.

14:47.542 --> 14:50.166
IS SOMEONE STILL HURTING YOU?
NO.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.166
YOU SAID YOU WERE RAPED
MONTHS AGO,

14:52.208 --> 14:55.041
BUT THERE ARE TRACES
OF SPERM, SHARBAT,

14:55.083 --> 14:57.875
WHICH INDICATES
SOMETHING IS STILL HAPPENING.

15:01.083 --> 15:04.750
IT'S NOT RAPE.
THERE WAS NEVER A RAPE.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.709
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LIE,
TO TAKE IT THIS FAR.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.250
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND HERE,
AND I LOVE HIM.

15:12.291 --> 15:16.041
BUT YOUR FATHER ARRANGED
A MARRIAGE TO SOMEONE ELSE.
MY PARENTS--

15:16.083 --> 15:19.375
THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE BOY.
HE'S NOT FROM OUR CULTURE.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.458
SO I TOLD MY MOTHER--
I TOLD HER I'D BEEN RAPED.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.458
I THOUGHT SHE'D UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS MEANT

15:24.500 --> 15:27.041
I COULD NOT MARRY THIS MAN,
ONLY SHE FOUND A WAY...

15:27.083 --> 15:29.125
A WAY FOR US ALL TO BE HAPPY.
HAPPY?

15:29.166 --> 15:31.625
MY FATHER DRIVES A CAB.
HE USED TO TEACH UNIVERSITY.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.667
MY MOTHER, SHE IS LONELY.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.917
THEY CAME HERE FOR ME,
BUT THEY ARE MISERABLE.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.709
THIS MAN, HE WILL BRING US
ALL BACK AND TAKE CARE OF US.

15:38.750 --> 15:42.041
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE A VIRGIN.
IF I'M A VIRGIN, WE CAN GO.

15:42.083 --> 15:45.083
WE CAN BE HAPPY.
I WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.834
UH, I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

15:50.875 --> 15:53.709
FOR PUSHING YOU SO HARD
WHEN I FIRST TOOK OVER.

15:53.750 --> 15:57.291
THAT--THAT WAS WRONG,
AND, UH, OKAY, LOOK,

15:57.333 --> 15:59.500
I KNOW THAT YOU AND VIOLET
ARE JOINED AT THE HIP,

15:59.542 --> 16:02.500
AND SHE'S GONNA GO FOR NAOMI,
BUT YOU ARE YOUR OWN MAN,

16:02.542 --> 16:04.500
AND I'VE GOT A LOT
OF GREAT IDEAS--

16:04.542 --> 16:08.250
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ACQUIRED APHASIA?
AC--UH, A BIT.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.750
THIS KID CAME IN.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.250
HE PRESENTED WITH WHAT LOOKED
LIKE LATE ONSET AUTISM,

16:12.291 --> 16:15.041
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE
SOMETHING ELSE.
WHY?

16:15.083 --> 16:18.000
WELL, WE HAD THIS MOMENT
OF... EYE CONTACT.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.041
ALL RIGHT. WELL, AUTISTIC KIDS
MAKE EYE CONTACT.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.000
I KNOW, BUT THIS WAS REAL.

16:22.041 --> 16:24.750
IT REALLY SEEMED LIKE
HE WAS CONNECTING.

16:24.792 --> 16:27.000
KID STOPPED TALKING AT 4.
YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE

16:27.041 --> 16:30.041
HE'S HAVING SEIZURES IN HIS
SLEEP, SO MAYBE NOBODY NOTICED?

16:30.083 --> 16:33.333
YOU THINK I'M GRASPING?
UH, I THINK
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR,

16:33.375 --> 16:35.792
AND IF YOU FIGURE THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON,

16:35.834 --> 16:37.333
THEN THERE PROBABLY IS.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.583
OH, THIS VOTE THING
MAKES YOU AND NAOMI NICER.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.041
WELL, NOT EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT THE VOTE.

16:42.083 --> 16:45.750
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR.
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.500
(Meg) BIG OFFICE,

16:50.542 --> 16:52.500
OH, VIEW OF THE OCEAN,

16:52.542 --> 16:56.291
PATIENTS WHO CAN, UH,
PAY THE BILLS--

16:56.333 --> 16:58.166
SO WHAT'S WRONG?

16:58.208 --> 17:01.041
YOU SAID YOU WERE HERE FOR
A DEVELOPING NATIONS CONFERENCE.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.417
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
PSYCHOANALYSIS.

17:02.458 --> 17:05.041
I THOUGHT I'D STOP IN
WHILE I WAS IN TOWN,

17:05.083 --> 17:06.375
BUT LOOK AT YOU.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.375
YOU NEED HELP--YOUR EYES,
YOUR--YOUR FACE, YOUR ENERGY.

17:09.417 --> 17:11.041
IT'S... (sigh)

17:11.083 --> 17:14.041
THE PRACTICE IS GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.333
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.458
YOU KNOW, UH...

17:18.500 --> 17:20.458
I ALWAYS HATED THE WAY
YOU DID THAT,

17:20.500 --> 17:22.041
KNEW EVERYTHING.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.041
IT'S A CURSE.

17:24.083 --> 17:28.125
BUT COME ON.
YOU NEED A CHANGE.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.166
LIKE WHAT,

17:30.208 --> 17:32.542
AID MISSION
TO THE CONGO?

17:32.583 --> 17:36.375
GHANA. I'M GOING TO NALERIGU
TO ORGANIZE A MALARIA PROGRAM.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.291
OH, THE PETER I REMEMBER
NEVER HESITATED.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.041
HE JUMPED IN
AND DID WHAT NEEDED DOING.

17:45.083 --> 17:47.041
THEN AGAIN,
THE PETER I REMEMBER

17:47.083 --> 17:49.083
WOULD'VE THROWN ME DOWN
ON THIS DESK

17:49.125 --> 17:51.875
TEN SECONDS AFTER I WALKED IN.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.959
HAVE THEY COME OUT
OF PETE'S OFFICE YET?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.041
TH-THE... BLINDS
ARE STILL DRAWN.

18:09.083 --> 18:12.041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WE WAIT UNTIL THEY COME OUT,

18:12.083 --> 18:15.041
AND THEN WE INTERROGATE HIM
OR HER.
NO, ABOUT MY PATIENT SHARBAT.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.709
SHE LIED.
SHE WASN'T RAPED.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.041
SHE LIED?
SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.250
SHE FREAKED OUT, COULDN'T TELL
HER PARENTS THE TRUTH,

18:21.291 --> 18:23.458
KNEW THAT IT WOULD COME OUT.
Y-YOU DON'T LIE
ABOUT RAPE, EVER.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.875
I KNOW, BUT--
NO, THERE'S NO BUTS. THAT'S
WHAT MAKES PEOPLE DOUBT WOMEN.

18:26.917 --> 18:29.417
ONE WOMAN DOES THAT--
I DON'T CARE THE REASON--

18:29.458 --> 18:30.875
IT'S--IT'S BAD FOR EVERYBODY.

18:30.917 --> 18:34.458
DAMN IT. I HATE THAT.
(sighs)

18:34.500 --> 18:37.041
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS,
THE SURGERY.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.458
BUT I THOUGHT THAT--
SHE LIED, ADDISON.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.458
IF SHE'S SOME GIRL WHO'S
SLEEPING AROUND AND TELLING LIES

18:42.500 --> 18:45.458
AND MAKING REAL VICTIMS
LOOK BAD, NO, SHE MADE HER BED.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.583
YOU DON'T LIE ABOUT RAPE.
THAT'S ONE OF MY RULES.

19:04.417 --> 19:07.083
NOW THAT'S THE PETER
I REMEMBER.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.041
JUST DOING
WHAT HAS TO BE DONE.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.333
(laughs)

19:11.375 --> 19:14.041
WHAT'S THAT ON YOUR BACK?
I DON'T KNOW.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.041
SAND FLY BITE.
I GET 'EM ALL THE TIME.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.000
YOU GET SAND FLY BITES
ALL THE TIME?

19:18.041 --> 19:21.000
YEAH, I LIVE 20 METERS OFF
THE KUNU RIVER IN NIGERIA.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.000
THAT'S THE LEAST
OF MY PROBLEMS THERE.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.542
SAND FLY BITES DON'T HAVE
ANNULAR LESIONS LIKE THIS.

19:25.583 --> 19:27.542
STOP WORRYING.
IT'S A BITE.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.750
(chuckles)

19:51.583 --> 19:53.625
IT'S AN INSECT BITE,
RIGHT?

19:53.667 --> 19:56.583
WOW. WHAT BIT YOU
AND DID THAT?

19:56.625 --> 19:58.583
I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY A SAND FLY.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.875
I'VE BEEN LIVING
IN NIGERIA.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.625
(water running)

20:02.667 --> 20:05.375
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW PETE?

20:05.417 --> 20:07.542
WE WERE RESIDENTS TOGETHER.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.875
THEN WE DID
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS

20:09.917 --> 20:11.875
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS
BEFORE HE MOVED HERE.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.041
WHOA, WHOA. PETE DID
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS?
WHEN WAS THAT?

20:14.083 --> 20:17.583
15 YEARS AGO. HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO TAKE A COUPLE MONTHS OFF,

20:17.625 --> 20:19.792
BUT THEN HE MET SOMEBODY,
MARRIED HER,

20:19.834 --> 20:22.041
SETTLED... DOWN HERE.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.792
HE NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT IT?
NO, BUT YOU CAN TELL US.

20:24.834 --> 20:28.709
PETE'S A VERY PRIVATE PERSON.
HE'S VERY SHY. HE'S VERY SHY.
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO BRAG.

20:28.750 --> 20:31.083
UH, TRUST ME.
HE'S NOT SHY.

20:31.125 --> 20:35.041
WELL, I-I DIDN'T MEAN SHY
IN THE--THE "SHY" SENSE.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.041
SO WHAT WAS HE LIKE THEN?

20:37.083 --> 20:39.000
AMAZING.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.250
AMAZING DOCTOR.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.375
WELL, YOU KNOW.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.375
WE'VE ONLY SEEN PETE
DO EASTERN MEDICINE.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.500
WE'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
IN ACTION.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.041
OH.

20:48.083 --> 20:52.041
ONE TIME WE WERE, UH, TREATING
THESE CHILDREN IN BOSNIA.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.709
THE ORPHANAGE
WAS UNDER MORTAR FIRE.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.250
AN EVACUATION WAS ORDERED,

20:56.291 --> 20:58.709
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET THE KIDS OUT.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.959
PETER REFUSED TO LEAVE
THE KIDS BEHIND.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.625
HE STAYED WITH 'EM
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.458
MOST OF THE KIDS SURVIVED
BECAUSE OF HIM.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.083
PETE DID THAT?
OUR PETE?

21:13.125 --> 21:16.500
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY...
"PETE."

21:16.542 --> 21:18.542
TO ME HE WAS ALWAYS "PETER."

21:23.333 --> 21:26.041
PETER.

21:26.083 --> 21:29.041
HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

21:29.083 --> 21:32.041
TO SNOOP ABOUT MEG,
OR HOCK ME FOR A VOTE?

21:32.083 --> 21:35.250
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE VOTE.
THIS IS ABOUT THE PRACTICE...

21:35.291 --> 21:37.333
OKAY.
AND THE DIRECTION
THAT IT IS HEADED IN.

21:37.375 --> 21:40.250
NAI--
AND I THINK THAT I CAN SUM UP
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

21:40.291 --> 21:43.041
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SAM AND ME

21:43.083 --> 21:46.542
AND THE WAY WE SEE THIS PRACTICE
INTO ONE WORD--DEFATALATOR.

21:46.583 --> 21:49.041
DEFATALATOR?
IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT,

21:49.083 --> 21:52.000
A LEAD-IN
TO A TOTAL WELLNESS PROGRAM.

21:52.041 --> 21:55.041
IT'S A SHAME YOU DIDN'T
HAVE IT IN WEST AFRICA.
HE DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

21:55.083 --> 21:56.542
ANOTHER DOCTOR IN THE PRACTICE

21:56.583 --> 21:59.083
WAS PRESSING HIM INTO TRYING
TO BRING IN BUSINESS--

21:59.125 --> 22:00.875
SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER DO.

22:00.917 --> 22:03.709
HI, I'M NAOMI BENNETT.
SHE'S CAMPAIGNING.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.333
AND YOU'RE
THE ANTI-DEFATALATOR CANDIDATE?

22:05.375 --> 22:08.667
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.
IS IT?

22:14.041 --> 22:16.291
(knock on door)

22:16.333 --> 22:17.542
HEY.

22:17.583 --> 22:20.458
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS SURPRISE?

22:22.333 --> 22:24.291
I'VE GOT
THIS COMING WEEKEND OFF,

22:24.333 --> 22:28.041
AND I WAS THINKING YOU, ME,
CABO SAN LUCAS.

22:28.083 --> 22:31.583
A WEEKEND AWAY--
PALMILLA, VERY FANCY,

22:31.625 --> 22:33.458
PERFECT, CLEAR BLUE WATERS.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.458
WE COULD GET AWAY.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.041
MM.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.250
(chuckles)

22:40.291 --> 22:42.208
TOO MUCH?
NO. YES.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.417
NO. YE--

22:44.458 --> 22:47.041
YES. (chuckles) NO. HERE--
HERE'S THE THING--

22:47.083 --> 22:49.041
UM, WE'VE BEEN OUT
A FEW TIMES,

22:49.083 --> 22:52.333
AND, UM, IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.375
I... I REALLY LIKE YOU--

22:54.417 --> 22:57.417
IS THIS WHERE YOU
BREAK UP WITH ME?

22:57.458 --> 22:58.875
NO, NO.

22:58.917 --> 23:02.041
IT'S JUST, UM...
I HAVE THESE RULES.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.041
THEY'RE STUPID RULES,
REALLY.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.875
BUT, UM, IN THE PAST,
WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE RULES,

23:06.917 --> 23:08.875
IT--IT--
IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.417
MY--MY--MY POINT IS THAT

23:10.458 --> 23:12.417
NOW THAT I HAVE MY RULES...

23:12.458 --> 23:13.709
MM-HMM.

23:13.750 --> 23:16.417
I DON'T WANT TO BREAK THEM.
YOU KNOW?

23:16.458 --> 23:19.208
YEAH, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.291
(laughs)
I WANT TO KNOW,
BUT, UM, RULES?

23:24.542 --> 23:26.041
SEX RULES.

23:26.083 --> 23:27.500
RULES ABOUT SEX.

23:27.542 --> 23:30.041
YOU KNOW, A HOTEL MEANS
A ROOM, A ROOM MEANS A BED,

23:30.083 --> 23:32.291
A BED MEANS--
YOU HAVE SEX RULES.

23:32.333 --> 23:35.250
I'M WAITING.
UNTIL MARRIAGE?

23:35.291 --> 23:37.041
NO! NO. (laughs)
(laughs)

23:37.083 --> 23:38.250
NO, NO. I--

23:38.291 --> 23:40.959
JUST TILL, UM...

23:42.375 --> 23:46.041
UNTIL IT FEELS RIGHT,
UNTIL I'M... SURE.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.208
OKAY.

23:48.250 --> 23:50.333
SO WE'LL WAIT.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.542
I'M GOOD WITH WAITING.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.917
I'M HAPPY WITH WAITING.
REALLY?

23:54.959 --> 23:56.583
NO, BUT I CAN WAIT.
(laughs)

23:59.583 --> 24:01.583
AND I AM SURE.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.166
GO AWAY.
THIS WILL JUST TAKE
ONE SECOND.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.709
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
YOUR RATIONALIZATIONS.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.959
(knocks on door)

24:23.000 --> 24:25.333
BRADEN MIGHT NOT BE AUTISTIC.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.041
IS THIS SOME SICK IDEA--
NO.

24:31.083 --> 24:33.041
HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING CALLED
LANDAU-KLEFFNER SYNDROME.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.709
IN KIDS LIKE BRADEN, THAT LOSE
THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE,

24:35.750 --> 24:38.375
THEY MIGHT BE HAVING SEIZURES.
AT NIGHT. YOU DON'T NOTICE THEM,

24:38.417 --> 24:41.291
BUT IT CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH
THE SYNAPSES IN THEIR BRAIN.

24:41.333 --> 24:44.250
THEY START MISFIRING. IT IMPAIRS
THEIR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE,

24:44.291 --> 24:46.500
AND WHEN THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE,
THEY WITHDRAW.

24:46.542 --> 24:49.417
AND THE THING IS,
WITH CORTICOSTEROIDS,

24:49.458 --> 24:51.542
WITH ANTICONVULSANTS,
IT MIGHT BE TREATABLE.

24:51.583 --> 24:55.041
THE FIRST PAGE HAS THE NAME OF
THREE EXCELLENT PEDIATRICIANS.

NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

31:26.250 --> 31:29.041

31:29.083 --> 31:31.834
I LOVE MY PARENTS MORE
THAN ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD.

31:31.875 --> 31:34.250
I JUST WANT
TO TAKE THEM HOME.

31:34.291 --> 31:36.250
PLEASE, IF I DON'T BURY
MY PAST,

31:36.291 --> 31:38.500
MY FAMILY WILL HAVE
NO FUTURE.

31:44.208 --> 31:46.250
NO, NO, NO,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
STOP, STOP TALKING.

31:46.291 --> 31:48.250
JUST LISTEN--LISTEN TO
WHAT I'M SAYING.
WAIT, NO, NO, NO.
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT.

31:48.291 --> 31:51.041
YOU GOT ME OUT OF THE MARRIAGE.
NOW WHAT YOU CAN DO

31:51.083 --> 31:53.458
IS YOU AN ADDISON CAN GO AHEAD
AND TAKE OVER THE PRACTICE.
FOR THE LAST TIME--
PROBABLY NOT THE LAST TIME...

31:53.500 --> 31:55.917
MAYBE I'LL GO WORK
OVER AT ST. AMBROSE.
BECAUSE WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE THIS
ARGUMENT MAYBE NINE MORE TIMES

31:55.959 --> 31:58.667
BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY...
NO, REALLY, I'M SURE THAT I
COULD FIND A JOB THERE...

31:58.709 --> 32:01.041
SINCE WE'VE ALREADY HAD IT
THREE TIMES. ADDISON--
IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE'RE TRYING
TO HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.667
I DON'T CARE.

32:02.709 --> 32:04.000
GREAT.

32:10.792 --> 32:13.041
LOOK, MAYBE THIS IS MY FAULT.

32:13.083 --> 32:15.959
I PUSHED US TO TRY
TO RECAPTURE THE PAST,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.250
WHAT WE HAD,
WHAT THIS PLACE USED TO BE.

32:19.291 --> 32:22.250
BUT THE PAST IS CLUTTERED
WITH ANGER AND MISTAKES,

32:22.291 --> 32:24.208
AND WE NEED TO BURY THAT.

32:24.250 --> 32:27.417
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO DID WHAT WHEN.

32:27.458 --> 32:29.208
IT MATTERS
WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW,

32:29.250 --> 32:31.834
WHAT WE WANT THIS PLACE
TO BE GOING FORWARD.

32:31.875 --> 32:34.875
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON PATIENTS,
AND WE NEED TO EARN MONEY.

32:34.917 --> 32:37.291
WE NEED NAOMI AND WE NEED SAM,

32:37.333 --> 32:39.500
THE BEST OF BOTH OF YOU.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.500
AND THIS VOTE,
IT'S A BAD IDEA,

32:41.542 --> 32:44.125
AN IDEA THAT WE MIGHT NEVER
RECOVER FROM.

32:44.166 --> 32:46.083
WE SHOULDN'T DO IT.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.750

32:48.792 --> 32:51.542
WHAT WE WANT
THIS PLACE TO BE, TOGETHER.

32:51.583 --> 32:53.542
IF YOU FORCE US TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN YOU,

32:53.583 --> 32:57.125
THAT WILL CREATE SCARS
THAT WON'T HEAL.

32:57.166 --> 33:00.500
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD,
NOT BACK.

33:09.083 --> 33:11.500
WE VOTE
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

33:48.500 --> 33:51.125
HE'S SO AMERICAN.

33:51.166 --> 33:54.834
HE'S NOT MY FUTURE.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.041
