00:00.998 --> 00:04.058
This Saturday, my sister's getting
married in the Barossa Valley.

00:04.258 --> 00:06.538
- And I want you to call the show.
- Really?

00:06.738 --> 00:08.698
They might not like it, upstairs.

00:08.838 --> 00:10.978
I'm happy to own it.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.538
I don't generally talk about
my private life.

00:13.678 --> 00:16.538
But I am a proud lesbian woman.

00:16.886 --> 00:20.338
I am in a loving long-term relationship.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.578
Oh, my God!

00:21.778 --> 00:23.518
- Hi, I...
- Did you make that call back there?

00:23.698 --> 00:25.818
- Yes.
- Great save. Keep it up.

00:25.958 --> 00:28.458
Are you not that into this?

00:28.598 --> 00:29.698
What?

00:29.838 --> 00:32.458
'Cause I'm really into you.

00:34.498 --> 00:36.698
- I want to be honest.
- You're dating Simone.

00:36.838 --> 00:39.578
I'm not anymore, actually.

00:39.778 --> 00:42.538
If you had feelings for me, why would
you go out with my best friend?

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.438 --> 00:55.258
I can't kiss you back.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.518
If you really love me,

00:59.698 --> 01:01.938
you'll get in the bath with me.

01:04.878 --> 01:07.898
I love you, Lil.

01:12.978 --> 01:16.578
I mean, I feel quite relieved
that I've made a decision finally.

01:16.718 --> 01:18.338
How does this sound?

01:18.478 --> 01:20.258
Hi, my name is Lily Woodward

01:20.458 --> 01:23.898
and I am the new supervising
producer of 'The Breakfast Bar'.

01:24.038 --> 01:26.218
Surprise!

01:34.433 --> 01:35.764
Happy birthday!

01:40.438 --> 01:42.218
So, the big 3-0.

01:42.358 --> 01:43.818
No, not gonna celebrate it.

01:44.018 --> 01:45.898
You can't not do anything.
It's a monumental life event.

01:46.098 --> 01:49.618
I do not want all the people from
all the different facets of my life

01:49.758 --> 01:51.098
in one room together.

01:51.238 --> 01:52.578
Way too messy. Nightmare.

01:52.778 --> 01:57.698
So, if person A and person C have sex,

01:57.898 --> 02:01.538
but then person B, who is also
best friends with person A,

02:01.678 --> 02:04.018
wants to have sex with person C

02:04.218 --> 02:07.298
after person A and C
have already broken up...

02:07.498 --> 02:09.157
- Hmm.
- ...what is the quarantine period?

02:09.338 --> 02:11.818
I don't know. Dudes don't really
have quarantine periods.

02:12.018 --> 02:14.378
We just have sex with
whoever wants to have sex with us.

02:14.578 --> 02:15.978
- Really?
- Kind of.

02:16.118 --> 02:17.818
Is person B you?

02:18.018 --> 02:19.798
- Yes.
- Person A Simone?

02:19.998 --> 02:22.378
- Yes.
- Person C's Jack the chef?

02:22.578 --> 02:24.978
- How did you know that?
- I just did.

02:26.578 --> 02:30.618
Yeah, I would say that you cannot
consider the chef romantically

02:30.758 --> 02:32.978
for months, if not years.

02:33.118 --> 02:34.618
Actually, definitely years.

02:34.818 --> 02:37.438
That is a really long quarantine period.

02:37.638 --> 02:40.438
- It's just how it is.
- Wow.

02:40.638 --> 02:41.978
Is Mitchell still hanging around?

02:42.118 --> 02:43.798
Gone way beyond hanging around.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.618
I'm in a permanent three-way,
except not the fun sort.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.438
And he's, like, operating
as my life coach now.

02:49.638 --> 02:51.458
Have you ever thought about
setting yourself KPIs?

02:51.658 --> 02:53.798
You know, so you can keep track
of how you're performing?

02:53.918 --> 02:55.258
Uh, nope!

02:55.398 --> 02:57.018
Yeah, I think it'd be a good idea.

02:58.902 --> 03:00.798
- Do you know who you are?
- Who?

03:00.998 --> 03:03.833
You are the Lady Diana
of this relationship.

03:03.858 --> 03:05.378
Yeah, and look what happened to her.

03:06.658 --> 03:09.498
It'll be a pretty short meeting
because she doesn't want a party

03:09.698 --> 03:11.298
and she definitely
doesn't want a surprise party.

03:11.498 --> 03:14.438
- That's what she says.
- Because that's what she means.

03:14.638 --> 03:17.153
- You're so literal.
- No, I'm with Sim.

03:17.178 --> 03:19.078
Every year Lil says
she doesn't want to do anything

03:19.278 --> 03:21.798
and then she's devastated when
we don't actually do anything.

03:21.978 --> 03:23.978
- OK.
- I like the new look.

03:24.178 --> 03:26.078
Oh, thanks. Mum thought
a doctor with a beard

03:26.198 --> 03:27.858
looked a little untrustworthy.

03:27.998 --> 03:29.378
Yeah, she's probably right.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.218
What's Jack doing here?

03:32.358 --> 03:35.018
Didn't you guys break up?

03:35.158 --> 03:36.898
Yeah, but now we're friends.

03:37.098 --> 03:38.978
Friends who plan
surprise parties together?

03:39.178 --> 03:42.018
I needed somebody
to invite Lily's workmates.

03:44.738 --> 03:46.298
- Hey.
- Hello.

03:46.498 --> 03:48.698
- Hi, mate. How's things?
- Hey, mate. Good.

03:48.988 --> 03:51.698
- Hi. Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for inviting me.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.298
So, how... what...
How's this gonna work?

03:57.498 --> 04:00.078
Well, Vincent,
you will invite the family.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.798
Pete, uni mates.

04:01.998 --> 04:04.438
And, Jack, you can invite
friends from work.

04:04.558 --> 04:06.018
And then I'll fill in the blanks.

04:06.218 --> 04:07.978
Lily explicitly said
she didn't want people

04:08.178 --> 04:09.898
from all facets of her life in one room.

04:10.098 --> 04:12.158
Who does? But that's what a party is.

04:12.338 --> 04:14.498
Now I did the flowers
at this 80th last week

04:14.698 --> 04:17.178
and I think the venue
had a perfect Lily vibe.

04:17.378 --> 04:20.298
So, Jack, um, could you do, maybe, food?

04:20.498 --> 04:22.438
- No worries.
- Great.

04:22.638 --> 04:26.158
I also need some help styling the venue.

04:26.278 --> 04:27.978
Yeah, I can help with that.

04:29.378 --> 04:30.338
Yeah.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.738
So, who's gonna get Lily there?

04:32.938 --> 04:36.298
Well, I'm on a dishonesty detox
at the moment, so it can't be me.

04:36.438 --> 04:38.078
I think it should be you, Jack.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.718
She's not gonna suspect
the surprise party coming from you.

04:40.838 --> 04:42.178
Happy to help.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.378
Jack.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.178
Is it weird throwing a party
for your ex-girlfriend's flatmate?

04:49.378 --> 04:51.498
Are you having a go at me, mate?

04:51.698 --> 04:55.658
Oh, not at all. Just,
it must be weird, that's all.

04:55.858 --> 04:58.818
I'm organising a party for
a colleague who's become a friend.

04:58.958 --> 05:00.618
OK.

05:07.158 --> 05:09.438
- What are we cooking this week?
- An Ottolenghi dish.

05:09.558 --> 05:11.698
Mmm. I love Ottolenghi.

05:11.898 --> 05:14.938
- Do you?
- Yeah, it's yummy.

05:15.138 --> 05:17.298
- Do you buy yours fresh?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

05:20.098 --> 05:22.798
Do you wanna head out on the
weekend? I hear it's your birthday.

05:24.018 --> 05:25.578
I... I can't.

05:25.778 --> 05:28.218
Oh. OK.

05:28.418 --> 05:30.378
It's because of the quarantine period.

05:30.518 --> 05:32.298
I don't know what that means.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.498
It means you're Simone's ex and I...

05:35.698 --> 05:38.378
...I can't be with you
for a really long time.

05:38.518 --> 05:41.338
Then why did you kiss me?

05:41.478 --> 05:43.738
I did the wrong thing.

05:43.938 --> 05:45.738
How long is this quarantine period?

05:45.878 --> 05:47.378
I don't know, but...

05:47.578 --> 05:51.258
But I do know that the ramifications
are very serious if I break it.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.738
It's kind of a friendship by-law.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.538
I wouldn't want to break a by-law,

05:55.738 --> 05:58.178
but if the by-law changes,
you let me know.

05:58.318 --> 06:00.018
I will.

06:08.218 --> 06:10.218
I asked her out but she said no.

06:10.418 --> 06:11.938
Something about a quarantine period.

06:12.078 --> 06:13.438
What? That's madness!

06:13.618 --> 06:15.438
Anyway, you're gonna
have to get her to the party.

06:15.558 --> 06:16.798
Will do. What time d'ya want her there?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.738
Five? That gives us time.

06:18.938 --> 06:21.518
I'll put some money behind the bar.
What about music?

06:21.698 --> 06:24.798
Oh, whatever the shittiest,
most disposable pop music there is,

06:24.918 --> 06:26.258
that's what Lily listens to.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.538
Whatever 13-year-old white girls
listen to.

06:28.738 --> 06:30.898
Well, could you put
the music playlist together?

06:31.038 --> 06:33.778
Oh, I could, but she'd hate it.

06:33.978 --> 06:36.158
Could you do something she'd like?

06:36.338 --> 06:40.138
Yeah, that'd be incredibly painful,
but, yes, I'll sort it out.

06:40.338 --> 06:43.538
What's the deal with you and Lily?

06:43.678 --> 06:46.258
Mates.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.498
- That's all?
- That's all.

06:48.698 --> 06:51.018
Alright, I'll, uh...
I'll see you at the party.

06:54.198 --> 06:57.977
- Ah, Lily! I'm glad I caught you.
- Oh, hi. Good to see you, Craig.

06:58.078 --> 07:01.258
I never thought I'd see the day that
Erica was more popular than Eric.

07:01.398 --> 07:02.738
And that's thanks to you.

07:02.938 --> 07:05.098
Her coming out on television
made quite the impact.

07:05.238 --> 07:06.658
Mmm, mmm.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.218
Here at the network we're interested
in investing in people.

07:13.418 --> 07:15.798
You have any idea who I'm talking about?

07:15.918 --> 07:17.438
No...

07:19.438 --> 07:22.098
Ah. It's you.

07:22.298 --> 07:24.658
You're someone we'd wanna invest in.

07:24.858 --> 07:27.093
I think you'd make a fantastic
supervising producer

07:27.118 --> 07:28.498
on 'The Breakfast Bar'.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.858
- Wow! Thank you. Wow.
- Yeah.

07:30.998 --> 07:32.898
Are you interested?

07:33.038 --> 07:35.378
Yes, I am.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.938
Wonderful. Marvellous.

07:40.258 --> 07:43.718
Oh, needless to say, let's just...
keep it among ourselves, eh?

07:43.838 --> 07:45.718
Of course. Sure.

07:59.016 --> 08:01.196
Minimal. Minimal look.

08:01.467 --> 08:03.396
- You've heard of minimalism?
- Yeah.

08:03.475 --> 08:04.727
Bernard.

08:04.927 --> 08:06.727
- How are you, mate?
- Oh, really well.

08:06.927 --> 08:08.862
You good? This is Anouk.
I work with her.

08:08.887 --> 08:10.144
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

08:10.253 --> 08:12.807
This is Pete. So...

08:13.007 --> 08:15.122
- I'll go put these photos online.
- Yep, definitely.

08:15.147 --> 08:16.687
I'll see you later.

08:17.947 --> 08:20.087
- So, come with me.
- Ah, thanks.

08:20.287 --> 08:22.507
- Much work on?
- Ah, not as much as I'd like.

08:22.807 --> 08:25.147
Um... Look, I'm gonna cut
straight to the point.

08:25.347 --> 08:27.256
- Please, yeah.
- I know you and I haven't really seen

08:27.280 --> 08:29.146
- eye to eye over the years.
- Oh...

08:29.147 --> 08:30.667
We've never really liked each other.

08:30.807 --> 08:32.427
Sorry... sorry you see it that way.

08:32.626 --> 08:34.107
We've always had
a bit of back and forth,

08:34.307 --> 08:36.827
a bit of banter that's often
bordered on open hostility.

08:37.027 --> 08:39.027
Oh, I've always enjoyed our sparring.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.076
I always thought
it was pretty funny but...

08:41.248 --> 08:43.107
- But that's cool.
- Yeah, anyway, I...

08:43.307 --> 08:45.707
Yeah, how can I help?
Like, what's the dealio?

08:45.907 --> 08:49.247
You said that you might have some articles
that you didn't have time to write.

08:49.367 --> 08:50.707
I don't want to write.

08:50.907 --> 08:53.267
I don't want to write.
Pete, music journalism is over.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.607
It's done, alright,
social networking, blogs,

08:56.807 --> 08:59.147
the whole freakin' internet
has just taken music journalism

08:59.347 --> 09:00.627
and just smashed it into the ground.

09:00.827 --> 09:03.147
You know, which means that
people like you can't get work.

09:03.287 --> 09:04.147
Yeah.

09:04.347 --> 09:06.547
But if you come see
people like me, we can change that,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.987
and that, my friend,
is where apps come in.

09:09.187 --> 09:11.967
And that's where the people
that I work for make their money.

09:12.087 --> 09:14.707
You ever created an app, Pete?

09:14.907 --> 09:18.387
- Uh, no. No, I haven't.
- Jump in.

09:18.527 --> 09:20.187
Yeah, the people I work for,

09:20.387 --> 09:23.887
they insist on keeping this
music journalism just limping along.

09:24.087 --> 09:26.667
You know, it's the least important
part of their business.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.547
- They don't spend any money on it.
- Right.

09:28.747 --> 09:30.427
But it still needs to be written,
doesn't it?

09:30.627 --> 09:32.967
- Even if literally nobody reads it.
- Uh...

09:33.147 --> 09:34.827
You interested in writing something
that nobody reads?

09:35.027 --> 09:38.307
Um... I'm interested
in writing about music.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.667
Yeah. Good.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.667
Um, well, there's a job
that pays peanuts

09:41.807 --> 09:43.387
that's yours if you want it,

09:43.527 --> 09:46.067
because... I like you.

09:46.267 --> 09:49.147
- Thank you.
- You're a good kid.

09:54.387 --> 09:56.907
I arrived home,
clearly without my balls,

09:57.107 --> 09:58.967
but still hoping to have
a restful night at home.

09:59.087 --> 10:01.147
Hey, guess what. I got a job!

10:01.287 --> 10:05.067
That's great! Well done, mate.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.787
Oh, thanks. Is, um... is Meredith here?

10:07.987 --> 10:10.607
Just gone to the shops. Good work.

10:10.807 --> 10:13.387
- He's never going away.
- I like Mitchell.

10:13.527 --> 10:14.887
Any woman would be into him.

10:15.087 --> 10:17.267
Thank you, Lily, that's really helpful.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.967
OK. Do you want my thoughts on this?

10:21.147 --> 10:24.327
You're gonna give them to me.
I know you love giving advice.

10:24.507 --> 10:26.507
Of course it's OK
to break up over the phone.

10:26.707 --> 10:30.187
She'll probably appreciate
not having to see you in person.

10:30.327 --> 10:33.507
- But not if she's crazy.

10:33.707 --> 10:36.507
OK, Mitchell, he's either the nanny

10:36.532 --> 10:38.107
from the
'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'

10:38.132 --> 10:40.187
and will ultimately kill
and replace you,

10:40.387 --> 10:42.747
or he's just a really nice guy.

10:42.947 --> 10:45.267
Yeah, see, I'm not sure
which of those is worse.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.827
Anyway, how about you?
You gonna take the new job?

10:49.027 --> 10:53.027
Mmm, I want to, but no-one's
mentioned what's happening to Sasha.

10:53.227 --> 10:54.747
I assume she's going onto another show,

10:54.947 --> 10:56.247
'cause that's what usually happens.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.027
- Is that what they said?
- No-one's mentioned her.

11:09.607 --> 11:11.643
One Turkish, one Egyptian...

11:13.107 --> 11:14.467
Craig.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.602
- Lily!
- Hello.

11:16.839 --> 11:19.627
Could I have an off-the-record
conversation with you?

11:19.767 --> 11:21.607
Of course, yeah.

11:21.807 --> 11:26.627
If I accept the job,
where does that leave Sasha?

11:28.187 --> 11:31.667
Well, it leaves her free
to follow her dreams.

11:31.807 --> 11:34.467
To develop shows with you, or...?

11:34.667 --> 11:36.527
Well, I mean that's
certainly a possibility.

11:36.727 --> 11:38.467
- A likely one?
- No.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.787
- Have you made your decision?
- No.

11:41.987 --> 11:44.267
Sasha's been a great mentor to me

11:44.467 --> 11:47.027
and I feel really uncomfortable
about taking her job.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.147
Hmm. Well, it's not her job.

11:49.347 --> 11:52.307
And you not taking it doesn't mean
that Sasha will keep it.

11:52.507 --> 11:56.627
Change is good, Lily. It's good, OK?

11:56.827 --> 11:59.467
I mean, it's important. It's good
for everyone. It keeps things fresh.

11:59.607 --> 12:01.747
I've been here for 20 years,

12:01.947 --> 12:04.467
and I envy people who can just
move on to other shows

12:04.607 --> 12:05.947
and, you know, other networks.

12:06.147 --> 12:07.627
It's a shame you're not leaving then.

12:09.247 --> 12:11.527
Sorry, that was a joke. A very bad one.

12:11.727 --> 12:14.107
Um, I will let you know
by the end of the week.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.175
- Sasha wants to see you.
- Why?

12:21.286 --> 12:23.190
I don't know.

12:24.527 --> 12:25.887
Have a seat.

12:27.807 --> 12:29.787
You need to apologise to me.

12:31.907 --> 12:33.547
OK.

12:33.747 --> 12:36.267
You need to say a big fat sorry to me

12:36.467 --> 12:38.827
for keeping these ideas to yourself.

12:39.027 --> 12:41.527
I've just seen your last segment
pitches and they're perfect.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.027
They're topical, they're
entertaining and surprising.

12:44.167 --> 12:47.307
Thank you.

12:47.507 --> 12:49.067
Where do you want to go
in this business?

12:49.207 --> 12:51.187
I-I don't know.

12:51.327 --> 12:53.387
It's your life, it's your career.

12:53.587 --> 12:56.608
You've got to steer the ship, you gotta
grab opportunities that come your way.

12:56.702 --> 12:59.420
Decide where you want to go and then
work at how you're gonna get there.

13:01.107 --> 13:02.467
Thank you.

13:06.747 --> 13:10.347
Uh, can I, uh... Can I speak
to you about something?

13:12.887 --> 13:14.247
Yeah.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.107
I think I'm being replaced.

13:21.247 --> 13:24.267
I've heard some rumours.

13:24.467 --> 13:27.387
The thing is, who would
they replace me with?

13:30.689 --> 13:34.035
Craig wants me to take
the supervising producer's job.

13:34.175 --> 13:35.795
Is Sasha moving on?

13:35.935 --> 13:39.115
Sasha is being moved on.

13:39.355 --> 13:41.495
I don't know what to do.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.375
She's been such a great mentor to me,

13:43.575 --> 13:46.415
but I'm not sure that not taking
the job is gonna save her.

13:46.615 --> 13:49.535
- Don't shaft her.
- That's not what I am doing.

13:49.675 --> 13:51.015
I've been offered a job

13:51.215 --> 13:53.095
and I'm trying to decide
whether or not to take it.

13:53.295 --> 13:56.135
I know you think right now is your
only chance, but I am telling you,

13:56.335 --> 13:58.855
you're gonna get other opportunities
you can take without hurting anyone.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.295
OK, you know what, I've changed my mind.

14:01.495 --> 14:03.415
I don't want to talk to you about this.

14:03.615 --> 14:05.175
- Just...
- Shut up. I'm not hungry.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.495
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:13.915 --> 14:16.095
I've been offered a promotion.

14:17.555 --> 14:18.895
What is it?

14:19.095 --> 14:21.535
Supervising producer
of 'The Breakfast Bar'.

14:21.735 --> 14:25.775
That's great! Congratulations!
You want it, don't you?

14:25.915 --> 14:28.455
I really want it.

14:28.655 --> 14:33.055
I mean, I'm terrified, but I have all
these ideas for great new segments.

14:33.195 --> 14:35.995
And... yeah, I think I'm ready.

14:36.195 --> 14:38.775
Well, grab onto it with both hands.

14:38.915 --> 14:40.295
You deserve it.

14:40.495 --> 14:42.295
Thank you.

14:42.495 --> 14:45.175
Hmm, that's Vincent.
We're gonna hang out.

14:46.855 --> 14:49.535
I wonder when the last time was
that Vincent had sex.

14:49.735 --> 14:52.495
Do not have sex with my brother.

14:52.695 --> 14:54.815
Does that mean he can't have sex?
Does it, you know, work?

14:55.015 --> 14:57.415
How would I know?
I haven't asked him. Oh, you sicko.

14:57.555 --> 14:59.215
Maybe he doesn't know.

14:59.415 --> 15:01.575
He is off limits to you. I mean it.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.055
You're very controlling
of your brother's penis.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.635
Better me than you.

15:05.755 --> 15:06.855
That's weird.

15:06.995 --> 15:08.255
'Bye.

15:10.645 --> 15:11.990
I gotta say I never thought

15:12.015 --> 15:14.175
I'd be making my sister's name
in flowers.

15:14.375 --> 15:17.135
Which is odd, because
you're very good at it.

15:17.275 --> 15:19.355
Ah, it's the surgeon hands.

15:22.895 --> 15:25.375
You know, today is my 2-year
anniversary of my accident.

15:27.055 --> 15:29.715
For Lily's 28th,
I was in intensive care.

15:29.835 --> 15:32.375
I know. I visited you.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.375
Did you?

15:35.575 --> 15:36.935
Yeah.

15:39.415 --> 15:42.535
You know, I miss it, kite surfing. I do.

15:42.910 --> 15:45.350
Even though it did this to me.
It's stupid, but...

15:45.550 --> 15:48.030
The day it happened it was pretty windy.

15:48.055 --> 15:51.015
It was about 40 knots
and we were stoked.

15:52.835 --> 15:54.915
When you go out on your board,
you're completely focused.

15:55.115 --> 15:59.395
You're only thinking about your next
trick or how fast you can go.

15:59.535 --> 16:05.095
You feel... absolutely free.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.555
I felt great.

16:06.755 --> 16:09.155
And then the wind took me up and...

16:13.375 --> 16:15.995
I went so high, I was flying.

16:16.195 --> 16:17.835
I must have known
it wasn't gonna end well.

16:19.435 --> 16:21.355
But for those few seconds, I felt...

16:23.035 --> 16:24.955
...bliss.

16:27.815 --> 16:29.555
I used to be a doctor

16:29.695 --> 16:31.635
and a kite surfer.

16:31.835 --> 16:34.375
And now I'm nothing. I'm neither.

16:34.575 --> 16:39.115
You are still a doctor
and you will get a job.

17:03.955 --> 17:05.635
- Uh-oh.
- Hey!

17:05.660 --> 17:07.234
- How you going, mate?
- Yeah, good, good.

17:07.435 --> 17:09.035
Just updating
the weekend's gigs on the app.

17:09.175 --> 17:10.515
Yeah, you're cool doing that?

17:10.714 --> 17:11.755
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:11.954 --> 17:13.555
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:14.755 --> 17:17.835
- Yep, got to be done. Got to be done.
- Yeah.

17:17.974 --> 17:19.675
Cool, coolio.

17:22.595 --> 17:25.635
Oh, I was thinking, we should go for
a drink this weekend to celebrate.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.315
Uh, celebrate... what?

17:28.515 --> 17:31.755
Um, us, working together finally.

17:32.955 --> 17:34.635
- Oh... Oh...
- Yes!

17:34.835 --> 17:36.555
You know what, I've got
Lily's birthday drinks.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.915
That's fine, that'll do.
That'll work perfectly. That's good.

17:39.115 --> 17:40.395
No, I actually I didn't mean...

17:40.595 --> 17:42.195
No, no, I don't mind
combining with Lily's birthday.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.795
That's good. I haven't seen her in ages.

17:43.995 --> 17:46.235
- Yeah, it's just that...
- Text me the address.

17:46.375 --> 17:47.675
Thanks, mate. See you soon.

17:54.435 --> 17:56.275
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.835
Mitchell was just about to shout us
some takeaway. What would you like?

18:00.035 --> 18:02.515
- The chilli beef is always good.
- Or the pad thai.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.455
- Or the green papaya salad.
- Or the choo chee fish.

18:04.635 --> 18:07.475
You know what, Mitchell, this whole
situation is just getting a bit much.

18:09.575 --> 18:11.235
What are you talking about, Pete?

18:11.435 --> 18:13.095
No, Meredith, let him... let him speak.

18:13.215 --> 18:15.515
Uh, in what way?

18:15.715 --> 18:19.875
In the way that you're always here,
or on the phone.

18:21.795 --> 18:24.315
I'm happy for you and Meredith
and I want to show my support.

18:24.515 --> 18:26.835
Yeah. You're just showing it
a little bit too much.

18:27.035 --> 18:30.195
- Pete...
- No, no. No, Meredith.

18:32.755 --> 18:35.915
OK, for the record,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.795
I was elated when I heard
Meredith was pregnant

18:38.995 --> 18:42.115
because it was something
I could never give her.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.195
And even though as a man
I felt like a failure,

18:46.335 --> 18:47.995
and still do,

18:48.195 --> 18:53.195
but I'm glad that she's got
what we both wanted so badly.

18:53.335 --> 18:54.835
But if I'm doing anything

18:55.035 --> 18:57.455
to jeopardise
your relationship with her,

18:57.575 --> 18:59.475
then please forgive me.

18:59.675 --> 19:01.915
And know that from this moment,
I'll step right away.

19:06.115 --> 19:08.195
- No, you don't have to...
- No, I do.

19:08.395 --> 19:11.475
I've already failed her once.
I don't want to fail her again.

19:12.978 --> 19:14.915
So I asked him to be the godfather.

19:15.115 --> 19:16.835
- What?!
- Yep, that's what I did.

19:17.035 --> 19:19.095
- What did he say?
- Oh, he didn't say anything.

19:19.150 --> 19:21.115
He was hugging me so hard
that words were unnecessary.

19:25.595 --> 19:26.995
Wow.

19:28.655 --> 19:30.935
Oh, birthday texts.

19:31.135 --> 19:33.055
Turns out I'm more popular
than I thought I was.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.535
Can I wish you happy birthday yet?

19:34.735 --> 19:37.635
No. It's not technically my birthday
for another... five minutes.

19:37.835 --> 19:39.635
No, I'm calling it, Woodward.
Happy birthday.

19:39.755 --> 19:41.215
Thanks.

19:41.415 --> 19:44.275
Can we just go back to my place?
I don't want to go to putt-putt.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.275
I've already rigged
the second hole on the jungle trail.

19:46.475 --> 19:48.495
But we could go home,
put on 'Embarrassing Bodies'

19:48.695 --> 19:50.935
and skull a beer every time
someone shows their genitals.

19:51.075 --> 19:52.415
Got a keg in your house?

19:52.615 --> 19:54.275
You're gonna need
a lot of beer. Come on.

19:54.475 --> 19:57.095
I'll even pretend to be excited
when you get your hole-in-one, eh?

19:57.295 --> 19:59.015
Craig Petersen said not to say anything

19:59.155 --> 20:00.635
to Sasha about the job offer,

20:00.755 --> 20:02.135
but I have to talk to her.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.055
They should've let her go
before offering it to you.

20:04.255 --> 20:05.655
- I know.
- Are you gonna take it?

20:05.795 --> 20:07.335
Yeah. Yep, I am.

20:07.535 --> 20:09.495
- But I am gonna talk to her first.
- Huh.

20:09.695 --> 20:11.415
- I owe that to her.
- Well, congratulations.

20:11.615 --> 20:13.375
Sounds like from now on
the drinks are on you.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.030
- The drinks are always on me.
- Really?

20:15.055 --> 20:17.015
You offering? We should go in here.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.655
- No.
- Yeah.

20:18.855 --> 20:20.855
- Come on.
- I mean...

20:21.055 --> 20:23.855
I feel quite relieved that I've made
a decision finally, you know.

20:23.995 --> 20:25.535
How does this sound?

20:25.675 --> 20:27.495
Hi, my name is Lily Woodward,

20:27.695 --> 20:30.415
and I am the new supervising
producer of 'The Breakfast Bar'.

20:30.555 --> 20:32.815
Surprise!

20:41.915 --> 20:43.455
Happy birthday!

20:47.233 --> 20:49.033
Sasha!

20:52.524 --> 20:56.084
Craig offered me the job
and I've decided to accept it.

20:56.284 --> 20:59.264
I was gonna talk to you
about it this week.

20:59.464 --> 21:02.864
I have mentored you and championed you

21:03.064 --> 21:05.084
since the day you began working
at 'The Breakfast Bar'.

21:05.284 --> 21:08.304
- I know.
- No! No, you don't know.

21:08.444 --> 21:10.164
You don't know at all.

21:11.284 --> 21:14.184
Your first stories? Rubbish.

21:14.324 --> 21:15.704
Rubbish!

21:15.844 --> 21:17.864
And I fixed those stories.

21:18.064 --> 21:22.084
I sat down with the editor
after you left and I recut them.

21:22.284 --> 21:24.704
You told me they were cut for time.

21:24.904 --> 21:28.804
Yeah, because I didn't want
to destroy your confidence.

21:28.924 --> 21:31.524
I wanted to build you up,

21:31.704 --> 21:37.104
so that one day you would be the
producer I thought you could be.

21:37.304 --> 21:40.664
But a skilled producer
has ethics and integrity.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.864
Now I can see you've got neither.

21:47.024 --> 21:49.804
I don't know what to say. I...

21:50.004 --> 21:52.344
If you take my job, it's...

21:57.744 --> 22:00.664
There's a party with your
name on it happening inside.

22:00.864 --> 22:02.704
So are you involved in this too?

22:02.904 --> 22:05.664
- Are you all in it together?
- I'm not involved in anything, Sasha.

22:05.864 --> 22:08.804
- Why don't I call you a taxi?
- Why don't you piss off?

22:08.924 --> 22:11.824
I can't breathe. I feel sick.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.304
I don't like women like that.

22:13.504 --> 22:16.304
- Just get me home. I'm shaking.
- No, no, listen to me.

22:16.504 --> 22:19.944
That was very unfortunate,
but she's gone now, alright?

22:20.144 --> 22:23.304
Now, all these people are here
because they love you. I love you.

22:23.504 --> 22:26.264
You need to pull yourself together
and go back out there for your party.

22:26.464 --> 22:28.944
- Alright?
- I thought I was going to putt-putt.

22:29.144 --> 22:31.824
You think I wasn't gonna be
all over that?

22:32.024 --> 22:33.664
Alright, now,
would a glass of wine help?

22:33.864 --> 22:35.164
- Yes.
- OK.

22:35.284 --> 22:36.904
Just a bottle.

22:49.524 --> 22:51.164
Lily, you OK?

22:51.344 --> 22:53.373
- Is Sasha definitely gone?
- Yep.

22:54.810 --> 22:56.470
Did you organise all of this?

22:56.759 --> 22:58.715
Yeah, and Jack and Simone and Vincent.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.744
- Jack?
- And Simone and Vincent, yeah.

23:01.944 --> 23:04.264
- Thanks.
- You look gorgeous.

23:04.464 --> 23:06.704
- Thank you. Sim styled me.
- Mm-hm.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.864
So where's Meredith?

23:09.064 --> 23:12.144
Uh, she's over there talking
to your dad about chakras.

23:12.284 --> 23:13.624
Oh, my God.

23:13.824 --> 23:15.184
- How old is she again?
- 42.

23:15.384 --> 23:16.984
Let's hope she's too old for him.

23:17.184 --> 23:18.824
He likes a 40-year age gap.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.824
You shouldn't feel bad.

23:20.964 --> 23:23.264
In this business, sometimes...

23:23.464 --> 23:26.944
...sometimes you're forced
to knife someone in the back.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.144
I've always considered it self-defence.

23:29.344 --> 23:32.344
- I didn't knife anybody.
- Well...

23:32.484 --> 23:33.864
Yay! Yay!

23:34.064 --> 23:36.084
Your lipstick is gorgeous!

23:36.284 --> 23:38.464
And that is a hard colour
for a blonde to pull off.

23:38.604 --> 23:40.224
I'm glad you took the risk.

23:40.424 --> 23:43.384
And don't worry about Sasha. No-one
likes you when you're in that job.

23:43.524 --> 23:44.864
She's probably relieved.

23:45.064 --> 23:47.144
You do realise
that's going to be my job?

23:48.344 --> 23:49.824
- Hey. Drink?
- Yes.

23:50.024 --> 23:52.224
Apparently my lipstick is brave.

23:52.424 --> 23:54.259
- What? It's great.
- I think it looks good.

23:54.284 --> 23:56.804
- Would you kiss these lips?
- Uh, yeah.

24:01.784 --> 24:04.944
Dale, do you think it's bad
that I took Sasha's job?

24:05.144 --> 24:07.824
You didn't take Sasha's job.
You accepted a promotion.

24:07.964 --> 24:11.024
Oh! See? I love you, Dale.

24:11.224 --> 24:12.804
Oh, that wasn't the response I expected.

24:13.984 --> 24:15.744
Good, good, uh... Excuse me, everyone.

24:15.944 --> 24:19.464
Sorry, sorry.
Could I get your attention there?

24:19.604 --> 24:21.084
Hello, everyone.

24:21.284 --> 24:24.464
Yeah, that was a bit of a dramatic
start to the party, wasn't it?

24:24.664 --> 24:27.104
It's what you call
a true surprise party.

24:27.304 --> 24:30.584
Anyway, um, look, Lily hates speeches

24:30.784 --> 24:32.724
and she especially hates my speeches.

24:32.924 --> 24:36.304
But given she's turning 30
and she's my best mate,

24:36.504 --> 24:38.664
I figured what the hell,
it's kind of my duty.

24:38.864 --> 24:41.344
Also, I was looking through
things during the week,

24:41.544 --> 24:46.904
and I dug up a list that
Lily gave me when she was 21

24:47.104 --> 24:50.804
of all the things that she hoped
to achieve by the time she was 30.

24:50.984 --> 24:52.804
Number one.

24:52.984 --> 24:54.724
"Backpack to all seven continents."

24:54.924 --> 24:57.464
Oh, that's probably only possible
if you actually purchase

24:57.664 --> 25:00.859
a backpack in the first place,
isn't it, so no tick there.

25:00.884 --> 25:02.399
"Run a marathon."

25:02.424 --> 25:04.719
A lot of fitness-based goals
on here, which is interesting,

25:04.744 --> 25:08.020
given I've barely seen Lils
get beyond much of a brisk walk.

25:08.045 --> 25:09.139
I can run.

25:09.164 --> 25:10.664
"Make love to a Frenchman."

25:10.864 --> 25:13.184
So if there's any Frenchmen
in the audience

25:13.324 --> 25:14.664
or if you got any French lineage...

25:18.864 --> 25:22.624
But there was one last thing
on the list, um,

25:22.824 --> 25:25.224
and that was to have been
a great friend.

25:25.424 --> 25:28.184
And I'm sure everyone here
would agree with me, Lily,

25:28.384 --> 25:31.224
that you've... you've
well over-achieved in that.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.344
You're, um...

25:36.424 --> 25:40.384
You're thoughtful and kind and brilliant

25:40.584 --> 25:45.824
and fierce and funny and fair
and smart and...

25:46.024 --> 25:49.504
You mean the world to me and I love you.

25:51.364 --> 25:55.464
Um, yeah, so here's to Lily.

25:56.584 --> 25:57.984
To Lily.

26:01.224 --> 26:03.784
And now her other best friend,
Simone, is gonna say a few words.

26:03.984 --> 26:05.664
- Simi.
- Thank you.

26:05.864 --> 26:09.544
Um, now we would like Lily to respond.

26:09.744 --> 26:11.864
And we're going to ask her to respond

26:12.064 --> 26:15.384
in a language
that she knows very well...

26:15.524 --> 26:18.384
...the language of dance.

26:20.604 --> 26:22.664
No, no, no, no, no, no. Sim!

26:22.804 --> 26:25.824
Come on! To the stage!

27:21.584 --> 27:23.084
Fantastic.

27:25.004 --> 27:26.464
I love you.

27:29.464 --> 27:32.384
Your floral designs are amazing.

27:32.524 --> 27:34.724
Mmm! Thank you.

27:34.924 --> 27:38.084
Your, um, baby bump is amazing.

27:38.284 --> 27:39.664
How are you feeling?

27:39.864 --> 27:42.704
I'm well, I'm really well.
I'm just tired.

27:42.844 --> 27:44.824
I've been sitting here watching.

27:45.024 --> 27:48.104
Which one is the guy that Lily likes?

27:48.244 --> 27:50.304
Oh, no-one.

27:50.504 --> 27:52.584
I'm the one who wants
to get her a birthday pash.

27:52.784 --> 27:55.116
- She's not up for it.
- No, no, there is someone.

27:55.141 --> 27:58.104
Pete was telling me
there's some guy at work.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.744
Don't think so.

27:59.813 --> 28:02.144
The only one she hangs out
with at work is, um...

28:03.384 --> 28:06.144
...uh, Dale.

28:06.284 --> 28:09.384
Oh, not him. No.

28:09.584 --> 28:13.744
It's the chef! That's it.
Oh, I can't remember his name.

28:13.944 --> 28:16.464
- Jack?
- Yes, that's him.

28:16.604 --> 28:17.984
Which one is he?

28:19.524 --> 28:22.304
Um... there.

28:23.664 --> 28:27.544
Oh, uh... Hmm, he's handsome.

28:27.684 --> 28:29.904
I can see the attraction.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.464
Yep.

28:36.473 --> 28:39.007
- Hey, hey.
- Shall we?

28:39.920 --> 28:42.060
- Yes, we shall.
- All right, mate.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.087
Lil, have a shot.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.927
No, thanks. I'm trying
to keep myself nice.

28:46.127 --> 28:48.247
Have one, have one, have one. Have one.

28:48.447 --> 28:50.287
- One shot.
- Alright, one.

28:53.607 --> 28:54.967
- Oh!
- Oh!

28:55.167 --> 28:57.287
- Guess who!
- Uh...

28:57.427 --> 28:59.207
I don't know.

28:59.407 --> 29:01.487
- Come on, guess.
- I...

29:01.687 --> 29:04.047
- I really don't know.
- Just one guess.

29:04.247 --> 29:06.547
- Eric?
- No! It's me, Bernard.

29:06.747 --> 29:10.267
- Oh, Bernard, hi. How...
- Happy birthday!

29:10.447 --> 29:12.047
I didn't realise that you were coming.

29:12.247 --> 29:14.127
- Hug it out, yeah.
- Oh, amazing.

29:14.327 --> 29:16.907
- Hey, buddy, what's up?
- Yeah, good.

29:17.087 --> 29:20.767
- Yeah, I got you a present.
- You didn't have to do that.

29:20.967 --> 29:24.767
Yeah, it's a mix tape.
Yeah, well, a modern equivalent.

29:24.967 --> 29:27.407
I got all my favourite songs,
put them on a hard drive,

29:27.607 --> 29:30.367
and I haven't done a count but
there's probably 32,000 songs on there.

29:30.567 --> 29:33.087
Wow! Thank you so much. That's lovely.

29:33.227 --> 29:34.927
Awesome party by the way.

29:35.127 --> 29:37.547
It's so good! I love an open bar.

29:37.727 --> 29:39.207
I think it's just beer and wine.

29:39.407 --> 29:41.407
- That's all I'm drinking.
- And only till 11, so...

29:41.607 --> 29:43.742
Cool. Hurry up, Bernard! Get a move on.

29:43.767 --> 29:45.407
Oh!

29:45.607 --> 29:47.647
- Cool, yeah.
- Oh, thanks.

29:51.967 --> 29:54.727
Can you slow it down
a little bit, darling?

29:54.927 --> 29:56.927
Let him have a bit of fun, darl.

29:57.127 --> 29:59.327
Anthony, I would love him
to have some fun.

29:59.527 --> 30:01.687
I just don't want him to have fun
that he'll get hurt.

30:01.887 --> 30:05.907
You have no idea
what our life is like. God!

30:06.027 --> 30:08.767
I want him to have some fun.

30:08.967 --> 30:11.547
Whatever I say, it's the wrong thing.

30:11.667 --> 30:13.287
It's not you, Dad.

30:13.427 --> 30:15.067
She's just... She's exhausted.

30:15.187 --> 30:16.887
No, it is me.

30:18.407 --> 30:20.187
But thanks for saying that.

30:21.387 --> 30:22.827
Thank you.

30:30.487 --> 30:32.607
Did you organise all of this?

30:34.087 --> 30:36.207
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:36.407 --> 30:38.567
Do you want to have a dance later?

30:38.767 --> 30:41.647
Why would you want to dance
with a backstabber like me?

30:41.787 --> 30:44.327
I don't know. I just do.

30:44.527 --> 30:46.647
- Right for a drink?
- Yeah, yeah, good.

30:49.007 --> 30:50.847
Really?

30:51.047 --> 30:54.007
Your focus is in the wrong place.

30:58.827 --> 31:01.567
Hi.

31:01.767 --> 31:06.407
You! Thank you so much
for organising this for me.

31:07.687 --> 31:09.207
Very naughty.

31:11.827 --> 31:14.087
Are you interested in Jack?

31:15.267 --> 31:17.967
No. Why?

31:20.007 --> 31:22.767
If anything happened
between you and Jack,

31:22.907 --> 31:24.767
you'd tell me, right?

31:24.907 --> 31:26.607
Yeah.

31:27.747 --> 31:30.047
Don't lie to me.

31:30.247 --> 31:34.767
'Cause if you lie to me,
I can't be your friend.

31:34.907 --> 31:37.167
And that would break my heart.

31:40.407 --> 31:42.487
- OK.
- Yeah.

32:02.747 --> 32:03.687
Hey.

32:07.127 --> 32:10.927
Hey, congratulations on the new job.
I'm really proud of you.

32:11.067 --> 32:13.287
Thank you, Dad.

32:13.487 --> 32:16.567
I've been up and down
the career ladder a few times.

32:16.767 --> 32:19.467
It probably wasn't the wisest move

32:19.667 --> 32:21.847
announcing your promotion at a party.

32:22.047 --> 32:23.827
No, that wasn't part of the plan.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.567
Especially at a party where the person

32:25.767 --> 32:27.087
you're deposing is an actual guest.

32:27.227 --> 32:29.887
Yes. Got that.

32:30.087 --> 32:32.767
Come and have a dance
with your old dad, OK?

32:32.967 --> 32:35.127
- Dadda dance?
- Dadda...

32:35.267 --> 32:37.187
Dadda. Come on.

32:37.387 --> 32:39.127
- If you don't do it...
- Oh, no.

32:39.327 --> 32:41.887
- Please don't point the fingers.
- Come on, up. Come on, darl.

32:42.087 --> 32:43.607
- Ooh.
- Ooh, dear.

32:45.847 --> 32:47.887
Have you ever had sex on a plane?

32:48.087 --> 32:50.767
- Yes.
- Actually, it was a bus.

32:50.967 --> 32:53.007
- Down it goes.
- Cheers.

32:53.207 --> 32:54.607
Oh.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.547
"Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we

32:57.727 --> 33:00.487
"For such as we are made of,
such we be."

33:00.687 --> 33:02.767
Is that a quote from 'Twelfth Night'?

33:06.487 --> 33:08.767
- Dad, eat.
- Oh, thank you, darl.

33:08.967 --> 33:11.827
- Lily!
- Oh!

33:12.027 --> 33:13.767
- Hello, Ivan.
- Mmm!

33:13.967 --> 33:17.367
- You excited about the baby?
- Yeah.

33:17.507 --> 33:19.407
You're glowing!

33:19.547 --> 33:21.687
Oh...

33:21.827 --> 33:23.207
Hi, birthday girl.

33:23.407 --> 33:25.367
- Hi.
- Ready for that dance?

33:25.567 --> 33:27.967
Um, I might just keep moving this way.

33:28.167 --> 33:29.567
I've got lots of people to talk to.

33:29.707 --> 33:31.467
I'm a person. Talk to me.

33:31.667 --> 33:33.567
- OK.
- Come on.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.187
It's time for our dance.

33:38.387 --> 33:41.287
So can you feel this?

33:41.427 --> 33:42.827
Sure can.

33:42.947 --> 33:46.927
Can you feel... this?

33:47.127 --> 33:48.647
- Yep.
- Yeah?

33:48.847 --> 33:51.467
- What the hell is she doing?
- She's drunk.

33:54.727 --> 33:57.007
Can't feel anything below the waist.

34:07.287 --> 34:09.907
- Darling. Hon?
- It's alright, it's alright.

34:10.107 --> 34:12.246
Why do you have to be that girl
every single time?

34:12.447 --> 34:14.726
Stop, Lily. Look after your brother,
I'll look after Simone.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.206
- Pete, get some ice.
- It's fine.

34:16.407 --> 34:17.766
It happened before,
it's gonna happen again.

34:17.967 --> 34:21.467
- Let's just get him home, OK?
- It's alright, it's alright.

34:21.667 --> 34:24.827
- No, he's alright, right?
- He's fine, he's gonna be fine.

34:25.027 --> 34:26.887
- He's gonna be fine.
- Watch his head.

34:29.487 --> 34:31.407
Thanks, Lil.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.847
Hey... I like looking after you.

34:35.047 --> 34:36.847
You shouldn't have to
look after your big brother, Lil.

34:37.047 --> 34:39.766
I'm supposed to look after you.

34:39.967 --> 34:42.887
- Seatbelt.
- Yeah.

34:43.087 --> 34:44.996
- You guys alright?
- Good, darl.

34:45.022 --> 34:46.233
- See you.
- Night-night.

34:47.030 --> 34:50.367
- Can this night get any worse?
- Uh...

34:53.187 --> 34:55.127
Obviously. What do you reckon?

34:55.266 --> 34:57.647
Excuse me, everyone.

34:57.847 --> 34:59.367
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. She's back.

34:59.507 --> 35:00.727
Excuse me.

35:01.907 --> 35:04.527
Excuse... me.

35:04.727 --> 35:07.887
I'd like to make a toast
to the lovely Lily.

35:08.027 --> 35:09.367
Ooh.

35:09.567 --> 35:12.887
For those of you who don't know me,
I've been Lily's boss and mentor

35:13.027 --> 35:14.767
for a number of years.

35:16.127 --> 35:18.607
But Lily has been more
than a protege to me.

35:20.007 --> 35:23.247
She's been a friend and a confidante,

35:23.387 --> 35:25.107
as we walked side by side

35:25.307 --> 35:28.727
down the sometimes rocky road
of breakfast TV.

35:31.007 --> 35:34.607
I've always seen Lily as a bud,
a flower about to bloom.

35:36.587 --> 35:38.287
And bloom she has.

35:38.427 --> 35:41.327
Look at her.

35:41.527 --> 35:44.647
But like many blossoms
she bloomed too early.

35:44.847 --> 35:48.247
And what we see now is not
the beauty of her petals opening,

35:48.447 --> 35:51.607
but rather the tragic desperation
of a flower

35:51.807 --> 35:53.527
trying to grow too fast and too soon.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.007
She usually speak like this?

35:55.207 --> 35:56.487
- It's pretty weird.
- I don't know.

35:56.687 --> 35:58.587
And as her mentor, I want to say,

35:58.727 --> 36:01.947
"Lily, grow and bloom.

36:02.087 --> 36:04.767
"Be that flower."

36:06.247 --> 36:08.887
But I can't.

36:09.087 --> 36:12.287
I can't, because if she
is plucked too soon,

36:12.427 --> 36:14.047
she will die.

36:14.247 --> 36:16.927
She'll be trodden on
and squashed into the ground,

36:17.067 --> 36:19.127
never, never to blossom again.

36:19.327 --> 36:21.127
She'll be nothing more than mulch.

36:22.467 --> 36:23.687
To Lily!

36:23.887 --> 36:26.607
- To Lily!
- Lily.

36:26.747 --> 36:28.287
Lily!

36:28.487 --> 36:31.047
It's a pretty weird speaking style.
Strangely effective, I reckon.

36:35.607 --> 36:36.967
Job's yours.

36:38.227 --> 36:39.327
Good luck.

36:40.887 --> 36:43.567
Lil. Lil, Lil.
The police are here to see you.

36:43.767 --> 36:45.367
- Why?
- Something about a noise complaint.

36:45.567 --> 36:47.367
Get them to talk to the people
that own the place.

36:47.567 --> 36:49.647
- They've asked to talk to you.
- Oh, shit!

36:49.847 --> 36:51.487
- Take this.
- OK.

36:53.647 --> 36:55.687
- Hello.
- Are you Miss Lily Woodward?

36:55.887 --> 36:57.367
- Yes.
- There's been a complaint.

36:57.507 --> 36:58.887
What? About me?

36:59.087 --> 37:01.107
The complaint is you're
too damn sexy for your own good.

37:14.882 --> 37:17.082
Lily, hey, you OK?

37:17.222 --> 37:19.082
Yeah.

37:19.282 --> 37:24.362
Thank you for organising all of this,
but I think I'm gonna head home.

37:24.562 --> 37:26.382
I did not organise the stripper,
by the way.

37:26.562 --> 37:28.022
Oh, so does that mean you did organise

37:28.202 --> 37:31.362
Simone sexually assaulting Vincent,
and Sasha's ode to mulch?

37:31.562 --> 37:33.242
No, no, I didn't organise those either,

37:33.382 --> 37:35.202
but they were equally entertaining.

37:36.442 --> 37:38.322
Oh, OK.

37:43.842 --> 37:45.802
If you wait 10 minutes,
I can walk you home.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.942
Oh, no, you stay with Meredith.

37:48.142 --> 37:49.722
Oh, that's alright. She already left.

37:49.862 --> 37:51.322
Oh, I'll be right.

37:51.522 --> 37:53.122
- You sure?
- Yeah.

37:58.582 --> 37:59.962
Hey.

38:01.282 --> 38:02.882
- Hi.
- You're leaving.

38:04.382 --> 38:06.722
- Did Simone get home safely?
- Yeah.

38:08.062 --> 38:10.042
Can I walk you home?

38:10.242 --> 38:12.582
I don't need you to walk me home.

38:12.702 --> 38:15.122
I'll walk you anyway.

38:34.162 --> 38:37.002
- Hey.
- Mm. Hi.

38:39.762 --> 38:42.042
- Want to go to bed?
- Mm-hm.

38:43.282 --> 38:45.882
- How did the party end up?
- Badly.

38:46.082 --> 38:49.002
- Poor Lily.
- Yeah.

38:49.142 --> 38:50.942
Mmm.

38:52.722 --> 38:55.322
I feel like things are
going really well with us.

38:55.522 --> 38:57.722
We've got a healthy baby
on the way and...

38:59.082 --> 39:00.682
you've got a new job.

39:01.962 --> 39:04.302
I don't feel so sick anymore.

39:06.522 --> 39:09.042
I'm happy.

39:29.522 --> 39:31.722
I can't be with you, Jack.

39:31.922 --> 39:34.402
OK. All I'm doing
is walking home with you.

39:34.602 --> 39:38.202
I explained to you,
there is a quarantine period.

39:38.342 --> 39:39.722
Does that include walking?

39:40.942 --> 39:42.602
No.

39:45.082 --> 39:47.042
So was Simone OK?

39:47.182 --> 39:49.722
Yep.

39:49.922 --> 39:53.202
I wanted to come here alone
and see you with no distractions.

39:53.342 --> 39:56.662
Well, here I am, alone.

39:57.802 --> 39:59.302
What do you want to say?

39:59.502 --> 40:02.962
I think I have a problem
when it comes to you.

40:04.762 --> 40:08.322
I never intentionally stabbed Sasha
in the back, OK?

40:08.522 --> 40:11.582
I... I'm not like that.
You need to know that.

40:11.782 --> 40:13.602
Yeah, I do know that. No, it's...

40:13.802 --> 40:16.242
It's not that. It's something else.

40:16.382 --> 40:17.962
What?

40:18.102 --> 40:20.888
I think I like you too much.

40:20.913 --> 40:22.881
Jack, there are...

40:23.522 --> 40:25.762
...so many more reasons
why we shouldn't be together

40:25.787 --> 40:28.042
than why we should.

40:28.182 --> 40:30.362
You're my friend

40:30.562 --> 40:34.082
and I don't want that to cross over
into anything else.

40:35.302 --> 40:38.582
So you don't feel anything for me?

40:50.602 --> 40:54.002
No. No, I don't.

40:55.882 --> 40:57.482
I'm sorry.
