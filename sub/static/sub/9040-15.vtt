WEBVTT

00:02.233 --> 00:03.567
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:03.567 --> 00:04.867
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH YOUR DRINKS.

00:04.867 --> 00:07.467
- OKAY, THANKS.
- OKAY.

00:07.467 --> 00:09.400
- [sighs]

00:10.767 --> 00:12.733
- SO WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

00:12.733 --> 00:14.400
- OH, NOTHING.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.633
GEOFFREY TOOK
MICHAEL'S HAT.

00:15.633 --> 00:17.367
AND GEOFFREY'S
WAS AT SCHOOL,

00:17.367 --> 00:18.733
SO MICHAEL
DIDN'T HAVE A HAT,

00:18.733 --> 00:20.067
BUT HE DIDN'T CARE

00:20.067 --> 00:22.767
'CAUSE HE HATES HATS
ANYWAY, SO...

00:22.767 --> 00:24.700
- HM.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.367
SO GEOFFREY TOOK
MICHAEL'S HAT, HUH?

00:51.367 --> 00:53.300
- YEAH.

01:02.933 --> 01:05.300
THIS BREAD IS GOOD.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.500
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.867
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T

01:08.867 --> 01:10.167
FILL UP ON BREAD, THOUGH.

01:10.167 --> 01:12.300
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
- YEAH.

01:37.633 --> 01:39.233
THE BREAD IS GOOD,
THOUGH, YEAH.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.600
THE BUTTER'S GOOD TOO.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.000
IT'S LIKE HONEY BUTTER
OR SOMETHING.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.533
- YEAH.

01:44.533 --> 01:48.233
- HONEY. HMM.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.367
IT REMINDS ME
OF WHEN ROBERT

01:50.367 --> 01:52.167
ACCIDENTALLY
SWALLOWED THE BEE.

01:52.167 --> 01:53.433
OH, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN HIM.

01:53.433 --> 01:56.667
HE WAS, LIKE,
"OHH, OHH!"

01:56.667 --> 01:58.667
- YEAH.
- IT WAS FUNNY.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.233
- YEAH.

02:00.233 --> 02:03.367
YEAH, I LOVE THAT STORY.

02:18.633 --> 02:23.433
- THE BUTTER
SPREADS GOOD TOO.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.500
- YEAH.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.400
I HATE IT
WHEN IT'S TOO FROZEN,

02:26.400 --> 02:28.300
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE IT
TEARS THE BREAD.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.600
- YEAH, ALTHOUGH YOU
DON'T WANT IT TOO SOFT

02:30.600 --> 02:33.767
'CAUSE THEN--THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN OUT.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.033
- YEAH.

02:35.033 --> 02:37.500
WELL, THIS BUTTER'S PERFECT.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.100
- IT'S, LIKE,
THE PERFECT, UM--

02:40.100 --> 02:42.667
WHAT'S THE WORD?

02:42.667 --> 02:44.467
- TEMPERATURE.

02:44.467 --> 02:46.767
- NO.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.933
DENSITY.
THE PERFECT DENSITY.

02:54.933 --> 02:57.567
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.733
ALTHOUGH, YEAH, TEMPERATURE
WOULD HAVE WORKED.

02:59.733 --> 03:02.867
THIS BUTTER IS THE PERFECT
TEMPERATURE/DENSITY.

03:02.867 --> 03:06.233
- YES.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.367
YES, IT IS.

03:17.467 --> 03:20.600
- WE NEED MORE BREAD.
- YEAH.

03:26.333 --> 03:30.767
- AND NOW, MY FAVORITE PART
OF VALENTINE'S DAY.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.500
- WHAT?

03:32.500 --> 03:35.800
- THE--THE MARCH
OF THE RED, SILK BOXERS.

03:35.800 --> 03:40.733
OOH.
[extended]

03:44.133 --> 03:45.567
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

03:45.567 --> 03:47.567
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
SKIP THE DANCING.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.067
- NO, I--WHAT?
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.400
WE DON'T TALK
TO EACH OTHER ALL NIGHT,

03:50.400 --> 03:52.200
AND NOW YOU JUST
WANT TO HAVE SEX?

03:52.200 --> 03:55.633
- NOT JUST.

03:55.633 --> 03:56.800
HEY, COME ON, WE TALKED.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.433
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

03:58.433 --> 04:03.200
"THIS BUTTER IS THE PERFECT
TEMPERATURE/DENSITY."

04:03.200 --> 04:05.600
- WAS I WRONG?
- [sighs]

04:05.600 --> 04:06.667
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:06.667 --> 04:08.533
WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
TO EACH OTHER.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.267
ALL WE DO IS TALK
ABOUT THE KIDS,

04:10.267 --> 04:14.700
OR TELL STORIES WE'VE HEARD
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

04:14.700 --> 04:15.733
- WHAT STORIES?

04:15.733 --> 04:17.600
- OH, ROBERT SWALLOWING
THAT DAMN BEE.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.900
I'VE HEARD THAT STUPID STORY
A MILLION TIMES,

04:20.900 --> 04:23.167
EVERY TIME YOU SEE HONEY
OR A BEE

04:23.167 --> 04:25.700
OR A PERSON
WITH A PUFFY FACE.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.667
- YEAH, THAT'S A MILLION.
- NO.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.100
OR HOW ABOUT THE TIME
YOUR DAD PUT A POSSUM

04:32.100 --> 04:34.133
IN YOUR TENT
DURING A CAMPING TRIP

04:34.133 --> 04:36.367
AND YOU LITERALLY JUMPED OUT
OF YOUR SKIN?

04:36.367 --> 04:37.900
- WHAT?
IT WAS SCARY.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.433
- YEAH,
THAT'S NOT LITERALLY.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.600
YOU LITERALLY JUMP OUT
OF YOUR SKIN, YOU'RE DEAD.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.800
BODY OUT OF SKIN, DEAD.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.067
- HOW ABOUT YOU?

04:46.067 --> 04:47.567
YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME
ABOUT THE STORY

04:47.567 --> 04:49.967
WHERE YOU WORE PURPLE SHOES
AND YOUR FEET SWEATED

04:49.967 --> 04:51.167
AND THEY TURNED PURPLE.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.800
"IT WAS LIKE
I WAS MAKING WINE."

04:52.800 --> 04:55.533
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.333
- I KNOW! SEE?

04:57.333 --> 04:59.367
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT

04:59.367 --> 05:00.900
AND YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.967
- WELL, WE'RE TALKING NOW.
THIS IS GREAT.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.733
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

05:06.733 --> 05:09.433
- NO, DON'T APOLOGIZE.
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.300
I'M--I'M MAD AT US.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.433
- WELL, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
YELLING AT YOU THEN?

05:17.500 --> 05:19.267
- I MEAN, YOU DON'T THINK
WE'RE IN TROUBLE

05:19.267 --> 05:22.000
IF WE CAN'T COME UP WITH
ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.367
- OH, COME ON.
WE DO OKAY.

05:23.367 --> 05:26.333
- MAYBE IF WE DID
MORE STUFF TOGETHER,

05:26.333 --> 05:27.900
WE COULD COME UP
WITH SOMETHING

05:27.900 --> 05:29.367
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

05:29.367 --> 05:30.567
- OKAY.

05:30.567 --> 05:31.633
- REALLY?

05:31.633 --> 05:32.967
- YEAH.

05:32.967 --> 05:34.467
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, SO--

05:34.467 --> 05:37.600
SO WHAT COULD WE DO,
YOU KNOW, TOGETHER?

05:40.900 --> 05:42.700
- WELL...

05:42.700 --> 05:45.667
YOU KNOW WHAT'S LOVELY?

05:48.167 --> 05:50.800
FALLOO!
- OH, RAY, COME ON.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.433
- COME ON.
WHAT?

05:54.433 --> 05:56.733
HEY.

05:56.733 --> 05:58.933
MAYBE YOU--YOU COULD TALK
DURING SEX.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.067
SEE,
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT--

06:00.067 --> 06:02.367
I'VE ALWAYS
ENCOURAGED THAT.

06:02.367 --> 06:05.167
- LOOK, HOW ABOUT WE GO
TO THE BOTANICAL GARDENS?

06:05.167 --> 06:06.667
HUH?
- [laughs]

06:06.667 --> 06:09.400
OH.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.800
HMM.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.733
PERHAPS.

06:13.733 --> 06:14.900
- COULD BE FUN.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.367
COME ON,
I MEAN, THEY HAVE TRAILS

06:16.367 --> 06:19.133
AND NATURE HIKES AND--

06:19.133 --> 06:20.533
AW, FORGET IT.
IT'S LAME.

06:20.533 --> 06:21.833
- YEAH, I MEAN,
COME ON, PLANTS.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.100
WE GOT PLANTS
IN THE BATHROOM.

06:23.100 --> 06:27.033
WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THEM.

06:27.033 --> 06:30.367
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT ELSE COULD WE DO?

06:30.367 --> 06:34.100
- WE COULD WATCH THE END
OF THE NETS-LAKERS GAME.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.633
KIDDING.
I'M SORRY.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.467
- NO, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.

06:37.467 --> 06:39.933
- I KNOW, I MAKE LITTLE JOKES.
I'M DUMB.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.467
- NO, NO, NO.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.333
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO WATCH SPORTS TOGETHER.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.300
COME ON,
YOU'RE A SPORTSWRITER.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.567
THAT'S A BIG PART
OF YOUR LIFE.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.633
I'M INTERESTED IN YOUR LIFE.

06:48.633 --> 06:51.900
YES, YES, I WILL WATCH
THE BASKETBALL GAME WITH YOU.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.233
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

06:53.233 --> 06:54.700
- REALLY?
- YES.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.867
- REALLY?

06:55.867 --> 06:57.800
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, OKAY.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.067
- OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.267
BASKETBALL IT IS.

07:00.267 --> 07:02.400
OH, THIS IS--
THIS IS GOOD.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.467
- SO WHAT COULD YOU DO
TO TAKE MORE INTEREST IN ME?

07:09.467 --> 07:11.433
- OH.

07:11.433 --> 07:14.133
WELL, I WAS GOING
TO SIT NEXT TO YOU

07:14.133 --> 07:17.367
DURING THE WATCHING
OF THE SPORTS.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.233
- YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

07:19.233 --> 07:21.133
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK

07:21.133 --> 07:23.000
ABOUT THIS BOOK
I JUST READ.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.133
- YOU MEAN
BY ME READING IT?

07:28.533 --> 07:29.867
- YEAH.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.300
YEAH, I WOULD LIKE THAT.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.967
- YEAH.
OH, OH, OH.

07:32.967 --> 07:35.800
WELL, IF I'M READING IT,
THEN WE WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER,

07:35.800 --> 07:37.200
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.100
NUTS!
- NO, COME ON.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.267
- WHAT?
- NO, YEAH, REALLY.

07:40.267 --> 07:42.067
I WANT YOU TO READ THIS.

07:42.067 --> 07:45.200
HUH?
LOOK, HERE IT IS.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.567
- "DEVILWOOD."

07:47.567 --> 07:50.100
HMM. UH-HUH.
DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.333
[dramatic voice]
"DEVILWOOD."

07:53.333 --> 07:55.467
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:02.367 --> 08:04.800
- AND I, UH--I COULDN'T TAKE
MORE OF AN INTEREST IN YOU

08:04.800 --> 08:09.133
JUST BY REINTRODUCING MYSELF
TO YOUR BODY?

08:11.400 --> 08:14.133
- YOU READ THAT BOOK,
I'LL LET YOU TAKE THE FULL TOUR.

08:14.133 --> 08:17.267
- CHAPTER ONE!

08:37.900 --> 08:39.467
- [roars]

08:39.467 --> 08:43.033
[laughs]

08:43.033 --> 08:44.933
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

08:44.933 --> 08:47.000
- WAKE UP.
DAD'S ON HIS WAY.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.433
PUT THE GAME ON.

08:50.433 --> 08:52.367
- COME ON!

08:53.767 --> 08:55.867
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

08:55.867 --> 08:58.600
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.333
IF ONE WAS ASKED
TO READ A BOOK

09:00.333 --> 09:02.100
CALLED "DEVILWOOD,"

09:02.100 --> 09:03.467
ONE WOULD BE CORRECT
IN ASSUMING

09:03.467 --> 09:05.900
THAT THE BOOK
WAS SCARY OR EXCITING

09:05.900 --> 09:07.700
OR HAD SOMETHING
DEVIL-Y IN IT,

09:07.700 --> 09:09.667
WOULDN'T ONE?

09:09.667 --> 09:11.567
- ONE WOULD.

09:11.567 --> 09:14.967
- WELL, THEN,
ONE WOULD BE WRONG.

09:14.967 --> 09:17.067
- WHAT'S GOING ON,
RAYMOND?

09:17.067 --> 09:19.900
- DEBRA WANTS ME TO READ THIS
SO WE HAVE STUFF IN COMMON,

09:19.900 --> 09:21.300
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD,

09:21.300 --> 09:25.633
THIS SUCKER'S
LIKE A HORSE TRANQUILIZER.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.100
HERE, LISTEN TO THIS.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.733
LISTEN TO THIS FIRST LINE.

09:28.733 --> 09:32.333
"IMAGINE A RAIN SO BEAUTIFUL
IT MUST NEVER HAVE EXISTED."

09:32.333 --> 09:33.833
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

09:33.833 --> 09:35.133
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

09:35.133 --> 09:37.400
TELL ME RIGHT NOW,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.333
- [laughs]
I DON'T KNOW.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.000
- YEAH, BECAUSE
IT'S NONSENSE TALK.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.867
YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THIS BOOK.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.300
- YEAH.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.133
LOOKS LIKE LITTLE RAYMIE
CAN'T WATCH THE GAME.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.467
HE'S GOT HOMEWORK.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.333
- THAT'S THE OTHER STINKING,
HORRIBLE THING.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.067
SHE WANTS TO WATCH SPORTS
TOGETHER TOO,

09:55.067 --> 09:56.467
LIKE THE KNICKS TODAY.

09:56.467 --> 09:57.800
- WHY?

09:57.800 --> 10:00.267
- WE WATCHED A GAME TOGETHER
ON VALENTINE'S DAY,

10:00.267 --> 10:01.600
AND APPARENTLY
THAT WENT WELL,

10:01.600 --> 10:04.567
THE BEING TOGETHER
AND TALKING.

10:04.567 --> 10:05.900
- WHAT DID YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT?

10:05.900 --> 10:08.767
- WHO KNOWS?

10:08.767 --> 10:10.400
THAT'S WHY I ASKED
YOU GUYS TO COME OVER.

10:10.400 --> 10:14.433
I NEED YOU TO KIND OF
ABSORB SOME OF HER.

10:17.333 --> 10:21.567
- SO WE'RE LIKE PAWNS
IN YOUR SICK GAME.

10:21.567 --> 10:22.967
- AND IF SHE ASKS,

10:22.967 --> 10:24.133
LET'S JUST SAY
THAT YOU CAME BY

10:24.133 --> 10:25.833
BECAUSE YOU'RE
STILL BUMMED OUT

10:25.833 --> 10:27.167
ABOUT NOT HAVING
A GIRLFRIEND.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.900
- I AM STILL BUMMED OUT
ABOUT THAT.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.533
- PERFECT.

10:31.533 --> 10:32.800
- I'M BACK.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.333
- OKAY, YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.433
YEAH, KEEP THAT LOOK.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.100
- HEY, I GOT SOME JUNK FOOD
FOR THE GAME.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.700
- AH, SWEET.

10:41.700 --> 10:46.467
- YEAH, I DROPPED THE KIDS OFF
AT YOUR MOM'S SO WE--

10:46.467 --> 10:48.300
ROBERT'S HERE?
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.633
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
OUR DO-STUFF-TOGETHER TIME,

10:50.633 --> 10:53.267
BUT I THINK
HE'S STILL DEPRESSED

10:53.267 --> 10:54.833
ABOUT THE NOT HAVING
A GIRLFRIEND,

10:54.833 --> 10:57.567
YOU KNOW, BEING A LOSER.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.567
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, RIGHT?

11:03.567 --> 11:05.800
I CAN'T
JUST KICK HIM OUT.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.733
- OH, WELL, OKAY.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.667
- YEAH.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.800

11:23.667 --> 11:26.600
- OH, GOOD, ANY TIME.

11:28.767 --> 11:30.700
- THE KNICKS ARE COMING BACK
TO LIFE NOW

11:30.700 --> 11:35.633
SCORING SIX UNANSWERED BUCKETS
LATE IN THIS QUARTER.

11:35.633 --> 11:38.600
WARD NOW WITH THE BALL,
BRINGS IT TO MIDCOURT.

11:38.600 --> 11:43.467

WE'RE WATCHING IT, YEAH.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.567

11:51.567 --> 11:53.800
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BOUNCE
SOME IDEAS OFF OF US,

11:53.800 --> 11:57.133
TALK ABOUT IT, HUH?

11:59.033 --> 12:00.933
- HEY.
DAD, WHAT'S UP?

12:00.933 --> 12:05.100
- PASS ME THE CHIPS.
THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.133
- ARE YOU HERE
FOR THE GAME, FRANK?

12:07.133 --> 12:09.033
- NO, THE SPARKLING
CONVERSATION.

12:09.033 --> 12:12.133
- [laughs]

12:12.133 --> 12:14.600
- OKAY, COME ON,
MOVE YOUR ASS!

12:14.600 --> 12:16.167
- HEY, DAD.

12:16.167 --> 12:19.267
- SORRY.
UH, STEP LIVELY.

12:25.233 --> 12:29.533
- COME ON, GET IT.

12:29.533 --> 12:31.200
- WHAT, SHE WAITING
FOR SOMETHING

12:31.200 --> 12:34.600
TO COME OUT OF THE OVEN?

12:34.600 --> 12:35.900
- NO, FRANK.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.500
RAY AND I ARE WATCHING
A BASKETBALL GAME TOGETHER.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.667
- OH.
WHAT'D HE DO?

12:43.233 --> 12:45.433
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WHAT'D HE DO WRONG

12:45.433 --> 12:47.533
THAT YOU'D DO THIS TO HIM?

12:47.533 --> 12:49.000
- STOP IT, DAD.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.200
- YOU KNOW, FRANK,

12:50.200 --> 12:52.133
THE GAME IS ON
AT YOUR HOUSE TOO.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.567
- HEY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME.
RAY INVITED ME.

12:54.567 --> 12:58.700
- THAT--THAT'S
AN OUTRAGEOUS LIE.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.733
- HE INVITE YOU TOO?

13:06.133 --> 13:09.333
- I--UH...

13:12.667 --> 13:15.600
SORRY, RAYMOND.
I TRIED.

13:17.633 --> 13:20.300
- EASY, NOW. EASY.
- I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.467
- OKAY, GOOD.
- I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU!

13:22.467 --> 13:23.900
- I JUST--I JUST--
- YOU JUST WHAT?

13:23.900 --> 13:25.100
WHAT? YOU JUST WHAT?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.467
- WILL YOU LET ME FINISH
MY SENTENCE?

13:26.467 --> 13:29.233
IF YOU LET ME FINISH,
THEN I COULD FINISH IT.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.867
WELL, NOW I'M AT A LOSS
FOR WORDS.

13:30.867 --> 13:34.000
THIS IS ALL SO SUDDEN.

13:34.867 --> 13:36.300
- I CAN'T BELIEVE--

13:36.300 --> 13:39.000
YOU CAN'T EVEN
WATCH SPORTS WITH ME?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.400
SOMETHING YOU LIKE?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.600
YOU GOT TO HAVE THESE TWO
OVER AS BUFFERS?

13:42.600 --> 13:43.967
- LOOK, I DIDN'T THINK
INVITING THEM OVER

13:43.967 --> 13:45.133
WOULD BE SUCH A BIG DEAL.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.233
THEY'RE GOOD COMPANY.

13:46.233 --> 13:48.000
- [chuckles]

13:48.000 --> 13:51.300
EVEN I DON'T BUY THAT.

13:52.633 --> 13:54.633
- HAVE YOU READ
ANY OF THAT BOOK?

13:54.633 --> 13:55.500
- I READ A LOT.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.167
- YEAH?
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

13:57.167 --> 14:00.067
- IT'S--IT'S ABOUT A RAIN
THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL,

14:00.067 --> 14:03.800
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
IT EXISTED.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.100
- THAT'S THE FIRST LINE.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.600
YOU READ ONE LINE!

14:06.600 --> 14:08.400
- AND I WAS GOING
TO READ THE NEXT ONE

14:08.400 --> 14:11.533
WHEN I CAME OUT
OF MY COMA.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.600
- SO THAT'S IT?

14:18.600 --> 14:20.867
YOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO PUT
ANY EFFORT INTO THIS, ARE YOU?

14:20.867 --> 14:22.967
- OH, COME ON, LOOK,
I JUST DON'T THINK

14:22.967 --> 14:24.633
WE NEED TO TURN
OUR LIVES UPSIDE DOWN

14:24.633 --> 14:27.033
JUST SO WE HAVE MORE
TO TALK ABOUT.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.967
- TRYING TO TALK TO ME

14:28.967 --> 14:31.467
IS TURNING YOUR LIFE
UPSIDE DOWN?

14:31.467 --> 14:33.000
- I JUST--I-I--

14:33.000 --> 14:35.133
- STOP TALKING.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.333
- YEAH, RAY,

14:39.333 --> 14:40.833
DON'T EVEN BOTHER
TALKING TO ME.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.633
YOU JUST ENJOY YOUR COMA.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.333
- [sighs]

14:44.333 --> 14:47.467
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE I WILL.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.667
- SEE? THIS IS WHY
I STAY OUT OF RELATIONSHIPS.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.300
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.000
- OH, HI, DEAR.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.900
YOU HERE
TO PICK UP THE KIDS?

15:09.900 --> 15:11.333
- OH, RIGHT, YEAH,
THE KIDS.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.600
YEAH, IN A MINUTE.
YEAH.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.267
- FRANK SAID
THAT YOU AND DEBRA

15:16.267 --> 15:20.467
WERE HAVING SOME SORT OF
A LOUD DISCUSSION.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.233
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MA.

15:22.233 --> 15:24.033
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.400
- YOU HIDING FROM HER?

15:26.400 --> 15:29.333
- YEAH.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.467
- THEN THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.267
- WHAT, ARE YOU HIDING OUT?

15:37.267 --> 15:38.767
- NO, I'M PICKING UP
THE KIDS.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.267
DIDN'T I JUST ASK
FOR THE KIDS?

15:40.267 --> 15:42.200
WHAT THE HELL, MA?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.333
- YEAH, DON'T BOTHER.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.967
- WHAT--
- I'LL GET THEM.

15:44.967 --> 15:47.600
- I SAID I'LL GET THEM.
I'M CAPABLE OF GETTING THEM.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.267
- HI, KIDS.
- I SAID I WOULD PICK THEM UP.

15:49.267 --> 15:50.700
YEAH, HOW ARE YOU DOING,
KIDS?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.567
LISTEN, I WAS SAYING HELLO
TO MY PARENTS, HUH?

15:52.567 --> 15:54.633
A GUY CAN'T GREET
HIS LOVED ONES?

15:54.633 --> 15:56.433
- SO YOU DON'T MIND
SPENDING TIME WITH THEM?

15:56.433 --> 15:58.500
- OH, COME ON.
WILL YOU GIVE ME A BREAK?

15:58.500 --> 16:01.167
I TRIED, HUH?
DIDN'T I TRY?

16:01.167 --> 16:03.167
OH, OKAY, I GET IT.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.567
YOU'RE MAD AT ME
FOR NOT TALKING TO YOU,

16:04.567 --> 16:06.000
SO NOW YOU'RE
NOT TALKING TO ME.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.233
AH, ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?

16:07.233 --> 16:09.033
MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

16:09.033 --> 16:13.633
PUT THAT PIPE
IN YOUR MOUTH, HM?

16:13.633 --> 16:14.600
WHAT?

16:14.600 --> 16:17.733
WHAT, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

17:31.967 --> 17:34.100
- MAY WE HELP YOU?

17:34.100 --> 17:36.000
- NO. WE'RE FINE.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.600
- THERE'S A WEIRD CAT.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.267
IT WAS OUTSIDE.
YEAH, IT'S GONE NOW.

17:40.267 --> 17:44.300
IT WAS--IT HAD A BROWN EYE
AND, LIKE, ONE NO EYE.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.900
YEAH, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.033
IT WAS WEIRD.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.533
- WOW.
- I KNOW.

17:51.533 --> 17:53.967
THAT'S REALLY--
- REALLY KIND OF SWEET.

17:53.967 --> 17:55.233
- SWEET?
WHAT, THAT?

17:55.233 --> 17:56.667
THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.833
- WELL, IT'S LIKE
THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.933
- I DON'T THINK IT'S 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

18:00.933 --> 18:03.967
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T WANT TO.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.267
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:05.267 --> 18:08.267
THEY SEEM SO IN TUNE.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.767
- I SEE COWS.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.667
- HERE'S ONE DOGGIE,
AND HERE'S ANOTHER DOGGIE.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.000
- LOOK AT THAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.433
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:33.433 --> 18:37.167
I NEED YOU TO DRAW
FOUR MORE DOGGIES AND A CHICKEN.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.600
THAT LOOKS GOOD TO YOU?

18:42.600 --> 18:46.900
- THEY--THEY JUST SEEM
SO COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.533
I DON'T KNOW.

18:48.533 --> 18:51.067
MAYBE WE'RE AT THAT POINT
WHERE WE CAN BE COMFORTABLE

18:51.067 --> 18:53.367
JUST BEING WITH EACH OTHER.

18:53.367 --> 18:57.667
- YOU WANT TO BE LIKE THEM?

18:57.667 --> 19:00.967
- NOT EXACTLY.

19:00.967 --> 19:03.700
BUT JUST IMAGINE
HOW MUCH BETTER

19:03.700 --> 19:05.367
OUR VALENTINE'S DINNER
WOULD HAVE BEEN

19:05.367 --> 19:06.733
IF WE WEREN'T SO WORRIED
ABOUT FILLING UP

19:06.733 --> 19:09.667
EVERY SINGLE SECOND
WITH TALK ABOUT BUTTER.

19:09.667 --> 19:12.033
- WELL, YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
WAS BABBLING ABOUT THE BREAD.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.700
IT'S ONLY NATURAL YOU'RE
GONNA GET MY BUTTER THEORY.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.333
- ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.

19:17.333 --> 19:21.333
I KNOW, BUT WHAT IF
WE HAD JUST BEEN HAPPY

19:21.333 --> 19:23.667
TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE,
JUST US,

19:23.667 --> 19:26.633
ENJOYING THE PEACE
AND THE QUIET?

19:26.633 --> 19:28.700
- I DO LIKE QUIET...

19:28.700 --> 19:30.033
- YEAH, ME TOO.

19:30.033 --> 19:32.100
- AND PEACE.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.600
- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS,

19:35.600 --> 19:38.933
FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS,
WHEN IT'S QUIET,

19:38.933 --> 19:42.133
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER,

19:42.133 --> 19:46.033
DO I MIND HAVING YOU
SITTING NEXT TO ME?

19:46.033 --> 19:47.267
NO, I DON'T MIND.

19:47.267 --> 19:50.400
- OH, OKAY.
GOOD.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.067
- YOU MIND SITTING
NEXT TO ME?

19:52.067 --> 19:53.867
- NO.
YOU SMELL GOOD.

19:53.867 --> 19:55.233
- OH.

19:56.767 --> 19:58.900
- 30 YEARS?
WHY DID YOU SAY 30 YEARS?

19:58.900 --> 20:00.267
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--

20:00.267 --> 20:01.433
- WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO DIE AT 70?

20:01.433 --> 20:02.867
- NO.
- 'CAUSE 30 YEARS,

20:02.867 --> 20:05.100
THAT'S A WEIRD NUMBER.
- OKAY, SHH, SHH.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.333
LET'S NOT TALK.
- OKAY.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.900
RIGHT, IT WORKS
FOR THEM.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.767
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

20:10.767 --> 20:15.367
- UGH, I CAN'T LOOK AT HIM
EAT ANYMORE.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.033
- THE CAVALIERS CAME UP
WITH A SURPRISE UPSET,

20:37.033 --> 20:39.200
BEATING THE BLAZERS 108-99.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.233
THE LAKERS HAD NO TROUBLE
WITH THE ROCKETS,

20:41.233 --> 20:43.100
WINNING 124-88.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.233
