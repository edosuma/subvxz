WEBVTT

00:03.774 --> 00:07.111
THEY CALLED ME MAYDAY

00:11.449 --> 00:14.243
- Morning, Norm.
- Morning, Sam.

00:15.661 --> 00:18.456
- Coffee's on.
- Great. Any calls?

00:20.583 --> 00:24.879
- Vera called this morning.
- You guys gonna patch it up?

00:25.046 --> 00:28.549
No. She just wanted to reach out
and nag someone.

00:35.139 --> 00:37.600
Come on. Admit it, Norm. You miss her.

00:38.893 --> 00:41.687
Yeah. Yeah, I do miss her.

00:41.854 --> 00:46.108
There's only one thing that keeps me
from taking her back right now.

00:46.275 --> 00:49.403
- She kicked you out on your butt.
- Right.

00:50.613 --> 00:53.949
- I appreciate you letting me crash here.
- Don't mention it.

00:54.116 --> 00:57.244
When I get back on my feet,
I'll pay you some kind of rent.

00:57.411 --> 01:01.457
- That's not necessary.
- I have my pride to consider.

01:01.624 --> 01:05.878
All right. Pay me a dollar a month.

01:06.962 --> 01:09.006
For what?

01:10.675 --> 01:14.595
- How about 50 cents?
- Fine. No cleaning deposit.

01:16.305 --> 01:18.432
- We're low on cream.
- I'll get on it.

01:18.599 --> 01:20.893
No rush.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

02:44.185 --> 02:46.937
Coach, do you know who that is?

02:49.565 --> 02:51.942
Who, the guy with Dick Cavett?

02:56.488 --> 02:58.616
Coach, that's Dick Cavett.

02:59.742 --> 03:03.579
- Yeah, that is him.
- Yeah. Lecturer, talk show host,

03:03.787 --> 03:06.332
raconteur, short guy.

03:08.834 --> 03:12.671
- Cute for a brainiac.
- I used to watch him on PBS.

03:17.676 --> 03:21.180
- You watch PBS?
- Sure.

03:21.347 --> 03:24.558
- There was one show I used to love.
- Which one?

03:24.725 --> 03:28.228
The one with all the girls
answering the phones.

03:34.443 --> 03:37.321
I wonder what Dick Cavett's
doing in Boston.

03:40.282 --> 03:44.453
- I don't like the look on her face.
- I haven't seen one I do like.

03:46.246 --> 03:50.084
What a shame.
Scooter McGrath died. Heart attack.

03:50.292 --> 03:54.755
- Who was he, Coach?
- Old team-mate of mine. Nice guy.

03:54.922 --> 03:58.509
- Sorry to hear that.
- Scooter had a lot of bad habits.

03:58.676 --> 04:00.886
He probably got out of shape.

04:01.095 --> 04:05.474
It just goes to show
everybody needs exercise.

04:05.641 --> 04:08.185
I could sure use something, Cliffo.

04:08.394 --> 04:12.231
- What do you recommend?
- You could do what I do.

04:12.439 --> 04:15.818
Prehensile isotonic geometrics.

04:15.984 --> 04:19.488
- Prehensile isotonic geometrics.
- What is it?

04:19.697 --> 04:22.658
Muscle tension
under constant contraction.

04:22.825 --> 04:28.330
The beauty of it is you can do it any
time, anywhere, but you don't perspire.

04:28.497 --> 04:30.958
- You wanna give it a shot?
- Sure.

04:31.166 --> 04:34.670
Choose a muscle. When I say "Go",
flex it for 60 seconds.

04:34.837 --> 04:37.589
One, two, three, go.

04:41.844 --> 04:45.681
I saw this on "Twilight Zone" once.

04:46.724 --> 04:49.893
Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing
you're Dick Cavett.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.438
I couldn't help being Dick Cavett.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.900
Ah, wit. My ears hunger for it.

04:58.736 --> 05:01.029
Being an aspiring poetess,

05:01.196 --> 05:07.119
I enjoyed your interviews with
all those wonderfuI writers and poets.

05:07.327 --> 05:11.498
I remember when that Russian poet
decided to defect on your stage.

05:11.665 --> 05:15.085
That was a great moment.
Upset the cleaning crew.

05:16.587 --> 05:19.131
You goose!

05:22.676 --> 05:27.222
- So what brings you to our hostelry?
- If you must know, and I see you must,

05:27.431 --> 05:30.934
I'm doing a book-signing party
at the Copley Plaza.

05:31.143 --> 05:33.854
Yes, your new book. It's wonderfuI.

05:34.021 --> 05:37.691
- Have you read it?
- No, I can only imagine.

05:38.692 --> 05:45.741
You must have a lot of close and dear
friends in the publishing world.

05:45.908 --> 05:47.701
A few.

05:47.910 --> 05:53.832
Wouldn't it be a great thrill for you
to run across a budding poetic genius?

05:54.958 --> 05:57.502
Only if I were wearing cleats.

06:02.758 --> 06:08.472
I welcome your sense of humour
in this desert of banality.

06:09.765 --> 06:14.186
I wouldn't call this a desert. A desert
would be an easier place to get a drink.

06:14.353 --> 06:18.106
Oh, yes. What can I get you?

06:18.315 --> 06:21.902
Time's up, Coach. So, did it work?

06:22.110 --> 06:27.449
I was trying to flex my gall bladder,
but I remembered it's in Providence.

06:29.785 --> 06:32.663
That is the stupidest exercise
I ever saw.

06:32.829 --> 06:34.957
Stupid like a fox.

06:35.123 --> 06:39.294
- How do you keep so trim, Carla?
- Sex.

06:39.461 --> 06:41.755
You mean sex is the greatest exercise?

06:41.922 --> 06:45.175
No. I miss it so much I can't eat.

06:51.723 --> 06:54.643
"We ran together.

06:54.810 --> 06:57.938
"Spring set the pace
through the wild heather's bloom.

06:58.105 --> 07:02.526
"We stopped,
transfixed by a mayfly's flight.

07:02.693 --> 07:06.071
"Is love not such, but easier to capture?

07:06.238 --> 07:10.534
"'A bug,' you said, crushing it.

07:10.701 --> 07:13.870
"I smiled, but just a little. "

07:15.539 --> 07:17.749
What did you think?

07:17.958 --> 07:22.295
Well, it... It could use a little bit of...

07:22.462 --> 07:24.923
What shall I say? It needs a little...

07:25.132 --> 07:28.218
- Ambiguity, tension and paradox?
- Exactly.

07:29.261 --> 07:33.557
I think I've solved that
with "Ephemera II".

07:36.017 --> 07:38.019
"The sky was gossamer... "

07:38.186 --> 07:41.773
Diane, somebody wants you
at another table.

07:41.982 --> 07:46.027
- Who?
- Everybody at this one. Come on.

07:50.282 --> 07:53.702
Sorry about that, Mr Cavett.
She gets overexcited.

07:53.869 --> 07:55.245
That's all right.

07:55.412 --> 07:59.875
I'm Sam Malone, owner of the bar.
You want anything, just call me.

08:00.041 --> 08:03.044
Wait. Sam Malone?

08:03.211 --> 08:07.048
- Used to play baseball?
- That's right. You remember me?

08:07.215 --> 08:09.676
I saw you pitch once at Yankee Stadium.

08:09.843 --> 08:11.970
Is that right? Did I have a good night?

08:12.137 --> 08:15.140
I hope so. You had a lousy day.

08:18.226 --> 08:22.981
You hit three batters and gave up
back-to-back homers. Remember?

08:23.148 --> 08:26.485
I had a drinking problem
back in those days.

08:26.693 --> 08:33.200
There are a few things I don't remember.
Like... 1974, 1975.

08:33.366 --> 08:36.453
- '75. The year you won the pennant.
- We did?

08:36.620 --> 08:39.581
How about that!
Is that right?

08:39.748 --> 08:43.001
- You seem fine now.
- I finally kicked it.

08:43.210 --> 08:46.713
- If you want anything, give a holler.
- OK, Sam.

08:50.759 --> 08:53.803
Say, Sam. I want to thank you
for everything.

08:53.970 --> 08:56.348
Pleasure meeting you.

08:56.556 --> 08:58.600
Say...

08:59.684 --> 09:04.189
Has it ever occurred to you that there
might be public interest in your life story?

09:04.356 --> 09:08.193
Because of my baseball career
and battle against alcohoI

09:08.360 --> 09:10.654
and the irony of owning a bar now?

09:10.862 --> 09:13.156
Never crossed my mind.

09:13.365 --> 09:17.452
How about this? Type up 50 pages,
I'll show it to a publisher.

09:17.619 --> 09:21.915
- Always looking for a good story.
- That's great!

09:22.082 --> 09:26.169
- Why are you doing this for me?
- I like to encourage young writers.

09:26.336 --> 09:30.257
Especially one who has the potentiaI
of being inferior to me.

09:31.549 --> 09:35.762
Thank you very much, Mr Cavett.
Guys, did you hear that?

09:35.929 --> 09:39.849
Mr Cavett's gonna help me
get my life story published.

09:40.016 --> 09:42.769
Diane, did you...

09:46.398 --> 09:50.318
The man was starting to fall
under the thrall of my poetry

09:50.527 --> 09:53.947
when you distracted him
with your miserable life.

09:54.906 --> 09:58.326
Sweetheart, it wasn't anything like that.
It was his idea.

09:58.535 --> 10:01.371
Well, it's still ridiculous.

10:01.538 --> 10:05.125
Sam, the written word
is very speciaI to me.

10:05.291 --> 10:09.295
To you, it's just
a means of finding the men's room.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.801
Come on. I wrote pretty good
in high schooI.

10:14.968 --> 10:20.098
You didn't write "pretty good".
You wrote pretty well.

10:20.265 --> 10:23.101
I wish she'd make up her mind.

10:23.268 --> 10:25.395
Wait a second. I got an idea.

10:27.272 --> 10:31.651
You're a pretty good... well writer.
Why don't you...

10:33.445 --> 10:36.489
Why don't you help me write this thing?

10:36.656 --> 10:38.700
Please?

10:38.867 --> 10:42.954
- You're just feeling sorry for me.
- No, I'm not.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.918
Come here.

10:50.712 --> 10:55.133
Look, I threw away my chance
to be a famous guy once.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.471
Maybe you could help me this time.
Please?

11:02.640 --> 11:05.977
- It would be good experience.
- Yeah.

11:06.186 --> 11:09.939
However, I would insist on
an as-told-to credit.

11:10.106 --> 11:14.235
This will be great. You and I make such
a wonderfuI team in every other way.

11:14.402 --> 11:17.363
Do you want to fooI around or write?

11:17.530 --> 11:20.950
I can do one and you can do the other.

11:21.159 --> 11:23.703
- Let's get started.
- All right.

11:25.914 --> 11:29.959
Moonglow?
Moonglow Peterson, is that you?

11:32.045 --> 11:35.548
- It's me, Wally Bodell.
- Wally Bodell?

11:35.757 --> 11:38.967
- From Dean Acheson High?
- One and the same!

11:39.134 --> 11:42.471
Well, I'll be! I haven't seen you
since high schooI.

11:42.638 --> 11:45.432
You've put on a few pounds, paI.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.435
You lost a few.

11:50.604 --> 11:53.815
Yeah, I work out a little bit.

11:53.982 --> 11:58.111
Right. It is good seeing you, Moonglow.

11:58.278 --> 12:01.532
- Moonglow, huh?
- We wrestled together in high schooI.

12:01.740 --> 12:07.329
And in a state tournament, his opponent
accidentally yanked off Norm's trunks.

12:07.496 --> 12:11.416
Don't laugh. That's how
I first caught Vera's eye.

12:11.583 --> 12:14.670
- Let me get you a beer.
- I got some.

12:14.836 --> 12:19.550
Old Vera. Norm and I competed for Vera
all through high schooI.

12:19.716 --> 12:22.177
Whatever happened to her?

12:22.386 --> 12:24.680
I married her. Married the hell out of her.

12:29.434 --> 12:33.021
Actually, Vera and I
are kind of separated right now.

12:33.188 --> 12:36.483
Yeah? That's too bad.

12:37.818 --> 12:42.072
You wouldn't mind if I dropped by
and said hello to her, would you?

12:42.239 --> 12:47.119
Mind? Hell, no. She's nothing to me now.
Don't worry about it.

12:47.286 --> 12:50.872
He's going out with a girI
better than Vera.

12:51.039 --> 12:53.792
That old hag. You can tell her, too.

12:54.626 --> 12:58.005
- What's her name?
- Tanya.

12:58.171 --> 13:01.758
- Right, Tanya.
- Tanya Cocoabutter.

13:05.512 --> 13:08.557
Sure you don't mind
if I drop by on Vera?

13:08.724 --> 13:11.435
- Sure.
- All right. I gotta go now.

13:11.601 --> 13:14.855
- Nice meeting you, Cliff.
- Take care, Wally.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.318
Don't mention it now.

13:24.156 --> 13:27.451
When are you going
to bring Tanya by here?

13:30.579 --> 13:33.707
Hey, Normie, what's the long face for?

13:33.874 --> 13:37.919
You guys don't know Wally like I do.
He moves fast.

13:38.086 --> 13:41.923
I wonder if Vera will let me kiss the bride
at their wedding.

13:42.090 --> 13:46.344
- I'm sure she will, Normie.
- She didn't at ours.

13:47.429 --> 13:50.140
Course, I didn't try that hard.

14:00.277 --> 14:03.697
- Boy, I feeI terrific.
- Been exercising, Coach?

14:03.863 --> 14:07.367
I just came back
from doing some laps in the pooI.

14:07.534 --> 14:11.121
- How many are you up to?
- Three. Takes an hour.

14:12.247 --> 14:14.624
That's kind of slow, isn't it?

14:14.833 --> 14:18.586
I could run faster
if they got the water out of there.

14:22.632 --> 14:26.553
You know what they say, Coach.
Healthy body, healthy mind.

14:26.761 --> 14:30.140
Pick one you've got a good shot at.

14:30.306 --> 14:33.268
I never felt better.
I feeI 20 years old again.

14:33.435 --> 14:35.562
Good for you, Coach.

14:35.770 --> 14:40.483
I could do handstand push-ups right now
and I haven't done any in years.

14:40.650 --> 14:44.070
- CarefuI. You might hurt something.
- I gotta try it.

14:46.990 --> 14:49.367
Now let me try it one-handed.

14:49.576 --> 14:51.703
I still got the old touch!

14:51.911 --> 14:53.872
What the hell are you doing?

14:54.039 --> 14:58.043
Handstand push-ups.
Like I used to do in spring training.

14:58.209 --> 15:01.629
You never did that.
It was Johnny Driscoll.

15:01.838 --> 15:03.590
Oh, yeah.

15:07.927 --> 15:12.098
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK, thanks to Sam.

15:13.516 --> 15:17.687
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I got a kick out of it.

15:17.854 --> 15:20.899
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

15:21.065 --> 15:23.443
I'll be here. Yeah.

15:25.945 --> 15:28.573
- Who was that?
- Wally Bodell.

15:28.740 --> 15:32.035
- I guess he didn't like my prank.
- What did you do, Norm?

15:32.202 --> 15:34.746
Told the cops he was holding dope.

15:34.954 --> 15:38.541
You'd think he'd never been
strip-searched. What a sorehead.

15:38.708 --> 15:42.962
- How could you do a thing like that?
- He was getting on my nerves.

15:43.129 --> 15:45.924
He's really putting the moves on Vera.

15:46.090 --> 15:48.468
Every time I drive by, his car's there.

15:48.635 --> 15:53.056
- So he's coming down here now?
- To talk things over a little bit.

15:53.223 --> 15:58.436
Good idea. You have a little talk,
you punctuate it with a fist in his face.

15:58.645 --> 16:02.690
She might have a point there.
You've hit bottom now.

16:02.857 --> 16:06.611
It's time to fix the old engine
and get out on that highway.

16:06.819 --> 16:09.489
Don't tell me you wrecked your car too,
Normie.

16:09.656 --> 16:13.826
- No, Coach, it's a metaphor.
- Those are the hardest to get parts for!

16:17.956 --> 16:20.250
Diane, he's here.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.670
- Mr Cavett?
- Richard.

16:23.836 --> 16:27.966
- Oh, yeah. Hi.
- Thanks for coming on down.

16:28.132 --> 16:31.636
I'm late for a meeting
so I can't stay very long.

16:31.803 --> 16:35.223
I thought you'd be anxious
to hear the verdict.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.016
Guilty.

16:38.685 --> 16:41.563
- Sorry.
- We're both a little bit nervous.

16:41.729 --> 16:46.859
- What did you think?
- I thought the writing was competent.

16:47.068 --> 16:51.698
A little undisciplined in places
but it has a certain energy to it.

16:54.117 --> 16:55.868
Thank you.

16:56.035 --> 17:01.833
I take it you're Sam's co-author?
Miss Jessica Simpson-Bourget?

17:04.919 --> 17:09.048
Diane Chambers. I was only hiding
behind that nom de plume

17:09.214 --> 17:11.509
untiI I made sure that you liked it.

17:11.675 --> 17:13.803
I did just find that out, didn't I?

17:13.970 --> 17:16.806
How can I put this, Jessica?

17:18.057 --> 17:20.727
- You don't like it?
- Well, I liked it...

17:20.893 --> 17:23.438
It shows a great deaI of promise.

17:23.646 --> 17:26.773
But you're not going
to give it to your publisher.

17:26.941 --> 17:30.069
- I'm afraid not.
- How come?

17:30.236 --> 17:33.823
I sounded him out about it
but he feels it's a little tame.

17:34.032 --> 17:38.494
- Not controversiaI enough.
- What about the booze problem?

17:38.661 --> 17:41.497
I guess booze isn't enough these days.

17:41.664 --> 17:47.420
Nowadays, they want something spicier.
Drugs, homosexuality, perversion.

17:49.088 --> 17:52.091
Sorry I didn't get out more.

17:52.258 --> 17:57.221
There is an inference that you were
a bit of a playboy during your career.

17:57.430 --> 18:00.767
Playboy? Hell, yes, I... Well, kind of.

18:02.060 --> 18:08.149
You seem to shy away from that in here.
The cold fact is, sex sells.

18:08.357 --> 18:11.486
My publisher wouldn't be interested
but plenty would.

18:11.652 --> 18:16.449
It might be worth the chance.
I'll say goodbye now and run along.

18:16.657 --> 18:21.954
OK. Well, thank you anyway
for coming down here, Mr Cavett.

18:22.121 --> 18:24.248
- Sure.
- Ta-ta, Richard.

18:24.457 --> 18:27.960
What do you say
we get started here, huh?

18:29.504 --> 18:33.758
- Started on what?
- On what Mr Cavett was talking about.

18:33.925 --> 18:35.760
Spicing this thing up.

18:35.927 --> 18:43.559
I won't have my first published
manuscript be a memoir full of luridities.

18:43.893 --> 18:46.604
I think what he was talking about was...

18:46.771 --> 18:49.524
I know what he was talking about.

18:51.567 --> 18:56.447
Come on. If we get published,
this could mean a whole new life for me.

18:56.614 --> 18:58.658
For you, too.

18:59.700 --> 19:04.247
Well... No, I would never
prostitute my talents that way.

19:05.832 --> 19:09.085
Would Jessica Simpson-Bourget?

19:09.293 --> 19:15.800
That little smut peddler?
In a minute.

19:15.967 --> 19:19.178
- I got some paper in the office.
- OK.

19:19.345 --> 19:22.181
If they want steam, I'll give them steam.

19:22.348 --> 19:25.685
I'm going to use every weapon
in my literary arsenaI

19:25.851 --> 19:30.648
to make their tongues hang out
in unbridled desire.

19:30.856 --> 19:34.944
- Coach, we don't want to be bothered.
- Who does?

19:41.075 --> 19:44.996
Norm. He's here.

19:45.204 --> 19:49.417
Here comes Black Bart and this town
ain't big enough for both of ya.

19:50.459 --> 19:52.920
Of course, what town is?

19:58.509 --> 20:01.929
You wanted to see me, Moonglow?

20:02.096 --> 20:04.390
Go get him, Norm.

20:04.599 --> 20:07.560
Yeah, I wanted to just talk.

20:07.727 --> 20:10.187
Talk's cheap. Throw some hands.

20:11.564 --> 20:15.735
- Leave his woman alone.
- You don't like me seeing Vera?

20:15.901 --> 20:17.737
No!

20:19.697 --> 20:22.158
I'm not reaI wild about it, frankly.

20:22.366 --> 20:24.910
There's something you ought to know.

20:25.995 --> 20:29.206
- I like Vera a lot.
- Yeah?

20:29.373 --> 20:32.960
How did you like the state trooper
with the icy hands?

20:36.672 --> 20:38.716
It had its moments.

20:42.470 --> 20:45.848
You're as big a dink
as you were in high schooI.

20:46.015 --> 20:48.142
- RemodeI his face.
- Positions!

20:48.351 --> 20:50.811
You're in trouble, Bodell.

20:51.020 --> 20:53.481
Come on, you guys.

20:53.689 --> 20:56.734
- Hit him!
- Take this outside, will you?

20:56.901 --> 20:59.653
Back off, Coach.
I'm fighting for my woman.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.781
The winner gets Vera.

21:07.703 --> 21:09.747
Get up, Norm!

21:26.722 --> 21:29.350
It's not exactly Frazier-Ali, is it?

21:32.603 --> 21:35.231
Give?

21:35.397 --> 21:37.149
No. You?

21:40.069 --> 21:42.154
Coach, a glass of water, please.

21:49.328 --> 21:51.705
Boy, can I write.

22:12.601 --> 22:15.855
One, two, three! It's over!

22:24.280 --> 22:27.449
- I did it.
- Way to go, Normie.

22:27.616 --> 22:30.786
Take what's left of your self-respect
and clear out.

22:34.248 --> 22:36.917
All right, Moonglow.

22:37.084 --> 22:40.754
You beat me just like
you used to in high schooI.

22:45.384 --> 22:47.845
We're still friends?

22:48.053 --> 22:52.182
Don't let a seven-and-a-half hour hug
give you the wrong idea.

22:53.851 --> 22:57.771
- Congratulations, Norm. You won Vera.
- Who?

22:58.939 --> 23:01.567
Oh, that's what we were fighting for.

23:01.734 --> 23:06.864
- I'll have to tell her when I see her.
- Go to that phone and call Vera.

23:10.826 --> 23:14.872
Guess I should.
Rather have a trophy, but...

23:24.048 --> 23:26.800
Boy, does she write good.

24:02.544 --> 24:03.545
English

24:04.305 --> 24:10.357
