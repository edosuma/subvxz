44:36.874 --> 44:40.105
- Yeah, but like a duel.

44:40.878 --> 44:41.868
- Jesus Christ!

45:13.244 --> 45:14.678
- Do you remember
that German guy

45:27.792 --> 45:29.908
who found someone online to
come to his house and eat him?

45:30.127 --> 45:30.878
- Yeah.

45:47.545 --> 45:49.218
- This isn't as mad as that.

46:16.974 --> 46:17.611
- Don't tell me, Vernon,

46:23.247 --> 46:24.726
- Course not!

46:54.512 --> 46:56.423
This is crypt layering,

47:38.889 --> 47:41.449
deep web like what
pedophiles use.

47:39.990 --> 47:42.106
- Alright.

47:47.832 --> 47:50.187
Pitch is over.

48:31.308 --> 48:33.538
- Double your money, Harry.

49:03.140 --> 49:05.017
- Jesus, are those
your winnings?

49:25.696 --> 49:27.130
- NO-

49:47.451 --> 49:50.967
No, this is my stake.

49:54.825 --> 49:58.216
- Did you expect to
come here and, what,

49:57.328 --> 49:59.797
we'd kill each other?

50:01.198 --> 50:02.472
- NO-

50:23.821 --> 50:27.291
Only one of us
would have to die.

50:31.662 --> 50:33.414
- Get out.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.473
Trading is gonna be massive.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.438
You can keep
the rest of those beers.

51:50.074 --> 51:51.189
- <i>[V/O] Vernon was</i> a <i>guy
I used to call</i>

51:57.982 --> 51:59.939
<i>for tech support at work.</i>

52:27.311 --> 52:30.622
<i>Now he was suggesting
we kill each other for cash.</i>

52:29.947 --> 52:31.824
<i>It was fucking nuts.</i>

52:38.355 --> 52:42.064
<i>But then again,
if he was serious,</i>

52:58.575 --> 53:01.693
<i>someone was gonna get
that bag of money easily.</i>

53:07.518 --> 53:09.395
- <i>If you emptied
your bank accounts</i>

53:36.847 --> 53:38.884
<i>and sold everything you own,</i>

54:00.804 --> 54:04.035
<i>how much would your life
be worth in hard cash?</i>

54:06.543 --> 54:08.534
<i>If you become a Trader,</i>

54:22.793 --> 54:26.070
<i>you're seven trades
away from a million.</i>

54:40.577 --> 54:42.693
[snaps fingers]
- Give me those.

54:42.813 --> 54:44.770
Get a move on, pal.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.434
You'll never get home
at this rate.

54:54.191 --> 54:56.501
Where are you?

55:05.636 --> 55:08.674
I don't have
the new safe code.

55:31.495 --> 55:32.644
So what do I do
with the money?

55:48.478 --> 55:50.833
Just leave it here
in the office?

56:06.096 --> 56:08.007
I don't know why you have to
keep changing it all the time.

56:12.836 --> 56:14.793
1142?

56:14.438 --> 56:16.554
<i>JU'</i>

56:30.387 --> 56:33.937
Outta here for the weekend.
See you Monday, dickheads.

56:40.063 --> 56:41.656
<i>Like a greater power saying,</i>

56:57.814 --> 56:59.725
<i>"Here's four thousand eight
hundred and twenty-three quid</i>

57:08.892 --> 57:11.645

57:19.336 --> 57:21.976
<i>Now what are you
gonna do with it?"</i>

57:47.030 --> 57:51.183
- <i>Find someone on the website

58:18.061 --> 58:21.213
<i>You're seven trades

58:20.297 --> 58:21.571
- Hello?

58:22.566 --> 58:24.045
- <i>It's Harry.</i>

59:05.842 --> 59:08.960
- Oh, hi, Harry.

59:11.114 --> 59:13.424
- I might be interested.

59:16.386 --> 59:18.616
<i>- It has to be Saturday.</i>

59:29.099 --> 59:30.214
- But that's tomorrow.

59:53.757 --> 59:54.827
- I know.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:12.167
- <i>Oh, okay.</i>

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:29.329
<i>No-no, yeah-yeah,
look um,</i>

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:38.540
I'll PM you a location.

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:40.651
- Fine.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.949
- <i>Put the cash
into the green sports bag.</i>

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:26.264
<i>9.8% of all sports bags
are green,</i>

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:42.434
<i>so the bag will act
as an identifier</i>

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:52.252
<i>Arrange to meet in a
quiet pub during the day.</i>

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:52.765
- What can I get you?

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.524
- Eh, a sparking
mineral water, please.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:13.582
- <i>And make
sure you're happy</i>

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:48.207
<i>with the bona fides
of your fellow Trader.</i>

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:19.417
- <i>[V/O] Vernon had described
Trading as</i> a <i>noble duel,</i>

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:30.227
<i>even though every trade
started in a stinking toilet.</i>

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.814
- Where's your green bag?

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:38.251
- Oh, forget the bag.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.821
I've got the money,

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.211
that's why we're here,
isn't it?

01:03:59.736 --> 01:04:03.047
- Did you write a suicide note?

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.309
- Is that really necessary?

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.880
- Yes.

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:32.666
If they think you've
committed suicide.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.472
Write one now.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.189
Go on.

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:22.903
Good.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:01.806
We don't want people looking
for the loser, do we?

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.574
- Checking for guns.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.044
- I don't have a gun, Vernon.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.137
- Give me your phone.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.551
- Why?

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:46.113
- Why?

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.167
GPS tracking, Harry,
that's why.

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:05.463
And switch it off.

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:18.042
- Travel together
to an isolated location,

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.802
making sure to avoid any
unnecessary attention.

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:31.706
- Pick a number.

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:43.951
We cross the road and
double back to that bus stop,

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:54.290
the first bus that comes we go
for eight stops, then change.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:08:00.707
[police siren wailing]

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:12.251
- <i>[V/O] Vernon was really
proud of his rules.</i>

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.799
<i>he wanted to show me
how to Trade properly.</i>

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:21.220
- This is good, isn't it?

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:26.728
- This isn't really gonna work.

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:32.720
- Well, we could go
somewhere else,

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:42.185
somewhere easier to dig?

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.707
- Look, I do need the money,
but...

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:54.733
this is murder, Vernon.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.646
- Harry, we can't go this far-

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.089
- I can do anything I want,

01:10:34.197 --> 01:10:37.588
and I've decided I
don't want to do this.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.511
Ah!

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.268
Fucking hell, Vernon!

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:07.012
I told you I don't
want to do this.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.195
- It's too late...
you've agreed to trade.

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:41.550
Knives are allowed.

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:44.811
It's in the rules.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:47.884
[grunting]

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.246
Ah!

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:52.277
- You little fucker.

01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:00.975
I told you
I've changed my mind.

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:02.902
- Ah...

01:12:03.186 --> 01:12:05.257
[panting]

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:14.540
It wasn't supposed
to go like this!

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:44.715
- Ah, my shoulder!

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.722
My shoulder!

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:19.797
No, no. No, no, no, no, no,
please don't kill me!

01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:37.666
Don't kill me!
Take the money.

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:09.448
You win.

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.019
[panting]

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:22.298
Ah!

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.243
[wincing in pain]

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.691

- I really couldn't tell you.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:13.985
- ...as <i>with any field injury,
quick action is the key.</i>

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:21.709
<i>You're gonna need a cool head,</i>

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:48.658
<i>and a pair of nitrile
or non-latex gloves.</i>

<i>improvise by using
a plastic bag.</i>

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:14.476
<i>Remember,
the dirtier the wound</i>

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:21.021
<i>the greater the chance
of infection.</i>

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:27.088
<i>If the victim is suffering
from shock...</i>

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.913
- Are you in shock?

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.354
- I think so.

01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:42.787
- <i>If possible, elevate their
feet to improve blood flow.</i>

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.166
<i>Shock can impair blood flow</i>

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:17.873
<i>and lead to brain
or organ damage.</i>

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.737
<i>Talk quietly
and gently to the patient.</i>

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:58.341
<i>Turn their head to the side

<i>Do not remove the knife

- Too late.

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.701
- <i>Now, the first thing to do
is stop the bleeding.</i>

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:44.956
<i>So apply pressure
with a sterile bandage,</i>

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:50.660
<i>that's your best option.</i>

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.216
<i>But if it's bleeding bad,</i>

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.790
<i>and the emergency services
aren't on their way,</i>

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.594
<i>you do have other options.</i>

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.652
- Is that glue, Harry?

01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:11.383
Is this gonna hurt?

01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:47.910
