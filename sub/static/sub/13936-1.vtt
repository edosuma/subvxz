18:23.000 --> 18:24.709
l don't really know why, sir.

18:24.793 --> 18:27.462
Perhaps because no one
in intelligence does.

18:27.546 --> 18:31.257
l just want to be sure
our airborne carpet consists of live troops,

18:31.342 --> 18:32.717
not dead ones.

18:33.510 --> 18:36.638
l know everybody thinks
l'm overanxious, sir,

18:37.181 --> 18:38.431
but l would like to order another

18:38.515 --> 18:40.391
low-level reconnaissance of the area.

18:40.476 --> 18:43.269
(STAMMERlNG)
lf that's all right with you, sir.

18:45.230 --> 18:46.481
Very well.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.275
-All right, Wilson.
-Sir.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.443
Very well.

18:50.861 --> 18:53.529
-Oh, Fuller. Fuller.
-Yeah. Sir?

18:54.031 --> 18:57.325
l wouldn't be too concerned about
what people think of you.

18:57.910 --> 19:00.787
You happen to be somewhat
brighter than most of us.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.414
Tends to make us nervous.

19:14.969 --> 19:18.346
Naturally we'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements, sir,

19:18.430 --> 19:20.348
but please keep in mind

19:20.432 --> 19:23.393
the one factor which is
crippling all our plans.

19:23.769 --> 19:25.687
lt may seem improbable to you,

19:25.771 --> 19:28.898
but we are desperately short
of transport aircraft.

19:29.024 --> 19:30.233
l am aware of that.

19:30.317 --> 19:32.318
ln fact, l'm surprised
that nobody mentioned it to Monty

19:32.403 --> 19:34.529
when he dreamed up this operation.

19:34.905 --> 19:37.865
l need drop zones
as close as possible to the bridge.

19:37.992 --> 19:39.993
Now clearly this area's no use at all.

19:40.077 --> 19:42.954
Can't have my chaps
landing on the top of chimneys, but. . .

19:43.038 --> 19:44.914
Now this looks inviting here.

19:45.082 --> 19:47.500
-ROY: What's the terrain like?
-Sorry, sir.

19:47.584 --> 19:51.379
All our reports indicate that this
terrain here is too soft for glider landings.

19:51.463 --> 19:53.172
You see the nose digs in
first on touchdown,

19:53.257 --> 19:54.507
the whole thing goes ass over tip.

19:54.591 --> 19:55.967
Total write-off.

19:56.552 --> 19:57.635
All right.

19:58.303 --> 20:00.471
-What about there?
-No. l'm afraid not, sir.

20:00.556 --> 20:03.599
You see, after the drop,
when we bank for our return,

20:03.726 --> 20:06.686
we run into a whole lot
of flak and rubbish from this Jerry air field

20:06.770 --> 20:08.354
up here at Deelen.

20:08.605 --> 20:11.566
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere.

20:13.110 --> 20:14.861
Oh, yes, hopefully, sir,

20:15.112 --> 20:16.696
but, as l was saying,

20:17.239 --> 20:19.866
we cannot afford to lose a single aircraft.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.451
That is the problem.

20:21.827 --> 20:25.038
My problem is
l don't just need drop zones.

20:25.622 --> 20:28.124
l need drop zones l can hold and defend.

20:28.876 --> 20:31.711
The rest of my division
arrives with the second drop

20:31.795 --> 20:34.213
and General Sosabowski's
Polish brigade with the third.

20:34.298 --> 20:35.590
l understand, sir.

20:35.674 --> 20:38.051
But we really think
we found the right place.

20:38.135 --> 20:41.220
lt's large enough
for your needs, it's flat and firm,

20:41.638 --> 20:43.347
and also easily defended.

20:43.766 --> 20:44.807
Well, where the hell is it?

20:44.892 --> 20:47.685
Well, it's not actually
on this photograph, but,

20:48.020 --> 20:50.021
it should be. . . Excuse me, sir.

20:50.230 --> 20:53.399
lt would be, about here, l think.

20:56.153 --> 20:58.279
That could be 1 0 miles from the bridge.

20:58.363 --> 20:59.781
No, just under eight, actually, sir.

20:59.865 --> 21:02.116
lf you'd like to have a look at this.

21:04.244 --> 21:07.497
You see, the terrain is easy to traverse.

21:07.998 --> 21:11.334
All our information substantiates that. . .

21:12.628 --> 21:13.711
Yes, sir?

21:15.005 --> 21:17.840
Just making sure whose side you're on.

22:08.475 --> 22:11.644
Now a drop zone eight miles
from Arnhem Bridge

22:11.854 --> 22:14.147
might be thought by some
to present problems.

22:14.231 --> 22:15.940
(WHlSPERlNG) My God. He can't mean it.

22:16.275 --> 22:19.360
l'm afraid he does.
He must know what he's doing.

22:19.528 --> 22:21.237
That's more than l know.

22:21.446 --> 22:23.322
Why should he have
the corner of the market?

22:23.407 --> 22:25.491
. . .cannot under
any stretch of the imagination

22:25.576 --> 22:27.577
be considered ideal,

22:28.120 --> 22:31.497
but the gliders will be bringing in
a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps

22:31.582 --> 22:34.292
specially fitted with
twin Vickers machine guns.

22:34.877 --> 22:36.377
Now the instant we land,

22:36.461 --> 22:39.213
they will race ahead
to the bridge and hold it

22:39.965 --> 22:42.466
until the other battalions arrive on foot.

22:42.593 --> 22:45.178
And they'll be quick enough to secure
both ends of Arnhem Bridge?

22:45.262 --> 22:46.262
Most certainly.

22:46.346 --> 22:48.931
Good, good.
Now if you all know where l shall be.

22:49.016 --> 22:51.392
My headquarters will be
in the center with 82nd.

22:51.476 --> 22:54.103
Now just you remember
that we're all totally interlocked.

22:54.188 --> 22:56.397
This is a bottom to top operation.

22:56.815 --> 22:59.734
1 01 st pass XXX Corps on to 82nd.

22:59.818 --> 23:02.153
82nd pass them on to British Airborne.

23:03.155 --> 23:06.199
lf any one group fails,
it's total failure for us all.

23:08.493 --> 23:09.785
All we need now

23:10.454 --> 23:12.246
are three days of clear skies.

23:12.331 --> 23:14.373
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.085
Only the weather can stop us now.

23:18.837 --> 23:19.962
Weather!

23:20.172 --> 23:21.172
(EXCLAlMlNG lN POLlSH)

23:24.593 --> 23:27.261
General Browning, what of the Germans?

23:27.846 --> 23:30.765
Don't you think that since we know that
Arnhem is so crucial to their safety,

23:30.849 --> 23:32.308
they might know that, too?

23:32.392 --> 23:33.684
BROWNlNG: Now, look here.

23:33.810 --> 23:38.522
The few troops
in the area are second class.

23:38.649 --> 23:40.775
They're not frontline caliber,

23:40.859 --> 23:41.984
not at all.

23:42.319 --> 23:43.736
Do you understand?

23:44.112 --> 23:45.738
l think you ought to
have a little more faith

23:45.822 --> 23:47.531
in Montgomery's
intelligence reports, you know.

23:47.616 --> 23:50.076
He's done pretty well
for us in last three or four years.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.495
l will tell you the extent of my faith.

23:54.039 --> 23:56.040
l am thinking of asking
for a letter from you

23:56.124 --> 23:58.918
stating that l was forced
to act under your orders

23:59.002 --> 24:00.920
in case my men are massacred.

24:02.965 --> 24:04.131
l see.

24:06.301 --> 24:08.261
Yes, l do see.

24:12.641 --> 24:14.350
Do you wish such a letter?

24:15.936 --> 24:16.978
No.

24:18.563 --> 24:19.981
No, of course not.

24:20.524 --> 24:22.191
ln the case of massacre,

24:22.859 --> 24:24.777
what difference would it make?

24:35.372 --> 24:37.957
-You mean you don't believe me, sir?
-STEELE: Well, clearly not.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.584
All right, boys.

Sorry about that, sir.

24:45.549 --> 24:46.799
But what, then?

24:46.883 --> 24:49.302
l just don't believe
these damn radios are strong enough

24:49.386 --> 24:52.179
to carry the eight miles
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

24:52.264 --> 24:54.307

any cigarettes, do you, sir?

24:54.391 --> 24:56.434
-No.
-They're perfectly okay.

24:56.727 --> 24:58.728
l've used them
God knows how many times.

24:58.812 --> 25:01.272
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.

25:01.356 --> 25:04.525
Well, l didn't have
any problems with them in the desert.

25:04.818 --> 25:05.943
Yes, l know.

25:06.236 --> 25:08.487
You see, Cole, what bothers me,

25:08.572 --> 25:11.073
what genuinely and truly
has me more than a bit disturbed,

25:11.158 --> 25:12.992
is that Holland being half under water,

25:13.076 --> 25:16.245
is somewhat soggier
than most deserts you're apt to find.

25:17.581 --> 25:19.582
Tends to have a lot more trees.

25:19.833 --> 25:22.710
-Any biscuits?
-Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

25:24.296 --> 25:26.839
Shouldn't you tell the General if you're
so certain about it, sir?

25:26.923 --> 25:28.924
lf l were, believe me, l would.

25:29.426 --> 25:31.177
What if they really don't work?

25:31.261 --> 25:32.803
Well, what difference will it make?

25:32.888 --> 25:35.431
The General will be
on the bridge himself by nightfall.

25:35.515 --> 25:37.224
He won't have to make contact
with the bridge

25:37.309 --> 25:38.351
if he's on it.

25:38.435 --> 25:39.643
Will he, sir?

Well,

it's not gonna be me.

26:53.844 --> 26:55.719

26:58.306 --> 27:00.766
But, sir, you see that they are tanks.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.853
l doubt if they're fully serviceable.

27:04.438 --> 27:06.313
-Still got guns.
-So have we.

27:07.732 --> 27:11.527
Sir, if they weren't serviceable,

27:13.113 --> 27:14.947
why would they try to conceal them?

27:15.031 --> 27:16.824
Normal routine, Fuller.

27:17.701 --> 27:19.994
But, sir, we keep getting reports
from the Dutch underground.

27:20.078 --> 27:21.370
l've read them

27:21.746 --> 27:23.956
and so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

27:24.541 --> 27:25.791
Now look here,

27:26.751 --> 27:29.962
there have been thousands of photographs
from this sortie and from all the others.

27:30.046 --> 27:32.173
How many of them have shown tanks?

27:32.966 --> 27:34.049
Just these, sir.

27:34.134 --> 27:36.302
And you seriously consider
asking us to cancel

27:36.386 --> 27:38.804

in the unlikely event
that the Germans ever get you,

What l'm trying to say, General,

1:30:35.495 --> 1:30:37.913
is, l mean, even if we move
your troops the 50 miles,

1:30:37.997 --> 1:30:40.582
where, l grant you,
just now the sun is shining,

1:30:40.667 --> 1:30:42.709
the chances are that
by the time we get there,

1:30:42.794 --> 1:30:45.504
the fog could quite easily
have preceded us.

1:30:46.673 --> 1:30:48.257

Did the rest of the division arrive safely?

Yes, sir, but we've run into
all kinds of trouble.

1:51:36.922 --> 1:51:40.174
lt would seem that we've landed on top of
two SS Panzer divisions.

down here towards the river

cut them off completely.

the entire division is here,

1:52:00.028 --> 1:52:01.362

break through to him.

more of a chance.

Yesterday's airlift was three hours late
due to fog in England.

1:52:11.957 --> 1:52:14.583
And the gliders bringing
the Poles' equipment didn't arrive at all.

2:00:28.828 --> 2:00:30.787
Was there anything else?

2:00:39.547 --> 2:00:40.756
All right.

2:01:03.321 --> 2:01:04.362
(lN GERMAN)

2:01:04.447 --> 2:01:05.822
And now?

2:01:06.824 --> 2:01:09.743
Flatten Arnhem.

2:01:33.643 --> 2:01:35.352
(SPEAKlNG DUTCH)

2:01:47.365 --> 2:01:51.326
(CHATTERlNG lN DUTCH)

2:01:52.745 --> 2:01:53.870
BOY: Papa!

2:02:52.930 --> 2:02:55.599
-Any movement at Nijmegen?
-None.

2:02:55.683 --> 2:02:57.267
No way of blasting through to the bridge?

2:02:57.351 --> 2:02:58.768
l'd lose all my men for nothing.

2:02:58.853 --> 2:03:01.104
There's God knows how many
lying out there already.

2:03:01.189 --> 2:03:02.689
You mean it's over, sir?

2:03:02.773 --> 2:03:04.524
l didn't say that, did l?

2:03:04.984 --> 2:03:07.027
We've paid for that bridge
and we're going to collect,

2:03:07.111 --> 2:03:09.237
but to do it, l need tank support.

2:03:10.406 --> 2:03:11.907
Well, you've got it, Jimmy.

2:03:11.991 --> 2:03:14.618
The Grenadier Guards
will be happy to oblige.

2:03:14.952 --> 2:03:17.370
-ls that all right, Alex?
-Absolutely, sir.

2:03:17.455 --> 2:03:19.915
lt's not just tanks. l need boats.

2:03:19.999 --> 2:03:21.917
lf XXX Corps were American,
we would have boats.

2:03:22.001 --> 2:03:23.627
-Did you bring any?
-Mike?

2:03:23.711 --> 2:03:26.254
l think we might have
a few about somewhere, sir, yes.

2:03:26.339 --> 2:03:28.048
Well, can you get them here by tonight?

2:03:28.132 --> 2:03:29.549
Well, it won't be easy, sir.

2:03:29.634 --> 2:03:32.135
We've got one road,
1 0-mile traffic jams on it

2:03:32.220 --> 2:03:34.137
and Germans throwing shells at us.

2:03:34.222 --> 2:03:35.889
l don't know quite what we can do but. . .

2:03:35.973 --> 2:03:38.350
Except try! You can do that, can't you?

2:03:39.352 --> 2:03:41.394
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

2:03:41.562 --> 2:03:43.688
Now, look here. About these boats.

2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:47.150
What is your opinion, l mean, how many. . .

2:03:47.693 --> 2:03:49.611
The general's a bit scratchy today, sir.

2:03:49.695 --> 2:03:51.404
But it's nothing personal.

2:03:51.489 --> 2:03:53.240
When we dropped on Sunday,

2:03:53.824 --> 2:03:55.700
l think he cracked his spine.

2:04:05.670 --> 2:04:08.922
-How many boats have we got then?
-About six in each truck.

2:04:23.354 --> 2:04:25.188
GAVlN: Where's Major Cook, soldier?

2:04:25.940 --> 2:04:27.440
l think over there, sir.

2:04:27.525 --> 2:04:28.692
Thank you.

2:04:38.869 --> 2:04:40.412
SOLDlER: Better believe it.

2:04:44.208 --> 2:04:46.209
Julian, where the hell are you?

2:04:47.169 --> 2:04:48.378
Here, sir.

2:04:53.926 --> 2:04:56.386
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.

2:04:56.470 --> 2:04:58.680
What's the best way to take a bridge?

2:04:58.764 --> 2:05:00.181
Both ends at once.

2:05:00.599 --> 2:05:03.476
l'm sending two companies
across the river by boat.

2:05:03.894 --> 2:05:06.688
l need a man with very
special qualities to lead.

2:05:08.441 --> 2:05:09.649
Go on, sir.

2:05:09.734 --> 2:05:11.568
He's got to be tough enough to do it.

2:05:11.652 --> 2:05:13.987
And he's got to be
experienced enough to do it.

2:05:14.071 --> 2:05:15.697
Plus, one more thing.

2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:18.450
He's got to be dumb enough to do it.

2:05:19.744 --> 2:05:21.244
Start getting ready.

2:05:28.586 --> 2:05:30.587
What was all that about, Major?

2:05:30.963 --> 2:05:33.590
Well, someone's come up
with a real nightmare.

2:05:36.510 --> 2:05:37.886
Real nightmare.

2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:52.150
We just got word from
the Dutch resistance people at Arnhem.

2:05:52.234 --> 2:05:54.944
-And?
-lt's not going too well for the British.

2:05:55.071 --> 2:05:57.155
Their main force never reached the bridge,

2:05:57.239 --> 2:05:59.366
and those that did
are hanging on by their fingernails.

2:05:59.450 --> 2:06:01.826
-And General Urquhart?
-He's got his back to the river.

2:06:01.911 --> 2:06:03.536
The Germans have trapped
his men in a pocket

2:06:03.621 --> 2:06:05.580
and they're squeezing it
smaller and smaller.

2:06:05.664 --> 2:06:07.207
How long can he hold?

2:06:09.960 --> 2:06:11.961
Where are those goddamn boats?

2:06:28.646 --> 2:06:30.105
Just keep it clear.

2:06:30.189 --> 2:06:31.356
Right.

2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:33.858
They're no further than we thought.

2:06:34.276 --> 2:06:35.443
-Julian.
-COOK: Sir?

2:06:35.528 --> 2:06:37.529
We've a little change in plans.

2:06:38.406 --> 2:06:40.990
We're going to make
the crossing in daylight.

2:06:41.534 --> 2:06:42.534
Daylight.

2:06:42.618 --> 2:06:44.244
Traffic's all screwed up for miles.

2:06:44.328 --> 2:06:46.287
By the time we're ready, it'll be 0800.

2:06:46.372 --> 2:06:47.789
That's when we go.

2:06:48.207 --> 2:06:49.332
Fine.

2:06:49.875 --> 2:06:53.545
l'd like to wait and go tomorrow night,
but the British can't hold.

2:06:54.880 --> 2:06:56.339
Better by daylight.

2:06:57.716 --> 2:06:58.842
Much.

2:07:05.641 --> 2:07:07.267
-Any news of the boats?
-No.

2:07:07.351 --> 2:07:09.310
We're switching. . . You want some?

2:07:09.395 --> 2:07:10.728
No, thank you.

2:07:11.021 --> 2:07:13.690
We're switching
the start till 9:00 just to make sure.

2:07:13.774 --> 2:07:16.234
You start laying smoke just before we go.

2:07:16.402 --> 2:07:17.652
Fine. Fine.

2:07:17.736 --> 2:07:20.780
They're gonna get creamed
from the far embankment.

2:07:20.865 --> 2:07:23.741
Your smoke screen's gonna be
their only protection.

2:07:24.243 --> 2:07:25.368
Don't worry.

2:07:25.828 --> 2:07:27.203
We'll cover you.

2:07:27.955 --> 2:07:29.080
Please.

2:07:39.175 --> 2:07:41.217
Okay, can l have your attention, please?

2:07:41.302 --> 2:07:43.052
Can l have your attention?

2:07:43.554 --> 2:07:45.889
l'm pleased to inform you
that our 9:00 departure

2:07:45.973 --> 2:07:47.724
has been postponed till 1 0:00.

2:07:47.808 --> 2:07:50.894
So you can all have
an extra hour's fun and relaxation.

2:07:51.645 --> 2:07:52.770
-Major.
-Yes?

2:07:52.855 --> 2:07:55.315
We got any more information
on those boats?

2:07:55.399 --> 2:07:57.775
We're reliably informed that they float.

2:07:58.235 --> 2:08:00.320
Outside of that, we don't know squat.

2:08:00.404 --> 2:08:03.114
Not how many,
not how heavy, not how big.

2:08:03.866 --> 2:08:07.535
We are sure that the river is wide
and that the current is strong.

2:08:07.912 --> 2:08:09.996
And as any more
cheery information comes my way,

2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:11.664
l'll just be too happy to pass it along.

2:08:11.749 --> 2:08:15.001
ln the meantime,
just think of this as on-the-job training.

2:08:18.088 --> 2:08:20.340
What's the matter, no sense of humor?

2:08:22.343 --> 2:08:23.510
God damn it!

2:08:25.596 --> 2:08:26.888
We go at noon.

2:08:39.777 --> 2:08:41.945
Come on ! Clear it off the road !

2:09:14.228 --> 2:09:18.314
You men are probably wondering
why l've called us here together.

2:09:19.775 --> 2:09:23.570
l've reached a decision
that l'd like to share with you all.

2:09:25.406 --> 2:09:27.907
l intend to go across
like George Washington,

2:09:27.992 --> 2:09:29.534
standing on the prow.

2:09:30.286 --> 2:09:32.078
You guys can do the rowing.

2:09:39.837 --> 2:09:41.588
That's it! Move them out!

2:09:50.514 --> 2:09:51.764
Come on.

2:09:59.189 --> 2:10:00.315
What the. . .

2:10:01.025 --> 2:10:04.819
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload them !

2:10:14.038 --> 2:10:15.538
Careful. Careful !

2:10:19.043 --> 2:10:21.336
Pull it! Son of a bitch ! Pull it up!

2:10:22.087 --> 2:10:23.421
How many more?

2:10:23.505 --> 2:10:24.881
Get those sides up.

2:10:24.965 --> 2:10:26.174
Fire!

2:10:33.057 --> 2:10:34.098
(lN GERMAN)

2:10:34.183 --> 2:10:35.725
What else can you see
besides smoke?

2:10:35.809 --> 2:10:39.187
Nothing yet, but they are
going to try a river assault.

2:10:40.397 --> 2:10:41.648
lt will fail.

2:10:41.732 --> 2:10:44.442
Of course it will fail, but. . .

2:10:44.526 --> 2:10:47.487
what do we do if it doesn't?

2:10:47.571 --> 2:10:50.239
l ask your permission
to blow up the bridge.

2:10:50.324 --> 2:10:51.824
Out of the question.

2:10:53.786 --> 2:10:55.870
l understand, Field Marshal.

2:10:56.830 --> 2:11:00.917
They will not cross the river
and we will blow no bridges.

2:11:01.001 --> 2:11:02.919
Have the demolition charges
been checked?

2:11:03.003 --> 2:11:05.963
Yes, sir.
Everything is wired and ready.

2:11:06.048 --> 2:11:08.883
Captain Kraft
is standing by as ordered.

2:11:10.427 --> 2:11:13.805
The bridge will not fall
into enemy hands.

2:11:14.515 --> 2:11:17.517
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross. . .

2:11:18.644 --> 2:11:19.977
l'll blow it sky-high.

2:11:32.991 --> 2:11:36.119
-Let's get going !
-All right! Go, go, go!

2:11:55.222 --> 2:11:58.224
Hurry, get to the water!
Go on, go on, go, boy, go!

2:12:05.733 --> 2:12:07.275
Let's go, come on !

2:12:11.363 --> 2:12:13.281
Jump in, boys. Let's move.

2:12:19.830 --> 2:12:22.457
lf you don't have an oar,
use your rifle butt!

2:12:22.541 --> 2:12:24.500
Anything ! Row! Row!

2:12:50.110 --> 2:12:51.819
(CHANTlNG) One! Two!

2:12:59.328 --> 2:13:02.121
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right!

2:13:09.379 --> 2:13:12.381
-Support fire ordered, sir.
-GAVlN: Right. Thank you.

2:13:14.802 --> 2:13:16.052
Row!

2:13:34.154 --> 2:13:35.363
Get down !

2:13:40.077 --> 2:13:45.748
Go! Go!

2:13:48.252 --> 2:13:52.588
Hail Mary, full of grace.

Hail Mary.

Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

Keep rowing !

2:14:20.784 --> 2:14:22.118
Straight ahead !

2:14:24.288 --> 2:14:30.710
Hail Mary, full of grace.

2:14:31.670 --> 2:14:33.337
We're drifting ! Pull to your left!

2:14:33.422 --> 2:14:35.965
-Come on, pull !
-COOK: Hail Mary, full of grace.

2:14:38.635 --> 2:14:40.970
Go, boys. Keep rowing !

2:14:41.221 --> 2:14:43.306
Hail Mary, full of grace.

2:14:44.349 --> 2:14:48.102
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

2:14:49.813 --> 2:14:50.938
Stay down !

Hail Mary.

Hail Mary, full of grace.

Thy will be done.

2:15:22.095 --> 2:15:23.346
Let's go!

2:15:38.654 --> 2:15:40.696
Snipers! Snipers!

2:15:52.084 --> 2:15:57.588
Help me. Help me.

2:16:15.065 --> 2:16:16.399
Go up the side!

2:16:28.161 --> 2:16:30.955
-Can we make it through the tunnel?
-No way, sir.

2:16:33.625 --> 2:16:36.168
-Get up the bank.
-l'm with you, sir.

2:16:49.349 --> 2:16:50.808
Cover. Cover.

2:17:00.110 --> 2:17:01.277
Come on.

2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:04.280
Let's go. Right here.

2:17:09.619 --> 2:17:10.953
Follow me up here.

2:17:45.655 --> 2:17:48.407
Sergeant! Take four across. Draw fire.

2:17:48.492 --> 2:17:50.951
Harry and l'll go up the side. You cover.

2:17:51.161 --> 2:17:53.746
-Go!
-Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2:17:59.336 --> 2:18:01.629
-Come on.
-Come on ! Let's go!

2:18:21.191 --> 2:18:22.233
(lN GERMAN)

2:18:22.317 --> 2:18:23.609
Are you ready?

2:18:23.693 --> 2:18:24.860
Yes, General.

2:18:35.372 --> 2:18:36.539
Cover me.

2:18:40.877 --> 2:18:42.628
Damn it. God damn it.

2:19:12.534 --> 2:19:13.534
(lN GERMAN)

2:19:13.618 --> 2:19:14.618
Now.

2:19:17.122 --> 2:19:18.122
Now!

2:19:18.999 --> 2:19:22.251
Again !

2:19:32.220 --> 2:19:33.220
(lN GERMAN)

2:19:33.305 --> 2:19:36.640
My God, they're only
1 8 kilometers from Arnhem.

2:19:37.767 --> 2:19:39.685
Who can stop them now?

2:19:41.646 --> 2:19:43.022
No one.

2:20:03.168 --> 2:20:04.585
Come on !

2:20:15.472 --> 2:20:16.847
Oh, hell.

2:20:17.182 --> 2:20:18.807
Any chance, Whitney?

2:20:19.142 --> 2:20:21.477
Not unless we're relieved
in the next few hours, sir.

2:20:21.561 --> 2:20:22.978
FROST: Harry?

2:20:23.355 --> 2:20:25.064
Try and get him down
to the cellar, will you?

2:20:25.148 --> 2:20:26.649
Very good, sir.

2:20:52.217 --> 2:20:53.425
lt's working.

2:20:53.927 --> 2:20:55.844
l'm through to HQ. Where's the colonel?

2:20:55.929 --> 2:20:57.638
-Down below.
-Well, get him ! Get him.

2:43:00.919 --> 2:43:02.920
Now, the wounded,
who are too bad to move,

2:43:03.005 --> 2:43:04.839
will replace the men firing,

2:43:05.632 --> 2:43:07.800
so our defense will seem as before.

2:43:08.135 --> 2:43:10.595
By the time the Germans
find out what's happening,

2:43:10.679 --> 2:43:13.139
we should all be safely across the river.

2:43:14.891 --> 2:43:18.185
-Pleasant journey.
-ALL: Thank you, sir.

2:43:46.590 --> 2:43:49.675
-Are you all right, laddie?
-Thank you, sir.

2:45:13.343 --> 2:45:16.721
l'm beginning to believe
we're actually going to make it, sir.

2:45:16.805 --> 2:45:19.640
l thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.

2:46:56.780 --> 2:46:59.406
General Browning will be
down right away, sir.

2:47:05.747 --> 2:47:08.791
He wondered if you perhaps
might like to change.

2:47:09.376 --> 2:47:10.584
Change?

2:47:10.836 --> 2:47:12.253
Your clothes, sir.

2:47:14.130 --> 2:47:15.506
No, thanks.

Hello, Roy.

2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:38.445
How are you?

2:47:39.865 --> 2:47:42.283
l'm not sure that l'll know for a while,

2:47:44.035 --> 2:47:46.537
but l'm sorry about the way it worked out.

2:47:48.123 --> 2:47:49.707
You did all you could.

2:47:51.918 --> 2:47:54.211
Yes, but did everyone else?

2:47:58.425 --> 2:48:01.260
They've got a bed
for you upstairs if you want it.

l took 1 0,000 men into Arnhem.

2:48:04.806 --> 2:48:06.891
l've come out with less than two.

2:48:07.309 --> 2:48:09.351
l don't feel much like sleeping.

2:48:10.687 --> 2:48:11.854
Quite.

2:48:14.816 --> 2:48:16.650
l've just been on to Monty.

2:48:18.445 --> 2:48:20.279
He's very proud and pleased.

2:48:21.531 --> 2:48:24.199
-Pleased?
-Of course.

2:48:25.201 --> 2:48:27.828
He thinks Market Garden
was 90% successful.

2:48:29.789 --> 2:48:31.373
But what do you think?

2:48:34.336 --> 2:48:38.422
Well, as you know, l've always thought
that we tried to go a bridge too far.

2:49:09.829 --> 2:49:11.038
Mind his head.
