BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

00:07.425 --> 00:10.007
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.178 --> 00:13.170
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.089
I ﬁght crime and ﬁnd other meta-humans
like me.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.758
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.936 --> 00:21.973
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.097
And I am the only one fast enough
to stop them.

00:28.321 --> 00:29.686
CISCO: Previously on The Flash...

00:29.864 --> 00:32.321
When my mother left us, she was pregnant.

00:32.491 --> 00:35.233
Dad, I'm so sony
that I didn't tell you sooner.

00:35.411 --> 00:38.369
Hi. I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.325
You want Bany to get faster.

00:40.499 --> 00:44.959
The more power he has,
the more I can take.

00:45.129 --> 00:46.244
(CRYING) Don't let him take me back.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.628
I won't.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.754
And you're going to help me

00:49.926 --> 00:52.963
in return for your daughter's life.

00:53.137 --> 00:56.049
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.968
BARRY: I know I'm moving pretty fast, but
stop me if you've heard this one before.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.307
Boy meets girl. Happens every day.

01:04.482 --> 01:08.145
Except this boy was struck by lightning
and became the fastest man alive.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.776
So, nothing is ever that simple.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.693
-(EXCLAIMS)
-Oh, my... Oh, uh... Careful.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.943
-Hol Sony. It's all good. It's all good.
-(CHUCKLING)

01:20.122 --> 01:22.113
Those... Those weren't
for me anyway, right?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.668
They were. I didn't realize
roses were so ﬂammable.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.041
Oh, my God.

01:26.212 --> 01:28.828
Well, it's the... It's the thought
that counts.

01:29.006 --> 01:32.794
And, you know, proper ﬁre safety
management, that counts most.

01:33.594 --> 01:38.429
Yes. I have spent most of my life
feeling very unlucky.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.839
Yeah, and now?

01:40.518 --> 01:42.725
Feels like I've been
struck by lightning twice.

02:21.892 --> 02:26.807
Okay, so, there's my desk.
Upstairs is Anti-Crime and the CSI lab.

02:26.981 --> 02:30.690
That's where Bany works.
And we have the open ﬁles...

02:30.860 --> 02:34.148
And that is a pencil. That, stapler.

02:34.322 --> 02:38.031
Okay. Sony, Wally. Obviously,
your sister got the funny genes.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.986
Captain, I want you to meet somebody.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.447
This is my son. Wally West.

02:42.747 --> 02:43.987
Handsome young man. Joe.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.575
Hey, he's a West. He can't help that.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.741
Your pops here is a hell of a detective.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.249
Obviously not.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.337
Pleasure to meet you, Wally.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.000
Anyway. I'm glad you're here, Wally.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.545
Yeah, I've always wanted a baby brother.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.468
You're joking but.
yeah, we did call Bany that.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.683
He's been pretty busy. He's doing
a whole lot of running around.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.690
But. why don't we do dinner?
The whole family?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.361
I... I got plans.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.779
.MIMII

03:15.946 --> 03:18.107
Dad, we just met the kid.
We don't want to kill him.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.694
All right. We do take-out.
Chinese. whatever. Come on.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.904
Where are your cuffs, Tail Lights?

03:24.038 --> 03:25.369
Come on. Let's go.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.745
I'mmmm;

03:27.083 --> 03:32.373
Uh, no, no. You know, it's just
what they say. I got one of those faces.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.125
I'll see you guys at dinner.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.540
Okay.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.260
Any chance I could chat with you
for a minute?

03:42.431 --> 03:43.716
Yeah. What's up, Detective?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.590
Oh, I— I meant Iris.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.559
Yeah. You're not needed.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.973
I am needed. Somewhere.
I'm gonna go there.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.353
(CHUCKLES)

03:55.569 --> 03:57.230
What can I do for you?

03:58.155 --> 04:01.067
Uh, I just wanted to talk with you...

04:01.909 --> 04:03.149
About Bany.

04:05.621 --> 04:10.115
I know that Bany's. you know,
practically your brother

04:10.292 --> 04:13.659
so I understand that your loyalty
is obviously to him, not me.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.796
but I was just hoping that maybe
you would think I'm good for him,

04:16.966 --> 04:19.082
so you'd want to help me ﬁgure him out.
(CHUCKLES)

04:20.219 --> 04:23.006
Well, I mean, if you did that,
you would be the ﬁrst.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.341
-Wonderful. That gives me tons of hope.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

04:25.683 --> 04:27.264
It's just... Um...

04:29.353 --> 04:32.811
He's being... Not "distant" but—

04:32.982 --> 04:34.017
Km

04:34.191 --> 04:36.056
Yeah. He's being guarded.

04:36.235 --> 04:39.819
And he's waking up from these bad dreams
and not telling me about them.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.901
And I know that we got close really quick.

04:43.075 --> 04:46.818
It's just... It's like
there's something holding him back.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.361
Here's the thing about Bany.

04:49.832 --> 04:55.122
He has a bad habit of canying
the weight of the world on his shoulders.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.799
Which is exactly what you should tell him.

05:02.887 --> 05:04.218
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

05:14.148 --> 05:15.479
(CLATTERING)

05:17.902 --> 05:20.234
Heyl No. Absolutely not.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.104
You don't get to throw somebody else's
stuff when you're pissed off.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.610
(CLATTERING)

05:26.619 --> 05:28.075
Thank you.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.373
mummy}

05:35.920 --> 05:37.410
Wrong answers.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.496
Maybe you're asking the wrong questions.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.505
I'll m 5111} m1

05:42.676 --> 05:44.507
I've been thinking about this a lot
recently.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.340
We keep trying to come up with ways
to make Bany faster.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.598
but I still think we can ﬁgure out a way
to make Zoom slower.

05:50.768 --> 05:53.384
We tried that already, remember?
Those darts didn't slow him down at all.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.938
Yeah, I know. I'm not
talking about the darts, okay?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.357
The darts clearly didn't work.
They just pissed him off.

05:57.525 --> 06:01.188
I'm talking about something else.
A way we can steal Zoom's speed.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.815
mm

06:08.619 --> 06:09.734
The Turtle.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.372
As some of you may well know,

06:12.540 --> 06:16.499
I've been deeply embroiled in a secret.
one-sided battle with an invisible enemy.

06:16.669 --> 06:18.455
No. Not the Turtle again.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.870
What? What is the—
Who is the Turtle?

06:22.591 --> 06:23.671
Half whale, half turtle.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.921
Mmm, no. Do you see what you're doing,
Caitlin? Everybody's confused now.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.176
Get to it.

06:28.347 --> 06:31.510
I stumbled upon a few of these cases when
we were looking for the Reverse-Flash.

06:31.684 --> 06:34.300
Robberies that were seemingly
committed at high-speed.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.139
People holding their beloved items
one second,

06:36.313 --> 06:37.598
those items were gone the next.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.104
Tell me what you see.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.861
So he can, what? Stop time?

06:47.032 --> 06:50.115
No, no, no. Look at the time code.
It's still running.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.029
Yeah, okay. So if he's not stopping time,
what is he doing?

06:55.457 --> 06:57.664
He's slowing down everything around him.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.789
And that is why we call him The Turtle.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.795
Why have you never
mentioned this guy to me before?

07:03.966 --> 07:06.503
Oh, I don't know. I think we've just been
a little distracted, you know?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.838
What with Captain Cold, and the
Weather Vlﬁzard, and Gorilla Grodd.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.093
Do I need to go on?

07:10.264 --> 07:12.926
Okay, so, if we can catch him,
ﬁgure out how he uses his powers...

07:13.100 --> 07:15.887
Maybe we can show Zoom
what life is like in the slow lane.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.676
How would you even know where to ﬁnd him?

07:17.855 --> 07:20.562
Well, the robberies in the videos
all correspond with police reports

07:20.733 --> 07:23.725
that were dismissed as
"lost or missing items" instead of thefts.

07:23.902 --> 07:24.891
The suspect's MO being?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.731
Items of immense personal value.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.114
Huh...

07:35.623 --> 07:39.036
Ohl It appears that there's
a press conference at CCPD

07:39.209 --> 07:41.996
because the Vandervoort diamonds
have just been recovered.

07:43.339 --> 07:46.126
From hell's heart, I stab at the.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.676
The perpetrators who committed this
heartless crime have been apprehended,

07:50.846 --> 07:52.131
and are now in our custody.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.591
And we're happy to report

07:53.766 --> 07:56.553
that the famed Vandervoort diamonds have
been retumed to their rightful owner.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.844
The real gem is the return
of my great grandfather's ring.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.397
Getting that retumed to the family
is what's most priceless to me.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.727
{CHE}?!

08:30.511 --> 08:32.877
The ring is gone. What happened to it?

08:33.263 --> 08:36.551
Lock this place down. No one
leaves this room. Sweep the Precinct.

08:42.439 --> 08:43.554
Well, the good news is,

08:43.732 --> 08:46.269
whatever the Turtle did,
it only affected you temporarily.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.773
Yol What was it like?
Being in Turtle Time?

08:49.947 --> 08:53.155
Yeah. No, it was weird.
It was like waves of inertness.

08:53.325 --> 08:56.533
Like all the energy was suddenly sucked
out of my body. and then it would return.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.569
That's because
that's exactly what was happening.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.659
He has the ability to transfer all the
surrounding kinetic energy into himself.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.416
Leaving everyone else
in a temporary state of potential energy.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.666
That's right.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.586
So why could I still move?

09:07.840 --> 09:11.958
Your speed. Your speed allows you to
change positions faster than anyone else.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.969
So you can convert your stored
potential energy back to kinetic energy.

09:15.139 --> 09:16.379
Excuse me. Where are you going?

09:16.557 --> 09:18.422
Trying to ﬁgure out how to use this
against Zoom.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.179
I'm mar-Tm

09:22.396 --> 09:24.102
"Cisco, please join me.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.731
"
e'll use your idea, and take it to new
scientiﬁc heights and save the world."

09:27.901 --> 09:29.186
"Yes, I'd love to."

09:29.695 --> 09:33.688
Okayl Facial recognition software
found us a match

09:33.866 --> 09:39.111
from the press conference footage.
The Turtle's name is Russell Glosson.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.653
He was a small-time thief,

09:40.831 --> 09:43.493
who stopped thieving
after the particle accelerator explosion.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.999
All right, I'm gonna head to work.
Catch Joe up.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.161
Let me know if you ﬁnd out
anything else.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.915
You okay?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.718
Yeah, yeah. It's just... (CLEARING THROAT)

09:57.014 --> 10:01.678
It's hard to look at that and not think
about how I can't help people anymore.

10:01.852 --> 10:05.094
Well, we have lots of technology here.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.268
Why don't we ﬁgure out
how to get your speed back?

10:08.734 --> 10:10.816
(INHALES) I'm a scientist too, Caitlin.

10:10.986 --> 10:14.524
And when I ﬁrst got here, all I did was
work on how to get my speed back.

10:15.199 --> 10:18.032
Believe me. whatever test you could run...

10:19.036 --> 10:20.742
I've already done it.

10:27.711 --> 10:28.951
JOE: The Turtle?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.370
Cisco's been looking for this guy forever.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.163
Singh just put an APB out on him.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.084
Um... How did everybody know
about Glosson before I did?

10:36.345 --> 10:39.303
Mmm. Cisco's got a whole list of
unidentiﬁed metas.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.548
The boys around here are calling him
Cisco de La Mancha.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.141
(CHUCKLES)

10:45.687 --> 10:47.678
Hey, are you good?
You seem a little jittery.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.891
h‘iiﬂm

10:51.652 --> 10:54.689
I'm really nervous about
this whole dinner tonight with Wally.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.319
Come on. Why are you...
Why are you nervous?

10:56.490 --> 10:58.856
You're, like, the best dad ever.
He'll see that.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.276
(SIGHS) It'll be a whole lot easier
with you being there.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.111
Joe, I wouldn't miss it.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.372
-See you tonight.
-All right.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.495
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.038
-You got a sec?
-Yeah.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.331
I just...

11:16.301 --> 11:18.292
I just want to make sure
everything's okay.

11:18.637 --> 11:19.752
man

11:20.055 --> 11:22.762
Yeah, I'm... I, uh, don't want to nag.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.639
That's not. you know, who I am. Ijust...

11:26.186 --> 11:28.928
I don't want you to feel burdened
by anything.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.686
No, I don't.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.564
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

11:33.110 --> 11:38.776
Yeah, wait, Patty. The New Years
is always a hard time for me.

11:39.616 --> 11:40.776
It's when my mom died.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.987
so just those memories all come out
and they're hard to put away.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.534
So if it feels like
I haven't been communicating...

11:44.705 --> 11:46.115
I'm sony— I'm sony. I didn't know.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.746
No, no, no.

11:48.917 --> 11:53.456
Look, um. we haven't had a romantic night
in a while.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.080
What do you say, tomorrow night,
we get some dinner and drinks,

11:57.968 --> 12:00.050
and maybe a little kissing...

12:00.220 --> 12:01.505
IIMHHKMMI

12:11.899 --> 12:14.356
Okay, I think we can call it.
Wally is not coming.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.314
I'm sony, Joe.
I know how much this meant to you.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.399
He's a kid. right? I get it.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.942
:mslmmmlm

12:25.120 --> 12:27.577
Well, there could be a number of reasons
why he didn't.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.949
Thank you for being here. I love you.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.667
-I love you.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.833

12:38.008 --> 12:39.214

12:44.640 --> 12:48.258
Well, West family 2.0
is not really off to a great start.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.347
You've been quiet all evening.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.354
NEWER

12:54.691 --> 12:56.192
How do you know about him?

12:56.526 --> 12:57.811
(CHUCKLES)

12:58.111 --> 13:01.899
No, errn. No. Just had a lot on my mind.

13:03.367 --> 13:08.077
Patty? We... We may have met for coffee.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.038
She really cares about you, Bany.

13:12.209 --> 13:15.121
And she's just wondering
why you've been so "guarded."

13:15.295 --> 13:16.705
And what did you tell her?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.996
I told her to talk to you.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.539
Oh, that's not cool.

13:21.593 --> 13:26.713
You know, she did mention
that you've been having nightmares.

13:28.266 --> 13:32.430
About Zoom killing her.

13:34.940 --> 13:40.731
Look, I know that things have been
moving pretty fast between you two.

13:42.406 --> 13:45.022
But you realize you can't keep things
from her forever, right?

13:45.659 --> 13:48.822
One day, you're going to have to
tell her the truth.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.245
That I'm The Flash? I can't do that.

13:53.250 --> 13:57.038
Bany... I wish a year ago,
you had told me the truth.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.918
So, what?
You think that I should just tell her?

13:59.381 --> 14:03.624
I think that if you are serious
about being with her,

14:05.429 --> 14:06.669
you have to.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.269
All right. Then that's what I'm gonna do.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.470
I'll tell Patty I'm The Flash.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.942
Hey. You guys got anything?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.278
I think we found the next target for

14:32.456 --> 14:35.163
our 30-something
metahuman-not-a-ninja Turtle.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.869
How long did it take you
to come up with that one?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.709
It just came out of my mouth.
Did you see that? That was amazing.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.416
Central City Museum is hosting
a special black-tie event tonight

14:42.591 --> 14:44.422
showcasing The Crystal Ball.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.133
It's a famous painting, apparently.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.714
recently recovered from Markovia.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.972
The painting is on loan to the museum
from the Silverberg family.

14:52.225 --> 14:56.013
Jacob Silverberg, himself, said, "The
painting's safe return means more to us

14:56.188 --> 14:58.179
"than all the money in the world."

14:58.356 --> 15:00.312
It's like they're begging Turtle
to rob it.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.145
Okay. yes. This is a plan.

15:02.319 --> 15:08.315
So, the Turtle will make his move, and
we can be there waiting to take him down.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.493
How do you look in a tux?

15:10.660 --> 15:14.448
Come on. He's 6'2", he's square-jawed
and he's jacked. I think he looks ﬁne.

15:14.664 --> 15:15.653
I'm 6'4".

15:15.832 --> 15:17.083
Oh, crap.

,mam:

15:19.044 --> 15:21.751
No. No.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.630
An opportunity. Maybe. Hold on.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.173
Hey, you. I'm excited to see you tonight.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.384
Yeah, me too. Actually. about that, um...

15:33.683 --> 15:38.302
So I know I said let's have dinner, but.
uh, you've been wanting me to share more.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.644
So, I thought that I would share
that I love art.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.184
Okay. Interesting.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.774
Yeah. No, it'sjust, you know,
I can't get enough of art.

15:47.948 --> 15:51.486
Anyway, there's this event
at the Central City Museum tonight.

15:51.660 --> 15:54.572
They're showing this really famous
painting that I've always loved.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.364
Actually, I don't know anything about art.

15:58.542 --> 16:04.037
But. what's the saying? I know what
I like, and I like you, so count me in.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.170
All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.372
ALL: 7:00.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.707
Or 7:00. I'll see you at 7:00.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.466
Okay. 7:00 it is.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.717
Bye.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.760
You know, you're a really great superhero,
a really great superhero...

16:15.934 --> 16:17.014
Thanks. Thank you.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.552
But. do you think it's a good idea, when
you're ﬁghting crime, to bring a date?

16:20.730 --> 16:24.268
I'm gonna tell Patty that I'm The Flash.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.059
What— Is that a bad idea?
What do we think?

16:28.238 --> 16:31.901
I will say, she put bullets
in King Shark and Hany.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.942
So, as far as I'm concerned,
that's Team Flash material to me.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.410
All right. Yes. Thank you, Cisco.
Yeah. Thank you.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.696
-Cool.
-Mmm...

16:39.124 --> 16:41.160
I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna tell her.

16:55.098 --> 16:58.682
That's nice. Then keep her
as far away from this as possible.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.551
And here's why.

17:01.104 --> 17:07.350
If Zoom ﬁnds out who you care for,
who you love, who you live for,

17:09.321 --> 17:11.152
he'll take them from you.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.381
(SIGHS) All right. Keep your eyes open
for the Turtle.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.800
A sentence I never thought I would say.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.774
Cisco, are you and Hany in position?

17:53.949 --> 17:57.157
CISCO: I'm in the security feed. I've got
the facial recognition software running,

17:57.327 --> 17:59.443
so we'll be able to spot Turtle
before he makes his move.

17:59.621 --> 18:00.861
(WHISPERS) Turtle.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.448
Why do you insist
on giving them ridiculous nicknames?

18:04.626 --> 18:08.289
Me? Who's the genius
that came up with "Zoom?"

18:12.217 --> 18:13.548
Yeah, well...

18:16.554 --> 18:17.680
I'll tell you.

18:17.847 --> 18:22.432
About two years ago,
this was on Earth-2 now,

18:24.104 --> 18:30.771
the CCPD there, they got a 911 call
about a hostage situation.

18:31.528 --> 18:35.362
But when the SWAT. team got there,
there were no hostages.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.860
It was a trap.

18:38.243 --> 18:43.533
Zoom set a trap in order to show
the police that they could not stop him.

18:44.624 --> 18:49.539
rtmlmmmnmmmmmrm

18:50.880 --> 18:55.249
Slaughtered them.
Left one alive to tell what happened.

18:55.969 --> 19:02.716
That ofﬁcer described blue lightning
zooming all about

19:03.935 --> 19:05.345
as his comrades,

19:05.562 --> 19:08.804
brothers- and sisters-in-arms,
were murdered.

19:10.525 --> 19:15.064
That ofﬁcer considered himself
to be a lucky one,

19:16.114 --> 19:18.776
spared in order to tell the tale.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.405
until Zoom went to his house that night
and killed him, too.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.241
Anyway, that's how
we got the nickname Zoom.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.961

to hide who I really am.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.357
You don't have to hide with me.

20:40.865 --> 20:44.653

I took you to the planetarium,
just you and me.

I took you out all by myself.

you held my hand for dear life.

40:36.226 --> 40:38.342
Or maybe it was the other way around.

40:38.812 --> 40:41.349
But it was in the Mars exhibit
that I lost you.

40:41.523 --> 40:44.014

40:44.192 --> 40:46.524
And in one minute, I had
every security guard looking for you,

40:46.695 --> 40:49.357
and I could feel the fear rise
in the back of my throat,

40:49.531 --> 40:51.863
and something else rising also.

40:57.414 --> 41:01.703
about what I would do
to the person who had taken you.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.746
The things I would do...

41:04.546 --> 41:06.537
Unspeakable things.

for certain
