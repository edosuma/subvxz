Arlene, actually, one of the
reasons why your jersey's not up

on the wall with the jersey

02:39.893 --> 02:42.827
Mount, it's as simple as
snapping it off the wall,

02:42.896 --> 02:45.998
Sliding the rod through
the--through the jersey...

02:46.066 --> 02:46.931
[arlene] yeah.

02:47.001 --> 02:47.933
[nyden]...And then clipping it
back on.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.467
-Just like that.
-[arlene] see, that's so smart.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.737

-[nyden] a couple quick fixes.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.371
You don't have to pin anything.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.807

the jersey, and that's how it's

02:55.875 --> 02:57.109
Gonna look.

02:57.111 --> 02:57.809
-It looks great up on the wall.
-[arlene] that's very cool.

02:57.878 --> 02:58.710
-[wes] wow.
-Easy-peasy.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.345
Easy-peasy, that's what it is,
yeah.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.348
It can come in any colour, and
it can also be custom branded.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.617

03:05.685 --> 03:08.353

on there.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.621
[manjit] it feels pretty light.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.689
It's made out of plastic?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.157
[nyden] it's abs plastic, yeah.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.625
It's super lightweight,
and the coolest thing about

03:13.693 --> 03:16.094
That actually is also you can
mount it using

03:16.162 --> 03:18.163
3m command strips,
so no screws, no nails.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.765
How much does it sell for?

03:19.833 --> 03:22.000
[nyden] on my website with free
shipping, it sells for $39.99.

03:22.736 --> 03:26.104
We have a three pack for $85.99
and a six pack for $159.99.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.673
And pretty much I can assure you
that we basically only sell

03:28.742 --> 03:30.576
Three and six packs.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.577
How long have you been working
on this?

03:32.580 --> 03:35.113
-This will be my seventh year.
-Seven years?

03:35.181 --> 03:36.615
-Seventh?
-Seven years.

03:37.317 --> 03:38.216
Holy smokes!

03:38.285 --> 03:39.618
What you been doing for seven
years?

03:39.686 --> 03:40.986
Hustling this product.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.121
[arlene] he's been selling them,
right?

03:43.189 --> 03:44.623
Yeah, so we've sold 80,000
units...

03:44.691 --> 03:45.757
Okay.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.192
[nyden]...But that's--I worked
hard to sell those.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.794
So what happened was I thought I
created the greatest product

03:49.863 --> 03:52.064
On the earth, so I went right to
retail, and I'm like,

03:52.132 --> 03:53.498
"everybody's gonna buy this,
obviously."

03:53.566 --> 03:55.066
-[michele] right.
-[chuckles]

03:55.069 --> 03:56.801
[nyden] and I learned, wait a
minute, they care about sales,

03:56.804 --> 03:59.404
Fulfilment, packaging, having
multiple skus

03:59.406 --> 04:00.505
And all this kind of stuff.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.074
Then the reality of running a
business set in.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.276
-Then that kicked in.
-[michele] yeah.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.378
[nyden] and then basically we
focused our business on local

04:06.446 --> 04:07.612
Tournaments and fundraising.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.282
We have a great fundraiser that
we do with a lot of local

04:10.350 --> 04:11.683
Sport teams.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.085
We're one of the first companies
to offer no upfront costs.

04:14.154 --> 04:17.522
So what we offer basically is an
ability for teams to sell

04:17.591 --> 04:18.623
The product ahead of time.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.824
They collect the money.

04:19.827 --> 04:20.892
They get the product at a
discount,

04:20.961 --> 04:22.994
And they keep 50% of
the proceeds so--

04:22.997 --> 04:23.895
That's brilliant.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.030
-Good idea.
-[nyden] yeah.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.731
What was your revenue last year,
nyden?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.500
-$222,000.
-Right.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.770
And in the past year,
I'm only at $56,000.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.438
Fundraising is not happening.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.474
A big part of our
business--after we went away

04:35.542 --> 04:38.576
From fundraising and
tournaments,

04:38.579 --> 04:39.444
We hit the trade show circuit.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.478
Got it.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.546
I've been to over 150 trade
shows in canada--

04:41.548 --> 04:43.048
So your sales have been cut due
to covid now?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.550
[nyden] yes, but our projected
sales are actually $250,000

04:45.618 --> 04:49.354
Because we just secured a big
deal with two major retailers

04:49.422 --> 04:50.388
In canada.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.490
So if you've been to 150 trade
shows...

04:52.559 --> 04:53.591
Yeah.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.226
[michele]...You've probably met
every single buyer?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.595
I met every associate buyer.

04:57.664 --> 05:00.098
Like, for instance, one of the
reasons why I'm here today is

05:00.100 --> 05:02.867
Fanatics has basically taken
over that entire industry right

05:02.936 --> 05:05.904
Now, so now in order to get in
with them, two things, one, you

05:05.972 --> 05:07.572
Have to speak to someone very
high up, which I've not been

05:07.574 --> 05:09.207
Able to, or I have to get the
product licensed.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.844
That's the one element that's
kind of been stopping me.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.614
I'm a little bit worried it's
the product is my problem.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.349
I don't think it's you.

05:17.417 --> 05:20.318
No, uh, we've been like one of
the best-selling booths

05:20.387 --> 05:21.886
At almost every trade show we've
ever been.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.389
I think the issue is this is a
niche and innovative

05:24.457 --> 05:25.290
New product.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.791
People don't know it exists.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.093
-But after seven years...
-Yeah.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.328
[manjit]...That's a bit of a
problem.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.361
[nyden] yeah.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.563
Well, the real problem is after
seven years,

05:31.631 --> 05:34.566
Why haven't you come to the den,
considering you're the biggest

05:34.568 --> 05:37.001
Fan of the duchess here, arlene.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.270
[nyden] well, I'm glad you asked
that.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.438
As a matter of fact, I've
applied to the show seven times.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.940
[michele] that's awesome!

05:42.008 --> 05:43.542
[nyden] yeah, believe me,
it's no fault of my own.

05:44.311 --> 05:47.112
I have been here every single
year trying to get on this show.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.279
-[arlene] yeah, that--
-I'm persistent and consistent.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.481
-I like that persistence.
-[nyden] yeah.

05:49.549 --> 05:53.151
And I think we're actually being
a little--80,000 units is

05:53.219 --> 05:54.419
Nothing to sneeze at.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.688
You're doing pretty good on your
own.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.056
Right, and that's where--yeah.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.224
And so what do you need the
$100,000 for?

06:00.293 --> 06:02.794
Right now, my cost per unit is
about $5.98.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.061
Whoa.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.030
[nyden] if I can start ordering
about 20,000 units per run,

06:06.099 --> 06:09.334
I can lower my manufacturing
costs and still keep it

06:09.403 --> 06:10.769
In canada by over 25%.

06:10.837 --> 06:13.004
-That's a big cost.
-[nyden] it is, it is.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.507
I did a small promotion with
labatt, was they actually wanted

06:15.575 --> 06:17.809
To buy 50,000 units to put
inside of beer cases.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.577
Okay.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.546
Unfortunately, they only offered
me $4 and my price was

06:21.548 --> 06:22.914
A lot higher.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.449
Right, and so that is where you
need help.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.417
[nyden] yeah, so right now--

06:25.485 --> 06:26.584
[michele] but if you've sold
80,000 units,

06:26.653 --> 06:28.887
You should have some buying
power to reduce your cost,

06:28.955 --> 06:30.455
Even if you wanna
stay in canada.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.456
Yeah.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.525
♪ ♪

06:34.594 --> 06:36.361
[arlene] so, nyden, I think you
just said exactly what

06:36.429 --> 06:38.363
The challenge will be for an
investor.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.198
This is a great promotional
company...

06:40.266 --> 06:41.566
[nyden] mm hmm.

06:41.634 --> 06:42.967
...But in terms of an investible
business that will scale

06:42.970 --> 06:45.236
To the tens of millions of
dollars, which is what I want

06:45.305 --> 06:49.374
To invest in, this won't get
there, and so I'm gonna be out,

06:49.376 --> 06:51.410
But could you spell my name
right next time?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.178
Yeah, I apologize.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.180
[arlene] don't, I just--no, no,
leave it up.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.015
No, this is a little fun thing
here.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.150
We're just gonna turn it around
when you guys say no.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.218
[arlene] okay, that's right.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.619
I look better from the front
than the back anyhow.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.989
[laughter]

07:05.692 --> 07:06.792
All right, that's one.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.861
So, nyden, I agree, like,
it's just--it's a great

07:09.930 --> 07:11.229
Lifestyle business.

07:11.231 --> 07:15.099
There's not enough money in it
for me to be interested in it.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.067
So for that reason, I'm out.

07:17.303 --> 07:20.705
The play for me at this point is
if fanatics--you get

07:20.773 --> 07:24.008
Fanatics--and is this gonna be a
$10 million business?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.343
No.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.612
You get fanatics, does it become
a $2 million a year business?

07:27.614 --> 07:29.214
Absolutely, it does.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.448
-And that's kind of--
-yeah.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.616
[nyden] yeah.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.017
Normally, for me to do a deal
like this I need to find

07:33.086 --> 07:36.188
A purpose for the item within my
pyramid already.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.958
I'm not feeling it in the sense
of how I can incorporate this

07:40.026 --> 07:42.961
With my overall investments,
so for that reason, I'll be out.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.297
Nyden, I like your persistence.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.933
-[nyden] okay.
-It is very evident.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.234
Mm hmm.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.035
[manjit] but I do wonder about
the innovation and whether the

07:51.038 --> 07:53.104
Product is really in demand.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.807
I will definitely give you a

07:56.977 --> 07:58.143
-Okay.
-...But I'm gonna be out.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.879
It's a great lifestyle business,
but not an investment,

08:00.947 --> 08:02.147
So good luck, but I'm out.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.146
Hello dragons, I'm gina el
kattan.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.582
I'm amal soliman.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.184
We are the co-founders of nuba
based out of oakville, ontario.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.222
[gina] we're asking for $75,000
for 15% of our company.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.860
We're a mother-daughter team
making canada's only certified

09:21.928 --> 09:24.496
Organic ready-to-drink hibiscus
tea.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.832
When we moved to canada from
egypt, we brought hibiscus

09:27.900 --> 09:29.234
Flowers with us.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.171
It's been a staple in our
culture for thousands of years.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.873
We created a modern brand to
bring a traditional superfood

09:35.942 --> 09:37.208
To canada.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.513
Nuba has a refreshing tart and
slightly sweet flavour,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.315
And it tastes amazing both hot
and cold.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.951
Nuba is jam-packed with health
benefits and has more

09:46.954 --> 09:48.486
Antioxidants than green tea.

09:49.188 --> 09:50.488
Hmm.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.625
So, dragons, who's ready to sip
on a refreshing opportunity?

09:54.761 --> 09:55.827
We'd love for you to try.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.129
[manjit] so hot or cold, it
doesn't matter?

09:58.197 --> 09:59.331
[amal] you can try them both.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.832
What do you prefer it as:
Hot or cold?

10:00.900 --> 10:02.100
-[gina] cold.
-Cold.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.435
Egypt is really hot,
so we usually have it cold.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.204
I've heard this is really
healthy for you.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.506
-[gina and amal] it is.
-It's gorgeous.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.743
That's really good,
that's really good.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.011
This is our classic,
which is sweetened

10:13.079 --> 10:14.278
With organic cane sugar.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.680
It tastes a lot like
pomegranates.

10:16.582 --> 10:18.616
We have an unsweetened which has
just hibiscus.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.385
And then our low-calorie is
sweetened with stevia.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.923
Tell us how much it costs you to
make it and what are you selling

10:25.992 --> 10:27.058
It for?

10:27.127 --> 10:31.863
It's costing $1.26,
and we're selling it for $1.99

10:31.865 --> 10:32.998
And retails for $3.99.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.166
-$3.99?
-[amal] mm hmm.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.001
Which is really in line with
your kombuchas,

10:37.070 --> 10:38.770
Your cold brew, so--

10:38.838 --> 10:41.105
That's for the single bottle of
the classic?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.607
-[amal] yes.
-And you're producing it where?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.276
We have our own facility in
oakville.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.412
And did you have some previous
experience in this?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.647
We drink it all the time.

10:48.715 --> 10:52.150
It's been time-tested for 7,000
years because it was one

10:52.218 --> 10:53.952
Of the pharaohs'

10:54.688 --> 10:56.120
[gina] my mom is being humble.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.290

11:00.860 --> 11:02.260
-[michele] oh my goodness.
-[manjit] that makes sense.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.729
-[arlene] that helps.
-She's being humble.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.097
And where are you selling it
right now?

11:06.899 --> 11:09.634
[gina] so we have over 1,000
points of distribution.

11:09.702 --> 11:13.905
The gourmet health food stores,
also the middle eastern stores

11:13.973 --> 11:15.206
As well, and then a little bit
online.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.408
We're gonna be launching this
summer at sobeys

11:17.477 --> 11:20.712
And whole foods, and we're
really proud to say that we are

11:20.780 --> 11:22.981
Very far along in the process of
getting listed at loblaws.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.453
We are on track to do $250,000
this year.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.123
Can you claim any health
benefits with this product?

11:33.126 --> 11:38.063
We can, but I think it's a
bigger hassle to claim

11:38.131 --> 11:39.397
The health benefits.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.900
It's been really known for so
long that it's been healthy,

11:41.968 --> 11:44.269
And it's specifically for
lowering blood pressure.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.637
But I think in your part of the
world,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.072
It's much more
common knowledge...

11:48.141 --> 11:49.340
[amal] it is common, yes.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.875
...Than for many canadians,
which is why I think there's

11:50.944 --> 11:52.644
Actually a benefit of putting it
on your bottle.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.846
Like, I think that it's just a
much more niche population

11:54.914 --> 11:56.181
That know about how good this is
for you.

11:56.917 --> 11:57.849
-[gina] yeah.
-Yes, you're right.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.283
We've done lot of education.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.252
We still obviously do a lot of
samplings and trade shows

12:01.320 --> 12:04.355
And things like that,
but there's still a long way

12:04.423 --> 12:05.757
To go in terms of awareness.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.258
So how much money did you invest
in the company?

12:08.427 --> 12:11.262
-We invested $180,000.
-[wes and arlene] wow.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.263
$180,000?

12:12.331 --> 12:13.397
[arlene] is that for the
equipment that you have?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.866
-Is that mostly--
-[amal] yeah, equipment.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.568
-And do you have any debt?
-No.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.902
[arlene] so, it's all your cash
that--hard-earned cash

12:17.970 --> 12:19.170
That you've put into this?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.371
-Yes, yeah.
-[arlene] yes.

12:20.439 --> 12:21.439
And so is the rest of the family
involved too,

12:21.507 --> 12:22.940
Or just mother,
daughter?

12:23.009 --> 12:23.941
It's mostly mother, daughter...

12:24.010 --> 12:24.876
[amal] mostly mother, daughter.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.177
[manjit] okay.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.812
...But we--my dad would be very
upset if we didn't mention him

12:27.880 --> 12:31.315
On<i> dragons' den</i> since it's his
favourite show, so he's--him

12:31.318 --> 12:33.318
And my brother are avid
supporters [laughs].

12:34.321 --> 12:38.089
Actually, I wanted to briefly
mention we're really passionate

12:38.157 --> 12:39.690
About supporting small-scale
farmers.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.526
So it's in southern egypt;
it's called nuba which is

12:41.594 --> 12:43.661
Where our family's from.

12:43.729 --> 12:46.464
My mom, she's humble, she won't
brag, but I'll brag for her.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.267
She's done a lot of work in kind
of helping modernizing

12:49.335 --> 12:50.635
Their techniques.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.070
But obviously we're small, so
we've only been able to help a

12:53.139 --> 12:55.573
Handful, but we're really proud
of the impact we've had so far.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.676
I'm thinking about those little
girls back home watching this

12:58.744 --> 13:05.216
And seeing mother and daughter
standing here from egypt,

13:05.284 --> 13:08.620
Coming to this country, and now
they're going,

13:08.688 --> 13:10.588

13:11.490 --> 13:13.825
The message you're sending is so
powerful, right?

13:13.827 --> 13:14.959
Yeah.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.361
Just seeing your dream come true
and having loving people

13:17.430 --> 13:18.563

13:18.631 --> 13:19.897

13:19.899 --> 13:21.732

I think it's just fantastic.

13:21.735 --> 13:22.567

13:22.635 --> 13:23.835

-What's your dad's name?

13:24.937 --> 13:27.305
-Magdi.
-We mentioned him.

13:27.373 --> 13:28.840
That's all I wanted to make
sure.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.472
This is the one that my girls
will love.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.540
Because as you are aware,
little kids just don't get

19:36.609 --> 19:39.410
Enough about--talking about
farts [laughs].

19:39.478 --> 19:40.411
[lexy] it's true.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.346
Well, you know, it's actually a
brilliant idea.

19:42.414 --> 19:44.448
How this started, dragons, is
our son was born, our second

19:44.517 --> 19:47.952
Child, and we discovered he
needed to have surgery at the

19:48.020 --> 19:50.955
Hospital for sick children,
so I decided to leave my job

19:51.023 --> 19:54.758
To be with him during his
recovery, and while I was off,

19:54.827 --> 19:56.393
I started writing rhyming
stories for my daughter,

19:56.462 --> 19:57.761
Who was three at the time.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.763
I wanted to touch on the things
that we were going through,

19:59.832 --> 20:01.165
So I thought it was important to
write that book.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.102
And my son's doing better,
and he's healthy

20:05.170 --> 20:07.771
And he's doing great.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.373
But I thought seeing those kids,
I wanted to bring some joy

20:09.442 --> 20:12.576
To them, so I contacted the
hospital for sick children

20:12.645 --> 20:14.745
And was put in touch with the
right people, and so all of the

20:14.814 --> 20:16.513
Proceeds from the sale of the
book go to

20:16.516 --> 20:18.649
The hospital for sick children
and the sickkids foundation.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.554
So, encouraged by my wonderful
wife, I started touring the

20:23.622 --> 20:25.155
Books at local schools.

20:25.158 --> 20:26.957
You said you said you sold 2,000
units...

20:27.026 --> 20:28.659
-[lexy] of the cds.
-...Of the cd.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.994
[lexy] 6,000 units of the
book.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.529
[vincenzo] of the ten books?

20:31.597 --> 20:33.097
-[manjit] of how many?
-[lexy] of 14 books.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.465
14 books, 6,000.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.733
[lexy] we started initially with
12.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.069
My initial thought was to have a
subscription service,

20:38.137 --> 20:40.671
So I put 12 books out that
parents could subscribe to

20:40.673 --> 20:43.107
And get a book to their
door every month.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.408
Great idea.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.911
And then quickly it evolved
organically to the rap-a-long

20:47.980 --> 20:49.480
Because I saw the books come
alive.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.482
What I'm hearing is a lot of
iteration in this model,

20:51.550 --> 20:52.416
Right...

20:52.418 --> 20:53.618
Yeah, and so--

20:53.686 --> 20:56.621
[michele]...To move from books
to cds to subscription model

20:56.689 --> 20:57.488
To what you're doing today.

20:57.556 --> 20:58.556
Yes.

20:58.624 --> 21:01.225
And now, I've really changed
that direction again.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.428
I've realized I can reach a much
broader audience through

21:04.497 --> 21:05.763
Youtube.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.899
We've created a pilot episode
for a television show.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.201
[arlene] you've done about
$100,000 in sales,

21:11.270 --> 21:12.036
Is that right?

21:12.038 --> 21:13.003
Did I do the math right?

21:13.006 --> 21:14.639
$75,000 in accumulative sales to
date.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.639
[arlene] $75,000.

21:15.641 --> 21:16.840
And I put $100,000 into the
business.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.843
Funded it with the exit of my
previous company--a small

21:19.846 --> 21:22.379
Digital advertising agency.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.149
So the $75,000 is over how long?

21:25.217 --> 21:27.751
-Since 2018.
-This is your full-time job?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.186

21:29.254 --> 21:31.722

21:31.724 --> 21:32.790

six-year-old.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.293
-Which is also a full-time job.
-[lexy] yeah.

21:35.361 --> 21:38.228

think about what you're doing?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.229

21:39.232 --> 21:40.297
Is she in the business with you?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.066
She's my advisor in a way.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.701
She's come from an advertising
background.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.138

21:52.745 --> 21:53.911

21:53.979 --> 21:55.946
I've seen the trajectory of
the wiggles, arlene,

21:56.014 --> 21:58.415
And it's really about building a
content base first.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.551
As a parent, I wanna find a
brand that I appreciate--

22:00.553 --> 22:02.019
But you've got 14 books, lexy.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.754
Like, you have a lot of content.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.889
[lexy] yeah, but they didn't
come alive until the music came,

22:05.958 --> 22:07.157
Arlene.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.926
And also now until we've really
gotten into the digital space.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.961
But the wiggles and a lot of
those other brands, paw patrol,

22:11.029 --> 22:14.865
Et cetera, they had tons of
money and massive companies

22:14.867 --> 22:15.866

26:13.772 --> 26:15.072
My name is maran stern-kubista.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.541
And my name is
zola stern-kubista.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.810
We're from toronto, ontario.

26:20.412 --> 26:24.381
And today, we're asking you for
$30,000 for 15% of my company:

26:24.383 --> 26:25.783
My kindness calendar.

26:27.552 --> 26:29.954
I'm a mom of two, and just like
my kids, I love holidays.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.757
Teaching my kids to be kind,
think about others,

26:33.826 --> 26:36.593
And learn to appreciate not just
the getting but also the giving

26:36.662 --> 26:38.429
That happens at the holidays was
always important.

26:39.765 --> 26:43.433
So we started a new tradition of
our own with the classic idea

26:43.436 --> 26:44.668
Of the advent calendar.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.171
But instead of a sugary
chocolate, we counted down to

26:47.239 --> 26:49.906
Christmas by doing an act of
kindness for someone

26:49.909 --> 26:51.408
Every day instead.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.678
It started as our family
tradition and has now become

26:54.747 --> 26:55.879
My business.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.950
-My kindness calendar.
-Aww.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.853
[maran] so, zola, why don't you
get us started and choose one

27:02.921 --> 27:04.622
Of your favourites and put it on
the calendar for today.

27:05.991 --> 27:08.459
[dianne] the calendars come with
30 different decals.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.527
Kids choose one act of kindness
to do every day.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.932
-[dragons] aww.
-[manjit] please!

27:15.534 --> 27:17.434
I would love to be your
neighbour.

27:18.236 --> 27:20.070
[dianne] maran says the calendar
helps children improve skills

27:20.139 --> 27:22.039
Like critical thinking and
planning.

27:23.809 --> 27:24.841
[maran] thank you, sweetheart.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.276
-Thanks, zola.
-[michele] bye-bye.

27:26.344 --> 27:28.145
-[manjit] good helper, bye.
-[vincenzo] bye-bye, zola.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.948
[maran] so if you guys wanna
pick up your little gifts beside

27:31.951 --> 27:33.217
You, you'll see a couple of
things.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.386
It's the advent calendar,
as well as

27:36.455 --> 27:37.688
The be kind all
the time calendar.

27:39.025 --> 27:42.993
And you'll see inside, there's
also five customizable decals

27:43.061 --> 27:45.095
In there, so kids can come up
with their own ideas.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.831
I like these because I think
they're universal

27:47.899 --> 27:51.134
And for different ages, not just
young age groups,

27:51.203 --> 27:53.470
Such as "learn about a holiday
from another culture."

27:53.706 --> 27:55.406
Like, that's really actually
fantastic.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.809
I like this one, "teach someone
something new."

28:00.145 --> 28:03.246
Okay, is this just a single-sku
business, like with the advent

28:03.249 --> 28:06.450
And the kindness calendar, or is
there any form of, you know,

28:06.452 --> 28:07.918
Additional products that people
can buy?

28:07.986 --> 28:10.754
You know, customers have been
asking for these things

28:10.822 --> 28:12.055
For a long time.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.524
I personally needed ways to keep
my mindset positive and strong,

28:14.527 --> 28:17.261
And that's where my mindset
magnets came from.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.264
And what I've already seen,
for example from launching

28:20.332 --> 28:23.267
These new skus, is as soon as I
launch new products,

28:23.335 --> 28:25.869
They've been picked up,
by indigo for example.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.406
So, you know, I have people
ready and available who want

28:29.408 --> 28:30.540
These products.

28:30.609 --> 28:32.809
I'm ready to deliver them.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.978
What do you mean by they were
picked up by indigo?

28:35.981 --> 28:36.880
Well, I have an agreement with
indigo...

28:36.882 --> 28:38.215
[vincenzo] right.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.217
...So a po is coming for my be
kind all the time calendar...

28:40.285 --> 28:41.084
[vincenzo] right.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.886
...As well as the mindset
magnets.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.288
For how many?

28:44.290 --> 28:47.257
Well, the po is on its way,
but it'll be in-store and online

28:47.325 --> 28:49.326
Several hundred units.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.963
-What's your sales right now?
-So in 2017, we launched.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.732
That was $17,000 in sales.

28:55.801 --> 28:57.701
In 2018, it was $37,000.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.237
2019, $39,000.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.207
And then last year was the first
year where our sales went down

29:04.276 --> 29:06.410
Instead of up, so we did $23,000
last year.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.380
You would have thought that your
sales would have gone up last

29:10.448 --> 29:11.281
Year through covid.

29:11.349 --> 29:12.349
Why did they go down?

29:12.417 --> 29:15.051
So, it was an interesting time
for sure.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.320
There's a lot of factors.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.856
The main one for me was just a
shift in focus.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.594
Homeschooling two young kids,
including a kindergartener

29:24.663 --> 29:26.296
And a grade 2,
takes a lot of effort.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.799
Many women have had to make
difficult choices.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.034
Yeah, they've had to be
everything at home suddenly.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.569
Yeah, everything all the time.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.938
And for me, the choice with the
business was to focus on

29:35.007 --> 29:37.040
Product development last year.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.075
And how much do each of these
sell for?

29:39.144 --> 29:40.911
So the retail price of the
calendar is $75.

29:42.047 --> 29:43.814
-Oh my goodness.
-Yeah, it's a high-cost item.

29:43.882 --> 29:45.916
That is a very expensive
calendar.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.517
-The retail price?
-[vincenzo] wow.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.754
Plus $5 of shipping.

29:50.756 --> 29:53.156
Okay, maran, it is a sticky
piece of paper

29:53.225 --> 29:54.357
With some stickers.

29:54.426 --> 29:55.826
$75?

29:55.828 --> 29:57.627
[maran] yeah, it's a
premium-priced product,

29:57.696 --> 29:59.429
And there's a lot of things that
can justify that.

29:59.497 --> 30:00.797
That is a word for it.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.366
It is a lot of money, and that's
why I'm here.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.636
And if I can help get--if I can
partner with you guys

30:06.639 --> 30:07.838
For mentorship and get those
costs down--

30:07.906 --> 30:08.905
But what's the cost?

30:08.908 --> 30:10.107
What is the cost?

30:10.175 --> 30:11.775
[maran] cost of the product to
manufacture, the calendars,

30:11.844 --> 30:13.643
It's $17.80.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.278
-Oh my goodness.
-Whoa!

30:15.347 --> 30:18.248
[maran] my cost landed, once
it's in the customer's hands,

30:18.316 --> 30:20.617
Is about $33.93.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.386
That is unbelievably high cost.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.290
This came from a need that I
have, as well as for my kids.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.893
You have a great intention,
but it's not accessible.

30:29.961 --> 30:33.296
Like, we wanna teach every kid
on the planet to be thoughtful

30:33.365 --> 30:34.498
And mindful and kind, right?

30:35.467 --> 30:40.804
Like, a $75 piece of paper is
really just afforded to very,

30:40.872 --> 30:42.005
Very rich people.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.941
I wanted to make something
turnkey that families could use.

30:45.010 --> 30:45.909
They could open a box.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.077
They didn't have to think about
it.

30:47.145 --> 30:48.345
They didn't have to go to
pinterest.

30:48.413 --> 30:49.779
They didn't have to take time--

30:49.848 --> 30:52.415
[manjit] maran, we all think
that the product is great,

30:52.484 --> 30:54.651
But it's the business aspect
that we're having problems with.

30:54.719 --> 30:57.855
Low sales, high cost.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.156
There's a lot of challenges
here.

31:01.226 --> 31:05.161
I'm here not just for the
financial investment,

31:05.164 --> 31:06.296
But I'm here for mentorship.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.032
And getting those costs down is
one of the first things

31:09.100 --> 31:10.667
That I'm aiming to do.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.701
But you're a smart person.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.270
Why haven't you hired an agent
or consultant?

31:14.173 --> 31:16.339
Somebody could help you very
quickly over the last

31:16.408 --> 31:17.741
Four years.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.477
You know, I will admit, I have
done all of these things myself.

and sourcing I've done myself.

costs, we need to see

37:58.810 --> 38:00.310
[vincenzo] it's very cool.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.846
[dianne]...To a sleeper bunkie,
which costs about $6,000.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.282

here, and it's really nice

38:05.350 --> 38:07.583

-[wes] yeah, it is actually.

38:14.058 --> 38:15.258

38:16.595 --> 38:19.295

38:19.364 --> 38:20.697

38:23.201 --> 38:26.102
You mentioned the ronald
mcdonald house and its impact.

38:26.170 --> 38:27.304
What's the story there?

38:28.940 --> 38:30.139
Can you share that with us?

38:30.208 --> 38:33.009
Yeah, so--I promise there's a
happy ending to the story,

38:33.077 --> 38:33.943
Before we get into it, so--

38:34.011 --> 38:34.877
Okay.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.346
Because you know I cry easily,
right?

38:36.348 --> 38:38.748
So we've always had a dream of
having a large family,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.483
And so as I said, when we had
our first daughter,

38:40.552 --> 38:43.619
We built our first bunkie.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.621
And everything went great.

38:45.690 --> 38:46.823
A couple years passed,
we thought,

38:46.891 --> 38:48.024
"let's try for another kid."

38:48.960 --> 38:52.562
And we ended up losing two
babies around the ten-week mark.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.897
And then we had our second
daughter hope and...

38:54.966 --> 38:56.966
Love the name.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.968
[david]...A few years went by,
we started trying again for baby

38:58.970 --> 39:03.172
Number three, and around the
16-, 17-week mark, where we

39:03.175 --> 39:05.141
Thought we were out of the
woods, we ended up losing a baby

39:05.210 --> 39:09.011
On new year's day, 2018,
and we kinda gathered

39:09.080 --> 39:10.313
Our courage again.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.449
In July of that year, we lost
baby number four.

39:15.120 --> 39:19.489
And...With the support of our
friends and our family,

39:19.557 --> 39:21.191
We started praying how can we
turn what we've gone through

39:21.259 --> 39:22.458
Into something good?

39:22.527 --> 39:23.659
[manjit] right.

39:23.728 --> 39:25.395
[david] and so we realized like
having the bunkie on our

39:25.397 --> 39:29.165
Property was more than just a
cool bunkie and a cool-looking

39:29.233 --> 39:32.802
Thing, it was a bridge for our
families who live many hours

39:32.871 --> 39:35.505
Away to come and stay with us
and be near us when we were

39:35.573 --> 39:37.774
Going through what was a very
tough time.

39:39.211 --> 39:43.012
And so, we realized that we had
built our little ronald mcdonald

39:43.014 --> 39:45.481
House right on our hill,
and we hadn't even realized it.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.918
The goal is whenever we sell a
bunkie, we'll donate a night's

39:48.986 --> 39:51.854
Stay to a family that is going
through a crisis

39:51.923 --> 39:52.955
And that can really
use their support.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.891
Ronald mcdonald house,
their mission is keeping

39:54.959 --> 39:56.426

39:56.494 --> 39:58.895
It's fantastic that you've
persevered and made a social

39:58.963 --> 40:01.431

talk about the business.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.434

-[manjit] okay.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.904

-[manjit] okay.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.806
-And we basically broke even.
-[manjit] okay.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.476
2019, we did $820,000 in sales.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.379
And that's when you started
doing it full time?

40:16.447 --> 40:18.080
-[kerry] mm hmm.
-[manjit] okay.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.749
[kerry] we had a net profit of
about $140,000.

40:21.553 --> 40:24.254
2020, we did $2.48 million in
sales.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.588
Oh, wow.

40:25.656 --> 40:27.557
We did about $400,000 net
profit.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.861
Year to date, we're at $5.26
million in sales.

40:33.130 --> 40:34.631
We'll finish the year at $7
million.

40:36.367 --> 40:40.603
We'll have a gross profit margin
of approximately 37%

40:40.672 --> 40:42.672
And a net profit of about
$1.25 million.

40:43.674 --> 40:44.540

40:54.819 --> 40:56.352
[arlene] what's the million
dollars for?

40:57.022 --> 40:59.522
The million is we want to bring
this in-house.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.259
We want to have our own factory,
have our own control.

41:03.327 --> 41:05.061
But why aren't you just
borrowing the money?

41:05.129 --> 41:07.764
Because you have the ability to
borrow the money.

41:07.832 --> 41:09.665
