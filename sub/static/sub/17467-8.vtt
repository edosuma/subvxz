00:01.436 --> 00:04.003
Previously onMom...You guys hear that?

00:04.046 --> 00:05.701
Jill'’s figured out what's
missing in her life.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.050
Great. What is it?

00:07.094 --> 00:08.225
I need to have a baby.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.487
Don'’t get me wrong.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.185
I love her,
but Jill is the last person

00:11.228 --> 00:12.751
in the world
who should be having a baby.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.014
So what'’s the plan?

00:14.057 --> 00:15.580
I don'’t know.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.800
Figure out a way to talk her
out of this baby craziness.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.671
I will tell her
how painful it was

00:19.715 --> 00:21.282
when you came out
of me feet-first.

00:21.325 --> 00:24.415
I came out feet-first
so I could run.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.808
Jill Kendall?

00:25.851 --> 00:28.245
Jill, don'’t do this.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.769
Being a parent is hard,
it'’s exhausting,

00:30.813 --> 00:32.597
and you are not
cut out for it.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.689
I never want to talk
to you again.

00:40.083 --> 00:43.304
I'’m not sure why we're buying
Jill a birthday present.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.870
She'’s barely
speaking to me.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.394
Well, that'’s what happens
when you tell someone

00:46.437 --> 00:48.570
they'’re not fit to reproduce.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.528
Do youthink it'’s a good
idea for her to have a baby?

00:50.572 --> 00:52.965
God, no. I was gonna wait
till she actually has a kid

00:53.009 --> 00:55.838
and then talk about her behind
her back, like a true friend.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.623
Let'’s just find something
for under a hundred bucks

00:58.667 --> 01:01.017
so I can go to
work and earn 75.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.149
What about these gloves?

01:02.192 --> 01:04.412
We can buy one.

01:04.455 --> 01:05.500
[sighs]

01:05.543 --> 01:07.719
Okay, let'’s spread out. Hey.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.199
If you see something nice,
damage it.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.853
Maybe we'’ll get a break.
[clicks tongue]

01:18.861 --> 01:20.167
[humming softly]

01:20.210 --> 01:21.516
May I help you with something?

01:21.559 --> 01:23.213
I'’m just browsing.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.128
Yeah, I sensed that.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.522
Kind of a lot to spend

01:27.565 --> 01:30.046
on a piece of plastic with
a fancy name on the side.

01:30.090 --> 01:34.094
Those are hand-carved tortoise
shell with 18-karat gold hinges.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.139
Oh. Didn'’t know that.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.706
Why would you?

01:39.490 --> 01:40.883
Score!

01:40.926 --> 01:42.537
Really? It'’s kind of ugly.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.973
It'’s on sale-- 80 bucks.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.583
We would like
to purchase this.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.585
I'’ll ring it up.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.674
If you'’re still interested
in sunglasses,

01:49.718 --> 01:51.937
there'’s a Walgreens
down the street.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.855
The sad thing is, we doneed
to go to Walgreens.

01:59.336 --> 02:02.687
I'’ll buy her a tube
of bitch cream.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.560
Will that be cash
or credit card?

02:05.603 --> 02:07.692
Well, I'’ve got
eight credit cards.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.912
Let'’s spin the wheel
and see which one'’s good.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.788
Meet you at the car, Mom.

02:16.832 --> 02:17.963
Okay.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.575
Whew! Blockbuster.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.142
You don'’t see these
anymore, do you?

02:24.840 --> 02:27.059
Blink if you'’re here
against your will.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.890
♪

02:46.731 --> 02:48.559
Can you believe that
saleswoman? [scoffs]

02:48.603 --> 02:50.126
Acts like she'’s royalty,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.215
but you know she'’s eating
a Blimpie for lunch.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.695
Bet she was in a bunch

02:53.738 --> 02:55.740
of those little kid
beauty pageants and never won.

02:55.784 --> 02:56.698
[chuckles]

03:00.180 --> 03:01.485
Are those new?

03:01.529 --> 03:03.661
These? No.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.097
Are you sure?

03:05.141 --> 03:06.534
I'’ve never seen 'em.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.057
Yeah, had '’em a while.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.233
Just been out of the rotation.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.669
You'’re gonna stick
with that story,

03:11.713 --> 03:13.280
even with the price tag
still on '’em?

03:13.323 --> 03:14.759
What?

03:14.803 --> 03:18.241
Oh. Uh... Huh.

03:18.285 --> 03:22.463
If you were gonna shoplift, you
could'’ve taken the scarf, too.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.639
I just hated that woman so much.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.772
She treated me like white trash
who couldn'’t afford nice things.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.339
You are, and you can'’t.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.472
I know!

03:31.515 --> 03:33.343
They are beautiful.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.867
You look like
a movie star.

03:35.911 --> 03:39.480
Especially the ones who
go crazy and steal stuff.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.090
It'’s just not fair.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.179
I work my ass off, I'’m sober,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.834
I give a penny way more
than I take a penny,

03:45.877 --> 03:47.488
and what do I get?

03:47.531 --> 03:50.317
Drugstore sunglasses
that aren'’t even polarized.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.667
What does that mean
exactly-- "polarized"?

03:52.710 --> 03:54.886
I don'’t know,
but I deserve polarized!

03:54.930 --> 03:56.671
Save it for Judge Judy.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.716
Just drive.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.371
Your outstanding warrant
is in Nevada, right?

04:01.415 --> 04:03.721
I said drive!

04:05.375 --> 04:06.985
What?

04:07.029 --> 04:08.509
Nothing.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.032
You just look so small

04:10.075 --> 04:12.252
from up here on the
moral high ground.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.517
This one'’s from me.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.041
Oh, thank you,
Marjorie.

04:20.172 --> 04:23.132
Oh! A book!

04:23.175 --> 04:26.004
With no words in it.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.006
That'’s what
the pen is for.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.660
Writing in a journal--

04:29.704 --> 04:32.141
it helps you process your
thoughts and feelings.

04:32.184 --> 04:36.058
Fun!

04:36.101 --> 04:38.365
In fact, I'’m gonna write that.

04:38.408 --> 04:41.455
"This... is... fun."

04:42.543 --> 04:44.327
Exclamation point!

04:45.807 --> 04:48.157
Here'’s a gift
that isn'’t like homework.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.201
From me

04:49.245 --> 04:50.333
and Christy.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.682
Oh, thanks, Bonnie.

04:51.726 --> 04:52.901
[flatly]:
Christy.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.338
Come on. I said I'’m sorry.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.166
I'’m sure you'll be
a great mother.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.908
This is my birthday, Christy.
Let'’s not make this about you.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.303
Oh!

05:03.346 --> 05:06.915
That is a lot of color!

05:07.916 --> 05:09.352
Thanks, Bonnie.

05:09.396 --> 05:12.224
[flatly]:
Christy.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.792
I'’m starting to feel really
bad about my gift card.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.142
Oh, don'’t.
I'’m sure I'll love it.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.800
[gasps]
Oh, Wendy, thank you!

05:22.844 --> 05:23.758
Do you like it?

05:23.801 --> 05:25.368
I do.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.892
I'’ve always wanted
to go to a Best Buy.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.156
Now I guess I have to.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.725
Thanks, everybody.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.554
The best gift is having
you guys in my life.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.208
[flatly]:
And you, Christy.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.601
[sighs]

05:40.644 --> 05:42.167
Those new sunglasses?

05:42.211 --> 05:44.866
Indeed they are,
and they come with a story.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.478
What'’s the story?

05:48.522 --> 05:50.611
I thought I lost '’em,
then I found '’em.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.047
Not much of a story.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.831
Nobody gets killed,
nobody gets laid.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.400
Those are Prada.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.141
No, they'’re not.
They'’re knockoffs.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.708
Knockoffs are everything else
you'’re wearing.

06:00.751 --> 06:02.318
Those babies are Prada.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.668
Do me a favor. Just go back
to freezing me out.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.583
Whatever do you mean?

06:06.627 --> 06:08.629
What are you writing?
Is that about me?

06:08.672 --> 06:10.239
No.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.849
"Hateful" has one "L."

06:16.114 --> 06:17.638
Why are you turning here?

06:17.681 --> 06:19.074
Adam'’s coming over later.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.468
I'’m gonna get
him some beer.

06:21.511 --> 06:25.385
You want to wait in the car or
come in and steal something?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.256
A lot of choices by
the cash register.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.867
Slim Jims, couple of
freckled bananas.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.348
How long are you gonna roast me
on this thing?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.045
Hard to say.
It'’s kind of like gum.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.960
You never know
when it'’s gonna lose its flavor.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.180
Hey, you can steal gum.

06:38.223 --> 06:41.792
Hilarious.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.577
You'’re in a handicap spot.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.274
No problem.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.452
What'’s that?
Is that Adam'’s thingie?

06:49.496 --> 06:53.151
Of course not. I borrowed his,
copied it at Kinko'’s, and voila.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.110
It'’s laminated.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.808
Yeah, I do good work.

06:57.852 --> 07:01.203
So that'’s a counterfeit
handicap placard?

07:01.246 --> 07:03.771
Keep your voice down.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.250
How could you do this?

07:05.294 --> 07:07.339
I am running an errand
for a handicapped person.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.994
So, therefore, placard
privileges transfer to me.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.474
No, they don'’t.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.693
Well, they should.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.477
Or are you in favor
of a disabled person

07:14.521 --> 07:16.305
getting his beer at a slower
rate than other people?

07:16.348 --> 07:17.959
Because if so,
[scoffs] wow.

07:18.002 --> 07:18.916
[scoffs]

07:25.270 --> 07:27.229
[siren whoops]

07:30.275 --> 07:31.799
Hold it right there, please.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.670
Me?

07:33.714 --> 07:35.324
Hi there.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.326
You realize
you'’re in a handicap spot?

07:37.369 --> 07:40.111
Yes, I am.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.157
And as you can see,
I have a placard.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.680
That issued to you?

07:43.724 --> 07:45.290
Well, yes, of course.

07:45.334 --> 07:48.511
I had... both my
hips replaced.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.688
Still working
out the kinks.

07:51.732 --> 07:54.256
Mommy, do the limp again!

07:55.562 --> 07:57.172
I need to see your I.D.

07:57.215 --> 07:59.348
How about you
show me your I.D.?

07:59.391 --> 08:02.046
'’Cause all I'm seeing are some
skin-tight shorts and a bicycle.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.439
For all I know,
you could be

08:03.483 --> 08:05.833
on your way to a
bachelorette party.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.965
I mean, you'’re very
handsome. It'’s possible.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.185
Just show me your license
and registration.

08:10.228 --> 08:14.363
Okay, look... it'’s my
boyfriend'’s placard.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.886
I don'’t see a boyfriend.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.802
You do not because
he is at home,

08:18.846 --> 08:21.979
confined to his wheelchair,
just waiting for the one thing

08:22.023 --> 08:25.635
that helps him get through his
lonely, handicapped day: beer.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.985
It'’s probably hard
for you to imagine

08:28.029 --> 08:30.640
with your
perfectly-muscled legs.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.076
I'’m gonna have to cite you.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.339
Ah, son of a bitch.
How about this?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.385
I just move my car
to another spot,

08:36.428 --> 08:38.299
and we can file this one
under "lesson learned."

08:38.342 --> 08:39.301
Too late, ma'’am.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.910
Officer, if you put me

08:40.955 --> 08:42.390
in the witness protection
program,

08:42.433 --> 08:44.087
I'’ll tell you everything!

08:44.131 --> 08:46.090
Pipe down, sunglasses!

08:47.962 --> 08:50.442
How about I just jump
in my car and drive off?

08:50.486 --> 08:52.444
You think you can catch me
on your little Schwinn?

08:52.488 --> 08:54.403
Two Baker 21,
requesting backup.

08:56.361 --> 08:59.190
He'’s bluffing, Mom! Run for it!

08:59.234 --> 09:00.801
Oh, come on!

09:00.844 --> 09:03.543
A handicapped boyfriend and
a mentally ill daughter?

09:03.586 --> 09:05.022
Have some compassion!

09:12.464 --> 09:14.858
You know what?
I'’m not paying this ticket.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.381
I'’m gonna take it to court.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.992
Good for you.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.603
You have every right
to pretend to be handicapped.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.170
No, you don'’t get it.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.259
This is a First Amendment issue.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.477
Remind me.

09:25.521 --> 09:26.783
You know, First Amendment--

09:26.827 --> 09:28.742
the one that says
I can do whatever I want.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.482
Are you insane?

09:30.526 --> 09:33.485
If I can get a doctor
to so testify, then yes.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.704
[knock on door]

09:34.748 --> 09:36.488
That'’s Adam.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.969
Do not say a word about this.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.754
Really?
You'’re not gonna tell him?

09:40.797 --> 09:42.625
What about your honest
and open relationship

09:42.669 --> 09:44.453
you'’re always bragging about?

09:44.496 --> 09:47.151
That doesn'’t really serve
my interests right now, does it?

09:49.414 --> 09:50.415
Hello!

09:50.459 --> 09:52.243
Hey.
[chuckles] Mmm.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.244
Mmm.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.942
Come on in,
you handsome devil.

09:54.985 --> 09:55.943
Hey, Adam.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.422
Hi, Christy.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.815
So, what'’s the
plan tonight?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.295
We gonna eat here,
go out for a bite?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.166
You pick.
Whatever makes you happy.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.690
Really? Okay.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.431
Um, let'’s order in pizza
and watch some football.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.955
All right,
but only if you promise

10:07.998 --> 10:10.827
to let me ride you
like a pony during halftime.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.569
Uh, uh, Bonnie...

10:13.613 --> 10:17.268
Don'’t worry about me;
I'’m dead inside.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.054
Let me get you a beer
and something to snack on.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.710
Okay, what'’s going on with her?

10:23.753 --> 10:25.494
Excuse me?

10:25.537 --> 10:26.930
The last time she was this nice

10:26.974 --> 10:30.194
was right after she gave me
that... haircut.

10:30.238 --> 10:34.024
Hey, I warned you,
but you were in love.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.679
So what did she do now?

10:36.723 --> 10:39.247
I don'’t think she did anything,
but if you'’re concerned,

10:39.290 --> 10:41.075
maybe you should
press her on it.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.774
What you talking about?

10:44.818 --> 10:47.734
Adam seems to think
something'’s going on with you.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.649
[sighs] Thank you, Christy.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.347
I was gonna wait
till after halftime.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.829
There'’s nothing
going on with me.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.657
Drink your beer.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.181
Sip it slow;
it was very expensive.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.534
All right, what'’s the deal?

11:05.577 --> 11:07.623
If you must know,

11:07.667 --> 11:10.713
when I went to pick up the beer,
I got a ticket-- no biggie.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.410
Oh. Bummer. What for?

11:12.454 --> 11:16.501
Just a parking ticket, you know,
for the way in which I parked.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.851
[snorts]

11:19.591 --> 11:21.768
What'’s [snorts] mean?

11:21.811 --> 11:24.640
Sorry, a lot of blow
went up here.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.207
Still paying the price.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.559
Come on, somebody tell me.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.692
Fine. I-I was in
a little bit of a hurry

11:32.735 --> 11:36.391
to get you your beer,
so I parked in a handicap spot.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.307
Wow. That is not cool.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.178
Agreed. Which is why
I only use it

11:41.222 --> 11:42.919
when I'’m doing something
for you.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.573
Use what?

11:47.010 --> 11:49.273
Uh... Okay. Okay.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.543
You know that I'’m a big fan
of arts and crafts.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.592
Well, a while back,

12:03.635 --> 12:07.596
I got an idea for a project,
which now, in hindsight,

12:07.639 --> 12:11.165
might have been
morally questionable.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.862
Or as the cop said,
"despicable."

12:15.735 --> 12:16.953
Oh, just get to it.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.913
I made a copy
of your handicap parking placard

12:19.956 --> 12:22.872
and laminated it
so it'’d look official.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.700
[laughs]:
I...

12:24.744 --> 12:26.223
You got to be kidding me.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.486
She'’s not. Show him the limp.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.316
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:33.491 --> 12:36.538
Here'’s the problem.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.801
I love...

12:38.845 --> 12:40.585
to laminate things.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.806
Always have.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.331
Registration, Social Security
card, you name it.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.811
Call me crazy,

12:48.855 --> 12:51.292
but once a document
is covered in plastic,

12:51.335 --> 12:53.424
it'’s just better.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.252
This is not a joke, Bonnie.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.515
I don'’t even
use that thing.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.039
It'’s for people
who really need it.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.780
Well, I know that, but...No, no, no.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.130
I-I'’m serious. I'm lucky,
I can still get around,

13:03.173 --> 13:06.524
but there are people
in such bad shape,

13:06.568 --> 13:09.963
going to the store
is their entire day.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.271
That spot changes everything.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.143
I understand.Do you?

13:16.186 --> 13:19.059
Because an able-bodied person
parking in a handicap spot

13:19.102 --> 13:21.801
is kind of the definition
of "don'’t understand."

13:23.672 --> 13:26.240
Christy stole sunglasses!
She just took '’em!

13:27.415 --> 13:28.372
Seriously?

13:28.416 --> 13:30.940
The saleslady
was mean to me!

13:30.984 --> 13:33.638
Oh, my God, who are you people?!

13:35.553 --> 13:36.816
Believe it or not,

13:36.859 --> 13:39.557
better versions
of who we used to be.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.865
Christy, can I talk to your mom
alone for a minute, please?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.780
Yeah, sure.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.521
I'’ve seen what I came to see.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.570
Do we really need to talk?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.834
Because I-I think I get it now.

13:54.877 --> 13:55.965
Sit down.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.054
Not there.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.759
I hope you'’re happy. Adam left.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.458
I'’m sorry. I didn't think
it would go that far.

14:10.501 --> 14:13.853
Says he has grave concerns
about my character.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.333
I haven'’t heard that
since kindergarten.

14:16.377 --> 14:20.772
Well, I'’m sure he'll cool down
and you guys'’ll work it out.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.383
I hope so.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.775
Where you going?

14:23.819 --> 14:25.255
I'’m too upset
to go to sleep.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.257
Good.

14:27.301 --> 14:30.652
You know what, you have
no right to sleep either.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.480
I have confessed
my so-called crime

14:32.523 --> 14:34.569
and have been punished for it,
whereas you don'’t even

14:34.612 --> 14:36.701
have the balls to admit
you did something wrong.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.312
[mockingly]:
"I'’m a good person.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.228
She was mean to me.
I give a penny."

14:41.271 --> 14:42.664
Oh, yeah, how about you?

14:42.707 --> 14:44.840
[mockingly]:
"I love to laminate things,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.798
always have."

14:58.854 --> 14:59.768
[sighs]

15:04.294 --> 15:05.600
[gasps]

15:11.519 --> 15:14.043
Hi. I don'’t know
if you remember me.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.132
I was in yesterday with my mom.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.134
We bought that scarf.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.614
Oh, sure, Walgreens.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.660
That scarf was a sale item,

15:22.704 --> 15:24.532
so I'’m sorry,
you can'’t return it.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.534
No, I don'’t want to return it.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.579
The reason I'’m here
is because...

15:28.623 --> 15:29.841
[phone rings]

15:29.885 --> 15:32.540
Sugar Magnolia.
Can I help you?

15:32.583 --> 15:35.673
Oh, hello,
Mrs. Crawford.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.371
No, I'’m not busy.

15:37.414 --> 15:40.069
A little busy.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.332
Yeah, your shoes
came in this morning.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.204
Oh, they'’re gorgeous.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.162
Excuse me, you were helping me.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.817
Yes, and now
I'’m helping Mrs. Crawford.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.037
Yes, I'’m here
till 6:00.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.649
In fact, I'’ll pull some
other new items that came in.

15:54.692 --> 15:57.043
Oh, there'’s
an adorable...

16:02.222 --> 16:04.224
Would anyone else like to share?

16:04.267 --> 16:06.530
I'’ll go.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.924
I'’m Marjorie,
and I'’m an alcoholic.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.665
ALL:
Hi, Marjorie.

16:10.708 --> 16:14.974
[sighs] I'’m not feeling very
good about myself right now.

16:15.017 --> 16:18.412
Last night, my husband and I
were supposed to have dinner

16:18.455 --> 16:21.023
with his family, which...

16:21.067 --> 16:23.417
I don'’t know how to describe it.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.896
Uch.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.553
Anyway, just as we
were about to leave,

16:29.597 --> 16:32.339
I told Victor
that I had an AA emergency

16:32.382 --> 16:34.906
and I had to go meet
with one of my sponsees.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.693
So I lied to
my husband.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.000
And yeah, maybe it was
a small, one-time thing,

16:41.043 --> 16:43.524
but, uh, I believe
everything we do

16:43.567 --> 16:47.049
brings us either closer
or further away from a drink.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.749
And this one brought me closer.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.708
So I need to fix it.

16:57.973 --> 17:01.281
You know, I sit here
and listen to your crap!

17:01.324 --> 17:02.673
[mouths]

17:06.199 --> 17:08.679
Sorry I'’m late. I-I couldn't
find a parking spot.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.421
I mean, there was one,
but... not for me.

17:12.988 --> 17:13.989
Doesn'’t matter.

17:14.032 --> 17:17.252
Happy to walk,
grateful to walk.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.907
So, I'’m here.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.824
What couldn'’t you tell me
on the phone?

17:22.867 --> 17:25.957
I wanted to be looking
in your eyes when I say...

17:26.001 --> 17:27.523
Move it along, Bonnie.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.006
I understand
what I did was wrong.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.486
And I'’m not gonna

17:32.529 --> 17:34.575
try to justify it
by telling you I was raised

17:34.618 --> 17:37.534
in the foster system with no one
to teach me the difference

17:37.578 --> 17:40.407
between right and wrong,
or that I ran away

17:40.450 --> 17:42.409
when I was 13,
lived on the streets,

17:42.452 --> 17:44.324
eating only what I could steal,

17:44.367 --> 17:46.630
until I got pregnant
and ended up sleeping in my car.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.589
Well, it wasn'’t my car,
it was acar.

17:48.632 --> 17:49.764
Bonnie,

17:49.807 --> 17:51.896
if you'’re trying to apologize,

17:51.940 --> 17:53.898
just apologize.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.857
Believe it or not, I am trying.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.251
This is the sewage
that comes out.

18:00.296 --> 18:04.822
Probably because of
the many hardships I'’ve faced.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.089
[groans softly]

18:11.612 --> 18:13.918
Yep, me again.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.096
Okay, here it is.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.663
I stole a pair of sunglasses,
expensive ones.

18:19.707 --> 18:23.232
But I feel bad about it,
so I'’m bringing them back.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.888
You stole these?

18:26.931 --> 18:28.368
I did.

18:28.411 --> 18:29.847
And these gloves.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.722
You played a role,
but I take full responsibility.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.071
And I'’m sorry.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.160
Unbelievable.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.207
Yep, not my finest moment.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.687
Moments.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.646
I don'’t know what to say.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.474
I mean, people shoplift
all the time,

18:47.517 --> 18:50.999
but no one'’s actually ever
come back to apologize.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.044
That took a lot of courage.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.917
Well, yeah, it kind of did.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.311
But I'’m trying to live my life
more honestly,

18:58.354 --> 19:00.269
'’cause I don't
want to drink again.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.966
Good for you.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.925
But I still
have to call the police.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.187
Wait, what? No!

19:05.231 --> 19:06.623
I came back here
to make amends and...

19:07.972 --> 19:10.061
Aw, screw it!
Try and catch me!

19:16.807 --> 19:18.461
Just hope you can
forgive me so someday we can

19:18.505 --> 19:22.204
laugh about it, like we do about
that bad haircut I gave you.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.641
That was funny to you?

19:24.685 --> 19:27.296
No, not at all.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.126
Please tell me
how I can make it up to you.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.432
I don'’t know, Bonnie.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.868
There'’s got to be something.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.393
Do you need anything laminated?

19:37.437 --> 19:38.525
[chuckling]

19:43.443 --> 19:45.445
Was that Christy?Yeah. So, we good?
