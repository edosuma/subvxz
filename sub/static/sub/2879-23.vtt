WEBVTT

00:02.858 --> 00:04.313
<u>Burbank Airport, please.</u>

00:04.314 --> 00:05.730
Vegas, here we come!

00:05.732 --> 00:06.731
No husbands,

00:06.733 --> 00:08.617
no boyfriends, no rules.

00:08.619 --> 00:10.018
No rules?

00:10.020 --> 00:12.153
We're not gonna get drunk
and have a six-way

00:12.155 --> 00:14.406
with the Blue Man Group, are we?

00:14.408 --> 00:16.107
No.

00:16.109 --> 00:17.525
So there are some rules.

00:17.527 --> 00:18.610
Fine.

00:18.612 --> 00:21.913
No husbands, no boyfriends,
some rules.

00:21.915 --> 00:22.697
Thank you.

00:22.699 --> 00:25.700
Vegas!

00:25.702 --> 00:28.787
The ladies are away,
the boys will play.

00:28.789 --> 00:30.071
Anything can happen.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.740
It's gonna get crazy.

00:31.742 --> 00:33.441
Dungeons & Dragons!

00:35.094 --> 00:36.344
I got a brand-new bikini,

00:36.346 --> 00:40.081
so drinks at the pool
are on these.

00:40.083 --> 00:43.435
I got a sexy new tube top
that says "Come hither"

00:43.437 --> 00:47.255
and a can of pepper spray
that says "Close enough, Jack."

00:47.257 --> 00:49.941
I got some old underwear
I'm gonna throw on stage

00:49.943 --> 00:52.394
at the Garth Brooks concert.

00:52.396 --> 00:54.696
I'm sorry, why old?

00:54.698 --> 00:56.764
'Cause last time I saw him,
I threw new ones

00:56.766 --> 00:58.116
and it got me nothing.

00:59.485 --> 01:01.620
I've got a brand-new
seven piece set

01:01.622 --> 01:03.238
of polyhedral dice.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.074
Hello, new dice smell.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.609
I've got my helm
of lordly might,

01:08.611 --> 01:10.962
my boots of speed,
and if things get too exciting,

01:10.964 --> 01:13.614
my inhaler of asthma.

01:13.616 --> 01:16.635
I got my new bloodthirsty
savage warrior

01:16.637 --> 01:19.454
who will lay waste to all
who stand before him.

01:19.456 --> 01:21.172
And I had a sensible salad
for lunch,

01:21.174 --> 01:23.291
so I can eat
all the pizza I want.

01:23.293 --> 01:25.060
Come on, are we
gonna sit around

01:25.062 --> 01:26.794
chatting like a bunch
of teenage girls,

01:26.796 --> 01:29.481
or are we gonna play D & D
like a bunch of teenage boys

01:29.483 --> 01:32.133
who are never gonna have sex
with those teenage girls?!

01:33.802 --> 01:36.154
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!

01:36.156 --> 01:38.023

02:14.270 --> 02:16.455
I'm actually glad
Lucy had to work tonight.

02:16.457 --> 02:19.091
Saved me the awkward
conversation about how I was

02:19.093 --> 02:21.877
gonna be hanging with my bros.

02:21.879 --> 02:24.513
Isn't every conversation
you two have awkward?

02:24.515 --> 02:25.931
Eh?

02:25.933 --> 02:27.215
Painfully so.

02:27.217 --> 02:29.684
We have this rule on the phone
that if no one talks

02:29.686 --> 02:32.220
for three minutes,
you can just hang up.

02:33.756 --> 02:35.974
So into her.

02:35.976 --> 02:38.143
Ready whenever
you guys are.

02:38.145 --> 02:40.095
Yeah, yeah, we'll
be right there.

02:40.097 --> 02:41.329
Yeah, Leonard...
Yeah?

02:41.331 --> 02:42.647
I'm not sure how I feel

02:42.649 --> 02:45.901
about Howard being
dungeon master instead of you.

02:45.903 --> 02:46.935
Oh, that's nice.

02:46.937 --> 02:49.121
But relax,
sometimes change is good.

02:49.123 --> 02:51.323
Uh, you were worried
about Zachary Quinto

02:51.325 --> 02:53.742
being the new Spock,
but you wound up liking him.

02:53.744 --> 02:54.776
Oh, please.

02:54.778 --> 02:56.411
Every time the topic
of change comes up,

02:56.413 --> 02:58.163
you throw Zachary
Quinto in my face.

02:59.132 --> 03:00.949
I'm upset the mailman
has a new haircut:

03:00.951 --> 03:02.334
Zachary Quinto.

03:02.336 --> 03:04.252
I'm upset that daylight
saving time started:

03:04.254 --> 03:05.670
Zachary Quinto.

03:05.672 --> 03:07.956
I'm upset daylight saving time
ended: Zachary Quinto.

03:07.958 --> 03:09.141
I'm saying this

03:09.143 --> 03:10.926
for the last time:
Zachary Quinto was

03:10.928 --> 03:12.811
a weird, wonderful,
unrepeatable event.

03:12.813 --> 03:14.763
So stop using
him against me.

03:15.598 --> 03:17.849
Okay, here we go.

03:17.851 --> 03:20.018
You find yourselves in

03:20.020 --> 03:22.521
an overgrown old forest.

03:22.523 --> 03:25.857
Before you is a <i>giant</i> oak tree

03:25.859 --> 03:30.028
with a face on it that looks
a lot like Nicolas Cage.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.581
He says,

03:32.583 --> 03:35.750
"Travel with caution.

03:37.003 --> 03:40.755
"These woods are home
to the bones

03:40.757 --> 03:42.657
"of many a fallen...

03:42.659 --> 03:44.876
hero!"

03:47.597 --> 03:51.516
See, Howard's just as good
a dungeon master as I am.

03:51.518 --> 03:52.767
As good?

03:52.769 --> 03:55.387
You just got pantsed
in the schoolyard, four-eyes.

03:55.389 --> 03:57.439
Hey, come on, guys, focus.

03:57.441 --> 03:59.374
Um, uh...

03:59.376 --> 04:02.144
Oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree,

04:02.146 --> 04:03.528
we thank you
for your warning,

04:03.530 --> 04:05.480
but we are brave warriors,

04:05.482 --> 04:08.817
and nothing short of death
will keep us from our goal.

04:12.705 --> 04:14.406
Oh, Lucy's free after all.

04:14.408 --> 04:16.158
See ya.

04:17.026 --> 04:18.660
Hey, hey, hey,
you can't leave.

04:18.661 --> 04:19.845
We just started.

04:19.846 --> 04:21.379
You're right,
I should finish the game.

04:21.380 --> 04:24.466
I take my plus-one long sword,
stab myself in the face with it.

04:24.468 --> 04:26.501
I'm dead, I've got
a date with a girl.

04:26.503 --> 04:28.136
Bye.

04:29.889 --> 04:30.922
We'll be fine, watch.

04:30.924 --> 04:33.758
Suddenly, a spectral shape

04:33.760 --> 04:37.512
rises from Koothrappali's
bloody corpse, and says,

04:37.514 --> 04:39.064
"Don't worry, buddies,

04:39.066 --> 04:41.066
"Ghost Raj will help

04:41.068 --> 04:42.934
guide you through the forest."

04:42.936 --> 04:45.386
"Well, I'm just

04:45.388 --> 04:47.822
"a tree, but if I were you,
I'd listen to your

04:47.824 --> 04:49.691
ghost friend!"

04:53.079 --> 04:56.031
Go on, give him
your lunch money.

05:00.169 --> 05:03.121
I'm very happy you were able
to hang out tonight.

05:03.123 --> 05:04.372
Me, too.

05:04.374 --> 05:06.458
Not that it's up to you
to make me happy.

05:06.460 --> 05:08.009
Uh, well, unless
you find neediness sexy.

05:08.011 --> 05:09.711
In which case,
you're about to have dinner

05:09.713 --> 05:12.097
with the hottest man
on the planet.

05:13.799 --> 05:15.467
Can I tell you something?

05:15.469 --> 05:17.219
I was so nervous
about seeing you,

05:17.221 --> 05:19.638
before I left my apartment,
I put roll-on antiperspirant

05:19.640 --> 05:21.890
all over my body.

05:21.892 --> 05:23.424
Really?
Yeah.

05:23.426 --> 05:25.610
If sweat starts squirting
out the top of my head,

05:25.612 --> 05:27.646
you'll know why.

05:27.648 --> 05:29.531
I, uh, I'm sorry
to put you through that.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.449
Oh, it's okay.

05:31.451 --> 05:32.600
I've been trying
to force myself

05:32.602 --> 05:34.286
to do things that
make me scared.

05:34.288 --> 05:36.538
What else have you been
thinking about doing?

05:36.540 --> 05:38.073
Well, let's see.

05:38.075 --> 05:40.575
I'd love to be able to tell
the lady who cuts my hair

05:40.577 --> 05:42.460
that I don't like bangs.

05:42.462 --> 05:44.913
I like your bangs.

05:44.915 --> 05:46.715
Oh, thanks, I
like 'em, too.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:55.641 --> 05:56.841
What else?

05:56.843 --> 05:58.176
Mm...

05:58.178 --> 06:00.061
it's kind of a tie
between sending food back

06:00.063 --> 06:01.980
in a restaurant and
saying no to those kids

06:01.982 --> 06:03.464
who sell magazines
door-to-door.

06:03.466 --> 06:04.683
Mm, yeah.

06:04.685 --> 06:06.601
Those are both toughies.
I know.

06:06.603 --> 06:08.937
I have a two-year
subscription to <i>Guns & Ammo.</i>

06:12.008 --> 06:14.642
I push my shoulder
against the secret door

06:14.644 --> 06:16.194
to see if it gives way.

06:16.196 --> 06:17.312
Uh...

06:17.314 --> 06:18.446
it does.

06:21.251 --> 06:23.918
He does sound
effects, too!

06:25.037 --> 06:27.372
Hey, I always did sound effects.

06:27.374 --> 06:30.675
A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats
fly through the dungeon.

06:34.096 --> 06:36.765
Uh, uh, they attack
a nearby unicorn.

06:42.855 --> 06:45.707
Okay, well, I have a sound
effect for those sound effects.

06:48.811 --> 06:50.979
Guess who!

06:50.981 --> 06:52.280
What are you doing back?

06:52.282 --> 06:55.516
That's an excellent
question. Amy?

06:55.518 --> 06:57.986
Uh, well...

06:57.988 --> 06:59.788
when we were going
through security,

06:59.790 --> 07:02.207
I got pulled
out of line for a pat-down.

07:02.209 --> 07:03.425
The, uh,

07:03.427 --> 07:05.794
TSA agent got
a little handsy...

07:06.612 --> 07:08.129
I may have broken

07:08.131 --> 07:09.864
her nose with my elbow.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.051
Long story short,
she's on the No Fly List

07:13.053 --> 07:16.054
and we might have been
followed here by a drone.

07:16.056 --> 07:17.889
I'm sorry.

07:17.891 --> 07:19.841
I feel like such an idiot.

07:19.843 --> 07:20.875
Oh, it's not so bad.

07:20.877 --> 07:22.310
You lost money, you're
filled with shame

07:22.312 --> 07:23.845
and you got groped
by a stranger.

07:23.847 --> 07:26.314
I mean, that's Vegas,
you nailed it.

07:26.316 --> 07:28.566
You guys enjoy your evening.

07:28.568 --> 07:30.902
I'm gonna go before I ruin
anybody else's weekend.

07:30.904 --> 07:33.388
That's my girl.

07:33.390 --> 07:35.273
No, no.

07:35.275 --> 07:37.275
Amy, wait. Uh, uh,
I know it's not

07:37.277 --> 07:38.443
the night you had in mind,

07:38.445 --> 07:40.195
but why don't you guys stay
and play with us?

07:40.197 --> 07:41.162
It'll be fun.

07:41.164 --> 07:42.364
It would-- fun?

07:42.366 --> 07:43.615
Yeah, okay,
three weeks ago,

07:43.617 --> 07:44.783
you bought crunchy
peanut butter,

07:44.785 --> 07:47.035
but now you want the
girls to play D & D--

07:47.037 --> 07:48.970
do you have a
drug problem?

07:48.972 --> 07:50.588
What's the big deal?

07:50.590 --> 07:53.174
Raj bailed, so we could
use some extra players.

07:53.176 --> 07:54.909
Well, I've just never
played Dungeons & Dragons

07:54.911 --> 07:56.911
with girls before.

07:56.913 --> 07:57.879
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

07:57.881 --> 08:00.031
No one has.

08:01.784 --> 08:03.885
So, what do you say?

08:05.554 --> 08:07.889
I'll leave it up to
the dungeon master.

08:09.109 --> 08:12.277
Yeah, a... satanic fungus

08:12.279 --> 08:15.280
that looks suspiciously
like Al Pacino

08:15.282 --> 08:18.867
rises from the forest floor
and says,

08:18.869 --> 08:21.236
"You're playing D & D.

08:21.238 --> 08:23.321
"You're playing
D & D.

08:23.323 --> 08:26.241
"This whole <i>apartment...</i>

08:27.426 --> 08:30.128
...is playing D & D."

08:41.090 --> 08:42.957
Okay, who wants a drink?

08:42.958 --> 08:46.260
Yeah, we-- now, Penny,
we don't consume alcohol

08:46.262 --> 08:47.795
during Dungeons & Dragons.

08:47.797 --> 08:50.547
It impairs our judgment.

08:50.549 --> 08:52.433
Oh, this isn't alcohol.

08:52.435 --> 08:55.519
It's a magic potion
that makes me like you.

08:58.473 --> 09:01.358
Double potion, please.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.443
Okay, here we go.

09:02.445 --> 09:03.944
You find yourselves

09:03.946 --> 09:08.115
face-to-face
with two hulking ogres.

09:08.117 --> 09:10.150
"What are you doing

09:10.152 --> 09:11.902
"in our dungeon?

09:13.855 --> 09:16.924
You shall die!"

09:16.926 --> 09:19.126
Okay, literal
goose bumps.

09:19.128 --> 09:21.295
Look.

09:21.297 --> 09:22.746
What do you do?

09:22.748 --> 09:24.197
I draw my broadsword.

09:24.199 --> 09:25.365
I ready my
quarter-staff.

09:25.367 --> 09:28.201
I drink my potion.

09:29.838 --> 09:31.872
- I say we attack the big one.
- You know what?

09:31.874 --> 09:33.090
Give me the dice,
I want to roll.

09:33.092 --> 09:34.141
Well, the dungeon master's

09:34.143 --> 09:35.208
supposed to roll.

09:35.210 --> 09:36.560
Yeah, well I'm supposed
to be in Vegas

09:36.562 --> 09:38.545
throwing up on a shrimp buffet.
Now give it.

09:40.765 --> 09:42.399
All right,
what do I need?

09:42.401 --> 09:44.985
Uh, 15 or higher.

09:44.987 --> 09:46.820
15's the point, the point is 15.

09:46.822 --> 09:50.574
Give the little lady some room,
here it is, coming out.

09:50.576 --> 09:51.558
Sixteen!

09:51.560 --> 09:54.078
Yes!

09:54.080 --> 09:56.730
Oh, please tell me
we're playing for money.

09:56.732 --> 09:58.248
Oh, even better than money.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.001
You gained experience points.

10:01.003 --> 10:03.337
More potion, please.

10:03.339 --> 10:04.755
Yeah.

10:05.924 --> 10:08.125
How are
your crab cakes?

10:08.127 --> 10:09.543
Kind of funky.

10:09.545 --> 10:10.344
That's great.

10:10.346 --> 10:11.545
It is?

10:11.547 --> 10:14.932
Does "funky" mean
something different in India?

10:14.934 --> 10:17.434
No, no. Uh, you've always
wanted to send your food back

10:17.436 --> 10:19.019
in a restaurant;
here's your chance.

10:19.044 --> 10:19.888
Mm.

10:19.889 --> 10:21.438
It's okay. I just won't eat 'em.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.524
Don't be ridiculous. Waiter?

10:24.359 --> 10:26.110
Everything all right?

10:26.112 --> 10:28.696
Uh... yeah.

10:28.698 --> 10:31.098
Everything all right with you?

10:31.100 --> 10:32.449
Yes.

10:33.267 --> 10:34.735
'Kay, thanks, bye.

10:34.737 --> 10:36.904
Hold on.

10:36.906 --> 10:39.039
Isn't there something else
you wanted to tell him?

10:39.941 --> 10:42.292
N-No, it-it's fine. Uh...

10:42.294 --> 10:45.946
He's from a different country;
he doesn't understand our ways.

10:47.799 --> 10:49.950
Don't be silly. Just tell him.

10:50.785 --> 10:52.803
I have to go to the bathroom.

10:52.805 --> 10:53.971
And it's not because

10:53.973 --> 10:55.339
the crab cakes are funky.

10:57.142 --> 10:58.425
So you're okay here?

10:58.427 --> 10:59.626
Uh, yeah, sorry.

10:59.628 --> 11:01.645
She's just a little shy.

11:01.647 --> 11:04.014
The-the first time we met,
she was so nervous,

11:04.016 --> 11:06.984
she climbed out a bathroom
window to get away from me.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.650
Uh-oh.

11:27.622 --> 11:29.623
Hey, Raj.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.492
Funny story.

11:33.595 --> 11:36.847
Come on, mama wants a
pair of dead ogres!

11:37.682 --> 11:39.683
17! The larger ogre is dead!

11:41.554 --> 11:43.103
The-the other ogre says,

11:43.105 --> 11:46.356
"You killed my brother.

11:46.358 --> 11:49.843
Now Ogre Thanksgiving
is ruined."

11:50.695 --> 11:52.646
That is amazing.

11:52.648 --> 11:55.199
He made me care
about the ogre!

11:56.117 --> 11:57.895
All right, Amy,
there's one ogre left.

11:57.896 --> 11:59.479
Take him out!
Okay.

11:59.481 --> 12:01.731
Pretend he's that
TSA agent. Come on.

12:03.734 --> 12:04.634
Nineteen!

12:06.471 --> 12:08.104
Yes!

12:08.106 --> 12:10.490
This is turning out to be
even better than Vegas!

12:10.492 --> 12:13.109
No, it's not!

12:16.247 --> 12:17.364
Lucy?

12:17.366 --> 12:18.748
Oh, hey.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.700
Long time no see.

12:23.671 --> 12:24.821
You don't know me very well,

12:24.823 --> 12:26.756
but each time you crawl out
a bathroom window

12:26.758 --> 12:30.293
to escape my company,
it chips away at my masculinity.

12:30.295 --> 12:32.045
I'm sorry.

12:32.047 --> 12:33.680
Why would you leave like that?

12:33.682 --> 12:35.331
You were pushing me;
I clearly didn't want

12:35.333 --> 12:38.268
to send my food back, and you
tried to make me do it anyway.

12:38.270 --> 12:41.855
Okay, if I upset you, then why
didn't you just say something?

12:41.857 --> 12:44.441
Well, how can I tell you I'm
upset if I can't tell the woman

12:44.443 --> 12:47.277
at Supercuts that my forehead's
my best feature?

12:48.779 --> 12:49.896
It's scary.

12:49.898 --> 12:51.698
Yeah, well, I like you a lot,

12:51.700 --> 12:53.566
and that's scary for me.

12:53.568 --> 12:57.287
Mostly because
you're a proven flight risk.

12:57.289 --> 13:00.490
How could you like me a lot?

13:00.492 --> 13:03.243
Well, uh, for one thing,

13:03.245 --> 13:05.378
you have bigger
emotional problems than I do,

13:05.380 --> 13:08.298
and I find that
very attractive in a woman!

13:09.634 --> 13:13.086
I-I don't know. I just...

13:13.088 --> 13:15.255
I think you're wonderful.

13:22.013 --> 13:24.431
I'm sweating out of my head.

13:28.352 --> 13:33.273
The dragon falls from the sky,
crashing into the volcano!

13:34.493 --> 13:36.026
But wait!

13:36.028 --> 13:37.243
He's not dead.

13:37.245 --> 13:38.695
He crawls out,

13:38.697 --> 13:43.416
spreads his wings
and prepares to attack.

13:43.418 --> 13:44.451
Yeah, uh, wait!

13:46.203 --> 13:48.571
Doesn't he say
something first?

13:48.573 --> 13:52.559
You know, maybe in the voice
of a beloved celebrity?

13:52.561 --> 13:54.377
Fine.

13:54.379 --> 13:58.214
"You'd think, after all these years,

13:58.216 --> 14:03.770
"I'd know not to fly
over volcanoes.

14:03.772 --> 14:06.106
I'm a freaking idiot."

14:08.309 --> 14:10.143
The dragon's
Christopher Walken!

14:10.145 --> 14:12.645
That's perfect.

14:12.647 --> 14:13.947
All right, Amy,
it's your turn.

14:13.949 --> 14:15.031
We need one more hit.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.033
Finish him off!
Here we go.

14:17.035 --> 14:18.585
Fifteen?

14:18.587 --> 14:20.937
It's a hit. The dragon collapses
to the ground!

14:20.939 --> 14:22.655
Wait.

14:22.657 --> 14:23.990
Wait.

14:23.992 --> 14:26.826
And says...

14:26.828 --> 14:29.162
"Mother?

14:29.164 --> 14:31.664
"Is that you?

14:32.800 --> 14:36.386
Your little boy is coming home."

14:38.172 --> 14:41.141
Oh, I don't know about you
guys, but I have been through

14:41.143 --> 14:43.343
the emotional
wringer tonight.

14:43.345 --> 14:45.562
This may be the potion
talking, but you are

14:45.564 --> 14:48.681
one fine-ass dungeon master.

14:48.683 --> 14:50.233
Oh, yeah?
Well, when we get home,

14:50.235 --> 14:52.102
I'm gonna take you
on a whole different adventure.

14:52.104 --> 14:54.154
Another quest

14:54.156 --> 14:56.906
by Wolowitz?
Count me in.

14:58.542 --> 15:01.027
Sheldon, they're talking
about sex.

15:01.029 --> 15:04.147
Oh, then I'm out.

15:05.282 --> 15:06.983
Ooh! I have an idea.

15:06.985 --> 15:08.918
Since it's not happening
anytime soon,

15:08.920 --> 15:11.371
why don't your character
and your character

15:11.373 --> 15:13.339
do it in the game?

15:13.341 --> 15:15.341
Ooh!

15:16.026 --> 15:17.460
Come on, back
me up here.

15:17.462 --> 15:18.428
Oh.

15:18.430 --> 15:20.830
Ooh!
Ooh!

15:21.999 --> 15:26.102
Okay, I cast a love spell
on Sheldon and Amy.

15:26.104 --> 15:29.773
Oo... Sorry, I thought
you were gonna do that...

15:31.776 --> 15:33.977
The love spell takes effect.

15:33.979 --> 15:35.395
When Sheldon looks

15:35.397 --> 15:38.848
at Amy, she is the most
beautiful half-orc

15:38.850 --> 15:40.450
he's ever seen,

15:40.452 --> 15:42.318
and he's overcome

15:42.320 --> 15:44.687
with a desire
to rip her armor off

15:44.689 --> 15:48.575
and gaze fondly
at her four hairy breasts.

15:49.827 --> 15:53.797
When Amy sees Sheldon,
he looks...

15:53.799 --> 15:56.866
well, just like Sheldon, 'cause
apparently she's into that.

15:58.552 --> 15:59.886
What do you do?

16:01.589 --> 16:03.223
I don't like this.

16:11.165 --> 16:14.717
You see what happens
when you let girls play D & D?

16:17.771 --> 16:20.106
Amy.

16:20.108 --> 16:21.658
Amy.

16:22.661 --> 16:24.444
Amy.

16:24.446 --> 16:26.663
What?

16:28.749 --> 16:31.234
I've never knocked
on my own door before.

16:32.620 --> 16:34.954
That was a wild ride.

16:34.956 --> 16:38.091
You don't have to come in here
and cheer me up.

16:38.093 --> 16:39.676
Thank you.

16:39.678 --> 16:41.427
Would you go tell
everyone else that?

16:41.429 --> 16:43.613
Because they sure think
otherwise.

16:44.515 --> 16:46.799
I'll tell you what they think.

16:46.801 --> 16:49.853
They think our relationship
is a joke.

16:50.971 --> 16:53.890
Well, I don't think
our relationship is a joke.

16:53.892 --> 16:55.642
I think

16:55.644 --> 16:57.093
"a horse goes into a bar,

16:57.095 --> 16:58.878
bartender says,
'Why the long face?'"

16:58.880 --> 17:00.914
That's a joke.

17:02.383 --> 17:06.185
It's a good one, too,
because a horse has a long face.

17:07.021 --> 17:09.605
Sheldon,

17:09.607 --> 17:12.825
are we ever going to have
an intimate relationship?

17:12.827 --> 17:14.877
Oh, my.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.880
That's an uncomfortable topic.

17:19.782 --> 17:22.518
Amy...

17:22.520 --> 17:24.721
fore I met you,

17:24.723 --> 17:28.942
I never had any interest
in being intimate with anyone.

17:29.777 --> 17:31.377
And now?

17:32.980 --> 17:35.531
And now what?

17:37.634 --> 17:40.353
Do you have any interest now?

17:42.106 --> 17:43.690
I have not ruled it out.

17:43.692 --> 17:45.091
Wow.

17:45.093 --> 17:47.327
Talk dirty to me.

17:47.329 --> 17:50.813
I know it doesn't seem
like it to you, but,

17:50.815 --> 17:53.199
for me, what we have

17:53.201 --> 17:56.419
is extremely intimate.

17:57.254 --> 17:59.989
I guess I know that.

17:59.991 --> 18:02.292
It's just...

18:02.294 --> 18:04.327
part of me wants more.

18:04.329 --> 18:06.346
More?

18:06.348 --> 18:07.931
I mean, look at us.

18:07.933 --> 18:10.717
It's only been three years;
here we are in bed together.

18:15.522 --> 18:17.924
Come on.

18:17.926 --> 18:19.525
Let's go back out there.

18:19.527 --> 18:22.678
Y... Well, no.
Hold on.

18:22.680 --> 18:27.984
My Elven magic-user
and your half-orc warrior

18:27.986 --> 18:31.020
did have a love spell
cast on them.

18:32.122 --> 18:34.123
We wouldn't really
be playing the game right

18:34.125 --> 18:36.359
if we didn't see that through.

18:37.177 --> 18:39.712
Okay.

18:41.732 --> 18:46.586
I believe that, uh,
we just killed a dragon.

18:48.422 --> 18:51.341
While the others
pillage the corpse,

18:51.343 --> 18:55.345
I lead you
to a secluded area

18:55.347 --> 19:00.549
where I attempt
to remove your leather armor.

19:05.389 --> 19:06.322
It comes off.

19:06.324 --> 19:09.275
Oh.

19:10.194 --> 19:11.744
What do you do?

19:14.398 --> 19:16.565
I...

19:17.751 --> 19:20.586
...kiss you... on the lips.

19:22.289 --> 19:26.459
I kiss you back on the...

19:28.796 --> 19:30.263
...lips as well.

19:31.882 --> 19:34.017
Your turn.

19:35.719 --> 19:38.388
I... remove your armor.

19:40.257 --> 19:42.225
What do you do?

19:42.227 --> 19:46.696
I... erotically caress your...

19:49.366 --> 19:50.400
...nose.

19:50.402 --> 19:51.951
Keep rolling.

20:04.426 --> 20:06.627
Hey, you guys have been
in there for a while.

20:06.629 --> 20:08.629
- You doing okay?
- We're fine, thank you.

20:08.631 --> 20:10.648
Okay, we just want to say,
we feel really bad about...

20:10.650 --> 20:13.768
Go away! Sheldon
is nibbling on my...

20:13.770 --> 20:15.636
14! Yes!
