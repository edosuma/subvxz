00:29.697 --> 00:34.035
<i>Long ago, the Great Frith made the world.</i>

00:40.124 --> 00:42.209
<i>He made all the stars...</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.923
<i>and the world lived among the stars.</i>

00:54.472 --> 00:57.475
<i>Frith made all the animals and birds...</i>

00:57.558 --> 01:00.186
<i>and at first made them all the same.</i>

01:01.145 --> 01:06.233
<i>Now among the animals was El-Ahrairah,
the Prince of Rabbits.</i>

01:08.569 --> 01:10.488
<i>He had many friends...</i>

01:13.074 --> 01:15.409
<i>and they all ate grass together.</i>

01:15.910 --> 01:18.871
<i>But after a time
the rabbits wandered everywhere...</i>

01:18.954 --> 01:21.624
<i>multiplying and eating as they went.</i>

01:27.713 --> 01:29.423
<i>Then Frith said to EI-Ahrairah...</i>

01:30.257 --> 01:34.011
<i>“Prince Rabbit,
if you cannot control your people...</i>

01:34.095 --> 01:37.056
<i>I shall find ways to control them.</i> ”

01:37.139 --> 01:40.684
<i>But EI-Ahrairah would not listen,
and said to Frith...</i>

01:40.768 --> 01:43.604
<i>“My people are the strongest in the world.”</i>

01:45.481 --> 01:47.191
<i>This angered Frith...</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:50.319
<i>so he determined
to get the better of EI-Ahrairah.</i>

01:50.402 --> 01:53.823
<i>He gave a present
to every animal and bird...</i>

01:53.906 --> 01:56.909
<i>making each one different from the rest.</i>

01:56.992 --> 01:59.370
<i>When the fox came...</i>

01:59.453 --> 02:01.747
<i>and others like the dog and cat...</i>

02:01.831 --> 02:04.917
<i>and hawk and weasel...</i>

02:06.794 --> 02:09.713
<i>to each of them
Frith gave a fierce desire...</i>

02:09.797 --> 02:12.716
<i>to hunt and slay
the children of EI-Ahrairah.</i>

02:25.813 --> 02:28.774
<i>Then EI-Ahrairah knew
that Frith was too clever for him...</i>

02:28.858 --> 02:30.693
<i>and he was frightened.</i>

02:30.776 --> 02:34.321
<i>He had never before
seen the Black Rabbit of Death.</i>

02:38.868 --> 02:42.037
<i>“My friend,” said Frith.</i>

02:42.121 --> 02:46.667
<i>“Have you seen EI-Ahrairah?
For I wish to give him a gift.”</i>

02:46.750 --> 02:48.711
<i>“Uh, uh</i> -

02:48.794 --> 02:52.089
<i>No, uh, uh, I have not seen him.”</i>

02:52.173 --> 02:57.261
<i>So Frith said, “Come out,
and I will bless you instead.”</i>

02:57.344 --> 03:01.098
<i>“No, I cannot, l am busy.
The fox and weasel are coming.</i>

03:01.182 --> 03:05.144
<i>If you want to bless me,
you'll have to bless my bottom.”</i>

03:05.227 --> 03:08.689
<i>“Very well. Be it so.”</i>

03:10.232 --> 03:13.402
<i>And El-Ahrairah's tail
grew shining white...</i>

03:13.485 --> 03:16.238
<i>and ﬂashed like a star...</i>

03:16.322 --> 03:19.074
<i>and his back legs grew
long and powerful...</i>

03:21.076 --> 03:25.456
<i>and he tore across the hill
faster than any creature in the world.</i>

03:31.879 --> 03:34.965
<i>“All the world will be your enemy...</i>

03:35.049 --> 03:37.134
<i>Prince With a Thousand Enemies.</i>

03:38.010 --> 03:41.764
<i>And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.</i>

03:44.975 --> 03:47.228
<i>But first they must catch you...</i>

03:47.311 --> 03:50.022
<i>digger, listener...</i>

03:50.105 --> 03:51.232
<i>runner</i> ...

03:51.315 --> 03:53.234
<i>prince with the swift warning.</i>

03:55.945 --> 03:59.823
<i>Be cunning and full of tricks...</i>

03:59.907 --> 04:03.827
<i>and your people
will never be destroyed.”</i>

05:44.178 --> 05:47.264
I've done a fine bit o' rough
shootin' around this old field, Ted.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.391
Down along edge of that wood there.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.477
Enjoyed many a game pie from it too.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.480
Ah, well, you can't hold back progress.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.231
Shame though.

05:56.315 --> 06:00.861
Good Lord, it's gone 8:00, and I told Elisabeth
we'd go into Newbury this evening.

06:00.944 --> 06:04.782
Old sun sets so late in summer,
it's mornin' before evenin' comes.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.196
I think it's safe now, Fiver.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.701
Well, there's still something
strange about the warren this evening.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.664
Is it dangerous?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.291
It's not exactly danger. it's -

06:56.375 --> 06:59.753
Oh, I don't know.
Something oppressive...

06:59.837 --> 07:01.547
like thunder.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.799
It seems safe enough now though.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.677
Come on then.
See if you can find me a coltsfoot.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.762
If you can't, no one can.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.563
- What's going on?
- It's only that runt Fiver.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.940
Jumping at bluebottles again.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.743
Come on. Hurry up.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.829
Fiver found it, Toadﬂax.

07:33.912 --> 07:38.375
And <i>we'll</i> eat it.
Coltsfoots are for Owsla. You know that.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.177
Tell you the truth,
I'm getting sick and tired of it.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.430
Sometimes I feel like
clearing out of the warren altogether.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.559
Never mind. Let's forget it
and try to enjoy the evening.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.092
Hazel?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.761
Oh, Hazel.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.679
This is where it comes from.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.433
I know now.
A terrible thing is coming.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.895
- What do you mean?
- Look.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.940
The field.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.026
The field.
It's covered with blood.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.987
Blood?
Don't be silly.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.721
All right. All right, Fiver. it's getting dark.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.349
- I think we should get back to the burrow.
- Back to the burrow?

09:17.432 --> 09:19.226
It'll come there.
Don't think it won't.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.603
it's all around us.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.230
Now stop it, Fiver.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.107
We-We - We've -

09:25.190 --> 09:27.234
We've got to go away from here -
all of us.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.111
Go away?
The whole warren?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.154
Yes. Before it's too late.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.741
You're being silly. They won't come.
They'll think you're out of your mind.

09:34.825 --> 09:38.829
You must listen to me, Hazel.
Something very bad is going to happen.

09:38.912 --> 09:43.083
Well, I suppose we'd better
try and see the Chief Rabbit.

09:43.166 --> 09:47.212
You can tell him about it,
but I don't expect he'll like the idea at all.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.678
We've got to go away
from the warren - all of us!

09:54.761 --> 09:57.514
- Go away?
- Yes. Before it's too late.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.516
- Is there something wrong?
- What's he on about?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.060
- What's the matter, do you think?
- Is there danger?

10:05.606 --> 10:07.691
Come on.
Let's find out what's happening.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.117
- Hazel? It is Hazel, isn't it?
- It is.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.704
- What are you doing here?
- We want to see the Chief Rabbit, Bigwig.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.498
We? You mean
he wants to see him too?

10:23.582 --> 10:25.125
- Yes.
- I must.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.711
- What's it all about?
- Well, it's -

10:27.794 --> 10:30.255
Bigwig, what do they want?

10:30.339 --> 10:32.341
- They want to see the Chief Rabbit.
- What for?

10:32.424 --> 10:34.134
- Well, I have to -
- Send them away.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.803
I'll take care of it, Holly.

10:36.887 --> 10:41.183
Look, Bigwig. When have I ever
asked to see the Chief Rabbit before?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.393
Oh, Well.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.479
All right. All right.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.482
Wait here.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.695
Excuse me, sir. These two outskirters
have asked permission to see you.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.822
Is it all right if I bring them down?

10:56.657 --> 11:00.494
Come on then - though I'll probably
get my ears chewed off for this.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.459
Ah, Walnut.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.420
It is Walnut, isn't it?

11:10.504 --> 11:13.590
- No, sir. Hazel.
- Hazel?

11:13.674 --> 11:15.467
Of course.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.261
I knew your mother well.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.389
And your friend?

11:20.472 --> 11:22.391
My brother, sir. Fiver.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.227
Your brother. Ah.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.563
Now do tell me how I can help you.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.775
Well, he says there's a bad danger
coming to our warren.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.861
A bad danger?

11:41.451 --> 11:43.453
How very upsetting.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.832
Now what sort of danger, I wonder?

11:46.915 --> 11:50.460
I don't know, but it's bad.
It's so bad!

11:50.544 --> 11:53.922
Well, now, what ought we to do?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.799
Go away - all of us - now.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.052
Now? In May?

11:59.136 --> 12:01.138
The mating season?

12:01.221 --> 12:03.348
And where would we go to?

12:03.432 --> 12:06.560
Well, he's had these feelings before,
and he's been right again and again.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.396
I shall have to consider this very carefully.

12:10.397 --> 12:14.025
And perhaps <i>we'll</i> discuss it
later in the summer.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.236
We can't wait!
We can't wait!

12:16.319 --> 12:19.573
Well, it's been good
of you to come, Walnut.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.414
Bigwig.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.541
Bigwig.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.711
- Sir?
- What was that all about?

12:32.794 --> 12:33.837
Well, sir -

12:33.920 --> 12:37.799
Your duty as an officer
is to protect this burrow.

12:37.883 --> 12:41.511
- Yes, sir.
- And those two lunatics had better be watched.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.888
Yes, sir.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.852
- Who's that?
- It's me.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.937
- Dandelion?
- No.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.190
Blackberry.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.859
Dandelion told me
you were leaving the warren tonight.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.197
- If it's true, I'd like to come along.
- We'd like to come along too.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.366
- I don't much like the look of things.
- We must get everyone.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.369
That Toadﬂax fella
followed me down the run.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.039
It could mean
the Owsla's been turned out.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.792
Right. Then the sooner we're off, the better.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.899
It's the Owsla.
They're coming.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.086
There aren't many of you left, are there?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.964
Bigwig? Are you off duty?

13:59.047 --> 14:02.342
Off duty, and likely to remain off.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.594
I've left the Owsla.

14:04.678 --> 14:09.057
Fiver, I've been thinking about
what you said. Are you sure?

14:09.140 --> 14:12.102
I'm sure, and - and we're leaving.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.480
Leaving? All of you? Where to?

14:15.564 --> 14:18.400
We don't know exactly,
but we're going.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.610
- You're all under arrest.
- Under arrest?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.320
- What do you mean?
- What for?

14:22.404 --> 14:24.531
Spreading dissension,
inciting to mutiny.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.117
- There's a bad danger coming.
- That's not good.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.661
You'll all come with me.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.538
Is he alone?

14:31.621 --> 14:33.790
I am Captain of Owsla.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.293
Go, now...

14:36.376 --> 14:37.502
or we'll kill you.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.547
It is you who'll be killed.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.968
- Bigwig!
- Yes, you know me.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.517
He won't be long
coming back with the Owsla.

14:52.601 --> 14:56.229
Right.
Well, I think <i>I'll</i> come with you.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.183
Hazel, <i>we'll</i> have to stop here.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.560
Fiver and that other half-size one
are all in.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.021
- They need to rest.
- He's right, Hazel.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.733
Look. Once we're beyond the woods,
<i>we'll</i> really be clear of the Owsla...

15:41.816 --> 15:43.818
and we can rest then.

15:52.535 --> 15:56.706
I've never been in a wood before, Hazel.
It looks dangerous.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.627
Follow me.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.141
A lendri!

16:56.891 --> 16:58.601
This way.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.693
It had just killed.
I saw blood on its lips.

17:06.776 --> 17:10.571
Lucky for us it had -
otherwise it might have been quicker.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.021
- We shall have to cross it.
- Cross it?

17:43.104 --> 17:46.316
Who's going to cross it?
What do you want to cross it for?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.318
Are you sure about this?

17:48.401 --> 17:51.404
Yes. But I don't think I can swim, Hazel.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.491
I'm worn out,
and Pipkin's even worse off than me.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.870
- We can't just sit here.
- I know what we ought to be looking for -

17:58.953 --> 18:02.165
a high, lonely place with dry soil...

18:02.248 --> 18:05.752
where we can see and hear all around...

18:05.835 --> 18:08.171
and men hardly ever come.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.934
- There's a dog loose in the wood.
- Well, that does it.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.394
- A dog?
- Come on.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.397
What do you think will happen
when he picks up our scent?

18:26.481 --> 18:29.025
Those that can swim, swim.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.528
The others will have to
make out the best they can.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.530
That's not good enough.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.282
We all got into this together.
We'll all get out of it together.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.493
Hazel. Look.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.081
It ﬂoats!

18:43.164 --> 18:45.458
That's it. That's it!

18:45.542 --> 18:48.545
Fiver, get on, quickly.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.473
Silver, Bigwig,
get your nose under it. Push it out.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.309
Quickly!

19:11.818 --> 19:13.820
Oh, no. I'm slipping.
I'm slipping. I'm slipping.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.488
Oh, no!

19:20.618 --> 19:22.370
Keep still!

19:26.749 --> 19:28.418
- You all right?
- Of course.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.924
That was a good idea of yours, Blackberry.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.844
Yes. Let's try to remember it.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.929
It might come in handy again.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.626
Does anyone know where we're going?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.711
Hazel does, I'm sure.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.094
I've never seen anything like that before.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.513
- The man thing killed it.
- A man thing?

20:22.597 --> 20:24.807
A Hrududu. It runs on it.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.518
- The what?
- The Hrududu.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.938
- It runs on it?
- Yeah. Faster than we can.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.940
It's dangerous then - could catch us.

20:32.023 --> 20:36.152
No, no. It won't take any notice
of us at all. <i>I'll</i> show you.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.737
Watch this.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.576
See? it's not interested.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.582
What are you waiting for?

20:49.666 --> 20:52.001
Well, come along then.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.110
They need to rest, Hazel.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.154
There's something up ahead.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.615
A warm, friendly burrow perhaps?

21:22.699 --> 21:25.451
No, no, no. Not a burrow. A field.

21:25.535 --> 21:28.037
A great field of scented plants
that will cover us...

21:28.121 --> 21:29.872
sight and sound,
until we're rested.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.667
You're beginning
to sound like a chief, Hazel.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.919
- Hazel-rah.
- Hazel-rah?

21:35.003 --> 21:37.463
That'll be the day
I call him chief, that will.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.176
Violet's gone.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.932
We'd better keep moving.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.797
We'll have to stop soon, Hazel.
They're frightened and tired.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.634
There. We'll rest there.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.261
Can't rest there.
That's a man place.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.389
There are no men there now.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.404
It looks all right.

25:02.752 --> 25:05.004
What's happening back home,
I wonder.

25:06.297 --> 25:09.550
Think when we lived
in our own burrows, eh?

25:10.218 --> 25:12.220
Dry, soft.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.014
Warm bodies.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.141
Now look.
We can't go on like this.

25:17.225 --> 25:20.269
It gets worse and worse the further we go.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.189
Where are we going?

25:23.272 --> 25:26.192
It won't be much longer,
then we can all rest.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.778
- How much longer?
- We never should have left.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.613
Suppose Fiver's all wrong?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.615
We want to go back and find out.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.368
Go back?
After all we've been through?

25:35.451 --> 25:39.205
And probably get killed for wounding
Captain Holly, an Owsla officer?

25:39.288 --> 25:40.790
Talk sense, for Frith's sake.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.876
We must go on...
until we reach the hills.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.629
Those that go back will not -

25:47.713 --> 25:49.257
Not safe.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.385
Not safe.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.639
I don't believe you know
where you're going.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.517
Now listen to me,
you bunch of mole-snouted, muckraking -

26:04.021 --> 26:05.982
It looks like you've come a long way.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.318
Do you live here?

26:09.402 --> 26:10.903
Yes.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.072
Uh, yes, this is our warren.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.992
Well, we need to stay here for a while.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.328
Why not?
We supposed you would.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.414
But I don't think there are
enough of you, are there...

26:21.497 --> 26:24.375
to live very comfortably on your own?

26:24.458 --> 26:26.544
There are enough of us
to protect ourselves.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.504
Oh, don't get upset.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.756
Who are you?
What do you want?

26:31.549 --> 26:33.843
My name is Cowslip,
and I don't want anything.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.012
Yeah. What about the others?

26:36.095 --> 26:40.099
We have plenty of empty burrows,
if that's what you mean.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.144
And now, if you'll excuse me...

26:43.227 --> 26:45.187
I hate the rain.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.193
Hmm. Funny smell.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.196
We ought to have nothing to do
with that Cowslip or his warren.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.283
Well, it might be drier in there.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.952
Whatever will he think of us
if we don't go in?

27:00.036 --> 27:01.954
I'll tell you.
<i>He'll</i> think we're afraid.

27:02.038 --> 27:03.914
Afraid? Who's afraid?

27:03.998 --> 27:06.042
He seemed friendly enough.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.128
But what has he got to gain
by asking us to join him?

27:09.670 --> 27:11.631
We can't sit out here like fools.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.716
Well? Come along then.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.889
They think I'm mad,
but you know I'm not...

27:19.972 --> 27:21.932
and you still won't listen.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.561
Hazel?

27:29.148 --> 27:31.192
Come along, Fiver.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.998
There's that smell again.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.835
It's almost like... man.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.843
Oh, it's you, is it? How nice.
We're so glad you've come.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.970
This is rather a big warren.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.809
Yes. Please, help yourself to ﬂayrah.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.603
There are fresh roots here daily.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.855
The man throws it out.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.982
Man? What man?

28:12.525 --> 28:15.277
A lot of the burrows are lying empty,
you know...

28:15.361 --> 28:19.615
so you're all welcome
to any that you choose.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.992
Where are all the others?

28:22.827 --> 28:28.708
Please, eat all you like. We'll leave you
to your, uh - to yourselves.

28:28.791 --> 28:31.252
- Where are they all?
- Where?

28:31.335 --> 28:34.130
Try asking Cowslip “where” anything.

28:34.213 --> 28:39.927
They seem sad, like -
like trees in November.

28:40.010 --> 28:43.347
Yeah, well, I still think
we've made a big change for the better.

28:43.431 --> 28:47.143
Do you think the man puts the food
out there because of a kind heart?

28:47.226 --> 28:50.563
Well, it's not poisoned.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.649
There's something unnatural and...

28:53.733 --> 28:56.736
evil and twisted about this place.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.487
It feels -

28:58.571 --> 29:01.490
It feels like... mist.

29:01.574 --> 29:05.494
Like being deceived...
and losing our way.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.914
Some of us are gathering
and suggesting stories.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.541
We're hoping you'll tell one.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.335
Hazel can tell you
about our adventures...

29:13.419 --> 29:15.838
and how we had
the good luck to join you.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.924
Surely there's no harm in that?

29:20.634 --> 29:24.513
Uh, Dandelion, why don't you tell us
a story of El-Ahrairah?

29:24.597 --> 29:28.100
El-Ahrairah and his trickery
don't really mean very much to us...

29:28.184 --> 29:29.727
charming as it is.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.979
Rabbits will always need tricks.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.356
No, we need dignity...

29:34.940 --> 29:37.902
and above all,
the will to accept our fate.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.697
As one of our poets is fond
of saying, if I may quote -

29:41.781 --> 29:42.865
- Yes, please.
- Yes, yes.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.033
- Yes, of course.
- Why not?

29:44.116 --> 29:44.867
Please do.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.536
“'Where are you going, stream?'

29:47.620 --> 29:50.080
'Far, far away.'

29:50.164 --> 29:55.294
'Take me with you, stream.
Take me on your dark journey.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.838
Lord Frith, oh, take me.

29:57.922 --> 30:01.175
Take me far away
to the heart of light.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.220
The silence.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.847
I give you my breath...

30:06.931 --> 30:08.724
my life.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.476
- The silence.”'
- I've had enough.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.577
Where are you going?

30:28.661 --> 30:30.788
Away - to the hills.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.957
By yourself? Alone?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.333
<i>You'll die.</i>

30:34.416 --> 30:36.210
You're closer to death than I.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.379
You're determined to ruin it for us,
aren't you?

30:38.462 --> 30:39.588
No.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.757
It's me, me, me all the time.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.342
- But -
- “I'm in a mist.”

30:43.425 --> 30:45.094
- Bigwig -
- “Everything's bad.”

30:45.177 --> 30:47.471
- No.
- “I've a funny feeling in my toe.”

30:47.555 --> 30:49.014
No, no, it-l-

30:49.098 --> 30:50.516
Hraka!

30:50.599 --> 30:54.186
I'm finished with you. And what's more,
I'm gonna make sure everyone else is.

31:08.909 --> 31:11.328
Bigwig, listen.
You're in a snare.

31:11.412 --> 31:15.541
A snare.
What did they tell you in Owsla? Think!

31:16.625 --> 31:20.087
No good biting wire.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.214
Run, Fiver.
Run to the warren and get the others.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.258
Blackberry, Silver.
<i>And</i> Cowslip.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.843
Be quick! <i>He'll</i> die.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.387
Blackberry! Dandelion! Come quickly.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.184
Come on. Come on.
Hurry up.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.228
It's Bigwig.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.692
He's still breathing.
What can we do?

31:41.775 --> 31:44.778
- We've got to loosen the wire somehow.
- Yes. But how?

31:44.862 --> 31:46.780
Is Cowslip coming?
Maybe he knows.

31:46.864 --> 31:49.450
He wouldn't come.
He told me to stop talking about it.

31:49.533 --> 31:52.620
- He told you what?
- This is it. The wire's on a peg.

31:52.703 --> 31:55.539
- We've got to dig it out.
- The peg's narrower down there.

31:55.623 --> 31:58.667
It tapers.
But I can't get my teeth into it.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.794
Pipkin, you go in.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.090
The splinters prick you.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.717
It's hard to breathe...

32:07.301 --> 32:09.011
but the peg's nearly through.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.347
Fiver, you go in.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.515
I can't hear him breathing.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.267
It's broken in two. it's free!

32:21.273 --> 32:24.443
Bigwig, the peg's out. You're free.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.196
I-I think he's gone.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.908
We've got you out, Bigwig.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.493
You're free.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.746
- Bigwig, please don't die.
- It's no use.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.998
We got you out.

32:38.082 --> 32:40.125
What shall we do without him?

32:41.126 --> 32:43.837
My heart has joined the Thousand -

32:43.921 --> 32:46.423
for my friend stopped running today.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.052
You pay for it -
the food, the warren -

32:50.135 --> 32:53.222
but no one must ever ask where
anyone was or speak of the wires.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.641
The whole place is snared!
Everywhere, every day!

32:55.724 --> 32:58.727
- They left Bigwig to die.
- Silver's right.

32:58.811 --> 33:02.481
Let's drive them out - take their warren
and live there ourselves.

33:02.564 --> 33:07.236
- Yes! Back to the warren!
- Yes! Yes! Yes, back to the warren!

33:07.319 --> 33:09.697
Oh, Embleer Frith. You fools!

33:09.780 --> 33:11.573
That warren's nothing
but a death hole.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.659
Yes, let's help ourselves
to a roof of bones.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.661
<i>I'll</i> kill them.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.746
Bigwig!

33:17.830 --> 33:19.415
You're alive!

33:19.498 --> 33:21.500
- Are you all right?
- We thought you were dead.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.253
- Bigwig!
- Let him alone. Let him rest.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.338
Don't have to rest.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.222
- What do we do now, Fiver?
- Go away from here.

33:36.432 --> 33:38.100
Look.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.935
Look!

33:40.019 --> 33:42.312
That's the place for us.

33:42.396 --> 33:44.314
High lonely hills...

33:44.398 --> 33:46.734
where the wind and the sound carry...

33:46.817 --> 33:50.195
and the ground's as dry
as straw in a barn.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.698
That's where we ought to be.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.867
That's where we have to get to.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.817
Pipkin?

34:29.693 --> 34:31.402
Pipkin?

34:31.487 --> 34:33.197
<i>-</i> Pipkin?
- Hmm?

34:34.989 --> 34:36.699
Why don't we go and look round the farm?

34:38.077 --> 34:39.328
Uh, um -

34:39.411 --> 34:42.081
Farm, Hazel? What for?

34:43.123 --> 34:44.958
Cats and dogs and -

34:45.042 --> 34:47.335
I've got a little plan.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.589
- Won't it be dangerous?
- Of course not.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.466
Is it safe?

34:52.549 --> 34:54.635
Of course.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.303
Let's - Let's all go.

34:56.386 --> 34:59.139
No. Just you...

34:59.223 --> 35:00.599
and me.

35:24.248 --> 35:26.333
I think I see a dog.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.503
Where? Oh, it's tied up.

35:29.586 --> 35:32.965
But give it a wide berth.
We don't want it to wake up the whole farm.

35:41.515 --> 35:44.059
<i>This is the BBC Home Service, and now</i> -

35:44.143 --> 35:46.061
They are up.

35:46.145 --> 35:48.522
Hazel, let's go back.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.607
Just a little further.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.824
Rabbits. So that's your secret plan.

35:59.366 --> 36:02.202
I'm going inside to take a look around.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.254
Is it safe in there?

36:12.337 --> 36:13.755
Of course.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.008
You wait here.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.051
Oh, but if you see a cat -

36:18.135 --> 36:19.845
A cat?

36:19.928 --> 36:23.015
- You will let me know at once, all right?
- Right.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.021
I'm Hazel.

36:30.272 --> 36:31.690
Hazel.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.526
My name's Clover.

36:34.610 --> 36:38.780
- Where do you come from?
- Oh, far away.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.949
My friends and I live as we please.

36:41.033 --> 36:44.077
We eat grass, lie in the sun.

36:45.037 --> 36:48.248
- Do you ever get out?
- Oh, yes. Well, sometimes...

36:48.332 --> 36:50.292
a child takes us out on the grass.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.502
Would you like to join us?

36:52.586 --> 36:56.089
Join you? But how?
How can we join you?

36:57.382 --> 37:00.302
Hazel! There's a cat outside.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.263
I must go back to my friends...

37:03.347 --> 37:06.350
but <i>we'll</i> be back, and any of you
who wish can come along with us.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.977
- Where is it?
- There.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.313
I think it's smelt us.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.565
- I'll get you away.
- Thank you.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.193
Just follow me closely.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.903
Oh, yes.

37:17.986 --> 37:21.073
- And run when I do.
- Run when you do.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.494
You look hungry.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.246
Rats getting too clever, I suppose.

37:28.330 --> 37:32.000
I bet you can't run at all, hmm? Hmm?

37:32.084 --> 37:35.003
You pie-eyed,
saucer-licking scrap scraper.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.756
- Can you run?
- You'll see.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.925
I think not.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.885
Whoa!

37:52.646 --> 37:54.439
What's all that then?

37:54.982 --> 37:57.109
Tab? Tab!

37:57.192 --> 37:59.611
Let it alone.

37:59.695 --> 38:01.280
Cruel thing.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.104
- Zorn!
- What is it?

38:34.187 --> 38:35.397
Zorn!

38:35.480 --> 38:37.733
There's something coming up
the line of the hedge.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.402
Can you see it?

38:40.485 --> 38:42.237
I hear it.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.239
It's something big.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.742
- A cat?
- I-I don't know.

38:47.743 --> 38:49.578
Bigwig!

38:50.495 --> 38:52.080
Bigwig!

38:59.504 --> 39:01.673
Quiet! I want to listen.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.843
Bigwig!

39:05.427 --> 39:07.304
Bigwig!

39:07.387 --> 39:09.598
It's the Black Rabbit of lnlé.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.767
Don't talk like that.
They'll go tharn.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.644
We go by the will of the Black Rabbit.

39:15.145 --> 39:17.773
When he calls you, you have to go.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.858
Stay where you are.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.779
- Who - Who's there?
- All dead.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.032
Oh, Zorn!

39:30.577 --> 39:32.204
It's Captain Holly!

39:34.331 --> 39:36.583
Holly! It's me, Bigwig!

39:36.666 --> 39:38.710
I've found you.

39:40.087 --> 39:41.797
I've found you.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.716
He's been hurt.
Look at the wound on his shoulder.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.303
I remember you.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.347
You're the one that saw it coming.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.933
But... what happened?

39:53.016 --> 39:56.311
Our warren - destroyed!

39:56.395 --> 39:59.189
Destroyed? How?

39:59.272 --> 40:02.526
<i>Men came, filled in the burrows.</i>

40:04.528 --> 40:06.488
<i>Couldn't get out.</i>

40:06.571 --> 40:10.283
<i>There was a strange sound - hissing.</i>

40:11.243 --> 40:13.078
<i>The air turned bad.</i>

40:13.829 --> 40:16.164
<i>Runs blocked with dead bodies.</i>

40:16.248 --> 40:18.875
Couldn't get <i>out.</i>

40:19.751 --> 40:21.670
<i>Everything turned mad.</i>

40:22.254 --> 40:25.257
<i>The warren, earth, roots, grass -</i>

40:25.340 --> 40:27.592
<i>all pushed into the air.</i>

40:31.555 --> 40:33.473
Men have always hated us.

40:33.557 --> 40:35.225
No.

40:35.308 --> 40:38.770
They just destroyed the warren
because we were in their way.

40:39.438 --> 40:42.274
They'll never rest
until they've spoiled the earth.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.318
I tried to find you.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.196
I wandered for days.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.117
The Efrafans wouldn't let me go.

40:52.701 --> 40:54.619
They ripped my ear.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.372
Ripped it.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.958
I tried to find you.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.543
Efrafans?

41:01.626 --> 41:03.587
What's he talking about?

41:04.171 --> 41:05.422
Holly?

41:05.505 --> 41:08.258
Let him be. He's had a bad time.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.511
He can tell us about it when he's rested.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.410
A young doe has a request, sir.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.829
A doe? Wants to see me?

41:37.913 --> 41:40.290
Says she represents a group, sir.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.375
Hmm. <i>I'll</i> see her.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.841
- Your name?
- Hyzenthlay, sir.

41:49.925 --> 41:53.678
Don't be frightened.
You're safe here.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.933
Get on with it.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.601
Sir...

41:59.684 --> 42:05.524
several of us propose an expedition
to start a new warren somewhere else.

42:05.607 --> 42:07.400
A new warren?
Out of the question.

42:07.484 --> 42:11.446
But you don't understand.
The system is breaking down.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.114
Explain that.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.450
Some of us cannot produce litters.
We're overcrowded.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.160
I want no further discussion about it.

42:17.244 --> 42:19.788
- We'll go as far as you like.
- Here or anywhere else!

42:19.871 --> 42:21.206
I -

42:24.793 --> 42:26.628
Thank you, sir.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.381
Campion, have her watched.

42:52.404 --> 42:56.908
That's it, Hazel.
That's where we have to be.

43:12.674 --> 43:15.427
Let me get this straight, Fiver.

43:15.510 --> 43:19.097
- You want us to climb this, is that it?
- Yes!

43:44.247 --> 43:46.249
Come on, Pipkin!

43:57.844 --> 43:59.095
Come and look!

43:59.804 --> 44:02.474
You can see the whole world!

44:12.150 --> 44:14.986
I've found a burrow, Hazel -
under that beech hanger...

44:15.070 --> 44:17.739
with a great hall
and no smell of death or disease.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.408
Oh, Frith on the hills!

44:20.492 --> 44:22.577
He made it all for us.

44:22.661 --> 44:26.206
Frith may have made it,
but Fiver found it.

44:39.511 --> 44:42.972
<i>Yark! Yark, Yark!</i>

44:43.056 --> 44:44.599
Kwee, kway! Kaw!

44:44.683 --> 44:48.103
- I've never seen anything like it.
- it's some kind of a bird.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.896
Are you hurt?

44:49.979 --> 44:51.815
Kah! Kah!

44:53.692 --> 44:56.820
Bigwig, I've got an idea.
See if you can find some worms.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.780
Worms? Me dig for worms?

44:58.863 --> 45:00.782
What for, for Frith's sake?

45:00.865 --> 45:03.868
I get up Plenty soon!

45:04.869 --> 45:06.871
Well, he's hurt, and we ought to help him.

45:06.955 --> 45:09.332
A bird? What for?

45:09.416 --> 45:11.543
We help you.

45:11.626 --> 45:13.461
Piss off!

45:14.045 --> 45:16.798
What for help me?

45:16.881 --> 45:18.800
What happened to you?

45:19.926 --> 45:23.138
Damn cat jumped me.
Farm cat.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.056
We know her.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.310
We take you to burrow.

45:29.394 --> 45:30.812
Go away!

45:30.895 --> 45:34.315
Wing no good, but I walk plenty good.

45:36.317 --> 45:39.863
- Is long way?
- Where you come from?

45:39.946 --> 45:43.366
From big, big water!

45:43.450 --> 45:46.828
My home by big water.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.789
Big water.

45:49.873 --> 45:51.624
Wave go.

45:51.708 --> 45:53.752
Kehaar!

45:54.294 --> 45:56.087
Kehaar!

45:56.755 --> 45:58.256
Kehaar!

46:20.779 --> 46:24.949
You know, I thought everything would be fine
once we got here, but it's not.

46:25.033 --> 46:27.952
Because now we've got here,
I find it's not that simple.

46:28.036 --> 46:31.873
What do you mean?
This place is as safe as Fiver said it would be.

46:31.956 --> 46:34.876
Hmm. I think we've done
very well for ourselves.

46:34.959 --> 46:38.213
- But we don't have any does.
- Does?

46:38.296 --> 46:39.547
Does!

46:39.631 --> 46:42.217
Not one. And that means no kittens.

46:42.300 --> 46:45.470
- And after we're gone, no warren.
- So that's why you went to that farm.

46:45.553 --> 46:48.890
I thought we might be able to get
some of those hutch rabbits to join us.

46:48.973 --> 46:52.727
What's to be done then, Hazel?
Set off again?

46:52.811 --> 46:56.147
But where? There's not been a sniff
of another rabbit since we got here.

46:56.981 --> 47:00.068
The bird. Kehaar.

47:00.151 --> 47:03.530
We'll get the bird to search for us.

47:11.538 --> 47:14.749
What home? This hole?
Where are mates?

47:14.833 --> 47:16.668
Where are chicks?

47:16.751 --> 47:18.878
Mate make eggs.

47:18.962 --> 47:20.880
Me sit on eggs.

47:20.964 --> 47:22.549
Hatch eggs.

47:22.632 --> 47:23.800
Many eggs-

47:23.883 --> 47:25.760
We feed chick.

47:25.844 --> 47:28.137
Egg robbers come.
We fight.

47:28.221 --> 47:32.725
Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah!

47:32.809 --> 47:35.645
You stupid bunnies!

47:35.728 --> 47:37.522
You got no mates!

47:37.605 --> 47:39.607
Where are mates?

47:39.691 --> 47:41.609
Where are chicks?

47:42.360 --> 47:46.114
Plenty trouble for you.
You need mates.

47:47.073 --> 47:48.867
It's working, Hazel.

47:49.409 --> 47:52.078
You got no brains. You no plan.

47:52.161 --> 47:54.455
You need mates for plan.

47:54.539 --> 47:58.793
Listen. I got plan for you.

47:58.877 --> 48:03.882
Wing better. I go ﬂy.
Fly for you.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.676
I find mates.

48:06.759 --> 48:09.470
What a splendid idea, Kehaar.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.931
How clever of you to think of it.

48:12.015 --> 48:14.225
You very fine bird.

48:14.809 --> 48:16.978
When will you be able to ﬂy?

48:17.061 --> 48:19.272
I ﬂy any time.

48:19.355 --> 48:21.107
Stand back.

48:22.108 --> 48:25.153
When I ﬂy - Stand back.
Stand back.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.738
Back, back.

48:27.697 --> 48:29.490
I need room.

48:29.574 --> 48:31.451
Wings good.

48:31.951 --> 48:33.661
Feathers clean.

48:33.745 --> 48:36.164
I soar.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.666
I glide.

48:39.167 --> 48:41.085
I circle.

48:55.058 --> 48:58.061
Then I soar!

49:28.800 --> 49:31.219
Bigwig said
you couldn't make a friend out of him.

49:31.928 --> 49:34.389
He's probably gone back
to that “big water” of his.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.140
I think you're right.

49:37.058 --> 49:39.978
Blackberry, I want you to get Dandelion...

49:40.061 --> 49:42.480
and meet me here
after the others are asleep.

49:42.563 --> 49:44.732
It's no good asking you
not to go, I suppose.

49:44.816 --> 49:47.151
It will be perfectly safe, Fiver.

49:47.235 --> 49:49.237
I'll take the greatest care.

50:03.167 --> 50:04.836
Clover.

50:05.545 --> 50:06.713
Clover.

50:06.796 --> 50:08.256
Who's that?

50:08.339 --> 50:11.259
It's me. We're back.

50:11.342 --> 50:12.844
Hazel.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.769
- What are you doing out there?
- I've come to let you out.

50:21.853 --> 50:23.438
Will you come with us?

50:23.521 --> 50:25.815
We're all right here.

50:25.898 --> 50:28.151
- Yes.
- Good.

51:15.406 --> 51:16.908
Come on.

51:19.327 --> 51:21.329
Come on! Move, move.

51:24.582 --> 51:25.750
Move.

51:30.004 --> 51:31.672
Lucy's rabbits out. Look.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.257
Best get 'em in quick.

51:33.341 --> 51:35.760
There's a wild rabbit. Look.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.262
There he goes!

51:39.305 --> 51:40.932
Keep torch on 'em then.

51:42.809 --> 51:45.561
I don't rightly know, John,
whether you hit it or not.

51:45.645 --> 51:48.564
- I reckon he's in them nettles.
- Have a look then.

51:49.148 --> 51:50.983
Oh, I hit him, all right.

51:51.067 --> 51:52.527
That's blood down there. See?

51:52.610 --> 51:55.947
Ah, well, that don't signify.
He might be a long ways off by now.

51:56.030 --> 51:57.573
I reckon you've lost him.

51:57.657 --> 52:00.660
No, we ain't.

52:01.452 --> 52:04.247
Well, us can't go beggarin' up
and down here half the bloody night.

52:04.330 --> 52:06.374
We've got to catch them
as got out the hutch.

52:37.989 --> 52:41.450
Fiver, there's been some trouble.

52:42.577 --> 52:44.078
Hazel's been shot.

52:45.538 --> 52:46.998
No.

52:47.832 --> 52:50.251
The Black Rabbit serves Lord Frith.

52:51.502 --> 52:54.422
But he does no more
than his appointed task.

52:57.675 --> 52:59.635
Hazel's not dead.

56:19.377 --> 56:22.088
Hazel's been wounded.
The farm man shot him.

56:22.171 --> 56:23.672
Come on. Follow me.

56:25.299 --> 56:28.594
- Come on.
- You get black stones out?

56:28.677 --> 56:33.182
- What do you mean?
- Always with gun is coming little black stones.

56:33.265 --> 56:35.059
You never see?

56:35.142 --> 56:38.729
Take out black stones, he get better. Yah.

56:40.106 --> 56:42.983
Let me see leg. Ah.

56:43.692 --> 56:45.486
Many stones.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.405
Did you find anything on your ﬂight?

56:50.241 --> 56:52.493
- Efrafa.
- Can you guide us there?

56:52.576 --> 56:55.663
Many rabbits.

56:56.455 --> 56:57.957
Too many rabbits.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.835
The whole lot of us wouldn't be enough
to fight one of their wide patrols.

57:00.918 --> 57:02.378
What do you mean?

57:02.461 --> 57:05.756
You see this?
They did it to me.

57:05.840 --> 57:09.510
It's an identification mark.
Tells you when you can be above ground.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.178
What do you mean?
Who's to stop you?

57:11.262 --> 57:13.848
Their Owsla.

57:13.931 --> 57:18.018
<i>Their chief is called Woundwort.
General Woundwort.</i>

57:18.102 --> 57:21.063
<i>I don't think even you'd
match up to him, Bigwig.</i>

57:21.147 --> 57:24.692
<i>Under him are captains,
each one in charge of a mark.</i>

57:24.775 --> 57:27.111
<i>If you're found above ground
at the wrong time...</i>

57:27.194 --> 57:29.488
<i>they take you before
the Council for punishment.</i>

57:30.531 --> 57:32.032
<i>Some of them must get away.</i>

57:32.116 --> 57:35.035
<i>They caught one trying to run away
when I was there.</i>

57:35.119 --> 57:37.872
<i>Blackavar was his name.
When they'd finished with him...</i>

57:37.955 --> 57:40.124
<i>both his ears
were ripped to shreds.</i>

57:40.207 --> 57:42.626
<i>Worse than this one of mine.</i>

57:42.710 --> 57:44.920
<i>He was lucky not to have been killed.</i>

57:45.004 --> 57:48.048
<i>There was another one,
a doe, Hyzenthlay.</i>

57:48.132 --> 57:50.217
<i>I couldn't have escaped
without her help.</i>

57:50.301 --> 57:53.053
- Why didn't she go with you?
- She said she wouldn't go without the others.

57:53.137 --> 57:55.723
Then there are some that might
be persuaded to leave?

57:55.806 --> 57:57.141
Oh, yes.

57:57.224 --> 57:59.477
But you'd never get them out of Efrafa.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.562
Well, you got out.

58:01.645 --> 58:04.940
<i>Only because Lord Frith sent one
of his great messengers.</i>

58:18.871 --> 58:22.791
I didn't see what happened to them.
It must have cut them down.

58:22.875 --> 58:25.961
Well, it's not going to be easy,
but we don't have much choice.

58:26.045 --> 58:27.922
We'll start off as soon as I'm fit to travel.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.382
I don't like this idea of yours at all, Hazel.

58:30.466 --> 58:32.259
Holly, I want you to stay here.

58:32.343 --> 58:35.054
You're known to them
and it could be dangerous for you.

58:35.137 --> 58:38.265
I've been in Efrafa, and I tell you
you're making a bad mistake...

58:38.349 --> 58:41.060
that might very well get you all killed.

58:59.495 --> 59:01.288
There's a homba.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.959
No one is to move.
Keep still, all of you.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.302
What's he up to?

59:15.386 --> 59:17.555
Trying to draw it off, I suppose.

59:20.224 --> 59:22.893
Oh, Frith and lnlé!

59:22.977 --> 59:25.271
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- But what -

59:25.354 --> 59:27.648
- Come on. Hurry!
- A-Aren't you wounded?

59:27.731 --> 59:29.775
No, never better. Let's go.

59:32.695 --> 59:34.238
What was that all about?

59:34.321 --> 59:36.073
I just lost my head, Hazel.

59:36.156 --> 59:39.618
I've been strung up all day
thinking about Efrafa.

59:39.702 --> 59:41.495
Anyway, I feel a lot better now.

59:41.579 --> 59:43.998
Why did you cry out
like that if you're all right?

59:44.081 --> 59:46.500
I didn't. I'd just stopped limping...

59:46.584 --> 59:48.460
you know, ready to run really fast...

59:48.544 --> 59:51.130
when I bumped into a group of rabbits,
face-to-face.

59:51.213 --> 59:55.759
I tried to warn them about the homba,
but all they did was try to stop me.

59:55.843 --> 59:58.012
One of them said, “You stay here.”

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.681
So I knocked him down -
I had to - and raced off.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:03.142
Next thing I heard
was this dreadful squeal.

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:06.312
- So the homba got the other rabbit?
- He must have.

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:09.940
After all, I led them right into it.
But I never saw what happened.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:14.069
it's not to rest here. They come.

01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:15.654
A Patrol?

01:00:15.738 --> 01:00:19.158
Yah, yah!
ls coming for find you. ls close.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:22.411
You go to river, then they not find you.

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:25.873
Come on, all of you, under that bridge,
unless you want your ears chewed off!

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.833
Yah, yah. Come along.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:30.085
By other side, iron road.

01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:34.048
I think maybe they no like
for go across iron road.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.718
Hazel, you go on.
This may be my chance to get into Efrafa.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.303
But it's too -

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.599
All right. Take care.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:46.685
Now Kehaar will meet you tomorrow
in that kale field.

01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:48.729
Tell him then what you've
been able to work out.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:52.900
Mr. Hazel, what wait for?

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:56.236
He's right, Hazel. You must go now.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.823
We'll go down to the river and wait there
until you tell us what you want us to do.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:03.077
What I want you to do is to find some way
to keep them from following us.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.829
Go on now, before we're all caught.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.011
it's a wide patrol.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:23.347
Be careful, Hyzenthlay.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.210
Sir...

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.963
we picked up this hlessi
and brought him in.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.548
Who are you?

01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.634
- My name is Bigwig.
- Bigwig, sir!

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:02.177
What were you doing?

01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:04.346
I've come to join Efrafa.

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:07.975
- Why?
- I'm surprised you ask.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.184
Sir.

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:10.894
Hmm.

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:13.981
ls there anything odd about wanting to join?

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:16.525
I'll ask the questions.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:18.360
What can you do? Hmm?

01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:20.529
I can run and fight.

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.322
Hmm. Fight, can you?

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:23.907
I've been an officer in an Owsla.

01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:28.078
So, you came to join us?

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:31.498
I thought you might have some use for me.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:36.920
Well, for the time
being you'll be assigned a post in a patrol.

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:39.423
You'll take orders from Captain Campion.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:42.342
And if you, uh, want a doe...

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.803
you have your choice here.

01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:46.346
You're not an officer for nothing.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.433
Ah. Thank you, sir.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:53.437
And, uh, you'll be identified...

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.063
by your mark.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:10.078
Those Efrafans will be fast and savage.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:12.539
We have to find a way
to get away from them.

01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:15.959
If what Holly says is true,
we couldn't possibly stand and fight them.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:18.921
Then we'll have to find another way.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.134
What on earth's that, Kehaar?

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:27.429
Him fish.

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:30.724
Hazel, come and look at this.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.309
What is it?

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:36.230
It's boat! Man make them go on water.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.649
It ﬂoats, Hazel.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.152
It ﬂoats.

01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:58.502
Aren't you going to silflay?

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.505
I don't silflay at this time, sir.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:05.551
Tell him why you're here, Blackavar.

01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:09.346
I come here for the mark to -

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.306
I come here for the mark to see me...

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:15.394
how I've been punished
for trying to leave the warren.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:17.479
The Council were merciful.

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:19.356
The Council were merciful.

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:22.651
He keeps trying to run away.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:25.988
Captain Campion caught him this time.

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.448
The Council ripped his ears
and says he has to show himself...

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:33.537
at every morning and evening silﬂay
as an example to the others.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.165
If you ask me,
he won't last much longer.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:41.169
He'll meet a blacker rabbit than himself
one of these nights.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.924
That doe over there -
What's her name?

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:47.634
Fancy her, do you?

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:51.513
She's called Hyzenthlay.

01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:55.684
But I'd look elsewhere if I were you.
She's a troublemaker.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:58.645
The Council's got their eye on her.

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:08.530
You go now, talk to Bigwig.

01:05:08.614 --> 01:05:12.659
Yah, yah.
I go talk to Mr. Bigwig.

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:17.080
<i>He'll</i> be in field by arch on the iron road.
Go find him.

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:19.249
By the iron road?

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:21.209
Yah! I go and find him.

01:05:21.293 --> 01:05:23.503
He'll tell you the plan.

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:26.006
He tell me the plan?

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.799
I know the plan.

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:30.260
Now, don't attract attention.

01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:33.347
Of course -
Of course not.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.933
I be quiet. I be clever.

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:37.517
They no see me.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:42.189
Kehaar. Kehaar.
You wait here.

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.538
Hyzenthlay.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.748
Sir?

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.918
I want to talk with you.

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:05.087
I am in the mark and under your orders, sir.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.589
Do you remember a pale gray rabbit
called Holly...

01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:09.758
you helped escape some while ago?

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:15.347
- You've made a mistake, sir.
- Listen, Hyzenthlay. Listen carefully.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:19.476
I'm from a warren where life is free,
where you can live as you wish.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:23.730
I've come to bring you all out of Efrafa,
as many as will come.

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:27.150
You might be a spy sent by the Council.

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:29.569
You know I'm not.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:32.155
Will you join us,
and persuade your friends as well?

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:35.450
Trust me.
My friends are not far away.

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:41.331
My courage, my spirit -
it's so much less than it was.

01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:43.792
We can escape from Efrafa, believe me.

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:48.880
Yes, I think I do.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.476
- Listen carefully.
- Yah!

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.020
Shh!

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:07.107
We're ready. We leave at sunset.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.067
Ah. Ready. Good.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.444
Shush.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:13.822
There will be lots of us.
We'll meet you at the iron bridge.

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.158
- When?
- Sunset.

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.034
Good!

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:19.619
Good. Sunset.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.621
Then you must guide us to the river.

01:07:24.124 --> 01:07:27.127
- Plenty good trick.
- Trick? What trick?

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:34.301
Listen. If you see a patrol following us,
you must drive them away.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:38.847
- Terrify them.
- Yah, yah. I ﬂy at them!

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.433
- Yah! Yah!
- Shh!

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.852
Remember, sunset.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:45.812
Yah.

01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:48.732
You plenty good fella.

01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:06.500
- It's set.
- When?

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:11.338
Get as many as you can to the near hind mark
at sunset, just before early silﬂay.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:18.136
- Suppose something happens.
- Nothing will happen. We can do it.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.845
Yes.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.723
I think we can.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.560
Sometimes I can tell when things are true.

01:08:25.644 --> 01:08:29.106
Sometimes I can see it.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.524
A high down with trees and -

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.194
Oh, I've become foolish.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:37.572
You'll have to meet this friend of mine.
He talks just like that.

01:08:37.656 --> 01:08:39.157
We'll be ready.

01:08:39.241 --> 01:08:43.370
- Sunset then. And a bird will fight for us.
<i>-</i> A —

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:47.290
- A bird!
- Even Woundwort won't expect that.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.595
Bigwig!

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.809
- That white bird you were talkin' to this morning -
- Talking to, sir?

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:08.395
You were very close to it. Why?

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:13.733
Well, uh -
Well, I-I've never been hurt by a bird.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.734
That's not what I asked.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:20.073
Well, to tell you the truth, sir,
I think I was, uh, trying to impress you.

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:23.868
In future, stay in your own mark.

01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:25.787
- Hmm.
- Sir.

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:29.916
One more thing.
What do you know about a homba?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.585
A homba, sir?

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.670
You led it on to some rabbits.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.423
I didn't intend to.
I didn't know they were there.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:38.591
You didn't report it.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.970
Everything out of the ordinary
is to be reported.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:45.265
Well, I didn't know there was anything
out of the ordinary in running from a homba.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:50.270
Hmm. That was a patrol
on the track of a band of strangers.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.147
Do you know anything about them?

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:56.193
I saw some tracks,
but I can't tell you any more than that, sir.

01:09:56.276 --> 01:10:00.113
I'm taking out a wide patrol tomorrow.

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:03.617
We'll cross the iron road
and try to pick up their tracks.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.870
I want you to come along.

01:10:08.455 --> 01:10:11.041
Yes, sir.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:14.252
Campion, follow him.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.214
Don't let him out of your sight.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:38.526
I've been told to tell you
early silﬂay's been canceled this evening.

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:41.238
No one told me anything about it.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:43.657
Have a look over there and you'll see why.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.828
Now, Blackavar!

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.556
The new officer, sir - he's gone.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.016
Bigwig?

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.853
He's wounded Chervil
and taken a crowd of the mark with him.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:16.147
Embleer Frith.

01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:17.941
<i>I'll</i> blind <i>him.</i>

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.526
I'll blind him!

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.394
Bigwig, where's the bird?

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.438
<i>He'll</i> be here. He'd better.

01:12:00.567 --> 01:12:02.569
Where is that bird?

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:08.742
What I doing here?
I wait for long time.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:12.662
Is no sunset.
ls no good here.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:21.796
Where are they?
They should be here by now.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.633
Silver, go up to the iron bridge
and see if you can find them.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:40.732
They're coming.
Bigwig, the general.

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:43.026
The general!
What'll we do?

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.031
It nearly came off.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:51.117
We'll take one or two of them with us
before it's finished.

01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:53.161
Bigwig.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.538
You traitors!

01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:58.708
Campion, get this miserable group
back to their marks.

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:02.879
<i>I'll</i> settle with you myself, Bigwig.
There's no need to take you back.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:05.882
Come on and try,
you crackbrained slave-driver.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.471
- Aaah!
- Get away!

01:13:13.473 --> 01:13:15.850
Here, I can - Yah!

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:17.143
Get away. Blast you.

01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:21.731
- Yah! Yah!
- Get away, damn white bird!

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.580
Straight ahead, to the river.

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:40.375
Keep going. it's a friend.

01:13:42.502 --> 01:13:45.130
You did it, Bigwig. You did it.

01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:46.881
I did, didn't I?

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:49.426
It's not over yet.

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:57.267
Mr. Bigwig, they come!

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.941
Keep going, down to the river.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:10.113
The general's behind me.
Where do we go, Hazel?

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.534
I trusted you, Bigwig.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.078
You can trust me now.

01:14:17.162 --> 01:14:20.874
You'll either go into the river,
or be torn to pieces.

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:24.711
There's nowhere left to run.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.046
Campion, Vervain.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.258
When I give the word,
we'll go straight into them.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.802
That bird can't save you now.

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:35.555
There it is!

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:08.963
What you do now?

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:11.841
We're going back to our warren, Kehaar.

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:15.929
Good! You go. I go.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:18.765
Is finished here for me.

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:24.312
I go to big water!

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:26.272
Take care of that wing.

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:31.444
In winter, plenty cold. Then I come back.

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.154
Come back anytime.

01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:35.281
And thank you, Kehaar.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.704
Big water!

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:23.371
Get - Get the holes filled in.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.249
Everyone, underground!

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.209
- What's the matter?
- The general.

01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:31.254
- Where?
- The wood behind us. Full of Efrafans.

01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:33.339
- Well, I'm not going back.
- Maybe we ought to leave.

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:34.924
Anyone who wants to can go.

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:38.177
But we went through a lot to get here,
and I'm not going to leave now.

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:40.513
Neither am I.
And if I'm for the Black Rabbit...

01:16:40.597 --> 01:16:43.016
there's one or two from Efrafa
who'll come with me.

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:45.977
We'll fill in the holes good and deep.
They'll have to dig us out.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.438
They can't stay out in the open for long
without attracting elil.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:50.607
You don't know the Efrafans.
They'll never give up.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.859
Blackavar's right.
Maybe we should leave.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:55.278
We're staying.
But there may be a better way.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.947
- Let me come with you.
- No. They know you too well.

01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:59.532
It'll be better if I go alone.

01:16:59.616 --> 01:17:02.285
Now get those holes filled in.
I won't be long.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:11.711
They'll take us back to Efrafa.
Their Owsla will.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.298
Listen. We're not finished yet,
not by a long shot.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.805
You were one of those on the riverbank.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:25.391
Did Bigwig send you?

01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:27.226
I'm a friend of Bigwig's.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:31.147
What was left unfinished on the riverbank
will be finished now.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:35.026
It would be better for both of us
if we could come to terms.

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:36.903
Terms?

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:40.657
Oh, very well.
These are my terms.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.242
Hand over all the deserters immediately.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.078
We couldn't agree to that.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:48.623
But I can suggest something better,
for both of us.

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:50.416
You're in no position to bargain.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.420
We shouldn't be fighting each other.
We have enough enemies as it is.

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:59.300
Perhaps we should be together -
a joining of free, independent warrens.

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.430
Ah, I've no time for this nonsense.

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:07.684
- Shall I kill him, sir?
- No.

01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:10.978
You take back our terms.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:15.775
You tell your chief, Bigwig,
that if he and Hyzenthlay and the others...

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.985
aren't waiting outside
when I come for them...

01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:20.154
I'll tear out every throat in the place!

01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:22.949
Do you remember the rats in the barn?
We got out of that all right.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:25.618
Yeah. Yes, we did.

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:27.704
We-We-We got out of that all right.

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:44.220
They're into the beech roots.
They'll start at this end now.

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:50.977
How - How cold.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.646
What is it?
Are you all right?

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:58.484
<i>I -</i> I'm trying to listen.
Only I can't hear it.

01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:01.571
I'm going away, Hazel.
I'm ﬂoating.

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:05.032
Oh. Cold.

01:19:05.116 --> 01:19:06.200
- How -
- Fiver.

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:09.495
- How cold.
- Fiver, can you hear me?

01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:11.873
Listen.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.711
They've got something down there
that's strange.

01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:19.422
Get out. Get out.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:24.218
They had a great bird
that turned into a shaft of lightning.

01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:28.848
And there was another creature
that took them away down the river.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.267
Here. I reckon we oughta go back home.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.436
- Who said that?
- Nobody, sir.

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:36.522
You were put there to dig.
Get back to it.

01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:39.358
In the name of Frith, stop him, Hazel.

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:40.902
The others are going tharn.

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:42.862
Wake up. Fiver!

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:45.573
- Wake up!

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:47.450
There's a dog loose in the wood.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.287
There's a dog loose in the wood.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:56.083
<i>We need to cross
because there's a dog loose in the wood.</i>

01:19:56.167 --> 01:20:00.546
<i>There 's a dog loose in the wood.
There 's a dog loose in the wood.</i>

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:03.382
Bigwig, I need runners.
Dandelion, Blackberry.

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:06.260
- Hyzenthlay can run.
- Good. We've hardly any time.

01:20:06.344 --> 01:20:09.764
I've got a plan.
If it works, it'll finish Woundwort for good.

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:13.226
As soon as we're gone, block up this run
and get everyone back behind the wall.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.645
- But where -
- Hold them up as long as you can.

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:18.189
- Don't give into them, whatever happens.
- Where are you going?

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:20.149
El-Ahrairah has shown me what to do.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:25.154
Let them go.
It's their chief, Bigwig, I'm after.

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:26.739
Find their chief!

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:46.300
Hyzenthlay, you hide here.

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:48.803
When the time comes,
make sure you get back to the warren.

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.638
<i>It'll</i> all depend on you.

01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:52.682
I'll be ready.

01:20:54.934 --> 01:20:58.855
<i>Lord Frith, I know you've looked after us well...</i>

01:20:58.938 --> 01:21:01.357
<i>and it's wrong to ask
even more of you.</i>

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.193
<i>But my people are in terrible danger...</i>

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:06.654
<i>so I would like to make a bargain with you.</i>

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:09.323
<i>My life in return for theirs.</i>

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:14.203
<i>There is not a day or night
but a doe offers her life for her kittens...</i>

01:21:14.287 --> 01:21:18.708
<i>or some honest captain of Owsla,
his life for his chief.</i>

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:21.002
<i>But there is no bargain.</i>

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:23.838
<i>What is is what must be.</i>

01:21:25.673 --> 01:21:28.175
Blackberry, this is where we leave you.

01:21:28.259 --> 01:21:30.845
Stay close and don't move.
Don't break too soon.

01:21:30.928 --> 01:21:33.514
- Are you clear what's to be done?
- Yes.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.562
General!

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:43.566
Ah!

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:18.851
You lie in the grass, just there,
opposite him.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:23.940
If we meet again, Hazel-rah,
we'll have the making of the best story ever.

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:25.942
And you'll be the one to tell it.

01:23:13.406 --> 01:23:15.866
Can you run?

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:19.704
I think not.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:24.375
I think not.

01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:27.920
Tab.Tab.

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:25.936
I told you once I was trying to impress you.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.480
I hope I have.

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:30.983
And I told you that I would kill you myself.

01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:33.235
There's no white bird here, Bigwig.

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:15.194
Ah!

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:18.280
Why throw your life away?

01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:21.033
Hraka, sir.

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:22.660
Come out.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.205
My chiefs told me to defend this run.

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:28.958
Your chief?

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:31.085
Run!

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:33.546
Run for your lives!

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:34.922
Run!

01:25:50.396 --> 01:25:53.190
Come back.
Come back, you fools.

01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:56.902
- Run!
- Come back. Come back and fight!

01:25:56.986 --> 01:25:59.321
Dogs aren't dangerous!

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:15.254
<i>General Woundwort's body was never found.</i>

01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:21.093
<i>It could be that he still lives
his fierce life somewhere else.</i>

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:24.763
<i>But from that day on,
mother rabbits would tell their kittens...</i>

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:29.435
<i>that if they did not do as they were told,
the general would get them.</i>

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:32.438
<i>Such was Woundwort's monument.</i>

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:36.108
<i>And, perhaps, it would not
have displeased him.</i>

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:53.000
El-Ahrairah knew then that Frith was his friend.

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:56.962
And every evening,
when Frith has done his day's work...

01:26:57.046 --> 01:27:00.758
and lies calm and easy in the red sky...

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:05.346
El-Ahrairah and his children,
and his children's children...

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:10.476
come out of their holes
and feed and play in his sight...

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:13.187
for they are his friends,
and he has promised -

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:14.772
<i>Hazel.</i>

01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:17.942
...that they can never be destroyed.

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:22.029
<i>Hazel?</i>

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:27.326
<i>You know me, don't you?</i>

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:29.203
I don't.

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:33.749
Oh, yes, my Lord, I know you.

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:37.503
<i>I've come to ask if you would like
to join my Owsla.</i>

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:41.423
<i>We shall be glad to have you...</i>

01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:43.467
<i>and I know you'd like it.</i>

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:47.763
<i>You've' been feeling tired, haven't you?</i>

01:27:49.098 --> 01:27:52.601
<i>If you're ready, we might go along now.</i>

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:57.273
<i>You needn't worry about them.</i>

01:27:57.356 --> 01:27:58.857
<i>They'll be all right.</i>

01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:01.235
<i>And thousands like them.</i>

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.196
<i>If you'll come along...</i>

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.407
<i>I'll show you what I mean.</i>

01:28:22.673 --> 01:28:25.801
<i>All the world will be your enemy...</i>

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:28.679
<i>Prince with a Thousand Enemies.</i>

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:32.850
<i>And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.</i>

01:28:35.102 --> 01:28:37.646
<i>But first they must catch you...</i>

01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:41.358
<i>digger, listener, runner.</i>

01:28:41.442 --> 01:28:44.903
<i>Prince with the swift warning...</i>

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:50.326
<i>be cunning,
and your people will never be destroyed.</i>
