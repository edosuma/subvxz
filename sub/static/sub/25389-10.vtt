TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.270 --> 00:04.760
(gasps)

00:04.800 --> 00:05.767
LEO: E| Santo has a guy
who has to vet you

00:05.800 --> 00:06.892
before you meet him.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.828
They call him E| Dentista.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.168
Don't be nervous.
It's part of his process.

00:11.210 --> 00:14.737
Are you aware of the word
moyocoyotzin?

00:14.780 --> 00:18.898
It is time for you to create
yourself, Teresa Mendoza.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.076
Be careful, mi'ja.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.487
There is still
a Judas among you.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.647
Guero? Guero?
Pote, he's not breathing.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.214
Guero? Guero!

00:27.260 --> 00:30.889
(suspenseful music)

00:30.930 --> 00:32.249
KELLY ANNE:
I screwed up yesterday.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.858
I totally admit that.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.925
I want you to know
you can count on me.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.427
You're my only friend left.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.425
(gunfire)

00:38.470 --> 00:40.335
(shouting)

00:40.370 --> 00:41.997
(speaking Spanish)

00:42.040 --> 00:45.203
Hey, hey, hey!
I need to talk to someone!

00:45.240 --> 00:47.834
(both grunting)

00:47.880 --> 00:50.371
You think you're going
to make me beg for my life?

00:50.410 --> 00:51.968
I don't kneel to bitches.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.342
Adis, puta.
I'll see you in he--

00:54.380 --> 00:55.938
(gunfire)

00:55.980 --> 00:59.211

01:00.920 --> 01:02.057
TERESA: (groans)

01:02.090 --> 01:03.887
(dramatic music)

(gasps)

01:05.730 --> 01:09.621
(high-pitched ringing)

01:09.670 --> 01:11.194
(groans)

01:11.230 --> 01:15.860

02:34.920 --> 02:36.911
(baby crying)

02:41.690 --> 02:43.453
El Santo.

02:43.490 --> 02:46.493
*

02:46.530 --> 02:48.555
You?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.761
(baby crying)

02:50.800 --> 02:52.631
It was you?

02:52.670 --> 02:55.434
EL SANTO: You killed everyone.

02:55.470 --> 02:58.109
(baby crying)

03:03.550 --> 03:06.474
You are the Judas!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.613
(pained grunting)

03:08.650 --> 03:10.140
TERESA: Where are you?

03:10.190 --> 03:12.146
I'm at the safe house.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.817
We've almost finished
loading up.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.815
TERESA: And the winery?

03:14.860 --> 03:16.282
Pote's there.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.649
We're gonna deliver
some product now.

03:17.690 --> 03:20.329
Okay, good.
I just got to the motel.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.918
Kelly Anne.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.019
She was using product
and skimming.

03:26.070 --> 03:27.867
You really think you
want her back in?

03:27.900 --> 03:30.607
I know she's been using,
but she's safer with us.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.302
Just want to check on her.

03:33.340 --> 03:35.228
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.341
Bye.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.781
(knocking)

03:50.160 --> 03:52.025
Damn, girl.
You got here fast.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.550
Come in.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.819
I'm just getting, um,
everything situated.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.361
I feel like I'm forget--
Where are my keys?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.868
It's a mess in here.
I'm sorry.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.899
Take your time, okay?

04:05.940 --> 04:07.498
I'll wait outside.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.701
Okay.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.184
(vehicle approaching)

04:29.900 --> 04:32.664
(suspenseful music)

04:32.700 --> 04:34.429

04:34.470 --> 04:38.361

05:06.770 --> 05:10.206
(car door closes)

05:10.240 --> 05:13.175
(engine turning over)

05:13.210 --> 05:16.976
*

05:17.010 --> 05:19.342
(door closes)

05:20.650 --> 05:23.414
Who was that, Teresa?
What's wrong?

05:23.450 --> 05:30.185
*

05:34.630 --> 05:36.928
El Santo's dangerous.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.222
Are you sure you want to go
on vacation with that man?

05:39.270 --> 05:41.158
If they wanted
to hurt me,

05:41.200 --> 05:44.169
they could have done
it at the motel.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.905
There's something different.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.476
Did you find anything out?

05:47.510 --> 05:49.705
Yeah, a contact of mine
in the UK said all Bolivian

05:49.750 --> 05:52.002
product moving in through
Ireland has just stopped.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.176
No one knows why.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.539
Maybe he's working with Camila.

05:54.580 --> 05:55.979
No, he isn't.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.079
Word_ is she's on the run
wrthout any allies.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.009
It's just a matter of time
before she's found.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.482
I need to pack.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.351
Teresita.

06:05.390 --> 06:08.359
Just because you
go in blind...

06:08.400 --> 06:10.721
doesn't mean that you
go in helpless.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.369
It's plastic.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.678
They won't know you have it.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.988
He gave this to me.

06:32.020 --> 06:35.558
It brought me back
from some dark places.

06:35.590 --> 06:38.286
Keep it with you at all times,
Teresita.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.189
Thank you.

06:49.370 --> 06:55.707
*

06:55.740 --> 06:59.141
Listen, I'll be okay.

06:59.180 --> 07:00.579
*

07:00.620 --> 07:02.269
I made it back once, remember?

07:02.320 --> 07:04.743
You won't have me_or_Guero
to protect you this tIme.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.951
I remember me saving
both of you.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.753
*

07:08.790 --> 07:12.021
Just be careful.

07:12.060 --> 07:13.755
Come back to us.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.222
*

07:15.260 --> 07:17.160
I will.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.089
(knocking)

07:40.120 --> 07:41.712
Hey, is this a bad time?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.057
If it is, I can come back.

07:43.090 --> 07:44.887
No, come in.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.664
(shudders)

07:54.740 --> 07:57.607
Did your mom ever read you
the Bible when you were little?

07:59.610 --> 08:01.032
Don't remember.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.672
My daddy did.

08:02.710 --> 08:06.043
I could see myself in
the stories he read.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.947
It was like they were all
different versions of me.

08:08.980 --> 08:09.947
(chuckles)

08:09.990 --> 08:12.242
Sounds silly, I know.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.780
But I could see it.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.288
You know,
all these possibilities.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.790
And the only thing I had
to do was choose wisely.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.060
I think I have a problem.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.624
(dramatic music)

08:24.670 --> 08:28.231
You know, this isn't
the life I was aiming for.

08:28.270 --> 08:31.660
And the drugs,
they paint out all

08:31.710 --> 08:34.577
the ugly parts,
but they don't go away.

08:34.610 --> 08:37.443
They just follow you
around like shadows,

08:37.480 --> 08:39.471
and I can feel them
hanging off me,

08:39.510 --> 08:42.718
and I don't even know
how I got here.

08:42.750 --> 08:46.208
You're stronger than you think.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.686
How do you not just curl up
into a little ball?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.654
Because I never had
that choice.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.726
*

08:55.760 --> 09:00.129
You know, Psalm 144
was my dad's favorite.

09:01.270 --> 09:02.931
It's prettier in Spanish,
though.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.437
Hmm.

09:04.470 --> 09:09.476
*

09:09.510 --> 09:12.206
(sniffles)
Okay.

09:12.250 --> 09:19.247
*

09:32.700 --> 09:36.295
POTE: (speaking Spanish)

09:45.750 --> 09:52.758
*

10:07.970 --> 10:10.939
(engine turning over)

10:10.970 --> 10:17.978

10:42.570 --> 10:45.562
(indistinct chatter)

11:27.420 --> 11:34.451

11:59.850 --> 12:04.878

12:27.080 --> 12:30.379
(classical music playing)

12:30.410 --> 12:37.418
*

12:39.250 --> 12:42.253
(indistinct chatter)

12:54.670 --> 12:58.060
Look at you, sliding your pretty
little culo in there like,

12:58.110 --> 12:59.975
"Oh, don't notice me.
I'm just beautiful."

13:00.010 --> 13:02.103
Who you think you're fooling?

13:02.140 --> 13:04.279
*

13:04.310 --> 13:06.540
Teresa.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.309
Sasha.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.181
*

13:10.220 --> 13:12.245
Do you know why you're here?

13:12.290 --> 13:14.053
Same reason we're all here.

13:14.090 --> 13:17.355
He called. We came.

13:17.390 --> 13:18.982
TERESA: So everyone
here's a dealer?

13:19.030 --> 13:20.429
SASHA: And cold-ass killers.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.826
Oh, don't let
the wrinkles fool you.

13:22.870 --> 13:26.260
The older they are, the more
blood between their teeth.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.690
See, I'm a baby compared
to most of them.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.106
I was running some
third-rate hashish

13:32.140 --> 13:33.676
back in Detroit in '07.

13:33.710 --> 13:37.407
(chuckles)
Thought my ass was invincible.

13:37.450 --> 13:40.214
Got on the wrong plane
with the wrong people.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.810
El Santo killed
everyone but me.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.545
Ten years later,

13:44.590 --> 13:47.479
I'm running all his
supply lines through Morocco.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.284
Turns out I am invincible.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.424
*

13:53.460 --> 13:57.829
TERESA: I've met him.
That's El Dentista.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.168
Now, that's Luca Baron.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.861
SASHA: He runs
El Santo's pipelines

14:01.900 --> 14:03.401
through Rome and Naples.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.738
And the ginger,
she handles Ireland.

14:05.770 --> 14:08.409
You found
a pretty new pet, Sasha?

14:08.440 --> 14:09.839
SASHA:
(growls, chuckles)

14:09.880 --> 14:12.940
Maybe I'll try and teach her
a few new things.

14:12.980 --> 14:14.470
She looks a bit green.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.612
Hmm.

14:15.650 --> 14:18.312
What do you think,
Frida Kahlo?

14:18.350 --> 14:20.011
You up for a good go or what?

14:20.060 --> 14:23.120
I've heard all Bolivian
product has stopped moving

14:23.160 --> 14:25.628
from Dublin and Galway.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.150
Is that true?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.997
*

14:29.030 --> 14:30.327
Hmm.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.329
(bell gongs)

14:34.370 --> 14:36.838
(dramatic music)

14:36.870 --> 14:39.805
No, no, no, no, no, no, sit.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.832
Please.
Mi familia.

14:42.880 --> 14:47.146
I want to welcome you
to my family home.

14:47.180 --> 14:50.411
I promise my words will be few.

14:50.450 --> 14:51.781
*

14:51.820 --> 14:53.981
EL SANTO: Family.

14:54.020 --> 14:58.787
Family is all we have.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.390
*

15:01.430 --> 15:07.994
The most fragile aspect
of our business is trust.

15:08.040 --> 15:14.206
Trust makes one into two.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.641
Two into legion.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.513
*

15:20.550 --> 15:25.385
I've brought you here tonight
to give you a gift.

15:25.420 --> 15:26.819
*

15:26.850 --> 15:31.878
The gift is forgiveness.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.727
*

15:33.760 --> 15:35.398
Forgiveness for what?

15:35.430 --> 15:39.366
*

15:39.400 --> 15:43.632
EL SANTO: Our sanctuary
was firebombed.

15:43.670 --> 15:47.777
These pictures are the only
thing that's left

15:47.810 --> 15:50.506
of that beautiful place

15:50.550 --> 15:55.943
and all of my workers
who make the coca that you sell.

15:55.980 --> 16:00.212
One of you has betrayed
me to the authorities

16:00.260 --> 16:02.285
who bombed us.

16:02.320 --> 16:07.098
And no one here
tonight wnll leave

16:07.130 --> 16:11.590
until one of you confesses.

16:11.630 --> 16:14.599
(projector and lights click)

16:14.640 --> 16:17.609
(indistinct chatter)

16:17.640 --> 16:20.973
*

16:21.010 --> 16:24.275
But first...

16:24.310 --> 16:26.107
we shall dance.

16:26.150 --> 16:29.142
*

16:34.190 --> 16:37.523
(tango music plays)

16:37.560 --> 16:40.256
*

16:40.300 --> 16:42.518
EL DENTISTA: I led you
to El Santo's sanctuary.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.620
TERESA: I know.
But it wasn't me.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.559
I told you to leave
all this in La Paz.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.067
I warned you.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.260
When was the prison attacked?

16:52.310 --> 16:54.278
A week ago Sunday.

16:54.310 --> 16:55.971
They purposely defiled
the Sabbath,

16:56.010 --> 16:57.978
knowing the pain
it would cause El Santo.

16:58.010 --> 17:01.275
This isn't about business.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.140
It's spiritual warfare.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.341
This isn't a battle
about cocaine and cash.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.984
What you are
witnessing here

17:09.020 --> 17:12.478
is the eternal struggle
between good and evil.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.158
Do you know who betrayed him?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.168
Yes.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.167
I believe the Judas--

17:18.200 --> 17:20.191
Doctor Oyola...

17:22.540 --> 17:29.537
*

17:36.650 --> 17:40.017
EL SANTO: Oh, at last.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.757
Ah, everybody...

17:45.730 --> 17:47.891
*

17:47.930 --> 17:53.061
Let me present to you
this beautiful creature...

18:00.110 --> 18:05.377
Her purity is unparalleled.

18:05.410 --> 18:09.870
And I tell you all that
when I am with her,

18:09.920 --> 18:16.052
my heart is like it
is outside my body.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.751
*

18:17.790 --> 18:19.553
Switch partners.

18:19.590 --> 18:20.852
EL SANTO:
Excuse me.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.097
Listen, they just
took El Dentista.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.724
-What?
-We could be next.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.988
This is some bullshit.
I didn't give up El Santo.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.203
Me either.
I have a gun in my room, okay?

18:32.240 --> 18:34.071
*

18:34.110 --> 18:36.431
All right.
I'll follow your lead.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.541
*

18:40.580 --> 18:42.741
Okay, now.

18:42.780 --> 18:45.089
Hold on.
Where do you think you're going?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.940
He didn't say any
of us could leave.

18:46.990 --> 18:48.582
Ladies' room.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.258
-Excuse us.
-No.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.121
*

18:52.160 --> 18:53.696
Well, go on, then.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.597
I know one of you
two's the rat anyway.

18:56.630 --> 19:01.567
*

19:01.600 --> 19:04.831
So who do you think
the snitch is?

19:04.870 --> 19:07.577
Luclq Charms back there
seems damn guilty to me.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.100
Oh.

19:09.140 --> 19:12.109
(suspenseful music)

19:12.150 --> 19:17.782
*

19:17.820 --> 19:19.287
Okay.

19:19.320 --> 19:26.328
*

19:29.600 --> 19:31.465
Dr. Oyola.

19:31.500 --> 19:35.664
*

19:35.700 --> 19:37.065
It's Teresa.

19:37.100 --> 19:40.399
*

19:40.440 --> 19:41.737
-(gasps)
-Goddamn.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.407
SASHA: Are those his teeth?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.974
(frog croaking)

19:45.010 --> 19:46.807
Oh, shit, something just
touched my foot.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.772
(groans)

19:48.820 --> 19:50.811
-No, no, no, no, that dude...
-He's alive.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.442
SASHA: I'm telling you,
Teresa, don't!

19:52.490 --> 19:56.153
*

19:56.190 --> 19:57.680
He's cold.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.152
(gurgling)

19:59.190 --> 20:01.090
Okay, we got to go.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.325
*

20:03.370 --> 20:05.122
My room's up there on the right.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.364
SASHA: Okay.

20:06.400 --> 20:13.374
*

20:13.410 --> 20:16.402
(indistinct chatter in Spanish)

20:24.820 --> 20:26.685
-(door closes)
-They gone?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.483
They're next to my room.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.283
Okay, look,
gun idea's done.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.979
We need to get our asses
out of here.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.258
Okay.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.551
We have to tell the others.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.056
Wait a minute.
No, no, no, no.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.897
You don't know who you're
trying to save, okay?

20:37.930 --> 20:39.727
Those people deal in death,
Teresa.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.169
TERESA: There's too many guards.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.895
Our only chance is
to stick together.

20:42.940 --> 20:46.831
*

20:46.870 --> 20:50.203
(indistinct chatter)

20:50.240 --> 20:51.844
Where the hell did you two go?

20:51.880 --> 20:55.919
Listen, they tortured
and killed El Dentista.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.815
AIDEEN: We're all gonna die.

20:57.850 --> 20:59.249
I can't. _
I can't stay here With you.

20:59.290 --> 21:00.951
Why the hell am I here
with you people?

21:00.990 --> 21:02.150
Get your hands off me.

21:02.190 --> 21:03.919
Get your gobshite hands off me.

21:03.960 --> 21:08.499
Listen, I say we
force her to confess.

21:08.530 --> 21:09.724
What?
No.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.068
I'm in.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.692
I mean, it's better her

21:12.730 --> 21:14.664
than the rest of us
getting killed one by one.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.066
-Did you just see what we saw?
-I'm not gonna go down, Teresa.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.239
EL SANTO: Teresa...

21:19.270 --> 21:21.431
come join me.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.072
Please.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.749
Did you enjoy your little
stroll around my house?

21:39.630 --> 21:42.793
Msica, msica.

21:42.830 --> 21:43.922
Shall we dance?

21:43.970 --> 21:46.393
(upbeat tango music plays)

21:46.430 --> 21:48.534
Hmm?

21:48.570 --> 21:54.577
*

21:54.610 --> 21:57.443
Did El Dentista betray you?

21:57.480 --> 22:01.268
Betrayal?
No.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.141
He is not capable of betrayal.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.044
*

22:06.090 --> 22:08.308
Then why did you torture him?

22:09.590 --> 22:12.423
He was my gatekeeper,

22:12.460 --> 22:15.896
and he let in a wolf.

22:15.930 --> 22:18.125
He was your family.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.468
Yes, Teresa.

22:20.500 --> 22:24.937
But sometimes love is not warm.

22:24.970 --> 22:28.679
Sometimes violence and pain

22:28.710 --> 22:32.806
can be part
of God's greater plan.

22:32.850 --> 22:36.274
You should know that
now more than ever.

22:36.320 --> 22:42.281
Do I detect a darkness in you
that I never saw before?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.083
Hmm?

22:44.130 --> 22:47.122
Is it your old friend?

22:47.160 --> 22:51.824
The one who offered up
his life for you?

22:51.870 --> 22:55.931
I'm sorry, mi'ja.
Speak the truth.

22:55.970 --> 22:58.803
Has the darkness overtaken you?

22:58.840 --> 23:00.137
Have you betrayed me?

23:01.710 --> 23:05.146
She brought a gun
into your home, see?

23:05.180 --> 23:06.977
SASHA: She tried
to get me to escape.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.478
And I told her I would never
betray my family.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.717
She threatened my life.
She threatened all our lives.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.854
Is this true,
what Sasha says?

23:14.890 --> 23:16.289
-No, I didn't do this.
-Mi familia.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.380
Yeah.
Yeah, El Santo, it's true.

23:19.430 --> 23:21.250
She tried to get me
to turn on you, too,

23:21.300 --> 23:23.518
but I told her
to go slag herself.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.662
She's your snitch.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.826
I didn't do this.

23:25.870 --> 23:27.497
(suspenseful music)

23:27.540 --> 23:29.189
EL SANTO: Oh...

23:29.240 --> 23:33.199
I think that we have
found our Judas.

23:34.540 --> 23:37.270
No, listen.
No.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.170
Listen to me.
This is a mistake.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.008
EL SANTO: It was,
but we will fix it.

23:43.050 --> 23:47.419
Teresa, do you know
there are voodoo doctors

23:47.460 --> 23:50.952
who have been known
to control the dead?

23:50.990 --> 23:54.096
By using a combination

23:54.130 --> 23:58.897
of the puffer fish
and toad neurotoxins,

23:58.930 --> 24:04.402
they can induce
a type of walking coma.

24:05.970 --> 24:07.870
_ No.
Listen to me.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.571
This is a mistake.
Please.

24:09.610 --> 24:11.703
I didn't do this.
No.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.705
Hold her mouth.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.240
(gasps)

24:14.280 --> 24:18.512
EL SANTO: Their victims
seem to be in a purgatory.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.780
Living zombies. Abre.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.048
TERESA: N0.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.751
EL SANTO: Abre.
-No.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.678
(grunting)

24:25.730 --> 24:27.322
(engine roaring)

24:27.360 --> 24:28.850
(distant whistling)

24:28.900 --> 24:30.049
No, no!

24:30.100 --> 24:31.988
(screaming)

24:38.910 --> 24:40.730
TERESA: (groans)

24:40.780 --> 24:41.735
(suspenseful music)

24:41.780 --> 24:43.133
(gasping)

24:45.450 --> 24:47.873
(heavy breathing)

24:47.920 --> 24:49.649
(groans)

24:51.820 --> 24:53.811
(distant baby crying)

24:58.830 --> 25:02.789
(baby crying)

25:02.830 --> 25:05.469
You?

25:05.500 --> 25:08.298
You are the Judas!

25:08.340 --> 25:10.831
(pained grunting)

25:10.870 --> 25:12.269
Oh!

25:12.310 --> 25:13.629
(heavy breathing)

25:13.680 --> 25:17.571
EL SANTO: You are the destroyer.

25:17.610 --> 25:18.599
(grunts)

25:18.650 --> 25:22.245
(baby crying)

25:23.990 --> 25:25.946
My baby.

25:25.990 --> 25:28.049
*

25:28.090 --> 25:29.751
EL SANTO: (shushing)

25:29.790 --> 25:33.658
The bomb blast
took my beautiful love.

25:33.700 --> 25:39.889
And those jackals
forced me to cut my son

25:39.930 --> 25:42.296
out of her body.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.308
We were bombed.

25:44.340 --> 25:47.673
(baby crying)

25:47.710 --> 25:50.372
EL SANTO: They're coming.

25:50.410 --> 25:53.379
Your people left no survivors
at the prison.

25:53.410 --> 25:55.219
TERESA: If I were to blame,

25:55.250 --> 25:58.515
I would have left
before the bombing started.

25:58.550 --> 26:00.814
TERESA: So would the others.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.054
What?

26:02.090 --> 26:04.479
TERESA: We wouldn't
bomb ourselves.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.624
It was your fault.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.890
EL SANTO: I was careless.

26:09.930 --> 26:13.832
Why did I bring all
I love to the wolf?

26:13.870 --> 26:15.531
(door opens)

26:15.570 --> 26:18.130
(baby crying)

26:18.170 --> 26:20.035
(door closes)

26:20.070 --> 26:21.708
TERESA: (gasps)

26:21.740 --> 26:24.208
(heavy breathing)

26:24.250 --> 26:25.740
Someone's here.

26:25.780 --> 26:29.375
MAN: Move up.
-(indistinct chatter)

26:29.420 --> 26:31.240
MAN: No movement
over here.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.748

26:36.290 --> 26:37.951
(coughing and groaning)

26:37.990 --> 26:39.821
*

26:39.860 --> 26:41.418
Please.

26:41.460 --> 26:44.020
(gunshot)

26:44.070 --> 26:46.459
Sir, none of these
are the target.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.161
(radio hissing)

26:48.200 --> 26:50.498
DEVON: Get the
infrared drone up.

26:50.540 --> 26:53.259
If anyone else is here,
we'll find them.

26:53.310 --> 26:55.039
(radio clicks)

26:55.080 --> 26:58.641
TERESA: That's
Devon Finch's voice.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.908
(baby crying)

26:59.950 --> 27:00.917
(groaning)

27:00.950 --> 27:03.441
Look at me.
Look at me.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.584
-We have to go.
-(grunts)

27:05.620 --> 27:07.918
They're going to kill us.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.110
-Okay.
-(shushes)

27:10.160 --> 27:11.957
This way.
Come.

27:11.990 --> 27:14.629
I have something
I must do first.

27:14.660 --> 27:17.891
*

27:17.930 --> 27:20.899

to search the property.

Shh.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.613
(heavy breathing)

27:38.650 --> 27:40.959
(baby crying)

27:40.990 --> 27:42.958
Ay, Dios. Mi amor...

(baby crying)

*

28:01.140 --> 28:02.607
DEVON: IR signal received.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.245
If they're still alive,
we'll find them.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.941
Where's your son?

28:06.980 --> 28:08.470
*

28:08.520 --> 28:10.784
My son has his own path.

MAN: Clear!
Try the next room.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.459

28:17.320 --> 28:18.924
Let's go.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.554

(heavy breathing)

28:32.240 --> 28:38.349
*

28:38.380 --> 28:42.578
We must bury ourselves.

28:42.620 --> 28:46.147
This is our only
chance to survive.

28:46.190 --> 28:48.010
The mud won't hide
us completely.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.848
The drones sense the heat.

28:51.890 --> 28:54.688
We have to lower
our body temperature.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.049
-What?
-(water splashes)

28:56.100 --> 28:57.522
How?

28:57.560 --> 29:00.358
We have to enter
the land of the dead.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.890
TERESA: The potion.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.396
That's what you used
with El Dentista.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.307
His body was cold.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.205
There has to be another way.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.004
I wish there was, mi'ja.

29:11.050 --> 29:14.713
I do not look forward
to what awaits me.

29:14.750 --> 29:18.584
*

29:18.620 --> 29:20.508
(groans)

29:20.550 --> 29:23.417
*

29:23.460 --> 29:24.427
(water splashes)

29:24.460 --> 29:26.621
EL SANTO: No!

29:36.400 --> 29:38.766
Adis, Teresa.

29:38.810 --> 29:45.500
*

29:58.360 --> 30:00.624
(drone whirring)

30:05.330 --> 30:10.131
*

30:12.270 --> 30:13.737
(gagging)

30:23.120 --> 30:30.117
*

30:40.370 --> 30:42.998
(drone whirring)

30:43.040 --> 30:44.803
DEVON: We're getting a signal
from that structure.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.104
Move in closer.
It could be the target.

30:47.140 --> 30:50.109
(suspenseful music)

30:50.140 --> 30:56.670
*

30:56.720 --> 30:59.348
(beeping)

31:01.660 --> 31:03.685
MAN: Keep looking.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.120
MAN: Come on. Let's go.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.321
(man shouts)

31:08.360 --> 31:09.827
*

31:09.860 --> 31:11.566
What now?

31:11.600 --> 31:14.967
The drone picked up a heat
signature behind the mansion.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.661
Go check it out.

31:16.700 --> 31:23.708
*

31:28.050 --> 31:29.870
DEVON: You guys
see anything?

31:29.920 --> 31:32.639
*

31:34.790 --> 31:37.782
(dramatic music)

31:37.820 --> 31:41.028
*

31:48.600 --> 31:49.828
Hey, listen.

31:49.870 --> 31:51.337
*

31:51.370 --> 31:55.170
I know you've had it
rough in the past.

31:55.210 --> 31:57.201
But you don't have
to worry anymore.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.838
What's mine is yours.

32:04.890 --> 32:11.284
*

32:14.600 --> 32:17.194
Baby”.

32:17.230 --> 32:20.063
what if we walk
away from this life?

32:20.100 --> 32:21.692
*

32:21.740 --> 32:23.935
Away from the cartel,
away from all of it.

32:23.970 --> 32:26.200
*

32:26.240 --> 32:28.572
Epifanio will never
let that happen.

32:28.610 --> 32:31.579
Maybe I already asked him.

32:31.610 --> 32:33.942
*

32:33.980 --> 32:35.641
What did he say?

32:35.680 --> 32:38.240
Well, he--he said, "Be careful
what you wish for."

32:38.290 --> 32:41.453
But he let me go.

32:41.490 --> 32:45.256
We can start over,
have a new life...

32:45.290 --> 32:46.587
a family.

32:46.630 --> 32:50.225
*

32:50.260 --> 32:52.364
TERESA: (heavy breathing)

32:52.400 --> 32:59.329
*

32:59.370 --> 33:02.407
(water running)

33:06.950 --> 33:12.786
*

33:17.060 --> 33:19.551
(fireworks popping)

33:24.070 --> 33:27.324
_ Ah est. _
Mira eso, cario.

33:32.210 --> 33:36.169
*

33:36.210 --> 33:38.849
Want to go over there
with the other kids?

33:38.880 --> 33:41.872
*

33:41.920 --> 33:44.844
(indistinct chatter)

33:44.890 --> 33:47.939
*

33:47.990 --> 33:49.252
Come on.

34:00.070 --> 34:02.231
Are you reading
any signs of life?

34:02.270 --> 34:03.396
Negaﬁve.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.067
You don't see anything?

34:05.110 --> 34:07.931
No.
Must've been an animal.

34:09.140 --> 34:10.971
DEVON: There's nothing
alive in there.

34:11.010 --> 34:12.648
Search the rest
of the property.

34:12.680 --> 34:15.171
We must find Teresa
and El Santo.

34:22.720 --> 34:25.325
(dramatic music)

34:28.130 --> 34:35.138
*

34:39.210 --> 34:41.030
I wish this was real.

34:41.070 --> 34:43.800
*

34:43.840 --> 34:46.900
Does it matter?

34:46.950 --> 34:48.577
We got another chance.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.544
*

34:51.590 --> 34:53.649
But this is a dream.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.248
*

34:55.290 --> 34:56.951
This isn't real.

34:56.990 --> 34:58.651
Well, you want to go
back to a life

34:58.690 --> 35:00.157
where you have
to fight and kill?

35:00.190 --> 35:01.748
That's not what
I wanted for you, Teresa.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.667
*

35:04.700 --> 35:07.965
There's nothing
for you back there.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.835
*

35:12.870 --> 35:15.805
THE QUEEN: Your life
is painful and ugly.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.900
But it's yours.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.804
And you only get one.

35:21.980 --> 35:24.187
GUERO: You've lost
everyone you love.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.658
I can't stay.

35:30.690 --> 35:33.420
If you let go of this, you're
gonna be all alone out there.

35:33.460 --> 35:38.329
*

35:38.370 --> 35:40.019
I know.

35:40.070 --> 35:42.038
(sniffles)

35:42.070 --> 35:46.803
*

35:46.840 --> 35:48.728
This isn't real.

35:48.780 --> 35:51.442
*

35:51.480 --> 35:53.801
I'm sorry.

35:53.850 --> 35:55.647
*

35:55.680 --> 35:59.081
I love you.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.452
I love you, too.

36:01.490 --> 36:04.186
Always.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.754
(fireworks whistling)

36:11.160 --> 36:14.937
(eerie whispering)

36:14.970 --> 36:19.304
*

36:19.340 --> 36:22.332
(whispering continues)

36:23.780 --> 36:26.772
(gasping)

36:34.560 --> 36:37.154
(gasping)

36:55.910 --> 37:02.918
*

37:55.140 --> 37:58.564
(scratching)

38:03.310 --> 38:08.714
*

38:10.780 --> 38:12.748
The soldiers took him.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.350
My son is gone.

38:15.390 --> 38:17.756
I have caused this.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.884
I am done with this business.

38:20.930 --> 38:24.593
How could so much
be taken from us?

38:24.630 --> 38:28.293
As long as you're alive,
you can re-create yourself.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.558
(heavy breathing)

38:30.600 --> 38:32.465
Moyocoyotzin?

38:32.510 --> 38:34.205
*

38:34.240 --> 38:36.208
Huh.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.208
*

38:38.240 --> 38:39.969
Teresa...

38:40.010 --> 38:44.049
the darkness
that I saw in you earlier

38:44.080 --> 38:46.412
has been lifted.

38:46.450 --> 38:51.456
No, it has changed.

38:51.490 --> 38:55.324
It is no longer your enemy.

38:55.360 --> 38:59.091
We must find the people
who did this to us,

38:59.130 --> 39:02.361
and we must destroy them.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.436
Let's go.

39:04.470 --> 39:11.478
*

39:16.480 --> 39:18.744
POTE: Okay.

39:18.790 --> 39:22.009
500 bucks each.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.288
There you go.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.958
(groans)

39:24.990 --> 39:27.026
I'm in.

39:30.530 --> 39:31.861
(chuckles)

39:31.900 --> 39:34.061
Nah, too close.
Get the next ones.

39:37.170 --> 39:40.901
(laughs) That's what
I'm talking about, cabrn.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.805
Do you feel any pain
in your hand?

39:42.840 --> 39:45.775
Uh, nada.
Not since Mexico.

39:45.810 --> 39:49.109
I'm ready to go if we got to.

39:49.150 --> 39:51.539
You thinking what I'm thinking?

39:51.590 --> 39:53.444
We shouldn't have
let her go alone.

39:53.490 --> 39:54.718
(laughs)

39:54.760 --> 39:56.409
You think you could
have stopped her?

39:56.460 --> 39:58.485
When Teresa gets
something in her head,

39:58.530 --> 40:01.693
it would be easier to stop
a freakin' bullet than her.

40:03.500 --> 40:07.129
I'm gonna get another michelada.
You want one?

40:07.170 --> 40:08.660
Yeah, sure.

40:08.700 --> 40:12.238
Well, it was good doing
business with you, cabrn.

40:12.270 --> 40:13.669
(laughs)

40:13.710 --> 40:15.268
-Hey.
-What?

40:15.310 --> 40:17.505
Don't forget that
thousand bucks you owe me.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.246
What thousand bucks?

40:19.280 --> 40:21.271
(gunfire)

40:22.520 --> 40:23.771
Yeah.

40:27.450 --> 40:29.179
Cabrn.

40:33.930 --> 40:36.728
(cell phone vibrating)

40:36.760 --> 40:38.318
Diga.

40:38.360 --> 40:39.998
Hey, it's me.

40:40.030 --> 40:41.327
Finally.
Where you been?

40:41.370 --> 40:42.530
I'm on my way back.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.197
Are you alone?

40:44.240 --> 40:45.559
*

40:45.610 --> 40:47.032
What happened down there?

40:47.070 --> 40:49.231
We may have lost our supply.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.430
Puta madre.

40:51.480 --> 40:55.041
We have a rat.
Someone gave up El Santo.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.911
They put a tracker
in Guero's necklace,

40:56.950 --> 40:59.248
and Devon Finch used it
to track me here.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.111
Devon Finch?
You don't think...

41:02.160 --> 41:03.354
*

41:03.390 --> 41:05.119
POTE: James?

41:05.160 --> 41:07.082
I don't know.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.098
But we have a mole.

41:09.130 --> 41:15.933
*

41:24.850 --> 41:27.808
(dramatic music)

41:27.850 --> 41:34.858
*

41:37.820 --> 41:38.889
(film reel whirring)

41:38.930 --> 41:41.819
(keys clacking, bell dings)
