00:02.001 --> 00:03.368
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.452
Council of Wells.

00:04.546 --> 00:06.503
Some of the brightest minds
in all the multi-verse.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.549
There's still another cryogenic
anomaly in my DNA.

00:09.635 --> 00:10.796
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.924
The more I try to use my brain,
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.137
<i>I know what DeVoe's doing.</i>

00:15.224 --> 00:17.716
Separate satellites working together
for a single purpose?

00:17.809 --> 00:20.017
DeVoe wants to remove the
intelligence of everyone on Earth?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.093
Just like mine.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.813
Iris?

00:33.283 --> 00:34.740
Sorry, babe.
Go back to sleep.

00:46.838 --> 00:47.828
Iris.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.004
All right. Just...

00:49.091 --> 00:50.332
Just one second. Let me just...

00:50.759 --> 00:53.752
Let me just get this
last sentence done, okay?

00:53.845 --> 00:55.802
Why are you still awake?
What is all this?

00:55.889 --> 01:00.259
This is every file, every report,
every footnote

01:00.352 --> 01:01.388
that I could find on DeVoe.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.219
I dug it all up when I woke up
in the middle of the night.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.728
I just... I couldn't stop thinking
about DeVoe and his machine,

01:07.818 --> 01:09.184
and now that he has
all of the satellites,

01:09.278 --> 01:11.190
I mean, he could turn on the machine
at any point.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.067
And not knowing is maddening,

01:13.156 --> 01:15.273
but at least I know
what he's planned, right?

01:15.367 --> 01:17.529
But everyone else in the city,
they are oblivious.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.739
Which is why I decided that
I need to write a piece about it.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.535
- An article?
- Exposing every single detail

01:26.628 --> 01:28.119
- of his maniacal plan.
- Um...

01:28.213 --> 01:31.001
I think that if people in this city
knew what he was up to,

01:31.091 --> 01:32.627
then maybe they could
protect themselves.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.335
Barry, I really think
this is exactly what we need

01:35.429 --> 01:36.636
to change the tide against DeVoe.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.131
So, I'm gonna go upstairs,
I'm gonna take a shower,

01:39.224 --> 01:40.931
and when I come back, I need you
to tell me everything you know

01:41.018 --> 01:44.557
about that flying chair
and how he uses it to body hop and...

01:52.738 --> 01:55.151
So, last night, Harry,
Cisco and I were up all night

01:55.240 --> 01:57.027
running all the different algorithms
we could think of

01:57.117 --> 01:58.983
involving the satellite tech
that DeVoe stole.

01:59.077 --> 02:02.320
We think DeVoe plans to position
each of his five satellites

02:02.414 --> 02:04.326
at specifically calculated points
around the globe.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.624
And when the quantum computers
in each satellite link up...

02:06.710 --> 02:11.330
He'll use that network to basically
emit a series of dark matter bursts.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.335
That will reboot the prefrontal cortex

02:13.425 --> 02:15.166
of every man, woman and child
on this Earth.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.343
Well, we need
to nip this in the bud.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.091
We can't let him launch
those satellites.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.635
Yeah, but I mean, how are we
supposed to find him?

02:21.725 --> 02:23.057
I mean, we haven't been able to register

02:23.143 --> 02:25.135
DeVoe's pocket dimension energy
for days.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.971
And with Null's gravitational powers
he can launch these satellites

02:28.065 --> 02:29.727
from any place at any time.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.390
Yeah, he can.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.817
What are you thinking, Barr?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.436
I think we shoot 'em down.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.646
- Whoa.
- There is one small problem.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.902
DeVoe has Kilg%re's powers.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.030
Yeah, he can manipulate
any tech-based weapon we fire at him.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.406
So, we don't use tech.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.831
We use some kind of
organic matter weapon.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.624
Right. Like a...

02:50.003 --> 02:50.993
Like a...

02:51.088 --> 02:54.422
You know what, let's split up,
see what we can find.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.710
Ramon.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.889
DeVoe's not acting.
Why is he not acting?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.683
I don't know, but it doesn't matter.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.886
But it does matter.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.515
Oh, and if I had my intelligence,

03:09.606 --> 03:10.687
I could figure that out.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.140
But I don't. I gotta get it back.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.476
No, no, no.
What you need to do is be patient.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.277
We're consulting with, like,
literally every scientist we know.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.400
Will you consult with me?

03:18.573 --> 03:22.658
- Harry...
- No, not... not dumb me.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.734
The other mes.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.654
The Council?

03:27.082 --> 03:29.540
So, I must admit
I found your transmission

03:29.626 --> 03:31.834
intriguing to say the least.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.910
But first,

03:33.755 --> 03:36.498
I have a question for you, Harry Wells.

03:37.426 --> 03:41.545
Tell me, Harry, how did your
"hypothetical" thinking cap

03:42.180 --> 03:46.174
account for the resonant inductive
coupling of the dark matter transfer?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.685
- Well...
- The inductive coupling...

03:49.813 --> 03:51.395
Am I speaking to you? I cannot remember.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.688
Oh, wait. I'm not.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.807
Little guy they must call "Cisco,"

03:54.901 --> 03:56.813
put you in a box,
put the box in the pocket.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.439
Talking to Harry. Simple question.

03:58.530 --> 04:02.524
How does it account
for the resonant coupling?

04:04.119 --> 04:05.109
It, uh...

04:06.371 --> 04:08.863
Ah!

04:09.166 --> 04:11.078
I knew it. He doesn't know.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.246
He doesn't know.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.084
Oh! Simple Harry
is truly Simple Harry now.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.336
No, that's not what's happening.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.918
<i>Ja.</i> Remember I put you in a box,
put the box in the pocket.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.595
Crushed the box in the pocket.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.217
This is very simple, what has happened,

04:26.308 --> 04:28.846
your "hypothetical" thinking cap
has malfunctioned

04:29.644 --> 04:34.264
and left a Wells, a once formidable
intellect, a dumdum.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.062
- That's not what happened.
- Yeah, that's what happened.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.734
That's what happened.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.061
Poor Harry.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.521
<i>- Herr</i> Wells.
<i>- Ja.</i>

04:42.616 --> 04:44.528
Are you gonna help us or not?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.694
- Not.
- Why not?

04:47.996 --> 04:51.706
The Council of Wells is a council
of superior intellects

04:51.792 --> 04:56.503
there to accept the challenge
of others with superior intellects.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.831
It's called the "Council of Wells,"
and not the "Council of Dumdums!"

04:59.925 --> 05:01.291
- Look at this man.
- I see him.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.625
Is he not one of your own?

05:02.928 --> 05:05.420
Are you telling me that you're gonna
betray one of your own

05:05.514 --> 05:09.679
because he doesn't meet some
arbitrary intellectual standard?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.137
So you do understand.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.060
<i>Ja,</i> unlike your simple friend,

05:13.146 --> 05:15.058
here's what you now must consider.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.228
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

05:19.361 --> 05:20.693
He's right.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.061
I am a dumdum.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.021
Hey, you are not a dumdum.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.072
Ramon, come on. Let's face facts.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.116
I've lost most of my science,
lost most of my math.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.193
Language will be next,

05:29.287 --> 05:30.323
and there's nothing we can do about it.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.746
On the contrary, <i>mon frere.</i>

05:32.833 --> 05:35.246
We're the ones who created that
council of dingdongs

05:35.335 --> 05:37.327
in the first place,
so if they're not gonna help us,

05:38.255 --> 05:39.791
that leaves us with one other option.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.166
A new council. A smarter council.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.546
A better council.

05:47.889 --> 05:48.970
<i>Hey, Caitlin.</i>

05:49.766 --> 05:51.553
Do you have any ibuprofen?

05:51.643 --> 05:55.512
Reading up on all this organic matter
is giving me an organic migraine.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.388
Thanks.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.184
You have a little...

06:01.403 --> 06:02.894
Oh, acupuncture.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.197
Ever since I found out I still have
a cryogenic anomaly in my DNA,

06:06.283 --> 06:08.946
I've been doing every medical avenue
I can think of

06:09.286 --> 06:10.697
to get Killer Frost to emerge.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.528
Mmm. You really do miss her, don't you?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.538
Yeah. Killer Frost was a part of me,

06:14.624 --> 06:16.206
and just as I was starting
to accept her,

06:16.293 --> 06:17.500
she was taken away.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.414
I'm running out of ideas.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.714
Hmm. Well, I know
it's not exactly the same,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.713
but I've had my fair share
of missing persons cases.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.294
And what do you do
when you've hit a wall?

06:28.889 --> 06:32.132
I try to attack it from
a different direction.

06:32.684 --> 06:33.674
If that helps.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.141
Anyway, thanks.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.018
<i>We've been attacking this
from the wrong direction.</i>

06:44.905 --> 06:47.147
We know we need a tech-free projectile

06:47.240 --> 06:48.606
to stop DeVoe's satellites.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.111
We've been looking for an object

06:50.201 --> 06:52.284
when what we really need is a person.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.200
Amunet.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.452
- Amunet Black?
- I know she's not the ideal choice,

06:57.542 --> 06:59.829
but Amunet's psychic-powered
alnico shards

06:59.920 --> 07:01.456
are not only deadly powerful,

07:01.546 --> 07:04.289
they're completely immune
to DeVoe's Kilg%re powers.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.546
Not ideal? I mean, she kidnapped you.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.593
She tried to sell me into meta slavery.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.420
And she ruined my bachelorette party.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.504
- I mean...
- That's not...

07:12.599 --> 07:14.386
I mean, you're right.
It's admittedly not as big of a deal,

07:14.476 --> 07:15.466
but you know what I'm saying.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.971
Yeah, we can't partner up with Amunet.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.052
She's a criminal.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.304
Snart's a criminal, so is Killer Frost.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.559
We worked with them.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.186
All right, look...

07:23.443 --> 07:26.277
Look, even if we forgave Amunet
for everything she's done...

07:26.363 --> 07:27.524
Which is a lot.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.527
What makes you say
she'd be willing to help us?

07:30.617 --> 07:33.030
I've seen a different side of her.
She's helped me before,

07:33.119 --> 07:34.826
and I believe she'll do it again.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.216
This isn't what I expected
Amunet's hideout to look like.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.012
I might have made a few changes.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.342
- What...
- Really, boys?

07:59.854 --> 08:02.597
You're trying to get us killed?
That's the Flash, you morons.

08:02.691 --> 08:05.354
And Caitlin may look like a librarian,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.477
but she's a coldhearted beast.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.606
Where's Amunet?

08:08.947 --> 08:09.937
Really?

08:10.407 --> 08:14.242
No "Hello, Norvok, how you been?"

08:14.661 --> 08:17.574
You're not even gonna introduce me
to your new boss?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.451
I'm not her boss, I'm just a friend.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.157
Well, isn't that sweet.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.249
Norvok, where is Amunet?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.123
No one's heard a peep from her
in months.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.669
For all I know,

08:26.756 --> 08:28.622
the witch is dead.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.801
So, Amunet's gone?

08:36.890 --> 08:39.975
Well, apparently, after her deal with
Warden Wolfe took a nosedive,

08:40.061 --> 08:41.677
she's been out of
the meta trafficking business.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.520
Caitlin, you know any personal details

08:43.606 --> 08:44.596
that can help us track her down?

08:44.733 --> 08:45.723
Ooh, I don't know.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.731
Amunet's always been a private person,
sort of unpredictable and rash.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.029
Kind of fly by the seat of your pants.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.282
You know, when she kidnapped me
at Christmas,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.950
she said she used to be
a flight attendant.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.278
I think she was on an airplane

08:58.371 --> 08:59.907
the night
the particle accelerator exploded.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.990
Okay, that we can work with. Let's see.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.665
Yeah, looks like there were
35 flights in the air in Central City

09:06.755 --> 09:08.462
the night of
the particle accelerator explosion.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.547
Cisco, can you access
the flight manifests?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.250
Yes, I can,
and I can take the crew's credentials...

09:13.344 --> 09:14.960
Cross reference them
in the facial recognition?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.262
Can you not read my mind?

09:16.347 --> 09:17.337
I didn't, um...

09:19.017 --> 09:21.555
- Ah.
- Her real name is Leslie Jocoy?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.311
Maybe she's operating under
her real name, not her pseudonym.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.513
Well, she didn't have a criminal record

09:25.607 --> 09:27.223
until the particle accelerator,

09:27.776 --> 09:28.892
so it's not a bad plan.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.858
C.C.P.D.'s database has several prior
work addresses for Leslie Jocoy.

09:32.947 --> 09:33.983
All right, let's pay them all a visit.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.190
Okay. Dad, why don't you and Caitlin

09:35.283 --> 09:36.490
go and check out
the most recent address?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.400
- I'll check out the rest.
- Sounds like a plan.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.862
And I should get back to the loft.
I need to pick up the DeVoe file

09:40.997 --> 09:42.238
- for my article...
- Hey, actually, um,

09:42.332 --> 09:44.494
can I, um,
just talk to you really quick?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.826
Uh, yeah, okay.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.627
<i>Just about your article.</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:50.454
I just think maybe

09:50.548 --> 09:53.541
telling everybody about
a meta-human uber-genius

09:53.676 --> 09:56.214
who plans on rebooting
people's brains...

09:56.471 --> 09:57.587
Yeah, but if we don't tell them,

09:57.680 --> 09:59.296
they might find out when it's too late.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.217
Sure, but I don't... I mean,
the team's always liked to keep

10:02.310 --> 10:03.517
what we're working on low-key.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.262
Okay, well, I'll run the idea by them.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.598
No. I don't mean no, I just mean...

10:08.775 --> 10:11.017
Maybe hold off until
you finish writing it.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.066
Okay, yeah, I'll hold off.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.734
- You will?
- Yeah.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.856
No, I mean, I get it.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.364
We've never openly shared this kind
of information with the city before...

10:20.453 --> 10:21.819
- Right.
- And the team will be

10:21.913 --> 10:22.903
more likely to agree with me

10:22.997 --> 10:25.535
if I have a full article ready
for them to read, so...

10:26.292 --> 10:27.658
I'm gonna hurry up and finish it.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.577
- Okay.
- Thanks.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.214
Harry, I give to you

10:34.467 --> 10:36.959
the emotionally astute
Council of Harrisons.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.260
- Hey.
- There you are.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.005
H. Wells, what are you doing here?

10:41.182 --> 10:42.343
Those other stiffs,

10:42.684 --> 10:45.267
well, they got tired of my connections.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.396
Making me tardy to their party, so...

10:48.481 --> 10:49.562
They gave me the boot.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.940
Give you the...
Wait, so I'm not the only one?

10:52.193 --> 10:54.310
Nuh-uh. All of us have been kicked out.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.854
All of you have been...

10:56.990 --> 10:58.356
You got me a council of rejects.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.690
Oh, they're brilliant rejects.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.821
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Who you calling rejects?

11:01.911 --> 11:03.994
Hey, look at this guy.
What are you? <i>Stunad?</i>

11:04.539 --> 11:06.747
Allow myself to introduce myself.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.827
- Sunny Wells, Earth-24...
- At your service.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.458
They call me "Sunny" on account
of my sunny disposition.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.756
You know what,
I think that name kind of works for him.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.254
The guy who must be Cisco. Hey.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.840
My motto, personally?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.637
For me, my motto,

11:22.724 --> 11:23.714
"Be kind.

11:24.726 --> 11:25.716
"Rewind."

11:26.728 --> 11:27.844
"Be kind. Rewind"?

11:27.937 --> 11:29.053
They're still on VHS.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.013
What?

11:31.107 --> 11:33.440
Hello, yes. <i>Bonjour.</i>

11:33.693 --> 11:36.811
So, I am Harrison H.P. Wells

11:36.905 --> 11:38.021
of the Earth-<i>vingt cinq.</i>

11:38.239 --> 11:41.528
So, I must say that it warms me

11:41.701 --> 11:44.990
to see us all bonded by our faces
and our hearts.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.069
See his scarf? I like that scarf.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.414
I'm gonna get myself one of them
classy scarfs like this guy.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.536
That's a $10 scarf right there.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.585
So, anyway, without further ado,

11:53.671 --> 11:56.459
it's time for me
to commence this meeting

11:56.549 --> 11:59.087
with one of my poems, so, <i>allez.</i>

11:59.510 --> 12:01.126
"I never knew you.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.845
"I never taste you."

12:02.931 --> 12:03.921
Taste...

12:04.015 --> 12:05.096
"I never smell you.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.181
"Until I do.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.306
"And now, I am hookted."

12:10.688 --> 12:13.146
Mmm. Saucy.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.232
And, uh, what is this poem about?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.185
- Bread.
- Ah, deep connection.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.316
Food can...
feed the soul.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.739
You know, I once had this experience
with a hot apple pie...

12:22.825 --> 12:25.442
Okay, you know what,
that's enough, uh, sharing

12:25.536 --> 12:26.947
from this side of the table.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.576
How about we let somebody else share?
Harry, you have the floor.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.656
- No chance.
- Harry.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.740
- No way.
- Come on.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.041
- Come on.
- Do the intro.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.159
Why? No.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.624
- I'm not gonna... What?
- Harry.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.007
You have to do the sharing
if you want the helping. Okay?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.083
<i>Allez,</i> Harry.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.793
Hey.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.013
- I'm Harry.
- How you doing, Harry?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.136
<i>- Bonjour,</i> Harry.
- Howdy, Harry.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.467
We know his name.

12:49.894 --> 12:50.884
So, uh...

12:51.562 --> 12:52.552
Here's the thing.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.181
I'm losing my intelligence.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.732
- Whoa!
- Oh, no.

12:56.985 --> 13:01.070
And as Wellses, you know how
very important our intelligence is,

13:01.197 --> 13:04.361
and so I'm asking for your help
to get my intelligence back,

13:04.450 --> 13:05.941
so I can kick some...

13:06.035 --> 13:07.947
So I can help my team.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.116
- Will you help me do that?
<i>- Non.</i>

13:10.623 --> 13:12.410
<i>Non, mais...</i> Of course, Harry.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.202
Of course, we will help him.
We will help you. Open your heart.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.703
We'll open your mind.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.292
Come on, let's do this.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.416
- Okay.
- Lovely.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.056
Hey, Barr, we're at the market.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.133
We'll let you know if we find her.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.181
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Amunet used to work here?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.058
What did she do? Bag groceries?

13:35.231 --> 13:37.018
At least it's not human trafficking.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.808
Let's look around.

13:42.488 --> 13:46.607
Hey, look, when I told you
to look in a different direction

13:46.743 --> 13:48.359
to find your alter ego,

13:48.953 --> 13:51.445
I didn't mean team up with a criminal.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.996
I know how that probably looks.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.449
Yeah, it looks like you want us
to work with Amunet Black

13:55.543 --> 13:57.409
so she can help you with
your Killer Frost problem.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.709
I mean, why weren't you up front
with the team about that?

14:00.798 --> 14:03.165
Because I thought they'd say no
if I had my own reasons.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.922
And besides, I actually really do think

14:06.012 --> 14:07.378
Amunet can help us

14:07.472 --> 14:09.213
and help me with
my Killer Frost problem.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.923
Well, how exactly can she help you?

14:11.184 --> 14:14.143
Last year when I was having trouble
getting a handle on Killer Frost,

14:14.228 --> 14:15.218
I went to her.

14:15.313 --> 14:18.806
She used a black market
piece of tech on me, a splicer,

14:18.900 --> 14:20.061
helped me split Killer Frost.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.562
So you're hoping
she still has this tech.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.185
It worked before, it can work again.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.111
Well, Caitlin, you gotta tell the team.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.087
Damn.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.923
- Somebody saw <i>Molly's Game.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.602
Hang on a second.

15:03.945 --> 15:07.734
C.C.P.D.! This is an illegal operation.
Everybody out of the room.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.821
Leslie.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.444
Caity.

15:15.456 --> 15:20.076
Leave it to your crafty little brain
to figure out my dark secret.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.494
What are you doing here?

15:21.587 --> 15:22.703
Calling your bluff.

15:22.797 --> 15:23.913
I knew you were still alive.

15:24.882 --> 15:25.998
No one could kill me.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.833
What's with the accent?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.714
It's part of my disguise.

15:29.804 --> 15:30.965
Had to blend in.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.799
Now I'm just your average American
blonde making an honest living.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.633
Well,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.183
a more honest living, yeah?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.897
Besides, you know what they say,

15:43.317 --> 15:45.525
"A zebra never changes it's stripes."

15:46.279 --> 15:47.269
Flash.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.401
Oh! Flash.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.116
You really do stop all the crime
in the city, don't you?

15:55.830 --> 15:56.866
But not today.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.004
I'm not here to fight.

16:15.808 --> 16:16.798
We need your help.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.148
Oh, look, a little hidey-hole
for your outfit.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.817
Hi, excuse me.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.521
You don't seem too concerned
that DeVoe is about to launch

16:30.615 --> 16:32.151
a bunch of satellites into space

16:32.241 --> 16:33.652
that are going to reset
all of our brains.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.486
Oh, no, my dear.
I find it very troubling.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.447
The professor turning everyone
in the world into a dimwit

16:39.540 --> 16:40.872
is tragic.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.585
It's brilliant, but tragic.

16:44.962 --> 16:45.998
So, will you work with us?

16:46.547 --> 16:47.628
Help us stop DeVoe?

16:47.965 --> 16:48.955
Just...

16:50.384 --> 16:53.502
That thing...
Why do you still have it on?

16:54.472 --> 16:55.883
My...

16:56.891 --> 16:58.598
It helps me protect my identity.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.810
No, it's doing
a terrible job.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.603
What?

17:03.689 --> 17:06.853
Yeah, you see that stoic jaw line,

17:07.777 --> 17:09.608
patrician profile.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.480
You're so obviously the speedster
I tried to procure

17:13.574 --> 17:14.564
from the Warden.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.657
May he RIP.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.656
Come on.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.740
Yeah, I'm doing it.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.166
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.463
To think I had the Flash in my grasp.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.170
What a pretty penny I could have
gotten for that sale.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.755
- Amunet.
- Yes?

17:37.848 --> 17:38.838
Focus.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.428
Okay, so...

17:41.894 --> 17:45.353
On the one hand,
I am more dictator than team player.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.480
But on the other,

17:47.817 --> 17:52.812
Professor DeVoe stupefying the planet
would be bad for business.

17:53.823 --> 17:54.813
So, I'll do it.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.199
Unfortunately, there is a but.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.114
There usually is one.

18:00.204 --> 18:05.165
You see, in life I have found
that bigger isn't always better.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.538
But in this case...

18:07.628 --> 18:10.416
You need more shards to take out
something the size of a satellite.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.496
So where'd you get those?

18:12.675 --> 18:16.043
From the plane I was on the night
the particle accelerator exploded.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.880
They were in the cargo bay
en route to a military facility.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.553
Which conveniently never made it
to its final destination.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.685
You see, normally I would just
pop down to my storage locker

18:25.771 --> 18:27.182
to grab my big job stash.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.310
But last week, a naughty boy

18:29.400 --> 18:33.064
or girl
or non-binary gendered individual

18:33.154 --> 18:34.895
snuck in and robbed the place.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.446
Well, we should check out
your storage unit.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.613
There might still be some clues.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.817
I think I have an old CSI kit
back at the apartment.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.241
Great. You guys are so good.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.869
Um, sorry, excuse me, um,
where, where are you going?

18:46.667 --> 18:49.000
Um, to the kitchen for a spot of tea.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.703
Why don't I take you?

18:55.343 --> 18:56.629
Mm... Boy.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.591
Oh! You prepare food in here?

19:01.557 --> 19:02.718
It's not very sanitary.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.424
I wanted to talk to you alone.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.393
I didn't just bring you here
to help us stop DeVoe.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.729
An ulterior motive.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.602
How furtive and apropos.

19:12.360 --> 19:16.320
After all, why go through
all the hassle of procuring me

19:16.405 --> 19:18.146
when Killer Frost could quite easily

19:18.240 --> 19:20.778
just ice blast those satellites down.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.485
Killer Frost is gone.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.820
I haven't been able to get her to appear

19:24.914 --> 19:26.450
ever since DeVoe used
one of his powers on her.

19:27.041 --> 19:30.409
Remember last year when I came to you
because Killer Frost was taking over?

19:31.379 --> 19:32.369
You fixed me.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.292
My trans-modular genetic splicer.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.922
I need to use that splicer again.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.930
Caity.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.224
One of the reasons why I was so
willing to help you and your friends

19:46.310 --> 19:51.430
with your professor situation
is because, well, quite literally,

19:52.274 --> 19:54.391
it also benefits me.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.861
But giving you my splicer,

19:58.364 --> 20:00.526
not as beneficial.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.445
What if I make you a deal?

20:03.828 --> 20:05.114
You give me the splicer,

20:05.788 --> 20:08.075
Killer Frost and I
will do you one favor.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.415
Oh, that is a tempting offer.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.871
But unfortunately,
my splicer was stashed

20:15.965 --> 20:17.957
right alongside my additional shards.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.382
In your ransacked storage unit.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.050
Okay, wherever we find your shards,
we should also find the splicer.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.177
- Ding, ding, ding.
- So, do we have a deal?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.971
You'll give me the splicer
as soon as we recover it?

20:29.645 --> 20:31.807
I'll even tie a little bow on it.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.648
Ladies and gentlemen,
hang on to your wigs and keys.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.566
Here we go. Harry, turn to him,

20:36.694 --> 20:38.777
the guy who must be Cisco,
express yourself.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.571
Yes, it's best you commence with
"I feel" statements.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.657
Like, "I feel a yearning."

20:44.785 --> 20:46.151
Or "I feel aroused."

20:47.079 --> 20:48.069
Okay...

20:48.330 --> 20:50.117
How is this gonna make me
smarter than DeVoe?

20:50.207 --> 20:52.790
Hey! Again with DeVoe.
Why are you so hung up on this mamaluke?

20:53.419 --> 20:56.583
I think that DeVoe for you,
this is a guy that has,

20:56.672 --> 20:58.959
well, he is like a leech upon you.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.922
Sucking and sucking and sucking
and sucking and sucking.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.880
And all you are left with is doubt.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.716
I like that.
Nature, red in tooth and claw.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.801
You know, they say to understand
a man's actions,

21:10.895 --> 21:11.931
you gotta understand his heart.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.937
Okay, question.

21:14.231 --> 21:19.602
How do you understand the heart
of a deranged maniac?

21:19.779 --> 21:22.021
The guy who must be Cisco
makes a good point here.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.527
Let's all close our eyes
and take a moment

21:24.617 --> 21:28.452
to imagine we are all sociopaths
trying to conquer the world.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.653
Ah, yes.

21:30.873 --> 21:31.863
What is...

21:34.335 --> 21:35.871
Oh, <i>mais,</i> Harry.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.791
Go on, <i>allez,</i>
put yourself in DeVoe's shoes.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.247
Close your eyes, Harry.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.175
Now, what do you see?

21:49.350 --> 21:50.682
What do you smell?

21:51.227 --> 21:52.843
How'd he feel?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.099
Dumb. Dumb.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.522
This is not making me any smarter.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.191
But aren't you smarter, Harry?

22:00.694 --> 22:03.311
You must channel your aggression
into love.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.234
I feel like you're mocking me.

22:05.407 --> 22:08.275
Oh, an "I feel" statement.
Winner. Winner.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.860
All right. All right.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.536
Progress, on that note...

22:11.747 --> 22:15.206
Wait, wait. We're not done here, are we?

22:15.292 --> 22:16.999
- Yeah. Yeah. We're done.
- Yeah, we're done.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.159
<i>Oui. C'est fini.</i>

22:18.254 --> 22:20.211
No. No. No. Nothing's <i>fini.</i>

22:20.297 --> 22:21.413
Now, Harry.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.464
You know what they say about
all work and no play.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.208
Leaves no time for making whoopee.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.923
And there he goes.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.930
Look, H.P., come on. We're not...
We haven't done anything.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.932
<i>Non, non, mon frere. Desole, huh?</i>

22:33.435 --> 22:36.178
Parting, such sweet sorrow,
but I must bid you <i>adieu.</i>

22:36.564 --> 22:38.476
Harry, from Earth-2, <i>adieu.</i>

22:40.568 --> 22:43.276
Harry, everything you need,

22:43.362 --> 22:47.072
you got it right in there.
Remember, you're unbelievable.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.034
Ramon, remind me again.

22:51.662 --> 22:54.450
What... what's another word for "huge"?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.373
Colossal.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.409
Colossal. Great. Thank you.

22:59.545 --> 23:04.006
This was a colossal waste of time!

23:15.227 --> 23:16.263
Here we are.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.724
This is where you kept
your stash?

23:19.773 --> 23:21.514
Well, I got something.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.398
Some kind of substance on the lock pin.

23:25.487 --> 23:28.070
Looks like they applied it
to break the door open.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.366
Young man, David Caruso's
got nothing on you.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.364
Nice.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.704
What is it?

23:40.794 --> 23:42.877
Acid? Cyanide?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.121
Oh, oh! Is it anthrax?

23:48.302 --> 23:49.634
Hematoxic venom.

23:52.640 --> 23:57.010
That grotty, mangy, plug-ugly brat
dare betray me?

23:57.519 --> 23:59.226
I take it she knows who did this.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.020
Yup, and so do you.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.896
Norvok.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.522
And I guarantee that snake for brains
will suffer.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.740
If Norvok thinks he can steal from me
and get away with it,

24:15.829 --> 24:17.786
he's got another thing coming.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.122
I can't believe this is happening.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.198
Satellite's not picking up

24:20.292 --> 24:22.249
any of your alnico metal
anywhere in the city.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.578
Norvok may be a moron,
but he's not stupid enough

24:24.672 --> 24:26.038
to keep the stash out in the open.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.214
Hey, did you find anything?

24:28.300 --> 24:31.213
Nope. Norvok and the boxers weren't
there at the ring anymore.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.464
Of course not.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.839
Because you and your gang of heroes
tipped him off that something was up.

24:35.933 --> 24:38.175
Have you expanded the satellites
beyond Central City?

24:38.268 --> 24:39.258
Yeah.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.889
What about trying facial recognition?

24:40.980 --> 24:41.970
Yes, of course.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.477
And what about a geological scan
of the metal signature like last time

24:44.566 --> 24:46.558
or having Cisco run another algorithm

24:46.652 --> 24:48.143
to check the electromagnetic fields
in the city?

24:48.237 --> 24:51.025
Yes, Caitlin. I've done all that.
I've run all the tests.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.318
Bit testy with that, Frost, just...

24:53.409 --> 24:54.775
We're doing everything we can,
all right?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.450
We're gonna find Norvok and the shards.

24:58.872 --> 24:59.862
Caitlin.

25:00.708 --> 25:04.247
Is this about her stolen shards
or her tech?

25:05.963 --> 25:07.454
What? What tech?

25:10.801 --> 25:12.258
Amunet has splicer technology

25:12.344 --> 25:14.461
that she used to split
Killer Frost last year.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.263
I was hoping to use it again
to get Killer Frost to come out,

25:17.349 --> 25:21.093
but it was hidden with her metal
shards in the storage container.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.769
Why wouldn't
you tell us that?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.063
Because I made Amunet a deal.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.642
If she helped me, Killer Frost would
do another job for her.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.193
Well, that splicer tech
isn't your only hope.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.487
Yes, it is, Joe.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.030
I have tried everything that
I can think of

25:34.116 --> 25:35.232
to get Killer Frost to appear,

25:35.325 --> 25:36.861
and that was my last shot.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.693
So, now she's gone for good.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.668
Those weirdos
with their feelings.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.215
I'm done talking about my feelings.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.003
What's your problem?

25:57.097 --> 25:58.759
No. It just looked like
you were gonna...

25:58.849 --> 26:00.056
What is this?
What are you doing?

26:00.142 --> 26:01.929
I am cleaning up my workstation

26:02.019 --> 26:03.055
'cause I'm not gonna need it anymore

26:03.145 --> 26:04.852
since I'm not getting
my intelligence back.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.475
You don't know that.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.181
I don't know that?
Oh, I don't know that?

26:08.525 --> 26:10.608
Ramon, what's done is done.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.852
You spent all this time bringing
this council together

26:12.946 --> 26:14.562
when your time should have been used
helping the team.

26:14.656 --> 26:19.196
I wasted your valuable time,
and for that I apologize.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.495
What are you... What?

26:26.585 --> 26:27.917
Did I spill some soup on me?

26:28.003 --> 26:30.086
No, no, no. It's just... That was...

26:31.048 --> 26:32.414
That was very real.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.508
It's like a very, very genuine apology.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.627
Well, I meant it.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.380
I can tell. There's no snark,
you're not throwing anything.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.100
Right. I'm not. Hmm.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.890
The Council might not have
helped your intelligence,

26:46.980 --> 26:52.476
but I think they might have shown you
a little empathy.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.856
You know, DA Cecile Horton said
there's other ways to be intelligent.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.116
"Open your hearts.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.652
- "Open your mind".
- "Open your mind".

27:02.746 --> 27:05.113
It's been so long since I've been
concerned for other people's feelings

27:05.207 --> 27:06.197
that you know...

27:06.834 --> 27:07.915
You know what?

27:09.586 --> 27:11.999
Maybe it is time I considered
someone else's feelings.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.880
- Well, I feel...
- DeVoe.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.503
- DeVoe.
- Right?

27:16.593 --> 27:18.050
Maybe the Council had a point.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.796
And the best way for me
to understand DeVoe,

27:22.141 --> 27:23.473
put myself in his shoes.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.346
- Yeah.
- Is that what you were going to say?

27:26.436 --> 27:27.893
No, I was going to say DeVoe.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.141
- Okay.
- That, that makes sense.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.347
- It does.
- Yeah.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.686
Hey, anything on Norvok?

27:35.779 --> 27:38.146
No, but I do have an update on DeVoe.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.067
It's my finished article.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.407
Barry, look, I'm just as anxious
as you are about DeVoe,

27:48.500 --> 27:52.084
but I really think that we need to
arm the citizens with information,

27:52.171 --> 27:53.161
not shield them from it.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.959
Iris, I mean, I... I'm just...

27:55.048 --> 27:57.381
I'm trying to do what's best
for the city and the team.

27:57.467 --> 27:58.753
And look,

27:58.844 --> 28:01.507
I think that telling the truth
is what's best.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.463
I mean, if we give them
all the facts to consider

28:03.557 --> 28:04.764
they will do the right thing.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.136
How can you be sure about that?

28:06.226 --> 28:07.342
Look, Barry.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.598
I can't deny that you've had
a tough year with DeVoe,

28:13.358 --> 28:17.602
but his entire goal is to take
information away from people.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.360
If we don't publish this article,
we are no better than he is.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.783
All right. I just... This is...

28:23.869 --> 28:25.076
I think it's too risky.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.365
I know that's how you feel.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.995
And I really want us to be
on the same page.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.667
So, it's your decision.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.879
- Iris...
- I just want you to remember

28:36.965 --> 28:38.752
that the Flash is a beacon of hope

28:38.884 --> 28:41.001
that the people have
always put their faith in.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.129
And now it's time for the Flash
to put his faith in the people.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.726
Ah, there you are.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.980
I couldn't help but notice
your anger and hostility.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.812
Thought your color was blue, not red.

29:00.906 --> 29:04.650
Yes, I'm angry. I've been angry
for weeks and still no Killer Frost.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.450
And now, Norvok's ruined everything.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.069
Oh, Caity.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.869
I hate to see you so torn up like this.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.577
So, I'm going to tell you something
that will cheer you up.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.712
That splicer did not cure you.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.340
- What?
- Well...

29:25.430 --> 29:27.672
You'd come to me so broken,

29:28.809 --> 29:30.050
so needy,

29:30.143 --> 29:32.681
and so I put that piece of tech
on your head and...

29:32.771 --> 29:34.387
Poof, nothing.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.434
It did not work on you.

29:38.318 --> 29:41.106
So you decided to lie to me
rather than tell me that?

29:41.280 --> 29:42.270
Mmm.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.985
But just because the splicer
didn't technically work

29:45.075 --> 29:46.907
doesn't mean that the results
were not the same.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.735
How? That doesn't make any sense.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.203
You're the doctor, you tell me.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.033
It's a placebo.

29:55.711 --> 29:59.045
You see,
it's been inside you the entire time.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.375
Caity, your power is unlike anything
I have ever seen before,

30:03.468 --> 30:08.213
and no science kit or placebo
is going to explain why you...

30:11.143 --> 30:12.133
Hmm.

30:13.562 --> 30:14.928
A placebo.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.767
A fake.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.724
What are you talking about?

30:21.737 --> 30:24.275
I know exactly where Norvok is.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.753
We were surprised to get the call.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.006
Shouldn't be. I'm running things now.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.209
Amunet's gone.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.883
But she did leave behind
something very valuable.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.059
Thirty times stronger than steel.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.142
You can assemble them
in any shape you like

30:59.232 --> 31:00.689
and, best of all,

31:01.318 --> 31:04.902
they're loaded with enough
potential energy to flatten a city.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.154
We know where Norvok is.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.076
Just when I though I'd considered
every option

31:13.163 --> 31:15.280
for where Norvok might be skulking,
I remembered.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.536
Whenever the fuzz used to be
on to one of our deals,

31:17.626 --> 31:20.494
I would plant a rumor that it was
going down at a false location.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.330
A fakeout to keep the "fuzz"
off your tracks.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.504
Mmm.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.672
So, that's where we think
that Norvok is.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.250
In the abandoned Randall sub-station.

31:27.344 --> 31:28.880
Underground. That's why the shards

31:28.970 --> 31:30.336
weren't registering on the satellite.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.887
Why don't the three of us
go get your shards.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.464
Then we'll be armed and ready
to take out DeVoe's satellites.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.345
I'm coming, too. I'll get the cold gun.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.971
Oh, goody, a group foray.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.598
Dibs on cashing in Norvok's chips.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.350
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.727
- No killing.
- That was not a stipulation

31:42.818 --> 31:44.104
when I agreed to join this crew.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.686
Okay, Amunet, look.
I... I know how you usually work,

31:46.780 --> 31:49.147
but I can handle this fast
and without any casualties.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.191
Okay.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.361
It is a bit time-consuming to remove
blood from metal.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.345
This deal's off.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.797
Those shards belong to Amunet.

32:13.890 --> 32:17.258
Well, if that decrepit hag
didn't want them stolen,

32:17.352 --> 32:19.344
she shouldn't have told me
where she hid them.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.724
Decrepit?

32:21.481 --> 32:23.598
That's a big word for such a small man.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.103
Amunet, I've got this.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.810
There are some things that a woman
just cannot delegate.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.241
We agreed no killing.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.368
That'll make this next part easy.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.476
Joe, the shards are in there.
We can't let them get away.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.997
Barry, what's going on? Your vitals
are going through the roof.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.328
Venom.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.004
I think the venom in Amunet's locker.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.126
I'm on it.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.761
You are just as vile
as that thing in your head.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.182
Took a while to get this made.

33:44.564 --> 33:47.056
Now you can't use those things
against me anymore.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.851
You always underestimated me.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.065
Caitlin, get back. Go, go, go.
Over here.

34:12.007 --> 34:12.998
Iris?

34:13.092 --> 34:15.130
Barry, there is no antidote for
meta-human venom that potent.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.632
You're gonna have to phase through it
now before it gets to your heart.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.929
Mmm.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.813
I'm running out of ammo.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.516
I think they'll hit me
before I hit them with this.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.981
We're looking at this
from the wrong direction.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.315
What? What are you doing?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.114
Nice.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.090
I've never understood your superpower.

35:36.176 --> 35:39.260
Are you a man with a snake
or a snake with a man?

35:39.346 --> 35:41.212
Amunet, don't kill him.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.638
He's more than earned it.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.465
It's not about him, it's about you.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.133
Caitlin.

35:46.227 --> 35:49.971
Amunet, there is a good part of you.
I truly believe that.

36:04.412 --> 36:05.778
But the snake has got to go.

36:14.547 --> 36:17.210
Like Norvok, I must be on my way.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.836
Amunet, no. Hey.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.919
You leave, there's no way
we can stop DeVoe's satellite.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.755
She was never gonna help us.
She just wanted her metal.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.340
Oh, truthfully, I did consider it.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.428
I did, but a good player knows
when to fold.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.731
And the professor certainly has
a better hand, so...

36:34.943 --> 36:36.855
Don't try to stop me.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.187
After all, I am packing.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.694
There is nowhere you can go that
DeVoe's satellites won't reach you.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.652
If you leave now, you'll be
mind melted just like the rest of us.

36:46.454 --> 36:49.322
Good point.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.786
Just for the record,
this is not me helping.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.663
It is entirely self-preservation.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.426
Filled with shrapnel and bound with
my meta-human <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

37:05.515 --> 37:07.427
Pull a shard, throw it,

37:07.517 --> 37:10.726
it will deliver
one savage concussive blow.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.970
But you only get one shot.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.356
I know you won't waste it.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.938
Go save the world, my darling.

37:41.468 --> 37:42.584
And she's gone.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.008
At least she didn't
leave us empty-handed.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.855
Eye snakes.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.187
Why did it have to be eye snakes?

37:59.277 --> 38:01.940
Trust me, man.
It wasn't as cool as it sounds.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.109
Guys, I'm sorry I got so worked up
with Amunet around.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.190
It's okay.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.527
Yeah, and Amunet did give us
the alnico metal projectile bomb.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.704
I still think it's our best bet
at stopping DeVoe.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.122
We just need to figure out
how to fire it.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.699
- Yeah.
- Cisco, can you breach that thing?

38:14.793 --> 38:18.161
Me? No way. My energy field
can't even reach outer space.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.211
Okay, well we need to find
another solution

38:20.298 --> 38:22.210
and we need to find it before
DeVoe launches those satellites.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.713
Well, actually, thanks to Ramon

38:24.803 --> 38:26.965
and the Council of Harrisons,
we may have an idea

38:27.055 --> 38:30.173
about why DeVoe has not yet
launched his satellites.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.007
He put himself in DeVoe's shoes.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.218
Yeah, I thought,
"Well, if I was this ultra genius

38:34.312 --> 38:36.554
"moving around in a floating chair,
how would I feel?"

38:36.648 --> 38:38.310
You'd feel nothing.
You'd be sociopathic.

38:39.067 --> 38:42.686
Right, but to me,
I wouldn't consider myself sociopathic.

38:42.779 --> 38:46.773
Right now all my actions would be
driven by the one thing

38:46.866 --> 38:50.155
that I care the most about. Right? And...

38:50.245 --> 38:52.282
- So, if you're not acting...
- If I'm not acting,

38:52.372 --> 38:55.615
then I don't have the one thing
that I care the most about.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.075
My wife.

39:03.299 --> 39:04.961
You guys need me
to walk you through this?

39:05.051 --> 39:06.883
No, we... We get it, Harry.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.596
It's kind of complicated but,
okay, I'll take your word.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.719
Actually that took a lot out of me.
I'm gonna go have a nap.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.472
Well, we can work with that idea.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.306
Yeah, I will fire up the satellites,
see if I can find Marlize.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.391
And I'll start figuring out
how to launch this

39:21.526 --> 39:24.485
psychic dark matter-infused
metal shrapnel bomb.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.357
No big deal.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.530
Joe, do you want to get
a cup of coffee with me

39:28.616 --> 39:29.902
before you go back to C.C.P.D.?

39:29.993 --> 39:32.952
I could use some caffeine after today.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.120
I know you don't get tired
of hearing it, but...

39:41.296 --> 39:42.286
You were right.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.332
Well, not about Amunet.
She still betrayed us.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.542
But she knew the truth about DeVoe

39:48.136 --> 39:50.469
and she ultimately made
a selfless decision to help us

39:50.555 --> 39:52.342
by giving us the projectile.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.596
And I do have faith
in Central City, Iris.

39:57.353 --> 40:01.438
Because I know that at the core
of every citizen in this city

40:02.692 --> 40:03.682
is something good.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.063
And I know they'll feel the same way
when they read your article.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.650
Let's tell the team.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.995
Are you sure you wanna do this? You...

40:18.207 --> 40:19.698
You want me to publish my article?

40:19.792 --> 40:20.782
Without a doubt.

40:22.045 --> 40:26.289
We're always stronger, better together.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.462
Kiss me.

40:34.724 --> 40:35.714
Thank you.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.097
Uh-uh. This one's on me. I insist.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.023
Nice. What did I do to deserve that?

40:45.151 --> 40:47.143
That's for giving me the advice I needed

40:47.236 --> 40:48.647
even when I didn't want to hear it.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.230
Well, when you raise kids,
you get used to giving advice.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.357
So...

40:54.661 --> 40:57.278
I was convinced that
that splicer technology

40:57.372 --> 40:58.863
was the key
to getting Killer Frost back.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.664
But I was wrong.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.457
The splicer was just a placebo,

41:02.543 --> 41:05.707
and it tricked me into manifesting
those somatic results that I wanted.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.038
You learned that from Amunet?

41:07.131 --> 41:08.997
Mmm-hmm. I thought the answer
was in science,

41:09.092 --> 41:10.674
but it was never gonna be there.

41:11.511 --> 41:12.501
So what now?

41:12.595 --> 41:13.676
I'm gonna take your advice.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.971
I'm gonna look in
a completely different direction.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.307
The key to finding Killer Frost
is not out there.

41:19.727 --> 41:20.717
It's in here.

41:32.740 --> 41:33.981
Iris, what's happening?

41:34.075 --> 41:36.362
- Barry, it's the city.
- What?

41:36.452 --> 41:38.159
I posted my article
and they're responding.

41:38.705 --> 41:40.492
What do you mean? They believed you?

41:40.581 --> 41:42.447
More than that. They wanna help. Look.

41:46.379 --> 41:49.167
This guy says that he saw DeVoe
at Fifth and Knoll two days ago.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.044
Yeah, and another guy
on Crescent and Tenth.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.341
This is great.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.753
Iris,

41:55.847 --> 41:57.839
this means DeVoe can't
hide from us anymore.
