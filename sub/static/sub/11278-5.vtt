00:06.800 --> 00:09.700
Oh, Knight                      
of the Pentacles.               

00:09.800 --> 00:12.300
I wouldn't want to be in        
your shoes, Mr. Petersen.       

00:12.400 --> 00:15.000
Woody, are those                
Tarot cards?                    

00:15.100 --> 00:15.600
            Yeah.               

00:15.800 --> 00:17.000
What are you doing?             

00:17.100 --> 00:18.900
You have to be careful          
with those things.              

00:19.000 --> 00:22.900
 Ah, yes, the awesome power and 
 dreaded prophecy of the Tarot. 

00:23.000 --> 00:24.200
So ancient and mysterious       

00:24.200 --> 00:26.900
 that no one knows its history, 
          not even me.          

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
          Well, that's a relief.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.200
Woody, you idiot.               

00:31.300 --> 00:33.400
Don't mess with                 
the supernatural.               

00:33.500 --> 00:35.900
Have I taught you               
nothing about bad juju?         

00:35.900 --> 00:38.200
         Relax, Carla.          
     I've done this before.     

00:38.300 --> 00:40.300
      Now, where were we,       
         Mr. Petersen?          

00:40.300 --> 00:42.000
                Have you got any
                Grim Reapers?   

00:44.100 --> 00:46.200
    Nope. Go fish.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.200
      (loud jackhammering)      

02:03.200 --> 02:05.900
                     (shouting):
            Carla, can I have   
                 a beer, please?

02:05.900 --> 02:07.300
(shouting):                     
What?                           

02:07.400 --> 02:08.900
    (shouting louder):          
  Can I have a beer, please?1   

02:08.900 --> 02:09.699
    (shouting louder):          
             What?!             

02:09.800 --> 02:10.699
         (noise stops)          
             Ca...              

02:10.800 --> 02:12.100
        (normal voice):         
Can I have a beer, please?      

02:12.100 --> 02:13.300
          (shouting):           
             What?!             

02:13.400 --> 02:15.100
        They stopped the        
        hammering, okay?        

02:15.200 --> 02:17.600
          (shouting):           
I know, I'm just torturing you! 

02:20.000 --> 02:22.700
        Finally stopped, huh?   
                It must be noon.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.100
Actually, I've only             
got ten till.                   

02:25.100 --> 02:27.300
     Oh, yeah, union guys.      

02:27.300 --> 02:28.600
              Yep.              

02:28.700 --> 02:30.400
      When are those guys       
    gonna be finished?          

02:30.400 --> 02:32.000
 They're killing our business.  

02:32.000 --> 02:33.500
Nobody can come                 
through the front door.         

02:33.600 --> 02:35.000
              That's okay.      

02:35.000 --> 02:37.100
         The foreman promised me
it's just a one-day job, hon.   

02:37.100 --> 02:38.400
    I hope so.                  

02:38.400 --> 02:39.900
      What are they doing       
        up there anyway?        

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Why doesn't                     
someone go see?                 

02:42.000 --> 02:44.200
          Well, it's all the way
             upstairs, you know.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.600
                  Maybe we could
                  call somebody.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.300
Yeah, the phone's               
way over there.                 

02:49.400 --> 02:50.900
        We could turn on the TV.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.600
         It might be on the news
                or something.   

02:52.600 --> 02:54.100
Clicker's in the poolroom.      

02:55.600 --> 02:57.400
                Well, I guess   
            we'll never know.   

02:59.000 --> 03:03.300
If you people aren't the laziest
 beer sponges I have ever seen. 

03:03.300 --> 03:04.600
I mean, if you want             

03:04.600 --> 03:06.900
    to know what's going on     
        out there,              

03:07.000 --> 03:08.500
      why doesn't somebody      
          go and look?          

03:08.500 --> 03:10.200
Why doesn't somebody just get up

03:10.200 --> 03:11.700
     off their rusty-dusty      
          and go look?          

03:13.400 --> 03:16.200
  Oh, hey, maybe I should have  
asked him to return this.       

03:16.200 --> 03:17.900
(Frasier yelling)               
(loud crash)                    

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
         Oh, too late.          

03:20.100 --> 03:22.500
Maybe we should go see          
if he's all right.              

03:22.500 --> 03:24.600
            Aw, it's all the way
             upstairs, you know.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.900
                    So, Fras,   

03:31.000 --> 03:32.300
 what are they doing up there?  

03:32.400 --> 03:33.800
  Well, as near as I can tell,  

03:33.900 --> 03:35.800
 they're replacing the top step 
     with a six-foot hole.      

03:35.800 --> 03:38.200
        (laughing)              

03:40.600 --> 03:43.800
You know, you people wouldn't   
be laughing if you knew that    
I have a severe dust allergy.   

03:43.800 --> 03:45.200
    (laughing harder)           

03:45.400 --> 03:46.600
          I'm serious.          

03:46.700 --> 03:48.600
      I could have fallen       
      and broken my neck.       

03:48.600 --> 03:50.100
        Stop, Dr. Crane.        

03:50.200 --> 03:51.800
    Let me catch my breath.     

03:53.700 --> 03:55.800
Hey, there's the guy            
who took the header             

03:55.900 --> 03:57.700
into our ditch.                 

03:57.700 --> 03:59.400
                  Hey, why'd you
                do that, man?   

03:59.400 --> 04:00.600
  You almost broke your neck.   

04:00.700 --> 04:02.000
  Hey, don't get him started.   

04:02.000 --> 04:03.400
  He's got this whole routine.  

04:05.200 --> 04:06.300
      Can I help you guys?      

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
Yeah, you can help us out       
with a couple of beers.         

04:08.500 --> 04:09.700
    That'll be five dollars.    

04:09.800 --> 04:11.600
         Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.200
We can't have our boys in the   
    trenches paying for this.   

04:14.200 --> 04:16.500
         No-no, much better they
    spend their valuable time   

04:16.600 --> 04:18.700
                 finishing their
                work upstairs   

04:18.700 --> 04:21.500
    than digging around in their
wallets for the exact change.   

04:21.600 --> 04:24.800
            Now, here's a man   
             who understands the
          construction business.

04:24.900 --> 04:25.900
What are you doing?             

04:26.000 --> 04:27.300
                What am I doing?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.000
                I'm greasing the
        construction workers.   

04:29.000 --> 04:32.900
        Ooh, that'd make a great
     title for my autobiography.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.300
This is disgusting.             

04:36.400 --> 04:37.600
                What?           

04:37.600 --> 04:39.100
Bribing those men               
to do their job?                

04:39.100 --> 04:41.800
What happened to an honest day's
work for an honest day's pay?   

04:41.900 --> 04:42.700
    (Frasier laughing)          

04:42.900 --> 04:46.000
             Now, that is funny.
                      (laughing)

04:46.000 --> 04:48.600
Nothing will top the one        
about you breaking your neck.   

04:48.700 --> 04:52.100
    It's all in the delivery.   

04:52.200 --> 04:54.600
    Excuse me, uh, that was     
  a very nice gesture of Sam,   

04:54.700 --> 04:56.300
    but I'm the manager here,   

04:56.400 --> 04:58.100
            and I am responsible
        for receiving payment   

04:58.200 --> 04:59.600
     for services rendered.     

04:59.600 --> 05:01.100
          Honey, honey, don't...

05:01.100 --> 05:03.000
          No, no, no, the lady's
            got the right idea--

05:03.100 --> 05:04.800
        pride in workmanship.   

05:04.800 --> 05:08.100
         You have inspired us to
        go out and do our job   
              as well as we can,

05:08.100 --> 05:09.800
no matter how                   
long it takes.                  

05:09.900 --> 05:12.300
After all, we're craftsmen.     

05:14.600 --> 05:16.200
            You see?            

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
    Well, that was Ma.          

05:20.900 --> 05:22.300
    Her flight got in           
      a little bit early,       

05:22.400 --> 05:24.600
 and, uh, she'll be by as soon  
      as she grabs a cab.       

05:24.700 --> 05:26.000
             Your mom's in town?
             Yeah.              

05:26.100 --> 05:27.600
                Why don't you go
                    pick her up?

05:27.700 --> 05:29.700
Oh, Normie, that would set      
     exactly the wrong tone     

05:29.800 --> 05:30.900
        for this visit.         

05:30.900 --> 05:32.200
    You know why she's here.    

05:32.200 --> 05:34.000
She wants to move back in       
            with me.            

05:34.100 --> 05:37.000
Well, she can just              
forget it, I tell you.          

05:37.100 --> 05:39.200
She's not gonna be running      
my life like she did            

05:39.300 --> 05:42.400
when I was in my mid-30s,       
no, sirree, sir.                

05:42.400 --> 05:45.400
No-no. I'm a new                
Cliff Clavin, new man.          

05:45.400 --> 05:47.200
Oh, hey, yeah,                  
I'd be happy to see her.        

05:47.300 --> 05:49.200
I'd take her out to dinner,     
give her a perm,                

05:49.300 --> 05:52.000
but that's about it.            

05:52.100 --> 05:53.600
  I don't get it, Mr. Clavin.   

05:53.600 --> 05:55.400
I thought you liked your mom... 
             a lot.             

05:55.500 --> 05:56.300
                    A whole lot.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.300
Too much to be healthy, really. 

05:59.400 --> 06:02.200
        Why don't I hear        
    any jackhammering?          

06:02.200 --> 06:03.600
I don't know.                   

06:03.700 --> 06:05.700
Why don't you, uh, go on        
up there and find out           

06:05.700 --> 06:07.800
what they're doing              
and come back and let us know?  

06:07.900 --> 06:09.000
         Right, Carla.          

06:09.100 --> 06:11.400
 And then I would probably fall 
    in a hole or something.     

06:11.500 --> 06:12.900
    What do you think           
        I am, an idiot?         

06:12.900 --> 06:17.100
             We prefer the term,
                 hapless victim.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.500
  I'll tell you why you don't   
    hear any jackhammering.     

06:19.500 --> 06:21.600
        They're pulling         
      a slowdown up there.      

06:21.600 --> 06:24.700
WORKER:                         
Good heavens. I laced           
my boot incorrectly.            

06:24.800 --> 06:27.200
I'll have to start              
all over again.                 

06:27.300 --> 06:29.800
        Oh, man, this is        
        making me crazy.        

06:29.900 --> 06:31.200
     They're gonna be here      
          for a month.          

06:31.200 --> 06:32.900
Look, I'm sorry, Rebecca.       

06:33.000 --> 06:36.300
                 You gotta go up
            and give that guy   
            this $50 he dropped.

06:36.300 --> 06:40.100
As a matter of fact,            
I think they both               
dropped $50. There.             

06:40.200 --> 06:41.600
                No, Sam, I'm not
                  gonna do this.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.900
                You cannot bribe
                      those men.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
                It's a matter   
                of principle.   

06:45.100 --> 06:46.300
    Rebecca, it's like          

06:46.300 --> 06:48.300
    the cardinal rule           
 of the free enterprise system. 

06:48.300 --> 06:50.400
  You pay somebody more money,  
    they work faster.           

06:50.500 --> 06:51.600
    Hey, look at this.          

06:51.700 --> 06:53.300
     We're getting a raise      
      at the post office.       

06:53.400 --> 06:55.700
              The exception that
                proves the rule.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.600
No, you see...                  

06:57.600 --> 06:59.300
        Sam, no, no, you made   
                 me the manager.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.400
    You gave me the authority   
    to handle these problems.   

07:01.500 --> 07:03.600
            So let me just do   
                  it my own way.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.800
Okay, Manager,                  
what are you gonna do?          

07:06.900 --> 07:09.700
Well, I think we'll just make   
  an entrance through the alley.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.900
 Oh, you've got to be kidding.  

07:11.000 --> 07:12.800
     What are you gonna do,     
    bust a hole in my wall?     

07:12.800 --> 07:14.400
                        NORM:   
            Well, actually, Sam,

07:14.500 --> 07:16.800
     you know that window,      
the leaded stained glass window 

07:16.800 --> 07:19.000
  is in a single wooden frame,  
so I think you could pop it out 

07:19.100 --> 07:21.500
 fairly easily with a crowbar.  

07:21.500 --> 07:22.900
     I think the opening's      
      like four by eight,       

07:23.000 --> 07:25.200
    which is perfectly good     
    for a standard entrance.    

07:25.300 --> 07:26.500
  You build a little staircase  

07:26.600 --> 07:28.300
    and you've got yourself     
     a nice little doorway.     

07:28.300 --> 07:31.500
     Well, you've put a lot     
     of thought into this.      

07:31.600 --> 07:33.200
It's always been a dream of mine

07:33.300 --> 07:36.800
  to someday retire and build   
 a little apartment back there. 

07:43.100 --> 07:44.500
        Hello, Clifford.        

07:44.600 --> 07:46.200
      Hey, Ma! Hey, look.       

07:47.900 --> 07:50.600
             Come on here.      
                 Ah...          

07:50.700 --> 07:52.200
            (chuckling)         

07:52.300 --> 07:56.000
My, everybody has               
filled out nicely.              

07:57.700 --> 08:01.000
         Well, say, Mrs. Clavin,
    if you don't mind my asking,

08:01.100 --> 08:03.400
    uh, how did you, happen     
     to negotiate that hole     

08:03.500 --> 08:05.300
  up at the top of the stairs?  

08:05.400 --> 08:08.000
Oh, I just hiked up my skirt    
and hopped across.              

08:08.000 --> 08:09.100
No big deal.                    

08:09.200 --> 08:11.300
Although those                  
construction boys told me       

08:11.400 --> 08:12.700
some jackass                    
actually fell in.               

08:12.800 --> 08:14.100
Can you believe that?           

08:14.200 --> 08:15.500
            (laughs)            

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
I'm a boob. I'm a big, fat boob.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.700
             CLIFF:             
          So, uh, Ma,           

08:22.800 --> 08:26.500
what made you decide to blow    
into town all of a sudden?      

08:26.600 --> 08:29.300
                Well you know   
                how much I enjoy

08:29.400 --> 08:32.500
        the historically rich   
            sport of dog racing.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.100
Who doesn't?                    

08:34.200 --> 08:37.900
      It turned out I enjoyed it
     a bit too much last Friday,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
    and, uh, let's just say I   
     owe some people some money.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.200
                    Whoops.     

08:43.299 --> 08:47.700
      Well, the dog I put all my
        money on, apparently had
          a parasitic condition.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.100
                  He scooted the
                  last 75 yards.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.900
    He got the most laughs,     

08:52.000 --> 08:54.800
              but they don't pay
                      on laughs.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.200
             Anyway, it gives me

08:56.200 --> 08:59.600
            a chance to catch up
             with my little boy.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.700
          I'm looking forward to
        seeing what you're doing

09:01.700 --> 09:04.900
    with your life and how we   
         can go about fixing it.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.400
I, uh, appreciate               
the thought, Ma,                

09:07.500 --> 09:09.400
but, I don't have anything      
that needs fixing.              

09:09.400 --> 09:11.400
See, I, uh, I've got            
a new lifestyle.                

09:11.500 --> 09:12.700
I, uh, I like it.               

09:12.800 --> 09:15.200
          Clifford, is it really
                a new lifestyle,

09:15.300 --> 09:16.700
         or is it just an excuse

09:16.800 --> 09:19.500
             to walk around your
        apartment half naked?   

09:19.500 --> 09:24.100
It's, uh, not an                
either-or situation, Ma.        

09:27.400 --> 09:31.200
    I suppose there's no room in
    this playboy pad of yours   

09:31.300 --> 09:33.000
          for somebody's mother?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.700
Thank you for, uh, being        
so understanding, Ma.           

09:35.800 --> 09:37.300
                      Oh.       

09:37.400 --> 09:40.800
 Well, I certainly don't want to
be a burden to you, Clifford.   

09:40.900 --> 09:42.500
                  Lord knows you
          weren't a burden to me

09:42.600 --> 09:45.600
             when I was in labor
          with you for 72 hours.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.900
                 Whoa. 72 hours?

09:47.900 --> 09:50.000
         He had those wide hips.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.600
I got you                       
a great hotel here.             

09:54.700 --> 09:57.800
Look, it's got HBO...           
                You shouldn't go
                to that expense.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.200
        All I need is a large   
            appliance carton,   

10:00.200 --> 10:02.800
              and I can sleep on
                the street...   

10:02.800 --> 10:04.700
              with all the other
              forgotten mothers.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.900
     You can stay with me.      

10:08.000 --> 10:11.300
Are you sure you don't have a   
  lifestyle I'd be intruding on?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.900
      Not that I know of.       

10:13.900 --> 10:16.900
                  Well, then I'd
                     be glad to.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.200
            What's your name?   

10:18.200 --> 10:21.400
             Woody.             
                          Woody.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.300
    Oh, that's the name of a boy
  whose mother raised him right.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.100
            Really?             

10:26.200 --> 10:29.900
 'Cause I looked it up and all  
  I could find was "treelike."  

10:33.700 --> 10:35.300
  Well, let's get you settled   
      in, huh, Mrs. Cla...      

10:35.400 --> 10:36.500
No, no, hey, hey, Woody,        

10:36.500 --> 10:38.300
my mother doesn't want          
to impose on anybody.           

10:38.400 --> 10:41.700
Oh, suddenly he's an            
expert on my desires.           

10:41.800 --> 10:43.500
I certainly do want             
to stay with Woody.             

10:43.600 --> 10:45.000
    I like him.                 

10:45.000 --> 10:49.700
He's sweet and thoughtful, and  
look at those nice, narrow hips.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.600
I'll bet you shot out           
like a bullet.                  

11:00.500 --> 11:02.300
          Well, Norm's          
      got the window out.       

11:02.300 --> 11:04.800
      Now he's starting on      
         the iron bars.         

11:04.900 --> 11:06.600
             When he's finished,
            anybody who wants to

11:06.700 --> 11:08.200
          can come into this bar

11:08.200 --> 11:09.700
    right through that alley.   

11:09.800 --> 11:11.600
        (barking)               

11:16.400 --> 11:18.200
    What was that?              

11:18.300 --> 11:21.000
      Two big dogs chasing      
          a Chihuahua.          

11:21.100 --> 11:23.100
        At least I think        
      it was a Chihuahua.       

11:23.200 --> 11:25.800
If the health department        
asks, it was a Chihuahua.       

11:28.800 --> 11:30.600
            Thanks for giving me
              a lift, Ma Clavin.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.400
My pleasure, Woody.             

11:32.400 --> 11:33.500
Here's your lunch.              

11:33.600 --> 11:35.100
I cut the grapes in half,       

11:35.100 --> 11:37.500
but should one lodge            
in your esophagus,              

11:37.600 --> 11:41.000
remember the international      
sign for choking is this.       

11:45.100 --> 11:48.400
     Uh, how come you never     
      taught me that, Ma?       

11:48.500 --> 11:49.700
Oh, Clifford.                   

11:49.700 --> 11:51.200
With that windpipe of yours,    

11:51.200 --> 11:54.200
it would take a knockwurst      
to cut off your air.            

11:55.800 --> 11:56.300
     I'll be home at 7:00.      

11:56.500 --> 11:58.000
Don't be late.                  

11:58.100 --> 11:59.900
I'm stopping at                 
the video store                 

12:00.000 --> 12:02.600
to pick up the rest of          
the <i>Police Academy</i> cycle.       

12:02.700 --> 12:04.200
                        Ah...   
    Oh,                         

12:04.300 --> 12:07.800
I love that handsome,           
young African American          

12:07.900 --> 12:10.100
who makes those                 
funny noises with his mouth.    

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
             Yeah, he's a hoot, 
                 isn't he?      

12:12.300 --> 12:13.600
Yes, he is.                     

12:13.700 --> 12:15.200
And you can tell                
by watching him                 

12:15.300 --> 12:18.900
he's very respectful            
to his mother.                  

12:19.000 --> 12:22.700
          Ma, are you mad at me?

12:22.800 --> 12:25.600
I'd have to care to be mad.     

12:25.700 --> 12:27.100
          Look, Ma, I didn't say

12:27.200 --> 12:30.500
    I never wanted to see you   
     again, for crying out loud.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.400
            Listen, why don't   
                you come over   

12:32.400 --> 12:34.400
                and we watch uh,
          <i>Jeopardy</i> tonight, huh?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
            Just come on over   
            to the apartment.   

12:36.500 --> 12:40.100
Oh, praise God, I've            
been invited to Xanadu.         

12:41.600 --> 12:46.200
Actually, Clifford, I happen    
to have a previous engagement.  

12:48.600 --> 12:55.100
          (inaudible whispering)
No... no... no... no.           

12:55.200 --> 12:57.600
Oh, all right.                  

12:57.700 --> 12:59.400
Clifford, we'd be delighted     

12:59.500 --> 13:03.200
 to have you join us for        
 <i>Police Academy</i> tonight.        

13:03.300 --> 13:04.600
        Oh, no, that's okay, Ma.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.600
        I'm just gonna have a   
          lot of fun right here.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.400
         I'm as happy as a lark.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.600
                 Well, actually,
                     Mr. Clavin,

13:09.700 --> 13:11.700
              the lark is a very
                 depressed bird.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.000
                It has one of   
                     the highest

13:13.000 --> 13:17.200
     suicide rates in the entire
         ornithological kingdom.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.800
        Interestingly enough,   
                     its song...

13:18.900 --> 13:20.300
          ...is more of a dirge.
             Is more of a dirge.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.800
        You've been teaching him
bird trivia, haven't you, Ma?   

13:25.500 --> 13:30.000
Woody is the best student       
I've had, bar none.             

13:30.000 --> 13:32.800
          Huh. I know what      
      you're trying to do, Ma,  
    and it's not going to work. 

13:32.900 --> 13:34.600
                You're trying to
                make me jealous.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.400
        Huh. Well, I'm not going
        to be asking you to move
                back in with me.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.500
                Don't you worry.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.200
          I know your wily ways.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.200
     You see, you're forgetting,
         I am a graduate student

13:42.300 --> 13:47.300
     of the Esther Clavin School
         of Emotional Blackmail.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.100
Well, that, and a nickel will   
get you a civil service job.    

13:51.400 --> 13:54.700
                Back off, Ma.   

13:54.800 --> 13:57.900
Clifford, I'm not trying        
to get you jealous.             

13:58.000 --> 13:59.200
I don't have to.                

13:59.300 --> 14:00.300
I found a wonderful             

14:00.300 --> 14:02.600
companion in Woody.             

14:02.600 --> 14:05.200
He's like the son               
I never had.                    

14:06.800 --> 14:08.400
            Well, what about me?

14:08.500 --> 14:11.300
You are the son I did have.     

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah, I'm telling you, Norm,    
I really let Ma have it.        

14:24.000 --> 14:25.700
          I cut clean.          

14:25.700 --> 14:27.900
    Well, I'll have to take     
    your word for it, Cliff.    

14:27.900 --> 14:31.700
Yeah, it really feels good      
to get that monkey off my back. 

14:31.800 --> 14:33.500
    Whatever you say.           

14:33.500 --> 14:37.200
Yeah, she's out of there,       
    gone, good-bye, finito.     

14:37.200 --> 14:40.000
  Cliff, what do I have to say  
to make you stop talking?       

14:40.000 --> 14:42.700
        Yes, sir, today         
    I am a man, Norm.           

14:42.800 --> 14:44.400
How about, "I've got a crowbar?"

14:44.400 --> 14:45.600
        (chuckles)              

14:45.700 --> 14:47.800
            Oh, hey, Rebecca,   
                        come on,

14:47.800 --> 14:50.300
             you be Ma again and
          I'll be me, all right?

14:50.300 --> 14:53.100
Oh, Cliff, you know, Sam does   
a lot better Ma than I do.      

14:53.100 --> 14:54.600
         Oh, yeah, right, right.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.900
All right, Ma, get off my back! 

14:58.000 --> 14:59.700
SAM:                            
I'm busy, Cliff.                

14:59.800 --> 15:01.100
        Oh, no, no, Sam.        

15:01.200 --> 15:03.000
     There's too much love      
         in your voice.         

15:03.000 --> 15:05.700
                    I think that
                 ought to do it.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.900
What do you mean                
"that ought to do it?"          

15:08.000 --> 15:09.500
  You need to cut another bar   
         out of there.          

15:09.600 --> 15:11.200
     People have to squeeze     
         through there.         

15:11.300 --> 15:12.300
              Rebecca, trust me.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.200
        I've spent a lifetime   
              learning how to do

15:14.300 --> 15:16.400
        the least amount of work
             for any given task.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.500
        This'll fit the bill.   

15:17.600 --> 15:19.000
      I-I just don't think      

15:19.100 --> 15:21.300
 anybody's really gonna be able 
     to fit through there.      

15:21.400 --> 15:22.400
                Even I could fit
                  through there.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.400
        Watch this. Look.       

15:23.400 --> 15:25.500
                 You just... you
                 just sort of...

15:25.500 --> 15:28.000
                (grunting):     
            ...up and through...

15:29.600 --> 15:31.200
                Well, that's it.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.100
        That's it what?         

15:32.300 --> 15:33.500
  You're not halfway through.   

15:33.600 --> 15:36.000
    No, that's it, I'm stuck.   

15:37.400 --> 15:40.800
            I'll be in Cheers   
            the rest of my life.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.000
    Guess you have to be careful
              what you wish for.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.200
      Let me see if I can       
        get you unstuck.        

15:45.300 --> 15:47.500
        (grunting)              

15:47.500 --> 15:48.700
        Oh, gosh.               

15:48.800 --> 15:50.100
That's it, you are stuck.       

15:50.200 --> 15:53.100
          Sam! Carla!           

15:53.100 --> 15:54.700
  You'd better hurry, Rebecca,  

15:54.700 --> 15:58.100
      'cause I think I see      
  that damned Chihuahua again.  

15:58.200 --> 16:01.800
      Hey, there's a whole      
      pack of Chihuahuas.       

16:01.900 --> 16:04.100
I hope they're Chihuahuas!      

16:04.100 --> 16:06.000
          Oh, my God!           

16:15.000 --> 16:15.900
You okay out there?             

16:15.900 --> 16:17.200
                Yeah.           

16:17.300 --> 16:19.800
    I think they're as afraid   
          of me as I am of them.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.600
          Yeah, except          
     you don't carry rabies     

16:21.700 --> 16:23.200
  and have razor-sharp teeth.   

16:23.300 --> 16:25.700
Yeah, but they don't know that. 

16:25.800 --> 16:29.100
      Boy, you really are       
        wedged in there.        

16:29.200 --> 16:31.100
        Is that Norm?           

16:31.100 --> 16:33.100
        Geez, you know,         
     I didn't recognize you     

16:33.100 --> 16:34.700
without the bar stool attached. 

16:34.800 --> 16:36.300
        (laughing)              

16:40.300 --> 16:42.100
Hey, you know                   
who he looks like?              

16:42.200 --> 16:43.100
Winnie the Pooh.                

16:43.200 --> 16:44.400
              Oh, Carla's right.
    Yeah.                       

16:44.500 --> 16:45.700
    Yeah, in that story where   

16:45.700 --> 16:48.200
      he eats too much honey and
    gets stuck in Rabbit's hole.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.500
             Yeah, well, how did
            they get him out?   

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
      Oh, it's hilarious.       

16:51.700 --> 16:53.200
They starved him                
for a couple of weeks,          

16:53.300 --> 16:54.300
then yanked him out.            

16:54.300 --> 16:55.600
                 Yeah. Now, when
                     he got out,

16:55.600 --> 16:58.400
      did Winnie the Pooh       
  sue the damned Rabbit, huh?   

16:58.500 --> 17:01.600
         Come on, man,          
     lighten up, will you?      

17:01.600 --> 17:02.800
              Oh, sorry, Sammie.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.500
        I'm just upset, okay?   

17:04.599 --> 17:06.800
No, I mean, you're like         
dead weight here.               

17:06.800 --> 17:08.099
Push, pull, do something.       

17:11.000 --> 17:13.400
         Yeah, so I told her,   
                "Pack your bags.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.700
        Go on, hit the skids.   
      I don't need you anymore."

17:15.700 --> 17:18.200
What's the matter               
with him? Girl trouble?         

17:18.200 --> 17:19.400
                  Well, sort of.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.700
              Now I'll just have
                to raise myself.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.700
        Well, the hard work's   
            already done though.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.500
              Where is the child
      that's stuck in the fence?

17:31.600 --> 17:32.800
Oh, good, you're here.          

17:32.900 --> 17:34.400
Uh, back this way,              
in the poolroom.                

17:34.400 --> 17:36.200
"Child stuck in the fence?"     

17:36.300 --> 17:37.700
        Well, every time I said,

17:37.800 --> 17:40.200
 "Accountant stuck in a window,"
  they just laughed and hung up.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.700
                        REBECCA:
                 It's back here.

17:42.700 --> 17:46.000
Oh, Woody, that was fun.        

17:46.100 --> 17:48.700
It's so nice to go              
shopping for shelf paper        

17:48.700 --> 17:52.600
with somebody who doesn't       
nitpick over every design.      

17:52.700 --> 17:55.600
     Ma, when are you gonna stop
    taking those potshots at me?

17:55.600 --> 17:58.600
When it stops being fun.        

17:58.600 --> 18:00.300
             Excuse me, Woody.  

18:00.400 --> 18:02.600
                    I'm gonna go
                 powder my nose.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.400
Your nose looks fine,           
Mother Clavin.                  

18:04.500 --> 18:07.100
That's just an expression, son. 

18:07.200 --> 18:07.900
    Ah.                         

18:09.500 --> 18:11.300
                        Son?    

18:11.400 --> 18:14.000
              She's, uh, calling
                  you "son" now?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.100
Well, that's just               
an expression.                  

18:16.200 --> 18:17.800
You know, like                  
"powder my nose."               

18:17.800 --> 18:19.300
            I understand, Woody.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.400
    I want to thank you, really,
  for all you've done for my ma,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.600
    you know, giving her a place
         to live and everything.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.000
        There's one thing       
        my sense of pride       

18:27.100 --> 18:28.500
won't allow me to say to her,   

18:28.500 --> 18:31.200
        but I know I can talk to
        you about it man-to-man.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.300
            (crying):           
         I want my mommy back.  

18:35.300 --> 18:37.600
You can't have her back.        
You gave her up.                

18:37.700 --> 18:40.000
            Wood, I miss her!   

18:40.100 --> 18:42.100
Well, if I give her to you,     
then I'll miss her, too.        

18:42.200 --> 18:43.300
    Can't we share?             

18:43.300 --> 18:45.400
          I don't want to share!

18:45.400 --> 18:47.800
      Oh, for God's sake!       

18:47.800 --> 18:50.000
  You're acting like children.  

18:50.100 --> 18:51.500
      Now, listen, Woody,       

18:51.600 --> 18:55.600
        Esther Clavin is        
    Cliff's natural mother.     

18:55.700 --> 18:57.900
     Therefore, logic would     
    dictate that, uh,           

18:58.000 --> 18:59.700
  well, Cliff gets first dibs.  

19:03.700 --> 19:06.000
Well, Woody, are we ready       
      to line some shelves      

19:06.100 --> 19:07.900
    with flags of the world?    

19:07.900 --> 19:11.600
    Woody?                      

19:11.700 --> 19:15.300
Woody, if you stick             
that lower lip out any further, 

19:15.400 --> 19:17.100
a pigeon's gonna land on it.    

19:18.500 --> 19:19.900
You know that they like         

19:19.900 --> 19:23.600
shiny, ledge-like surfaces.     

19:23.600 --> 19:25.800
                    (crying):   
      Don't bring up bird trivia
             now, Mother Clavin.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.600
              It hurts too much.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.100
Why, Woody, whatever            
are you talking about?          

19:30.200 --> 19:34.300
         (crying and mumbling)  

19:34.300 --> 19:37.700
All right,                      
all right, all right.           

19:37.700 --> 19:39.900
Is this true, Clifford?         

19:40.000 --> 19:41.400
        Yeah, Ma, it is.        

19:41.400 --> 19:43.700
                I want you back.

19:43.700 --> 19:48.900
Well, is there room for me in   
that singles' paradise of yours?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.200
        I'll, I'll make room.   

19:51.200 --> 19:54.000
Well, I made room               
for you, Mother Clavin.         

19:54.000 --> 19:55.400
                I'll make room  
                in your face!   

19:55.500 --> 19:58.100
        No, no, no, no.         
        Now, now, boys,         

19:58.100 --> 20:02.800
let's not get into a Cain       
    and Abel situation here.    

20:03.000 --> 20:05.900
      I can love you both       
     for different reasons.     

20:05.900 --> 20:07.400
     Woody, I can love you      

20:07.400 --> 20:10.900
    because you're generous     
      and kind and strong.      

20:11.000 --> 20:13.200
  And Clifford, I can love you  

20:13.200 --> 20:15.500
        because I'm your        
    biological mother,          

20:15.500 --> 20:18.200
      and nature dictates       
        there be a bond.        

20:19.900 --> 20:21.600
Now, boys,                      

20:21.700 --> 20:23.900
        I've got plenty         
    of love for both,           

20:24.000 --> 20:27.700
    and Lord knows I've got     
     plenty of shelf paper.     

20:27.700 --> 20:30.000
      I'll tell you what,       
      let's get cracking.       

20:30.000 --> 20:32.300
We can do both of your          
apartments before dark.         

20:32.300 --> 20:33.400
     Got to do mine first.      

20:33.500 --> 20:35.000
            Not if I get to     
             the car first.     

20:35.000 --> 20:36.600
Yeah, well, you're not going    
to do that until you beat me.   

20:36.700 --> 20:38.900
                    I can.      
No, you can't!                  

20:39.000 --> 20:40.600
 Boys, watch out for the hole!  

20:40.700 --> 20:42.600
(Woody and Cliff yelling)       
          (loud crash)          

20:43.900 --> 20:45.900
        Yes, they are my        
      children all right.       

20:45.900 --> 20:47.500
    Both dumb as dishwater.     

20:49.700 --> 20:51.100
Well, we can get him out,       

20:51.100 --> 20:53.300
but we're gonna have to         
bring in the Jaws of Life.      

20:53.300 --> 20:55.000
    He's really stuck           
        in there.               

20:55.100 --> 20:57.700
Yeah, it remind me of that      
Winnie the Pooh story.          

20:59.600 --> 21:01.400
         Say, how'd he get stuck
            in there, anyway?   

21:01.500 --> 21:03.900
Well, he ate up                 
all of Rabbit's honey...        

21:04.000 --> 21:07.500
    No, I mean this guy.        

21:07.600 --> 21:11.300
Uh, we were, uh, building       
        a new entrance.         

21:11.300 --> 21:13.000
Do you have a permit            
for that?                       

21:13.100 --> 21:15.700
          Oh. He wants a permit.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.500
                 This time we'll
             handle it your way.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.300
            No.                 
     Yes. Yes, I'll do it.      

21:19.300 --> 21:24.600
     Let me just reach into     
    my magic-permit pocket.     

21:24.600 --> 21:28.000
                    No, no.     
    Yes, yes.                   

21:28.000 --> 21:32.400
          And, oh, here's       
        a nice little permit    

21:32.400 --> 21:35.500
        with a picture          
      of General Grant on it.   

21:35.600 --> 21:38.200
What are you doing?             
            (chuckles)          

21:38.300 --> 21:42.400
What, like you have             
never been bribed before?       

21:42.600 --> 21:46.800
Are you trying to give          
us this 50 bucks?               

21:46.900 --> 21:49.200
What, 50 isn't enough?          

21:49.200 --> 21:50.700
    How about 100?              

21:50.800 --> 21:53.000
All right, you're               
under arrest. Come on.          

21:53.100 --> 21:56.000
    Sam, would you get          
         my checkbook?          

21:57.300 --> 21:59.600
      So you guys ought to      
      have me out of here       

21:59.600 --> 22:01.700
  in just a few minutes, huh?   

22:01.700 --> 22:03.800
          Right, guys?          

22:03.900 --> 22:07.000
             Guys!
