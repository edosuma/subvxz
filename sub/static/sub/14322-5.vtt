00:01.416 --> 00:03.208
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.208 --> 00:05.000
Don't touch that dial!

00:05.000 --> 00:09.708
And what, pray tell, are you
X-Men going to give this

00:09.708 --> 00:12.500
mind-numbed bunch
of couch potatoes

00:12.500 --> 00:14.166
and the trillions
watching at home?

00:14.166 --> 00:18.875
They want blood and guts
and love and hate.

00:18.875 --> 00:21.875
They want entertainment!

00:21.875 --> 00:24.958
Violence and destruction
are not forms of amusement.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.416
Trust me, they are.

00:28.416 --> 00:32.708
This, if you haven't been
paying attention,
is my dimension!

00:32.708 --> 00:37.583
Get with the program
or get crushed!

00:43.000 --> 00:45.625
[opening theme song]

01:13.083 --> 01:15.083
Red light. Red light!

01:15.458 --> 01:18.708
-I saw it!
-Yeah, right.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.583
Why don't you
pull in over there.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.083
I'll just be a minute.

01:28.083 --> 01:31.625
Don't take all day!
I'm just starting to get good.

01:33.166 --> 01:36.000
I always forget
that clutch part.

01:38.458 --> 01:40.583
Hey, watch out!

01:40.583 --> 01:44.083
Hello, sweetheart.
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

01:44.583 --> 01:45.708
Wow!

01:46.750 --> 01:51.208
Uh-oh. Wolverine!
Who ordered the fireworks?

01:54.416 --> 01:56.000
Where are we?

02:02.500 --> 02:05.375
Why does this stuff
always happen to me?

02:09.208 --> 02:12.416
-There! Take him!
-They mean you!

02:22.708 --> 02:26.875
Nice try.
But your luck just ran out.

02:27.458 --> 02:31.208
Spiral! The Master Programmer
wants him brought back

02:31.208 --> 02:35.708
-alive.
-He didn't specify
in what condition.

02:35.708 --> 02:36.958
Stop!

02:39.458 --> 02:43.500
Jubilee, Princess
of Pyrotechnics, commands you

02:43.500 --> 02:46.958
-to release the human!
-Ignore her.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.125
-She's just a little girl.
-A little girl?

02:55.250 --> 02:57.333
We should probably go.

02:57.333 --> 03:02.208
If that rebel scum gets away,
I'll cancel you, permanently!

03:06.458 --> 03:09.875
Warwolves! After the Lucky One!

03:12.500 --> 03:16.708
Uh-oh. Jubilee!

03:19.250 --> 03:20.583
Longshot.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.083
Come on!

03:45.375 --> 03:47.416
I think we're rid of them.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.166
Whoa! Not good.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.458
Back off, metalhead!

04:19.958 --> 04:21.500
[grunting]

04:22.875 --> 04:26.416
Bad doggie! No biscuit.

04:33.875 --> 04:36.708
We got leash laws
in this town, mutt.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.750
Hey, Rover! Heel!

04:44.166 --> 04:46.125
That's no way to treat a lady.

04:54.583 --> 04:57.375
Cancel them. Cancel them all.

05:06.166 --> 05:09.833
Let's just finish it here.
Just you and me, pal.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.458
These warriors
were not anticipated.

05:12.458 --> 05:16.125
-Time to pull the plug.
-Long broadcast Mojo!

05:18.750 --> 05:21.291
This isn't over, Longshot!

05:27.375 --> 05:29.000
Are you OK, Jubilee?

05:30.375 --> 05:33.291
Longshot! What are you
doing here, pretty boy?

05:33.291 --> 05:37.375
-Are you blind?
He's on our side!
-We don't know that.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.583
You've got about two seconds
to tell me
what's going on, blondie.

05:40.583 --> 05:44.750
I don't know.
I can't remember anything.

05:44.750 --> 05:48.958
Come on, Jubilee. I'm taking
your buddy here
to the professor.

05:48.958 --> 05:51.000
We could use some answers.

05:51.708 --> 05:55.708
What do you mean he got away?
Nitwits! Dim bulbs!

05:55.708 --> 06:00.250
He's still under contract!
Do you realize
what he's costing me?

06:03.500 --> 06:06.166
As if I don't have enough to
worry about.

06:06.166 --> 06:10.416
Slave rebellion, workers
who actually want to be paid,

06:10.416 --> 06:14.583
and my biggest star
turned rebel! Ingrate!

06:14.583 --> 06:19.250
After all I've done
for his career! Who decided
to let actors think?

06:19.250 --> 06:23.583
If you want the little jerk
so badly, why don't you
go get him yourself?

06:26.291 --> 06:29.875
You presumptuous stack
of armpits!

06:30.416 --> 06:34.708
Perhaps the sorceress
has a point,
my lardaceous liege.

06:38.333 --> 06:42.500
An expedition to a primitive
dimension like Earth's,

06:43.166 --> 06:47.458
home of the indomitable X-Men,
if I'm not mistaken,

06:47.458 --> 06:52.291
-led by the great Mojo himself.
-X-Men!

06:55.500 --> 06:59.708
Domo! Domo! I've just had
the most brilliant idea!

06:59.708 --> 07:04.291
I, Mojo, will lead
the expedition myself!

07:04.291 --> 07:08.083
Yeah! Think of it, think of it
now! Longshot, my biggest star,

07:08.083 --> 07:13.625
the X-Men, a proven ratings
hit, and me. It'll be huge!

07:14.750 --> 07:17.291
When you are on screen,
your bulbousity,

07:17.291 --> 07:20.500
the universe
positively quivers.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.625
We shall, however, need Spiral
to cleave time and space?

07:25.625 --> 07:28.083
Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.

07:34.583 --> 07:38.625
Gog, where's Gog? Gog!
Get your guys down to wardrobe!

07:38.625 --> 07:41.083
Come on, come on, come on,
we're burning daylight here!

07:41.083 --> 07:44.708
Scramble a remote crew.
We're going live!

07:46.583 --> 07:48.708
[Jubilee] And this
is the rec room.

07:48.708 --> 07:53.000
Sure, you don't want something
to drink? It's no problem.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.875
What the sam hill
is he doing here?

07:55.875 --> 07:58.125
Says he can't remember
anything.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.875
-I don't trust him.
-He saved your life!

08:00.875 --> 08:04.833
If you ask me, I think he's
part of some Mojo-run set up.

08:04.833 --> 08:08.625
-What is your problem?
-Who is our guest?

08:08.625 --> 08:11.208
-He's one of Mojo's cronies...
-We saved him from a bunch...

08:11.208 --> 08:14.291
-Beast?
-His name is Longshot.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.708
He was rescued earlier
this evening by Logan
and Jubilation

08:17.708 --> 08:20.000
from his
erstwhile employer, Mojo.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I didn't want him
wandering around loose,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.291
till you could take a look
inside his head.

08:24.291 --> 08:27.083
Are you blind?
He's on our side!

08:27.083 --> 08:29.000
We don't know that.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.083
Allowing me to scan his mind
must be Longshot's decision.

08:33.083 --> 08:35.958
I suggest he take
a moment to consider it.

08:38.833 --> 08:42.708
Come on, Longshot.
Time to blow this joint.

08:42.708 --> 08:43.875
Don't go far.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.333
I'll keep an eye on him.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.125
The gal's kind of sweet on him,
in case you didn't notice.

08:49.125 --> 08:50.500
I noticed.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.166
I hate it when Wolverine
treats me like a kid!

08:57.166 --> 09:01.083
I'm 15... 17 years old!

09:01.083 --> 09:02.875
I can look after myself!

09:02.875 --> 09:04.833
You certainly looked after me
back there.

09:04.833 --> 09:07.083
You have great courage.

09:07.083 --> 09:10.833
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.708
What's the name
of this dump again?

09:20.708 --> 09:23.416
Earth,
your magnificent abundance.

09:23.416 --> 09:27.458
Earth? As in dirt? That stinks.
Who's afraid of dirt?
No, no, no, no, no.

09:27.458 --> 09:31.208
We'll call it Danger World!
Yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, wait, wait.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.375
Terror World! Yeah!

09:34.250 --> 09:37.083
Untold rating points
will be mine!

09:37.083 --> 09:42.458
Action! Excitement!
Not too much violence though!

09:42.458 --> 09:45.166
Yeah, we'll leave that
for the news
and the talk shows.

09:59.875 --> 10:04.583
His mind is barren,
I think I can help.

10:04.583 --> 10:09.250
-But it will take time.
-I'm gonna go check on Jubilee.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.500
Huh?

10:18.375 --> 10:20.875
I don't remember
this being here.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.750
I remember a great battle.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.458
Mojo's genetically
engineered slaves rebelled.

10:35.875 --> 10:39.000
I, his star attraction,
was their leader.

10:40.583 --> 10:41.750
I was captured.

10:44.875 --> 10:49.208
Mojo erased my memories,
planning to use me
in his televised campaign

10:49.208 --> 10:51.166
to crush the rebels.

10:53.416 --> 10:57.625
My comrades rescued me.
Spiral tried to send them
all to oblivion.

11:01.708 --> 11:04.458
-And somehow I ended up here.
-Fascinating.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.875
Something's wrong.
Better get here pronto.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.458
What happened here?

11:13.458 --> 11:16.375
It appears that the local flora
has somehow been mutated,

11:16.375 --> 11:20.458
-drained of its life essence.
-It's Mojo! He's here!

11:21.416 --> 11:23.166
I can smell him.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.583
I fear that Mojo's continued
presence in our dimension

11:25.583 --> 11:28.708
could have dire consequences
for all life on Earth.

11:28.708 --> 11:31.083
I found something else!

11:31.083 --> 11:32.625
Jubilee's jacket!

11:35.583 --> 11:39.583
Nothing. I can't read
any future for her.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.958
-You don't mean she's...
-No, she's here somewhere!

11:42.958 --> 11:45.000
And we're gonna find her.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.583
So you see, it seems much has
changed on Mojo World

11:50.583 --> 11:53.208
since our television debut.

11:53.208 --> 11:59.166
Longshot's an actor. Who says
he ain't playing a part?

11:59.166 --> 12:02.208
-You'll have to trust me.
-My trust is earned, bub.

12:02.208 --> 12:05.958
And if anything happens
to Jubilee, it'll come
out of your hide.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.958
Beast was right.
This weird forest is growing.

12:08.958 --> 12:11.166
We gotta stop it before it gets
to peoples' homes!

12:11.166 --> 12:16.708
Live from Terror World,
it's the premiere
and final edition

12:16.708 --> 12:21.166
of "Intergalactic Gladiators!"

12:21.166 --> 12:26.958
I, Mojo, programmer
to the galaxy, present
our contestants tonight.

12:26.958 --> 12:31.000
Back by popular demand,
the X-Men!

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Beast, the mind of a genius
in the body
of a big blue gorilla.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.875
Rogue, whose luscious lips,
no man may kiss!

12:40.875 --> 12:43.500
Wolverine,
whose adamantium bones

12:43.500 --> 12:46.833
can't protect him
from a broken heart.

12:46.833 --> 12:50.166
Tonight's special guest star,
in his final appearance
anywhere,

12:50.166 --> 12:55.166
lover, rebel, movie star,
your heartthrob and mine,

12:55.166 --> 12:57.375
Longshot!

13:00.458 --> 13:02.458
Their opponents, the gladiators

13:02.458 --> 13:05.833
will hunt the X-Men through
the untamed wilds
of Terror World,

13:05.833 --> 13:08.416
-in the match-up
of the millennium.
-Fascinating.

13:08.416 --> 13:10.875
The first to reach
our lovely studio,

13:10.875 --> 13:14.333
filled with cash
and fabulous prizes
is the winner.

13:14.333 --> 13:18.333
And the bait, excuse me,
the grand prize, a dream date

13:18.333 --> 13:22.208
with teen heartthrob, Jubilee!

13:22.208 --> 13:25.000
Somebody
please get me out of here!

13:25.000 --> 13:29.125
What do we need
this little brat for?
She's nothing but trouble.

13:29.125 --> 13:32.375
Passion! Drama! Ratings!

13:32.375 --> 13:35.250
The other actors must be given
the proper motivation.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.583
Besides, I've got
just the spinoff for it!

13:44.583 --> 13:46.000
Run!

13:46.000 --> 13:47.875
Reckon I'll take
a little short cut.

13:48.625 --> 13:54.583
Oh, sorry, sugar. Air travel
is provided by Mojo
and only the Mojo!

13:56.708 --> 14:00.583
Make no mistake! These two
teams are here to play!

14:08.333 --> 14:10.250
I appreciate the lift.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.833
If you three can draw him off,
I can get to that arena
quicker alone.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.458
One of us should accompany you.

14:16.458 --> 14:19.250
I believe the phrase is,
"To watch your back."

14:19.250 --> 14:20.875
I'll go with Wolverine.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.875
-In a pig's eye, you...
-Listen to me.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.875
I know how Mojo works,
and I know the equipment.

14:25.875 --> 14:29.708
I got Jubilee into this.
I'm the only one
who can get her out.

14:31.375 --> 14:32.375
Move!

14:34.375 --> 14:36.708
This ought
to get their attention.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.125
This way.

14:44.708 --> 14:48.375
Hey, hey, hey, hunters!
I want to see
some serious carnage

14:48.375 --> 14:50.708
or you guys are going home
in a shoebox!

14:51.500 --> 14:54.125
Can I handle actors or what?

14:54.125 --> 14:55.875
We should stay
in the tree line.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.208
Now what?

15:02.458 --> 15:06.875
-A big purple lizard?
-Trust me,
the kids will love it!

15:16.125 --> 15:17.708
Hey, stomper!

15:25.416 --> 15:26.875
Dang!

15:26.875 --> 15:29.333
I sense possible sanctuary
in those cliffs.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.625
Hold it! We're being followed.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.416
You go on ahead.
I'll double back.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.833
[laughing] Wolverine.

15:48.375 --> 15:51.875
Quark, who do you want to be?
The guy who bumped off
an Earther,

15:51.875 --> 15:54.458
or the man
who defeated Longshot?

15:54.458 --> 15:56.083
Good point!

16:06.708 --> 16:08.583
He'll be out for a while.

16:08.583 --> 16:11.375
-Are you OK?
-I heal fast.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.708
Shoot them!
Somebody shoot them!

16:32.875 --> 16:34.458
Cancel them!

16:36.250 --> 16:42.375
No! No! This is horrible!
All this chaos!
All this destruction!

16:42.375 --> 16:45.333
And not a single camera
in sight!

16:46.000 --> 16:51.083
All cameras to the arena,
pronto! Yesterday! Move it!

16:52.250 --> 16:54.875
It appears we're no longer
the star attraction.

16:59.958 --> 17:01.500
Come on!

17:06.583 --> 17:09.375
Sorry, boys. Closed set.

17:09.375 --> 17:14.458
-Out of our way, Spiral.
-Don't you dare
tell me what to do!

17:14.458 --> 17:17.833
-What got her so worked up?
-We used to date.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.166
I'll handle her.
You get Jubilee.

17:28.625 --> 17:30.458
Looking for this?

17:31.625 --> 17:35.875
Gog, cancel
this little mophead!

17:35.875 --> 17:38.583
This will look great
on my resume!

17:39.333 --> 17:43.875
So, Lucky One, it seems
your luck has finally run out.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.375
Bombs away!

17:54.333 --> 17:55.750
You all right, hon?

17:57.708 --> 17:59.708
Remember me, bright-eyes?

18:02.750 --> 18:04.208
My remote!

18:08.958 --> 18:12.750
-Jubilee! Are you all right?
-I am now.

18:13.583 --> 18:14.708
Thank you.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.416
My... my ratings!

18:18.416 --> 18:23.166
I'm risking embarrassment
and possible physical pain!

18:23.166 --> 18:25.833
And there are no ratings?
Spiral!

18:26.375 --> 18:31.458
-Spiral, dear,
get me out of here!
-Take a number!

18:35.708 --> 18:39.500
You! This is all your fault,
you little toad!

18:39.500 --> 18:41.333
Well, you haven't won yet!

18:41.333 --> 18:46.875
'Cause the show ain't over
till the fat man stings!

18:49.958 --> 18:52.875
-That's all, folks!
-No!

18:58.458 --> 19:01.583
Fooled you! Really had you
going there, didn't I?

19:01.583 --> 19:03.375
OK, joke's over.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.958
We can all go home now.
No hard feelings, eh, buddy?

19:11.458 --> 19:15.166
-Nice.
-Nah, just lucky.

19:15.875 --> 19:20.125
Gog! Spiral!
Get this freak off of me!

19:29.375 --> 19:34.083
I want a rematch, mutant.
Pay-per-view, of course.

19:34.083 --> 19:38.333
Fifty percent of all
intergalactic merchandise
and syndication revenue.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.708
Have I earned that trust yet?

19:40.708 --> 19:44.583
You're close. Go on. You just
got time for a quick goodbye.

19:44.583 --> 19:48.291
-Thanks. Jubilee, I...
-I know.

19:48.291 --> 19:53.125
You have to go. You have
a rebellion to lead
and people you care about.

19:53.125 --> 19:56.500
I'll never forget you, Jubilee.
Thank you.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.708
Come on, kid. Let's head home.

20:15.583 --> 20:17.125
[closing theme song playing]

20:17.125 --> 20:18.875
It is the Spire!

20:19.500 --> 20:23.125
The Phalanx will use it
to summon
the rest of my people!

20:23.125 --> 20:26.083
To add this planet
to the Phalanx empire!

20:28.125 --> 20:32.208
It is Self's fault. Self never
should have come here.

20:32.583 --> 20:36.583
Now Selfriends Beast, Forge,

20:36.583 --> 20:40.208
your world is doomed!
