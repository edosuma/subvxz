00:00.899 --> 00:01.899
Hello, friend.

00:02.551 --> 00:03.841
Hello, friend?

00:04.100 --> 00:05.243
That's lame.

00:05.244 --> 00:07.439
Maybe I should give you a name,

00:07.440 --> 00:09.111
but that's a slippery slope.

00:09.112 --> 00:10.023
You're only in my head.

00:10.024 --> 00:11.947
We have to remember that.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.728
Shit.

00:13.799 --> 00:14.610
It's actually happened,

00:14.611 --> 00:16.722
I'm talking to an imaginary person.

00:18.399 --> 00:19.600
What I'm about to tell you

00:19.601 --> 00:20.939
is top secret,

00:21.099 --> 00:24.038
a conspiracy bigger than all of us.

00:24.599 --> 00:26.562
There's a powerful
group of people out there

00:26.563 --> 00:28.602
that are secretly running the world.

00:30.299 --> 00:32.234
I'm talking about the
guys no one knows about,

00:32.235 --> 00:34.082
the guys that are invisible.

00:35.199 --> 00:38.419
The top 1% of the top
1%, the guys that play God

00:38.420 --> 00:40.236
without permission.

00:42.499 --> 00:44.447
And now I think they're following me.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.699 --> 00:55.491
This is about last night.

00:55.492 --> 00:58.048
I should've gone to
Angela's birthday party.

00:58.499 --> 01:00.699
Instead, I went to...

01:13.299 --> 01:14.049
Hey, Ron.

01:14.050 --> 01:15.503
There you go.

01:51.699 --> 01:53.699
You're Ron.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.936
But your real name is Rohit Mehta.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.719
You changed it to Ron when you bought

02:02.720 --> 02:04.224
your first Ron's Coffee Shop

02:04.225 --> 02:05.906
six years ago.

02:05.999 --> 02:09.745
Now you got 17 of 'em with
8 more coming next quarter.

02:12.763 --> 02:14.566
May I help you with something?

02:14.700 --> 02:18.002
I like coming here 'cause
your Wi-Fi was fast.

02:18.003 --> 02:19.141
I mean, you're one of the few spots

02:19.142 --> 02:21.911
that has a fiber connection
with gigabit speed.

02:21.912 --> 02:23.213
It's good.

02:23.670 --> 02:27.177
So good, it scratched
that part of my mind, part

02:27.178 --> 02:30.938
that doesn't allow good
to exist without condition,

02:30.939 --> 02:33.602
so I started intercepting all the traffic

02:33.603 --> 02:34.872
on your network.

02:34.899 --> 02:37.160
That's when I noticed something strange.

02:38.212 --> 02:40.915
It's when I decided to hack you.

02:41.899 --> 02:43.683
- Hack...
- I know you run a website

02:43.684 --> 02:46.213
- called Plato's Boys.
- Pardon me?

02:46.214 --> 02:48.899
You're using Tor networking
to keep the servers anonymous.

02:48.900 --> 02:49.950
You made it really hard

02:49.951 --> 02:52.708
for anyone to see it, but I saw it.

02:53.181 --> 02:54.617
The onion routing protocol,

02:54.618 --> 02:56.899
it's not as anonymous as you think it is.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.899
Whoever's in control of the exit nodes

02:58.900 --> 03:00.899
is also in control of the traffic,

03:00.900 --> 03:02.677
which makes me...

03:03.344 --> 03:04.899
the one in control.

03:06.899 --> 03:08.899
I must ask you to kindly leave.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.834
I own everything. All your emails.

03:11.835 --> 03:13.398
All your files.

03:13.399 --> 03:14.899
All your... pics.

03:18.099 --> 03:20.240
Get out of here right now,

03:20.241 --> 03:22.054
- or I'll call the...
- Police?

03:22.055 --> 03:23.098
You want them to find out

03:23.099 --> 03:25.339
about the 100 terabytes
of child pornography

03:25.340 --> 03:27.691
you serve to your 400,000 users?

03:28.799 --> 03:31.017
Personally, man, I was

03:31.018 --> 03:32.700
hoping it was just gonna be

03:32.701 --> 03:34.524
some BDSM stuff.

03:35.013 --> 03:37.787
You realize how much
simpler that would have been?

03:42.199 --> 03:45.199
I did not hurt anyone.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.199
I never did.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.034
That's my...

03:54.035 --> 03:55.597
personal life.

03:59.699 --> 04:02.779
I understand what it's like

04:02.780 --> 04:04.829
to be different.

04:06.699 --> 04:09.607
I'm very different too.

04:11.299 --> 04:14.412
I mean, I don't jerk off
to little kids, but...

04:16.099 --> 04:18.149
I don't know how to talk to people.

04:18.798 --> 04:21.798
My dad was the only one I could talk to.

04:24.499 --> 04:26.499
But he died.

04:31.499 --> 04:33.360
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.138
- How did he pass, may I ask?
- Leukemia.

04:40.399 --> 04:43.985
He definitely got it from
radiation at the company

04:43.986 --> 04:46.233
he worked at, though I couldn't prove it.

04:47.399 --> 04:48.659
Now he's dead.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.000
Company's fine, though.

04:55.199 --> 04:57.870
Oh... hey.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.799
It's okay, Rohit.

05:02.799 --> 05:05.067
You don't have to worry anymore.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
I don't understand.

05:09.899 --> 05:11.900
Are you blackmailing me?

05:13.300 --> 05:15.678
So that's what this is about...

05:15.679 --> 05:17.600
money.

05:17.601 --> 05:20.737
That's all you care about, huh?

05:21.399 --> 05:23.399
No.

05:24.799 --> 05:26.266
If I pay you now,

05:26.267 --> 05:28.173
you'll want more and more.

05:28.174 --> 05:30.426
No matter how much I give.

05:32.268 --> 05:34.799
You will inform the police anyway.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.799
I won't pay you, sir.

05:38.799 --> 05:41.139
Remember, you also broke the law.

05:43.099 --> 05:45.099
Actually, you're right.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.909
Partly.

05:47.816 --> 05:50.682
See, I usually do this kind
of thing from my computer,

05:50.683 --> 05:52.878
but this time I wanted to do it AFK.

05:53.799 --> 05:55.799
In person.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.061
Trying to work on my social anxiety.

05:58.599 --> 06:00.434
But there's always the
threat of you fleeing

06:00.435 --> 06:01.810
after I call you out.

06:01.811 --> 06:05.045
You'd tell your sys admin
to take your servers down,

06:05.046 --> 06:06.346
wipe all the data.

06:06.347 --> 06:09.838
So I made sure to include the current time

06:09.839 --> 06:13.088
and... and location on my anonymous tip.

06:13.089 --> 06:14.795
Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money.

06:14.796 --> 06:15.848
I'll pay you.

06:15.849 --> 06:17.709
How much do you want? I'll pay you.

06:18.768 --> 06:21.255
That's the part you
were wrong about, Rohit.

06:21.779 --> 06:24.543
I don't give a shit about money.

06:36.834 --> 06:38.830
Now I'm being followed.

06:45.161 --> 06:47.168
The higher ups don't like
someone with my powers.

06:47.169 --> 06:49.862
In three short minutes, I
destroyed a man's business,

06:49.863 --> 06:51.337
life, existence.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.692
- I deleted him.
- Hey!

06:54.723 --> 06:57.367
Hey, you. Hey, kiddo.

06:58.606 --> 07:00.613
What's happening?

07:05.704 --> 07:08.083
Exciting time in the world right now.

07:09.040 --> 07:12.051
Exciting time.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.621
But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.626
By day, just a regular
cyber security engineer,

07:39.345 --> 07:43.232
employee number ER28-0652.

07:45.068 --> 07:46.072
Elliot!

07:46.073 --> 07:49.081
In here.

07:52.092 --> 07:54.099
- What's up?
- El.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.672
All over the price...
Yeah, I can totally...

08:02.673 --> 08:03.979
I can totally handle it.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.986
They were hacked again last night.

08:07.143 --> 08:08.015
Gideon...

08:08.016 --> 08:09.711
That's my childhood friend Angela.

08:09.712 --> 08:11.734
She can be a bit high strung sometimes,

08:11.735 --> 08:13.849
but trust me... she's one of the good ones.

08:14.167 --> 08:14.976
What am I looking at?

08:14.977 --> 08:17.508
Is this the log file?
This was a RUDY attack.

08:18.181 --> 08:19.185
This is awesome.

08:19.186 --> 08:20.711
- Gideon, will you answer me?
- Awesome?

08:20.712 --> 08:23.198
You think this is awesome?
This is killing us, Elliot.

08:23.199 --> 08:25.717
- Gideon, I'm not...
- Angela!

08:25.718 --> 08:28.215
Let's just see how this meeting goes today.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.818
Their networks are getting
attacked every week.

08:30.819 --> 08:33.232
Who knows if they'll
still even be a client.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.532
- They're coming in?
- Hey, what did we say

08:36.533 --> 08:39.763
about the dress code?

08:40.760 --> 08:42.232
All right, now, look over those logs.

08:42.232 --> 08:44.810
And be ready this afternoon in
case they have any questions.

08:44.811 --> 08:48.085
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:51.110 --> 08:53.863
- Start smoking again?
- Did you not get my texts last night?

08:53.864 --> 08:56.223
I sent you exactly 13 of them.

08:56.224 --> 08:58.348
Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

09:01.329 --> 09:04.087
You promised me that you
were gonna try this time.

09:18.991 --> 09:19.994
Stop thinking about something else

09:19.995 --> 09:22.001
when I'm talking to you.

09:22.701 --> 09:24.254
I hate when you do that.

09:24.255 --> 09:27.464
Sorry. I was thinking about work.

09:27.799 --> 09:29.799
Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.799
He thanks me all the
time for bringing you in.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.011
But for some reason, I think
you secretly hate it here.

09:35.799 --> 09:37.799
She was right. I liked most of the people,

09:37.800 --> 09:39.690
but our business, a cyber security firm

09:39.691 --> 09:43.434
that protects corporations... I
can't think of anything I hate more.

09:43.435 --> 09:47.283
No, I love it here.

09:51.799 --> 09:55.263
I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.

09:56.599 --> 09:59.055
I'm late on my last two
student loan payments,

09:59.056 --> 10:01.799
and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

10:02.499 --> 10:04.499
- Hey...
- Hi.

10:05.399 --> 10:07.661
Yo, buddy. Missed you last night.

10:07.662 --> 10:09.807
- Where were you?
- Gotta go. Big meeting today.

10:13.299 --> 10:15.878
- Did you find out what happened?
- Yeah.

10:15.879 --> 10:17.536
He said he was working.

10:17.537 --> 10:18.836
Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.

10:18.837 --> 10:20.122
We're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

10:20.123 --> 10:23.074
He can't stand me. And you know why.

10:23.075 --> 10:27.389
Angela, I can't have that
kind of negativity in my life.

10:28.399 --> 10:31.799
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.799
What are you thinking about?

10:45.800 --> 10:46.799
Nothing.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.799
You want to know what I'm thinking about?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.799
First time you came to me.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.366
I didn't exactly come to Krista.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.799
I was forced here. But I do like her.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.348
Hacking her was simple.
Her password: Dylan 2791.

11:02.349 --> 11:05.639
Favorite artist and the year in
which she was born, backwards.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.610
Though she's a psychologist,

11:07.611 --> 11:09.345
she's really bad at reading people.

11:09.346 --> 11:11.399
But I'm good at reading people.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.933
My secret: I look for the worst in them.

11:15.699 --> 11:17.699
I know she went through
a divorce four years ago.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.699
I know she was devastated by it

11:18.700 --> 11:21.699
and has been dating losers
on eHarmony ever since.

11:24.999 --> 11:27.999
Her most recent foray... Michael Hansen.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.113
I searched for him online,
but nothing came up.

11:31.114 --> 11:33.403
No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing.

11:33.404 --> 11:35.202
Something about him bugs me,

11:35.203 --> 11:36.845
scratching that part of my mind again.

11:36.846 --> 11:39.364
But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.400
I know you're not yelling like before,

11:41.401 --> 11:42.699
which is good.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.899
But I can tell you're
still holding on to it.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.470
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

11:48.471 --> 11:51.199
You're angry at everyone, at society...

11:51.200 --> 11:52.161
Fuck society.

11:52.562 --> 11:54.299
I know you have a lot to be angry about,

11:54.300 --> 11:57.058
but keeping it to yourself and
staying quiet like you're doing...

11:57.108 --> 11:59.807
it's not going to help you.

12:00.401 --> 12:03.882
There's pain underneath. That's
where our work needs to go.

12:07.839 --> 12:11.855
What is it about society
that disappoints you so much?

12:18.255 --> 12:20.608
Oh, I don't know.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.481
Is it that we collectively
thought Steve Jobs

12:23.482 --> 12:25.432
was a great man, even when we knew

12:25.433 --> 12:29.850
he made billions off the backs of children?

12:29.851 --> 12:34.027
Or maybe it's that it feels like
all our heroes are counterfeit.

12:34.272 --> 12:37.387
The world itself's just one big hoax.

12:38.190 --> 12:41.443
Spamming with our running
commentary of bullshit

12:41.444 --> 12:46.421
masquerading as insight, our
social media faking as intimacy.

12:48.108 --> 12:51.110
Or is it that we voted for this?

12:51.111 --> 12:53.345
Not with our rigged
elections, but with our things,

12:53.346 --> 12:55.517
our property, our money.

12:55.518 --> 12:58.234
I'm not saying anything new.
We all know why we do this,

12:58.235 --> 13:00.791
not because Hunger Games
books makes us happy

13:01.176 --> 13:03.342
but because we wanna be sedated.

13:03.343 --> 13:05.352
Because it's painful not to pretend,

13:05.353 --> 13:08.666
because we're cowards.

13:08.667 --> 13:11.642
Fuck society.

13:11.643 --> 13:14.733
Elliot. You're not saying anything.

13:16.059 --> 13:19.103
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.710
Don't be frustrated.

13:26.127 --> 13:30.590
- Why shouldn't I be?
- You're different than most.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.509
You at least try.

13:35.263 --> 13:37.729
You at least understand.

13:38.133 --> 13:43.614
- Understand what?
- What it's like to feel alone.

13:45.596 --> 13:47.621
You understand the pain.

13:48.121 --> 13:51.159
You want to protect people from it.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.097
You want to protect me from it.

13:55.623 --> 13:58.247
I respect that about you.

14:02.932 --> 14:03.924
Why do you think I know

14:03.925 --> 14:07.918
- what it's like to feel alone?
- Shit! From her emails!

14:07.919 --> 14:11.094
- Elliot?
- I don't know.

14:14.390 --> 14:16.454
Let's talk about last night.

14:16.455 --> 14:20.389
Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

14:24.710 --> 14:26.651
Yeah. It was nice.

14:26.652 --> 14:30.738
- Did you try to talk to anyone?
- Sure.

14:31.234 --> 14:33.298
I got a girl's number.

14:33.299 --> 14:35.362
You did?

14:35.363 --> 14:37.426
She's cute.

14:37.427 --> 14:40.522
She likes The Hunger Games.

14:43.118 --> 14:46.896
You're hiding again, Elliot.

14:48.278 --> 14:51.610
When you hide, your delusions come back.

14:51.611 --> 14:54.486
It's a slippery slope.

14:56.666 --> 14:59.585
Let's talk about the men
in black you've been seeing.

14:59.586 --> 15:04.784
- Are they still there?
- No,

15:05.238 --> 15:07.464
I... told you they're gone.

15:07.465 --> 15:10.799
The meds you gave me are working.

15:16.285 --> 15:17.303
Yo, man.

15:17.304 --> 15:19.303
Do you wanna, uh...

15:19.304 --> 15:22.301
- you wanna do lunch today?
- Uh, yeah...

15:22.302 --> 15:24.345
- I got other plans.
- Other plans. Right.

15:24.346 --> 15:28.499
That's... what you said the
last three times I asked you.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.494
Look, bud, you... and Angela

15:31.495 --> 15:33.491
have been close for a long time,

15:33.492 --> 15:36.486
and that's even more
reason why I want us to be

15:36.487 --> 15:38.483
on good terms.

15:38.484 --> 15:42.141
I... I just... I feel like things
have been awkward between us.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.666
- Don't you?
- I'm okay

15:44.667 --> 15:47.482
with it being awkward between us.

15:47.483 --> 15:51.764
Um, yeah. I... I'm...
I'm not okay with that.

15:52.563 --> 15:56.620
Um... look, man, I love
Angela, and I want us to...

15:56.621 --> 15:59.582
to get along for her sake.
I mean, that's what I'm...

15:59.583 --> 16:02.545
that's what I'm here for. I just, I...

16:02.546 --> 16:06.049
- I don't normally do stuff...
- Am I crazy not to like this guy?

16:06.382 --> 16:08.086
Among some of his Facebook likes

16:08.087 --> 16:10.067
are George W. Bush's Decision Points,

16:10.068 --> 16:12.047
Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen,

16:12.048 --> 16:15.018
and the music of Josh Groban.

16:15.019 --> 16:17.677
Must I really justify myself any further?

16:17.678 --> 16:19.498
I'm working on that shit, you know?

16:20.461 --> 16:24.189
His was the easiest to hack.
Password was 123456Seven.

16:25.789 --> 16:29.088
I witnessed his first "I love
you" with Angela over Gchat,

16:29.089 --> 16:33.550
then I witnessed the first of
many infidelities with Stella B.

16:35.102 --> 16:36.485
I've never done anything
like this before...

16:36.486 --> 16:37.803
I've thought about telling Angela,

16:37.804 --> 16:40.380
but she has shitty taste in
men, and I'm not quite ready

16:40.381 --> 16:42.304
to see what comes after this just yet.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.436
You like music. I like music.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.465
Maroon 5.

16:45.466 --> 16:48.144
Plus I can manage Ollie
easier than the others.

16:48.145 --> 16:49.538
For now, anyway.

16:49.539 --> 16:50.523
And that's all I mean.

16:50.524 --> 16:52.552
I just want you to know that.

16:52.953 --> 16:54.982
I like you, bro, and...

16:54.983 --> 16:57.012
I want you to like me too.

16:57.930 --> 17:00.056
I understand.

17:00.057 --> 17:01.795
I'll try harder.

17:01.796 --> 17:03.749
That's cool, man.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.906
Hey, whenever you're
ready, I'd love to just...

17:08.175 --> 17:09.915
chill.

17:12.994 --> 17:14.382
Oh... forgot about your...

17:14.383 --> 17:16.365
no touching thing.

17:19.429 --> 17:22.621
Truth is, I shouldn't hate
Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

17:22.622 --> 17:24.665
He's too dumb to be bad.

17:25.644 --> 17:29.232
In fact, when I think about
the really bad people...

17:31.312 --> 17:35.093
E Corp, the largest
conglomerate in the world...

17:35.094 --> 17:38.857
they're so big, they're
literally everywhere.

17:39.258 --> 17:42.079
A perfect monster of modern society.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.901
The E might as well stand for Evil.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.506
- And all of life's necessities...
- In fact, after a thorough,

17:48.507 --> 17:51.035
intensive self-reprogramming,
that's all my mind hears,

17:51.036 --> 17:53.142
sees, or reads when
they pop up in my world.

17:53.143 --> 17:54.546
That was have to offer.

17:54.547 --> 17:57.499
Together, we can change
the world, with E...

17:57.500 --> 17:59.499
Evil Corp.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.031
Krista would have a shit
fit if she knew I did that.

18:02.032 --> 18:05.771
But that's what they are...
a conglomerate of evil.

18:06.099 --> 18:09.070
- And now I have to help them.
- There are six on-site engineers

18:09.071 --> 18:10.310
on your account.

18:10.311 --> 18:13.646
- Plus a few off-site...
- There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.

18:14.299 --> 18:15.989
Even though he's the head technology guy

18:15.990 --> 18:19.386
at one of the biggest companies
in the world, he owns a Blackberry.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.296
So this is it right here.

18:22.297 --> 18:25.017
But also looks like he doesn't
see a terminal very often

18:25.018 --> 18:27.351
He's not a techie. He's a moron.

18:28.439 --> 18:31.924
An arrogant moron. The worst kind.

18:37.502 --> 18:40.137
Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

18:40.138 --> 18:42.534
I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

18:43.602 --> 18:48.427
- Elliot. Just a tech.
- Don't be so humble.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.314
You know, I started out
exactly where you are,

18:51.315 --> 18:54.359
and... to be honest, you
know, my heart is still there.

18:55.077 --> 18:57.884
So I see you're running Gnome.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.228
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

19:01.229 --> 19:04.335
I know this desktop environment
is supposed to be better but...

19:04.932 --> 19:06.324
you know what they say.

19:06.325 --> 19:10.437
- Old habits... they die hard.
- An executive running Linux with...

19:10.438 --> 19:12.109
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.198
I'm an executive. I mean...

19:14.199 --> 19:16.193
why am I even running Linux?

19:16.906 --> 19:19.199
Again... old habits.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.459
It's gonna be fun working with you.

19:24.999 --> 19:27.999
I should join the rest of the group.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.999
Bonsoir, Elliot.

19:36.699 --> 19:39.699
Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

19:42.999 --> 19:46.222
Saving everyone from the invisible hand,

19:46.223 --> 19:48.999
one that brands us with an employee badge.

19:51.999 --> 19:55.035
The one that forces us to work for them...

19:56.272 --> 19:59.921
The one that controls us every
day without us knowing it.

20:01.550 --> 20:03.999
But I can't stop it.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.999
I'm not that special.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
I'm just anonymous.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.999
I'm just alone.

20:15.566 --> 20:17.788
If it weren't for Qwerty,

20:17.789 --> 20:19.999
I'd be completely empty.

20:25.999 --> 20:29.252
I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness.

20:31.137 --> 20:32.734
This crying has been happening too often,

20:32.735 --> 20:34.827
every other week now.

20:38.699 --> 20:41.699
What do normal people do
when they get this sad?

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
They reach out to friends
or family, I think.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
That's not an option.

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
I do morphine.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.844
The key to doing morphine
without turning into a junkie

21:00.845 --> 21:03.725
is to limit yourself
to 30 milligrams a day.

21:03.726 --> 21:04.973
Anything more

21:04.974 --> 21:07.899
just builds up your tolerance.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.999
I check every pill I get for purity.

21:11.689 --> 21:13.999
I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance

21:14.000 --> 21:15.999
in case I go through withdrawals.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.999
Shit! I'm out again.

21:22.374 --> 21:26.293
- How much?
- On the house.

21:26.594 --> 21:29.699
No, Shayla. Not doing that.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.299
Okay? This is just a regular drug deal

21:32.300 --> 21:34.299
- like it always is.
- Fine.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.034
So what are you you to tonight?

21:36.035 --> 21:37.999
'Cause I tried to post
something on your Facebook

21:38.000 --> 21:39.659
and couldn't find you.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.527
I'm not on Facebook.

21:41.528 --> 21:45.139
- What? Why not?
- 'Cause I hate Facebook.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.999
That's crazy.

21:51.260 --> 21:54.679
Well... you want to do these together then?

21:55.102 --> 21:57.700
Pure Molly...

22:10.699 --> 22:13.330
Don't ever make decisions
when you're on morphine.

22:24.399 --> 22:27.399
Instagram check-in for
Krista at Pierre Loti.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.013
Okay, Michael Hansen.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.457
Time to find out who you really are.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.399
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.299
Taxi!

23:30.299 --> 23:35.299
Uh, hi... I just left my
keys in one of your cabs.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.299
56Y2.

23:38.599 --> 23:39.599
Sure.

23:42.699 --> 23:44.699
What about you two? Huh?

23:45.299 --> 23:47.299
You guys got any spare change?

23:47.899 --> 23:49.698
Help me out?

23:49.699 --> 23:51.899
New York's expensive, guys. Come on.

23:53.235 --> 23:55.999
306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.500
Come on, asshole. Piss already.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.080
Come on!

24:22.081 --> 24:23.699
Come on! Will you... will you go?

24:23.700 --> 24:24.925
- Come on, go, go!
- Hey!

24:25.226 --> 24:26.513
Go, will ya?

24:26.514 --> 24:28.000
Hey.

24:31.718 --> 24:32.999
May I borrow your phone?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.999
Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.399
Thank you.

25:04.499 --> 25:06.499
No answer. Thanks anyway.

25:23.671 --> 25:27.873
- Angela, is everything okay?
- I need you to come to AllSafe.

25:28.499 --> 25:30.173
You're there? It's 3:00 in the morning.

25:30.174 --> 25:33.259
They attacked Evil Corp servers
again, but it's bad this time.

25:33.260 --> 25:34.100
It's a DDoS attack.

25:35.099 --> 25:37.877
- Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.
- Yeah, he's here.

25:38.596 --> 25:42.684
- Is he talking to their tech department?
- He's online with them, but so far nothing.

25:44.399 --> 25:47.131
I don't think that Lloyd can handle this.

25:48.199 --> 25:49.902
Look, Gideon just put me on this account.

25:49.903 --> 25:51.572
I can't screw up in my first week.

25:51.573 --> 25:54.199
I need you. Please.

25:55.699 --> 25:57.441
I'll be right there.

26:08.299 --> 26:11.207
- Finally!
- Calm down... it's only been an hour.

26:11.208 --> 26:16.026
Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is
like $13 million in revenue, approximately.

26:16.027 --> 26:17.661
Actually, I calculated that.

26:17.662 --> 26:19.673
That's exactly how much they lost.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.926
Don't worry. I got you.

26:22.862 --> 26:24.299
Lloyd, what's up?

26:24.300 --> 26:26.299
Lloyd!

26:26.799 --> 26:29.386
Elliot. This is bad.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.968
Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

26:30.969 --> 26:33.541
- Did you reconfigure the DNS?
- Yes!

26:33.542 --> 26:35.783
- Stop the services.
- I already stopped the services,

26:35.784 --> 26:38.160
tries to reboot the servers
but they're not coming back up.

26:38.399 --> 26:41.415
Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting
their entire network right now.

26:58.613 --> 27:01.082
They just started reporting on the outage.

27:08.799 --> 27:11.575
Shit. This is worse than I
thought. They're in the network?

27:11.576 --> 27:13.518
What's the status update?

27:13.519 --> 27:16.023
He's here. I thought we
set up security protocols

27:16.024 --> 27:19.419
so that this doesn't happen.

27:19.744 --> 27:21.788
- Where's the attack coming from?
- Everywhere, obviously.

27:21.789 --> 27:25.210
- The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait...
- Start restarting the services, load sharing,

27:25.211 --> 27:27.348
redirect the traffic.
Call Prolexic for help.

27:27.968 --> 27:31.634
- Wait. What?
- I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.

27:33.599 --> 27:36.046
I think they got a rootkit
sitting inside the servers.

27:36.372 --> 27:38.927
- What's a rootkit?
- It's like a crazy serial

27:38.928 --> 27:40.399
rapist with a very big dick.

27:40.803 --> 27:44.387
- Jesus, Lloyd.
- Sorry. It's malicious code that completely

27:44.388 --> 27:46.961
takes over their system.
It can delete system files

27:46.962 --> 27:49.494
and stop programs. Viruses, worms...

27:49.495 --> 27:51.202
- How do we stop it?
- That's the thing.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.345
It's fundamentally
invisible... you can't stop it.

27:53.346 --> 27:54.719
All of their servers are timing out.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.034
None of them are coming back up.

27:56.299 --> 27:58.143
That's because every
time we restart the server

27:58.144 --> 28:00.105
the virus replicates itself during boot up

28:00.106 --> 28:01.242
and crashes the host.

28:01.243 --> 28:02.410
_

28:02.631 --> 28:04.282
How are we supposed to bring up the network

28:04.283 --> 28:08.084
- if we can't restart the servers?
- We can't.

28:09.001 --> 28:11.299
Which is what they wanted.

28:11.586 --> 28:14.791
By defending ourselves, we ended
up spreading the virus everywhere.

28:15.859 --> 28:16.998
Only thing we can do

28:16.999 --> 28:19.299
is we've gotta take the
whole system offline,

28:19.300 --> 28:22.328
wipe the infected servers
clean, then bring them back up.

28:24.884 --> 28:26.299
You're coming with me.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.274
- Yeah.
- Lloyd.

28:28.275 --> 28:30.502
Tell everybody to start
taking everything offline.

28:30.503 --> 28:33.220
- On it.
- Uh, the server farm in Dulles.

28:33.221 --> 28:34.824
We're gonna need the jet.

28:49.300 --> 28:51.145
They're booting the network back up.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.967
Now, you're downloading
the logs, right because...

28:52.968 --> 28:54.909
- Stop. Tell him to stop.
- What?

28:54.910 --> 28:57.199
Don't start the boot
sequence. You guys missed one.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.964
There's an infected server up and running.

29:00.899 --> 29:02.899
What's the ETA before it hits this server?

29:08.599 --> 29:10.599
The backup server up and running?

29:10.600 --> 29:13.373
It's ready, but it's not
configured for auto switch.

29:19.104 --> 29:21.805
We need to redirect the
traffic, need to switch DNS.

29:25.399 --> 29:27.861
You got this, you got this, you got this.

29:29.515 --> 29:32.452
- This is impossible.
- You got this, you got this, you got this.

29:33.074 --> 29:35.423
It's almost at the back server!

29:43.749 --> 29:45.400
We still up?

29:52.222 --> 29:55.894
We're okay.

29:56.099 --> 29:59.137
Yeah.

30:07.116 --> 30:08.725
Hank.

30:08.726 --> 30:10.527
I'm gonna take a look at
the infected server, okay?

30:10.528 --> 30:14.806
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah. Uh... I'll meet you at the elevators.

30:21.072 --> 30:22.835
They must have left a mark or something.

30:22.836 --> 30:24.752
Every hacker loves attention.

30:24.753 --> 30:27.479
They don't just do DDoS
attacks for no reason.

30:33.821 --> 30:36.626
This is it. Fsociety.

30:37.099 --> 30:39.099
Is that supposed to be a joke?

30:39.100 --> 30:42.471
This was way too easy. They
didn't hide it well at all.

30:44.431 --> 30:46.083
_

30:46.958 --> 30:49.189
_

30:50.033 --> 30:52.485
This note is for me.

30:53.499 --> 30:55.885
They're telling me to leave it here.

30:55.886 --> 30:59.152
But why? Doesn't matter.

30:59.153 --> 31:01.376
Time to shut them down.

31:04.991 --> 31:06.568
Why can't I delete it?

31:06.569 --> 31:09.081
I don't want to delete
it. I want it to stay.

31:09.082 --> 31:11.299
What's wrong with me?

31:18.300 --> 31:20.735
I'll reconfigure the
access to the root directory

31:20.736 --> 31:23.957
so only I can use it. And no one will know.

31:28.299 --> 31:29.702
For you, sir.

31:35.480 --> 31:40.302
- Did you know that I'm gay?
- Uh...

31:43.499 --> 31:46.331
- No.
- Hmm.

31:49.199 --> 31:53.199
Consider this me coming
out to you then, okay?

31:53.799 --> 31:55.799
It's hard because I don't
like to talk about my sex life.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.799
But my partner, he gets very paranoid.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.799
He thinks I'm ashamed of...

32:02.800 --> 32:05.799
He wants me to be more public about it, so,

32:05.800 --> 32:08.799
Anyway, I'm gay.

32:12.499 --> 32:14.499
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

32:20.099 --> 32:24.007
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.099
Hackers have a short attention span.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.829
They'll get bored, harass someone else.

32:28.830 --> 32:33.899
Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us.

32:33.900 --> 32:37.036
And I don't know if I can blame them.

32:38.899 --> 32:41.733
They could have called
their other security teams.

32:41.734 --> 32:43.684
- Mm.
- They called you.

32:44.899 --> 32:46.800
Well, somebody over there likes us,

32:46.801 --> 32:49.736
but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure.

32:49.737 --> 32:53.722
And he calls the shots.

32:53.723 --> 32:56.899
Evil Corp is 80% of our business.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.899
If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.805
It's gonna be it...

33:03.000 --> 33:04.899
For me.

33:13.352 --> 33:15.502
I feel like I can talk to you.

33:17.199 --> 33:19.845
I mean, more than the others, anyway.

33:20.899 --> 33:25.298
I'm sure, in a weird way,
you'll be happy if we went under.

33:25.999 --> 33:28.480
Oh, come on. Come on.

33:29.699 --> 33:32.573
I know you hate wearing
those stupid shirts.

33:41.899 --> 33:43.899
Gideon?

33:46.099 --> 33:49.099
I promise I'll find them.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.874
Evil Corp service should
be back up soon enough.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.855
I'll take a look at the dat
file. I'll ask my IRC contacts

34:07.856 --> 34:09.649
about fsociety when I get home.

34:09.650 --> 34:11.706
I've never seen their
name on the boards though.

34:11.706 --> 34:13.899
They've gotta be new, but they're good.

34:20.899 --> 34:22.899
Rough night?

34:28.899 --> 34:30.518
I'm getting off here.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.699
I think you should come with me.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.899
But only if you didn't delete it.

34:36.900 --> 34:40.472
You deleted it, we got
nothing to talk about.

34:40.899 --> 34:43.761
Are you talking to me?

34:46.199 --> 34:50.150
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

35:02.699 --> 35:07.529
- Who are you?
- We gotta wait for the Q.

35:14.899 --> 35:18.919
- Then what?
- Then we're going to Brooklyn.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.735
Out by Coney Island.

35:22.140 --> 35:23.575
Why?

35:24.248 --> 35:28.425
What's there?

35:28.899 --> 35:32.899
Obviously you're gonna
ask a lot of questions.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.873
It's weird what you're
doing right now, I get it.

35:37.799 --> 35:40.799
I... I can't tell you
anything until we get there.

35:48.999 --> 35:51.013
Can't smoke in here.

35:55.699 --> 35:57.785
You've been following me.

35:58.786 --> 36:00.553
Why?

36:02.699 --> 36:05.699
What do you want from me?

36:09.699 --> 36:12.699
My dad was a petty thief.

36:12.700 --> 36:14.699
Never could hold down a job.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.953
So, he just robbed,
convenience stores, shops,

36:17.954 --> 36:20.023
small-time stuff.

36:20.699 --> 36:23.549
One time, he sat me down, he
told me something I never forgot.

36:23.699 --> 36:28.411
He said, "Everyone steals.
That's how it works.

36:28.412 --> 36:32.545
You think people out there are
getting exactly what they deserve? No.

36:32.546 --> 36:34.699
They're getting paid over or under,

36:34.700 --> 36:38.088
but someone in the chain
always gets bamboozled.

36:40.295 --> 36:44.699
I steal, son, but I don't get caught.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.699
That's my contract with society.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.699
Now if you can catch me
stealing, I'll go to jail.

36:49.700 --> 36:54.396
But if you can't, then
I've earned the money."

36:58.108 --> 37:00.418
I respected that, man.

37:02.699 --> 37:06.935
I thought that shit was
cool as a little kid.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.699
A few years after that,

37:12.700 --> 37:15.699
they finally caught him.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.764
Sent him to jail.

37:17.765 --> 37:21.975
Dies five years later.
My respect goes with him.

37:24.699 --> 37:28.556
I thought he was free doing
what he did, but he wasn't.

37:30.153 --> 37:32.365
He was in prison.

37:33.699 --> 37:36.551
Just like you are now, Elliot.

37:38.699 --> 37:41.699
But I'm gonna break you out.

38:37.881 --> 38:43.532
- Why would you guys actually meet IRL?
- You remember that hacker group O-Megz?

38:43.533 --> 38:45.374
They got outed by their
own leader to the FBI,

38:45.375 --> 38:47.067
and six hackers went to prison for it?

38:47.068 --> 38:48.530
You know how they got 'em?

38:48.531 --> 38:50.095
They went on the dude's computer,

38:50.096 --> 38:55.713
tracked 'em all down through emails,
VPN sessions, chat messages, texts.

38:55.714 --> 38:57.699
One guy, and the whole thing comes down.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.819
- It's what's called...
- A central point of failure.

38:59.820 --> 39:03.185
Right. Because they
refused to meet in person,

39:03.186 --> 39:07.141
they compromised each other every time
they sent so much as a smiley face.

39:07.142 --> 39:11.764
The rule here is, it's
done here, and only here.

39:13.699 --> 39:17.102
It ends when you walk out that
door, and begins when you walk in.

39:17.103 --> 39:21.141
Our encryption is the real world.

39:21.699 --> 39:24.762
- How do you talk to each other then?
- We don't.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.683
We come and go, work on
the project when we can.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.699
- How do you trust them?
- I give them an exercise.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.691
If they pass, they join us.

39:35.899 --> 39:38.584
- If they fail...
- The DDoS attack last night,

39:40.249 --> 39:42.469
you were testing me.

39:49.284 --> 39:51.418
You said there was a project.

39:51.829 --> 39:54.966
- What's the project?
- That'll come later.

39:54.967 --> 39:57.328
I just wanted you to see the place.

40:02.999 --> 40:05.999
There's not much you can do without a CPU.

40:10.999 --> 40:12.356
I'm crazy.

40:12.357 --> 40:14.999
I have to be crazy because
that didn't just happen, right?

40:15.000 --> 40:19.013
This is a delusion. Is this a
delusion? Shit, I'm a schizo.

40:20.999 --> 40:24.073
Have I really lost it this time?
No, no. Last night happened.

40:24.074 --> 40:26.438
It was real. Angela called
me. I was at AllSafe.

40:26.439 --> 40:27.999
Evil Corp's servers were compromised.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.999
Those are facts, not delusions.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.608
I know. I know, I know I
realize I'm saying all of this

40:32.609 --> 40:36.057
to an imaginary person, but I created you.

40:36.058 --> 40:38.493
I didn't create this.

40:38.999 --> 40:41.181
Oh, thank God you're here.

40:41.182 --> 40:43.827
I was just about to go
wait in the Starbucks.

40:44.599 --> 40:46.182
You live in a bad neighborhood.

40:46.183 --> 40:48.836
- Do you know that?
- I do know that.

40:49.399 --> 40:54.149
Do you want to get high and
watch your favorite movie?

40:54.999 --> 40:58.611
Oh, you saved our asses last night. I
thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.129
Where have you been?

41:01.130 --> 41:06.972
- I thought you'd be sleeping.
- I... yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.564
That sounds like such a lie,

41:12.799 --> 41:15.770
but, whatever. I don't want
to get into that right now.

41:16.071 --> 41:18.154
So you want to do this?

41:23.499 --> 41:26.839
I miss Qwerty. I hope she still loves me.

41:34.799 --> 41:36.799
Shit.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.972
She wasn't supposed to be here, okay?

41:38.973 --> 41:42.031
- Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.
- That's okay.

41:42.032 --> 41:45.951
Um... This is great.

41:46.701 --> 41:48.997
- Elliot, I'm happy for you.
- No, it's not like that.

41:48.998 --> 41:53.540
Well, maybe it should be, you
know? It's good that you're...

41:55.699 --> 41:57.564
dating.

42:00.599 --> 42:02.133
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

42:02.599 --> 42:04.599
We can do movie night next time.

42:05.280 --> 42:08.317
- I promise, okay?
- Yeah.

42:15.099 --> 42:17.006
Have fun.

42:29.599 --> 42:33.375
Mm, Elliot?

42:33.991 --> 42:38.772
Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

42:38.773 --> 42:41.840
- Shayla.
- I have to move my car.

42:41.841 --> 42:45.757
Shayla, leave.

42:48.116 --> 42:49.599
Now.

42:52.952 --> 42:54.770
No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere.

42:54.771 --> 42:56.599
No mention of fsociety.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.116
Not on any of the hacker boards.

42:58.117 --> 43:02.011
Not on IRC, forums, blogs,
no one's heard of them.

43:05.914 --> 43:09.979
Property was owned by Fun Society
Amusement, LLC for 13 years.

43:10.499 --> 43:12.839
Owner was shot a killed
a year and a half ago.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.315
No owner since.

43:14.616 --> 43:17.999
And the ownership history before
that is sparse to nonexistent.

43:18.399 --> 43:21.533
This guy is good. Very good.

43:26.909 --> 43:31.135
Doesn't matter. Their arcade
network's IP is in the DAT file.

43:34.599 --> 43:37.409
That'll be enough to turn them in.

43:51.699 --> 43:53.699
What's your ask, Mr. Robot?

44:04.599 --> 44:06.692
Hey, man,

44:07.950 --> 44:12.241
- where's your boss?
- Okay, cut the bullshit.

44:12.529 --> 44:15.628
When are you going to give us
access to the root directory?

44:16.599 --> 44:19.007
What? Dude, come on.

44:19.008 --> 44:20.599
I wrote that rootkit.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.599
I still have to put
Colby's IP in the DAT file.

44:29.799 --> 44:31.683
Dickhead.

44:33.499 --> 44:35.951
Elliot! Good news.

44:35.952 --> 44:38.008
I scored the last bag of
Twinkies from Gristedes.

44:38.009 --> 44:41.993
- You want one?
- She just called me a dickhead.

44:42.639 --> 44:45.366
Yeah, that's Darlene.

44:45.367 --> 44:49.379
Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

44:52.599 --> 44:54.662
Ah, it's beautiful.

44:54.899 --> 44:57.145
Gets better the higher up you go, you know?

44:58.599 --> 45:01.599
Oh, I love it up here.

45:02.175 --> 45:07.283
- You like it?
- I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in.

45:07.931 --> 45:11.454
- I'm giving them all the information.
- Let me tell you why you're really here.

45:12.599 --> 45:16.108
You're here because you sense
something wrong with the world.

45:16.109 --> 45:18.668
Something you can't explain.

45:19.177 --> 45:20.760
But...

45:20.761 --> 45:23.519
you know it controls you
and everyone you care about.

45:24.479 --> 45:26.506
What are you talking about?

45:29.453 --> 45:31.193
Money.

45:31.499 --> 45:35.372
Money hasn't been real since
we got off the gold standard.

45:35.373 --> 45:37.044
It's become virtual.

45:37.045 --> 45:40.723
Software. The operating
system of our world.

45:41.402 --> 45:46.952
And, Elliot, we are on the verge
of taking down this virtual reality.

45:49.348 --> 45:50.885
Think about it.

45:51.434 --> 45:55.634
What if you could take
down one conglomerate?

45:56.253 --> 45:59.631
A conglomerate so deeply entrenched

45:59.632 --> 46:04.378
in the world's economy, that
too big to fail to describing it.

46:04.968 --> 46:07.445
You want to create
another financial meltdown

46:07.446 --> 46:11.017
like the one we just had, but way worse.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.712
Yeah, why would I want that?

46:13.059 --> 46:14.358
Everyone would lose their money.

46:14.359 --> 46:16.440
What if I told you that this conglomerate

46:16.441 --> 46:20.110
just so happens to own 70% of the
global consumer credit industry?

46:20.111 --> 46:22.686
Huh? If we hit their
data center just right,

46:22.687 --> 46:25.019
we could systematically
format all the servers,

46:25.020 --> 46:27.129
- including backup.
- That would erase all...

46:27.130 --> 46:29.350
All the debt we owe them.

46:29.351 --> 46:32.528
Every record of every credit
card, loan, and mortgage

46:32.529 --> 46:33.991
would be wiped clean.

46:35.062 --> 46:36.293
It would be impossible to reinforce

46:36.295 --> 46:37.758
outdated paper records.

46:37.760 --> 46:40.788
It would all be gone.

46:40.790 --> 46:43.387
The single biggest incident

46:43.389 --> 46:47.450
of wealth redistribution in history.

46:53.047 --> 46:57.308
Evil Corp. The conglomerate.

46:57.310 --> 46:59.206
That's why you picked me.

46:59.208 --> 47:00.772
Because I work at AllSafe.

47:00.774 --> 47:03.936
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit

47:03.938 --> 47:07.999
from the FBI and the U.S. Cyber Command.

47:08.001 --> 47:12.429
You are going to modify the DAT file

47:12.431 --> 47:17.258
and put Colby's terminal
IP address in there.

47:17.260 --> 47:19.889
Terry Colby?

47:19.891 --> 47:24.019
You're gonna frame him? No
one's gonna believe that.

47:24.021 --> 47:26.316
I met him, he's a moron.

47:26.318 --> 47:28.182
So are the FBI.

47:28.184 --> 47:29.914
Even if they don't believe he did it,

47:29.916 --> 47:33.311
they'll believe he gave
someone access to it.

47:33.313 --> 47:34.877
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

47:34.879 --> 47:37.775
- What good will that do?
- You don't take down a conglomerate

47:37.776 --> 47:39.706
by shooting them in the heart.

47:39.708 --> 47:41.271
That's the thing about conglomerates,

47:41.273 --> 47:43.269
they don't have hearts.

47:43.271 --> 47:46.034
You take them down limb by limb.

47:46.036 --> 47:47.433
And as they unravel,

47:47.435 --> 47:50.697
their illusion of control unravels.

47:56.693 --> 48:01.605
- Who are you?
- That'll come later.

48:01.656 --> 48:06.283
Right now, you have a lot to think about.

48:06.285 --> 48:08.914
You have to change the DAT file

48:08.916 --> 48:11.978
and put Colby's IP in there.

48:14.645 --> 48:17.174
You do that,

48:17.176 --> 48:19.339
you have set in motion
the largest revolution

48:19.341 --> 48:22.703
the world will ever see.

50:55.183 --> 51:00.737
- So, what do we got?
- So, if you'll take a look

51:00.738 --> 51:02.235
at the first page of your agenda...

51:02.237 --> 51:05.699
You're the one who stopped the hack.

51:05.701 --> 51:08.796
You know, the gals in analysis
said this was a tough one.

51:08.798 --> 51:10.229
All things being equal,

51:10.231 --> 51:12.793
it should have shut us down for days, so...

51:12.795 --> 51:15.224
you did good.

51:15.226 --> 51:18.754
Okay.

51:18.756 --> 51:22.152
We should start with our
account executive, Angela.

51:22.154 --> 51:23.950
Okay, we first noticed the breach

51:23.952 --> 51:27.947
at 2:07 A.M. Eastern
Standard on Friday night.

51:28.354 --> 51:32.363
- You mean, Saturday?
- Sorry, yes,

51:32.364 --> 51:34.378
technically, Saturday morning.

51:34.379 --> 51:36.905
Yeah, okay, Angela,
that's what we're here for.

51:36.907 --> 51:39.204
The technicals.

51:39.998 --> 51:41.325
Right.

51:42.001 --> 51:45.581
Yes. Anyway, he arrived at the office

51:45.582 --> 51:47.707
- at 2:35 and I instru...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

51:48.708 --> 51:50.339
So that's almost a half hour
after the initial breach.

51:50.340 --> 51:52.179
Why didn't anyone pipe
in from their laptops?

51:52.180 --> 51:54.458
- It's not protocol...
- It wouldn't have been secure

51:54.460 --> 51:57.855
if someone terminaled in on this.

51:57.857 --> 52:01.552
It was the smarter move
to have someone come in

52:01.554 --> 52:04.511
- so they can log in on a secure line.
- Exactly.

52:04.512 --> 52:06.824
- Then Lloyd was able to...
- Just... just actually,

52:06.825 --> 52:08.738
just one second.

52:08.980 --> 52:13.075
Yeah.

52:21.837 --> 52:23.933
You know, I, uh,

52:23.935 --> 52:27.962
I always loved this view.

52:42.819 --> 52:44.982
Now that that's taken care of,

52:44.984 --> 52:47.746
let's pick it up where we left off.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.044
What happened to Angela?

52:49.046 --> 52:50.877
She knows more about what happened.

52:50.879 --> 52:53.075
She's not going to work out
for us, not on this level.

52:53.077 --> 52:55.831
We need to stick to the
more tech savvy here.

52:59.206 --> 53:01.335
Now, let's get to the heart of this thing

53:01.337 --> 53:03.467
because I can't sit here

53:03.469 --> 53:06.684
and look through a packet
for the next 20 minutes.

53:07.698 --> 53:11.278
All right, just who did
this? Is it that hard?

53:12.061 --> 53:17.531
- Who did this?
- I found the configuration file

53:17.532 --> 53:20.148
of the rootkit with a
pattern of IP addresses.

53:23.485 --> 53:28.013
Once you decrypt it, you'll
know where the hack came from.

53:40.143 --> 53:42.324
19 days.

53:45.905 --> 53:49.389
No news, no arrests, no revolution.

54:01.758 --> 54:05.820
No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

54:08.597 --> 54:11.905
_

54:20.409 --> 54:22.738
No Mr. Robot.

54:22.740 --> 54:24.804
No fsociety.

54:32.865 --> 54:35.928
I need to take my mind off things.

54:45.954 --> 54:48.570
- Hello.
- Hi, this is Sam

54:48.571 --> 54:51.015
from Bank of E security fraud department.

54:51.017 --> 54:52.913
Unfortunately I have to inform you

54:52.915 --> 54:54.712
that your account's been compromised.

54:55.714 --> 54:58.991
- What? What happened?
- First before I can answer any questions,

54:58.992 --> 55:00.587
I need to verify some information.

55:00.588 --> 55:05.022
- Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?
- Yes. Apartment 2C.

55:05.023 --> 55:07.192
- _
- Great. And your security question,

55:07.193 --> 55:10.593
- favorite baseball team?
- Um, Yankees.

55:10.594 --> 55:12.198
I don't remember this
being a security question.

55:12.199 --> 55:15.782
- And lastly, your pet's name?
- Um, Flipper.

55:15.783 --> 55:19.557
Who am I speaking to? Can
I get your name and number?

55:19.559 --> 55:21.889
With those details plus a
dictionary brute-force attack,

55:21.891 --> 55:26.085
it'll take my program maybe two
minutes to crack his password.

55:33.714 --> 55:36.909
What I wouldn't give to be normal.

55:36.911 --> 55:39.973
To live in that bubble,

55:39.975 --> 55:42.771
the reality of the naive.

55:46.237 --> 55:51.131
That's how I justify this.

55:51.133 --> 55:54.229
To keep their optimism intact.

55:54.231 --> 55:57.692
To protect them.

56:00.150 --> 56:01.439
_

56:01.440 --> 56:03.628
How? He's too old to have
a complicated password.

56:03.629 --> 56:06.552
It had to have been a
combination of these things.

56:10.151 --> 56:11.614
I'm missing something,
I'm missing something,

56:11.616 --> 56:16.044
I'm missing something.

56:16.046 --> 56:17.709
Michael Hansen isn't his real name.

56:26.970 --> 56:29.033
Come on. Get over here.

56:32.132 --> 56:33.562
Lenny Shannon?

56:33.564 --> 56:36.160
Michael Hansen?

56:36.162 --> 56:39.624
Which one are you playing tonight?

56:39.626 --> 56:42.143
- You're going to stop seeing Krista.
- What the f...

56:43.144 --> 56:45.433
You're going to break up with her.
You're never going to see her again.

56:46.752 --> 56:49.449
You're the guy that used my phone.

56:49.451 --> 56:51.880
You cheated on your current
wife with seven different women.

56:51.882 --> 56:53.882
I got digital proof of all of it.

56:53.883 --> 56:57.808
Ashley Madison, online
escorts, fake Facebook pages.

56:57.810 --> 56:59.973
I own it all.

56:59.975 --> 57:01.872
And if you don't stop seeing her,

57:01.874 --> 57:06.001
your wife will know everything
along with the police.

57:06.003 --> 57:09.226
- The police?
- Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

57:13.364 --> 57:14.636
That 15 part I made up,

57:14.637 --> 57:16.692
but he did have a
proclivity for young escorts

57:16.694 --> 57:18.024
that helped the lie.

57:18.026 --> 57:20.555
But I'm not gonna do any of that

57:20.557 --> 57:23.087
as long as you break up with Krista.

57:23.089 --> 57:25.152
Tonight.

57:29.183 --> 57:32.046
Done.

57:32.048 --> 57:34.211
You're also gonna tell her the truth.

57:34.213 --> 57:36.242
That you're married, cheat on your wife,

57:36.244 --> 57:38.507
you hire hookers.

57:38.509 --> 57:41.637
That you never had any intention
of being serious with her.

57:41.639 --> 57:43.070
Why?

57:43.072 --> 57:44.169
That would destroy her.

57:44.171 --> 57:46.500
She thinks that...

57:46.502 --> 57:48.466
We're in love.

57:48.468 --> 57:50.996
Exactly. Krista needs to
avoid dickheads like you

57:50.998 --> 57:52.162
in the future.

57:52.164 --> 57:54.726
Her radar needs fixing.

57:54.728 --> 57:57.658
I'll know if you skip any detail.

57:57.660 --> 58:01.821
So don't.

58:01.823 --> 58:04.785
And one more thing...

58:04.787 --> 58:07.715
I'm gonna need something from you.

58:11.581 --> 58:13.578
Come on.

58:24.503 --> 58:28.798
Hmm. I like you, Flipper.

58:28.800 --> 58:32.061
You're cool.

58:32.063 --> 58:34.161
I never want to be right about my hacks,

58:34.163 --> 58:36.925
but people always find a way to disappoint.

58:44.254 --> 58:47.916
Michael Hansen now gets
filed away among the others.

58:47.918 --> 58:50.281
Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

58:59.508 --> 59:01.504
The look of disillusionment.

59:01.506 --> 59:04.068
He told her. She cried all night.

59:04.070 --> 59:06.167
Now comes the sadness.

59:06.169 --> 59:08.595
I don't like seeing her sad.

59:12.130 --> 59:15.359
- You okay?
- Sorry.

59:15.361 --> 59:17.062
Sorry.

59:18.958 --> 59:22.154
Go on.

59:22.156 --> 59:24.452
I think Angela blames me for what happened

59:24.454 --> 59:26.916
at the Evil Corp meeting.

59:26.918 --> 59:29.248
What do I do? I need to talk to her.

59:29.250 --> 59:32.545
I think you just answered
your own question.

59:32.547 --> 59:34.144
Talk to her.

59:34.146 --> 59:36.772
She won't respond to any
of my texts or emails.

59:36.773 --> 59:38.873
Then go to her in person.

59:38.875 --> 59:42.037
Tell her you need to talk.

59:42.039 --> 59:45.401
Communication is key, Elliot.

59:45.403 --> 59:50.663
Real human interaction.

59:50.665 --> 59:53.360
That's what's important for you right now.

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:07.049
Hey. Do you...

01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:09.314
- Do you think we can talk?
- What?

01:00:09.316 --> 01:00:10.912
You won't talk to me.

01:00:10.914 --> 01:00:12.311
You haven't talked to me since the meeting.

01:00:12.313 --> 01:00:13.809
I don't want to talk to you

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:17.173
because I feel embarrassed

01:00:17.175 --> 01:00:19.271
every time I think about what happened.

01:00:19.273 --> 01:00:21.137
Okay?

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:24.167
It's fine. I'll get over it.

01:00:24.169 --> 01:00:26.102
- It's been three weeks.
- I have to get back to work.

01:00:26.103 --> 01:00:28.859
- You're just going to ignore me?
- You didn't have to stick up for me in there.

01:00:29.832 --> 01:00:31.261
I know that you were just trying to help,

01:00:31.263 --> 01:00:34.892
just don't do it again.

01:00:34.894 --> 01:00:36.724
Even if I'm losing.

01:00:36.726 --> 01:00:39.591
Let me lose, okay?

01:00:41.222 --> 01:00:43.784
Don't look confused.

01:00:43.786 --> 01:00:46.915
Just say it.

01:00:46.917 --> 01:00:49.166
"Okay."

01:00:51.846 --> 01:00:53.872
Okay.

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:10.861
Elliott.

01:01:28.248 --> 01:01:32.010
FBI agents claim that Colby
either used hacking groups

01:01:32.011 --> 01:01:33.927
or worked in conjunction with them

01:01:33.928 --> 01:01:37.273
to pressure Evil Corp during
his contract negotiations.

01:01:37.275 --> 01:01:40.103
After a long and exhaustive investigation,

01:01:40.105 --> 01:01:44.334
sources close to the FBI
have confirmed the hacks were

01:01:44.336 --> 01:01:47.930
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

01:01:51.263 --> 01:01:54.725
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.449
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

01:02:22.404 --> 01:02:26.465
Sir, step inside the car.

01:02:30.097 --> 01:02:31.694
Sir.

01:02:35.526 --> 01:02:37.922
Step inside the vehicle now.

01:03:09.231 --> 01:03:11.327
Go ahead.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.392
Sir, go on in.

01:03:17.091 --> 01:03:19.153
Sir, go on in.

01:04:12.212 --> 01:04:15.106
Bonsoir, Elliot.

01:04:16.941 --> 01:04:19.237
Please tell me you're seeing this, too.
