00:05.171 --> 00:06.213
Hello?

00:06.381 --> 00:08.382
- Hey, Joey!
- Hey, Pheebs.

00:08.591 --> 00:09.842
Can you do me a favor?

00:10.051 --> 00:13.429
I forgot the PIN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?

00:13.638 --> 00:14.680
Sure. Where is it?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.933
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine
on the corner.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.894
Oh, so you're 5-6-3-9?

00:21.104 --> 00:22.771
That's it! Thanks.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.817
- Wanna talk to Chandler?
- Let me talk to him.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.819
He didn't believe in my movie...

00:29.029 --> 00:33.240
...which is a big mistake,
because it is real. Real.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.617
I've tried to apologize.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.413
If I can't do it on the phone,
I'll go and do it in person.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.665
I heard that. Uh, can you put him on?

00:41.833 --> 00:42.875
Yeah.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.378
- Hey.
- Don't come out here.

00:48.506 --> 00:51.925
I support you 100 percent
and I wanna prove that to you in person.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.387
I got that. I forgive you.
Don't come out here.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.765
You haven't taken
my calls for a week.

00:57.974 --> 01:01.810
I'm totally over it. Friends forever.
Don't come out here.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.480
Would you mind doing
a picture with us?

01:06.316 --> 01:07.357
Uh, what was that?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.359
Uh, Entertainment Tonight.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.490
Good talking to you
and don't come out here.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.031
Monica?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.742
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.205
Monica?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.332
Phoebe?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.377
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?

02:09.586 --> 02:11.255
That's okay.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.049
What the hell took you so long?

02:16.219 --> 02:18.887
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.556
- Which Richard?
- The Richard.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.933
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!

02:24.227 --> 02:28.522
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.

02:28.731 --> 02:32.109
Okay, that actually makes more sense.
How was it?

02:32.318 --> 02:36.113
It was really nice. We talked
and I had lunch with him.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.449
That's weird. I dreamed
you had lunch with Richard.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.577
- Really?
- Again, Richard Simmons.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.370
Go on.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.081
The strange part was
he was really nice...

02:46.291 --> 02:49.209
...and he looks great,
but I didn't feel anything.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.253
So why can't we tell Chandler?

02:51.462 --> 02:56.049
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our
anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.344
I can't believe you guys
have lasted a whole year!

02:59.554 --> 03:01.847
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.

03:02.891 --> 03:03.932
What?

03:04.142 --> 03:05.934
On a totally different bet.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.313
Hey!

03:09.480 --> 03:11.940
- It's almost our anniversary!
- I know.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.235
One year ago today, I was just
your annoying friend Chandler.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.906
Aw, now you're just
my annoying friend Chandler.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.575
- Huh.
- I got you a gift.

03:21.784 --> 03:25.579
- It's not till tomorrow.
- I know, but you have to open it today.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.427
Okay! There you go!

03:40.678 --> 03:43.347
- It's two tickets to Vegas!
- Wow.

03:43.514 --> 03:46.475
Yeah! For this weekend!
It'll be perfect.

03:46.684 --> 03:50.812
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start
our celebration on the plane.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.107
We can call it our "Plane-a-versary."

03:55.193 --> 03:56.235
We have to?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.657
This is great, but Joey didn't want
any of us there.

04:01.866 --> 04:06.578
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.

04:06.829 --> 04:10.666
Plus, we get to have
our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!

04:12.710 --> 04:15.295
"Anna-vada-versary!"

04:16.130 --> 04:18.757
I think we should see other people.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.300
We can go, right?

04:20.593 --> 04:21.802
Great idea.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.303
I'm gonna go too!

04:26.474 --> 04:28.600
Pheebs, it's kind of
our anniversary.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.561
You won't ditch me
like you did with London.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.605
Ditch you?
You were pregnant...

04:33.773 --> 04:35.357
Uh-huh. Great story. I'm going.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.195
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.658
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go
to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!

04:46.619 --> 04:48.161
Including me!

04:48.830 --> 04:49.871
Do you wanna go?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.999
I can take a couple days off work.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.628
Of course you can take a couple days
off, because this trip includes me!

04:58.464 --> 05:01.717
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.

05:01.926 --> 05:05.971
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh
exhibit. I waited a year for this.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.100
- Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
- Sounds great.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.768
I'll call the airlines.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.605
That'll be nice to have
the apartment to myself.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.774
To walk around naked.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.739
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.615
Naked alone time.

05:26.492 --> 05:30.078
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean
I wanna walk around naked.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.706
You live alone,
you don't walk around naked.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.834
Uh-huh. Why does it takes me so long
to answer the door?

05:42.467 --> 05:47.137
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas
better or worse than the trip to London?

05:47.388 --> 05:50.015
So far, it's pretty much
the same, Pheebs.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.977
What about after I give you
these candies?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.689
- I guess it's a little better now.
- Ha, ha.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.902
Las Vegas, 1. London, 0.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.570
I'll be back.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.950
Happy Plane-a-versary.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.162
Aw. I love you.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.248
- Can I give you your present now?
- Okay!

06:19.879 --> 06:21.838
Oh, don't tell me I did this.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.467
I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!

06:26.177 --> 06:29.888
How about "I did forget the present,
forgive me" not fake-out?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.891
You can give it to me
when we get back.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.519
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.647
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.194
What "Richard thing"?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.279
Oh, no.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.116
What "Richard thing"?

06:49.325 --> 06:51.118
Simmons. Go with Simmons.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.252
I ran into Richard yesterday.

07:00.461 --> 07:04.172
He asked me if I wanted to go
for a bite and I did.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.967
I didn't tell you
because you'd get mad...

07:07.176 --> 07:09.678
...and I didn't wanna spoil
our anniversary.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.763
I'm not mad.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.808
Really?

07:16.185 --> 07:19.271
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite."

07:21.858 --> 07:23.442
No big deal.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.946
Great.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.077
Okay, London, 1.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.252
Ooh.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.016
Hmm.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.566
Oh, look what happened.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.820
Huh, check me out.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.364
I'm in my kitchen...

08:11.616 --> 08:13.116
...naked.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.453
I'm picking up an orange.

08:16.954 --> 08:17.996
I'm naked.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.335
I'm lighting the candles.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.338
Naked. And carefully.

08:37.308 --> 08:40.227
Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!

08:42.395 --> 08:45.023
I can't look at that.
I am looking at this.

08:45.233 --> 08:49.194
Okay, vivid colors,
expressive brush strokes.

08:50.321 --> 08:54.199
Unless she wants me
to be looking at that.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.618
She knows I'm home.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.746
She knows I can see her.

08:59.997 --> 09:03.583
What kind of game is she playing?

09:03.834 --> 09:07.796
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.257
Oh, Dr. Geller.

09:10.508 --> 09:15.178
Stop it. You're being silly. Ha, ha.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.138
Or am I?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.893
Love to love you baby

09:22.061 --> 09:23.603
Ow

09:24.397 --> 09:27.023
Love to love you baby
Ow

09:34.323 --> 09:37.117
Love to love you baby
Ow

09:38.494 --> 09:39.828
Darn it!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.463
Hey.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.095
May I come in?

09:58.139 --> 09:59.806
Uh, yeah, if you want to.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.726
Do you want me to?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.645
Yeah, sure?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.689
So do I.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.822
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...

10:16.073 --> 10:18.783
...I wanna lay down a couple
of ground rules.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.661
This is just about tonight.

10:21.954 --> 10:26.082
I won't go through with this
if it'll raise the question of "us."

10:28.210 --> 10:29.628
I just want this to be...

10:32.757 --> 10:34.758
...about what it is.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.138
And, um...

10:40.389 --> 10:42.182
...what is that, Ross?

10:42.391 --> 10:45.018
The physical act of love.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.979
What, are you crazy?

10:48.189 --> 10:53.109
So you weren't trying to entice me
just now with your nakedness?

10:55.946 --> 10:58.406
Oh, God. You saw me?

11:02.119 --> 11:06.289
You weren't trying to entice me
with your nakedness?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.540
No!

11:07.792 --> 11:11.920
You actually thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.050
No!

11:18.886 --> 11:21.805
No.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.184
No, no, no, no.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.710
Hey, you guys, wait! You guys.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.212
This place is much better than London.

11:54.463 --> 11:57.090
A lady dressed like Cleopatra
gave me this.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.926
Ninety-nine cent
steak and lobster dinner. Huh.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.469
You don't eat animals.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.972
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.600
I can totally settle down here.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.980
It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey! Look!

12:13.107 --> 12:14.232
Look! Hey!

12:14.692 --> 12:15.775
Oh, my God.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.819
Hey, Joey!

12:21.365 --> 12:22.615
- Wow!
- Hi.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.367
Love your condoms, my man.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.163
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.373
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?

12:30.541 --> 12:35.211
Uh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.340
Hold on a second. Can we cut?

12:39.592 --> 12:42.093
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.220
Who are you talking to?

12:45.514 --> 12:46.598
The director.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.475
Uh, her.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.731
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
I work here.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.399
Why? What happened?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.735
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.238
I'm working here till it starts up,
if it ever does.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.157
- I'm so sorry.
- Such a drag.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.618
Sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.996
Apparently there's
a new policy of not sharing.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.708
- I knew you weren't okay with that.
- So you're a gladiator!

13:14.627 --> 13:16.085
What's going on?

13:16.295 --> 13:19.172
- Monica had lunch with Richard.
- Dawson?

13:20.549 --> 13:21.591
No...

13:21.801 --> 13:24.260
But that would've been so cool!

13:24.720 --> 13:26.095
Her boyfriend Richard.

13:26.305 --> 13:30.600
It meant nothing. After all this time,
how can you not trust me?

13:30.810 --> 13:34.270
When you go lunching with hunky men
and don't tell me!

13:36.440 --> 13:39.275
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.902
Thanks.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.614
- Aw, there we go.
- Now I love Vegas.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.785
I promise you next time
I absolutely will tell you.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.248
"Next time"?

13:53.707 --> 13:55.208
Ooh, so close.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.254
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.

13:59.463 --> 14:03.091
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.301
That's funny, I think I just did.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.055
If you act like this,
I won't be around you.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.932
- Fine.
- Happy anniversary!

14:11.141 --> 14:13.560
Guys, please! Come on, come on.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.895
This is obviously
a misunderstanding.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.106
- No, it's not.
- What're you talking about?

14:18.315 --> 14:20.108
Don't look at me. I just work here.

14:24.321 --> 14:28.992
Okay, um, Ross? I'm a little warm,
so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.786
Now, I'm just letting you know...

14:32.037 --> 14:36.124
...this is not an invitation
to the physical act of love.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.086
Yep, that's hilarious.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.922
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.259
You know, last night was
embarrassing for you too.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.386
No, not really.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.389
But you know,
I just don't embarrass that easily.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.725
What? You totally get embarrassed.

14:53.934 --> 14:58.521
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just
a more secure person than you are.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.398
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.443
Hey, lady!

15:03.652 --> 15:06.029
I don't care how much
you want it, okay?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.240
I am not gonna have sex
with you in the bathroom!

15:14.538 --> 15:17.832
You know, in Roman times,
this was more than just a hat.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.667
Really?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.169
Yeah, sure, sure.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.421
They would scrub the floors.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.215
They'd use it to get the mud
off their shoe.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.260
Sometimes underneath
the horse would get dirty.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.262
So they would stick it right...

15:32.139 --> 15:35.183
I can't believe this is how
I'm spending my anniversary.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.770
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $100.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.021
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

15:40.230 --> 15:43.483
He was playing blackjack
for an hour and he won $5000.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.401
Can you believe that?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.820
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.489
Build up my upper body...

15:49.698 --> 15:52.200
...and hit Richard from behind
with a stick.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.287
Wait! Why don't I just
do what that guy did?

15:56.538 --> 15:58.706
I'll take this $100,
turn it into $5000...

15:58.958 --> 16:02.210
...and I'll turn that into enough
to get my movie going!

16:03.212 --> 16:04.504
Good luck.

16:04.713 --> 16:08.216
- I don't need luck. I've thought this through.
- I see.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.098
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.102
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.730
You had a minor setback
in your relationship.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.649
Big deal. It's only Chandler.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.195
I am so sorry.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.200
This is crazy having
such a stupid argument.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.160
I don't wanna see Richard.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.329
So go fix it.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.249
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.376
Tell him sorry and you love him.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.670
You're right, Phoebe.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.338
- Thank you.
- Sure.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.884
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!

17:01.645 --> 17:04.063
- Anybody lose this?
- Coming out.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.522
Place your bet.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.067
Dice her out.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.405
Yellow 11. Pay the front line!

17:16.743 --> 17:18.368
Hmm.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.666
So, uh, I'm on my way
back to the bathroom.

17:27.628 --> 17:30.923
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?

17:40.642 --> 17:42.477
What are you... I am sorry, sir.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.688
I think he just really likes you.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.194
Hey...

17:51.403 --> 17:55.073
You know that teacher who had a baby
with her student?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.086
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

18:08.295 --> 18:13.132
Do you have any extra pants? Uh, my friend
seems to have had a little accident.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.474
- Can I change 100?
- Changing 100.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.811
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.022
That's right.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.071
- Thirteen.
- Hit me!

18:36.532 --> 18:38.533
Oh, man!

18:41.328 --> 18:42.495
Wait!

18:44.706 --> 18:46.791
You are not gonna believe this!

18:47.000 --> 18:49.752
I have found my identical hand twin.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.049
What?

18:55.926 --> 18:57.760
My identical hand twin!

18:59.638 --> 19:01.305
What's an identical hand twin?

19:01.515 --> 19:05.184
It was incredible. The dealer's hands
were exactly like mine.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.854
It was like looking
at my hands in a mirror!

19:09.439 --> 19:12.400
You sure you weren't
looking at your hands in a mirror?

19:13.402 --> 19:17.280
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.073
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

19:21.326 --> 19:22.368
How?

19:22.578 --> 19:24.912
I don't have it all worked out yet.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.791
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!

19:30.419 --> 19:32.420
Again, I must go back to...

19:32.671 --> 19:34.088
...how?

19:35.424 --> 19:39.177
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!

19:41.096 --> 19:43.681
How much would you pay
to see this hand...

19:43.932 --> 19:46.184
...twice? Huh?

19:49.396 --> 19:51.981
I can't really put a price on that.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.859
Are you un-supporting me again?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.402
No. No.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.281
I support you 100 percent.
I just didn't get it right away.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.949
Now I'm caught up.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.035
Identical hand twins.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.703
It's a million-dollar idea!

20:11.418 --> 20:12.501
- Hey!
- Pheebs!

20:12.711 --> 20:14.587
I found my identical hand twin!

20:14.796 --> 20:17.006
Oh, you're so lucky!

20:21.637 --> 20:24.472
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?

20:24.681 --> 20:27.600
- No.
- But she just came up here.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.518
That was Joey.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.271
I wonder where she is? It's so weird.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.357
She's probably talking to Richard.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.234
Would you stop that?

20:36.902 --> 20:40.154
You know what she said
after her lunch with Richard?

20:40.405 --> 20:43.241
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.285
- Really?
- Yes.

20:46.495 --> 20:50.873
She feels terrible. She really wants
to make up. You've gotta find her.

20:52.793 --> 20:53.834
Okay.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.586
Good.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.971
I should really start wearing hats.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.476
Welcome to Las Vegas.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.771
- Did you enjoy your flight?
- I did.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.524
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.738
- I hope you had a nice flight.
- Oh, it was the best.
