15:52.052 --> 15:54.353
You can't just let Scully
go wherever he wants.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.822
We lost track of who was where, sorry.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.325
Guys, if we're gonna pull
this off, we need to focus.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.826
- You want to play?
- Yeah, I want to play.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.094
It's quarters. What, am I a monster?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.363
Terry, tag me in. You're
on Holt party duty.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.366
It seems to me all-wheel drive

16:07.400 --> 16:09.868
is four-wheel drive.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.271
[Techno music]

16:12.305 --> 16:13.906
You need something. Who needs something?

16:13.940 --> 16:15.441
I know they say it's not good

16:15.475 --> 16:16.875
to have a TV in the bedroom,

16:16.910 --> 16:19.311
which is...

16:19.346 --> 16:20.446
why I don't.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.681
[All cheering]

16:22.716 --> 16:24.216
[Laughing]

16:24.250 --> 16:26.018
I am the king of quarters!

16:26.052 --> 16:27.653
[All laughing]

16:27.687 --> 16:30.522
See, I told you guys we'd
still have fun this weekend.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.825
Wait, Terry, aren't you
supposed to be upstairs?

16:32.859 --> 16:35.694
Not now. It's schnapps time.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.463
Okay, Amy and Hitchcock are still upstairs.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.464
I think we're still good.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.967
Six-drink Amy...

16:42.002 --> 16:44.503
is so alone.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.739
Oh, no.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.240
Six-drink Amy isn't fun.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.075
She's just sad. Damn it.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.944
<i>(Jake) Guys, this is really bad.</i>

16:51.978 --> 16:53.245
Got to get up there.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.480
Now, where is everyone?

16:54.514 --> 16:57.316
Ah, Detectives.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.019
You were having a party without me.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.187
- Captain...
- No need to explain.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.559
This is gonna sound controversial,

17:07.594 --> 17:09.728
but I think that went pretty good.

17:11.825 --> 17:12.892
Man, I've never seen Captain
Holt that upset before.

17:12.925 --> 17:14.993
He looks like a sad block of granite.

17:15.029 --> 17:16.128
What are we gonna do?

17:16.163 --> 17:18.097
How do you cheer up granite?

17:18.132 --> 17:19.632
Well, you could salvage it,

17:19.665 --> 17:21.334
much like the casino we've been talk...

17:21.367 --> 17:23.368
<i>- Seriously, stop.
- (Terry) I feel awful.</i>

17:23.404 --> 17:26.172
My fanny's not deep enough to fix this.

17:26.205 --> 17:29.175
Vacation Terry...

17:29.209 --> 17:31.010
- is dead.
- [Whispers] The fanny.

17:31.045 --> 17:32.345
I'm gonna go talk to Captain Holt.

17:32.379 --> 17:33.846
No, don't do that.

17:33.881 --> 17:34.981
I invited him up here.

17:35.015 --> 17:36.516
I should go talk to him.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.284
- Okay.
- What?

17:38.318 --> 17:39.752
Really thought you were
gonna fight me on that,

17:39.787 --> 17:41.087
and then we'd have a
whole back-and-forth,

17:41.121 --> 17:43.222
and eventually you'd go,
"Jake, I respect you",

17:43.257 --> 17:44.457
but I got to do this."

17:44.591 --> 17:45.992
No, it's uncomfortable.

17:46.026 --> 17:47.260
I'd much rather you do it.

17:47.294 --> 17:49.262
All right, fine.

17:49.296 --> 17:51.297
Here I go.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.568
- You're walking in place.
- All right!

17:55.692 --> 17:57.460
Hey, I need to write Marcus back fast.

17:57.494 --> 17:58.961
He's already freaked out
by how long it takes me

17:58.996 --> 18:00.329
to text him back.

18:00.364 --> 18:03.132
Listen, Rosa, there's nothing
I'd rather do in my life

18:03.166 --> 18:05.234
than write a sexy text to your boyfriend,

18:05.269 --> 18:07.036
but I think this is something
you got to do on your own.

18:07.070 --> 18:08.437
Why?

18:08.472 --> 18:09.772
You're so good at being lame, and I'm not.

18:09.806 --> 18:11.240
- Yeah.
- Look, I like him.

18:11.275 --> 18:12.408
I really like him.

18:12.442 --> 18:13.743
I don't want to screw this crap up.

18:13.777 --> 18:15.144
That's what you should say.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.747
Just take that sentiment,
remove the word "crap,"

18:17.781 --> 18:19.715
and then send it.

18:22.319 --> 18:23.519
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:23.554 --> 18:24.687
Gah, I sent it.

18:24.721 --> 18:25.922
He didn't write back, so he hates it.

18:25.956 --> 18:27.723
No, wait. Look.

18:27.758 --> 18:31.093
Okay, oh, okay, "dot, dot, dot."

18:31.128 --> 18:32.161
- It's happening.
- [Cell phone chimes]

18:32.195 --> 18:34.063
It's a shirtless pic.

18:34.097 --> 18:37.200
We did it. We did it!

18:37.234 --> 18:38.434
Thanks, Boyle.

18:38.468 --> 18:40.436
Okay, I'm gonna leave. Don't follow me.

18:40.470 --> 18:41.537
Things are about to get intense.

18:41.572 --> 18:42.772
Makes sense.

18:44.708 --> 18:45.942
<i>(Gina) Ames.</i>

18:45.976 --> 18:47.877
Gina.

18:47.911 --> 18:50.213
You got to see the sasquatch.

18:50.247 --> 18:51.747
Was it everything you drumpt?

18:51.782 --> 18:54.784
It was the stuff drumps are made of.

18:54.818 --> 18:57.787
Can you hold my eyes still
till things stop spinning?

18:57.821 --> 18:58.921
Okay, let's sit you up.

18:58.956 --> 19:00.156
There. Easy does...

19:00.190 --> 19:02.558
there... oh, there you go.

19:02.593 --> 19:04.427
Now drink this entire glass of water.

19:04.661 --> 19:07.396
You're taking care of me.

19:07.431 --> 19:09.265
Just cause I know you won't remember it.

19:09.299 --> 19:12.435
Mm-mm, no.

19:12.469 --> 19:13.636
You like me.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.873
Six-drink Amy is your friend.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.175
[Gags]

19:19.209 --> 19:22.278
And... and she's gonna
be very sick right now.

19:22.312 --> 19:23.312
Okay.

19:23.347 --> 19:24.914
[Grunts]

19:27.017 --> 19:28.885
I heard you were out here.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.286
Really hate those jets, huh?

19:30.320 --> 19:32.488
I'm not a child. I
don't need a bubble bath.

19:35.359 --> 19:36.559
So listen.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.494
Before you say anything,
I want to say I'm sorry.

19:38.529 --> 19:40.296
You're sorry?

19:40.330 --> 19:42.632
Wow, I can't believe I
almost made Terry do this.

19:42.666 --> 19:43.900
Apology accepted.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.134
I was so eager to make up

19:45.168 --> 19:46.836
for all the joshing around I'd missed,

19:46.870 --> 19:49.338
I forgot this getaway is
really for you detectives.

19:49.373 --> 19:52.275
And one of the things you're
striving to get away from

19:52.309 --> 19:53.543
is your captain.

19:53.577 --> 19:57.079
Yeah, I mean, it's nothing
against you as a person.

19:57.114 --> 19:58.347
Everyone loves you,

19:58.382 --> 20:00.116
but you're our captain,

20:00.150 --> 20:02.418
and normally we get really drunk

20:02.452 --> 20:04.687
and act like crazy idiots
and play stupid games

20:04.721 --> 20:06.622
where we make fun of the boss.

20:06.657 --> 20:09.792
Which is hard when the boss is present.

20:09.826 --> 20:10.893
Yeah.

20:10.928 --> 20:13.262
[Surf crashing in distance]

20:13.297 --> 20:14.830
But not impossible.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.433
I think instead of us rising to your level,

20:17.467 --> 20:20.303
it's maybe time for you
to stoop down to ours.

20:20.337 --> 20:22.738
[Chuckles]

20:27.377 --> 20:30.880
And that's just the start.

20:30.914 --> 20:33.916
I call the game "Real Ray or Fake Ray?"

20:33.951 --> 20:36.219
And joining us is a
very special contestant,

20:36.253 --> 20:37.853
Captain Ray Holt himself.

20:37.888 --> 20:41.224
[Cheers and applause]

20:41.258 --> 20:43.326
<i>(Jake) All right, here's
how the game works.</i>

20:43.360 --> 20:44.427
I will say a phrase.

20:44.461 --> 20:45.695
You tell me if I made it up

20:45.729 --> 20:47.496
or if it's something that Captain Holt

20:47.531 --> 20:50.666
actually said in real life
to an actual human being.

20:50.701 --> 20:52.168
I understand the logic of this game.

20:52.202 --> 20:54.704
Great! Phrase number one:

20:54.738 --> 20:57.106
"The futility of lighting candles

20:57.140 --> 20:58.641
only to blow them out immediately

20:58.675 --> 21:02.011
is just one reason I find
children's birthday parties

21:02.045 --> 21:03.312
impractical."

21:03.347 --> 21:04.313
<i>- Holt.
- That's Holt.</i>

21:04.348 --> 21:05.314
Mm, fake.

21:05.349 --> 21:06.649
I say fake too.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.251
I don't remember saying
it, so it must be fake.

21:08.285 --> 21:09.252
It was real!

21:09.286 --> 21:10.319
(All) Oh!

21:10.354 --> 21:12.622
To Terry's kids at their birthday party.

21:12.656 --> 21:13.723
Oh, I remember now.

21:13.757 --> 21:14.957
Oh, do another one. Do another one.

21:14.992 --> 21:16.459
<i>All right, phrase number two:</i>

21:16.493 --> 21:19.762
"Any smile that lasts longer
than a second and a half

21:19.796 --> 21:22.331
is a con man's ruse."

21:22.366 --> 21:24.066
That's fake. That's a fake one.

21:24.101 --> 21:25.434
I said it.

21:25.469 --> 21:26.903
And I meant it!

21:26.937 --> 21:28.437
(All) Oh!

21:30.440 --> 21:32.375
(Man) Not a doctor. Shh.
