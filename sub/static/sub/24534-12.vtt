00:02.750 --> 00:05.537
- She enjoyed a Black Jack.
- Card player?

00:06.210 --> 00:07.996
Taﬁjc Licorice.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.911
Sort of an acquired taste; I suppose.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.542
- I never much cared for them before.
- And now?

00:19.390 --> 00:20.596
I don ’t mino’ them.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.518
You mmk yo'u 7/ find her?
- I know I mil.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.657
I never should have left you
at that bus, John.

01:23.580 --> 01:26.242
I saw the tape you made
when you first met AI.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.957
She asked if you thought
you would find me again.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.370
And you knew.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.137
You believed.

01:41.140 --> 01:44.803
But if she asked me that question.
Right now.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.141
Today.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.981
I don't think I could have
answered like you did.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.650
You know me, John.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.206
Or at least I think you do.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.785
When the going gets tough, I run...

02:14.260 --> 02:15.704
Or worse.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.470
Things are pretty tough right now.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.180
How did you know?

02:37.440 --> 02:39.021
How did you believe?

02:50.880 --> 02:52.450
Trying to raise John again?

02:59.550 --> 03:00.790
No diesel.

03:01.930 --> 03:04.171
Start conserving the battery
on that thing.

03:05.220 --> 03:07.017
We can't recharge.

03:45.180 --> 03:47.637
- She enjoyed a Black Jack.
- Card player?

03:48.430 --> 03:49.920
Taﬁjc Licorice.

04:21.090 --> 04:22.717
We're out of water, Al.

04:24.930 --> 04:28.218
We can't keep going out just far enough to
make it back before sundown.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.391
We're gonna have to walk away.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.101
And keep going.

04:46.570 --> 04:48.071
John? Is that you?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.876
JohnlJohn!

05:40.960 --> 05:43.667
- Hah! That was a clean hit.
- Clean as a cow's ass.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.966
Yeah, you'd know, bro.

05:47.090 --> 05:48.717
Well, shit.

05:54.390 --> 05:56.096
Catching a skin muncher like that?

05:57.100 --> 06:02.106
Hey, you remember when Dad hit that
seagull and it got stuck on the hood?

06:02.690 --> 06:05.181
I mean, that's gotta be, what?
One in a million?

06:05.280 --> 06:06.941
- I told you.
- Yeah.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.697
- I still get the point.
- A half.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.736
I heard that.

06:16.660 --> 06:19.879
Come... There you go.

06:23.500 --> 06:27.618
Anybody copy? This is Morgan.
Does anybody copy?

06:32.890 --> 06:38.226
If you can hear me, I'm at
mile marker 27 on Highway 365,

06:38.310 --> 06:39.800
and we're heading west.

06:40.350 --> 06:41.726
Guys, I got help.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.605
Let's go.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.566
Where? We didn't even
hear what that person said.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.980
It's got better range at higher ground.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.243
We find that, we get back on.
See if we get the signal again.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.457
Smart. Okay.

07:02.290 --> 07:03.587
Did you kill the camera?

07:08.050 --> 07:09.256
I killed the battery.

07:12.430 --> 07:14.045
Watching that tape?

07:16.140 --> 07:17.516
Watching that tape.

07:29.190 --> 07:30.521
You okay?

07:31.450 --> 07:32.769
Yeah.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.232
Yeah, I just... Low blood sugar
equals low blood pressure.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.289
- And I'm shaky.
- You go. I'll stay.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.549
- You got a handful of brow sweat now.
- I've had handfuls of worse.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.506
You're a little warm.

07:49.590 --> 07:51.376
It'd be good for you to get out there.
Get some fresh air.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.545
You should come with me.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.426
I'll make sure the van's safe.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.929
Al, whoever's on the other end of this
might have food, water, fuel.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.517
You bring your blood sugar up
as soon as we find something.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.819
We come back here, get the van going,
and find everyone else.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.771
If we keep stopping like this,
we're never gonna get to Virginia.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.657
Well, yeah. We won't.
We'll definitely get killed by something.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.400
Aanay, pass me a beer, Jimbo.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.828
I'm gonna leave this channel open.
And I will be listening.

08:30.460 --> 08:32.416
You really think your people
are gonna hear ya?

08:35.470 --> 08:36.755
I gotta try.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.551
Somebody did the same for me once.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.845
For as long as he could.

08:45.480 --> 08:46.686
Did it work?

08:52.440 --> 08:53.850
It didn't work.

08:53.990 --> 08:55.400
It'll work.

09:00.450 --> 09:06.036
I repeat. Highway 365,
mile 27, heading west.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.925
Nothing, huh?

09:23.350 --> 09:24.590
Not yet.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.931
Dizzy? Your vision okay?

09:33.780 --> 09:35.395
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.191
Been too good at keeping my belly full.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.481
It's been a while
since it's been like this.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.870
We might be done walking.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.477
Open it up.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.690
Can anyone hear me?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.618
I repeat. Can anyone hear me?

10:25.950 --> 10:27.781
So let's find some higher ground.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.211
I'm sorry I used up all the battery
on your camera.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.887
Hey, I get it.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.017
Can't talk to him.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.346
It's the next best thing.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.435
You ever have someone?

11:03.620 --> 11:05.986
Been doing what I do since before
the world went to shit.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.959
When you spend as much time as I did
collecting other people's stories,

11:13.210 --> 11:15.121
kinda stop having your own.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.716
Can anyone hear me?

11:25.100 --> 11:27.091
I repeat Can anyone hear me?

11:34.060 --> 11:37.939
You made them weak, Purvis.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.031
Time to hit the road, Mo-mo.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.451
Please don't call me that.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.417
- I got to keep doing it.
- Really? Why?

11:52.750 --> 11:54.069
I really like it.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.660
Can anyone... Me?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.370
Hello?

12:02.010 --> 12:03.580
Hello, is there anybody there?

12:04.890 --> 12:06.209
Can you hear me?

12:12.690 --> 12:14.226
So, there's a change of plans.

12:14.310 --> 12:15.800
I'm gonna take a stroll.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.515
See if I can get a stronger signal.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.219
What are we supposed to do?

12:20.110 --> 12:21.350
Supposed to wait.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.445
This dude...

12:24.780 --> 12:27.863
Well, crack that grisette, Jimbo.

12:29.700 --> 12:33.284
Yeah. Looks like we're tailgating.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.291
Whoever this is...

12:42.970 --> 12:46.007
I hear you. You just hold on.

12:49.220 --> 12:51.472
Go again. I repeat. Go again.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.187
We should keep driving.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.219
Al.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.610
It might not be my blood sugar.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.077
- Burning up.
- No, I'm good.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.819
It's a bug. It's fine.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.797
My van.

13:25.010 --> 13:26.671
What the hell?

13:31.640 --> 13:33.346
- We don't even know who took it.
- Doesn't matter.

13:33.430 --> 13:35.136
We're stopping that son of a bitch.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.521
- Al, slow down.
- We've almost got him.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.330
Al!

14:13.270 --> 14:17.309
Al, you are sick.
It could be cholera, dengue fever...

14:17.390 --> 14:18.391
- Are you kidding me?
- Malaria.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.344
I'm getting my van back.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.817
Screw the van, Al!
You need medicine! Antibiotics.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.186
I have it. Cipro. Amoxicillin.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.895
- Where?
- Where do you think?

14:27.490 --> 14:28.775
In the van.

14:30.410 --> 14:31.900
We have to get it back.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.710
It's okay.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.840
What's written there is the truth.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.261
You can take what you need.

15:10.030 --> 15:13.238
Things are tough out here, I know.

15:15.660 --> 15:17.537
That box, what's in there...

15:20.790 --> 15:22.121
You know, it helped me.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.876
It could help you, too.

15:33.720 --> 15:37.053
I don't need any help.

15:38.430 --> 15:39.761
I'm not weak.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.186
No, I didn't say you were.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.736
Hey, I'm just gonna continue on my way.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.072
But like it says there,
you take what you need.

16:20.350 --> 16:21.760
You're right.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.641
Things are tough out here.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.028
You should be careful.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.656
Hey, Al, talk to me.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.769
About what?

17:19.870 --> 17:23.192
I just want you to keep talking, okay?
I want you to stay with me.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.280
Okay.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.334
Tell me about the van.
Where'd you get It?

17:33.420 --> 17:36.127
I don't really feel like
getting into that right now.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.757
Haven't seen many reporters
with hardware like that.

17:42.310 --> 17:44.426
How many reporters did you know?

17:46.810 --> 17:48.346
None.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.140
Look at you.

17:53.110 --> 17:54.930
Turning the questions around on me.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.610
Those are my guns.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.587
It's close. You could go on foot.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.489
This won't take much longer, okay?

18:12.590 --> 18:15.161
- No, the van might not still be there.
- I can't leave you alone.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.330
- Yes. You can.
- No.

18:19.590 --> 18:21.638
Look, I know it hasn't worked out for you

18:21.720 --> 18:23.927
when you leave people behind,
but you can do this.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.098
It's the only way I'm gonna get
the meds I need.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.141
June?

18:31.230 --> 18:32.561
June.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.651
Come on.

18:46.540 --> 18:49.452
You take the long range.
I don't come back...

18:50.630 --> 18:53.087
You get in touch with those people
we heard on there.

18:59.090 --> 19:00.296
You got this.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.710
I'll radio when I'm on my way back.

20:26.430 --> 20:27.886
I said drop it.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.317
I just need some medicine--

20:38.400 --> 20:39.719
Hands behind your head.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.195
Move.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.910
You don't have to do this.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.977
Where's your friend?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.976
You must need the medicine for someone.

21:20.820 --> 21:23.948
Please. I just need the medicine.

21:24.490 --> 21:26.697
- It's on the van.
- This isn't a conversation.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.941
What you're doing right now...

21:32.290 --> 21:33.780
I've been there.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.702
But someone showed me that
I didn't have to live like that.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.990
And neither do you.

21:41.090 --> 21:43.046
- Everybody's gotta live like that.
- No.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.966
We can work together.

21:49.390 --> 21:51.756
We can help each other.

21:51.850 --> 21:54.671
No, we can't. We're all the same.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.392
Doing things to protect the
people we care about.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.358
People we know. People we love.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.641
That's where it stops, right?

22:09.700 --> 22:11.656
- I can't let my friend die.
- Exactly.

22:12.410 --> 22:14.037
I come with you,

22:14.450 --> 22:16.532
I'm just the guy you
talked out of shooting you.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.070
I'm the first to go when things go south.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.484
Stop!

22:56.370 --> 22:57.246
No!

23:24.230 --> 23:27.734
It died. Ran out of gas.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.487
I was hoping there
would be diesel on the bus.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.577
There's not!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.206
Get up.

23:42.790 --> 23:45.031
- Where is it? Where's the Cipro?
- I don't know.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.291
I'm not messing around here.
What did you do with it?

23:47.380 --> 23:48.586
I have no idea.

23:48.670 --> 23:51.173
Don't lie to me! Where's the Cipro?

23:51.260 --> 23:53.922
I didn't take it.
I pulled over to get diesel.

23:54.010 --> 23:55.841
Killed the dead when
they broke out of the bus.

23:58.060 --> 23:59.345
Tell me.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.686
It's not my fault it's not there.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.021
Sometimes you can't help people.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.696
Go.

24:14.660 --> 24:16.070
You know what it's like out there.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.038
You said you'd just be the guy
that pulled a gun on me!

24:19.120 --> 24:21.862
You didn't believe me
when I tried to say otherwise!

24:28.420 --> 24:31.412
Yeah... I didn't.

24:37.470 --> 24:38.676
Go!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.536
Al, where is it?

25:02.620 --> 25:03.996
Where's the medicine?

25:04.080 --> 25:05.661
A/, where is it?

25:11.300 --> 25:13.928
Please answer me. Where is it?

26:14.990 --> 26:17.732
Al, can't find it.

26:20.030 --> 26:23.158
A/, can you hear me? You okay?

26:24.160 --> 26:25.286
Shit.

26:42.970 --> 26:44.130
Please pick up, ,4/.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.026
Ai, do you copy?

27:04.040 --> 27:06.247
- Go for Al.
- I've looked everywhere! I can't find it.

27:06.330 --> 27:07.957
Where is the medicine?

27:12.040 --> 27:15.498
There isn't any.
I just wanted to get the van back.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.356
Thank you.

27:46.950 --> 27:48.656
You're lucky there was Augmentin
on that bus.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.495
Yep.

27:54.380 --> 27:58.919
Well, I've ridden out much worse in places
less hospitable than this.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.290
You could have died.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.637
I could have died.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.426
But you didn't. I didn't.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.227
We just have to get to it.
Get diesel.

28:14.310 --> 28:17.222
- You lied, Al.
- I motivated you.

28:17.320 --> 28:20.027
I almost killed someone
to get medICIne that wasn't there!

28:20.110 --> 28:22.442
A someone who stole my van.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.526
- You don't get it.
- No, I get it.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.446
I do. But you didn't kill that guy.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.661
I almost did.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.167
I was trying so hard
to not be that person,

28:37.710 --> 28:39.337
running from who I was

28:39.800 --> 28:41.165
from what I had done...

28:41.590 --> 28:43.672
That I almost became her again.

28:51.350 --> 28:53.261
Why is that van so important to you?

28:53.350 --> 28:55.432
I told you.
It's what's gonna keep us alive.

28:56.060 --> 28:57.186
It's...

28:58.650 --> 29:00.220
You say the truth matters.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.560
- It does.
- Are you telling me the truth?

29:05.200 --> 29:06.565
The whole thing?

29:10.870 --> 29:11.746
The...

29:14.120 --> 29:16.702
The tapes, the stories
I have locked in my van,

29:17.170 --> 29:20.492
that is all that's left of pretty much
all the people I've ever interviewed.

29:20.710 --> 29:22.086
People you barely knew?

29:22.880 --> 29:24.256
Not all of them.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.505
But you saw...

29:29.350 --> 29:31.716
You saw what just one
of those stories did for Alicia.

29:32.680 --> 29:33.977
Right.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.510
But you can't help people if you're dead.

29:46.860 --> 29:50.239
It isn't just other people's stories

29:52.750 --> 29:54.240
on the tapes.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.627
It's my story. It's the...

30:02.300 --> 30:03.790
It's the people I knew.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.460
People I loved.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.880
And I'm not gonna leave them behind.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.027
If you're out there
and if you can still hear me,

31:09.860 --> 31:11.771
I am at mile marker 27.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.321
But I don't think I can
stick around much longer.

31:16.910 --> 31:19.071
M/ie marker 27.

31:24.670 --> 31:25.796
Hello?

31:28.970 --> 31:30.540
We're packing up to leave.

31:31.470 --> 31:33.961
But I just wanted to say it once more...

31:34.050 --> 31:35.711
5177/ out here look/ng for you.

31:35.810 --> 31:39.519
M/ie marker 27 on Highway 365 westbound.

31:39.770 --> 31:41.476
- But I ’m gonna have to move on.
- It's Morgan.

31:41.850 --> 31:43.727
Morgan, it's June. I'm with Al.

31:45.860 --> 31:46.975
Morgan?

31:49.780 --> 31:50.940
Morgan?

31:52.410 --> 31:53.650
Morgan?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.730
- Here, give it here.
- What happened?

32:02.080 --> 32:03.320
Battery's dead.

32:11.340 --> 32:13.638
He's 50 miles away. We have enough gas.
We can make it.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.597
- We just have to hurry.
- We can't just abandon the van.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.216
We need it.

32:17.510 --> 32:19.171
If we don't leave now, we will miss him.

32:19.350 --> 32:21.227
- We'll catch up.
- You don't know that.

32:21.310 --> 32:22.470
We have to leave now.

32:29.070 --> 32:31.482
If you wanna go, go.

32:34.570 --> 32:36.197
Morgan's out there.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.861
Which means John and the others
might be, too.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.169
Al, we're here.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.086
We're alive.

32:50.340 --> 32:52.376
What's on those tapes might be
all that's left of some people,

32:52.470 --> 32:54.335
but it doesn't have to be
that way for you.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.076
Would have walkied, but the battery...

34:12.380 --> 34:13.665
Let's go.

34:24.350 --> 34:27.342
Hey, man. I don't think they comin'.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.357
Doesn't look that way.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.481
Hey, you know what we say?

34:35.030 --> 34:37.487
Or what the man we stole
the truck from said,

34:37.910 --> 34:40.731
"When the road get to buckin',
keep on truckin'."

35:00.180 --> 35:02.000
I know the look of a man
who needs a drink.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.066
We got a bogie at the back door.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.911
Morgan.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.621
- My walkie died.
- You're here now.

35:39.260 --> 35:41.421
That's what matters.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.011
John? Everyone else?

35:52.350 --> 35:53.601
Still looking.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.776
New people?

35:59.190 --> 36:00.737
You know I like new people.

36:01.070 --> 36:04.858
Yeah, this is, um,
Wendell, Sarah, and that's Jim.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.787
- Al.
-June.

36:08.790 --> 36:11.452
Could we maybe get them some food, please?

36:21.180 --> 36:22.624
- Thank you.
- Yes.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.715
Thank you.

36:28.850 --> 36:31.637
These boxes, were you the ones?

36:32.020 --> 36:33.556
No, somebody left them.

36:34.310 --> 36:35.857
Person who owns this truck.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.725
Trying to take it back to him.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.856
And we're making some drops along the way.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.389
You're helping people.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.690
Can I borrow your walkie?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.490
Yeah.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.911
I don't know your name.

36:59.170 --> 37:00.751
I don't even know if you're listening.

37:02.260 --> 37:04.171
But you were the last time
I did this. So...

37:07.140 --> 37:08.596
If you can hear me,

37:11.230 --> 37:13.130
I'm sorry about what I did.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.299
I'm sorry I made you walk away.

37:18.190 --> 37:20.397
But I want to show you that you're wrong.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.942
Sometimes we don't just watch out
for the people we know.

37:29.870 --> 37:33.112
Mile marker 27 on 365.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.667
I'm with a group of people.
We've got food.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.990
Water. Supplies.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.967
Everything you need
to get back on your feet.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.426
Is that you, C/pro?

37:53.020 --> 37:54.556
Yeah, that's me.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.477
Managed to find some diesel.

37:57.850 --> 37:59.010
Came hack.

37:59.150 --> 38:01.721
Your friend rea//y shou/dn ’t
/ea ve her ride sitting around.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.062
We're gonna go look for some people.
You want to come along?

38:08.280 --> 38:10.191
You won't be that guy
that pointed a gun at me.

38:10.410 --> 38:13.197
You'd just be someone who's going with us
to help some people.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.116
You won't be who you were.

38:18.790 --> 38:20.951
Quinn. The name’s Quinn.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.962
June. Mine's June.

38:34.930 --> 38:37.558
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:40.020 --> 38:43.183
Yeah, something hit me hard back there.

38:44.070 --> 38:45.435
Got pretty sick.

38:52.950 --> 38:55.282
Looks like you found
a new ride to Alexandria.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.586
You know, you're still welcome to join.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.096
Just so you know,

39:18.560 --> 39:21.358
when I stay with people, I stay.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.779
But I don't plan on staying,
once I get this story.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.201
What do you know about
the guy this truck belonged to?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.160
Not much.

39:47.630 --> 39:49.586
He left some journals in the glove box.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.460
Him and some other people.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.671
They kept the roads clear.

39:57.220 --> 40:00.849
Had power. Had water.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.437
I really wish I had my camera.

40:16.330 --> 40:17.445
You messing with me, Cipro?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.865
What are you talking about?

40:21.830 --> 40:23.240
You said mile marker 27?

40:23.330 --> 40:24.877
I'm at mile marker 27.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.541
Cou/d’ye swore I just passed 20, though.

40:32.300 --> 40:33.881
Check again.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.176
I'm looking at it right now.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.306
I'm telling you. Mile marker 27.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.240
Quinn?

41:06.170 --> 41:07.239
Are you there?

41:11.380 --> 41:13.336
Do you copy?

41:16.890 --> 41:18.460
Are you there?

41:21.770 --> 41:23.476
Quinn, do you copy?

41:30.480 --> 41:32.607
I have to let you go now, Purvis.

41:37.740 --> 41:40.903
You did what you were supposed to do.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.116
Now...

41:47.670 --> 41:51.208
I'm gonna set you free
to keep on doing it.

42:16.320 --> 42:20.324
You aren't going to be weak any more.
