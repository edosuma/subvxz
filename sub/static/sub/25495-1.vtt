true happiness.

and I'm gonna make it work.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.559
And I feel like a lot of the
Mormon community was like,

23:40.583 --> 23:42.476
Woo-hoo! Look at this!

23:42.500 --> 23:44.226
He's gay and he's Mormon.
He's gonna make it work.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.850
What does that mean?
Maybe he's celibate?

23:45.874 --> 23:47.714
I don't know, but hey,
he's gonna make it work.

23:47.738 --> 23:48.893
He's happy. You know?

23:48.917 --> 23:51.351
I started dating a
guy openly, and...

23:51.375 --> 23:54.810
I took him to Temple Square.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.017
For me, it was like, when
you and I have a kid,

23:57.041 --> 24:00.476
we're raising him Mormon,
and this means a lot to me.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.059
And about a month after that,

24:03.083 --> 24:04.559
um, it was November 5th,

24:04.583 --> 24:08.059
and a po... The
policy was leaked.

24:08.083 --> 24:10.518
The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints

24:10.542 --> 24:13.309
has come under intense scrutiny
following their new official

24:13.333 --> 24:16.643
orders against homosexuality,
baptism and children.

24:16.667 --> 24:19.601
The new policy change states
that same-sex couples

24:19.625 --> 24:21.351
will also now be
considered apostates,

24:21.375 --> 24:24.518
saying it will no longer
bless or baptize children

24:24.542 --> 24:28.101
of same-sex couples until
the child turns 18.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.601
Once a child turns 18,

24:29.625 --> 24:32.351
he or she will have to
disavow same-sex marriage,

24:32.375 --> 24:35.625
then they can be blessed and
baptized by the church.

24:39.083 --> 24:41.726
It suddenly felt dark, and I'd
never felt dark at church.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.768
I'd always felt like,
this is the safe place,

24:43.792 --> 24:45.101
and I need to cling to this.

24:45.125 --> 24:49.518
Um, I'm watching my
brother baptize his son,

24:49.542 --> 24:51.393
and he, and I don't
ever get to do that

24:51.417 --> 24:54.434
because I'm gay and he's
straight, and, um...

24:54.458 --> 24:56.976
I just had taken, you know...

24:57.000 --> 25:00.500
the guy I was seeing to the temple
and I was doing all of these...

25:01.917 --> 25:04.518
these things to sort
of remain, and I...

25:04.542 --> 25:07.101
It just hit me that
I have to leave.

25:07.125 --> 25:08.810
And I remember...

25:08.834 --> 25:12.125
telling my mom on the way to
dinner after the baptism.

25:14.583 --> 25:16.559
I'm like, Mom, I, I...

25:16.583 --> 25:19.351
I believe, and I, um...

25:19.375 --> 25:20.855
and I know the Book
of Mormon is true.

25:20.879 --> 25:22.679
I know the church is true,
but I have to leave

25:22.703 --> 25:24.976
because, like, they've
clearly drawn a line,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.667
and it feels like the last,
you know, gut punch.

like, the apostles' faces.

26:17.583 --> 26:20.267
A lot of Mormons saw
that and were, like,

26:20.291 --> 26:22.309
offended and angry at Tyler.

26:22.333 --> 26:25.518
And then I think a lot of Mormons
saw it and were hurt for Tyler.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.667
like, two years ago.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.959
You know, I've watched
you over the last...

27:11.041 --> 27:12.184
you know, couple years,

27:12.208 --> 27:14.267
and I've watched you
just go through this,

27:14.291 --> 27:15.601
and I've been like,

27:15.625 --> 27:17.643
a really...

27:17.667 --> 27:19.685
shitty bystander, honestly.

27:21.041 --> 27:23.851
I just want to, like, apologize
because I feel like,

27:23.875 --> 27:26.041
you know, I feel like,

27:27.500 --> 27:29.851
you know, I don't know who else

27:29.875 --> 27:31.595
you could relate to...
How many other people

27:31.619 --> 27:33.659
you could relate to in this
industry that are, like,

27:33.683 --> 27:36.518
Mormon, and have to
feel conflicted about

27:36.542 --> 27:38.351
all these things,
and I don't know...

27:38.375 --> 27:40.643
Dude, thanks. That really means a lot.
Thank you.

27:40.667 --> 27:42.184
Wow, that's really cool.

27:42.208 --> 27:43.851
Seriously. Seriously.

27:43.875 --> 27:46.685
But the question I wanted
to ask you is, what now?

27:46.709 --> 27:48.518
Like, what can I do...

27:48.542 --> 27:50.893
I know. To what can, like...

27:50.917 --> 27:52.917
You know, I had, like, this
little idea in my head,

27:52.941 --> 27:54.059
and tell me if it's stupid.

27:54.083 --> 27:57.393
What if me and you got
together, and we put on, like,

27:57.417 --> 27:59.226
a big event in Salt Lake City?

27:59.250 --> 28:02.041
Me, you, some people who can
come together, and be, like...

28:03.375 --> 28:06.309
inclusive of everybody,
and tell them all, like,

28:06.333 --> 28:07.726
this needs to change.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.950
You know, I know we can't force
the church to change it,

28:09.974 --> 28:12.518
but maybe we can, like, by
raising more awareness,

28:12.542 --> 28:13.893
and making more Mormons,

28:13.917 --> 28:16.184
in their heart, feel
like this isn't right,

28:16.208 --> 28:17.893
maybe that's the begin...
You know what I mean?

28:17.917 --> 28:19.157
Maybe that's what's gonna start

28:19.181 --> 28:20.661
the change. That's
what it takes, man.

28:20.685 --> 28:22.226
Dude, I'm down.
Like, absolutely.

28:22.250 --> 28:23.267
Let's do it.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.559
I'm like, we're gonna
do this amazing thing!

28:29.583 --> 28:32.643
This is for Mormons,
this is for non-Mormons.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.935
This is for the
LGBT non-Mormons,

28:34.959 --> 28:38.059
LGBT Mormons. Like, this is
for the world to come to.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.403
So, you know what
I thought about?

28:39.427 --> 28:40.907
First thing that came to my mind?
What?

28:40.931 --> 28:43.476
Food. What are we
gonna do for food?

28:43.500 --> 28:46.434
If we can get food
trucks, awesome.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.768
That's what I think.
I'm thinking food,

28:47.792 --> 28:49.312
and really what I
should be thinking is

28:49.336 --> 28:51.643
how do we not offend 50 percent
of the people who come?

28:51.667 --> 28:53.187
You're just trying
to enlighten people.

28:53.211 --> 28:54.810
You're not trying
to offend anyone.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.267
See what you just said right there?
Enlighten people.

28:57.291 --> 28:59.142
You think that's offensive?
That says to people,

28:59.166 --> 29:01.810
you're in the dark,
let me enlighten you.

29:01.834 --> 29:03.976
No, no, no, no, no. Educate.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.935
You're stupid, let
me educate you.

29:05.959 --> 29:07.768
No. That's not true.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.434
I think people don't
know statistics.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.559
They don't know the reality
of what's happening.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.351
You can't come in and
say, "You're wrong."

29:13.375 --> 29:15.476
No. You have to come in and say,

29:15.500 --> 29:17.476
"Let's talk, and believe in

29:17.500 --> 29:19.740
the goodness of people." You
have to change people's minds

29:19.764 --> 29:21.142
as a friend and an ally.

29:21.166 --> 29:22.976
You don't have to
change people's minds.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.280
They have to change their minds.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.976
We have to, like, in my
opinion, it's like...

29:27.000 --> 29:28.768
Did you put boloney in this?

29:28.792 --> 29:30.101
There's ham in there.

29:30.125 --> 29:31.935
It's really weird tasting.
Is it?

29:31.959 --> 29:33.759
We don't usually put ham
in sandwiches, right?

29:33.783 --> 29:36.183
This is the first time. No, but
it's, like, what was in there.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.518
The Mormon... This is where
I was raised, Mormonism.

29:38.542 --> 29:40.685
So, this is my community,
these are my people.

29:40.709 --> 29:42.810
That's the last thing
that I want to do

29:42.834 --> 29:44.643
is to say, "I'm
right, you're wrong."

29:44.667 --> 29:46.107
"Look, come and let
me tell you why."

29:46.131 --> 29:48.434
It needs to be, everybody
come to the table

29:48.458 --> 29:50.351
and let's see what's happening.

29:50.375 --> 29:53.226
This is... these are the
people who are in it.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.601
You know. Yeah.

29:54.625 --> 29:57.559
Their message is 10 times more
powerful than me getting up,

29:57.583 --> 30:00.351
Hey, I'm the singer of Imagine Dragons.
You know that song?

30:00.375 --> 30:02.976
♪ Radioactive! Radioactive! ♪

30:03.000 --> 30:05.400
Now let me tell you everything
that I know about this subject

30:05.424 --> 30:07.101
because I really don't
know that much,

30:07.125 --> 30:08.976
and everybody's gonna be like...

30:09.000 --> 30:12.142
I'm all heart. I'm... The
education is yet to come.

30:13.750 --> 30:15.059
So...

30:15.083 --> 30:16.959
Oh gosh. Well, hey,

30:17.875 --> 30:19.559
we are kind of all heart.

30:26.709 --> 30:27.792
John, how you doing?

30:28.709 --> 30:30.685
Good, how are you, Dan? Hey.

30:30.709 --> 30:32.851
It's an honor to, uh...

30:32.875 --> 30:34.226
to, to talk and to meet.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.685
Right back at you.
Yeah. Virtually.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.142
Can you hear and see me okay?

30:37.166 --> 30:39.059
Yeah, I, I hear and
I see you good.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.518
Um, you're a little choppy
here and there, but not bad.

30:41.542 --> 30:44.309
I'll close a bunch of
windows and just make sure.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.935
Yeah, are you playing World of
Warcraft while you're talking to me?

30:46.959 --> 30:50.017
No, I'm not.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.184
My name is John Dehlin,

30:51.208 --> 30:54.017
and I'm a
sixth-generation Mormon,

30:54.041 --> 30:58.059
raised, uh, as a devout
orthodox-believing Mormon.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.601
Mormonism was everything to me

30:59.625 --> 31:01.059
'cause my parents
had been divorced,

31:01.083 --> 31:04.184
and I felt like the church took
care of me and nurtured me

31:04.208 --> 31:06.101
when my family was
falling apart.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.810
In 2009, I started a PhD

31:07.834 --> 31:10.184
in clinical and
counseling psychology.

31:10.208 --> 31:14.518
I was just noticing all these LGBT Mormons
that were depressed and suicidal,

31:14.542 --> 31:15.893
and, um...

31:15.917 --> 31:18.434
the church was encouraging
mixed orientation marriages,

31:18.458 --> 31:20.976
where you're gay, but you
marry a straight person.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.267
I am a Mormon.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.976
I'm a father of six children,

31:28.000 --> 31:29.601
and I am attracted to men.

31:29.625 --> 31:32.059
The attractions
aren't gonna go away.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.935
They're gonna be
there my whole life,

31:33.959 --> 31:37.559
but I don't feel that I'm
losing anything in my life.

31:37.583 --> 31:39.768
To me, that's being authentic,

31:39.792 --> 31:43.893
is it's finding that core
happiness within you.

31:43.917 --> 31:46.685
And for me, it's important
that that core happiness

31:46.709 --> 31:49.810
is aligned with my
beliefs in the gospel.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.226
That know that I'm gay,

31:56.250 --> 31:58.101
I'm able to be myself.

31:58.125 --> 32:01.393
And I'm not having to

32:01.417 --> 32:04.184
make up excuses of
why I'm not dating

32:04.208 --> 32:07.393
or I'm not married or I'm
not falling in love.

32:07.417 --> 32:10.226
What's been so great
about this experience

32:10.250 --> 32:13.059
is that I've been
able to understand

32:13.083 --> 32:14.851
what really makes me happy,

32:14.875 --> 32:18.184
and that is pleasing God.

32:18.208 --> 32:20.267
So, we decided to study, uh,

32:20.291 --> 32:24.309
what decisions led to healthy
outcomes for LGBT people,

32:24.333 --> 32:26.726
and what decisions led
to unhealthy outcomes.

32:26.750 --> 32:27.810
♪ ♪

32:27.834 --> 32:30.685
I just wanted to understand
a couple things.

32:30.709 --> 32:33.768
Can you change being gay
or lesbian if you try?

32:33.792 --> 32:36.351
What happens if you just
try to be celibate?

32:36.375 --> 32:39.851
What happens if you just
try and marry a woman?

32:39.875 --> 32:42.393
Mixed orientation marriages
were a disaster.

32:42.417 --> 32:45.184
Celibacy was the worst
possible option

32:45.208 --> 32:47.393
that they could have chosen.

32:47.417 --> 32:48.393
Uh...

32:48.417 --> 32:49.851
Hundreds and hundreds
of the people

32:49.875 --> 32:51.851
mentioned suicide in
their narratives,

32:51.875 --> 32:54.768
of wanting to kill themselves
because of the struggle.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.851
Feeling like God
didn't love 'em,

32:56.875 --> 32:58.393
that God wouldn't heal them,

32:58.417 --> 33:01.685
and so they must have been
beyond God's love and power.

33:05.375 --> 33:07.351
We've seen the suicide rates

33:07.375 --> 33:09.935
of youth between the
ages of 15 and 19

33:09.959 --> 33:11.893
double in the past
two to three years,

33:11.917 --> 33:15.976
and triple over the past eight
or nine years since 2008.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.935
Nowhere else in the entire
United States are we seeing

33:19.959 --> 33:23.476
youth suicide rates
double and triple

33:23.500 --> 33:25.810
over that same time period.

33:25.834 --> 33:27.726
And so, what's the cause?

33:27.750 --> 33:30.059
What happened in 2007, 2008?

33:30.083 --> 33:33.226
It was when the
predominant religion

33:33.250 --> 33:38.333
within the state of Utah
declares war on LGBT people.

33:39.625 --> 33:41.226
Today, I'd like to explain

33:41.250 --> 33:44.125
how I became an LGBT
ally as a Mormon.

33:45.041 --> 33:48.976
I gave a TED Talk in, uh, 2013.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.434
I want to begin by
making a point.

33:51.458 --> 33:55.351
That you can literally
save the lives

33:55.375 --> 33:57.976
of your LGBT brothers
and sisters,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.559
sons and daughters,
through love.

34:00.583 --> 34:05.935
Well, I gave the TED Talk in,
like, October or November, 2013,

34:05.959 --> 34:08.559
and by January or
February of 2014,

34:08.583 --> 34:10.518
my bishop had called me in,

34:10.542 --> 34:12.101
and, uh, told me he was starting

34:12.125 --> 34:14.726
an investigation
into my membership.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.518
And in February of 2015,

34:16.542 --> 34:18.226
I was excommunicated
from the church.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.851
Hmm. There's no doubt in my mind

34:20.875 --> 34:23.726
that my public support
of LGBT people

34:23.750 --> 34:25.792
was a major factor in
my excommunication.

34:27.291 --> 34:30.141
Excommunication is
about the worst thing

34:30.166 --> 34:31.893
that a Mormon could
ever experience.

34:31.917 --> 34:35.101
It basically means, from
a religious perspective,

34:35.125 --> 34:38.434
that you're cut off from your
family for all of eternity.

34:38.458 --> 34:39.851
That your family's gonna go

34:39.875 --> 34:41.601
to this really nice
place in heaven,

34:41.625 --> 34:44.935
and you're gonna be alone,
uh, in a dark, sad place,

34:44.958 --> 34:46.476
and that's what
excommunication means.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.685
It means you can't
participate in church.

34:48.708 --> 34:52.309
It's basically condemning you to
the Mormon equivalent of hell.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.601
And it was... But
more than that,

34:54.625 --> 34:56.851
it's cutting you off
from your tribe.

34:56.875 --> 34:58.355
It's cutting you off
from your people,

34:58.379 --> 35:00.810
from your friends,
from your family.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.893
Uh, I have family members
that won't speak to me.

35:02.917 --> 35:06.559
Um, and it's... devastating.

35:06.583 --> 35:09.083
Oh, man. Uh...

35:10.500 --> 35:14.976
My family is all Mormon,
and they're very active.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.643
I have a... I have a real
fear of losing all that.

35:19.667 --> 35:22.976
Maybe you've heard
the quote, um,

35:23.000 --> 35:27.184
"The only thing required
for evil to persist

35:27.208 --> 35:28.810
is for good men to do nothing."

35:28.834 --> 35:31.643
You've probably heard that, right?
I have. Yeah.

35:31.667 --> 35:32.851
I've always loved the church.

35:32.875 --> 35:35.643
I still do. I still
consider myself Mormon.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.726
Um... and so... But I felt
the same way you did.

35:38.750 --> 35:42.726
I didn't want to leave it. I
didn't want to be excommunicated.

35:42.750 --> 35:46.518
I do think the number of
overt bigots out there,

35:46.542 --> 35:49.142
as a percentage,
is really small,

35:49.166 --> 35:51.810

44:32.667 --> 44:35.393
uh, marriage or committed
relationship is evil,

44:35.417 --> 44:38.059
they're not just saying
that as their own opinion.

44:38.083 --> 44:40.017
They're basically
saying that God speaks

44:40.041 --> 44:43.250
to the leader of our church
and takes that position.

44:44.500 --> 44:46.851
As the church has
seen in the past,

44:46.875 --> 44:48.768
when the church
takes a position,

44:48.792 --> 44:51.351
and then the rest of
the nation changes,

44:51.375 --> 44:54.559
so in the late 1800s, the
church was a polygamous church,

44:54.583 --> 44:56.976
and the rest of the nation
wasn't cool with that,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.059
uh, the church was
almost destroyed,

44:59.083 --> 45:00.363
and so, the church
had to change.

45:00.387 --> 45:03.643
Fast-forward to the 1960s,
the whole United States

45:03.667 --> 45:08.059
is starting to support
African-Americans and civil rights.

45:08.083 --> 45:12.351
And the LDS church is opposing,
um, the civil rights movement

45:12.375 --> 45:15.309
and that almost
destroyed the church.

45:15.333 --> 45:17.726
And so in 1978, the
church changes again.

45:17.750 --> 45:22.309
He has heard our prayers, and
by revelation has confirmed

45:22.333 --> 45:23.643
that the long promised day

45:23.667 --> 45:26.851
has come, when every
faithful, worthy man

45:26.875 --> 45:28.976
in the church may receive
the holy priesthood.

45:31.625 --> 45:34.768
The church eventually accepted
blacks into full fellowship.

45:34.792 --> 45:37.267
Accordingly, all worthy
male members of the church

45:37.291 --> 45:39.685
may be ordained to the chur...
To the priesthood

45:39.709 --> 45:43.267
without regard for
race or color.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.976
Now is the time, God has spoken,

45:47.000 --> 45:48.643
now you can have the priesthood.

45:48.667 --> 45:51.559
The thing is you're not
going to change God's will,

45:51.583 --> 45:52.875
is basically what my mom said.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.320
My mom said to me,
when I told her

45:54.344 --> 45:55.784
I was doing this,
she was like, well,

45:55.808 --> 45:57.643
just because you're
a rock star dude,

45:57.667 --> 45:59.101
you can't change God's will.

45:59.125 --> 46:00.518
While we are to value

46:00.542 --> 46:03.935
the rights and feelings
of all of God's children,

46:03.959 --> 46:08.643
we cannot change his doctrine.
It is not ours to change.

46:08.667 --> 46:12.476
False prophets and false
teachers are those who

46:12.500 --> 46:15.226
attempt to change the God-given,

46:15.250 --> 46:17.267
and scripturally based doctrines

46:17.291 --> 46:19.518
that protect the
sanctity of marriage.

46:20.750 --> 46:22.393
On the brethren's door,
and you're, like,

46:22.417 --> 46:24.518
Thomas S. Monson, come
on, change this, man.

46:24.542 --> 46:25.976
Come on, change it!

46:26.000 --> 46:28.101
He's not gonna change it
for you, 'cause God's...

46:28.125 --> 46:29.725
He's only doing what
God tells him to do,

46:29.749 --> 46:31.393
and God's not gonna
change it for you.

46:31.417 --> 46:34.101
But if all the members of a church
are talking about something,

46:34.125 --> 46:36.851
then the prophet's gonna
pray about it more, right?

46:36.875 --> 46:40.393
I think that maybe I'm one part
of this puzzle that's, like,

46:40.417 --> 46:42.685
you know, coming together,
and hopefully the apostles

46:42.709 --> 46:44.184
and the prophet
go pray about it,

46:44.208 --> 46:49.476
and God comes down and
tells them what's up.

46:49.500 --> 46:52.935
So, um, you know, there's
a glimmer of hope,

46:52.959 --> 46:55.601
and in the long-term, I think
there's a lot of hope.

46:55.625 --> 46:57.476
The question is, um,

46:57.500 --> 46:58.860
how long will it
take to get there,

been said, but love is love.

57:35.834 --> 57:38.476
Love is love. Thank you so much.

57:43.750 --> 57:47.434
Which is super intimidating and
scary for a million reasons

57:47.458 --> 57:50.851
because it feels like we're still
just getting stuff together.

57:52.542 --> 57:54.893
I'm here to make a very
special announcement.

57:54.917 --> 57:58.142
On August 26th, in
the Provo area,

57:58.166 --> 58:01.267
we're gonna be putting on a
concert called LoveLoud...

58:05.291 --> 58:08.726
And I don't want to say that
people were intentionally

58:08.750 --> 58:10.434
trying to curb this event.

58:10.458 --> 58:12.518
We can give them a
sponsorship, like a...

58:14.000 --> 58:16.434
it was a lot of people being
afraid to touch this issue.

58:19.917 --> 58:22.101
We're gonna show that
the whole state of Utah

58:22.125 --> 58:23.601
actually believes in this.

58:23.625 --> 58:28.959
The reality hitting me is that
not all of Utah wants this.

58:30.083 --> 58:31.643
I had tons of people
who were like,

58:31.667 --> 58:34.643
you shouldn't talk about
how we have, like,

58:34.667 --> 58:36.351
any issues with suicide.

58:36.375 --> 58:38.267
Let's not talk about that.

58:38.291 --> 58:39.979
I'm a little nervous
to even click on the

58:39.991 --> 58:41.691
comments section, to be
honest with you here.

58:41.715 --> 58:44.768
"I know many LGBTQ-XYZ people,

58:44.792 --> 58:47.393
"and while I treat them like
any other person I know,

58:47.417 --> 58:50.226
I don't agree with their choices
to live that lifestyle."

58:52.667 --> 58:57.309
why is this straight white guy
the poster child for this now?

58:57.333 --> 58:59.851
I don't know. People
love to hate, you know?

58:59.875 --> 59:01.518
So, we'll see what happens.

59:06.333 --> 59:07.601
P-O-Z.

59:07.625 --> 59:10.601
So I had no idea what that
was, so I googled it.

59:10.625 --> 59:13.935
"Gay slang, willing to have sex
with someone who is HIV positive

59:13.959 --> 59:15.375
by someone who is not."

59:16.542 --> 59:18.059
You start to feel,

59:18.083 --> 59:22.976
upset that it's, like,
so blatantly obvious.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.726
Like, look how obvious this is!

59:24.750 --> 59:27.309
Like, of course we have to
love and accept everybody.

59:27.333 --> 59:28.768
Come on, guys!

59:33.083 --> 59:38.309
Of LGBT individuals and
communities of faith,

59:38.333 --> 59:41.393
which requires sensitivity
on both sides,

59:41.417 --> 59:42.935
and a lot of nuance,

59:42.959 --> 59:46.267
and that is not an
easy spot to be

59:46.291 --> 59:47.976
when you're someone like Dan.

59:51.375 --> 59:54.768
And my family saw it, and
that's been a little difficult.

59:54.792 --> 59:57.476
Feeling like the family thinks
that I'm doing something wrong,

59:57.500 --> 59:59.810
or I'm, like, making them look
like bigots or something.

59:59.834 --> 01:00:03.226
That's, that's been, probably,
the hardest thing for me.

01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:09.476
Of not just, I wanna
help LGBT individuals

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.660
have more peace and love and
acceptance in their lives,

01:00:11.684 --> 01:00:14.226
but I'm gonna have an
event in Provo, Utah,

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:17.267
and I'm going to talk
about Mormon doctrine.

01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:20.226
Will you express it in
a way that sounds like

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.226
kicking somebody when they're
down or throwing a stone?

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.685
Or will it come across
as someone that's

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:28.434
putting his arms around his
fellow brothers and sisters,

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:31.476
and saying, hey,
let's do better.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.768
It makes the family nervous.

01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:36.267
But I love Dan and know
he wants to do good.

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:39.351

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.059
how big the church
is versus the band,

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:02.883
how influential the church
is versus the band.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.601
I guess if I really stand back
and look at it, it's like,

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:08.267
the band reaches
millions, millions,

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:11.893
and we put out a video and
it's like 500 million views.

01:10:21.375 --> 01:10:24.351
In Salt Lake City
that's sold out,

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:25.601
and it sold out super fast,

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:28.768
and it's 20,000 people plus.

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:31.393
We figured, oh, when
we do this LoveLoud,

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:32.601
it's just gonna sell out.

01:10:32.625 --> 01:10:35.476
And so, when we put up the
tickets, it's just nowhere

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.101
near selling as fast as an
Imagine Dragons show sells.

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:42.226
I mean, that tells you
everything you need to know.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:45.768
In order for Mormons to
feel safe to come to this,

01:10:45.792 --> 01:10:51.101
the truth is Mormons will
feel safe about something

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:53.625
when the prophet says to
feel safe about something.

01:10:57.417 --> 01:11:00.726
In the, the hierarchy
of the church.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:02.685
I don't know fully
what they look like.

01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:05.643
I hope that the church is
able to make a statement,

01:11:05.667 --> 01:11:07.226
and to let people know

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:10.810
that these conversations
are okay to have.

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:12.250
If the prophet said,

01:11:13.166 --> 01:11:17.059
"Hey, LoveLoud is cool,"

01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:21.768
then that would be incredible,
and that would shift,

01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:25.518
that would be, like, everything
I could ever hope for.

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:27.685
For me, that is a bridge

01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:29.643
that has never been, like,

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:33.935
that is not a bridge that,
that has been created.

01:11:33.959 --> 01:11:36.685
It would be the most amazing,

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.393
huge step of progress
if the church says,

01:11:38.417 --> 01:11:41.851
hey, there's this LGBTQ event,
and yeah, even the guy who's

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:44.434
behind it doesn't believe
that it's a sin to be gay,

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:46.893
and, well, here's a
stamp of approval.

01:11:46.917 --> 01:11:48.309
Like that, to me, I'm like...

01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:50.726
amazing! It'd be amazing.

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:53.226

15 years ago, I was
a student at BYU,

01:24:04.417 --> 01:24:06.559
and I was coming out,
and I was suicidal.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:10.351

from this little girl who stood up.

everybody that God loves her

because He made her. I mean,

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:20.434

to have that in my brain to say,

I don't have to be better
or try to be better.

and use of the
Family Proclamation,

01:36:21.583 --> 01:36:25.142
is one of those tests
for this generation.

01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:30.208
I pray for all Latter-day Saints
to stand firm in that test.

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:34.250
In light of LoveLoud,

01:36:35.667 --> 01:36:39.226
that, for me, was a dark day

01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:40.851
to say the least.

01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:42.917
It's a dark week, a dark month.

01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:58.017
If there's one thing my
Mormon values have taught me

01:36:58.041 --> 01:36:59.101
since I was young...

01:36:59.125 --> 01:37:00.393

about who you are,
what you believe,

01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:17.059
still do it, 100 percent.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.393
That spirit was the spirit that
carried me through my mission.

01:37:21.417 --> 01:37:26.351
I felt like I was
bearing my truth,

01:37:26.375 --> 01:37:29.184
regardless of what anybody
thought about me.

01:37:29.208 --> 01:37:32.226
That's all because of
Mormonism and my parents,

01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:36.101
and so they have all prepped
me for this moment now.

01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:40.559

01:37:55.417 --> 01:37:56.976
I will tell you that.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.976
Because they don't stop.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.726
I knocked 100 doors
to get into one door.

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:06.291
I knocked thousands of
doors on my mission.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.935
If there's one thing
I can guarantee,

01:38:09.959 --> 01:38:14.101
it's that I will continue
to knock this door

01:38:14.125 --> 01:38:15.768
until somebody answers.

01:39:05.917 --> 01:39:08.976
Because of LoveLoud, my
dad felt like he had

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.935
the permission to love and
accept me for who I am,

01:39:11.959 --> 01:39:15.810
and LoveLoud gave us a bonding,

01:39:15.834 --> 01:39:18.976
and that I am really
grateful for.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.476
It gave me the guts to talk
about my son's sexuality

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:24.434
in ways that I had never
been able to before.

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:26.810
I've had four people come
out to me since LoveLoud.

01:39:26.834 --> 01:39:30.518
They said that LoveLoud gave them
the courage to live their truth.

01:39:30.542 --> 01:39:34.810
LoveLoud gave me the
opportunity to tell my story,

01:39:34.834 --> 01:39:39.184
and declare that I am worth it
in front of thousands of people.

01:39:39.208 --> 01:39:42.309
LoveLoud gave my family
the chance to stand

01:39:42.333 --> 01:39:45.434
shoulder to shoulder with
our transgender son.

01:39:45.458 --> 01:39:48.935
And not only him, but with
neighbors and extended family,

01:39:48.959 --> 01:39:53.518
who never would have ever
shown up for an LGBT event.

01:39:53.542 --> 01:39:54.851
LoveLoud gave me hope,

01:39:54.875 --> 01:39:57.893
and inspiration that
things can change.

01:39:57.917 --> 01:40:01.267
That I, myself, can be a force
for good in my own community.

01:40:01.291 --> 01:40:03.434
Looking at this crowd
of thousands of people,

01:40:03.458 --> 01:40:06.309
I realize these are people I
don't have to be scared of.

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.559
There's a lot of support

01:40:07.583 --> 01:40:10.893
in my community that I
didn't realize was there,

01:40:10.917 --> 01:40:15.059
and it was honestly one of
the best days of my life.

01:40:15.083 --> 01:40:16.059
When I was 13, 14,

01:40:16.083 --> 01:40:19.893
I felt completely
isolated and silenced,

01:40:19.917 --> 01:40:22.309
and it hasn't even
been that long,

01:40:22.333 --> 01:40:24.500
and I just feel so hopeful

01:40:26.125 --> 01:40:28.768
about the future, and that

01:40:28.792 --> 01:40:31.583
things will just keep
getting better, and...

01:40:33.291 --> 01:40:34.643
I hope it does.
