00:02.089 --> 00:05.124
You are being watched.

00:05.126 --> 00:07.126
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.128 --> 00:11.797
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.799 --> 00:13.999
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:14.001 --> 00:15.834
but it sees everything...

00:15.836 --> 00:18.837
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.839 --> 00:21.907
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.909 --> 00:23.942
We don't.

00:23.944 --> 00:28.313
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.315 --> 00:30.148
You will never find us.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.150
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.152 --> 00:35.153
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

_

00:51.786 --> 00:53.894
_

01:02.180 --> 01:03.880
<i>This is Agent Bouchard.</i>

01:03.882 --> 01:05.248
<i>We have a suspect in custody</i>

01:05.250 --> 01:06.850
<i>but have not recovered</i>
<i>the artifact.</i>

01:06.852 --> 01:09.853
<i>I believe our thief</i>
<i>is still at large.</i>

01:14.291 --> 01:16.392
Ah, welcome back,
Mr. Reese.

01:16.394 --> 01:19.262
I see your time in Italy
was a sartorial success.

01:19.264 --> 01:20.563
What can I say?

01:20.565 --> 01:22.031
New suit, new man.

01:22.033 --> 01:24.400
New number.

01:24.402 --> 01:25.935
Welcome back.

01:25.937 --> 01:27.570
I do wish we had time
for a homecoming,

01:27.572 --> 01:29.705
but we just received one
about an hour ago.

01:29.707 --> 01:31.106
Meet Kelly Lin.

01:31.108 --> 01:32.775
Born in Shanghai,
raised mostly abroad,

01:32.777 --> 01:34.710
and recently immigrated
to the US,

01:34.712 --> 01:36.779
or so says her visa paperwork.

01:36.781 --> 01:39.482
She naturalized as a citizen
six months ago.

01:39.484 --> 01:41.684
- Is she a spy?
<i>- Certainly possible.</i>

01:41.686 --> 01:43.752
Right now, she's working
as a professional

01:43.754 --> 01:45.788
event planner in the city.

01:45.790 --> 01:48.723
Based on her international
reputation, she's quite good.

01:48.725 --> 01:50.258
I found her resume online.

01:50.260 --> 01:51.926
Impeccable references.

01:51.928 --> 01:53.928
Easiest way to get close
to an event planner

01:53.930 --> 01:55.464
is to attend an event.

01:55.466 --> 01:58.133
AWOL and air travel,
and he hasn't missed a beat.

01:58.135 --> 02:01.269
Ms. Lin has been hired to run
the new exhibit opening

02:01.271 --> 02:03.405
at the Metropolitan
Museum Of History.

02:03.407 --> 02:05.106
A bit of clever computer work

02:05.108 --> 02:06.975
put Ms. Shaw on
the platinum guest list.

02:06.977 --> 02:08.810
I'm a sucker for
watered-down booze

02:08.812 --> 02:10.144
and a mini-quiche.

02:10.145 --> 02:11.445
As a donor who RSVP'd,

02:11.447 --> 02:13.147
you'll be my plus-one,
Mr. Reese.

02:13.149 --> 02:14.482
Black tie optional.

02:14.484 --> 02:15.817
I'll steam my tux.

02:15.819 --> 02:18.853
And oil my--

02:18.855 --> 02:21.655
Finch, where's my spare weapon?

02:21.657 --> 02:23.991
I moved it to the history
section a week ago.

02:23.993 --> 02:26.093
Update your arsenal, John.

02:35.038 --> 02:37.270
It appears that the storm
has yet to pass, Mr. Reese.

02:37.272 --> 02:38.972
Will you be needing
an umbrella?

02:38.974 --> 02:41.808
Only if it doubles
as a tactical weapon, Finch.

02:43.444 --> 02:45.612
I'll give this one
to Ms. Shaw.

02:45.614 --> 02:47.681
I'll just make a dash for it.

02:48.950 --> 02:50.617
Hand-sewn button holes,

02:50.619 --> 02:53.219
including one on the lapel.

02:53.221 --> 02:55.188
Impeccable craftsmanship.

02:55.190 --> 02:59.059
I see that Gianni
has spared no detail.

02:59.061 --> 03:02.828
Oh, I gotta raise my game up

03:02.830 --> 03:05.065
if I gotta be seen
with you, Finch.

03:08.369 --> 03:10.502
It's just like
a shoelace, Mr. Reese.

03:10.504 --> 03:13.372
I find that it helps
if you practice on a leg

03:13.374 --> 03:17.043
or a collarless neck
if you're out of practice.

03:17.045 --> 03:19.045
I can field strip
a .45 upside down

03:19.047 --> 03:20.479
in the dark, Finch.

03:20.481 --> 03:22.247
I think I can handle a bow tie.

03:22.249 --> 03:24.016
Of course.

03:25.652 --> 03:28.554
Is it butterfly or batwing?

03:28.556 --> 03:30.389
Never mind, take your time.

03:36.829 --> 03:39.898
Hate to interrupt this
mildly erotic moment, gents,

03:39.900 --> 03:42.767
but the invitation advises us
not to be late.

03:44.336 --> 03:45.804
What?

03:45.806 --> 03:48.873
Well, I see you've
updated your arsenal, Shaw.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.409
Oh, I can work it,

03:51.411 --> 03:53.277
along with the .380
I've got in my handbag.

03:53.279 --> 03:55.947
So watch it.

03:55.949 --> 03:58.850
Can we go now?

04:08.094 --> 04:10.961
Special exhibit, Finch?

04:10.963 --> 04:12.763
A partnership of museums
around the world

04:12.765 --> 04:14.265
loaned some of
their most significant

04:14.267 --> 04:18.101
cultural artifacts to use
in this one single exhibit.

04:18.103 --> 04:20.738
Something like that
doesn't happen often.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.405
Abomination.

04:22.407 --> 04:24.574
Misappropriation.

04:24.576 --> 04:27.044
Sounds pretty aggressive
out there.

04:27.046 --> 04:28.912
They believe that
cultural artifacts

04:28.914 --> 04:31.314
belong to the cultures
they came from.

04:31.316 --> 04:34.050
<i>Sounds like a bunch of
hippies and art nerds to me.</i>

04:34.052 --> 04:36.419
<i>Still, they could
be a threat to Kelly.</i>

04:36.421 --> 04:37.887
<i>She is running the event.</i>

04:37.889 --> 04:40.056
Speak of the devil.

04:40.058 --> 04:42.959
Kelly, what am I hearing?

04:42.961 --> 04:44.394
I've got head of security
on my ass

04:44.396 --> 04:47.130
about coolers of dry ice
in the event space.

04:47.132 --> 04:48.831
Yes, sir, I've heard that too.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.466
I don't have a PO for those.

04:50.468 --> 04:51.834
I think it was
a shipping mistake.

04:51.836 --> 04:53.269
I won't pay for the mistake.

04:53.271 --> 04:54.637
I spoke to my suppliers,

04:54.639 --> 04:56.238
the museum won't
be charged a dime.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.907
Plus, they've offered
to upgrade

04:57.909 --> 04:59.308
tonight's champagne selection

04:59.310 --> 05:02.011
from yellow label to rose.

05:02.013 --> 05:06.848
Oh. Well...
I do enjoy a nice rose.

05:11.155 --> 05:13.422
Oh, my. Dear?

05:20.231 --> 05:22.330
Finch, there's no sign
of danger in here,

05:22.332 --> 05:24.265
not counting the shrimp puffs.

05:24.267 --> 05:26.434
<i>That was an impressive move.</i>

05:26.436 --> 05:30.005
Saved me having
to get paramedics in here.

05:30.007 --> 05:32.107
Right place, right time.

05:32.109 --> 05:33.742
Do you know who he was?

05:33.744 --> 05:37.645
Warren Zimm,
big-time investment banker.

05:37.647 --> 05:39.647
Think, that whole empire
down the drain.

05:39.649 --> 05:41.148
From one cunning shellfish.

05:41.150 --> 05:42.350
Mm-hmm.

05:42.352 --> 05:44.519
You know, you have
a beautiful accent,

05:44.521 --> 05:47.755
and I have an ear for it,
but I can't place it.

05:47.757 --> 05:49.624
Where are you from originally?

05:49.626 --> 05:51.726
I spent a few years
in a Hong Kong,

05:51.728 --> 05:53.695
some international schooling.

05:53.697 --> 05:55.229
Since then,
I've picked up traces

05:55.231 --> 05:56.864
from a little bit
of everywhere.

05:56.866 --> 05:58.032
Huh.

05:58.034 --> 05:59.200
Well, enjoy the rest
of your evening.

05:59.202 --> 06:01.902
Oh, yes, thank you.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.304
Kelly's good in this crowd.

06:04.306 --> 06:07.942
Charming, casually evasive.

06:07.944 --> 06:10.044
Who would want to
put a bull's-eye on her?

06:10.046 --> 06:12.045
We don't know that
anyone did, yet.

06:12.047 --> 06:14.381
Wren, Harold.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.986
Of course, Harold Wren
and guest.

06:21.689 --> 06:22.956
Please keep these on tonight,

06:22.958 --> 06:25.992
to show you're all checked in.

06:26.994 --> 06:29.996
Oh, my, he's gorgeous.

06:33.901 --> 06:38.071
Fancy stuff, fancy guests.

06:39.306 --> 06:40.807
A job like this
could give Kelly

06:40.809 --> 06:42.842
access to all of them,

06:42.844 --> 06:45.844
and maybe all of their
dirty little secrets.

06:45.846 --> 06:49.415
Mr. Reese,
do you know what this is?

06:49.417 --> 06:51.350
It's the Nowell Codex.

06:51.352 --> 06:53.586
It's over 1,000 years old.

06:53.588 --> 06:56.389
Yeah, it's beautiful,
but I think

06:56.391 --> 06:58.591
we should keep our eyes
on the prize in here,

06:58.593 --> 06:59.725
don't you think?

07:01.028 --> 07:02.594
<i>Everyone, everyone,</i>

07:02.596 --> 07:04.096
<i>there seems to be a problem.</i>

07:04.098 --> 07:05.463
<i>Please stay</i>
<i>where you are until the lights--</i>

07:06.801 --> 07:08.466
- Mr. Reese?
- I'm on it.

07:09.904 --> 07:12.070
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

07:12.072 --> 07:13.772
Excuse me.

07:13.774 --> 07:15.841
Finch, they're dry ice bombs,

07:15.843 --> 07:17.875
packed in airtight coolers
with water.

07:17.877 --> 07:19.778
And the perfect smoke screen.

07:19.780 --> 07:21.780
But who delivered them
to the museum?

07:21.782 --> 07:24.882
It could be the protestors.

07:24.884 --> 07:26.318
<i>I don't think so, Ms. Shaw.</i>

07:26.320 --> 07:27.552
I think someone's trying

07:27.554 --> 07:29.887
to make off with the Cezanne.

07:29.889 --> 07:32.624
Hey, stop!

07:37.529 --> 07:39.931
Got it, Finch.

07:55.313 --> 07:56.947
Right place, right time?

07:56.949 --> 07:59.750
I guess we're both liars, huh?

08:10.127 --> 08:13.330
Boys, you're not
gonna believe this,

08:13.332 --> 08:16.132
but I know who the thief is.

08:26.968 --> 08:29.369
I'm sorry, miss, crime scene.

08:29.371 --> 08:31.972
Officer, I was just
working this event

08:31.974 --> 08:34.374
when boom, smoke, chaos.

08:34.376 --> 08:35.909
People were running, screaming.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.711
I got swept out the door
without my bag.

08:37.712 --> 08:38.778
Sir, please--

08:38.780 --> 08:40.547
Whoa, miss, it's 1:00 AM.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.115
What can I do
to make you stop talking?

08:42.116 --> 08:43.650
Let me get my bag.

08:43.652 --> 08:45.452
I promise,
I won't touch anything

08:45.454 --> 08:49.288
or bump into any of your
NCCSI guys, I swear.

08:52.626 --> 08:54.394
I remember what table

08:54.396 --> 08:56.229
the staff put their bags under.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.264
<i>Let me know
if you find Kelly's.</i>

08:58.266 --> 08:59.598
<i>I hope in the rush</i>
<i>she forgot it,</i>

08:59.600 --> 09:01.934
<i>after she grabbed</i>
<i>that painting.</i>

09:03.203 --> 09:05.471
I'll do you one better, Finch.

09:05.473 --> 09:08.307
I got her bag and her computer.

09:08.309 --> 09:10.642
<i>Of course, she
went for the Cezanne.</i>

09:10.644 --> 09:13.279
She has good taste.

09:13.281 --> 09:15.514
I've been hunting her
for Interpol

09:15.516 --> 09:17.148
for over a year.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.852
Female, 25 to 35
of Asian ethnicity,

09:19.854 --> 09:21.854
I believe Chinese.

09:21.856 --> 09:23.655
<i>That's all
anyone can say, really.</i>

09:23.657 --> 09:26.558
<i>No one's ever gotten</i>
<i>a good look at her face.</i>

09:26.560 --> 09:29.961
I almost had her in Dubai
six months ago.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.632
I came to New York
following a passport of hers,

09:34.634 --> 09:36.534
dead end,

09:36.536 --> 09:40.138
when I got this call.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.940
She's hard to track.

09:41.942 --> 09:44.475
She uses accomplices,
vagrants that she pays off

09:44.477 --> 09:47.445
if they'll do
a little jail time.

09:47.447 --> 09:52.583
She kills them after, you see?

09:52.585 --> 09:55.019
Tell your detectives
to be ready.

09:55.021 --> 09:58.656
Anywhere this woman goes,
bodies follow.

10:11.269 --> 10:14.405
You hear that about decoys
and dead accomplices?

10:14.407 --> 10:16.373
Kelly's dangerous.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.976
The guard is still alive.

10:18.978 --> 10:23.379
And we haven't seen her
hurt anyone seriously yet.

10:23.381 --> 10:26.149
But if we received her number,

10:26.151 --> 10:28.084
it could just be
a matter of time.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.253
I already looked,
waste of time.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.221
Everything on there
supports her cover

10:32.223 --> 10:33.590
as an event planner.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.059
Shipping orders, receipts,
that kind of thing.

10:36.061 --> 10:38.061
If she ditched it,
it's worthless.

10:38.063 --> 10:39.862
Maybe it's not about
what's on the device,

10:39.864 --> 10:41.331
but rather where it's been.

10:41.333 --> 10:45.734
All portable devices
have GPS chips these days.

10:45.736 --> 10:48.338
If we're trying
to track her down,

10:48.340 --> 10:50.606
it will likely be
some place she frequents.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.042
There, down on Pearl Street.

10:53.044 --> 10:55.344
A bar called,
The Purloined Letter.

10:55.346 --> 10:57.045
That's appropriate.

10:57.047 --> 11:00.048
Let's go see who Kelly
meets for drinks.

11:05.689 --> 11:07.690
Given our proximity
and the likelihood that

11:07.692 --> 11:09.391
Kelly is in that bar,

11:09.393 --> 11:11.593
I can use software to bluejack

11:11.595 --> 11:14.729
every phone line in the place.

11:14.731 --> 11:16.865
<i>- Dude, I'm telling you--</i>
<i>- No.</i>

11:16.867 --> 11:18.633
<i>Excuse me, excuse me,
can I get a beer, please?</i>

11:18.635 --> 11:20.802
- No.
<i>- But I just can't get her out of my--</i>

11:20.804 --> 11:22.070
- No.
<i>- I got the painting.</i>

11:22.072 --> 11:23.605
Wait, I found her.

11:23.607 --> 11:25.440
It's definitely Kelly.

11:25.442 --> 11:27.909
<i>The guys I put
you in touch with,</i>

11:27.911 --> 11:29.978
<i>you get what you wanted,</i>
<i>the ice?</i>

11:29.980 --> 11:32.413
It was where it needed to be.

11:32.415 --> 11:35.349
I had to hurt a guard, Cyril.

11:35.351 --> 11:38.386
He should've stayed
out of the way.

11:41.156 --> 11:44.558
Your Cezanne.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.192
Satisfied?

11:46.194 --> 11:49.095
Only if you are, <i>milacku.</i>

11:49.097 --> 11:50.497
We're done here.

11:50.499 --> 11:53.734
Hey.

11:53.736 --> 11:57.103
I've been all around the world.
So have you.

11:57.105 --> 11:59.406
But you're far from done.

11:59.408 --> 12:01.441
My associates in Prague
are appreciative

12:01.443 --> 12:02.775
of all your work.

12:02.777 --> 12:04.644
But this next job--

12:04.646 --> 12:07.414
<i>this next job</i>
<i>is a masterpiece, Jiao.</i>

12:07.416 --> 12:10.083
You have everything
to gain from it

12:10.085 --> 12:13.819
and just as much to lose.

12:13.821 --> 12:16.956
Then I shouldn't waste
any more time talking to you.

12:35.108 --> 12:37.008
She used a key, Finch.

12:37.010 --> 12:39.945
At least we know she isn't
robbing the place.

12:49.789 --> 12:51.790
<i>I think I found
Kelly's apartment--</i>

12:51.792 --> 12:53.858
only one without a name.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.294
In the bar,
the man Kelly was meeting

12:56.296 --> 12:58.697
called her Jiao.

12:58.699 --> 13:02.233
We know that "Kelly Lin,
Event Planner" is a dead end.

13:02.235 --> 13:05.203
Let's take a look
into Jiao Lin.

13:05.205 --> 13:08.473
It seems there are
a number of sites with data

13:08.475 --> 13:10.408
relating to a former
Olympic gymnast

13:10.410 --> 13:13.877
Jiao Lin, who competed
for the Chinese National Team.

13:13.879 --> 13:17.648
<i>She won a silver medal</i>
<i>at 2000 Olympic Games.</i>

13:17.650 --> 13:19.717
China had a fine showing
in gymnastics that year.

13:19.719 --> 13:21.085
You remember those games?

13:21.087 --> 13:22.386
Sydney, wasn't it?

13:22.388 --> 13:23.654
How old was she?

13:23.656 --> 13:25.422
Barely a teenager.

13:25.424 --> 13:27.891
She was later cut
from the Chinese roster

13:27.893 --> 13:29.559
while practicing
in the Czech Republic

13:29.561 --> 13:31.394
for the World Championships.

13:31.396 --> 13:33.563
No reasons given
for her termination.

13:33.565 --> 13:35.232
So what happened
that turned Kelly

13:35.234 --> 13:38.368
from a world-class athlete
to a world-class criminal?

13:38.370 --> 13:40.070
Perhaps we should
do a little recon

13:40.072 --> 13:43.072
in Kelly's apartment
when she steps away, Mr. Reese.

13:53.184 --> 13:55.785
I'm inside Kelly's apartment,
Finch.

13:55.787 --> 13:57.920
No sign of our girl.

13:57.922 --> 14:03.126
Looks... kind of
like my place, actually.

14:03.128 --> 14:06.262
<i>Kelly's handler spoke
of a "Last job," Ms. Shaw.</i>

14:06.264 --> 14:08.131
If Kelly's likely
to hurt someone,

14:08.133 --> 14:09.866
we need to find out
when and where

14:09.868 --> 14:12.268
the job takes place
before it's too late.

14:12.270 --> 14:14.670
If I were gonna hide plans

14:14.672 --> 14:17.939
for my ultra-slick heist--

14:37.560 --> 14:41.863
Kelly's got street maps
of the city here,

14:41.865 --> 14:44.499
with an intersection marked.

14:44.501 --> 14:48.503
I'm sending you some artwork.

14:49.938 --> 14:51.673
It's a narrow side street,

14:51.675 --> 14:53.841
several subway stops
in the vicinity.

14:53.843 --> 14:55.943
It sounds to me like
a good choke point

14:55.945 --> 14:57.645
with multiple escape routes.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.647
I think we found the location
of Kelly's next job.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.850
That's not all we found.

15:02.852 --> 15:05.152
I've got research here,

15:05.154 --> 15:08.055
<i>something about a Bible--</i>
<i>the Gutenberg Bible?</i>

15:08.057 --> 15:09.790
The Gutenberg Bible?

15:09.792 --> 15:11.625
<i>It's on a world tour.</i>

15:11.627 --> 15:13.994
<i>It's leaving New York tomorrow</i>
<i>for Venice, Italy.</i>

15:13.996 --> 15:16.764
<i>It's in transit right now.</i>

15:43.791 --> 15:45.658
Spike strip.

15:45.660 --> 15:48.661
Finch, I think Kelly's about
to do something really violent.

15:55.034 --> 15:57.870
You don't know
what you're doing.

15:57.872 --> 15:59.204
I guess I was
in the right place

15:59.206 --> 16:01.674
at the right time again.

16:12.051 --> 16:13.652
I needed to stop them.

16:13.654 --> 16:16.155
Now it's too late.

16:24.097 --> 16:25.930
Answer it.

16:30.002 --> 16:31.169
Cyril.

16:31.171 --> 16:32.570
How did it go?

16:32.572 --> 16:34.572
I didn't get it.

16:35.909 --> 16:37.041
Excuse me. For a moment,
I thought you said

16:37.043 --> 16:38.242
you didn't get it.

16:38.244 --> 16:41.446
I didn't get the Bible, Cyril.

16:41.448 --> 16:43.314
But I still can.

16:43.316 --> 16:45.082
I'll think of something.

16:45.084 --> 16:46.684
<i>Do you have any idea</i>
<i>what's at stake,</i>

16:46.686 --> 16:48.752
how much money
we're talking about?

16:48.754 --> 16:50.521
<i>My associates in Prague</i>
<i>don't take kindly</i>

16:50.523 --> 16:52.356
<i>to people who welch</i>
<i>on their debt.</i>

16:52.358 --> 16:55.359
Let me remind you.

17:06.037 --> 17:08.439
Mommy, is that you?

17:10.141 --> 17:12.542
It's me, Kai.

17:12.545 --> 17:15.111
It's me, baby.

17:16.548 --> 17:20.817
Did I just hear
the word "Mommy"?

17:20.819 --> 17:23.819
Oh, we've made
a terrible mistake.

17:36.129 --> 17:37.429
I don't know why you had

17:37.431 --> 17:39.731
to make it so hard on yourself.

17:43.503 --> 17:45.904
Got a feisty one here, Finch.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.406
You two play nice.

17:48.408 --> 17:52.677
I'm just gonna
sit over here with my gun.

17:52.679 --> 17:54.946
Ms. Lin, you're not
going to believe me,

17:54.948 --> 17:56.715
but I'm someone
who helps people.

17:56.717 --> 17:58.750
Like you helped my daughter.

17:58.752 --> 18:02.586
I know a lot about you,
your Olympic career.

18:02.588 --> 18:04.055
You don't know anything.

18:04.057 --> 18:07.558
I'd like to know more,
if you'd permit.

18:08.927 --> 18:10.694
You don't seem to commit crimes

18:10.696 --> 18:12.930
of your own volition.

18:12.932 --> 18:15.900
But you also don't seem
to mind doing it, either.

18:15.902 --> 18:19.036
I'm guessing it's
been a while, if ever,

18:19.038 --> 18:22.105
since you were desperate
or hungry.

18:22.107 --> 18:25.543
I hid the pregnancy
as long as I could.

18:25.545 --> 18:28.111
When I started to show,
I knew it was all over.

18:28.113 --> 18:32.449
Made my way to Europe--
no money, no skills.

18:32.451 --> 18:35.485
Gymnastics wouldn't
feed my baby.

18:35.487 --> 18:38.555
I pawned my silver medal
for the medical care

18:38.557 --> 18:40.390
to give birth.

18:40.392 --> 18:42.159
Then I broke back
into the same pawn shop

18:42.161 --> 18:44.661
and stole a watch.

18:44.663 --> 18:46.896
I stole to feed my newborn.

18:46.898 --> 18:49.732
I didn't know it was a front
for criminals.

18:49.734 --> 18:51.000
And they tracked you down?

18:51.002 --> 18:52.869
They wanted me to pay my debt,

18:52.871 --> 18:54.571
and I guess they had an opening

18:54.573 --> 18:57.740
on their team for a thief.

18:57.742 --> 18:58.808
You could've said no.

18:58.810 --> 19:00.810
They took Kai from me.

19:00.812 --> 19:02.645
I didn't have a choice.

19:02.647 --> 19:05.048
They promised to send her

19:05.050 --> 19:06.848
just as soon
as the work was done.

19:06.850 --> 19:09.351
And what about
the people you killed?

19:09.353 --> 19:10.819
What are you talking about?

19:10.821 --> 19:12.788
There's an Interpol agent
close on your trail.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.423
He seems to think that
you've left behind

19:14.425 --> 19:17.460
quite a body count.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.364
Cyril--
it had to have been.

19:23.366 --> 19:26.367
He-- he hires those people--

19:26.369 --> 19:28.604
<i>the decoys, vagrants.</i>

19:28.606 --> 19:30.639
He must take care of them

19:30.641 --> 19:34.342
after I finish a job
and leave town.

19:34.344 --> 19:36.645
He's a monster.

19:36.647 --> 19:41.116
I didn't know anyone
had been hurt, I swear.

19:41.118 --> 19:42.783
And the Bible was
the last thing

19:42.785 --> 19:44.152
you needed to get for them?

19:44.154 --> 19:45.853
It's too late.

19:45.855 --> 19:47.355
I had to grab it in transit.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.056
It's protected now.

19:49.058 --> 19:52.660
Outfit called
Symmetric Security Solutions.

19:52.662 --> 19:54.829
Cyril and his partners
aren't patient men,

19:54.831 --> 19:56.964
and I don't know what
they'll do to Kai.

19:56.966 --> 19:59.033
Symmetric Security
is based in the UK,

19:59.035 --> 20:00.635
but they have
a corporate office here.

20:00.637 --> 20:02.036
That's where they took it,
you're sure?

20:02.038 --> 20:03.804
I'm sure.
It's downtown.

20:03.806 --> 20:06.240
I've seen it,
the building's a fortress.

20:06.242 --> 20:07.808
Finch, what are you doing?

20:07.810 --> 20:09.476
Just a little research,

20:09.478 --> 20:11.778
seeing how accessible
Symmetric's building is.

20:11.780 --> 20:12.979
Have you considered the option

20:12.981 --> 20:15.115
that we could
go rescue the girl?

20:15.117 --> 20:16.816
Kai is halfway
around the world, Ms. Shaw.

20:16.818 --> 20:18.218
How long would that take?

20:18.220 --> 20:19.586
A while, but--

20:19.588 --> 20:21.054
And what if she doesn't
have a while?

20:21.056 --> 20:23.423
I think we have
only one option here.

20:23.425 --> 20:25.725
We need to
get the Bible ourselves.

20:25.727 --> 20:28.594
Fine...
I'll cut the thief loose.

20:29.797 --> 20:32.732
I already cut myself loose.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.742
<i>Okay, Symmetric
Security Solutions.</i>

20:42.744 --> 20:44.877
We need to know who designed

20:44.879 --> 20:46.579
the building and their offices.

20:46.581 --> 20:48.181
We'll need someone
to help secure

20:48.183 --> 20:49.782
architectural designs,

20:49.784 --> 20:51.750
steal them if we have to,

20:51.752 --> 20:53.586
then develop our operation--

20:53.588 --> 20:54.920
Or just call someone
from the NYPD

20:54.922 --> 20:56.355
with friends in security,

20:56.357 --> 20:57.956
who can get you
those kinds of things.

20:57.958 --> 21:01.259
Yeah, that's right,
I know people.

21:01.261 --> 21:05.030
Hey, this is a nice place.

21:05.032 --> 21:08.300
<i>Symmetric Security's offices</i>
<i>occupy the top five floors</i>

21:08.302 --> 21:11.103
of a 70-story tower
in the financial district.

21:11.105 --> 21:13.271
At precisely 1800 hours,

21:13.273 --> 21:15.207
business operations cease,

21:15.209 --> 21:17.409
whereupon all stair
and elevator traffic

21:17.411 --> 21:21.213
is locked out, leaving
a lone service elevator

21:21.215 --> 21:23.248
in the secured parking garage

21:23.250 --> 21:25.350
as the only way to get
to the upper floors.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.051
From the inside.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.987
This is not your average
security company.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.155
When it comes to thieves,

21:31.157 --> 21:32.990
their motto
is "Deter or eliminate."

21:32.992 --> 21:34.592
The Symmetric floor
is protected

21:34.594 --> 21:36.828
by armed guards and
panoramic hemisphere cameras

21:36.830 --> 21:39.030
with 360-degree coverage.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.298
The Bible will be held
on the 70th floor,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.734
in one of six secure rooms

21:42.736 --> 21:44.836
where they keep
high-value items.

21:44.838 --> 21:46.604
Sadly, there's no way
to know which room

21:46.606 --> 21:48.139
they'll hold our item.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.774
Whatever the room,
it's certain to be guarded

21:49.776 --> 21:52.243
by a biometric fingerprint scan

21:52.245 --> 21:54.510
which can detect the prints
on all five fingertips

21:54.512 --> 21:56.579
and also the user's body heat.

21:56.581 --> 21:59.349
Inside the rooms,
there are IR motion sensors

21:59.351 --> 22:01.184
and an 8-foot-tall cage,

22:01.186 --> 22:04.054
alarmed and electrified,
that surrounds the object.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.289
The cages themselves
have perimeter sensors

22:06.291 --> 22:08.324
that can detect movement
within 20 feet.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.728
Just your average
walk in the park.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.162
They're the best
in the business.

22:13.164 --> 22:14.196
<i>Whoever's running this company</i>

22:14.198 --> 22:15.698
<i>is on top of their game.</i>

22:15.700 --> 22:18.268
And no doubt
love their reputation.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.203
<i>I think it's time I met
with someone at Symmetric.</i>

22:26.310 --> 22:27.676
Okay.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.645
This is Agent Bouchard
speaking.

22:29.647 --> 22:31.213
<i>This is Detective
Lionel Fusco with the NYPD</i>

22:31.215 --> 22:32.547
<i>down here at</i>
<i>the Eighth Precinct.</i>

22:32.549 --> 22:34.049
I was in the village
running down a lead

22:34.051 --> 22:36.652
on some stolen property
for a larceny case.

22:36.654 --> 22:38.654
I saw someone who
matched the description

22:38.656 --> 22:40.389
of an Interpol notice
you have up.

22:40.391 --> 22:44.959
Chinese woman,
late 20s, early 30s.

22:44.961 --> 22:47.529
You hunting down a thief
or something?

22:47.531 --> 22:50.699
I am, Detective.
What do you need from me?

22:50.701 --> 22:53.669
Well, uh, you know,
I'm stretched a little thin.

22:53.671 --> 22:54.836
But if you wanted, you could go

22:54.838 --> 22:56.070
sit on the apartment.

22:56.072 --> 22:57.539
<i>If you get anything juicy,</i>

22:57.541 --> 22:58.973
<i>you could slip it</i>
<i>back to me here.</i>

22:58.975 --> 23:01.176
Uh, yes.
<i>Merci.</i>

23:01.178 --> 23:04.179
What is the address?

23:46.687 --> 23:48.788
I got a report of a stolen car
in the area.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.357
The description
matches this one.

23:50.359 --> 23:51.624
That's impossible.

23:51.626 --> 23:52.892
This car belongs to

23:52.894 --> 23:54.260
the security company
I work for.

23:54.262 --> 23:55.928
I'm the supervisor.

23:55.930 --> 23:58.931
Here, check it out.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.774
Based on the prints
I'm getting,

24:08.776 --> 24:11.043
I can tell this guy doesn't
wash his hands very much.

24:11.045 --> 24:13.746
That's informative, Detective.

24:13.748 --> 24:18.450
I'll have a nice set
of latent prints in a few.

24:18.452 --> 24:19.919
Not bad, Lionel.

24:19.921 --> 24:22.254
Finch, you find anything else
about Cyril

24:22.256 --> 24:24.055
or the Czechs holding the girl?

24:24.057 --> 24:25.591
Speculation, mostly.

24:25.593 --> 24:27.559
This syndicate
covers their tracks.

24:27.561 --> 24:29.661
Based on theft records
and news articles,

24:29.663 --> 24:32.631
I believe they're part
of an extortion scheme

24:32.633 --> 24:34.800
that targets culturally
significant artifacts

24:34.802 --> 24:37.469
and forces Kelly to steal them.

24:37.471 --> 24:39.804
Then they sell them
to the highest bidder

24:39.806 --> 24:41.239
or back to the owner.

24:41.241 --> 24:42.974
That's a guaranteed market.

24:42.976 --> 24:45.277
The Saudi Royal family
is no doubt interested

24:45.279 --> 24:46.444
in a jeweled dagger

24:46.446 --> 24:48.346
belonging to an ancestor.

24:48.348 --> 24:49.981
And the administration
of the Louvre

24:49.983 --> 24:51.482
might pay handsomely
under the table

24:51.484 --> 24:52.750
to recover an artwork

24:52.752 --> 24:54.485
stolen from them
in the first place.

24:54.487 --> 24:57.021
<i>Do we think we can trust her?
Kelly?</i>

24:57.023 --> 24:58.856
To pull off this last job?

24:58.858 --> 25:00.291
I hear ya, Mr. Reese,

25:00.293 --> 25:02.293
but we don't have
another alternative.

25:02.295 --> 25:04.161
And just because we didn't
receive Kai's number

25:04.163 --> 25:06.263
doesn't mean we can't
protect her too.

25:06.265 --> 25:08.499
Our plan is to get the book
and save the girl.

25:08.501 --> 25:09.767
<i>What happens if the Czechs</i>
<i>pull out</i>

25:09.769 --> 25:10.968
<i>on their end of things?</i>

25:10.970 --> 25:13.837
Working on that, Mr. Reese.

25:22.047 --> 25:24.014
Pardon.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.286
I finally found you.

25:30.288 --> 25:32.388
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:32.390 --> 25:34.991
Who are you?

25:34.993 --> 25:38.528
We both know exactly
who each other are.

25:38.530 --> 25:40.831
You were good,
I'll give you that.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.666
They laughed at me
when I told them

25:42.668 --> 25:45.868
who I was after, at Interpol.

25:47.838 --> 25:51.341
I've bagged so many thieves
in so many countries,

25:51.343 --> 25:55.345
but you, I thought
I'd chase you forever.

25:57.214 --> 25:58.914
You can't prove anything.

25:58.916 --> 26:00.850
And yet, here we are.

26:00.852 --> 26:03.385
Trust me.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.420
Whatever you cook up next,

26:05.422 --> 26:07.490
I'll be right behind you

26:07.492 --> 26:10.493
with a SWAT team
and a set of shackles.

26:16.833 --> 26:19.667
Hook, line, and sinker.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.008
This is Supervisor Farrow.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.542
What can I do for you,
Agent Bouchard?

26:27.544 --> 26:29.244
I have reason to believe
an attempt will be made

26:29.246 --> 26:32.214
on an item at your location,
a very old book.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.516
A Bible.
You have to believe me.

26:34.518 --> 26:36.050
Your credentials
have been authenticated,

26:36.052 --> 26:37.485
only reason we're talking.

26:37.487 --> 26:38.720
What do you think we should do?

26:38.722 --> 26:41.656
Take the threat
very, very seriously.

26:41.658 --> 26:44.125
<i>We'll initiate
default security measure 202,</i>

26:44.127 --> 26:45.693
<i>which automatically</i>
<i>moves an object</i>

26:45.695 --> 26:47.762
<i>to the central room</i>
<i>of our secure floor</i>

26:47.764 --> 26:49.063
<i>for safer keeping.</i>

26:49.065 --> 26:50.631
<i>Jackpot, Finch.</i>

26:50.633 --> 26:52.933
You can tell everyone we have
an exact location

26:52.935 --> 26:54.335
for the Bible now.

26:54.337 --> 26:57.004
Then it's time to go to work.

27:16.554 --> 27:18.322
<i>Everything's
in place, Mr. Reese.</i>

27:18.324 --> 27:20.124
<i>We just need our man</i>
<i>on the inside.</i>

27:20.126 --> 27:21.692
<i>I'm on it.</i>

27:21.694 --> 27:23.361
<i>Let's just say I've worked</i>

27:23.363 --> 27:26.130
<i>in high-level security</i>
<i>for the past 15 years.</i>

27:26.132 --> 27:29.566
Do you know what a KN2
krytron switch tube is?

27:29.568 --> 27:33.837
For argument's sake,
let's say that I don't.

27:33.839 --> 27:36.473
But the United States government
requires me to say

27:36.475 --> 27:38.275
that transportation
of any contraband

27:38.277 --> 27:39.476
or illegal substance--

27:39.478 --> 27:41.111
Drop the fine print, pal.

27:41.113 --> 27:42.446
From what I hear,
there hasn't been

27:42.448 --> 27:45.115
a transport invented
that your company

27:45.117 --> 27:47.284
Symmetric Security
cannot handle.

27:47.286 --> 27:50.253
Especially when money
is no object.

27:52.523 --> 27:55.324
A krytron is a cold-cathode
gas tube,

27:55.326 --> 27:58.528
commonly used in triggers
on nuclear weapons.

27:58.530 --> 28:02.598
And if our company never
looks inside the transport,

28:02.600 --> 28:06.569
we're never made aware
of any illegal activity.

28:11.574 --> 28:14.810
Why don't I buy us
another drink?

28:19.649 --> 28:21.883
Okay, let's make it

28:21.885 --> 28:24.987
just a little warmer
around there.

28:46.542 --> 28:50.244
Your case will be safer here
than Fort Knox, Mr. Wiley.

28:52.114 --> 28:53.747
Mr. Zappo, it's after hours.

28:53.749 --> 28:55.183
And I'm a property
resource manager

28:55.185 --> 28:57.485
with a high-value client
standing beside me.

28:57.487 --> 28:59.620
So you'll stand aside.

28:59.622 --> 29:02.623
Well, you'll need to sign in.

29:15.269 --> 29:17.804
Do you really
have nuclear triggers

29:17.806 --> 29:19.272
in that briefcase?

29:19.274 --> 29:21.074
No.

29:24.612 --> 29:27.414
I'm in, Finch.

29:52.740 --> 29:54.440
Can someone kill those alarms?

29:59.746 --> 30:01.514
Reset the alarms.

30:01.516 --> 30:02.948
And someone call the NYPD

30:02.950 --> 30:05.951
to come and collect our friend.

30:14.293 --> 30:16.394
<i>Ms. Shaw, I
believe that's your cue.</i>

30:21.834 --> 30:25.770
<i>You have 45 seconds
until the alarms reset.</i>

30:34.213 --> 30:35.713
Garage, there's a 5-0
at the gate,

30:35.715 --> 30:37.082
here for the prisoner.

30:37.084 --> 30:39.184
He said he was in the area.

30:47.525 --> 30:48.726
This the guy?

30:48.728 --> 30:51.629
He's all yours.

30:51.631 --> 30:53.330
They fell for it.

30:53.332 --> 30:54.699
Where to next?

30:54.701 --> 30:57.234
Take me to JFK,
private charter terminal.

30:57.236 --> 30:59.136
I should start charging fares.

31:04.242 --> 31:05.909
<i>Oh, don't forget
to give each finger</i>

31:05.911 --> 31:08.545
<i>a good lick</i>
<i>before you scan them.</i>

31:08.547 --> 31:09.980
Excuse me?

31:09.982 --> 31:11.515
Saliva will simulate sweat

31:11.517 --> 31:13.316
and fake out
the body heat feature.

31:23.406 --> 31:24.943
_

31:28.398 --> 31:30.233
<i>Ms. Shaw, I
created a three-minute</i>

31:30.235 --> 31:31.934
<i>surveillance loop</i>
<i>on the camera feed.</i>

31:31.936 --> 31:33.369
<i>The rest is up to you.</i>

31:33.371 --> 31:35.070
Your guy is sure
his computer trick

31:35.072 --> 31:37.173
killed the motion sensors?

31:37.175 --> 31:39.875
Yeah.

31:39.877 --> 31:42.478
Something about turning up
ambient air temperature

31:42.480 --> 31:44.213
to match our skin temperatures.

31:44.215 --> 31:47.549
Let's hope he's right.

31:47.551 --> 31:50.585
Well, he's always right.

31:50.587 --> 31:52.554
Damn, it's hot in here.

31:55.644 --> 31:57.015
_

32:01.064 --> 32:03.231
Agent Bouchard, I see you
took me up on the offer.

32:03.233 --> 32:04.499
Thank you for
letting me check in.

32:04.501 --> 32:05.600
Would it be possible for me

32:05.602 --> 32:07.101
to actually see the Bible?

32:07.103 --> 32:08.570
No need.
We already had someone

32:08.572 --> 32:09.804
make a run at the book tonight.

32:09.806 --> 32:11.206
Did you arrest her?

32:11.208 --> 32:13.441
It was a guy.
A big guy.

32:13.443 --> 32:15.210
The thief Interpol
is after is a woman,

32:15.212 --> 32:16.978
I'm sure of it--

32:16.980 --> 32:18.613
a woman who uses male decoys.

32:18.615 --> 32:21.049
Look, Frenchie, we handled it.

32:21.051 --> 32:23.284
I promise.
Everything's under control.

32:56.317 --> 32:58.719
My hands are sweating.

32:58.721 --> 33:00.453
Well, make them stop.

33:01.690 --> 33:03.256
Farrow, have you been up
on the 70th

33:03.258 --> 33:05.125
- since we nailed that guy?
- What?

33:05.127 --> 33:07.427
No, I've been here with you
the entire time since.

33:07.429 --> 33:09.596
Well, the computer's saying
your fingerprints were used

33:09.598 --> 33:13.165
three minutes ago to open
a secure room up there.

33:13.167 --> 33:15.535
All security teams,
converge on the 70th floor.

33:15.537 --> 33:18.471
This is not a drill!
Let's go!

34:22.000 --> 34:25.902
We're too late.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.699
<i>I liaised with the NYPD.</i>

34:39.701 --> 34:42.335
They're using every
able resource to track.

34:42.337 --> 34:44.937
Yes, sir, <i>oui.</i>

34:44.938 --> 34:46.871
I'll be on a plane tonight.

34:46.873 --> 34:50.143
Hang up the phone
and get in the car.

35:00.521 --> 35:02.521
We didn't steal the Bible,
Agent Bouchard,

35:02.523 --> 35:05.190
we merely borrowed it...
a bit.

35:11.531 --> 35:14.066
Services rendered.

35:14.068 --> 35:16.535
No more jobs.

35:18.837 --> 35:21.306
Did you hear me, Cyril?

35:21.308 --> 35:23.808
I'm out.

35:30.049 --> 35:31.983
My debt is paid

35:31.985 --> 35:35.219
to you and your Prague friends.

35:35.221 --> 35:37.488
I want my daughter.

35:37.490 --> 35:40.324
<i>I'm done with this life.</i>

35:40.326 --> 35:41.993
<i>And I'm done with you.</i>

35:41.995 --> 35:44.162
<i>You've brought us millions</i>

35:44.164 --> 35:47.765
<i>over the years, Jiao,</i>
<i>tens of millions.</i>

35:47.767 --> 35:50.168
Why end such a good thing?

35:50.170 --> 35:53.571
You see, you stop
working for us

35:53.573 --> 35:55.839
when I say you do.

35:55.841 --> 35:58.509
And if you ever
try to run on me,

35:58.511 --> 36:00.544
I'll get my money's worth,

36:00.546 --> 36:02.946
out of you or
out of your daughter.

36:02.948 --> 36:04.615
Don't you touch her.

36:04.617 --> 36:06.883
<i>Kai? She's in a luxury spa</i>

36:06.885 --> 36:08.451
<i>compared to where</i>
<i>I could send her.</i>

36:08.453 --> 36:10.553
Do you want to know?

36:11.823 --> 36:13.123
Do what you must, but I thought

36:13.125 --> 36:16.126
you should hear the truth.

36:20.733 --> 36:22.465
This is Agent Bouchard,

36:22.467 --> 36:24.734
Interpol Special Crimes
Directorate.

36:24.736 --> 36:28.438
I need to speak
with my NYPD liaison.

36:28.440 --> 36:31.607
How about a little reminder?

36:31.609 --> 36:33.843
Can you just let her be, Cyril?

36:33.845 --> 36:36.346
You have to realize,
you're property

36:36.348 --> 36:38.614
and your daughter's property.

36:38.616 --> 36:40.716
And you will be,
as long as--

36:42.353 --> 36:43.586
What the hell is going on?

36:55.131 --> 36:58.434
Slight change of plans, Cyril.

36:58.436 --> 37:01.437
Kai, I'm a friend
of your mother's.

37:01.439 --> 37:03.439
I'm here to take you home.

37:03.441 --> 37:05.607
<i>You're safe now.</i>

37:12.549 --> 37:14.816
Who was that?
In the video?

37:14.818 --> 37:16.017
A friend.

37:16.019 --> 37:18.887
I wanted to kill you
a long time ago.

37:18.889 --> 37:21.056
But they said
you were too useful.

37:21.058 --> 37:22.323
Not anymore!

37:25.662 --> 37:28.162
NYPD!
Down on the ground!

37:29.231 --> 37:30.664
Hands up!

37:30.666 --> 37:32.733
Hey, Officer, I got this one.

37:45.547 --> 37:48.649
I used to hate those colors.

37:48.651 --> 37:51.251
It usually meant
I needed to run.

37:51.253 --> 37:53.520
Well, Kelly can't run anymore.

37:53.522 --> 37:56.090
What do you think happens next?

37:56.092 --> 37:57.791
Mr. Reese will be
bringing Kai

37:57.793 --> 37:59.493
back safely to the US

37:59.495 --> 38:01.662
and a very wealthy alias
of mine is sponsoring

38:01.664 --> 38:04.431
her citizenship
to help speed things along.

38:04.433 --> 38:06.133
And Kelly?

38:06.135 --> 38:08.135
Kelly broke the law,
repeatedly.

38:08.137 --> 38:09.802
And to end this situation,
we had to

38:09.804 --> 38:11.304
bring in Agent Bouchard.

38:11.306 --> 38:13.273
So for better or worse,

38:13.275 --> 38:16.610
her fate is in his hands now.

38:25.986 --> 38:28.287
You got five minutes.

38:35.828 --> 38:38.697
Unfortunately, since you
are a legal US citizen,

38:38.699 --> 38:40.332
I can't do what I really want

38:40.334 --> 38:43.702
and extradite you
back to Europe.

38:43.704 --> 38:46.472
And there is so much
I have you on.

38:46.474 --> 38:50.008
40 counts of art
and antiquities theft,

38:50.010 --> 38:54.179
and illicit trafficking
in 20 countries.

38:54.181 --> 38:56.048
I could put you away
for a lifetime

38:56.050 --> 38:58.249
on half the continents
in the world,

38:58.251 --> 38:59.818
regardless of the duress

38:59.820 --> 39:02.520
you were under at the time.

39:02.522 --> 39:05.423
I'm a hero with Interpol now.

39:05.425 --> 39:09.194
I recovered the Bible
and took down a cell

39:09.196 --> 39:11.429
of Czech extortionists
in Prague.

39:11.431 --> 39:14.399
Don't know how I did that,
but I'll take credit.

39:16.669 --> 39:19.671
I couldn't do anything wrong
now if I tried.

39:21.307 --> 39:23.874
I always thought
it was a shame.

39:23.876 --> 39:25.876
My life of crime?

39:25.878 --> 39:28.979
No.

39:28.981 --> 39:31.949
Your life before that.

39:36.021 --> 39:39.023
I always thought
you deserved the gold.

39:58.743 --> 40:00.744
Please, thank your friends
for helping

40:00.746 --> 40:02.345
to get Kai to safety.

40:02.347 --> 40:03.880
You're both safe

40:03.882 --> 40:06.216
now that Cyril and his thugs
ended up in jail...

40:06.218 --> 40:09.219
or the Emergency Room.

40:12.289 --> 40:15.057
I wonder if I'll make it
in the real world.

40:15.059 --> 40:17.960
The only thing I was good at
was gymnastics

40:17.962 --> 40:19.328
and stealing.

40:19.330 --> 40:20.896
Mm.

40:20.898 --> 40:23.432
The only thing I was good at
was killing people,

40:23.434 --> 40:26.435
but I'm workin' on it.

40:28.972 --> 40:32.107
How about you just try
being a mom?

40:36.712 --> 40:39.081
Oh, my--

40:39.083 --> 40:41.616
- Kai!
- Mommy!

40:41.618 --> 40:45.353
Oh, my God, my baby.

40:48.023 --> 40:50.158
I missed you so much.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.793
How are you?
Are you okay?

40:56.633 --> 40:58.266
We're gonna go home.

40:58.268 --> 41:00.669
Yes, we are.

41:06.275 --> 41:09.977
How about Fort Knox?

41:09.979 --> 41:12.513
Think we could take Fort Knox?

41:12.515 --> 41:15.149
You thinking about doing this
professionally, Lionel?

41:15.151 --> 41:17.251
- I mean, you never know.
- I don't know, Detective.

41:17.253 --> 41:19.287
Gold is difficult
to move efficiently

41:19.289 --> 41:21.288
and not worth its weight
in untrustworthy markets.

41:21.290 --> 41:23.357
Now diamonds--

41:23.359 --> 41:27.194
All I'm saying is,
we all make a pretty good team.

41:37.705 --> 41:41.041
There's one teammate missing.

41:47.748 --> 41:51.184
How about the crown jewels?

42:01.241 --> 42:04.221
