(Man): I'm looking
for Ana Paole.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.081
No, she doesn't live
here anymore.

02:38.082 --> 02:40.208
Do you know
where I can find her?

04:50.880 --> 04:52.803
(fly buzzing)

04:54.160 --> 04:57.403
Ana, why didn't you clean up?

05:09.680 --> 05:10.999
Aha?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.002
Did you hear me?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.329
Aha?

05:17.920 --> 05:19.559
JESUS.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.484
I can't believe you're still
mad, this is stupid.

<i>(Ana): I'm here,

Aha!

06:11.200 --> 06:14.044
What... what did you do?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.119
I'm sorry.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.088
I had to.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.848

07:16.000 --> 07:19.159
Hey, that's my spot.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.162
Move your ass.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.559
What's your problem?

07:31.560 --> 07:34.719
You don't wanna
make new friends?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.768
(Man): He's higher than you.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.605
Pussy.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.564
I told you to move,
motherfucker.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.321
(Man #2): Bro,
I think he's deaf.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.959
Move.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.531
Or I'm taking your eye.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.969
What's stopping you?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.600

09:17.280 --> 09:19.919
Who the fuck are you?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.888
You're gonna kill him.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.282
Just keep moving.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.444
(groans)

09:52.760 --> 09:54.079
Wait!

09:54.080 --> 09:55.959
Officer!

09:55.960 --> 09:58.770
Officer! Stop! Here.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.519
What's the matter, kid?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.488
Everything alright?

10:06.080 --> 10:08.048
(laughing)

10:10.440 --> 10:12.404
(siren wailing)
Oh, fuck. I'm outta here.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.846
- You handle this.
- Stop! Nobody move!

10:21.960 --> 10:23.724
What the fuck is going on here?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.759
He attacked me.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.649
It was self-defense.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.410
He attacked you?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.764
I'm telling the truth.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.848
You goddamn liar!

10:41.600 --> 10:44.683
- Who is he?
- I don't know, some drifter.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.559
Jesus, he's not breathing.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.210
Fuck him.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.404
What the hell are you
waiting for, dumb-ass?

10:58.405 --> 11:00.084
Grab him before
somebody sees us.

11:00.085 --> 11:01.161
Move!

11:48.200 --> 11:50.123
Get the shovel.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.241
<i>(Police radio):
Lieutenant, we got a 16-14</i>

12:05.242 --> 12:07.125
<i>in progress on
Taylor and Seasons.</i>

12:07.126 --> 12:08.610
<i>We need your assistance.</i>

12:08.611 --> 12:11.679
Send Robinson.
He should be in that area.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.126
<i>Negative, lieutenant.
Robinson is off duty, sir.</i>

12:16.320 --> 12:18.399
Okay, I'm on my way-

12:18.400 --> 12:19.481
Shit.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.442
Cover him up.
I'll finish it later.

12:25.443 --> 12:26.999
I can take care of it.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.651
(Cop): You can't even
wipe your own ass.

12:29.652 --> 12:31.290
Go home, now.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.690
Copy that.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.890
(dramatic music)

13:11.120 --> 13:14.124
(instrumental music)

13:38.920 --> 13:40.729
(dog barking)

13:53.160 --> 13:55.401
Here, take my jacket.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.359
Ma. Wake up, ma!

14:04.360 --> 14:05.879
- Shh.
- Ma!

14:05.880 --> 14:08.719
Leave me alone,
I just got home.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.722
- I need you to come.
- Later.

14:10.723 --> 14:13.279
Mom, it's an emergency!

14:13.280 --> 14:15.328
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

14:15.329 --> 14:18.079
He came to the house
asking about Ana.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.919
Ana?

14:19.920 --> 14:22.127
Yeah, then he was
stabbed at the park.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.119
And you brought him here?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.925
You have to take him
to the hospital.

14:25.926 --> 14:28.002
- I can't treat him here.
- I can't.

14:28.003 --> 14:29.519
There was a cop there.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.439
And he was the one
trying to hide his body.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.283
If I take him to the hospital,
he's gonna find him.

14:33.284 --> 14:36.006
I don't wanna have
anything to do with the police.

14:36.007 --> 14:37.602
Please, Mom,
just do what you can

14:37.603 --> 14:39.250
and I'll get him
out of here soon.

14:39.251 --> 14:42.483
- I promise.
- Oh, God.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.768
Okay, just get me
the first-aid kit.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.000
Alright.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.359
No, don't... don't touch me.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.805
I'm sick.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.768
Don't touch my blood.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.728
Here, Mom.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.519
(Martin grunts)

15:14.520 --> 15:16.759
Let me die.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.683
Or I'll kill you both.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.559
Mom.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.039
Why the hell would
you bring him here?

15:26.040 --> 15:27.559
I'm sorry.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.291
You should have left him
where you found him.

15:30.292 --> 15:33.159
What where you thinking?
You idiot!

15:33.160 --> 15:34.479
(sighs)

15:34.480 --> 15:36.847
You're right.
I'll take him to the hospital.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.047
Don't! Not yet.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.039
Wait until it's dark.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.008
Otherwise someone's
gonna see you.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.530
(police radio chatter)

15:57.400 --> 16:00.324
(eerie music)

16:27.640 --> 16:29.608
Son of a bitch.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.325
(groaning)

16:48.720 --> 16:50.599
Where the fuck am I?

16:50.600 --> 16:53.439
It's okay, you're safe.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.647
I don't need your fucking help.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.968
I... brought you something.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.239
Here. Drink.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.679
Come on. Drink.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.559
No!

17:07.560 --> 17:09.759
Leave me alone...

17:09.760 --> 17:12.240
You deaf motherfucker.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.728
(cat meowing)

17:33.480 --> 17:34.891
Caleb.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.121
That tagger who
saw you last night,

17:39.122 --> 17:40.719
do you know him?

17:40.720 --> 17:41.881
Why?

17:44.240 --> 17:46.208
Do you know him or not?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.199
Fuck.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.679
What did he do?

17:50.680 --> 17:54.199
He followed us,
and he took your friend.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.727
- Motherfucker! I'm gonna...
- You're not doing shit!

17:57.728 --> 18:00.039
You'll only fuck it up worse!

18:00.040 --> 18:02.008
Do you hear me?

18:05.880 --> 18:08.599
What's this?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.759
Breakfast.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.081
You keep this shit
out of my house.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.368
What's the big deal?

18:17.800 --> 18:20.280
It's not like Mom can say
anything anymore.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.963
Wait here until I come back.
Goddamn idiot.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.281
(indistinct chatter on TV)

18:54.160 --> 18:56.159

Hi, Mom.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.959

19:01.960 --> 19:03.883
<i>Nobody heard anything

19:03.884 --> 19:06.039
<i>I think we're okay.</i>

Eva?

What?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.479
(sniffles)

19:23.480 --> 19:25.687
What am I gonna do with you?

19:27.680 --> 19:29.682
Next time you're out.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.970
I won't allow you
to fuck it all up again!

19:34.440 --> 19:36.602
I just can't.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.048
I thought you were
done with this shit!

19:39.760 --> 19:41.967
- It was just this once...
- Save it!

19:45.240 --> 19:48.050
You heard me.
Next time you're out!

19:53.520 --> 19:54.806
(telephone ringing)

20:02.800 --> 20:05.246
- Morning, Harris!
- Uh, hey, lieutenant!

20:08.200 --> 20:10.771
How's everything
in our humble little town?

20:10.772 --> 20:12.199
Peaceful.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.679
Been a little fender bender
over on Fourth and Burwash

20:14.680 --> 20:17.399
but nobody got hurt, thank God.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.765
Nothin' else?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.044
No.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.323
Nothing last night?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.086
No.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.561
At least not according
to Russell's report.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.049
Why, did you heard something?

20:33.050 --> 20:36.159
No, just checkin'. Thank you.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.045
Oh, the chief called
from Black River.

20:38.046 --> 20:40.766
He said he's gonna stay out
there a couple more days.

20:40.767 --> 20:43.124
Thank God his wife's surgery
went so well, huh?

20:43.125 --> 20:44.446
Oh, good, excellent.

20:44.447 --> 20:46.329
Give him my best
if he calls again.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.321
Yeah.

Peter!

21:02.640 --> 21:05.279

There's someone outside!

21:44.806 --> 21:46.802
<i>(Caleb): Come on out,
you little faggot!</i>

21:51.600 --> 21:54.319
- What do you want?
- We want you.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.839
<i>Fucking rat!</i>

21:55.840 --> 21:58.566
<i>Get your ass out here, or else
we're comin' in for you!</i>

21:58.567 --> 22:00.528
I'm calling the police!
Go away!

22:00.529 --> 22:02.319
Go ahead, bitch, do it.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.559
And I'll burn your house down.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.924
No, no, no, no, no.
You'll only make it worse.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.126
I'll take care of it.

22:08.127 --> 22:11.319
If you're not out here in 10...

Peter, they're gonna
kill you! Don't go!

- Don't, Peter.

22:32.169 --> 22:33.359

22:33.360 --> 22:35.727
- Don't go out there, please.
- Mom.

22:35.728 --> 22:37.639
- Please trust me.
-

22:37.640 --> 22:39.608
I can take care of it.

- Come here.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.488
Oh. Oh, no.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.171
I swear,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

22:58.172 --> 23:00.128
I said get over here.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.484
Oh, no.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.688
Oh, no. Peter.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.851
No.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.331
Fucking rat!

23:35.920 --> 23:38.079
No. Stop it!

23:38.080 --> 23:39.411
<i>Stop it!</i>

23:40.800 --> 23:42.999
- Like to talk, huh?
- Asshole!

23:43.000 --> 23:44.799
Stop it! Stop, Please.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.959
<i>Stop it!</i>

23:45.960 --> 23:48.611
Stay inside.
I'm not saying it again!

23:50.760 --> 23:52.565
Come on, get up,
you piece of shit.

23:52.566 --> 23:54.608
Come on over here,
you little fucking..

24:00.240 --> 24:01.810
(grunts)

24:04.520 --> 24:07.046
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

24:11.600 --> 24:14.285
- Where is he, bitch?
- Where did you take him?

24:14.286 --> 24:16.519
I don't know. I swear.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.119
- He's lying, Caleb.
- Fucking liar!

24:19.120 --> 24:21.202
(ringing)

24:23.760 --> 24:26.399
<i>Where is he?</i>

24:26.400 --> 24:28.607
Fuck him up, man!

24:39.080 --> 24:41.321
(indistinct screaming)

24:44.720 --> 24:46.290
(Caleb): Motherfucker!

24:48.000 --> 24:50.970
(screaming)

25:42.840 --> 25:45.491
(eerie music)

25:57.560 --> 26:00.211
(siren wailing)

26:02.000 --> 26:04.082
Ana, they found us.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.244
No.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.290
Please.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.165
Please.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.489
No, don't.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.765
No.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.887
Stop! Don't.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.206
Please. I'm pregnant!

26:56.040 --> 26:57.041
What?

26:59.840 --> 27:03.039
No, no.
It's... it's impossible. No.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.805
I'm sorry,
animals aren't enough.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.479
But we're sick.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.448
Maybe he isn't.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.919
I'm sorry.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.888
It's too dangerous.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.919
- It's too dangerous.
- No!

27:23.920 --> 27:25.759
Please, stop it! No!

27:25.760 --> 27:27.364
Martin, stop!

27:29.400 --> 27:31.209
No!

27:38.960 --> 27:40.919
No. (Crash)

27:40.920 --> 27:42.763
<i>(Man): Open the fucking door,
you sick fuck!</i>

27:42.764 --> 27:45.399
<i>Open the door,
you motherfucker!</i>

27:45.400 --> 27:47.801
<i>You fucking animals,
you killed my sister!</i>

27:47.802 --> 27:50.041
<i>Open the fucking door,
you assholes!</i>

27:50.042 --> 27:53.839
<i>Goddamn door!
Goddamn fucking assholes!</i>

27:53.840 --> 27:57.719
- Open the fucking door!
- Ana! Ana, Stop!

27:57.720 --> 27:59.679
Please.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.808
Ana! Stop! Ana! -

28:03.920 --> 28:06.082
There he is! Get him, Billy!

28:28.000 --> 28:30.924
(monitor beeping)

28:49.760 --> 28:51.410
(sighs)

28:59.440 --> 29:01.408
Is this yours?

29:05.800 --> 29:08.007
What did you do with the body?

29:09.600 --> 29:11.523
Where did you hide him?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.002
He wasn't dead.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.570
Bullshit!

29:19.760 --> 29:22.439
I swear
I'm telling the truth, sir.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.568
That's why I helped him out.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.442
So where is he now?

29:32.320 --> 29:34.891
I don't know, sir. I swear.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.966
He left last night.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.530
By himself?

29:45.040 --> 29:46.559
<i>(Man): Lieutenant.</i>

29:46.560 --> 29:47.679
I'm busy here.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.119
I know. I'm sorry, sir.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.122
We found your son's friend.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.726
<i>Okay-</i>

30:08.320 --> 30:10.923
(Man): He was still alive
when they brought him here.

30:10.924 --> 30:13.400
And they severed his
jugular and he bled out.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.570
Coroner put his time of death
about 8 to 10 hours ago.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.482
Did you close Route 15?

30:23.520 --> 30:25.439
Yeah.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.601
The team says
they're getting upset.

30:26.602 --> 30:28.362
They wanna talk to the chief.

30:28.363 --> 30:30.886
The chief is in Black River,
I'm in charge now.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.119
But, lieutenant,
even if we set up road blocks

30:35.120 --> 30:36.804
we still have no idea
who we're looking for.

30:36.805 --> 30:37.919
Yeah, we do.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.439
Caucasian male, 6 feet tall,

30:40.440 --> 30:43.046
30-35, brown hair with a beard.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.679
Start looking for him.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.011
Yes, sir.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.759
I need your assistance.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.519
(cell phone vibrating)

30:52.520 --> 30:54.204
De Luca.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.287
Okay.
Yeah, okay, I'm on my way!

31:05.640 --> 31:07.483
(Man): He had a heart attack.

31:07.484 --> 31:11.239
Probably caused by
thrombosis due to the burns.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.719
He's stable for now but, uh...

31:13.720 --> 31:16.690
His blood levels
dropped dangerously low.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.007
He could have
another thrombosis...

31:20.008 --> 31:22.239
or an embolism.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.559
And this time,
it could be fatal.

31:25.560 --> 31:29.999
My son is gonna live
longer than you and me.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.571
- Understood?
- Yeah.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.250
(instrumental music)

32:05.200 --> 32:07.202
(sobbing)

32:54.760 --> 32:56.250
(honking)

33:05.400 --> 33:09.159
We have a conversation
to finish. Get in.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.639
I can't.

33:10.640 --> 33:14.039
What about my bike
and my things?

33:14.040 --> 33:16.679
Nobody's gonna steal your shit.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.409
Get in the car.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.602
Get in the car.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.530
Come on!

33:49.760 --> 33:52.366
(door creaking)

34:09.400 --> 34:11.846
I swear I've told you
everything I know!

34:11.847 --> 34:13.842
I'm not protecting him!

34:14.880 --> 34:16.370
<i>Please, sir!</i>

34:19.920 --> 34:22.081
What do you want?

34:37.080 --> 34:39.399
I wanna talk.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.889
Here?

34:46.560 --> 34:49.130
Get out of the car.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.043
(rattling)

35:23.360 --> 35:25.601
(instrumental music)

36:03.120 --> 36:06.159
Okay, cuff yourself to that.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.879
What for?

36:07.880 --> 36:09.319
Do it.

36:09.320 --> 36:11.402
I swear I won't run away, sir.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.128
I'll tell you
whatever you want!

36:23.040 --> 36:24.644
Come on.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.005
I told you not to lie to me.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.044
I didn't lie! I swear
I was telling the truth!

36:48.960 --> 36:51.686
You told me you didn't
know who he was.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.839
I don't! He came by my house.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.399
But I've never seen him before!

36:56.400 --> 36:57.845
<i>Okay-</i>

36:59.600 --> 37:01.170
I'll give you one more shot.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.359
Do you wanna know
how my son feels?

37:05.360 --> 37:06.759
Please, sir!

37:06.760 --> 37:09.719
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

37:09.720 --> 37:10.960
I swear!

37:12.520 --> 37:14.239
You motherfucker!

37:14.240 --> 37:17.210
No! No! No!

37:44.760 --> 37:47.491
(intense music)

38:57.120 --> 39:00.090
(groans)

39:07.160 --> 39:09.481
(gunshots)

39:11.040 --> 39:13.042
You thought you were gonna
get away, motherfucker?

39:13.043 --> 39:14.690
(grunts)

39:27.280 --> 39:30.363
(groans)

39:39.680 --> 39:42.286
(door opens)

39:57.280 --> 39:59.799
What happened? Oh, my God!

39:59.800 --> 40:02.246
What are you doing? I have
to take him to the hospital!

40:02.247 --> 40:05.199
And look at him! Let me go..

40:05.200 --> 40:08.807
In 5 minutes he will be dead,
and I won't be able to help him.

40:08.808 --> 40:12.009
So keep quiet and don't move.

40:14.720 --> 40:17.405
(muttering in Latin)

40:20.360 --> 40:22.328
What are you doing?

40:24.040 --> 40:25.405
You..

40:28.760 --> 40:30.799
Oh, my God.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.639
I need an ambulance.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.119
My son has been in an accident!

40:35.120 --> 40:38.799
20905 Anderson Drive.

40:38.800 --> 40:42.839
He's dying, please send
someone right away!

40:42.840 --> 40:45.161
What are you doing?
Are you insane?

40:45.162 --> 40:48.439
Leave my son alone!
I'm begging you!

40:48.440 --> 40:51.079
Please, hurry up! Please!

40:51.080 --> 40:53.048
Please, please.

40:54.440 --> 40:58.239
Sweetie, hold on.
The ambulance is on its...

40:58.240 --> 41:00.799
The ambulance is on its way.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.479
My love, sweetie, please.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.209
What happened to Ana?

41:07.800 --> 41:09.802
Is he your son?

41:10.880 --> 41:12.848
Get out of my house!

41:14.440 --> 41:16.647
Get out!

41:24.720 --> 41:26.006
Hold on.

41:30.520 --> 41:34.203
(Doctor): I'm really sorry, Monica,
but I still don't understand.

41:34.204 --> 41:36.123
How could this happen to him?

41:36.124 --> 41:38.679
<i>He probably wasn't looking.</i>

41:38.680 --> 41:42.924
And when he lit the match,
the can exploded.

41:44.320 --> 41:47.164
Monica, Peter has burns
of different degrees

41:47.165 --> 41:49.839
on different parts of his body.

41:49.840 --> 41:53.162
Are you absolutely certain
this was an accident?

41:53.163 --> 41:56.479
He's always been so reckless.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.609
Alright. I'll come back later
to see how he's doing.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.682
- Thank you.
- Okay.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.841
(sobbing)

42:29.600 --> 42:31.887
Is Peter Ana's son?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.759
What are you doing here again?

42:37.760 --> 42:39.808
She was my wife.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.923
I need to know what happened.

42:42.680 --> 42:46.207
If she was your wife,
then you should know.

42:47.640 --> 42:50.479
She was running away from you.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.767
What happened?

42:58.960 --> 43:01.930
(instrumental music)

43:28.960 --> 43:30.928
<i>(Mom): Good morning, Ana.</i>

43:33.120 --> 43:35.009
Would you like me to take him?

43:35.010 --> 43:37.199
Yes, please.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.886
Goodbye, my love. Don't worry,
she'll take care of you.

43:46.840 --> 43:49.599
Should I close the curtains?

43:49.600 --> 43:52.279
No, I'd like to
watch the sunrise.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.850
<i>Okay-</i>

44:00.000 --> 44:02.970
(music continues)

44:25.480 --> 44:27.562
Nobody knew
what happened to her.

44:29.880 --> 44:33.930
Ana wasn't normal,
she... she was sick.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.123
I know, but Peter...

44:40.160 --> 44:41.446
was born healthy.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.567
He's not a danger to anyone.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.079
How do you know that?

44:48.080 --> 44:50.208
Because he's my son!

44:55.280 --> 44:58.523
The only danger here is you.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.602
(breathing heavily)

45:20.440 --> 45:22.522
Goddamn kid.

45:24.120 --> 45:26.248
(monitor beeping)

45:45.000 --> 45:47.571
(intense music)

45:49.520 --> 45:50.719
(honking)

45:50.720 --> 45:52.643
(tires screeching)

45:59.800 --> 46:02.770
(siren wailing)

46:36.680 --> 46:38.887
(sighs)

46:48.280 --> 46:50.681
(Lieutenant): I don't know
how you made it out alive

46:50.682 --> 46:52.364
or where the fuck
you came from,

46:52.365 --> 46:56.001
but your life is gonna
end in this fucking cell.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.684
What you did to Caleb
is nothing compared

46:59.685 --> 47:02.331
to what I'm gonna do
to your sorry ass.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.401
You hear me, you piece of shit?

47:08.520 --> 47:10.999
Send my regards to your son.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.999
Motherfucker!

47:13.000 --> 47:15.002
I'll kill you right now.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.488
(suspenseful music)

47:28.600 --> 47:30.967
Then what are you waiting for?

47:39.760 --> 47:41.000
Everything Okay?

47:43.760 --> 47:44.966
Yeah.

47:46.840 --> 47:48.679
Everything's fine.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.808
Friendly little chat,
that's all.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.442
Quit breathing down
my neck, Harris.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.888
(birds chirping)

48:20.360 --> 48:21.771
Mom.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.927
Mom. Mom?

48:31.040 --> 48:34.010
(monitor beeping)

48:35.840 --> 48:39.799
Sweetie, how are you feeling?

48:39.800 --> 48:41.768
Better.

48:42.560 --> 48:43.971
(Woman): Morning, Monica.

48:43.972 --> 48:46.999
- Hi, Sonia.
- Hi.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.207
(Sonia): Looks like we're
feeling better today, Peter.

48:52.120 --> 48:55.521
We're gonna change the
bandages on your arms, okay?

48:55.522 --> 48:57.602
Can you lift your arm
up a little for me?

48:58.800 --> 49:00.768
That's good.

49:02.600 --> 49:05.570
(melancholy music)

49:12.280 --> 49:14.959
Something's not right here.

49:14.960 --> 49:18.079
It's been less than 12 hours.

49:18.080 --> 49:20.811
No. No. Don't touch it,
it can get infected.

49:20.812 --> 49:22.919
It's okay, Mom.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.959
It doesn't hurt anymore.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.599
Doesn't hurt at all.

49:27.600 --> 49:29.568
Wait, let me help you.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.288
(instrumental music)

49:39.840 --> 49:41.808
Oh my God.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.279
(Mom): Are you ready?

49:51.280 --> 49:52.679
No, not really.

49:52.680 --> 49:55.406
Just bring whatever
you need right now.

49:55.407 --> 49:58.439
We can pick up the rest later.

49:58.440 --> 50:00.679
We can't come back, Mom.

50:00.680 --> 50:02.799
We'll have to see about that.

50:02.800 --> 50:06.361
Hurry up; We can still make
the 11 o'clock bus, okay?

50:07.680 --> 50:09.125
<i>Okay-</i>

50:10.520 --> 50:13.285
(monitor beeping)

50:27.400 --> 50:30.370
(dramatic music)

50:34.480 --> 50:35.959
May I help you, sir?

50:35.960 --> 50:38.964
Yes, what happened to the boy
who was in this bed?

50:38.965 --> 50:41.879
- Did he die?
- No, he was discharged.

50:41.880 --> 50:43.163
- You sure?
- Yes.

50:43.164 --> 50:44.321
He left this morning.

50:44.322 --> 50:46.482
It was a miracle.

51:00.960 --> 51:02.564
Come on.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.768
What's happening?

51:10.600 --> 51:12.568
(knocking)

51:13.680 --> 51:15.648
Sorry. Thank you!

51:22.240 --> 51:24.607
(siren wailing)

51:46.640 --> 51:48.165
- Fuck!
- Fuck.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.119
Don't stop! Please!

51:51.120 --> 51:52.323
He's trying to kill us.

51:52.324 --> 51:54.004
Please don't stop the bus.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.089
No!

51:59.560 --> 52:01.528
(suspenseful music)

52:03.440 --> 52:06.091
Hey. I'm looking
for two passengers.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.648
How did you heal so fast?

52:32.440 --> 52:33.805
What did they do to you?

52:38.840 --> 52:40.842
I just wanna help my son.

52:42.760 --> 52:46.242
Please. Just tell me.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.762
Please, or he's going to die.

52:54.640 --> 52:57.041
Please tell me.
What the fuck did you do?

53:13.720 --> 53:16.007
- No! Leave him alone.
- You stay here!

53:22.640 --> 53:24.519
(thud)

53:24.520 --> 53:25.999
(Mom): No!

53:26.000 --> 53:27.081
- Stop!
- Tell me!

53:27.082 --> 53:29.204
- Stop!
- Tell me what you did,

53:29.205 --> 53:30.679
or I'll kill him right here.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.330
- No. Don't tell him anything.
- You shut the fuck up.

53:32.331 --> 53:34.288
He'll kill us anyway.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.679
If you talk...

53:37.680 --> 53:39.648
I'll let you go.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.848
No, Mom. No.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.368
Swear you'll let us go.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.084
You have my word.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.284
<i>(Mom): We should take
the sample at the hospital.</i>

54:11.285 --> 54:12.964
<i>(Lieutenant): No,
we can't let him out.</i>

54:13.160 --> 54:14.571
<i>We gotta do it here.</i>

54:25.400 --> 54:27.639
Lieutenant,
you can't take a blood sample

54:27.640 --> 54:29.005
without a court order.
You know that.

54:29.006 --> 54:31.799
I told you to
get off my back, Harris.

54:31.800 --> 54:34.929
I'm sorry, sir, but I may have
to call the chief on this one.

54:35.760 --> 54:38.525
You go over my head on this
and you have no idea

54:38.526 --> 54:40.479
what's in the store for you.

54:40.480 --> 54:42.448
Understood?

54:44.480 --> 54:46.279
Alright, boys, go ahead.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.399
I got this.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.368
Come on.

54:53.320 --> 54:55.926
(thuds)

54:56.080 --> 54:58.208
Ah! No!

55:00.440 --> 55:03.649
No! No! No!

55:08.120 --> 55:09.531
Go ahead.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.843
(groaning)

55:19.120 --> 55:21.691
Please, don't do...
Please, don't do this.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.368
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

55:28.640 --> 55:30.839
Please, don't do this.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.959
Please, don't... Please, don't.

55:33.960 --> 55:40.679
You have no idea
of what you're doing.

55:40.680 --> 55:43.968
This is extremely contagious.
Please, don't do this.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.879
(dramatic music)

55:48.880 --> 55:51.319
- Go on.
- No. No!

55:51.320 --> 55:53.039
No, don't touch my blood.

55:53.040 --> 55:55.319
(grunting)

55:55.320 --> 55:57.288
No!

55:58.600 --> 56:00.568
(dramatic music)

56:04.240 --> 56:06.322
The blood needs to be blessed.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.639
No. No. No.

56:09.640 --> 56:11.439
No!

56:11.440 --> 56:12.719
No.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.688
(speaking in Latin)

56:17.360 --> 56:19.079
(speaking in Latin)

56:19.080 --> 56:20.889
Shut him the hell up.

56:24.040 --> 56:26.964
(melancholy music)

56:52.000 --> 56:54.399
(gasps heavily)

56:54.400 --> 56:55.686
(Lieutenant):
Hang in there, Caleb.

56:55.687 --> 56:58.251
Hold on,
everything's gonna be alright.

56:58.252 --> 56:59.879
(groans)

56:59.880 --> 57:00.847
Keep going.

57:02.040 --> 57:04.407
(monitor beeping)

57:12.240 --> 57:15.319
<i>(Man): I don't know, man, he's
been acting really weird lately.</i>

57:15.320 --> 57:16.651
<i>I understand his
kid's hurt and all</i>

57:16.652 --> 57:18.802
<i>but he doesn't have to
be a jerk to everyone.</i>

57:23.160 --> 57:25.527
(instrumental music)

57:27.360 --> 57:30.330
(metal clanking)

58:05.880 --> 58:07.689
(monitor beeping)

58:12.120 --> 58:15.090
(coughs)

58:18.440 --> 58:19.519
No.

58:19.520 --> 58:20.959
Wait.

58:20.960 --> 58:22.439
Easy.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.959
Take it easy.

58:23.960 --> 58:25.928
(coughing continues)

58:28.720 --> 58:33.442
Take a deep breath
and lie down.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.279
(gasping)

58:37.280 --> 58:39.567
I'm calling your father.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.884
He should be here.

58:49.080 --> 58:51.048
(suspenseful music)

58:52.240 --> 58:54.322
(cell phone rings)

58:57.960 --> 58:59.962
What's happening?

59:01.960 --> 59:03.928
(cell phone rings)

59:08.160 --> 59:10.128
(instrumental music)

59:11.800 --> 59:13.928
What the fuck?

59:18.320 --> 59:20.561
I feel better.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.362
(phone rings)

59:38.600 --> 59:40.682
Grey Mountain, second precinct.

59:44.200 --> 59:45.964
Calm... calm down, sir.
Where are you?

59:45.965 --> 59:47.519
118..

59:47.520 --> 59:49.602
Okay, we'll send somebody
down there right..

59:52.280 --> 59:53.770
Are you sure it was him?

59:55.360 --> 59:57.324
Ben, get the chief
down here immediately.

59:57.325 --> 59:59.524
- Tell him it's urgent.
- Okay. Come with me.

59:59.525 --> 01:00:01.602
Okay.
Can you describe him for me?

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.962
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.090
Oh my God. (Siren wailing)

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.887
Wash up, and get rid
of those clothes.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.810
<i>(Peter): What happened?</i>

01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:37.639
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.801
Let me go!

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.570
Mom!

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.571
(intense music)

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.290
(door opens) (footsteps)

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.483
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Caleb?

01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:42.322
Where you think you're going?

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:45.449
To find the motherfucker
that did this to me.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.199
<i>Okay-</i>

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.519
Calm down.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.205
We have to go before anyone
comes looking for you.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.010
I don't care.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.521
Listen, Caleb...
(siren wailing)

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.084
<i>(Lieutenant): Shit.</i>

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.771
(suspenseful music)

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.088
Close all the access
roads too, okay?

01:02:18.089 --> 01:02:19.879
Nobody can get through.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.685
Yeah, I... I just talked
to Black River.

01:02:21.686 --> 01:02:23.921
- They said they're gonna...
- Where's the stranger?

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.999
Uh, let me call you right back.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.651
Um, he can't have
any visitors right now.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.682
Listen, I understand
what you're going through...

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.761
But it's probably best
if you just go home, okay?

01:02:38.762 --> 01:02:41.799
You have to let him go, please.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.126
Sorry, I can't do that.

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:46.124
Please! He's the only one
who can help my mom.

01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:48.639
<i>You have to let him go. Now!</i>

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.199
Sorry about your mom, kid.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.770
There's nothing you can
do to help her now.

01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:54.922
He can! Let him go, please.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.082
Hey! Get back here!

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.006
Take it easy, man.

01:03:01.007 --> 01:03:02.639
Calm down!

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.079
I promise you
we're doing everything...

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.366
Alright, man.
Come on, come on, come on...

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.040
- Let him go. Right now!
- Calm down, please.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.359
Calm down, calm down.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.964
Think about what you're doing,
this is stupid.

01:03:11.965 --> 01:03:14.599
- Let him go!
- Come on, man.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.568
Go!

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.088
(dramatic music)

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.285
Open it.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.359
Dumb move, kid.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.601
You just got yourself into
a whole lot of trouble...

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.319
(grunting)

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.288
(gunshot)

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.928
open up.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.644
You have to save my mother.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.523
Please, you have to save her.

01:04:06.524 --> 01:04:08.488
Is she still alive?

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.642
Sorry kid, I can't heal the...

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.651
Where's the infected one?

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.122
I need to find him.
Where is he?

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.448
Where is he?

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.479
De Luca, open the
door right now!

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.891
That's an order!

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.039
Just a minute, sir.
I'll be right out.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.999
Go around back.
I'll distract them out front.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.889
<i>(Chief): Okay, De Luca,
you stop playing around</i>

01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:47.848
<i>and open this damn
door right now!</i>

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.482
Get out of here.
Go out the back.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.090
Lieutenant, this is your
final warning.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.719
Please, go, now!

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.688
Get the fuck out of here!

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.283
What the fuck are you doing?

01:05:07.284 --> 01:05:09.248
You crazy? They're coming in.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.728
(knocking)

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.719
- Yes?
- Get out.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.688
Okay. Okay.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.328
(intense music)

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.925
Stay in the car.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.161
(dramatic music)

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.522
<i>(Man): There's a cruiser approaching
at high speed on Baywood.</i>

01:06:53.523 --> 01:06:56.091
<i>I can't see the plates, but I
think they're the suspects.</i>

01:06:56.092 --> 01:06:57.879
<i>(Man #2): Copy that.</i>

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.483
<i>Just make them stop.

<i>They should be there
any minute.</i>

01:07:02.404 --> 01:07:04.368
<i>Copy.</i>

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.248
Get out of the vehicle, please.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.928
(suspenseful music)

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.048
Get out of the vehicle, now!

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.248
Please, sir.
Get out of the vehicle!

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.010
(gagging)

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.848
We gotta gotta to!
They're trying to leave...

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.921
I'll call an ambulance.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.486
(bones cracking)

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.608
Why didn't you save him?

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.008
He was infected.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.370
(melancholy music)

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.198
Head south.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.122
I'll buy you some time.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.810
I'm not going anywhere.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.048
Please.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.888
Do it for me.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.242
If not me,
then for your mother.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.685
I know all this
has been my fault...

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.126
but please try not
to hurt anyone else.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.520
Can you promise me that?

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.688
<i>(Martin): Ana...</i>

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.528
She was like you.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.570
Yeah.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.368
But she was stronger.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.288
She gave her life for her son.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.448
(dramatic music)

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.768
How many more are out there?

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.324
I was the last one...

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.569
Until yesterday.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.848
Why did you want to find her?

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.088
Would you have killed
your son too?

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.159
(dramatic music)

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.605
Why did you have that same...

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.810
(glass shattering)

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.286
(engine dies)

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.811
(groans)

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.965
(gun cocks)

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.606
(gunshot)

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.119
Die!

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.451
(screaming)

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.288
(groaning)

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.168
Look me in the eye.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.879
(gun cocks)

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.325
(gunshot)

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.371
(heavy breathing)

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.039
No. No, don't touch me.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.042
Your hand are cut,
you'll get infected.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.648
- Get out of here.
- It doesn't matter.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.448
I'm not leaving you here.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.559
(sighs)

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.848
If you touch me,
I'll have to kill you.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.928
- Get away from me.
- What?

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.368
You're gonna let Caleb get away?

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.203
Just like that?

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.888
- Go.
- No.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.239
I told you to leave me alone,

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.811
you deaf peace of shit!

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.528
Get the hell away from me!

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.879
(melancholy music)

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.599
I swear, I'll rip your throat...

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.568
just like your fucking mother!

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.082
Go!

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.964
Go!

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.609
(groaning)

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.044
(groaning)

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.810
What are you doing?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.126
What are you doing?

01:14:06.127 --> 01:14:08.359
Covering my wounds.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.484
I told you to get
the fuck out of here.

01:14:10.485 --> 01:14:12.562
Shut up. We need to stop Caleb.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.559
Go away.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.211
- Get out!
- Shut up and push!

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.521
(groaning)

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.248
(groaning)

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.489
(panting)

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.809
(grunts) Come on.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.165
(grunts)

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.128
I'm sorry, kid.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.446
(intense music)

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.046
(Caleb): Fuck!

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.042
(grunting)

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.569
<i>(Man on police radio):

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.688
Are you alone?

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.404
Don't worry.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.291
I... I just want to rest.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.688
(panting)

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.680
HEY! Stop! Stop!

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.851
(Woman): Are you okay?

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.765
- Who did this to you?
- Untie me.

01:18:11.766 --> 01:18:13.519
Untie me, please.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.559
Please.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.039
JESUS.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.088
(barking)

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.119
Okay, wait here.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.088
I... I'm gonna
call an ambulance.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.319
Oh, my God!

What are you doing?

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.528
(dramatic music)

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.848
So now you know what we are.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.888
We're humanity's
death sentence.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.808
There has to be a cure.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.490
Yeah.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.848

I hope you've inherited
your mother's strength.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.406
Otherwise hell will be
waiting for you out there.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.248
Thank you.
