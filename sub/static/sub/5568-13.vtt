00:05.373 --> 00:06.972
The baby's coming out!

00:06.974 --> 00:08.273
It's... it's a big one!

00:08.275 --> 00:10.509
Eddie, stop pretending
to be pregnant.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.012
I'm an uncle!

00:13.014 --> 00:14.713
(gasps) It's a boy!

00:16.150 --> 00:19.218
Oh, my God. Louis did it.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.487
He's raising his own veal.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.821
(computer beeps) Nope.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.490
I accidentally went in a store

00:24.492 --> 00:26.325
that looked like
it sold ice cream

00:26.327 --> 00:28.694
and got us our first family
Internet computer!

00:28.696 --> 00:30.029
Is it better than
my brother-in-law's?

00:30.031 --> 00:31.230
It is better than
your brother-in-law's.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.898
Do a search for Biggie lyrics.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.666
No, look up where rainbows end.

00:34.668 --> 00:35.801
Hold on.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.069
Before we touch the computer,

00:37.071 --> 00:38.537
we need to take
this course first.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.072
It's called "Mavis Beacon's
Introduction..."

00:40.074 --> 00:41.540
(keyboard clacking,
monitor beeps)

00:41.542 --> 00:44.209
I just did a search
for Cattleman's Ranch.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.844
How did you do that?
(mouse clicks)

00:45.846 --> 00:48.013
Just type in a word,
or Lycos it,

00:48.015 --> 00:51.183
and if it's anywhere on
the Internet, it'll come up.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.651
Oh, look, we're mentioned

00:52.653 --> 00:55.421
on a restaurant-review site
called Phil's Phaves!

00:55.423 --> 00:59.425
(<i> Happy music plays</i> )

00:59.427 --> 01:01.260
It's a beautiful design.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.495
(mouse clicks) Uh-oh.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.931
They give out letter grades
to all the restaurants.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.032
Dad's got a...

01:07.034 --> 01:08.500
B-minus?!

01:08.502 --> 01:11.637
BOTH: That's a Chinese "F."

01:12.540 --> 01:14.740
Captions by VITAC...

01:16.243 --> 01:17.943
¶ I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go ¶

01:17.945 --> 01:19.745
¶ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ¶

01:19.747 --> 01:21.380
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:21.382 --> 01:23.715
¶ Homey, you don't know

01:23.717 --> 01:25.217

01:25.219 --> 01:27.920
¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶

01:28.689 --> 01:29.922
I don't understand.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.191
How could Cattleman's
get a B-minus?

01:32.193 --> 01:35.094
Well, dad, maybe
if you<i> applied</i> yourself,

01:35.096 --> 01:37.062
your grades would be higher.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.797
JESSICA: Boys, this is serious.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.900
Why don't the dancing babies
like our restaurant?

01:41.902 --> 01:42.968
(mouse clicks)

01:42.970 --> 01:44.403
According to the review,

01:44.405 --> 01:45.804
this Phil guy thought
the food was okay,

01:45.806 --> 01:47.272
but the ambiance was a bit dull.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.441
Dull? Dull?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.410
As in boring? Repetitive?

01:51.412 --> 01:53.212
Dull? That's impossible.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.614
I make sure Cattleman's is
the funnest restaurant in town!

01:55.616 --> 01:57.382
At least it's only
on the Internet.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.717
It's not somewhere important

01:58.719 --> 02:00.419
like a newspaper
or shopping bag.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.421
I mean, how many people
could've seen it?

02:02.423 --> 02:05.457
(mouse clicks)
According to the counter, 149.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.592
(gasps) What?!

02:06.594 --> 02:08.293
Our reputation is at stake.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.895
Evan, write the Internet.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.131
Tell them to take
that grade down!

02:12.133 --> 02:13.765
It's not that easy,

02:13.767 --> 02:16.635
but there<i> is</i> a button to contact
the webmaster.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.970
Yes. Do that. Okay.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.438
Ask Phil to give us
another chance.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.273
Like the real cattlemen
of the old west,

02:21.275 --> 02:23.609
we need to defend our restaurant
against enemy attack.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.576
(monitor beeps)

02:24.578 --> 02:26.111
According to this,

02:26.113 --> 02:27.946
most cattlemen were killed
by poor sanitation.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.516
No more computer for today!

02:30.518 --> 02:32.351
(bell rings,
indistinct conversations)

02:32.353 --> 02:35.287
"Liquid Swords" might be the
best solo Wu-Tang album ever.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.990
You think it's better
than ODB's solo album?

02:37.992 --> 02:41.760
Well, better than the clean
for sure, not the dirty.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.862
That's 'cause they don't call
him Ol' Clean Bastard.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.131
WOMAN: Alison,
get your butt in gear!

02:46.133 --> 02:48.534
The longer you wait,
the faster I have to drive,

02:48.536 --> 02:50.702
and you know that
we don't have seatbelts!

02:50.704 --> 02:53.539
I wish I could keep rapping
with you, girl.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.606
Why don't you give me a call?

02:54.608 --> 02:56.108
On the phone?

02:56.110 --> 02:57.543
(chuckling) Of course, silly.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.011
My number's easy to remember.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.613
It's 407-555-CORN.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.082
I figured it out one day.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.719
Hi, Eddie. (Sighs)

03:07.721 --> 03:09.855
Hi, Reba.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.857
I told a joke during
morning announcements

03:11.859 --> 03:13.292
that I thought you would like.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.226
Did you hear it?

03:14.228 --> 03:18.063
<i>Good</i> morning, students.

03:18.065 --> 03:22.568
Quick question...
What kind of bees give milk?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.902
Boo-bees. (Boobies)

03:23.904 --> 03:25.304
MAN: Reba!

03:25.306 --> 03:27.372
Just announce that P.E.
is indoors today!

03:27.374 --> 03:28.707
Sorry. I missed it.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.576
I like that you went there,
though.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.980
Um, is that my face
on your trapper keeper?

03:34.982 --> 03:36.315
Yep.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.983
You know I have a girlfriend,
right?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.985
Alison. I know.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.820
I call next.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.222
Right.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.225
See you, Reba.

03:46.227 --> 03:49.928
I hate to see him go,
but I love to watch his butt.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.102
Are you<i> still</i> on the computer?

03:57.104 --> 03:59.538
I want to work
on my keyboarding.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.107
We need to monitor how many
people are seeing

04:02.109 --> 04:03.909
this stain on our reputation.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.078
Luckily,
it's holding steady at 149.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.512
You wouldn't be able to tell

04:07.514 --> 04:09.114
unless you hit
the refresh button.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.549
Refresh button?

04:10.551 --> 04:11.917
(mouse clicks)

04:11.919 --> 04:13.385
(both scream)

04:13.387 --> 04:14.720
It went up to 154!

04:14.722 --> 04:17.022
Oh, what if one of
my enemies saw it?

04:17.024 --> 04:18.557
Or Pete Sampras?

04:18.559 --> 04:21.393
Have you checked your e-mail
to see if they wrote back?

04:21.395 --> 04:24.463
Mail? At this time of night?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.032
(mouse clicks)

04:27.034 --> 04:28.734
<i>You've got mail.</i>

04:28.736 --> 04:30.802
Well, of course
it's a white guy.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.237
Phil wrote back. (Mouse clicks)

04:32.239 --> 04:34.606
He says he'll give us
another chance.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.609
He's coming back to the
restaurant on Wednesday.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.645
Okay, this is our shot
at redemption.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.747
We need to make sure
Cattleman's Ranch

04:41.749 --> 04:43.548
is funner than it's ever been...

04:43.550 --> 04:47.352
Even if it means replacing every
"C" with a backward "K."

04:49.590 --> 04:51.790
Four... (beep)

04:51.792 --> 04:54.059
(groans)

04:56.297 --> 04:58.263
Hello. (Groans)

04:58.265 --> 04:59.798
'Sup? (Groans)

05:02.136 --> 05:06.338
(dialing) 555-C-O-R-N.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.473
(ringing)

05:08.475 --> 05:09.441
(sighs)

05:09.443 --> 05:10.942
Hello?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.611
Hello. Who's this? Dad?

05:12.613 --> 05:13.578
Sweetie?

05:13.580 --> 05:15.480
(dialing)

05:15.482 --> 05:18.083
Hello? Is someone on the phone?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.451
Hello. Who's this?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.286
This is Louis Huang. Who's this?

05:21.288 --> 05:22.354
This is Gary Olsen.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.989
Gary Olsen? (Grunts)

05:23.991 --> 05:25.824
That was a disaster.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.659
I know. I was listening.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.995
I hate talking on the phone.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.632
She can't see me, and I'm like
80% body language.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.001
She doesn't know if I'm like,
"What's happening?"

05:36.003 --> 05:37.803
Or if I'm like,
"What's happening?"

05:41.108 --> 05:42.741
So, what are you gonna do?

05:42.742 --> 05:44.375
MAN: (echoing)<i> Yeah.</i> I'm gonna
make her a dope-ass mixtape!

05:44.378 --> 05:46.044
It'll do the talking for me!

05:46.046 --> 05:48.280
That's a great idea, Eddie.

05:48.282 --> 05:51.550
(The Dove Shack's
"Summertime in the LBC" plays)

05:55.189 --> 05:56.822
Yo, girl.

05:56.824 --> 06:00.058
This is your boy, E-Money...
Notorious E.I.G...

06:00.060 --> 06:02.294
E to the M.C.-squared.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.363
What's up, physics?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.731
For the next 90 minutes,

06:05.733 --> 06:07.566
I'm gonna make you
an audio love nest,

06:07.568 --> 06:10.302
'Cause, girl,
if you're feeling this...

06:10.304 --> 06:13.739
¶<i> Let me hear you</i>
<i>say oooooh-ooh</i> ¶

06:13.741 --> 06:16.875
¶<i> Ahhhhhhh-ahh</i> ¶

06:16.877 --> 06:20.579
¶<i> Summertime in the LBC</i> ¶

06:20.581 --> 06:23.348
LOUIS: (chuckles)
Look at these fun hens

06:23.350 --> 06:26.351
just sitting here, sunglasses
on, ready for the beach.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.387
Festive hens,
new staff uniforms,

06:28.389 --> 06:30.822
googly eyes on
the toothpick dispenser...

06:30.824 --> 06:33.325
No way Phil can call us dull.

06:33.327 --> 06:34.526
(chuckles)

06:34.528 --> 06:36.261
Uh, Mitch? Yeah?

06:36.263 --> 06:38.730
Your new comically small hat
isn't askew enough.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.401
It's supposed to be sitting on
your head at a jaunty angle.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.668
That angle is not jaunty.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.005
Jauntier.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.207
Jauntier.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.276
Jaunty. Hey, hey.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.445
BOY: Hello?

06:53.447 --> 06:55.147
Down here.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.253
Phillip Goldstein,
what are<i> you</i> doing here?

07:01.255 --> 07:02.888
I have a reservation.

07:02.890 --> 07:06.191
It's under Phil...
As in "Phil's Phaves."

07:07.227 --> 07:08.794
And I would like to sit

07:08.796 --> 07:12.030
as far away from the bear
as possible.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.641
Phillip Goldstein,

07:22.643 --> 07:24.309
the Chinese-Jewish boy
who abandoned our son

07:24.311 --> 07:25.911
at the Beastie Boys concert.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.380
I sleep well at night,
if that's your next question.

07:28.382 --> 07:30.749
Of course you sleep well.
You're a child!

07:30.751 --> 07:32.451
I thought Phil was an adult.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.320
Probably because my writing
style is straightforward

07:35.322 --> 07:36.988
and concise, like a man's.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.758
Well, whatever our differences,

07:39.760 --> 07:42.060
it is a relief
to find out it's you,

07:42.062 --> 07:44.429
just like you're finding out
that this is our restaurant.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.298
So you can go ahead
and change your review.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.732
Why would I do that?

07:47.734 --> 07:50.802
Well, you know...

07:52.339 --> 07:54.806
<i>Ju jia ren.</i>

07:54.808 --> 07:57.509
I actually don't
understand Chinese,

07:57.511 --> 08:00.145
but I do understand
good service.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.381
Do I have to seat myself?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.119
More iced tea?

08:08.121 --> 08:10.288
No, thank you. Okay.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.691
Um, that crayon
looks stubby. Here.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.526
Let me get you
some fresh points.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.961
No, those are fine!

08:15.963 --> 08:18.663
Are you enjoying
your "Khikken" nuggets?

08:18.665 --> 08:19.998
We changed all the C's to K's.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.100
It's just a little fun thing
we do.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.969
Oh, I thought that was a typo.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.971
(sighs) This is ridiculous.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.273
He's just gonna give us
a bad review anyway.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.709
I would never let our personal
history color my review.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.043
Oh. Mm.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.646
That said, I'm bumping you down
to a C-plus.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.015
A C-plus?! Did you see the
sunglasses on the hens?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.618
I didn't, because your staff
was surrounding me

08:39.620 --> 08:43.221
at every moment... refilling
my mug, taking my crayons.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.290
It was a nightmare!

08:45.292 --> 08:48.026
Nuggets were good, though.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.496
And that's why I say
that Marky Mark

08:51.498 --> 08:53.732
is the<i> nucleus</i>
of the funky bunch.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.066
Huh?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.002
I made you something.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.638
You did? What is it?
After class.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.706
All right,
now to turn our attention

09:01.708 --> 09:04.342
from the subatomic world
to the state-mandated,

09:04.344 --> 09:06.878
although not state-funded,
unit on dissection.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.747
Namely...

09:08.749 --> 09:09.814
Rocks?

09:09.816 --> 09:11.249
No. Oysters.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.817
(kids murmur)
Unfortunately, it wasn't

09:12.819 --> 09:14.386
until I got to the supermarket

09:14.388 --> 09:16.021
that I realized how expensive
these suckers are,

09:16.023 --> 09:18.023
so we're gonna have
to pair off two to an oyster.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.891
MAN: (<i> echoing</i> )<i> Yeah.</i>

09:19.893 --> 09:22.160
Like Marky Mark,
let's do the unexpected.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.062
Alison,
you can partner with Ned.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.363
Eddie, you're with Reba.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.833
(<i> Echoing</i> )<i> No.</i>

09:28.835 --> 09:31.603
You're in my station.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.577
Hi, Eddie. This is gonna be fun.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.744
For who?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.212
I understand.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.416
You're too gentle to dissect
a living creature.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.252
<i>But</i> lucky for us,
I don't give an "elf."

09:47.254 --> 09:50.322
I'll fill out your
dissection journal for you.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.461
All right. Let's see
what's under the hood.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.368
Cattleman's Ranch
is our livelihood.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.636
So you can understand
our concern

10:04.638 --> 10:06.605
when we found
your son's website.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.939
Oh, I do understand.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.408
I am so sorry
about Phillip's review.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.377
(sighs) Great.
So you'll take it down?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.245
Oh, no, I can't do that.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.548
Phillip's father and I
have been teaching him

10:16.550 --> 10:18.049
about journalistic integrity

10:18.051 --> 10:20.819
from our years working
at<i> Mother Jones.</i>

10:22.289 --> 10:24.456
<i>Miteh, haust du gizane mana...</i>

10:24.458 --> 10:25.657
<i>Oy.</i>

10:25.659 --> 10:28.727
Oh, now, Phillip, don't be rude.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.895
No Yiddish in front
of the goyim.

10:30.897 --> 10:34.466
Only one Chinese boy can tarnish
the Huang family name,

10:34.468 --> 10:35.667
and that's Eddie.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.669
Please take down your website!

10:37.671 --> 10:40.238
I can't do that.
It's called integrity, madam.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.107
But I just want you...
W-we understand.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.342
Thanks for hearing us out.
We'll be on our way.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.346
May I just use
your restroom first?

10:49.316 --> 10:52.283
I didn't really go
to the bathroom.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.485
Is that their computer mouse?

10:53.487 --> 10:54.853
Yes.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.155
I've crippled his access
to the Internet.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.256
I've shut him down.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.525
You're a genius.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.461
(telephone rings)

11:03.463 --> 11:05.797
EMERY: Eddie, it's for you!

11:05.799 --> 11:08.166
(singsong voice) It's a girl!

11:11.371 --> 11:12.804
Alison?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.472
Don't worry. It's not her.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.041
Reba?

11:16.043 --> 11:19.377
I got your mixtape,
and I love you, too!

11:19.379 --> 11:21.413
(dial tone)

11:28.689 --> 11:30.822
EVAN: Oh, Da-a-mn.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.157
Evan?!

11:32.159 --> 11:33.291
No.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.559
(line clicks)

11:37.631 --> 11:40.165
Reba? Egg-salad Reba?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.667
Why don't you just tell her
the mixtape wasn't for her?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.135
I tried.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.405
Reba, I made that mixtape
for Alison, not for you.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.740
I understand.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.141
You're unhappy
in your relationship,

11:50.143 --> 11:51.376
and you don't know how
to get out.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.577
I'll talk to Alison for you.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.213
No! I mean,<i> I'll</i> do it.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.716
Like what Sisters With Voices
said on your mixtape,

11:57.718 --> 12:01.920
¶ 'Cause my heart starts
beatin' triple time ¶

12:01.922 --> 12:05.490
¶ With thoughts of lovin' you
on my mind ¶

12:05.492 --> 12:07.492
You put Sisters With Voices
on there?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.160
It's a good-ass song.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.395
(<i> Microphone feedback</i> )

12:10.397 --> 12:12.097
Reba: Good<i> morning, students!</i>

12:12.099 --> 12:13.832
To the mix master supreme

12:13.834 --> 12:16.601
who taught me the way
to a woman's heart

12:16.603 --> 12:18.336
is through her ear holes.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.838
Hi, Eddie!

12:19.840 --> 12:22.941
<i>A big shoutout
to my new boyfriend...</i>

12:22.943 --> 12:25.043
(fire alarm blaring)

12:25.045 --> 12:29.013
Tell the firemen I know how busy
they are and I'm sorry!

12:29.015 --> 12:32.951
I don't understand.
How did Phillip update it?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.620
EVAN: Taking his mouse doesn't
make his website disappear.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.956
But he has no way
to control the little hand.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.224
There's only one thing to do.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.625
Evan, I'm extending
your bedtime.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.960
But why?!

12:41.962 --> 12:44.696
I need you to make me a website.

12:46.700 --> 12:47.700
(mouse clicks)

12:52.873 --> 12:54.405
I can't believe

12:54.407 --> 12:58.643
www.phillipgoldsteinhas
badopinions.com wasn't taken.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.879
Our luck is finally
turning around.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.814
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with this.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.116
Why not?
Phillip rates our restaurant.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.151
We rate Phillip.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.919
Personality... "F."

13:07.921 --> 13:09.087
Wardrobe... "F."

13:09.089 --> 13:10.855
Table manners... "C."

13:12.425 --> 13:15.093
He used his salad fork properly.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.394
Grudging respect.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.495
Mm.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.130
This is like teasing someone

13:19.132 --> 13:20.398
but on the computer.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.566
It's like we're...

13:21.568 --> 13:23.234
E-vigilantes,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.436
because we're
dishing out justice

13:25.438 --> 13:26.838
and clearing our name.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.840
If Trent hadn't
pulled that fire alarm,

13:28.842 --> 13:31.142
Alison would think I had a honey
on the side.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.844
This Reba girl's out of control.

13:32.846 --> 13:35.146
Eddie, you can clear
this whole thing up

13:35.148 --> 13:36.481
if you just call Alison.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.683
No. Not gonna happen.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.686
I need to look my woman in
the eye like a snake charmer.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.254
So what are you gonna do?

13:43.256 --> 13:46.591
(exhales slowly)

13:46.593 --> 13:48.793
if a good mixtape can make Reba
think I love her,

13:48.795 --> 13:50.595
then a bad mixtape
can scare her away!

13:50.597 --> 13:52.363
I'm a genius!

13:52.365 --> 13:53.631
Emery, get out.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.300
You're in<i> my</i> room.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.501
Oh.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.942
Hey.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.544
I got all the lamest CDs
from my dad's collection...

14:06.546 --> 14:08.847
Alvin and the Chipmunks,
Alvin's solo album,

14:08.849 --> 14:10.949
the soundtrack
from the movie "Arthur."

14:10.951 --> 14:13.852
Oh, thanks.
These are perfect, Nicole.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.386
Weird choices for a mixtape.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.822
Well, it's kind of
an anti-mixtape.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.457
Oh, a nixtape. Been there.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.359
You trying to get rid of Alison?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.494
No. Alison is dope.
It's this other girl.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.129
You know, it's a long story.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.732
So, how's What's-his-name?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.300
Hot Chris? He's hot.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.035
He did this Forrest Gump
impression the other day.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.403
It was hilarious.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.138
(as Forrest Gump)
Lieutenant Dan,

14:34.140 --> 14:37.075
I got you ice cream.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.912
Well, I better get going.

14:40.914 --> 14:44.215
For the record,
you never made<i> me</i> a mixtape.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.732

plays)

No sign of him yet?

15:22.222 --> 15:23.354
He'll show.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.690
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Huang.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.192
Well, how did you get in here?

15:28.194 --> 15:29.727
Through the kitchen.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.363
In keeping with your barn theme,
the door was open.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.532
It's a ranch!

15:34.534 --> 15:36.768
I want you to take down

15:36.770 --> 15:38.870
Phillipgoldsteinhasbadopinions
.com.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.271
What's that?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.874
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:42.876 --> 15:45.410
Maybe one of Cattleman's
loyal customers made it

15:45.412 --> 15:47.478
after you slandered us
on the Internet.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.713
But who knows?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.548
Maybe if you take down
your bad review,

15:50.550 --> 15:52.216
that site will magically
disappear.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.919
Obviously you don't understand
how magic works.

15:54.921 --> 15:55.987
Oh, and<i> you</i> do?

16:00.794 --> 16:03.094
He just carries those around?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.229
I keep underestimating him.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.497
(bell rings)

16:06.499 --> 16:08.333
(sighs) I have some bad news.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.302
Apparently a cat got into
the storage room last night

16:11.304 --> 16:13.404
and ate up all
the oyster cadavers.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.974
So, project complete.

16:15.976 --> 16:16.908
Yes!

16:16.910 --> 16:18.176
Hey, Reba,

16:18.178 --> 16:19.477
I made you a new mixtape.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.813
So prolific.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.414
You're like the Stephen King
of love.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.283
Eddie!

16:25.285 --> 16:26.751
Is there something
you want to share

16:26.753 --> 16:27.833
with the rest of the class?

16:31.191 --> 16:32.957
"Da Real Me"?

16:32.959 --> 16:34.625
It's a tape. Huh.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.094
I guess there's no way
of knowing...

16:36.096 --> 16:37.662
You<i> could</i> put it
in the tape deck

16:37.664 --> 16:39.831
you used to teach us
about the Doppler effect.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.801
That's a very good idea, Ned.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.370
Let's do that.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.007
(<i> Enigma's</i>
<i>"Return to Innocence" plays</i> )

16:49.009 --> 16:51.109
EDDIE: <i>Yo, Reba...</i> Reba?!

16:51.111 --> 16:54.012
<i>This is what I listen to
when I clean my ears.</i>

16:54.014 --> 16:54.946
(laughter)

16:54.948 --> 16:56.280
Ew.

16:56.282 --> 16:59.684
<i>Enigma, get the wax out.</i>

16:59.686 --> 17:02.954
Thank you for coming to this
emergency parent meeting.

17:02.956 --> 17:04.889
Unfortunately,
there's a new threat

17:04.891 --> 17:06.624
targeting our students

17:06.626 --> 17:09.894
in our libraries,
on our desktops,

17:09.896 --> 17:11.496
in our homes.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.832
It's called... compu-teasing.

17:14.834 --> 17:15.900
(crowd murmurs)

17:15.902 --> 17:18.236
Uh-oh.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.471
Compu-teasing... What's that?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.673
It's like a crank call,
but on a computer,

17:22.675 --> 17:24.409
and anyone can listen in.

17:24.411 --> 17:28.479
And sadly, one of our students
has already fallen victim.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.551
He's still into drama.

17:36.489 --> 17:40.324
My name is Phillip Goldstein.

17:40.326 --> 17:43.694
I used to enjoy posting
restaurant reviews

17:43.696 --> 17:45.563
on my Internet website.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.200
But ever since I found a page
compu-teasing me,

17:49.202 --> 17:52.003
I've been too scared
to use my computer.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.538
(audience murmurs
sympathetically)

17:53.540 --> 17:56.507
You're doing great, Phillip.

17:56.509 --> 18:01.012
I have my suspicions about
who's behind the teasing,

18:01.014 --> 18:04.282
but without proof,
I won't accuse anyone.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.051
They can insult me
all they want,

18:07.053 --> 18:10.188
but I won't let them
take my integrity.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.522
(applause)

18:11.524 --> 18:13.257
That makes me love him
even more.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.693
That makes me want to kill
whoever's hurting him.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.694
Officer Bryson?

18:16.696 --> 18:18.596
He called the cops?

18:21.634 --> 18:25.536
The Orlando Police Department
takes every threat seriously.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.939
So we've created
the city's first

18:27.941 --> 18:31.576
cyber-crime division,
headed up by Peter.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.778
(slurps)

18:33.780 --> 18:36.414
With Peter's help,
we will track down

18:36.416 --> 18:39.750
Phillip's compu-teasers
and bring them to justice.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.820
Rest assured, we will not stop.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.789
They're just trying to scare us.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.891
They got nothing.
They got nothing.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.326
According to our research,

18:48.328 --> 18:50.495
the website was made
on a Gateway computer.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.463
He bought it!
He bought the computer!

18:52.465 --> 18:53.798
Uh, what? No!

18:53.800 --> 18:55.399
It was her idea
to do the website.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.735
Wait. Are you saying<i> you're</i>
the compu-teasers?

18:57.737 --> 19:00.671
No. We're e-vigilantes.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.240
(crowd murmuring)

19:02.242 --> 19:04.175
he said Cattleman's Ranch
was dull.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.910
You know me. You<i> all</i> know me.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.979
I am fun. I am fun, damn it!

19:07.981 --> 19:10.915
(crowd boos)

19:10.917 --> 19:13.351
Great work, Peter.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.419
(slurps)

19:18.691 --> 19:21.125
Hey, Eddie.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.327
You okay? I heard what happened.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.762
My life is ruined.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.632
I'll be lucky if Alison
ever speaks to me again.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.134
Eddie, just talk to her.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.702
Just call her.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.109
(dialing)

19:38.111 --> 19:40.311
(sighs)

19:40.313 --> 19:41.145
(ringing)

19:41.147 --> 19:42.647
(telephone rings)

19:42.649 --> 19:43.814
Hello?

19:43.816 --> 19:46.284
Hi, Reba. It's me, Eddie.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.853
Look, I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.521
You embarrassed yourself.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.491
Trying to discourage me
with some cornball mixtape.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.626
I know I come on
a little strong,

19:55.628 --> 19:56.727
but you know what?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.129
That's who I am.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.664
And if you can't handle that,

19:59.666 --> 20:00.898
we're never gonna work.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.333
Find yourself, boy.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.402
(dial tone)

20:04.404 --> 20:07.305
Reba.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.339
(dialing)

20:08.341 --> 20:11.008
(telephone rings)

20:11.010 --> 20:12.376
Hello?

20:12.378 --> 20:13.744
Hey, Alison. It's Eddie.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.745
Don't hang up.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.514
I'm... sorry.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.015
This whole thing happened

20:18.017 --> 20:20.518
because I was too afraid
to talk to you on the phone.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.020
I mean, Eddie,
nothing you say is gonna...

20:23.022 --> 20:24.322
(<i> 2Pac's "I Ain't Mad At Cha"</i>
<i>plays</i> )

20:24.324 --> 20:26.157
Eddie.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.558
And that's why I'm doing

20:27.560 --> 20:30.161
this special live apology mix,
just for you.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.263
And, girl,
I'm hoping you'll say...

20:32.265 --> 20:36.000
¶<i> I ain't mad at cha</i> ¶

20:36.002 --> 20:38.169
This isn't gonna make...

20:38.171 --> 20:41.772
¶ I ain't mad at cha ¶

20:41.774 --> 20:43.207
¶<i> I ain't mad at cha</i> ¶

20:43.209 --> 20:44.342
¶<i> I ain't mad at cha</i> ¶

20:44.344 --> 20:47.044
¶<i> I ain't mad at cha</i> ¶

20:47.046 --> 20:48.679
¶<i> I ain't mad at cha</i> ¶

20:48.681 --> 20:50.348
¶<i> I ain't mad at cha</i> ¶

20:50.350 --> 20:54.352
¶ I ain't mad at you ¶

20:54.354 --> 20:56.420
Kid can make a mixtape.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.463
The hell?

21:05.465 --> 21:07.131
Where's the computer?!

21:07.133 --> 21:09.400
We put it away after
being publicly shamed

21:09.402 --> 21:11.302
in front of Eddie's
entire school.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.037
We won't have time
for it anyway,

21:13.039 --> 21:15.806
what with the 100 hours of
community service we have to do.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.708
You'll sign me in, right?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.744
But you just spent
all that money on it.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.979
Well, the good thing about
computers is they last forever.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.481
We'll hook it back up
in a few years

21:23.483 --> 21:25.416
when you boys are older.
Once the heat dies down.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.052
But I just enrolled
in the University of Phoenix.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.988
I'm minoring in nursing!
