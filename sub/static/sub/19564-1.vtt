you'll catch on.

I hope not.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.201
Emily, will you marry me?

02:17.571 --> 02:18.971
I was going to get a ring first

02:18.973 --> 02:20.038

asked your dad first.

Hi, son.

Mmm.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.658
We saw <i>Lady and the
Tramp</i> at the Grand,

03:12.660 --> 03:14.493
and I don't know what it was,

03:14.495 --> 03:15.561
but something about that movie

03:15.563 --> 03:18.096
made me realize that Emily's...

Well, you know, her and I...
We just... We just...

03:24.572 --> 03:26.471

proposed to her!

Do you have a ring yet?

I don't have a ring yet.

you his blessing?

chance to ask him yet.

talk to all of you

03:55.269 --> 03:56.368

Oh, missus.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.386
Basketball is a good,
wholesome sport.

41:30.388 --> 41:31.988
It was started by Christians.

41:36.928 --> 41:39.762
But I can see
you've made up your mind.

41:39.764 --> 41:42.098
It's simply not
why they're here.

41:45.370 --> 41:47.237
We could do great things.

41:48.406 --> 41:49.739
To the Church,

41:50.408 --> 41:51.941
for basketball.

41:53.311 --> 41:55.278
I hope you'll think about it.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.613
(SCOFFS)

41:56.615 --> 41:59.015
I'm sorry we can't
help you, Mr. Watson.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.586
Well, thank you anyway.
Thanks for coming.

42:03.588 --> 42:06.122
Goodbye, Mr. Watson.
BINGHAM: Please.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.762
KEN: <i>Wouldn't have
a bar of it.</i>

42:12.764 --> 42:14.230
I thought they were
here to teach.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.832
Church stuff, not basketball.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.101
He was adamant and his
wife even more so.

42:18.103 --> 42:21.170
And do you know what? They wouldn't
even give me a cup of tea.

42:21.172 --> 42:24.073
Well, if those Mormon boys
are anything like my kids,

42:24.075 --> 42:26.576
they won't listen
to what they're told.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.379
Ken.

42:29.381 --> 42:33.750
What President Bingham
doesn't know won't hurt him.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.959
HULL: <i>Now, do not
let him shoot, okay?</i>

42:42.961 --> 42:45.562
Hands in there.
Put your hands in there.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.730
Don't let him shoot!
Don't! Come on!

42:50.702 --> 42:52.936
Thanks for
letting us come around.

42:52.938 --> 42:55.471
I haven't seen him smile
that much in a long time.

42:55.473 --> 42:57.740
It's good for him.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.343
Because he's small for his age,

43:00.345 --> 43:01.811
he has trouble fitting in.

43:03.048 --> 43:04.914
Well, he sure
does love basketball.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.015
He doesn't have much of a choice

43:06.017 --> 43:07.850
with Jim playing it
all the time.

43:07.852 --> 43:09.285
It's a good sport.

43:10.488 --> 43:13.289
He sure does idolize you blokes.

43:13.291 --> 43:16.326
Well, mostly Hull.
He's a swell kid.

43:22.033 --> 43:24.433
Would you like to stay for tea?

43:26.638 --> 43:28.771
Yes! Thank you!

43:35.013 --> 43:36.379
(ALL LAUGH)

43:36.381 --> 43:40.416
Don't! Don't let him shoot again!
Yeah! Come on.

43:40.418 --> 43:41.718
Ready? Ready?

43:41.720 --> 43:43.186
Oh, yeah.

43:53.231 --> 43:54.964
Who's Stan Page?

44:01.172 --> 44:04.692
Stan, Stan. What?

44:04.943 --> 44:07.143
Hello.
Fellas.

44:07.145 --> 44:10.346
I'm Stan Page. I believe
you've already met Ken.

44:10.348 --> 44:11.848
Thanks for coming.

44:11.850 --> 44:14.550
We got your note.
How can we help you?

44:14.552 --> 44:16.185
We were hoping to appeal to your

44:16.187 --> 44:18.721
sensibilities as sportsmen.

44:18.723 --> 44:20.963
Yes, this is our Olympic squad.

44:23.094 --> 44:25.762
As you can see,
they're pretty raw.

44:25.764 --> 44:28.231
STAN: We want you to work with
us on our skills and drills.

44:28.233 --> 44:31.334
And I could certainly use some
help as far as coaching goes.

44:32.804 --> 44:34.971
I'm sorry, Coach,

44:34.973 --> 44:37.674
but we're not allowed
to play basketball anymore.

44:37.676 --> 44:41.644
No, well, we thought you'd be
able to help us on your days off.

44:41.646 --> 44:44.847
You know, sort of on the sly,
if you know what I mean?

44:44.849 --> 44:46.849
That's not possible, sir.

44:46.851 --> 44:48.851
STAN: Don't you miss it?

44:48.853 --> 44:52.989
The thrill of the game
when the buzzer goes!

44:52.991 --> 44:54.590
You have a chance
to help these boys

44:54.592 --> 44:57.694
with more than just basketball.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.666
I don't think you understand.

45:03.668 --> 45:08.004
What you're asking would go
against everything we stand for.

45:08.006 --> 45:10.106
Well, we didn't realize that.

45:10.642 --> 45:12.141
Uh... Sorry.

45:12.143 --> 45:14.410
They could send us home.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.846
Really?
Yes.

45:17.816 --> 45:20.116
I'm sorry, sir.

45:28.827 --> 45:30.827
Well, that went well.
Mmm.

45:33.998 --> 45:35.431
Can you believe them?

45:35.433 --> 45:37.500
Asking us to be
disobedient like that.

45:37.502 --> 45:39.368
Yeah.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.604
Wait, you're not
thinking about it?

45:41.606 --> 45:44.640
No! No, no way,
of course not.

45:44.642 --> 45:47.610
I mean, you've got to admit
it's a great opportunity.

45:47.612 --> 45:48.978
For what?

45:48.980 --> 45:51.080
Think of the doors
this could open for us.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.749
Like with Brett and Elspeth.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.784
The only reason we got
invited in was because of...

45:54.786 --> 45:56.185
This is different.

45:56.187 --> 46:00.790
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
This is bigger!

46:00.792 --> 46:02.759
This is the Olympic team.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.360
Imagine all the people
we could reach.

46:04.362 --> 46:07.163
No more being hosed off lawns.
No more doors in the face.

46:07.165 --> 46:09.866
Even if you're right,
President Bingham said no.

46:09.868 --> 46:12.335
"Find, teach, baptize"
is what he said.

46:12.337 --> 46:14.003
You're prodding at a
tiger in its cage here.

46:14.005 --> 46:15.471
We should be sharing our skills.

46:15.473 --> 46:19.175
Basketball, it can
break down barriers for us.

46:19.177 --> 46:21.344
I'm going to talk to President Bingham.
Are you crazy?

46:21.346 --> 46:23.713
Condie, we're being disobedient
just by being here.

46:23.715 --> 46:25.715
(CHUCKLES) Just relax, okay?

46:25.717 --> 46:29.085
President Bingham, he's
really just a teddy bear.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.554
Yeah, but Sister
Bingham's like a dragon.

46:31.556 --> 46:33.456
She's really scary.

46:36.561 --> 46:37.794
CONDIE: <i>At the moment,</i>

46:37.796 --> 46:39.061
we're just these
strange Americans

46:39.063 --> 46:40.596
who knock on people's
doors, but...

46:40.598 --> 46:43.132
But they love sport and they're
crazy for the Olympics.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.400
If we help them with this,

46:44.402 --> 46:45.868
we can break down
so many barriers.

46:45.870 --> 46:47.870
We'll be a part
of their community.

46:47.872 --> 46:50.406
Elder Condie, your
enthusiasm is admirable,

46:50.408 --> 46:52.141
but it's misguided.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.111
You need to re-channel all that
enthusiasm into your missionary work.

46:55.113 --> 46:56.646
I have been, President Bingham.

46:56.648 --> 46:58.114
Every day we go out tracting,

46:58.116 --> 46:59.749
and I can tell you firsthand

46:59.751 --> 47:02.385
that getting our message
across is that much easier

47:02.387 --> 47:05.288
when there's a point of
connection, like basketball.

47:05.290 --> 47:06.756
There's this young boy, Brett...

47:06.758 --> 47:08.858
Elder Condie,

47:08.860 --> 47:10.860
if you wanted to play
basketball so much,

47:10.862 --> 47:12.428
you should have
stayed in college.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.997
We are not a basketball team,
I am not your coach.

47:14.999 --> 47:16.719
No, I understand that,
sir, but...

47:16.868 --> 47:19.135
No buts.

47:19.137 --> 47:21.938
We have but one purpose
and one purpose only.

47:21.940 --> 47:27.176
We cannot do our work if we are
distracted by playing sports.

47:27.178 --> 47:31.013
Now, gentlemen, let this be the
last time we talk of this matter.

47:56.507 --> 47:58.174
Are you okay?

49:10.581 --> 49:13.282
Brethren, Elder Tanner
passed this on to me

49:13.284 --> 49:16.185
from his good friend,
Brother Condie.

49:17.121 --> 49:18.521
Missionary work is hard enough

49:18.523 --> 49:22.425
without us making it any harder.

49:22.427 --> 49:25.661
We send our fine young men
out into the mission field.

49:25.663 --> 49:28.631
And we have an opportunity
to assist them

49:28.633 --> 49:32.134
to bring others into
the arms of the Lord.

49:35.306 --> 49:38.307
And that is exactly
what I intend to do.

49:44.682 --> 49:48.684
Elder Condie, you must
have prayed very hard.

49:48.686 --> 49:53.155
Salt Lake has proposed that we
put a basketball team together

49:53.157 --> 49:55.224
in order to help
the Australians.

49:55.226 --> 49:58.294
And I'm putting you
in charge of it.

49:58.296 --> 50:00.396
We'll do whatever
you ask of us, sir.

50:00.398 --> 50:03.265
I want to make it absolutely
clear from the outset

50:03.267 --> 50:06.235
that there will be
certain parameters.

50:06.237 --> 50:07.837
Elders are not to be distracted

50:07.839 --> 50:10.339
from their missionary work.

50:10.341 --> 50:13.809
You will be given one
day a week to practice.

50:13.811 --> 50:16.445
I want you to work closely
together with Elder Burt

50:16.447 --> 50:19.548
to handpick the best team
from the mission.

50:21.919 --> 50:23.719
Don't let me down.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.964
Johnson was at BYU. Where's
he serving at the moment?

50:34.966 --> 50:37.600
He's in Adelaide. But he
goes home in a few weeks.

50:37.602 --> 50:40.569
Dang. West and Grant
were at the U.

50:40.571 --> 50:42.605
Grant's in Tasmania.

50:42.607 --> 50:44.573
Elder Garn was a starter
at Sugar City, Idaho.

50:44.575 --> 50:47.309
Oh, yeah, I remember playing against him.
That guy is fast.

50:47.311 --> 50:48.744
Frodsham. He's a good
all-around sportsman.

50:48.746 --> 50:51.280
He played at BYU.
He's tough as nails, too.

50:51.282 --> 50:53.149
Elder Hull, sit up straight.

50:53.151 --> 50:57.553
That is not a footrest and this
is not a Chinese bathhouse.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.721
Do up your tie.

51:00.258 --> 51:04.727
(SIGHS) So, are you elders
staying for dinner, then?

51:04.729 --> 51:07.663
We hadn't planned to, so please
don't go to any trouble for us.

51:07.665 --> 51:09.465
SISTER BINGHAM:
Well, I'm planning for you

51:09.467 --> 51:13.569
and I already have,
so it's settled.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.504
I still think all of
this is a silly idea,

51:15.506 --> 51:17.787
but if President McKay
thinks we should,

51:18.676 --> 51:20.643
then I will support it.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.414
Oh! And don't forget
Elder Kimball.

51:25.416 --> 51:27.816
He was a star at
Provo High School.

51:39.063 --> 51:40.896
BINGHAM:
Let me be quite clear.

51:40.898 --> 51:44.567
You are first and
foremost missionaries.

51:45.536 --> 51:48.137
You'll manage your time well,

51:48.139 --> 51:50.739
but if your work should suffer,

51:50.741 --> 51:53.442
then you'll be relieved
of this assignment.

51:55.146 --> 51:57.480
Basketball, in and of itself,

51:57.482 --> 52:01.617
doesn't convert
people to the gospel.

52:01.619 --> 52:06.188
So always remember who you are
and what you stand for.

52:08.025 --> 52:09.525
Yes, sir.

52:17.869 --> 52:21.537
When you guard me, you want to
stand a little closer if you can.

52:21.539 --> 52:23.472
Yeah, and keep low.
Okay.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.441
You'll see
which way I'm going to cut.

52:27.211 --> 52:29.178
Good, that's it, well done.

52:30.715 --> 52:33.315
Halt. If you spread your
hands wider on the ball,

52:33.317 --> 52:34.483
it's easier to control.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.163
I don't need any help from you.

52:36.187 --> 52:37.720
Okay.

52:37.722 --> 52:41.257
STAN: Hey, come on.
Come, boys. Time out.

52:41.259 --> 52:42.591
Let's just have a spell, fellas.

52:42.593 --> 52:45.394
Can you try and
put into practice

52:45.396 --> 52:46.695
what it is that
they're telling us?

52:46.697 --> 52:48.164
We don't...
They're here to help us!

52:48.166 --> 52:49.665
We don't need these guys.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.267
Yes, we do, Jim.

52:51.269 --> 52:53.869
We can't run to the Yanks every
time we need our necks saved.

52:53.871 --> 52:56.205
It was bad enough
during the bloody war.

52:58.242 --> 53:00.476
So what can we do
to improve ourselves?

53:00.478 --> 53:02.578
Playing basketball is one thing.

53:02.580 --> 53:04.947
How you live your life
is another.

53:04.949 --> 53:08.584
All I'm saying to you guys, if
you're smoking, if you're drinking,

53:08.586 --> 53:11.587
you're crucifying your bodies
and wasting your life.

53:11.589 --> 53:15.157
You don't see us running up
court gasping for air, do you?

53:15.159 --> 53:17.993
Hey! Go back
and join your team.

53:17.995 --> 53:19.461
I don't need sermons,

53:19.463 --> 53:21.983
and I don't need them to
tell me how to live my life.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.533
I think you do, Jim,

53:24.535 --> 53:27.615
'cause you're not doing a
very good job of it yourself.

53:28.272 --> 53:31.373
Go back and join
your team. Please.

53:36.948 --> 53:38.847
Anyway, I've seen you all doing the shots.
That's great.

53:38.849 --> 53:40.783
You've got
the two-handed set shot,

53:40.785 --> 53:44.253
but we really want to start
focusing on the jump shot.

53:44.255 --> 53:45.487
And the point of the jump

53:45.489 --> 53:47.022
is to shoot from
a higher position

53:47.024 --> 53:48.591
to make it more difficult
for the defender to block.

53:48.593 --> 53:50.673
It also lowers
the angle of the basket.

53:51.162 --> 53:52.861
So let's try some.

married to me.

It's a waste of time.

(CRICKETS CHIRP)

54:46.217 --> 54:49.051
So the state team invite us to
play in a city two hours away,

54:49.053 --> 54:52.454
and we have to hitchhike
while the others drive?

54:52.456 --> 54:54.923
How did we draw the short straw?

54:54.925 --> 54:58.445

to meet people.

butt by a snake?

55:22.320 --> 55:24.453
I'll hold.

55:24.455 --> 55:26.355
I think we should split up.

55:26.357 --> 55:29.325
Be a lot easier
to pick up two than four.

55:29.327 --> 55:30.726
Good idea.
We'll run ahead

55:30.728 --> 55:33.562

have them pick us up.

55:57.521 --> 55:59.921
Don't you miss your family?

56:01.258 --> 56:03.525
Yeah, I do.

56:55.646 --> 56:57.579
What about yours?

56:57.581 --> 57:00.883
Every year my dad would get a
turkey before Thanksgiving,

57:00.885 --> 57:05.154
and my brother would attach
himself to it, claim it as a pet.

57:05.156 --> 57:07.423
He didn't realize
we were eating his pet

all this way for nothing?

Well done, Condie, that's another
fine mess you got us into.

you'd be interested

game up at the prison.

Who would we play?

them into a team,

59:29.667 --> 59:31.099
and we play in the local league.

59:31.101 --> 59:33.001

were coming to Bendigo,

59:33.003 --> 59:36.004

will freak out.

any group of people

We're here. We got
nothing else to do.

You know, I saw
a James Cagney film once

where the prisoners had shivs
and stabbed each other.

We'll play on one condition.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:15.410
We get a hot meal.

The opportunity was there,

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.825

what I thought was right.

BINGHAM:
What you thought was right.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:14.362
Elder Condie,
I put my faith in you

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:15.464
to make good choices.

01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:17.933
This was not one of them.

01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:19.634
Did you even consider the danger

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.236
of what might have
happened there?

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.338
Sir, it's not like
we got stabbed.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.441
Sir, there were guards
with us at all time.

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:29.444
Elder Condie, that is
hardly the point.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.913
This game could set
the Church back years

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.248
if word gets out.

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:37.719
Now, these shenanigans must end.

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:41.089
Or you'll find yourself
door-knocking in the Outback.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.492
I doubt they play
basketball out there.

01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:49.297
Yes, sir.

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:52.234
Mmm.

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.804
These things are amazing.

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.141
How can he not see it?

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:02.244
I can't think of a better way
for them to accept us.

01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:04.346
Otherwise, what's
the point of being here?

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:08.250
You know, Condie...

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:10.685
At the start, I was just
going along with you

01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:12.968
because you were my companion.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:15.157
But after the prison match,

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:18.679
one of the inmates asked
me to teach him about God.

01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:23.198
I think you're
onto something here,

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.320
and it's kind of exciting.

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:33.575

don't want some?

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:36.511

It's really good.

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:43.718
So, the Olympic Committee
won't allow nations

to play each other before
the actual games begin.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.391
So, they want to put
together a tournament,

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:53.528
where countries can play
you boys or some local teams

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.932
to get some match practice
before the Olympics.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:04:00.335
Us, play against
the Olympic teams?

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:02.604
If you can give them
some good warm-up games,

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.374
it makes for a better spectacle.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:12.147
We'll have to run it past
President Bingham first.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:15.016
I'm not exactly his
favorite person right now.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:17.886
Wouldn't you want to go up
against the best in the world?

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:19.988
See how good you can be?

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.350
And see us get our trash kicked?

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.159
Oh, no, son.

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:26.261
No, you're
as good as I've ever seen.

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:30.765
We'll ask. But don't
hold your breath.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:32.033

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:34.202
Come here.

You boys have got a fan.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.374
Excuse me, sir, could I
please have an autograph?

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.409
Sure. Do you play?

really just started.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.614

a blessing in your life.

It's nice to meet you, Lindsay.

01:04:57.761 --> 01:04:59.160
Thanks.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:11.139
Don't worry. If Bingham's going
to flip, I'll take the heat.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:15.310
No, you won't.
We're companions.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:17.792
I'm with you all the way.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:23.919
What is it, my dear? (SIGHS)

The inmates have asked that we
send missionaries there to teach,

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:34.396
at the prison!

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:40.168
Apparently, all this
basketball nonsense

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:43.071
may have its merits after all.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:47.976
You have always chosen the right

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:50.111
and taken care of the underdog.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:52.514
And the man I know
would never be afraid

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:55.650
to admit when he's
been wrong before.

They are our boys.

these games are all about.

<i>"Play ball," said the referee!</i>

go down to the wire.</i>

01:28:02.578 --> 01:28:04.845

But we must get possession.

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:10.684
Hull, Kimball.

01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:13.353
There are no plays
that I can tell you from now.

01:28:13.355 --> 01:28:15.989
All right,
now it's all instinctive.

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:21.128
Let's go, Yankees!
Come on, come on!

down to three fit men on the court.</i>

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.334

that these two countries</i>

01:28:27.336 --> 01:28:28.802
<i>were allies during the war.</i>

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.971
<i>This is what you'd expect
from the Russians.</i>

01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.450
Come on.

01:28:46.255 --> 01:28:47.754

We played that game
fair and square!

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:04.357
You can't have an extra free throw!
"Travel"?

01:31:04.359 --> 01:31:06.493
We'll protest, son.

01:31:06.495 --> 01:31:09.362
Protest to who, Ken?

01:31:09.364 --> 01:31:11.631
We're here
to give them practice,

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:12.933
and that's what we did.

01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:32.786
When I'm wrong, I admit it.

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:35.889
Good game, Condie.
