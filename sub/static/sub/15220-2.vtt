00:23.720 --> 00:25.800
Theorizing that one could
time-travel

00:25.840 --> 00:27.400
within his own lifetime,

00:27.600 --> 00:30.520
Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into
the Quantum Leap Accelerator

00:30.640 --> 00:32.080
and vanished.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.240
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.520
facing mirror images
that were not his own,

00:42.840 --> 00:44.880
and driven by
an unknown force

00:45.040 --> 00:47.360
to change history
for the better.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.120
His only guide on
this journey is Al,

00:50.320 --> 00:52.240
an observer from his own time,

00:52.480 --> 00:54.400
who appears in
the form of a hologram

00:54.520 --> 00:56.480
that only Sam
can see and hear.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.840
And so Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:01.200 --> 01:03.880
striving to put right
what once went wrong,

01:04.040 --> 01:06.520
and hoping each time
that his next leap

01:07.280 --> 01:09.000
will be the leap home.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.080
Sam, you scared
10 years out of me.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.120
Mom!

01:38.720 --> 01:40.800
Last week on Quantum Leap.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.600
I love you, Dad.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.360
My brother, Tom, comes
home for Thanksgiving

01:48.400 --> 01:49.720
before shipping
out to Vietnam.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.760
Al, I can save Tom.

01:56.040 --> 01:56.960
Tom?

01:58.240 --> 01:59.840
Ah, hello, little brother.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.240
I don't want to believe you.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.200
I don't want to believe
you know the future.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.080
Because if you do,
Tom is gonna die.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.720
I don't want my brother
to die in Vietnam.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.200
What happened?

02:17.560 --> 02:19.160
Sam told her Tom
is going to die.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.800
You are not changing anything.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.920
Your father still dies in '72.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.000
Tom still gets
killed in Vietnam.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.680
You are not
changing their future, Sam.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.040
All you're doing is making
their present miserable.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.480
But why can I save strangers
and not the people I love?

02:32.560 --> 02:33.560
Just give me one day.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.560
A day?

02:34.640 --> 02:35.720
April 8.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.520
The day Tom is killed.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.160
Find the deepest hole you can,

02:39.240 --> 02:40.720
and crawl into it
for 24 hours.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.160
Oh, what the hell.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.160
You win that basketball
game tomorrow, and on April 8

02:45.200 --> 02:49.720
I will crawl into the deepest,
thickest, concrete bunker in Vietnam.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.160
Hoo-yah!

02:56.240 --> 02:57.200
Come on, Sam.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.400
Bye, Dad.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.560
My brother!
What about my brother, Tom?

03:15.640 --> 03:18.880
I'm sorry, Sam.
He's still killed in Vietnam.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.040
Sam!

03:20.480 --> 03:21.640
Hoo-yah!

03:21.880 --> 03:23.320
Tom!

03:29.360 --> 03:30.600
Tom!

03:49.080 --> 03:51.080
We got him. Checking this one.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.120
Tom?

03:56.400 --> 03:58.360
Damn, Magic!

04:00.480 --> 04:02.160
How'd you know
they were there?

04:03.280 --> 04:04.360
Oh, boy.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.880
Yeah,
even though I was only three,

05:29.960 --> 05:31.840
it's just as clear as
if it happened yesterday.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.120
It was Saturday.
I know it was Saturday 'cause

05:34.160 --> 05:36.880
Dad always inspected
the battalion on Saturday.

05:36.960 --> 05:37.920
Mmm.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.320
Grimwald. General Max Grimwald
was your father?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.840
Oh!
Big shoes to fill, Colonel.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.320
Mine are a size
and a half bigger.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.560
So, there I was
this Saturday

05:50.640 --> 05:52.360
on the reviewing stand
with my dad.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.920
The base photographer
snapped my picture.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.840
He caught me saluting the
colors as they passed in review.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.800
It was so damn cute they
put it in the base newspaper.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.440
That was 1938.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.640
25 years later, another
3-year-old did the same thing.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.360
I'll be damned.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.760
Yeah, I know.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.280
It just never
seemed fair somehow.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.560
I mean, I did it first, all
I got was the base newspaper.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.680
Hell, John-John's salute
made the cover of LIFE.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.080
It was unreal.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.600
In the space of a leap,
I'd gone from

06:26.640 --> 06:28.840
the depths of despair
to the summit of hope.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.560
He was alive.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.400
My brother Tom
was still alive

06:32.560 --> 06:34.120
and I was in
Vietnam with him.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.040
What?

06:37.120 --> 06:38.640
I'm just glad
that we're all alive.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.640
Yeah, thanks to you.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.320
Never seen
anything like you, Magic.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.600
I've been in this
man's Navy 22 years.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.800
Roger that. 11 missions and all
I've had to patch is mosquito bites.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.240
Praise the Lord.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.080
Praise the Lord and Magic.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.440
I'll be dammed.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.160
Round eye. 12:00.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.120
He's coming to you.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.520
He's down.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.280
Hi, boys.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.000
Hi.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.240
Lt. Beckett?

07:54.320 --> 07:55.480
No, sir, I wouldn't say that.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.880
I'm Beckett, sir.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.560
Where do you think
you are, Lieutenant?

07:58.640 --> 07:59.800
Club Med?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.120
Tom, he's drowning.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.800
Who?
The water-skier.

08:02.880 --> 08:03.840
He hasn't come up, yet?

08:03.920 --> 08:04.760
No.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.760
It happens.

08:13.000 --> 08:13.960
Not to Blaster.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.480
He skied all the way
to Saigon once.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
On bare feet.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
That's gospel.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.680
Yeah.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.480
This is your fault, ma'am.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
My fault?

08:21.680 --> 08:22.600
That's right.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.680
Our pilot banked to see you.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.360
That slacked the rope
and wiped Blaster out.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.160
Well, do something,
Lieutenant.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.159
Sir.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.600
Go in after him.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.080
Sir, the Mekong's
thicker than mud pie.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.080
We can't see six inches
underwater.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.120
Well, you're Navy SEALs.
Hell, feel around.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.159
Sir, we're five miles
from the coast.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.520
The tide's going out. That means
there is a seven-knot current.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.720
Eight, sir. Eight-knot
current running, sir.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.160
By now Blaster's nowhere
near where he wiped out.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.400
In fact, by now,
Blaster's probably

08:55.320 --> 08:56.280
right about...

08:57.680 --> 08:58.640
...there.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.640
I'd like a word
with you, Lieutenant.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.400
Ahem. Yes, sir.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.840
Chief, let's get
these weapons cleaned

09:13.920 --> 09:15.000
and, uh, stand them down.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.080
Aye, aye, sir.
Let's move out, boys.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.680
You're Maggie Dawson. Right?

09:19.680 --> 09:20.960
Oh!

09:22.440 --> 09:23.560
In the flesh.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.760
First round of warm beers
is on me.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.720
Easy, boys.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.920
I'm going to forget
about that little joke,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.960
because you're coming
in off a hot mission.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.320
He was in the water
the whole time.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.400
What is it, Magic?

09:46.360 --> 09:47.720
Oh, well.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.040
Nothing, I guess.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.640
Like I was saying, I'm going
to forget about that joke

09:54.040 --> 09:55.840
because you're coming
in off a hot mission,

09:55.920 --> 09:57.720
because
we're fraternity brothers.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.760
I wasn't in a fraternity,
sir, I went to Annapolis.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.560
I went to West Point.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.320
I like to think
of us Academy men

10:05.480 --> 10:07.000
as fraternity brothers.
Don't you?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.720
Not during
the Army-Navy game, sir.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.800
Yeah, right.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.520
Lieutenant,

10:14.840 --> 10:16.360
I need your help.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.040
I've been
escorting Miss Dawson

10:18.120 --> 10:19.520
on an aerial tour
of the delta.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.760
Ouch, tough duty, sir.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.360
You'll have a chance to
find out for yourself.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.800
How's that?

10:33.640 --> 10:37.360
I've brought you some orders
from MACV-SOG. Very special op.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.240
And well,

10:40.280 --> 10:43.600
I promised Miss Dawson,
that she could go with you.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.000
Oh.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.760
They told me you had
green faces,

10:48.840 --> 10:50.200
webbed feet, and dripped.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.480
Oh, yeah?

10:51.560 --> 10:55.520
This, uh, this gyrene in Saigon
told me that you got the biggest,

10:55.600 --> 10:56.760
roundest...
Hey... hey!

10:57.320 --> 10:59.600
Sorry, ma'am.
He's on his third tour, ma'am.

10:59.680 --> 11:02.600
After three wars and five
insurrections, I'm used to it.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.200
I was just going to say

11:05.640 --> 11:07.320
he told me you
had the biggest,

11:07.440 --> 11:09.480
roundest camera
lens in Vietnam.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.960
That's called a fisheye.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.080
And if you boys are swapping
stories about the size of my lenses,

11:16.160 --> 11:17.560
I'm in trouble.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.400
Now, you can't slide
the barrel in

11:23.520 --> 11:26.320
unless the cocking
handle is cocked.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.360
Oh, boy, combat survival parties.
There's nothing like them.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.080
Course we didn't
have beer on board ship

11:35.920 --> 11:38.760
and we didn't have anyone
that looks like her either.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.960
You know she's got
the biggest, roundest...

11:43.080 --> 11:44.160
Camera lens in Vietnam.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.680
No.
I know.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.240
Oh, yeah, that...
Yeah. Yeah.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.720
Lens, too.
Come on.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.960
Magic, where you going?

11:55.800 --> 12:00.000
Uh, well, I figured since we had
a visitor, I ought to get a shower.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.720
Shower?

12:01.800 --> 12:02.720
Take a shower.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.200
Hey, I'm going.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.680
Beat you to it!

12:08.480 --> 12:10.160
I already had my shower.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.160
Want a beer?

12:13.360 --> 12:14.640
Uh.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.280
For starters.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.680
Thank you, Lord. Thanks.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.160
You'd think they'd never seen
a woman before.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.640
Well, they haven't seen
anything like Maggie Dawson,

12:28.720 --> 12:31.240
since they started
this tour five months ago.

12:32.160 --> 12:36.360
In December. Tom took a squad
to Vietnam in December of '69.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.360
I'm in Tom's squad, Al.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.120
I'm in my brother's squad
and he's still alive.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.840
Five months ago?

12:48.960 --> 12:50.080
This is April?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
April 7.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.520
Tom was killed on the eighth.

12:58.840 --> 12:59.800
Tomorrow.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.960
Don't wear any underwear.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.480
And don't button
the top button of your shorts.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.760
SEALs never wear
any underwear

13:32.840 --> 13:34.840
and never button the top
button of their shorts.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.760
I'm just telling you, so at
least you can look like a SEAL.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.280
Whatever it takes to
save my brother's life.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.880
Technically, you're not
here to save your brother.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.280
Don't give me that crap, Al.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.760
What, you want me to
lie to you

13:45.840 --> 13:48.560
or tell you the truth, so at least
you know what you're up against?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.160
Don't forget your gun,
you got to wear that.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.520
All right.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.400
You are a signalman second
class, Herbert Williams.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.320
But your buddies
all call you...

14:03.280 --> 14:04.840
Magic. Why?

14:05.600 --> 14:08.200
Well, because to the squad,
you are magic.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.000
Their first month in Nam,
everything went wrong.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.080
Missions failed.
Casualties were high.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.720
They thought they were jinxed.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.160
And then you joined.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.320
As you stepped
off the chopper,

14:19.400 --> 14:22.440
uh, Charlie started to
mortar the compound.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.440
Blew up the chopper and
everything within 50 meters of it.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.200
Everything, except you.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.520
You didn't even get a scratch.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.520
Then the next
day in the jungle,

14:31.680 --> 14:33.120
you tripped a booby trap.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.320
Damn thing
didn't even go off.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.680
So, they started
calling you Magic.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.640
They think
I'm their talisman?

14:39.800 --> 14:42.960
You are. They haven't taken a
casualty since you came aboard.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.000
Till tomorrow.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.840
Until tomorrow.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.600
Tomorrow, Dempsey and Shamoo
are wounded and, uh,

14:51.600 --> 14:53.160
your brother Tom is killed.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.320
And I'm not here
to change that?

14:55.440 --> 14:58.440
According to Ziggy, you're here
to see that the mission succeeds.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
What's the difference?

14:59.640 --> 15:02.280
Well, some guys get killed
on successful missions, Sam.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.640
Not on this mission.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.760
Now, just... just tell me
what I have to do.

15:07.680 --> 15:08.640
I don't know.

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
You don't know?

15:09.840 --> 15:12.080
All Ziggy's come up with
so far is a code name

15:12.240 --> 15:15.040
Operation Lazarus
and the casualty lists.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.480
Uh, I don't even
know the objective.

15:17.760 --> 15:21.000
The SEALs operations were all
classified top secret and...

15:21.040 --> 15:22.760
You've got top
secret clearance.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.440
And they took place
over 25 years ago.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.520
All the battle records are
buried in an old Pentagon computer

15:28.600 --> 15:30.920
and Ziggy's having trouble
interfacing with it.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.720
It's like trying to get
two members of the UN

15:33.800 --> 15:35.880
to talk without a translator.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.880
Well, you tell Ziggy he
better interface

15:37.960 --> 15:39.880
'cause I don't give a damn
about the mission.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.680
All I care about
is my brother, Al.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.400
And if I got to
shoot him in the leg

15:43.480 --> 15:45.880
to keep him from going
and being killed, I'll do it.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.160
What if he gets killed
when the slick taking him

15:48.240 --> 15:50.920
to the hospital to treat
his leg wound gets shot down?

15:51.560 --> 15:54.320
Until we know how Tom dies,
we won't be able to save him.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.200
Now listen, Lieutenant,

15:57.280 --> 15:58.800
with all the press
Maggie can give you,

15:58.880 --> 16:01.720
we're talking about
a Presidential citation here.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.440
There might even be a Navy
Cross for the Commanding Officer.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.040
Colonel, you can hang a
Medal of Honor around my neck,

16:07.120 --> 16:09.200
I still wouldn't take
a reporter on a mission.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.000
Especially a female reporter.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.000
If you gotta take one,
we're the best kind.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.600
She's got a point.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.760
Well, fortunately, ma'am,
I don't gotta take one.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.600
And not even colonels from
MACV-SOG can change that.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.480
Lieutenant, I've been on night
patrol with the Marines,

16:25.560 --> 16:29.120
in a tank with the Israelis, even
flew on a bombing raid over Haiphong.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.920
I can take it.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.120
I will bet you can,
but we can't.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.240
This is the SEAL squad, ma'am.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.200
We're so in tune
with each other that

16:40.240 --> 16:42.640
when Magic gets gas,
I break wind.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.680
Not eloquently put,
Lieutenant, but I get the point.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.800
So that I, uh, I don't
waste the trip,

16:51.880 --> 16:53.640
can I stick around a few days

16:53.720 --> 16:55.400
and take some pics of
you guys in camp?

16:55.560 --> 16:57.680
I don't see why that
wouldn't be acceptable.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.440
Good. Where do I bunk?

17:01.760 --> 17:02.960
My place?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.200
Magic.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.839
Fix Miss Dawson a cot
in the communications bunker.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.800
Oh, okay.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.319
Aye, aye, sir.
Aye, aye, sir.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.000
Communications bunker?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.920
Uh, look for
a bunker with a bunch

17:14.000 --> 17:15.640
of whip antennas
on the top of it.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.400
Magic, I got a chieu hoi
waiting for me by my chopper.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.599
Chieu hoi?

17:21.680 --> 17:24.160
Chieu hoi is a VC guerrilla
that joined our side.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.720
Personally,
I never trust them.

17:25.839 --> 17:26.960
Yeah, send her in, please.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.200
Unless they're cute.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.520
Her?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.880
Do you repeat everything?

17:30.960 --> 17:32.280
Do I repeat everything?

17:32.360 --> 17:35.280
Magic, are your ears still
ringing from that firefight?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.640
Yes, yes,
a... a little.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.120
Have Doc check them out.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.160
Okay.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.400
Aye, aye, sir.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.120
Aye, aye...
Aye, sir.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.640
I envy you, Lieutenant.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.480
Maggie wants to go
on that mission so bad,

17:53.520 --> 17:55.720
she'll make a dog in
heat look like a nun.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.280
Oh, boy.
What's the mission, Colonel?

17:58.320 --> 17:59.400
It's a beaut.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.640
I wasn't kidding about those
citations and medals, either.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.840
MACV-SOG calls it
Operation Lazarus.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.240
The target is 10
clicks upriver. Mai Choi.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.920
You send for me, Colonel?

18:09.240 --> 18:10.960
Titi,
this is Lt. Beckett.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.800
He'll lead the SEAL team that
you take to the village tomorrow.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.920
43, 44,

18:19.560 --> 18:24.200
45, 46, 47...

18:27.640 --> 18:29.840
Tom never talked about
what SEALs did off duty.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.680
And after a few hours
with Bravo squad, I knew why.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.440
Mom would have had a cow.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.160
You lose, Choo Choo.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.800
Green face not human.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.560
Never bet a thirsty SEAL
he can't do something.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.280
That was inspirational.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.400
You think that was something,
Miss Dawson,

18:53.480 --> 18:54.760
you should see
what Magic can do.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.560
Yeah, Magic's truly inhuman.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.000
Magic double-jointed.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.840
Double-jointed?

19:00.880 --> 19:03.280
There's no such thing as
double-jointed, Choo Choo.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.320
You double-jointed?
Ask any of my girls.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.280
This is getting interesting.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.680
What is this
thing you can do?

19:12.760 --> 19:13.960
Show her, Magic.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.560
Shamoo, you know he can't.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.320
Why?
It's classified, top secret.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.760
Bet she's got
security clearance, don't you?

19:21.840 --> 19:24.560
Signed by Westmoreland,
twice.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.720
I guess it'll be all right.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.400
You just do your good
morning darlings, first.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.080
Good morning darlings?

19:32.360 --> 19:35.240
Yeah, you know,
to stretch his groin muscles.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.400
Okay.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.400
Physiological necessity.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.240
These good morning darlings
wouldn't by any chance

19:42.320 --> 19:44.120
be a two man exercise,
would they?

19:44.200 --> 19:47.200
You know, they do require
two consenting adults.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.640
One of which is a female.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.720
She knows the exercise.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.080
I should.
I've had enough practice.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.160
Ziggy bypassed
the old Pentagon computer

20:05.200 --> 20:07.640
and went to data fusion with
The New York Times library.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.320
That's great.
Thanks.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.440
I thought it was
rather humorous myself.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.040
He dug up a photo story
that Maggie did

20:14.120 --> 20:16.960
on a sapper attack
here tonight.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.400
Sappers?

20:19.880 --> 20:22.120
They slipped in from the river
around midnight.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.960
They blew up the ammo dump
and they get

20:24.040 --> 20:25.800
Deke's helicopter
just as it lifts off.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.400
Killed him instantly.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.360
Now wait... wait,
before you say anything.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.160
I had Ziggy run some numbers.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.360
There's a 52 percent chance that
that's what you're here to do.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.200
To save Col. Deke Grimwald.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.560
But if that's true,

20:40.520 --> 20:44.360
then right after the attack,
you're gonna leap out.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.120
And you won't be around
tomorrow to save Tom.

20:57.880 --> 20:58.960
Dempsey.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.000
Yeah?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.920
Sappers are coming in
from the river at midnight.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.440
Tough decision, kid.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.600
Sappers!

21:10.880 --> 21:11.920
How could he know?

21:12.400 --> 21:13.960
That's why we call him Magic.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.000
I'm gonna make
three fake insertions.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.160
I'll make one before and
two after I drop your team.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.360
Titi says the road
is booby-trapped,

21:20.400 --> 21:21.720
so you're gonna
have to use the river,

21:21.800 --> 21:23.960
and the rice paddies
when you approach the village.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.120
How long to get there, Titi?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.440
Two, maybe three hour.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.880
Okay. Now,
can't we insert any closer?

21:29.320 --> 21:30.960
Maj. Quan most vigilant.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.920
Leave village if he hear
American helicopter.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.680
Sir, Magic says sappers
are crossing the river.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.440
How the hell
does he know that?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.920
Magic's got a sixth sense.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.600
Yeah, you could call me that.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.400
If he says sappers are coming,
Colonel, sappers are coming.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.440
All right fire up the Dragon,
I'll contact you on TAC 2.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.400
No, sir.
I want to set up an ambush.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.600
If they see you flying up,
they'll know we're on to them.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.200
Doc, alert the Marines.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.440
Tell them I'm setting up an
ambush. Slip into the bunkers.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.800
Chief, set them.
Preacher,

21:55.880 --> 21:57.680
take the trench
by the communications bunker.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.560
Blaster, cover the north side
of the river.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.040
Shamoo, south trench.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.440
With the Lieutenant's
permission, I'll man the minigun.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.120
No,
I need you on the claymores.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.120
Magic, you man the minigun.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.480
Don't shoot until you hear
the claymores blow.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.880
It's showtime.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.560
Aye, aye, sir.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.720
Shh.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.840
Should be coming any minute.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.880
You better turn
the battery on, plug it in.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.480
When you fire,
shoot in short bursts.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.480
This thing shoots
6,000 rounds a minute.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.320
Too dark for picture.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.840
Honey, this film can get exposure
where the sun don't shine.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.000
I can't see a damn thing.

23:04.840 --> 23:06.000
Stand by, south side.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.240
What do you got, Chief?

23:13.680 --> 23:14.640
Damn.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.240
Round eyes.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.560
If she tries to
leave again, shoot.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.800
They should hit any sec.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.760
That's what you said
two minutes ago.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.240
I'm telling you,
there's nothing out there

24:09.320 --> 24:10.880
except Magic's imagination.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.200
Hoo-Yah!

24:19.880 --> 24:21.200
I can't believe it,

24:21.280 --> 24:25.120
you saved that ungrateful
nozzle's life and he mocks you.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.840
Who cares, Al?
I'm still here.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.120
I changed history
and I didn't leap.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.480
You did change history.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.160
But I'm dammed if
I know how you did it.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.000
Well, maybe the sappers saw us
and... and they called off the attack.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.880
It's too dark for them to see
you. It had to be something else.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.040
What difference does it make?
We did it.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.480
If we can save Deke,
we can save Tom.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.280
Thank God!

24:49.360 --> 24:51.160
Tell Madame Diem
to lighten up.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.400
Is over?

24:55.560 --> 24:56.760
Is over.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.520
I'll bet you
a month's per diem,

25:03.600 --> 25:05.360
she would have shot me
if I tried to leave.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.920
No bet.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.840
Uh,

25:10.120 --> 25:12.000
listen,
I'll... I'll only be a minute.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.760
Uh, Tom, the lieutenant
asked me to

25:15.120 --> 25:17.640
secure the radio net.
So I gotta...

25:18.240 --> 25:19.680
There's nothing to it, Sam.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.280
SEAL One is monitoring a tactical
frequency on that transmitter.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.640
So you just call
them up, and... and you say

25:25.680 --> 25:27.920
you're securing
from battle stations.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.080
SEAL One this...

25:40.320 --> 25:41.280
Bravo.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.560
This is Bravo. Over.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.800
I hope my getting ready
for bed

25:45.840 --> 25:47.160
doesn't bother you.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.640
Uh, no, no, no, not at all.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.560
Ahem.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.440
Ha-ha, no, no, no,
I don't think so.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.120
SEAL One, this is Bravo.
Over.

25:58.160 --> 26:01.680
Oh, wow!

26:03.280 --> 26:05.000
Al.
Huh?

26:05.160 --> 26:06.120
Al?

26:06.200 --> 26:07.680
Uh, yeah, it's a code name,

26:07.760 --> 26:10.360
um, and they don't seem
to be answering to it.

26:11.920 --> 26:12.840
Huh?

26:13.560 --> 26:14.520
They don't?

26:16.880 --> 26:21.120
Let me see. 47.30.
That doesn't seem right.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.440
Try 41.15.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.720
Oh, shoot!

26:28.680 --> 26:30.440
She put her jammies on.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.360
SEAL One this is Bravo. Over.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.600
Bravo, SEAL One.
What's shaking, baby?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.240
Those sappers hit?

26:40.880 --> 26:43.000
Uh, no. Uh, negative.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.520
Um, we're securing
from battle stations.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.880
Sleep tight
and don't let Charlie bite.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.320
SEAL One, out.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.920
Okay, over, out.

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
Here.

27:02.360 --> 27:06.080
To those poor, magnificent
bastards you're going after.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.480
I don't follow you.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.800
The Air Cav earache.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.400
He must have told
her the mission.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.360
The guy deserves to
be court-martialed.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.800
Col. Grimwald brief you
on tomorrow's mission?

27:16.680 --> 27:18.840
Mr. West Point? No way.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.600
It was someone higher up.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.080
But how I got
the info isn't important.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.840
What I do with it is.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.880
I'm a photojournalist, Magic.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.600
A damn good one.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.720
And there's not
a good journalist

27:31.760 --> 27:33.640
who wouldn't sell
their soul for a Pulitzer.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.680
Since your mission tomorrow
is Pulitzer material,

27:37.200 --> 27:39.960
I want you to tell
your Lt. Beckett

27:40.040 --> 27:42.920
that you've got that
magic feeling about me.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.760
You think you'll bring
us luck on the mission?

27:49.040 --> 27:50.120
Uh-huh.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.040
In exchange for what?

27:54.640 --> 27:55.600
Your soul?

27:57.560 --> 27:59.240
Not just my soul, baby.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.280
Ah,

28:15.360 --> 28:18.200
woman, you're picking
the wrong man.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.560
What do you say?

28:23.640 --> 28:24.600
Deal.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.560
Sam, I am the one who thinks
with his glands. Not you.

28:42.880 --> 28:46.160
Why... How'd you get
the info on the sappers?

28:47.280 --> 28:49.760
Uh, how'd I get... Well, it
was... it was very simple.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.520
Uh, Maggie filed
a story in the newspaper.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.840
So Maggie goes on this
mission, she's gonna do a story

28:59.920 --> 29:02.800
and then Ziggy can pull it out
of the newspaper files.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.120
Hey, that's brilliant, Sam.
That's brilliant.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.120
It's stupid.
It's really stupid.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.560
I thought you were
smarter than that, Magic.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.120
I swear to you, Tom.
Maggie is vital

29:14.200 --> 29:15.360
to the success
of this mission.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.640
I can't explain how I know.
I just do.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.120
You sound like my brother.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.200
I do?

29:24.160 --> 29:27.360
He gets these
feelings about the future.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.400
When I was home
last Thanksgiving,

29:29.520 --> 29:31.240
he scared
the hell out of my folks.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.040
Kept telling us that I was
going to die over here

29:35.560 --> 29:36.880
on April 8.

29:39.960 --> 29:43.400
Made me promise to crawl into the
deepest, darkest hole I could find

29:43.440 --> 29:44.800
until that day was over.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.680
Today is, um,

29:47.920 --> 29:48.800
April 8.

29:48.880 --> 29:49.840
I know.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.880
But, any hole around here over
three feet deep fills with water.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.200
You know,
you made a promise.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.320
Don't you think you ought to
try and keep it?

30:00.720 --> 30:02.200
I got a mission to lead.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.840
Now,
are you sure about Maggie?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.080
I'd stake my life on it.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.440
Good, because that's
what you'll be doing.

30:11.080 --> 30:14.760
Staking your life on
it, Magic, and ours.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.840
Once we were in the air,
I expected history to change.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.080
For Al to appear with
Maggie's story on the mission

30:30.160 --> 30:32.520
so I'd know how to make it
a success and save Tom.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.160
But we'd made
the fake insertion

30:34.240 --> 30:35.680
and there was
still no sign of Al.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.160
I was starting to sweat
and it wasn't the humidity.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.840
We're coming up on the LZ.
One minute.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.000
One minute. Last time.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.920
Preacher and I go
for Maj. Quan's hooch.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.120
Take out his bodyguards and
capture him alive if possible.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.960
If not,
praise the Lord and...

30:51.040 --> 30:53.800
Blaster and I neutralize the
guards at the target hooch.

30:53.960 --> 30:57.360
Magic and I cover the rear and
call in the 7th Cavalry if needed.

30:57.720 --> 30:58.800
Roger.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.760
And you, Miss Dawson,
are free to cover

31:00.880 --> 31:02.760
this mission any
way you see fit,

31:02.800 --> 31:05.720
as long as you do
not leave the chopper.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.200
Aye, aye, sir.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.800
Skipper, don't you think it's about
time you told us what's in that hooch?

31:10.880 --> 31:12.080
I've kind of
been saving that.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.320
Yeah, we noticed.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.840
Two,
maybe three American POWs.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.080
All right.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.800
I told you it was
Pulitzer material.

31:23.760 --> 31:24.960
But not for her.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.440
POWs, Al.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.680
Who do not get rescued.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.960
What went wrong?

31:34.080 --> 31:35.440
We still don't know.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.520
Find Maggie's story?

31:38.800 --> 31:40.360
She never filed it.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.120
She was killed
on this mission.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.960
It was happening again.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.920
But not like it
did the first time.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.680
Then only Tom was killed.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.920
Now, Maggie was joining him and
only God knew how many others.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.360
Maybe everyone
on the chopper.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.360
Maybe I'd killed them all.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.120
I know you want to scream.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.680
I know you want to tell Tom
to call off the mission.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.160
But he's not gonna do it.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.360
Even if he believed you,
he's gonna push on.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.240
He'll get Doc to sedate you
and he'll leave you behind.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.200
You don't want that
to happen, do you?

32:22.760 --> 32:25.000
Just remember you've got
an ace in the hole.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.480
Me.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.840
All right.
Move out. Come on.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.520
Move!

33:07.120 --> 33:09.240
LZ 3 coming up in one minute.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.160
Colonel,
does this bird have a potty?

33:13.840 --> 33:15.760
We just go out the door,
Maggie.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.840
Yeah, well, I'm not equipped
to do that.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.280
Uh, how about a minute on
the ground at this next LZ?

33:21.360 --> 33:22.560
I can't do that.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.160
Come on, Colonel.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.520
Where's your
sense of chivalry?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.400
I gotta go
and I sure as hell don't want

33:28.480 --> 33:30.600
to do it in front of
these kids back here.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.360
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.720
MK-26s.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.040
Must have stolen
from the ARVNs.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.000
Or bought it.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.040
Sappers, sir.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.400
Probably going
out on a mission.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.920
Take the weapons.
Leave the rest.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.720
You know her?
No.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.640
We gotta make that
next insertion, Colonel.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.320
Maggie!

35:37.080 --> 35:38.680
Damn!
She ain't coming, Colonel.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.240
She ain't coming.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.840
Village close.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.080
Magic. Doc.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.480
Deploy here.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.480
Tom.

36:05.640 --> 36:06.600
What?

36:34.320 --> 36:37.640
This is stupid, Maggie.
Stupid.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.760
But it's how you
win a Pulitzer.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.080
Sam! I found the POWs.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.800
The VC are leading them down
a trail right over there.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.920
Al, look at this.

37:00.560 --> 37:03.160
Sam, there's only two guards.
You and Doc can free them.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.840
This radio is tuned to 47.30.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.280
That's the same
frequency the radio

37:06.320 --> 37:07.960
in the bunker
was tuned to last night.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.320
We took this radio
off the sappers, Al.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.800
47.30 is the frequency
they were using.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.720
The chieu hoi.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.720
She must have radioed them right
after Maggie left the bunker.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.600
She's leading them
straight into an ambush.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.440
I got to go warn Tom.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.040
You'll never
catch him in time.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.320
You've flipped Magic,
I'm going to sedate you.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.480
Al, help me.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.840
Get off my back, Charlie.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.320
We're gonna cut a booby trap.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.320
No, we won't.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.840
Trap! One right there.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.600
I've got a sixth sense.

38:17.680 --> 38:18.720
Village.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.560
Taking this road
got us here ahead

38:23.640 --> 38:24.640
of the squad,
but not by much.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.720
Charlie's laying for them on this
side of the river and in the village.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.760
So you better get on the horn
to Col. Custer

38:29.840 --> 38:31.280
'cause we're gonna
need the cavalry.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.280
What'll I say?

38:32.360 --> 38:33.280
Help!

38:51.480 --> 38:53.160
Hoo-Yah!

38:55.640 --> 38:59.000
Ambush! Ambush!
Pull back! Pull back!

39:38.920 --> 39:40.040
Get down.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.600
Ugh.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.920
She was going to kill you.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.680
Booby trap, Sam. Step over.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.520
Come on, Magic.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.080
Magic!
Maggie, no!

40:15.160 --> 40:16.240
Maggie, stop!

40:36.880 --> 40:38.360
Pulitzer.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.440
She can see me.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.120
You didn't kill her, Magic.

41:14.880 --> 41:19.560
She sure as hell didn't die the first
time April 8, 1970 rolled around.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.440
What are you talking about?

41:23.480 --> 41:25.800
No, but Tom did.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.760
Well, there it is, isn't it?

41:30.040 --> 41:31.960
I traded a life for a life.

41:35.880 --> 41:38.240
You are one
weird dude, Magic.

41:45.760 --> 41:48.520
I was the one that led you
back to save your brother.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.960
So if anyone's responsible,
it's me.

41:51.520 --> 41:54.360
48,

41:55.280 --> 41:57.480
49,

41:59.800 --> 42:01.760
50!

42:03.320 --> 42:04.760
51!

42:05.360 --> 42:07.160
That one's for you, Maggie.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.400
Can a soldier get
a drink around here?

42:12.320 --> 42:13.960
Maggie's last photographs.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.400
Preacher, give me a beer.

42:22.360 --> 42:24.080
She was one hell
of a photographer.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.600
She was one hell of a woman.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.920
And I killed her.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.520
No, I did.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.720
Oh, stop it, both of you.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.120
What did she say to you
that time in the bunker?

42:33.200 --> 42:35.640
She said she'd sell
her soul for a Pulitzer.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.840
Not just her soul.

42:39.120 --> 42:41.120
Yeah, well,
I wish she'd got it.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.440
She did.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.440
What?

42:44.480 --> 42:46.080
The Pulitzer.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.840
I wish she'd won
the Pulitzer Prize.

42:47.920 --> 42:51.280
She did,
for her last photograph.

43:12.120 --> 43:16.120
What the hell, I get
repatriated in five years.

43:16.480 --> 43:17.720
You could have been free.

43:17.800 --> 43:18.920
I was free.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.440
Up here, I was always free.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.120
Hey, hey, it's midnight.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.080
It's April 9
and I'm still alive.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.360
