06:27.588 --> 06:28.019
Ah, here we go.

"They bite you and then
make you tell the truth."

06:32.159 --> 06:33.625
Right, I guess
you knew that part.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.828
Well, apparently, "The bugs
feed on these truths,

06:36.830 --> 06:41.433
"and vampires are the only
monsters immune to the bites."

I haven't been spilling
my guts all over.

get rid of them?

squashed or poisoned
or nagged to death,

or even burned with
an enchanted magnifying glass.

06:54.047 --> 06:58.316

we just have to listen
to the truth forever?

06:58.318 --> 06:58.884
Well, that.

06:58.886 --> 07:03.255
And bites from
full-grown bugs
melt monster's brains.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.123

led with that.

07:08.796 --> 07:09.661

suggest the bugs are
vulnerable to overeating.

(WHISPERING) They're asleep.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.535
Who goes there?

20:04.537 --> 20:08.339
Diane needs to rest
for her next performance.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.441
(SNORING)

20:13.245 --> 20:14.545
Medusa?

20:14.547 --> 20:15.713
(HISSING)

20:15.715 --> 20:17.348
They're waking up.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.684
Run! I know a secret shortcut.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.719
Hm.

20:21.721 --> 20:26.657
Your secret shortcut
goes right through
the hotel lobby?

20:26.659 --> 20:28.559
During unhappy hour?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.094
(SOBBING)

20:30.629 --> 20:32.230
I love unhappy hour.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.644
It worked.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.312
LYDIA:
Mavis?

20:48.314 --> 20:49.614
(GASPING)

20:49.616 --> 20:50.982
That's you?

20:50.984 --> 20:52.550
Uh-oh.

20:55.454 --> 20:56.821
Uh.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.592
(SCREAMING)

21:04.096 --> 21:06.297
What is her face doing?

21:07.332 --> 21:08.933
I don't know.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.201
Is that a...

21:10.203 --> 21:12.103
She's kind of sort of...

21:12.105 --> 21:13.271
Oh, no.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.939
She's going to...

21:14.941 --> 21:16.374
ALL: Smile?

21:16.508 --> 21:19.710
MAVIS: It is a smile.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.778
Sort of.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.079
I think she's happy.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.315
Really, really happy.
Kind of?

21:24.317 --> 21:26.384
Why are you in my wrap?

21:26.386 --> 21:28.486
(GASPING, GULPING NERVOUSLY)

21:28.488 --> 21:32.023
Because she wears it
so much better than you.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.991
Oh!

21:34.893 --> 21:37.595
Oh, my glasses are stuck.

21:37.597 --> 21:37.928
(GRUNTING)

21:37.930 --> 21:42.199
Oh, and did anyone
ever tell you, you have
a staring problem?

21:42.201 --> 21:45.903
(LAUGHING) I've wanted to
say that for centuries.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.372
And as for you,
you're grounded.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.175
For having brought Medusa
here in the first place.

21:51.177 --> 21:55.012
Since that was the first
and probably last time

21:55.014 --> 21:56.814
I will almost see you smile,

21:56.816 --> 21:58.649
it was totally worth it.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.919
Is one of my arms
on backwards?

22:01.921 --> 22:03.621
I just got a manicure.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.189
Boo-yeah.
