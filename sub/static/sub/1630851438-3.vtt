A NETFLIX SERIES

00:14.250 --> 00:16.833
Look, if I want my niece back,
I have to steal the coke.

00:16.916 --> 00:19.291
-I have no choice.
-Let me get this straight.

00:19.375 --> 00:22.041
We have to steal 300 keys of coke
from Antwerp Harbor…

00:22.958 --> 00:24.583
without any real strategy

00:25.291 --> 00:27.250
and a bunch of guys that you just met?

00:30.750 --> 00:32.500
I just know one guy.

00:32.583 --> 00:33.416
Well, one girl.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.250
Don't tell me they're kids.

00:36.333 --> 00:39.041
It's just her and three boys,
but she's in total command.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.833
When I was her age, I wasn't.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.208
I can't do this without you.

00:56.166 --> 00:57.583
You're my brother. So yes.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.250
You can count on me.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.958
Fuck it, man, let's do it.

01:09.666 --> 01:11.875
-You got what I asked you to find?
-Yeah.

01:12.833 --> 01:14.416
I did, but I did better.

01:31.125 --> 01:31.958
Good work.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.666
Who are we getting the coke from?

01:35.750 --> 01:37.458
A Flemish guy who runs the harbor.

01:37.541 --> 01:38.958
Does he own it or something?

01:39.583 --> 01:42.041
He takes a cut
whenever coke moves through his port.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.833
It's 300 keys of his personal coke.

01:45.416 --> 01:48.208
-You know what he would do to us?
-What are you talking about?

01:48.791 --> 01:51.875
"What he'd do to us"? Do you hear
the bullshit coming out of your mouth?

01:51.958 --> 01:54.625
Are you serious?
You forget who we're doing this for?

01:55.208 --> 01:56.625
This is for Shaïnez.

01:56.708 --> 01:59.125
If he wants us to rob
his grandma or great aunt,

01:59.208 --> 02:00.708
then you better believe we'll do it.

02:00.791 --> 02:02.708
We'll get the 300 keys
and get Shaïnez back.

02:02.791 --> 02:03.958
You feel me?

02:06.541 --> 02:07.791
For Shaïnez.

02:08.416 --> 02:09.291
For Shaïnez.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.458
Hello, Mr. Djebli.

02:48.541 --> 02:49.458
Yes.

02:50.541 --> 02:52.750
No, I'm not showing any transactions yet.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.833
I know. I know.

02:55.916 --> 02:58.000
How about account 4852.

02:58.666 --> 02:59.500
Thanks.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.125
Um, check that account
against the previous one.

03:05.000 --> 03:05.833
Yes.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.083
Hello.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.041
Hi, Thierry.

03:24.791 --> 03:26.166
I'll leave you to it.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.250
You should've told me you were coming.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.375
I'll only be here for a couple of days.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.500
I didn't want to bother you.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.333
I could've found you something better.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.083
Something safer and more comfortable.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.750
You're not sleeping here, are you?

03:55.833 --> 03:57.166
It would comfort me

03:58.041 --> 04:00.000
if I didn't have to even be here at all.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.916
Well tell me then, why did you come?

04:08.500 --> 04:12.833
Tell me something. That car you came in…
I'm assuming that it's yours?

04:12.916 --> 04:15.166
Yes, it's my car. What's the problem?

04:15.750 --> 04:17.333
And your pack? Where are they?

04:18.375 --> 04:21.416
I hear you've been running around
with four or five guys.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
The same men.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.291
I mean, it's not a pack.
But it's true, I'm protected.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.000
Do you know what animal runs in a pack?

04:34.500 --> 04:35.333
Wolves.

04:35.916 --> 04:36.916
And so do dogs.

04:37.541 --> 04:38.500
Stray dogs.

04:41.791 --> 04:44.875
They aren't stray dogs.
They're men I absolutely trust.

04:44.958 --> 04:45.916
And me?

04:47.333 --> 04:48.625
Can I trust you?

04:49.583 --> 04:50.416
Sure you can.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.333
Okay, tell me then.
Why rob Chris de Wit in Antwerp?

04:54.250 --> 04:55.666
So that's why you came back.

04:56.625 --> 04:58.875
Since you left,
he's been making us pay him.

04:58.958 --> 05:00.166
It's unacceptable.

05:00.708 --> 05:01.541
Saber…

05:03.125 --> 05:06.458
may I remind you
that I've been convicted in this country.

05:06.541 --> 05:10.666
If I get arrested here,
I could be facing ten years in prison.

05:10.750 --> 05:11.916
So what about Chris?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.666
He's now working with a fugitive.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.291
That means more risk.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.291
So it's normal
that he gets a cut of the payment.

05:19.375 --> 05:23.041
He doesn't respect me.
Why should I respect him then?

05:23.125 --> 05:23.958
So…

05:25.250 --> 05:26.583
it's not about the cash.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.333
It's a matter of your pride.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.083
From this moment on,

05:36.541 --> 05:39.916
you are forbidden
from selling any more product on his turf,

05:40.000 --> 05:41.625
you will not steal his coke,

05:41.708 --> 05:44.083
and I forbid you
from sending your dogs after him.

05:44.666 --> 05:45.583
Am I clear?

05:46.333 --> 05:48.208
-Am I clear?
-Yes.

05:48.916 --> 05:49.833
Got it.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.541
See him out, will you?

06:23.208 --> 06:24.291
Morning.

06:25.541 --> 06:26.583
Good morning.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.291
How is it?

06:29.875 --> 06:30.875
Hang on.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.250
Now watch this.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.291
-How much are we thinking?
-Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

06:58.916 --> 07:01.333
We're talking 95%, as expected.

07:01.416 --> 07:02.958
-How much?
-95%.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.041
Wow.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.333
Cut to 70%.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.000
We're going to make 400 kilos
from those 300 kilos.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.541
You're welcome.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.250
-Transportation?
-I got the truck, the driver,

07:15.333 --> 07:16.333
and the escort.

07:16.416 --> 07:19.208
-That just leaves the coke.
-It'll be here tomorrow.

07:27.291 --> 07:30.083
Call the guys at the garage.
Tell them to release the girl.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.375
-Wait, but I thought--
-Just do it. Bring her to her uncle.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.291
Yeah, it's me.

07:58.541 --> 07:59.833
You want to go?

08:24.708 --> 08:27.541
Call them again. She stays where she is.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.333
If her uncle wants her back,

08:30.916 --> 08:32.916
he'll bring us those 300 keys tomorrow.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.458
-What about your father?
-I don't give a fuck.

08:36.541 --> 08:38.875
I'm not gonna let
that son of a bitch do this.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.791
-Do what I said. Beat it.
-Okay. I

09:06.791 --> 09:08.750
-Hey, hey, stand up!
-Let's go.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.041
Stand up!

09:10.125 --> 09:12.458
-There you go.
-Hands out of your pockets.

09:12.541 --> 09:13.416
-Stand up.
-Come on.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.416
Give me your phone.
You too. You got a phone?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.708
Hurry up. Let's go, come on.
Follow them.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.541
-Let's go!
-Back there!

09:22.916 --> 09:23.958
Come on.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.541
In there. Open the door.

09:26.916 --> 09:28.166
Come on, come on.

10:01.958 --> 10:04.708
The guys who took Shaïnez
got back to me.

10:04.791 --> 10:06.333
You'll do exactly as we say.

10:06.416 --> 10:09.208
No improvising, no bright ideas, okay?

10:09.291 --> 10:10.875
If we say you go right, you go right.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.166
If we say go left, you go left.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.333
Look, man, we're not going to listen
to some guys in ski masks.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.333
If you want us to trust you,
you have to trust us. That's the deal.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.833
We'll call you on these.

10:44.541 --> 10:46.125
Keep them on at all times.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.166
You, you'll come with me.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.875
If you're not sure,
you can still change your mind.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.875
I already stole eight kilos.
I can do this.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.083
This'll be worse.

11:11.666 --> 11:12.583
We're doing this.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.125
The guy who took Shaïnez called.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.958
The coke will be in the port
tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

11:21.041 --> 11:23.291
They take it through customs
after they load it on a truck.

11:23.375 --> 11:26.333
But there's always trucks at the docks,
so how do we know which one it is?

11:26.416 --> 11:29.541
-He gave me the dockmaster's name.
-I don't know what that is.

11:30.041 --> 11:33.416
It's the guy in charge of transport.
He takes care of logistics and security.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.083
Every night,
he goes to see the whores by the docks.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.958
-And so?
-We get that guy

11:38.041 --> 11:40.416
and have him tell us
which truck we have to hit.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.333
I got their driver's name too.

11:42.416 --> 11:44.541
Once we've got him,
we need to find his family

11:44.625 --> 11:45.958
so we can pressure him.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.291
And what else do we need?

11:48.916 --> 11:53.166
A warehouse, a 4x4, and a big van.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.291
In 24 hours?

11:54.375 --> 11:55.208
Mm-hmm.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.541
So we're robbing him, right?

11:58.125 --> 11:59.583
-Know how to drive?
-Yeah.

12:01.541 --> 12:04.000
You're going to get us our van. Right now.

12:05.041 --> 12:07.166
-That one?
-Mm. Here.

12:10.041 --> 12:10.958
Okay.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.416
It's nothing compared
to what's coming tomorrow.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.083
You can back out now
if you're still not sure.

12:16.166 --> 12:17.208
No.

12:57.000 --> 12:57.875
Keys.

12:59.875 --> 13:00.875
Beat it.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.666
God bless you.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.833
My daughter,
I'm so happy to see you.

13:22.708 --> 13:25.125
When you were younger, remember…

13:26.625 --> 13:28.250
…that whenever I returned from a trip,

13:28.333 --> 13:30.416
you'd ask me if I'd gotten you a present.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.583
I remember, yeah.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.333
And you always had.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.458
Here.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.666
It's gorgeous,
but I doubt you found it in Switzerland.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.250
I had it at my place.

13:58.125 --> 14:01.916
In an old chest I have not opened
since the time your mother passed away.

14:02.750 --> 14:03.583
It was hers?

14:07.041 --> 14:08.458
Praise the Lord.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.583
God took my baby sister,

14:11.666 --> 14:13.750
but in return, he gave me a daughter.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.291
There.

14:25.541 --> 14:27.166
Does it make you sad?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.458
No, I'm happy.

14:30.916 --> 14:33.291
This is my first time
wearing something of hers.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.250
Listen, my love.

14:38.166 --> 14:42.375
If this necklace is the only thing
your mother left for you…

14:43.375 --> 14:46.625
then let me leave you something else
as an inheritance.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.166
I'm getting old, you know.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.625
And one day, I won't be here.

14:54.666 --> 14:55.875
And once I'm gone…

14:57.583 --> 14:59.666
I want you, Sofia, to take my place.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.833
And Saber?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.166
Saber will accept my decision.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.708
I could never do that to him.

15:20.791 --> 15:24.458
That's exactly why it's so important
that you take my place.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.708
Take some time to think it over.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.458
Okay.

15:40.541 --> 15:42.041
Can I ask you something?

15:43.083 --> 15:44.166
You got any kids?

15:50.041 --> 15:50.916
No.

15:51.833 --> 15:54.625
No I can't ask you something,
or no you don't have kids?

15:55.541 --> 15:56.666
No to both.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.333
You're gonna hijack the truck tomorrow.

16:55.416 --> 16:56.875
And bring it to the warehouse.

16:56.958 --> 16:57.791
Okay.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.250
-Okay?
-Yeah.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.791
Well, now, it's every Wednesday.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.833
-Every Wednesday?
-Without fail, yeah.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.666
He really wants to. He always asks.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.125
Hey, Saber.

17:19.041 --> 17:20.250
You all right?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.125
You remember Gabriel's dad, Pierre?

17:25.208 --> 17:26.875
His son is friends with Milhan.

17:27.458 --> 17:30.166
My son had so much fun
at Milhan's birthday party yesterday.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.375
So I just stopped by to say thanks.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.750
Want to fuck my wife?

17:41.500 --> 17:42.708
Saber, come on.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.416
-Look, I'm sorry, but--
-What are you sorry for?

17:48.041 --> 17:49.833
It's normal.

17:50.916 --> 17:52.333
She is beautiful, isn't she?

17:54.791 --> 17:58.458
Look, I think I should just go. Excuse me.

18:13.583 --> 18:14.833
Are you happy now?

18:17.041 --> 18:18.541
What's your problem, Saber?

18:19.500 --> 18:21.500
You're high. You did too much coke.

18:24.625 --> 18:25.458
See that?

18:26.250 --> 18:29.041
You're dressed like a slut.
You excite all the assholes around here.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.458
Fuck you.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.541
I'll excite who I want.

18:41.458 --> 18:42.500
Mom?

18:43.708 --> 18:44.750
Dad?

18:48.291 --> 18:50.416
It's because your father's back, isn't it?

18:50.500 --> 18:52.500
That's why you're being such an asshole.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.041
There's some nice cars, huh?

19:06.833 --> 19:08.291
Should we take that one?

19:08.875 --> 19:09.916
It's not what we need.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.666
No, it's not what we need…

19:12.541 --> 19:15.375
And that one? That one right there!

19:15.958 --> 19:17.541
-No?
-Not powerful enough.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.875
I've been thinking, by the way.

19:22.958 --> 19:25.041
Just say you're my dad if we get caught.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.333
With that face.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.541
And they'll believe us, for sure.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.583
Hey, Modi. Can you shut up for a while?

19:39.708 --> 19:40.958
What are we doing?

19:41.041 --> 19:42.583
Waiting for the dockmaster.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.541
Why don't I go in with you?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.875
Because you would be in my way.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.166
We should've done this at his house.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.083
Yeah.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.000
Where all the neighbors could see us.

20:14.416 --> 20:17.875
You some sort of Inspector Gadget?
What's with all the weird equipment?

20:18.375 --> 20:19.666
All right. You finished?

20:21.250 --> 20:22.125
You see that?

20:23.125 --> 20:25.125
You'll get the signal off the key.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.125
-Come on!
-No!

20:44.208 --> 20:47.375
Where are you going? Sit down!

20:47.458 --> 20:50.583
Give me your hands!

20:50.666 --> 20:51.666
Give me that.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.291
Shut the fuck up!

20:59.125 --> 21:00.250
That's our guy.

21:05.208 --> 21:06.541
I'll get him to talk.

21:16.625 --> 21:19.041
Did you know your husband
drives for drug dealers?

21:20.375 --> 21:21.791
All we want is his truck.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.416
Big guy here's
gonna stay with you until we get it.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.333
Hey, hey, hey, it's happening.

21:27.416 --> 21:28.500
Hear what I'm saying?

21:36.375 --> 21:39.208
Psst.
Take the other car. Hurry up!

21:43.583 --> 21:44.666
I'll be right back.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.958
Just stick to the plan.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.500
Any problems, you call me.

22:27.916 --> 22:29.125
Fuck! Shit!

22:44.500 --> 22:45.833
Don't move! Don't move!

22:53.375 --> 22:54.833
Come here.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.958
Stay right there, we need to talk!

23:08.291 --> 23:11.375
Don't move, you're coming with me.
We've got a container to find.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.583
Hello.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.916
It's Saber,
he's completely lost it!

23:33.000 --> 23:33.875
What happened?

23:33.958 --> 23:36.791
I don't know what to do anymore.
I have to get out of here.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.625
Listen to me, okay? I'm on my way.
Hang tight.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.583
Please hurry.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.458
I know, I'll hurry. See you soon.

24:01.416 --> 24:03.208
I swear, I can't take this anymore.

24:04.916 --> 24:06.625
I'll disappear with Milhan.

24:07.375 --> 24:08.583
I'll speak to him.

24:08.666 --> 24:10.458
Give him one last chance,

24:10.541 --> 24:13.458
and if it doesn't work out,
then I'll let you go, I promise.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.791
You know what I found in the bathroom
three weeks ago?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.500
I found coke, Sofia. He'll use it
and just leave it lying around.

24:22.583 --> 24:24.833
Can you imagine if Milhan
had gotten into it?

24:25.708 --> 24:27.166
He can't keep doing this anymore.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.166
You're right. Help me change him.

24:29.625 --> 24:32.041
Doesn't matter what I say.
You're not listening.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.458
I hear you, I do, but I can't let you go.

24:36.541 --> 24:37.583
What are you saying?

24:39.125 --> 24:41.166
If you disappear, nothing goes with you.

24:43.666 --> 24:45.291
You think I'm here for the money?

24:45.375 --> 24:46.916
I don't give a fuck about the money.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.833
I don't give a fuck about the house.

24:50.666 --> 24:52.166
All that matters is my son.

24:53.291 --> 24:54.625
I just told you, Coralie…

24:55.875 --> 24:57.416
if you disappear, nothing goes with you.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.916
You've been trained well.
Your uncle was thorough.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.208
You've become just like him.

25:06.291 --> 25:07.791
But remember this, Sofia…

25:09.041 --> 25:10.666
Saber is not your brother, okay?

25:11.750 --> 25:16.166
And Hassan is not your father.
You're just like me. We're on the outside.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.750
Don't worry, I'll remember.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.583
And I'll remember
everything he's done for me.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.375
Your uncle was arrested once.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.625
Thirty years ago, for drug trafficking.

25:30.708 --> 25:31.958
You know how much time he did?

25:32.500 --> 25:33.750
Six months.

25:36.708 --> 25:38.125
Know why he got out so fast?

25:38.208 --> 25:40.541
They had no evidence.
Just some witnesses who recanted.

25:40.625 --> 25:42.083
The witnesses were anonymous.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.708
They never recanted, Sofia.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.666
Hassan tracked them down.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.416
He killed them both.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.875
It was your parents, Sofia.

26:05.458 --> 26:06.750
Ask Saber about it.

26:11.458 --> 26:12.291
No!

27:53.916 --> 27:56.416
What is the number
of that fucking container?

27:56.500 --> 27:58.291
I'm not saying anything.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.916
What container is the coke in? Tell me!

28:01.000 --> 28:02.958
Go fuck yourself.
I'm not saying.

28:24.958 --> 28:26.458
My first day,

28:26.541 --> 28:29.291
they make me believe it,
and I wind up like a grunt

28:29.375 --> 28:31.958
counting every container
that gets off-loaded.

28:32.041 --> 28:32.875
No kidding!

28:32.958 --> 28:35.541
I still haven't lived it down.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.666
But after working for five years,

28:42.750 --> 28:44.833
I've never lost a single container.

28:45.375 --> 28:48.041
Chris, you've entrusted me
with 127 containers.

28:48.541 --> 28:50.541
-That's how many will be delivered.
-Ah.

28:50.625 --> 28:51.708
Very good, mate.

28:52.833 --> 28:53.916
Still no answer.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.208
Keep trying.

28:57.583 --> 28:59.125
Keep going.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.500
You really want me to?
He's not telling me anything,

29:01.583 --> 29:03.666
and his phone won't stop ringing.

29:03.750 --> 29:04.791
Hit him harder.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.166
What's wrong?
All the trucks are leaving!

29:14.458 --> 29:16.250
The boat docked 30 minutes ago.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.958
They probably have it on the truck,
but they haven't left.

30:00.541 --> 30:02.833
I don't know what the fuck to do.
He's foaming at the mouth.

30:04.125 --> 30:06.333
It's an epileptic fit.
I hit him once more, he'll die.

30:07.416 --> 30:10.125
-We need a plan B.
-Just get him to speak.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.250
Dammit.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.000
-What's happening?
-He fainted.

30:16.083 --> 30:17.833
But we're running out of time.

30:21.041 --> 30:22.208
Look, I've got an idea.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.708
-Hello?
-I need his picture.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.375
Can you please just send me
a fucking photo?

30:39.458 --> 30:40.375
Hurry up.

31:00.708 --> 31:03.458
It's all good. I got his picture.
I'm going in.

31:20.458 --> 31:23.041
Something's wrong.
Still no answer.

31:23.875 --> 31:25.916
Call the escort.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Tell them to keep their eyes open.

31:28.083 --> 31:31.750
…so I hereby toast to you.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.000
Any news?

31:39.083 --> 31:40.416
No, still no news.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.708
Are you in position?

31:41.791 --> 31:43.875
Yes, we're in position as planned.

31:45.541 --> 31:47.500
In any case, we're watching the truck.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.250
It's still on the docks.

31:51.666 --> 31:52.500
Keep an eye open.

31:52.583 --> 31:53.666
Our eyes are open.

31:53.750 --> 31:55.041
Stay in position.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.708
Ice-cold drinks!

32:20.791 --> 32:22.083
Ice-cold drinks!

32:24.416 --> 32:25.333
Get lost.

32:25.416 --> 32:27.000
It's only two euros!

32:27.083 --> 32:28.208
Look, piss off!

32:28.291 --> 32:30.083
Open up.
I'll show you all the flavors.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.083
-Beat it.
-It'll take 30 seconds.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.583
Get the hell out of here!

32:50.583 --> 32:54.416
Don't fuck around
or your wife will pay.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.750
Okay?

33:02.458 --> 33:04.208
You're gonna follow
your itinerary.

33:04.833 --> 33:06.875
Start the truck. Let's go.

33:11.958 --> 33:13.458
We're good. I'm in the truck.

33:15.750 --> 33:18.666
Tony, we got it. We're good.
I'll see you at the warehouse.

33:27.333 --> 33:28.333
Shit.

33:38.041 --> 33:40.666
I'm driving the guy.
I'll meet you at the warehouse.

33:42.333 --> 33:43.583
We're in position.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.500
Don't try anything stupid, okay?

33:59.708 --> 34:01.875
All good.
The truck's moving.

34:04.916 --> 34:06.000
Do you see the truck?

34:06.083 --> 34:07.750
No, not yet.

34:08.583 --> 34:10.541
But it won't be long now.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.083
It's moving on schedule.

34:28.416 --> 34:29.833
Close the door.

34:29.916 --> 34:31.041
What should I do?

34:31.791 --> 34:32.666
Nothing.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.625
Okay, I get it.
I'm always the chump.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.500
Keep your eyes on the road!

34:59.666 --> 35:00.750
Turn left! Turn left!

35:08.916 --> 35:10.083
Okay, we're almost there.

35:10.666 --> 35:11.750
Okay, we're good.

35:22.583 --> 35:24.833
Don't move. Don't fucking move.

35:33.875 --> 35:37.541
Three, two, one.

35:38.958 --> 35:41.000
We're good. I see it.

35:41.083 --> 35:44.958
Keep your eyes open.
Call when you're at the meeting point.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.083
Let the car pass.

36:21.625 --> 36:23.208
Fuck! Turn, turn, turn!

36:27.416 --> 36:29.041
Keep driving, don't stop!

36:45.000 --> 36:46.875
Give me your hands, asshole.

36:51.625 --> 36:52.458
Don't move.

37:26.291 --> 37:28.166
Fuck! It stopped.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.208
Behind the docks.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.250
-At the warehouse.
-Fuck!

37:32.083 --> 37:33.458
Send the guys over there.

38:16.750 --> 38:19.000
We've got the coke.
Let's load it up.

38:20.333 --> 38:21.500
Let's go. Come on, move.

38:32.083 --> 38:34.583
Modi, hurry, hurry!
We're good. We're good.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.875
Come on, come on!

38:56.958 --> 38:58.333
Modi, toss it!

39:10.583 --> 39:12.666
Nahel, can you grab
the ones on the ground?

39:13.916 --> 39:15.250
There's more down here.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.500
Let's go, let's go!

40:09.000 --> 40:10.333
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

40:15.541 --> 40:17.458
We've got company!
They're here!

40:18.916 --> 40:20.958
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

40:47.333 --> 40:48.500
Get in the front! Go!

41:04.166 --> 41:06.541
Modi! Modi!

41:10.958 --> 41:12.958
Fuck!

41:13.041 --> 41:15.375
-Stop the car! We have to stop!
-Too late!

41:15.458 --> 41:17.625
-It's too late. Go! Hurry!
-Modi!
