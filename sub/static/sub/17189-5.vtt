WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:02.281
- Come back to me.
- I will.

00:02.324 --> 00:05.503
- Why can't you just be my mate!
- Because I love you!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.147
How did you propose to your wife?

00:08.202 --> 00:10.089
You're married and you didn't think to say?

00:10.116 --> 00:11.222
We've split up.

00:11.609 --> 00:13.427
Molls, I'm going to give you something now

00:13.547 --> 00:14.968
and no strings attached.

00:15.002 --> 00:16.400
You've ruined everything.

00:16.412 --> 00:17.899
You do not bring personal
into the battlefield.

00:17.899 --> 00:19.592
- Is that understood?
- You did.

00:19.648 --> 00:21.229
Am I going to die?

00:21.252 --> 00:22.560
Move!

00:25.891 --> 00:26.858
Bashira.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.268
She's safe.

00:28.689 --> 00:29.849
Not any more.

00:32.302 --> 00:35.197
Two Cat A urgent medivac required.

00:56.386 --> 00:57.326
Where are they?

00:57.359 --> 00:58.863
Get to the hospital.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.411
Molly?

01:26.842 --> 01:29.590
- Jackie, what's happening? Where are they?
- Calm down...

01:30.933 --> 01:32.100
Boss man?

01:38.978 --> 01:40.388
Is he going to be all right?

01:41.870 --> 01:43.026
I've got to go.

01:46.670 --> 01:47.848
Smurf!

01:48.633 --> 01:50.568
- He died in the MERT!
- What?

01:50.590 --> 01:52.420
They had to resuscitate him twice.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.655
- We're going to lose him.
- No. He's going to be all right.

01:55.693 --> 01:58.820
- What have I done, what have I done?
- It weren't your fault.

01:59.899 --> 02:01.032
No.

02:01.536 --> 02:03.288
It was you and the Boss's.

02:55.787 --> 02:59.403
- ... down!
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

03:07.703 --> 03:09.865
How come I wasn't hit, sir?

03:10.877 --> 03:14.067
When Badrai got out of that
truck firing, why wasn't I hit?

03:14.089 --> 03:15.897
I should have been hit, not them.

03:16.516 --> 03:18.783
I'd do anything to make
sure they were all right.

03:19.110 --> 03:21.144
I'd swap places in a flash.

03:22.012 --> 03:23.958
I'd like you to have
a chat with the doctor.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.826
- Can you sort that, Corporal?
- Sir.

03:26.552 --> 03:28.266
I'm not mad, sir.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.475
I'm just saying that if it
was me and not them, then

03:32.496 --> 03:34.306
everything would be all right.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.256
- I shouldn't have got involved.
- Involved?

03:46.277 --> 03:47.964
If I hadn't got involved with Bashira,

03:47.978 --> 03:49.430
then the Boss and Smurf would be fine

03:49.445 --> 03:51.469
- and I wouldn't have had to kill anyone.
- They're going to be fine.

03:51.508 --> 03:52.619
How do you know that?

03:53.710 --> 03:54.950
Exactly!

03:56.269 --> 03:57.695
The others are about to get some scoff.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.778
I think you should join them.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.487
I'll go and find someone to

04:00.531 --> 04:03.190
- square Smurf and the Boss's kit away.
- I'll do it.

04:07.870 --> 04:08.632
OK,

04:09.704 --> 04:11.910
get it itemised, get it over
to the QM's department ASAP

04:11.932 --> 04:13.785
so they can get it on
the freight to the UK.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.548
And make sure you sanitise it.

04:21.668 --> 04:24.975
We don't want Mrs James finding
an unexpected stash of porn, do we?

06:26.833 --> 06:28.769
Wow, nearly didn't recognise you.

06:28.835 --> 06:29.919
It's me.

06:30.230 --> 06:31.876
You look like a teacher!

06:32.190 --> 06:34.750
- I am a teacher.
- I should be a detective.

06:38.190 --> 06:42.276
So, you're off to Cyprus now.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.721
Yeah, that's it.

06:43.997 --> 06:46.264
Decompression then normalisation.

06:47.310 --> 06:50.180
Doesn't feel very normal
at the moment, though.

06:50.230 --> 06:51.262
It will do.

06:51.614 --> 06:54.019
Takes a long time. But one day...

06:54.470 --> 06:56.555
... everything feels normal again.

07:00.564 --> 07:03.032
Do you think Bashira's found "normal" yet?

07:03.870 --> 07:05.651
She will do. One day.

07:05.921 --> 07:07.984
Please, Qaseem. Will
you find out where she is

07:07.997 --> 07:10.364
and go and see her? Just let
me know that she's all right.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.076
Will you do that for me?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.553
Please, Qaseem. Just this one thing.

07:16.712 --> 07:18.861
I know that if you promise
me you'll do it, you will.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.812
Cos you're a decent bloke.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.044
Goodbye,

07:37.433 --> 07:39.221
Molly Dawes.

08:13.086 --> 08:16.180
'Man down! Man down!'

08:19.653 --> 08:21.355
'Hold your fire... '

08:21.475 --> 08:23.110
There you go.

08:27.150 --> 08:28.740
You're a gent.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.380
There ain't many of us
left, as me grandad says.

08:31.430 --> 08:33.140
Don't fancy a dip in the sea, no?

08:33.190 --> 08:34.740
I can't really swim.

08:34.940 --> 08:37.152
But don't tell that lot
of piss-taking tossers.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.904
How'd you get in the
Army if you can't swim?

08:38.909 --> 08:40.950
Pulled a sickie that day.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.875
There's people here you
can talk to, you know.

08:46.069 --> 08:47.340
I'm talking to you.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.060
You know what I'm talking about.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.515
I just want to go home. This is pointless.

08:51.570 --> 08:52.820
It's decompression.

08:52.870 --> 08:56.110
If we were complete I'd understand.
But we ain't, we're two down.

08:58.901 --> 09:01.174
Look, I know you're pretty
loved up by him, but...

09:02.219 --> 09:04.154
he's in the best possible hands.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.437
Oh, come on, it was a bit obvious.

09:06.636 --> 09:07.847
What?

09:08.599 --> 09:09.865
You and Smurf.

09:15.620 --> 09:17.340
Thank God HE's going to be all right.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.020
What do you mean by that?

09:19.070 --> 09:21.945
You said thank God he's going to
be all right, like the Boss ain't.

09:23.023 --> 09:25.110
The Boss is going to
have to have an operation.

09:26.562 --> 09:27.660
Why?

09:27.710 --> 09:29.692
There's been complications.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.380
Is that bad?

09:31.430 --> 09:32.670
It's not good, Dawes.

09:34.390 --> 09:36.110
But at least you've got Smurf.

10:52.750 --> 10:56.067
There's only one thing worse than
not having your parents turn up,

10:56.187 --> 10:58.284
and that's your parents turning up.

10:59.423 --> 11:00.108
Molls

11:00.153 --> 11:01.620
- Molly!
- Right on cue!

11:01.670 --> 11:03.614
I been worried sick about you.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.380
I'm back now.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.069
Aw... you've come back to me.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.288
- Nan!
- Nan hired a Corsa for us to get here.

11:11.299 --> 11:12.411
Nice of her, isn't it, eh?

11:12.455 --> 11:14.620
She hasn't driven for 20
years and she was shit then.

11:14.670 --> 11:17.420
It's confidence shattering
having him sitting next to me.

11:17.470 --> 11:20.057
Seriously, Molls, he's in
the back on the way home.

11:20.074 --> 11:23.171
Can you come home before
barracks so I can look after you?

11:23.204 --> 11:24.376
I'm not coming straight back, Mum.

11:24.387 --> 11:26.540
I've got to go to the hospital
and see Smurf and that.

11:26.731 --> 11:27.620
Oh...

11:27.670 --> 11:28.660
Birmingham.

11:28.982 --> 11:30.624
Well, we'll drop you off, then.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.310
Well, come here!

11:39.747 --> 11:41.964
You can't even drive,
mate, so wind your neck in!

11:41.998 --> 11:43.242
I also can't fly a plane

11:43.253 --> 11:45.133
but if I'm being rocked
about like I'm on a waltzer...

11:45.177 --> 11:47.388
I asked you to marry me on
a waltzer, didn't I, Belinda?

11:47.399 --> 11:49.113
Yeah, just before I spewed my guts up.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.485
Was that cos of the
waltzer or the question?

11:53.188 --> 11:54.841
I'll pay for the petrol, Nan.

11:54.902 --> 11:57.257
Don't be so daft. Your dad can.

11:57.473 --> 11:59.065
You tight old mare.

12:03.351 --> 12:04.843
Right, come on, fellas, double it up.

12:04.865 --> 12:05.675
Where's Dawesy gone?

12:05.689 --> 12:07.508
Probably gone to make herself
beautiful for the journey!

12:07.524 --> 12:09.736
For you we'd be waiting a week, Fingers.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.706
- You saying I'm a minger, boss?
- I'm saying, have a look in the mirror. Now on!

12:12.739 --> 12:14.912
I happen to know I'm beautiful, me.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.260
Birmingham ain't far, is it?

12:21.310 --> 12:24.041
You can just drop me off at a
station if you want, I don't mind.

12:24.096 --> 12:25.329
It's fine.

12:25.449 --> 12:26.822
Yeah, we'll take you.

12:27.004 --> 12:29.896
You must be tired. And you've
got your uniform on and all that.

12:29.934 --> 12:33.020
Most people don't hate us, Mum.
Some people actually appreciate us.

12:33.070 --> 12:35.004
And they don't mind you
going straight to Birmingham?

12:35.470 --> 12:38.604
No, I asked. It's because
I'm the medic. I'm allowed.

12:38.869 --> 12:41.307
You were never one for
rules and regulations, eh?

13:09.402 --> 13:10.845
He's in theatre.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.542
The Boss.

13:13.206 --> 13:14.262
What's happening?

13:14.306 --> 13:16.872
The first operation last week
doesn't seem to have done the trick.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.360
He got rushed in to
theatre about an hour ago.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.522
You've come just in time.

13:24.590 --> 13:25.780
Is it that bad?

13:25.830 --> 13:27.913
The next 12 hours are apparently...

13:29.710 --> 13:30.750
You know.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.200
So the nurses have said.

13:33.870 --> 13:35.260
He's a fighter.

13:35.793 --> 13:37.795
Some things you just can't fight.

13:39.030 --> 13:41.151
Smurf, I'm sorry.

13:43.070 --> 13:44.883
I understand if you hate me.

13:44.905 --> 13:46.230
Shut up.

13:50.270 --> 13:51.550
How are you doing?

13:54.155 --> 13:55.542
I got a lucky escape.

13:55.564 --> 13:57.270
Hmm... not that lucky.

13:57.390 --> 13:58.630
The scars will heal.

14:00.390 --> 14:02.542
Smurf, I know it's all my fault.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.820
I guess you can't help your feelings
any more than I can help mine.

14:08.177 --> 14:10.228
Nothing happened between me and the Boss.

14:10.239 --> 14:11.860
I mean nothing actually happened.

14:11.910 --> 14:13.987
It didn't need to, did it?

14:14.469 --> 14:17.332
- If I could have my time again...
- What?

14:18.350 --> 14:20.943
- Seriously, what would you do different?
- All of it.

14:20.971 --> 14:22.915
I'd do everything differently.

14:23.485 --> 14:25.826
But you'd still love the Boss.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.284
What would you do different?

14:36.342 --> 14:37.724
You know.

14:37.945 --> 14:38.940
What?

14:39.970 --> 14:41.905
I'd call you after that night.

14:42.430 --> 14:44.980
Who knows how things
could have panned out then.

14:45.181 --> 14:47.340
He's going to be in theatre a long time.

14:47.390 --> 14:48.860
Why don't you go and rest?

14:48.910 --> 14:51.100
I promised myself I'd
wait here. I'll wait here.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.390
OK.

15:12.910 --> 15:13.940
How is he?

15:13.990 --> 15:16.123
It was an emergency operation.

15:16.158 --> 15:18.314
No-one expected this latest bleed.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.590
We'll be monitoring
him throughout the night

15:20.616 --> 15:23.201
- and let's see where we are in the morning.
- Thank you.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.599
Now go and get some sleep.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.630
I'm not going anywhere.

15:32.414 --> 15:33.910
Nor me.

15:40.470 --> 15:41.780
He looks bad.

15:41.830 --> 15:43.030
You can't tell.

15:56.870 --> 15:58.462
Do you want your ring back?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.830
- You might need it when...
- Shut your cake hole.

16:24.003 --> 16:26.184
Sorry.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.230
How did you know we were here?

17:00.350 --> 17:02.550
I'm not sure you are. Morphine.

17:02.580 --> 17:05.343
Well, I'm drug free,
and I can see you, so...

17:05.510 --> 17:06.869
I guess I must be here.

17:08.950 --> 17:09.876
Smurf?

17:09.915 --> 17:11.895
- I'm drug free too, Boss.
- Are you?

17:12.015 --> 17:13.945
Are you talking about
hospital drugs? Oh, yeah,

17:14.449 --> 17:15.953
I'm full to bursting with them.

17:16.390 --> 17:18.347
Can't give me enough.

17:20.253 --> 17:22.145
I dunno what I was thinking, Boss,

17:22.566 --> 17:23.787
I lost control.

17:23.964 --> 17:25.220
We all did.

17:25.473 --> 17:27.121
Taught me I'm no soldier.

17:27.330 --> 17:29.190
I'm proud to have served
alongside you, Smurf.

17:37.279 --> 17:38.534
Anyway,

17:39.960 --> 17:41.923
I'm not missing the hospital breakfast.

17:41.939 --> 17:42.852
You going?

17:43.023 --> 17:44.289
I've seen the Boss.

17:44.798 --> 17:45.932
I'm outta here.

17:59.390 --> 18:00.630
How are you feeling?

18:04.470 --> 18:05.870
You're going to be all right.

18:12.848 --> 18:13.816
Hello, scamp.

18:13.882 --> 18:16.304
Mum! Mum! They didn't rub it off!

18:16.326 --> 18:17.791
They didn't rub it off!

18:19.230 --> 18:21.470
This is someone who helped
Daddy in Afghanistan.

18:22.910 --> 18:25.526
- I wouldn't be here if it weren't for her.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

18:26.261 --> 18:27.843
You're funny!

18:30.350 --> 18:32.025
What I mean is she saved my life.

18:32.301 --> 18:34.413
I would have bled out if it
weren't for her prompt actions.

18:34.452 --> 18:36.740
- I better go.
- Oh, don't go on my account.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.638
I... I better go.

18:41.710 --> 18:43.350
It's good to see you, Dawes.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.190
Ditto.

19:00.286 --> 19:01.674
I thought it was you.

19:02.227 --> 19:05.113
I saw you from the car park.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.070
Have you seen him?

19:12.550 --> 19:14.590
He's going to be all right. I promise.

19:21.673 --> 19:23.885
She's saved me twice
now, haven't you, Dawesy?

19:25.110 --> 19:26.893
Put that bloody phone down,

19:26.899 --> 19:28.806
you'll affect the hospital
machines and what not.

19:28.822 --> 19:30.105
That's bollocks, Mum.

19:30.171 --> 19:32.692
Like having phones in planes.
Doesn't do anything, they just

19:32.753 --> 19:35.053
don't want people talking
away and annoying each other.

19:38.675 --> 19:39.903
Guess what?

19:40.390 --> 19:41.430
They're on their way.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.430
Smurfy!

19:48.270 --> 19:51.267
Where is he? Where's old "sick note"?

19:59.815 --> 20:00.634
Dawesy.

20:00.683 --> 20:02.724
Oh, no, you're only allowed
two visitors at a time.

20:02.751 --> 20:04.390
We're war heroes. No rules!

20:08.358 --> 20:11.233
I know what you're going
to say. And fair enough,

20:12.383 --> 20:13.740
I'll take the bollocking.

20:14.523 --> 20:16.540
Well, you wanted to get
up here and see Smurf.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.060
And we do have a modicum of
compassion in the British Army.

20:19.110 --> 20:21.197
- So I ain't in trouble?
- No.

20:21.379 --> 20:23.342
But you are coming back to
the barracks with us, though.

20:23.558 --> 20:24.647
Understood?

20:25.430 --> 20:26.411
How is he?

20:26.698 --> 20:27.870
Take a look!

20:28.888 --> 20:31.122
Well, you know he's been
through a lot on tour.

20:31.288 --> 20:33.798
- Understandable he...
- We all know what he did.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.220
We all respond to
contact in different ways.

20:36.988 --> 20:39.030
I just want to make sure there
are no repercussions for him.

20:41.412 --> 20:43.558
Look, while you're all here
I might go and get a drink.

20:43.569 --> 20:44.510
OK.

20:51.110 --> 20:52.233
Smurfoid,

20:52.410 --> 20:54.162
good to see you, pal.

21:22.910 --> 21:24.100
Has Rebecca gone?

21:24.150 --> 21:26.294
She went whilst I was on my second tour.

21:26.414 --> 21:27.510
You know what I mean.

21:30.510 --> 21:32.371
I wasn't very good at the life she wanted.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.900
What life was that?

21:33.950 --> 21:35.594
Settled, I guess.

21:36.445 --> 21:37.670
Not so good at that.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.421
Always preferred being on tour,

21:40.620 --> 21:41.950
living out of a bergen.

21:43.295 --> 21:45.158
The Army is all I've ever known, it's...

21:45.866 --> 21:47.154
all I've ever wanted.

21:48.830 --> 21:49.990
I'm sorry.

21:51.350 --> 21:52.470
Until I met you.

21:56.390 --> 21:59.087
I've still got Afghan grime in my hair.

22:00.768 --> 22:02.825
I don't think I could have
actually lived with myself

22:02.830 --> 22:04.368
if I'd managed to get you killed.

22:04.777 --> 22:06.081
It wasn't your fault.

22:06.303 --> 22:07.718
I was the officer.

22:08.138 --> 22:09.145
I failed you.

22:10.910 --> 22:12.470
And the rest of the platoon.

22:14.110 --> 22:15.812
You didn't fail anybody.

22:20.030 --> 22:21.679
I'm resigning my commission.

22:22.856 --> 22:24.288
It happened on my watch.

22:25.593 --> 22:27.100
What are you going to do?

22:27.150 --> 22:28.190
I'm not sure.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.008
What I do know is

22:33.627 --> 22:35.474
there's nothing in our way any more.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.668
We don't have to wait out.

22:48.510 --> 22:50.160
Parade!

22:51.227 --> 22:54.225
By the left... quick march!

23:09.676 --> 23:12.977
Parade... halt!

23:14.353 --> 23:16.842
By the right... turn!

23:18.390 --> 23:19.617
Step!

23:20.391 --> 23:21.630
Front!

23:22.830 --> 23:24.942
Stand at... ease.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.390
Stand easy!

23:29.637 --> 23:30.775
Parade formed up.

23:30.803 --> 23:33.203
Ready for inspection and
presentation of medals, sir.

23:40.821 --> 23:42.180
Proud day for my section.

23:42.695 --> 23:43.845
Our CO,

23:44.039 --> 23:46.007
Captain James, injured on tour,

23:46.328 --> 23:47.909
wrote up a member of our section

23:47.959 --> 23:49.518
for an honour six months ago

23:49.638 --> 23:51.906
after an extraordinary act of courage.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.643
Private Dawes has been recognised

23:54.763 --> 23:57.082
on the operational honours and awards list

23:57.148 --> 24:00.790
for her bravery and valour on Op Herrick.

24:01.118 --> 24:02.766
Private Dylan Smith was injured

24:02.804 --> 24:04.960
and with no regard to her personal safety,

24:04.999 --> 24:07.598
she put his life ahead of her own.

24:08.273 --> 24:11.540
To save a life whilst being
willing to sacrifice your own,

24:11.767 --> 24:14.117
is above and beyond the call of duty.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.218
Her Majesty The Queen

24:16.338 --> 24:17.777
has found it fitting

24:17.816 --> 24:19.552
to award Private Dawes

24:19.624 --> 24:20.973
the Military Cross.

24:38.070 --> 24:40.886
Here you are, Molls. We have so
got to come to the Palace with you.

24:40.919 --> 24:43.054
Oh, mate, put me down for a bit of that.

24:43.054 --> 24:46.018
We'll have to grab ourselves one of
them swanky stretch limos, eh, Molls?

24:46.030 --> 24:48.821
Mansfield, we might even
get to see your doppelganger.

24:48.843 --> 24:50.209
Doppel-ginga!

24:51.668 --> 24:53.580
This muppet reckons he
looks like Prince Harry.

24:53.630 --> 24:56.141
About as much as I look like Duchess Kate!

24:57.153 --> 25:00.460
I am the proudest dad in the
whole world right now, fellas.

25:00.510 --> 25:03.003
- My little girl...
- Just drop the bullshit now, yeah?

25:03.318 --> 25:05.110
That's it, all right. I
don't want to hear any more!

25:05.331 --> 25:07.100
How was what I even did heroic?

25:07.150 --> 25:09.367
- You deserve it, Molls.
- Course she did.

25:09.599 --> 25:10.982
You heard what that captain had to say.

25:11.015 --> 25:12.460
Yeah, from his hospital bed!

25:12.779 --> 25:13.979
Valour and all that.

25:14.099 --> 25:15.759
Bravery on the battlefield.

25:15.798 --> 25:17.257
Oh, here she is!

25:17.270 --> 25:19.641
You're a chip off of the
old block, ain't ya, Molls?

25:19.663 --> 25:20.962
- You all right?
- Yeah.

25:20.968 --> 25:22.670
Isn't she brilliant?

25:36.217 --> 25:37.300
What was that?

25:37.815 --> 25:39.300
It's just an e-mail, Nan, relax.

25:39.579 --> 25:40.550
Smurf?

25:43.110 --> 25:44.180
What?

25:44.230 --> 25:45.260
Nothing.

25:46.025 --> 25:47.911
Come on, it's bloody something.

25:47.966 --> 25:49.940
It's just a friend of mine from Afghan.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.060
Soldier?

25:51.110 --> 25:53.140
No, he's a teacher at a university.

25:53.190 --> 25:56.293
They got a university
in Af-bleeding-ganistan?

25:56.774 --> 25:58.908
Bet they don't have to
pay nine grand to go there!

25:58.941 --> 26:00.766
He's looking after a little friend of mine.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.955
Well, he's trying to...

26:03.895 --> 26:06.550
Oh, why is nothing ever simple, Nan?

26:07.670 --> 26:08.750
What is it?

26:10.350 --> 26:11.277
Come on,

26:11.518 --> 26:12.701
tell your nan.

26:12.731 --> 26:14.910
- I'm going for a run.
- Tell me first.

26:16.590 --> 26:19.597
We got this little girl
into a safe house in Kabul.

26:19.804 --> 26:21.332
My friend was trying to see her

26:21.352 --> 26:24.020
and when he finally got permission
he found out she'd been moved.

26:24.070 --> 26:26.227
Now he's got to start the process over.

26:26.950 --> 26:28.580
I'm sure she'll be all right.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.275
Are you? Cos I sure as hell
haven't got a bloody clue!

26:31.866 --> 26:33.574
It's tearing me apart, Nan.

26:33.597 --> 26:34.540
Why?

26:34.590 --> 26:37.699
Because I might've ruined her
life. I might have even killed her.

26:37.819 --> 26:39.988
Kabul is so dangerous...

26:56.710 --> 26:58.140
I'm going for a run, Mum.

26:58.190 --> 27:00.510
What, round here? You're brave.

27:02.230 --> 27:05.158
Course you are, you're in
the Army! Got medals for it.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.829
I might run up to Stratford
and run round that park there.

27:07.851 --> 27:09.399
She's going stir crazy.

27:09.438 --> 27:11.140
Just crazy, Nan.

27:11.190 --> 27:13.081
Maybe they can sort us out a double room.

27:13.087 --> 27:14.150
What, you cracking up an' all?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.940
You'd have to be insane not to
crack up with the life I've had.

27:20.286 --> 27:22.768
Oh, fuck me, the coven
taking the piss again.

27:22.785 --> 27:25.838
- Oh, yeah.
- Actually, I'm thinking of doing an Iron Man next year.

27:25.870 --> 27:29.719
- What's one of them?
- Running, cycling, swimming, endurance thing.

27:30.206 --> 27:33.291
Once I've pumped up the tyres on me
bike I'm going to be full-time on it.

27:34.363 --> 27:36.491
I'd do anything to get into
shape for the woman I love.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.561
Put her down, it's quite vomit inducing.

27:41.673 --> 27:43.000
Did you say you're going out, Molly?

27:43.022 --> 27:44.172
I'm going for a run.

27:44.292 --> 27:45.593
Why, are you coming?

27:45.713 --> 27:46.875
Starting tomorrow.

27:46.903 --> 27:48.490
Can you get us some rolling papers?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
I've got some change upstairs.

27:49.550 --> 27:51.740
Nah, it's all right. I've
got 14 grand in the bank.

27:51.790 --> 27:54.460
- Deployment money.
- Get us some baccy an' all, then!

27:54.510 --> 27:57.236
Here, I might get you to buy
me a new Beemer, eh, Molls, eh?!

27:57.356 --> 27:59.774
You'll remember your old man
when you're flashing the cash, eh?

28:02.750 --> 28:05.209
Not long now and that'll
all be luxury houses.

28:05.264 --> 28:06.420
What, round here?!

28:06.708 --> 28:08.472
They might have marble worktops

28:08.510 --> 28:11.380
but they've still got to look out
the window and see you in your pants.

28:11.430 --> 28:13.460
I've been over there. West Ham.

28:13.510 --> 28:15.289
Told them you've come home a hero.

28:15.409 --> 28:17.882
They said they want you as
a guest of honour... plus one.

28:18.002 --> 28:18.938
Me.

28:18.976 --> 28:19.980
Football?

28:20.030 --> 28:21.337
Do it for Daddy, Molls.

28:21.763 --> 28:23.306
I can't afford to go else.

28:23.426 --> 28:25.350
All you got to do is walk around the pitch.

28:26.458 --> 28:27.624
No!

28:28.030 --> 28:30.594
Nip over there. Bloke called Ben.
He'll show you what you got to do.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.300
- No, Dad!
- There's a free meal and everything!

28:33.350 --> 28:35.277
And I'll get to meet my heroes.

28:35.537 --> 28:39.181
âª Paolo Di Canio, Paolo Di Canio âª

28:39.209 --> 28:41.305
âª Paolo Di Canio! âª

29:10.270 --> 29:11.681
Excuse me...

29:13.150 --> 29:14.578
You dropped this.

29:17.550 --> 29:18.923
You want to buy...

29:29.053 --> 29:31.361
- Two, one, go!
- Come on.

29:31.481 --> 29:35.031
Quick. Move. Mum said upstairs.

29:35.036 --> 29:38.697
Give me that back! It's
not fair. Give it back.

29:42.175 --> 29:43.894
What's the matter with them
bits of cheese you've cut off?

29:44.014 --> 29:46.740
- Don't like the end bits.
- It's Cheddar, it ain't got any end bits!

29:47.013 --> 29:49.850
There's people in the world that
would be grateful for that cheese!

29:49.883 --> 29:53.070
Some people that are trying to
survive in places so frightening...

30:53.430 --> 30:54.426
Hello.

30:54.830 --> 30:55.946
'Qaseem, it's me.'

30:56.886 --> 30:58.100
Molly Dawes.

30:59.202 --> 31:02.277
'I'm sorry to call you... I
just wanted to talk to you.'

31:03.070 --> 31:04.620
Did you get my e-mail?

31:05.407 --> 31:06.940
Yeah. What's happened?

31:06.990 --> 31:08.764
'I'm trying to track her down.

31:09.195 --> 31:12.756
The authorities say that they moved her

31:13.596 --> 31:15.338
from the first house

31:16.156 --> 31:17.898
because she was in danger.'

31:19.656 --> 31:23.005
Qaseem, we have to find her. We
have to make sure she's safe.'

31:25.390 --> 31:27.350
How the hell do we do that?

31:50.390 --> 31:52.827
You deserve another medal
for tackling this kitchen.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.752
There was a lump of Marmite
under that window that

31:55.752 --> 31:57.720
I swear was there before I went on tour.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.672
Well, I'm such a slovenly madam.

32:10.270 --> 32:12.053
I'm dying, Mum.

32:13.104 --> 32:14.917
What are you saying?

32:15.990 --> 32:17.853
What you talking about, Moll?

32:18.467 --> 32:20.940
- Don't be daft.
- I'm not a hero.

32:21.264 --> 32:22.190
What?

32:22.215 --> 32:25.207
I dunno whether what I done
in Afghan was good or bad.

32:25.229 --> 32:29.022
I'm just worried that I put that
little girl's life in danger.

32:29.210 --> 32:30.630
What little girl?

32:32.667 --> 32:34.491
I killed her father.

32:38.821 --> 32:40.663
What have they done to you, Molly?

32:40.911 --> 32:43.222
I'll look after you, baby.
I'll always look after you.

32:43.239 --> 32:46.830
- You're with your family now.
- I had her taken away from her family, Mum.

32:47.386 --> 32:50.220
I just need to know that she's all right.

32:50.270 --> 32:53.220
It's all got to have been
for something hasn't it, Mum?

32:53.270 --> 32:55.270
Yeah, well, you're home
now, you're with me.

32:55.299 --> 32:58.167
I dunno what I was thinking,
Mum. It just all seemed possible.

32:58.190 --> 33:00.352
Everything just seemed possible on tour.

33:00.363 --> 33:02.525
And coming home is like...

33:03.110 --> 33:05.328
coming home is like waking up.

33:05.990 --> 33:07.470
Oh, Molly.

33:57.219 --> 33:58.468
You look beautiful

33:58.507 --> 34:00.332
You don't look too shabby yourself.

34:01.715 --> 34:02.699
Even with a limp.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.562
Especially with a limp.

34:04.745 --> 34:05.801
It's cute.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.206
I can see it's a nice place.

34:29.790 --> 34:30.820
The restaurant?

34:30.870 --> 34:32.100
No, Bath and that.

34:32.150 --> 34:34.337
Yes... Yeah, it is.

34:34.978 --> 34:36.580
So are you going to stay here then, Boss?

34:37.136 --> 34:38.380
Charles.

34:38.650 --> 34:39.989
Charles?

34:40.310 --> 34:41.670
Are you smirking?

34:42.588 --> 34:43.301
No.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.408
What's so fucking hilarious about Charles?

34:45.618 --> 34:48.328
What are you going to do? Call me
Boss Man for the rest of our lives?

34:51.310 --> 34:53.398
- A bit previous there, weren't you?
- Well...

34:53.824 --> 34:55.079
it's chemistry.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.389
I failed that.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.830
Well, you know what I mean.

34:59.485 --> 35:01.155
Do you want me to choose for you?

35:02.283 --> 35:03.279
No.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.749
So are you going to stay in Bath then...

35:13.027 --> 35:14.072
Charles?

35:15.697 --> 35:18.650
I've got some rehab at
Headley Court and then...

35:18.770 --> 35:19.739
yeah...

35:20.015 --> 35:21.381
back here for a bit.

35:21.763 --> 35:24.270
There's worse places
to be holed up, I guess.

35:33.978 --> 35:35.427
Thanks.

35:37.750 --> 35:38.870
Cheers.

35:41.415 --> 35:43.002
So how's being back home?

35:43.980 --> 35:44.804
Coping?

35:44.924 --> 35:48.065
Well, obviously it's a different
ball bag with you and that

35:48.353 --> 35:50.581
but being back with my parents...

35:51.110 --> 35:53.224
I just can't sit still.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.961
I can't get a calmness in my night.

35:56.081 --> 35:57.316
It just feels wrong.

35:57.630 --> 35:59.140
Has your CO been in touch?

35:59.190 --> 36:01.607
He forwards me on MOD trials and

36:01.811 --> 36:03.762
things that I might be interested in.

36:03.779 --> 36:05.095
They want to keep you in.

36:06.704 --> 36:08.467
- What about you?
- Nah,

36:08.587 --> 36:10.690
I don't think sitting behind a desk is

36:10.810 --> 36:12.526
- my kind of bag.
- Ooh, not half.

36:12.531 --> 36:15.075
Sitting behind a desk does
my head in ever since school.

36:15.110 --> 36:16.169
There you go.

36:16.512 --> 36:19.426
Kinship is just as
undeniable as the difference.

36:20.430 --> 36:22.483
- Whatever.
- I mean...

36:23.058 --> 36:24.944
maybe we're more alike than we know.

36:25.064 --> 36:26.885
That was obvious from being on tour.

36:38.281 --> 36:40.409
Did you just wipe cabbage on my hand?

36:40.846 --> 36:42.676
I didn't want to soil the napkin.

36:53.547 --> 36:55.416
What happened on tour...

36:56.892 --> 36:58.489
I know I failed you...

36:58.609 --> 37:00.043
I failed myself.

37:00.060 --> 37:01.380
You're not to blame, Molly.

37:01.430 --> 37:02.830
It all just fell to shit.

37:04.750 --> 37:08.016
I hear Afghan when I
shut my eyes to sleep and

37:08.364 --> 37:10.430
- when I wake up...
- You think you're back there.

37:11.532 --> 37:12.937
I don't know.

37:13.556 --> 37:15.132
I don't know where I am.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.952
I'm all over the shop.

37:20.450 --> 37:22.557
Which roles has your CO sent you?

37:24.227 --> 37:25.420
It doesn't matter.

37:26.018 --> 37:27.793
I thought I saw one about...

37:27.913 --> 37:29.762
mentoring Afghan medics.

37:33.470 --> 37:35.960
- Don't you want me to stay with you?
- I want you to be brilliant.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.603
What does that even mean?

37:38.830 --> 37:40.002
Well, it means...

37:41.738 --> 37:42.849
I love you.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.594
You don't know me. You
only know the me on tour.

37:48.633 --> 37:49.938
You can only see the tip of an iceberg,

37:49.950 --> 37:51.348
but you still know it's an iceberg.

37:51.392 --> 37:53.260
Are you calling me an iceberg?

37:55.035 --> 37:57.670
Well, I'd be on that plane
with you, given half the chance.

38:00.614 --> 38:02.052
You think I should go.

38:02.870 --> 38:04.446
I don't think you've got a choice.

38:05.430 --> 38:07.448
You're part way through a journey.

38:09.218 --> 38:10.780
I'm looking for something.

38:11.225 --> 38:13.878
I'm just crapping myself
at what I might find.

38:13.998 --> 38:16.980
And you're not going to
find it stuck here with me.

38:17.832 --> 38:20.044
Driving me back and forth to rehab.

38:21.190 --> 38:22.538
I can't drive.

38:35.134 --> 38:36.445
I'm all right. Thank you.

38:40.670 --> 38:42.848
I've been desperate to kiss you

38:43.462 --> 38:45.370
since we first kissed.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.046
My parents are at Lake Garda.

38:50.257 --> 38:51.661
The house is empty.

38:54.946 --> 38:55.980
What's funny?

38:56.909 --> 38:59.297
- There is nothing funny about that.
- It's just the way you said it,

38:59.314 --> 39:01.542
like you were desperate to lure me back.

39:04.270 --> 39:06.030
Well, did it work?

39:08.073 --> 39:10.777
Well, I thought I was going to
have to go halves on a Travelodge.

40:27.084 --> 40:28.300
What is it?

40:28.532 --> 40:30.263
What did we have on our first ever date?

40:30.523 --> 40:33.071
- Wimpy on the Barking Road.
- Exactly.

40:33.486 --> 40:35.400
- Ice cream floaters!
- Yes!

40:37.830 --> 40:38.830
Door!

40:46.870 --> 40:48.879
What is it, kittens?

40:48.999 --> 40:50.610
How do you work that one out?

40:50.908 --> 40:52.097
What is it, then?

40:52.955 --> 40:54.155
Who ordered that?

40:54.382 --> 40:55.311
Here,

40:55.482 --> 40:58.679
- did you order anything, Mother?
- Relax dad. It's for me.

40:59.182 --> 41:02.394
Right, come on you sad
Welsh twat. Where are you?

41:05.015 --> 41:08.576
We are going to Vegas, for a laugh.

41:12.607 --> 41:14.255
How much are the flights, then?

41:14.492 --> 41:16.256
I dunno. It's a bit confusing.

41:16.270 --> 41:18.539
Like 700 odd quid by the looks of it.

41:18.556 --> 41:20.980
That's for economy.
We're not going economy.

41:21.030 --> 41:22.388
Hark at you.

41:23.079 --> 41:25.916
Premium economy, a grand and a bit.

41:26.148 --> 41:27.846
Five grand for Upper Class.

41:27.966 --> 41:29.380
That's a bit more like us, innit?

41:29.430 --> 41:31.727
- No.
- Come on! My treat!

41:31.772 --> 41:34.061
You ain't spending that
amount of dough on flights.

41:34.181 --> 41:35.703
I'll go with you instead, Smurf.

41:35.823 --> 41:37.820
Seriously, mate, you'll have
a lot better time with me.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.014
Thanks, Dad.

41:39.036 --> 41:42.227
Do they really call it
"Upper Class"? That's sick.

41:42.260 --> 41:45.283
Yeah, they might as well call
the other two Middle Class

41:45.322 --> 41:47.075
and Lower Class and just be done!

41:47.445 --> 41:49.492
Well, I'm booking Upper Class.

41:49.541 --> 41:51.549
I've got loads of money to get rid of.

41:51.669 --> 41:53.980
This screen's really doing my nut in.

41:54.507 --> 41:56.180
You might be going to need glasses.

41:56.230 --> 41:58.260
Oh, don't say that! Do you reckon?

41:58.305 --> 42:00.257
- You getting headaches, Smurf?
- Yeah!

42:00.527 --> 42:01.605
Well, that's it, then.

42:01.661 --> 42:04.276
- You need glasses.
- Jeez, what's next?

42:04.396 --> 42:07.024
- Grey pubes?
- Ha, ha! She's got them, ain't you, Belinda!?

42:07.310 --> 42:08.284
Try them.

42:08.716 --> 42:10.939
You'd look all right in specs.

42:18.230 --> 42:20.200
Fucking cockneys!

42:26.583 --> 42:29.140
You just see them on the telly
all the time and I dunno...

42:29.651 --> 42:31.205
I could never get tired of being in one!

42:31.227 --> 42:32.234
A black taxi?

42:32.278 --> 42:33.716
Yeah, I can't stand London

42:33.727 --> 42:35.806
but I love buses and black cabs.

42:35.926 --> 42:37.056
You have to pay, you know.

42:37.078 --> 42:38.630
I've got loads of money.

42:38.903 --> 42:40.180
No class, mind!

42:40.556 --> 42:41.723
That's true.

42:46.030 --> 42:48.980
Not long now, Molls, and you'll be
in there hobnobbing with them all.

42:49.165 --> 42:51.180
I don't think you sit round having a cuppa.

42:51.454 --> 42:53.780
Will you mention me? To Her Majesty?

42:54.611 --> 42:57.364
Yeah, I'll tell her what
a prize pranny you are.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.373
For Queen and country.

43:02.219 --> 43:04.060
That's what it's all been about, Moll.

43:17.502 --> 43:18.780
Will you stay in?

43:18.830 --> 43:20.073
Only till I'm better.

43:20.626 --> 43:22.654
I've got to go and see a psychiatrist.

43:22.887 --> 43:23.860
Really?

43:23.980 --> 43:27.968
Yeah, I mentioned I been having
these dreams... real vivid.

43:28.088 --> 43:29.554
Do you know what I mean?

43:29.910 --> 43:30.997
About Afghan?

43:31.117 --> 43:32.076
Yeah.

43:32.374 --> 43:34.149
Reliving it every night.

43:34.183 --> 43:36.217
Wake up and the bed's soaking.

43:36.489 --> 43:38.660
I've got to talk it all
through with someone.

43:39.159 --> 43:40.558
We're all fragged.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.150
How can we not be?

43:43.910 --> 43:46.109
What are you going to do after you leave?

43:46.596 --> 43:48.740
My uncle's got a garage in Merthyr.

43:49.145 --> 43:51.495
He's going to fix me up
to do an apprenticeship.

43:52.042 --> 43:54.486
To be honest, I only joined
up because of my brother.

43:55.222 --> 43:57.340
I don't want to put me
mum through another tour.

43:57.566 --> 43:59.274
Yeah, it's probably a good call.

43:59.827 --> 44:01.845
I dunno if I'm ready to quit yet.

44:03.470 --> 44:05.550
You're still bloody
coming to Vegas with me.

44:05.622 --> 44:07.552
Especially after I
splashed out on that dress.

44:07.590 --> 44:09.857
How did you know what size I was?

44:10.974 --> 44:12.268
I asked my mum.

44:12.870 --> 44:15.326
Yeah, I am bloody coming to Vegas with you.

44:15.574 --> 44:16.979
As my best mate.

44:17.604 --> 44:19.163
As your best mate.

44:19.870 --> 44:21.380
More than happy with that.

44:22.215 --> 44:26.489
I know you've set your sights a bit
above wife of mechanic in Merthyr.

44:31.648 --> 44:34.025
I've got something that will impress you.

44:35.883 --> 44:37.470
Oh...

44:38.609 --> 44:41.820
Oh, ho, ho.

44:41.870 --> 44:44.049
OK,

44:44.287 --> 44:46.250
I'm a bit impressed!

44:46.974 --> 44:48.900
I'm a war hero. Apparently.

44:49.838 --> 44:53.648
Imagine standing out here in front of
30 odd thousand people on a match day.

44:53.768 --> 44:55.544
I haven't said I'll do it yet.

44:56.036 --> 44:57.230
You've got to.

44:57.236 --> 45:00.028
- Besides, I've only got to walk around the edge.
- Ah,

45:00.199 --> 45:02.825
people love soldiers nowadays. Go for it.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.762
My dad's keen cos he gets a free ticket!

45:06.270 --> 45:07.660
He's proud of you.

45:07.710 --> 45:11.407
I dunno... I just don't
feel like a hero and...

45:12.030 --> 45:13.625
I find it all a bit embarrassing.

45:13.745 --> 45:16.998
You saved me and your local
club wants to honour you.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.485
Don't let them down.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.929
There's a big life ahead and you
might not get another opportunity.

45:21.365 --> 45:23.201
It is a big life ahead, isn't it?

45:23.770 --> 45:25.009
Yes, mate.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.724
You got to run at life like
you're running into the unknown...

45:29.040 --> 45:31.406
cos that is what you're doing, I suppose.

45:31.799 --> 45:33.413
You never know what's round the corner.

45:33.430 --> 45:35.166
It could be a cliff, could be a...

45:35.735 --> 45:38.185
I dunno. Just ignore me.

45:38.915 --> 45:40.745
Everything's going to work out for you,

45:41.519 --> 45:42.481
I know it.

45:42.785 --> 45:45.905
If I ever buy a car, can I come
to Merthyr and have a free service?

45:45.971 --> 45:48.194
Hm... mates' rates.

45:48.365 --> 45:50.289
Not free. Don't push it.

45:52.982 --> 45:55.951
And the Smurfoid takes on one man,

45:56.071 --> 45:59.837
beats another and... shoots!

45:59.887 --> 46:01.940
Goooaaal!

46:01.990 --> 46:09.436
Bingo! Goal! West Ham 0, Newport 3!

46:14.711 --> 46:16.647
Smurf, what are you doing?

46:19.470 --> 46:20.460
Smurf?

46:23.465 --> 46:26.008
Sometimes I dream he's still alive and

46:26.053 --> 46:28.441
I wake up and I wonder if somebody's dead.

46:28.468 --> 46:29.873
Smurf, what's the matter?

46:31.609 --> 46:34.777
Smurf, I can't understand a
word of what you're saying...

46:35.187 --> 46:39.123
Smurf, Smurf, talk to me.
Where does it hurt, Smurf?

46:39.422 --> 46:41.147
Smurf, talk to me, OK.

46:42.153 --> 46:44.354
Don't do this, don't fucking do this!

46:44.474 --> 46:46.538
Someone get me an ambulance!

46:46.658 --> 46:48.528
Smurf, just stay with me, all right.

46:48.648 --> 46:49.816
Smurf, talk to me.

46:49.888 --> 46:50.828
Smurf.

46:51.154 --> 46:52.304
Smurf...

46:53.134 --> 46:54.041
Smurf...

47:59.910 --> 48:02.181
"Every morning when I wake,

48:02.733 --> 48:04.959
Dear Lord, a little prayer I make,

48:06.230 --> 48:08.436
O please do keep Thy lovely eye

48:08.892 --> 48:11.138
On all poor creatures born to die.

48:12.270 --> 48:14.857
And every evening at sun-down

48:15.112 --> 48:17.656
I ask a blessing on the town,

48:18.990 --> 48:20.828
For whether we last the night

48:21.173 --> 48:23.772
or no I'm sure is always touch-and-go.

48:25.110 --> 48:27.850
We are not wholly bad or good

48:28.728 --> 48:30.820
Who live our lives under Milk Wood

48:31.493 --> 48:33.919
And Thou, I know, wilt be the first

48:34.630 --> 48:37.063
To see our best side, not our worst.

48:38.430 --> 48:40.180
O let us see another day!

48:40.401 --> 48:42.670
And bless us all this night, I pray,

48:44.710 --> 48:46.683
And to the sun we all will bow

48:47.844 --> 48:49.579
And say goodbye

48:51.390 --> 48:52.896
but just for now."

49:07.515 --> 49:09.616
I gave the Army my boys.

49:10.839 --> 49:13.182
And they gave me back a flag.

49:37.807 --> 49:39.259
How are you doing?

49:40.779 --> 49:42.389
I feel so sad.

49:42.673 --> 49:44.242
How did it go unnoticed?

49:44.470 --> 49:47.089
It was such a tiny bleed in his brain...

49:47.303 --> 49:50.380
that sometimes things are so
small that you don't notice them.

49:50.731 --> 49:53.137
Apparently the stress of his shooting

49:53.137 --> 49:55.072
could have made the haemorrhage worse.

49:55.618 --> 49:56.661
Who knows?

49:57.311 --> 49:58.942
I knew he wasn't right.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.036
He wasn't himself.

50:01.057 --> 50:03.047
I just thought he was nervous and

50:03.167 --> 50:04.865
fragged like the rest of us.

50:04.927 --> 50:07.620
I didn't realise it was... serious.

50:07.996 --> 50:10.201
If there's anything I can ever do...

50:10.750 --> 50:12.447
Have you got a TARDIS?

50:14.376 --> 50:16.048
I've taken your advice.

50:16.083 --> 50:17.507
I've got a short tour.

50:18.470 --> 50:19.864
Afghan?

50:20.617 --> 50:22.124
You need to sort it out.

50:22.760 --> 50:24.709
Your world, and everything in it.

50:25.400 --> 50:26.748
OK?

50:35.083 --> 50:36.710
'You're nearly there.'

51:14.809 --> 51:16.860
So you think I'm crazy too, then?

51:16.910 --> 51:20.152
The rest of us are heading out
of here... you've come back!

51:20.190 --> 51:21.990
I'm training Afghan medics.

51:22.032 --> 51:24.506
So I'll be back in Nuneaton
and you'll be in Kabul.

51:24.548 --> 51:25.875
Exactly.

51:26.089 --> 51:28.267
You take care, for God's sake!

51:32.390 --> 51:33.948
It just feels right.

51:40.110 --> 51:42.060
They used to talk about the "golden hour",

51:42.110 --> 51:44.999
how we as medics had the
first hour to treat the patient

51:45.013 --> 51:46.865
to intervene to save their lives.

51:46.985 --> 51:49.456
Now the talk is of the
"platinum ten minutes",

51:49.498 --> 51:52.214
and if you think about the
narrow window of opportunity

51:52.242 --> 51:54.619
it kind of highlights the need
for prompt action in the field

51:54.640 --> 51:58.641
in order to minimise the loss
of limb or life in Afghanistan.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.432
'I've found her.'

52:10.790 --> 52:12.091
I want to see her, then.

52:12.110 --> 52:14.420
Please, Molly, it can never happen.

52:14.470 --> 52:17.019
Yes, it can. I've been
excused the VIP lunch.

52:17.030 --> 52:19.276
- We've got two hours.
- Then we sit here and talk.

52:19.278 --> 52:21.082
Qaseem, don't do this to me. Let's go.

52:21.117 --> 52:24.408
She is fine. We have moved
her into a safe place.

52:24.528 --> 52:26.336
Good. I look forward to seeing it.

52:26.343 --> 52:29.053
You don't have to compromise your
safety to see what I am telling you.

52:29.173 --> 52:31.720
Yes, I do. Please, come on.

52:33.559 --> 52:36.082
I'll go on my own, Qaseem.
You know that, don't you?

52:37.706 --> 52:38.790
Yes.

52:49.947 --> 52:52.460
You couldn't have just written
to her like any normal person?

52:52.510 --> 52:54.900
I ain't a normal person,
Qaseem. You know that.

52:54.950 --> 52:56.580
This is true.

52:56.907 --> 52:59.257
I'm giving you my 14 grand deployment money

52:59.562 --> 53:03.260
so that she can have an education and
everything that she needs to have a life.

53:03.819 --> 53:07.180
Besides, I know you won't spend
it on wine, women and song.

53:07.801 --> 53:09.743
I like a nice song.

53:13.030 --> 53:15.383
You will look after her for me, won't you?

53:37.514 --> 53:38.751
The guards know me.

53:38.986 --> 53:40.942
I will tell them you are my wife.

53:40.997 --> 53:43.748
Can't I just be your
glamorous younger sister?

53:45.350 --> 53:47.439
The children do lessons in the morning

53:47.559 --> 53:49.817
and then they come into
that courtyard there.

53:49.870 --> 53:52.498
When they arrive, we walk out...

53:52.618 --> 53:54.537
I talk to the guards.

53:56.390 --> 53:58.608
You have one minute with Bashira

53:58.989 --> 54:00.710
and then back in the car.

54:18.348 --> 54:21.106
OK, the children are coming.

54:21.226 --> 54:23.255
I will open the door for you.

54:52.192 --> 54:55.095
- How are you?
- Hi.

54:55.151 --> 54:59.629
You well? Good to see
you... This is my wife.

55:00.465 --> 55:05.711
We have just come to see Bashira.
Just for a few moments. Go.

55:53.630 --> 55:55.420
What, you're not going to talk to her?

55:55.791 --> 55:57.510
Look at her, Qaseem.

56:12.910 --> 56:14.230
Bashira.

56:16.830 --> 56:18.198
Molly!

56:34.101 --> 56:35.622
Right, listen up.

56:36.168 --> 56:39.457
Stay alert, stay focused, stay alive.

56:39.775 --> 56:43.065
Disasters happen when
we are not 100% on it.

56:43.120 --> 56:45.913
We lose lives through
catastrophic bleeding.

56:46.121 --> 56:48.416
Our actions in the first few moments

56:48.423 --> 56:50.460
will either save a life or lose a life.

56:50.510 --> 56:53.061
You are the most important
people on the ground.
