00:05.313 --> 00:08.550
Maybe one of your friends
would like to go home instead?

00:10.980 --> 00:12.781
They're coming in, I just opened the gate.

00:12.782 --> 00:13.978
- You let the cops in!
- What the fuck!

00:14.003 --> 00:15.745
I had no choice.
Gus was about to give us up.

00:15.770 --> 00:18.092
Go! Stop them! Stop!

00:19.440 --> 00:21.074
Come on!

00:21.075 --> 00:22.543
Hey, hey, look.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.598
Maybe we should just talk out here.

00:23.623 --> 00:26.547
Okay. What would you like to say?

00:26.548 --> 00:28.116
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:28.117 --> 00:30.784
- How are you?
- Good.

00:30.785 --> 00:32.686
What's going on, Gus?

00:32.686 --> 00:34.855
About to ask you the same question, Lex.

00:34.856 --> 00:36.722
Um, is there a problem?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.151
He won't fit. He won't fit.

00:39.152 --> 00:40.518
Okay, okay.

00:40.519 --> 00:43.046
Hey, we're gonna cut off his feet.

00:43.071 --> 00:44.360
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:44.385 --> 00:45.812
Go get the biggest knife you can find.

00:45.813 --> 00:46.841
- Oh, my God.
- Do it!

00:46.842 --> 00:48.876
We have started an official investigation

00:48.877 --> 00:50.711
into the-the missing boat.

00:50.712 --> 00:52.847
Yeah, we... but we told you,

00:52.848 --> 00:54.815
uh, that we didn't know
anything about any boat.

00:54.816 --> 00:56.955
Oh? Because your friend seemed to think

00:56.956 --> 00:58.337
you might be able to help.

00:58.338 --> 01:00.735
Help... help answer any questions.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.762
Didn't know exactly what and, again,

01:03.763 --> 01:06.732
we don't anything about a missing boat.

01:07.459 --> 01:09.167
That's perfect. All right, you got him?

01:09.168 --> 01:11.470
- Okay.
- Wait.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.205
- Wouldn't it be quicker to...
- What?

01:14.206 --> 01:16.074
- No.
- What?

01:16.075 --> 01:17.976
- No.
- What?!

01:17.977 --> 01:20.039
Cut off his head?

01:20.064 --> 01:21.613
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

01:21.614 --> 01:24.117
Great, okay.
Okay.

01:24.142 --> 01:24.718
Ready? Here we go.

01:24.743 --> 01:25.876
- One...
- Ugh.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.911
Ah, I can't do it!

01:27.912 --> 01:30.046
Maybe we can talk inside.

01:30.047 --> 01:31.515
Uh, but I know you said,

01:31.516 --> 01:34.418
um, you wanted to speak to Milo, right?

01:34.419 --> 01:36.453
But, uh, he's not back yet,

01:36.454 --> 01:38.355
and the other guys went to bed,

01:38.356 --> 01:42.193
so why don't we just, uh, talk out here?

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

01:57.209 --> 01:58.826
It seems the guys have gotten up.

02:03.434 --> 02:05.203
To make cocktails or something.

02:05.570 --> 02:06.570
Great.

02:06.726 --> 02:07.930
Let's have a drink.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

02:27.871 --> 02:29.197
You're not in bed.

02:29.906 --> 02:31.610
And no cocktails.

02:31.635 --> 02:34.436
Uh, she wanted to, uh,
ask some more questions

02:34.437 --> 02:36.126
about the, um, uh, the missing boat.

02:36.127 --> 02:38.274
Hey, didn't know we had company.

02:38.275 --> 02:40.342
I will like, if you don't mind,

02:40.343 --> 02:42.673
to interview you one by one.

02:43.881 --> 02:46.283
Which one of you will talk first?

03:48.922 --> 03:51.424
Your name and address, please.

03:56.015 --> 03:58.051
What do you do for work?

03:58.712 --> 04:01.349
Uh, I-I-I teach.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.254
I-I used to be a teacher.

04:07.255 --> 04:11.025
Now, I mainly... I mainly teach teachers.

04:11.026 --> 04:12.784
I... I teach teachers...

04:13.776 --> 04:15.143
teaching.

04:15.144 --> 04:16.635
Do you enjoy it?

04:16.660 --> 04:18.978
It's a job.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.851
I-I need ice.

04:24.554 --> 04:27.022
I think your fridge is not working

04:27.023 --> 04:29.759
or maybe just empty.

04:33.752 --> 04:37.752
Milo is in-in Guatemala, in which town?

04:38.222 --> 04:40.194
He didn't say.

04:43.225 --> 04:45.760
But you asked him.

04:47.562 --> 04:50.964
I don't remember the name,
but yeah, yeah, we asked him.

04:50.965 --> 04:53.763
No, we did not ask because
it's none of our business.

04:54.369 --> 04:55.420
Mm-hmm.

04:57.444 --> 05:01.138
Milo's business is in real estate, right?

05:01.303 --> 05:03.783
Yes, buying and selling property.

05:03.784 --> 05:06.016
- That is all he does.
- No.

05:06.017 --> 05:08.931
Milo has his fingers in a lot of pies.

05:09.533 --> 05:10.667
Which pies?

05:10.668 --> 05:13.736
Hmm, investments, stock speculations.

05:13.737 --> 05:17.707
Uh, he and I both, uh,
play the markets a little.

05:17.708 --> 05:21.708
Stock market? No.
No, just, uh, real estate.

05:25.504 --> 05:28.973
Which of you would you say is...

05:28.974 --> 05:30.989
is closest to Milo?

05:32.388 --> 05:35.290
I guess, I am. I mean,
I've known him the longest.

05:35.291 --> 05:38.460
- Lex.
- Lex.

05:38.461 --> 05:41.270
- Me.
- And you, what do you do?

05:41.575 --> 05:42.676
I deal in antiques.

05:42.903 --> 05:45.905
And up until a few years ago,
I practiced law

05:45.906 --> 05:48.975
and I'm pretty sure this right here,

05:48.976 --> 05:51.683
without a warrant, not exactly legal.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.201
You know about law.

05:53.202 --> 05:54.721
That's what I just said.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.739
You rented a car.

06:00.377 --> 06:02.612
- From the airport.
- Yes.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.968
So where is it? I didn't see it outside.

06:07.969 --> 06:11.969
Well, um, we drove into
town last night and, uh,

06:12.573 --> 06:16.573
got a little drunk so, um,
we left it in town,

06:17.140 --> 06:18.389
took a taxi back.

06:19.223 --> 06:21.258
So where-where is the car?

06:24.915 --> 06:26.332
The craziest thing.

06:26.333 --> 06:30.320
Uh, we can't really remember where it is

06:30.321 --> 06:32.322
because we got pretty drunk.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.600
We had a good time.

06:36.727 --> 06:39.701
Would you like us to find it?

06:40.202 --> 06:41.669
No, no, that's fine.

06:41.670 --> 06:43.805
We have an idea where,
I think I know the street.

06:43.806 --> 06:45.907
It's got... there's a gas station that's...

06:45.908 --> 06:48.410
It's-it's very easy, very easy.

06:48.411 --> 06:51.480
No, it's fine. We'll get it. Thank you.

06:52.415 --> 06:54.717
Your name and address, please.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.133
How about this?

06:59.134 --> 07:03.134
How about you, uh, you write down your name

07:04.212 --> 07:07.046
and badge number and your superior's name?

07:07.047 --> 07:11.047
Because where I'm from,
this is not how it's done.

07:12.052 --> 07:15.090
You know what, if you're
going to question us,

07:15.091 --> 07:16.490
I think we should have a lawyer

07:16.491 --> 07:18.004
or somebody from the embassy present.

07:18.156 --> 07:20.825
I thought your-your friend
used to be a lawyer.

07:20.826 --> 07:22.493
Gus, right.

07:22.494 --> 07:25.397
I'm not sure I want to take
legal advice from him.

07:28.328 --> 07:32.328
Why you think you need to call a lawyer?

07:32.966 --> 07:35.169
Have you done something wrong?

07:36.960 --> 07:38.110
No.

07:38.638 --> 07:42.441
We're four friends on vacation.

07:42.442 --> 07:45.245
And you're very close.

07:47.314 --> 07:49.818
Yep, super tight.

07:50.195 --> 07:51.450
No.

07:51.655 --> 07:53.341
Some of us are closer than others.

07:53.912 --> 07:57.481
Close? Us?

07:58.817 --> 08:01.998
Okay. We know you have plane reservations,

08:02.085 --> 08:03.318
leave on Monday night,

08:03.319 --> 08:06.621
the 6:00 PM flight via Houston.

08:06.622 --> 08:07.944
You tell her that, too, Gus?

08:07.975 --> 08:09.924
While we continue our investigation,

08:09.925 --> 08:11.921
I must ask you not
to leave Belize before then.

08:12.053 --> 08:13.520
What if we do?

08:14.163 --> 08:15.702
You will be detained at the airport.

08:15.867 --> 08:19.570
Why? Because of some missing
boat we know nothing about?

08:19.806 --> 08:21.243
How can I explain?

08:22.025 --> 08:24.149
You're not in the United States.

08:24.494 --> 08:28.494
The person the boat
belongs to is very savage.

08:28.721 --> 08:30.222
We are trying to solve a crime,

08:30.223 --> 08:31.958
but we are also trying to protect

08:31.959 --> 08:33.525
whoever stole the boat

08:33.525 --> 08:36.227
because clearly they do not
understand what they did.

08:36.229 --> 08:37.589
Must be worth a lot of money then.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.500
JesÃºs is a man of principle.

08:39.501 --> 08:42.870
Whether he's owed a lot or a
little, he will seek atonement.

08:42.871 --> 08:46.240
Doesn't matter if
the person is here in Belize

08:46.241 --> 08:47.690
or even in the United States.

08:47.715 --> 08:50.245
He has many associates.

08:51.721 --> 08:55.225
When Milo returns, ask him to call me.

09:00.841 --> 09:04.811
Ay, and don't worry, Lex,

09:04.812 --> 09:06.914
I'll find your car.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.136
What's she talking about, find our car?

09:37.161 --> 09:38.964
She saw the rental car keys on the table.

09:38.965 --> 09:40.746
- She asked where it was.
- What'd you say?

09:40.771 --> 09:42.489
- I said we lost it.
- Why'd you say that?

09:42.528 --> 09:44.536
I didn't know what to say
so I said we didn't know

09:44.513 --> 09:46.018
where it was.
Who are you calling? Who are you calling?

09:46.043 --> 09:47.309
Operator, I would like to be connected

09:47.310 --> 09:48.729
to the American embassy, please.

09:48.730 --> 09:51.103
By the way, who opened up the damn gate?

09:51.104 --> 09:52.275
I did.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.080
Oh, of course you did.
Why doesn't that surprise me?

09:54.237 --> 09:55.736
I'm sorry, what are you trying to say, Gus?

09:55.737 --> 09:57.807
I'm saying that for as
long as we've known you,

09:57.808 --> 10:00.009
you've always been the one
to do retarded shit like that

10:00.010 --> 10:01.645
that we...

10:03.647 --> 10:05.047
...have to clean up.

10:05.048 --> 10:07.884
We heard everything you were saying to her.

10:07.885 --> 10:11.253
What-what... you-you-you-you
think that I was...

10:11.254 --> 10:13.297
English.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.350
Option one.

10:15.351 --> 10:17.908
They're closed. Want me to leave a message.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.658
Then leave one. Leave one.

10:19.659 --> 10:21.691
Okay, My-my name is...

10:21.692 --> 10:22.925
Don't...

10:22.926 --> 10:24.526
I'm an American citizen.

10:24.527 --> 10:28.497
Uh, I-I came here with a friend-a friend...

10:28.498 --> 10:30.266
Wait...

10:31.257 --> 10:34.759
There was this-this cat.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.807
How the hell am I going
to explain this shit?

10:35.808 --> 10:37.307
Wait a second, wait a second.

10:37.354 --> 10:39.430
She's just gone to...

10:39.431 --> 10:40.705
to look for a car rented in our names.

10:40.940 --> 10:41.471
My name.

10:41.628 --> 10:45.628
With millions of euros of
drug money sitting in the trunk.

10:54.141 --> 10:57.778
Do you realize we have less

10:57.779 --> 10:59.914
than four hours to return the boat?

11:13.533 --> 11:16.135
Hey, I-I don't-I don't
know if you remember me...

11:16.136 --> 11:17.414
You don't think I remember you?

11:17.439 --> 11:19.273
Yeah, I-I rented a car from you earlier.

11:19.274 --> 11:21.608
I misplaced the keys and I was wondering

11:21.609 --> 11:22.944
if you had an extra set.

11:22.945 --> 11:26.945
I'll put it on your bill.

11:28.944 --> 11:32.944
So, um, what was all this retarded shit

11:33.616 --> 11:35.669
you had to clean up? I'm-I'm curious.

11:37.224 --> 11:39.364
Really? Right here.

11:39.427 --> 11:40.497
Why not?

11:42.060 --> 11:43.962
Totaling a friend's motorcycle

11:43.963 --> 11:46.921
and asking us to lie and
say that it was stolen.

11:46.922 --> 11:48.297
Asking us to cover for you

11:48.298 --> 11:50.774
because you're too damn
hungover to make it to class.

11:50.775 --> 11:54.775
Asking us to lend you our
CDs and clothes and-and-

11:55.309 --> 11:56.444
and-and apartments
knowing that

11:56.445 --> 11:59.295
it'd probably end up trashed or lost.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.654
- Vouching for you.
- Vouching for me. Wow.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.691
Interesting that you'd bring
that up 'cause here's

12:04.692 --> 12:07.427
a vouch I can think of that
didn't exactly pan out for me.

12:07.428 --> 12:08.928
Don't you think we
have more pressing things

12:08.929 --> 12:10.630
to deal with right now?

12:10.631 --> 12:13.600
Like getting the boat back
or dealing with this damn car

12:13.601 --> 12:15.252
that you just alerted the police to?

12:15.669 --> 12:16.854
Thank you.

12:17.839 --> 12:20.157
Southside Construction ring any bells?

12:20.158 --> 12:21.642
- What?
- You don't remember?

12:21.643 --> 12:22.810
I was in line for a management gig.

12:22.811 --> 12:24.278
I aced the interviews, then I asked you for

12:24.279 --> 12:26.180
a letter of recommendation
because you knew them.

12:26.181 --> 12:28.482
Yes, they were clients.
I gave them a letter.

12:28.483 --> 12:30.786
Got it, guys, let's go.

12:41.296 --> 12:43.097
Well, this doesn't look suspicious.

12:43.098 --> 12:44.531
Exactly, so let's hurry it up.

12:44.532 --> 12:46.000
Is it just me or does it bother anyone else

12:46.001 --> 12:47.094
that this money is short?

12:47.133 --> 12:48.493
Does it bother anyone else that JesÃºs

12:48.494 --> 12:49.829
has associates in the U.S.?

12:49.830 --> 12:51.289
Does it bother anybody else that the cops

12:51.314 --> 12:52.641
may show up at any moment?

12:52.673 --> 12:53.790
How much did you give fender bender woman?

12:53.869 --> 12:55.804
I didn't give fender bender woman anything.

12:55.805 --> 12:57.471
- She took it.
- How much?

12:57.472 --> 13:00.108
Uh, uh, a stack. At least a full stack.

13:00.109 --> 13:01.642
- I saw that.
- That's ten grand.

13:01.643 --> 13:04.625
We are not giving this
money back ten grand short.

13:04.626 --> 13:06.815
Follow me, please.

13:16.141 --> 13:18.397
Jerk.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.524
Hey, do you think Milo
knew what might happen

13:33.549 --> 13:35.079
when he invited us here?

13:35.111 --> 13:36.812
I wouldn't put it past him
to take us all down with him.

13:36.813 --> 13:38.032
No, no.

13:38.064 --> 13:39.529
I-I think it was a cry for help.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.498
I think he knew he was
in trouble, he was scared.

13:41.499 --> 13:44.068
He wanted his homies around him.

13:44.069 --> 13:46.270
Yeah, like I'm his homie.

13:46.271 --> 13:48.306
Where's he going?

13:50.767 --> 13:53.503
Why are we stopping?
Where's he going?

13:56.606 --> 13:58.174
Two minutes.

13:58.175 --> 14:00.143
I'm not here to cause
any distress or trouble,

14:00.144 --> 14:02.646
but I think it's important
you hear what I have to say.

14:04.181 --> 14:06.216
What the fuck is he doing?

14:09.386 --> 14:12.241
Oh, I think he's putting the squeeze

14:12.242 --> 14:13.280
on fender bender woman.

14:13.499 --> 14:14.999
I know you're not stupid.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.767
You know what that cash is about.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.569
I'm not here to pretend
that it's something else,

14:18.570 --> 14:22.570
but my concern is with that cash
comes a whole lot of trouble.

14:23.161 --> 14:25.910
This concern, it's for you or for me?

14:25.911 --> 14:28.703
For both. Look, I'm not a criminal.

14:28.704 --> 14:30.750
My buddies out there are not criminals.

14:30.751 --> 14:32.102
You think I couldn't tell that?

14:32.439 --> 14:35.675
Somehow we stumbled into
this cosmic fuck up

14:35.676 --> 14:36.862
and for whatever crazy ass reason,

14:36.863 --> 14:38.401
you've stumbled into it, too.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.612
I'm sorry, but if you don't
give back that cash,

14:41.613 --> 14:44.028
I promise you that we are both in danger.

14:47.118 --> 14:48.372
That's all I got.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.129
She's giving us back the money.

14:58.130 --> 14:58.994
- What?
- What?

14:59.019 --> 15:00.356
Wha...

15:02.960 --> 15:03.764
All right, I'm going with him.

15:03.765 --> 15:05.194
Wait, I don't think this
is such a good idea.

15:05.233 --> 15:07.832
You don't even know where you're going.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.801
Okay, we'll wait here.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.310
Coming to give me backup?

15:21.311 --> 15:23.615
Yeah, just like you
did when I needed that job.

15:23.616 --> 15:24.718
That was four fucking years ago.

15:24.719 --> 15:26.054
I know exactly when it was.

15:26.148 --> 15:28.850
I-I had a deposit on an
apartment, which I lost.

15:28.851 --> 15:30.419
Was gonna get a company car,

15:30.420 --> 15:32.120
had an opportunity to get my shit together

15:32.121 --> 15:34.175
after Kayla and all the other
crap that went down,

15:34.200 --> 15:37.426
and all I needed from... Aah! Ick.

15:37.427 --> 15:39.629
Mind the open sewer.

15:40.237 --> 15:41.404
Fuck!

15:49.872 --> 15:51.331
Okay.

15:52.141 --> 15:54.275
You know what I think we should do?

15:54.276 --> 15:56.643
Go sit outside the embassy

15:56.644 --> 15:58.097
and wait for it to open.

16:00.082 --> 16:04.082
And just leave them here?
What, what do you mean?

16:04.139 --> 16:08.139
Well, obviously wait for them to come back.

16:11.768 --> 16:14.537
Assuming they do come back.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.722
- All I needed was a letter.
- I gave them one.

16:28.723 --> 16:30.203
- Is that right?
- I wrote the letter.

16:30.243 --> 16:32.978
- I should know, Lex.
- And what did you say?

16:33.089 --> 16:34.489
I'm-I'm very curious.

16:34.551 --> 16:36.186
I said the typical shit that you would say

16:36.211 --> 16:38.011
in those kinds of letters.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.244
- We're here.
- Come in.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.222
Hi. Sorry.

16:53.223 --> 16:54.313
- Hey.
- Shut up now.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.892
Hello. Sorry.

16:56.893 --> 16:58.662
Grans?

17:04.111 --> 17:06.646
Shaved ice, cool you down, man?

17:06.646 --> 17:08.782
Uh, hey, we don't have any money so, uh,

17:08.784 --> 17:10.916
why don't you just leave?

17:10.917 --> 17:13.921
Uh, seriously, we don't have any cash.

17:16.915 --> 17:19.184
Here you go, a present from Belize.

17:20.819 --> 17:23.422
- Take care, man.
- Thank you.

17:37.275 --> 17:38.538
Good.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.528
Do you have any idea

17:46.529 --> 17:47.482
what ten grand would mean to these people?

17:47.686 --> 17:50.084
Do you have any idea how much
my hands and feet mean to me?

17:51.218 --> 17:54.287
My roof you're under! In my house!

17:55.094 --> 17:56.528
Grans!

18:01.200 --> 18:02.601
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

18:02.602 --> 18:03.734
- No.
- Most of it.

18:03.735 --> 18:05.241
- She gave us $6,500.
- What do you mean?

18:05.242 --> 18:07.187
Her grandmother spent the rest.

18:07.188 --> 18:08.214
Oh, bullshit!

18:08.847 --> 18:10.247
No, I don't-I don't buy it.

18:10.248 --> 18:12.749
Did you-did you threaten her, huh?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.517
What are you guys, men?

18:14.518 --> 18:15.505
Yes, that's-that's what we are.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.888
We're civilized men.

18:16.889 --> 18:19.341
So wait, we're still short $3,500.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.476
- Yeah.
- Can we grab it from an ATM?

18:21.477 --> 18:22.977
Oh, yeah. How much can you
grab out of an ATM, Lex?

18:22.978 --> 18:23.884
I don't know.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.980
How much can you grab from an ATM, Gus?

18:25.981 --> 18:27.682
ATMs are traceable.

18:27.683 --> 18:30.687
You can wire money anonymously.

18:30.688 --> 18:33.984
Okay, so who can we ask to, uh, send us

18:33.985 --> 18:36.691
3,500 bucks in the middle of the night?

18:37.214 --> 18:38.781
Well, I know who Gus called the last time

18:38.782 --> 18:40.082
he needed cash in a hurry.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.167
Oh, let's go and bring that up again.

18:41.168 --> 18:43.142
Look, I'm making a point.

18:43.143 --> 18:46.823
The people we all turn to
are us and we're all here.

18:46.824 --> 18:48.365
If I ask anybody I know

18:48.412 --> 18:51.093
to wire me money to Central America

18:51.094 --> 18:53.996
in the middle of the night,
they're gonna think...

18:53.997 --> 18:57.000
Nobody will, okay? So forget it.

19:02.754 --> 19:04.089
What?

19:04.839 --> 19:06.307
What?

19:06.441 --> 19:08.808
- Say it.
- Say what?

19:08.809 --> 19:12.580
I can get the money and you all know it.

19:13.595 --> 19:15.296
All right.

19:15.297 --> 19:17.933
Let's just leave the rental car someplace

19:17.934 --> 19:19.034
and just do it.

19:21.605 --> 19:23.305
He is very hot.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.775
A little privacy, please.

19:27.776 --> 19:29.930
Hi. Hello.

19:30.001 --> 19:32.949
Yeah, I'd like to place
a collect call, please.

19:34.483 --> 19:36.067
My friend is arranging

19:36.068 --> 19:39.421
a wire transfer from the U.S.

19:43.584 --> 19:45.085
She's not picking up the home phone

19:45.086 --> 19:46.486
and I don't know her cell.

19:46.487 --> 19:48.088
How could you not know
your wife's cell number?

19:48.089 --> 19:48.978
'Cause it was on my phone.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.458
Who memorizes cell phone numbers?

19:51.459 --> 19:52.460
What do I do?

19:54.533 --> 19:56.334
Yeah, can you just hold
on a second, please?

19:56.335 --> 19:58.102
Just one second.

19:58.103 --> 20:01.439
What? Well, we're just-
we're trying to figure it out.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.009
Can you please look up
a cell phone number for me?

20:05.010 --> 20:06.222
Is that... can you do that?

20:06.223 --> 20:08.925
Yeah, but it's in... I can't remember

20:08.926 --> 20:12.584
anybody's number to call
and ask for her number.

20:14.466 --> 20:15.767
Well, I know her name,

20:15.768 --> 20:17.669
I know the area code, I just can't...

20:17.670 --> 20:20.137
What? Hold on.

20:20.138 --> 20:21.401
Oh, what? Thanks.

20:21.426 --> 20:23.975
You knew it by heart?

20:23.976 --> 20:26.377
What? No, I got it, I got it.

20:26.378 --> 20:29.647
Yep. No, I'll punch it in.

20:38.965 --> 20:42.135
Helena? Hey, what?

20:42.160 --> 20:44.035
No, nothing's wrong.

20:44.036 --> 20:44.228
Yeah, I know.

20:44.229 --> 20:47.345
I dropped my phone in the pool
and so I just... I know, yeah.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.475
Look, I-I got to ask you a favor.

20:49.476 --> 20:52.378
What... Milo? Yeah, he's fine.

20:52.379 --> 20:53.771
He's great, mm-hmm.

20:53.881 --> 20:55.782
Yeah, he was actually saying
I should-I should, um,

20:55.783 --> 20:58.819
I should bring you down here, right?

20:59.751 --> 21:02.165
And I will. Of course, I will.

21:02.806 --> 21:06.023
I... b... I just said that
I would, didn't I?

21:06.661 --> 21:08.695
What?

21:08.696 --> 21:11.633
We should bury him at sea.

21:13.868 --> 21:14.868
- Hmm?
- Milo.

21:15.233 --> 21:19.233
You know, when we take
the money back, we'll...

21:20.086 --> 21:23.521
we'll take his body and on the way back

21:23.576 --> 21:27.576
to the marina, we... you know?

21:29.272 --> 21:31.652
We can't leave him in the freezer.

21:31.775 --> 21:35.110
Look, I-I-I need you to wire me some money.

21:35.135 --> 21:37.203
Just because I do.

21:37.907 --> 21:41.876
It's a business deal that, um,
Milo's bringing me in on.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.531
Bringing all of us in on.

21:43.694 --> 21:45.481
Why are you bringing that up?

21:45.778 --> 21:48.882
By definition, half of it is mine, too.

21:50.249 --> 21:53.383
Helena, we... can you
just do this for me, please?

21:54.253 --> 21:58.057
Because I'm fucking asking you to!

22:05.746 --> 22:07.348
Are they ready?

22:09.509 --> 22:11.172
Not yet.

22:22.556 --> 22:23.958
Oh.

22:26.460 --> 22:27.900
Here.

22:28.174 --> 22:32.174
I had her wire some extra
so we'd all have a few bucks.

22:36.248 --> 22:37.917
Thank you.

22:57.916 --> 23:00.017
Who in the hell buys mini Cokes?

23:00.018 --> 23:01.452
I'm not thirsty.

23:06.324 --> 23:07.892
Hey, I'm going as fast as I can, okay?

23:07.893 --> 23:09.293
No, I know, I know.

23:09.294 --> 23:10.717
I'm just... can I offer you a hand?

23:10.718 --> 23:12.460
Yeah, 20 minutes ago.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.976
You know, I don't buy all that stuff

23:19.977 --> 23:21.444
that Milo told you.

23:21.445 --> 23:24.046
And I realize I didn't
have a chance to say it

23:24.047 --> 23:26.183
at the time, but I'm sorry-

23:26.184 --> 23:28.651
for your marriage and the last job,

23:28.652 --> 23:30.421
things not working out for you.

23:30.748 --> 23:31.749
Thanks.

23:32.950 --> 23:34.452
But I think he was right.

23:38.164 --> 23:39.698
My life is a failure.

23:42.460 --> 23:45.162
Well, you still got your kids.

23:45.163 --> 23:46.563
Yeah.

23:46.564 --> 23:48.198
I mean, I know you don't see them much,

23:49.381 --> 23:51.033
but that's just a phase.

23:51.034 --> 23:52.869
They'll come around, you know?

23:52.870 --> 23:55.033
Hmm, yeah, maybe.

23:56.740 --> 24:00.740
You know, people say there
is no greater experience

24:00.778 --> 24:02.345
than having a kid,

24:02.346 --> 24:03.884
but-but when you have one,

24:04.744 --> 24:08.013
it's like-it's like consigning your-

24:08.014 --> 24:11.417
your relationship that you had
with your partner to-

24:11.418 --> 24:13.987
to history.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.805
Like, when-when a-when a man has a child,

24:16.806 --> 24:20.806
he-he creates his biggest rival, you know.

24:22.846 --> 24:26.716
A person who his wife loves more than him.

24:28.585 --> 24:31.119
I don't know.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.307
Well, everything happens
for a reason, right?

24:33.378 --> 24:35.104
I don't think it does.

24:36.816 --> 24:38.517
I think only morons believe that.

24:43.044 --> 24:44.089
It's ready.

24:49.962 --> 24:52.064
Other side.

24:54.299 --> 24:56.201
Ugh!

24:59.185 --> 25:01.354
Was that really necessary?

25:17.804 --> 25:20.607
You know Gus' wife's phone number, too?

25:31.159 --> 25:31.767
Oh, my God!

25:31.792 --> 25:32.792
- What, what?
- What?

25:33.676 --> 25:35.444
Something just ran across my feet.

25:35.789 --> 25:37.022
What?

25:37.023 --> 25:39.091
It was like a...
it was like a rat or something.

25:39.092 --> 25:42.227
Jesus Christ. Come on.

25:42.228 --> 25:43.729
Don't do that again.

25:43.730 --> 25:44.964
Whoa.

25:46.933 --> 25:48.568
Fuck.

26:22.549 --> 26:24.250
Okay, wait a minute.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.517
- Okay.
- Let me check right there.

26:25.518 --> 26:27.085
- Let me get right up there.
- Okay, ready?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.410
- Get going.
- Yeah, hold on.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.839
- You cool?
- Yeah, okay.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.862
- Ready?
- I got it.

26:30.863 --> 26:32.042
Don't push back.

26:32.043 --> 26:33.549
- Got it?
- I've got it.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.461
- Don't push back!
- Hold on, hold on!

26:35.462 --> 26:36.928
- No, we're not.
- We gotta get a better-

26:36.929 --> 26:37.483
we gotta get a better grip!

26:37.484 --> 26:38.803
- Ready?
- Okay, okay.

26:38.804 --> 26:40.433
Yeah.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.937
Fuck.

26:46.531 --> 26:47.781
Where did he go?

26:48.140 --> 26:49.257
Can you see him?

26:50.078 --> 26:51.644
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone.

26:51.669 --> 26:52.847
- No.
- Wait a minute.

26:53.090 --> 26:54.425
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Put this down.

26:54.426 --> 26:55.559
Put this down, put this down.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.441
Careful, careful.

26:56.442 --> 26:57.972
Shit.

26:57.997 --> 26:59.211
Hey, come on.

26:59.212 --> 27:00.212
What?

27:13.228 --> 27:17.228
Well, I guess that's his burial at sea.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.520
- Are they coming over here?
- What?

27:27.872 --> 27:28.738
Are they coming over here?

27:28.739 --> 27:31.208
Yep. They're coming here.

27:34.244 --> 27:35.614
Hey, there.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.795
Isn't this special?

27:37.796 --> 27:39.023
Oh, yeah.

27:39.024 --> 27:41.451
Proves you're alive, huh?

27:42.293 --> 27:44.560
Can you believe this full moon?

27:44.561 --> 27:46.362
You don't get this up in the States.

27:46.363 --> 27:48.731
Don't look at it.

27:48.732 --> 27:50.063
Don't fucking look at it.

27:50.064 --> 27:52.269
So where you guys from?

27:56.575 --> 27:58.211
Vancouver.

28:01.481 --> 28:03.886
- Great boat.
- Yeah, thanks.

28:03.887 --> 28:06.419
- Thank you.
- You, too.

28:13.693 --> 28:16.495
What do you say we don't
tell anybody about this?

28:16.496 --> 28:19.632
Well, folks come down here
and spoil it, huh?

28:23.833 --> 28:25.368
Well...

28:26.969 --> 28:28.771
see you around.

28:48.075 --> 28:49.809
- Let's get him out!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.043
- Let's get him out quick.
- We need a...

28:51.044 --> 28:52.412
I'll get a thing.

28:52.413 --> 28:54.481
Get the-the stick, the pole,

28:54.482 --> 28:56.349
- the pole with the...
- A gaff!

28:56.350 --> 28:57.584
- Get a gaff.
- A gaff, a gaff.

28:57.585 --> 29:00.354
Get a coat hanger or something.

29:19.713 --> 29:22.147
Look, even if we do find the right one,

29:22.148 --> 29:24.329
are you gonna be able to sail
this thing back in the dark?

29:24.330 --> 29:27.221
Yes. We're gonna do this.

29:29.052 --> 29:30.719
Clock is ticking. Let's go.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.230
One by one, until
we find the one that works.

29:33.231 --> 29:34.427
- All right.
- Okay.

29:39.825 --> 29:41.561
Nope.

29:45.029 --> 29:47.028
Yep, try it.

29:47.216 --> 29:49.299
Lex, try it!

29:49.300 --> 29:50.901
No good.

29:52.111 --> 29:53.681
Try that.

30:01.928 --> 30:03.028
- Go.
- Try it.

30:03.029 --> 30:04.298
Hit it, Lex!

30:06.445 --> 30:09.001
- Yeah!
- We did it!

30:09.002 --> 30:10.503
Yeah!

30:15.516 --> 30:16.950
- Yeah!
- All right!

30:16.951 --> 30:18.284
We just fixed a boat, man.

30:18.285 --> 30:19.522
Yes, we did.

30:19.547 --> 30:20.887
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:20.888 --> 30:22.045
Okay, it's-it's got to be

30:22.070 --> 30:23.763
just moving the throttle, right?

30:23.764 --> 30:25.958
Hey, are you sure you can navigate this?

30:25.959 --> 30:26.600
We don't even know where we're headed?

30:26.702 --> 30:27.974
Okay, positive thoughts, all right?

30:27.975 --> 30:29.411
We got to picture where we came from.

30:29.412 --> 30:33.412
We just got to head back that way, right?

30:33.609 --> 30:35.910
How do we raise anchor?

30:35.911 --> 30:38.330
Uh, try the button with the anchor on it.

30:38.331 --> 30:40.305
Try the button with the anchor on it.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.651
Smart.

30:42.652 --> 30:43.844
- There we go.
- See that?

30:43.845 --> 30:46.389
Every loser has his day, right?

30:55.740 --> 30:57.674
What did you say?

30:57.675 --> 31:00.076
I was-I was saying that
every loser has his day.

31:00.077 --> 31:01.612
Like, you know, the law of averages,

31:01.613 --> 31:03.594
we're bound to come up aces at some point.

31:03.595 --> 31:04.751
No, you weren't.

31:04.752 --> 31:07.033
No, you-you-you-you weren't saying we.

31:07.034 --> 31:09.484
There was no we. You were referring to me.

31:09.711 --> 31:11.044
No, I wasn't.

31:11.045 --> 31:14.281
Well, can we just start the boat, please?

31:14.282 --> 31:15.716
I know what you put in that letter.

31:15.717 --> 31:17.358
Still talking about the fucking letter.

31:17.359 --> 31:19.569
- What letter?
- Four years ago, my big break.

31:19.570 --> 31:22.122
All Mr. Big Shot here had to do was

31:22.123 --> 31:24.661
write a simple letter
of recommendation, you know.

31:24.662 --> 31:26.575
Say a few nice words on my behalf.

31:26.794 --> 31:28.262
I wrote your fucking letter.

31:28.372 --> 31:29.872
Oh, my God, I can't believe

31:29.873 --> 31:31.640
we're having this conversation now!

31:31.641 --> 31:34.443
I know what was in the fucking letter, Gus.

31:34.444 --> 31:38.281
Applicant is unreliable.

31:38.282 --> 31:39.882
He has a history of instability.

31:39.883 --> 31:41.750
You want me to keep going
'cause I can quote

31:41.751 --> 31:43.154
that motherfucker line for line.

31:43.155 --> 31:44.818
That letter was confidential

31:44.819 --> 31:46.155
for Mr. Mikey McFarlane's eyes only.

31:46.268 --> 31:47.134
Yeah, well, guess what.

31:47.135 --> 31:49.070
Mikey McFarlane was just in Grand Rapids

31:49.071 --> 31:53.009
and he told me how you
fucked me, college buddy.

31:59.516 --> 32:01.416
You have any idea what happened to me

32:01.417 --> 32:02.757
after I missed out on that?

32:03.385 --> 32:04.679
Huh?

32:05.523 --> 32:09.268
Yeah. I do.

32:09.542 --> 32:12.277
And it made me feel completely vindicated

32:12.278 --> 32:14.246
for what I wrote

32:14.247 --> 32:17.297
because you went back
to drinking and drugging

32:17.922 --> 32:19.957
for God knows how many years,
so I would say

32:19.958 --> 32:23.958
that unreliable is a pretty
accurate description.

32:24.529 --> 32:27.465
He was an important client who relied on me

32:27.466 --> 32:29.533
- for good advice.
- Great.

32:29.534 --> 32:31.001
Can we-can we-can we just go, please?

32:31.002 --> 32:31.899
- No, no, no, look...
- Guys, guys, come on.

32:31.900 --> 32:32.267
Listen.

32:32.291 --> 32:35.471
No, he thinks-he thinks that
I wanted to write that letter.

32:36.260 --> 32:37.712
You think that I enjoyed that.

32:37.713 --> 32:39.218
Did you think that when you were homeless

32:39.219 --> 32:42.734
and crashing on our couches
that I stopped for a second

32:42.735 --> 32:44.851
and thought to myself
that I might be responsible?

32:44.852 --> 32:48.800
I did what I had to do
for me and my client.

32:50.379 --> 32:53.349
And goddamn it, I still stand by it, Lex.

32:56.173 --> 32:57.883
I am sorry.

32:58.843 --> 33:01.713
I am really fucking sorry.

33:28.954 --> 33:32.190
Can I suggest

33:32.191 --> 33:33.992
for now

33:33.993 --> 33:36.390
you accept his apology

33:37.597 --> 33:41.597
and we can at least try to

33:41.801 --> 33:45.770
make this deadline that is now just-just-

33:45.771 --> 33:48.741
just one hour away from running out?

33:54.167 --> 33:55.702
Cobi, check the front.

33:55.703 --> 33:57.207
Make sure I'm not gonna hit anything.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.356
Yeah.

34:01.505 --> 34:04.541
- Are we good?
- Yeah, go for it.

34:14.373 --> 34:15.804
We're going backwards!

34:16.856 --> 34:18.456
Sh...

34:22.027 --> 34:23.862
It's stuck in the mud.

34:34.085 --> 34:36.219
Um...

34:36.219 --> 34:38.909
this is just my opinion,

34:39.723 --> 34:41.067
but...

34:42.458 --> 34:45.596
I don't think we're gonna
make the deadline now.

34:47.731 --> 34:48.904
Right.

34:50.467 --> 34:53.835
Again, just my opinion,

34:53.837 --> 34:57.837
but I don't think we should
hang out here very long.

35:00.549 --> 35:01.736
He's right.

35:04.750 --> 35:08.750
Maybe when-when we hand the money back...

35:09.222 --> 35:11.962
we can describe where the boat is,

35:12.650 --> 35:15.151
then JesÃºs will-will cut us some slack

35:15.152 --> 35:19.022
on account of not really

35:19.023 --> 35:22.010
being boat people.

35:22.471 --> 35:24.229
Well, what about Milo?

35:25.363 --> 35:27.494
I say we just, uh,

35:29.281 --> 35:30.979
put him back in the water.

35:32.648 --> 35:36.551
Okay. Really consider this

35:36.552 --> 35:39.021
before you react.

35:42.038 --> 35:45.241
We cut off Milo's hands and
we leave him on the boat.

35:48.277 --> 35:51.579
Look, JesÃºs cuts of hands and feet, right?

35:51.580 --> 35:54.082
Milo's already lost his feet

35:54.083 --> 35:55.583
so we just leave him on the boat

35:55.584 --> 35:57.619
and then it'll look
like a drug deal gone bad.

35:57.620 --> 36:00.080
Then, if somebody finds him,
they won't be looking for us

36:00.081 --> 36:02.458
and that might buy us some time.

36:06.723 --> 36:09.625
That's... actually...

36:09.626 --> 36:11.727
a smart idea.

36:16.071 --> 36:17.806
All right.

36:23.512 --> 36:25.414
This is all I could find.

36:31.228 --> 36:32.897
I did the feet.

36:34.398 --> 36:36.833
This is wrong.

36:36.834 --> 36:38.534
This... I get with the feet.

36:38.535 --> 36:40.270
She was coming up the drive.

36:40.271 --> 36:42.091
It was an impulsive thing, but this is-

36:42.216 --> 36:45.676
this is premeditated butchery.

36:45.677 --> 36:48.112
This is my friend.

37:58.650 --> 38:00.126
I can't.

38:00.919 --> 38:02.770
- Just do it.
- I can't do it 'cause-

38:03.294 --> 38:06.925
because his-his watch is in the way.

38:13.077 --> 38:14.077
There.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.730
- Jackpot Casino.
- How much?

38:53.731 --> 38:55.299
One.

39:02.773 --> 39:05.175
- Winner.
- Nice one, eh?

39:05.176 --> 39:08.645
- How much you win?
- Two dollar.

39:08.646 --> 39:11.950
This day your lucky day.

39:15.692 --> 39:18.105
Put it in the collection box.

39:19.095 --> 39:21.431
You done good, man.

39:34.845 --> 39:38.347
Hey, maybe I should have the gun now.

39:38.348 --> 39:38.970
Why?

39:38.971 --> 39:40.876
Well, because you had it last time.

39:40.877 --> 39:42.111
Joel!

39:42.448 --> 39:44.049
You're gonna go in first.

39:44.050 --> 39:45.283
We're gonna come in tight behind you

39:45.284 --> 39:47.419
zero-dark-30 style, all right?

39:47.420 --> 39:48.486
Right.

39:48.487 --> 39:52.068
So you mean, like, using me as a shield?

39:52.239 --> 39:53.504
You wanted the gun.

39:53.505 --> 39:56.514
As soon as you see him, you
train the gun on him, okay?

39:56.515 --> 40:00.333
And keep it on him and then
we'll hand over the money.

40:35.059 --> 40:37.589
You were involved
in a car accident yesterday.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.537
Me? You have the wrong information.

40:41.098 --> 40:42.572
Please.

40:42.573 --> 40:45.875
We will find your car
and it will be damaged.

40:45.876 --> 40:48.178
A little respect.

40:52.571 --> 40:55.374
The accident was with four American men.

40:56.052 --> 40:57.986
These men, have you seen them since?

40:58.104 --> 40:59.137
No.

40:59.326 --> 41:01.421
Did they give you some 500 euro notes

41:01.495 --> 41:05.197
- to pay for the damage?
- No.

41:05.433 --> 41:07.932
Do you know who uses 500 euro notes?

41:08.306 --> 41:11.370
Drug dealers, people like JesÃºs.

41:11.542 --> 41:12.690
Maybe this is his money.

41:12.839 --> 41:15.207
Do you think it is wise
to be spending his money?

41:15.208 --> 41:17.309
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:17.310 --> 41:19.712
You, or...

41:19.713 --> 41:22.114
somebody from your family,

41:22.115 --> 41:25.362
has been exchanging 500 euro notes in town.

41:26.409 --> 41:27.885
You're not in trouble.

41:28.627 --> 41:30.346
All I need to know is,

41:31.299 --> 41:34.857
did you get these notes from the Americans?

42:09.790 --> 42:11.203
No police boat.

42:12.025 --> 42:13.926
Look, man, I'm not trying to be funny here,

42:13.927 --> 42:16.195
but do we really believe that guy is a cop?

42:16.196 --> 42:18.179
- Why?
- Because he's four foot tall.

42:18.598 --> 42:20.154
Don't they have some kind
of height requirement?

42:20.155 --> 42:22.544
He said, "We are the police."

42:22.545 --> 42:23.795
Yeah, but just because he
said he's a cop doesn't mean...

42:23.796 --> 42:25.196
Are we sure it was a police boat?

42:25.358 --> 42:27.326
It had blue lights.

42:27.327 --> 42:30.529
- Police decals?
- Yeah, yeah, I think.

42:30.530 --> 42:33.232
'Cause it-it-it's just
she said she's a cop.

42:33.233 --> 42:35.511
Yeah, but I never seen a cop
behave the way that she does.

42:35.512 --> 42:38.715
Look, I think he's a cop and she's a cop.

42:38.716 --> 42:41.329
I'm telling you, that
guy is not a cop, okay?

42:41.330 --> 42:43.594
What kind of country has
a munchkin-size police force?

42:43.595 --> 42:45.430
So what are you saying?
That neither of them is a cop?

42:45.720 --> 42:46.805
No, they're both cops.

42:46.806 --> 42:48.663
Hey, look, I think
they're working together.

42:48.664 --> 42:50.047
I don't think they're working together.

42:50.048 --> 42:51.368
They both want the boat, right?

42:51.742 --> 42:53.543
Yeah, they both want the boat,

42:53.544 --> 42:55.311
but for-but for different reasons, I think.

42:55.312 --> 42:56.176
Whatever the reason, we can't afford

42:56.177 --> 42:58.114
to give this money to the wrong people.

42:58.177 --> 43:00.209
- Right.
- All right.

43:00.210 --> 43:04.210
Well, he's not here, all right, so...

44:17.676 --> 44:20.077
We got to be careful not to get dehydrated.

44:27.607 --> 44:29.109
Thanks, man.

44:33.777 --> 44:35.645
Yeah, 'cause we wouldn't want something bad

44:35.646 --> 44:37.280
to happen to us on this trip, right?

44:41.417 --> 44:42.517
Oh, fuck.

44:46.824 --> 44:49.793
Touch it and I blow his face off!

44:51.355 --> 44:53.346
Move away from the table.

44:54.642 --> 44:56.042
- He can't breathe!
- You're choking him!

44:56.043 --> 44:57.478
I told you to bring us the boat.

44:57.479 --> 44:58.945
It's in the lagoon.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.481
- We will show where it is.
- It got stuck.

45:00.482 --> 45:01.648
Sir, we tried to bring it back!

45:01.649 --> 45:03.584
Will you please let that man breathe!

45:05.286 --> 45:07.220
We have your money. Okay?

45:07.221 --> 45:10.657
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right here.

45:10.658 --> 45:12.283
Here. Here.

45:34.087 --> 45:35.523
Go that way!

45:43.784 --> 45:44.736
That way.

45:44.737 --> 45:46.754
Hey! Hey!

45:49.711 --> 45:53.711
- Hold up!
- Hey!

45:54.015 --> 45:55.884
In here!

45:57.919 --> 46:01.919
Hey, hey! Hey, hey. Hey.

46:06.862 --> 46:07.974
Wait.

46:17.162 --> 46:19.974
We-we know you're in there.

46:20.036 --> 46:22.773
So-so come out with your hands up.

46:23.804 --> 46:26.306
Fuck off.

46:26.307 --> 46:29.008
Man, give me this.

46:29.009 --> 46:30.112
Listen to me.

46:30.137 --> 46:32.446
I'm giving you three seconds
to come out of there

46:32.447 --> 46:34.931
or I am going to light this
motherfucking closet up,

46:34.932 --> 46:36.339
you hear me?

46:37.205 --> 46:40.241
Three, two...

46:44.179 --> 46:45.779
One!

46:45.780 --> 46:47.981
Do it, do it.

46:47.982 --> 46:49.817
I can't. I can't.

46:52.287 --> 46:56.006
Hey, buddy, look,
we don't want to hurt you.

46:56.115 --> 46:58.363
- I do!
- I'm going to fuck you up!

46:58.364 --> 47:00.771
- Who do you work for?
- Do you work for JesÃºs?

47:00.772 --> 47:01.772
Who sent you?

47:02.341 --> 47:04.665
Suck my cock!

47:05.503 --> 47:07.041
This isn't really working.

47:07.042 --> 47:09.139
Screw this.

47:15.336 --> 47:16.903
No, get him off. Hold him!

47:16.904 --> 47:18.104
Hold him! Get him off!

47:22.277 --> 47:24.275
Let me shoot him! Let me kill him.

47:24.276 --> 47:26.446
- I got him.
- Nobody's killing anybody!

47:27.002 --> 47:28.415
Let's deep fry this little motherfucker.

47:28.416 --> 47:30.350
Hey, let's waterboard him!

47:30.351 --> 47:32.552
- What?
- No, no! We need him!

47:32.553 --> 47:34.654
Okay. Let's take him downstairs.

47:34.655 --> 47:36.723
- Yeah.
- Yeah, pick him up.

47:36.724 --> 47:39.480
Yeah! Fucker.

47:40.137 --> 47:41.404
Let's drop him on his head.

47:41.483 --> 47:43.417
- No, we need him.
- Ah!

47:43.731 --> 47:45.274
We have him and we have the money.

47:45.275 --> 47:46.704
- Okay.
- So we got leverage.

47:46.705 --> 47:49.330
I still think we should
we should torture him a bit.

47:49.331 --> 47:50.384
Why do you keep saying that?

47:50.385 --> 47:52.305
So he knows we mean business.

47:52.618 --> 47:53.918
Grab a chair.

47:55.887 --> 47:58.432
Simmer down! Hey!

47:58.433 --> 48:01.792
Sit! Knock it off!

48:01.793 --> 48:03.328
Give me his legs!

48:03.329 --> 48:05.296
Get some rope or tape or something.

48:05.297 --> 48:06.497
All right, all right, all right.

48:06.498 --> 48:09.500
Aah, little fucker just bit me!

48:09.501 --> 48:10.935
Bite him back!

48:10.936 --> 48:12.237
I can't find anything!

48:12.238 --> 48:14.772
- Get-get twine!
- Wait, how about this?

48:14.773 --> 48:16.741
Yeah, yeah.

48:18.944 --> 48:20.612
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

48:22.948 --> 48:24.182
Yeah.

48:24.183 --> 48:25.616
All right.

48:25.617 --> 48:27.385
He's too strong, he's too strong.

48:27.386 --> 48:29.514
Yeah!

48:29.515 --> 48:32.269
Goddamn it!

48:32.375 --> 48:34.309
He's kicking me in the balls!

48:34.310 --> 48:35.748
He kicking me in my balls!

48:35.749 --> 48:38.714
Yeah, bite now, bitch!

48:40.516 --> 48:42.567
- All right!
- Wait, wait, we gotta...

48:42.592 --> 48:44.155
we gotta lock him up someplace secure

48:44.156 --> 48:45.053
while we go to the embassy.

48:45.054 --> 48:47.030
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:47.157 --> 48:48.905
The well! We put him in the well.

48:48.945 --> 48:50.446
- Good idea!
- Yeah.

48:50.447 --> 48:51.813
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

48:51.814 --> 48:53.915
I don't think that might be the best place.

48:53.916 --> 48:57.916
- No, the well!
- Well, well, well, well, well!

48:58.525 --> 49:00.327
All right, bring it over here.

49:02.763 --> 49:04.698
Close your mouth.

49:10.583 --> 49:13.518
- All right, get over here.
- Yeah! Hold on.

49:13.519 --> 49:17.519
Yeah! Hoist him up! Yeah!

49:20.232 --> 49:22.267
I got it. Let go.

49:38.143 --> 49:40.517
Huh, yeah? How do you like that, huh?

49:40.557 --> 49:42.579

You like that? Nipple rubbing bastard!

49:54.633 --> 49:57.068

Tighter, tighter. Come on.
