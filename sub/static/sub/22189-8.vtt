WEBVTT

00:13.440 --> 00:14.280
Right!

00:19.840 --> 00:21.080
Go around the back way.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.320
Fuck!

01:23.520 --> 01:25.280
Shut up and don't move, piece of shit!

01:26.200 --> 01:28.240
-What do you want?
-Shut up, asshole!

01:28.320 --> 01:30.480
-I didn't do fuckin' nothing.
-Shut up!

01:54.160 --> 01:57.800
THE DAY BEFORE

01:59.040 --> 02:01.520
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:10.320 --> 02:12.640
Sara, sorry to call at this hour.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.520
Can you drop by in the morning?

02:18.520 --> 02:21.240
I need to speak to you
about something very important.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.320
Good, see you tomorrow.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.600
How the fuck did we lose
in the Vatican Commission?

03:00.920 --> 03:03.600
We've lost, it's true,
but I've already fixed it.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.640
You didn't need to bother coming,
I would have called you.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.240
What a fucking city, huh?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.360
It never stops.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.640
It must be exhausting.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.840
I couldn't live anywhere else.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.160
Are you hurt? Is everything okay?

04:35.240 --> 04:36.960
Go away, I'm fine.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.600
How do you feel?

05:17.680 --> 05:20.480
Like someone who took a bullet
for someone else.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.800
I didn't ask you to go there in my place.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.560
Between husband and wife,
that's what you do.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.720
The bullet just grazed me, but it hurts.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.600
I'm not your sister.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.200
That's the second time
I've covered for you,

05:51.280 --> 05:53.520
and I don't even know
where the fuck you were.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.560
I'm over it!

05:55.640 --> 05:56.680
Listen, Angelica...

05:57.920 --> 05:59.200
What?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.240
Let's go to bed.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.400
I've done some shit in my time,

06:15.480 --> 06:17.880
but something this stupid,
I'd never have imagined.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.760
Good thing nothing happened.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.120
But it could have. That's the problem,

06:23.200 --> 06:25.040
and it was about to happen to me.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.640
-So, have you decided?
-About what?

06:30.080 --> 06:33.080
To take sleeping pills,
rest, actually sleep.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.000
Gotta go.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.280
The gypsies and Adamis will be
at the stables soon.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.760
Well? Got nothing to say for yourself?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.640
In the end, nothing happened.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.240
She nearly dies,
and you say nothing happened?

07:18.840 --> 07:19.880
All right...

07:19.960 --> 07:22.480
Where do you think you're going?
You're coming with me.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.240
With you, once a kid, always a kid.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.480
From now on, you gotta ask permission
even to take a piss.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.440
-Amedeo, get rid of those shoes.
-Why?

07:40.520 --> 07:42.760
You need at least another pair for work.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.640
You know I'm attached to them.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.760
You can get attached
to new shoes too, you know?

07:49.640 --> 07:52.240
-You think?
-Go shopping, you might change your mind.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.080
What is it?

08:13.920 --> 08:15.280
I like that you're here,

08:16.120 --> 08:17.440
walking around the house.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.080
I've never seen such a big house.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.360
Later, we'll get your stuff
so we can fill it up, okay?

08:35.360 --> 08:36.360
I'm coming with you.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.440
Don't worry, Romolo's there.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.640
Yeah, but I'm not like your brother,
I won't leave you alone.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.080
I'm not alone, I already told you,
I've got Romolo with me.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.960
Relax.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.520
Really.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.120
You stay here and keep watch
with the others.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.520
You've both made mistakes,
but they're the Adamis.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.760
You call my father's death a mistake?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.920
Call it what you want, but it wasn't us.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.040
No, it was me...

09:41.120 --> 09:42.320
It's your problem.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.920
I don't sit down with gypsies.

09:46.000 --> 09:46.960
Wait.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.200
Your men fucked up at the Eur Café.
You overstepped.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.960
So now, you'll compensate Livia

09:55.040 --> 09:58.000
and fuck off back
to your ugly little villas.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.240
How was I supposed to know the Adamis
controlled the cafés in Eur, too?

10:01.320 --> 10:02.400
Now you do.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.960
She's already got all of Ostia.
Why does she need to expand to Eur?

10:07.720 --> 10:10.800
-And fuck all for us?
-Your clan doesn't count for shit.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.360
They're the Adamis!

10:17.960 --> 10:21.400
Rumor has it your brother doesn't
give a fuck about Ostia anymore.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.720
And you can't make it on your own.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.040
Don't you even mention Ostia.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.960
Manfredi, we're through.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.840
You're taken care of. I'm not.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.000
I'm still waiting for the signatures
for the land you promised me.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.560
Fuck all, then?

10:53.960 --> 10:56.160
Fuck all, what?
Do you ever use your brain?

10:56.240 --> 10:59.240
I could use it,
but we've still got fuck all.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.240
It's already a win being invited here,

11:02.320 --> 11:04.320
we've never sat down at this level before.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.040
Let's go.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.240
-What are you doing here?
-Shopping.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.120
Liar, you hate shopping.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.560
Look how you get around.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.160
See, you were wrong the last time?

12:09.720 --> 12:12.640
You said we've got nothing in common
and yet, here we are...

12:13.400 --> 12:16.440
talking about my shoes
like in the good old days.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.520
Darling, the good old days are history
and so are you.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.080
Did I let you down, Gabriella?

12:22.760 --> 12:23.960
Let go of me, please!

12:24.760 --> 12:28.040
You thought I'd stay quietly in my place
as usual...

12:28.440 --> 12:29.720
instead, I let you down.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.360
Things have changed, Sara.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.600
And you have to give the Ostia land
to Samurai.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.800
Is this a joke?

12:53.720 --> 12:55.880
Your husband renounces the purchase,

12:55.960 --> 12:59.360
and the land automatically sells
to Samurai's company.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.560
The contract just needs to be signed.
I don't understand...

13:02.840 --> 13:04.720
What's there to understand?

13:04.800 --> 13:09.000
Or do you really think I'd have invited
a loser like Sandro to my home?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.840
To go against Samurai,
I needed to trade you.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.200
I created an obstacle for him,
then I removed it.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.120
He gets the land,
and I get back my husband's empire.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.640
And here we are.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.000
-I'm not giving up that land.
-Do it.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.560
Or I'll report you for Theodosiou.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.240
You've got no proof.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.280
I have my ways.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.720
Someone starts talking about
the suspicious death of the monsignor,

13:35.800 --> 13:39.160
rumors travel,
an investigation is opened,

13:39.240 --> 13:41.800
the autopsy is questioned,

13:41.880 --> 13:44.640
the medical examiner caves and tells all.

13:45.640 --> 13:49.320
You, Sara,
forced him to cover up the suicide.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.600
You'll understand me in time.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.560
I've got to go. The poor await.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.280
How did it go?

14:29.240 --> 14:31.080
Bad, but good, it seems.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.400
Alberto, what were you going
to tell me last night?

14:42.520 --> 14:44.160
Give me back my phone.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.360
When I say something, you do it!

14:55.280 --> 14:59.200
You were going to say you've got a lover!
That's why you don't make love to me.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.320
You, Monaschi
and those other two shitbags

15:32.400 --> 15:34.120
together went up against me.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.440
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

15:40.560 --> 15:41.880
Listen,

15:42.480 --> 15:45.200
you put them in my way,
now you gotta take them out.

15:45.720 --> 15:46.840
Now.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.640
Can I explain?

15:49.720 --> 15:53.120
Explain what happened
to that fake little smile you had before?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.480
Where'd you put it?

15:55.040 --> 15:57.480
Now you gotta get your little pals
outta the way.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.640
How?

16:04.160 --> 16:05.680
Set a trap for them.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.880
Tell them to meet you at midnight
in the parking lot of Piazza Mancini,

16:09.960 --> 16:11.160
and we'll show up instead.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.520
Or else I'll tell what you did
to Tullio Adami,

16:13.600 --> 16:15.800
first to your dad and then to Aureliano.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.440
And me...

16:22.000 --> 16:23.240
what happens to me?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.840
A cop's son always comes in handy.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.360
-Have you heard from Lele?
-No.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.520
And where the fuck's Monaschi?
How long till it's signed?

17:37.720 --> 17:40.040
The fuck do I know? It'll take a while.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.400
Is that why you called me?

17:43.440 --> 17:46.800
No, I called 'cause today
our families met with Samurai.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.560
They made a deal,
but I don't think it will last long.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.320
-That's their problem.
-I wish.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.320
Yesterday, my wife
almost got killed at the Eur Café.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.240
The fuck was she doing there?

18:02.240 --> 18:05.160
Nothing. Supposed to make a delivery
and she went instead.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.680
What happened to her?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.280
Nothing, luckily.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.360
That's good.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.880
Bro, I gotta go,
I gotta move Isabel's stuff in.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.400
Take it easy, okay?

18:27.960 --> 18:29.320
Is she moving in with you?

18:30.440 --> 18:32.120
I gotta give it a try, too, right?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.760
It looks better on you than me.
Keep it.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.880
Go to your wife, she needs you.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.840
You oughta be happy.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.000
You're right,

19:19.040 --> 19:20.920
but Aureliano has not signed yet,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.600
and Samurai wants the land
I promised him, now.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.000
You need to talk to your brother.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.400
If he answers his cell.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.200
-Who knows what he's doing.
-Living his own life.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.240
He should be here, with this family.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.480
Yeah, but at a certain point,
you grow up and make another family.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.480
What are you talking about?

19:46.960 --> 19:49.880
Nothing. He's been seen around Ostia
with a black girl.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.520
-I don't believe it.
-It's true. It's normal.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.720
It's better for him,
for everyone, come on.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.240
A fucking black girl?

20:00.640 --> 20:01.560
Yeah.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.200
He's just like my father.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.280
They've even moved in together.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.000
Where are they staying?

20:21.080 --> 20:22.160
Come on...

20:22.240 --> 20:24.080
Tell me where the fuck they're staying.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.360
At your mother's house.

21:25.680 --> 21:26.680
Dad?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.760
Dad, you've got to help me.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.800
Listen, I'm about to go on duty.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.240
I'll tell you everything,

21:40.280 --> 21:41.520
no lies.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.240
You'll lie.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.040
No, not this time.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.600
I hope so. I don't want to have to
kick you out of here, too.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.000
It's all bullshit, small-time stuff.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.000
Really?

22:08.280 --> 22:10.480
And Samurai's small time too?

22:15.400 --> 22:19.800
They asked me to take part
in a coke deal tonight, 50 grams.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.000
These two guys are bringing it to me.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.080
Listen, snorting a few lines at a party
is one thing,

22:30.040 --> 22:33.000
but I've never dealt in my life,
and I don't want to start now.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.720
-I want to get my life back.
-Enough, I heard you.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.040
Listen to me,

22:42.080 --> 22:45.400
I'm not going to ask you
any more questions, you confirm.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.280
Act calm and say you'll go.
Then you stay at home.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.280
-We'll go in your place.
-And what will happen?

22:52.360 --> 22:55.880
What will happen is we'll arrest
the little assholes red-handed.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.320
Assholes, I told you,
they're two kids like me.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.440
Two kids with fifty grams of coke?

23:09.840 --> 23:11.880
But promise me you won't go.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.320
Thank you.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.280
When? Where? Describe them.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.560
At ten.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.520
Outside the church on the Tiber Island.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.840
One's tall and blonde,
and the other one's got a mohawk.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.120
Listen to me,

23:38.280 --> 23:40.080
I'll deal with this now,

23:41.680 --> 23:44.360
but then you've got to tell me everything,

23:44.440 --> 23:46.800
from Samurai to these drug deals.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.640
Everything's gonna be all right, Gabriele.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.440
Everything.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.720
So? Tell me what you got in the end.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.960
All I know is we nearly made it.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.800
You went into business with the worst
criminals in Rome, you lost your mind,

24:14.880 --> 24:16.840
you lost everything we had.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.240
Maybe there's still a way.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.080
I don't think so.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.520
I've got to go back to work.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.520
I have to try.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.040
Give me a hand.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.720
You were brave yesterday.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.400
This fuckin' tie's strangling me.
It's driving me nuts.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.520
I'll clean it up.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.800
Don't get confused...

25:24.120 --> 25:25.680
your husband is someone else.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.560
It's your son who needs
to remember he's got a wife!

25:29.280 --> 25:31.920
My son doesn't have any problems
with his memory.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.680
But I think he's got another problem,
a nice big one, right?

25:37.040 --> 25:39.600
And you're here to solve it.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.280
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.440
Be a wife, nothing else.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.720
But if my husband doesn't want me,
what am I doing here?

25:57.440 --> 26:01.040
If you leave him now,
my son's life is at risk,

26:01.120 --> 26:03.160
and you risk counting for nothing.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.880
[in Sinti]
[We women reason with our bellies.]

26:11.360 --> 26:14.600
[And we always find a way
to save a marriage.]

26:43.720 --> 26:46.160
-Who are you?
-My name's Sara Monaschi.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.280
I need to talk to you.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.960
I'm under house arrest.
I'm not allowed to let anyone in.

26:50.040 --> 26:53.320
You and I have something in common:
Samurai.

26:54.320 --> 26:58.040
-He used both of us.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.400
I work at the Vatican,
and I can make things hard for him,

27:01.480 --> 27:04.040
but I need something
I can use against him.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.560
I can protect you.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.720
Got any idea who's behind him
on the zoning plan deal?

27:09.120 --> 27:12.480
If I'm still alive,
it's only because I've never talked.

27:12.560 --> 27:16.560
You don't need to.
Give me something. I'll be the face.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.120
The face?
They'll shoot us both in the face.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.280
How long would it take the Mafia
to figure out I fucked them over?

27:23.880 --> 27:24.800
The Mafia?

27:26.360 --> 27:29.280
-Then, give me proof.
-Find it yourself.

27:29.360 --> 27:33.160
But hurry, and maybe
there's still hope for both of us.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.400
Yo, bro.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.560
What's up?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.240
-All good?
-Yeah, you?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.160
-Where are we with Monaschi?
-That's why I called you.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.760
Sara's organized a party
for the deal being sealed,

28:18.640 --> 28:20.000
we need a lot of blow.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.440
No problem, we'll take care of it.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.000
And where will we hook up?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.400
At ten on the Tiber Island.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.240
The Tiber Island at ten.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.320
All right.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.680
-Done.
-Where the fuck you going?

28:34.760 --> 28:37.120
-We gotta make a toast.
-We gotta celebrate.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.360
Here's to us!

28:47.120 --> 28:50.040
I got a lot of shit to do
so give me the blow now.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.400
Come on, finish that beer later.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.280
-See you, Lele.
-See ya, bro.

29:13.080 --> 29:17.280
City Hall...
I imagined it more majestic.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.840
Well, it is, just not this office.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.320
-Is this your first time here?
-No, but I always think the same thing.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.760
Have you got kids?

29:30.480 --> 29:32.720
Yes, you?

29:33.080 --> 29:34.960
No. Unfortunately not.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.800
Anyway, I wouldn't have been
a good mother.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.760
It takes courage to admit that.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.840
It took some for me
to come to see you today, too.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.160
What can I do for you?

29:53.000 --> 29:56.920
One of the companies interested
in the Ostia land is dirty,

29:57.640 --> 30:01.160
and if you look into it,
you'll even find the Mafia.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.080
The Mafia? In Rome?

30:06.160 --> 30:09.640
Make public the scandal
before it's too late.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.160
You're making a very serious accusation,
how do you know this?

30:15.640 --> 30:17.840
Look into that company.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.520
It's all in there, but do it now.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.000
Thank you for coming to me.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.240
Can I trust you?

30:28.840 --> 30:30.280
You just did.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.040
Yes?

31:12.120 --> 31:13.200
Aureliano?

31:13.280 --> 31:14.440
He's gone out.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.280
You must be the cleaning woman, right?

31:23.760 --> 31:25.800
No, actually, I live here.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.240
Who are you?

31:27.320 --> 31:29.520
No, the question is: who are you?

31:29.600 --> 31:31.400
And above all, what are you doing here?

31:31.480 --> 31:33.400
Sweetie, go away.
I'm already sick of you.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.040
Get your hand off me.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.800
I'll tell you what you are,

31:41.560 --> 31:42.840
a hooker.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.640
A black one.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.640
So, now gather up
all your nice African crap

31:48.720 --> 31:51.440
and get out of here,
because this is my house.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.480
I know who you are,

31:55.400 --> 31:57.080
you're Aureliano's sister.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.480
Livia and that's all.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.200
And I'm his woman.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.440
Is that what he said?

32:03.520 --> 32:05.440
What else did he tell you
to get you here?

32:05.520 --> 32:07.520
That he wants to live here with me.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.320
My father had a thing
for black girls, too.

32:12.920 --> 32:15.200
He'd make them believe
who knows what,

32:15.280 --> 32:17.240
tell them he loved them.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.080
He'd find apartments for them,

32:19.560 --> 32:21.400
but they were still hookers.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.680
If he didn't pay them, he didn't like it.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.960
You're wrong,
because your brother doesn't pay me.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.280
He's clearly smarter than his father.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.640
He's fucking you for free.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.280
Can I ask what you're up to?

32:58.160 --> 32:59.480
Doing a favor for a friend.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.240
He's got a big appetite, this friend...

33:07.880 --> 33:08.880
How's my sister?

33:10.240 --> 33:12.440
Still running errands for Samurai?

33:12.520 --> 33:16.320
Only you can take care of that
piece of shit, it's no job for a woman.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.960
Come home, Aureliano.

33:19.320 --> 33:20.880
Make up with your sister.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.120
There's a void there
that makes me feel bad.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.800
You're a good guy, Romolo.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.200
The problem is they're not all like you.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.520
-Now I know what you wanted to tell me.
-Again?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.360
No, now I'll finish.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.159
I know what you are.

34:19.040 --> 34:19.960
What am I?

34:20.920 --> 34:24.239
You don't like girls.
That's why you don't touch me.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.280
I saw you today with your little pal,

34:27.360 --> 34:30.120
and I suddenly understood everything,
including our wedding night.

34:30.760 --> 34:31.960
What did you see?

34:37.679 --> 34:39.239
You like him a lot, huh?

34:41.719 --> 34:45.159
I saw how you looked at him,
you were eating him up with your eyes.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.239
What the fuck are you talking about?

34:59.240 --> 35:01.680
If I tell Manfredi, you're dead,

35:02.120 --> 35:04.920
but I'm prepared to go on
like a real couple.

35:05.960 --> 35:07.400
What do you mean?

35:10.880 --> 35:13.960
I married you to become the princess
of this family,

35:14.400 --> 35:16.520
and instead, I'm like a servant.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.840
I want a baby,

35:19.440 --> 35:22.360
a prince without an heir
doesn't count for shit.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.960
And me, without an heir, I'm leaving.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.360
What do you want to do?

36:09.520 --> 36:10.680
What are you doing here?

36:11.760 --> 36:14.120
Sara Monaschi came to see me today.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
She says someone brought the Mafia
to Rome.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.240
And that I should make a scandal.

36:19.840 --> 36:20.960
She's crazy.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.320
Seems dangerous, though.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.640
That depends on what she knows...
What does she know?

36:29.480 --> 36:30.960
Someone talked to her,

36:32.400 --> 36:33.440
maybe Finucci.

36:36.840 --> 36:37.960
Could be.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.680
-Where's the stuff?
-It's here.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.840
What's with you?

37:04.440 --> 37:08.040
Spadino, what the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

37:08.120 --> 37:10.160
Leave me alone, it's personal shit.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.760
Look at me,
leave your personal shit out of here!

37:13.800 --> 37:16.040
We're about to make it big, all right?

37:19.120 --> 37:20.280
And gimme a smile.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.560
Look what a cool hat you got!
You should be happy...

37:23.640 --> 37:24.960
Gimme this thing.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.520
Let's go.

37:56.160 --> 37:59.440
I'm glad you came,
but I can't let you in.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.240
-That how you treat a friend?
-The cops will be here any minute.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.320
They check on visitors.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.440
You could have come to me, then.

38:12.520 --> 38:16.120
Let's say... that's not an option.

38:17.480 --> 38:21.000
I would have come before,
but I'm getting old, Giacomo.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.760
Yeah, but we're aging well, come on.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.800
I know how to get you out
of this situation.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.200
But...

38:30.960 --> 38:33.360
you have to go as far away as possible.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.160
You want a drink?

38:42.880 --> 38:44.360
I quit a while back.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.120
No...

38:46.560 --> 38:48.320
that's not how you age well.

38:49.720 --> 38:50.840
Leave it.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.120
Remember when we used
to drink seven beers each...

38:54.680 --> 38:58.040
and then go and beat up communists?
We sure let 'em have it.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.000
They sure let us have it.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.280
Good times.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.640
Good times.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.280
So, tell me,

39:13.760 --> 39:16.200
how far do I have to go,

39:16.680 --> 39:17.920
do you think?

39:30.680 --> 39:33.320
Far away, Giacomo, far!

40:05.880 --> 40:07.600
Where the fuck is he?

40:07.680 --> 40:09.280
He said he'd be here at ten.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.480
Nice.

41:38.560 --> 41:39.960
Were they expensive?

41:42.560 --> 41:43.800
You like them?

41:45.880 --> 41:47.000
Try them on.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.480
You look like a different person...

42:22.240 --> 42:23.480
A different person.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.520
I've fucking had it with this.

43:08.800 --> 43:09.960
Stop!

43:15.360 --> 43:16.440
There!

43:27.240 --> 43:28.280
Go!

44:58.120 --> 45:00.400
-Shut up and don't move!
-What do you want?

45:00.480 --> 45:03.160
-Shut up, asshole!
-I didn't do fucking nothing.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.240
Shut up!

45:58.440 --> 46:00.240
