01:50.710 --> 01:55.210
A NEW FRIEND

02:01.217 --> 02:05.417
Laura was my best friend,
my friend forever.

02:06.519 --> 02:10.119
Since we met
it was like a crush.

02:11.221 --> 02:14.821
Because she was and I was.

02:16.023 --> 02:17.823
We had seven years ...

02:18.324 --> 02:21.924
and it sure would be for
life to death.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.835
I present to your
new partner,

02:33.936 --> 02:35.136
Laura.

02:37.339 --> 02:40.339
Well, we were in
the grammar lesson,

02:40.840 --> 02:42.940
with verbs of the first group.

02:43.241 --> 02:46.241
Who can give me examples
verbs of the first group?

03:28.484 --> 03:30.884
All life to death.

03:31.285 --> 03:33.685
All life to death.

03:33.886 --> 03:36.286
All life to death.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.029
All they look.

04:26.036 --> 04:27.536
Hi Laura.
Are you okay?

05:00.570 --> 05:01.770
What's up?

06:07.436 --> 06:10.136
May the Lord confirm
this decision ...

06:10.337 --> 06:15.537
and give them his Spirit to
I serve as a common agreement,

06:15.838 --> 06:21.338
and that your union be blessed
in the name of the Father and of the Son ...

06:21.439 --> 06:23.539
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

06:25.241 --> 06:27.041
United by the bonds
marriage

06:27.242 --> 06:30.542
with from now on,
as a guarantee of your alliance,

06:30.643 --> 06:31.943
these rings.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.260
In the name of the Father ...

06:50.161 --> 06:51.661
and of the Son ...

06:51.762 --> 06:53.262
and the Holy Spirit.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.208
Laura ...

08:27.156 --> 08:29.556
And as in our childhood ...

08:30.758 --> 08:32.558
We made a pact.

08:34.059 --> 08:36.159
I made a promise.

08:36.961 --> 08:40.561
This promise, Laura,
I'll keep it for you.

08:41.763 --> 08:43.863
I will be all my life ...

08:45.265 --> 08:47.465
ensuring your daughter Lucie ...

08:48.667 --> 08:50.467
and his father, David.

09:30.908 --> 09:34.508
For the Father, his son
and the Holy Spirit.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.736
It's time, Claire.
Come on, get up.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.442
I do not want to go.

10:11.743 --> 10:13.543
Yes, make an effort.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.544
You work, you
think of something else.

10:17.145 --> 10:19.845
You agree?
See you tonight.

10:22.448 --> 10:23.948
Until tonight.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.880
Sorry.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.932
It is done!

11:50.334 --> 11:51.334
Bravo.

11:58.842 --> 12:00.342
Do not you feel good?

12:00.443 --> 12:03.543
Yes, but I wanted to tell you ...

12:04.945 --> 12:07.045
I took a week's leave.

12:08.047 --> 12:09.247
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

12:09.848 --> 12:11.948
I can not work,
not concentrate.

12:11.949 --> 12:14.049
Do not apologize dear,
I understand you.

12:16.752 --> 12:18.252
You called David?

12:19.054 --> 12:20.054
No.

12:20.155 --> 12:22.555
You could take this
week to go see him.

12:23.056 --> 12:24.556
Help you with your daughter.

12:25.257 --> 12:27.357
I'm afraid of ...

12:28.759 --> 12:30.859
to see Lucie.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.060
It reminds both Laura.

12:49.777 --> 12:51.577
Thanks for dinner.

12:51.778 --> 12:53.578
Barely touched your plate.

12:53.679 --> 12:56.379
- It was very good.
- Thank You.

13:15.399 --> 13:17.499
- Do you want to do it?
- But yes.

13:18.501 --> 13:21.501
- Are you sure?
- Sure, why ask?

13:33.814 --> 13:36.814
<I> Hi, is David,
I'm away, but ... </ i>

14:55.293 --> 14:56.793
Is there someone?

15:18.015 --> 15:19.515
Good morning lady I ...

15:29.225 --> 15:31.325
Sorry, just passing by,
I do not want to bother.

15:31.426 --> 15:32.926
Wait, Claire ...

15:35.129 --> 15:36.929
Stay, I must explain.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.330
There is nothing to explain,
You do what you want.

15:39.331 --> 15:40.831
Please, you must listen.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.233
I'm going to bed the girl
and I'll be back.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.534
Sit, drink something,
I'll be right back.

16:05.654 --> 16:06.854
PARENTS

16:07.155 --> 16:08.355
NEWSPAPER OF THE HOUSE

16:08.657 --> 16:09.857
101 recipes to delight

16:12.761 --> 16:14.261
And I went to bed.

16:15.763 --> 16:17.563
I'm going to have a drink.

16:32.779 --> 16:34.579
First of all,
I want you to know ...

16:34.880 --> 16:36.380
Laura knew.

16:37.282 --> 16:39.082
- Oh yeah?
- Yes

16:39.483 --> 16:42.483
I know you had everything,
but this kept secret.

16:50.892 --> 16:52.692
Before we got married ...

16:52.993 --> 16:54.793
I confessed that ...

16:56.095 --> 16:58.495
sometimes I liked
dressed as a woman.

16:58.996 --> 17:02.296
Only that, as a game.
For pleasure.

17:03.198 --> 17:04.698
He accepted it very well.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.200
All he asked me ...

17:08.501 --> 17:10.601
It was not to do it in public.

17:11.102 --> 17:12.902
Then now
she's dead ...

17:13.803 --> 17:14.803
Claire ...

17:16.005 --> 17:19.005
I never left this house
dressed as a woman.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.205
Nobody saw me as well.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.208
Unless you today.

17:24.909 --> 17:26.709
It was an accident.

17:34.718 --> 17:37.118
In all this time
with Laura ...

17:37.619 --> 17:39.419
He did not feel the need.

17:41.122 --> 17:45.022
Her presence, her femininity,
I sated.

17:46.124 --> 17:47.924
He loved her so much.

17:49.226 --> 17:51.926
It was after his death
he returned ...

17:52.928 --> 17:54.728
as evidence.

17:59.033 --> 18:01.433
<I> started a week later
Laura's funeral. </ i>

18:02.635 --> 18:05.335
<I> was alone with Lucie
in my room ... </ i>

18:05.736 --> 18:07.536
<I> trying to give him his bottle ... </ i>

18:08.137 --> 18:09.937
<I> but I would not stop screaming. </ I>

18:10.438 --> 18:12.838
<I> For two days
barely fed. </ i>

18:16.943 --> 18:19.643
<I> In that moment I understood
I missed Laura. </ i>

18:19.944 --> 18:21.144
<I> How I missed her. </ I>

18:21.345 --> 18:23.145
This shirt is from Mom.

18:29.552 --> 18:31.052
<I> And suddenly ... </ i>

18:31.553 --> 18:33.353
<I> the pain of his absence ... </ i>

18:34.154 --> 18:35.654
<I> his fault, disappeared. </ I>

18:37.657 --> 18:39.457
<I> The scent of Laura ... </ i>

18:39.758 --> 18:41.258
<I> his clothes ... </ i>

18:42.059 --> 18:44.459
<I> a feeling of fullness
I was overwhelmed ... </ i>

18:45.260 --> 18:47.060
<I> like I was there. </ I>

18:47.561 --> 18:48.861
<I> She spoke to me ... </ i>

18:49.162 --> 18:50.162
Lucie.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.363
<I> was inside me. </ I>

18:55.967 --> 18:56.967
Wait.

19:35.706 --> 19:38.706
Being alone with a child
to raise is very hard.

19:39.908 --> 19:41.708
I think that ...

19:42.209 --> 19:44.309
I could give you a
maternal presence.

19:45.611 --> 19:47.411
Every child needs a mother.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.512
And a father.

19:51.014 --> 19:52.514
I do both.

19:58.321 --> 19:59.621
It is temporal.

20:00.222 --> 20:02.622
Only a less brutal form
leaving Laura.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.823
To get used to his absence.

20:05.124 --> 20:06.924
You do not do for Lucie.

20:09.027 --> 20:10.827
It's for your own pleasure.

20:13.931 --> 20:15.431
you are a pervert.

20:21.338 --> 20:22.838
Maybe you're right.

20:25.742 --> 20:26.942
Please, Claire.

20:27.043 --> 20:29.483
Do not tell anyone, not to Gilles.
Just between us.

20:29.544 --> 20:30.544
I do not know ...

20:30.845 --> 20:34.145
If Laura's parents find out,
I care Lucie removed.

20:34.546 --> 20:36.346
- You know how much I love her.
- Yes, I know ...

20:37.648 --> 20:41.548
I want you to understand
as always he understood me Laura.

20:43.050 --> 20:44.850
No goals Laura in all this!

21:11.676 --> 21:13.776
Transvestite

21:17.080 --> 21:18.681
Crossdressing. As become
more feminine!

21:27.890 --> 21:30.290
- Goodnight My Love.
- Are you okay?

21:31.592 --> 21:32.992
You smell nice!

21:34.394 --> 21:36.794
Y? What did you do today?

21:36.895 --> 21:38.695
- Nothing special.
- Do not you get out?

21:38.896 --> 21:39.896
Yes ...

21:40.197 --> 21:42.297
- To a friend.
- Yes? Who?

21:42.398 --> 21:45.098
You do not know her,
a fellow high school.

21:45.999 --> 21:48.399
- Did you know Laura?
- Yes, a little.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.500
What you how did it go?

21:51.301 --> 21:52.801
There was more.

21:52.902 --> 21:55.602
- Not to get orders.
- Best.

21:59.607 --> 22:01.407
- I did not tell you.
- What?

22:01.708 --> 22:03.208
I called David.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.409
- David ...
- As there beckoned, I did.

22:07.110 --> 22:10.110
I suggested going to dinner
together on Saturday.

22:10.211 --> 22:12.011
So we distendemos a little.

22:13.913 --> 22:15.113
What did he say?

22:15.114 --> 22:19.314
Which in principle would be fine,
You should only get a babysitter.

22:22.318 --> 22:25.618
He told me that since the death
Laura he never left.

22:27.921 --> 22:30.621
- When did you call?
- A while ago.

22:34.025 --> 22:36.425
It is for you.
You do not answer?

22:37.026 --> 22:38.026
Yes.

22:47.336 --> 22:48.836
<I> Good morning, Claire.
How are you? </ I>

22:49.037 --> 22:50.917
Why are you calling from
that phone? You are crazy?

22:50.938 --> 22:53.638
<I> Sorry, I wanted to be
sure answer. </ i>

22:53.939 --> 22:56.039
What's up?
Why do you call me?

22:56.340 --> 22:57.840
<I> I need to see you. </ I>

22:58.141 --> 23:01.441
<I> It did me good to talk to you
and that you share with me. </ i>

23:01.642 --> 23:02.842
I go, dear.

23:02.943 --> 23:05.043
- We turn to speak.
- I beg you, Claire.

23:05.044 --> 23:06.544
Then I'll see.

23:07.045 --> 23:08.045
Who is it?

23:08.146 --> 23:10.246
That childhood friend of
I told you, it's heavy.

23:10.447 --> 23:12.547
- Do not sit well ...
- What happens?

23:12.648 --> 23:15.648
- Having trouble with her husband.
- What's it called?

23:17.250 --> 23:18.450
Virginia.

23:19.051 --> 23:20.551
Well, see you at night.

23:20.852 --> 23:22.052
Until tonight.
Good job.

23:22.053 --> 23:23.053
Thank You.

24:19.210 --> 24:20.510
Who is it?

24:20.811 --> 24:22.311
Me, Claire.

24:24.314 --> 24:25.314
Enters.

24:30.119 --> 24:31.619
Thanks for coming.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.720
- Did you get the scent of Laura?
- Yes.

24:35.022 --> 24:38.622
- That dress was Laura?
- Sure, the I retouched.

24:39.624 --> 24:40.924
You like it?

24:41.625 --> 24:44.025
Is to show me that dress
I did come?

24:44.126 --> 24:45.626
Yes, among other things.

24:48.429 --> 24:50.229
I think it's time
of the bottle.

24:50.330 --> 24:52.130
Make yourself comfortable,
I will look to Lucie.

24:56.535 --> 24:59.235
I love your lipstick.
It fits you well.

25:00.036 --> 25:01.036
Thank You.

25:01.137 --> 25:02.637
I'm coming, Lucie.

25:18.053 --> 25:19.253
Yes my love.

25:20.655 --> 25:21.655
But yes ...

25:23.057 --> 25:26.057
Look Who's here.
Your godmother, Claire.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.058
Smile at.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.760
It's amazing how
Laura looks like.

25:32.561 --> 25:34.061
The same eyes.

25:34.562 --> 25:36.062
- And the mouth.
- Take it.

25:36.163 --> 25:39.763
I'll get her bottle.
It's nothing, it's nothing ...

25:40.264 --> 25:42.064
Mom turns away.

25:42.865 --> 25:45.565
- What happens to you?
- It's ridiculous.

25:51.071 --> 25:54.071
This can not last forever.
it's crazy.

25:54.272 --> 25:56.772
I know, but found
Nothing better.

25:58.975 --> 26:01.975
- And your work?
- Paternity leave.

26:02.476 --> 26:04.576
Laura's father told me
I take my time.

26:04.977 --> 26:07.677
Why not take someone?
A full-time nanny.

26:07.878 --> 26:09.678
Lucie would have a
female presence and ...

26:09.679 --> 26:12.979
No, Laura promised care
it myself.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.580
I also.

26:15.181 --> 26:16.381
And watch over you.

26:16.582 --> 26:18.682
It's what you're doing today.

26:20.084 --> 26:22.484
Do you think you told him to Fuiste
Gilles to call me?

26:22.985 --> 26:25.685
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.

26:27.688 --> 26:31.288
I have a lot of sewing to do
and I ordered dresses online.

26:31.789 --> 26:34.189
My dream would be to go
boutiques women,

26:34.790 --> 26:37.190
do shopping and
buy large sizes.

26:37.791 --> 26:39.591
But I never dared.

26:41.894 --> 26:44.594
Laura had tons of clothes.
You can take whatever you want.

26:44.695 --> 26:47.695
- Will not you stay with anything?
- Yes, but kids sizes.

26:47.796 --> 26:48.996
I gain nothing.

26:48.997 --> 26:51.397
- Are not you going to put this?
- I would love to.

26:51.898 --> 26:54.298
But in here
it's a little hot.

26:58.102 --> 27:02.002
You should touch the shoulders.
But I look good, right?

27:02.203 --> 27:03.403
Yes, rather.

27:04.204 --> 27:06.304
I personally am
against the skin.

27:06.505 --> 27:09.205
It's an old animal.
It was my mother.

27:11.508 --> 27:13.008
Did you keep a coat
of your mother?

27:13.109 --> 27:15.209
If, as I recall.
I loved my mother.

27:15.610 --> 27:17.110
This dress also.

27:17.711 --> 27:20.111
- Is it because of it?
- Because of it, what?

27:20.412 --> 27:23.412
- That you dress as a woman.
- No, I think not.

27:23.713 --> 27:27.313
As a child I loved to dress up.
Especially not with her clothes.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.814
Yes ... with your clothes
sometimes inside.

27:32.616 --> 27:34.416
He would have liked
having a girl.

27:34.417 --> 27:37.117
No, I was delighted
of having a boy.

27:37.418 --> 27:39.018
My father too.

27:47.627 --> 27:49.327
- Shit!
- Who is it?

27:49.528 --> 27:51.028
My mother in law.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.435
- Claire!
- Good morning, Liz.

28:00.037 --> 28:02.737
- What a nice surprise!
- Yes.

28:02.738 --> 28:04.538
I came to take care
a little Lucie.

28:04.839 --> 28:06.639
How good of you
come to lend a hand.

28:06.740 --> 28:09.440
- I brought a gift to Lucie.
- How nice.

28:09.741 --> 28:11.582
I will give later,
It is napping.

28:11.942 --> 28:13.442
- David is best?
- Yes.

28:13.943 --> 28:16.343
- Are you resting?
- No, you're showering.

28:16.644 --> 28:18.744
A shower at this hour?

28:18.945 --> 28:20.745
Yes, I believe. It will not delay.

28:21.947 --> 28:24.347
I'm not sure
I have made.

28:26.650 --> 28:28.150
You're fine?

28:29.452 --> 28:30.652
it's difficult.

28:30.953 --> 28:33.053
You should come to the parish.

28:33.154 --> 28:36.454
I'm sure you would
While talking, praying.

28:37.456 --> 28:38.956
It helps me a lot.

28:41.059 --> 28:42.059
Maybe.

28:44.362 --> 28:46.762
What a beautiful couple did!

28:49.165 --> 28:53.065
With Robert, we decided to let
the house and Laura savings

28:53.066 --> 28:55.466
so you can raise the child
in good conditions.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.467
it's okay.

28:56.468 --> 29:00.068
No money and their parents
They did not have much.

29:03.072 --> 29:05.172
- David!
- Good morning, Liz. Sorry.

29:05.173 --> 29:06.273
- How are you?
- Yes ...

29:06.274 --> 29:08.374
I'm so glad to see them.

29:08.675 --> 29:10.175
- They are fine?
- Yes.

29:10.276 --> 29:11.276
The lipstick.

29:13.679 --> 29:14.879
What happens?

29:15.280 --> 29:18.580
- David! What happens?
- Excuse me.

29:18.781 --> 29:19.781
What happens?

29:19.882 --> 29:21.682
You must have eaten
anything wrong.

29:21.683 --> 29:23.783
The poor is not good!

29:31.992 --> 29:32.992
Sorry.

29:32.993 --> 29:34.493
Take a good hot tea.

29:34.594 --> 29:36.694
No, I think I need
something stronger.

29:36.995 --> 29:39.095
How is Lucie?

29:39.496 --> 29:43.696
It is fine, thanks to Claire
that helps me a lot.

29:43.897 --> 29:47.197
Laura always knew he could
trust your best friend.

29:47.398 --> 29:48.398
Thank You.

30:01.212 --> 30:03.312
Well ... I'm going, I have
to do some shopping.

30:03.613 --> 30:06.113
- Already?
- I have to have lunch with Gilles.

30:06.814 --> 30:08.314
Goodbye dear.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.315
Give a kiss
your lovely husband.

30:10.316 --> 30:11.316
Agree.

30:12.418 --> 30:13.618
I'll walk.

30:17.523 --> 30:18.623
Thanks, Claire.

30:20.125 --> 30:22.225
- I forgot to tell you something.
- What?

30:23.527 --> 30:27.127
Do not call me again with the
Phone Laura, removed it.

30:46.547 --> 30:48.347
- Did you get a dress?
- You do not like?

30:48.548 --> 30:50.348
Yes, but while ...

30:51.149 --> 30:52.649
I try as we left.

30:55.052 --> 30:56.552
- What?
- Looks Good.

30:56.653 --> 30:58.153
- What?
- Wait.

30:59.155 --> 31:00.355
What are you doing?

31:04.360 --> 31:05.860
You like it?

31:06.261 --> 31:07.761
I look like an old whore.

31:08.963 --> 31:10.463
No, you exalted.

31:11.365 --> 31:13.165
Did you get a nanny?

31:13.366 --> 31:15.766
Better yet, let Lucie
with my inlaws.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.667
For one week.

31:18.469 --> 31:20.869
He will do well to take
a little time for me.

31:20.870 --> 31:22.970
It is exactly what
I tell Claire.

31:23.772 --> 31:26.172
- Time is very important.
- But I'm scared.

31:26.573 --> 31:27.573
Why?

31:29.175 --> 31:31.275
Care of Lucie
not let me think a lot,

31:31.476 --> 31:33.276
but I'll be alone ...

31:33.877 --> 31:35.377
single without Laura.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.678
What you achieve, you'll see.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.779
We will support.
Claire Is not it true?

31:40.880 --> 31:42.380
Yes, of course.

31:42.881 --> 31:45.281
- Have they chosen?
- Yes, I want the menu.

31:45.782 --> 31:47.882
- How do you want the beef?
- On the brink.

31:48.683 --> 31:50.483
- I do the same, but juicy.
- Very good.

31:50.984 --> 31:51.984
And you, dear?

31:52.585 --> 31:54.085
I want the bass, please.

31:54.186 --> 31:56.886
I wanted the same thing,
instead of meat.

31:58.488 --> 32:01.188
Will you continue with the same wine?
- Yes, it is perfect.

32:01.389 --> 32:02.389
Thank You.

32:04.091 --> 32:05.091
Thank You.

32:06.193 --> 32:07.193
Lovely is not it?

32:09.997 --> 32:11.797
What? Is not it pretty?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.398
- For, Gilles!
- What's up?

32:14.899 --> 32:16.699
It has a nice dress,
It is true.

32:19.903 --> 32:21.303
- Sorry?
- Yes?

32:21.804 --> 32:24.204
- Services, please?
- Going down to the right.

32:25.005 --> 32:26.205
I will later.

32:28.708 --> 32:31.408
- When did you start working?
- Tuesday.

32:32.710 --> 32:34.210
We can meet
Monday, then.

32:36.012 --> 32:37.812
It does not think it's a good idea.

32:38.013 --> 32:39.013
Please.

32:39.214 --> 32:41.614
I want you to come with me
to do shopping.

32:42.716 --> 32:43.716
Will you go to Virginia?

32:46.219 --> 32:48.319
- How to Virginia?
- I mean ... as a woman.

32:50.021 --> 32:51.521
It would be nice as Virginia.

32:52.122 --> 32:53.322
Now comes, shut up.

32:54.123 --> 32:56.823
Come with your car at 14 pm.
I'll open the garage.

33:03.130 --> 33:05.230
I love him to David,
He's a good guy.

33:05.431 --> 33:06.431
No?

33:08.434 --> 33:10.234
- What's up?
- Nothing.

33:10.735 --> 33:13.735
- Yes, I see ...
- You were odious to the waitress.

33:14.236 --> 33:15.236
What?

33:15.237 --> 33:17.337
David comes from losing his wife
and incite to flirt.

33:17.338 --> 33:20.338
I just wanted to defuse the atmosphere.
He did not take it badly.

33:21.340 --> 33:24.340
Anyway ...
He saw that he was not interested.

33:25.342 --> 33:27.742
I always thought
I was a little ...

33:30.245 --> 33:31.745
A little what?

33:31.846 --> 33:33.346
He has something. is very ...

33:34.047 --> 33:36.147
- Female. it feels ...
- Oh, good.

33:36.448 --> 33:40.048
Yes. I'm sure Laura
and he wanted but ...

33:40.349 --> 33:42.749
I have the impression that
men are like him.

34:18.886 --> 34:20.386
- Did you finish?
- No ...

34:21.188 --> 34:22.688
No, but never mind.

34:58.424 --> 34:59.924
Dave, are you here?

35:00.626 --> 35:01.926
I'm coming.

35:08.633 --> 35:09.633
Hi ...

35:27.552 --> 35:29.052
Do you think go well?

35:29.353 --> 35:30.853
Why?
Not well?

35:30.954 --> 35:33.354
Try out with you,
but discreetly.

35:33.655 --> 35:37.255
I do not want to look at me walking
1m with a transvestite, 80.

35:40.359 --> 35:41.859
Then what do we do?

35:43.661 --> 35:45.761
Why do not you wear pants?

35:45.862 --> 35:48.562
No, for the first exit
I want to show my legs.

35:49.764 --> 35:52.164
- Where is the dress the other day?
- Which?

35:52.265 --> 35:54.365
- The one retocaste.
- It's dirty.

35:54.666 --> 35:56.466
- Go get it.
- It's all wrinkled.

35:56.867 --> 35:58.367
It's not a fashion show.

35:58.468 --> 36:00.868
Let alone to go shopping
and not to attract attention.

36:00.969 --> 36:01.969
Agree.

36:02.971 --> 36:04.771
I'll board a little.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.480
- Here it is.
- Very good.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.882
Did I leave the middle?

36:19.985 --> 36:20.985
I do not know ...

36:20.986 --> 36:23.386
- You should Otherwise, shave.
- No, let them.

36:23.487 --> 36:24.987
I do not want to
wait two hours.

36:24.988 --> 36:27.688
You must help me, because
I have hairs on the back

36:27.689 --> 36:30.089
and I can not take them off myself.

36:31.491 --> 36:34.191
- What a mess in this dress!
- Wait.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.093
- It is done.
- Thank You.

36:48.505 --> 36:50.605
Beware, it was not
well lit.

36:51.707 --> 36:54.407
It is that I do do
anything.

36:54.808 --> 36:56.608
We do not do anything wrong.

36:58.911 --> 36:59.911
Wait.

37:00.412 --> 37:02.512
Do not you have another
more discreet wig?

37:02.713 --> 37:04.213
I amounts.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.017
It is done!

37:13.922 --> 37:16.622
That's great!
I peinaste as Laura.

37:22.729 --> 37:25.729
- Is not it too much?
- Do you think I can recognize?

37:25.930 --> 37:27.430
Better not.

37:27.631 --> 37:29.431
- Where we go?
- To the city.

37:29.632 --> 37:30.632
But where?

37:30.733 --> 37:33.133
A shopping center,
It is full of boutiques.

37:52.553 --> 37:53.553
Claire.

37:53.954 --> 37:54.954
Yes?

37:54.955 --> 37:56.455
Does the wig okay?

37:57.256 --> 37:58.256
Yes Yes.

37:59.157 --> 38:00.357
Lovely.

38:01.258 --> 38:02.258
Come on.

38:04.661 --> 38:06.461
Then you call me Virginia.

38:06.862 --> 38:07.862
OK

38:09.564 --> 38:11.364
My first outing in shape.

38:12.566 --> 38:15.266
Should not you also
change your voice a little bit?

38:21.273 --> 38:23.073
- Good day.
- Good day.

38:29.780 --> 38:31.880
Have the keys
Car, Virginia?

38:34.483 --> 38:36.583
- Did you become silent?
- But no.

38:37.585 --> 38:40.585
- The put in your bag.
- What a fool I am!

38:47.293 --> 38:49.693
You're still not ready.

38:51.295 --> 38:53.395
You'll see what I can do.

39:19.722 --> 39:22.122
- They realize?
- I think not.

39:22.924 --> 39:24.444
He could have let me
the other dressed.

39:24.625 --> 39:27.925
But no, it's fine.
You mean you're credible.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.333
It is the same color, look.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.440
Smells.

39:44.242 --> 39:45.242
How nice!

39:57.755 --> 39:58.755
Look.

40:00.458 --> 40:02.858
- Is it too dark?
- It does not look good on you.

40:11.267 --> 40:12.267
Virginia.

40:14.069 --> 40:15.269
You like it?

40:15.972 --> 40:17.472
- Can I fit?
- Check it out!

40:18.073 --> 40:19.273
- It's going very well.
- Thank You.

40:19.974 --> 40:23.874
- It is not my style.
- Yes, it matches your hair.

40:25.176 --> 40:27.576
- It makes you thinner.
- It is true?

40:27.677 --> 40:29.177
And for the price, honestly ...

40:29.478 --> 40:31.278
Goodbye, have a nice day.

40:41.589 --> 40:44.289
- Shall we?
- Today I do not feel ready.

40:44.490 --> 40:45.690
Why?

40:45.891 --> 40:49.191
I already told you. I do not Epilate
legs and chest.

40:49.392 --> 40:50.392
Yes.

40:51.694 --> 40:52.894
It will be for next time.

40:55.797 --> 40:58.797
- You'd go out with me again?
- Yes, why not?

40:59.198 --> 41:01.598
- And Gilles?
- What about Gilles?

41:03.100 --> 41:05.500
- I do not know ...
- No incumbent and ...

41:05.701 --> 41:08.401
not understand.
We're going to start the movie!

41:09.803 --> 41:11.903
Wait, do not run it
that I have tacos.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.805
Look at this actress!

41:16.507 --> 41:19.207
- Would you let me?
- Yeah right.

42:19.668 --> 42:22.068
- Changing of place.
- Yes.

42:27.774 --> 42:30.774
Tell me the truth.
You like men.

42:31.476 --> 42:32.476
But no!

42:32.977 --> 42:34.677
Man in cinema
I was excited right?

42:34.778 --> 42:35.778
Oh yeah!

42:36.379 --> 42:37.879
Yes, but not as we understand.

42:37.980 --> 42:40.680
I was happy I
He takes over a woman.

42:40.781 --> 42:42.581
And you touch her.

42:43.383 --> 42:46.083
Claire, may seem
strange but no.

42:46.184 --> 42:47.984
I never attracted men.

42:48.686 --> 42:51.386
Now, women do, always.

42:51.687 --> 42:54.687
Maybe it's because I want
be like them.

42:55.689 --> 42:57.789
Have you tried with a man?

42:58.690 --> 43:00.190
Never.

43:00.791 --> 43:03.791
As a teenager I masturbated
with friends in the catechism ...

43:04.192 --> 43:05.692
But nothing more.

43:06.293 --> 43:07.793
Virginia How would you like?

43:09.395 --> 43:10.895
I never thought.

43:11.496 --> 43:15.096
But this is the first time I go
as a woman, watching me ...

43:15.997 --> 43:18.097
so you never know.
You have to try.

43:18.498 --> 43:20.298
Not to die idiot.

43:21.300 --> 43:24.900
It's all so new to me,
thank you.

43:25.401 --> 43:26.901
It's like a rebirth.

43:31.806 --> 43:35.406
You should not hold my hand,
There is a guy who is watching us.

43:37.609 --> 43:40.609
Do not worry, women
often they hold hands.

43:41.611 --> 43:43.211
Certain types of women.

43:52.221 --> 43:54.321
I would like this evening
it never ends.

43:54.522 --> 43:55.522
Ten.

43:55.523 --> 43:58.223
- I think you were right.
- About what?

43:58.924 --> 44:01.324
It is not just by Lucie
I dressed as a woman.

44:07.931 --> 44:09.131
What's up?

44:09.932 --> 44:11.432
I spotted.

44:12.634 --> 44:13.634
Wait.

44:17.238 --> 44:18.238
It is done.

44:18.839 --> 44:21.239
Gilles and not suspect anything.

44:22.241 --> 44:24.041
- Bye-Bye.
- Bye-Bye.

45:16.794 --> 45:20.394
This is what will happen in
little or longer.

45:21.799 --> 45:23.299
I have an urgent call.

45:28.104 --> 45:30.204
- David?
- No, Virginia.

45:30.505 --> 45:32.905
<I> See you for lunch.
I'm not good at all. </ I>

45:33.006 --> 45:34.806
Yes, but not before 13 and 30.

45:34.807 --> 45:36.607
<I> See you at your office? </ I>

45:37.408 --> 45:38.908
In the coffee shop across the street.

45:38.909 --> 45:40.409
<I> Thank you Claire.
Until then. </ I>

45:40.610 --> 45:42.410
Do you come dressed as?

45:42.511 --> 45:44.611
<I> No, I said it was Virginia. </ I>

45:45.012 --> 45:46.812
- Sorry, it can not be.
- Why?

45:47.213 --> 45:49.913
It is close to the office.
I can not take chances.

45:50.014 --> 45:52.714
<I> What are the risks?
The other time was all right. </ I>

45:53.215 --> 45:57.415
Well, see you at 13 and 45
in the lounge of the Mall.

45:58.917 --> 45:59.917
There you are!

46:00.318 --> 46:01.318
Hello.

46:02.119 --> 46:04.219
Sorry for the delay,
I have a lot of work.

46:05.221 --> 46:06.721
Do you let the glasses?

46:06.822 --> 46:10.122
- You asked me to be discreet.
- I think that's fine.

46:11.124 --> 46:13.524
I have only half an hour. I'll take
a sandwich, do you want anything?

46:13.625 --> 46:15.125
No, I'm not hungry.

46:15.326 --> 46:16.526
- Insurance?
- Yes.

46:17.127 --> 46:19.527
Good day, one of these
sandwiches, please.

46:24.633 --> 46:27.033
I like your skirt.
It Looks Good.

46:27.434 --> 46:28.434
Thank You.

46:29.736 --> 46:31.236
Do not you shaved?

46:34.039 --> 46:36.139
- Noticeable?
- Yes, a little.

46:36.840 --> 46:37.840
Shit!

46:38.942 --> 46:40.742
He employs a woman.

46:42.344 --> 46:45.344
- What medication are you taking?
- Nothing ...

46:45.745 --> 46:47.045
antidepressants.

46:49.148 --> 46:53.048
You know, our access to the center
Trade was like a trigger.

46:53.449 --> 46:55.249
I never felt so happy ...

46:55.750 --> 46:56.950
blissful.

46:58.152 --> 46:59.952
We repeat that ...

46:59.953 --> 47:02.653
I'm overwhelmed with work,
this week is difficult.

47:04.355 --> 47:07.955
Claire, you can not leave me like this.
I need you.

47:09.257 --> 47:11.657
Laura's parents stay
with Lucie until Sunday.

47:11.758 --> 47:14.158
We could go to his house.

47:16.862 --> 47:19.262
It is not impossible.
What would you say to Gilles?

47:19.663 --> 47:21.163
The truth.

47:34.877 --> 47:37.877
- All right?
- I end this mess.

47:41.481 --> 47:43.281
This scarf is mine.

47:44.183 --> 47:46.583
I found there.
My throat hurts.

47:47.985 --> 47:48.985
Charming.

47:52.089 --> 47:54.789
- I spoke on the phone with my mother.
- Oh yeah?

47:56.591 --> 47:59.291
- Not well.
- What happens?

48:00.893 --> 48:02.993
I think it's something missing.

48:05.596 --> 48:08.296
We could go see it
weekend.

48:08.297 --> 48:10.997
I can not, with these
office problems.

48:11.098 --> 48:13.798
But you can go.
You do not need me.

48:16.301 --> 48:18.401
I wish it
we were together.

48:18.602 --> 48:21.002
On another occasion
we'll go together.

48:22.004 --> 48:23.004
I promise.

48:46.928 --> 48:47.928
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

48:50.231 --> 48:52.331
What come loaded
for a weekend!

48:52.532 --> 48:54.032
Suit material.

49:00.139 --> 49:02.839
- What did you say to Gilles?
- I was going to see my mother.

49:03.540 --> 49:05.140
Would you lie often?

49:05.341 --> 49:06.341
No.

49:07.243 --> 49:09.643
I know only from
you dress as a woman.

49:11.145 --> 49:12.945
I will never lie to Laura.

49:24.357 --> 49:25.357
Here I am!

49:32.465 --> 49:34.065
- You made quickly.
- I just changed me,

49:34.066 --> 49:36.466
I maquillaré in the car.
You help me?

49:39.069 --> 49:41.469
- No one saw you?
- Yes, a truck driver.

49:41.870 --> 49:45.770
He saw me out of the men's room.
You must have liked my dress.

49:49.274 --> 49:51.374
- You want me to teach you a trick?
- Yes, what?

49:52.175 --> 49:53.975
For eye makeup ...

49:54.676 --> 49:57.976
right eye, right hand,
left eye, left hand.

50:05.484 --> 50:06.684
Great!

50:07.485 --> 50:08.685
It works!

51:37.775 --> 51:41.075
I remember. It was in the summer
our 16 years.

51:41.476 --> 51:42.676
Yes, I know.

51:47.882 --> 51:49.982
Well ...
What room you take?

51:50.183 --> 51:51.183
As you like.

51:51.184 --> 51:53.284
I parents because
there is a beautiful wardrobe

51:53.285 --> 51:54.785
and a large mirror.

51:54.786 --> 51:57.186
- I'll take Laura.
- Does your childhood?

51:57.187 --> 51:59.587
- Yes, it gives me pleasure.
- But the bed is small.

51:59.888 --> 52:01.388
It does not bother me.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.800
You feel good?

52:14.902 --> 52:15.902
Yes Yes.

52:19.206 --> 52:21.306
At seeing these pictures,

52:22.308 --> 52:24.408
Table, it gives me something.

52:26.511 --> 52:28.311
Were moments of happiness?

52:29.713 --> 52:30.713
Yes ...

52:31.815 --> 52:33.315
That is important,

52:33.816 --> 52:36.816
no sadness, only happiness.

52:42.122 --> 52:43.122
Okay,

52:43.523 --> 52:45.323
Are we going to walk?

53:01.340 --> 53:03.140
Would you push you?

53:23.361 --> 53:24.561
You see there?

53:24.862 --> 53:26.062
All up.

53:26.063 --> 53:29.063
We used to spend hours
making things.

53:29.064 --> 53:31.164
We talked and played.

53:45.679 --> 53:46.879
I can not find it.

53:47.180 --> 53:49.880
- Are you sure it's here?
- Of course.

53:53.985 --> 53:55.185
Here, look!

53:58.289 --> 53:59.789
It was not erased.

54:00.591 --> 54:01.891
its beautiful.

55:02.752 --> 55:05.152
I remember what you told us
when we were kids:

55:05.453 --> 55:09.653
"The boys are born in a cabbage
and girls in a flower "

55:12.256 --> 55:13.456
I ...

55:13.957 --> 55:16.057
I was born in a cauliflower.

55:43.685 --> 55:46.085
- What happens to you?
- Sorry, I did not recognize you.

55:46.486 --> 55:49.486
I switched to fetch firewood.
It is more practical as a man.

55:49.487 --> 55:50.787
Yes, of course.

55:57.795 --> 56:00.795
This evening, you prefer to dine
with David or Virginia?

56:02.397 --> 56:04.497
Whatever, I do not care.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.600
Gilles, better than
either with Virginia.

57:01.354 --> 57:02.354
Yes?

57:06.859 --> 57:09.259
- I have a problem.
- Which?

57:09.360 --> 57:10.660
You know.

57:10.861 --> 57:12.461
Not much, it's worth?

57:12.562 --> 57:14.062
You promised me.

57:16.465 --> 57:17.465
Agree.

57:28.877 --> 57:30.377
Is it too hot?

57:30.378 --> 57:33.378
Yes, but the pores
They should expand.

57:36.181 --> 57:40.081
- How much time is left?
- I do not know, 10 seconds.

57:40.382 --> 57:42.982
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

57:43.483 --> 57:46.783
- 4. 5 ...
- Come on, pluck it out!

57:52.890 --> 57:53.890
Are you okay?

57:54.792 --> 57:56.592
You have to suffer to be beautiful.

57:57.193 --> 57:58.393
Show me!

58:02.598 --> 58:04.998
We should have done
some shopping.

58:05.599 --> 58:07.699
No, it's delicious.

58:10.803 --> 58:12.603
I feel good here.

58:13.605 --> 58:16.305
I always dreamed of living
close to nature.

58:16.306 --> 58:19.306
Have a calm life,
less stressful.

58:20.308 --> 58:22.108
I should go away ...

58:22.309 --> 58:24.109
I do not know where ...

58:25.311 --> 58:27.711
and where it can restart
a new life ...

58:29.714 --> 58:31.214
as a woman.

58:34.218 --> 58:35.718
What is a woman's life?

58:39.522 --> 58:41.022
A life ...

58:42.724 --> 58:46.624
where you can do everything
I was forbidden to do as a man.

58:50.929 --> 58:52.429
Did you think really?

58:53.130 --> 58:54.130
Yes.

58:57.134 --> 58:59.234
With Lucie, you know
it is impossible.

59:01.837 --> 59:03.937
Yes, I know it's complicated.

59:04.939 --> 59:07.939
But while there is love,
everything is possible.

59:10.042 --> 59:11.242
You're dreaming.

59:12.544 --> 59:15.544
it is only a game. You should stop
and return to reality.

59:19.148 --> 59:21.848
But you also,
you like to play with me.

59:22.850 --> 59:25.250
Before we were not very close,

59:25.951 --> 59:27.751
but Virginia approached us.

59:29.954 --> 59:30.954
No.

59:32.556 --> 59:34.956
It was the death of Laura
that approached us.

59:42.564 --> 59:44.364
So our
dear Laura.

59:47.368 --> 59:48.368
By Laura.

01:00:35.015 --> 01:00:39.215
Good evening ladies,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:00:39.716 --> 01:00:44.216
As an exclusivity
Amazone, I present

01:00:44.317 --> 01:00:45.817
divine ...

01:00:46.418 --> 01:00:47.918
the mischievous ...

01:00:47.919 --> 01:00:49.419
Wicked ...

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.320
Eva Carlton!

01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:05.331
<I> I used to relate
something strange men, </ i>

01:01:06.633 --> 01:01:10.533
<I> as light as the
ash their cigarettes. </ i>

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:15.735
<I> evenings in Daban
Palace of Versailles. </ I>

01:01:16.636 --> 01:01:20.236
<I> They were just straw castles </ i>

01:01:21.638 --> 01:01:25.838
<I> and wasting my time
gold in the desert. </ i>

01:01:26.339 --> 01:01:29.939
<I> She was alone when I met you. </ I>

01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:33.441
<I> The others were buried ... </ i>

01:01:33.442 --> 01:01:35.842
<I> you were alive. </ I>

01:01:36.343 --> 01:01:40.243
<I> sings sang as a child. </ I>

01:01:41.645 --> 01:01:46.845
<I> You were happy as an Italian
when he knows that will </ i>

01:01:47.346 --> 01:01:50.646
<I> love and wine. </ I>

01:01:51.447 --> 01:01:53.547
<I> And for the first time </ i>

01:01:53.848 --> 01:01:57.748
<I> finally felt ... </ i>

01:01:58.249 --> 01:02:02.449
<I> woman ... </ i>

01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:06.650
<I> woman ... </ i>

01:02:07.952 --> 01:02:12.152
<I> a woman </ i>

01:02:12.453 --> 01:02:16.053
<I> you. </ I>

01:02:18.056 --> 01:02:22.256
<I> You had the air of a little old </ i>

01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:26.457
<I> where galloping
white horses. </ i>

01:02:27.459 --> 01:02:31.359
<I> Your face was serious
and clear your smile. </ i>

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.160
<I> I walked right
to your glow. </ i>

01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:42.461
<I> Today, no matter what we do,
we love close to you </ i>

01:02:42.662 --> 01:02:45.662
<I> time seems so short. </ I>

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:50.663
<I> Because you're a man
and you are tender </ i>

01:02:50.964 --> 01:02:55.164
<I> and you can do beautiful
our lives </ i>

01:02:55.565 --> 01:03:00.365
<I> you happy as an Italian
when you know </ i>

01:03:00.366 --> 01:03:04.266
<I> you will love and wine. </ I>

01:03:04.567 --> 01:03:06.367
<I> It's always like the first time </ i>

01:03:06.368 --> 01:03:11.768
<I> when he finally did me ... </ i>

01:03:11.769 --> 01:03:16.570
<I> woman ... </ i>

01:03:17.072 --> 01:03:20.972
<I> a woman with you. </ I>

01:03:21.173 --> 01:03:23.573
<I> A woman ... </ i>

01:03:25.575 --> 01:03:28.875
<I> you. </ I>

01:03:30.377 --> 01:03:33.177
<I> Women ... </ i>

01:03:34.179 --> 01:03:38.579
<I> O woman ...! </ I>

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.280
<I> A woman ... </ i>

01:03:43.581 --> 01:03:47.181
<I> you ... </ i>

01:05:01.156 --> 01:05:02.256
Are you okay?

01:05:02.657 --> 01:05:03.657
Yes.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.359
Are you tired?

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.760
No.

01:05:10.063 --> 01:05:12.163
There's something I did not tell.

01:05:12.864 --> 01:05:13.864
What?

01:05:15.466 --> 01:05:17.266
When Laura died ...

01:05:17.967 --> 01:05:20.067
at the funeral I was asked ...

01:05:20.268 --> 01:05:23.268
what clothes I wanted
it was buried.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:27.570
I proposed to
her wedding dress.

01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:30.671
And I asked them out
I who dressed.

01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:34.073
<I> are usually
them to do, </ i>

01:05:34.574 --> 01:05:36.374
<I> but I insisted ... </ i>

01:05:36.675 --> 01:05:38.175
<I> and accepted. </ I>

01:05:39.677 --> 01:05:41.777
<I> I was left alone with Laura ... </ i>

01:05:42.879 --> 01:05:44.979
<I> in the middle of a huge piece. </ I>

01:05:46.281 --> 01:05:48.981
<I> He was cold and fear. </ I>

01:05:51.985 --> 01:05:56.185
Then I remembered her smile
the day we met,

01:05:57.387 --> 01:06:00.987
their eyes excited,
the day of our wedding,

01:06:01.588 --> 01:06:03.388
wedding night.

01:06:05.791 --> 01:06:07.591
He gave me courage.

01:06:11.195 --> 01:06:13.895
<I> I started to put his socks. </ I>

01:06:15.997 --> 01:06:17.497
<I> It's slipped ... </ i>

01:06:17.798 --> 01:06:19.298
<I> delicately ... </ i>

01:06:19.999 --> 01:06:21.499
<I> on her thighs. </ I>

01:06:24.002 --> 01:06:25.502
<I> Then ... </ i>

01:06:25.803 --> 01:06:27.603
<I> I put her blouse ... </ i>

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:33.006
I buttoned her dress,
I put her jewelry,

01:06:34.108 --> 01:06:35.908
their shoes ...

01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:39.610
and I pressed gently

01:06:40.612 --> 01:06:44.812
<I> his wreath
in her blonde hair. </ i>

01:06:47.716 --> 01:06:49.516
<I> It was there, I think ... </ i>

01:06:50.818 --> 01:06:53.218
<I> that my desire to get
women's clothing ... </ i>

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.020
<I> reappeared ... </ i>

01:06:56.521 --> 01:06:58.321
<I> as evidence. </ I>

01:08:29.412 --> 01:08:31.813
- Good day.
- Hi.

01:08:32.915 --> 01:08:34.715
Are you okay?
Did you sleep well?

01:08:34.816 --> 01:08:36.316
Not very well.

01:08:36.817 --> 01:08:38.917
I told you that bed
it was too small.

01:08:39.118 --> 01:08:40.917
It's not that, it's Gilles.

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.120
What happened?

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.421
I left my cell phone in the bag
and I forgot to call.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.622
He called my mother and she
He said he was not there.

01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:51.323
Shit!

01:08:51.825 --> 01:08:53.325
You spoke with him?

01:08:53.526 --> 01:08:56.526
No. I left many messages,
I'm calling now.

01:08:57.627 --> 01:09:00.027
- Are you going to say?
- What?

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:02.828
You're in Créancy with me.

01:09:03.328 --> 01:09:05.429
And why should
to hide it?

01:09:07.432 --> 01:09:11.032
You have nothing to reproach.
That's what's important.

01:09:20.742 --> 01:09:22.242
I'll be right back.

01:09:37.658 --> 01:09:39.758
- It's getting dangerous.
- What?

01:09:40.059 --> 01:09:41.559
We must end.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.461
Finish?

01:09:45.162 --> 01:09:47.261
- Stop meeting?
- No.

01:09:48.964 --> 01:09:50.764
To dress as a woman.

01:09:53.067 --> 01:09:54.567
I thought you understood me.

01:09:55.869 --> 01:09:58.869
You're sick, David.
You should treat yourself.

01:10:03.775 --> 01:10:05.575
You're sleeping with David, is that it?

01:10:06.677 --> 01:10:08.477
Of course not.
What are you saying?

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.880
So why do I hide
exiting the weekend together?

01:10:16.083 --> 01:10:18.783
- He asked me not to tell you anything.
- Why?

01:10:19.384 --> 01:10:21.184
Because you were right.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:22.785
Wait ...

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.486
Any reason for what?

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:27.087
David found that ...

01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:30.389
who likes men.

01:10:32.492 --> 01:10:33.492
And so?

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:35.993
What's it to you?

01:10:36.694 --> 01:10:37.694
Y ...

01:10:37.795 --> 01:10:40.895
He needed to talk to me,
he feels guilty.

01:10:40.896 --> 01:10:43.596
Why they were to Créancy
to tell you this?

01:10:43.597 --> 01:10:47.197
Because there ... it feels good.
Near Laura.

01:10:52.103 --> 01:10:53.903
It's not easy, you know?

01:10:54.405 --> 01:10:57.405
It is especially difficult to assume
after his death.

01:10:58.607 --> 01:11:01.007
I feel good for David.

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:04.510
I know.

01:11:07.414 --> 01:11:08.914
Why did you say that?

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.515
<I> I had to say something. </ I>

01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:12.516
<I> If not, sorry. </ I>

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:15.317
it's ridiculous.
I'll look like a fool.

01:11:15.318 --> 01:11:18.918
Is less severe look like
homosexual and transvestite.

01:11:19.219 --> 01:11:21.319
<I> These lies tired me. </ I>

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.120
To dramatize
You should come home.

01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:25.321
What for?

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:27.422
<I> To see that Gilles
there is nothing between us. </ i>

01:11:28.224 --> 01:11:29.724
There is something between us, Claire.

01:11:29.925 --> 01:11:33.425
Yes, but not what you think.
Are you free on Friday night?

01:11:34.126 --> 01:11:35.626
Are you your friend Virginia?

01:11:35.727 --> 01:11:37.227
- Did not I tell you?
- What?

01:11:37.528 --> 01:11:39.028
- Not Free.
- Oh no?

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.130
- We will be only three.
- Well yes.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.734
- Good night!
- Hi.

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:49.735
- Between David. I'll help.
- Thank You.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.740
Claire!
David arrived!

01:11:56.441 --> 01:11:57.641
With your daughter.

01:11:58.643 --> 01:12:00.143
<I> - Are you okay?
- Yes </ i>.

01:12:00.444 --> 01:12:02.244
<I> Hello small.
Are you okay? </ I>

01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:04.445
- Goodnight.
- Hello, Claire.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:09.650
How are you?

01:12:10.552 --> 01:12:12.652
I still slept.
He did your bottle?

01:12:12.753 --> 01:12:15.753
No, I'll give you sleep well
and we will be quiet.

01:12:15.854 --> 01:12:17.654
She is very pretty.
How old are you?

01:12:17.655 --> 01:12:19.155
6 months.

01:12:19.256 --> 01:12:21.956
Let's sit down.
Are you going to get a bottle?

01:12:22.057 --> 01:12:23.257
Yes, come in.

01:12:24.259 --> 01:12:27.259
- You want to heat?
- No, it's warm.

01:12:29.162 --> 01:12:30.962
I should have been
as Virginia.

01:12:30.963 --> 01:12:33.363
- Why do you say that?
- It would be more honest.

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:38.167
I was hungry.

01:12:39.868 --> 01:12:41.868
Yes, it is gluttonous.

01:12:48.375 --> 01:12:49.875
Are not you looking forward to?

01:13:01.387 --> 01:13:03.187
But suddenly you came?

01:13:04.789 --> 01:13:06.889
Yes. Anyway ...

01:13:08.491 --> 01:13:11.491
I always
I attracted men.

01:13:11.592 --> 01:13:12.592
Who knows.

01:13:13.994 --> 01:13:15.494
Still before Laura?

01:13:17.497 --> 01:13:20.497
While we were together
I never felt like.

01:13:20.998 --> 01:13:23.998
He returned after his death.
As evidence.

01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:26.619
Today is not a problem.
They come from all sides.

01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:31.801
I see it at work. Quarter
types is homosexual.

01:13:32.402 --> 01:13:34.802
A lesbians
the note less.

01:13:34.903 --> 01:13:37.003
- What will you do with Lucie?
- It is true ...

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:39.304
deceased mother
homosexual father.

01:13:39.405 --> 01:13:40.905
It will be complicated.

01:13:41.907 --> 01:13:43.407
No, I think not.

01:13:44.409 --> 01:13:46.209
I also decided to go back to work.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.510
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:49.711
I need to return to normal life.

01:13:50.112 --> 01:13:53.412
My mother got a babysitter
which is responsible for Lucie.

01:13:54.914 --> 01:13:56.714
I also see someone.

01:13:57.215 --> 01:13:59.615
- Did you meet anyone?
- Yes.

01:14:03.319 --> 01:14:04.519
I see a psychologist.

01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:07.321
- A psychologist?
- Yes.

01:14:08.523 --> 01:14:10.023
A woman, very sweet.

01:14:11.825 --> 01:14:13.625
It helps me talk to her,

01:14:13.926 --> 01:14:15.026
Laura ...

01:14:15.127 --> 01:14:16.927
my future with Lucie.

01:14:18.729 --> 01:14:21.429
She understands me, without judgment.

01:14:22.731 --> 01:14:23.931
it's okay.

01:14:24.932 --> 01:14:26.732
You can not do wrong.

01:14:27.533 --> 01:14:28.733
It's late, I must go.

01:14:32.637 --> 01:14:34.437
I think I drank one too many.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.440
Do you mind taking me?

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.342
I order,
Gilles prefer it.

01:14:42.943 --> 01:14:44.443
It does not bother you?

01:14:45.144 --> 01:14:46.944
No, no, of course.

01:14:47.745 --> 01:14:49.245
I'll get to Lucie.

01:14:56.052 --> 01:14:58.152
- Y?
- What?

01:14:59.654 --> 01:15:02.054
- There's a guy.
- Because what you say?

01:15:02.255 --> 01:15:03.255
No?

01:15:03.656 --> 01:15:05.156
He has adventures.

01:15:05.357 --> 01:15:06.857
As I pregúntaselo.

01:15:11.262 --> 01:15:12.262
David.

01:15:12.563 --> 01:15:14.663
What it is this story
a psychologist?

01:15:14.664 --> 01:15:16.164
Thou counseled me.

01:15:16.265 --> 01:15:18.065
- Did you tell?
- Yes.

01:15:18.566 --> 01:15:19.766
What did he say?

01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:23.967
Each must find their way
to grieve.

01:15:25.769 --> 01:15:27.869
Claire, do we see the
next week?

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:28.970
No.

01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:30.871
It ended.

01:15:39.781 --> 01:15:43.381
Claire see much better.
Almost no talk about Laura.

01:15:43.482 --> 01:15:44.482
Oh yeah?

01:15:45.984 --> 01:15:47.484
it is funny.

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.785
When I met Claire was
jealous of his relationship with Laura.

01:15:50.986 --> 01:15:52.486
They were so close.

01:15:52.887 --> 01:15:54.687
I even thought I had
something between them.

01:15:54.688 --> 01:15:56.488
No, Laura always
Men liked.

01:15:56.489 --> 01:15:58.589
Of course, Claire too.

01:16:00.892 --> 01:16:03.892
- In any case it gave us ideas.
- Any ideas?

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.293
Yes.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.694
We decided to have a child.

01:16:25.012 --> 01:16:27.712
- Do you want me to help you?
- No thanks, it's fine.

01:17:46.692 --> 01:17:47.692
Well ...

01:17:48.393 --> 01:17:49.893
You have a good day.

01:17:50.094 --> 01:17:51.094
Good day.

01:19:29.392 --> 01:19:31.192
Shit!
Sorry!

01:19:32.595 --> 01:19:34.995
- I'm a mess today.
- No, play well.

01:19:35.296 --> 01:19:36.496
No, I'm not in shape.

01:19:37.097 --> 01:19:38.097
Look.

01:19:42.602 --> 01:19:45.002
- What is he doing here?
- I proposed a double.

01:19:46.904 --> 01:19:48.704
- How are you David?
- Completely.

01:19:49.005 --> 01:19:50.205
I was waiting for you.

01:19:50.606 --> 01:19:53.006
- Hello, Claire.
- Hi David.

01:19:54.308 --> 01:19:56.708
- Play the two.
- No, let's make a double.

01:19:56.909 --> 01:19:58.109
we are three.

01:19:58.110 --> 01:19:59.910
Play the two against me.

01:19:59.911 --> 01:20:00.911
Come on.

01:20:00.912 --> 01:20:02.712
Let's undo, Claire.

01:20:09.419 --> 01:20:11.819
- Are you okay?
- Very stressed.

01:20:12.821 --> 01:20:14.621
I like you more than skirt.

01:20:16.223 --> 01:20:17.223
Come on.

01:20:42.449 --> 01:20:43.449
Bravo!

01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:45.050
I drink.

01:20:46.552 --> 01:20:48.652
Why do not you call me anymore?

01:20:49.153 --> 01:20:50.953
I do not want to bother.

01:20:51.454 --> 01:20:53.554
You said it was
all it finished.

01:20:53.955 --> 01:20:56.355
- No, I told you ...
- I was scared.

01:20:56.757 --> 01:20:58.857
- Of what?
- From start over.

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.160
- Did you stop it?
- Yes,

01:21:03.762 --> 01:21:06.762
- Since we stopped seeing each other.

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:37.051
- Well ...
- Sure.

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:38.452
Sharapova prefer.

01:22:42.055 --> 01:22:45.055
- Would you like a ride?
- Thanks, I came with my car.

01:22:45.856 --> 01:22:47.656
And Claire?
You did not expect?

01:22:47.757 --> 01:22:50.457
Always expected to
women who shower.

01:22:53.761 --> 01:22:55.261
Shit!
I forgot my racket!

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:08.774
Are not you well?

01:23:13.379 --> 01:23:14.879
I miss Virginia.

01:23:21.086 --> 01:23:22.886
Claire!
Wait.

01:23:24.088 --> 01:23:25.288
Come with me.

01:23:53.317 --> 01:23:55.417
We can not do this to Laura!

01:24:03.426 --> 01:24:05.226
How took you!

01:24:05.627 --> 01:24:07.427
- Did you see David?
- Yes.

01:24:07.728 --> 01:24:09.828
- Is coming?
- He said he did not expect it.

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:33.370
Apology for tennis.
13:30 am-Hotel Virginia

01:25:14.992 --> 01:25:16.492
Good morning, Claire.

01:25:17.594 --> 01:25:19.094
Good morning, Virginia.

01:25:25.801 --> 01:25:27.601
Sorry, I lingered.

01:25:28.703 --> 01:25:30.803
I moved into a room.

01:25:33.306 --> 01:25:34.806
Here are ladies.

01:25:35.407 --> 01:25:36.907
I ordered champagne.

01:25:37.909 --> 01:25:39.409
For our reunion.

01:25:41.712 --> 01:25:42.912
- Thank You.
- Thank You.

01:25:56.526 --> 01:25:57.726
You made me fall.

01:25:59.928 --> 01:26:01.128
Sorry.

01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:05.330
It was during the dinner
home I realized ...

01:26:06.231 --> 01:26:08.031
I was falling for you.

01:26:09.733 --> 01:26:12.733
You were right. it would have been
better to stop, right?

01:26:13.534 --> 01:26:14.734
And in tennis ...

01:26:15.635 --> 01:26:17.135
when you told me ...

01:26:17.536 --> 01:26:19.636
"I miss Virginia"

01:26:20.337 --> 01:26:22.137
all awoke.

01:26:22.838 --> 01:26:24.338
I also missed.

01:26:27.142 --> 01:26:29.242
I can not waste my life.

01:26:30.244 --> 01:26:31.544
It's in me.

01:26:32.546 --> 01:26:34.646
Only you can help
to assume.

01:26:36.048 --> 01:26:40.248
What do you want to do?
Going shopping with your friend?

01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:42.350
Let's lie ...

01:26:42.851 --> 01:26:44.351
as eager as I have.

01:27:25.193 --> 01:27:26.693
What are we doing here?

01:27:30.698 --> 01:27:31.998
Do not say anything.

01:30:02.649 --> 01:30:03.849
What's up?

01:30:05.351 --> 01:30:08.351
- Sorry, but it can not be.
- Why?

01:30:10.854 --> 01:30:12.054
You are a man.

01:31:21.124 --> 01:31:23.224
What are you doing?
You are crazy?

01:31:37.038 --> 01:31:38.538
No, I am woman.

01:31:54.555 --> 01:31:56.055
There are Liz and Robert.

01:31:56.056 --> 01:31:57.556
- Good day.
- Good day.

01:31:57.557 --> 01:31:59.357
It's horrible, my children,
horrible.

01:31:59.358 --> 01:32:00.558
What happened to him?

01:32:00.559 --> 01:32:02.959
He was hit by a car
when he crossing the street.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.160
How is it going?

01:32:04.261 --> 01:32:07.861
This unconscious, in a coma,
They say it may be as well.

01:32:08.262 --> 01:32:09.262
It is atrocious!

01:32:09.563 --> 01:32:11.963
Laura left us six months ago
and now David.

01:32:11.964 --> 01:32:14.064
He is still alive,
not buried.

01:32:14.065 --> 01:32:17.465
You're right, but I think Lucie
which may be an orphan.

01:32:17.466 --> 01:32:19.366
- Where is Lucie?
- With the nanny,

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.467
we can not take care.

01:32:21.468 --> 01:32:22.668
Can you see David?

01:32:23.769 --> 01:32:24.769
Yes ...

01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:26.270
but ...

01:32:27.572 --> 01:32:30.272
- We should say something before.
- What?

01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:34.075
Tell them.

01:32:35.477 --> 01:32:36.477
is that ...

01:32:39.081 --> 01:32:41.781
David, do not know why ...

01:32:42.383 --> 01:32:45.083
It was found ...
... Dressed as a woman.

01:32:49.088 --> 01:32:50.588
- What woman?
- Yes.

01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:53.389
She wore a skirt and a wig.

01:32:54.691 --> 01:32:55.691
Oh yeah?

01:32:55.992 --> 01:32:58.392
I do not understand why
I was dressed like that.

01:32:58.393 --> 01:33:00.793
I think it would
a costume party.

01:33:01.094 --> 01:33:04.394
- It was early afternoon, Robert.
- It is true.

01:33:05.095 --> 01:33:07.495
Of course, that
Just between you.

01:33:07.696 --> 01:33:10.396
- No one must know.
- Keep us confidence, Liz.

01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.820
David.

01:33:37.723 --> 01:33:38.723
David.

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.040
Did you you know that besides
fucking he dressed as a woman?

01:33:58.141 --> 01:33:59.141
Yes.

01:33:59.942 --> 01:34:02.342
It is incredible!
Why did not you tell me?

01:34:05.646 --> 01:34:06.646
Excuse Me.

01:34:10.651 --> 01:34:12.451
Are you sure the little one?

01:34:14.153 --> 01:34:15.953
Yes, I am her godmother.

01:34:16.254 --> 01:34:19.254
How are we going to do?
We can not improvise.

01:34:19.755 --> 01:34:22.155
I will take leave and
I'll take care of it.

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:23.656
I promised to Laura.

01:34:23.857 --> 01:34:24.857
Thank You.

01:34:24.858 --> 01:34:26.958
Do not forget to give the bottle
in an hour.

01:34:27.159 --> 01:34:28.659
- Yes, good night.
- Goodbye.

01:34:32.163 --> 01:34:33.663
Lucie, how are you?

01:34:34.865 --> 01:34:36.065
We came to get you.

01:34:36.366 --> 01:34:39.066
You'll sleep at home.

01:34:39.467 --> 01:34:40.467
Lucie.

01:34:41.168 --> 01:34:42.168
I you open.

01:34:50.977 --> 01:34:51.977
It is done.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:54.679
There, that's it.

01:34:57.383 --> 01:34:58.683
It is done ...

01:34:58.984 --> 01:35:00.184
It is done ...

01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.620
David.

01:35:38.022 --> 01:35:41.022
David, I am.
I came with Lucie.

01:35:42.524 --> 01:35:44.024
Do you hear me?

01:35:45.226 --> 01:35:46.226
David?

01:35:47.027 --> 01:35:49.127
You are right to be
come with the child.

01:35:49.428 --> 01:35:50.928
Do you think?

01:35:51.029 --> 01:35:52.629
The more you are
present and discuss it ...

01:35:52.630 --> 01:35:54.430
more will help you wake up.

01:36:18.355 --> 01:36:19.555
¿Virginia?

01:36:22.358 --> 01:36:24.158
Virginia, I am.

01:36:27.262 --> 01:36:29.062
You are with him?

01:36:32.266 --> 01:36:33.766
Do you hear me?

01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:37.970
Virginia!

01:36:44.377 --> 01:36:45.377
David!

01:36:49.782 --> 01:36:51.282
Lady!
Lady!

01:36:51.683 --> 01:36:53.483
- What's up?
- He opened his eyes!

01:36:55.486 --> 01:36:57.286
Sir?
Can you hear me sir?

01:36:58.888 --> 01:37:01.288
- I swear he opened his eyes.
- I think.

01:37:01.789 --> 01:37:04.789
It happens, but not to
said to have left the dream.

01:37:05.791 --> 01:37:07.991
His presence makes him well.

01:37:12.096 --> 01:37:13.096
David.

01:37:15.399 --> 01:37:16.399
Hi!

01:37:18.902 --> 01:37:20.702
Do not talk very loud,
Lucie is sleeping.

01:37:22.705 --> 01:37:23.905
It's okay?

01:37:25.307 --> 01:37:27.407
Yes, just he fell asleep.

01:37:32.212 --> 01:37:33.712
I have good news.

01:37:34.413 --> 01:37:35.413
What?

01:37:36.215 --> 01:37:38.015
Max called me this afternoon ...

01:37:38.416 --> 01:37:40.216
and he decided to promote me ...

01:37:40.817 --> 01:37:42.317
and raise my.

01:37:43.419 --> 01:37:44.519
Great.

01:37:46.522 --> 01:37:48.322
You could rejoice.

01:37:48.523 --> 01:37:50.023
But, I'm glad.

01:37:50.424 --> 01:37:51.424
Well ...

01:37:51.725 --> 01:37:53.225
What happened?

01:37:54.827 --> 01:37:55.827
Nothing.

01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:00.130
David still in a coma ...

01:38:03.434 --> 01:38:06.834
It will take time.
Do not worry.

01:38:07.836 --> 01:38:10.836
I have the impression of being
living as with Laura.

01:38:11.637 --> 01:38:13.137
In the same hospital.

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.640
It is horrible.

01:38:17.842 --> 01:38:20.242
It's horrible, but leaves
looking back.

01:38:22.245 --> 01:38:24.045
Forget about Laura.

01:38:24.946 --> 01:38:26.746
Now it's David.

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:31.250
If you're right.

01:38:32.852 --> 01:38:34.352
Now it's David.

01:39:41.219 --> 01:39:44.819
I used to relate
something strange men,

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:48.720
as light as the
ash of his cigarette.

01:39:49.722 --> 01:39:53.322
Evenings in Daban
Palace of Versailles.

01:39:53.523 --> 01:39:57.123
It was only straw castles

01:39:57.824 --> 01:40:01.424
and wasting my time
gold in the desert.

01:40:02.126 --> 01:40:06.326
She was alone when I met you.

01:40:06.927 --> 01:40:09.327
The others were buried ...

01:40:09.428 --> 01:40:11.828
you were alive.

01:40:11.929 --> 01:40:15.729
You sang as a child singing.

01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:21.130
You were happy as an Italian
when you know you will

01:40:21.331 --> 01:40:23.431
Love and wine.

01:40:24.032 --> 01:40:25.832
And for the first time

01:40:26.433 --> 01:40:28.833
I finally felt ...

01:40:29.034 --> 01:40:31.734
woman ...

01:40:32.435 --> 01:40:35.435
woman ...

01:40:35.536 --> 01:40:38.536
a woman

01:40:38.737 --> 01:40:41.137
you.

01:40:41.538 --> 01:40:43.938
Woman ...

01:40:44.739 --> 01:40:47.439
woman ...

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.540
a woman ...

01:40:50.641 --> 01:40:52.741
you.

01:40:54.644 --> 01:40:58.544
You had a little the air of yesteryear

01:40:58.845 --> 01:41:02.145
where galloping
white horses.

01:41:02.746 --> 01:41:06.346
Your face was serious
and your clear smile.

01:41:06.747 --> 01:41:10.347
I walked right
to your glow.

01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:14.448
Today, no matter what
We do, make love,

01:41:14.649 --> 01:41:18.849
near you time
It seems so short.

01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:24.150
Because you're a man
and tender are

01:41:24.751 --> 01:41:28.051
and you know make beautiful
our lives.

01:41:28.952 --> 01:41:31.352
You're happy as an Italian

01:41:31.353 --> 01:41:34.953
when you know you will
Love and wine.

01:41:37.056 --> 01:41:40.056
It is always like
the first time when ...

01:41:40.557 --> 01:41:42.957
when I finally did it ...

01:41:43.758 --> 01:41:46.458
woman ...

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:50.160
woman ...

01:41:51.562 --> 01:41:53.062
a ...

01:42:16.887 --> 01:42:18.487
She has fun ...

01:42:25.895 --> 01:42:27.395
We are here!

01:42:27.496 --> 01:42:28.696
Who is it?

01:42:32.801 --> 01:42:34.601
- Good night, Gilles.
- Goodnight.

01:42:44.812 --> 01:42:46.112
I want you to meet a friend.

01:42:48.014 --> 01:42:49.014
But ...

01:42:49.615 --> 01:42:51.115
you, David.

01:42:53.118 --> 01:42:54.918
No, my friend Virginia.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.320
She is the mother of Lucie.

01:43:06.028 --> 01:43:07.228
Lucie's mother.

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:11.430
I'll explain.
I'll be back.

01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:32.351
