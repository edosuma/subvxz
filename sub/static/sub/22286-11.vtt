-WELL, YOU BETTER!

09:29.959 --> 09:31.250

09:45.583 --> 09:47.583
-ALL RIGHT, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

09:47.625 --> 09:48.542
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LIE.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.667
THAT DOESN'T PAY

10:21.709 --> 10:23.458
TAXES ON ANY OF THAT MONEY.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.625
WHERE DOES THAT MONEY GO?

16:34.500 --> 16:35.458
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

16:35.500 --> 16:36.458

16:38.041 --> 16:39.500
-HEY, THERE'S NO WAY TWO GUYS

16:47.542 --> 16:49.000
JESUS...

16:49.041 --> 16:50.375
-WELL, IT DOES LESS DAMAGE THAN

16:49.041 --> 16:50.375
BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

16:50.417 --> 16:52.333
COLLAPSE OF ONE OF THE GREATEST

16:50.417 --> 16:52.333
PROGRAMS IN COLLEGE

16:52.375 --> 16:53.583
SPORTS HISTORY.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.375

-I DO.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.709
-CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

17:24.750 --> 17:27.500
I THINK IT'S BULLSHIT THAT YOU

17:24.750 --> 17:27.500
ASKED ME TO SIGN A PRENUP AND

17:27.542 --> 17:29.083
YOU DIDN'T THINK TO ASK THAD.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.250
-OH, SHIT.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.583

17:31.625 --> 17:33.500

17:31.625 --> 17:33.500

17:43.083 --> 17:46.291
OTHER WAY TO DO THIS?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.208
-NONE THAT I CAN SEE.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.291
-OK.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.625
UM, I--

17:56.667 --> 17:57.625
-COACH!

17:57.667 --> 17:58.625
I GOT GREAT NEWS.

17:58.667 --> 17:59.542
I--

17:59.583 --> 18:00.959
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.583
-WE'RE GETTING GAY MARRIED SO

18:01.000 --> 18:03.583
I DON'T HAVE TO TESTIFY.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.041
-AH.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.917
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE AN

18:05.083 --> 18:06.917
EXPLANATION FOR THIS, I JUST

18:06.959 --> 18:09.917
WANT TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT

18:06.959 --> 18:09.917
WE'RE GOOD WITH THE NCAA.

18:09.959 --> 18:12.083
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

18:12.125 --> 18:12.917
-YOU DID?

18:12.959 --> 18:13.750
-YEAH.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.291
-HOW?

18:15.333 --> 18:16.917
-I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH, AND I

18:15.333 --> 18:16.917
KEPT COMING BACK TO THE SAME

18:16.959 --> 18:20.417
CONCLUSION THAT NONE OF

18:16.959 --> 18:20.417
THIS MAKES ANY SENSE.

18:24.041 --> 18:26.959
THE CREAM CHEESE, THE RANDOM AND

18:24.041 --> 18:26.959
SELECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS

18:27.000 --> 18:30.333
OF USC, OHIO STATE, MIAMI,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.333
AND THEN US?

18:30.375 --> 18:32.083
THEN IT DAWNED ON ME.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.250
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED

18:32.125 --> 18:34.250
TO MAKE SENSE.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.625
THESE ARE ALL JUST PIECES

18:34.291 --> 18:36.625
IN A GIANT ILLUSION.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.667
THE NCAA IS A FRONT.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.166
THAT'S IT.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.041
THESE SILLY RULES AND SELECTIVE

18:40.208 --> 18:42.041
INVESTIGATIONS SERVE

18:42.083 --> 18:43.542
TWO PURPOSES.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.333
ONE, IT ALLOWS THEM TO MAINTAIN

18:43.583 --> 18:45.333
A MONOPOLY OVER THE

18:45.375 --> 18:48.125
BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT

18:45.375 --> 18:48.125
IS COLLEGE SPORTS TODAY.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.792
AND TWO, IT ALSO ALLOWS

18:48.166 --> 18:50.792
THEM TO MAINTAIN

18:50.834 --> 18:53.333
THEIR NONPROFIT STATUS.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.125
SMITH WAS SO INTENT ON BRINGING

18:53.375 --> 18:56.125
YOU DOWN THAT HE LOST

18:56.166 --> 18:57.834
SIGHT OF THE BIG PICTURE.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.875
SO I LAID IT OUT FOR

18:57.875 --> 18:59.875
HIM AND HIS BOSSES

18:59.917 --> 19:03.000
AS SIMPLY AS I COULD.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.875
WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT

19:03.041 --> 19:05.875
TO THE NCAA?

19:05.917 --> 19:08.500
TAKING YOU DOWN, OR THE HUNDREDS

19:05.917 --> 19:08.500
OF MILLIONS OF

19:08.542 --> 19:10.458
DOLLARS THEY'D STAND

19:08.542 --> 19:10.458
TO LOSE BY GIVING

19:10.500 --> 19:14.333
BMS THE DEATH PENALTY?

19:14.375 --> 19:16.208
ONCE YOU GET PAST THE ILLUSION,

19:14.375 --> 19:16.208
YOU'RE LEFT WITH THE

19:16.250 --> 19:18.375
ONLY THING THAT MATTERS

19:16.250 --> 19:18.375
TO THEM.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.125
THEIR TAX FREE MONEY.

19:22.959 --> 19:26.458
AND LIKE SO MANY OTHER BIG

19:22.959 --> 19:26.458
CORPORATIONS, BMS IS JUST

19:26.500 --> 19:28.208
SIMPLY TOO BIG TO FAIL.

19:31.583 --> 19:32.542
-THANKS, ALEX.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.875
THAT WAS ONE HELL

19:32.583 --> 19:34.875
OF A SAVE, SON.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.166
-YEAH.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.166
I MEAN, I JUST HAD TO PLAY

19:36.208 --> 19:37.166
IN THE GAME, COACH.

19:37.208 --> 19:38.875
IT WAS THE CHANCE

19:37.208 --> 19:38.875
OF A LIFETIME.

19:38.917 --> 19:39.875
-HEY, EVERYBODY!

19:39.917 --> 19:40.917
SHUT UP, IT'S STARTING!

19:43.875 --> 19:49.458
-WE, THE NCAA, HAVE DECIDED

19:43.875 --> 19:49.458
NOT TO GIVE BLUE MOUNTAIN

19:49.500 --> 19:52.542
STATE UNIVERSITY THE

19:49.500 --> 19:52.542
DEATH PENALTY.

19:52.583 --> 19:55.917
[CHEERS]

19:55.959 --> 20:00.583
-HOWEVER, GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF

19:55.959 --> 20:00.583
THE CHARGES, WE FEEL SOME

20:00.625 --> 20:04.583
PUNISHMENT MUST BE DELIVERED.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.834
THE FOLLOWING COACHES AND

20:04.625 --> 20:06.834
PLAYERS WILL BE SUSPENDED

20:06.875 --> 20:10.375
INDEFINITELY AND THEREFORE

20:06.875 --> 20:10.375
NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

20:10.417 --> 20:13.417
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

20:13.458 --> 20:16.083

ASSISTANT COACH JON

20:22.125 --> 20:23.667
-NO.

20:23.709 --> 20:24.709
-WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO

20:23.709 --> 20:24.709
WITHOUT OUR QUARTERBACK?

20:24.750 --> 20:25.667
-THAD CASTLE.
