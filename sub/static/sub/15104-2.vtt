Narrator: On "ice road truckers"

00:05.306 --> 00:06.605
- Whoa!

00:06.607 --> 00:09.541
Narrator: ...It's a nightmare
for the drivers.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.943
(metal scraping)

00:12.146 --> 00:13.145
- My motor just cut power.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.947
She just cut half power on me.

00:14.949 --> 00:17.182
Narrator: As the fight
to keep moving...

00:17.184 --> 00:19.018
- Don't do this now.

Narrator: Throughout the north

01:04.065 --> 01:07.666
El nino's wrath is crippling
the ice road truckers.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.805
The weather pattern is causing
a severe heat wave

01:12.807 --> 01:16.241
That could result in the
shortest season on record.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.747
Many of the roads needed
to deliver vital supplies

01:21.749 --> 01:23.449
Have yet to open.

01:24.552 --> 01:28.353
And those that have

01:47.508 --> 01:51.710
Racing back home after
delivering his first haul
of the season.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.215
- Nine hours of this, eh b'y.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.784
Narrator: But the winter road
out of remote wasagamack

01:58.786 --> 02:00.652
Is quickly deteriorating

02:00.654 --> 02:03.155
Right out from under

Oh my god, my god, my god.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.528
We ran into this.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.464
I don't know how deep that is.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.432
But my arse came that far off
the seat when I hit it,

02:47.434 --> 02:49.701
So I assume it's about
that deep.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.437
And we were probably headed
right into the swamp there.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.673
So now,

02:54.675 --> 02:57.543
I gotta figure out
how in the hell

02:57.545 --> 02:59.545
I'm gonna get out of this.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.081
Narrator: Hundreds of miles

03:03.083 --> 03:06.285
There's no help coming by

Narrator: So it'll be up
to the company wild card

03:14.728 --> 03:18.463
To deal himself out of trouble.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.700

Back in winnipeg
at polar headquarters...

04:30.771 --> 04:32.371
- How much longer you got
on this trailer?

04:32.373 --> 04:35.040
We gotta get this thing
out here quickly so.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.043
Narrator: The boss is scrambling
as roads are finally open,

04:38.045 --> 04:41.046
But the window of opportunity
could close fast.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.217

in my yard.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.486
Customers are freaking,
they're yelling.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.488
Now that we've accepted a load
it's our responsibility.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.157
We gotta get them in.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.059
We'll get this thing kicked out
right away.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.460
I've gotta get loads moving fast

04:55.462 --> 04:57.462
And I need all the drivers
I can get.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.999

to expand the team.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.374
- Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.311
Narrator: And 22-year-old
hopeful, steph custance,

05:12.313 --> 05:15.080
Is looking for a shot
on the ice.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.350
- I'm a single mom,
I'm 22, my son's five.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.218
- Whoa.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.920
Son: Under ducking! Wee!

05:22.956 --> 05:25.490
- After I had my son
that's when I decided

05:25.492 --> 05:26.692
To go for my beginner's

05:26.694 --> 05:28.560
So I went and wrote the test
and I passed it

05:28.562 --> 05:29.995
And then I literally
just jumped in a semi

05:29.997 --> 05:31.330
And started driving.

05:31.332 --> 05:34.166
- You're looking to be a driver
on the ice roads?

05:34.168 --> 05:36.068
- Yeah, I'm hoping to be.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.703
- You got experience?

05:37.705 --> 05:39.404
- Very new, very new.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.809
- Why ice road trucking?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.177
- I like challenging myself.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.480
I think this a good challenge
for me and money's good.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.915
- You are coming to me
at the right time.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.384
I desperately need driver's
right now

05:52.386 --> 05:53.752
But you're gonna die o there

05:53.754 --> 05:54.486
If you don't know
what you're doing.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.188
I'm not gonna kid you.

05:57.358 --> 06:01.059
- Being a single mom right
from day one I got doubted.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.962
From day one and on my odds
and I beat them all

06:03.964 --> 06:06.264
And that's what I plan
on continuing to do.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.000
I can do this.
I know I can do this.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.203
- You know what?

06:11.205 --> 06:13.372
Um, I'm gonna have to see
what you're capable of doing

06:13.374 --> 06:14.706
Before I send you out there.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.108
- For sure.
- Why don't you stick around

06:16.110 --> 06:17.576
And I'll see if I can find some
time for you this afternoon.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.678
- Sounds good. Thank you.
- All right. Nice meeting you.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.413
- Nice meeting you.
See you later.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.217
Mark: I'm gonna put uh, steph
through some tests here

06:25.219 --> 06:27.185
And see what she's like behind
the wheel.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.920
We have a short window here

06:28.922 --> 06:30.722
And we need to capitalize on it.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.524
- Are you the polar puppy?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.493
Are you gonna tell daddy
to give me a job?

06:34.495 --> 06:37.329
Yeah? Yes, we're gonna hire you.

06:39.299 --> 06:43.168
Narrator: As new blood hopes
to break into the winter roads
game,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.737
In remote manitoba...

06:47.808 --> 06:50.308
Alex: This stuff here sure
doesn't look too good, does it?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.212
Narrator: ...An ice road's
legend returns

06:54.214 --> 06:56.948
To help anchor the polar squad.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.086
- Look there's crack through it

07:01.088 --> 07:04.055
Without anybody even driving
on it.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.425
I don't know what drives me
to keep doing it.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.894
I guess to some degree
it's helped keep me sane.

07:10.130 --> 07:14.299
(laughs)

07:14.301 --> 07:16.535
Narrator: Alex debogorski
has seen it all

07:16.537 --> 07:19.004
In his 40 years on the ice.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.241
Alex: Hold on!

07:23.243 --> 07:25.644
Just about gone. Just about.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.779
(wind gusts)

07:29.149 --> 07:31.950
Where am I?

07:31.952 --> 07:32.417
Whoa!

07:37.758 --> 07:41.193
Narrator: And through the
chaos, the 62-year-olds faith...

07:41.195 --> 07:43.495
Alex: Did you lose some weight?
- Nope.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.630
- Are you wearing a corset?
- No.
- (laughs)

07:45.632 --> 07:49.534
Narrator: ...And sense of humor
have remained intact.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.938
But now the grizzled vet

07:52.940 --> 07:56.107
Faces a season unlike any other.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.478
- This ice road trucking season
looks like a disaster.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.446
You see the fresh crack
through there?

08:06.220 --> 08:07.786
I see climate changing.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.188
The temperature is too warm.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.529
So it'll be a very challenging
season.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.131
Narrator: Alex's first big test,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.601
A newly opened crossing
that's the gateway

08:22.603 --> 08:25.470
To the community
of little grand rapids.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.206
- I can't drive on this side.
This side's blocked.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.575
That's why there's red signs
there,

08:30.577 --> 08:33.078
Which means there's
a problem with the ice.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.448
So I mean, that's a concern.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.916
Narrator: But warming
temperatures

08:37.918 --> 08:39.484
And a hot midday sun,

08:39.486 --> 08:42.554
Have already taken their toll
on the ice.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.123
(footsteps crunch in the snow)

08:45.125 --> 08:49.227
And now only a small section
remains clear for travel.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.964
- It's a short season and these
people need these loads

08:52.966 --> 08:54.599
And if the person doesn't
get over

08:54.601 --> 08:56.501
The loads not gonna get
delivered.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.975
Narrator: Despite the risk...

09:03.977 --> 09:06.511
- I'm gonna drive over it.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.079
Narrator: Alex will brave
the ice

09:08.081 --> 09:10.048
With his 20 ton load
of heating fuel

09:10.050 --> 09:12.417
That the village
is depending on.

09:15.455 --> 09:19.591
- And we're gonna have the door
open just in case.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.360
When I say, "jump,"

09:22.362 --> 09:24.563
I won't be here to say it
a second time.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.735
And we're gonna kind of roll
across this broken ice

09:30.737 --> 09:32.404
And hope for the best.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.006
(truck beeping)

09:39.179 --> 09:40.312
(engine hums)

09:42.716 --> 09:44.549
(ice cracking)

09:48.655 --> 09:51.623
Definitely making a decent
amount of noise.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.592
(ice cracking)

09:54.628 --> 09:56.328
Oh, this looks sketchy.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.664
Hope it holds.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.633
(ice cracking)

10:08.942 --> 10:11.509
- The ice looks really rough,

10:11.511 --> 10:13.845
You know, like it,
like it's been melted.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.817
Narrator: The two mile ice
crossing to little grand rapids
is dissolving...

10:19.720 --> 10:22.020
Alex: I hope it holds.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.022
Narrator: ...And can barely
sustain the weight

10:24.024 --> 10:25.924
From his 20 ton haul.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.761
- I think it might be a good
idea to go and stand out

10:29.763 --> 10:31.329
On the running boards.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.667
All this crunchy ice here.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.536
Narrator: To navigate a safe
path through the shattered ice,

10:38.538 --> 10:41.206
Alex deploys a veteran move.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.210
(engine hums)

10:49.850 --> 10:51.149
- This is a good place to stand

10:51.151 --> 10:53.084
If you think there might be
any problems,

10:53.086 --> 10:55.754
It's an easy way,
quick way to leave the scene,

10:56.690 --> 10:58.223
The scene of the accident.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.225
Narrator: Riding side saddle's
dangerous,

11:00.227 --> 11:03.261
But could also provide a life
saving escape route

11:03.263 --> 11:05.563
If the truck breaks through.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.800
(ice cracking)

11:14.174 --> 11:16.541
- Well, there's a little bit
of water.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.378
A little bit of water
on the surface here.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.248
(ice cracking)

11:27.054 --> 11:28.286
(ice cracking)

11:32.125 --> 11:34.125
We got about 100 feet to go.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.029
(engine hums)

11:39.900 --> 11:41.366
Sixty...

11:42.636 --> 11:44.002
(ice cracking)

11:45.005 --> 11:46.438
Forty...

11:46.440 --> 11:48.073
(ice cracking)

11:48.075 --> 11:49.541
Come on, baby.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.481
We made it again.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.950
We still have a truck
and a trailer

11:58.952 --> 12:01.019
And I'm not wet
so that's a good thing.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.989
Got to little grand rapids.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.725
Narrator: The old pro arrives

12:06.727 --> 12:09.594
With his crucial haul safely
in tow.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.631
- Now unload.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.936
Narrator: While alex offloads...

12:20.674 --> 12:22.774
50 miles to the east...

12:22.776 --> 12:24.609
(engine roars)

12:25.879 --> 12:28.246
Narrator: ...The competitions
on the move.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.549
- The road is falling apart
really fast.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.718
Narrator: Lisa kelly's scored
a high price load

12:33.720 --> 12:37.789
Of building supplies bound
for distant poplar hill.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.793
A 200 hundred miles trek over
a rugged trail

12:41.795 --> 12:43.428
That's just opened.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.931
Lisa: For being recently opened

12:46.933 --> 12:48.433
It's definitely been well used.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.734
Which is good,

12:49.736 --> 12:51.569
Meaning the communities are
getting their things,

12:51.571 --> 12:54.873
But that's also bad because
the quicker it wears out.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.244
Narrator: Over the past
24 hours the race has been on

12:59.246 --> 13:01.546
To get supplies
to the community

13:01.548 --> 13:04.048
Before the route closes up.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.951
- I'm gonna be super
on my guard.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.789
Narrator: And in the mad dash
the road's taken a beating.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.357
- Hold on.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.593
(engine roars)

13:16.630 --> 13:17.929
(truck rumbles)

13:17.931 --> 13:20.064
- I've always wanted whiplash.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.566
(laughs)

13:22.502 --> 13:24.469
Narrator: While lisa pushes on,

13:25.539 --> 13:27.605
100 miles to the northeast...

13:29.576 --> 13:31.075
(engine roars)

13:31.077 --> 13:32.510
Todd: Hang on.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.279
(truck rumbles)

13:34.281 --> 13:36.147
Definitely a bumpy road.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.517
Narrator: ...Polar's got
a live one.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.520
Todd: Got an opportunity
to get this load

13:42.522 --> 13:45.490
In to this new community
called north spirit.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.359
Narrator: Todd dewey's hauling
a massive 30 ton load

13:48.361 --> 13:51.396
Of building supplies
to north spirit lake,

13:51.398 --> 13:54.299
The heaviest haul
he's taken all season.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.601
- I tell ya what I don't like

13:56.603 --> 13:57.936
Is actually seeing
the temperature gauge

13:57.938 --> 13:59.838
And seeing how warm
it is outside

13:59.840 --> 14:01.372
(slush splashing)

14:02.475 --> 14:03.942
(truck rumbles)

14:05.045 --> 14:06.244
You know it's gonna be
a hard push.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.713
The roads are only open
for a brief second in time.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.150
(truck beeping, sputtering)

14:13.954 --> 14:15.820
What the hell is going on here?

14:17.123 --> 14:18.256
The motor just cut power.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.024
She just cut half power on me.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.326
(truck beeping)

14:21.328 --> 14:23.127
I've got her buried
to the floor and it won't--

14:23.129 --> 14:26.130
The turbo won't even spool up.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.699
Narrator: The motor's losing
power

14:27.701 --> 14:31.169
Making it nearly impossible
to pull the heavy haul.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.240
Todd: The truck is just not
running right.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.509
The truck ain't dying but it's
taking all the power I got away.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.011
(truck beeping)

14:41.948 --> 14:44.449
I got no power to pull this
type of weight right now.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.318
(chains clink)

14:51.124 --> 14:52.123
(truck sputters)

14:52.125 --> 14:53.358
Unbelievable.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.628
(truck beeping)

14:56.630 --> 14:58.696
(truck honks)

15:01.668 --> 15:03.468
- Don't know who it is.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.571
Darrell: (on radio)
what the (bleep) are you doing
there, grandma?

15:06.573 --> 15:09.040
Did you spill your coffee
in your lap or what?

15:10.176 --> 15:11.976
Todd: Son of a bitch
that's darrell.

15:11.978 --> 15:15.113
Narrator: Darrell ward's also on
the trail to north spirit lake

15:15.115 --> 15:18.349
With a 15 ton trailer load
of tanks.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.952
- I am having power issues.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.487
I don't know if I've got
a bad filter

15:22.489 --> 15:24.389
Or what's going on,
but I've got lights flashing,

15:24.391 --> 15:25.857
My turbo won't spool up

15:25.859 --> 15:28.593
And I'm having a hell of a time
getting up the hills.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.630
(chains clink)

15:32.632 --> 15:34.299
(on radio) I gotta stop here
just for a second here.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.934
- All right.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.671
(bleep), todd.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.741
(airbrakes hiss)

15:45.211 --> 15:46.744
Darrell: Strange seeing you
out here, huh?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.947
Where you going?
Todd: North spirit.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.615
Darrell: Same place I'm going.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.883
Got a little problem, huh.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.351
- Yeah, the motor's shutting
down on me.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.652
I got flashing light,

15:54.654 --> 15:55.887
I got a sensor or something
on the motor

15:55.889 --> 15:57.889
And it's telling the computer
to shut down.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.959
So basically I got idle speed
but this weight I got on here

16:00.961 --> 16:03.561
I can't get up the (bleep)
hills with the motor idle down.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.363
Looks like you have a really
light load on there,

16:05.365 --> 16:07.198
Just all empty tanks.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.403
- You want me to trade loads
with ya. (laughs)

16:12.405 --> 16:15.306
- Yeah, pretty much.
Pretty much. (laughs)

16:15.308 --> 16:17.809
- Todd's broke down and can't
pull the load he's pulling

16:17.811 --> 16:19.210
Because it's heavy,

16:19.212 --> 16:21.913
And I'm hauling just a load
of plastic tanks.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.316
- (laughs)

16:25.318 --> 16:28.086
I, I mean it's up to you
it's your call. I mean...

16:29.255 --> 16:30.321
- If you think it'll help.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.923
I mean, I don't care what we
need to do, todd.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.725
I got get up there
and get this load off.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.827
So do you.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.396
- Yeah, that'll definitely help
me out, definitively.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.765
- The competition is polar,

16:40.767 --> 16:43.101
It's mark it's not todd.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.937
I come up here to haul
these loads

16:45.939 --> 16:48.373
And get as many loads as I can.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.108
Narrator: Ever since fighting
over loads

16:50.110 --> 16:51.909
While working at polar...

16:51.911 --> 16:53.244
- You're done,
the door's right there.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.545
- Right on. I'm out the door.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.713
- See you later. See ya.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.749
Narrator: ...Darrell's been
at war with mark.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.150
- All right, thanks. Yep, bye.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.284
(beeps phone off)

17:00.286 --> 17:02.320
Stole another load from polar.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.189
Narrator: And two seasons ago
the rocky mountain log hauler

17:05.191 --> 17:06.991
Started up his own business,

17:06.993 --> 17:09.827
And took on his old boss.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.764
- You get the (bleep) off my
truck I'm leaving.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.665
Thanks for the load, mark.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.569
- Here.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.572
Narrator: But darrell abides
by the truckers code:

17:21.574 --> 17:24.375
Never leave anyone in the bush.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.610
Darrell: I'll put the rivalry
aside

17:25.612 --> 17:27.378
When a fellow trucker
needs help

17:27.380 --> 17:30.214
And these communities need
these supplies delivered.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.284
Narrator: Both bound
for the same location...

17:33.286 --> 17:35.520
- Keep my fingers crossed that
this truck stays running now

17:35.522 --> 17:37.321
And get this load delivered.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.524
Narrator: ...The two teams
switch loads.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.893
- Come on, girl, just stay
running.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.561
Narrator: But whether todd's
truck

17:43.563 --> 17:45.229
Will be able to pull
the lighter haul

17:45.231 --> 17:47.065
Is still a long shot.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.468
- That's a steep hill.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.370
(on radio) looks like a pretty
long steep grade.

17:52.372 --> 17:56.541
Narrator: And the first test
is an 20% grade hill.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.110
- (on radio) you gonna be able
to keep up?

17:59.112 --> 18:00.678
- (on radio) I'll be right
behind you, buddy.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.547
Darrell: (on radio) all right
I'm counting on ya.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.183
I don't want to have to back up
a mile to pick you up.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.586
Todd: Here we go.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.188
(engine roars)

18:12.592 --> 18:14.292
(truck beeping)

18:14.294 --> 18:15.593
Son of a bitch.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.763
Not now, don't do this now.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.671
I don't know if I can get
enough speed
I don't know if I can get

18:26.673 --> 18:29.273
To make it up this hill
in front of me.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.008
Narrator: ...A loss of pulling
power

18:31.010 --> 18:35.213
May have polar driver,
todd dewey, down for the count.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.648
Todd: Son of a bitch!
I can't get up the hill.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.389
Narrator: Even after switching
loads with rival darrell ward...

18:46.593 --> 18:49.260
- Keep my fingers crossed that
this truck stays running now.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.731
Narrator: ...The lighter weight
may still be too much

18:53.733 --> 18:55.766
For his weakening engine.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.469
Todd: Now, gear down
to friggin' low range.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.739
Narrator: As a last ditch effort

19:01.741 --> 19:04.575
Todd shifts to a lower gear

19:04.577 --> 19:08.112
Hoping it'll be enough
to get him over the top.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.380
(chains clink)

19:10.316 --> 19:13.384
(engine sputters)
todd: That a girl.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.420
Come on, come on.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.092
Come on!
(radio static)

19:21.094 --> 19:23.895
Keep pulling,
you son of a bitch.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.697
(chains clink)

19:26.699 --> 19:28.299
Come on, come on.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.670
(engine hums)

19:38.111 --> 19:40.378
Yee haw! Bam!

19:42.549 --> 19:45.082
Darrell: There's todd
right there.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.285
You gonna be able to keep up?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.120
- Oh yeah, yep.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.057
Narrator: While two heavy
hitters bear down,

19:54.594 --> 19:57.261
Back at polar headquarters
in winnipeg...

19:57.263 --> 19:58.930
- What I'm gonna get you
to do is

19:58.932 --> 20:00.531
Finish strapping down this load.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.866
- Okay.
- I want to see how you do it.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.501
I want to make sure
you do it safely.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.236
I wanna make sure
you snug it out right.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.637
Narrator: Boss,
mark kohaykewych,

20:06.639 --> 20:08.272
Is putting ice roads hopeful,

20:08.274 --> 20:11.509
Steph custance,
through the wringer.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.511
Mark: Snug her down.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.513
Good.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.948
I've got to get loads
moving fast

20:16.950 --> 20:18.783
And I need all the drivers
I can get.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.985
Steph: I really wanna be
an ice road trucker.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.253
I wanna get out
on the winter roads

20:22.255 --> 20:24.188
So I'm really hoping that

20:24.190 --> 20:25.790
I make some sort of impression
on him

20:25.792 --> 20:28.092
And it's good enough that
he wants me to work for him.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.729
Mark: Okay. You know
how important it is

20:31.731 --> 20:34.432
To stay away from that bar,
right.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.834
You start tying it down
like this right, right?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.169
Common mistake.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.571
That thing springs back it's
gonna knock you right out.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.306
You're out on the ice roads
doing that,

20:42.308 --> 20:44.108
Somebody doesn't find you
for two, three hours,

20:44.110 --> 20:45.977
You're gonna die
of hypothermia.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.311
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.284
- That a girl. Good.
- 'kay.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.152
- All right.
- All right.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.487
- All right, let's get
the next one.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.689
I gotta make sure I'm not
sending somebody out there

20:58.691 --> 21:00.424
With a complete lack
of experience

21:00.426 --> 21:03.861
Where she's gonna put others
at risk as well as herself.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.063
I'm gonna put you through
a little obstacle course
right here.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.799
Stick between the cones

21:08.801 --> 21:10.234
And then we got a bit
of an ice bridge there

21:10.236 --> 21:12.570
With a pretty good snow bank.

21:12.572 --> 21:13.571
I want you to blow right
through that

21:13.573 --> 21:15.106
And get into the next yard.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.775
That's stuff you're gonna
see on the ice roads,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.143
You're going to be going
through drifts.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.378
I want to make sure
that stuff like that

21:20.380 --> 21:21.545
Doesn't scare you. All right?

21:21.547 --> 21:22.880
- All right.
- Okay, get at her.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.184
(door shuts)

21:27.186 --> 21:28.486
- See how fun this will be.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.488
Never pulled anything
this long.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.932
Narrator: On the winter roads
a miscalculation

21:41.934 --> 21:46.570
By even a few inches could
mean landing in a ditch.

21:46.572 --> 21:49.707
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.811
Okay. (bleep).

21:53.813 --> 21:56.213
No that's good, that's good.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.450
Ahhh-ii-eee!

22:05.892 --> 22:07.124
(crunch)
oh!

22:08.294 --> 22:10.961
Mark: Oh, that's not good.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.630
- Is it supposed to make
that sound?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.265
- Argh.

22:14.267 --> 22:19.603
- I ran over a cone and I'm
just about to hit the fence.

22:22.008 --> 22:22.840
- Oh no.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.280
She's not gonna make this.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.452
- (bleep). Thank god.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.253
- (sigh)

22:36.255 --> 22:42.293
- Now I gotta break through
that snow bank right there, eh.

22:42.295 --> 22:43.694
(shifting gears)

22:45.765 --> 22:48.899
- Don't stop, baby.
Keep (bleep) going.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.368
(crash through snow)

22:50.370 --> 22:51.736
Ahh!

22:56.442 --> 22:57.875
That was awesome!

22:57.877 --> 22:59.276
(honks horn)

23:05.284 --> 23:06.484
Mark: How was that?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.552
- (bleep). Exhilarating!

23:09.489 --> 23:11.021
- How do you think you did?

23:11.023 --> 23:14.125
- Uh, all right, a little bit
hairy but all right.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.994
- Well, you know you hit
a few cones.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.462
- Yeah, I did.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.097
- You got time your turns
a little bit better

23:20.099 --> 23:22.066
Cause it's really tight
out there.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.536
You got a little bit to go with
your experience and everything.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.871
Let me think this over.

23:26.873 --> 23:27.805
- Sounds good.
- All right.

23:27.807 --> 23:28.839
- Thank you.
- Take care. Thanks.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.308
- Yeah. See you later.

23:31.310 --> 23:32.943
- You know, she kind of
surprised me.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.378
She wants a challenge,
she wants to get out there.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.946
I think she wants to prove
something to herself

23:35.948 --> 23:38.182
But up there this isn't a game.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.650
Yeah, we'll see what happens.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.152
I-I'm gonna have to give this
some serious thought

23:41.154 --> 23:43.154
Before I send her out.

23:43.156 --> 23:46.824
Narrator: While a hopeful must
wait to join the ice roads
fight...

23:51.431 --> 23:53.431
300 miles from winnipeg

23:54.467 --> 23:57.034
In canadian back country...

23:57.036 --> 23:58.903
(wind howls)

24:05.611 --> 24:10.347
- My, my, my , my, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my, my.

24:11.751 --> 24:16.053
Narrator: Polar's wild card
is just hoping to get back on
the road.

24:16.055 --> 24:19.390
- Happy days are here again, eh.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.961
Narrator: On his way back from
remote wasagamack...

24:23.963 --> 24:25.362
- (crash) whoa!

24:27.366 --> 24:31.001
Narrator: Art crashed into
a snow bank.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.671
And despite hours of effort...

24:33.673 --> 24:35.072
- Nothing.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.509
Narrator: ...He's been stranded
ever since.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.046
(engine roars)

24:50.356 --> 24:52.656
- What the hell is going
on here?

24:53.593 --> 24:55.459
There's something here
not right.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.097
Oh, no, no, no.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.565
It's got alat.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.436
Tire blew on the other side.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.506
We're (bleep).

25:09.575 --> 25:11.342
The tire come off the rim

25:12.879 --> 25:14.078
And now it's sitting there
in the swamp

25:14.080 --> 25:15.246
With the tire off the rim

25:15.248 --> 25:17.515
So even if we do get out here
I can't go anyplace.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.522
My only option at this point
is just to sit in the truck

25:24.524 --> 25:25.789
And wait till somebody
comes by.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.625
I might be here till
the morning.

25:27.627 --> 25:28.926
Cause as far as I understand

25:28.928 --> 25:30.895
I was the first one
to come up here.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.566
Narrator: With a busted tire
and night fall looming,

25:37.069 --> 25:40.771
Art's situation is becoming
more desperate by the minute.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.742
- Holy (bleep) is all I can say
about this.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.683
Narrator: In northern ontario...

25:52.685 --> 25:54.051
(truck clank)

25:56.122 --> 25:58.055
- Pretty (bleep) road
there, todd.

25:59.492 --> 26:02.893
- Bumpy and slick, buddy,
bumpy and slick.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.261
Narrator: After switching loads

26:04.263 --> 26:05.629
Todd dewey and darrell ward,

26:05.631 --> 26:07.765
Have put rivalries aside

26:07.767 --> 26:10.568
And are closing in
on north spirit lake.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.871
- Yeah, I got todd right
on my donkey,

26:15.775 --> 26:17.741
Chalking his load for him.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.812
Narrator: But whether todd's
truck with reduced pulling power

26:21.814 --> 26:24.048
Will survive the last brutal
stretch

26:24.050 --> 26:26.483
Is anything but a sure bet.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.259
(truck rattles)
darrell: Whoa!

26:35.261 --> 26:37.328
Holy (bleep) rough road.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.197
(on radio) take it easy.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.832
- All right, truck,
stay running,

26:41.834 --> 26:43.701
You got a light load on.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.005
(truck rattling)

26:49.976 --> 26:51.208
Todd: Yee haw!

26:55.147 --> 26:58.349
Narrator: Finally...

26:58.351 --> 27:00.217
- Rock 'n' roll, man.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.953
- So we're in north spirit.
My truck actually made it.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.723
Narrator: They arrive with the
first two loads of the season

27:05.725 --> 27:07.725
For the distant community.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.431
- Go give darrell a hand
to get this uh,

27:14.433 --> 27:17.635
Trailer unloaded and hope
we get out of here quick.

27:23.442 --> 27:24.975
- Todd, good working with ya.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.644
- Thanks, buddy, I appreciate
your help today.
- Absolutely.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.912
- We got the (bleep) delivered.
That's all that matters.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.748
- With a season like this

27:30.750 --> 27:32.549
You have to throw the rivalry
aside

27:32.551 --> 27:35.052
To get these communities
what they need.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.187
- All I gotta do now is just
limp this son of a bitch
of a truck

27:37.189 --> 27:38.455
Back down and get her
plugged in

27:38.457 --> 27:39.657
And figure out what's going on.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.558
- I won't get too far ahead.
Right on.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.560
- Let's go.

27:43.562 --> 27:46.730
Narrator: While darrell and todd
hit the road back to winnipeg...

27:48.401 --> 27:50.567
50 miles to the southwest...

27:53.239 --> 27:54.772
- Woo, made it.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.907
All right.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.076
Narrator: ...Another ice road
trucker's coming through

27:59.078 --> 28:01.512
For a community in need.

28:01.514 --> 28:04.148
- 'kay, I'm just getting
to my delivery point.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.283
Narrator: Lisa kelly,
pulls into poplar hill

28:06.285 --> 28:08.452
With her high price haul.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.758
(machine whirring)

28:16.495 --> 28:19.029
- Even just the last stretch
of road is start--

28:19.031 --> 28:20.764
You could tell the road
was starting to fall apart

28:20.766 --> 28:22.533
So I need to get out of here.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.737
All right, about time,
starting to get dark.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.445
All right, here we go again.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.314
(engine roars)

28:41.454 --> 28:46.957
Race against time right now.

28:46.959 --> 28:50.461
This road is falling apart
so fast I can barely hang on.

28:50.463 --> 28:51.662
(chains clink)

28:52.598 --> 28:53.864
I gotta get out of here

28:53.866 --> 28:56.467
Before the roads completely
falls apart, man.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.408
Narrator: As night falls...

29:11.083 --> 29:12.282
Narrator: ...A heavy snow flurry

29:12.284 --> 29:16.120
Is making for a slick surface
on the road.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.256
- I'm coming up to suicide hill.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.725
Narrator: And as lisa
approaches a steep incline,

29:21.727 --> 29:24.161
Nicknamed suicide hill...

29:24.163 --> 29:26.997
Lisa: Nice and slicked up
by snow here.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.832
Narrator: ...It'll be like
trying to gun it

29:28.834 --> 29:31.001
Straight up an ice rink.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.836
- This gonna be a rough ride.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.778
Hope that I can just make it.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.281
(engine roars)

29:50.623 --> 29:52.289
Not good.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.025
Aghh, there she goes.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.997
(engine whines)
ahh, just spinning.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.307
Narrator: 300 miles from
winnipeg...

30:11.744 --> 30:13.343
(wind howls)

30:15.147 --> 30:20.617
Narrator: An ice road trucker
is stuck dead in his tracks.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.827
Big (bleep) capital letters:
You're (bleep).

30:30.763 --> 30:32.429
They were right on today.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.736
Narrator: For nearly 20 hours...

30:39.738 --> 30:41.672
- Isn't this wonderful?

30:41.674 --> 30:43.507
Narrator: ...Art burke's been
stranded.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.714
(door shuts)
- brrr.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.182
Narrator: And all he can do
is burn

30:52.184 --> 30:56.086
What's left of his precious
fuel to keep him warm

30:56.088 --> 30:59.723
Until help arrives or not.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.631
- I'm definitely stuck here
for the night.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.168
(laughs)

31:11.170 --> 31:15.072
And I don't know how many nights
to tell you the truth, eh.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.707
Till somebody comes along.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.308
(wind howls)

31:18.310 --> 31:21.011
I got three quarters
of a tank and diesel.

31:21.013 --> 31:24.281
I got four, five cans of beans
back there.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.383
Half a cold cup of coffee,

31:26.385 --> 31:28.619
Wonder bread, jug of milk.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.656
Lots, whole box of matches
that they gave me.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.558
(wind howls)

31:36.462 --> 31:38.862
I'm gonna give that a little
rub, man.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.198
I was given this
to keep me safe.

31:43.202 --> 31:46.270
You watch, something to come.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.977
What do you do, b'y,
just sit here and wait...

31:53.979 --> 31:55.646
(honk in distance)

31:55.648 --> 31:57.514
What do we got going
on over here b'y?

32:02.187 --> 32:05.689
Ooh, just a second there
while I check this out.

32:05.691 --> 32:09.026
Narrator: Finally a potential
lifeline.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.294
Art: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.764
This looks good, eh.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.967
This looks really good.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.201
See, I tell you, b'y,

32:18.203 --> 32:19.436
I know I wasn't gonna freeze
to death.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.204
(door slams)

32:22.308 --> 32:24.641
I've been waiting to see you
all day long my friend.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.910
I'm so happy to see you, man.
I'll tell ya.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.747
Narrator: A passing crew
maintaining the road

32:30.749 --> 32:34.384
Could be art's last chance
at freedom.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.587
- You get her? Good man, buddy.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.724
Hook some chains on her
and see if we can't yank it

32:40.726 --> 32:42.292
Out of the (bleep) swamp.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.465
So we're all set?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.000
I hope this works.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.339
(engine roars, truck creaks)

32:55.341 --> 32:59.343
Narrator: The team tries to
pull art out with a loader.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.978
(creaking)

33:03.549 --> 33:05.949
Art: Come on, come on, come on!

33:07.586 --> 33:09.853
Narrator: But the big rig
ain't leaving the snow bank

33:09.855 --> 33:11.521
Without a fight.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.524
(beeping)

33:16.462 --> 33:17.928
(engine revs)

33:19.131 --> 33:20.931
Art: Come on!

33:22.735 --> 33:25.168
(creaking)

33:25.170 --> 33:26.837
(tire spinning)

33:28.374 --> 33:30.841
There we go, b'y.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.248
(rim scraping)

33:40.853 --> 33:42.753
Narrator: Art may be out
of the snow...

33:42.755 --> 33:45.122
- That-that there rim is ruined
now.

33:45.124 --> 33:48.692
Narrator: But his troubles
are far from over.

33:48.694 --> 33:52.195
- The (bleep) hit too (bleep)
hard and bent the (bleep) rim

33:52.197 --> 33:53.964
And all the air come out
and that helped drive me

33:53.966 --> 33:55.766
Into the (bleep) woods.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.336
- No.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.843
I don't have a (bleep) nut
or a wrench or nothing.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.450
Narrator: There's no way
to go anywhere

34:13.452 --> 34:16.086
Without a tire on the front
axle.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.155
If he can't find a solution soon

34:18.157 --> 34:21.058
He'll have to abandon
his truck and trailer

34:21.060 --> 34:25.062
And polar will take a financial
hit that could be crippling.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.432
- What do you think?

34:31.804 --> 34:34.037
- Hey, whatever works, buddy.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.274
So now we're gonna take
the tire off the back

34:37.276 --> 34:38.775
And put it on the (bleep) front

34:38.777 --> 34:40.677
And see if that work, eh.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.314
Narrator: The team will try to
grab a tire from the trailer

34:44.316 --> 34:46.316
And install it up front.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.353
But trailer and truck tires
are different sizes.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.256
So the plan is sketchy at best.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.758
(nut clanks)

34:54.760 --> 34:57.961
- Hopefully, hopefully, it will
get me the (bleep) out of here.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.763
Sometime this week.

35:11.043 --> 35:12.943
There we go, b'y.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.546
Good people here, man.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.215
Very good people here.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.816
And they know what they're
doing too, eh.

35:19.818 --> 35:23.086
Obviously.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.455
Men: Good to go. (laughing)

35:25.457 --> 35:27.557
Narrator: Art's back in
business...

35:27.559 --> 35:30.127
- So I guess I'm off,
thanks again, man.

35:32.498 --> 35:35.899
I'm gonna get back in the truck
(laughs)

35:35.901 --> 35:39.603
Ride down the road and just see
what the (bleep) is gonna
happen next.

35:39.605 --> 35:40.804
Narrator: .And will hammer down

35:40.806 --> 35:44.107
The final 300 miles
back to winnipeg.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.909
Art: (laughs)

35:45.911 --> 35:47.377
Thank you.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.713
(honks horn)

35:50.983 --> 35:52.616
What a (bleep) (bleep) show.

35:54.253 --> 35:57.220
Narrator: While art's finally
won his battle,

35:57.222 --> 35:59.456
100 miles to the south...

35:59.458 --> 36:01.124
(wind gusts)

36:03.428 --> 36:05.529
(tires spinning)

36:06.498 --> 36:08.999
- Spinning it to death.

36:09.001 --> 36:12.869
Narrator: Rival business owner
lisa kelly's facing a fight
of her own.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.840
- (bleep) man. I can't make it
up this hill.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.544
Narrator: A steep incline
nicknamed suicide hill

36:20.546 --> 36:23.213
Has proven too much
to overcome.

36:26.552 --> 36:30.120
- Try to back down.
Try to go at it again.

36:31.056 --> 36:32.322
Try to take it slow here,

36:32.324 --> 36:34.591
So I don't get out of control
down this hill.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.260
Hopefully my trailer
will stay in control.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.062
Narrator: Maneuvering
the trailer backwards

36:39.064 --> 36:43.166
Down the slick surface
could be a recipe for disaster.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.238
- Okay, don't slide,
you stupid piece of (bleep).

36:53.612 --> 36:56.146
Easy, easy, easy, easy!

36:56.148 --> 36:58.582
Okay, why is everything sliding?

37:02.988 --> 37:04.454
Whoa.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.825
It's getting out of control.

37:10.128 --> 37:11.528
Whoa!

37:14.066 --> 37:15.398
Oh (bleep)!

37:15.400 --> 37:17.801
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

37:17.803 --> 37:19.402
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:19.404 --> 37:21.204
(crash)

37:21.206 --> 37:25.208
Boom into the ditch.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.244
Now ep).

37:27.246 --> 37:29.579
Now I'm (bleep).

37:29.581 --> 37:32.315
Can't go forward,
can't go backwards.

37:32.317 --> 37:33.750
Narrator: Backing down a slick
hill,

37:33.752 --> 37:35.552
She's crashed into a snow bank

37:35.554 --> 37:37.420
And now in the dead of night,

37:37.422 --> 37:39.856
She's hopelessly stuck.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.828
- I'm never gonna make it
up this thing.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.066
(wind howls)

37:57.409 --> 37:59.109
(horn honks)

38:01.580 --> 38:03.980
Narrator: But there may be
light at the end of the tunnel.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.218
Lisa: I am completely blocking
the entire road

38:08.220 --> 38:10.053
'cause they can't get past me.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.090
They need to pull the ass-end
of my trailer around

38:14.092 --> 38:16.893
Is what they have to do.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.862
Then maybe I can get off
this hill.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.833
One of you guys wanna pull the
ass-end of my trailer straight?

38:25.237 --> 38:26.836
Cause that's the only reason
I can't get down

38:26.838 --> 38:28.271
It's because my trailer slid
that way.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.107
If we could pull this that way

38:31.109 --> 38:32.575
I'd be good.

38:35.213 --> 38:36.680
- If they give it a good jerk,

38:36.682 --> 38:39.416
They should be able
to pull it around.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.785
Cause then I could back down.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.086
Man: Come on back.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.593
- All right, let's give her
a shot I guess.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.330
(tires spinning)

38:57.803 --> 39:00.036
You might have to get a run
at it.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.438
(engine whines)

39:03.275 --> 39:04.374
All right.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.676
Okay, okay, okay.
That's not happening.

39:09.281 --> 39:12.782
Well, can I drive your truck?

39:16.254 --> 39:17.320
I-I'll be gentle.

39:17.322 --> 39:19.322
If you don't like it
make me stop.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.762
(tires spinning)

39:25.764 --> 39:27.230
(groaning)

39:35.474 --> 39:37.874
Woo. Made it.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.844
Thank you for the use
of your truck.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.512
(horn honks)

39:42.514 --> 39:44.981
Narrator: Lisa's back on
the road...

39:44.983 --> 39:46.383
Lisa: I just don't wanna
(bleep) this up.

39:46.385 --> 39:48.017
I want to get off this hill.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.686
Narrator: ...But she's still got
to back up

39:49.688 --> 39:52.322
And try to make it over
suicide hill.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.093
- Try to take it slow.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.732
Oh.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.467
Oh, come on.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.206
(tires crunch on snow)

40:11.343 --> 40:12.942
I've got it.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.650
(chains clink)

40:20.652 --> 40:23.052
Yay!

40:23.054 --> 40:24.554
Narrator: Finally at the bottom,

40:24.556 --> 40:27.657
Now it's time to try
and conquer the beast.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.094
- All right, here I go.

40:32.431 --> 40:37.333
Now I gotta focus here
so we can (bleep) make this.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.438
All about momentum I'm hoping.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.711
This gonna be a rough ride.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.582
Hold on!

40:53.518 --> 40:54.751
(engine roars)

41:04.329 --> 41:06.496
Oh my gosh, I made it!

41:06.498 --> 41:09.666
Narrator: Lisa's beaten
her nemesis.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.067
- Oh my gosh.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.803
Dude, I've never drifted
that much on a hill before
in my life.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.939
It was just like coming up,
going around the corner

41:15.941 --> 41:17.073
I'm just like shoooo,

41:17.075 --> 41:18.308
Bounce off this ditch

41:18.310 --> 41:21.077
I'm like, errr-errr,

41:21.079 --> 41:23.146
Then it still made it up
to the top.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.984
This season is absolutely crazy.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.752
I am out of here.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.625
(wind gusts)

41:38.463 --> 41:40.964
Narrator: Next time
on "ice road truckers"...

41:40.966 --> 41:42.732
- Wow.

41:42.734 --> 41:45.235
Holy (bleep), eh.

41:45.237 --> 41:47.604
Narrator: ...The winter roads
fight back.

41:47.606 --> 41:50.139
Darrell: I have myself
in a (bleep) jam.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.508
Whoa!

41:51.510 --> 41:53.076
(crash)

41:53.078 --> 41:54.677
Lisa: What the heck was that?

41:54.679 --> 41:56.246
I can't turn the wheel at all.

41:56.248 --> 41:57.847
This is gonna be bad.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.249
Narrator: And for one driver...

41:59.251 --> 42:01.251
- Don't come near me
for (bleep) sakes.

42:01.253 --> 42:03.453
Narrator: ...It could be
their breaking point.

42:03.455 --> 42:05.522
- Get the (bleep) away from me!

42:05.524 --> 42:06.890
(ice cracking)
