00:00.001 --> 00:01.373
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:01.383 --> 00:04.467
I wouldn't. Playing with time
is such difficult magic.

00:04.477 --> 00:06.115
This is Jane Chatwin, all grown up.

00:06.125 --> 00:08.229
We know about the time loops
that you keep making.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.473
- As you should by now.
- Prince Ess of Loria.

00:12.668 --> 00:14.613
I like you.

00:15.169 --> 00:18.154
Tick, you're going to go
to that fairy repellent hallway

00:18.164 --> 00:20.991
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

00:21.001 --> 00:23.313
You're gonna put it
in the fairy queen's bath.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.953
I'm gonna cut out her heart and eat it.

00:24.963 --> 00:27.196
No, come on, Penny.
Don't... don't... Come on.

00:27.553 --> 00:29.076
I was astral projecting.

00:29.086 --> 00:30.934
I wasn't in my body when I died.

00:30.944 --> 00:32.512
Thank you.

00:32.523 --> 00:34.570
You're missing the signs, Julia.

00:34.580 --> 00:36.739
Help her, now.

00:39.852 --> 00:40.911
Jesus.

00:40.921 --> 00:42.153
Kady!

00:45.025 --> 00:47.123
We've been... we've been
calling it the Truth Key,

00:47.134 --> 00:49.214
'cause it... well, it reveals truths.

00:49.225 --> 00:51.454
Mm, I can handle a little truth.

00:51.465 --> 00:52.875
Oh, hey, Penny.

00:53.699 --> 00:54.899
Wai...

00:59.739 --> 01:01.121
Hi.

01:01.741 --> 01:03.032
I was just leaving.

01:03.042 --> 01:04.632
Okay.

01:04.643 --> 01:07.077
Oh, hey, wait. I, um...

01:09.619 --> 01:11.445
Um...

01:11.456 --> 01:12.948
Um, don't talk shit on Penny.

01:12.959 --> 01:15.504
He's... he's here. He's coming with me.

01:16.340 --> 01:17.546
Oh. Okay.

01:17.557 --> 01:19.924
Um, hi, Penny.

01:21.159 --> 01:23.217
Right, sorry. Um...

01:23.227 --> 01:26.127
You heard about Brakebills, right?

01:27.002 --> 01:29.094
Well, it turns out, the Physical Cottage

01:29.519 --> 01:32.593
has been, like,
magically moved so many times

01:32.604 --> 01:34.922
that, uh, there's no valid deed on it,

01:34.933 --> 01:39.442
so, like, you can't sell something
that you don't own, so we can, um...

01:41.145 --> 01:43.071
Um, I'm sorry.

01:43.081 --> 01:45.853
I'm sor... sorry. I'm not
trying to make it weird.

01:45.864 --> 01:47.521
It's just weird now.

01:47.532 --> 01:49.792
It just is. It's just weird.

01:50.021 --> 01:51.779
Sorry.

01:51.789 --> 01:55.918
So I'm going to take the key so I can
see Penny, and I'll bring it back.

01:55.929 --> 01:57.003
Okay.

01:57.014 --> 01:59.615
- You guys have fun.
- Mm-hmm.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:10.107 --> 02:12.632
Sorry. I thought you went to rehab.

02:12.642 --> 02:15.368
Uh, this is where they stick you
when you don't have insurance.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.939
The upside?

02:19.016 --> 02:21.116
I'm the least crazy person in here.

02:23.436 --> 02:25.403
What do you want?

02:29.125 --> 02:30.282
Hold this.

02:30.292 --> 02:31.559
Why?

02:41.804 --> 02:44.696
Oh, my God!

02:44.706 --> 02:46.679
No. No, no, no, wait!

02:46.690 --> 02:48.634
You just need to hold this.

02:53.951 --> 02:55.376
Oh, my God.

03:01.657 --> 03:03.815
I'm Just gonna give you two a moment.

03:03.825 --> 03:06.018
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

03:11.332 --> 03:13.091
Look, I know it's weird,

03:13.101 --> 03:15.160
but at least I'm not stuck
in the fucking Underworld

03:15.170 --> 03:16.928
for a billion years.

03:16.938 --> 03:19.997
Why are you acting
like this is good news?

03:20.007 --> 03:21.899
Because...

03:21.909 --> 03:23.168
I'm not dead.

03:23.178 --> 03:25.903
Yeah, well, I almost was.

03:25.913 --> 03:28.873
Look... look at me. Look at where I am.

03:28.883 --> 03:30.208
I know.

03:30.218 --> 03:32.092
And I'm sorry.

03:32.103 --> 03:33.811
I tried to save you,

03:33.822 --> 03:35.344
and I failed,

03:35.355 --> 03:37.848
and it broke me,

03:37.858 --> 03:40.559
and now... now you're... you're...

03:41.629 --> 03:45.756
You're... you're what...
some kind of ghost?

03:45.766 --> 03:46.942
Astral projection.

03:46.953 --> 03:48.959
What's the fucking difference?

03:48.970 --> 03:50.694
I-I can't... I can't touch you.

03:50.704 --> 03:52.362
I can't even see you
without holding a key

03:52.372 --> 03:54.298
that makes me physically ill.

03:54.308 --> 03:56.066
I can't...

03:56.076 --> 03:58.495
I...

03:59.879 --> 04:02.372
Look, I'm here. That's all.

04:02.382 --> 04:04.274
God, when does this end?

04:04.284 --> 04:06.142
Let me help you.

04:09.055 --> 04:11.982
How are you gonna help me?

04:13.893 --> 04:16.285
You're the reason I'm in here, Penny.

04:16.295 --> 04:18.997
Don't you fucking get that?

04:20.934 --> 04:23.126
No, I have to put myself back together.

04:23.136 --> 04:24.927
- Yeah, but, Kady, I...
- No.

04:24.937 --> 04:27.396
If you say "I love you," I swear to God,

04:27.406 --> 04:29.631
I will find a way to kill you.

04:30.409 --> 04:33.076
At least then, this would be over.

04:47.626 --> 04:49.852
Whatever happens,

04:49.862 --> 04:53.355
remind me never to take
your advice again.

04:53.365 --> 04:55.598
Let's go.

04:58.270 --> 05:02.364
I'm sorry. You sent
Fen and Fray into the City?

05:02.374 --> 05:03.865
They're gonna get eaten alive.

05:03.875 --> 05:07.435
She is a knife maker's daughter.
She can handle herself.

05:07.445 --> 05:09.304
Besides, I sent them with Todd,

05:09.314 --> 05:11.939
so it's not like
I'm completely irresponsible.

05:11.949 --> 05:13.808
Look, if you really want
to talk about this

05:13.818 --> 05:16.277
instead of getting over Alice,
then we can, but...

05:16.287 --> 05:19.113
I'm sorry. Look...

05:19.123 --> 05:21.783
I know that it's all shitty
right now, but...

05:21.793 --> 05:24.285
At least we're doing
whatever we can to fix it.

05:24.295 --> 05:26.154
Right?

05:26.164 --> 05:28.822
And when we do, maybe Alice will act

05:28.832 --> 05:30.123
like someone I recognize.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.792
On the plus, you didn't exaggerate.

05:31.802 --> 05:34.127
This book is strangely compelling,

05:34.137 --> 05:35.996
yet incomplete.

05:36.006 --> 05:39.466
Yeah, it's a one-step-at-a-time quest.

05:39.476 --> 05:41.001
Um...

05:41.011 --> 05:44.004
Okay, so the chapter, right?

05:44.014 --> 05:46.206
It's about the Daughter's training

05:46.216 --> 05:47.741
to become a knight, right?

05:47.751 --> 05:49.375
And it is... it's sort of fascinating

05:49.385 --> 05:52.713
how it plays with the classic
trope of the hero's journey.

05:52.723 --> 05:55.415
Right. Cute. Where do we get the key?

05:55.425 --> 05:58.251
Um...

05:58.261 --> 05:59.485
Right here.

06:01.098 --> 06:02.154
Oh, yeah.

06:02.164 --> 06:04.724
- Familiar?
- Mm-hmm.

06:04.734 --> 06:05.925
It's the Mosaic.

06:05.935 --> 06:07.159
What's the Mosaic?

06:07.169 --> 06:09.429
The Mosaic.

06:09.439 --> 06:11.831
- The puzzle.
- Nope.

06:11.841 --> 06:13.499
It's...

06:13.509 --> 06:15.101
You use tiles...

06:15.111 --> 06:18.212
Are you kidding me? You use
the tiles to create a design

06:18.223 --> 06:20.172
that reflects the beauty of all life,

06:20.182 --> 06:22.374
and when you do,
there's a-a mystery prize.

06:22.384 --> 06:24.176
You've... really,
you've never heard of this?

06:24.186 --> 06:26.212
"The beauty of all life"?

06:26.222 --> 06:29.014
Sounds appropriately vague
and impossible.

06:29.024 --> 06:31.250
What's the prize?

06:31.260 --> 06:34.519
A so-called key to greater magic.

06:34.529 --> 06:36.388
Don't you love it when the metaphors

06:36.398 --> 06:38.523
turn out to be literal? Let's go.

06:38.533 --> 06:41.368
El, it's in Fillory.

06:43.438 --> 06:45.364
Psst!

06:45.374 --> 06:46.898
You look nervous.

06:48.543 --> 06:50.034
Why would I be nervous?

06:50.044 --> 06:51.770
I only collected a substance

06:51.780 --> 06:54.538
I must assume the fairy queen
would kill me for having...

06:54.548 --> 06:55.814
Shh.

06:55.825 --> 06:57.986
Ovary up, Tick.

06:58.629 --> 07:00.510
Let me see the jar.

07:02.757 --> 07:06.885
Having scraped from the very walls
she is violently allergic to.

07:06.895 --> 07:09.387
Nicely done. We need more.

07:09.397 --> 07:11.221
This took me seven hours.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.324
So seven more hours should be easy.

07:13.334 --> 07:15.926
We only get one shot
to slip this in her bath.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.061
High Queen Margo.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.497
Join me, won't you?

07:24.978 --> 07:29.106
All right. You want to tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.308
A leader as brave and cunning
as yourself

07:31.318 --> 07:35.578
knows that she needs alliances
in order to grow her kingdom.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.939
Does she?

07:37.752 --> 07:39.351
Consider this a wedding gift.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.095
Well, don't just stand there.

07:46.434 --> 07:49.302
You've got to get ready for your guests.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.871
Oh, fucking balls.

08:07.618 --> 08:10.446
On Earth, we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first,

08:10.456 --> 08:12.448
or at least know where they come from.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.050
Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.294
I mean, vaguely.

08:16.305 --> 08:18.520
I was told they're marauding
dickholes who steal stuff.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.557
Well, thanks to the loss of
magic, their mountain crashed

08:21.567 --> 08:24.326
and is now an island off your coast.

08:24.336 --> 08:26.462
Their army, however,

08:26.472 --> 08:29.865
numbers 4,000 spears.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.499
Marry into the tribe, it's yours.

08:33.345 --> 08:36.136
Look, somebody already tried to trick me

08:36.147 --> 08:38.639
into the whole
"alliance by wedding" thing.

08:38.649 --> 08:39.866
I passed.

08:39.878 --> 08:42.054
You had a choice back then.

08:43.154 --> 08:44.533
Being a queen

08:44.544 --> 08:47.521
means sacrificing for your people.

08:48.157 --> 08:49.433
Get used to it.

08:49.444 --> 08:52.186
Do you want to enlighten me
as to why you give a queef

08:52.197 --> 08:54.489
whether I marry
some mountain turd or not?

08:54.499 --> 08:56.391
No, I don't.

08:56.401 --> 08:57.525
High Queen Margo.

08:57.535 --> 08:59.193
Jesus.

08:59.203 --> 09:00.995
You scared me.

09:01.005 --> 09:02.329
Were you talking to someone?

09:02.339 --> 09:05.165
No, I just didn't expect
to see you there.

09:05.175 --> 09:07.001
True.

09:07.011 --> 09:10.037
Haven't seen you since...

09:10.047 --> 09:11.429
After our own little near-miss,

09:11.440 --> 09:14.144
I'm a little surprised to see you
running off to the altar so soon.

09:14.155 --> 09:15.675
I hear you there.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.544
I mean, The Floating Mountain?

09:17.554 --> 09:20.079
They don't have much
in the way of resources.

09:20.089 --> 09:22.916
They have a real big army.

09:22.926 --> 09:27.020
Well, whatever you plan on
doing with all that manpower,

09:27.030 --> 09:29.689
I certainly hope it doesn't put
us on opposite sides.

09:29.699 --> 09:33.059
High King Eliot and your dad
forged an alliance.

09:33.069 --> 09:34.628
Nothing's changed.

09:36.372 --> 09:38.398
Is this about the time that we banged

09:38.408 --> 09:41.267
and then I opted out of marrying you?

09:41.277 --> 09:43.937
Your insecurity is showing, babe.

09:43.947 --> 09:46.306
That was purely political.

09:46.316 --> 09:49.309
But if we'd had another round,

09:49.319 --> 09:52.211
I'm certain my charms
would lead you to reconsider...

09:52.221 --> 09:53.936
my queen.

09:53.947 --> 09:55.983
I look forward to our future talks.

10:03.732 --> 10:06.391
Your Queeniness, the groom's
wedding party has arrived,

10:06.401 --> 10:08.160
and taken it upon themselves

10:08.170 --> 10:12.597
to set up camp
in your very favorite hallway.

10:12.607 --> 10:15.633
I fear there is no way to
complete the task we discussed.

10:15.643 --> 10:18.603
Shit.

10:18.613 --> 10:21.106
We have to figure out another weapon.

10:21.116 --> 10:22.574
In the meantime,

10:22.584 --> 10:25.610
I need the fastest bunnies you got.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.580
So we know that this
is a portal to Fillory...

10:28.590 --> 10:30.147
or was.

10:30.157 --> 10:32.260
Um, so I figured, you know,
stick the key in...

10:32.271 --> 10:34.452
- Mm.
- Wind it, and...

10:34.462 --> 10:35.974
- Logical.
- Right.

10:35.985 --> 10:38.089
Except that there is not a...

10:38.100 --> 10:39.933
you know, there's no keyhole anywhere.

10:39.944 --> 10:41.730
- It's chain-wound.
- Huh?

10:41.741 --> 10:43.593
I took an elective in Horomancy.

10:43.604 --> 10:46.330
At castle. Getting married.

10:46.340 --> 10:48.765
Well, hello, there,
little plot development.

10:48.775 --> 10:50.767
At castle. Getting married.

10:50.777 --> 10:52.303
Does that sound like Margo to you?

10:53.481 --> 10:55.172
Need help now, dickwads.

10:55.182 --> 10:56.474
Definitely Bambi.

10:56.484 --> 10:58.442
Okay, we have to find a way
to get there.

10:58.452 --> 11:00.377
Um, uh, do you think that the key

11:00.387 --> 11:02.278
can create a portal to Fillory somehow?

11:02.288 --> 11:04.648
- Eliot, look.
- Oh.

11:04.658 --> 11:07.017
I guess this is my cue.

11:24.144 --> 11:25.635
Okay...

11:30.558 --> 11:31.674
Okay.

11:31.684 --> 11:34.510
Well, we should wait
and gather the troops, right?

11:36.822 --> 11:38.414
Go time.

11:38.424 --> 11:40.716
Guess this leg of the quest
is you and me.

11:45.230 --> 11:46.822
Okay.

11:54.406 --> 11:56.831
Okay, well, I hope that was
the right choice,

11:56.841 --> 11:59.642
'cause the portal just closed.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.837
Do you feel that?

12:02.847 --> 12:04.598
Yeah.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.209
Whoa.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.277
Oh, my God.

12:09.287 --> 12:10.412
Magic.

12:10.638 --> 12:13.347
- Magic. Ha!
- Eliot.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.191
- What?
- They...

12:16.194 --> 12:17.218
How is it back?

12:17.228 --> 12:20.288
It's not back.

12:20.298 --> 12:22.557
Um, is that...

12:22.567 --> 12:25.526
They're constructing the north spire.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.195
Which was built in, uh...

12:27.205 --> 12:28.796
Decades before the Chatwins arrived.

12:28.806 --> 12:30.571
We're...

12:31.709 --> 12:34.235
in Fillory in the past.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.681
Ah, shit.

12:40.614 --> 12:44.232
So, in the Fillory books, Jane, um,

12:44.242 --> 12:45.967
she decides to try the Mosaic, right?

12:45.977 --> 12:47.369
Uh, but she's too late.

12:47.379 --> 12:50.238
Someone had already solved it first.

12:50.248 --> 12:52.040
Who?

12:52.050 --> 12:54.275
Well, I don't know, but maybe it's us,

12:54.285 --> 12:55.728
and that's why we're here now.

12:55.739 --> 12:58.528
I don't know. Time travel
only really makes sense to me

12:58.539 --> 13:00.839
when I'm on a good deal of peyote.

13:08.733 --> 13:10.457
Yoo-hoo.

13:10.467 --> 13:12.660
Hiya.

13:17.141 --> 13:19.166
It's all yours...

13:19.176 --> 13:22.669
if you don't mind wasting
your gods-damn time.

13:26.316 --> 13:29.476
Oh. Well...

13:29.486 --> 13:32.612
auspicious signs abound.

13:34.157 --> 13:35.231
Ay.

13:39.020 --> 13:42.689
All right, so 784 tiles in 15 colors.

13:42.699 --> 13:45.759
Uh, so that's 784 factorial,

13:45.769 --> 13:48.074
- uh, divided by...
- Seriously?

13:48.085 --> 13:50.496
You're trying to calculate
the beauty of all life?

13:50.506 --> 13:53.466
Uh, well, I'm just trying
to see what we're in for.

13:53.476 --> 13:56.536
There's a finite set
of possible solutions, so...

13:56.546 --> 14:00.606
Um...

14:00.616 --> 14:03.142
Okay, yeah, that's a lot of zeroes.

14:03.152 --> 14:05.177
Um, how many zeroes?

14:05.187 --> 14:07.345
- Uh, to be exact?
- Yeah.

14:07.355 --> 14:08.905
A shitload.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.163
The mother of your
soon-to-be prince consort

14:13.174 --> 14:14.343
wishes to meet with you.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.163
Yeah, thanks. Not in the mood.

14:16.174 --> 14:19.324
May I present, from the Tribe
of The Floating Mountain.

14:19.334 --> 14:20.693
That Is No Longer Floating,

14:20.703 --> 14:23.295
Lady Agate Grey the Stone Queen?

14:23.305 --> 14:25.497
Greetings, High Queen Margo.

14:25.507 --> 14:28.166
Um, hey, Stone Queen.

14:28.176 --> 14:30.535
I'm actually glad you're here.

14:30.739 --> 14:34.900
I'd like to discuss
postponing the nuptials.

14:34.911 --> 14:37.853
Well, I was led to believe this
was a matter of some urgency.

14:37.864 --> 14:40.411
And who led you to believe that?

14:40.421 --> 14:43.081
A mutual royal friend.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.482
Very pale.

14:44.492 --> 14:47.518
Look, I'm sure your armies
are super great.

14:47.528 --> 14:48.536
It's just...

14:48.547 --> 14:50.187
My own wedding was so long ago,

14:50.197 --> 14:52.090
I forget how nervous a bride can be.

14:53.234 --> 14:54.725
Perhaps we forego superstition

14:54.735 --> 14:58.562
and let you meet my son
before the ceremony.

14:58.572 --> 15:00.864
Unless you think that's too forward?

15:00.874 --> 15:02.433
Fine.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.503
I'd love to meet the man I'm
gonna marry in a couple hours.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.122
Wonderful.

15:07.762 --> 15:09.552
Invite the rest in.

15:10.217 --> 15:12.876
Oh, stand up straight, darling.

15:12.886 --> 15:15.612
May I present Prince Fomar.

15:15.622 --> 15:17.180
Okay, no.

15:17.190 --> 15:20.383
Uh-huh. Too freaky, even for me.

15:20.393 --> 15:22.552
Oh, no, Your Highness, of course not.

15:22.562 --> 15:23.754
Fomar is far too young.

15:23.764 --> 15:24.995
Mother.

15:25.006 --> 15:28.425
A pebble's time will come, dear.

15:28.635 --> 15:30.893
Fomar will be your brother-in-law.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.220
Your betrothed...

15:36.142 --> 15:37.867
Prince Micah.

15:37.877 --> 15:40.260
Greetings, my queen.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.185
May our great mountain

15:45.196 --> 15:47.662
find its way
through your fertile valley.

15:51.557 --> 15:53.857
Hello, Prince Micah.

15:55.594 --> 15:57.452
Why don't you two take a moment

15:57.462 --> 16:00.263
to get to know each other... alone?

16:01.900 --> 16:04.100
Let's go. Come on.

16:07.439 --> 16:09.464
How can I make this right
for you, my queen?

16:09.474 --> 16:11.800
Are you one of those sick fuck princes

16:11.810 --> 16:13.602
who likes to shoot girls with arrows,

16:13.612 --> 16:16.572
or am I gonna wake up tomorrow
chained to a wall?

16:16.582 --> 16:19.941
If you are, I will free you,
if you command.

16:19.951 --> 16:21.776
You are a woman.

16:21.786 --> 16:23.945
Okay.

16:23.955 --> 16:28.282
Since you mention women, let's discuss.

16:28.292 --> 16:30.351
Our women are leaders.

16:30.361 --> 16:32.620
They are the cave, full of wisdom.

16:32.630 --> 16:35.523
Men are the boulder, full of strength.

16:35.533 --> 16:37.625
The spear with the boulder...

16:37.635 --> 16:38.959
Yeah, okay.

16:39.288 --> 16:40.780
I get the idea.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.015
So, matriarchy, huh?

16:45.376 --> 16:49.370
Society where women
hold the primary power.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.605
Is that not the way it is
everywhere, my queen?

16:53.516 --> 16:54.816
It is.

16:56.485 --> 17:00.646
I still don't understand why we
have to do this in the same room.

17:00.657 --> 17:04.726
It's a Floater custom, ma'am,
and it has its advantages.

17:26.482 --> 17:28.007
Oh, my queen.

17:29.886 --> 17:31.878
I am unharmed, and you?

17:31.888 --> 17:33.545
I'm good.

17:37.359 --> 17:40.024
Um, one sec, okay?

17:41.927 --> 17:44.310
Are you seriously accusing me
of trying to kill Micah?

17:44.321 --> 17:46.205
Why in Loria's name would I do that?

17:46.216 --> 17:49.865
I don't know. Why would you?

17:49.876 --> 17:51.543
You know, you didn't
seem all that excited

17:51.553 --> 17:53.713
about the wedding yourself
last time we talked.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.514
Are you suggesting I did it?

17:56.524 --> 17:58.449
Is your war council getting afraid

17:58.459 --> 18:00.518
of our alliance with the Floaters?

18:00.528 --> 18:02.420
You told me we had nothing to fear.

18:02.430 --> 18:05.015
And you told me you'd win me with charm.

18:05.026 --> 18:08.059
If I'd actually tried to kill
that walking jawline, he'd be dead.

18:08.069 --> 18:10.027
It's not the first time
you've waltzed in

18:10.037 --> 18:11.971
and tried to kill someone
to get your way.

18:11.989 --> 18:14.567
Spoken like someone who's
really starting to miss me.

18:14.578 --> 18:15.631
Honey...

18:16.443 --> 18:19.102
you ain't even top 50,

18:19.112 --> 18:23.393
and you ain't getting another
chance to kill my husband.

18:24.612 --> 18:26.030
Guards!

18:26.041 --> 18:27.977
Lock him up.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.612
And be a little rough about it.

18:43.469 --> 18:46.261
Yeah, they're still not moving, Q.

18:46.271 --> 18:49.065
Son of a...

18:49.075 --> 18:50.273
I checked...

18:51.611 --> 18:53.235
Look, I've checked the Circumstances,

18:53.245 --> 18:54.436
and the Slavic is perfect.

18:54.446 --> 18:55.738
It should work. I don't...

18:55.748 --> 18:58.074
Unless magic doesn't work on this.

18:58.084 --> 19:00.275
Great. Brought back to a time
when magic exists

19:00.285 --> 19:02.010
except on the one thing
that we need it to.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.412
Okay, okay, so... so what?

19:03.422 --> 19:06.081
We do it the old-fashioned way.
We're smart. We can do hard things.

19:06.091 --> 19:08.250
This is an impossible thing, Eliot.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.315
We have to show the beauty of all life.

19:10.326 --> 19:11.807
- The beauty of all life?
- Yeah.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.510
What does that mean, and how are
we supposed to show it with tiles?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.273
We're not gonna show it with
fucking math, Quentin!

19:16.284 --> 19:18.551
- This is the stupidest puzzle!
- No, no, no.

19:19.437 --> 19:21.696
- I...
- This is our quest.

19:21.706 --> 19:24.406
We have to do it ourselves.

19:28.312 --> 19:31.139
I'm not saying that it's not
going to take a while.

19:31.149 --> 19:34.642
Logic this with me for one second, okay?

19:36.120 --> 19:38.546
Jane came along too late, right?

19:38.556 --> 19:41.282
Someone came to the Mosaic and solved it

19:41.292 --> 19:42.617
before she even got here...

19:42.627 --> 19:44.619
gets here... will get here.

19:44.629 --> 19:47.221
You tried to convince me
that someone was us.

19:48.367 --> 19:50.556
Yeah, but I didn't think that
it was gonna take a decade.

19:50.567 --> 19:54.194
Well, in the absence of a better option,
let's... let's at least try, huh?

19:59.576 --> 20:01.135
Is Penny with you?

20:01.145 --> 20:03.137
He needed some time to himself.

20:03.147 --> 20:05.505
What are you doing?

20:05.515 --> 20:09.209
Uh, I've just been trying to figure
out this thing that Penny told me...

20:09.219 --> 20:11.411
uh, something that he saw
in the astral plane.

20:11.421 --> 20:14.714
These aren't magic. These are religion.

20:14.724 --> 20:16.383
Yeah.

20:16.393 --> 20:18.159
We're in that territory.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.826
Alice needs your help.

20:26.836 --> 20:28.327
Who are you?

20:34.543 --> 20:36.368
Help her, Julia.

20:42.384 --> 20:44.173
What the fuck?

20:48.390 --> 20:50.390
Okay.

20:52.094 --> 20:54.720
Let's go get a drink. Yeah?

21:05.107 --> 21:07.766
Everyone, gather around.

21:08.244 --> 21:11.536
Greetings, Fillorians, Floaters.

21:11.546 --> 21:14.247
We gather to join two great lands.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.754
High Queen Margo,

21:29.764 --> 21:31.622
do you take Micah

21:31.632 --> 21:34.625
of the Tribe of The Floating Mountain...

21:34.635 --> 21:36.761
That Is No Longer Floating

21:36.771 --> 21:38.395
to be yours,

21:38.405 --> 21:41.431
binding your houses together
for eternity?

21:41.441 --> 21:44.501
Oh, what the hell?

21:44.511 --> 21:46.177
Traditional Earth saying.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.640
Prince Micah,

21:49.650 --> 21:52.909
do you take Margo of the Tribe of Hanson

21:52.919 --> 21:54.578
to be yours,

21:54.588 --> 21:58.248
binding your houses together
for eternity?

21:58.258 --> 21:59.970
I do.

22:17.369 --> 22:20.452
When the rock crumbles in our hand,

22:20.463 --> 22:22.936
we must reach for the next.

22:23.299 --> 22:25.236
Pickwick, continue, per custom.

22:26.184 --> 22:27.509
What?

22:27.519 --> 22:29.477
Yes, yes, of course, you're right.

22:31.323 --> 22:33.385
What are you talking about?

22:34.659 --> 22:36.284
What custom?

22:36.294 --> 22:40.188
Uh, when tragedy befalls
a royal wedding,

22:40.198 --> 22:43.944
it is the solemn duty of the
surviving sibling to carry out...

22:43.955 --> 22:46.327
- What?
- It is my duty

22:46.337 --> 22:47.494
and honor

22:47.504 --> 22:49.964
to take the place of my...

22:49.974 --> 22:52.700
late brother.

22:52.710 --> 22:56.236
But he... he fucking killed him.

22:56.246 --> 22:59.707
- He murdered his own brother!
- That does not affect my duty.

23:02.353 --> 23:05.412
Are you people all crazy?

23:08.225 --> 23:10.483
Marry him...

23:10.493 --> 23:11.918
now.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.440
God damn it!

23:30.877 --> 23:32.368
I'm done.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.937
Okay.

23:33.947 --> 23:37.474
Just don't take it apart
until I write it down.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.383
Okay.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.387
God damn it.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.456
I'll write it down.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.058
Okay, yeah, so you just fill in...

23:56.068 --> 23:59.028
- fill that in with red.
- Oh, my God.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.896
You know, you're not going
to get very far

24:00.906 --> 24:03.132
if you're this frustrated after 14 days.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.199
How are you not?

24:04.209 --> 24:05.901
Oh, Q.

24:05.911 --> 24:07.903
You know the answer.

24:07.913 --> 24:11.206
<i>Can you imagine Margo
putting up with this tedium?</i>

24:11.216 --> 24:13.908
<i>No, not even a little.</i>

24:13.918 --> 24:16.311
<i>She'd have blown it up day two.</i>

24:16.321 --> 24:17.979
What is that, anyway?

24:17.989 --> 24:19.248
You know, not everything

24:19.258 --> 24:21.150
has to look like something, Eliot.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.218
Ah, it's the eternal argument.

24:23.228 --> 24:27.022
Realism versus abstract expressionism.

24:27.032 --> 24:28.589
Mm, okay.

24:28.599 --> 24:30.591
Green.

24:30.601 --> 24:31.926
Green.

24:31.936 --> 24:33.995
- Yeah.
- Yeah, green one.

24:34.005 --> 24:35.329
There.

24:35.339 --> 24:36.597
No, no, there.

24:36.607 --> 24:38.033
- There?
- No.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.183
There.

24:39.194 --> 24:41.087
Just kidding. You had it right
the first time.

24:41.098 --> 24:43.171
You know what? I'll tell you
where I'll put this.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.505
Yeah? Come at me, Coldwater.

24:44.515 --> 24:47.341
Peaches? Plums?

24:47.351 --> 24:48.376
Arielle.

24:48.386 --> 24:49.443
I'm Eliot.

24:49.453 --> 24:52.046
- This is my friend, Quentin.
- Hi, there.

24:52.056 --> 24:53.214
Hi.

24:53.224 --> 24:55.349
Oh, this is my helper, Lunk.

24:59.963 --> 25:01.521
Happy anniversary, Q.

25:01.531 --> 25:04.558
To our first and last year
at this thing.

25:11.274 --> 25:13.133
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:13.143 --> 25:14.467
I, um...

25:19.482 --> 25:21.107
Um, so...

25:21.117 --> 25:22.309
Yeah.

25:22.319 --> 25:24.977
Um...

25:24.987 --> 25:27.214
let's just save our overthinking

25:27.224 --> 25:29.949
for the puzzle, yeah?

25:29.959 --> 25:31.318
Yeah.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.524
We could be done tomorrow
for all you know.

25:43.305 --> 25:45.564
We can't just throw away
all this time we've invested.

25:45.574 --> 25:48.467
You want to live your life,
live it here.

25:48.477 --> 25:50.068
What is that supposed to mean?

25:50.078 --> 25:52.170
You know exactly what that means.

25:57.986 --> 25:59.511
Oops.

25:59.521 --> 26:02.414
I don't know. It's just...

26:04.159 --> 26:06.618
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:08.196 --> 26:09.687
No Lunk today?

26:09.697 --> 26:12.523
Found him holding
someone else's peaches.

26:14.702 --> 26:18.263
Sorry, I, um...

26:18.273 --> 26:20.598
I mean, I always thought you
were too good for him anyway.

27:10.089 --> 27:11.682
Come visit soon.

27:11.692 --> 27:13.049
Of course.

27:14.114 --> 27:15.718
- If we're not here...
- I know, Dad.

27:18.198 --> 27:19.722
I love you, too.

27:33.346 --> 27:35.604
You ever think about them?

27:35.614 --> 27:36.672
My grandkids?

27:36.682 --> 27:40.042
No, um...

27:40.052 --> 27:41.243
our friends...

27:43.356 --> 27:45.047
Uh, from our lives before.

27:47.559 --> 27:49.417
I dream about them sometimes.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.302
Eliot...

29:31.725 --> 29:33.651
Did you just solve the Mosaic?

29:39.700 --> 29:41.392
With a friend.

29:43.704 --> 29:46.397
We solved it together.

29:46.407 --> 29:47.798
Well, this is dreadful!

29:47.808 --> 29:49.633
You see...

29:49.643 --> 29:51.702
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude.

29:51.712 --> 29:54.572
- My name is...
- Jane Chatwin.

29:54.582 --> 29:56.406
Do I know you?

29:56.416 --> 29:57.741
You do look...

29:57.751 --> 29:59.710
Ah, just one of those faces.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.411
The dwarves...

30:01.421 --> 30:04.581
They built me this watch.

30:04.591 --> 30:07.384
It's terribly important.

30:07.394 --> 30:09.594
I need that key to power it.

30:12.265 --> 30:14.757
It sort of took us a while to, um...

30:14.767 --> 30:16.593
It's just...

30:16.603 --> 30:18.761
My brother, he's...

30:18.771 --> 30:20.597
he's become dangerous,

30:20.607 --> 30:22.765
and I'm trying to stop him.

30:22.775 --> 30:24.433
The dwarves told me

30:24.443 --> 30:26.836
if everything gets
too buggered up to fix,

30:26.846 --> 30:28.671
I could use this watch.

30:28.681 --> 30:31.674
To create time loops.

30:31.684 --> 30:34.443
You need the key to stop The Beast.

30:34.453 --> 30:36.153
What's The Beast?

30:37.856 --> 30:40.357
Unfortunately, you'll find out.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.871
You have to take it.

30:56.608 --> 30:58.675
Here.

31:02.614 --> 31:04.305
Thank you.

31:34.950 --> 31:36.383
My queen,

31:36.828 --> 31:38.377
time to complete our marriage.

31:38.387 --> 31:41.414
We must become one flesh.

31:41.424 --> 31:43.216
- Right?
- I told you...

31:43.226 --> 31:44.950
it's Earth tradition.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.252
But must you really open every present

31:47.262 --> 31:48.921
before we can consummate?

31:48.931 --> 31:51.424
Well, if I don't...

31:51.434 --> 31:54.993
your manhood will rot and drop off

31:55.003 --> 31:57.262
like an overripe banana.

31:57.272 --> 31:59.064
Better not to chance it.

31:59.074 --> 32:00.464
Don't wait up.

32:22.864 --> 32:24.789
<i>So I arranged for this to be delivered</i>

32:24.799 --> 32:26.858
<i>the day of your wedding,</i>

32:26.868 --> 32:29.138
<i>way, way in advance.</i>

32:29.149 --> 32:32.129
<i>Long story. Anyway, I hope you're okay.</i>

32:32.139 --> 32:34.431
<i>No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.</i>

32:34.441 --> 32:37.701
<i>Eliot and I are both dead.</i>

32:37.711 --> 32:39.803
<i>Uh, the quest sent us</i>

32:39.813 --> 32:41.705
<i>to the past...
again, super-long story...</i>

32:41.715 --> 32:47.011
<i>and you should know
that we led full, good lives,</i>

32:47.021 --> 32:51.482
<i>and we took the quest
as far as we could, and...</i>

32:51.492 --> 32:54.117
<i>now there's something
that we need you to do.</i>

33:05.873 --> 33:08.365
Hello, Margo.

33:08.375 --> 33:10.133
Hi.

33:10.143 --> 33:11.401
Didn't you die?

33:11.411 --> 33:13.370
On the linear plane, yes.

33:13.380 --> 33:15.372
Not here, in the Clock Barrens.

33:15.382 --> 33:17.007
Right.

33:17.017 --> 33:20.010
So some kind of timey-wimey
magic going on here.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.145
Time loops are not my only trick.

33:22.155 --> 33:23.746
Here I managed to create a spot

33:23.756 --> 33:25.515
where all moments exist
at the same time,

33:25.525 --> 33:27.817
overlapping.

33:27.827 --> 33:29.351
So, even if you're dead...

33:29.361 --> 33:31.053
You're alive here.

33:31.063 --> 33:33.088
And dead, too, I suppose.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.024
This is a place outside of time.

33:35.034 --> 33:38.404
Well, I got a note from Quentin.
He told me you could give me a key.

33:38.415 --> 33:39.828
Yes.

33:39.838 --> 33:42.231
The key is here,
but I can't give it to you.

33:42.241 --> 33:44.233
It's what keeps
the Clock Barrens stable.

33:44.243 --> 33:46.005
That said, I would like
to help you, Margo.

33:46.016 --> 33:48.870
I don't need help. I need the key.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.206
Now, I'm sorry, but I've had
a bad couple of days,

33:51.216 --> 33:53.042
and my best friends are dead,

33:53.052 --> 33:56.277
and, frankly, I wish I had
your magic, or any magic,

33:56.287 --> 33:58.413
'cause I'd like to build
my own Clock Barrens

33:58.423 --> 34:01.917
right about now and just live there

34:01.927 --> 34:04.886
for, like, five minutes
without anyone trying to usurp

34:04.896 --> 34:07.055
or marry or educate or hump me.

34:07.065 --> 34:09.858
It is exhausting.

34:09.868 --> 34:12.927
You're going to be
a very, very powerful magician

34:12.937 --> 34:14.395
and queen.

34:14.405 --> 34:17.898
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

34:17.908 --> 34:20.268
Eliot and Quentin
make all the real moves.

34:20.277 --> 34:22.902
I'm more of a Fillorian middle manager.

34:22.913 --> 34:25.039
I know how that feels.

34:25.049 --> 34:26.940
Sometimes like you're
a supporting player

34:26.951 --> 34:28.909
in somebody else's story.

34:28.918 --> 34:31.210
Your tale is your own, Margo.

34:31.221 --> 34:32.411
You may not get

34:32.422 --> 34:34.246
the appreciation you deserve, frankly,

34:34.257 --> 34:36.049
or the peace,

34:36.059 --> 34:37.551
but it is yours,

34:37.561 --> 34:40.087
and I can tell you, it won't be boring.

34:42.399 --> 34:44.091
Thank you.

34:44.101 --> 34:46.126
Now, as to how I can help...

34:46.136 --> 34:47.827
out there in the linear plane,

34:47.837 --> 34:49.562
the key rests on my body at Brakebills.

34:49.572 --> 34:51.465
I can send you there, no problem.

34:51.475 --> 34:53.433
You're telling me to dig up your corpse.

34:53.443 --> 34:55.268
How the hell can you be
so chipper about it?

34:55.277 --> 34:57.237
Eh, hasn't happened yet.

34:57.247 --> 34:59.939
And I'm very English.

34:59.949 --> 35:02.942
It's been so good to chat to you, Margo.

35:02.952 --> 35:04.944
Ready to go?

35:04.954 --> 35:06.078
Yeah.

35:07.956 --> 35:09.982
I guess this is my cue.

35:14.096 --> 35:15.988
Wait!

35:15.998 --> 35:17.623
You bitches looking for these?

35:21.470 --> 35:23.929
Fuck.

35:23.939 --> 35:26.189
That entrance line was
the only thing keeping me going

35:26.200 --> 35:27.966
through six feet of dirt and corpse.

35:27.976 --> 35:29.535
Bambi. Hey.

35:29.545 --> 35:32.378
And I swore I wouldn't do this.

35:36.317 --> 35:37.643
Wow.

35:37.653 --> 35:39.645
I mean, I can't believe we died.

35:39.655 --> 35:42.047
- Sort of weird.
- Sad, right?

35:42.057 --> 35:43.448
But we didn't die.

35:43.458 --> 35:44.949
It was an alternate timeline

35:44.959 --> 35:47.218
and one that we never have to live now.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.054
Margo, you saved our lives.

35:49.064 --> 35:53.058
In addition to robbing
the cradle and a grave.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.527
I'll never get that smell
out of my hair.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.998
I mean, I know who I was.

36:01.008 --> 36:02.967
I was Alice Quinn.

36:02.977 --> 36:05.235
I was the best at something,

36:05.245 --> 36:06.904
at magic,

36:06.914 --> 36:09.974
but then magic took over,
and I lost Alice,

36:09.984 --> 36:12.076
and by the time I got her back,
I lost magic.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.178
Okay, so how can I help?

36:14.188 --> 36:18.348
I could use magic, and you have it.

36:18.358 --> 36:20.584
- Why do you have it?
- Mm.

36:20.594 --> 36:22.386
Prevailing theory?

36:22.396 --> 36:25.389
Extra sprinkles on the cupcake
from when Our Lady Underground

36:25.399 --> 36:28.425
restored my Shade, but...

36:28.435 --> 36:31.227
she didn't exactly leave a note, so...

36:31.237 --> 36:33.329
So you don't know.

36:33.339 --> 36:35.665
I mean, do I want to know?

36:35.675 --> 36:37.233
Yes.

36:37.243 --> 36:39.235
I mean, if you want to understand it,

36:39.245 --> 36:42.072
you need to know.

36:42.082 --> 36:45.508
Hey, all magic has a provenance.

36:48.053 --> 36:50.679
Uh, there was this machine
that the professors would use.

36:50.689 --> 36:54.383
Yeah, Q showed it to me,
but it doesn't work anymore.

36:54.393 --> 36:57.220
Right, of course not.

36:59.232 --> 37:01.524
What about the key?

37:01.534 --> 37:03.225
It shows the truth of things, right?

37:03.235 --> 37:05.193
Have you tried using that?

37:05.203 --> 37:07.195
I've held it.

37:11.309 --> 37:13.568
Maybe a mirror could help you focus it.

37:19.051 --> 37:20.542
Yeah, okay.

37:33.965 --> 37:35.457
What?

37:37.601 --> 37:39.913
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.605
Have a seat, Julia.

37:51.615 --> 37:54.183
It's time for us to talk.

37:58.170 --> 37:59.671
What did you do to me?

38:00.474 --> 38:02.398
I planted a seed for you to grow.

38:02.408 --> 38:05.635
Without telling me or asking me?

38:05.645 --> 38:08.772
I've tried to guide you
as gently as I could.

38:08.782 --> 38:10.640
I saw his eyes.

38:10.650 --> 38:13.584
I saw Reynard's eyes.

38:15.388 --> 38:17.613
Because the seed comes from him.

38:17.623 --> 38:19.114
Are you kidding me?

38:19.124 --> 38:20.783
I took it from him and gave it to you,

38:20.793 --> 38:24.453
and when you showed mercy,
you earned this.

38:24.463 --> 38:26.054
You didn't think before shoving

38:26.064 --> 38:29.366
some rapist's seed inside me to ask?

38:30.670 --> 38:32.295
You gods are real shaky

38:32.305 --> 38:34.129
on the concept of consent,
you know that?

38:34.139 --> 38:36.665
It doesn't matter where it comes from.

38:36.675 --> 38:39.268
It matters what you do with it.

38:39.278 --> 38:42.070
I don't want it.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.072
I don't accept it.

38:44.082 --> 38:46.809
Do you think the chosen
want to be chosen?

38:46.819 --> 38:49.778
I don't want a molecule of his power.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.721
It's not his anymore.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.316
It's yours.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.158
This might sound horrible,

39:04.168 --> 39:05.493
but he's gone.

39:05.503 --> 39:07.462
Does it matter where it came from?

39:07.472 --> 39:09.663
It's magic.

39:09.673 --> 39:11.165
You sound like her.

39:11.175 --> 39:13.835
Yeah, well, maybe she's right.

39:13.845 --> 39:16.770
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.673
I'd do anything to get it back.

39:19.683 --> 39:22.443
If I could give it to you, I would.

39:29.693 --> 39:31.760
What if you could?

39:37.534 --> 39:39.360
Kady, have a seat, please.

39:39.370 --> 39:42.863
Actually, I need to sign out.

39:42.873 --> 39:44.831
Yes, well, let's talk about that.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.734
No offense, but we just did.

39:47.744 --> 39:50.170
So, if there's something
for me to sign or...

39:50.180 --> 39:53.206
Kady, you are a danger
to yourself and to others.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.141
<i>You say "I love you,"</i>

39:55.151 --> 39:57.697
<i>I swear to God,
I will find a way to kill you.</i>

39:57.708 --> 40:00.212
<i>At least then, this would be over.</i>

40:00.738 --> 40:03.231
So who do you think you're talking to?

40:03.242 --> 40:04.484
Who did you want to kill?

40:04.494 --> 40:08.220
This is not something you'll understand.

40:08.230 --> 40:10.857
Kady, we're going to give you
a light sedative.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.429
Bob...

40:12.777 --> 40:14.310
move.

40:16.171 --> 40:17.204
Kady!

40:18.240 --> 40:19.899
Code gray.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.175
No, no, no!

40:30.185 --> 40:31.410
No, God damn it!

40:31.420 --> 40:32.511
You can't do this!

40:32.521 --> 40:33.572
No!

40:36.925 --> 40:38.517
Well...

40:38.527 --> 40:41.920
you guys got to loop
out of your shitty past.

40:41.930 --> 40:44.790
Looks like I'm stuck with mine.

40:44.800 --> 40:49.693
We are not leaving you alone with this.

40:49.703 --> 40:52.696
There's the old ball and chain now.

40:52.706 --> 40:54.232
I better catch some rest

40:54.242 --> 40:56.267
before he wakes up with a boner

40:56.277 --> 40:58.644
and some bad, bad ideas.

41:44.290 --> 41:46.649
- Déjà vu.
- Peaches and...

41:46.659 --> 41:48.518
- Peaches and plums.
- Peaches and plums.

41:48.528 --> 41:50.687
Peaches and plums. Peaches and plums.

41:54.867 --> 41:58.361
I got so old.

42:01.339 --> 42:02.597
You died.

42:07.678 --> 42:09.471
I died.

42:13.018 --> 42:15.443
You had a wife.

42:20.290 --> 42:22.850
And we had a family.

42:22.860 --> 42:25.686
How... how...

42:25.696 --> 42:28.890
how do we remember that?

42:28.900 --> 42:31.626
I don't know.
