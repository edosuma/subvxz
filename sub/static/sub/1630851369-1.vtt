WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:04.569
.

00:04.613 --> 00:07.181
- Tell me it's not a game.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.530
- Hey, take it easy.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.401
- You've got more lies.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.012
- Hey, over here.
Over here.

00:13.752 --> 00:14.579
[gunshot]

00:18.496 --> 00:21.195
- I'd like to name you
interim chief.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.413
- I'd be honored.

00:23.632 --> 00:27.114
- When I was 16,
I got pregnant.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.463
- It wasn't difficult for me
to find out

00:28.506 --> 00:29.681
you're my birth mother.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.683
I don't want anyone
to know about us.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.077
- They won't.

00:34.121 --> 00:38.168
- My mom was so sick, I stole
meds from Will's trial.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.517
- I have a lot of history
with Natalie.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.258
I won't apologize for it.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.522
- Did you tell her
you took them?

00:45.741 --> 00:47.656
- You're fired, Dr. Halstead.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.267
- I had to.

00:51.573 --> 00:54.054
- I was the one who sold
the trial meds for my mom.

01:00.190 --> 01:03.150
[somber music]

01:03.193 --> 01:10.461
â™ª

01:15.553 --> 01:18.295
- I guess that's everything.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.734
I'm going to be okay.

01:22.778 --> 01:26.086
- I know.
- You?

01:26.129 --> 01:27.870
- Yeah.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.744
- You need to go back.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.833
Please, call her.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.488
- Yeah.

01:51.937 --> 01:56.420
Hey, you better keep in touch.
All right, I'll come find you.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.422
- Take care of yourself.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.816
- Yeah, you too.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.472
Bye, Natalie.

02:23.795 --> 02:26.581
- I look at that spot
every day, too.

02:26.624 --> 02:30.759
So I understand Ethan's
physical therapy is going well.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.195
- That's what he says, yeah.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.676
- Oh, you're in contact,
that's good.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.895
Glad he didn't
hold a grudge.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.636
- A grudge?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.160
- Well, come on,
you're telling me

02:40.203 --> 02:41.857
that you don't think
about that?

02:41.900 --> 02:45.208
The shooter? Neil?
What's his name?

02:45.252 --> 02:46.470
If he'd been
put on psych hold...

02:46.514 --> 02:48.951
- What?
Ethan wouldn't have been shot?

02:48.994 --> 02:51.214
No. You know what?
I never think about that.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.825
Not even for a second.
What I do wonder about, though,

02:53.869 --> 02:55.523
is if any of this
would have happened

02:55.566 --> 02:57.742
if you hadn't taken the guy's
appendix out against his will.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.440
That's what I wonder about.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.616
I mean, come on,
he was aiming at you, right?

03:09.624 --> 03:12.670
- Sinus tachycardia at 120.
Sats at 90. Let's go!

03:12.714 --> 03:14.890
- Okay, let's get her to CT.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.198
- Dr. Cooper.
- Hello.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.764
- What happened
with your patient?

03:19.808 --> 03:21.331
- It looks like
pulmonary embolism.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.333
- But no DVT?
- No.

03:23.377 --> 03:24.682
- So is this due

03:24.726 --> 03:27.555
to the insertion
of the cardiac output monitor?

03:27.598 --> 03:30.297
- I wouldn't think so.
The Vas-COM is a good device.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.342
Rarely have any problems.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.476
Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.695
[phone chiming]

03:40.394 --> 03:43.266
Dr. Halstead.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.876
- Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.531
- We've got an open
radial fracture.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.707
I need you in five right now.
- Yeah.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.536
- I can't get a straight story
out of him.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.711
- We'll figure it out.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.931
I want you to go get
something to eat.

03:55.974 --> 03:58.716
All right, now,
your dad's out of the room.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.414
You gonna tell me
what really happened?

04:04.331 --> 04:05.810
Those there
are puncture wounds.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.508
That's a snakebite.
And I gotta know

04:07.551 --> 04:10.554
what kind of snake
so I can take care of you.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.426
- I'm gonna be sick.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.517
- You're gonna be a lot sicker

04:16.560 --> 04:18.258
unless you tell me
what kind of snake.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.653
- Rattlesnake.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.874
- Mix 5 vials of antivenom
with 250 ml of NS.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.354
- Right.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.878
- So how'd you meet up
with this rattlesnake?

04:31.967 --> 04:33.751
- I stuck my hand in a box.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.580
- I'm guessing the snake
was in that box?

04:36.624 --> 04:38.060
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.497
So why the Wild, Wild West?

04:40.541 --> 04:41.890
- Huh?

04:41.933 --> 04:44.719
- Ambo picked you up
on Chicago and Pulaski.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.634
You don't live over there.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.767
Your shoelaces tipped
in yellow and black.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.987
Those are gang colors.
The 66 boys.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.597
- What are you, a cop?

04:53.641 --> 04:57.340
- I used to be.
But now I'm a doc. So come on.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.083
- I was with some dudes.
- Uh-huh.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.607
Dudes your daddy
don't approve of?

05:03.651 --> 05:05.174
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.698
All right, so sticking your
hand in a box with a snake,

05:07.742 --> 05:10.658
was that some kind of
gang initiation or something,

05:10.701 --> 05:12.703
to see if shorty's
got what it takes?

05:14.139 --> 05:17.708
Yeah.
Hey, who's got that snake?

05:22.496 --> 05:23.975
Hook him up.
I'll be right there.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.500
Maggie, could you
do me a favor?

05:26.543 --> 05:29.677
Call CPD, 23rd District.
Ask for Lieutenant Scott.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.374
- Scott?
- Yeah, my dad.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.376
Tell him I need him to send one
of his guys and animal control

05:33.420 --> 05:34.943
to pick up a rattlesnake.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.075
Yeah, a rattlesnake.
I'll text you the address.

05:40.383 --> 05:44.692
- I want to come back to Med.
It's where I belong.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.825
You know I didn't steal
the trial meds--

05:47.869 --> 05:51.786
- Skip it. Are you familiar
with the Vas-COM?

05:51.829 --> 05:53.091
- The Vas-COM?

05:53.135 --> 05:57.400
- Cardiac output monitor
made by Vasik Labs.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.011
- Yeah, no, I know it.
It's pricey.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.666
Other monitors
are just as good.

06:02.710 --> 06:03.972
What about it?

06:04.015 --> 06:07.802
- We're billing Medicare
for its use 60% more

06:07.845 --> 06:10.848
than any other hospital
in the area.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.023
- Okay?

06:12.067 --> 06:14.678
- Well, if it's being
used unnecessarily

06:14.722 --> 06:17.159
and Medicare's being billed,
that's fraud.

06:17.202 --> 06:20.467
And it's an invasive procedure.

06:20.510 --> 06:23.687
So it's also
putting people at risk.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.907
- Ms. Goodwin, I-I just came
to ask for my job back--

06:25.950 --> 06:28.518
- And I heard you.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.913
Dr. Cooper, Matt Cooper,

06:31.956 --> 06:34.481
you have a relationship
with him.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.830
- Barely.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.789
I mean, he dated my cousin
Moira back in the day.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.618
- Well, Dr. Cooper is our
biggest booster of the Vas-COM.

06:41.662 --> 06:45.187
And I suspect it's because
he's getting kickbacks.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.102
Now, I could go to the board,

06:47.145 --> 06:49.060
but his father-in-law
sits on it.

06:49.104 --> 06:52.934
So I need something solid,
an admission of wrongdoing,

06:52.977 --> 06:54.631
preferably on tape.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.590
And you're going
to get it for me.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.593
- Hold on. Wait.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.422
You're saying you want me
to be your spy?

07:02.465 --> 07:04.075
- If that's what
you want to call it.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.209
But if you want to come back
here and practice medicine,

07:07.252 --> 07:08.732
that's what you're
going to have to do.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.168
- I don't believe this.
You're serious?

07:10.212 --> 07:11.866
- As a heart attack.

07:11.909 --> 07:14.477
Look, I have a doctor
in my hospital

07:14.521 --> 07:18.916
who's scamming the system
and putting patients at risk.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.092
I'll do whatever it takes
to stop him.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.878
Now, are you in or out?

07:28.230 --> 07:32.234
[dramatic music]

07:39.197 --> 07:41.373
I know he's been missed.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.201
- Yay, Dr. Halstead!
- Yeah!

07:43.245 --> 07:44.986
- Whoo-hoo!

07:45.029 --> 07:48.511
- And there are a couple
of folks that you haven't met.

07:48.555 --> 07:52.384
Dr. Dylan Scott,
and Dr. Stevie Hammer.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.995
- I know Dr. Hammer.

07:54.038 --> 07:56.258
- We were in med school
together.

07:56.301 --> 08:01.306
- Oh, okay. Nice.
All right, thank you, everyone.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.484
- All right, everyone,
we've got patients to see.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.227
- Hey, don't get me wrong,
I'm thrilled to see Will again,

08:09.271 --> 08:12.274
but I thought that
you weren't inviting him back.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.581
- I'll tell you about it later.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.324
- So I heard your clinical
trial was a rousing success.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.327
- I'm touched. You still care
enough to track my failures.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.505
What brought you back
to Chicago?

08:25.548 --> 08:28.029
- Home sweet home.
What made you stay?

08:28.072 --> 08:29.421
- Same.

08:29.465 --> 08:30.553
Look forward
to working with you.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.468
- Likewise.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.167
- What's up with you and her?

08:36.211 --> 08:38.300
- The Hammer?
- Uh-huh.

08:38.343 --> 08:41.085
- God. Never lets you forget
she was first in our class.

08:41.129 --> 08:46.003
- Ah, and you were second? No.

08:46.047 --> 08:49.224
I'm glad you're back.
Natalie would be happy.

08:49.267 --> 08:53.141
- Natalie and April gone.
Ethan in rehab.

08:53.184 --> 08:56.144
- Get back to work.
Treatment six.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.928
Twisted ankle.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.583
It's good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.585
[alarm blares]
- What do we got?

09:02.629 --> 09:05.457
- Lois Durant. 65, fatigued
and short of breath.

09:05.501 --> 09:06.676
- Hey, Lois. I'm Dr. Marcel.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.548
I'm going to be
taking care of you, okay?

09:08.591 --> 09:11.333
- BP 95/100. Heart Rate 115.

09:11.376 --> 09:14.597
- Been here before.
Lots of times.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.730
- Okay. Maggie, can we get
Ms. Durant's chart, please?

09:16.773 --> 09:18.166
- You got it.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.213
- Okay, folks,
we know what this is.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.432
Nice and easy.

09:23.475 --> 09:27.218
On my count, all right?
One, two, three.

09:29.351 --> 09:30.657
- Where's my doctor?

09:30.700 --> 09:33.050
- Lois, I'm your doctor, okay?

09:33.094 --> 09:35.618
Can you come forward
for me a little bit?

09:35.662 --> 09:38.316
There you go. Nice and easy.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.493
Yeah, lungs are wet.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.365
All right, there you go now.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.197
And I'm hearing
a systolic murmur.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.460
Have you had
that problem before?

09:51.503 --> 09:53.418
It's okay.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.988
Yeah, you're retaining fluids.

09:58.032 --> 10:00.034
Let's set up
for a bedside echo.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.165
- Okay.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.732
- Call my doctor.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.735
- Okay. Well, let's have a look
at your chart, all right?

10:09.609 --> 10:10.610
What?

10:12.699 --> 10:14.396
Hey, Maggie.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.180
- Yeah.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.834
- Hey, where's Ms. Durant's
chart?

10:17.878 --> 10:21.011
- We don't have it. She's one
of the Kender trial patients.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.491
- So?

10:22.534 --> 10:24.101
- Well, when Kender
pulled the trial,

10:24.145 --> 10:26.321
thanks to Dr. Halstead,
they took all the records.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.540
- And now they won't
release them.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.673
- Okay. Well, it looks like
she's in heart failure.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.370
So I'll need her history.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.676
- Well, you're in luck.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.547
The aforementioned
Dr. Halstead is in the house.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.681
I'm sure he'd be happy to share
his knowledge of the patient.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.553
- [sighs] Perfect.
- Yeah.

10:41.597 --> 10:44.687
- Halstead, I could use
your help in three.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.259
Hey, Lois, you remember
Dr. Halstead?

10:51.302 --> 10:53.653
- There's my doctor.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.090
- Lois, what happened?

10:56.133 --> 10:58.222
You were doing so good
a few months ago.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.354
- Don't...know.

10:59.397 --> 11:02.139
- Lois, can you lay back
for me?

11:02.183 --> 11:04.359
There you go.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.839
- How's your son?
Terence, right?

11:05.882 --> 11:07.449
Did he finish law school?

11:07.492 --> 11:11.453
- You remember.
- Sure.

11:11.496 --> 11:15.675
- Yeah, I'm seeing severe
mitral valve regurgitation.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.373
- Yeah, Ventricular pressure's
really low.

11:18.416 --> 11:22.725
- Yeah. Let's give Lois
morphine 5mg IV.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.422
That'll help dilate
your blood vessels,

11:24.466 --> 11:26.468
make it easier
for your heart to pump.

11:26.511 --> 11:30.167
And 40 of Lasix IV, please.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.343
It'll get rid
of some of the fluid.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.824
- We'll check back,
see how you're doing.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.698
- This makes no sense.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.439
Lois only had mild
regurgitation six months ago,

11:41.483 --> 11:44.442
and she was doing better
on the trial meds.

11:44.486 --> 11:47.184
Oh, man, I think we're looking
at hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.534
- Well, can't really tell
from the echo windows.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.319
But morphine should work.

11:54.148 --> 11:57.717
- Well, I hope you were able
to assist Dr. Marcel.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.327
- I remember the patient.
- Yeah.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.677
Got to tell you, it wasn't
my idea to bring you back.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.375
- Thanks, Dean.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.595
And, hey, congratulations
on being made Chief.

12:06.638 --> 12:10.512
I mean, it's what you
wanted all along, wasn't it?

12:10.555 --> 12:12.514
- Dr. Archer.

12:12.557 --> 12:16.213
- Thank you. Looking forward
to your next train wreck.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.174
- Ow!
- Hey, Ms. Brooks.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.436
I'm Dr. Archer.
- Hey.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.916
- I'm Emma. Gemma's sister.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.788
- Gemma and Emma.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.356
Dr. Taylor,
why isn't Gemma gowned?

12:28.399 --> 12:30.575
- She refused unless her sister
was also gowned.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.447
- We always dress alike.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.319
- Uh-huh. May I?
- Mm-hmm. Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:35.363 --> 12:36.799
- Okay.
So I understand

12:36.843 --> 12:38.801
that you're suffering from
abdominal pain and bloating?

12:38.845 --> 12:40.629
- Really bad.
- Okay.

12:40.672 --> 12:44.807
Well, I can help with that.
Start an IV hydromorphone .5mg.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.288
- Can you put a needle
in my arm, too?

12:47.331 --> 12:49.203
- I'm sorry, you said what?

12:49.246 --> 12:51.379
- Oh, we'd like a needle
in my arm, too.

12:53.773 --> 12:58.516
- I'm sorry, no,
I can't do that.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.302
- Both sisters were born
with only one ovary.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.783
And Gemma has a history
of ovarian cysts.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.610
- Which is not
necessarily problematic.

13:05.654 --> 13:09.484
I do need to check
your belly with ultrasound.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.878
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.490
- Okay, I'm going to
raise your blouse.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.927
If you could lower
your jeans for me.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.322
- It's going to be
a little cold.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.845
Okay, here we go.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.587
- [whimpering]

13:26.893 --> 13:28.633
- Okay. Yeah.
I see free fluid,

13:28.677 --> 13:31.767
which indicates an ovarian
cyst has likely burst.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.856
I'm going to do more
imaging to confirm.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.380
And I'm going to track
your hemoglobin.

13:36.424 --> 13:39.862
Now, if your blood count drops,
you will need surgery,

13:39.906 --> 13:42.256
and we may have to
remove your ovary.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.997
- Then you'll have to
take mine out, too.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.346
- I'm sorry?

13:45.389 --> 13:46.913
- We're identical.
- In every way.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.871
- Well, we just want
to make sure we know

13:48.915 --> 13:50.830
what we're dealing with here.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.832
Dr. Taylor,
what would you recommend?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.746
- A CBC, BMP,

13:54.790 --> 13:57.358
transvaginal ultrasound,
and a pregnancy test.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.839
- Okay. Good. Good.
- She's not pregnant.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.712
- Well, just standard fare.
We'll get back to you.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.584
[uneasy music]

14:06.628 --> 14:09.718
Page Dr. Charles.
- Got it.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.027
.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.725
- We're the last people
who need a psychiatrist.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.118
- We're very happy.
- I'm really glad to hear that.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.902
- I'm feeling much better.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.773
- It's probably
the hydromorphone,

14:21.817 --> 14:24.211
the pain medication
we gave you.

14:24.254 --> 14:27.910
Look, the tests have showed
that a cyst has ruptured,

14:27.954 --> 14:29.825
and there's bleeding.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.871
Well, Gemma,
you need an operation,

14:31.914 --> 14:34.177
and if we can't
save your ovary,

14:34.221 --> 14:35.787
we do have to remove it.

14:35.831 --> 14:39.052
- Just as long
as they take mine, too.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.793
- Why is that?
- So we have the same scar.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.404
- But not just that.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.536
We always planned to get
pregnant at the same time.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.931
And If she can't,
I can't either.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.238
- Oh, okay. All right.

14:51.281 --> 14:55.503
So have you guys
always dressed exactly alike?

14:55.546 --> 14:57.026
- No.
- No.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.072
When we were kids,
our mother wouldn't let us.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.030
- We hated that.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.424
- As soon as we could,
we moved out.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.513
Remember the first time
we bought matching dresses?

15:05.556 --> 15:08.951
- It was heaven.
Now we do everything together.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.519
- Hmm? Everything?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.303
- Eat, sleep, take showers.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.392
- Go to the bathroom.
- Wow.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.438
- COVID was actually
really good for us.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.918
- How's that?

15:18.961 --> 15:21.442
- Lockdown, we were with one
another and no one else

15:21.485 --> 15:23.226
for a year and a half.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.446
- Brought us even closer.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.318
- Kind of hard to--to tell
where one of you begins,

15:28.362 --> 15:29.885
and the other one ends.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.279
- Exactly.
both: We're one person.

15:37.110 --> 15:40.330
- So look, it's not unusual
for monozygotic twins

15:40.374 --> 15:42.463
to have a very strong bond.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.030
- So that's normal?
- No. Not at all.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.596
Not to this extent.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.903
We're looking at an extreme
lack of individuation here.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.122
- What does that mean?

15:49.165 --> 15:51.080
- Well, normally,
when children develop,

15:51.124 --> 15:52.342
even identical twins,

15:52.386 --> 15:54.040
they start
to form a sense of self,

15:54.083 --> 15:55.824
you know,
an individual identity.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.000
Somehow, with these two, that
just--it just never happened.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.133
- All right.
Okay, so they're--well,

16:00.176 --> 16:01.482
what's the word
I'm supposed to use?

16:01.525 --> 16:03.484
Delusional?
And now he's going to tell us

16:03.527 --> 16:05.007
that they have
decisional capacity

16:05.051 --> 16:06.400
and that we
can't force treatment.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.054
- That's correct.
- See?

16:08.097 --> 16:09.838
- I've been over it with them
a couple of times,

16:09.881 --> 16:11.971
and they fully understand
the potential consequences.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.885
- So what do we do?

16:13.929 --> 16:16.497
- Well, we certainly can't
operate on the healthy twin.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.152
- Are you seriously thinking
that I was considering that?

16:19.195 --> 16:20.849
- You know, with your history,

16:20.892 --> 16:22.546
I mean,
I guess you just never know.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.896
- Is there any chance that this
will resolve without surgery?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.159
- Yeah, a small one.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.943
I mean, we can keep an eye
on her hemoglobin,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.337
but if it drops lower
or she becomes unstable,

16:30.380 --> 16:32.252
then we have to take her
to the OR.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.081
- With their consent.
- Okay.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.912
- Hey, Will,
I wanted to tell you,

16:40.956 --> 16:43.350
I know your brother, Jay.
- Really? How's that?

16:43.393 --> 16:45.178
- Used to be
in the same line of work.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.006
- No kidding?

16:47.049 --> 16:50.052
- Dr. Scott, we need
a peds consult over in Baghdad.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.619
Ten-year-old girl.
Extremely lethargic.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.056
- Catch you later.
- Yeah.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.538
- It's not a diabetic issue.
Blood glucose is normal.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.235
- Heat exhaustion?
- No. We hung fluids.

16:59.279 --> 17:00.454
She hasn't responded.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.891
- Hey, Jasmine.
Can you hear me?

17:02.934 --> 17:04.371
- She's never like this.

17:04.414 --> 17:09.071
- Jasmine? Hey.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.377
- I wanna go home.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.074
- That's better.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.598
Now, can you squeeze
my fingers?

17:16.992 --> 17:18.298
Good. Other side.

17:20.430 --> 17:24.130
- Honey, do what
the doctor says.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.522
- Jasmine, come one.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.134
There you go. Thank you.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.484
Motor and speech intact.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.226
- Does Jasmine have any
pre-existing conditions

17:33.269 --> 17:34.227
that we should know about?

17:34.270 --> 17:36.229
- Well, when she was born,

17:36.272 --> 17:37.708
they told me
that she had sickle cell.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.320
But it doesn't seem to
bother her

17:40.363 --> 17:42.452
other than getting some pain
once in a while.

17:42.496 --> 17:43.975
- Head CT?

17:44.019 --> 17:45.107
- Yeah, but I doubt
it'll tell us anything

17:45.151 --> 17:46.543
we don't already know.
Maggie?

17:46.587 --> 17:48.371
- Right here.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.112
- You need to send Jasmine in
for a head CT.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.983
- All right.
I'll let Radiology know.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.987
- Ooh!
- Are you all right?

17:56.031 --> 18:00.122
- Yeah. Fine.
Just a little stiff.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.472
- We also need to set up
for an exchange transfusion.

18:02.516 --> 18:03.604
- Okay.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.562
- A transfusion? Blood?

18:05.606 --> 18:07.521
- Yeah. We believe
your daughter's condition

18:07.564 --> 18:09.305
is because of her sickle cell.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.221
- Blood with normal cells
will help her feel better.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.658
- I'll make sure
they red cell phenotype.

18:14.702 --> 18:18.227
Aleesha, you'll give us
the best match.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.622
- We'll talk with you after
Jasmine has had her scan, okay?

18:21.665 --> 18:23.189
All right.

18:29.282 --> 18:30.587
- So do you think a guy
who orders

18:30.631 --> 18:32.981
the same thing every day
is dependable or boring?

18:33.024 --> 18:34.722
- Depends on the man.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.638
- Hey, Matt.
- Will.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.162
Hey, I thought
they gave you the boot.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.164
- Turns out they can't live
without me.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.297
If this guy's done
bothering you,

18:44.340 --> 18:46.429
I'll take a chicken Caesar.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.083
- Thanks, Skyler.

18:49.780 --> 18:53.175
- It's been a while, huh?
- How's Moira?

18:53.219 --> 18:55.482
- Good. And married.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.573
- Wow, I blew that one.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.488
- I'm sure you're doing fine.

19:01.531 --> 19:06.145
- I'm married now.
Trying to be a good boy.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.454
- You're not busy.
We should get a drink.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.326
Catch up.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.197
- Yeah, sure.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.025
- Chicken Caesar.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.332
- Hey, good to see you, man.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.595
- Yeah. Take care.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.513
- Dr. Archer, Dr. Taylor.

19:26.556 --> 19:30.343
- Ow--ow!
[alarm blaring]

19:30.386 --> 19:31.692
- Help her!

19:31.735 --> 19:34.085
- Another milligram
of hydromorphone.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.697
- She's tachycardic
and hypotensive. Temp's 101.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.612
- All right.
Only one unit of blood.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.091
And a unit of FFP.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.223
- Got it.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.616
- All right, Gemma,
you are bleeding.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.444
We need to get you up
to surgery right now.

19:44.487 --> 19:47.142
- Take us both.
- I cannot do that.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.230
- Then no surgery.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.753
- All right,
listen to me, okay?

19:49.797 --> 19:52.234
You could bleed to death.
You understand? You could die.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.671
- You have to save her.
Take me to surgery.

19:54.715 --> 19:58.371
[alarm blaring,
whistle blowing]

19:59.285 --> 20:01.330
- Anything? Hmm? Any ideas?

20:01.374 --> 20:02.636
- Okay, let's get you
on your back.

20:02.679 --> 20:03.811
Let's get you on your back.
One, two, three.

20:07.510 --> 20:07.641
.

20:07.684 --> 20:10.339
Her pain's lessened.
Fever's down.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.428
The antibiotics are working,
but for how long?

20:12.472 --> 20:15.214
- Yeah. Okay, thanks.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.357
- We don't have anything
more to say.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.576
- If you really want
to save Gemma,

20:29.619 --> 20:31.360
you have to operate
on me first.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.362
- You know, I've been thinking
about our first conversation.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.582
And you mentioned that you--you

20:35.625 --> 20:37.627
both wanted to get pregnant
at the same time.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.586
And I-I absolutely appreciate.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.588
how much joy that
that would bring you.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.329
- We'll be okay.

20:43.372 --> 20:44.982
- I'm sure you will.

20:45.026 --> 20:48.638
But you also said
that sometimes you like

20:48.682 --> 20:51.075
to think of yourself
as one person.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.599
- We are one person.
- Okay.

20:52.642 --> 20:56.472
Well, genetically, anyway,
you absolutely are, right?

20:56.516 --> 20:58.257
You were born
from a single egg.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.997
You share the same genes.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.390
- Yeah, we know that. So?

21:01.434 --> 21:04.654
- So if one of you were to
have a baby, say, Emma,

21:04.698 --> 21:07.440
with her one ovary,
were to get pregnant,

21:07.483 --> 21:11.357
well, it might as well be
Gemma's child too.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.707
- That's true.
- So, in a sense,

21:13.750 --> 21:18.625
you would be bringing a child
into the world together, right?

21:18.668 --> 21:21.671
And I just still think
that that would be

21:21.715 --> 21:24.631
a tremendously satisfying,
joyful experience

21:24.674 --> 21:28.199
for the both of you,
I mean, wouldn't it?

21:29.723 --> 21:34.075
- That sounds kind of
nice, Emmie.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.514
- We'll think about it.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.735
- Okay.

21:46.435 --> 21:49.438
- Your daughter's scans confirm
what we had suspected.

21:49.482 --> 21:50.744
Jasmine suffered a stroke.

21:50.787 --> 21:55.401
- What? Stroke?
She's a little girl.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.794
- The abnormal shape
of the red blood cells

21:57.838 --> 22:00.014
can cause the blood
to become thicker,

22:00.057 --> 22:01.711
which can cause clotting
and lead to stroke.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.234
- When Jasmine was diagnosed,

22:03.278 --> 22:04.671
didn't your doctor
tell you about that?

22:04.714 --> 22:06.673
- No.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.197
- Kids with sickle cell
should have a type of scan,

22:09.240 --> 22:11.330
a Transcranial Doppler,
once a year,

22:11.373 --> 22:13.070
to see if
they're prone to stroke.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.464
I'm guessing nobody told you
about that either.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.205
- No.
- And they should be

22:17.248 --> 22:19.381
on a medicine
called Hydroxyurea.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.904
- What is that?

22:20.948 --> 22:23.385
- It helps the red blood cells
maintain a normal shape.

22:23.429 --> 22:26.693
- Are you saying this
shouldn't have happened?

22:26.736 --> 22:30.784
Jasmine, she shouldn't
be sick like this?

22:30.827 --> 22:33.264
- I'm sorry, Ms. Russell.

22:33.308 --> 22:38.095
- Oh my God.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.837
I let this happen.
- No.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.317
- My baby.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.580
- No, this--this was
not your fault.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.234
- I'm her mother.

22:46.277 --> 22:49.324
I'm her mother.
I'm supposed to protect her.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.719
- This is your doctors' fault.
They should've told you.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.851
- It doesn't appear
that Jasmine's stroke

22:54.895 --> 22:57.593
was very severe.
She'll recover,

22:57.637 --> 23:00.553
and we can make sure
that this never happens again.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.511
- She's getting a transfusion,

23:02.555 --> 23:04.383
and she should get better
right away.

23:04.426 --> 23:08.125
- I just wanna be with her.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.269
- Why didn't anyone tell her?

23:21.312 --> 23:23.880
- Where were you
working before here?

23:23.924 --> 23:26.883
- Grosse Pointe.
Beaumont Hospital.

23:26.927 --> 23:31.497
- Ah. Well, this happens a lot
to kids who have sickle cell.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.499
Less than 50% get screened.

23:33.542 --> 23:36.240
On the other hand,
kids with cystic fibrosis.

23:36.284 --> 23:39.722
Well, they get a case manager,
regular check-ups.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.332
- 'Cause most CF patients
are white.

23:41.376 --> 23:42.856
- Mm-hmm.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.771
- Yeah, I get it.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.477
- So the twins have agreed
to Gemma's surgery?

23:55.521 --> 23:57.740
- Yeah, that's what I hear.
Good news, right?

23:57.784 --> 24:02.136
- Yeah. Sounds like you played
into their fantasy.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.442
- Yeah, maybe a bit.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.879
But can't really address
their psychiatric issues

24:05.922 --> 24:07.837
if one of them is dead.

24:07.881 --> 24:11.754
- [small laugh]
Whatever you say.

24:11.798 --> 24:14.757
- Cesar, what have we got?
- 60-year-old female.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.281
Hour prior to arrival, she had
an ataxic gait, garbled speech.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.893
Lost consciousness
in the ambo, and we intubated.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.634
No corneal reflexes. No gag.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.374
- Nancy, Dr. Taylor, with me.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.465
- Help her, please.
- Sir--sir, we're going to

24:26.508 --> 24:28.771
take care of her.
Angel.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.253
- How are things
with you and Dr. Taylor?

24:32.296 --> 24:38.172
- Ugh! She keeps her distance.
And I try to keep mine.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.696
- Well, it's not so easy.

24:40.740 --> 24:44.395
Not easy for most mothers,
but you'll keep trying.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.788
- Right.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.531
- Ooh, Dr. Halstead.
- Yeah.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.665
- So?
- Yeah, I said we should

24:52.708 --> 24:55.581
go out for drinks, catch up.
- Good.

24:55.624 --> 24:57.974
- Matt didn't seem
that enthusiastic.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.846
I don't know if it'll happen.

24:59.889 --> 25:02.283
- Well, you'll make it happen.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.547
- Dr. Halstead.

25:05.591 --> 25:06.896
- Excuse me.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.381
- BP's even lower.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.209
- Yeah. I was afraid
the morphine wouldn't work.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.819
- I need to take her
to surgery.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.342
- And do what exactly?

25:18.386 --> 25:20.519
- Replace the valve.
Unhook her. Let's go.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.259
- Well, the primary problem
isn't the valve.

25:22.303 --> 25:23.783
It's the outflow track.
It's obstructed.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.262
She needs a completely
different procedure

25:25.306 --> 25:26.786
from what you're suggesting.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.875
- What I see is severe
mitral valve regurgitation

25:28.918 --> 25:30.572
and an enlarged heart.
Let's go. Okay, guys, come on.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.313
- Crockett, you asked me
to consult

25:32.356 --> 25:34.228
because you know
I know this patient.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.751
- I understand.
But I don't have

25:35.795 --> 25:37.100
precise measurements, and
we don't have a cardiac cath.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.624
- So, do a cardiac cath.
You'll see I'm right.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.364
- I don't have time
to screw around, Will.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.410
With her condition this bad,
I need to operate now.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.759
- Yeah, and the bigger
the procedure

25:43.803 --> 25:45.369
the bigger the fee, right?

25:45.413 --> 25:46.893
But, hey, Medicare's
paying for it.

25:46.936 --> 25:49.286
- Keep going.
What was that?

25:49.330 --> 25:50.766
You think
that's what I'm about?

25:50.810 --> 25:52.942
Padding my bill?

25:52.986 --> 25:56.380
- No. No, I don't.
Forget it, man.

25:57.947 --> 26:00.428
- That's my patient.
I'm taking her to surgery.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.042
We all set with
the valve sizers?

26:06.086 --> 26:07.957
- Yeah.
We've got both mechanical

26:08.001 --> 26:09.698
and biosynthetic valves.

26:09.742 --> 26:12.658
- Good.
- Hey, Will.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.790
My scrub nurse
told me you were up here.

26:14.834 --> 26:18.620
- Yeah. Patient
from the clinical trial.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.840
- Oh, so already a history
of heart failure?

26:20.883 --> 26:22.493
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

26:23.712 --> 26:27.368
Not using a Vas-COM
to monitor cardiac output.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.631
- I guess not.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.633
- Vas-COM's really
a lot more accurate.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.026
- Oh, yeah?
- I don't want to

26:33.069 --> 26:34.636
step on any toes here,

26:34.680 --> 26:37.378
but you might
want to suggest it.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.772
- Yeah, sure.
Crockett.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.512
- Yeah.
- Dr. Cooper thinks

26:41.556 --> 26:42.862
you should use a Vas-COM.

26:42.905 --> 26:45.952
- Oh? Hey, Matt.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.867
Well, I've got this
handled, bud.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.564
Old set-up's just fine,
all right?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.087
- Yeah.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.655
Sorry, your patient.
Didn't mean to intrude.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.092
- Yeah. Okay, then.

26:56.136 --> 26:59.835
- Vas-COM really should be
standard of care.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.751
Well, he'll come around.

27:04.710 --> 27:05.885
- Okay, let's replace
the valve.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.800
- Hold on.
- What?

27:07.843 --> 27:10.672
- This doesn't look valvular.

27:10.716 --> 27:14.371
TEE indicates a sub-aortic
outflow obstruction.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.595
- Can you calculate
a gradient for me?

27:20.639 --> 27:24.555
- Gradient is 70MM of mercury.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.514
- Consistent with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

27:26.557 --> 27:27.646
- Yeah.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.691
- All right, folks,
change of plans.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.519
We are not gonna
replace the valve.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.739
We're gonna move to a myectomy.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.959

â™ª

27:43.923 --> 27:44.358
.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.229
- How's Ms. Jasmine doing?

27:46.273 --> 27:47.666
- She's sleeping.

27:47.709 --> 27:53.672
- Good. Why don't you step out?
Hmm?

27:56.979 --> 27:59.286
There's some coffee over
at the Nurses' Station.

27:59.329 --> 28:02.289
- Could use some.

28:06.946 --> 28:07.947
Oh--ooh!

28:07.990 --> 28:10.036
Oh God.
- Let me help you. Okay.

28:10.079 --> 28:12.734
- Here, I got you.
- No. Please, I'm okay.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
- No, let's just get you
where you can lie down.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.998
- I'm going to get you
two ready, okay?

28:16.042 --> 28:17.304
- All right.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.610
- Come on. Just take it easy.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.351
- Come right here.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.658
- Okay.
- Nice and slow.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.056
- I don't need anything.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.362
- Your knees are giving you
a lot of trouble.

28:32.406 --> 28:35.583
- Aleesha, let the doctors
take a look, okay?

28:35.626 --> 28:36.932
- Did you injure yourself?

28:36.976 --> 28:38.629
- No.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.458
- Burning sensation?

28:41.502 --> 28:44.331
- Let's get an x-ray.
- Okay.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.865
- Clear.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.871
- Your knees
are severely arthritic.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.655
How long have
they been like this?

29:04.699 --> 29:06.962
- I don't know. Few months.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.052
- Have you seen a doctor?

29:10.096 --> 29:12.576
- Told me to take some aspirin.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.665
- We're going to give you
something

29:14.709 --> 29:18.931
a little more effective.
Toradol, 30 mg, IM.

29:18.974 --> 29:21.803
Your hips seem to be giving you
a lot of pain as well.

29:23.370 --> 29:24.632
Aleesha?

29:24.675 --> 29:26.721
- Yeah.

29:28.549 --> 29:29.898
- There you go.

29:29.942 --> 29:32.727
- I have to ask...

29:32.771 --> 29:36.600
are you living in your car?

29:40.648 --> 29:44.870
- No. Why'd you ask me that?

29:46.132 --> 29:49.396
- You're very young to have
such advanced arthritis.

29:49.439 --> 29:52.616
And you're not overweight.
I'm sorry.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.359
I don't mean to embarrass you,

29:56.403 --> 29:58.971
but I've seen arthritis
like this in people

29:59.014 --> 30:01.495
who sleep sitting up
in the confines of a car.

30:08.023 --> 30:11.940
I'm only asking
so that we can help you.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.117
Aleesha?

30:18.555 --> 30:20.819
It's okay. It's okay.

30:20.862 --> 30:25.040
We're going to get you
some meds to manage the pain,

30:25.084 --> 30:26.868
maybe a brace.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.740
Get you in
a physical therapy program.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.177
The important thing
is exercise.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.875
Gotta get you moving.

30:35.224 --> 30:38.184
It's going to be okay.

30:38.227 --> 30:42.710
[somber music]

30:42.753 --> 30:45.582
â™ª

30:45.626 --> 30:47.149
- Okay.

30:47.193 --> 30:50.065
- That was an impressive call.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.024
How'd you guess they were
sleeping in their car?

30:52.067 --> 30:53.590
- Oh, you mean,
the Grosse Pointe thing?

30:53.634 --> 30:56.767
Actually, I was surprised
you didn't catch it.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.160
I mean, don't cops

30:58.204 --> 30:59.901
have a lot of experience
with homeless folks?

30:59.945 --> 31:01.163
- Oh, you mean like,

31:01.207 --> 31:03.513
"Move along,
you can't sleep here"?

31:03.557 --> 31:05.776
- Yeah, just like that.
- Yeah.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.867
- Yeah.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.567
- I need a doctor.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.011
- You better go in.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.722
- You need to call it.

31:56.001 --> 31:59.569
- Time of death, 1605.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.270
I am so sorry.
The stroke was too massive.

32:04.313 --> 32:07.142
There was nothing
that we could do.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.080
- I know that was hard.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.131
I'm sorry.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.014
- Dr. Halstead.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.929
- Ms. Goodwin, I can't do this.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.887
I am not the guy
for what you need.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.193
I'm uncomfortable.

32:58.237 --> 33:01.675
I don't like being suspicious
of people, lying.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.764
So if my staying here
is dependent

33:03.807 --> 33:05.244
on doing this for you,

33:05.287 --> 33:06.854
I'd just as soon work
somewhere else.

33:06.897 --> 33:09.770
- Hold on. I was expecting
this conversation.

33:09.813 --> 33:12.033
I've got something
I want you to see.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.864
- What's this?
- A recent case.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.127
Young man, 23 years old.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.347
After insertion of a Vas-COM
catheter,

33:21.390 --> 33:24.350
he developed infection,
gangrene.

33:24.393 --> 33:27.875
Spent two weeks in the ICU,
and lost his leg.

33:27.918 --> 33:31.618
If the Vas-COM was indeed
an unnecessary procedure,

33:31.661 --> 33:35.622
then this was a tragedy
that never should've happened.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.327
- Okay.

33:45.371 --> 33:48.243
So it's not a big procedure.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.376
Probably won't take more
than an hour. You ready?

33:50.419 --> 33:52.291
Okay, Camila?

33:52.334 --> 33:55.642
- Gemma, I'm going to put you
to sleep now.

33:55.685 --> 33:58.384
Can you count back from ten?

33:58.427 --> 34:02.170
- Ten, nine...

34:07.436 --> 34:10.700
- How are you doing?

34:16.358 --> 34:20.319
Emma, I know what a difficult
decision this was for you

34:20.362 --> 34:22.930
and your sister. I do.

34:22.973 --> 34:25.106
- We always wanted
to have babies.

34:25.150 --> 34:29.328
- You can.
And, trust me,

34:29.371 --> 34:32.896
I know that you would come to
think of them as both of yours.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.076
What?

34:39.729 --> 34:41.296
- I'm sorry.

34:41.340 --> 34:44.386
- For what?
You're sorry for what, Emma?

34:44.430 --> 34:49.043
- I didn't want her to do it.
She wouldn't listen.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.305
- Do what?

34:52.742 --> 34:56.398
No. No.

34:59.793 --> 35:02.143
Stop the surgery!
- What the hell, Dan?

35:02.187 --> 35:05.146
- They switched places.
That's not Gemma.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.843
It's not her.

35:20.901 --> 35:21.119
.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.685
- While your dad's
getting the car,

35:22.729 --> 35:23.730
we got a minute to talk.

35:23.773 --> 35:25.993
- Oh, man.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.038
- Your little
knucklehead friends?

35:28.082 --> 35:30.954
You're done with them.
I mean it.

35:30.998 --> 35:33.783
You see that cop over there?
He works the West Side.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.611
He sees you over there,
he's going to tell me,

35:35.655 --> 35:40.225
and I'm going to tell your dad.
Ah, there he is now.

35:40.268 --> 35:42.227
- Thanks, Doc.

35:42.270 --> 35:45.752
- Yeah. He's a fine young man.
Keep an eye on him.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.057
I don't want to
see him here again

35:47.101 --> 35:48.842
- You can count on that.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.887
I still don't see
how he got bit by a snake.

35:50.931 --> 35:53.629
- Yeah, we have to
ask him that.

35:53.673 --> 35:54.935
- Seems like we need

35:54.978 --> 35:58.156
to have a discussion
when we get back home.

36:02.899 --> 36:07.121
- Hey, stay safe, all right?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.950
People care about you.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.834
- They have matching scars now.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.010
Maybe that'll be enough
to satisfy them.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.709
- You know, I've been doing
this almost 40 years.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.798
Never have I ever...
- [laughing]

36:31.841 --> 36:34.148
- I mean, not even close.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.803
- Yeah, they really did
hoodwink us, didn't they?

36:36.846 --> 36:39.414
But at least you caught it
before I took her ovary out.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.068
I'd say that's a win.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.204
What? You're wondering
if I'm being genuine, huh?

36:46.247 --> 36:49.207
See, that's the curse
of being a shrink.

36:50.860 --> 36:51.905
- Hmm.

36:52.993 --> 36:59.260
- Hey, so you were right.
You did know your patient.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.223
- You know,
Natalie's mom is doing well.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.010
In large part thanks to you.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.881
- That's nice to hear.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.711
You miss her?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.937
- Yeah.

37:26.983 --> 37:30.378
- Yeah, me too.

37:30.422 --> 37:33.468
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.733
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.484
- You're admitting this patient
with sickle cell?

37:49.528 --> 37:52.400
- Yeah.
Just waiting on a bed upstairs.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.925
- Good work today.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.975
- They'll bring in
a cot for Aleesha.

38:02.018 --> 38:05.195
Kid has to have a stroke
for her mom to get a bed.

38:05.239 --> 38:08.329
- Med's running a gene
therapy trial for sickle cell.

38:08.373 --> 38:11.245
Possible cure.
If I can enroll Jasmine,

38:11.289 --> 38:13.291
Aleesha will have a bed
for more than just a night.

38:46.541 --> 38:50.328
- Mom? It's me, Mom.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.993
- Can I come inside?

39:06.344 --> 39:08.258
- Step over that.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.969
- It's taken me a while
to find you.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.318
What happened to the van?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.886
- Broke down.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.454
- You been taking your meds?

39:29.497 --> 39:31.412
- I thought you moved.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.241
- I'm back now.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.289
Here, let me have a listen.

39:44.294 --> 39:49.212
- I ran out.
- I'll get you more pills.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.391
Deep breath.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.612
You sound a little congested.

39:57.656 --> 40:00.354
- Yeah. Well, just so you know,
I got vaccinated.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.008
I'm not stupid.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.271
- Okay.

40:04.314 --> 40:07.535
But Mom, please, we've got
to get you off the streets.

40:07.579 --> 40:13.193
- I can take care of myself.
- No. You're not doing that.

40:14.934 --> 40:17.502
No. I'm not going to
let you live like this.

40:17.545 --> 40:20.026
Hear me?

40:20.069 --> 40:24.247
[melancholy music]

40:24.291 --> 40:29.078
