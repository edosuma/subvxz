WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:03.502
Miss, I'm done here.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.770
Oh, I've been done here
for years.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.939
You don't see me
getting a parade.

00:06.941 --> 00:09.675
(generator hums)

00:09.677 --> 00:11.910
OLEG: Oh, looks like
we lost electricity.

00:11.912 --> 00:16.715
Uh-oh, all the food in the
refrigerator will go worse.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.617
EARL: Is it a bad sign that

00:18.619 --> 00:22.054
I can actually
see everything better?

00:22.056 --> 00:25.824
Well, we finally found lighting
that made the food look edible.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.626
Yeah, it's almost dark enough
for Caroline

00:27.628 --> 00:30.062
to agree to have sex in here.

00:30.064 --> 00:34.033
Max, have you ever seen balls
in light?

00:35.235 --> 00:37.736
They're not pretty.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.506
HAN: Nobody panic!

00:40.508 --> 00:42.307
The power is out
in the whole building.

00:42.309 --> 00:47.179
We've got less energy
than a Steely Dan concert.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.014
Han, you look exactly like

00:49.016 --> 00:52.251
a Doozer from "Fraggle Rock"
right now.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.386
All right, we've got
to keep the diner safe

00:54.388 --> 00:56.355
from hooligans and looters.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.257
You're still on the clock!

00:58.259 --> 01:01.560
And you're on my foot.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.930
Sorry, Earl, I can't see you
in the dark....

01:06.800 --> 01:09.768
But not in a racist way.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.438
And I can't see you
in the light

01:12.440 --> 01:14.506
in a short way.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.009
Han, who would loot this diner?

01:17.011 --> 01:20.813
Unless they're looters looking
specifically for disappointment.

01:25.351 --> 01:26.685
Max?

01:26.687 --> 01:28.887
Just taking this vodka

01:28.889 --> 01:31.090
and cash register
to a safe place.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.760
<i>(Peter Bjorn and John)</i>
<i>♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:34.762 --> 01:36.495

01:36.497 --> 01:41.867
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:46.339 --> 01:48.774
Our new dessert bar
is under construction

01:48.776 --> 01:49.975
and it's not quite there yet.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.410
Kind of like
the credit card bill

01:51.412 --> 01:53.278
I lied about mailing,

01:53.280 --> 01:57.116
but I've chosen you two to be
the first to get a preview.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.651
She invited other people.
They said, "No."

01:59.653 --> 02:02.921
She told me there would be
some hard candy.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.125
Better be some hard candy.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.427
I have peppermints inside.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.929
Then we're fine.

02:14.267 --> 02:17.102
So it doesn't
look like much now,

02:17.104 --> 02:19.905
but with a little moxie
and a lot of work,

02:19.907 --> 02:21.507
it's gonna be gorgeous.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.842
Like Khloé Kardashian.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.179
Is that the one
that's a dude now?

02:29.849 --> 02:33.385
Okay, where's my treat?

02:34.454 --> 02:35.654
Impressive,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.589
and you've stolen almost nothing

02:37.591 --> 02:39.725
from the diner to do this.

02:39.727 --> 02:44.796
Oh, wait, I see my sport coat is
being used as a paint rag.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.199
That coat's yours?

02:47.201 --> 02:50.636
I thought it belonged
to a service Chihuahua.

02:51.971 --> 02:55.040
Hey, everybody.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.945
Oh, yeah.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.414
Hubba, hubba, hot stuff.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.149
You know,
if I were still single,

03:04.151 --> 03:07.319
I'd let you spackle my hole.

03:07.321 --> 03:10.556
You heard what she said,
beefcake.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.924
I'm not gay.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.826
I'm just very pro-harassment.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.662
I'm proud of you, girls.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.664
You're making
your dreams come true,

03:18.666 --> 03:21.633
and my dreams, too,
assuming you'll allow me

03:21.635 --> 03:22.834
to start a tab here.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.504
I'll never pay.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.073
Does this mean you're not
paying your tab at the diner?

03:28.075 --> 03:30.876
Uh-huh.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.077
Earl?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.313
He walks fast when he wants to.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.216
I gotta get going too.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.984
You know, we just came
from the baby doctor,

03:38.986 --> 03:40.719
and he put me on bed rest.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.790
At first I thought
the doctor said, "Bed arrest,'

03:44.792 --> 03:47.559
which is one
of my favorite games.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.995
Sophie, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

03:49.997 --> 03:52.264
Well, I'm five months along,

03:52.266 --> 03:54.366
and the baby
already weighs 15 pounds,

03:54.368 --> 03:57.369
so the doctor's just
a little worried.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.404
He's afraid it'll fall out

03:59.406 --> 04:02.708
like a watermelon
through a plastic grocery bag.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.744
Come on, baby,
let's get you in bed

04:05.746 --> 04:07.145
and get your legs up.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.981
I can't believe none of this
has to do with sex.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.382
Yeah.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.018
Knock, knock.
It's Randy.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.486
I got a six-pack...

04:15.855 --> 04:18.323
And I brought some beers.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.059
Who wants some warm,
wet, deli beer?

04:21.061 --> 04:23.462
This is why you're
the best boyfriend ever.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.631
Warm, wet deli beer
is the official drink

04:25.633 --> 04:28.166
of my personality.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.935
So, Randy, look.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.271
What do you think
of the new bar space?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.172
I've got a bar-related question.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.108
How you gonna fit in the bar?

04:36.110 --> 04:38.610
It's all right here
on the blueprints, see?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.746
The bar goes here,
so that leaves ten feet

04:40.748 --> 04:43.015
for the cafe tables
and the front door entrance.

04:43.017 --> 04:45.517
Uh, you see this
number ten right here?

04:45.519 --> 04:50.155
You see the two dashes after it?
Those are inches, not feet.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.426
You got 10 inches.

04:54.428 --> 04:58.263
First time I've ever been
disappointed with 10 inches.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.634
Well, that's the last time
I get an architect

05:02.636 --> 05:06.305
from the "casual encounters"
section of Craigslist.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.939
(knocking on wall)
Ugh.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.942
The lady from the pizza place
next door is banging back again.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.812
Yeah, they should pay less
attention to our business

05:13.814 --> 05:15.414
and more attention to their own.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.249
There's so much oil
on their pizza,

05:17.251 --> 05:19.151
the U.S. might invade it.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.352
RANDY:
You know what?

05:20.354 --> 05:21.753
I think we've just

05:21.755 --> 05:23.055
blown past "warm beers."

05:23.057 --> 05:24.556
I'm gonna go get us
some whiskey.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.326
10 inches always looks
a whole lot bigger with bourbon.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.763
Oh, my God, Max,
we need more space.

05:31.765 --> 05:35.000
I know; we spend
way too much time together.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.368
Hey!

05:36.370 --> 05:40.505
Enough with the noise,
cupcake bitches.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.543
You gotta stop with this
freakin' racket already.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.412
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, Gina.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.748
What, 'cause I'm Italian,

05:49.750 --> 05:52.184
my name's gotta be Gina?

05:52.186 --> 05:55.954
It's Angie.
Gina's my middle name.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.591
Oh, I thought your middle name
was "bangs a lot."

06:00.827 --> 06:02.794
Angie, we're expanding our shop,

06:02.796 --> 06:04.763
and we have a permit
for the construction,

06:04.765 --> 06:06.298
so it's above board.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.700
Which, yes,
even I'm surprised about.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.370
You got a permit
to destroy my business?

06:11.372 --> 06:14.539
Nobody wants to eat pizza

06:14.541 --> 06:18.043
next to this
constant freaking racket.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.546
What's your freaking point?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.749
Max, I didn't know
you spoke Italian.

06:25.184 --> 06:26.485
Follow me.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.954
I want yous to see
the hell you're making.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.856
Um, that's a firm pass.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.758
-I'll throw in a free slice.
-Okay.

06:38.931 --> 06:41.933
(video game beeping)

06:41.935 --> 06:43.268
See?

06:43.270 --> 06:44.569
See what you're doing
to our office

06:44.571 --> 06:46.471
from all that banging next door?

06:46.473 --> 06:48.273
You're destroying it.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.275
Uh, look, you can't
destroy a room

06:50.277 --> 06:53.745
that has this strong
of a "hostage basement" vibe.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.915
You got cracks,
and falling plaster,

06:56.917 --> 06:58.417
and my brother and I are fed up.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.152
Right, Angelo?

07:00.154 --> 07:02.053
He says, "Right."

07:02.055 --> 07:03.922
He's my twin.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.358
We agree with our minds.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.594
Um, Angie, when do we get
that free slice?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.663
Not to be pushy,
but a deal is a deal,

07:11.665 --> 07:13.932
and today's a carb day for me.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.802
(hammer banging on wall)

07:16.804 --> 07:18.437
What the frig?

07:18.439 --> 07:22.040
I just got my hair cut
for our high school reunion.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.475
Now it's ruined.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.277
(hammer banging on wall)

07:25.279 --> 07:28.547
It's a frickin' war zone
in here!

07:28.549 --> 07:31.049
My father would be turning
in his grave

07:31.051 --> 07:34.486
if we'd been able to give him
a proper burial.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.087
How you gonna make this right?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.423
Look, Angie and Angelo,

07:38.425 --> 07:40.459
we're sorry about
the inconvenience,

07:40.461 --> 07:42.394
but it'll just be another week
of construction.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.729
We promise to keep the noise
down to a minimum.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.465
Right, Max?

07:46.467 --> 07:48.667
She's agreeing with her mind.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.937
Hey, just came by
to see if everything's okay,

07:51.939 --> 07:54.506
and to say I've never seen
the statue of David

07:54.508 --> 07:57.209
with a slice of pizza
over his junk.

07:57.211 --> 08:00.412
Who's this hunk of gabbagoul?

08:00.414 --> 08:02.781
This hunk is Randy,
and he's my--

08:02.783 --> 08:06.485
Lawyer, and I'm sure he's here
to make sure there's no problem.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.953
There's not problem,
right, Angie?

08:07.955 --> 08:11.723
The only problem I see now
is that shirt on him.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.862
Hi, I'm Angie,

08:16.864 --> 08:21.266
but I'm thinking about
changing my name to yours.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.169
Props,
that's a good line.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.272
So, Angie, what do you think?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.241
Can you stand another week
of the construction?

08:29.243 --> 08:32.244
(clicks tongue)
All right.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.012
I'll give yous two another week,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.780
'cause of Randy here,

08:35.782 --> 08:38.350
but that's the last thing
I ever do for you two.

08:38.352 --> 08:42.120
You, I'd do whatever you want..

08:42.122 --> 08:46.124
tonight and in perpetuity.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.659
"Perpetuity"?

08:47.661 --> 08:51.563
Better not be Italian
for "the butt."

08:58.738 --> 09:00.138
Guys,

09:00.140 --> 09:03.608
I have a genius idea
to fix the dessert bar problem.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.678
What if somehow
we could convince Angie

09:06.680 --> 09:10.048
to let us break through the wall
and rent out their back office?

09:12.285 --> 09:13.652
Come on!

09:13.654 --> 09:16.621
This is a genius idea.

09:16.623 --> 09:19.457
Their business is struggling,

09:19.459 --> 09:21.960
and we could pay them rent.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.628
It's either that
or we have to use

09:23.630 --> 09:26.097
dollhouse furniture
for the dessert bar.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.299
You know what?
She's right.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.900
It is a good idea.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.570
You just gotta figure out a way
to get on Angie's good side.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.739
Maybe you bring her
a bouquet of cigarettes.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.043
Okay, Caroline, the only thing
Angie likes about us is him,

09:38.045 --> 09:40.879
and honestly, the only thing
I like about us is him.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.148
That's perfect;
we should bring Randy over there

09:43.150 --> 09:44.516
when we go ask her.

09:44.518 --> 09:47.118
Randy, this has got to work,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.486
so wear a tight shirt,

09:48.488 --> 09:50.789
and maybe put a little Parmesan
behind your ears.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.927
(video game beeping)
(construction banging)

09:55.929 --> 09:58.029
Uh.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.533
So, Angelo, any idea when
your sister is getting back?

10:01.535 --> 10:04.336
(video game music)

10:04.338 --> 10:07.939
Well, it is a long commute
from hell.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.475
Oh...

10:10.477 --> 10:11.876
Hi, Randy.

10:11.878 --> 10:15.513
I would make out with you,
but I just got a manicure,

10:15.515 --> 10:18.550
and I like to use my nails.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.953
Next time.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.556
So we came here
with a business proposition,

10:24.558 --> 10:26.691
and some delicious cupcakes.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.159
I'll need the plate back.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.462
Get those away from me!

10:30.464 --> 10:33.031
I'm going to my reunion
in a dress so tight

10:33.033 --> 10:35.166
you could see
the kidney Angelo gave me

10:35.168 --> 10:39.437
from when I had renal failure
from drinking too much Tab.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.942
First of all, Angie,
Max and I are so glad

10:43.944 --> 10:46.978
to hear that you pulled through
from the renal failure,

10:46.980 --> 10:49.948
but the real reason
we're here is--

10:49.950 --> 10:52.517
did you see Randy?

10:52.519 --> 10:53.718
Look, let's move this along.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.953
We want to bust
through this wall

10:54.955 --> 10:56.588
and rent your little
pizza hut here.

10:56.590 --> 10:57.789
Well, I'm in charge,

10:57.791 --> 10:59.357
and I'm not renting to yous two.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.892
I don't have time for this.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.328
I still don't have a date
for my reunion tomorrow,

11:03.330 --> 11:05.030
and this stress
is bad for my face.

11:05.032 --> 11:08.566
I already have more filler
than a two-hour "Dateline."

11:11.237 --> 11:13.571
Angie, how does a woman like you

11:13.573 --> 11:15.774
not have a date
for your reunion?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.776
I mean, not to be too forward,

11:17.778 --> 11:20.211
but hot magenta
really brings out your eyes.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.314
Well, you're not wrong.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.017
You know what would be wrong?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.486
If Randy didn't take you

11:28.488 --> 11:31.222
to your reunion tomorrow night.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.459
Do you want to be punched
in the face with my ring hand?

11:34.461 --> 11:36.094
RANDY: You know what?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.929
That...

11:37.931 --> 11:40.432
is a great idea.

11:40.434 --> 11:44.035
Angie, I would be honored
to take your to your reunion.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.370
Oh, my God!

11:45.372 --> 11:48.006
Really?

11:48.008 --> 11:50.842
What about Angelo?
What's he supposed to do?

11:50.844 --> 11:55.613
Angelo, do you want to bring one
of these two to the reunion?

11:55.615 --> 11:58.483
They're not my type.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.885
Two fives make a ten, right?

12:06.192 --> 12:08.059
Oleg!
(bell dings)

12:08.061 --> 12:10.228
I know we don't really
have standards here,

12:10.230 --> 12:14.599
but the customer said that
her steak shouldn't do this.

12:16.669 --> 12:21.272
Well, tell her not to turn
the plate upside down then.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.007
I'm FaceTiming with Sophie.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.209
She's lonely.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.112
Say "hi" to Caroline.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.948
I'm not that lonely.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.318
Ugh, I just scrubbed a table.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.819
That is how upset I am.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.522
I should have never let Randy
go to that reunion.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.424
And I should have never

12:39.426 --> 12:42.761
let Buddy Holly
get on that plane,

12:42.763 --> 12:44.095
but what're you gonna do?

12:44.097 --> 12:47.499
Other than play it
over and over again

12:47.501 --> 12:50.168
in your mind for 60 years.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.070
Max, it'll all be worth it

12:52.072 --> 12:54.105
when we get that extra space
for our dessert bar.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.741
Why would God make Randy
look like that

12:56.743 --> 12:59.210
if not to help us get stuff?

12:59.212 --> 13:00.812
I'm worried about Randy.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.647
He is strong,
but she has the strength

13:02.649 --> 13:04.616
of ten horny women.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.085
Somebody talk to me.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.187
I'm dying here.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.590
I just watched all eight seasons
of "Perfect Strangers."

13:12.592 --> 13:15.927
I'm--I'm just--I'm--
I'm Balki'd out.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.898
I just felt a shift
in the force.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.634
Did somebody clean a table
over there?

13:22.636 --> 13:23.902
Is everything okay?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.904
She's upset because Angie

13:25.906 --> 13:28.006
from the pizza parlor next door
needed a date

13:28.008 --> 13:30.441
to her high school reunion,
and Randy took her.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.510
Well, that's hurtful.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.579
I've asked Angie out twice.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.582
They're not
on a real date, Han.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.450
He's just trying to convince her

13:39.452 --> 13:40.885
to let us rent
their back office.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.954
Randy's wasting his time.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.590
It's actually Angie's
delightful brother Angelo

13:45.592 --> 13:47.091
who controls the lease.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.494
Angelo's in charge?

13:49.496 --> 13:52.197
Angelo's "delightful"?

13:52.199 --> 13:55.366
Ugh, I am so bored

13:55.368 --> 13:59.637
that I just got a degree
from DeVry University.

14:00.773 --> 14:04.042
So she tricked Randy

14:04.044 --> 14:05.710
into going to that reunion
with her?

14:05.712 --> 14:07.779
(scoffs)
I am going to the high school

14:07.781 --> 14:09.514
to get my man back--
oh, my God,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.516
I sound just like my mother.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.852
We should go there
and sweet-talk Angelo

14:13.854 --> 14:15.386
into giving us the space.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.822
Oh, but we're "not his type,"

14:17.824 --> 14:19.791
which is a shame,
because I really wanted some of

14:19.793 --> 14:22.894
that 50-year-old
video-game-addict money.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.296
Well, where are we gonna
get tacky dresses

14:25.298 --> 14:27.131
and hair from 1986?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.266

14:28.268 --> 14:30.835
I can make you
look like it's 1986

in 2003!

15:49.783 --> 15:52.150
Actually,
we came here to talk to you

15:52.152 --> 15:53.451
because we wanted to ask you

15:53.453 --> 15:55.119
about renting out
your back office.

We know you're the big cheese.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.558
maybe we, uh, cut a rug?

16:00.560 --> 16:04.996
She hasn't cut her rug
in about four months, so...

16:07.466 --> 16:10.101
We could, uh, start off
on the dance floor,

16:10.103 --> 16:12.136
and if we happen to end up

16:12.138 --> 16:15.340
in the back of
an '86 Cutlass Supreme,

This is my hair.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.225
Angie, is that true?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.627
Did I do the Electric Slide
for nothing?

17:09.629 --> 17:10.995
Well, not for nothing.

17:10.997 --> 17:14.432
We came in second

17:18.838 --> 17:20.805
My father thought
he was the smarter one

17:20.807 --> 17:23.408
because he wore glasses
as a kid.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.144
Randy, are you okay?

17:26.146 --> 17:29.814
Did the bad lady touch you
in any of the good places?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.216

17:32.218 --> 17:34.585
but for what it's worth,
I'm having the night of my life.

Believe it or not,
I wasn't popular in high school.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.857
I didn't date a football player

17:39.859 --> 17:42.560
or get pregnant.

For once, I just wanted
to show up a winner.

-Oh, no.
