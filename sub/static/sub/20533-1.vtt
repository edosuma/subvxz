09:03.793 --> 09:04.919
coming back
for the woman he loves.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.005
Ah. See? Some love stories

09:07.047 --> 09:08.673
do have a happy ending.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.675
Yeah, and then I called Ade,
and she said, uh,

09:10.717 --> 09:12.969
"Dixon can suck it," and that
she's never taking him back.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.888
So Dixon's probably waiting
for her at the pier,

09:14.929 --> 09:16.764
and I-I can't bring myself to be

09:16.806 --> 09:18.599
the one that...
rips his heart out.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.561
Oh, come on! Why me?

09:21.602 --> 09:23.563
Because you're his sister,
and-and if he starts crying

09:23.604 --> 09:27.234
to you on the phone, he
could pretend it doesn't
make him less of a man.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.318
Navid's got a point.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.986
Fine.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.281
I can't wait for
today to be over.
Thank you.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.367
(ringing)

09:39.413 --> 09:40.788
Hello?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.832
Um, hi. This is
Annie Wilson calling.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.834
I'm looking for
my brother, Dixon.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.878
I'm pretty sure
this is his phone,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.088
so is he there?

09:48.129 --> 09:50.173
I'm sorry. This is
the County Morgue.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.674
You need to come down here

09:51.716 --> 09:54.594
right away.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.600
(theme music playing)

10:15.615 --> 10:18.201
NAOMI: This is going to be
the best elopement ever.
Oh, yeah!

10:18.243 --> 10:19.327
Looky, looky, looky

10:19.369 --> 10:21.996
what I found.
(laughs)
Ooh.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.706
Hey, maybe after the
wedding we can find

10:23.748 --> 10:25.333
a motel with one
of those bathtubs

10:25.375 --> 10:26.626
shaped like a giant
champagne glass.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.169
Honey?
Huh?

10:28.211 --> 10:30.838
We are not bathing in
our one and only wedding gift.
All right.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.132
I accept the fact

10:32.173 --> 10:34.634
that we are most likely
getting married at a truck stop

10:34.675 --> 10:36.761
with a reception to follow
at a vending machine,

10:36.803 --> 10:39.931
but at least,
thank God we have this.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.267
(sighs)

10:42.309 --> 10:44.227
Oh, "Congratulations on the...

10:44.269 --> 10:46.354
biggest mistake of your life"?

10:46.396 --> 10:47.481
That's sweet.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.815
Must be from Alec.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.400
Who's Alec?

10:50.442 --> 10:52.360
He's my college roommate
and business partner.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.363
We have a favorite quote
by Albert Einstein:

10:55.405 --> 10:57.616
"Anyone who has never
made a mistake

10:57.657 --> 10:59.784
has never tried anything new."

10:59.826 --> 11:00.952
(chuckles)

11:00.994 --> 11:02.703
It's just Alec's way
of saying good luck.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.457
Well, I'm very happy
that he is with us in spirit.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.250
(cork pops, Naomi screams)
Oh! Oh!

11:07.292 --> 11:10.295
My eye!

11:24.058 --> 11:25.935
(groans)

11:25.977 --> 11:29.272
On second thought, maybe
we shouldn't drink and drive.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.735
♪ ♪

11:34.777 --> 11:37.738
That was a fun way to
get to know each other.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.158
(laughs)

11:40.200 --> 11:43.662
So... what's your name?

11:43.702 --> 11:45.246
Do you really need to know?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.499
(laughs)

11:47.541 --> 11:50.418
Look, I just went through
a really bad breakup,

11:50.460 --> 11:53.171
and I needed to get
the guy out of my head,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.256
but I'm not looking
for anything more.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.593
So, you were using me?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.388
Yeah, I guess so.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.431
I'm sorry?

12:03.473 --> 12:04.683
No. I love being treated

12:04.723 --> 12:06.434
like a complimentary
hotel toothbrush.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.937
But I will have you
fill out this little...

12:09.979 --> 12:11.939
satisfaction survey.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.026
So the purpose of today--
was it business or pleasure?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.070
Um... business.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.405
Mm?
And pleasure.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.656
That's good to hear.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.575
And were your needs met
courteously and correctly?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.117
I can't complain.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.036
Damn straight
you can't.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.454
I was fantastic.
(laughs)

12:26.496 --> 12:29.290
So, you'd say this transaction
exceeded expectations?

12:29.332 --> 12:30.709
(laughs)

12:30.749 --> 12:33.253
Yeah, I guess I would.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.713
Well, I'm gonna write
down my phone number,

12:34.753 --> 12:36.089
'cause I don't
believe for one second

12:36.130 --> 12:37.507
you won't want
to do this again.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.051
(laughs)

12:40.093 --> 12:42.262
Oh, crap!
I am so late!

12:42.303 --> 12:43.846
Austin is gonna be pissed.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.805
Ex-boyfriend?

12:44.847 --> 12:45.932
No. My manager.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.435
I'm on stage
in 40 minutes. Aah.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.271
Wait, you're performing
at this hotel?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.106
Ah, not if I can't find my bra.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.191
Okay, got it.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.402
Well, um, this was great.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.528
Thank you.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.573
I finally know
that I'm ready to move on.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.324
Bye.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.036
(laughs)

13:08.246 --> 13:10.707
(sighs)

13:21.676 --> 13:24.137
What happened?

13:24.178 --> 13:26.473
Dixon's car was
hit by a truck.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.308
It was a
massive accident.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.060
Um, EMS pulled three
guys from the wreckage,

13:31.102 --> 13:34.439
but they were all... all
found dead at the scene.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.524
The coroner
needs a...

13:36.566 --> 13:39.026
a family member to
identify the bodies.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.445
Did Annie...?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.656
No. She said
she can't do it alone.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.117
(sighs)

13:46.159 --> 13:48.077
We can't just let Annie
sit here forever.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.412
We have to go
in with her.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.080
LIAM:
Yeah.
(Silver sighs)

13:56.795 --> 13:58.505
Annie.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.590
Please...

14:00.632 --> 14:04.427
Please don't tell me
to go in there, Silver...

14:06.763 --> 14:08.807
...'cause if I go in there,

14:08.847 --> 14:10.767
and I see him...

14:10.809 --> 14:12.143
(sniffles)

14:12.185 --> 14:15.021
...then that means
that Dixon is really dead.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.190
And he...

14:18.191 --> 14:19.567
And he can't be dead.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.152
I know what it feels like

14:21.194 --> 14:23.697
to be scared
to find out the truth.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.574
(sniffles)

14:26.616 --> 14:29.577
But I wasn't alone,
and neither are you.

14:31.329 --> 14:34.123
And if Dixon is in there, then,

14:34.165 --> 14:35.625
he shouldn't be alone, either.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.711
(sighs)

14:40.505 --> 14:42.923
(sniffles)

14:42.965 --> 14:45.009
(sighs)

14:46.511 --> 14:47.595
All right.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.806
(inhales deeply
through nose)

14:58.648 --> 15:00.567
MAN:
The bodies are badly lacerated,

15:00.608 --> 15:02.694
and the personal effects
were scattered at the scene,

15:02.736 --> 15:04.654
making identification
difficult.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.282
Are you saying she might have
to look at all three of 'em?

15:09.659 --> 15:11.118
I'll check first,

15:11.160 --> 15:13.747
and if it is Dixon, then,

15:13.788 --> 15:16.123
Annie can confirm.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.584
(sighs)

15:17.625 --> 15:20.086
Can we get
through this?

15:26.509 --> 15:28.553
No.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.268
That's not Dixon, either.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.397
(Annie cries)

15:51.951 --> 15:54.662
(sniffles)

15:54.704 --> 15:56.205
(crying)

15:56.247 --> 15:57.749
(crying)

15:58.708 --> 15:59.918
(sniffles)

15:59.959 --> 16:01.168
It's not him.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.212
What?

16:03.254 --> 16:06.173
None of these is Dixon.
He's not here.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.550
It's impossible.
Dixon was in that car.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.760
MAN:
The police report

16:08.802 --> 16:09.886
lists a fourth victim.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.011
He appeared to
have been thrown

16:11.053 --> 16:13.097
from the crash and
found near the truck.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.933
They assumed he
was the driver.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.059
He was rushed to the hospital
in critical condition.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.270
It's Dixon.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.566
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

16:25.067 --> 16:27.153
(rhythmic beeping)

16:36.496 --> 16:39.499
Dixon, I'm here.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.251
We're-we're all here, and...

16:42.293 --> 16:44.044
we just...

16:44.086 --> 16:45.839
we really need you
to stay alive.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.132
Please?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.718
We love you.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.013
(quietly):
I love you...

16:54.054 --> 16:56.223
(sighs)

16:56.265 --> 16:58.309

Hello.

Hi. It's Annie. Um, I need
to speak to Ade about Dixon?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.423
Annie, this is not
a good time, okay?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.633
Ade doesn't need Dixon
in her head right now.

Can I handle this?

18:13.885 --> 18:16.095
Let me talk to her.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.723
Annie, I already told Navid
that Dixon and I done.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.017
Dixon was in a car accident,
Adrianna.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.185
He's in the hospital
fighting for his life right now,

18:23.227 --> 18:25.521
and the only thing
he's asking for is you.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.819
Hey, what did...?

Ugh.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.064
What now?

19:08.106 --> 19:09.857
We camp here
for the night

19:09.899 --> 19:11.317
living on flat champagne

19:11.358 --> 19:13.653
and breath mints
from the minibar?

19:13.694 --> 19:17.657
You know, actually, the desert
can be pretty romantic at night.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.826
(laughs)
Oh, really?
Yeah.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.160
We could gaze up
at the stars,

19:21.201 --> 19:23.121
and I could... I
could teach you

19:23.162 --> 19:25.414
how to identify all the
major constellations.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.582
Mmm.

(laughs)
Yeah?

19:28.292 --> 19:29.961
(coyote howling)

19:30.003 --> 19:33.131
Or the feeding habits
of predatory animals.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.257
That's not an option.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.218
Mm. (sighs)

19:38.260 --> 19:40.680
Take this.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.694
(tires squealing)

20:00.783 --> 20:02.660
We need a ride
to Nevada.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.912
Hop in if you don't mind
doing some of the driving.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.873
Oh.
Are you sure about this?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.290
I'm sure about us.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.085
Man.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.423
Naomi?

20:16.465 --> 20:18.092
She still isn't
picking up.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.218
Did you just
text her?

20:19.259 --> 20:20.553
You don't text someone
to tell them

20:20.594 --> 20:21.637
their friend
might be dying.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.014
Sorry. I forgot
you were an expert

20:23.056 --> 20:24.223
in life-and-death
situations.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.641
Well, it doesn't
take a semester

20:25.683 --> 20:27.101
at Princeton to know there's
some things you don't text.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.186
Guys, stop.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.396
Okay? We just need
to pack Annie a bag

20:30.437 --> 20:31.605
and get back to the hospital.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.691
(doorbell rings,
knocking on door)

20:33.733 --> 20:35.275
Who's that?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.360
Can I help you?

20:36.402 --> 20:37.570
I'm looking for Max Miller.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.905
Do you mind if we come in?

20:38.946 --> 20:39.947
Whoa. Are you a cop?
Alec Martin.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.158
I'm Max Miller's
business partner.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.202
And sorry for the drama,
but you know, Max is

20:44.243 --> 20:45.745
a pretty important guy,
and it's not like him

20:45.786 --> 20:46.829
to not answer his phone.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.288
Do you have any idea
where he can be?

20:48.330 --> 20:50.457
Well, we haven't seen him
since the wedding...

20:50.499 --> 20:51.584
um, that didn't happen.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.252
Our friend Naomi had
an "Aha" moment,

20:53.293 --> 20:54.670
which kind of
stopped everything.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.839
We haven't been able
to reach her since.

20:56.881 --> 20:57.840
Well, then, uh,

20:57.882 --> 20:59.217
sounds like
they're probably together.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.135
But these guys are still gonna
have to look around.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.344
For what?

21:02.386 --> 21:04.263
If you think Max is
hidden in the closet somewhere,

21:04.304 --> 21:06.015
you obviously don't
know Naomi Clark.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.767
Her closets are packed.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.228
You're right, I don't
know Naomi Clark,

21:10.269 --> 21:13.022
but I do know her previous
relationship with Max

21:13.064 --> 21:15.149
was, shall we say, volatile?

21:15.191 --> 21:16.650
Okay, she's never
gonna hurt Max.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.778
And it's nice that you
trust your friend,

21:18.819 --> 21:21.363
but Max is my friend, okay?

21:21.405 --> 21:22.615
I can't leave here

21:22.656 --> 21:25.325
until I know where
he is, and if he's okay.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.120
Well, suit yourself,
but I'm sure

21:27.161 --> 21:28.788
Max and Naomi are fine.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.291
NAOMI:
Just a few more miles
to Nevada.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.627
I mean, we could've been married
and on our second kid by now.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.170
This guy's stopped
at every gas station

21:36.212 --> 21:37.421
since we got in.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.673
Yeah, well, honestly, I think
he has medical condition.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.261
I saw a bunch of prescription
drugs in the glove compartment.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.889
Um, honey,

21:46.931 --> 21:48.515
I think maybe we should
get out of the car.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.559
Max, really? After everything
we've been through,

21:50.601 --> 21:52.019
why would we give up right now?

21:52.061 --> 21:54.563
Well, because I think
he's robbing the place.

21:54.605 --> 21:55.815
MAX:
Yeah, that's...

21:55.856 --> 21:57.275
NAOMI:
Oh, God.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.193
Let's go, let's go.
Drive!

21:59.235 --> 22:00.903
Okay, okay, okay...
Drive! Go, go, go!

22:06.826 --> 22:09.203
(sirens wailing)

22:09.245 --> 22:10.830
Go, go, go, go.
Yeah, stop.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.581
Go, go, go!
Oh, oh, oh!

22:12.623 --> 22:13.791
(all shouting)

22:13.833 --> 22:15.751
I don't know what to do!
Floor it! Floor it!

22:15.793 --> 22:16.877
Just go, go!

22:16.919 --> 22:18.420
NAOMI:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.214
POLICE OFFICER:
Nevada State Police, pull over.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.340
(sirens wailing)

22:21.381 --> 22:24.010
We made it to Nevada.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.849
TEDDY:
I'm just glad I was in
Sacramento when Silver called

22:29.890 --> 22:31.142
so I could be here.

22:31.184 --> 22:34.895
You made it to the morgue
awfully fast from Sacramento.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.148
Silver called me before
Dixon's accident.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.733
She said she had a big
decision she needed help with.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.278
Oh.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.487
So, uh...

22:43.529 --> 22:45.363
uh, what's the big decision?
LIAM: Was it about me?

22:45.405 --> 22:47.200
Why would it be about you?
Because I told her

22:47.241 --> 22:49.535
at the wedding that we don't
have to want the same things

22:49.576 --> 22:51.495
in order to be together.
Yeah, and I told Silver
at the wedding...

22:51.537 --> 22:53.664
Relax, guys. She wasn't calling
about either one of you.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.624
Well, what was she
calling about?

22:57.210 --> 22:59.628
She wants to have a baby...

22:59.670 --> 23:01.672
with me.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.013
I can explain.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.014
Teddy, just did.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.640
Were you ever gonna
tell me about this?

23:11.682 --> 23:13.391
Yes, after Teddy
made a decision.

23:13.433 --> 23:16.103
Teddy's decision? I put my heart
on the line, and your answer

23:16.145 --> 23:17.271
depends on whether or
not Teddy's willing

23:17.313 --> 23:18.438
to wax his board?
Yeah, well,

23:18.480 --> 23:19.565
you made your choice, Silver.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.399
And by the way,
it clearly wasn't me.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.527
It's not the same thing, guys.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.445
I can't figure out
how I feel about either of you

23:25.487 --> 23:28.406
until I'm sure that I'm gonna
have a baby someday, all right?

23:28.448 --> 23:29.700
And I'm sorry, Navid, but...

23:29.742 --> 23:31.244
did you really want me
to choose you

23:31.285 --> 23:32.619
just because you
would give me that?

23:32.661 --> 23:35.248
No, I wanted you to choose me,
Silver, because you love me.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.126
But you don't.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.379
Navid, don't... Navid.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.631
(phone ringing)

23:44.673 --> 23:46.300
That could be the hospital.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.844
Liam...

23:48.886 --> 23:50.846
I'm sorry.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.223
I do have feelings for you.
Yeah,

23:52.265 --> 23:53.682
feelings that you're
not sure about.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.352
You know what,
it's your life.

23:56.394 --> 23:57.477
Do what makes you happy.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.687
I want you to be happy, too.

23:58.729 --> 24:01.523
Yeah, well,
that's not really working out.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.325
It's Naomi.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.952
She and Max are in jail.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.453
SILVER:
Where are you?

24:15.495 --> 24:18.498
NAOMI:
Primm Valley Judicial Outpost,

24:18.540 --> 24:19.750
Route 15.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.711
Max and I, kind of,
sort of hitchhiked

24:22.753 --> 24:25.839
with some type of
gas station bandit,

24:25.881 --> 24:28.050
and I accidentally drove
the getaway car

24:28.092 --> 24:29.593
across state lines...

24:29.635 --> 24:31.137
so you have to
send money tonight.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.596
Hey, Naomi,
slow down, okay?

24:32.638 --> 24:34.598
We're going through a lot
over here with Dixon.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.934
They have someone here
called the "hangin' judge."

24:36.976 --> 24:38.394
Okay, you got
to help me!

24:38.436 --> 24:39.603
(dial tone drones)

24:39.645 --> 24:42.022
Silver? Silver!

24:42.064 --> 24:43.899
(dial tone drones)
The what? Hello?

24:43.941 --> 24:45.734
Oh, great, okay.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.362
Uh, I'm gonna bail out
Naomi from jail again.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.114
She's been arrested for drugs,
breaking and entering.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.490
What is she trying to do,
collect them all?

24:52.532 --> 24:53.617
Silver, I can handle Naomi.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.369
You should probably
get back to the hospital.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.079
ALEC:
Please,

24:57.121 --> 24:58.622
let me.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.040
Well, look,
I couldn't help

25:00.082 --> 25:01.375
but overhear what
you're going through

25:01.417 --> 25:03.002
with your friend
in the hospital,

25:03.043 --> 25:04.502
and I'm sorry
that I intruded on

25:04.544 --> 25:06.672
what's clearly been
a stressful day.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.924
Our company has
an army of lawyers,

25:08.966 --> 25:10.801
I can take care
of Max and Naomi

25:10.843 --> 25:11.927
with one phone call.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.346
Are you sure?

25:13.387 --> 25:15.555
You both need to be
there for your friend.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.099
Let me be there
for mine.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.725
Awesome.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.313
Thanks.
You got it.
Thank you.

25:37.495 --> 25:40.080
How is he?

25:40.122 --> 25:42.249
They're trying to stop
the internal bleeding.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.542
Oh, I am sorry

25:44.584 --> 25:46.170
I wasn't here.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.590
I wish I could take back
everything that happened,

25:50.632 --> 25:52.385
and just make him okay.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.767
All right.

26:00.809 --> 26:04.230
I don't know if this works,

26:04.271 --> 26:06.940
but...

26:06.982 --> 26:09.860
please don't take Dixon.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.321
I know...

26:12.363 --> 26:15.241
I'm supposed to believe
that there's a bigger plan,

26:15.282 --> 26:19.161
and maybe that's why
Caleb came into my life,

26:19.203 --> 26:22.373
to teach me about faith,

26:22.415 --> 26:24.875
but...

26:24.917 --> 26:27.461
I'm not like him.

26:27.503 --> 26:30.297
I need something real
to believe in,

26:30.339 --> 26:33.092
and I really need
my brother to live,

26:33.133 --> 26:36.470
because he's all
that I have right now.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.149
Annie.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.650
Mom.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.116
It's okay.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.951
It's okay.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.458
So this is what it's
like in jail, huh?

27:05.499 --> 27:07.251
They're all different.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.877
Malibu has the best view.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.882
I wanted us to be
together so badly.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.718
We are.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.888
Look, we just, we had
some bad luck, that's all.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.639
Bad luck?
Yeah.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.184
Max, we have to face the truth.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.520
Maybe our destiny isn't to make
this relationship work.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.482
Maybe it's to mess
each other's lives up.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.732
Come on, you don't know that.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.485
How many more signs do we need
that the universe

27:32.526 --> 27:34.069
wants us apart?

27:34.111 --> 27:35.237
(approaching footsteps)

27:35.279 --> 27:36.447
MAX:
You're worried over nothing.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.031
Look at this.
They're letting us out.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.450
No, we're letting
you out.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.118
The lady has to go
before the judge.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.578
What? Why?

27:42.620 --> 27:44.662
Well, we got an an anonymous
call about your criminal record.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.873
Looks like you're
what we call in Nevada

27:46.915 --> 27:48.501
a "habitual offender."

27:48.542 --> 27:50.377
W-W-Wait. Just because
Naomi's been to jail a lot,

27:50.419 --> 27:51.711
that doesn't mean
she's habitual.

27:51.753 --> 27:52.838
Yeah.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.131
Unless you're being literal.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.175
Yeah, well,
tell it to the judge.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.058
Here's yours.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.684
Oh, thanks. Maybe
a shot of caffeine

28:06.726 --> 28:09.104
will help me figure out
what time zone I'm in.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.772
ANNIE: I still
can't believe you're here.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.107
DEBBIE:
Yeah.

28:12.149 --> 28:13.651
Jen called in a favor
with a friend

28:13.691 --> 28:15.194
who has a private jet.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.070
She can be surprisingly
compassionate.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.780
Once a year or so.

28:18.822 --> 28:19.906
She's a mom, too.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.159
She knew that you
had to be here with Dixon.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.202
DEBBIE:
Yeah.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.245
You know, it's funny...

28:25.287 --> 28:27.623
you have a baby, and you're
part of that child's life

28:27.665 --> 28:30.376
24 hours a day.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.379
And then they grow up and...

28:33.420 --> 28:36.048
head into the world, and
it's your job to let them go.

28:36.089 --> 28:40.427
Because you can't always
be where they are,

28:40.469 --> 28:44.223
but, boy if ever they
need you, there's no
other place you can be.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.892
Oh, man, if Jen didn't
get me on that plane...

28:46.933 --> 28:48.310
Then you'd still be here.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.104
Yeah.
Part of you is
always with us, Mom.

28:53.691 --> 28:54.900
How is he?

28:54.941 --> 28:56.402
His condition is stable.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.611
(sighs)

28:57.653 --> 28:59.029
But he has sustained

28:59.071 --> 29:01.699
an incomplete spinal cord
injury to his neck.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.782
Which means that
his ability to walk,

29:02.824 --> 29:05.411
and the use of his hands
will be affected.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.620
You mean he's paralyzed?

29:06.662 --> 29:08.121
Well, we don't
know yet.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.832
But Dixon is alive and that's
all that matters right now.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.257
It's okay.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.551
It's gonna be okay.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.725
Alec.

29:27.766 --> 29:28.975
(sighs)

29:29.017 --> 29:31.353
The corporate helicopter
is standing by

29:31.395 --> 29:33.146
and I had your arrest record
sealed, so...

29:33.188 --> 29:34.814
good news.
We are a short flight

29:34.856 --> 29:36.567
and a tall drink away

29:36.609 --> 29:38.444
from pretending this
whole thing never happened.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.279
Um, what about Naomi?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.239
What...

29:42.281 --> 29:43.574
I did everything
I possibly could,

29:43.616 --> 29:45.325
but the police knew
about her criminal record

29:45.367 --> 29:46.619
before I got here.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.372
Naomi Clark's past speaks
for itself, Max.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.998
In more ways than one.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.208
What does that mean?

29:53.250 --> 29:54.293
It means she broke your heart

29:54.334 --> 29:55.961
and now she's getting
what she deserves.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.172
What does this chick do,

29:59.214 --> 30:00.549
hypnotize you?

30:00.591 --> 30:02.718
First semester freshman year,

30:02.760 --> 30:04.678
all you did was watch
Star Trek and cry,

30:04.720 --> 30:06.179
"Naomi was my Uhura."

30:07.598 --> 30:09.516
Yeah, okay, I was upset.

30:09.558 --> 30:10.434
No, heartbroken.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.893
And then she
took you back,

30:11.935 --> 30:14.605
cheated on you with that cowboy.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.899
If you get back
together with her,

30:17.941 --> 30:19.693
she will break your heart again.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.654
Now I'm-I'm begging you.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.657
Don't keep
making the same mistake.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.286
You're right.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.504
Max.

30:38.545 --> 30:39.879
Ms. Clark...
NAOMI: First of all,

30:39.921 --> 30:41.089
the drug thing last year,
not my pot.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.509
Which I tried to explain
to the Secret Service Agent

30:43.550 --> 30:45.885
who detained me
for breaking into my own house.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.179
And secondly,

30:47.220 --> 30:49.931
I was not trying to rob
that adult toy store.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.350
I was helping my sister,

30:51.391 --> 30:54.102
who had no idea she was on
a date with a married man.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.979
And I paid
for every one of those toys,

30:56.021 --> 30:58.064
and I have the receipt.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.817
The defense rests.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.861
Ms. Clark,
you may want to consider

31:02.902 --> 31:05.113
allowing the court
to appoint an attorney for you.

31:05.155 --> 31:07.449
Uh, may, Your Honor,

31:07.491 --> 31:10.494
I would like to speak
on Ms. Clark's behalf.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.662
I'm sorry, you are?

31:11.704 --> 31:13.913
I'm, uh, a character
witness, who was also

31:13.955 --> 31:15.374
in the car.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.916
Naomi's a good person

31:16.958 --> 31:18.794
who was just caught
in a bad situation.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.253
JUDGE:
Well, that may be,

31:20.295 --> 31:22.422
but that's not a legal defense.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.216
Uh, what about intent?

31:24.257 --> 31:25.801
Naomi didn't intend
to drive that car.

31:25.843 --> 31:26.926
The only reason

31:26.968 --> 31:29.054
that we were hitchhiking
in a stolen car

31:29.095 --> 31:30.222
full of drugs...

31:30.263 --> 31:33.350
was, well, so we
could get married

31:33.392 --> 31:35.310
and prove that we
were meant to be together.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.730
That was Naomi's intent.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.064
I mean,
we're not perfect.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.400
We, we make mistakes and we
mess up each other's lives,

31:41.441 --> 31:44.194
but I think
that the biggest mistake

31:44.236 --> 31:45.863
would be not to try
something new.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.698
I mean, we've

31:47.740 --> 31:50.743
never really fought
for our relationship.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.953
That's what we were trying to
do and that can't be a crime.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.752
I love you,
Max Miller.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.670
I'll write you every
day from prison.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.338
JUDGE:
You won't have to.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.383
$200 fine for the speeding

32:06.425 --> 32:09.094
and $60
for the marriage license.

32:09.135 --> 32:10.345
I happen
to perform

32:10.387 --> 32:12.013
a very poetic ceremony

32:12.055 --> 32:13.640
if you still want
to get married.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.351
(chuckles)

32:16.393 --> 32:17.310
(laughs)

32:17.352 --> 32:18.978
Yeah.
Yes.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.690
Last call.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.817
You had enough?

32:23.859 --> 32:25.151
Hell, no.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.404
Why did you only
get one bottle?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.239
It's not like we have
to share everything.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.617
'Cause I could
only afford one.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.494
I put the bar up for sale,

32:34.536 --> 32:35.954
and according
to the real estate agent,

32:35.995 --> 32:39.958
I got one offer for half
of what I paid for it.

32:39.999 --> 32:42.252
Dude, why are you
selling the bar?

32:42.294 --> 32:44.212
'Cause I thought,
for once in my life,

32:44.254 --> 32:46.840
the girl that I wanted
would actually choose me.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.927
So far that
was a big joke.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.345
Yeah, the joke's
on me, too, bro.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.513
(chuckling):
Yeah.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.724
I've been a good guy,
I did all the right things,

32:55.766 --> 32:57.434
but what do I have?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.185
Squat.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.814
Only I didn't get to drop
out of school, buy a bar,

33:01.855 --> 33:03.482
and have sex with
some other guy's girlfriend.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.358
Silver was not
your girlfriend.

33:06.902 --> 33:09.488
Still, I shouldn't
have gone there.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.825
But I swear, I will never let
a girl come

33:12.866 --> 33:14.952
between me and a friend again.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.751
Bro code.

33:29.090 --> 33:32.051
(sighs)

33:32.093 --> 33:34.930
I think I have to make
a baby with Silver.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.560
I'm happy for you.
Go for it, man.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.020
Look, you guys
don't have to pretend

33:42.061 --> 33:43.229
like you're happy
about it.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.565
I'm not even sure
I'm happy about it.

33:45.607 --> 33:46.608
Then, why

33:46.650 --> 33:48.318
are you impregnating
my ex-girlfriend?

33:48.360 --> 33:49.402
'Cause I just spent the day

33:49.444 --> 33:51.112
at the hospital
and the morgue, man.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.907
I mean, life is short.

33:56.075 --> 34:00.038
Silver needs this,
she needs me.

34:00.079 --> 34:05.544
You're a better man
than me... Dad.

34:05.585 --> 34:10.007
Hey, it's your choice,
Teddy, it is your choice.

34:10.047 --> 34:15.053
As for me, I'm done being the
nice guy that finishes last.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.139
I'm a hot,
young, rich...

34:18.181 --> 34:19.975
Drunk.
...superstar.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.895
If Silver doesn't appreciate me,
then I'll-I'll find one

34:22.936 --> 34:27.983
or several women... who do.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.320
I got it.

34:32.362 --> 34:35.489
Okay, superstar, let's,
let's get you some coffee.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.367
The visiting hours at the
hospital will be open soon.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.411
Thank you.
You coming?

34:40.453 --> 34:43.248
I'll catch up.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.833
Liam, it's going to be okay.

34:45.876 --> 34:47.920
Silver's not the only girl
in the world.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.756
Yeah,

37:37.797 --> 37:40.759
I could invest some cash,
well, as a sort of

37:40.800 --> 37:42.094
a managing partner.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.302

Boyfriend, really?

Yeah, he was
in a really bad car accident.

Ade's going to be thinking

38:47.993 --> 38:50.203
Maybe I shouldn't have.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.372
