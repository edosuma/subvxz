of you know,

Lisa and I met on a blind
date three years ago.

00:13.997 --> 00:15.848
I still remember walking
her to her car that night.

00:17.593 --> 00:21.745
I had this odd feeling I
was going to marry her.

00:21.764 --> 00:23.522
When you know,
you know, right?

00:26.009 --> 00:30.529
As I stand here today,
I am a broken man.

00:30.606 --> 00:32.698
My better half is gone.

00:35.185 --> 00:36.869
And Madison's mother's gone.

00:36.945 --> 00:38.871
¶

00:39.022 --> 00:40.706
She loved being your mother
more than anything

00:42.618 --> 00:43.959
Please know that.

night before Valentine's?

01:20.063 --> 01:22.472

01:22.491 --> 01:25.642
Desperate? Claire, it's
GALENTINE'S, as in,

01:25.661 --> 01:28.587
a night for us GALS to
own our independence.

01:28.664 --> 01:31.148
And who needs a guy
to have fun anyway?

01:31.166 --> 01:33.258
Well, I wouldn't mind
one once in a while

01:33.335 --> 01:35.427
to go to dinner
and a movie with.

01:35.504 --> 01:37.487
Someone who treats
me with respect.

01:37.489 --> 01:39.765
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

01:39.916 --> 01:42.159
It's been over a year and I
haven't gone on one date yet.

01:42.177 --> 01:43.769

living again.

new attitude.

01:46.849 --> 01:48.941
So, how'd you find
out about this place

01:49.017 --> 01:50.500
we're going to, anyway?

01:50.519 --> 01:51.835
-I got a DM
from them.

01:51.854 --> 01:54.113
Apparently, it got a new
owner and a makeover.

01:54.264 --> 01:56.281
Sounds like another
reason to celebrate to me!

stay out too late.

01:58.193 --> 01:59.451

Well, she's gonna love
you, you know why?

02:10.780 --> 02:12.464
Because you're great
at what you do. 'K?

02:12.541 --> 02:14.133
So, you're gonna walk
in there tomorrow

02:14.284 --> 02:15.384

'Cause you slayed
that idiot.

03:10.265 --> 03:13.025

on every girl in here.

Oh no, I think
she's right.

03:44.132 --> 03:45.224
Yeah. You're a
hot commodity.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.558
OK. Claire,
admit it.

Totally.

it right now.

And I should
get going.

Uh, no, no! Wait
until we get back.

with names or...

04:57.113 --> 04:58.463
I made an impression.

04:58.615 --> 05:00.632
Well, maybe it was a
little bit of both.

05:00.784 --> 05:02.968
All right, well,
I'll take it.

05:03.119 --> 05:05.304
So, Claire. What do
you do for a living?

05:05.455 --> 05:09.975
I'm a designer. Uh,
high-end sportswear.

05:10.126 --> 05:11.476
And what do you do?

05:11.628 --> 05:13.370
Oh, I'm in... in sales.

05:13.388 --> 05:17.983
Hmm. And are you...
originally from Philly?

05:18.060 --> 05:20.544
No, actually,
uh, Atlanta.

05:20.562 --> 05:21.711
So, what do you
think of this place?

05:21.730 --> 05:24.064
It's got a really
good vibe.

05:24.974 --> 05:27.159
Then can I show
you something cool?

05:27.235 --> 05:29.386
Uh... my friends are...

05:29.404 --> 05:30.996
Ah, come on, just
five minutes.

05:31.147 --> 05:32.998
I promise I'll have
you back, all right?

05:33.149 --> 05:34.499
OK. Five minutes.

05:45.087 --> 05:46.845
Yeah.

05:46.996 --> 05:49.181
Are we even
allowed up here?

05:49.257 --> 05:51.016
Oh, it's fine. I
know the owner.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.351
He's actually going to
use this as part

05:52.427 --> 05:53.518
of the restaurant.

05:53.670 --> 05:54.519
What a great idea.

05:54.596 --> 05:56.188
Yeah.

05:56.264 --> 05:59.249
You know, sometimes
you just gotta stop ...

05:59.267 --> 06:01.443
and appreciate the
little things, right?

06:02.604 --> 06:04.112
I couldn't
agree more.

06:05.941 --> 06:07.699
I lost my wife a
couple of years ago,

06:07.851 --> 06:09.593
so now I don't take
anything for granted.

06:09.595 --> 06:11.928
I am so sorry.

06:11.947 --> 06:13.705
It got a little
easier with time.

06:13.782 --> 06:15.857
Friends tell me I need
to get out there again

06:15.876 --> 06:17.709
and go on dates.

06:17.861 --> 06:20.879
Well, mine tell
me the same thing.

06:20.956 --> 06:24.608
That all I care about is work
and working out so...

06:24.626 --> 06:26.885
Well, I happen
to, uh, love work,

06:27.036 --> 06:29.221
and I can't function
without my daily run.

06:29.372 --> 06:30.722
Where do you run?

06:30.874 --> 06:32.616
Oh, just around
the neighborhood. You?

06:32.634 --> 06:34.117
Briarwood Park.

06:34.119 --> 06:36.453
The trails are rugged;
it's super isolated.

06:36.471 --> 06:38.563
It's Philly's
best kept secret.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.124
Nice. I'll definitely
have to check it out.

Hey, will you
look at that, 12:01.

06:45.722 --> 06:46.738
Mmm.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.298
I guess I'm officially
your Valentine

06:48.316 --> 06:50.133
by sheer
proximity alone.

06:50.152 --> 06:52.135
I guess you are, Brian.

06:52.154 --> 06:55.247
I'm sorry I don't have
any flowers or chocolates.

06:55.398 --> 06:57.082
It's a... little
last-minute.

06:57.233 --> 07:01.645
Well, sometimes spontaneity
is the best gift.

07:01.647 --> 07:04.314
That's a really cool
way to look at things.

Mm hmm.

07:13.082 --> 07:14.266

she left.

with Mr. Forever.

07:17.921 --> 07:19.187
Or not.

07:20.849 --> 07:21.773
Yeah?

I feel this instant
connection with you, Claire.

get back to my friends.

Oh, my friends
must've left.

All right.

over here.

didn't leave before you.

13:27.549 --> 13:29.140
What do you mean?

13:29.217 --> 13:32.626
I was with the
drinks guy, Brian.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.978
Really.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.146
He's nice.

13:35.298 --> 13:37.816
Mm hmm. And?

13:37.967 --> 13:39.651
He, uh,...

13:39.727 --> 13:40.819
(whispers) came
home with me.

Oh, my God!

Shh!

13:43.306 --> 13:44.213
Maybe I
shouldn't have.

13:44.215 --> 13:45.323
Why not?

13:45.474 --> 13:48.217
I mean, he's handsome,
seemed really nice.

13:48.219 --> 13:50.328
Clearly a professional and
you haven't been with a guy

13:50.479 --> 13:51.478
in forever.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.057
Thanks, Tiff. I
guess you're right.

13:54.075 --> 13:55.725
I know I'm right.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.560
So, are you gonna
see him again?

I'm glad to hear that.

14:21.177 --> 14:23.753
I was very impressed by that
floral line you created.

14:23.771 --> 14:26.589
You seem to have a different
eye from everyone else here.

14:26.608 --> 14:29.367

I'd love to know what
other ideas you have.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.187
Tons.

14:33.264 --> 14:35.206
And I want to learn as
much as I can from you too.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.374
Well, that's great.

14:36.525 --> 14:38.710
We need a younger
perspective around here.

You know what?

14:41.530 --> 14:43.214
Would you like to join
me for lunch today?

14:43.366 --> 14:44.774
Of course.

Thank you, Ms. Coleman.

14:46.202 --> 14:47.627
Oh please, Margaret.

you'll bring to the brand.

Lunch with Margaret is at
City Bistro 215 at noon.

Hm, what a
coincidence.

15:20.569 --> 15:21.494

Ah. Claire!

15:43.426 --> 15:44.609
What brings
you back here?

15:44.760 --> 15:47.503
I am meeting someone.
What're you doing here?

15:47.522 --> 15:49.614
I have a confession
to make.

15:49.765 --> 15:50.615
I own the restaurant.

15:50.766 --> 15:52.784
You said that
your friend did.

15:52.935 --> 15:54.786
I know. I was just
wanting to have fun

15:54.862 --> 15:56.345
like everyone
else last night

15:56.364 --> 15:58.514
and we were so
in the moment.

15:58.533 --> 15:59.273
I'm sorry.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.792
It's OK.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.627
Thank you for the
chocolates, by the way.

16:02.778 --> 16:04.462
Where'd you get them in
the middle of the night?

16:04.539 --> 16:07.131
Oh, I know a little 24-hour
bodega near your place.

16:07.208 --> 16:08.967
I slipped out and
slipped back in.

16:09.118 --> 16:10.359
Mmm.

You know, you are
beautiful when you sleep.

That would be nice.

Sorry, I didn't
make a reservation

16:23.224 --> 16:24.540
not that I
need one.

16:24.559 --> 16:25.817
I see you've already
met my husband.

16:25.893 --> 16:28.319
Brian, this is
Claire Donahue.

16:28.396 --> 16:30.046
Nice to meet
you, Claire.

16:30.064 --> 16:32.048
Mm hmm.

16:32.066 --> 16:33.216
Now, if you don't
like something,

you know who to
complain to.

Thanks, sweetie.

Hey. Wait, where's
your wedding ring?

16:38.981 --> 16:40.999
Huh? Oh, I was cooking
and took it off.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.335
I'll be right back, OK?

16:47.156 --> 16:48.506
All right. Come,
have a seat.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.345
So, tell me.

16:54.422 --> 16:55.513
Do you have a
special someone

16:55.664 --> 16:58.016
to celebrate
Valentine's Day with?

16:58.167 --> 17:00.409
You know, I thought
I did but, no.

17:00.428 --> 17:02.353
Well, don't wait too
long to settle down.

17:02.430 --> 17:04.747
I was very focused
on my career

17:04.766 --> 17:06.432
and then I got
married pretty quick.

17:06.584 --> 17:08.026
Never thought it'd
happen, actually.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.254
Claire?

17:11.272 --> 17:14.090
Yes. Sorry, I just, I
have a bit of a headache.

shock, I can barely remember.

Wow.

Nobody had the
decency to tell her.

She could've left
him years earlier.

what's bothering you?

24:28.617 --> 24:30.359
It's just one
of those days.

24:30.361 --> 24:31.802
[phone chimes]

24:38.961 --> 24:42.037
Mom: And how was your night
out with Tiffany and Sophia?

24:42.056 --> 24:43.539
What do you girls
call it again?

24:43.541 --> 24:45.149
Uh, Galentine's.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.375
It was OK.

24:46.393 --> 24:48.711
-Just OK? Did you
meet anyone?

24:48.729 --> 24:52.548
No, Mom. It's a
night for the gals.

24:52.550 --> 24:55.159
Besides, I thought that I
was ready to put myself

24:55.310 --> 24:57.553
out there again,
but I'm not.

24:57.571 --> 24:59.497
Tsk, tsk, tsk, lying
to Mom, Claire.

24:59.648 --> 25:01.223
But you've been
doing great.

25:01.242 --> 25:02.833
Well, apparently the
universe doesn't believe

25:02.910 --> 25:04.835
that I deserve
happiness so...

25:04.987 --> 25:07.671
Hey, where's this coming from?

25:08.824 --> 25:10.174
Did something happen?

25:11.344 --> 25:15.012
No. It's just it's not easy
being out there again.

25:15.089 --> 25:18.682
You have to stop
beating yourself up.

25:18.834 --> 25:22.186
What happened to
Mark was an accident.

25:23.931 --> 25:25.189
It's over, Mark!

25:25.340 --> 25:26.506
Can we please
talk about this?

25:26.584 --> 25:28.083
It seemed like all you
wanted to do was talk

25:28.102 --> 25:28.859
to that waitress!

25:29.011 --> 25:30.027
You haven't changed.

25:31.346 --> 25:32.254
Leave me alone!

25:32.256 --> 25:34.757
(gasp) Mark! No!

25:34.759 --> 25:36.367
Mark! Wake up!

25:36.443 --> 25:38.285
Mark! Somebody help me!

25:40.281 --> 25:42.097
I killed him, Mom.

25:42.116 --> 25:45.709
Ooh, you are a
troubled girl, Claire.

25:45.861 --> 25:48.212
Mom: It was an ACCIDENT.

25:48.363 --> 25:50.714
And he put you in that
position by cheating on you

25:50.866 --> 25:52.049
so many times.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.384
He made your life hell.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.219
Like, Dad did to yours?

25:55.370 --> 25:59.723
Hey, we've both worked to
put the past behind us.

25:59.875 --> 26:01.392
Well, it's hard, Mom.

26:03.045 --> 26:04.895
Mom: Maybe you should think
about starting therapy again.

26:05.047 --> 26:06.230
-I don't need therapy.

26:06.381 --> 26:07.731
-Well, what about going
back on your meds?

26:07.808 --> 26:09.733
I worked really hard
to get off them.

26:09.885 --> 26:12.069
Yes, but if they help?

26:12.146 --> 26:14.738
I'd feel like I'd be
taking a step backwards.

26:16.892 --> 26:20.302
Well, can I make
dinner for you tonight?

26:20.321 --> 26:21.579
I'll cook lasagna,
your favorite.

26:21.655 --> 26:23.138
Mm, I'm just
really not hungry.

26:23.157 --> 26:24.248
[inhale]

26:24.399 --> 26:26.975
I'm just gonna go for
a run in the park

26:26.994 --> 26:28.586

work; clear my head.

You scared me.

27:16.785 --> 27:18.527
Oh, sorry, I didn't think
anyone would be out here

27:18.545 --> 27:20.137
running in the
middle of the day.

27:20.288 --> 27:21.213
Why are you?

27:21.365 --> 27:22.473
Well, you made the
park sound so great,

27:22.549 --> 27:24.032
I decided to check
it out for myself.

27:24.051 --> 27:25.701
Oh.

27:25.719 --> 27:27.478
Shouldn't you
be at work?

27:27.554 --> 27:31.482
Ah, I needed a
mental health break.

27:31.633 --> 27:33.484
Trust me,
I get it.

27:33.635 --> 27:34.151

27:34.302 --> 27:36.211
I don't know, I...

27:36.213 --> 27:37.546
Just as friends.

gonna be the best run

27:40.551 --> 27:42.660

armchair therapist.

27:42.811 --> 27:47.164
(laughs) OK.

27:47.241 --> 27:48.832
But you're gonna have
to catch me first.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.003
Oh, don't worry,
I will!

27:56.158 --> 27:57.399
You'd better be
quicker than that.

27:57.401 --> 27:58.324
I'm lightning.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.343
I'm catching up!

28:01.588 --> 28:03.739
So, what was her
main course, water?

28:03.757 --> 28:06.909
(laughs) Well, I
finally told her...

28:06.927 --> 28:10.437
we have some nice gluten-free
Styrofoam in the back.

28:11.765 --> 28:12.189
You did not.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.023
I did.

28:13.175 --> 28:15.359
(laughs)

28:15.510 --> 28:18.696
(sigh) You know,
I love it when you smile.

28:18.772 --> 28:20.197
Hm.

28:20.348 --> 28:21.699
I haven't been doing
a lot of that lately.

28:24.519 --> 28:28.096
(sigh) You should know, uh,

28:28.115 --> 28:30.374
Margaret got the divorce
paperwork today.

28:30.525 --> 28:32.876
Oh.

28:33.028 --> 28:34.545
You know, I saw
her earlier.

28:34.621 --> 28:36.380
She looked upset.

28:36.531 --> 28:37.439
Is that why?

28:37.441 --> 28:38.457
Yeah.

28:38.609 --> 28:40.050
I think it's just
the finality of it.

28:40.202 --> 28:41.610
Hm.

28:41.628 --> 28:43.111
I'm surprised she
was in at all.

28:43.130 --> 28:44.555
She said she wanted
to take her mind

28:44.706 --> 28:45.889
off of everything.

28:47.968 --> 28:49.893
Hey, listen. She
and I both hate

28:50.045 --> 28:52.229
that we couldn't
make it work.

28:52.306 --> 28:54.231
But it's the
right thing to do.

28:54.382 --> 28:55.958
Doesn't make it
any easier though.

28:55.976 --> 28:58.460
You can't beat
yourself up.

28:58.479 --> 29:00.887
Sometimes things
just don't work out.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.740
Thanks.

29:02.891 --> 29:04.074
I think I'm the
one that needed

29:04.226 --> 29:04.983
the mental
health break.

29:05.135 --> 29:06.577
[soft laughs]

29:08.155 --> 29:09.413
So, did you
move out yet?

29:09.564 --> 29:11.807
No. It's a, it's
a big house.

29:11.809 --> 29:14.752
Margaret told me I could
stay until I find a place.

29:14.903 --> 29:16.003
She's a good woman.

29:18.073 --> 29:20.591
I probably should
head home.

29:20.667 --> 29:23.927
OK. I'll walk you
to your car?

29:24.079 --> 29:24.928
OK.

that for you.

You know, every
time I kiss you...

29:41.429 --> 29:43.447
I feel like I'm the luckiest
man in the whole world.

29:45.267 --> 29:46.599
So what do you think?

29:46.677 --> 29:48.786
Could we go out sometime on
a real date, take it slow?

29:48.937 --> 29:51.622
Now that all of this
is out in the open?

29:52.941 --> 29:55.292
I, uh...

29:55.369 --> 29:57.185

some more time.

I'm not sure, but I heard
her friend's husband died.

31:14.948 --> 31:17.708
Probably why she looked
so upset yesterday.

31:17.859 --> 31:19.042
I thought it was
because she got served

31:19.194 --> 31:20.210
the divorce papers.

31:22.364 --> 31:24.381
Are you talking to
her husband again?

Yeah. I saw him
in the park.

31:26.126 --> 31:28.886
He said that they've
agreed on the terms.

out with him?

bumped into each other.

36:59.125 --> 37:00.717
And what happened to her,

37:00.868 --> 37:02.552
it has nothing to do
with you, right?

37:02.704 --> 37:05.280
Oh, but it does,
but it does.

37:05.282 --> 37:07.057
[small laugh]

37:07.208 --> 37:10.894
Claire: He told me that he
felt an instant connection.

37:11.045 --> 37:13.563
My judgement fails me again.

37:13.640 --> 37:14.789
Hm.

37:14.791 --> 37:17.125
[phone chimes]

37:17.127 --> 37:18.568
Anna: Who is it?

37:18.720 --> 37:20.237
Tiffany.

37:20.388 --> 37:23.406
She says the police want to
talk to everyone tomorrow.

37:23.558 --> 37:24.908
She wants to meet up.

37:24.985 --> 37:27.410
Oh, we should just drown
our sorrows in wine.

37:27.487 --> 37:30.305
Coffee is probably
a better choice.

37:30.307 --> 37:31.806
[phone chimes]

37:31.808 --> 37:34.251
We're gonna meet at
the Ground Bean at 8.

37:34.402 --> 37:37.337
OK, it looks like I'll meet
you ladies at the coffee shop.

37:44.263 --> 37:48.265
[door opens and closes]

37:52.178 --> 37:53.270
Hey, girl.

37:53.346 --> 37:54.604
Hey.

37:54.681 --> 37:56.273
How are you
feeling?

37:56.424 --> 37:58.108
A little on
edge. You?

37:58.259 --> 38:00.110
Yeah. Pretty
much the same.

38:00.261 --> 38:02.028
No one I know has
ever been murdered.

38:04.024 --> 38:05.782
Come on. Let's go.

38:05.933 --> 38:09.953
[footsteps]

¶ [eerie] ¶

38:13.533 --> 38:20.463
¶¶

38:20.615 --> 38:24.692
Seriously? You need
to stop following me!

38:24.711 --> 38:26.636
I told you,
Leave me alone!

38:26.713 --> 38:27.804
What are you
talking about?

38:27.955 --> 38:29.531
-I don't know what else
I can say to you

38:29.549 --> 38:30.473
to make you understand.

38:30.625 --> 38:32.142
I want nothing to do with you.

38:32.293 --> 38:33.535
I am not following you.

38:33.553 --> 38:35.145
Oh, so it's a coincidence
you keep showing up

38:35.296 --> 38:36.646
wherever I am! Is
that how that works?

38:36.798 --> 38:37.705
Why are you doing
this to me?

38:37.724 --> 38:38.732
To you?

38:40.968 --> 38:42.485
Be careful.

38:42.562 --> 38:44.404
This one is a real psycho.

38:45.732 --> 38:47.157
You know what?

38:47.308 --> 38:52.478
If you won't leave,
it's fine; I will.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.164
(sigh) My God.

38:57.819 --> 38:59.502
OK, what was
that all about?

38:59.579 --> 39:00.728
I don't know.
This is the

39:00.747 --> 39:02.005
second time
that he's done this.

39:02.156 --> 39:03.840
Done what?

39:05.159 --> 39:07.510
Acted like I'm crazy.

39:07.662 --> 39:09.429
Yeah. OK.
Sit here.

39:16.838 --> 39:18.188
Do you wanna know
the really bad thing

39:18.339 --> 39:19.856
that happened
last night?

39:19.933 --> 39:22.692
What?

39:22.769 --> 39:25.086
I went to his
restaurant to talk.

39:25.105 --> 39:27.530
Only, he made it seem
like I was stalking him.

39:27.607 --> 39:28.865
He is messing
with me, Tiffany.

39:29.016 --> 39:30.425
And I don't know why.

39:30.443 --> 39:32.869
How would he even know you
were going to be here, though?

39:33.020 --> 39:35.205
Beats me. But, obviously,
I didn't follow him!

39:38.860 --> 39:40.210
Claire.

39:40.361 --> 39:42.545
Your mom called me
a little while ago.

39:42.697 --> 39:45.382
She's worried about you.

39:45.458 --> 39:49.052
She thinks maybe you should
go back on your medication.

39:49.203 --> 39:52.055
(scoff) I gotta go.

39:52.132 --> 39:53.281
We just want
to help you!

You're not crazy.

The detective's
interviewing everybody

40:50.356 --> 40:51.865
in the conference room.

40:54.360 --> 40:58.037
Hey, she just wants to
know if we saw anything.

40:59.607 --> 41:00.439
I already
talked to her.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.624
The questions
were routine.

41:01.776 --> 41:02.959
There's nothing
to worry about.

41:03.870 --> 41:05.044
Claire Donahue?

41:07.373 --> 41:08.856
Claire Donahue?

41:08.875 --> 41:11.885
[rushing sound]

41:13.120 --> 41:13.970
Thank you.

41:16.382 --> 41:17.474
[door closes]

41:17.550 --> 41:20.310
[echo] It was an
accident. He fell.

41:20.386 --> 41:22.479
You have to believe
me. I swear.

41:22.630 --> 41:24.372
Female detective: Thank you
for making the time.

41:24.390 --> 41:25.315
This'll be quick.

41:25.466 --> 41:26.874
No problem.

41:26.876 --> 41:29.986
Have you seen anyone
suspicious hanging around

41:30.137 --> 41:32.489
in the parking lot?
Any strange cars?

41:32.565 --> 41:34.657
No.

41:34.809 --> 41:37.494
Have you or your colleagues
had any problems with anyone?

41:37.645 --> 41:39.662
Had anything
stolen recently?

41:39.814 --> 41:41.998
Uh, not that
I'm aware of.

41:42.149 --> 41:45.835
Generally, we feel pretty
safe around here...

41:45.987 --> 41:48.062
until now, of course.

41:48.081 --> 41:49.897
How well did you know
Margaret Coleman?

41:49.916 --> 41:52.400
Not very, she only just
bought the company.

41:52.402 --> 41:55.428
So you haven't heard of
anything going on in her life?

41:56.256 --> 41:57.680
What do you mean?

42:00.093 --> 42:01.267
Did she seem OK?

42:02.929 --> 42:06.581
Like I said, I didn't
know her very well.

42:06.599 --> 42:08.082
Do you think that this
could be connected

42:08.101 --> 42:09.692
to the other
muggings downtown?

42:09.844 --> 42:10.768
It could be.

42:10.920 --> 42:11.861
We can't say for sure.

42:12.013 --> 42:13.363
Did you get any
security camera video?

42:13.439 --> 42:14.697
I can't answer any
questions about

42:14.849 --> 42:17.033
an ongoing
investigation, but

42:17.110 --> 42:20.036
I can assure you we're
doing all that we can.

42:20.113 --> 42:23.522
Please give me a call
if you hear anything,

42:23.542 --> 42:26.209
or remember something
that could be relevant.

42:26.286 --> 42:34.050
¶

42:34.127 --> 42:35.200
Hey.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.053
Everything OK?

42:37.130 --> 42:39.055
Seems to me like they
think it's a robbery.

42:39.132 --> 42:41.140
See, I told you
it'd be fine.

42:42.802 --> 42:44.285
So, what's going to
happen to the company?

42:44.304 --> 42:46.729
I guess it depends on who
Margaret left it to

42:46.881 --> 42:47.730
in her will.

42:48.641 --> 42:50.124
Do you know?

42:50.126 --> 42:51.401
No idea.

42:53.387 --> 42:55.146
So, what, are we just
supposed to keep working?

42:55.298 --> 42:57.632
Yeah. The VPs are
taking over for now

42:57.650 --> 42:59.967
until we're given our
marching orders so...

42:59.969 --> 43:04.414
[phone rings]

43:04.490 --> 43:06.416
Detective: Hello.

43:07.660 --> 43:10.420
Absolutely. Right away.

[conversation buzz]

43:20.340 --> 43:21.672
"Police sources
say the murder weapon

43:21.749 --> 43:24.659
has been located in
the death of wealthy designer,

43:24.677 --> 43:26.160
Margaret Coleman.

43:26.179 --> 43:29.439
It's unclear what weapon was
used or where it was found."

43:40.768 --> 43:42.619
Claire! Did you hear?

43:42.770 --> 43:45.788
-Yeah. I just saw. They
found the murder weapon.

43:45.865 --> 43:47.957
-Yeah, a letter opener.

43:48.109 --> 43:49.292
-What? From where?

43:49.443 --> 43:50.960
Apparently, the cops
think it's the one

43:51.112 --> 43:52.962
from the copy room at work.

43:53.114 --> 43:54.631
Margaret's assistant
was working late

43:54.782 --> 43:56.966
and said the
detectives came back.

43:57.118 --> 44:00.119
I mean, this might not have
been a robbery, after all.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.696
-But who would want
to do this from work?

44:01.714 --> 44:03.364
She just bought
the company.

44:03.366 --> 44:06.200
- No clue. But she says
the police want to

44:06.202 --> 44:08.369
interview everyone again
and take our prints.

44:08.388 --> 44:10.146
- Really?

44:10.297 --> 44:12.482
- Yeah, I mean, I'm
not surprised.

44:12.558 --> 44:13.816
I'll see you at
work tomorrow.

44:13.893 --> 44:15.393
You're gonna be
there, right?

44:15.545 --> 44:19.322
(sighs) Yeah. Sure.

44:19.473 --> 44:21.824
Claire. Everything's
gonna be fine.

44:21.976 --> 44:22.992
I gotta go.

44:23.144 --> 44:26.554
(ragged
breathing)

is going on?

44:40.161 --> 44:41.511
Tracking me, Claire?

44:41.587 --> 44:42.512
What, are you a psycho?

44:56.436 --> 44:58.361
In light of our
new discovery,

44:58.512 --> 45:01.698
can you run through your
timeline again?

45:01.774 --> 45:03.107
Yeah.

45:03.184 --> 45:06.427
Uh, as I've stated, I was in
my office doing paperwork.

45:06.446 --> 45:08.763
You saw the
surveillance video.

45:08.781 --> 45:10.873
I went home after the
restaurant closed.

45:11.025 --> 45:13.710
I fell asleep watching the
news in the living room.

45:13.861 --> 45:15.378
And, uh, when I woke up,
I assumed Margaret

45:15.529 --> 45:17.547
was at her morning
yoga class.

45:17.698 --> 45:18.940
I went to my workout,

45:18.958 --> 45:21.200
and that's when I got
the call from you.

45:22.369 --> 45:24.470
What was your relationship
like with your wife?

45:25.798 --> 45:28.891
I wanna be totally
honest with you.

45:29.043 --> 45:31.060
I was considering
getting a divorce.

45:31.212 --> 45:32.954
I even met with
an attorney.

45:32.972 --> 45:34.789
Name?

45:34.791 --> 45:36.215
Gerald Parsing.

45:36.234 --> 45:38.067
I told him I didn't want
anything from my wife

45:38.219 --> 45:40.403
except to keep
the restaurant.

45:40.554 --> 45:42.739
I was planning to take
over the mortgage payments.

45:42.890 --> 45:44.574
What was the problem
with your marriage?

45:44.725 --> 45:46.817
We were both focused
too much on work.

45:46.970 --> 45:48.803
Oh, and you
should also know.

45:48.805 --> 45:51.914
I, uh, spent the night with
someone a few nights ago.

45:53.326 --> 45:54.900
Name?

45:54.919 --> 45:56.310
Claire Donahue.

45:56.329 --> 45:58.254
She actually worked
for Margaret.

45:58.405 --> 45:59.814
And how did
you meet her?

45:59.832 --> 46:01.591
At my restaurant.

46:01.742 --> 46:03.242
Have you seen
her since?

46:03.261 --> 46:07.597
Yes. But not because
I wanted to. She's been...

46:07.748 --> 46:08.990
stalking me.

46:09.993 --> 46:12.602
She came by my restaurant
unannounced uh,

46:12.753 --> 46:15.271
and then showed up at the
park while I was there.

46:15.422 --> 46:16.606
Oh, and somehow,
she found me

46:16.757 --> 46:19.108
at a coffee shop
two nights ago.

46:19.185 --> 46:21.002
Name of this
coffee shop?

46:21.004 --> 46:22.111
The Ground Bean.

46:22.188 --> 46:23.671
It's been escalating
with her and,

46:23.673 --> 46:25.339
and I know I should've
said something earlier,

46:25.358 --> 46:28.451
but I thought this
was a robbery.

46:28.602 --> 46:29.952
Do you have any proof

46:30.029 --> 46:32.288
of what you're accusing
Ms. Donahue of?

46:32.439 --> 46:34.682
Well, my hostess saw
her at the restaurant.

46:34.700 --> 46:36.459
Actually, she
called the police.

46:36.610 --> 46:39.020
Um, and one of
Claire's friends, uh,

46:39.038 --> 46:40.963
was at the coffee
place with her.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.523
Do you know the
name of this friend?

46:42.542 --> 46:43.966
Stephanie?

46:44.118 --> 46:46.302
Maybe Tiffany, I, I
only met her once.

46:46.379 --> 46:47.804
Does Claire know you
were thinking about

46:47.880 --> 46:49.196
getting a divorce
from your wife?

46:49.215 --> 46:51.641
Yes. I told her the
first night we met.

46:51.717 --> 46:54.035
Then what could
her motive be?

46:54.037 --> 46:56.729
If she had something to
do with your wife's death?

46:59.058 --> 47:02.543
When Claire found
me in the park,

47:02.562 --> 47:04.879
I told her I was
rethinking the divorce.

47:04.897 --> 47:08.324
The whole one-night-stand,
it, uh, had left me...

47:08.475 --> 47:09.884
sort of empty.

47:09.886 --> 47:12.328
And Margaret wanted to
give us another shot.

47:12.479 --> 47:14.831
Claire didn't take it well.

47:14.982 --> 47:16.499
I have text messages.

47:21.247 --> 47:22.755
Uh. Here.

47:30.998 --> 47:32.348
Kim: Do you believe him?

47:32.499 --> 47:34.183
Those texts were
pretty bad,

47:34.260 --> 47:36.077
and you saw the
surveillance video.

47:36.079 --> 47:38.187
He was in his office and his
car was in the parking lot

47:38.264 --> 47:39.522
at the time she was killed.

47:39.673 --> 47:40.857
Pretty solid alibi.

47:41.008 --> 47:42.358
Yeah, but you know
as well as I do,

47:42.509 --> 47:44.193
the spouse is
number one.

47:46.013 --> 47:47.864
Maybe he had
an accomplice.

47:48.015 --> 47:50.424
What did Claire Donahue
say yesterday, anyway?

47:50.443 --> 47:53.202
Not much. I mean, she was
a little bit nervous,

47:53.354 --> 47:56.263
but her boss was
just murdered, so...

47:56.282 --> 47:57.707
You gotta talk
to her again.

47:57.783 --> 47:59.375
I just wish we had that
damn security video

47:59.526 --> 48:00.768
from the murder scene.

48:00.786 --> 48:02.545
Awfully convenient that
the camera didn't work

48:02.622 --> 48:03.713
the night of
the murder.

48:03.864 --> 48:05.214
[phone dings]

48:06.700 --> 48:08.609
Oh, the tests are
back on the weapon.

48:08.628 --> 48:12.463
Three unknown sets of
prints, one match so far.

48:12.615 --> 48:13.872
Who?

48:13.892 --> 48:15.224
Claire Donahue.

48:16.969 --> 48:18.728
Why are her prints
in the system?

48:18.879 --> 48:20.121
Good question.

48:20.139 --> 48:23.900
Looks like she was
arrested for manslaughter.

48:23.976 --> 48:25.793
Her ex-boyfriend.

48:25.811 --> 48:27.570
She was never
formally charged.

48:27.721 --> 48:30.907
And it was ruled
an accident.

48:31.058 --> 48:32.742
Huh.

48:32.818 --> 48:42.476
¶

48:42.478 --> 48:42.919
Hello, Claire!

48:44.738 --> 48:47.314
(sharp inhalation) Stay
away from me!

48:47.316 --> 48:48.257
Just wanna talk.

48:48.409 --> 48:49.592
Now you wanna talk?

48:49.669 --> 48:50.834
Look, I thought
you should know,

48:50.987 --> 48:52.595
I told the police about
our one-night stand.

48:52.746 --> 48:54.655
What? Why would
you do that?

48:54.674 --> 48:56.265
'Cause I'm an honest
person, Claire.

48:56.417 --> 48:58.583
And I thought it was
important that they knew.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.102
I'm sure they're gonna
want to talk to you

49:00.254 --> 49:01.420
if they haven't already.

49:01.439 --> 49:03.606
I had nothing to do
with your wife's murder.

49:03.757 --> 49:05.166
Well, it's just a heads-up.

49:05.184 --> 49:06.609
You're welcome.

49:06.686 --> 49:08.611
(breathing)
You're sick.

49:10.431 --> 49:13.282
Well, I should probably
get back to my run.

49:13.434 --> 49:15.034
You have yourself a
good day, all right?

49:23.944 --> 49:27.129
(breathing) What
is happening?

49:27.206 --> 49:31.801
"Tiffany, please call me as
soon as you get this, OK?

49:31.952 --> 49:33.803
Something really bad
happened tonight."

49:33.879 --> 49:47.400
¶

49:50.730 --> 49:53.322
I found this under
Brian Coleman's car.

49:55.901 --> 49:58.077
I think we know how she's
been tracking him now.

50:00.573 --> 50:02.723
Anna: He told the police about
what happened with you?

50:02.742 --> 50:04.500
He said he was
being honest.

50:04.651 --> 50:07.003
I guess that
makes SOME sense.

50:07.154 --> 50:08.562
Yeah, but the way
he's acting doesn't.

50:08.581 --> 50:10.080
I mean, he's all
over me one minute,

50:10.233 --> 50:12.675
and a total
jerk the next.

50:12.826 --> 50:15.327
(sigh) I'm scared.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.905
Mom, that letter opener
came from my work.

50:17.923 --> 50:19.849
Well, did everyone
have access to it?

50:19.925 --> 50:22.518
It's from the copy
room, so yeah.

50:25.005 --> 50:27.339
Would Brian Coleman
have access?

50:27.358 --> 50:29.859
Well, his wife owned
the company so, I guess.

50:31.604 --> 50:35.364
You said he was acting
strange at the coffee shop.

50:35.516 --> 50:37.033
And, when you came
to the restaurant

50:37.109 --> 50:38.926
on the night of
the murder, right?

50:38.944 --> 50:40.036
Yeah, he told me to leave.

50:40.187 --> 50:41.537
Caused a major scene.

50:41.688 --> 50:43.205
But earlier that day,
you had a great time

50:43.282 --> 50:47.209
on the running trail
when no one was around?

50:47.286 --> 50:50.437
At first, I was thinking that
he was treating me badly

50:50.456 --> 50:52.548
in front of people so that his
wife wouldn't find out

50:52.699 --> 50:55.384
but now...

50:55.461 --> 50:56.944
Mom.

50:56.962 --> 50:58.554
I think that he's playing
some kind of game.

50:58.705 --> 51:00.222
He's up to something.

51:00.299 --> 51:01.557
What do you know
about this guy?

51:01.708 --> 51:03.225
Not much.

51:03.302 --> 51:05.394
He told me that he's
been married before.

51:05.546 --> 51:07.229
His wife killed herself.

51:07.381 --> 51:08.806
Oh, really?

51:08.958 --> 51:11.400
He said that his relationship
with Margaret was a rebound,

51:11.552 --> 51:13.736
that he didn't
really love her.

51:13.813 --> 51:15.571
Would he have
reason to kill her?

51:15.722 --> 51:17.239
She's worth a
lot of money.

51:20.136 --> 51:23.304
It terrifies me
to say this, but

51:23.322 --> 51:25.414
I think that he might
be trying to frame me!

51:26.733 --> 51:27.750
I'm not going to jail!

51:27.901 --> 51:28.751
He is!

51:33.649 --> 51:34.757
Anna: You're
back on your meds?

51:34.908 --> 51:36.092
Yes, Mom. Happy now?

51:40.747 --> 51:41.931
[clatter]

51:42.082 --> 51:44.491
OK. Just
calm down.

51:44.510 --> 51:45.768
Don't tell me
to calm down!

51:47.921 --> 51:49.105
Maybe I should
call Dad.

51:49.256 --> 51:50.773
Ask him what
to do.

51:54.520 --> 51:55.778
[doorbell rings]

51:57.523 --> 51:58.781
I'll get it.

52:05.272 --> 52:06.938
[door opens]

52:06.958 --> 52:08.349
Can I help you?

52:08.367 --> 52:10.459
I'm Detective Bailey
with Philly PD.

52:10.611 --> 52:12.019
Is your daughter
Claire home?

52:12.037 --> 52:13.796
Yes. What's this about?

52:13.873 --> 52:16.298
The murder of
Margaret Coleman.

52:16.450 --> 52:17.967
You need to come
downtown with me.

52:18.043 --> 52:20.803
¶

52:20.954 --> 52:22.529
Text Sophia. Her
number's in my phone.

52:22.548 --> 52:23.806
I'd like to see
your phone.

52:23.957 --> 52:25.141
Do you have
a warrant?

52:25.217 --> 52:26.033
No.

52:26.051 --> 52:26.884
Then, no.

52:27.036 --> 52:28.310
Not without my lawyer.

52:28.462 --> 52:29.979
Tell Sophia to meet
me at the station.

52:30.055 --> 52:31.147
Yes.

52:31.223 --> 52:37.153
¶

52:41.550 --> 52:43.325
They think that I
killed her, Mom!

52:43.477 --> 52:44.994
They found my prints
on the murder weapon.

52:45.145 --> 52:46.553
So why weren't
you arrested?

52:46.555 --> 52:47.830
I don't know.

52:47.981 --> 52:49.573
Did you tell them
about Brian?

52:49.725 --> 52:52.001
No, Sophia said not
to say anything.

52:52.152 --> 52:53.560
Is she still
at the station?

52:53.562 --> 52:55.838
The last I saw, she was
talking to the detectives.

52:55.989 --> 52:58.340
She wants us to come see
her tomorrow about the case.

52:58.417 --> 52:59.675
OK.

53:03.088 --> 53:04.096
I'm sorry.

53:05.666 --> 53:07.516
About what I
said about Dad.

53:07.668 --> 53:08.851
You didn't
deserve that.

53:10.855 --> 53:13.689
I am so grateful
for you.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.524
I know. It's OK, honey.

53:15.676 --> 53:16.692
I love you.

53:19.772 --> 53:21.530
Everything's
gonna be fine.

53:21.607 --> 53:25.201
¶

53:25.277 --> 53:27.778
So.... they found three
other sets of prints

53:27.930 --> 53:28.929
on the letter opener.

53:28.948 --> 53:30.206
That's why you
weren't arrested.

53:30.357 --> 53:31.598
Well, whose were they?

53:31.600 --> 53:32.783
They won't say.

53:32.935 --> 53:35.544
But you should know that
they have text messages

53:35.696 --> 53:38.547
that apparently show you were
obsessed with Brian Coleman.

53:38.699 --> 53:39.715
From Brian's phone.

53:39.866 --> 53:41.108
I never text him.

53:41.126 --> 53:42.776
Here, you can
look at my phone.

53:42.795 --> 53:45.554
The police said it
came from your number.

53:45.706 --> 53:47.781
Well, that is
impossible.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.058
He must have faked
them somehow.

53:49.209 --> 53:50.392
Well, he was here
a couple of times.

53:50.469 --> 53:51.727
Maybe he did something.

53:51.878 --> 53:53.562
It's possible.

53:53.714 --> 53:55.898
They also have a
video of an argument

53:56.049 --> 53:58.234
with the two of you
at a coffee shop.

53:58.385 --> 53:59.902
He claimed that I
followed him there.

54:00.053 --> 54:01.403
But I was already
going to that place.

54:01.555 --> 54:05.407
Look. My text to
Tiffany proves it.

54:05.559 --> 54:07.076
[notification chirp]

54:11.657 --> 54:13.082
What do we have?

54:13.233 --> 54:14.250
Claire: It's gone.

54:14.401 --> 54:15.918
Mom, you know I
was going to meet her.

54:16.069 --> 54:17.253
Anna: Yes, she was.

54:17.404 --> 54:19.980
OK. There's something
else that I learned,

54:19.999 --> 54:21.257
and it doesn't
look good, Claire.

54:23.243 --> 54:25.761
The police checked Brian's
car and they found a tracker.

54:25.838 --> 54:27.263
So?

54:27.414 --> 54:29.098
So, it traces back
to your credit card.

54:29.249 --> 54:32.326
What? He must've
stolen my number.

54:32.344 --> 54:33.269
You have to
tell the police

54:33.345 --> 54:34.937
about what Brian's
been doing...

54:35.088 --> 54:36.772
I don't want to say
anything until we know more.

54:36.923 --> 54:38.607
Claire can look like
the unstable one.

54:38.759 --> 54:41.277
Especially given...
her past.

54:41.428 --> 54:43.112
And you should know,
since I advised you

54:43.263 --> 54:44.780
not to turn over
your phone...

54:44.931 --> 54:46.782
I'm sure they're working
on a warrant as we speak.

54:46.933 --> 54:48.951
So now I look even more guilty
because I'm not cooperating.

54:49.102 --> 54:50.677
And, I mean, my
alibi is terrible.

54:50.696 --> 54:52.288
I was driving around
to clear my head.

54:52.439 --> 54:53.956
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, calm down.

54:54.033 --> 54:55.682
The last thing you want
is to say something

54:55.701 --> 54:56.959
you're gonna
regret later.

54:57.110 --> 54:58.460
OK?

54:58.612 --> 55:00.129
Anything can be used
against you in trial.

55:00.280 --> 55:01.797
What? Trial?

55:01.948 --> 55:03.206
We're not there yet.

55:03.359 --> 55:04.691
Not even close.

55:04.710 --> 55:06.302
Anna: We need to find out
everything we can

55:06.378 --> 55:08.195
about this Brian Coleman.

55:08.213 --> 55:09.805
¶¶

55:09.882 --> 55:11.365
Kim: I put my money
on the girl.

55:11.383 --> 55:13.124
Yeah, but we've got three
other print matches

55:13.144 --> 55:14.476
on the weapon.

55:14.628 --> 55:15.978
All Coleman's employees.

55:16.129 --> 55:17.980
All with no motive.

55:18.131 --> 55:21.375
Claire Donahue slept with the
husband and let's not forget,

55:21.393 --> 55:24.044
she killed her ex-boyfriend
and spent six months

55:24.063 --> 55:25.712
in court-ordered therapy.

55:25.714 --> 55:29.216
What happened in New
York was an accident.

55:29.234 --> 55:31.160
The file says
she has PTSD.

55:31.311 --> 55:33.495
She sounds crazy to me.

55:33.647 --> 55:36.390
Let's talk about
Brian Coleman.

55:36.408 --> 55:40.502
He has two wealthy dead wives
in his rear-view mirror.

55:40.654 --> 55:42.896
Not to mention he's about to
collect five million dollars

55:42.915 --> 55:44.506
on the estate.
- True.

55:44.583 --> 55:46.400
But the lawyer you
spoke to confirmed

55:46.418 --> 55:48.068
that he wasn't planning
on asking for any money

55:48.070 --> 55:49.345
in the divorce.

55:49.496 --> 55:51.013
That could've been part
of his premeditated plan.

55:51.090 --> 55:54.241
You saw the texts
and the tracker.

55:54.259 --> 55:57.353
Claire Donahue wanted
Brian Coleman for herself.

55:57.429 --> 55:58.854
Do we really think
that anyone could get

55:59.005 --> 56:00.689
that obsessed
so quickly?

56:00.766 --> 56:02.024
They'd only
just met.

56:02.175 --> 56:03.750
I've seen it
happen before.

waiting for?

56:11.443 --> 56:15.204

56:15.355 --> 56:18.207
I remember Brian saying
that he had a stepdaughter.

56:18.283 --> 56:20.767
Well, did he tell
you her name?

56:20.769 --> 56:24.713
No. But there was an obit
for his wife I saw online.

56:24.865 --> 56:26.048
Anna: Can you find it?

56:28.219 --> 56:31.053
Lisa Coleman, 38, Trenton.

56:31.204 --> 56:33.463
Survived by her daughter,
Madison Kennedy,

56:33.616 --> 56:37.284
and her parents,
Jack and Tina Sallow.

56:37.302 --> 56:39.561
I wonder if Madison
still lives in Trenton?

56:49.314 --> 56:50.906
That's strange.

56:50.983 --> 56:52.741
Her mother's maiden
name is Sallow.

56:55.896 --> 56:58.414
Look at this.

56:58.565 --> 57:01.808
Well, that must've been
before Brian came along.

57:01.827 --> 57:03.419
Is there an
address listed?

57:03.570 --> 57:07.238
No. But I can reverse
image search it.

57:07.258 --> 57:10.259
See if it's listed on
any real estate sites.

57:13.914 --> 57:16.682
Got it. 12 Poppy Lane.

57:20.679 --> 57:21.678
You should have never gone

nosing around in my
business, Claire.

57:24.925 --> 57:26.275
That's a bad idea.

57:34.693 --> 57:38.120
I'm going to keep
my promise, Dad.

57:38.271 --> 57:39.538
Don't worry.

57:41.033 --> 57:43.125
I guess I'm going to Trenton,
to try to find Madison.

57:43.276 --> 57:44.460
I'm coming with you.

57:44.611 --> 57:45.794
No!

57:48.615 --> 57:50.132
Sorry, Mom.

I'm just, I'm a
little on edge.

Sophia said that the police
are probably trying to get

57:53.787 --> 57:55.195
a search warrant for
my house too so...

57:55.214 --> 57:56.972
I need you to stay up-to-date
on what they're doing.

57:57.123 --> 57:59.199
I don't think
you should go.

57:59.218 --> 58:01.201
We need to tell
the police.

I can't trust

58:32.993 --> 58:35.177
My name is
Claire Donahue.

58:35.328 --> 58:38.347
I was hoping to ask you a few
questions about Brian Coleman.

58:38.423 --> 58:41.074
Um, I can't help
you. I'm sorry.

58:41.076 --> 58:42.017
Madison, please.

58:42.094 --> 58:44.686

58:44.838 --> 58:46.522
I think he's trying to
frame me for murder.

58:47.841 --> 58:48.941
Murder?

58:51.344 --> 58:52.528
OK, Come in.

59:04.116 --> 59:06.041
Brian's new wife
was just murdered.

59:07.360 --> 59:09.711
And I think
that he did it.

59:09.863 --> 59:12.047
I can't believe this
is happening again!

59:12.124 --> 59:12.939
Again?

59:12.958 --> 59:14.608
He's dangerous.

59:14.626 --> 59:16.885
Very dangerous.

59:16.962 --> 59:18.220
You don't want
to mess with him.

59:18.371 --> 59:19.638
He is messing with me.

59:21.633 --> 59:24.226
Did he do something
to your mom?

59:24.377 --> 59:31.066
He, uh, either killed her or
drove her to kill herself.

59:31.217 --> 59:32.401
Pick your poison.

59:32.552 --> 59:34.903
Why would he
want her dead?

59:35.055 --> 59:36.905
Money.

59:36.982 --> 59:38.240
He convinced my
mom to leave him

59:38.317 --> 59:39.741
half of everything
in her will.

59:39.818 --> 59:40.909
And did he get it?

59:40.986 --> 59:42.411
Mm.

59:42.487 --> 59:45.247
She secretly changed it a
few days before she died.

59:45.398 --> 59:47.307
Why?

59:47.326 --> 59:49.142
She feared him
near the end.

59:49.161 --> 59:51.086
She was going to
file for divorce

59:51.237 --> 59:55.315
but never got
the chance.

59:55.317 --> 59:57.484
Madison, did you tell
the police all this?

59:57.502 --> 59:59.428
They wouldn't
listen to me.

59:59.579 --> 1:00:00.762
Since she had a
history of depression,

1:00:00.914 --> 1:00:02.989
they ruled it a suicide.

1:00:02.991 --> 1:00:05.601
They said there was no
evidence to prove otherwise.

1:00:08.421 --> 1:00:11.273
I want to show
you her journal.

1:00:11.350 --> 1:00:14.943
Brian was mentally
torturing her.

Just my mom.

1:00:52.966 --> 1:00:54.149
Someone's in
the house.

1:00:58.714 --> 1:01:00.638
Hi. We need the
police right away.

1:01:00.658 --> 1:01:03.717
There's an intruder inside
the house at 12 Poppy Lane.

1:01:03.735 --> 1:01:04.885

me move this.

1:01:48.263 --> 1:01:49.705
Go. I'll be OK.

I can't right now.

1:03:05.690 --> 1:03:08.116
Sophia said there's now a
warrant out for your arrest

1:03:08.193 --> 1:03:09.951

1:03:10.103 --> 1:03:12.120

Brian's house key

him and his wife.

Well, where are you going?

I need your help.

1:03:57.650 --> 1:03:58.667
The police are after me.

1:03:58.743 --> 1:04:00.226
What?

1:04:00.245 --> 1:04:01.837
Is the house still
in Grandpa's name?

1:04:01.988 --> 1:04:03.063
Yes.

1:04:03.081 --> 1:04:04.256
Then they probably
won't find me here.

1:04:06.826 --> 1:04:08.343
[door squeaks closed]

1:04:09.996 --> 1:04:12.514
Why didn't you come to
me sooner on all this?

1:04:12.665 --> 1:04:16.910
Dad, our relationship hasn't
exactly been a greeting card.

1:04:16.928 --> 1:04:19.746
I know. And I'm
sorry for that.

1:04:19.764 --> 1:04:21.748
Well, maybe you should've
thought about that

1:04:21.750 --> 1:04:24.584
before you made the
choices that you did.

1:04:24.586 --> 1:04:27.420
I deserved that.

1:04:27.422 --> 1:04:29.422
How's your mom?

1:04:29.424 --> 1:04:30.532
She's all right.

1:04:34.020 --> 1:04:40.934
Biggest regret of my life,
hurting her, and you.

1:04:40.936 --> 1:04:42.210
But now.

1:04:42.287 --> 1:04:44.880
We gotta get you
out of this mess.

1:04:44.956 --> 1:04:48.717
Since you know so
much about computers,

1:04:48.868 --> 1:04:51.887
I was hoping that maybe you
could take a look at mine.

1:04:51.963 --> 1:04:56.558

1:04:56.709 --> 1:04:58.468

thought this Brian guy

1:04:58.620 --> 1:05:00.120
always seems to
know where you are.

1:05:00.138 --> 1:05:05.233
Might have been faking texts,
posting on social media?

1:05:05.385 --> 1:05:08.628
Did he ever have access
to your phone or computer?

1:05:08.647 --> 1:05:11.239
Well, he was at my
house so, I guess.

1:05:11.316 --> 1:05:16.745

1:05:16.896 --> 1:05:17.971
Claire: What are you doing?

1:05:17.989 --> 1:05:19.748
I'm checking your
virtual ports.

1:05:19.899 --> 1:05:21.833
He may have
installed spyware.

1:05:23.662 --> 1:05:24.753
Just as I thought.

1:05:24.904 --> 1:05:25.921
A key logger.

1:05:26.072 --> 1:05:27.422
What's a key logger?

1:05:27.499 --> 1:05:29.090
Dad: It records every
keystroke you make

1:05:29.167 --> 1:05:31.501
on your keyboard.

1:05:31.653 --> 1:05:34.487
He's probably got
all your passwords.

1:05:34.506 --> 1:05:36.823
And he can log in
remotely, which means

1:05:36.841 --> 1:05:40.602
he can watch you
through your camera.

1:05:40.753 --> 1:05:43.438
Oh my God!

1:05:43.589 --> 1:05:46.107
What about my phone?

1:05:46.259 --> 1:05:47.442
- It's hot.

1:05:47.593 --> 1:05:48.610
- What does that mean?

1:05:48.687 --> 1:05:50.946
- Classic sign of a
key logger.

1:05:51.097 --> 1:05:52.614
Has your battery been
draining quickly?

1:05:52.765 --> 1:05:54.115
Is it slow?

1:05:54.192 --> 1:05:55.951
Yeah. Come to think of it.

1:05:56.102 --> 1:05:59.454
The file will end in APK
if it's been infected.

1:05:59.605 --> 1:06:03.016
(sigh)

1:06:03.034 --> 1:06:05.293
Here it is. He's got
your phone too.

1:06:05.445 --> 1:06:06.853
You know, there are
all kinds of ways

1:06:06.871 --> 1:06:08.021
to spoof calls
and texts.

1:06:08.039 --> 1:06:09.205
Son of a bitch!

1:06:09.282 --> 1:06:11.449
I have a lot stronger
things I'd like to say.

1:06:12.877 --> 1:06:17.639
Well, I guess it pays to have
a software engineer for a dad.

1:06:17.790 --> 1:06:19.140
So, I need to destroy this.

1:06:19.217 --> 1:06:20.642
He probably knows
where I am.

1:06:20.793 --> 1:06:23.052
I told Mom that I
was coming here.

1:06:23.205 --> 1:06:24.646
I doubt he'll find
this place.

1:06:24.797 --> 1:06:27.148
Plus, I'm installing
anti-virus software

1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:29.651
so there's no need
to destroy anything.

the whereabouts

of a fugitive from
Philadelphia.

1:06:46.652 --> 1:06:47.669
We need to go
to the police.

1:06:47.820 --> 1:06:48.670
No, I'm not sure
it's enough

1:06:48.821 --> 1:06:50.005
with everything that
they have on me.

1:06:50.156 --> 1:06:51.673
And will this even
trace back to Brian?

1:06:51.824 --> 1:06:53.508
Probably not, if he's
covered his tracks.

1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:57.403
I should go.

1:06:57.422 --> 1:06:58.680
I don't want to
get you in trouble.

1:06:58.831 --> 1:07:00.181
I'm your dad!

I'd take a
bullet for you.

1:07:02.335 --> 1:07:03.601
You don't need
to go anywhere.

1:07:05.338 --> 1:07:07.522
I've changed, Claire.

1:07:07.673 --> 1:07:10.250
I realize now what's
important in life.

1:07:20.595 --> 1:07:22.871

I want to be
a better man.

what I did.

Well, an apology
is a good start.

1:07:34.718 --> 1:07:36.885
I'm gonna go
to sleep.

1:07:37.036 --> 1:07:39.888
OK. Tomorrow, we'll
come up with a plan.

1:10:44.148 --> 1:10:46.407
Yeah, but how are you
going to prove it?

1:10:46.484 --> 1:10:50.745
I went to Brian's
stepdaughter's place.

1:10:50.896 --> 1:10:52.396
He broke in while
I was at the house.

1:10:52.415 --> 1:10:53.581
What?

1:10:53.733 --> 1:10:55.083
I think he killed
his other wife.

1:10:55.159 --> 1:10:57.143
But then wouldn't
he be in prison?

1:10:57.145 --> 1:10:59.254
Madison said that no
one would believe her.

1:10:59.405 --> 1:11:02.090
But, with this
new murder, I mean,

1:11:02.241 --> 1:11:04.150
maybe they'll
reopen the case.

1:11:04.168 --> 1:11:06.319
That reminds me.
I need to search

1:11:06.337 --> 1:11:08.346
the number for Trenton
Park Hospital.

1:11:14.012 --> 1:11:15.995
Hi. I'm calling to
check on a patient.

1:11:15.997 --> 1:11:17.663
Madison Kennedy.

1:11:17.682 --> 1:11:20.608
She, uh, was brought
in the other day.

1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:21.943
Is she OK?

1:11:26.265 --> 1:11:28.283
Thanks. I understand.

1:11:30.102 --> 1:11:31.786
What did they say?

1:11:31.937 --> 1:11:33.955
They can't give out that kind
of information on the phone.

1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:36.958
OK, Claire.

1:11:37.035 --> 1:11:38.793
I'm saying this for your
own good, all right?

1:11:38.944 --> 1:11:40.520
I think you should
turn yourself in.

1:11:40.522 --> 1:11:42.130
Tell the police that
Brian's been stalking you.

1:11:42.206 --> 1:11:43.798
No.

1:11:43.949 --> 1:11:45.466
He will find a way to
make them not believe me.

1:11:47.953 --> 1:11:49.862
I have a better idea.

1:11:49.881 --> 1:11:52.140
There was a ranger
at Briarwood Park

1:11:52.216 --> 1:11:54.124
the day that I
was with Brian.

1:11:54.144 --> 1:11:57.145
Maybe he could vouch for
how nice he was to me

1:11:57.296 --> 1:12:00.148
and prove that Brian's
been lying to the police.

1:12:00.299 --> 1:12:02.150
OK, so, tell the police
about the ranger.

1:12:02.226 --> 1:12:02.875
They can help you.

1:12:02.894 --> 1:12:03.985
Not yet.

1:12:07.473 --> 1:12:09.215
OK. This is spiraling
out of control.

1:12:09.233 --> 1:12:10.716
I mean, now your
dad's in trouble...

1:12:10.735 --> 1:12:12.160
How'd you know
about my dad?

1:12:13.237 --> 1:12:15.163
It was on the news.

1:12:15.239 --> 1:12:16.889
Oh.

1:12:16.891 --> 1:12:21.002
Claire. I'm just trying to
help. You know that, right?

1:12:21.079 --> 1:12:22.670
Could you take me
to the park?

1:12:22.822 --> 1:12:25.414
Yeah, if you think
that'll help, sure.

1:12:25.567 --> 1:12:27.175
And why don't you borrow
some of my clothes?

1:12:27.326 --> 1:12:28.343
You had a long night.

1:12:28.494 --> 1:12:29.902
Take anything you want, OK?

1:12:29.921 --> 1:12:33.406
I have a extra toothbrush
in my spare bathroom.

1:12:33.408 --> 1:12:34.907
Thanks, Tiffany.

1:12:34.926 --> 1:12:35.516
Yeah.

[cracking sound]

1:13:16.634 --> 1:13:17.725
Did you hear that?

1:13:22.882 --> 1:13:23.981
Oh, oh, oh.

1:13:26.051 --> 1:13:28.403
Am I ever glad
to see you.

1:13:28.554 --> 1:13:29.645
I don't hear
that every day.

1:13:29.797 --> 1:13:30.963
Can I ask you a question?

1:13:30.965 --> 1:13:32.240
Dale.

1:13:32.316 --> 1:13:33.482
That's what
I'm here for.

1:13:33.635 --> 1:13:35.243
Do you recognize me
from here at the trail?

1:13:35.394 --> 1:13:37.745
Yeah. I saw you the other day
with your boyfriend, right?

1:13:37.822 --> 1:13:39.080
Running?
- Yes.

1:13:39.231 --> 1:13:42.583
Uh, and why did you think
that he was my boyfriend?

1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:44.477
Well, you guys
looked like a couple.

1:13:44.495 --> 1:13:45.420
You were playful.

1:13:45.571 --> 1:13:46.921
Even, laughing I think?

1:13:47.072 --> 1:13:49.757
Would you be willing to
tell the police that?

1:13:49.909 --> 1:13:52.260
Can I ask what
this is about?

1:13:52.411 --> 1:13:54.429
The man that I was
with, Brian Coleman,

1:13:54.580 --> 1:13:56.322
he told the police that
I'm obsessed with him.

1:13:56.340 --> 1:13:57.432
And it has to do
with a murder.

1:13:57.583 --> 1:13:58.599
There's an
investigation.

1:13:58.751 --> 1:14:00.268
So, what do you have
me wrapped up in?

1:14:00.344 --> 1:14:02.662
It's complicated.

1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:04.830
but he's trying
to frame me.

1:14:04.849 --> 1:14:06.107
Please.

1:14:08.093 --> 1:14:09.277
Well, what I saw
is the truth.

1:14:09.353 --> 1:14:11.112
So sure, I guess I could
talk to the police.

1:14:11.189 --> 1:14:12.613
Would you be willing
to come with us now?

1:14:12.690 --> 1:14:13.839
We could take you
to the station.

1:14:13.858 --> 1:14:17.935
My shift's not over. But
I can go after work.

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:19.954

1:14:23.367 --> 1:14:24.292

1:14:53.397 --> 1:14:54.489
Sorry, Dale.

1:14:56.734 --> 1:14:58.493
But I can't have you
talking to the police.

1:15:05.409 --> 1:15:07.226
Claire: I need to speak
with Detective Bailey.

1:15:07.228 --> 1:15:09.228
[ring signal]

1:15:09.247 --> 1:15:10.229
Bailey.

1:15:10.248 --> 1:15:11.731
Detective. It's
Claire Donahue.

1:15:11.733 --> 1:15:13.232
- Where are you?

1:15:13.234 --> 1:15:16.511
Claire. You need to
turn yourself in. Now.

1:15:18.664 --> 1:15:20.848
Do it now before you
get deeper into trouble.

1:15:20.925 --> 1:15:22.350
- I didn't kill
Margaret Coleman.

1:15:22.501 --> 1:15:23.351
Brian's framing me.

1:15:23.502 --> 1:15:24.910
And we can talk about this.

1:15:24.929 --> 1:15:26.579
Let me know where you are.
I'll come pick you up.

1:15:26.581 --> 1:15:29.357
He put spyware on my
phone and my computer.

1:15:29.508 --> 1:15:31.083
He planted that
photo in my house.

1:15:31.102 --> 1:15:32.251
- I can help you.

1:15:32.270 --> 1:15:34.086
In person.

1:15:34.105 --> 1:15:35.363
- How'd you find
me last night?

1:15:35.514 --> 1:15:36.447
Was it from a tip?

1:15:37.608 --> 1:15:40.183
A man called the
police, didn't he?

1:15:40.203 --> 1:15:42.203
It was Brian!

1:15:42.354 --> 1:15:44.705
Before I got to my dad's,
he tried to attack me

1:15:44.857 --> 1:15:45.931
and his stepdaughter,

1:15:45.950 --> 1:15:47.767
a woman named
Madison Kennedy.

1:15:47.785 --> 1:15:49.602
She's in a hospital
in Trenton.

1:15:49.620 --> 1:15:51.212
You need to
speak with her.

1:15:51.289 --> 1:15:53.881
And, also to a ranger
at Briarwood Park.

1:15:53.958 --> 1:15:55.216
His name's Dale McNichol.

1:15:55.367 --> 1:15:57.218
He saw Brian and me together.

1:15:57.369 --> 1:15:58.386
I just talked to him.

1:15:58.537 --> 1:15:59.887
We'll look into this.

1:16:00.039 --> 1:16:01.556
Now, tell me where you are.

1:16:04.969 --> 1:16:07.395
(sigh) She seemed genuine.

1:16:07.546 --> 1:16:09.397
Genuinely UNHINGED.

1:16:12.885 --> 1:16:13.901
Can you drop me off?

1:16:13.978 --> 1:16:22.410
¶

1:16:22.486 --> 1:16:24.078
I'll be back at
your house later.

1:16:24.229 --> 1:16:26.247
Yeah. It's the safest
place for you.

1:16:38.243 --> 1:16:39.760
She's staying at
my place tonight...

1:16:42.173 --> 1:16:43.989
Anna: Claire, I just
heard on the news.

1:16:44.008 --> 1:16:45.600
That ranger was murdered.

1:16:45.751 --> 1:16:48.436
What? Are you sure?

1:16:48.512 --> 1:16:51.439
Mom, I was just at
Briarwood Park with...

1:16:53.351 --> 1:16:54.442
Tiffany.

1:16:55.928 --> 1:16:57.445
I gotta call Sophia now. Bye.

1:17:07.698 --> 1:17:08.364
Hello?

1:17:08.516 --> 1:17:10.015
- Sophia.
- Claire?

1:17:10.017 --> 1:17:12.460
I need to see you right away.
- OK. Where?

1:17:12.536 --> 1:17:15.112
-Meet me at that place we used
to meet when we'd skip school.

1:17:15.131 --> 1:17:16.297
When?

1:17:16.448 --> 1:17:17.356
30 minutes.

1:17:17.375 --> 1:17:19.133
Got it.

1:17:19.284 --> 1:17:22.027
Can you see if you can find
any background on Tiffany?

1:17:22.029 --> 1:17:22.970
Sure.

1:17:23.122 --> 1:17:24.138
I'll explain when I see you.

1:17:24.215 --> 1:17:25.364
OK.

1:17:25.383 --> 1:17:26.307
Thanks.

1:17:31.222 --> 1:17:33.981
The dead park ranger is the
same one that Claire Donahue

1:17:34.133 --> 1:17:35.983
said she talked
to this morning.

1:17:36.060 --> 1:17:38.152
That's a big
coincidence.

1:17:38.229 --> 1:17:41.155
I don't think this is
a coincidence at all.

1:17:41.306 --> 1:17:42.548
Claire: It had to be Tiffany.

1:17:42.566 --> 1:17:43.658
How else would
Brian have known

1:17:43.809 --> 1:17:45.326
that I was going
to be at the park?

1:17:45.477 --> 1:17:46.661
And now the
ranger's dead?

1:17:46.737 --> 1:17:48.996
So I found out she's
originally from Atlanta.

1:17:49.073 --> 1:17:50.556
She told us she
was from Philly.

1:17:50.574 --> 1:17:51.165
She lied.

1:17:52.743 --> 1:17:54.894
You know Brian said
that he's from Atlanta.

1:17:54.912 --> 1:17:57.672
I would bet anything that
they know each other.

1:17:57.823 --> 1:17:59.507
They do. Her resumé
on Linked Up said

1:17:59.658 --> 1:18:02.677
she worked at Bistro
470 in Atlanta.

1:18:02.828 --> 1:18:04.679
That was Brian's
restaurant.

1:18:04.830 --> 1:18:06.405
They are in on
this together!

1:18:06.407 --> 1:18:07.573
They have to be.

1:18:07.575 --> 1:18:08.516
Think about it.

1:18:08.667 --> 1:18:09.850
Tiffany would've
known that I had used

1:18:10.002 --> 1:18:11.243
that letter
opener at work.

1:18:11.262 --> 1:18:13.187
And she's the one that
invited me to Galentine's

1:18:13.338 --> 1:18:15.356
at Brian's restaurant.

1:18:15.507 --> 1:18:18.025
I have totally
been played.

1:18:18.102 --> 1:18:21.028
OK, so here's
what we're gonna do.

1:18:39.031 --> 1:18:40.214
Thanks for helping me.

1:18:40.365 --> 1:18:41.882

You did what
you had to do.

Hey, I would've thought
I was guilty too.

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:17.549
Well, that would be OK.

1:23:17.568 --> 1:23:18.808
Mm mm hm.

1:23:18.828 --> 1:23:20.327
The deal she made to turn
on Brian will help her,

1:23:20.479 --> 1:23:22.663
but it doesn't
exonerate her.

1:23:22.814 --> 1:23:26.166
Did she say why she chose
me to carry out the plan?

1:23:26.318 --> 1:23:29.077
She told the police that after
learning about your history,

1:23:29.230 --> 1:23:31.005
she figured you'd
make a perfect patsy.

1:23:31.081 --> 1:23:31.672
Wow.

1:23:31.749 --> 1:23:32.564
Yeah.

1:23:32.583 --> 1:23:33.841
Get this.

1:23:33.917 --> 1:23:35.567
She also worked in Trenton.

1:23:35.569 --> 1:23:38.178
Odds are good that she was
in on Brian's other plan.

1:23:39.923 --> 1:23:41.181
[doorbell rings]

1:23:41.333 --> 1:23:42.349
I wonder who that is.

1:23:42.426 --> 1:23:45.410
Uh, I'll get it.
- OK.

1:23:45.429 --> 1:23:47.354
Claire: Hope she likes
the surprise.

1:23:54.438 --> 1:23:56.012
Mick!

1:23:56.032 --> 1:23:57.698
Anna.

1:23:57.849 --> 1:23:59.700
I thought you ladies
might be hungry.

1:23:59.851 --> 1:24:02.870
Yeah. Come on in.

1:24:03.021 --> 1:24:06.598

1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:07.708
Pizza's here!

1:24:07.859 --> 1:24:09.043
Well, I am starving.

1:24:09.194 --> 1:24:10.377
Hey, well, let's eat.

1:24:10.454 --> 1:24:11.378
OK.

1:24:11.530 --> 1:24:12.713
Oh, do you wanna get
the placemats?
