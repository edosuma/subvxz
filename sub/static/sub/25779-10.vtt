WEBVTT

00:19.180 --> 00:20.466
Afternoon, gentlemen.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.808
Jeez, Alice. Doesn't your old man
ever give you a break?

00:26.770 --> 00:29.398
-Have you heard from Dud?
-Yep. Scheduled the surgery.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.487
-Best guy in Managua.
-Do you think he's--

00:31.610 --> 00:34.318
Oh, yeah. I talked to him today.
He's in great spirits.

00:35.570 --> 00:38.028
-And there he is.
-Thought you left already.

00:38.660 --> 00:41.698
Still making arrangements.
Hit a couple of snags. No biggie.

00:41.830 --> 00:44.572
-It's good that you're going down.
-Oh, for sure. Right.

00:47.290 --> 00:49.292
Have you got a sec?
Something I want to ask.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.831
So, I got a favor to ask, OK?

00:54.970 --> 00:56.210
Sure. Anything.

00:56.340 --> 00:57.330
Great.

00:58.930 --> 01:00.250
I was wondering if...

01:10.110 --> 01:11.521
while I'm gone,

01:11.650 --> 01:14.199
if you could keep an eye
on the shop for me.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.106
Because, you know,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.618
I'm expecting
a couple of deliveries and...

01:18.740 --> 01:21.198
-Oh, sure. No problem.
-All right. Great.

01:21.330 --> 01:23.537
Thanks, neighbor. Much obliged.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.450
Bye.

01:32.170 --> 01:33.547
I'll give you four grand.

01:48.060 --> 01:50.392
Bet you're wondering
where I got that primo watch.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.527
It's actually kind of a funny story.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.856
Well... never mind, then.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.277
I... I won't waste
any of your precious time.

02:03.830 --> 02:06.367
So... Burt showing you the ropes?

02:07.120 --> 02:10.124
Teaching you
how to be a greedy sack of shit?

02:20.340 --> 02:22.559
-Thank you for your business.
-Thank you.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.261
This thing's fake.

02:31.900 --> 02:32.970
It's worthless.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.640
I know that.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.521
But he doesn't.

02:37.650 --> 02:39.311
Then why did you give him four grand?

02:40.530 --> 02:42.066
You heard what happened to Dud.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.077
Bill needs the money to go get him.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.990
Damn, Burt.

02:50.210 --> 02:53.874
Eventually, one of the Dudleys will
buy it back for twice what I paid.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.502
They're sentimental.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.337
Believe me, it's an investment.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.857
So, I think I'm gonna go get
in the water.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.067
OK. T'll lock up.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.145
You want to come?

03:20.570 --> 03:21.605
No, I'm good.

03:26.490 --> 03:27.480
OK.

03:28.620 --> 03:30.031
-See you tomorrow.
-OK.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.670
Get out!

07:06.130 --> 07:07.256
Details remain murky

07:07.380 --> 07:10.793
in the growing scandal surrounding
the redevelopment of Orbis.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.887
City Council
has come under fire for...

07:13.010 --> 07:14.091
Are you following this?

07:14.220 --> 07:16.552
...green-lighting a proposal
by a consortium...

07:16.680 --> 07:17.670
Not really.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.387
-Five on pump two.
-I talked to some dude...

07:21.440 --> 07:24.432
who said he heard
the ground at Orbis is so toxic,

07:24.570 --> 07:26.140
it's causing hallucinations.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.520
Oh, yeah?

07:27.650 --> 07:30.142
Yeah, man. It's like
the whole city's been tripping.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.915
What the...?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.592
You took my car, you asshole!

07:55.220 --> 07:56.460
You read the terms.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.597
What are you gonna do with it, Burt?

08:00.140 --> 08:01.630
Herman wants to buy it.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.471
-It's a classic.
-OK, but hold on.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.227
See, I didn't have the money.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.522
My finances were all tied up,
but now I have it.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.106
I've got everything. All of it.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.481
All the interest and everything,
right here.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.988
-Fine. T'll get the papers.
-OK, good.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.299
You know what?

08:40.720 --> 08:41.926
Forget about it, Burt.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.394
You're just gonna take everything
anyway... eventually,

08:46.520 --> 08:48.602
so there's no use fighting with you.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.890
Might as well get used to it, huh?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.446
You really want the Thing, Herm?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.030
OK.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.288
I'll give you 50 bucks for my bike.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.120
A hundred.

09:10.880 --> 09:11.870
OK.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.250
Thank you for your business.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.768
I changed the starter out
a couple of years ago,

09:25.890 --> 09:28.439
so don't let a mechanic
talk you into a new one.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.147
Oh, and if it gets vapor lock...

09:32.860 --> 09:36.410
just clamp a few clothespins
to the fuel line.

09:36.530 --> 09:39.067
That should fix it,
at least for a little while.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.656
My cousin knows about cars.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.361
I'll bring it to him.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.661
Take good care of it, OK?

10:03.180 --> 10:05.512
It's damage control, Ernie.
I have no choice.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.438
I spent years
building those accounts.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.517
You can't just hand them
to Beautiful Jeff!

10:09.650 --> 10:10.640
He's ready.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.352
He doesn't have the experience!

10:12.480 --> 10:14.391
He's a bitch-ass little bitch!

10:14.530 --> 10:16.692
Experience doesn't matter anymore.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.902
Beautiful Jeff has that "it."

10:19.570 --> 10:22.232
You can't take your eyes off him!
The way he moves...

10:22.370 --> 10:24.031
We're just lucky to have you.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.150
Duh.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.327
Hey, Ernie,
you know what my secret is?

10:27.750 --> 10:29.616
-I don't try.
-He blew it in the desert.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.741
I'm the one who brought in Captain.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.450
Yeah, and how did that turn out?

10:33.590 --> 10:36.298
-That wasn't my fault.
-Here's the problem, Ernie.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.377
You got everybody's hopes up.

10:38.510 --> 10:41.047
I started making calls,
word got around,

10:41.180 --> 10:45.014
and half your wholesalers started
placing orders, trying to get ahead.

10:45.140 --> 10:49.259
That stock is just gonna sit
on their shelves because of you!

10:51.610 --> 10:52.805
Hey, you got conned.

10:52.940 --> 10:54.146
The whole city did.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.642
Even Captain, from what I'm hearing,
and he's in a coma.

10:58.740 --> 11:01.698
Poor guy - he got carjacked,
then shot in the head.

11:01.820 --> 11:03.026
-Unbelievable!
-What?

11:03.160 --> 11:04.867
I heard he fell off a beam
at a jobsite.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.537
Rebar went through his heart.

11:06.660 --> 11:09.459
Hey, it's Captain.
All kinds of rumors are swirling.

11:09.580 --> 11:10.957
We'll probably never know the truth.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.129
But the point is,
we all need a fresh start.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.376
Fresh start?

11:15.880 --> 11:18.212
You're sticking me
with every dog-shit wholesaler

11:18.340 --> 11:19.717
from here to Oxnard.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.174
You're my butter-and-egg man.
I know you'll come through.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.760
Hey, I tried telling you, Ernie.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.018
These big razzle-dazzle projects
never pan out.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.571
Hey.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.575
Remember me?

11:51.370 --> 11:55.034
Look, I know I've been a little
out of touch the past few days--

11:55.170 --> 11:56.285
Out of touch?

11:57.460 --> 11:58.950
You jumped off a boat.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.081
Do you understand the amount of panic
that you caused?

12:02.220 --> 12:03.210
I know.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.047
That's why I called
to let you guys know I was OK

12:06.180 --> 12:07.716
as soon as I got to the shore.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.091
I lost my phone in the water.
I had to ask a guy--

12:10.230 --> 12:12.187
Harbor Patrol was looking for you.

12:12.310 --> 12:13.892
Janet was in tears.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.858
-Janet was crying?
-Well, almost.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.779
-And you don't answer your phone?
-I told you, my phone was--

12:19.900 --> 12:22.733
I know you were at home
when I came by,

12:22.860 --> 12:25.568
but you just let me stand out there,
knocking like a maniac.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.407
I just didn't feel like talking.

12:29.370 --> 12:30.531
Oh, my God.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.958
So, what, are you here to apologize?

12:37.710 --> 12:40.293
No, I just want to say
I am ready to work.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.508
Do you actually think
after what you...

12:45.800 --> 12:47.632
You're acting like nothing happened.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.216
Well, look, I figure, you know,

12:49.350 --> 12:51.557
Janet's not a conventional thinker,

12:51.680 --> 12:53.887
and she'd look at the whole thing
and be like...

12:54.480 --> 12:55.470
"Blammo!

12:55.600 --> 12:57.352
Let's give her another chance."

13:04.700 --> 13:05.690
Well, I...

13:06.160 --> 13:08.697
I also wanted to see you, obviously.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.247
Want to get dinner or something?

13:14.080 --> 13:15.957
I tried, Liz.

13:16.960 --> 13:17.995
I tried saving you,

13:18.130 --> 13:19.620
but it's pointless.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.208
All right? You find something good,
and you blow it up.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.081
-You just can't help it.
-Yeah?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.837
And you can't help being some sad,

13:26.970 --> 13:28.847
pathetic, little corporate lapdog!

13:28.970 --> 13:30.176
-How dare you--
-Get out.

13:32.180 --> 13:33.170
Please.

13:49.370 --> 13:53.193
Any chance I could get
one of your watery domestic lagers?

13:53.950 --> 13:55.031
How's it going?

13:55.960 --> 13:56.950
Getting there.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.785
Have you seen Ernie?

13:58.920 --> 14:02.242
I need to go through a few things
with him before I submit the report.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.001
He hasn't been in.

14:04.130 --> 14:06.292
Scott said you made him
Sovereign Protector.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.290
He asked and I thought, "Why not?"

14:08.430 --> 14:10.842
It doesn't matter at this point.
It's not official.

14:11.470 --> 14:12.756
Gonna miss this place.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.978
I don't really want
to go back to London.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.556
Then do something about it.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.090
I mean...

14:19.690 --> 14:21.647
can't you call somebody?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.311
Don't you have any pull?

14:24.440 --> 14:25.771
I'm just the emissary.

14:25.900 --> 14:28.562
Can't you mess with the books,
buy us some time?

14:28.990 --> 14:29.980
And face an inquiry

14:30.120 --> 14:32.771
from the Accountancy
and Actuarial Disciplinary Board?

14:32.910 --> 14:34.230
-I think not.
-Come on, man.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.789
-This is your chance to be a hero.
-You're a 49er now.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.321
We need this place.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.201
I mean, look at Blaise.

14:42.880 --> 14:43.870
How sad is that?

14:53.100 --> 14:54.090
Ernie.

14:56.310 --> 14:57.129
Ernie.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.930
Hey. Sorry.

15:03.060 --> 15:04.892
I just... The door was open.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.350
-Damn.

15:08.530 --> 15:09.816
Is that a crow?

15:10.320 --> 15:11.697
Where did you get it from?

15:11.820 --> 15:12.946
I found him.

15:13.410 --> 15:15.117
He hurt himself somehow.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.789
How do you know it's a boy crow

15:19.210 --> 15:20.450
And why are you so sweaty?

15:20.580 --> 15:22.491
Well, I just rode my bike over.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.837
You know, for the exercise.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.207
And I just wanted to say what's up.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.048
Haven't heard from you in a few days.
Brought refreshments.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.791
-What did you do to your hand?
-Nothing.

15:35.850 --> 15:37.011
I banged it.

15:46.730 --> 15:50.143
Yeah, I've kind of been avoiding
the Lodge, you know.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.658
I'm too embarrassed
after my dumb speech.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.693
I haven't been over there, either.
Too depressing.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.401
And I don't want to run into Scott
and Connie.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.032
-So...
-Total radio silence.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.492
I've tried to call her.
a couple of times. Nothing.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.748
She's back with him, so that's it.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.501
Finally.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.086
Have you been watching the news?

16:13.010 --> 16:15.297
Everything's happening
like Gary said it would.

16:16.050 --> 16:17.051
Poor guy.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.057
Well,
I guess Jocelyn's just about ready

16:20.180 --> 16:22.091
to drop the hammer on the Lodge, huh?

16:26.980 --> 16:29.438
So, I was wondering... if maybe,

16:29.570 --> 16:32.107
you know, afterward,
you and I could still--

16:32.240 --> 16:35.449
Listen, I could say,
"Yeah, we'll keep in touch,”

16:35.570 --> 16:38.403
but when the door closes,
we'll go off and do our own thing.

16:39.290 --> 16:42.658
-That's how it happens.
-Yeah, but the knight-squire thing...

16:43.790 --> 16:46.077
You know? Like, you're...

16:47.790 --> 16:49.201
like my mentor.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.751
Mentor?

16:51.550 --> 16:53.678
If I'm your mentor,
then you're screwed.

16:54.510 --> 16:55.500
Look at me.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.846
I'm 59.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.803
I live alone with a cat and a crow.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.978
I have to grind
just to make it month-to-month.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.472
I'm not a knight.

17:07.230 --> 17:08.811
I'm a toilet salesman.

17:09.690 --> 17:10.851
Do you understand?

17:10.980 --> 17:13.186
-Well, yeah, sure--
-Listen to me.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.358
There's no magic out there,
no shortcuts. It's just the grind.

17:16.490 --> 17:17.730
Every day, the grind.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.486
And the sooner you accept that...

17:32.130 --> 17:34.337
Get your life together, Dud.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.382
Start thinking long-term.

17:39.140 --> 17:40.426
Don't end up like me.

17:54.530 --> 17:56.521
So, my cousin is baptizing his son.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.105
I'm the godfather.

17:58.530 --> 17:59.691
Oh, congrats, man.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.360
Yeah. I...

18:01.990 --> 18:05.369
I just don't know that I'm ready
for that kind of responsibility,

18:05.500 --> 18:06.535
you know?

18:06.660 --> 18:08.742
I just hope that I can protect him

18:08.880 --> 18:11.372
and add to his happiness.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.622
What do you need to protect him from?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.467
I don't know. Like, wild animals.

18:16.590 --> 18:18.080
-Yeah.
-Car crashes.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.593
_ What if someone
tries to give him poisoned soup?

18:22.430 --> 18:23.636
Poisoned soup?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.556
I'm just coming up with examples.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.342
You could put poison
in any kind of food.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.471
-That's true. That's true.
-Yeah.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.430
Sorry, who would want to...

18:33.320 --> 18:34.810
poison your godson?

18:34.940 --> 18:35.771
Yeah.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.777
I mean, I don't know. That's...

18:37.900 --> 18:39.402
That's what I have to figure out.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.406
It's a mystery.

18:41.530 --> 18:42.520
Right.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.612
Hey! You're back!

18:44.740 --> 18:45.741
Hey!

18:45.870 --> 18:48.248
I've returned to Shamroxx.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.377
Like a dog to vomit.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.286
-Yeah.
-Liz, we heard about the Mingle.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.048
You... You jumped off the boat.

18:57.090 --> 19:00.299
Night sea journey, huh?
Yeah, we've all been there.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.750
Well, don't listen to rumors,

19:01.890 --> 19:04.257
but, yeah,
that's exactly what happened.

19:04.390 --> 19:06.381
But those people sucked.
I couldn't deal.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.932
But now I'm back,
can I get some tables?

19:11.350 --> 19:12.351
No.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.101
Sorry, Liz. I hired two new girls.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.232
They're young women.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.566
There's no shifts.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.521
You said I'd always have a home here.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.190
And I absolutely meant it.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.748
But more as a metaphor.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.872
Oh, God. I hate being manager.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.300
Making decisions that affect
other people's lives, it's too much.

19:43.850 --> 19:44.999
Forget it.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.925
Don't hate me, Liz!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.927
I really think
this is for your own good!

19:57.230 --> 19:58.220
Well...

19:59.240 --> 20:02.358
with all the chaos over at Orbis,
those security jobs are gone.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.198
I tried to get in touch
with Gary in the desert,

20:05.330 --> 20:06.695
but I haven't heard back.

20:07.370 --> 20:09.611
But we should get
new temp assignments in soon.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.240
Oh, no, I don't want temp work.

20:11.370 --> 20:14.749
I mean, I'll take it,
but I really need a career.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.956
OK. That's good to know.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.836
Office skills, computer programs.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.290
Is that something
you'd be interested in?

20:26.430 --> 20:27.966
Absolutely, yeah.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.261
Absolutely.

20:29.390 --> 20:31.722
Great. I'll get you in the mix.

20:31.850 --> 20:32.840
OK.

20:34.270 --> 20:35.260
Hey...

20:35.810 --> 20:37.938
Thanks for always
being there for me, Ross.

20:40.150 --> 20:41.140
Yeah.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.477
Yeah! Yeah!

21:13.600 --> 21:14.590
Yeah!

21:15.770 --> 21:16.840
Go free!

21:18.060 --> 21:19.357
Don't come back!

21:27.620 --> 21:28.439
Yeah!

21:52.680 --> 21:54.136
-See you later.
-See you.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.916
I thought I'd find you in here.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.161
You shaved.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.160
I know. I look really good.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.677
You know,
it kind of smells like piss in here.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.798
-Probably a homeless guy camping out.
-Yeah.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.721
Well, the "for lease" sign's gone.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.512
Maybe Mr. Lang
finally found someone to rent it out.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.438
Did something happen to your phone?
I tried calling you yesterday, but...

22:45.570 --> 22:47.231
It's at the bottom of the harbor.

22:48.910 --> 22:52.778
Yeah, my junior-exec training thing
didn't really go well.

22:52.910 --> 22:54.287
Oh, really? I'm sorry.

22:54.410 --> 22:55.400
It's fine.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.991
How is your real-estate deal?

23:14.850 --> 23:16.136
I miss him.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.142
I had a bunch of voicemails from him
on my phone.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.685
Now they're gone.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.771
I think you're right, Liz.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.321
About Dad.

23:36.450 --> 23:37.440
What?

23:38.200 --> 23:41.363
I think he spent his whole life
trying to give us everything.

23:47.670 --> 23:48.876
And it wasn't enough.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.137
No, it was enough.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.841
He knew this was all going away.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.848
-And he just couldn't tell us.
-Dud...

24:02.560 --> 24:04.938
I don't know what happened, OK?

24:05.060 --> 24:07.142
I just said all that stuff
because I felt it.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.850
I don't know if it's true.

24:12.990 --> 24:14.526
I was standing right here.

24:18.620 --> 24:23.205
I was standing right here... and he
asked me if I wanted to go with him.

24:23.330 --> 24:25.879
I said no because
I was too embarrassed about my foot.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.876
I was standing right here,
and I just...

24:34.260 --> 24:36.001
I just watched him walk out the door.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.638
-If I would have gone, I could have--
-No.

24:43.770 --> 24:45.340
-I could have--
-No.

24:47.770 --> 24:48.896
Listen to me.

24:50.230 --> 24:51.982
Hey, this is not on you.

24:52.990 --> 24:55.812
OK? It's not on me, it's not on Dad.

24:55.950 --> 24:58.521
It just... is what it is.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.453
Anything could have happened
to Dad out there.

25:04.290 --> 25:06.281
We will never know, Dud.

25:06.790 --> 25:07.780
And...

25:10.130 --> 25:12.007
we're just gonna have
to live with that.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.961
We're lucky we had him
as long as we did.

25:19.010 --> 25:21.513
We're the two luckiest assholes
on planet Earth.

25:26.770 --> 25:27.680
Yeah.

25:27.810 --> 25:29.357
The shop, you know...

25:31.320 --> 25:32.526
it was like a ship.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.771
He sailed it as far as he could.

25:39.410 --> 25:40.525
It got us here.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.030
Yeah.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.326
But where are we?

25:58.340 --> 26:00.388
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.845
Here.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.306
Where did you get that?

26:09.400 --> 26:10.219
Cockfight.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.475
I know, it's...

26:13.610 --> 26:15.521
I was gonna bring it
by your place later.

26:15.650 --> 26:16.640
It's three grand.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.025
No, keep it.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.520
Come on,
I don't want to owe you anything.

26:34.630 --> 26:36.041
Come back to the apartment.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.831
I gave it a good clean.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.502
No. No, I've got my own setup now.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.057
I don't want to be a burden anymore.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.390
Dud, it's...

26:55.070 --> 26:57.186
It's awful what happened to you.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.401
Your foot.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.690
You know, it's not so bad.

27:03.410 --> 27:04.229
Yeah.

27:04.790 --> 27:05.860
It's nice to know

27:06.000 --> 27:08.788
that the worst thing that could
happen to me already happened.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.491
Yeah, well, I just mean...

27:12.460 --> 27:13.700
we're the Dudleys.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.080
We're water people.

27:16.210 --> 27:17.962
You need to get back in the water.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.479
I... I heard something.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.406
I thought it might be a mouse.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.338
Are you just sitting there
in the dark?

27:57.670 --> 28:00.970
Is this a benevolent universe...

28:03.220 --> 28:04.676
or something else?

28:06.470 --> 28:08.711
Which way do the signs point?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.136
I don't know.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.011
Everyone thinks
they're on the right path.

28:17.270 --> 28:20.069
They can justify any failure

28:20.190 --> 28:22.773
because they assume
it's leading some place good.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.198
It's always the other person

28:26.330 --> 28:27.650
who makes the wrong turn

28:27.790 --> 28:29.656
and finds the Minotaur.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.070
Blaise...

28:32.330 --> 28:35.038
why don't you come downstairs?

28:38.750 --> 28:40.627
I couldn't handle med school.

28:42.130 --> 28:43.370
Or the seminary.

28:44.430 --> 28:46.387
Or the commune, or India.

28:47.970 --> 28:50.132
Then I found the Lynx and alchemy.

28:52.140 --> 28:53.972
This is just another dead end.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.237
Where have you been

29:10.370 --> 29:12.190
-Yeah. Who did you punch?
-Cairo.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.109
Have Scott and Connie been by?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.628
I haven't seen Connie,
but Scott's here.

29:20.630 --> 29:21.756
Where is he?

29:25.050 --> 29:27.291
-Sanctum Sanctorum.
-He's what?

29:27.430 --> 29:28.636
Hello, Melinda.

29:29.140 --> 29:32.428
It's ten o'clock here in California.

29:33.020 --> 29:36.092
My report should be with you
when you get in this morning.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.183
As you'll see,
it's pretty devastating.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.312
I've never seen fraud
and dereliction on this scale.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.896
It's worse than Belfast,

29:45.030 --> 29:47.021
although they weren't
running guns here.

29:47.780 --> 29:50.772
Anyway, that said, I feel...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.866
I feel strongly

29:56.000 --> 29:58.207
that it would be a huge mistake

29:58.330 --> 30:00.287
to close Lodge 49.

30:03.380 --> 30:04.791
What the hell is that?

30:04.920 --> 30:07.639
I'm Sovereign Protector. Get over it.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.047
You're Sovereign Protector
of nothing.

30:10.180 --> 30:11.591
There is no Lodge!

30:11.720 --> 30:12.881
I don't care!

30:13.020 --> 30:14.340
I'm on the wall!

30:14.850 --> 30:17.979
And as long as I'm on the wall,
if you're gonna talk to me like that,

30:18.100 --> 30:19.511
you're not welcome here!

30:24.030 --> 30:24.849
Don't!

30:24.990 --> 30:26.105
Stop that.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.912
We shouldn't let the actions
of one Sovereign Protector

30:41.040 --> 30:44.829
determine the fate
of a truly special place.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.166
God damn it, Ernie!

30:47.340 --> 30:49.672
And I believe
saving them from bankruptcy

30:49.800 --> 30:51.541
would be not a financial loss,

30:51.680 --> 30:53.842
but an investment in our future.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.471
These are good people...

30:58.440 --> 31:00.181
who have been dealt a losing hand.

31:00.310 --> 31:02.221
It's the fate of the working class.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.818
Or perhaps the middle class.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.700
Things are a little more fluid here.
Difficult to distinguish who's who.

31:10.070 --> 31:13.404
But I do know that
the more technology isolates us,

31:13.530 --> 31:15.737
the more we need places
like the Lodge.

31:15.870 --> 31:18.953
A place to meet different sorts
of people, face-to-face.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.412
My time here has been a revelation.

31:23.130 --> 31:24.336
For the first time,

31:24.460 --> 31:27.339
I see what it truly means
to be a Lynx.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.040
It means community...

31:31.090 --> 31:32.171
and brotherhood.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.790
You like that?

31:34.180 --> 31:35.170
You like that?

31:36.270 --> 31:38.056
Melinda, this could be beautiful!

31:38.480 --> 31:39.800
A renaissance,

31:39.940 --> 31:42.147
a fulfillment of Merrill's dream!

31:43.610 --> 31:45.726
So, please, ignore my report,

31:45.860 --> 31:47.430
and do whatever you can

31:47.570 --> 31:50.141
to help Lodge 49.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.782
Should we break it up,
or should we call Connie?

31:59.910 --> 32:02.789
No, let them do their thing.
It's probably for the best. Come on.

32:10.010 --> 32:12.832
You don't get
to have everything, Ernie!

32:16.220 --> 32:19.770
You don't get to be
Sovereign Protector and have her.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.512
I don't have shit, man.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.687
Larry ruined the Lodge.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.522
Left me with nothing.

32:30.150 --> 32:31.447
And Connie chose you.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.520
What the hell are you talking about?

32:38.120 --> 32:39.531
I thought she was with you.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.537
I haven't talked to her
in a couple of days.

32:43.580 --> 32:44.741
I thought she was with you.

32:45.670 --> 32:47.991
I was... I was giving her space.

32:49.090 --> 32:50.080
Me, too.

32:52.510 --> 32:53.716
Where the hell is she?

32:57.680 --> 32:59.341
She's sick, Ernie.

33:00.850 --> 33:01.840
What?

33:02.940 --> 33:03.930
She's...

33:04.060 --> 33:05.516
She's got a brain thing.

33:06.190 --> 33:07.680
She has seizures.

33:08.770 --> 33:11.319
Doctors gave her a couple of years,
but they don't know.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.067
I promised to take care of her.

33:15.780 --> 33:17.111
It was beautiful.

33:17.780 --> 33:19.077
And then we walk in here...

33:19.990 --> 33:21.321
and she sees you.

33:22.620 --> 33:23.610
Asshole.

33:47.310 --> 33:49.142
-Where are you?
-It doesn't matter.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.526
I wanted you to know I'm OK.

33:52.150 --> 33:55.142
And I figured I'd better call

33:55.280 --> 33:58.022
before you and Scott blew this up
into something stupid.

33:58.570 --> 33:59.696
Have you seen him?

34:00.910 --> 34:01.900
We talked.

34:05.580 --> 34:08.572
-He told you everything.
-Why did I have to hear it from him?

34:08.710 --> 34:11.918
-I had a right to know.
-Of course. But here's the thing.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.415
I didn't want to tell you.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.045
And I had a good thing going.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.045
I don't understand.

34:20.179 --> 34:21.170
Listen.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.347
Scott looked at me one way...

34:24.560 --> 34:26.187
you looked at me a different way.

34:26.770 --> 34:28.090
I needed both.

34:28.230 --> 34:30.187
I wanted both. Maybe that's selfish.

34:30.310 --> 34:32.016
You're damn right, and it's not fair!

34:32.150 --> 34:34.312
Stop whining.
It's unattractive in a man.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.811
So, how do I look at you?

34:40.909 --> 34:43.732
You, Ernie Fontaine...

34:45.250 --> 34:47.286
look at me like you always have.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.456
With stars in your eyes.

34:50.580 --> 34:53.379
What is wrong with you?
You sound like you're having a blast.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.501
I am, actually.

34:54.630 --> 34:56.667
Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.619
Nope.

34:58.300 --> 34:59.711
I'm gonna be gone for a while.

35:00.340 --> 35:01.341
On my own.

35:01.470 --> 35:03.256
No, don't do this, please.

35:03.390 --> 35:04.380
Calm down.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.269
I'll be back.
Things won't be like they were.

35:07.390 --> 35:09.051
As long as you get that, we'll be OK.

35:09.190 --> 35:12.228
But, baby, you don't have the time.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.680
Don't worry about time.

35:15.150 --> 35:16.276
I'm on a clock.

35:17.150 --> 35:18.140
So what?

35:19.070 --> 35:20.151
So is everybody.

35:21.070 --> 35:24.074
So, please don't worry about me.

35:25.660 --> 35:26.650
Everything...

35:27.660 --> 35:28.866
is gonna be OK.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.917
When will I see you again?

35:35.380 --> 35:36.370
I don't know.

35:37.210 --> 35:38.257
But you will.

35:39.550 --> 35:40.540
And I love you.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.481
What's going on?

35:59.570 --> 36:00.560
Welcome.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.026
There we are.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.112
Oh, there he is!

36:04.240 --> 36:05.867
Back from the continent.

36:07.450 --> 36:08.281
Well...

36:09.410 --> 36:11.617
the weather is a little nicer
at the Cte d'Azur.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.036
I love the rain.

36:14.170 --> 36:15.410
Where are you from?

36:15.540 --> 36:17.042
Oh, Anil, this is Connie.

36:17.460 --> 36:20.088
She's from California. Lodge 49.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.006
Lodge 49.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.462
That's where Jocelyn is
right now, yes?

36:25.550 --> 36:29.509
I hear that things are a little...
complicated out there.

36:30.060 --> 36:32.552
-Your Sovereign Protector is--
-Larry Loomis.

36:33.730 --> 36:34.800
Great guy.

36:34.940 --> 36:37.181
He just committed
a couple of felonies.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.146
That wasn't even the craziest part.

36:42.150 --> 36:44.107
Larry really lost it at the end.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.447
He had this whole story.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.150
Story?

36:51.080 --> 36:53.913
Do you know anything about
the "True Lodge"?

37:01.340 --> 37:02.626
Thirty-eight,

37:02.760 --> 37:04.171
39...

37:05.090 --> 37:06.080
40.

37:07.430 --> 37:08.636
Come in.

37:09.180 --> 37:11.763
I wanted to let you know
that I filed the Marseille report.

37:11.890 --> 37:13.130
-All's well?
-Yes, yes.

37:13.270 --> 37:15.807
But Stephen had some questions
about the amortization.

37:15.940 --> 37:18.227
-Fine. I'll get in touch.
-OK. Thank you, Melinda.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.778
There was an American woman
at the tavern earlier.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.277
She's from Lodge 49.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.606
Oh, that mess.

37:24.740 --> 37:27.061
-We're shutting it down.
-Yes, I've heard.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.190
This woman, Connie,

37:28.330 --> 37:31.322
she had some wild stories about
their Sovereign Protector.

37:31.830 --> 37:33.116
He claimed that his mother

37:33.250 --> 37:35.491
had infiltrated the True Lodge
in the '60s

37:35.620 --> 37:37.622
and stolen Merrill's scrolls.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.200
The True Lodge!

37:40.340 --> 37:42.707
Yeah, people will say anything
to cover up a crime.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.633
Ninety-five, 96, 97, 98.

37:57.690 --> 37:58.896
We have a problem.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.356
You helped me the last time.

38:02.990 --> 38:03.980
Did I?

38:04.570 --> 38:05.560
I took a mug.

38:06.700 --> 38:07.849
Those went fast.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.157
OK, your account.

38:11.160 --> 38:14.744
The outstanding balance is $80,513.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.280
That is outstanding.

38:18.250 --> 38:19.957
So, here's the thing.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.460
I've realized I don't have a place
in my life anymore for this debt.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.257
I hear that a lot, actually.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.678
That attitude helps
when you're paying it off.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.211
Oh, I can't pay it off.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.886
No, I'm just done with it.

38:34.980 --> 38:35.970
Here...

38:37.440 --> 38:39.147
is everything I have.

38:39.270 --> 38:42.183
Eighteen thousand,
eight hundred and eight dollars -

38:42.320 --> 38:43.856
the fruit of my labor.

38:45.650 --> 38:47.391
You want me to apply it
to your account?

38:47.530 --> 38:48.907
Take it as payment in full.

38:50.070 --> 38:52.823
You'll still owe more than $60,000.

38:52.950 --> 38:54.031
No, I won't.

38:54.160 --> 38:58.700
Look, I'm not entirely sure
if this counts as leverage, but...

38:59.830 --> 39:01.958
someone told me I have a death wish.

39:02.420 --> 39:06.300
I wasn't seeing it before, but I
think - I think - they were right.

39:06.630 --> 39:09.429
So if I don't
walk out of here today debt-free,

39:09.550 --> 39:12.679
I will probably throw myself off
the Vincent Thomas Bridge.

39:13.930 --> 39:15.091
Don't look at him.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.630
Look at me.

39:17.890 --> 39:21.554
I'm not trying to be a dick.
I just can't live like this anymore.

39:21.690 --> 39:22.760
That's just the truth.

39:22.900 --> 39:26.643
So when you say
I'll still owe whatever,

39:26.780 --> 39:27.986
that's not real,

39:28.110 --> 39:29.817
because you'll never get it.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.190
No matter what happens,

39:31.320 --> 39:33.482
I'll be dead before I pay what I owe.

39:34.240 --> 39:39.076
What is real is this $18,808 in cash.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.167
Let me speak with the branch manager.

39:47.340 --> 39:49.217
OK. Go ahead. Do your thing.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.961
Tell him what I told you. Every word.

40:12.860 --> 40:14.862
-Hello.
-Hey. What's up?

40:14.990 --> 40:15.980
Hey.

40:16.490 --> 40:18.697
-Nothing. Is everything OK?
-Yeah.

40:18.830 --> 40:19.820
I...

40:22.830 --> 40:25.959
I was just thinking about
goldbricking it the rest of the day,

40:26.090 --> 40:27.080
and...

40:29.460 --> 40:31.042
if you're not doing anything...

40:31.970 --> 40:34.211
maybe you would want to join me.

40:35.890 --> 40:36.880
Really?

40:38.180 --> 40:39.420
Yeah. Where are you?

40:40.480 --> 40:41.470
So, I...

40:42.100 --> 40:45.309
I interlock my pinkie
and my index finger?

40:45.440 --> 40:47.067
Like that? It feels weird.

40:47.190 --> 40:48.567
That's how Larry taught me.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.608
But he was horrible and I'm horrible,

40:51.740 --> 40:54.198
so just do whatever feels right.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.947
Just grip and rip, baby.

40:56.070 --> 40:57.117
Grip and rip.

40:58.740 --> 40:59.730
I hit it!

41:00.750 --> 41:02.400
I hit it! All right!

41:03.210 --> 41:04.245
Yeah.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.377
It's cool they let you drink
on the course.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.626
Muni life.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.126
Enjoy it while it lasts.

41:14.130 --> 41:16.292
So, she wouldn't tell you
where she is?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.847
Nope.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.301
Oh, my God.

41:19.430 --> 41:21.421
Maybe she just needs
a different doctor.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.471
I think Connie knows what she needs.

41:24.020 --> 41:26.853
That woman, she's a piece of work.

41:28.190 --> 41:29.897
She just told me not to worry.

41:31.610 --> 41:33.601
And that's what I'm gonna try and do.

41:35.110 --> 41:37.522
I think I should be able
to find something, you know?

41:37.660 --> 41:38.650
Yeah.

41:38.780 --> 41:41.033
How did you get into
industrial plumbing sales?

41:41.160 --> 41:42.491
I answered a classified.

41:42.910 --> 41:44.912
Twenty years later, here I am.

41:48.630 --> 41:52.419
"In loving memory
of a lying asshole.”

41:57.890 --> 41:58.880
Yeah.

41:59.430 --> 42:00.500
Yeah.

42:00.640 --> 42:01.960
Larry was a liar.

42:03.890 --> 42:06.018
Pretty much ruined everything
for everybody.

42:09.940 --> 42:11.226
But he did it for us.

42:15.280 --> 42:16.270
I mean...

42:17.570 --> 42:19.698
he did all that stuff
to keep the Lodge open.

42:20.530 --> 42:21.986
Keep everybody together.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.286
Give them a place to go.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.637
-The Lodge is gone.
-Yeah, I know.

42:43.770 --> 42:48.549
But I'll be here
at the same time every week.

42:50.440 --> 42:51.430
You hear me?

42:53.020 --> 42:54.067
Every week.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.856
So you'll always know
where to find me.

45:33.020 --> 45:34.260
Lodge 49.

45:34.390 --> 45:35.846
Jocelyn, it's Melinda.

45:35.980 --> 45:38.108
Oh, yes! I've been waiting--

45:38.230 --> 45:40.722
I heard your message,
and I was moved by your words.

45:40.860 --> 45:41.850
You've convinced me

45:41.990 --> 45:45.233
that it's in the best interests
of the Order to keep Lodge 49 open.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.658
I'd like for you to stay there
for the time being,

45:47.780 --> 45:48.906
if you don't mind.

45:49.530 --> 45:50.656
I'd love to.

45:51.370 --> 45:53.828
I did it! I saved the Lodge!

47:07.240 --> 47:08.230
Hey.

47:08.570 --> 47:10.026
I've been waiting for you.

47:15.450 --> 47:16.611
El Confidente?

47:17.040 --> 47:18.951
Yep. Come on, let's get going.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.629
I don't want to be stuck in traffic
on the 405.

47:22.670 --> 47:24.581
-What?
-We're going to Mexico.

47:24.710 --> 47:26.417
I got a couple of leads
on the scrolls.

47:27.220 --> 47:30.383
Larry said that if anything happened
to him, I could trust you, so...

47:41.850 --> 47:43.978
Hey. I don't think so.

47:44.770 --> 47:47.239
Don't think, Ernesto.
Just get in the van.

48:00.210 --> 48:01.200
Screw it.

48:02.130 --> 48:03.495
All right, let's go.

48:03.630 --> 48:04.620
All right.

48:13.550 --> 48:14.756
Hey, Dud.

48:14.890 --> 48:17.712
Hey. What's up

48:18.730 --> 48:19.720
Oh, nothing.

48:20.350 --> 48:22.648
Nothing. Just...
How was it out there

48:22.770 --> 48:24.727
It's great.
Why don't you get in the water?

48:26.270 --> 48:28.819
Yeah, I... Well, I don't have
any of my stuff and...

48:28.940 --> 48:30.396
Borrow it from Lou and Tommy.

50:35.860 --> 50:36.850
Oh, my God!

50:54.210 --> 50:55.871
Come on, guys! Come on!

50:56.010 --> 50:58.468
Come on! Everybody, come on!

51:44.970 --> 51:46.768
Dud! Dud!

51:47.390 --> 51:49.267
Oh, my God! Hey!

51:49.390 --> 51:52.849
I told you it was a shark.
