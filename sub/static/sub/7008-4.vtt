WEBVTT

00:10.492 --> 00:12.132
It's the closing minutes
of the World Cup.

00:12.195 --> 00:14.267
Brad Taylor steals the ball
and dribbles to the right,

00:14.297 --> 00:17.265
cuts back to the left, shoots!
It's a goal!

00:17.333 --> 00:21.336
Goal, goal, goal!

00:21.404 --> 00:23.138
Goal!

00:23.706 --> 00:25.206
Oh, yeah!

00:27.409 --> 00:29.678
So you're studying
hard today, huh?

00:29.745 --> 00:33.448
Yeah. I'm practicing
for the SAT test.

00:33.515 --> 00:36.251
Is this the part where
they ask you to make rain?

00:37.887 --> 00:40.055
No, I was just
taking the math test.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.758
Gosh, it was so hard I'm
scared to find out my score.

00:43.827 --> 00:45.627
Well, let's add it up.
How do we do this?

00:45.695 --> 00:47.566
Well, I already did the
adding and the subtracting.

00:47.596 --> 00:49.898
You have to take this number
here and divide it by four.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.366
Well, don't worry.

00:51.434 --> 00:53.936
Math is just simple logic.

00:54.003 --> 00:56.205
Let's see, two, two...

00:56.272 --> 01:01.075
Well, Dad, when you divide,
shouldn't the number get smaller?

01:01.143 --> 01:03.812
I've been dividing since I was a kid.
That is your score.

01:03.879 --> 01:06.581
Forty-two hundred, baby!

01:06.649 --> 01:09.351
Dad, the highest
possible score is 800.

01:09.419 --> 01:11.653
You know what?
I bet you added a zero to the 420.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.489
Don't be silly.
You add a zero to 420, you still get 420.

01:16.258 --> 01:17.792
- Yeah, you're right.
- Hi, guys.

01:17.827 --> 01:18.860
Hi.

01:18.928 --> 01:21.163
So what do you think?

01:22.064 --> 01:23.398
New hair?

01:23.465 --> 01:24.866
No!

01:24.934 --> 01:26.067
New pants?

01:26.135 --> 01:29.404
No! New couch!
New couch!

01:29.839 --> 01:32.708
What new couch?

01:32.775 --> 01:35.277
I cannot believe
that you didn't notice it.

01:35.344 --> 01:37.512
It's been here since
early this morning.

01:37.580 --> 01:42.049
I spent six weeks picking this thing out.
I love it. Love it.

01:42.117 --> 01:47.656
I'm gonna lie down here
and never get up. Ever. Never.

01:47.723 --> 01:49.891
Well, Mom, I got a
420 on my math test.

01:49.958 --> 01:53.795
What? Oh, my God!

01:53.863 --> 01:56.598
You're never gonna get into
UCLA with scores like that,

01:56.666 --> 01:58.400
no matter how
well you play soccer.

01:58.468 --> 02:01.770
I know, but I hate math. I'd rather
hit myself in the head with a hammer.

02:01.838 --> 02:04.038
Don't be too sure.
It really hurts.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074

02:54.690 --> 02:57.025
Does everybody know
what time it is?

02:57.092 --> 02:58.593
<i>Tool Time!</i>

02:58.660 --> 03:01.596
That's right!
Tim, Tim, he's our man!

03:01.664 --> 03:04.232
If he can't fix it, Big Al can!

03:09.505 --> 03:12.741
Heidi. Thank you, Heidi.
Thank you.

03:16.545 --> 03:18.617
Thank you, Heidi.
Thank you, everyone. Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

03:18.647 --> 03:21.483
I am Tim "The
School Man" Taylor.

03:21.550 --> 03:25.353
And, of course, you all know my
assistant Al "Husky" Borland.

03:28.624 --> 03:30.058
Thank you.

03:31.493 --> 03:33.428
Welcome to our
<i>Tool Time</i> salute...

03:33.496 --> 03:35.130
Food fight!

03:35.197 --> 03:37.865
To college.
To college.

03:37.933 --> 03:41.670
In today's competitive college
environment, a young man needs an edge.

03:41.737 --> 03:45.540
That's why we've taken that dorm room
and given it the old <i>Tool Time</i> twist.

03:45.608 --> 03:47.942
Ladies and gentlemen,
say hello to

03:48.010 --> 03:50.078
the man's dorm room!
The man's dorm room!

03:54.851 --> 03:57.652
Now, at first blush, this may look
like an ordinary college dorm room,

03:57.720 --> 04:00.154
but let's scratch that surface
a little bit and go deep.

04:00.222 --> 04:03.124
The operative word in this
dorm room is "efficiency."

04:03.191 --> 04:05.393
Most college students don't
have time to do laundry,

04:05.461 --> 04:07.929
so it piles up,
cluttering the workspace.

04:07.996 --> 04:10.499
Hey, roomie, what are we gonna
do with all this laundry?

04:10.501 --> 04:11.700
Not to worry.

04:11.768 --> 04:14.102
We've modified this
little trash compactor.

04:14.704 --> 04:15.737
Aha!

04:15.805 --> 04:17.406
Perfect.

04:30.018 --> 04:35.056
Hard to believe there's 16 weeks of
my dirty underwear in there, huh?

04:35.124 --> 04:38.460
Suppose your kid has a
Chemistry final tomorrow.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.729
He's got to do well,

04:40.797 --> 04:43.865
but the professor's got this silly bias
against students that, I don't know,

04:43.933 --> 04:46.034
blow up the chemistry lab.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.436
Allegedly.

04:50.706 --> 04:52.774
To help students
stay up late studying,

04:52.842 --> 04:55.176
our dorm room has
that added thing

04:55.244 --> 04:57.512
to give them
that jolt of energy!

04:57.580 --> 04:59.080
An oxygen bar.

05:00.416 --> 05:02.917
Yes, it comes with domestic...

05:02.985 --> 05:04.619
Mmm, Seattle.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.888
And imported.

05:09.525 --> 05:10.558
Mexico City.

05:13.862 --> 05:15.897
Well, moving on.

05:15.965 --> 05:17.365
Well, after a late night,

05:17.433 --> 05:19.401
most students have a hard
time getting up on time.

05:19.468 --> 05:24.639
So we've created a fail-safe wake-up
system with three stages of alarm.

05:26.342 --> 05:28.676
Well, for the light sleeper...

05:29.878 --> 05:31.145
I'm up.

05:34.182 --> 05:35.783
For the moderate sleeper...

05:41.223 --> 05:42.591
What was that?

05:43.826 --> 05:45.893
Just five more.

05:45.961 --> 05:48.362
For the stubborn sleeper...

05:48.430 --> 05:51.766
Get up!

05:59.508 --> 06:01.342
I've added one
more little thing.

06:01.410 --> 06:03.044
What?

06:03.111 --> 06:05.050
Let's say you're having the
captain of the cheerleaders over

06:05.080 --> 06:07.616
for a little
late-night studying,

06:07.683 --> 06:10.585
and you don't want
Flannel Boy listening in.

06:10.653 --> 06:11.920
What?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.100
Aren't you supposed
to be studying?

06:26.169 --> 06:29.037
Yeah, Mom wants me to be studying,
but I'm all out of brain space.

06:29.104 --> 06:31.139
All right. Well,
take a little break.

06:31.207 --> 06:33.175
Let's play a little out here.

06:33.242 --> 06:34.309
No, that's cool, Dad.

06:34.377 --> 06:35.977
Come on. Just do it.

06:36.045 --> 06:38.112
Do it now. Come on.
Work it. Work it.

06:38.181 --> 06:41.716
Work it. Don't turn your back
on me, girlie man. Shoot.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.555
Go easy on your dad, Brad.

06:48.957 --> 06:52.226
Hey, do I smell pork
by-products over there?

06:52.294 --> 06:55.997
Yes, indeedy. These are
bangers fresh from England.

06:56.064 --> 06:58.232
Hey, Tim and Brad Taylor,

06:58.300 --> 07:00.101
I'd like you to meet a
former student of mine

07:00.168 --> 07:02.303
from Oxford,
Simon Downing-Chubb.

07:02.371 --> 07:03.972
Hello, Taylors.
How's it going?

07:04.039 --> 07:05.540
Simon Downing-Chubb.

07:05.574 --> 07:06.807
So what do you do?

07:06.876 --> 07:08.442
I own a software company.

07:08.510 --> 07:11.117
Actually, he owns one of the largest
software companies in England.

07:11.147 --> 07:13.314
He's also a very
active philanthropist.

07:13.382 --> 07:17.952
Well, I'm involved in a foundation that
fights poverty and promotes world peace.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.389
Enough chit-chat.
What do you drive?

07:21.457 --> 07:25.760
I've got a Bentley, two Jaguars and
I'm restoring an Austin-Healy.

07:25.827 --> 07:28.229
Wow, I've got an
Austin-Healy myself!

07:28.296 --> 07:29.768
I thought that was
Jill's Austin-Healy.

07:29.798 --> 07:32.600
Technically, in the sense

07:32.668 --> 07:36.470
that she owns it and I'm
not allowed to drive it.

07:36.538 --> 07:38.740
Plus, neither one of them
can keep it running.

07:38.808 --> 07:40.575
Well, it is British.

07:42.478 --> 07:43.978
Well, you colonists
dumped our tea,

07:44.046 --> 07:46.447
so we get back at
you with our cars.

07:46.515 --> 07:49.083
Brad!
Study break's over!

07:49.151 --> 07:50.919
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Downing-Chubb.

07:52.321 --> 07:53.888
So Brad's a soccer player?

07:53.956 --> 07:55.761
One of the best high-school
players in Detroit.

07:55.791 --> 07:57.492
Thanks, Wilson.
I'm soccer-mad myself.

07:57.559 --> 07:59.460
I even bought my own team.

07:59.528 --> 08:02.897
The Birmingham Chubbs.
Are you a soccer fan, Taylor?

08:02.964 --> 08:07.135
Yeah, you know, it's okay.
I love the rioting.

08:07.202 --> 08:09.442
Well, you know, if Brad has a
game in the next couple of days,

08:09.472 --> 08:11.106
why don't you take Simon?

08:11.173 --> 08:13.145
He plays tomorrow afternoon.
Love to take you if you want to go see it.

08:13.175 --> 08:15.714
And after that, maybe you want to
take a look at the Healy with me

08:15.744 --> 08:19.880
and tell me why the wipers go
on every time I honk the horn.

08:19.948 --> 08:22.116
Sounds like a problem
with the radio.

08:26.922 --> 08:29.090
Do all Americans
drive like that?

08:29.158 --> 08:31.097
Yeah. We drive on the right
side of the road here, Simon.

08:31.127 --> 08:34.828
No, I meant 60 miles
an hour on the shoulder.

08:34.895 --> 08:38.433
No, you see, my dad calls
that the passing lane.

08:38.501 --> 08:41.006
All right, listen, guys, I gotta
kick around a few math problems.

08:41.035 --> 08:43.071
Great game, Brad.
You were top-drawer.

08:43.138 --> 08:47.776
That means "good job" if you
live in the mother country.

08:47.843 --> 08:49.781
Want to go out to the garage and
check out the Austin-Healy?

08:49.811 --> 08:51.011
Lead on.

08:52.648 --> 08:53.714
Voila.

08:55.617 --> 08:57.051
Oh, it's a lovely car, Taylor.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.552
Thanks.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.688
Just finishing having
it rebuilt, bottom up.

09:00.756 --> 09:03.524
But there's something
really funky in the wiring.

09:03.592 --> 09:06.260
All right, let's have a quick
peek under your bonnet.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.568
Simon, we just met.

09:13.635 --> 09:15.570
In England, they call
the hood the bonnet.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.171
I know that.

09:17.239 --> 09:20.975
It's just you Brits have a way of
sucking all the manliness out of a car.

09:21.110 --> 09:24.345
I think it was the Americans
who came up with the car bra.

09:27.449 --> 09:28.721
When you got a nice
set of headlights,

09:28.751 --> 09:32.786
you want to support them
with something, don't you?

09:32.854 --> 09:35.857
You know, I have to tell you, Brad
really is quite a soccer player.

09:35.925 --> 09:38.593
He's talented enough to play
professionally in England.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.928
You think he's that good?

09:39.995 --> 09:41.262
Yeah.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.030
I can't say the same
for your wiring.

09:43.099 --> 09:44.265
What do you want to do?

09:44.333 --> 09:48.236
I'll need a wire stripper
and a cold beverage posthaste.

09:48.304 --> 09:52.407
Here's your wire stripper. I'll get
you your cold beverage post-toasty.

09:55.477 --> 09:56.845
Hey, hitting those books, huh?

09:56.912 --> 09:59.447
Yeah. I already hit them.
Now I gotta open them.

09:59.514 --> 10:01.916
Guess what? Guess what
the Chubbster said.

10:01.983 --> 10:05.052
He says you're good enough to play
soccer professionally in England.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.488
No way!
Yeah.

10:06.555 --> 10:08.156
Wow! That's so cool.

10:08.290 --> 10:12.260
Awfully talented, frightfully
good, absolutely marvelous.

10:12.327 --> 10:14.595
Shaken, not stirred.
James Bond.

10:14.663 --> 10:17.565
- Bond, James Bond.
- Dad. Dad.

10:17.633 --> 10:19.000
- No, Goldfinger.
- Dad! Dad!

10:19.067 --> 10:20.301
- No, Goldfinger.
- Dad!

10:20.369 --> 10:22.103
Pussy. Pussy Galore.

10:24.973 --> 10:26.441
I'm trying to study here.

10:26.508 --> 10:28.742
Right! Right!

10:28.811 --> 10:31.846
Study! The boy must study! I'll
tell Moneypenny immediately.

10:33.548 --> 10:35.116
Honey, you're in for a treat.

10:35.184 --> 10:37.718
Your first banger's
almost off the grill.

10:40.422 --> 10:44.325
I can't wait.
What's in a banger anyway?

10:44.393 --> 10:47.828
A veritable zoo-full
of English animal innards,

10:48.964 --> 10:50.498
with just the right
amount of spices.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.299
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.036
I've had enough monkey
in my diet lately.

10:56.304 --> 10:57.404
Hi, Mom.

10:57.473 --> 10:59.206
Hey. How are you doing?

10:59.274 --> 11:00.979
Wait, what are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be studying?

11:01.009 --> 11:02.777
No, I don't have
to study anymore.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.146
Right.

11:05.214 --> 11:07.081
And what about the SAT tests?

11:07.149 --> 11:09.850
No, I don't have to take them.
I'm not gonna go to college.

11:09.852 --> 11:11.252
- What?
- Yeah.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.321
I'm gonna play professional
soccer in England.

11:13.389 --> 11:15.856
You're looking at
the newest Birmingham Chubb.

11:17.659 --> 11:18.959
What are you talking about?

11:19.027 --> 11:21.729
What the hell is
a Birmingham Chubb?

11:21.796 --> 11:22.930
Simon's team.

11:22.998 --> 11:24.666
Who the hell is Simon?

11:24.733 --> 11:26.234
The owner of the Chubbs.

11:26.302 --> 11:28.903
We're not getting anywhere.

11:28.971 --> 11:30.705
Simon's one of Wilson's friends.

11:30.772 --> 11:32.744
Dad invited him to the game the
other day and he came and told me

11:32.774 --> 11:34.112
I was good enough
to play professional,

11:34.142 --> 11:35.610
and I said, "Yeah.
I'm up for it."

11:35.677 --> 11:37.345
You're up for it?

11:38.580 --> 11:40.252
What makes you think
that your father and I

11:40.282 --> 11:43.284
would even consider
allowing you to do this?

11:43.351 --> 11:45.186
Well, Dad was the one
that told me about it.

11:45.254 --> 11:46.207
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.352
Your father knows about this?
He's in favor of this?

11:48.390 --> 11:51.091
Well, yeah. He seemed excited when
Simon told him how good I was.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.832
They talked about the whole thing
while they were working on the car.

11:53.862 --> 11:56.264
So while changing
a windshield wiper,

11:56.332 --> 11:59.967
your father single-handedly decided
to change your entire future?

12:00.035 --> 12:02.903
All right, who's ready
to suck down a banger?

12:10.712 --> 12:13.147
You can get a salad,
too, if you want.

12:16.584 --> 12:19.420
Tim, when I went to
work this morning,

12:19.488 --> 12:21.356
I had a son who was
headed for college.

12:21.423 --> 12:24.758
Now I've got a Chubb.

12:24.826 --> 12:27.895
Dad, I talked to Simon. I'm gonna
be playing professional soccer.

12:27.963 --> 12:29.163
What?

12:29.231 --> 12:31.833
Don't act so surprised. You're
the one that told him to do it.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.801
I have no idea what you
guys are talking about.

12:33.869 --> 12:36.771
You invited Simon
to go watch him play, right?

12:36.838 --> 12:40.008
You told Brad that he was
good enough to play pro.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.880
Have you lost weight?

12:48.584 --> 12:51.819
How could you tell Brad that it's okay
for him to play soccer in Europe?

12:51.887 --> 12:54.393
I didn't say that. I just passed
on Simon's compliment, that's all.

12:54.423 --> 12:56.662
But you know how much trouble
he's having with his schoolwork.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.158
I mean, telling him
that was like

12:58.226 --> 12:59.998
dangling a big, fat carrot
in front of a starving horse!

13:00.028 --> 13:02.200
Well, I didn't know the starving
horse would eat the big, fat carrot!

13:02.230 --> 13:03.531
Well, you should have!

13:03.599 --> 13:05.933
Excuse me, guys.
The horse would like to speak.

13:07.903 --> 13:11.405
Look, guys, this is a big opportunity
for me and I don't want to pass it up.

13:11.473 --> 13:15.342
Brad, you said that you wanted to play
soccer in college. What about UCLA?

13:15.410 --> 13:17.411
No, you guys wanted
me to go to UCLA.

13:17.479 --> 13:19.184
This is a chance for me
to get on the soccer field

13:19.214 --> 13:20.748
without killing myself studying.

13:20.815 --> 13:22.716
Well, what if going pro
doesn't work out, Brad?

13:22.818 --> 13:23.918
Yeah.

13:23.986 --> 13:25.791
Dad, you know it's gonna
work out, you've seen me play.

13:25.821 --> 13:28.189
Brad, you're gonna ruin your
chances to get a scholarship.

13:28.256 --> 13:30.091
Mom, if I go pro,
I don't need a scholarship.

13:31.694 --> 13:33.933
I don't believe this.
You actually expect us to just say,

13:33.963 --> 13:36.564
"Oh, yeah. Great. Okay,
pack up, go to England"?

13:36.631 --> 13:38.432
Well, you guys let
Randy go to Costa Rica.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.234
No. No, no, no. That's
not the same thing.

13:40.302 --> 13:43.404
He's down there for school. He's
still in an educational program.

13:43.472 --> 13:45.510
Well, Simon says it's gonna
be a great experience for me

13:45.540 --> 13:47.708
playing soccer
and living on my own.

13:47.776 --> 13:49.510
- What do you plan to do for money?
- Yeah.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.112
Simon says he'll pay me
£10,000 a year.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.181
Simon says that's
plenty to live on.

13:53.248 --> 13:55.282
That's simple for Simon to say.

14:00.021 --> 14:02.923
If Simon says jump off the London
Bridge, are you gonna do that?

14:02.991 --> 14:04.525
Simon wouldn't say that.

14:06.895 --> 14:09.797
I say you are going to college.

14:09.865 --> 14:12.333
And I say you're
going to college, too.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.674
Okay, Dad, so you're saying if you could've
gone straight from high school to <i>Tool Time,</i>

14:15.704 --> 14:17.805
are you saying you
would have gone to college?

14:17.873 --> 14:20.875
Well, of course he would have
gone to college. Tell him, Tim.

14:25.580 --> 14:27.281
You... They...

14:27.349 --> 14:29.550
The... No, there's...

14:29.618 --> 14:31.785
If that...
Those... They never...

14:31.853 --> 14:33.354
No one called.

14:34.356 --> 14:35.889
Tim!

14:35.957 --> 14:38.392
- There's...
- No, no, no. That's all I wanted to hear.

14:38.394 --> 14:41.028
No, no. I just stuttered then.
I didn't say anything.

14:41.096 --> 14:42.362
What was that about?

14:42.430 --> 14:44.098
Well, that question
caught me off guard.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.400
Well, you're on guard now.
Go tell him to go to college.

14:46.467 --> 14:49.470
Jill, look, if I had the
chance to skip English Lit

14:49.538 --> 14:52.139
and go straight to <i>Tool Time,</i>
<i>I probably would have done it.</i>

14:52.207 --> 14:55.509
That's fine for you, but that's not
the message I want our son to hear.

14:55.577 --> 14:58.383
He asked me a question, I gave him an
honest answer. What was I supposed to do?

14:58.413 --> 15:01.716
You do what most good
parents would do, lie.

15:09.558 --> 15:11.726
Good arm, Wilson.

15:11.793 --> 15:14.673
Well, thank you, neighbor. Simon
inspired me to dust off my cricket gear.

15:17.933 --> 15:20.501
Unfortunately, I'm having
trouble controlling my googly.

15:21.469 --> 15:23.504
Maybe you should
switch to briefs.

15:25.573 --> 15:29.811
No, Tim. See, the googly is the
cricket equivalent of a curve ball.

15:29.878 --> 15:33.114
Well, Simon certainly threw a curve
ball over here the other day.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.949
Did you know
that he offered Brad

15:35.017 --> 15:38.018
a contract to play for his
soccer team in England?

15:38.086 --> 15:40.220
Well, Simon said that
Brad was a great player,

15:40.288 --> 15:42.456
but Simon never said anything
about signing him up.

15:42.491 --> 15:46.861
I am sick of what Simon says!

15:46.929 --> 15:50.064
So I take it you and Jill don't
want Brad playing in England?

15:50.131 --> 15:51.999
Jill doesn't. I'm not sure.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.168
Brad doesn't care,
he just wants to go.

15:54.202 --> 15:58.205
Oh, well, I understand their positions,
but why are you on the fence?

15:58.273 --> 15:59.740
Well, you know,

15:59.807 --> 16:02.709
Brad asked me if I could
have skipped college

16:02.777 --> 16:05.612
and gone right to <i>Tool Time,</i>
<i>would I have done that?</i>

16:05.680 --> 16:08.416
And I couldn't say that I
wouldn't have done that.

16:08.483 --> 16:10.284
Ah.

16:10.351 --> 16:12.724
And you're afraid if you told Brad to
do something that you wouldn't do,

16:12.754 --> 16:14.121
you would be a hypocrite.

16:14.156 --> 16:15.957
Exactly.

16:16.024 --> 16:19.026
Tim, to be offered your dream
job at such an early age,

16:19.093 --> 16:21.061
that would be so flattering.

16:21.129 --> 16:22.797
I think anybody
would be tempted.

16:22.864 --> 16:24.298
So do I.

16:24.366 --> 16:26.800
You know, for example,
when I was young,

16:26.868 --> 16:28.902
I had to choose
between going to Oxford

16:28.970 --> 16:31.205
or becoming a professional mime.

16:37.646 --> 16:41.882
That certainly would have impacted
our relationship, wouldn't it?

16:43.919 --> 16:48.022
You know, Tim, if you had been offered
<i>Tool Time</i> when you were 18 years of age,

16:48.090 --> 16:51.058
do you think you would have missed
anything by not going to college?

16:51.125 --> 16:52.497
Of course I would've
missed college.

16:52.527 --> 16:54.047
That's where I met
a lot of my friends,

16:54.095 --> 16:55.801
and, you know, there's all sorts
of great stuff in college.

16:55.831 --> 16:57.498
You know, panty raids, keggers.

16:59.033 --> 17:02.703
And Chemistry class. They let
me work with real stuff.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.905
That's when you blew up the lab.

17:04.973 --> 17:06.006
Allegedly.

17:08.108 --> 17:11.278
College was more about expanding my
horizons. I learned a lot of stuff.

17:11.346 --> 17:12.945
So there you go.

17:13.013 --> 17:14.919
You know, it seems to me
you can have this talk about

17:14.949 --> 17:17.785
college with Brad
without being a hypocrite.

17:20.155 --> 17:23.124
What made you decide
not to be a mime?

17:23.258 --> 17:24.925
I talked myself out of it.

17:28.697 --> 17:29.964
Brad! Brad! Brad! Brad!

17:30.032 --> 17:31.132
What?

17:31.199 --> 17:33.067
Turn that thing off!
I want to talk to you!

17:33.135 --> 17:35.102
Well, if you're gonna
yell at me about England,

17:35.170 --> 17:37.075
you can forget about it, all right?
I'm making my own decisions.

17:37.105 --> 17:38.806
I'm not here to yell at you.

17:40.842 --> 17:43.044
I want to have a calm discussion

17:43.111 --> 17:46.046
about pro soccer
versus going to college.

17:46.114 --> 17:49.083
Dad, I just feel that the experience
I'd get playing professional soccer

17:49.150 --> 17:51.685
would make up for anything
I'd be missing in college.

17:51.753 --> 17:54.488
So you do admit you might miss
something if you don't go to college?

17:54.556 --> 17:55.990
Nothing important.

17:56.057 --> 17:57.724
Dad, and you even
implied earlier

17:57.793 --> 17:59.698
that if you could have skipped
college, you would have.

17:59.728 --> 18:02.396
When I thought about it,
I was wrong about that.

18:02.463 --> 18:04.498
Dad, this is such a big
opportunity for me.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.466
I mean, I'll be living
on my own, making money,

18:06.534 --> 18:08.436
and doing the one
thing I'm good at.

18:08.503 --> 18:09.974
What do you mean the one
thing you're good at?

18:10.004 --> 18:11.543
You're good at a lot more
things than just soccer.

18:11.573 --> 18:13.945
Dad, I'm a lot better on the soccer
field than I am in the classroom.

18:13.975 --> 18:16.715
You worked real hard this year and
you got your grades up, didn't you?

18:16.745 --> 18:20.981
Yeah, in high school. If I go to a school
like UCLA, Dad, they'll humiliate me.

18:21.049 --> 18:22.449
Where did you get
an idea like that?

18:22.517 --> 18:25.218
Grant Scott's brother
sent me a book from UCLA.

18:25.287 --> 18:27.087
I couldn't even
understand the cover.

18:27.155 --> 18:28.823
Well, you just gotta...

18:30.358 --> 18:31.525
Jeez!

18:34.296 --> 18:36.163
It's like a foreign language.

18:36.231 --> 18:37.865
That's my Spanish book.

18:41.602 --> 18:44.138
Dad, I'm talking,
like, a calculus book.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.144
Well, you know, you're not
supposed to understand this.

18:46.174 --> 18:48.374
That's why you go to college,
so you will understand it.

18:48.443 --> 18:51.045
Dad, I'm not gonna cut it at
UCLA or any other college!

18:51.113 --> 18:53.151
Okay? It's gonna be way too hard!
I'm gonna flunk out!

18:53.181 --> 18:55.515
Wait a minute. Is that
what this is all about?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.221
You're gonna run off to England
because you're scared?

18:57.251 --> 18:58.618
No, I'm not scared.

18:58.687 --> 19:00.192
You just said you were
worried about flunking out.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.359
You're gonna go across the
sea, go over someplace else.

19:01.389 --> 19:03.691
You know, I don't want
you becoming a mime!

19:06.728 --> 19:08.061
What?

19:09.864 --> 19:13.367
I don't want you to miss the
opportunity for an education

19:13.435 --> 19:15.736
because you're
afraid of messing up.

19:15.804 --> 19:18.372
Well, don't you ever
worry about messing up?

19:21.543 --> 19:23.744
Have you ever seen <i>Tool Time?</i>

19:25.747 --> 19:27.347
Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:27.415 --> 19:32.587
Look. Look, son, you get stronger
in life by facing your fears.

19:32.654 --> 19:34.689
You were real worried
about going to high school

19:34.756 --> 19:36.595
and you worked hard
and you got your grades up.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.459
College is just
a step like that.

19:38.526 --> 19:42.162
And you can do this, Brad.
You can do this.

19:42.230 --> 19:43.630
All right, I'll think about it.

19:43.698 --> 19:45.633
And think about this,

19:45.701 --> 19:49.303
half of the starters on the World
Cup soccer team came from UCLA.

19:49.370 --> 19:51.104
Dad, they finished last.

19:51.172 --> 19:52.740
That's why they need you.

19:54.509 --> 19:56.176
Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:56.244 --> 20:00.181
You get into UCLA, I will build you
a dorm room of your dreams, man.

20:00.248 --> 20:03.484
Just like on <i>Tool Time</i>. What
feature would you really like?

20:03.552 --> 20:04.552
Heidi?

20:10.325 --> 20:13.561
It's not a beauty pageant.
This is a fitness competition.

20:13.628 --> 20:15.095
Hi, guys.

20:18.433 --> 20:19.971
We were just watching
the Discovery Channel.

20:20.001 --> 20:23.804
Yeah, right. Brad, Brad,
your SAT scores came.

20:23.872 --> 20:25.439
I think I'll open
them a little later.

20:25.506 --> 20:26.774
No. No.

20:26.841 --> 20:29.242
No, we can't stand the suspense.

20:29.310 --> 20:31.545
- Here, Dad. You can open them.
- I'll open them.

20:35.283 --> 20:38.418
- Hold on. Don't open it yet.
- Don't open it yet.

20:38.486 --> 20:39.824
- All right, go ahead.
- Okay, I'll go ahead.

20:39.854 --> 20:42.056
- Wait, wait. Not, not yet.
- Not yet.

20:42.124 --> 20:44.725
Brad, honey, relax.

20:44.793 --> 20:46.560
Okay, go ahead.

20:50.665 --> 20:55.803
Eight-hundred-and-twenty-six million,
fifty-thousand and thirty-three.

20:56.705 --> 20:59.439
Dad, that's my
Social Security number.

21:02.477 --> 21:05.512
Hey, Brad, look. You got a
550 in math, 530 in English.

21:05.580 --> 21:07.080
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

21:07.148 --> 21:09.154
Cool. I'm gonna go call Samantha
and tell her the good news.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.818
- Okay.
- All right.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.320
- Cool.
- Cool.

21:15.890 --> 21:20.894
Do you realize how close we came to
having another son in a foreign country?

21:20.962 --> 21:22.395
What's with these kids anyway?

21:22.463 --> 21:23.802
Other people want
to come to America,

21:23.832 --> 21:25.799
these kids just want to get out.

21:27.836 --> 21:29.736
Do you think it's my cooking?

21:31.706 --> 21:34.074
You combine that
with this couch, and...

21:38.947 --> 21:41.382
Does everybody know
what time it is?

21:41.449 --> 21:42.783
<i>Tool Time!</i>

21:47.455 --> 21:48.989
That's right!

21:53.961 --> 21:55.796
Simon says he's gonna
pay me £10,000 a year

21:55.864 --> 21:58.632
and Simon says that's
plenty to live on.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.637
Is there a cigar in this thing?

22:03.704 --> 22:05.105
I know! I know!
