WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.889
- (Sally):
Previously on Being Human...

00:02.930 --> 00:04.625
- I'm pregnant, Josh.

00:04.670 --> 00:06.365
- Be gone, unclean spirit.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.435
- Exorcism?

00:07.470 --> 00:09.131
NO!

00:10.670 --> 00:12.172
- I know what you are.

00:12.210 --> 00:15.271
You deserve whatever
she does to you.

00:15.310 --> 00:18.348
(Women screaming) - Someone
has told the Dutch everything.

00:18.380 --> 00:22.214
- Your plan jeopardizes
the existence of us all.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.515
- Change or die.
- Bishop!

00:27.820 --> 00:30.551
- Bishop will be so pleased.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.024
- I was supposed to die.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.358
You have to finish this.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.027
(Gasps)

00:38.570 --> 00:40.698
- Prepare for what's coming.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.204
- (Sally):
Right before a big storm,

00:48.240 --> 00:52.814
I used to go with
my dad to the harbour...

00:52.850 --> 00:54.909
to look at the clouds...

00:56.550 --> 00:58.518
feel the air.

01:01.890 --> 01:06.020
There's an eerie stillness
before the sky cracks open...

01:06.060 --> 01:07.619
(Paper rustling)

01:07.660 --> 01:09.662
...a hush.

01:11.630 --> 01:15.294
You can feel
the storm gathering...

01:17.040 --> 01:20.476
smell the flood on its way.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.240
(Horns honking, siren wailing)

01:30.450 --> 01:31.588
- Oh!

01:31.620 --> 01:34.510
You know, I feel really
awkward walking around

01:34.560 --> 01:35.584
with a bunch of stakes
under my jacket.

01:35.620 --> 01:36.849
- You'll feel
a lot less awkward

01:36.890 --> 01:39.120
when some vampire's
ripping into your face.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.491
- Yesterday, one fell out,

01:40.530 --> 01:42.999
and I had to explain
to a roomful of nurses

01:43.030 --> 01:44.191
that I was whittling.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.164
That I'd
taken up whittling!

01:46.200 --> 01:47.497
Oh!

01:49.270 --> 01:50.908
Hey!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.339
Can we get you...

01:55.380 --> 01:57.200
anything?

02:00.650 --> 02:01.947
She looks like The Grudge.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.539
- She looks a little rough.
- Rough?

02:03.590 --> 02:05.786
If we videotaped
her and showed somebody,

02:05.820 --> 02:06.981
they'd be dead
in 3 days.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.282
- She was almost exorcized.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.925
She's weak.
- She looks like she's gonna eat our entrails.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.519
(Sighs)

02:12.560 --> 02:15.621
- It has only been a few days.
She needs time to heal.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.469
She'll be back.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.298
- As what?

02:20.840 --> 02:23.059
Don't leave me alo--
(Door slamming)

02:25.910 --> 02:29.175
So we're--we're gonna, uh...
We're gonna go to work.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.178
And so you just, uh...

02:31.210 --> 02:33.520
Just have a
really nice day.

02:33.550 --> 02:36.315
OK? Have, like,
a "me" day.

02:36.350 --> 02:39.320
And then maybe--maybe
some skin cream.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.828
Uh...

02:48.200 --> 02:49.725
(Siren sounding)

02:51.000 --> 02:54.095
Look, I'm--I'm sorry
about Rebecca, OK?

02:54.140 --> 02:55.289
I know you're
messed up right now.

02:55.340 --> 02:58.537
But if the Dutch are really
as badass as you say they are,

02:58.570 --> 03:00.402
don't you think that
Bishop has hightailed it?

03:00.440 --> 03:02.579
- He'd just go underground.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.442
He hasn't left Boston.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.279
- How do you know that? I mean,
maybe he's gone back to Romania

03:07.320 --> 03:10.244
or Slovenia
or Not-Scary Farm.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.782
- Boston is Bishop's.
He spent decades ensuring that.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.981
He's not going anywhere.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.215
- Maybe he's rebuilding.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.127
Maybe he's meeting with
architects and interior designers

03:18.160 --> 03:20.822
and he's building a new
green vampire lair.

03:20.860 --> 03:23.067
Maybe he doesn't
care about you at all.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.434
- I openly defied him, Josh.
Hegeman, Marcus...

03:26.470 --> 03:27.892
Rebecca.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.499
If he is rebuilding,

03:29.540 --> 03:32.032
he can't do a single thing
if he keeps me around.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.607
No vampire would follow
him if he lets me live.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.005
- Let's do an
ego assessment.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.145
Maybe we're thinking of
ourselves too highly.

03:38.180 --> 03:40.740
Listen, if--if Bishop
really does wanna kill you,

03:40.780 --> 03:43.386
why are we at work
and not at home

03:43.420 --> 03:44.581
where he can't
cross the threshold?

03:44.620 --> 03:45.883
- That's a brilliant idea.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.649
We'll just stay
in the whole time.

03:47.690 --> 03:50.079
Grey Gardens for the
supernatural. Don't worry.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.259
Whatever he has to
throw at me, I'm ready.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.098
- Aidan! What are you doing?

03:55.130 --> 03:57.690
Stop, stop, stop!
Aidan, stop!

03:57.730 --> 03:59.698
Stop it right now!
Let him go.

04:01.100 --> 04:05.503
I'm sorry, sir. I'm taking him
back to the psyche ward right now.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.235
- (Man):
You do that!

04:07.280 --> 04:10.375
- (Sally): When you know you're
gonna die a violent death,

04:10.410 --> 04:12.947
when that's the only way
you can die...

04:14.580 --> 04:20.087
it's all about the waiting
for that final storm...

04:20.120 --> 04:23.181
if the waiting
doesn't kill you first.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.264
- Wait, you're
telling me that

04:31.300 --> 04:33.894
the handyman wasn't in
fact a vampire hit man?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.931
- Shhh!
- You had me worried for a sec.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.268
You're not crazy.
You're just a paranoid freak!

04:38.310 --> 04:40.369
- The only way you stand
a chance against a being

04:40.410 --> 04:42.879
who is stronger and faster
than you and who loves to Kill,

04:42.910 --> 04:46.676
is to assume that everyone
you meet is one of them.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.228
- Don't tell me you're gonna stake the cougar now.
- Go on ahead.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.659
** The first thing
they tell you *

05:07.700 --> 05:10.499
* Is to breathe... *

05:10.540 --> 05:11.962
- Oh...

05:13.710 --> 05:16.873
Is it your blood that
makes you heal so fast?

05:18.050 --> 05:20.747
- The tattoo guy
was wigged out too.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.270
(Chuckles)

05:22.320 --> 05:24.641
* She's a picture you drew... *

05:24.690 --> 05:26.715
- Will it stay?

05:28.260 --> 05:30.683
- Forever...

05:30.730 --> 05:31.788
literally.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.924
- You're insane.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.052
(Chuckles)

05:35.100 --> 05:38.195
I'll be in the ground, and
you'll still have my name.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.408
* Now all you see is the sun *

05:43.440 --> 05:46.330
* Moon and stars **

05:49.240 --> 05:51.004
I want you to.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.345
- No.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.149
- I trust you.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.513
- Celine...

06:01.660 --> 06:04.982
You can't trust a...

06:05.030 --> 06:06.759
vampire.

06:08.430 --> 06:09.898
Not completely.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.595
- You'll stop.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.944
I know you'll stop.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.389
(Birds chirping)

06:53.480 --> 06:56.609
- I got super lightheaded
and chucked it in trauma.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.176
- Yeah, I think I may
have mopped that up.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.872
- People are gonna start
to think I'm pregnant,

07:01.920 --> 07:03.319
which I am.

07:03.350 --> 07:06.012
Look, I think I'm
even starting to show,

07:06.050 --> 07:07.859
which I can't be.

07:08.860 --> 07:09.986
- Whoa!

07:10.030 --> 07:12.158
- You should say you
don't see anything.

07:12.190 --> 07:14.192
- Are you supposed
to get sick this early?

07:14.230 --> 07:17.461
- Oh, I don't know! I've never
been pregnant before.

07:19.870 --> 07:22.089
Look, I can deal
with this pregnancy,

07:22.140 --> 07:25.440
but I can't deal with you
melting down and this pregnancy.

07:25.470 --> 07:28.337
If you want out,
you gotta tell me now.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.508
I... This is the time.

07:39.220 --> 07:40.619
(Sighs)

07:43.730 --> 07:45.152
- I'm here.

07:46.190 --> 07:47.692
OK?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.821
So...

07:52.800 --> 07:54.837
you're keeping it?

07:56.540 --> 07:58.963
- I don't--don't
know what I wanna do.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.980
I'm not getting an abortion
today, that much I know.

08:02.010 --> 08:03.239
- No, that's good,

08:03.280 --> 08:05.772
'cause I'm--I'm working
this afternoon.

08:05.810 --> 08:07.619
(Chuckling)

08:09.050 --> 08:10.814
(Sighs)

08:10.850 --> 08:13.057
- And my, um,

08:13.090 --> 08:16.253
hCG levels are elevated.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.025
To be accurate,
they're off the charts.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.466
- What does...
What does that mean?

08:25.700 --> 08:29.830
- It could indicate multiple
fetuses or a birth defect.

08:32.740 --> 08:35.674
I scheduled an ultrasound
for this afternoon.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.543
So hopefully,
you can make it.

08:38.580 --> 08:43.188
There are more tests.
We'll figure out what it is.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.488
(Siren wailing,
horn honking)

08:51.860 --> 08:53.498
- Ow...

08:53.530 --> 08:55.191
Bitch!

09:15.420 --> 09:20.210
- Still using that pretentious
old-school razor, Danny?

09:20.260 --> 09:22.183
So dangerous.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.922
What if you cut yourself?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.758
(Gasps)

09:40.480 --> 09:42.073
- Ah!

09:42.110 --> 09:44.306
(Grunting)

09:46.950 --> 09:48.577
(Breathing heavily)

09:48.620 --> 09:51.385
- That's what it feels like...

09:51.420 --> 09:53.252
to die.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.862
Groovy.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.484
(Gasps)

10:35.100 --> 10:37.523
- This can't be happening.

10:38.730 --> 10:41.040
- I have spent
the last 2 hours

10:41.070 --> 10:44.904
trying to figure out
a way to, uh, show myself

10:44.940 --> 10:47.773
without giving you
a heart attack.

10:47.810 --> 10:50.939
Although, this is an awesome
place to be if you do have one.

11:02.220 --> 11:05.588
- For a moment,
I thought you were a ghost.

11:05.630 --> 11:09.453
Maybe a deathbed visitation.

11:12.530 --> 11:15.295
- Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, you're not...

11:15.340 --> 11:16.239
- Sorry.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.177
I should have found a more
politic way to say it.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.474
Dying has made
me very blunt.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.069
- What's wrong?

11:26.680 --> 11:29.069
- It's otherworldly.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.088
You're exactly the same...

11:31.120 --> 11:33.157
minus the tragic sideburns.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.557
- Uh, OK, are you gonna
tell me what's wrong,

11:35.590 --> 11:38.457
or do I have to abuse my
considerable lack of authority

11:38.490 --> 11:39.753
and steal your file?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.029
(Sighs)

11:43.530 --> 11:46.090
- I had lung cancer years ago.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.704
And I guess it couldn't
live without me.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.637
It's back.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.208
All over.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.488
- Well, who's your doctor?

12:03.520 --> 12:05.488
Dr. Corjo?
Because he's the best.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.855
- I'm not here for treatment,
just morphine.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.824
No more chemo, radiation.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.498
I don't wanna eke out

12:13.530 --> 12:17.262
another 6 or 9 months
retching and sleeping.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.620
Mm-mmm.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.138
Whatever's left,
I wanna live it.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.834
I haven't even
told my daughter yet.

12:29.110 --> 12:30.976
She thinks I'm
getting treated here.

12:31.010 --> 12:33.718
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.742
That's why I'm in Boston.
She lives here.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.816
- Wha...

12:39.860 --> 12:43.888
Congratulations.
Um, I'm so happy for you.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.098
(Laughing):
You know what I mean.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.552
- Mm-hmm.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.362
And what about you?

12:53.200 --> 12:55.339
Who's the new girl?

12:55.370 --> 12:57.259
And don't tell me
there isn't one.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.574
- It's over.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.675
- Even your voice.

13:06.710 --> 13:09.771
You still sound
like you're 25.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.983
You could be one of
my daughter's boyfriends.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.084
Which makes me
the matronly mom.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.691
(Scoffs) This is criminal. I
used to be younger than you.

13:20.730 --> 13:23.961
- You're still beautiful.
(Scoffs)

13:25.330 --> 13:27.992
Take this.
Protect yourself.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.496
- No, no, it's OK.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.259
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- You won't.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.448
(Moans, gasps)

13:39.480 --> 13:40.948
(Groaning)

13:44.650 --> 13:46.744
So, Boston.

13:46.790 --> 13:49.816
This is the last place
where I thought you'd be.

13:52.490 --> 13:53.594
(Breathing heavily)

13:53.630 --> 13:55.223
(Knocking on door)

13:58.130 --> 13:59.859
- Put your hand there.
Are you OK?

13:59.900 --> 14:04.360
- Yeah. (Both laughing,
knocking continues)

14:04.410 --> 14:06.037
- I'm gonna get that.
All right.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.505
- OK. Ah...

14:10.950 --> 14:13.044
- There you are.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.744
- What are you doing here?
- It's funny. I was gonna ask you the same question.

14:16.780 --> 14:18.987
- (Celine):
Aidan, who's there?

14:19.020 --> 14:22.058
- Oh, are you thirsty?
I'm thirsty.

14:22.090 --> 14:23.728
It's been a grueling trip.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.494
I don't suppose you'll,
uh, have her invite me in?

14:30.530 --> 14:34.137
- Oh, you're not
setting foot in here.

14:34.170 --> 14:37.037
You had no right
to track me down.

14:37.070 --> 14:39.004
- What was I
supposed to do?

14:39.040 --> 14:40.474
You're taking
a vacation, you said.

14:40.510 --> 14:42.501
You need a little
time to yourself.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.939
Next thing I know,
5 years go by,

14:43.980 --> 14:45.778
and you're nowhere to be found
on the Eastern Seaboard.

14:45.810 --> 14:49.144
- And? You don't
control me anymore.

14:49.180 --> 14:53.185
I'm free, remember?
- Come on, Aidan.

14:53.220 --> 14:56.383
What are you doing?
Montreal? Her?

14:56.420 --> 14:57.751
Come on, I promised

14:57.790 --> 14:59.554
that we were gonna build
something bigger than us.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.126
Come home
and let's build it.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.367
- I'm not coming back.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.666
- Celine, is it?

15:07.800 --> 15:09.598
(Sighs)

15:09.640 --> 15:12.632
- Well, that's my business.
- Like Jane was my business?

15:12.670 --> 15:14.206
- Look, that was
20 years ago.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.744
- And I remember it
like it was yesterday.

15:17.780 --> 15:20.215
You're walking on
a thread, aren't you?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.945
You're trying as
hard as you can

15:21.980 --> 15:23.744
not to bite a chunk
out of her,

15:23.790 --> 15:26.748
drain her dry while she's
lying there next to you in bed?

15:26.790 --> 15:29.680
Hey, I tried that
for years with Jane,

15:29.720 --> 15:32.155
and it feels like your insides
are being stripped into meat.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.794
And for what?

15:33.830 --> 15:37.027
To wake up one morning
in a bed full of blood?

15:37.070 --> 15:39.220
- - Your concern
is touching, really.

15:39.270 --> 15:42.433
- Oh, you think you
can control yourself? OK.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.939
I'm all for freewill, man.
This is America.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.337
This is still the
land of opportunity.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.337
But it's your nature, man.

15:49.380 --> 15:53.817
That still, quiet voice inside
you that wants what it wants.

15:53.850 --> 15:56.171
Come on, it's time.

15:56.220 --> 15:57.710
(Church bells ringing)

15:57.750 --> 15:59.309
Come home.

15:59.350 --> 16:01.614
(Laughing)

16:15.670 --> 16:17.104
(Phone ringing)

16:18.140 --> 16:19.801
(PA beeping)

16:21.380 --> 16:24.008
(Man speaking on PA, indistinct)

16:26.750 --> 16:29.469
- I could have
decapitated him.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.552
- You're back!

16:34.990 --> 16:37.425
(Whispering):
Oh my God!

16:37.460 --> 16:39.019
This is great.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.859
No more zombie Sally.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.621
- I think it was slitting
Danny's throat open that did it.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.092
Brought me back.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.930
- What?

16:49.970 --> 16:55.875
- You saw how weak I was. After the
exorcism, I thought I was gonna blow away.

16:59.950 --> 17:04.079
And then I
saw him... shaving.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.384
He was so smug.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.809
And I wanted to kill him.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.384
If I had just
cut a little deeper,

17:12.430 --> 17:13.852
if I had a little
more control...

17:13.900 --> 17:15.527
- Whoa!

17:15.560 --> 17:17.221
Hey.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.839
You sound like you're
interning for Hannibal Lecter.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.929
- You think
this is a joke?

17:23.970 --> 17:26.803
I'm finally
figuring this out.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.104
I cut Danny open

17:29.140 --> 17:32.542
and then I was back, 100%.

17:34.580 --> 17:37.140
It felt so good.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.585
One shove while he's
waiting for the T.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.984
One swipe on the wheel
while he's driving.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.179
- No!

17:45.230 --> 17:48.052
Why is everyone
so kill-happy?

17:57.240 --> 17:58.935
(Door opening)

18:01.880 --> 18:06.272
- We gotta leave Montreal
as soon as possible, today.

18:06.310 --> 18:08.711
- Is this you trying
to keep the romance alive?

18:08.750 --> 18:11.014
- The guy at the door,
that was Bishop.

18:11.050 --> 18:12.848
- What?

18:12.890 --> 18:14.358
- Celine, come on!
Get ready now!

18:14.390 --> 18:17.257
- What about my family?

18:17.290 --> 18:19.782
- It's better if they
don't know, for them.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.299
- Or what? You mean
Bishop would kill them?

18:22.330 --> 18:23.820
- I'm gonna take
care of you, I promise.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.396
- No, no, no! I don't
wanna be taken care of!

18:26.430 --> 18:29.263
Just turn me!
Then Bishop can't hurt me.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.665
And you won't
have to be so careful.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.269
- I don't want
that life for you.

18:32.310 --> 18:34.039
- You want me to
throw away my life

18:34.080 --> 18:36.105
and follow you God knows
where! And for how long?

18:36.140 --> 18:38.074
Until you turn me in for the younger model.
- Oh, stop it!

18:38.110 --> 18:40.101
You don't think a part
of me wants to turn you?

18:40.150 --> 18:43.643
Listen, it takes everything
I have not to feed and Kill.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.443
There are days where all
I can think about is blood.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.379
I don't want you
to have to fight that

18:48.420 --> 18:50.627
or give into it,
because you would.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.549
You would hate me
if I turned you.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.662
You'd hate yourself,
- No, I only get one life.

18:59.700 --> 19:03.068
You get dozens, hundreds!

19:03.100 --> 19:06.832
And you want me to give
the best part to you.

19:06.870 --> 19:09.737
I can't spend my life
running away from him.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.669
I deserve better than that.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.941
I need some time to think.

19:16.980 --> 19:19.881
- Yeah, you know what?
Take your time.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.251
Cool off.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.021
I gotta go get some things,
but I am coming back for you.

19:24.060 --> 19:25.983
At 7:00, you can yell
at me on the train.

19:26.030 --> 19:28.294
But whatever you do,
don't leave the apartment.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.456
- Don't tell
me what to do.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.320
- Celine, I'm just
telling you

19:31.370 --> 19:32.963
what you need to
do to be safe.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.399
He can't--

19:35.970 --> 19:40.373
(Sighs)
Please, wait for me.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.378
- I don't know.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.174
I don't know anymore.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.941
- Celine, I am
coming back.

19:47.950 --> 19:49.714
I'm coming back.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.343
Please...

19:51.390 --> 19:53.711
<i>** I have never felt *</i>

19:53.760 --> 19:57.060
* What I feel for you *

19:57.090 --> 19:59.787
* But I feel as
though I know you **

19:59.830 --> 20:01.298
- Hey...

20:03.130 --> 20:06.919
So it's official. Nora's gonna
have a litter of were-babies.

20:06.970 --> 20:08.438
- You have to stop this.

20:08.470 --> 20:11.167
- No, there's medical
confirmation now, man.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.838
I mean, her--her hormone
levels are all whacked out.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.678
I'm gonna have to
tell her what I am

20:15.710 --> 20:17.178
and convince her
not to have--

20:17.210 --> 20:19.406
- Werewolves are made,
not born.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.645
- Are you delusional?

20:20.680 --> 20:22.819
I mean, do you personally
know any werewolves

20:22.850 --> 20:24.045
who've procreated?

20:24.090 --> 20:26.513
Whose offspring
you've--you've examined

20:26.550 --> 20:30.327
and know not to be
m-monsters or deformed?

20:30.360 --> 20:31.680
- Are you happy with her?

20:33.560 --> 20:34.925
- Yes.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.122
Yes, which is why
I wanna kill myself,

20:37.160 --> 20:38.264
because I've
ruined her life!

20:38.300 --> 20:40.462
- Well, then you need
to hold onto that,

20:40.500 --> 20:43.401
the good part,
what you and Nora have.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.034
The rest you can
work out when it comes.

20:50.110 --> 20:54.320
- Oh, and Sally's, like,
full-on murder ghost now.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.445
Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

20:58.220 --> 20:59.813
It--it's OK.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.258
(Jenny hissing)

21:04.590 --> 21:06.888
- Josh!
- Oh my God!

21:06.930 --> 21:08.420
- Josh!

21:08.460 --> 21:10.360
- What do I do?
What do I do?

21:10.400 --> 21:12.323
- Stake her
in the heart.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.735
(Aidan grunting)

21:15.200 --> 21:16.838
(Gurgling)

21:17.870 --> 21:19.304
(Panting)

21:19.340 --> 21:20.705
(Gasps)

21:26.910 --> 21:30.983
- Hey, guys, it's Danny.
I'm out of town for a few days.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.045
- What, did I scare you? Good.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.615
- You've got my cell.

21:34.660 --> 21:39.757
- Now you know how it feels, you sick,
murdering, piece of-- (Machine beeps)

21:39.790 --> 21:41.394
- Guys?

21:47.540 --> 21:48.837
(Door closing)

21:51.170 --> 21:52.604
Guys?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.802
- I'm right here, killer.

21:56.780 --> 21:58.202
And guess what...

22:00.010 --> 22:01.717
I'm better than ever.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.682
- Sally?

22:09.820 --> 22:12.050
She told me how
to get rid of you.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.899
The medium.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.120
You tried to kill me?

22:22.270 --> 22:24.034
Show your face!

22:28.510 --> 22:30.501
I wanna see you scream.

22:34.850 --> 22:36.375
(Scoffs)

22:36.420 --> 22:38.411
All right.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.039
- Whoa, what are you doing?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.572
- You can't haunt our house
if there is no house.

23:03.610 --> 23:06.875
- You're gonna burn down
our house? Seriously?

23:06.910 --> 23:08.878
Danny!

23:08.920 --> 23:10.809
Come on, get out!
Just leave!

23:10.850 --> 23:12.249
Come on!

23:12.290 --> 23:14.452
Get out, Danny!

23:14.490 --> 23:16.879
Oh my God! No!

23:16.920 --> 23:19.025
No! No!

23:19.060 --> 23:21.529
Danny... No...

23:21.560 --> 23:23.119
No...

23:24.170 --> 23:25.990
Stop it!

23:26.030 --> 23:28.362
Get out!

23:34.510 --> 23:35.875
Danny!

23:35.910 --> 23:41.440
If you're lighting up this
house, you're going down with it!

23:41.480 --> 23:43.710
- Oh crap!

23:45.690 --> 23:48.853
(Grunting)
- Maybe this is the best way.

23:48.890 --> 23:51.951
We both go.
End this craziness.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.621
But not before
I torch your nuts

23:54.660 --> 23:56.389
and shove them
down your throat.

23:59.770 --> 24:02.592
(Screams)

24:02.640 --> 24:04.631
- What the hell?
- Sally!

24:04.670 --> 24:06.536
- He's trying to kill me, again.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.232
- Aidan, it's Sally!

24:14.980 --> 24:16.573
(Glass shattering)

24:21.620 --> 24:24.260
- You know how long
I've wanted to do that?

24:25.560 --> 24:28.257
Are you done, my friend?

24:37.070 --> 24:38.708
(Breathing heavily)

24:38.740 --> 24:40.003
- Are you OK?

24:41.010 --> 24:42.933
- You can see her?

24:44.110 --> 24:45.509
Sally?

24:45.550 --> 24:47.917
- We can see her
because we're like her.

24:47.950 --> 24:49.509
- What?

24:59.760 --> 25:01.057
- Ahh!

25:01.100 --> 25:03.023
- No, no, no, wake up.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.664
Wake up.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.169
(Growls)

25:09.200 --> 25:10.804
- Don't do it!

25:10.840 --> 25:11.830
- He deserves it!

25:12.710 --> 25:14.075
Doesn't he?

25:14.110 --> 25:17.648
- Sally, if you kill him,
he'll be here forever.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.500
He'll haunt you!
- Please!

25:19.550 --> 25:20.915
I'll never come back!

25:20.950 --> 25:23.419
- He's lying!
He will never leave you alone!

25:23.450 --> 25:26.090
- Listen, I know what
it feels like to kill someone.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.281
You cannot live it down!

25:27.320 --> 25:29.254
- It doesn't matter!
I'm already dead!

25:29.290 --> 25:32.749
- You can have the house!
I'll give it to you! Please!

25:32.790 --> 25:34.258
- We've all killed here,

25:34.300 --> 25:35.699
except for you.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.095
We've all killed someone.

25:37.130 --> 25:38.768
Do not do this.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.768
You don't want to do this.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.564
- Unh...

25:42.600 --> 25:44.967
- No one deserves to die
more than you do.

25:45.010 --> 25:48.605
And nobody deserves
to kill you more than I do.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.075
But I'm not like you.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.600
(Danny breathing heavily)

25:56.350 --> 25:57.476
- Sally...

26:01.420 --> 26:03.457
- You didn't just get saved.

26:04.490 --> 26:05.753
What you're gonna get,

26:05.790 --> 26:08.452
you're gonna pray and cry

26:08.500 --> 26:10.923
and wish you were dead.

26:11.930 --> 26:14.467
- Ah...

26:16.040 --> 26:17.769
(Siren blares)

26:17.810 --> 26:19.869
(Indistinct chatter on radio)

26:24.350 --> 26:26.148
- (Man): ...what happened.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.511
- What do you want me to say?
I did it.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.552
I tried burning down my house,
my tenants' house.

26:40.130 --> 26:42.690
- Tell them why
you're really here.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.695
(Breathing heavily)

26:48.540 --> 26:50.269
- But actually, um...

26:54.110 --> 26:56.431
I killed my fiance...

26:58.610 --> 26:59.975
in the house.

27:00.010 --> 27:02.069
- And when did this happen?

27:04.490 --> 27:07.949
- My fiance, Sally,
she's haunting me.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.122
She's gonna kill me,

27:11.160 --> 27:15.358
her and the guys
who live here...

27:15.400 --> 27:17.459
if I don't turn myself in.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.320
- OK, son.

27:19.370 --> 27:21.031
It's OK.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.959
You're safe with us.

27:24.170 --> 27:27.299
We'll get it all sorted out
down at the station.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.839
- Josh...

28:07.820 --> 28:10.278
- Do you think Sally's OK?

28:11.220 --> 28:14.520
- I don't know.
I think she's relieved.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.082
- And Danny?
You think he's OK, too?

28:18.130 --> 28:20.189
I mean, should we
send him something?

28:21.760 --> 28:22.852
I'm joking.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.289
I can't believe I'm getting
that look from you.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.128
- You know that...

28:29.840 --> 28:31.467
You know that
I wasn't gonna kill him.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.966
- Yes, you were.

28:33.010 --> 28:35.229
- For Sally.
- Mmm.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.170
- Maybe a bit because of some
stuff I've been going through.

28:38.210 --> 28:41.214
- There it is. Yeah.
- But mostly for Sally.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.814
- When exactly
do you think

28:43.850 --> 28:47.809
we should have a conversation
with her about her taste in men?

28:47.860 --> 28:50.557
There's gotta be some
nice dead dudes out there.

28:50.590 --> 28:52.524
- You know,
Sally's gonna be fine.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.096
She doesn't need you and me

28:54.130 --> 28:57.225
hovering over her shoulder
with dating advice, either.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.592
- Why? Is that because
I'm sitting here

28:59.630 --> 29:01.132
waiting for a doctor
to tell me whether or not

29:01.170 --> 29:05.004
I've impregnated my girlfriend
with a mutated wolf baby?

29:05.040 --> 29:07.008
- Ha-ha! Whoa!

29:07.040 --> 29:08.735
(Clears throat)

29:08.780 --> 29:12.307
- Caught you talking about me, huh?
- No, no, no.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.602
- He's freaking out
about the fact

29:13.650 --> 29:15.379
that he knocked me up
in the break room

29:15.420 --> 29:18.048
the one and only time
we had sex.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.182
- Uh...

29:19.220 --> 29:21.018
- It's fine. It's fine.

29:21.060 --> 29:24.257
I get that you would tell your roommate. Seriously.
- Yeah.

29:24.290 --> 29:25.826
Yeah, no,
thank you for that.

29:25.860 --> 29:28.192
But I didn't tell him
about the break room.

29:28.230 --> 29:31.200
And I didn't tell him
about the singular-sex part.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.164
- Oh.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.634
- Congratulations.

29:34.670 --> 29:36.160
- Thank you, Aidan.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.565
- Um...
- Thank you.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.662
- I should go.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.301
(Exhales)

29:45.410 --> 29:47.048
- We were just
talking about--

29:47.080 --> 29:49.515
- Josh, seriously, it's fine!
- I know.

29:49.550 --> 29:50.540
- It's normal!

29:52.150 --> 29:53.618
Ah man...

29:55.220 --> 29:57.359
What I wouldn't give
for normal.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.684
- I'd give my life
to be normal.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.769
- Celine...

30:13.070 --> 30:15.903
you asked me
so many times, and...

30:17.910 --> 30:19.708
I think I'm finally ready.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.882
You don't have to die.

30:28.390 --> 30:31.587
You will never be sick,
ever, or weak.

30:31.630 --> 30:34.759
It's like raw electricity
running through your veins.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.451
Imagine the strongest
that you've ever felt,

30:37.500 --> 30:39.161
the most vital,
the fastest,

30:39.200 --> 30:41.897
and double it, triple it
times 10, times 20.

30:43.640 --> 30:44.937
- You'd turn me?

30:50.180 --> 30:52.342
You could've asked
earlier, you know?

30:52.380 --> 30:55.714
When I was 20
and wanted sex 12 times a day!

30:55.750 --> 30:57.889
- But you have had
a life and a family,

30:57.920 --> 30:59.718
and you can make
a better decision

30:59.750 --> 31:00.956
than when you were 20.

31:03.860 --> 31:07.455
- Is this about the girl?
The one who didn't work out?

31:09.700 --> 31:12.294
- I'm not trying
to replace her.

31:12.330 --> 31:13.820
I...

31:13.870 --> 31:15.292
Just, I wanna help you.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.035
Who was I to say no to you?

31:17.070 --> 31:19.129
I just wanna
give you something.

31:24.810 --> 31:26.949
- You do look different.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.744
I can see it now.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.043
It's in your eyes.

31:33.290 --> 31:35.713
They're... deeper.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.158
Older.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.021
(Exhales)

31:43.900 --> 31:47.427
I wanted to see
who Simone marries.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.790
That's my daughter.

31:48.840 --> 31:49.796
- Hmm.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.706
- If she gets married.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.633
I wanna see her kids,

31:54.680 --> 31:57.206
if they have
her black hair...

31:59.110 --> 32:02.319
But if I see them...

32:02.350 --> 32:05.513
I'll see them grow old
and sick and die,

32:05.550 --> 32:06.813
and Simone, too.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.011
Ah...

32:12.590 --> 32:14.524
I think I had my time.

32:15.930 --> 32:17.796
I had fun when I could.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.442
- Why weren't you there...

32:41.690 --> 32:43.351
when I came back for you?

32:43.390 --> 32:45.279
I don't blame you.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.220
I just...
I just wanna know,

32:51.270 --> 32:52.920
after all this time.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.090
- What is this?

33:26.630 --> 33:28.439
- You don't remember?

33:30.200 --> 33:32.339
We ran into each other
on the road,

33:32.370 --> 33:35.670
you silly girl,
leaving her apartment like that.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.312
- Where am I?

33:41.350 --> 33:43.978
- In a safe place.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.813
A quiet place.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.885
- Ahh!

33:51.930 --> 33:54.058
(Groaning)

33:54.100 --> 33:55.556
Dammit!

33:58.070 --> 33:59.799
What did you give me?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.889
(Breathing heavily)

34:07.070 --> 34:08.902
Did you turn me?

34:08.940 --> 34:13.275
- Oh no, no, no,
we just talked...

34:13.310 --> 34:15.244
mostly.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.010
- Where's Aidan?

34:21.050 --> 34:22.654
- You don't have
to worry about

34:22.690 --> 34:25.455
turning your life upside down
for him anymore.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.152
That's over.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.239
You said
you had a great time.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.501
- Ahh...

34:45.250 --> 34:47.605
I'm not gonna
give up on him!

34:47.650 --> 34:49.014
(Breathing heavily)

34:49.050 --> 34:50.916
Ahh!

34:54.020 --> 34:55.851
(Screams)

34:55.889 --> 34:58.985
- This isn't about
you and Aidan.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.520
You are nothing.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.394
You're a fly with
the lifespan of a fly.

35:04.430 --> 35:05.829
If he really loved you,

35:05.870 --> 35:07.622
if he really thought
you were his equal,

35:07.670 --> 35:10.093
he would have turned you,
like I did him.

35:10.140 --> 35:14.509
My blood is his blood.
He always comes back.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.929
- You mean he's always
leaving you,

35:16.980 --> 35:19.540
and you always have to
drag him back.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.776
(Breathing heavily)

35:27.550 --> 35:29.211
Unh!

35:29.260 --> 35:30.716
(Coughing)

35:39.270 --> 35:42.035
- I hope you're not
going to the station.

35:42.070 --> 35:44.437
Or, say, Canada.

35:44.470 --> 35:47.360
That train left
a long time ago.

35:50.140 --> 35:52.370
- He'll hate you forever.

35:52.410 --> 35:55.072
- No, you'll hate me forever,

35:55.120 --> 35:57.714
and Aidan will never know.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.044
To him, you'll always be

36:00.090 --> 36:01.979
this little French
what's-her-name

36:02.020 --> 36:03.886
who left when
the going got tough.

36:05.290 --> 36:07.657
- I'll never
keep your secrets.

36:07.690 --> 36:09.294
- Hmm...

36:09.330 --> 36:11.298
What about your family, Celine?

36:12.570 --> 36:14.538
Would you keep
my secrets for them?

36:14.570 --> 36:15.696
It's tiresome,

36:15.740 --> 36:18.095
but I'll kill them
if I have to.

36:18.140 --> 36:19.733
- No!

36:19.770 --> 36:21.101
No!

36:21.140 --> 36:22.801
(Crying)

36:22.840 --> 36:24.877
Kill me instead.

36:27.350 --> 36:28.977
- No.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.818
No thank you.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.239
I like this.

36:33.290 --> 36:35.088
This is good.

36:35.990 --> 36:38.152
- (Aidan):
You can tell me.

36:38.190 --> 36:40.329
- I was so young...

36:40.360 --> 36:42.499
headstrong...

36:44.530 --> 36:46.760
It was such a long time ago.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.731
You should be celebrating.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.175
You said Bishop's gone now.

36:57.210 --> 36:58.848
- I thought that...

36:58.880 --> 37:03.215
I was afraid because
I was waiting for him to...

37:04.420 --> 37:06.218
kill me.

37:07.490 --> 37:10.414
But I'm afraid of myself...

37:10.460 --> 37:11.928
of...

37:11.960 --> 37:14.452
who I will be
without him to hate.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.956
The past 40 years,

37:16.000 --> 37:21.962
everything that I've done
was me trying to not be... him.

37:23.670 --> 37:26.560
- Everything you did
was because you wanted to,

37:26.610 --> 37:28.009
good or bad.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.771
Hanging it on Bishop,
that's a cop out.

37:32.010 --> 37:34.650
- Wow. Is this what
you're like with your daughter?

37:34.680 --> 37:35.670
Tough love?

37:35.720 --> 37:37.370
(Laughs)

37:38.950 --> 37:40.588
- Oh, Aidan...

37:41.660 --> 37:43.014
We were happy.

37:45.730 --> 37:48.324
Figure out
how to do it again.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.197
That's what you can give me.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.328
- Oh...

38:23.400 --> 38:25.391
- What is it?

38:25.430 --> 38:28.536
- This is why your
hormone levels are abnormal.

38:28.570 --> 38:31.938
You're a little over
14 weeks, not 7.

38:32.840 --> 38:33.830
- What?

38:33.870 --> 38:37.579
- No, no, that's not right.
It can't be.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.446
- Is there something
wrong with it?

38:41.480 --> 38:43.972
- Take a look for yourself.

38:48.050 --> 38:49.358
Fetus looks great.

38:49.390 --> 38:50.380
- Ah...

38:50.420 --> 38:52.081
- Excellent growth.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.724
(Both exhale)

38:58.970 --> 39:00.768
I'll see you in a month.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.137
- (Josh):
Thank you.

39:03.170 --> 39:06.333
- She's gotta be wrong
about the dates, but...

39:08.310 --> 39:10.301
you totally impregnated me...

39:11.310 --> 39:14.974
with a tiny huge-headed alien.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.670
(Laughs)

39:16.720 --> 39:18.540
(Exhales)

39:28.500 --> 39:31.299
- To our future couch...

39:31.330 --> 39:35.836
brought to you by Sally,
who is finally free.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.502
(Laughs)

39:38.540 --> 39:41.840
And to Dad, say goodbye to
your life for the next 18 years.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.609
- (Josh):
Oh my God!

39:43.640 --> 39:46.575
- Um, I don't even know
what I'm gonna do with myself

39:46.610 --> 39:47.702
now that Danny's gone.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.071
- Oh, me neither,
because, you know,

39:50.120 --> 39:52.214
that saga occupied
a lot of my free time.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.912
- I'm gonna go back
to med school.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.054
Part-time.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.421
- Ah...
- I can do that.

39:58.460 --> 40:00.451
I wanna do something
for this kid.

40:00.490 --> 40:01.992
I don't want him, or her,

40:02.030 --> 40:05.568
to think that Dad is
a bed-pan refresher, you know?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.227
- I do.
- Yeah.

40:07.270 --> 40:08.362
- And that's awesome.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.166
But, please, drink your martini
before it evaporates.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.803
- (Both): Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.569
(Laughing)

40:25.890 --> 40:27.415
Ahh...

40:27.450 --> 40:30.420
- Oh crap...

40:31.830 --> 40:32.786
- Oh my God...

40:32.830 --> 40:35.197
How long has that
been there for?

40:35.230 --> 40:36.755
- You did it.

40:43.870 --> 40:47.761
- Um, that's not exactly what
I thought it would look like,

40:47.810 --> 40:49.972
just hanging there.

40:51.110 --> 40:52.703
Is that crazy?

40:54.350 --> 40:57.718
Like, Tony's door was just in
the middle of the cemetery,

40:57.750 --> 40:58.979
which was also weird.

40:59.020 --> 41:00.886
But this is like--
- Sally.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.059
- I know.
It's just all so sudden.

41:03.090 --> 41:04.785
I'm not mentally prepared.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.151
- You've been waiting for this.

41:07.190 --> 41:08.624
You've earned it.

41:08.660 --> 41:10.150
(Exhales)

41:15.500 --> 41:18.902
- I mean, how many ghosts
even get justice, right?

41:18.940 --> 41:21.705
Except for that chick
from The Lovely Bones.

41:30.550 --> 41:33.212
I wish I could
take you two with me.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.759
- I guess we all go
eventually, right?

41:43.560 --> 41:45.164
See you in 60 years.

41:47.100 --> 41:48.420
Give or take.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.000
- Do you know what's there?

42:00.650 --> 42:02.072
On the other side?

42:03.580 --> 42:05.218
- Send us pictures.

42:18.930 --> 42:20.591
(Screaming)

42:20.630 --> 42:21.961
(Grunting)

42:25.970 --> 42:27.233
Ahh!

42:27.270 --> 42:29.773
(Screaming)

42:32.710 --> 42:35.247
- (Josh): Oh my...
Oh my God! Aidan!

42:35.280 --> 42:38.113
Oh my God!
Oh my God! Aidan!

42:38.150 --> 42:39.948
Oh my God!

42:39.990 --> 42:40.946
(Breathing heavily)

42:40.990 --> 42:42.287
Hang in there, man!

42:42.320 --> 42:44.152
You're gonna be all right!

42:44.190 --> 42:45.521
You're gonna be OK!

42:48.360 --> 42:50.419
Aidan! Aidan!
Look at me!

42:50.460 --> 42:52.269
Look at me! Look at me!

42:52.300 --> 42:53.995
Stay with us!
Come on, man!

42:54.030 --> 42:56.169
You're OK!
You're OK!

42:56.200 --> 42:57.759
You're OK! You're OK!

42:57.800 --> 43:00.667
Aidan! Aidan!

43:00.710 --> 43:02.929
Aidan! Aidan!

43:02.980 --> 43:04.470
** T was looking *

43:04.510 --> 43:09.016
* For my hometown *

43:10.220 --> 43:12.416
Aidan! Aidan!

43:14.920 --> 43:17.309
<i>- *1waslost

43:17.360 --> 43:20.250
* And I couldn't find *

43:20.290 --> 43:24.761
* My hometown *

43:27.900 --> 43:30.835
* I was desperate in *

43:30.870 --> 43:32.759
* The midnight hour *

43:32.810 --> 43:34.835
