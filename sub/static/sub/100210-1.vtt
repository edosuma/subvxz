00:01.020 --> 00:02.860
My first year at William Penn,

00:02.870 --> 00:04.839
I thought I'd really
connected with the students.

00:04.840 --> 00:06.140
But then, over the summer,

00:06.150 --> 00:08.140
Barry and I saw "Dangerous Minds,"

00:08.150 --> 00:09.540
starring Michelle Pfeiffer.

00:09.550 --> 00:12.230
There are no victims in this classroom!

00:12.240 --> 00:15.513
Seeing that movie made me
realize I could go deeper,

00:15.514 --> 00:17.810
really get involved with
these kids, which they need,

00:17.820 --> 00:21.380
because they are dealing
with a lot of scary stuff.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.610
For my second year back,

00:22.620 --> 00:24.610
I was determined to get
all up in their business

00:24.620 --> 00:26.280
by going full Pfeiffer.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.910
_

00:33.370 --> 00:36.040
Good. I got your attention.

00:39.230 --> 00:41.420
Sextuplets. Six notes per measure.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.840
Oh, yeah, we're goin' there.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.230
Oh, come on.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.100
Welcome to Guitar 2. Any questions?

00:46.250 --> 00:47.840
Yeah, why are you dressed
like Olivia Newton-John

00:47.850 --> 00:49.000
at the end of "Grease"?

00:50.170 --> 00:51.190
I'm not.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.790
I'm dressed like your worst nightmare...

00:52.920 --> 00:54.549
a teacher who cares.

01:02.010 --> 01:03.800
The curriculum says the
first song we're learning

01:03.810 --> 01:05.099
is "Row, Row, Row Your Boat."

01:06.620 --> 01:07.740
That's not real-life stuff.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.680
How many of you have
ever even rowed a boat?

01:11.030 --> 01:12.870
But was it gently down a stream?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.070
Exactly.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.940
I want to teach music that speaks to me,

01:18.050 --> 01:19.059
like Fiona Apple.

01:19.060 --> 01:21.370
What song speaks to you, Bobby Maloney?

01:21.480 --> 01:24.080
Is "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"
definitely off the table?

01:24.890 --> 01:26.260
What about you, Aaron Rubin?

01:26.310 --> 01:27.430
"Who Let the Dogs Out"?

01:28.040 --> 01:29.160
Ow!

01:29.180 --> 01:31.330
Why would you throw that?!

01:31.440 --> 01:33.390
As your prize for a great answer.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.340
Next time, you should try
throwing it to somebody

01:35.350 --> 01:36.960
with better hand-eye coordination.

01:37.070 --> 01:39.660
Like my blind grandma.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.350
Sure, Ronnie. Laugh through the pain.

01:42.410 --> 01:44.530
But having a blind grandma sounds heavy.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.580
If you ever want to rap about it...

01:46.630 --> 01:48.300
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:48.410 --> 01:50.660
It's been hard 'cause she
has to touch my face

01:50.670 --> 01:52.990
with her weird old-lady
hands all the time.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.690
Veronica, when parents are stressed,

01:56.700 --> 01:58.370
sometimes, the children feel the pain.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.139
But you're a resilient young woman.

02:00.140 --> 02:01.900
You will get through
this kitchen remodel.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.660
To make toast, I have to walk
all the way to the garage.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.120
Hey, there are no victims
in this classroom.

02:07.180 --> 02:08.789
But if you start to feel overwhelmed,

02:08.800 --> 02:11.680
you can call me anytime
on my new mobile phone.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.370
555-0159.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.840
I may take you up on that.

02:15.850 --> 02:17.670
My parents are picking out tile tonight,

02:17.730 --> 02:18.970
and they're a mile apart.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.100
Good luck.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.270
Rick!

02:21.280 --> 02:22.600
How was your summer?

02:22.660 --> 02:24.620
I went zip-lining in Costa Rica,

02:24.630 --> 02:27.090
and I fed fresh clams
to a capuchin monkey.

02:27.140 --> 02:30.310
Nobody tells you what to do
when you run out of clams.

02:30.370 --> 02:33.189
I heard you giving out your
personal phone number to a student?

02:33.190 --> 02:35.239
This year, I decided I wanna
give these kids more.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.070
Classic second-year-teacher mistake.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.520
They suck you in with their
needy, little faces,

02:39.580 --> 02:41.520
and the next thing you know,
you're at their house,

02:41.530 --> 02:43.920
pretending to be their
butler so you can impress

02:43.930 --> 02:46.450
some rich girl they met at soccer camp.

02:46.650 --> 02:47.659
On the plus side,

02:47.660 --> 02:50.120
I did learn how to make
a mean Beef Wellington.

02:50.130 --> 02:51.200
I would totally do that.

02:51.220 --> 02:52.590
As your mentor, I have to say

02:52.600 --> 02:55.010
that getting too close will
end up biting you in the ass,

02:55.020 --> 02:58.650
like a small but aggressive
monkey jonesing for clams.

03:11.220 --> 03:13.750
Barry, guess what. I'm
walking into the hallway.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.810
I know!

03:14.840 --> 03:17.380
The reception is so clear!

03:17.390 --> 03:19.050
I said it's clear.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.420
Wait, y... Hold on. You're breaking up.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.430
Breaking up!

03:23.440 --> 03:25.950
No! No, no! Not us! No,
we're not breaking up!

03:25.960 --> 03:27.590
Barry, are you crying?

03:27.600 --> 03:28.920
Mm.

03:28.930 --> 03:30.350
This thing is a miracle.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.340
Wow. Looks like Lainey Lewis
joined the space program

03:33.350 --> 03:34.359
over the summer.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.690
Barry and I got them so we can stay

03:35.700 --> 03:37.384
in constant contact with each other.

03:37.390 --> 03:38.480
We are crushing

03:38.490 --> 03:40.300
the long-distance-relationship thing.

03:40.310 --> 03:42.809
So, you guys made it through
the summer, then? Ah.

03:42.810 --> 03:43.929
Man, that's... good.

03:43.930 --> 03:45.769
Still going strong,
like Brad and Gwyneth.

03:45.770 --> 03:47.599
Brad and Gwyny are Splitsville.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.100
But they got the same haircut!

03:49.110 --> 03:50.430
I had a pretty bitchin' summer.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.230
I, uh, I did the whole
Renaissance Fair circuit.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.490
I threw some pottery. Oh.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.030
You all have some Swedish
butter pots coming, by the way.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.030
So, where's this new teacher
we're supposed to be meeting?

03:59.040 --> 04:01.090
I just left a bunch of
unsupervised fourth-graders

04:01.100 --> 04:02.739
- to Clorox my gym mats.
- Oh!

04:02.740 --> 04:04.249
Well, here she is now.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.470
- Everyone...
- Hey!

04:05.480 --> 04:08.289
... this is our new biology
teacher, Ms. Wilma Howell.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.300
Hi.

04:09.310 --> 04:11.250
I was clever enough to steal Wilma away

04:11.260 --> 04:12.870
from my good friend the commandant

04:12.880 --> 04:14.320
at Valley Forge Prep.

04:14.330 --> 04:17.009
If you've never heard a Marine
colonel sobbing on the phone,

04:17.010 --> 04:20.120
it is actually... very unsettling.

04:20.130 --> 04:22.259
He's a good friend and
a real American hero.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.559
What do you got there?

04:23.560 --> 04:26.290
Treats on the first day, huh?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.600
Oh, are these mochi balls?

04:27.610 --> 04:29.100
Actually, mouse-y balls.

04:29.110 --> 04:31.730
Frozen baby mice I feed
to my classroom snake.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.529
That's... really upsetting.

04:34.530 --> 04:37.240
It's biology. Circle of life.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.199
Sadly, nothing'll shock these kids.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.890
They see worse out there every day

04:40.900 --> 04:42.640
in this snake-eat-mice world.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.410
Do I need to put my name on this?

04:44.420 --> 04:46.249
Uh, I think the whole
freezer's yours now.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.720
Uh, let me get my Lean
Cuisines out of there.

04:48.730 --> 04:50.380
What? It's how Coop keeps it tight.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.839
Must be a culture shock, Wilma,
coming from a military school.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.360
Well, if it helps ease
the transition at all,

04:55.370 --> 04:57.390
please feel free to call me Colonel Fun.

04:57.420 --> 05:00.050
Oh, by the way, Friday is Pajama Day,

05:00.060 --> 05:02.230
and that's an order from the colonel.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.369
Yes!

05:03.370 --> 05:05.280
All you folks here are
all so, uh, cheerful

05:05.340 --> 05:07.089
- and... nice.
- Thank you.

05:07.090 --> 05:09.670
We're actually trying to change
the official school motto

05:09.680 --> 05:11.769
to "Hakuna Matata."

05:11.770 --> 05:14.150
Yes, but we're getting a
surprising amount of pushback

05:14.210 --> 05:15.240
from Disney legal.

05:15.290 --> 05:17.260
I'm just a little confused

05:17.270 --> 05:19.220
as to what you have
to be so happy about.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.640
Based on my classes so far,

05:21.700 --> 05:23.160
your kids are a bunch of dum-dums.

05:23.170 --> 05:25.890
Ooh! New teacher coming in hot!

05:25.950 --> 05:27.060
Solid hire!

05:27.070 --> 05:28.210
We try to steer clear

05:28.220 --> 05:30.210
of labeling our students "dum-dums."

05:30.220 --> 05:32.640
Yeah, we like to refer to
them as "future achievers."

05:32.690 --> 05:35.060
That sounds like a nice way to
say "somebody else's problem."

05:35.110 --> 05:36.220
Well, thank you.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.270
I'm here to teach hard science,

05:38.330 --> 05:40.549
not coddle them with pajama parties.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.990
To be clear, the pajamas
are not for the students.

05:43.050 --> 05:44.479
No, that's a faculty thing.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.680
This is what I sleep in,
so I'm good to go.

05:46.740 --> 05:47.990
Wilma, I reach my students

05:48.050 --> 05:51.060
by getting in their faces
and into their lives.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.000
Which is why I'm taking
them all out to Six Flags,

05:53.010 --> 05:54.010
like Michelle Pfeiffer.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.460
That makes absolutely no sense.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.529
This is what I've been telling her.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.360
You drive a bunch of kids
to the amusement park,

05:58.370 --> 05:59.920
they start to treat
you like a chauffeur.

05:59.980 --> 06:01.290
And that's halfway to a butler.

06:01.340 --> 06:04.120
Rick, I really appreciate all
the help you gave me last year,

06:04.130 --> 06:05.130
when I was a newbie.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.760
It was adorable how pathetic you were.

06:06.810 --> 06:08.210
She was like Bambi in that scene

06:08.220 --> 06:09.860
where he's slipping on the ice.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.579
Bambi. Clumsy idiot.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.770
Yeah, but I'm not slipping now,

06:13.780 --> 06:15.200
and I don't need a mentor anymore.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.090
Well, as your mentor, I'd have
to advise against that decision.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.980
From now on, I want to
chart my own course...

06:21.030 --> 06:24.810
by being exactly like Michelle Pfeiffer.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.030
You mean like one of those teachers

06:26.040 --> 06:27.220
that's always there for their students

06:27.280 --> 06:28.580
when they have no one else to turn to?

06:28.630 --> 06:30.840
Plus, her bone structure.
The woman is flawless.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.430
It turns out taking 30
kids to Six Flags...

06:36.440 --> 06:38.120
- 'Scuse us.
- ... was prohibitively expensive.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.130
- So sorry.
- Popcorn run.

06:39.140 --> 06:42.110
I settled on a more
manageable class outing.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.530
Barry, guess where
you're calling me now.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.990
I'm in a movie theater.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.690
Shhhhh!

06:49.750 --> 06:50.840
Wait, who is this?

06:50.900 --> 06:52.290
Let me step outside.

06:52.350 --> 06:54.420
Yeah, I'm speaking on a mobile
phone, so I can go anywhere.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.710
Please do!

06:56.720 --> 06:57.990
Who am I talking to?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.520
This is WYSP 94.1 on your radio dial.

07:01.530 --> 07:03.729
Your name was chosen at
random to win tickets

07:03.730 --> 07:05.820
to see Fiona Apple tonight
at the Trocadero.

07:05.830 --> 07:07.090
Congratulations!

07:07.100 --> 07:08.220
Oh, my God.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.940
Are you serious? I love Fiona Apple.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Bring a guitar, because you're invited

07:12.010 --> 07:13.780
to jam with Fiona before the show.

07:13.790 --> 07:15.300
Just go to her tour bus and say

07:15.310 --> 07:16.700
"I'm ready for my Apple jam."

07:16.760 --> 07:17.760
And be persistent.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.519
Security may not be familiar
with your contest prize.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.990
Thank you so much.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.490
I literally can die now.

07:23.550 --> 07:25.570
Or at least after Fiona
and I become best friends

07:25.580 --> 07:27.989
and record a live album at Red Rocks.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.310
By the way, Lainey Lewis.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.350
Rock star by night, teacher star by day.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.530
Oh, crap! I forgot about the kids!

07:38.700 --> 07:41.000
Over the next few days, CB saw more of

07:41.010 --> 07:42.250
Wilma Howell's teaching style

07:42.260 --> 07:43.790
and found he didn't quite like it.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.759
What is going on?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.380
That new biology teacher's punishing us.

07:48.490 --> 07:50.650
I couldn't explain how
the human heart works.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.200
But who amongst us can?

07:52.260 --> 07:53.270
Everybody in there.

07:53.330 --> 07:55.150
Okay, you clowns are dismissed.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.990
Go disappoint some other teacher.

07:59.470 --> 08:02.050
I know you meant "clown"
as an insult, Wilma,

08:02.060 --> 08:04.850
but as a graduate of Barnum
& Bailey University,

08:04.880 --> 08:07.040
I take that as the
highest of compliments,

08:07.100 --> 08:09.340
so... thank you very much.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.440
Tom Scott. What are you up to, man?

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
He's not allowed to leave

08:14.510 --> 08:16.440
until he puts that
skeleton back together.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.570
I got a C-minus on my anatomy test.

08:18.730 --> 08:21.039
That Operation game is very misleading.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.710
You don't think you're being
a little bit too harsh?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.190
If anything, I'm getting soft.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.680
My last C-minus kid is that skeleton.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.300
Am I any closer, Ms. Howell?

08:28.360 --> 08:30.630
Tom, you've seen a person before, right?

08:30.690 --> 08:32.760
Well, yeah, but only with skin on.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.700
I've worked with your kind
at other schools, CB.

08:34.809 --> 08:36.210
You're the "fun" teacher.

08:36.260 --> 08:38.049
Hey, if the students are having fun,

08:38.159 --> 08:39.609
they don't even notice they're learning.

08:39.610 --> 08:40.780
Because maybe they're not.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.500
I'm less worried about entertaining them

08:43.510 --> 08:45.370
than making sure they're
ready to go out into a world

08:45.430 --> 08:47.979
that's not in the mood
to cut them any slack.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.110
Ms. Howell?

08:50.270 --> 08:53.260
I don't have my report on
the circulatory system.

08:53.310 --> 08:54.920
It's been a tough week.

08:54.930 --> 08:56.600
My... parakeet died.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.000
We had a memorial in the English class.

08:59.050 --> 09:01.890
We lit candles and we
sang "On Eagle's Wings."

09:01.940 --> 09:03.970
And I made a clever
adjustment of the lyrics.

09:04.030 --> 09:05.240
Yeah, we can all picture
what that adjust...

09:05.250 --> 09:07.379
I made it "parakeet wings."

09:09.110 --> 09:12.360
This must be a painful
time for you, Debra.

09:13.630 --> 09:15.500
I'll need you to bring me
in the dead bird, please.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.000
- What?!
- What kind of child

09:17.010 --> 09:18.640
would lie about a dead pet

09:18.750 --> 09:20.199
just to get out of an assignment?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.200
All of them.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.830
Worst-case scenario... I'm wrong,

09:22.930 --> 09:24.870
Debra brings in the bird, I apologize,

09:24.930 --> 09:27.990
and we have a really cool
specimen to dissect in class.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.060
Either the bird or your assignment

09:30.070 --> 09:31.230
on my desk tomorrow.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.322
Your call.

09:32.350 --> 09:33.769
This is so unfair!

09:33.770 --> 09:35.560
See? She gets it.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.490
I can't believe I fell for it.

09:38.550 --> 09:40.180
I'm standing there
with my stupid guitar,

09:40.190 --> 09:43.379
like a crazy stalker, pounding
on Fiona Apple's tour bus,

09:43.380 --> 09:45.830
when suddenly, I get dragged
off by her security team.

09:45.930 --> 09:47.620
If they don't call themselves
the "Apple Corps,"

09:47.630 --> 09:49.140
they are missing a bet.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.470
This cruel but ingenious prank

09:50.530 --> 09:53.420
was obviously perpetrated by
one of your jerk-dip students.

09:53.470 --> 09:54.600
She's doling out her number

09:54.610 --> 09:57.550
like a teacher who paints
houses on the weekend. Oh.

09:57.650 --> 09:58.950
That actually reminds me.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.320
I gave my number to one kid.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.020
And by now, it's being
spread all over the school

10:02.030 --> 10:03.030
like head lice.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.470
You need to figure out who did this

10:04.480 --> 10:06.400
and come down on them
like a ton of bricks.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.000
If anything, I'm gonna come down on them

10:08.060 --> 10:10.099
with a ton of understanding
and compassion.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.890
You crossed a boundary with these kids,

10:11.900 --> 10:13.329
and you lost their respect.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.590
Yes, and loss of respect
is no laughing matter.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.470
Unless you're the brilliant
Rodney Dangerfield.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.250
But even then, I can sense

10:20.260 --> 10:22.280
a certain amount of pain
behind the laughter.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.000
This is exactly when a
mentor comes in handy.

10:25.030 --> 10:26.819
When you finally come
to your senses, Lewis,

10:26.820 --> 10:28.910
I'm perfectly willing to be begged.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.680
For the record, I think it's
great that Lainey wants

10:31.740 --> 10:33.470
to be more open and
trusting with the kids.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.610
I refuse to see the world as
some dark Darwinian hellscape

10:36.620 --> 10:39.280
where the freezers are packed
full of dead baby mice

10:39.290 --> 10:41.500
that are easily mistaken
for popcorn shrimp.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.820
CB accidentally ate one shrimp-mouse,

10:43.880 --> 10:46.279
and now, all of a sudden,
he has a grudge against Wilma.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.700
She's outrageously strict
with her students, John.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.479
She's also an outrageously
great teacher, CB.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.490
Just go to her tour bus

10:52.500 --> 10:54.240
and say "I'm ready for my Apple jam."

10:54.350 --> 10:55.580
Wait. That's the radio guy.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.810
Were you in on it? Coop, what the hell?!

10:57.860 --> 11:00.640
No! All I did was confiscate
this Talkboy thingie

11:00.650 --> 11:02.270
from Aaron Rubin in my Spanish class

11:02.280 --> 11:04.120
'cause he kept making
it say "sacapuntas."

11:04.270 --> 11:06.349
- What does that mean?
- "Pencil sharpener."

11:06.350 --> 11:08.600
Ohh. Such a beautiful language.

11:08.610 --> 11:09.720
It was Aaron Rubin?

11:09.730 --> 11:10.730
Do you want me to call
him into my office?

11:10.740 --> 11:13.640
I've been practicing my
looks of stern disapproval.

11:14.690 --> 11:15.939
Are you doing it now?

11:15.940 --> 11:17.440
'Cause it actually looks friendlier.

11:17.490 --> 11:19.890
I am cursed with my
grandmother's kind eyes.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.320
I don't want to punish Aaron.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.000
He's having trouble making
high-school friends.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.420
That's why he acted out.

11:24.430 --> 11:26.320
I'm gonna sit him down and
figure out what's going on

11:26.330 --> 11:27.900
inside that dangerous mind of his.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.620
He's always been an awkward kid.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.940
Yeah, he has the body of a child

11:30.950 --> 11:33.550
and the head of someone
trying to sell you insurance.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.900
Aaron! Word's out!

11:36.960 --> 11:38.280
Ms. Lewis knows you pranked her!

11:38.290 --> 11:39.299
But it's weird.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.950
She hasn't called my parents,
no principal's office,

11:42.010 --> 11:43.920
and get this... when I
saw her this morning,

11:44.030 --> 11:45.500
she said, "Hi, Aaron."

11:45.560 --> 11:47.820
She's just messing with
you before she strikes.

11:47.830 --> 11:49.630
Just like that snake
in Ms. Howell's class

11:49.640 --> 11:51.180
plays with the mouse before eating it.

11:51.230 --> 11:53.430
Hi, Aaron. Can I see you for a minute?

11:53.490 --> 11:55.640
Me and Bobby are actually
in the middle of a...

11:56.040 --> 11:58.639
We'll finish that up later, buddy.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.930
Hey, Rick? You wanted to see me?

12:01.030 --> 12:03.450
No, Coop. You wanted to see me.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.620
"Coop, come see me. Mellor."

12:05.730 --> 12:08.270
And you are gonna be delighted
that you decided to stop by.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.700
Again, not my idea.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.400
You see, the thing is,
I currently have an opening

12:11.410 --> 12:12.749
in my stable of mentees.

12:12.750 --> 12:13.790
Y-Your stable of what?

12:13.890 --> 12:16.760
I'm mentoring you, man! Congratulations!

12:16.870 --> 12:18.320
See, currently, as a Spanish teacher,

12:18.330 --> 12:20.310
you are just bueno.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.970
But I can help you up your game

12:21.980 --> 12:25.510
until you are el professor excelente.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.730
Oh, I see. You're looking
for a rebound mentee

12:27.740 --> 12:29.240
because Lainey Lewis dumped you.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.990
I've had my eye on you for years.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.489
You got a lot of raw talent
just waiting to be molded.

12:33.490 --> 12:36.750
For example, let's take a look
at your current class formation.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.710
Now, you got a lot of
your weaker students

12:38.720 --> 12:40.490
riding the bench in the back.

12:40.650 --> 12:43.610
I say you move them down to the middle,

12:43.710 --> 12:45.230
and you flank them on both sides

12:45.240 --> 12:46.860
with some of your varsity
Spanish speakers.

12:46.870 --> 12:49.459
For example, like that exchange
student from "Barthelona."

12:49.460 --> 12:51.500
That kid is a friggin' natural.

12:51.610 --> 12:53.280
You build your offense around him,

12:53.290 --> 12:55.219
and then you blitz these scrubs nonstop

12:55.220 --> 12:58.280
with the "¿Cómo estás?"
and the "¿Cómo te llamas?"

12:58.340 --> 13:00.990
And you ride this kid all
the way to the postseason.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.120
That'd be summer school.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.859
I'm gonna be on a cruise with my family.

13:04.860 --> 13:07.200
Well, if you don't want it,
I can't want it for you.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.960
Yeah, I don't want it.

13:09.970 --> 13:11.040
You'll be back!

13:11.200 --> 13:13.750
So, listen, we both know

13:13.760 --> 13:16.159
what went down with the
Fiona Apple prank.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.669
I hate to see a good kid
getting hooked on pranks.

13:18.670 --> 13:20.220
You're sweating, Aaron.
You want a Snapple?

13:20.330 --> 13:22.600
Yeah, right! I see what
you're trying to do.

13:22.650 --> 13:24.949
There's Tabasco sauce in there. Or wizz.

13:24.950 --> 13:26.940
Trust me... I have no
intention of pranking you.

13:26.950 --> 13:28.080
That's exactly what you would say

13:28.090 --> 13:29.700
if you were going to prank me.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.740
But it's also what I'd say if I wasn't.

13:31.850 --> 13:33.360
I get it... you're in high school now,

13:33.370 --> 13:34.950
and you're feeling lost socially.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.539
You want to know what I turned to

13:36.540 --> 13:38.289
to find my way as an awkward teen?

13:38.290 --> 13:39.670
Grab that guitar.

13:39.730 --> 13:41.180
Let me show you a couple chords.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.569
What'd you do? You replace
the strings with razor wire

13:43.570 --> 13:45.739
so when I strum it,
I slice off my fingertips?

13:45.740 --> 13:47.280
What would I want with
your severed fingertips?

13:47.390 --> 13:48.520
You'd wear them to commit crimes,

13:48.530 --> 13:50.220
and then I'd get framed for it.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.650
Well, nice try!

13:51.700 --> 13:53.500
I'm outta here!

13:53.510 --> 13:54.510
Aaron!

13:55.660 --> 13:56.780
Hey, Aaron.

13:56.890 --> 13:59.300
I heard about that prank
you played on Ms. Lewis.

13:59.310 --> 14:00.880
- That was epic.
- Really?

14:00.940 --> 14:03.110
How'd you even dream up something
like that fake deejay thing?

14:03.120 --> 14:04.860
I would have just
wizzed in her beverage.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.250
I saw an opportunity, and
like most things in life,

14:07.260 --> 14:08.960
it's about timing and who you know.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.470
Totally.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.960
Well, listen, me and the
guys are gonna head out

14:12.970 --> 14:14.310
to see that movie "American Pie."

14:14.360 --> 14:15.470
You wanna come?

14:15.530 --> 14:16.700
Oh, my God!

14:16.710 --> 14:18.360
Me, go with you guys to a movie

14:18.370 --> 14:22.000
that's rated "R" for language
and adult situations?

14:22.050 --> 14:23.100
I'm in!

14:26.490 --> 14:29.630
Actually, Ronnie, instead
of going to the movie,

14:29.690 --> 14:31.130
why don't you go... yourself?

14:31.230 --> 14:32.600
Whoa!

14:32.610 --> 14:34.359
You're clearly in cahoots
with Ms. Lewis.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.300
No idea what you're talking about...

14:36.310 --> 14:38.570
or... what "cahoots" means.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.960
Whatever, weirdo.

14:39.970 --> 14:42.039
Hey, you want to catch
"American Pie" with us, nerd?

14:42.040 --> 14:44.310
See you 'round, Aaron.

14:44.370 --> 14:46.219
Wait. What?

14:46.220 --> 14:50.590
I blew my chance to
hang with the seniors?

14:50.600 --> 14:52.809
I tried to tell you...
there was no prank.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.000
So I pranked myself.

14:54.010 --> 14:57.260
And the most ingenious part...
I never saw it coming.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.659
This is all your fault!

14:58.660 --> 14:59.970
You giving around your number

14:59.980 --> 15:01.630
and trying to get in everybody's lives?

15:01.640 --> 15:03.079
What kind of teacher does that?

15:03.080 --> 15:04.539
It's too weird!

15:04.540 --> 15:07.119
I kept waiting for you to punish
me, like a normal teacher.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.470
I don't wanna punish you.
I want to help you.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.669
Well, if you wanna help me,

15:10.670 --> 15:13.330
just leave me alone.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.770
Okay. Wilma Howell has
gone nuts this time.

15:20.780 --> 15:22.909
She's keeping her whole
class after school

15:22.910 --> 15:24.700
as some kind of a group punishment.

15:24.730 --> 15:26.640
Standing out there on the
football field. Look at that.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.260
I'm sure she has her reasons.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.100
Maybe someone smacked their gum.

15:30.150 --> 15:32.610
In fairness, that is also
a pet peeve of mine.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.150
Well, your pet peeve better not die,

15:34.220 --> 15:35.860
or she'll make you dig it
up and bring it to class.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.870
Okay, fine. I will go out
and have a talk with her.

15:38.940 --> 15:41.300
I can always use another
entry into my cloud journal.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.950
Oh, you have a cloud journal?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.170
Wilma, is there some good reason

15:45.180 --> 15:46.960
that you have your whole class out here?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.570
And trust me, no one enjoys

15:48.580 --> 15:51.480
pointlessly staring at
the sky more than I do.

15:51.530 --> 15:53.830
Whoa! Look at that one, CB.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.500
It looks like Pat Sajak
riding a dolphin.

15:56.510 --> 15:58.309
We'll just be a little longer, John.

15:58.310 --> 16:00.310
Well, you have poor
Debbie O'Donahue out here

16:00.320 --> 16:01.700
in the direct sunlight.

16:01.740 --> 16:04.710
That pale child will burn
standing next to a light bulb.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.070
Yeah, hasn't Debra been through enough,

16:06.130 --> 16:08.070
after forcing her to
exhume her parakeet?

16:08.120 --> 16:10.030
Look, I've been hearing
some troubling things

16:10.040 --> 16:11.440
about your teaching methods.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.070
Full disclosure... mostly from me.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.840
But also from credible sources.

16:14.940 --> 16:18.480
Actually, I was lying about my parakeet.

16:18.490 --> 16:20.030
- What?!
- Why did you lie?

16:20.130 --> 16:21.780
To get out of my assignment.

16:21.790 --> 16:24.050
Diane Para-keaton is very much alive.

16:24.060 --> 16:26.260
Well, we're happy for you and the bird

16:26.270 --> 16:28.860
but sad you felt you had to mislead us.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.590
But Ms. Howell wasn't fooled.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.919
She saw right through
me and called me on it.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.260
So I did my report, and I got a B-plus.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.109
You earned a B-plus.

16:37.110 --> 16:38.920
I am very sorry, Wilma.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.090
You were right and I
was wrong about Debra.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.560
That said, I would hold 100
fake dead pet memorials

16:44.570 --> 16:48.030
if it meant truly being there
for one grieving student.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.890
The service you held for my tetra fish

16:49.900 --> 16:51.170
was deeply moving.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.079
Well, you said he needed
a Viking funeral,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.580
so we shot a bunch of
tiny flaming arrows

16:55.600 --> 16:57.110
at an empty matchbox.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.680
No, Quentin Tetra-tino
was really in there.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.380
He died from endocrine failure.

17:01.490 --> 17:03.090
It was very painful.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.220
Oh, that's great!

17:04.270 --> 17:06.060
There you go, CB... your one out of 100

17:06.069 --> 17:07.560
that wasn't yanking your chain.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.329
Well, my takeaway here is that we have

17:09.329 --> 17:11.540
a lot of excellent
teachers at William Penn

17:11.589 --> 17:13.589
with different approaches to teaching.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.809
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

17:15.810 --> 17:17.420
And if you stop by my class on Tuesday,

17:17.480 --> 17:18.480
you'll see two of them.

17:18.490 --> 17:19.630
Okay.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.940
Uh, one other question...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.359
why do you have your whole
class out here for punishment?

17:23.420 --> 17:25.130
Oh, it's not a punishment.
It's a reward.

17:25.190 --> 17:27.560
This class has been doing exemplary work

17:27.569 --> 17:29.270
in our section on the monarch butterfly.

17:29.370 --> 17:30.789
Look! Coming from the trees!

17:32.770 --> 17:34.330
Oh, my God!

17:34.380 --> 17:35.630
That's amazing!

17:35.640 --> 17:36.830
It's so beautiful.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.900
I don't mind that it's
covering up Pat Sajak.

17:42.090 --> 17:44.130
Hey, Rick, you seeing this?

17:44.290 --> 17:46.050
It's like a butterfly wonderland.

17:46.100 --> 17:49.490
Ah, the annual monarch
migration down to México.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.850
Your old stomping grounds, señor.

17:51.910 --> 17:54.890
Nope. I'm from Toronto.

17:54.950 --> 17:57.600
But it's a shame they're flying
out of the sun like that.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.580
Makes it harder to see.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.680
Here. Try this.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.830
Oh.

18:06.930 --> 18:08.790
Much better. Thanks.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.290
You've just been mentored.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.560
Welcome aboard.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.110
This is a transcendent moment.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.180
Thanks for sharing it, Wilma.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.460
Seems like the kind of occasion

18:17.470 --> 18:20.219
where some artsy type might
want to recite a poem.

18:22.090 --> 18:24.330
Come, my lady. Come, come, my lady.

18:24.340 --> 18:26.830
You're my butterfly. Sugar. Baby.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.530
Come, my lady. You're my pretty baby.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.059
You're my butterfly...

18:31.060 --> 18:32.970
Uh, okay. Maybe we should wrap this up.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.780
One more minute. You don't
want to miss the best part.

18:34.790 --> 18:36.359
The best part? How can it
get any better than...

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
The crows!

18:37.370 --> 18:38.500
Good Lord!

18:38.560 --> 18:39.910
They're eating the butterflies!

18:39.920 --> 18:41.080
Awesome!

18:41.090 --> 18:43.600
I'm really starting to
come around on these kids.

18:43.710 --> 18:46.040
You got a nice school here, John.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.750
Barry?

18:48.810 --> 18:50.910
Ms. Lewis? I-It's Aaron Rubin.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.530
Aaron? What's going on?

18:52.640 --> 18:54.300
Did I win another contest?

18:54.360 --> 18:56.650
- No. I'm in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

18:56.700 --> 18:59.330
I got caught sneaking in
to see "American Pie."

18:59.380 --> 19:00.990
And you called me?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.920
My mom and dad would kill me!

19:03.030 --> 19:05.680
In fact, you're the only adult
I could think of to call.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.919
- You just want to help me, right?
- More than anything.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.160
Hang tight. I'll be right there.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.130
I know what you're going to say,
Rick. I'm making a mistake,

19:14.140 --> 19:15.580
and I'm going to end
up that kid's butler,

19:15.590 --> 19:16.590
but I don't care.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.230
Aaron reached out, and I'm
going to be there for him.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.360
So prepare that Beef Wellington recipe.

19:20.370 --> 19:21.960
Actually, I'm impressed, Lewis.

19:22.070 --> 19:24.270
24 hours ago, that kid set
out to humiliate you,

19:24.280 --> 19:26.170
and he did so in spectacular fashion.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.259
Well, that's in the past.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.600
Everybody's still talking about it.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.210
But you handled it your way.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.550
And now Aaron is coming to you

19:32.560 --> 19:34.430
as the person he trusts the most.

19:34.490 --> 19:36.200
- That's huge.
- You think?

19:36.210 --> 19:37.330
Look, I put a lot of work

19:37.340 --> 19:38.920
into maintaining the godlike status

19:38.930 --> 19:40.450
I have with these students,

19:40.460 --> 19:42.080
but it comes at a price.

19:42.090 --> 19:45.010
I don't connect to them the way you do.

19:45.070 --> 19:47.580
Maybe the second-year teacher
can teach me something.

19:47.590 --> 19:49.450
Well, I had an excellent mentor.

19:49.510 --> 19:51.210
That's nice, but you can't come back.

19:51.220 --> 19:52.690
Coop already took your place.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.630
It was a whole new year at William Penn.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.400
Was I as cool as Michelle Pfeiffer?

19:59.410 --> 20:00.430
No.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.470
Was I the teacher I wanted to be yet?

20:02.480 --> 20:04.550
No. But I was on my way.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.320
And I had a lot of
wonderful teachers around

20:12.330 --> 20:13.880
to act as role models,

20:13.890 --> 20:16.939
each of us with our own
way of doing things.

20:16.940 --> 20:19.110
But we all had the same goal...

20:20.060 --> 20:22.780
... being there when the
kids needed us most.

20:25.380 --> 20:27.970
The great thing about cloud journaling

20:27.980 --> 20:31.670
is that every interpretation is valid.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.679
That one kind of looks like a manatee.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.689
Nope.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.059
You're wrong. You're way off.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.689
That's clearly Bob Barker
putting on a sock.

20:38.690 --> 20:41.189
I notice you tend to see a
lot of game-show hosts.

20:41.190 --> 20:43.910
That's not the Bob Barker who
hosts some tacky game show.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.130
That's the Bob Barker who
tirelessly advocates

20:46.140 --> 20:48.319
spaying and neutering your pets.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.239
Hey, look, a butterfly.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.579
Wrong again.

20:51.580 --> 20:52.740
You're not good at this.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.470
No, over there. You see?

20:54.480 --> 20:56.369
It's an actual monarch butterfly.

20:56.370 --> 20:58.449
Aw. Sweet little guy.

20:58.450 --> 20:59.460
He's on his way to meet his friends

20:59.470 --> 21:01.200
on their journey to Mexico.

21:01.210 --> 21:03.549
iVaya con Dios, amigo!

21:03.550 --> 21:05.130
Uh-oh! Crow!

21:05.140 --> 21:06.160
Fly away, little buddy!

21:06.170 --> 21:07.759
Use some evasive maneuvers!

21:07.760 --> 21:09.800
Do a loopty-loop!

21:09.810 --> 21:12.510
- Ohh. Ohh!
- Do...

21:12.520 --> 21:15.140
He neither looptied nor looped.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.100
Okay, I-I'm... I'm done.
I'm done. I'm done.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.080
Oh, look!

21:22.090 --> 21:25.440
That one looks like Alex
Trebek on a snowmobile!
