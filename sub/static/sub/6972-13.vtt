00:10.500 --> 00:12.500
Evan!

00:14.500 --> 00:17.700
Evan!
Where are you?!

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Evan!

00:21.400 --> 00:23.400
Evan!

00:26.100 --> 00:27.100
Evan!

00:27.100 --> 00:31.600
- Evan, hurry! Please!
- Nothing's coming out!

00:31.600 --> 00:36.600
...with winds in excess of 100 miles per hour. Currently,
the storm system is stalled 25 miles off the Florida coast.

00:36.600 --> 00:41.200
Again, the hour's lead story, Tropical Storm
Leroy has been upgraded to Hurricane Leroy.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.200
The entire Gulf Coast is bracing for its arrival.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.000
Damn it!

00:53.700 --> 00:58.600
Mom, is Dad going to be all right?
Mom? What about Dad?

00:58.600 --> 01:03.400
- Mom, what about Dad?!
- We need water. Right now!

01:07.600 --> 01:11.200
- Mom!
- Just do as I say, Evan! Come help me!

01:11.200 --> 01:14.800
Help me pull the washer out,
please, Evan, just help me.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.700
- Mom, Reggie's back here!
- Evan, let the cat alone!

01:18.700 --> 01:23.500
All right, unplug the machine, honey.
Unplug the machine.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.100
Pull that hose out of the wall.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.400
I'm going to pull. I need you
to get behind the machine and push.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.800
I'm going to pull, you push. We're
going to tip the washing machine over.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.300
We need to dump the water out.
All right, honey, push!

01:40.500 --> 01:41.800
Push!

01:41.800 --> 01:43.800
Push, Evan!

01:48.800 --> 01:53.200
Push, Evan!
Are you pushing?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.700
Evan!

01:57.800 --> 02:00.300
Evan, answer me!

02:00.800 --> 02:02.300
Evan...

02:03.000 --> 02:04.500
Mom!

02:08.300 --> 02:09.500
Evan!

02:10.000 --> 02:11.700
Let him go!

02:11.700 --> 02:14.000
Let go of him!

02:15.300 --> 02:17.800
Let go of him!

02:17.800 --> 02:20.300
Let him go!

02:22.600 --> 02:24.800
Let him g...

03:17.200 --> 03:21.800
Hi, this is Fox Mulder. You can
leave me a message after the beep.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.100
Agent Mulder, this is Arthur
Dales calling from Florida.

03:26.100 --> 03:31.600
I don't know if you're watching the news but we're
in for a hell of a blow in the next 12 to 24.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.100
I been through hurricanes, Mulder,
been through the alphabet.

03:35.100 --> 03:40.100
But I just got a distress call from my
neighbor down the road to set my teeth on edge.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.700
You don't have much time
to get to the airport but...

03:42.700 --> 03:49.000
...if you're the X-Files man you say
you are you better get your butt in gear.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.200
...a spokesman for the Collier
County Emergency Response Team...

03:53.200 --> 03:58.300
...is advising residents to stay off the roads and
either wait out the storm in a secure location...

03:58.300 --> 04:04.300
...or proceed to a county emergency shelter. Hurricane
Leroy remains some 20 miles off the Gulf Coast...

04:04.300 --> 04:08.300
...sending high winds and up to six
inches of rain onto coastal communities.

04:08.300 --> 04:11.600
As of yet, it has unleashed none of
its potential heavy destruction...

04:11.600 --> 04:16.899
...on a very nervous populace from Naples to Fort Myers.
The National Weather Service predicts Hurricane...

04:16.899 --> 04:20.000
...Leroy will make landfall in
the next three to four hours, ...

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
...and we'll be coming back to
you in a few minutes--

04:24.100 --> 04:30.000
We got no sign of anything amiss here at that residence
out on the spit. Place is all boarded up tight, over.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.100
Roger that. Maybe the occupants
have evacuated, over.

04:34.100 --> 04:37.100
Well, that would be the Shipleys,
but a neighbor called and says...

04:37.100 --> 04:43.500
...they couldn't have gone too far without their only
vehicle which is still in the carport out here, over.

04:43.500 --> 04:49.500
- Well. That sounds like a real mystery, don't it?
- It sure does, you dumb fathead.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.700
Well, it couldn't be that all the
planes out were fully loaded, huh?

05:13.700 --> 05:16.900
Mr. Dales, there's a reason that
people don't head out into hurricanes.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.400
Yeah. The hurricane's 20 miles offshore.

05:20.900 --> 05:24.300
- Mr. Dales, can we come in?
- Come in.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.400
Who's this?

05:30.400 --> 05:31.900
Special Agent Dana Scully.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.300
- Scully?
- She's my partner.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.600
Well, don't get too comfortable. You're
going to want to get right back out there.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.400
Out where?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.500
- Did you tell her what I told you?
- Yes, but she's...

05:45.500 --> 05:48.700
She's not the type that's easily persuaded.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.700
Is that so?

05:50.700 --> 05:57.200
What he means is I don't hear a story about a sea monster
and automatically assume it's the Lord's gospel truth.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.400
- Why did you bring her here?
- Well, she knows your reputation, ...

06:00.400 --> 06:05.400
...your early work on the X-Files and she
has a knack for getting to the bottom of things.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.400
Apparently, so does Mr. Dales.

06:07.400 --> 06:12.200
It's a good thing I have a reputation.
Otherwise, how could it be impugned?

06:12.200 --> 06:15.500
Look, Mr. Dales, I'm sure that there
is good reason for your alarm.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.600
I listened to the message that you
left for Agent Mulder about your friends.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.300
The Shipleys-- a young couple with a son.
Yeah, he lives out on the end of the sandspit.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.500
Sara called me in a panic.

06:25.500 --> 06:30.300
She said that something in the house
had grabbed Jack, her husband.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.500
- In the bathroom, you said?
- Yeah... of all places.

06:33.500 --> 06:37.800
It was your description that
caused Agent Scully's... dubiousness.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.400
No. Not my description.
No. That was Sara's.

06:41.400 --> 06:49.600
She said... that it had tentacles wrapped
around her husband's neck and choking him.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.600
And you have no reason
to doubt Ms. Shipley's report?

06:52.600 --> 06:57.800
No. Both she and Jack are marine biologists.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.900
Or at least they were.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.400
I fear the worst.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.500
She's missing, too?

07:06.500 --> 07:08.400
Uh-huh. Yeah.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.900
I got on the horn to the local
constabulary but they're about as...

07:11.900 --> 07:15.400
...helpful as a fart in a windstorm.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.700
I would have gone out there
myself but for my bad hip.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.600
It's not a night that anybody should be out in.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.800
Well, I don't see that there's a choice.

07:27.200 --> 07:32.100
If anyone wants to get to the bottom of all this...

07:38.200 --> 07:43.000
What is it that brought you out
here in the first place, Mr. Dales?

07:43.500 --> 07:46.800
I came down for the weather.

07:47.400 --> 07:52.400
Don't sneer at the mysteries
of the deep, young lady.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.800
The bottom of the ocean
is as deep and dark...

07:57.800 --> 08:00.600
...as the imagination.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.900
SHIPLEY RESIDENCE
9:14 PM

08:28.800 --> 08:30.700
Hello!

08:32.200 --> 08:34.600
Mrs. Shipley!

08:37.400 --> 08:43.000
At least it looks like they had the time and the
presence of mind to prepare for the hurricane.

08:44.400 --> 08:49.400
The place is all boarded up. It's from the inside.
It makes you wonder how they got out.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.200
Hello!

08:54.600 --> 08:56.600
Mrs. Shipley!

09:39.500 --> 09:41.100
Mulder...

09:41.100 --> 09:43.600
No sign of life.

09:43.800 --> 09:49.400
There's... something on the drainpipe.
I can't get it off.

10:01.300 --> 10:05.300
I don't know if I'm going
to need my gun or a harpoon here.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.900
How the hell did the cat
get in the washing machine?

10:25.900 --> 10:30.900
Maybe he was taking a dip... After he
finished boarding up the windows.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.500
Where do you think this leads to?

10:51.500 --> 10:53.500
Must be the bathroom.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.700
Dales told me the wife told him that the...
the husband was grabbed from the bathroom.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.700
- Mr. Shipley!
- Can you give me a hand with this?

11:02.700 --> 11:04.900
Well, howdy do!

11:05.300 --> 11:07.500
Yeah. Right like that.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.500
Keep your hands up there
where I can see them.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.400
Now who are you and what
the hell do you think you're doing?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah. Nice and slow.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.300
You can put the gun down. We're FBI.

11:20.300 --> 11:24.300
- Don't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida.
- Sir, we're Agents Scully and Mulder.

11:24.300 --> 11:28.300
- I can show you my ba--
- This is Deputy Greer. I'm out at the Sandspit Road.

11:28.300 --> 11:33.000
I've got two suspects over at the Shipley
residence. B and E, possible foul play, over.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.200
- We're out here like you. We're...
- Copy that, 54. Be advised we have no backup units available.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.800
Roger that.
I'm putting you under arrest.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.900
- We're out here looking for the Shipleys, too.
- You have the right to remain silent.

11:42.900 --> 11:46.800
- Arthur Dales called us.
- Anything you say can and will be used against you.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.900
You have a right to a lawyer.
If you don't have one...

11:48.900 --> 11:51.000
Does that name mean anything to you?
Arthur Dales?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.500
- I know Dales.
- All right.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.500
I got a call from him, too.
Drunk as a skunk. What's new?

11:55.500 --> 11:58.700
Well, what else would we be
doing out here on a night like this?

11:58.700 --> 12:04.100
You could be looters. For all I know,
you could be part of the Manson family.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.200
- Oh, no. You're gonna kill me.
- No, I'm not, but I'd like to.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.200
Deputy...

12:18.000 --> 12:20.800
The FBI?
For real?

12:21.100 --> 12:23.600
I'll be in the car.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.100
I gotta at least make out a report.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.400
No, no, no. Not before you help
me finish what you interrupted.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.200
Yes, sir.
May I have my gun, please?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
Thank you.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.100
Yeah. No... Thank you.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.100
No one in the bathroom.

12:58.100 --> 13:03.000
The deputy helped me pull off the plywood. There's no
sign of anything except more of that slime...

13:03.000 --> 13:06.100
...in the bathtub and maybe three
inches of water on the floor. It's weird.

13:06.100 --> 13:09.700
It's like somebody left the taps running
before they boarded up the door.

13:09.700 --> 13:14.800
Great. Mulder, they're threatening to close
the airport. I think we better get out of here.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.900
- Aren't you even curious what happened to these people?
-Yes, I'm curious, Mulder, but I'm also suspicious.

13:19.900 --> 13:24.800
I mean, I... I think that Mr. Dales' story
is fueled by more than his imagination and...

13:24.800 --> 13:27.000
...not much deeper than
the bottom of a highball.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.100
Don't dismiss him so easily. He discovered the X-Files
40 years ago. He's seen things that I've only read about.

13:33.100 --> 13:36.900
Because sea monsters can only be
read about, Mulder, because they don't exist.

13:36.900 --> 13:41.500
If the sea is where life began, where
our ancestors first walked ashore, ...

13:41.500 --> 13:47.700
...then who's to say what new life may
be developing in its uncharted depths.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.200
You know what? Maybe you are
a member of the Manson family.

13:51.200 --> 13:57.100
Mulder, look, there is nothing more for us to do here.
There's nothing that the local law enforcement can't do for us.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.000
I mean, these people are missing.
There's nowhere else to look.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.800
I've done my duty for-for Mr. Dales,
for my conscience... I mean, haven't you?

14:06.800 --> 14:12.900
Well, we should at least tell him that
we're giving up... shouldn't we?

14:21.900 --> 14:25.600
Sea monsters... FBI agents...

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
I'm the one who could use a drink.

15:36.400 --> 15:41.700
How do you do, folks? You're going to have to turn
around and find yourself someplace dry to spend the night.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.800
- What's the problem, officer?
- The road's washed out up ahead.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.700
This is an emergency!

15:46.700 --> 15:50.900
I understand, ma'am, but unless your car
has wings there's no getting through on this road.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.600
Well, what about the airport?
Is there an alternate route?

15:53.600 --> 15:56.100
Airport? Not tonight.

15:56.100 --> 16:01.300
This hurricane's really bearing down on us.
We got trees, power lines down all over the place.

16:01.300 --> 16:05.500
You folks really shouldn't be out here. I want you to
drive to the first safe place you can find. You understand?

16:05.500 --> 16:12.400
Sir, it's important that we evacuate the area.
We're FBI agents and we need to get to where we're going.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.000
Don't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.400
- I'd be happy to show you my I.D...
- Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate the concern.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.900
- Mulder.
- I was just one howdy do over the line.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.500
THE BREAKERS CONDOMINIUMS
10:42 PM

16:40.300 --> 16:43.900
Car 54, please report back to base.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.500
Yeah, this is car 54.
I'm over at Nance Road, over.

16:47.500 --> 16:51.800
We're asking all mobile units to stay off
the roads due to extreme weather conditions...

16:51.800 --> 16:54.100
...forecast for the next three to four hours...

16:54.100 --> 16:59.200
...including a flash flood warning
now in effect for Collier County. Over.

16:59.900 --> 17:04.200
10-4. I'm going to make a quick
stop in at the Breakers condo complex.

17:04.200 --> 17:08.200
Looks like some folks are
stranded without power, over.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.500
It's Deputy Greer, County Sheriff.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.800
If you're home, please answer the door.

17:41.300 --> 17:47.300
If you can hear me, but you can't answer
the door, call 911, tell them you need help.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.000
Hello?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.100
It's Deputy Greer, County Sheriff.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.600
If you're home, answer the door.

17:58.200 --> 18:03.400
If you can hear me, but can't answer
the door, call 911, tell them you need help.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.100
Hello?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.700
Hello? Somebody here?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
Sir?

18:23.400 --> 18:25.400
Ma'am?

19:30.900 --> 19:35.100
- Hello?
- The good thing about zero visibility, Scully?

19:35.100 --> 19:39.600
- Can't get any worse.
- Is this the Collier County Sheriff?

19:39.600 --> 19:43.900
Yes.
Oh, hi. We're driving on, uh...

19:43.900 --> 19:47.200
Nance Road... N-A-N-C-E Road.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.900
Nance Road.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.700
No, it isn't very smart, is it?

19:55.200 --> 19:59.300
No... Yes, that would be much appreciated.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.900
He's going to guide us
to the nearest emergency shelter.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.500
Not a moment too soon.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.700
Hello?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.400
Hello...

20:11.900 --> 20:13.900
No service.

20:15.700 --> 20:19.100
You know, Scully, someday...

20:19.100 --> 20:21.800
...we're gonna look back on
this and we're gonna laugh.

20:21.800 --> 20:28.100
We'll just think of it as, uh... you know
man pitted against the forces of nature.
Think of it as a test of our mettle.

20:28.100 --> 20:31.000
I don't need my mettle tested.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.600
- What was that?
- I think that was a-a tree branch. Debris is starting to fly.

20:37.600 --> 20:41.500
Mulder, we have to pull over. We have to wait
out this storm somewhere away from the trees.

20:41.500 --> 20:45.900
We're not going to dodge any trees in a parked car.
At least if we're driving, we're a moving target.

20:45.900 --> 20:50.200
We don't know where we are and
we don't know where we're going.

20:50.500 --> 20:54.500
There's somebody, I think, who's
about to give us directions.

20:55.100 --> 20:58.300
Who says there's never
a cop when you need one?

21:22.300 --> 21:25.700
- Mulder, isn't that...
- Forrest Gump.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.700
Deputy?

21:31.300 --> 21:33.000
Hello?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.200
Anybody...

21:36.200 --> 21:38.200
Mulder, he's in here.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.700
Can you talk to me?

21:48.700 --> 21:51.700
You're having trouble breathing?

21:57.100 --> 22:01.000
This man needs a trach or
he's going to die real soon.

22:20.200 --> 22:24.200
I've heard of passing the time... Ouch.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.000
Mulder, I need you to hold his head real steady.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.700
Deputy, just try and relax.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.000
Okay. Here we go.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.800
Looks like he was attacked or stung.
What are those?

23:01.800 --> 23:06.600
I don't know but he's having a reaction
which is affecting his autonomic response.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.500
Whatever it was, I think it came
through the plumbing, through the toilet.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.300
All I know is we have to get a medivac
unit out here as soon as possible.

23:13.300 --> 23:17.800
If it's in the plumbing I got to make
sure nobody else is in this building.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.900
This is Special Agent Dana Scully
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.800
I need a medivac unit out here ASAP.

23:33.200 --> 23:37.500
I have an officer in need
of emergency medical assistance.

23:37.500 --> 23:42.000
- Please state your name again, ma'am.
- My name is Dana... Scully.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.200
- Scully! Oh, God.
- I'm a medical doctor requesting a medivac unit
for a sheriff's deputy who is injured.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.600
You have a deputy down?

23:50.600 --> 23:55.400
I have a deputy who's been attacked
by something as yet unidentified.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.700
- Unidentified? My ass!
- What's his condition, ma'am?

23:58.700 --> 24:04.200
His vitals are weak and he's in shock.
Now, I need him taken to a hospital right away.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.800
Excuse me, sir. Is everything
okay in your apartment?

24:12.800 --> 24:19.900
- Uh, yeah, yeah. It's all good.
- Do you need some help... with your television?

24:19.900 --> 24:25.000
I thought I heard voices. Thank God! We didn't
think anybody was coming. Are you the doctors?

24:25.000 --> 24:29.400
- No. Do you need medical help?
- Yeah. We called 911, but no one came...

24:29.400 --> 24:33.500
...and everyone else is already evacuated.
We don't have a car and then the phone died.

24:33.500 --> 24:39.100
- Who's we? Who are you talking about?
- My wife and I. She's pregnant, a week past her due date.

24:39.100 --> 24:43.100
- God, I hope one of you has a car.
- You don't know this man, mister...?

24:43.100 --> 24:46.800
Uh, Suarez. Walter Suarez.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.300
Uh, no. He's not with you?

24:51.300 --> 24:55.500
- I'll put it back.
- Yeah. Everything in your pockets, too.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.700
She's right over here.
Right this way.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.400
- Angela this is, uh, Mister...
- Mulder.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.100
Stay there, Mrs. Suarez. We're going to make
sure your baby makes it safely into the world.

25:07.100 --> 25:11.200
Well, thank you, but I'm not in labor.
And my name is not "Suarez".

25:11.200 --> 25:16.700
It's Villareal. He tells people
I'm his wife. Like he's so macho.

25:16.700 --> 25:21.200
Walter, Angela... I'm going to have to ask you to
leave your apartment and come downstairs with me.

25:21.200 --> 25:27.000
Why? You got a car? Oh, Walter, here,
doesn't have a car. Not to mention a job.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.200
Right now, I just want to get you
someplace where I know you'll be safe.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.300
From what?

25:31.300 --> 25:34.600
I don't know but whatever it is it may
have seriously injured a sheriff's deputy.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.000
- Who? Where?
- In the manager's apartment.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.500
- It could be in the complex's plumbing right now.
- In the plumbing?

25:40.500 --> 25:45.500
That's great. I have to go to the
bathroom about every ten seconds.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.700
Kid's going to be a fighter. Anybody
else in the complex that you know of?

25:51.700 --> 25:54.700
- No, no one... Oh, there's George.
- George?

25:54.700 --> 25:57.500
Yeah, George Vincent.
He lives on the first floor.

25:57.500 --> 26:02.300
I went and asked him for help but he just
yelled "go away". He never listens to no one.

26:02.300 --> 26:05.200
- He's going to want to listen to me.
- Walter!

26:05.200 --> 26:07.600
- Better go.
- It's for you.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.400
Mr. Vincent!
George Vincent!

26:13.100 --> 26:16.100
Quit banging on the damn door!

26:16.400 --> 26:19.900
I'm a federal agent, Mr. Vincent.
I'm asking you to open the door.

26:19.900 --> 26:22.900
You ask away.
Then go away.

26:23.900 --> 26:28.800
Mr. Vincent, your life may be in danger
if you refuse to leave your apartment.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.600
You may be in danger if you
refuse to quit harassing me.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.800
Now, I'm armed in here
and I'm within my rights.

26:34.800 --> 26:39.400
Well, that's great. But you may not be
armed for what it is I'm talking about.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.900
What the hell are you talking about? Hmm?

26:41.900 --> 26:46.500
It don't matter. I'm armed against it.
The Junta, Cuba and Castro.

26:46.500 --> 26:50.100
I'm not going to cede my home
to no revolutionaries without a fight.

26:50.100 --> 26:55.100
You got anything else you want
to throw at me-- you bring it on.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.200
All the nuts roll down to Florida.

27:04.300 --> 27:08.700
He's had some kind of foreign organism
released into his body. His condition's worsening.

27:08.700 --> 27:12.100
I can see that. What the
hell was chewing on his neck?

27:12.100 --> 27:16.400
I don't know. It may have been
some kind of a water-borne parasite.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.100
Uh huh. You see that? You see what
happens when you live in a dump?

27:19.100 --> 27:21.800
Where's Harry?

27:21.800 --> 27:25.600
- I'm sorry. I don't know who Harry is.
- The slumlord who owns this place.

27:25.600 --> 27:30.000
- He may have evacuated.
- Harry? Right. And I'm giving birth to the Christ child.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.900
Harry's legs hardly work.
He's got to use those crutches.

27:32.900 --> 27:37.900
He don't have no car. Nobody likes him
'cause he never lifts a finger on this rat trap.

27:41.200 --> 27:45.200
- Scully, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.900
- Now, who are you?
- Nobody.

27:50.900 --> 27:55.900
Nobody? Oh, well, it is so nice to be
surrounded by so many great men.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.600
- We got to get out of here as soon as possible.
- We can't.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.500
We can put the deputy in his
car and take him to the hospital.

28:02.500 --> 28:06.500
Mulder, I just got off the radio. They won't
even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time.

28:06.500 --> 28:10.400
The roads are impassable, and I don't even know
if the deputy is movable in this condition.

28:10.400 --> 28:15.800
- You mean we're stuck here?
- It looks that way. At least until the weather breaks.

28:23.100 --> 28:27.300
Federal agents; jack-booted fascists bent
on trampling the rights of the common man.

28:27.300 --> 28:31.800
Don't need their damn
help defending my home.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.500
Violence in the pursuit
of freedom is no vice.

28:35.500 --> 28:40.000
Because all that's needed for tyranny
to prevail is for good men to do nothing.

28:51.900 --> 28:55.400
I don't think these wounds are bites or stings.

28:55.400 --> 28:59.500
There's something in here,
Mulder, right under the skin.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.000
Tongs.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.200
Mulder, what's his temperature?

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
Well, either he's got no temperature
or he's about to spontaneously combust.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.100
You're not far off. It's 106.

29:20.100 --> 29:25.500
Okay, somebody fill the tub with cold water
and find as much ice as they can in the freezer.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.200
B-but that thing is in the... plumbing.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.300
Yeah, well, it may be but unless we get his
temperature down he's not going to survive this.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.900
Now get moving.

29:48.800 --> 29:54.400
I need a container. Mulder, lift him up.
We have to get him into the tub.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.100
Mr. Vincent?

30:58.900 --> 31:00.900
Drop your weapon!

31:00.900 --> 31:02.400
Put it down!

31:02.400 --> 31:07.800
It's gonna take a whole lot more than
this to kill whatever it is I just saw.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.900
I don't know what the hell it
was but it came down out of there.

31:11.900 --> 31:13.300
You didn't see it?

31:13.300 --> 31:17.800
I caught it out of the corner of
my eye but it swooped down at me. I...

31:17.800 --> 31:21.900
- All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst.
- No, no, this thing came at me.

31:21.900 --> 31:27.700
That looks like the four-inch tie-in to the second floor.
Whatever it is didn't just rip through the ceiling.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.700
- Looks like it ripped right through the pipe.
- Where did it go?

31:30.700 --> 31:34.500
I don't know. It must still be in the building.
It's probably in the outflow system.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.500
Well, maybe it'll just flow back out.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.900
Or maybe it'll come up through
the can and grab you by the nugs.

31:38.900 --> 31:43.500
- Someone's already got him by the nugs.
- Look, you guys, whatever this thing is...

31:43.500 --> 31:46.200
...there's no evidence yet that
it's going to kill anybody.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.700
- Well, what about the man in the bathtub?
- The man in the bathtub may very well be saved...

31:49.700 --> 31:54.700
...if he can just last out this storm. In fact,
we may all be safe if we just remain calm.

31:54.700 --> 32:01.000
"Remain calm?" I got to pee so bad
my back teeth are swimming.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.800
Victory.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.700
How is he?

32:33.700 --> 32:35.900
H-he's good.

32:36.700 --> 32:41.100
- Supertanker coming through.
- Here, Angela, you can't go in there.

32:41.100 --> 32:46.800
My bladder is pressing against your unborn
child, Walter. He's going to have a head like a tortilla.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.600
This thing is in the plumbing!

32:48.600 --> 32:52.800
The volume alone could push
it right back out to sea.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.000
Scully, that's how this thing is here.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.200
The hurricane is sitting offshore dredging up
God knows what and this thing must...

32:59.200 --> 33:04.600
...have been driven into the city's reclamation
system through some offshore outfall pipe.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.700
From there it gained access to
the sewer pipes in this building.

33:07.700 --> 33:11.300
- We'll be waiting for you out here.
- Thank you.

33:12.600 --> 33:16.300
Mulder, nothing I've seen
convinces me there's a monster...

33:26.500 --> 33:31.400
I know you probably can't hear
me but no listening anyway, okay?

33:36.900 --> 33:41.200
Scully, something welled up out of
the uncharted depths of the ocean, ...

33:41.200 --> 33:44.100
...something that had been lying
there undiscovered for ages, probably.

33:44.100 --> 33:47.100
Mulder, there is no evidence
of any creature here.

33:47.100 --> 33:50.700
Those organisms might just simply
be waterborne parasites, ...

33:50.700 --> 33:54.700
...but something from
Jules Verne they are not.

33:57.900 --> 34:04.000
I saw it! I saw it! It's in the tub with the deputy.
It has giant arms like an octopus.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.400
Mulder?

34:48.100 --> 34:50.699
What the hell is it?

34:51.400 --> 34:53.100
He's gone.

34:53.100 --> 34:58.900
- It's gone?
- No. He's gone. The deputy.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.300
Where'd he go?

35:00.300 --> 35:04.800
I think the deputy went
out with the bathwater.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.100
- And he was... he was in there with it?
- No, I don't think he was.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.000
Well, she said she saw it.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.200
I'm sure she did. Look, Scully, I think I know
why nobody's ever seen this thing before.

35:14.200 --> 35:18.500
It, it just doesn't live in water. It is water,
taking shape only when it attacks, ...

35:18.500 --> 35:22.100
...like it did when the hurricane
backed seawater into the plumbing.

35:22.100 --> 35:25.400
Virtually unseeable until then.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.600
Mulder, if that were true then
this wouldn't be visible, would it?

35:28.600 --> 35:32.800
I mean, what this is showing us is
that water actually attempts to kill it.

35:32.800 --> 35:38.200
Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process. Maybe it
needs time to complete its cycle like it had with the Shipleys.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.400
- Mulder, the Shipleys weren't even in their house.
- No, they were when they were attacked...

35:41.400 --> 35:44.000
...just like the deputy was here.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.200
Using their bodies to lay its own spawn, using the body's
water content to reproduce itself, to make itself anew.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.900
- You mean, he turned into one of those things?
- There are more of them?

35:52.900 --> 35:56.800
- We got to get out of here.
- We're in the middle of a hurricane.
- We got to get to another building.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.400
Mulder, we can't. There's no
way we can transport everybody.

35:59.400 --> 36:04.700
We can use the deputy's Prowler.
How many people? We got two, four...

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Son of a bitch.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.800
The looter?

36:33.200 --> 36:35.000
Mulder?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.600
Yeah?

36:36.600 --> 36:41.300
Mulder, if we're going to
leave we should leave now.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Mulder?!

37:06.600 --> 37:09.600
Hey, Mulder, are you okay?

37:22.200 --> 37:25.200
Hey... wait a second.
What are you doing?!

37:25.200 --> 37:28.100
- I am saving our lives.
- That's my partner out there!

37:28.100 --> 37:31.100
- If he's your partner he should have listened to you.
- You can't just leave him there!

37:31.100 --> 37:33.300
- I'm not letting him in.
- He's gonna die!

37:33.300 --> 37:36.200
- What are you going to do for him?
- Well, I can at least keep him breathing!

37:36.200 --> 37:38.200
You couldn't save the deputy.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.800
Look, at least let me try.
I'm a medical doctor.

37:40.800 --> 37:45.500
That's good... because my water just broke.

38:04.700 --> 38:09.500
- You're going to be okay.
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.800
Isn't much of a choice, really, is it?

38:17.400 --> 38:20.200
We're gonna need water.

38:20.500 --> 38:24.500
If I'm gonna deliver this
baby you can put that gun down.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.800
- How do we know you're really a doctor?
- You don't.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.500
The truth is I've never
delivered a baby before.

38:32.500 --> 38:37.500
So stand back or make yourself
useful but stay out of my way.

38:56.100 --> 39:00.100
- Long, even breath!
- You got it. Breathe... Breathe.

39:00.100 --> 39:04.800
Okay, Angela, I'm going to need you to push, okay?
I need you to help me help you.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.200
Okay. So let's push.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.300
You got it. You got it.
You're on the right track.

39:14.300 --> 39:17.700
I'm going to need some towels, please.

39:21.100 --> 39:24.400
I need some towels, damn it!

39:31.300 --> 39:34.300
You're doing good.
You're doing good. Okay.

39:34.300 --> 39:38.300
You're doing good. Okay.
Let's go. Okay, push.

40:15.600 --> 40:19.400
- I can feel it up there!
- She can feel it up there!

40:19.400 --> 40:21.800
Okay, come on.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.900
Puuush! Good!

40:24.900 --> 40:28.000
You got it. Okay.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.600
- Here it comes.
- Here it comes.

40:31.600 --> 40:36.000
Here it comes.
It's coming. Okay.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.300
Hey, lady, what are you doing?

40:44.500 --> 40:47.000
- It's the water.
- What? What?

40:47.000 --> 40:50.500
- It's the water!
- I'm having it!

40:52.100 --> 40:54.700
- I'm having it! I'm having it!
- Okay!

40:54.700 --> 40:56.400
- I'm having it!
- Push!

40:56.400 --> 40:58.200
I'm having it!

41:02.100 --> 41:05.100
It's coming!
Push! Push!

41:05.100 --> 41:08.100
- Okay!
- Help!

41:08.600 --> 41:12.300
- Okay, now pick up the gun.
- Help! Aah!

41:12.700 --> 41:15.100
Pick up the gun!

41:17.900 --> 41:22.200
Shoot out the sprinklers!
Just point and shoot! Shoot out the sprinklers!

41:35.500 --> 41:38.600
My name is Dana Scully...

41:39.500 --> 41:43.400
Yeah... thank you.

41:50.300 --> 41:54.700
Yes, yes. Eww, God.
That's terrible.

41:55.400 --> 41:58.700
Well, it's official. Ten pounds,
ten ounces of piss and vinegar.

41:58.700 --> 42:05.600
El niño grande, Leroy Walter Villareal Suarez, Jr.

42:05.900 --> 42:07.600
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

42:07.600 --> 42:12.300
- Oh, it's amazing. It's truly amazing.
- What's that?

42:12.300 --> 42:17.800
That you could come here in the face of
a hurricane chasing a sea monster, yet, ...

42:17.800 --> 42:22.600
...and end up bringing
a new... life into the world.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.900
And then slaying the monster...

42:24.900 --> 42:30.400
...and save this one's life as he was
quite literally circling down the drain.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.300
She didn't save my life, really...

42:32.300 --> 42:35.800
Oh, yes, she did. Oh yes, yes,
with a gun to her head, no less.

42:35.800 --> 42:39.000
Well, you wouldn't have known to
go out in the rain if I hadn't...

42:39.000 --> 42:42.200
...pointed it out that to you that it was the
fresh water that killed the organism...

42:42.200 --> 42:46.300
- No. No no no no... I-I saw the Shipley's cat.
- Uh, well, I-I can't swallow that...

42:46.300 --> 42:50.900
No, no, no. I saw the cat, which had been
saved which had been in the washing machine.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.100
And the Shipleys had boarded up their house...

42:53.100 --> 42:56.300
...which means that the only way that they
could have vanished was if the creature...

42:56.300 --> 43:00.300
...came up through the plumbing in
a backwash of seawater... seawater.

43:00.300 --> 43:03.900
And then the deputy who vanished
from a bathtub full of Epsom salts.

43:03.900 --> 43:09.700
If Agent Scully had not been there with you I
shudder to think what would have happened to you.

43:09.700 --> 43:13.500
I'd say you owe her your life.

43:13.800 --> 43:18.500
It takes a big man to admit this, but...

43:18.800 --> 43:25.200
If I had had someone as savvy
as her by my side...

43:25.200 --> 43:32.000
...all those years ago in the
X-Files... I might not have retired.

43:33.500 --> 43:37.700
I suggest that we have a
toast to your good fortune.

43:37.700 --> 43:40.000
And I insist that we have it.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.300
So... what'll it be?

43:43.300 --> 43:45.700
A little of the...

43:45.700 --> 43:48.200
Oh, uh...

43:49.300 --> 43:52.400
- Anyone for water?
- No!
