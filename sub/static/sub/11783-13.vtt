KIDNAPPING, AND BURGLARY

39:46.509 --> 39:49.470
FOR OUR FRIEND KUSEN,

39:49.512 --> 39:53.558
GARDEN-VARIETY FRAUD FOR

39:49.512 --> 39:53.558
OUR PSYCHIC FRIEND, DALTON RAND.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.727
ANY WAY WE CAN GET THEM

39:53.599 --> 39:55.727
IN THE SAME PRISON?

39:55.768 --> 39:57.603
THAT COULD BE ARRANGED.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.604
HEY, LET'S GO, MAN.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.481
LET'S GO.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.483
SO, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT

40:02.525 --> 40:04.777
HE COULD TALK TO THEIR LOVED

40:02.525 --> 40:04.777
ONES ON THE OTHER SIDE --

40:04.819 --> 40:07.697
WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM FALLING

40:04.819 --> 40:07.697
FOR THE NEXT DALTON RAND?

40:07.739 --> 40:08.740
NOT A THING.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.452
THEN WHY DO IT?

40:16.581 --> 40:18.457
IT'S OKAY, JODIE.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.627
I'M SORRY.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.627
I'M JUST SO EMBARRASSED.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.755
NO, NO. DON'T BE.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.755
DALTON RAND IS A CON ARTIST.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.632
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HUNDREDS

40:23.796 --> 40:26.632
OF PEOPLE, MAYBE THOUSANDS.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.593
BUT NOW

40:26.674 --> 40:28.593
THAT HE'S HEADING TO JAIL,

40:28.634 --> 40:29.802
HE CAN'T DO IT TO ANYONE ELSE.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.639
THERE WAS A PART OF ME

40:31.637 --> 40:33.639
THAT KNEW IT WASN'T REAL,

40:33.681 --> 40:34.640
BUT I DIDN'T CARE.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.435
I JUST MISSED MIKE SO MUCH.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.812
I WANTED TO SEE HIM AGAIN

40:37.476 --> 40:39.812
SO BAD.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.731
YOU  WILL  SEE HIM AGAIN.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.736
MAYBE IT'LL BE A LOOK.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.821
MAYBE IT'LL BE A GESTURE.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.490
MAYBE IT'LL BE THE WAY

40:51.532 --> 40:54.535
HE SPREADS PEANUT BUTTER

40:51.532 --> 40:54.535
ON A SLICE OF BREAD.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.662
BUT WHEN YOU SEE IT,

40:54.577 --> 40:56.662
YOU'LL KNOW,

40:56.704 --> 41:00.833
AND YOU'LL SAY, "THAT'S MIKE."

41:01.876 --> 41:03.086
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:03.128 --> 41:06.505
THAT'S A MIRACLE

41:03.128 --> 41:06.505
THAT NO ONE COULD EVER SELL YOU.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.596
THANK YOU, MR. FORD.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.815
AND NOW I SEE WHY YOU DO IT.

41:28.861 --> 41:29.946
BEFORE YOU GO,

41:29.988 --> 41:32.573
THIS IS FOR YOUR SISTER

41:29.988 --> 41:32.573
AND THE BABY.

41:38.621 --> 41:39.789
WHAT IS THIS?

41:39.831 --> 41:42.583
IT'S THE MONEY RAND TOOK

41:39.831 --> 41:42.583
FROM YOUR SISTER --

41:42.625 --> 41:43.626
ALL OF IT.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.837
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.569
WAIT A SECOND.

42:10.611 --> 42:11.737
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

42:10.611 --> 42:11.737
ALL OF RAND'S MONEY

42:11.779 --> 42:12.864
WENT INTO PAYING FOR HIS SHOW.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.573
I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WAS BROKE.

42:14.615 --> 42:15.908
IT DID. HE WAS.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.577
WHERE'D THE MONEY COME FROM?

42:18.619 --> 42:20.621
DID YOU GUYS FIND

42:18.619 --> 42:20.621
THE STOLEN MONEY?

42:20.663 --> 42:22.581
HMM? DID YOU FIND KUSEN'S LOOT?

42:23.582 --> 42:24.792
WITHOUT...

42:24.834 --> 42:26.711
UNBELIEVABLE. HMM?

[ SIGHS ]

42:29.755 --> 42:32.842
HE WHO LOOKS FOR HIDDEN MONEY

42:29.755 --> 42:32.842
SHALL FIND IT...

42:32.884 --> 42:35.636
IF HE IS ALSO A THIEF.
