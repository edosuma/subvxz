02:49.031 --> 02:51.325
Okay, okay, I get the point.

02:52.368 --> 02:53.932
Of course you get the point.

02:54.245 --> 02:57.373
Look. You got five hours.
Five hours. . .

02:58.103 --> 03:00.501
. . .till the big race.

03:00.918 --> 03:03.942
Get up. Get up.
Come on, sleepy. Get up.

03:04.464 --> 03:08.739
I can't believe you're still asleep.
I'm more excited than you.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.346
Okay, look.

03:11.763 --> 03:14.370
What will the other drivers'
wives wear?

03:14.787 --> 03:17.915
''Wives''? Did I hear ''wives''?

03:18.124 --> 03:21.252
I said wives. I got ahead of myself.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.006
You said wives.

03:25.214 --> 03:28.134
-It was a slip of the tongue.
-I lI ke that slip.

03:28.551 --> 03:30.532
I lI ke that tongue too.

03:31.366 --> 03:34.182
Alex, aren't you a little bit nervous?

03:35.120 --> 03:36.893
No. I've seen it in advance.

03:37.310 --> 03:38.457
Checkered flag.

03:39.187 --> 03:40.855
Honeymoon in the Bahamas.

03:41.794 --> 03:45.548
Listen, let's just take
one ''zoom'' at a time.

03:45.861 --> 03:48.155
I'll win that race, honey.

03:48.572 --> 03:50.553
No one can stop me.

04:33.410 --> 04:35.912
Gentlemen, don't touch a thing.
It's hot.

04:36.538 --> 04:37.894
You're hot!

04:39.770 --> 04:42.065
-Rock 'n' roll driving.
-It feels good.

04:42.273 --> 04:47.591
If you'd hit the brakes sooner,
that wouldn't have happened.

04:48.217 --> 04:50.719
You drive your typewriter,
I'll drive my car.

04:51.032 --> 04:54.265
Alex, it's a computer.
You are such an asshole. Computer!

04:54.473 --> 04:55.620
Sorry.

04:56.976 --> 04:58.540
I'll be all right.

04:59.687 --> 05:01.668
God, I hope so, Alex.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.379
Just do one thing.

05:07.195 --> 05:08.550
Nibble my ear.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.636
For luck.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.807
Alex, this is a public place.

05:15.537 --> 05:18.665
-I won't race unless you do it.
-You are nuts!

05:18.873 --> 05:20.438
You're serious?

05:24.713 --> 05:26.173
I love you.

05:36.183 --> 05:38.268
-Are you happy?
-Delirious.

06:04.129 --> 06:05.067
Come here, pal.

06:11.323 --> 06:14.973
-I want you to meet some guys.
-I thought we had a deal.

06:15.182 --> 06:17.163
You drive and I jive.

06:17.476 --> 06:21.125
Any future planning must
include a little ass-kissing.

06:21.334 --> 06:23.524
So pucker up, buttercup.

06:23.941 --> 06:27.382
Did I oversell this kid, gentlemen?
I think not.

06:28.007 --> 06:31.240
Not just the hottest
rookie on the circuit. . .

06:31.448 --> 06:34.472
. . .he's photogenic, telegenic,
drug-free. . .

06:34.681 --> 06:36.349
. . .and he's good to his mom.

06:36.975 --> 06:40.416
Is that a face that'll sell motor oil,
or what?

06:40.625 --> 06:44.378
Speaks English too. Say a few words
to the nice people.

06:44.796 --> 06:47.715
Hello, son.
Champion Spark Plugs.

06:47.924 --> 06:50.322
Nice to meet you, Mr. Plugs.

06:50.531 --> 06:51.678
Will you excuse us?

06:53.763 --> 06:55.744
Jimmy Connors' attitude.

06:57.204 --> 07:01.688
All unauthorized personnel are warned
to stay clear of this area.

07:08.883 --> 07:11.073
Okay, let's do it.

07:39.018 --> 07:40.478
Back it up.

07:42.251 --> 07:43.294
More.

07:47.986 --> 07:49.133
Thanks.

07:52.470 --> 07:54.659
More. Hold it there.

07:54.868 --> 07:55.911
Go in.

07:57.579 --> 07:58.935
More.

08:12.907 --> 08:13.742
That's it.

08:28.757 --> 08:30.530
Encoder's locked.

08:37.621 --> 08:38.976
Power it up.

08:57.224 --> 08:58.371
He's good.

09:07.652 --> 09:11.823
Medical units, stand by.
30 seconds to contact.

09:12.448 --> 09:14.325
Go! Go! Go!

09:21.312 --> 09:22.354
Twenty seconds.

09:30.592 --> 09:31.635
Fifteen.

09:41.645 --> 09:42.688
Ten.

09:47.172 --> 09:48.319
Five...

09:49.987 --> 09:51.238
. . .four. . .

09:52.072 --> 09:54.992
... three... two...

09:56.035 --> 09:57.078
...one.

10:03.334 --> 10:05.524
We got him. Let's go.

10:05.837 --> 10:08.131
Take off the helmet
and open the suit!

10:16.577 --> 10:17.724
Clear!

10:22.208 --> 10:23.355
What the--?!

10:23.980 --> 10:25.232
We're moving out.

10:25.545 --> 10:27.213
What the hell's going on?!

10:27.422 --> 10:30.445
There's 7 million bucks
worth of merchandise.

10:30.654 --> 10:32.844
We won't stop till
we hit security.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.119
Clear!

10:41.290 --> 10:42.437
Oxygen!

10:52.239 --> 10:55.263
I wouldn't dance to it,
but that's a pulse.

10:58.287 --> 11:02.771
He'll survive. Good job, people.
Sedate him and wrap him up.

11:24.355 --> 11:25.711
Contact, 200 meters.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.796
This area should be clear.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.660
I guess I didn't win, huh?

11:37.390 --> 11:41.456
He still has brain function.
Clamp him. Get the lobotomizer.

11:41.873 --> 11:45.315
Imagine the shit we'd get if
we delivered him lI ke this?

11:45.523 --> 11:47.609
Forty megawatts to
the frontal lobe.

11:47.817 --> 11:51.571
-That'll burn him clean.
-Should quiet him too.

11:51.780 --> 11:53.865
What kind of hospital is this?

11:58.974 --> 12:00.122
What the hell?

12:05.752 --> 12:07.421
What kind of hospital is this?!

12:21.602 --> 12:23.792
Weapons, high left.
Take them out.

12:39.016 --> 12:39.954
In position.

12:40.267 --> 12:41.310
Hit them!

13:18.744 --> 13:20.100
Get the meat.

13:25.418 --> 13:27.086
Stunners only.

13:27.399 --> 13:29.693
I don 't want him damaged.

13:51.904 --> 13:53.676
Yo! Taxi!

14:00.454 --> 14:01.706
Warren Street.

14:03.478 --> 14:06.294
I'm driving here alone
and I'm thinking:

14:06.502 --> 14:07.753
Get fare first.

14:09.526 --> 14:11.090
Antique watch.

14:11.299 --> 14:13.280
Here. Take it.

14:13.489 --> 14:14.844
Just get out of here!

14:19.641 --> 14:21.413
This neighborhood not good.

14:21.726 --> 14:24.229
Very competitive,
and difficult to sleep.

14:24.437 --> 14:26.523
-Where are we?
-Where we are?

14:26.731 --> 14:28.504
My fare is flying.

14:32.154 --> 14:33.509
Bonejackers!

14:38.827 --> 14:39.870
I kill you!

15:09.901 --> 15:11.778
Hello! What the hell is this?!

15:11.987 --> 15:14.698
Get out of here! Vamoose! Beat it!

15:15.010 --> 15:17.826
Jose, it's Alex Furlong.
Open the door!

15:21.997 --> 15:25.438
Is Julie upstairs?
I got to see her.

15:43.686 --> 15:44.937
Come on, Julie.

15:46.918 --> 15:49.108
Julie, open up! It's me, Alex!

15:53.488 --> 15:54.530
Where's Julie?

15:54.739 --> 15:56.095
-Who?
-Julie.

15:56.616 --> 15:58.389
Julie Redlund! Who are you?

15:58.806 --> 16:02.455
I live here. Who are you?
How did you get in here?

16:02.768 --> 16:04.332
What's going on?

16:04.958 --> 16:08.086
Who are you people?
What are you doing here?

16:08.399 --> 16:11.006
-Why are you here?
-Looking for Julie.

16:11.214 --> 16:13.196
Goddamn it, where is she?!

16:13.508 --> 16:14.760
Get out of my face!

16:14.968 --> 16:18.201
Charles, wait! Julie Redlund?

16:18.409 --> 16:20.912
We bought this place
from her years ago.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.979
That's impossible.
I was with her here this morning.

16:25.604 --> 16:30.088
-Oh, my God. He's a Freejack!
-A what?

16:31.861 --> 16:35.927
We can't help you. Nobody can.
Get away, or I'll call Central.

16:36.136 --> 16:37.492
Now move!

16:38.326 --> 16:39.681
Move!

16:51.152 --> 16:54.384
There is a Freejack at large
in the area.

16:54.593 --> 16:58.346
If you see him,
report it immediately.

16:58.555 --> 17:01.579
A reward is posted for his capture.

17:01.788 --> 17:05.229
Penalties for harboring a Freejack
are extreme.

17:42.246 --> 17:44.227
I hate being the messenger.

17:44.436 --> 17:47.460
I've a feeling
the client's gonna be pissed.

17:47.773 --> 17:49.128
Oh, you do?

17:49.649 --> 17:52.465
How'd you lI ke to be
dead for a day and a half. . .

17:52.673 --> 17:55.280
. . .and someone brought
you more bad news?

17:58.617 --> 18:03.414
Patience is hard to advocate with
the delay delivering your new body.

18:03.622 --> 18:07.376
But all of my people assure me
of a rapid recapture.

18:07.689 --> 18:08.836
You failed!

18:09.253 --> 18:11.756
Sir, if I could point out. . .

18:11.964 --> 18:16.761
. . .the Spiritual Switchboard can only
hold you for another 36 hours.

18:16.969 --> 18:19.472
You should consider
an alternative body.

18:19.889 --> 18:22.600
I don't want an alternative body.

18:23.330 --> 18:25.416
I want this one.

18:55.864 --> 18:58.054
You are slipping, Victor.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.765
You're contracted to deliver Furlong.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.476
I see you, but I do not see him.

19:21.724 --> 19:23.079
Beautiful.

19:24.226 --> 19:25.686
FabergÃ©.

19:25.791 --> 19:30.379
No more excuses. Mac Corp. Security
will handle this from now on.

19:31.526 --> 19:33.194
1 91 6.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.905
Before the revolution.

19:36.218 --> 19:39.450
There was no delivery,
there will be no payment.

19:39.659 --> 19:41.640
Now, get out of my sight.

19:42.057 --> 19:46.020
Mr. Vacendak is leaving now.
He is no longer on this case.

19:48.939 --> 19:50.608
Let me tell you something.

19:50.816 --> 19:54.675
I said I'd deliver Furlong
and that's what I'll do.

19:54.883 --> 20:00.722
Make any arrangements you lI ke.
But keep your people out of my way.

20:01.661 --> 20:06.249
Why, Victor.
Who do you think you're talking to?

20:06.979 --> 20:09.586
I know who I'm talking to, Mark.

20:11.358 --> 20:12.505
An asshole.

20:14.487 --> 20:15.842
Get out!

20:35.237 --> 20:37.948
If you're a praying man, I'd start.

20:39.304 --> 20:40.451
Sister--

20:40.764 --> 20:43.371
Don't ''Sister'' me!
Get the hell up.

20:44.205 --> 20:46.499
What are you and why are you here?

20:49.210 --> 20:50.878
I don't know what I am. . .

20:51.504 --> 20:52.860
. . .or where.

20:58.803 --> 21:00.472
Maybe I died.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.268
What did they call me?

21:05.477 --> 21:06.624
Pathetic?

21:09.961 --> 21:11.629
A Freejack.

21:13.923 --> 21:15.592
Holy shit!

21:21.014 --> 21:24.768
Got him. His image is
in the Central Data Bank.

21:25.289 --> 21:29.460
If he even walks past a vid-phone,
he's ours.

21:31.963 --> 21:34.778
Retrieval costs 1 7 million.

21:36.342 --> 21:38.428
Think his body's worth it?

21:41.452 --> 21:43.746
I'd sell him yours for half that.

21:44.267 --> 21:45.935
Someone would.

21:46.770 --> 21:50.941
Few people knew the timing
of the retrieval convoy.

21:51.149 --> 21:54.277
I know anyone indulging
in commerce on the side?

21:56.154 --> 21:58.865
I don't, but it's worth checking.

21:59.074 --> 22:00.325
It sure is.

22:03.036 --> 22:04.183
Step up.

22:12.213 --> 22:13.881
Come on, Victor.

22:20.972 --> 22:25.143
1 -2-1 -3-2-7-5-1 -3-0-6.

22:25.351 --> 22:27.228
I never have nor will. . .

22:27.437 --> 22:31.086
. . .divulge information outside
of this organization.

22:31.295 --> 22:34.110
Frankly, I'm surprised you'd
even test me.

22:35.049 --> 22:38.490
I'm not testing you.
I'm testing the machine.

22:42.348 --> 22:43.599
It works.

22:48.604 --> 22:50.377
Have the others tested.

22:53.922 --> 22:56.529
Some rich son of a bitch dies. . .

22:56.738 --> 22:59.657
. . .they save his mind
in a computer. . .

22:59.866 --> 23:02.369
. . .they call
the Spiritual Switchboard.

23:02.577 --> 23:06.540
There is nothing spiritual about that.

23:06.748 --> 23:10.711
Sometimes I wonder if the good Lord
has forsaken us all. . .

23:10.919 --> 23:13.735
. . .to be letting this kind
of shit go on.

23:14.673 --> 23:17.593
Then they transfer his mind. . .

23:17.801 --> 23:19.470
. . .to your body.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.389
That's his ticket to immortality.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.413
A brain transplant?

23:27.290 --> 23:29.167
A mind transplant.

23:29.376 --> 23:34.172
Electronically, your mind will be
utterly annihilated.

23:34.589 --> 23:37.405
Sorry, she's not here.

23:37.822 --> 23:39.907
Julie Redlund.

23:42.514 --> 23:45.747
-Nothing?
-No listing.

23:46.268 --> 23:48.562
Maybe she moved out of town.

23:51.065 --> 23:53.984
She may have married, have a new name.

23:59.615 --> 24:01.701
She could be dead.

24:10.460 --> 24:12.754
Brad Carter. Try that one.

24:18.176 --> 24:19.845
He's in Sector 7.

24:20.053 --> 24:23.181
You probably knew it as Park Slope.

24:25.580 --> 24:28.499
If you think this neighborhood is
dangerous. . .

24:28.916 --> 24:31.106
. . .you have a surprise coming.

24:32.566 --> 24:37.050
Now, they're probably looking for you
by now, so you must go. Now.

24:37.780 --> 24:41.534
This place is not safe for you,
or us if you're here.

24:42.368 --> 24:45.392
Here's some food.
I keep it hidden.

24:45.913 --> 24:48.520
-Be careful out there.
-I will.

24:49.041 --> 24:50.605
Thank you, Sister.

25:02.493 --> 25:05.308
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.

25:07.811 --> 25:09.271
He does.

26:00.469 --> 26:03.285
Can you tell me
where I can find 2784?

26:06.309 --> 26:09.124
Excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for 278--

27:55.484 --> 27:57.361
Son of a bitch!

27:57.987 --> 27:59.029
I knew it!

28:02.679 --> 28:05.077
Alex Furlong!

28:05.286 --> 28:08.414
I knew it! I always knew it!
Look at you!

28:08.623 --> 28:12.377
As young and healthy
as the day you got into that car!

28:12.585 --> 28:14.462
The bastards snatched you!

28:14.879 --> 28:17.173
You got no idea the shit I got.

28:17.382 --> 28:21.344
The insurance wouldn't pay.
They couldn't find the body.

28:21.553 --> 28:25.202
-You had me insured?
-I have all my drivers insured.

28:26.037 --> 28:29.165
It did no good with you.
I looked for pieces!

28:29.373 --> 28:31.876
A nose, a finger, anything!

28:33.231 --> 28:34.900
This ain't my pad.

28:35.108 --> 28:38.967
Here you either hide what you got
or you lose it.

28:39.175 --> 28:42.825
This is remarkable.
I've never seen a Freejack.

28:43.033 --> 28:44.910
Heard about them, sure.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.934
I figured out it probably
happened to you.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.062
Seen them on the 2-D, sure.
But touch one?

28:51.271 --> 28:54.816
One I know? One that's alive?
Remarkable.

28:57.632 --> 29:00.343
How do you lI ke my antique ashtray?

29:02.428 --> 29:03.680
Porsche.

29:05.765 --> 29:08.476
'67 Porsche.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.377
You're Alex Furlong, all right.

29:15.567 --> 29:17.027
What's that about?

29:17.235 --> 29:18.904
The natives are restless.

29:21.406 --> 29:25.994
-Why do they want me?
-Because you died.

29:26.411 --> 29:27.871
Spectacularly.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.417
Incredible piece of videotape.
You should see it.

29:31.834 --> 29:37.152
They know where and when you died,
so you're a candidate for retrieval.

29:37.777 --> 29:41.844
Space-time coordinates.
It's still raw, but it'll be perfected.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.745
I don't get it. Why not grab
someone who's alive now?

29:46.953 --> 29:51.854
Look at these people. They've lived
their lives with no ozone layer.

29:52.063 --> 29:54.566
Sucking up megadoses of carbon
monoxide. . .

29:54.774 --> 29:58.111
. . .sulfur dioxide, mercury, lead,
benzene. . .

29:58.319 --> 29:59.779
. . .nuclear waste.

29:59.988 --> 30:03.533
They're hooked on drugs not around
in the 20th century.

30:03.742 --> 30:06.661
Let's face it, you're a hot property.

30:08.121 --> 30:10.624
Do you remember Julie Redlund?

30:10.832 --> 30:13.439
Sure, I remember Julie Redlund.

30:13.648 --> 30:14.795
What happened to her?

30:15.108 --> 30:19.904
She lives in Battery Park.
Safe behind the palisades of power.

30:20.113 --> 30:22.928
She's an exec at
the McCandless Corporation.

30:23.658 --> 30:27.725
Only the biggest company in the world.
They own everything.

30:28.872 --> 30:31.479
I must reach her. I must see her.

30:35.545 --> 30:37.422
That is the truth.

30:38.986 --> 30:40.759
You must reach her.

30:42.323 --> 30:44.409
They're not going for it.

30:45.243 --> 30:47.328
We should try for the mineral rights.

30:47.745 --> 30:50.561
Your try could kill the whole deal.

30:50.874 --> 30:55.566
We're talking about 3 billion.
That's worth playing cards for.

30:55.879 --> 30:58.173
Besides, I think they're
ready to fold.

30:58.381 --> 31:00.780
I want it taken off the table.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.240
Now.

31:36.233 --> 31:38.840
Why don't they return to the table?

31:44.575 --> 31:47.495
We will sign.
The mineral rights are yours.

31:48.225 --> 31:50.727
Mr. McCandless is waiting
for your call.

31:52.604 --> 31:54.481
You drive a hard bargain.

31:55.107 --> 31:57.609
Pity we don't have more lI ke you.

31:57.922 --> 32:00.946
Perhaps we would have
won the trade war.

32:17.317 --> 32:19.924
Mr. McCandless is on line 17.

32:21.801 --> 32:22.844
How'd it go?

32:23.469 --> 32:27.015
Fun. I didn't make
friends, but I made a deal.

32:27.223 --> 32:29.934
-Did we get exactly what we needed?
-And more.

32:30.143 --> 32:31.290
That's good.

32:31.603 --> 32:33.584
-Where are you?
-In Sydney.

32:33.793 --> 32:36.817
I'm near the opera
for when the fat lady sings.

32:37.025 --> 32:40.675
Something's come up.
The East-Pac deal is unglued.

32:40.883 --> 32:43.073
I need you in Tokyo tonight.

32:43.490 --> 32:46.410
-Can you handle it?
-Is this a promotion?

32:48.078 --> 32:50.581
We'll discuss it
when the deal's done.

32:50.894 --> 32:54.126
Andressen will brief
you in-flight.

32:54.335 --> 32:56.733
-When will you be back?
-Tomorrow evening.

32:57.046 --> 33:01.842
Call me if there's a problem.
Or if there's no problem. Bye.

33:05.701 --> 33:08.620
Pull your hat down.
You look too healthy.

33:08.829 --> 33:10.706
-I'm walking.
-You're standing out.

33:10.914 --> 33:14.251
The heat's on you. Slow down.
Walk with a limp.

33:15.085 --> 33:16.232
Think sick.

33:16.962 --> 33:18.214
That's better.

33:19.152 --> 33:22.280
If you look lI ke poison,
no one will touch you.

33:22.489 --> 33:25.617
You gotta look messed up.
LI ke me.

33:26.347 --> 33:28.745
There you go. One blue plate special.

33:29.684 --> 33:31.873
I waited 20 minutes for this shit?!

33:32.082 --> 33:33.750
I'll take it back!

33:34.585 --> 33:37.087
-Brad! What's up?
-What's special today?

33:37.296 --> 33:39.173
You're looking at it.

33:51.998 --> 33:54.814
-Let me speak to her.
-Let me handle this.

33:55.127 --> 33:57.004
I gotta talk to her.

33:57.316 --> 33:59.819
These things can see and hear you.

34:00.028 --> 34:02.739
Your voice over these lines,
you're done for.

34:02.947 --> 34:04.199
Now trust me.

34:04.616 --> 34:05.867
Go! !

34:36.418 --> 34:38.295
You keep looking at me. . .

34:38.505 --> 34:40.695
. . .you'll see me kill you.

34:56.023 --> 34:58.421
Why is there a piece on the table?!

34:58.630 --> 35:00.611
-Put that away.
-He started it.

35:01.445 --> 35:05.303
Hey, you moron!
You messing with my boy here?

35:05.512 --> 35:08.432
Mind your own business.
You'll live longer.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.038
A limo is coming.

35:11.247 --> 35:15.522
In 5 minutes, from the outhouse
to the penthouse.

35:15.731 --> 35:17.295
Is Julie coming?

35:17.712 --> 35:19.693
I just talked to Julie's car.

35:19.902 --> 35:21.779
Besides, keep it zipped.

35:22.092 --> 35:24.490
The frigging word is out on you.

35:25.845 --> 35:31.163
What am I swilling this puke for?
In 5 minutes, I'll be eating caviar.

35:32.832 --> 35:33.979
You?

35:34.500 --> 35:35.752
What?

35:38.046 --> 35:41.799
You said you'll be eating caviar.
Not us.

35:42.112 --> 35:46.909
Christ! You're acting lI ke
one of these paranoid creeps.

35:50.767 --> 35:52.748
You called them, you bastard!

35:53.478 --> 35:54.834
You turned me in!

35:55.042 --> 35:58.796
-I'm the one who called!
-Let go, you prick!

36:04.844 --> 36:05.991
He's my bone!

36:06.304 --> 36:08.389
-What the fuck?
-Let go!

36:34.562 --> 36:36.231
Let's get out of here!

36:41.757 --> 36:43.530
Move, move, move!

36:49.474 --> 36:51.038
Secure the door!

37:14.812 --> 37:17.002
Give us a fucking break!

37:27.117 --> 37:30.453
Come on, start, you motherfucker.

37:55.688 --> 37:57.669
Look out!

38:01.840 --> 38:04.760
-Get out of my way!
-Get out of here!

38:28.639 --> 38:31.663
Freejack approaching checkpoint
at high speed.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.213
-Victor?
-What is it?

38:40.422 --> 38:43.654
He crossed a checkpoint.
Heading toward Sector 9.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.052
I know where he's going.

39:01.277 --> 39:04.300
Don't be long, we're late.

39:04.718 --> 39:07.012
-Be back in 20 minutes.
-Okay.

39:14.624 --> 39:16.605
Door.

39:46.636 --> 39:47.887
Hi, honey.

39:58.315 --> 39:59.774
It's me, Alex.

40:02.277 --> 40:03.633
Wait a second!

40:03.841 --> 40:06.135
What's wrong?
Don't you remember me?!

40:06.344 --> 40:08.534
You're a liar! Let go of me!

40:08.742 --> 40:10.619
Who do you think I am?

40:10.828 --> 40:12.600
You're not Alex Furlong!

40:12.913 --> 40:15.311
You're the bastard who stole his body!

40:17.084 --> 40:19.795
Damn it!
Stop and listen to me!

40:22.193 --> 40:24.070
I'm Alex! I can prove it!

40:24.279 --> 40:25.635
Look at me!

40:27.094 --> 40:29.701
You gave this to me
before the race.

40:30.953 --> 40:32.725
Don't you remember?!

40:34.706 --> 40:36.375
That was yesterday.

40:37.522 --> 40:38.982
What's happened to us?

40:40.233 --> 40:43.153
Go, go! Move, move, move!

40:47.741 --> 40:51.495
-I escaped while they fought.
-Then you just found me?

40:52.016 --> 40:53.684
Brad told me where you lived.

40:58.168 --> 40:59.837
How'd you get in here?

41:00.671 --> 41:02.548
Through the open door.

41:11.724 --> 41:12.871
Panel.

41:14.956 --> 41:15.999
Security.

41:17.563 --> 41:20.587
Central Locking reports
authorized personnel.

41:20.900 --> 41:22.881
No unauthorized access.

41:23.090 --> 41:26.739
You're lying.
There's no other explanation.

41:26.948 --> 41:29.451
Your voice couldn't have
authorized access.

41:30.493 --> 41:31.536
Intruder.

41:33.726 --> 41:35.290
What'd you do that for?

41:35.498 --> 41:38.522
Whoever you are, you've got
30 seconds.

41:38.731 --> 41:40.504
Attention, tenants.

41:40.712 --> 41:43.215
You're wrong! Don't!

41:43.423 --> 41:45.300
Please remain calm.

41:45.509 --> 41:48.428
All unlocked doors will be secured...

41:48.637 --> 41:50.097
...in 15 seconds.

41:51.140 --> 41:55.936
Stay clear of the elevators.
They've been co-opted by Security.

41:56.458 --> 41:59.064
This is not a drill.

42:03.235 --> 42:07.511
Please stay where you are until
the all-clear sounds.

42:07.719 --> 42:10.847
Three seconds.
Two, one.

42:19.607 --> 42:21.171
Where's Furlong?

42:25.863 --> 42:27.636
Yo! Is this your truck?

42:27.844 --> 42:30.138
-Company's.
-Not anymore.

42:45.675 --> 42:49.950
Calling in all support vehicles.
All vehicles in on this now!

43:29.992 --> 43:33.641
Hey, Furlong. It's Vacendak.
I hate to say this...

43:33.850 --> 43:35.206
...but you're speeding.

43:35.414 --> 43:36.665
Where we going?

43:36.874 --> 43:39.376
-I hate the dark!
-Piss off!

43:40.419 --> 43:41.983
You can't get rid of me that easily.

43:50.742 --> 43:52.411
Where're you guys coming from?

44:12.953 --> 44:16.081
Mom told me never to pick up
hitchhI kers.

44:35.893 --> 44:38.396
-No applause?
-Show's not over yet.

44:40.377 --> 44:42.984
Box him in and run him down.
Be gentle.

44:43.192 --> 44:45.174
I want him without a scratch.

44:52.577 --> 44:56.748
You should stop. Imagine how upset
we'd both be if you were hurt.

44:57.061 --> 44:58.208
Oh, imagine.

45:01.649 --> 45:04.777
Come on, Vacendak.
You couldn't catch a cold.

45:04.986 --> 45:07.488
Or catch the clap in a whorehouse!

45:11.138 --> 45:12.598
Holy shit!

45:44.714 --> 45:46.278
How am I doing?

45:49.198 --> 45:50.658
Not bad.

46:02.650 --> 46:04.735
The brake pedal's on the left.

46:08.176 --> 46:09.740
Game's over, Furlong.

46:12.660 --> 46:13.703
Don 't!

46:15.788 --> 46:16.831
Don't do it!

46:30.491 --> 46:34.349
If you drink any of that, I'm out of a
job.

47:25.965 --> 47:29.614
Lord, the strange things
that wash up on this dock.

47:33.577 --> 47:35.037
I'm beat.

47:35.662 --> 47:37.122
You think so?

47:41.502 --> 47:43.796
-Pretty much.
-Then you're beat.

47:44.004 --> 47:46.194
A man thinks he's beat, he's beat.

47:48.801 --> 47:50.261
You want some of this?

47:50.469 --> 47:52.763
-What is it?
-River rat.

47:55.787 --> 47:57.351
How do you eat that?

48:04.442 --> 48:07.466
First you must cut off the head
and the tail.

48:07.987 --> 48:09.656
Then you gut it.

48:11.011 --> 48:13.305
It's all a matter of the sauce.

48:13.931 --> 48:17.476
You don't just plop down warm rodent
on a plate and say:

48:17.685 --> 48:21.126
''Here's your river rat. Would you
lI ke white or red wine?''

48:21.439 --> 48:24.254
Not that there's any wine
around here anyway.

48:24.463 --> 48:27.591
No wine since the 1 0-year depression.

48:29.572 --> 48:33.743
I can whip you up one.
This is good-eating rats.

48:45.318 --> 48:47.403
If it's come to this. . .

48:49.489 --> 48:50.636
. . .what's the point?

48:56.475 --> 48:59.708
He riddles me! The ancient riddle!

48:59.916 --> 49:01.480
What's the point?

49:03.149 --> 49:06.068
Ever seen an eagle fly
home with dinner. . .

49:06.277 --> 49:08.675
. . .for the missus and the babies?

49:09.301 --> 49:11.074
He's flying against the wind. . .

49:11.282 --> 49:15.453
. . .and he's flying in rain, and he's
flying through bullets!

49:15.662 --> 49:19.833
Then at the moment he's about to get
back to his nest. . .

49:20.041 --> 49:21.501
. . .he says:

49:21.710 --> 49:25.776
''Oh, what the fuck. It's a drag being
an eagle! ''

49:26.715 --> 49:28.175
And right then. . .

49:28.696 --> 49:30.990
. . .two little X's come across
his eyes. . .

49:31.199 --> 49:33.910
. . .lI ke in the old-fashioned
cartoons. . .

49:34.118 --> 49:36.621
. . .and he goes plunging down. . .

49:37.038 --> 49:41.209
. . .and down and down and blam!

49:43.399 --> 49:46.110
It's just a splatter of feathers.

49:47.674 --> 49:52.158
Then we don't have the national bird
of America no more.

49:53.930 --> 49:55.599
Did you ever see that?

50:01.125 --> 50:02.689
Me neither.

50:04.358 --> 50:06.965
Eagles got too much self-respect.

50:11.657 --> 50:13.430
How's yours?

50:28.549 --> 50:30.322
I'm okay.

50:31.678 --> 50:34.910
Then you too can fly. You can fly.

50:38.977 --> 50:40.541
Maybe I can.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.134
You ain't beat yet, Furlong.

50:50.656 --> 50:52.950
Not by a long shot.

50:54.097 --> 50:55.452
I know Alex.

50:55.661 --> 50:59.623
I know what he's lI ke. I know where
he goes when he's upset!

50:59.832 --> 51:02.126
You're not even sure he's Alex.

51:02.439 --> 51:07.131
Vacendak was. And if it's not
Furlong, we won't find him.

51:07.652 --> 51:10.989
-It's dangerous.
-That's why you're here.

51:13.596 --> 51:15.056
Thanks a lot.

52:12.094 --> 52:13.450
He's not here.

52:48.590 --> 52:50.780
I don't know. Maybe it wasn't him.

52:50.988 --> 52:52.552
It's me.

52:56.828 --> 52:59.330
It's all right. I'm okay.

53:05.170 --> 53:06.942
What are you doing here?

53:08.611 --> 53:09.966
Slumming?

53:13.199 --> 53:16.848
If I knew it was you,
I wouldn't have turned you away.

53:17.057 --> 53:18.308
Why not?

53:18.517 --> 53:22.688
It seems to be the way it is here.
Brad tried to cash in on me.

53:22.896 --> 53:25.607
-Why shouldn't you get in on it?
-Listen to me.

53:25.816 --> 53:27.276
Vacendak set us both up.

53:27.484 --> 53:32.177
He learned my door code, opened up my
place and led you into a trap.

53:32.490 --> 53:34.679
This guy's the best there is.

53:35.096 --> 53:36.869
You here to help me?

54:03.563 --> 54:05.440
Oh, my God!

54:09.820 --> 54:11.801
Ten million bucks?

54:12.114 --> 54:15.451
That's too much.
That's way too much.

54:16.389 --> 54:19.413
Oh, I don't know. Not really.

54:23.480 --> 54:26.399
You're definitely Alex Furlong.

54:37.557 --> 54:39.747
Something's come up. I must see you.

54:40.059 --> 54:42.353
You were clear
the last time we talked.

54:42.562 --> 54:46.524
-What else is there to say?
-It's important.

54:46.733 --> 54:50.904
Okay. I've got some business at
the Revolution. Go there.

54:51.113 --> 54:52.781
I'll see you there.

54:56.535 --> 54:59.246
-You got something going with him?
-No.

55:00.497 --> 55:03.834
-What's the hook?
-He knows about people on the run.

55:04.043 --> 55:05.711
He helps them escape.

55:40.851 --> 55:44.918
This place is on the fringe.
I keep a low profile, okay?

55:45.231 --> 55:49.298
Come on, I'll find Morgan.
I'll meet you at the bar.

56:03.583 --> 56:07.650
-Want a drink?
-Yeah. Why not?

56:29.339 --> 56:32.572
Game over.
You lose. Please try again.

56:33.719 --> 56:35.491
You got a name, sugar?

56:38.307 --> 56:39.662
It's Alex.

56:40.392 --> 56:44.042
Talk to Club Channel.
How do you lI ke it here?

56:44.459 --> 56:45.606
I don't.

56:45.814 --> 56:47.379
Everyone's chasing me.

56:47.587 --> 56:49.464
Really? What do they want?

56:50.194 --> 56:51.758
My body.

56:52.488 --> 56:54.365
The self-absorbed type.

56:54.573 --> 56:56.868
Do you know what you're into?

56:57.493 --> 56:59.996
You'll be killed for
being with him!

57:00.204 --> 57:02.081
It's Furlong, the Freejack!

57:02.290 --> 57:04.792
Break this wide and patch it in.

57:05.105 --> 57:08.546
-You left him alone?
-He's resourceful.

57:08.755 --> 57:11.466
-So what do you do, Alex?
-I race cars.

57:12.092 --> 57:15.220
I mean I used to.
I guess I'm between jobs.

57:15.428 --> 57:17.201
Get him out of here.

57:17.410 --> 57:21.059
-We got network.
-We have Freejack Alex Furlong.

57:23.562 --> 57:27.107
-Do you know how much you're worth?
- 10 million.

57:27.316 --> 57:31.904
It's gone up. 15 million to anyone
who brings you in.

57:32.529 --> 57:34.198
Bring me in?

57:34.406 --> 57:36.700
I know someone who 's trying.

57:36.909 --> 57:41.497
Goes by the name of Vacendak.
I got a message for you.

57:41.810 --> 57:44.000
Fuck you, asshole.

57:46.502 --> 57:48.483
Nobody's bringing me in.

58:07.774 --> 58:10.277
Is this a hangover
in the future?

58:10.485 --> 58:13.301
I've hidden people,
but he's too hot. . .

58:13.509 --> 58:15.282
. . .but he can't stay any place long.

58:15.595 --> 58:17.055
Can't you help?

58:17.367 --> 58:20.913
It's too big. Stop playing dumb,
you know what to do.

58:21.121 --> 58:23.832
-Go to McCandless.
-I don't want him in this.

58:24.041 --> 58:27.378
You have no choice.
He lI kes you. Go to him.

58:27.586 --> 58:30.297
Explain the situation.
Be at his mercy.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.303
Hi, how's Tokyo?

58:35.511 --> 58:39.265
Something's come up.
I'm still in New York.

58:39.474 --> 58:40.516
You're not in Tokyo?

58:41.351 --> 58:42.602
No.

58:55.010 --> 58:57.200
How long have you known Julie?

58:59.286 --> 59:02.831
Couple of years.
Haven't seen much of her lately.

59:03.457 --> 59:04.917
Why is that?

59:05.229 --> 59:08.253
She's busy wheeling and dealing.

59:09.296 --> 59:10.547
McCandless owns her.

59:12.633 --> 59:14.406
She can't be owned by anyone.

59:17.847 --> 59:20.975
Listen, things have changed.

59:21.496 --> 59:25.876
People are on the top or the bottom,
no one in between.

59:26.606 --> 59:28.483
Julie is on the top.

59:28.691 --> 59:32.966
He's a Freejack, and legally
someone else's property.

59:33.279 --> 59:36.199
-You think that's right?
-He died, Jule.

59:36.407 --> 59:38.701
Someone paid to bring him back.

59:38.910 --> 59:43.498
He belongs to them.
Should they let him be killed?

59:46.418 --> 59:47.669
Who's the client?

59:47.878 --> 59:51.006
Clients are guaranteed secrecy.

59:51.214 --> 59:55.177
The Switchboard
is a McCandless division...

59:55.385 --> 59:59.765
...even I'm not privy to its records.
Understand?

01:00:00.182 --> 01:00:03.310
I've gotta go now, I'm already late.

01:00:03.519 --> 01:00:05.604
Where are you, Jule?

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:07.690
I'm at a friend's.

01:00:09.045 --> 01:00:10.192
Is he with you?

01:00:11.652 --> 01:00:13.112
No.

01:00:15.719 --> 01:00:18.013
-I'll check into it.
-Thanks.

01:00:18.222 --> 01:00:21.871
I won 't promise anything.
Legally I can 't interfere.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.042
Why don 't you call in a few hours?
I'll see what I can do.

01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:27.502
Thanks.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:29.170
Thanks, Mac.

01:00:29.379 --> 01:00:31.256
All right, be very careful.

01:00:32.507 --> 01:00:33.758
Bye.

01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:53.675
Morgan's gone.

01:00:54.405 --> 01:00:55.865
Good.

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:22.350
Alex. . .

01:01:22.976 --> 01:01:25.061
. . .I'm a lot older now.

01:01:25.687 --> 01:01:27.147
No.

01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:33.195
You're beautiful.

01:01:57.282 --> 01:01:58.846
What's the matter?

01:02:01.036 --> 01:02:03.226
I watched you die.

01:02:43.267 --> 01:02:47.647
Furlong paid you a visit and you
gave him Brad's address.

01:02:49.941 --> 01:02:52.026
And you haven't seen him since?

01:03:04.748 --> 01:03:06.625
Are you lying, Sister?

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:14.654
The good Lord says
to turn the other cheek.

01:03:22.474 --> 01:03:26.020
He never had to deal
with dickheads lI ke you.

01:03:31.755 --> 01:03:37.073
Mac's arranged for a boat to dock
in an old recycling plant.

01:03:38.741 --> 01:03:41.765
It's abandoned.
You shouldn't need that.

01:03:41.974 --> 01:03:43.434
Hopefully.

01:03:53.131 --> 01:03:55.321
I'm not coming with you, Alex.

01:03:59.283 --> 01:04:00.639
I know.

01:04:06.895 --> 01:04:10.232
I have a life here.
I can't walk away from it.

01:04:10.649 --> 01:04:12.318
What about us?

01:04:13.673 --> 01:04:16.072
''Us'' was 1 8 years ago.

01:04:19.096 --> 01:04:21.077
It was two days for me.

01:04:21.807 --> 01:04:23.579
Two days, Julie.

01:04:31.921 --> 01:04:35.258
If I'd come to you
the day before your race. . .

01:04:35.988 --> 01:04:37.865
. . .and said, ''I have to leave.

01:04:38.073 --> 01:04:40.680
Come with me. ''
What would you've said?

01:04:47.354 --> 01:04:49.335
I would have said no.

01:05:03.621 --> 01:05:05.289
You take care.

01:05:11.233 --> 01:05:15.508
I don't know. Remember the last time
you gave me this?

01:05:23.433 --> 01:05:24.997
It's time, sir.

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:26.874
I'll be right out.

01:06:05.143 --> 01:06:07.541
Well, it looks safe.

01:06:07.854 --> 01:06:11.712
Every time I begin to feel safe,
something bad happens.

01:06:12.025 --> 01:06:13.485
You do all right.

01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:16.926
Your portrait's up in lights
all over town.

01:06:17.134 --> 01:06:20.992
People see your face,
they know you've not been caught.

01:06:21.827 --> 01:06:23.286
You're a hero.

01:06:23.495 --> 01:06:28.083
Shit, I ain't no hero.
I'm just looking after my own ass.

01:06:28.292 --> 01:06:33.088
You and I know that. But there's
8 million desperate people here.

01:06:33.297 --> 01:06:35.174
My grandmother's one of them.

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:39.136
You keep making her happy,
and I'll stick with you.

01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.013
Is that it?

01:06:41.222 --> 01:06:42.786
I guess so.

01:06:46.227 --> 01:06:48.312
Where the hell is everybody?

01:06:48.729 --> 01:06:50.606
You still feel safe?

01:07:04.058 --> 01:07:07.186
You're not getting
on that boat, Furlong.

01:07:15.841 --> 01:07:17.092
What the hell?

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.576
Get them!

01:07:21.784 --> 01:07:24.287
Come on, move it! Move, move!

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:47.957
Shit!

01:07:49.938 --> 01:07:52.858
Furlong's not there. Or in the car.

01:07:53.067 --> 01:07:55.361
Then find him and kill him.

01:07:55.569 --> 01:07:58.280
Vacendak's here
with his bonejackers.

01:07:58.593 --> 01:08:00.262
Then kill them too.

01:08:01.617 --> 01:08:03.181
Move it! Move!

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.475
Move! Move!

01:08:06.935 --> 01:08:07.978
Move!

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:18.093
Ripper, who's using hard ammo?

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:21.011
Not bonejackers.
There's someone else.

01:08:25.912 --> 01:08:29.354
-We're trapped!
-What do you mean ''we,'' white man?

01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:32.377
Just kidding. I keep me covered.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.179
There's no one below.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.705
Grab some of this hardware
and get out.

01:09:28.478 --> 01:09:31.710
They're coming,
and they don't want you alive.

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:35.151
If I run now, I'll be running forever.

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.654
I gotta find out who wants me.

01:09:38.071 --> 01:09:40.782
Go. I'll see what I can do here.

01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:50.270
I keep my grandma smiling.

01:09:51.314 --> 01:09:52.877
I will.

01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:24.265
You looking for this?

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.002
Freeze!

01:10:53.253 --> 01:10:54.400
Do it!

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:51.604
Stunners only. He wants me
without a scratch.

01:15:05.597 --> 01:15:07.266
Suck this, Vacendak!

01:16:02.218 --> 01:16:05.659
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

01:16:05.868 --> 01:16:09.622
I was aiming at you.
They were in the way.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.437
Well, they're not now.

01:16:13.271 --> 01:16:14.627
You're right.

01:16:18.068 --> 01:16:22.343
Tell me who's behind all this.
Who told you I'd be here?

01:16:24.533 --> 01:16:26.097
I'm sorry.

01:16:26.723 --> 01:16:28.704
I can't tell you that.

01:16:32.145 --> 01:16:36.107
Goddamn you, Vacendak!
All I'm asking for is a name!

01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:40.800
Now who is it?
Who's doing this to me?

01:17:02.489 --> 01:17:04.053
McCandless.

01:17:37.212 --> 01:17:39.193
I saved your life.

01:17:40.028 --> 01:17:42.739
And I gave you the name you wanted.

01:17:43.364 --> 01:17:45.554
The name of lan McCandless.

01:17:48.995 --> 01:17:53.792
Still, I'd hate you to think that
I don't value my life highly.

01:17:56.816 --> 01:17:59.423
I'll give you a five-minute start.

01:18:02.968 --> 01:18:05.053
One Mississippi. . .

01:18:05.262 --> 01:18:07.348
. . .two Mississippi. . . .

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:53.333
Get in!

01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:57.399
-You're driving?
-Hurry! They're close behind.

01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:07.410
I thought you were dead!

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.998
-Where'd you get this?
-It's Vacendak's. I stole it.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:16.064
-Sure your boss didn't give it to you?
-What?

01:19:16.273 --> 01:19:18.463
McCandless is trying to kill me!

01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:21.070
Your boss!
The man you've been calling!

01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:23.259
-That's crazy!
-Vacendak told me!

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:26.179
-Then he's lying!
-Well, somebody is!

01:19:26.909 --> 01:19:28.056
Pull in there.

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.895
Call him on this thing.

01:19:34.104 --> 01:19:37.024
I tried to get Mac, he's not there.

01:19:37.962 --> 01:19:40.048
Then you call the company.

01:19:40.256 --> 01:19:42.237
You call whoever's in charge.

01:19:56.106 --> 01:19:58.087
-Miss Redlund?
-Who's that?

01:19:58.296 --> 01:20:01.111
Mark Michelette, V.P. of Mac Corp.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.779
Is someone with you?

01:20:04.552 --> 01:20:07.785
Mr. Furlong, what an
unexpected pleasure.

01:20:08.097 --> 01:20:11.747
Listen, whoever you are.
I'm with Julie and I'm armed.

01:20:11.956 --> 01:20:16.022
I see that. Stay calm, Julie.
We'll handle this.

01:20:16.335 --> 01:20:18.003
Tell us your demands.

01:20:18.212 --> 01:20:20.193
I want to talk to McCandless.

01:20:20.506 --> 01:20:23.634
Mr. McCandless isn 't in.
He's expected shortly.

01:20:23.843 --> 01:20:27.909
If you want to wait for him here,
I'll arrange entry.

01:20:28.222 --> 01:20:29.682
You do that.

01:20:35.522 --> 01:20:36.877
What's that?

01:20:38.754 --> 01:20:40.005
I don't know.

01:20:42.821 --> 01:20:44.385
It's a trace.

01:20:44.802 --> 01:20:47.617
All right, I've got a fix on Furlong.

01:20:48.139 --> 01:20:49.390
Where's he headed?

01:20:49.703 --> 01:20:51.580
Right to the gates of hell. . .

01:20:51.893 --> 01:20:54.604
. . .at Michelette's invitation.

01:22:21.256 --> 01:22:22.716
They're in the elevator.

01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:53.164
Put down the gun.

01:22:53.372 --> 01:22:56.396
You can drop this absurd pantomime.

01:22:57.022 --> 01:23:01.506
I watched the rest of the tape.
Most interesting.

01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:22.256
Watch this bit. This is good.

01:23:37.898 --> 01:23:39.462
How touching.

01:23:40.609 --> 01:23:42.069
A woman in love.

01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:45.927
There's not the least chance
you'd shoot her.

01:23:46.135 --> 01:23:48.638
You'll be through when Mac gets back.

01:23:48.846 --> 01:23:53.539
Mr. McCandless is in the next
office. Would you lI ke to see him?

01:24:19.712 --> 01:24:24.195
A virus, strain three.
He's been dead almost three days now.

01:24:24.508 --> 01:24:27.636
Mac didn't have much time
to organize this.

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:31.078
His mistake was
asking me to carry it out.

01:24:31.286 --> 01:24:35.457
McCandless snatched you.
He needs your body quite badly.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:40.567
He has an hour on the Switchboard
before his brain is irretrievable.

01:24:40.879 --> 01:24:44.112
How do you suppose
you'll deliver me to him?

01:24:46.406 --> 01:24:49.847
I have no intention
of delivering you to him.

01:24:50.055 --> 01:24:52.975
Nobody's being delivered
to McCandless.

01:24:53.392 --> 01:24:55.999
The time has come for change.

01:24:57.146 --> 01:24:59.649
I'm taking over the company.

01:25:00.170 --> 01:25:02.464
I have nothing against you.

01:25:02.673 --> 01:25:05.488
I did organize the rocket attack.

01:25:05.697 --> 01:25:08.304
I sent guns to the waterfront. . .

01:25:08.512 --> 01:25:11.119
. . .to stop Mac
from getting his new body.

01:25:11.327 --> 01:25:12.996
Nothing personal.

01:25:13.204 --> 01:25:18.001
In a short time, McCandless' brain
will be electronic rubbish.

01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:21.755
I'll be president of the company,
and you two. . . .

01:25:24.258 --> 01:25:27.177
You two can do
whatever takes your fancy.

01:25:33.642 --> 01:25:35.311
Ms. Redlund. . .

01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:41.984
. . .your services are
no longer required.

01:26:20.357 --> 01:26:22.026
They're on their way.

01:26:25.675 --> 01:26:27.239
I kill them both.

01:26:34.226 --> 01:26:36.311
This is too easy.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.127
Think he'd just let us walk out?

01:26:42.255 --> 01:26:43.298
I don't.

01:26:43.506 --> 01:26:45.174
Ready!

01:26:46.009 --> 01:26:47.886
Is there another way out?

01:26:48.094 --> 01:26:50.492
There's a back way.

01:26:55.915 --> 01:26:57.062
One shot.

01:26:58.730 --> 01:27:01.024
Think they'll stand in line?

01:27:01.233 --> 01:27:02.380
Aim.

01:27:13.224 --> 01:27:15.206
Welcome to the lobby.

01:27:16.457 --> 01:27:18.647
Have a nice day.

01:27:18.855 --> 01:27:19.689
Hold it!

01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:21.983
Fire!

01:27:27.093 --> 01:27:28.657
Julie, you okay?

01:27:33.975 --> 01:27:36.895
-Why the 1 00th floor?
-There's an escape module.

01:27:39.084 --> 01:27:41.691
Michelette's private bodyguard.

01:27:42.734 --> 01:27:44.507
Michelette.

01:27:45.237 --> 01:27:50.137
Secure the building.
Find him and hold him for me.

01:27:52.327 --> 01:27:55.455
You wanted a fucking palace revoIt?

01:27:55.768 --> 01:27:57.437
Well, you got one!

01:27:57.854 --> 01:27:59.105
It's not stopping.

01:28:02.129 --> 01:28:03.172
It's not stopping!

01:28:04.423 --> 01:28:07.238
-Any other way to controI it?
-This is it.

01:28:11.097 --> 01:28:14.121
200. They're headed
for the Switchboard.

01:28:14.329 --> 01:28:15.685
Mac's got them now.

01:28:29.032 --> 01:28:30.492
We're going to the top.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.517
Welcome to my mind.

01:31:37.664 --> 01:31:39.854
You've been behind it all.

01:31:45.693 --> 01:31:49.135
I never meant to harm anyone,
least of all you.

01:31:51.324 --> 01:31:54.035
You weren't meant to see any of this.

01:31:54.661 --> 01:31:57.894
It's why I wanted you
to take the trip to Tokyo.

01:31:58.102 --> 01:32:02.169
By the time you returned,
all this would've been over.

01:32:02.377 --> 01:32:05.089
I spoke to you in Australia.
You were alive.

01:32:05.401 --> 01:32:06.653
I'm sorry, Jule.

01:32:06.965 --> 01:32:08.738
Sorry to deceive you.

01:32:09.781 --> 01:32:14.265
Mr. Furlong, believe me,
I never meant you any harm either.

01:32:14.473 --> 01:32:17.601
We took you out a moment
before your death.

01:32:17.914 --> 01:32:21.147
The process did not shorten
your natural life.

01:32:21.355 --> 01:32:24.588
What about trying to shorten my
unnatural life?

01:32:26.986 --> 01:32:29.072
Didn't start out that way.

01:32:29.593 --> 01:32:32.096
I was assured all would go smoothly.

01:32:32.304 --> 01:32:35.120
You were never supposed to wake up.

01:32:36.788 --> 01:32:41.585
So you see, once the consciousness
transfer was complete. . .

01:32:41.793 --> 01:32:46.694
. . .a fait accompli, only then would
I have shown you my new self.

01:32:47.111 --> 01:32:48.884
Why do it at all?

01:32:50.761 --> 01:32:52.638
Because I love you.

01:32:53.889 --> 01:32:57.226
I've loved you for years,
since we first met.

01:32:57.747 --> 01:33:02.439
But it was clear that nothing I
possessed, no power or wealth. . .

01:33:03.274 --> 01:33:06.193
. . .nothing could make you feel
what I felt.

01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:09.322
I held out hope
that with enough time. . .

01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:11.720
. . .I could reach your heart.

01:33:12.241 --> 01:33:14.848
But time ran out. I became ill.

01:33:15.578 --> 01:33:17.038
I was dying.

01:33:19.436 --> 01:33:24.650
You spoke of Mr. Furlong and
how much you loved him years ago.

01:33:25.171 --> 01:33:27.987
If only I could become this man. . .

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.385
. . .whom you loved so much. . . .

01:33:30.906 --> 01:33:32.679
If I could somehow. . .

01:33:33.096 --> 01:33:35.182
. . .physically become him. . . .

01:33:37.997 --> 01:33:39.874
Of course, I was mad.

01:33:40.083 --> 01:33:41.542
I was quite mad.

01:33:41.751 --> 01:33:44.254
I beg you both to forgive me.

01:33:45.401 --> 01:33:48.112
Vacendak, it's Mac. Listen carefully.

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.657
I'm calling it off, the whole thing.
Everything.

01:33:51.866 --> 01:33:53.221
Say that again.

01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:58.122
Cease all pursuit of Furlong.
You will be paid in full.

01:33:58.643 --> 01:34:01.250
Procedure 21 7, as discussed.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:07.924
I tried to steal love from you,
love I was unable to win.

01:34:08.132 --> 01:34:10.844
Worse, I've tried
to cheat life itself. . .

01:34:11.156 --> 01:34:13.659
. . .by seizing years not granted me.

01:34:13.867 --> 01:34:17.934
For these crimes,
I sentence myself to death.

01:34:20.228 --> 01:34:22.314
Documents have been prepared.

01:34:22.522 --> 01:34:24.086
My termination here. . .

01:34:24.295 --> 01:34:28.674
. . .will be as if the actual
consciousness transfer was made.

01:34:29.092 --> 01:34:30.551
In other words. . .

01:34:30.864 --> 01:34:33.158
. . .you will be me.

01:34:34.827 --> 01:34:35.974
Don't be alarmed.

01:34:36.599 --> 01:34:40.875
A little play-acting will be required.
Julie will help.

01:34:41.604 --> 01:34:43.273
I'd be you?

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.235
We could do it.

01:34:47.444 --> 01:34:50.885
We could pull it off.
You and me, together.

01:34:51.928 --> 01:34:54.326
Stranger things have happened.

01:34:56.307 --> 01:35:00.374
Just think of it. You'll have
all my money and power.

01:35:00.791 --> 01:35:04.023
Let's hope you use them
more wisely than I.

01:35:12.991 --> 01:35:16.328
Before you is a sequence of numbers.

01:35:16.536 --> 01:35:18.309
Let's get on with it.

01:35:19.143 --> 01:35:21.229
Start with the first number. . .

01:35:21.542 --> 01:35:24.253
. . .key in the sequence,
then hit delete.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.349
The sequence is in.

01:35:36.557 --> 01:35:39.164
Then hit delete, Mr. Furlong.

01:35:51.468 --> 01:35:52.511
Strange.

01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:54.909
I'm still here.

01:35:55.639 --> 01:35:57.203
You must have missed one.

01:35:57.933 --> 01:35:59.185
Do it again.

01:36:13.366 --> 01:36:14.930
You're stalling.

01:36:20.665 --> 01:36:24.628
What kept you? I've been humoring
him for 5 minutes.

01:36:25.045 --> 01:36:26.505
I was a bit busy.

01:36:27.026 --> 01:36:30.988
I almost had Michelette,
but he's still missing.

01:36:38.496 --> 01:36:39.539
Let him go!

01:36:39.852 --> 01:36:41.103
Sorry, Jule.

01:36:41.312 --> 01:36:43.710
-It's either him or me.
-Too bad.

01:36:44.336 --> 01:36:46.421
I was just getting used to you.

01:36:46.838 --> 01:36:49.445
You don't make many friends
in this business.

01:36:50.488 --> 01:36:52.260
Who says we're friends?

01:36:52.469 --> 01:36:53.616
Well, Vacendak?

01:36:54.867 --> 01:36:56.223
Shall we?

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.308
Shall we make the switch?

01:37:07.067 --> 01:37:09.153
Just let it happen, Mr. Furlong.

01:37:09.361 --> 01:37:10.926
Just go with it.

01:37:16.765 --> 01:37:18.955
You need a new soul, not a new body.

01:37:19.372 --> 01:37:21.353
No machine can give you that.

01:37:24.168 --> 01:37:25.420
Don't resist.

01:37:25.732 --> 01:37:26.984
The computer is powerful.

01:37:27.192 --> 01:37:29.382
You can fight it, Alex.

01:37:53.469 --> 01:37:57.432
Your mind will be utterly
annihilated.

01:37:57.953 --> 01:37:59.205
You can 't help yourself.

01:37:59.413 --> 01:38:00.977
Nobody can.

01:38:06.921 --> 01:38:09.006
You've completely lost it.

01:38:09.215 --> 01:38:10.988
He set me up!

01:38:11.196 --> 01:38:13.073
Don 't do it!

01:38:54.679 --> 01:38:57.598
Excellent shot, Mrs. Redlund.

01:38:58.015 --> 01:39:02.916
You just made me head of Mac Corp.
Remind me to change the name.

01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:05.732
Put the gun down, Vacendak.

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.694
I controI the company, the city,
the banks, everything.

01:39:09.903 --> 01:39:12.614
You're no longer needed, asshole.

01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:15.951
McCandless is no more.

01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:24.501
Wait. . .

01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:27.212
. . .I'm McCandless.

01:39:28.672 --> 01:39:31.175
Nice try, Mark, but I made it.

01:39:31.383 --> 01:39:36.388
-I completed the transfer.
-Don't you give me that shit.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.768
Shoot him, Vacendak.
He tried to assassinate me.

01:39:40.976 --> 01:39:43.479
You take orders from a Freejack?

01:39:44.522 --> 01:39:45.982
Who is he?

01:39:50.361 --> 01:39:55.158
There were 22.762 seconds of transfer
before it blew off-line.

01:39:55.471 --> 01:39:57.869
-Is he McCandless?
-Of course I am.

01:39:58.286 --> 01:40:00.789
We've completed transfers
in that time. . .

01:40:00.997 --> 01:40:02.874
. . .and we've had
them take longer.

01:40:03.083 --> 01:40:04.751
I don't know.

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.879
Mr. McCandless will have to
identify himself.

01:40:08.296 --> 01:40:11.842
We can't get a voice-print lock.
A ret scan won't work.

01:40:12.259 --> 01:40:15.700
He is lying!
Check his personal I.D. number!

01:40:16.013 --> 01:40:18.932
Only McCandless would know that!

01:40:26.649 --> 01:40:27.900
Well?

01:40:34.678 --> 01:40:37.597
What more do you want?
Shoot him, Vacendak!

01:40:47.921 --> 01:40:49.380
Six.

01:40:52.717 --> 01:40:54.073
Correct.

01:40:55.846 --> 01:40:56.888
Continue.

01:40:58.661 --> 01:41:00.121
Nine.

01:41:02.936 --> 01:41:04.500
Proceed.

01:41:05.647 --> 01:41:06.899
Two.

01:41:10.861 --> 01:41:12.008
Seven.

01:41:15.241 --> 01:41:16.388
Five, seven.

01:41:16.596 --> 01:41:20.871
Five, four, six, nine, seven!

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.748
Goddamn you, McCandless!

01:41:48.817 --> 01:41:50.381
Nice to have you back.

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:52.988
Nice to be back.

01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:59.244
Remarkable.
I feel good.

01:41:59.453 --> 01:42:01.434
Gentlemen, prepare my car.

01:42:05.084 --> 01:42:08.629
You'll be dressed in something more
appropriate, then. . .

01:42:08.838 --> 01:42:10.610
. . .you'll come with me.

01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:14.677
-I'll be driving today.
-Very well, sir.

01:43:13.696 --> 01:43:15.990
I knew you'd make a mistake.

01:43:17.346 --> 01:43:19.536
McCandless can't drive.

01:43:23.185 --> 01:43:25.792
You must coach him better than that.

01:43:31.214 --> 01:43:32.674
Is that you?

01:43:33.717 --> 01:43:35.177
Nibble my ear. . .

01:43:36.741 --> 01:43:38.097
. . .for luck.

01:43:41.225 --> 01:43:42.997
How'd you get the I.D. number right?

01:43:43.206 --> 01:43:44.562
He didn't.

01:43:45.917 --> 01:43:47.377
I lied.

01:43:47.898 --> 01:43:50.297
He wasn't even close.

01:44:04.687 --> 01:44:06.251
Are we really going to do this?

01:44:06.459 --> 01:44:09.587
Stranger things have happened.
Buckle up.

01:44:09.796 --> 01:44:11.673
Let's see what this baby can do.
