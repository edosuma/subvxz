– Oh, this is awesome!
– Oh my God!

00:29.097 --> 00:31.734
Oh my God!
This is crazy!

00:31.825 --> 00:33.658
Oh my God. So incredible.

00:34.231 --> 00:35.666
– You wanna know a secret?
– Yeah!

00:35.691 --> 00:36.891
– I took a Viagra.
– What?

00:36.924 --> 00:39.265
This is awesome.
Why don’t I use this every day?

00:39.296 --> 00:40.621
What did you do?

00:40.635 --> 00:41.562
– Wait. Stop.
– I can’t!

00:41.575 --> 00:42.534
Stop, stop!

00:42.543 --> 00:43.663
Stop!
– What?

00:43.745 --> 00:44.865
Aah!

00:47.013 --> 00:48.090
What’s the matter?

00:48.286 --> 00:49.502
What’s the matter?

00:49.773 --> 00:52.080
You just took a Viagra
to have sex with me.

00:52.145 --> 00:53.955
Well, I- I- I thought it
would make it better.

00:53.973 --> 00:55.978
It was better. It takes
some of the pressure off.

00:56.049 --> 00:58.734
Because you can’t get
hard without a Viagra?

00:58.890 --> 01:00.460
Is it because you don’t I’m think sexy?

01:00.473 --> 01:04.212
I thought you’d think it was fun
for me to supersize it for once.

01:04.269 --> 01:08.478
That is the worst birthday present
you could ever give someone.

01:08.490 --> 01:11.433
I was just trying to go
turbo for your birthday.

01:11.449 --> 01:13.493
My hard-ons are still in analog.

01:13.527 --> 01:14.689
This shit’s digital.

01:14.735 --> 01:17.023
I don’t want a turbo penis.

01:17.297 --> 01:19.708
I like your medium soft one.

01:19.898 --> 01:21.848
Look, I can get it up. Just…

01:22.208 --> 01:23.575
not that far up.

01:23.672 --> 01:25.223
Where did you get this?

01:25.286 --> 01:26.575
I got it from Barry.

01:26.615 --> 01:27.940
What?

01:28.294 --> 01:29.933
You got it from Barry?

01:29.944 --> 01:33.644
Why do you care? This is my
dick we’re talking about, not yours.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.098
We are young people.

01:35.113 --> 01:37.504
We don’t need medication to have sex.

01:37.553 --> 01:39.708
I only took it ’cause it’s your birthday.

01:39.717 --> 01:42.504
I thought you’d like it.
Happy fucking fortieth birthday.

01:42.611 --> 01:44.436
I am not forty!

01:44.764 --> 01:48.366
And I don’t wanna have a husband
who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on!

01:48.382 --> 01:50.676
I don’t have to take it every
time, but once in a while…

01:50.693 --> 01:54.854
Fuck forty!
Forty can suck my dick!

01:55.683 --> 02:00.977

03:46.219 --> 03:47.969
Can I watch Lost?

03:48.231 --> 03:49.838
You can’t handle Lost.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.502
It’s too violent, and
you won’t understand.

03:52.605 --> 03:55.556
If I don’t understand it,
why can’t I handle it?

03:55.587 --> 03:56.579
Because you’re eight.

03:56.609 --> 04:00.333
I can handle it. I’ve seen a shark
eat a guy on Shark Week.

04:00.376 --> 04:01.630
Shark Week is fake.

04:01.668 --> 04:03.114
No, it’s not.

04:03.146 --> 04:04.948
All of it is reenactments.

04:04.991 --> 04:06.522
– I know but they sh--
– And that’s scary,

04:06.545 --> 04:08.238
you shouldn’t be allowed to watch that.

04:08.242 --> 04:12.581
They show the reenactments
but they actually happened.

04:12.763 --> 04:14.349
It’s gonna give you nightmares.

04:14.404 --> 04:17.858
I can handle a nightmare.
You’re a nightmare every day for me.

04:21.033 --> 04:22.289
Hey!

04:23.409 --> 04:25.266
– Don’t eat that cupcake.
– What?

04:25.377 --> 04:27.504
The one you just put into the sink.

04:27.645 --> 04:29.406
I saw you were hiding that.

04:29.446 --> 04:31.389
This cupcake? You think
I might eat this cupcake?

04:31.403 --> 04:33.240
– Yeah.
– I so don’t want this cupcake. Look.

04:33.264 --> 04:35.170
– You’re still gonna eat it.
– I’m gonna eat this cupcake?

04:35.186 --> 04:36.394
Just put it in the trash.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.676
What would you like to do?
Your choice.

04:39.369 --> 04:41.105
– Anything?
– Yeah, anything.

04:41.285 --> 04:43.102
Just hang out with you guys.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.133
Don’t you want to get a massage? Or…

04:45.409 --> 04:48.368
do something fun, it’s a bit--
Forty’s huge!

04:48.465 --> 04:49.478
I’m turning thirty-eight.

04:49.525 --> 04:51.033
Okay. Thirty-eight.

04:51.071 --> 04:52.654
We will move on.

04:53.095 --> 04:55.147
Isn’t that weird that
our birthday is the same week

04:55.163 --> 04:57.288
and that we’re gonna have
a party, and it’s just for me?

04:57.319 --> 04:59.019
No. I don’t think it’s weird at all.

04:59.293 --> 05:01.386
’Cause you’re turning forty
and I’m turning thirty-eight.

05:01.392 --> 05:04.819
Come on. Do you really want to be one
of those ladies who’s just so insecure

05:04.821 --> 05:08.662
about their age and they lie and then
they’ve got to remember, and it gets all--

05:08.671 --> 05:12.239
You don’t get it. See, you don’t
understand how it works.

05:12.290 --> 05:14.606
I don’t want to shop at old lady stores.

05:14.700 --> 05:18.408
I don’t want to go to J. Jill and
Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft.

05:18.431 --> 05:20.002
I’m not ready yet.

05:20.163 --> 05:21.455
I need two more years.

05:21.501 --> 05:23.901
That is so insane,
it kind of makes sense.

05:25.238 --> 05:26.712
What did you get me for my birthday?

05:26.755 --> 05:29.799
Wait a minute, I thought you said that we
shouldn’t get each other gifts this year?

05:30.026 --> 05:31.349
What do you mean?

05:31.561 --> 05:33.521
You’re supposed to get me a surprise gift.

05:33.556 --> 05:35.159
This is a big birthday.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.552
I’m turning forty!

05:40.113 --> 05:41.313
Mom!!

05:42.876 --> 05:45.787
Mom, why can’t I get new clothes?!

05:45.952 --> 05:49.887
What the fuck, nothing fits me!!

05:50.559 --> 05:52.637
God damn it!!

05:53.410 --> 05:55.916
I am gonna go work out.
I’ll be back in about an hour.

05:55.947 --> 05:58.226
Hey, did your father call
to wish you a happy birthday?

05:58.261 --> 06:00.061
No. That’s no surprise.

06:18.080 --> 06:18.985
– Come on.
– Coming.

06:18.992 --> 06:20.304
You’ve gotta keep up
with us, sweetheart.

06:20.305 --> 06:21.086
Yeah, I’m coming.

06:21.133 --> 06:24.359
That’s why your body looks like your
body and her body looks like her body.

06:24.668 --> 06:26.993
Before, after. Before, after.

06:27.646 --> 06:30.646
You guys just go on, go on
without me, I’m just gonna…

06:30.831 --> 06:32.112
Look, I gotta…

06:32.449 --> 06:33.706
Fuck.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.965
Thanks for uh…

06:38.394 --> 06:40.644
Thanks for letting me join this team.

06:40.963 --> 06:43.979
It’s not really a team, it’s just a bunch
of guys who get together and ride.

06:44.004 --> 06:44.931
I know, I know.

06:44.965 --> 06:45.994
Wow wow wow wow!

06:46.830 --> 06:49.384
Hey! Bike lane, asshole!

06:49.594 --> 06:52.053
It’s always the guy
in the fucking Infiniti.

06:53.107 --> 06:55.511
Good seater. Get’em take here.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.589
– Yeah. Okay.
– This we need to work on.

06:57.658 --> 06:59.421
So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra?

06:59.431 --> 07:01.241
What’s going on?
– I don’t know.

07:01.353 --> 07:05.436
I think he just-- maybe he isn’t…
isn’t attracted to me anymore…

07:05.461 --> 07:07.529
or something.
I don’t know.

07:07.547 --> 07:08.841
Well that is ridiculous.

07:08.908 --> 07:11.250
If you were my girlfriend,
I would not need a Viagra.

07:11.344 --> 07:14.101
I would need an anti-Viagra pill.

07:14.522 --> 07:16.341
To try not to get a boner.

07:16.615 --> 07:18.362
But everyone gives you a boner.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.315
Don’t sell yourself short like that.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.925
You give me a boner.

07:22.195 --> 07:23.714
Barb doesn’t give me a boner.

07:24.638 --> 07:26.613
Maybe things are just getting stale.

07:26.848 --> 07:29.472
That’s why maybe I work out really hard.

07:29.670 --> 07:32.847
Maybe he’ll get…
he’ll be able to get a boner again.

07:33.309 --> 07:35.213
Why d'you need to have sex, Deb?

07:35.429 --> 07:37.669
Sex is the number one
thing people fight about.

07:37.910 --> 07:40.910
You stop having
sex, there will be no more fights.

07:41.113 --> 07:42.682
I am living proof.

07:42.713 --> 07:43.924
I have no sex,

07:44.125 --> 07:46.682
and I am the happiest I’ve ever been.

07:46.778 --> 07:49.580
I knew it. I knew you were not having sex.

07:49.604 --> 07:51.404
I can see it on your face.
It’s all…

07:51.940 --> 07:53.760
uh, puckered and pained.

07:55.021 --> 07:57.242
I’m enjoying our non-sex period,
that’s all I’m saying.

07:57.405 --> 07:58.293
Don’t you miss it?

07:58.340 --> 08:00.639
Well, I wouldn’t know, because I don’t
have any feeling down there anymore.

08:00.657 --> 08:03.657
I have nerve damage from my C-section,
so everything's just kinda-

08:03.913 --> 08:05.467
She’s numb down there.

08:05.577 --> 08:09.830
I could sit down hard
on a fire hydrant, and

08:09.968 --> 08:12.801
I wouldn’t even know that I was sitting.

08:13.036 --> 08:15.606
I could get stung by a hornet
down there, and I would not feel it.

08:15.622 --> 08:17.402
You could put anything…

08:18.285 --> 08:19.488
in there…

08:19.694 --> 08:22.074
and I would not know
what the object was.

08:22.317 --> 08:25.447
I- I used to pee in a nice stream,
and now it just kind of goes

08:25.502 --> 08:26.815
like a shower head.

08:26.851 --> 08:28.489
That is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.

08:28.632 --> 08:30.520
I think you need a family.

08:30.695 --> 08:32.193
Don’t you want a family?

08:32.669 --> 08:34.239
No, I think I wanna Clooney it.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.831
– Clooney it?
– Yup.

08:35.926 --> 08:37.495
He doesn’t seem happy.

08:37.765 --> 08:38.605
Yeah, he is.

08:38.754 --> 08:40.433
No. He’s lonely.

08:40.918 --> 08:41.642
No, he’s not.

08:41.751 --> 08:44.243
See, I think he has sad eyes.

08:44.299 --> 08:46.056
Aw, you sweet little thing.

08:46.148 --> 08:48.677
No. He’s doing sad, lonely eyes.

08:48.979 --> 08:51.979
To get the next lady.
Look, I can do it too. Watch.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.281
I bet George Clooney is really lonely.

08:56.544 --> 08:58.672
Just him and his… pig.

08:58.690 --> 08:59.555
You’d fuck him.

08:59.609 --> 09:00.437
I wouldn’t.

09:00.455 --> 09:02.502
– So would you.
– I would. I wouldn’t feel it but I-

09:02.508 --> 09:04.679
You’d fuck him with your numb vagina.
Yes you would.

09:05.383 --> 09:08.013
Ocean’s thirteen inches,
that’s what you’d find out.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.066
Do you think?

09:10.272 --> 09:12.922
I mean that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

09:13.042 --> 09:16.813
I mean, that’s like the one thing you
don’t do is tell her that you used Viagra.

09:16.853 --> 09:18.773
I think that’s even on the warning label.

09:19.075 --> 09:21.562
We’re in one of those phases where…

09:21.883 --> 09:26.021
everything that the other person says
just annoys the shit out of each other.

09:26.105 --> 09:28.240
All the time. It’s a blast.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.563
Don’t worry about it.
You just gotta ride that out.

09:31.126 --> 09:32.343
This sounds terrible…

09:32.390 --> 09:34.054
Okay. I like it.

09:34.132 --> 09:35.124
.. but…

09:35.679 --> 09:38.129
do you ever wonder
what it would be like…

09:38.227 --> 09:42.795
if, say, you were separated by
something bigger, you know, like uh…

09:43.506 --> 09:45.357
like death. Like her death?

09:45.562 --> 09:48.614
I have given it a fair amount of thought.

09:48.728 --> 09:50.502
Not in a painful way. Just…

09:50.901 --> 09:54.719
quietly slid into death, like a gas leak.

09:54.782 --> 09:56.365
Absolutely. It’s got to be peaceful.

09:56.382 --> 09:58.536
I mean, this is the
mother of your children.

09:58.629 --> 10:00.043
You want her to die…

10:00.368 --> 10:02.538
– No, I’d want it to be a peaceful--
– gentle…

10:02.567 --> 10:06.986
yeah, just like, drift, into a coma,
from which she never awakens.

10:07.037 --> 10:09.284
And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

10:09.398 --> 10:11.261
That’s just it.
People love widowers.

10:11.285 --> 10:14.285
They love widowers. It’s like
the polar opposite of divorced guys.

10:14.316 --> 10:14.993
It’s the best.

10:15.009 --> 10:17.186
It’s like, oh, that poor widower!

10:17.358 --> 10:19.186
You know. If I could only…

10:19.236 --> 10:21.757
– Somehow… somehow…
– .. make him happy.

10:21.835 --> 10:24.906
– ease his pain. 
– cocksuck away his sadness.

11:14.194 --> 11:17.238
I- but I have eight more,
and then I’m done, so…

11:17.379 --> 11:18.316
How many are there?

11:18.329 --> 11:19.400
A hundred and fourteen?

11:19.416 --> 11:23.062
Are you kidding me? You can’t watch over
a hundred episodes of a show in five weeks.

11:23.077 --> 11:25.156
– No.
– It- It’ll melt your brain.

11:25.373 --> 11:28.378
It’s not melting my brain,
it’s blowing my mind.

11:28.402 --> 11:30.331
That’s really bad, Sadie.

11:30.447 --> 11:31.948
You’re not allowed to do that.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.714
My relationship with Lost
is not your business.

11:35.116 --> 11:37.190
It’s extremely personal.

11:38.402 --> 11:39.181
Stop!

11:39.750 --> 11:41.501
Stop it!
– Be nice to your sister.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.938
You guys are gonna
cherish each other one day.

11:44.522 --> 11:46.836
Stop it! Stop!

11:47.726 --> 11:49.916
Honey, it’s your birthday,
you don’t need to go to the store.

11:49.934 --> 11:51.197
I know, just five minutes.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.080
Desi and Jodi are fighting.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.924
All right, five minutes.
But then I’m pulling you out.

11:56.827 --> 11:58.060
Hi.

11:58.325 --> 12:01.049
Hi. How’s Jodi treating you?

12:01.612 --> 12:02.732
Jodi?

12:02.818 --> 12:04.597
Oh, Jodi’s my new BFF.

12:04.708 --> 12:08.581
She’s like a little kitty cat. Sometimes
she comes and rubs up against my leg.

12:08.859 --> 12:10.659
And you’re a ball of shit.

12:11.136 --> 12:12.508
She loves me.

12:12.625 --> 12:13.825
Huh.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.769
Can you do inventory so that
we can do the sidewalk sale?

12:21.823 --> 12:24.172
And you really need to pay
attention to the numbers

12:24.183 --> 12:27.922
’cause we get like twelve thousand
dollars unaccounted for.

12:28.444 --> 12:30.418
I think it’s probably Desi.

12:31.063 --> 12:33.562
She’s been having a really hard time
using these simple computers,

12:33.569 --> 12:35.426
it’s because she’s stupid.

12:35.966 --> 12:37.934
I think she might be stealing.

12:38.114 --> 12:39.940
She’s not stealing.

12:40.279 --> 12:44.073
She’s our best employee.
She made nine grand last month.

12:44.444 --> 12:45.894
Well, how much did I make?

12:46.066 --> 12:48.466
You brought in twenty-two hundred.

12:48.762 --> 12:49.770
That’s not bad.

12:49.783 --> 12:51.668
Well, that’s not that good.

12:51.856 --> 12:54.267
I mean, I’m not comparing you, but…

12:54.557 --> 12:56.236
you’re not as good.

13:03.633 --> 13:05.224
All right. See you.

13:08.563 --> 13:10.490
I don’t think she’s wearing underwear.

13:11.548 --> 13:12.748
What?

13:12.849 --> 13:14.042
It’s all dark up there.

13:14.369 --> 13:16.913
What…? Why are you looking?

13:16.989 --> 13:18.374
Oh I didn’t mean to look, I just--

13:18.420 --> 13:20.214
It was just like I said, ‘Hey- woah!’

13:20.556 --> 13:21.811
There it- there it was.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.327
Well maybe she’s wearing dark underwear.

13:24.654 --> 13:28.444
Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that has
a picture of a vagina painted on it.

13:28.544 --> 13:29.628
Stop looking.

13:29.660 --> 13:33.400
Maybe some deep oranges and browns
and maybe dark greens?

13:33.408 --> 13:35.228
That would really play up your features.

13:35.252 --> 13:38.370
I’ll just take out my AmEx and
you pick what stuff you think is good.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.308
Good job!

13:46.643 --> 13:47.691
Where’s daddy?

13:47.747 --> 13:49.269
I think he went to poop.

13:49.512 --> 13:51.080
Pete!

13:51.182 --> 13:54.072
Q 80. Suck on that bitch.

13:56.023 --> 13:56.702
Hey!

13:56.732 --> 13:57.960
What are you doing?

13:58.127 --> 13:59.927
Uh, going to the bathroom.

14:02.529 --> 14:04.558
We’re all downstairs waiting for you.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.964
You’ve been up here
for a really long time now.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.599
Oh, I’m almost done.
I’ll be down in a second.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.951
Charlotte just did her first flip on the
trampoline, and she landed on her feet.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.863
She was really proud of herself.

14:15.992 --> 14:17.863
– Oh, that’s great!
– And you missed it.

14:18.328 --> 14:20.286
She- she’ll do it again.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.286
It’s just that this is the fourth
time you’ve gone to the bathroom today.

14:23.660 --> 14:24.673
C’mon, give me a break.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.267
Why is your instinct to escape?

14:27.308 --> 14:28.938
It’s not my instinct to escape from you,

14:28.953 --> 14:32.671
it is my instinct to come into the bathroom
when I need to go to the bathroom.

14:32.953 --> 14:34.239
How come I don’t smell anything?

14:34.330 --> 14:37.330
It’s because I shoved an Altoid up
my ass before I came in here, I mean--

14:37.442 --> 14:38.536
Let me see then.

14:38.658 --> 14:39.968
– What?
– Let me see!

14:39.982 --> 14:41.303
No, I’m not gonna let you see.

14:41.327 --> 14:43.804
You’re not gonna let me see
because you’re not taking a poop.

14:43.827 --> 14:45.426
I’ve been flushing as I go!

14:45.478 --> 14:46.874
You’re flushing as you go?!

14:46.950 --> 14:49.218
Who takes a half hour
to go to the bathroom?

14:49.251 --> 14:50.171
John Goodman.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.319
Don’t press Enter! I’m not
sure I want to make that move!

14:56.791 --> 14:58.191
Thank you.

14:58.914 --> 14:59.820
Wow.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.753
You know, when I started this label,

15:01.818 --> 15:04.737
my dream was to work
with musicians and bands

15:04.839 --> 15:07.360
whose music I just admired so much.

15:07.464 --> 15:10.464
The person that I thought, “My god,
wouldn’t it be incredible to work with”

15:10.571 --> 15:11.975
was Graham Parker.

15:15.766 --> 15:17.421
Tonight we have him.

15:17.681 --> 15:18.810
Solo.

15:18.896 --> 15:21.296
Because we couldn’t afford
to fly in The Rumour.

15:21.998 --> 15:23.118
Graham Parker.

16:13.793 --> 16:15.127
It’s just not my kind of music.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.103
Really. What is your kind of music?

16:17.259 --> 16:18.267
I like Lady Gaga.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.947
Oh, God, of course you do.

16:20.262 --> 16:21.867
– What?
– Shallow dance music.

16:21.934 --> 16:27.892
It’s not. It is fun, and it’s about
release and sex and power--

16:27.893 --> 16:30.978
You know, you don’t have to like it.
It’s really not for you, that’s fine.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.505
This- this is a job. This is not a hobby.

16:33.539 --> 16:36.974
Can’t you love him just as a hobby?

16:37.052 --> 16:41.240
And sign a fifteen year old
hot girl so we can eat?

16:41.328 --> 16:44.778
Graham Parker and The Rumour
had two albums in the Rolling Stone

16:44.789 --> 16:47.789
Top 500 Best Albums of All Time.
Two of ‘em.

16:48.524 --> 16:53.779
If I can just sell ten thousand records
to his hardcore fan base, we’re golden.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.800
The last of Graham
Parker’s fans just died.

17:10.286 --> 17:12.486
– I do know. Hardly.
– .. into a depressive--

17:12.532 --> 17:14.682
Charlotte. Sadie.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.075
Sadie, what are you listening to?

17:17.223 --> 17:18.344
Okay,

17:18.460 --> 17:21.262
this is music that makes people happy.

17:22.012 --> 17:24.003
And this is what people buy.

17:25.690 --> 17:26.810
What?

17:29.224 --> 17:30.344
Right, girls?

17:31.261 --> 17:32.661
Come on, Sadie.

17:38.981 --> 17:42.166
♪.. Like a dungeon dragon,
♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon,

17:42.213 --> 17:46.679
♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon,
♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon,

17:46.703 --> 17:48.802

♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon,
♪Rah Rah! Like a dungeon dragon…

17:54.613 --> 17:55.790
Why did you take it off?

17:55.881 --> 17:57.673
Now, something that really rocks.

17:59.696 --> 18:01.201
This is called good music.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.770
From somebody’s heart.

18:04.803 --> 18:07.019
This is bumming me out.
This isn’t fun.

18:07.094 --> 18:09.794
Just listen to these words, okay?
Just listen to the words.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.083
I don’t understand the words.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.458
This is lyrics, this is poetry.
This is what-

18:19.523 --> 18:22.567
This is what is gonna survive…
in a hundred years.

18:23.096 --> 18:25.093
It just doesn’t make people happy.

18:25.151 --> 18:27.968
It makes me happy.
I can dance to it.

18:33.317 --> 18:36.455
You’re the only one
in the room who’s happy.

18:44.335 --> 18:47.067
Sometimes, I wish
just one of you had a dick.

18:47.717 --> 18:49.778
Well, we don’t want one.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.851
Is there something that you can do
to be helping me right now?

19:01.916 --> 19:04.015
Yeah, I’m ready to help.
Just tell me what to do.

19:04.047 --> 19:06.771
Can you go get a lunch box or something?

19:06.845 --> 19:08.060
For me or for them?

19:09.364 --> 19:11.939
Charlotte! I’ve got a test!

19:12.015 --> 19:13.815
I’m coming! I’m coming!

19:14.057 --> 19:16.070
Charlotte, I’m gonna kill you!

19:20.430 --> 19:22.977
– Hi Debbie.
– Hi, any day now, huh?

19:23.035 --> 19:25.056
Not really. Three months, still.

19:25.228 --> 19:26.348
– Hi.
– Hi.

19:26.393 --> 19:28.945
Katie’s dying for a play date.
Let’s hook these two up.

19:28.956 --> 19:30.445
– That would be great, okay.
– Great.

19:30.450 --> 19:31.979
– Hey, I’ll call you.
– Okay. Great.

19:32.011 --> 19:33.252
Hey. No.

19:33.429 --> 19:34.861
– “No” what?
– No.

19:34.932 --> 19:36.332
– What?
– No.

19:36.453 --> 19:37.461
She’s sweet.

19:37.490 --> 19:38.890
She’s evil.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.031
Hello.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.031
– Hi.
– Hi.

19:42.259 --> 19:43.225
Listen, uhm…

19:43.266 --> 19:45.334
Charlotte really needs
to get here on time

19:45.345 --> 19:47.802
because she needs the
extra time to just settle in.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.722
Oh… We are on time.

19:49.769 --> 19:52.058
Being on time means being early.

19:52.796 --> 19:53.738
Oh. Okay.

19:53.754 --> 19:55.861
Well, it’s nice to see you in class.

19:56.025 --> 19:57.462
We’d like to see more of you.

19:57.666 --> 19:58.851
I come t--

19:59.587 --> 20:00.945
Hi Debbie!

20:01.066 --> 20:02.313
Grandma Molly.

20:02.337 --> 20:03.618
– How are you?
– Hey.

20:03.639 --> 20:05.957
I’m so happy about the science fair.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.307
– Thank you for helping.
– It’s going very well I heard.

20:08.315 --> 20:08.923
Yeah.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.501
I love you, you look so beautiful.

20:12.209 --> 20:15.292
Happy birthday! I just learned
it’s your fortieth.

20:15.332 --> 20:16.886
Are you forty?

20:17.225 --> 20:18.019
Yeah.

20:18.066 --> 20:21.066
I remember when I was forty,
and then I blinked,

20:21.308 --> 20:23.462
and there I was, going to be ninety.

20:23.517 --> 20:25.415
My God, where did it go?

20:25.495 --> 20:28.678
One day you’re gonna blink,
and you’re gonna be ninety.

20:28.721 --> 20:32.593
And I won’t be around to see it.
And that makes me very sad.

20:32.675 --> 20:34.672
I’m telling you, I’m warning you.

20:34.743 --> 20:36.860
Don’t blink. Don’t blink!

20:47.885 --> 20:51.375
And then you missed the mortgage payment,
and that’s the second mortgage.

20:51.389 --> 20:53.975
You’ve got to tighten your belt.
You’ve got to go home, sit down,

20:54.001 --> 20:57.001
look at your expenses,
come clean with Debbie.

20:57.093 --> 20:58.778
Oh, God. I can’t tell Debbie.

20:58.801 --> 20:59.950
You got to tell her, Pete.

20:59.977 --> 21:02.826
I mean, she knows it’s bad,
but she has no idea just how bad.

21:02.867 --> 21:05.786
You can sell the house,
it will really buy you some time.

21:05.818 --> 21:07.964
No, no. Debbie’s not really
into selling the house.

21:07.979 --> 21:11.474
As your business manager and
your friend, I can’t recommend that.

21:12.511 --> 21:14.675
Hey, how funny would it be
if I bought your house?

21:14.707 --> 21:15.827
Okay…

21:16.433 --> 21:17.993
– Bye.
– Hang in there.

21:24.820 --> 21:27.645
<i>From the Retro label,
unfiltered, comes the first</i>

21:27.665 --> 21:30.928
<i>Graham Parker and the Rumour
record in thirty years.</i>

21:31.154 --> 21:32.974
When we played together,

21:33.600 --> 21:38.621
the magic was just ridiculous,
and I think what we got is just so great.

21:38.980 --> 21:39.805
What are you doing?

21:39.827 --> 21:42.962
I’m contextualizing him as one
of the great figures in rock history.

21:43.017 --> 21:46.085
Look, you can’t show him in his prime

21:46.125 --> 21:49.958
in ‘77 and then jump straight
to him as he is now.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.310
It’s terrifying. You have to reverse it.

21:52.333 --> 21:55.096
You’ve got to show him as he is now
very briefly,

21:55.173 --> 21:57.623
and then show him in 1977.

21:57.811 --> 21:59.161
You have to “Benjamin Button” it.

21:59.186 --> 22:02.152
I don’t know what you’re talking about,
okay? All rock stars are older now.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.689
Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger--

22:04.690 --> 22:05.383
Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger--
– Paul McCartney.

22:05.424 --> 22:09.132
Okay, stop it. Everybody that you are
mentioning looks like an old woman now.

22:09.596 --> 22:12.398
You’re just mentioning
a bunch of Jessica Tandys.

22:12.704 --> 22:14.498
Keith Richards gets away with it.

22:14.538 --> 22:17.537
But that’s because Keith Richards
looked seventy when he was forty,

22:17.611 --> 22:20.202
and now that he’s seventy,
he looks sixty nine.

22:21.243 --> 22:22.343
He’s regenerating.

22:22.528 --> 22:24.744
I like it, and I think
Graham Parker is sexy.

22:24.825 --> 22:25.979
Wow- would you fuck him?

22:26.072 --> 22:27.697
– Yes!
– You…

22:28.658 --> 22:30.744
You’d fuck him, and you won’t fuck me?

22:30.759 --> 22:33.335
I mean, I kind of fucked you once,
like- if you could have finished,

22:33.351 --> 22:34.278
you--
– Oh, I finished.

22:34.293 --> 22:37.413
Okay, you know what now, enough of
who fucked who and who finished what.

22:37.468 --> 22:38.593
I finished.

22:38.671 --> 22:41.905
Look. It’s a retro label.
That’s our niche. That’s our market.

22:41.915 --> 22:45.038
It costs money to break new bands,
I can’t- well I can’t do that.

22:45.063 --> 22:47.506
Okay. And also you’re the guy
who turned down Arcade Fire.

22:47.537 --> 22:48.934
Everybody turned down Arcade Fire.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.450
It’s crazy, there’s so many of them!

22:50.470 --> 22:52.261
We don’t have the money
to market a new band.

22:52.278 --> 22:54.392
We just need to make
Graham seem relevant.

22:55.727 --> 22:56.700
Who is he talking to?

22:56.761 --> 22:58.068
Um, the Jewish Journal.

22:58.123 --> 22:59.614
The Jewish Journal?

22:59.673 --> 23:04.436
Apparently, old Jews are the only ones
who still buy hard copies of records.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.646
Because they don’t like to download music.

23:06.876 --> 23:09.318
Because they don’t know
what downloading means.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.491
Why is this album
different from any other album?

23:13.660 --> 23:14.647
It isn’t.

23:15.137 --> 23:16.284
What- what is he wearing?

23:16.329 --> 23:18.326
Um, it’s a hat with the Oreo logo on it.

23:18.342 --> 23:18.920
Why?

23:18.990 --> 23:21.764
I don’t think he’s being ironic,
I think he just really likes Oreos.

23:21.998 --> 23:24.323
Look. The Paul Westerberg record did okay.

23:24.427 --> 23:27.308
Frank Black did all right.
The Haircut 100, not so much.

23:27.342 --> 23:29.949
We have to break this record.
Otherwise, we’re not here next year.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.801
He’s coming. He’s coming.
Oreo man is coming.

23:31.825 --> 23:33.075
Hey guys, how are ya?

23:33.098 --> 23:34.283
– Good, man!
– .. to see you.

23:34.298 --> 23:36.087
– Aren’t cookies the best?
– Yeah.

23:36.330 --> 23:38.812
Jewish Journal guy loves the record.

23:38.851 --> 23:39.648
Great!

23:39.677 --> 23:41.130
Got a bit of a problem though.

23:41.402 --> 23:42.771
Touch of gout.

23:42.930 --> 23:43.721
Gout?

23:43.752 --> 23:46.671
Yeah, my whole family,
they all had gout.

23:46.737 --> 23:49.130
– Jesus.
– That’s very unfortunate.

23:49.171 --> 23:54.493
My auntie Queenie, she had a foot
like the size of a small pig.

23:54.519 --> 23:55.719
I’ve got a photo of it.

23:55.791 --> 23:58.298
I’d love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

23:58.329 --> 24:00.030
And a couple of bunions as well.

24:00.089 --> 24:00.858
Fuck!

24:00.914 --> 24:04.054
I’ve got to go to the podiatrist, and
I hope he can shoot me up with something.

24:04.140 --> 24:06.715
Yeah, well, let’s uh-
let’s get you to the podiatrist.

24:07.757 --> 24:09.669
– Bye, Graham.
– See you later, Graham.

24:09.895 --> 24:11.062
Good luck with your gout.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.376
Rock and Roll, baby.

24:12.971 --> 24:17.570
The happiest period in people’s
lives is from age forty to sixty.

24:18.057 --> 24:21.382
So this is it. We’re in it, right now.

24:21.510 --> 24:22.945
– It’s true!
– Says who?

24:23.055 --> 24:25.234
Says a lot of people,
most people say that.

24:25.257 --> 24:25.867
Ηuh.

24:25.890 --> 24:31.491
We have everything we need
right now to be completely happy.

24:31.764 --> 24:33.657
We’re gonna blink and be ninety.

24:33.672 --> 24:34.328
What?

24:34.336 --> 24:36.968
So, let’s just choose to be happy.

24:37.126 --> 24:38.662
Yeah. Yeah!

24:38.682 --> 24:40.084
Your eyes are kind of glazing over.

24:40.099 --> 24:41.850
No, I’m just, um- processing it all.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.487
Some of these I wrote for you.

24:43.965 --> 24:45.909
So, we have to exercise every day.

24:46.412 --> 24:48.206
Spend more time alone together.

24:48.300 --> 24:50.902
We have to go to the therapist every week.

24:51.451 --> 24:52.860
It’s a little pricey.

24:52.944 --> 24:55.756
No stressing over tiny things.

24:55.852 --> 24:58.068
Yeah, that’s good.
You should do that. Mm-hmm.

24:58.123 --> 24:59.995
We have to get more involved in school…

25:00.990 --> 25:02.831
Have more patience with the kids,

25:02.950 --> 25:04.865
and we need to work on our anger.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.685
I- Yeah, I think it would be good
if you could take care of your anger.

25:07.692 --> 25:08.892
No, I said both of us.

25:08.931 --> 25:10.432
That’s what I said. Our anger.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.932
Okay. And no more smoking…

25:12.997 --> 25:15.119
Yeah, you’ve got to get-
you’ve got to cut that out.

25:15.265 --> 25:18.583
I don’t want to make this about
a fight, I want it to just be positive.

25:19.175 --> 25:20.113
Sorry.

25:20.810 --> 25:23.721
Okay, and then no more
holding on to resentments.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.753
We have to just let that go.

25:25.820 --> 25:28.489
So, if- you’re saying that if
we’re arguing and I apologize,

25:28.499 --> 25:30.899
you’ll let it go and not
throw it back in my face later?

25:31.466 --> 25:33.979
Well, I don’t do that, but I will

25:34.278 --> 25:36.690
continue not to do that.

25:37.923 --> 25:39.366
And what did you write?

25:39.546 --> 25:41.553
All of that. That’s plenty.
That’s a lot.

25:41.726 --> 25:43.967
And you’re gonna eat better?

25:44.040 --> 25:46.528
Oh, yeah yeah. I’ve been
doing a decent job, I mean-

25:46.567 --> 25:49.486
but I don’t think there’s anything wrong
with having some fries every now and again.

25:49.567 --> 25:51.072
And then I’ll smoke that day.

25:51.365 --> 25:52.455
That’s not the same thing.

25:52.494 --> 25:53.596
It is the same thing.

25:53.643 --> 25:54.627
I like fries.

25:54.687 --> 25:59.005
And the other thing is your
dad stuff, the not letting him…

25:59.054 --> 26:01.616
you know, guilt trip you all the time,
because that puts a lot of

26:01.625 --> 26:05.232
pressure on you, and stress and then
the whole family feels it and

26:05.259 --> 26:08.259
he’s a grown man,
and he’s not our responsibility.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.514
And you’re not giving him
money anymore, right?

26:11.426 --> 26:13.005
No, no I haven’t been giving him money.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.790
I haven’t done that for years, I told you.

26:14.945 --> 26:16.493
Can you please put that down?

26:20.094 --> 26:22.795
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

26:22.826 --> 26:25.232
You sure you don’t want us to
just do a joint birthday party?

26:25.258 --> 26:25.991
No.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.604
– We always used to.
– No.

26:28.401 --> 26:30.729
Did Jodi tell you
she thinks Desi’s stealing?

26:31.081 --> 26:32.471
– Are you serious?
– Mm-hmm.

26:33.034 --> 26:33.949
How much?

26:34.046 --> 26:35.590
Twelve thousand dollars.

26:36.409 --> 26:38.809
Oh, Dod. And Desi’s taking it?

26:38.872 --> 26:41.469
Well, I don’t know.
That’s what Jodi said.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.584
We really need the store to work.

26:44.688 --> 26:45.983
It is.

26:46.445 --> 26:48.709
Don’t put that kind of pressure on me.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.250
No no, I- I…

26:50.485 --> 26:52.285
That’s not what I mean, I’m just…

26:53.302 --> 26:55.302
Are you nervous about money?

26:55.420 --> 26:56.596
Are we okay?

26:56.948 --> 26:58.768
– Yeah!
– Right.

26:59.477 --> 27:02.374
Maybe we just suck it up so because
she’s clearly earning much more

27:02.385 --> 27:04.185
than any other employee we have.

27:04.343 --> 27:06.534
Oh, yeah. For sure.
We can’t fire her.

27:06.579 --> 27:08.471
We’re barely breaking even with her.

27:08.510 --> 27:10.206
That’s why we have to keep her.

27:10.792 --> 27:13.211
Look at this, she’s making out
with somebody.

27:17.165 --> 27:18.764
Is she screwing him?

27:18.871 --> 27:20.686
That might be like a dry hump.

27:20.780 --> 27:23.180
Look at the position of her skirt.

27:23.452 --> 27:25.348
That’s too grainy to know for sure.

27:26.938 --> 27:30.092
Oh my god, this is the middle of the day,
customers could be in there.

27:30.118 --> 27:31.638
At least she’s getting some.

27:31.655 --> 27:32.770
What did you say?

27:32.887 --> 27:34.520
“At least she’s getting some”?

27:34.889 --> 27:36.277
Yeah.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.663
What are you talking about?

27:37.680 --> 27:40.563
We had sex the other night, you have
to give me a little credit for that.

27:40.585 --> 27:42.207
It’s not about credit.

27:42.553 --> 27:45.675
It’s about- we just- we need
to have more passion.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.276
Like this.

27:47.277 --> 27:48.821
That’s not passion, that’s-

27:48.890 --> 27:50.610
It looks like passionate to me.

27:50.641 --> 27:51.548
What?

27:55.263 --> 27:57.221
– What is she doing?
– Okay-

27:57.573 --> 28:01.776
Oh my God. Oh my God!
Oh my God!

28:02.800 --> 28:04.274
Don’t do that!

28:04.285 --> 28:05.298
What am I doing?

28:05.321 --> 28:07.212
Don’t fart in the bed!

28:07.244 --> 28:08.915
I’m not, it’s the springs.

28:08.927 --> 28:12.823
This is why we never have sex.
That’s disgusting. You’re gross.

28:12.847 --> 28:14.907
– I don’t know what you’re talking about.
– You so--

28:16.189 --> 28:17.391
God!

28:17.614 --> 28:20.658
Sadie. Sadie, Sadie!

28:20.690 --> 28:22.690
Sadie, Sadie!
– Charlotte,

28:22.887 --> 28:24.252
I’m doing my homework.

28:24.297 --> 28:25.576
Okay, watch this, watch it.

28:25.889 --> 28:28.824
There’s a haunted cow back here,

28:28.881 --> 28:33.066
and I’m pretty sure it does have milk!

28:41.964 --> 28:43.946
Did you see that?
They took me away.

28:46.211 --> 28:49.079
You’re no fun.
You never want to play.

28:49.672 --> 28:52.669
Charlotte. How many times do I
to have tell you--

28:52.693 --> 28:53.813
Sadie!

28:53.973 --> 28:57.822
Sadie, Sadie!
Sadie…

28:57.963 --> 28:59.158
is boring!

29:09.149 --> 29:12.276
You’re so mean
since your body got weird.

29:13.198 --> 29:14.451
Close the door.

29:14.468 --> 29:15.868
You’re no fun.

30:16.492 --> 30:18.844
If you can just move,
just a little bit more.

30:19.242 --> 30:20.642
– Oh shit!
– It’s okay.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.613
One of my boob is in there!

30:25.631 --> 30:27.714
Pete, did I tell you that
my son’s going to Stanford?

30:27.720 --> 30:29.043
– No, that’s great!
– Oh, great.

30:29.068 --> 30:30.784
Great for us and great for him.

30:30.810 --> 30:32.081
– Cough again.
– Let’s go.

30:33.981 --> 30:35.322
Everything looks good.

30:35.387 --> 30:37.135
Your face is close to my face.

30:37.599 --> 30:39.635
Descending colon…

30:39.674 --> 30:42.089
I’m about four feet in right now.

30:42.161 --> 30:43.511
That’s what he said.

30:47.086 --> 30:49.232
Are- are you a grinder?
Do you grind your teeth?

30:49.270 --> 30:51.070
I grind all night.

30:54.567 --> 30:56.283
I think we need to turn the gas down.

30:56.303 --> 30:57.197
Turn it up!

30:57.253 --> 30:59.127
No, we’re gonna turn it down.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.717
Turn it up!

31:10.366 --> 31:12.015
Do you have to
breathe right on my neck?

31:12.039 --> 31:12.774
Sorry.

31:13.629 --> 31:15.122
What are you all doing for Christmas?

31:15.146 --> 31:17.200
Uhm. I don’t know.

31:17.315 --> 31:18.742
Do you have a tree and everything?

31:18.768 --> 31:19.515
Mm-hmm.

31:19.539 --> 31:20.536
– Ain’t that fun…

31:20.654 --> 31:21.902
– Hi, I-
– .. Get in the spirit.

31:21.917 --> 31:23.438
Sorry, I just have one quick question.

31:23.450 --> 31:25.986
On your form you said
you were born in 1974,

31:26.020 --> 31:29.502
but your paper, it said 1972,
so I just need to know which it is.

31:29.524 --> 31:31.084
Oh. It’s 1974.

31:31.104 --> 31:36.451
Oh it- uhm. Because on your last form,
you said that you were born in 1975.

31:36.564 --> 31:39.171
Didn’t you tell me you were born in 1976?

31:39.242 --> 31:41.155
No.
That’s funny.

31:41.383 --> 31:43.537
So you want to go with 1974?

31:43.681 --> 31:47.585
I’m not gonna “go” with 1974, it is 1974.

31:48.728 --> 31:49.569
Okay.

31:49.953 --> 31:52.599
Just remember to write 1974 every time.

31:53.025 --> 31:56.458
It’s okay. It’s 1976.

31:57.934 --> 32:00.064
I lie about my age, okay?

32:00.110 --> 32:01.541
– Okay!
– Okay?

32:01.631 --> 32:03.259
Okay? Okay?

32:03.293 --> 32:04.761
– Okay!
– Okay.

32:05.477 --> 32:06.581
You’re tightening up.

32:06.651 --> 32:08.211
Oh my gosh.

32:08.461 --> 32:09.969
I know how old you are.

32:10.227 --> 32:11.857
By counting the rings!

32:12.658 --> 32:14.342
Little gyno joke.

32:15.264 --> 32:18.193
Oh my God. Please!

32:22.079 --> 32:23.271
What are you doing?

32:24.160 --> 32:26.560
Getting ready to go for my ride.

32:27.193 --> 32:28.573
Do you want a blow job?

32:28.657 --> 32:29.292
Yeah.

32:29.675 --> 32:30.386
Why?

32:30.396 --> 32:32.796
I really want a cigarette right now.

32:33.171 --> 32:34.792
Well, happy to help.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.528
Charlotte, where is my backpack?

32:39.309 --> 32:40.869
Hello?

32:41.687 --> 32:42.544
Mom’s busy!

32:42.559 --> 32:44.627
Why are you locking the door?

32:44.670 --> 32:46.283
Mom! What’s going on in there?

32:46.291 --> 32:47.928
Mom, I can’t be late for school,

32:47.946 --> 32:49.748
– I have a test!
– Mommy can’t talk right now!

32:49.777 --> 32:50.920
This isn’t funny, Mom.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.100
I need to go.
– Mom, let me in!

32:53.139 --> 32:53.795
Please!

32:53.819 --> 32:55.144
That’s not gonna help!

32:55.163 --> 32:57.074
Put on your shoes.
We’ll meet you in the car.

32:57.597 --> 32:58.754
Sadie hurt me!

32:58.796 --> 32:59.894
I didn’t!

32:59.902 --> 33:00.817
Hit her back!

33:00.852 --> 33:02.700
She’s faking!

33:02.764 --> 33:05.035
– I’m not. Please!
– Go downstairs!

33:05.051 --> 33:06.918
– Daddy, let me in-
– Stop crying!

33:06.947 --> 33:08.343
– Stop crying!
– Stop it!

33:08.363 --> 33:09.928
– God damn it!
– Mum, get out!

33:09.944 --> 33:11.946
– Please Sadie, shut up!
– Mum, you need to come out.

33:11.959 --> 33:13.680
– Shut up!
– Stop it!

33:13.697 --> 33:15.879
– Open the door!
– Go away!

33:15.903 --> 33:17.715
– Open it!
– Please!

33:17.763 --> 33:18.964
Forget it.

33:18.987 --> 33:22.031
No. Don’t forget it. Don’t forget it.
Don’t, don’t!

33:22.797 --> 33:24.281
Oh God…

33:25.588 --> 33:27.696
Hey, Boychik.

33:28.688 --> 33:29.808
Hey.

33:32.788 --> 33:35.395
That’s the eleven o’clock from London.

33:35.436 --> 33:39.207
Drop something valuable, you shit!

33:40.760 --> 33:42.440
How are you?

33:42.952 --> 33:43.770
Loud.

33:43.786 --> 33:45.586
Every eight minutes, buddy.

33:47.374 --> 33:49.638
You look pretty good.
Your hair is different.

33:49.712 --> 33:51.443
Yeah, I’m growing it out.

33:51.569 --> 33:52.376
Oh, I’d get it cut.

33:52.399 --> 33:54.246
Daddy, you never play with me.

33:54.262 --> 33:57.236
I do but right now look who
I’m talking to!

33:57.268 --> 33:59.368
– Hi.
– It’s your brother!

33:59.839 --> 34:00.633
Alright, say-

34:00.648 --> 34:02.914
You don’t look like my brother.

34:02.928 --> 34:06.660
I told you honey, that’s
’cause of the egg donor.

34:06.691 --> 34:07.285
Remember?

34:07.311 --> 34:09.185
I came from a test tube.

34:12.254 --> 34:14.290
– How’s business?
– It’s not good.

34:14.493 --> 34:15.897
Nobody wants curtains.

34:16.570 --> 34:18.927
They think of it like a luxury.
It’s not a luxury.

34:19.532 --> 34:21.958
You need shade, you need privacy.

34:22.246 --> 34:24.378
Who wants to have
other people watch you fuck?

34:25.049 --> 34:26.289
I- I know how you feel. You know,

34:26.304 --> 34:28.899
my business is going through
some growing pains right now.

34:28.928 --> 34:30.239
– Oh, don’t jump on Daddy,
– Daddy. - Daddy!

34:30.248 --> 34:32.097
be careful, don’t jump,
don’t jump on Daddy!

34:32.530 --> 34:35.284
Remember, Daddy has high blood what?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.598
– High blood pressure.
– That’s right.

34:38.635 --> 34:41.023
Can you go outside
without me for a little bit?

34:41.109 --> 34:43.045
Don’t go near that little pool!

34:43.110 --> 34:43.983
All right?

34:44.018 --> 34:47.139
Do the Three Stooges routine
you were practicing.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.415
I can’t tell them apart.

34:49.485 --> 34:52.208
I swear to god. I need tattoos.

34:53.496 --> 34:56.971
Look, uh… I wanted
to talk to you about…

34:58.067 --> 35:00.166
scaling back a little bit.

35:00.803 --> 35:04.684
You know, Deb and I are
thinking about selling the house.

35:04.710 --> 35:06.137
I think that house is more than you need,

35:06.160 --> 35:08.897
I think it was too big of
a purchase when you made it.

35:08.921 --> 35:12.521
Yeah. In the meantime, I’m gonna
have to make some changes.

35:13.827 --> 35:15.027
Gonna have to cut back.

35:15.301 --> 35:16.535
I understand.

35:16.846 --> 35:17.785
What do you mean?

35:17.844 --> 35:19.152
– With you.
– Oh.

35:19.584 --> 35:20.636
I’m sorry, what?

35:20.712 --> 35:22.620
I can’t lend you any more money.

35:22.847 --> 35:26.524
No, that’s a- that’s a bad idea.
That’s not the way to cut back.

35:26.816 --> 35:28.579
I- I have three children, here.

35:28.645 --> 35:31.009
What about Claire?
Why can’t she get a job?

35:31.074 --> 35:32.853
Claire takes care of your brothers!

35:32.860 --> 35:33.946
What do you want her to do?

35:33.956 --> 35:36.358
If she goes to work, then
I’ve got to hire somebody.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.428
Well you’ve got to figure something out
because I can’t do it. I can’t do it!

35:39.446 --> 35:41.113
Okay, fine. Why don’t we kill them?

35:41.114 --> 35:44.080
Come on, we’ll kill two of them.
I’ll keep the best one.

35:44.361 --> 35:46.189
Really,
it will save us both a lot of trouble.

35:46.234 --> 35:47.671
– Come on-
– Line up!

35:47.805 --> 35:49.416
 Line up for murder! Come on!

35:50.862 --> 35:52.250
Who wants to be killed?

35:52.288 --> 35:53.586
– I do!
– Okay,

35:53.599 --> 35:56.245
we’re eliminating one already
we’re cheaper. You’re gone!

35:56.253 --> 35:58.169
– Murder me!
– Okay! Boom, dead!

35:58.185 --> 36:00.216
– Oh I’m dead!
– You’re dead, you’re dead!

36:00.228 --> 36:03.565
All right, the kids are murdered.
That will save us some money.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.131
Why would you have three kids, anyway?

36:05.147 --> 36:07.121
I mean, you’re sixty years old.
You have no money-

36:07.139 --> 36:09.261
Because Claire wanted a baby.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.793
If we didn’t at least try,
she would have left me.

36:11.829 --> 36:13.618
She was forty-five years old.

36:13.820 --> 36:15.234
Nobody thought it would take.

36:15.248 --> 36:17.474
The doctor when we were doing
in vitro, was winking at me

36:17.491 --> 36:19.218
like, “Don’t worry, don’t worry.”

36:19.399 --> 36:20.866
We were very unlucky.

36:20.867 --> 36:23.099
And now we have these
three beautiful children…

36:23.328 --> 36:25.536
Come on. I gotta tell you something.

36:32.293 --> 36:33.425
What?

36:36.723 --> 36:38.431
Your mother wanted you aborted.

36:38.537 --> 36:39.970
Oh, Jesus Christ.

36:40.033 --> 36:42.158
No no. It’s the truth.

36:42.260 --> 36:44.666
You know, it was the seventies.
We were twenty-two years old.

36:44.692 --> 36:48.549
That’s what everybody did. You did
some blow, had sex, had an abortion.

36:48.698 --> 36:49.992
– Really?
– Yes.

36:50.046 --> 36:52.008
We were on the way to the doctor’s office.

36:52.125 --> 36:54.841
I said, “Let’s stop,
have a pizza, talk about it,

36:54.953 --> 36:57.599
if you still want to do it
after lunch, it’s okay.”

36:57.859 --> 36:59.661
The pizza saved your life.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.314
But don’t give me money.

37:01.508 --> 37:03.408
Because I’m not worth it.

37:03.588 --> 37:06.452
So how much do I owe you then
for saving my life?

37:06.509 --> 37:08.999
I don’t have a number.
You just keep giving like you’re giving.

37:09.025 --> 37:10.452
Hey! Oh, Hi Pete!

37:10.615 --> 37:11.545
– Hey!
– Hey!

37:11.577 --> 37:12.668
Why aren’t you playing with kids?

37:12.717 --> 37:14.144
We were playing with them all day.

37:14.178 --> 37:15.675
Pete’s just uh…

37:15.967 --> 37:20.199
talking to me about his fortieth birthday
party. Whatever I can do to help.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.542
Okay. Did you feed them?

37:21.585 --> 37:23.403
I’d fed half of one.

37:24.469 --> 37:27.584
Let’s go. Okay, the family will feed them.

37:27.670 --> 37:30.670
Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel?

37:34.341 --> 37:38.444
Hi, I’m looking for my dad.
I mean, an older man?

37:50.501 --> 37:52.901
So how’s Sony treating Pete?

37:53.346 --> 37:56.773
Oh, he’s not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

37:56.893 --> 38:01.640
Now he’s able to focus on the artists
that he’s really passionate about.

38:03.166 --> 38:04.515
How’s Sadie doing?

38:04.563 --> 38:07.952
Last time I on  saw her she was
throwing her Cheerios on the floor.

38:08.484 --> 38:10.575
What a mess.
– Right.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.790
She just got her period.

38:15.003 --> 38:16.471
Well…

38:17.167 --> 38:20.287
I guess she’s not a little baby anymore.

38:20.910 --> 38:23.048
It would be nice to see
more of each other.

38:23.110 --> 38:25.029
Well, we can certainly arrange for that.

38:25.067 --> 38:26.693
I’d love to see the girls.

38:26.733 --> 38:28.504
– That would be nice.
– Mm-hmm.

38:30.886 --> 38:35.336
Do you have a day that was better-
like, a good day?

38:35.391 --> 38:38.529
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

38:38.571 --> 38:41.357
– Soccer competitions, kids exams.
– Right, right.

38:41.472 --> 38:45.368
I mean, we’re both so busy. I mean I have
young children, you have young children,

38:45.375 --> 38:49.685
I… I don’t think we should judge
ourselves too harshly about that.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.901
I know, I wasn’t.
I didn’t say anything.

38:54.045 --> 38:57.120
No, I’m glad we’re here,
I think we should- this is-

38:57.133 --> 39:01.421
this is a good start and that we can
spend more time together, it’d be nice.

39:02.994 --> 39:04.469
It would be nice.

39:08.007 --> 39:09.793
Do you want to see pictures of the kids?

39:09.926 --> 39:11.326
Oh, yeah.

39:12.588 --> 39:14.388
This is, uh…

39:14.413 --> 39:17.288
This is Kell, my son, he’s-

39:17.427 --> 39:19.534
He’s handsome. He’s thirteen?

39:19.565 --> 39:20.685
Mm-hmm.

39:20.996 --> 39:24.462
And that’s Alexandra, my daughter,

39:24.548 --> 39:26.267
she’s a real perfectionist.

39:26.753 --> 39:28.211
A lot- a lot like you.

39:28.579 --> 39:31.305
That’s the whole gang at Cabo.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.228
Now…

39:33.373 --> 39:35.558
Excuse me dear,
I’ve got to use the restroom.

39:35.601 --> 39:36.816
Be right back.
– Okay.

40:10.652 --> 40:13.462
Daddy and I are making some changes,

40:13.721 --> 40:16.196
so that we can be happier
and healthier,

40:16.386 --> 40:19.281
and we’re starting with
this meal that I prepared.

40:19.354 --> 40:20.515
I think it looks great.

40:20.561 --> 40:21.484
Doesn’t it look good?

40:21.564 --> 40:23.023
What is that, grilled cheeses?

40:23.202 --> 40:24.715
No, baked- baked tofu.

40:24.799 --> 40:25.504
Aw.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.053
 It’s actually really tasty.

40:27.101 --> 40:31.137
And the lettuce is so fresh and
tasty that you forget how good

40:31.162 --> 40:34.355
lettuce tastes on its own
without dressing.

40:34.374 --> 40:37.801
No, dressing always gets in the way
of the natural taste of the lettuce.

40:37.905 --> 40:42.762
And another thing we’ve
decided is to cut back on…

40:43.382 --> 40:45.161
all of the electronics we use.

40:45.461 --> 40:50.927
Basically, what we’re gonna do is get rid
of the wi-fi and only use the computer

40:50.965 --> 40:52.940
– what?
– from 8 to 8:30 at night.

40:52.947 --> 40:54.471
How are we going to go on the computer?

40:54.479 --> 40:57.126
Well we’re gonna have
a hard line in the kitchen.

40:57.167 --> 40:58.539
Yeah, we’ll supervise that.

40:58.577 --> 41:01.453
You can’t do this.
You can’t take away the wi-fi!

41:01.469 --> 41:03.646
No wi-fi! Ha-ha-ha!

41:03.691 --> 41:06.180
You don’t spend enough time
with the family when you’re

41:06.259 --> 41:10.071
constantly on your iPhone
and your computer, and

41:10.141 --> 41:13.326
you know, you should-
you’re only here five more years.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.013
So you won’t see me after five years?

41:15.050 --> 41:16.901
No, but you won’t be living with us.

41:17.386 --> 41:19.477
And you should get
to know your little sister.

41:19.516 --> 41:21.196
You’ve got the perfect friend right here.

41:21.251 --> 41:23.155
I don’t want to be friends with her now.

41:23.241 --> 41:26.530
I’ll friends with her when she’s
twenty and a normal person.

41:26.620 --> 41:29.344
I don’t want to hang out with her
when I’m in my twenties.

41:29.399 --> 41:32.264
You’re on your computer too much as it is,
you need to get outside more.

41:32.282 --> 41:33.700
Do some planning outside.

41:33.756 --> 41:37.988
Yeah. You can build things out.
You can build a- a fort outside.

41:38.014 --> 41:38.839
What?

41:38.932 --> 41:41.445
Yeah, build a fort. Play with
your friends and they have-

41:41.472 --> 41:44.126
Make a fort?! Outside?

41:44.613 --> 41:45.556
And do what?

41:45.602 --> 41:47.446
– Have a little-
– Do what in the fort?

41:47.478 --> 41:52.202
When I was a kid we used to
build tree houses and play with sticks.

41:52.259 --> 41:54.499
Nobody plays with sticks.

41:54.676 --> 41:56.569
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

41:56.660 --> 41:57.702
Play Kick the Can.

41:57.748 --> 41:59.217
Look for dead bodies.

41:59.329 --> 42:01.027
It’s fun. That’s fun to do.

42:01.053 --> 42:03.894
Get a tire and then take a stick
and run down the street with it.

42:03.903 --> 42:06.303
Nobody does that crap. It’s 2012.

42:06.387 --> 42:07.972
You don’t need technology.

42:08.035 --> 42:09.835
No technology!

42:09.937 --> 42:10.943
Charlotte, put that down.

42:10.986 --> 42:15.154
I don’t need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

42:15.209 --> 42:16.667
I don’t do anything bad.

42:16.702 --> 42:17.948
Nobody said you were bad.

42:17.971 --> 42:21.277
I don’t do things I’m not supposed to.
I don’t illegally download music.

42:21.355 --> 42:23.155
I don’t look at porn like Wendy.

42:23.413 --> 42:26.454
She is up to no good. She’s not
allowed to come over here anymore.

42:26.513 --> 42:27.299
What’s porn?

42:27.331 --> 42:28.159
No, she said corn.

42:28.174 --> 42:31.203
This isn’t turning out
the way I wanted it to.

42:31.242 --> 42:32.328
I’m not hungry.

42:32.374 --> 42:33.379
No computer.

42:33.382 --> 42:34.520
Listen to your mom!

42:34.635 --> 42:36.484
I need to use it for my homework.

42:39.026 --> 42:40.515
She’s outplaying us.

42:41.162 --> 42:43.867
I know. She’s tough.

42:47.028 --> 42:48.908
This is the best birthday present.

42:48.912 --> 42:52.034
It’s good to get away, you know? We haven’t
been to Laguna without the kids in years.

42:52.042 --> 42:52.750
I know!

42:52.754 --> 42:54.176
If we’re happy, they’re happy.

42:54.187 --> 42:58.622
Yeah. I mean I can’t take it. With the
hormones, and the crying, and

42:58.623 --> 43:00.308
– Jesus.
– “do my homework”…

43:00.328 --> 43:01.658
Them’s little bitches!

43:01.667 --> 43:03.072
Lil’ bitches!

43:03.411 --> 43:05.143
Bugging us for shit all the time.

43:05.167 --> 43:07.307
And they never appreciate anything.

43:07.331 --> 43:10.328
No, God no. They’re selfish assholes.

43:12.191 --> 43:13.579
Aw, I feel bad.

43:14.338 --> 43:16.135
I love them.
– I know.

43:16.159 --> 43:18.710
I miss them already.
Should we go home?

43:19.207 --> 43:19.994
Nah.

44:02.980 --> 44:03.754
Why do we fight?

44:03.789 --> 44:05.485
I don’t know, it makes no sense at all.

44:05.510 --> 44:06.906
It makes no sense.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.766
When we get in a fight…

44:08.767 --> 44:11.839
look in my eyes, and let’s remember
this moment right now,

44:11.886 --> 44:13.727
and know that never have to fight.

44:14.005 --> 44:15.587
But you’re such a dick sometimes.

44:15.595 --> 44:17.422
I know, I am a dick sometimes.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.770
People think I’m so nice,
but I’m such a dick.

44:20.137 --> 44:21.760
Thank you for admitting that.

44:22.123 --> 44:23.360
And you get so mad at me.

44:23.368 --> 44:25.144
– Oh my God.
– I feel like you wanna kill me.

44:25.154 --> 44:26.954
I do wanna kill you.

44:27.001 --> 44:27.873
How would you do it?

44:28.061 --> 44:30.437
I don’t know… poison you.

44:30.658 --> 44:34.390
I’d poison your cupcakes that
you pretend not to eat everyday.

44:34.490 --> 44:37.800
And just put like enough in
to slowly weaken you.

44:37.810 --> 44:38.339
I love it.

44:38.340 --> 44:40.306
I would enjoy our last
few months together.

44:40.309 --> 44:40.915
Me too.

44:40.916 --> 44:43.046
’Cause you’d be so weak and like sweet,

44:43.055 --> 44:46.397
and I could take care of you and-
but while killing you.

44:46.458 --> 44:48.393
See? You know what I love about us?

44:48.489 --> 44:50.010
You can still surprise me.

44:50.055 --> 44:53.263
I figured for sure you’d knock me out
with one fell swoop, poison me.

44:53.271 --> 44:55.671
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

44:57.024 --> 44:58.597
Have you ever thought about killing me?

44:58.613 --> 44:59.378
Oh yeah.

44:59.406 --> 45:00.503
– Really?
– Sure.

45:00.673 --> 45:02.155
– How would you do it?
– Wood chipper.

45:02.180 --> 45:03.646
– A wood chipper?
– Yeah.

45:03.827 --> 45:05.373
– A wood chipper!
– Yeah.

45:05.842 --> 45:07.378
– Wow.
– I know.

45:07.452 --> 45:08.503
Did you see Fargo?

45:08.574 --> 45:09.548
Yeah.

45:12.587 --> 45:15.491
That’s a bad plan, the cupcakes
is a way better plan.

45:15.506 --> 45:16.847
It is. You’re right.

45:16.875 --> 45:18.628
You know what? I won’t murder you.

45:20.995 --> 45:22.167
I love you.

45:22.212 --> 45:23.332
I love you too…

45:24.451 --> 45:25.701
You know what I brought?
– What?

45:25.715 --> 45:28.284
A medical marijuana cookie.
Ben gave it to me last Christmas.

45:28.300 --> 45:29.823
– What?
– Yeah. I brought it.

45:29.992 --> 45:31.599
– You did?
– Chocolate chip koo-kie.

45:31.627 --> 45:32.418
Should we do it?

45:32.429 --> 45:35.840
Let’s eat the cookie, and then we’ll order
a bunch of cheeseburgers and a bunch of-

45:35.879 --> 45:37.645
Let’s order the entire room service menu.

45:37.654 --> 45:41.212
Just get all of it.
You deserve it. You really do.

45:41.227 --> 45:43.074
Wouldn’t you rather have me
around for less years

45:43.083 --> 45:46.144
and I’m incredibly happy
than longer and miserable?

45:46.185 --> 45:48.846
Yes, and I just realized that right now.

45:48.865 --> 45:49.768
Go get the cookie!

45:49.776 --> 45:51.519
– I’ll get the cookie!
– Go get the cookie!

45:53.010 --> 45:55.237
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

45:55.582 --> 45:57.532
Yeah. Should we get a block of porn?

45:57.630 --> 45:59.814
I don’t think we need
twenty-four hours of porn.

45:59.845 --> 46:03.522
Yeah, but you know, like two porns cost
just about as much as a 24-hour block.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.405
I think that’s too much porn.

46:05.471 --> 46:08.109
We don’t have to watch it all,
but for the value it makes sense.

46:09.752 --> 46:11.086
How much are we supposed to eat?

46:11.109 --> 46:13.497
I don’t know. I think like
six or seven cookies, right?

46:13.569 --> 46:16.090
Plus, it’s old. It probably
has lost some of its-

46:16.113 --> 46:17.183
– Potency?
– Mm-hmm.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.320
No.

46:19.983 --> 46:22.121
We should have sex. More.

46:22.150 --> 46:24.194
I mean, girls have it so easy.

46:24.204 --> 46:27.858
You just show up with your sexual
organs and you’re good to go.

46:27.959 --> 46:29.217
All the pressure is on the guy.

46:29.235 --> 46:30.108
It’s true.

46:30.130 --> 46:34.588
And I look at guys, like… I look at
a guy like Prince, and you know that guy

46:34.589 --> 46:35.519
fucks.
– Yeah.

46:35.534 --> 46:37.984
I know I don’t fuck like Prince.

46:38.100 --> 46:40.984
Prince can fuck.
I fuck more like David Schwimmer.

46:43.507 --> 46:44.304
You do.

46:45.606 --> 46:48.924
I fuck- you know, like Ross from Friends.

47:00.556 --> 47:01.553
That’s good.

47:01.583 --> 47:02.691
How does he do it?

47:04.067 --> 47:05.916
The floating spoon.

47:07.279 --> 47:09.292
Check it out. My dick and balls.

47:09.751 --> 47:12.326
Oh my God! I’m gonna eat my own dick!

47:13.128 --> 47:14.506
I ate my dick!

47:15.406 --> 47:17.880
Kelly, I think this room has rodents.

47:19.176 --> 47:20.536
I just saw it!

47:20.895 --> 47:22.361
Have you seen my starfish?

47:23.047 --> 47:24.653
Where did I put my starfish?

47:26.627 --> 47:27.548
Hmm my God.

47:27.557 --> 47:29.957
I’m gonna deep throat this éclair.

47:31.306 --> 47:33.092
I wanna make out with you so bad.

48:11.717 --> 48:13.959
– Τhаt wаѕ nісе.
– Τhаt wаѕ nісе.

48:17.524 --> 48:21.592
Mom! Charlotte’s crying.
She’s got an ear infection again.

48:21.853 --> 48:23.653
I didn’t know what to do.

48:26.216 --> 48:27.354
We’re home.

48:27.447 --> 48:28.679
Are you okay?

48:29.148 --> 48:30.476
What’s the matter?

48:30.722 --> 48:34.891
I wanna rip my ear off,
it hurts so much.

48:35.066 --> 48:38.483
I told you the pediatrician
didn’t know what he was talking about.

48:38.490 --> 48:40.351
Oh, come on. You can’t
blame it on our doctor.

48:40.369 --> 48:42.234
Ear infections are common in little kids.

48:42.272 --> 48:44.600
Not in kids over six years old.

48:44.665 --> 48:46.944
We’re going to the Eastern doctor.

48:47.035 --> 48:49.561
If she’s in this much pain,
we should call a real doctor.

48:50.527 --> 48:52.048
Are you kidding right now?

48:54.273 --> 48:56.130
Alright, okay. Yeah.

48:57.215 --> 48:59.533
What we should do is easy and simple.

48:59.771 --> 49:02.501
No more dairy, no more
wheat, no more sugar.

49:02.546 --> 49:04.770
Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay.

49:04.822 --> 49:06.171
What the fuck is left?

49:06.380 --> 49:07.335
Sorry.

49:08.144 --> 49:10.273
Isn’t everything sugar, wheat and dairy?

49:10.375 --> 49:12.455
She can have
vegetables and f-r-ruits.

49:12.601 --> 49:14.130
So- oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits.

49:14.237 --> 49:15.278
Fr-r-ruits, yeah.

49:15.388 --> 49:17.188
Uhm, any kind of fr-r-ruits?

49:17.250 --> 49:18.635
Mangos, pineapple…

49:18.650 --> 49:21.549
It isn’t like there are safe fr-rruits
and then unsafe fr-r-ruits.

49:21.605 --> 49:22.337
No, no.

49:22.391 --> 49:24.657
What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries?
Can we do something like that?

49:24.688 --> 49:26.891
Are you okay? Would
you like to come on the table?

49:26.923 --> 49:27.694
I’m okay. I’m-

49:27.717 --> 49:28.936
– Why don’t you go on the table?
– I don’t wanna-

49:28.960 --> 49:29.949
Why don’t you go on the table?

49:29.960 --> 49:31.347
Now it looks like you
need to get on the table.

49:31.356 --> 49:32.512
I don’t wanna get on the table.

49:40.568 --> 49:41.768
Pete!

49:49.520 --> 49:50.631
What are you doing?

49:50.757 --> 49:53.442
I need you to look at something.
In my butt.

49:56.484 --> 49:57.380
Why?

49:57.457 --> 50:01.544
I think I’ve got something in there,
and I’m not limber enough to…

50:01.793 --> 50:04.236
to see. I need you to look at it.

50:04.719 --> 50:07.763
See, I might have like an anal fissure
or a hemorrhoid or a-

50:07.803 --> 50:09.419
or a worm or something.

50:11.725 --> 50:13.134
What are you doing with your phone?

50:13.281 --> 50:16.881
Trying to take pictures of it, so I
can compare it to something on Google.

50:17.741 --> 50:22.592
Can we just keep like a
small shred of mystery

50:22.965 --> 50:25.195
in our relationship, please?

50:25.277 --> 50:27.384
Look, I saw you have two babies, okay?

50:27.415 --> 50:29.180
Seriously, I need you
to get all up in that.

50:29.202 --> 50:31.777
I do not want to investigate your anus.

50:32.188 --> 50:33.748
It’s payback time.

50:42.372 --> 50:43.754
It’s a hemorrhoid.

50:44.451 --> 50:45.815
Thank you.

50:45.980 --> 50:47.887
Now erase that from your memory.

50:53.419 --> 50:57.011
Where did she get those clothes?
That’s very expensive clothes.

50:57.372 --> 50:59.846
Think. Where do you think?

51:04.190 --> 51:06.562
I don’t want this to sound harsh, but…

51:06.677 --> 51:08.637
everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie.

51:08.724 --> 51:10.909
Everything that comes into it is a dick.

51:11.176 --> 51:13.576
Everything that goes in is dicks?

51:13.669 --> 51:14.587
A dick.

51:14.706 --> 51:15.860
Don’t say that.

51:15.914 --> 51:18.914
I’m sorry, I’m just being
protective of the store.

51:19.193 --> 51:20.927
I’m gonna go talk to her.

51:26.913 --> 51:28.069
Hey Desi.

51:28.169 --> 51:29.569
– Hi.
– Hi.

51:29.687 --> 51:31.699
Is that your new Acura out front?

51:31.850 --> 51:32.933
Uh, yeah.

51:33.066 --> 51:35.466
So nice. Do you love it?

51:35.654 --> 51:38.654
Well, I mean, it’s not a fucking Porsche,
but it’ll do for now.

51:40.896 --> 51:44.262
Hey Desi, would you mind wearing some
of the clothes that we have in the store?

51:44.278 --> 51:46.603
Yes. Yeah, I’m sorry.

51:46.630 --> 51:47.940
– Would that be okay?
– Yeah.

51:50.924 --> 51:52.744
– Perfect.
– Good.

51:54.241 --> 51:56.641
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

51:56.799 --> 51:58.091
– Did you?
– Yeah.

51:58.187 --> 52:00.981
The tiger, I did it on a piece
of paper separately,

52:01.022 --> 52:04.098
and then I actually
transferred it to the t-shirt.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.200
Wow.

52:05.323 --> 52:08.384
So you- you stenciled on the tiger?

52:08.568 --> 52:13.401
I drew it on a piece of paper, and then
I transferred the drawing to the t-shirt.

52:13.524 --> 52:15.808
You have an amazing body.

52:15.856 --> 52:17.935
– Really?
– Yes.

52:18.196 --> 52:19.996
Are those real?

52:20.170 --> 52:21.800
– My boobs?
– Yeah.

52:22.192 --> 52:24.519
Yeah…
Do you want to touch them?

52:24.855 --> 52:26.433
– Really?
– Touch ‘em!

52:27.160 --> 52:28.337
Okay.

52:32.009 --> 52:33.129
Wow.

52:34.350 --> 52:35.342
Huh!

52:35.623 --> 52:36.743
Jesus.

52:38.091 --> 52:40.753
I mean they really are amazing.

52:41.053 --> 52:42.910
That’s firm, for real.

52:43.387 --> 52:45.728
They’re like a memory mattress.

52:46.201 --> 52:49.886
It’s- Wow. Like Tempurpedic, you know?

52:49.956 --> 52:51.667
They look amazing.

52:51.902 --> 52:54.496
My kids just sucked the meat
right out of mine.

52:54.590 --> 52:55.652
– No…
– Yeah.

52:55.660 --> 52:56.894
There’s some meat in there.

52:56.912 --> 53:00.714
My boobs are just gone. Since
I had kids, my boobs are just gone.

53:01.016 --> 53:04.131
They didn’t even say goodbye.
You know, they just left.

53:04.276 --> 53:07.876
By the time I’m forty, these are
gonna go National Geographic on me.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.680
I feel bad about myself right now.

53:12.049 --> 53:14.851
I think this is a
really good offer on the house.

53:14.880 --> 53:16.698
We expected more. I mean,

53:16.715 --> 53:20.010
I know it’s a bad market but that’s still
way what under we were looking for.

53:20.031 --> 53:23.794
I know, but based on the market,
it’s like you’re gaining money.

53:23.835 --> 53:26.215
Because it’s so much more
than what you deserve.

53:26.479 --> 53:27.738
But these people are from Iran,

53:27.750 --> 53:30.316
and they don’t really know that
they’re offering too much.

53:30.340 --> 53:33.183
Is there any chance
that Debbie will go for it?

53:33.291 --> 53:35.091
I doubt it. I mean, I don’t know, I-

53:35.116 --> 53:37.030
There’s a lot of inventory out there.

53:37.101 --> 53:38.255
I mean, what’s her problem?

53:38.289 --> 53:42.185
She… she has unrealistic expectations.

53:46.580 --> 53:49.986
Hey! Did you miss me Travis?

53:50.809 --> 53:52.369
It’s Jack!

53:52.619 --> 53:53.914
Hey, Jack.

53:53.960 --> 53:56.129
My daddy doesn’t know my name.

53:56.145 --> 53:57.332
– Ok, come on, let’s go.
– Can I go show

53:57.344 --> 54:00.119
my crystals before they leave?

54:00.188 --> 54:01.061
Yeah, really quick.

54:01.085 --> 54:03.311
It’s alright with me!
Hang up with your dad!

54:03.382 --> 54:04.502
Okay!

54:04.664 --> 54:06.888
Go play with your tiny uncles.

54:06.912 --> 54:08.732
– Let’s play murder.
– Yeah. Let’s go.

54:08.849 --> 54:10.597
So what are you doing, spring cleaning?

54:10.625 --> 54:15.566
I’m getting rid of everything
in the house that has gluten or sugar.

54:15.779 --> 54:17.183
Why? What’s wrong with gluten?

54:17.281 --> 54:18.777
Gluten’s really bad for you.

54:18.876 --> 54:20.222
I don’t think so. It’s wheat.

54:20.301 --> 54:21.746
Don’t you watch Dr. Oz?

54:21.796 --> 54:23.340
As in the Wizard of?

54:23.486 --> 54:26.770
Hey, Mom. We were wondering if
we could use the computer to iChat.

54:26.927 --> 54:29.027
Remember the rules. 8 to 8:30?

54:29.314 --> 54:31.171
Yeah, but I have a friend over.

54:31.355 --> 54:33.811
Hi Wendy.
Yeah. I know. Uh…

54:33.871 --> 54:36.335
Why don’t you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

54:36.390 --> 54:37.778
Yeah, remember the Alamo?

54:37.838 --> 54:39.270
Have you ever built a fort, Wendy?

54:39.379 --> 54:40.939
Like on Facebook?

54:41.153 --> 54:43.142
I will take this if you’re
gonna throw it away,

54:43.166 --> 54:46.422
because at our house, we’re wheat eaters.

54:46.554 --> 54:49.379
But don’t you want to live long
enough to see your kids grow up?

54:49.445 --> 54:50.845
That’s up to God, honey.

54:50.876 --> 54:52.645
Yeah but that’s really
not good for the kids.

54:52.661 --> 54:55.322
Eh! The kids eat grass. This is fine.

54:55.367 --> 54:58.150
Wendy’s mom lets her go on
whenever she wants.

54:58.382 --> 55:01.864
Yeah. My mom’s pretty cool about
it as long as I finish my homework.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.210
Yeah…

55:03.364 --> 55:06.058
Well, I guess I’m not the cool one. But…

55:06.230 --> 55:08.183
the rules are just in our different house.

55:08.306 --> 55:10.335
Well, I get better grades than Wendy.

55:10.417 --> 55:12.460
She does. She’s so smart.

55:12.521 --> 55:14.553
Let me just grab the candy worms.

55:14.578 --> 55:16.159
Your rules are ridiculous.

55:16.222 --> 55:17.296
Don’t sass me.

55:17.327 --> 55:19.137
I’m only sassing you
because you’re throwing out

55:19.138 --> 55:22.028
all the food in our house
and I’m freaking starving.

55:22.263 --> 55:23.504
You’re being stupid.

55:23.637 --> 55:25.453
Wendy, can you go stand
in the other room, please?

55:25.482 --> 55:26.862
– Yeah.
– Mom.

55:26.956 --> 55:28.034
Give me your iPhone now.

55:28.060 --> 55:29.860
The nougat things are good.

55:30.370 --> 55:31.667
I have all my contacts in there.

55:31.683 --> 55:33.368
Okay, if you don’t give me
your phone right now,

55:33.377 --> 55:35.758
then I’m gonna have to take away
your phone and your computer.

55:35.782 --> 55:36.751
– Jesus Christ, I need
– That’s it.

55:36.752 --> 55:39.152
– my computer to do homework.
– That’s it.

55:39.197 --> 55:40.169
No phone, no computer.

55:40.186 --> 55:44.113
This is B.S. This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You’re acting like a B.

55:44.155 --> 55:46.168
Kids! Time to go!

55:46.246 --> 55:48.124
You go to your room right now,

55:48.167 --> 55:53.399
you are not allowed to use iPhone,
iPad, iPod Touch, iTunes,

55:53.415 --> 55:56.225
Netflix, Pandora, or Spotify!

55:56.491 --> 55:59.629
She’s a little pip.
Just like her mommy.

56:00.629 --> 56:04.348
So uh, I might have a job tomorrow.

56:04.373 --> 56:06.761
at least I’m gonna go
try to give an estimate.,

56:06.849 --> 56:09.128
Do you mind taking
the kids for a couple hours?

56:09.332 --> 56:10.452
Uhm…

56:11.129 --> 56:12.329
Okay.

56:12.820 --> 56:14.435
This is nice.

56:14.521 --> 56:16.942
You and I don’t spend
enough time together, do we?

56:17.329 --> 56:19.044
We spend enough time together.

56:19.208 --> 56:20.080
We do?

56:20.385 --> 56:22.185
It’s quality time.

56:24.419 --> 56:25.604
Then we do.

56:26.340 --> 56:27.924
I’ll go with what you think.

56:28.498 --> 56:30.298
What else did they say?

56:30.713 --> 56:32.546
Alright, some kid named Joseph--

56:32.560 --> 56:33.310
I know Joseph.

56:33.357 --> 56:34.466
– You do?
– Mm-hmm.

56:34.501 --> 56:36.323
He’s making a “Hot or Not” list.

56:36.346 --> 56:37.401
What?

56:37.430 --> 56:39.888
So, Sadie said, “That’s so lame
and immature that you’re doing that.”

56:39.904 --> 56:42.464
And then Joseph says, “Yo, girl,

56:42.646 --> 56:45.987
We’re just having some
fun so don’t be a bitch, yo.”

56:46.395 --> 56:47.819
That is not nice.

56:48.483 --> 56:50.465
So then Sadie said,
“Don’t call me a bitch.”

56:50.490 --> 56:53.714
And Joseph said, “I didn’t call you
a bitch, I said don’t act like a bitch.

56:53.749 --> 56:55.949
And by the way you’re
in the ‘Not Hot’ column”.

56:56.365 --> 56:58.348
Who made him the judge of hot?

56:58.521 --> 57:00.690
Do you realize what that
could do to her self-esteem?

57:00.817 --> 57:03.182
What a little fuckhead.
I’ll kill him.

57:03.214 --> 57:05.461
So then Sadie said, “You’re
in the jackass column.

57:05.547 --> 57:07.321
I’ve got to go. I’m bored of you.”

57:07.797 --> 57:10.901
That is cool.
That’s taking the high road.

57:11.213 --> 57:15.243
For some reason, there’s an
emoticon of a panda doing push-ups.

57:16.370 --> 57:17.875
I wonder what that means.

57:18.301 --> 57:21.213
I don’t think it means anything,
I think it’s just adorable.

57:21.339 --> 57:22.479
Aww.

57:22.560 --> 57:26.815
She’s a good girl. She was polite,
and she stood up for herself.

57:26.957 --> 57:28.135
That’s pretty cool.

57:30.074 --> 57:31.501
– Shit!
– What?

57:31.617 --> 57:32.833
I thought she was coming in.

57:32.909 --> 57:34.695
Oh my God, that scared me to death.

57:34.817 --> 57:36.455
If she caught us, she would kill us.

57:36.495 --> 57:38.133
She would, she would kill us.

57:46.112 --> 57:47.680
I’ve got to make a call.

57:50.368 --> 57:51.328
We sold how many?

57:51.421 --> 57:54.707
Six hundred and twelve album downloads.

57:54.938 --> 57:57.285
Wait a minute. There
are no zeros after that?

57:57.352 --> 58:00.826
No, there are zeros, but all of
them are before six hundred and twelve.

58:00.873 --> 58:02.370
There are none after.

58:02.510 --> 58:03.933
How is that even possible?

58:03.967 --> 58:06.222
Well, out of three hundred million
Americans,

58:06.270 --> 58:10.080
six hundred and twelve people
chose to download the album.

58:10.481 --> 58:13.385
You could personally call everyone
who bought this record.

58:13.760 --> 58:15.835
We’re fucked! We’re fucked!

58:16.407 --> 58:19.062
Here’s the deal. I want you to meet me
tomorrow morning at eight o’clock.

58:19.088 --> 58:22.390
I want a list of at least thirty ideas
of what we can do to change this.

58:22.494 --> 58:24.077
We have to change this.

58:24.166 --> 58:26.577
I started a record label
because I couldn’t get a job,

58:26.590 --> 58:28.476
so I have no other options.

58:48.295 --> 58:49.449
What financial problems?

58:49.509 --> 58:51.386
Well, I mean, for one thing
you were right,

58:51.408 --> 58:54.066
I mean, you are missing about ten
thousand dollars…

58:54.136 --> 58:57.556
from the store. And then, Pete’s record,
you know, not selling…

58:57.638 --> 58:58.862
– Pete’s record not selling,
– .. well.

58:58.898 --> 59:01.409
I thought we weren’t
supposed to hear for three weeks?

59:01.437 --> 59:02.551
– We heard.
– You heard?

59:02.630 --> 59:03.911
And they’re bad.

59:04.020 --> 59:06.419
You know, it’s that, and it’s the money
that he’s been lending to his father,

59:06.441 --> 59:08.044
That’s creating a strain.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.000
How- how much have we…

59:10.400 --> 59:11.546
How much have we…

59:11.554 --> 59:12.725
– lent him?
– Eighty thousand.

59:12.807 --> 59:16.679
Did you say “eight
thousand” or “eighty thousand”?

59:16.812 --> 59:19.612
Eighty thousand,
over the past couple of years.

59:19.773 --> 59:21.651
And then you missed the mortgage payment,

59:21.667 --> 59:22.591
– and-
– On the house?

59:22.640 --> 59:26.387
And- Oh, and uh, uh you missed
the rental… on the office.

59:26.905 --> 59:28.254
Does Pete know that?

59:28.341 --> 59:30.518
Oh, yeah. We’re on the
phone all the time.

59:30.927 --> 59:33.127
Look, I know you’re going
through a hard time,

59:33.264 --> 59:35.971
and I want you guys to know that
we’re here for you.

59:36.341 --> 59:39.094
Okay? Anything you guys need,
that’s why we’re here.

59:39.098 --> 59:41.008
We’re here for times like this.

59:41.342 --> 59:42.570
What are you gonna do?

59:42.743 --> 59:44.297
There’s not much I can do.

59:55.239 --> 59:56.424
What are you doing?

59:56.563 --> 59:59.815
Uh, I’m drawing the album
cover for Van Halen’s Diver Down.

59:59.901 --> 01:00:02.672
If you spent a little bit more time
focusing on Graham Parker

01:00:02.681 --> 01:00:06.015
instead of drawing album covers,
I wouldn’t be in this predicament.

01:00:06.093 --> 01:00:07.902
I’m focused on Graham Parker.

01:00:07.939 --> 01:00:09.764
You’re supposed to help me with him!

01:00:09.845 --> 01:00:11.944
You’re supposed to call the
companies, you’re supposed to-

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:13.811
you’re supposed to get
people to the show!

01:00:13.898 --> 01:00:17.466
I’ve done everything I can, Pete.
You had me pushing around a corpse!

01:00:17.601 --> 01:00:19.919
It was like being in fucking
Weekend at Graham’s.

01:00:19.951 --> 01:00:21.659
What should we do?
I’m out of ideas.

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:23.112
You fly in The Rumour.

01:00:23.474 --> 01:00:27.941
I can’t sell a reunion concert
without the band, it’s ridiculous.

01:00:28.152 --> 01:00:30.051
With what? I can’t afford it.

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:32.798
You put this on yourself.
You wanted the responsibility,

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:35.415
take it on the fucking chin,
and stop acting like a bitch.

01:00:35.474 --> 01:00:36.995
What did you call me?

01:00:37.172 --> 01:00:38.120
Chin.

01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:40.378
Pete!

01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:41.768
Wait! Wait, Pete!

01:00:42.378 --> 01:00:44.618
Hey, I have an apartment,
I have health insurance,

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.118
I have car payments,
I have responsibilities.

01:00:47.188 --> 01:00:49.920
You have responsibili- don’t talk
to me about responsibilities.

01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:52.381
I have a life, I have- I have a family.

01:00:52.558 --> 01:00:55.446
I can’t afford to sit in my apartment
getting high, jerking off,

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.460
and then goin’ to the Tommy’s Chili
Burgers at three in the morning.

01:00:58.538 --> 01:01:01.059
That’s not even the order that happens in!

01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:03.785
I have everything to lose here.
Everything.

01:01:03.902 --> 01:01:07.605
Yes! Because you spent thousands
of dollars on shit we don’t need.

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:12.096
You really need to spend thirty thousand
dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude?

01:01:12.153 --> 01:01:15.971
Which is inside! It’s not even outside.
We know where we work!

01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:19.062
If you want to sign a band, you
have to look like you’re the real deal.

01:01:19.095 --> 01:01:22.095
Princess Labia, how much is it
to fucking fly The Rumour in?

01:01:22.691 --> 01:01:24.934
– It’s twelve thousand.
– Twelve thousand dollars!

01:01:25.153 --> 01:01:26.432
Alright, you know what? Fine.

01:01:26.761 --> 01:01:29.477
Fly in The Rumour. Put it on my AmEx.

01:01:31.966 --> 01:01:33.864
No, you said it was impossible.

01:01:34.201 --> 01:01:36.419
I don’t think I said impossible.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:37.184
Yeah.

01:01:37.306 --> 01:01:40.292
I usually don’t say impossible.
I like to-

01:01:40.556 --> 01:01:42.356
I like to leave some wiggle room.

01:01:42.406 --> 01:01:46.161
You said that…
my fibroid was like

01:01:46.406 --> 01:01:48.778
a giant boulder like the one from the

01:01:48.786 --> 01:01:49.997
– Indiana Jones.
– Indiana Jones

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:52.190
movies blocking up my uterus.

01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:53.314
movies blocking up my uterus.
– uterus.

01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:57.289
And I need to stop
using that reference of Indiana Jones.

01:01:57.332 --> 01:02:02.343
I think that’s not appropriate when
talking about the reproductive system.

01:02:02.392 --> 01:02:03.460
It’s okay.

01:02:03.538 --> 01:02:06.504
Anyway, somehow the
Eastern medicine has worked,

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:09.645
and the fibroid has dissipated.

01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:12.391
– That’s great!
– Yes!

01:02:12.486 --> 01:02:13.392
Wow!

01:02:13.407 --> 01:02:16.482
Yes. Your fibroid shrunk, and somehow…

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.311
it allowed you to get pregnant.

01:02:23.659 --> 01:02:24.859
What?

01:02:25.905 --> 01:02:28.228
You’re gonna have your third baby.

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:30.230
Congratulations.

01:02:33.153 --> 01:02:34.353
No.

01:02:34.979 --> 01:02:37.379
Yes.

01:02:41.811 --> 01:02:43.654
Would you like some water?

01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:46.646
That’s good news.

01:02:47.795 --> 01:02:50.482
Another baby… at forty.

01:02:51.046 --> 01:02:52.254
Debbie?

01:02:52.729 --> 01:02:54.703
I am thrilled.

01:02:57.135 --> 01:03:00.187
And Pete is gonna be so happy.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.031
So, you’re okay?

01:03:05.008 --> 01:03:06.209
What a relief.

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:09.620
I can finally relax now, you know?

01:03:10.237 --> 01:03:11.357
I spent like…

01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:19.184
It’s okay.

01:03:21.325 --> 01:03:23.104
I’m so happy, you know,

01:03:23.201 --> 01:03:25.314
I really am. Cause… I mean…

01:03:25.994 --> 01:03:27.114
It’s good.

01:03:28.101 --> 01:03:30.734
Great. Great.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.444
– Hey!
– Hey!

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.317
Why are you in a bathrobe?
It’s the middle of the afternoon.

01:04:25.353 --> 01:04:28.353
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

01:04:28.791 --> 01:04:30.531
Look, I’m sorry about the record.

01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:34.835
You’re going through financial shit.
This is- this is what I live with.

01:04:34.945 --> 01:04:37.945
This is a horrible time
in human history. What is that?

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.578
Something that might help
both of our situations.

01:04:41.242 --> 01:04:44.763
This… is a drawing… by John Lennon.

01:04:45.003 --> 01:04:47.305
I got it ten years ago
for five thousand dollars.

01:04:47.381 --> 01:04:50.313
I don’t know how much it’s worth now.
Could be five, could be twenty.

01:04:50.665 --> 01:04:52.834
I don’t want this.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.967
I don’t even like it.
I’m not gonna hang it up.

01:04:55.037 --> 01:04:57.420
It’s not for you to hang up.
It’s for you to sell.

01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:59.823
That way I can give it to you
and you can make some money,

01:04:59.824 --> 01:05:01.761
and Debbie won’t know
that I’m giving you anything.

01:05:01.777 --> 01:05:04.777
Well, you’re not giving me money.
You’re giving me a project.

01:05:04.855 --> 01:05:07.635
I don’t know how to sell this.
I’m not an art dealer.

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:10.028
Sell it online.

01:05:10.242 --> 01:05:12.895
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

01:05:12.963 --> 01:05:15.304
Or is that too hard to do
with your high blood pressure?

01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.625
All right. Don’t get snippy.

01:05:18.108 --> 01:05:21.108
Just because you write a great song
doesn’t mean you can draw.

01:05:21.445 --> 01:05:23.903
It’s incredible, Le-
John Lennon drew it.

01:05:24.308 --> 01:05:25.805
I think it’s a Ringo.

01:05:26.176 --> 01:05:28.594
Don’t beat me up if I get
three hundred dollars for it.

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:31.202
Don’t take less than
sixty-five hundred for that.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.139
It’s very valuable.
It’s important to me.

01:05:33.143 --> 01:05:34.920
I want you to sell it so I can help you.

01:05:35.141 --> 01:05:35.983
Okay.

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:38.166
Alright. I’ll see you at my party.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.285
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

01:05:41.364 --> 01:05:42.184
No.

01:05:42.345 --> 01:05:44.959
Don’t buy wine with my money
and give it to me at my party.

01:05:45.033 --> 01:05:46.365
– That’s mean.
– I love you.

01:05:46.445 --> 01:05:47.380
– Alright.
– Bye.

01:05:48.107 --> 01:05:50.507
How do I call eBay?

01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:54.417
Minnie called me of bitch,
what am I supposed to say?

01:05:57.473 --> 01:05:59.564
But I think maybe
that might mean he likes me,

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:03.179
I don’t know, can you believe he-
It’s really awkward.

01:06:04.179 --> 01:06:05.429
I think he might like you.

01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:10.758
She’s so cute. She’s so tall.

01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:13.312
I know. How did that happen?

01:06:16.152 --> 01:06:18.552
Do you ever wish
we had a bigger family?

01:06:18.614 --> 01:06:20.395
No, never for a second.

01:06:22.325 --> 01:06:23.236
Never.

01:06:23.534 --> 01:06:24.654
– Never. Never.
– Never?

01:06:25.377 --> 01:06:27.000
I love what we have.

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:30.305
One? A breeze. Two? Brutal.

01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:32.594
Three? Put a bullet in my head.

01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:37.303
You know, I think about that gray-haired
pregnant lady from school

01:06:37.313 --> 01:06:39.164
and I just feel bad for her.

01:06:39.392 --> 01:06:41.186
And I feel bad for the kid.

01:06:41.969 --> 01:06:43.217
Can you imagine?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.629
All the other little kids, “Where’s your
mommy?”

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:50.061
“Oh, she’s the one sitting in
that scooter eating a soft cracker.”

01:06:50.226 --> 01:06:52.179
Kids don’t want to have old parents.

01:06:52.764 --> 01:06:55.855
You know, it would also be nice for us
to spend some time apart.

01:06:55.998 --> 01:06:58.831
Kind of rediscover who
we are individually.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:01.348
It would be so great to not
see you for like a chunk of time

01:07:01.357 --> 01:07:03.520
so that I could really just miss you.

01:07:04.334 --> 01:07:06.134
Remember when we used to miss each other?

01:07:17.272 --> 01:07:19.191
Hey!
Hey, you!

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.933
Yo, sup?

01:07:21.149 --> 01:07:22.709
Hey, I’m Sadie’s mom.

01:07:24.315 --> 01:07:25.096
Sadie…?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.203
Sadie, the one you chat
with on the internet?

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:28.372
Nah, man. That ain’t me.

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:30.354
Well, it was you, I saw your picture.

01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:34.635
Did you make a “Hot” list,
and not on put Sadie the “Hot” list?

01:07:34.774 --> 01:07:36.292
She was not on my list, no.

01:07:36.307 --> 01:07:38.984
You know what I’m gonna do?
I’m gonna make my own “Hot” list.

01:07:39.034 --> 01:07:42.211
And you know what?
You’re on the “Not Hot” list.

01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:43.586
How does that feel?

01:07:43.783 --> 01:07:45.894
It doesn’t bother me. I’m
comfortable with the way I am.

01:07:46.113 --> 01:07:49.493
Maybe you shouldn’t be so comfortable
with yourself. You know why?

01:07:50.042 --> 01:07:52.548
You look like a miniature Tom Petty.

01:07:52.848 --> 01:07:54.171
How’s that feel? Huh?

01:07:54.261 --> 01:07:56.336
You think that haircut’s cool? It’s not.

01:07:56.393 --> 01:07:59.383
It looks like you put your
Justin Bieber wig on backwards.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:00.969
You still comfortable with yourself?

01:08:01.438 --> 01:08:03.309
Why are you wearing a tank top? Huh?

01:08:03.473 --> 01:08:07.512
So you can show off your bald pits,
you little hairless wonder?

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:10.052
Cool tank top, man. Huh?

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:14.982
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

01:08:15.005 --> 01:08:18.260
on my daughter’s Facebook page,
just remember me.

01:08:18.412 --> 01:08:19.691
Remember me.

01:08:19.991 --> 01:08:23.667
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

01:08:24.299 --> 01:08:25.151
Okay, I’m sorry.

01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:26.901
Wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey!

01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:29.250
Well, you don’t- are you crying?

01:08:29.294 --> 01:08:30.242
Just let me go.

01:08:30.438 --> 01:08:32.091
Oh my… But you…

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:34.326
I’m sorry.
– It’s okay.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.350
I’m de- I’m sorry.

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:38.390
I’m not in my right head.

01:08:38.537 --> 01:08:42.511
I understand. My mom is going
through menopause, too. It’s a hard time.

01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:44.573
What did you say?

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.591
You’re going through menopause?

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:47.615
I’m not going through menopause!

01:08:47.638 --> 01:08:50.323
I’m not gonna go through
menopause for like twenty years.

01:08:51.299 --> 01:08:54.683
I’m pregnant you little bitch.
God damn it!

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.312
God damn it!

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.506
I’m going out with Desi to find out
if she’s stealing from us.

01:09:04.531 --> 01:09:06.841
I’ve got the Graham Parker concert.
Who’s gonna watch the kids?

01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:08.255
I don’t know. Figure it out.

01:09:14.892 --> 01:09:16.608
I kinda just wanted to talk.

01:09:16.643 --> 01:09:20.567
I thought maybe we could go to
a coffee house or something?

01:09:20.671 --> 01:09:22.442
Oh, you want coffee?

01:09:22.465 --> 01:09:24.822
This place has coffee,
they have all kinds of drinks.

01:09:25.955 --> 01:09:29.225
Uhm… better some place quiet, maybe?

01:09:29.952 --> 01:09:33.660
This place can be quiet. The seats
there on the back are pretty quiet.

01:09:34.895 --> 01:09:36.696
What sport do you guys play?

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:38.182
Uh, we play hockey.

01:09:38.298 --> 01:09:39.694
Oh, I like hockey.

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:40.738
Who do you guys play for?

01:09:40.783 --> 01:09:42.874
We play for the Philadelphia Flyers.

01:09:42.992 --> 01:09:44.763
So you guys are all from Philadelphia?

01:09:44.787 --> 01:09:46.358
No. No.

01:09:46.366 --> 01:09:47.691
Actually none of us are.

01:09:47.736 --> 01:09:49.902
Do you guys still
have all of your teeth?

01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:52.259
Well, I’ve got all my teeth, except…

01:09:53.102 --> 01:09:54.154
These ones.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.490
You wanna try them on?

01:09:55.514 --> 01:09:56.990
Yeah, I’ll do it.

01:10:01.139 --> 01:10:02.105
Do I look sexy?

01:10:02.152 --> 01:10:03.832
Yeah!

01:10:13.806 --> 01:10:16.499
They definitely look way better
on her than they do on you.

01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:20.073
– Thank you.
– Very cute.

01:10:20.295 --> 01:10:23.292
So, should we go to the quiet area?

01:10:23.477 --> 01:10:26.206
No no no, no, no…

01:10:26.216 --> 01:10:27.026
Where are you going?

01:10:27.052 --> 01:10:29.674
We kind of have to have a
little business meeting tonight.

01:10:29.733 --> 01:10:32.293
Business meeting? Business girls, you have
to celebrate. We won tonight. Let’s go.

01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:33.788
I want to party with these winners,

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:34.618
come on Deb!
– Yeah!

01:10:34.635 --> 01:10:37.035
Just come and stay, just dance with us.

01:10:37.328 --> 01:10:39.122
– Okay.
– Yeah!

01:10:39.496 --> 01:10:41.614
Okay, let’s fucking dance!

01:10:46.774 --> 01:10:50.470
Don’t be shy, feel free to come down,
and fill up these empty seats.

01:10:50.688 --> 01:10:53.303
Thank you so much for coming,
this is so exciting!

01:10:54.352 --> 01:10:58.131
For the first time in over thirty years,

01:10:58.362 --> 01:11:00.576
Graham Parker and The Rumour.

01:11:41.724 --> 01:11:44.323
Where are his fans?
I mean, where are they?

01:11:44.453 --> 01:11:46.274
It’s hard to watch a band…

01:11:47.048 --> 01:11:50.059
when you know all of them
remember D-Day.

01:11:56.142 --> 01:11:57.726
Well, what’s press turnout like?

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.912
Are you serious?

01:12:01.015 --> 01:12:03.237
Nobody came!
Nobody.

01:12:03.483 --> 01:12:04.949
Nobody is here?

01:12:05.012 --> 01:12:06.848
Oh, the guy from Green Day is here.

01:12:06.935 --> 01:12:09.182
Yeah, Billie Joe, I emailed him.
He’s a fan.

01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:10.964
You’ve got to get a photo
of the two of them.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.362
No, he says he doesn’t want to do
any press, he’s just watching the show.

01:12:14.456 --> 01:12:16.086
Oh, how punk rock of him.

01:12:16.196 --> 01:12:18.545
“I don’t like- I don’t like photographs.”

01:12:19.624 --> 01:12:20.996
Grow up, Green Day!

01:12:21.072 --> 01:12:22.973
Shut the fuck up, Tom Selleck.

01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:04.744
You don’t have like- yeah, I wouldn’t
call them classically  good…

01:13:05.526 --> 01:13:08.547
dance moves, but you
left it all out there.

01:13:08.574 --> 01:13:10.383
It’s- you’re a blast to dance with.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.598
Thank you.

01:13:11.693 --> 01:13:14.643
We’re having a little- a little
shindig at the hotel after this,

01:13:14.646 --> 01:13:16.393
you should come by and, uh…

01:13:16.494 --> 01:13:18.273
and hang out, at the hotel.

01:13:19.819 --> 01:13:21.929
You want me to come to the hotel?

01:13:22.024 --> 01:13:23.803
Yеѕ. Ι wаnt yоu tо соmе…

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:26.529
by the hotel with me.

01:13:27.773 --> 01:13:29.947
Well, what would we do there?

01:13:30.088 --> 01:13:34.117
Maybe we can find somewhere quiet, and
have fun, and kind of see where it goes.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.366
Do it like… adults do sometimes, and…

01:13:39.593 --> 01:13:41.465
Like… sex?

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:43.376
Uh, I mean…

01:13:44.084 --> 01:13:47.548
if you want, if that’s
on the docket, but…

01:13:47.932 --> 01:13:49.640
I’m not trying to force that.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:51.922
So you would do sex with me?

01:13:52.079 --> 01:13:54.664
Do sex? What are you, Borat?

01:13:55.153 --> 01:13:56.650
Are you hitting on me?

01:13:56.687 --> 01:14:00.549
Yes, yes, I’m hitting on you.
You’re hot and cool and nice and

01:14:00.624 --> 01:14:02.129
you have beautiful eyes.

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:05.913
I’m sorry.

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:08.975
I’m married, I have two
kids, and I’m pregnant.

01:14:11.659 --> 01:14:15.096
That is what we call
the “hat trick.” Wow.

01:14:15.175 --> 01:14:17.602
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, I’m just…

01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:20.798
really enjoying you being so nice to me.

01:14:21.577 --> 01:14:25.074
No, I- I hope this doesn’t
come off as super cheesy,

01:14:25.655 --> 01:14:29.176
but uh, I think you’re a…
a very rare find.

01:14:29.736 --> 01:14:30.842
Thank you.

01:14:31.038 --> 01:14:32.856
And I would totally do sex with you.

01:14:36.069 --> 01:14:40.129
That was spectacular guys,
really well done, amazing.

01:14:40.153 --> 01:14:42.004
– Thank you.
– Good, good.

01:14:43.168 --> 01:14:44.072
Hey Graham!

01:14:44.192 --> 01:14:45.314
Pete! How are you, man?

01:14:45.853 --> 01:14:48.116
Well uh… the first numbers came in.

01:14:48.398 --> 01:14:49.895
Yeah, right yeah. Uh…

01:14:50.298 --> 01:14:52.098
Happy? How’s it looking?

01:14:52.411 --> 01:14:54.481
About half of your last record.

01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:57.574
Ah, so you were expecting it to sell.

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:00.284
They never sell anymore.
They used to sell.

01:15:00.387 --> 01:15:04.206
But now they don’t. I’m not
a sexy sixteen-year-old girl.

01:15:04.269 --> 01:15:06.532
But I wanted to sell it.
It’s such a good record.

01:15:06.552 --> 01:15:07.825
I feel like I let you down.

01:15:07.866 --> 01:15:11.723
Oh no, I’m gonna be fine, man.
My overheads are so low.

01:15:11.953 --> 01:15:13.896
I just got a song in Glee.

01:15:14.121 --> 01:15:16.925
Guy in the wheelchair is going
to sing it to the Asian girl, I believe.

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:19.411
I don’t know, I’ve never seen
the show, but that’s what I’m told.

01:15:19.445 --> 01:15:23.145
Secret is, make sure
you have a small nut.

01:15:23.254 --> 01:15:25.036
That’s the key to life.

01:15:25.192 --> 01:15:26.916
Graham, I don’t have
small nuts, all right?

01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:29.104
I have big nuts.
And I need to provide for them.

01:15:29.105 --> 01:15:30.220
Graham!

01:15:30.455 --> 01:15:31.382
Hey, hey, what’s up?

01:15:31.404 --> 01:15:33.292
– Billie! Hey, buddy!
– How you doing, man?

01:15:33.338 --> 01:15:35.281
– Great fucking show, man!
– I don’t get to see you!

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:37.171
– Fuck, yeah!
– Thank you.

01:15:37.184 --> 01:15:39.892
Like inspired. I wanna write
a fucking song right now.

01:15:39.939 --> 01:15:42.017
Inspired, huh? That inspires me.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:42.891
Let’s go get a drink.

01:15:42.904 --> 01:15:43.709
Let’s get a drink.

01:15:43.735 --> 01:15:44.902
Alright.
You coming?

01:15:44.912 --> 01:15:47.511
No no, I’m… I’m fine, you guys go.

01:15:47.954 --> 01:15:49.698
Congratulations on Glee.

01:15:51.021 --> 01:15:53.346
Yes, thank you. Right.
See you Pete.

01:15:53.683 --> 01:15:54.844
– Alright.
– Alright, see you.

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:55.821
So long guys.

01:15:56.642 --> 01:15:58.061
You got a song on Glee?

01:15:58.085 --> 01:15:58.670
Yeah.

01:15:58.686 --> 01:16:01.243
That’s killer, that’s so much money, it’s-

01:16:01.378 --> 01:16:02.751
It’s good that’s for all of us.

01:16:32.474 --> 01:16:35.042
Why did you put that
guy’s teeth in your mouth?

01:16:35.179 --> 01:16:36.782
That’s so gross.

01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:39.661
He was dirty.

01:16:39.685 --> 01:16:41.831
No, he was wearing a tie.

01:16:41.962 --> 01:16:43.862
– That’s true.
– He wasn’t dirty.

01:16:43.905 --> 01:16:47.539
When I kissed him, I felt his
little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue.

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:48.924
– You did?
– Yeah.

01:16:48.994 --> 01:16:52.026
It was like kissing a baby.
French kissing a baby.

01:16:56.073 --> 01:16:58.536
Can I ask you something stupid?

01:16:58.663 --> 01:17:01.645
 Do you know why we’re
missing money at the store?

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:03.426
Are you guys missing money?

01:17:03.516 --> 01:17:06.581
Yeah. Like twelve thousand dollars.

01:17:06.659 --> 01:17:08.449
Do you think I took it?

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:14.510
No. I mean, I- well, no, I did,
and I don’t now. But I don’t-

01:17:14.534 --> 01:17:15.344
It’s not me.

01:17:15.448 --> 01:17:20.578
Then, why do you live in such a nice
apartment and have such a fancy car?

01:17:20.759 --> 01:17:24.006
Yes, you’re right. Uhm… Look.

01:17:25.912 --> 01:17:29.902
I… am… an escort.

01:17:30.628 --> 01:17:33.625
I get paid to go out on dates.

01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:34.985
You…

01:17:36.673 --> 01:17:40.516
But only three to five times a year.
Ten times max.

01:17:41.936 --> 01:17:47.793
But it’s not technically “prostitution”
because I don’t have to sleep with them.

01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:49.139
Ah well, that’s good.

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:53.477
But I always do. That’s why I
only do it four to eight times a year,

01:17:53.534 --> 01:17:55.094
fifteen times max.

01:17:55.555 --> 01:17:56.391
Huh.

01:17:56.574 --> 01:17:58.374
One year I did it twenty.

01:17:58.563 --> 01:17:59.683
Well…

01:17:59.922 --> 01:18:01.714
As long as you think it’s safe.

01:18:01.816 --> 01:18:02.936
It’s safe.

01:18:03.056 --> 01:18:05.871
I only do it ten to thirty times a year.

01:18:06.392 --> 01:18:08.636
So, who do you think is stealing money?

01:18:09.479 --> 01:18:11.039
It’s fucking Jodi.

01:18:11.196 --> 01:18:11.922
No.

01:18:12.076 --> 01:18:14.133
Yeah. She’s a pilled-out whore.

01:18:16.175 --> 01:18:17.295
Huh.

01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:20.933
Since you told me, I’m-
I want to tell you something.

01:18:20.944 --> 01:18:22.504
You’re pregnant.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.527
How do you know?

01:18:26.762 --> 01:18:27.882
Wow.

01:18:28.553 --> 01:18:29.902
Maybe you should tell Pete.

01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:31.261
You didn’t tell Pete yet?

01:18:31.308 --> 01:18:32.339
I haven’t told Pete.

01:18:32.355 --> 01:18:33.027
Why?

01:18:33.055 --> 01:18:35.701
I don’t know.
I just want him to want me.

01:18:35.726 --> 01:18:38.630
I don’t want him to want me because I’m pregnant.

01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:42.563
Go home and fucking suck his dick
and tell him then and he will love it.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.780
– You think?
– He’ll be so excited.

01:18:45.076 --> 01:18:47.394
Or even better yet,
better yet-

01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:50.485
you should tell him
while you’re sucking his dick.

01:18:50.555 --> 01:18:52.643
Look. “I’m pregnant.”

01:18:58.679 --> 01:19:00.067
What are you doing?

01:19:00.298 --> 01:19:02.333
I’m returning some emails.

01:19:02.692 --> 01:19:04.564
What time do you have to go to work?

01:19:04.693 --> 01:19:06.330
Like ten minutes ago.

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:08.936
You wanna be late?

01:19:09.209 --> 01:19:11.866
No, I can’t be late.
Not today.

01:19:22.909 --> 01:19:26.063
Do you see me standing
here in front of you?

01:19:27.211 --> 01:19:28.141
Half-naked?

01:19:33.528 --> 01:19:34.590
Yeah.

01:19:34.915 --> 01:19:39.576
And does that…
make you feel anything, or…?

01:19:40.206 --> 01:19:42.485
Come on. Are you
trying to start a fight?

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:45.283
No, I’m not trying
to start a fight with you.

01:19:45.373 --> 01:19:46.775
I’m trying to fuck you!

01:19:46.852 --> 01:19:48.443
Oh God, you know what? Just…

01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:52.713
Today of all days is the day
you need to cut me a break.

01:19:52.973 --> 01:19:54.533
All right?
– Whatever.

01:19:55.033 --> 01:19:56.345
Oh God.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.040
What…?

01:20:03.038 --> 01:20:06.038
I didn’t realize it was intentional!

01:20:06.296 --> 01:20:09.496
I didn’t say anything because
I didn’t want you to be embarrassed.

01:20:09.498 --> 01:20:11.898
I thought I was being gallant.

01:20:13.532 --> 01:20:15.386
All right, fine, I’m an asshole.

01:20:16.215 --> 01:20:17.335
God.

01:20:20.188 --> 01:20:21.396
You know what your problem is?

01:20:21.472 --> 01:20:24.935
You’re never ever in the moment,
you’re never ever present.

01:20:25.022 --> 01:20:26.822
You’re never in your body.

01:20:26.877 --> 01:20:29.179
That’s not true.
I- I- I am in the moment.

01:20:29.198 --> 01:20:31.992
You know how I know? I want to
get the fuck out of the moment.

01:20:32.257 --> 01:20:33.817
I swear. It’s just- I can’t-

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:35.989
I can’t win with you.
I just can’t do it.

01:20:36.028 --> 01:20:37.619
You can’t just walk away.

01:20:37.721 --> 01:20:38.893
Oh, God.

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:40.502
Hey!

01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:42.814
How’s the record company going, Pete?

01:20:43.353 --> 01:20:44.827
What? Not great.

01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:47.397
I’m still waiting for
numbers to come in.

01:20:49.023 --> 01:20:50.823
What have you heard?

01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:54.714
A couple numbers have trickled in.
It’s lower than we expected.

01:20:56.847 --> 01:21:00.171
Then why are you giving Larry money?

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:01.804
What?

01:21:01.861 --> 01:21:04.500
I know everything.
I talked to the accountant.

01:21:04.836 --> 01:21:06.983
Right, you know what? I don’t
want to get into some nasty fight.

01:21:07.017 --> 01:21:10.303
So can we please talk to each other the way
the therapist told us to talk to each other?

01:21:10.382 --> 01:21:12.186
Fine. Fine!

01:21:13.226 --> 01:21:18.217
It makes me feel sad
when you are dishonest.

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:23.342
I understand it makes you feel bad
when I am dishonest with you.

01:21:23.731 --> 01:21:26.991
It hurts my feelings when
you treat me with contempt

01:21:27.045 --> 01:21:29.445
and corner me and try
and trick me into lying.

01:21:29.659 --> 01:21:30.667
Okay.

01:21:30.906 --> 01:21:34.427
It makes me sad when it’s
so easy to trick you into lying

01:21:34.434 --> 01:21:36.708
because you’re such a lying shitbag.

01:21:36.857 --> 01:21:38.456
That’s not- you can’t do that.
You can’t do that,

01:21:38.471 --> 01:21:40.753
the therapist said you’re
not allowed to judge me.

01:21:40.785 --> 01:21:42.710
That’s not a judgment.
That’s just a fact.

01:21:43.558 --> 01:21:44.602
Fair enough.

01:21:44.908 --> 01:21:48.587
Sometimes I withhold truth,
that is true.

01:21:48.988 --> 01:21:51.415
But it’s only because I’m scared to death

01:21:51.446 --> 01:21:55.206
of your crazy-assed
illogical overreactions.

01:21:55.246 --> 01:21:56.366
Well…

01:21:56.978 --> 01:22:01.577
It hurts me inside and triggers me
when you’re such a dishonest shit

01:22:01.624 --> 01:22:04.418
that you’re lending your father
money without telling me,

01:22:04.475 --> 01:22:06.394
while your record company
is going bankrupt

01:22:06.428 --> 01:22:09.863
and we’re on the verge
of losing our fucking house!

01:22:23.687 --> 01:22:25.552
What else are you lying about?

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:28.974
I’ve taken Viagra for two years.

01:22:29.009 --> 01:22:34.209
I ate six muffins downstairs a while ago
and my cholesterol level is 305.

01:22:34.374 --> 01:22:36.387
My heart could explode at any second.

01:22:36.449 --> 01:22:38.465
These might be my very last words.

01:22:38.765 --> 01:22:42.153
Oh! And I gave Charlotte antibiotics
when you weren’t looking.

01:22:42.217 --> 01:22:45.808
That’s why her ear got better.
So, go fuck your witch doctor.

01:22:47.473 --> 01:22:51.103
Are we even doing what we’re doing?

01:22:51.894 --> 01:22:53.994
This is not making me happy.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:57.171
You’re not happy. You don’t like me.

01:22:57.345 --> 01:23:01.085
I can feel that. I’m not blind.

01:23:02.069 --> 01:23:06.111
Jesus. We’re like business associates.

01:23:06.378 --> 01:23:09.691
We’re like brother and sister.
There’s no passion there.

01:23:09.714 --> 01:23:11.660
We’re not like brother and sister.
You know what we’re like?

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:15.105
We’re like Simon and Garfunkel, and
somehow you turned me into Garfunkel.

01:23:15.235 --> 01:23:16.678
I don’t even know what that means!

01:23:16.751 --> 01:23:17.756
Art Garfunkel!

01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:21.451
What’s wrong with Art Garfunkel?
He has a beautiful voice.

01:23:21.491 --> 01:23:23.926
He’s got an amazing voice.
He could put a harmony to anything,

01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:26.527
but what I’m saying is that
you turned me into him!

01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:27.987
What the hell are you talking about?

01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:29.885
What-
– Simon controls him!

01:23:29.986 --> 01:23:33.916
That’s because Simon
writes the fucking songs!

01:23:34.216 --> 01:23:35.897
He’s the better one.

01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:37.584
You know what? I see
the way you look at our kids.

01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:39.974
You have so much love and
compassion for them.

01:23:40.003 --> 01:23:42.302
You never look at me like that. Ever.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:46.308
Would we even still be together if
I didn’t get pregnant fourteen y-?

01:23:46.324 --> 01:23:49.095
You know what? I’m not gonna
go down that road. That-

01:23:50.193 --> 01:23:51.360
Would we?

01:24:06.913 --> 01:24:07.811
Okay.

01:24:11.024 --> 01:24:13.639
You know what? I don’t even
wanna have a party here.

01:24:13.726 --> 01:24:15.107
You need to cancel it.

01:24:15.253 --> 01:24:18.961
No, I’m not. I already paid for
the catering, I put down deposits,

01:24:18.969 --> 01:24:21.055
and I sure as fuck I’m not
gonna call everybody back

01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:23.278
in two days when you change your mind.

01:24:29.516 --> 01:24:31.883
<i>Your girlfriend is not ugly.</i>

01:24:33.141 --> 01:24:35.045
<i>Actually Larry, she’s not my girlfriend,</i>

01:24:35.061 --> 01:24:37.076
<i>she’s just a-
– It’s cool, buddy.</i>

01:24:37.123 --> 01:24:39.081
<i>You don’t have to explain
your girlfriend to me.</i>

01:24:39.113 --> 01:24:39.886
<i>But she’s not-</i>

01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:42.911
Can you please stop licking your fingers?

01:24:44.199 --> 01:24:47.149
Do you know how many
germs are on your hands?

01:24:47.385 --> 01:24:49.274
And you’re putting them into your mouth.

01:24:49.746 --> 01:24:51.392
That’s gross. Stop.

01:24:55.178 --> 01:24:56.303
Stop it!

01:24:56.389 --> 01:24:57.191
I’m gonna kill you!

01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.152
Hey! Sadie! Enough!

01:24:59.292 --> 01:25:00.688
Alright, she isn’t hurting anyone.

01:25:00.711 --> 01:25:02.547
You wanna say something,
just keep your mouth shut.

01:25:02.559 --> 01:25:05.556
You have never been nice to her and
now she’s getting aggressive with you.

01:25:05.571 --> 01:25:07.670
I told you this would happen.

01:25:15.269 --> 01:25:17.730
I’m sick of everybody fighting.

01:25:57.234 --> 01:26:00.234
What do you think you’re going
to be like when you grow up?

01:26:02.835 --> 01:26:04.919
I don’t know. Hum…

01:26:06.527 --> 01:26:07.793
I don’t know.

01:26:08.683 --> 01:26:10.524
Do you think you want kids?

01:26:11.038 --> 01:26:12.258
Mm-hmm. Just one.

01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:13.830
Just one? Why?

01:26:13.899 --> 01:26:19.256
Because if I have two then the
other will fight with the other one.

01:26:19.381 --> 01:26:21.781
Does it make you sad when you fight?

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.589
I don’t want anyone to fight.

01:26:32.858 --> 01:26:34.418
I love you.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.306
Why isn’t anybody talking?
Why is it so quiet?

01:27:10.305 --> 01:27:12.105
It’s the sounds of silence.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:22.863
♪I don’t think that I can
really survive…

01:27:28.975 --> 01:27:32.106
♪I’m praying for the end of time,
it’s all that I can do

01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:42.308

How many of those are you gonna eat?

01:27:50.503 --> 01:27:51.706
As many as I want.

01:27:52.213 --> 01:27:53.914
I’m gonna tell Mom on you.

01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:55.999
Try it. See what you get for Christmas.

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.707
Nothing.

01:27:58.582 --> 01:28:00.817
Snitches wind up in ditches.

01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:02.976
Remember that.

01:28:08.032 --> 01:28:09.305
Hey, Peter.

01:28:09.374 --> 01:28:10.574
– Hi!
– Hi.

01:28:14.988 --> 01:28:16.808
Alright. It’s here.

01:28:17.478 --> 01:28:18.835
Have a good one.

01:28:19.476 --> 01:28:20.596
Peter?

01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:22.328
Peter!

01:28:24.062 --> 01:28:24.895
Hi!

01:28:25.036 --> 01:28:26.156
Catherine.

01:28:26.273 --> 01:28:27.614
I’m Joseph’s mother.

01:28:27.673 --> 01:28:29.811
Oh, right. No, I know.
Hi, Catherine.

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:32.389
Our kids have gone to school
together for eight years.

01:28:32.429 --> 01:28:33.801
I… Sorry.

01:28:34.169 --> 01:28:35.463
Hello, Joseph.

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:39.799
I hear our kids have
been chatting online.

01:28:39.884 --> 01:28:42.625
Yeah? I heard that your wife
has been screaming at my son,

01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:43.664
and I don’t appreciate it.

01:28:43.716 --> 01:28:44.492
Excuse me?

01:28:44.531 --> 01:28:46.396
She screamed at my son.

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:49.980
Right? She threatened you?
She cursed at him.

01:28:50.187 --> 01:28:51.880
Hey, he’s thirteen years
old for god’s sake.

01:28:51.939 --> 01:28:53.512
What the hell is the matter with her?

01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:55.950
Hey, you better check her meds
and get them right.

01:28:56.678 --> 01:28:58.950
Okay, you know,
why don’t- why don’t you…

01:28:59.162 --> 01:29:03.043
back the fuck off, because that’s my
lovely, sweet wife you’re talking about.

01:29:03.096 --> 01:29:04.527
– Oh, I need to back off?
– Yeah, you need to back off,

01:29:04.537 --> 01:29:07.671
’cause your kid is an animal.
He’s a fucking animal.

01:29:07.715 --> 01:29:09.939
Why don’t you put him on a leash?
– Turn around. Turn around, turn around!

01:29:09.994 --> 01:29:10.931
Turn around!

01:29:11.033 --> 01:29:14.124
He insults my daughter again,
I’m gonna hit him with my fucking car.

01:29:14.298 --> 01:29:17.191
Got it? In fact, if you insult my wife
again, you know what I’m gonna do?

01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:19.044
I’m gonna show up at your
house when you’re sleeping,

01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:22.029
and I’ll take your iPad
or your iPod or your iMac,

01:29:22.045 --> 01:29:23.722
and I’ll shove them up your fucking iCunt.

01:29:23.738 --> 01:29:27.009
I’ve got nothing to lose.
Your kid is the problem.

01:29:27.044 --> 01:29:30.642
My kid is a fucking angel.
I don’t have time for this shit.

01:29:30.693 --> 01:29:33.940
So I’m keeping it together.
But if I wasn’t at school right now…

01:29:35.417 --> 01:29:37.805
You touched my…
touched me?

01:29:37.964 --> 01:29:40.035
– I didn’t touch you.
– You touched my upper breast!

01:29:40.072 --> 01:29:42.241
I didn’t. I didn’t. I got right
below your shoulder.

01:29:42.296 --> 01:29:45.179
You got right here. You actually-
He hit my nipple!

01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:46.061
You what?

01:29:46.234 --> 01:29:47.153
You’re insane!

01:29:47.168 --> 01:29:48.177
Why would you do that?

01:29:48.187 --> 01:29:49.286
Did you just touch my mom’s nipple?

01:29:49.302 --> 01:29:51.831
He just touched my nipple!
Why would you do that to me?

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.104
I poked you on the shoulder.

01:29:53.118 --> 01:29:54.573
I have very high nipples.

01:29:54.659 --> 01:29:55.820
I touched your shirt.

01:29:55.825 --> 01:29:57.172
What do you think is under my shirt?

01:29:57.177 --> 01:29:58.609
– I just touched-
– My breasts are under my shirt.

01:29:58.624 --> 01:30:00.504
Your shoulder, your shoulder.
He just touched my breast.

01:30:00.527 --> 01:30:03.470
Well, that’s a funny place
to put a shoulder. On my boob!

01:30:03.494 --> 01:30:05.493
Hello! There are children around.

01:30:05.604 --> 01:30:08.604
This isn’t over. This is not over.
You’re gonna be sorry.

01:30:08.672 --> 01:30:10.961
Let’s go. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

01:30:11.089 --> 01:30:13.398
And why the fuck would you believe Desi?

01:30:13.637 --> 01:30:15.437
You just admitted it.

01:30:16.047 --> 01:30:16.930
Did I?

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.897
You stole twelve thousand
dollars from me Jodi,

01:30:19.906 --> 01:30:21.755
and I need you to pay me back.

01:30:21.869 --> 01:30:24.154
Can you at least give me a referral?

01:30:24.193 --> 01:30:27.862
You babysat my kids
while you were on Oxycontin.

01:30:27.904 --> 01:30:29.019
Oxycodon.

01:30:29.058 --> 01:30:30.433
Well, Oxycodon.

01:30:30.464 --> 01:30:31.584
Oxyconten.

01:30:31.690 --> 01:30:32.734
Oxyconten?

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:33.805
Oxykitten.

01:30:33.919 --> 01:30:35.297
What’s Oxykitten?

01:30:35.673 --> 01:30:36.485
Meow.

01:30:36.693 --> 01:30:40.589
Jodi. You put me in danger.
Me and my family.

01:30:40.748 --> 01:30:42.269
It was a cry for help!

01:30:42.925 --> 01:30:44.045
Help!

01:30:44.425 --> 01:30:45.545
Help.

01:30:45.682 --> 01:30:47.390
Why don’t you help me?

01:30:47.621 --> 01:30:49.679
Why don’t you help me?
Just help.

01:30:49.946 --> 01:30:51.514
Just Help.

01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:53.771
Just Help.

01:30:54.459 --> 01:30:55.967
Why don’t you help me?

01:30:56.162 --> 01:30:57.597
Are you high right now?

01:30:57.714 --> 01:30:59.769
Help me!

01:31:02.549 --> 01:31:03.999
Is that about me?

01:31:04.056 --> 01:31:05.195
Is that the cops?

01:31:05.491 --> 01:31:06.781
Is this a set-up?

01:31:06.854 --> 01:31:08.414
I need to go.

01:31:08.492 --> 01:31:10.116
Okay, see you later.

01:31:10.864 --> 01:31:12.666
Fuck you, Debbie.

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:14.885
Fuck. You.

01:31:16.065 --> 01:31:19.242
Joseph was very upset
when I spoke to him about this,

01:31:19.566 --> 01:31:22.306
so I thought it was important that we…

01:31:23.067 --> 01:31:24.837
join together and work this through.

01:31:24.923 --> 01:31:26.288
Absolutely.

01:31:26.412 --> 01:31:28.659
Uh, we’re gonna work through it, but

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.186
Debbie, uh told my son that

01:31:31.366 --> 01:31:34.366
he looked like Tom Petty,
in a negative way--

01:31:34.435 --> 01:31:35.396
Who’s Tom Petty?

01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:37.245
You know who Tom Petty is.

01:31:37.422 --> 01:31:40.380
And she said that if she had to
come back, that she was going

01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:43.854
to “F-up his pussy ass.”

01:31:44.048 --> 01:31:45.817
Which is what she said.

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:49.169
Are you serious? I didn’t.

01:31:49.384 --> 01:31:51.700
I would never. To a child?

01:31:52.023 --> 01:31:57.371
Your son has been defiling my daughter’s
Facebook page now for months.

01:31:57.558 --> 01:31:59.036
These people are liars.

01:31:59.209 --> 01:32:01.090
He said that my son was an animal,

01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:04.729
and that if I didn’t keep him on a leash
that he would hit him with his car.

01:32:04.987 --> 01:32:05.928
Did you say that?

01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:07.714
That’s- that’s ridiculous.

01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:09.288
Who talks like that?
– You do.

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:10.210
He didn’t say that.

01:32:10.253 --> 01:32:12.594
– Alright, you know, no, what I said,
– He said it to me!

01:32:12.702 --> 01:32:15.137
was that we need to keep
an extra eye on our kids

01:32:15.147 --> 01:32:17.941
because with all the
technological advances,

01:32:17.991 --> 01:32:20.254
they need to learn
to use them responsibly.

01:32:20.277 --> 01:32:22.399
No, No. What he- what he said to me,

01:32:22.408 --> 01:32:23.571
was- he called me an “iCunt.”

01:32:23.588 --> 01:32:25.251
– A what?
– Language, Catherine, language!

01:32:25.267 --> 01:32:26.353
I’m quoting him!

01:32:26.409 --> 01:32:30.740
How am I gonna relay what these
two nutballs said to me unless I say it.

01:32:30.758 --> 01:32:32.562
Can you please not talk
like that, Catherine?

01:32:32.563 --> 01:32:34.115
Music Man is rehearsing next door.

01:32:34.133 --> 01:32:35.912
Sorry, fucking Music Man.

01:32:36.429 --> 01:32:39.817
Maybe if I looked more like
this fake bullshit couple,

01:32:39.875 --> 01:32:41.504
looks like they’re in a bank commercial.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.768
That’s what you look like.

01:32:42.888 --> 01:32:45.206
Like you’re a bullshit
bank commercial couple.

01:32:45.356 --> 01:32:47.924
None of this talk is productive.

01:32:47.944 --> 01:32:50.762
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

01:32:50.785 --> 01:32:54.167
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

01:32:54.299 --> 01:32:55.954
You’re just really scaring me.

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.210
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

01:32:58.256 --> 01:33:00.655
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

01:33:00.726 --> 01:33:01.926
I’ll chew through you.

01:33:02.073 --> 01:33:03.516
Catherine, you’re better than this.

01:33:03.552 --> 01:33:06.344
Fuck you, Jill. You’re
a horrible fucking woman.

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:09.941
This is why everybody hates you, Jill.
This kinda shit.

01:33:10.098 --> 01:33:13.410
Ineffective, fucking bullshit hair.

01:33:14.170 --> 01:33:16.127
And I’m glad your husband died.

01:33:16.548 --> 01:33:19.577
Because you’re a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

01:33:20.033 --> 01:33:22.405
Okay, Catherine, I think we
know what’s happening now.

01:33:23.132 --> 01:33:25.225
Now you know what we’re dealing with.

01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:10.557
I’m not gonna eat that chicken.

01:34:10.805 --> 01:34:12.002
Why not?

01:34:12.839 --> 01:34:15.079
Because I feel like
I’m gonna be a vegetarian.

01:34:15.151 --> 01:34:16.875
Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow?

01:34:16.914 --> 01:34:17.563
Huh-huh.

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:20.045
You guys have been reading my texts?

01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:21.451
No, we haven’t.

01:34:21.491 --> 01:34:22.467
Yes, we have.

01:34:22.498 --> 01:34:24.323
We’re supposed to keep an eye on you.

01:34:24.396 --> 01:34:25.636
How did you find out?

01:34:25.683 --> 01:34:28.758
Joseph told me that you
flipped out on him and his mom,

01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:30.915
and that you guys are nuts, and I agree.

01:34:30.952 --> 01:34:32.752
Alright. Don’t be disrespectful.

01:34:32.939 --> 01:34:36.921
You are the ones who are disrespectful.
Reading my texts is like reading my diary.

01:34:36.959 --> 01:34:40.207
And you were really sweet on your iChat.
We were really proud of you.

01:34:40.222 --> 01:34:42.626
Yeah, we were gonna give you
your computer and phone back.

01:34:42.638 --> 01:34:43.860
Fuck you!

01:34:44.192 --> 01:34:46.658
Okay, there’s the first
official “Fuck you.”

01:34:46.705 --> 01:34:49.611
Okay, that is not how we talk
to each other in this house.

01:34:49.653 --> 01:34:52.838
You guys talk to each other
like that all the time!

01:34:53.089 --> 01:34:56.649
And to Joseph and his mom.
You made Joseph cry.

01:34:56.913 --> 01:35:00.793
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.

01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:02.769
Shut up, Charlotte.

01:35:02.819 --> 01:35:06.808
You guys so desperately want me
to be perfect and to make no mistakes.

01:35:06.832 --> 01:35:09.191
Well, you two are fucking insane.

01:35:09.225 --> 01:35:10.090
Okay.

01:35:10.143 --> 01:35:13.243
All you do is fight. Or you
don’t fight, which is even worse

01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:15.708
’cause it looks like you
hate each other for weeks.

01:35:15.732 --> 01:35:18.198
You obsess over every little thing I do,

01:35:18.215 --> 01:35:22.330
and you don’t trust in me or believe in
me, well I’m fucking sick of it!

01:35:22.628 --> 01:35:24.141
Yeah, I said “fuck.”

01:35:24.332 --> 01:35:25.805
Fuck fuck fuck.

01:35:25.956 --> 01:35:30.391
Ground me forever I don’t care.
I don’t care about anything.

01:35:31.128 --> 01:35:37.227
I hate everything, everyone’s going crazy,
I don’t care if I have no friends.

01:35:37.915 --> 01:35:39.868
Are you still upset about Lost?

01:35:39.963 --> 01:35:41.343
Of course I’m upset about Lost!

01:35:41.354 --> 01:35:45.335
You guys took away my shit before
I could watch the last two episodes!

01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.779
Now I don’t know what the fuck happens!

01:35:52.388 --> 01:35:54.565
She’s becoming just like us.

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:59.541
I hope I never get my period
if this is what happens.

01:36:12.401 --> 01:36:14.213
Where did you find these?

01:36:14.537 --> 01:36:15.994
I stole them.

01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:23.210
Thank you.

01:36:24.444 --> 01:36:25.637
No big deal.

01:36:29.262 --> 01:36:32.541
Our kids are crazy.
And it’s our fault.

01:36:33.225 --> 01:36:36.449
But do you think there’s anything
we can do to turn it around, or…?

01:36:36.482 --> 01:36:39.402
Sadie’s thirteen.
She might be a lost cause.

01:36:39.442 --> 01:36:42.744
I mean, where did she learn that kind
of language? We don’t talk like that.

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.445
I have no fucking idea…

01:36:44.844 --> 01:36:47.664
Do you think Sadie is
this crazy because of us?

01:36:47.744 --> 01:36:50.483
Or is it hormones and Lost.

01:36:50.699 --> 01:36:54.524
J. J. Abrams.
He’s ruining our daughter.

01:36:54.571 --> 01:36:55.329
Yeah.

01:36:55.368 --> 01:36:57.048
That fucking geek.

01:36:57.151 --> 01:36:59.758
I feel bad for us!
I feel bad for us.

01:36:59.798 --> 01:37:03.764
All of a sudden we’re like
a magnet for negativity.

01:37:03.866 --> 01:37:05.788
Why do people keep attacking us?

01:37:06.341 --> 01:37:09.838
What did we do?
We’re just doing our best.

01:37:10.472 --> 01:37:11.979
Should we talk about our fight?

01:37:12.151 --> 01:37:17.101
I think we’re under enough pressure.
Let’s just let it go this time.

01:37:17.443 --> 01:37:18.643
Yeah.

01:37:18.714 --> 01:37:20.260
We can give each other a break.

01:37:20.302 --> 01:37:22.362
Alright, great. Thank you.

01:37:22.465 --> 01:37:25.573
And I’m sorry about my dad.
You’re right. This is…

01:37:26.573 --> 01:37:30.646
I’m sorry that he’s just an endless mooch.

01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:36.031
The truth is, this isn’t about us.
It’s about our parents.

01:37:36.238 --> 01:37:38.993
We’re not even mad at each other.
We’re mad at them.

01:37:39.008 --> 01:37:40.774
Exactly!
Exactly.

01:37:40.841 --> 01:37:44.346
Let’s just take away our
parents’ power by loving them.

01:37:44.724 --> 01:37:45.870
Can we do that?

01:37:46.347 --> 01:37:47.547
Yes.

01:37:48.116 --> 01:37:49.422
Thank God.

01:37:49.606 --> 01:37:52.006
I kind of feel better already, do you?

01:37:52.145 --> 01:37:53.392
Do you?
– I- I do.

01:37:53.682 --> 01:37:55.689
– I love you.
– I love you too.

01:38:00.607 --> 01:38:02.482
It’s not us, it’s them.

01:38:02.665 --> 01:38:04.225
Totally.

01:38:15.527 --> 01:38:17.691
What are you doing?
We have to get ready for the party.

01:38:17.722 --> 01:38:20.535
I just watched the last episode of Lost.

01:38:22.108 --> 01:38:23.228
Okay.

01:38:23.592 --> 01:38:26.441
You know what? We don’t
have time for this right now.

01:38:26.668 --> 01:38:29.332
We have a lot of people coming over--
– They’re all dead.

01:38:30.197 --> 01:38:31.056
What?

01:38:31.451 --> 01:38:33.870
Jack… Kate…

01:38:34.824 --> 01:38:36.284
Sawyer…
– I don’t care

01:38:36.313 --> 01:38:37.279
– about the show
– Jin…

01:38:37.325 --> 01:38:39.092
– right now. Okay?
– Sun…

01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:40.280
– I need you to just get in the shower,
– Walt…

01:38:40.298 --> 01:38:42.561
Get dressed. Let’s just put it on hold!
Juliet…

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:44.405
All those people.

01:38:44.445 --> 01:38:47.708
Don’t think about Lost today.
Tomorrow: Lost. All day.

01:38:47.782 --> 01:38:51.139
I can’t wait to hear about it.
Jack? No way. Really?

01:38:51.177 --> 01:38:52.482
Right now, shower.

01:38:52.532 --> 01:38:55.209
I don’t make fun of
your stupid Mad Men!

01:38:55.284 --> 01:38:57.568
First of all, I don’t get
worked up over Mad Men.

01:38:57.594 --> 01:38:59.264
That’s ’cause Mad Men sucks!

01:38:59.389 --> 01:39:01.300
What Don Draper has gone through

01:39:01.357 --> 01:39:04.504
beats whatever Jack is running
from on some fucking island.

01:39:04.531 --> 01:39:07.433
A bunch of people smoking
in an office, it’s stupid.

01:39:07.488 --> 01:39:09.509
Wait wait, I’m not-
you’re getting me off topic.

01:39:09.555 --> 01:39:11.407
Just please get dressed.

01:39:16.273 --> 01:39:17.896
Hello!
Hi!

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.551
I am so glad you’re here.
– Yeah.

01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:21.436
I need a buffer in case it gets weird.

01:39:21.501 --> 01:39:23.217
Oh! Well, I’m ready to buff.

01:39:23.613 --> 01:39:25.920
– Rіght. Grаb thеѕе nарkіnѕ.
– Lеt’ѕ buff.

01:39:29.431 --> 01:39:31.710
So uh, so that’s the
girl who works, uh,

01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:33.105
that’s the girl who works for you.

01:39:33.134 --> 01:39:35.464
– Yeah, that’s her.
– .. works for Debbie.

01:39:35.539 --> 01:39:36.622
Seems nice.

01:39:37.197 --> 01:39:39.497
My wife would never let me
have a hot employee like that.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:40.591
– Yeah?
– No.

01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:42.644
Every woman that works for us…

01:39:42.793 --> 01:39:45.153
looks like they’ve been in
some kind of horrible accident.

01:39:50.772 --> 01:39:53.772
You’re comfortable with
that around your husband?

01:39:54.302 --> 01:39:56.702
Aw. Pete wouldn’t know
what to do with that.

01:39:57.522 --> 01:39:59.408
You think our wives
are looking at us right now?

01:39:59.439 --> 01:40:00.673
– Oh, definitely.
– Yeah.

01:40:01.090 --> 01:40:02.890
They look like pedophiles.

01:40:08.656 --> 01:40:09.466
Thank you.

01:40:09.505 --> 01:40:12.065
.. And the girls are so excited.
They’re all outside.

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:13.963
– Hi. Happy birthday.
– Hi. Oh thank you very much.

01:40:14.003 --> 01:40:15.930
– Hey. How are you, man?
– How are you?

01:40:15.946 --> 01:40:16.969
Good to see you.

01:40:17.001 --> 01:40:20.139
Happy birthday Pete,
how wonderful to see you!

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:21.988
– Grandma Molly!
– Oh you’re wonderful.

01:40:22.019 --> 01:40:24.738
And look at my gorgeous, gorgeous…

01:40:24.839 --> 01:40:25.961
Gorgeous!

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.969
No. I get that, I’m just
wondering why I should-

01:40:28.003 --> 01:40:30.196
Hey, Pete! Pete! Jason’s here.

01:40:30.271 --> 01:40:31.495
Peter. Hi.

01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:33.398
– Hey, how’s it going, Jason?
– Great, you look well.

01:40:33.433 --> 01:40:34.690
– Thank you.
– Yeah.

01:40:34.703 --> 01:40:36.708
How do you like what
I’ve been doing to your girl?

01:40:36.727 --> 01:40:38.451
How do you like Debbie’s after body?

01:40:38.487 --> 01:40:40.016
– It’s nice.
– Come on, show ‘em.

01:40:40.247 --> 01:40:42.010
Look at this.
It’s beautiful.

01:40:42.044 --> 01:40:43.463
Look at that afterass.

01:40:43.518 --> 01:40:45.570
Now it starts here…

01:40:45.818 --> 01:40:47.969
but it used to start here…

01:40:48.012 --> 01:40:49.986
and I brought it up.

01:40:51.018 --> 01:40:52.697
You’re welcome.

01:40:52.723 --> 01:40:55.033
Sir, are- are you a trainer?

01:40:55.721 --> 01:40:56.976
– Yes.
– Huh.

01:40:57.046 --> 01:40:59.702
Well. But not just physical.
Spiritual.

01:40:59.789 --> 01:41:01.215
I’m sort of a guide.
– Mm-hmm.

01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:02.943
You guys should talk.
I think you’ll-

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.450
– Du- uh…
– you’ll… get along.

01:41:05.698 --> 01:41:07.463
Come here, honey,
I gotta tell you something.

01:41:07.495 --> 01:41:08.615
Yeah.

01:41:17.534 --> 01:41:18.737
Who’s that in the pool?

01:41:18.771 --> 01:41:19.971
Mine.

01:41:22.956 --> 01:41:24.062
Hello.

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:24.711
Hello, Debbie.

01:41:24.742 --> 01:41:25.735
How are you?

01:41:25.736 --> 01:41:26.562
Good

01:41:26.715 --> 01:41:28.515
Remember my husband, Pete?

01:41:28.578 --> 01:41:31.880
Oh right, yes! I- I didn’t
recognize you with the long hair.

01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:34.411
Oh yeah, I- no, I’ve been growing it.

01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:35.283
Happy birthday.

01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:37.237
Oh! Thank you so much!

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.479
Very old scotch.

01:41:38.527 --> 01:41:41.837
Oh, wow. You know,
I- I hope it hasn’t expired.

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:44.892
No, scotch doesn’t expire.

01:41:45.822 --> 01:41:47.229
It improves with age.

01:41:49.103 --> 01:41:52.139
Yeah. No, I know.
Uh, thank you so much.

01:41:52.195 --> 01:41:53.770
Nice.
Come on in!

01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:55.014
– Sure.
– Sorry.

01:41:58.585 --> 01:42:01.340
So uh, what do you do in Chino, Oliver?

01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:02.255
I am a surgeon.

01:42:02.278 --> 01:42:04.215
– Wow. What kind?
– That’s great.

01:42:04.892 --> 01:42:06.171
Mainly of the spine.

01:42:07.026 --> 01:42:10.225
My specialty is scoliosis surgery.

01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:13.989
Now my mom used to talk
to me like I had a scoliosis

01:42:13.997 --> 01:42:17.004
’cause I’m, you know, a little hunchy,
but that’s a different thing.

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.896
No, you definitely don’t look right.

01:42:18.943 --> 01:42:20.099
– Hey!
– Hey!

01:42:20.201 --> 01:42:22.185
– Hey!
– Sorry we’re late!

01:42:22.242 --> 01:42:24.403
I was in the lab cloning myself.

01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:26.546
We’re gonna have another
seven more tomorrow.

01:42:26.587 --> 01:42:29.834
We cut their hair different so
we can finally tell who they are!

01:42:29.916 --> 01:42:31.866
You like the new haircut, Travis?

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:33.264
I’m Jack, damn it!

01:42:33.304 --> 01:42:34.958
Oh, of course.

01:42:35.038 --> 01:42:36.838
Larry, this is my father.

01:42:37.174 --> 01:42:38.234
Really?

01:42:38.915 --> 01:42:40.304
How are you?

01:42:40.341 --> 01:42:42.257
– Oliver.
– Oliver? Oh!

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.052
“Can I have some more?”

01:42:44.328 --> 01:42:47.099
“Please, Oliver, I need a little morsel.”

01:42:47.132 --> 01:42:48.317
 I love that movie.

01:42:48.501 --> 01:42:50.520
You must get that all the time.

01:42:50.551 --> 01:42:51.092
Not really.

01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:52.908
My nose itches right here.

01:42:52.934 --> 01:42:55.392
I’m sorry, excuse me. I’m
Claire, and I’m Larry’s wife.

01:42:55.428 --> 01:42:58.136
Very nice to see you, but
I’m gonna go get the kids.

01:42:58.788 --> 01:43:01.082
We won’t see her now for the whole day.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:05.074
I’d help honey, but you know, I’ve got
the blood pressure, and I don’t want to.

01:43:05.223 --> 01:43:06.338
Can I get you a drink Dad?

01:43:06.361 --> 01:43:07.127
– Yeah.
– Want something?

01:43:07.146 --> 01:43:08.166
A white wine.

01:43:08.197 --> 01:43:09.025
– White wine?
– Yeah.

01:43:09.042 --> 01:43:10.595
– Oh, heavy stuff.
– Yeah.

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:14.156
So, who knew that Debbie had a dad!

01:43:14.635 --> 01:43:19.351
Where have you been for fifteen years?
Never seen you at Hanukkah, Christmas, or

01:43:19.407 --> 01:43:22.788
Ramadan, nothing. How do you get out
of all that stuff? Do you have a wife?

01:43:22.869 --> 01:43:24.390
Yeah, my wife’s at home.

01:43:24.423 --> 01:43:25.587
Oh, why- why didn’t she come?

01:43:25.626 --> 01:43:28.108
A construction.
They’re sanding our deck.

01:43:28.257 --> 01:43:29.897
You let the woman sand the deck?

01:43:30.125 --> 01:43:32.146
She supervises it, yes.

01:43:32.193 --> 01:43:33.021
Okay.

01:43:33.068 --> 01:43:34.214
Hey, guys.

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:35.924
Hey!

01:43:35.972 --> 01:43:40.361
Look how big the kids are!
Sadie!

01:43:40.787 --> 01:43:41.941
Hi, Larry.

01:43:42.003 --> 01:43:43.269
Hi, Sadie.

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:46.245
Mom. Who- who’s Oliver?

01:43:46.894 --> 01:43:47.821
What do you mean?

01:43:47.904 --> 01:43:48.907
Is he your dad?

01:43:49.064 --> 01:43:51.954
Is he my Da-
He is my biological father.

01:43:52.587 --> 01:43:53.920
What does that mean?

01:43:53.989 --> 01:43:57.752
Hm, it means that my mum, grandma-

01:43:57.954 --> 01:44:01.092
he and my mom had a baby and that was me!

01:44:01.263 --> 01:44:03.063
Oh, so you’re our grandpa.

01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:05.764
Uh, well, why don’t you ask your mother?

01:44:05.928 --> 01:44:06.896
Yeah.

01:44:07.003 --> 01:44:10.032
I guess so then, that would make
him your grandfather, then yes.

01:44:10.129 --> 01:44:11.110
Do you want him to be?

01:44:11.124 --> 01:44:14.124
Yes. Then we get another
grandpa. Come on!

01:44:14.536 --> 01:44:15.656
Wha…?

01:44:15.958 --> 01:44:18.651
– Another Grandpa?!
– Trampoline time.

01:44:20.218 --> 01:44:22.653
Yeah that was deeply uncomfortable.

01:44:23.877 --> 01:44:27.859
At least that pretty girl was
here to divert our attention.

01:44:44.242 --> 01:44:47.817
Oh. My gosh, hi. Me or mine,
I did not see you there.

01:44:47.853 --> 01:44:49.452
– Hi.
– I saw you there.

01:44:49.507 --> 01:44:52.428
Did you guys come together?
Are you… a couple?

01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:57.114
– No, we didn’t come together.
– No. No. Absolutely not.

01:44:57.203 --> 01:44:59.068
I just- I’m sorry, I thought it was a-

01:44:59.187 --> 01:45:00.536
the mustache is a little…

01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:02.052
Hmm. That’s fair.

01:45:02.093 --> 01:45:02.981
I just assumed.

01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:04.958
This is a straight man mustache.

01:45:05.225 --> 01:45:10.457
What is the different between a gay man’s
mustache and a… straight man’s mustache?

01:45:10.829 --> 01:45:12.105
The smell.

01:45:15.234 --> 01:45:17.034
Ah. Excuse me.

01:45:22.994 --> 01:45:29.787
So, spinal surgery, it just seems to me
to be at the top of the surgery chain.

01:45:30.068 --> 01:45:32.565
Well, we’re not cardio, we’re not neuro…

01:45:32.613 --> 01:45:36.165
but I like to think we’re
an important part of the spectrum.

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.665
Do you operate every single day?

01:45:37.697 --> 01:45:38.501
Most days.

01:45:38.626 --> 01:45:39.842
Multiple times a day?

01:45:39.926 --> 01:45:41.655
Three, four times.

01:45:41.757 --> 01:45:45.036
So what’s the price range?
Like if I wanted a--

01:45:45.249 --> 01:45:47.049
– I- I’d rather not say.
– Oh I’m ju--

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:49.911
It’s so big you’re embarrassed to say.

01:45:50.175 --> 01:45:51.821
I wouldn’t say embarrassed.

01:45:52.091 --> 01:45:53.602
Are there hunchbacks today?

01:45:53.664 --> 01:45:55.224
– Of course.
– I’ve never seen one.

01:45:55.266 --> 01:45:57.427
Well, that’s because
there are spinal surgeons.

01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.637
That’s ’cause of you.

01:45:58.694 --> 01:46:02.653
Each time I don’t see a hunchback,
you’re getting that much richer.

01:46:03.786 --> 01:46:05.221
You like The Beatles, don’t you?

01:46:06.065 --> 01:46:07.244
Who doesn’t like The Beatles?

01:46:07.312 --> 01:46:08.643
– Nobody.
– No. Nobody.

01:46:10.424 --> 01:46:12.380
So funny. He’s so funny.

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.040
What is your sun sign?

01:46:14.312 --> 01:46:15.157
Libra.

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.563
– Oh, boy.
– That’s not good.

01:46:16.587 --> 01:46:17.313
No, sir.

01:46:17.326 --> 01:46:19.331
That’s not good.
Not for me, that’s not good.

01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:21.141
Sexually we are completely incompatible.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.407
– Absolutely.
– That’s not true.

01:46:22.415 --> 01:46:23.928
– Right?
– That’s such a shame. Yeah.

01:46:23.975 --> 01:46:25.629
No, it’s- I mean, as bad as it gets.

01:46:25.666 --> 01:46:27.347
– You don’t know.
– What is yours?

01:46:28.043 --> 01:46:29.603
I’m a Cancer.

01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:31.803
– Really?
– Is that good?

01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:32.644
Wow.

01:46:32.682 --> 01:46:34.482
– What does that mean?
– That’s kind of strange. Well,

01:46:34.530 --> 01:46:37.832
Taurus and Cancers are sort
of soul mates of the Zodiac.

01:46:37.897 --> 01:46:41.566
We’re like perfectly compatible,
and I balance what you lack,

01:46:41.582 --> 01:46:43.262
and you make up for what I lack.

01:46:43.308 --> 01:46:48.087
And a quiet Cancer almost
always has a huge penis.

01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:51.502
You’re making me embarra-

01:46:51.635 --> 01:46:53.908
Thank you. Thank you.

01:46:55.382 --> 01:46:57.465
Oh! I wanted to make a toast.

01:46:57.848 --> 01:47:00.877
Thank you guys so much for coming,
thank you so much. Um…

01:47:01.169 --> 01:47:02.729
Pete’s turning forty, and…

01:47:02.863 --> 01:47:04.112
– Weird.
– and,

01:47:04.134 --> 01:47:07.951
we’re ready to start this new
phase of our lives with open hearts.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.529
Ready to just choose joy and…
and forgive everybody.

01:47:12.562 --> 01:47:14.154
So, thank you all for coming.

01:47:14.217 --> 01:47:16.027
– Cheers.
– Wait!

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:17.730
Forgive who?

01:47:17.833 --> 01:47:21.221
Oh I think she just means
in a general sense. You know, just…

01:47:21.779 --> 01:47:23.385
Put the past behind us, and--

01:47:23.426 --> 01:47:24.603
Live without resentments.

01:47:24.647 --> 01:47:27.212
But specifically who are you forgiving?

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:30.410
I just- I just like to know the
details before I make a toast.

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:35.232
Right. You, and…
and my dad and others.

01:47:37.257 --> 01:47:38.412
I see…

01:47:39.501 --> 01:47:42.092
Well I know you- I know you
have some issues with me,

01:47:42.105 --> 01:47:44.139
but I’m curious, what’s he in for?

01:47:44.218 --> 01:47:46.583
Before today, nobody even knew he existed.

01:47:46.624 --> 01:47:48.989
Uh well, my parents divorced
when I was really young and

01:47:49.007 --> 01:47:52.007
we don’t spend that much time
together and I’d like to work on that.

01:47:52.074 --> 01:47:55.899
Just like we’d like to work on…

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.592
how you have financial issues.

01:47:59.776 --> 01:48:02.553
She’s talking about all the lending.
And the borrowing--

01:48:02.589 --> 01:48:04.758
I know what- I know what she meant.

01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.042
You are a beautiful woman,
but you are not totally maxed out.

01:48:10.162 --> 01:48:12.089
I would say honestly, you’re a six.

01:48:12.105 --> 01:48:12.683
– Oh.
– Ooh.

01:48:12.702 --> 01:48:16.067
A six and- six and a half.
I could make you an eleven.

01:48:16.113 --> 01:48:16.832
Really?

01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:18.589
When I found Deb, she was a seven.

01:48:19.113 --> 01:48:20.474
And now she’s a twelve.

01:48:20.508 --> 01:48:22.308
I wanna be a- I wanna be a twelve.

01:48:22.373 --> 01:48:23.248
You can’t be lazy.

01:48:23.295 --> 01:48:24.269
I don’t wanna be lazy.

01:48:24.314 --> 01:48:26.620
Look at me. You cannot be lazy.

01:48:26.675 --> 01:48:28.074
I won’t be lazy.

01:48:28.133 --> 01:48:31.044
Do you know how she got her body?
Bodies By Jason.

01:48:31.157 --> 01:48:32.271
– Wow.
– Say it.

01:48:32.334 --> 01:48:33.449
Bodies By Jason.

01:48:33.511 --> 01:48:34.363
Say it again.

01:48:34.406 --> 01:48:35.699
Bodies By Jason.

01:48:35.753 --> 01:48:36.675
And now just say Jason.

01:48:36.717 --> 01:48:37.542
Jason.

01:48:37.582 --> 01:48:38.782
– Again?
– Jason.

01:48:38.808 --> 01:48:40.624
That sounds right, doesn’t it?

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:41.900
Yeah.

01:48:43.853 --> 01:48:46.038
What the fuck is happening right now?

01:48:47.203 --> 01:48:49.531
When was the last time you two
saw each other, I’m curious?

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:51.255
Actually, we had lunch together last week.

01:48:51.271 --> 01:48:53.068
Uh-huh. And before that?

01:48:53.299 --> 01:48:54.859
It’s been about seven years.

01:48:54.997 --> 01:48:58.734
Seven years? That’s a joke, right?
That’s like two Olympics.

01:48:58.825 --> 01:49:00.213
But I’m the bad guy.

01:49:00.315 --> 01:49:01.158
Right, Dad.

01:49:01.184 --> 01:49:05.604
What Debbie doesn’t understand
is it’s not bad to help out a parent.

01:49:05.761 --> 01:49:09.063
And it’s certainly not bad
for a parent to help out a child.

01:49:09.262 --> 01:49:10.548
I’m sure Oliver would agree.

01:49:10.584 --> 01:49:12.324
– Well, uh--
– Are you really doing this right now?

01:49:12.359 --> 01:49:14.417
Am I doing what?
I didn’t start the toast.

01:49:14.449 --> 01:49:16.696
Are you really about to hit up
my dad for money?

01:49:16.738 --> 01:49:18.892
What? He does four operations a day.

01:49:18.937 --> 01:49:21.704
It’s perfect. It helps everybody,
and it relieves his guilt

01:49:21.722 --> 01:49:23.579
from all the abandonment issues.

01:49:23.636 --> 01:49:26.126
You can’t buy forgiveness, right Pete?

01:49:26.707 --> 01:49:30.847
I don’t think anyone’s looking for
handouts, I mean now we’d… pay him back.

01:49:31.266 --> 01:49:34.443
If you two are in a bind, I-
I’d be more than happy to- to help.

01:49:34.592 --> 01:49:35.712
No.

01:49:35.844 --> 01:49:41.326
It’s not good to borrow money from family
members because it causes resentment.

01:49:41.513 --> 01:49:42.488
Remember?

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.183
Right- yeah yeah,
yeah, yeah.

01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.808
What do- what do you want me to do?

01:49:45.878 --> 01:49:47.761
Okay, admit that my life is shit?

01:49:47.781 --> 01:49:49.508
Is that what you want me
to say? You happy?

01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:53.185
Aren’t I allowed a little joy with
these children I never wanted to have?

01:49:53.716 --> 01:49:56.999
You have never once
stopped asking us for money.

01:49:57.130 --> 01:49:59.234
Family helps family.

01:49:59.313 --> 01:50:01.781
But it’s true. Family helps family.

01:50:01.976 --> 01:50:04.848
Look, I don’t expect you
to fully understand.

01:50:04.899 --> 01:50:07.287
You- your dad left.
You’re broken inside.

01:50:07.288 --> 01:50:09.618
It’s not your fault you can’t feel love.

01:50:09.746 --> 01:50:11.439
There’s something that you can’t--

01:50:12.722 --> 01:50:14.522
This is coming out wrong.

01:50:15.217 --> 01:50:17.331
You know what? I would rather have my dad

01:50:17.342 --> 01:50:18.988
– Mm-hmm.
– than your dad,

01:50:19.147 --> 01:50:21.027
because he doesn’t drive me crazy.

01:50:21.138 --> 01:50:23.191
You know the best quality my father has?

01:50:23.366 --> 01:50:25.121
Is he asks for nothing.

01:50:26.341 --> 01:50:29.043
I don’t know what the fuck
he’s thinking right now.

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.307
Look at that.
Nothing. Nothing.

01:50:32.431 --> 01:50:37.475
I don’t even know him. And I turned out
perfectly fine without his input. Okay?

01:50:37.584 --> 01:50:41.745
I just figured out what your problem is.

01:50:42.238 --> 01:50:43.837
You hate Jews!

01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:47.235
Which is so odd because
your children are Jewish.

01:50:47.262 --> 01:50:48.728
Don’t play the Jew card, Larry.

01:50:48.755 --> 01:50:49.853
I’m not playing any Jew card.

01:50:49.874 --> 01:50:51.231
Seriously, it’s used up.

01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:54.114
You can’t use up a Jew card.
That’s the whole point of a Jew card.

01:50:54.130 --> 01:50:57.010
That’s right. You can’t
use it up, it goes forever.

01:50:57.036 --> 01:50:59.495
Uh, you- you know what? I- I have to go.

01:50:59.544 --> 01:51:01.338
Yeah. Great. What a big surprise.

01:51:01.393 --> 01:51:04.719
Bye Oliver! See you later!
See you in another seven years.

01:51:04.754 --> 01:51:07.259
Make sure to say goodbye to
the grandkids, who you met today.

01:51:07.325 --> 01:51:10.325
You know, nothing I do is right
because of you? Nothing.

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:13.832
No matter how hard I try, I’m just
the asshole here, but you know what?

01:51:13.930 --> 01:51:16.330
You know what I realized?
It’s you. You’re the asshole.

01:51:17.745 --> 01:51:19.242
Good luck working that out.

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:22.102
Happy birthday and go fuck yourself.

01:51:22.719 --> 01:51:25.119
Hey! See you when
the Cubs win the Pennant.

01:51:25.962 --> 01:51:28.318
I’m gonna light the candles.
Just get it going, okay?

01:51:30.008 --> 01:51:32.716
– Maybe we should try the toast again.
– You know, can you be quiet?

01:51:33.173 --> 01:51:34.626
You just threw me under the bus.

01:51:34.627 --> 01:51:35.446
You just threw me under the bus.
– No. I don’t understa--

01:51:35.454 --> 01:51:38.470
You threw me under the-
You threw me under the bus!

01:51:38.508 --> 01:51:40.623
You know we agreed to
let go and forgive,

01:51:40.638 --> 01:51:43.544
but then you started ripping
into my dad like a crazy person.

01:51:43.628 --> 01:51:45.117
I’m not ripping into your dad!

01:51:45.150 --> 01:51:48.805
I’m just saying to him
what you say to me.

01:51:48.829 --> 01:51:50.295
Don’t be such a ball buster.

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:52.080
I am not a ball buster.

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:54.939
You make me one! I am a fun girl!

01:51:54.996 --> 01:51:58.454
I am funloving! I am a good time Sally!

01:51:58.591 --> 01:52:03.467
I dance hip-hop! I cannot believe
I have wasted my whole life

01:52:03.526 --> 01:52:06.751
busting the balls of people
who have no balls.

01:52:07.050 --> 01:52:09.922
I am the only one here who has any balls!

01:52:10.563 --> 01:52:13.849

Mom?

Mom! What are you doing?

01:53:03.321 --> 01:53:04.222
What?

01:53:04.255 --> 01:53:06.596
You’re smoking?
In- in the front yard?

01:53:06.679 --> 01:53:09.442
No! No. They’re Barb’s.

01:53:11.953 --> 01:53:13.073
Mom!

01:53:13.134 --> 01:53:15.280
Since when have you been a smoker?

01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:16.296
I’m not a smoker.

01:53:16.342 --> 01:53:17.796
I thought you said smokers die.

01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:20.263
I’m not smoking.
I wasn’t smoking.

01:53:20.314 --> 01:53:21.311
I saw you!

01:53:21.335 --> 01:53:22.077
No, I wasn’t.

01:53:22.085 --> 01:53:23.718
Mom, you’re smoking?

01:53:23.728 --> 01:53:26.952
Deb, you can’t smoke, you’re pregnant.
You’ve been doing so well.

01:53:26.976 --> 01:53:28.378
You’re pregnant?

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.569
No F-ing way.
I don’t want another sister!

01:53:30.618 --> 01:53:32.468
I don’t want her as a sister.

01:53:32.492 --> 01:53:34.794
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
It just slipped out.

01:53:34.810 --> 01:53:36.732
Are you really pregn-
Since when’re you pregnant?

01:53:36.739 --> 01:53:39.924
Since when do you care?
You didn’t want another baby!

01:53:39.935 --> 01:53:41.370
You have no idea what I want.

01:53:41.397 --> 01:53:42.801
I want an Asian baby.

01:53:42.822 --> 01:53:44.332
We’re not gonna have an Asian baby!

01:53:44.347 --> 01:53:45.480
Yes, we are!

01:53:45.493 --> 01:53:46.558
They’re not Asian.

01:53:46.567 --> 01:53:47.928
– Sadie!
– We’ll buy one.

01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:48.787
Shut up, Charlotte.

01:53:48.803 --> 01:53:49.420
You shut up!

01:53:49.441 --> 01:53:50.443
Shut up, Sadie!

01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:51.443
Shut up, Charlotte!

01:53:51.459 --> 01:53:52.926
– Shut up!
– Okay, Sadie. Shut up!

01:53:52.936 --> 01:53:54.278
Shut up, Charlotte!

01:53:54.309 --> 01:53:56.043
– Shut up!
– Okay, stop saying shut up!

01:53:56.077 --> 01:53:58.077
You’re pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

01:53:58.116 --> 01:53:59.426
When did you find out?

01:54:01.523 --> 01:54:05.028
Will you stop eating cupcakes, please!

01:54:05.255 --> 01:54:06.979
Stop eating cupcakes!

01:54:07.511 --> 01:54:09.604
Stop eating cupcakes!!

01:54:13.215 --> 01:54:16.814
Hey! We just heard!
You’re having a baby!

01:54:17.442 --> 01:54:19.088
See, it can happen to anybody.

01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:20.956
That is so wonderful.

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:22.636
Let me get the-
oh, it’s fantastic.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:24.415
Congratulations.
– Oh, it’s wonderful.

01:54:24.433 --> 01:54:25.907
So happy for you.

01:54:26.814 --> 01:54:28.173
Get the other kid.

01:54:28.423 --> 01:54:29.626
– I thought you have?
– I never have.

01:54:29.713 --> 01:54:31.913
This is too adult for you.
Let’s go outside.

01:54:31.968 --> 01:54:33.788
Congratulations.

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:38.084
Well, I guess we’re stuck together
then forever, then, right?

01:54:38.115 --> 01:54:39.390
Weren’t we always?

01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:40.687
You don’t even want a baby!

01:54:40.727 --> 01:54:42.592
Of course I do. I never said that.

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:45.146
Look, I ju- I didn’t want
one if I could choose.

01:54:45.193 --> 01:54:47.724
I should put that on a Hallmark card.
That’s beautiful.

01:54:47.776 --> 01:54:48.972
Debbie…

01:54:49.139 --> 01:54:52.139
Uh, good luck with the pregnancy,
Debbie. But please…

01:54:52.522 --> 01:54:55.668
take care of yourself. It’s a much
riskier pregnancy after forty.

01:54:55.856 --> 01:54:56.838
I’m not forty.

01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:00.392
Of course you are. You
were born on December 5th, 1972.

01:55:00.414 --> 01:55:02.794
I’m not forty! Ho- How do you know?

01:55:02.819 --> 01:55:06.013
I was there! I’m the one who
took your mother to the hospital.

01:55:06.037 --> 01:55:07.417
Well that’s not what she said.

01:55:07.423 --> 01:55:09.913
Yeah, your mom was in labor for
only twenty minutes.

01:55:09.922 --> 01:55:12.922
You cou- so you couldn’t wait
to meet me, can you imagine that?

01:55:12.977 --> 01:55:14.506
I don’t even know you.

01:55:14.632 --> 01:55:18.748
You can’t just come into
my house and reminisce.

01:55:18.764 --> 01:55:22.152
Look, maybe we were just not meant
to be in each other’s lives.

01:55:22.261 --> 01:55:24.777
I’m not sure this was such a great idea.

01:55:28.336 --> 01:55:30.312
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.

01:55:30.809 --> 01:55:33.853
You did leave. And you didn’t come back.

01:55:33.898 --> 01:55:37.507
My first life was ruined.
I did my best with my second.

01:55:37.533 --> 01:55:40.062
So I ruined your life?
I was eight.

01:55:40.167 --> 01:55:43.663
People do better when I stay out of
their lives! That’s what my son tells me.

01:55:43.792 --> 01:55:45.274
You think my life is so perfect?

01:55:45.288 --> 01:55:49.625
I’ve got a- a thirteen-year old who’s a
pot head, I’ve got a wife who’s- who’s-

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:52.210
who’s keeping Zoloft alive!

01:55:52.368 --> 01:55:53.858
You never said that before.

01:55:53.893 --> 01:55:56.936
You don’t think I wanna talk to you
about this? To share it with you?

01:55:56.967 --> 01:56:00.628
It’s just not our way! We don’t talk to
each other, we don’t know each other.

01:56:00.748 --> 01:56:02.753
And I thought that’s
the way you wanted it.

01:56:02.816 --> 01:56:04.416
How- how- how do I get out of this?

01:56:04.448 --> 01:56:08.486
How do I get you all to just
help me down off the cross?

01:56:10.462 --> 01:56:11.976
You sound just like Sadie.

01:56:12.027 --> 01:56:13.173
Who’s Sadie?

01:56:13.284 --> 01:56:15.970
No. Your daughter. Your younger?

01:56:16.054 --> 01:56:16.837
The big one.

01:56:16.894 --> 01:56:20.684
Your older. I know- I know that!
A wonderful girl.

01:56:21.012 --> 01:56:23.994
Hey, guys. Some of us need to leave.

01:56:24.057 --> 01:56:26.501
Would this be a good moment to sneak out?

01:56:30.346 --> 01:56:32.146
Where’s Dad going?

01:56:42.063 --> 01:56:44.390
Best birthday ever!

01:56:51.035 --> 01:56:51.704
Oh shit!

01:56:51.735 --> 01:56:52.946
Bike lane, asshole!

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:56.689
Fuck you, you Twilight
pimply-ass motherfuckers!

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.828
Your dad’s still here.

01:56:59.764 --> 01:57:02.066
I know. It’s kind of weird.

01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:03.909
Where the hell is Pete?

01:57:05.302 --> 01:57:06.422
Uhm…

01:57:06.838 --> 01:57:09.838
Is it okay if Joseph
hangs out here for a while?

01:57:10.163 --> 01:57:11.283
Mm-hmm.

01:57:13.073 --> 01:57:14.398
Hi, Joseph.

01:57:14.826 --> 01:57:16.026
Hi.

01:57:16.674 --> 01:57:17.898
Do you want a piece of cake?

01:57:18.016 --> 01:57:18.985
Oh! Yeah sure.

01:57:20.243 --> 01:57:21.733
Thank you. Thanks.

01:57:23.938 --> 01:57:25.404
All right, then.

01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:27.123
They are so cute.

01:57:27.124 --> 01:57:28.187
So cute…

01:57:28.239 --> 01:57:29.734
He looks exactly like Tom Petty.

01:57:36.326 --> 01:57:37.886
Go around!

01:57:40.735 --> 01:57:42.444
Watch it! Watch it!!

01:57:46.796 --> 01:57:48.950
Hey, Pete. Great party!

01:57:51.567 --> 01:57:52.760
Yeah.

01:57:53.718 --> 01:57:55.041
The best!

01:57:55.822 --> 01:57:57.262
And then you shake it.

01:57:58.051 --> 01:57:59.788
And then a restaurant comes up.

01:58:00.093 --> 01:58:03.520
D- Dad? Excuse me. I’m gonna
go look for Pete right now.

01:58:03.615 --> 01:58:06.754
Would you mind staying
with girls for just a little bit?

01:58:06.891 --> 01:58:08.159
Well, if you want me to.

01:58:08.239 --> 01:58:09.894
If you don’t mind.
You don’t have to.

01:58:09.995 --> 01:58:11.115
Sure.

01:58:12.536 --> 01:58:15.065
Can I let Sadie show me
the last episode of Lost?

01:58:15.089 --> 01:58:16.690
She asked me if I’d seen it, I haven’t.

01:58:16.714 --> 01:58:18.336
Yeah, that would be nice.

01:58:19.446 --> 01:58:20.787
Thank you.
– Thank you.

01:58:21.827 --> 01:58:23.707
She said we could watch it.
Come on!

01:58:26.056 --> 01:58:27.928
I’m gonna let you watch Lost.

01:58:28.094 --> 01:58:28.897
Come on.

01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:31.969
Is it scary?

01:58:31.991 --> 01:58:34.348
I’ll cover your eyes if it gets too scary.

01:59:06.215 --> 01:59:08.399
Are you mad at me?
Did I say something?

01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:10.063
Shh. Larry, please.

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:26.176
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.447
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:59:30.494 --> 01:59:32.294
You opened your door on me.

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:35.291
I didn’t open my fucking door
on you. I opened my door!

01:59:35.361 --> 01:59:37.721
Ah! Fuck, I was right there!

01:59:37.979 --> 01:59:39.995
You’re supposed to look
before you open your door,

01:59:40.009 --> 01:59:41.425
I was in the fucking bike path.

01:59:41.449 --> 01:59:44.657
That’s a blind spot. There’s no fucking
bike path. This is a residential section.

01:59:44.691 --> 01:59:46.110
Get your head out of your ass.

01:59:46.129 --> 01:59:46.931
Pay attention!

01:59:46.938 --> 01:59:48.845
Open your god damn eyes.
What are you doing, sleepwalking?

01:59:48.861 --> 01:59:52.210
You’re supposed to look
to see if a biker is coming through.

01:59:52.288 --> 01:59:53.249
You’re supposed to look!

01:59:53.261 --> 01:59:55.743
It’s not my job to look out for you.
You look out for yourself!

01:59:55.759 --> 01:59:57.726
I don’t look out for you. I don’t see you.

01:59:57.766 --> 01:59:59.883
I don’t know where the fuck
you are and what you’re doing!

01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:02.300
No one is ever looking out for me!

02:00:02.449 --> 02:00:04.649
I need your name and number.

02:00:04.798 --> 02:00:05.709
Why?

02:00:05.742 --> 02:00:07.192
’Cause you’re gonna pay for my door.

02:00:07.219 --> 02:00:08.030
Fuck you!

02:00:08.076 --> 02:00:11.753
Why don’t you pay for my bike,
and my face, you fucking prick!

02:00:18.798 --> 02:00:20.213
Don’t disrespect me.

02:00:23.012 --> 02:00:24.603
Are you sure that’s him?

02:00:25.057 --> 02:00:26.644
I don’t think that’s him!

02:00:29.369 --> 02:00:31.523
I’m gonna write down
your license plate.

02:00:36.274 --> 02:00:39.084
“Range Rover of Sunland.”

02:00:42.381 --> 02:00:43.000
What are you doing?

02:00:43.001 --> 02:00:44.501
What are you doing?
– Ow.

02:00:51.247 --> 02:00:54.440
I guess the party didn’t
turn out like you planned.

02:00:55.849 --> 02:00:57.768
It wasn’t a good party.

02:00:58.972 --> 02:00:59.987
– Hi.
– Hi.

02:01:00.005 --> 02:01:01.784
I’ll bring you in as soon as
his x-rays are finished.

02:01:01.805 --> 02:01:02.779
– Okay.
– Okay.

02:01:02.824 --> 02:01:03.568
Is he okay?

02:01:03.635 --> 02:01:07.687
Yeah, he has a broken rib and he’s been
crying a little bit, but he’ll be fine.

02:01:10.156 --> 02:01:14.325
You know Pete was never a real fighter.

02:01:15.452 --> 02:01:19.613
But that’s why he married you. That’s why
he loves you. ’Cause you’re the fighter.

02:01:20.512 --> 02:01:24.588
And you need that. One person
in a relationship has got to punch.

02:01:25.347 --> 02:01:26.930
Do you mean that in a good way?

02:01:26.982 --> 02:01:30.008
Oh, it’s a… it’s a high compliment.

02:01:32.281 --> 02:01:33.513
Thanks.

02:01:34.982 --> 02:01:36.995
Listen, I know what you’re worried about.

02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:39.261
You think he’s gonna turn into me, but…

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.930
I don’t think it’s gonna happen.

02:01:41.987 --> 02:01:44.813
He’s smarter and
probably a little cuter.

02:01:46.236 --> 02:01:47.620
A little less Jewy.

02:01:48.268 --> 02:01:51.586
Although after fifty, that’s
all gonna change.

02:01:51.618 --> 02:01:54.445
Be prepared to wake up
one day with a a rabbi.

02:01:55.568 --> 02:01:57.722
But the good news is, you know…

02:01:59.142 --> 02:02:02.155
he’ll love you forever.
That’s in our DNA.

02:02:02.645 --> 02:02:04.445
We stick around.

02:02:05.845 --> 02:02:09.538
He worries about you, you know.
It puts a lot of pressure on him.

02:02:09.649 --> 02:02:12.444
I know. I just- I don’t have
anyone else to talk to about it.

02:02:12.469 --> 02:02:13.880
Why don’t you talk to Claire?

02:02:13.933 --> 02:02:15.946
Oh, if I open up to her, she’ll leave me.

02:02:15.974 --> 02:02:17.923
– No, she won’t.
– Hmm.

02:02:17.978 --> 02:02:18.940
Larry, she loves you.

02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:22.580
Ι knоw, but thеrе’ѕ а сеrtаіn
роіnt аt whісh yоu јuѕt саn’t ѕtаy.

02:02:27.144 --> 02:02:31.704
I guess it’s hard to forgive somebody
if they don’t formally apologize to you.

02:02:35.536 --> 02:02:37.387
Are you apologizing?

02:02:37.709 --> 02:02:39.732
I’m very close.

02:02:42.042 --> 02:02:43.941
Yes, I’m- I’m- I’m sorry.

02:02:49.494 --> 02:02:51.656
I’m glad everybody’s okay.

02:02:53.686 --> 02:02:55.824
Oh. Thank you.

02:03:02.452 --> 02:03:04.012
Alright. I’m off.

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:05.243
Okay.

02:03:06.978 --> 02:03:08.538
This is awkward.

02:03:09.155 --> 02:03:10.093
What?

02:03:10.269 --> 02:03:12.669
I need forty dollars for a cab.

02:03:13.904 --> 02:03:15.308
That’s funny.

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:17.151
No, I’m not kidding.

02:03:18.747 --> 02:03:20.994
You drove me. I- I wasn’t prepared.

02:03:21.604 --> 02:03:23.104
I only have a hundred.

02:03:23.135 --> 02:03:24.429
It’s okay.

02:03:24.928 --> 02:03:26.515
I’ll bring you the change.

02:03:27.703 --> 02:03:30.103
All right, give him a kiss for me.

02:03:48.274 --> 02:03:50.732
I- I- I don’t get it.

02:03:51.929 --> 02:03:56.708
See, it’s not sad, it’s happy because they
helped each other achieve their destiny.

02:03:56.731 --> 02:03:57.931
Oh.

02:03:58.181 --> 02:04:02.475
Great. I’m gonna have
some freaky ass nightmares.

02:04:14.436 --> 02:04:15.449
Hi.

02:04:15.623 --> 02:04:16.715
Hi.

02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:30.407
I really liked our lives so much better
before we tried to change everything.

02:04:31.203 --> 02:04:32.654
I’m sorry.

02:04:32.951 --> 02:04:34.558
No. I’m sorry.

02:04:34.902 --> 02:04:37.355
I don’t wanna keep anything from you.

02:04:38.231 --> 02:04:39.931
I love you. You’re my wife.

02:04:40.365 --> 02:04:42.098
I just didn’t want to let you down.

02:04:44.151 --> 02:04:45.812
Are you mad that I’m pregnant?

02:04:45.972 --> 02:04:48.819
No. I’m not mad. I’m thrilled.

02:04:49.099 --> 02:04:50.452
You don’t feel trapped?

02:04:51.085 --> 02:04:53.151
Sometimes I feel like I trapped you.

02:04:53.188 --> 02:04:54.502
I don’t feel trapped.

02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:56.070
– Really?
– No.

02:04:56.544 --> 02:04:58.385
You should, because I’ve trapped you.

02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.940
You can’t go anywhere.

02:05:00.653 --> 02:05:03.447
I’m gonna get you pregnant every
ten years for the rest of your life.

02:05:03.455 --> 02:05:05.666
You can never leave me. Ever.

02:05:05.709 --> 02:05:08.488
I never feel trapped by you.
I’m so happy to be with you.

02:05:08.490 --> 02:05:13.831
And I love you so much. You’re my
favorite person in the whole world.

02:05:14.366 --> 02:05:19.415
God damn it, why am I crying like this?
Something is wrong with me.

02:05:19.490 --> 02:05:20.823
You’re pregnant.

02:05:20.949 --> 02:05:22.069
Oh, yeah.

02:05:22.558 --> 02:05:23.678
Shit.

02:05:24.136 --> 02:05:27.416
I was just outside telling
your dad that I liked him.

02:05:27.462 --> 02:05:28.999
What if he thinks I like him now?

02:05:29.028 --> 02:05:30.319
No, he won’t think that.

02:05:30.391 --> 02:05:32.437
I don’t want him to think
I like him that much.

02:05:32.476 --> 02:05:34.276
No, it’ll never happen.

02:05:35.026 --> 02:05:38.734
Can you believe it?
This is the craziest thing ever.

02:05:38.766 --> 02:05:41.359
What are we gonna do with a third baby?

02:05:41.388 --> 02:05:44.272
I have no idea.
How are we gonna afford it?

02:05:44.584 --> 02:05:46.046
We’ll sell the house.

02:05:46.259 --> 02:05:47.545
We don’t have to.

02:05:47.577 --> 02:05:49.264
– We kind of do.
– We kind of do.

02:05:49.546 --> 02:05:51.946
We’ll make new memories in a new house.

02:05:52.524 --> 02:05:54.084
I love you.

02:05:55.873 --> 02:05:58.230
Is there anything you
wanna do for your birthday?

02:05:58.761 --> 02:06:00.831
It’s been the worst birthday ever.

02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.006
There is one thing, but
I don’t think you’ll like it.

02:06:04.118 --> 02:06:05.092
What?

02:06:05.607 --> 02:06:07.667
I wouldn’t mind going to see some music.

02:06:08.013 --> 02:06:09.120
Would you want to do that?

02:06:09.130 --> 02:06:09.972
Yeah.

02:06:10.035 --> 02:06:11.136
– Really?
– Yeah.

02:06:11.253 --> 02:06:14.037
I don’t believe you,
but you’re sweet for saying that.

02:06:14.088 --> 02:06:15.686
How do we break you out of here?

02:06:15.902 --> 02:06:18.772
I can just leave on my own volition.
It’s not a mental institution.

02:06:18.818 --> 02:06:20.261
– Can you?
– Yeah.

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:22.765
It’s not like One Flew
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.

02:06:23.251 --> 02:06:25.039
Please don’t put a pillow over my face.

02:06:27.281 --> 02:06:28.747
Let’s get out of here, McMurphy.

02:06:28.806 --> 02:06:31.302
You got it, Chief.
Will you carry me?

02:06:32.624 --> 02:06:34.957
You’ve been carrying me up all this time.

02:07:14.448 --> 02:07:16.056
I like this song.

02:07:16.625 --> 02:07:17.825
Really?

02:07:18.575 --> 02:07:19.994
Why?

02:07:24.745 --> 02:07:26.297
Why don’t you sign him?

02:07:26.418 --> 02:07:28.454
Ryan Adams? No, he’s…

02:07:29.275 --> 02:07:30.614
He wouldn’t sign with me.

02:07:30.648 --> 02:07:32.448
Why not? You’re the best.

02:07:32.815 --> 02:07:34.476
He is in between labels.

02:07:36.409 --> 02:07:38.587
Let’s go try and talk
to him after the show.
