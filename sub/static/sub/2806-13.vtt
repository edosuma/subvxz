00:04.754 --> 00:07.006
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Hi.

00:07.173 --> 00:10.426
Well, you know, I was thinking
of moving the couch over here.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.011
Why would you want to do that?

00:12.220 --> 00:14.638
So that there would be a decent place
for me to sit?

00:16.056 --> 00:20.185
- Rach, there is a decent place.
- And your lap does not count.

00:22.063 --> 00:24.815
- Okay? Come on, help me move this.
- No, no, no.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.275
- No?
- No.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.193
Rosita does not move.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.741
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?

00:33.908 --> 00:36.243
As in "Rosita does not move."

00:36.411 --> 00:38.620
Joey, it's just a chair.
What's the big deal?

00:38.788 --> 00:42.541
The big deal is that it's the exact equal
distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...

00:42.709 --> 00:47.629
...and it's at the perfect angle so you
don't get any glare coming off of Stevie.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.090
Stevie the TV?

00:52.469 --> 00:54.636
- Is there a problem?
- No.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.099
Oh, what does he know?

00:59.267 --> 01:02.352
Come on, Rosita.
Us chicas gotta stick together.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.775
Ow!

01:11.112 --> 01:13.238
You bitch.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.029
Hey, Ross?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.198
So I was checking out
the real-estate section.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.659
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.661
Oh, looks like Mom and Dad's house.

02:00.829 --> 02:04.081
Oh, it even has a tree
with a broken limb out front.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.709
And the, uh, window in the attic...

02:08.586 --> 02:10.795
Oh, my God.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.258
What? What happened
to the window in the attic?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.969
I can't believe Mom and Dad
are selling the house.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.929
I can't believe they didn't even tell us.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.391
I can't believe I still don't know
what happened to the window in the attic.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.894
Okay, come on.
I'll buy you a new one, all right?

02:26.062 --> 02:29.356
We'll go down to the store right now
and we'll get you a new chair.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.112
She's not even cold yet.

02:36.948 --> 02:39.992
But don't you think Rosita
would've wanted you to move on?

02:40.160 --> 02:44.788
I mean, you know, she did always
put your comfort first.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.375
That's true.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.003
Wow.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.592
I can't believe we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.636
Man, some stranger's
gonna be living in my room.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.265
Well, after 15 years of Mom and Dad
keeping it as a shrine to you...

03:03.433 --> 03:05.809
...it's time the velvet ropes came down.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.228
They kept your room a while.

03:08.521 --> 03:13.192
Oh, please. Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

03:13.359 --> 03:17.529
And I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.989
Not a gym.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.202
- Come on. You know they love you.
- As much as they love you?

03:23.369 --> 03:27.539
I was their firstborn. They thought
she was barren. It's not my fault.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.586
Ugh. I hate this year.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.504
What's wrong with this year?

03:34.672 --> 03:37.424
It's already February
and I've only given two massages...

03:37.592 --> 03:40.510
...and they were both
the worst tippers in the world.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.137
That was me and Ross.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.433
Oh, that's right.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.769
If you want to pick up some extra cash...

03:48.937 --> 03:52.481
...some friends of mine made good money
in college doing telemarketing.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.150
Yeah, it'd probably be better
than the last telephone job I had.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.195
You know, I probably won't have to say
"spank" as much.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.575
What?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.870
Oh, yeah, like you never called.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.588
So, basically, this is very easy.
You read from the script...

04:16.755 --> 04:19.341
...and try to sell as much toner
as you possibly can.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.218
Okay, I can do that.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.846
- Oh, by the way, I love my office.
- Ha, ha.

04:25.014 --> 04:28.141
- Why don't we do a trial run?
- Oh, okay.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.687
Um, all right.

04:32.146 --> 04:35.023
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.317
Can I speak to your supply manager,
please?

04:37.485 --> 04:39.069
I'm the supply manager.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.488
Um, okay. I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.866
- We don't need any toner.
- Well, I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.661
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.580
Okay. What was wrong with that call?

04:50.748 --> 04:52.291
Oh, well, all right.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.919
Um, no offense,
but you were kind of rude.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.424
They're always gonna tell you
they don't need toner, but that's okay.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.967
Because whatever they say...

05:02.135 --> 05:04.386
...you can find the answer to it,
here in the script.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.723
- Oh.
- So I think you're ready to sell toner.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.142
- Do you have any last questions?
- No.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.894
Oh, wait, yes, I do.
I do have one question:

05:13.062 --> 05:14.313
What is toner?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.109
Joey?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.404
Joe?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.744
Full bag?

05:30.121 --> 05:32.706
Beer's still cold.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.169
Something terrible
must have happened here.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.429
Oh, no, no, no.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.060
Stevie, I was never here.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.691
- Dad?
- I'm here.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.818
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:01.986 --> 06:06.323
God, it seems like just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.867
Dad, we can't believe
you're selling the house.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.244
It's time for a new family
to start their memories here.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.456
And hopefully their check will clear
before they find the crack...

06:14.624 --> 06:17.459
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiling.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.339
Let's just grab our stuff
and get the hell out of here.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.342
I'm sorry we can't store
your childhood things anymore.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.720
Oh, it's okay. I can't wait to see
everything again. All the memories.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.806
I don't know what's in the boxes
down here.

06:30.973 --> 06:34.726
But I do know that there are six or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.771
I used to love to play restaurant.

06:37.939 --> 06:41.066
Yeah, not as much as you loved to play
"uncooked batter eater."

06:41.317 --> 06:46.655
Hey. It is unreasonable to expect a child
to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.118
So I think your boxes are over here.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.536
Oh, great.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.454
Hey...

06:54.622 --> 06:56.665
...Dad, whose cigarettes are these?

06:58.835 --> 07:00.335
I don't know.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.713
They must be your mother's.

07:03.881 --> 07:08.427
But please, please don't ask her.
I'll throw these away.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.559
Cool. Dad, my report cards.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.394
Hey, check this out. Dad.

07:17.562 --> 07:22.899
Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym...

07:28.281 --> 07:31.575
Ooh, my rock polisher.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.038
- Uh-oh.
- What?

07:37.248 --> 07:39.749
You know how the garage
floods every spring?

07:40.042 --> 07:43.086
How are you ever gonna sell this place?

07:43.546 --> 07:46.173
I think I accidentally
used Monica's boxes...

07:46.340 --> 07:48.800
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.806
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.183
What the...?

07:56.350 --> 07:58.185
Oh, God.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.562
Everything's ruined.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.023
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.985
You don't secretly smoke, do you?

08:08.946 --> 08:10.405
No.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.616
So it's just your mother, then.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.498
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.709
Can I speak to your
supply manager, please?

08:23.878 --> 08:25.712
Earl. Thanks.

08:26.547 --> 08:30.550
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.428
I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.097
I don't need any toner.

08:37.099 --> 08:41.811
I'm hearing what you're saying,
but at our prices, everyone needs toner.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.897
Not me.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.775
May I ask why?

08:47.109 --> 08:51.571
You want to know why?

08:51.739 --> 08:53.573
I surely do.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.408
Okay.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.954
I don't need any toner...

08:59.121 --> 09:00.997
...because I'm gonna kill myself.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.343
Um...

09:13.886 --> 09:16.721
Is that because you're out of toner?

09:20.935 --> 09:26.314
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.568
No, no, wait, wait.
I can't just let you hang up.

09:29.735 --> 09:30.902
Just please talk to me.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.904
Well...

09:33.864 --> 09:35.782
I only had one thing to do today.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.621
I guess I could push it back.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.208
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kill yourself?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.838
I've been working for 10 years
now at this...

09:50.006 --> 09:52.132
...meaningless, dead-end job...

09:52.300 --> 09:55.218
...and nobody here
even knows that I exist.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.138
Chandler?

10:02.476 --> 10:04.603
I'm sorry?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.689
Oh. Look...

10:07.857 --> 10:10.525
...I'm sure that people know you exist.

10:10.693 --> 10:14.154
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle
surrounded by people.

10:14.905 --> 10:19.117
I've been talking to you
for five minutes now about killing myself...

10:19.327 --> 10:22.579
...and no one's even looked up
from their desk. Hang on.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.581
Hey, everybody, uh...

10:24.749 --> 10:26.875
...I'm gonna kill myself.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.297
I got nothing.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.552
Good chair.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.512
Now, if anybody asks...

10:39.680 --> 10:42.557
...your name is Rosita.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.667
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.921
Joey, the new chair
will be here in an hour.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.882
Maybe we should actually
move Rosita out of here, you know?

11:16.050 --> 11:18.218
Start the healing process.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.929
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Okay.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.536
She's healed.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.042
- That's weird.
- No, it's not weird.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.044
It's a miracle.

11:54.171 --> 11:57.257
It's not a miracle, Joey.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.009
There is. If you want something enough
and your heart is pure...

12:00.177 --> 12:01.511
...wondrous things can happen.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.100
Well, she'll understand, right?
It's not like I did it on purpose.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.852
Dad, that won't matter to her.

12:09.019 --> 12:13.148
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.
And all her stuff is...

12:13.315 --> 12:16.359
...growing new stuff.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.319
See, this is exactly the kind of thing...

12:18.487 --> 12:21.448
...that makes her think
you guys love me more than you love her.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.616
Oh, my God. Does she really think that?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.243
Well, can you blame her?

12:25.411 --> 12:28.747
I don't know. I suppose
we may have favored you unconsciously.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.248
You were a medical marvel.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.293
- The doctors said your mom couldn't...
- I don't want to hear about it.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.171
- Really?
- Well, not right now.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.174
Okay, look.
Monica came here for some memories.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.134
Damn it, we're gonna give her some.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.927
Okay, grab...

12:43.095 --> 12:46.014
Grab some empty boxes, okay?
We'll take stuff from mine...

12:46.182 --> 12:49.934
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'll put them in there.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.855
- Right.
- Like, this. She could have made this.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.316
- This could have been hers.
- Sure.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.322
You know, if you want to tell
the medical marvel story while we work...

13:02.490 --> 13:04.032
...that'd be fine.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.331
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myself.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.253
Yeah. Me too.

13:19.715 --> 13:23.218
Wow, you know, that this thing
has speakers in the headrest?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.346
- No, really?
- Yeah.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.015
You can hook it up to your TV
and you get radio.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.731
My chair heals itself.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.320
All right. Earl, let's just forget about
the people at the office, okay?

13:42.488 --> 13:46.199
There's gotta be someone else in your life
that's worth sticking around for.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.203
What about your family or friends?
Or maybe a girlfriend?

13:50.371 --> 13:52.247
Heh. Yeah, right.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.541
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

13:55.751 --> 13:57.043
Okay, I should...

13:57.211 --> 13:59.838
I should probably be getting back
to my thing now.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.464
- See you.
- No.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.467
I'm not finished yet.
Don't you dare hang up on me!

14:05.386 --> 14:07.387
The new girl's good.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.850
So which boxes are mine?

14:12.017 --> 14:15.061
- These are yours right here.
- Okay.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.982
- Oh, a coloring book.
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, you loved that thing.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.110
You always had it with you.
You never went anywhere without...

14:22.278 --> 14:23.903
Without that coloring book.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.363
Really?

14:25.531 --> 14:28.199
Wow. Looks like I had some trouble
staying inside the lines.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.451
Uh-uh.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.829
Wow, look at this.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.665
I can't believe I even fit into this shirt.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.880
Oh, this is yours.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.632
I don't know how that got in there.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.595
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

14:48.762 --> 14:52.223
Ross, these are your boxes.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.395
Where are my boxes?

14:58.397 --> 15:01.983
The garage flooded, sweetie,
and it ruined everything in your boxes.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.526
I'm sorry.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.821
- Just mine?
- I'm afraid so.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.366
So why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

15:11.118 --> 15:14.913
I used your boxes to divert
water away from the Porsche.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.916
So wait. Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

15:18.083 --> 15:21.044
...because you wanted to keep the
bottom two inches of your car from water?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.838
Well, there was also leaves
and gook and stuff.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.092
I can't believe this.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.143
Screw it. I'm having one.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.900
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.445
How would you like to sit
in a chair that fully reclines...

15:47.613 --> 15:49.739
...has a rolling massage...

15:49.907 --> 15:52.200
...and speakers in the headrest?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.619
Yeah, I'd love to,
but I've tried that so many times...

15:54.787 --> 15:57.538
...they won't even let me
in the store anymore.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.377
Well, what if I told you
that you could do it in my apartment?

16:02.544 --> 16:03.878
Are you telling me...

16:04.046 --> 16:07.548
...that you bought the chair that is making
all other lounge systems obsolete?

16:07.716 --> 16:12.428
The chair that Sit Magazine
called "Chair of the Year"?

16:14.223 --> 16:15.390
I just purchased...

16:15.557 --> 16:19.686
...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.188
Well, that's awesome. That's great.
What made you do it?

16:22.356 --> 16:25.358
Well, it's a long story,
but I broke Joey's chair...

16:25.526 --> 16:28.277
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

16:28.445 --> 16:30.196
- Yeah.
- I thought I broke Joey's chair.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.491
- That's why I replaced it with mine.
- Oh.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.994
That's how it got fixed.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.539
Well, what did you think?
That elves came in and fixed it?

16:39.748 --> 16:41.332
No.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.126
Angels.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.338
- I'm getting my chair back.
- Hey.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.802
Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.681
So I guess this chair's mine now.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.602
Joey, you broke my chair!

17:01.770 --> 17:02.812
Your chair?

17:02.980 --> 17:06.023
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair,
so he switched the chairs.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.861
- So there was no miracle?
- No, Joe. No miracle.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.195
Oh, no. This is devastating.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.032
My faith is shaken.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.411
I'm so glad I have the new chair to get me
through this difficult time in my life.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.458
Excuse me, could you tell me
where can I find Earl?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.209
He's the supply manager here.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.627
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.255
I'm right here!

17:32.551 --> 17:33.968
Earl?

17:35.846 --> 17:38.723
- I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

17:38.891 --> 17:41.309
The lady who sells toner?

17:41.477 --> 17:44.187
Um, look, you can't kill yourself.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.607
Look, um, I really appreciate
you coming down...

17:47.775 --> 17:49.484
No, no, I can't let you do it.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.818
Why?

17:50.986 --> 17:53.946
Because it was fate
that made me call you today.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.865
I thought it was toner.

17:56.575 --> 18:01.621
No. Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job, okay?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.540
And my first day on the job,
you're my first call.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.794
And somebody else might have hung up
on you, but I wouldn't do that...

18:07.961 --> 18:10.338
...because I know about this stuff.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.673
- My mom killed herself.
- Really?

18:12.841 --> 18:14.467
- Yes.
- How?

18:14.635 --> 18:16.260
I'm not gonna give you tips.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.181
Look, don't you see that this...?

18:20.349 --> 18:24.143
This all came together
so that I could stop you from doing this.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.523
- Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
- No, it's fate.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.693
It doesn't really seem like enough
to be fate.

18:32.861 --> 18:36.364
Oh, well. Um, okay, here's a weird thing.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.701
My mother was also a supply manager.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.871
I'm actually the office manager.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.249
Oh, my God. So was she!

18:46.416 --> 18:48.793
And get this, okay.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.755
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.882
Pearl.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.844
Was there anything else?

18:58.011 --> 18:59.428
Sure.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.890
Um, where are you from?

19:03.058 --> 19:05.726
- Philadelphia.
- Oh, my God, so was she!

19:07.521 --> 19:09.438
Oh, I've got goose bumps.

19:09.773 --> 19:10.857
Really?

19:11.024 --> 19:13.651
- Well, I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.
- Yeah.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.196
But... Look. Okay.
These jerks might not care about you...

19:17.364 --> 19:21.200
...but the universe does,
and that says a lot.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.996
Did you hear that?

19:25.414 --> 19:27.874
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

19:28.041 --> 19:30.334
...because the universe cares.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.712
The whole universe!

19:38.135 --> 19:40.553
I really wish they'd care just a little bit.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.974
Oh, this is terrible.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.727
Everything is destroyed.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.562
Look at this.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.649
It obviously meant enough for me
to save it, and now I can't tell what it is.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.153
It's still soft.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.949
What do you think this is?

20:03.410 --> 20:05.077
Mon, I think it was a mouse.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.297
- How are you, honey?
- How do you think I am?

20:16.465 --> 20:19.050
You've wrecked all
my childhood memories...

20:19.218 --> 20:21.052
...you love Ross more than me.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.472
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

20:26.183 --> 20:30.478
Sweetheart, we love you
just as much as Ross.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.647
Now, I'm sorry about everything
that happened...

20:32.814 --> 20:36.442
...and I'll probably never be able
to make it up to you...

20:36.610 --> 20:38.486
...but here's a start.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.450
- What's this?
- It's the key to my Porsche.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.786
Well, the key to your Porsche.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.915
- What?
- What?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.793
I've been thinking of getting rid of it...

20:53.961 --> 20:57.088
...and I was driving it the other day
and I saw my reflection in a window.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.424
Your mother's right,
I do look like an ass.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.220
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding me, right?

21:04.388 --> 21:07.431
Well, wait a minute.

21:07.599 --> 21:11.310
I mean, a couple of stupid boxes get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

21:13.397 --> 21:15.481
- Why don't we take it for a spin?
- All right.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.318
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!

21:27.619 --> 21:29.287
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.126
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.169
Know what happened
to Chandler's Barcalounger?

21:37.337 --> 21:39.380
Oh, yeah. Joey broke it.
Had to get rid of it.

21:39.548 --> 21:44.093
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
and the Barcalounger's gone?

21:44.261 --> 21:47.138
Heh. This is the best day ever!
