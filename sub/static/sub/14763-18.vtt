11:27.293 --> 11:29.012
It's over, Egghead.

11:29.137 --> 11:32.082
<i>It's been fun,
but I've had to go elsewhere</i>

11:32.137 --> 11:34.644
<i>to prepare the third act.</i>

11:36.613 --> 11:38.809
<i>You know, your big finish...</i>

11:38.910 --> 11:41.105
Get down!
<i>Finish... Finish...</i>

11:50.215 --> 11:53.934
Your directions have taken us
nowhere near our destination.

11:54.027 --> 11:55.777
We are lost.

11:55.873 --> 11:59.855
Zounds, odds bodkins,
and so on and so forth!

12:00.579 --> 12:01.819
You two lost?

12:01.934 --> 12:04.262
Perhaps one of you can direct me
back to the place

12:04.309 --> 12:07.441
mortals call,
"North Hollywood"?

12:07.707 --> 12:10.332
So be good commoners
and start talking,

12:10.394 --> 12:15.223
or else my buddy Thor here
will rip you guys to shreds.

12:15.488 --> 12:18.762
Hey, brother, you just
call us "commoners"?

12:20.973 --> 12:23.379
Yeah, we did...
Commoners!

12:23.582 --> 12:27.715
Wait. Do not listen to that man.
He is an actor.

12:27.957 --> 12:31.644
Actors. They've seen
too many movies.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.152
Come on, guys.
Let's get outta here.

12:42.235 --> 12:43.265
(GASPS)

12:43.289 --> 12:44.434
Oh! (STAMMERING)

12:44.519 --> 12:48.199
(GRUMBLING)  So, Thor, uh, when you're 
in your loneliest, darkest place,

12:48.245 --> 12:51.215
is your salad kale, romaine, or quinoa?
(GRUNTING)

12:51.332 --> 12:54.245
(CHUCKLES)  I will never
understand humans.

12:57.832 --> 13:00.566
You're not mad at me, right?
We're cool?

13:00.816 --> 13:02.160
You quit on us.

13:02.316 --> 13:03.809
I didn't quit, Natasha.

13:03.926 --> 13:06.769
I wanted to go home.
Tony understood.

13:06.815 --> 13:09.301
He helped set me up
with this great opportunity.

13:09.512 --> 13:12.285
So great you kept it quiet,
told us you had our back,

13:12.365 --> 13:14.910
then when the time was right,
you ditched us.

13:15.012 --> 13:17.082
Look, I loved
being an Avenger,

13:17.176 --> 13:19.887
but the Avengers are about
saving the entire world.

13:19.941 --> 13:21.583
I needed to carve out
my place in it

13:21.629 --> 13:23.605
before worrying about
the whole planet.

13:23.740 --> 13:25.559
I thought we were a team.

13:25.748 --> 13:27.848
Friday's got us a lead
on Egghead.

13:31.215 --> 13:32.934
(GRUNTING)

13:33.066 --> 13:35.918
Once again, my apologies
for the misunderstanding.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.582
Thank you for the directions,
but we must make haste.

13:39.762 --> 13:42.223
(IMITATING THOR)  My apologies 
for the misunderstanding.

13:42.316 --> 13:43.535
Make haste!

13:43.629 --> 13:46.293
Tad McDodd,
when we first met,

13:46.378 --> 13:49.863
I thought you might be a villain,
masquerading as an actor

13:50.004 --> 13:52.434
in order to get close
and catch me unaware.

13:52.590 --> 13:56.605
But now I see the truth.
You are a villain.

13:56.747 --> 13:58.223
An annoying one.

13:58.566 --> 14:00.871
(NORMAL VOICE) I'm trying
to understand you, man.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.238
To watch you move,
to hear you speak,

14:03.301 --> 14:06.715
see your home,
where you come from.

14:06.949 --> 14:10.980
Where I come from is Asgard,
but my home is Avengers...

14:11.026 --> 14:15.809
Yes, educate me.
Show me Asgard.

14:15.941 --> 14:19.355
You want an education?
You will get one.

14:19.473 --> 14:22.418
Heimdall, open the portal!

14:27.324 --> 14:30.075
Huh? Uh, uh,
maybe not so fast!

14:33.480 --> 14:35.730
HAWKEYE: Turns out Friday's
useful after all.

14:35.776 --> 14:37.644
Egghead has a bunch
of fake addresses,

14:37.723 --> 14:41.730
but this is where the studio
sends his checks.

14:41.879 --> 14:46.225
Hold on. Maybe we can do 
the entering without the breaking.

14:54.098 --> 14:56.035
I think we found Egghead.

14:56.176 --> 14:58.441
I think he found us.

14:58.527 --> 15:01.098
I worked so hard
on effects and props,

15:01.144 --> 15:03.207
but since getting fired,

15:03.371 --> 15:06.902
I've been thinking of getting
into costume design.

15:10.059 --> 15:12.676
What do you think of my suit?

15:12.816 --> 15:16.332
Uh, is it supposed
to look like a giant egg?

15:19.353 --> 15:20.353
(CROWING)

15:20.440 --> 15:22.240
(POWERING UP)

15:22.418 --> 15:27.295
EGGHEAD: <i>I've got a whole ne
line that's just to die for.</i>

15:31.218 --> 15:32.878
BLACK WIDOW: Scatter

15:35.723 --> 15:38.441
Scatter?
More like scramble!

15:50.402 --> 15:52.309
You can't hide from me.

15:55.964 --> 15:58.988
Ouch!
You've already failed.

15:59.145 --> 16:00.988
<i>I've activated
a launch sequence</i>

16:01.059 --> 16:04.160
<i>that will send my battle suits
all across Hollywood.</i>

16:04.441 --> 16:08.191
<i>And I assure you,
they're quite destructive.</i>

16:08.387 --> 16:11.098
Come on!
That looks like a giant...

16:12.887 --> 16:16.668
Is anyone else seeing this?
It's not just me, right?  (GRUNTS)

16:16.848 --> 16:18.152
(GRUNTS)

16:19.613 --> 16:22.735
Keep Egghead busy. 
I'm putting a stop to this launch.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.176
(WHIRRING)
Too late. It's launching.

16:25.316 --> 16:28.075
(MECHANICAL CLUCKING)

16:30.824 --> 16:32.863
I wasn't fast enough.

16:33.254 --> 16:34.449
(GRUNTS)

16:34.590 --> 16:36.685
Come on, Ant-Man.
This isn't over yet.

16:36.777 --> 16:38.051
(CROWING)

16:39.152 --> 16:41.754
No need to waste time
and energy on you.

16:41.879 --> 16:45.082
My automated robot suits
will flatten the city.

16:45.230 --> 16:48.160
But the movie studio
belongs to me!

16:51.137 --> 16:53.065
So, who's got an idea?

16:53.199 --> 16:55.168
Those other six suits
didn't have pilots.

16:55.262 --> 16:56.934
That's the weak point!

16:57.098 --> 17:00.340
<i>If we stop Egghead's suit,
we stop all the suits.</i>

17:00.574 --> 17:04.214
HAWKEYE: Friday, you got 
a track on the other half dozen?

17:04.371 --> 17:07.910
FRIDAY: <i>I estimate they will reach 
their destinations in four minutes.</i>

17:08.137 --> 17:10.082
Then we better make this fast.

17:12.473 --> 17:14.074
Barely slowing him down.

17:14.262 --> 17:16.699
Then my car will have
to speed him up.

17:16.855 --> 17:18.473
And I just had it washed.

17:18.659 --> 17:20.027

Natasha, remember that time the Avengers 
broke into that Chitauri warship?

19:21.497 --> 19:23.115
Yeah. And it didn't work.

19:23.325 --> 19:24.990
So it's bound
to work this time.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.091
