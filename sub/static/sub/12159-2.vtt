<i>"LAST MAN STANDING" IS RECORDED</i>

00:03.971 --> 00:05.170
<i>IN FRONT OF A LIVE</i>
<i>STUDIO AUDIENCE.</i>

00:05.172 --> 00:05.971
GOOD MORNING.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.006
OHH.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.007
MMM.
MMM.

00:08.009 --> 00:11.010
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.511
WAIT A MINUTE --
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

00:12.513 --> 00:14.046
THE "I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE A GREAT HUSBAND."

00:14.048 --> 00:16.181
IT SOUNDS LIKE, "I LOVE YOU.
I SCRATCHED YOUR TRUCK."

00:17.317 --> 00:19.118
IF I SCRATCHED
YOUR TRUCK,

00:19.120 --> 00:21.053
I WOULD KNOW ENOUGH
TO JUST KEEP DRIVING.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.488
SO, EVERYTHING'S GOOD?
YEAH.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.489
ALL RIGHT.

00:23.491 --> 00:24.656
IT'S JUST THAT --

00:24.658 --> 00:26.692
OHHHH, BOY.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.360
WELL, SUZY SHAW
AND BETSY WOLF

00:28.362 --> 00:30.129
ARE COMING TO TOWN
THIS WEEKEND.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.998
THOSE OLD BROADS
STILL TRAVEL?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.968
YES, MY COLLEGE ROOMMATES
CAN STILL TRAVEL.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.470
HONEY, YOU SHOULD SEE THEM
ON FACEBOOK.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.006
FOR "OLD BROADS,"
THEY LOOK AMAZING.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.042
I'VE SEEN SUZY
ON FACEBOOK.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.777
A LITTLE TOO MUCH BOTOX.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.180
SHE HAS THE SAME EXPRESSION
AT HER SURPRISE PARTY

00:48.182 --> 00:49.982
AS SHE DOES
AT HER DAD'S FUNERAL.

00:51.584 --> 00:53.085
I FEEL
A LITTLE INSECURE.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.587
I MEAN, THEY USED TO CALL US
"THE THREE HOT TODDIES,"

00:55.589 --> 00:59.558
AND NOW I'M AFRAID IT'LL BE
TWO TODDIES AND A MOSCOW MULE.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.994
TRUTH IS, I MARRIED
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

01:01.996 --> 01:05.030
FROM WHERE I STAND, SHE'S JUST
AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE EVER WAS.

01:05.032 --> 01:06.198
THANKS, HONEY.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.100
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF
THAT AGE IS JUST A NUMBER.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.402
AND NO MATTER
HOW CRAZY-BIG THAT NUMBER GETS,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.304
I'LL STILL LOVE YOU,
MOM.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.040
THANK YOU, MANDY.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.842
SO, HOW'S
THE FASHION BUSINESS, HUH?

01:16.844 --> 01:20.446
WELL, I.M.H.O.,
MY L.B.D.s COULD END UP
BEING A REALLY B.F.D.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.613
CUT THE HIPSTER TALK.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.449
SHE'S ALREADY FEELING
REALLY OLD TODAY.

01:24.884 --> 01:27.853
IN MY HUMBLE OPINION,
MY LITTLE BLACK DRESSES

01:27.855 --> 01:30.889
COULD END UP BEING
A REALLY BIG FRICKIN' DEAL.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.092
SOME GENERATIONS
WIN WORLD WARS.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.560
SOME WIN COLD WARS.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.362
SOME COME UP WITH
SNAZZY ABBREVIATIONS.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.530
BYE.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.266
HEY, UM...
I.L.Y.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.769
[ Chuckling ] OH. YEAH.
[ CHUCKLES ]

01:43.771 --> 01:46.271
I LOVE YAMS.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.208
BUT WHAT A WEIRD WAY
TO SAY "HAVE A NICE DAY."

01:49.210 --> 01:50.209
BYE, HONEY.
BYE, GUYS.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.477
BYE!
BYE!

01:51.479 --> 01:54.480
WOW. MANDY, HONEY,
THESE DRESSES LOOK AMAZING.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.814
I KNOW, RIGHT?
YEAH.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.484
BUT I NEED TO TAKE SOME
NEW PICTURES FOR THE WEBSITE,

01:58.486 --> 02:01.086
AND I'M HOPING TO FIND
A SLIGHTLY LEGGIER MODEL

02:01.088 --> 02:03.956
THAN, UH,
SERGEANT STUMPY OVER THERE.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.557
HEY.
I'M TALLER THAN YOU.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.658
HUH?

02:06.660 --> 02:09.228
NO WAY.
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

02:09.230 --> 02:10.762
UH, A WHILE AGO.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.198
BUT TO SPARE YOUR FEELINGS, I'VE
BEEN WALKING AROUND ON MY KNEES.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.169
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT --
I TOWER OVER BOTH OF YOU,

02:17.171 --> 02:20.005
SO, MANDY, MAYBE --
MAYBE<i> I</i> SHOULD BE YOUR MODEL.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.575
OKAY.

02:23.577 --> 02:27.813
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE JOKING,
BUT, LIKE...DON'T.

02:27.815 --> 02:31.016
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK I COULD
PULL OFF ONE OF YOUR L.B.D.s?

02:31.018 --> 02:31.850
AH.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.152
IT'S JUST THAT, UM...

02:33.154 --> 02:35.154
MODELING IS
A REALLY DANGEROUS BUSINESS.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.155
OKAY.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.857
AND I JUST --
I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO MUCH

02:38.859 --> 02:41.260
TO SEE YOU
GET ADDICTED TO HEROIN.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.195
SO...

02:43.197 --> 02:45.497
I'M GONNA STICK
WITH EVE.

02:47.634 --> 02:50.702
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:54.440 --> 02:56.308
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO
THE YOUNG ONE -- LIKE THAT.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.309
HEY.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.477
HI. HOW WERE DRILLS?

02:58.479 --> 02:59.645
TOUGH.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.380
IT'S JUST NICE KNOWING
WE'RE OUT THERE HITTING IT

03:01.382 --> 03:03.715
WHILE THE RUSKIES
ARE STILL IN BED.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.950
THE RUSKIES
AREN'T IN BED.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.752
THEY'RE DOING JELLO SHOTS
IN THE UKRAINE.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.388
AND YOU KNOW
WHO TO BLAME FOR THAT?

03:09.390 --> 03:12.224
OBAMA.
OBAMA.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.993
COUPLE YEARS, GUYS,
YOU'LL HAVE HILLARY TO BLAME

03:14.995 --> 03:17.162
FOR EVERYTHING
VLADIMIR PUTIN DOES.

03:17.164 --> 03:20.832
WOW. I LIKE BLAMING<i> HER</i>
FOR STUFF.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.235
BUT, THEN AGAIN, TO BLAME HER,
SHE'D HAVE TO BE PRESIDENT.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.270
THESE ARE THE TOUGH CHOICES
WE FACE AS AMERICANS.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.340
HEY.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.175
HOME SO SOON
FROM SPENCER'S PARTY?

03:30.177 --> 03:31.977
UH, BOYD
GOT THROWN OUT.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.545
WHAT?
FROM A BIRTHDAY PARTY?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.281
ONE TOO MANY JUICE BOXES.
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.151
HONEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

03:39.153 --> 03:41.920
SPENCER'S MOM SAID
I BROKE THE RULES.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.323
BOYD HAD THE OTHER
KIDS RUNNING AROUND
THE YARD PLAYING WAR.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.325
YOU KNOW, SHOOTING
FINGER PISTOLS AT EACH OTHER.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.126
STOP IT!

03:49.929 --> 03:52.231
A 7-YEAR-OLD
WITH A FINGER PISTOL?!

03:53.833 --> 03:56.335
DID YOU GET HIT
WITH ANY BOOGER BAZOOKAS?

03:57.770 --> 03:59.838
IF THEY COME
FOR<i> MY</i> FINGER,

03:59.840 --> 04:03.375
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PRY IT
FROM MY COLD, DEAD HAND.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.178
WE WERE JUST PLAYING
"DIRTY DOZEN."

04:06.180 --> 04:08.347
I WAS LEE MARVIN.

04:09.382 --> 04:10.682
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE A BORN LEADER.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.285
SERIOUSLY, MIKE? YOU SHOWED HIM
"THE DIRTY DOZEN"?

04:13.287 --> 04:15.621
HOW DO YOU THINK
HE LEARNED HOW TO COUNT TO 12?

04:15.623 --> 04:17.289
YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.791
SO, THIS WHOLE
UGLY INCIDENT OCCURRED

04:19.793 --> 04:23.295
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN INFLUENCES
THAT BOYD HAS IN HIS LIFE.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.631
TO BE CLEAR, WE ALL KNOW
I'M TALKING ABOUT MIKE, RIGHT?

04:25.633 --> 04:27.699
YEAH,<i> NOW</i> WHO'S
POINTING FINGERS?

04:27.701 --> 04:29.701
HONEY, COME ON. YOU WANT
TO COME HELP ME UPSTAIRS?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.403
OKAY.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.371
WE ARE PICKING OUT
AN OUTFIT.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.072
GRANDMA'S MEETING UP
WITH SOME OLD FRIENDS

04:34.074 --> 04:35.641
WHO SHE NEEDS
TO LOOK WAY BETTER THAN.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.376
CAN I CHANGE MY MIND?

04:37.378 --> 04:39.311
NO.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.214
I MEAN, COME ON, MIKE.
REALLY? YOU SHOWED
HIM "THE DIRTY DOZEN"?

04:42.216 --> 04:44.383
I DON'T WANT HIM
PRETENDING TO KILL GERMANS.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.386
SINCE WHEN DO YOU BECOME
SO PRO-NAZI?

04:47.388 --> 04:50.722
I AM NOT PRO-NAZI.
I'M JUST ANTI-VIOLENCE.

04:52.792 --> 04:56.595
ALTHOUGH I REALIZE I'M PREACHING
IN THE WRONG CHURCH HERE.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.996
CALM DOWN, BETTY.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.732
I'M JUST GOING OFF
TO PLAY PAINTBALL.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.267
THIS IS
WHERE IT STARTS.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.603
AS A CULTURE, WE TEACH
OUR CHILDREN TO BE VIOLENT.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.672
NO, NO, NO.
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE TAUGHT.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.341
YOU STUFF A PAPER DONKEY
FULL OF CANDY,

05:09.343 --> 05:13.011
GIVE KIDS STICKS, WATCH NATURE
JUST TAKE ITS COURSE.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.581
I STILL REMEMBER
<i>MY</i> FIRST PIÑATA.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.283
THE ONLY THING
DORA WAS EXPLORING

05:18.285 --> 05:20.352
WAS THE BUSINESS END
OF A BASEBALL BAT.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.424
WELL, I WOULD APPRECIATE
IF EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

05:25.426 --> 05:26.925
YOU COULD SHOW BOYD
A MOVIE

05:26.927 --> 05:29.027
WHERE CONFLICT IS SETTLED
THROUGH DIPLOMACY.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.262
SO TYPICAL, RYAN.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.297
YOU WANT ALL THE PROTECTION
THE MILITARY PROVIDES,

05:32.299 --> 05:34.833
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW
HOW THEY MAKE THE SAUSAGE.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.002
I<i> KNOW</i> HOW THEY MAKE
THE SAUSAGE.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.371
IT'S A BIG PART
OF WHY I'M A VEGETARIAN.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.406
ENJOY YOUR LENTIL CHOPS,
HIPPIE.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.042
I'M OFF TO SHOOT PEOPLE
WITH PAINT.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.310
BYE!
BYE!
BYE!

05:45.312 --> 05:46.878
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T SEE THE HARM

05:46.880 --> 05:49.281
STEERING BOYD
TOWARDS NONVIOLENT ACTIVITIES.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.683
HE JUST HELPED ME PICK OUT
THIS VERY PRETTY SCARF.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.487
I THINK
WE FOUND THE HARM.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.489
HEY.
HI.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.489
CAN YOU BELIEVE
OUR KID?

05:58.491 --> 06:01.026
THE ONE I DON'T BELIEVE
IS SPENCER'S MOM.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.395
THEY WERE PLAYING WAR
WITH THEIR FINGERS.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.497
WELL, I GOT A FINGER
FOR<i> HER.</i>

06:05.499 --> 06:07.332
WE HAVE A RULE
AMONG PARENTS --

06:07.334 --> 06:09.968
YOU INVITE MY KID TO A PARTY,
HE'S YOURS FOR FOUR HOURS.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.570
OH, THAT REMINDS ME --
I'VE GOT THAT HAIR APPOINTMENT,

06:11.572 --> 06:13.572
AND MARCI HAS A REALLY STRICT
CANCELATION POLICY.
OF COURSE. YES. GO.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.973
LET THE LADIES
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.141
YOU GO
GET YOUR HAIR DONE.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.678
SO, HOW'S, UH, BOYD DOING
WITH ALL THIS?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.713
YOU KNOW, HE ONLY HAS
A FEW FRIENDS,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.382
AND SPENCER
WAS HIS FAVORITE.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.417
I DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS
HAVING TROUBLE MAKING FRIENDS.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.719
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S LEE MARVIN,
THE LEADER.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.188
CAN NEVER GET CLOSE TO PEOPLE
'CAUSE...

06:30.190 --> 06:32.257
THEY ALWAYS COME AFTER
THE ONES YOU LOVE.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.228
MIKE, HONEY, THIS IS TROUBLING.
I MEAN<i> ALL</i> OF IT.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.398
BOYD'S STRUGGLE TO MAKE FRIENDS,
YOUR CRUSH ON LEE MARVIN.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.335
HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE FRIENDS
WITH THIS SPENCER WEENIE.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.404
I MEAN, 7-YEAR-OLDS MAKE FRIENDS
QUICKER THAN DRUNKS.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.038
THEY'RE FIGHTING ONE MINUTE,
AND THE NEXT,

06:47.040 --> 06:49.040
[ Slurring ]
"I LOVE YOU, MAN. I DO."

06:49.042 --> 06:52.511
HI, MOMMY. I GOT 86'ed
OUT OF THE PARTY.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.512
OH, I KNOW, SWEETIE,

06:53.514 --> 06:55.580
BUT DID YOU AT LEAST
GET TO EAT SOME CAKE?

06:55.582 --> 06:58.183
NO. AND IT WAS CARROT
WITH SOY ICE CREAM.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.251
OHHH.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.120
SPENCER'S MOM
DID YOU A FAVOR, PAL.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.456
CAN WE DO
SOMETHING FUN NOW?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.625
OH, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A PROBLEM.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.894
YOU SEE, MOMMY HAS TO
GET BACK TO WORK.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.961
WELL,
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.563
GRANDPA CAN TAKE YOU
TO OUTDOOR MAN,

07:11.565 --> 07:13.398
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT, 'CAUSE WE'RE
HAVING A WEEKEND PROMOTION,

07:13.400 --> 07:14.966
LOT OF KID STUFF TO DO.
OH, YEAH?

07:14.968 --> 07:17.469
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THERE'S A BOUNCY HOUSE,
ARCADE, FACE PAINTING.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.870
WE'LL MEET
SOME NEW FRIENDS.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.572
THERE'LL BE
MORE SPENCERS THERE

07:20.574 --> 07:22.441
THAN YOU CAN
SHAKE A STICK AT.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.408
AND DOWN AT OUTDOOR MAN,

07:23.410 --> 07:25.544
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
SHAKE STICKS AT PEOPLE.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.146
SOUNDS PERFECT, DAD.
THANK YOU.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.549
BUT BEFORE WE GO,
COME UP AND HELP GRANDPA
PICK OUT AN OUTFIT.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.550
COME ON!

07:38.925 --> 07:40.425
CAN I PLAY SHOOTING GALLERY,
GRANDPA?

07:40.427 --> 07:42.227
BOYD, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT
RIGHT NOW.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.663
WE'RE COMING HERE TO PLAY GAMES
AND -- AND MAKE FRIENDS HERE.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.332
LIKE...GO IN THE BOUNCY HOUSE.
A LOT OF NICE KIDS IN THERE.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.434
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE BOUNCY HOUSE.
YOU'RE GONNA GO --

07:49.436 --> 07:50.735
I WANT TO SHOOT
THE RIFLES.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.070
STOP, STOP, STOP.
CALM DOWN.
PLE-E-E-E-ASE?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.238
LET THE KID SHOOT!

07:53.240 --> 07:55.106
THERE'S A PITCH
TO THAT WHINE

07:55.108 --> 07:57.175
THAT CUTS
RIGHT THROUGH MY SKULL.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.478
LET'S DO A LITTLE SNACK.
HOW ABOUT A PRETZEL?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.780
TAKE HIM OVER THERE AND JUST
SPRAY MUSTARD ALL OVER HIS FACE.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.416
THAT'S WHERE IT'S GONNA END UP
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

08:04.418 --> 08:07.185
ALL RIGHT, THESE GLASSES
BELONG TO<i> THAT</i> GIRL,

08:07.187 --> 08:09.254
AND THIS INHALER
IS<i> HIS.</i>

08:09.256 --> 08:11.990
OR IS IT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.259
IT'S OKAY, KYLE. GIVE THAT
TO WHOEVER STARTS WHEEZING.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.528
GET THIS.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.929
HEH?

08:17.931 --> 08:20.165
BOYD GOES TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY
TODAY, AND THEY KICK HIM OUT

08:20.167 --> 08:22.367

17:35.188 --> 17:36.888
DON'T YOU WANT THEM
TO SEE THIS?

17:36.890 --> 17:39.257
BET YOU SUZY'S REACTION --
SURPRISE, EXCITEMENT, JEALOUSY.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.759
KIND OF HARD TO TELL WITH
THE BOTOX. IT'LL JUST BE...

17:43.529 --> 17:45.730
WELL...IT<i> IS</i> NICE

17:45.732 --> 17:48.199
TO LET THE GIRLS OUT
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.967
BELIEVE ME,
THE BOYS LIKE IT.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.938
OKAY.
WELL, THEN I'LL WEAR IT.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.106
GOOD. GOOD.
HAVE FUN.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.274
DON'T WAIT UP.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.408
OH, I'LL BE UP.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.846
[ Laughing ] WOW.
MOM, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.414
I KNOW.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.019
HEY, HEY, DAD, UH,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

18:08.021 --> 18:09.220
UH, SURE.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.056
YOU KNOW, THE BEST THING
ABOUT YOU MOVING OUT

18:12.058 --> 18:15.593
IS I GET TO SEE
SO MUCH OF YOU.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.630
UM, LOOK, I...
I NEED YOU...

18:19.632 --> 18:21.866
TO KEEP THIS HERE
FOR ME.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.135
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING TERRIBLE,
HAVEN'T YOU?

18:25.437 --> 18:28.039
WE GOT TO
GET OUR STORIES STRAIGHT.

18:28.041 --> 18:32.243
NO, UH, RYAN DOESN'T WANT IT
IN THE APARTMENT.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.645
TAKING ORDERS
FROM RYAN, HUH?

18:34.647 --> 18:36.481
IT WAS<i> MY</i> DECISION.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.649
IT'S YOUR RIGHT.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.285
IT'S ALSO MY RIGHT TO TELL YOU
IT'S A<i> STUPID</i> DECISION.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.455
IN THE CAR ON THE WAY OVER HERE,
I WAS, UH, THINKING

18:44.457 --> 18:46.891
ABOUT THAT SUMMER UP AT CAMP
WHEN YOU TAUGHT ME HOW TO SHOOT.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.059
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

18:48.061 --> 18:49.093
UH, TICK SUMMER.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.262
NO, THAT WAS
THE SUNBURN SUMMER.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.262
YEAH.

18:52.264 --> 18:53.831
YOU LINED UP THE CANS
ON THE FENCE,

18:53.833 --> 18:56.267
AND YOU TOLD ME TO PRETEND
THAT THEY WERE CRAIG GERARD

18:56.269 --> 18:58.736
BECAUSE HE KEPT CALLING ME
"SISSY KRISSY."

18:58.738 --> 19:00.738
HE ENDED UP MARRYING
A DUDE, DIDN'T HE?
MM-HMM.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.840
SO HE WAS PROBABLY
JUST PROJECTING BACK THEN.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.810
AND WHEN I WAS 16...

19:05.812 --> 19:08.079
YOU GAVE ME THIS GUN.

19:08.081 --> 19:09.780
I HAD A BIG FIGHT
WITH YOUR MOM ABOUT THAT.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.082
SHE SAID
WE SHOULD GET YOU A CAR.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.417
I SAID WITH A GUN, YOU CAN GET
WHATEVER CAR YOU WANT.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.287
WHEN I MOVED OUT,

19:16.289 --> 19:19.257
UH, I KNEW I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU
TO PROTECT ME ANYMORE,

19:19.259 --> 19:20.691
BUT I HAD<i> THIS.</i>

19:20.693 --> 19:23.327
YOU KNOW, IT WAS
A SORT OF PIECE OF YOU WITH ME,

19:23.329 --> 19:25.530
AND IT MADE IT
A LOT EASIER.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.765
BUT I'M
GETTING MARRIED NOW,

19:27.767 --> 19:31.169
AND I WANT RYAN TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE IN OUR HOME,

19:31.171 --> 19:33.437
SO I AM GETTING RID
OF THE COUCH

19:33.439 --> 19:35.840
AND ANYTHING
THAT KILLS PEOPLE.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.309
THANK GOD YOU GOT BOYD AROUND
TO PROTECT YOU.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.345
THAT AND WE DON'T OWN
ANYTHING WORTH STEALING, SO...

19:41.347 --> 19:44.282
WELL, CERTAINLY
NOT ANYMORE.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.349
DAD --

19:45.351 --> 19:47.185
I GET IT.
I GET IT, OKAY?

19:47.187 --> 19:48.786
ARE YOU MAD?
NO, I'M NOT MAD.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.288
I JUST WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER --

19:50.290 --> 19:51.889
WHEN HE'S OUT DELIVERING
FOR A WEEKEND

19:51.891 --> 19:54.225
AND YOU HEAR SOME NOISE
IN THE HOUSE THAT SCARES YOU --

19:54.227 --> 19:56.194
I KNOW, I KNOW --
DON'T COME CRYING TO YOU.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.828
NO. YOU CALL ME.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.331
I'LL BE THERE
BEFORE YOU HANG UP THE PHONE.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.142
THE BILL OF RIGHTS --
THE ACTUAL BILL OF RIGHTS.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.844
I GOT TO GET THIS BACK.
THEY'RE GONNA BE PRETTY UPSET.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.214
THIS SACRED DOCUMENT
MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS

20:16.216 --> 20:17.748
TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.251
TO A PATRIOT, IT'S A SAFEGUARD
FOR THOSE PERSONAL FREEDOMS

20:20.253 --> 20:22.520
WE HOLD BACK
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.989
FOR NIC CAGE,
IT'S A CODED TREASURE MAP

20:24.991 --> 20:28.559
LEADING HIM
TO BEN FRANKLIN'S GOLD.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.695
THE FIRST AMENDMENT --
BOY, THAT'S A BIG ONE.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.830
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RELIGION,
ALSO KNOWN AS

20:32.832 --> 20:36.267
"WHY YOU CAN'T SHOVE
A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS
OFF YOUR PORCH."

20:36.269 --> 20:38.603
SECOND AMENDMENT --
OH, BOY, HERE WE GO --

20:38.605 --> 20:39.704
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.607
AND BY "ARMS," I THINK
THE FOUNDERS ALSO MEANT...

20:42.609 --> 20:44.008
FINGER GUNS.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.777
OUTDOOR MAN ENCOURAGES
GUN RIGHTS, SAFETY,

20:46.779 --> 20:47.912
AND RESPECT FOR OTHERS.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.681
OUR FOCUS MUST BE ON
KEEPING GUNS IN PROPER HANDS.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.751
NOW, 99% OF YOU GUN OWNERS
ARE SMART, SANE PEOPLE.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.021
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU,
SO GO ON ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.423
THIS MESSAGE IS
FOR THE CRAZY PEOPLE.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.058
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.860
YOU WEAR FULL-BODY ARMOR

21:02.862 --> 21:06.063
AND CARRY AN AK-47
TO ORDER A BURRITO AT CHIPOTLE.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.598
NOT NECESSARY.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.868
IF YOU ASK POLITELY,
THEY'LL GIVE THE EXTRA SALSA.

21:10.870 --> 21:14.071
BESIDES, THE LAST THING
YOU FOLKS NEED IS "SPICY FOOD."

21:14.073 --> 21:17.375
YOU NEED HELP.
TALK TO SOMEBODY.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.377
AND THE VOICES IN YOUR HEAD
DON'T COUNT.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.811
FOR THE REST OF US,

21:20.813 --> 21:23.614
LET'S CONTINUE TO EXERCISE
OUR GUN RIGHTS RESPONSIBLY.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.216
THAT WAY,
WE CAN KEEP BIG GOVERNMENT

21:25.218 --> 21:26.884
FROM CLIMBING INTO BED
WITH US --

21:26.886 --> 21:29.453
UNLESS YOUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
IS BEING SPOONED BY...

21:29.455 --> 21:31.522
NANCY PELOSI.
