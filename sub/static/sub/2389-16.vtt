KELLY: Orchestra camp.

It's not as lame
as it sounds.

03:57.790 --> 03:59.589

04:02.211 --> 04:03.343

04:03.345 --> 04:05.212
I'm at this public school

04:05.214 --> 04:06.430
It's totally underfunded,

04:06.432 --> 04:07.831

can't afford instruments,

Take my cello.

04:09.601 --> 04:10.767
What?
Yeah.

Oh, yeah, you
gotta take it.

it in years.

05:20.956 --> 05:22.873
I was on a date,
and it worked.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.958
And then I was on another date
and it worked again,

05:24.960 --> 05:26.593
so I figured it would work
all the time.

05:26.595 --> 05:28.128
Well, now you know
it doesn't work all the time.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.913
Yeah.

05:29.915 --> 05:31.998
Although two out of three...

05:32.000 --> 05:34.101

05:36.755 --> 05:39.389

05:39.391 --> 05:43.193

05:53.822 --> 05:55.739
I felt lost

05:55.741 --> 05:57.741
for a long time, too.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.394
I was living in
my parents' basement.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.964
Playing video games, mastur...

06:03.966 --> 06:05.715
ing those games,

06:05.717 --> 06:06.850
until

06:06.852 --> 06:08.218
I finally woke up

06:08.220 --> 06:11.138
and realized I wanted
to follow my dream

06:11.140 --> 06:12.672
of teaching music.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.476
Let me save you a few years.

06:16.478 --> 06:19.229
Even if it sound
completely crazy...

06:19.231 --> 06:21.431
what is it you want
to do with your life?

06:21.433 --> 06:24.968
I want to end poverty.

06:24.970 --> 06:26.403
Great.

06:26.405 --> 06:28.972

from here on out

06:28.974 --> 06:31.291
should be in service of that.

06:32.410 --> 06:33.410

07:02.172 --> 07:04.357
Oh, what the hell?

07:05.643 --> 07:08.061
THE MOTHER: <i>When I got to the club,</i>

<i>I knew that if I really wanted</i>

07:16.371 --> 07:19.489
I had to get a degree

07:19.491 --> 07:21.241
So...

07:21.243 --> 07:22.542
to answer your question,

07:22.544 --> 07:24.077
that's how I got here.

07:24.079 --> 07:27.030
I meant, how did you get here
from the subway station?

07:27.032 --> 07:27.600
Oh.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.663
But I'm only asking
'cause I just moved to town.

07:37.509 --> 07:38.475

07:38.477 --> 07:39.976

07:39.978 --> 07:41.978
I like to believe in people.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.632

Just promise me there won't be

07:48.020 --> 07:49.402
any naked men
in the living room.

07:49.404 --> 07:50.687
Not a problem.

07:50.689 --> 07:54.024
I'm on permanent hiatus
in the love department.

07:54.026 --> 07:55.025
Really?

07:55.027 --> 07:56.326
I find that hard to believe.

07:56.328 --> 07:57.727
I guess I'm
old-fashioned.

07:57.729 --> 08:00.864
I believe that each of us
only gets one.

08:00.866 --> 08:03.617
And I got mine already.

08:03.619 --> 08:04.918
Well, if you ask me,

08:04.920 --> 08:07.037
you know what comes
after the one?

08:07.039 --> 08:08.071
The next one.

08:08.073 --> 08:09.422

Oh, yeah.

08:13.879 --> 08:15.178
Hi.

08:15.180 --> 08:16.513
Is this room seven?

08:20.941 --> 08:23.919
And so, if you must bring food
to this class,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.971
please bring enough
for everyone.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.906
I don't want to see someone

08:27.908 --> 08:30.142
eating, say, lobster,
in the front row

08:30.144 --> 08:32.461
without sharing
with the rest of of us.

08:32.462 --> 08:33.928
Because that...

08:33.929 --> 08:37.032
would be shellfish.

08:37.034 --> 08:39.234
(laughs)

08:41.287 --> 08:43.371
Come on,
that was funny.

08:43.373 --> 08:45.323
Anyway... (clears throat)
...this is Architecture 101.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.658
Architecture 101?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.727
Oh, no, I'm in the wrong class!
I have to go!

08:50.563 --> 08:52.330
Oh, sorry.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.381
Um...

08:53.383 --> 08:54.783
Oh, God.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.151
Wait, I was in the right class.

08:56.153 --> 08:58.753
First day as a professor,
wrong classroom, coming through!

09:02.225 --> 09:04.176
TED:
<i>You play bass?</i>

09:04.178 --> 09:05.894
Seriously,
ask my friends.

09:05.896 --> 09:06.895
I always say

09:06.897 --> 09:08.180
my ideal woman...

09:08.881 --> 09:10.131
...does not play bass,

09:10.133 --> 09:12.350
because this is clearly
your roommate's.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.518
She's in a band.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.969
Damn, that's cool.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.238
This is unbelievable.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.240
You just picked out
the only three things in here

09:18.242 --> 09:19.491
that are my roommate's.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.526
So does your roommate's band
ever play shows or...

09:21.528 --> 09:24.412
Get out.
All right.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.002
Okay, this is crazy.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.588
Do you know where this
umbrella came from?

09:49.590 --> 09:50.972
Because I could've
sworn that I...

09:51.941 --> 09:53.325
What's wrong?

09:53.327 --> 09:54.476
Are you okay?

09:54.478 --> 09:55.861
We broke up.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.480
Oh... well,
I never liked him,

09:58.482 --> 10:01.116
and I never thought
he deserved you, and...

10:01.118 --> 10:03.184
I am sorry, I didn't know
you were dating someone.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.119
Who was this?

10:04.121 --> 10:06.655
He was the architecture
professor.

10:06.657 --> 10:09.357
The one who taught
Econ 305 by accident.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.858
Oh.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.160
That guy?

10:12.162 --> 10:13.712
Why did you break up?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.247
He's got a thing for you.

10:15.249 --> 10:16.531
What?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.699
Yeah, what?

10:17.701 --> 10:19.033
He's... what?

10:19.035 --> 10:21.419
How... um, how could
he have a thing for me?

10:21.421 --> 10:22.721
He's never even met me.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.038
He didn't have to.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.341
Everything he saw of yours,
he went crazy for.

10:26.343 --> 10:28.510
You should've brought
him to my room.

10:28.512 --> 10:30.312
Okay? He would've
run screaming

10:30.314 --> 10:31.930
once he saw my
calligraphy set,

10:31.932 --> 10:33.098
my coin collection,

10:33.100 --> 10:36.067
my chain-mail corset
from the Renaissance Faire.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.019
Well, that's pretty cool.

10:38.021 --> 10:39.104
Come on.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.822
How could he not
be in love with you?

10:40.824 --> 10:42.890
The way you
fall asleep on the couch

10:42.892 --> 10:44.025
when you're doing the crossword.

10:44.027 --> 10:45.660
When did he see me
fall asleep on...

10:45.662 --> 10:47.061
The way your hair smells.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.798
The way your eyes sparkle.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.739
I might have some stuff
to figure out.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.375
You might.
I'm so sorry!

11:00.377 --> 11:02.294
No, uh, it's okay.

11:02.296 --> 11:03.745
It was nice.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.048
I haven't been kissed
in a really long time.

11:07.050 --> 11:09.968
<i>Not long after that,</i>
<i>she met a nice girl</i>

11:09.970 --> 11:11.853
<i>and they fell in love,</i>

11:11.855 --> 11:14.856
so it's a happy ending--
for Cindy anyway.

11:14.858 --> 11:17.359
I, however, am left
without a roommate,

11:17.361 --> 11:19.561
so here we are.

11:19.563 --> 11:20.928
(chuckles)

11:20.930 --> 11:22.230
I have a confession.

11:22.232 --> 11:24.532
Uh, I don't need
a place to live.

11:24.534 --> 11:26.818
I saw your ad for the
roommate, and I just...

11:26.820 --> 11:28.620
I-I really wanted to meet you.

11:28.622 --> 11:32.707
I-I'm a huge fan of your
band SuperFreakonomics.

11:32.709 --> 11:34.292
Oh, my gosh, really?

11:34.294 --> 11:36.127
Really, come
I to all your shows,

11:36.129 --> 11:38.463
and I'm not just saying this--
I think you guys are

11:38.465 --> 11:41.949
the best economic-themed band
in the entire city.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.085
Even better
than Radiohedge Fund?

11:44.087 --> 11:45.337
Oh, absolutely.

11:45.339 --> 11:48.773
I wish I had the guts
to do what you do.

11:49.425 --> 11:53.478
I love to sing, but...

11:53.480 --> 11:55.263
You know what?

11:55.265 --> 11:58.966
Next time we do a show, you have
got to come up onstage with us

11:58.968 --> 11:59.934
and sing a song.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.853
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Mm-hmm.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.639
No, I'm, I'm, I'm too shy.

12:05.775 --> 12:08.643
♪ But maybe just one song!

12:08.645 --> 12:10.478
♪ Yeah!

12:10.480 --> 12:14.616
I mean, I don't like to think
of SuperFreakonomics as my band.

12:14.618 --> 12:16.584
I think of it as my canvas

12:16.586 --> 12:19.487
upon which I paint
my masterpieces.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.822
(laughs)

12:20.824 --> 12:23.375
And that right there is
why I don't play bass.

12:23.377 --> 12:26.327
(laughter)

12:27.162 --> 12:28.930
Can I help you
with that?

12:28.932 --> 12:32.801
Uh, wow, thanks, Superman.

12:32.803 --> 12:34.769
No problem.

12:34.771 --> 12:35.670
It's either help you

12:35.672 --> 12:37.389
or stop a train
from going off a cliff,

12:37.391 --> 12:38.773
and you're much cuter.

12:38.775 --> 12:39.974
(chuckles)

12:39.976 --> 12:41.008
Can I buy you a drink?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.495
Oh, no, sorry, I'm 16.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.315
Oh, wow, sorry.

12:47.317 --> 12:48.516
Have a good night.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.951
Wait, you believe that?

12:50.619 --> 12:51.820
I like you.

12:51.822 --> 12:54.322
Uh, sure,
you can buy me a drink.

12:54.324 --> 12:55.890
MacLaren's.

12:55.892 --> 12:56.841
The last time I was here,

12:56.843 --> 12:58.676
I thought this place
was called Puzzles.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.078
That's an odd name.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.963
Why would you call a bar
Puzzles?

13:01.965 --> 13:04.716
Unless that's the puzzle.

13:04.718 --> 13:05.917
Well, um,

13:05.919 --> 13:08.470
thank you for the drink.

13:08.472 --> 13:11.222
Uh, so, do you want
to get dinner sometime?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.425
Um...

13:14.710 --> 13:17.729
Louis, you're really nice,
but...

13:17.731 --> 13:20.899
I was in love with somebody
a long time ago,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.817
and he died.

13:22.819 --> 13:24.269
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.739
Uh, it's silly, but...

13:27.741 --> 13:31.893
it's like the first lottery
ticket I ever bought was...

13:31.895 --> 13:36.114
kaboom, jackpot, and I'm pretty
sure I'm not going to win again,

13:36.116 --> 13:37.449
not like that anyway,

13:37.451 --> 13:41.453
so I don't generally buy
lottery tickets anymore.

13:41.455 --> 13:42.620
I understand.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.739
So I should... go.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.009
Well, if you
change your mind...

13:48.928 --> 13:50.745
...give me a call.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.180
Okay.

14:00.022 --> 14:02.440
Okay, <i>now</i> we're even!

14:02.442 --> 14:04.225
What?!
What?!

14:04.227 --> 14:06.694
So we got dinner.
And?

14:08.096 --> 14:10.031
He's... nice.

14:10.033 --> 14:12.867
Nice? He sounds amazing!

14:12.869 --> 14:14.769
Handsome, good dresser,
paid for dinner.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.103
What more do you want?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.105
Do you know how rough
it is out there?

14:18.107 --> 14:20.441
I once met a guy claiming
to be a genie

14:20.443 --> 14:22.076
whose penis grants wishes.

14:22.078 --> 14:25.163
Oh, my God,
who would even fall for that?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.582
The point is,
Louis sounds great.

14:27.584 --> 14:30.451
NARRATOR: <i>And that's how your mom</i>
<i>started dating Louis.</i>

14:30.453 --> 14:33.120
<i>And for a couple years,</i>
<i>it was fun.</i>

14:33.122 --> 14:35.974
THE MOTHER:
♪ One tasty English muffin

14:35.976 --> 14:38.593
♪ Baby, that is what I am

14:38.595 --> 14:39.644
♪ Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da

14:39.646 --> 14:42.514
♪ One tasty English muffin

14:42.516 --> 14:47.268
♪ With some raspberry jam.

14:47.270 --> 14:49.103
That's funny.
(chuckles)

14:50.022 --> 14:52.357
NARRATOR:
<i>It just wasn't love.</i>

14:52.359 --> 14:54.809
<i>But then fate intervened.</i>

14:54.811 --> 14:57.028
Anyway, you guys wouldn't, uh,
happen to know of any

14:57.030 --> 14:59.581
good wedding bands available
at the last minute, would you?

15:00.833 --> 15:04.619
Hi. One ticket
to Farhampton, please.

15:04.621 --> 15:07.172
NARRATOR: <i>Now, Louis had a beach house</i>
<i>out in Farhampton,</i>

15:07.174 --> 15:08.706
<i>so he let your mother</i>
<i>stay there.</i>

15:08.708 --> 15:10.758
<i>The day before the wedding,</i>
<i>as she was taking</i>

15:10.760 --> 15:12.927
<i>some cookies out of the oven,</i>
<i>she got an e-mail.</i>

15:12.929 --> 15:15.880
(gasps)
What the damn hell?!

15:15.882 --> 15:18.666
"Bass player wanted,"
that is what the ad said.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.518
Can you believe that?

15:20.520 --> 15:24.822
After I'm the one who invited
Darren into the band.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.107
What am I gonna do?

15:26.109 --> 15:29.477
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.981
Then run my husband over
with it.

15:32.983 --> 15:34.983
Well, that's very tempting.

15:34.985 --> 15:37.318
I've never really been
the type of person to...

15:37.320 --> 15:39.671
"Must be hotter
than the girl we have now,

15:39.673 --> 15:42.407
who, in my opinion,
is a six at best"?

15:46.128 --> 15:49.747
Aw, geez, what is this
knucklehead doing?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.587
Excuse me! Hey!

15:55.589 --> 15:57.255
You guys need a lift?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.890
DARREN:
<i>The best man just punched me</i>

15:58.892 --> 16:00.475
<i>in the face for no reason.</i>

16:00.477 --> 16:01.476
You know what? I quit.

16:01.478 --> 16:03.094
You can have
your stupid band back.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.982
Linus, whoever that best man is,

16:07.984 --> 16:11.736
I would like to buy him
a double of your finest scotch.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.364
Louis!

16:28.737 --> 16:30.555
Will you marry me?

16:34.993 --> 16:39.939
Can you give me a minute?
Um... okay.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.724
There's someone
that I need to talk to.

16:44.010 --> 16:46.061
I'll-I'll be right back.

16:47.764 --> 16:49.481
(breathes heavily)

16:56.639 --> 17:00.692
Hi, Max. It's me.

17:00.694 --> 17:02.294
Sorry to interrupt.

17:02.296 --> 17:05.480
I know you're probably up there
playing baseball with your dad.

17:05.482 --> 17:10.618
Um, look, I-I've got
a situation here.

17:10.621 --> 17:15.207
I think that I have been
holding myself back

17:15.209 --> 17:18.510
from falling in love again.

17:18.512 --> 17:23.298
(voice breaks): And I think it's because
I can't let you go.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.251
But you're not here anymore...

17:26.252 --> 17:31.056
so I have to ask this:

17:31.058 --> 17:35.727
Would it be okay
if I moved on?

17:37.313 --> 17:40.949
I realize that you have no way
of answering that,

17:40.951 --> 17:42.284
but, um...

17:42.286 --> 17:44.152
Oh, okay... (laughs)

17:44.154 --> 17:47.772
I will take that as yes.

17:47.774 --> 17:51.910
Um, in that case,
I should get back in there.

17:58.501 --> 18:02.620
(voice breaks):
I guess this is it.

18:02.622 --> 18:04.506
For real this time.

18:06.976 --> 18:09.177
Bye, Max. (sniffles)

18:14.067 --> 18:16.852
(sighs, sniffles)

18:24.444 --> 18:26.862
So?

18:34.921 --> 18:37.372
My answer is...

18:37.374 --> 18:39.074
no.

18:46.265 --> 18:47.933
(sighs)

18:50.336 --> 18:51.686
(sobs)

18:53.672 --> 18:55.223
DESK CLERK:
<i>You're in luck.</i>

18:55.225 --> 18:57.059
Mother of the bride
never checked in.

18:57.860 --> 18:58.977
How many keys
will you be needing?

18:58.979 --> 18:59.945
Just one.

18:59.947 --> 19:01.346
Yeah.
I just...

19:01.348 --> 19:04.032
I broke up with someone.

19:07.870 --> 19:11.773
I think room number six
is the room for you.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.191
Thank you.

19:32.711 --> 19:34.262
