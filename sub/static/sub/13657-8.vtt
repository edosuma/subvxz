08:41.522 --> 08:44.656
Oh, that's not true. He's been
meeting lots of new people.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.459
He's going to a.A.
And pulling his life together.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.227
Mary, if he was really
pulling his life together,

08:49.229 --> 08:51.763
We wouldn't be standing
in a police station <i>again.</i>

08:53.199 --> 08:55.400
So, please, can we just get
the bad news over with?

08:55.402 --> 08:58.003
Is it another d.U.I.?
Did he have pot on him?

08:58.005 --> 09:01.406
Albert! He's been sober
for almost three weeks.

09:01.408 --> 09:05.043
What has mateo told you
about these new friends?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.811
Has he mentioned names
or anything?

09:06.813 --> 09:09.548
No, just that he's meeting
some good people.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.082
Flynn: How about the kids
he grew up with,

09:11.084 --> 09:13.385
People he hung around with
before a.A.?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.720
Except for raymond,
everyone he knew gave up on him.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.556
That's why he went
to a.A. To begin with.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.324
Raymond --
who is raymond?

09:19.326 --> 09:21.560
His cousin, but they hardly
talk to each other anymore.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.595
Look, keep raymond
out of this.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.931
What are we doing here?

09:29.502 --> 09:33.305
Mr. And mrs. Torres, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.709
What kind of bad news?

09:37.711 --> 09:40.111
Your son was killed
early this morning...

09:40.113 --> 09:41.346
[ voice breaking ]
oh, my god.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.781
...During the commission
of a robbery.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.115
He and a friend
broke into someone's --

09:44.117 --> 09:46.851
That -- no, that can't be.
Are you sure?

09:46.853 --> 09:48.119
Yes, we are.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.191
I'm so sorry.
[ sobs ]

09:53.193 --> 09:54.359
I'm so sorry.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.627
I don't understand.
What friend?

09:55.629 --> 09:56.628
No!

09:56.630 --> 09:57.929
Who would he --

09:57.931 --> 09:59.364
That's what we're
trying to find out.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.966
But matty's never done
anything like that before.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.034
We should tell you that
you're probably gonna see

10:03.036 --> 10:04.869
Stuff about this
on the news.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.305
The owner of the house is
some famous swimming coach,

10:07.307 --> 10:08.873
And the kids
he trained --
wait --

10:08.875 --> 10:10.041
What's his name,
this coach?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.376
Charles frey. Why?

10:11.378 --> 10:12.978
Oh, no. Oh, god.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.245
Sir...

10:14.247 --> 10:15.747
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
[ sobs ]

10:15.749 --> 10:17.549
What did you do?!

10:17.551 --> 10:19.317
What did you do?

10:19.319 --> 10:22.220
Tell me, albert,
what did you do?!

10:22.222 --> 10:23.588
I'm so sorry.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.557
I'm so sorry.

10:25.559 --> 10:29.394
Albert: God, it's my fault.
It's my fault!
No!

the victim's cousin,

He's an r.N.
At midway hospital.

10:39.573 --> 10:42.007
He's not at work today,
and he's not at home.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.843
You know, buzz, it sure would
be nice if we could hear

10:44.845 --> 10:46.911
What the victim's parents
are saying right now.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.680
And if I didn't have to
set the cameras up

10:48.682 --> 10:50.682
Every single time
we needed them, you could.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.485
The conference room is used
for administrative purposes,

10:53.487 --> 10:55.787
But I will ask
for another waiver.

Off to get
the warrant signed.

pay for that.

We should be searching
the victim's house

Hey, rusty.
How's school?

11:16.943 --> 11:18.309
It's okay.
Buzz: Where's kris?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.611
I thought she was
studying with you today.

11:19.613 --> 11:22.013
Uh, she's not coming.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.181
Everything okay?

11:23.183 --> 11:24.983
What happened?

11:24.985 --> 11:26.451
It's her parents.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.621
I guess she didn't
tell them much about me

11:29.623 --> 11:31.189
Before I went over
to their house before dinner.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.692
Um, then they started in
with the questions,

11:33.694 --> 11:37.195
And I answered them, you know,
just trying to be honest.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.997
Uh, a-and then,
this morning,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.699
They decided that kris
can no longer

11:40.701 --> 11:42.867
Spend time with me
outside of school.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.669
Well, that's not
very nice.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.706
It's really not that big
of a deal, uh, so...

R-right down
the hallway here,

12:04.691 --> 12:07.792
Uh, out past the elevators
you came up on.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.005
Albert: Matty was good
at everything,

12:21.007 --> 12:23.408
But he loved the water.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.744
He learned to swim
before he could walk.

12:25.746 --> 12:29.047
He just got
faster and faster.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.749
Matty was a swimmer.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.283
I was proud of him.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.854
When he was 13, I signed him up
on a local club team,

12:35.856 --> 12:38.056
And this guy frey --
he was famous even then.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.358
He spotted matty
at a competition.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.862
Charles frey
was your son's swim coach.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.431
H-he was.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.667
And now our lives
are broken in two.

12:51.904 --> 12:54.539
The part before albert

12:54.541 --> 12:57.909
Forced our son
to be a swimmer,

12:57.911 --> 12:59.477
And the part after,

12:59.479 --> 13:02.781
When matty didn't live up
to my husband's expectations.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.250
My wife and I
are both teachers.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.818
We evaluate kids
all the time,

13:06.820 --> 13:10.221
And my son...

13:10.223 --> 13:11.956
My son was a prodigy.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.092
Only been with coach frey
three months

13:14.094 --> 13:16.761
Before he started breaking
records at invitationals.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.963
Then he went
to junior nationals.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.332
They were even talking about
the olympics.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.334
Maybe it was
too much pressure.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.837
Mary: We should have never
pushed him like that,

13:25.839 --> 13:29.641
Competing
almost every weekend...

13:29.643 --> 13:33.912
All that talk about
winning, winning, winning.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.413
Sounds intense.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.915
I should have stopped it.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.083
Matty was too sensitive.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.852
He wasn't ready for that.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.988
It was about a year in when
things started to fall apart.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.758
Matty's times weren't
what they needed to be,

13:46.760 --> 13:48.259
And over the following
six months,

13:48.261 --> 13:50.361
They just kept
getting worse.

13:50.363 --> 13:54.599
That was when albert and I
sat down with coach frey,

13:54.601 --> 13:57.268
And he said matty
didn't have it,

13:57.270 --> 14:00.271
Said we should save our money
and take him off the team.

14:00.273 --> 14:04.509
Save our money --
that's what he said.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.212
And frey also told us
that we should tell matty

14:07.214 --> 14:08.847
That it was our choice,

14:08.849 --> 14:12.217
So that matty didn't think
that he had failed.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.652
And that's what you did?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.321
Maybe it was
the right thing.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.857
I don't know, but matty...

14:18.859 --> 14:20.525
He just closed up.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.160
He lost his drive.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.395
He started doing badly
at school --

14:24.397 --> 14:26.798
Drinking, drugs.

14:26.800 --> 14:31.135
After that, I-I couldn't
reach him anymore.

what did you mean earlier

14:41.181 --> 14:43.281
When you said
it was all your fault?

14:45.017 --> 14:48.419
Matty turned 23
a couple of days ago.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.724
H-he was broke,
unemployed, living at home.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.926
Last night, my wife went out,
and I sat him down,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.995
And I told him
it's time to grow up,

14:56.997 --> 14:59.430
And he just started in
about the swimming

14:59.432 --> 15:01.499
And how he blamed me
for taking him out,

15:01.501 --> 15:03.268
And I just had it,

15:03.270 --> 15:06.104
And I said it was
his coach's decision all along,

15:06.106 --> 15:07.872
Not ours.

15:07.874 --> 15:11.109
Coach frey cut him from the team
because he couldn't keep up.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.079
What did your son do?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.347
He just stared at me.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.617
The expression
on his face was...

15:21.253 --> 15:24.022
And then he turned,
and he walked away

15:24.024 --> 15:25.456
And slammed the door
to his room.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.160
And that was
the last time I saw him.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.998
Why did you tell us
you never heard of the kid?!

15:36.068 --> 15:39.304
You called him mateo.
We all called him matty.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.806
I certainly wouldn't
recognize him from this photo.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.341
God, what happened
to the kid?

15:44.376 --> 15:47.078
Any idea why he'd
break into your home?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.479
None, okay?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.448
Why don't you ask
the guy he was with?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.483
Look, I'm sorry.
I barely remember him.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.452
I have 50, 60 kids
every season.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.088
If somebody doesn't measure up,
I have to let them go.

15:57.090 --> 16:01.893
And with matty,
if this is even the same boy,

16:01.895 --> 16:04.495
I worked with him
maybe...

16:04.497 --> 16:07.598
18 months...
10 years ago.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.933
Sykes: You wouldn't
recognize me either.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.902
I look totally different
from when I was 13.

16:10.904 --> 16:12.904
Plus, there was
a guy with a gun there --

16:12.906 --> 16:16.274
Our robber/suspect
in a hoodie.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.775
Maybe it was
the cousin, raymond.

16:17.777 --> 16:21.045
Here's what the sketch artist
came up with.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.581
Kind of looks like raymond

16:23.583 --> 16:26.117
Only this dmv photo of him
is two years old.

16:26.119 --> 16:30.455
Turns out matty torres had
a blood alcohol content of .18,

16:30.457 --> 16:32.490
So maybe he and raymond
hit a few bars

16:32.492 --> 16:33.992
On their way
to jump the coach.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.360
Brought back some goodies
from the torres house.

We got the kid's computer

16:37.030 --> 16:38.763
And a bunch of videos
of his old swim meets, ma'am.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.598
And a box
of broken trophies.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.166
He went after them
with a bat.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.435
Bat?
That's a lot of anger.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.970
Look at this.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.505
We found it in the mess
at the coach's house.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.941
Looks like it goes with
one of these trophies.

16:49.943 --> 16:51.109
Well, that's probably
what he threw

16:51.111 --> 16:52.944
Through the coach's window.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.881
Andy, look at
this inscription.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.323
They all say
"mateo torres."

17:05.325 --> 17:06.858
Frey said he only knew
the name matty.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.493
This kid was a winner.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.028
You don't forget
someone like that.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.729
Frey is lying.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.231
But why?

17:24.410 --> 17:27.745
Captain, where are we
on this coach frey robbery?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.248
It's not looking like
a robbery anymore.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.517
Looking more like an attack
on the coach.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.185
As far as the local news
is concerned,

17:34.187 --> 17:37.221
We have a rich white guy
shooting an unarmed latino kid.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.323
It's very clear
that matty torres

17:39.325 --> 17:40.725
Broke into that house.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.161
Regardless, the press
is pushing the race angle.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.529
Get ahead of it fast,

a better story,

Are we at least close to finding
this raymond kid?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.944
We are passing out the rendering
from the sketch artist,

17:59.946 --> 18:01.546
And lieutenant tao and buzz

18:01.548 --> 18:03.881
Are going through
matty torres' computer.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.616
What about showing frey
a six-pack

18:05.618 --> 18:06.951
With raymond's picture
in it,

18:06.953 --> 18:08.386
See if he picks
the kid out?

18:08.388 --> 18:10.988

as a background check.

It doesn't matter --
if mateo broke into frey's home,

That's enough to make this
a justifiable homicide.

for murder?

26:47.306 --> 26:48.606

either.
