(gasps)

00:28.208 --> 00:29.834
All I'm saying is

00:29.917 --> 00:33.417
a ninja sword cannot
cut through a bulldozer.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.291
Come on! It slices through
Robo-Apes, Robo-Lizards,

00:37.375 --> 00:39.959
-Robo-Donkeys Robo-Birds...
-That's great!

00:40.041 --> 00:43.083
Can it slice through a bulldozer?
I didn't hear you say "bulldozer."

00:43.166 --> 00:44.250
Not falling for it.

00:44.333 --> 00:47.333
I don't care how hard you try,
there is no way...

00:47.417 --> 00:48.792
How do you like your 'dozer?

00:48.875 --> 00:51.208
Sliced, diced. Shoe string, waffle cut?

00:51.291 --> 00:53.667
-O'Brien?

00:53.750 --> 00:57.000
Yah! (gasps) Oh, no.

00:58.417 --> 01:01.500
No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:01.583 --> 01:04.709
I did tell you it wouldn't
cut through a bulldozer.

01:04.792 --> 01:07.959
I can fix this. Just find a bag
and start scooping.

01:08.041 --> 01:09.417
And, there.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.750
You know, this actually
looked worse than it was.

01:12.917 --> 01:18.166
-(sneezes)
-(gasps) I am so busted.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.917
-(groans)
-Say it was like that when you found it.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.709
(laughing)

01:24.792 --> 01:26.667
You don't even have to say anything.

01:26.750 --> 01:30.333
I broke my sword and I am
really, really sorry.

Cracked blade, cauldron of fire, love it.

01:42.959 --> 01:46.041
-(grunts)
-And I promise I will not break this one!

01:53.709 --> 01:57.625
Ooh! Oh, man. This time I know I did it!

01:59.709 --> 02:01.208
Come on, give them here.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.417
-Ow!
-(grunts)

02:06.500 --> 02:08.667
-Try again, Brent.
-Ooh.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.709
How am I supposed to
master the ancient art of metalwork,

02:12.792 --> 02:15.000
if all I'm making is corn holders?

02:15.083 --> 02:18.917
Boy, you ain't making no corn holders,
you making corn droppers.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.500
Why you fussing with corn, anyways?

02:21.583 --> 02:23.458
This ain't no dang old Home Ec.

02:23.542 --> 02:27.625
-Brent, do it again.
-Oh, no. I am done!

02:27.709 --> 02:29.166
I am out of here!

02:29.250 --> 02:32.333
Mmm-mm-mmm. I'm getting
too old for this shop.

02:32.417 --> 02:33.834
(grumbling) Ding-dang corncob.

02:33.917 --> 02:35.667
-Ah!
-Watch it, Weinerman!

02:35.750 --> 02:38.417
Okay, the realm of the ninja
has to be the school,

02:38.500 --> 02:40.834
but where is there a cauldron of fire?

02:40.917 --> 02:43.959
This chili's a cauldron
of fire going in and coming out.

02:44.041 --> 02:46.125
-(belching)
-Aah!

02:46.208 --> 02:47.542
"S. Ward Smith"?

02:47.625 --> 02:50.709
Sword... Smith. Swordsmith!

02:50.792 --> 02:52.542
Oh-uh! Boom!

02:52.625 --> 02:54.083
-Cracked it!
-(burps)

02:54.166 --> 02:57.458
Um, Mr. Smith? Mr. S. Ward Smith?

02:57.542 --> 02:59.709
I'm looking for a swordsmith.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.125
Why you smithing around
my metal shop?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.458
(clears throat) Greetings, swordsmith
of Norrisville, 'tis I...

03:10.542 --> 03:13.709
I know you the Ninja. Caught a whiff of
you the second you walked in.

03:13.792 --> 03:16.000
-Ow!
-You reek of smoke bombs.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.917
Those things smell like farts.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.125
(grunting) Check it out!

03:21.208 --> 03:24.125
-I made dents.
-Mmm, let me get a feel on those.

03:24.208 --> 03:26.083
Mr. Smith wouldn't have
made you his protoge

03:26.166 --> 03:27.500
if he didn't see something in you.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.041
Just apologize
for using your mad words,

03:30.125 --> 03:31.917
and make the best dang
cob holders ever!

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Mmm-hmm. This is some
quality work, son.

03:35.083 --> 03:40.667
He replaced me with... Weinerman!

03:40.750 --> 03:42.875
Quality work? Really?

03:42.959 --> 03:45.500
No, they're dents!
A donkey can do that.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.291
Donkey's can't hold hammers.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.500
And back to the reason I'm here.

03:49.583 --> 03:51.834
So I kinda, sort of, might have, in a way,

03:51.917 --> 03:53.709
in a sense, might have, could have...

03:53.792 --> 03:55.458
You broke your sword, didn't you?

03:55.542 --> 03:56.834
Wait a sec, how did you...?

03:56.917 --> 03:59.667
Ninja swords can cut through
anything, except stupid.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.458
Cut stupid? No, no, no, no.
I wasn't cutting stupid, friend.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.333
I was cutting a bulldozer.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.792
Okay... I see what you're saying.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.458
Bulldozer? No wonder
your sword broke.

04:09.542 --> 04:12.208
Ninja weapons
are for ninja business.

04:12.291 --> 04:15.125
-(gasps)
-Learn how to honor your tools.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.375
So Bruce! Whoa.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.959
Stupid Weinerman. (crying)

04:23.250 --> 04:26.250
-Listen to that.
-(squeaking)

04:26.333 --> 04:28.792
The muted thud of rejection.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.417
The angry clank of failure.

04:31.500 --> 04:36.083
All coming together
in a glorious symphony of shame.

04:36.166 --> 04:40.542
-(clanging continues)
-Hang on. Here comes my favorite part.

04:40.625 --> 04:44.250
-(loud clang)
-Exquisite.

04:48.041 --> 04:51.709
Mmm? (shouting)

04:53.750 --> 04:56.000
(roars)

04:56.083 --> 04:59.166
I've been crafting swords
for the ninja my whole life.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.834
When used properly,

05:00.917 --> 05:03.000
a swordsmith signature
sword is the most

05:03.083 --> 05:04.959
powerful weapon
in the ninja's arsenal.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.041
Totally.
I was thinking my new sword

05:07.125 --> 05:10.333
should have two blades,
a touch screen and Wi-Fi.

05:10.417 --> 05:14.291
-Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi. (grumbles)
-(laughing)

05:21.667 --> 05:24.291
Um, that's a clown balloon.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.834
-That better?
-No!

05:26.917 --> 05:29.792
That's not better, that's worse!
I'm a ninja. I need a real sword.

05:29.875 --> 05:32.834
Ninjas get swords, clowns get balloons.

05:32.917 --> 05:36.208
Until you prove to me
you can be responsible for your weapons,

05:36.291 --> 05:39.166
-this is your sword.
-No problem.

05:39.250 --> 05:42.333
I can be responsible for a balloon,
that's baby stuff.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.959
So... I'm gonna need
another sword, please.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.834
Cunningham, you're my best friend,

05:49.917 --> 05:52.917
but no way can you handle
an assignment this heavy.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.375
Please, I'm a ninja.

05:55.458 --> 05:58.041
I can keep a balloon from popping.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.667
-Seriously?
-(groans)

06:00.875 --> 06:03.667
New rule: Don't get the sword near
anything that'll pop it.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.792
Okay, class. Who's ready...

06:05.875 --> 06:07.834
...for blindfolded archery?

06:08.875 --> 06:10.375
(both) Hmm?

06:11.083 --> 06:14.125
See, Howard? Responsible. Me.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.625
Hey, a balloon! I'm gonna pop it!

06:18.709 --> 06:20.083
-No!
-(balloon pops)

06:20.166 --> 06:22.208
I'm starting to think
you don't even want a sword.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.750
(groans)

06:24.709 --> 06:27.792
(growling)

06:28.959 --> 06:31.041
Yeah. (cackling)

06:32.875 --> 06:35.625
New, new rule:
I'm not letting go of this balloon.

06:35.709 --> 06:37.208
No matter what.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.291
As a special treat,
we're going to spend

06:39.375 --> 06:41.458
a fascinating 45 minutes

06:41.542 --> 06:44.875
walking through the poorly lit
and completely unmarked

06:44.959 --> 06:47.834
Norrisville High cactus maze.

06:49.250 --> 06:53.291
It's a-maz-ingly educational.

06:53.917 --> 06:55.125
Hmm?

06:55.625 --> 06:58.000
(Randy) This isn't that bad.
I was wrong! There's so many...

06:58.542 --> 07:01.458
So many pointy things! All
of them hurt all over my body!

07:01.542 --> 07:04.792
Aah, my balloon!
My balloon is all I care about!

07:04.875 --> 07:06.750
Howard, do not push me.
Howard! Ooh!

07:06.834 --> 07:09.709
Now I'm gonna push you... I missed!
I missed and my face is touching it.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.166
Mmm-mm-mm.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.792
I'm gonna do it. Ow.
I'm gonna show Ward Smith

07:13.875 --> 07:16.083
that I'm not an
irresponsible shoob. Ow.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.709
And I'm gonna get
that new sword. (groans)

07:18.792 --> 07:22.125
Which is why I promise
nothing will happen to you.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.500
This is painful.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.291
You know you're
talking to a balloon, right?

07:25.375 --> 07:28.333
It's not a balloon, Howard.
It is my sword,

07:29.041 --> 07:31.417
and it is my responsibility.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.375
Could you do that at another table,

07:34.458 --> 07:37.583
'cause you're kind of
weirding me out. (yelling)

07:37.667 --> 07:40.792
(growling) Weinerman!

07:41.667 --> 07:45.333
-(shouting)
-(panting, gasps)

07:48.166 --> 07:50.834
Don't worry. I'm coming for you, buddy.

07:52.667 --> 07:55.083
-(growling)
-(screams)

07:56.834 --> 07:59.583
You have no skill.

07:59.667 --> 08:03.000
I don't know what you're talking about,
but it's probably true.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.583
-(grunting)
-(Howard screaming)

08:06.875 --> 08:07.792
(rumbling)

08:07.875 --> 08:10.000
-(growling)
-(shuddering)

08:11.834 --> 08:14.792
-(yelling)
-Me apprentice!

08:14.875 --> 08:17.959
Him not apprentice.

08:18.041 --> 08:20.000
How come you have
such trouble with grammar,

08:20.083 --> 08:22.750
-but you can say "apprentice."
-Ninja leap!

08:22.834 --> 08:24.709
Tell me you're not
going to fight with a balloon!

08:24.792 --> 08:26.834
Howard, I'm not going to
fight this guy with a balloon.

08:26.917 --> 08:28.417
What are you going to fight him with?

08:28.500 --> 08:31.500
The heart and soul
of a responsible ninja.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.542
Oh, great, I'm dead. I'm dead.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.458
Ninja flash!

08:38.917 --> 08:41.500
-Ninja-size.!
-(growling)

08:44.500 --> 08:46.458
Yah! Hi-yah!

08:46.542 --> 08:49.959
-(growling)
-(grunts) Ah...

08:50.041 --> 08:53.542
Ninja comet.
Ninja chain-sicle.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.959
-(growls)
-Uh... Ninja rings?

09:00.166 --> 09:02.250
What the juice? Nothing's working.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.750
I could really use a sword right now.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.250
(ward) <i>Until you prove to me</i>
<i>you can be responsible</i>

09:06.333 --> 09:09.291
- <i>for your weapons...</i>
-This is my sword.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.458
-Ninja...
-Uh...

09:11.542 --> 09:13.250
(growling)

09:14.917 --> 09:17.458
Yah! Ninja bat!

09:19.291 --> 09:22.375
Feel the inflated wrath
of my ninja sword.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.417
Ninja, what do you
think you're doing?

09:25.500 --> 09:26.917
I know what you were telling me.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.291
This is my sword,
and I'm gonna ninja with it.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.125
What? That's not a sword,
it's a metaphor.

09:33.208 --> 09:34.917
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.792
Oh, no. I wasn't
behaving like a clown,

09:39.875 --> 09:42.000
I was behaving like a ninja,
and you all saw it.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.333
-All you guys saw it.
-No duh.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.250
Why do you think
I made you this?

09:49.709 --> 09:51.792
Yeah!

09:53.250 --> 09:57.000
Ah, yes! So Bruce!

09:57.083 --> 09:59.750
Now that sword would
cut through a bulldozer.

09:59.834 --> 10:00.709
Yeah, it would.

10:00.792 --> 10:02.959
Don't even think about it!
Now get in there

10:03.041 --> 10:04.583
-and poke that monster!
-(growling)

10:07.083 --> 10:09.667
Let's do this. Yah!

10:11.834 --> 10:13.250
(shouting)

10:14.500 --> 10:15.750
(yells)

10:18.625 --> 10:20.458
I'll be slicing that.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.875
-Yah. Yah!
-(grunting)

10:27.583 --> 10:28.583
Ho-ho-ho!

10:31.166 --> 10:34.959
(moaning) Hey. Hello?

10:36.542 --> 10:38.291
No, no, no. No, no.

10:38.375 --> 10:42.041
-No. No!
-(squeaking)

10:45.625 --> 10:48.500
Howard, I'm never
abusing my sword again.

10:48.583 --> 10:51.208
From now on, the ninja
sword is for ninja business.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.667
Yeah... Besides,
these are way better.

10:53.750 --> 10:54.834
Hmm?

10:54.917 --> 10:56.709
You better not be toasting marshmallows

10:56.792 --> 10:59.834
-over my sacred fire pit.
-(both) Run!

11:02.500 --> 11:05.375
This is big, Cunningham.
first day of Home Ec.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.250
We're already partners in
Science, Gym, Spanish and lunch.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.709
When we're officially
logged as baking buddies,

11:10.792 --> 11:13.083
we'll be partners in every class!

11:13.166 --> 11:17.417
We will have achieved
the freshman class-fecta.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.041
You guys are idiots.

11:21.583 --> 11:24.709
(speaking gibberish)

11:27.500 --> 11:29.291
I took the liberty,
hope you don't mind.

11:29.375 --> 11:33.041
Those are ridiculously awesome!

11:33.959 --> 11:36.542
After you, Chef Cunningham.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.834
Oh, no, no, no.
Chef Weinerman, I insist.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.208
(both grunting)

11:42.125 --> 11:44.208
Greetings, fellow foodies.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.542
Mr. D's teaching a few classes,

11:46.625 --> 11:49.750
so he can take me
on a tan line optional cruise.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.667
Don't tell him I know,
it's supposed to be a surprise.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.709
That skeleton's gonna
teach us how to cook?

11:55.792 --> 11:59.083
Well, she sure isn't.
Look at me, I'm all bones!

11:59.166 --> 12:02.250
(chuckling) Delicious zing, Mr. D.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.583
Before you pick your baking buddies,

12:04.667 --> 12:08.375
I'd like to introduce our
foreign exchange student.

12:08.458 --> 12:12.750
Put your oven mitts together
for the new kid, Franz Nukid.

12:16.041 --> 12:19.625
I am Franz. I was just enrolled
in your education factory.

12:19.709 --> 12:22.083
-Hallo.
-(crickets chirping)

12:22.166 --> 12:24.250
Now you say "hallo."

12:25.792 --> 12:27.000
-Um...
-Hello.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.208
-Hi.
-Or something.

12:28.291 --> 12:30.458
That was excellent "hallo."

12:30.542 --> 12:32.250
That guy is so weird.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.709
What is up with that shoobtastic hat?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.834
Howard, he's new. Give him a chance.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.750
Not everybody has it
as locked down as we do.

12:41.834 --> 12:45.542
Let's get rolling. Time
to pick your baking buddies.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.458
-What are you doing?
-NinjaNomicon. It could be important.

12:51.542 --> 12:55.250
Nothing is more important
than the class-fecta.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.041
Tell Mr. D we're partners.
I don't have to be there for that.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.333
Just wait two seconds,

13:00.417 --> 13:02.709
buddy up with me,
then go into the book.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.500
-Give me the Nomicon.
-No.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.834
-Give me the Nomicon.
-(grunting)

13:07.917 --> 13:11.417
-Class-fecta.
-Class-fecta isn't a real thing.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.500
(gasps)

13:12.583 --> 13:14.959
I'm the Ninja. I like being the Ninja.

13:15.041 --> 13:17.083
It's my duty, but I wouldn't expect

13:17.166 --> 13:19.542
you to understand what
it means to have a duty.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.500
One, (laughs), duty.

13:21.583 --> 13:25.166
-And, two... How dare you?
-Whatever.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.375
(grunts)

13:29.542 --> 13:31.166
What the juice, Nomicon?

13:31.250 --> 13:34.083
Howard is so wrong on this one. Right?

13:34.166 --> 13:37.834
"The most dangerous enemy often
wears the mask of an ally."

13:40.875 --> 13:41.834
Ha!

13:43.458 --> 13:47.333
Thank you. Howard is totally
being a huge enemy right now.

13:47.417 --> 13:50.333
The second I (gust) out of here,
I'm gonna tell that guy what's up.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.792
-(chuckling)
-Ah, what's up?

13:55.250 --> 13:57.583
(screams, grunts)

13:57.667 --> 14:00.417
(Franz) I will just look
in this cabinet for the dill weed.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.375
Hey, you found the dill weed.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.166
Hallo!

14:07.625 --> 14:10.583
Howard, why is Nukid,
the new kid, wearing my hat?

14:10.667 --> 14:13.667
What new kid? Oh, you mean
my baking buddy, Franz!

14:13.750 --> 14:15.792
Hallo! Now you say, "Hallo."

14:15.875 --> 14:18.375
You just blew the
class-fecta on that guy?

14:18.458 --> 14:21.667
Ho-ho! Look who
suddenly gives a squirt

14:21.750 --> 14:24.166
-about the class-fecta.
-(bell rings)

14:24.250 --> 14:25.583
Howard, the buns are ready, yah?

14:25.667 --> 14:28.542
-(moans)
-Excuse me. I have buns to butter.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.875
-(grumbling)
-(squeaking)

14:34.625 --> 14:36.625
(humming)

14:36.709 --> 14:39.000
What's with all the fuzz, Viceroy?

14:39.083 --> 14:41.166
Mother told me these
shorts were too short.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.709
-I should've listened.
-Ew!

14:42.792 --> 14:44.500
And I was talking about them!

14:44.583 --> 14:47.917
Oh, that. That's my latest
plan to take down the ninja.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.125
It doesn't seem very deadly.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.458
It's the exact opposite of deadly.

14:53.709 --> 14:56.625
Through genetic engineering,
I extracted the adorability

14:56.709 --> 15:01.041
of a bunny, the naiveté of a koala,
and the weaselyness of a weasel.

15:01.125 --> 15:05.083
Then I encoded it into
a robotic exchange student!

15:06.709 --> 15:08.750
(yawning) I'm sorry.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.917
I must've checked out
during the part where

15:11.000 --> 15:12.625
you talked about destroying the ninja!

15:12.709 --> 15:15.959
He's not a destroy-bot,
he's a befriend-bot.

15:16.041 --> 15:16.917
Hallo!

15:17.000 --> 15:20.333
Thanks to his extremely high LQ,
or lovability quotient,

15:20.417 --> 15:22.542
my robot will have
no trouble collecting

15:22.625 --> 15:25.166
voice samples from
every student at Norrisville.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.625
Then, we compare the voices

15:27.709 --> 15:30.500
to the sample we have
on file for the ninja.

15:30.583 --> 15:35.583
Say hello to my ninja eye poke!
Say hello to my ninja eye poke!

15:35.667 --> 15:39.041
Once we find a match,
we'll know who the ninja is.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.375
-And then we'll destroy him?
-And then we destroy him.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.834
Ooh! This is my best plan yet!

15:44.917 --> 15:48.041
Please, sir. You're scaring the koala.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.792
-(laughing)
-Makes me think that some people can't...

15:50.875 --> 15:52.125
...the way that they say they can.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.917
I'm Franz Nukid. Hallo.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.166
-Now you say "hallo."
-Uh! Oh, me? Hello.

15:58.792 --> 15:59.750
<i>Hello.</i>

15:59.834 --> 16:02.083
(Randy) <i>Say hello</i>
<i>to my ninja eye poke!</i>

16:02.166 --> 16:04.709
(man) <i>Voice match negative. Not the ninja.</i>

16:04.792 --> 16:08.542
-Excellent "hallo." You win!
-I do? Hooray!

16:08.625 --> 16:10.750
I can't help but love this guy.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.417
(all laugh)

16:12.500 --> 16:14.375
Howard, I'm willing to forgive you...
Franz!

16:14.458 --> 16:16.625
Why is Nukid
sitting in my seat?

16:16.709 --> 16:18.834
Oh, this is awkward.

16:18.917 --> 16:23.250
My ex-lunch partner just
caught me with my new lunch partner.

16:23.333 --> 16:26.834
Franz is teaching us
a fascinating game from his homeland.

16:26.917 --> 16:29.041
-So Bruce!
-Now you say "hallo."

16:29.125 --> 16:33.917
-Hallo. Was that okay?
-Okay? It was excellent "hallo."

16:34.000 --> 16:35.792
-You win!
-(laughter)

16:35.875 --> 16:38.333
(grumbles) How could you
replace me with that guy?

16:38.417 --> 16:41.333
Hey! You were busy with
your big, fat, hairy duty.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.166
But me not understand duty,
me stupid.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.125
Me just want friend to eat with.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.834
I am not the one
acting like an enemy here.

16:47.917 --> 16:49.625
You are. The Nomicon even said so.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.917
Well, maybe you
should have lunch with the Nomicon.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.000
I'm gonna go abuse my friend Franz's

16:55.083 --> 16:57.834
exchange student
discount at the snack cart.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.208
(yodeling)

17:00.291 --> 17:02.375
Hey! What are you
supposed to be, huh?

17:02.458 --> 17:03.667
-Tell me!
-(gasps)

17:08.709 --> 17:10.917
I am Franz Nukid. Hallo.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.417
Now you say "hallo."

17:14.750 --> 17:17.875
-Ha-llo?
-That was excellent "hallo."

17:17.959 --> 17:21.041
-You win!
-Yeah! I win.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.166
Ha! I love this guy.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.333
I don't know why, but I love him!
Come here you little munchkin!

17:26.417 --> 17:28.000
(cheering)

17:28.083 --> 17:29.542
-Hallo.
-Hallo.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.041
-Hallo.
-Hallo.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.000
-Hallo.
-Excellent "hallo."

17:33.083 --> 17:34.875
-(laughter)
-Who cares... saying "hallo."

17:34.959 --> 17:36.834
Check, one, two. Two. Check, check.

17:36.917 --> 17:39.208
Oh, hallo! Now you say "hallo."

17:39.291 --> 17:41.792
Franz, I know you think
Howard's your new best friend

17:41.875 --> 17:43.917
and all, but actually
he's my best friend.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.083
We're kind of having a thing right now,
and you got caught up in the middle of it.

17:47.166 --> 17:51.000
So, it'd be the cheese <i>if you could find</i>
<i>someone else to "hallo" with.</i>

17:51.083 --> 17:53.417
<i>(Randy) Say hello to my ninja eye poke!</i>

17:54.583 --> 17:56.333
<i>(man) Ninja identified.</i>

17:56.417 --> 17:58.417
Hallo, ninja.

17:58.500 --> 18:02.083
-What did you just say?
-I said, hello, ninja.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.250
(gasps)

18:04.834 --> 18:06.875
(man) <i>Ninja identified.</i>

18:06.959 --> 18:09.208
<i>-</i> Who is it?
<i>-</i> (man) <i>Ninja identified.</i>

18:09.291 --> 18:10.709
I heard you the first time, who is it?

18:10.792 --> 18:13.333
-(man) <i>Ninja identified.</i>
-Who is the ninja?

18:13.417 --> 18:15.750
<i>(man) Ninja identi... fied.</i>

18:19.125 --> 18:21.792
I just got an alert!
The ninja's been...

18:23.417 --> 18:27.792
-Oh, Hannibal, you didn't.
-It was like this when I found it.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.000
Ah! Send the chainsaw werewolves
to retrieve Franz.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.375
I can rebuild the Franz later...

18:33.458 --> 18:34.917
Send in the chainsaw werewolves!

18:35.000 --> 18:36.792
But I'm not the ninja.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.250
But you are the ninja, I know this.

18:39.333 --> 18:43.083
You told Franz? I can't believe
you're trying to jack my BFF.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.041
No, Howard, he just figured it out.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.041
Franz, okay?
You can't tell anybody.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.125
But I must, it is my duty.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.041
(chuckles) Ah, duty.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.750
(gasps)

18:53.625 --> 18:55.166
(all screaming)

18:58.083 --> 19:00.500
-Oh, hallo.
-Take him to McFist.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.250
They're Franz-napping him!

19:03.333 --> 19:05.709
McFist can force him
to give up my true identity.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.542
This kid doesn't know
how much trouble he's in.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.333
-(grunts)
-(girls scream)

19:09.417 --> 19:10.750
Sorry!

19:12.917 --> 19:14.000
Ninja rings!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.250
(all growling)

19:28.792 --> 19:30.417
(screams)

19:31.875 --> 19:33.750
(yells) <i>Ofta.</i>

19:33.834 --> 19:36.417
See, Franz. This is why
you shouldn't know my secret.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.041
It puts you in danger.

19:38.125 --> 19:41.500
No, ninja. It's you who is in danger.

19:41.583 --> 19:42.917
(both) You're a robot?

19:43.000 --> 19:46.750
<i>"The most dangerous enemy</i>
<i>often wears the mask of an ally."</i>

19:46.834 --> 19:49.834
Oh! You're the enemy the
Nomicon was warning me about.

19:49.917 --> 19:53.083
(clears throat) Anything
you'd like to say to me?

19:53.166 --> 19:54.792
(grunts, yelps)

19:57.667 --> 19:58.917
There. Fixed it.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.583
We can still download
the ninja's true identity.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.208
Well, push it!

20:05.375 --> 20:08.542
Hiyah! (grunts)

20:16.750 --> 20:19.834
McFist is uploading my data. I win!

20:23.166 --> 20:25.667
-(groans)
-(bubbling)

20:25.750 --> 20:27.458
(Howard screams)

20:30.834 --> 20:33.083
-Goodbye, ninja.
-(gasping)

20:33.166 --> 20:34.583
Now you say goodbye.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.125
Hey, Nukid.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.709
Hello, Howard. What are you doing?

20:41.792 --> 20:43.500
I wouldn't expect you
to understand this,

20:43.583 --> 20:47.208
'cause you're a robot,
but I also have a duty as a friend.

20:47.291 --> 20:50.041
Also (laughs) duty.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.959
Yah!

20:54.375 --> 20:56.166
(screaming)

20:56.250 --> 20:57.834
Hallo... Hallo...

20:57.917 --> 21:00.166
(slow-motion) Hallo...

21:02.917 --> 21:05.750
Well, I guess you have to
know the difference

21:05.834 --> 21:08.041
between your Franz and your enemies.

21:08.125 --> 21:11.417
Ugh, too soon, Ninja, too soon.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.250
(grumbling)

21:15.583 --> 21:17.500
The ninja's identity is...

21:17.583 --> 21:19.667
(man) <i>Transmission terminated.</i>

21:21.583 --> 21:24.583
-(grunting)
-(chittering)

21:24.667 --> 21:26.834
Sir, please release the weasel.

21:26.917 --> 21:29.083
(continues grumbling)

21:31.542 --> 21:33.875
Howard, I acted like a total shoob.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.458
I thought my only duty was being
the ninja, but I was wrong.

21:36.542 --> 21:40.083
I have two duties. A ninja duty,
and a best friend duty.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.500
-(chuckling)
-No, you can laugh.

21:41.583 --> 21:42.709
I said "duty" a lot of times.

21:42.792 --> 21:45.792
You did! You said it like 100 times!

21:45.875 --> 21:46.792
It was awesome!

21:46.875 --> 21:49.500
Hey, so what do you say?
Baking buddies?

21:52.375 --> 21:55.750
-(both) Class-fecta!
-(ringing)

21:59.834 --> 22:01.959
(scoffs) You guys are idiots.

22:03.208 --> 22:05.417
(theme music playing)
