00:17.855 --> 00:19.588
No. No, I'm sorry.

00:19.589 --> 00:21.089
It was just the first thing

00:21.091 --> 00:22.625
that popped into my
head when you picked up.

00:22.626 --> 00:23.925
I'm calling because, uh,

00:23.926 --> 00:25.094
I'm being blackmailed.

00:25.094 --> 00:26.361
Blackmailed by Camomile White

00:26.362 --> 00:29.030
to help her with her
stupid reality TV show.

00:29.032 --> 00:30.765
Oh, is she tryin' to use
you to talk to ghosts?

00:30.766 --> 00:33.335
Well, no. She's using
me to keep ghosts away,

00:33.337 --> 00:35.070
so she can pretend to talk to ghosts.

00:35.072 --> 00:36.271
What... what do I do?

00:36.273 --> 00:38.374
Tell that skinny bitch no!

00:38.375 --> 00:40.375
No, no. I'm afraid not, Roofie.

00:40.377 --> 00:41.944

00:41.945 --> 00:43.345
the worst N-word I could use.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.314
It's not. It's not.

00:45.314 --> 00:47.250
It is. Trust me.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.884
Oh, yo, what does she have on you?

00:48.886 --> 00:50.753
Oh, well, that's...

00:50.753 --> 00:52.655
that's sort of where it gets interesting.

00:52.655 --> 00:56.325
I, uh, kinda sorta accidentally told her

00:56.326 --> 00:58.127
that I kept Sue from
walking into her light.

00:58.128 --> 00:59.594
And it wouldn't be so bad

00:59.595 --> 01:01.164
if I hadn't sorta kinda done it

01:01.164 --> 01:03.064
in front of her video camera?

01:03.066 --> 01:05.268
Look, here's what you do, okay?

01:05.269 --> 01:06.668
Come clean, all right?

01:06.670 --> 01:07.837
Tell Sue the truth,

01:07.837 --> 01:09.105
and Camomile has nothing on you.

01:09.105 --> 01:10.338
Ooh, the truth

01:10.340 --> 01:12.307
is some risky business, Roofie.

Dude, if she loves you,

01:13.676 --> 01:14.944
she'll forgive you man.

01:14.944 --> 01:15.844

01:15.846 --> 01:16.912

01:31.728 --> 01:33.862
Look. Just be honest with Sue, okay?

01:33.864 --> 01:35.230
The difference in your relationship...

01:35.231 --> 01:36.831
- will be like...
- Knight and Day.

01:36.832 --> 01:39.001
