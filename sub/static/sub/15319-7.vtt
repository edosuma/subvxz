00:13.564 --> 00:15.000
Okay, seriously, guys!

00:15.002 --> 00:17.995
I already can't feel my toes!

00:17.997 --> 00:20.862
We have to get inside!

00:20.864 --> 00:23.598
This wind's going to kill us!

00:36.603 --> 00:37.536
Give it a try.

00:42.949 --> 00:44.451
No, not going to happen.

00:44.453 --> 00:45.685
Alistair!

00:45.687 --> 00:47.321
Could you two just...

00:47.323 --> 00:49.289
What, HAP?

00:49.291 --> 00:51.491
In this?
Dude, I need these clothes!

00:51.493 --> 00:53.759
Maybe just halfway.

00:53.761 --> 00:55.761
With both of us.

00:55.763 --> 00:57.529
Yeah? All right.

01:07.607 --> 01:08.975
You ready?

01:08.977 --> 01:09.810
Yeah.

01:29.805 --> 01:31.105
Seriously!

01:31.107 --> 01:32.507
What the hell was that?

01:32.509 --> 01:35.076
One minute it's a nice
leisurely Skidoo ride

01:35.078 --> 01:36.711
to an abandoned Icebreaker,

01:36.713 --> 01:39.046
the next it's minus 50
and a Dr. Zhivago snow storm.

01:39.048 --> 01:40.981
This is
the Barents Sea, Henry.

01:40.983 --> 01:43.083
We're only about 700 miles
from the North Pole.

01:43.085 --> 01:44.017
Oh, I see.

01:44.019 --> 01:45.419
Does that mean

01:45.421 --> 01:47.054
that weather doesn't have
to follow the rules?

01:47.056 --> 01:48.690
We knew the
storm was coming.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.726
It just took us
longer to get here

01:49.728 --> 01:50.993
than we'd planned.

01:50.995 --> 01:52.362
We hunker down

01:52.364 --> 01:53.897
and get as much
exploring done as we can

01:53.899 --> 01:55.900
until Magnus' plane
gets here.

01:55.902 --> 01:57.268
In this weather?

01:57.270 --> 01:59.605
She won't be able to
leave the ground till tomorrow.

01:59.607 --> 02:01.775
Well, then we'll make do
with what's here.

02:01.777 --> 02:03.109
All right, well,

02:03.111 --> 02:05.980
dibs on the first
Tauntaun we find.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.828
Well, this isn't so bad,

02:18.830 --> 02:19.862
and it's far more intact

02:19.864 --> 02:22.064
than it looked
in the satellite photos.

02:27.004 --> 02:29.071
Hey, Murray,
how's your Russian?

02:31.142 --> 02:33.577
Boatswain's locker.

02:40.851 --> 02:43.086
Whoa.

02:43.088 --> 02:44.087
Dead guy.

02:44.089 --> 02:45.856
We've got something.

03:03.211 --> 03:05.613
Gunshot wound, close range.

03:08.718 --> 03:10.819
Possibly self inflicted.

03:10.821 --> 03:12.054
Viper G-17.

03:12.056 --> 03:14.123
The latest and greatest
close combat rifle

03:14.125 --> 03:15.191
on the market.

03:15.193 --> 03:17.227
What's that kind
of weapon doing here?

03:19.597 --> 03:21.465
I'm guessing
our Russian smugglers

03:21.467 --> 03:24.668
were moving something more
than just abnormals.

03:27.872 --> 03:29.773
Wow.

03:29.775 --> 03:31.107
Or they were expecting

03:31.109 --> 03:33.243
some serious trouble.

03:33.245 --> 03:36.746
Let's check out
the rest of the ship.

03:57.068 --> 03:58.769
The bridge should be
just up there.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.180
You okay?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.314
It's not
my first dead body,

04:10.316 --> 04:12.717
it's just...

04:12.719 --> 04:15.554
More raw than
in the Sanctuary labs?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.923
I certainly haven't
gotten used to it.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.726
I don't want you to,
Alistair.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.930
That's not
why you joined us.

04:23.932 --> 04:24.763
Ready?

04:32.905 --> 04:34.972
More bodies in here.

04:36.541 --> 04:37.575
My God...

05:02.135 --> 05:05.637
This explains why
the ship ran aground.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.039
Multiple
gunshot wounds.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.607
Single bullet here.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.141
Ditto.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.943
Same here.

05:13.912 --> 05:15.279
From the pattern
of the body falls,

05:15.281 --> 05:16.781
I'd say this was
a Mexican standoff

05:16.783 --> 05:17.748
that ended badly.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.116
They killed each other?

05:19.118 --> 05:21.251
It looks like it.

05:21.253 --> 05:22.586
My intel says

05:22.588 --> 05:23.953
there was
a skeleton crew of ten.

05:23.955 --> 05:25.321
They were traveling light,

05:25.323 --> 05:26.623
just enough to keep this tug
moving through the ice

05:26.625 --> 05:27.924
'round the clock.

05:27.926 --> 05:29.793
Nine bodies
in a Tarantino dance party,

05:29.795 --> 05:32.062
one downstairs in a locker.

05:32.064 --> 05:33.197
Yeah, who looks like

05:33.199 --> 05:34.632
he might have
killed himself as well.

05:34.634 --> 05:36.301
So, what's the punchline?

05:37.770 --> 05:39.404
Russian smugglers

05:39.406 --> 05:40.839
put a container full of
Hollow Earth abnormals...

05:40.841 --> 05:42.741
And a few crates of guns.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.809
And a few
crates of guns

05:43.811 --> 05:45.277
on board an old Icebreaker

05:45.279 --> 05:47.045
approximately
two months ago.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.613
They head out to sea
from the Ostrovnoy port?

05:49.615 --> 05:50.981
Yeah.

05:50.983 --> 05:51.782
Our Sanctuary picks up
a lead on the buyer,

05:51.784 --> 05:53.317
we're all set to take them down,

05:53.319 --> 05:54.685
but then the ship
never turns up.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.120
I tracked every possible route
given the original bearings,

05:57.122 --> 05:59.089
but there's no sign of it,
anywhere.

05:59.091 --> 06:00.723
Because they fell asleep
at the wheel,

06:00.725 --> 06:02.191
they crashed the ship,

06:02.193 --> 06:04.993
and they're so mad at each other
they kill themselves?

06:04.995 --> 06:07.029
There's got to be
more to it.

06:07.031 --> 06:09.965
What about the abnormals?

06:13.102 --> 06:14.269
Right.

06:14.271 --> 06:15.504
Terry, why don't you
come with me.

06:15.506 --> 06:16.639
We'll go see
what's in the cargo hold?

06:16.641 --> 06:19.442
Henry, you and Murray
head down below decks,

06:19.444 --> 06:22.879
see what state the generators
and boiler are in.

06:22.881 --> 06:24.314
Alistair, see if you can
get a radio working

06:24.316 --> 06:27.418
that will punch through
the storm to update Magnus.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.720
I think we're going
to be here for some time.

07:08.925 --> 07:11.827
We knew this wasn't going
to be a rescue mission.

07:11.829 --> 07:13.862
I know,

07:13.864 --> 07:14.997
but when those
Hollow Earth abnormals

07:14.999 --> 07:16.031
asked us for help,

07:16.033 --> 07:18.033
I thought we'd won
a small victory.

07:18.035 --> 07:20.269
Then these guys
grabbed them.

07:20.271 --> 07:22.338
Yeah.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.043
There it is.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.798
Oh, my God.

♪ ♪

08:06.952 --> 08:09.019
No evidence of gunfire.

08:09.021 --> 08:11.889
This was a tooth
and claw massacre.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.957
It looks like
they turned on each other.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.926
What, when they finally
ran out of food?

08:15.928 --> 08:18.861
Most of these boxes
are rations.

08:18.863 --> 08:20.964
There's evidence
of a fight,

08:20.966 --> 08:22.265
but it was short-lived.

08:22.267 --> 08:24.333
So these guys
tore each other apart

08:24.335 --> 08:26.503
while the crew was in a gunfight
up on the bridge.

08:29.374 --> 08:30.941
Any luck with the radios?

08:30.943 --> 08:34.078
I managed to get the power up,
but there's no signal in or out.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.780
I'm sure the antenna
have all been crushed

08:35.782 --> 08:36.815
by the weight of the ice.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.350
We can rig something
up for short range,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.019
but there's no way it's going
to penetrate this storm.

08:40.020 --> 08:40.919
No.

08:40.922 --> 08:42.321
And what about light and heat?

08:42.323 --> 08:44.155
The main generators
run off the engines,

08:44.158 --> 08:45.391
and those were badly bruised

08:45.393 --> 08:47.426
when this tub rammed its face
into the rocks.

08:47.428 --> 08:48.928
We should be able to run
an auxiliary

08:48.930 --> 08:50.529
without too much
trouble, though.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.165
Yeah, there's still a bit
of fuel left in the tanks,

08:52.167 --> 08:54.100
so I should be able to get
one of the boilers going.

08:54.102 --> 08:55.534
Now, everything's shifted
off its mounts,

08:55.536 --> 08:57.002
but I'm hoping
that doesn't prove to be

08:57.004 --> 08:58.170
too much of a threat.

08:58.172 --> 08:59.404
All right.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.572
You give her a hand
with forensics in here.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.806
I'll see what I can figure out
on the bridge.

09:06.578 --> 09:08.913
I have a bad feeling
about this.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.416
It may just turn out
to be a huge gravesite.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.219
We'll figure out
what we can here for Magnus

09:13.221 --> 09:14.386
and get out.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.821
Back in the snow?

09:15.823 --> 09:17.256
That's not making me
feel any happier.

09:17.258 --> 09:19.391
Steady on, mate.

09:25.466 --> 09:27.833
I could understand
how human beings could do it.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.001
I spent eight years
in the SAS

09:29.003 --> 09:30.904
before I left
to work with Declan.

09:30.906 --> 09:33.272
The things I've seen men
do to each other...

09:33.274 --> 09:35.208
I prefer to work
with abnormals.

09:35.210 --> 09:37.009
And this group
knew each other.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.545
I mean, they came up from
Hollow Earth together,

09:38.547 --> 09:40.546
they survived on the
surface together.

09:40.548 --> 09:43.650
Why would they suddenly
turn on one another?

09:43.652 --> 09:45.084
Maybe it was something viral,

09:45.086 --> 09:48.021
something in the water
or in the air.

09:48.023 --> 09:49.422
You know, Magnus was infected
with this thing once.

09:49.424 --> 09:51.024
It started with
a whole pod of mermaids

09:51.026 --> 09:52.558
trying to tear
themselves apart.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.460
She went down to
figure out what happened,

09:54.462 --> 09:55.494
and then when the thing
got a hold of her,

09:55.496 --> 09:57.530
it made her want to kill Will.

09:57.532 --> 09:59.165
Which, you know,
I kind of understand.

09:59.167 --> 10:00.933
I've felt like that myself
a few times,

10:00.935 --> 10:02.268
but never because of the water.

10:02.270 --> 10:03.870
Could that be what
we are up against here?

10:03.872 --> 10:06.372
Well, that was underwater.

10:06.374 --> 10:07.640
It had a lot to do with
atmospherics

10:07.642 --> 10:09.209
and pressure changes.

10:09.211 --> 10:11.110
I don't think that thing could
survive in this environment.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.012
Yeah, well, if we don't
get this working,

10:13.014 --> 10:14.214
I'm not sure how much
longer <i> we</i> can survive

10:14.216 --> 10:15.148
in this environment.

10:16.384 --> 10:17.417
Yeah...

10:44.009 --> 10:45.409
31.

10:45.411 --> 10:46.444
That accounts for

10:46.446 --> 10:48.080
all the Hollow Earth
abnormals

10:48.082 --> 10:50.616
that contacted you.

10:51.886 --> 10:55.087
What are we supposed
to do now, Alistair?

10:55.089 --> 10:57.590
I'm cold and I'm frightened.

10:57.592 --> 10:59.426
We should sink this ship
and call the mission.

10:59.428 --> 11:00.961
No, I'm afraid we're stuck here

11:00.963 --> 11:03.397
until the storm lets up,
my love.

11:03.399 --> 11:06.700
And there's the mystery
of what happened here.

11:06.702 --> 11:09.202
Aren't you curious?

11:09.204 --> 11:13.273
I'm a Xenobiologist.
It's my job to be curious.

11:13.275 --> 11:15.141
But in the face
of this kind of brutality,

11:15.143 --> 11:18.244
I'm afraid I've lost
my taste for it.

11:18.246 --> 11:19.946
Oh, come here.

11:24.018 --> 11:27.087
It'll all be okay.

11:31.259 --> 11:32.526
Suck it, Tesla.

11:32.528 --> 11:34.228
Let there be light!

11:40.536 --> 11:42.470
I am the God of hellfire.

11:47.676 --> 11:50.512
Slight gas build-up.

11:51.547 --> 11:54.682
Sealed room,
two months of leakage.

11:54.684 --> 11:57.652
They don't teach you that
in special soldier school?

12:00.288 --> 12:03.390
Instant heat,
almost electricity.

12:03.392 --> 12:07.495
This Icebreaker is
practically back in service.

12:16.406 --> 12:19.675
Nine guys, nine guns all
pointing at one another.

12:19.677 --> 12:21.511
The math alone
is enough to kill you.

12:21.513 --> 12:22.645
<i>All finished down here</i>.

12:22.647 --> 12:24.314
<i>Just closing up the doors</i>

12:24.316 --> 12:25.716
<i>unless there's something else</i>
<i>you need.</i>

12:40.598 --> 12:42.065
Gentlemen.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.100
Magnus?

12:44.102 --> 12:45.269
How the hell
did you get here?

12:47.140 --> 12:50.308
I am never, ever
flying with her again!

12:50.310 --> 12:52.076
I think she took
flying lessons from Yoda

12:52.078 --> 12:53.478
in her time off!

12:53.480 --> 12:55.180
The dials
are all going like this,

12:55.182 --> 12:56.648
she's got her eyes closed.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.818
She's got this whole
force thing going on!

12:58.820 --> 13:00.119
And none of the ice
pilots at longyear

13:00.121 --> 13:02.055
were prepared to go out
in this, then?

13:02.057 --> 13:03.357
I practically
had to buy the plane

13:03.359 --> 13:04.558
to get the keys
out of their hands.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.559
The tower never gave us

13:05.561 --> 13:06.794
clearance to take off,

13:06.796 --> 13:08.562
and we almost crashed,

13:08.564 --> 13:10.364
twice!

13:11.667 --> 13:13.768
The entire crew?

13:13.770 --> 13:14.836
Yeah, apart from one.

13:14.838 --> 13:17.239
You probably passed him
on your way up.

13:17.241 --> 13:18.507
All of them died

13:18.509 --> 13:19.842
of close-range
gunshot wounds.

13:19.844 --> 13:21.177
They killed
each other?

13:21.179 --> 13:23.212
The one downstairs
killed himself.

13:23.214 --> 13:24.546
And the abnormals?

13:24.548 --> 13:26.315
They're all dead,
Dr. Magnus.

13:26.317 --> 13:27.482
They tore each other apart.

13:27.484 --> 13:28.783
I'm so sorry.

13:28.785 --> 13:30.751
How did you two
get here?

13:30.753 --> 13:31.819
Ah, badass pilot.

13:31.821 --> 13:33.320
Not-so-badass passenger,

13:33.322 --> 13:35.422
probably screamed like
a little girl the whole way.

13:35.424 --> 13:36.723
No.

13:36.725 --> 13:38.825
Not the whole way.

13:38.827 --> 13:40.560
I've flown in all kinds
of weather, Magnus,

13:40.562 --> 13:42.629
but I'd never think
of going out in this.

13:42.631 --> 13:44.130
I'm amazed
the plane's still intact.

13:44.132 --> 13:45.598
Oh, there's a strut
that needs replacing

13:45.600 --> 13:46.599
before she'll fly again.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.137
Was there any indication

13:50.139 --> 13:51.605
that the abnormals had
anything to do

13:51.607 --> 13:52.506
with what happened
here?

13:52.508 --> 13:53.975
Doubtful.

13:53.977 --> 13:56.377
The door to the cargo hold
was locked from the outside.

13:56.379 --> 13:58.480
All 31 of them
were in there when they died.

13:58.482 --> 14:00.649
Well, that accounts for
the Hollow Earth abnormals,

14:00.651 --> 14:03.452
but wasn't there some rumor
of something more on board?

14:03.454 --> 14:04.887
They might have been
running guns as well.

14:04.889 --> 14:06.389
We found a few crates

14:06.391 --> 14:08.156
of military-grade weapons
down below.

14:08.158 --> 14:09.491
Didn't these guys
have access

14:09.493 --> 14:11.193
to some of the priority
Red List Abnormals

14:11.195 --> 14:12.761
before the Hollow
Earthers came along?

14:12.763 --> 14:15.730
Yeah, that's what put them
on our radar in the first place.

14:15.732 --> 14:17.166
They were rumors
we couldn't substantiate.

14:17.168 --> 14:20.302
All right, we've got
two sets of bodies in two rooms,

14:20.304 --> 14:21.337
and no culprit.

14:21.339 --> 14:22.838
I think it would
be prudent

14:22.840 --> 14:24.774
to search
the entire ship, yes?

14:24.776 --> 14:26.643
Agreed. Two teams.

14:26.645 --> 14:29.312
I'll take you, Terry,
and Henry below decks.

14:29.314 --> 14:30.780
Murray, take will
and Alistair.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.149
Start topside and
work your way down.

14:38.189 --> 14:39.790
Priority Red Listers?

14:39.792 --> 14:41.792
Very bad monsters

14:41.794 --> 14:43.927
would explain the need
for the guns downstairs.

15:14.257 --> 15:16.458
Dear lord.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.640
Shine your light
along the side.

15:34.477 --> 15:35.577
They are all identical.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.915
Henry, the
thermal scanner.

15:55.465 --> 15:57.532
Doc, what are they?

15:57.534 --> 15:59.668
I have no idea,

15:59.670 --> 16:01.770
but they're definitely alive.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.120
If we don't know
what they are,

16:13.121 --> 16:14.995
I don't think
we should move them.

16:14.996 --> 16:16.495
Well, we won't be able
to figure out what they are

16:16.497 --> 16:17.862
until we do, Henry.

16:17.864 --> 16:19.130
The uniformity
of the ice blocks

16:19.132 --> 16:20.498
would suggest
that they might be

16:20.500 --> 16:22.734
in some sort of
hibernation nest.

16:22.736 --> 16:24.068
Yeah, but were they
hibernating

16:24.070 --> 16:26.538
before or after
the showdown on the bridge?

16:26.540 --> 16:29.541
Ah, this will do.
We'll set up here.

16:29.543 --> 16:30.943
The way this ship
is heating up,

16:30.945 --> 16:33.245
they won't stay frozen
for long.

16:33.247 --> 16:36.249
Well, maybe we should
shut down the boiler.

16:36.251 --> 16:37.684
Get it cold in here again.

16:37.686 --> 16:38.519
We can't forget,

16:38.521 --> 16:41.255
it's "Priority
Red List" here.

16:41.257 --> 16:42.523
We could just
leave them out onto the deck.

16:42.525 --> 16:43.591
It's not going to get
any warmer out there.

16:43.593 --> 16:45.193
Yeah, unless moving them at all

16:45.195 --> 16:47.895
hits their internal
"wake up and kill" switch.

16:47.897 --> 16:49.163
There's nothing to suggest
that these creatures

16:49.165 --> 16:51.299
had anything to do with
the slaughter, Henry.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.535
I say we bring one up
and partially thaw it.

16:53.537 --> 16:54.969
At least far enough
to get a biopsy.

16:54.971 --> 16:55.970
I have enough equipment here

16:55.972 --> 16:57.172
that Dr. Magnus and I

16:57.174 --> 16:57.939
can figure out
what we're dealing with.

16:57.941 --> 16:59.241
I'm not convinced

16:59.243 --> 17:01.243
that thawing them here
is the best idea.

17:01.245 --> 17:03.011
You know, once
the storm passes,

17:03.013 --> 17:04.246
you could "crazy-fly" them

17:04.248 --> 17:05.814
back to the Moscow
Sanctuary.

17:05.816 --> 17:06.682
I won't be joining you.

17:06.684 --> 17:08.183
I'll be taking
a snowmobile home.

17:08.185 --> 17:09.752
But moving them
into a populated area

17:09.753 --> 17:10.720
before we know
what they are?

17:10.722 --> 17:11.654
Yeah, it's risky.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.056
I agree.

17:13.058 --> 17:16.760
All right, we'll bring one up,
do a controlled thaw.

17:16.762 --> 17:18.194
We'll work with
what we have.

17:34.946 --> 17:36.613
Will and Henry
are headed to the hold

17:36.615 --> 17:37.814
to cut down
one of the blocks of ice.

17:37.816 --> 17:38.949
Alistair, can you assist?

17:38.951 --> 17:40.117
Sure.

17:40.119 --> 17:41.585
We're going to try

17:41.587 --> 17:42.653
thawing
one of them out.

17:42.655 --> 17:44.154
Not enough to get us
into trouble,

17:44.156 --> 17:45.355
just enough to figure out
what we are up against.

17:45.357 --> 17:46.590
Good idea.

17:46.592 --> 17:47.924
We haven't found any more,

17:47.926 --> 17:49.025
but there's still
the keel hold to check.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.827
And it's a little
easier to move

17:50.829 --> 17:52.129
now that there's
some heat down here,

17:52.131 --> 17:53.697
but I'm wondering

17:53.699 --> 17:55.131
if we should dial back
the runaway boiler a bit.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.667
We don't want to thaw ourselves
into a Red List situation.

17:57.669 --> 17:59.970
I'm on it.

18:01.739 --> 18:03.240
We've set up
a temporary examination room

18:03.242 --> 18:04.574
in the research lab.

18:04.576 --> 18:05.976
We'll call that home base
for now.

18:05.978 --> 18:08.211
I'll finish the sweep
and meet you back there, then.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.779
Right.

18:17.354 --> 18:19.121
It looks so frail.

18:19.123 --> 18:20.355
Certainly
not the kind of thing

18:20.357 --> 18:22.190
that could cause
this kind of carnage.

18:24.393 --> 18:25.727
All right,

18:25.729 --> 18:27.830
keep the lamps
set at low.

18:27.832 --> 18:29.832
Apply the heat packs
in a single line along the top.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.968
Rotate them
every six minutes.

18:31.970 --> 18:33.303
Henry, be ready.

19:05.002 --> 19:06.235
Bloody hell.

19:06.237 --> 19:09.005
<i>Magnus, Will,</i>

19:09.007 --> 19:10.173
<i>I'm in the keel.</i>

19:11.442 --> 19:13.944
I've found another nest,

19:13.946 --> 19:16.412
a bigger one.

19:21.419 --> 19:23.186
That came from below.

19:23.188 --> 19:24.254
The boiler.

19:24.256 --> 19:25.355
Keep working!

19:26.891 --> 19:30.060
Will? Murray?

19:30.062 --> 19:32.363
Declan?

19:35.400 --> 19:37.234
Murray's
in the boiler room!

19:37.236 --> 19:39.103
I sent will down there
to help him out!

19:42.708 --> 19:44.842
I got Declan's call
about the other nest,

19:44.844 --> 19:45.910
so I made a move
for the door,

19:45.912 --> 19:47.812
but Murray
was still there.

19:47.814 --> 19:49.814
He was working on
a gas line.

19:49.816 --> 19:51.349
Dear Lord.

19:59.725 --> 20:02.794
We have to shut
this bloody thing down!

20:16.244 --> 20:18.345
Yeah, I have seen

20:18.347 --> 20:20.347
a lot of things
come back to life,

20:20.349 --> 20:23.885
frozen, drowned,
swallowed, electrocuted,

20:23.887 --> 20:26.253
which happened to me once,
down in Hollow Earth.

20:26.255 --> 20:27.754
You guys probably
read that report, huh?

20:29.023 --> 20:30.123
Yeah, we were done, man,

20:30.125 --> 20:33.293
we were completely
flatlined.

20:33.295 --> 20:36.162
The next thing you know,
we're reanimated,

20:36.164 --> 20:37.196
and we're drinking
diaper-flavored milkshakes

20:37.198 --> 20:39.164
to stop from becoming zombies.

20:40.434 --> 20:42.067
I know, it's completely
unbelievable, right?

20:42.069 --> 20:46.304
The point is, guys,
I'm not a zombie.

20:46.306 --> 20:47.805
Henry,
turn that lamp off.

20:47.807 --> 20:48.806
Help me get
these heat bags off.

20:48.808 --> 20:50.007
Why, what did you see?

20:50.009 --> 20:53.211
Alistair, get
Dr. Magnus now!

20:54.446 --> 20:55.513
The whole
boiler assembly

20:55.515 --> 20:56.614
had come off
its mountings.

20:56.616 --> 20:57.715
It was like...

20:57.717 --> 20:59.116
There's
really nothing

20:59.118 --> 21:00.251
that could have
been done. I'm sorry.

21:00.253 --> 21:01.218
It looks like the guy
didn't stand a chance.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.219
I didn't think

21:02.221 --> 21:03.187
you'd be able to
get an autopsy

21:03.189 --> 21:06.056
until the body
had thawed out more.

21:06.058 --> 21:07.090
Was I right?

21:07.092 --> 21:08.792
They're Migoi.

21:08.794 --> 21:09.893
What?

21:09.895 --> 21:12.462
Wait, Migoi?
As in Hindu Kush Migoi?

21:12.464 --> 21:14.030
The one in
the crashed plane

21:14.032 --> 21:15.131
that almost killed
you and Will

21:15.133 --> 21:16.132
three years ago?

21:16.134 --> 21:17.534
That type of Migoi?

21:17.536 --> 21:19.369
As in "killed by
your own nightmares" Migoi?

21:19.371 --> 21:20.503
You've all read our report,

21:20.505 --> 21:21.904
so you know
what we're up against.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.539
A creature so frail

21:23.541 --> 21:25.875
it can only mount
a mental attack as a defense.

21:25.877 --> 21:27.810
When it felt threatened,
it read our minds

21:27.812 --> 21:29.880
and turned us all
against one another.

21:29.882 --> 21:31.014
Yeah, we had no idea
it was happening

21:31.016 --> 21:32.149
until people started dying.

21:32.151 --> 21:33.918
It can assume any form

21:33.920 --> 21:36.120
and make everyone in the room
see the same thing.

21:36.122 --> 21:37.956
That explains why the crew
turned on itself.

21:37.958 --> 21:39.357
And the abnormals.

21:39.359 --> 21:41.927
Do you think it tricked him
into blowing himself up?

21:41.929 --> 21:42.895
I was within sight of him
the entire time,

21:42.897 --> 21:44.263
right up to the explosion.

21:44.265 --> 21:45.598
It was definitely
an accident.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.565
Dr. Magnus,

21:46.567 --> 21:48.067
there was only
one of those creatures

21:48.069 --> 21:50.202
on the plane with you,
wasn't there?

21:50.204 --> 21:52.137
And now we're surrounded
by nests of them.

21:52.139 --> 21:53.305
Now, let's not
overreact.

21:53.307 --> 21:55.040
They're all still frozen.

21:55.042 --> 21:56.942
We pack this one
back on ice,

21:56.944 --> 21:58.510
and we're in business.

21:58.512 --> 22:00.479
I noticed something weird
about the ice...

22:00.481 --> 22:01.380
It's fresh water.

22:01.382 --> 22:02.581
The entire block.

22:02.583 --> 22:03.983
Not a trace of salt.

22:03.985 --> 22:06.085
Does it have something
to do with their metabolism?

22:06.087 --> 22:07.186
Exposure
to salt water

22:07.188 --> 22:09.956
hyperaccelerates
their system.

22:09.958 --> 22:12.225
It makes them
too powerful to handle.

22:12.227 --> 22:13.927
It supercharges them?

22:13.929 --> 22:15.529
Great! That-that's great.

22:15.531 --> 22:17.031
Every inch

22:17.033 --> 22:19.901
of ice around here
has salt in it.

22:24.407 --> 22:26.541
Oh, come on!

22:31.546 --> 22:33.080
The boiler explosion

22:33.082 --> 22:35.048
must have breached
the damaged hulls.

22:35.050 --> 22:36.983
This room will fill
in less than an hour.

22:36.985 --> 22:39.118
The passageway,
half an hour after that.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.954
The stern hold's
filling, too.

22:40.956 --> 22:42.422
Can't we leave?

22:42.424 --> 22:44.524
Do a proper salvage
with more people?

22:44.526 --> 22:45.891
Even if we made it
through the storm,

22:45.893 --> 22:47.193
we'd be leaving
a time bomb behind.

22:49.564 --> 22:51.631
If those nests even
touch the salt water,

22:51.633 --> 22:53.467
this ship will become
a breeding ground

22:53.469 --> 22:55.302
for a Migoi army.

22:55.304 --> 22:58.205
We can't go anywhere.

23:06.497 --> 23:08.331
Henry,
whatever tools you have.

23:08.333 --> 23:09.733
Will, rope,

23:09.735 --> 23:11.334
and something to skid
the blocks on.

23:11.336 --> 23:14.037
Terry and I will move
our partially thawed friend.

23:14.039 --> 23:16.106
Oh, Doc...

23:18.208 --> 23:19.942
Guns!

23:19.944 --> 23:21.444
It was frozen, right?

23:21.446 --> 23:23.480
There's no way it could
have thawed far enough

23:23.482 --> 23:24.481
to get out on its own.

23:24.483 --> 23:26.483
Does that mean
there's more than one?

23:26.485 --> 23:28.118
That's it's way of
getting into our heads.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.719
It could be making us
think it's free,

23:29.721 --> 23:30.854
when it's still
thawing

23:30.856 --> 23:33.790
there on the table.

23:38.129 --> 23:39.496
You guys seeing
what I'm seeing?

23:39.498 --> 23:42.298
Henry, radio
Declan and Alistair

23:42.300 --> 23:44.166
and have them
rejoin us immediately.

23:44.168 --> 23:45.768
Tell them not to
lose sight of each other

23:45.770 --> 23:48.137
on the way up.

23:48.139 --> 23:49.204
This doesn't
change our plan.

23:49.206 --> 23:52.107
It just makes it
more dangerous.

23:52.109 --> 23:53.275
It's important
we keep eyes open

23:53.277 --> 23:55.877
and on each other at all times.

23:55.879 --> 23:57.245
When you're alone,

23:57.247 --> 23:58.679
you can't trust anything
you see, hear, or feel.

23:58.681 --> 24:00.414
The less we use our eyes,
the more we see.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.850
They're on their way.

24:03.852 --> 24:05.185
Doc, they weren't together
when I called.

24:05.187 --> 24:06.753
Declan was in the hold,

24:06.755 --> 24:09.022
Alistair was on his way
with the first ice block.

24:09.024 --> 24:10.023
Damn.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.863
Whoa...

24:15.865 --> 24:17.965
Easy, it's me.

24:17.967 --> 24:19.400
It's me.

24:19.402 --> 24:22.203
M-me too.

24:22.205 --> 24:24.406
It's impossible to tell
who's real and who's not.

24:24.408 --> 24:26.040
It's like the blood test
on the plane.

24:26.042 --> 24:28.210
They can make us see
whatever they want.

24:28.212 --> 24:29.478
We've learned
a few things

24:29.480 --> 24:31.013
since our initial encounter
on the mountain.

24:31.015 --> 24:34.150
The Migoi react very badly
when they feel threatened.

24:34.152 --> 24:36.252
That's when they try
to defend themselves.

24:36.254 --> 24:37.486
And by "badly,"

24:37.488 --> 24:39.521
you mean by making us
try to kill each other.

24:41.224 --> 24:43.959
So we don't threaten them,
and they leave us alone?

24:43.961 --> 24:46.495
That's hard to do
in close quarters.

24:46.497 --> 24:47.730
Well, until
this storm subsides

24:47.732 --> 24:49.965
or we're completely
overwhelmed with water,

24:49.967 --> 24:51.166
we need to keep moving
the Migoi

24:51.168 --> 24:52.834
up onto the deck.

24:52.836 --> 24:54.102
I'll take Declan down
to the stern hold.

24:54.104 --> 24:55.504
Will, Alistair,

24:55.506 --> 24:57.139
you take the keel.

24:57.141 --> 24:58.340
Henry, Terry,

24:58.342 --> 25:00.876
move the blocks of ice
as we cut them topside.

25:00.878 --> 25:02.044
Remember,

25:02.046 --> 25:03.312
it's the little things
that will give them away.

25:22.567 --> 25:24.201
How do you think
these Migoi got here?

25:24.203 --> 25:25.369
I don't know.

25:25.371 --> 25:26.603
The Russians must have
either bought them

25:26.605 --> 25:28.204
or captured them.

25:28.206 --> 25:30.206
No, I mean in here,
frozen, like.

25:30.208 --> 25:32.575
These ice blocks
look really uniform.

25:35.146 --> 25:36.379
Aw, cripes, it's cold.

25:36.381 --> 25:38.482
I can't imagine it's
a trick of their physiology

25:38.484 --> 25:41.452
to be able to flash freeze
themselves into ice cubes,

25:41.454 --> 25:44.155
and with fresh water, no less.

25:44.157 --> 25:45.857
The smugglers must have
put them on ice somewhere else,

25:45.859 --> 25:47.192
and this is how
they were transporting them.

25:47.194 --> 25:49.161
It seems a safe way
to move something

25:49.163 --> 25:50.295
that can get inside your mind.

25:50.297 --> 25:53.066
Yeah, but then
who killed everyone on board?

25:53.068 --> 25:56.002
If the crew
killed each other,

25:56.004 --> 25:58.204
maybe one of them got free?

25:58.206 --> 25:59.472
No, I think we should
get out of here--

25:59.474 --> 26:02.608
Alistair, we're going to
be fine, okay?

26:09.618 --> 26:11.919
Maybe we should have
a plan B!

26:11.921 --> 26:13.921
The Migoi
are extremely rare.

26:13.923 --> 26:16.257
This could be
the last of their kind.

26:16.259 --> 26:18.159
<i>Magnus! Oh, my God...</i>

26:18.161 --> 26:19.560
<i>We're up on--</i>

26:19.562 --> 26:20.627
<i>it's Terry!</i>

26:20.629 --> 26:21.628
Henry!

26:22.931 --> 26:24.965
Terry, Alistair!

26:29.436 --> 26:31.003
You killed her,
you bastard!

26:31.005 --> 26:32.004
How could you
do that?

26:32.006 --> 26:33.472
My God, how could you do it?

26:33.474 --> 26:36.575
Put the guns down!
Both of you!

26:36.577 --> 26:38.110
He killed her!
I saw him do it!

26:38.112 --> 26:39.912
I was at the stairs!

26:39.914 --> 26:41.346
I turned around
and he was changing back!

26:41.348 --> 26:42.547
He tore her apart, Doc!

26:42.549 --> 26:44.616
Put your guns down, now!

26:44.618 --> 26:45.917
Put them down, both of you!

26:45.919 --> 26:47.419
You were coming
up on deck.

26:47.421 --> 26:49.421
She said she'd figured
something out.

26:49.423 --> 26:51.390
You were just going
over there to talk!

26:51.392 --> 26:52.958
You're a bloody liar!

26:52.960 --> 26:54.426
I came up here,

26:54.428 --> 26:55.962
and she was already
down in the snow!

26:55.964 --> 26:57.196
You turned into the beast
and killed her!

26:57.198 --> 26:58.598
No!

27:00.368 --> 27:01.601
Get them inside now!

27:03.438 --> 27:04.437
Son of a--

27:04.439 --> 27:05.439
calm down!

27:05.441 --> 27:06.273
Terry...

27:09.344 --> 27:11.179
Just get inside.

27:20.157 --> 27:22.490
She was definitely
killed by a HAP.

27:22.492 --> 27:24.391
It could be
either one of them.

27:25.561 --> 27:26.594
Let me out!

27:26.596 --> 27:27.627
You're putting them
in the same room?

27:27.629 --> 27:29.696
What would you have me do?

27:29.698 --> 27:31.598
It's true one of them
could be a Migoi,

27:31.600 --> 27:33.600
or they could just be
under the influence of one.

27:33.602 --> 27:36.336
Remember the Migoi's
tactic on the plane

27:36.338 --> 27:38.138
was to separate us.

27:38.140 --> 27:40.040
They're not strong enough
to attack two people at once.

27:40.042 --> 27:41.375
Henry can
take care of himself.

27:41.377 --> 27:42.643
So can Alistair.

27:44.013 --> 27:46.413
Magnus! Let me
out of this room right now!

27:46.415 --> 27:48.382
We're running out of time.

27:55.291 --> 27:56.658
Why?

28:26.655 --> 28:27.589
No, no, no!

28:27.591 --> 28:29.423
Magnus!

28:29.425 --> 28:31.325
Alistair!

28:31.327 --> 28:33.461
Henry!

29:05.090 --> 29:07.291
I tried talking to him,

29:07.293 --> 29:09.193
asked him how he could
just kill her like that.

29:09.195 --> 29:11.129
He didn't answer.

29:11.131 --> 29:12.364
Henry...

29:12.366 --> 29:14.432
He had me, Doc,
he had me by the throat.

29:14.434 --> 29:15.834
I couldn't breathe.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.972
I just started slashing away
at anything I could,

29:19.974 --> 29:21.240
and then it was over.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.845
No Alistair,
no HAP.

29:24.847 --> 29:27.214
Just this little guy
bleeding on the ground.

29:27.216 --> 29:29.416
But he hasn't got
a scratch on him.

29:31.318 --> 29:35.087
Well, that's because
none of it was real.

29:35.089 --> 29:38.089
It had you killing
yourself, Henry.

29:38.091 --> 29:39.691
It was so real.

29:41.193 --> 29:44.195
We found Alistair's body
in the keel.

29:47.901 --> 29:49.434
We have less than
30 minutes

29:49.436 --> 29:51.036
until that water

29:51.038 --> 29:52.071
reaches the lowest
of the ice blocks

29:52.073 --> 29:53.306
in the keel hold.

29:53.308 --> 29:54.974
There are seven more to move.

29:54.976 --> 29:56.442
Right.
We'll get them topside

29:56.444 --> 29:58.946
away from the immediate
threat of the salt water.

29:58.948 --> 30:02.049
We'll move them to the plane
before the ship goes down.

30:02.051 --> 30:04.251
And what about our dead?

30:04.253 --> 30:06.087
I've lost three of my team
here today, Magnus.

30:06.089 --> 30:07.488
There will be time to grieve

30:07.490 --> 30:09.390
once the threat
has been minimized.

30:10.959 --> 30:12.126
I'd like to see Alistair.

30:21.068 --> 30:22.335
They were going to
get married, you know?

30:22.337 --> 30:24.303
He spent
his whole life

30:24.305 --> 30:25.471
locked up
in an institution,

30:25.473 --> 30:27.406
he finally...

30:27.408 --> 30:29.841
Gets out to see what
the world has to offer.

30:29.843 --> 30:33.345
Aw, man...

30:33.347 --> 30:35.013
You think
it's your fault

30:35.015 --> 30:36.815
that Alistair died?

30:36.817 --> 30:39.350
Because you told him to join
the London Sanctuary?

30:39.352 --> 30:42.787
I did it
because I was selfish, Will.

30:42.789 --> 30:44.289
I just wanted somebody
with my skill set

30:44.291 --> 30:45.490
on the other end of the line.

30:45.492 --> 30:47.459
Come on...

30:49.095 --> 30:50.229
My radio--

30:50.231 --> 30:53.299
no, don't. Stay dry.

30:53.301 --> 30:56.235
There's no reason for both of us
to freeze to death in here.

30:57.538 --> 30:59.138
Without you,

30:59.140 --> 31:01.074
Alistair would have been
stuck in that institution

31:01.076 --> 31:02.509
for his entire life.

31:02.511 --> 31:04.144
You showed him that
turning into a wolf

31:04.146 --> 31:05.112
and howling
at the moon

31:05.114 --> 31:06.880
was the coolest
thing ever.

31:06.882 --> 31:09.216
Yeah, you know
we don't do that, Will.

31:09.218 --> 31:11.318
You gave him
a gift.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.452
You gave him the ability

31:12.454 --> 31:14.021
to live a life
of his own choosing,

31:14.023 --> 31:15.989
and he chose to join
that Sanctuary.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.058
If I have a boy,

31:19.060 --> 31:22.128
I'm going to name him
Alistair, Will.

31:22.130 --> 31:27.466
William Alistair Henry Foss,
son of two HAPs.

31:27.468 --> 31:29.302
Nobody will ever
make fun of him for that.

31:41.016 --> 31:42.850
Well, that's our lot.

31:42.852 --> 31:44.418
I'll go and help
Will and Henry.

31:44.420 --> 31:45.686
I'll see what I can do

31:45.688 --> 31:47.955
about preparing Terry's
body for transport.

31:47.957 --> 31:49.289
Thanks, Magnus.

31:49.291 --> 31:50.524
Let's get this done!

32:08.140 --> 32:10.241
What were you doing
back there, mate?

32:19.150 --> 32:21.518
Bloody hell.

32:25.256 --> 32:26.957
Seriously?

32:26.959 --> 32:28.459
It appears
we have

32:28.461 --> 32:29.460
another thawed
Migoi on our hands.

32:29.462 --> 32:31.562
This is larger
than a single block.

32:31.564 --> 32:33.297
Maybe it's
more than one.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.532
Or one very big one.

32:36.067 --> 32:37.334
Do you still think

32:37.336 --> 32:38.502
Murray was killed
by accident?

32:38.504 --> 32:40.003
I don't know
what I think anymore.

32:40.005 --> 32:41.572
I mean, I know what I saw,

32:41.574 --> 32:43.540
but that doesn't seem to matter
with the Migoi, so--

32:46.310 --> 32:47.944
This ship isn't going
to stay afloat much longer.

32:47.946 --> 32:49.246
How many more are still to move?

32:49.248 --> 32:50.547
Four.

32:50.549 --> 32:51.749
They're off the wall.

32:51.751 --> 32:53.184
They just have to be
moved to the deck.

32:53.186 --> 32:55.220
All right, Declan,
you go with Henry,

32:55.222 --> 32:56.387
move them up
as quickly as you can.

32:56.389 --> 32:58.890
Once they're clear,
move Alistair's body.

32:58.892 --> 33:00.626
Will and I will
take Murray up right now

33:00.628 --> 33:03.028
and start moving the Migoi
off the ship.

33:03.030 --> 33:04.997
Aren't we better
staying together--

33:04.999 --> 33:07.099
our best bet is to move
the remaining ice blocks first.

33:07.101 --> 33:08.901
Once they're clear
of the salt water,

33:08.903 --> 33:10.135
we can deal with
our friend here.

33:10.137 --> 33:12.304
We won't leave
until we track him down.

33:12.306 --> 33:14.072
I don't fancy
getting on another plane

33:14.074 --> 33:15.207
with a loose Migoi.

33:15.209 --> 33:16.908
Seconded.

33:16.910 --> 33:18.910
No one loses sight
of their partner.

33:18.912 --> 33:21.479
If you are approached
by any one of us individually,

33:21.481 --> 33:22.581
shoot to kill

33:22.583 --> 33:24.049
without engaging.

33:25.585 --> 33:27.619
I'm tired of losing our people.

33:39.202 --> 33:41.002
I'm frozen,

33:41.004 --> 33:43.071
on a sinking ship
full of dead people,

33:43.073 --> 33:44.506
taking the body
of my friend

33:44.508 --> 33:46.174
out into a snowstorm,

33:46.176 --> 33:48.342
and I don't know if the guy
standing next to me

33:48.344 --> 33:51.211
wants to kill me or not!

33:51.213 --> 33:53.380
No offense, mate,

33:53.382 --> 33:55.149
but I'm in exactly
the same position,

33:55.151 --> 33:56.450
except the guy
standing next to me

33:56.452 --> 33:57.650
that might want to kill me

33:57.652 --> 33:58.952
is a werewolf!

33:58.954 --> 34:00.286
What?
How can you say that?

34:00.288 --> 34:01.588
I just killed one of them!

34:01.590 --> 34:04.157
I'm standing
up to my chest

34:04.159 --> 34:05.591
in salt water!

34:05.593 --> 34:06.425
What is your point?

34:06.427 --> 34:08.161
Well, I'm just saying

34:08.163 --> 34:10.496
there doesn't seem to be
anything supercharged

34:10.498 --> 34:12.498
about either one of us.

34:12.501 --> 34:14.034
Okay, so it's
neither of us, then.

34:16.638 --> 34:17.538
Will!

34:17.540 --> 34:19.474
Will!

34:19.476 --> 34:20.408
Will!

34:26.463 --> 34:27.596
Magnus!

34:27.598 --> 34:29.130
Will just locked us
in the hold!

34:29.132 --> 34:30.866
She was with him.

34:30.868 --> 34:32.101
Magnus!

34:32.103 --> 34:34.503
Do you think
he got her already?

34:35.739 --> 34:37.672
I don't get it!

34:37.674 --> 34:39.641
If we're the last ones left,
why not just kill us?

34:39.643 --> 34:41.576
You don't think
this is going to kill us?

34:41.578 --> 34:43.178
If we don't
freeze to death,

34:43.179 --> 34:44.179
we're going to be
underwater

34:44.181 --> 34:45.580
in about 15 minutes.

34:45.581 --> 34:47.482
Well, can't you just...

34:47.484 --> 34:48.449
HAP?

34:48.451 --> 34:49.550
Through a steel door?

34:49.552 --> 34:51.652
I'm a werewolf, not Superman.

34:51.655 --> 34:53.688
We need stunners
to blast through that.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.590
Which are in the hallway
with our warm, dry clothes.

34:57.559 --> 34:58.659
Wait a second.

35:00.162 --> 35:02.163
What do you see
when you look at my hand?

35:02.165 --> 35:04.398
I see your hand on the wheel
that we can't turn.

35:05.768 --> 35:06.735
So what's that?

35:09.171 --> 35:10.338
Uh...

35:12.874 --> 35:15.409
I blew this door open
when I came in here.

35:19.547 --> 35:21.081
It's insane!

35:21.083 --> 35:25.519
They trick you into dying
in a room you can walk out of.

35:25.521 --> 35:27.153
It's insanely scary.

35:32.393 --> 35:33.560
Magnus!

35:33.562 --> 35:35.295
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Doc, it's us!

35:36.731 --> 35:38.632
How do we know it's her?

35:38.634 --> 35:39.632
I've been trying
to raise you

35:39.634 --> 35:40.900
on the radio.

35:40.902 --> 35:41.768
Will's missing!

35:42.937 --> 35:43.870
He found us,

35:43.872 --> 35:45.172
and he locked us
in the hold!

35:45.174 --> 35:46.507
It's not him, Magnus!

35:46.509 --> 35:48.242
He pulled a Jedi
mind-trick on us, Doc.

35:48.244 --> 35:50.545
He made us think
the door was locked

35:50.547 --> 35:51.880
and left us to die in the water.

35:51.882 --> 35:53.848
We should never have split up.

35:53.850 --> 35:55.483
We need to find the real Will.

35:55.485 --> 35:57.218
And the Migoi.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.353
It's too dangerous
left on its own.

35:59.355 --> 36:02.389
Bad Will hunting.
I'm in.

36:03.591 --> 36:05.459
Declan, what is it?

36:05.461 --> 36:06.726
Nothing.

36:06.728 --> 36:08.595
I thought I saw something.

36:08.597 --> 36:11.297
Yeah, that's
going around.

36:15.770 --> 36:18.639
There isn't much time.
Trust nothing.

36:18.641 --> 36:21.409
The game will be
to try to split us up.

36:21.411 --> 36:22.710
<i>Magnus? Henry?</i>

36:22.712 --> 36:24.278
<i>Anyone?</i>

36:25.714 --> 36:27.782
Will, where are you?

36:27.784 --> 36:29.284
<i>I'm in the stern hold.</i>

36:29.286 --> 36:30.418
<i>Someone knocked me out</i>
<i>and dragged me in here.</i>

36:30.420 --> 36:31.620
<i>You guys have got to</i>
<i>get me out.</i>

36:31.622 --> 36:32.787
<i>It's filling up really fast.</i>

36:32.789 --> 36:34.823
We're on our way.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.391
Wait.

36:36.393 --> 36:37.625
Will doesn't have a radio.

36:37.627 --> 36:40.562
He dropped it in the water
about 20 minutes ago.

36:40.564 --> 36:43.932
Well, we've found at
least one of our Wills.

36:45.701 --> 36:48.903
They say you locked them
in the keel hold, Will!

36:48.905 --> 36:49.804
How could I?

36:49.806 --> 36:51.371
I was out cold!

36:51.373 --> 36:52.439
Seriously cold!

36:52.441 --> 36:54.341
Come on, Magnus,
get me out of here!

36:54.343 --> 36:56.610
We tried radioing you,
you didn't answer.

36:56.612 --> 36:59.380
I dropped mine earlier
when I was with Henry,

36:59.382 --> 37:00.448
and I found one!

37:00.450 --> 37:02.784
It must have
belonged to Alistair!

37:02.786 --> 37:03.818
Sounds possible.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.019
Come on, you guys.

37:05.021 --> 37:07.389
This whole room
is filling up with water!

37:07.391 --> 37:08.390
If I were a Migoi,

37:08.392 --> 37:09.758
don't you think
I would just jump in,

37:09.760 --> 37:10.692
supercharge,

37:10.694 --> 37:11.893
and just knock
this door down?

37:11.895 --> 37:13.829
That's a good point.

37:13.831 --> 37:15.664
All right,
we need to be sure.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.599
Look for inconsistencies.

37:17.601 --> 37:19.000
Right.

37:19.002 --> 37:20.835
Will, step away
from the door.

37:24.473 --> 37:25.607
Thank you!

37:25.609 --> 37:27.376
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on.

37:27.378 --> 37:29.878
Come on, I'm me.
I'm really me!

37:29.880 --> 37:31.814
Feel! You can't fake
this kind of cold!

37:44.102 --> 37:45.602
Stay right
where you are!

37:45.604 --> 37:46.970
What on earth...?

37:46.972 --> 37:48.739
Put your guns down
and don't come any closer!

37:48.741 --> 37:50.707
Henry?

37:52.476 --> 37:54.877
What the hell?

37:56.713 --> 37:59.581
We're not here to hurt you.

37:59.583 --> 38:00.549
You killed
three of our team!

38:00.551 --> 38:02.651
We just got here.

38:02.653 --> 38:04.553
We know you're just here
to save your kind!

38:04.555 --> 38:06.455
Who are you, really?

38:06.457 --> 38:08.624
We mean you no harm.

38:08.626 --> 38:10.492
We just need to move you
off this ship.

38:10.494 --> 38:12.728
Magnus?

38:12.730 --> 38:13.995
It's actually

38:13.997 --> 38:15.597
a very clever trick.

38:15.599 --> 38:17.099
With the four of us together,

38:17.101 --> 38:18.901
they aren't strong enough
to manipulate us.

38:18.903 --> 38:20.803
So they turn us
against one another.

38:21.939 --> 38:23.973
You have us
at a disadvantage.

38:23.975 --> 38:25.241
You must have known

38:25.243 --> 38:26.842
we would figure out what
you were doing eventually.

38:26.844 --> 38:28.077
This is crazy.

38:28.079 --> 38:30.179
We just landed
10 minutes ago.

38:30.181 --> 38:31.948
Magnus, why do they
look like us?

38:31.950 --> 38:33.683
Interesting timing.

38:33.685 --> 38:35.751
We've spent hours
getting those blocks

38:35.753 --> 38:36.651
away from the water,

38:36.653 --> 38:37.752
and when we're finally finished,

38:37.754 --> 38:39.187
you guys show up
down here.

38:39.189 --> 38:41.523
You've been
together for hours?

38:41.525 --> 38:42.657
Declan,
how did you lose

38:42.659 --> 38:43.891
your team?

38:43.893 --> 38:46.661
You two killed them,
apparently.

38:46.663 --> 38:48.329
If we've only just got here,

38:48.331 --> 38:49.997
it had to have been someone

38:49.999 --> 38:51.699
who's been here
all along.

38:51.701 --> 38:52.933
Someone who could
take on the aspect

38:52.935 --> 38:53.934
of anyone on board this ship,

38:53.936 --> 38:54.969
including Will and me.

38:54.971 --> 38:57.237
Someone who was dependent

38:57.239 --> 38:58.538
on the four of us
being separated

38:58.540 --> 39:00.773
so that they could assume
an identity.

39:00.775 --> 39:02.709
Shape shifters?
Chameleons?

39:02.711 --> 39:04.277
Look, we know
you're Migoi!

39:05.646 --> 39:06.880
Dear God, here?

39:06.882 --> 39:08.582
You gotta be kidding me.

39:08.584 --> 39:10.651
The smugglers had Migoi
on board?

39:12.054 --> 39:13.154
No wonder
the ship ran aground.

39:13.156 --> 39:16.258
They would have wiped out
the entire crew.

39:16.260 --> 39:18.293
How can we argue with you?
You can read our minds!

39:18.295 --> 39:20.629
That's not
necessarily true.

39:20.631 --> 39:22.564
Migoi can tap
into our psyche,

39:22.566 --> 39:23.832
but they can't read
our every thought.

39:26.135 --> 39:29.137
I think I'm beginning
to understand.

39:29.139 --> 39:31.139
This ship is sinking.

39:31.141 --> 39:32.640
You needed my people

39:32.642 --> 39:34.175
to move the rest of
your kind onto the ice

39:34.177 --> 39:36.110
because you couldn't
do it yourselves.

39:37.212 --> 39:38.211
We moved them

39:38.213 --> 39:39.246
so they would be safe
for transport.

39:39.248 --> 39:40.681
We were trying to help.

39:40.683 --> 39:42.783
You moved them away from
the encroaching water.

39:42.785 --> 39:44.852
Come any closer,
and we will shoot you.

39:44.854 --> 39:46.187
Go ahead.

39:46.189 --> 39:47.655
They can, but you can't.

39:47.657 --> 39:50.992
You only exist here
as a Migoi,

39:50.994 --> 39:52.661
which means you aren't really
holding a gun.

39:53.930 --> 39:55.197
The first person
to fire a shot

39:55.199 --> 39:57.867
will be shot by everyone else
in this room.

39:57.869 --> 39:59.568
Are you willing to risk it?

39:59.570 --> 40:00.670
Doc?

40:00.672 --> 40:03.774
The solution is
very simple, Henry.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.909
You and Declan have already
been in the water.

40:05.911 --> 40:07.644
These two
clearly haven't.

40:07.646 --> 40:09.011
What's that
got to do with anything?

40:09.013 --> 40:11.280
She's going to propose

40:11.282 --> 40:12.548
that two of us
get into the water

40:12.550 --> 40:13.716
to see which one
turns into a Migoi.

40:13.718 --> 40:14.952
Exactly.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.887
Not a chance!

40:16.889 --> 40:18.188
No one goes in the water!

40:18.190 --> 40:21.024
The last thing we need
is a supercharged Migoi!

40:21.026 --> 40:22.259
Is that what
she told you happens?

40:41.681 --> 40:42.781
Salt water kills them?

40:42.783 --> 40:43.849
Apparently
very well.

40:47.254 --> 40:49.655
Bloody hell!

40:49.657 --> 40:52.056
Am I always that stubborn?

41:16.313 --> 41:17.914
Doc...

41:17.916 --> 41:20.149
How could they mimic you
so perfectly?

41:20.151 --> 41:21.984
I've known you my whole life.

41:21.986 --> 41:23.085
I couldn't see any difference.

41:23.087 --> 41:25.087
It's because you
know me so well, Henry,

41:25.089 --> 41:25.988
that they could do it.

41:27.423 --> 41:29.190
They constructed the
two of us from your mind

41:29.192 --> 41:30.358
and Declan's.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.760
They reacted
exactly the way

41:31.762 --> 41:34.128
you would expect us
to react.

41:34.130 --> 41:36.430
Speech patterns, movements,
even emotions.

41:36.432 --> 41:38.932
Terry, Murray, and Alistair
didn't stand a chance.

41:38.934 --> 41:39.799
It would have been
the littlest things

41:39.801 --> 41:42.335
that would give them away.

41:44.104 --> 41:45.372
They probably never
opened a frozen door

41:45.374 --> 41:47.474
or pushed a block of ice.

41:47.476 --> 41:49.743
They needed us to do that.

41:49.745 --> 41:50.611
Exactly.

41:50.613 --> 41:52.480
The Migoi are all
strapped in.

41:52.482 --> 41:53.781
Are you sure
you want to do this?

41:53.783 --> 41:56.451
Doc, they killed
three of our people.

41:56.453 --> 41:58.354
They did what any creature
who feels threatened

41:58.356 --> 41:59.555
would do.

41:59.557 --> 42:00.857
They found a way to survive,
and they took it.

42:00.859 --> 42:02.892
The Migoi in those
ice blocks

42:02.894 --> 42:04.394
have done
nothing wrong.

42:04.396 --> 42:06.229
They deserve
our protection.

42:06.231 --> 42:08.965
We'll take them back
to the Sanctuary,

42:08.967 --> 42:11.435
and we'll honor
our fallen friends by doing so.

42:15.006 --> 42:17.341
It's time to go.

42:17.343 --> 42:18.875
Let's get you home.

42:21.379 --> 42:23.380
You open it.
