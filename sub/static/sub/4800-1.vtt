01:44.960 --> 01:48.080
Your brother's soul is mine.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.360
Liu!

01:50.360 --> 01:53.000
You will be next.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.120
Chan.

02:23.480 --> 02:27.120
"Liu Kang - Brother Dead.
Return home. Grandfather"

02:35.560 --> 02:36.560
Let's go.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.520
ls the perimeter secured?

02:39.520 --> 02:42.120
- Yes!
- Better be, l want Kano.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.240
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person. You talk to her.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.600
Good boy.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.000
She's here.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.640
Right on time.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.800
l love punctuality in a woman...

03:18.800 --> 03:20.600
don't you...

03:20.600 --> 03:22.400
Mr. Shang Tsung?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.440
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?

03:29.360 --> 03:31.320
You killed her partner, didn't you?

03:32.640 --> 03:34.600
She'll follow you into hell.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.800
Just make sure she's on that boat.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.320
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.320
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.480
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.040
lf you so much as touch her, Kano...

03:55.040 --> 03:56.760
you'll need a seeing eye dog.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.400
Where's Kano?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.040
Where is he?

05:08.720 --> 05:09.800
Let's dance.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.160
This is where you fall down.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.480
Where do you get these guys?

05:50.480 --> 05:53.080
The press says l don't know
how to do this stuff?

05:53.080 --> 05:56.960
- Cut. Reset. Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.640
- What do you mean?
- l won't.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.440
- lt's the last shot! Where you going?
- To my trailer.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.360
Then l'll shoot myself for being
in your movie.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.960
Kill me.
l'll be back directing traffic.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.640
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!

06:09.640 --> 06:11.520
l love you. l need you.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.640
Excuse me,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.360
there's someone who wants
to speak to you.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.800
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.760
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. l...

06:22.760 --> 06:25.960
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.560
You want me to find out?

06:31.480 --> 06:33.000
Oh, great.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.920
Mister, you're in my chair.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.000
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"

06:39.280 --> 06:41.000
Hi, Johnny.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.880
Master Boyd.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.600
The press is still giving you
a hard time.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.440
Yeah, they think l'm a fake.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.160
You're one of the best
martial artists in the world...

06:53.160 --> 06:55.920
and l can help you prove it.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.040
Prove it? How?

06:57.040 --> 06:58.760
A tournament.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.200
The tournament.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.320
lt's held once a generation.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.760
The world's best fighters
are invited.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.240
You win the tournament,
you win their respect.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.960
They'll tell the entire world
you're the real goods.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.360
- So how do l...?
- There's a boat.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.320
Leaves pier forty...

07:18.320 --> 07:20.200
Hong Kong, tomorrow.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.960
Be on it.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.600
"The Temple of Light, China"

08:15.760 --> 08:17.120
Liu.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.240
ls this the place?

08:28.240 --> 08:29.720
Yes.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.400
This is where we found his body.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.120
What happened?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.559
After you left for America...

08:36.559 --> 08:38.720
he followed in your footsteps.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.520
Preparing for the tournament.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.560
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough
to fill my head with that nonsense?

08:44.560 --> 08:47.120
To save the world is not nonsense.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.360
Men fighting in a simple contest
don't decide these things.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.040
How can a wise man believe this?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.960
We all believe in it...

08:54.960 --> 08:56.840
including your brother.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.920
Liu Kang has been given the dream.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.800
He is the Chosen One.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.480
No. He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.280
Why have you come back?

09:24.280 --> 09:27.680
l want to represent the Order of Light
at the Tournament.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.320
For what reason?

09:29.320 --> 09:32.040
My brother's killer will be there.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.120
That cannot be your only reason
for going...

09:35.120 --> 09:37.320
or you will fail.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.880
Oh yes, l forgot.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.840
We're fighting for the fate
of the world.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.960
That's why you left the temple...

09:44.960 --> 09:47.720
and ran away, isn't it?

09:56.600 --> 10:00.800
The Great Tournament
was too much responsibility.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.280
But vengeance...

10:04.440 --> 10:06.520
that's so much simpler.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.440
Lord Rayden.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.200
You're still running away
from your destiny.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.120
Rayden?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.400
Grandfather, get up.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.160
This isn't your God of Thunder.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.120
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.160
American life has enfeebled his mind.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.000
Too much television.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.480
So, you're going to
win the tournament?

10:35.480 --> 10:37.880
- Yes, l am.
- Show me how.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.680
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid...

10:43.680 --> 10:45.360
of a simple beggar?

10:58.640 --> 11:00.480
lf you are Rayden...

11:01.520 --> 11:03.760
why did you let Chan die?

11:03.760 --> 11:07.160
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?

11:08.640 --> 11:10.640
l've had enough of this.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.040
l'll find my brother's killer
at the tournament.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.240
With or without your consent.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.040
He isn't ready, my Lord...

11:29.040 --> 11:31.000
and we lost so much time.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.040
l know.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.840
But there is no one else.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.880
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"

12:03.000 --> 12:04.680
Ah, give me a break.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.880
"Johnny Cage Fake!"

12:11.920 --> 12:13.480
- Sure.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.520
Aren't you Art Lean?

12:16.520 --> 12:19.480
l saw you fight in London,
you're great.

12:19.480 --> 12:24.160
Thanks. l saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.320
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.320
Pal, when the ship comes in...

12:33.320 --> 12:35.640
could you put these on board?

12:35.640 --> 12:37.640
You want me to carry your luggage?

12:37.640 --> 12:41.120
l pay money. You carry bags.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.120
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.280
l got it.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.720
Good.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.960
Thank God l didn't ask him
to park the car.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.040
Nothing says that creep at the club
wasn't lying.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.440
Kano could be 1000 miles
from here by now.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.480
What is that?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.080
You must be kidding me.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.960
Wait.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.880
That's it, Blade...

13:51.560 --> 13:53.280
come to Papa.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.800
Sonya, don't get on that thing.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.440
Hey, Sonya!

14:27.080 --> 14:28.640
Hey, you.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.880
Alright, tough guy, you want to get...

14:31.880 --> 14:33.000
tough?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.560
No. Do you?

14:34.560 --> 14:37.920
l'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.840
Where's Kano?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.720
l don't know who you're talking about.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.480
But l can help you find him.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.400
Out of my way.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.960
Just another starstruck fan, huh?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.560
l'm honored to finally meet you.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.880
Shang Tsung at your service.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.360
l'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.880
l'm impressed.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.000
But it is my boat,
and if you'd like a tour...

15:30.000 --> 15:32.760
l'd love to give it to you myself.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.520
Be nice to the lady.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.280
She's doing her job.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.320
When l want back-up
l'll radio for it.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.080
Got that radio handy?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.280
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.560
The deadliest of enemies...

15:59.560 --> 16:01.640
but slaves under my power.

16:04.040 --> 16:04.840
Move aside.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.520
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.720
How good of you to grace us
with your...

16:39.400 --> 16:40.520
presence.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.280
Your sideshow freaks
attacked my fighters.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.960
That is expressly forbidden
before the tournament...

16:48.960 --> 16:50.880
as your emperor well knows.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.360
My sincere apologies.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.440
lt won't happen again,
l promise you.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.760
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.920
Until we reach the island...

17:00.920 --> 17:02.760
where you have no dominion.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.319
My dominions are well known to me,
sorcerer.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.760
- Thank you.
- What tournament?

17:09.599 --> 17:11.599
You've been chosen, Sonya.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.599
Much to my delight.

17:21.359 --> 17:22.800
You really are Rayden.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.920
Come with me.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.600
1 guy with things coming
out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff...

17:33.600 --> 17:36.960
and 1 man who seems to be made
out of electricity.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.320
How did he disappear?
What's going on? Who is he?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.320
Let's think this through.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.440
There is a rational explanation.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.960
He's Rayden, God of Lightening
and Protector of the Realm of Earth.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.240
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.680
Listen.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.080
What you're about to face is...

17:56.080 --> 17:58.000
vastly more important than...

17:58.000 --> 18:00.240
your ego...

18:00.240 --> 18:01.880
your enemy...

18:01.880 --> 18:05.440
or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked...

18:05.440 --> 18:07.800
on a sacred mission.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.280
You have been chosen to defend
the Realm of Earth...

18:11.280 --> 18:14.160
in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.800
Defend it from who?

18:17.240 --> 18:20.440
Your world is but
one of many realms.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.960
One of them is a forsaken land
called Outworld...

18:23.960 --> 18:27.520
ruled by an immortal
who has crowned himself emperor.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.920
Now he seeks a new world
to conquer and enslave.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.800
Now, wait a second.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.120
lf this guy is so powerful...

18:35.120 --> 18:36.960
why doesn't he invade us?

18:36.960 --> 18:39.080
To enter the Realm of Earth

18:39.080 --> 18:41.720
the Emperor's demon sorcerer,
Shang Tsung...

18:41.720 --> 18:45.720
and his warriors must win 10 straight
victories in Mortal Kombat.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.560
They have won nine.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.520
This will be the tenth.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.480
A handful of people on a leaky boat
are going to save the world?

18:57.280 --> 18:58.800
Exactly.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.520
The essence of Mortal Kombat...

19:04.840 --> 19:06.840
is not about death...

19:07.600 --> 19:09.440
but life.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.560
Mortal men and women...

19:12.560 --> 19:14.440
defending your own world.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.400
Why are you telling me this?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.320
What about the others?

19:18.320 --> 19:20.560
They are all great fighters...

19:21.800 --> 19:24.440
but l have looked
into their souls...

19:25.680 --> 19:27.960
and yours.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.560
One of you will decide
the outcome of the tournament.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.640
The fate...

19:34.640 --> 19:37.200
of billions will depend upon you.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.520
Sorry.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.640
What about Shang Tsung?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.160
Oh, still concerned
only with vengeance?

19:51.160 --> 19:54.080
lf you challenge Shang Tsung now...

19:54.080 --> 19:56.360
you'll lose your life and your soul.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.520
He'll pay for my brother's death.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.000
You're not ready.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.880
Look.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.040
lt has begun.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.280
lt has begun.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.400
Black Hawk to Cardinal.

20:55.400 --> 20:59.080
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
ls anybody monitoring?

21:01.520 --> 21:04.640
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?

21:04.640 --> 21:07.800
While you're at it,
call my agent.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.040
Do l look like your secretary?

21:36.520 --> 21:37.720
What are you doing?

21:37.720 --> 21:40.880
The electrical disturbance
blew out the transistors.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.840
Your radio equipment's fine.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.760
Look at your compass.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.240
Where the hell are we?

21:53.240 --> 21:56.160
- Do l look like your travel agent?
- Fine.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.000
Okay...

21:58.000 --> 21:59.600
l give up.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.480
What's going on?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.200
l don't know.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.680
But what if all the legends
were true?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.240
What legends?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.440
Do you need help with those?

22:46.080 --> 22:47.920
Ah, no more steps.

22:52.840 --> 22:56.120
Great! Can't wait
to see the bathrooms.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.200
You know?

23:23.040 --> 23:25.160
When a woman looks at you like that...

23:25.160 --> 23:27.160
it usually means something.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.480
Princess Kitana.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.200
She's our most dangerous adversary.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.680
Watch her carefully, Reptile.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.920
Keep her away from these humans.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.400
Welcome.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.880
You're here to compete in...

25:08.880 --> 25:10.440
Mortal Kombat.

25:10.440 --> 25:14.320
Tomorrow morning the great
combat begins.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.840
Some will have the distinct honor...

25:16.840 --> 25:19.280
and pleasure...

25:19.280 --> 25:22.640
to face Prince Goro...

25:23.520 --> 25:25.080
our reigning champion.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.800
You are witnesses to a great
turning point in the history...

25:28.800 --> 25:30.720
of your planet.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.880
Treasure these moments...

25:35.640 --> 25:37.520
as if they were your last.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.560
Now, for a taste of things to come...

26:54.840 --> 26:57.520
Flawless victory.

27:04.040 --> 27:08.680
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.480
Yeah, right.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.480
Liu.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.680
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.560
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?

27:19.560 --> 27:23.280
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.920
You know, you've got to admire her.

27:26.920 --> 27:30.080
When she sets her mind on something...

27:30.080 --> 27:32.320
lt's not her mind you're admiring.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.640
True.

28:10.320 --> 28:14.120
How many times must l tell you?
l don't need your help.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.040
l can take care of myself.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.040
We can't help it.
lt's a guy thing.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.880
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.920
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.600
Let's forget about Shang.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.400
Forget about him?

28:29.400 --> 28:32.840
l want to get to the bottom of this.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.800
Are you out of your mind?

28:50.320 --> 28:51.960
Sonya...

28:51.960 --> 28:55.120
You go ahead. Find out
what that was.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.680
Liu and l'll wait right here.

28:57.680 --> 28:58.960
What?

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
See, me... l believe
in a fair fight.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.360
You know, one-on-one,
man-to-man...

29:10.360 --> 29:13.680
hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.400
But what l just saw
wasn't very fair.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.600
That's Kano.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.640
Forget about Kano.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.120
Who's the other guy?

29:22.120 --> 29:25.080
Then he freezes this guy, right?

29:25.080 --> 29:28.760
And then he explodes.
l could see his guts and everything.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.960
Almost lost my lunch.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.120
Disgusting.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.960
What l want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great...

29:39.960 --> 29:42.920
how come he's got such a
crummy looking boat?

29:44.080 --> 29:46.640
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.

29:46.640 --> 29:50.320
"Treasure these moments".

29:53.080 --> 29:56.120
That was his intention.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.320
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.560
The wise cultivate his favor.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.440
Those who challenge his power...

30:04.440 --> 30:06.640
become his slaves.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.120
Yeah?

30:09.120 --> 30:11.200
l haven't seen any of them around.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.240
You fool!

30:13.240 --> 30:15.840
You know nothing.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.560
He enslaves souls.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.920
He learned the black arts
from the Emperor himself.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.160
You're some kind of royalty too...

30:26.160 --> 30:28.600
- right?
- l am Goro!

30:28.600 --> 30:31.480
general of the armies
of Outworld and prince...

30:31.480 --> 30:34.680
of the subterranean realm of Shokan.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.680
Subterranean?

30:36.680 --> 30:39.280
What's that,
something like underground?

30:39.280 --> 30:41.680
Yes, something like...

30:41.680 --> 30:42.640
that.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.480
l'm kind of an underworld boss.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.920
Well... l mean, back home.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.640
How lucky for them...

30:51.640 --> 30:53.560
"back home".

30:55.280 --> 30:56.760
lt's true...

30:57.400 --> 30:58.800
Prince Goro.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.960
Why else would l have chosen
such a disreputable looking cretin?

31:05.760 --> 31:06.800
Look at him.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.320
No dignity...

31:09.320 --> 31:10.840
no manners.

31:10.840 --> 31:14.680
Yet in the realm of Earth...

31:14.680 --> 31:17.240
such men can amass great wealth...

31:17.240 --> 31:19.560
and almost godlike power.

31:23.200 --> 31:27.720
l'd get back to my amassing
as soon as possible, if you don't mind.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.760
Now, when do l get paid?

31:29.760 --> 31:33.160
After you've fought the girl.
But remember...

31:33.160 --> 31:36.200
she's not to be harmed,
only humiliated.

31:37.480 --> 31:40.040
l have plans for my beautiful Sonya.

31:42.760 --> 31:47.040
To what do we owe the honor
of your visit, Shang Tsung?

31:47.040 --> 31:51.560
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant
is competing in the tournament.

31:51.560 --> 31:55.920
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.640
He'll pose no problem.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.360
This is no time for
foolish pride.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.880
We've never been
so close to victory.

32:04.880 --> 32:08.080
Which is why l've come
to warn you of another danger.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.240
Princess Kitana.

32:12.240 --> 32:15.080
The Emperor's adopted daughter?

32:15.080 --> 32:17.240
Why should l worry about her?

32:17.240 --> 32:20.360
Princess Kitana
is 10,000 years old...

32:20.360 --> 32:23.000
and the rightful heir to the
throne of Outworld.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.440
She must not join the forces
from the Realm of Earth...

32:26.440 --> 32:28.840
especially Liu Kang.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.280
What's so special about you?

32:33.280 --> 32:34.480
l don't know.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.880
The Emperor will not
tolerate failure...

32:38.280 --> 32:41.040
and neither will l.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.960
l do not fail.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.880
Let's get out of here.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.720
What? What is it?

32:51.720 --> 32:54.720
We are not alone.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.960
Wait a second,
l don't remember this.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
Look!

33:13.520 --> 33:15.640
That has to be Princess Kitana.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.920
She's trying to help us.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.200
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.440
Forget her. She's 10,000 years old.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.480
- So what?
- Liu?

34:10.960 --> 34:13.560
- What happened?
- There's something here.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.639
lt's following Princess Kitana.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.760
Where is she?

34:17.760 --> 34:18.920
l don't know.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.760
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.679
Kitana went this way.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.040
l can smell her perfume.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.360
l don't smell anything.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.920
l smell something.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.280
Bullshit.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.480
We got company.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.520
Just the way l like them.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.680
Dumb and ugly.

36:02.680 --> 36:05.480
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?

36:05.480 --> 36:08.520
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.

36:08.520 --> 36:11.240
What is it with you guys?

36:11.240 --> 36:14.000
We're standing...
they're not.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.920
What more do you want?

36:23.280 --> 36:26.920
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.400
So, why don't you show me
what you plan to do about...

36:32.400 --> 36:33.480
them?

36:46.120 --> 36:48.000
l don't think so.

37:01.080 --> 37:04.040
You'll find that this
is the way out.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.440
You guys are lucky he stopped us.

37:26.200 --> 37:29.800
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?

37:29.800 --> 37:32.720
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?

37:32.720 --> 37:34.600
lf he chooses to.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.160
As a former champion
he has the right to do so.

37:37.160 --> 37:41.120
And he's far more dangerous
than Goro.

37:41.120 --> 37:45.080
His power comes from the souls
of vanquished warriors.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.040
To fight Shang Tsung...

37:47.040 --> 37:49.040
is to face not one...

37:49.040 --> 37:51.240
but a legion of adversaries.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.880
Remember that.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.880
Tomorrow the tournament begins.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.320
Be prepared.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.360
From this moment on...

38:18.360 --> 38:21.560
my island will be your battleground.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.280
Liu Kang!

38:25.280 --> 38:27.480
You will be first.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.000
Let Mortal Kombat begin.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.080
- Let's go!
- Yes!

40:32.320 --> 40:35.280
Your soul is mine.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.880
Fatality.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.120
Sonya Blade!

41:15.320 --> 41:17.280
l have something for you, my dear.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.080
l don't want anything from you.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.400
On the contrary.

41:22.400 --> 41:26.040
l have something you want very much.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.120
You can thank me later.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.520
Hello, baby.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.400
Did you miss me?

42:06.800 --> 42:08.760
Now look at this.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.480
This little baby
brings back memories, doesn't it?

42:11.480 --> 42:14.040
You used it to knife your mother
in the back?

42:15.840 --> 42:19.040
lt put a big smile on your
partner, though. Ear...

42:21.200 --> 42:22.720
to ear...

42:27.360 --> 42:29.760
Give it up. l've studied
all your moves.

42:29.760 --> 42:30.840
Study this.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.720
Does it hurt, baby?

43:29.600 --> 43:31.240
Right. Finish him.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.360
No, Sonya. Don't!

43:35.600 --> 43:37.840
- Give me a break!
- Okay.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.760
Get over here!

44:37.000 --> 44:38.400
Come here!

45:41.720 --> 45:42.920
Welcome!

47:27.080 --> 47:28.600
Get down here!

48:47.680 --> 48:51.000
"To my Greatest Fan
Johnny Cage"

49:39.720 --> 49:41.080
Begin!

49:50.120 --> 49:53.160
Fight with all of your heart
or there is no hope.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.920
Why do you care if l win?

50:09.360 --> 50:13.200
To win your next match,
use the element which brings life.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.280
What?

50:14.280 --> 50:15.360
Kitana!

50:26.440 --> 50:28.600
Remember my words.

50:28.600 --> 50:30.640
That's enough!

50:32.160 --> 50:34.160
You disappoint me.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.560
Not very wise.

53:15.440 --> 53:18.200
Use the element which brings life.

53:24.560 --> 53:25.920
Water.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.000
ls it time?

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
Yes.

54:05.920 --> 54:08.240
We've let these humans win enough.

54:09.520 --> 54:12.000
At last.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.440
What the...?

55:18.200 --> 55:19.960
Yeah, that's it! ln and out!

55:30.680 --> 55:32.080
Come on. You can do it!

55:32.080 --> 55:33.560
Move! Use your feet.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.680
Kick him!

55:47.440 --> 55:50.160
Come on, Art. Get up!

56:01.280 --> 56:02.200
Get out!

56:03.560 --> 56:05.000
Finish him.

56:06.600 --> 56:07.440
Get out!

56:17.480 --> 56:19.280
Goro! Goro!

56:19.280 --> 56:21.480
Yes! Goro!

56:39.400 --> 56:40.480
Finish him!

56:44.600 --> 56:47.280
Time to die.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.240
Finish him.

57:25.760 --> 57:27.920
Flawless victory.

57:27.920 --> 57:31.480
Your soul is mine!

57:49.080 --> 57:50.600
We can't win!

57:50.600 --> 57:53.640
How can we possibly beat
something like that?

57:53.640 --> 57:56.240
Good question.

57:56.240 --> 57:59.240
Goro can be killed.

57:59.240 --> 58:03.720
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed
by mortal men and women.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.080
You can overcome any adversary...

58:08.080 --> 58:11.880
no matter how bizarre
their powers may seem.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.600
There is always a way.

58:15.680 --> 58:18.800
Only one thing can defeat you:

58:18.800 --> 58:20.960
Your own fear.

58:20.960 --> 58:23.160
So, who says we're afraid?

58:24.840 --> 58:27.440
You must first face your fears...

58:27.440 --> 58:30.280
if you are to conquer them.

58:30.280 --> 58:33.560
You, Johnny, are afraid
you're a fake...

58:33.560 --> 58:37.560
so you'll rush into any fight
just to prove you're not.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.320
You'll fight...

58:41.320 --> 58:43.160
bravely enough...

58:43.160 --> 58:44.880
but foolishly...

58:44.880 --> 58:46.800
carelessly...

58:46.800 --> 58:48.880
and you'll be beaten.

58:51.800 --> 58:54.480
You, Sonya...

58:54.480 --> 58:58.320
are afraid to admit even you
sometimes need help.

59:02.560 --> 59:05.200
lf you are afraid to trust...

59:06.000 --> 59:08.200
you will lose.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.160
Wait.

59:16.880 --> 59:17.800
Wait.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.040
What about me?

59:20.040 --> 59:22.520
Oh, you.

59:22.520 --> 59:25.160
You fear your own destiny.

59:25.160 --> 59:28.680
You already fled once
when you went to America, so...

59:28.680 --> 59:30.760
you're guilty about Chan's death.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.880
l am responsible for Chan's death.

59:32.880 --> 59:37.120
Every mortal is responsible
for his own destiny.

59:37.120 --> 59:39.680
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?

59:41.440 --> 59:42.600
l tried.

59:42.600 --> 59:45.320
Despair is the most dangerous fear.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.320
l know this...

59:47.320 --> 59:49.480
and so does Shang Tsung.

59:49.480 --> 59:52.320
He can peer into your soul...

59:52.320 --> 59:54.960
and use the fear he sees against you.

59:55.840 --> 59:57.920
You must be prepared.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520
Liu!

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.240
You will be next.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.120
Goro's never been beaten.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.320
You go up against him,
he'll kill you.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.760
lf l don't...

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.480
then he'll finish us off
one at a time.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.800
lf l challenge him now...

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.160
l can finish this.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.040
You're making this sound simple
and it isn't.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.640
Yeah, it is.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.560
'Cause l can't let what happened
to Art happen to you.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.480
Not to you.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.160
Oh, don't you dare do this
to protect me, Johnny Cage.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.760
Trust me. l've a plan.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.080
l don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical...

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.840
self-deluded person l have ever met.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.800
You forgot "good looking."

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.520
Challenging Goro, eh?

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.600
You weren't supposed
to fight him now.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.080
Are you that eager to die?

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.640
l'm not the one who'll die.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.240
l see.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.640
You're very foolish.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.360
The true sign of a hero.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.480
You want to protect your friends.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.040
But make no mistake.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.280
They too will die...

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.920
after Goro destroys you.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.360
So what's the problem?

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.400
As you wish.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.440
As absurd as your request is,
l shall grant it.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:11.240
ln return l reserve the right
to challenge the winner myself.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.920
Or another of my choosing.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.760
ln a place designated by me
for the final battle...

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.360
of the tournament.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.240
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.480
Too late, Lord Rayden.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.480
The rules are quite clear.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.240
lt's... How do you say?

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.760
"A deal's a deal."

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.480
What have you done?

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.760
l made a choice.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.080
This is our tournament, remember?

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.480
Mortal Kombat.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.400
We fight it.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.520
Good.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.360
At last one of them has understood.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.640
Goro! Goro!

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.640
Finish him quickly.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.280
Pay me my tribute.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.760
This puny mortal
will be no problem.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.040
l'll crush him in one blow.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.600
Alright.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.800
Let's dance.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.000
Yes! Sorry.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.920
You imbecile.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.720
Damn, that hurt.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.640
Follow him.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.680
Finish him.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.680
- Yes! Yes!
- Goro! Goro!

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.480
Finish him! Finish him!

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.360
Those were $500 sunglasses,
asshole.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.000
This is where you fall down.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.960
Let me go!

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.160
Stop!

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.600
l hereby exercise my right
to challenge.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.880
l challenge her.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.280
You're a coward, sorcerer.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.720
Stand and fight.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.160
We had a deal, remember?

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.080
Mortal Kombat continues.
l'm simply...

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.000
changing the place...

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.240
as we agreed.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.840
- Sonya!
- Wait!

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.040
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle...

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.320
in the wastelands of Outworld,
where l cannot follow.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.240
We can.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.880
Rayden...Can Sonya
beat Shang Tsung?

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.680
l'm sorry.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.280
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.520
Neglected to mention it.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.400
She must accept the challenge
or there'll be no final combat.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.280
l have nothing further
to teach you, Liu Kang.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.040
You possess the knowledge.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.600
All that is lacking now is the will.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.760
You sure you don't want to go?

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.520
ln Outworld, if you look
hard enough...

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.440
you will find another guide.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.880
Good luck.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.200
They'll need it.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.120
This is not good.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.440
But l'm fine.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.520
l can deal with this.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.080
So... this is Outworld.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.800
l can see why they want
a change of scenery.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.880
We should head for that tower.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.120
He'd have taken Sonya there.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.560
l hate this place.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.520
l do. l'm telling you l hate it.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.200
A hostile environment,
l'm unprepared...

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.840
with people who want to kick my ass.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.200
lt's like being back in high school!

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.279
What's that?

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.040
Wait.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.960
What?

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.439
There's something else.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:02.880
Oh, great.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.439
What are you doing?

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.279
What are you doing?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.040
Reptile.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.200
Oh no, you don't.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.440
Well done.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.400
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.840
Kitana.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.680
Come with me.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.280
What happened here?

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.600
The same thing that will happen
to your world...

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.680
unless you prevent it.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.760
My father was the rightful ruler
of Outworld

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.160
Then his best warriors
lost ten Mortal Kombats...

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.680
and the Emperor entered the Realm...

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.240
killed my parents and adopted me...

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.320
to lay claim to the throne.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.720
but it was beautiful once...

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.720
before Shang Tsung engineered
its destruction.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.800
How can l stop this from happening
in my world?

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.120
lf l did not believe in you...

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.960
l would not have helped you.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.760
ln the Black Tower you will face
three challenges.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.320
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.360
And you must face your worst fear.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.400
l will not fight you, Shang Tsung.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.160
l am not playing your game.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.080
My sweet Sonya.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.040
There's no one else.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.080
lf you don't fight...

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.560
the Realm of Earth will
forfeit the Tournament...

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.480
and its portals will open...

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.200
to our great Emperor.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.960
You're lying.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.680
My friends will come for me.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.720
Hoping against hope.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.800
Such an endearing human trait.
l'm touched. Really.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.080
One last chance, Sonya.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.040
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.840
Go to hell.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.040
Take her away.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.240
The Emperor will be overjoyed.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.720
My friends will come.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.200
They're already here.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.640
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.680
Will you dare interfere
with the tournament...

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.240
and betray our Emperor?

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.640
ln his great wisdom, he knows
that Mortal Kombat...

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.560
cannot be won by treachery.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.840
How dare you speak to me
of treachery?

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.680
Your ignorance will lose forever...

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.960
the keys to the Realm of Earth.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.480
Very well.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.720
l challenge you.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.160
You'll fight me.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.920
l am Liu Kang...

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.320
descendant of Kung Lao.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.040
l challenge you to Mortal Kombat.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.800
Do you accept or yield?

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.760
l accept.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.440
Leave us.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.240
l will take care..

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.160
of this impudent mortal myself.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.200
Nice dress.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.280
You fool.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.400
What's that noise?

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.360
The source of all
Shang Tsung's power.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.360
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.200
Face your enemy.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.120
ls that all you've got, sorcerer?

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.040
Liu Kang!

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.920
l can see into your soul.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:36.480
You will die.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.800
Face yourself.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.280
You can look into my soul...

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.120
but you don't own it.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320
Face your worst fear.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.640
l'm not afraid of my destiny.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.080
Face me.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.680
Liu.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.280
Chan?

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.520
lt can't be you.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.680
Rayden sent me.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.800
To help you.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.680
You're not really Chan.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.200
Remember when our parents died?

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.760
You promised you'd always
take care of me?

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.520
l remember.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.400
lt's my turn to take care of you.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.040
Come with me.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.400
l forgive you for letting me die.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.120
lt wasn't my fault.

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.920
- Brother.
- No.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.320
Chan chose his own path.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.360
Every man is responsible
for his own destiny.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.600
Shang Tsung killed my brother.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.640
You're mine.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.560
The Chosen One.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.640
l am The Chosen One.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.360
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.720
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.000
Free them.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:37.400
They are mine forever.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.760
All those souls,
and you don't have your own.

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.480
l pity you, sorcerer.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.160
Save your pity for the weak.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.200
Surrender!

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.160
Never!

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.880
Flawless victory.

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.280
l knew you'd come.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.520
Chan.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.320
One day...

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.240
we will be reunited...

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.680
but until then my spirit
will always be with you.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.920
Go in peace, my brother.

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.640
Let's go home..

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.640
l've been waiting for you.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.880
What took you so long?

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.520
l guess you knew it would
end this way.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.560
Didn't have a clue.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.600
You humans are so unpredictable.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.600
l must tell you something...
you guys did great.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.360
- Bow to me!
- What is it?

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.320
The Emperor.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.680
You weak, pathetic fools.
l've come for your souls.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.920
l don't think so.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.440

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.400
Flawless victory!
