00:12.980 --> 00:15.300
Lyra?

00:45.220 --> 00:47.380
Lord Asriel
has torn up our sky.

00:51.340 --> 00:53.900
And left the world in chaos.

01:00.660 --> 01:04.100
The witches believe this is
the start of a powerful prophecy.

01:06.780 --> 01:09.980
One that could destroy
all existence...

01:14.900 --> 01:16.660
...or make it anew.

01:21.220 --> 01:24.060
It is time to prepare...

01:28.420 --> 01:30.260
...to draw sides.

02:06.220 --> 02:11.420
I know, I miss Roger,
too, but we can't go back.

02:50.860 --> 02:52.780
Lyra, look!

02:55.740 --> 02:57.180
Asriel's photogram.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.260
The city in the sky.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.100
I don't like this.

05:21.740 --> 05:23.340
Someone left in a hurry.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.620
Where is everyone?

06:01.180 --> 06:02.900
Something's happened here, Pan.

06:04.420 --> 06:06.380
Asriel?

06:06.380 --> 06:08.100
I wouldn't put it past him.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.900
Should we ask the alethiometer
where everyone is?

06:22.900 --> 06:25.020
No. We're not asking
that thing anything.

06:25.020 --> 06:26.380
Not yet.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.940
I think we can trust it.

06:27.940 --> 06:29.620
It's never lied to us.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.620
Without it, would Roger have died?

06:32.620 --> 06:35.580
No. We need to make our own way now.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.420
We have all observatories
trained upon the schism.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.940
All are reporting back the
same thing. One world.

07:06.940 --> 07:10.620
And do they have a sense of
how to block up this hole?

07:10.620 --> 07:12.300
Not as yet.

07:12.300 --> 07:16.540
A new world and Asriel simply
exploded it into being.

07:16.540 --> 07:19.340
Presumably, it was already there.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.180
Heresy!

07:21.180 --> 07:22.900
Cardinal...

07:22.900 --> 07:25.580
..it is hardly heresy any more.

07:25.580 --> 07:28.300
It is visible in the
sky above our heads.

07:30.020 --> 07:32.500
If you would just leave
the vessel to look at it.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.980
I'll not be lectured
by you on this issue.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.780
Nor should you have to be.

07:36.780 --> 07:39.460
Cardinal Sturrock, I simply ask...

07:39.460 --> 07:41.820
..that, rather than focus
on what is in the past,

07:41.820 --> 07:43.540
we focus on what is in the present.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.740
The fuse has been lit,

07:45.740 --> 07:47.380
the bomb has been exploded.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.180
The world is aware.

07:49.180 --> 07:53.020
We cannot ignore what
everyone has seen. We would lose...

07:53.020 --> 07:57.980
Damn you!

07:57.980 --> 08:00.100
Perhaps I may help?

08:00.100 --> 08:03.340
There is a witch on board, caught as
part of our round up of undesirables

08:03.340 --> 08:06.100
following this incursion.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.460
For centuries, witches have
claimed knowledge of other worlds.

08:09.460 --> 08:12.540
This witch may help us
understand this instability.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.500
Good.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.540
Do me the honour
of talking with her.

08:24.980 --> 08:27.540
That is, if you men have...

08:27.540 --> 08:29.380
..finished your discussions.

08:31.380 --> 08:35.700
We have yet to understand, what is
your precise role in all of this?

08:35.700 --> 08:37.100
My "precise role"?

08:39.460 --> 08:42.540
What did you and Asriel discuss
on the mountain on that night?

08:48.100 --> 08:51.540
I never reached Asriel,
Your Eminence.

08:51.540 --> 08:54.580
Why do I doubt that?
I have absolutely no idea.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.300
But you're right.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.380
Asriel needs stopping.

08:59.340 --> 09:03.300
This explosion requires
investigation, not ignorance.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.460
There is one, possibly
multiple worlds out there.

09:11.060 --> 09:13.660
And these witches have always known
more than they should.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.820
Let me find out what.

09:15.900 --> 09:20.220
We cannot allow this
woman to take control!

09:20.220 --> 09:22.060
You know, I look around this room...

09:23.500 --> 09:26.220
..and I see failure.

09:26.220 --> 09:31.060
Father MacPhail, who failed to even
emerge from Asriel's laboratory.

09:31.060 --> 09:33.860
Fra Pavel, who couldn't
read his alethiometer

09:33.860 --> 09:35.740
to see what was happening.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.180
I am not immune from failure myself.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.780
I didn't reach Asriel in time

09:40.780 --> 09:45.780
and I vow now never...to fail again.

09:47.660 --> 09:53.340
This witch, you believe you can
find an answer to what Asriel did?

09:56.740 --> 09:58.380
Well, I believe that I am more...

10:02.020 --> 10:04.420
...persuasive than most.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.460
Test me on what I discover.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.420
And if I discover nothing...

10:15.900 --> 10:17.260
..then, do your worst.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.700
It's a cafe.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.900
Maybe we could find
something to eat in there.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.620
You're hurting me! Ow!

11:35.620 --> 11:38.020
That'll teach you
for sneaking around.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.580
I'm sorry I scared you.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.260
You didn't scare me.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.460
Sorry I scared YOU.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.180
Please let me go.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.580
Who are you?

11:52.460 --> 11:54.100
Lyra Silvertongue.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.740
Is this your house?

11:55.740 --> 11:59.460
No. I'm Will Parry.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.620
Finally, someone else to talk to.

12:05.660 --> 12:06.740
That's Pan.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.500
Where's your demon?

12:13.740 --> 12:15.180
How's it talking?

12:18.540 --> 12:20.700
He does know not to touch me, right?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.580
That's a talking animal.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.700
No, it's not a talking animal.
That's my demon.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.140
Your what?

12:29.300 --> 12:31.540
You don't have a demon?

12:31.540 --> 12:34.060
I can't see one.

12:34.060 --> 12:36.020
That's impossible.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.340
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.620
No.

12:39.620 --> 12:40.820
Come on, Pan.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.100
Lyra Silvertongue...

12:45.100 --> 12:46.340
..wait!

12:53.060 --> 12:54.580
Don't make assumptions.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.940
He seems kind. He could be helpful.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.940
Fixed my heater yet?

13:15.940 --> 13:17.460
Heater's still busted.

13:18.740 --> 13:19.940
Compass, too.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.740
Compass has got fritzed
by the storm.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.380
Lee, you're being strange.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.020
I'm not being strange.

13:25.020 --> 13:27.660
The whole world is talking
about that tear in the sky.

13:27.660 --> 13:30.300
The witches will want us
to join the fight.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.300
We're not here to talk about the
fight, we're here to talk about Lyra

13:33.300 --> 13:35.220
and see if the witches can help us.

13:35.220 --> 13:37.540
They might know this weapon
we're looking for.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.020
Lee, look.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.740
Well, isn't that something?

14:04.100 --> 14:07.180
Lyra, we need to think sensibly.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.380
If your father was here, he's gone.

14:11.340 --> 14:13.220
So, we need a new plan.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.940
But we're going to
need friends and...

14:14.940 --> 14:16.820
We had a friend, he died.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.700
Please, think.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.980
Perhaps he's our only chance to...
Hi.

14:27.860 --> 14:29.340
Hi, Will.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.780
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.620
It's just...
I've never seen a demon before.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.980
To me, "demon"
means something evil.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.420
Er...thanks?

14:46.700 --> 14:48.500
You're not from here, are you?

14:48.500 --> 14:49.820
From this world?

14:52.180 --> 14:53.580
Me neither.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.100
How did you get here?

14:55.100 --> 14:57.780
I crossed through a window...

14:57.780 --> 14:59.700
..that my father made.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.940
You?

15:01.940 --> 15:04.100
Er...

15:04.100 --> 15:08.180
I, er, followed a cat
through a hole in the air.

15:08.180 --> 15:09.380
It sounds mad!

15:11.740 --> 15:16.020
So, there are three
worlds and two windows?

15:16.020 --> 15:17.620
All connected to here.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.260
Look, I know this world
doesn't make sense.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.580
And I don't know whether
I'm odd for not having a demon

15:22.580 --> 15:25.180
or you're odd for having one.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.220
But, maybe, we could
look around together?

15:27.220 --> 15:30.180
The three of us.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.380
That's the best idea I've heard all
day.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.940
Strange new times.

15:54.940 --> 15:58.460
It must be hard to be separated
from your sister witches?

15:59.620 --> 16:01.500
Now I am trying to help you.

16:01.500 --> 16:06.620
Not out of any...generosity of
spirit but, rather, pragmatism.

16:06.620 --> 16:09.060
Such an underrated quality.

16:13.860 --> 16:15.700
You know that you're trapped?

16:15.700 --> 16:17.260
You and your demon.

16:18.260 --> 16:21.980
All you have is the
information you carry.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.900
Share that information

16:25.900 --> 16:29.340
and we can become productive.

16:29.340 --> 16:31.580
And productive people...

16:31.580 --> 16:35.940
Well, they are generally treated...

16:35.940 --> 16:37.380
..very well.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.540
I'm looking for a child
last seen with an aeronaut

16:46.540 --> 16:49.180
and one of your kind at Bolvangar.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.340
I can tell you nothing.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.100
Hm.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.860
A witch's cloud-pine.

17:12.300 --> 17:16.180
Is it true that within it
is your ability to fly?

17:16.180 --> 17:17.580
Your ability to use magic?

17:19.060 --> 17:22.420
What is within me is vaster
than anything you can imagine.

17:54.300 --> 17:57.180
Someone must be able to tell
us how these worlds are connected.

17:57.180 --> 18:00.020
There's millions of worlds.
My father saw this one - why?

18:01.500 --> 18:04.380
I think it has to do with Dust.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.740
I think that's why I'm here.

18:06.740 --> 18:09.260
Dust? You don't have Dust?

18:09.260 --> 18:10.660
No, we have dust.

18:10.660 --> 18:13.420
I'm just guessing my dust
is not the same as your dust.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.300
Well, some people think it's sin.
"Sin"?

18:18.740 --> 18:21.980
I actually think it's more
complicated than that.

18:21.980 --> 18:25.500
I think, if bad
people think it's bad,

18:25.500 --> 18:26.740
then, maybe it's good.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.220
Did you hear that?

18:32.460 --> 18:34.380
There's someone there.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.340
Wait!

18:44.340 --> 18:46.500
I just want to talk to you!

18:53.140 --> 18:54.540
Stop!

18:54.540 --> 18:55.700
Come on!

18:59.540 --> 19:01.780
Hey! Get off!

19:01.780 --> 19:05.340
Get off! Leave me alone!

19:06.740 --> 19:08.580
Who are you and why
were you running from us?

19:08.580 --> 19:10.900
Who are you and why were you
chasing us? Because...

19:10.900 --> 19:13.540
..you're the only other
people we've seen here.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.620
We just want to know about this
place.

19:31.780 --> 19:33.820
Nah, I'm good.

19:33.820 --> 19:37.220
Don't worry, we're good at snuffling
the safe stuff, aren't we, Paola?

19:37.220 --> 19:38.580
The bread's still fresh.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.940
Where are the grown-ups?

19:43.940 --> 19:46.260
The clever ones have run.

19:46.260 --> 19:47.780
Since the attack.

19:47.780 --> 19:50.020
Spectres are everywhere.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.380
What are Spectres?

19:51.380 --> 19:54.340
Is that why no-one's here?
You don't know what Spectres are?

19:54.340 --> 19:57.340
They're bad, these Spectres?

19:57.340 --> 19:58.660
You're safe yet.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.300
You're still a girl.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.900
He's close, though, to the change.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.740
What change?

20:05.740 --> 20:07.140
When you're a man

20:07.140 --> 20:09.020
and the Spectres can get you.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.380
Just like Tullio.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.620
Who's Tullio?

20:11.620 --> 20:12.820
No-one.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.540
We've got to be careful, that's all.

20:19.100 --> 20:23.380
So, if Spectres are everywhere,
then why can't we see them?

20:23.380 --> 20:25.580
Only adults can see Spectres.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.540
What do they do?

20:28.540 --> 20:30.260
It's awful.

20:30.260 --> 20:31.940
They take your insides out.

20:33.780 --> 20:35.620
You're still alive,

20:35.620 --> 20:38.380
but everything that
makes you human...

20:40.580 --> 20:42.220
..that's gone.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.380
Our parents, it happened to them.

20:46.380 --> 20:47.700
So, it's just us now.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.340
And we're happy. Aren't we, Paola?

20:52.340 --> 20:54.220
Can run around the city now.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.540
Do what we like.

20:55.540 --> 20:57.340
And so can you.

21:00.740 --> 21:01.980
See you around.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.500
What are you doing?
Paying for the food we ate.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.980
Paying who? Eating without
paying for it is stealing.

21:13.980 --> 21:16.340
If you start behaving
like a grown-up,

21:16.340 --> 21:17.980
the Spectres will get you.

21:17.980 --> 21:20.620
What do you think of her?

21:23.540 --> 21:25.660
I don't trust her.
Nor do I.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.620
They didn't have demons either.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.180
Yeah, looks like you're
the odd one out.

21:31.180 --> 21:33.340
You're going to have
to keep him hidden.

21:34.620 --> 21:35.900
I'm not hiding!

21:37.340 --> 21:42.820
Sisters, the child
we have expected has vanished.

21:42.820 --> 21:46.380
I have invited Mr Scoresby
here to share his thoughts.

21:46.380 --> 21:48.380
Speak, Lee.

21:48.380 --> 21:51.860
Since losing Lyra,

21:51.860 --> 21:55.580
I have concerned myself with
a man named Stanislaus Grumman.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.340
Has anyone heard of him? No?

21:58.340 --> 21:59.860
Well, various rumours surround him

21:59.860 --> 22:02.460
but people say he knows the
whereabouts of some kind of object

22:02.460 --> 22:03.860
that gives magical protection.

22:03.860 --> 22:06.860
Knowing Lyra, and
the trouble she's in,

22:06.860 --> 22:09.980
I thought I might find this item
for her and take it to her.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.860
Get her that protection.
Thank you, Lee.

22:13.980 --> 22:17.220
This protection will be of
use to her wherever she is.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.860
You think so?

22:26.380 --> 22:27.700
Take this with you.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.940
And whenever you need my help,

22:32.940 --> 22:34.980
hold it in your hand and call to me.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.700
I shall hear you wherever you are.
Thank you, ma'am.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.820
Lord Asriel has opened the way
from this world to another

22:42.820 --> 22:45.620
and the child of the prophecy
is on her path.

22:45.620 --> 22:46.900
Lee can help her.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.420
We must decide our part to play.

22:59.260 --> 23:01.620
Queen Skadi?

23:01.620 --> 23:05.100
Queen Serafina Pekkala,
that man does not belong here.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.780
He is here at my
reckoning, as are you.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.980
Ruta Skadi is angry.

23:09.980 --> 23:11.260
Everyone should be angry.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.700
Sisters!

23:12.700 --> 23:16.020
Katja Sirkka has been taken
prisoner by the Magisterium.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.180
I have word they are rounding up
anyone

23:18.180 --> 23:19.940
who questions their authority.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.620
The way those animals in the
Magisterium have cracked down

23:22.620 --> 23:25.020
upon the world since the opening.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.900
Towns tightly controlled by armies.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.420
We're out of our depth here.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.180
Shut up, Hester.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.940
So, the time has come to act,

23:32.940 --> 23:36.740
to show the Magisterium that their
actions have consequences.

23:36.740 --> 23:40.340
And I am here to beg you,
Serafina Pekkala,

23:40.340 --> 23:42.460
and all the sisters here.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.260
Join me in rescuing Katya.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.180
I believe we have no choice.

23:47.180 --> 23:51.820
The prophecy was clear,
we must find the child.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.780
The prophecy is not all there is.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.380
You risk too much.

23:55.380 --> 23:58.460
The Magisterium
has thrived under your indifference.

23:58.460 --> 24:01.980
Ruta Skadi will show them
we are indifferent no more,

24:01.980 --> 24:03.700
with or without your clan's help.

24:11.820 --> 24:13.660
Lyra!

24:16.220 --> 24:18.260
Are you hungry?

24:18.260 --> 24:19.940
I made an omelette.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.620
If you have omelettes in your world.

24:31.660 --> 24:34.020
So, you're a kitchen boy, then?

24:34.020 --> 24:35.620
What?

24:35.620 --> 24:37.460
In your world, you're a kitchen boy.

24:40.860 --> 24:42.460
No.

24:43.860 --> 24:44.980
What's in this?

24:46.220 --> 24:47.260
Egg.

24:53.260 --> 24:56.700
I'm guessing you don't use
cutlery in your world either.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.860
Very funny.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.740
It's good, the "ommalat".

25:03.420 --> 25:07.660
Does Pan need to eat, too?
Some cheese or...?

25:07.660 --> 25:09.180
No.

25:09.180 --> 25:10.820
He's a demon.

25:10.820 --> 25:12.260
But thank you for the offer.

25:13.260 --> 25:16.420
I've never had to
explain a demon before.

25:16.420 --> 25:19.180
It's a part of me.

25:19.180 --> 25:23.220
He's me and I'm him, I guess?

25:23.220 --> 25:25.140
You'll soon understand.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.060
How long have you been here?

25:30.300 --> 25:31.820
Couple of days.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.100
You? Three days.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.580
I was thinking....

25:39.900 --> 25:42.700
..maybe we are better off

25:42.700 --> 25:44.540
sticking together from now on.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.460
You want me to stay?

25:48.460 --> 25:50.580
To set up camp here?

25:58.860 --> 26:02.020
I meant, we should explore together.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.220
I didn't mean you should move in.

26:04.220 --> 26:07.780
Probably easier, though, isn't it?
Now that we're sticking together.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.860
Every house here is deserted,
you don't have to move into mine.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.380
YOUR house?

26:16.380 --> 26:18.500
First, you attack me,
and then you run away.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.260
And now you're trying to stay here.

26:20.260 --> 26:22.540
You move at 100 miles an hour!

26:22.540 --> 26:24.300
"Hundred miles an hour"?

26:24.300 --> 26:25.460
It means fast.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.620
Oh, I do move quickly,
I always have.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.140
But you said we're
better off together,

26:30.140 --> 26:32.420
and so I guess you're stuck with me.

26:38.780 --> 26:41.500
I'll take the small bed if you want.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.780
I was sleeping there.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.860
OK, OK, fine. Yeah,
I'll find somewhere downstairs.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.180
Hm.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.540
Finally, you make a good decision.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.020
A very good decision.

27:31.740 --> 27:33.780
I will ask once again.

27:37.420 --> 27:40.620
Are you witches
travelling between worlds?

27:46.020 --> 27:49.060
What did you tell Asriel
of what he'd find?

27:52.740 --> 27:54.340
Please, no more.

27:56.860 --> 27:58.740
Come on, Katja.

28:00.580 --> 28:02.180
I know he had a witch lover.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.940
He boasted of it to me.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.460
Asriel is not even your concern.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.300
That's more like it.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.820
Who is my concern?

28:15.820 --> 28:18.580
The prophecy has begun
and you cannot stop it,

28:18.580 --> 28:20.900
however powerful you think you are.

28:26.380 --> 28:29.180
What is this prophecy
that I cannot stop?

28:55.180 --> 28:57.940
The prophecy is
about a girl named Lyra.

29:00.420 --> 29:02.660
What do you know about Lyra?

29:04.900 --> 29:07.260
She is known by another name.

29:13.300 --> 29:16.380
But I will not betray
the child of the prophecy.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.860
Tell me...

29:23.860 --> 29:25.940
..who Lyra Belacqua is!

29:27.540 --> 29:31.140
Yambe-Akka! Come to me!

29:34.940 --> 29:37.780
She is ready!
She has called for death.

29:50.380 --> 29:52.940
Be at peace.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.740
Stop her!

30:11.740 --> 30:13.860
Get in here now!
The witch is escaping!

30:24.980 --> 30:26.820
What is going on?

30:58.460 --> 31:01.660
There's no point in just
sitting there looking at it.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.500
At some point, we need
to start using it again.

31:05.740 --> 31:08.380
We tried it your way
and haven't gotten answers.

31:10.740 --> 31:13.660
Be honest, what do you want to know?

31:16.220 --> 31:18.580
I'd ask if my mother's
still following me.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.380
Or where my father was.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.780
Or what this place is.

31:30.820 --> 31:32.460
Whether Roger would forgive me.

31:37.740 --> 31:40.140
Or what should I do now.

31:40.140 --> 31:42.060
So ask it.

31:42.060 --> 31:44.300
Lyra, you can read it for a reason.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.860
No.

31:48.860 --> 31:51.980
We've come here to find out
about Dust and we need help.

32:16.060 --> 32:19.740
I've got the shower fixed.

32:19.740 --> 32:21.420
Shower?

32:21.420 --> 32:23.420
Washing?

32:23.420 --> 32:24.900
You wash?

32:24.900 --> 32:27.340
Yeah, at a sink.

32:27.340 --> 32:28.740
Or in a bath.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.700
Showers are like baths,
but standing up.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.620
Hmm.

32:32.620 --> 32:35.140
Well, at least, consider it.

32:35.140 --> 32:38.940
And if you change your mind,
you've got towel and soap.

32:38.940 --> 32:40.940
I'll take the first shower.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.180
I don't need a stand-up bath.

32:49.540 --> 32:51.260
Do I?

32:51.260 --> 32:54.300
That's one question you don't
have to ask the alethiometer.

33:00.660 --> 33:02.220
No, I'm fine as I am.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.860
Whoa, watch out!

33:47.220 --> 33:48.740
See?

33:48.740 --> 33:50.860
It's easy.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.460
Thanks.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.500
Don't thank me.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.740
You're the one who
taught me how to do it.

34:09.740 --> 34:12.060
You seem to have added
your own twist to it.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.700
What do you think's in there?

34:39.780 --> 34:42.380
Over here, look.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.660
Go on.

35:51.860 --> 35:53.420
It must have
been the Spectres.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.260
Lucky they can't attack us.

35:58.620 --> 36:00.500
Until we're old enough.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.220
She said I was close.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.660
Those screams aren't human!

36:16.940 --> 36:18.140
Stop!

36:21.180 --> 36:23.540
What would you hurt this cat for?
You aren't from here.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.500
You aren't from Cittagazze.
Get out of my way.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.220
Maybe I don't want to
get out of your way.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.660
Then I'll make you get out the way.

36:33.020 --> 36:35.020
Angelica, was it?

36:35.020 --> 36:37.860
Go home, Angelica.

36:43.580 --> 36:45.780
Come on.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.500
Good job at staying hidden!
You needed my help.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.940
He's no better?

37:16.420 --> 37:20.500
No. We need to dock
as soon as we can.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.780
I shall find the finest
physicians to attend to him.

37:24.780 --> 37:26.620
Or you couldn't.

37:32.060 --> 37:33.700
What are you proposing?

37:35.540 --> 37:38.420
If he lives, it's clear
the Authority wants him to lead.

37:39.500 --> 37:43.700
If he dies, then a
choice has been made.

37:49.380 --> 37:53.980
The Magisterium
needs strong leadership,

37:53.980 --> 37:57.340
not a bloated man who never knew how
to turn down a glass of wine.

37:57.340 --> 38:02.180
Mrs Coulter, why should
I trust you after what happened?

38:02.180 --> 38:04.740
I explained what happened.

38:04.740 --> 38:08.420
I made sure you were safe
and I continued up the mountain.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.420
But this is not about trust.
This is about faith.

38:11.420 --> 38:14.260
You heard the man,
he'd seal up the world.

38:14.260 --> 38:17.820
He'd try to persuade
people that this never happened.

38:17.820 --> 38:21.660
And you and I both know
the Magisterium cannot survive that.

38:21.660 --> 38:24.300
It needs you.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.300
And in return for this counsel,

38:32.300 --> 38:34.300
or this support?

38:35.580 --> 38:39.300
I give this counsel
because I believe in the right path.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.900
And, yes, with you in place,
I can pursue other interests...

38:44.900 --> 38:47.140
What interests?
That is not your concern.

38:49.020 --> 38:52.380
I will tell everyone on
the ship that the Cardinal

38:52.380 --> 38:56.740
has specifically requested
to be left alone in prayer

38:56.740 --> 38:59.540
and I will personally
tend to his wounds.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.260
Murder?

39:03.860 --> 39:06.180
I will make it my sin.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.260
As a first act...

39:11.700 --> 39:13.220
..of service.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.060
You know it's strange
that everyone's gone,

39:46.060 --> 39:47.540
but the anbarics still work.

39:48.660 --> 39:50.060
The what?

39:51.140 --> 39:52.860
The anbaric, those lights.

39:55.740 --> 39:56.980
Oh!

39:56.980 --> 39:58.500
We call them electric.

39:59.540 --> 40:00.940
Electrum's a stone.

40:02.140 --> 40:04.700
I mean, it's a jewel which
grows in the gum of trees,

40:04.700 --> 40:07.300
and it gets insects stuck
in it sometimes.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.620
Oh, you mean amber.

40:08.620 --> 40:11.740
So, your world's like my world,
but with the words mixed up.

40:12.780 --> 40:17.260
Or your world's like my world,
with all the words mixed up.

40:17.260 --> 40:21.300
The experimental theologians in
Oxford would love this place.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.580
Did you just say Oxford?!

40:24.300 --> 40:26.540
In my world there's
a place called Oxford.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.460
That's where I come from.
I'm from Oxford.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.620
That's where my window is.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.140
Two Oxfords?

40:33.140 --> 40:34.820
Worlds apart.

40:34.820 --> 40:36.820
There's an Oxford in your world,
too?

40:37.980 --> 40:39.140
Has it got scholars?

40:40.780 --> 40:42.780
I mean, there's a university, but...

40:42.780 --> 40:44.860
Maybe I can find one who can
tell me about Dust?

40:44.860 --> 40:47.380
Lyra, you're...you're from Oxford!
Will, we need to go now!

40:47.380 --> 40:49.220
Please!

40:49.220 --> 40:51.460
Show me the window.

40:51.460 --> 40:55.420
No-one will talk about Dust
in my world, but maybe in yours,

40:55.420 --> 40:57.300
they can give me answers.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.500
Answers to what?

41:01.500 --> 41:04.940
I wouldn't ask you,
if it wasn't important.

41:06.020 --> 41:08.580
I need your help.

41:08.580 --> 41:09.860
I'm not safe in my Oxford.

41:12.460 --> 41:13.980
And I'm not safe in my Oxford.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.820
I mean, it's risky for me to return,

41:19.820 --> 41:22.860
but there are things to
check on back home.

41:26.740 --> 41:28.620
Fine. First thing tomorrow morning.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.900
Thank you.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.980
You know,

41:33.980 --> 41:35.660
you do have a demon...

41:36.780 --> 41:38.340
..even if you don't know it.

41:39.980 --> 41:41.580
Can you see it?

41:41.580 --> 41:42.900
Not yet.

41:44.140 --> 41:45.420
But I will.

42:59.540 --> 43:01.820
It didn't lie to us, Lyra.

43:03.220 --> 43:05.540
It helped us find Billy Costa.

43:05.540 --> 43:08.140
It told us the truth
when we asked it.

43:09.540 --> 43:11.060
Exactly.

43:13.580 --> 43:15.220
It told us about Billy.

43:17.860 --> 43:21.180
It didn't tell us what my
father planned to do with Roger.

43:21.180 --> 43:24.660
So, it tells us the truth but...

43:24.660 --> 43:26.300
It just doesn't tell us everything.

43:30.060 --> 43:32.260
He trusts me.

43:32.260 --> 43:34.300
I need to know whether
I can trust him.

43:39.620 --> 43:42.380
So, ask it about Will.

44:15.900 --> 44:17.860
He's a murderer.

44:34.220 --> 44:35.900
He's a murderer?!

44:37.220 --> 44:38.580
The good kind.

44:39.900 --> 44:41.860
Just like Iorek.

44:45.940 --> 44:48.180
But there's something
else about him, too.

44:51.380 --> 44:53.540
He's connected to this place.

44:56.580 --> 44:58.460
He's got something to do here.

45:01.020 --> 45:03.460
I think we both do.
