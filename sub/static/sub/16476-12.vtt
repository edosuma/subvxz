WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:03.913
You asking me if I ever
had a gun to my head?

00:04.127 --> 00:05.187
Which time?

00:05.235 --> 00:06.656
No, this never happen to me.

00:06.711 --> 00:09.580
It was surprising. I'd never
been so calm in all my life.

00:09.589 --> 00:11.222
I threw my wallet
at the guy and ran away.

00:11.225 --> 00:12.294
I remember that it happened,

00:12.318 --> 00:13.984
but I can't tell you
anything about it,

00:14.125 --> 00:15.293
except I can describe the gun

00:15.349 --> 00:17.447
down to the scratch
on the barrel.

00:17.512 --> 00:19.495
Gun to your head,
what would you do?

00:19.513 --> 00:21.328
Kept hearing those words.

00:21.393 --> 00:23.147
I thought it was
a great opportunity.

00:23.195 --> 00:28.065
After all,
crisis reveals character.

00:31.644 --> 00:33.199
Good morning, everyone.

00:33.246 --> 00:34.834
Hi, uh, I'm chunk Palmer.

00:34.881 --> 00:36.736
I'll be your liaison
for the day.

00:36.783 --> 00:39.438
We here at tac are aware
that you have many options.

00:39.485 --> 00:40.615
Of how you spend your time

00:40.662 --> 00:42.708
and we appreciate
you spending it with us.

00:42.755 --> 00:44.419
You all have been carefully selected

00:44.466 --> 00:46.412
to participate in today's mock jury.

00:46.459 --> 00:48.556
It's an opportunity to express
your thoughts and feel...

00:48.603 --> 00:50.661
Smells good.
What is that, coffee?

00:51.364 --> 00:52.518
I miss coffee so much.

00:52.565 --> 00:53.995
There's a little left
if you want some.

00:54.042 --> 00:55.287
Oh, you're sweet, but, uh,

00:55.334 --> 00:56.497
it's not good for my ticker.

00:56.544 --> 00:57.799
I got a heart thing.

00:57.846 --> 00:59.633
All for $200 a day.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.993
And a hot lunch.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.970
So, uh, please,
let's get out of this rain.

01:03.017 --> 01:04.375
Please follow me.

01:06.646 --> 01:08.142
As we proceed through
the security checkpoint,

01:08.189 --> 01:09.368
if you look to your left,

01:09.415 --> 01:11.713
you might catch a glimpse
of one of our analysts

01:11.760 --> 01:13.272
in their natural habitat.

01:13.319 --> 01:14.849
The indispensable tac employees,

01:14.896 --> 01:16.451
Cable Mccrory and Danny James.

01:16.498 --> 01:17.610
Hi, everyone.

01:17.657 --> 01:19.554
I always wanted to be
in one of these focus groups.

01:19.601 --> 01:23.115
I mean, I'm not a white male
aged 18 to 49,

01:23.215 --> 01:24.851
but I remember what
I liked when I was.

01:24.912 --> 01:27.495
Before we settle in
to our new home in mock court,

01:27.612 --> 01:30.537
now might be a good time
for a bathroom break.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.926 --> 01:52.980
Ladies and Gentlemen.

01:53.027 --> 01:56.349
This is the talented
and delightful, Marissa Morgan.

01:56.396 --> 01:59.668
You can't hide anything from
Marissa, but why would you?

02:00.011 --> 02:01.196
Any bit of information

02:01.243 --> 02:02.801
about yourself that you've left

02:02.849 --> 02:06.074
online or a scrap of paper,
Marissa can use it

02:06.079 --> 02:09.663
to make a motivational matrix
for each of you.

02:09.769 --> 02:10.773
Thank you, Chunk.

02:10.854 --> 02:12.532
Hi, everyone.

02:12.605 --> 02:15.243
I promise this is
not an invasive process.

02:15.291 --> 02:18.271
Now, you will be
hearing presentations.

02:18.318 --> 02:19.597
By our in-house Attorney,
Benny colã³n.

02:19.645 --> 02:21.216
Oh, don't listen
to a word she says.

02:21.263 --> 02:23.118
She used to work
for the government.

02:23.165 --> 02:24.889
Mind-control specialist.

02:24.987 --> 02:26.729
We will be interviewing some,

02:26.784 --> 02:29.382
if not all of you,
for your responses.

02:29.429 --> 02:31.493
Now, this will help
give us a better sense.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.595
Of how the real jury
will respond.

02:33.642 --> 02:36.723
We will also be measuring
your biometrics,

02:36.770 --> 02:38.433
using these wrist monitors.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.227
Mind-control devices.

02:40.274 --> 02:41.537
They record your heart rate,

02:41.584 --> 02:43.472
skin temperature,
perspiration levels,

02:43.519 --> 02:46.208
and other factors that indicate
your emotional state.

02:46.255 --> 02:47.334
In real time.

02:47.381 --> 02:48.769
To make you more pliable.

02:48.816 --> 02:51.472
And as you can tell, it hasn't
worked on Benny at all.

02:51.852 --> 02:52.839
Laurel Guthrie,

02:52.886 --> 02:54.049
you are juror number 18.

02:54.096 --> 02:55.818
Please find your seat.

02:55.865 --> 02:59.324
All right, everyone,
you are the jurors.

02:59.372 --> 03:01.098
There are no wrong answers.

03:01.161 --> 03:02.215
Are there right ones?

03:02.262 --> 03:03.292
If you don't like
what Benny says,

03:03.339 --> 03:04.493
we would like to know that.

03:04.540 --> 03:07.087
If you don't like
how Benny says things,

03:07.134 --> 03:08.397
well, we might agree with you.

03:08.444 --> 03:10.601
If you don't like the way Benny looks...
Hey, hey.

03:10.656 --> 03:13.538
Then that is on chunk
because he picked out this suit.

03:14.541 --> 03:15.680
We do what we can.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.105
All right. We're good to go.

03:17.152 --> 03:19.010
Just need the guy
with the glasses.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.738
So, uh, Bull, I am
in no way questioning.

03:24.785 --> 03:26.206
What we are all doing here.

03:26.253 --> 03:27.349
Ah, what are we doing here?

03:27.396 --> 03:28.951
The ancient druids
believed that, uh,

03:28.998 --> 03:30.443
our souls were immortal,

03:30.490 --> 03:32.746
and that these physical vessels
were only temporary.

03:32.793 --> 03:33.989
Of course there are others.

03:34.036 --> 03:35.982
Believe that we
are just projections.

03:36.029 --> 03:38.126
In a simulated universe,
characters in a video game.

03:38.173 --> 03:39.728
I wasn't speaking
so existentially.

03:39.775 --> 03:41.866
Oh, okay.
I just want to let you know

03:41.914 --> 03:45.014
I am happy to be spending
my time digging up dirt.

03:45.038 --> 03:48.295
On a scumbag ceo who's being
sued by our scumbag coo.

03:48.342 --> 03:49.938
Because they're fighting
over their business.

03:49.985 --> 03:52.474
You have a firm grasp
on this case. Excellent.

03:52.521 --> 03:53.934
I just want to be clear.

03:53.981 --> 03:55.377
One of these high-dollar cases.

03:55.424 --> 03:56.912
Pays for a dozen
where the client

03:56.959 --> 03:59.314
is in need and
deserves our help.

03:59.362 --> 04:01.583
I'm responsible for everyone
in this building, Danny.

04:01.630 --> 04:03.009
And according to the lease,

04:03.056 --> 04:04.052
the building itself.

04:04.099 --> 04:06.624
- Noted.
- Thank you.

04:08.814 --> 04:10.851
Okay, you two,
we're locked and loaded.

04:10.898 --> 04:12.753
What's the question
of the day, Bull?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.396
Well, it's gonna be a good one.

04:14.443 --> 04:15.655
Oh, come on.

04:15.702 --> 04:16.697
Please, no.

04:16.745 --> 04:17.991
Yeah.

04:18.038 --> 04:19.059
Is a hot dog a sandwich?

04:19.106 --> 04:20.769
This could get out of control
in a hurry.

04:20.815 --> 04:22.062
It's perfect.

04:22.108 --> 04:23.972
Ask the question, please, Benny.

04:24.019 --> 04:25.841
It's not two slices of bread.

04:25.888 --> 04:28.969
Okay? It's just not.

04:29.016 --> 04:31.246
Anyway, I have a question
about my opening argument.

04:31.293 --> 04:32.205
It violates

04:32.252 --> 04:33.482
my five-minute rule.

04:33.529 --> 04:35.430
I really would like
to cut the following

04:35.478 --> 04:37.047
four paragraphs.

04:37.366 --> 04:38.678
Hold on, Benny.

04:38.725 --> 04:40.255
What's going on
with mock juror 18, Marissa?

04:40.302 --> 04:41.748
Uh...

04:41.794 --> 04:43.124
Laurel Guthrie.

04:43.172 --> 04:44.438
Age 34.

04:44.548 --> 04:46.361
She's from fort Greene,
Brooklyn.

04:46.408 --> 04:47.830
Heart rate accelerating.

04:47.877 --> 04:50.332
Respiration's increasing.

04:50.379 --> 04:52.616
She's pretty fidgety.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.013
She seems really nervous.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.085
Everybody down!

05:06.890 --> 05:11.358
<font color=#FF00FF>*BULL*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01 Episode 12</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>"Stockholm Syndrome"</font>

05:17.338 --> 05:18.799
Okay.

05:20.133 --> 05:21.931
Everybody, calm down.

05:21.978 --> 05:23.389
Calm down.

05:23.436 --> 05:25.625
Is anybody hurt?

05:25.672 --> 05:27.310
Marissa?
Are you okay?

05:27.396 --> 05:28.662
I'm okay.

05:28.709 --> 05:31.272
I think it's just from the dust.

05:31.319 --> 05:33.086
You're okay.

05:33.156 --> 05:35.277
She's okay.

05:35.324 --> 05:37.270
Guys.

05:37.317 --> 05:39.116
Hi, can you hear me in there?

05:40.484 --> 05:41.538
Is anyone on?

05:41.623 --> 05:43.676
We're here, cable. Status check.

05:43.724 --> 05:45.263
Just a few minor injuries,

05:45.311 --> 05:47.115
but the corridor caved in.

05:47.927 --> 05:49.811
- What in the hell?
- What do you think?

05:49.944 --> 05:51.959
- Nobody move!
- Nobody move!

05:52.521 --> 05:53.614
She's got a gun!

05:53.662 --> 05:54.685
Call 911.

05:54.733 --> 05:55.818
Okay.

05:55.866 --> 05:57.498
Laurel.

05:57.545 --> 05:59.493
Laurel.

05:59.540 --> 06:01.461
Listen to me, Laurel.

06:01.508 --> 06:02.995
Everybody stay down
on the ground.

06:03.042 --> 06:04.317
Hey, if you're gonna pull a gun.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.996
In my courtroom,
you're gonna point it at me.

06:06.044 --> 06:06.876
And no one else.

06:06.923 --> 06:08.076
Understood?

06:08.123 --> 06:10.003
Here.

06:10.050 --> 06:11.871
You know the layout
to my building.

06:11.918 --> 06:13.151
You found a way to be a part

06:13.199 --> 06:14.909
of the mock jury,
and you smuggled in.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.331
What looks like a
3D-printed firearm,

06:17.458 --> 06:18.753
to get past the metal detector,

06:18.800 --> 06:22.048
and you fabricated
an explosive device.

06:22.095 --> 06:24.784
But there's nothing in our
background profile on you.

06:24.831 --> 06:26.495
That would indicate
you're a violent person.

06:26.543 --> 06:27.796
You don't know
anything about me!

06:27.843 --> 06:28.788
All right.

06:28.835 --> 06:31.369
Then why don't you tell me?

06:32.339 --> 06:33.672
You're all right.

06:36.911 --> 06:37.965
You need to relax.

06:38.012 --> 06:39.675
You've done a lot of planning.

06:39.722 --> 06:40.933
To get to this moment.

06:40.980 --> 06:42.543
I know it's important to you.

06:42.590 --> 06:43.711
Tell us why.

06:43.758 --> 06:46.484
My husband.

06:47.003 --> 06:48.651
You have to get
my husband out of jail.

06:48.698 --> 06:50.009
Okay.

06:50.056 --> 06:51.574
Then talk to us.

06:51.777 --> 06:53.491
We're all listening.

06:54.418 --> 06:55.948
Aren't we?

06:55.995 --> 06:57.084
I read you, Bull.

06:57.131 --> 06:59.161
Pulling up everything
i can find on him now.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.597
Okay, her husband's name
is Gordon Guthrie,

07:01.644 --> 07:04.242
42, formerly of fort Greene,
Brooklyn,

07:04.290 --> 07:06.936
presently five years
into a 15-year sentence.

07:06.983 --> 07:08.403
He copped to it, Bull.

07:08.450 --> 07:10.523
Entered a guilty plea.

07:10.937 --> 07:14.201
They-they owned and operated
a small Pharmacy.

07:14.248 --> 07:15.377
Everybody, get over there.

07:15.424 --> 07:18.498
Okay. Take it easy, Laurel.

07:19.498 --> 07:20.850
It's gonna be all right.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.323
Just relax.

07:26.725 --> 07:28.123
Let's just do
everything she says.

07:28.170 --> 07:30.595
Mm-hmm.

07:32.232 --> 07:34.263
Our records indicate
that you're a pharmacist.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.187
I was.

07:35.234 --> 07:36.623
We lost the Pharmacy.

07:36.670 --> 07:37.758
We lost everything.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.502
- Not your skills.
- Explosives are basic chemistry.

07:40.549 --> 07:41.876
It may be simple science,

07:41.924 --> 07:43.964
but the motivation
is pretty complex.

07:44.011 --> 07:45.298
You've got my attention.

07:45.345 --> 07:46.709
Look, I've done everything
the right way.

07:46.756 --> 07:48.235
Studied the law for five years.

07:48.282 --> 07:49.610
Pursued every legal means
to get him free.

07:49.658 --> 07:50.731
But he pled guilty.

07:50.778 --> 07:52.139
There's no grounds for appeal.

07:52.186 --> 07:54.215
No, no, no,
the motion to reopen the case.

07:54.262 --> 07:56.417
Would have to come
from the da's office.

07:56.464 --> 07:57.844
Okay.

07:57.892 --> 08:02.220
And that...
Is what you want...

08:02.268 --> 08:03.791
To get me to do.

08:03.838 --> 08:05.893
Yeah.

08:05.940 --> 08:08.621
I see.

08:09.555 --> 08:10.823
Do you know there's

08:10.870 --> 08:13.203
a psychology
behind bomb-making, Laurel?

08:13.251 --> 08:14.203
It's interesting.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.595
It's about control.

08:15.642 --> 08:17.203
You feel disenfranchised.

08:17.251 --> 08:19.765
The legal system took
your voice away.

08:19.812 --> 08:21.477
But you didn't blow
up a courthouse...

08:21.524 --> 08:22.643
Or a jail.

08:22.690 --> 08:24.738
You came here,

08:24.785 --> 08:27.549
and you focused
your rage on this.

08:27.596 --> 08:30.540
Very specific,
hopefully nonlethal.

08:30.774 --> 08:33.245
Means of solving your problem.

08:33.292 --> 08:34.722
I'm not here to kill anyone.

08:34.770 --> 08:36.416
I hope you mean that.

08:36.462 --> 08:37.493
Look at all these people.

08:37.539 --> 08:39.052
They're scared.

08:39.099 --> 08:40.395
I mean, you're
scaring them, Laurel.

08:40.443 --> 08:43.664
I need to know that
they are not in danger.

08:43.712 --> 08:45.594
You understand that?
That's my responsibility.

08:45.665 --> 08:47.360
Look at me.

08:47.406 --> 08:48.835
Do we understand each other?

08:48.883 --> 08:51.097
Yeah.

08:51.144 --> 08:53.110
Now, tell me about this case.

08:53.259 --> 08:55.001
So, there were
some discrepancies.

08:55.048 --> 08:58.004
In the FDA-mandated Opioid
prescription reporting,

08:58.051 --> 08:59.782
but it could've just been
a mistake by our bookkeeper.

08:59.829 --> 09:01.749
- And what was his name?
- Donovan snell.

09:01.796 --> 09:03.543
But the prosecutor, Weinsbach,

09:03.590 --> 09:04.887
claimed that my Gordon,

09:04.934 --> 09:06.680
my quiet, bookish Gordon

09:06.727 --> 09:08.248
who loved nothing more

09:08.295 --> 09:10.406
than watching old movies,
doing crossword puzzles.

09:10.454 --> 09:11.345
And gardening...

09:11.398 --> 09:12.890
- Dude sounds like he's 80.
- Dude.

09:13.399 --> 09:14.997
That he was
a neighborhood drug dealer.

09:15.044 --> 09:17.023
And that he got into a Turf War

09:17.070 --> 09:19.368
with actual drug dealers,
Tommy and Bobby Vega.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.861
And then he said that Gordon

09:21.908 --> 09:24.073
killed Tommy in a drug deal
gone wrong.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.074
I know this case.

09:25.121 --> 09:26.220
What?

09:26.268 --> 09:28.402
- They had no evidence.
- None.

09:28.449 --> 09:30.720
Just an unimpeachable
undercover source.

09:30.774 --> 09:33.219
Working the case, and they swore

09:33.384 --> 09:34.673
that this source

09:34.721 --> 09:36.087
witnessed Gordon come in.

09:36.135 --> 09:38.977
And pull the trigger against
Tommy Vega and murder him.

09:39.025 --> 09:41.690
And you never got to hear
his testimony in open court?

09:41.737 --> 09:42.648
No.

09:42.695 --> 09:44.774
He took a plea deal.

09:44.998 --> 09:47.320
He never got a chance
to confront his accuser.

09:47.367 --> 09:48.430
Well, they shouldn't
have done that.

09:48.477 --> 09:49.531
They railroaded him.

09:49.578 --> 09:51.358
It's just a game to them,

09:51.704 --> 09:54.038
and they rig the rules
against people like us.

09:56.477 --> 09:58.440
Your husband deserved
a fair trial,

09:58.487 --> 10:00.282
an outcome determined

10:00.330 --> 10:02.001
by a jury of his peers.

10:02.048 --> 10:03.078
I learned about you.

10:03.125 --> 10:05.438
You deliver jury verdicts.

10:05.485 --> 10:09.051
I would've taken this case
just based on its merits.

10:09.098 --> 10:11.221
You didn't even take my calls.

10:15.796 --> 10:18.529
Stand back, stand back.
Get back, please.

10:21.234 --> 10:23.400
Let's go, let's go.

10:25.239 --> 10:26.767
A few more units are on the way.

10:26.814 --> 10:28.294
Let's go.

10:28.341 --> 10:29.905
Set up a perimeter
around the block.

10:29.952 --> 10:31.205
No one enters the building.

10:31.252 --> 10:33.142
Clear and secure all floors.

10:33.189 --> 10:34.779
Let's go!

10:37.666 --> 10:40.106
Guys. Guys, I got video.

10:40.153 --> 10:41.483
Cable, you okay?

10:41.530 --> 10:43.275
Lieutenant Tharder.

10:43.322 --> 10:44.719
We've got 25 people
trapped in there,

10:44.766 --> 10:46.287
being held hostage at gunpoint.

10:46.334 --> 10:47.189
Male or female?

10:47.236 --> 10:49.181
Female, early 30s and agitated.

10:49.228 --> 10:51.016
Clear all non-essential
personnel.

10:51.063 --> 10:52.928
You got comms inside
with the terrorist?

10:52.975 --> 10:53.986
Can I talk to her?

10:54.033 --> 10:55.898
Bull seems to be doing
most of the negotiating.

10:55.945 --> 10:58.524
You did take his
weekend seminar, didn't you?

10:58.571 --> 10:59.968
Alternative techniques
to negotiation.

11:00.015 --> 11:01.969
What approach is he using
to establish rapport?

11:02.016 --> 11:05.931
Whatever it is,
it seems to be working.

11:05.978 --> 11:08.809
What this comes down to, Laurel,
is a case of mistaken identity.

11:08.856 --> 11:11.180
We spend so much time
worrying about.

11:11.227 --> 11:12.938
how others perceive us.

11:12.985 --> 11:15.816
How we dress, how we speak,
how we look.

11:15.863 --> 11:17.173
Why?

11:17.523 --> 11:21.113
To build trust. To be seen.

11:21.402 --> 11:23.801
The DA didn't see
your husband in court.

11:23.886 --> 11:25.230
That's clear.

11:25.278 --> 11:26.285
Just like these people.

11:26.332 --> 11:27.362
These frightened,
confused people,

11:27.409 --> 11:30.423
they don't really
see you right now.

11:30.470 --> 11:32.535
They see a woman with a gun.

11:32.933 --> 11:34.480
But I see you.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.207
I do.

11:36.871 --> 11:38.840
And I know you're a good person.

11:39.496 --> 11:40.667
I want to help you.

11:40.714 --> 11:41.876
You will help me.

11:41.923 --> 11:44.301
Not under duress I won't.

11:44.751 --> 11:46.628
Why today, specifically?

11:46.676 --> 11:49.284
Why did you choose this day
to do all of this?

11:49.331 --> 11:52.824
They're transferring
my husband today

11:53.246 --> 11:55.156
to the same prison
as Bobby Vega.

11:55.496 --> 11:56.815
It's a death sentence.

11:56.902 --> 11:58.826
And you want me
to save him in a day?

11:58.873 --> 11:59.953
Yes.

12:00.001 --> 12:01.457
Once you know the lie,

12:01.505 --> 12:03.122
you can make a call to the ADA.

12:03.169 --> 12:04.732
Have them put a halt
on the transfer,

12:04.779 --> 12:06.300
and then just
re-open the case.

12:06.347 --> 12:07.835
That's a lot to ask.

12:07.882 --> 12:09.262
Then what?

12:09.309 --> 12:12.910
They bluffed him
into copping that plea.

12:13.714 --> 12:15.795
Gordon and I were inseparable.

12:16.310 --> 12:18.338
We lived together,
we worked together.

12:18.385 --> 12:20.082
We kept no secrets
from each other.

12:20.129 --> 12:21.881
They got the wrong man.

12:21.998 --> 12:25.732
And this witness, this source...

12:26.021 --> 12:28.148
She's the one who put
the gun to my husband's head.

12:28.195 --> 12:29.855
Laurel, I told you not
to point that gun

12:29.903 --> 12:31.254
at anyone in this room but me.

12:31.325 --> 12:33.458
I searched five years
to find out the name

12:33.506 --> 12:35.621
of the FBI Agent that they used.

12:35.668 --> 12:37.601
To play games with
my husband's life.

12:38.605 --> 12:42.840
Special Agent Danielle James.

12:52.394 --> 12:53.824
Absolutely no one has been...

12:53.871 --> 12:56.946
At this point, there are
no confirmed deaths,

12:57.040 --> 12:59.087
though we do not know
the extent of the injuries

12:59.134 --> 13:00.364
or the number of people involved.

13:00.411 --> 13:03.692
NYPD has confirmed
an explosion on the 22nd floor

13:03.739 --> 13:06.470
in the offices of
the Trial Analysis Corporation.

13:06.517 --> 13:08.730
Bomb squad personnel
is in the building.

13:08.777 --> 13:10.507
We're told this is
a domestic act.

13:10.554 --> 13:13.646
More details to come
as events unfold.

13:15.017 --> 13:17.414
Laurel, let me tell you
what we're gonna do.

13:17.461 --> 13:19.407
You're gonna tell me?

13:19.454 --> 13:21.609
You are gonna get what you need,

13:21.656 --> 13:23.453
but you are not gonna get
what you asked for.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.140
I'm not getting on the phone,

13:25.188 --> 13:27.157
I'm not making
any demands for you.

13:27.204 --> 13:32.203
I am not asking anyone
for anything on your behalf.

13:32.460 --> 13:34.874
But I will take your case,

13:35.148 --> 13:38.335
and I will also take
that gun right now.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.203
That's the deal.

13:40.382 --> 13:41.996
No.

13:42.043 --> 13:44.941
The gun, it's the only
reason you're listening.

13:44.988 --> 13:48.351
No, I'm listening
because I'm interested.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.180
I'm curious to know
the truth here,

13:50.227 --> 13:53.250
and I'm curious about
Danny's testimony on the stand.

13:53.297 --> 13:55.910
But the gun is getting in the way.

13:55.957 --> 13:57.145
Now, you have a choice.

13:57.192 --> 13:59.128
You can never pull that trigger,

13:59.176 --> 14:00.041
in which case

14:00.089 --> 14:01.858
this is sort of
a silly, tiresome pose...

14:01.905 --> 14:03.284
Or?

14:03.331 --> 14:04.661
Or you can pull the trigger,

14:04.708 --> 14:06.988
and something
unspeakable happens.

14:07.035 --> 14:10.200
And I think we both know
that's not an option.

14:10.247 --> 14:11.493
What do you mean?

14:11.541 --> 14:14.261
The firing pin on these
3D-printed firearms.

14:14.309 --> 14:16.564
is notoriously unreliable.

14:16.611 --> 14:17.707
By the looks of it,

14:17.754 --> 14:20.575
chemistry may be your specialty,

14:20.800 --> 14:22.891
but engineering isn't.

14:25.552 --> 14:28.005
Give me the gun...

14:28.099 --> 14:31.190
And you will get everything
you came here for.

14:44.105 --> 14:45.905
It's okay.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.913
He got her to give him the gun.
I'll be damned.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.114
Move ahead with the sweep.

14:58.161 --> 15:00.175
There's already been
a detonation.

15:00.222 --> 15:02.719
We're not gonna assume there
aren't any other devices.

15:02.766 --> 15:03.997
Bull could just ask her.

15:04.052 --> 15:06.309
We're not gonna take the word
of someone who takes hostages.

15:06.387 --> 15:08.169
I don't believe
that place is secure

15:08.270 --> 15:09.551
until that thing tells me it is.

15:09.598 --> 15:11.928
It looks like there's structural
damage from the blast.

15:11.975 --> 15:14.153
They're trapped behind
a collapsed structural beam.

15:14.276 --> 15:16.534
Cutting through may be
the only option.

15:19.696 --> 15:22.163
Here you go.

15:23.134 --> 15:24.692
Here, take one of these.

15:24.878 --> 15:27.871
These will help with the dust.

15:28.817 --> 15:32.349
Yeah, I'm okay. We're stuck
in this mock courtroom.

15:32.396 --> 15:34.409
Hey, can we get out of here?

15:34.456 --> 15:36.353
We're clearing the area,
Mr. colã³n.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.458
Please stay back until
we've completed our assessment.

15:42.836 --> 15:44.627
They're not gonna find
any other explosives.

15:44.675 --> 15:46.855
Maybe not.
Before the bomb went off,

15:46.902 --> 15:48.698
her heart rate and breathing
were red-lining.

15:48.745 --> 15:50.058
Now she is strangely calm.

15:50.105 --> 15:51.668
All the nervousness and anxiety.

15:51.715 --> 15:54.229
of anticipation is all gone now.

15:54.276 --> 15:56.888
She's just sad, and hoping
we can help her.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.083
Hey, cable, how long
do they estimate.

15:59.131 --> 16:00.404
It'll take to get us
out of here?

16:00.607 --> 16:02.570
Lieutenant Tharder says
about an hour,

16:02.617 --> 16:04.047
but I'm not supposed
to tell you that.

16:04.094 --> 16:06.808
- Something about s.O.P.
- Okay.

16:06.855 --> 16:08.309
I'm gonna make use of it.

16:08.356 --> 16:09.511
Let's do a mock trial.

16:09.558 --> 16:11.579
You weren't just
trying to talk her down.

16:11.626 --> 16:13.348
You legitimately want
to work her case.

16:13.395 --> 16:15.416
At this point, it's really
not a big difference

16:15.463 --> 16:16.960
from how we were
gonna spend our day.

16:17.007 --> 16:21.041
Okay, are you in shock?
You need medical attention?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.033
You okay?

16:32.877 --> 16:34.487
Yeah.

16:35.984 --> 16:37.839
I remember her husband's case.

16:37.886 --> 16:39.440
I was undercover for months

16:39.487 --> 16:40.975
trying to nail
the Vega Brothers.

16:41.022 --> 16:43.019
I was in the next room the night
Gordon Guthrie showed up.

16:43.066 --> 16:45.666
- You comfortable talking about it?
- I just did.

16:45.784 --> 16:48.716
We're talking about whether
a man goes away for murder.

16:48.763 --> 16:50.393
I might have
a few more questions.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.519
Such as?

16:51.566 --> 16:52.963
You said you were
in the next room.

16:53.010 --> 16:54.598
How come the assailant
didn't see you?

16:54.645 --> 16:56.967
What was your state of mind?
What were you doing?

16:57.014 --> 16:58.835
When was the last time
you slept?

16:58.882 --> 17:01.705
Was your view obstructed?
Maybe, most importantly,

17:01.752 --> 17:03.673
how come you didn't testify?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.880
It wasn't my decision.

17:06.505 --> 17:09.348
You'd have to ask that idiot
Ada Weinsbach.

17:15.022 --> 17:18.762
Hey, you still on speaking
terms with Carey Weinsbach?

17:18.942 --> 17:20.448
Yeah. Want me to dig?

17:20.494 --> 17:21.630
Well, we either dig into this,

17:21.678 --> 17:24.117
or we... start digging
into that barricade.

17:24.165 --> 17:26.161
Working a case
in a sealed-off room

17:26.223 --> 17:28.923
with the possibility of
an undetonated ordnance.

17:28.970 --> 17:29.933
That'll be relaxing.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.668
There is no further threat here.

17:31.723 --> 17:34.356
- Except for Claustrophobia.
- And ?

17:34.574 --> 17:36.898
It would benefit everyone
to take their minds elsewhere.

17:36.945 --> 17:39.175
She blew up the room and
held them all at gunpoint.

17:39.222 --> 17:41.432
Come on, Bull,
you can't reward her.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.171
I'm not looking to
reward bad behavior.

17:43.218 --> 17:45.548
I'm looking to help everyone
through a traumatic event.

17:45.595 --> 17:47.550
And if, in the process,
we can assist

17:47.597 --> 17:50.080
this damaged and distraught
young woman,

17:50.135 --> 17:51.788
and give her the trial
she never had.

17:51.835 --> 17:52.814
That's good, too.

17:52.861 --> 17:54.882
You're already
prosecuting the case.

17:54.929 --> 17:56.593
I was thinking of
starting with the defense.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.461
- But you can prosecute.
- Right.

17:58.508 --> 18:00.788
Hey, Marissa, do you think,

18:00.835 --> 18:03.433
with a bare-bones evaluation
of their behavioral tendencies,

18:03.480 --> 18:04.934
you can empanel a full jury?

18:04.981 --> 18:06.636
With an appeal
towards curiosity,

18:06.683 --> 18:08.938
an established interest
in participating

18:08.985 --> 18:11.074
in the judicial process,
and the fact.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.743
There's nothing else to do here,
uh, maybe nine.

18:13.790 --> 18:16.537
If you bribe 'em,
I'll take the over.

18:16.584 --> 18:17.647
If you're right, you get
to be the judge.

18:17.694 --> 18:20.107
Oh, my God.
You guys are insane.

18:20.155 --> 18:21.651
Are you actually
re-running the trial?

18:21.698 --> 18:22.585
We're stuck here.

18:22.632 --> 18:24.354
Danny, you wanted to try a case

18:24.401 --> 18:25.588
with meaning today.

18:25.635 --> 18:27.593
Let's make it meaningful.

18:29.593 --> 18:32.095
Everybody, if I could have
everyone's attention, please.

18:32.142 --> 18:34.564
On behalf of everyone
here at TAC,

18:34.611 --> 18:38.928
I'd like to apologize
for your inconvenience today.

18:39.373 --> 18:41.271
The authorities have assured us

18:41.318 --> 18:42.972
that they'll have us out of here

18:43.019 --> 18:44.098
in an hour or so.

18:44.145 --> 18:47.045
I know you got more
than you bargained for today.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.559
You thought you were gonna
be on a mock jury.

18:51.451 --> 18:54.818
What if we tried a real case?

18:57.178 --> 18:59.514
And by the time we're done,
we'll be out of here.

18:59.561 --> 19:00.924
What the hell are you
talking about?

19:00.971 --> 19:02.723
Obviously,
if anyone doesn't want

19:02.771 --> 19:03.960
to participate,
they're free to sit out.

19:04.007 --> 19:08.122
But for the curious, Benny colã³n
will be re-trying

19:08.170 --> 19:09.957
her husband, Gordon Guthrie,

19:10.004 --> 19:12.736
who was incarcerated five years
ago on murder charges.

19:12.783 --> 19:14.871
For the defense,
Dr. Jason Bull.

19:14.918 --> 19:16.940
And the lovely and loquacious.

19:16.987 --> 19:19.825
Honorable Chunk Palmer
presiding.

19:20.582 --> 19:22.160
This is a chance.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.355
To determine whether
or not Laurel Guthrie.

19:24.403 --> 19:26.988
was unjustly driven
to desperate violence.

19:27.036 --> 19:28.331
by a corrupt legal system.

19:28.379 --> 19:30.581
You'll not only
have the chance to provide

19:30.629 --> 19:33.823
answers for her husband,
whose life hangs in the balance.

19:33.870 --> 19:35.717
You'll also be empowered

19:35.764 --> 19:38.119
to render justice on her actions

19:38.166 --> 19:40.997
toward every innocent person
in this room.

19:41.153 --> 19:42.457
That's absurd.

19:42.504 --> 19:43.833
Why would we do crap for her?

19:43.880 --> 19:45.660
I'm gonna sweeten the pot.

19:45.707 --> 19:47.370
A thousand dollars danger pay

19:47.417 --> 19:49.806
to anyone who participates.

19:50.215 --> 19:52.278
Can I see a show of hands?

19:56.017 --> 19:57.598
What else you gonna do?

19:57.981 --> 19:59.807
I'm in.

19:59.854 --> 20:02.025
Yep. Woman 2: Sure.
What the hell.

20:02.182 --> 20:04.053
I'm in. Woman 3: Okay. I'm in.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.288
Man 2: I'm in.

20:05.335 --> 20:08.349
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

20:08.396 --> 20:10.985
Looks like we have a jury.

20:11.032 --> 20:12.595
Court is in session.

20:12.642 --> 20:15.401
Please re-take your seats.

20:16.638 --> 20:18.177
Good luck, Counselor.

20:18.387 --> 20:20.045
Your honor.

20:26.581 --> 20:28.872
Mr. Weinsbach,
thanks for getting back.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.277
Well, you contacted me
through my office, land line,

20:31.325 --> 20:33.040
unlisted cell,
and three relatives,

20:33.087 --> 20:34.284
so I turned on the news.

20:34.331 --> 20:36.386
They're saying a bomb
already went off.

20:36.433 --> 20:38.846
Is everyone okay?

20:38.893 --> 20:42.250
Uh... it's a fluid situation.

20:42.297 --> 20:44.485
We need electronic copies
of the court recordings.

20:44.532 --> 20:45.929
and transcripts of
a five-year-old case.

20:45.976 --> 20:47.630
<i>State of New York vs Gordon Guthrie.</i>

20:47.677 --> 20:49.765
Okay, I remember it. I'll
send what I've got.

20:49.835 --> 20:53.123
 Great. I also may need your help
pulling some strings.

20:53.171 --> 20:55.577
So I can Jack into
the D.O.C. Security cameras.

20:55.718 --> 20:58.065
No visual on any
undetonated ordnance yet.

20:58.112 --> 20:59.475
We're gonna have to
carefully extract.

20:59.522 --> 21:00.601
Piece by piece.

21:00.649 --> 21:02.979
My god, what a mess.
I'll get it started.

21:03.026 --> 21:04.372
- Who's that?
- Um...

21:04.419 --> 21:06.476
Oh, a colleague of Marissa's.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.587
I'll transfer you now.

21:09.554 --> 21:11.835
Hey, can I play with the robot?

21:11.883 --> 21:12.914
No.

21:13.077 --> 21:14.649
Marissa, it's Carey Weinsbach.

21:14.696 --> 21:16.392
Yeah, I know, counselor.
It's video, I can see.

21:16.439 --> 21:18.062
Uh, are you all right?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.896
Hoping you can provide
some details we're missing.

21:19.943 --> 21:21.088
On the Guthrie case.

21:21.135 --> 21:23.779
- What is going on there?
- We're about to start.

21:23.827 --> 21:25.742
- Voir dire right now, hang on a second.
- Did you say voir...

21:25.812 --> 21:29.230
Shall we address the
elephant in the room?

21:29.277 --> 21:31.774
We can all hear the
sounds of rescue workers

21:31.821 --> 21:34.043
on the other side of that pile.

21:34.090 --> 21:38.339
Men and women in uniform
fighting to rescue us.

21:38.386 --> 21:40.719
Who here doesn't trust the police?

21:43.024 --> 21:44.374
Move to strike, your honor.

21:44.449 --> 21:46.015
Yeah, you two are out.

21:47.829 --> 21:50.423
Please go ahead, Counselor.

21:50.712 --> 21:52.821
He's emphasizing trust
of the uniform.

21:52.868 --> 21:54.337
Means he's putting
your testimony

21:54.454 --> 21:55.389
at the center of his case.

21:55.436 --> 21:56.991
That's how it should be.
There's nothing else.

21:57.038 --> 21:58.401
Well, he's gonna need
to stack the jury

21:58.448 --> 21:59.769
with people who have family.

21:59.816 --> 22:02.263
In the military,
police or the fdny.

22:02.310 --> 22:04.140
Jurors three, seven, nine,

22:04.187 --> 22:06.609
and 17 all fit the bill.

22:06.656 --> 22:09.215
I'll tell him.

22:09.584 --> 22:11.283
Oh, Mr. Weinsbach.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.697
I just saw Danny James.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.952
Would you tell her I'm sorry?

22:15.999 --> 22:17.127
About what?

22:17.175 --> 22:19.146
We all experienced
a trauma today.

22:19.193 --> 22:20.556
I have to admit, when I
heard the first explosion,

22:20.603 --> 22:21.524
I thought I was dead.

22:21.571 --> 22:22.959
When I heard the second one,

22:23.006 --> 22:25.845
I was at least happy to know
I was alive.

22:25.893 --> 22:27.540
I don't know if we all
had the same experience.

22:27.588 --> 22:29.799
Who thought the first
explosion was the loudest?

22:29.846 --> 22:31.626
I see.

22:31.673 --> 22:32.602
And the second?

22:32.649 --> 22:34.028
Hmm.

22:34.075 --> 22:35.939
And does anyone here think.

22:35.986 --> 22:38.432
There was only one explosion?

22:38.479 --> 22:40.176
Move to strike, your honor.

22:40.332 --> 22:41.879
You are excused.

22:42.473 --> 22:43.645
Thank you.

22:44.252 --> 22:46.007
There was only one explosion.

22:46.054 --> 22:47.784
Yet no one on our jury
is sure of that

22:47.831 --> 22:49.844
they're all hearing
the second one

22:49.891 --> 22:50.954
in their heads already.

22:51.001 --> 22:52.989
Reconstructive recollection, Bull?

22:53.036 --> 22:56.117
This case hinges on memory.
Memories can be altered

22:56.164 --> 22:58.928
by time, by repetition,
by any number of factors.

22:58.975 --> 23:02.098
You want a jury
who trusts Danny and her memory.

23:02.145 --> 23:04.180
And I want a jury who trusts.

23:04.228 --> 23:06.118
Neither Danny, nor her memory.

23:06.227 --> 23:07.762
Transcripts and court recordings

23:07.809 --> 23:09.764
from the trial have
been downloaded.

23:09.811 --> 23:10.740
Why do you look nervous?

23:10.786 --> 23:12.704
I also spoke to Benny's friend

23:12.752 --> 23:13.801
at the DA's office.

23:13.848 --> 23:14.978
According to the transcripts,

23:15.025 --> 23:16.604
he was three days into the trial

23:16.651 --> 23:18.039
before he offered the plea deal.

23:18.086 --> 23:19.549
I just want to know why
he offered a deal at all.

23:19.596 --> 23:22.121
If he had Danny's testimony.

23:23.157 --> 23:25.079
- He believed it was compromised.
- Bull?

23:25.126 --> 23:27.457
You are going to need
to tread lightly here.

23:27.504 --> 23:28.482
Why is that?

23:28.529 --> 23:29.784
While she was under,

23:29.831 --> 23:32.286
Danny's handler at the
Bureau told the AdA

23:32.333 --> 23:34.221
that she missed
multiple check-ins,

23:34.268 --> 23:35.932
including scheduled drug tests.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.191
Danny went native?

23:37.238 --> 23:38.259
They never got any proof.

23:38.306 --> 23:39.824
Well, if the defense
got ahold of that.

23:39.872 --> 23:41.404
They would have ripped her apart
on the stand.

23:41.451 --> 23:42.772
No, Danny would never.

23:42.819 --> 23:45.466
She left the FBI
not long after this case.

23:45.513 --> 23:46.943
Speaking of Gordon Guthrie,

23:46.990 --> 23:48.469
it took some doing,

23:48.516 --> 23:50.713
but I finally got the live feed, Bull.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.541
At rikers correctional,
Laurel's husband.

23:53.588 --> 23:54.675
It's coming up now.

23:54.722 --> 23:56.372
Oh, thank you, cable.

23:56.427 --> 23:58.660
I want to get a look
at this guy.

23:58.708 --> 24:00.662
This Guthrie?

24:00.995 --> 24:02.258
He looks like a minnow.

24:02.305 --> 24:04.318
About to be fed to the sharks.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.329
The look of
a wrongly convicted man.

24:06.376 --> 24:08.356
on his way to an unjust end.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.400
Because of a corrupt FBI Agent,

24:10.447 --> 24:12.732
who subsequently
quit the Bureau.

24:12.780 --> 24:14.208
Bull, you know
that's not who Danny is.

24:14.256 --> 24:16.539
Driving a peaceful woman
to an act of madness,

24:16.586 --> 24:18.302
making prisoners of us all,

24:18.372 --> 24:21.043
in order to get her husband
the trial he was denied.

24:21.091 --> 24:23.179
- Don't say it.
- That's how I'll depict Danny.

24:23.226 --> 24:24.630
The best narrative
wins the case.

24:24.678 --> 24:29.688
But only the truth
will set us free.

24:38.432 --> 24:41.197
While it seems the threat inside
has been neutralized,

24:41.244 --> 24:43.390
the bomb squad
is not taking any chances.

24:43.437 --> 24:45.059
A unit is securing the building.

24:45.106 --> 24:47.757
<i>Keep in mind, at least 20
people are still trapped.</i>

24:47.811 --> 24:50.343
<i>inside the tac offices,
in what we're told.</i>

24:50.391 --> 24:53.500
<i>Has been
an unconventional negotiation.</i>

24:53.626 --> 24:55.745
So, you gonna put
me on the stand?

24:55.792 --> 24:57.271
Don't mock mock court.

24:57.318 --> 24:58.681
Benny, this is ridiculous.

24:58.728 --> 25:01.542
I prefer Bull passionate,
not fanatical.

25:01.589 --> 25:03.185
ADA Weinsbach
had some reservations.

25:03.232 --> 25:04.411
About your testimony.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.788
You know what?
I was undercover

25:05.835 --> 25:07.948
on Tommy Vega for months, man.

25:07.995 --> 25:09.358
You know what he liked?

25:09.405 --> 25:10.826
Guns, drugs,

25:10.873 --> 25:12.419
paranoia.

25:12.466 --> 25:14.521
You know what he
didn't like? Sleep.

25:14.568 --> 25:16.832
So if I didn't come up
to meet my handler,

25:17.100 --> 25:18.601
I had a damn good reason.

25:18.648 --> 25:19.893
I believe you.

25:19.940 --> 25:22.396
And I believe that
the jury will, too.

25:22.443 --> 25:23.906
Guthrie should've gotten life.

25:23.953 --> 25:25.975
Instead, he got a deal.
And my time under.

25:26.022 --> 25:27.401
Got burned.

25:27.448 --> 25:28.602
I did my job.

25:28.649 --> 25:30.104
Show that passion on the stand.

25:30.151 --> 25:31.347
And nothing will stop you.

25:31.394 --> 25:33.618
Nothing?

25:46.436 --> 25:48.772
All right, come to order.

25:48.969 --> 25:50.791
Now, the original trial

25:50.838 --> 25:53.193
lasted for three days
of testimony

25:53.240 --> 25:54.654
before a plea
bargain was reached.

25:54.732 --> 25:56.238
We'll be reading
parts of the transcript.

25:56.285 --> 25:58.107
From the original trial
with the help.

25:58.154 --> 26:01.474
of a few of our volunteers that
you guys struck from the jury.

26:02.224 --> 26:04.517
Dr. valeron, you will
be reading the role.

26:04.572 --> 26:07.141
of an expert in the distribution
of pharmaceuticals.

26:07.188 --> 26:09.118
Could you tell us
about Opioid manufacturing.

26:09.165 --> 26:10.411
And distribution?

26:10.458 --> 26:12.746
In typical pharmacies,
individual pills

26:12.793 --> 26:14.148
can be tracked in quantity

26:14.195 --> 26:15.357
and Schedule II Narcotics

26:15.404 --> 26:17.284
are stored in a safe.
However,

26:17.331 --> 26:19.462
Mr. Guthrie
ran a compounding Pharmacy

26:19.471 --> 26:20.896
where he received
bulk quantities

26:20.943 --> 26:22.264
of components
that could be mixed

26:22.311 --> 26:23.524
to various strengths.

26:23.571 --> 26:24.767
That makes it more difficult

26:24.814 --> 26:26.035
to track specific amounts.

26:26.082 --> 26:28.095
Yes. Now, we logged everything.

26:28.142 --> 26:30.072
It was our own bookkeeper
who brought the discrepancies

26:30.119 --> 26:31.439
to our attention.

26:31.487 --> 26:33.072
The numbers did not add up.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.144
I had been the bookkeeper
at Guthrie's Pharmacy

26:35.191 --> 26:36.236
for seven years.

26:36.283 --> 26:38.272
And you spotted discrepancies

26:38.319 --> 26:39.548
in the Opioid register.

26:39.595 --> 26:41.809
and brought it
to the authorities?

26:41.856 --> 26:43.971
Yes, there were
more prescriptions being filed

26:44.019 --> 26:45.987
than actual customers
coming into the store.

26:46.035 --> 26:47.514
And this led you to believe

26:47.561 --> 26:48.824
the prescriptions
were being falsified?

26:48.871 --> 26:49.850
Objection. Leading.

26:49.897 --> 26:50.960
That's not in the script.

26:51.007 --> 26:52.122
It should have been

26:52.184 --> 26:53.238
if Guthrie had a good lawyer.

26:53.286 --> 26:54.763
Objection, argumentative.

26:54.810 --> 26:55.556
Against who?

26:55.603 --> 26:57.099
The defense lawyer is not here

26:57.146 --> 26:58.425
to defend himself.

26:58.472 --> 27:00.605
Well, you're
defending him poorly.

27:00.810 --> 27:02.908
This is where I bang the gavel.

27:03.509 --> 27:05.674
You were the arresting
officer who took Mr. Guthrie

27:05.721 --> 27:07.042
- into custody?
- Yes.

27:07.089 --> 27:11.275
I've been a detective
with the NYPD for 19 years.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.962
I was analyzing the paper trail

27:14.173 --> 27:15.985
that ran through
Guthrie Pharmacy.

27:16.032 --> 27:18.545
When Tommy Vega was murdered.

27:18.592 --> 27:20.489
They kicked our door in
during dinner.

27:20.536 --> 27:23.161
They dragged Gordon out
screaming, he was terrified.

27:24.986 --> 27:26.207
Special AGENT James...

27:26.255 --> 27:29.166
Objection. She's
no longer FBI, she quit.

27:29.486 --> 27:31.086
She was when
the events took place.

27:31.134 --> 27:32.735
- What are we, time traveling now?
- No.

27:32.782 --> 27:35.671
We're in a farcical, made-up
universe of your own design.

27:35.718 --> 27:38.132
What, no one else is
allowed to make up rules?

27:38.178 --> 27:40.575
Objection. Your Honor, I believe
he's ridiculing your Court.

27:40.623 --> 27:43.315
Gavel. I will use it.

27:43.684 --> 27:45.205
Go on, Counselor.

27:45.252 --> 27:47.493
Ms. James,
you were a Decorated

27:47.541 --> 27:50.344
Agent of the Federal Bbureau
of Investigation

27:50.391 --> 27:52.894
for over 12 years; You
put your life on the line

27:52.942 --> 27:54.497
countless amount of times,

27:54.545 --> 27:56.350
including going undercover.

27:56.397 --> 27:58.130
When you were assigned
to Tommy Vega,

27:58.178 --> 27:59.762
how did you get close to him?

27:59.809 --> 28:01.088
It was my job.

28:01.135 --> 28:02.698
The supreme challenge
of undercover work

28:02.745 --> 28:03.832
is not pretending.

28:03.879 --> 28:05.167
I had to find honesty.

28:05.214 --> 28:07.670
in the legend I'd
created for myself.

28:08.137 --> 28:11.465
Vega was a frightening
and intimidating man.

28:11.512 --> 28:13.676
I simply
allowed a part of myself

28:13.723 --> 28:16.036
to find that attractive.

28:16.506 --> 28:19.348
Now, the night of
Tommy Vega's murder,

28:19.881 --> 28:21.408
what did you see?

28:21.455 --> 28:23.810
I was alone with Tommy Vega
in his apartment.

28:23.857 --> 28:25.623
He said he had a supplier
coming to see him.

28:25.693 --> 28:26.912
and that
he had some business to do.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.416
So I excused myself
to the adjoining bathroom,

28:29.463 --> 28:31.160
where I kept watch
through a crack.

28:31.207 --> 28:33.195
Vega then buzzed in his contact.

28:33.242 --> 28:34.873
And as soon as the door opened,

28:34.928 --> 28:36.514
there was an immediate gunshot.

28:36.607 --> 28:38.358
Vega was shot without a word?

28:38.405 --> 28:40.584
Yes. The assailant
stepped into the apartment.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.145
and fired two more shots
into Vega,

28:42.193 --> 28:43.193
who was still on the ground.

28:43.241 --> 28:44.640
And that's when
you got a clear look at him?

28:44.687 --> 28:46.107
It was Gordon Guthrie.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.942
Had you known
Mr. Guthrie previously?

28:48.990 --> 28:50.231
He was on my radar

28:50.279 --> 28:52.206
as a low-level supplier.

28:52.253 --> 28:54.383
- of Pharmaceutical Grade Narcotics.
- No.

28:54.430 --> 28:56.051
You're positive?

28:56.168 --> 28:58.460
Not a doubt in my mind.

29:00.228 --> 29:02.049
<i>According to
the jury scoreboard,</i>

29:02.096 --> 29:03.963
it's 12 to zero against Gordon.

29:04.056 --> 29:05.619
Mm.
Well, Bull,

29:05.666 --> 29:06.961
I don't need to know the score.

29:07.009 --> 29:08.197
to know you're getting smoked.

29:08.244 --> 29:10.357
You did a nice job
teeing Danny up.

29:10.404 --> 29:11.758
But don't celebrate yet.

29:11.805 --> 29:13.569
A decent cross
will tear her apart.

29:13.616 --> 29:14.884
You think I'm unreliable?

29:14.955 --> 29:17.373
This jury won't believe a word
you said when I'm done with you.

29:17.420 --> 29:18.265
- Bull?
- Yes.

29:18.312 --> 29:19.408
This professional...

29:19.455 --> 29:22.411
- by the book version of you will crumble.
- Bull.

29:22.458 --> 29:24.349
Bring it on.

29:24.885 --> 29:26.406
If this is you as a lawyer,

29:26.453 --> 29:28.408
it's not hard to see
why you hate lawyers.

29:28.455 --> 29:30.510
You should've gotten
out in front of it, Benny.

29:30.557 --> 29:31.739
Out in front of what?

29:31.787 --> 29:32.912
Bull, think twice about

29:32.960 --> 29:34.423
what you're gonna do to Danny.

29:34.470 --> 29:35.482
I have.

29:35.529 --> 29:37.351
Danny needs to resolve her past.

29:37.398 --> 29:39.103
I'm going to attack her.

29:39.290 --> 29:41.882
And it's gonna help.

29:48.742 --> 29:51.228
How big was this opening
in the bathroom door?

29:51.306 --> 29:52.799
Big enough.
I was able to see through.

29:52.847 --> 29:54.884
About a one-inch opening where
the door didn't quite close.

29:54.932 --> 29:55.961
One inch?

29:56.009 --> 29:57.504
So you got one eye in there.

29:57.551 --> 29:58.978
The other one was shut?

29:59.087 --> 30:00.107
Yes.

30:00.154 --> 30:01.587
That'll play with
your depth perception.

30:01.689 --> 30:03.744
So this five-year-old
memory.

30:03.806 --> 30:04.822
You have of the event,

30:04.870 --> 30:06.556
you're aware that
memories can be.

30:06.604 --> 30:08.014
Altered, right?

30:08.062 --> 30:09.491
Because when you
remember something,

30:09.538 --> 30:12.361
you're just bringing up
an encoded copy of the event,

30:12.408 --> 30:15.016
not the actual event itself.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.985
For instance,
our jury this morning

30:17.033 --> 30:18.859
thought they heard
two explosions,

30:18.906 --> 30:19.954
but there was only one.

30:20.002 --> 30:21.939
That's not possible,
because I know what I saw.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.634
Ah, and that's
what I want to talk about.

30:24.682 --> 30:27.540
What I was just describing
is a healthy brain remembering.

30:27.841 --> 30:30.915
What kind of pharmaceuticals did
you see being consumed on site?

30:31.079 --> 30:34.474
Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Codeine,

30:34.521 --> 30:36.204
and several designer
psychedelics.

30:36.252 --> 30:39.124
And did you take any
of these pharmaceuticals?

30:45.072 --> 30:46.298
I can't say.

30:46.375 --> 30:48.638
Ah. Now, your role undercover.

30:48.702 --> 30:50.065
With the Vegas was to be

30:50.112 --> 30:51.783
Something of a groupie, right?

30:51.869 --> 30:54.158
And that would have
meant doing drugs.

30:54.283 --> 30:56.505
Otherwise, they would have
been suspicious of you.

30:56.736 --> 30:58.031
So I'll ask again.

30:58.212 --> 30:59.675
What drugs did you do
that night?

30:59.722 --> 31:00.901
What are you doing?

31:00.948 --> 31:03.515
I'm asking you a simple
and relevant question.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.560
Would you answer it, please?

31:13.750 --> 31:16.017
It's called 2C-B.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.727
That's a schedule I narcotic.

31:18.774 --> 31:20.229
With Hallucinogenic properties.

31:20.276 --> 31:22.989
Surely, the FBI didn't
expect you to take that drug.

31:23.036 --> 31:24.720
Couldn't you have just faked it?

31:24.954 --> 31:27.461
Vega put it in our drinks.

31:27.650 --> 31:30.431
Then I followed protocol,
which was to induce vomiting.

31:30.479 --> 31:31.492
Protocol?

31:31.540 --> 31:32.680
You followed protocol?

31:32.728 --> 31:34.133
Well, you didn't check in
with your handler,

31:34.181 --> 31:35.110
I think that was protocol.

31:35.158 --> 31:36.829
Maybe you were just too high.

31:36.908 --> 31:38.739
And since the ADA
didn't trust you,

31:38.786 --> 31:39.876
I'm kind of wondering.

31:39.926 --> 31:42.584
Why should this court trust you?

31:44.603 --> 31:45.912
I don't care.

31:46.158 --> 31:48.775
Okay? I don't care if that woman
believes me, either.

31:48.845 --> 31:50.751
I am not her
social worker, Bull.

31:50.798 --> 31:53.134
She needs real help.
Not whatever the hell it is.

31:53.189 --> 31:54.353
You think you're doing here.

31:54.432 --> 31:56.056
So you're gonna quit again?

31:56.537 --> 31:57.791
This isn't real, Bull.

31:57.838 --> 32:00.164
When I found you,
you left the FBI

32:00.212 --> 32:01.862
under suspicious circumstances.

32:01.909 --> 32:02.896
Nobody trusted you.

32:02.943 --> 32:04.339
I've told you what happened.

32:04.408 --> 32:07.200
to Tommy Vega.
Now I've told you twice.

32:07.247 --> 32:08.644
If you don't believe me,

32:08.691 --> 32:09.870
that's on you.

32:09.917 --> 32:13.251
You didn't tell me before today.
You never asked!

32:15.963 --> 32:20.393
Maybe I should've set off a bomb
to get your attention.

32:20.534 --> 32:22.323
Then maybe you'd trust me.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.781
Cable. How much longer?

32:37.828 --> 32:39.249
I can't take this.
'Cause otherwise,

32:39.296 --> 32:40.359
I'm coming out. I don't care.

32:40.406 --> 32:41.794
If I have to walk
through jagged metal.

32:41.841 --> 32:42.720
Um...

32:42.767 --> 32:44.421
That's not advisable.

32:44.468 --> 32:46.156
They're still removing debris.

32:46.203 --> 32:47.524
You got to get me out of here.

32:47.571 --> 32:49.235
I am trapped in here
with a crazy person.

32:49.282 --> 32:52.038
I thought Bull
had it under control.

32:52.085 --> 32:54.509
He's the one I'm talking about.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.836
Ten to two in your favor.

32:58.883 --> 33:00.882
Way to go.
All you had to do was destroy

33:00.930 --> 33:02.214
your relationship
ten to two in with Danny.

33:02.261 --> 33:04.108
Laurel's getting
a verdict, Marissa.

33:04.155 --> 33:06.519
It's not a real verdict.
It doesn't mean anything.

33:06.566 --> 33:08.490
Yes, it does. Benny!

33:09.329 --> 33:11.582
You were pretty rough
on Danny up there.

33:11.629 --> 33:13.540
I'm gonna have to clean
it up on the redirect.

33:13.704 --> 33:15.919
- I need something from you.
- The redirect.

33:15.966 --> 33:17.396
We're gonna need
to put a pin in that.

33:17.443 --> 33:19.110
At least for now.

33:19.196 --> 33:21.171
I know it's been
a long day, but it's important.

33:21.219 --> 33:22.421
To remind everyone.

33:22.469 --> 33:25.462
This is about the life
of a human being.

33:25.688 --> 33:26.797
Ms. Guthrie,

33:26.844 --> 33:28.707
you never got the chance
to testify

33:28.754 --> 33:30.167
on your husband's behalf

33:30.214 --> 33:31.535
during the original trial.

33:31.582 --> 33:33.412
What would you like us
to know about him?

33:33.459 --> 33:35.102
Gordon's a good man.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.507
<i>We met in school.</i>

33:36.554 --> 33:38.344
<i>He was very studious.</i>

33:38.524 --> 33:40.611
<i>And he took
his classes seriously.</i>

33:40.658 --> 33:42.312
He asked me to study with him.

33:42.359 --> 33:43.889
And we've been
together ever since.

33:43.936 --> 33:44.924
Until five years ago.

33:44.971 --> 33:46.235
Yes.

33:46.548 --> 33:48.452
We lived together.
We worked together.

33:48.499 --> 33:49.995
We were never
out of each others' sight.

33:50.042 --> 33:51.024
Never?

33:51.173 --> 33:52.698
He would go for a walk
most nights.

33:52.745 --> 33:54.133
<i>He likes the cold air.</i>

33:54.180 --> 33:56.238
<i>Do you miss him?</i>

33:56.674 --> 33:58.395
<i>Yes.</i>

33:58.442 --> 34:01.050
<i>And since he was dragged away...</i>

34:01.487 --> 34:02.900
Welcome to rikers.

34:02.947 --> 34:05.247
Bobby Vega,
get back in your cell.

34:06.016 --> 34:08.013
<i>You have been totally alone.</i>

34:08.060 --> 34:10.116
With only your worst fears.

34:10.163 --> 34:12.020
To keep you company.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.579
Yes.

34:15.797 --> 34:17.822
<i>And that's why
you set off a bomb </i>

34:18.079 --> 34:20.693
in a room full
of innocent people?

34:20.739 --> 34:22.027
I'm sorry.

34:22.074 --> 34:23.053
Okay?

34:23.100 --> 34:24.655
I am so sorry.

34:24.702 --> 34:26.090
<i>But I need help.</i>

34:26.137 --> 34:27.545
<i>Gordon needs help.</i>

34:27.678 --> 34:29.802
<i>And I didn't know
where else to get it from.</i>

34:29.849 --> 34:32.174
<i>They're gonna kill him.</i>

34:32.710 --> 34:35.358
I never meant to hurt anybody.

34:45.289 --> 34:47.085
You're willing
to give up your freedom.

34:47.132 --> 34:50.091
To win his freedom.

34:53.187 --> 34:55.327
You're willing
to sacrifice everything.

34:55.373 --> 34:57.532
Yes.

35:02.039 --> 35:03.494
Bull?

35:03.541 --> 35:05.696
The robot's done with her work.
A path's been cleared.

35:05.743 --> 35:07.506
Only a few more moments
before they're ready

35:07.553 --> 35:08.699
to pull people out.

35:08.746 --> 35:09.708
The robot's a she?

35:09.755 --> 35:10.601
Apparently.

35:10.648 --> 35:12.778
But we're in closing arguments.

35:12.825 --> 35:14.271
It won't be long.

35:14.318 --> 35:15.900
What you've seen here
today, folks,

35:15.948 --> 35:18.408
is called classic legal tactic.

35:18.455 --> 35:21.854
The defense has tried to put
the key eyewitness on trial.

35:21.901 --> 35:24.926
Because the facts
don't suit their narrative.

35:26.296 --> 35:28.861
The only reason to question.

35:28.908 --> 35:31.889
Agent James is to create doubt.

35:32.226 --> 35:34.303
The only reason
to attack her character

35:34.351 --> 35:37.186
is to stir up ugly
and distasteful emotions

35:37.234 --> 35:39.872
that will distract you
from the simple truth.

35:40.492 --> 35:42.065
Don't let that happen to you.

35:42.367 --> 35:44.143
Find Gordon Guthrie guilty.

35:44.406 --> 35:46.114
Again.

35:50.663 --> 35:53.320
Each one of us experienced
this day differently.

35:53.445 --> 35:56.222
And each one of you is gonna
tell the story of this day.

35:56.269 --> 35:58.190
Differently. Who's right?

35:58.237 --> 36:00.685
Well. Subjective, right?

36:00.794 --> 36:03.053
You listened
to Ms. James testimony.

36:03.100 --> 36:06.390
What you didn't know is that
she was under the influence.

36:06.437 --> 36:09.211
of a Hallucinogen
during the event she described.

36:09.375 --> 36:13.072
Game changer. Nobody sees
the world in its entirely.

36:13.119 --> 36:14.500
Can't be done.

36:14.664 --> 36:16.511
Not even the best of us.

36:19.781 --> 36:22.242
You have to find him not guilty.

36:23.410 --> 36:24.976
Thank you.

36:32.596 --> 36:33.750
Mr. Foreman.

36:33.797 --> 36:36.384
I understand the jury
has reached a verdict.

36:36.572 --> 36:37.930
We did, Your Honor.

36:37.977 --> 36:39.588
What say you?

36:40.174 --> 36:42.463
We find the defendant,

36:42.588 --> 36:44.706
Gordon Guthrie...

36:46.010 --> 36:47.088
Not guilty.

36:47.136 --> 36:48.810
Mm!

36:50.377 --> 36:51.844
I can't believe it. I told you.

36:51.947 --> 36:53.150
Okay.
Thank you.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.504
Okay!

36:54.551 --> 36:57.419
That's one way it could've gone.

36:58.955 --> 37:02.228
I just shaped a narrative
to get specific people.

37:02.322 --> 37:05.181
to believe a specific version
of reality.

37:05.830 --> 37:07.451
That's it, that's the last one.

37:07.658 --> 37:10.158
And I think I just showed you
that even well-meaning people.

37:10.206 --> 37:11.997
Can be blinded to the truth.

37:12.127 --> 37:14.291
- What truth?
- Watch your step here.

37:14.478 --> 37:16.493
Clear.

37:16.728 --> 37:18.437
All right, everyone.

37:18.484 --> 37:19.595
It's safe.

37:19.678 --> 37:21.211
We've cleared an exit.

37:22.479 --> 37:25.119
The truth is, you
don't know Danny.

37:25.549 --> 37:27.980
Danny would never
put an innocent man in prison.

37:28.027 --> 37:29.640
This is our mock courtroom,

37:29.687 --> 37:31.317
this is where is where
we practice our arguments.

37:31.364 --> 37:33.064
And if I was defending you,

37:33.189 --> 37:34.753
I would've said, Hey!

37:34.800 --> 37:36.747
This one works...

37:36.794 --> 37:38.290
What are you waiting for?

37:38.337 --> 37:40.450
You people can go.

37:40.744 --> 37:43.696
Okay, people. Come on.
Let's move.

37:43.744 --> 37:45.752
Let's get to safety.

37:45.939 --> 37:47.674
Come on, people.

37:47.830 --> 37:50.158
But if I was on
the side of justice,

37:50.307 --> 37:52.228
I think I would've done Benny's
cross a little differently.

37:52.330 --> 37:55.728
I would've said something like,
Special  Agent James.

37:55.845 --> 37:58.401
When did Guthrie
wind up on your radar?

37:58.449 --> 38:01.405
He was, um, making small buys
from the Vega Brothers.

38:01.452 --> 38:02.773
And the meeting that night?

38:02.820 --> 38:04.149
They wanted to up
their purchases.

38:04.196 --> 38:05.484
They knew he had a Pharmacy,

38:05.531 --> 38:06.652
it'd make a good front.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.788
So, wait a minute.
The Vegas had been

38:08.834 --> 38:10.080
to the Pharmacy?

38:10.127 --> 38:11.924
They knew everything
about the place

38:11.971 --> 38:13.795
including that he had a wife?

38:16.338 --> 38:18.588
Would you please describe
the assailant for me?

38:18.728 --> 38:21.759
White male, mid-30s, six one.

38:21.869 --> 38:23.736
Approximately 190 pounds.

38:23.783 --> 38:25.127
Eyes?
Brown.

38:25.236 --> 38:28.877
What hand? 9mm glock
in his right hand.

38:29.813 --> 38:31.310
And what was he wearing?

38:31.463 --> 38:33.947
Brown corduroys, blue pea coat,

38:34.072 --> 38:37.165
and a blue and orange knit cap
with a logo that said New York.

38:37.213 --> 38:38.884
Islanders.

38:39.127 --> 38:41.956
Oh, Gordon.
What did you do?

38:43.603 --> 38:45.048
We define people,

38:45.095 --> 38:47.017
especially those closest to us,

38:47.064 --> 38:49.128
by the questions
we choose to ask,

38:49.175 --> 38:51.588
and the answers
we choose to believe.

38:51.986 --> 38:54.509
Please raise your hand if the
alterations in Danny's testimony

38:54.557 --> 38:56.882
would've changed your vote.

39:01.211 --> 39:02.822
And there you have it.

39:02.877 --> 39:05.043
Thank you
for you participation today.

39:05.090 --> 39:06.981
I know it was a challenge.

39:08.744 --> 39:10.572
And you know the real answer.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.214
Your husband's a killer.

39:13.090 --> 39:14.945
<i>If it's any consolation,</i>

39:14.992 --> 39:17.142
<i>he probably got a lighter
sentence than he deserves.</i>

39:17.220 --> 39:19.533
Payback time, Gordo.

39:19.612 --> 39:21.211
Hey, look at me!

39:21.865 --> 39:24.032
Hey! Hey!

39:32.220 --> 39:34.924
<i>And has a better chance
of surviving than you think.</i>

39:35.017 --> 39:36.578
Take it easy.

39:39.353 --> 39:41.004
You're in trouble,

39:41.051 --> 39:43.306
but we're gonna do everything
we can to help you.

39:43.439 --> 39:45.056
I never meant to hurt anyone.

39:45.197 --> 39:48.412
I know. But your husband did.

39:48.459 --> 39:49.521
He had that in him,

39:49.568 --> 39:51.957
and he used
all of his powers to keep you

39:52.004 --> 39:53.717
from seeing it.

39:53.884 --> 39:55.799
She's all yours, lieutenant.

39:56.049 --> 39:58.733
Go easy on her.

40:02.372 --> 40:05.662
Ah. This is so good.

40:05.709 --> 40:06.905
Who wants a drink?

40:06.952 --> 40:07.964
I'm down.

40:08.012 --> 40:09.754
You guys aren't sick
of each other already?

40:09.802 --> 40:10.636
Freedom,

40:10.684 --> 40:11.581
cable. Just...

40:11.629 --> 40:14.067
Let's indulge our freedom.

40:14.190 --> 40:15.781
Bull.

40:17.895 --> 40:18.950
Come on.

40:18.998 --> 40:20.865
We're going for a drink.

40:23.230 --> 40:24.829
Hey. Did you see that?

40:25.020 --> 40:26.616
Jurors stuck around,

40:26.663 --> 40:28.026
of their own volition.

40:28.073 --> 40:29.426
I love it.

40:29.496 --> 40:31.154
I know you quit the FBI.

40:31.201 --> 40:33.534
Because they couldn't recognize
the devotion

40:33.582 --> 40:34.733
you bring to your work.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.535
You're not the Bureau.

40:36.582 --> 40:37.895
No. We're not.

40:38.117 --> 40:40.251
But what we do
matters to people.

40:41.064 --> 40:43.864
And I believe in you completely.
