WEBVTT

00:37.384 --> 00:39.450
Come on, do another one.

00:52.484 --> 00:53.951
Go for it.
It's all you.

00:54.018 --> 00:55.984
Okay, here it goes.

01:03.550 --> 01:05.084
That's what
I'm talking about.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.851
What are you doing?

01:24.917 --> 01:26.018
Dancing.

01:26.084 --> 01:28.084
With your tongue?
Total lesbo.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.250
Don't be a buzzkill.

01:30.317 --> 01:32.250
You're wasted.
So?

01:32.317 --> 01:33.817
So...

01:33.884 --> 01:36.550
So I'm two shots behind.

01:36.617 --> 01:39.751
<i>( laughing ):
Well, let's get you some, baby!</i>

01:44.217 --> 01:47.283
<i>( chanting ):
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!</i>

01:47.350 --> 01:48.617
Drink! Drink! Drink!

01:48.684 --> 01:51.183
Whoo!

01:51.250 --> 01:52.283
Whoo!

02:21.717 --> 02:23.384
Frank.

02:23.450 --> 02:26.550
Horatio.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.617
What do you have, Frank?

02:28.684 --> 02:30.784
Abandoned car,
missing girl.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.350
Girl's name
is Sarah Jennings.

02:33.417 --> 02:34.951
What do we know about Sarah?

02:35.018 --> 02:36.183
Kid from Georgia.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.651
Just turned 18.

02:37.717 --> 02:39.617
Was here with her class
for a trip to the Bahamas.

02:39.684 --> 02:41.084
Boat was due to
leave this morning.

02:41.183 --> 02:42.317
She never made it.

02:42.384 --> 02:43.517
Her friend went
looking for her

02:43.584 --> 02:45.018
and found her car.

02:45.084 --> 02:46.183
That the friend?
Yeah.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.283
Name is, uh...

02:47.350 --> 02:48.617
Tina Saunders.

02:48.684 --> 02:51.884
She gave us a picture
of the missing girl.

02:53.717 --> 02:55.684
She's pretty.

02:55.751 --> 02:57.018
What about parents?

02:57.084 --> 02:58.350
We've been in touch.

02:58.417 --> 02:59.951
They're on their way to Miami
as we speak.

03:00.018 --> 03:01.484
We've also got blood

03:01.550 --> 03:02.550
on the inside
of the back window.

03:02.617 --> 03:03.917
I noticed that.
It's transfer.

03:03.984 --> 03:07.751
We also have a blood trail
leading away from the car.

03:07.817 --> 03:09.484
Vomit.

03:09.550 --> 03:12.350
Looks like things
took a wrong turn here.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.384
It's not looking
too good, Horatio.

03:14.450 --> 03:17.250
On the contrary.
There is a chance

03:17.317 --> 03:18.250
this girl is alive...

03:18.317 --> 03:22.317
and we are going to find her.

03:22.384 --> 03:25.884
* Yeah! *

03:45.283 --> 03:48.584
* We don't get fooled again *

03:48.651 --> 03:52.283
* Don't get fooled again *
* No, no. *

04:14.217 --> 04:15.550
You call in the cadaver dogs?

04:15.617 --> 04:17.084
Those are
rescue dogs, Eric.

04:17.151 --> 04:19.351
Officer.

04:21.684 --> 04:23.051
We get anything that belonged

04:23.117 --> 04:24.617
to the victim yet?
We're about to find out.

04:24.684 --> 04:27.418
I found something
in Sarah's hotel room.

04:27.483 --> 04:28.684
It's her favorite top.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.483
All right, look,
we get a hit on anything,

04:30.550 --> 04:32.051
I'll get ahold of you.
Appreciate it.

04:32.117 --> 04:33.418
So do you think that will help?

04:33.483 --> 04:34.483
It's going to help.

04:34.550 --> 04:35.951
You're a good friend.

04:36.017 --> 04:39.017
I should've never left her
at that club.

04:39.084 --> 04:41.117
You left the club
about 2:00 a.m.?

04:41.184 --> 04:42.750
Yeah, 2:00.

04:42.817 --> 04:44.951
I already told the detective.

04:45.017 --> 04:46.650
Well, timelines vary
in the excitement.

04:46.717 --> 04:47.917
No, I'm sure.

04:47.984 --> 04:49.984
When I took off,
Sarah was at the bar.

04:50.051 --> 04:52.017
Okay.
Thank you.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.017
CAINE:
Mr. Wolfe.

05:10.084 --> 05:11.450
Found an earring.

05:11.517 --> 05:13.117
Looks like the same kind
as we saw

05:13.184 --> 05:15.117
in the missing girl's photo.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.384
Means we might have her DNA.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.184
You get any prints?

05:18.251 --> 05:19.850
Couple of juicy latents inside.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.217
Check out the outside of the
driver's window.
I see that.

05:22.284 --> 05:23.483
That's a handprint.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.351
Somebody was watching her.

05:36.984 --> 05:38.717
In more ways than one.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.483
Pop that trunk, please.

05:52.784 --> 05:53.784
Hmm...

05:53.850 --> 05:55.217
Look at that.

05:55.284 --> 05:57.984
See, that receiver
right there, Mr. Wolfe,

05:58.051 --> 05:59.418
is attached
to that hidden camera

05:59.483 --> 06:00.917
in the rearview.

06:00.984 --> 06:02.917
A mobile spy camera?

06:02.984 --> 06:04.583
What do we know about this car?

06:04.650 --> 06:05.850
Two things--

06:05.917 --> 06:07.850
teenagers aren't usually
allowed to rent cars,

06:07.917 --> 06:10.084
and this one's registered
to Oceanward Travel.

06:10.151 --> 06:12.750
Okay, so you call them,
make a reservation,

06:12.817 --> 06:14.217
and I'll pay a visit.

06:21.717 --> 06:23.184
She's missing?

06:23.251 --> 06:26.318
And she was driving
one of your rental cars.

06:26.384 --> 06:28.583
You have to understand
our business.

06:28.650 --> 06:32.318
We provide students with
the ultimate travel experience.

06:32.384 --> 06:34.750
We take care of our kids,
but we never break the law.

06:34.817 --> 06:36.151
Valid license.

06:36.217 --> 06:38.550
Says she's 18.

06:38.617 --> 06:39.550
She was a minor

06:39.617 --> 06:42.117
who's disappeared on your watch.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.684
Ms. Jennings shouldn't
have even been out

06:43.750 --> 06:45.384
last night.
Why is that?

06:45.450 --> 06:47.951
The kids sign
a behavior contract
with our travel agency.

06:48.017 --> 06:49.684
And she was already
on probation

06:49.750 --> 06:52.351
for a curfew violation
from two nights ago.

06:52.418 --> 06:56.151
So you installed that camera
to ensure that she made curfew.

06:56.184 --> 06:58.017
Beg your pardon?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.351
There is a surveillance camera

07:00.418 --> 07:03.051
in the rearview mirror
of that car, Mr. Griffith.

07:03.117 --> 07:04.917
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

07:04.984 --> 07:06.450
Maybe picking up

07:06.517 --> 07:08.750
a little extra cash
selling underage sex tapes.

07:08.817 --> 07:10.917
You kidding me?

07:10.984 --> 07:12.084
Somebody installed the camera

07:12.151 --> 07:14.017
and the car is registered
to you.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.051
<i>( stammers ):
Oh... look,</i>

07:16.117 --> 07:17.583
I'll help you guys, okay?

07:17.650 --> 07:19.351
Any way I can.

07:19.418 --> 07:21.917
I'm sorry she's missing,
but I-I did not plant a camera

07:21.984 --> 07:23.750
and I had nothing to do
with her disappearance.

07:23.817 --> 07:25.750
Okay? Nothing.

07:29.787 --> 07:31.910
So what do you think
about the spy camera, Brayne?

07:32.511 --> 07:36.105
Well, the web camera on the mirror
transmitted the feet
to the laptop in the trunk,

07:36.105 --> 07:40.147
then transmitted the feed out
via wireless modem

07:51.450 --> 07:54.418
Can you determine who was
receiving the signal?

07:54.483 --> 07:56.483
I'm sorry,
I left that seminar
at the lunch break.

07:56.550 --> 07:57.717
But I paged the resident
computer geek,

07:57.784 --> 07:58.884
and he says
he's on his way.

07:58.951 --> 08:00.784
Do you have anything
you can show me?

08:00.850 --> 08:02.784
Let's see.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.217
Here's all the
video recovered

08:04.284 --> 08:05.483
from Sarah's rental car.

08:07.517 --> 08:10.251
Check it out, this
is from last night.

08:10.318 --> 08:11.784
Who's the guy?

08:11.850 --> 08:13.784
Whoever he is...

08:13.850 --> 08:15.384
<i>she is wasted.</i>

08:15.450 --> 08:16.650
What does that have
to do with anything?

08:16.717 --> 08:18.817
It's her car, it's her backseat,

08:18.884 --> 08:20.251
you throw in a
lot of booze...

08:20.318 --> 08:22.151
She put herself in a
compromising position.

08:22.217 --> 08:24.184
A woman always has the right
to say no.

08:25.217 --> 08:26.450
I know that.

08:26.517 --> 08:28.550
I'm just saying
she made herself a target.

08:28.617 --> 08:29.917
She was a teenager.

08:29.984 --> 08:31.483
And?

08:31.550 --> 08:32.917
You add alcohol,
hormones to the mix,

08:32.984 --> 08:34.817
you can get a pretty
out-of-control kid.

08:43.650 --> 08:44.684
Wow, he's pissed.

08:44.750 --> 08:48.517
They're in some
sort of an argument.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.017
One thing's clear--
we have to find him.

08:51.084 --> 08:52.517
Picture's grainy.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.450
Let's get a still
of the guy anyway.

09:03.550 --> 09:05.184
We checked you out, Brad.

09:05.251 --> 09:06.418
The bouncers at Liquid Neon

09:06.483 --> 09:08.284
say you're out clubbing
seven nights a week.

09:08.351 --> 09:09.284
So?

09:09.351 --> 09:10.917
I like to have a good time.

09:10.984 --> 09:14.151
The girl in this
picture's missing.

09:14.217 --> 09:16.051
Yeah.

09:16.117 --> 09:18.850
I heard about it
on the radio.

09:18.917 --> 09:19.917
Bummer.

09:19.984 --> 09:22.784
But we just made out in her car.

09:22.850 --> 09:24.617
No, I'm old enough.

09:30.717 --> 09:32.117
WOLFE:
So, uh...

09:32.184 --> 09:34.117
how do you explain all that
blood we found in the car?

09:34.184 --> 09:36.717
You tell me,
you're the detectives.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.418
Actually, we're CSIs.

09:38.483 --> 09:40.984
And we have a warrant
to collect your DNA.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.017
I could've saved you the time.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.550
The blood's mine.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.351
Chick elbowed me in the nose.

09:49.517 --> 09:51.650
Oh, my God, are you kidding?!

09:51.717 --> 09:52.817
And then you got mad

09:52.884 --> 09:54.284
and you dragged her
out of the car.

09:54.351 --> 09:56.318
Wasn't me, man.

09:56.384 --> 09:57.583
Who was it?

09:57.650 --> 09:58.750
Beats me.

09:58.817 --> 10:00.184
Some crazy stalker
guy shows up,

10:00.217 --> 10:02.517
starts screaming at her
to get out of the car.

10:02.583 --> 10:03.784
It was insane.

10:07.217 --> 10:09.184
MAN:
What are you
doing there?!

10:09.251 --> 10:10.351
Oh, no.
Ouch!

10:10.418 --> 10:13.184
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?!

10:13.251 --> 10:14.850
MAN:
Okay, guy, you
get out of here.

10:14.917 --> 10:16.450
Come on,
leave her alone.

10:19.284 --> 10:21.418
Right.
So did you get a good look

10:21.483 --> 10:23.251
at this "crazy stalker guy"?

10:23.318 --> 10:24.817
The chick almost
broke my nose.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.850
I couldn't deal.
I got out of there.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.483
That's the truth, straight up.

10:29.784 --> 10:32.084
We'll see just how
straight up it is.

10:32.151 --> 10:33.550
Put your hands
on the screen.

10:33.617 --> 10:34.984
We need your prints.

10:39.017 --> 10:40.217
Not like that.

10:40.284 --> 10:42.284
Like this.

10:55.483 --> 10:56.583
Prints not a match.

10:56.650 --> 10:58.684
Brad was telling the truth.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.583
At least about that.

11:00.650 --> 11:02.750
I'll have patrol
keep some eyes on him.

11:02.817 --> 11:04.884
In the meantime, we have
a possible stalker out there

11:04.951 --> 11:06.884
whose handprints match these.

11:06.951 --> 11:08.384
We better get on it.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.117
Horatio, you
got a minute?

11:10.184 --> 11:11.850
Is it regarding
Sarah Jennings?
No.

11:11.917 --> 11:13.517
Sorry, but it's going
to have to wait.

11:13.583 --> 11:15.151
I think you're gonna
want to hear about this.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.784
File appeared on my desk,
old murder case,

11:16.850 --> 11:18.151
except the file's
different than ours

11:18.217 --> 11:19.984
and the numbers don't match
anything in our system.

11:20.051 --> 11:21.151
How does it
relate to me?

11:21.217 --> 11:23.517
You're listed as the
arresting officer.

11:26.717 --> 11:27.884
What are
the first two numbers

11:27.951 --> 11:29.151
on that case file,
please?

11:29.217 --> 11:32.084
Uh... 95.

11:32.117 --> 11:33.917
Okay.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.850
I want you to do me a favor
and lay that on my desk

11:36.917 --> 11:38.418
and I will take care of it.

11:38.483 --> 11:40.684
Okay. Whatever you say.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.583
Thank you, ma'am.

11:46.384 --> 11:48.084
Yeah, Jennifer.

11:48.151 --> 11:49.917
Yes, Horatio Caine.

11:49.984 --> 11:51.917
Well, um...

11:51.984 --> 11:54.650
that day that we
talked about has arrived.

11:54.717 --> 11:56.051
What I want you to do

11:56.117 --> 11:58.151
is just stay in the house
until you hear from me.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.318
Oka... I understand.

12:00.384 --> 12:01.583
Just wait for my call.

12:01.650 --> 12:03.450
Officer Jessop.

12:03.517 --> 12:04.784
Yes, Lieutenant.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.351
How would you like
to make some overtime?

12:07.418 --> 12:08.617
Sure.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.850
There's a young lady I know

12:09.917 --> 12:11.483
and her life may be in danger.

12:11.550 --> 12:12.717
Witness or victim?

12:12.784 --> 12:14.251
She's both.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.550
What's her name?
Her name is
Jennifer Wilson.

12:15.617 --> 12:17.217
She lives at 720 Bayside Road.

12:17.284 --> 12:19.684
You see or hear anything,
you let me know.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.617
You can count
on me, sir.
Good.

12:21.684 --> 12:23.284
PAULA:
Lieutenant.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.917
Sir, I've just heard
over the radio there's

12:24.984 --> 12:26.184
some action
down at the beach,

12:26.217 --> 12:27.850
near Liquid Neon.

12:27.917 --> 12:28.984
It's about your missing girl.

12:29.051 --> 12:30.717
I'm on my way.

12:45.684 --> 12:47.418
CAINE:
Eric.

12:47.483 --> 12:49.051
Did you get something?

12:51.217 --> 12:53.084
We had the dogs
working her scent.

12:53.151 --> 12:55.017
Canvassed the entire
neighborhood and found this.

12:55.084 --> 12:56.084
It's an I.D.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.351
It's Sarah's.

12:57.418 --> 12:58.650
She's still alive.

12:58.717 --> 12:59.984
Why do you say that?

13:00.051 --> 13:02.384
Woman jogging said
she saw a girl matching

13:02.450 --> 13:03.784
Sarah's description
drop the purse.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.184
She said the girl looked
agitated, disoriented.

13:06.251 --> 13:07.184
How long ago?

13:07.251 --> 13:08.850
Not even
half an hour.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.550
She's out there.

13:11.617 --> 13:13.917
Yeah, but in which direction?

13:44.101 --> 13:45.368
H.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.368
Yeah.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.734
Did you get something?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.467
Yeah.

13:49.533 --> 13:53.298
Yeah, the stain
on the outside of the purse
I don't know what it is--
I'll get it to Trace--

13:53.298 --> 13:55.838
But I found this pill inside the pocket.

13:56.301 --> 13:57.934
It's stamped. It's Adderine.

13:58.001 --> 13:59.034
Pharmaceutical grade.

13:59.134 --> 14:00.934
Attention deficit disorder?

14:01.001 --> 14:02.867
Her medical history
didn't say anything about ADD

14:02.934 --> 14:04.767
so no doctor gave her this drug.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.101
You're exactly right,
but you know what, Eric?

14:07.167 --> 14:09.001
I know who did.

14:14.533 --> 14:15.867
A drug dealer?

14:15.934 --> 14:17.533
Okay, now you're
just insulting me.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.634
Adderine, Mr. Griffith,
is an amphetamine

14:20.667 --> 14:22.301
and a prescription drug.

14:22.368 --> 14:24.500
Getting kids high part
of the "ultimate experience"

14:24.567 --> 14:26.067
you were talking about?

14:27.368 --> 14:28.800
Help us out here, Griffith,
she could

14:28.867 --> 14:30.433
still be alive.
Help us out here.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.334
CAINE:
Here's what I'm going
to do, Mr. Griffith.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.600
I'm going
to speak to some

14:33.667 --> 14:35.268
of Sarah's friends
and see what else

14:35.334 --> 14:37.400
you put in those
vacation packages.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.268
Tourism is cutthroat.

14:40.368 --> 14:41.934
All right? We needed an edge,

14:42.001 --> 14:43.234
so I-I sold her a
little pick-me-up.

14:43.301 --> 14:46.234
If we find her dead,
that's going to be on you.
Hey, I can't help it

14:47.467 --> 14:49.001
if the kid had vices.
Frank,

14:49.067 --> 14:50.268
why don't you start the process

14:50.334 --> 14:51.301
on Mr. Griffith,

14:51.368 --> 14:52.800
please.

14:52.867 --> 14:54.234
GRIFFITH:
Hannah, get ahold of my wife.

14:54.301 --> 14:55.467
Give her the keys to the agency.

14:55.567 --> 14:56.700
Tell her to lock up.

14:56.767 --> 14:57.767
I'll get ahold of her
when all this

14:57.867 --> 14:58.967
gets straightened out.

14:59.034 --> 15:00.334
Right away,
Mr. Griffith.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.600
Hang on a second.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.067
You were at the beach this
morning, ma'am, weren't you?

15:12.067 --> 15:13.767
No.

15:13.834 --> 15:15.268
Oh, yes, you were.

15:15.334 --> 15:16.934
Those needles around your feet

15:17.001 --> 15:21.500
are from bottle brush trees
where you hid Sarah's purse.

15:21.567 --> 15:22.667
Right?

15:27.500 --> 15:28.734
Ted made me do it.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.834
He said to make sure
there was a witness.

15:30.901 --> 15:32.334
I asked her, all right?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
I found it at the club,
and then she disappears.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.500
<i>How's that make me look?</i>

15:35.600 --> 15:36.734
It makes you look guilty.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.734
Here's the good news.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.567
Now you have company.

15:41.634 --> 15:43.400
Stand up, ma'am.

15:43.467 --> 15:46.433
Let's go.

15:52.301 --> 15:53.800
Hey.
Hey.

15:53.867 --> 15:55.700
Horatio says you
were running Trace
on the purse.

15:55.734 --> 15:57.634
Yeah, the stain
on the outside is

15:57.700 --> 15:59.901
a mixture of ethanol,
rose oil and honey.

16:02.567 --> 16:03.500
It's rose-honey vodka.

16:03.567 --> 16:04.700
It's a floral alcohol.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.667
It's a new
thing in clubs.

16:06.734 --> 16:07.700
They call it Red Bayou.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.700
I've never heard of it.

16:08.767 --> 16:09.901
That's because
Red Bayou

16:09.934 --> 16:11.533
doesn't go in stores
until next month.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.201
Guess where the company's
test marketing it?

16:14.268 --> 16:16.433
Liquid Neon.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.967
The club where Sarah
was last seen.

16:22.268 --> 16:23.834
Miss Nordoff,
I understand you're

16:23.901 --> 16:26.634
the sales rep for Red Bayou
in the southern states.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.934
That's correct.

16:29.301 --> 16:30.734
Sarah Jennings is missing.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.234
The club owner said you were
with her for most of the night.

16:33.301 --> 16:37.201
It's my job to make sure someone
like Sarah is into our drink.

16:37.234 --> 16:38.600
Someone like Sarah?

16:38.667 --> 16:41.901
Young, friendly, hot.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.400
She was like
a walking billboard.

16:48.967 --> 16:52.034
Oh! Oh, my God,
I amso sorry.

16:52.101 --> 16:53.101
That's okay.

16:54.234 --> 16:55.467
Go for it.
It's all you, girl.

16:55.533 --> 16:57.634
Okay. Here goes!

17:01.533 --> 17:04.034
Viral marketing,
that's your tactic.

17:04.101 --> 17:05.400
I hate that term.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.233
I create trends.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.934
You used Sarah.

17:09.001 --> 17:10.934
I supplied a service.

17:11.001 --> 17:13.901
Regardless. Your new
beverage is about to get

17:13.934 --> 17:15.334
some very bad publicity.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.233
It would be to your
benefit to tell us

17:17.300 --> 17:19.268
everything you remember
about Sarah from last night.

17:19.334 --> 17:21.567
I told you-- she was popular.

17:21.634 --> 17:23.334
Guys were all over her.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.666
One said he wanted
to take her out on his boat.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.433
Do you remember his name?

17:28.500 --> 17:29.533
Oh, man.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.934
There's so many.

17:32.001 --> 17:33.368
Something Marshall.

17:34.301 --> 17:35.934
Said he sailed out of...

17:36.001 --> 17:37.800
Cutler Bay Marina.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.467
I need you to write
down the names of any guys

17:42.533 --> 17:45.067
you might remember
from last night.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.500
Horatio?

17:49.567 --> 17:51.201
I may have something.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.678
The dock master said there was a boat
registered to Jeff Marshall

17:58.678 --> 17:59.632
in subrange 28

17:59.867 --> 18:00.800
So where's Jeff?

18:00.867 --> 18:03.301
I don't know.

18:03.368 --> 18:05.901
Jeff Marshall!

18:05.967 --> 18:07.667
You in there?

18:07.734 --> 18:09.067
Serious, dude,
let me grab a couple things

18:09.134 --> 18:10.067
and I'll meet you...

18:10.134 --> 18:11.634
Horatio.
Yeah.

18:11.700 --> 18:12.667
Take a look.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.600
I, uh,
gotta call you back.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.001
Hey, Jeff?

18:18.067 --> 18:20.301
TRIPP:
Miami Dade Police!

18:20.368 --> 18:22.500
Jeff, why don't
you join us?

18:22.533 --> 18:24.001
Come on.

18:28.334 --> 18:29.400
Yeah, I'm Jeff Marshall.

18:30.867 --> 18:32.533
TRIPP:
Looked like you were
about to bust out

18:32.567 --> 18:33.567
in a 40-yard dash.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.134
I have a problem
with authority.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.201
You also have
a problem

18:36.268 --> 18:37.201
with Sarah Jennings.

18:37.268 --> 18:38.201
Who?

18:38.268 --> 18:39.268
Sarah Jennings is the lady

18:39.334 --> 18:40.500
you had here last night.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.067
There were a bunch
of girls here last night.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.400
How do you explain this, Jeff?

18:45.467 --> 18:47.368
TRIPP:
Deja vu.

18:47.433 --> 18:48.901
More vomit.

18:48.934 --> 18:50.800
You trying to
hide something, sport?

18:50.867 --> 18:52.034
It's mine.
It happened last week.

18:52.101 --> 18:53.634
Bad shellfish.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.500
TRIPP:
You been wearing those jeans
all week, too?

18:57.433 --> 18:58.934
I want some answers, right now.

19:00.234 --> 19:01.700
I want my lawyer.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.433
You can contact your lawyer
on the way downtown.

19:07.467 --> 19:08.834
MAN:
They said I would
find you here.

19:08.901 --> 19:10.301
Where's my daughter?!

19:10.368 --> 19:11.767
What'd you
do with her?
Take it easy. Mr. Jennings.

19:11.834 --> 19:13.500
you can't be here right now.
It's all
over the news!

19:13.600 --> 19:15.400
Is this the guy?
Is this him?
That's the guy.

19:15.467 --> 19:17.167
I'll kill you myself, you
understand? With my bare hands!

19:17.234 --> 19:18.533
Mr. Jennings, listen to me.

19:18.634 --> 19:20.567
Now, I want to find Sarah
as much as you do,

19:20.667 --> 19:22.234
but I need your help.

19:22.301 --> 19:23.600
Where are you staying?
At the
Stonemoor Hotel.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.734
My wife and I are setting
up a command post.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.134
Go back to your hotel
and wait for my call.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.201
I'll take care
of this, all right?

19:31.268 --> 19:32.834
All right.
Okay?

19:32.901 --> 19:35.201
Okay.
Fine, go ahead
and do that.

19:35.268 --> 19:36.467
I'll call you.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.834
Go ahead.

19:50.268 --> 19:52.034
Mr. Marshall?

19:52.101 --> 19:54.667
I can prove that Sarah Jennings

19:54.700 --> 19:55.901
was on your boat this morning.

19:55.967 --> 19:58.201
Don't say
anything, Jeff.

19:58.268 --> 19:59.600
Where is she?

19:59.667 --> 20:00.734
To say anything,
Lieutenant,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.167
would suggest
consciousness of guilt.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.834
Gentlemen,

20:03.901 --> 20:06.134
a young lady might be out there
struggling for her life.

20:06.201 --> 20:07.500
Every seconds counts.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.934
Come on, all you have
is a girl who drank too much.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.001
Throw a rock on Collins,
you'll find dozens more.

20:12.101 --> 20:14.034
Mmm. Where is she?

20:15.500 --> 20:16.567
Where is she, Jeff?

20:21.234 --> 20:25.767
Look... when Sarah and her
friend, Tina, left my boat,

20:25.834 --> 20:26.767
they were fine.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.433
What time was that?

20:28.500 --> 20:29.700
Around 5:00 this morning.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.734
What happened after that,
I have no idea.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.700
Mm. That's a start.

20:33.767 --> 20:35.567
Have you seen my friend?

20:35.634 --> 20:37.368
H-have you seen my friend?

20:37.433 --> 20:38.734
Have you seen my friend?

20:38.800 --> 20:41.700
Have you?

20:41.734 --> 20:43.301
You lied to me.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.500
Lie?

20:44.567 --> 20:46.134
You told me
you left Sarah

20:46.201 --> 20:47.967
at the club
at 2:00 a.m.

20:48.001 --> 20:49.101
Yeah.

20:49.134 --> 20:50.634
Yeah, well,
Jeff Marshall says

20:50.734 --> 20:52.934
you were on his boat
with her until 5:00 a.m.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.600
Is that true?

20:55.667 --> 20:58.533
We totally broke
the behavior contract--

20:58.600 --> 21:01.600
drinking, popping pills,
hanging with those guys.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.533
Look...

21:03.600 --> 21:06.001
I was afraid they wouldn't
let me go on the Bahamas trip.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.400
Where'd you go
after the boat?

21:07.467 --> 21:08.734
I don't know. I don't remember.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.001
Tina.
Really. I
was so drunk.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.767
I passed out somewhere.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.600
When I woke up, Sarah was gone.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.034
I tried to look for her.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.967
Sarah! Sarah, whereare you?!

21:21.034 --> 21:23.734
I knew I couldn't call you guys
till my buzz wore off.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.368
Well, that cost us
a lot of time.

21:25.433 --> 21:26.533
And maybe
Sarah's life.
Don't you think I know that?

21:28.567 --> 21:30.067
We need your help,
Tina, right now.

21:30.101 --> 21:31.667
How?

22:15.634 --> 22:16.767
What is that?

22:16.834 --> 22:18.634
Cursory view. Sand.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.134
Do you think
we were at the beach?

22:20.201 --> 22:21.600
No. Beach sand is white.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.834
It's crushed coral.
This is darker.

22:23.901 --> 22:25.734
This is from a sand trap...

22:25.800 --> 22:26.934
maybe.

22:27.001 --> 22:29.500
Closest golf course
is miles away.

22:29.567 --> 22:32.800
But there's a kids'
playground in the area.

23:00.734 --> 23:05.001
This is like the best trip ever.

23:05.067 --> 23:07.467
Bahamas, baby!

23:17.767 --> 23:19.634
DELKO:
H.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.734
Horatio.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.301
Yeah! You got something?

23:54.500 --> 23:57.334
That's a...

23:59.067 --> 24:02.201
Her hair and her clothing
is damp.

24:02.267 --> 24:05.201
The grass around her is dry.

24:05.267 --> 24:08.468
The body is fresh.

24:08.533 --> 24:12.334
Take a look at the buttons
on her blouse.

24:14.334 --> 24:15.834
Could be a redress.

24:15.900 --> 24:20.434
Give me a minute, will you?

24:20.500 --> 24:21.834
Yeah.

24:40.900 --> 24:44.500
Sarah...

24:44.567 --> 24:47.134
I'm so sorry.

25:00.518 --> 25:01.784
Alexx, please tell me

25:01.850 --> 25:03.884
you haven't started the post
on Sarah Jennings.

25:03.950 --> 25:06.351
Oh, she just
arrived, honey.

25:06.418 --> 25:08.484
<i>Not even I
work that fast.</i>

25:08.518 --> 25:09.817
Oh, good, then
I'm not too late.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.117
Too late for what?

25:11.184 --> 25:13.251
To tag our girl for
special processing.

25:13.317 --> 25:14.683
Special processing?

25:14.750 --> 25:16.750
You don't want me
to open her up?

25:16.850 --> 25:17.984
Not yet.

25:18.051 --> 25:19.784
Eric said that
Sarah's body was wet.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.451
She was.
That doesn't
make very sense.

25:21.550 --> 25:23.051
We found her on dry land,

25:23.117 --> 25:24.550
and it hasn't rained
in 24 hours.

25:24.617 --> 25:27.817
So you want to preserve
any possible evidence

25:27.884 --> 25:28.950
until you process her.

25:29.017 --> 25:30.384
Exactly.
It might be the only way

25:30.451 --> 25:31.817
we find out
what happened to her.

25:31.884 --> 25:35.950
Well, if it helps,
at first blush,

25:35.984 --> 25:37.683
she's got petechiae.

25:38.717 --> 25:41.217
Bruising around the throat,

25:41.284 --> 25:43.817
and her tongue is blue.

25:43.884 --> 25:45.151
So, she was strangled.

25:45.217 --> 25:46.650
With sustained pressure.

25:46.717 --> 25:48.217
Did you notice her blouse?

25:48.284 --> 25:49.583
One of the buttons is off.

25:49.650 --> 25:50.683
We're thinking redress.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.351
I'll run a sexual assault kit.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.351
Buttons are flat.

26:35.384 --> 26:36.984
They've got a good workable
print surface.

26:37.051 --> 26:39.051
I'm going to run them to Joseph.

26:40.284 --> 26:42.184
Hey, Alexx,
what is it?

26:42.284 --> 26:43.184
I'm not sure.

26:43.251 --> 26:45.884
UV's picking up
something.

26:45.950 --> 26:47.617
Actually, it's a lot
of something.

26:47.683 --> 26:48.683
Take a look.

26:50.350 --> 26:51.884
DUQUESNE:
Whatever it is,

26:51.983 --> 26:54.417
it's all over her
clothes and her body.

26:54.484 --> 26:56.918
I'm almost afraid
to find out what it is.

26:57.017 --> 26:59.884
I'm going to take her
clothes to Trace.

26:59.950 --> 27:02.117
I'll finish
the sexual assault kit.

27:02.217 --> 27:04.918
Baby girl's trying
to tell us something.

27:07.651 --> 27:09.751
So, Dan, did you get anything

27:09.818 --> 27:11.751
from that camera
in Sarah's rental car?

27:11.818 --> 27:13.451
I think so.
Check it out.

27:13.517 --> 27:14.983
The image went
to the laptop,

27:14.983 --> 27:17.017
then out over a
wireless phone line.

27:17.083 --> 27:18.617
Thanks. But even I knew that.

27:18.684 --> 27:20.217
Here's something
you didn't know.

27:20.317 --> 27:23.651
The image was sent
to a central server in Georgia.

27:23.717 --> 27:24.717
Georgia?

27:24.784 --> 27:25.950
Our vic's from Georgia.

27:26.017 --> 27:27.551
That can't be a coincidence.

27:27.617 --> 27:29.818
Her whole
class is.

27:29.884 --> 27:31.517
Anyone with Internet access
and a password

27:31.584 --> 27:32.784
could access that video feed.

27:50.384 --> 27:52.751
So how do we find our voyeur?

27:52.818 --> 27:55.217
I tracked the
I.P. address.

27:55.284 --> 27:57.017
I wonder how
many students

27:57.083 --> 27:58.950
brought their
laptops down.

27:59.017 --> 28:01.818
And it is registered

28:01.918 --> 28:04.651
to the Stonemoor Hotel
here in Miami.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.617
Room 503, to be exact.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.484
You sure it's room 503?

28:08.551 --> 28:10.017
Yeah. Why?

28:10.117 --> 28:12.417
That's Sarah's parents' room.

28:18.584 --> 28:20.651
Have you found the person
who did this to my daughter?

28:20.717 --> 28:22.818
The search is ongoing.

28:22.884 --> 28:24.983
Then why are we here?

28:25.050 --> 28:27.484
Why is my husband
being questioned?

28:27.551 --> 28:31.950
Okay, we traced
a hidden camera

28:32.017 --> 28:33.517
from your daughter's
rental car

28:33.584 --> 28:35.384
back to your
hotel room.

28:35.451 --> 28:37.751
Sarah was being monitored.

28:37.818 --> 28:40.050
Monitored? What do you mean?

28:40.117 --> 28:42.651
It was not by us.
We just flew in this morning.

28:42.717 --> 28:44.417
Did you fly together?

28:44.484 --> 28:46.451
Well, no. Paul came in
from Houston.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.250
He was there on business.

28:53.584 --> 28:55.584
How would you describe

28:55.651 --> 28:59.217
your husband's
relationship with Sarah?

28:59.317 --> 29:02.983
I... Well, he's wonderful.

29:03.050 --> 29:05.417
Sarah was just a baby
when we married,

29:05.517 --> 29:08.083
but he always treated her
like his own.

29:08.150 --> 29:11.517
Did you ever suspect

29:11.584 --> 29:14.751
anything else going
on between them?

29:14.784 --> 29:17.517
What are you insinuating?

29:17.584 --> 29:20.950
You think my husband
was involved in this?

29:22.950 --> 29:24.417
That's impossible.

29:24.484 --> 29:28.250
Actually, he lied to
you, Mrs. Jennings.

29:28.317 --> 29:31.083
Your husband has been
at the Stonemoor Hotel

29:31.150 --> 29:33.751
for several days now.

29:38.150 --> 29:40.083
You don't know
what you're talking about.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.818
You installed
a surveillance camera

29:41.884 --> 29:44.617
in your daughter's rental car
so you could spy on her.

29:52.317 --> 29:54.150
You say spy.

29:54.217 --> 29:55.484
I say protect.

29:55.551 --> 29:56.651
From a distance.

29:56.717 --> 29:58.217
She never knew I was watching.

29:58.284 --> 30:02.150
<i>That is not true either.</i>

30:02.217 --> 30:04.617
What's that?

30:04.684 --> 30:07.217
That is a palm print taken from
the window of that rental car.

30:07.284 --> 30:08.884
Is it going to match to you.

30:08.918 --> 30:12.250
You were stalking her,
weren't you?

30:20.217 --> 30:22.217
SARAH:
Oh, no.

30:22.284 --> 30:24.551
I was looking out
for my daughter.

30:24.584 --> 30:26.517
Stepdaughter, you mean?

30:30.451 --> 30:33.083
Her mother always thought
I was being overprotective,

30:33.150 --> 30:35.617
but, uh, she
doesn't get it.

30:35.684 --> 30:37.918
She doesn't know
how guys can be.

30:37.983 --> 30:39.517
When I saw Sarah
get in the backseat

30:39.584 --> 30:42.184
with that little... creep,

30:42.250 --> 30:45.317
I sped over to the parking lot.

30:45.384 --> 30:47.751
Come on, honey.
What are you doing?

30:47.818 --> 30:49.117
What are you
trying to do?

30:49.184 --> 30:51.651
Oh, my God!
You're out
of control.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.217
I'm 18 now.
Get over it!

30:53.250 --> 30:54.918
You are flying home
with me tonight.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.184
You can't tell me
what to do!

30:56.217 --> 30:57.484
You're not even
my real father!

30:57.551 --> 30:58.884
Sarah!

30:59.851 --> 31:01.250
I've raised that girl

31:01.250 --> 31:03.184
since she was two years old.

31:05.284 --> 31:07.050
I would never hurt Sarah.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.617
Then you, uh...

31:08.684 --> 31:12.884
you won't mind giving me
a DNA sample, right?

31:17.117 --> 31:18.918
Hey.

31:18.983 --> 31:21.317
The sexual assault kit
from Sarah Jennings?

31:21.384 --> 31:23.751
Sarah definitely
had intercourse.

31:23.818 --> 31:25.684
But I was only able
to get one sperm head

31:25.751 --> 31:26.884
from the vaginal sample.

31:26.950 --> 31:29.050
One? How is that possible?
Aren't there

31:29.117 --> 31:30.651
usually millions?

31:30.717 --> 31:34.083
Pre-ejeculate, faulty condom,
or he could have cleaned her up.

31:34.150 --> 31:35.884
Can you test just one?

31:35.950 --> 31:39.217
It's tricky. I'm supposed
to save half for the defense.

31:39.284 --> 31:40.451
In case their lab wants

31:40.517 --> 31:42.751
to independently confirm
our lab's results.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.250
And that's the problem.

31:44.350 --> 31:47.117
The sample's so small,
it'll be consumed in analysis.

31:47.184 --> 31:48.751
<i>There won't be another half.</i>

31:48.818 --> 31:51.150
If we get a result,
there'll be dual discovery.

31:51.217 --> 31:53.584
It's still a gamble.
And to be honest?

31:53.651 --> 31:57.083
My job's not exactly
on solid ground right now.

31:57.117 --> 32:00.117
Blame me.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.551
I'll authorize it.

32:01.617 --> 32:02.884
Without the DNA,

32:02.918 --> 32:04.217
there won't be a defendant.

32:04.284 --> 32:06.284
Okay.

32:33.451 --> 32:37.217
<i>beeping</i>

32:37.284 --> 32:38.284
DUQUESNE:
What do you know?

32:38.350 --> 32:39.451
Not a match to any

32:39.517 --> 32:41.017
of our male suspects.

32:41.083 --> 32:42.517
Who is that guy?

32:42.584 --> 32:46.117
Thomas Woodward.

32:46.184 --> 32:48.250
Do you know him?

32:48.284 --> 32:50.983
No. I got a list
of clubgoers

32:51.050 --> 32:52.584
from the viral
marketing girl.

32:52.651 --> 32:55.818
Homicide was
about to bring him
in for questioning.

32:55.884 --> 32:58.551
If this is about the statutory
rape charge a year ago,

32:58.617 --> 33:00.284
that was dismissed.

33:00.350 --> 33:03.751
This one won't be dismissed.

33:03.818 --> 33:05.250
You murdered Sarah Jennings,
didn't you?

33:05.317 --> 33:07.417
Murder?

33:07.484 --> 33:09.184
Yes, I can prove
that you had sex with her.

33:09.250 --> 33:10.884
Yeah, I did.

33:10.983 --> 33:13.517
We hooked up and had sex
on a friend's boat.

33:13.584 --> 33:15.784
Consensual sex.

33:15.851 --> 33:18.417
<i>You know how it is;
tourist girls.</i>

33:18.484 --> 33:21.551
<i>They come to Miami
and anything goes.</i>

33:21.617 --> 33:24.184
We were having a good time
until my friend showed up.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.083
"Friend" as in Jeff Marshall.

33:29.651 --> 33:32.317
What are you doing?!
I saw her first!

33:32.384 --> 33:33.784
She was mine!

33:35.584 --> 33:38.150
I've never seen Jeff so pissed.

33:38.217 --> 33:41.584
He's got a temper,
so I just left.

33:41.651 --> 33:44.017
How admirable.
You just left her there.

33:44.017 --> 33:46.017
Thought she was safe.

33:46.083 --> 33:50.584
He was mad at me, not her.

33:50.584 --> 33:52.584
I guess I thought wrong.

33:54.250 --> 33:55.617
Thomas said what?

33:55.684 --> 33:56.983
That you did it.

33:57.017 --> 33:58.083
You killed
Sarah Jennings.

33:58.184 --> 33:59.217
That's a total lie!

33:59.250 --> 34:00.484
Jeff...

34:00.551 --> 34:02.017
Were you jealous

34:02.083 --> 34:03.317
that she picked Thomas over you?

34:03.384 --> 34:05.083
Maybe you strangled her
out of rage.

34:05.150 --> 34:07.083
He's the one that picked her.

34:07.150 --> 34:09.050
He chose her outside the club.

34:09.150 --> 34:11.818
God, look at you!
You're out of control!

34:11.884 --> 34:14.551
Check out
this sweet little thing.

34:14.617 --> 34:17.417
One of the milk states?
Michigan, Wisconsin?

34:17.484 --> 34:19.317
Stop it!
Stop it!

34:19.384 --> 34:20.784
You can't tell me
what to do!

34:20.851 --> 34:22.083
You're not even
my real father!

34:23.684 --> 34:25.184
Sarah!

34:25.217 --> 34:26.217
She's got daddy issues.

34:26.284 --> 34:28.250
Talk about an easy target.

34:32.884 --> 34:34.784
We partied with Sarah
and her friend

34:34.818 --> 34:36.818
in Liquid Neon until 4:00,

34:36.884 --> 34:39.150
then took it
to my boat.

34:39.217 --> 34:41.818
Before we could get anywhere,
Sarah did an Exorcist.

34:45.717 --> 34:46.617
Whoa!
Oh!

34:46.617 --> 34:49.284
Nasty. Okay,
that's it.

34:49.350 --> 34:51.117
Hey, dial it back, man.

34:51.184 --> 34:53.983
It's the price you pay
for tapping tourists.

34:54.016 --> 34:55.250
No, party's over.

34:55.317 --> 34:56.451
Maybe for you.

34:56.516 --> 34:57.983
That one's too sweet
to throw back.

34:58.050 --> 35:00.384
<i>Thomas went after them.</i>

35:00.451 --> 35:02.184
He was with them last.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.551
I never touched her.

35:03.651 --> 35:05.551
Really?

35:05.584 --> 35:08.551
How do you explain
that we lifted your fingerprint

35:08.617 --> 35:10.417
off the button of her blouse?

35:20.617 --> 35:24.584
It matches
your ten card.

35:24.617 --> 35:25.784
Don't say
another word, Jeff.

35:25.851 --> 35:27.384
He doesn't have to.

35:27.451 --> 35:29.083
A jury will hear
how he redressed Sarah
to cover his tracks.

35:30.751 --> 35:33.050
No, they won't.
It won't make it to jury.
Judge will kick at prelim.

35:33.117 --> 35:34.451
Not if I can help it.

35:41.818 --> 35:43.017
DUQUESNE:
We're at a standstill.

35:43.050 --> 35:44.684
Jeff Marshall lays it all
on Thomas.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.950
HORATIO:
Thomas lays it
off on Jeff.

35:47.017 --> 35:48.884
He said-he said.

35:48.983 --> 35:50.684
Well, one of them did it.

35:50.717 --> 35:52.983
I'm going to go back
to the crime scene.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.784
If there's an answer waiting,
it'll be there

35:54.851 --> 35:56.117
Okay, thank you.

35:56.184 --> 35:58.284
Horatio, you and
I need to have
a conversation.

35:58.350 --> 36:00.250
Now is not
a good time, Rick.

36:00.317 --> 36:02.551
Jennifer Wilson--
does the name
ring a bell?

36:06.684 --> 36:08.017
That's none of your business.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.851
Well, see, you made it
my business

36:09.918 --> 36:11.451
when you sent a patrol officer
to sit on her house.

36:11.517 --> 36:16.776
You got no right authorizing
overtime for a case
that originated out
of our jurisdiction.

36:16.776 --> 36:20.950
Wilson is a citizen in Miami
and may be in grave danger.

36:21.017 --> 36:23.284
Yes, I know. I've familiarized
myself with the case.

36:23.350 --> 36:25.284
Then you know the story
of a nine-year-old girl

36:25.350 --> 36:27.651
who lost her parents
to a killer, don't you?

36:27.717 --> 36:30.417
Ten years ago. New York, right?

36:31.918 --> 36:33.784
You're still trying
to protect her.

36:33.884 --> 36:36.083
That's the job.

36:36.117 --> 36:38.350
Never caught the killer, right?

36:40.217 --> 36:42.384
My heart goes out
to her,

36:42.451 --> 36:44.017
but the taxpayers
aren't responsible

36:44.117 --> 36:45.983
for covering the cost
of Horatio Caine's hunches.

36:46.050 --> 36:49.350
Put it on my tab, okay?

36:49.417 --> 36:53.050
Sounds like you been paying
that tab for a long time.

37:27.918 --> 37:29.884
There's no evidence
of the killer.

37:29.951 --> 37:33.018
We sure this is where
the murder took place?

37:33.083 --> 37:36.384
No drag marks,
lividity's consistent.

37:36.450 --> 37:39.183
We'll just have
to trust the Locard's Principle.

37:39.250 --> 37:42.851
I know. Something taken,
something left behind.

37:42.918 --> 37:44.984
The answer's are here.

37:45.050 --> 37:46.350
We just don't see 'em yet.

37:46.384 --> 37:47.384
Yeah.

37:53.684 --> 37:55.350
Now we do.

39:18.984 --> 39:24.284
HORATIO:
Gentlemen, I thought it was time
we had a little chat together.

39:24.384 --> 39:26.551
Where's your lawyer, Jeff?

39:26.617 --> 39:27.918
I fired him

39:27.984 --> 39:29.417
for not letting
me talk.

39:29.517 --> 39:31.617
Well, now you're going
to get your chance.

39:31.684 --> 39:32.951
The Medical Examiner

39:33.018 --> 39:35.551
has confirmed
that Sarah was strangled

39:35.617 --> 39:38.417
between 5:00 a.m.
and 7:00 a.m. this morning.

39:38.484 --> 39:39.918
After which

39:39.984 --> 39:41.884
you redressed her, Jeff.

39:44.217 --> 39:46.751
I walked up
on this girl in the park...

39:46.817 --> 39:48.784
dead.

39:48.851 --> 39:51.684
Her body showing.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.617
What was I supposed to do,
just leave her like that?

40:03.684 --> 40:06.317
Dude, they got your prints.
Cop a plea.

40:06.384 --> 40:08.083
I didn't kill her.

40:08.150 --> 40:10.417
No, you didn't. Thomas did.

40:10.484 --> 40:11.450
Didn't you, Thomas?

40:11.517 --> 40:13.751
What? Me?

40:13.817 --> 40:15.250
I wasn't anywhere near
that park this morning.

40:15.317 --> 40:16.284
Oh, yes, you were.

40:16.350 --> 40:17.617
Thomas, you were there.

40:17.684 --> 40:19.617
The sprinkler system
in that park goes off

40:19.684 --> 40:22.984
automatically at 4:00 p.m.

40:23.050 --> 40:24.984
and at 6:00 a.m. every day.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.117
So?

40:38.183 --> 40:39.984
The water in the park
is reclaimed.

40:40.050 --> 40:41.384
And there is only
one source

40:41.450 --> 40:42.617
that feeds the park.

40:42.684 --> 40:46.050
It's from the Miami Shores
Reservoir.

40:46.150 --> 40:47.851
DUQUESNE:
The mixture's as unique
as a fingerprint.

40:47.918 --> 40:49.717
The water's infused

40:49.784 --> 40:52.217
with a chemical dye--
Rhodamine "B."

40:52.284 --> 40:54.684
You had that exact mixture
on your shirt

40:54.751 --> 40:56.784
<i>so you were there, Thomas.</i>

41:05.284 --> 41:09.018
Okay, I had sex at the park.

41:09.083 --> 41:10.984
That's how the water
got on my back.

41:11.050 --> 41:13.317
Doesn't mean
I killed her.

41:13.384 --> 41:16.417
DUQUESNE:
We actually have a way
to verify that.

41:16.484 --> 41:17.918
Show me your hands, please.

41:19.651 --> 41:24.350
Dye in the water reacts
to ultraviolet light.

41:24.417 --> 41:26.050
Sarah had digit
imprints on her neck.

41:30.450 --> 41:32.717
Water places you
at the scene.

41:34.884 --> 41:37.217
Evidence puts your
hands on her throat.

41:37.284 --> 41:38.584
You're crazy.

41:38.617 --> 41:39.918
You're guilty.

41:39.984 --> 41:41.551
Get off of me!
Shut up.

41:41.651 --> 41:42.717
I said shut up.

41:42.784 --> 41:44.717
<i>I said shut up!
( screams )</i>

42:02.984 --> 42:06.317
Tourist girls...

42:13.551 --> 42:15.384
Officer,

42:15.450 --> 42:17.684
get him out
of my sight.

43:18.417 --> 43:21.651
Lieutenant,
everything okay?

43:21.717 --> 43:23.183
I'm going to take it
from here, all right?

43:23.250 --> 43:25.651
Good night.
