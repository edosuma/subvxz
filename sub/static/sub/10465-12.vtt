34:15.900 --> 34:18.067
and rationalizing,

34:18.067 --> 34:20.000
but I wouldn't listen.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.801
What?
What are you talking about?

34:24.434 --> 34:27.167
I tried to explain it,

34:27.167 --> 34:30.534
how it felt...

34:30.534 --> 34:34.234
What it was like to be
in love with you.

34:34.234 --> 34:38.234
And I tried to defend it
because I love you so much.

34:39.434 --> 34:41.400
And all that time

34:41.400 --> 34:43.900
I was getting better,

34:43.900 --> 34:45.967
and I started
recognizing myself

34:45.967 --> 34:49.934
in the mirror again
and that felt--

34:49.934 --> 34:51.900
What?

34:53.333 --> 34:55.000
What?

34:57.033 --> 34:58.734
It's you, Charlie.

35:01.067 --> 35:03.567
I can't be with you.

35:06.567 --> 35:08.868
Okay.

35:08.868 --> 35:12.100
Okay. Obviously, we--
We tried to rush into this.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.601
Obviously, this was too soon
to think that we could do this,

35:14.601 --> 35:16.501
but that does not mean--
Charlie, I can't.

35:16.501 --> 35:18.033
That's what I'm trying--

35:18.033 --> 35:21.400
I'm just--

35:21.400 --> 35:24.567
I'm doing it again.

35:24.567 --> 35:27.033
I-I'm with you and I--

35:27.033 --> 35:30.701
And I think I'm happy, but--

35:30.701 --> 35:32.701
But it's always there.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.868
When you left me--

35:37.868 --> 35:40.100
The wedding--

35:40.100 --> 35:43.367
That was--

35:43.367 --> 35:45.067
That was just--
Wait a minute. What?

35:45.067 --> 35:47.200
This is about the wedding?

35:47.200 --> 35:49.868
That's not--
That's not fair, Kirsten.

35:49.868 --> 35:51.234
Charlie--
Look at me.

35:51.234 --> 35:53.634
I'm not-- I've--
I've changed, Kirsten.

35:53.634 --> 35:55.234
Look at me
since I've been with you.

35:55.234 --> 35:57.701
And look at me.

35:57.701 --> 36:01.801
I know that you've changed,
Charlie, but that's just--

36:01.801 --> 36:04.567
The wedding triggered it,
this thing.

36:04.567 --> 36:08.400
Something that was
already inside of me.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.133
And now you're all tangled up
in that somehow,

36:11.133 --> 36:14.634
and I can't just get past it.

36:14.634 --> 36:16.734
I--

36:16.734 --> 36:18.601
I tried to make it go away,

36:18.601 --> 36:21.567
but it just-- It won't.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.367
I love you.

36:26.367 --> 36:29.367
But every time I look at you,

36:29.367 --> 36:30.934
it's--

36:30.934 --> 36:33.000
It's all I see.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.267
And I know
it's not fair.

36:35.267 --> 36:37.534
And I know it's not your fault,

36:37.534 --> 36:40.033
but it's all I see.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.634
 <i>Darling.</i>

36:59.534 --> 37:01.767
[YAWNS]

37:01.767 --> 37:05.033
You don't have to be here
every minute, you know.

37:05.033 --> 37:07.367
Mm. I'm okay.

37:07.367 --> 37:10.334
I know that.

37:10.334 --> 37:12.267
So guess what?

37:12.267 --> 37:16.234
Dr. Eglar said I'll be able
to wear a bikini

37:16.234 --> 37:17.767
without showing a scar.

37:17.767 --> 37:21.367
Hey, that's a plus.

37:21.367 --> 37:23.501
I can help you
pick one out.

37:23.501 --> 37:27.901
There's a great indoor pool
at the Aquatic Center too.

37:27.901 --> 37:29.267
We should do that.

37:29.267 --> 37:31.334
The two of us, you know.

37:31.334 --> 37:34.667
Swim, check out the guys. Huh?

37:34.667 --> 37:37.200
How does that sound?

37:37.200 --> 37:40.133
Claud?

37:40.133 --> 37:42.501
SAM:
Where's my camera
when I need it?

37:42.501 --> 37:44.501
JULIA:
Hey.

37:44.501 --> 37:46.067
For me?

37:46.067 --> 37:49.100
Actually, no.
They're for Claudia.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.501
I hope flowers are okay.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.868
I didn't know whether
I should do that or candy

37:53.868 --> 37:56.033
or stuffed toy something.

37:56.033 --> 37:57.968
I've never been around
kids much, so.

37:57.968 --> 37:59.267
JULIA:
She loves flowers.

37:59.267 --> 38:02.367
It's sweet.

38:02.367 --> 38:07.067
So you haven't dated somebody
with kids before, huh?

38:07.067 --> 38:09.133
Can't say that I have.

38:09.133 --> 38:13.167
'Cause it's not
like I have kids,

38:13.167 --> 38:15.133
but I sort of do.

38:15.133 --> 38:19.000
And it's just
kind of how my life is.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.567
Sometimes I'm gonna
have to baby-sit,

38:21.567 --> 38:24.234
and sometimes I'm gonna have to
cancel at the last minute and--

38:24.234 --> 38:28.300
Sometimes you're gonna be
doing homework. I know.

38:28.300 --> 38:31.434
Whoa. That's weird.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.234
Hey, you know what?

38:33.234 --> 38:36.000
You're pretty amazing.

38:37.567 --> 38:39.467
Wow.

38:39.467 --> 38:42.567
Amazing. Huh.

38:42.567 --> 38:44.334
It's a good word.

38:47.434 --> 38:50.033
Julia.

38:50.033 --> 38:53.567
Hey, I'm right here, Owen.
I'm right here.

39:19.934 --> 39:21.701
Kirsten?

39:21.701 --> 39:25.267
Kirsten, honey,
are you all right?

39:25.267 --> 39:26.434
I'm fine, mom.

39:26.434 --> 39:29.167
Are you sure?
Are you?

39:29.167 --> 39:31.000
I'm glad
you came back.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.767
Charlie, I can't believe that--
Mom, don't.

39:34.767 --> 39:36.901
Okay? Not now.

39:42.601 --> 39:44.834
You wanna come inside?

39:44.834 --> 39:47.367
No.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.267
I don't think--

39:49.267 --> 39:51.767
[***]

39:51.767 --> 39:55.634
Could you just maybe, uh,
get my bag for me?

39:55.634 --> 39:57.701
I'm just gonna--

39:57.701 --> 40:00.467
Sure.

40:00.467 --> 40:02.400
I'll be right back.

40:06.434 --> 40:07.701
Kirsten.

40:07.701 --> 40:09.734
Yeah?

40:13.501 --> 40:14.801
Nothing.

40:14.801 --> 40:16.667
Just, uh,

40:16.667 --> 40:19.534
my shaving kit's
in the bathroom.

40:23.234 --> 40:25.100
I'll get it.

40:29.467 --> 40:31.267
Charlie,
how dare you.

40:31.267 --> 40:34.534
How dare you come here
and put her through this.

40:34.534 --> 40:37.000
What were you thinking?
What were you possibly thinking?

40:37.000 --> 40:40.634
You know what, Ellie, I'm not--

40:40.634 --> 40:43.067
Could you just send
my bag to me?

40:43.067 --> 40:44.334
I'll pay for it.

40:44.334 --> 40:46.601
What? Look, Kirsten just--

40:46.601 --> 40:48.300
Just send it to me.
Okay?

40:48.300 --> 40:52.267
I can't--
I can't do this again,

40:52.267 --> 40:54.767
and she shouldn't
have to either.

41:06.901 --> 41:10.334
 <i>* What else can I do? *</i>

41:10.334 --> 41:13.701
 <i>* But bring a blanket *</i>

41:13.701 --> 41:17.234
 <i>* For you *</i>

41:17.234 --> 41:21.334
So pretty
lame match, huh?

41:21.334 --> 41:23.167
Hm?

41:23.167 --> 41:25.667
I guess so.
Yeah.

41:29.100 --> 41:33.400
I think that one guy must have
lied about his weight class.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.300
He was a gorilla.

41:36.300 --> 41:38.901
Yeah.
But you put up a good fight.

41:41.868 --> 41:44.534
Um...

41:44.534 --> 41:46.567
I'm half done.

41:46.567 --> 41:48.734
You ready to trade?

41:51.033 --> 41:52.767
Yeah.

41:57.934 --> 42:01.334

42:08.234 --> 42:12.267
