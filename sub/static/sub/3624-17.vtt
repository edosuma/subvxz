energy source known...

00:11.779 --> 00:12.811
are you for real?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.013
I was with you.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.682
I know what it is,
Dr. exposition.

00:16.684 --> 00:20.019
Fine! I was just
enjoying the moment.

00:20.021 --> 00:20.819
Aah!

00:20.821 --> 00:22.254
Sorry to spoil it.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.157
And where's the boy
who always loses his pants?

00:25.159 --> 00:27.126
Ron: I do not
always lose my pants!

00:27.128 --> 00:29.962
Just a little grapple trouble.

Kim, it's
your half-iversary.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.275
Well, I did get Ron
a little something.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.177
The pants thing?
The pants thing.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.645
Good gift.
Wade whipped it up.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.853
Say what?
We visit the kids

02:34.855 --> 02:35.921
in my mom's hospital.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.257
I guess I'm
sort of famous to them.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.260
And Ron's
sort of... Infamous.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.863
Any clown can do

02:44.865 --> 02:46.431

02:46.433 --> 02:48.367
True that.
Oh, before we go,

02:48.369 --> 02:49.835
I got you a little present.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.737

Well, today is

02:51.739 --> 02:52.971
our half-iversary.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.706
Oh, that's great!

02:54.708 --> 02:55.674
What's
a half-iversary?

02:55.676 --> 02:58.177
Dating for 6 months.
Half a year.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.845
Oh, cool, look at that,

02:59.847 --> 03:03.148
I think it would help you
with your pants problem.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.724
Shego, where have you been?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.159
Uh, day off, remember?

03:14.161 --> 03:16.295
What's going on? Why are
you still in your jammies?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.163
I fell asleep
on the couch last night

03:18.165 --> 03:19.364
watching
that dance show I like.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.233
<i>Ballroom with "B" actors?</i>

03:21.235 --> 03:23.235
And you fell asleep?
Go figure.

03:23.237 --> 03:27.739
My best take-over-the-world
plan ever!

03:27.741 --> 03:28.840
Ugh, that again?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.209
No, no, no.
This plan is foolproof.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.977
And it begins with you
tearing up the lair?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.178
No. I wrote it
on the back of a magazine

03:33.180 --> 03:35.280
so I wouldn't forget,
and now I can't find it!

03:35.282 --> 03:37.249
Oh, I think I took it
to the nail place.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.384

03:39.386 --> 03:41.153
"Kirk, yoink, sputter."

03:41.155 --> 03:44.489
I swear I was awake.
This makes no sense!

03:44.491 --> 03:49.127
This sounds like quite a
breakthrough in memory research.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.162
I've spent 5 years

03:50.164 --> 03:52.364
working with
the Middleton hospital

03:52.366 --> 03:54.266
to develop the M.R.M.,

03:54.268 --> 03:57.102
the memory recovery
machine, if you will.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.770
People suffering from amnesia

03:58.772 --> 04:00.572
haven't really
lost their memories.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.075
Precisely, they've
lost access to them.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.143
The M.R.M. Re-establishes

04:05.145 --> 04:07.179
the mental link, if you will.

04:07.181 --> 04:08.213
[Humming]

04:08.215 --> 04:10.782
Oh, I left the stove on.
Gotta go!

04:10.784 --> 04:12.184
Shego, with that machine,

04:12.186 --> 04:14.920
I could remember
my foolproof plan.

04:14.922 --> 04:20.125
From now on, I'm going to write
down all my ideas on 3x5 cards.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.127
"Go to hospital."

04:22.129 --> 04:23.829
"Steal machine."

04:23.831 --> 04:26.531
"Remember
foolproof plan."

04:26.533 --> 04:30.936
You are not going to become
one of those list guys.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.272
That is so lame.

04:33.274 --> 04:37.209
"Tell Shego to zip it."

04:37.211 --> 04:40.245
Kim: Remember,
we're here to cheer,

04:40.247 --> 04:41.280
but not too much cheer.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.181
Kim, laughter
is the best medicine.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.851
Unless, you know, you have an
acute case of the giggles.

04:45.853 --> 04:49.354
Then the cure is worse
than the condition.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.189
Children: Rufus!

04:51.191 --> 04:52.190
Whoa, all right!

04:52.192 --> 04:55.060
All right, whoa!

04:58.164 --> 04:59.164

"sneaky."

05:06.240 --> 05:08.006
Yeah, so I'm sneaky.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.941
Next, we break into the lab,

05:09.943 --> 05:11.209
steal the M.R.M.,

05:11.211 --> 05:12.511
and remember my foolproof plan.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.480
And then we bowl
with the henchmen!

05:31.165 --> 05:33.165
Now... now we... Um...

total waste of my time.

has been erased!

If Kim
re-experiences things,

but one drop of this will turn
you into a mindless zombie!

20:04.403 --> 20:06.304
Any luck, Rufus?

20:06.306 --> 20:08.706
It's ok, buddy.
Just take it slow.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.975
Ok, right.
Don't take it slow.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.777
Try the blue one.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.346
Ron: Not the blue one,
not the blue one!

20:21.286 --> 20:23.788
Ha! That's right, run!

20:23.790 --> 20:27.291
I don't think
I remember her running away.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.193
Neither do I.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.329
I remember winning.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.331
Give me the...

20:33.333 --> 20:36.167
[shouting]

20:36.169 --> 20:38.436
Aah!

20:41.373 --> 20:46.377
It was supposed
to be foolproof!

20:48.914 --> 20:50.181
Oh, now they're flashing.

20:50.183 --> 20:52.817
Try a different one,
a different one!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.455
Whoa!

20:58.957 --> 21:01.392
Whoa!

21:04.029 --> 21:05.396
Ron, shut down the steam vent.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.164
How? It's all steamy.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.066
Close off the pipe
with something.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.135
Oh, uh...

21:31.156 --> 21:32.523
Way to go, K.P.!

21:32.525 --> 21:34.325
Just saving the world.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.227
Um, Ron?

21:36.229 --> 21:37.962
Oh, man. That so tanks!

21:37.964 --> 21:41.999
Good plan, but that's
not why I gave you the belt.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.111
I remember, I remember!

21:54.113 --> 21:55.846
I gave you the belt
for our half-iversary.

21:55.848 --> 21:59.150
Yeah, I still don't
get what exactly that is.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.185
Ron, I remember
that you're my boyfriend

22:01.187 --> 22:02.520
and that I think I love you.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.222
For real?
For real.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.192
Now, this is a memory.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.594
Aww.

22:10.596 --> 22:14.131
Oddly enough,
I have a card for this.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.033
"Dr. D. Fails."

22:16.035 --> 22:18.502
[Growling]

22:18.504 --> 22:22.006
Watching a little <i>captain
constellation, i see.</i>

22:22.008 --> 22:23.908
Best show ever. Right, Kim?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.910
For some reason,
I know all the episodes,

22:25.912 --> 22:27.611
but I can't stand this show.

22:27.613 --> 22:30.247
Uh, must be suppressed memory

22:30.249 --> 22:33.284
mixed with, uh,
negative experience,

22:33.286 --> 22:34.385
causing confusion.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.320
Yeah, what he said.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.855
Or your father
could have compressed

22:37.857 --> 22:39.490
3 seasons of episodes
for you to watch

22:39.492 --> 22:41.559
while you were getting
your memory back.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.160
That would explain it.
