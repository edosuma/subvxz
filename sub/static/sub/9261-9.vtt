WEBVTT

00:00.340 --> 00:01.780
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

00:01.790 --> 00:03.290
How's the quick-mealer business going?

00:03.325 --> 00:04.790
The machines are still here, which means

00:04.800 --> 00:06.760
You're still lining your
pocket on the department's dime.

00:06.795 --> 00:08.195
You wanna keep the machines, go ahead.

00:08.230 --> 00:10.200
Why,so you can still have
it to hang over my head?

00:10.235 --> 00:11.220
Yeah,that's right.

00:11.230 --> 00:13.280
My detective found 12
bodies hacked to pieces.

00:13.290 --> 00:14.770
Well,11 bodies,one arm.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.120
The killers were salvadoran.

00:16.129 --> 00:17.670
The victims were all mexicans.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.800
Eduardo romero? Glad we
found the rest of you.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.100
I'm a Mexican official.
Diplomatic immunity.

00:22.110 --> 00:24.800
He was present at the
San Marcos murders.

00:24.810 --> 00:25.840
We want him to stick around,

00:25.860 --> 00:28.990
We make sure his $230,000
luggage gets lost.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.370
For the exploratory committee.

00:30.390 --> 00:31.750
It's only for 100,000.

00:31.770 --> 00:32.910
You'll get the other half

00:32.920 --> 00:35.370
When the people responsible
for the San Marcos killings

00:35.380 --> 00:36.280
Are brought to justice.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.280
There's an operative
inside the Salvadorans

00:38.290 --> 00:40.520
Who can help solve the
San Marcos house murders.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.290
Mexicans got something big brewing.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.520
Salvadorans want a piece of it.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.890
Chopping up the bodies, San Marcos
was all about sending a message.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.300
You know who the Salvadorans were

00:48.310 --> 00:49.910
Who were swinging the
machetes at San Marcos?

00:49.930 --> 00:51.950
It'd be the death of my
crew if I started asking.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.950
Did you talk to Shane?

00:52.970 --> 00:53.920
He killed Lem.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.070
I know what you did to Lem.

00:55.090 --> 00:56.030
Like this journal.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.870
Everything on paper that we have done,

00:57.880 --> 01:00.070
And you're trying to blackmail
us and that is no b.S.

01:00.090 --> 01:02.270
Tell Kesakian I got a
business proposition for him.

01:02.780 --> 01:03.990
I'm a cop he's gonna need to know.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.920
I'm an associate of Essagian.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.110
Santi's insulated.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.000
Been a while since we had a good
relationship with law enforcement.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.220
Shane: that's funny. I'm a fixer.

01:11.230 --> 01:12.020
I'm Kesakian.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.830
Ok, I need to speak to the real Kesakian.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.890
My father's out of town.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.630
How long do you think you
can keep this a secret?

01:16.650 --> 01:18.080
Long enough for a miracle.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.050
In the meantime,you think
you're running the show?

01:20.060 --> 01:22.120
It's only a matter of time
before Rezian finds out

01:22.130 --> 01:23.270
Your father's out of the game.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.410
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

01:25.430 --> 01:27.290
My father still has a
lot of men loyal to him,

01:27.690 --> 01:28.610
And now I have you.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.310
Claudette's been playing you
since the day I showed up.

01:31.330 --> 01:32.660
She figured you'd be easier to handle

01:32.680 --> 01:34.180
If you thought there was a future here,

01:34.190 --> 01:36.610
Meanwhile orchestrating
things so there won't be.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.130
You caught the man that killed emily?

01:38.570 --> 01:40.800
Yeah. Do you know what
your daughter was doing

01:40.810 --> 01:41.690
To get her drugs?

01:42.060 --> 01:43.860
That's not how history has to read.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.590
Thank you.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.850
I've got an appeals hearing
in a couple of weeks.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.680
They're gonna decide whether
to force me out or not.

01:49.690 --> 01:50.740
I'll see what I can do.

01:58.070 --> 02:00.010
You're gonna have to
fire your secretary.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.290
I don't think she's giving
you all your messages.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.650
Look, I still need to
reach a few more people

02:05.670 --> 02:07.300
Before I know where you stand.

02:07.310 --> 02:08.910
I told you where I stand.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.710
They're kicking me
to the curb next week.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.650
The question is, how you gonna stop it

02:12.670 --> 02:14.230
Like you promised?

02:14.250 --> 02:15.980
It's not as manageable as I thought.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.890
You mean, not as manageable

02:17.900 --> 02:19.410
As keeping your daughter's
drugging and whoring

02:19.420 --> 02:21.480
Out of the press after her death? Huh?

02:22.270 --> 02:24.760
Look, I am doing all i
can, detective Mackey,

02:24.770 --> 02:28.200
But I keep slamming up against
your enemies in the department.

02:28.210 --> 02:29.230
We had a deal:

02:29.240 --> 02:31.230
Your daughter's reputation for my job.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.460
Get back to me tomorrow.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.260
What do you want?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.850
An update on the San Marcos murders.

02:45.780 --> 02:46.660
Who are you?

02:47.590 --> 02:50.460
Cruz Pezuela. He's representing
a local development company

02:50.480 --> 02:53.770
That has the backing of various
Mexican investment interests.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.340
What's that got to do with San Marcos?

02:56.350 --> 02:59.580
The San Marcos slaughter angered
a lot of people here and in mexico.

02:59.590 --> 03:01.520
Yeah, we weren't exactly
thrilled about it.

03:01.530 --> 03:04.400
Did you follow up on the
Salvadoran gang lead we gave you?

03:04.710 --> 03:06.380
Yeah. Can't rule them out.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.060
Well,Cruz has brought me another lead,

03:08.070 --> 03:09.300
And I want you two to look into it.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.060
Go through the captain. She's the
only one that gives us marching orders.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.930
It's a suspect, Javier Rincon,

03:14.240 --> 03:16.660
A Salvadoran gang member
who's in county jail right now.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.750
Who's your source?

03:17.770 --> 03:18.880
Doesn't want to be involved.

03:19.610 --> 03:20.950
What is it with you people?

03:20.960 --> 03:23.570
We got a guy who got his
arm chopped off at San Marcos

03:23.590 --> 03:25.150
Hiding out at the Mexican consulate.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.930
Now your source wants
to hide behind you?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.580
The community either wants us to
solve this crime or it doesn't.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.220
We do.

03:30.230 --> 03:31.170
Rincon's in county?

03:32.220 --> 03:34.770
Well, If he was spouting his
mouth off about San Marcos,

03:34.790 --> 03:36.090
Trust me, I would have heard about it.

03:37.670 --> 03:39.270
I don't remember you two
being on the schedule.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.380
Cesar Orozco. He's my source.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.030
Works construction for my company.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.030
My office will give
you the site location.

03:49.450 --> 03:50.500
Now you can do something.

03:58.190 --> 04:01.190
Aceveda and his amigo had
another tip about San Marcos.

04:01.210 --> 04:02.180
Sounds like bullshit.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.990
Yeah,but at least
it's specific bullshit.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.260
If it's easy to comfirm
or knock down,do it,

04:07.250 --> 04:10.130
But no more secret powwows
with them and without me.

04:10.630 --> 04:12.990
Ronnie'll find out if
Rincon has any priors.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.330
I'll find out about Orozco.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.350
We've been operating on
a favor to favor basis.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.660
What you're asking, this is taking me

04:22.670 --> 04:25.380
Deeper into the belly of the
Armenian beast than I ever intended.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.440
I'll pay you more.

04:26.450 --> 04:27.960
This isn't a charge by the hour.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.570
I'd need a percentage.

04:30.430 --> 04:32.070
You'll be my partner in this country.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.670
Your apartment ain't safe anymore.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.380
Next few days, I want
you to check into a motel.

04:37.390 --> 04:38.470
They wouldn't dare to hurt me.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.720
They know what my father would do.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.160
Don't be so confident that your
father's condition is such a secret.

04:42.730 --> 04:43.795
Gangs know,

04:43.830 --> 04:45.930
And rumors have a way
of turning to fact.

04:46.530 --> 04:47.710
I will find a motel.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.830
You can't assassinate your way
into filling daddy's shoes,either.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.230
Soldiers see too many heads
roll, they get nervous.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.700
But I need a demonstration
of my power,yes?

04:56.720 --> 04:58.510
Money's the blood of
these organizations,

04:59.170 --> 05:00.810
And whoever's supplying it is the heart.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.350
Now who's putting the most
cash into the peasants' pockets?

05:04.750 --> 05:06.720
Rezian. He runs the ports.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.950
Importing of all kinds.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.150
It's over 40% of my father's business.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.150
Well,he's the one who's
gonna be looking to take over.

05:14.010 --> 05:15.130
He's a threat.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.770
You willing to take a short
term hit for a long term gain?

05:20.250 --> 05:21.890
I've ready to save what my father built.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.220
Rincon's serving 6
months on an ag assault.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.610
They let him out 3
days ago after a month.

05:28.630 --> 05:29.700
They threw the case out?

05:29.720 --> 05:31.540
Too many shitheads, not enough pillows.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.250
The only thing distracting them is P.O.

05:37.580 --> 05:38.990
My revue panel's next week.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.160
Any last minute advice?

05:41.170 --> 05:42.310
Just tell your story.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.660
So what do you think my chances are?

05:43.670 --> 05:45.400
I've learned not to bet against you.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.180
Even if it's a sure thing?

05:49.870 --> 05:53.010
It fixed. Panel's
already decided I'm out.

05:54.130 --> 05:56.260
Hiatt doesn't know all the facts.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.100
He should have kept his mouth shut.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:07.260 --> 06:09.120
You're not even gonna
give me a fair shot?

06:09.130 --> 06:12.070
You threw away your fair shot
by taking so many crooked ones.

06:12.610 --> 06:13.590
You've got a week.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.660
I need every man on deck.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.390
If you're not up to it, you
don't have to wait for the panel.

06:22.910 --> 06:25.140
Your quarterly stats are due next week.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.370
I'm gonna solve San Marcos

06:27.390 --> 06:30.030
And get you that numbers bump
you need to save this place.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.100
And then you just try to
sit in front of that panel

06:32.110 --> 06:33.650
And tell 'em you don't
need me around here.

06:34.730 --> 06:39.670

06:45.960 --> 06:47.680
What were you inside for,cesar?

06:47.690 --> 06:49.360
I hit my wife or something.
That's what she said.

06:49.370 --> 06:51.880
Relax,man, we don't care about
how you keep your lady in line.

06:51.890 --> 06:53.270
Just tell us about Rincon.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.250
I heard him bragging, you
know? San Marcos or something,

06:56.270 --> 06:57.310
So I tried to listen.

06:57.330 --> 06:59.850
You're Mexican. How'd you get
close enough to the Salvadorans

06:59.860 --> 07:00.780
To hear all that?

07:00.790 --> 07:02.360
We both worked in the cafeteria.

07:02.860 --> 07:04.590
I heard Rincon tell the other guy

07:04.600 --> 07:06.470
That he hacked them up
while they were still alive.

07:06.650 --> 07:08.180
Him and 2 other guys.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.560
Rincon say why he killed 'em?

07:11.190 --> 07:12.230
I gotta go.

07:12.410 --> 07:14.400
Hey,you go when I say you go.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.150
Look,just answer his questions.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.690
You'll get back to
your job a lot sooner.

07:17.710 --> 07:19.480
Man, I told senor Pezuela everything.

07:19.490 --> 07:21.180
What's Pezuela's interest in this?

07:21.200 --> 07:23.230
How's a guy like you even
get face time with him?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.110
Everybody knows that
he wants the Salvadorans

07:25.130 --> 07:26.270
Who did the San Marcos.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.300
Yeah,but why?

07:27.310 --> 07:28.850
You could have told the Mexicans inside.

07:28.860 --> 07:30.490
You know they would've
taken care of Rincon.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.910
I was the only one to get close to him.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.290
If I would have said something,

07:33.300 --> 07:34.380
They would have had me do the murder.

07:34.390 --> 07:35.210
Yeah. You were scared?

07:35.220 --> 07:38.000
It's not like he's your
old lady or nothing.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.340
This is Garine Essagian.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.030
She keeps the books at this
Armenian bakery I go to.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.560
Come here. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

07:48.370 --> 07:50.720
My boss has started me on
working his other business.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.370
I noticed something wrong

07:52.380 --> 07:55.130
When I was going
through, um,how you say?

07:55.140 --> 07:56.250
Uh, inventory.

07:56.260 --> 07:57.730
The inventory.

07:57.740 --> 07:59.700
Her boss is a guy named Rezian.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.350
The bakery is a cover

08:02.060 --> 08:03.660
For his extensive import business.

08:05.370 --> 08:06.830
Would you mind stepping out a minute?

08:06.850 --> 08:08.750
Detective vendrell
will be right with you.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.850
Just take a seat right over there.

08:14.170 --> 08:16.450
Does she have any idea
what her boss would do

08:16.460 --> 08:17.870
If he knew she was even in here?

08:17.880 --> 08:20.160
Rezian is the Armenian
heavy down at the ports.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.150
His people rubber stamp
the inspection process.

08:22.185 --> 08:23.590
This guy's got an open door

08:23.600 --> 08:25.040
To get whatever he
wants into this country.

08:25.050 --> 08:26.070
Why do I get the feeling

08:26.090 --> 08:27.520
You're trying to find your own thing,

08:27.530 --> 08:29.000
Distance yourself from Vic?

08:29.470 --> 08:31.430
She's got the books going back 2 years.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.210
You wanna get a warrant or not?

08:33.230 --> 08:35.539
Solving San Marcos is top priority.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.549
We don't jump, she could lose her nerve,

08:37.919 --> 08:39.549
And there's plenty of
bodies to go around.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.700
If Hiatt agrees and
the team can handle it,

08:44.720 --> 08:45.600
Then I'm ok with it.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.410
But I don't want to
find her chopped off feet

08:47.420 --> 08:48.530
On my desk tomorrow morning.

08:48.550 --> 08:49.200
Yes,ma'am.

08:51.110 --> 08:52.620
Hey,where are we with Rincon?

08:53.150 --> 08:54.820
Left his parole officer 2 messages.

08:55.090 --> 08:56.560
You wanna hit some Salvadoran hot spots?

08:56.570 --> 08:58.410
No. If he knows we're
looking, he'll turtle.

08:58.420 --> 08:59.440
Let's wait for the P.O.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.680
The feds have been trying
to wrest control of the ports

09:01.690 --> 09:03.090
Away from the Armenians for years.

09:03.270 --> 09:04.280
We can do it in a day.

09:04.660 --> 09:07.720
Bust this Rezian. Cut off the
Armenians stronghold on the docks.

09:07.950 --> 09:08.870
What's Rezian running?

09:09.260 --> 09:12.300
Drugs,girls, lately gasoline.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.600
Stolen,uninspected, untaxed.

09:14.610 --> 09:17.100
Shane's got some solid intel
on this guy named Rezian.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.820
I brought in this girl who can help
us cut off the Armenians at the knees.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.790
Can we save the wild stabs in the dark

09:21.800 --> 09:24.150
Until after we've caught
the machete wielding psychos?

09:24.530 --> 09:25.970
No reason we can't do both.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.120
Julian,go with Shane.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.860
The rest of us stay on San Marcos.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.960
Ronnie here would raise a lot
fewer eyebrows in Little Armenia.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.400
All right. Make me proud.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.540
Shane's up to something,
and I want to know what.

09:44.030 --> 09:46.480
That would've been a great case
for julian to cut his teeth on.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.320
You let Vic make you
doubt your instincts.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.850
I'm not so insecure that I can't
take good advice, all right?

09:51.940 --> 09:53.710
You know what happens if Vic
wins that appeals hearing?

09:53.720 --> 09:56.170
He waits about 2 seconds
to reclaim his throne,

09:56.180 --> 09:57.580
Gets you bounced out of here.

09:58.870 --> 09:59.690
I'm just saying.

10:05.770 --> 10:06.690
Oh,excuse me.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.000
You helping out detective vendrell?

10:11.810 --> 10:12.600
Yes.

10:12.870 --> 10:13.850
That's good,huh?

10:16.600 --> 10:17.480
Vic Mackey.

10:18.210 --> 10:19.100
How do you know Shane?

10:19.890 --> 10:21.300
He likes the bakery where I work.

10:22.390 --> 10:24.640
Hey, I need your help.

10:24.820 --> 10:27.850
My Armenian's not what it should be.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.090
Vic: pleasure.

10:31.010 --> 10:31.790
Pleasure.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.380
Shane definitely knows this girl.

10:44.980 --> 10:46.710
Well,he wouldn't mess with
the Armenians out of school.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.750
Not with our history.

10:47.785 --> 10:48.780
How can you be so sure?

10:49.420 --> 10:51.610
I never thought Shane would
dig himself in such a hole

10:51.620 --> 10:53.840
With antwon mitchell to
become his bitch, but he did.

10:56.270 --> 10:57.970
Keep an eye on him.
Find out what he's into

10:58.470 --> 10:59.910
And whether it can blow back on us.

11:10.860 --> 11:12.110
Sounds like it's coming from the back.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.050
Yeah. We need Rincon to
give up the other killers,

11:14.070 --> 11:15.080
So follow my lead.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.340
Police. We need to
talk to Javier Rincon.

11:27.230 --> 11:28.240
Just need to chat him up.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.660
His P.O. Said we could find him here.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.530
Just take a second.

11:32.110 --> 11:32.820
What do you want?

11:32.840 --> 11:35.290
Javier,can you step out front
so we can talk to you,please?

11:35.300 --> 11:36.420
I'm not leaving,man.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.340
They released me early. I
got papers and everything.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.740
We know you're free and clear.

11:41.340 --> 11:42.370
Then talk to my ass.

11:44.450 --> 11:46.770
Bring it out the front
and shoot the shit.

11:58.740 --> 11:59.680
Vic. Vic!

12:05.600 --> 12:06.740
Back it up,man.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.470
Now,you can come on your own,

12:12.480 --> 12:14.670
Or I can drag you through
you friends' blood.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.050
You killed 12 people.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.770
Now the Mexicans want you dead.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.250
We turn you over to them right now,

12:21.260 --> 12:23.610
Maybe we stop a gang
war. Save a lot of lives.

12:23.630 --> 12:24.710
I didn't kill nobody.

12:24.890 --> 12:25.870
Your choice.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.500
And you get what you deserve,

12:29.510 --> 12:31.430
Or you give us the other killers,

12:31.840 --> 12:33.450
I fix it so you walk away.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.160
You won't do it.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.740
Take us to byz lat hood.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.780
Let the Mexicans get
the answers out of him.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.030
That what you want?

12:40.730 --> 12:41.750
He made his choice.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.350
No. Back to the barn. Now.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.700
Throw this asshole in the cage.

12:59.000 --> 12:59.800
What the hell was that?

12:59.820 --> 13:00.990
I was about to ask you the same thing.

13:01.010 --> 13:02.970
Well, I was gonna get the
names of the other 2 killers

13:02.980 --> 13:04.090
Until you shit all over it.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.460
This thing is too important
to play fast and loose.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.680
Yeah? Well, I hope
you have another plan.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.400
'Cause these salvans
don't give up their own

13:09.420 --> 13:10.890
Unless it's to save their own skins.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.440
We can't use a coerced confession.

13:13.430 --> 13:14.610
Who's gonna say it was coerced?

13:14.630 --> 13:16.720
You know what? Some of us are
gonna be here long than a week.

13:16.740 --> 13:19.020
Let's get a little sneak peek
at what that's gonna look like.

13:19.820 --> 13:21.250
You can handle the interrogation.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.200
I'll call you later,hon.

13:32.050 --> 13:32.720
Who are you?

13:32.730 --> 13:33.970
We're the police.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.190
You got a warrant?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.690
We prefer good old
fashioned cooperation.

13:37.260 --> 13:37.970
I don't.

13:40.040 --> 13:40.990
A guy named Rezian,

13:41.360 --> 13:42.730
What do you see in
every one of those ships

13:42.750 --> 13:44.020
That's been through
here in the last week?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.340
We got cameras.

13:47.350 --> 13:49.240
You touch me, and I'll sue the city

13:49.270 --> 13:50.970
For that house i've
been wanting in oxnard.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.000
That's the way to dream big.

13:52.690 --> 13:54.170
We know you're on Rezian's payroll.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.640
He tells you which cargo
is safe for inspection.

13:56.650 --> 13:58.650
You let the rest slide
in under the radar.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.440
For all we know,you're rubber
stamping the import of nuclear bombs.

14:01.460 --> 14:03.610
I got a pal, homeland security.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.340
His favorite hobby is pulling
the patriot act out of his ass.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.260
Or we could get what we need another way

14:10.270 --> 14:11.770
And just tell the
Armenians it came from you.

14:11.780 --> 14:12.990
Now,that's just plain mean.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.620
Rezian's got a ship coming in every day.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.630
They usually unload around 3:00.

14:20.650 --> 14:22.640
Great. That gives us the afternoon

14:22.650 --> 14:24.250
To hear everything you
know about the Armenians.

14:24.260 --> 14:26.840
Waste of time. They're not gonna
let this pissant into the loop.

14:26.850 --> 14:27.930
Come on. Let's go.

14:32.150 --> 14:33.360
You breath a word about this to Rezian,

14:33.740 --> 14:36.120
I'll find you...
somewhere without a camera.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.920
This is your last
chance to save yourself.

14:43.330 --> 14:44.470
You give me names,

14:44.490 --> 14:47.160
I recommend to the judge you
do your time in a safe place.

14:47.630 --> 14:48.450
A safe place?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:58.570 --> 14:59.680
He won't give up the others.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.290
We're gonna have to
find some other leverage.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.410
One killer's a start.

15:02.910 --> 15:05.030
Will the construction
worker Orozco testify?

15:05.050 --> 15:05.870
I think so,yes.

15:05.880 --> 15:06.770
Why's that? That's a mistake.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.170
The kind of guys who'll chop
up a house full of people?

15:10.190 --> 15:11.830
I hate to think what they'd do next

15:11.850 --> 15:13.310
Or who they'd be doing it for.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.270
What are you talking about?

15:15.620 --> 15:16.700
Remember the one-armed man

15:16.710 --> 15:17.920
With the suitcase full of cash?

15:17.930 --> 15:20.250
First the Mexican
government sent him his ID

15:20.260 --> 15:23.300
Then Pezuela shows up with
his arm up aceveda's ass,

15:23.320 --> 15:25.900
Getting tips from prison,
representing a company

15:25.910 --> 15:27.680
With the backing of Mexican interests?

15:27.690 --> 15:29.020
Now there's a conspiracy?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.540
Solving these 12 murders

15:30.550 --> 15:31.820
Is as big as I need now.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.210
Then let me get Rincon to talk.

15:36.450 --> 15:38.080
But if you'd rather
walk away with half a win

15:38.100 --> 15:39.430
And the other killers
free to do it again,

15:39.810 --> 15:41.050
You stick with your boy here.

15:50.690 --> 15:52.430
I can't drop you off in byzland,

15:52.930 --> 15:54.340
But word that you're the killer

15:54.350 --> 15:55.760
Is gonna hit the Mexican
side of the street,

15:55.780 --> 15:56.660
If it hasn't already.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.160
Means I need my own
people to keep my back.

15:59.470 --> 16:01.980
Unless I can convince Santi
and the rest of the Mexicans

16:02.010 --> 16:02.920
That you didn't do it.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.910
It takes your price off the street.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.580
You give us the other
killers that we need,

16:07.590 --> 16:10.040
You can start scheduling
your next welcome home party.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.880
You can convince the wetbacks?

16:12.030 --> 16:12.850
Count on it.

16:13.020 --> 16:14.780
I gotta hear with my own ears.

16:14.790 --> 16:15.860
No probLem.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.910
Japanese american male.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.510
Single hit to the head. Bruised chin.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.660
Bit of a scuffle, but he
didn't put up much of a fight.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.140
Looks like Dorothy was
an internet cruiser.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.500
Maybe he invited the wrong
person over for a quickie.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.230
Ladies and gents, we've
got ourselves a homicide.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.710
No sign of forced entry.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.030
Yeah,not in the apartment,anyway.

16:35.510 --> 16:36.920
Uh,what about a murder weapon?

16:36.930 --> 16:38.210
We've been all through the place.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.060
The guy actually filled out his
emergency contact information.

16:42.050 --> 16:43.490
His parents live in eagle rock.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.170
I hate notifications.

16:45.190 --> 16:46.040
Steve can do it.

16:46.050 --> 16:46.930
Oh,no. No way.

16:46.950 --> 16:49.010
The folks probably didn't even
know junior switched sides.

16:49.970 --> 16:52.160
I'm really gonna miss
that quick-mealer.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.330
Fine.

16:56.040 --> 16:56.860
Can I have that?

17:01.220 --> 17:02.750
Mama-san balled all over me.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.750
I put an internet profile on
your desk. You should read it.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.530
Have you ever seen a japanese lady wail?

17:08.310 --> 17:09.349
Somebody had to do it.

17:09.369 --> 17:10.470
Danny or Tina.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.750
I'm not gonna let you rule my life
over this vending machine thing.

17:13.770 --> 17:16.390
Sure you are. Read the profile.

17:17.609 --> 17:19.140
"Mason heller. Film nut.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.310
Good guy looking for someone
looking for something real."

17:21.329 --> 17:24.430
Our suspect. Called the victim
6 times in the last 8 days,

17:24.440 --> 17:25.750
Final time last night at 10:00.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.520
M.E. Puts tentative t.O.D. At 11:00.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.660
Here he is, even as we speak.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.430
Hey, I tried that
restaurant you recommended.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.980
Best spring rolls in l.A.,right?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.090
Yeah. Anyway, thanks for the tip.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.000
Guess whose apartment is 2 blocks
away from where the victim lives.

17:42.350 --> 17:43.920
I thought we'd head back to the scene,

17:43.940 --> 17:45.920
See if Mason dropped the
murder weapon on the way home.

17:45.940 --> 17:46.810
Good thinking.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.320
Is this a friday? It
feels like a wednesday.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.640
Yeah,day after thursday,

17:54.650 --> 17:56.770
Which relates to you bashing
your lover's face in how?

17:58.940 --> 17:59.890
Tell me about Alan.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.170
I really should go.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.570
Well,you're not under arrest.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.580
But if you do try to leave,

18:07.590 --> 18:10.200
We will file charges and
detain you officially.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.240
What happened to your hand?

18:12.450 --> 18:14.250
Maybe you cut it
flattening a guy's skull.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.280
Mason? Mason?

18:19.830 --> 18:21.070
I know this is hard.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.880
Oh,come on. This is the male version

18:22.890 --> 18:24.240
Of the same old pathetic story.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.280
Guy gets the hots bad
for a nice piece of ass

18:26.290 --> 18:27.460
And he can't deal with rejection.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.910
You wanna be pissed at me,get
even, don't do it in there.

18:38.920 --> 18:39.830
Aw, come on. It's not my fault

18:39.850 --> 18:40.960
The guy's got one
foot in the psych ward.

18:40.980 --> 18:43.810
He's just fragile. And since
psychological complexity

18:43.820 --> 18:46.040
Isn't exactly your strong suit,back off.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.440
Do you got any crisp singles?

18:50.140 --> 18:52.260
I wanna get a cup of soup
out of one of your machines

18:52.280 --> 18:53.250
While they're still there.

19:02.540 --> 19:03.650
Have to be getting close.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.040
It cost me 60 bucks to fill my truck.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.160
Of course,mara insists on full serve.

19:15.090 --> 19:16.300
You want to chat up a buddy,

19:16.970 --> 19:17.850
Go find one.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.600
That's Rezian. This is it.

19:40.190 --> 19:41.270
So do I need to watch my back?

19:41.810 --> 19:42.590
Do i?

19:46.700 --> 19:48.750
Hey,police! Let's go!
Down on your knees!

19:48.760 --> 19:50.030
On your knees. On your knees.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.520
Drop that money! Drop that money!

19:54.360 --> 19:55.210
You're under arrest

19:55.650 --> 19:57.300
For the importing of illegal goods.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.550
You mention one word

19:58.570 --> 20:00.230
About how I helped you out
with that gas station owner

20:00.630 --> 20:01.680
And I'll up the charge to murder.

20:01.690 --> 20:03.060
You make big mistake.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.310
Yeah. I'll call for transport.

20:05.210 --> 20:06.940
My people won't let
you get away with this.

20:08.030 --> 20:08.920
You don't have people.

20:09.460 --> 20:10.960
Kesakian junior's in charge now,

20:11.130 --> 20:12.570
So your crew ain't happening.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.480
You keep causing trouble,

20:14.980 --> 20:16.720
We'll just suffocate
you on your own gonads.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.090
Was Alan thinking about
filing a restraining order?

20:22.920 --> 20:24.190
Ok. Thanks for your help.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.550
Welcome back.

20:25.570 --> 20:26.870
Wish we had better news.

20:26.880 --> 20:27.670
No murder weapon?

20:27.680 --> 20:29.250
No. Walked it 5 different ways.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.250
Looked under every bush,
hit every trash can.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.320
Wait a minute. You got
these 2 beautiful women

20:33.340 --> 20:34.390
Looking in trash cans?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.640
Tina: it's part of the job, right?

20:36.280 --> 20:37.490
Dutch: ha ha ha ha.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.470
Garbage pickup's tomorrow afternoon.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.100
Ok.

20:42.540 --> 20:43.260
Hey, my man.

20:43.630 --> 20:44.220
Hey.

20:45.310 --> 20:46.170
You are my hero.

20:48.010 --> 20:48.720
Oh,yeah?

20:49.490 --> 20:50.280
Why's that?

20:51.270 --> 20:52.020
Hanlon.

20:53.170 --> 20:55.460
Oh, I'm sorry. I just assumed,
the way she talks about you.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.110
Never mind.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.530
I don't make a habit of banging chicks

20:58.540 --> 20:59.880
That know where to
find me in the morning.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.260
So the Dutchman has a shot then?

21:04.300 --> 21:05.150
Dutch?

21:05.170 --> 21:07.120
Sure. You get her fires all stoked,

21:07.660 --> 21:08.940
Heat's gotta go somewhere,right?

21:09.900 --> 21:12.220
He's been working that caring mentor
angle like there's no tomorrow.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.480
Uh-huh.

21:15.880 --> 21:16.760
You lost,my friend.

21:19.130 --> 21:20.140
Dutchy bailed out on me.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.110
What happened to you?

21:22.480 --> 21:23.920
Look, I told you I'd make another deal

21:23.930 --> 21:25.860
And give you the guys who
did San Marcos, and I will.

21:26.330 --> 21:29.430
No more deal. We can take care of
the San Marcos business ourselves.

21:29.450 --> 21:30.780
Rincon didn't do it.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.930
That's not what we hear.

21:31.950 --> 21:35.180
He's a poser. She shot off
his mouth for juice inside.

21:35.190 --> 21:37.840
He didn't kill those people or
he'd be sitting here right now

21:37.850 --> 21:38.890
Courtesy of me.

21:38.910 --> 21:39.920
Why should I believe you?

21:39.940 --> 21:41.790
'Cause I'm trying to
prevent more bloodshed.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.010
And I'd glad give up the assholes
who hacked up those people to do it.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.800
I have a lead about the real killers.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.650
You sit tight for a
day, forget about Rincon,

21:52.130 --> 21:53.310
And you'll get your justice.

21:55.610 --> 21:56.530
One day.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.670
After that, somebody's gonna pay.

21:59.140 --> 22:00.090
I don't give a shit who.

22:01.770 --> 22:02.590
Feel safer now?

22:06.030 --> 22:07.840
Vic get the names of his accomplices?

22:08.830 --> 22:09.680
Yeah.

22:13.220 --> 22:14.340
These names better check out.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.600
They will. So when do I get out of here?

22:16.620 --> 22:17.730
Answers first.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.820
How'd you kill those
people at San Marcos?

22:20.830 --> 22:23.630
Something big's coming up. I
didn't get too much details.

22:23.650 --> 22:25.410
All I know is we were
cut out by the Mexicans

22:25.420 --> 22:26.860
And people are pissed off.

22:27.390 --> 22:28.440
Who ordered you to do it?

22:29.210 --> 22:29.960
Guardo.

22:30.230 --> 22:31.640
He said we were sending a message.

22:31.670 --> 22:33.620
Kill everybody in the
house jungle style.

22:34.290 --> 22:35.890
There's a dude by the name of romero.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.530
We were supposed to leave him alive.

22:37.550 --> 22:39.280
So you just cut off his arm.

22:39.660 --> 22:41.190
Know a guy named Cruz Pezuela?

22:41.830 --> 22:43.200
Nah. Don't know him.

22:43.210 --> 22:46.050
Ok. Stay put. It's gonna take
a while to get you sprung.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.400
How'd it go with Shane?

22:49.670 --> 22:50.980
Well,he wasn't too subtle

22:50.990 --> 22:52.920
About not wanting me to dig
deeper into the Armenians.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.880
What happens when we don't
give Santi his revenge?

22:56.890 --> 22:59.630
Hell breaks loose,
unless we can find a way

22:59.650 --> 23:01.350
To make claudette and
the Mexicans happy.

23:07.270 --> 23:08.060
Here he is.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.410
Rincon punked us.

23:12.430 --> 23:13.760
Our guy wasn't where he said he-

23:13.780 --> 23:15.640
Second guy was a no-show,too,

23:16.270 --> 23:18.040
But Ronnie sweet talked the sister.

23:18.050 --> 23:19.810
They're both getting sloshed
at a bar up the street.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.170
Let's go catch us some killers.

23:21.190 --> 23:22.290
I'll call for backup.

23:26.910 --> 23:29.170
Police! Everybody stay
right where you are.

23:35.610 --> 23:36.910
You. Take your glasses off.

23:44.780 --> 23:47.560
Damn! Not such a sweet
talker after all,huh?

23:59.040 --> 24:01.200
Hey. What happened to
staying at the motel?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.210
I needed a few things for my father.

24:06.550 --> 24:08.300
I was gonna go in only
for a minute,but...

24:09.720 --> 24:11.150
The door. I felt someone inside.

24:11.890 --> 24:13.220
Did you see anything?
Did you hear anything?

24:13.990 --> 24:14.910
Just the feeling.

24:15.470 --> 24:16.650
You think I'm paranoid?

24:16.660 --> 24:18.000
You'd be stupid not to be.

24:18.010 --> 24:19.320
I'll be right back,ok?

24:51.830 --> 24:53.420
Hey! Police! Stay where you are!

24:53.770 --> 24:54.780
Stay where you are right now!

24:56.770 --> 24:58.080
Come here.

24:59.430 --> 25:00.380
Let me tell you something.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.040
Rezian's behind bars,
so the port business

25:03.050 --> 25:04.790
And the dreams that go
with it went bye-bye.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.040
The only way you're gonna earn

25:06.060 --> 25:07.590
Is to fall in line with
Kesakian's daughter.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.890
She's in charge now.

25:09.750 --> 25:10.570
Spread the word.

25:28.750 --> 25:29.830
They know about my father.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.160
They wouldn't dare to do this otherwise.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.650
I busted Rezian accepting
an illegal shipment,

25:34.670 --> 25:36.860
So his port business won't be
up and running any time soon.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.960
Then these men need to
understand that they need me.

25:41.390 --> 25:44.300
Yeah. Rezian's gonna come
back kicking and screaming,

25:44.330 --> 25:46.740
So we need to find a way to keep
him behind bars for the long haul.

25:47.610 --> 25:49.370
He has a warrant, or the books.

25:49.390 --> 25:51.580
Yeah,and a star witness
who's not who she says she is.

25:52.670 --> 25:53.390
Don't worry.

25:54.190 --> 25:55.660
This is where I start earning my keep.

26:15.210 --> 26:16.110
Get up.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.610
Rincon being innocent is bullshit.

26:40.620 --> 26:41.470
You lied to me?

26:41.480 --> 26:44.060
Only way I could get him
to give up these 2 assholes.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.280
The good news is after 18
months of a long prosecution,

26:47.290 --> 26:48.790
You'll know exactly where to find him.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.700
Him later. I'll take what you got now.

27:26.630 --> 27:27.550
What's the good word?

27:29.850 --> 27:32.070
Don't tell me you haven't
reached the right people yet.

27:33.550 --> 27:34.990
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

27:35.860 --> 27:37.920
I tried,but it's not possible.

27:38.550 --> 27:39.490
Try harder.

27:39.870 --> 27:40.600
No.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.160
Well, I guess it's time the world knew

27:47.130 --> 27:48.460
Who your daughter really was.

27:49.590 --> 27:50.470
You won't do that.

27:50.490 --> 27:52.640
You won't say anything because
you want to still keep your job.

27:54.290 --> 27:55.490
You change your story now,

27:55.510 --> 27:57.970
It'll reveal how you
manipulated the circumstances

27:57.990 --> 28:01.440
Of my daughter's case, you'll
expose yourself as unethical.

28:01.460 --> 28:02.440
Ha ha ha ha.

28:02.910 --> 28:04.250
I've been accused of worse.

28:04.470 --> 28:06.980
No. This time you're gonna
verify it with your own words.

28:09.780 --> 28:12.680
Look, I tried to keep
up my part of the deal,

28:12.700 --> 28:16.780
But you've built a mountain
of bad will too high to climb.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.880
Good luck,detective.

28:32.090 --> 28:34.380
Wilshire division found 2
bodies in an alley off Pico.

28:34.950 --> 28:37.500
Well,at least Santi
remembered where to dump 'em.

28:41.210 --> 28:42.580
Wilshire sent over the pictures.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.860
They our 2 missing killers?

28:44.200 --> 28:45.380
Well,what's left of them.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.940
Their wallets were found in
a trash can down an alley.

28:47.950 --> 28:50.570
Our poking around must
have flushed 'em out.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.800
I would have preferred them
back here alive and talking.

28:52.810 --> 28:55.430
Wilshire's homicide
rate just went up by 2,

28:55.900 --> 28:57.600
But you still have one live murderer

28:57.620 --> 28:59.950
To trot in front of the cameras
right here in farmington.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.800
San Marcos is officially closed.

29:03.270 --> 29:03.920
Thank you.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.710
Well,we got the guys
who wielded the machetes,

29:06.730 --> 29:08.000
But not the guys who ordered it.

29:08.020 --> 29:10.170
You need me, I'll be digging into

29:10.190 --> 29:12.080
How aceveda's lap dog
fits into this puzzle.

29:15.730 --> 29:18.370
It's just a matter of time before
we find the murder weapon,Mason.

29:18.810 --> 29:19.990
I can't tell you anything.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.840
You won't. There's a fairly
significant difference.

29:22.860 --> 29:24.630
It's not a crime to like someone.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.600
It is if they don't like
you back and you kill 'em.

29:27.590 --> 29:30.310
Did Alan say he didn't
want to see you anymore?

29:33.030 --> 29:33.850
Alan...

29:35.620 --> 29:38.200
Mason,here's what we're dealing with.

29:38.970 --> 29:40.990
There are several people who
say you were hounding him.

29:41.010 --> 29:42.540
That's supported by the phone records.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.970
There was no forced entry, so
we know he knew his attacker,

29:44.980 --> 29:48.050
And you called him an
hour before he died.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.040
Now, if you could give us an alibi,

29:51.050 --> 29:52.620
But you don't seem to have one.

29:54.370 --> 29:55.970
I can't tell you anything.

29:57.430 --> 29:59.190
Please. I can't.

30:00.710 --> 30:02.080
Why doesn't he ask for a lawyer?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.110
What's the point?

30:03.540 --> 30:05.600
Then why hasn't he confessed?

30:06.890 --> 30:08.230
Well,you're the theorizer.

30:08.670 --> 30:09.550
You ask.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.790
Sucks about sofer not letting
you take a run at her killer.

30:16.180 --> 30:17.090
What do you mean?

30:17.560 --> 30:18.800
Oh, I shouldn't have said anything.

30:19.890 --> 30:21.560
We were gonna bring
you into interrogation,

30:21.830 --> 30:23.170
Give you a chance to show your stuff,

30:23.190 --> 30:25.180
But she wouldn't have it. Said
you didn't have the skills.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.260
Really?

30:27.690 --> 30:28.940
I guess it's understandable.

30:29.930 --> 30:30.840
Understandable?

30:30.870 --> 30:33.410
Well,sure. I mean, obviously
she's making a play for Hiatt.

30:33.820 --> 30:35.870
Him thinking you're a screwup
just makes you less of a threat.

30:37.390 --> 30:38.280
Sort of petty,

30:38.290 --> 30:40.590
But that poor guy can't
take his eyes off you,

30:40.600 --> 30:41.840
So what else is she gonna do?

30:44.170 --> 30:45.440
You think kevin's into me?

30:46.930 --> 30:48.630
I know he's definitely not into her.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.550
Oh, I don't know.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.690
I've seen 'em cozy a couple times.

30:53.860 --> 30:54.970
Look,I'm gonna stay out of it.

30:55.570 --> 30:57.180
So please, don't say anything to Danny

30:57.200 --> 30:58.380
'Cause she'll know it was me.

30:59.310 --> 31:00.120
Sure.

31:05.540 --> 31:06.420
You're safe here.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.850
Just gonna make sure
that Rezian understood

31:08.870 --> 31:09.950
His end of our conversation.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.100
Then we'll get you out of here.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.410
Turns out no Garine Essagian
works at Rezian's bakery.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.980
But the nice lady on the phone told me

31:21.990 --> 31:23.920
That Kesakian's daughter
diro helps out with the books

31:23.940 --> 31:24.890
From time to time.

31:30.190 --> 31:31.890
Sounds like Shane made a big bust today.

31:33.580 --> 31:35.140
On behalf of the department, thank you.

31:36.530 --> 31:37.510
I'm glad I could help.

31:37.530 --> 31:39.950
So what brings you to the united states?

31:40.250 --> 31:42.620
Opportunity. The weather.

31:42.630 --> 31:43.640
Your father?

31:47.210 --> 31:49.370
I hear Kesakian's in the hospital.

31:49.870 --> 31:50.590
I'm sorry.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.940
My father's a noble man.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.540
He's also the leader of
a bunch of brutal yahoos.

31:55.990 --> 31:57.270
Now,where do you fit into that?

31:57.280 --> 31:58.690
My father is a businessman.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.050
I just translate, keep the books.

32:01.550 --> 32:02.960
The real ones or the fake ones?

32:07.120 --> 32:09.960
Look,you seem like a very nice girl.

32:11.090 --> 32:12.620
I'm sure your intentions are good.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.020
Then why are we having
this conversation?

32:15.030 --> 32:16.800
Because you need a
friend in this department.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.070
Someone besides Shane vendrell.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.690
You ever heard of antwon mitchell?

32:23.570 --> 32:25.890
He was the leader of a black
gang called the one-Niners.

32:26.260 --> 32:28.160
Shane and he did some
business last year.

32:28.570 --> 32:29.550
Some heat came down

32:30.020 --> 32:32.300
And an innocent
14-year-old girl got killed.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.990
Now mitchell's spending the
rest of his life behind bars.

32:36.810 --> 32:38.250
That has nothing to do with anything.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.090
Shane's still under investigation,

32:40.100 --> 32:42.490
And so is everyone he
comes in contact with.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.220
I don't know what kind of arrangement

32:45.230 --> 32:46.480
You two have between you if any,

32:46.980 --> 32:47.830
But just know...

32:49.280 --> 32:50.320
When the chips fall,

32:51.280 --> 32:53.250
They always land on
Shane's side of the table.

32:53.620 --> 32:56.330
You need anything, diro, you call me.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.120
Hey! Hey!

33:09.830 --> 33:11.230
Hey,where you going?

33:11.250 --> 33:12.630
This is not going to work.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.180
That cop knows what's going on.

33:14.200 --> 33:14.980
Who?

33:15.480 --> 33:16.610
Detective Mackey.

33:18.390 --> 33:19.720
Hey,listen to me. Listen to me.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.140
Look,whatever he told you

33:21.940 --> 33:23.110
Was a fishing expedition.

33:23.130 --> 33:24.070
He doesn't know anything.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.210
He knew my name, who my father is.

33:26.220 --> 33:27.490
I can control him.

33:28.390 --> 33:30.120
I'll see you get compensation for today,

33:30.130 --> 33:31.530
And I thank you.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.630
But we cannot be partners.
I have to be careful.

33:33.650 --> 33:34.860
Hey,listen to me-

33:34.870 --> 33:36.210
Do not bother me again.

33:40.630 --> 33:42.850
Hey! What the hell
did you say to my c.I.?

33:43.910 --> 33:45.840
Who, Garine Essagian?

33:46.940 --> 33:48.440
Told her to stay the hell away from you,

33:48.450 --> 33:49.860
Same as I would any girl.

33:50.390 --> 33:51.700
She didn't concern you.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.030
If she's putting money
in your pocket, she does.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.660
You don't get to profit
off this place. Not anymore.

33:56.670 --> 33:58.140
We don't need you dragging us into

33:58.150 --> 34:00.050
Yet another vendrell shitpile special.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.220
You just stay out of my way.

34:03.060 --> 34:04.530
This'll all go a lot smoother

34:04.550 --> 34:05.920
I'm not looking for smooth.

34:06.390 --> 34:08.760
I'm looking to make you as
miserable as I possibly can

34:08.780 --> 34:09.790
,you gotta try harder.

34:09.810 --> 34:12.150
I've been working for you so
long, I got a high tolerance.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.320
Whatever you got going on
with, this broad it ends now.

34:14.340 --> 34:16.775
I want you out of farmington
and away from everyone in it.

34:16.810 --> 34:19.210
What are we, 5 days and
counting until that appeals panel

34:19.219 --> 34:20.460
Shoves your badge your ass?

34:20.790 --> 34:22.810
Tells you to find greener pastures?

34:22.830 --> 34:23.770
I'm not gong anywhere.

34:24.250 --> 34:26.080
There's no trap door this time, Vic.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.020
They got you boxed in.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.449
Stay away from the Kesakians.

34:31.020 --> 34:32.230
I'll stop by and say hi

34:32.239 --> 34:34.139
When you start your
security job in northridge.

34:34.770 --> 34:37.120
Meantime,I'm pulling my
request for a transfer.

34:37.489 --> 34:40.340
You're leaving, so I may as well stay.

34:51.320 --> 34:51.940
A man brought this in.

34:51.949 --> 34:53.480
Said he found it in
the bed of his pickup,

34:54.350 --> 34:56.989
Which was parked a block
from Alan's house last night.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.450
But you already knew that.

35:00.550 --> 35:01.790
We take this down to the lab,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.460
It's gonna come back with
your fingerprints on it.

35:03.770 --> 35:04.750
It's just a matter of time.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.420
My time.

35:06.470 --> 35:07.420
You said that before.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.670
Why don't you tell us what happened.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.700
Judge are always more
inclined to be lenient

35:11.710 --> 35:12.790
After you've confessed.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.260
You ever heard of progeria?

35:19.670 --> 35:21.500
It's a kind of disease,right?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.290
Only 40 kids in the world have it.

35:24.710 --> 35:27.390
I knew one, johnny wilcox.

35:27.890 --> 35:28.710
He was cool.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.480
Yeah,you get old really fast.

35:32.490 --> 35:34.060
You shrivel up. Get arthritis.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.370
He died when we were 12.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.720
Massive heart attack.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.070
Everyone thinks they have more time.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.870
I saw johnny when they took him
out of his house after he died.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.870
Just a tiny little bump under a sheet.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.460
Do you want to see Alan's body?

35:55.470 --> 35:56.580
We could take you down there.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.690
No. I just...

36:00.470 --> 36:01.480
I want to stay here.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.870
A good margarita on the rocks with salt.

36:07.310 --> 36:08.450
None of that blended shit.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.120
Jack. Neat.

36:10.140 --> 36:11.370
Ice is for pussies.

36:12.050 --> 36:14.230
Now a bad day, that's a vodka martini.

36:14.770 --> 36:16.600
Who says all cops are alcoholics,huh?

36:19.290 --> 36:20.470
And then there are days like this.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.530
So what's it gonna be?

36:22.190 --> 36:23.930
Definitely a 3 martini night.

36:27.370 --> 36:29.000
Hey,get me out of here.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.820
The deal was 2 for 1. Alive.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.820
Guess the Mexicans screwed
you by getting to 'em first.

36:34.830 --> 36:35.750
Tough luck.

36:47.190 --> 36:48.300
Glad you came up for air.

36:48.990 --> 36:51.710
Just in time to ID
The San Marcos suspect.

36:51.720 --> 36:55.240
He'll cooperate as soon as all
his property is returned to him.

36:55.260 --> 36:57.800
Oh,you mean the briefcase
with the 200 grand inside?

36:58.050 --> 37:00.000
I forgot to ask what
all that money was for.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.390
And he never has to answer that.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.000
Somebody chopped my arm off, getting
paid would be the last thing on my mind.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.810
Well,when you've lived
through that experience,

37:06.830 --> 37:08.260
We'll be interested in your comments.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.830
How do we expedite the
return of the money?

37:13.710 --> 37:15.750
Silent types always made me curious,

37:15.760 --> 37:16.930
So I did a little homework.

37:17.890 --> 37:20.340
I understand you went to
college with Cruz Pezuela.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.980
The guy hangs with an interesting crowd,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.540
Everything from government
officials to Mexican cons.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.060
What's that have to do with my client?

37:27.070 --> 37:27.860
I don't know yet...

37:29.470 --> 37:30.420
But I'm gonna find out.

37:31.910 --> 37:32.660
Let's go.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.270
You might have heard I'm out of here.

37:39.460 --> 37:40.930
They say I got 5 days left,

37:42.190 --> 37:43.710
And I'm gonna use every second of 'em

37:43.720 --> 37:44.930
To find out what's going on here.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.000
Why those people died and you didn't,

37:47.180 --> 37:48.220
Where that money was going,

37:48.860 --> 37:50.590
And what Pezuela's
angle is in all of this.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.970
Your suspect still here?

38:03.800 --> 38:04.720
He never asked to leave.

38:05.170 --> 38:07.390
He wants to sit in
interrogation all night,let him.

38:08.180 --> 38:09.650
Any fingerprints come
back on the statue?

38:10.820 --> 38:12.710
Uh,tomorrow morning.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.920
You look tired. You should go.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.170
If only.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.330
What do I have to do?

38:32.390 --> 38:33.800
Change is hard for everybody.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.080
You still need me.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.020
Hiatt,he's not gonna get it done.

38:37.030 --> 38:38.270
He'll have his chance.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.290
What,like today?

38:39.950 --> 38:41.790
He's a sheep,not a shepherd.

38:42.740 --> 38:44.050
You pushed him too fast.

38:44.360 --> 38:47.030
I solved this thing before
the quarterly stats were due.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.640
You gonna tell me that saving this place

38:48.650 --> 38:49.920
Doesn't earn me a spot here?

38:49.940 --> 38:51.150
Nothing that happened today

38:51.160 --> 38:52.740
Is gonna change what i
have to say to the panel.

38:53.530 --> 38:54.450
Forget the panel.

38:55.350 --> 38:56.490
You've gotta give me more time

38:56.510 --> 38:57.850
To get into the San Marcos thing,

38:57.860 --> 38:58.970
Pezeula's place in it.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.570
We have 3 murderers whose
only link was to guardo.

39:02.950 --> 39:04.330
He's either missing or dead.

39:05.490 --> 39:06.240
You're done.

39:09.090 --> 39:10.830
I can get to the truth of this thing.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.340
Maybe,but we'll never know.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.720
Because it's somebody else's job now.

39:27.180 --> 39:28.230
I'm going after Pezuela.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.950
I'm gonna dig up all the dirt
you two have been playing in,

39:30.970 --> 39:32.110
And I'm gonna bring both of you down.

39:32.130 --> 39:35.620
You use your last few hours here
any way you want to,detective.

39:37.270 --> 39:38.190
I'll bet at the end of it all,

39:38.210 --> 39:39.280
I'm gonna find out that it was you

39:39.290 --> 39:40.930
Who gave up Hernan's cover,too.

39:40.940 --> 39:41.990
Who's Hernan?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.310
Undercover I.C.E. Agent.

39:43.710 --> 39:45.080
Infiltrated the Salvadorans.

39:46.140 --> 39:48.330
He was on the verge of
giving us the San Marcos intel

39:48.350 --> 39:50.790
When word leaked that the
Salvadorans had a mole.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.550
Did you tell your good buddy Cruz

39:52.560 --> 39:54.890
About the undercover agent
working the Salvadorans?

39:55.160 --> 39:56.560
No. Sure you did.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.570
All I have to do is prove it.

40:55.780 --> 40:56.460
Good morning.

40:57.790 --> 40:58.570
How you doing?

40:59.830 --> 41:02.080
Never better. Actually, a little busy.

41:03.930 --> 41:06.150
So i've been doing some research,

41:06.170 --> 41:07.640
And it turns out there's a lot of people

41:07.650 --> 41:09.350
That are looking to hire former cops.

41:09.370 --> 41:12.830
You could be an investigator
for a law firm or a p.I.

41:14.280 --> 41:15.550
I know it's not what you want,

41:15.570 --> 41:16.580
But you'd be good at it.

41:17.150 --> 41:18.360
You could take care of the kids.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.160
Thanks for pulling this together.

41:21.170 --> 41:21.950
No probLem.

41:23.920 --> 41:24.830
Uh...

41:26.940 --> 41:30.400
I'm sorry...about
everything that's happened.

41:32.050 --> 41:33.030
I can't believe it.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.550
We have a probLem.

41:46.770 --> 41:47.460
Aceveda: what's that?

41:47.960 --> 41:49.760
I heard the cop who solved the murders

41:49.780 --> 41:50.720
Is being forced out.

41:50.870 --> 41:52.700
Mackey? That's been a long time coming.

41:53.330 --> 41:54.380
Can we do anything about it?

41:54.390 --> 41:55.440
No. That's done.

41:55.970 --> 41:57.840
Well, wouldn't it make more
sense for the community

41:57.850 --> 42:00.630
To keep good cops who
share our interests?

42:00.650 --> 42:01.880
That's not gonna happen.

42:01.900 --> 42:02.910
I'd like you to reconsider.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.950
There are plenty of
good cops in farmington,

42:04.960 --> 42:06.370
Despite your experience.

42:06.380 --> 42:07.230
Not like him.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.270
The department will be
better off without him

42:09.290 --> 42:10.620
And so will the community.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.390
You just have to trust me on that.

42:15.380 --> 42:18.180
The rest of what I promised
for your exploratory committee.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.200
I might take a few days to cash it.

42:33.300 --> 42:34.460
If you don't confess,

42:34.670 --> 42:36.530
We're gonna arrest you
solely on the evidence.

42:36.550 --> 42:38.290
You're going to jail.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.310
It really is just a matter of time.

42:49.870 --> 42:52.880
Sometimes I think if you
don't admit it to yourself,

42:53.330 --> 42:57.530
To me, what's gonna
happen isn't gonna happen.

42:59.140 --> 43:00.780
But some things are just inevitable

43:01.550 --> 43:04.390
Once certain forces are set in motion.

43:05.030 --> 43:06.340
Can't change it back.

43:06.870 --> 43:08.870
Yeah. It's done.

43:13.840 --> 43:17.700
If I tell you how it happened,

43:17.710 --> 43:18.990
How sorry I am,

43:19.780 --> 43:23.740
And that all I wanted was to love him...

43:26.370 --> 43:27.870
And be loved back,

43:29.620 --> 43:31.650
Can I stay here a while longer?

43:33.100 --> 43:35.190
Sure. Until we need the room.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.400
The second I leave
here, my life is over.

43:41.640 --> 43:42.720
Eat your breakfast.

43:52.570 --> 43:53.810
I told you,stay away.

43:53.820 --> 43:54.930
Just give me a minute.

43:55.900 --> 43:56.720
Ok?

43:58.850 --> 43:59.930
You checked out of the motel.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.060
They found out about
my father's illness.

44:03.440 --> 44:04.870
They will come again. I won't hide.

44:04.890 --> 44:07.760
I'll protect you. I already have.

44:09.090 --> 44:10.920
Is that what your friend
antwon mitchell thought?

44:12.200 --> 44:13.060
Antwon.

44:13.990 --> 44:15.000
I that what Vic told you?

44:16.750 --> 44:17.830
He told me many things.

44:19.110 --> 44:20.390
That a little girl got killed,

44:21.160 --> 44:22.500
That you are being investigated.

44:23.190 --> 44:24.200
Well,that's a crock of shit.

44:25.170 --> 44:27.060
Vic's been on iad's radar for years.

44:27.450 --> 44:29.110
He's being swept out as we speak.

44:30.630 --> 44:32.070
And that little girl was not my fault.

44:32.990 --> 44:34.310
He has no reason to lie to me.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.690
He has every reason to lie to you.

44:36.160 --> 44:36.970
He does.

44:37.510 --> 44:39.480
What'd he do,give you
a shoulder to cry on?

44:39.850 --> 44:41.190
Offer to lend a helping hand?

44:41.720 --> 44:43.810
He'll be reaching into your
pocketbook by next week.

44:43.830 --> 44:44.710
Like you?

44:46.320 --> 44:48.350
I need to be alone. Now please go.

44:48.360 --> 44:51.230
No. You're gonna believe me first.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.720
I'm better off on my own.

44:52.730 --> 44:54.010
You're gonna get killed without me.

44:55.620 --> 44:56.540
Look...

44:57.050 --> 44:58.550
I saved your life yesterday.

44:59.220 --> 45:00.360
I took down Rezian.

45:00.700 --> 45:01.690
I got him out of the way

45:01.710 --> 45:03.370
So that you could assume
the throne. That was me.

45:03.390 --> 45:04.430
I'll pay you more.

45:05.490 --> 45:06.960
Look, I risked my ass for you.

45:07.760 --> 45:08.970
My job.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.570
Now,that's not how this shit works.

45:11.590 --> 45:14.100
I'm sorry. Good-Bye!

45:14.120 --> 45:15.780
Go. I mean it. Go!

45:15.790 --> 45:17.330
Listen to me. Vic
stole from your father.

45:18.580 --> 45:19.660
The Armenian money trade?

45:19.870 --> 45:21.180
Got robbed a few years back?

45:21.190 --> 45:22.340
A few guys got killed?

45:22.350 --> 45:23.780
The money was never found?

45:24.420 --> 45:27.070
That was Vic. Him and his guys.

45:28.680 --> 45:30.050
And he asked me to be a part of it.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.650
When I said no, I became a threat.

45:36.580 --> 45:38.480
Vic's had a bull's-eye
on my back ever since.

45:43.560 --> 45:47.150
My father lost 6 months
of profit in that.

45:49.970 --> 45:51.700
Well, I guess you've had a
much better understanding

45:51.720 --> 45:53.510
Of your father's
dealings than you told me.

45:55.880 --> 45:58.230
Well,that's it. Full disclosure.

45:58.830 --> 46:01.870
Both of us. Now whose
side do you want to be on?

46:03.840 --> 46:05.190
I'm gonna have to deal with him,too.

46:05.630 --> 46:06.450
Who,Vic?

46:07.410 --> 46:09.040
Wait a second. I didn't tell you that-

46:09.050 --> 46:11.010
But you have told me,
and you were right before.

46:11.710 --> 46:13.060
I must finish the job.

46:13.690 --> 46:15.000
There is no middle ground.

46:22.550 --> 46:24.250
The mayor come crying
back to you already?

46:24.530 --> 46:26.490
That happened faster
than I thought it would.

46:27.130 --> 46:28.990
Congratulations on solving the murders.

46:29.010 --> 46:30.690
Thank you, but I'm not finished.

46:31.410 --> 46:32.600
Couldn't have done it without my tip.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.510
Or at least not as fast.

46:35.210 --> 46:36.450
Stop turning over rocks.

46:36.470 --> 46:38.620
Not until I find out
what's crawling underneath.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.590
Yeah, I was just telling aceveda

46:42.600 --> 46:44.590
How much this city needs cops like you.

46:45.420 --> 46:46.800
He doesn't see it that way.

46:47.590 --> 46:48.410
Not yet.

46:48.420 --> 46:49.300
Not ever.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.620
Yeah,you can keep wasting my time.

46:55.630 --> 46:56.840
I'm gonna have plenty of it.

46:58.420 --> 46:59.600
I can get you your job back.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.020
I had a city controller trying
to save my job, and he owed me.

47:03.460 --> 47:04.930
He has 10 times the juice you have

47:04.940 --> 47:06.090
And he got nothing done.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.450
He has 10 times the juice,

47:09.930 --> 47:11.440
But I have one more picture.

47:25.690 --> 47:26.630
That's aceveda.

47:28.250 --> 47:29.300
Where did you get this?

47:30.980 --> 47:31.900
When was it taken?

47:32.750 --> 47:34.420
Gun to his head.

47:34.660 --> 47:37.670
Rather than stand up like
a man to his attackers,

47:37.680 --> 47:38.690
He gets on his knees

47:39.360 --> 47:40.840
And takes a man's dick in his mouth.

47:44.010 --> 47:45.880
Don't think that'll play
too well with the voters.

47:47.590 --> 47:49.190
Except maybe in west hollywood.

47:50.060 --> 47:51.080
Use it any way you want,

47:51.510 --> 47:53.080
So long as it doesn't come back to me.

47:55.610 --> 47:56.490
Save your job...

47:59.050 --> 47:59.970
But stop digging.

48:00.930 --> 48:01.740
Right now.
