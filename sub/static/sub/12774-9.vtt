10:35.235 --> 10:37.304
What the fuck did I do?
What the fuck was that?

10:39.873 --> 10:41.709
You shot him!

10:41.775 --> 10:43.010
He was supposed
to be dead.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.411
Why did you do that?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.246
He was supposed to be dead,
I did the fucking paperwork.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.015
(GROANING)

10:48.816 --> 10:49.883
Ow.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.453
Oh, what...
What the fuck?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.623
(GRUNTS)

10:58.358 --> 11:01.561
Is everything all right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:01.628 --> 11:03.831
Oh, everything
is more than okay.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.365
Accident,
though it may have been,

11:05.432 --> 11:07.134
our fine detective
may have just proved

11:07.200 --> 11:11.304
that our young friend
cannot be killed.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.942
I'm going to win
a Nobel Prize.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.213
I'm a dad.
Me, can you believe it?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.681
I'm a dad.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.050
DR. MARRS: Vitals are normal.

11:24.752 --> 11:25.953
Ow.
Oh!

11:26.019 --> 11:27.654
Pain response is normal.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.889
This is so good.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.092
And I'm out of here.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.728
DR. MARRS: Oh, no, no, no,
Doctor, I need you to
confirm my findings.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.099
Again, I'm sorry
for shooting you.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.068
No, I get it.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.803
(SCREAMS)

11:42.870 --> 11:44.071
What? What?
Whoa, whoa.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.438
Oh.
Get it! Get it!

11:45.505 --> 11:46.807
What's wrong with him?
DEENA: I don't know.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.675
He'll be okay,
he's just not seen a...

11:48.742 --> 11:51.078
What's happening now?
He's having a seizure.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.013
He needs to get
to a hospital.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.347
What is wrong with him?
I don't know,

11:54.414 --> 11:56.784
I can only tell you
after he dies and I
open him up.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.518
Mmm-mmm.

11:58.585 --> 11:59.820
(COUGHS)
I'm fine.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.822
You are not fine.
I'm okay.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.690
DR. MARRS: When was
the last time you slept?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.158
Have you eaten
anything today?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.060
Do you have
blood sugar issues?

12:07.127 --> 12:09.763
Have you had any contact
with an active Power?

12:09.830 --> 12:13.000
Active Powers are all we've
been in contact with.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
Well, there you go.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.170
There goes who?
What?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.206
It'll be in
my next report to you.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.909
Every single Power
that we have contact with

12:21.975 --> 12:24.411
is technically,
if you think about it,

12:24.477 --> 12:26.313
a biological hazard.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.748
This room alone
is filled with dead Powers.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.483
A Power that returned
from the dead,

12:30.550 --> 12:32.752
and an ex-Power.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.855
I mean, there's just still
so much we don't understand.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.756
There's so much
that we don't know.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.259
I think that there should be
regular check-ups

12:39.326 --> 12:42.162
of all Powers Division
personnel.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.396
We don't know
how this environment

12:43.463 --> 12:46.666
is affecting our
biological machines.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.435
(SCOFFS)

12:49.837 --> 12:51.771
Well, I'm fine.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.141
You can stop
staying that, 'cause...

12:54.207 --> 12:57.344
How many times has
this happened?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.712
It's not a number
you'd be happy with.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.615
Okay, you're going
to see a doctor.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.052
A real, living
person's doctor.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.319
I'm good.
Thank you.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.654
Hey, hey, hey.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.157
That's an order.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.225
(EXHALES)

13:13.360 --> 13:14.494
I'm on him.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.431
Come on Craig,
this is the best you can do?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.100
CRAIG: You wanted
quick cash, right?

13:20.167 --> 13:22.269
This is what you do
for quick cash.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.437
Signing headshots
for collector fuckheads?

13:24.504 --> 13:25.906
What the fuck?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.574
(GRUNTS) Hold on, Diamond.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.708
Sure.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.577
This is cold.
Can I have a hot coffee?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.079
Thank you.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.815
Diamond, listen,
show business is hills
and valleys.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.218
I'm not in show
business, okay?

13:38.285 --> 13:39.752
I'm a... I'm a Power.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.023
I was...a fucking Power.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.424
Don't kid yourself,
Diamond,

13:44.491 --> 13:46.026
you're in show business.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.660
Listen, yes, this sucks.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.897
This is what it feels like
to be on the balls
of your ass.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.564
But you'll get it back.
You will.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.333
You'll get your powers back.
Bills to fucking pay, and...

13:53.400 --> 13:55.468
Hey, I'm your biggest fan.
Shit.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.871
It's the easiest money,
someone like you can make.
Fuck.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.272
Walker?
Fuck.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.108
Walker?
You still there?

14:01.174 --> 14:02.775
Walker?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.912
Listen, you need to
get to a hospital.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.448
(WALKER SIGHS)
Before something

14:08.515 --> 14:10.984

happens to you.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.188
You hearing me
with this?

14:15.255 --> 14:16.589
(SIGHS)

14:17.090 --> 14:18.791
(PANTING)

14:20.193 --> 14:21.895
Okay, I promise you
I'll go.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.863
Just not
right now, okay?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.766
There's too
much going on.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.202
Is Kutter okay?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.106
Kutter is...is bad.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.276
Kutter's very bad.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.181
Are you okay?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.183
No.
(STAMMERS) If people are

14:43.250 --> 14:46.319
going to start
rising from the dead,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.021
that's going to be a problem
for us, too, so...

14:48.088 --> 14:49.556
Okay, okay.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.160
We slayed the dragon.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.661
That is all that matters.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.697
Are we good, with this?
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.066
Okay.
Yeah.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.269
I can take your
mind off of it.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.836
Please.
Yeah?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.239
Yeah.
Okay, you ready for this?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.944
Supershock
killed the Senator.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.380
(LAUGHS)

15:15.382 --> 15:18.285
(STUTTERING) Is that
how far into Crazy Town
we are now,

15:18.351 --> 15:21.421
that that might be good news?
Hey, listen to me, okay?

15:21.488 --> 15:23.156
It's Morrison.
I...he... I...

15:23.223 --> 15:24.624
Morrison stabbed Kutter.
Morrison does not exist.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.093
Morrison is the one
who we're looking for

15:26.159 --> 15:27.560
because you started
looking for him.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.728
I've looked in
Supershock's eyes.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.030
I don't care about his eyes.
And I found...

15:30.097 --> 15:31.131
What evidence do you have?
Any evidence at all.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.300
I found this.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.534
What?

15:35.969 --> 15:37.904
It's a letter
from Janice

15:37.971 --> 15:39.606
warning us of this day.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.309
What the fuck is this?
You don't have this
in an evidence bag.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.643
Well, I didn't know
what it was at the time,

15:43.710 --> 15:45.145
I was recovering from a coma.
Your fingerprints

15:45.212 --> 15:47.047
are all over this,
my fingerprints

15:47.114 --> 15:48.215
are all over this.
My fingerprints?

15:48.281 --> 15:49.582
I will...
I didn't mean it...

15:49.649 --> 15:51.584
Fuck, it's fucked
as evidence, Walker.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.153
Fucked evidence of what?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.354
Fuller?
Yep?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.156
You got anything?
Working on it.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.825
Type faster.
Fucked as evidence of what?

15:58.891 --> 16:00.260
Well, here you go.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.331
It is Morrison.
It is not Supershock.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.033
It is Morrison.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.234
Supershock?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.902
Yeah.
Seizure boy here...

16:09.969 --> 16:11.538
...thinks that...
Is sure.

16:11.604 --> 16:15.008
Is sure, is sure
that Supershock is insane,

16:15.075 --> 16:17.944
and he killed the Senator,
because someone wrote a, uh,

16:18.011 --> 16:20.580
"To whom it may concern"
letter.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.915
Because
Janice wrote it.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.619
She did.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.522
If a Power at this level
is taking the law

16:29.589 --> 16:30.990
into his own hands,

16:32.525 --> 16:34.094
what the fuck
do we do?

16:38.665 --> 16:39.999
(LOUD CRASH)

16:45.572 --> 16:47.474
Oh, shit.
Fuck me.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.978
What happened?
You see what happened?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.246
MAN: No, I don't know.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.947
Fuck me.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.452
She alive?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.721
Fuck.
She's dead.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.523
So what,
do you think she crashed?

17:03.590 --> 17:06.093
Well, she didn't jump.
Nothing high enough.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.696
So it's crazy windy today,
maybe she lost control and...

17:09.762 --> 17:11.564
Maybe she was thrown.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.665
What?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.268
See the cloud formation?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.437
DEENA: Yeah.
It's disturbed.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.540
Maybe there was a fight.
Something disturbed it.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.844
She was thrown.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.334
I'm sorry.
Fifty.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.136
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back,

17:49.202 --> 17:51.638
I just, uh,
(STAMMERS) I didn't know
what to say.

CROSS: How about,
"Hi, I'm not dead."

17:54.174 --> 17:56.309
I don't know what to say
to anyone anymore, Emile.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.311
Imagine my surprise...

17:59.879 --> 18:02.415
...when I found
this in the corner

18:02.482 --> 18:04.217
of a double homicide
crime scene.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.318
Oh, shit.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.019
Seems a hooker
pissed off her pimp,

18:07.086 --> 18:08.955
things ended badly
for all parties involved.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.423
Do you know anything
about that?

18:10.490 --> 18:11.624
'Cause it's
a pretty funny place

18:11.691 --> 18:13.593
to find such an important
part of you.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.094
She stole it from me.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.765
I don't want
to talk about it, Emile.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.533
It's...it's embarrassing.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.235
Okay.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.571
The case is closed.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.039
Thought, you know, you might
like your uniform back.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.710
This is not
my uniform anymore.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.615
You fancy a new one?

18:38.017 --> 18:39.786
What?
You remember when Diamond

18:39.852 --> 18:42.355
would bring me those
great leads all the time?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.624
You made me look pretty
good to my superiors.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.259
You helped me a lot.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.794
We helped each other.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.863
Now we can help
each other even more,

18:50.930 --> 18:53.633
because I took some of
the good will fairy dust

18:53.700 --> 18:55.268
that you sprinkled
on my head,

18:55.335 --> 19:00.039
and I deftly worked
some bureaucratic magic,

19:00.106 --> 19:03.343
and the city is seriously
considering opening up

19:03.410 --> 19:05.978

19:06.045 --> 19:07.380

19:07.447 --> 19:09.549

working cases...

19:09.616 --> 19:11.484
Yeah, I understand
what you mean.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.555

Interesting idea.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.491
The only thing missing
is a star detective.

19:22.195 --> 19:25.131
Emile, I'm not exactly a star.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.433
And you're
no detective.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.867
You're going to have to
go through the paces.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.436
You're going to have
to earn your way in,

19:29.502 --> 19:31.204
but we need you.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.340
They need you.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.408
Who down
here understands

19:35.475 --> 19:38.010
what goes on up there
better than you?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.448
So swap this

19:41.514 --> 19:45.318
for a shirt and a tie
and a gun and a badge.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.455
With your deep contacts,
your intuitive understanding

19:48.521 --> 19:51.157
of what goes on
in that world,

19:51.224 --> 19:54.561
you can help a unique
department in a unique way.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.398
I'm going to be really blunt
with you, Christian.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.667
I think losing your powers

20:00.733 --> 20:02.769
was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.438
You don't know who you are,
because you had those powers

20:05.505 --> 20:07.206
to hide behind.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.242

DEENA: Isn't this the same one
who Calista messed up

20:30.763 --> 20:32.465
at her big debut
at the funeral?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.735
Yeah, Rainbow.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.837
Ooh, out of the way,
detectives.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.072
Oh, hi.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.309
Well, maybe her powers
gave out on her.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.143
Uh, these are contusions.

There's no, uh,
there's no fist inputs,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.085
there's no hand marks.

20:53.152 --> 20:56.255
High-level Powers
don't need fists or kicks.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.891
They're not regular marks.
Uh, I was a Power.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.393
I left marks.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.794
You were a...a seven.

21:01.861 --> 21:02.929
I'm talking higher.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.497
Sometimes when
a higher power

21:04.564 --> 21:05.798
hits a lower power,
they leave

21:05.865 --> 21:08.401
really interesting contusions
and marks.

If Powers are rising
from the dead,

21:29.188 --> 21:30.323
I want to get out
in front of it.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.392
Oh, it was...
It was just that one.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.061

We have seven

33:20.666 --> 33:23.169
* I found disillusion

33:23.235 --> 33:24.636
Come see.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.972
Hands in the air.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.678
* But I discovered

33:32.744 --> 33:34.346
Come.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.682
* This

33:39.285 --> 33:44.022
* That birds are
the first love

33:44.090 --> 33:45.524
See?

33:47.226 --> 33:48.927
You're just in time.

33:48.994 --> 33:51.763
* And you,
you were my... *

33:51.830 --> 33:54.900
Front row seat
to the fall of God.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.710
We're looking for Calista,
is she here?

34:09.648 --> 34:11.250
Calista!

34:11.317 --> 34:13.152
What happened?

34:13.219 --> 34:14.986
ZORA: Oh, my God, Calista,
were you attacked?

34:19.625 --> 34:21.093
He tried to kill me.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.363
What?
Why?

34:24.430 --> 34:26.932
He kept calling me Janice.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.901
He's looking for someone
called Morrison.

34:29.968 --> 34:31.603
He thinks
we're hiding him.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.741
Everyone I've ever loved

34:37.042 --> 34:38.944
has died in my arms.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.614
No one remembers
I ever existed.

34:43.715 --> 34:47.653
And my great shame is...

34:47.719 --> 34:51.390
I was never able
to really beat him.

34:54.226 --> 34:57.062
But staying alive long enough
to watch him fall,

34:58.797 --> 35:00.899
and by his own hand,
no less.

35:02.201 --> 35:07.439
That makes it all
almost worthwhile.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.110
Was it worth
stabbing my friend,
you sick fuck?

35:12.178 --> 35:13.479
Hold on.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.716
(EXPLOSION)

35:17.783 --> 35:18.884
Ah.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.088
There it is.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.991
(EXPLOSION)

35:27.226 --> 35:28.994
(CLAPPING)

35:32.264 --> 35:33.299
(SIGHS)

35:36.335 --> 35:38.537
You didn't see it,
did you?

35:38.604 --> 35:41.507
You can't see him up there,
flying around

35:41.573 --> 35:43.475
like a little,
lost puppy.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.647
I told him,
"I don't know who
Morrison is,"

35:49.448 --> 35:50.949
and he grabbed me.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.253
(GASPS)
No, no!

35:54.320 --> 35:57.389
(STAMMERS) I didn't think
it was going to be like this.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.591
(YELPING)
You're not going anywhere.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.594
(SHAKILY) I wanted
my powers so bad.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.530
I want Morrison now!
(STRUGGLING, PANTING)

36:04.596 --> 36:06.965
But I... I didn't think
it was going to be like...

36:07.032 --> 36:08.434
How did you get away?

36:11.403 --> 36:15.040
I never thought Supershock
would try to kill me.

36:16.275 --> 36:20.011
Ms. Secor,
where is he now?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.181
I didn't know
where to go.

36:23.249 --> 36:25.351
(SOBBING) I didn't...
I didn't know where to hide.

36:25.417 --> 36:30.256
I came here 'cause I...
I don't want to do
this anymore.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.791
I... I... I don't want
to have these powers.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.193
I... I don't.
I don't want them.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.895
I don't want them.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.703
It's a good day.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.672
Stand up,
put your hands on your head.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.940
You're under arrest.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.876
I know that look.
(SIGHS)

36:50.942 --> 36:54.813
You want to kill me,
but you're not allowed.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.615
Mmm-hmm.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.054
Is your little
friend dead?

37:05.657 --> 37:07.393
Did he bleed on you?

37:11.029 --> 37:14.633
Do I have the right
to remain silent?

37:15.901 --> 37:17.536
(SHUDDERING BREATH)

37:17.603 --> 37:18.804
(SHIVERING)

37:25.311 --> 37:28.947
Babe, babe, you have to come
out of there, okay?

37:29.014 --> 37:32.718
You don't understand
what this was like.

37:32.784 --> 37:33.985
WALKER: I do.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.927
I'm thinking
it felt something like

37:41.993 --> 37:44.062
when Wolfe attacked me.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.832
You know, I, uh,
admired him so much.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.935
He was like
a father to me.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.236
Next thing I knew...

37:51.303 --> 37:52.604
(SNAPS)

37:52.671 --> 37:53.839
(SCOFFS) Sinking his
teeth in my back,

37:53.905 --> 37:55.240
he's trying to kill me.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.810
A lot of
people died today.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.314
A lot of good,
talented Powers,

38:02.381 --> 38:05.351
but not you.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.519
You did something
none of the others could.

38:07.586 --> 38:08.787
You got away.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.088
(SCOFFS)

38:10.155 --> 38:11.357
I ran away.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.058
No, you flew away,

38:13.659 --> 38:14.893
like a Power,

38:14.960 --> 38:17.095
but now there are people
that need your help.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.164
Your fellow
Powers need you.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.467
I can't.
I... I can't.

38:21.533 --> 38:24.903
Calista, I would give anything
to have my powers back

38:24.970 --> 38:27.005
and get out there
and stop this,

38:28.139 --> 38:30.376
but I don't have them.
I never will.

38:31.677 --> 38:32.711
We need you.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.513
I can't!

38:34.580 --> 38:37.816
Maybe you can't do it alone,
but you're not alone.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.351
She's right,

38:39.418 --> 38:41.019
and I shouldn't have
turned my back on you, okay?

38:41.086 --> 38:43.889
You need my help,
I'm going to help you.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.424
The more I think about it,
the more I think that

38:45.491 --> 38:47.225
everything
that happened to you,

38:47.292 --> 38:49.728
everything that happened
to all of us,

38:49.795 --> 38:51.397
happened for a reason.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.964
All the pain,
all the bullshit

38:53.031 --> 38:54.232
we've been through.

38:54.299 --> 38:57.202
The fighting, the agony,
the killing, the death.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.505
All of it has led up
to this moment,

38:59.571 --> 39:03.375
right now, right here,
for us to stand together

39:03.442 --> 39:05.544
and face this crazy
motherfucker.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.152
(ELECTRICITY POWERING DOWN)

39:32.103 --> 39:33.572
(METAL CLANKING)

39:35.073 --> 39:37.643
I think
I broke your lock.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.747
Um, I'll... I'll pay
to get that fixed.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.115
(SIGHS)

39:45.651 --> 39:46.785
Okay.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.487
We're ready.

39:48.554 --> 39:49.788
Let's do this.
Let's stop him.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.590
I would like to help.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.796
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.039
(CHUCKLES)

Uh, don't laugh at me,
but I think I might be a...

40:21.887 --> 40:23.088
I'm a Power.

40:23.689 --> 40:24.890
(LAUGHS)

40:26.792 --> 40:31.597
So, how do we kill
the highest level Power ever?

40:31.663 --> 40:33.732
I'm worried about sending
these young Powers out there

40:33.799 --> 40:36.434
without something
resembling a plan.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.504
DEENA: We give him
something he wants.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.840
Everybody meet Morrison.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.342
Morrison, everybody.
