00:03.150 --> 00:08.380


02:27.430 --> 02:29.190
Can't believe it. They're right on time.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.650
Let's get these boys to their party.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.960
Mama!

03:24.200 --> 03:26.910
<i>It's 10:48 on Fat Tuesday, Mardi Gras-</i>

03:26.990 --> 03:29.710
<i>Now let's go back in time to 1964-</i>

03:29.790 --> 03:32.710
<i>The Beach Boys on 105-3 FM,</i>

03:33.040 --> 03:35.460
<i>the heart of New Orleans-</i>

04:00.360 --> 04:03.360
Okay. Take it out wide.
Give the pig some room.

06:52.780 --> 06:56.580
My daughter's on that ferry.
Please. Please.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.120
Oh, God, my daughter!

08:04.100 --> 08:05.690
Do the other side?

09:02.660 --> 09:04.290
ATF New Orleans, Agent Donnelly.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.540
Listen, call New Orleans PD.

09:06.670 --> 09:08.960
I want all surveillance
from the Algiers dock.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.420
Then call City Transit.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.720
I want
the Crescent City Bridge surveillance,

09:12.840 --> 09:14.470
<i>westbound between 10:00 and 11:00-</i>

09:14.590 --> 09:15.630
All right, got it.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.840
Hey. Seen an ATF agent around here?

09:58.970 --> 10:00.430
Yeah, he went down below.

10:01.430 --> 10:02.520
How do I get there?

10:02.640 --> 10:04.480
The south side of the bridge.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.030
You Agent Minuti?

10:14.400 --> 10:16.150
Larry Minuti, ATF?

10:16.530 --> 10:18.990
No, Larry's my partner.
I'm Doug Carlin.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.910
Paul Pryzwarra, FBI.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.040
-How you doing?
-Where's Minuti?

10:23.330 --> 10:24.410
On vacation.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.080
Not anymore. We're calling in
half the region on this one.

10:28.620 --> 10:29.830
You can reach him?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.550
I tried. He's not picking up his phone.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.010
Well, try harder. It's important.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.630
Obviously.

10:39.010 --> 10:40.800
What are you looking for?

10:41.010 --> 10:42.890
Anything that doesn't belong.

10:46.430 --> 10:48.480
You want to give me a spot?

10:49.560 --> 10:50.810
Yeah.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.450
ANFO.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.500
Ammonium nitrate, water-soluble.

11:07.620 --> 11:10.250
Fuel oil would have burnt off
during the blast.

11:10.540 --> 11:11.000
Between the river and the rain,
if ANFO was used,

11:10.960 --> 11:12.540
Between the river and the rain,
if ANFO was used,

11:12.670 --> 11:13.840
the only place you'd find it would be...

11:13.960 --> 11:15.750
Underneath this bridge.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.670
That's right.

11:18.380 --> 11:20.510
We can't rule out an accident
at this point.

11:20.630 --> 11:22.850
-It's not officially a crime scene yet.
-Here's a thought.

11:22.970 --> 11:24.010
Why don't we double the perimeter

11:24.140 --> 11:25.930
so we don't have wall-to-wall trailers
down there?

11:26.060 --> 11:27.520
No, we're gonna need
all our manpower

11:27.640 --> 11:29.440
for evidence control
and witness processing.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.770
Now, we need to keep it tight

11:30.900 --> 11:33.190
until we can determine
that it is a crime investigation.

11:33.310 --> 11:35.020
It is a crime investigation.

11:35.150 --> 11:36.780
Got a piece of electric blasting cap

11:36.900 --> 11:38.780
and a strand
of what appears to be leg wire.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.660
About a million of those blue particles
washed up on the Algiers side.

11:44.780 --> 11:47.290
It's probably from
a plastic container or a barrel.

11:47.580 --> 11:48.620
ANFO?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.460
Most likely.
There was post-blast residue

11:50.580 --> 11:52.460
under the Crescent City Bridge.

11:52.580 --> 11:55.130
The insulation on the leg wire
will inform us

11:55.250 --> 11:57.590
of who the manufacturer
of the blasting cap is.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.300
Then we go after
the switching mechanism

11:59.420 --> 12:00.880
and the bomb's power source.

12:01.010 --> 12:03.930
We probably don't need to wait for
the lab to tell us what we already know,

12:04.050 --> 12:06.100
that this is an explosive and a trigger.

12:06.430 --> 12:07.680
And you are?

12:07.810 --> 12:10.060
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Doug Carlin, ATF.

12:10.180 --> 12:11.810
-Who's in charge?
-We're working on that now.

12:11.940 --> 12:12.980
Gentlemen, please.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.980
Ed Elkins. I'm in charge.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.150
-Oh, good, good, good.
-Yeah.

12:16.270 --> 12:17.820
You're in charge, then? Okay.

12:18.110 --> 12:19.990
First things first.
Where's the coffeepot?

12:20.110 --> 12:21.150
Ed?

12:21.860 --> 12:24.070
Come on, this is a police investigation,
right? Operation.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.830
We gotta have a coffeepot.

12:25.950 --> 12:27.950
Yeah, you'll find it in the back.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.120
-Back there?
-Yeah.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.080
He is in charge. Thank you, gentlemen.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.020
See anything?

12:56.150 --> 12:57.440
Traffic.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.320
Hit rewind for me.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.400
Hey, did Larry call?

13:01.530 --> 13:03.490
Still not answering his cell.
We left another message.

13:03.610 --> 13:04.610
All right.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.870
-Say, that girl ever get ahold of you?
-What girl?

13:06.990 --> 13:09.450
You know, sexy voice, asked if
you were tall, dark and handsome.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.580
I gave her two out of three.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.200
Two out of three. That's very good.
Hit play.

13:12.330 --> 13:13.620
Thank you.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.500
Hey, Larry, this is Doug.
How you doing?

13:20.630 --> 13:22.470
Listen, I know you're maybe still
pissed off at me,

13:22.590 --> 13:24.220
but you need to
get your behind down here, all right?

13:24.340 --> 13:25.430
-Doug.
-Yeah?

13:25.550 --> 13:27.720
Doug, Orleans Parish on line one.
It's Sheriff Reed.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.060
They pulled a body out of the water,
and they want a profile.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.770
All right,
tell him they don't need a profile.

13:31.890 --> 13:34.730
-Just tell him to bag it. I'll call him back.
-Okay, got it.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.230
Put this on a candy wrapper?

13:38.360 --> 13:39.570
It's all I had.

13:39.690 --> 13:41.610
Cutting back, huh?

13:43.440 --> 13:45.200
Hold it right there.

13:47.030 --> 13:50.330
Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug Carlin
returning your call.

13:50.450 --> 13:53.580
My cell number is 504-555-0130.

13:54.330 --> 13:55.500
What's that?

13:55.620 --> 13:57.040
Looks like a dude on a bike.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.250
Run it forward a little bit.

14:01.130 --> 14:02.590
Stop right there.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.260
What is he doing?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.260
Going to the bathroom?

14:14.640 --> 14:16.940
Run it forward, run it forward.

14:21.150 --> 14:23.730
-What time does it say?
-10:47.

14:23.860 --> 14:27.280
-That's before the explosion, isn't it?
-Right before.

14:29.820 --> 14:32.660
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>
<i>Thanks very much for coming-</i>

14:32.790 --> 14:36.910
<i>I'm Jack McCready, special agent</i>
<i>in charge of this investigation-</i>

14:37.500 --> 14:39.540
<i>First, let me say our hearts go out</i>

14:39.670 --> 14:42.040
<i>to all of those affected by this tragedy-</i>

14:44.170 --> 14:46.630
<i>Early estimates</i>
<i>place the number of casualties</i>

14:46.760 --> 14:50.720
<i>at 543 men, women and children-</i>

14:51.680 --> 14:54.390
<i>Now, Lord knows this city has seen</i>
<i>its share of pain,</i>

14:54.470 --> 14:56.230
<i>but unlike Katrina,</i>

14:56.890 --> 14:59.230
<i>this disaster was not an act of nature-</i>

15:00.520 --> 15:02.980
<i>After careful review of evidence</i>
<i>retrieved at the scene,</i>

15:03.110 --> 15:06.570
<i>we have concluded</i>
<i>this was a deliberate act of terrorism,</i>

15:07.360 --> 15:10.070
<i>and the President concurs</i>
<i>with our assessment-</i>

15:10.200 --> 15:12.780
<i>On our end,</i>
<i>we have to ask for your patience,</i>

15:12.910 --> 15:14.660
<i>as the investigation will take time-</i>

15:14.790 --> 15:18.500
<i>It's a unique and complicated</i>
<i>crime scene-</i>

15:18.620 --> 15:22.170
<i>There's no baggage checks-</i>
<i>There's no flight data recorder-</i>

15:22.590 --> 15:24.170
<i>There are maximum casualties,</i>

15:24.300 --> 15:27.970
<i>and most of the evidence</i>
<i>is under 100 feet of muddy water-</i>

15:29.550 --> 15:31.300
<i>There are no shortcuts-</i>

15:33.890 --> 15:35.890
-Kevin, where's Doug?
-You just missed him.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.140
-Well, his car's still here.
-Took the streetcar.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.480
-What? Streetcar?
-Hey, don't look at me.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.610
It's part of his process.
He says it helps him think.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.280
Sheriff Reed.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.870
How you doing?
It's Doug Carlin returning your call.

15:53.990 --> 15:56.330
Hey, Doug. I know you got
your hands full right now.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.660
Yeah, that's okay.
What do you got for me, Bob?

15:58.790 --> 16:00.750
Well, a couple of kids found a woman

16:00.870 --> 16:02.750
face down in the waters
off Algiers Point.

16:05.420 --> 16:08.170
Right, well, you're gonna see
a lot of that over the next few weeks.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.590
We've just set up ECC.
Just have Crime Scene bag it for us.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.260
<i>Well, we already done that-</i>
<i>The body's at the ME's right now-</i>

16:14.390 --> 16:15.600
Crime Scene's already been there?

16:15.720 --> 16:17.310
<i>Yeah, they've been and gone-</i>

16:17.430 --> 16:19.180
Well, exactly what time
did this woman wash up on shore?

16:22.600 --> 16:25.820
Kid called it in at 10:42 a.m.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.610
You mean 11:42, don't you?

16:28.730 --> 16:31.740
No, I mean 10:42.
I got the sheet right in front of me,

16:32.070 --> 16:34.370
and I got my reading glasses on.

16:38.870 --> 16:42.750
Immediately evident is the
focal charring of the limbs and torso.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.920
Anterior face, neck and chest
are intact,

16:48.340 --> 16:51.340
though swollen
from apparent immersion in water.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.600
Hold her hand for me, will you?
Right here.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.270
Hold her hand for me, will you?
Right here.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.020
There we go.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.860
Each digit of the right hand
has been severed

17:09.190 --> 17:11.280
between the middle
and distal phalanges. Thanks.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.280
Angle of shearing indicates
a single sharp-force trauma,

17:16.820 --> 17:18.620
possibly caused by shrapnel.

17:18.740 --> 17:22.200
No. No,
it's too even to be shrapnel trauma.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.460
Posterior charring
gives off a strong odour,

17:26.580 --> 17:29.550
suggesting perimortem immersion
in burning fuel.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.670
Diesel.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.760
-Accelerant, maybe?
-I don't know.

17:33.880 --> 17:37.430
If she was that close to the bomb, she
probably wouldn't be laying here now.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.930
What are you doing?

17:41.020 --> 17:42.730
What are you doing?

17:43.140 --> 17:44.310
You got a UV gun?

17:44.440 --> 17:46.190
Yeah, on the table behind you.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.070
-You see that?
-Duct tape.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.490
What's that stippling? You see that?

17:56.610 --> 17:59.490
Adhesive probably retained
some substance against the water.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.660
Yeah.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.250
Yeah, go ahead.

18:07.370 --> 18:09.340
I ran down those MPRs for you.

18:09.460 --> 18:12.590
A Claire Kuchever
was reported missing this morning.

18:12.710 --> 18:15.720
<i>Supposed to pick up her father</i>
<i>from the airport, pulled a no-show-</i>

18:15.840 --> 18:16.930
Okay.

18:18.550 --> 18:21.140
All right, Phil,
I want you to do a full autopsy.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.020
Concentrate on time and cause.

18:25.850 --> 18:27.690
Full spread of lab tests. Everything.

18:27.810 --> 18:31.020
Just pretend like the ferry explosion
never happened today, okay?

18:31.150 --> 18:32.480
Absolutely.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.280
Claire?

18:41.410 --> 18:44.040
-She's beautiful, huh?
-Yeah.

18:44.580 --> 18:45.660
Very.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.990
You'll need a photograph
for your investigation, right?

19:21.450 --> 19:24.410
There's plenty in the house.
Plenty to choose from.

19:27.410 --> 19:31.040
Mr Kuchever, I'm sorry about this,

19:34.300 --> 19:37.340
but I'm gonna need you
to confirm your daughter's identity.

19:43.260 --> 19:44.430
Okay.

19:45.260 --> 19:49.310
Now, anything that you can tell me

19:49.440 --> 19:52.440
about your daughter's activities
over the weekend,

19:52.560 --> 19:54.980
or any time, anything at all,
will be helpful.

19:55.610 --> 19:57.320
Well, I don't know.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.360
My flight got in
at 8:00 a.m. this morning,

19:59.490 --> 20:02.450
and she was supposed to pick me up,
but she wasn't there.

20:02.570 --> 20:04.450
I thought maybe she just overslept,

20:04.580 --> 20:07.620
so I took a cab
and I went straight to her house.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.290
Her and Alan's car was gone,

20:09.410 --> 20:12.290
so I thought
maybe she'd just finally sold it.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.340
-Who's Alan?
-Her fiancé.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.090
Or ex-fiancé.

20:16.460 --> 20:18.760
They broke up a few months ago.

20:19.090 --> 20:20.630
And where is he now, Alan?

20:20.760 --> 20:23.050
-He moved to Montreal.
-Okay.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.600
She was too good for him, anyway.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.270
I got a sweater that she left,
if you want to take it.

20:29.390 --> 20:33.940
No, that's okay. But if you have keys
to her house, I would appreciate it.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.650
Oh, she had a date.

20:38.110 --> 20:41.650
Last night on the phone, she told me
that she was gonna meet someone,

20:41.780 --> 20:45.030
but she didn't say who.
Her friend Beth set it up.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.240
Beth.

20:46.370 --> 20:50.160
Beth Walsh. Claire baby-sits
her daughter, Abbey, sometimes.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.370
Okay.

20:53.370 --> 20:54.670
Thank you.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.130
That's good for now.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.260
Somebody'll be in touch.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.720
Agent Carlin?

21:06.970 --> 21:08.010
Doug.

21:08.180 --> 21:10.180
I want you to take these.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.430
Well, that's...

21:12.560 --> 21:15.810
Just go through them
when you get a chance.

21:16.690 --> 21:19.400
-Well, it's really not necessary.
-Yes, it is.

21:19.860 --> 21:23.200
See, I know how these things go,
Agent Carlin,

21:23.400 --> 21:25.570
and I need her to matter to you.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.940
<i>Monday, 7:48 p-m-</i>

23:21.060 --> 23:22.770
<i>Hi, Claire- It's Dad-</i>

23:22.900 --> 23:25.190
<i>My flight gets in</i>
<i>at 7:55 tomorrow morning,</i>

23:25.320 --> 23:28.030
<i>so don't stay up too late-</i>
<i>Love you- Bye-bye-</i>

23:28.990 --> 23:31.910
<i>Tuesday, 9:44 a-m-</i>

23:32.030 --> 23:34.030
<i>Claire? Hi, it's Beth- Are you there?</i>

23:34.160 --> 23:35.200
<i>I'm sorry to call you so early,</i>

23:35.330 --> 23:37.080
<i>but you said you were gonna call me</i>
<i>when you got home,</i>

23:37.200 --> 23:38.580
<i>and when you didn't,</i>
<i>I started to get worried-</i>

23:38.710 --> 23:40.750
<i>-Beth, is this a joke?</i>
<i>-Oh, hey, hey! No-</i>

23:40.880 --> 23:42.750
<i>Like I said, I was just worried</i>
<i>about you, that's all-</i>

23:42.880 --> 23:45.000
<i>I can't talk right now-</i>
<i>Someone's here- I'll call you later-</i>

23:45.130 --> 23:46.460
<i>Claire---</i>

23:49.630 --> 23:51.970
<i>Tuesday, 9:50 a-m-</i>

23:57.060 --> 24:00.020
<i>Tuesday, 10:04 a-m-</i>

24:00.770 --> 24:04.770
<i>Claire, it's Dad- I did say 7:55, didn't I?</i>

24:04.900 --> 24:07.030
<i>I'm here at the airport, waiting for you-</i>

24:07.150 --> 24:10.240
<i>If you're not coming, I hope</i>
<i>you're sending Beth or someone-</i>

24:10.360 --> 24:11.910
<i>Call me-</i>

24:13.870 --> 24:16.490
<i>Tuesday, 1: 18 p-m-</i>

24:16.950 --> 24:20.210
<i>Yeah, this is A TF Agent Doug Carlin</i>
<i>returning your call-</i>

24:20.330 --> 24:23.420
<i>My cell number is 504-555-0130-</i>

24:34.140 --> 24:36.680
<i>Tuesday, 1: 18 p-m-</i>

24:37.640 --> 24:40.940
<i>Yeah, this is A TF Agent Doug Carlin</i>
<i>returning your call-</i>

24:41.060 --> 24:44.360
<i>My cell number is 504-555-0130-</i>

24:59.120 --> 25:02.210
The blast wave initiated here,
hit the bulkhead

25:02.500 --> 25:05.130
and propagated fore and aft
along the path of least resistance

25:05.250 --> 25:07.500
until it hits this access hatch.

25:07.630 --> 25:09.800
And that's where it gets really bad.

25:09.920 --> 25:10.920
<i>The blast wave continues</i>

25:11.050 --> 25:13.550
<i>into the engine room,</i>
<i>bursting the fuel tanks-</i>

25:13.680 --> 25:16.010
<i>This utility shaft here</i>
<i>acts like a chimney,</i>

25:16.140 --> 25:18.640
<i>draws the thermal components</i>
<i>into the engine room,</i>

25:18.760 --> 25:21.810
which ignites the fuel vapour,
causing a secondary explosion

25:21.930 --> 25:24.100
of far greater magnitude.

25:24.230 --> 25:27.570
Essentially, the initial device
turns the whole ferry into a bomb

25:27.690 --> 25:29.440
and detonates it.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.320
And so our early guess

25:31.440 --> 25:33.820
is that the bomb vehicle
was a minivan or SUV.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.820
-Possibly red or tan.
-Make and model?

25:36.950 --> 25:41.200
-Take weeks, maybe months.
-I got a partial on the licence plate.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.330
Shit.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.330
Check all the SUVs and minivans
that are registered in the state.

25:47.460 --> 25:48.960
Anything recently rented or purchased,

25:49.090 --> 25:51.550
anything tied to a theft
or a missing persons report.

25:51.670 --> 25:52.920
-Agent McCready?
-Yeah.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.680
Doug Carlin, ATF.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.510
Oh, yeah. Oklahoma City.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.560
Right. That's right.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.680
This afternoon, I witnessed an autopsy

26:01.810 --> 26:04.520
of a young woman who washed up
off the Poland Wharf.

26:05.730 --> 26:09.060
Heavy fuel burns,
traces of PETN on her face.

26:09.190 --> 26:12.360
PETN, that's the base explosive
used by domestic terrorists.

26:12.900 --> 26:17.030
She also lost several fingers
in what appeared to be blast damage.

26:17.530 --> 26:18.530
Appeared?

26:18.660 --> 26:21.540
That's right. I checked the tide tables
against the position of the blast.

26:21.660 --> 26:24.210
For her to have washed up
that early and that far upriver,

26:24.330 --> 26:27.790
she would've had to have been killed
two hours before the ferry exploded.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.130
Before?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.920
She died before the explosion?

26:33.050 --> 26:36.760
She died before the explosion, yeah.
Her name is Claire Kuchever.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.050
She washed up before the explosion
and against the tide.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.220
-Do you have a scenario?
-Yes, I do.

26:43.350 --> 26:47.060
I believe that somebody abducted her
in her home, taped her mouth,

26:47.190 --> 26:49.980
bound her wrists, burnt her alive,
dumped her in the river

26:50.110 --> 26:53.110
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.690
A disaster that hadn't happened yet.

26:55.820 --> 26:58.360
But the PETN tells us

26:58.490 --> 27:01.120
that the bomber came in direct contact
with the victim.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.240
You solve her case,
you solve this case.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.580
Why this woman?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.330
Good question. Her SUV is missing.

27:09.630 --> 27:12.210
It's a tan and red Bronco.

27:12.340 --> 27:15.920
It could have been stolen
to drive the bomb to the ferry.

27:16.380 --> 27:17.510
Oh, one more thing.

27:17.630 --> 27:20.510
The victim called the local ATF office

27:20.640 --> 27:22.930
the morning of the explosion.

27:23.810 --> 27:24.890
Yeah.

27:25.980 --> 27:27.940
-We'll look into it.
-Okay.

27:29.150 --> 27:30.770
All right.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.400
Okay.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.780
Where's Larry?

27:44.200 --> 27:46.160
-What?
-Larry Minuti, my partner.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.710
That's his car right there. Is he here?

27:49.620 --> 27:52.080
I thought you said he was on vacation.

27:52.210 --> 27:54.040
Yeah, that's right.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.880
What?

28:01.300 --> 28:04.680
Those cars were brought here
from the Algiers ferry parking lot.

28:05.430 --> 28:08.640
They're the vehicles
that belonged to the victims.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.830
Sorry.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.180
So he's a former Marine?

28:41.300 --> 28:44.890
Yes, sir. Yeah. Local, too.
He's born and bred in New Orleans.

28:45.810 --> 28:47.010
His family still in the area?

28:47.140 --> 28:49.770
Nope. Nothing, really, but his job.

28:50.350 --> 28:52.520
-You like him?
-He's smart.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.690
Yeah, I like him, too.

28:54.810 --> 28:56.400
All right. Let's go find him.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.090
Oklahoma City.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.720
Yeah.

29:32.770 --> 29:35.060
-You and Larry were close?
-Yeah.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.900
Yeah, you know, close enough
to get on each other's nerves.

29:40.610 --> 29:44.740
Doug, I've been put in charge
of a newly-formed investigative unit.

29:44.990 --> 29:48.740
The ferry disaster is our first case,
and I want you on the team.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.040
Why me?

29:50.540 --> 29:53.290
We've got
some unique time constraints.

29:53.410 --> 29:57.460
I need someone who can look
at a crime scene exactly one time,

29:57.880 --> 30:00.880
tell us what's missing,
tell us what shouldn't be there,

30:01.130 --> 30:02.420
tell us what we can ignore

30:02.550 --> 30:04.930
and, especially,
what we need to pursue.

30:05.050 --> 30:08.430
Also, you're local. You know the people
and you know the area.

30:08.550 --> 30:10.390
But why an ATF guy?

30:10.510 --> 30:12.980
Why not? It's your shot.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.810
You want to find the guy
who killed Minuti, don't you?

30:18.650 --> 30:19.690
Yes, I do.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.300
I guess you've got some questions.

30:45.420 --> 30:49.140
For me to have questions,
first I'd need to know something.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.040
Now I do have some questions.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.710
Don't touch anything.
We don't need you yet.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.670
Doug, you remember
Dr Alexander Denny.

31:25.590 --> 31:26.920
Where's my audio?

31:27.050 --> 31:29.760
Compensating for audio delay.
Just a second.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.600
Compensating for a technical blunder
by a tech guy...

31:33.720 --> 31:37.480
Solid stream. Minus four days,
six hours, three minutes, 45 seconds.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.940
And 14 and a half nanoseconds.

31:40.730 --> 31:41.770
Okay.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.690
Anytime you want to jump in here,
be my guest.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.240
-Me?
-Yeah.

31:56.910 --> 31:58.210
What are we looking for?

31:58.330 --> 32:01.540
You know, clues, suspects,
anything out of the norm.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.550
-When was this taken?
-Four and a half days ago.

32:04.670 --> 32:06.960
Gunnars,
try the guy with the backpack.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.720
Oh, that's tender.

32:16.060 --> 32:18.310
I wish I had someone. Okay, widen out.

32:18.430 --> 32:21.560
Let's cruise the car deck for a while,
see what we got.

32:26.530 --> 32:27.690
How can you change the angle

32:27.820 --> 32:30.070
on footage
taken four and a half days ago?

32:30.200 --> 32:31.490
This is a digital recreation.

32:31.610 --> 32:34.700
We're combining all the data we've got
into one fluid shot.

32:34.830 --> 32:37.240
Any angle, any view
within the target area.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.290
Okay, let's cruise the breezeway,

32:41.420 --> 32:43.540
see what we get there.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.250
It's a brand-new programme.
It's called Snow White.

32:46.380 --> 32:48.590
Our primary data comes from
seven orbiting satellites,

32:48.710 --> 32:52.260
but at any given time, as many as four
are surveilling one area.

32:52.430 --> 32:56.760
It's like having multiple eyewitnesses,
each with their own vantage point.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.600
Snow White?

33:03.310 --> 33:04.980
Well, which one of the seven dwarfs

33:05.110 --> 33:07.820
can explain to me
how you get the audio?

33:12.950 --> 33:14.660
I don't understand.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.540
Why do you gotta
look at four days ago?

33:17.660 --> 33:20.500
Why don't you just fast-forward it
to the day of the explosion?

33:20.620 --> 33:22.370
We have to wait.
It takes four and a half days

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
to render this single fluid shot.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.250
The only thing that matters

33:26.380 --> 33:29.630
is that we have exactly one look
at any one time.

33:30.630 --> 33:33.340
Yeah. We can't go back 10 minutes,
you know?

33:33.470 --> 33:36.470
Can't look back and see
if there was a second gunman.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.930
We can't watch the agent
buying 10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.980
All right? But given enough lead time,

33:44.100 --> 33:46.310
we can look anywhere
within the target area, all right?

33:46.440 --> 33:50.320
It's the when that's always constant.
It's always four days and six hours ago.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.900
Always. You understand?

33:52.030 --> 33:56.320
It's like a single trailing moment of now,
in the past.

33:57.580 --> 34:02.540
Okay. So if you can't move forward
or backward in time,

34:02.660 --> 34:04.620
how is it
the image keeps speeding up like that?

34:04.750 --> 34:07.960
It's not the image that's moving faster,
it's just our shifting point of view.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.840
The passage of time remains constant,
but we can shift our point of view

34:10.960 --> 34:13.170
within the data stream
as fast as we want.

34:13.550 --> 34:17.010
-You understand?
-Yeah. Yeah. No.

34:17.220 --> 34:18.350
Yeah, I know.

34:18.470 --> 34:20.640
So four days from...
Well, actually, three days from now,

34:20.760 --> 34:24.020
since it's after midnight,
you'll be able to look back

34:24.190 --> 34:25.850
to the day of the explosion,
see who did it,

34:25.980 --> 34:27.980
how they did it
and what they did it with.

34:28.110 --> 34:29.190
Yeah, you got it.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.360
The only thing is,
you need to tell us where to look,

34:31.480 --> 34:34.700
'cause, you know, we could miss it.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.490
Besides, three days could be too late.
He could leave the country,

34:38.620 --> 34:40.030
could strike again.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.450
We need to do whatever we can now.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.960
We know he's out there planning this.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.170
We just don't know where to look.

34:48.580 --> 34:51.050
So, Agent Carlin, where do we look?

34:55.590 --> 34:57.470
Claire Kuchever's house.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.810
Address is in range.

35:01.970 --> 35:04.430
All right, match the viewer settings
to the signal.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.150
-Signal's solid.
-All right, dazzle me.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.370
What?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.920
You see, with Snow White
we can track through walls.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.750
It's part of the same infrared
thermal-imaging stuff

35:32.880 --> 35:33.920
they're using in Iraq.

35:34.050 --> 35:37.840
<i>-Hello- This is 877-504-8423-</i>
-We triangulate from four satellites,

35:37.970 --> 35:39.930
pick up the heat signal and reconstruct.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.220
Basically, we can walk through walls.

35:44.390 --> 35:46.060
Claire Kuchever.

35:46.180 --> 35:48.440
<i>-Claire? Hello?</i>
-Did you know her?

35:48.980 --> 35:51.610
We held hands once,
but no, I didn't know her.

35:51.730 --> 35:53.940
<i>Just checking in,</i>
<i>wondering how you're doing-</i>

35:54.730 --> 35:57.780
<i>Montreal's fantastic,</i>
<i>but my boss is an ass-</i>

35:57.900 --> 36:00.070
Can you rotate the view,
see what she's looking at?

36:00.200 --> 36:01.370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:01.490 --> 36:02.830
<i>I want you to come visit, though-</i>

36:02.950 --> 36:05.120
<i>The city's phenomenal-</i>
<i>You're gonna love it-</i>

36:05.240 --> 36:07.200
<i>Claire? Claire?</i>

36:07.330 --> 36:09.290
555-0118.

36:09.420 --> 36:10.790
-Somebody got that?
-Yeah.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.460
<i>Claire, you there?</i>

36:13.420 --> 36:16.510
<i>Listen, I've had a lot of time to think,</i>

36:23.850 --> 36:26.560
<i>and I need you to sell the Bronco</i>
<i>as soon as possible-</i>

36:31.730 --> 36:35.320
<i>Or at least pay me back my half-</i>
<i>I just really need the money-</i>

36:35.820 --> 36:37.820
<i>I love you, honey- Call me-</i>

36:38.360 --> 36:39.650
<i>Unbelievable-</i>

36:41.820 --> 36:44.530
-Where's she... Can you follow her?
-No problem.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.720
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

37:05.850 --> 37:06.850
What?

37:07.390 --> 37:11.230
It's Stalhuth, at that house you found.
Female murder victim, Claire?

37:14.020 --> 37:15.650
Right. What do you got?

37:15.770 --> 37:19.740
We got some bloody cotton swabs
and gauze strips in the bathroom,

37:19.860 --> 37:22.700
<i>some blood in the sink trap-</i>
<i>And, oh, hey, Carlin?</i>

37:22.820 --> 37:26.120
Man, when did you completely forget
how to investigate a crime scene?

37:26.240 --> 37:27.410
What do you mean?

37:27.540 --> 37:29.040
This place is lousy
with your fingerprints.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.040
They're all over the place.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.760
Do me a favour. Just describe what
you see for me, okay? Just humour me.

37:42.470 --> 37:45.010
Woman's bedroom. Vanity mirror.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.850
Dressing table with makeup,
knick-knacks.

37:48.970 --> 37:50.100
Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

37:50.220 --> 37:52.940
Is there anybody there?
Anybody brushing their teeth?

37:53.190 --> 37:57.730
No. Just a couple agents,
including Hendricks, who's bent over,

37:57.860 --> 38:00.610
and I have a fine view
of the crack of his ass.

38:00.730 --> 38:03.610
Okay, I get the picture.
Talk to you later.

38:04.030 --> 38:05.490
You satisfied?

38:05.990 --> 38:08.280
She was supposed to go on a date
the night before she died.

38:08.410 --> 38:11.200
I want to get her appointment books
and everything brought down here,

38:11.330 --> 38:14.830
you know, her phone records,
credit cards, diaries, anything.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.960
I wanna know everything
there is to know about this woman.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.170
Well, shouldn't we
be concentrating on the ferry?

38:19.300 --> 38:21.630
Well, yeah, it's likely that our guy

38:21.760 --> 38:25.800
cased the ferry first,
but we don't know when.

38:26.510 --> 38:27.970
We don't even know what he looks like.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.140
I mean, we could stare him
right in the face and not know it's him.

38:31.270 --> 38:34.230
But we will notice a change,
even a small change, in her life.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.230
<i>-Hey, Beth-</i>
<i>-Claire-</i>

38:41.360 --> 38:43.990
<i>That guy I've been telling you about</i>
<i>really wants to meet you-</i>

38:44.110 --> 38:46.320
<i>Okay- Tell him</i>
<i>I'll meet him Monday night-</i>

38:46.450 --> 38:47.450
Monday.

38:47.570 --> 38:48.990
<i>How about Sunday</i>
<i>if you're not doing anything?</i>

38:49.120 --> 38:50.740
<i>-No, Monday-</i>
<i>-Great- I'll give him your number-</i>

38:50.870 --> 38:52.870
<i>No, do not give him my number-</i>
<i>I'll go meet him-</i>

38:53.000 --> 38:54.620
<i>-He's not some psycho killer-</i>
-Who? Him who?

38:54.750 --> 38:58.000
<i>I don't even know if I can do it Monday-</i>
<i>Hang on-</i>

38:58.130 --> 38:59.670
Show me the book.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.920
<i>Monday works-</i>

39:03.050 --> 39:04.050
-Damn!
-Shit!

39:04.170 --> 39:05.220
Can we go back?

39:05.340 --> 39:06.380
-No.
-Seriously?

39:06.510 --> 39:09.010
No, it's far too much data
for any existing storage system.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.970
It's a constant stream.
There's no rewind, no second chances.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.930
We can record what we're seeing,
but we can't go back

39:14.060 --> 39:15.230
and choose to look
at something different.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.520
Okay. You said we can record, though?

39:17.650 --> 39:18.810
-Yes.
-Okay.

39:22.900 --> 39:26.950
Tell me, is there any scientific
or forensic insight likely to be gained

39:27.530 --> 39:30.120
by spying on this woman
in the shower?

39:30.240 --> 39:33.540
Shanti, we're trying to make sure
the woman's clean.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.410
All right, why don't you,

39:37.580 --> 39:40.710
you know, look around the rest of
the bathroom? Can you do that?

39:49.430 --> 39:51.600
-Gunnars.
-Yeah.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.760
-You back?
-Sorry.

39:52.890 --> 39:53.970
All right.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.440
Icy Hot, Band-Aids, baby oil.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.900
This woman needs a vice.

40:01.020 --> 40:02.570
What's on the other side of that wall?

40:02.690 --> 40:03.900
Kitchen.

40:04.070 --> 40:05.900
Let's take a look.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.610
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

40:18.210 --> 40:21.170
Maybe there's someone out there.
Maybe there's a stalker.

40:21.290 --> 40:22.750
<i>Someone there?</i>

40:24.500 --> 40:26.010
<i>Hey, Ginger-</i>

40:30.430 --> 40:31.550
<i>Hello?</i>

40:33.640 --> 40:35.850
Does she know I'm here?
Does she know we're here?

40:35.970 --> 40:38.350
No, impossible. Strictly one-way.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.440
You sure?

40:52.660 --> 40:53.780
<i>Hello?</i>

40:53.910 --> 40:56.790
Okay, let's check the perimeter.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.670
Nobody.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.800
Who's watching her?

41:09.970 --> 41:11.130
We are.

41:43.580 --> 41:46.920
<i>They will also take up a request</i>
<i>for more money for the---</i>

41:51.380 --> 41:54.720
<i>God, thank you for blessing me</i>
<i>with this food and with my life-</i>

41:56.510 --> 41:59.970
<i>I know today's gonna be a great day-</i>
<i>Amen-</i>

42:04.770 --> 42:07.860
<i>You guys singing?</i>
<i>You singing a love song?</i>

42:09.070 --> 42:11.690
<i>You singing a love song</i>
<i>to one another?</i>

42:12.740 --> 42:14.200
<i>What you doing?</i>

42:37.140 --> 42:38.140
<i>Hi-</i>

42:46.270 --> 42:48.860
<i>Yeah, it's been a while-</i>

42:58.280 --> 43:01.410
Everything God has done
will remain forever.

43:01.950 --> 43:03.830
There is nothing to add to it,

43:03.950 --> 43:05.830
nothing to take from it.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.960
God has done this
so that men should be in awe...

43:09.080 --> 43:10.590
Ex didn't show.

43:10.710 --> 43:13.880
-Would you?
-Whatever is has already been,

43:14.010 --> 43:16.260
and what will be has been before.

43:17.090 --> 43:20.100
God calls forth the past.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.400
Claire loved music.

43:29.150 --> 43:30.860
There's a church near our house,

43:31.730 --> 43:34.110
and gospel fills the neighbourhood.

43:35.110 --> 43:39.700
When she was little,
Claire saw a jazz funeral procession.

43:40.620 --> 43:42.330
She asked me that day,

43:42.490 --> 43:44.950
"Why do they always wait until the end

43:45.370 --> 43:47.080
"to play the good music?"

43:47.540 --> 43:50.330
Claire, honey, the music's playing
for you now and forever.

44:13.150 --> 44:15.190
Were there four limo drivers or five?

44:15.320 --> 44:18.400
Four limos.
Must have been four drivers, right?

44:21.120 --> 44:22.490
He was here.

44:27.620 --> 44:29.580
Address is in range.

44:31.250 --> 44:32.630
Palace Restaurant.

44:32.750 --> 44:34.800
They got good food there.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.760
<i>I'm so sorry for the wait- I really am-</i>

44:40.890 --> 44:41.930
<i>Listen---</i>

44:42.050 --> 44:43.800
<i>Your table will be ready</i>
<i>in a few minutes-</i>

44:43.930 --> 44:45.350
<i>Drinks are on me, all right?</i>

44:45.470 --> 44:47.430
<i>It is gonna be a few more minutes</i>
<i>for your table---</i>

44:47.560 --> 44:49.350
<i>Go upstairs and see if Table 45</i>
<i>is ready for desserts-</i>

44:49.480 --> 44:50.480
<i>-All right?</i>
<i>-I will-</i>

44:50.600 --> 44:53.310
<i>Hold on- Hang on- Hello? Hello?</i>

44:53.440 --> 44:55.520
<i>Hey, are you the lady</i>
<i>with the Bronco for sale?</i>

44:55.650 --> 44:57.030
-That's him.
-How do you know?

44:57.150 --> 44:59.030
-That's him.
-Well, call up the phone list.

44:59.150 --> 45:01.200
Let's see if it's a number we've tracked.

45:02.740 --> 45:04.740
<i>Yes, that's me- Just a second-</i>

45:04.950 --> 45:06.040
<i>Cover for me, all right?</i>

45:06.160 --> 45:07.580
Keep that tape running, too.

45:07.700 --> 45:10.410
I'm gonna want a recording
of this conversation for voice analysis.

45:10.540 --> 45:12.500
<i>-I'm here- Can you hear me?</i>
<i>-Well, hello, there-</i>

45:12.630 --> 45:14.040
<i>Let me tell you, first off,</i>

45:14.170 --> 45:16.250
<i>I'm what you could call</i>
<i>a real motivated buyer-</i>

45:16.380 --> 45:17.380
I bet you are.

45:17.510 --> 45:18.920
<i>I'm ready to get something right away-</i>

45:19.050 --> 45:21.550
<i>That sounds great-</i>
<i>I need to sell something right away-</i>

45:21.680 --> 45:24.890
<i>Your price looks good,</i>
<i>model, mileage---</i>

45:25.300 --> 45:27.140
<i>So where can I come by and see it?</i>

45:27.260 --> 45:28.720
Don't tell him.

45:28.850 --> 45:31.560
<i>I'm at 827 Kings Oak,</i>
<i>in the French Quarter-</i>

45:31.640 --> 45:33.440
<i>-Need directions?</i>
-Now he knows where she lives.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.400
<i>No, no, I'll find you-</i>
<i>Is tomorrow night good?</i>

45:36.520 --> 45:39.320
<i>Actually, l---</i>
<i>Tomorrow night is not good-</i>

45:39.440 --> 45:40.780
-Tomorrow?
<i>-I'm going out tomorrow-</i>

45:40.900 --> 45:43.280
He wants to wait for the last
possible moment to steal her car,

45:43.410 --> 45:45.160
then it's too late to report it.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.450
<i>How does Tuesday sound?</i>

45:46.580 --> 45:49.750
Got it. 504-555-0147.

45:49.910 --> 45:51.210
I see it. Tracking.

45:51.330 --> 45:53.170
<i>I think that's gonna be too late-</i>

45:53.290 --> 45:55.080
<i>See, I need the vehicle</i>
<i>Tuesday morning-</i>

45:55.210 --> 45:57.840
<i>Is there anyone else there</i>
<i>that can show me the car?</i>

45:57.960 --> 45:59.630
<i>-No- Sorry-</i>
-He's thinking.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.260
<i>I'll tell you what- There's a K5 Blazer---</i>

46:01.380 --> 46:03.130
A date means
somebody's gonna be expecting her

46:03.260 --> 46:04.800
and will miss her
if she doesn't show up.

46:04.930 --> 46:07.100
That could ruin his plans.
Shanti, I want to see this guy.

46:07.220 --> 46:10.470
No good. It's an outdoor phone booth.
Three miles out of range.

46:11.350 --> 46:12.810
<i>I hope to hear from you-</i>

46:12.940 --> 46:15.980
Can we get someone out there
with a goggle rig?

46:18.570 --> 46:20.480
What's that do? Extend the range?

46:20.610 --> 46:22.440
Yeah, it's immediate line of sight.

46:22.570 --> 46:25.160
But we can use it to gather data
outside the target area.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.620
Provided there's any data to gather.

46:26.740 --> 46:28.370
How long is this guy
gonna be at the phone booth?

46:28.490 --> 46:29.790
Not long.

46:29.910 --> 46:31.450
<i>-Have a good night-</i>
<i>-Thanks-</i>

46:31.580 --> 46:32.620
<i>Bye-</i>

46:33.830 --> 46:35.290
<i>Story of my life-</i>

46:35.420 --> 46:36.960
Yeah, story of my life, too.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.960
All right, now we heard
the voice of our bomber,

46:39.090 --> 46:40.840
now we're gonna go after him
the old-fashioned way.

46:40.960 --> 46:43.130
Can we get video surveillance
on that phone booth?

46:43.260 --> 46:46.470
We can access all surveillance
available to any government agency.

46:54.270 --> 46:56.810
Okay, this is from the ATM camera
across the street.

46:58.940 --> 47:03.490
All right. Let's fast-forward to the exact
time of his phone call to Claire.

47:07.030 --> 47:08.490
Where are we supposed to be looking?

47:08.620 --> 47:10.330
Behind the guy on the left.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.450
Can you enhance it, Gunnars?

47:14.790 --> 47:16.670
Not enough for an ID.

47:19.380 --> 47:22.000
Wait, go back.
Can you rewind it just a little bit?

47:22.130 --> 47:24.630
Stop. What is that on the ground?

47:26.680 --> 47:28.800
Looks like a camcorder bag, maybe.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.640
-We have facial recognition software?
-Yeah.

47:31.720 --> 47:32.890
Let's use it on the bag.

47:33.020 --> 47:35.390
Cross-match it to all the bags
on the south side of the city

47:35.520 --> 47:38.350
in the 48 hours leading up
to the explosion, all right?

47:41.520 --> 47:43.150
Don't think it's ever been
used this way.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.440
Yeah, that's kind of a simple image
to go for a match.

47:45.570 --> 47:47.400
Well, we got nowhere else to go.

47:51.620 --> 47:54.660
-Look, same bag.
-Bingo.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.250
Okay, freeze it.

48:04.550 --> 48:07.090
Yeah, looks like the same guy, too.
Where is this?

48:07.220 --> 48:09.590
Security camera
at the Algiers ferry dock.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.100
Okay, when is this?

48:11.220 --> 48:14.640
Two nights before the explosion.
Seven hours from now.

48:15.310 --> 48:17.520
Two nights before the explosion
is seven hours from now?

48:17.640 --> 48:21.810
Seven hours from now, we will be able
to access this point in our time window.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.110
Gotcha.

48:31.910 --> 48:36.120
Kind of creepy, seeing that lady's life
go down in flames.

48:36.620 --> 48:37.620
Yep.

48:38.410 --> 48:40.420
Makes you appreciate life.

48:41.420 --> 48:44.040
I suggest you go home
and jump on whoever you got.

48:44.170 --> 48:46.760
-That's what I'm gonna do.
-Nobody home.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.970
How'd you let that happen?

48:50.970 --> 48:54.640
Everything you have, you lose, right?
Mother, father, gone.

48:55.180 --> 48:57.350
Good looks, Pryzwarra, gone.

48:58.140 --> 48:59.850
Loved ones gone in a second.

48:59.980 --> 49:02.310
That's what this job teaches you,
doesn't it?

49:02.440 --> 49:03.980
No matter what,

49:04.400 --> 49:08.190
no matter how hard you grab
onto something, you still lose it, right?

49:08.320 --> 49:11.990
Well, we're gonna grab onto this guy
in a couple hours.

49:12.530 --> 49:14.990
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.450
What's wrong?

49:21.330 --> 49:23.710
No matter what, we still lose her.

49:26.170 --> 49:27.300
Right?

50:10.510 --> 50:12.590
<i>-Okay-</i>
<i>-All right-</i>

50:26.520 --> 50:28.520
-What's going on?
-Give it a second.

50:28.650 --> 50:30.230
-Gunnars.
-It's rebooting. It's coming back.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.240
-Are we online?
-Wait.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.360
-Are we online?
-Gunnars!

50:33.490 --> 50:35.450
-What the hell's going on?
-Shanti, are we back online?

50:35.570 --> 50:36.870
I don't know.
Something broached the field.

50:36.990 --> 50:39.410
-What broached the field?
-That broached the field, right there.

50:39.540 --> 50:42.250
That broached the field, right there.
That's what broached the field.

50:42.330 --> 50:44.290
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is?

50:44.420 --> 50:47.790
It's not surveillance, Paul.
It's not electronic thermal imaging.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.630
You guys have figured out a way
to look into the past. Yes or no?

50:50.710 --> 50:51.710
-No.
-You're lying.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.220
-You're lying, and you know it.
-I've told you everything I can.

50:54.340 --> 50:57.050
She saw it, Paul.
I pointed this thing at her just now,

50:57.180 --> 50:59.890
and she responded to it
from four and a half days ago.

50:59.970 --> 51:02.220
-Explain that to me.
-All right.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.520
Somebody explain it!

51:06.190 --> 51:07.690
Hit it, Shanti.

51:09.820 --> 51:11.150
For three years,
Cambridge has been working

51:11.280 --> 51:13.280
for National Reconnaissance
on an R & D grant.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.450
Okay.

51:14.570 --> 51:16.950
We were attempting
to use concentrated bursts of energy

51:17.070 --> 51:19.450
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes.

51:19.580 --> 51:20.950
In the process, we had a breakthrough.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.500
Given enough energy,
we could warp the very fabric of space.

51:23.620 --> 51:26.170
I said explain it to me, not talk science.

51:26.290 --> 51:27.920
-They found a way to...
-Look, I'll tell you what.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.670
Why don't you guys just keep talking?
I'll just sit here

51:30.800 --> 51:32.920
until you figure out
what it is you really wanna tell me.

51:33.050 --> 51:36.090
They found a way
to fold space back onto itself.

51:38.010 --> 51:42.140
All right, look. We're used to viewing
space as flat, right?

51:42.260 --> 51:43.310
-Like this piece of paper.
-Right.

51:43.430 --> 51:45.680
To see something from a distance,
light has always had to travel

51:45.810 --> 51:47.350
the long way
across the flat space in between.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.850
But given what I was trying to explain,

51:48.980 --> 51:51.730
we can fold the space,
bring the target closer to us,

51:51.860 --> 51:53.650
create what's known as
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

51:53.780 --> 51:56.820
otherwise known as a wormhole,
suspend it via gravitational field.

51:56.950 --> 51:58.160
-That's what we're looking at?
-That's it.

51:58.280 --> 52:00.160
What's on the other end of the bridge?

52:00.280 --> 52:01.830
Claire's house.

52:03.790 --> 52:04.830
Wow.

52:04.950 --> 52:07.000
Basically, we're folding space
in a higher dimension

52:07.120 --> 52:09.750
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.840
-Instantaneous?
-Well, that's what we hoped for

52:11.960 --> 52:14.170
and that's what we expected.
But the electrical force...

52:14.300 --> 52:16.800
We used huge amounts of energy
to create this bridge.

52:16.920 --> 52:18.010
All right, how huge?

52:18.130 --> 52:20.220
You remember that little blackout
we had a few years back?

52:20.340 --> 52:21.390
-Yes, I do.
-New York blamed Canada.

52:21.510 --> 52:22.680
-Right.
-Canada blamed Michigan.

52:22.810 --> 52:24.680
Half the Northeast.
You're saying you guys...

52:24.810 --> 52:26.810
-Fifty million homes. Right.
-My bad.

52:26.930 --> 52:28.560
Well, I still say we blame Canada, but...

52:28.690 --> 52:31.020
Okay, so why can't I see this bridge?

52:31.150 --> 52:33.520
It's not visible to the human eye.
I mean, it's real, though.

52:33.650 --> 52:34.860
It's just as real and just as solid

52:34.980 --> 52:36.360
as a cell phone signal or a radio wave.

52:36.490 --> 52:38.740
Right. Well, I don't know
how a cell phone works.

52:38.860 --> 52:42.450
I just know how to use it.
So how do we use this?

52:42.740 --> 52:44.120
We can look back four and a half days.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.040
-And what, we can look anywhere?
-Limited radius.

52:47.160 --> 52:49.210
Right, right, right.
Looking into the past.

52:49.330 --> 52:51.330
In a sense,
we're always looking in the past.

52:51.460 --> 52:54.040
Even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror

52:54.170 --> 52:55.500
takes some time to reflect back.

52:55.630 --> 52:56.710
Let me get this straight.

52:56.840 --> 53:00.630
You're trying to tell me
that on the other side of this bridge

53:01.090 --> 53:02.800
-is the actual past?
-Yes.

53:02.930 --> 53:04.310
-Wow.
-Yeah. But look, look, look.

53:04.430 --> 53:06.560
We created this thing by pure accident.
All right?

53:06.680 --> 53:11.190
This space and time...
This time window is a complete fluke.

53:11.520 --> 53:15.270
All right? And everybody is terrified
of screwing with it for fear of losing it

53:15.400 --> 53:17.530
or suffering the consequences
of God knows what,

53:17.650 --> 53:19.610
which is why it can only be used
as a retroactive tool...

53:19.740 --> 53:21.860
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is she alive or is she dead?

53:21.990 --> 53:23.530
-You went to her funeral, Doug.
-I know that,

53:23.660 --> 53:26.620
but I think the question still applies.
Is she alive or is she dead?

53:26.740 --> 53:30.410
All right. Life, like time and space,
is not merely a local phenomenon.

53:30.540 --> 53:31.920
All right!

53:33.210 --> 53:35.090
Am I asking a hard question?

53:35.210 --> 53:37.630
Looks like I picked a bad week
to stop snorting hash.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.920
All right, I tell you what.

53:39.050 --> 53:43.590
I'll speak slow, so those of you with
Ph.D.'s in the room can understand.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.930
It... Here. Look. Here's a monitor, right?

53:48.930 --> 53:51.940
Now the monitor is broken. It's dead.

53:52.060 --> 53:55.860
It is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy.

53:55.980 --> 54:01.110
It's dead, right?
Now, is she alive or is she dead?

54:01.320 --> 54:02.610
-She's alive.
-All right.

54:02.740 --> 54:03.780
Now we're getting somewhere.

54:03.910 --> 54:05.830
All right, now, you said
light could go back. What else?

54:05.950 --> 54:07.490
-Nothing.
-Something else could be sent back.

54:07.620 --> 54:09.620
Come on, Paul. Something.
What? A body? A human being?

54:09.750 --> 54:11.790
-No.
-Not a person. Not alive, anyway.

54:11.910 --> 54:13.960
-Why not?
-Because you can't beat the physics.

54:14.080 --> 54:16.540
The electromagnetic field.
Look, you transition across

54:16.670 --> 54:18.460
what's known as
the Wheeler Boundary, all right?

54:18.590 --> 54:20.800
An EM pulse annihilates
all electrical activity.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.800
That's your heartbeat,
that's brainwaves, that's everything.

54:22.930 --> 54:24.800
So what? You haven't tried a person?

54:24.930 --> 54:26.140
Let's just say
that we've done enough tests

54:26.260 --> 54:28.180
to know that it's not even possible.

54:28.310 --> 54:30.850
It's not even theoretically possible.
The hamster goes back, dead.

54:30.980 --> 54:33.140
-A drosophila fly, dead.
-What about a radio signal?

54:33.270 --> 54:34.480
What about that?
We could send a radio...

54:34.600 --> 54:35.770
-A radio signal?
-Yeah, a radio signal.

54:35.900 --> 54:37.690
-Won't work. Electrical.
-The field would scramble it.

54:37.820 --> 54:40.150
-All right, then a note, a warning note.
-No.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.990
-A single piece of paper. One sheet.
-No.

54:42.110 --> 54:43.490
-lf we keep the mass low...
-No!

54:43.610 --> 54:44.700
This could work! It could work.

54:44.820 --> 54:46.030
Sure. We know
where the guy's gonna be.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.660
We can apprehend him
and put him away

54:47.780 --> 54:48.780
before he even blows up the boat.

54:48.910 --> 54:51.160
-And how do we do that, exactly?
-We send it to ourselves!

54:51.290 --> 54:53.830
You send it to me. Yeah, send it to me.
Send it to my office.

54:53.960 --> 54:55.830
Send it to my office
four and a half days ago,

54:55.960 --> 54:59.090
an anonymous tip, and we can capture
this guy before he even meets Claire.

54:59.210 --> 55:01.010
We know he's gonna be at the dock.

55:01.130 --> 55:02.210
Whatever you did, you did it already.

55:02.340 --> 55:05.130
Whether you send this note or you
don't send this note, it doesn't matter.

55:05.260 --> 55:08.180
You cannot change the past.
It's physically impossible.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.720
What if there's more than physics?

55:12.770 --> 55:15.020
Okay. Something spiritual, right?

55:15.140 --> 55:17.900
-Yeah, something spiritual.
-Okay, okay, okay. Look.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.440
Just try to think of it this way.

55:19.570 --> 55:21.570
God's mind is made up about this.
All right?

55:21.690 --> 55:24.320
I mean, you know,
call it fate, call it destiny, whatever.

55:24.450 --> 55:26.740
But it already happened,
it will keep happening,

55:26.860 --> 55:29.240
-and it always will happen.
-Maybe.

55:29.370 --> 55:31.620
And why don't we call it fate,
since we're calling it something?

55:31.740 --> 55:34.330
Maybe you're right. Maybe you guys
are exactly right. I don't know.

55:34.460 --> 55:36.670
All I know is this. For all of my career,

55:36.790 --> 55:39.880
I've been trying to catch people
after they do something horrible.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
For once in my life,

55:41.130 --> 55:43.670
I'd like to catch somebody
before they do something horrible.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.630
All right? Can you understand that?

55:50.890 --> 55:52.060
Address is in range.

55:52.010 --> 55:52.560
Address is in range.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.650
Two L's. "Surveilling," two L's.

56:01.110 --> 56:03.690
Since this is such a tremendous waste
of taxpayer money,

56:03.820 --> 56:05.280
the least we could do
is get the spelling right.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.450
That's not necessarily true.

56:06.570 --> 56:08.240
Branching universe theory holds
that you can do...

56:08.360 --> 56:10.570
-Oh, branching universe theory.
-Look, hold it. All right.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.620
-No, no, no.
-I'll show you.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.910
The traditional view of time is linear,

56:15.040 --> 56:17.960
like a river flowing from the past
toward the future.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.080
But you can change
the course of a river, right?

56:20.210 --> 56:24.000
Exactly. Introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river

56:24.130 --> 56:25.840
and you create a new branch,

56:25.970 --> 56:29.390
still flowing toward the future,
but along a different route.

56:29.510 --> 56:30.590
Changed.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.810
Yeah, but that river is the Mississippi,

56:32.930 --> 56:34.930
and we're lobbing
what amounts to a pebble into it.

56:35.060 --> 56:38.390
That's a very few tiny ripples in a kind
of big body of water, don't you think?

56:38.520 --> 56:39.940
Traditionalist.

56:40.060 --> 56:41.650
Say we do create this new branch.

56:41.770 --> 56:43.940
What happens to the old one?
To this one?

56:44.070 --> 56:45.610
Ask the radical.

56:46.570 --> 56:49.860
Well, it might continue
parallel to the new branch,

56:50.320 --> 56:52.370
but most likely it ceases to exist.

56:52.490 --> 56:54.990
The idea is, we cease to exist.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.750
All right? This version of us, anyway.

56:58.410 --> 57:00.620
You know, we never came here.
We didn't meet Doug.

57:00.750 --> 57:03.210
We don't remember it ever happening.

57:03.340 --> 57:05.670
Well, that's worth $ 10 billion
right there.

57:10.630 --> 57:13.350
Would've been a lot faster
if you'd written it yourself.

57:13.470 --> 57:15.310
Right. Then I recognise
my own handwriting

57:15.430 --> 57:17.390
and the universe blows up.

57:33.320 --> 57:34.370
We're ready.

57:34.490 --> 57:37.830
All right, third floor, southwest corner.
That's where we are.

57:39.500 --> 57:42.120
<i>-How'd you get that information?</i>
<i>-Good police work-</i>

57:42.250 --> 57:43.290
That's me. I can hear me.

57:43.420 --> 57:44.840
<i>-I don't wanna play games with you-</i>
-Where am I?

57:44.960 --> 57:46.210
<i>-I'm not playing games-</i>
<i>-Yeah, you are-</i>

57:46.340 --> 57:48.010
<i>-No, I'm not-</i>
<i>-There are protocols--- Yeah, you are-</i>

57:48.130 --> 57:50.380
-There I am.
-Is that Minuti?

57:50.510 --> 57:52.380
<i>-There's procedures---</i>
-Yep. That's my partner, Larry.

57:52.510 --> 57:54.600
<i>Look, I know how this job works,</i>
<i>you know how this job works-</i>

57:54.720 --> 57:56.560
Jesus, I forgot all about this part.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.600
All right, let's find a nice, happy place
to push the note onto.

57:59.730 --> 58:01.560
-That your desk?
-Yeah, that's my...

58:01.690 --> 58:03.270
Okay. Line us up.

58:03.600 --> 58:07.150
<i>When I peg a guy on a hunch,</i>
<i>that's good police work,</i>

58:07.270 --> 58:10.240
<i>not some conspiracy</i>
<i>to keep you out of the loop, all right?</i>

58:10.360 --> 58:12.570
<i>-You know what, Doug?</i>
-Okay, kid, start pushing.

58:12.700 --> 58:13.950
Expand the wave past the note.

58:14.070 --> 58:15.830
<i>I can't watch your back</i>
<i>if you're holding out on me-</i>

58:15.950 --> 58:16.990
<i>Why not?</i>

58:17.120 --> 58:19.080
If my memory serves me right,
we better hurry up,

58:19.200 --> 58:20.700
'cause I think I'm about to leave.

58:20.830 --> 58:22.500
-I need more cowbell.
-I'm trying.

58:22.620 --> 58:23.920
<i>-Okay, well, l---</i>
-Good!

58:24.040 --> 58:25.040
Just give me a second.

58:25.170 --> 58:27.250
-Don't talk to each other.
-Expand.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.380
I'm about to leave.

58:28.500 --> 58:30.090
<i>---another partner?</i>
<i>How about that? How about that?</i>

58:30.210 --> 58:31.800
-Everybody relax.
<i>-Okay- Yeah-</i>

58:31.920 --> 58:33.090
-Let's go.
-I'm working on it.

58:33.220 --> 58:34.890
Prepare for the final power surge.
Ready?

58:35.010 --> 58:38.260
<i>-Have a good vacation-</i>
-All right. Go, go, go!

58:39.930 --> 58:41.350
<i>Walk away-</i>

58:51.820 --> 58:53.950
-What the hell happened?
-I don't know.

58:54.070 --> 58:55.870
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Pull it back!

58:55.990 --> 58:57.620
-Did it go through?
-I don't know! I don't know!

58:57.740 --> 58:58.780
Pull it back.

59:07.080 --> 59:08.790
-There it is.
-It went through.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.300
-That's right.
-It's through.

59:10.420 --> 59:11.630
-It went through!
-Great.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.340
Whoa, whoa.
No, wait a minute. Hang on.

59:13.470 --> 59:15.470
It ain't great yet. I don't come back.

59:30.480 --> 59:33.240
Put it down, Larry. I'm not coming back.

59:41.450 --> 59:43.160
Put it down, Larry.

59:44.370 --> 59:46.120
Larry, don't do it.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.170
-Follow him.
-I'm on him.

1:00:08.850 --> 1:00:12.820
All right, look, let's... You know what?
Let's cut away from Minuti.

1:00:12.940 --> 1:00:15.360
The bomber's on his way to the dock.
He's due there any minute.

1:00:15.490 --> 1:00:18.530
We'll come back to Minuti
when he gets there, all right?

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:23.540
All right.

1:00:24.330 --> 1:00:26.000
Okay, where is he?

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:31.750
Can we circle it?

1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:38.380
We should be able to see him by now.

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:47.940
That's him. There he is. All right.

1:00:48.060 --> 1:00:49.560
-Holy shit.
-All right.

1:00:49.690 --> 1:00:52.060
Move in on him real close.
I want to see his... That's him.

1:00:52.190 --> 1:00:53.520
That's him.

1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:58.070
That's our guy. That's him.
At the bridge, the cemetery, the ATM.

1:00:58.200 --> 1:00:59.200
That's our guy.

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:01.370
Shanti, see if you can get
an ID, facial ID on him.

1:01:01.490 --> 1:01:04.410
-Give me some time.
-Okay. All right. Take your time.

1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.170
-There's your partner.
-I see him.

1:01:10.290 --> 1:01:11.750
Try to move in on his truck.

1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:13.540
See if we can get a plate.

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.510
-No plate.
-Get back on him.

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:22.220
Stay on him.

1:01:26.970 --> 1:01:28.390
Where's Minuti?

1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:30.810
<i>Federal agent! Turn the engine off!</i>

1:01:30.940 --> 1:01:33.310
<i>Turn the engine off!</i>

1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:49.830
Tilt back down.

1:01:51.830 --> 1:01:53.630
He's still breathing.

1:02:09.730 --> 1:02:13.270
-What can we do?
-I don't know what to do.

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:18.360
He's travelling east.
He's travelling out of range.

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:21.150
-Okay, what can we do? Anything?
-I don't know,

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:23.990
but if we don't do something fast,
I'm gonna lose this guy.

1:02:24.110 --> 1:02:25.740
We're losing the signal.

1:02:25.870 --> 1:02:26.990
We have to boost the signal.

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:29.330
We need to chase him
with the goggle rig.

1:02:29.450 --> 1:02:31.080
Yeah, well,
Gunnars is a little busy right now,

1:02:31.210 --> 1:02:33.420
and he's the only one who can use it.

1:02:35.330 --> 1:02:36.920
-Where is it?
-What, the rig? It's...

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:39.880
-Yeah, the rig. Where is it?
-It's in his Hummer.

1:02:43.510 --> 1:02:45.390
-Keys in there?
-Yeah.

1:03:11.580 --> 1:03:11.910
All right, quiet, everybody. It's him.

1:03:11.870 --> 1:03:13.660
All right, quiet, everybody. It's him.

1:03:14.370 --> 1:03:16.460
-Carlin.
-Where's he now?

1:03:16.630 --> 1:03:19.840
-Is he going east?
-Yes.

1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:22.210
Okay, he's going east,
going up on De Gaulle.

1:03:24.130 --> 1:03:26.840
All right, just try to keep him in sight,
and keep feeding me directions.

1:03:26.930 --> 1:03:29.680
I'll try and track him
with this goggle rig.

1:03:29.810 --> 1:03:31.970
-Can he do that?
-Yeah, if he can catch up to the image

1:03:32.100 --> 1:03:34.600
and keep him in sight, that could work.

1:03:37.650 --> 1:03:39.360
Hey, how do you turn this thing on?

1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:42.400
There's an on-off button
on the back of the rig.

1:03:42.530 --> 1:03:43.530
Okay, I see it.

1:03:43.650 --> 1:03:46.360
It's really simple. Wherever you look,
the eyepiece will auto-focus,

1:03:46.450 --> 1:03:48.490
and we'll see what you see.

1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:54.000
Okay, you're live. You're on.

1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:56.620
<i>-Try the goggles-</i>
-Hang on, hang on.

1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:03.090
-He's gone. Out of range.
-What?

1:04:03.210 --> 1:04:05.840
-Where's he headed?
<i>-He's headed toward the l- 10-</i>

1:04:05.970 --> 1:04:07.550
East or west?

1:04:08.010 --> 1:04:10.260
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

1:04:10.390 --> 1:04:11.850
East or west?

1:04:11.970 --> 1:04:13.770
We lost the signal. We're blind in here.

1:04:13.890 --> 1:04:16.440
<i>-I don't know-</i>
-All right, hang on.

1:04:19.190 --> 1:04:20.770
Oh, shit!

1:04:22.650 --> 1:04:25.360
What? What happened?
What happened?

1:04:30.950 --> 1:04:32.490
This is trippy.

1:04:32.620 --> 1:04:33.700
Doug, look straight ahead.

1:04:33.830 --> 1:04:35.290
We've got the window slaved
to your goggles.

1:04:35.410 --> 1:04:38.420
We are seeing what you're seeing
four days in the past.

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:41.840
Okay, I got him. I got him.
He's back in range.

1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:43.380
He's going west, not east,

1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:45.420
<i>on the Crescent City Bridge-</i>

1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:50.510
There he is. That's him. Opposite lane.

1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:53.220
-I got him.
-That's him. That's him.

1:04:53.350 --> 1:04:54.720
I got him!

1:04:55.980 --> 1:04:57.770
Watch the traffic.

1:05:07.030 --> 1:05:08.860
-What was that?
-I think he hit something.

1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:15.700
Doug, you've gotta stay with him.
You're gonna lose him again.

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:17.790
Doug, what's happening?

1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:24.630
I got him! I got him.

1:05:26.170 --> 1:05:27.470
All right, all right, all right.

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:29.510
Good. Now stay with him.

1:05:29.930 --> 1:05:32.720
Send paramedics
to the Crescent City Bridge.

1:05:32.850 --> 1:05:34.260
Got that?

1:05:36.930 --> 1:05:38.350
I lost him.

1:05:47.690 --> 1:05:49.950
-I got him! I got him!
-All right. All right.

1:05:50.070 --> 1:05:51.280
That's him.

1:05:51.410 --> 1:05:53.620
He's headed for the 10 to the bayou.

1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:16.390
I can see him. He's right in front of me.

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:26.570
Carlin!

1:06:27.070 --> 1:06:28.690
What was that?
What the hell was that?

1:06:28.820 --> 1:06:30.490
Doug, are you all right?

1:06:33.910 --> 1:06:35.160
<i>Doug!</i>

1:06:35.950 --> 1:06:37.030
Doug?

1:06:38.830 --> 1:06:41.160
I think it's broken. I can't see anything.

1:06:41.290 --> 1:06:44.290
We still have a signal here.
You're still transmitting.

1:06:44.630 --> 1:06:47.090
-You can see?
-We'll talk you through it.

1:06:47.210 --> 1:06:49.210
Can you still drive?

1:06:49.340 --> 1:06:50.710
Yeah, yeah. Where is he?

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:53.220
Give us a 360 with the goggle rig.

1:06:54.390 --> 1:06:56.970
There! There he is!
Pan the thing around.

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:58.850
-Which way?
<i>-To your right-</i>

1:06:58.970 --> 1:07:00.430
To your right.

1:07:01.730 --> 1:07:03.480
There! There he is!

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:06.360
-He's taking the road to the bayou!
-Right there?

1:07:06.900 --> 1:07:08.190
The road is blocked.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.030
Take the expressway.
It parallels the road.

1:07:10.150 --> 1:07:11.570
Go. Go, go!

1:07:25.250 --> 1:07:26.250
See him?

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:27.920
Pan right. Pan right!

1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:30.500
You still see him?

1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:32.300
He's at the end of the bridge.

1:07:32.420 --> 1:07:34.970
-You hear me?
-He's at the end of the bridge.

1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:41.020
Keep talking to me.

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:45.140
I don't know what else to tell you.
I feel very, very close to you right now.

1:07:45.270 --> 1:07:47.440
He took the exit ramp beneath you.

1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:50.480
-Take the next off-ramp.
-Take the next off-ramp!

1:07:52.490 --> 1:07:55.070
All right, I'm on the off-ramp.

1:07:55.780 --> 1:07:57.490
Go right, then double back on yourself.

1:07:57.620 --> 1:07:59.330
All right, I got it.

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:03.910
All right, take another right.

1:08:09.340 --> 1:08:11.050
Still see him?

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:14.300
He's heading to the bayou.
Take a left here.

1:08:20.180 --> 1:08:21.890
Good, good, good.

1:08:22.010 --> 1:08:23.600
<i>Take it easy, Doug-</i>
<i>He's dead ahead of you-</i>

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:23.890
Okay, okay, okay.

1:08:23.850 --> 1:08:25.270
Okay, okay, okay.

1:08:32.230 --> 1:08:35.070
He's slowing down, coming to a fence.
Do you see it?

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:39.780
Yeah, I see it.

1:08:54.460 --> 1:08:56.550
<i>Doug, if you're gonna leave</i>
<i>the Hummer, take the backpack-</i>

1:08:56.670 --> 1:08:58.760
<i>It's the power source for the rig-</i>

1:09:26.540 --> 1:09:28.250
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:09:28.370 --> 1:09:30.420
Yeah, we can hear you.
We can hear you.

1:09:30.670 --> 1:09:31.710
All right.

1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:43.600
What's he doing now?

1:09:46.890 --> 1:09:48.100
He's pulled around
the back of the building.

1:09:48.060 --> 1:09:49.390
He's pulled around
the back of the building.

1:09:52.980 --> 1:09:55.070
Looks like a bomb went off.

1:09:55.190 --> 1:09:58.860
Really?
We see an intact structure here.

1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:02.780
-No damage?
<i>-No, none-</i>

1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:06.830
Looks like a vehicle's inside.

1:10:06.950 --> 1:10:08.830
An ambulance. You see that?

1:10:09.830 --> 1:10:11.870
No. Nothing.

1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:36.900
See anything?

1:10:37.650 --> 1:10:39.740
He's dead ahead of you.

1:10:39.860 --> 1:10:41.740
Doug, he's pulling Minuti out of the car.

1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:42.910
Where?

1:10:43.030 --> 1:10:45.070
All right, now pan to the right.
Pan to the right.

1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:46.410
-More right.
-You got him.

1:10:46.530 --> 1:10:48.040
Yeah, he's dragging him out of the car.

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:49.410
Do you see him?

1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:51.790
-Yeah.
-Yes. Right in front of you.

1:10:51.910 --> 1:10:53.710
Boost the audio for me.

1:10:53.830 --> 1:10:55.380
Audio boosted.

1:10:55.840 --> 1:10:58.300
<i>Turn around- Turn around behind you-</i>

1:10:59.210 --> 1:11:01.130
-Larry?
<i>-Pan back to the right-</i>

1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:03.090
-You've got him now.
<i>-Where is he?</i>

1:11:03.220 --> 1:11:05.300
He's being dragged on the concrete.

1:11:07.890 --> 1:11:09.220
Larry!

1:11:13.850 --> 1:11:15.480
What's that sound?

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:17.980
<i>What's the sound?</i>

1:11:18.690 --> 1:11:22.820
He's pouring some kind of accelerant
over Agent Minuti.

1:11:22.950 --> 1:11:26.240
I think it's the diesel fuel,
like at the ferry.

1:11:35.250 --> 1:11:36.880
He's waking up.

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:40.210
Brace yourselves. I think
you're about to witness a murder.

1:12:53.580 --> 1:12:55.580
If we hadn't sent him there,
he wouldn't be dead now.

1:12:55.700 --> 1:12:58.460
No, he was already dead from the ferry.
We just changed how he died.

1:12:58.580 --> 1:12:59.670
We don't know that.

1:12:59.790 --> 1:13:01.130
He could've been standing
right next to you,

1:13:01.250 --> 1:13:02.250
right until we sent that note.

1:13:02.380 --> 1:13:04.630
<i>You'd need a branching</i>
<i>multiple universe for that to happen-</i>

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:07.510
<i>Oh, come on-</i>
<i>We can't change anything-</i>

1:13:07.630 --> 1:13:10.930
We didn't change anything.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

1:13:11.050 --> 1:13:13.060
I'll tell you what we did.

1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:16.930
The suspect used a stolen Blazer
to case the dock.

1:13:17.060 --> 1:13:21.020
So now he has a truck big enough
to drive a bomb onto the ferry.

1:13:21.650 --> 1:13:23.610
<i>Now Larry shows up, right?</i>

1:13:24.230 --> 1:13:27.070
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield.

1:13:27.190 --> 1:13:29.740
-You want a mask?
-No. No, I'm good, thanks.

1:13:29.860 --> 1:13:31.870
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield,

1:13:31.990 --> 1:13:35.290
<i>leaves blood all over the back seat,</i>
<i>so now our bomber needs a new truck,</i>

1:13:35.410 --> 1:13:37.790
you understand? Claire's truck.

1:13:39.750 --> 1:13:41.080
<i>You hungry?</i>

1:13:41.210 --> 1:13:42.290
Yeah, we changed one thing,

1:13:42.420 --> 1:13:45.130
but by changing one thing,
we didn't change anything.

1:13:45.250 --> 1:13:46.920
<i>What's on TV?</i>

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:25.040

-Who is that?
-Owner of that bait camp Doug found.

1:16:07.650 --> 1:16:10.020
and if it's all right with you,
I'd like to use this interview

1:16:10.150 --> 1:16:13.860
to educate my colleagues
in law enforcement.

1:16:13.990 --> 1:16:16.570
-Yes, sir.
-Good. Good.

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:18.070
Let's talk about motive.

1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:20.490
Why would you use explosives
against the US Navy?

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:27.420
-Correction, sir. US Government.
-US Government.

1:16:28.250 --> 1:16:31.550
It says here that you tried
to enlist in the Marines.

1:16:31.670 --> 1:16:33.510
You were rejected.
You tried to enlist in the Army,

1:16:33.630 --> 1:16:35.630
you were rejected again.

1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:38.010
Why do you think they did that?

1:16:39.550 --> 1:16:41.890
Because they don't want patriots.

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:45.680
The military no longer recognises
commitment and purpose.

1:16:46.230 --> 1:16:50.190
They thought I was overcommitted
and psychologically unstable.

1:16:51.110 --> 1:16:53.150
They didn't want to understand
my value.

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:55.110
They understand it now.

1:16:55.740 --> 1:16:57.700
I believe so. Yes, sir.

1:17:01.370 --> 1:17:03.740
-You're ATF, right?
-Yes, I am.

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:07.080
-Got a smoke?
-No, I don't. But I can get you one.

1:17:07.210 --> 1:17:08.670
-Would you like one?
-Yes.

1:17:08.790 --> 1:17:11.540
Okay. Anything you want to say,
just talk into the mike.

1:17:11.670 --> 1:17:14.880
A man can always use more alcohol,
tobacco and firearms.

1:17:15.010 --> 1:17:17.010
I can think of one more thing.

1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:22.850
<i>It's like the Revolutionary War,</i>
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

1:17:22.970 --> 1:17:26.060
<i>"One man's terrorist</i>
<i>is another man's patriot, " isn't it?</i>

1:17:26.810 --> 1:17:28.850
<i>-Yeah?</i>
<i>-Exactly-</i>

1:17:28.980 --> 1:17:30.560
<i>-Yeah-</i>
<i>-You get it-</i>

1:17:32.690 --> 1:17:35.690
-This wasn't about revenge.
-What was it about?

1:17:38.780 --> 1:17:39.950
Destiny.

1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:41.490
Destiny?

1:17:42.780 --> 1:17:44.410
You've been asking me
about my motives.

1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:46.040
-Right. Right.
-My methods.

1:17:47.450 --> 1:17:49.000
They're all connected.

1:17:49.790 --> 1:17:51.250
Everything's connected.

1:17:51.380 --> 1:17:53.630
Okay.
How was Claire Kuchever connected?

1:17:53.750 --> 1:17:55.210
I needed a car.

1:17:55.340 --> 1:17:56.880
-And that's it?
-No, well, something

1:17:57.010 --> 1:17:58.920
-that couldn't be traced back to me.
-Right.

1:17:59.050 --> 1:18:01.800
I had one ready till that cop showed up.

1:18:02.470 --> 1:18:05.100
That cop was a federal agent.

1:18:05.220 --> 1:18:07.560
Lawrence Minuti. My partner.
You shot him.

1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:10.600
He... I was about to burn him
and he was waking up, you know?

1:18:10.730 --> 1:18:12.310
I mean, I'm not cruel.

1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:19.110
Well, why didn't you "do that"
for Claire Kuchever?

1:18:20.650 --> 1:18:26.120
Well, because I needed her
to look like a ferry victim,

1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:28.620
-and a bullet would've given it away.
-I see.

1:18:28.750 --> 1:18:32.040
I went to her house
on the pretence of buying her car.

1:18:32.170 --> 1:18:35.380
I took her from behind, taped her mouth
and threw a hood over her head.

1:18:35.500 --> 1:18:36.500
Then?

1:18:36.630 --> 1:18:39.590
<i>I bound her wrists and her ankles</i>
<i>and I drove her back to my place-</i>

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:41.510
<i>I loaded the device into her car</i>

1:18:41.630 --> 1:18:43.180
<i>and then I soaked her</i>
<i>with the gasoline-</i>

1:18:43.300 --> 1:18:44.390
Jesus.

1:18:44.510 --> 1:18:45.510
And?

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:47.140
I think you know
what happened after that.

1:18:47.260 --> 1:18:49.140
No, I don't know. I want you to tell me.
You gotta talk.

1:18:49.270 --> 1:18:51.310
I mean, you know, come on, hero.
What happened after that?

1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:52.560
I'll tell you what happened after that.

1:18:52.690 --> 1:18:56.110
You killed 543 people.
How do you feel about that?

1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:04.870
I think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning.

1:19:07.370 --> 1:19:10.960
Sometimes a little human collateral
is the cost of freedom.

1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:12.920
To me,
those people were war casualties,

1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:14.920
<i>but to you, they're just evidence-</i>

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.460
That'll do. We got him.

1:19:17.590 --> 1:19:18.630
<i>What'd you say?</i>

1:19:18.750 --> 1:19:22.510
You think you know what's coming?
You don't have a clue.

1:19:22.630 --> 1:19:24.590
I know where you're going.

1:19:25.010 --> 1:19:28.680
I know you're gonna be away
for a long time. I know that.

1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:32.180
-This case will never even go to trial.
-No?

1:19:33.730 --> 1:19:36.730
-'Cause I seen what's coming.
-Did... Have you? What?

1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:40.690
What is in this glass?
You've seen what's coming, huh?

1:19:40.820 --> 1:19:42.860
Okay, what's coming? You tell me.

1:19:43.860 --> 1:19:46.570
I told you earlier I have a destiny,

1:19:46.660 --> 1:19:47.950
a purpose.

1:19:48.660 --> 1:19:51.750
Satan reasons like man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1:19:52.330 --> 1:19:56.880
Well, I prostrate myself before a world
that's going to hell in a handbag,

1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:00.050
'cause in all eternity,
I am here and I will be remembered.

1:20:00.170 --> 1:20:01.760
That's destiny.

1:20:02.470 --> 1:20:04.220
A bomb has a destiny,

1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:07.850
a predetermined fate
set by the hand of its creator.

1:20:07.970 --> 1:20:11.220
And anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed.

1:20:11.350 --> 1:20:14.730
Anyone who tries to stop it
from happening will cause it to happen.

1:20:14.850 --> 1:20:16.730
And that's what you don't understand.

1:20:16.850 --> 1:20:20.650
We're not here to coexist.
I'm here to win.

1:20:21.030 --> 1:20:23.860
So you'd better have
some divine intervention, buddy.

1:20:24.650 --> 1:20:26.780
You're gonna need it.

1:20:27.110 --> 1:20:30.620
You'd better have some K-Y.
You're gonna need it.

1:20:42.550 --> 1:20:44.590
What am I supposed to do?

1:20:45.970 --> 1:20:48.340
-We're shutting you down.
-What?

1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:49.850
Yeah, we got what we need.

1:20:49.970 --> 1:20:52.430
The forensics, the suspect,
a confession. We're done.

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:56.020
Sir, perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime.

1:20:56.140 --> 1:20:57.690
-The ferry bombing.
-Right. He's right.

1:20:57.810 --> 1:20:59.900
I mean, we can't just
go on the confession alone.

1:21:00.020 --> 1:21:02.230
We need an airtight case.
We need to collect more evidence.

1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:04.610
Well, collecting evidence
would've been fine, Agent Carly.

1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:07.280
-You took it a little further than that.
-Agent Carlin. Carlin.

1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:08.490
My name is Carlin, not Carly.

1:21:08.610 --> 1:21:11.160
We had protocols in place.
There's strict protocols.

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:13.990
And then you had to push it,
and now an agent's dead.

1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:16.330
Sir, by one theory,
that already happened.

1:21:16.460 --> 1:21:19.710
We're done. Power it down.
Pack it up. On to the next case.

1:21:20.420 --> 1:21:22.210
-What about Claire?
-What...

1:21:22.750 --> 1:21:24.760
Lookit, charging Oerstadt
in the Kuchever murder

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:27.470
is gonna raise too many questions
about how we obtained the evidence.

1:21:27.590 --> 1:21:28.970
I understand that, sir,
but what about Claire?

1:21:29.090 --> 1:21:30.140
Are we just gonna drop the case?

1:21:30.260 --> 1:21:32.680
We got him on the ferry bombing,
we got him on killing a federal agent.

1:21:32.810 --> 1:21:35.060
-That's enough to get him the needle.
-I cannot accept that, sir.

1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:37.640
Well, you know, I don't give a rat's ass
what you can accept.

1:21:37.770 --> 1:21:40.190
-She doesn't matter.
-He's gonna kill her.

1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:44.020
-In 12 hours, he's gonna kill her.
-He killed her four days ago.

1:21:44.150 --> 1:21:46.780
You were at the funeral.
What's wrong with you?

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.280
It had to happen.

1:21:52.450 --> 1:21:55.740
I delayed turning in my report
till we caught the guy.

1:21:56.450 --> 1:21:58.160
Hey, mission accomplished.

1:21:58.620 --> 1:22:00.750
This is a victory, Doug.

1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:10.840
Hey. Now, my job is closure.

1:22:10.970 --> 1:22:13.470
Your job is to help facilitate
that closure.

1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:15.850
Then you tell me,
what do I tell her father?

1:22:15.970 --> 1:22:18.020
We caught the son of a bitch.

1:22:18.140 --> 1:22:19.270
We can't save the victims.

1:22:19.390 --> 1:22:22.610
It's not our job
to make the relatives feel better.

1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:27.190
We lose everything that we care about.
Those are your words.

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:31.280
Doug, it's not your fault
that Claire dies.

1:22:33.820 --> 1:22:35.780
Yeah, that's one theory.

1:22:40.330 --> 1:22:43.130
<i>Lieutenant Junior Grade Dianne Kerry-</i>

1:22:43.540 --> 1:22:45.290
<i>Martin Kyle-</i>

1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:49.220
<i>Commander Francis Lacey, retired-</i>

1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:51.510
<i>Elaine Lacey-</i>

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:55.350
<i>Chief Petty Officer Darren McAndrews-</i>

1:22:56.180 --> 1:22:58.270
<i>Lorraine McAndrews-</i>

1:22:59.430 --> 1:23:02.350
<i>Electronics Technician Lisa Melville-</i>

1:23:02.980 --> 1:23:05.770
<i>Chaplain Rabbi</i>
<i>Benjamin Mendelsson-</i>

1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:24.350
Denny? It's Doug.

1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:27.100
Well, I can't say
I wasn't expecting this call.

1:24:27.900 --> 1:24:30.400
Look, you know what happens
if you try this.

1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:32.110
We both know what happens if I don't.

1:24:32.230 --> 1:24:36.570
Well, not a lot of guinea pigs volunteer
to die in the name of science.

1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:38.160
Well, then we have to make sure

1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:40.530
I end up somewhere
besides the morgue.

1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:42.540
Can you help me?

1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:49.380
I'll see you when you get here.

1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:51.920
Doug?

1:24:58.050 --> 1:25:03.020
Do me a favour.
When you finish, turn off the lights.

1:25:23.490 --> 1:25:26.960
You do that one more time,
you set off every alarm in the joint.

1:25:31.380 --> 1:25:32.460
Can't take it.

1:25:32.630 --> 1:25:34.170
Gotta keep the mass
as low as possible.

1:25:34.300 --> 1:25:36.380
You gotta take everything off.

1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:45.140
-You can keep your underwear on.
-Thank you very much.

1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:49.480
Thought you said you didn't believe
in changing the past.

1:25:49.850 --> 1:25:52.480
Right. Well, I also believe in God.

1:25:52.610 --> 1:25:53.980
Just don't tell anyone.

1:25:54.110 --> 1:25:56.240
-I'm gonna tell everybody.
-Yeah?

1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:59.200
You know, when I open up the throttle
on this thing...

1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:02.700
Yeah, I know. EM field, flatline. I got it.

1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:05.870
Thing of it is,
no matter how clever we think we are,

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.540
the most probable outcome
of our little experiment

1:26:08.660 --> 1:26:12.380
is that four and a half days ago
you get a call from the coroner's office.

1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:14.670
"Hey, Agent Carlin,
I want you to come down here.

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:16.510
"There's something you should see."

1:26:16.630 --> 1:26:19.590
And next thing you know,
you're standing over a corpse

1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:21.140
and it's you.

1:26:21.550 --> 1:26:26.850
Well, you can be wrong a million times.
You only gotta be right once.

1:26:26.970 --> 1:26:29.270
Besides, I think I'd remember
if that happened, right?

1:26:29.390 --> 1:26:31.400
So I gotta face out toward you?

1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:34.360
Yeah, face out.
Just like the note, only bigger.

1:26:35.900 --> 1:26:38.030
-You ready?
-No.

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:41.660
You don't have to do this.

1:26:43.370 --> 1:26:45.200
What if I already have?

1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:47.160
Right.

1:27:00.510 --> 1:27:01.550
Doug?

1:27:03.590 --> 1:27:04.640
<i>Doug?</i>

1:27:04.970 --> 1:27:07.520
Hey. Hello?

1:27:07.770 --> 1:27:09.730
-You okay in there?
<i>-Yeah-</i>

1:27:09.890 --> 1:27:11.640
-You good?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

1:27:11.770 --> 1:27:14.360
I'm beside myself.

1:27:17.110 --> 1:27:18.900
<i>Am I still here?</i>

1:27:19.030 --> 1:27:20.360
For now. You ready?

1:27:20.490 --> 1:27:22.030
<i>-Yeah, I'm ready-</i>
-All right.

1:27:22.150 --> 1:27:23.910
<i>Looking forward to walking up to you</i>
<i>four days ago</i>

1:27:24.030 --> 1:27:25.160
<i>and blowing your mind, though-</i>

1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:26.660
Well, if that happens,
maybe you can tell me

1:27:26.780 --> 1:27:28.120
what it's like to meet your younger self.

1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:30.080
<i>All right, I'll let you know-</i>

1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:34.920
All right, remember, the ferry blows
at 10:50 on Fat Tuesday, okay?

1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:36.920
<i>Yeah-</i>

1:27:38.210 --> 1:27:39.550
Here we go.

1:27:40.670 --> 1:27:41.880
See you yesterday.

1:27:42.010 --> 1:27:43.340
God willing.

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:09.240
<i>Good, good-</i>

1:28:09.370 --> 1:28:10.740
<i>-You don't have to do this-</i>
<i>-Hello?</i>

1:28:10.870 --> 1:28:11.910
<i>Maybe I already have-</i>

1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:13.540
<i>Maybe I already have-</i>

1:28:16.670 --> 1:28:18.340
-What the hell?
-All right, hold on, everybody.

1:28:18.460 --> 1:28:21.170
The reserve generators should kick in.
Nobody move.

1:28:21.630 --> 1:28:23.470
That was interesting.

1:28:27.010 --> 1:28:28.510
-Doctor!
-Who the hell is that?

1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:30.470
Where'd he come from?

1:28:31.970 --> 1:28:35.310
All right, let's get him into Trauma.
Trauma 2, Trauma 2!

1:28:40.230 --> 1:28:41.780
This is weird.

1:28:43.990 --> 1:28:45.490
-Defib.
-Clear!

1:28:46.030 --> 1:28:47.820
Recharge it again.

1:28:48.620 --> 1:28:49.830
Clear!

1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:52.120
-Recharge to 300.
-Charging.

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:53.830
Clear!

1:28:55.540 --> 1:29:00.090
Resume CPR. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

1:29:26.150 --> 1:29:27.740
<i>---thirty-four degrees-</i>

1:29:27.860 --> 1:29:30.370
<i>Forty-nine was our low temperature</i>
<i>at the airport-</i>

1:29:30.490 --> 1:29:33.870
<i>Gonna be at that</i>
<i>or just maybe above that for tonight-</i>

1:29:33.990 --> 1:29:36.620
<i>Let me show you why-</i>
<i>Look, the winds are starting---</i>

1:29:55.470 --> 1:29:59.310
-...a few of them come back.
-I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:01.650
-Whoa!
-I'm a federal agent.

1:30:01.770 --> 1:30:04.110
I need your keys. I need a vehicle.

1:30:04.230 --> 1:30:05.860
There's keys in the truck there.

1:30:05.990 --> 1:30:07.990
Which one? Right here?
Put your hands down.

1:30:08.110 --> 1:30:11.320
Hands on the table.
Hold your doughnut. Hands right there.

1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:14.330
Water it.

1:30:36.310 --> 1:30:39.140
<i>This might be a metaphor</i>
<i>for existence itself-</i>

1:30:39.270 --> 1:30:44.690
<i>A fish struggles instinctively</i>
<i>against an almost formless antagonist-</i>

1:30:44.820 --> 1:30:46.690
<i>The fish is a largemouth bass-</i>

1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:03.130
<i>Here's the news at 8:30-</i>

1:31:03.330 --> 1:31:06.210
<i>Federal officials are still baffled</i>
<i>by the massive blackout</i>

1:31:06.340 --> 1:31:10.220
<i>that darkened the entire eastern half</i>
<i>of the country early this morning-</i>

1:33:05.250 --> 1:33:06.420
Hey!

1:34:28.370 --> 1:34:29.750
Jesus.

1:34:36.130 --> 1:34:39.010
Wait a minute.
Hey, it's okay. Wait a minute!

1:34:39.130 --> 1:34:40.890
Listen. Claire!

1:34:41.010 --> 1:34:43.850
I'm a federal agent. Hang on, hang on.

1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:46.350
All right, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1:34:46.470 --> 1:34:49.020
I'm a federal agent. It's okay. It's okay.

1:34:50.190 --> 1:34:51.940
You're safe. You're all right, okay?

1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:56.320
I'm a federal agent. You're safe.
You're safe. Look at me. Come here.

1:34:56.440 --> 1:34:58.690
You're safe. He's gone. All right?

1:35:01.070 --> 1:35:03.490
-Get me out of here!
-All right. All right.

1:35:03.620 --> 1:35:05.370
Get me out of here!

1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:09.250
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.

1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:13.710
-Get me out of here.
-All right, let me get your feet.

1:35:13.830 --> 1:35:16.550
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

1:35:19.300 --> 1:35:21.680
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.090
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

1:35:24.220 --> 1:35:25.680
All right.

1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:43.160
How'd you know
there'd be keys in this truck?

1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:46.080
That's a good question. I didn't know.

1:35:49.750 --> 1:35:51.790
-He's a terrorist?
-Yeah.

1:35:51.910 --> 1:35:56.290
His name is Carroll Oerstadt.
I'm a part of a special surveillance unit.

1:35:56.420 --> 1:35:57.920
We've been tracking him.

1:35:58.050 --> 1:36:02.380
He's planning on blowing up
the Canal Street Ferry today at 10:50.

1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:08.600
-So we're going to the police?
-No, it's too complicated.

1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:10.890
By the time we get them up to speed,
the ferry will be gone.

1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:12.640
We gotta go
straight to the Algiers dock.

1:36:12.770 --> 1:36:15.150
I don't think you're gonna make it.
You're losing too much blood.

1:36:15.270 --> 1:36:18.650
No, I gotta make it. I only got an hour
and 40 minutes to catch up to this guy.

1:36:18.770 --> 1:36:22.190
What if you don't make it?
What happens then?

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.280
If I don't make it...

1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:27.700
What?

1:36:28.830 --> 1:36:29.870
Your house is on the way.

1:36:29.990 --> 1:36:31.620
We'll go by your house,
and I'll get cleaned up.

1:36:31.750 --> 1:36:35.540
-I'll drop you off. All right?
-All right.

1:36:36.670 --> 1:36:38.170
Hey, Ginger.

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.800
She hates strangers.

1:36:41.050 --> 1:36:42.130
You need anything?

1:36:42.260 --> 1:36:44.180
You get cleaned up.
I'll take care of this.

1:36:44.300 --> 1:36:47.640
-You sure? I could bind that for you.
-No, I'm sure. You go ahead.

1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:50.390
I'm gonna need to borrow
one of your boyfriend's jackets, though.

1:36:50.510 --> 1:36:51.560
Sure.

1:37:38.900 --> 1:37:40.860
Hey, listen.

1:37:40.980 --> 1:37:43.570
-You shouldn't wear that.
-What?

1:37:44.570 --> 1:37:45.900
Why don't you put on a different one?

1:37:46.030 --> 1:37:49.200
The blue and white one. Anything.
It's just...

1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:50.320
Just trust me.

1:37:50.450 --> 1:37:54.580
The victim wore a dress like that
and it wouldn't be good.

1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:57.920
-Okay.
-Trust me.

1:37:58.290 --> 1:38:02.840
All right, I'll go change. I'll be right out.

1:38:13.310 --> 1:38:15.100
Stop right there! Don't move!

1:38:15.220 --> 1:38:17.350
Don't move. I'm calling the police.

1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:19.230
-I am the police.
-No, you're not.

1:38:19.350 --> 1:38:20.650
-Yes, I am.
-No, you're not!

1:38:20.770 --> 1:38:23.480
You didn't ask me any questions.
You didn't take a statement.

1:38:23.610 --> 1:38:26.940
And you knew where my house was,
what's in my closet.

1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:31.200
-Who are you?
-I'm Doug Carlin. I'm an ATF agent.

1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:34.030
I'm part of a special surveillance unit
that's been tracking the man

1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:35.830
-who was trying to kill you.
-How do I know that?

1:38:35.950 --> 1:38:37.540
I had a hood over my head.
You could be him.

1:38:37.660 --> 1:38:38.660
Just think about it, Claire.

1:38:38.790 --> 1:38:40.460
Look at my face.
You scratched the man's face.

1:38:40.580 --> 1:38:42.290
Do I have a scratch on my face?

1:38:42.420 --> 1:38:46.260
-You scratched him, didn't you?
-Get on the floor.

1:38:47.380 --> 1:38:48.970
Now! Get on the floor!

1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:53.800
All the way!

1:38:56.970 --> 1:38:59.060
ATF New Orleans, Agent Donnelly.

1:38:59.190 --> 1:39:03.310
Yes, is there an Agent Douglas Carlin
working out of that branch?

1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:05.900
<i>Yes, there is,</i>
<i>but he's not here right now-</i>

1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:08.030
Would you like to leave a message?

1:39:08.150 --> 1:39:10.150
Can you describe him for me, please?

1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:12.110
How tall, skin colour.

1:39:12.910 --> 1:39:17.790
I don't know.
He's 6'3", black, not bad-looking.

1:39:20.660 --> 1:39:23.170
Okay, have him call me back

1:39:23.290 --> 1:39:26.750
at 877-504-8423.

1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:28.460
Okay, wait. My phone pad's empty.

1:39:28.590 --> 1:39:29.920
All right, got it.

1:39:31.550 --> 1:39:32.590
Hello?

1:39:37.770 --> 1:39:38.930
Get up.

1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:48.530
Are you gonna tell me the truth?

1:39:48.650 --> 1:39:51.780
Are you gonna tell me why you're here,
why this is happening

1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:54.530
and none of it makes sense?
None of it.

1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:59.040
What if you had to tell someone
the most important thing in the world,

1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:01.370
but you knew they'd never believe you?

1:40:03.250 --> 1:40:04.500
What would you do?

1:40:05.580 --> 1:40:06.670
I'd try.

1:40:07.750 --> 1:40:10.550
You never know
what someone might believe.

1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:21.270
I don't understand what's...
What's happening.

1:40:45.750 --> 1:40:47.540
I gotta hurry up and get down there.

1:40:47.670 --> 1:40:49.590
Why are you the only one
who can stop him?

1:40:49.550 --> 1:40:50.340
Why are you the only one
who can stop him?

1:40:50.460 --> 1:40:52.340
Well, because I'm the only one
that knows his plan.

1:40:52.470 --> 1:40:54.180
I'm the only one that knows
where he's gonna be

1:40:54.300 --> 1:40:55.930
and exactly what he's gonna do.

1:40:56.050 --> 1:40:57.600
How do you know that?

1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:00.260
I mean, how'd you know
those things about me?

1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:02.350
Well, for the sake of argument,

1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:04.940
let's just say that the government
has a special device

1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:08.940
that allows me to know
what's gonna happen ahead of time.

1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:11.730
Then how come you didn't know
I was gonna pull a gun on you?

1:41:11.860 --> 1:41:14.360
I did. No, I didn't.

1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:20.280
-Is that okay?
-Yeah, it's good.

1:41:21.660 --> 1:41:22.950
One second.

1:41:27.830 --> 1:41:32.130
-I think that's gonna stay. Is that okay?
-Yeah, it's great.

1:41:32.250 --> 1:41:33.300
Okay.

1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:38.890
-All right. I'm not very good at this.
-You're very good.

1:41:52.530 --> 1:41:54.190
What's the matter?

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:56.530
Jesus.

1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:02.120
I haven't changed a thing.

1:42:03.290 --> 1:42:05.540
I gotta go. And you gotta go with me.
Come on.

1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:06.870
What?

1:42:07.370 --> 1:42:09.830
-I thought you said I was safe now.
-I was wrong. I was wrong.

1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:12.170
You gotta go with me now. Right now.

1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:15.050
Wait, wait, wait! Don't answer it.

1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:18.680
Don't answer it. I'll prove it to you.

1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:19.840
That's your friend Beth calling.

1:42:19.970 --> 1:42:21.430
Let the machine pick it up.
She's gonna say,

1:42:21.550 --> 1:42:25.100
"Hi, Claire. It's Beth. Are you there?
I'm sorry to call you so early,

1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:28.230
"but when you didn't call me last night
I got worried."

1:42:28.770 --> 1:42:31.520
<i>Claire? Hi, it's Beth- Are you there?</i>

1:42:31.650 --> 1:42:33.020
<i>I'm sorry to call you so early,</i>

1:42:33.150 --> 1:42:35.150
<i>but you said you were gonna call me</i>
<i>when you got home,</i>

1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:37.030
<i>and when you didn't,</i>
<i>I started to get worried-</i>

1:42:37.150 --> 1:42:38.780
-Beth, is this a joke?
<i>-Oh, hey, hey! No-</i>

1:42:38.900 --> 1:42:40.700
<i>Like I said, I was just worried</i>
<i>about you, that's all-</i>

1:42:40.820 --> 1:42:42.830
I can't talk right now.
Someone's here. I'll call you later.

1:42:42.950 --> 1:42:43.990
<i>Claire---</i>

1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:47.200
Believe me, the only one
you're gonna be safe with is me.

1:42:47.330 --> 1:42:49.040
-Okay.
-Let's go.

1:42:54.170 --> 1:42:55.250
I don't understand.

1:42:55.380 --> 1:42:58.970
Why not just call the police
and have them arrest him at the dock?

1:42:59.550 --> 1:43:01.840
He'll set the bomb off
right there on the spot.

1:43:01.970 --> 1:43:03.470
He can't know he's been compromised

1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:05.600
until it's too late for him
to do anything about it.

1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:08.430
He'll set the timer, walk away on foot,
get on his motorcycle

1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:11.400
and ride to the Crescent City Bridge
to watch.

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:15.150
Okay, then what?
You defuse the bomb?

1:43:15.650 --> 1:43:17.530
Then I defuse the bomb.

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:17.840
There's my truck.

1:44:27.470 --> 1:44:29.350
-All these people.
-There he is.

1:44:29.470 --> 1:44:30.770
Where?

1:44:30.890 --> 1:44:33.940
You see the military jacket
coming this way?

1:44:37.980 --> 1:44:39.780
It's just what you said.

1:44:39.900 --> 1:44:43.110
All right,
you see those officers behind you?

1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:45.320
-Yeah.
-When the ferry pulls off,

1:44:45.450 --> 1:44:47.910
I want you to tell them about the bomb,
all right?

1:44:48.030 --> 1:44:50.370
-They'll believe me?
-They better believe you.

1:44:50.490 --> 1:44:52.710
-Come on, they'll arrest me.
-They won't arrest you.

1:44:52.830 --> 1:44:56.460
They'll take you into custody.
You'll be fine. That's a good thing.

1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:58.210
Don't turn around.

1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:06.050
Doug...

1:45:09.100 --> 1:45:10.470
Be careful.

1:45:43.460 --> 1:45:45.260
<i>Your attention, please-</i>

1:45:45.380 --> 1:45:47.930
<i>Passengers are not allowed</i>
<i>on the car deck</i>

1:45:48.050 --> 1:45:50.640
<i>when the ferry is in motion-</i>

1:45:57.310 --> 1:45:58.810
Sir! Sir.

1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:01.480
Excuse me, sir, you're gonna
have to move to the upper deck.

1:46:01.610 --> 1:46:04.190
-Passengers aren't allowed here.
-Okay.

1:46:43.650 --> 1:46:45.820
Can't believe it. They're right on time.

1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:48.240
Let's get these boys to their party.

1:47:10.930 --> 1:47:12.760
Mama!

1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:57.490
Excuse me, sir? Sir!

1:48:57.620 --> 1:49:00.950
There's no passengers allowed
on the car deck during transit.

1:49:04.290 --> 1:49:06.500
No passengers allowed, sir.

1:49:20.890 --> 1:49:22.020
Let's go! Let's go!

1:50:19.780 --> 1:50:21.490
It's destiny, Oerstadt.

1:50:22.370 --> 1:50:25.540
Satan reasons like a man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1:50:28.290 --> 1:50:29.750
What did you say?

1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:33.500
I'm saying it's gonna take
a little divine intervention here, buddy.

1:50:35.510 --> 1:50:37.090
I'm coming out.

1:50:45.270 --> 1:50:46.850
What'd you say?

1:50:47.980 --> 1:50:49.900
I thought you were a patriot.

1:50:50.020 --> 1:50:51.230
Oh, I am.

1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:54.610
Patriotism requires sacrifice.

1:50:55.230 --> 1:50:58.490
-I'm willing to sacrifice.
-Yeah? Who? Her? Me?

1:50:58.610 --> 1:51:01.160
You're willing to sacrifice others,
but not yourself.

1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:05.620
The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed
with the blood of patriots and tyrants.

1:51:06.830 --> 1:51:07.910
Right.

1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:11.750
Sometimes a little human collateral
is the cost of freedom, isn't it?

1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:18.760
Who are you, Oerstadt?

1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:23.100
Who are you?

1:51:25.890 --> 1:51:27.930
It's not supposed to be this way.

1:51:55.840 --> 1:51:57.460
You all right?

1:52:00.630 --> 1:52:03.550
-I killed him.
-No, you didn't. I did.

1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:06.510
<i>It's 10:48 on Fat Tuesday, Mardi Gras-</i>

1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:09.230
<i>Now let's go back in time to 1964-</i>

1:52:09.350 --> 1:52:11.390
-We're gonna die.
-No, we're not.

1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:13.980
<i>---on 105-3 FM,</i>
<i>the heart of New Orleans-</i>

1:52:14.100 --> 1:52:15.940
Hit the gas.

1:52:16.110 --> 1:52:17.570
Hit the gas!

1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:26.870
Put your hands in the air
and step out of the vehicle now!

1:52:28.580 --> 1:52:30.960
We get out now, everybody dies.

1:52:32.460 --> 1:52:34.670
You have until the count of three!

1:52:34.790 --> 1:52:35.790
Hit it.

1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:36.960
One...

1:54:49.590 --> 1:54:53.060
But my daughter's on that ferry.
Please. Please.

1:54:54.270 --> 1:54:56.430
Oh, God, my daughter!

1:55:10.950 --> 1:55:12.410
Chrissie!

1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:14.240
Chrissie!

1:55:14.370 --> 1:55:16.750
-Oh, Chrissie! Chrissie!
-It's my mom!

1:55:16.870 --> 1:55:17.960
Mom!

1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:27.260
Ma'am? We're gonna need you
to stay right here.

1:55:27.380 --> 1:55:29.470
Someone's on the way over
to take a statement

1:55:29.590 --> 1:55:31.930
and ask you some questions, okay?

1:55:56.870 --> 1:55:59.120
-Bobby.
-Doug.

1:55:59.250 --> 1:56:00.620
-How you doing?
-All right.

1:56:00.750 --> 1:56:03.210
Got a live one over here.
Pulled her out of the drink.

1:56:03.330 --> 1:56:05.670
Somehow involved in all of this.

1:56:09.510 --> 1:56:10.590
Okay.

1:56:16.390 --> 1:56:19.180
-How you doing?
-Doug?

1:56:20.270 --> 1:56:21.690
That's right.

1:56:25.060 --> 1:56:27.020
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:56:31.860 --> 1:56:33.200
Have we met?

1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.870
Yeah. Yeah, we have.

1:56:41.750 --> 1:56:43.370
It's okay. Come on.

1:56:44.330 --> 1:56:45.540
Come on.

1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:02.430
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:04.230
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:07.230
Okay. I'll get you warmed up.

1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:18.450
What is it?

1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:21.580
What is it?

1:57:26.790 --> 1:57:27.880
Doug.

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.670
What if you had to tell someone
the most important thing in the world,

1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:36.510
but you knew they'd never believe you?

1:57:37.850 --> 1:57:39.050
I'd try.
