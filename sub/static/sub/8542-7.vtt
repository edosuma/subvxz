00:12.534 --> 00:14.492
[cell phone rings]

00:14.579 --> 00:15.624
Morning, Lisbon.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.800
Morning. You close?

00:17.887 --> 00:20.150
No. Flat tire.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.022
Alright. We'll talk
when you get here.

00:22.109 --> 00:25.199
Wait, just 'cause I'm not there
doesn't mean I can't help.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.244
Hold on a sec.
What do you got?

00:27.331 --> 00:28.550
Victim's name is
Michelle Karp...

00:28.637 --> 00:30.247
I'm putting you on speaker.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.249
'Nineteen. She left
the restaurant where she worked'

00:32.336 --> 00:34.556
'around 11:00 p.m.
Never made it home.'

00:34.643 --> 00:35.861
She was abducted and murdered.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.733
Her body was dumped
here last night.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.256
Walker found her
an hour ago.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.866
- Thanks.
- Alright.

00:40.953 --> 00:43.043
[sighs]
The body's
on state park land

00:43.130 --> 00:45.697
near a picnic area
not far from the road.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.264
How was she killed?

00:47.351 --> 00:50.311
Her throat was slit.
It looks pretty clean, precise.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.530
- Mm. Blood?
- 'Hardly a drop.'

00:52.617 --> 00:55.229
She's fully clothed,
so probably no sexual assault.

00:55.316 --> 00:58.449
'Her hands and feet
are bound with wire.'

00:58.536 --> 01:00.495
Small pebbles have been
placed on her eyes.

01:00.582 --> 01:03.759
Huh, nice touch.
Pebbles from the crime scene?

01:03.846 --> 01:05.413
It looks like it, yeah.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.764
And the...oh. And the wire?

01:08.851 --> 01:11.723
It's knotted.
Neatly, carefully.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.117
Someone took their time.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.513
Yeah, you're right.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.471
I didn't say anything.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.995
No, but you were thinking
whoever did this

01:23.083 --> 01:25.824
has killed before
many times.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.870
Yes, but I can't
assume that.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.567
Trust your instincts,
Lisbon.

01:29.654 --> 01:33.484
Boss. Just got off the phone
with Fresno P.D. The killer's

01:33.571 --> 01:36.531
'M.O. fits four other murders
they've had in 18 months.'

01:36.618 --> 01:38.359
Looks like we've got
a serial killer.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.189
'Huh? See?'

01:42.276 --> 01:44.147
You called it, Lisbon.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.628
You called it!

01:48.369 --> 01:51.241
[theme music]

02:04.211 --> 02:06.648
Fresno P.D. sent over
their files an hour ago.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.215
Here's what we got so far.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.217
The San Joaquin killer
abducts young girls.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.567
All between the ages
of 16 and 20.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.352
He takes them to a location
where he binds their hands

02:15.439 --> 02:17.920
and feet with wire, cuts
their throat and dumps them.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.923
Objects found near the crime
scene are placed over the eyes.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.968
Pebbles, glass pieces,
and bottle caps so far.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.970
Any pattern to where
the bodies were found?

02:25.057 --> 02:26.668
It seems random, but --

02:26.755 --> 02:29.410
Fresno P.D. said the girls
were taken at opportune moments.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.194
Often the only time
they were alone.

02:31.281 --> 02:32.630
Meaning he stalks them first.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.458
Does Fresno P.D.
have a suspect?

02:34.545 --> 02:37.635
Yep.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.420
- Eight suspects?
- 'Yeah.'

02:39.507 --> 02:42.510
Due to the lack of evidence, the
list hasn't been narrowed down.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.382
Grab Cho, get the list of names,
and talk to them.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.906
- Meh.
- What?

02:47.993 --> 02:49.560
You're just going
through the motions.

02:49.647 --> 02:50.909
Yeah, it's called
police work.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.824
Well, why not try
a fresh approach?

02:52.911 --> 02:54.304
Like what, tarot cards?

02:54.391 --> 02:56.698
Go directly to the one
that feels right.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.787
Look, these are all
viable suspects.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.832
The Fresno P.D. did
their job well.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.270
So you're gonna do
the same job over again?

03:03.357 --> 03:06.229
Take a close look at these guys.
Use your intuition.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.709
Which one is guilty?

03:09.363 --> 03:10.842
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.801
You've been
a cop for a while.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.369
What you don't know is what you
know without knowing.

03:15.456 --> 03:19.068
- Take a guess and run with it.
- Alright. Okay.

03:19.155 --> 03:23.812
- Okay.
- Alright. Okay.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.423
Not him.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.425
Bow tie, no.

03:32.603 --> 03:33.822
Not him.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.824
[photo rustles]

03:35.911 --> 03:37.260
Or him.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.219
[photo rustles]

03:40.394 --> 03:42.744
It could be him.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.876
Sneaky eyes.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.837
On the other hand,
he's got a college education.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.491
That profiling blather,
forget about that.

03:50.578 --> 03:51.666
Go with your gut.

03:51.753 --> 03:54.712
[sighs]

03:54.799 --> 03:57.672
There. In seconds,
you've whittled it down

03:57.759 --> 03:59.717
to a manageable
three suspects.

03:59.804 --> 04:02.024
Which one of these guys
jumps out at you?

04:03.678 --> 04:06.463
[telephone rings in distance]

04:09.161 --> 04:11.816
This one?

04:11.903 --> 04:14.471
Yeah, but it's just a hunch.
I don't know why.

04:14.558 --> 04:18.214
Best kind of hunch.
As good a place to start as any.

04:19.389 --> 04:21.086
Nicely done, Lisbon.

04:21.173 --> 04:23.437
[Van Pelt]
'His name is Richard Haibach.'

04:23.524 --> 04:25.830
'He's 44 years old,
lives alone.'

04:25.917 --> 04:29.181
He has an alibi for two murders,
but Fresno P.D. logged

04:29.269 --> 04:31.227
complaints against him
for loitering.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.621
Apparently he likes to park
outside local high schools.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.187
'Including one
a victim went to.'

04:35.275 --> 04:37.842
- That's all I got.
- Alright.

04:37.929 --> 04:41.324
You mind waiting here?
I want to talk to him on my own.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.325
Sure.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.436
Richard Haibach?

05:06.523 --> 05:07.785
Who are you?

05:07.872 --> 05:09.352
I'm agent Lisbon
with the CBI.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.659
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

05:11.746 --> 05:14.879
- Actually, I do.
- It shouldn't take long, sir.

05:14.966 --> 05:17.186
- Can I come in?
- Uh, not without a warrant.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.363
Okay. Uh, can you tell me
where you were last night?

05:20.450 --> 05:23.975
Home alone all night.
Why, was there another murder?

05:24.062 --> 05:26.630
I can't comment on
an ongoing investigation, sir.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.763
That means there was one.
I'm not dumb.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.591
I've said a hundred times
already.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.375
I've got nothing to do
with this.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.594
Sir, I didn't--

05:33.681 --> 05:35.160
You people just
won't let go.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.511
I'm getting tired being
harassed all the time.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.643
Mr. Haibach, I just
have a few questions.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.167
- Then I'll be on my way.
- I know the law.

05:42.254 --> 05:45.083
I don't have to answer your
questions or tell you anything.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.535
[cell phone keypad beeps]

06:01.622 --> 06:04.146
[rings]

06:04.233 --> 06:06.278
- Hey, boss.
- 'Anything? Updates?'

06:06.366 --> 06:09.064
Yeah, I checked out the other
two suspects on the list.

06:09.151 --> 06:11.109
'The first's been
out of state all week.'

06:11.196 --> 06:12.981
'The FAA flight list
confirms it.'

06:13.068 --> 06:15.287
'The second was with his wife,
kids, and in-laws.'

06:15.375 --> 06:17.855
- Anyone else on the list?
- 'Cho's working those.'

06:17.942 --> 06:20.336
Half alibied out straightaway.
He's starting on the other half.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.990
'Hold off. I want you'

06:22.077 --> 06:23.644
to canvas the crime scene.

06:23.731 --> 06:27.474
See if you can put Haibach
anywhere near there last night.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.650
So? Is he our guy?

06:29.737 --> 06:31.956
I didn't get
a good feeling from him.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.002
[keys jangle, ignition clicks]

06:36.134 --> 06:38.093
So we'll start with
an intro, you know.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.616
Background on
the San Joaquin killer

06:39.703 --> 06:41.879
and then I'll go into
questions for you two.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.580
Um, wait. Excuse me, gentlemen,
one moment, please.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.234
Paul, can you hold
the roll, please?

06:50.584 --> 06:54.196
Mr. Jane, how are you?

06:54.283 --> 06:56.198
- Hello, Karen.
- Okay, listen, I understand.

06:56.285 --> 06:59.288
But I have a new show now.
It's a whole new format.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.073
More intimate, none of that
"gotcha" journalism I did.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.991
Oh. What'd they do,
hold your shoes hostage?

07:07.078 --> 07:08.602
[chuckles]
Very funny.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.517
This week, I'm taking
an in-depth look

07:10.604 --> 07:13.563
at the San Joaquin killer.
I'm hoping you'll join me for

07:13.650 --> 07:16.044
the broadcast Thursday night,
offer your insight, experience.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.568
You don't need me. You have
special agent Wainright here.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.396
He's a good, honest man.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.181
Yes, but he doesn't pop
on camera the way you do.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.096
Oh, Karen, you flatter me.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.795
Good to see you. Be well.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.318
[sighs]

07:29.405 --> 07:31.146
Let's go.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.844
[clears throat]

07:33.931 --> 07:37.369
With me today is special agent
Luther Wainright of the CBI.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.241
Welcome,
and James Panzer

07:39.328 --> 07:41.330
an investigative crime
reporter and blogger.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.027
Mr. Panzer,
we'll start with you.

07:43.114 --> 07:46.117
You've been tracking the San
Joaquin killer for how long now?

07:46.204 --> 07:48.990
Well, it's been, uh, nearly
two years now, Karen.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.514
That's when he took
the life of Molly Maier

07:51.601 --> 07:54.952
a young girl who lived down the
street from me back in Fresno.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.520
Uh, that was his first victim
that we know of.

07:57.607 --> 08:00.088
And pursuing him is pretty much
your life now, right?

08:00.175 --> 08:02.699
You created a web site
devoted to his capture?

08:02.786 --> 08:05.441
Yes, that's right. Molly's
family, they're good people

08:05.528 --> 08:08.357
and they deserve justice. All
his victims deserve justice.

08:08.444 --> 08:11.142
I'm simply trying to help
achieve that goal.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.970
And s-special
Lieutenant Wainright..

08:13.057 --> 08:14.276
Special agent Wainright.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.147
Special Agent.
And special agent Wainright

08:16.234 --> 08:17.932
how close are you
to that goal?

08:18.019 --> 08:20.717
To arresting
the San Joaquin killer?

08:20.804 --> 08:23.372
Well, Karen, we are
absolutely making progress.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.942
[footsteps approaching]

08:30.074 --> 08:32.512
Working on a computer?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.644
What's next,
ray guns, teleporters?

08:34.731 --> 08:36.124
Mm.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.474
Hang on. Hey, Cho.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.041
'Haibach wasn't home
last night.'

08:40.128 --> 08:42.347
He was at a bodega near
the crime scene

08:42.434 --> 08:44.132
an hour before Michelle Karp
went missing.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.917
Owner I.D.'d him, said he was
parked in front

08:47.004 --> 08:48.745
for 20 minutes
before he went inside.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.530
How close to
the crime scene?

08:50.617 --> 08:52.836
Hey, how far
from the crime scene are we?

08:52.923 --> 08:54.316
[mouth full]
Six blocks.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.752
What?

08:55.839 --> 08:57.493
Six blocks.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.494
- Six blocks.
- 'Alright.'

08:58.581 --> 08:59.887
I'll work on Judge Waters.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.976
The proximity and the fact
that Haibach lied

09:02.063 --> 09:04.718
should be enough to get him
to sign a search warrant.

09:04.805 --> 09:05.719
'Okay.'

09:08.852 --> 09:10.288
[mouth full]
What?

09:10.375 --> 09:12.552
How do you not feel
that on your face?

09:12.639 --> 09:14.728
Feel what?

09:25.869 --> 09:27.392
[Patrick]
James Panzer?

09:27.479 --> 09:28.829
Patrick Jane.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.395
- Hello.
- Thanks for meeting with me.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.920
Oh, anything I can do to help
with the investigation.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.749
So, James,
what's your deal?

09:35.836 --> 09:38.621
You've devoted your life to
the capture of a serial killer.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.711
That's either very saintly
or very weird.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.713
Well, that's an odd notion
coming from you.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.846
And I know about you,
Mr. Jane.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.239
Ah, I thought you might.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.198
Red John did kill
my family.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.243
Uh, what is it
that gives you cause?

09:52.330 --> 09:54.202
What did Molly Maier
mean to you?

09:54.289 --> 09:56.508
I didn't know her.
I never spoke to her.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.033
I saw her at
the bus stop a few times.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.165
But, uh, it was
such a brutal act.

10:01.252 --> 10:04.255
It was so close to home that it
had a visceral impact

10:04.342 --> 10:06.823
on me that I couldn't shake.
I don't know why.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.912
I mean, people search
for reason or meaning

10:08.999 --> 10:11.393
behind events in their lives,
when more often than not

10:11.480 --> 10:13.264
there is none.

10:13.351 --> 10:16.093
Oh, uh, congratulations,
by the way.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.574
Thank you. For what?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.620
You killed Red John.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.623
Oh, that. Yes. Hmm.

Well, it's a possibility,
albeit a rather obvious one.

killer is not

10:44.556 --> 10:45.906

He doesn't kill
for the same reasons.

for the immediate pleasure

10:56.046 --> 10:57.439

- Exactly.

he murders his victims.

11:02.923 --> 11:06.753

slowly, carefully

11:06.840 --> 11:09.930

drain out of their eyes.

but I don't have the pull.
We need an arrest.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.537
I'll get him.
I need time.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.756
- Time we don't have.
- I'll get him.

24:13.843 --> 24:16.193
Okay. How long do you need?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.587
I'll have him in custody
by the morning.

24:21.068 --> 24:24.158
Give you till the morning.
Good luck.

24:26.682 --> 24:29.468
Panzer knows everything
about this case.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.253
'We've got no forensic evidence
and no eyewitnesses.'

24:32.340 --> 24:34.211
How do you propose
we catch him?

24:34.298 --> 24:36.170
We take away
what he wants most.

24:47.094 --> 24:50.010
Mr. Jane.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.882
Any news?

24:52.969 --> 24:54.710
Uh, n-not now, Karen.

24:54.797 --> 24:57.104
Please, give us
a morsel, anything.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.244
Okay. We have a suspect.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.029
We'll be making an arrest
sometime tonight.

25:09.116 --> 25:11.074
We'll announce it to the press
tomorrow morning.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.816
- Who is it?
- You'll find out tomorrow.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.906
Come on. Just tell me if it's
one of the previous suspects.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.517
[scoffs]

25:18.604 --> 25:20.431
It is, isn't it?

25:22.564 --> 25:25.480
- You didn't hear it from me.
- You can trust me.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.178
I mean it. You can't
go public with this today.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.224
I'm only telling you
so you're not caught

25:30.311 --> 25:31.399
off guard
tomorrow morning.

25:31.486 --> 25:35.490
Thank you. Wait. Patrick.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.362
The offer's still open
if you wanna come on my show.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.756
Uh, yeah, thank you,
but no, thanks.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.236
Think about it.
That's all.

25:42.323 --> 25:43.672
Sure.

25:43.759 --> 25:47.371
Dan. Dan.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.113
Call the office
and clear the 7:00 open.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.028
I've got a breaking story.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.378
Alright.
What's going on?

25:54.465 --> 25:56.467
Panzer committed these
murders out of hubris.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.253
He wants to create a mythology
around the San Joaquin killer.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.560
That's why he started
the web site.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.039
He doesn't just wanna kill.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.085
- He wants people to be in awe.
- Yes?

26:05.172 --> 26:07.130
So we arrest someone else
for the murders.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.784
Someone pathetic and unworthy.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.526
Thus destroying his mythology
with one fatal blow.

26:11.613 --> 26:14.616
Panzer will go out and kill
again just to prove us wrong.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.531
And we'll be there
waiting for him.

26:16.618 --> 26:19.229
Arrest somebody else?

26:19.316 --> 26:20.666
Oh..

26:22.015 --> 26:23.146
Are you sure, boss?

26:23.233 --> 26:25.496
I got this.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.324
Oh, come on.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.935
You people just don't quit..
Oh!

26:29.022 --> 26:30.240
You're under arrest.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.720
For what?

26:31.807 --> 26:32.808
We'll think of something.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.375
[Haibach groans]

26:34.462 --> 26:35.419
[doorbell chimes]

26:35.506 --> 26:36.943
[Panzer]
Hello?

26:37.030 --> 26:39.728
Mr. Panzer, it's Patrick.
I have some information.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.557
[buzzer buzzing]

26:44.472 --> 26:46.605
we got him.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.998
San Joaquin killer.
Made an arrest.

26:49.085 --> 26:52.262
I heard about it on the news,
but I didn't believe it.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.829
- Who is it?
- Richard Haibach.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.049
- I thought he had an alibi.
- Faked.

26:56.136 --> 26:58.355
Lied about the whole thing,
which isn't difficult to

26:58.442 --> 27:00.401
pull off if you know
what you're doing.

27:00.488 --> 27:01.881
You're certain
that it's him?

27:01.968 --> 27:03.970
We found pictures of
women in his home.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.972
Two of the victims
were amongst them.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.669
That doesn't prove
he's the killer.

27:07.756 --> 27:10.890
We found something else.
I can't comment on specifics.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.806
But the A.G.'s office
is confident that it

27:13.893 --> 27:16.417
along with Haibach's proximity
to the Karp murder

27:16.504 --> 27:19.899
and the photos will be enough
for a conviction.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.292
We'll announce it to the press
tomorrow morning.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.164
I wanted you to know first,

27:24.251 --> 27:26.732
given your...
personal attachment to the case.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.475
And I wanted to stop by
and say thanks for your help.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.913
Oh, yes, of course.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.524
Look, can I get you
a drink or something?

27:36.611 --> 27:39.832
No, thanks. Do you mind
if I use your restroom?

27:39.919 --> 27:41.616
Oh, sure, sure.
Right-right over there.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.445
- End of the hall here?
- Yes.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.585
[toilet flushes]

27:57.023 --> 27:59.634
[cabinet door creaks]

28:18.522 --> 28:20.524
[switch clicks]

28:23.266 --> 28:28.228
You sure you don't want
a drink or a snack?

28:28.315 --> 28:31.753
Oh, no. I have to get going.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.798
[sighs]

28:32.885 --> 28:34.190
[door opens]

28:34.277 --> 28:36.410
You know,
it's funny, isn't it?

28:36.497 --> 28:38.064
What's that?

28:38.151 --> 28:40.980
We were both wrong
about the San Joaquin killer.

28:41.067 --> 28:44.984
He wasn't a purist, nor was he
a man desperate for attention.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.029
He was just a sick,
sexually deranged man

28:47.116 --> 28:49.640
that likes to take pictures
of little girls.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.209
Simple-minded pervert.
Goodnight.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.605
[door closes]

29:18.539 --> 29:20.410
[whispers]
Come on.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.021
[door opens]

29:22.108 --> 29:24.414
[door closes]

29:25.720 --> 29:28.027
There he is.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.512
[alarm chirps]

29:41.780 --> 29:44.260
[engine starts]

29:45.566 --> 29:47.220
Wait.

29:53.269 --> 29:56.142
[alert chiming,
seat belts click]

30:15.596 --> 30:18.991
[Lisbon]
I'll call S.F.P.D. for backup.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.041
[whispering]
Jane!

30:59.553 --> 31:03.165
[whispering]
Um...Lisbon?

31:28.625 --> 31:30.062
Couldn't stay away,
could you?

31:30.149 --> 31:31.585
[desk clangs]

31:31.672 --> 31:34.501
Put your hands in the air.
Step back from the table.

31:34.588 --> 31:35.894
What are you doing here?

31:35.981 --> 31:38.374
I said put your hands
in the air now!

31:38.461 --> 31:40.333
Look, you don't understand.
I j--

31:43.249 --> 31:46.252
What are you doing here?

31:46.339 --> 31:47.906
Turn the camera off.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.299
Karen called me
about an hour ago.

31:50.386 --> 31:53.346
She gave me this address.
She asked me to meet her here.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.914
I've never been
here before in my life.

31:58.003 --> 32:01.267
- I said turn the camera off.
- Turn it off.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.750
- You called him?
- He's the expert.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.883
I wanted him to authenticate
that this was

32:08.970 --> 32:10.798
'the kill room used
by the killer.'

32:10.885 --> 32:12.582
How did you know
about this place?

32:12.669 --> 32:16.064
She was contacted by him,
by the San Joaquin killer.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.632
Yes. Just after
my 7:00 broadcast

32:18.719 --> 32:21.330
'during which I announced
the CBI had someone in custody.'

32:21.417 --> 32:23.245
Someone texted me
from a blocked number

32:23.332 --> 32:26.292
said he was the S.J.K.
and gave me this address.

32:26.379 --> 32:27.684
Alright. Out.

32:27.771 --> 32:30.992
This is officially
a CBI crime scene. Let's go!

32:37.477 --> 32:39.131
[breathes deeply]

32:58.237 --> 33:00.891
I tried to tell you
you had the wrong man.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.981
You set this up.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.070
You knew we were
following you.

33:05.157 --> 33:06.897
I don't know what
you're talking about

33:06.985 --> 33:09.291
but I admit,
I'm very hurt by all this.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.815
I mean, here I thought
you were seeking my help.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.295
That we were kindred spirits.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.950
Where all along
you were just lying to me.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.473
You were using me.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.999
That kind of duplicity..

33:21.086 --> 33:24.045
Leading a double life,
I don't know how you do that.

33:44.761 --> 33:46.676
'Agent Lisbon, Jane.'

33:46.763 --> 33:50.289
I'd like you to meet
FBI special agent Susan Darcy.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.595
As of this morning,
her team will be

33:52.682 --> 33:53.944
taking over the investigation.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.077
- Sir--
- No, it's okay. It's fine.

33:56.164 --> 33:58.079
The man you want
is James Panzer.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.518
What sort of evidence
do you have on Panzer?

34:02.605 --> 34:04.738
- Well, nothing--
- Nothing concrete.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.654
Not, uh, your kind
of evidence, anyhow.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.917
How about your kind
of evidence?

34:11.788 --> 34:14.008
His medicine cabinet
is too neat.

34:17.229 --> 34:19.492
That's an interesting
perspective.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.015
I'll absorb the case files

34:21.102 --> 34:23.104
and if Panzer looks like
a good unsub

34:23.191 --> 34:26.455
you can be rest assured
that we will be on him.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.589
- No, you won't.
- Jane?

34:29.676 --> 34:32.679
While she's absorbing the case
files, Panzer will kill again.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.289
You're not being
constructive right now.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.987
- I'm just being honest.
- It's okay.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.467
I understand you're upset.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.295
You have every reason
to be upset.

34:40.382 --> 34:43.429
I would be, too, if someone
was taking over my case.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.909
If he does kill again,
it will be my responsibility,

34:45.996 --> 34:47.955
And I will answer for it.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.739
But let me be very clear.

34:49.826 --> 34:53.874
This investigation is now under
the jurisdiction of the FBI.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.223
It's all yours.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.405
I need those case files
as soon as possible.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.451
Yeah.

35:07.888 --> 35:08.845
Jane.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.457
Jane, you heard Wainright.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.676
Our hands are tied.

35:13.763 --> 35:15.113
Yeah.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.030
Yeah. Maybe yours are.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.212
[jazz music]

35:29.518 --> 35:32.782
Well, Karen, no disrespect
to the CBI or the FBI

35:32.869 --> 35:35.568
but it's not a good sign
when a case as complex

35:35.655 --> 35:36.960
and important as this one

35:37.047 --> 35:39.572
is shuttled
from agency to agency.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.836
There's, there's a lack of
communication and consistency.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.926
There's a pointless
replication of effort.

35:46.013 --> 35:49.234
You see the same problems in the
search for the zodiac killer.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.670
Uh, hold that thought, James.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.063
We'll be right back
after a quick break

35:53.151 --> 35:56.763
with our guest, James Panzer,
and a surprise special guest

35:56.850 --> 35:59.722
CBI consultant
Patrick Jane.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.071
And clear.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.812
I hope you don't mind.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.292
But--

36:04.379 --> 36:05.511
Patrick.

36:05.598 --> 36:08.427
Thank you so much
for coming, really.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.170
Hi.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.693
We're getting Mr. Jane
mic-ed?

36:13.780 --> 36:14.911
Yes, we are.

36:17.914 --> 36:21.614
[male #1]
In five, four, three, two...

36:21.701 --> 36:23.355
[jazz music]

36:23.442 --> 36:27.359
Joining us now on this S.J.K.
special edition is Patrick Jane

36:27.446 --> 36:29.491
'a consultant with the CBI'

36:29.578 --> 36:32.929
who has his own amazing story
of terrible tragedy

36:33.016 --> 36:35.454
and cold revenge. Patrick,
thank you for joining us.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.412
Oh, it's my pleasure, Karen.
James.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.849
In a nutshell,
why has the San Joaquin killer

36:39.936 --> 36:41.851
proven so difficult
to apprehend?

36:41.938 --> 36:43.331
Well, James is exactly right.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.377
There are too many cooks
in the kitchen.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.335
But I-I would also like to add

36:47.422 --> 36:49.642
that the San Joaquin killer
is very likely someone

36:49.729 --> 36:52.340
that has attached themselves
to the investigation somehow.

36:52.427 --> 36:55.561
Someone, uh, hiding
in plain sight.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.476
That's interesting.
Is there anyone

36:57.563 --> 36:59.042
in particular
that you're thinking of?

36:59.129 --> 37:00.087
We have our suspicions.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.089
Well, that sounds promising.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.439
Can we expect an arrest
anytime soon?

37:04.526 --> 37:05.745
Very likely.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.443
Karen, if I may ask Jane
a question, I'd--

37:08.530 --> 37:10.228
- Could you hold that thought?
- Well, I--

37:10.315 --> 37:12.186
Can-can you elaborate
on that, Patrick?

37:12.273 --> 37:14.449
What makes you think that
the San Joaquin killer

37:14.536 --> 37:15.929
will be caught soon?

37:16.016 --> 37:18.540
Well, he's become wrapped up
in his own mythology.

37:18.627 --> 37:21.848
Uh, he's drank his own
Kool-Aid, so to speak.

37:21.935 --> 37:25.286
Well, there is absolutely
nothing to suggest that.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.245
You're right, James,
I have no evidence.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.247
Just a good sense
of the man.

37:29.334 --> 37:32.032
The San Joaquin killer
is a sad little person

37:32.119 --> 37:34.991
living in a fantasy world
of power and prestige.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.517
It's only a matter of time
before he makes a mistake.

37:38.604 --> 37:40.736
Jim?

37:40.823 --> 37:43.478
I'd like to say I believe
what Mr. Jane is saying

37:43.565 --> 37:45.611
but I can't disagree more.

37:45.698 --> 37:49.441
I mean, this man is smart,
he is rational

37:49.528 --> 37:50.833
he's brilliant, in fact.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.967
Hmm. I-I respect your skills
as a journalist

37:54.054 --> 37:57.057
and as a blogger, James,
but I do this for a living.

37:57.144 --> 38:00.016
I don't think you know
or understand this man at all.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.715
Well, that's absurd!
I mean, that's just...

38:02.802 --> 38:07.459
That's... your opinion,
and I respect that.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.808
But, Patrick, I mean,

38:08.895 --> 38:10.853
I think you should
consider the plain facts.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.551
James, hold that thought.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.292
If I could just
respond here.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.816
You'll have that chance
when we come back with more

38:16.903 --> 38:19.645
on the search for
the San Joaquin killer.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.864
[male #1]
'We're clear.
30 seconds, everyone.'

38:21.951 --> 38:23.475
Great stuff, guys.

38:37.924 --> 38:41.667
I know what you're doing.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.059
You think I'm stupid?

38:43.146 --> 38:45.584
Yes.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.021
You're not going to
ruin this for me.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.852
When we come back,
Jim, you're up.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.636
[male #1]
'Ten seconds.'

38:56.116 --> 38:58.814
'In five, four'

38:58.901 --> 39:01.077
'three, two..'

39:01.164 --> 39:03.210
James Panzer may be
the man who knows

39:03.297 --> 39:05.081
the San Joaquin killer best.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.997
Tell us, Jim,
will he kill again?

39:08.084 --> 39:10.348
Well, Karen,
I hate to say this

39:10.435 --> 39:13.176
but, yes, I-I think this man
will strike again

39:13.263 --> 39:16.963
and I think that there will be
many, many more victims.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.530
A dark prediction.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.575
Uh, what makes you
think that?

39:20.662 --> 39:24.797
Well, he is growing more bold
and more confident every day.

39:24.884 --> 39:27.234
More sure of his abilities
and his greatness.

39:27.321 --> 39:28.670
'And why shouldn't he be?'

39:28.757 --> 39:31.456
'He's been able to evade
detection so easily.'

39:31.543 --> 39:33.936
He is too good to be caught.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.331
Patrick, thoughts?

39:43.468 --> 39:45.600
Patrick?

39:45.687 --> 39:49.169
It's funny. Red John thought
exactly the same thing.

39:49.256 --> 39:52.694
[scoffs]
Somehow, I don't think
the San Joaquin killer

39:52.781 --> 39:55.393
will be quite as easy
to kill as Red John.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.003
You're very much mistaken.

39:57.090 --> 40:00.354
Red John was an accomplished
killer, no doubt.

40:00.441 --> 40:03.357
And I applaud you
for ridding us of him.

40:03.444 --> 40:06.578
But there is no comparison
to the San Joaquin killer.

40:06.665 --> 40:09.537
'Red John was
a common sociopath.'

40:09.624 --> 40:12.061
Lazy, sloppy, delusional.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.107
You really have no idea
what you're saying.

40:14.194 --> 40:17.763
- Red John--
- Red John is dead.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.634
And the fact
that he allowed himself

40:19.721 --> 40:22.637
to be caught and killed by you
just proves my point.

40:24.639 --> 40:28.643
Compared to S.J.K.,
Red John was nothing.

40:28.730 --> 40:31.603
An amateur, already forgotten.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.524
[knock on door]

40:41.917 --> 40:43.092
You, uh..

40:45.660 --> 40:48.576
...you were very good
out there.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.796
Well...thank you.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.764
I wasgood.

41:05.593 --> 41:08.466
[cell phone vibrating]

41:13.949 --> 41:15.211
Hello?

41:18.432 --> 41:19.389
Where?

41:32.707 --> 41:35.623
[dramatic music]

41:35.710 --> 41:38.583
[police radio chatter]

41:44.110 --> 41:46.025
What's happened?

41:46.112 --> 41:48.680
Panzer. See for yourself.

42:24.411 --> 42:27.327
[theme music]
