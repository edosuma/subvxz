00:08.200 --> 00:09.132
Lawyer: WELL, I HAVE TO GO WITH

00:09.140 --> 00:10.459
SEAN, CHRISTIAN. YOU'RE TURNING

00:10.470 --> 00:11.505
OUT TO BE THE FATHER OF HIS

00:11.510 --> 00:13.239
TEENAGE SON WOULD TRIGGER THE

00:13.240 --> 00:14.275
FORCE MAJEURE CLAUSE OF YOUR

00:14.280 --> 00:15.474
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. IT'S

00:15.480 --> 00:16.708
CERTAINLY A CATACLYSMIC AND

00:16.710 --> 00:18.405
UNFORESEEN EVENT.

00:18.410 --> 00:19.741
Christian: IT WAS 17 YEARS AGO,

00:19.750 --> 00:20.614
BEFORE WE EVEN SIGNED THAT

00:20.620 --> 00:21.746
CONTRACT. THERE MUST BE SOME

00:21.750 --> 00:23.286
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.211
Sean: THERE'S NO STATUTE OF

00:24.220 --> 00:25.187
LIMITATIONS ON BEING A

00:25.190 --> 00:26.680
BACKSTABBING ASSHOLE. AFTER

00:26.690 --> 00:27.679
WHAT YOU DID, HOW COULD I EVER

00:27.690 --> 00:29.089
TRUST YOU AGAIN?

00:29.090 --> 00:29.784
Christian: WITH A LOT OF HARD

00:29.790 --> 00:32.429
WORK ON BOTH OF OUR PARTS. YES,

00:32.430 --> 00:34.455
I SCREWED UP, SO DID JULIA, BUT

00:34.460 --> 00:37.827
WE WERE 23. WE WERE JUST KIDS.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.161
YOU'RE MY BROTHER, SEAN.

00:39.170 --> 00:40.159
Sean: BROTHERS DON'T SLEEP WITH

00:40.170 --> 00:45.233
EACH OTHER'S WIVES.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.878
Christian: DR. BAHAR IS THE BEST

00:46.880 --> 00:49.178
COUPLES THERAPIST IN MIAMI. HE

00:49.180 --> 00:51.148
SPECIALIZES IN BUSINESS

00:51.150 --> 00:52.515
PARTNERSHIPS ON THE ROCKS.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.646
Sean: OUR BUSINESS ISN'T ON THE

00:53.650 --> 00:54.878
ROCKS, CHRISTIAN. IT'S SMASHED

00:54.880 --> 01:01.285
TO HELL, MAST TO RUDDER.

01:01.290 --> 01:01.881
Christian: WHAT ABOUT A

01:01.890 --> 01:04.324
COOLING-OFF PERIOD, THEN? BEFORE

01:04.330 --> 01:05.285
WE ALL DO SOMETHING RASH

01:05.290 --> 01:05.858
AND STUPID.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.418
Sean: I DON'T WANT TO COOL OFF.

01:07.430 --> 01:09.159
I WANT YOU TO BOX UP YOUR OFFICE

01:09.170 --> 01:15.461
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF MY LIFE.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.563
Christian: FINE. BUT IT WON'T BE

01:17.570 --> 01:19.606
A MOLE REMOVAL. YOU WANT OUT,

01:19.610 --> 01:21.874
IT'S GONNA GET INVASIVE. I GET

01:21.880 --> 01:23.142
CUSTODY OF THE FURNITURE I

01:23.150 --> 01:24.799
PICKED OUT FOR THE WAITING ROOM,

01:24.810 --> 01:27.347
THE ANESTHESIA MACHINE, LIZ--

01:27.350 --> 01:28.339
Sean: THAT MACHINE IS WORTH OVER

01:28.350 --> 01:29.817
$90,000. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT AND

01:29.820 --> 01:30.741
LIZ.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.911
Lawyer: MAY I SPEAK FRANKLY?

01:32.920 --> 01:34.478
RIGHT NOW YOU EACH NET OVER

01:34.490 --> 01:37.755
$1.4 MILLION A YEAR. SPLIT UP,

01:37.760 --> 01:38.886
YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO EARN HALF

01:38.890 --> 01:43.725
THAT COMBINED. BUSINESS BREAKUPS

01:43.730 --> 01:45.664
ARE OFI'ENTIMES MORE DEVASTATING

01:45.670 --> 01:47.888
AND UGLY THAN A MARITAL SPLIT.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.606
LOYAL AND GRAPEVINE CLIENTS ARE

01:49.610 --> 01:51.237
LIKELY TO GET CONFUSED. WHICH

01:51.240 --> 01:52.730
DOCTOR IS THE BETTER ONE?

01:52.740 --> 01:53.809
PATIENTS UP END GOING SOMEWHERE

01:53.810 --> 01:54.936
ELSE FOR FEAR OF CHOOSING THE

01:54.940 --> 01:58.501
WRONG DOCTOR. APART, YOU GUYS

01:58.510 --> 01:59.579
ARE NOWHERE AS NEAR AS STRONG AS

01:59.580 --> 02:01.275
YOU ARE TOGETHER, NOT AT THIS

02:01.280 --> 02:02.178
PHASE OF YOUR LIVES.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.248
Sean: THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M

02:03.250 --> 02:03.944
WORRIED ABOUT.

02:03.950 --> 02:05.212
Christian: YOU SHOULD BE. YOU

02:05.220 --> 02:06.255
THINK PATIENTS ARE GONNA WANT TO

02:06.260 --> 02:07.659
TRAVEL FROM ALL OVER THE STATE

02:07.660 --> 02:09.321
TO VISIT YOU IN YOUR OFFICE WITH

02:09.330 --> 02:10.683
YOUR BIRDS-OF-PARADISE AND FAUX

02:10.690 --> 02:11.759
MARBLE TILES?

02:11.760 --> 02:12.692
Sean: I THINK IT'S GONNA BE

02:12.700 --> 02:13.519
EASIER FOR ME TO FIND A

02:13.530 --> 02:14.599
DECORATOR THAN IT WILL BE FOR

02:14.600 --> 02:15.658
YOU TO FIND A DOCTOR WHO WILL

02:15.660 --> 02:17.264
CARRY YOUR DEAD WEIGHT.

02:17.270 --> 02:17.929
Lawyer: ALL RIGHT, THEN. IF

02:17.930 --> 02:19.238
YOU'RE IRRECONCILABLE, I'D

02:19.240 --> 02:20.434
SUGGEST YOU BOTH LIST THE

02:20.440 --> 02:22.305
COMPANY'S ASSETS INDEPENDENTLY,

02:22.310 --> 02:23.459
AND THEN WE'LL DIVIDE THINGS UP

02:23.470 --> 02:24.505
AS AMICABLY AS POSSIBLE.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.363
Christian: WHAT ABOUT THE

02:25.370 --> 02:26.473
SURGERIES ALREADY ON THE BOOKS?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.435
Sean: I'VE CANCELED EVERYTHING

02:27.440 --> 02:29.544
PAST THIS AFTERNOON. EXCEPT THE

02:29.550 --> 02:30.869
ROSENBERG CASE NEXT WEEK.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.416

02:33.950 --> 02:35.542

02:35.550 --> 02:36.744
CHRISTIAN. THE GOOD PUBLICITY

02:36.750 --> 02:37.682

02:37.690 --> 02:39.317

02:40.520 --> 02:41.452
GONNA NEED ALL THE HELP YOU CAN

02:41.460 --> 02:42.427
GET.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.727
Christian: I'M NOT GOING.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.379
Sean: THIS OPERATION REQUIRES 2

02:45.390 --> 02:46.857
PLASTIC SURGEONS. LIVES ARE AT

02:46.860 --> 02:50.626
STAKE. OR DO YOU WANT TO DESTROY

02:50.630 --> 02:52.632

FEEL I'M OWED THAT.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.709

YOUR CHARACTER TO CHOOSE AN

04:42.880 --> 04:43.972
IMMORAL TRAITOR.

04:43.980 --> 04:44.901
Christian: NOT SO FAST, SEAN.

04:44.910 --> 04:45.979
JUST BECAUSE LIZ AND I DIP INTO

04:45.980 --> 04:47.015
VICIOUSNESS EVERY NOW AND THEN

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR?

06:39.630 --> 06:44.863

Matt: LOOK, I'M UPSET WITH HER,

07:03.090 --> 07:04.739
OK? HOW ARE YOU DOING?"

07:04.750 --> 07:06.183

08:19.830 --> 08:20.694
UNIVERSITY MADE THE

08:20.700 --> 08:21.826
ARRANGEMENTS. I CALLED ABOUT

08:21.830 --> 08:23.024
OTHER FLIGHTS. NONE OF THEM

08:23.030 --> 08:23.962
WOULD'VE GOTTEN US THERE ON

08:23.970 --> 08:25.926
TIME. WE'RE ALREADY LATE AS IT
