00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
THIS IS ONE OF THEIR STORIES.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
REALLY WAS MY FAULT.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
JUST FINISHED UP WITH THE
CLERK.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
FAULT, GRANDDAD.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
TILL THE WAR IS WON

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
TILL THE WAR IS WON

00:20.000 --> 00:20.000
IF WE DIE, I AIN'T NEVER GONNA

DAMN, THAT IS SEXY.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
>> Riley: FIRST THING YOU NEED

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
UPSET THAT I SOLD "STAR WARS" TO
DISNEY?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
UM, ONLY THE HOTTEST
UP-AND-COMING R&B STAR!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
TO DO IS GET SOME CLOTHES ON.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
NOT TO SHOW IT, OUR MONEY
PROBLEMS HAD CLEARLY MADE

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
HERE IS WHERE ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN, WAR

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
SITTING ON THE COUCH WATCHING TV.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
GRANDDAD A LITTLE CRAZY.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
SEGREGATION WAS IN THE DEEP
SOUTH.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
APPROXIMATELY 200 MILLION.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIS SONGS --
"TITTY TELETHON"?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
HERO AND CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND, DECIDED TO SPEND HIS FINAL

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
WHAT WAS ONCE A PRODUCTIVE SENIOR CITIZEN WAS NOW REDUCED

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Granddad: SEGREGATION WAS SO
BAD BACK THEN, MY RULE WAS IF IT

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
HEY, TV EXECUTIVES!

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Granddad: HUEY, RILEY, IS
THAT ELECTRICITY I HEAR?!

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
AND HOW MANY OF  THOSE  FANS
DONATED $4  BILLION  TO CHARITY?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
"PLEASURE ME ORALLY"?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
"DON'T TOUCH MY ANUS, GIRL"?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
DAYS.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
ALL RIGHT, THINK.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
WELL, IF YOU GOT TO BE BROKE, AT

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
HOW WOULD I HAVE HEARD THIS?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
BUT THINGS DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT AS PLANNED.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
WAS IN THE SOUTH, IT WASN'T
WORTH IT.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD,
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
GONNA DO.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
READY FOR ANOTHER KARDASHIAN
SHOW?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
NONE OF THEM, GEORGE.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
HUEY, WHAT DO WE DO?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
AND MOST OF MY FAMILY WAS IN THE
SOUTH, AND I DIDN'T CARE.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
THIS HOUSE IS AN AIRPLANE.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
GOOD!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
LEAST THERE'S TV TO MAKE IT
BETTER.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
WHEN'S THE NEXT SHOWING OF
STEVEN'S MOVIE?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
ALL DAY LONG ON THE RADIO,
THAT'S ALL I HEAR, EVEN ON THE

Granddad: BOYS!

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
TURN OFF ALL YOUR ELECTRONIC
DEVICES AND KEEP THEM OFF.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
'CAUSE THE NEW KARDASHIAN HAS
NEW IDEAS!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Huey: WE'RE RIGHT HERE,
GRANDDAD.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
THEY WERE NOT WORTH IT.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
WHAT'S ON, RILEY?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
THE NEXT SHOWING OF

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
WHITE STATIONS.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
>> Granddad: WHAT HOME?

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
SO, IT'S WITH THAT BACKDROP
THAT A HANDFUL OF US DECIDED TO

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Riley: MAN, ALL THESE
CHANNELS, AND THERE AIN'T

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Granddad: IMPORTANT FAMILY
ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
MATTER OF FACT, GET OUT HERE!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Granddad: HOT DAMN.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
MR. SPIELBERG'S MOVIE IS 7:30.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
WE HAVE NO HOME.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
HER.

00:53.000 --> 00:53.000
NOTHING ON.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
WAIT...THERE'S
"THE RICKEY SMILEY SHOW."

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE ARE LEAVING WOODCREST
FOREVER.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE HAVE NO FUTURE.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
YOU SHOULD BE DONE TRYING ON
THOSE CLOTHES.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TICKETS?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE
DISASTER SINCE WE MOVED HERE.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
WE HAVE NOTHING!

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
VENTURE INTO THE DEEP SOUTH TO
DEFY THOSE IMMORAL LAWS.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Granddad: NOPE.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
SURE, AND, UH, DO YOU SPEAK
BOCCE?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
MR. STINKMEANER, DO YOU

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
EH, IT'S NOT MY THING, BUT
IT'S WHAT PASSES FOR R&B NOW,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
YEP. I LOVE KARDASHIA.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Riley: I CAN'T WEAR THIS.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
LET'S EXTRAPOLATE THAT THERE...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
BOCCE IS A FICTIONAL LANGUAGE

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'VE JUST TOLD
YOU?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
ALL RIGHT?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Riley: TRUE THAT. TRUE THAT.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Granddad: WHY NOT?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
NOT TOO MUCH OF A MAN TO ADMIT
IT.

00:59.000 --> 00:59.000
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Huey: NOW, THAT'S TRUE,
GRANDDAD.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
DON'T TELL ANYONE IT'S FROM THE
THRIFT STORE.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN IS A
VERY ODD RECURRING CHARACTER IN

00:59.000 --> 00:59.000
RED...

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
IN THE "STAR WARS" UNIVERSE.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I'M A CLONE!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I GOT TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Granddad: WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE SAFE, BORING LIVES.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
SHE HAS EVERYTHING I NEED IN A
WOMAN.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.000
BITCH!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Granddad: WHAT'S THAT?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
THEY'RE INTO BLACK GUYS, SO THIS
IS WHAT I GOT TO HEAR.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Riley: "BASKETBALL WIVES."

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
IT DOES NOT EXIST, THEREFORE I CANNOT SPEAK IT.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
YES, CREATED AT THIS SECRET
AND HIGHLY ILLEGAL UNDERGROUND

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
LOOKS STYLISH TO ME.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
EVEN THOUGH AIN'T NONE OF THEM
REALLY WIVES EXCEPT MALAYSIA.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD
DAYS WHEN BLACK SINGERS WOULD

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I WAS SUPPOSED TO FIND SOME HOT,
FINANCIALLY DESPERATE OR

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
TELL HIM, HUEY.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
MM-MMM-MMM!

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
SIRI, WHO SHOT FIRST -- HAN
OR GREEDO?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Huey: IT'S NOT STYLISH.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
HE IS A SELF-DESCRIBED
CIVIL RIGHTS LEGEND, WHICH I

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
YUH-HUH.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
HUMAN CLONING FACILITY.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Granddad: IF KRIS KROSS CAN
JUMP IN THEM, YOU CAN WALK TO

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
SHOULD JUST CALL IT
"BASKETBALL JUMPOFFS."

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
DRESS IN HIGH-HEEL BOOTS OR BURN
HOOKERS WITH CRACK PIPES?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED MAMA AND
SETTLE DOWN.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
IT'S STILL EDGY, NOT ONLY 'CAUSE
HE'S BLACK, BUT INSTEAD OF LONG

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY, GEORGE.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
WHY AM I SO OLD?!

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
FEEL IS, WELL, NOT AT ALL
ACCURATE.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Granddad: OOOOH.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
EH, WHAT?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
BUT NOTHING WORKED OUT AS
PLANNED.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
SCHOOL IN THEM.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
OH, MAN, LOOK AT THEM GO!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
IF YOU CLONED ME WHEN YOU SAY
YOU DID, SHOULDN'T I STILL BE A

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
YOU'RE SHOWING YOUR AGE, MY
FRIEND.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Riley: FOR REAL, GRANDDAD?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
MONEY, HE'S GOT LONG BALLS.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
THE NEW iPHONE.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
FLIZZY'S IN TOWN, DOING A SHOW
AT WOODCREST POST PAVILION

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
IT'S JUST BEEN ONE RIDICULOUS,
STUPID, BIZARRE EPISODE AFTER

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
EVEN BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT, HIS
PARTICIPATION IN THE

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
ALL THAT BUTT AND WEAVE AND
SWEAT.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
SEE, THIS IS WHY NIGGERS DROP
OUT OF SCHOOL.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I'M TALKIN' LIKE BACK OF MY
KNEECAPS!

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
IT'S WAITING FOR  YOU!

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
ANOTHER, AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT
FOR MOVIN' US HERE.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
FREEDOM RIDES SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
COMPLETELY AGAINST HIS WILL.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
HOW COME I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS
BEFORE?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
LITTLE KID?!

01:13.000 --> 01:13.000
TONIGHT.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I WAS HOPING TO GO.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I'MA GET TEASED.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
NOW I HAVE AN EXCUSE.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Granddad: GIRL, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU DO TO ME?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Huey: IS THIS HOW YOU'RE
GONNA GO OUT, GRANDDAD?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
THE MAN WHO YOU ARE A CLONE
OF IS COLONEL H. STINKMEANER.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I'M TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD, COME ON.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
UH-OH.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
>> Granddad: NOPE. THIS IS IT.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, YOU'RE JUST
BEATING HIM TO TAKE OUT YOUR OWN

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
HE ANSWERED OUR VOLUNTEER
RECRUITMENT AD ON

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Riley: WELL, I SAY IT'S ABOUT
TIME!

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I TRICK ON YOU?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
EATING JUNK FOOD AND WATCHING
JUNK TV?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
END OF THE ROAD FOR ME.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
FRUSTRATIONS.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
YEP.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Granddad: EXCUSE ME, I WANT
TO BUY THE THING THAT I SAW ON

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I BEEN SAYIN' THIS PLACE SUCKS
SINCE WE SHOWED UP.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Riley: PRETTY MUCH.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
BlackPeopleMeet.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD, WE DON'T HAVE

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Granddad: THAT'S WHAT KIDS
ARE FOR! MOVE!

01:20.000 --> 01:33.000
Granddad: ONE TICKET FOR
CHICAGO, THANK YOU KINDLY.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I MEAN, WASN'T LIKE HE WAS GONNA
BE IN THE NBA.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Granddad: WELL, I HAVE
LEARNED MY LESSON.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
TIME FOR THIS.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
THE TV WITH THE GEORGE LUCAS --
THE GIRL IN THE PHONE.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
A FEW DAYS LATER, HE DIED IN A
STREET FIGHT.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
BUILDER REFUSED

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
THEY'RE COMING.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Huey: WE WERE CAUGHT IN A
CYCLE OF DESPAIR, VIOLENCE, AND

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
>> Granddad: YOU GUYS GO.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
SO IF HE HAPPY LOOKIN' AT HOES
HE CAN'T BAG, LEAVE HIM BE.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
INSPIRATION THAT MADE LADY SING

01:24.000 --> 01:24.000
WE'RE LEAVING.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Huey: WAIT A MINUTE,
GRANDDAD.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I'M NOT COMING.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Granddad: NOT REALLY.

YOU'RE STILL FAST.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000

THE PAPER SAID THEY WERE
EXPECTED TO ARRIVE IN ALABAMA

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
THERE WERE SOME ENHANCEMENTS.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Riley: AW, NO, GRANDDAD.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
OOH! JUST LIKE YOU SAID --

DO IT.

01:54.000 --> 02:06.000
"I'M SO GLAD I WON'T BE HERE

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GONNA DO

HOW BAD IS IT?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
IF YOU'RE SO SMART, TELL ME

THE FIRST TIME AND THINKING,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
AS "THE FUNDRAISER."

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
HE'S NOT PRESSING ANY CHARGES.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sarah: NO, I DON'T!

SERIOUSLY?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000

WAY TO USE US TO MAKE MONEY.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000

HE ATTACKED  ME!

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Sarah: YOU DID IT AGAIN!

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Riley: BORING.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
MR. FREEMAN.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
OH, NO. UNH-UNH. UNH-UNH.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
FINE.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
NIGGA JUST MAD HE DIDN'T GET
TOYS!

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
BRINGS THE 19th CENTURY TO
LIFE.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
IN ALL OF THEM, YOU ATTACK  HIM
FIRST.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Sarah: OH, I SWEAR TO GOD,
TOM, IF YOU APOLOGIZE AGAIN, YOU

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
UNH-UNH.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
MR. FREEMAN, THESE ARE
STANDARD JOB-PLACEMENT

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
"INVISIBLE MAN," A BOOK I HAD
MEANT TO READ MANY TIMES.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Granddad: BUT I HAD TO!

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
RARE SKIN CONDITION CALLED
REVITILIGO.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
AIN'T NO SINGING, NO DANCING, NO

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
ARE OUT OF HERE!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
QUESTIONS.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Huey: YOU'RE FORCING BLACK
PEOPLE TO RE-ENACT THE MOST

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
HE'S A PSYCHOPATH!

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
RICHARD PRYOR -- NOTHING.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
THEY'RE ON EVERYONE'S
APPLICATION.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I'M SORRY ABOUT MY LANGUAGE.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I  KILLED  HIM, AND...

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Tom: I'M --
MM.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I JUST...I GET SO UPSET AT THE
INJUSTICE OF SEGREGATION.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
PAINFUL PERIOD IN OUR HISTORY?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
LIBERALS ARE, OF COURSE,
RIDICULING THIS MAN'S DISEASE,

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
OH, BY THE WAY, THAT LAZY

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
BUT WITH COTTON CANDY AND A
MERRY-GO-ROUND!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
GO ON.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
OKAY.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
MEXICAN SUMBITCH CHICO CANCELED,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
LET ME BE FRANK -- YOU ARE
UNHIRABLE.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
ROBERT. WAKE UP, ROBERT.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Granddad: I MEAN, NOT  HIM,
BUT IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
WHICH, I CAN ASSURE YOU, IS
COMPLETELY REAL -- UNLIKE RAPE.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Sarah: THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
TOM!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
AND I NEED YOU TO STAY TILL

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
IT'S OKAY.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
WHY WE GOT TO CLEAN, ANYWAY?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
AND COME ON, HUEY, NOT JUST
BLACK PEOPLE.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
CLOSING TIME.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
YOU COME ACROSS AS UNEDUCATED,
YOU'VE JUST PROVEN YOU'RE

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
THAT MAN IS GOING TO ATTACK ME
AGAIN!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT
TO DO!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
>> Granddad: BUT I HAD PLANS

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Granddad: WELL, SEE, I HAD TO
GO INTO THE BATHROOM TO TAKE A

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Huey:  YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Granddad: BECAUSE WE MAY BE
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I'M PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH TO FORCE
ALL RACES TO RE-ENACT YOUR

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
I DON'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU OR
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT, OH,

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
TONIGHT.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
COMFORTABLE CURSING IN A
PROFESSIONAL SETTING, AND --

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
DU-- UH, STAND AGAINST
SEGREGATION.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
GOOD MORNING, SIRI.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
UNCLE RUCKUS RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND BASICALLY ALMOST WON.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
>> Ruckus: PLANS? PLANS?

04:40.000 --> 04:40.000
DO IT!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
AIN'T NO NIGGA MAKE NO PLANS!

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
THAT MUST BE KARDASHIA.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
PAINFUL HISTORY IF THEY OWE ME
MONEY.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
GOOD MORNING, ROBERT.

04:41.000 --> 04:41.000
Tom: WHAT?!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
BUT WHY NOT JUST TELL ME?!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
WAIT!

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
AND THEY SAID, "NIGGA, DON'T YOU
DARE GO INTO THAT BATHROOM."

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
YOU HAVE A BUSY DAY TODAY.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A NIGGA MOMENT
IS?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
HIS STANDOUT MOMENT WAS DURING

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
NIGGAS JUST REACT TO OUTSIDE

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I THINK I HAVE THE PERFECT JOB.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
EVEN JEWS!

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Granddad: WHAT ARE WE DOING?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Sarah: BECAUSE!

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
STIMULI.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
OF COURSE.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NO WOMAN WAKES UP AND SAYS,
"GEE, I HOPE MY MAN DOES

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEBATE.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NOW, I GOT SOME PLANS, TOO.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
AND I SAID, "YOU DON'T SCARE ME,
WHITE MAN.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
IT MAY BE TIME TO GIVE HER A
KEY.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU THE MAN I  KNOW  YOU CAN BE.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THANK GOD FOR THEM, OR I
WOULDN'T HAVE A JOB.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
YOWZA! YOWZA!

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
EVERYTHING I TELL HIM TO TODAY."

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
UNCLE RUCKUS, GIVE US YOUR
STRONGEST CRITIQUE OF

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I PLAN TO KEEP YOUR BLACK ASS

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
AND MY NAME AIN'T 'NIGGA.'
YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
COME ONE, COME ALL!

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
BUT AN N-WORD MOMENT, AS YOU PUT
IT, DOES NOT EXCUSE YOU FROM

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
HERE.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Granddad: IS THAT A FULL-SIZE

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
WELCOME TO FREEDOMLAND!

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
YOU'RE THE MAN, TOM!

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
SOMETIMES I WANT YOU TO
DOMINATE!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
>> Granddad: SUMBITCH!

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
'MR. FREEMAN.'"
AMAZING.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
ONE MINUTE.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
COME ON, HOMIE! BENCH!

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
OH, MAMMY!

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
YOU HAVE TO START EATING BETTER

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
OBEYING THE LAW.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Ruckus: I DON'T NEED A
MINUTE.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
SHAMPOO BOTTLE, NIGGA?!

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
SO IF THIS  IS  AN N-WORD MOMENT,
MR. FREEMAN, MY ADVICE IS, DO

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
TAKE CONTROL!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
HE'S A BLACK SUMBITCH FROM THE
SWEATY JUNGLES OF KENYA.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
>> Riley: YOU HEARD THAT MAN,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
GET OVER HERE, AL-QAEDA!

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
"DANCING WITH THE STARS"?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
AND TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
IF I'M OUT OF LINE, PUT ME IN
CHECK!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
GRANDDAD.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
WE DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO BE

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
STURDY, DID YOU HEAR THIS?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Granddad: I KNOW!

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
NOT BE AN N-WORD.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Tom: SURE, HONEY.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
FEEDING THESE BITCHES.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
NOW THAT I HAVE YOU TO REMIND
ME, IT'LL BE NO PROBLEM!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
>> Granddad: EVERYTHING'S FINE.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
YES, I DID.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Granddad: HEY!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
HE'S GOT MY VOTE.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
WHAT THE HELL?!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Granddad: WHAT KIND OF JOB IS
THIS?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
OH, GLUTEN-FREE FISH STICKS!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Sarah: OHH! TOM!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Huey: EVENTUALLY, GRANDDAD'S
PRIDE GOT THE BEST OF HIM.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
YOUR COURAGE IS AN INSPIRATION,
BROTHER.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Tom: FINE!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
IT'S JUST ONE DINNER.

04:59.000 --> 04:59.000
WE'RE DRESSED LIKE SLAVES!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Huey: WE  ARE  SLAVES,
GRANDDAD.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
NOW, LEADING THIS PARTICULAR
BUS WAS THE

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I HEAR YOU!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
>> Riley: HUEY!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Riley: THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT!

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I CAN GET HEALTHY VERSIONS OF
ALL THE CRAP I EAT!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Granddad: OH, HI, GUYS.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
FROM NOW ON, I'LL TAKE CONTROL,
AND I WON'T APOLOGIZE ANYMORE.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Huey:  ONCE NATIONAL NEWS, NOW PUBLIC ACCESS, RUCKUS CONTINUES

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
GRANDDAD'S TAKING BITCHES OUT TO

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
REVEREND STURDY HARRIS, WHO WAS
AN UP-AND-COMING FORCE ON THE

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
MY FEET HURT!

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
EAT AGAIN!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
ONE OF Y'ALL TAKE ME HOME RIGHT
NOW!

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
WHOA, I CAN'T AFFORD THIS!

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I, UH, GOT INTO A LITTLE
FENDER BENDER.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
EXCEPT, WAIT.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
GOING ON A HOT

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
CIVIL RIGHTS SCENE.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'M KARDASHIA'S HALF-BROTHER.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
YOU WANTED ME TO STOP
APOLOGIZING, SO I'M SUPPOSED TO

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
HIS SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Tom: I THINK IT'S GREAT!

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
STURDY WAS A VERY PHYSICALLY
IMPOSING MAN, A GRAD STUDENT AT

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Granddad: OH. I'M SORRY.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOUR FINANCES IN ORDER.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'M OKAY -- JUST A LITTLE, UH...

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Ruckus: YOU SEE, FELLOW WHITE
AMERICANS, THIS IS WHY I AM

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
ALL THIS FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE,
AND WHO NEEDS SHOES?!

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
GRANDDAD, YOU GOT YOUR ASS BEAT

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Granddad: UGH!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I DIDN'T KNOW THE KARDASHIANS
HAD A BROTHER.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
FISK UNIVERSITY, CAPTAIN OF THE
FOOTBALL TEAM, TOTALLY FEARLESS.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I THINK I CAN HELP YOU,
MR. FREEMAN.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
RIGHT?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
UGH!

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW I
HAD SOME FLOOZY HALF-SISTER WHO

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
YEAH, SO THEN I GUESS I  WILL
APOLOGIZE, THEN...

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
RUNNIN' FOR MAYOR.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Granddad: KISS MY BLACK ASS.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
MY TOES LIKE TO BE FREE.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
HOWEVER, BASED ON THE STATE OF
YOUR FINANCES, IT WOULD BE

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
AGAIN!

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
NOW, BEIN' BLACK IS BAD -- AIN'T
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT -- AND

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
THIS GUY WAS REALLY A SUPERIOR
HUMAN BEING, COMPLETELY

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
AW, DAMN IT.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
WAS GONNA POP UP.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Granddad: WHY ARE  YOU  HERE
ANYWAY?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I MEAN, ANYBODY CAN LOSE ONCE OR
TWICE, BUT GRANDDAD STAY LOSING!

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I'M OUT OF NAP-B-GONE!

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Huey: I HAD TO CALL IN THE

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
UNLIKELY THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY
AFFORD TO HIRE ME.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
DEDICATED TO THE CAUSE OF
JUSTICE.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Granddad: FAMILY IS A
BLESSING.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Tom: WELL, I HEARD THERE WERE
POSITIONS OPEN IN FREEDOMLAND,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Granddad: WHAT?!

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
SORRY?

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
BEING POOR IS BAD, BUT  THIS
NIGGA HAS THE NERVE TO BE BOTH.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I MIGHT STILL HAVE TIME TO RUN

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
YOU  KNOW  WHAT HAPPENED?!

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Granddad: STURDY.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
NO, IT'S NOT!

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
AND I'M SORT OF A HISTORY BUFF,
IF I MAY SAY SO MYSELF.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
JERRY...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Riley: DO WE KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED?!

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
GET OUT.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
TO THE STORE.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
BOY, I HATED THAT NIGGA.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I  WAS UP NEXT.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
BUT...

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
REVEREND STURDY HARRIS.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
NOW MY SHOW'S PUSHED BACK.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
EVERYBODY  KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED!

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Tom: NOW, HONEY, DON'T DO --
Sarah: GET OUT!

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
BIG GUNS -- SOMEONE WHO LOVED
CAPITALISM AND SMILED AT GIVING

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FRIEND OF SIRI,
UH, I'LL TAKE YOU ON PRO BONO.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
PAY YOUR BILLS, DEADBEAT NIGGA.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
WE AIN'T GOT NO MONEY FOR WAVE

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Granddad: OW!

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
FINALLY, I HAD A CHANCE TO BE
FAMOUS, TO SPEND NEW YEAR'S IN

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
SO I APPLIED!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I CAUGHT THE LAST HALF OF IT ON
THE LIVE STREAM!

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
THEY'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE
VOLUNTEERS.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Tom: I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S PRUDENT TO RECORD AN

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
NOBODY TURN ME AROUND

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Huey: LOOK AT OUR LIVING

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
GETTING BEATEN THAT BAD.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Granddad: IT'LL BE OKAY.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
TRUTH IS YOUR GRANDDADDY HAS

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD FIRST DAY.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Granddad: THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING I CAN DO.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.000
ATTORNEY MEETING.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I'M NOT RECORDING.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
ALWAYS HAD A HARD TIME WITH

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
PLUS, THERE'S LOTS OF LONELY
CUTIES THERE.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
ROOM!

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
YOU CAN CALL ME TOBY, OBAMA,
CLEVELAND...

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
WOULD YOU LIKE SADE OR OCEAN

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
THIS IS A LIVE STREAM.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
ED WUNCLER AND I ARE OLD BUDDIES
NOW.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
WHY IS EVERYONE ACTING BLIND?

06:26.000 --> 06:26.000
WOMEN.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'M NOT VERY FIT.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
THAT'S RIGHT, NIGGA.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
SOUNDS TONIGHT AS YOU SLEEP?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I HAVE TO TRAIN.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
WHAT'S UP?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
HE'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT
WORK, RIGHT?

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
FOR ME

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Riley: EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE
TO ME.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Granddad: AH, LET'S DO SOME
OCEAN SOUNDS.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I HAVE TO BECOME A MASTER
WARRIOR SO I CAN DEFEAT MY ENEMY

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Y'ALL KNOW WHO IT IS --
PRETTY BEEZY FLEE-YEEZEY-WEEZY,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I'M NOT VERY FUNNY.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
THAT IS RIGHT.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I MEAN, LAST WEEK WAS THE FIRST
PAYMENT I MISSED, SO I FIGURE

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
BENCH, TAKE YOUR WONDERFUL
IDEAS AND GO PITCH YOUR OWN

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
YOU KNOW?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I'M NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD AT

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Granddad: WELL, GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT AND ALL YOUR BUS

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
NOW, THERE WILL BE A SHORT BOOT
CAMP TO MAKE SURE YOU NIGGAS ARE

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
IN A REMATCH, PREFERABLY ON
VIDEO SO I CAN POST IT ONLINE

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I APPRECIATE ALL THE LOVE AND
SUPPORT Y'ALL BEEN SENDING ME

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
CONVERSATION.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
A BANJO ON MY

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
THAT I HAVE ABOUT, UH...

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
LORD KNOWS I'M NOT GOOD IN BED.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
SHOW!

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
SINCE THE WHOLE INCIDENT WENT
DOWN.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.000
TUNES.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I'M GOING BACK NORTH.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
ALWAYS HANGING AROUND HERE,
BEING JEALOUS!

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
LIMBER AND DON'T HAVE A MASSIVE
HEART ATTACK WHICH WILL MAKE OUR

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
AND SALVAGE MY DIGNITY!

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
NEVER FEAR.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Riley: I HOPE THAT'S THAT

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
BUT I HAD MONEY, AND AS LONG AS

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
WE'RE JUST LIKE YOU, ROBERT.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
JEALOUS OF WHAT?

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Riley: OOH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN AWESOME PLAN THAT CAN'T GO

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
GOT BIG LAWYERS ON THE CASE.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
WHY BE JEALOUS WHEN I CAN DO
THIS?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
SAY WHAT'S UP TO TOM DuBOIS.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
SHOW THAT BUILDS HOUSES FOR POOR
PEOPLE.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I HAD MONEY, I COULD HAVE A

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
WE FELT LIKE IT WAS TIME TO TAKE
A STAND.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
RICH PATRONS FEEL BAD FOR NOT
VOTING FOR UNIVERSAL

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
YOU ALMOST MADE ME FEEL BAD
ABOUT CUSSING OUT THAT GUY AT

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
MODERATELY SATISFYING SEX LIFE.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
HUH?

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Tom: FLIZZY, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO TURN IT OFF, NOW.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
THIS BUS IS GOING TO FREEDOM.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
WRONG, GRANDDAD!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Granddad: THEN WE GOT TO TURN
THIS BUS AROUND.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
HEALTHCARE.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
THE APPLE STORE.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD TUNE IN
JUST TO SEE YOU DIE!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
>> Riley: UGH.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
SERIOUSLY, I AM LIKE A HUGE
BUSINESS PERSON, OKAY?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Granddad: RUCKUS, YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND!

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
AIN'T GONNA LET
NOBODY TURN ME AROUND

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
BUT NOT REALLY 'CAUSE HE WAS A
DICK.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, ISN'T THAT
EXACTLY WHAT WE DID THE FIRST

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
KILL THE CAMERA, B.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
>> Granddad: NO MORE.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
AAH!

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Tom: I ALSO THINK THESE
PEOPLE SHOULD LEAVE.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
FREEMAN.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
MNH-MNH! DON'T CLAP.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Ruckus: BOY, THE SOUND OF
THAT WHIP SURE IS SWEET.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
TIME THIS HAPPENED?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I'M A BUSINESSWOMAN AND, LIKE,
THIS WHOLE THING, I CAN'T EVEN

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Granddad: YEAH.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
"THESE PEOPLE?"
YOU MEAN "THESE PEOPLE?"

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I'M TIRED OF THIS LAWYER COMING
IN AND JUST SINGING.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Huey: AND YOU ENDED UP
KILLING HIM.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Granddad: EXCUSE ME FOR A
SECOND.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
IT'S LIKE JESUS GENTLY SNAPPING
HIS FINGERS.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
SLEEP TIGHT, ROBERT.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Granddad: YEAH. SEE?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Tom: I MEAN THESE PEOPLE.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
IT'S ME -- ED WUNCLER JR.
Granddad: OH. HUH?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
GOOGLE MYSELF, BECAUSE, LIKE,
TOO MANY HITS COME UP, OKAY?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
CAN'T AN OLD BITCH GET SOME FREE
LEGAL ADVICE, SOME ESTATE

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
THE PLAN WORKED.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
YOU MEAN  MY  PEOPLE, NIGGA!

06:49.000 --> 06:49.000
YOU WITH THEM?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
NO.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
NOW, ROBERT AND TOM, YOU HAVE
GOOD WHITE-MAN NAMES, SO WE WILL

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I DID IT ONCE.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Granddad: WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS FOR?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
YOU'RE A STUPID JERK.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I CAN DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE I
BELIEVE IN MYSELF.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
THESE  MY  PEOPLE.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
YEAH, WE NEVER MET, BUT MY
FATHER TALKS ABOUT YOU SO MUCH,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
PLANNING, AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
TIME AND A HALF.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME YOU
CAN SAY IN FRONT OF THEM.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Granddad: CAN I PAY YOU
DOUBLE TO TURN THE BUS AROUND?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I'M A DANCER. THAT'S RIGHT --
A PROFESSIONAL DANCER.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
GOOD MORNING, ROBERT.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Huey: NO, GRANDDAD, MY POINT
IS --

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Granddad:

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
LEAVE YOUR NAMES BE.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
YOUR NEW FINANCIAL MANAGER WOULD LIKE YOU TO CHECK YOUR

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Granddad: LESS TALK, MORE
TRAINING!

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
IF ANYTHING, NIGGA, YOU THE
STRANGER HERE.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
NO, SIR.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I POP AND LOCK.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
DAD TURNED OVER THE PROPERTY
MANAGEMENT TO ME.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
YEAH, IT DOES SEEM LIKE A WASTE.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
All:

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I POP AND LOCK.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
BUT YOU TWO LITTLE NIGGAS, OH,
YOU HAVE AGGRESSIVE NAMES AND AS

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
ACCOUNT BALANCE.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
LET'S GO!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
SCREW YOU!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Tom: IT'S MY OFFICE.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I'M GERALDINE.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
YOU'RE ONLY HALF-KARDASHIAN.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Granddad: SURE.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Huey: THE MORE YOU FIGHT, THE
MORE  HE  FIGHTS.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
OKAY, THEN, SO WHAT'S THE BIG
SECRET THAT YOU CAN'T

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Riley: WHOA.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Granddad: ROBERT.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
YOU'RE ED THE THIRD'S DAD?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
PLEASED TO MAKE YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
LOOK, ROBERT.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM ANYWAY?!

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
SUCH, THEY WILL BE CHANGED!

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
WHOA! THAT'S...

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
TELL ME IN FRONT OF MY FANS AND
MY PEOPLE?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Granddad: WELL, UH...IT'S A
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
IT'S  YOUR  EGO, GRANDDAD.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
MM. ROBERT, HUH?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY TO
YOU, BUT WE DO HAVE A STRATEGY.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
YOU'RE  THE PROBLEM.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
WHY IS THIS MY FIRST TIME SEEING
YOU?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Both: WHOA!

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
HUEY, YOU ARE NOW "NIGGA ONE" OR
"ONE" FOR SHORT.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Granddad: I'M RISING TO THE
CHALLENGE, REDEEMING MY HONOR!

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MATTER OF FACT, WHY AM I EVEN
HERE?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MR. WUNCLER THE SECOND.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Tom: YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL CASE.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
CALL ME EDDIE.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
WHAT FLOOR YOU LIVE ON?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Granddad: SIT STILL ON THE
DAMN COUCH!

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Huey: THAT'S A NICE WAY TO
SAY YOU WANT PAYBACK.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
CAN I COME IN?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Granddad: STRATEGY?

07:05.000 --> 07:05.000
WHAT?!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Granddad: OH, I DON'T LIVE
HERE.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
A BRILLIANT STRATEGY.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Riley: IT'S NOT ME!

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Granddad: THANK GOD.

07:07.000 --> 07:07.000
IT'S HUEY!

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
RILEY, YOUR NAME IS "NIGGA TWO"
OR "TWO" FOR SHORT.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
WITH ME IN YOUR LIFE, ALL

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF A NIGGA?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT
BEFORE.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Huey: IT'S HER!

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Granddad: I DON'T KNOW.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Tom: I REVIEWED THE CASE, AND
I'VE WATCHED THE SECURITY

07:09.000 --> 07:09.000
IT'S HER BUTT!

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
LOOK HOW BIG IT GOT! IT'S FAKE!

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
SORTS OF GOOD THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Huey: THINK ABOUT IT.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN -- SEEMS
LIKE A LOVELY PLACE.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I LOVE STRATEGY.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
LAY IT ON ME.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
TWO, TOTE THAT BALE OF HAY TO MY
HORSE, WHO I HAVE AFFECTIONATELY

07:12.000 --> 07:12.000
FOOTAGE.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
COOL. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
OH, MY GOODNESS. LOOK AT THIS.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
THE MOST BRILLIANT STRATEGY
EVER CONCEIVED -- NONVIOLENT

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Granddad: I LOVE YOU, SIRI.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Granddad: MR. ROGERS?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Tom: ALL RIGHT, JOKE TIME.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
WOW, NO ONE'S EVER SAID THAT

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Huey: PERFECT.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
CAN YOU GET ME OFF?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
WHAT A LOVELY HOME.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
IS THIS THING ON? NO?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
NAMED "NIGGER."

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
CAN YOU IMAGINE MR. ROGERS IN A
NIGGA MOMENT?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Tom: DID YOU ROB THE LIQUOR
STORE, FLIZZY?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
WELL, DID YOU TRY IT?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
DIRECT ACTION.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
HUEY'S BUTT ACCUSATION -- IT
REALLY HURT ME.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
EVEN THOUGH HE IS WHITE, HE HAS
WIDE NOSTRILS.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
TO ME BEFORE.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
THE COUCH IS...UH, BEAUTIFUL,
WITH THE...THE CARPET.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Granddad: COME AGAIN?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I CAN'T SAY THAT...I DID IT,
BUT, HONESTLY, REALLY CAN'T SAY

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
ALL RIGHT.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
YOU CONFRONT THE OPPRESSOR
AND HIS UNJUST SYSTEM.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
SO I DECIDED TO BE THE STRONG,
TOUGH WOMAN I AM AND GIVE HIM A

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Granddad: OF COURSE NOT!

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S INVISIBLE AND
SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Riley: OLD NIGGER GONNA DIE
TODAY 'CAUSE HE AIN'T GETTIN'

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
OH, I-I'M SORRY.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
INCITE HIM TO VIOLENCE WITHOUT
RESORTING TO VIOLENCE YOURSELF.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Riley: COME ON, HUEY, LOOK AT
THIS!

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Huey: SO TO END A NIGGA
MOMENT, YOU HAVE TO BE

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
THIS IS MY ASSISTANT,
VANDERBILT.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
PIECE OF MY MIND.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
JACK.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
HOW CAN YOU HATE ON THIS,
REALLY?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
MR. ROGERS, AND WHAT WOULD
MR. ROGERS DO?

07:22.000 --> 07:22.000
F'SHO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Tom: AND WHY CAN'T YOU SAY
"F'SHO"?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
YOU DO HAVE A LOVELY HOME.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
MY FARTS AFTER I DRINK
ENSURE.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Granddad: WHY WOULD WE DO
THAT?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Tom: RUCKUS, THIS IS
INHUMANE!

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
WE'RE GONNA BE

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
TO PROVE OUR MORAL
SUPERIORITY.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Ruckus: WHO THE HELL SAID
THAT NIGGAS WAS HUMAN IN THE

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
EVEN  YOU  CAN'T HATE ON THIS!

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Granddad: I'M SORRY, BABY.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, THIS CAN'T BE
LEGAL.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
HE WOULD FOLLOW NORMAL
WHITE-PEOPLE RULES.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
UP!

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I  used to have a lovely home.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
RICH.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Tom: WHAT?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Granddad: SO, WE MAKE THEM
WANT TO ATTACK US?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
FIRST PLACE?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Tom: AND HOW ABOUT THESE --
HOW ABOUT YOUR ENTOURAGE?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE...

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
>> Tom: YEAH, MY HAIR'S SO SILKY

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
NO. EW. ICK. GROSS.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
ONE, GET NIGGER SOME CARROTS!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Granddad: YES, IT IS!

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
SO IF STINKMEANER CONFRONTED
MR. ROGERS IN A PARKING

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
SMOOTH.

07:27.000 --> 07:27.000
YES.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
IT'S MY NEW BUSINESS MANAGER.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
MM-HMM? HMM.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
>> Riley: I LIKE YOUR HAIR.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Granddad: AND THEN WE LET
THEM?

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Granddad: APOLOGIZE!

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Huey: A BUSINESS MANAGER
CAN'T MAKE MONEY APPEAR IN YOUR

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
LOT...

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
DO THEY KNOW ANYTHING?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
IT'S LIKE YOU KIND OF GOT THAT

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
THAT IS NO-- GAH.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
EXACTLY.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Granddad: OH, YEAH, HE
WOULDN'T FIGHT.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
UP, TOO!

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
J. LO THING GOING ON -- YOU

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
NO, THAT'S --
THAT'S NOT THE PUNCH--

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Granddad: AND WE DON'T FIGHT
BACK?

07:30.000 --> 07:30.000
UH-OH.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
ONE, IS YOU DEFYING ME, BOY?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
HEY, MAN, WHEN WE GO OUT, WE GO
HARD.

07:31.000 --> 07:31.000
SO, LOOK.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
KNOW, KIND OF LIKE THE WHITE

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
NO.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
BANK ACCOUNT.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
HE WOULD WALK AWAY AND CALL THE
POLICE.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
GIRLS.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
OH, GOD.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Granddad: WHAT ABOUT
SELF-DEFENSE?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
WE HAVE NO MONEY!

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
COMPLICATED IT IS BEING ME.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
IT SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES IN
HERE NOW.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Huey: SORRY.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Granddad: HUEY, YOU BETTER
LISTEN TO THIS FOOL BEFORE HE

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Granddad: WELL, THANKS TO
SIRI, WE DO NOW.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Huey: AND IF HE KEEPS
COMING BACK?

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY WHERE I NEED
TO BE WITH THE HOUSE.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
THE ONLY SELF-DEFENSE ALLOWED IS
SINGING AND A SPECIAL KIND OF

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Granddad: FILE A COMPLAINT,
GET A RESTRAINING ORDER.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
IT'S PRETTY HOT.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS. COME ON.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
YOU'RE TAKING THEIR SIDE!

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
HITS YOU WITH THAT WHIP.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO THINK
POSITIVE.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
ALL THE TIME I
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I SAID.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
>> Jazmine: I'M THE MOST

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
IT'LL BE MORE FUN THAN THIS.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
NONVIOLENT MARTIAL ART WHICH
PROTECTS YOUR ATTACKER AT ALL

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
YOU'RE NEVER ON MY SIDE!

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, I'M NOBODY'S
PROPERTY, AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Riley: NIGGA, IT'S FREE
MONEY!

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
EVENTUALLY, THEY WOULD PUT
STINKMEANER IN JAIL.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Tom: HOW?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
HOW CAN YOU HATE ON FREE MONEY?!

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
'CAUSE I GOT LIKE 18 PEOPLE
TWEETING FOR ME AT ONE TIME.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Ruckus: DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHEN HE SIGNED HIS FREEDOM AWAY

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Riley: BUT THEN HE HAS TO
SNITCH, AND THEN I GOT TO LIVE

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Granddad: YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, ROBERT!

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
TIMES -- "HARD CHIN, SOFT HAND."

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Granddad: OH SIRI, IF ONLY I

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
LOOK, I'M JUST HERE TO GET
YOU THE  OUT.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Granddad: IF THESE CAMERAS
WEREN'T ON, I'D BEAT YOU SO BAD,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
UP!

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
THIS IS GONNA REVOLUTIONIZE THE

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
COULD FIND A REAL WOMAN JUST AS
AMAZING AS YOU.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
WITH THAT SHAME!

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
SO, LIKE, I LOOK AT THE TAPE AND
I SAY, "IS IT ME, OR IS IT

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
WHOLE BLACK-HAIR-CARE INDUSTRY.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Granddad: DO YOU EVEN HEAR
YOURSELVES?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
SHOOT, YOU NIGGAS SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL YOU NOT WORKING AT

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
CERTAINLY, THERE'S SOMEONE IN

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
STINKMEANER GET AWAY WITH
BEATING ME IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
YOU'RE SITTING ON A GOLD MINE.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
WE ARE READY FOR ANYTHING,
ROBERT.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
YOU'D LOOK LIKE IMPRESSIONIST
ART.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
SOMEONE I JUST PAID TO ROB A
LIQUOR STORE WHO LOOKS JUST LIKE

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
AAH!

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
SUB-SAHARAN FOOD BANK LAND.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
YOUR LIFE  JUST  LIKE ME YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
>> Granddad: OH, THANK YOU,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
THEY CAN ARREST US, BEAT US.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
OH, SO YOU DID LIKE THE MONET

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I NEVER GET REDEMPTION!

07:48.000 --> 07:48.000

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
>> Granddad: OH, THANK YOU,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Granddad: OHH!

Granddad: BEAT US?

07:48.000 --> 07:48.000
TOM!

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Tom: YES, RUCKUS?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Granddad: WELL, I HAVEN'T
FOUND HER.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Huey: BUT IT ENDS.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
ME?"
I DON'T KNOW.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
BELIEVE IN YOU, IT WOULD PAY OFF

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I THINK, AS A PEOPLE, WE'VE
TAKEN ENOUGH BEATINGS.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
PAINTING I SENT YOU.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Granddad: YOU'RE SAYING THAT
I SHOULD JUST LET HIM GET AWAY

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
SOMEDAY.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
HEY, WHAT THE --

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I TOLD YOU!

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Ruckus: FROM NOW ON, MY NAME
IS NOT RUCKUS.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
YOU DON'T KNOW THE KIND OF BAD
LUCK I'VE HAD WITH WOMEN.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Tom: OKAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
UP FRONT THAT I HAVE SERIOUS

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
OH, YOU SHOULDA
SEEN YOUR FACE.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
>> Tom: SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
DON'T YOU THINK?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
WITH BEATING ME IN FRONT OF THE
WHOLE  WORLD?!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
>> Riley: YEAH, HOW DO WE GET

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
BEAT US, STAB US, SIC DOGS ON
US, LIGHT US ON FIRE.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
IT IS BOSS!

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
ISSUES WITH SOME OF YOUR
BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST, ESPECIALLY

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
PAID?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
MM. MM! OOH!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Granddad: TAKE YOUR ASS
OUTSIDE!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Tom:

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
NO, I'VE GIVEN UP.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Huey: IF YOU WANT THIS TO
FINALLY END,  YES.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
ROBERT, IT'S ME.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000

Granddad: LIGHT US ON FIRE?!

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
Granddad: YOU TOO!

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
JUST TELL ME WHAT KIND OF WOMEN YOU LIKE.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Granddad: NO, I CAN'T DO
THAT.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
HITTING A WOMAN.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I'D NEVER KICK YOU OUT OF HERE.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
THERE'S A LOT THAT HAS TO BE

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
HE'S CLEAN!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
NOT THAT WE'RE EXPECTING
THAT.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Ruckus: YOU TOUGH, HUH?

07:57.000 --> 07:57.000
B-BUT WAIT.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I KNEW YOU WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
DONE BEFORE YOU CAN BRING

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I'LL FIND AND CONTACT THEM VIA E-MAIL AND RUN THEM PAST YOU

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I GOT PRIDE. I'M STRONG.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,
THOUGH?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO MARKET.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
BUT WE ARE PREPARED FOR THAT
TO HAPPEN.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
WELL, WE GOT WAYS OF DEALING
WITH YOUR TYPE.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
POCKET CHANGE.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
YOU NEED A BUSINESS PLAN,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
NO WOMAN WANTS A MAN WHO FILES
A RESTRAINING ORDER IN THE FACE

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Tom: NO, I DON'T --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
LAWYERS, DISTRIBUTION.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
ROBERT, COME. HAVE A SEAT.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Granddad: YOU CAN'T GET
PREPARED TO GET LIT ON FIRE!

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
FOR SCREENING AND APPROVAL.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
DON'T NEED THAT.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Huey: MAN, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH HER?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
THOUGH?

08:02.000 --> 08:02.000
HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS STUFF DO

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
YOU HAVE?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
IN DEFENSE OF ROBERT, THE
STRATEGY OF NONVIOLENT DIRECT

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
YOU CAN MEET THEM AT YOUR LEISURE.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.000
OF DANGER.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I WANT AN ERECTION!

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Tom: NO, FLIZZY, THERE'S --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
HEY, YOU CHECK FOR HOLLOWED-OUT
SPACES, EH?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
>> Granddad: I'M NOT SURE.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Granddad: YOU WOULD DO THAT
FOR ME?!

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
YOU REMEMBER THOSE
NUNS WAS TRYIN' TO HIDE

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I GOT IT FROM HUEY.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
ACTION, WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK
ABOUT IT, IS COMPLETELY INSANE.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Huey:  IN MODERN AMERICA, WHO WOULD BELIEVE PEOPLE WOULD WANT

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Huey: HOW MANY TIMES IN LIFE
DO YOU GET A SECOND CHANCE,

08:05.000 --> 08:05.000
THOUGH?!

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Tom: FINE! WHAT?!

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
>> Tom: WELL, WHERE DID HE GET

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
SO, ROBERT, WHAT BROUGHT YOU
HERE TODAY?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Riley: I DON'T KNOW.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
OF COURSE.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.000

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
>> Huey: HEY, GRANDDAD.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Huey: HER BUTT KEEPS GETTING
BIGGER.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Granddad: OKAY.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
THE THORNY CROWN IN THE WALL?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
TO BE ENTERTAINED BY SLAVES?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
DO YOU NEED MY PASSWORDS?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
GRANDDAD?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
UP!

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
SISTERS RIGHT THERE.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT CONTAINER OF

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Granddad: AM I ABOUT TO GET
JUMPED INTO SOME GRAY PANTHERS

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
YOU HAVE TO TRUST US, ROBERT.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I ALREADY HAVE THEM.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
A CHANCE TO FIX YOUR BIGGEST
MISTAKE?

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Riley: HEY, MAN, WHY YOU
STEALIN' OUR STUFF?!

08:09.000 --> 08:09.000
PINK GEL I WAS --

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
>> Granddad: HEY, HUEY.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
IT SEEMS KIND OF CRAZY.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND FOR A

SOMETIMES, I GUESS.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.000

Do you hear me?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Granddad: LOVE 'EM.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
THAT BLACK SUMBITCH!

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Fake...your...deaths.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
>> Riley: HEY, THAT SHOULD BE

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
GOOD. LET ME BACK UP A BIT.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
BOY, I'MA HAVE TO KICK HIS ASS
WHEN I SEE HIM.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
BUT IT'S JUST SO MUCH FUN.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Come on!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Tom: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, OKAY.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
THE NAME -- "BOMB WAVE CREAM."

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
KNOW WHY WE'RE BROKE, ROBERT?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
IS ILLEGAL.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I APOLOGIZE, ROBERT.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
SLOW DOWN.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Ruckus: ROBERT FREEMAN WAS
THERE?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
EH, NOT REALLY.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Huey:  IN ORDER TO KEEP RUCKUS' WHIP OFF MY GRANDAD'S

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I'M AFRAID THAT WASN'T AS FRUITFUL AS I HAD HOPED.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
"FLUID SWAP"?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
>> Granddad: GOOD IDEA.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
BECAUSE OUR GENERATION RAISED
NO-GOOD, SELFISH-ASS SONS.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I'M PUTTING USED JELL-O SHOTS
AND PETROLEUM IN YOUR ASS.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
"RUB AGAINST MY ERECTION"?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
WELL, AIN'T THAT SOMETHING?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
THE FIRST WAS A TERMINAL BORE, THE SECOND A NARCISSISTIC HAG,

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
WRITE IT DOWN BEFORE WE FORGET.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
BACK, EVEN  I  WAS FORCED TO COOPERATE.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Granddad: SOMETHING'S WRONG.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH"?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
>> Huey: DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I ASKED MY SON TO VISIT ME.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
THAT CAVE...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
ONE SPARK, AND HEADS COULD

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
SMALL WORLD.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
THE THIRD HAD BODY ODOR SO BAD
I  COULD SMELL IT, AND THE LAST

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I LOVE
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
HE SAID, "I'M BUSY, MAMA."

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
BULL CONNOR MADE AN
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
IT WAS A VERY LONG DAY.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I FEEL COLD.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
ACTUALLY EXPLODE.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
YEAH, NIGGA WAS BUSY, ALL
RIGHT -- SNATCHIN' A PURSE.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
OKAY, HOW ABOUT A GAME-SHOW

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
THAT PLACE -- IT IS STRONG
WITH THE DARK SIDE.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
OH, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET
HIM TO SING AT JAZMINE'S

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
>> Riley: "BOMB WAVE CREAM -- AN

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
KU KLUX KLAN.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Ruckus: PAY NO ATTENTION TO
THE BALLOON.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
ONE HAD THAT GOD-AWFUL LAUGH.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
THEIR MOBS WOULD BE ALLOWED 15
MINUTES TO DO ANYTHING TO THE

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
IT WON'T INFLATE.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Granddad: OH, COME ON.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
EXPLOSIONOF BEAUTIFUL HAIR."  ■

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
THAT'S JUST TO GIVE THE GAME A
SENSE OF FUN.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
THEY WEREN'T THAT BAD.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
MM, A DOMAIN OF EVIL, IT IS.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
BIRTHDAY?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
>> Granddad: OHH.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
I'M TELLING YOU, EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF OUR BOYS AGE 30 TO 50 --

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
NOW, IF YOU WILL ALL REACH UNDER
YOUR CHAIRS, YOU'LL FIND WATER

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
IN YOU MUST GO.

09:19.000 --> 09:19.000
Tom: NO! DO YOU LET HER
LISTEN TO THAT?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Granddad: WHAT'S IN THERE?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Sarah: OUR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
ROUGH ON HER.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I LIKE THAT.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
RIDERS WITHOUT FEAR OF ARREST.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
ROBERT, NONE OF THOSE WOMEN WERE WORTH YOUR TIME.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD, YOU'RE GONNA

IDEA?

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
ONLY WHAT YOU TAKE WITH YOU.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
IT WOULD BE NICE TO, YOU KNOW...

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
HUH?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000

THEY'RE STUCK ON STUPID AND
FASTENED TO -UP.

Ruckus: OH, SURE.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
"BOXERS OR BRIEFS."

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
CANNONS.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Granddad: SIRI, I LIKED THE
SECOND ONE OKAY.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
>> Granddad: WE'LL PUT A WARNING

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
IT STARTS WITH BUSES.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
IF THE CONTESTANT GUESSES WRONG,
THEY HAVE TO SLEEP WITH

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
WHAT?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
FREEMAN.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
LABEL ON IT -- "WARNING,

INTEGRATE SCHOOLS AND

SHE WASN'T BAD.

I'D LIKE TO TAKE HER OUT TO
DINNER.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
YOUR WEAPONS -- YOU WILL NOT
NEED THEM.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Tom: DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
FLAMMABLE."

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
AN OLD-SCHOOL MAN LIKE YOU
YOUNG LADIES WOULD

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
MORAL DILEMMA SOLVED.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Granddad: YOU KNOW, IT'S
NEVER BAD TO HAVE TWO IDEAS WHEN

Both: HUH?

CAN I SAY THAT? YES, I CAN.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
REALLY APPRECIATE.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
DESPERATE BUT HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Granddad: YEAH, WHATEVER.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
THEIR BRAIN GETS SUCKED OUT.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
PRODUCTS, ALTHOUGH I STARTED TO

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
THIS  IS  YOUR HOME.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Granddad: SIRI, DID YOU SEE
THAT?!

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
HE'S GETTING IN HIS CAR.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
SUSPECT HER OPERATION MIGHT NOT

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
THERE WAS THIS ONE RAPPER WHO
WENT FROM SAYING "GEORGE BUSH

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
OH, NO, SERIOUSLY, YOU NIGGAS

MUCH, BUT A NIGGA CAN TAKE AN

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I'M YOU!

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Granddad: AAH!

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
YOU DON'T HAVE MY MONEY?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
>> THIS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
LIVE HERE NOW.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
SIRI, WHAT DID YOU DO?!

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Tom: YOU'RE A SELFISH
BASTARD, ROBERT FREEMAN!

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
NORMALLY, I TRY TO TALK PEOPLE

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
ASS-WHUPPING, I PROMISE!

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Huey: GRANDDAD WAS DEFINITELY
HAPPIER SINCE HE CAME BACK FROM

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
THEY WERE HEADED INTO A TRAP.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I SAW KARDASHIA AT A PLACE
CALLED FAKE CAKES.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Huey:  IN RETROSPECT, NONE OF US SHOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Granddad: HEY, YOU, I ASKED

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
A'IGHT. EDDIE. THINK.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL, VERY

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
FOR THE NICE CHICK IN THE
COMMERCIAL, NOT THIS CRAZY

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
THE OLD-FOLKS' HOME.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
WHEN WE PULLED INTO THE
BIRMINGHAM STATION, THERE WAS A

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
IT'S NEAR THAT ILLEGAL PINOCHLE
SPOT WHERE YOU USED TO LEAVE ME

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
FOR DECADES, PEOPLE ALLOWED THE MIDDLE CLASS TO WITHER AND DIE.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
WAIT! I GOT IT!

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
SPECIAL.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I GUESS THERE  IS  SOMETHING TO
VOLUNTEERING.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Granddad: WHAT?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
MOB OF AT LEAST 200 PEOPLE
THERE.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
BITCH YOU SOLD ME!

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
THE HOUSE.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
THIS ISN'T JUST HAIR RELAXER.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Granddad: HUEY, DRENCH MY
BACK.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000

Riley: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Tom: I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT, FLIZZY.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
WE CAN MAKE MONEY OFF THE
HOUSE -- TOGETHER.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
THIS IS ART.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW WHAT
KIND OF "REALITY" YOU'RE

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Ruckus: YES.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Riley: AW, NO!

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
THE BUS WAS SURROUNDED, AND
THEY WERE CALLING US ALL KINDS

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
WELCOME HOME, NIGGAS.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000

Granddad: RUCKUS, THIS IS
INSANE!

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
PROBLEM?

10:25.000 --> 10:25.000
WHY NOT?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
WE RENT OUT EACH OF THE ROOMS AS
A SEPARATE UNIT -- TWO BEDROOMS,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Granddad: WHAT I'M GETTING?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
WE'RE GENIUSES, NOT MIND
READERS.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.000
Tom: WELL, IT'S NOT YOU.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000

NIGGER-LOVER, MOON CRICKET,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I'M GETTING LAID.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
YOU CAN'T KEEP US HERE!

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000

10:27.000 --> 10:27.000
IT'S ME.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
WE USED YOUR GEL ON THE LEFT

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I'M GETTING MONEY.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Ruckus: WELL, LOOKS TO ME
LIKE I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Granddad: YOU AIN'T NO
GENIUSES!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Granddad: NIGGA, HUSH!

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'M JUST DEALING WITH SOME
PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
GUEST ROOM, LIVING ROOM AND
KITCHEN, ATTIC -- HOW MUCH IS

10:28.000 --> 10:28.000
SANDWICHES?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Granddad: I'M NOT GOING ON A
DATE.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'M GETTING OUR FREEDOM PAPERS.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
UH, YES, I-I JUST WANT TO MAKE

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
HALF OF HOT CHOCOLATE'S HAIR.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
FREE-LANCE HONEY BADGER.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
AND WITH THOSE THREE THINGS,
NOTHING CAN EVER GO WRONG!

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
TO, SLAVE.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SELL THESE
THINGS TO PEOPLE.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
>> BITCHES BE HATIN'.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
OH, "SLAVE."

10:31.000 --> 10:31.000
COME ON, TOM!

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW I GOT A JOB.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
LISTEN TO THAT.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000

MOUTH.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
SURE THAT THE SERGEANT KNOW IT'S
ROBERT FREEMAN.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE BOTH LETTING
THE HATERS GET US DOWN.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
MORE THAN YOU'RE GETTING NOW,
SIR.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
"FREE-LANCE HONEY BADGER"?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
NOW TAKE THIS ONE AWAY AND GET
ME A NICE ONE!

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
THIS IS BETTER THAN WHITE-BITCH

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Huey: WHAT KIND OF JOB WEARS
SUITS ON THE NIGHT SHIFT?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I THINK THEY WERE JUST MAKING UP
WORDS AFTER AWHILE.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
WHAT A JOYOUS FEELING IT IS JUST
TO SAY THAT WORD.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
WE GOT TO SHAKE THE HATERS.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
GOD, I LIKE YOU.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
MAY I SEE YOUR PHONE, PLEASE?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I'M AT THE MALL, AND I'M GONNA
BE ATTACKED BY THIS CRAZY NIGGA

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Granddad: WHAT DO WE THINK
ABOUT...HAVING PEOPLE MOVE IN

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
HAIR.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Granddad: LOTS OF IMPORTANT
JOBS -- VALET AND PIMPS.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
DO THIS FOR ME, TOM.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
THIS IS DAMN NEAR

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
AAH!

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
IT'S LIKE SAYING "LOVE" OR
"REAGANOMICS."

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
COME ON. SHAKE THOSE HATERS.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
HERE?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
AT ANY TIME.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I'M HATE-FREE, BUT I CAN STILL
FEEL THE HATE ON YOU.

10:38.000 --> 10:38.000
GENIUS, RIGHT?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Huey: WHOA. WAIT.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
VIRGIN-CAMBODIAN-BITCH QUALITY.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Huey: WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
MAYBE I'M NAIVE, BUT I JUST GET
THE FEELING THAT YOU LIKE ME FOR

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
OKAY?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Granddad: HUSH.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
OH, MY GOD!

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Riley: YEAH, MAN, SLOW DOWN.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
>> Granddad: SO, I CAN PRESUME

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT I AM.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
WE WERE ALL PRETTY SCARED,
AND THEN STURDY JUST STOOD UP,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Tom: PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY
LIVE HERE, DO THEY?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
IS THIS YOUR WALLPAPER?!

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
SO THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
MMM. FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I'M TELLIN' YA, IT'LL BE

YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PLACING AN

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
WHAT A HORRIBLE THING TO DO WITH
FRUIT!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
OKAY, JUST MAKING SURE.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
IT'LL BE LIKE A COMMUNE.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
BEHAVING FOR THE BABYSITTER.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000

NO, WAIT, THAT'S NOT MINE!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
NOW WILL YOU TAKE THE CASE?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
HUEY, YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF
PEOPLE TO TALK TO AND SHARE ALL

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
WHO NEEDS THAT?

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
OH, IT'S NOT AS BAD AS, SAY,

I MEAN, I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
'CAUSE IF I GOOGLE "BITCH

IT'LL BE LIKE OCCUPY, BUT RIGHT

EVEN IF YOUR MAN DOESN'T HAVE A
401.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
THIS IS MORE LIKE AN NFL
TRAINING CAMP.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ME -- SEXY,
BUFF ALPHA MALE -- AND YOU --

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000

OTHER HOUSE.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
A MARATHON THAT LONG WOULD WRECK
MY KNEES.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I'M AN ESCORT.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
ABLE TO HELP EACH OTHER.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000

HEY, LOOK WHO'S COMING.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.000
IS THAT IT?!

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Ruckus: OH, THE MASSA LOVES

AND SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Granddad: HELL, NO!

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SUCH
DICKS, RIGHT?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Granddad: I WILL NOT FIGHT
YOU, STINKMEANER.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Granddad: WHOA!

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Tom: RUCKUS, I HATE TO BREAK
MY AMUSEMENT-PARK CHARACTER AND

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Granddad: I FEEL THE SAME
WAY.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Tom: YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
We need to get up out of here,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Riley: WELL, THAT'S ALL

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
WHAT'S THE ATTITUDE FOR?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
SAY WHAT, NIGGA?!

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
WHY NOT?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Granddad.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
YOU KNEW I APPRECIATED THE FINER
THINGS BEFORE WE GOT PROMISED!

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
YOU NOT GONNA FIGHT?!

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO
DANCE, RIGHT?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
>> Granddad: LEAVE? WHY?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
ACTUALLY, THAT'S KIND OF
GANGSTA.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
THEN WHY'D YOU COME?!

YOU'S A BITCH OVER THE PHONE!

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000

THE BIG DEAL IS.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
UNH!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Granddad: I CAME BECAUSE I'M
NOT AFRAID OF YOU!

OH. MY. GOD!

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Riley: DAMN, AIN'T I PUNISHED
ENOUGH?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
IT WORKED.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE
BATHROOM.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
HARDER YOU THINK I'M WORKING --
I THINK I'VE FIGURED OUT THE

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
NO, I  DIDN'T  ORDER A SHIPMENT OF
PINK, DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED iPHONE

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
FIRST I GOT TO BE A SLAVE, NOW
YOU SAYIN' IT'S MY FAULT.

12:05.000 --> 12:14.000
IT WORKED.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Granddad:

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
PROBLEM.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
THAT'S WHAT ALL WOMEN WANT.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
EXPLOSIVE?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
OHH, ROBERT!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
CASES!

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
HER ASS EXPLODED.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Tom: THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT,
FREEMANS!

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
HOW YOU GONNA THREATEN TO CALL
THE POLICE ON ME?!

12:09.000 --> 12:09.000
Tom: WHY?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
YOU THINK THEM BITCHES OUT THERE

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'LL GET YOU, YOU BLACK SLUT!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE NO
SELF-RESPECT!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
CARE ABOUT A LITTLE FIRE?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I HAVE FRIENDS WITH LOTS OF
EXTRA ASS!

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I PAY MY MORTGAGE ON TIME!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
IT'S  MY  ACCOUNT!

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Tom: WELL, MY WIFE HAS

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
THIS HERE WILL TURN YOUR BRAIN

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
CAN WE DONATE?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I EARNED MY FREEDOM!

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I'VE BEEN HACKED!

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
ROBERT, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
NONVIOLENT!

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH ON
FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHEN A

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Granddad: TOM, STOP GRIPING.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
MY IDENTITY HAS BEEN STOLEN!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
SELF-RESPECT.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
GREEN.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
HEY!

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
REALLY? YOU SURE?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
THIS STUFF HAS PLUTONIUM.

12:15.000 --> 12:15.000
HER?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Granddad: NO.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
PERSON'S ASS GETS THIS BIG, BUT
I'M AFRAID WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
YOU GOT CONNECTIONS ON THE
OUTSIDE.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Tom: YES!

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
HER?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Granddad: UNH-UNH.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
YOU CAN CALL ONE OF YOUR LEGAL
FRIENDS AND GET YOUR ASS OUT!

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
SHE'S AN EDUCATED, WELL-ROUNDED,
CONFIDENT WOMAN.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
THIS ONE HERE IS ACID.

12:17.000 --> 12:17.000
Granddad: NO!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Tom: YOU NASTY, SICK MAN!

12:18.000 --> 12:18.000
HER?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Granddad: NOPE.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
HEY, YOU BIG, OLD PICKANINNY!

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
THAT'S IT!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
JUST ACID.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
AND WHAT ABOUT HER?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Tom: CALL?!

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
YOU'RE DISGUSTING!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
ED WUNCLER, MY FAVORITE
BILLIONAIRE!

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I MAY NEED TO MEET HER.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
HE RENTED MY BATHROOM!

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Granddad: NO, MARGE SIMPSON'S
NOT PRETTIER THAN YOU, EITHER!

12:20.000 --> 12:20.000
HOLD STILL!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
DID YOU SAY "CALL?!"
OH, I'M SORRY!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF,
YOU FILTHY TURD OF A MAN?!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Tom: NO, NO, NO. NO.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
OH, THAT'S THE WHOLE HOUSE.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
DON'T YOU GET IT?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST CASES
OF AAAS I'VE EVER SEEN.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I KNOW WHERE THIS GOES.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
A MAN CAN'T TRULY CALL HIMSELF A
MAN ONCE A STRANGER'S ASS CHEEKS

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
THESE BITCHES WOULD PUT NAPALM

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
HUH?!

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Granddad: HUH?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
YOU'RE PRETTIER THAN TONIGHT'S
ENTIRE LINEUP AND ALL OF BASIC

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
WELL, I HEARD ABOUT YOUR
LITTLE INCIDENT, AND I WANTED TO

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MY WIFE.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
ON THEIR HAIR IF IT WOULD MAKE

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
THAT'S A.A.A.S. -- ASS
AUGMENTATION ADDICTION SYNDROME.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
MASSA DIDN'T PROVIDE ME WITH A

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Tom: HOW COULD YOU PUT THAT
ON YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE?!

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
DO YOUR WIFE?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
IT STRAIGHT.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
AAH!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
TOM, I WOULDN'T DO YOUR WIFE.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
HAVE BEEN ON HIS PRIVATE TOILET!

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
PUT A WARNING LABEL ON IT.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
CABLE!

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
PHONE!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
MY DAUGHTER IS FRIENDS WITH YOU
ON FACEBOOK!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
SEE IF YOU WERE OKAY.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Tom: YOU HAVE A SONG CALLED
"I WILL DO YOUR WIFE!"

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Riley: THIS ALL YOUR FAULT,
GRANDDAD.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
OH, THANK YOU.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Granddad: OH, I'M FINE.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
OW!

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Granddad: DOC, YOU GOT TO
MAKE HER LIVE!

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
YOU REALLY TURNED OUR LIFE INTO
"GOOD TIMES."

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
SORRY.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
YOU'RE GONNA ROT IN
H-E-DOUBLE  HOCKEY STICKS

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I
BROUGHT A FRIEND OVER.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I DIDN'T MEAN  YOUR  WIFE!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Granddad: OUR LIFE IS NOT
"GOOD TIMES."

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
FAIR?

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
WHAT I MEANT WAS WE'RE IN THIS
TOGETHER.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
FOR THIS, ROBERT!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
WHAT'S GOOD, NIGGA?!

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
LIFE TENDS NOT TO BE FAIR WHEN
YOU START SHOVING FOREIGN

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I MEANT THAT METAPHORICALLY.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
WE STILL LIVE IN A NICE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Granddad: WAIT, NO!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
YOU THOUGHT YOU GOT RID OF ME?!

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Riley: YEAH, FOR NOW.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
YES! YES!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Granddad: OOH!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
OBJECTS INTO YOUR KEISTER.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
WHAT DID I PUT ON MY FACEBOOK?!

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Tom: MM, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Huey: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET A
JOB, GRANDDAD.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I WON'T BE FREE UNTIL WE'RE ALL
FREE!

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
THAT NIGGER BITCH IS MINE!

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
NIGGA, I SWEAR ON MY ABS --
ON MY ABS, NIGGA! -- I WILL NOT

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Granddad: WHY DO  I  HAVE TO
GET A JOB?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
OH, GOD, I'VE BEEN SO LONELY!

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
WE'VE GOT A DEDICATED TEAM OF
DOCTORS HERE.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
DAMN IT, I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT
HOW TO CHECK MY FACEBOOK FROM

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Ruckus: TOM, SARAH BOUGHT
YOUR FREEDOM.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
WHY CAN'T Y'ALL GET JOBS?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
THIS DAMN PHONE!

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Huey: CHILD LABOR LAWS,
UNSAFE WORKPLACES, REALLY SMALL

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
OH, YES!

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
AAH!

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I PROMISE, WE'LL TRY OUR BEST.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
YOU CAN GO.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
HELLO?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
TOUCH YOUR WIFE.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I LOVE THIS GUY -- SO
ENTERTAINING!

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Tom: WELL, MY DAUGHTER WOULD
LOVE TO MEET YOU.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
CUDDLE ME HARDER!

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
GET EVERYBODY BACK TO THE BUS!

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Tom: WELL, GUYS, IT'S BEEN
REAL.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
CALL THE CHAPLAIN AND THE MORGUE

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Granddad: BUT HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE IN JAIL!

12:44.000 --> 12:44.000
HANDS.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Granddad: OHH.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
RUCKUS, YOU'VE DONE SOME STUPID

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
A SMALL DINNER.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.000
Granddad: THAT'S GARBAGE!

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
YOUR GENERATION IS JUST LAZY,
THAT'S ALL.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.000
ROBERT.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Granddad: AAH!

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
NO ENTOURAGE!

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING USED
FOR SEX.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
FOR THE STUPID GIRL IN THE ASS
ROOM!

12:46.000 --> 12:46.000
AN  ANDROID?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I KNOW, YES.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
NO PROBLEM.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
PLUS, WHO'S EVEN HIRING NOW?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Granddad: SIRI?! GOD DAMN IT!

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO BAIL
HIM OUT, AS WELL AS BRIBE THE

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
AAH!

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Granddad: COME ON!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
YOU BETTER BE CALLING ME FROM
THE LANDFILL!

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THESE

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I'M GETTING LESS SEX THAN
BEFORE.

12:50.000 --> 12:50.000
LIKE SOME SIGN-LANGUAGE

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
SHIT, BUT COME ON, THIS IS
INSANE!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
NO, ROBERT, I'M CALLING YOU

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO DROP THE
CASE.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
AW, COME ON.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
THAT LAST DATE, VANESSA --

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
WE JUST CAN'T SIT AROUND HERE
AND WAIT!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
NO! AAH!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
YOU REALLY SHOULD STOP
SNITCHING, ROBERT.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I THOUGHT YOU GAVE UP WORK TO
RUN FOR MAYOR.

12:53.000 --> 12:53.000
I KNOW!

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
WE'LL START A WALK-A-THON!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
WE ARE FRIENDS!

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
PEOPLE SHOWED UP.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Ruckus: I DIDN'T GIVE UP
WORK.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Ruckus: "FRIENDS"?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Tom: WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
HADN'T TWEETED OUR ADDRESS TO

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
HOW THEY LINE UP FOR THIS

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
OHH!

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
THEY CURED BREAST CANCER.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
AIN'T NO FRIENDS WHEN IT COMES
TO SLAVERY -- REAL OR MAKE

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
COME FIND ME, ROBERT.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS COUNTRY
WHEN TWO GROWN MEN CAN'T SETTLE

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I GAVE UP WORKING FOR NIGGAS,
AND OTHER COLORS, LIKE MEXICANS

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
COME HERE, NIGGER.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I'M SURE IT'LL CURE THIS.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
THAT'S HER AGAIN, DAMN IT!

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Granddad: OH, NO!

12:58.000 --> 12:58.000
3 MILLION PEOPLE...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
HEY, MAN...

12:58.000 --> 12:58.000
Granddad: NO!

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
BELIEVE.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
THEIR DIFFERENCES IN A BLOODY
STREET FIGHT?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Tom: YEAH, YOU WERE F'ed UP,
I KNOW.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
AND SAND PEOPLE.

12:59.000 --> 12:59.000
SHE CALLS ME...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
YOU WANT A CHANCE TO SHINE?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
NOW, SINCE I WAS CURSED WITH
REVITILIGO AND BORN IN THE 20th

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
NOW YOU BETTER GRAB SOME SUDS
AND START WAXING HOODS.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
JUST TO
SEE WHAT I'M DOING.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD COME IN
AND HAVE A CHAT.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
OKAY, SO, CHECK IT.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
WE'RE GONNA GET JUSTICE FOR YOUR
SISTER AND SHOW HOW MUCH WE

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
CENTURY, I NEVER GOT MY CHANCE
TO EXPERIENCE THE BEAUTY AND

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
WHICH ONE OF YOU TOOK IT?!

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
KEY WITH CHICKS IS TO INSULT
THEM WHEN YOU COMPLIMENT THEM.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
LORD, A HO CAN'T BE A
BLESSIN' IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
STOP PLAYING WITH ME!

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
WAX ON, WAX OFF, NIGGA!

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
WHICH ONE OF YOU TOOK IT?!

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Granddad: NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
CARE.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
MAGICAL NATURE KNOWN AS SLAVERY.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
GIVE IT TO ME!

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
THAT MONSTER IS NOT STEPPING ONE
FOOT IN MY HOUSE!

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
NEVER BE TOO NICE.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
LESSONS.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
NOW, FOLLOW ME, BENCH.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
GIVE IT TO ME NOW!

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
GRAB A COMPUTER.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
OH, BY THE WAY, IF ANYONE FROM

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
MAN, PLEASE, PLEASE, CAN WE KEEP

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
IT WAS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT
CINEMATIC CLASSIC "SPEED,"

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
SELLING MORE WOULD BE

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
THE BEST.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000

LAND!

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Granddad: NO, NOT THE PHONE.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
WHEN HE'S NOT WORKING OUT, THIS
IS ALL HE DOES.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
COUPLE OF DAYS?

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
Riley: HEY!

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYONE ELSE
TO CALL.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Granddad: SURE. ANYTHING.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
WOMEN THEY CAN'T HAVE LONG,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
SANDRA BULLOCK.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Ruckus: MR. WUNCLER, SIR,
NOW, I KNOW YOU SIMPLY WANTED ME

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
IT'S ALL A BUNCH OF

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
BEAUTIFUL HAIR.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
BUT IF WE DON'T GET RID OF
YOUR UGLY CLOTHES, WHERE WILL I

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I WANT YOU TO THINK OF MS. SIRI
AS YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
>> UNH-UNH.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
"IF YOU STOP THE BUS, THE
BOMB WILL NOT EXPLODE.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
EH, NO SWEAT, MAN.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
OR BLACK MEN, EITHER.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
TO BRING HIM HERE TO THIS
MEETING, BUT JUST WHISTLE, AND I

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Riley: SHE'S...AN...APP!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
ANYWAY.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
THAT WAS ROUGH.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
>> Granddad: SO, YOU DON'T CARE

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
PUT MY CLOTHES?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Granddad: NO, SHE'S THE
DIGITAL FEMALE CONSCIOUSNESS

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
LIARS.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Tom: YEAH, IT WAS A DISASTER.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
THAT IT'S ILLEGAL?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Granddad: IN YOUR HOUSE!

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
IF ANYONE LEAVES THE BUS, THE
BOMB WILL NOT EXPLODE."

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
LOOKING OUT FOR OTHERS.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
WILL BE ON HIM LIKE WHITE ON
RICE!

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
SO MUCH FOR MAKING A MAN OUT
OF ME.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
SO, WE JUST CAME BY BECAUSE
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE'VE RENTED

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
YOU KNOW I SOLD MY HOUSE TO
PAY FOR YOU.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
THE PRESIDENT IS A LIAR.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
>> JUST BETWEEN US, MY BUSINESS

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I GUESS IT ALL STARTED WHEN I
WAS A NURSE IN THE WAR.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
THAT RESIDES IN THE PHONE, AND
SHE'S JUST AS REAL AS YOU OR I.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Tom: I THINK THERE MAY BE A
PROBLEM.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
NAW, MAN.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Ruckus: "AND IF YOU TURN THAT
BUS AROUND AND LEAVE DECENT

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Huey: NOT FOR LONG.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
TO JUST STAND UP AND WALK OUT,
THAT TOOK GUTS.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
ALL THE ROOMS IN YOUR HOUSE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
ISN'T ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Granddad: DAMN!

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
DEFIANT. I LIKES.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Granddad: ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU
THINK I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
YOU SEE, BOYS, IN MANY WAYS,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Tom: ALL I ENDED UP LEARNING
IS MY WIFE LIKES YOU BETTER.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
BAD NEWS IS, WE'RE STILL NOT
REALLY MAKIN' A DENT IN YOUR

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
>> Granddad: NO!

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
WHITE FOLKS ALONE, THEN THE BOMB
WILL NOT EXPLODE."

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
I USED MY PANTYHOSE AS
TOURNIQUETS FOR THE TROOPS.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
BUT PERHAPS YOUR ILL FEELINGS
ARE MISPLACED, LITTLE ANGRY AFRO

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I'M SUPERIOR TO A REAL-LIFE STEP-GRANDMOTHER.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
HI, MR. FREEMAN.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
DEBT.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
>> Huey: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Huey: HOW?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
PROMISED HER MORE, GRANDDAD.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
ROBERT?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE ME
BETTER.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
THERE IS NO WAY I'M MAKING MORE.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
HUH.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Huey: LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE LIVED
A FULL LIFE.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.000
BOY?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
YOUR GRANDFATHER?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Granddad: WELL, SHE'S LIGHTER
AND THINNER THAN A REAL

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH JUST BORING
AS

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I'LL JUST PUT THIS IN THAT NICE,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
>> Granddad: FINE.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
IF YOU ASK ME, I THINK THAT WAS
PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
WE'LL MAKE IT.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
SHE USED REAL SWEET POTATOES.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
OH, I HAVE.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
ALREADY SLAVES IN DEBT TO ME
BEFORE THEY BECAME SLAVES HERE.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
GRANDMOTHER, AND YOU KNOW HOW
REAL WOMEN CAN PUT ON WEIGHT,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
YOU'RE ROLLING WITH ME TONIGHT.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
>> Riley: YEAH, YEAH.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
HA! THOSE MEDALS -- EVEN GOT ONE
FROM THE VICE PRESIDENTE AFTER

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
WE'LL MAKE IT, NIGGA.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
OH, MY GOODNESS.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I'M TAKING YOU TO MAN CAMP.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
YOU THINK YOU THE ONLY ONE IN

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
AND SHE'S GREAT WITH DIRECTIONS.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
BUT I DON'T HANG WITH NO
NEGATIVE-ENERGY-SUCKING

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
COOL CORNER.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
THIS HOUSE WHO KNOWS CHEMISTRY?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
OKAY. INSTRUCT ME ON WHAT YOU
EXPECT AT NIGHT -- TELL YOU

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
THERE ARE JUST SO MANY THINGS.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
UNH! HEY!

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Granddad: UH...

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
>> Huey: OBVIOUSLY.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
WORLD WAR II.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
AND HEY, YOUR SCOWL -- NOT
HELPING.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
I INVITE YOU TO BROWSE THE APP
STORE TO SEE ALL THE AMAZING

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Granddad: DAMN IT, WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING, BITCH!

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
SO GATHER UP SOME
POSITIVITY IN THIS BITCH RIGHT

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
>> Granddad: OKAY. WELL, UH-HUH.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
IS WRONG WITH
YOU?!

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
SURE. Y-YEAH.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
YOU LOOK BETTER WITHOUT MAKEUP,
A COUPLE OF "I'LL KILL MYSELF IF

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
YEP, HE GAVE ME A MEDAL AND SOME
SMOKES.

16:29.000 --> 16:29.000
I GOT A LITTLE OF THE STUFF

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
THINGS SHE CAN DO.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I OUGHT TO WHUP YOUR BIG
ASS!

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
QUICK AND LET'S ROLL OUT.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
LEFT.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Huey: HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH
YOURSELF?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, CAN I TALK TO
YOU IN PRIVATE?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
OUT OF MY
WAY!

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Tom: OKAY! I CAN BE POSITIVE.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I CAN SEND IT TO A LAB. YEAH.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
SORRY, THERE, FREEDOM
FELLERS -- TIME AND A HALF JUST

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF HE'D
VISITED ME WHEN I HAD EMPHYSEMA.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES IT TAKE FOR
SOMEONE TO LOSE THEIR

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
THAT ALWAYS WORKS ON TV.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
YOU LEAVE ME"?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Granddad: OF COURSE NOT,
GRANDSON.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Riley: SLOW DOWN, GRANDDAD!

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'M NOT A LOSER.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'LL GET IT ANALYZED.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
YOU'RE JUST SILLY-ACTING.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
CONSCIENCE?

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
I CAN...GET STUFF...HAPPENING,
AND I GOT STUFF GOING ON!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
SO, Y'ALL HAD ANY LUCK WITH
THE MONEY?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I'LL MAKE IT MYSELF.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
AIN'T WORTH IT.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
Huey: WELL, WHO DO YOU

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
NO GUILT, NO SHAME.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME, YOU
CAN SAY IN FRONT OF MS. SIRI.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, WATCH OUT FOR
THAT CURB!

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Granddad: WHEN DID THEY START

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Granddad: WELL, IT'S BEEN
REAL -- HOPE YOU REACH THE

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
JUST GREED.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Riley: OW!

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
MAYBE...MILLION, AT LEAST?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
I CAN'T FIND MY SEAT BELT!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
>> Riley: ANALYZED, NIGGA.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
PROMISED LAND.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
DAMN. YOU'RE A DOWNER.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
YES, HUEY. WE ARE A FAMILY.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Huey: WHOA, HEY, GRANDDAD, I

16:38.000 --> 16:38.000

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Granddad: EDDIE, I'M SORRY.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
KNOCKING?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
THE STRUGGLE NEEDS YOU,
ROBERT.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
YOU SHOULD TRY TRANSCENDENTAL
MEDITATION OR -- ANYWAY, LOOK,

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I TAUGHT THEM.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Granddad: NIGGA, IF YOU DON'T
GET OUT OF MY WAY --

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SECRETS.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT YOUR
EYESIGHT AND WHETHER IT'S SAFE

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
THINGS COULD BE WORSE.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
IT'S GOOD MANNERS.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
USUALLY TALK TO?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
WHAT IS IT?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I COULD BE THAT GUY.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
DON'T YOU HAVE VISITORS?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000

SLEEP.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I'M MOSTLY INDIAN ON MY MAMA
SIDE, ANYWAY.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
EH, NO ONE CARES ABOUT AN OLD
BROKE LADY.

STOP BEING ALL "FREEDOM FIGHTER"
AND I'LL GIVE YOUR GRANDFATHER A

Huey: ...HOLDING YOU HOSTAGE
WITH YOUR HIJACKED IDENTITY

16:44.000 --> 16:44.000
IT'S A MIRROR, TOM.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Riley: I'M JUST READING.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW TO SEE

RICH ENOUGH TO RENT GRANDDAD.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Granddad: YOU KNOW THAT'S
KIDNAPPING, RIGHT?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
YOU KNOW, ONE WHERE HE HAS NO
REAL POWER, BUT YOUR PEOPLE ARE

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
>> Granddad: WUNCLER OWNS THIS

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE POLICE
ON HIS ASS.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000

FLOOR LOCKED DOWN.

BUT I WAS LIKE, "LET ME?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000

I'M A GROWN-ASS MAN.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Huey: I'M GONNA HAVE TO PASS.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
THAT COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM
THE TRUTH.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
THIS MAN IS A CUSTOMER.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I AIN'T HUNGRY NOW.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
HE IS A WAR HERO -- A
CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND!

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
>> Riley: YOUR CALL, NIGGA.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
WHOO!

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
AH, BUT I FORGIVE HER AND ALL
THE PEOPLE AROUND HER.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
HE'S VERY HAPPY.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR
SPACE!

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN A BEATING
AND A HALF.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
HIS SOUL?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I ASSURE YOU.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
RUCKUS!

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
WE MUST FIND A WAY TO HELP HIM!

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
BOYS, THERE'S GREAT POWER IN
FORGIVENESS, SELF-SACRIFICE, AND

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Ruckus: HOW DARE YOU GO
DARKENING MR. WUNCLER'S THOUGHTS

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
THAT IS SWEAT OF JOY.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I DIDN'T BEAT HIM.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
NO!

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Huey: OKAY, GRANDDAD, THIS
HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
THAT'S OUR SPACE, GOD DAMN IT!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
MY INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
WE SISTERS HAVE OUR WAYS.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
NO! I WANT OFF THE BUS!

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Riley: I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
WELL, THERE IS ONE WAY.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
WITH YOUR NIGGA LOGIC!

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
OKAY, I  THREATENED  TO BEAT

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
WELCOME.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
THINKING OF YOURSELF LAST.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Ruckus: UH, DID YOU WANT THE
DOOR OPEN?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Riley: YEAH, GRANDDAD.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I SEE YOU.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000

DAMAGED CREDIT.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
WE NEED TO SET UP SOMEWHERE

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
SIGHT THAT COULD BE USED TO BEAT

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
ROAD, AND THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN
WAVING US DOWN.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000

Tom: TYLENOL?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Granddad: IT MEANS NOW I'M

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Huey: IT'S "HANGIN' IN THE
CHOW LINE," GRANDDAD.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
BOSS WILLONA.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Granddad: WELL, BOYS, THIS IS

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
SIMMER DOWN. SIMMER DOWN.

18:13.000 --> 18:13.000
ROBERT?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Granddad: SIRI, BABY, I'M
SORRY.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
STINKMEANER!

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
I PROMISE YOU, I'M WORTH BEING
BITCH-SLAPPED FOR.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
SPENDING ON AN OLD MAN?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
THERE'LL BE ENOUGH FOR
EVERYBODY.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
KILL THEM! YEAH!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
CAN YOU THROW ME A LINE?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Granddad: I DIDN'T!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
REVERSE HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
TRYING TO GET MY UNION CARD.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
SHE'S RIGHT.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Ruckus: OH, IT JUST AIN'T
NATURAL, ROBERT.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
THIS NIGGA AIN'T GIVIN' IN.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
IS THAT WHAT I AM TO YOU --

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
FIND ANYTHING, COLUMBO?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
IF WE STOP NOW, THEN THOSE WHO
WOULD OPPRESS US SHALL KNOW THAT

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
SO IT'S ANOTHER STEP UP THE
HUMILIATION LADDER -- TAR AND

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
SOME MACHINE YOU CAN JUST TURN OFF?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
WE LOVE YOU!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
IT AIN'T NATURAL.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
WE LOVE YOU!

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'M STARTING TO FEEL UNAPPRECIATED, ROBERT.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Tom: UH, NOPE!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
>> SO, THIS IS WHERE YOU MAKE

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
BATS, BOMBS, AND GUNS ARE ALL
THEY NEED TO SCARE US.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
STRONG HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
NOTHING.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
FEATHERING!

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE I SHOULD TELL THE WORLD WHAT A

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
HOLD IT.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
NOBODY WILL EVER FIND THIS.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
NO.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Granddad: THAT'S ALL THEY
NEED TO SCARE  ME!

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
WHITE WOMEN'S JOB IS TO MAKE
SAMMICHES AND LOOK PRETTY.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000

WE'LL LET YOU OUT OF YOUR

PERHAPS YOU CAN TAKE THEM TO GET
HELP.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000

CONTROLLING THE PURSE STRINGS,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
WE'LL GET ONE FOR YOU.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
SORRY, I WAS JUST CUTTIN' SOME,
UH, MEAT EARLIER.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Granddad: I THOUGHT WE -- I
JUST GOT MY ASS KICKED FOR YOU!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
GOD BLESS YOU, SON.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
THE LOWER CLASS ARE HERE!

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
HAVE THE INTELLECT AND
SILKY-SMOOTH VOICE OF A

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
AGH!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
WHAT'S UP, TIGER?

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Huey: WE HAVE TO STOP IT!

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Tom: YOU FAKED THE ROBBERY.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Granddad: I'VE DONE MY PART!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I'M KIDDING!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
OF LIFE.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
YEAH, BOY!

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Tom: I WATCHED THE
SURVEILLANCE TAPE, FLIZZY -- THE

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
THEY KNOW WE'RE A COUPLE.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
IF THAT BUS CROSSES THIS LINE, IT SETS OFF A SERIES OF

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
CAUCASIAN WOMAN.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
THIS PLACE, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
BUT THE PART ABOUT THEM BEING
LONELY AND BITTER -- TRUE.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Huey: LET'S GO, RILEY.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
UHHH...

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
HOWEVER, I HAD TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THAT SIRI DOES NOT

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Riley: NO, WE DON'T.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
WHOLE  TAPE.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
>> Granddad: LET ME SEE.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Riley: I KNOW. DAMN.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
AGH!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I KNOW YOU STAGED THE ROBBERY.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
GUYS.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
ISN'T THERE ANYONE WHO CAN HELP
THIS MAN?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
OH, YOU'RE JUST AS HANDSOME
AS VANESSA SAID.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
SHE GOT A NIGGA FEELING ALL
UNHUNGRY AND EMOTIONAL.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
HAVE AN ACTUAL CAUCASIAN WOMAN'S
VAGINAL REGION FOR ROBERT THE

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
YOU JUST COULDN'T LEAVE
ALONE, COULD YOU?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE POUR.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
FIRST, THERE WILL BE INTEGRATED DINERS AND BATHROOMS AND THEN

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Ruckus: YES, SIR, MR. KINDLY
BILLIONAIRE WHITE MAN.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
AND YOUR GRANDKIDS ARE SO
WELL-MANNERED.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Tom: WHAT ELSE WAS FAKE?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
THEN A PINCH AND A SPLASH.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Granddad: COME ON, SQUEEZE MY
HAND, BABY.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
OHH! AGH!

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
SCHOOLS.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WERE THE NICARAGUAN GUNS FAKE?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
OR IS IT A SPLASH, THEN A PINCH

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WHERE THEIR DADDY AT?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
LET ME KNOW YOU'RE STILL THERE.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
NEGRO TO PENETRATE OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
AGH!

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
DID YOU REALLY EVEN BEAT
CHRISTIANNA?

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
UNCLE RUCKUS CAN HELP YOU WITH
THAT BROKE NIGGA.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I BET THAT NO-GOOD NIGGER
DROPPED THEM OFF WITH YOU AND

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
THERE WILL BE NIGGER QUARTERBACKS, NIGGERS WINNING

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
OKAY, DON'T SQUEEZE MY HAND IF
YOU WANT ME TO BE THE SOLE

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
WHAT KIND OF

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
DON'T YOU  EVER  QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT I BEAT

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
AND A POUR?

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
ACADEMY AWARDS, NIGGERS PLAYING DOCTORS ON TELEVISION, AND

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
NEVER LOOKED BACK, RIGHT?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
BENEFICIARY IN YOUR WILL.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
HIS TWISTED NEGRO PENIS.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
CHRISTIANNA!

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
>> Huey: WRONG ONE.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Riley: ALSO, WE OF THE

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I WHUPPED THAT BITCH'S ASS!

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
WE GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY
PRAYING WE FIND A MAN LIKE YOU.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
EVENTUALLY, EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE WON'T BE WHITE.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
SHE DIDN'T SQUEEZE.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
AGH! UH, ALL RIGHT, ROBERT.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
LOOK, IT'S FORMER
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
YOU GOT THAT?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
GET BACK!

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
BUT THE NICKI MINAJ THING WAS
STAGED.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
COME ON, MAN.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
TEA PARTY ARE STRICT BELIEVERS
IN PERSONAL FREEDOM -- AS LONG

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
>> Granddad: AAH!

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I'M NOT SURE WHY WE KEEP
GOING.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
WHITE MEN, YOU MUST STOP THIS BUS!

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
HAVE SOME DIGNITY.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
GET BACK WHERE YOU BELONG!

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
NEXT MAYOR OF WOODCREST,
UNCLE RUCKUS!

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
LET'S JUST PULL THE PLUG.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
SHE AIN'T REALLY A CYBORG,
EITHER.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
ONLY GOOD MAN IN THERE IS JESUS.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
THIS GRAVY TRAIN IS A WRAP FOR
ALL OF US.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
AS THAT PERSONAL FREEDOM DOES
NOT INVOLVE MAN ON MAN

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
SHE'S A NICE GIRL.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Ruckus: OH, THE FREAKNIK
CIRCUS HAS COME TO TOWN IN

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
You get in there and you do the
thing I'm talkin' about.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Granddad: WE'RE NOT PULLING
THE PLUG UNTIL YOU RECOGNIZE

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
DAMN, TOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST MIND YOUR
OWN BUSINESS?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Ruckus: Yeah, the only thing
they understand.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
ROBERT FREEMAN'S LIVING ROOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
GOOD.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
OR SMOKING OF REEFER.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Tom: I'M YOUR ATTORNEY!

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
GIRLS, THAT'S RUCKUS.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
NOW SCRAM BEFORE SOMEONE SHOOTS
YOUR BLACK ASS BY MISTAKE.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
THAT NON-SQUEEZE.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
THEREFORE, I DECIDED IT WAS OKAY
TO DO THIS FAVOR FOR MY POOR,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Ruckus:

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
JUST PULL THE DAMN PLUG.

19:38.000 --> 19:38.000
THIS  IS  MY BUSINESS!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
IF SHE LIVES, SHE'LL BE
DEFORMED.

19:39.000 --> 19:39.000
BUT WHY?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
HE IS CRAZY!

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Ruckus: OH, OH, YES, SIR,
MR. BULL, SIR.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
'CAUSE I GOT TO STAY
RELEVANT! THAT'S WHY!

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
BUT IF HE'S ROBERT'S FRIEND,
THEN HE'S MY FRIEND, TOO.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
LIFE IS
THAT?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
SUCKS RIGHT
NOW!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
>> Granddad: RILEY!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
LONELY, DERANGED FORMER
EMPLOYER.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Granddad: DAMN IT!

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT YOU NOW.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Granddad:

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Granddad: SLAVERY?!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Granddad: OKAY, THAT'S
ENOUGH.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
YOU GOT TO ACT LIKE AN IDIOT
JUST TO STAY IN THEIR

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
OH, THERE'S MY AFRICAN
PRINCE!

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
TURN BACK.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
GET ON WITH IT.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Riley: OKAY, FINE, NIGGA,
FINE.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
FACES!

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Ruckus: THAT'S RIGHT -- I

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
BUT IF I CAN STAY IN JUST THE
RIGHT AMOUNT OF TROUBLE, I'LL BE

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS
"SLAVERY."

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I GOT TO TAKE MY TIME.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
PLEASE.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
MY LADY IS NOT DYING UNTIL WE'VE
HAD A REAL BENEFITS TALK UP IN

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
NOW, IF ANYBODY OUT THERE HAS
ANY REASON THAT THIS NIGGA

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Huey: HEY, STOP THIS!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I THINK ABOUT IT AS INVESTING IN
PEOPLE.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
DIDN'T FORGET YOUR REQUEST.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
GRANDDAD, STOP!

19:50.000 --> 19:50.000
ALL RIGHT.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
THE MOST POWERFUL
BLACK-BITCH-BEGONE EVER -- A

Ruckus: OH! DID I HEAR A
NIGGA RAISING HIS VOICE IN THE

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKES!

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
SHOULD NOT MARRY HIS TELEPHONE,
WHICH SHOULD BE EVERYBODY, SPEAK

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
AND WOMEN HATE TO BE BORED.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Huey: HELP YOU DO WHAT?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
WE CAN LEARN!

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Riley: YEAH, WHAT WE GOT TO
DO IN RETURN?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
WE'RE NOT NIGGAS, GRANDDAD!

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Tom: LOOK, FLIZZY, I'M SORRY.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
FAULT, GRANDDAD.

AAH! NO! AAH!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
OKAY, NIGGA, THAT'S IT!

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
IT BETTER NOT BE NOTHIN' GAY.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Granddad: NO! MAKE HER LEAVE!

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
YOUR GOVERNMENT BENEFITS HAVE
EXPIRED!

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
IF WE DIE, I AIN'T NEVER GONNA

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
NOW OR FOREVER HOLD THY PEACE.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
NO.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
FORGIVE YOU.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR WORLD.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
IT JUST MEANS YOU GET TO LIVE IN
100% OF THE HOUSE 100% OF THE

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Ruckus: THAT AIN'T POSSIBLE.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
COME WITH ME.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I'M A SIMPLE GUY.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
WHITE WOMEN ARE LOYAL -- FOR
REAL.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Granddad: IF YOU DON'T GET
YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF OF ME --

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Riley: NOW, AT THIS TIME,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I JUST WANT TO DO MY JOB, TAKE
CARE OF MY FAMILY, AND I NEEDED

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
TRY TO KICK HER.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Huey: HEY, GUYS!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
TIME, AND, IN EXCHANGE...

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
DID YOU KNOW THERE'S A REALLY
IMPORTANT LADY OUT THERE WHO'S

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000

20:04.000 --> 20:04.000
AAH!

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
SHE'LL JUST LOVE YOU MORE.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
SIRI HAS SOME WORDS SHE WANTED
TO SHARE WITH ROBERT.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
NO, I JUST OWN 100% OF YOUR
TIME UNTIL THE DEBT IS PAID.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Granddad: PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
REALLY SICK?

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000

BE STRONG.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
SIRI?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
WOW, THIS IS BORING.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
ROBERT, OUR LOVE TRANSCENDS

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
OH, YOU WANT YOUR WIFE BACK?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
THAT'S FAIR, RIGHT?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
GOD WILL PROTECT US.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
HOW ABOUT NOT INVITING A NIGGA
THAT'S RICHER THAN YOU AND

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Huey: NO!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
SOMETHING.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Granddad: OH, SHUT THE
UP!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I'LL GO SEE IF SHE'S HOT.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
THESE WORTHLESS PHYSICAL SHELLS THAT TRAP US.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
SURE, IT IS.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Granddad: THIS IS ALL A
STUPID MISTAKE.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY I COME BY
UNANNOUNCED, IN THE MIDDLE OF

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
AAH!

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
PRETTIER THAN YOU TO MEET YOUR
WIFE?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
PLEASE!

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER -- TO

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I INVESTED ALL MY
MONEY IN YOU.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I MEAN, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE,
NIGGA?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
THE NIGHT, AND I NEED YOU TO
LEND A HAND...I DON'T KNOW,

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
TRULY BE TOGETHER -- WE SHOULD SHED OUR PHYSICAL BEINGS.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Tom: WHAT?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
WASHING MY SPACESHIP, OR, SAY,
DIGGING A SIX-FOOT HOLE IN THE

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
BUT I-I THOUGHT WE WERE --
THOUGHT WHAT, NIGGA?!

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Granddad: IF I LET YOU LIVE,
YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE ME ALONE,

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
COME ON, GIRL.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I'M GOING NORTH!

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Granddad: I HEAR THE SAD-SONG
CUE.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Granddad: SHED WHAT?
