01:02.829 --> 01:04.763
Not bad.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.495
But not good enough to live.

01:20.113 --> 01:24.413
Mind if I sit down?
I don't have your energy.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.749
Fight with your head.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.615
Not your heart.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.605
Straight.

01:46.639 --> 01:49.107
Better, Einon.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.975
But you're still dead.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.219
Purpose, not passion.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.890
No one ever found victory
in the dirt.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.796
The peasants are revolting.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.172
They've always been revoltin', Prince.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.506
But now they're rebellin'.

02:25.578 --> 02:29.173
King Freyne wants his son
to witness his noble victory.

02:29.249 --> 02:32.810
There's nothing noble
about crushing desperate men.

02:32.852 --> 02:34.820
They're traitorous scum!

02:34.854 --> 02:37.118
The king commands!
Bring him!

02:41.461 --> 02:44.624
You can come, too, nursemaid.

03:48.928 --> 03:51.761
Die, you dog!

04:02.775 --> 04:05.938
- I wish we were down there.
- No, you don't.

04:06.045 --> 04:08.445
Yes, I do. Just to see you
in action, Bowen.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.108
Yours would be
the finest blade on the field.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.119
My blade was not made
for your father's slaughter.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.281
He is my father, Bowen,
and he is the king.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.291
Yes.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.759
But when you are king,
remember today...

04:21.793 --> 04:24.627
and the difference
between battle and butchery.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.926
And remember the Old Code.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.127
Then you'll be a greater king
than your father.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.301
I promise, Knight...

04:34.407 --> 04:36.932
I will be greater.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.508
Freyne!

05:16.582 --> 05:20.018
Now, Hewe, now!

05:32.532 --> 05:35.365
- He's trapped!
- Einon!

05:35.435 --> 05:37.369
Einon!

05:46.679 --> 05:49.546
Einon, no!

06:03.830 --> 06:05.730
Enough! Enough!

06:05.832 --> 06:08.130
The battle's out there!

06:29.222 --> 06:31.417
Father?

06:45.605 --> 06:48.369
Die! It's mine!

07:36.656 --> 07:39.284
Einon! Einon!

07:40.893 --> 07:42.986
I'm here, Einon!

07:43.095 --> 07:45.962
I'm here, my King.

08:16.361 --> 08:18.329
Dead, madam.

08:18.363 --> 08:22.663
King Freyne,
your husband, slain.

08:25.870 --> 08:27.861
In here!

08:30.542 --> 08:33.669
In here, on the bed.

08:38.783 --> 08:41.683
Get out! Out!
Out! Brok, out!

08:43.321 --> 08:45.380
You stay, Bowen.

08:50.362 --> 08:53.160
Forgive me, Queen Aislinn.

08:54.699 --> 08:57.167
There's nothing to forgive.

08:57.235 --> 08:59.863
His father's tyranny
brought him to this end.

09:03.008 --> 09:05.408
He's beyond all help.

09:14.886 --> 09:16.820
Not all.

09:21.893 --> 09:23.918
A knight is sworn to valor.

09:24.029 --> 09:26.259
Sworn to valor.

09:26.331 --> 09:28.765
- His heart knows only virtue.
- Virtue.

09:28.867 --> 09:32.928
His blade defends the helpless.

09:33.004 --> 09:35.063
His might upholds the weak.

09:37.275 --> 09:39.505
You must stay awake, my son!

09:39.577 --> 09:42.011
- You must stay awake. Repeat the Code.
- The Code.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.071
His might upholds the weak.

09:44.115 --> 09:47.346
H-His word speaks only truth.

09:47.419 --> 09:49.353
His wrath--

09:49.421 --> 09:51.446
Undoes the wicked.

10:03.234 --> 10:05.566
Brok, stay there.

10:14.245 --> 10:17.612
Lord! Great one!

10:21.219 --> 10:23.813
Your song is sad!

10:23.922 --> 10:26.550
Are the stars shining tonight?

10:26.624 --> 10:30.492
No. No bright souls
glitter in this darkness.

10:37.736 --> 10:40.500
Leave us. Go.

10:42.107 --> 10:44.575
Aislinn, daughter of the Celts.

10:44.642 --> 10:48.169
Whose people loved your kind
and called you friend.

10:48.246 --> 10:51.181
Ah, the king's son...

10:51.282 --> 10:53.682
cruel and full of trickery.

10:53.785 --> 10:57.778
- Is this why you've come,
dragonslayer's wife?
- Dragonslayer's widow!

10:59.157 --> 11:02.649
This boy is not his father.

11:02.694 --> 11:05.925
This knight here is his mentor.
He has taught him the Old Code.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.700
I need your help.

11:23.148 --> 11:25.309
The wound is deep.

11:25.383 --> 11:27.943
You know what you ask.

11:28.019 --> 11:30.613
I will teach him your ways.

11:30.688 --> 11:33.782
He will grow in your grace.
He will grow just and good.

11:33.858 --> 11:35.792
I swear.

11:35.860 --> 11:40.058
No! The boy must swear.
Give me your sword, Knight.

11:40.131 --> 11:42.065
Your sword!

11:49.340 --> 11:52.741
Do not be afraid.
He can save you.

11:52.811 --> 11:54.745
Now listen to me, boy.

11:54.813 --> 11:58.544
Swear that your father's
blood lust and tyranny died with him.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.746
Swear that you will live
and rule with mercy.

12:01.820 --> 12:04.254
Come to me
and learn the Once-ways.

12:04.322 --> 12:06.256
Now swear!

12:06.324 --> 12:08.690
I swear.

12:20.572 --> 12:22.506
He's dead!

12:23.942 --> 12:27.275
Peace, Knight of the Old Code.

12:27.345 --> 12:30.280
Witness the wonders
of an ancient glory.

13:22.267 --> 13:24.792
Half my heart
to make you whole.

13:24.836 --> 13:27.999
Its strength
to purify your weakness.

13:28.106 --> 13:31.473
Live, and remember your oath.

14:07.278 --> 14:11.374
I served the father only
for the sake of the son.

14:11.449 --> 14:14.282
All my hopes rest on him.

14:14.352 --> 14:16.843
Forgive a doubting fool.

14:16.888 --> 14:21.052
Call when you need of me.
Ask what you will of me.

14:21.159 --> 14:25.289
My sword, my service are yours.

14:25.363 --> 14:28.992
Only remind him
always of his vow...

14:29.067 --> 14:32.059
Knight of the Old Code.

14:44.716 --> 14:46.650
Brok.

14:47.418 --> 14:49.545
Your Majesty?

14:49.587 --> 14:52.750
The Romans built
this great fortress.

14:52.824 --> 14:56.316
I will rebuild it,
and mine will be greater.

14:58.363 --> 15:01.526
It will take many men, my Lord,
to rebuild this ruin.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.426
Yes.

15:04.502 --> 15:06.766
Yes, it will.

15:37.969 --> 15:39.869
Not so rebellious now.

15:39.937 --> 15:44.033
You should thank me, boy.
It was my stroke made you king.

15:45.943 --> 15:49.640
No, Brok, I want no martyrs.

15:49.714 --> 15:52.080
Death should be a release,
not a punishment.

15:55.053 --> 15:56.987
Look good, dog.

15:57.055 --> 15:59.148
I'm the last thing
you'll ever see.

16:00.658 --> 16:02.558
Burn the insolence
out of his eyes.

16:04.095 --> 16:07.223
No! No!
Not my eyes! No!

16:07.298 --> 16:09.630
Father!

16:10.501 --> 16:12.435
Run!

16:20.278 --> 16:22.678
How dare you defy me!

16:22.780 --> 16:26.341
Einon, you're unwell.
You've been bewitched.

16:26.417 --> 16:28.681
Look at this!
It's madness!

16:30.021 --> 16:32.421
- Remember the Code!
- The king is above the Code!

16:35.426 --> 16:37.860
Have you forgotten
everything I taught you?

16:37.929 --> 16:41.695
No one is above the Code...

16:41.799 --> 16:44.529
especially the king.

17:05.656 --> 17:09.057
Dragon, I loved that boy,
and you changed him!

17:09.160 --> 17:11.390
You tricked me, Dragon!

17:11.462 --> 17:14.625
No matter where you fly...

17:14.699 --> 17:17.896
no matter where you go,
I will find you!

17:19.036 --> 17:21.903
Today I make a new vow!

17:21.973 --> 17:26.410
I will spend the rest of my life
hunting you down!

17:31.082 --> 17:33.983
Avalon, oh, Avalon.

17:34.051 --> 17:36.713
For you I quest each day...

17:36.754 --> 17:39.222
the resting place of Arthur...

17:39.256 --> 17:42.384
and the Old Code of his way.

17:42.426 --> 17:45.418
And when I find
those holy stones...

17:45.496 --> 17:49.262
I'll pray, I'll pray, I'll pray.

17:49.367 --> 17:52.234
Oh, Avalon, bright Avalon...

17:52.269 --> 17:55.102
think me not a fool.

17:55.172 --> 18:00.075
My quest is not for vanity,
my quest is spiritual.

18:00.111 --> 18:02.272
Spiritual!

18:02.346 --> 18:05.577
Merlin, spiritual!

18:05.616 --> 18:08.016
Whoa! Merlin!

18:08.085 --> 18:10.019
Merlin! Ow!

18:14.759 --> 18:17.125
Everyone's a critic!

18:38.983 --> 18:41.645
- Dragon, dragon.
- Yes, I know. Where?

18:41.719 --> 18:44.313
There, there.

19:18.422 --> 19:21.482
Get back here, horse.
You coward.

19:25.529 --> 19:30.023
Marvelous! Heroics befitting the days
of Arthur and the Round Table!

19:30.134 --> 19:32.261
Never have I seen such skill!

19:32.336 --> 19:35.362
Then you must have lived
the sheltered life...

19:35.439 --> 19:37.532
of a mon-- monk.

19:37.641 --> 19:41.372
Why, yes. A scribe, scholar,
historian and poet.

19:41.479 --> 19:44.380
Your servant, sir,
Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur.

19:44.448 --> 19:47.940
My humble life is in debt
to your exalted prowess...

19:48.018 --> 19:51.715
your dauntless courage,
and your superb, swift sword.

19:51.822 --> 19:53.881
You have the poet's gift
of exaggeration.

19:53.958 --> 19:56.119
Sir, you should read
my histories.

19:56.193 --> 20:00.061
But you belittle your talent.
Modesty as well as valor.

20:00.164 --> 20:02.860
The Code of ancient Camelot
still lives.

20:02.900 --> 20:07.337
Hardly worthy of Camelot.
Still, it's one less dragon.

20:10.674 --> 20:13.006
Well done, Knight!
Congratulations.

20:13.077 --> 20:15.307
Our gratitude,
mine and King Einon's.

20:15.379 --> 20:18.576
Uh, you can keep your gratitude.
I'll take the gold.

20:18.682 --> 20:21.048
- Yours or the king's.
- Gold, Knight?

20:21.085 --> 20:24.577
We made a bargain, remember?
One dragon put down, one bag of gold.

20:24.688 --> 20:27.384
Your honor has a price,
Sir Knight?

20:27.424 --> 20:29.756
It has expenses.

20:29.860 --> 20:32.420
Honor won't feed my belly
nor shoe my horse.

20:32.496 --> 20:34.555
The priest is right.

20:34.598 --> 20:38.557
It is your duty to protect King Einon's
vassals as a knight of the realm.

20:38.602 --> 20:41.366
Not of this realm.
I bend no knee to Einon.

20:42.773 --> 20:45.606
I should have known.
Foreign riffraff!

20:45.676 --> 20:48.372
Well, begone, vagabond,
before I arrest you!

20:49.847 --> 20:51.781
Back to work, you scum!

20:51.882 --> 20:55.045
If King Einon's wheat
isn't cut before the rain...

20:55.119 --> 20:57.553
I'll do a little cutting
of my own!

20:58.522 --> 21:00.717
Sir Knight!
Sir Knight, wait!

21:02.393 --> 21:04.020
Sir Knight!

21:04.094 --> 21:06.119
Hear me out!

21:06.197 --> 21:08.757
I'm on a pilgrimage.
Might we travel together?

21:08.799 --> 21:12.098
The road's still free,
unless Einon's taxed it.

21:21.979 --> 21:25.710
A road tax, King Einon. Hmm?

21:25.783 --> 21:28.308
A road tax.

21:29.486 --> 21:31.454
They are your roads, after all.

21:31.488 --> 21:33.956
People really ought to pay
for the privilege of using them.

21:33.991 --> 21:37.119
- And those that can't pay
will have to work it off.
- lngenious, Felton.

21:37.161 --> 21:39.959
Only you could keep such a good brain
under such a bad hat.

21:39.997 --> 21:43.160
That's very good, "bad hat."

21:43.234 --> 21:45.498
Out of my way, peacock.

21:45.569 --> 21:48.629
Brok, some are good at hunting men,
some are good at hunting money.

21:48.672 --> 21:51.402
Both have value for me.

22:55.139 --> 22:57.073
Kara?

22:59.243 --> 23:02.212
Kara, I told you--

23:02.246 --> 23:05.807
- I told you not to come here anymore.
- I'm a disobedient child.

23:06.850 --> 23:10.308
Go on. Take a drink. Go on.

23:11.488 --> 23:13.581
Magnificent shot, Your Highness!

23:13.691 --> 23:16.922
- Care to double the wager?
- Ah, yes, happily.

23:16.994 --> 23:18.985
Shall we say the water bucket?

23:19.063 --> 23:21.361
Stand still. Stand still.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.094
Superb!

23:26.203 --> 23:28.103
Double again?

23:28.205 --> 23:31.003
Double again. Why not?

23:32.943 --> 23:35.241
I say.

23:35.279 --> 23:37.270
A moving target.

23:37.381 --> 23:39.440
Peasant scum.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.854
You've got a nerve,
interfering with the king's sport!

23:48.926 --> 23:51.622
There's no sport
in tormenting a sick, old man.

23:53.297 --> 23:56.789
I beg Your Majesty,
let him go.

23:56.867 --> 24:00.359
It's been 12 years.
Your castle is built.

24:01.638 --> 24:03.902
He can do you no more harm.

24:05.743 --> 24:08.303
For God's sake, release him.

24:13.984 --> 24:16.475
Father!

24:16.587 --> 24:19.215
I've always said death is a release,
not a punishment.

24:19.289 --> 24:21.814
Go.

24:27.064 --> 24:28.998
Kara.

25:14.010 --> 25:17.036
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!

25:17.113 --> 25:20.708
I've decided to compose
"The Ballad of Bowen"!

25:20.817 --> 25:25.015
- How do you prefer I should write this?
- Far away!

25:25.054 --> 25:28.285
Oh, don't concern yourself
with my safety!

25:28.357 --> 25:31.520
I mean verse, meter.

25:32.795 --> 25:36.162
Shall I spice it up
with a poetical flourish...

25:36.232 --> 25:38.860
or just the cold, hard facts?

25:38.901 --> 25:40.869
If you do not be quiet...

25:40.903 --> 25:43.895
you and I shall be the only things
that are cold and hard around here.

25:44.006 --> 25:47.908
I mean, it's all very well to go
hacking and whacking at dragons.

25:47.977 --> 25:52.573
But if a dragon falls in the
forest and nobody gets to hear
about it, does it make a thud?

25:52.648 --> 25:55.208
- Brother Gilbert.
- What?

26:05.194 --> 26:08.527
The quill is mightier than the s--

26:08.598 --> 26:10.532
Ooh.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.229
The quill is mightier than the--

26:22.879 --> 26:25.939
That's all that's left
of the last dragonslayer...

26:26.048 --> 26:28.278
who tangled with me!

26:28.384 --> 26:30.784
If I were you,
I'd quit while I was ahead.

26:38.728 --> 26:42.186
Is that the best you can do?

26:46.135 --> 26:48.103
Catch!

26:48.137 --> 26:51.629
You know, I've got quite
a collection of victims in here.

26:51.741 --> 26:53.936
I won't be added to it!

26:56.812 --> 26:59.940
I've given you
my final warning.

26:59.982 --> 27:02.951
Into the mouth of death he strode.

27:02.985 --> 27:06.045
Into the gringy gloom.

27:06.122 --> 27:08.886
Into the pit of fear unknown...

27:08.958 --> 27:11.620
perhaps to court his doom.

27:11.661 --> 27:14.221
That was good.

27:14.297 --> 27:16.629
What did I say?
What did I say?

27:24.340 --> 27:27.002
A little damp for fire,
isn't it?

27:27.109 --> 27:30.806
Why must you knight-errands
out to make a name for yourselves...

27:30.846 --> 27:32.837
always pick on us dragons?

27:32.949 --> 27:35.281
I don't need a name!

27:35.351 --> 27:37.649
And I have a collection of my own!

27:37.687 --> 27:41.145
Yeah? You're one
who kills dragons for money.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.624
It's honest enough work.

27:43.693 --> 27:45.661
One must earn a living.

27:45.695 --> 27:49.859
Oh, yes, one must live.

27:49.966 --> 27:53.868
Well, since you seek a profit,
we might as well begin.

27:53.970 --> 27:56.530
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

27:56.605 --> 28:00.041
It's not the profit.
It's the pleasure.

28:00.142 --> 28:04.340
Perhaps less pleasurable
and more costly than you think!

28:09.352 --> 28:12.185
Bowen! Bowen, take care!

28:12.221 --> 28:14.883
He went that way!

28:14.991 --> 28:17.118
Take care, Bowen!

29:07.843 --> 29:10.437
You can't fly forever!

29:10.546 --> 29:14.073
- Neither can you!
- Slow down!

29:14.116 --> 29:17.711
Come, visit the woods!

29:19.789 --> 29:22.121
Whoa!

29:28.764 --> 29:32.598
Look out! Well done!

29:32.635 --> 29:35.627
- Ow!
- Pity. That must have hurt.

29:35.738 --> 29:37.797
- Yeah!
- Again?

29:37.907 --> 29:39.807
- Ow!
- And again?

29:39.875 --> 29:42.105
How do you like the ride so far?

29:43.913 --> 29:46.814
We're earning our money now,
aren't we?

29:48.617 --> 29:51.780
Now, is there somewhere you
would like me to drop you off?

29:58.928 --> 30:01.396
Yikes!

30:07.903 --> 30:12.067
The sword against the fang and claw.
The flame against the shield.

30:12.141 --> 30:14.132
Blah, blah, blah,
which one would win?

30:14.176 --> 30:17.839
Blah, blah,
field, shield, wield.

30:17.947 --> 30:20.575
Whose flesh from bones
be peeled. Oh, no.

30:20.649 --> 30:24.642
Whose fate would soon be sealed.

30:24.687 --> 30:26.678
Whose fate would soon be sealed?

30:26.789 --> 30:29.815
Whose fate would soon be sealed!

30:31.861 --> 30:36.321
Oh, you're good. Haven't had
this sort of challenge in some time.

30:36.365 --> 30:38.458
Nor likely to again!

31:04.894 --> 31:06.828
Drat!

31:12.334 --> 31:14.734
A little overconfident, aren't we?

31:14.837 --> 31:18.398
Hardly. But if you win,
you'll be out of work.

31:18.474 --> 31:22.410
I will not stop until I've rid the world
of every last one of you.

31:22.511 --> 31:24.741
I am the last one!

31:47.403 --> 31:51.430
You're just trying to save
your scaly hide with tricks.

31:53.842 --> 31:56.572
Haven't you noticed the pickings
are rather slim these days?

31:57.613 --> 31:59.945
I got me one just the other day.

32:00.049 --> 32:04.452
So it was you who killed the
Scarred One. She and I were the last.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.421
Must've been a proud kill, warrior.

32:07.456 --> 32:10.789
How much gold did her tattered carcass
put in your purse?

32:10.893 --> 32:13.020
That's none of your business.

32:13.095 --> 32:16.866
Couldn't have been very much.
And you'll kill me for sport?

32:16.999 --> 32:19.797
And when there are
no more dragons to slay...

32:19.902 --> 32:22.029
how will you make
a living, Knight?

32:22.104 --> 32:23.867
Shut up!

32:39.121 --> 32:41.487
Whoa!

32:43.993 --> 32:48.828
If your teeth come down, my sword
goes up, right into your brain!

32:54.003 --> 32:57.769
If your sword goes up,
my teeth come down!

32:57.840 --> 33:01.503
Into the moonlit night
the titans dueled...

33:01.610 --> 33:04.511
in mortal combat bound.

33:04.613 --> 33:09.073
Oh, who'd the fatal
false step make?

33:09.151 --> 33:12.518
Whose blood
would stain the ground?

33:32.041 --> 33:35.602
Oh, good Lord.
Sir Eglamore.

33:35.678 --> 33:38.704
Oh, thank you very much.

33:38.781 --> 33:41.045
It's been stuck down there
for months.

33:41.116 --> 33:43.380
Can you get your buttocks
off my tongue?

33:43.452 --> 33:45.545
Why should you
be comfortable?

33:45.654 --> 33:50.023
My armor is rusting in your drool,
and your breath is absolutely foul.

33:50.059 --> 33:52.186
Well, what do you expect...

33:52.227 --> 33:55.196
with old knights
rotting between my molars?

33:55.230 --> 33:57.357
Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.

34:00.569 --> 34:02.867
No, no, no, stop!

34:02.905 --> 34:04.896
No, stop!

34:08.210 --> 34:11.407
Sorry about that.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.415
It seems we're in a bit
of a stalemate, wouldn't you say?

34:14.516 --> 34:17.576
Yuck! But I can go
three days without sleep.

34:17.686 --> 34:19.813
I can go three weeks.

34:19.888 --> 34:23.324
Ooh! I'll stab you
before I nod off.

34:23.391 --> 34:27.761
And I'll chomp you.
Marvelous, we'll kill each other.

34:27.862 --> 34:30.388
- What do you suggest?
- A truce.

34:30.431 --> 34:33.560
Get out of my mouth
and let's talk face-to-face.

34:33.601 --> 34:36.435
How do I know I can trust you?

34:36.505 --> 34:39.371
I give you my word.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.501
The word of a dragon.
It's worthless.

34:42.578 --> 34:46.105
Stubborn lout!

34:49.385 --> 34:52.286
I should have known!

34:52.388 --> 34:55.186
Go on. Kill me!

34:59.962 --> 35:02.795
I don't want to kill you!
I never did!

35:02.898 --> 35:05.298
And I don't want you to kill me!

35:05.401 --> 35:07.301
How do we gain?

35:07.403 --> 35:10.395
If you win, you lose a trade.

35:10.472 --> 35:13.305
If I win, I wait around
for the next sword slinger...

35:13.409 --> 35:15.900
thirsting to carve a reputation
out of my hide.

35:17.079 --> 35:19.309
And I'm tired of lurking in holes...

35:19.415 --> 35:21.440
and skulking in darkness.

35:22.284 --> 35:24.218
I'm gonna let you up now.

35:24.286 --> 35:26.652
And if you insist...

35:26.722 --> 35:30.158
we can pursue this fracas
to its final stupidity.

35:30.225 --> 35:34.389
Or you can listen
to my alternative.

35:43.272 --> 35:45.001
Hmm?

35:45.074 --> 35:48.168
What's the alternative?

35:53.348 --> 35:56.340
Father, Father, look!

35:59.188 --> 36:01.156
Dragon!

36:05.327 --> 36:08.194
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

36:08.263 --> 36:10.322
Out of the way!

36:36.859 --> 36:39.521
Pesky critters, dragons.

36:41.296 --> 36:43.230
You!

36:43.298 --> 36:46.734
Like big rats.
You never seem to get rid of them.

36:46.835 --> 36:50.566
Unless you pay me
two bags of gold, in advance.

36:59.248 --> 37:01.375
Come on, Dragon.

37:03.252 --> 37:05.846
Come on, Dragon.

37:07.089 --> 37:09.057
Yes!

37:10.692 --> 37:12.592
Ow!

38:00.776 --> 38:04.075
Hmm.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.414
Hello.

38:08.483 --> 38:12.044
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.487
Most profitable, Dragon.
I should have met you a long time ago.

38:15.557 --> 38:17.991
There is much gold in the world.

38:18.060 --> 38:21.723
Perhaps when you've had your fill of it,
you'll no longer need me.

38:21.797 --> 38:25.324
I am a Knight of the Old Code.
My word is my bond.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.927
- No compunctions then?
- About what?

38:29.004 --> 38:33.065
Well, such deception hardly befits
a Knight of the Old Code.

38:33.141 --> 38:37.669
Fleecing Einon's lackeys.
That's a service to mankind.

38:37.779 --> 38:39.337
Is it?

38:39.448 --> 38:42.508
When you squeeze the nobility,
it's the peasants who feel the pinch.

38:42.584 --> 38:44.779
That's not my concern.

38:44.853 --> 38:48.448
Why should I stick my neck out
for people afraid to risk their own?

38:48.523 --> 38:51.083
Don't clutter up
a clever scheme with morality.

38:51.159 --> 38:53.423
Mmm, so be it...

38:54.496 --> 38:57.488
Knight of the Old Code.

38:57.532 --> 39:01.434
If I wanted my conscience pricked,
I would have stayed with the priest!

39:01.503 --> 39:04.666
Huh! And what does a dragon
know of the Old Code, anyway?

39:04.706 --> 39:06.867
His blade defends the helpless.

39:06.942 --> 39:11.345
His might upholds the weak.
His word speaks only truth.

39:11.380 --> 39:14.178
Shut up! I remember.

39:14.216 --> 39:17.447
That's all it is, a memory.
Nothing can bring it back.

39:17.519 --> 39:20.386
You sound like one who tried.

39:20.489 --> 39:22.389
And failed.

39:22.491 --> 39:26.052
So I no longer try to change the world,
Dragon. I just try to get by in it.

39:26.128 --> 39:29.120
Yes, it's better than death,
I suppose.

39:29.197 --> 39:31.893
Oh, is it? I should think
you'd welcome death.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.027
You know, the last of your kind,
all your friends dead,
hunted wherever you go.

39:38.140 --> 39:41.166
Do you delight in reminding me?

39:41.243 --> 39:44.701
Yes, Knight,
I do long for death.

39:45.981 --> 39:48.040
But fear it.

39:53.588 --> 39:57.388
Why? Aside from your misery,
what's to lose?

39:58.327 --> 40:00.261
My soul.

40:31.359 --> 40:33.452
Finish him, Brok!

40:35.930 --> 40:38.364
Well, are you a man?

40:49.043 --> 40:51.773
Should he continue, Mother?

40:51.813 --> 40:58.480
Oh, the field belongs to the apparently
inexhaustible Sir Brok, my son.

41:21.676 --> 41:24.611
The quarry!

41:26.614 --> 41:29.515
First you beg mercy
for your father's fate.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.608
Then you try to avenge it.

41:32.820 --> 41:35.345
Now, you'll share it.

41:35.423 --> 41:38.620
In your kingdom, Einon,
there are worse fates than death.

41:41.462 --> 41:43.487
I'll think one up for you.

41:44.832 --> 41:49.098
- Take her away.
- No! No!

41:53.107 --> 41:55.166
He killed my father!

41:55.209 --> 41:57.700
He killed my father!

41:59.881 --> 42:02.941
He killed my father!

43:00.375 --> 43:02.843
I remember you now.

43:04.846 --> 43:06.871
I remember you.

43:09.283 --> 43:13.549
Your hair, like fire.

43:17.725 --> 43:20.250
You gave me this scar.

43:22.797 --> 43:24.731
Didn't you?

43:31.806 --> 43:35.970
I... owe... you.

43:50.992 --> 43:53.426
I can, uh--

43:53.494 --> 43:55.758
I really can.

44:03.004 --> 44:06.804
Sorry, Bowen.
I hope you like it well done.

44:12.647 --> 44:15.912
You must have hated us very much.

44:15.983 --> 44:18.508
I hated one of you.

44:18.586 --> 44:22.852
These I killed because I wanted
to kill him. But I never found him.

44:22.957 --> 44:26.188
I never will.
If you're the last, he must be dead.

44:26.260 --> 44:28.194
Oh, yes.

44:28.262 --> 44:30.526
Tell me, what was he like...

44:30.598 --> 44:33.089
this, uh, dragon
that you hated?

44:34.969 --> 44:37.802
He only had half a heart.

44:37.872 --> 44:40.363
But even that was enough
to pollute an innocent boy.

44:40.441 --> 44:43.376
Einon was no innocent!
He polluted the heart!

44:44.879 --> 44:46.847
How do you know that?

44:46.881 --> 44:49.111
How do you know that, Dragon?

44:51.219 --> 44:53.881
All dragons know that story.

44:53.988 --> 44:56.479
What was to be their hope
became their doom.

44:56.557 --> 45:00.891
A spoiled, ungrateful child was given
a great gift and destroyed it!

45:00.962 --> 45:06.229
No! I knew Einon.
I was his teacher.

45:06.334 --> 45:09.735
I taught him
the ways of honor, of right.

45:11.539 --> 45:13.530
Then he betrayed you...

45:13.574 --> 45:17.305
just as he betrayed
the dragon whose heart he broke.

45:17.378 --> 45:19.312
That's a lie, Dragon!

45:19.380 --> 45:23.578
Stop calling me "Dragon"!
I have a name.

45:25.153 --> 45:27.713
Well, what is it?

45:27.755 --> 45:30.747
You couldn't possibly pronounce it
in your tongue.

45:30.825 --> 45:34.022
- Try me.
- It's--

45:51.445 --> 45:55.438
Next time stab more flesh,
less cloth.

45:55.550 --> 45:58.041
I'll pierce your heart!

46:05.359 --> 46:07.452
You already did.

46:11.899 --> 46:16.529
A very special heart,
like no other.

46:16.604 --> 46:19.801
A black, withered thing
without pity.

46:24.412 --> 46:26.607
Then teach me.

46:27.815 --> 46:30.249
Pity me.

46:32.053 --> 46:34.146
I'll give you everything.

46:35.423 --> 46:38.119
Even power.

46:38.159 --> 46:41.060
You're so beautiful.

46:49.070 --> 46:51.732
Even power.

46:52.573 --> 46:55.064
Even a throne.

47:16.097 --> 47:18.031
Oh, dear.

47:18.099 --> 47:20.966
Thank you.
It's passed now.

47:21.035 --> 47:23.299
What was it?

47:23.371 --> 47:26.636
An old complaint
that acts up now and again.

47:28.776 --> 47:33.213
Forgive me if anything
I said, if I upset you.

47:33.314 --> 47:36.340
It wasn't you, not you.

48:11.419 --> 48:13.319
Don't be afraid.

48:13.387 --> 48:16.982
I won't let you suffer
the same fate as me.

48:17.058 --> 48:19.083
I've come to help you.

48:25.499 --> 48:28.764
This will bring you out
well below the castle walls.

48:43.884 --> 48:46.114
Thank--

48:50.558 --> 48:52.458
You.

48:59.699 --> 49:02.259
Have you been watching over me
all night?

49:02.335 --> 49:05.702
I've been thinking.

49:05.772 --> 49:08.707
Yes? About what?

49:08.808 --> 49:13.211
Many things.
Mostly about what to call you.

49:13.313 --> 49:15.372
I think I've found you a name.

49:15.482 --> 49:18.883
You say that as though you reached up
and plucked it from the sky.

49:18.985 --> 49:21.510
I did.

49:21.554 --> 49:23.886
Up there.

49:23.990 --> 49:26.220
Do you see that group of stars?

49:27.327 --> 49:30.558
I know those stars very well.

49:30.663 --> 49:34.155
- Do you see the shape that they make?
- Mm-hmm, a dragon.

49:34.234 --> 49:36.168
Yes.

49:36.302 --> 49:38.429
They call it "Draco."

49:38.538 --> 49:42.133
It means "dragon"
in the scholars' speech.

49:42.242 --> 49:44.802
So instead of calling me
"Dragon" in your tongue...

49:44.911 --> 49:47.402
you'll call me "Dragon"
in some other tongue.

49:47.447 --> 49:50.245
You're right.
It's silly.

49:50.316 --> 49:54.912
No. No, I would be honored
to be named after those stars.

49:54.988 --> 49:57.821
I-- I truly would.

49:59.225 --> 50:01.125
Thank you, Bowen.

50:02.262 --> 50:04.162
Draco.

50:09.769 --> 50:13.762
Throw off the yoke
of Einon's oppression!

50:13.807 --> 50:16.970
We must start to fight back!

50:17.076 --> 50:20.273
Your father sang that sour tune once,
and we did fight back.

50:20.313 --> 50:22.645
And once was enough!
We'll not dance to it again!

50:22.749 --> 50:25.240
No, Hewe, just cringe
like a dog under Einon's boot.

50:25.318 --> 50:27.650
At least a cringing dog's
a live one!

50:27.687 --> 50:30.952
Hey! Why waste good food
on bad rhetoric?

50:32.091 --> 50:34.082
I speak the truth.

50:34.160 --> 50:38.028
Truth?
It's rarely inspiring, lass.

50:38.131 --> 50:40.258
And it never wins rebellions...

50:40.333 --> 50:44.326
but it will stretch necks,
if there is a neck...

50:44.437 --> 50:47.167
underneath that little mud pie.

50:54.514 --> 50:57.779
Ready or not, here I come!

50:58.852 --> 51:00.649
Dragon!

51:07.327 --> 51:09.955
It's Draco!

51:10.029 --> 51:11.963
About time.

51:18.671 --> 51:20.571
Mmm!

51:20.673 --> 51:24.040
It seems you people
are in need of a dragonslayer.

51:25.645 --> 51:28.375
Where is the lord responsible
for this village?

51:29.983 --> 51:32.383
Brok lives in a big house
about six miles away.

51:32.485 --> 51:35.852
But he'll only blame any damage on us
and pluck our pockets to pay for it.

51:35.922 --> 51:39.824
I won't pluck them as deeply.
I'll make you a fair offer.

51:39.893 --> 51:42.327
Take it, or leave him!

51:52.872 --> 51:56.239
It's enough you people
grovel to Einon.

51:56.342 --> 51:59.334
Will you be bullied by some broken-down,
blackmailing knight as well?

51:59.412 --> 52:03.007
That's right, you don't need me.

52:03.082 --> 52:05.016
Settle it yourself.

52:05.084 --> 52:07.518
Of course, there are other ways.

52:07.587 --> 52:09.851
Perhaps you'll part with...

52:09.923 --> 52:12.915
one of your precious daughters,
instead of gold.

52:18.431 --> 52:23.300
Dragons are partial
to maiden sacrifices, I hear.

52:23.621 --> 52:27.990
Don't do this!
Don't do this to me!

52:29.326 --> 52:31.351
I was born in this village!

52:31.462 --> 52:33.430
You knew my father!
You knew my mother!

52:33.497 --> 52:36.625
- Who's the girl?
- A nuisance. Get rid of her.

52:36.667 --> 52:39.534
- Why?
- They're trying to placate you
with a sacrifice.

52:39.637 --> 52:42.299
Now, whoever gave them
that bright idea?

52:42.339 --> 52:45.001
- Never mind. Just get rid of her!
- How?

52:45.109 --> 52:47.009
- Eat her!
- Oh, please! Yuck!

52:47.111 --> 52:49.545
Aren't we squeamish?
You ate Sir Eglamore, hypocrite.

52:49.647 --> 52:52.810
I merely chewed in self-defense,
but I never swallowed.

52:52.850 --> 52:54.818
Improvise.

52:54.852 --> 52:57.184
All right, all right.

52:58.289 --> 53:00.689
He's coming! Quick!

53:29.987 --> 53:31.978
You have a beautiful voice.

53:32.056 --> 53:36.584
Oh, thank you. We dragons
love to sing when we're happy.

53:36.694 --> 53:39.595
Well, you're not like
a dragon at all.

53:39.697 --> 53:42.598
Well, how many dragons
do you know?

53:42.700 --> 53:45.032
Well, you're the first.

53:45.069 --> 53:48.038
You should never listen
to minstrels' fancies.

53:48.072 --> 53:51.872
A dragon would never hurt a soul,
unless they tried to hurt him first.

53:51.942 --> 53:54.877
Really? Then why were you
in my village?

53:54.945 --> 53:57.243
Oh! The village!

53:57.348 --> 54:00.215
Yes, the village!
You remember the village?

54:00.251 --> 54:04.347
Leave him alone, you bully!
Run, Draco, fly! I'll hold him!

54:04.421 --> 54:07.447
- Pick on someone your own size!
- Where have you been?

54:07.558 --> 54:09.549
I'm truly sorry, Bowen.

54:09.593 --> 54:12.756
I've been distracted.

54:14.431 --> 54:17.628
Bowen, meet Kara.

54:19.203 --> 54:22.969
- You should have eaten her.
- Oh, don't get angry, Bowen.

54:23.073 --> 54:25.041
Why not?

54:25.109 --> 54:27.737
You left me high and dry.
I was worried to death!

54:27.778 --> 54:30.440
Worried? About me?

54:30.547 --> 54:32.777
Yes, about you!

54:32.816 --> 54:37.082
I had the whacker all set up.
Half the village is out there with me.

54:37.121 --> 54:40.215
We're searching the skies for you,
I don't know where you are.

54:40.291 --> 54:43.283
If you're coming back,
when you're coming back. You just--

54:45.095 --> 54:46.619
Disappear.

54:48.132 --> 54:50.100
Be careful!
He's coming!

55:06.817 --> 55:09.752
Well, well, well,
it can't be!

55:09.820 --> 55:11.754
But it is!

55:11.822 --> 55:14.848
My old mentor.
Still giving carving lessons?

55:14.958 --> 55:16.983
Get off your horse.
I'll give you one.

55:17.094 --> 55:20.586
Time's not been
kind to you, Bowen.

55:20.664 --> 55:24.430
- You should never have broke with me.
- It was you who broke with me!

55:24.501 --> 55:27.664
And yet you return to me
with this girl I lost.

55:30.307 --> 55:33.299
I think she wants to stay lost.

55:33.344 --> 55:35.972
Not her decision, I'm afraid!

55:47.858 --> 55:50.019
I'm ready for my lesson now, Knight.

56:19.523 --> 56:22.390
That's one lesson you never learned!

56:22.493 --> 56:24.893
Only expose your back
to a corpse!

56:27.164 --> 56:29.826
You are a corpse!

56:29.900 --> 56:31.891
You just don't know it!

56:37.574 --> 56:39.906
Lie down, Bowen!

56:40.010 --> 56:43.275
You're the sorry scrap
of dead worlds and dead beliefs.

56:43.380 --> 56:46.747
No! They were your beliefs!

56:46.850 --> 56:48.841
Never. Never mine.

56:53.190 --> 56:56.717
You said the words!
You spoke them from your heart!

56:56.760 --> 56:59.092
I vomited them up
because I couldn't stomach them!

56:59.196 --> 57:02.188
Because I knew it was
what you wanted to hear!

57:02.266 --> 57:05.793
Lies! Liar!
I taught you!

57:05.903 --> 57:08.736
You taught me to fight,
that's all!

57:08.772 --> 57:12.401
I took what I needed from you.

57:12.443 --> 57:15.435
You taught me to fight!

57:28.459 --> 57:30.552
You taught me well.

58:11.502 --> 58:13.936
Who asked you to interfere?

58:15.105 --> 58:18.268
I had everything under control!

58:32.856 --> 58:35.552
Here, let me see.

58:38.695 --> 58:41.323
It's knitted well.

58:41.398 --> 58:44.299
You have a healer's touch, Kara.

58:46.470 --> 58:49.064
In a few days,
it'll be just another scar.

58:49.172 --> 58:52.471
And what's one more scar?

58:52.542 --> 58:55.978
To a knight, I mean.
I once knew a knight.

58:56.046 --> 58:58.207
He stood all alone
against an evil king...

58:58.315 --> 59:00.715
and even saved a rebel leader
from blinding.

59:00.817 --> 59:02.910
He must have had many scars.

59:03.019 --> 59:06.182
- That knight died
of his wounds long ago.
- That's too bad.

59:06.256 --> 59:08.690
His kind is badly missed
in this world.

59:08.758 --> 59:12.023
- That's the way
the wretched world is, girl.
- Doesn't have to be.

59:13.396 --> 59:16.593
Men like you could--
could lead others.

59:16.700 --> 59:18.930
You could give people
courage and hope.

59:19.035 --> 59:22.903
Hope? Even if you
could raise your army...

59:23.006 --> 59:25.566
do you think they'd stand a chance
against seasoned troops?

59:25.675 --> 59:27.768
Last time they tried
it was a massacre.

59:27.878 --> 59:31.541
- I remember. I was there.
- So was l.

59:33.083 --> 59:35.074
That rebel was my father.

59:37.053 --> 59:40.921
Let others stand with you. You'll see
this time the end will be different.

59:45.228 --> 59:47.458
What are you looking at?

59:47.564 --> 59:51.933
Myself, once upon a time.

59:55.372 --> 59:57.567
I'll see you in the village, Draco.

59:57.641 --> 01:00:00.769
That's easy for you to say.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:04.439
This time I'll collect the money,
and you can die.

01:00:26.636 --> 01:00:29.571
We can lose no more pigs
to this dragon.

01:00:29.639 --> 01:00:31.903
Wait!

01:00:31.975 --> 01:00:35.502
This man is a fraud!

01:00:36.947 --> 01:00:39.279
It's her!

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:42.443
This girl is a...
wandering idiot.

01:00:42.519 --> 01:00:44.510
She babbles nonsense.

01:00:44.621 --> 01:00:48.284
I'm telling you,
this knight is no dragonslayer.

01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:50.485
You're mistaken, my child!

01:00:50.527 --> 01:00:53.826
He's the greatest dragonslayer
there is!

01:00:53.863 --> 01:00:56.161
Possibly the greatest
there ever will be!

01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:58.599
- Brother Gilbert!
- Bowen!

01:00:58.668 --> 01:01:00.693
You're alive.

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:04.171
Praised be the saints.
The saints be blessed.

01:01:04.207 --> 01:01:06.334
You're alive!

01:01:06.376 --> 01:01:10.472
- And whole.
- Brother Gilbert.

01:01:10.547 --> 01:01:13.345
You could not put your trust
in a better man.

01:01:13.383 --> 01:01:16.375
I personally have seen him slay
almost two dragons.

01:01:16.486 --> 01:01:18.511
- Oh, Brother Gilbert.
- Almost.

01:01:18.555 --> 01:01:21.888
Well, I didn't actually see
the death blow of the second...

01:01:21.992 --> 01:01:25.018
but as Bowen is here,
he must have won.

01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:30.229
Don't you see?
He's in league with the dragon.

01:01:47.917 --> 01:01:50.044
Hold that there.

01:01:52.555 --> 01:01:55.046
And here he comes.

01:02:16.446 --> 01:02:18.846
Sink! Sink!

01:02:18.915 --> 01:02:21.543
I can't!
It doesn't get any deeper!

01:02:21.618 --> 01:02:24.451
Well done, Bowen!
You've done it again!

01:02:24.521 --> 01:02:28.617
What a brute!
That's even bigger than the last one!

01:02:28.725 --> 01:02:30.955
Actually,
he's about the same size.

01:02:40.303 --> 01:02:42.567
- Meat.
- Meat.

01:02:42.639 --> 01:02:45.403
Meat! Meat!

01:02:53.049 --> 01:02:55.108
Oh, dear.

01:02:56.619 --> 01:02:59.986
Run! He's getting away!

01:03:27.784 --> 01:03:29.752
What's going on?

01:03:29.819 --> 01:03:31.514
Meat!

01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:34.920
- Meat! Meat!
- Meat!

01:03:34.991 --> 01:03:37.653
Run. That's what's going on!

01:03:37.694 --> 01:03:40.527
- Run.
- Run?

01:03:45.869 --> 01:03:47.803
Kara! Kara!

01:03:57.447 --> 01:04:01.543
Peace, brothers, peace!
Heathens!

01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:03.551
Brother Gilbert!

01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:09.047
Oh, good Lord.
Forgive me, my child.

01:04:09.159 --> 01:04:11.059
Liar! Liar!

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.060
No dragon, no charge.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.331
Meat. Meat.

01:04:22.405 --> 01:04:24.339
Meat. Meat.

01:04:24.407 --> 01:04:26.898
Meat. Meat. Meat.

01:04:33.716 --> 01:04:35.707
We're going to die!

01:04:35.752 --> 01:04:38.414
God help us!
We're all going to die!

01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:41.081
Calm yourself, Brother Gilbert,
we're not going to die.

01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:43.091
We're just flying.

01:04:43.193 --> 01:04:45.684
If you're going
to get yourself killed...

01:04:45.762 --> 01:04:48.026
you might as well do it
in the fight against Einon.

01:04:48.097 --> 01:04:50.588
I think Kara has a point. Oh!

01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:54.002
But I'd rather discuss it
on the ground.

01:04:59.273 --> 01:05:03.266
Draco, what unholy place is this?

01:05:03.344 --> 01:05:05.335
Unholy?

01:05:05.413 --> 01:05:09.509
This is Avalon, the resting place
of King Arthur himself.

01:05:11.085 --> 01:05:13.747
So it was foretold...

01:05:13.788 --> 01:05:17.189
and so have I found you,
brave King Arthur.

01:05:17.258 --> 01:05:19.783
Valor,

01:05:19.894 --> 01:05:23.591
virtue, truth.

01:05:23.631 --> 01:05:26.964
Ah, yes, truth.

01:05:27.068 --> 01:05:30.595
Amen. Ready now, Kara.

01:05:31.639 --> 01:05:33.573
And you, Bowen?

01:05:36.077 --> 01:05:40.446
This is Avalon,
the shadow realm of the Round Table.

01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:43.917
- It's a divine omen.
- Omens won't win battles.

01:05:43.985 --> 01:05:45.919
Nor will you.

01:05:45.987 --> 01:05:49.718
And you'll find out
when you try to raise your army.

01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:52.316
You already know
the courage in your village.

01:05:52.427 --> 01:05:55.328
They're very brave at pelting
young girls with vegetables.

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:57.557
It must start somewhere.

01:05:57.632 --> 01:05:59.657
Will you wish us luck, Draco?

01:06:01.302 --> 01:06:05.466
Long ago, when man was young
and the dragon already old...

01:06:05.506 --> 01:06:07.997
the wisest of our race
took pity on man.

01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:10.475
He gathered together
all the dragons...

01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:13.674
making them vow
to watch over man always.

01:06:13.781 --> 01:06:16.079
And at the moment of his death...

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:19.677
the night became alive
with those stars.

01:06:19.787 --> 01:06:22.688
And thus was born
the dragons' heaven.

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:27.659
But when we die, not all dragons
are admitted to this shining place.

01:06:27.695 --> 01:06:29.686
No, we have to earn it.

01:06:29.797 --> 01:06:31.958
And if we don't...

01:06:32.033 --> 01:06:35.366
our spirit disappears
as if we never were.

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:39.964
And that's why I shared my life force
with a dying boy...

01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:42.305
so I would reunite
man and dragon...

01:06:42.376 --> 01:06:46.710
and ensure my place
among my ancient brothers of the sky.

01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:50.979
But my sacrifice
became my sin.

01:06:51.052 --> 01:06:55.489
It was you. Your heart
beats in Einon's breast.

01:07:00.328 --> 01:07:03.126
Yes, my half-heart...

01:07:03.197 --> 01:07:06.291
that cost me all of my soul.

01:07:06.367 --> 01:07:10.633
Even then I knew
his bloodthirsty nature...

01:07:10.705 --> 01:07:14.038
but I thought
my heart could change him.

01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:16.066
My God, I was so naive.

01:07:17.044 --> 01:07:18.978
No more than l.

01:07:19.046 --> 01:07:22.812
All my life I've dreamed
of serving noble kings...

01:07:22.884 --> 01:07:24.909
noble ideals.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.920
Dreams die hard...

01:07:28.022 --> 01:07:30.923
and you hold them in your hands
long after they've turned to dust.

01:07:32.426 --> 01:07:35.020
I will not be that naive again!

01:07:38.833 --> 01:07:41.097
Kara, I will go with you.

01:07:47.275 --> 01:07:49.436
So be it.

01:07:49.544 --> 01:07:51.910
Farewell, Bowen.

01:08:01.756 --> 01:08:03.747
Valor!

01:08:03.791 --> 01:08:05.918
Valor!

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.226
Valor!
A knight is sworn to valor.

01:08:56.277 --> 01:08:58.336
A knight is sworn to valor.

01:08:58.446 --> 01:09:00.743
A knight is sworn to valor!

01:09:00.814 --> 01:09:03.613
His heart knows only virtue.

01:09:03.684 --> 01:09:05.913
His heart knows only virtue!

01:09:05.987 --> 01:09:08.319
His blade defends the helpless.

01:09:08.356 --> 01:09:10.517
His blade defends the helpless!

01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:12.854
His might upholds the weak.

01:09:12.926 --> 01:09:15.157
His might upholds the weak!

01:09:15.196 --> 01:09:17.630
His word speaks only truth.

01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:19.859
His word speaks only truth!

01:09:19.934 --> 01:09:22.027
His wrath undoes the wicked!

01:09:22.136 --> 01:09:24.934
His wrath undoes the wicked!

01:10:07.415 --> 01:10:09.883
Now I know you're completely mad.

01:10:09.917 --> 01:10:12.181
- You want us to follow you
and a priest against Einon?
- Yes.

01:10:12.253 --> 01:10:14.983
- To hell, more like.
- But this time we can win.
You don't understand.

01:10:15.056 --> 01:10:17.581
I don't want to understand!
I understand this!

01:10:17.658 --> 01:10:21.185
I understand six years in a quarry!
That's all I need to understand!

01:10:21.262 --> 01:10:23.753
Believe me, I know
what you've been through, Hewe.

01:10:23.864 --> 01:10:26.424
- But this time we've been joined--
- Only a fool would join you!

01:10:26.534 --> 01:10:28.695
You're not listening
to what I'm saying!

01:10:28.769 --> 01:10:30.760
I've had enough
of your mischief!

01:10:41.749 --> 01:10:44.343
Save your strength
for the fight against Einon.

01:10:44.418 --> 01:10:48.582
- There isn't any fight against Einon.
- I'm going to start one.

01:10:49.757 --> 01:10:52.191
You and what army, Knight?

01:11:17.418 --> 01:11:19.818
You have never fired
a bow in your life...

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.616
- in anger or in practice?
- No.

01:11:22.723 --> 01:11:25.157
Draw your bow.

01:11:25.259 --> 01:11:29.320
Sight along the arrow.
Release.

01:11:33.334 --> 01:11:35.928
Beginner's luck.
Try again.

01:11:41.509 --> 01:11:43.443
Steady.

01:11:46.514 --> 01:11:50.143
Brother Gilbert, you're a natural.

01:11:53.354 --> 01:11:55.322
Easy!

01:11:57.625 --> 01:12:00.185
Here, widen your stance.

01:12:02.963 --> 01:12:06.763
Up, down. Up, down.

01:12:06.834 --> 01:12:09.632
One fluid stroke.

01:12:16.877 --> 01:12:19.175
This could cleave
a man's skull.

01:12:24.785 --> 01:12:26.776
Like a pudding.

01:12:38.365 --> 01:12:41.493
Eat.

01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:04.714
Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:06.627 --> 01:13:09.926
- I need more men!
- It's just a few peasants
waving pitchforks!

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:12.328
I noticed they're all on your land.

01:13:12.399 --> 01:13:15.926
You're not too busy hawking
in your old age to keep control
of your minions, are you?

01:13:16.036 --> 01:13:18.937
You accuse me?

01:13:19.006 --> 01:13:23.067
I was just saying that any one of us
is worth a hundred of them.

01:13:25.112 --> 01:13:29.674
My brave Felton,
an army unto himself.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.684
Well.

01:13:32.286 --> 01:13:34.948
Fool!

01:13:35.055 --> 01:13:39.958
I know this man who leads them,
and I will not underestimate him!

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.392
Him or the dragon!

01:13:42.463 --> 01:13:44.727
Don't be afraid
of the dragon, my son.

01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:49.869
I'm afraid of nothing!

01:13:49.937 --> 01:13:51.871
Nothing!

01:13:51.939 --> 01:13:54.203
You understand?

01:14:02.483 --> 01:14:04.474
A mother's gift to her son.

01:14:04.585 --> 01:14:07.748
The finest to be had.

01:14:09.223 --> 01:14:11.316
The finest what?

01:14:12.493 --> 01:14:14.427
Dragonslayers.

01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:32.104
Have you thought beyond tomorrow?

01:14:32.179 --> 01:14:34.477
It's hard to see that far.

01:14:34.515 --> 01:14:37.075
Look at the camp. What do you see?

01:14:37.151 --> 01:14:41.019
- What do you hear?
- Hope.

01:14:41.121 --> 01:14:43.021
Exactly.

01:14:43.123 --> 01:14:46.684
Down there you have life,
songs and courage.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.957
You have everything
you'll ever need.

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:53.158
And now, so do l.

01:15:37.478 --> 01:15:40.470
He dares defy me at my own gates.
Look at him!

01:15:42.583 --> 01:15:46.485
Well, today his Code
dies once and for all!

01:15:46.553 --> 01:15:50.353
No! We're safe here,
Your Majesty!

01:15:50.424 --> 01:15:53.018
That rabble couldn't possibly
storm the castle!

01:15:53.093 --> 01:15:55.857
By tonight they'll be
cold and wet and tired.

01:15:55.929 --> 01:15:57.920
They'll probably
just limp off home.

01:16:01.268 --> 01:16:03.736
We're safe here, Einon!

01:16:03.771 --> 01:16:06.103
Remember your father!

01:16:44.478 --> 01:16:46.571
Gotcha!

01:17:02.329 --> 01:17:05.321
Bear to the right!

01:17:21.315 --> 01:17:24.079
Let's shear them
like the sheep they are!

01:17:26.186 --> 01:17:29.747
To the forest!

01:18:05.025 --> 01:18:06.856
Form up!

01:18:08.228 --> 01:18:11.356
Form up!

01:18:14.835 --> 01:18:16.826
Halt! Halt!

01:18:26.713 --> 01:18:28.704
Second line!

01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:32.542
Right flank, advance!

01:18:34.521 --> 01:18:37.752
Get in there,
second line!

01:18:42.763 --> 01:18:45.755
Charge!

01:19:13.627 --> 01:19:17.188
Scatter or die!

01:19:17.264 --> 01:19:20.290
Scatter or die! Go!

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.680
Like a pudding.

01:20:21.194 --> 01:20:23.526
Pride goeth before the fall.

01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:25.860
Help! Help!

01:20:27.968 --> 01:20:30.300
Help! Help!

01:20:32.372 --> 01:20:34.340
Turn the other cheek, brother.

01:21:06.706 --> 01:21:09.368
Retreat! Retreat!

01:21:09.408 --> 01:21:12.070
Retreat!

01:21:12.178 --> 01:21:14.840
Return to the castle!
Retreat!

01:21:14.914 --> 01:21:18.179
Brother Gilbert, it's Einon!
Stop him!

01:21:21.754 --> 01:21:23.517
Thou...

01:21:26.058 --> 01:21:28.424
shalt...

01:21:28.528 --> 01:21:30.860
not...

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:33.091
kill!

01:22:06.866 --> 01:22:08.857
The dragonslayers.

01:22:29.288 --> 01:22:31.722
Open up! It's the king!

01:22:37.396 --> 01:22:39.455
Stop!

01:22:39.565 --> 01:22:42.432
No! I want it alive!

01:22:46.505 --> 01:22:49.633
Alive and safe.

01:22:52.945 --> 01:22:55.971
Safe for all eternity.

01:22:56.015 --> 01:22:58.313
Oh, no.

01:22:58.351 --> 01:23:01.980
I go to save the dragon!

01:23:02.021 --> 01:23:04.182
Who will go with me?

01:23:36.956 --> 01:23:40.687
Come from the shadows, Aislinn.
Come where I can see you.

01:23:53.372 --> 01:23:56.671
- You know why I've come.
- I know.

01:23:56.742 --> 01:24:01.645
In giving my heart, I've taken on every
poison stirring in his evil breast.

01:24:01.714 --> 01:24:04.239
Even the pain of his death
must be mine.

01:24:04.317 --> 01:24:07.081
You cannot blame yourself.

01:24:09.021 --> 01:24:11.251
Death without immortality?

01:24:11.357 --> 01:24:13.882
That was not the only reason.

01:24:13.926 --> 01:24:16.190
I had to wait for a time
when mankind...

01:24:16.262 --> 01:24:19.891
would not repeat my mistake
and let tyranny thrive.

01:24:19.932 --> 01:24:22.662
When there would be those
who remembered the Once-ways...

01:24:22.735 --> 01:24:26.193
remembered that even in the darkness
there is still light.

01:24:27.773 --> 01:24:31.766
I cannot see.
Are the stars shining tonight?

01:24:35.281 --> 01:24:38.079
Brightly, my lord.

01:24:38.117 --> 01:24:40.085
Brightly.

01:24:40.119 --> 01:24:42.451
Then let us end it.

01:24:49.595 --> 01:24:51.529
Forgive me!

01:24:54.467 --> 01:24:57.561
I know why you brought me
the dragonslayers.

01:24:58.971 --> 01:25:01.701
You wanted them to kill him
because you wanted me dead.

01:25:01.774 --> 01:25:04.470
I wanted to correct
a mistake made years ago...

01:25:04.543 --> 01:25:07.637
when I saved a creature
not worth saving.

01:25:14.987 --> 01:25:17.148
How un-motherly of you.

01:25:49.955 --> 01:25:51.946
We have to open the gates.

01:25:52.024 --> 01:25:54.618
The rest of us
are waiting outside.

01:25:54.693 --> 01:25:57.253
Go save your dragon, Bowen.

01:25:57.329 --> 01:25:59.923
Hurry, all of you.

01:25:59.999 --> 01:26:01.933
It's this way.

01:26:07.706 --> 01:26:10.106
Well, well, well,
what a pleasant surprise.

01:26:10.176 --> 01:26:14.374
I expected you, Bowen,
but with my bride-to-be as well?

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.643
- And with a priest to wed us.
- To bury you.

01:26:20.152 --> 01:26:22.382
Well, to bury one of us.

01:26:26.725 --> 01:26:29.216
Kara, the door, quickly!

01:26:57.223 --> 01:27:00.021
Hurry up. That way.
That way.

01:27:00.092 --> 01:27:03.061
Quickly, this way.
This way.

01:27:03.095 --> 01:27:05.063
Come on. Hurry up.

01:27:47.973 --> 01:27:51.739
Now, I don't know how
you all got in here...

01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:56.577
but I tell you this:
you are going to get me out.

01:28:06.659 --> 01:28:09.651
Hewe, thank you.

01:28:43.862 --> 01:28:46.695
Let me cut it
down to size for you.

01:28:59.044 --> 01:29:01.205
A girl.

01:29:03.048 --> 01:29:05.141
A girl!

01:29:35.246 --> 01:29:37.680
Bowen!

01:29:47.926 --> 01:29:50.759
Lo, I'm immortal.

01:30:12.884 --> 01:30:15.682
- Yeah!
- Huh?

01:30:48.052 --> 01:30:51.112
Now it's you, Bowen.
It's you that has to do it!

01:30:51.155 --> 01:30:53.146
What are you talking about?

01:30:53.258 --> 01:30:57.126
As the heart binds Einon to me in life,
it binds us in death.

01:30:57.161 --> 01:31:00.756
- That's not true!
- You've seen that it is!

01:31:00.832 --> 01:31:03.767
Through the heart,
we share each other's pains and power.

01:31:03.835 --> 01:31:06.065
But in my half
beats the life source.

01:31:06.137 --> 01:31:08.401
For Einon to die,
I must die!

01:31:08.473 --> 01:31:10.464
Einon is dead.

01:31:10.508 --> 01:31:13.500
- He lives!
- It doesn't matter.

01:31:13.611 --> 01:31:16.341
Don't you hear it?
Our rebels have stormed the castle.

01:31:16.447 --> 01:31:18.938
Alive or dead, Einon's beaten.
We've won!

01:31:19.017 --> 01:31:22.282
You will never win
until Einon's evil is destroyed...

01:31:22.353 --> 01:31:24.583
and to do that,
you must destroy me!

01:31:26.691 --> 01:31:29.455
Once you swore your sword
and service were mine...

01:31:29.527 --> 01:31:32.928
to call when I had need of you,
to ask what I would of you.

01:31:32.997 --> 01:31:35.522
I hold you to your vow, Knight!

01:31:37.001 --> 01:31:39.196
He's coming,
coming to stop you!

01:31:39.304 --> 01:31:42.364
Strike before it's too late!

01:31:51.816 --> 01:31:53.807
You are the last.

01:31:53.885 --> 01:31:56.877
My time is over. Strike!

01:31:58.556 --> 01:32:00.490
You are my friend.

01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:04.289
Then, as my friend,
strike, please!

01:32:05.396 --> 01:32:08.559
- I can't.
- Then I will make you.

01:32:11.035 --> 01:32:14.527
Fight back, dragonslayer!
Defend yourself!

01:32:27.418 --> 01:32:30.979
Pick it up!

01:32:31.055 --> 01:32:33.888
Move, and she dies!

01:34:12.123 --> 01:34:14.250
What now, Draco?

01:34:16.527 --> 01:34:18.688
Without you...

01:34:19.997 --> 01:34:22.431
what do we do?

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.968
Where do we turn?

01:34:40.384 --> 01:34:43.285
To the stars, Bowen.

01:34:43.354 --> 01:34:45.788
To the stars.

01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:31.617
And in the days following
Draco's sacrifice...

01:36:31.662 --> 01:36:35.826
Bowen and Kara led the people
in a time of justice and brotherhood.

01:36:35.933 --> 01:36:39.460
As I remember it now,
those were golden years...

01:36:39.503 --> 01:36:42.472
warmed by an unworldly light.

01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:45.168
And when things
became the most difficult...

01:36:45.243 --> 01:36:48.576
Draco's star shone
more brightly...

01:36:48.646 --> 01:36:51.479
for all of us
who knew where to look.
