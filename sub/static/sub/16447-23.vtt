00:00.027 --> 00:01.544
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.399 --> 00:04.165
What's this?
Oh, nothing,

00:04.167 --> 00:05.133
just some math we don't need.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.635
This is a different approach.

00:06.637 --> 00:09.537
You trying to get the
guidance system even smaller?

00:09.539 --> 00:11.439
It's just a... theory.

00:11.441 --> 00:13.141
Well, it's not even worked out.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.377
Oh.
(chuckles)

00:15.379 --> 00:17.145
I want this.

00:18.148 --> 00:21.082
Uh, but we've already met
the agreed upon specs.

00:21.084 --> 00:22.951
Going smaller
would require

00:22.953 --> 00:25.020
weeks' worth
of new computations.

00:25.022 --> 00:28.323
So get the kid
with the two shirts to do it.

00:29.726 --> 00:31.359
Sir, I mean, (stammers)
if I may,

00:31.361 --> 00:33.561
uh, we've put a lot
of thought and effort

00:33.563 --> 00:35.797
into this current prototype.

00:35.799 --> 00:36.865
It's a really
elegant solution,

00:36.867 --> 00:39.167
and most
importantly, it works.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.935
You both make excellent points.

00:40.937 --> 00:42.737
And thank you for presenting
it so articulately.

00:42.739 --> 00:44.939
(chuckles) Make this.

00:47.811 --> 00:49.277
Champagne,

00:49.279 --> 00:50.712
champagne,
Thank you.

00:50.714 --> 00:53.515
and for the world's tallest
second grader, apple juice.

00:54.918 --> 00:58.153
No bendy straw, some party.

00:59.222 --> 01:00.388
Hey, a-a toast.

01:00.390 --> 01:01.756
Thank you all for
your support

01:01.758 --> 01:03.858
while we worked on our
Air Force project.

01:03.860 --> 01:04.825
And please know that

01:04.828 --> 01:06.094
we could not have
done it without you,

01:06.096 --> 01:06.995
so cheers.

01:06.997 --> 01:08.363
ALL: Cheers.
(whoops)

01:08.365 --> 01:09.964
You know, it's nice of
you to acknowledge us,

01:09.966 --> 01:11.733
but this is your
accomplishment.

01:11.735 --> 01:13.935
Yeah, you guys did
this all on your own.

01:13.937 --> 01:15.637
Without me.

01:17.307 --> 01:18.707
To success without Raj.

01:18.709 --> 01:19.941
(all cheer)

01:20.777 --> 01:21.910
So what happens next?

01:21.912 --> 01:22.944
Phase two,

01:22.946 --> 01:24.079
we test it,
perfect it,

01:24.081 --> 01:25.914
and hope to live long
enough to see the movie

01:25.916 --> 01:27.882
based on our lives starring
more attractive versions of us.

01:27.884 --> 01:29.150
(all chuckle)

01:29.152 --> 01:31.119
Yeah, I'll definitely
live long enough--

01:31.121 --> 01:32.454
vitamin C.

01:33.490 --> 01:35.390
First thing tomorrow
morning, we're back at it.

01:35.392 --> 01:37.492
Without me.

01:37.494 --> 01:39.594
I hope his character doesn't
make it into the movie;

01:39.596 --> 01:41.763
he's kind of a bummer.

01:44.067 --> 01:46.167
FEMALE VOICE:
Leonard Hofstadter.

01:46.169 --> 01:47.802
Access granted.

01:47.804 --> 01:50.105
Hmm. I don't care if this
thing's burning out my retinas;

01:50.107 --> 01:51.773
it makes me feel special.

01:53.210 --> 01:55.210
Now, before we field test,
I think we...

01:58.081 --> 01:59.981
What the hell?

01:59.983 --> 02:00.949
Where is everything?

02:00.951 --> 02:02.951
Who else has access
to this room?

02:02.953 --> 02:05.253
It's a secure lab
in a classified facility;

02:05.255 --> 02:07.155
only the U.S. government and us.

02:07.157 --> 02:09.157
This is very disconcerting.

02:10.026 --> 02:12.761

Sir, I-I-I'm sorry
but I just don't get it.

02:41.468 --> 02:43.268
Y-You came into our lab

02:43.270 --> 02:45.337
in the middle of the night
and took our prototype

02:45.339 --> 02:47.372
and all of our research
and didn't even tell us?

02:47.374 --> 02:50.342
Sounds like you get it.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.478
Well, why would
you do that?

02:53.480 --> 02:55.981
You guys completed phase one,
we'll take it from here.

02:55.983 --> 02:58.049
Where did
you move it?

02:58.051 --> 02:59.217
I can't tell you that.

02:59.219 --> 03:01.686
Are you implementing phase two?

03:01.688 --> 03:02.854
I can't tell you that.

03:02.856 --> 03:04.790
Wait, so you're just
going to take all the work

03:04.792 --> 03:07.759
we've done for the last
year and toss us aside?

03:07.761 --> 03:11.163
That one I can tell you, yes.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.599
This is
all very upsetting.

03:14.601 --> 03:15.734
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:15.736 --> 03:17.169
As you know,

03:17.171 --> 03:19.304
the primary focus of
the United States military

03:19.306 --> 03:21.373
is people's feelings.

03:22.776 --> 03:26.211
If that's sarcasm,
please save it for our enemies.

03:28.882 --> 03:30.315
Well, I may be
moving out soon.

03:30.317 --> 03:31.983
I think I found
a place to live.

03:31.985 --> 03:33.618
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

03:33.620 --> 03:34.686
Really?

03:34.688 --> 03:37.222
You kept sending me
apartment listings.

03:39.359 --> 03:41.193
Um... well, I...

03:41.195 --> 03:43.061
yeah, you got me.

03:44.131 --> 03:45.497
Where are you moving?

03:45.499 --> 03:47.866
And when? But a-also where?

03:47.868 --> 03:50.936
Bert has a room for rent.

03:50.938 --> 03:52.404
So you're gonna be
roommates with Bert?

03:52.406 --> 03:54.372
Uh, no, it's, uh,
pretty private, actually,

03:54.374 --> 03:55.740
it's over his garage.

03:55.742 --> 03:58.210
So the only time I'll see him
is when he pulls his car in,

03:58.212 --> 04:01.513
does his laundry or practices
drums in my dining room.

04:02.783 --> 04:03.915
Well, good for you.
Mm-hmm.

04:03.917 --> 04:05.851
I actually have
a little news myself.

04:05.853 --> 04:07.819
Okay, we're just gonna circle
back to when he's moving out?

04:07.821 --> 04:08.954
Okay, that's cool.

04:10.591 --> 04:12.157
I was, uh, asked to be
a visiting researcher

04:12.159 --> 04:13.492
at Princeton.

04:13.494 --> 04:15.494
- Hey, that's amazing.
- Good for you. - Congratulations.

04:15.496 --> 04:17.394
Thanks, but the thing is
I'll be gone for a few months

04:17.397 --> 04:19.130
and I don't know how Sheldon's
gonna feel about that.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.565
Oh, come on, he's a grown man,
he can take care of himself.

04:21.567 --> 04:24.536
You really believe that?

04:25.405 --> 04:27.739
Once again, you got me.

04:30.544 --> 04:32.878
How can you work
on something for a year

04:32.880 --> 04:34.279
and they just take it?

04:34.281 --> 04:36.748
I can't believe the Air Force
would treat us like that.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.718
You know, I have a good mind
to stop paying my taxes.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.488
It's too bad I enjoy
doing them so much.

04:47.561 --> 04:50.061
The Air Force did it again.

04:50.063 --> 04:52.631
They're erasing our lives!

04:54.067 --> 04:56.635
Third floor,
wrong apartment.

04:58.272 --> 05:00.138
Although, if anyone's gonna
clean out your apartment

05:00.140 --> 05:03.275
and disappear,
it'd be Penny.

05:03.277 --> 05:04.409
She might disappear,

05:04.411 --> 05:06.278
but she's definitely
not cleaning anything.

05:12.586 --> 05:14.119
It's okay, everything's here.

05:15.455 --> 05:16.555
Oh, hey,
what's going on?

05:16.557 --> 05:17.489
You won't believe it;

05:17.491 --> 05:19.724
the military
confiscated our project.

05:19.726 --> 05:20.859
What?
You're kidding.

05:20.861 --> 05:21.993
Why would they do that?

05:21.995 --> 05:23.962
They wouldn't say.

05:23.964 --> 05:25.397
I feel so betrayed.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.699
You know, all my life I thought
Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle

05:27.701 --> 05:28.867
who brought you presents.

05:28.869 --> 05:31.970
Turns out he's
the other kind.

05:33.273 --> 05:34.472
Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

05:34.474 --> 05:36.942
Thank you. Can we just
talk about something else?

05:36.944 --> 05:38.310
Yeah, what's going on
with you guys?

05:38.312 --> 05:39.945
Give us some good news.

05:39.947 --> 05:41.680
Amy's got some news.

05:45.819 --> 05:48.687
Yeah, um...

05:48.689 --> 05:50.889
Raj is moving out.

05:51.992 --> 05:53.391
Oh, no.

05:53.393 --> 05:55.527
(sternly):
When?

05:59.266 --> 06:00.365
You doing okay?

06:00.367 --> 06:01.866
Not really.
(chuckles)

06:01.868 --> 06:04.235
Want me to put on
some Neil Diamond?

06:04.237 --> 06:06.438
That always makes
you feel better.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.806
No.

06:07.808 --> 06:11.009
Then you'll get all sexed up
and I'm not in the mood.

06:12.579 --> 06:14.846
I mean, an entire
year wasted.

06:14.848 --> 06:18.149
You might be forgetting another
accomplishment of the past year.

06:18.151 --> 06:21.853
Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought
life into the world.

06:22.589 --> 06:23.989
Really?

06:23.991 --> 06:26.524
That's the importance
you put on us having a baby?

06:26.526 --> 06:28.793
I'm happy about it, but, I mean,
it's not like I did much.

06:28.795 --> 06:30.161
I mean, after
the first three minutes

06:30.163 --> 06:32.764
it was pretty much all you.

06:35.769 --> 06:38.103
So, did you tell him
about Princeton yet?

06:38.105 --> 06:40.171
No, I'm waiting till
he's in a good mood.

06:40.173 --> 06:43.675
Oh, sweetie,
you might not live that long.

06:44.878 --> 06:46.611
I don't know,
maybe I shouldn't go.

06:46.613 --> 06:48.480
Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.

06:48.482 --> 06:50.849
I guess. And he'll have you and
Leonard right across the hall

06:50.851 --> 06:52.183
the whole time.

06:52.185 --> 06:54.986
Oh, damn, wait, you know,
maybe you shouldn't go...

06:54.988 --> 06:56.421
Got to go.

06:57.057 --> 06:58.223
Morning.

06:59.393 --> 07:03.628
I apologize for exceeding
my allotted bathroom time.

07:03.630 --> 07:04.796
Are you feeling okay?

07:04.798 --> 07:06.197
Not really.

07:06.199 --> 07:10.635
Apparently grief can
make one less regular.

07:10.637 --> 07:13.238
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.608
No, I sat and I sat,
but to no avail.

07:17.511 --> 07:20.779
Oh, the-the more details,
the more sorry.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.115
Well, maybe this'll
cheer you up.

07:24.117 --> 07:26.051
I made your favorite oatmeal...

07:26.053 --> 07:28.453
plain.

07:29.356 --> 07:30.955
What's the occasion?

07:30.957 --> 07:34.759
No occasion, I just wanted
to do something nice for you.

07:34.761 --> 07:37.162
You're so kind.

07:37.164 --> 07:39.431
You know, I don't know how
I ever got by without you.

07:40.934 --> 07:42.367
Oh.

07:42.369 --> 07:45.270
That's sweet, but you...
you did just fine on your own.

07:46.073 --> 07:47.472
Well, I thought that, too,

07:47.474 --> 07:50.575
but I've come to realize, I am
completely dependent on you.

07:52.446 --> 07:54.713
Sheldon, you're,
you're being silly.

07:54.715 --> 07:58.349
No, to wake up every morning
and know you're there

07:58.351 --> 08:00.251
is a great comfort to me.

08:01.521 --> 08:05.223
Mmm, tasteless.

08:08.862 --> 08:11.196
How do you do it?

08:12.799 --> 08:14.332
You know, what you need to do is

08:14.334 --> 08:15.834
put this Air Force
project behind you

08:15.836 --> 08:17.335
and just dive
into something new.

08:17.337 --> 08:20.939
Well, there is our
quantum cognition experiment.

08:20.941 --> 08:23.475
You and I could spend
more time on that.

08:23.477 --> 08:25.510
Oh, I don't know,

08:25.512 --> 08:27.912
I mean, let's say
we succeed in proving

08:27.914 --> 08:29.314
that our consciousness
creates reality.

08:29.316 --> 08:30.982
I mean, what will we have
really accomplished?

08:30.984 --> 08:34.251
You know, a loaf of bread's
still three bucks.

08:35.121 --> 08:36.721
I'm confused.

08:36.722 --> 08:39.224
You're always saying that you
want to spend more time with me.

08:39.226 --> 08:41.592
That is true, I have said that.

08:41.595 --> 08:43.761
Well, a lot, it's very annoying.

08:45.165 --> 08:47.298
Has something changed?

08:47.300 --> 08:49.768
Um, is there something
that you're not telling me?

08:53.073 --> 08:57.008
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

08:59.079 --> 09:00.612
Princeton?

09:00.614 --> 09:02.881
A fine institution.

09:04.184 --> 09:06.151
The place where
Albert Einstein taught.

09:06.153 --> 09:08.319
And where Leonard got his PhD,

09:08.321 --> 09:11.089
so it may have gone downhill.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.993
Yeah, that's the one.

09:14.995 --> 09:17.762
Well, that's wonderful.

09:17.764 --> 09:19.130
Congratulations.

09:19.132 --> 09:20.598
Well, I-I haven't
accepted it yet.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.433
I wanted to talk
to you first.

09:22.435 --> 09:23.601
Wh-What is there to talk about?

09:23.603 --> 09:25.236
You have to take it.
It's important.

09:25.238 --> 09:27.038
So are you.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.239
Thank you, but I'll be fine.

09:28.241 --> 09:29.707
Are-are you sure?

09:29.709 --> 09:34.145
Yes. I may have lost my guidance
system and my girlfriend,

09:34.147 --> 09:36.314
but I still have a colon
full of yesterday's meals

09:36.316 --> 09:38.416
to keep me company.

09:41.454 --> 09:42.821
Although, thanks to your
high-fiber breakfast,

09:42.823 --> 09:44.223
I'm sure that'll be
leaving me, too.

09:48.907 --> 09:50.087
Really?

09:50.088 --> 09:51.954
He doesn't put raisins
or banana slices

09:51.956 --> 09:54.424
or anything in it?

09:54.942 --> 09:58.410
I don't think plain oatmeal
was the point of that story.

09:58.412 --> 09:59.911
I mean, I like a
little brown sugar...

09:59.913 --> 10:03.348
Guys.

10:03.350 --> 10:04.916
You're still
gonna go, right?

10:04.918 --> 10:05.884
I don't know.

10:05.886 --> 10:08.086
Sheldon's so vulnerable
right now.

10:08.088 --> 10:09.688
Oh, come on. Look,
if the roles were reversed,

10:09.690 --> 10:11.489
he'd be on the first train
to New Jersey,

10:11.491 --> 10:14.826
or the second train if there
were teenagers on the first one.

10:14.828 --> 10:17.796
Well, distance
might be nice.

10:17.798 --> 10:19.698
The last time a big project
ended for Howie,

10:19.700 --> 10:21.566
he wouldn't stop
following me around.

10:21.568 --> 10:23.568
He even went with me
to get a mammogram.

10:23.570 --> 10:25.237
Well, what's wrong with that?

10:25.239 --> 10:26.972
No, he wanted
to get one with me,

10:26.974 --> 10:30.108
like some kind of weird
couple's massage.

10:30.110 --> 10:32.978
And yet you bore his child.
Neato.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.716
You're excited about
this opportunity, right?

10:37.718 --> 10:39.918
Of course. I get to be part
of the first team

10:39.920 --> 10:42.454
to use radon markers
to map the structures that...

10:42.456 --> 10:45.223
Okay, a simple yes will do.

10:45.225 --> 10:46.558
You have to go.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.927
I know, but what
if Sheldon...

10:48.929 --> 10:50.762
Okay, listen to me.
Your relationship can handle

10:50.764 --> 10:51.830
being long distance for a while.

10:51.832 --> 10:53.632
It's not like you two
are very physical.

10:53.634 --> 10:56.067
Hey, you don't know what
goes on behind closed doors.

10:56.069 --> 10:57.269
A lot of lectures?

10:57.271 --> 10:58.336
All right, so you know.

10:59.539 --> 11:01.573
I'm telling you,
if you don't go

11:01.575 --> 11:02.707
you'll end up
regretting it.

11:02.709 --> 11:03.708
WOLOWITZ:
Hey!

11:03.710 --> 11:06.144
Wait up!
Oh, great.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.181
You left something at home.

11:10.183 --> 11:11.216
A big hug!
Oh!

11:11.218 --> 11:13.485
(Wolowitz chuckles)

11:13.487 --> 11:15.720
I found it right next
to these kisses.

11:15.722 --> 11:17.355
(Wolowitz smooching)

11:17.357 --> 11:18.657
It's too late for me.

11:18.659 --> 11:20.325
Save yourself.

11:22.663 --> 11:25.430
So, are you excited to have
your own place again?

11:25.432 --> 11:27.899
I am, but I'll miss you guys.

11:27.901 --> 11:29.267
Ah, we'll miss you, too.

11:29.269 --> 11:32.904
Wha... you could try
saying that without smiling.

11:32.906 --> 11:36.374
I'm trying. This is
the best I can do.

11:36.376 --> 11:38.576
(harmonica playing)

11:45.886 --> 11:47.085
What are you doing?

11:47.087 --> 11:49.387
What does it look like?

11:49.389 --> 11:52.090
I'm playing sad harmonica...

11:52.092 --> 11:54.793
in an apartment
as empty as my heart.

11:54.795 --> 11:56.995
Why?

11:56.997 --> 11:59.597
I got the blues.

11:59.599 --> 12:01.733
My baby done left me.

12:01.735 --> 12:04.869
Come on, Sheldon.

12:04.871 --> 12:06.971
Amy's only gone
for a few months.

12:06.973 --> 12:09.507
And now that I'm moving out,
your old room is empty,

12:09.509 --> 12:10.975
so you can stay there
whenever you want.

12:10.977 --> 12:13.778
Uh, could I talk to you
in the hall for a sec?

12:13.780 --> 12:15.113
Yeah, sure.

12:21.355 --> 12:22.654
Sheldon, you're being silly.

12:22.656 --> 12:24.322
Am I?

12:24.324 --> 12:26.391
Yesterday
I had an Air Force project,

12:26.393 --> 12:27.692
a girlfriend who lived with me,

12:27.694 --> 12:30.929
and my good friend Raj
right across the hall.

12:30.931 --> 12:33.264
Do you really care
about that last one?

12:33.266 --> 12:36.601
No, but that list was sounding
a little thin.

12:36.603 --> 12:40.071
Instead of dwelling on the
negative, think about this.

12:40.073 --> 12:43.108
Your girlfriend was given
an amazing opportunity,

12:43.110 --> 12:44.976
which gives you
an opportunity

12:44.978 --> 12:48.279
to show her that you're a loving
and supportive boyfriend.

12:49.116 --> 12:52.250
So trick her.

12:53.086 --> 12:55.954
All right, let me start again.

12:55.956 --> 12:58.423
Uh... you and Amy...

12:58.425 --> 12:59.657
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Can I get my stuff?

12:59.659 --> 13:03.027
Sounds like it's
gonna be a while.

13:09.102 --> 13:11.569
I missed you.
(gasps)

13:11.571 --> 13:13.705
Come here, let's talk.

13:13.707 --> 13:15.974
Ooh. Sounds serious.

13:15.976 --> 13:17.409
Have I been a bad boy?

13:17.411 --> 13:18.443
Am I gonna get a spanking

13:18.445 --> 13:21.413
'cause you know I...
Just listen.

13:21.415 --> 13:23.415
I don't know if
you realize this,

13:23.417 --> 13:26.484
but whenever you're
between projects,

13:26.486 --> 13:28.953
you tend to get a
little insecure.

13:28.955 --> 13:30.522
Oh.
A little clingy.

13:30.524 --> 13:33.057
I know and I'm sorry.

13:33.059 --> 13:35.059
Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.

13:35.061 --> 13:37.629
Stop.

13:37.631 --> 13:39.564
I love when you're
affectionate,

13:39.566 --> 13:42.000
but this is not coming
from a good place.

13:42.002 --> 13:43.902
(laughing):
Well, excuse me,

13:43.904 --> 13:46.271
but what did you do when you
worked on that allergy drug

13:46.273 --> 13:48.940
for two years and the FDA
shut down your project?

13:48.942 --> 13:53.378
I signed us up for
ballroom dance class.

13:54.214 --> 13:56.514
Okay, and what did you do

13:56.516 --> 13:59.350
when they took you
off the antifungal team?

13:59.352 --> 14:03.388
I made us have a baby.

14:03.390 --> 14:06.591
So?

14:06.593 --> 14:08.426
Bring it in.

14:08.428 --> 14:10.562
(both chuckle)

14:10.564 --> 14:14.566
And now the movie
just got rated "R."

14:18.104 --> 14:19.337
Hey.

14:19.339 --> 14:20.939
You going somewhere?

14:20.941 --> 14:26.277
No, but you are, so I got
you this as a present.

14:26.279 --> 14:28.580
Sheldon, that isn't necessary.

14:28.582 --> 14:29.881
No, it is.

14:29.883 --> 14:31.249
Leonard pointed out to me

14:31.251 --> 14:34.085
that I'm not always a loving
and supportive boyfriend,

14:34.087 --> 14:38.456
so here's some
quality luggage.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.558
Thank you.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.361
The salesman said it could
survive a plane crash, so...

14:45.732 --> 14:48.633
Perhaps you should fly
inside it.

14:52.906 --> 14:55.273
Does this mean you're
okay with me going?

14:55.275 --> 14:57.308
Well, I'm not looking
forward to it,

14:57.310 --> 14:59.844
but it is a wonderful
opportunity

14:59.846 --> 15:01.679
and you need to take it.

15:01.681 --> 15:03.882
Besides, Princeton
is in New Jersey,

15:03.884 --> 15:07.318
so it's not like you're
gonna want to stay.

15:12.859 --> 15:15.827
Uh, I know it's
not your birthday,

15:15.829 --> 15:16.794
but if you're
interested...

15:16.796 --> 15:18.429
I am.
Okay.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.467
Oh, and just to be clear,

15:22.469 --> 15:26.137
I'm not being intimate with you
in order to keep you from going.

15:26.139 --> 15:28.106
I wasn't thinking that.

15:28.108 --> 15:30.608
Well, no, it's just, I'm
just warning you, you know,

15:30.610 --> 15:33.011
if you find yourself
3,000 miles away

15:33.013 --> 15:35.780
and craving a-a hit
of this, you know...

15:37.017 --> 15:40.051
...I can't Skype it to you.

15:40.053 --> 15:44.455
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

15:44.457 --> 15:45.990
All right, then.

15:45.992 --> 15:49.994
Let's go to the bedroom,
remove our clothes,

15:49.996 --> 15:51.329
fold them neatly...

15:52.966 --> 15:56.801
...and engage in
frenzied lovemaking.

15:59.506 --> 16:01.973
What if we don't fold
our clothes at all?

16:01.975 --> 16:04.509
I d... or...

16:04.511 --> 16:07.145
what if we fold them?

16:09.349 --> 16:10.648
Well, here's your key back.

16:10.650 --> 16:12.116
Thank you.

16:12.118 --> 16:13.985
As soon as I have the place set
up I'm gonna have you guys over.

16:13.987 --> 16:15.853
Oh, we would love that.

16:15.855 --> 16:17.221
I really can't thank you
enough for taking me in.

16:17.223 --> 16:20.558
You know, I was in a pretty
low place in my life, and...

16:20.560 --> 16:24.495
SHELDON: Oh, Amy,
you naughty vixen.

16:28.501 --> 16:32.070
Anyway, uh,
as I was saying,

16:32.072 --> 16:34.839
I was at a pretty low place
in my life and, uh,

16:34.841 --> 16:36.374
if it wasn't for friends
like you...

16:36.376 --> 16:37.842
AMY: My goodness,
that form of stimulation

16:37.844 --> 16:39.043
is highly efficient.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.883
I can't compete
with that. Bye.

16:48.421 --> 16:50.188
Should we give them
their privacy?

16:50.190 --> 16:53.891
I want to,
but I don't think I can.

16:53.893 --> 16:55.860
SHELDON: Whoopee!
Okay, I'm good now.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.958
Okay, the car is waiting.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.560
Do you want
to walk me downstairs?

17:05.561 --> 17:06.661
Of course.

17:06.663 --> 17:08.296
Here, here, let me.

17:08.298 --> 17:10.565
I've been doing a little
research on New Jersey,

17:10.567 --> 17:12.133
and I was delighted to learn

17:12.135 --> 17:14.368
that their chief
agricultural product

17:14.371 --> 17:16.204
is sod.

17:16.205 --> 17:18.705
- Is it?
- Hmm, yes.

17:18.708 --> 17:23.744
Yeah, perhaps I've been harder
on them than they deserve.

17:23.747 --> 17:25.780
Do you think it's possible

17:25.781 --> 17:29.050
you might enjoy being
on your own for a little while?

17:29.052 --> 17:30.785
It's hard to say.

17:30.787 --> 17:32.787
I've never really lived
by myself.

17:32.789 --> 17:36.257
What if I become
strange and eccentric?

17:40.897 --> 17:42.597
I'll love you no matter what.

17:44.100 --> 17:48.002
Howard Hughes saved his
urine in milk bottles.

17:49.906 --> 17:53.307
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

17:53.309 --> 17:56.004
And you'll text me when
you arrive at the airport?

17:56.028 --> 17:56.845
I will.

17:56.846 --> 17:58.579
- And when you're at the gate?
- Uh-huh.

17:58.581 --> 18:00.281
And if you see any actors
from <i>Game of Thrones</i>

18:00.283 --> 18:02.316
in first class?

18:02.318 --> 18:04.402
I don't know what they
look like, but sure.

18:04.426 --> 18:04.987
Oh.

18:04.988 --> 18:06.983
And don't forget to Skype
me when you arrive.

18:07.007 --> 18:07.623
I won't.

18:07.624 --> 18:09.023
- And every morning.
- Got it.

18:09.025 --> 18:11.259
Now of course, my
9:00 a.m. is your noon,

18:11.261 --> 18:12.827
so let's avoid the
whole "good morning,"

18:12.829 --> 18:13.928
"good afternoon" minefield,

18:13.930 --> 18:15.763
and let's just say,
"Hello."

18:15.765 --> 18:17.698
Good thinking.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.767
And just remember,
I am proud of you

18:19.769 --> 18:22.870
and I support you
in all that you do.

18:22.872 --> 18:24.639
Thank you.
That means a lot.

18:24.641 --> 18:25.907
Oh, and one last thing.

18:25.909 --> 18:28.376
If you find yourself working
with a male scientist

18:28.378 --> 18:32.447
who's as smart as me, as tall
as me and has hair like Thor,

18:32.449 --> 18:35.016
well, then I want you to
step away from the situation

18:35.018 --> 18:36.018
and call me immediately.
