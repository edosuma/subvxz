WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.168
Wow. That's...

00:03.235 --> 00:04.703
He can't carry these
on the bus.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.204
I'll drive him.

00:06.272 --> 00:09.074
Oh, hey, aiden would
real like to have
oatmeal cookies in his--

00:09.141 --> 00:10.508
Yeah, uh-uh.

00:10.576 --> 00:11.676
No. He's going
to be getting

00:11.744 --> 00:13.578
Lots of treats this week
trick or treating.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.747
Oh, hey, remember
I work a double today.

00:15.815 --> 00:17.515
Ok. I've got
plenty of Halloween
decorating to do.

00:17.583 --> 00:18.683
Hmm, that's always fun.

00:18.751 --> 00:21.186
oh!

00:21.254 --> 00:23.421
Hmm.
Hey, you cannot
wear a mask

00:23.489 --> 00:25.056
To school.

00:27.059 --> 00:29.761
Aiden, did you hear me?

00:29.829 --> 00:30.929
Ghouls don't talk.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.998
Oh, ok. Well, then nod.

00:33.065 --> 00:34.332
Ghouls' ears
don't work.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.702
They're decomposed.

00:37.770 --> 00:40.538
all right.

00:40.606 --> 00:42.340
How about you save
the costume for Halloween?

00:42.408 --> 00:44.042
Go on and get changed.
I'm going to take you
and your pumpkins to school.

00:45.611 --> 00:48.179
Ok, aiden, go.
I'll be up in
a minute to help.

00:48.247 --> 00:49.247
Ok, mom.

00:50.783 --> 00:54.019
Mia salter
says frogs are good
and toads are bad,

00:54.086 --> 00:56.554
But I like them both.

00:56.622 --> 00:59.424
And she repeats me
all the time.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.026
I hate that!

01:03.229 --> 01:07.265
It's not a bad word.
It's a feeling word.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.535
Fine, I won't say it.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.171
My mom says the same thing.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.806
Who do you think
is stronger?

01:14.874 --> 01:16.107
This guy,

01:16.175 --> 01:18.176
Or this guy?

01:18.244 --> 01:20.512
One time...
Ghosts?

01:20.579 --> 01:22.614
He's in there alone.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.282
Think it's maybe
some of those friends

01:24.350 --> 01:26.217
Who like to collect
shiny things?

01:26.285 --> 01:27.519
I have no idea.

01:27.586 --> 01:32.023
But this guy
has huge muscles,
and flying powers.

01:32.091 --> 01:33.925
I should probably
take him to school.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.027
I mean, maybe
the teacher knows
something about this.

01:36.095 --> 01:39.664
Wait a minute, he sees ghosts,
he feels what ghosts felt,

01:39.732 --> 01:41.833
But it's imaginary friends
you're worried about?

01:41.901 --> 01:43.802
Aiden doesn't have
imaginary friends.

01:43.869 --> 01:45.670
Uh, until now.

01:45.738 --> 01:48.340
It's normal.
He's normal.

01:48.407 --> 01:49.874
Gifted, but normal.

01:49.942 --> 01:52.277
Look, you're the one
who's going to be late
for the hospital.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.479
It's very nice
that you volunteered
for the blood drive,

01:54.547 --> 01:58.583
But you really belong
in a candy striper's outfit,

01:58.651 --> 01:59.818
You know that?

01:59.885 --> 02:01.453
Do candy stripers
still exist?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.588
Only in my wildest dreams.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.225
All right.
Bye.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.527
No, I haven't
seen aiden talking
to any imaginary friends.

02:10.596 --> 02:11.863
But I'll watch out
for it.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.131
It's good to find out
what kids are into.

02:13.199 --> 02:14.132
Thanks.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.768
Like his ghosts.

02:16.836 --> 02:19.270
You know,
he's an expert
on the topic.

02:19.338 --> 02:20.438
Oh.

02:20.506 --> 02:21.940
He's talked to you
about ghosts.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.575
Not me,
but I hear him

02:23.642 --> 02:25.477
Correcting
his friends, yeah.

02:25.544 --> 02:27.712
Don't worry.
All kids think

02:27.780 --> 02:30.382
They know everything
about something.

02:30.449 --> 02:33.251
I'm sure aiden will
chill on the topic
once the season's over.

02:38.357 --> 02:41.026
Is that too scary?

02:41.093 --> 02:43.395
He's seen worse.

02:43.462 --> 02:46.798
I know.
Some of the decorations
people put out...

02:46.866 --> 02:49.534
Hey, tahsa, let me see
what you're reading.

02:52.271 --> 02:53.705
Did your
older brother
give you this?

02:53.773 --> 02:56.341
Yeah.
I'm gonna keep it, ok?

02:56.409 --> 02:58.143
He's nine,

02:58.210 --> 02:59.411
Which is still
too young,

02:59.478 --> 03:01.012
In my opinion,
for this.
Yeah.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.314
Well, look,
you have your hands full,

03:03.382 --> 03:04.916
So thank you
for taking your time.

03:04.984 --> 03:07.585
Oh, aiden's a great kid,
and it's my job, so...

03:07.653 --> 03:09.387
Oh, speaking of which,

03:09.455 --> 03:11.656
I heard you own
the antique shop
in town.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.024
Yeah. Vintage, antiques.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.627
I have some things
maybe someone could use.

03:15.694 --> 03:17.429
Great. Drop them by anytime.
Ok.

03:17.496 --> 03:19.664
Thanks.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.834
ok.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.335
They can't kiss,
but can they say good-bye?

03:24.403 --> 03:26.471
Bye, mom.
Good-bye.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.074

04:43.883 --> 04:45.884
Child, whispering:
Can you see us?

05:06.805 --> 05:09.807
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

05:18.109 --> 05:20.243
You did a good thing,
giving blood.

05:20.311 --> 05:21.911
You might have
saved a life.

05:21.979 --> 05:24.014
For the record,
I didn't faint.

05:24.081 --> 05:25.615
I just felt a little woozy.

05:25.683 --> 05:27.484
You were very brave.

05:27.551 --> 05:28.585
Well, nothing compared to you.

05:28.653 --> 05:30.353
Facing down some big old
headless horseman.

05:30.421 --> 05:32.555
Well, he's not real.
Needles are.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.190
He was a real ghost,
wasn't he?

05:34.258 --> 05:36.192
Since aiden's been
giving me images
from his dreams,

05:36.260 --> 05:37.594
I'm not sure anymore.

05:37.662 --> 05:38.828
I mean, he felt
like a real ghost.

05:38.896 --> 05:40.997
But didn't you follow it--
them--outside,

05:41.065 --> 05:43.600
Watch it go hi-ho-headless
down the street?

05:43.668 --> 05:44.934
Maybe I was
sleepwalking.

05:45.002 --> 05:46.136
It's happened before.

05:46.203 --> 05:47.971
I mean, aiden had seen
this book at school--

05:48.039 --> 05:49.839
<i>Not the legend
of sleepy hollow?
Yeah!</i>

05:49.907 --> 05:51.341
They're reading that in
kindergarten?

05:51.409 --> 05:52.642
Well, some kid
snuck it in.

05:52.710 --> 05:55.045
It was that same day
that he was talking
to someone.

05:55.112 --> 05:56.880
Someone with a head?
I couldn't see anyone,

05:56.947 --> 05:58.415
But he just kept
talking away.

05:58.482 --> 06:00.950
Well, maybe the ghost vanished
and he didn't notice.

06:01.018 --> 06:03.219
I often keep talking
long after people
have left the room.

06:04.555 --> 06:06.022
Come on, if aiden saw
some headless guy,

06:06.090 --> 06:07.557
Don't you think
he would have
mentioned it to you?

06:07.625 --> 06:09.826
At least say, "mom,
can I have a pony
in the house?"

06:09.894 --> 06:12.395
Ok. So maybe he just
has an imaginary friend

06:12.463 --> 06:13.830
Like every other kid
his age.

06:13.898 --> 06:15.932
And what you saw
is the actual
headless horseman

06:16.000 --> 06:18.968
On the loose in grandview,
in which case,

06:19.036 --> 06:20.003
Hang on to your hats.

06:20.071 --> 06:23.139
Don't lose your head.

06:23.207 --> 06:24.474
Thanks for
the head's up.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.810
Possibilities
are endless.

06:26.877 --> 06:28.845
God, I do feel
a little woozy.

06:30.748 --> 06:32.082
My parents had
a condo in arizona,

06:32.149 --> 06:34.017
So my mom's there
permanently now.

06:34.085 --> 06:35.652
Hey, ms. Mayhew,
how are you?

06:35.720 --> 06:36.686
I'm good.

06:36.754 --> 06:38.054
And please,
call me caroline.

06:38.122 --> 06:39.723
What are you
doing here?

06:39.790 --> 06:41.091
I thought you had
a showing.

06:41.158 --> 06:43.126
No, I got back early,
and then I saw caroline

06:43.194 --> 06:45.228
Almost tip over
with all of these boxes,

06:45.296 --> 06:46.596
So I just let her in.

06:46.664 --> 06:48.665
Delia used
to work with me

06:48.733 --> 06:50.734
Until she opened up
her real estate
business next door.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.202
She told me.

06:52.269 --> 06:54.204
Well, I brought
a bunch of stuff

06:54.271 --> 06:55.805
From my parent"
house.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.942
Wow, this is so beautiful.

06:59.009 --> 07:00.643
Are you sure you want
to get rid of it?

07:00.711 --> 07:03.646
Yeah, my sister
and I went through
everything. We agreed.

07:05.282 --> 07:07.617
My father died
a couple months ago,

07:07.685 --> 07:10.286
So we're trying
to get the house ready
to put on the market.

07:10.354 --> 07:12.722
Oh, look at this. Ha!

07:12.790 --> 07:14.124
Oh, those are
costumes.

07:14.191 --> 07:16.126
We have boxes
of them.

07:16.193 --> 07:18.461
My parents had
this huge Halloween
party every year.

07:18.529 --> 07:20.597
It was...

07:20.664 --> 07:22.932
It was kind of
our thing.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.036
I'm sorry.

07:27.104 --> 07:28.338
Don't be.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.606
Why don't you just let us
take care of the rest?

07:29.673 --> 07:31.641
That would be great.
I should go anyway.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.276
I have a meeting
at school.

07:33.344 --> 07:34.511
Thank you so much.

07:34.578 --> 07:35.678
Sure. I'll call you.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.813
Ok.

07:36.881 --> 07:39.482
Is that a costume,
or did her father ride?

07:39.550 --> 07:40.917
No, no, no,
this box is costumes

07:40.985 --> 07:42.986
And this is all riding gear.

07:43.053 --> 07:44.821
The mayhews
are big horse people.

07:44.889 --> 07:47.090
They have that farm
out on pearson way.

07:54.532 --> 07:55.732
Where's
the barnacle?
Did we lose her?

07:55.800 --> 07:56.966
Shh.

08:02.072 --> 08:05.074
Don't tell me aiden's
teacher is haunted.

08:05.142 --> 08:07.977
Ah, there are memories
attached to these things.

08:08.045 --> 08:10.346
I just don't know
if they connect with
what I saw it last night.

08:10.414 --> 08:12.015
But it was
riding a horse.

08:12.082 --> 08:13.917
It?
A man.

08:13.984 --> 08:16.419
A headless man.

08:16.487 --> 08:19.322
And you're thinking
it's caroline's father?

08:19.390 --> 08:21.191
This is a small town, mel.

08:21.258 --> 08:23.526
If someone were decapitated,
we would have heard about it.

08:23.594 --> 08:25.628
Well, there's gotta be
more to it than that.

08:25.696 --> 08:28.498
Ooh, I would really love
to ask some questions

08:28.566 --> 08:29.866
Before caroline
gets home.

08:29.934 --> 08:31.868
Oh, yeah, go, go.
I'm happy to do it.

08:31.936 --> 08:32.969
Ok, thanks.

08:33.037 --> 08:35.337
Maybe I'll find
a costume in here for me.

08:43.614 --> 08:45.248
Hi.
Hi.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.816
Is this the mayhews?
Yeah, hi.

08:46.884 --> 08:48.318
Can I help you?

08:48.385 --> 08:49.552
My name is
melinda gordon.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.854
I own an antique
store in town,

08:50.921 --> 08:52.555
And I spoke with
caroline today.

08:52.623 --> 08:54.257
Oh, that's my sister.
I'm dana mayhew.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.426
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.827
Um, could we talk
for a second?

08:57.895 --> 08:59.829
Sure. Come on in.
Ok.

09:01.465 --> 09:04.100
So now that mom's
squared away,

09:04.168 --> 09:07.303
Caroline and I thought that
we would tackle the house.

09:07.371 --> 09:09.706
How long have you been
back from the city?

09:09.773 --> 09:12.075
I took two weeks off

09:12.142 --> 09:14.944
To help caroline
organize the house.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.513
You know,
when you're a kid,

09:16.580 --> 09:18.748
You can't wait
to get away, but...

09:18.816 --> 09:21.484
I don't know,
now I miss this place.

09:21.552 --> 09:26.923
I'm not sure if we have
any more pieces of that
particular china set.

09:36.133 --> 09:37.700
Where's
the barnacle?
Did we lose her?

09:37.768 --> 09:39.569
Shh.
Come on.

09:41.639 --> 09:43.773
Dana.

09:43.841 --> 09:46.209
Uh, joel, this is melinda.

09:46.277 --> 09:49.212
Um, caroline
teachers her son.
Oh.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.181
And she's gonna help us
sell some things from
the house at her shop.

09:52.249 --> 09:53.783
This is joel.

09:53.851 --> 09:56.452
He's been a friend
of ours since we were little.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.487
Nice to meet you.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.821
You, too.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.224
Dana was just
telling me
about her family.

10:01.292 --> 10:02.425
Such great people.

10:02.493 --> 10:05.728
Mr. Mayhew was like
a second father to me.

10:05.796 --> 10:09.332
Taught me how
to ride, sail.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.401
It's a shame.

10:13.971 --> 10:17.907
You both look
so young.

10:17.975 --> 10:20.310
Was your father
young, too?

10:20.377 --> 10:22.912
I mean,
was it unexpected?

10:22.980 --> 10:24.080
No.

10:24.148 --> 10:26.316
He had early onset
alzheimer's.

10:26.383 --> 10:29.285
He was sick for a long time
before he died.

10:29.353 --> 10:32.088
You know, there's
more stuff this way.

10:32.156 --> 10:34.090
There's a whole
lifetime worth.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.599
Lots of memories
in this house.

10:42.666 --> 10:45.668
Oh, I think there
might be something
in this box.

10:56.914 --> 10:59.215
Um...

11:00.818 --> 11:03.853
I know that this is
going to sound like
a strange question,

11:03.921 --> 11:06.022
But how did it
affect your father?

11:08.759 --> 11:10.760
The illness, I mean.

11:10.828 --> 11:12.095
It was horrible.

11:12.162 --> 11:14.530
He was delusional,

11:14.598 --> 11:15.832
And that goes
with the territory.

11:15.899 --> 11:17.533
He saw things.

11:17.601 --> 11:19.002
Awful things.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.770
What kind of things?

11:20.838 --> 11:23.940
Twisted images
of the one thing
he loved the most.

11:24.008 --> 11:25.341
The horses?

11:25.409 --> 11:27.343
Yes.

11:30.114 --> 11:33.650
When he got his diagnosis,
he was so angry.

11:33.717 --> 11:36.619
They basically said
he was going to lose his mind.

11:36.687 --> 11:39.789
Can you imagine what
that would feel like?

11:43.460 --> 11:45.962
So the father loved horses
and lost his head to
alzheimer's.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.798
Gabing, gabang,
headless horseman.

11:48.866 --> 11:50.099
You got your ghost.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.601
Ok, but I had a vision

11:51.669 --> 11:53.136
Of the father
seeing the ghost,

11:53.203 --> 11:54.404
Like he was being
haunted by the horseman.

11:54.471 --> 11:57.173
Or a projection
of the man's own fears.

11:57.241 --> 12:00.043
Ok, so is that what's
galloping around town
right now, his fears?

12:00.110 --> 12:01.511
Or his rage.

12:01.578 --> 12:02.612
You said he didn't
take the diagnosis well.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.313
Um, would you?

12:04.381 --> 12:05.415
I expect
to lose my mind

12:05.482 --> 12:06.849
On a daily basis.
I'm a shrink, you know.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.518
ok.
So if dad is our ghost

12:08.585 --> 12:12.221
But he's delusional,
then how do I reach him?

12:12.289 --> 12:13.723
I don't know.
I'm in over my head.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.558
I can't make heads
or tales of it.

12:15.626 --> 12:18.061
<i>Ok, what happened
in sleepy hollow?</i>

12:18.128 --> 12:19.395
Did you read the book?

12:19.463 --> 12:22.265
Yeah. It's basically
the tale of ichabod crane,

12:22.332 --> 12:24.901
This gangly loser
who reaches above
his station.

12:24.968 --> 12:26.436
Above his station?

12:26.503 --> 12:28.037
He likes this pretty girl,

12:28.105 --> 12:30.506
He's head over heels for her,
you might say.

12:30.574 --> 12:32.041
Uh, you might.

12:32.109 --> 12:33.309
Anyway,
she's out of his league.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.178
So the girl's
studly boyfriend

12:35.245 --> 12:37.780
Uses the legend
of the headless horseman
to scare poor ichabod off.

12:37.848 --> 12:39.615
Well, what about
the horseman?

12:39.683 --> 12:41.951
Just some hessian mercenary
who came to a bad end.

12:42.019 --> 12:44.454
See? That's who
I think we should be
looking for.

12:44.521 --> 12:45.988
The rider,
not caroline's father.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.223
Oh, right.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.258
Some invisible dead
german mercenary.

12:49.326 --> 12:50.893
There's a lot of those around.

12:50.961 --> 12:52.962
Have you lost your head?
Say good-night, eli.

13:17.488 --> 13:19.722
I don't know
how it got there.

13:34.945 --> 13:36.446
It was so weird.

13:36.513 --> 13:37.814
You know,
I couldn't move.

13:37.881 --> 13:39.182
It's like everything
was numb.

13:39.249 --> 13:41.350
You're positive
the ghost died
of alzheimer's?

13:41.418 --> 13:42.785
The dad did.

13:42.853 --> 13:44.821
But we don't
even know if he's
the ghost. Why?

13:44.888 --> 13:47.089
Just numb, immobilized.

13:47.157 --> 13:48.324
A steel rod, right?

13:48.392 --> 13:50.693
You know,
in severe spinal injuries,

13:50.761 --> 13:53.162
The head can become completely
detached from the body,

13:53.230 --> 13:54.630
With the skin's
the only thing
holding it on.

13:54.698 --> 13:57.533
I know. What they do
is they insert a steel rod

13:57.601 --> 14:00.002
Into the vertebrae
to reconnect the head.

14:00.070 --> 14:02.138
And someone can
live like that?

14:02.206 --> 14:05.308
For a time. So maybe
your ghost wasn't
technically decapitated,

14:05.375 --> 14:06.843
But lived long enough--

14:06.910 --> 14:09.612
To imagine that
his head and body
are completely separate.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.781
Yeah.

14:11.849 --> 14:14.717
Oh. We know who that is.

14:14.785 --> 14:16.185
Aiden.

14:16.253 --> 14:18.855
I will go.
You stay.

14:27.130 --> 14:29.499
Ah.

14:31.468 --> 14:33.469
Buddy,
what are you doing?

14:33.537 --> 14:36.205
I have to put
my costumes away.

14:36.273 --> 14:37.440
It's the middle
of the night.

14:37.508 --> 14:39.308
I have to.
They don't like them.

14:39.376 --> 14:40.643
Who doesn't
like them?

14:40.711 --> 14:43.246
My friends.

14:45.115 --> 14:49.151
Hey, are your... Friends
here right now?

14:53.023 --> 14:55.391
Hey.

14:55.459 --> 14:56.692
Look.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.561
Talk to me, huh?

14:58.629 --> 15:01.197
What's wrong
with your costumes?

15:01.265 --> 15:03.733
They're bad.
Why?

15:03.800 --> 15:05.167
Because you can't
see inside them.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.270
You can't see
who's wearing them.

15:08.639 --> 15:10.773
You're serious, huh?

15:10.841 --> 15:14.110
I mean, somebody
really told you this?

15:22.286 --> 15:25.488
Honey, you know
it's perfectly normal

15:25.556 --> 15:28.291
For little kids
to both love
and fear Halloween.

15:28.358 --> 15:29.592
He was on a mission.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.427
Jim said it was like
he was taking orders.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.130
Yeah, from his "friends."

15:34.197 --> 15:36.232
You know, maybe
they're just his way

15:36.300 --> 15:37.600
Of getting out of trick
or treating;

15:37.668 --> 15:40.336
An excuse because
the whole concept
is too scary for him.

15:40.404 --> 15:41.637
He's not afraid
of Halloween.

15:41.705 --> 15:43.139
Aiden's a pretty tough kid.

15:43.206 --> 15:45.241
He's... My kid.

15:45.309 --> 15:47.443
Maybe it's
a little scarier

15:47.511 --> 15:49.145
When you know that
ghosts are real.

15:49.212 --> 15:52.248
And are you sure
your headless friend is?

15:52.316 --> 15:53.816
A real ghost,
I mean?

15:53.884 --> 15:55.318
Yeah, he dropped by
last night,

15:55.385 --> 15:57.887
And by dropped,
I mean his head.

15:57.955 --> 15:59.021
What?!

16:01.391 --> 16:02.992
Ok. Here we go.

16:03.060 --> 16:05.895
8 years ago, a worker,
sean flanders,

16:05.963 --> 16:07.597
Was injured
at the mayhew farm,

16:07.664 --> 16:09.432
Thrown from a horse
and broke his neck,
in critical condition.

16:09.499 --> 16:11.033
The horse broke a leg
and was put down.

16:11.101 --> 16:12.668
Sean died almost
a month later.

16:12.736 --> 16:14.503
He was 20 years old.

16:14.571 --> 16:16.339
Caroline must
have known him.

16:16.406 --> 16:17.907
Maybe she knows
why he's haunting
her father

16:17.975 --> 16:18.975
From his deathbed.

16:19.042 --> 16:20.676
Yeah, and why
he's still around.

16:22.446 --> 16:24.680
But she's aiden's
teacher.

16:24.748 --> 16:26.215
What are you going
to tell her?

16:26.283 --> 16:29.318
Anything but,
"aiden's got a weird mom
who can see ghosts."

16:29.386 --> 16:31.454
Yeah.

16:31.521 --> 16:33.656
Thanks so much
for bringing these.

16:33.724 --> 16:35.758
Oh, thanks for helping me
with them, you didn't have to.

16:35.826 --> 16:37.293
Oh, no problem.

16:37.361 --> 16:38.494
We're hitting up
all the parents.

16:38.562 --> 16:39.996
The school's running
low on art supplies

16:40.063 --> 16:41.564
'cause of Halloween.

16:41.632 --> 16:43.733
Uh, look, I brought you
this receipt,

16:43.800 --> 16:44.967
'cause almost
all the costumes

16:45.035 --> 16:46.869
You brought me
have sold already.

16:46.937 --> 16:49.572
Hmm.
Yeah.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.074
You know, people were
really interested

16:52.142 --> 16:54.710
In the equestrian gear.

16:54.778 --> 16:57.179
I don't ride anymore.

16:57.247 --> 17:00.349
So whatever you can get
for it, we'll take it.

17:02.452 --> 17:04.553
Look, I know
about the accident

17:04.621 --> 17:08.089
That happened
at your farm
with that boy.

17:08.157 --> 17:11.060
You're talking
about sean, right?

17:11.127 --> 17:12.694
He wasn't a boy.

17:12.762 --> 17:14.296
Well, I guess he was.

17:14.364 --> 17:16.665
When you're 18,
20 seems a lot older.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.635
Did you know him well?

17:19.703 --> 17:21.904
Yeah, yeah,
we all did.

17:21.972 --> 17:24.807
He had a way of making people
feel close to him.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.009
He drew you in.

17:29.446 --> 17:31.514
He drew me in.

17:31.581 --> 17:34.183
I'm sorry, this is hard
for me to talk about,

17:34.251 --> 17:36.385
Especially after
just losing my father.

17:36.453 --> 17:38.387
Were he and sean close?

17:38.455 --> 17:40.222
No.

17:40.290 --> 17:44.160
My father saw through him
right from the start.

17:44.227 --> 17:46.429
Whoever told you
about the accident

17:46.496 --> 17:48.464
Probably didn't even
know about this

17:48.532 --> 17:49.765
Because we never
pressed charges,

17:49.833 --> 17:52.868
But sean stole from us.

17:52.936 --> 17:55.004
The last thing he took
was my mother's jewelry,

17:55.072 --> 17:57.973
But it probably
wasn't the first.

17:58.041 --> 18:01.043
He was running away
on my father's horse
when he fell.

18:01.111 --> 18:03.579
That's awful.

18:05.215 --> 18:06.449
Can you think
of a reason

18:06.516 --> 18:08.884
Why he would
want to hurt you
and your family?

18:08.952 --> 18:11.587
By stealing from us?

18:11.655 --> 18:14.757
Hey. I'm a little early.

18:15.892 --> 18:17.159
Hello again.

18:17.227 --> 18:20.129
Are you still up for dinner?
Yeah, I'd love to.

18:20.197 --> 18:21.297
I have to come back here
after, though.

18:21.364 --> 18:22.364
I still have a ton of work.

18:22.432 --> 18:23.365
Ok.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.301
I'm sorry,
are we good here?

18:25.368 --> 18:26.736
Yeah.

18:26.803 --> 18:28.804
Let me just
grab my things.

19:31.401 --> 19:32.902
He--hello?

19:32.969 --> 19:35.204
Is anybody here?

19:40.644 --> 19:42.344
Hello?

20:29.793 --> 20:32.828
Who put this...

20:40.270 --> 20:41.570
Sean?

20:49.276 --> 20:51.444
Morning.
Hi.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.279
Thanks for letting me
drop this stuff off
before school.

20:53.347 --> 20:54.547
Sure.

20:54.614 --> 20:57.750
Here. I could have
just come by
your house later.

20:57.818 --> 21:00.353
Uh, actually,

21:00.420 --> 21:02.855
I really wanted
to talk to you
about something.

21:02.923 --> 21:04.724
Ok. Well, do you want
to come in?

21:04.791 --> 21:05.825
Uh, can we just...

21:05.892 --> 21:07.994
Yeah.

21:08.061 --> 21:10.963
Something really weird
happened to me

21:11.031 --> 21:13.032
At the school
last night.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.600
Maybe it's just
Halloween

21:14.668 --> 21:17.570
Or the fact that
I was alone, but...

21:18.972 --> 21:21.574
You didn't feel
like you were alone.

21:21.641 --> 21:24.944
The candle
in the scarecrow's head
lit itself.

21:25.012 --> 21:26.479
That's not
possible, is it?

21:26.546 --> 21:28.681
Shouldn't be.

21:28.749 --> 21:31.917
Why were you
asking me about sean?

21:31.985 --> 21:33.853
It seemed like
you knew something.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.154
Maybe I'm just
crazy, but--

21:35.222 --> 21:37.957
You're not crazy,
but you might think
that I am.

21:40.227 --> 21:43.696
I can see... Ghosts.

21:45.132 --> 21:46.999
I know that's hard
to believe.

21:47.067 --> 21:49.035
Maybe because
of what happened
last night,

21:49.102 --> 21:50.503
It's not so hard
to believe,

21:50.570 --> 21:52.705
But it's fact.
Ok.

21:52.773 --> 21:54.540
Uh, wow.

21:54.608 --> 21:57.076
I know I felt
something around me,

21:57.144 --> 21:59.912
But now, to hear
that it's true...

21:59.980 --> 22:01.247
Yeah.

22:01.314 --> 22:03.015
Does aiden know
what you can do?

22:03.083 --> 22:04.583
He knows.

22:04.651 --> 22:08.120
That must be a hard
thing to explain
to a little boy.

22:09.956 --> 22:13.559
Look, the reason
I was asking questions
about sean

22:13.627 --> 22:15.428
Is because I've seen him.

22:15.495 --> 22:18.531
And I think he might be
haunting your family,

22:18.598 --> 22:21.300
And I just wanted to know
if you had any idea why.

22:21.368 --> 22:23.102
I could take
a wild guess.

22:25.539 --> 22:27.640
Sean and I were
supposed to run away
and get married

22:27.707 --> 22:30.676
The night that
he broke his neck.

22:30.744 --> 22:33.045
My dad hired sean
to help out
at the stables.

22:33.113 --> 22:35.881
I was a senior
in high school
and he was

22:35.949 --> 22:37.883
Technically
a bad boy, I guess.

22:37.951 --> 22:41.087
Took a joy ride
in a car with
some friends,

22:41.154 --> 22:43.089
So he had a record,
but he was sweet.

22:43.156 --> 22:44.557
He was kind.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.892
My dad thought he was
being so charitable,

22:46.960 --> 22:49.228
Giving a break
to a guy like sean.

22:52.999 --> 22:56.202
As long
as he knew his place.

22:56.269 --> 22:59.271
But from the first time
we talked, I thought--

22:59.339 --> 23:02.108
Sean and I both thought
that his place was with me.

23:02.175 --> 23:05.311
When my father found out,
he wanted to fire sean.

23:05.378 --> 23:07.980
I cried in my room
for a week.

23:08.048 --> 23:10.749
My dad let sean stay on,

23:10.817 --> 23:12.852
But we started
sneaking around,

23:12.919 --> 23:15.988
Which just made
things more intense.

23:16.056 --> 23:19.358
We felt like the only
way we could be together
was to elope.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.061
I was 18.

23:22.129 --> 23:24.230
We picked Halloween
because we knew

23:24.297 --> 23:25.764
My parents would be busy
with the party.

23:25.832 --> 23:30.736
It would be hours
before anyone
realized we were gone.

23:30.804 --> 23:32.471
Come on.

23:32.539 --> 23:36.142
I had never been happier
than I was that night.

23:36.209 --> 23:39.912
Carrying that secret.

23:39.980 --> 23:43.516
Standing on the edge
of the rest of my life.

23:43.583 --> 23:46.185
But then...

23:47.320 --> 23:49.388
He didn't come.

23:49.456 --> 23:50.923
I couldn't understand.

23:50.991 --> 23:52.358
And this is how
you repay me?

23:52.425 --> 23:54.260
Until I saw
what was happening
up at the house.

23:54.327 --> 23:56.962
Stealing from me?
Stealing from my wife?

23:57.030 --> 23:59.165
It was sean.

23:59.232 --> 24:01.634
You're wrong!
What's going on?

24:01.701 --> 24:02.735
Caroline!

24:02.802 --> 24:04.069
Where are they?

24:04.137 --> 24:05.704
Give me back
what you've taken!

24:05.772 --> 24:07.406
What?!

24:25.992 --> 24:28.260
He was thrown
less than a mile
from the house.

24:28.328 --> 24:31.564
The fall broke his neck.

24:31.631 --> 24:34.733
They found the jewelry
in his car.

24:37.504 --> 24:39.371
I still keep wondering

24:39.439 --> 24:41.473
What he was thinking--

24:41.541 --> 24:44.243
If he just used me to
get access to the house,

24:44.311 --> 24:46.979
If he really
wanted to marry me.

24:47.047 --> 24:48.647
Did you ask him?

24:49.849 --> 24:52.418
I mean, I read
that he survived
for several weeks.

24:53.687 --> 24:57.022
He was in the hospital,
completely paralyzed,

24:57.090 --> 24:59.024
But I never went
to see him.

25:01.828 --> 25:03.562
Is that why
he's angry with me?

25:03.630 --> 25:06.465
I think he's angry
with your father.

25:06.533 --> 25:08.801
I think he's been
haunting him a long time.

25:08.868 --> 25:10.769
How do you know that?

25:10.837 --> 25:12.271
I get these visions.

25:12.339 --> 25:14.840
ahh!

25:14.908 --> 25:17.409
My father's terrors.

25:17.477 --> 25:18.844
Sometimes,
when a ghost is angry,

25:18.912 --> 25:20.613
They can feel lost,

25:20.680 --> 25:23.515
And they can see
the worst in themselves.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.951
But what more does
he want from us?

25:26.019 --> 25:28.654
He violated our trust.
He stole from us.

25:28.722 --> 25:30.356
Are you sure about that?

25:30.423 --> 25:31.991
Because sean came to me

25:32.058 --> 25:34.426
And he said something
that I didn't really
understand at the time.

25:34.494 --> 25:36.195
What?

25:36.263 --> 25:38.897
"I don't know
how it got there."

25:40.367 --> 25:42.701
Are you sure he's not
talking about the jewelry,

25:42.769 --> 25:44.870
That maybe somebody
planted on him?

25:44.938 --> 25:47.406
I mean, why would you
run away on a horse

25:47.474 --> 25:49.275
If the jewelry
was in the car?

25:49.342 --> 25:51.277
There was a witness.

25:51.344 --> 25:53.912
My sister saw
everything.

25:56.616 --> 25:58.217
Ok, let me
get this straight.

25:58.285 --> 26:01.453
Basically, sean was making out
with caroline one minute,

26:01.521 --> 26:05.157
And then he was
stealing her mother's
jewelry the next.

26:05.225 --> 26:06.625
Sounds bad,
doesn't it?

26:06.693 --> 26:07.693
Uh, yeah.

26:07.761 --> 26:09.995
You know, why was he
so angry with them?

26:10.063 --> 26:13.832
You know? Why was he
haunting people
who he had wronged?

26:13.900 --> 26:16.168
Maybe he hated
her old man

26:16.236 --> 26:17.836
For thinking
he wasn't good enough.

26:19.773 --> 26:21.874
You're not thinking
he's innocent?

26:21.941 --> 26:23.742
The sister saw
the whole thing.

26:23.810 --> 26:25.577
Well, there were
so many people
at the party that night,

26:25.645 --> 26:28.580
And everybody
was in costumes.

26:28.648 --> 26:30.416
Wait a minute.

26:31.718 --> 26:33.719
The bad thing
about costumes

26:33.787 --> 26:35.888
Is that you don't know
who's inside them.

26:35.955 --> 26:37.589
Excuse me?

26:37.657 --> 26:39.892
Well, that's what
aiden's "friends" told him.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.994
Ok, you're not letting
sean off the hook

26:42.062 --> 26:44.596
Because of something
one of aiden's
imaginary friends said?

26:44.664 --> 26:46.598
No, but it was
a costume party.

26:46.666 --> 26:49.401
I mean, maybe
caroline's sister
was confused.

26:56.609 --> 26:58.610
Hey, where's the barnacle?
We lose her?

26:58.678 --> 27:00.245
Shh!

27:00.313 --> 27:02.214
Come on.

27:07.220 --> 27:09.888
Are you sure
you want to do this?

27:09.956 --> 27:13.292
I want to marry you.
Tonight.

27:20.166 --> 27:21.800
Did you see
something?

27:21.868 --> 27:23.469
Yeah.

27:23.536 --> 27:26.238
Caroline and sean.

27:26.306 --> 27:29.675
Um, through a mask
like this one.

27:29.743 --> 27:31.243
That's dana.

27:31.311 --> 27:33.078
She saw sean
and her sister talking.

27:33.146 --> 27:36.215
They were talking about
getting married.

27:36.282 --> 27:39.418
Caroline said that he had this
way of drawing you in,

27:39.486 --> 27:41.987
And dana, she must have been
what, 12 or 13?

27:42.055 --> 27:43.989
I mean,
that's prime crush age.

27:44.057 --> 27:47.159
You think she lied
to bust them up?

27:47.227 --> 27:48.794
If she did, it worked.

27:50.330 --> 27:53.866
And now sean
is haunting all
the wrong people.

28:05.478 --> 28:06.912
Whoa!

28:06.980 --> 28:08.514
Whoa, boy.

28:10.316 --> 28:12.618
Careful, dana.

28:12.685 --> 28:15.354
Whoa, easy, boy.
Easy, easy.

28:20.493 --> 28:22.795
Aah!

28:29.151 --> 28:30.485
Hey.
Hey.

28:30.553 --> 28:31.920
How's caroline's
sister?

28:31.988 --> 28:33.121
Did you check
on her?
Yeah.

28:33.189 --> 28:35.457
She's ok. A concussion,
dislocated shoulder,

28:35.524 --> 28:37.258
But otherwise, she's fine.

28:37.326 --> 28:38.493
And caroline's
waiting for you.

28:38.561 --> 28:39.761
Ok. Aiden's
at the mcallisters.

28:39.829 --> 28:41.262
Do whatever
you need to do.

28:41.330 --> 28:42.897
I'm off, ok? I'll get him
ready for trick or treating.

28:42.965 --> 28:43.898
Ok.

28:43.966 --> 28:45.133
Bye.
Bye.

28:47.937 --> 28:49.104
Hey.

28:49.171 --> 28:50.839
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming.

28:50.906 --> 28:52.073
Yeah, of course.

28:52.141 --> 28:54.275
She said the horse
just went crazy.

28:54.343 --> 28:55.910
Could sean
have done this to her?

28:55.978 --> 28:57.145
It's possible.

28:57.213 --> 28:58.613
I mean, he's been
haunting the house
for years,

28:58.681 --> 28:59.948
And animals have
heightened senses.

29:00.016 --> 29:02.684
I mean, I have seen them
react to ghosts before.

29:02.752 --> 29:03.952
Can I talk to dana?

29:04.020 --> 29:05.620
Yeah, I hope you don't mind.

29:05.688 --> 29:07.255
I told her
what you can do.

29:08.491 --> 29:10.792
I think sean's still angry

29:10.860 --> 29:12.961
About what happened
that night.

29:13.029 --> 29:15.930
I just told
my mother
what I saw.

29:15.998 --> 29:17.665
That must have been
hard for you,

29:17.733 --> 29:19.367
Considering
how you felt about him.

29:19.435 --> 29:21.770
Did caroline
tell you that?

29:21.837 --> 29:24.372
In a way.

29:26.175 --> 29:29.511
I guess you could say
he was my first love.

29:29.578 --> 29:32.113
After skateboards
and barbie dolls.

29:32.181 --> 29:34.783
I'm sure he knew.

29:34.850 --> 29:36.151
I'm sure everybody knew.

29:36.218 --> 29:38.920
I was 12.

29:38.988 --> 29:41.523
He didn't pay much
attention to me.

29:41.590 --> 29:43.625
He was in love
with your sister.

29:43.692 --> 29:44.826
Yeah.

29:44.894 --> 29:46.294
There was that.

29:46.362 --> 29:50.165
Wherever sean went,
caroline followed,

29:50.232 --> 29:54.302
With some lame
excuse about where
she was going.

29:54.370 --> 29:55.670
But you knew
what was going on.

29:55.738 --> 29:59.040
Well, I was old
enough to understand
they were a couple...

30:00.776 --> 30:03.378
But too young
to understand

30:03.446 --> 30:06.881
Why he couldn't just as
easily have chosen me.

30:06.949 --> 30:08.483
That night at the party,

30:08.551 --> 30:11.886
I decided that I would be
the one to follow him.

30:14.824 --> 30:16.157
I don't know
what I was thinking

30:16.225 --> 30:18.359
Or what I thought
would happen.

30:18.427 --> 30:20.095
But you only saw him
from behind?

30:20.162 --> 30:21.529
It was him.

30:21.597 --> 30:22.931
How did you know?

30:22.998 --> 30:24.432
Because of the way
he walked.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.568
He'd been thrown
the day before.

30:26.635 --> 30:27.936
He twisted
his ankle.

30:28.003 --> 30:31.072
He let me put
the bandage on it.
He was limping.

30:52.795 --> 30:54.929
I wish I had never
followed him.

30:54.997 --> 30:57.065
I wish I had never
seen anything.

30:57.133 --> 31:00.268
But that's not all you saw.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.470
You saw he and caroline
making their plans.

31:02.538 --> 31:04.439
What plans?

31:04.507 --> 31:06.641
They were going to elope.

31:06.709 --> 31:08.243
What?

31:08.310 --> 31:11.045
You didn't know?

31:11.113 --> 31:13.014
No.

31:14.083 --> 31:16.151
Wait a minute.

31:21.157 --> 31:23.658
This is you.

31:23.726 --> 31:24.792
Isn't it?

31:24.860 --> 31:26.427
I mean, this is the mask
that you were wearing

31:26.495 --> 31:27.762
At the party?

31:30.833 --> 31:34.169
Before the party,
sean was teasing me
about my costume.

31:34.236 --> 31:35.436
That's not
even spooky.

31:35.504 --> 31:38.740
He said it was lame
because it wasn't scary,

31:38.807 --> 31:40.508
It wasn't even
a disguise.

31:40.576 --> 31:43.444
So joel let me
borrow his mask.

31:43.512 --> 31:45.413
Can I have your mask, please?

31:45.481 --> 31:46.915
Here.

31:46.982 --> 31:49.317
Joel was always around.
He treated me like
a kid sister.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.085
So this is joel's mask?

31:51.153 --> 31:52.420
Yeah.

31:52.488 --> 31:54.355
He had been
wearing it
the whole night.

32:00.362 --> 32:02.597
joel.

32:02.665 --> 32:04.832
Hi.

32:04.900 --> 32:07.268
I don't understand
what a mask has to do
with anything.

32:07.336 --> 32:09.137
A lot, actually.

32:09.205 --> 32:11.139
It may have lead
to someone's death.

32:13.075 --> 32:15.343
You're talking about sean.

32:15.411 --> 32:16.978
I'm sure
whatever you did,

32:17.046 --> 32:19.280
You had no idea
where it would end.

32:22.218 --> 32:24.786
They called dana
"the barnacle."

32:24.853 --> 32:26.154
Can I have your mask, please?

32:26.222 --> 32:27.222
Look, not now, dana.

32:27.289 --> 32:29.657
Come on, joel!
You don't really need it.

32:29.725 --> 32:31.226
That night, I saw
why she wanted my mask,

32:31.293 --> 32:33.661
And she wouldn't
take no for an answer.

32:33.729 --> 32:35.530
Because sean
had teased her
about her costume.

32:35.598 --> 32:37.832
I was just trying
to get rid of her.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.068
I had other things
on my mind.

32:40.135 --> 32:41.636
Because you had seen
sean and caroline

32:41.704 --> 32:43.171
And you knew
about their plans?

32:43.239 --> 32:45.473
Yeah.

32:45.541 --> 32:47.609
I saw caroline
go off on her own.

32:47.676 --> 32:49.310
It seemed like
a good chance to talk.

32:49.378 --> 32:51.212
Are you sure
you want to do this?

32:51.280 --> 32:53.348
Are you?
Yes.

32:53.415 --> 32:54.916
I want to marry you.

32:54.984 --> 32:57.252
Tonight.

33:00.089 --> 33:01.823
You wanted
to stop them.

33:01.890 --> 33:03.157
He was a dropout.

33:03.225 --> 33:04.525
He had a record.

33:04.593 --> 33:06.027
And you used that.
I didn't have to.

33:06.095 --> 33:08.930
All I did was
tell their father
what I overheard.

33:08.998 --> 33:11.833
I didn't do it
to hurt anyone.

33:11.900 --> 33:14.035
She was 18.

33:14.103 --> 33:16.237
Wouldn't you want to know
if your kid was running off?

33:17.539 --> 33:19.040
And then
what happened?

33:20.175 --> 33:23.011
Uh, he told me
to go home.

33:23.078 --> 33:25.713
He said not to worry,
that he'd handle it.

33:27.950 --> 33:29.617
I never thought
to ask how.

33:32.021 --> 33:35.256
when I woke up
the next morning,

33:35.324 --> 33:37.692
Sean was out of their lives.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.928
And you still hung
around the family.

33:40.996 --> 33:44.499
I was waiting
for caroline...

33:44.566 --> 33:47.135
To get over him.

33:50.539 --> 33:52.907
I guess I still am.

33:58.414 --> 34:00.982
How could the father
frame the boyfriend?

34:01.050 --> 34:02.216
There was a witness.

34:02.284 --> 34:04.385
Yeah, who didn't
see his face.

34:04.453 --> 34:07.789
Yeah, well, how did he
get sean's costume from him?

34:07.856 --> 34:10.425
Or did they just happen
to be wearing the same one?

34:10.492 --> 34:12.592
Well, that was no
accident, either.

34:12.661 --> 34:14.161
There was a sign

34:14.228 --> 34:15.330
For people
at the party

34:15.397 --> 34:16.998
Who didn't
wear costumes.

34:48.429 --> 34:49.764
Her father didn't
realize that dana

34:49.831 --> 34:52.233
Was following him
through the party.

34:53.768 --> 34:55.570
It was perfect.

35:00.576 --> 35:03.044
"I don't know
how it got there."

35:03.112 --> 35:04.345
You meant
the jewelry.

35:04.413 --> 35:06.614
I didn't know
who put it there.

35:06.682 --> 35:08.883
Not at that time.

35:08.951 --> 35:11.486
I know her father
hated me.

35:11.553 --> 35:14.355
He hated anything
he couldn't control.

35:14.423 --> 35:16.958
Why didn't you just
tell me you were innocent?

35:17.025 --> 35:18.893
How was I supposed
to prove it?

35:18.961 --> 35:21.062
But now...

35:22.131 --> 35:24.565
Ready to go
on the hay ride?

35:24.633 --> 35:26.067
Here, let me
help you out.

35:26.135 --> 35:28.202
There, you're all set.
- Yeah, I'm ready.

35:28.270 --> 35:30.905
We have to tell caroline.

35:32.341 --> 35:33.608
No, not now.

35:33.675 --> 35:35.643
There's
too much going on.

35:35.711 --> 35:36.978
She has to know.

35:37.045 --> 35:39.647
Sean, wait!

35:42.351 --> 35:44.185
Sean! Wait!

35:44.253 --> 35:46.521
Here, let me fix that for you.
Thanks.

35:46.588 --> 35:47.755
You ready? They're ready.

35:47.823 --> 35:49.857
Yeah.

35:59.601 --> 36:02.470
Oh, my god, jessica!

36:04.506 --> 36:05.940
No!

36:06.008 --> 36:08.009
jessica!

36:09.445 --> 36:11.779
Hold on, jessica!

36:11.847 --> 36:14.615
Oh, my god!

36:17.659 --> 36:19.494
oh, my god, jessica!

36:24.566 --> 36:27.735
Sean, stop them!

36:27.803 --> 36:29.403
Stop it!
You're doing this!

36:29.471 --> 36:31.038
Aiden, stay with me!

36:31.106 --> 36:32.173
Jim! Aiden, stay here.
Aiden, stay here

36:32.241 --> 36:33.307
With your mom,
I'm gonna go help.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.820
Whoa, easy girl,
whoa. You're ok.

36:53.862 --> 36:55.463
Everyone all right?
I got you.

36:57.199 --> 36:58.666
You ok, little
angel? You ok?
Yeah.

37:13.715 --> 37:16.551
I can't believe
my father would
do all that,

37:16.618 --> 37:18.986
Just to keep us
from being together.

37:19.054 --> 37:22.423
Well, he probably thought
that he was protecting you.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.792
But there's something
I don't understand.

37:24.860 --> 37:27.929
If sean was innocent,
why did he run?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.764
Why didn't he
defend himself?

37:29.831 --> 37:31.799
I wanted to.

37:31.867 --> 37:33.501
There was a witness.

37:33.569 --> 37:34.835
He's here.

37:34.903 --> 37:37.004
He wanted
to fight for you,

37:37.072 --> 37:40.007
But he thought it was hopeless
because there was a witness.

37:40.075 --> 37:42.810
But he could have
talked to me.

37:42.878 --> 37:44.412
I would have
believed him.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.614
That's not what was
in her eyes.

37:46.682 --> 37:48.816
What do you mean?

37:48.884 --> 37:54.222
The way she looked at me,
her eyes...

37:55.490 --> 37:56.791
Her father, he--

37:56.858 --> 37:58.960
He looked at me like
I was some sort of
charity case,

37:59.027 --> 37:59.961
You know, someone
who was just going

38:00.028 --> 38:01.329
To take something from him.

38:01.396 --> 38:04.832
I guess he was right.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.635
From the moment we met,
I felt like she saw me.

38:07.703 --> 38:09.136
You know, a better me.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.440
Someone I could be,
not just the mistakes I made.

38:12.507 --> 38:16.477
He saw the best version
of himself in your eyes.

38:18.747 --> 38:20.715
Till that night.

38:20.782 --> 38:22.650
That night,
she looked at me

38:22.718 --> 38:24.318
Like I was a thief.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.188
If caroline doubted me,

38:27.256 --> 38:29.523
Who was going to believe me?

38:29.591 --> 38:31.025
What was I going
to fight for?

38:32.561 --> 38:35.997
She was everything to me.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.165
So I ran.

38:38.233 --> 38:40.601
When he saw you
doubting him,

38:40.669 --> 38:43.871
He felt like
he'd lost everything.

38:46.174 --> 38:48.876
I'm so sorry
I left you there.

38:50.879 --> 38:53.114
All those weeks
in the hospital...

38:53.181 --> 38:54.849
How could you know?

38:54.916 --> 38:56.384
Your father tricked you.

38:56.451 --> 38:58.753
What about my father?

38:58.820 --> 39:00.855
His spirit?

39:00.922 --> 39:02.056
How could he do
what he did

39:02.124 --> 39:03.958
And still find
peace?

39:04.026 --> 39:05.993
Is he here, too?

39:06.061 --> 39:08.062
No.

39:08.130 --> 39:09.997
He's gone.

39:10.065 --> 39:12.166
Did you see him
go into the light?

39:12.234 --> 39:16.671
Part of him
was drawn to the light.

39:16.738 --> 39:19.407
Part of him wasn't.

39:19.474 --> 39:21.375
What does that mean?

39:21.443 --> 39:23.444
Did he cross over?

39:25.280 --> 39:27.048
He's gone.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.617
I saw him leave.

39:33.689 --> 39:36.657
Your father is gone.

39:48.403 --> 39:50.671
Is that for me?

40:01.383 --> 40:04.318
I loved you.

40:04.386 --> 40:07.488
I always will.

40:07.556 --> 40:09.056
That's it.

40:13.228 --> 40:15.162
That's the way
she used to look at me.

40:47.729 --> 40:49.830
You know, we should at least
hear what eli has to say.

40:49.898 --> 40:51.399
He is a professional,
after all.

40:51.466 --> 40:53.334
Hey, can't we just let
him have his friends?

40:53.402 --> 40:54.769
I just want
to understand it.

40:54.836 --> 40:56.504
I mean, they knew
about my ghost.

40:56.571 --> 40:59.306
They knew that
sean's costume
was part of a lie.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.008
Aiden's gifted.

41:01.076 --> 41:03.310
Maybe his friends
didn't tell him anything
he doesn't already know.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.713
Yeah, maybe.

41:07.616 --> 41:09.650
All right,
what aren't you
telling me?

41:09.718 --> 41:12.953
It's just, at first,
I thought it was
about Halloween.

41:13.021 --> 41:16.023
You know, his fears,
his need to be comforted
by these friends.

41:16.091 --> 41:19.460
What if it's not the holiday?
What if it's the season?

41:19.528 --> 41:20.694
Season?

41:20.762 --> 41:22.997
<i>The book of changes.</i>

41:24.266 --> 41:26.267
It says,
"when the leaves fall,
so will the innocent."

41:28.937 --> 41:30.337
Look...

41:30.405 --> 41:33.374
Maybe the book
meant your headless
horseman ghost, right?

41:33.442 --> 41:35.242
He turned out to be
innocent.

41:35.310 --> 41:36.477
It's not about a ghost.

41:36.545 --> 41:39.180
The entry was right next
to aiden's name.

41:39.247 --> 41:41.816
You know, carl said
that aiden

41:41.883 --> 41:43.250
Would have powers
that I don't.

41:43.318 --> 41:45.052
What if that means
seeing things that I can't,

41:45.120 --> 41:46.353
Things that are real?

41:49.224 --> 41:50.257
Hey.

41:50.325 --> 41:51.459
Hey, buddy.

41:51.526 --> 41:53.227
How you doin'?

41:53.295 --> 41:55.362
Did you have a good
little chat with uncle eli?

41:55.430 --> 41:56.397
Hmm?

41:56.465 --> 41:58.365
We had a great talk,
didn't we?

41:58.433 --> 42:01.902
Aiden, tell your mom
and dad what you
were telling me.

42:03.071 --> 42:05.339
Tell them why
your friend's shy.

42:05.407 --> 42:08.108
Because they don't
have faces.

42:10.445 --> 42:11.612
They're made of light.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.548
That sounds--
that sounds pretty.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.050
Are they nice?

42:16.117 --> 42:19.086
Mm-hmm.
But they're scared.

42:19.154 --> 42:21.822
What are they scared of,
buddy?

42:21.890 --> 42:23.624
Of the shadows.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.528
Like the shadows
that are in
your closet at night?

42:27.596 --> 42:29.029
No, silly.

42:29.097 --> 42:30.764
<i>Not those shadows.</i>

42:30.832 --> 42:32.566
The shadows that move.

42:32.634 --> 42:35.202
What kind of shadows
are those?

42:35.270 --> 42:38.105
The ones they make
from the parts that
get left behind.

42:39.641 --> 42:40.774
Parts of what?

42:40.842 --> 42:43.344
People. Broken people.

42:46.214 --> 42:47.982
Hey, ok.

42:48.049 --> 42:49.316
Let's go get dinner
ready, huh?

42:49.384 --> 42:51.719
You're gonna be
my sous chef,
right, buddy?

42:58.059 --> 43:01.228
Sean said right
before he crossed over

43:01.296 --> 43:03.130
That part of
caroline's father

43:03.198 --> 43:04.598
Was drawn to the light
and part wasn't.

43:04.666 --> 43:05.966
Is that what he meant?

43:06.034 --> 43:09.069
That only parts of them
go into the light?

43:09.137 --> 43:11.005
Is that possible?

43:11.072 --> 43:12.840
I don't know.

43:12.908 --> 43:15.676
I've never seen what
happens once they get
towards the light.

43:15.744 --> 43:18.112
So a spirit can
split itself
into 2 parts?

43:18.179 --> 43:20.514
Maybe that's not
how it happens.

43:20.582 --> 43:22.182
Maybe it's just like
aiden said.

43:22.250 --> 43:26.086
Maybe some people
are just... Broken.
