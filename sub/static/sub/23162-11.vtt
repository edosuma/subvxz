WEBVTT

00:03.621 --> 00:05.567
I'm telling you, he was there.

00:05.623 --> 00:06.931
The boy from Atlantis.

00:06.991 --> 00:09.403
Smiling and waving
at old Uncle Thomas.

00:09.460 --> 00:12.964
Until you showed up, I'd almost
gotten used to not seeing Keli'i.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.243
Keli'i Parker led you
to this Corsair

00:18.302 --> 00:21.340
so you could find whoever
is responsible for his murder?

00:21.472 --> 00:24.749
Thomas! Jeez. You could've
gotten us killed.

00:24.809 --> 00:27.881
He found you.
Don't let him down.

02:03.157 --> 02:07.936
<i>There's something very soothing, almost
mystical, about the world under the sea.</i>

02:07.995 --> 02:10.100
<i>I've always felt drawn to it.</i>

02:10.163 --> 02:12.124
<i>And even though T.C. and I
had learned to identify</i>

02:12.166 --> 02:15.045
<i>all kinds of sea life over the
years we'd been diving together,</i>

02:15.703 --> 02:18.411
<i>each time had its own surprises.</i>

06:32.626 --> 06:34.628
You're drifting, Magnum.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.003
Okay!

06:41.402 --> 06:44.246
Slightly higher. The holes
must be properly aligned.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.879
Honestly, Magnum, if you can't see the
markings, perhaps you'd better let T.C. do it.

06:48.943 --> 06:50.752
I can see the markings.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.085
Oh, yeah, there's nothing
wrong with his vision. T.C.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.388
Unless you want to count seeing
things that aren't there.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.963
I'm telling you he was there.
Who was where?

06:58.018 --> 06:59.258
Nobody.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.731
The boy from Atlantis.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.856
Oh, him.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.493
Look, T.C., I'm not so sure
Rick and Higgins

07:04.558 --> 07:06.094
are real interested
in hearing about this.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.609
Swimming 100 feet down,
no scuba,

07:10.664 --> 07:13.804
no air, just smiling and
waving at old Uncle Thomas.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.540
He wasn't waving.
He was gesturing.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.877
He wasn't there.

07:16.937 --> 07:21.408
I'm afraid I must agree with T.C. At
16 fathoms, it would be impossible.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.284
I know it seems impossible.

07:23.344 --> 07:26.154
You merely experienced an
episode of nitrogen narcosis,

07:26.213 --> 07:28.090
more commonly referred
to as "the rapture."

07:28.148 --> 07:31.288
Please don't talk to me about diving,
Higgins. I've done it all my adult life.

07:31.352 --> 07:34.231
I know what the rapture is,
but I also know what I saw.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.995
That's precisely what
Lieutenant Crossley said

07:36.056 --> 07:38.229
when we pulled him from
the Gulf of Martaban.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.086
We removed his diving helmet, he
immediately started babbling on about

07:41.128 --> 07:43.438
the beautiful women he'd seen
living beneath the sea.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.376
I believe "Sirens" was
the term he used.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.971
No kidding. Where is
this Gulf of Martaban?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.517
I'm not talking about a mermaid.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.075
Neither was he.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.917
Lieutenant Crossley claimed he
saw an entire city of them,

07:56.977 --> 07:58.854
including a caravan
of elephants.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.052
No elephants, Higgins.
No cities and no mermaids.

08:02.116 --> 08:03.561
Yeah, just one little kid.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.858
Yeah. One little kid,
and he was real.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.762
Yes, of course he was.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.195
Delicately. Delicately. You don't
want to splinter the wood.

08:18.299 --> 08:20.370
All right, Higgins.

08:20.668 --> 08:24.514
Storeroom cleaned out, books brought
upstairs from the den, moose head mounted...

08:24.571 --> 08:25.914
It's a keg buffalo.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.143
Any more urgent chores?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.210
No, no. I think that will
take care of it.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.278
Good.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.616
Later, Higgie.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.754
Higgins, where's the
Gulf of Martaban?

09:48.155 --> 09:51.227
Thomas! Thomas!

09:52.426 --> 09:55.498
Jeez. Where the hell are you at, man?
You could've gotten us killed.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.633
I'm sorry, Rick.
I didn't see him.

09:58.132 --> 10:00.476
Hey, look. You want to
daydream, let me drive.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.138
No, I'm fine. Really.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.846
You know, I used to date this
girl that used to read dreams.

10:07.508 --> 10:09.317
She kind of interpreted them.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.050
She told me that daydreaming
was really something special

10:12.112 --> 10:14.058
because it was
close to the conscious mind.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.718
I wasn't daydreaming, Rick.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.294
No? Then, what would
you call it?

10:18.352 --> 10:21.458
I mean, you see this kid on the
freeway, you see him underwater.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.501
Look, maybe there's something weird
stuck in your subconscious mind.

10:25.559 --> 10:29.371
Maybe, just maybe, she could help you figure
out what this fantasy kid represents.

10:29.430 --> 10:31.341
Look, Rick. The kid is real.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.605
I don't need help
with my subconscious.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.546
What I need is help finding out
who he is and why he needs me.

10:36.603 --> 10:37.673
Okay, okay.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.718
I thought that's why we were going
to see this friend of yours.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.014
It is. Look,
I know Wesley can help us.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.522
He's been with the newspaper for 12 years.
He knows every family on the Island.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.752
He's an investigative
reporter, right?

10:47.815 --> 10:49.385
Yeah. Something like that.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.632
I just wrote
my 20,00oth obituary.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.928
You write obituaries?

10:55.989 --> 10:59.664
And that breaks the Press Telegram's
old record set in '58 by Max Mitchell.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.103
That's great!
Isn't that great, Thomas?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.265
Yeah. It's terrific.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.036
Hey, did you win a trophy
or something?

11:04.097 --> 11:07.271
I'm not in it for the trophies.
Okay, I got one for you.

11:07.334 --> 11:12.977
Born August 12th, 1923.
Died April 4th, 1978.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.246
No runs, no hits, no errors.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.409
Um, uh...

11:15.476 --> 11:16.750
Johnny Matthews, the shortstop.

11:16.810 --> 11:22.886
Okay, okay. Born December 3rd, 1948.
Died May 1st, 1980.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.293
Stepped on the gas
instead of the brake.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.831
Stepped on the gas
and not the brakes.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.627
Wayne Makini,
the racecar driver.

11:28.555 --> 11:31.764
You're good. You ever consider
getting into this line of work?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.031
Makini. I should've had
that one.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.595
You know, it's amazing
the stories you run into

11:34.661 --> 11:36.368
doing the kind of writing I do.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.569
Take your request, for example.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.476
I cross-indexed every known
death at the Kahuku Lagoon,

11:41.535 --> 11:44.914
computer gave me 22 different items.
That's 22 different stories.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.477
I categorized them for you.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.113
Natural causes, accidental
and unexplained.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.292
What exactly does
unexplained cover?

11:54.815 --> 11:57.227
Probably what you've been
seeing in your dreams.

11:59.753 --> 12:03.667
Unexplained means that the current got
the corpse before the coroner did.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.432
You know, the ocean has
its little secrets.

12:06.493 --> 12:12.808
I got one for you. "One if
by land, two if by Big C."

12:12.866 --> 12:15.244
Admiral Gus Delmore.
That's an old one.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.303
Oh.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.147
Any luck?

12:18.705 --> 12:19.706
Thomas?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.617
That's him.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.322
That's the boy in Kahuku Lagoon.

12:37.957 --> 12:41.928
<i>For me, the morning paper has
always been an hour with the sports section</i>

12:41.994 --> 12:44.941
<i>or maybe the comics over
a nice, hot cup of coffee.</i>

12:44.997 --> 12:48.843
<i>I never could figure people who started
the day with the obituary page.</i>

12:48.901 --> 12:52.246
<i>But talking to Rick's friend, Wesley,
made me consider that obituaries</i>

12:52.304 --> 12:54.807
<i>were as much about life
as death.</i>

12:54.873 --> 12:58.286
<i>A condensed version of dreams,
achievements and loved ones.</i>

12:59.078 --> 13:01.991
<i>And maybe in this case,
a starting point to find out</i>

13:02.047 --> 13:05.927
<i>why a life had ended before the dreams
and achievements could be fulfilled.</i>

13:07.619 --> 13:12.329
<i>I didn't know how or why Keli'i Parker's
death had crossed over into my life.</i>

13:12.391 --> 13:16.168
<i>But I knew he was going to be with me
day and night until I found out why.</i>

13:16.895 --> 13:18.340
Mrs. Parker?

13:18.397 --> 13:19.398
Yes?

13:19.898 --> 13:22.469
Uh, could I talk to you
for a minute?

13:22.534 --> 13:25.606
Your child's having a problem
with playground etiquette?

13:25.671 --> 13:26.877
No, uh...

13:31.210 --> 13:33.554
I'd like to talk to you
about your son, Keli'i.

13:36.782 --> 13:37.783
Who are you?

13:39.018 --> 13:41.362
My name is Thomas Magnum.
I'm a private investigator.

13:41.420 --> 13:45.493
Look, we settled with the insurance
company a long time ago.

13:45.557 --> 13:49.437
Why don't you people just
go away and leave us alone?

13:49.495 --> 13:51.998
Mrs. Parker, please. I'm
not going to talk to you.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.441
I've seen your son.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.583
At least, I think I have.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.587
This morning, at Kahuku
Lagoon, I was diving...

14:06.512 --> 14:07.991
I know this sounds crazy.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.391
But even though I know
he couldn't have been there...

14:10.449 --> 14:13.760
He gestured to you,
to come closer.

14:16.221 --> 14:20.761
I used to see him every night.
In my dreams.

14:20.826 --> 14:24.000
He was underwater.
Swimming. Happy.

14:25.597 --> 14:27.440
He wanted to show me something.

14:28.801 --> 14:29.939
Just out of sight.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.078
At first, I'd wake up scared.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.917
Then I started sleeping
all the time,

14:39.978 --> 14:44.757
so that I could be with him. I even went
diving once to see if I could find him.

14:46.785 --> 14:51.825
Working here, gradually,
I started to wake up.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.093
Finally,

14:56.462 --> 14:57.998
he quit coming to me.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.064
Ilima?

14:59.998 --> 15:01.170
Stephen.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.803
You ready to go home?

15:03.268 --> 15:07.580
Mr. Magnum, this is my husband, Stephen.
Honey, he's an investigator.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.379
We don't need any more
questions, Mr. Magnum.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.885
We've put the past behind us.

15:12.945 --> 15:13.980
Well, I can understand
how you feel...

15:14.046 --> 15:16.151
No. I don't think you can.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.752
I'd appreciate it if you'd
stay away from my wife.

15:55.053 --> 15:57.932
Shirley, what about the C-46?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.831
Well, Willy says if he stays
up the whole night

15:59.858 --> 16:02.304
and they put a few
extra mechanics on the job,

16:02.361 --> 16:04.841
it ought to pass muster
by tomorrow noon.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.741
Think we can put off the
inspection for just one more day?

16:07.799 --> 16:10.075
Hi, uh... Hi, F.A.A.?

16:10.135 --> 16:13.582
What? You're the examiner
from the F.A.A.?

16:14.072 --> 16:15.142
Right.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.515
Great. Harry Granger.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.586
Why don't we just get
right into the paperwork?

16:19.645 --> 16:23.149
You know, safety records,
maintenance reports, uh,

16:23.215 --> 16:25.855
get all that out of the way
before we get into the aircraft.

16:25.918 --> 16:26.919
Sure.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.431
Well, uh... Great. Follow me.

16:31.156 --> 16:34.729
I think you're going to find everything
you're going to need right in here.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.205
Here we go.

16:38.263 --> 16:39.640
Quite an operation here.

16:39.698 --> 16:42.076
Yeah, well, we work at it.

16:43.001 --> 16:46.141
You know, uh, I remember when this
place used to be Moku Charters.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.082
You really expanded, huh?

16:48.740 --> 16:53.519
I'll say. You know, we've got
records going back here five years.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.718
That's when we took
over this operation.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.354
By the way, how far back do
you want to go?

16:58.417 --> 17:01.864
Well, how about
right at the top?

17:02.087 --> 17:05.500
You know, I never figured
that old guy,

17:05.557 --> 17:07.763
Kalihi, to be
the type to retire.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.807
Now that should do you
for starters.

17:13.965 --> 17:14.967
Damn.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.401
Problem?

17:16.768 --> 17:17.906
My calculator.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.506
Oh, we can get you
anything you need.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.878
I'll be right back.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.045
Hello, may I help you?

17:24.108 --> 17:26.180
Vince Harris, F.A.A.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.429
I couldn't stay away, either.

19:17.055 --> 19:21.834
This was my father's favorite
place. His hideaway.

19:22.194 --> 19:26.472
Whenever he needed a place
to think, disappear.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.010
Is that why you came here?

19:30.836 --> 19:34.113
I thought that maybe since Keli'i
had shown himself to you...

19:36.541 --> 19:41.217
But he wasn't there.
Maybe I was trying too hard.

19:46.518 --> 19:51.024
I'm not sure trying has
anything to do with it.

19:55.227 --> 19:58.106
Yesterday, how did you know
where to find me?

19:59.798 --> 20:03.803
Your address was listed
in an old obituary.

20:05.737 --> 20:09.844
And a neighbor told me
you were at the school.

20:09.908 --> 20:13.321
After you left, I thought.

20:15.046 --> 20:19.188
"You have to leave this alone. You
have to stop thinking about Keli'i."

20:20.619 --> 20:23.122
But I went to Moku Charters,
instead.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.096
What do you expect
to find there?

20:28.293 --> 20:32.264
Something that would help me
put this feeling to rest,

20:32.330 --> 20:35.311
but instead I found
Granger Sea and Air and...

20:38.370 --> 20:39.713
I came here.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.182
You've been here all night?

20:41.239 --> 20:42.877
Well, I can't sleep, anyway.

20:45.710 --> 20:50.159
I keep dreaming about him.
It's always the same.

20:51.650 --> 20:56.065
He keeps gesturing me to follow him
down, and I keep following him.

20:57.122 --> 21:00.001
He keeps getting farther away.

21:01.526 --> 21:04.803
Magnum, do you think maybe
we're both crazy?

21:06.565 --> 21:07.566
No.

21:12.904 --> 21:17.216
You're the first person to say
Keli'i's name out loud in so, so long.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.686
I'd forgotten the sound of it.

21:22.581 --> 21:25.528
Stephen can't bear
to talk about him.

21:25.584 --> 21:28.861
It hurts even worse for him
because he feels so guilty.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.222
Why?

21:31.323 --> 21:35.829
Stephen thinks he should have been able
to protect his son against anything.

21:35.894 --> 21:36.895
Even against me.

21:38.597 --> 21:42.135
The day of the accident, Stephen
wanted Keli'i to stay home

21:42.200 --> 21:44.146
and help with
the household chores.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.575
Character building, he said.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.553
But it was such a beautiful day,

21:51.610 --> 21:55.524
and Keli'i wanted so much
to go with his grandfather.

21:58.583 --> 22:03.362
I'm afraid my own character is a
bit more lax than my husband's.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.398
I couldn't see
what harm could come.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.460
You couldn't have known.

22:10.428 --> 22:13.841
No. I suppose not. After...

22:15.567 --> 22:18.776
Afterwards, I did something
very foolish and...

22:20.672 --> 22:23.710
Stephen was afraid
to leave me alone.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.979
My weakness made
Stephen vulnerable.

22:28.046 --> 22:33.689
Granger Sea and Air wanted that location
and they paid $100,000 for Moku Charters.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.089
Was it worth that?

22:36.154 --> 22:38.657
To my father,
there was no price.

22:38.723 --> 22:40.862
But after he and Keli'i died...

22:48.300 --> 22:51.577
Harry Granger did very well
for himself, I think.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.751
And I have a feeling
he sleeps at night.

23:04.549 --> 23:09.191
Until you showed up yesterday, I'd
almost gotten used to not seeing Keli'i.

23:13.124 --> 23:15.365
I envy you your dream.

24:04.106 --> 24:06.347
<i>Even before I was
in training as a Navy Seal,</i>

24:06.408 --> 24:08.786
<i>I'd heard my share of stories
about rapture of the deep.</i>

24:08.844 --> 24:12.223
<i>And I was pretty sure that at
least some of them were true.</i>

24:12.281 --> 24:15.524
<i>But I was also sure that you couldn't
get rapture when you had both feet</i>

24:15.584 --> 24:18.394
<i>firmly planted on the ground.</i>

24:18.521 --> 24:22.560
<i>It wasn't lack of oxygen that caused me to
see that plane coming out of the sun at me.</i>

24:24.393 --> 24:26.669
<i>That plane
had physical dimension.</i>

24:26.762 --> 24:29.265
<i>And I knew that if I could
identify it and locate it,</i>

24:29.331 --> 24:32.335
<i>I had a good chance of getting
some questions answered.</i>

24:34.503 --> 24:36.608
Oh. My God!

24:42.144 --> 24:43.680
What have you done?

24:45.881 --> 24:49.590
Higgins! I thought you were out.

24:49.652 --> 24:52.189
You thought I was out!

24:52.254 --> 24:54.291
Oh. That got a little wrinkled
there. Here, let...

24:54.356 --> 24:56.927
Don't touch it. Haven't you
done enough damage already?

24:56.992 --> 24:59.666
I was just trying
to find some information.

24:59.728 --> 25:02.641
I might have expected some
feeble excuse like that from you

25:02.698 --> 25:04.769
after the flower
has been despoiled.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.210
Oh, please, Higgins.

25:06.268 --> 25:08.179
Don't you think you're
overreacting just a little bit?

25:08.237 --> 25:10.148
I mean, they're just books.

25:10.206 --> 25:12.914
Just books? Just books?

25:12.975 --> 25:16.616
Proust, Somerset Maugham, Balzac. You
can refer to them as "just books"?

25:16.679 --> 25:18.022
Oh, come on, Higgins.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.721
I'm afraid your blatant disregard
for the world's finest literature

25:20.783 --> 25:24.595
leaves me no choice but to make this room
off-limits to you from this moment forward.

25:24.653 --> 25:25.791
Oh, now wait a minute.

25:25.854 --> 25:28.334
If you used the Dewey Decimal
System like most reasonable...

25:28.390 --> 25:32.133
The Dewey Decimal System is antiquated.
Please leave. No!

25:32.194 --> 25:34.265
Not till I find
what I'm looking for.

25:37.233 --> 25:38.473
It's important.

25:38.968 --> 25:40.003
What is it?

25:40.069 --> 25:41.548
I can't tell you. Out.

25:41.604 --> 25:42.844
No, really, Higgins, I...

25:42.905 --> 25:44.578
If you're going to tell me
another wild-eyed story

25:44.640 --> 25:47.018
about children calling to you
from underwater...

25:47.076 --> 25:49.317
Of course not.
It's nothing like that.

25:49.378 --> 25:52.188
A World War ll plane just
tried to run me off the road.

25:53.983 --> 25:55.929
It came right at me,
out of the sun.

25:55.985 --> 25:57.862
The oldest fighter pilot trick
in the book.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.491
Now, Higgins, I'm not sure how
or why, but somehow, see,

26:00.556 --> 26:05.164
I think the airplane incident is
related to the boy underwater,

26:05.227 --> 26:07.229
and I... What are you doing?

26:07.363 --> 26:10.970
I'm calling the crisis clinic.
Believe me, it's for your own good.

26:11.033 --> 26:12.307
I saw it.

26:14.270 --> 26:19.276
And if I can find a picture of it, I
will show you exactly what plane it was.

26:27.916 --> 26:29.452
How do you do that?

26:29.585 --> 26:31.929
How do you know exactly
where every book is?

26:31.987 --> 26:33.864
How can you possibly keep track?

26:35.991 --> 26:39.734
It's a very simple system known only
to me and a charming, rather zaftig

26:39.795 --> 26:43.538
army clerk I met while
stationed in Burma.

26:43.599 --> 26:47.012
As a matter of fact, she and I
authored the system, as it were.

26:48.537 --> 26:53.145
I'll never forget that night. It
was a balmy evening, after hours.

26:53.208 --> 26:57.657
We were thrown together by chance
in the stacks of the base library.

26:57.713 --> 27:00.626
Naturally, conversation turned to
matters literary and before we knew it,

27:00.683 --> 27:05.132
we were swept away
by creative passion.

27:05.587 --> 27:09.125
One thing led to another and the
rest might have been library history

27:09.191 --> 27:11.228
had it not been for the fact...

27:17.199 --> 27:20.669
But that's another story.
Your plane?

27:21.503 --> 27:23.176
Oh. Right. Yeah.

27:24.106 --> 27:25.107
There.

27:28.410 --> 27:29.411
That's it.

27:30.045 --> 27:33.925
A Navy JRB. That is the plane that
tried to run me off the road.

27:33.982 --> 27:35.052
That's impossible.

27:35.117 --> 27:36.619
Oh, how can you know that?

27:43.592 --> 27:47.165
The annual report of the Anglo-Hawaiian
Aeronautical Enthusiast Society.

27:47.229 --> 27:50.767
You can see for yourself. There's not a
single World War ll vintage plane in Hawaii.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.711
Harry Granger! What?

27:54.470 --> 27:57.041
The President of the Enthusiast
Society is Harry Granger?

27:57.106 --> 28:00.087
Yes. Delightful chap. He was a pilot with
the American Volunteer Group in China.

28:00.142 --> 28:01.143
The Flying Tigers. The same.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.053
He now owns a charter
company here in Hawaii.

28:03.112 --> 28:06.719
Granger Sea and Air. Formerly Moku
Charters. I know. Thanks, Higgins.

28:29.905 --> 28:33.148
<i>Granger Sea and
Air, this is niner-five alpha.</i>

28:33.709 --> 28:36.053
<i>This is niner-five alpha.
Do you read me?</i>

28:36.111 --> 28:37.920
<i>Go ahead, nine-five alpha.</i>

28:37.980 --> 28:42.429
<i>I have an emergency GSA and I need
clearance to land and repair, over.</i>

28:43.452 --> 28:44.863
<i>That's a roger.</i>

28:44.953 --> 28:49.299
<i>T. C. .' Do you know what could happen to me
if anyone found out I was faking an emergency?</i>

28:49.358 --> 28:50.803
<i>My license, my business.</i>

28:50.859 --> 28:53.430
<i>It's the only way I could figure
to get close to the hangar.</i>

28:53.495 --> 28:55.532
<i>A little more
to your right, T. C.</i>

29:10.979 --> 29:13.050
Oh, great. Company.

29:20.856 --> 29:21.857
Hi.

29:22.157 --> 29:23.192
Are you the pilot?

29:23.258 --> 29:24.999
No. No. You got
a parts department open?

29:25.060 --> 29:26.801
I need some shock mountings
for an engine I'm working on.

29:26.862 --> 29:28.637
You mean LORD mounts? Uh, right.

29:28.697 --> 29:30.199
Ask Steve.
He's in the far hangar.

29:30.265 --> 29:31.266
Thanks.

29:35.838 --> 29:36.839
What seems to be the trouble?

29:36.905 --> 29:38.543
Oh, I don't know.

29:53.021 --> 29:56.195
You know much about helicopters?

29:56.258 --> 30:00.638
I'm afraid not. We don't get any choppers
out here. Mostly twin engine props.

30:00.696 --> 30:01.697
Yeah?

30:02.397 --> 30:05.708
To be honest with you, I've never
looked inside one of these before.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.178
No kidding.

30:08.437 --> 30:10.508
What do you think
the problem is?

30:10.572 --> 30:12.415
Oh, uh, hydraulics.

30:20.148 --> 30:22.287
We've got to, uh, disconnect
the relays,

30:22.351 --> 30:24.922
recalibrate the valves,

30:24.987 --> 30:27.593
check the points. You know,
all kind of heavy stuff.

30:27.689 --> 30:28.759
Oh, yeah.

30:32.895 --> 30:35.398
Uh, well, that should do it.

30:36.431 --> 30:39.378
And I want to thank you
for all of your help.

30:39.468 --> 30:40.947
Anytime!

31:36.391 --> 31:37.665
<i>Was it there?</i>

31:40.696 --> 31:43.643
<i>Thomas? Was the plane there?</i>

31:49.304 --> 31:51.875
<i>Have you ever stopped
to think this may be the work</i>

31:51.940 --> 31:55.046
<i>of an overtired, overactive,
imagination?</i>

31:55.110 --> 31:56.418
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:56.478 --> 31:58.185
<i>Then there was the time
I knew I'd seen Michelle,</i>

31:58.246 --> 32:01.693
<i>and you thought it was the work of an
overtired, overactive, imagination.</i>

32:01.750 --> 32:04.060
<i>Then there was the time I was sure
I'd seen Mac, and you thought...</i>

32:04.119 --> 32:06.258
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

32:07.589 --> 32:10.570
<i>But this time you keep
running into a dead end.</i>

32:11.360 --> 32:13.033
<i>Maybe this time is different.</i>

32:13.929 --> 32:14.930
<i>Maybe.</i>

32:20.135 --> 32:22.775
<i>Okay, where to now?</i>

32:33.615 --> 32:37.324
<i>My cousin Mike took me diving for
the first time when I was in high school,</i>

32:37.386 --> 32:39.764
<i>and a whole new world
opened up to me.</i>

32:39.821 --> 32:43.428
<i>A world with its own set of
rules, perspective, and reality.</i>

32:43.659 --> 32:46.538
<i>It was a lesson I never forgot.</i>

32:46.762 --> 32:51.677
<i>Now, I knew that Keli'i hadn't come to me
in your everyday, ordinary kind of reality.</i>

32:51.733 --> 32:54.213
<i>But that didn't mean
I hadn't seen him.</i>

32:54.302 --> 32:57.442
<i>What it did mean was that I
couldn't stop asking questions</i>

32:57.506 --> 32:59.918
<i>until I found
out why I'd seen him.</i>

33:25.167 --> 33:27.670
I should've known you'd show up.

33:27.736 --> 33:30.307
Here to see your handiwork?

33:30.472 --> 33:31.849
I stopped at the school.

33:31.907 --> 33:33.477
Yeah, yeah. They called me.

33:33.542 --> 33:36.853
Told me that llima
had shown up drunk.

33:37.079 --> 33:40.549
They tried to get her to go home. Only,
of course, she had a different idea.

33:42.184 --> 33:43.891
Look, Mr. Parker...
No, you look.

33:45.353 --> 33:48.857
You take a good look at
exactly what you're doing.

33:50.525 --> 33:52.971
Are you proud of yourself,
Mr. Magnum?

33:53.061 --> 33:56.167
You know, before you came into our lives,
llima and I, we were holding it together.

33:56.231 --> 34:00.338
We had gotten past the years of
drinking, the nervous breakdown,

34:01.369 --> 34:03.713
the attempted suicide.

34:04.272 --> 34:06.115
Or didn't she
tell you about that?

34:09.277 --> 34:14.158
She told me she'd rather be dead
with Keli'i than go on living alone.

34:14.216 --> 34:16.092
As if she were alone.

34:19.955 --> 34:22.458
I found her in time that day.

34:23.824 --> 34:26.203
I don't know if I will
the next time.

34:27.596 --> 34:28.597
Will you?

34:31.699 --> 34:33.976
Aren't you going
to take her home?

34:35.971 --> 34:36.972
She won't go.

34:58.860 --> 34:59.861
Ilima?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.136
That's funny.

35:08.403 --> 35:10.974
Everywhere I go, I run into you.

35:32.060 --> 35:33.801
Stephen was here.

35:37.365 --> 35:38.810
He's mad.

35:44.639 --> 35:47.848
I've been trying to figure out
all afternoon

35:47.909 --> 35:51.982
how it is that some people lose
everyone who's close to them.

35:54.783 --> 35:56.490
What causes that?

36:06.494 --> 36:08.906
I don't think there
is a reason, llima.

36:10.232 --> 36:13.941
No, there must be something.

36:17.639 --> 36:21.280
I almost lost Stephen.
During the war.

36:23.378 --> 36:26.757
I couldn't sleep for three
weeks waiting to hear.

36:29.417 --> 36:32.364
When the phone rang, I knew.

36:34.723 --> 36:38.694
I knew he was okay
before I ever answered.

36:40.629 --> 36:42.336
I keep thinking

36:43.531 --> 36:45.238
that phone

36:46.468 --> 36:48.243
is going to ring again.

36:54.676 --> 36:55.882
Ilima,

36:58.313 --> 37:00.156
I am going to stop.

37:03.485 --> 37:07.456
I can't believe Keli'i would
want me to keep searching

37:07.522 --> 37:09.160
if he knew it was
hurting you like this.

37:09.891 --> 37:11.700
You can't stop.

37:14.596 --> 37:15.597
I stopped,

37:17.565 --> 37:19.272
and Keli'i went away.

37:24.005 --> 37:27.680
He found you. Please.

37:30.612 --> 37:32.057
Don't let him down.

37:53.601 --> 37:58.016
<i>I kept telling myself
this was the last dive.</i>

37:58.073 --> 38:00.576
<i>The last chance to find Keli'i.</i>

38:00.675 --> 38:04.145
<i>I told myself that after
this dive, I'd quit looking.</i>

38:04.212 --> 38:05.987
<i>That's what I told myself.</i>

38:07.615 --> 38:11.392
<i>But even though Keli'i stayed
elusive, I couldn't surface.</i>

38:11.453 --> 38:13.490
<i>Even though I knew that,
as tired as I was,</i>

38:13.555 --> 38:17.435
<i>I was putting myself in real
danger, I couldn't quit looking.</i>

38:17.525 --> 38:19.698
<i>And even though I knew that
beyond 200 feet,</i>

38:19.761 --> 38:22.332
<i>my own chances of survival were
getting slimmer and slimmer,</i>

38:22.397 --> 38:25.139
<i>I couldn't force myself
to go up.</i>

38:25.200 --> 38:28.272
<i>Something or someone
kept drawing me down.</i>

38:28.603 --> 38:31.345
<i>And as I kept going deeper
and deeper, I told myself.</i>

38:31.406 --> 38:35.013
<i>I had to take the chance
to find Keli'i.</i>

38:49.024 --> 38:51.061
<i>And at last, I saw it.</i>

38:51.693 --> 38:52.694
<i>Not the boy.</i>

38:53.261 --> 38:55.798
<i>But something maybe
even more important.</i>

38:55.897 --> 39:00.209
<i>I knew I'd found what Keli'i
had been trying to show me.</i>

39:24.626 --> 39:27.072
I found it, Keli'i, I found it!

39:33.999 --> 39:37.037
I still don't understand
the reason for such jubilation.

39:37.136 --> 39:42.142
Don't you see, Higgins? The plane I
found in Kahuku Lagoon was a Corsair.

39:42.207 --> 39:43.618
A World War ll vintage plane.

39:43.676 --> 39:45.451
I'm aware of that.
Nevertheless...

39:45.511 --> 39:48.651
So was the Navy JRB that tried
to run me off the road.

39:48.714 --> 39:52.093
I know, but what possible connection
could there be between a plane which has

39:52.151 --> 39:55.394
been submerged at the bottom
of the ocean for 40 years

39:55.454 --> 39:57.832
and the Navy JRB which
tried to run you off the road?

39:57.890 --> 39:59.767
Maybe Stephen Parker.

40:01.093 --> 40:05.735
I have studied Aristotle, Socrates, Wilhelm
Freidrich Hegel, Bertrand Russell.

40:05.798 --> 40:08.506
I have toured college campuses
debating the virtues of dialectic

40:08.567 --> 40:10.911
versus symbolic syllogism.

40:10.970 --> 40:15.817
I have written scholarly articles on the
need for a new, more dynamic logic.

40:15.908 --> 40:20.721
But nothing in my life has prepared me for
the workings of the Thomas Magnum mind.

40:22.815 --> 40:23.816
I was right.

40:24.783 --> 40:27.764
Lt. Stephen Parker,
Marine Corps pilot.

40:27.820 --> 40:30.391
He flew A-6 Intruders
in Vietnam.

40:30.456 --> 40:32.458
There were thousands of
Marine pilots in Vietnam.

40:32.524 --> 40:35.437
What makes you think that Parker
was the man in the Navy JRB?

40:35.494 --> 40:37.440
Don't you see, Higgins?
It's symbolic.

40:37.496 --> 40:39.533
His son is killed
in a boating accident.

40:39.598 --> 40:41.305
Except maybe it's not
an accident.

40:41.367 --> 40:44.678
Maybe someone who's still around
has something to do with it.

40:44.737 --> 40:47.946
And that someone is the only
person in the entire Islands

40:48.007 --> 40:50.510
who owns a vintage
World War ll airplane.

40:50.576 --> 40:53.352
So Keli'i points me
in the direction

40:53.412 --> 40:55.517
of the only clue that he can,
a World War ll plane,

40:55.581 --> 40:57.219
hoping that I could

40:57.282 --> 40:59.990
take the leap,
find the connection.

41:04.023 --> 41:07.835
So you're saying that Keli'i
Parker led you to this Corsair

41:07.893 --> 41:11.067
so you could find whoever
is responsible for his murder?

41:11.130 --> 41:14.771
I think, Higgins, if you will look
at this thing a little off-center,

41:14.833 --> 41:16.437
a little sideways,

41:16.502 --> 41:21.076
you will see that whoever owned the
plane that tried to run me off the road

41:21.140 --> 41:23.814
probably killed
Keli'i and his grandfather.

41:23.876 --> 41:27.187
Now, it is up to me to find out
if Stephen Parker is that man.

41:27.246 --> 41:29.726
And I think I know
someone who can help me out.

41:36.655 --> 41:38.066
Astonishing.

41:39.558 --> 41:41.765
It just isn't possible!

41:41.860 --> 41:43.806
No, no. It was an accident.

41:43.862 --> 41:47.309
An accident that paved the way
for you to buy Moku Charters.

41:47.733 --> 41:49.644
Look, I really wanted
this location.

41:49.702 --> 41:52.581
I knew that it would double,
even triple, my business.

41:52.638 --> 41:55.983
Now, I offered Parker's father-in-law
twice the fair market value.

41:56.041 --> 41:57.384
He wouldn't sell.

41:57.443 --> 42:00.049
He was a stubborn old man,
and I was furious.

42:00.112 --> 42:02.649
But I would never, never
condone murder. Never.

42:02.715 --> 42:03.819
I'm not saying you did,

42:03.882 --> 42:08.092
but maybe Stephen Parker thought
for $100,000 it was worth it.

42:08.687 --> 42:12.328
100,000?
I wish I got off so easy.

42:12.458 --> 42:15.405
I paid $500,000 to Parker.

42:15.894 --> 42:18.773
No. No, I just can't believe it.

42:19.932 --> 42:20.967
All right,

42:21.033 --> 42:24.139
look, maybe you're right. Maybe Parker
didn't plant explosives on that boat.

42:24.203 --> 42:26.513
But just...
What if you're wrong?

42:26.672 --> 42:29.448
Don't you think it's time
somebody found out for sure?

42:30.476 --> 42:32.615
Well, if he does
have that plane,

42:33.378 --> 42:38.350
there's a small airfield, couple
of hangars, out past Mokuleia.

42:38.417 --> 42:39.418
Thank you.

43:12.518 --> 43:15.965
I don't want to go, Stephen!
Just leave me alone.

43:16.021 --> 43:19.195
- I don't care what you want anymore.
- Parker.

43:19.258 --> 43:20.862
What are you doing here?

43:20.926 --> 43:22.803
I came to talk to Stephen.

43:22.861 --> 43:26.968
Do you know something, Stephen?
Everywhere I go, I see him.

43:27.032 --> 43:29.512
Get in the plane.
Why is that, do you suppose?

43:29.568 --> 43:30.808
Get in the plane. We're leaving.

43:30.836 --> 43:32.197
There's nowhere left to go,
Parker.

43:32.204 --> 43:35.048
I told you to leave us alone.
You just wouldn't go away.

43:35.107 --> 43:36.518
You're hurting me, Stephen.

43:36.575 --> 43:38.179
Why don't you just let her go?

43:38.310 --> 43:40.085
Why didn't you stop?

43:40.145 --> 43:41.783
You had to keep
asking questions.

43:41.847 --> 43:45.385
Somebody would've found out, someday. If it
wasn't me, it would've been somebody else.

43:45.450 --> 43:47.430
What are you talking about?
Shut up.

43:47.486 --> 43:50.763
What were you going to do? Kill
everybody that started to suspect?

43:51.223 --> 43:52.702
Oh, you got all the answers.

43:52.758 --> 43:56.035
You just let her go and then
we'll talk about it.

43:56.094 --> 43:57.402
Talk about what?

43:57.462 --> 44:00.739
The whole thing was her fault anyway.
Stephen?

44:00.799 --> 44:03.075
I told her not to let Keli'i
out on that boat.

44:03.135 --> 44:05.206
He had to stay home and take
care of chores. I told her that.

44:05.270 --> 44:06.806
No, Stephen, no.

44:06.872 --> 44:09.409
Ilima, I want you
to come over to me.

44:09.474 --> 44:12.250
She's not going anywhere.
Somebody is gonna have to pay.

44:12.311 --> 44:13.483
Not llima.

44:14.947 --> 44:16.153
All right.

44:16.849 --> 44:20.592
I put the explosives on the boat,
but what else was I gonna do?

44:20.652 --> 44:24.395
I had tried talking with her father.
He wouldn't sell.

44:24.456 --> 44:26.436
He wouldn't listen to reason.
I only wanted a future.

44:26.491 --> 44:28.835
I only wanted to take care
of my wife and son.

44:28.927 --> 44:30.668
Stephen, tell me you didn't
kill our baby!

44:30.729 --> 44:32.231
I didn't! You did!

44:32.297 --> 44:34.277
No. You let Keli'i
out on the boat.

44:34.333 --> 44:36.677
No, no!

44:41.740 --> 44:42.741
Stay right there.

44:48.547 --> 44:50.026
Where you gonna go, Parker?

44:50.582 --> 44:52.994
No matter where you land,
you'll take this with you.

45:41.133 --> 45:42.840
<i>Illusion and reality.</i>

45:42.901 --> 45:45.541
<i>Anyone not watching Stephen
Parker carefully</i>

45:45.604 --> 45:47.982
<i>might have thought he was
running away from his destiny.</i>

45:48.073 --> 45:51.418
<i>In reality, he ran
headlong into it.</i>

45:51.476 --> 45:54.514
<i>Stephen Parker's plane
was lost at sea.</i>

45:54.613 --> 45:57.025
<i>He'd tried to live too long
with an act he'd committed</i>

45:57.082 --> 45:59.995
<i>that had robbed him
of his humanity.</i>

46:00.052 --> 46:01.554
<i>He wasn't trying to run away.</i>

46:01.620 --> 46:05.625
<i>There was nothing for him to do but join the
two people he'd sent to a watery grave.</i>

46:12.998 --> 46:14.477
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

46:14.533 --> 46:16.535
<i>I said I wasn't going
to dive anymore,</i>

46:16.601 --> 46:19.707
<i>at least not to find Keli'i.</i>

46:19.771 --> 46:22.251
<i>But I wasn't looking
for the boy.</i>

46:22.741 --> 46:25.847
<i>In fact, I knew he wasn't
going to make an appearance.</i>

46:25.911 --> 46:29.290
<i>I had the feeling he didn't
need anything from me anymore.</i>

47:00.479 --> 47:03.892
<i>As for Ilima, knowing the
truth about her son's death,</i>

47:03.949 --> 47:07.362
<i>had helped her stop blaming herself
and start living her own life again.</i>

47:12.991 --> 47:15.335
<i>A little emptiness would
always be there,</i>

47:16.461 --> 47:18.566
<i>but at least her nightmares
were over.</i>
