02:36.200 --> 02:38.191
Hello, Jefferson, are you busy?

02:38.440 --> 02:40.590
You're having sex with Marcie.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.230
What, is she holding a gun?

02:45.320 --> 02:47.072
Okay, I'll wait.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.630
Let's go, let's go.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.031
Now, look, it's my day off and the
Brute channel is gonna show Hondo.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.032
John Wayne's greatest movie
of all time.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.068
Now, I know Peg wants me to fix
the basement steps, so I need a favour.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.710
Come over and hide in the bushes,
then I'm gonna open the door...

03:04.920 --> 03:07.673
...and say, " My, the clouds
are looking fluffy today."

03:07.880 --> 03:10.838
That's your excuse to come in
having an appendicitis attack...

03:11.040 --> 03:12.917
...and need me to rush you
to the hospital.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.509
Then we'll go to your house
and watch Hondo.

03:17.800 --> 03:21.315
What do you mean, "Faster, faster"?
I'm talking as fast as I can. Hello?

03:27.080 --> 03:28.991
Sex in the morning.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.036
Sex with Marcie.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.960
Sex in the morning with Marcie.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.118
Hi, honey.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.238
It's time to get some chores done.

03:47.480 --> 03:52.156
Now, to be fair, we'll both pick
from the job jar. I'll pick the red one.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.391
Well, that's where I went wrong.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.554
"Continue sitting on couch."

03:58.800 --> 04:02.839
Oh, lucky. All right, Al. Your turn.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.071
Gee, I wonder what it will be.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.638
All right.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.590
"Fix basement step."

04:14.840 --> 04:17.195
Tough break, honey.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.600
Well, a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

04:20.839 --> 04:24.196
Excuse me, Peg, I'm just gonna
get a little fresh air first.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.029
My, the clouds
are looking fluffy today.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.912
My, the clouds
are looking fluffy today.

04:48.400 --> 04:52.757
I said, my, the clouds
are looking fluffy today...

04:52.960 --> 04:55.394
...you earless moron.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.670
Al. Al.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.189
It's an emergency. I need you to...

05:10.680 --> 05:13.319
- What?
- Rush you to the hospital?

05:13.560 --> 05:17.314
Yes, yes. I'm in great pain.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.039
What's wrong, Jefferson?

05:19.760 --> 05:22.991
It's an appendicitis, Peg. See?

05:24.880 --> 05:27.713
Thank God it's not a groin pull.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.156
Yeah, I'm a paramedic.
I heard the yelling.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.995
Good thing I was parked on the street,
avoiding my supervisor.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.714
Come on, we'll have that appendix
out in no time.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.797
No, no, no, you see.
You don't understand.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.275
I was helping Al. Tell him I was...

05:47.960 --> 05:50.474
Well, honey, now you can fix
the basement step.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.280
Peg, Hondo's coming on at 3:30.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.918
Hondo, Peg.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.869
John Wayne's best movie.
It only comes on once every 17 years.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.918
Oh, Peg, please let me watch Hondo.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.072
Oh, now, Al. It's only 9:30.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.630
You can fix the step
and watch your stupid Hondo.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.075
All right, I'll fix the step.
Where are my tools?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.914
Well, in the tool chest.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.998
You know, there is something else
that needs fixing down there.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.269
- Light bulb out?
- Yeah, that's it.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.156
Would you get me
the flashlight, Peg?

06:36.400 --> 06:40.234
Now, how am I supposed
to do my job and yours?

06:40.480 --> 06:44.075
I tell you.
Now I know how Hillary feels.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.120
All right, Al, I've got it. Now what?

06:50.360 --> 06:52.476
Well, you can shove it up...

06:54.440 --> 06:56.158
- Never mind.
- Come on, hurry, Al...

06:56.360 --> 06:59.670
...this flashlight weighs a ton.
- It's not the flashlight.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.949
Wait a minute, Peg, it doesn't work.

07:04.200 --> 07:08.079
Peg, do me a favour. Go to the store
and get me some D batteries.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.919
Well, what are you gonna do?

07:10.160 --> 07:12.435
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
be having a good time.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.073
I'll do what I can in the dark.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.039
Oh, like during sex?

07:17.840 --> 07:19.956
No, Peg, I can't fake fixing a step.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.439
Hey, Kel, we got any D batteries?

07:41.680 --> 07:44.877
Yeah, I think there's some
in the tool chest.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.710
- Find it?
- Yeah.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.358
Kel, check this out.
It's Buck's birth certificate.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.512
Wow, according to this,
he was born 10 years ago.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.275
God, that would make him
10 years old.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.878
And they wanted to neuter me.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.232
Hey, I've got an idea.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.835
Please don't say
"Let's do something nice for him."

08:17.080 --> 08:19.674
Let's do something nice for him.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.638
What can we do though?

08:21.840 --> 08:24.308
Food would be nice.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.471
Let's take him out for some exercise.

08:26.720 --> 08:30.156
Oh, good,
the very thing you need food for.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.754
- Hey, we can take him to that park.
- Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.514
You mean
where the Rottweilers hunt?

08:36.919 --> 08:39.558
Come on, boy,
we're gonna have the time of your life.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.392
But I hate Rottweilers.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.952
Hey, can't I play with the drug-sniffing
dogs? You know, they're so laid back.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.151
Okay, Al, I got your batteries.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.795
Peg, these are A's. I needed D's.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.634
A's, D's, what's the difference?

08:58.080 --> 08:59.354
They're too small.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.875
Then use a lot of them.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.636
Better yet, I'll exchange them...

09:04.880 --> 09:06.438
...for bullets.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.589
- I'm going with you.
- lf you go, you'll wanna shop.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.552
I'm just gonna get the new batteries.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.110
I was just at that store. There is
absolutely nothing I want there.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.517
- Now let's go.
- But, Peg, Hondo's coming on.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.754
Peg, do we really need
Christmas icicles? It's May.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.877
Well, you'll thank me in December.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.634
Only if you leave me in November.

09:45.080 --> 09:50.518
Oh, look, Al.
They're doing a Full House in 3-D.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.880
Is the third dimension
the funny one?

09:55.240 --> 09:56.958
Gee, I don't know.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.794
But these glasses are annoying.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.676
Well, at least you look stupid.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.997
I'm bored. I'm gonna go get some
ice cream and wait in the car.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.196
Don't put back those icicles.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.192
I won't.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.512
Excuse me.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.834
My 26 cats are waiting
for these three cans of Liver Feast.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.877
Do you mind if I cut in?

10:30.680 --> 10:33.513
Well, age before beauty.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.639
Thank you, beauty.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.515
You're welcome, age.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.438
Hey, lady. You know,
Hondo's coming on pretty soon.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.750
You know, it's a story
about the Wild West.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.878
You remember the Wild West,
don't you?

10:54.400 --> 10:58.916
Aren't you that mean shoe salesman
at the mall?

10:59.160 --> 11:02.118
No. You must have me mistaken
for someone else.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.875
Check stand two is now open.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.750
Yes, I am that shoe salesman.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.596
And I don't need your stinking place
in line. Eat shoe and die.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.795
Gotta see Hondo. Gotta see Hondo.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.429
Sir, would you let me
in front of you, please?

11:29.400 --> 11:32.119
Don't call me "sir," you cliff dweller.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.828
- Bad enough you ruined my morning.
- Yeah?

11:35.080 --> 11:39.073
You think hearing you scream " Ride me
like a show horse" did me any good?

11:40.760 --> 11:44.878
Let me go in front of you and
I'll be out of what's left of your hair.

11:45.840 --> 11:50.356
Just relax. This is what it's like
to be a part of civilization.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.279
Wait, I have a coupon.

11:52.520 --> 11:56.513
Un-freaking-believable!
There's always one.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.517
- No, don't worry. I'm paying cash.
- Thank God.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.115
Yeah, my wife and I put a penny in
every time we make love.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.556
We're like rabbits.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.798
Good. On Easter,
I'll dip you both in chocolate...

12:11.000 --> 12:12.911
...and break your heads off.

12:19.240 --> 12:23.552
We don't see that much Confederate
money around here anymore.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.471
What happened
to just paying and leaving?

12:28.720 --> 12:30.631
People just have too many options.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.472
Next.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.117
This vaporizer is 39.99 here...

12:36.360 --> 12:41.434
...but I found it somewhere else for
39.98 and you say you'll beat any ad.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.516
That'll be $753.84.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.759
Every time my husband and I
make love.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.957
My wife bought the wrong batteries.
Since I can't exchange her...

13:04.160 --> 13:06.196
...l'd like to exchange these for these.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.517
In my day, you just push them buttons
a bit, the register went:

13:11.720 --> 13:13.199
And the drawer popped out.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.916
That's a fascinating story, sir.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.799
These days we have computers.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.753
They make things a lot easier
and quicker.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.593
Computer's down.
Sorry, sir, you'll have to wait.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.757
I can't wait
for the computer to come on.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.951
I gotta get home for Hondo.
Just add it up.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.237
- I can't do that.
- You can't add?

13:40.480 --> 13:42.436
Good career choice.

13:43.240 --> 13:47.677
I don't have to take this.
If I knew how, I would call Security.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.995
Well, don't learn a new skill
on my account.

13:53.240 --> 13:56.596
Just keep the stinking batteries.
I'm taking my business elsewhere.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.748
Open these doors.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.912
Can't.
The computer controls them too.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.552
And you just lost your place in line.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.475
That was fun.
It's good to get out, watch Buck run.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.796
Yeah. He must have had a great time.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.476
Call 911.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.709
K-911.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.314
Well, now what do you want
to do with him?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.192
Hey, I know. Let's play...

14:31.440 --> 14:33.237
Anything but Frisbee.

14:33.720 --> 14:34.948
...Frisbee.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.159
No, not the disk of death.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.914
Oh, look at his eyes light up.

14:42.680 --> 14:46.468
I'd tear out both your hearts if my teeth
weren't in a glass in my doghouse.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.193
Come on, boy.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.390
You know, in these stressful times...

14:53.600 --> 14:57.036
...it's nice to have a quiet moment
to get to know each other.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.277
I want out!
It's 90 minutes to Hondo.

15:04.040 --> 15:08.511
Al, are you gonna be long?
Hondo's on in 90 minutes.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.955
I know, Peg. The doors won't open.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.192
I know the stores are open.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.159
That's where I got this lovely dress.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.470
No more. No more.

15:19.720 --> 15:23.952
What's that? Buy more? Buy more?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.796
Don't buy anything.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.270
Buy a dinner ring?

15:29.520 --> 15:31.431
I haven't thought
about jewellery before...

15:31.640 --> 15:33.756
...but I guess l...
- No. Don't buy.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.831
Bye.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.908
My wife is out there,
unsupervised, with credit cards.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.719
Where's your computer expert?

15:44.240 --> 15:46.549
Out there. He can't get in.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.475
Okay, Buck. Here it comes, boy.
Catch it.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.472
Why didn't you jump?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.110
I did.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.759
You know, Kel. I think the problem
is Buck's getting too old to jump.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.956
Yeah. I know.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.668
- You throw it to him and I'll lift him.
- All right.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.911
This will be good.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.633
Okay, Buck. Here it comes, boy.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.433
Kelly?

16:26.800 --> 16:29.394
Kelly? Speak to me.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.390
Come closer.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.517
What? What is it?

16:37.160 --> 16:41.676
Oh, come on. She's never gonna
get that Frisbee to fit there.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.233
Well, I'll be damned.

16:55.160 --> 16:59.039
Someone hasn't been eating
their fibre.

17:05.160 --> 17:08.516
Hey, come on, fella.
Put the bat down.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.108
Come sit around the hibachi.
Swap some stories, huh?

17:12.520 --> 17:14.431
You want a story?

17:15.119 --> 17:17.429
I got a story for you.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.031
About a little place
I like to call America.

17:21.319 --> 17:27.634
Before scanners and bar codes
and computers and wives.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.798
Can I help you,
pretty-but-fallen lady?

17:47.320 --> 17:50.437
I hope so. They want me to do
the cancan down at the saloon...

17:50.640 --> 17:53.916
...so I guess I'm gonna need
some cans.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.798
You got yourself
some fancy book learning, ain't you?

18:00.480 --> 18:04.393
Howdy, my honest
young merchant friend.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.029
I need a few things.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.999
I need a deck of marked cards,
some loaded dice...

18:10.200 --> 18:13.795
...and some genuine
cowhide condoms.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.759
Although in these simpler times,
we don't need them...

18:16.960 --> 18:20.077
...but heck, they feel so good
we don't need the woman either.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.992
Hey, not in front of the boy,
Mr. D'Arcy.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.834
You'll put ideas in his head.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.360
Next thing you know,
he'll be out behind the barn...

18:30.560 --> 18:32.357
...with his wooden woman.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.634
Hey, order me up
a couple of jugs too.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.958
Ma, now, you know
you scare the customers...

18:45.240 --> 18:47.117
...when you stare
into that box like that.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.148
Yeah, I know. But I just get
this feeling that one day...

18:51.360 --> 18:55.035
...there's gonna be people
small enough to fit in there.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.276
Afternoon, barefoot bumpkins.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.672
Afternoon, Miss Evil Bank President.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.915
It has come to my attention
that these simple times...

19:12.120 --> 19:15.271
...are going far too easy
for you folks.

19:15.520 --> 19:20.230
Let's see if that changes
when you have to use this.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.879
What in tarnation is that?

19:24.800 --> 19:27.030
It's a computer!

19:27.680 --> 19:31.912
And we're gonna make you use them
whether you like it or not.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.758
Now hold on a second, pilgrim.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.709
What is that gizmo?

19:48.960 --> 19:52.316
That's not a gizmo, it's a computer.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.869
Now it's a gizmo.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.632
Now, you take your prairie-chicken
hide and cluck on out of here.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.908
Well, I'll be back,
and next time, I'm bringing Muzak.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.832
Thanks, Bundo.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.038
Oh, Bundo, you are just
the kind of man we need...

20:33.240 --> 20:35.470
...in these sweet and innocent times.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.597
Now, if there's anything
I can do for you...

20:38.040 --> 20:40.474
Well, there is one thing.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.476
Take a powder, boy.

20:46.560 --> 20:52.795
Not that. No, I'm looking for a copy of
that new girlie magazine, Bare Ankle.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.478
I hear they're corning out
with a new 3-D issue.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.350
So I say...

21:06.600 --> 21:09.433
...we should do
what John Wayne would have done.

21:09.800 --> 21:13.998
Let's show these machines
who's running things.

21:14.240 --> 21:18.392
I say we kick some computer butt.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.679
For Hondo!

21:37.880 --> 21:40.474
Oh, my head.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.999
What time is it? Hondo!

21:48.880 --> 21:52.350
And that's the conclusion
of the classic western Hondo.

21:52.600 --> 21:57.628
Join us February 18, 2011
for the encore showing of...

22:03.480 --> 22:05.311
Well, I might have missed Hondo...

22:05.560 --> 22:08.028
...but at least I stood up
for what I believed in.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.032
Honey,
you better sit back down again...

22:10.240 --> 22:14.836
...because that computer you destroyed
is gonna cost $4000.

22:15.200 --> 22:19.876
Well, thank God
I make that much in a year.

22:21.320 --> 22:24.392
Mom, Dad, you guys seen Buck?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.716
We were gonna
take him Rollerblading.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.909
He's in the basement. Let's get him.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.473
You...

22:37.040 --> 22:41.511
I may be old, but I can still
throw my v oice with the best of them.

22:42.305 --> 22:48.838
