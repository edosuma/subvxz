00:15.415 --> 00:19.397
<i>A special smile</i>

00:19.432 --> 00:23.379
<i>A certain touch</i>

00:24.257 --> 00:28.226
<i>I never had a love</i>

00:28.261 --> 00:31.698
<i>That I loved so much</i>

00:31.733 --> 00:35.430
<i>When I look back</i>

00:35.465 --> 00:39.128
<i>You're everywhere</i>

00:39.272 --> 00:43.204
<i>Turn the page</i>

00:43.239 --> 00:47.136
<i>You were there</i>

00:47.580 --> 00:51.495
<i>My one sure thing</i>

00:51.530 --> 00:55.411
<i>My solid ground</i>

00:56.856 --> 01:00.492
<i>All I ever wanted</i>

01:00.527 --> 01:04.030
<i>Was the love we found</i>

01:04.065 --> 01:07.801
<i>You came and answered</i>

01:07.836 --> 01:11.555
<i>My every prayer</i>

01:11.590 --> 01:15.429
<i>Turn the page</i>

01:15.464 --> 01:19.268
<i>You were there</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:22.915
<i>Turn the page</i>

01:22.950 --> 01:26.681
<i>You were</i>

01:26.716 --> 01:30.412
<i>There</i>

01:56.116 --> 02:00.109
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, watch it, you idiots!

02:00.286 --> 02:03.223
<i>Be careful with those!
They're violins, not bowling balls!</i>

02:03.258 --> 02:05.423
Why so many?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.394
- Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing...
- Mom?

02:08.429 --> 02:10.360
<i>- What?
- Which box has our toys?</i>

02:10.395 --> 02:13.333
What the hell is Lexi doing?
I can't hear the phone!

02:13.368 --> 02:16.469
Yes, I'm still holding.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.838
Okay, well, um...

02:19.873 --> 02:22.275
Listen, you don't have
to lie to me...

02:22.310 --> 02:25.243
because I know
that he's there.

02:25.278 --> 02:29.271
Well, just check under Lana Holden,
Mrs. Lana Holden.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.519
Well... okay, okay, fine.

02:34.554 --> 02:38.547
Just tell Lieutenant Demetras that his
wife called again, will you? Please?

02:38.958 --> 02:42.527
- And tell him that... Ma! Jeez!
- No!

02:42.562 --> 02:45.430
I want you to listen to me now.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.535
You can't keep doing this to yourself
or to the boys.

02:48.570 --> 02:51.536
They need their mother now.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.538
You're a beautiful, talented woman.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.842
- You have your whole life ahead of you.
- Ma, if I'm so beautiful...

02:55.877 --> 02:59.579
and talented, tell me
why did Charles leave me?

02:59.614 --> 03:03.249
Because Charles
is a big jerk.

03:03.284 --> 03:07.242
Now get dressed.

03:45.692 --> 03:49.429
What am I gonna do?

03:49.464 --> 03:53.422
Well...

03:53.700 --> 03:56.836
first you eat breakfast.

03:56.871 --> 04:00.418
A little black coffee.

04:00.453 --> 04:03.966
And then you get a job.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.445
Any job.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.548
<i>The boys,
God bless them...</i>

04:10.583 --> 04:14.576
They're big eaters.
I can't afford it.

04:15.955 --> 04:19.291
Well, he's gonna get
sick of her, Ma.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.024
We'll see.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.795
Well...

04:23.830 --> 04:26.399
in the meantime...

04:26.434 --> 04:30.392
get a job.

04:40.413 --> 04:44.406
Just wrap,
you're not Picasso.

04:45.551 --> 04:49.544
Picasso would have
put the bows on the back of the box.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.660
Brian Turner.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.761
Roberta Guaspari.

04:56.796 --> 05:00.789
Oh, my gosh. I thought you moved away.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.803
I did. I'm just here
for my mom's birthday.

05:03.838 --> 05:07.071
Oh, that's nice.
That's really...

05:07.106 --> 05:11.099
- Uh, that's for my mom.
- Oh, man... Yeah, Turner.

05:11.678 --> 05:15.671
Very pretty though.
Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

05:15.948 --> 05:19.819
- Yes, I knew... I heard you
wrote a book, right? - Mm-hmm.

05:19.854 --> 05:22.353
- I didn't read it, though.
- That's okay.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.892
Neither did my mom. Looks good
on her coffee table, though.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.433
Thank you very much,
and please come again.

05:33.468 --> 05:35.533
<i>So what are you doing here?</i>

05:35.568 --> 05:38.838
I thought you'd be
in Carnegie Hall by now.

05:38.873 --> 05:41.606
It's a long story.

05:41.641 --> 05:45.634
<i>So my college professor said
it was too late.</i>

05:45.712 --> 05:48.915
You know? I hadn't had enough training
to be a concert violinist.

05:48.950 --> 05:52.336
So I took a degree
in teaching.

05:52.371 --> 05:55.648
I bet you're
a great teacher.

05:55.683 --> 05:58.890
Well, I think I am.
Or I could...

05:58.925 --> 06:01.527
But every time I would
get started on something,

06:01.562 --> 06:03.494
Charles would be transferred.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.932
And then I had my kids,
and I took time out to raise them.

06:05.967 --> 06:10.368
Then by the time I wanted
to start teaching again,

06:10.403 --> 06:14.396
You know, Navy wife.
You can't count on her to stick around.

06:14.540 --> 06:18.533
So I-I-I decided what I would do
is start my own program.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.780
And Charles gave me
the money... to do that.

06:22.815 --> 06:26.808
- We were in Greece. I bought 50 violins at this little Greek shop.
- "Fifty"?

06:27.687 --> 06:31.680
And I started the program
at this little private school and, uh...

06:34.560 --> 06:38.308
- And then...
- And then your husband ran off with your best friend.

06:38.343 --> 06:42.057
<i>That's right. No, she was not
my best friend. She was a friend.</i>

06:42.702 --> 06:46.695
So what are you gonna do? Just wrap
presents and wait till he comes back?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.075
You sound like my mother.

06:51.110 --> 06:55.103
Oh, God. Heaven forbid.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.749
I've met your mother.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.551
You don't look like her, though.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.055
You know something?
I've been thinking.

07:04.090 --> 07:08.094
I know this cool lady.
I wrote a piece about her.

07:08.129 --> 07:11.896
She runs
this elementary school.

07:11.931 --> 07:15.284
<i>- It's public, but it's alternative.
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.</i>

07:15.319 --> 07:18.638
I don't know. I think...
I think you should meet her.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.938
I would love to,
if you don't mind.

07:20.973 --> 07:24.966
If it works out, you'd have
to be willing to relocate, though.

07:25.011 --> 07:29.004
Hmm. Where is it?

07:42.662 --> 07:46.230
<i>Come here!</i>

07:46.265 --> 07:49.133
<i>Damn, man!</i>

07:49.168 --> 07:52.470
Hey! Do what you're doing, man!

07:52.505 --> 07:54.207
- You trying to kill me?
- Watch it, fool!

07:54.242 --> 07:58.044
Welcome to East Harlem.

08:10.122 --> 08:14.093
<i>Aside from half
a term in a private school...</i>

08:14.128 --> 08:16.494
in Greece...

08:16.529 --> 08:19.198
and a year teaching chorus
in Hawaii ten years ago...

08:19.233 --> 08:22.066
That's... the Navy.
They move you around.

08:22.101 --> 08:26.094
<i>Um... it doesn't look as if you've
had any other teaching experience.</i>

08:26.739 --> 08:30.309
Well, not traditional
teaching experience, but I have, um...

08:30.344 --> 08:34.302
<i>- Uh, I've given private lessons.
- Oh.</i>

08:34.679 --> 08:37.316
That's not on there. I...

08:37.351 --> 08:41.308
I taught my sons.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.956
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Demetras.

08:44.991 --> 08:48.984
Brian spoke highly of you, and I told him
I would consider starting a violin class.

08:49.128 --> 08:52.096
<i>But without
the proper qualifications...</i>

08:52.131 --> 08:56.124
and without any experience
in inner-city schools...

08:56.702 --> 09:00.695
I'm very sorry.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.010
Okay.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.197
Thank you for seeing me.

09:08.232 --> 09:10.349
You're quite welcome.

09:31.370 --> 09:34.757
<i>What I did is change the 8:45 to 9:45...</i>

09:34.792 --> 09:38.109
<i>to 8:45 to 9:30...</i>

09:38.144 --> 09:40.978
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

09:41.013 --> 09:45.006
<i>- Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt. I wanted you to meet my boys.
- I'm sorry, Janet.</i>

09:45.051 --> 09:46.719
<i>- This is Nick.
- Hi. - Hi.</i>

09:46.754 --> 09:48.853
<i>- And Lexi.
- Hi.</i>

09:48.888 --> 09:52.223
I'm sorry. Hi. Oh, I'm Roberta
Guaspari-Demetras.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.989
Dennis Rouche, our music
teacher and program coordinator.

09:56.024 --> 09:59.721
Mrs. Demetras, did I not
make myself clear yesterday?

09:59.899 --> 10:03.736
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
I just wanted to show you something.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.270
Just take a second.
Ready, boys?

10:06.305 --> 10:10.298
Are we having a talent show?
I should have brought my tap shoes.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.903
Five, six,
ready, and...

10:49.248 --> 10:53.085
Beautiful. Beautiful.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.853
Oh...

10:55.888 --> 10:58.823
- Will you hire her now?
- Oh!

10:58.858 --> 11:02.161
<i>Uh... how long
have you boys been playing?</i>

11:02.196 --> 11:04.481
- Since I was three.
- And you?

11:04.516 --> 11:06.731
Maybe since I was
three and a half.

11:06.766 --> 11:09.168
Your mom must be
a pretty good teacher, huh?

11:09.203 --> 11:11.235
<i>She's okay.</i>

11:11.270 --> 11:14.106
Nick... That's right.
You guys wait out there.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.907
- Okay, so...
- Mrs. Demetras, if you could...

11:16.942 --> 11:20.935
<i>teach our students to play as well
as they do, I-I'd be thrilled, but...</i>

11:21.947 --> 11:24.950
I could. Any child can learn
to play the violin.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.053
Assuming they have
the discipline.

11:27.088 --> 11:29.086
I would teach them
to have discipline.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.390
Mrs. Demetras, a lot of our parents
are struggling...

11:31.425 --> 11:33.357
to feed their kids,
to pay the rent.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.394
They don't have time
to help them learn violin.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.361
Well, they wouldn't have to.
They wouldn't have to.

11:37.396 --> 11:41.389
It would be great if they wanted to help,
but these kids are going to be committed.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.271
They would practice on their own, and
they'd help each other in the classroom.

11:45.306 --> 11:48.307
I think I know these students,
Miss Demetras.

11:48.342 --> 11:50.241
<i>- Mrs.
- Mrs. Demetras.</i>

11:50.276 --> 11:53.077
And I can tell you right now,

11:53.112 --> 11:56.315
their attention span
doesn't go past do, re, mi.

11:56.350 --> 11:59.285
Maybe on a good day,
I can get them to fa.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.253
I think you're
underestimating them.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.124
<i>They can learn to play
as well as any other kids.</i>

12:05.159 --> 12:08.294
- That I'd like to see.
- Well, you will.

12:08.329 --> 12:12.176
Or you would... if...

12:12.211 --> 12:16.024
I'll tell you what...

12:16.869 --> 12:19.004
I'll put you down as a sub.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.105
<i>For now.</i>

12:21.140 --> 12:23.874
<i>- Thank you very much.
- But even if it works out,</i>

12:23.909 --> 12:26.479
the board may not let me create
a permanent position for you.

12:26.514 --> 12:28.446
That's okay. Anything is okay.
That's great.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.050
- I have already planned out the whole term.
- Oh, thank you very much.

12:31.085 --> 12:32.883
<i>- Yes!
- There is no room for this.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:35.888
<i>Besides, where are you gonna
find money for violins?</i>

12:35.923 --> 12:38.889
Oh, you need violins?

12:38.924 --> 12:42.917
I have violins. I have 50 violins.

12:44.196 --> 12:48.200
Thank you very much.
Nice to meet you, Mr...

12:48.235 --> 12:51.135
- Rouche.
- Rouche. Th-Thank you.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.738
<i>Okay. Lucy?</i>

12:53.773 --> 12:56.909
<i>Hey, let's go get one!
Come on! Come on!</i>

12:56.944 --> 12:59.510
I want one!
Give it to me, now!

12:59.545 --> 13:02.246
- Come on, I want one! Come on!
- Please, don't open...

13:02.281 --> 13:05.518
Don't open the cases, okay, everybody?
Don't open the cases.

13:05.553 --> 13:07.218
<i>No guns.</i>

13:07.253 --> 13:11.246
Okay, now...
listen to me, please!

13:11.290 --> 13:14.860
<i>- I don't like this one.
- No, no! Please, keep them closed!</i>

13:14.895 --> 13:18.496
Stop it, you two.
You two, what did I just say?

13:18.531 --> 13:21.967
Stop! No, no, please, don't. Don't.
No, no, no. No, no, no, please.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.982
<i>Just put them back
in the case, all right?</i>

13:25.017 --> 13:27.962
Who's plucking?
Who's plucking my violin? Hey!

13:29.008 --> 13:31.142
Please, will you put it back
in the case right now?

13:31.177 --> 13:35.170
<i>Good. Okay. So today I'm going
to be dividing you all up...</i>

13:35.514 --> 13:39.507
<i>into five different classes.</i>

13:46.091 --> 13:50.084
Hello.
Come with me.

13:51.197 --> 13:55.190
You're gonna be the first student
who is not in my violin class, okay?

13:55.467 --> 13:58.370
<i>I want you to go
to the office right now.</i>

13:58.405 --> 14:00.504
Right now.
Out, out, out.

14:00.539 --> 14:04.375
Go on, go on, go on.
Out, out.

14:04.410 --> 14:08.403
<i>Who wants to be next?</i>

14:09.548 --> 14:13.419
Who wants to be kicked out
of my class?

14:13.454 --> 14:15.519
<i>Are you raising
your hand...</i>

14:15.554 --> 14:18.122
<i>- because you want to be kicked out?
- Yeah.</i>

14:18.157 --> 14:21.961
- Wh-Why? - I don't want to
learn about no stupid violins.

14:21.996 --> 14:25.596
Man, violin's for wimps.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.365
<i>- Who told you that?
- Nobody.</i>

14:28.400 --> 14:30.352
<i>- I just know.
- What's your name?</i>

14:30.387 --> 14:32.269
<i>- DeSean.
- Well, DeSean...</i>

14:32.304 --> 14:36.297
you didn't give me
a good enough reason, so you're staying.

14:40.179 --> 14:44.172
Anybody else?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.855
Very nice.
Everybody be quiet.

14:49.890 --> 14:53.092
<i>I'm gonna hand out
the violins.</i>

14:53.127 --> 14:55.361
Hey, I play pretty good.

14:55.396 --> 14:57.596
Yeah, see how easy it is?

15:02.268 --> 15:04.235
That's great.
You know what?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.237
In the spring, maybe,
we can have a big concert...

15:06.272 --> 15:09.708
- and invite all your families
and the whole school.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.976
Huh?
That would be great.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.346
- What's your name, honey?
- Naeem.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.682
Naeem. Okay, you can
sit down, Naeem.

15:16.717 --> 15:19.617
You're gonna be
a quarter size.

15:19.652 --> 15:23.355
<i>Yeah, and if you guys do exactly
what I tell you, if you listen to me,</i>

15:23.390 --> 15:25.356
you're gonna sound beautiful
in the concert,

15:25.391 --> 15:28.460
and you're gonna feel so proud
of yourselves, you know?

15:28.495 --> 15:30.361
<i>But if you don't
listen to me,</i>

15:30.396 --> 15:33.232
<i>you're gonna sound so bad your own
parents will get sick when they hear you.</i>

15:33.267 --> 15:35.668
They might even throw up.

15:35.703 --> 15:39.661
I'm serious.

15:43.609 --> 15:47.602
<i>- You decent?
- Yeah.</i>

15:48.714 --> 15:51.900
- What's this?
- A toast.

15:51.935 --> 15:55.052
- A toast?
- To Roberta...

15:55.087 --> 15:59.080
- for making it through the first week.
- Ah.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.628
I'm proud of you.

16:04.663 --> 16:08.200
I really appreciate everything
you've done for us. I really do.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.971
I swear to you...
I promise, this weekend,

16:12.006 --> 16:14.071
I will start looking
for a place.

16:14.106 --> 16:18.110
There's no rush, really.
No rush. It's...

16:18.145 --> 16:20.210
No, you've done enough.

16:20.245 --> 16:24.238
You should be writing
and not baby-sitting us.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.090
I've been reading your book.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.372
- I think it's really great. Yeah.
- Oh?

16:36.407 --> 16:39.620
It's really good.
It's such powerful stuff.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.601
Wow.
Yeah?

16:44.636 --> 16:48.238
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you.

16:48.273 --> 16:52.277
Um, so the next one
is on migrant workers?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.979
Yeah.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.833
How do you know how you...
What...

16:57.868 --> 17:00.617
What you're gonna
write about next?

17:00.652 --> 17:04.645
- I mean, how do you...
- I just follow my gut.

17:05.223 --> 17:09.217
Pay attention to...

17:10.162 --> 17:12.564
what I'm being drawn to.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.566
What...

17:15.601 --> 17:19.594
What are you doing?

17:29.681 --> 17:33.674
I've been wanting to do that
since Mr. Duvane's orchestra class.

17:37.823 --> 17:40.557
You never noticed me
in that class.

17:40.592 --> 17:44.585
Oh, you... You completely ignored me.
You used to drive me wild.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.201
You had like
five different girlfriends.

17:49.236 --> 17:53.194
I never had
the one I wanted.

17:57.443 --> 18:01.436
That Roberta
isn't around anymore.

18:07.586 --> 18:11.579
I don't believe you.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.494
- No, I can't... I-I shouldn't.
- Why?

18:17.529 --> 18:20.532
- Because the boys are...
- They're sleeping.

18:20.567 --> 18:24.525
Yeah.
Oh, man, I'm still married.

18:25.104 --> 18:29.097
And what's your husband
doing right now?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.690
Oh, my God.
The boys.

18:44.725 --> 18:47.224
It's okay.

18:47.259 --> 18:51.252
They're still sleeping.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.800
Where are you going?

18:54.835 --> 18:58.793
Uh... Texas.

18:59.905 --> 19:03.898
What?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.096
What's in Texas?

19:08.131 --> 19:10.347
Farm workers.

19:10.382 --> 19:13.752
My research grant?
I just got the call. It came through.

19:13.787 --> 19:15.519
Wow.

19:15.554 --> 19:18.490
I've got some families lined up there,
and then I go on to California.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.093
How long
are you gonna be gone?

19:21.128 --> 19:24.263
I don't know.
Two, three months.

19:24.298 --> 19:27.450
I thought
you would be around.

19:27.485 --> 19:30.602
I... Um...
And last night...

19:30.637 --> 19:33.370
Roberta...

19:33.405 --> 19:36.291
last night was great,
but what did you think?

19:36.326 --> 19:39.178
We were gonna get married
in the morning?

19:39.213 --> 19:41.778
No, I didn't think that.

19:41.813 --> 19:45.806
I just... We just got here,
and I barely even...

19:46.418 --> 19:48.620
I don't even know
where to buy groceries.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.654
You're gonna be fine.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.058
You have a job,
a place to stay,

19:53.093 --> 19:55.392
your kids have
a school to go to,

19:55.427 --> 19:59.420
and there's a D'Agastino's
right around the corner.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.569
What am I doing
right now?

20:05.604 --> 20:08.306
- Rosining the bow.
- Rosining the bow. That's right.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.009
And what am I doing when I tighten
this little screw,

20:11.044 --> 20:12.976
when I turn it like this?

20:13.011 --> 20:15.180
Tightening the horsehair.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.314
Everybody, be quiet.
Naeem?

20:17.349 --> 20:21.342
- Tightening the horsehair.
- The horsehair. That's right. Okay, what do we call this?

20:21.453 --> 20:24.388
<i>What is this called?</i>

20:24.423 --> 20:27.326
<i>Bird was shooting
them threes, man. Bird was...</i>

20:27.361 --> 20:30.260
<i>- DeSean? DeSean?
- Yeah.</i>

20:30.295 --> 20:32.796
<i>- What is this called?
- I don't know.</i>

20:32.831 --> 20:34.731
<i>- Yes, you do. Why not?
- I wasn't here.</i>

20:34.766 --> 20:38.570
You were here, but you weren't paying attention.
You want people to think you're stupid?

20:38.605 --> 20:41.605
<i>Okay, you can tell him, Naeem.</i>

20:41.640 --> 20:45.010
<i>- It's called the frog.
- It's called the frog. That's right.</i>

20:45.045 --> 20:47.678
Okay, anybody remember
what this is?

20:47.713 --> 20:50.449
Lucy, do you like it when people snap
their fingers when you talk?

20:50.484 --> 20:54.442
Yeah.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.486
<i>"D," "D," "D," "D."</i>

20:56.521 --> 20:59.958
<i>"E," "E," "E," "E."</i>

20:59.993 --> 21:02.878
"D," "D," "D," "D."

21:02.913 --> 21:05.473
<i>"C," "C," "C," "C,"</i>

21:05.508 --> 21:08.122
"D," "D," "D," "D."

21:08.157 --> 21:10.581
"E," "E," "E," "E."

21:10.616 --> 21:12.970
"D," "D," "D," "D."

21:13.005 --> 21:15.005
<i>Excuse me.</i>

21:15.040 --> 21:17.241
<i>- I'm sorry.
- No talking!</i>

21:17.276 --> 21:21.269
- I was supposed to collect kids
from Miss Cooper's classroom...

21:21.613 --> 21:24.716
for my 10:00 class,
and there's nobody there.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.784
Miss Cooper's students
have Phys Ed on Tuesdays.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.653
<i>But you scheduled them for violin.</i>

21:29.688 --> 21:33.558
You must have read
the schedule wrong.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.760
I don't think so.

21:36.795 --> 21:40.788
Well, I can't solve this problem
for you right now.

21:40.899 --> 21:42.968
I'm trying to teach.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.639
So am I.

21:51.043 --> 21:54.611
May we continue, please?

21:54.646 --> 21:56.747
<i>"C," "C," "C"...</i>

21:56.782 --> 22:00.118
- But I thought all the teachers agreed to this.
- In theory.

22:00.153 --> 22:03.121
Adam, I want to see you
in my office after lunch.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.088
- What did I do?
- Think about it.

22:05.123 --> 22:07.592
Look, whenever you pull
the students out, it's a disruption.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.559
Plus, it's extra work
on the teachers...

22:09.594 --> 22:11.962
because they have to fill
the kids in on what they missed.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.000
- Some of the teachers resent it.
- But can't you talk to them?

22:15.035 --> 22:18.582
Look, I pulled this
off a second-grader this morning.

22:18.617 --> 22:22.129
I'll help you, Roberta,
but I cannot hold your hand.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.013
I want everybody to put
your right foot on a tile,

22:28.048 --> 22:30.080
and then you put
your left foot on a line.

22:30.115 --> 22:33.717
See? Because we're trying
to make a box with our feet.

22:33.752 --> 22:37.745
- Lucy, do you want to leave
the class right now?

22:38.623 --> 22:41.858
Yeah, because I'm trying
to make you stand strong. See?

22:41.893 --> 22:45.886
So strong and balanced that if I tried
to push you over, I couldn't do it.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.598
- See?
- Michael Jordan’s pretty good, though.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.635
If you were standing strong,
I couldn't push you...

22:50.670 --> 22:54.628
Hey, DeSean. Hey, James.
Now, cut it out.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.875
Anybody seen Naeem?

22:58.910 --> 23:02.447
- I saw him this morning, but he's not here.
- I know he's not here.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.467
That's why I asked you. See?

23:05.502 --> 23:08.418
Okay, good.

23:08.453 --> 23:10.754
<i>You're not standing strong.</i>

23:10.789 --> 23:14.782
See? See how I could push you?
That's because your feet are not...

23:16.194 --> 23:19.062
centered.

23:19.097 --> 23:22.999
<i>Somebody bring me
a chair, okay?</i>

23:23.034 --> 23:27.027
<i>Guadalupe, I think it would be
a good idea for you to sit, okay?</i>

23:29.040 --> 23:33.033
Thank you, DeSean.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.649
Now, who can I yell at?

23:37.684 --> 23:39.983
Hey, Naeem!

23:40.018 --> 23:42.853
Where were you today?

23:42.888 --> 23:45.190
I can't be involved
in class anymore.

23:45.225 --> 23:47.492
<i>- Why not?
- My mother won't let me.</i>

23:47.527 --> 23:50.494
Why?

23:50.529 --> 23:54.499
My son's got more important things
to do than learn dead white men's music.

23:54.534 --> 23:57.736
They're gonna learn
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

23:57.771 --> 24:00.890
How many black classical
composers can you name?

24:00.925 --> 24:03.901
How many black classical
violinists do you know?

24:03.936 --> 24:06.742
That doesn't mean
that's the way it should be.

24:06.777 --> 24:09.246
I mean, Naeem's learning
how to play music.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.681
Maybe it makes him
feel good about himself.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.885
<i>- What does it matter who wrote it?
- Please, Ma.</i>

24:13.920 --> 24:16.853
Can I be in the class?

24:16.888 --> 24:19.689
Look, I've seen this before.

24:19.724 --> 24:23.595
You white women come up here and think you
can rescue our poor inner-city children...

24:23.630 --> 24:26.097
who never asked to be rescued
in the first place.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.099
No thank you.

24:28.134 --> 24:32.092
Come on.

24:32.871 --> 24:36.864
Don't look back at her.
Turn your head around.

24:43.882 --> 24:46.879
Shit.

24:46.914 --> 24:49.877
Hello?

24:54.826 --> 24:57.896
Where are you?

25:00.565 --> 25:03.735
Are you still with her?

25:08.139 --> 25:10.106
Oh, God.

25:10.141 --> 25:12.242
<i>We've all
missed you so much.</i>

25:12.277 --> 25:16.270
<i>The boys and me... We're gonna be
so happy when you come back.</i>

25:16.615 --> 25:20.608
<i>I promise it will be better.
I... I...</i>

25:20.886 --> 25:24.120
<i>What?</i>

25:24.155 --> 25:27.893
<i>Well... What? I thought you said
that you and Lana...</i>

25:27.928 --> 25:31.728
<i>You were...
That was all over.</i>

25:31.763 --> 25:35.756
<i>Charles? Charles?</i>

25:48.780 --> 25:50.747
Mm-hmm.

25:50.782 --> 25:52.967
Yeah, that was it, you know?

25:53.002 --> 25:55.529
No explanation.
No discussion.

25:55.564 --> 25:58.021
No... anything.
He just...

25:58.056 --> 26:01.224
He basically didn't even want
to talk about it.

26:01.259 --> 26:05.230
- Just "I want a divorce. Good-bye."
- I know it's hard.

26:05.265 --> 26:07.197
You're gonna
get through this.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.699
You will.
You'll survive this. You will.

26:09.734 --> 26:13.271
I'm gonna take the boys
and move back to my mom's.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.572
What?

26:15.607 --> 26:19.600
You're gonna quit teaching
in the middle of the term?

26:19.844 --> 26:22.746
Well, I just...
I don't fit in there.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.183
I'm not making any progress
with those kids.

26:25.218 --> 26:27.217
What are you gonna tell Janet?

26:27.252 --> 26:31.245
Huh? Your husband left you,
nothing else matters?

26:33.158 --> 26:37.151
I don't know.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.671
<i>My mother gave it to me.</i>

26:47.706 --> 26:50.842
- Why would she give you $50?
- To buy breakfast.

26:50.877 --> 26:53.643
<i>Do you know how hard
your mother works?</i>

26:53.678 --> 26:55.745
- Yeah.
- Do you think it's right to steal from her?

26:55.780 --> 26:59.184
- I didn't.
- Why don't we go to my office and call her and ask her?

26:59.219 --> 27:01.186
- Come on.
- I need to talk to you.

27:01.221 --> 27:03.687
It will have to wait.

27:03.722 --> 27:07.715
- It's important.
- Take a number.

27:17.435 --> 27:20.939
Guadalupe,
what are you doing here?

27:20.974 --> 27:22.973
I can't keep
my bow straight.

27:23.008 --> 27:27.001
Well, honey, your teacher
must be looking for you.

27:31.449 --> 27:35.442
Here.
I can't come anymore.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.922
It's too hard.

27:38.957 --> 27:41.960
The violin is hard
for everybody.

27:41.995 --> 27:44.963
But everyone
is better than me.

27:44.998 --> 27:48.956
I'll always be...
weaker.

27:51.369 --> 27:54.738
Did you ever hear
of Itzhak Perlman?

27:54.773 --> 27:58.766
- No.
- He's one of the greatest violinists in the whole world.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.913
He has problems
with his legs too.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.381
He has to use
two canes to walk,

28:04.416 --> 28:07.784
but he still makes
the most beautiful music.

28:07.819 --> 28:10.855
- And he sits down when he plays?
- Yeah, he has to.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.824
He was your student?

28:14.859 --> 28:18.852
No, but if he were, I would tell him
the same thing I'm telling you.

28:22.734 --> 28:26.727
You shouldn't quit something
just 'cause it's hard.

28:28.006 --> 28:31.999
But I can't stand strong.

28:37.782 --> 28:41.775
Standing strong doesn't mean
just using your legs.

28:44.189 --> 28:47.459
You can stand strong
on the inside.

28:47.494 --> 28:51.452
You know what I mean?

29:11.416 --> 29:14.851
- Hi. Want to sit?
- Mm-mm.

29:14.886 --> 29:18.879
<i>- That's the sub I was talking about.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

29:19.190 --> 29:22.026
What's the matter, you got
cooties or something?

29:22.061 --> 29:24.994
Oh, apparently.

29:25.029 --> 29:28.894
Well, I'll take my chances.
Isabel Vasquez, second grade.

29:28.929 --> 29:32.760
- Hi, I'm Roberta Guaspari.
- The violin teacher. I know.

29:33.371 --> 29:37.006
Is it my imagination
or does everybody here hate me?

29:37.041 --> 29:39.409
Look, it's hard to fit in when
you're doing a special program.

29:39.444 --> 29:43.437
People figure you're not gonna be here
long, so they don't make the effort.

29:43.848 --> 29:47.185
It may take a while for folks
to warm up, but they don't hate you.

29:47.220 --> 29:50.053
What about Alice Cooper?

29:50.088 --> 29:54.081
<i>- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- A: She thinks the violin is a waste of time.</i>

29:55.894 --> 29:59.887
She's a bitch.

30:01.566 --> 30:05.403
So why are you
being so nice to me?

30:05.438 --> 30:08.037
Ulterior motives.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.408
I want my daughter
in your class next year.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.612
If I'm here next year.

30:14.647 --> 30:18.605
You will be.

30:21.953 --> 30:25.456
<i>Is just for you and your boys?</i>

30:27.492 --> 30:31.060
Yes.

30:31.095 --> 30:34.098
No husband?
No boyfriends?

30:34.133 --> 30:37.101
No. No.

30:39.237 --> 30:43.230
<i>I'll-I'll take it.</i>

30:48.046 --> 30:53.941
Slow bows. Slow bows.
Don't squeeze.

30:56.020 --> 31:00.013
<i>Oh, man. Stop.
Everybody, stop, stop, stop.</i>

31:00.191 --> 31:02.992
DeSean, how much have you
practiced this week?

31:03.027 --> 31:05.980
My asthma... It was very bad.
I had to go to the hospital.

31:06.015 --> 31:08.933
Again? You told me you had
to go to the hospital last week.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.970
Oh, yeah.
Maybe it was last week.

31:12.005 --> 31:14.571
Uh-huh.

31:14.606 --> 31:18.409
What about you, Lucy? You sounded
the worst of all. Have you practiced?

31:18.444 --> 31:20.343
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

31:20.378 --> 31:23.081
You can't be in this class
if you do not practice.

31:23.116 --> 31:26.082
My grandma got mugged.

31:26.117 --> 31:30.088
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is she okay?

31:30.123 --> 31:34.081
She died.

31:35.360 --> 31:39.353
Oh... Lucy, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

31:42.500 --> 31:46.493
Just do the best you can,
okay?

31:51.643 --> 31:54.344
<i>- Good night, Roberta.
- Hey... good night.</i>

31:54.379 --> 31:57.515
- See you tomorrow.
- You ready? All right, we'll see you.

31:57.550 --> 32:01.508
Let's go.

32:11.396 --> 32:14.430
- Hey, Naeem.
- Hi, Roberta.

32:14.465 --> 32:17.400
Hey, can I talk
to your mama for a second?

32:17.435 --> 32:21.428
I just wanted to tell you that I didn't
come up here to rescue anybody.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.540
I'm a single mother,
and I needed the job.

32:24.575 --> 32:28.568
And I know you think you're protecting
your son, but you're not.

32:29.347 --> 32:32.650
I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's
mother said he couldn't play tennis...

32:32.685 --> 32:35.051
because it's
a white man's game?

32:35.086 --> 32:37.522
<i>You know, the important
thing is Naeem.</i>

32:37.557 --> 32:39.622
When he plays music,

32:39.657 --> 32:43.650
his whole face lights up.

32:47.098 --> 32:51.091
You should see that.

33:20.398 --> 33:22.700
What's up?

33:22.735 --> 33:24.968
You are.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.996
I was thirsty.

33:31.075 --> 33:33.244
<i>Remember in Greece
we could see the ocean?</i>

33:33.279 --> 33:36.379
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

33:36.414 --> 33:40.407
- And the fishing boats and...
- And the octopuses.

33:40.651 --> 33:43.486
Yeah.

33:43.521 --> 33:47.514
Um, is Daddy
coming here soon?

33:52.663 --> 33:56.656
Well... that's something...

33:57.101 --> 34:01.094
I was wanting
to talk to you about.

34:04.208 --> 34:08.201
Daddy isn't gonna live
with us anymore.

34:10.348 --> 34:14.341
Um... you and Lexi
are gonna see him;

34:16.219 --> 34:20.213
special times like Christmas and,
you know, summers.

34:23.360 --> 34:27.353
Um... can you tell
a birthday story?

34:28.232 --> 34:31.235
Don't you want to talk
about what I just said?

34:31.270 --> 34:35.228
I want to hear
the birthday story.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.042
Okay.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.478
Um...

34:42.513 --> 34:45.649
You know, it was
your grandpa's birthday,

34:45.684 --> 34:48.887
and I was a little
bit sad because...

34:48.922 --> 34:51.723
because he had died
a couple months back.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.525
- But you knew I'd be born that day.
- Yeah.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.627
So I packed,
and I got ready.

34:57.662 --> 35:01.655
- Then Daddy left.
- Daddy left, yeah.

35:01.732 --> 35:05.336
He didn't believe me because I said,
"This is my dad's birthday.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.870
This baby
is gonna be born today."

35:07.905 --> 35:10.908
But he didn't believe you,
but I was born...

35:10.943 --> 35:13.911
- You sure were.
- On the same day as Grandpa.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.878
That's right.

35:15.913 --> 35:19.906
It was a happy day.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.486
Was Daddy happy too?

35:22.521 --> 35:24.720
Of course he was.

35:24.755 --> 35:28.748
Then why is he leaving me?

35:31.229 --> 35:33.896
Well, he's not
leaving you, Nick.

35:33.931 --> 35:37.924
I mean, he loves you,
and he loves Lexi very, very much.

35:39.370 --> 35:43.363
Then why
can't he live with us?

35:47.778 --> 35:51.771
It's just sometimes things
h-happen between...

35:52.650 --> 35:56.643
Grown-ups...

35:57.255 --> 35:59.922
that are very hard
to understand.

35:59.957 --> 36:03.950
They can't...
They just can't be together.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.779
- I need to buy some...
- Mommy, come look!

36:21.814 --> 36:23.746
What?

36:23.781 --> 36:27.351
What are you...
Oh, my God, you're killing me.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.452
- What's this?
- A dog.

36:29.487 --> 36:33.289
- What is this?
- Mom, look, look at her. She's so cute.

36:33.324 --> 36:36.325
<i>- Right? Can we get her?
- No. We're not getting a dog, no.</i>

36:36.360 --> 36:39.764
<i>- She could stay with us. No, you don't have to...
- No, but... Yeah, but...</i>

36:39.799 --> 36:42.331
Okay.

36:42.366 --> 36:46.359
Now we're all gonna take turns
cleaning up after this puppy, right?

36:47.205 --> 36:51.198
Uh, absolutely.

36:51.943 --> 36:55.936
Yeah, right.

36:57.915 --> 37:00.284
You're on the wrong string,
Becky.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.653
<i>I've only told you
this 14 times.</i>

37:02.688 --> 37:05.188
Look at your nails.

37:05.223 --> 37:11.429
You're supposed to cut them
for violin... I've told you th...

37:11.464 --> 37:13.796
That sounds terrible!

37:13.831 --> 37:15.965
<i>You're gonna make
your parents sick.</i>

37:16.000 --> 37:19.136
Is this
an important question, Tanisha?

37:19.171 --> 37:22.238
- What?
- Do you have two of those skirts?

37:22.273 --> 37:26.266
- Huh?
- You wore one just like that on Monday.

37:26.377 --> 37:30.370
- All right, I don't think that's
such an important question.

37:30.681 --> 37:34.674
<i>Let's try it again.</i>

37:39.056 --> 37:43.049
Okay, just practice
on the fingerboards silently.

37:49.300 --> 37:53.293
Naeem and I were wondering
if he could still be in the class?

37:56.941 --> 38:00.934
Well, I would love that.

38:01.312 --> 38:03.279
You've got a lot
of catching up to do.

38:03.314 --> 38:06.882
- You think you can work that hard?
- Yeah, I can.

38:06.917 --> 38:10.910
Okay. But I can also arrange for
some private lessons at my apartment.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.758
I wouldn't be able
to afford that.

38:13.793 --> 38:16.692
That's okay.

38:16.727 --> 38:19.363
Why don't you go get a spare violin
and see if you can remember...

38:19.398 --> 38:23.356
how to set it up.

38:27.371 --> 38:31.364
Okay, let's try it again, shall we?

38:32.376 --> 38:34.343
- Yes.
- Come on out, Naeem.

38:34.378 --> 38:38.371
See if you can remember
how to do that. All right.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.651
- You're shouting at them all the time!
- I'm not shouting all the time!

38:40.686 --> 38:42.618
Just when
they don't listen.

38:42.653 --> 38:46.568
- They have to listen to me.
- Didn't you tell them they were making their parents sick?

38:46.603 --> 38:50.483
<i>I did say... But I didn't say it
exactly that way.</i>

38:51.362 --> 38:55.355
I'm raising Becky
in a supportive atmosphere.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.602
<i>- I don't send her to school to be abused.
- I'm trying to teach discipline.</i>

38:58.637 --> 39:01.337
<i>That's all. If you want to take
a very difficult instrument,</i>

39:01.372 --> 39:04.875
you have to take it seriously, you have
to focus, you have to pay attention...

39:04.910 --> 39:08.868
<i>I think what Mrs. Lamb
is trying to say, Roberta,</i>

39:09.113 --> 39:12.848
is that you are
a little too harsh,

39:12.883 --> 39:16.876
but I'm sure you might be able
to soften your comments to the children.

39:19.056 --> 39:22.893
<i>I don't believe we have an impossible
situation here, now do you?</i>

39:22.928 --> 39:25.963
Mm-mm. No, that's...
I can do that.

39:25.998 --> 39:27.631
Good.

39:43.147 --> 39:47.084
<i>Okay, that's enough.
Thank you.</i>

39:54.091 --> 39:58.084
Well, that was...
pretty good.

39:58.863 --> 40:00.996
<i>That was...
not so bad.</i>

40:01.031 --> 40:04.568
It wasn't?
I thought we stunk.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.569
Well...

40:06.604 --> 40:08.571
<i>I wouldn't
put it that way.</i>

40:08.606 --> 40:10.841
I would just say
that some people...

40:10.876 --> 40:13.973
could maybe practice
a little bit more.

40:14.008 --> 40:17.070
James, did you practice
at all this week?

40:17.848 --> 40:21.841
Okay, well, perhaps you could try
a little harder for next week, okay?

40:22.987 --> 40:25.873
<i>Good. Because all you got
to do is your best.</i>

40:25.908 --> 40:28.759
<i>Roberta, why are you
acting like that?</i>

40:28.794 --> 40:32.128
- Like what?
- Like nice.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.164
<i>- Well, don't you want a nice teacher?
- I already got nice teachers.</i>

40:35.199 --> 40:39.192
- You added some variety.
- Yeah, we like you better the way you used to be.

40:45.976 --> 40:49.969
I agree. This is even worse.
You're acting weird now.

40:53.117 --> 40:57.110
Okay, I take it all back.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.456
You stunk!
You all stunk!

41:00.491 --> 41:04.484
<i>- Don't tell your parents
that I said that, okay?</i>

41:04.995 --> 41:06.962
- Okay.
- Let's do it again.

41:06.997 --> 41:09.765
<i>Right this time.
Stand up straight.</i>

41:09.800 --> 41:12.803
<i>Make the box with your feet.
Come on, tabletops up.</i>

41:12.838 --> 41:14.772
<i>Stop sign. Beautiful.
Let's go.</i>

41:14.807 --> 41:17.870
Five, six, seven, and...

41:17.905 --> 41:20.934
Tempo, tempo, tempo!

41:23.814 --> 41:26.250
<i>Don't open the presents,
all right, on the airplane.</i>

41:26.285 --> 41:29.698
It's time to board.
Time to go.

41:29.733 --> 41:33.112
Okay, gotta go.
Hugs, hugs, hugs.

41:33.257 --> 41:36.525
I'll take good care of them.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.697
- Can't you come with us, please?
- Oh, baby, I told you.

41:39.732 --> 41:43.690
This is Daddy's
special time with you.

41:46.804 --> 41:52.765
Bye.

41:54.245 --> 41:58.238
Bye, Nick!

42:21.939 --> 42:25.932
<i>Oh, Tom Sawyer
is drying out too.</i>

42:27.811 --> 42:30.781
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

42:30.816 --> 42:33.782
How did you happen
to fall in?

42:33.817 --> 42:36.620
<i>- I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.</i>

42:36.655 --> 42:40.222
What? To save me?

42:40.257 --> 42:43.561
- Who is it?
- You didn't go through with it, did you?

42:43.596 --> 42:45.628
- Through with what?
- Suicide.

42:45.663 --> 42:49.656
<i>- It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.</i>

42:54.905 --> 42:57.341
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

42:59.977 --> 43:03.646
<i>- Oh!
- Merry Christmas!</i>

43:03.681 --> 43:07.016
- I'm back.
- You're back. Oh, God.

43:07.051 --> 43:10.154
<i>- Hut, hut, hike! - I
gotcha, I gotcha! - I'm open!</i>

43:10.189 --> 43:14.147
<i>Touchdown!</i>

43:14.325 --> 43:17.211
- First down and ten now!
- Okay.

43:17.246 --> 43:20.062
That's it.
Enough goofing off.

43:20.097 --> 43:22.631
- Back to work, everybody.
- Hey, no fair.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.836
- Everybody.
- What are you trying to do, kill me?

43:25.871 --> 43:28.938
<i>You're wearing me out.</i>

43:28.973 --> 43:32.207
- I'll wear you out.
- You already did that last night.

43:32.242 --> 43:36.235
The only one in the entire coffee shop
not speaking Spanish. Boys, lunch.

43:38.782 --> 43:42.775
<i>Oh, my... Gunshots. You hear that?</i>

43:42.953 --> 43:44.955
How you gonna live here
by yourself?

43:44.990 --> 43:47.222
That's a truck backfire, Ma.

43:47.257 --> 43:51.250
I work in this neighborhood,
and I want to live here too.

43:52.863 --> 43:54.898
<i>Say hello
to the next-door neighbor, Assunta.</i>

43:54.933 --> 43:57.766
<i>He won't bite.</i>

43:57.801 --> 44:00.570
- What's your name?
- Lawrence.

44:00.605 --> 44:03.305
- Are you hungry, Lawrence?
- Yes.

44:03.340 --> 44:06.076
<i>Do you want half of mine,
and I'll have half of yours?</i>

44:06.111 --> 44:08.978
<i>- Okay?
- Lawrence?</i>

44:09.013 --> 44:12.781
- Come sit with us.
- Hey, get in here.

44:12.816 --> 44:16.619
<i>- Why did you let her buy this house?
- "Let her"?</i>

44:16.654 --> 44:18.956
Your daughter does what she wants,
in case you haven't noticed.

44:18.991 --> 44:22.949
I noticed.

44:23.794 --> 44:27.297
- I just don't understand the rush.
- I want my own home.

44:27.332 --> 44:30.801
I've been living on Navy bases
since the day I got married.

44:30.836 --> 44:33.037
The boys don't have a dad.
They can have a home.

44:33.072 --> 44:35.239
But if you invested
your divorce settlement,

44:35.274 --> 44:37.773
you could buy
a nice house someday.

44:37.808 --> 44:43.147
Bad enough you're living
in this neighborhood.

44:43.182 --> 44:47.140
Please stop, okay?

44:54.825 --> 44:58.490
I'm sorry. I am.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44:58.525 --> 45:02.155
Forgive me. I love you.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.700
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

45:04.735 --> 45:08.303
Things keep
going as well as they have been,

45:08.338 --> 45:12.331
- eventually, I'm sure,
Brian will move in with me.

45:12.743 --> 45:14.945
And how much do you know
about that man?

45:14.980 --> 45:17.312
He's a good person,
you know?

45:17.347 --> 45:20.017
He's...
He's been a big help to me.

45:20.052 --> 45:22.718
<i>He's great
with the boys.</i>

45:22.753 --> 45:26.746
Just don't want you to make
the same mistake twice, Roberta.

45:27.858 --> 45:30.043
You barely knew Charles,
and you married him.

45:30.078 --> 45:32.194
I don't believe this!
I don't believe it!

45:32.229 --> 45:34.231
You're ragging on me for buying
the house in this neighborhood.

45:34.266 --> 45:36.834
I would think you would want
Brian to move in with me!

45:36.869 --> 45:39.236
Not if he's
the wrong person!

46:04.161 --> 46:07.164
Okay, everybody look alive.
We're coming up to the fermata.

46:07.199 --> 46:09.550
Here it comes.
Nobody move.

46:09.585 --> 46:11.844
Hold, hold,
hold, hold, hold.

46:11.879 --> 46:14.069
Now at the spring concert,

46:14.104 --> 46:16.507
the audience is going to be
dying for this next note,

46:16.542 --> 46:19.908
but we're gonna make 'em wait.

46:19.943 --> 46:23.212
And wait and wait
and wait and wait.

46:23.247 --> 46:26.049
You wait here. I'm gonna
go get a cup of coffee.

46:26.084 --> 46:28.350
- Roberta!
- Good-bye.

46:28.385 --> 46:31.186
Roberta!

46:31.221 --> 46:33.789
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right!

46:33.824 --> 46:37.494
But you gotta remember, you gotta
all come in together. Promise me.

46:47.271 --> 46:51.264
- Man, we'll never get that right.
- That's not a very nice thing to say about your classmates.

46:51.408 --> 46:55.401
How many people think we can
get it right by the concert?

47:01.819 --> 47:05.289
See?
I think we can. Have faith, DeSean.

47:05.324 --> 47:07.456
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

47:07.491 --> 47:11.061
<i>All right.
Practice makes perfect.</i>

47:11.096 --> 47:13.128
Can I go upstairs?

47:13.163 --> 47:16.565
Yeah, go see if you
can find your room.

47:16.600 --> 47:20.593
<i>- Careful, there's no railing... yet.
- All right.</i>

47:22.606 --> 47:25.140
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey.

47:25.175 --> 47:29.179
- How's it going?
- If I could just remember what I did here yesterday,

47:29.214 --> 47:31.814
I could be moving a whole lot faster.

47:31.849 --> 47:35.519
- You look real pretty today, honey.
- Thanks.

47:35.554 --> 47:37.953
Roberta, honey...

47:37.988 --> 47:40.355
have you lost your mind?

47:40.390 --> 47:44.226
<i>Wait, what is that?</i>

47:44.261 --> 47:48.254
- That's Sheetrock.
- Why does it have wallpaper all over it?

47:48.298 --> 47:52.291
- That's how it comes.
- Wait a minute. What do they call that?

47:52.669 --> 47:54.636
Sheetrock.

47:54.671 --> 47:58.442
- And why...
- That's the way it comes now.

48:00.611 --> 48:03.579
Roberta,
you've got to be kidding me.

48:03.614 --> 48:07.017
These ex-cons you've hired
ripped this off,

48:07.052 --> 48:08.984
just like
they're ripping you off.

48:09.019 --> 48:12.623
I have spent every single
penny of my settlement on this house.

48:12.658 --> 48:15.026
I don't have the bucks, okay,

48:15.061 --> 48:17.795
to hire fancy union workers.

48:17.830 --> 48:20.530
Okay, fine.
Do it your way.

48:20.565 --> 48:24.523
As usual.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.709
- Fight, fight!
- Oh, my God!

48:35.012 --> 48:37.179
- Okay, boys...
- Come on, kids. Break it up.

48:37.214 --> 48:40.284
- Calm down. What's wrong with you?
- Nick, come on!

48:40.319 --> 48:44.277
Hey.

48:53.530 --> 48:55.497
I'm putting him
on two-day suspension,

48:55.532 --> 48:58.702
- but next time he will be expelled.
- There will not be a "next time."

48:58.737 --> 49:01.003
I promise you that.

49:01.038 --> 49:03.538
Have you noticed
your son lately?

49:03.573 --> 49:06.310
He's tied up in knots,
and he's asking for help.

49:06.345 --> 49:10.303
Kids fight.
You're making too much of this.

49:16.219 --> 49:19.690
He was choking
the kid, Roberta.

49:19.725 --> 49:21.957
Nick is in trouble,

49:21.992 --> 49:25.985
and you need
to deal with it.

49:31.735 --> 49:35.728
Hey, Lexi, catch!

49:36.039 --> 49:38.974
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

49:39.009 --> 49:41.310
<i>- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry.</i>

49:41.345 --> 49:43.347
- Come here.
- I didn't mean it. The wind took it.

49:43.382 --> 49:45.981
- Come here.
- No, I don't have enough power!

49:46.016 --> 49:49.451
- No! Help me!
- You're gonna get it.

49:49.486 --> 49:53.479
- Are you a duck or a chicken?
- I'm a chicken!

49:54.057 --> 49:56.158
You're a chicken?

49:56.193 --> 49:58.195
- Careful!
- You got yourself a chicken.

49:58.230 --> 50:01.098
I'm a chicken!

50:08.138 --> 50:12.131
You're the only one
that can make Nick laugh nowadays.

50:12.676 --> 50:16.669
He just misses his dad.
I'm just a fill-in.

50:16.813 --> 50:20.806
No, I don't think so.
I think he really, really likes you.

50:22.686 --> 50:25.554
- Huh.
- We're all hopin'...

50:25.589 --> 50:29.426
you'll move into the new house
with us, you know.

50:29.461 --> 50:32.661
Whoa.
Slow down here a minute.

50:32.696 --> 50:35.699
- That's a little too much
like getting married.

50:35.734 --> 50:38.100
He's sweating.

50:38.135 --> 50:40.535
What's so bad
about that?

50:40.570 --> 50:43.440
How do you know that in five years
we'll even like each other?

50:43.475 --> 50:46.576
- Oh, well, you know, maybe we won't.
- Yeah.

50:46.611 --> 50:48.712
But if two people care
about each other,

50:48.747 --> 50:51.113
you know,
they take a chance.

50:51.148 --> 50:53.815
Yeah, like you and Charles
took a chance.

50:53.850 --> 50:57.843
I'm not talking about Charles,
I'm talking about us.

50:58.155 --> 51:01.423
Roberta, look, marriage...

51:01.458 --> 51:05.295
It's based on a belief that one person
can completely meet another's needs.

51:05.330 --> 51:07.562
Now, I just...
I don't buy that.

51:07.597 --> 51:09.733
- Whoa, wait, wait a minute.
- I never have.

51:09.768 --> 51:11.952
What are you saying?

51:11.987 --> 51:14.102
Are you saying that...

51:14.137 --> 51:16.638
if you have some needs
that I don't meet,

51:16.673 --> 51:19.776
you would go and have them
met by somebody else?

51:22.546 --> 51:26.539
I'm saying it's a fantasy to think
about marriage lasting these days.

51:27.818 --> 51:31.121
One out of two marriages
ends in misery and divorce.

51:31.156 --> 51:33.290
No, no, no, you're not
answering my question.

51:33.325 --> 51:35.657
What is your question?

51:35.692 --> 51:38.794
If I don't meet
all of your needs,

51:38.829 --> 51:40.796
you know, and we're
in a committed relationship...

51:40.831 --> 51:44.701
I'm not talking about marriage.
I'm just talking about a relationship.

51:44.736 --> 51:48.438
You would go
to somebody else?

51:48.473 --> 51:52.442
In theory... yes.

51:52.477 --> 51:54.409
"In theory"?

51:54.444 --> 51:56.446
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.

51:56.481 --> 51:58.713
Wh-What happened here?

51:58.748 --> 52:00.749
Weren't we having
a nice time?

52:00.784 --> 52:04.488
Yeah, okay. Have we been having
a great time together?

52:04.523 --> 52:07.089
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

52:07.124 --> 52:11.117
So let's just keep it
that way, all right?

52:12.863 --> 52:14.865
Or not.

52:18.135 --> 52:20.635
Let's go!
Come on!

52:20.670 --> 52:24.663
Let's go home!
We're all going home.

52:25.308 --> 52:29.301
<i>- Why can't he?
- Because he just can't.</i>

52:31.314 --> 52:33.433
Brian is at his house
tonight.

52:33.468 --> 52:35.517
We are at ours.

52:35.552 --> 52:38.155
- Then I want to go to his house.
- That's enough, Nick.

52:38.190 --> 52:40.122
Come on.

52:40.157 --> 52:43.727
Will you please just set up your violin
and start practicing while I make supper.

52:43.762 --> 52:46.196
Why don't you see if the puppy left
us a little present in the bathroom?

52:46.231 --> 52:48.530
I don't feel like practicing!

52:48.565 --> 52:52.558
I don't care.
Just go do it, now. Go. Go.

52:52.869 --> 52:55.203
I want to go to Brian's!

52:55.238 --> 52:57.806
<i>Stop whining...</i>

52:57.841 --> 53:01.834
and go practice
the violin.

53:04.247 --> 53:08.240
Get your violin.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.525
Man.

53:20.964 --> 53:24.957
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?

53:25.602 --> 53:27.704
The problem with you is
you're mean to everybody,

53:27.739 --> 53:30.872
and then they don't want
to be with you!

53:30.907 --> 53:34.242
I've had just
about enough of you, young man.

53:34.277 --> 53:38.270
You just set up that violin properly
and start practicing right...

53:38.415 --> 53:42.408
I hate the violin!

53:42.719 --> 53:44.786
Pick up that bow right now.

53:44.821 --> 53:48.256
Don't you ever, ever
throw down your bo...

53:48.291 --> 53:51.595
<i>It's all your fault!
You made Daddy leave us!</i>

53:51.630 --> 53:52.994
<i>Now you're gonna make
Brian leave us!</i>

53:53.029 --> 53:56.266
You're gonna be all alone,
and I'll have to take care of you!

53:56.301 --> 54:00.259
You don't have to...
take care of me.

54:01.471 --> 54:05.464
- Then who's going to?
- I can take care of myself.

54:06.710 --> 54:10.703
And I can take care of you
and Lexi. I promise.

54:11.982 --> 54:15.402
You didn't try hard enough.

54:15.437 --> 54:18.822
You made Daddy leave us.

54:18.857 --> 54:22.815
That isn't true.

54:23.393 --> 54:27.386
And that is not fair.

54:27.697 --> 54:31.690
I begged him not to leave us,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

54:32.302 --> 54:36.273
- Why not?
- Because he found somebody else...

54:36.308 --> 54:39.909
that he likes more...
than me.

54:39.944 --> 54:43.478
Who?

54:43.513 --> 54:46.748
Lana.

54:46.783 --> 54:50.776
Remember Lana and Tom,
our friends in Greece?

54:51.855 --> 54:53.923
That's her.

54:59.429 --> 55:03.422
Is he gonna marry her now?

55:09.005 --> 55:12.998
No, honey.

55:13.076 --> 55:17.069
<i>But he's not...</i>

55:19.115 --> 55:23.108
He's not ever coming back...
to me.

55:26.823 --> 55:30.392
Come here, Lex.
Come here, baby.

55:30.427 --> 55:33.880
I'm... I'm gonna
take care of you, Nick.

55:33.915 --> 55:36.942
And I'm gonna take care
of your brother.

55:36.977 --> 55:39.969
And we're still a family.
Come here, baby.

55:40.004 --> 55:43.268
I'm never gonna go anywhere.

55:43.303 --> 55:46.532
Okay?
You don't have to worry.

55:53.450 --> 55:56.453
Hey. Hey!

56:31.554 --> 56:34.089
<i>- Hey.
- What?</i>

56:34.124 --> 56:37.092
- What color is that?
- White.

56:37.127 --> 56:41.120
- No, I told you eggshell.
- Eggshells are white.

56:41.931 --> 56:45.924
Women.

56:45.969 --> 56:49.003
<i>Roberta...</i>

56:49.038 --> 56:51.005
how many times
I tell you...

56:51.040 --> 56:53.576
you can't be
your own contractor?

56:53.611 --> 56:55.543
You're an idiot.

56:55.578 --> 56:59.571
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I am an idiot.

57:00.984 --> 57:03.118
<i>Hey! Ernie!</i>

57:03.153 --> 57:05.939
Ernie, wake up. Come on, come on.

57:05.974 --> 57:08.725
I'm sorry,
but you are fired.

57:08.760 --> 57:11.612
You're fired.
Yeah. Go.

57:11.647 --> 57:14.429
You two...
You're fired.

57:14.464 --> 57:17.031
- Out. Get out.
- Is she kidding?

57:17.066 --> 57:21.059
<i>- You're kidding, right?
- I want you out of my house! Go!</i>

57:24.040 --> 57:26.976
You're fired too.

57:27.011 --> 57:30.747
Take it! Go!

57:30.782 --> 57:33.148
Yeah.

57:33.183 --> 57:37.176
- Yeah, that's more like it.
- You're fired too.

57:38.188 --> 57:40.455
What?

57:40.490 --> 57:43.059
I mean it.
I mean... I mean it.

57:43.094 --> 57:45.429
I need to be with a man,
you know,

57:45.464 --> 57:48.610
who can make
a commitment to me.

57:48.645 --> 57:51.757
I need that,
and my boys need that.

57:53.903 --> 57:57.896
Can you do that?

58:02.045 --> 58:05.576
Roberta...

58:05.611 --> 58:09.107
Get out!

58:12.856 --> 58:14.958
All right.

58:16.960 --> 58:20.530
All right.

59:28.331 --> 59:31.901
Whew! That was great.

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:24.186
<i>All right!</i>

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:27.690
Bravo!

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:35.087
<i>All right!</i>

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:44.262
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:06.427
<i>Children, today
is a very special day...</i>

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:10.455
<i>because we're starting the tenth year
of the East Harlem Violin Program.</i>

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:15.661
Now, some of you might know that I used
to teach just 50 kids at this school.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.207
But now I teach
150 kids...

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.143
<i>at three different
East Harlem schools.</i>

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:26.171
So many children want to take this violin
class that we have to have a lottery.

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:29.684
<i>Now this is a wonderful opportunity,</i>

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:33.712
so I want you to talk to your parents about
whether or not you would like to try this.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:38.050
My daughter took violin with Roberta
when she was your age.

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:42.721
Now she's in high school, and she
still talks about how much she loved it.

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:46.868
Janet and I
started this program...

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:50.896
because we knew how much you kids
could benefit from it.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:55.901
<i>You should know, however,
the violin...</i>

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.281
is a difficult instrument.

01:01:58.316 --> 01:02:00.448
So I...
What is it, Justin?

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:03.269
<i>- Who's that lady in the back?
- Oh, excuse me.</i>

01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:06.020
Yes, this is
Dorothea Von Hauften, and she...

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.289
<i>- What kind of name is that?
- Justin, shh.</i>

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:11.143
<i>She's taking pictures
of Roberta's classes...</i>

01:02:11.178 --> 01:02:13.928
for a magazine article
on music education.

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:16.499
<i>- I want to be in a magazine.
- First things first, Justin.</i>

01:02:16.534 --> 01:02:19.067
Roberta's going to explain to us
about the lottery.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:22.171
What we're gonna do is, you're going
to bring in your permission slips.

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:24.691
<i>Have your parents sign them.
You bring them in.</i>

01:02:24.726 --> 01:02:27.947
I'm gonna take a hat.
I'm gonna close my eyes...

01:02:27.982 --> 01:02:31.169
and I'm gonna pick just 50 names
from each school...

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:34.016
'cause there isn't enough room
for everybody else.

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:38.009
<i>So, on Friday,
bring in the slips,</i>

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:41.022
<i>and we will tell you
who gets to be...</i>

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:45.038
<i>- in the violin class.
Yeah, but everybody gets a chance.</i>

01:02:45.073 --> 01:02:49.020
- Yes?
- I really, really hope that I get in the class.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:53.169
<i>I really hope you do too.</i>

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:29.361
Wait, Lex, what time is it?
- 2:20.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:33.899
<i>- I got to go.
- Nick, Lexi, how come you guys don't play the violin?</i>

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:38.548
We used to, but you know
how my mom is as a teacher?

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.186
Picture her being your teacher
and your mother.

01:03:43.221 --> 01:03:45.787
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry I'm so late.
- Hi, Mom.</i>

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.558
<i>- Hi, Rachel. - Hi. -
Hey, Allegra, come here.</i>

01:03:48.593 --> 01:03:50.458
Nick, are you
finished practicing?

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.593
<i>- Yeah, I'm done.
- Already?</i>

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:55.965
<i>- You hardly even practiced.
- What, are you timing me with a stopwatch?</i>

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.866
- Why don't you pick on Lexi for a change?
- 'Cause I'm perfect.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:01.971
<i>- 'Cause he's perfect.
Yeah, but your head hurts, right?</i>

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:04.972
- Have a good lesson, Rachel.
- Thanks.

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:08.911
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to meet Lawrence, play some basketball.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:11.347
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Okay.

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:30.222
Don't forget the vibrato.

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:34.101
Dang,
I just can't get that right.

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:36.138
Well, that's almost it.
You almost got it.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:38.306
Almost isn't good enough.

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:42.334
Ooh, did I turn you
into such a perfectionist?

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:46.214
No, I came that way.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.216
That's what I thought.

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:52.244
Well, just as long as you get it...
for your Juilliard audition.

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:56.023
What?

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:59.095
I've recommended you
for a gifted kids scholarship.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:01.062
Really?

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:04.216
I think you can do it.

01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:06.978
And the next is...

01:05:07.013 --> 01:05:09.670
Shandra Wilson.

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:13.474
<i>- Yes!
- Congratulations.</i>

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:17.513
- All right, Shandra! Good for you.
- Congratulations, sweetie.

01:05:17.548 --> 01:05:21.506
- All right. Next is Justin Brady.
- Yes!

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:25.219
Yeah.

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.321
- Yes!
- Here you go.

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:30.359
- Next one is... Could be you.
- Look at this, Ramon.

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:34.352
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Vanessa Klein.</i>

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:39.491
Vanessa, good for you, honey.
Wow, such a good class.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.602
<i>And the very last one, okay?</i>

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:45.630
And that is Ramon Olivas.

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:50.168
All right, Ramon.
Good for you. Oh, my gosh.

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:06.138
<i>- Thank you!
- Yea!</i>

01:06:06.173 --> 01:06:08.572
<i>I got it!</i>

01:06:08.607 --> 01:06:12.600
I got it!

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.363
Does that really work,
the ticket thing?

01:06:31.398 --> 01:06:33.330
- Oh. Oh, hello.
- Hello.

01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:36.600
No, that doesn't work,
but I keep trying.

01:06:36.635 --> 01:06:39.571
You know, maybe one day, the school
will give me a parking space.

01:06:39.606 --> 01:06:42.603
- Oh.
- That would be nice.

01:06:42.638 --> 01:06:45.600
- Here. Photographs.
- Oh!

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:51.038
Oh, no!
They're fantastic!

01:06:52.517 --> 01:06:55.603
<i>Those copies are for you.
- Oh, thank you so much!</i>

01:06:55.638 --> 01:06:58.655
Oh, they're great!
Oh, can I pay you for them?

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.860
Oh, don't be silly. You'll need
your money for parking tickets.

01:07:01.895 --> 01:07:05.495
Oh, thank you so much!
That's fantastic!

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:08.699
I think what you're doing
for these children... It's wonderful.

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:12.727
My husband's a violinist. He was very
impressed when I told him about you.

01:07:12.804 --> 01:07:16.797
- Oh, really? What's his name?
- Arnold Steinhardt.

01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:21.569
- Of the Guarneri String Quartet?
- Yeah. Oh, here.

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:25.550
Stay in touch. Let us know
when the kids have a concert.

01:07:25.585 --> 01:07:27.851
I will, I will.
Oh, thank you.

01:07:27.886 --> 01:07:30.355
Thank you so much.
That's really...

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.824
<i>- Here.
- That's... Oh, gosh.</i>

01:07:32.859 --> 01:07:36.260
- Keys. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:07:36.295 --> 01:07:39.529
Very good! Okay, now when you
take your violins home,

01:07:39.564 --> 01:07:43.557
I'm gonna ask you to put your music... Tape it
up on the wall directly in front of your nose.

01:07:45.337 --> 01:07:49.319
'Cause you don't want to be bending over
like this, trying to read your music.

01:07:49.354 --> 01:07:53.301
<i>- Your parents are gonna be so excited to see you... play.
- Stop!</i>

01:07:56.848 --> 01:08:00.018
Yeah, okay.
Let's try it again.

01:08:00.053 --> 01:08:03.455
<i>Ready?
And...</i>

01:08:06.558 --> 01:08:10.551
Ramon, how many cats
you killing back there?

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:28.703
Ready and...

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:34.642
Myesha, your stop sign
should be touching, honey.

01:08:35.354 --> 01:08:38.622
<i>Don't let it wiggle around
like that.</i>

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:42.459
<i>Justin, you're on the wrong string.</i>

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.162
<i>Look at your feet.
All right, hold it, hold it, hold it.</i>

01:08:45.198 --> 01:08:47.064
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What time...

01:08:47.099 --> 01:08:51.091
- Vanessa, where is your violin?
- I forgot it.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:54.438
Again?

01:08:54.473 --> 01:08:56.725
This is...
Good-bye.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.942
<i>Go on. Good-bye.</i>

01:08:58.977 --> 01:09:01.546
I'm sorry, but, you know,
you may be dropped.

01:09:01.581 --> 01:09:04.481
<i>Go!</i>

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:08.151
Hey, Ramon, that's very much better.
I have to tell you, I'm very impressed.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:12.179
<i>- That practicing is paying off.
Let me see your nails, Rosario.</i>

01:09:12.624 --> 01:09:16.617
See? You gotta keep these clipped.
And I'm looking at you too, Myesha.

01:09:16.828 --> 01:09:19.197
- Everybody, I've told you...
- Drop dead, Justin!

01:09:19.232 --> 01:09:21.798
- It was an accident.
- It was not!

01:09:21.832 --> 01:09:24.836
Hey, Ramon, I don't like that kind of
talk in here! You pick that stand up now.

01:09:24.871 --> 01:09:26.737
You get the music.
Come on.

01:09:26.772 --> 01:09:30.765
Listen to me, buddy. We have a big concert
coming up. You're not gonna be in it maybe.

01:09:32.511 --> 01:09:36.504
<i>- Is that what you want?
- No.</i>

01:09:36.747 --> 01:09:40.741
<i>- Ooh.
- Nothing funny here.</i>

01:09:41.653 --> 01:09:44.421
<i>- Here you go, sweetheart.
Come on, I got it.</i>

01:09:44.456 --> 01:09:46.523
<i>- Good night. - Bye-bye.
Work hard. - Get inside.</i>

01:09:46.558 --> 01:09:48.859
That a girl. We just got...
We're in a hurry, that's all.

01:09:48.895 --> 01:09:50.827
- Mr. Klein?
- Yeah?

01:09:50.862 --> 01:09:54.855
You know, I'm gonna have to drop Vanessa
from class if she keeps forgetting her violin.

01:09:56.968 --> 01:09:59.069
Hey, look...

01:09:59.104 --> 01:10:02.641
she's going back and forth
between houses.

01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:06.634
My wife and I split up.

01:10:06.845 --> 01:10:09.713
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:12.751
Vanessa, why don't you write down
for your mom and dad...

01:10:12.786 --> 01:10:16.744
<i>which days are violin days,
okay?</i>

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:28.665
Relax your two, Simon.
Good.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:32.693
Kenny, your stop sign should be up.
Up, up, up, up. That's better.

01:10:33.205 --> 01:10:37.198
<i>Stephanie, you look like you never had a
violin lesson with me in your entire life!</i>

01:10:39.511 --> 01:10:41.478
Oh, Carlos.
Where's your violin?

01:10:41.513 --> 01:10:44.983
- Um... it's coming.
- What's it, walking here by itself?

01:10:45.018 --> 01:10:48.518
<i>- I'm coming!
- Thank you.</i>

01:10:48.553 --> 01:10:52.489
- Your buddies giving you a hard time?
- Look, it's just not cool.

01:10:52.524 --> 01:10:55.543
<i>- You wouldn't understand.
- You want your sister to carry your violin, that's fine.</i>

01:10:55.578 --> 01:10:58.563
But is she practicing for you too? Because
that's the way it sounds to me lately.

01:10:58.598 --> 01:11:00.530
- I've been busy.
- I don't want to hear it.

01:11:00.565 --> 01:11:02.601
Get here on time and commit to
this class or I don't want you in here.

01:11:02.636 --> 01:11:04.803
<i>You understand me?
Go.</i>

01:11:04.838 --> 01:11:08.796
<i>Go.</i>

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.981
You're a good violinist,
Carlos,

01:11:18.016 --> 01:11:21.152
but it is definitely not cool
to waste your talent.

01:11:21.187 --> 01:11:24.087
<i>- Okay?
- Yeah.</i>

01:11:24.122 --> 01:11:27.993
<i>So, let's do it again.
Perfect this time.</i>

01:11:30.228 --> 01:11:34.221
Hi.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:39.693
Hey...

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:49.803
What happened?

01:11:54.986 --> 01:11:58.979
- I guess you've all heard the bad news about Justin.
- I didn't hear.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:03.789
<i>There was a drive-by
shooting by his house,</i>

01:12:03.824 --> 01:12:07.221
and he got shot by accident
and he died.

01:12:14.139 --> 01:12:18.132
Would anybody like
to talk about this now?

01:12:29.788 --> 01:12:31.755
Ramon?

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:35.783
I think we should
just play violin.

01:13:00.318 --> 01:13:04.311
- Roberta, come in.
- I just wanted to stop by and check on Ramon.

01:13:05.690 --> 01:13:09.683
- Why?
- Didn't he tell you what happened at school today?

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:27.434
- Hey, Roberta wants to talk to you, okay?
- Okay.

01:13:42.327 --> 01:13:45.230
- Did that sound okay?
- That sounded very good.

01:13:45.265 --> 01:13:49.223
Very good.

01:13:52.237 --> 01:13:54.239
I've been thinking
about Justin.

01:13:56.241 --> 01:13:59.978
Remember how mad I was
at him the last time I saw him?

01:14:00.013 --> 01:14:03.446
Yeah. You got
really strict with him.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:07.474
Yeah, but, you know, it wasn't
always easy to be nice to him.

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:12.312
You think Justin’s
in heaven or hell?

01:14:13.124 --> 01:14:17.117
Heaven.

01:14:18.196 --> 01:14:20.230
I told him to drop dead.

01:14:20.265 --> 01:14:24.258
Well, Justin didn't die
because you said that.

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:28.304
<i>- I promise.
- How would you know?</i>

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:32.332
Well, I don't think
you're that powerful. You know?

01:14:34.079 --> 01:14:36.246
<i>If you had such powers,</i>

01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:39.818
<i>just imagine what kind of
a violinist you'd be by now.</i>

01:14:39.853 --> 01:14:43.811
Yeah, I'd be better than you.

01:14:51.129 --> 01:14:53.815
It's okay to cry.

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:56.610
Not for a man.

01:14:56.645 --> 01:14:59.335
My boys still cry,

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:03.363
and they're big, strong
young men now.

01:15:03.508 --> 01:15:06.377
And I'll bet Justin’s
daddy cried.

01:15:15.754 --> 01:15:19.747
It's okay.

01:15:30.135 --> 01:15:32.470
What's this?

01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:40.534
Oh. What is all this?

01:15:49.854 --> 01:15:52.791
What is this?

01:15:58.229 --> 01:16:02.222
I...

01:16:02.834 --> 01:16:06.827
Nick! Lexi!
You come down here right now!

01:16:09.107 --> 01:16:13.100
<i>Mom, we were just trying to help.</i>

01:16:13.144 --> 01:16:15.845
This is so humiliating.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.181
No one even knows
it's you.

01:16:18.216 --> 01:16:20.919
I mean, you don't even have to
read them, if you don't want to.

01:16:20.954 --> 01:16:23.419
Although, look, obviously,

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.855
a lot of guys are interested
in dating you.

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:29.883
No, a lot of guys are interested
in dating you and Lexi.

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:34.833
What did you say
about me anyway?

01:16:34.868 --> 01:16:37.867
Beautiful musician,

01:16:37.902 --> 01:16:40.136
late thirties,
tired of playing solo...

01:16:40.171 --> 01:16:44.164
Seeks a healthy, stable, attractive man
who's not afraid of a duet...

01:16:44.442 --> 01:16:46.910
<i>with a strong, independent woman.</i>

01:16:46.945 --> 01:16:49.212
My violin playing
will feed your soul.

01:16:49.247 --> 01:16:51.349
<i>And my lasagna will be music
to your palette.</i>

01:16:51.384 --> 01:16:53.316
Oh, my God!

01:16:53.351 --> 01:16:56.352
Did you catch
all the music metaphors?

01:16:56.387 --> 01:16:59.924
Oh, no. Listen, don't you think
it's a little weird...

01:16:59.959 --> 01:17:02.094
that you're trying
to get your mother a date?

01:17:02.129 --> 01:17:04.194
And don't hit him again
or I'll smack you.

01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:07.198
Don't you think it's a little weird that
you're not even interested in dating?

01:17:07.233 --> 01:17:11.102
Look, even if I were
interested in dating,

01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:14.070
which... which I'm not,

01:17:14.105 --> 01:17:17.408
I don't have time to do that,
and, besides, you know,

01:17:17.443 --> 01:17:21.401
<i>I have my teaching...
which I love.</i>

01:17:21.579 --> 01:17:25.572
I have you...
and you.

01:17:26.417 --> 01:17:30.410
That's all I need.

01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:35.349
<i>- I really thought she'd
like the music metaphors.</i>

01:17:35.493 --> 01:17:39.486
She said don't hit me.

01:17:43.501 --> 01:17:47.494
God.

01:17:55.013 --> 01:17:59.006
"Dan Paxton."

01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:07.425
That's good.
That's good.

01:18:10.962 --> 01:18:12.362
<i>You're flat, Nick.</i>

01:18:12.397 --> 01:18:15.098
- I'm not flat, Mom.
- Sounds flat to me.

01:18:15.133 --> 01:18:19.126
Play the violin.
I'll take care of the cello, okay?

01:18:23.141 --> 01:18:25.376
So, you nervous, Mom?

01:18:25.411 --> 01:18:29.369
No.

01:18:36.554 --> 01:18:40.547
I'm... I'm just...
I'll be right back. I just...

01:18:41.192 --> 01:18:45.185
Let him in.

01:18:50.301 --> 01:18:54.294
Hi. I'm Dan Paxton.

01:18:54.472 --> 01:18:56.439
- Is this the right place?
- Yeah.

01:18:56.474 --> 01:18:58.474
- Roberta, right?
- Yeah. I'm her son, Lexi.

01:18:58.509 --> 01:19:02.502
- Oh, hi, Lexi. Nice to meet you.
- You can go in the living room.

01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:08.551
- Hi.
- Nick.

01:19:08.586 --> 01:19:11.672
- Uh, Dan.
- Dan, nice to meet you.

01:19:11.707 --> 01:19:14.724
- This is Allegra and...
- Hi. Oh, hey.

01:19:14.759 --> 01:19:18.752
She should be...
She should be out in a minute.

01:19:19.097 --> 01:19:23.090
<i>Hi.</i>

01:19:25.203 --> 01:19:27.537
- Dan?
- Yeah.

01:19:27.572 --> 01:19:30.641
- Hi, I'm Roberta.
- Wow. An honest woman.

01:19:30.676 --> 01:19:33.076
- "Honest"?
- Your ad.

01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:37.104
You said you were a beautiful woman,
and you were telling the truth.

01:19:38.049 --> 01:19:42.042
Oh.

01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:46.480
- We should probably take off... soon.
- Okay, all right.

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:50.817
I'll get my bag.

01:19:52.230 --> 01:19:56.223
Make sure you're home
by midnight, young lady.

01:19:57.769 --> 01:20:01.671
- He's like six four.
- I know.

01:20:01.706 --> 01:20:04.308
<i>To the right. To the right.</i>

01:20:07.045 --> 01:20:09.479
<i>That's the car. They're here.</i>

01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:12.083
<i>- All right.
- Oh, Mommy's late.</i>

01:20:12.118 --> 01:20:14.617
- What time is it anyway?
- 12:30.

01:20:14.652 --> 01:20:17.120
<i>- That's promising.
- Ten bucks says he tries to kiss her.</i>

01:20:17.155 --> 01:20:20.525
That's a no-brainer. Of course, he'll try.
The real question is whether she lets him.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.528
- Okay, ten bucks she lets him.
- You're on.

01:20:23.563 --> 01:20:26.197
Well, I had a good time
tonight.

01:20:26.232 --> 01:20:30.190
Yeah, I did too.
I, uh...

01:20:31.169 --> 01:20:33.171
I have a confession
to make though.

01:20:33.206 --> 01:20:35.671
Uh...

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:37.840
Uh, I've...

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.545
I've never answered
an ad before.

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:44.538
Uh, I lost a poker bet.

01:20:44.615 --> 01:20:48.608
No.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:52.188
But I'm glad I did.
But I...

01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:55.458
I have a little confession
myself.

01:20:55.493 --> 01:20:59.486
My boys placed the ad behind my back.

01:21:00.798 --> 01:21:03.199
<i>- You're kidding.
- No.</i>

01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:05.201
<i>- I had a great time.
- No. Really?</i>

01:21:05.236 --> 01:21:08.706
Yeah, they did this.
They're so worried I have no...

01:21:08.741 --> 01:21:11.441
social life.

01:21:11.476 --> 01:21:14.479
- Ten dollars.
- No way, man. She ain't gonna kiss him.

01:21:14.514 --> 01:21:18.472
- Just watch.
- Shut up.

01:21:24.822 --> 01:21:27.457
Dan, I just...
I want to tell...

01:21:27.492 --> 01:21:31.485
I went along with this because
it's been a while for me.

01:21:32.563 --> 01:21:34.849
<i>It's been quite a while.</i>

01:21:34.884 --> 01:21:37.100
But, um, I'm not sure...

01:21:37.135 --> 01:21:40.738
I really want to get involved
with anybody just yet.

01:21:40.773 --> 01:21:44.275
Does this mean
I don't get any lasagna?

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:47.529
Oh, yeah.

01:21:47.564 --> 01:21:50.713
<i>Bye.</i>

01:21:50.748 --> 01:21:52.715
Oh, my God!

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:56.554
- Jesus, what are you guys doing up?
- Sorry.

01:21:56.589 --> 01:21:58.521
Why, is it late?

01:21:58.556 --> 01:22:02.527
- How was it, Mom?
- It was nice, you know.

01:22:02.562 --> 01:22:04.494
- "Nice"?
- Yeah.

01:22:04.529 --> 01:22:06.597
What, as in like
"Let's just be friends" nice?

01:22:06.632 --> 01:22:09.734
Well, you know,
I don't know.

01:22:09.769 --> 01:22:12.802
But we'll see.

01:22:12.837 --> 01:22:15.606
- You know, there's a lot more letters.
- Good night, Nick.

01:22:15.641 --> 01:22:17.608
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, baby.

01:22:17.643 --> 01:22:19.742
Good night, Mom.

01:22:19.777 --> 01:22:21.744
That's right.
Pay up.

01:22:21.779 --> 01:22:25.772
Mom, could you
loan me ten dollars?

01:22:34.959 --> 01:22:38.690
Hi. Kids, I'm sorry I'm late.

01:22:38.725 --> 01:22:42.422
I got stuck over at C.P.E. 2.

01:22:42.733 --> 01:22:46.726
Where are your violins?

01:22:54.245 --> 01:22:57.715
- What's the matter?
- We heard you got fired.

01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:01.708
You what?

01:23:03.454 --> 01:23:07.447
<i>They don't want music anymore.</i>

01:23:14.332 --> 01:23:16.299
Is it true?

01:23:16.334 --> 01:23:19.470
- Come into the office, Roberta.
- It's true? You're firing me?

01:23:19.505 --> 01:23:22.440
It wasn't me, Roberta.
The Board of Ed cut the budget.

01:23:22.475 --> 01:23:24.640
The district had to comply.

01:23:24.675 --> 01:23:28.412
As of the end of this term,
the violin program has been excessed.

01:23:28.447 --> 01:23:30.446
"Excessed"?

01:23:30.481 --> 01:23:33.449
They specifically said
that my violin program has to go?

01:23:33.484 --> 01:23:36.520
They slashed the budget! Music and
art programs got hit the worst.

01:23:36.555 --> 01:23:39.557
- Yeah, what about Dennis's classes?
- Uh, I'm tenured, Roberta.

01:23:39.592 --> 01:23:41.457
Yeah. When was this
decided anyway?

01:23:41.492 --> 01:23:44.712
Things happened very quickly.
I wanted to tell you myself.

01:23:44.747 --> 01:23:47.897
- I can't believe this is happening!
- Why not? You are a sub.

01:23:47.932 --> 01:23:51.901
<i>- Your position has never been permanent.
- Hey, Dennis, just smile!</i>

01:23:51.936 --> 01:23:54.472
- This is the happiest day of your life, isn't it?
- Come into the office.

01:23:54.507 --> 01:23:58.488
You are not helping.

01:23:58.523 --> 01:24:02.469
Come on.

01:24:03.347 --> 01:24:06.651
- There must be some way that we can fight this.
- Fight it with what?

01:24:06.686 --> 01:24:10.321
I don't have any other extra programs
I can give them instead.

01:24:10.356 --> 01:24:13.656
I see. I see.

01:24:13.691 --> 01:24:17.295
After ten years, after 1,400 kids
have learned the violin,

01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:19.214
this is just
an "extra program."

01:24:19.249 --> 01:24:21.063
You know I don't
feel that way,

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.934
<i>and you know damn well I've been
standing by you all these years!</i>

01:24:23.969 --> 01:24:26.302
You think I haven't noticed
what you've done for these kids?

01:24:26.337 --> 01:24:29.106
- Then do something!
- I have been on this phone for the past three days...

01:24:29.141 --> 01:24:31.440
<i>trying to do something!</i>

01:24:31.475 --> 01:24:34.377
They're sick of hearing my voice!
Believe me...

01:24:34.412 --> 01:24:37.480
there are other people around here
I would much rather get rid of,

01:24:37.515 --> 01:24:41.508
but as far as the board is concerned,
violin classes are not a priority!

01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:47.414
I don't have
the power here, Roberta.

01:24:48.826 --> 01:24:52.129
I am so sorry.

01:26:37.134 --> 01:26:41.127
<i>Please sit.</i>

01:26:43.674 --> 01:26:47.667
This beautiful concert
that you just heard...

01:26:48.679 --> 01:26:50.880
could be
the very last concert...

01:26:50.915 --> 01:26:54.049
<i>of the East Harlem Violin Program.</i>

01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:58.077
<i>The Board of Ed and the district
superintendent think that music...</i>

01:26:58.689 --> 01:27:02.057
isn't important
for our kids.

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:05.895
<i>But they are wrong,</i>

01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:09.567
<i>and they're gonna get a big fight.</i>

01:27:32.089 --> 01:27:34.190
<i>Why do the parents have to meet here?</i>

01:27:34.225 --> 01:27:37.094
<i>- You should be using the vacuum
cleaner, by the way. I got it.</i>

01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:41.087
<i>Oh, God, somebody's early.</i>

01:27:41.699 --> 01:27:45.692
- Hello, Assunta. How are you?
- Well, I'd be a lot better...

01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:49.607
- if my daughter had a job next year.
- Well, so would I.

01:27:49.642 --> 01:27:52.074
- Ma.
Sorry I'm early, but, um...

01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:55.579
I figured we'd need
a little extra time to set up.

01:27:55.614 --> 01:27:59.114
Beware of Greeks
bearing you-know-what.

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:01.851
Mommy, will you mind taking Allegra
for a walk right now please?

01:28:01.886 --> 01:28:04.955
<i>- You are having a meeting here tonight, right?
Parents and teachers?  - Yes.</i>

01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:07.157
<i>- Get down, get down.
Come on, Allegra. Let's go.</i>

01:28:07.192 --> 01:28:10.259
<i>- Take it from me,
- Good-bye.</i>

01:28:10.294 --> 01:28:12.563
If you want to get parents to help you
with something, you got to feed them.

01:28:12.598 --> 01:28:15.264
<i>Do you have a cutting board for these?</i>

01:28:15.299 --> 01:28:19.292
And if you think
parents are bad, teachers are worse.

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:21.772
Believe me, I know.
I was a teacher.

01:28:21.807 --> 01:28:24.573
That's why I brought snacks.

01:28:24.608 --> 01:28:27.877
- Wow.
- Gets them every time.

01:28:27.912 --> 01:28:31.280
Uh, you didn't expect me
to bring homemade, did you?

01:28:31.315 --> 01:28:35.308
- No, I didn't...
- Good, because my husband begs me to stay out of the kitchen.

01:28:39.723 --> 01:28:43.716
- I didn't expect you to be here at all.
- Why not?

01:28:44.962 --> 01:28:47.965
We got to figure out a way
to fight this.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.132
And after ten years,
I don't know,

01:28:50.167 --> 01:28:53.571
I just can't imagine walking down
those hallways and not hearing that...

01:28:53.606 --> 01:28:56.307
off-key, nails-on-blackboard
violin music.

01:28:58.943 --> 01:29:02.936
Thank you.

01:29:03.347 --> 01:29:07.340
- Ma. Ma, get some...
- I'll tell you this.

01:29:08.586 --> 01:29:10.553
If this was
a downtown problem,

01:29:10.588 --> 01:29:12.389
they would take care of it tomorrow.

01:29:12.424 --> 01:29:15.124
Absolutely right.

01:29:15.159 --> 01:29:17.061
They don't realize how much
this program helps our kids.

01:29:17.096 --> 01:29:19.948
Simon is our third child
to study with Roberta.

01:29:19.983 --> 01:29:22.765
<i>James is premed.
April is valedictorian.</i>

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.801
<i>- Now that says something.
- Nobody knows that.</i>

01:29:25.836 --> 01:29:28.922
<i>We should inundate the board and the
district with letters. I mean, flood them.</i>

01:29:28.957 --> 01:29:32.009
It doesn't matter how many letters you
send them. It's just not in the budget.

01:29:32.044 --> 01:29:34.778
- What if we raise the money ourselves?
- Oh, they wouldn't object.

01:29:34.813 --> 01:29:37.179
What if you did a benefit concert?

01:29:37.214 --> 01:29:41.150
<i>We could raise a batch of money
from the ticket sales,</i>

01:29:41.185 --> 01:29:44.887
and the concert itself could
be great publicity for the program.

01:29:44.922 --> 01:29:48.915
It can't just be me and the kids, I don't
think, not if you're gonna charge money.

01:29:48.993 --> 01:29:51.393
Perhaps I could persuade Arnold
to play with you and the kids.

01:29:51.428 --> 01:29:55.421
<i>- And, well, maybe he can get
another violinist too.</i>

01:29:56.033 --> 01:29:58.000
Itzhak Perlman, perhaps.

01:29:58.035 --> 01:30:01.005
Itzhak Perlman?
Arnold and... Arnold would do this?

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.005
Itzhak Perlman?

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.074
And Arnold... Would they
do this, though?

01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:07.142
<i>Yes, Arnold and Itzhak
are very good friends.</i>

01:30:07.177 --> 01:30:09.144
<i>Seriously, you think they would?
- Yes, yes.</i>

01:30:09.179 --> 01:30:13.172
And we could rent a place like the
92nd Street "Y." It's perfect for this.

01:30:13.717 --> 01:30:17.454
- It seats about 900 people.
- Nine hundred would be more than enough.

01:30:17.489 --> 01:30:21.123
And if we charge between
$50 and $100 a ticket, then...

01:30:21.158 --> 01:30:23.493
That could raise you enough
to reinstate your program for a year.

01:30:23.528 --> 01:30:25.794
<i>That's a very... That's a great idea.</i>

01:30:25.829 --> 01:30:28.397
- That's a lot of money, Roberta.
- It'll be fun.

01:30:28.432 --> 01:30:31.367
<i>If you can get us the fellows.</i>

01:30:31.402 --> 01:30:35.395
Beg him. Do whatever
you need to do.

01:30:35.973 --> 01:30:39.966
- Hi.
- Well, I have some good news and some great news.

01:30:40.978 --> 01:30:43.447
We're in five different papers.

01:30:45.883 --> 01:30:49.876
Oh, my... Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:31:07.237 --> 01:31:10.172
Itzhak, it's Arnold.

01:31:10.207 --> 01:31:12.141
You know,
the other fiddler.

01:31:12.176 --> 01:31:15.913
I have something
to propose to you.

01:31:17.915 --> 01:31:21.179
<i>Let's break all the rules</i>

01:31:21.214 --> 01:31:24.444
<i>Come on, baby
Me and you</i>

01:31:26.724 --> 01:31:30.717
- Thank you.
- Okay, good luck.

01:31:35.332 --> 01:31:38.546
<i>Let's break all the rules</i>

01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:41.761
<i>Come on, baby
Me and you</i>

01:31:58.188 --> 01:32:00.889
Hey!

01:32:00.924 --> 01:32:04.917
Everybody, listen to me.
Pay attention. Fall in.

01:32:05.129 --> 01:32:08.363
<i>You people
are my very best...</i>

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:11.333
beginning and advanced
violin students,

01:32:11.368 --> 01:32:15.105
and that's why you have been chosen
to be in the Fiddlefest.

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:19.098
Because I trust that
you can handle this pressure.

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:22.746
This is gonna be a lot of work,
a lot, a lot of work!

01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:25.547
<i>People have already
bought tickets to this thing,</i>

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:28.018
<i>and we are not gonna be here
in the fall if, you know,</i>

01:32:28.053 --> 01:32:30.020
<i>they all run screaming
to the box office...</i>

01:32:30.055 --> 01:32:32.189
and want their money back,
okay?

01:32:32.224 --> 01:32:34.156
So you gotta be good!

01:32:34.191 --> 01:32:36.859
<i>- "Bach's Minuet 1"?
- Yes, that's right.</i>

01:32:36.894 --> 01:32:39.296
Because people are gonna be
paying good money for this concert.

01:32:39.331 --> 01:32:41.296
They don't want
to hear "Twinkle."

01:32:41.331 --> 01:32:45.324
Okay. Now, on the second page of
your music, you will see a contract.

01:32:46.436 --> 01:32:50.239
<i>I need you and I need your parents
to sign that...</i>

01:32:50.274 --> 01:32:54.267
because that promises me you are gonna
be there at each and every rehearsal.

01:32:54.411 --> 01:32:58.180
- Every Saturday and Sunday?
- Every Saturday and Sunday...

01:32:58.215 --> 01:33:01.351
<i>- and nighttime rehearsals
during the week.</i>

01:33:01.386 --> 01:33:03.921
Oh, yes!
We have six weeks, people!

01:33:03.956 --> 01:33:06.421
Six weeks to this concert.
All right?

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:09.124
That's not enough time.
We can't do it all in school.

01:33:09.159 --> 01:33:12.462
I'm thinking, maybe, we're gonna come
in early before school in the mornings.

01:33:12.497 --> 01:33:16.064
<i>Come in early...</i>

01:33:16.099 --> 01:33:19.536
No, that's what it's gonna take. Have
you ever heard of Navy SEAL training?

01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:22.907
<i>- No.
- Well, this is gonna be Roberta's String Training.</i>

01:33:22.942 --> 01:33:26.243
- It's gonna be tough. It's gonna be rough.
- Hi, Roberta.

01:33:26.278 --> 01:33:29.144
Oh, Naeem! Oh!

01:33:29.179 --> 01:33:31.446
Great!
I'm so glad you came.

01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:34.367
<i>- Roberta!
- Guadalupe, is that you? Oh.</i>

01:33:34.402 --> 01:33:37.219
<i>Oh, I'm good, I'm good.</i>

01:33:37.254 --> 01:33:39.221
Now, I'm grea...
That's not Lucy.

01:33:39.256 --> 01:33:43.249
Oh! Oh, guys, this is so great.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.997
- And DeSean? You're a monster. You're huge!
- How you doing?

01:33:47.032 --> 01:33:50.990
You grew a little.

01:33:51.034 --> 01:33:53.936
You guys,
you grew a little bit.

01:33:53.971 --> 01:33:57.735
Okay, these are four of my... not my
best students, but my first students.

01:33:57.770 --> 01:34:01.500
- They've agreed to come and play
in the concert with you guys.

01:34:03.413 --> 01:34:07.150
I'm trying to tell them how hard
they're gonna have to work. All right?

01:34:07.185 --> 01:34:10.287
<i>Take it from me,
you gotta work your butts off.</i>

01:34:10.322 --> 01:34:14.280
<i>Six weeks to this concert.</i>

01:34:39.182 --> 01:34:41.701
Hey, Carlos, where you going?
We got a game, remember?

01:34:41.736 --> 01:34:44.221
- Yeah, but I can't make it.
- What are you talking about?

01:34:44.256 --> 01:34:46.288
Look, I just can't make it.

01:34:46.323 --> 01:34:50.027
What? Do you have a date
with the violin teacher?

01:34:50.062 --> 01:34:54.020
Yeah, I do.
Give me that.

01:35:04.541 --> 01:35:07.943
More bow!

01:35:07.978 --> 01:35:09.945
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.150
My God, you sound...
Is anybody practicing at all?

01:35:13.185 --> 01:35:16.285
How can we practice?
We're rehearsing all the time.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.688
- Oh, that's funny. You think
that's funny, Stephanie?

01:35:19.723 --> 01:35:23.727
<i>You think the 400 people that have
bought tickets so far are gonna think...</i>

01:35:23.762 --> 01:35:27.720
You think Itzhak Perlman is gonna
think it's funny?

01:35:28.065 --> 01:35:31.335
I'm not trying
to beat you kids up.

01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:33.302
I'm really not.

01:35:33.337 --> 01:35:35.304
But I know two things.

01:35:35.339 --> 01:35:37.572
One: If this program
disappears next year,

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:41.600
you're gonna look around, and you're
gonna really, really miss it.

01:35:44.081 --> 01:35:48.074
Two: If you have
a hand in saving it,

01:35:49.052 --> 01:35:52.020
<i>each one of you,</i>

01:35:52.055 --> 01:35:54.324
you're gonna feel
real good.

01:35:54.359 --> 01:35:56.325
Real good.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.353
Boy, that will be better than any lesson
I can teach you in class.

01:36:00.497 --> 01:36:04.490
It's gonna be worth it,
so please hang in there with me.

01:36:06.236 --> 01:36:10.073
Oh, you know, I cannot believe
I ever agreed to do this!

01:36:10.108 --> 01:36:11.773
These kids are never
gonna be ready.

01:36:11.808 --> 01:36:15.545
You should hear the Bach double.
It's a complete disaster.

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:18.113
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:36:18.148 --> 01:36:20.484
The good news is the tickets
are selling like hotcakes.

01:36:20.519 --> 01:36:22.786
The bad news is the kids
sound like sh...

01:36:22.821 --> 01:36:26.273
- There's more bad news.
- What?

01:36:26.308 --> 01:36:29.691
- We've lost the "Y."
- What?

01:36:29.726 --> 01:36:31.693
They had a flood.
A water heater burst.

01:36:31.728 --> 01:36:35.132
The concert hall was damaged,
and they've canceled all events.

01:36:35.167 --> 01:36:36.598
Until when?

01:36:36.633 --> 01:36:39.735
<i>- Until further notice.
- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:43.407
This can't happen. We've sold tickets.
We've done publicity.

01:36:43.442 --> 01:36:46.041
We have a concert
in three weeks.

01:36:46.076 --> 01:36:49.413
I've been on the phone
all morning calling other theaters.

01:36:49.448 --> 01:36:53.406
<i>Nothing's available.</i>

01:37:08.165 --> 01:37:11.566
<i>- Come on.
- The teacher's late.</i>

01:37:11.601 --> 01:37:15.404
You know, I think she should
be dropped, don't you?

01:37:15.439 --> 01:37:19.432
- Yeah, I don't know if we should let her play in Fiddlefest.
- Yeah.

01:37:34.191 --> 01:37:37.744
Check it out.
Here you go, youngster.

01:37:37.779 --> 01:37:41.263
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, somebody gave us money!</i>

01:37:41.298 --> 01:37:44.835
Stop. No, hold it.
Are you guys kidding me?

01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:47.204
<i>You have
to have more bow.</i>

01:37:47.239 --> 01:37:49.504
And you gotta go
to the frog.

01:37:49.539 --> 01:37:52.674
You guys sound terrible.
I can't believe how terrible you sound.

01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:56.244
<i>- You're gonna make everybody
sick to their stomachs.</i>

01:37:56.279 --> 01:37:59.216
<i>They're gonna pay $ 1,000 a ticket,
and you're gonna make them throw up.</i>

01:37:59.251 --> 01:38:03.209
Carlos...
you imitating me?

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.413
If you're imitating me, you should
do it right. Stand up straight.

01:38:08.925 --> 01:38:11.077
Put that violin up.
Higher, higher.

01:38:11.112 --> 01:38:13.230
Look at your feet.
All crooked.

01:38:13.265 --> 01:38:15.764
Come on, continue.

01:38:15.799 --> 01:38:18.266
That's okay.
You can take it from here.

01:38:18.301 --> 01:38:21.703
Yeah. He's right, you know?
You do sound terrible,

01:38:21.738 --> 01:38:24.841
and you are gonna make everybody sick
to their stomachs.

01:38:24.876 --> 01:38:27.609
<i>Rachel! I can't believe
you're late. Hurry up.</i>

01:38:27.644 --> 01:38:31.637
- I need to talk to you.
- All right, go on in, everybody.

01:38:31.815 --> 01:38:34.182
<i>Start on the Minuet 1, okay?</i>

01:38:34.217 --> 01:38:38.210
<i>I'll be there in a minute.
Hurry up, hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go.</i>

01:38:40.157 --> 01:38:42.124
What's up?

01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:44.828
We're moving away.

01:38:44.863 --> 01:38:47.497
You're moving?
Where?

01:38:47.532 --> 01:38:50.929
It's a secret.

01:38:50.964 --> 01:38:54.326
My father...

01:38:54.504 --> 01:38:57.524
has been hurting my mom.

01:38:57.559 --> 01:39:00.509
So we have to get away.

01:39:00.544 --> 01:39:04.537
Has he been hurting you too?

01:39:06.816 --> 01:39:09.819
I'm sorry
about Juilliard...

01:39:09.854 --> 01:39:13.812
and about the concert.

01:39:14.991 --> 01:39:18.984
What? No. I'm not gonna take your
violin. That's yours. You keep that.

01:39:19.262 --> 01:39:21.731
- No, I don't want it.
- You can't give this up.

01:39:21.766 --> 01:39:25.724
It's a very
important part of you.

01:39:50.393 --> 01:39:52.827
<i>Do the kids know we lost the "Y"?</i>

01:39:52.862 --> 01:39:54.996
<i>- No.
- We gotta find a place.</i>

01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:58.835
<i>- What about the Bronx?
- What about... What about Cleveland?</i>

01:39:58.870 --> 01:40:00.802
We can have it
in Cleveland.

01:40:00.837 --> 01:40:03.004
Mom, no one's gonna go
to the Bronx.

01:40:03.039 --> 01:40:05.408
You gotta have it at one
of the schools. It'll be smaller...

01:40:05.443 --> 01:40:07.409
I can't have it
at a school because...

01:40:07.444 --> 01:40:09.512
- there will not be enough money raised.
- "Enough money."

01:40:09.547 --> 01:40:11.680
No, because it's too small.

01:40:11.715 --> 01:40:13.883
- Then just postpone it.
- I can't postpone it.

01:40:13.918 --> 01:40:16.019
- Why not?
- Because Steinhardt is booked.

01:40:16.054 --> 01:40:18.420
Perlman's booked
all summer long.

01:40:18.455 --> 01:40:21.458
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

01:40:24.294 --> 01:40:28.031
<i>Roberta! It's me! Are you there?</i>

01:40:28.066 --> 01:40:30.732
What is she doing here?

01:40:30.767 --> 01:40:34.760
Hello, hello. I have good news!
Really good news!

01:40:35.338 --> 01:40:37.340
Arnold got a call from
his friend Wally Schurer...

01:40:37.375 --> 01:40:39.307
who heard about us
losing the "Y,"

01:40:39.342 --> 01:40:41.710
and he wanted to see
how he could help.

01:40:41.745 --> 01:40:44.314
Then Wally had this brilliant idea
and called his friend Isaac Stern,

01:40:44.349 --> 01:40:46.281
and it's all arranged.

01:40:46.316 --> 01:40:48.285
We have a new place
for Fiddlefest.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:51.755
- Where?
- Carnegie Hall.

01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:54.491
Oh, my God!

01:40:56.726 --> 01:40:58.693
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

01:40:58.728 --> 01:41:02.048
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, my...

01:41:02.083 --> 01:41:05.333
<i>Isn't this terrific?</i>

01:41:05.368 --> 01:41:07.837
- It's fantastic!
- It's huge!

01:41:07.872 --> 01:41:10.307
- You're a genius.
- Thank you.

01:41:10.342 --> 01:41:13.043
Whoa!
That's fantastic!

01:41:13.078 --> 01:41:15.710
- Oh, jeez.
- What?

01:41:15.745 --> 01:41:17.712
<i>- We can't play at Carnegie Hall.
- Mom!</i>

01:41:17.747 --> 01:41:19.749
<i>- No, I mean, you know...
- Yeah, you can.</i>

01:41:19.784 --> 01:41:23.742
<i>- Mom.
- It's fantastic.</i>

01:42:05.028 --> 01:42:07.947
<i>Amazing sound, isn't it?</i>

01:42:07.982 --> 01:42:10.832
You must be Roberta.

01:42:10.867 --> 01:42:13.702
- Mr. Stern.
- I was working upstairs...

01:42:13.737 --> 01:42:16.504
and I thought I'd come down
and just welcome you.

01:42:16.539 --> 01:42:18.940
- It's so nice to have you here
in this house.

01:42:18.975 --> 01:42:22.112
Thank you very much
for your help bringing us here.

01:42:22.147 --> 01:42:25.127
Let me show you something.

01:42:25.162 --> 01:42:28.107
If you're very,
very quiet...

01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:32.533
listen and you can hear
Tchaikovsky...

01:42:32.568 --> 01:42:35.547
conducting
the opening concert in 1891.

01:42:38.528 --> 01:42:41.764
And if you listen over there,
you'll hear Jascha Heifetz.

01:42:41.799 --> 01:42:44.966
If you listen over there,
you'll hear Sergey Rachmaninoff.

01:42:45.001 --> 01:42:48.994
<i>And right over here is where
Vladimir Horowitz played on his piano.</i>

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:54.144
And they're all here
in the walls...

01:42:54.179 --> 01:42:57.112
to welcome all
who come here.

01:42:57.147 --> 01:42:59.681
- This is what Carnegie is for,
- Yeah.

01:42:59.716 --> 01:43:02.936
And we are so happy that you
and the children are coming.

01:43:02.971 --> 01:43:06.156
I'm very, very grateful
that you're giving us a chance.

01:43:06.191 --> 01:43:09.057
- I want to ask you a favor.
- Mm-hmm.

01:43:09.092 --> 01:43:13.085
Could I, with a couple of friends,
come and join with you and the kids?

01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:16.798
- We'd love to help.
- Really?

01:43:16.833 --> 01:43:19.235
That would be...
That would be fantastic.

01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:21.536
Well, we'd love
to be part of it.

01:43:21.571 --> 01:43:25.206
Oh, my God, yes.
I mean, yeah, that would be...

01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:28.978
You do such special work.
It's just a way of saying thank you.

01:43:29.013 --> 01:43:32.849
And don't worry.
It will work out. I promise you.

01:43:32.884 --> 01:43:34.984
From your mouth to God's ear.

01:43:44.661 --> 01:43:45.727
<i>Which earrings?</i>

01:43:45.762 --> 01:43:48.998
- Here.
- I'm not gonna wear earrings, Ma. I'm gonna play the violin.

01:43:49.033 --> 01:43:51.566
- At Carnegie Hall.
- Get me two more violins.

01:43:51.601 --> 01:43:53.603
- You can't go to Carnegie Hall...
Ma, you got two already.

01:43:53.638 --> 01:43:57.057
- How many emergencies can there be?
- Get... three.

01:43:57.092 --> 01:44:00.477
And make sure that, um,
two of them are half size.

01:44:00.512 --> 01:44:02.444
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

01:44:02.479 --> 01:44:04.446
Lexi, will you call
the car company?

01:44:04.481 --> 01:44:06.483
Mom, they're not gonna
forget to send the car. It will be here.

01:44:06.518 --> 01:44:08.751
- Make sure that, that they're gonna...
- Mom.

01:44:08.786 --> 01:44:11.519
- Yeah?
- What are you doing? Mom...

01:44:11.554 --> 01:44:13.788
- I'm trying to straighten up.
- Mom, you're insane, you know that?

01:44:13.823 --> 01:44:17.760
<i>- It's okay, though. Come on, just get dressed.
- Hang up your nightgown.</i>

01:44:17.795 --> 01:44:19.961
Okay. I'll put
this last one in.

01:44:19.996 --> 01:44:22.131
- I think I'm gonna forget it.
- No, you are not.

01:44:22.166 --> 01:44:25.702
You're gonna be just fine.
Look here.

01:44:25.737 --> 01:44:29.072
Beautiful. Beautiful.

01:44:29.107 --> 01:44:31.074
Ah, Maria.

01:44:33.643 --> 01:44:37.013
<i>I'll be down in a minute!</i>

01:44:39.015 --> 01:44:40.982
Yes!

01:44:41.017 --> 01:44:43.985
<i>Mommy! Ma!</i>

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:47.255
My God, I caught
the hem on my heel,

01:44:47.290 --> 01:44:50.159
and I can't thread the needle
because my hand is shaking.

01:44:50.194 --> 01:44:52.560
<i>Here.</i>

01:44:52.595 --> 01:44:56.032
- It's not time. It can't be time.
- It's time.

01:44:56.067 --> 01:45:00.025
I'll sew it in the car.

01:45:04.674 --> 01:45:06.641
Oh, my gosh!

01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:08.294
<i>I told you they'd send a car.</i>

01:45:08.329 --> 01:45:09.878
<i>- Hi, Roberta!
- Hi!</i>

01:45:09.913 --> 01:45:11.214
<i>Hi, Mrs. Johnson.</i>

01:45:11.249 --> 01:45:13.181
Thank you.

01:45:13.216 --> 01:45:16.951
Give me that skirt.

01:45:16.986 --> 01:45:19.756
- There it is.
- Oh, that's not so bad.

01:45:19.791 --> 01:45:23.749
Thank you, Ma.

01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:26.828
Don't worry about it.
You rip, I sew.

01:45:26.863 --> 01:45:29.866
Not just for that.
For getting me out of bed.

01:45:29.901 --> 01:45:33.069
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank Charles.

01:45:33.104 --> 01:45:35.937
What? Why Charles?

01:45:35.972 --> 01:45:39.965
If he hadn't left you,
none of this would have happened.

01:45:44.881 --> 01:45:48.874
Well, thank you, Charles.

01:45:49.786 --> 01:45:53.779
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay!</i>

01:45:58.394 --> 01:46:01.931
- Vanessa's missing in action.
- Oh, my God. Did you call her mother and her father?

01:46:01.966 --> 01:46:04.400
- You know, it's two separate places...
- No answer at either!

01:46:04.435 --> 01:46:07.869
- They stole the car.
- What?

01:46:07.904 --> 01:46:11.307
- And the violin was in the car.
- Oh, no. You okay? Nick! Lexi!

01:46:11.342 --> 01:46:14.410
<i>- I need an extra violin!
- Done. It's done.</i>

01:46:14.445 --> 01:46:16.644
Oh, congratulations.

01:46:16.679 --> 01:46:18.681
- It is so beautiful.
- Carnegie Hall.

01:46:18.716 --> 01:46:20.648
- I know.
- Hi.

01:46:20.683 --> 01:46:22.685
Thanks for coming on time, buddy.

01:46:28.725 --> 01:46:32.729
It is you.
Oh, my gosh.

01:46:32.764 --> 01:46:34.729
Congratulations.

01:46:34.764 --> 01:46:38.757
I knew you'd get here, sooner or later.

01:46:40.236 --> 01:46:42.403
Well, thanks.

01:46:42.438 --> 01:46:45.008
I'm just glad
I'm here to see it.

01:46:45.043 --> 01:46:48.123
I'm really glad you are too.

01:46:48.158 --> 01:46:51.203
- Break a leg.
- Thanks.

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.982
Can I have your attention,
please?

01:46:54.017 --> 01:46:58.010
This is the five-minute call.
We now have five minutes.

01:46:58.054 --> 01:47:01.990
<i>Oh.</i>

01:47:02.025 --> 01:47:06.018
Galahad.
Thank you so much.

01:47:06.763 --> 01:47:08.663
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:47:08.698 --> 01:47:11.834
- You're glowing.
- Oh... well, it's terror.

01:47:11.869 --> 01:47:15.737
Thank you.

01:47:15.772 --> 01:47:18.072
If I get through this night...

01:47:18.107 --> 01:47:20.943
Okay, everybody!
Everybody, hey! Come here!

01:47:24.814 --> 01:47:27.183
I just need your attention
for a second.

01:47:27.218 --> 01:47:30.685
Can't see you all.
Okay?

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:34.713
All right, I just want you all to take
a second... and just breathe, okay?

01:47:36.059 --> 01:47:39.060
<i>Deep breath.</i>

01:47:39.095 --> 01:47:42.463
That's good.

01:47:42.498 --> 01:47:46.491
<i>Ten years ago,
Roberta Guaspari-Demetras...</i>

01:47:46.736 --> 01:47:49.939
walked into my office
because she needed a job.

01:47:49.974 --> 01:47:53.142
<i>And, because
she had a vision...</i>

01:47:53.177 --> 01:47:55.109
that any child...

01:47:55.144 --> 01:47:57.912
could learn
to play the violin,

01:47:57.947 --> 01:48:01.884
<i>together we created
the East Harlem Violin Program,</i>

01:48:01.919 --> 01:48:05.154
through which more than
a thousand students...

01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:07.789
have expanded
their vision...

01:48:07.824 --> 01:48:11.817
<i>of what is possible
in their lives.</i>

01:48:12.829 --> 01:48:16.822
<i>When a program like this is cut,
our children's future is compromised.</i>

01:48:18.534 --> 01:48:22.527
I want to thank each of you
for your generous support,

01:48:23.339 --> 01:48:27.332
and I sincerely hope
that you enjoy the concert.

01:48:28.411 --> 01:48:32.404
Thank you.

01:48:34.417 --> 01:48:36.384
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:48:36.419 --> 01:48:39.956
I would like you all to play...

01:48:39.991 --> 01:48:42.957
from your heart.

01:48:42.992 --> 01:48:44.892
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

01:48:44.927 --> 01:48:47.029
Play like I know you can play.

01:48:47.064 --> 01:48:49.097
<i>Don't look at the audience.</i>

01:48:49.132 --> 01:48:53.125
Watch me.
You do not have to be afraid.

01:48:54.337 --> 01:48:58.330
You are going to be really,
really wonderful tonight.

01:49:01.344 --> 01:49:05.337
Just play from here.

01:49:06.182 --> 01:49:09.585
I'm so proud of you.

01:49:14.123 --> 01:49:16.090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:49:16.125 --> 01:49:18.928
<i>the children of the East Harlem
Violin Program,</i>

01:49:18.963 --> 01:49:22.921
<i>led by their teacher
Roberta Guaspari.</i>

01:51:21.484 --> 01:51:25.315
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
a man who has long been considered...</i>

01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:29.147
<i>the most sought-after and accomplished
fiddler in Nashville, Mark O'Connor.</i>

01:52:42.798 --> 01:52:45.801
Yeah!

01:52:48.704 --> 01:52:50.671
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:52:50.706 --> 01:52:53.525
<i>as a conclusion to this evening's
wonderful concert,</i>

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:56.310
<i>we present to you a group
of international artists...</i>

01:52:56.345 --> 01:53:00.338
<i>who have united in support
of the East Harlem Violin Program.</i>

01:53:00.683 --> 01:53:04.320
<i>It is our great pleasure
to introduce to you: Michael Tree,</i>

01:53:04.355 --> 01:53:06.856
<i>Charles Veal, Jr.,</i>

01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:09.323
<i>Arnold Steinhardt,</i>

01:53:09.358 --> 01:53:12.194
<i>Karen Briggs,
Itzhak Perlman,</i>

01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:15.131
<i>Isaac Stern,
Sandra Park,</i>

01:53:15.166 --> 01:53:18.034
<i>Diane Monroe,
Joshua Bell,</i>

01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:20.101
<i>and Mark O'Connor.</i>

01:53:20.136 --> 01:53:23.204
<i>At the piano,
Jonathan Feldman.</i>

01:53:23.239 --> 01:53:25.206
<i>Performing their unique
ensemble version...</i>

01:53:25.241 --> 01:53:29.234
<i>of Bach's Concerto in D Minor
for Two Violins.</i>

01:55:42.378 --> 01:55:46.371
Bravo!

01:56:06.735 --> 01:56:10.728
Come, come,
come, come, come!

01:56:16.312 --> 01:56:19.682
That's my daughter.
That's my daughter.

01:56:19.717 --> 01:56:23.675
And bow.

01:57:15.471 --> 01:57:19.464
When we play the violin, we play
right across those holes because...

01:57:19.541 --> 01:57:21.877
<i>that's where it resonates,
that's where the sound is nice.</i>

01:57:21.912 --> 01:57:24.831
Okay, we're gonna talk
about the bow again.

01:57:24.866 --> 01:57:27.750
- Who remembers what this is?
- Ooh, I know!

01:57:27.785 --> 01:57:29.383
- Yes?
- Frog hair.

01:57:29.418 --> 01:57:32.755
It's... "Frog hair"?
Did you ever see a frog with hair?

01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:34.755
No.

01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:37.291
- No. So what is it?
- Horsehair?

01:57:37.326 --> 01:57:39.995
H-Horse's hair.
That's right, that's right.

01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:43.344
But he's right.
There is a frog here somewhere.

01:57:43.379 --> 01:57:46.658
<i>Let him answer.</i>

01:57:47.369 --> 01:57:49.770
<i>That's right.
That's a frog.</i>

01:57:49.805 --> 01:57:53.440
See him? His little eye?

01:57:53.475 --> 01:57:57.468
Okay, now why do they use horsehair?
Does anybody know?

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:00.714
<i>- Yes?
- It's strong and soft.</i>

01:58:00.749 --> 01:58:02.716
Because it's strong.
A horse's tail...

01:58:02.751 --> 01:58:05.853
The hair is very strong,
and it's very soft.

01:58:05.888 --> 01:58:09.124
That's nice because
when we put the bow on the string,

01:58:09.159 --> 01:58:13.117
it makes a lovely sound.

01:58:31.847 --> 01:58:34.548
<i>You'll never know</i>

01:58:34.583 --> 01:58:38.576
<i>What you've done for me</i>

01:58:38.721 --> 01:58:42.714
<i>What your faith in me</i>

01:58:43.158 --> 01:58:47.151
<i>Has done for my soul</i>

01:58:48.864 --> 01:58:50.831
<i>And you'll never know</i>

01:58:50.866 --> 01:58:54.859
<i>The gift you've given me</i>

01:58:55.471 --> 01:58:59.464
<i>I'll carry it with me</i>

01:58:59.608 --> 01:59:02.142
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:59:02.177 --> 01:59:05.163
<i>Through the days ahead</i>

01:59:05.198 --> 01:59:08.115
<i>I think of Days before</i>

01:59:08.150 --> 01:59:12.143
<i>You made me hope
for something better</i>

01:59:12.554 --> 01:59:16.558
<i>- Yes, you did
- And made me reach for something more</i>

01:59:16.593 --> 01:59:18.878
<i>You taught me to run</i>

01:59:18.913 --> 01:59:21.128
<i>You taught me to fly</i>

01:59:21.163 --> 01:59:25.156
<i>Helped me
to free the me inside</i>

01:59:25.734 --> 01:59:29.727
<i>Helped me hear
the music of my heart</i>

01:59:30.005 --> 01:59:33.876
<i>- Helped me hear the music of my heart
- Yeah, yeah</i>

01:59:33.911 --> 01:59:37.811
<i>You opened my eyes
You opened the door</i>

01:59:37.846 --> 01:59:41.839
<i>- To something I'd never known before
- Ooh, ooh</i>

01:59:43.585 --> 01:59:46.521
<i>- And your love
- Your love</i>

01:59:46.556 --> 01:59:50.003
<i>Is the music
of my heart</i>

01:59:50.038 --> 01:59:53.451
<i>The music of my heart</i>

01:59:53.595 --> 01:59:55.829
<i>You were the one</i>

01:59:55.864 --> 01:59:59.857
<i>- Always on my side
- Always on my side</i>

02:00:00.602 --> 02:00:04.595
<i>- Always standing by
- Always standing by</i>

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:09.033
<i>Seeing me through</i>

02:00:10.546 --> 02:00:14.539
<i>You were the song
that always made me sing</i>

02:00:16.518 --> 02:00:18.519
<i>I'm singing this for you</i>

02:00:18.554 --> 02:00:22.547
<i>I'm singing this
for you, baby</i>

02:00:23.225 --> 02:00:26.226
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:28.829
<i>I'll think
of where I've been</i>

02:00:28.864 --> 02:00:32.857
<i>- Think of where I've been
- And of the one who knew me better</i>

02:00:34.002 --> 02:00:38.006
<i>Than anyone
ever will again</i>

02:00:38.041 --> 02:00:40.459
<i>You taught me to run</i>

02:00:40.494 --> 02:00:42.843
<i>You taught me to fly</i>

02:00:42.878 --> 02:00:46.871
<i>Helped me
to free the me inside</i>

02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:51.142
<i>Helped me hear
the music of my heart</i>

02:00:51.286 --> 02:00:55.023
<i>Helped me hear
the music of my heart</i>

02:00:55.058 --> 02:00:57.257
<i>You opened my eyes</i>

02:00:57.292 --> 02:00:59.595
<i>- You opened the door
- You opened the door</i>

02:00:59.630 --> 02:01:02.898
<i>To something
I'd never known before</i>

02:01:02.933 --> 02:01:05.866
<i>- Oh
- And your love</i>

02:01:05.901 --> 02:01:09.894
<i>Your love
is the music of my heart</i>

02:01:10.839 --> 02:01:14.243
<i>Music of my heart</i>

02:01:14.278 --> 02:01:16.944
<i>Your love</i>

02:01:16.979 --> 02:01:20.972
<i>Helped me hear
the music of my heart</i>

02:01:22.985 --> 02:01:26.978
<i>Hey, yeah</i>

02:01:27.656 --> 02:01:30.557
<i>What you taught me</i>

02:01:30.592 --> 02:01:34.228
<i>Only your love
could ever teach me</i>

02:01:34.263 --> 02:01:38.256
<i>You got through where
no one could reach me</i>

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.593
<i>Before</i>

02:01:43.005 --> 02:01:46.998
<i>Because you always
saw in me</i>

02:01:47.276 --> 02:01:51.269
<i>All the best
that I could be</i>

02:01:51.613 --> 02:01:55.606
