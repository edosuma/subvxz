WEBVTT

00:00.867 --> 00:03.036
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:03.060 --> 00:05.963
I'm humiliated. You've humiliated me.

00:05.987 --> 00:08.199
- I'm so sorry.
- It's not good enough.

00:08.223 --> 00:09.572
How long has that been going on?

00:09.596 --> 00:11.001
See, I don't open up to many people.

00:11.025 --> 00:12.431
With you...

00:13.468 --> 00:14.805
- ...it's easy.
- Somebody call 911!

00:14.829 --> 00:17.240
If you're looking for family
to update, I'm his sister.

00:17.264 --> 00:19.710
Updates are technically
just for family members.

00:19.734 --> 00:22.613
I was really ready to spend
the rest of my life with you.

00:22.637 --> 00:26.114
I get to spend the rest of mine with you.

00:30.411 --> 00:34.625
Have you ever experienced
pain or worry or loss?

00:34.649 --> 00:36.693
Are we sure
- Vic's gonna want breakfast?

00:36.717 --> 00:38.662
Well, she's come out
of that room exactly once

00:38.686 --> 00:39.796
since she's been crashing here.

00:39.820 --> 00:40.872
She needs to eat.

00:40.896 --> 00:42.165
What do we say when we go in there?

00:42.189 --> 00:43.866
Let's just follow her lead.

00:43.890 --> 00:47.051
And, at the very least,
shove some toast in her mouth.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.180
Hey, Vic?

00:57.204 --> 00:58.714
We just wanted to check in.

00:58.738 --> 00:59.715
We... We have food.

00:59.739 --> 01:01.606
Vic, we're coming in, okay?

01:04.744 --> 01:05.919
Vic?

01:06.613 --> 01:08.091
Uh, she's gone.

01:08.115 --> 01:09.859
Should we be worried?

01:09.883 --> 01:11.494
I-I'm sure she wanted space.

01:11.518 --> 01:13.596
- Here. Um, maybe I should call her.
- You want me to call?

01:13.620 --> 01:14.997
- Uh...
- Or we can do it together.

01:15.021 --> 01:16.466
- Uh, no, y-yeah, whatever you want.
- Great.

01:16.490 --> 01:17.867
You're right. She probably
just needed some air.

01:17.891 --> 01:19.869
How about I just text her?

01:19.893 --> 01:21.392
She may not want to talk.

01:22.295 --> 01:24.130
At some point...

01:24.798 --> 01:27.209
not now, obviously, but sometime,

01:27.233 --> 01:30.678
do you think... you and I should talk?

01:32.071 --> 01:35.183
Let's just focus on Vic right now, okay?

01:35.742 --> 01:38.553
Have you ever experienced trauma?

01:40.212 --> 01:43.046
Have you ever experienced doubt?

01:46.685 --> 01:48.029
Of course you have.

01:48.053 --> 01:49.564
Everyone has.

01:49.588 --> 01:50.782
Couldn't sleep?

02:05.938 --> 02:09.783
He walked in that building
and came out a dead man.

02:09.808 --> 02:11.852
That could've been any one of us.

02:11.876 --> 02:14.810
On any day, any call.

02:16.014 --> 02:17.258
I know.

02:18.950 --> 02:20.928
I know.

02:20.952 --> 02:23.364
We all live through things that test us.

02:27.825 --> 02:30.804
It's how we each cope...

02:33.532 --> 02:36.119
...how we process, that says the most.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.686
Do we face our pain and own it?

02:45.309 --> 02:47.921
Or are we more comfortable...

02:47.945 --> 02:49.110
Good morning.

02:49.134 --> 02:50.657
Um, your usual.

02:50.681 --> 02:51.891
Yeah, I'll just have the one today.

02:51.915 --> 02:54.161
Oh. Okay, my mistake.

02:54.185 --> 02:55.584
What's your hubby up to?

02:56.753 --> 02:58.765
- He's at work.
- Hm.

02:58.789 --> 03:00.967
...living in denial?

03:07.164 --> 03:09.598
It's almost time for shift.

03:10.468 --> 03:13.012
I-I lost track of time.

03:13.036 --> 03:14.719
Haven't heard from you
since the hospital.

03:14.743 --> 03:17.016
I'm sorry. I've been helping
Jennifer with the arrangements.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.051
Mm.

03:18.075 --> 03:20.872
The department sent over
a checklist a mile long.

03:21.745 --> 03:23.791
And she, uh...

03:24.314 --> 03:26.392
She asked me to give the eulogy.

03:26.416 --> 03:27.760
Mm.

03:27.784 --> 03:29.328
Any advice?

03:29.352 --> 03:32.565
Mm. Wrong person to ask.

03:32.589 --> 03:35.034
Speeches are not my thing.

03:35.058 --> 03:36.245
Funerals aren't either.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.840
Everything okay?

03:40.864 --> 03:42.842
The wildfire that hit L.A.
earlier this week

03:42.866 --> 03:44.043
has progressed.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.444
Crews are requesting backup supplies.

03:45.468 --> 03:47.212
Seattle stations
are organizing a caravan.

03:47.236 --> 03:49.715
Well, I'll handle it...
and whatever else.

03:49.739 --> 03:52.350
I mean, you... you have
a lot going on right now.

03:52.374 --> 03:54.219
And the work will be good
for me... for everyone.

03:54.243 --> 03:56.421
Take our mind off things.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.623
I appreciate it.

03:57.647 --> 04:00.649
Hey, uh, you mind taking a crack
at this eulogy for me, too?

04:00.673 --> 04:03.623
Like I said, wrong person to ask.

04:12.227 --> 04:13.808
Are you crying?

04:13.832 --> 04:15.135
No.

04:15.159 --> 04:16.908
Then what's in your eyes?

04:16.932 --> 04:19.444
I said I wasn't crying, and I meant it.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.946
You don't need to feel
embarrassed about this.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.015
We're all a little messed up over Ripley.

04:24.039 --> 04:26.373
My head's kind of
all over the place, too.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.554
- You want me to grab you a tissue?
- Nope.

04:29.578 --> 04:31.189
You gonna grab one yourself?

04:31.213 --> 04:33.358
- Negative, 'cause I don't need one.
- I think you do.

04:33.382 --> 04:34.992
No, I don't, because I'm not crying.

04:35.016 --> 04:36.961
- Do we need to talk about this?
- Absolutely not.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.563
But you always want to talk.

04:38.587 --> 04:39.723
Yeah. Alright, Mom.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.880
Love you. Bye.

04:40.904 --> 04:42.534
You talking with your mom?
With "I-love-yous"?

04:43.758 --> 04:45.102
Chief Ripley kind of reminded me

04:45.126 --> 04:47.004
to appreciate the people I've got

04:47.028 --> 04:48.105
while I've still got them.

04:48.129 --> 04:51.074
Also, now that things
with Nikki are progressing,

04:51.098 --> 04:52.309
my mom has been saying "I love you"

04:52.333 --> 04:53.777
at the end of every call.

04:53.801 --> 04:55.579
Kind of feels rude not to say it back.

04:58.005 --> 05:00.150
Bishop, you okay? Don't forget this.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.653
Okay.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.159
Look at that. Not even 10% contained.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.027
I hope the winds don't shift.

05:11.051 --> 05:12.095
Just got word...

05:12.119 --> 05:14.030
California's requesting supplies.

05:14.054 --> 05:16.633
This one's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

05:16.657 --> 05:18.368
We'll organize shipments
for Seattle departments

05:18.392 --> 05:19.535
to take down to L.A.

05:19.559 --> 05:21.504
It's like bad on top of bad, you know?

05:21.528 --> 05:23.038
First, Ripley dies, and now this.

05:23.062 --> 05:25.174
Seems like we all could
have used a little pause.

05:25.198 --> 05:26.509
Hey, how's Vic?

05:26.533 --> 05:29.412
Uh, she split without
saying goodbye this morning.

05:29.436 --> 05:30.413
How are you doing?

05:30.437 --> 05:32.448
Just my allergies are acting up.

05:32.472 --> 05:34.149
Has anybody heard from Vic today?

05:34.173 --> 05:35.224
Morning!

05:35.248 --> 05:36.985
You guys seeing these wildfires?

05:37.009 --> 05:38.676
This thing just won't stop.

05:42.382 --> 05:44.293
Yeah. Okay.

05:44.317 --> 05:45.661
Okay, go on.

05:45.685 --> 05:47.129
Get all your staring out of your system,

05:47.153 --> 05:49.131
and then let's move on. Okay?

05:49.155 --> 05:51.234
Grieving Little Arm Candy's in the house.

05:51.258 --> 05:52.900
Drinking coffee. Ready to move forward.

05:52.924 --> 05:54.358
We all good now?

05:56.486 --> 05:57.606
Great. Okay.

05:57.630 --> 05:59.708
Back to your regularly scheduled
programs, please.

05:59.732 --> 06:02.176
Hey. You sure you want to be here?

06:02.200 --> 06:05.113
I didn't come to work today 'cause
I didn't want to be here, so...

06:05.137 --> 06:06.080
How about I take you back home?

06:06.104 --> 06:07.215
To Maya and Andy's,

06:07.239 --> 06:09.183
or if you want a change
of scenery, come stay with me.

06:09.207 --> 06:10.685
Why? 'Cause I shouldn't go home home?

06:10.709 --> 06:12.053
Back to the place
I spent so much time with him?

06:12.077 --> 06:12.920
Back to the bed we shared?

06:12.944 --> 06:14.844
You don't want me sleeping in that?

06:19.718 --> 06:21.396
Sorry.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.398
Sorry. That was... That was not fair.

06:23.422 --> 06:25.032
I'd love to come crash after shift,

06:25.056 --> 06:26.600
but right now, I'm working, so...

06:26.624 --> 06:28.302
Vic. We'll all cover for you.

06:28.326 --> 06:30.203
If you have other stuff
you need to be focused on...

06:30.227 --> 06:31.639
You know, it's not a big deal.

06:31.663 --> 06:34.308
Jennifer's handling all the funeral
arrangements and everything, so...

06:34.332 --> 06:37.278
You don't want to be
involved in that, or...

06:37.302 --> 06:38.320
Not really.

06:38.344 --> 06:39.580
I mean, what does it matter?

06:39.604 --> 06:40.581
It's not gonna bring him back.

06:40.605 --> 06:42.249
And I'm not going
to the funeral anyway, so...

06:42.273 --> 06:43.751
Miller, you mind passing me that syrup?

06:43.775 --> 06:45.040
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

06:48.346 --> 06:50.357
Vic, you have...
you have to go to the funeral.

06:50.381 --> 06:52.293
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

06:52.317 --> 06:53.894
You can't just skip it.

06:53.918 --> 06:55.529
Yeah, I can. And I will.

06:55.553 --> 06:57.720
Uh, why hasn't Sullivan
called for lineup yet?

06:58.690 --> 07:01.067
- I'm, um, covering for him today.
- Sweet.

07:01.091 --> 07:03.069
Okay, so, we should just...

07:03.093 --> 07:04.604
start with chores, then, huh?

07:12.136 --> 07:19.901
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

07:20.738 --> 07:23.483
Oh, my God.
Travis, I told you I was fine.

07:23.508 --> 07:24.752
I didn't pick that word just for fun.

07:24.776 --> 07:26.253
I meant it. I'm fine.

07:26.277 --> 07:27.354
Yeah, and I want you to know

07:27.378 --> 07:30.037
that it's okay if you're not... fine.

07:31.349 --> 07:33.961
You know, when Michael died,
I was a wreck.

07:33.985 --> 07:35.596
You know what helped me get through it?

07:35.620 --> 07:37.264
His funeral,

07:37.288 --> 07:39.066
surrounded by other firefighters,

07:39.090 --> 07:40.367
by my friends.

07:40.391 --> 07:41.735
The tradition was actually
really comforting.

07:41.759 --> 07:43.237
And I'm so glad you had that.

07:43.261 --> 07:44.438
I know how meaningful that was for you.

07:44.462 --> 07:45.406
You were his husband.

07:45.430 --> 07:47.241
But me, I don't factor
into this equation.

07:47.265 --> 07:48.809
Funerals aren't designed
for people like me.

07:48.833 --> 07:51.048
There's no special seat for the secret...

07:51.072 --> 07:53.314
Vic, you know you were
so much more than that.

07:53.338 --> 07:55.203
It'll be an important day...
for Jennifer.

07:55.228 --> 07:56.783
She was his actual family, not me.

07:56.807 --> 07:59.409
She can walk front and center
at that procession, not me.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.165
I don't need that. I'm better off here.

08:02.402 --> 08:03.868
And I'm done talking now.

08:06.071 --> 08:08.149
Right in there, guys.

08:09.241 --> 08:10.051
Hey.

08:10.075 --> 08:11.687
P.D. heard about the supply caravan

08:11.711 --> 08:13.221
and wanted to pitch in.

08:13.245 --> 08:14.690
I saw the funeral's on Friday.

08:14.714 --> 08:16.558
A bunch of us will be there
to pay our respects.

08:16.582 --> 08:18.044
Appreciate it.

08:18.584 --> 08:21.410
I'm actually, um, heading
to San Diego the next day.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.903
- Really?
- There's this tactical paramedic

08:22.928 --> 08:24.833
training program... really intensive.

08:24.857 --> 08:25.934
Couple spots opened up last minute,

08:25.958 --> 08:27.770
and, uh, they recruited me.

08:27.794 --> 08:29.605
Wow. That's... Congratulations.

08:29.629 --> 08:30.698
Thanks.

08:31.464 --> 08:33.975
Does that mean you're leaving Seattle?

08:33.999 --> 08:35.477
Well, for a couple of months, yeah.

08:35.501 --> 08:36.525
Could turn into more.

08:36.549 --> 08:37.812
Jenna and I got the call yesterday.

08:37.836 --> 08:39.746
It's really exclusive.
Kind of a big deal.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.616
You're going with Jenna?

08:41.640 --> 08:43.150
That's... That's... That's great.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.386
I'm happy for you. Yeah.

08:44.410 --> 08:45.653
I'm happy for you, too.

08:45.677 --> 08:48.390
And you and Sullivan. That's also great.

08:48.414 --> 08:50.392
Me and... What?

08:50.416 --> 08:51.793
Weren't you two holding hands
at the hospital?

08:51.817 --> 08:52.961
No. That's not...

08:52.985 --> 08:54.429
I mean, yes, we were, but...

08:54.453 --> 08:56.064
No. That's... No.

08:56.088 --> 08:57.732
- No!
- Oh, okay.

08:57.756 --> 09:00.135
I guess maybe I misinterpreted.
My mistake.

09:00.159 --> 09:02.270
 Station 19, respond.

09:02.294 --> 09:04.639
- Aid Car 19, civilian in distress.
- Uh...

09:04.663 --> 09:06.741
You ready, boss? 'Sup, Tanner?

09:06.765 --> 09:08.609
Who does that?

09:08.633 --> 09:10.411
Who just up and takes a job
in a new place

09:10.435 --> 09:12.712
without even telling
the people closest to them?

09:12.736 --> 09:14.648
I did, actually. Twice.

09:14.672 --> 09:16.439
Kind of going on three times,
now that I think about it.

09:17.521 --> 09:18.618
When does Tanner go?

09:18.642 --> 09:20.620
He said he leaves
right after the funeral.

09:24.648 --> 09:25.792
Hey, what's it like?

09:25.816 --> 09:26.793
What's what like?

09:26.817 --> 09:28.795
I've never been
- to a firefighter funeral.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.931
I realize I don't know where to sit,

09:30.955 --> 09:32.699
when to salute, what to expect.

09:32.723 --> 09:36.437
Expect... something beautiful.

09:36.461 --> 09:39.673
It's sad and hard,
but it's also really...

09:39.697 --> 09:41.375
- Well, the Honor Guard will be there.
- Right.

09:41.399 --> 09:43.177
They, uh... They're the ones
with the axes.

09:43.201 --> 09:45.078
And Miller keeps talking about bells.

09:45.102 --> 09:46.646
Near the end of the funeral,

09:46.670 --> 09:49.148
someone will ring twenty
bells... five at a time...

09:49.172 --> 09:51.852
to signify a firefighter's end of watch.

09:51.876 --> 09:53.587
They ring them in every station,

09:53.611 --> 09:56.389
and it's to announce that...

09:56.413 --> 09:59.020
one of us has come home
for the last time.

09:59.717 --> 10:00.961
That is beautiful.

10:00.985 --> 10:02.818
And sad.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.193
My dad rang the bells.

10:06.557 --> 10:08.902
The night of my mom's funeral, too.

10:08.926 --> 10:10.670
We came home,

10:10.694 --> 10:13.807
he went up to their room,
closed the door, and...

10:13.831 --> 10:16.620
I heard him ringing a bell.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.311
And I just sat out in the hall

10:19.335 --> 10:23.883
and listened as he rang it over and over.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.259
Uh, looks like we're here.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.860
Seattle Fire Department!

10:47.564 --> 10:48.741
Dispatch said he called it in himself.

10:48.765 --> 10:50.998
Maybe he lost consciousness.

10:55.137 --> 10:57.582
Hello? Is anyone in here?

10:57.606 --> 10:58.750
Seattle Fire Department!

10:58.774 --> 11:00.452
Yes, help! In here!

11:02.945 --> 11:05.857
Alright. Just give it to me
straight, please.

11:05.881 --> 11:07.426
Is it as bad as it looks?

11:09.952 --> 11:11.463
How bad is it, really?

11:11.487 --> 11:12.597
Nate, I can definitely say

11:12.621 --> 11:13.765
I've seen worse things than this.

11:13.789 --> 11:15.067
I should've been more careful.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.801
It's just that
I-I like to do things myself,

11:16.825 --> 11:18.136
and I should've called someone.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.171
Ow!

11:19.195 --> 11:21.373
Arm of the chandelier
is penetrating pretty deep.

11:21.397 --> 11:22.674
Looks like it's plugging the axillary.

11:22.698 --> 11:24.976
I slipped, and, just like that,
it was falling on top of me.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.743
We are gonna get you out now, Nate.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.212
My life flashed before my eyes.

11:28.236 --> 11:30.247
You never see it coming, do you?

11:30.271 --> 11:32.049
I mean, one minute,
you're just doing what you do,

11:32.073 --> 11:35.141
and the next... it could just be over.

11:36.411 --> 11:38.021
Well, it's not over for you today, Nate.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.290
Okay? We got you.

11:39.314 --> 11:40.591
This is gonna be pretty loud, Nate,

11:40.615 --> 11:41.758
so... just hold still.

11:49.023 --> 11:50.067
Ugh.

11:50.091 --> 11:51.890
Hold on. Hold on.

11:53.828 --> 11:55.928
Yeah, got it.

11:58.866 --> 12:00.477
Wait, you're not gonna
take the whole thing out?

12:00.501 --> 12:01.645
Well, it's plugging a vessel,

12:01.669 --> 12:04.103
so right now, we want it to stay put.

12:05.106 --> 12:06.105
Go.

12:09.094 --> 12:10.186
Ready?

12:10.210 --> 12:11.989
So, what's gonna happen at the hospital?

12:12.013 --> 12:13.090
They're gonna take the whole
thing out there, right?

12:13.114 --> 12:14.691
One, two, three.

12:14.715 --> 12:16.292
Nate, can you hear me?

12:16.316 --> 12:18.862
BP's dropping! He's tachycardic, too.

12:18.886 --> 12:20.097
Didn't even get him to the gurney.

12:20.121 --> 12:22.365
Start another IV.
Prepping norepinephrine.

12:22.389 --> 12:24.189
- Still dropping.
- Pushing now.

12:27.145 --> 12:29.354
Come on, Nate.

12:29.378 --> 12:31.059
Numbers are coming back up.

12:32.716 --> 12:33.894
Ready?

12:33.918 --> 12:35.562
One, two, three.

12:39.757 --> 12:41.568
Am I at the hospital?

12:41.592 --> 12:42.536
Not yet, buddy.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.971
But, uh, we need to get
you there right now.

12:44.995 --> 12:46.406
Why do I feel so weird?

12:46.430 --> 12:47.340
You know, that's normal, Nate.

12:47.364 --> 12:48.909
Your brain was briefly
deprived of oxygen.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.243
But for real, it feels like

12:50.267 --> 12:52.178
there's a brick on my chest or something.

12:52.202 --> 12:53.847
- He's losing consciousness again.
- Damn it!

12:57.807 --> 12:59.284
Can I ask you a personal question?

12:59.308 --> 13:00.786
Uh, it depends on how personal.

13:00.810 --> 13:01.854
I'm pretty much an open book,

13:01.878 --> 13:03.923
but there are some things
I like to keep private.

13:03.947 --> 13:06.224
- Like my birthmarks, for instance...
- Did you write a eulogy?

13:06.248 --> 13:07.949
For your husband?

13:08.952 --> 13:09.862
Look, I'm just asking

13:09.886 --> 13:11.564
because I'm trying
to write one for Ripley.

13:11.588 --> 13:12.865
Sorry. I can't help you.

13:12.889 --> 13:14.939
Of course. No problem.

13:14.963 --> 13:18.136
No, I mean I can't help you
'cause I couldn't help myself.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.874
I couldn't bring myself to say
a word at Michael's service.

13:21.898 --> 13:24.256
You know who did end up speaking, though?

13:24.280 --> 13:25.644
Ripley.

13:25.668 --> 13:28.854
Yeah, he said some really
wonderful things, actually.

13:29.732 --> 13:31.876
- Like what?
- I don't even really remember.

13:32.141 --> 13:34.052
I just remember that it meant a lot,

13:34.076 --> 13:35.753
you know, for the Chief to take the time

13:35.777 --> 13:37.922
to get up there and say words
about my Michael like that.

13:37.946 --> 13:41.158
See, I need to figure out
words that'll do that.

13:42.490 --> 13:43.667
Especially for Hughes.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.871
Oh, I thought you'd heard.

13:45.896 --> 13:48.808
Vic isn't planning on going.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.985
Fact. I'm older than you.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.922
Are we playing a game?

13:58.947 --> 14:01.393
Fact. Because I am older than you,

14:01.418 --> 14:03.861
I, by default, have had
more life experience than you.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.097
- Okay.
- More experience to learn from.

14:06.122 --> 14:08.735
Experience that lets me know things

14:08.760 --> 14:10.805
that you've yet to learn for yourself.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.037
I feel like you're going
somewhere with this,

14:12.062 --> 14:13.123
somewhere I'm probably not gonna like.

14:13.148 --> 14:14.559
- You need bagpipes.
- Pardon?

14:14.583 --> 14:16.027
To drown out your thoughts.

14:16.051 --> 14:17.996
They play at most firefighter funerals.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.297
They're loud and a little
startling at first,

14:20.321 --> 14:21.666
but then you start to feel their hum.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.401
You feel it right inside your chest...

14:23.425 --> 14:24.569
Yeah, I-I, um... I don't need bagpipes.

14:24.593 --> 14:26.080
Oh, you will change your mind
once you experience...

14:26.104 --> 14:27.621
No, I d... I don't need bagpipes.

14:29.031 --> 14:30.408
No offense, sir,

14:30.432 --> 14:31.976
but I also don't need your advice.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.461
Not on this. Excuse me.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.452
Our med kit's almost out of nor-epi now.

14:41.476 --> 14:43.220
Don't say that
like he'll need more of it.

14:43.244 --> 14:44.621
Are you trying to jinx us?

14:44.645 --> 14:45.956
Just want to make a note.

14:47.014 --> 14:50.483
Aah, no, no. This can't happen again.

14:51.619 --> 14:53.997
- BP is 90 over 50 and dropping.
- He's bottoming out.

14:54.021 --> 14:55.533
I'm worried about his airway.

14:55.557 --> 14:56.989
We need to intubate.

14:58.159 --> 15:01.338
At this rate, we'll get him to
the hospital in about a month.

15:01.362 --> 15:03.941
I would rather not try this
at sixty miles an hour.

15:03.965 --> 15:05.023
This has got to be the last thing

15:05.047 --> 15:06.277
that goes wrong with this guy, right?

15:06.301 --> 15:08.845
And the tube is... in.

15:08.869 --> 15:09.955
Bag him.

15:10.671 --> 15:12.049
Okay. Let's load him up.

15:14.508 --> 15:16.508
Quick, quick, quick.

15:17.945 --> 15:19.723
I promised you
it wasn't over today, Nate.

15:19.747 --> 15:21.458
But you got to meet us halfway.

15:21.482 --> 15:23.359
We should be good. Just keep bagging.

15:25.052 --> 15:26.663
Try not to hit any potholes.

15:31.025 --> 15:32.903
Pressure's dropping.
Are fluids on full flow?

15:32.927 --> 15:35.138
Watch the road.
How much longer to the hospital?

15:35.162 --> 15:36.740
Seattle Pres is about 6 minutes out.

15:36.764 --> 15:37.908
Just make sure to keep an eye
on his heart rate.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.111
I said avoid the potholes!

15:41.135 --> 15:43.113
- We may need to use QuikClot.
- I got it, Warren.

15:43.137 --> 15:44.380
It couldn't hurt to hang another bag.

15:44.404 --> 15:46.048
Yeah, it wouldn't hurt you
to drive better.

15:47.441 --> 15:49.328
Are you kidding me, Nate?

15:49.743 --> 15:51.087
V-fib!

15:51.111 --> 15:52.522
- Starting...
- Start the defibrillator!

15:55.528 --> 15:57.327
Shock delivered.

15:57.351 --> 15:58.863
Still in V-fib. Damn it.

16:01.455 --> 16:02.965
Shock delivered.

16:04.324 --> 16:05.635
Pull over, Warren!

16:05.659 --> 16:07.003
But we have to get him to the hospital!

16:07.027 --> 16:08.838
I've just started two-person CPR,

16:08.862 --> 16:09.905
and I only see one of us back here.

16:09.929 --> 16:12.208
So either you put the Aid Car
on cruise control,

16:12.232 --> 16:13.909
or you pull over now!

16:20.428 --> 16:22.307
Come on, Nate. Come on.

16:22.331 --> 16:24.238
He's asystolic.

16:24.265 --> 16:25.376
Run saline wide open.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.576
No, no, no, no, no. Andy, look.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.878
He's bleeding from the impalement.

16:27.902 --> 16:30.080
Every compression is pushing more
and more blood out of his body.

16:30.104 --> 16:32.349
- We can't just stop CPR.
- I know. I know.

16:33.841 --> 16:35.219
Well...

16:35.243 --> 16:36.553
CPR isn't gonna bring him back

16:36.577 --> 16:38.522
if there's no blood left to pump.

16:38.546 --> 16:39.924
We can't work with this thing in.

16:39.948 --> 16:42.426
So we should remove it? He can bleed out.

16:42.450 --> 16:45.261
I'll pack it right away.
And then hold pressure.

16:45.285 --> 16:46.896
Look, it's safer than what he's got now.

16:46.920 --> 16:50.566
Whatever you do,
do not stop compressions.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.078
- Warren.
- Yeah, I know.

17:02.102 --> 17:03.346
- I know.
- This is a lot of blood.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.636
Just a few more seconds.

17:07.107 --> 17:08.272
Ben!

17:09.742 --> 17:10.786
Got it! He's packed!

17:10.810 --> 17:12.978
Holding pressure.

17:16.983 --> 17:18.226
Normal sinus rhythm.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.795
- How far away are we from the hospital?
- About 3 minutes.

17:20.819 --> 17:22.431
- Can you hold pressure that long?
- Hell yeah I can.

17:22.454 --> 17:24.421
Good, 'cause we're not
making any more stops.

17:25.491 --> 17:27.035
Just try not to hit any potholes.

17:32.698 --> 17:34.909
Hughes? Brought somebody to see you.

17:34.933 --> 17:38.746
I thought we could all maybe,
uh, talk for a minute.

17:38.770 --> 17:40.648
I've got to get these organized
for Station 42,

17:40.672 --> 17:41.829
but be my guest.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.052
Okay, I may not be someone

17:44.076 --> 17:45.720
that you're anxious to see right now,

17:45.744 --> 17:47.722
but when Robert called
and said that you weren't...

17:47.746 --> 17:49.724
Vic, you have to be there at the funeral.

17:49.748 --> 17:52.259
- You have to go.
- I have to get these MREs sorted

17:52.283 --> 17:54.362
before the guys from 42
show to pick them up, so...

17:54.386 --> 17:57.365
Wildfire strike teams
are usually 22 firefighters.

17:57.389 --> 18:00.868
Three MREs a day, that makes 66...

18:00.892 --> 18:02.370
Hey.

18:02.394 --> 18:05.026
Why don't you, um, stop for a second.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.407
Okay?

18:06.431 --> 18:07.909
Look, you and Jen

18:07.933 --> 18:09.443
are the most important
people in Luke's life...

18:09.467 --> 18:10.514
You ever had one of these?

18:10.538 --> 18:12.480
It's basically freeze dried food.

18:12.504 --> 18:14.348
It seems pretty gross, but once
you heat it up, it's not that bad.

18:14.372 --> 18:16.936
Okay, Vic. He would've wanted you there.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.653
I want you to be there.

18:18.677 --> 18:20.287
I need you by my side.

18:20.311 --> 18:22.390
You're gonna have an entire
department of people there.

18:22.414 --> 18:24.726
You'll have Captain Sullivan.
You don't need me.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.527
He'd want you there... both of you.

18:26.551 --> 18:29.396
Well, I'm not going, so...

18:29.420 --> 18:31.498
- Please?
- No, I can't. I can't.

18:31.522 --> 18:33.000
Okay? I can't. I'm sorry.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.668
I can't go stand through

18:34.692 --> 18:36.537
a day of being tall
and polished and perfect

18:36.561 --> 18:39.428
a-and celebrating his life when...

18:40.665 --> 18:42.843
You know, I need
to get back to work, so...

18:42.867 --> 18:44.477
Okay.

18:58.382 --> 19:00.526
- Are you really still crying?
- I can't control it.

19:00.550 --> 19:03.495
- Wouldn't hurt to try.
- I am trying, but I can't shut it off.

19:03.519 --> 19:05.264
- Debatable.
- And I hate that I can't shut it off

19:05.288 --> 19:07.633
because I am not a person who cries.

19:07.657 --> 19:10.570
I suck my feelings up, I stuff 'em
down, I embrace the pain,

19:10.594 --> 19:12.538
but today, I just...
I can't make it stop.

19:12.562 --> 19:14.574
So can you just stop
making me feel bad about it?

19:14.598 --> 19:16.709
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad...
- Well, you are.

19:16.733 --> 19:18.410
- It's just a little distracting.
- Oh, my God!

19:18.434 --> 19:19.705
Anemones.

19:20.336 --> 19:22.014
- What did he just say?
- What?

19:22.038 --> 19:23.549
You two are sea anemones.

19:24.001 --> 19:25.417
We're not enemies.

19:25.441 --> 19:27.519
I-I know.

19:27.543 --> 19:29.421
I said sea anemones.

19:29.445 --> 19:30.990
Shady, little underwater invertebrates,

19:31.014 --> 19:33.614
and you got your tentacles
waving all over the place.

19:35.918 --> 19:37.629
- What is he talking about?
- I have no idea.

19:37.653 --> 19:39.497
Squishy, freaky sea predators.

19:39.521 --> 19:41.733
When you strike,
nobody ever sees it coming.

19:41.757 --> 19:42.901
But when you're threatened,

19:42.925 --> 19:45.070
you close yourselves off
into these tiny, little balls

19:45.094 --> 19:46.237
so that nobody can touch you.

19:46.261 --> 19:49.440
And the only time you come out
is to strike each other.

19:49.464 --> 19:52.110
You two got together in a fishbowl.

19:52.134 --> 19:53.544
And now you're wading
through the open sea.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.581
So no wonder you're
having trouble right now.

19:56.605 --> 19:57.742
No wonder you can't figure it out.

19:57.766 --> 20:00.551
No wonder you keep stinging each other.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.453
I hate to say this, but I think
he's starting to make sense.

20:02.477 --> 20:04.589
Maya, do you want to
know why you're crying?

20:04.613 --> 20:06.290
It's because you're sad.

20:06.314 --> 20:08.593
There doesn't have to be
any other reason.

20:08.617 --> 20:10.460
You're sad today. We all are.

20:10.484 --> 20:13.030
And you just so happen to be
wearing it all over your face.

20:13.054 --> 20:15.599
And Jack, you're not really
annoyed with her for crying.

20:15.623 --> 20:18.035
You're in a garbage mood because...

20:18.059 --> 20:21.972
the chief went down, and it's hard.

20:21.996 --> 20:23.874
It's a tough one.

20:23.898 --> 20:26.910
We all thought he was
invincible, and he wasn't.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.746
And it's probably stirring up some stuff.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.614
So just take that in.

20:30.638 --> 20:34.718
Let's sway in this current
and not fight it

20:34.742 --> 20:36.842
and appreciate the fact that
you two are still here today.

20:38.646 --> 20:40.428
And you have each other.

20:44.518 --> 20:46.663
I don't know where all that
sea creature stuff came from,

20:46.687 --> 20:50.504
but, uh... surprisingly helpful, man.

20:51.192 --> 20:52.135
Thank you.

20:52.159 --> 20:53.670
You're welcome.

20:53.694 --> 20:56.473
It all came from Nikki.

20:56.497 --> 20:59.008
She's really observant and communicative,

20:59.032 --> 21:01.778
and somehow, it is rubbing off on me.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.280
She sounds really amazing.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.681
She is.

21:04.705 --> 21:05.748
Blow your nose.

21:05.772 --> 21:07.950
You finally went on that first date, huh?

21:07.974 --> 21:09.952
Uh, we had plans, but I kinda canceled

21:09.976 --> 21:11.721
because grief isn't sexy.

21:12.913 --> 21:15.325
Wait, then why are we taking
relationship advice from him?

21:15.349 --> 21:17.294
Because I am right.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.494
Here.

21:18.518 --> 21:20.329
Blow your nose.

21:20.353 --> 21:21.397
Again.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.604
34-year-old male found impaled
in the chest by a chandelier.

21:28.628 --> 21:29.638
He arrested twice en route...

21:29.662 --> 21:31.708
V-fib the first time
and asystolic the second.

21:31.732 --> 21:33.176
We initiated CPR

21:33.200 --> 21:34.944
and intubated
with a total of four shocks,

21:34.968 --> 21:35.999
epi, and a norepi drip.

21:36.023 --> 21:37.914
Oh, and we removed his impalement.

21:37.938 --> 21:39.048
That it?

21:39.072 --> 21:40.183
We'll take it from here.

21:40.207 --> 21:42.018
Thank you.

21:42.042 --> 21:43.720
Whew.

21:43.744 --> 21:45.354
You know, I don't think
I have taken a breath

21:45.378 --> 21:47.223
since we kicked down Nate's door.

21:47.247 --> 21:48.791
What?

21:48.815 --> 21:50.893
Nothing. Just... you have no idea.

21:50.917 --> 21:53.128
I... Today was already
one thing after another,

21:53.152 --> 21:56.164
and I thought the call would
take my mind off all the things,

21:56.188 --> 21:58.234
but apparently,
I'm living in a world of whack-a-mole.

21:58.258 --> 21:59.368
Is everything alright?

21:59.392 --> 22:01.570
Ryan's leaving, and I shouldn't
care, but I kinda do.

22:01.594 --> 22:04.139
But I don't, because what's more
important is I'm helping Vic.

22:04.163 --> 22:06.542
Except I'm not because she's
sneaking out of my apartment,

22:06.566 --> 22:08.577
leaving me with Maya, who
I can't even talk to right now.

22:08.601 --> 22:10.546
And... And then I get stuck
with the guy who keeps dying.

22:10.570 --> 22:13.482
Yeah. And someone I really
looked up to did die, and...

22:13.506 --> 22:15.251
You know, through all of it,

22:15.275 --> 22:18.987
all I can hear is
the sound of those damn bells

22:19.011 --> 22:21.056
coming from my dad's room.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.559
I'm 9 years old all over again,

22:24.583 --> 22:28.130
and a-all this stuff is coming
up that I don't know how to...

22:28.154 --> 22:29.364
I don't know how to clamp it down,

22:29.388 --> 22:30.632
I don't know how to make it go away.

22:30.656 --> 22:33.534
One bleeder at a time.

22:33.558 --> 22:34.569
What?

22:34.593 --> 22:37.335
One bleeder at a time.

22:37.359 --> 22:38.774
I-It's something I learned
when I was a surgeon.

22:38.798 --> 22:39.941
When you open a patient up

22:39.965 --> 22:40.976
and everywhere you look,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.978
there's something
bleeding or falling apar...

22:43.002 --> 22:44.785
when it's damage control,

22:45.637 --> 22:50.607
all you can do is tackle
one bleeder at a time.

23:05.256 --> 23:07.134
- Some call, huh?
- Ooh.

23:07.158 --> 23:09.770
I don't think you'd believe me
if I told you.

23:09.794 --> 23:11.471
How's the eulogy going?

23:11.495 --> 23:13.355
It's not.

23:13.798 --> 23:15.409
I think I'm just too close to it.

23:15.433 --> 23:16.743
Nothing sounds right.

23:18.837 --> 23:21.682
Did you speak at your wife's funeral?

23:21.706 --> 23:23.250
Yes, I did.

23:23.274 --> 23:25.242
Or I t... I tried.

23:25.844 --> 23:28.755
Started off okay,
but then I just lost it.

23:28.779 --> 23:30.424
- Mm.
- Barely even remember now.

23:30.448 --> 23:32.165
Um, I think I was...

23:32.782 --> 23:35.628
I was really raw, you know?

23:35.652 --> 23:38.431
Did you speak at your mom's?

23:38.455 --> 23:41.067
I was 9, so I didn't speak.

23:41.091 --> 23:43.303
- I don't think I spoke the whole day.
- Mm.

23:43.327 --> 23:44.845
Barely.

23:45.462 --> 23:48.181
I was raw, too.

23:48.866 --> 23:50.643
Still am.

23:50.667 --> 23:51.677
Yeah.

23:51.701 --> 23:53.935
So, use it.

23:55.712 --> 23:58.775
Be raw if you need to be raw.

24:00.193 --> 24:02.088
Y-You don't have to write a word

24:02.112 --> 24:04.207
or read a word you write.

24:04.231 --> 24:08.535
Just... get up there and talk.

24:09.418 --> 24:10.984
Talk to him.

24:12.821 --> 24:14.499
It doesn't matter,

24:14.524 --> 24:16.135
not when it comes from the heart.

24:22.231 --> 24:24.009
I just hope Vic will be there to hear it.

24:42.319 --> 24:43.428
Any update on Vic?

24:45.354 --> 24:46.398
Afraid not.

24:46.422 --> 24:48.033
She's really not coming?

25:04.706 --> 25:06.418
There's still time...

25:06.442 --> 25:07.852
if you want change your mind,
get dressed.

25:07.876 --> 25:09.977
Nope, I'm good.

25:13.049 --> 25:15.215
I don't think that's true.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.651
How many different ways
do I have to say it?

25:21.342 --> 25:22.552
How many different times?

25:22.690 --> 25:24.433
I'm fine. I'm good.

25:24.638 --> 25:26.152
I'm coping. I don't want to go.

25:26.177 --> 25:30.421
Nobody wants to go to a funeral.

25:30.665 --> 25:31.675
But it is good to go.

25:31.699 --> 25:34.045
It gives you clarity.
It gives you closure.

25:34.069 --> 25:35.980
Yeah, I don't need any of those things.
I already got 'em.

25:36.004 --> 25:37.048
No, you don't.

25:37.072 --> 25:40.043
I just, um... I need you
to back off of me, please.

25:40.258 --> 25:41.419
- You want me to back off?
- Yeah.

25:41.443 --> 25:43.654
You want me to give you some space?

25:43.678 --> 25:46.690
Okay, you've had days of space, Vic,

25:46.714 --> 25:48.426
and you're still...

25:48.450 --> 25:50.226
You are in denial.

25:50.250 --> 25:52.095
You are not coping.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.770
Believe me, I know how hard it is

25:53.794 --> 25:54.897
- to accept what's happened.
- Mm.

25:54.921 --> 25:55.999
You know I do.

25:56.023 --> 25:57.800
But trust me, when you
lose a spouse like that...

25:57.824 --> 25:59.724
No, but I didn't...
I didn't lose a spouse!

26:01.794 --> 26:04.150
We never got married, so I...
You know what? I...

26:04.751 --> 26:07.195
I didn't get to lose a spouse.

26:08.335 --> 26:09.879
I didn't get to experience a marriage.

26:09.903 --> 26:10.880
I was robbed of that.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.871
Instead, I lost someone who...

26:16.416 --> 26:18.373
I lost someone who...

26:18.611 --> 26:22.585
very well may have been
the love of my life.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.816
But he wasn't my husband.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.468
I'm nothing to him.

26:31.043 --> 26:32.820
Officially, on paper, I am nothing.

26:32.845 --> 26:36.792
So... yeah, maybe I don't...

26:36.817 --> 26:39.229
maybe I don't want to accept
that particular truth right now.

26:39.254 --> 26:42.133
But you don't get to pretend
like you know what that's like.

26:42.158 --> 26:43.481
You don't.

26:43.994 --> 26:45.038
You don't know what this is like,

26:45.063 --> 26:46.274
so stop parading around here

26:46.299 --> 26:48.443
talking about me behind my back to...

26:48.468 --> 26:49.845
to anyone else in the station

26:49.870 --> 26:52.749
because I'm not acting
like you want me to act.

26:52.774 --> 26:54.752
I am not you!

26:54.777 --> 26:56.722
Lucas is not Michael!

26:56.747 --> 26:59.059
Okay, your husband died two years ago!

26:59.084 --> 27:00.728
If anybody is in denial right now...

27:00.753 --> 27:01.773
Say it. Do it.

27:01.798 --> 27:02.832
- Just... Don't.
- It's okay.

27:02.857 --> 27:03.967
Say whatever you want to say.

27:03.992 --> 27:05.804
You want to scream at me,
wail on me? I don't care.

27:05.829 --> 27:08.340
Just get all that anger out right now.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.076
Because if you don't,
it will keep bubbling up

27:10.101 --> 27:11.846
and it will come out worse

27:11.871 --> 27:14.416
- in some other way, onto someone else.
- Oh, my God.

27:14.441 --> 27:15.985
- You can't see it right now, Vic...
- Okay.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.822
- ...but even getting mad...
- Just shut u... Shut up!

27:17.847 --> 27:20.977
- ...it's a healthy first step!
- Just shut... shut up!

27:22.567 --> 27:24.314
Just stop talking to me.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.941
And go to the funeral.

27:27.339 --> 27:29.652
Just... Just go.

27:37.519 --> 27:39.255
Excuse me. Are you Victoria Hughes?

27:39.280 --> 27:41.058
What?

27:41.082 --> 27:42.059
I'm sorry, can I... can I help you?

27:42.083 --> 27:45.996
It's... It's probably weird that I, uh...

27:46.020 --> 27:48.098
Dr. Bailey told me what you look like...

27:48.122 --> 27:50.934
And I'm so sorry for your loss.

27:50.958 --> 27:52.867
I'm s... Who... Who are you?

27:52.867 --> 27:55.279
I'm Levi. I'm a-a doctor at Grey-Sloan.

27:55.303 --> 27:58.520
I was, uh, with Chief Ripley
when he collapsed.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.308
We were both
at the flower shop that day...

28:00.332 --> 28:02.172
the day that he was going to see you.

28:02.196 --> 28:04.702
And I wanted to give these to you.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.856
They're the same ones that he picked out.

28:07.248 --> 28:11.050
N-Not the same same, but, uh... anyway.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.632
He wanted them to say...

28:15.890 --> 28:18.535
he was ready to spend
the rest of his life with you.

28:19.536 --> 28:22.080
So, I guess I...

28:23.163 --> 28:25.831
I thought that
you might like to see them.

28:33.541 --> 28:34.675
Thank you.

28:34.699 --> 28:37.020
Uh, I-I, um...

28:37.044 --> 28:38.589
I really need
to get back to the hospital,

28:38.613 --> 28:40.357
but it was really nice to meet you.

28:40.381 --> 28:42.559
And I-I'm really sorry.

29:12.211 --> 29:15.024
Hey, hey. Hey.

29:32.731 --> 29:34.510
My badge. Where's my badge?

29:34.534 --> 29:36.333
Hey, hey.

29:37.836 --> 29:39.515
One bleeder at a time.

30:50.975 --> 30:53.454
I have to go meet the procession.

30:53.478 --> 30:55.423
You gonna be okay?

30:55.447 --> 30:56.857
Go.

30:56.881 --> 30:58.326
He hated being late.

31:00.747 --> 31:02.330
I'm fine, Robert.

31:02.354 --> 31:03.797
Really.

31:03.821 --> 31:06.299
- Alright.
- Okay.

31:14.031 --> 31:15.609
May I join you?

31:15.633 --> 31:17.977
God, Vic.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.912
I am so glad you're here.

31:40.557 --> 31:42.067
Dean says I'm a sea anemone...

31:42.091 --> 31:43.068
What?

31:43.092 --> 31:44.370
...which I think just means

31:44.394 --> 31:46.372
I keep things in to protect myself,

31:46.396 --> 31:48.494
even when I don't need to.

31:50.233 --> 31:52.166
I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you about Jack.

31:53.593 --> 31:54.647
You tell me everything.

31:54.671 --> 31:57.216
I should've trusted you with my...

31:57.240 --> 31:59.017
poisonous anemone tentacles.

32:01.608 --> 32:03.468
I know funerals are hard for you.

32:04.113 --> 32:05.345
How you holding up?

32:06.482 --> 32:07.981
Better now.

32:30.038 --> 32:31.662
You made it.

32:32.274 --> 32:33.524
I did.

32:49.523 --> 32:51.167
Stay.

33:01.168 --> 33:05.382
And if, while on duty,
I must answer death's call,

33:05.406 --> 33:10.709
bless with your protecting hand
my family, one and all.

33:23.657 --> 33:27.224
I have been thinking a lot
about what to say today.

33:29.362 --> 33:33.542
Chief Ripley was a boss
to most of us in this room.

33:33.566 --> 33:36.145
We looked up to him. We respected him.

33:36.169 --> 33:40.249
As Chief, he gave
everything to this department.

33:40.273 --> 33:46.277
As Lucas, he gave even more
to those he loved outside it.

34:03.261 --> 34:05.256
To me, Lucas was a true friend.

34:06.119 --> 34:07.296
We really saw each other.

34:07.321 --> 34:10.199
We understood each other.

34:10.469 --> 34:12.313
Strengths and flaws.

34:12.338 --> 34:13.681
We fought.

34:13.706 --> 34:18.286
We made up... thankfully, not too late.

34:18.310 --> 34:20.554
Sometimes you connect with a person,

34:20.579 --> 34:22.815
and you can't always explain it.

34:23.649 --> 34:28.196
Over distance and time
and impossible obstacles,

34:28.219 --> 34:31.465
you still find a way to each other.

34:31.489 --> 34:38.072
It's so rare to meet someone
who connects with you that way.

34:38.096 --> 34:40.440
Someone who makes you want to
face your fears

34:40.465 --> 34:43.127
head-on, eyes open.

34:45.070 --> 34:49.007
And it's so hard to say goodbye
to them when they go.

34:49.841 --> 34:51.985
My last conversation with Luke,

34:52.010 --> 34:55.223
he told me not to say goodbye to him.

34:55.246 --> 35:00.186
Instead, I said, "We're good."

35:00.571 --> 35:02.448
I want to reiterate that now.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.403
We miss you, Luke.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.199
We wish you didn't leave us so soon.

35:14.465 --> 35:18.912
But since you did, since you had to...

35:22.139 --> 35:23.706
...it's all good.

35:25.476 --> 35:27.320
We're all good.

35:30.548 --> 35:32.325
You were so good.

36:00.710 --> 36:02.355
When a firefighter dies,

36:02.379 --> 36:06.026
the toll of the bell
represents their last alarm.

36:06.050 --> 36:07.670
The end of their duties.

36:09.226 --> 36:12.675
The bell rings to say
their shift is over.

36:13.596 --> 36:15.696
They are going home.

36:47.933 --> 36:51.247
I first met Ripley on his, uh,
second call as a rookie.

36:51.271 --> 36:54.688
Told him to grab that
"left-handed halligan."

36:55.747 --> 36:57.591
Fire must've been out
for at least 30 minutes

36:57.615 --> 36:59.393
before he realized that it didn't exist.

36:59.417 --> 37:00.928
Oh.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.797
To Chief Ripley.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.954
- To Chief Ripley.
- To Ripley.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.900
- Yes!
- No way.

37:06.924 --> 37:08.969
- Come on.
- That's right. That's right.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.504
College was not a waste.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.239
It's all in the elbow, Dean.
It's all in the elbow.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.607
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:13.631 --> 37:14.842
What am I seeing here?

37:14.866 --> 37:16.477
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

37:16.501 --> 37:18.679
You never go out in public
without that thing on.

37:18.703 --> 37:21.982
And you definitely do not go out
drinking without that thing on!

37:22.006 --> 37:24.784
I do now. I do tonight.

37:24.808 --> 37:26.153
You know, we don't know
what's gonna happen.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.821
I'm alive. I'm here.

37:27.845 --> 37:29.622
World's full of possibilities.

37:29.646 --> 37:31.992
I think that calls for another round.

37:32.016 --> 37:33.626
Uh, guys, how weird would it be

37:33.650 --> 37:35.462
if I accidentally scheduled
my first date with Nikki

37:35.486 --> 37:36.830
for, let's say, right now?

37:36.854 --> 37:38.498
That seems like a terrible idea.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.367
How do you accidentally schedule a date?

37:40.391 --> 37:41.623
Hey!

37:42.526 --> 37:44.004
Hey.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.906
Oh. Hi.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.941
Hello.

37:47.965 --> 37:49.809
- Everyone, this is Nikki.
- Nice to meet you.

37:49.833 --> 37:51.879
Well, this isn't intimidating at all.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.081
Oh, there's nothing to be intimidated by.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.381
Except for my quarters game.

37:55.405 --> 37:56.983
Are you in?

37:57.007 --> 37:59.018
I spent three years at Harvard,

37:59.042 --> 38:01.487
- in which I graduated summa cum laude...
- Mm-hmm.

38:01.511 --> 38:03.811
...broke the women's
tennis record, and...

38:05.949 --> 38:07.493
...became unbeatable at quarters.

38:08.885 --> 38:10.662
Let's get a drink.

38:10.686 --> 38:12.331
Maybe not at a wake.

38:12.355 --> 38:13.966
Let's. Lovely to meet you all.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.002
Nice to meet you.

38:16.026 --> 38:17.758
Yeah, I like her.

38:19.296 --> 38:21.554
Your eulogy was really moving.

38:22.299 --> 38:25.732
Really? I felt, uh, zoned out there.

38:25.756 --> 38:26.913
You spoke from your heart.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.644
It showed.

38:30.105 --> 38:31.683
You're alright.

38:35.545 --> 38:36.755
Thanks.

38:37.780 --> 38:41.126
So, um, if Jack wants
to come over tonight...

38:41.150 --> 38:42.895
I'm okay with it,

38:42.919 --> 38:45.686
if he promises to pick up
breakfast in the morning.

38:47.189 --> 38:49.034
Thanks. I mean it.

38:49.058 --> 38:50.101
Mm.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.570
But I think Vic should
be the only one staying over

38:51.594 --> 38:53.038
for a while.

38:53.062 --> 38:55.240
Yeah.

38:55.264 --> 38:56.408
I think that's good.

38:56.432 --> 38:58.009
Do you know where she is?

38:58.033 --> 38:59.377
I haven't seen her.

38:59.401 --> 39:02.636
She... She said she wanted to be alone.

39:07.141 --> 39:08.653
Oh, those are beautiful flowers.

39:08.677 --> 39:09.687
Thank you.

39:09.711 --> 39:10.936
Uh, just you again?

39:11.947 --> 39:13.012
Yeah.

39:15.116 --> 39:17.127
When a firefighter dies,

39:17.151 --> 39:19.997
the toll of the bell
represents their last alarm.

39:20.021 --> 39:20.965
So, did I tell you

39:20.989 --> 39:22.600
the crazy thing Ryan said

39:22.624 --> 39:25.503
about me and Sullivan, of all people?

39:25.527 --> 39:28.806
He said he thought we were together

39:28.830 --> 39:31.442
because of something he saw at
the hospital or something.

39:31.466 --> 39:33.250
Yeah, I saw that, too.

39:33.935 --> 39:35.947
That wasn't anything.

39:35.971 --> 39:38.782
We're not... I mean,
I'm... I'm definitely not...

39:38.806 --> 39:40.249
No?

39:40.273 --> 39:42.486
- No.
- Mm.

39:44.277 --> 39:46.055
You sure about that?

39:48.983 --> 39:50.159
Once the bell rings...

39:52.319 --> 39:53.830
...it can't be un-rung.

39:53.854 --> 39:56.165
- Just my usual, please.
- Got it.

39:56.189 --> 39:58.768
Um, just so you know,
I'm about to take off.

39:58.792 --> 40:00.604
Phil will be taking over for me.

40:00.628 --> 40:02.506
So if you need anything else

40:02.530 --> 40:04.474
or your husband's coming later,

40:04.498 --> 40:06.342
I could go ahead and
put an order in now for you.

40:06.366 --> 40:08.077
- Just let me know.
- Okay, thanks, Cam.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.078
You're welcome.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.847
There's no more denying it.

40:10.871 --> 40:13.282
The end is here.

40:13.306 --> 40:15.418
Okay.

40:15.442 --> 40:17.553
I'm calling it. Let's get you home.

40:17.577 --> 40:19.222
- But it's so early.
- Hey. Two more of these.

40:19.246 --> 40:20.623
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no. None for me.

40:20.647 --> 40:22.125
I-I got to get home to Miranda, you know?

40:22.149 --> 40:24.360
I can give you a ride or call you one.

40:24.384 --> 40:25.461
I don't know.

40:25.485 --> 40:28.197
I've got, uh, some mistakes
to make tonight, Warren.

40:28.221 --> 40:29.999
- Yeah.
- But, uh, I'll get a cab.

40:30.023 --> 40:31.034
Don't worry. Go home.

40:33.193 --> 40:34.270
- Alright.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:36.163 --> 40:37.523
See you later.

40:37.926 --> 40:39.075
I'll take a beer.

40:43.403 --> 40:45.080
How's it going?

40:45.104 --> 40:46.481
I'm Jeremy.

40:46.505 --> 40:48.016
I'm Travis.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.284
I know.

40:49.308 --> 40:50.485
You do?

40:50.509 --> 40:51.770
Yeah, you're the one who's friends

40:51.794 --> 40:54.022
with Ripley's little side hustle...

40:54.046 --> 40:55.323
Hughes, right?

40:55.347 --> 40:59.027
She looked wrecked at that ceremony.

40:59.051 --> 41:00.128
Come on, man.

41:00.152 --> 41:02.097
Give me the scoop.

41:02.121 --> 41:03.965
You need to stop talking right now.

41:03.989 --> 41:06.428
Oh, don't tell me you're
getting a piece of that, too.

41:06.453 --> 41:07.969
Whoa, whoa!

41:07.993 --> 41:10.972
The bell rings to say the shift is over.

41:12.864 --> 41:14.176
Hey, uh, Cam?

41:14.200 --> 41:16.178
Oh. Need something else?

41:19.770 --> 41:23.306
You know the, uh... the guy
I'm always in here with?

41:25.443 --> 41:27.489
He's not my husband.

41:28.699 --> 41:31.024
And I, uh...

41:31.048 --> 41:35.629
I lied to you before
when you asked where he was.

41:35.653 --> 41:37.231
He wasn't at work.

41:40.391 --> 41:44.905
He wasn't a-at work...

41:46.631 --> 41:49.009
...because he died.

41:56.773 --> 41:58.784
That's, um...

42:00.477 --> 42:02.021
That... That sucks.

42:02.045 --> 42:04.257
The bell rings to say goodbye.

42:07.018 --> 42:08.461
Yeah, it super does.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.330
The bell rings to say...

42:11.921 --> 42:14.370
...it's time to go home.
