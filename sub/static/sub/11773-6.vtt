WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:08.533
( theme music playing )

00:21.667 --> 00:25.300
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.700
THIS IS
THE SLOWEST TOASTER.

00:27.733 --> 00:30.900
MAN, OH, MAN.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

00:30.933 --> 00:33.000
CHEAP-ASS TOASTER,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.533
- HEY, DO YOU WANT
TO GET THIS JOB TODAY?

00:36.567 --> 00:39.400

A LITTLE TIP, HUH?

00:39.433 --> 00:42.433
YOU'RE GONNA GO IN.
HE'LL BE UP HERE, OKAY?

00:42.467 --> 00:45.333
YOU'RE DOWN HERE, RIGHT?
HE'S ON TOP.

00:45.367 --> 00:48.300
- HE'S ASKING YOU
THE QUESTIONS.
- UH-HUH.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.033
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
THE INTERVIEW STARTS.
HE ASKS SOME QUESTIONS,

00:50.067 --> 00:52.567
YOU ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
THEN YOU START ASKING HIM
THE QUESTIONS,

00:52.600 --> 00:55.067
AND YOU FLIP IT.
NOW HE'S TRYING
TO IMPRESS YOU.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.367
- TURN THAT SHIT
AROUND ON HIM.
- TURN IT AROUND ON HIM.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.400
- TOPSY-TURVY
THAT MOTHERFUCKER.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.900
WHY YOU GOT
NO CREDIT CARDS? YOU GOT
NO CREDIT CARDS AT ALL?

01:01.933 --> 01:04.167
- WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A CREDIT CARD, SIR?
- YOU HAVE NO CREDIT CARDS?

01:04.200 --> 01:07.567
WHY DO YOU ORDER
THESE CDs OUT OF
THOSE MAGAZINES

01:07.600 --> 01:09.533
AND BE SENDING 'EM
NEXT DOOR TO THE NEIGHBOR

01:09.567 --> 01:11.067
AND THEN WHEN
THE UPS GUY COMES,

01:11.100 --> 01:12.733
YOU PICK 'EM UP LIKE
YOU LIVE THERE AND SHIT?

01:12.767 --> 01:16.200
YOU KEEP ORDERING CDs
THAT YOU DON'T PAY FOR?

01:16.233 --> 01:19.167
I'M JUST SAYING--
EXAMPLE HOW TO TURN
THAT SHIT AROUND.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
SPECIFIC SHIT, THOUGH.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.600
I DON'T KNOW. IT MIGHT
NOT BE SUCH A GOOD IDEA,
THIS WHOLE FLIP-IT THING.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.933
- I LIKE IT, MAN.

01:25.967 --> 01:28.733

01:47.367 --> 01:50.500

02:08.467 --> 02:11.167

02:11.200 --> 02:13.433

02:13.467 --> 02:15.600
NO NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.867
I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DRINK.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.067

02:29.100 --> 02:31.467

THIS WAY?
- NO, I'M--

02:31.500 --> 02:34.300
PLEASE, IF YOU WOULD JUST

MAYBE I'M GETTING SICK.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.167
TOUCH MY HEAD.
AM I SICK?

02:44.200 --> 02:48.067
YOU DON'T HAVE
A FEVER.

02:48.067 --> 02:51.067
- HEY, GUESS WHAT.

03:03.567 --> 03:06.133
- THEY'RE OUT.

I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GO

03:06.167 --> 03:08.600

03:08.633 --> 03:11.167
YOU-- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE
OR SOMETHING.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.667
REALLY? I WANNA
TAKE YOU, HONEY. I DON'T
WANNA TAKE ANYBODY ELSE.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.700
NO, I CAN'T GO OUT THERE

03:15.733 --> 03:18.900
- I WANNA TAKE YOU.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.367
WANNA TAKE YOU.

03:23.733 --> 03:26.967
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
NOT COMING ON TO ME.

03:27.067 --> 03:29.400
NO GOOD?

03:29.433 --> 03:31.933
IF YOU COULD JUST
GET ME SOME WATER
AND SOME JUICE,

03:31.967 --> 03:33.867
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.867

HEY!

03:50.933 --> 03:53.767

- YEAH, THAT'S GREAT. GREAT.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.967
HOW ABOUT,
"PHEW, IT STINKS"?

04:20.067 --> 04:21.700
I KNOW A LOT MORE, TOO.

04:21.733 --> 04:24.200
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR TOASTER?

04:24.233 --> 04:25.733
YOU HAPPY
WITH YOUR TOASTER?

04:25.767 --> 04:27.767
Susie:
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.633
- IT TAKES FOREVER.
IT'S SO SLOW.
- OH, IT'S SLOW.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.800
Susie:
OH, THERE'S A SALE.

04:32.833 --> 04:36.100
SUR LA TABLE.
SUR LA TABLE'S HAVING
A SALE ON TOASTERS.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.833
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO SAY "SUR LA TABLE"?
- SHE SPELLED IT, LARRY.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.633
- SHE SPELLED IT.
- YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.300
YEAH, THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS ABOUT ME
YOU DON'T KNOW.

04:42.333 --> 04:45.233
- HELLO, SWEETHEART.

04:45.267 --> 04:47.367
- YEAH. HI, SAMMIE.
- HI.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.267
AH! SPIDER! SPIDER!

04:49.300 --> 04:51.500
- Sammie: OH MY GOD!
- SPIDER! AGHH!

04:51.533 --> 04:54.067
- COME ON!
- LARRY, WHAT IS
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

04:54.067 --> 04:56.233
- KILLING A LIVE CREATURE!
- WHAT?

04:56.267 --> 04:58.867
Susie: WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU? YOU'RE
TRAUMATIZING THESE KIDS!

04:58.900 --> 05:01.800
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? IT'S A SPIDER.
- IT'S A LIVING CREATURE, LARRY.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.067
OH, LIVING CREATURE!
DO YOU WANT THAT LIVING CREATURE
CRAWLING UP YOUR LEG?

05:04.100 --> 05:05.967
THESE KIDS DON'T NEED
TO SEE THAT KIND
OF VIOLENCE.

05:06.067 --> 05:08.533
IT'S A LITTLE SPIDER.
BIG DEAL.

05:08.567 --> 05:11.900
- ARE YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?
- OH MY GOD. IS THAT YOUR DOG?

05:11.933 --> 05:14.400
I THOUGHT IT WAS, LIKE,
HALF RAT OR SOMETHING.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.533
SAID IT'S A RAT.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.733
YOU KNOW, LIKE IT LOOKS--
NO, IT'S-- IT'S A JOKE.

05:20.767 --> 05:23.467
I WAS JOKING!

05:23.500 --> 05:25.400
JOKING!

05:25.433 --> 05:28.067
- YOU INSULTED HER NOW, OKAY?
SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU SCREAMING.
- WHAT DID YOU--

05:28.067 --> 05:31.300
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.
I SAID YOU SAID
IT WAS HALF-RAT.

05:31.333 --> 05:34.067
HOW DO YOU WIND UP
WITH A DOG LIKE THAT?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.967
MMM!

05:41.233 --> 05:43.700
- OH, HEY, HAL.
- HEY, HOW YOU DOING, LARRY?

05:43.733 --> 05:46.367
GOOD, DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
I-I'M GLAD I SAW YOU AGAIN,

05:46.400 --> 05:48.333
BECAUSE AFTER YOU LEFT,

05:48.367 --> 05:50.133
I MADE A LITTLE COMMENT

05:50.167 --> 05:52.667
THAT MAYBE DIDN'T GO OVER
SO WELL WITH YOUR WIFE.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.167
I SAID HER DOG LOOKED,

05:55.200 --> 05:56.800
YOU KNOW, HALF-RAT.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.633
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.733
- I WAS JOKING
IN MY TONE.
- MM-HMM.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.633
I HAD A JOKING TONE,

06:02.667 --> 06:05.967
BUT I GUESS BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, SHE DOESN'T HEAR,

06:06.067 --> 06:08.367
SHE'S NOT ABLE
TO DETECT TONE.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.233
- NO.
- YOU KNOW, THE DOG.

06:10.267 --> 06:13.167
IT IS KIND OF
A RATTY-LOOKING DOG.
YOU'VE GOTTA ADMIT THAT.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.667
- SHE LOVES THAT DOG.
- HOW ABOUT YOU?

06:15.700 --> 06:18.167
- DO YOU PET THAT DOG?
- YEAH, I PET--

06:18.200 --> 06:20.800
- YOU PET THAT DOG?
YOU PET THAT DOG?
- I PET THAT DOG.

06:20.833 --> 06:23.233
I PET THAT DOG, YES.

06:23.267 --> 06:26.900
ANYWAY, JUST DO ME A FAVOR
AND TELL HER I WAS JOKING.

06:26.933 --> 06:29.867
- I'M SORRY.
- WELL, I THINK YOU
SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.800
WELL, I WOULD,

06:31.833 --> 06:34.933
EXCEPT I CAN'T
REALLY CALL HER.

06:34.967 --> 06:36.433
THE DEAF THING AGAIN.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.433
I KNOW SHE'S DEAF.

06:38.467 --> 06:40.733
YEAH. YEAH, OF COURSE.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.200
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER
AND JUST APOLOGIZE
FACE TO FACE,

06:43.233 --> 06:45.567
SO SHE CAN ACTUALLY
SEE IT COMING OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH?

06:45.600 --> 06:48.333
YOU WANT ME TO COME BY,
MAKE A SPECIAL TRIP?

06:48.367 --> 06:50.333
I WOULDN'T THINK
SHE WOULD WANT THAT.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.933
I WOULD THINK THAT
THEY WANNA BE TREATED
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

06:52.967 --> 06:55.767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "THEY"?
- WELL, DEAF PEOPLE,

06:55.800 --> 06:59.200
'CAUSE THEY'RE
THE ONLY ONES WHO NEED
A SPECIAL POP-IN APOLOGY.

06:59.233 --> 07:02.300
EVERY OTHER KIND OF
HANDICAPPED PERSON YOU CAN
APOLOGIZE TO ON THE PHONE.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.467
DEAF PEOPLE
REQUIRE THAT YOU
GO TO THEIR HOUSE.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.100
RIGHT.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.900
I WOULDN'T THINK
THEY WOULD WANT THAT.
THAT'S ALL.

07:08.933 --> 07:11.967
I STILL WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU WOULD COME BY
AND APOLOGIZE TO HER.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.600
SHE REALLY
LOVES THAT DOG.

07:13.633 --> 07:17.400
THAT DOG SITS
IN YOUR LAP WHILE
YOU'RE WATCHING TV?

07:17.433 --> 07:19.500
YEAH.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.733
OKAY, I'M MORE
THAN HAPPY TO COME BY.

07:21.767 --> 07:24.300
- ( machine whirring )
- Hal: THANKS.

07:29.733 --> 07:31.833
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?

07:33.567 --> 07:35.367
FUCK YOU!

07:36.633 --> 07:38.633
WHAT? WHAT?

07:45.167 --> 07:46.967
Larry:
CHERYL WAS IN BED.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.300
SHE HAD
A LITTLE TEMPERATURE,

07:49.333 --> 07:53.067
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT IT
THAT KIND OF TURNED ME ON.
SHE'S SICK.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.833
- I UNDERSTAND.
- SHE'S HELPLESS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

07:55.867 --> 07:58.433
I LIKE IT THE REVERSE,
WHEN I'M SICK.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.333
YEAH, I LIKE IT
EITHER WAY.

08:00.367 --> 08:04.367
- I GUESS I JUST LIKE
SICK SEX.
- YEAH!

08:04.400 --> 08:07.100
- IT'S ALL GOOD.
IT'S GOOD, ALL RIGHT?
- OKAY.

08:07.133 --> 08:09.967
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
SO LET ME ASK YOU
THIS QUESTION.

08:10.067 --> 08:13.800
- YOU KNOW MY FATHER'S BEEN
KIND OF DEPRESSED LATELY.
- YEAH. YEAH.

08:13.833 --> 08:17.300
SO I'M THINKING MAYBE
ACTUALLY GETTING HIM
ONE OF THOSE,

08:17.333 --> 08:21.067
YOU KNOW, THE MASSAGES,
THE HAPPY-ENDING KIND.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.933
- HAPPY ENDING.
I AM THE GUY.
- MASSAGE.

08:23.967 --> 08:26.300
- REALLY, YEAH?
- YOU WANT SOME NAMES?

08:26.333 --> 08:29.633
- ANYBODY.
- WELL, I GOT SOME GREAT ONES,
AND THEY GIVE GREAT MASSAGES.

08:29.667 --> 08:32.500
SO HE THINKS
HE'S GETTING A MASSAGE.
HE'S GONNA FREAK OUT, MAN.

08:32.533 --> 08:34.100
I KNOW THE PERFECT GIRL.
HER NAME'S LISA.

08:34.133 --> 08:36.900
- LISA.
- LISA, SHE WILL
TREAT HIM LIKE A KING.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.600
SHE'S THE BEST GIRL
YOU COULD POSSIBLY
GET FOR THIS.

08:39.633 --> 08:42.967
- BEST GIRL FOR WHAT?
- WHAT'S THE GIRL
WHO CLEANS ON TUESDAY?

08:43.067 --> 08:45.100
- WHAT'S HER NAME AGAIN?
- OH, ROSALINA.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.067
- ROSALINA.
- SHE'S TERRIFIC.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.467
- YOU'VE GOT HER NUMBER.
YOU'LL GIVE IT TO HIM.
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.433
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT.
- WHAT?

08:51.467 --> 08:54.667
I NEED TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION ABOUT
SIGN LANGUAGE.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.200
- I WAS IN THE MEN'S ROOM
EARLIER WITH HAL...
- Susie: MM-HMM.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.667
- OKAY.
- ...AND I WAS
DRYING MY HANDS,

09:00.700 --> 09:03.533
AND I MUST HAVE
SIGNED SOMETHING
INADVERTENTLY,

09:03.567 --> 09:06.067
BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE GOT PISSED OFF,
SAID, "FUCK YOU,"

09:06.100 --> 09:09.233
- AND STORMED OUT.
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO?
RE-ENACT.

09:09.267 --> 09:11.500
I WAS DRYING MY HANDS,
YOU KNOW,

09:11.533 --> 09:15.067
AND THEN I REMEMBER
SCRATCHING MY FINGER

09:15.067 --> 09:18.500
- LIKE THIS.
- Susie: OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

09:18.533 --> 09:21.100
LARRY, THIS MEANS
"COCKSUCKER."

09:21.133 --> 09:24.067
YOU CALLED HIM
A COCKSUCKER.
THINK ABOUT IT.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.433
YOU CALLED HIM A COCKSUCKER?

09:26.467 --> 09:28.567
- YOU CALLED HIM A COCKSUCKER.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.300
Susie: HE THOUGHT
YOU SAID COCKSUCKER.
YES, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

09:30.333 --> 09:33.733
YOU CALLED HAL,
ONE OF THE SWEETEST GUYS
IN THE WORLD, A COCKSUCKER.

09:33.767 --> 09:36.067
HE SAID, "FUCK YOU,"
AND WALKED OUT?
GOOD FOR HIM.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.533
- HA!
- UNBELIEVABLE.

09:38.567 --> 09:41.433
MEANWHILE, I GOT
NOBODY TO TAKE TO SEE
"GREASE" TOMORROW.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.467
- OH, CHERYL'S SICK.
- SHE'S SICK, YEAH.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.800
- SHE'S NOT EVEN GOING.

TO GO WITH.

09:45.833 --> 09:48.100
Jeff: WHO WATCHES "GREASE"
BY THEMSELVES? YOU GOTTA
GO WITH SOMEBODY.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.767
- I HAVE NOBODY TO TAKE.
- I'LL GO.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.367
I'LL GO TO "GREASE"
WITH YOU.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.833
THAT'S MIKE.
HE'S MY EXTERMINATOR.

09:58.867 --> 10:02.367
HOW YOU DOING?
I HEARD YOU SAY
YOU GOT AN EXTRA TICKET.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.567

WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A MIDDLE-SCHOOL
PRODUCTION--

10:08.100 --> 10:10.367
KIDS DOING "GREASE."
YOU DON'T WANNA
GO SEE THAT.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.033
I'D LOVE IT.
I'D LOVE TO GO.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.967
WELL, YOU KNOW,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.367

10:24.667 --> 10:26.167
WHAT? YOU GET WHAT?

10:26.200 --> 10:28.233
I SHOULDN'T HAVE

10:28.267 --> 10:30.167
MR. GREENE,
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'LL FINISH UP.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.600
NO, THAT'S CRAZY.
NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.867
I JUST OVERHEARD THAT
YOU HAD AN EXTRA TICKET,

10:34.900 --> 10:38.033
AND I LOVE "GREASE,"

THAT'S GONNA BE FUN.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.667
THAT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
SHOULD I PICK YOU UP?

10:48.700 --> 10:51.367
SURE, PICK ME UP.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.767
HEY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.700
- HUH?

CONVERSATION OVER.

11:17.733 --> 11:19.600
SO YOU WERE
INTERVIEWING HIM

11:19.633 --> 11:21.800
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

11:21.833 --> 11:25.067
YEAH, I THINK I GOT IT.
I'M FLIPPING ASS RIGHT NOW.
I'M OUT OF CONTROL RIGHT NOW.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.567
- DON'T FLIP ME, MAN.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW IF I HAVEN'T
ALREADY FLIPPED YOUR ASS?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.067
- I'M UNFLIPPABLE.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

11:29.100 --> 11:31.133
- ONLY WOMEN CAN FLIP ME.
- I'LL FLIP YOU, LARRY.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.933
WORDS TO THE WISE, LARRY:

11:32.967 --> 11:36.433
THIS TOASTER
AIN'T WORTH A DAMN.
FLIPPING TOASTER.

YOU KNOW,

11:52.700 --> 11:55.733
YOU'LL THINK ABOUT
GETTING YOUR OWN--
YOUR OWN PLACE.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.433

YOU KNOW,
EVEN IF ONE OF YOU
ACTUALLY GOT A JOB,

12:04.700 --> 12:07.767
