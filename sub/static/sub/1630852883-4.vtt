It's almost time
for 4:30 spin class!

00:34.242 --> 00:35.994
A pool kid.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.120
In the creek?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.207
Sewer Queen?!

00:41.291 --> 00:42.792
Are you
on the swim tea-- ah!

00:45.503 --> 00:46.755
Huh?

00:46.755 --> 00:50.258
I love spin class!

00:52.719 --> 00:54.512
W-What is that?

00:58.558 --> 00:59.976
It is I, Frizboy,

00:59.976 --> 01:01.811
and I've been sent here
on behalf of --

01:01.895 --> 01:02.937
Oh!

01:03.021 --> 01:04.355
Guh, I'm just here to say

01:04.439 --> 01:06.316
that the ruler of the drains
has summoned Craig

01:06.316 --> 01:07.734
to come see her immediately.

01:07.734 --> 01:11.905
Well, when Her Majesty calls,
the Stump Kids answer!

01:11.905 --> 01:13.531
Not you, grass walker!

01:13.615 --> 01:16.367
The Sewer Queen only
summoned the map maker.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.577
Sorry, guys.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.413
I-I'll spin back
before you know it.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.248
What was that about?

01:22.332 --> 01:25.418
My queen,
I have brought the map maker.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.461
Thank you, Frizboy.

01:27.921 --> 01:32.008
Everyone, I wish to have
a private audience with Craig.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.178
Yeah, you heard Her Majesty!
Leave us be!

01:35.178 --> 01:37.764
You too, Frizboy.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.599
Oh. Okay.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.520
So, Craig...

01:43.520 --> 01:46.064
You know my dark secret.

01:46.064 --> 01:50.860
I am indeed
a Herkleton Horseshoe Crab.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.654
You're on the swim team?
That's cool!

01:52.654 --> 01:54.656
No!
It's not cool!

01:54.656 --> 01:55.740
I hate it!

01:55.824 --> 01:57.075
My mom said that
I should sign up

01:57.075 --> 01:59.619
for some
extracurricular activity,

01:59.619 --> 02:04.374
so I chose swimming because of
my love for all that is aquatic.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.460
But swimming is
an individual sport,

02:07.544 --> 02:09.921
and I'd rather spend my time
in the sewers

02:09.921 --> 02:12.298
where I can swim freely
and help people,

02:12.382 --> 02:14.509
instead of being confined
to lane 6,

02:14.509 --> 02:18.346
practicing the same flip turn
over and over and over!

02:18.346 --> 02:23.017
So, while I leave my house
dressed in my swim gear,

02:23.101 --> 02:26.271
I've been ditching practice
to spend time in the creek.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.524
Why don't you just tell your mom
you're unhappy at swim team?

02:29.524 --> 02:32.235
I promised my mom
I would stick with it.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.987
She likes that I keep
my commitments.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.323
I can't let her know that
I've gone back on my word.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.117
But she's gonna find out
sooner or later

02:39.117 --> 02:40.660
that you've been
skipping out.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.122
Not if <i>you</i> tell her
I've been coming to practice.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.748
<i>Excusez-moi?</i>

02:45.832 --> 02:47.625
If you come over tonight

02:47.709 --> 02:50.461
and pretended to be
a fellow Horseshoe Crab...

02:50.545 --> 02:52.714
But why me?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.592
You're the only one
that knows my secret, Craig.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.969
The rest of the kingdom
would never accept

02:57.969 --> 02:59.804
their queen
mingling with,

02:59.888 --> 03:02.724
dare I say, pool kids.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.934
Okay. I'll try.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.437
But I should warn you,
I'm not a good liar.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.648
Craig, a queen would never
ask you to lie.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.693
I'm asking you to...
pretend!

03:13.693 --> 03:16.279
Oh! Well, heh,
I'm real good at pretending.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.739
Excellent!

03:17.739 --> 03:20.408
Come to my place as soon
as the dinner horn blows.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.330
Something doesn't smell right
about this.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.999
And I don't mean
the sewer.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.631
Uhh...hello?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.132
Salutations!

03:36.132 --> 03:40.136
I'm Craig, and I'm friends
with the Sewe-uhhhhhhhh...

03:40.136 --> 03:42.555
Whoa!
Oh, hey, Craig!

03:42.639 --> 03:44.807
Nice of you to come by
after practice.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.559
Heh heh!
Check it out, Mom!

03:46.643 --> 03:48.311
It's us,
the Horseshoe Crabs --

03:48.311 --> 03:51.314
<i>Eileen</i>
and Craig.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.148
Woop-woop!

03:52.148 --> 03:53.441
Heh heh.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.402
Okay, well, take off your shoes
and come on in.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.821
Hurry up -- the flies!
Have you eaten yet?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.156
Phew!

04:00.156 --> 04:03.952
What's Craig doing
at the Sewer Queen's house?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.954
Having dinner?

04:05.954 --> 04:07.622
Why would he do that?

04:07.622 --> 04:10.333
Unless... Craig wants to know

04:10.333 --> 04:12.794
what it's like to be royalty
and has asked for

04:12.794 --> 04:15.672
the Sewer Queen's webbed foot
in marriage!

04:15.672 --> 04:18.341
Craig is getting married
without us.

04:18.341 --> 04:22.095
How could he?!
He swore I could officiate!

04:22.095 --> 04:25.098
So far, so good.

04:25.098 --> 04:29.102
Oh, come on, dudes.
The game isn't that scary.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.853
Oh, hey, Ai-Ai.
What's up?

04:30.937 --> 04:32.230
Ate Cristal, this is

04:32.230 --> 04:34.983
my fellow Horseshoe Crab
team member, Craig.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.526
He's staying
for dinner tonight.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.860
Nice, nice.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.238
Hey, Ai-Ai, next time
you're sneaking in my room,

04:40.238 --> 04:42.657
can you put the controllers
back when you're done?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.659
I-I-I didn't!

04:44.659 --> 04:49.330
All right, Craig, I'm gonna
introduce you to my lola.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.915
She only speaks Bisaya.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.042
I don't always understand
exactly what she's saying,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.628
but I do know that
whenever we say hi to her,

04:55.712 --> 04:57.338
we got to do the bless.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.215
Woman: <i>I do...</i>

04:59.215 --> 05:01.050
Man: <i>I...don't!</i>

05:01.134 --> 05:03.386
<i>That woman is a ghost!</i>

05:03.386 --> 05:04.470
Huh!

05:07.724 --> 05:10.059
Hey, Lola.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.146
I brought my teammate Craig
over for dinner!

05:13.146 --> 05:15.565
Hello!
Pleased to meet you.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.032
Wo-o-o-w!

05:24.032 --> 05:25.283
Yes!

05:25.283 --> 05:27.368
<i>guapo.</i>

05:27.452 --> 05:29.120
boyfriend?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.246
Lola!

05:30.246 --> 05:32.707
Craig, let's go help
get dinner ready!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.393
Craig,
you can take this chair.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.687
My dad is working
a little late tonight,

05:54.771 --> 05:56.731
and Tito Junior
is with his friends.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.233
Make sure you save some food
for them when they get home.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.526
Sure, Mom!

06:00.610 --> 06:03.488
Psst, if she starts asking
questions about swim team,

06:03.488 --> 06:05.364
just make something up.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.033
Psst!

06:07.033 --> 06:08.910
You can count on me.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.536
Oh, what's this?

06:10.620 --> 06:15.458
It's called tortang talong.
It's eggplant mixed with eggs.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.834
Wow!
Like an omelet?

06:16.918 --> 06:20.963
Oh, have some of this too!
This is sinigang na isda.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.299
That's Tagalog for, like,
fish stew.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.593
It's a tasty sour soup.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.265
Wow-wow-wow!
So tasty!

06:31.349 --> 06:35.311
So, Craig, you came
from practice, huh?

06:35.311 --> 06:38.356
I thought you were supposed
to wear your team shirt there.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.277
Oh, uh, well I-I don't have
to wear one because...

06:43.361 --> 06:45.154
I'm the coach!
Ha ha!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.155
Coach Craig!

06:48.241 --> 06:50.618
You're the coach?

06:50.618 --> 06:51.702
Yes.

06:51.786 --> 06:52.995
You.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.288
Mm-hmm.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.832
Interesting.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.335
How exactly did a young man
such as yourself

06:59.335 --> 07:02.380
wind up the coach
of the Horseshoe Crabs?

07:02.380 --> 07:03.881
Oh, that's a long story.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.384
But because you're my star
swimmer's mother dearest,

07:06.384 --> 07:07.885
I'll let you in
on my secret.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.847
I was raised by fish...people

07:10.847 --> 07:13.599
in... Atlantis!

07:13.683 --> 07:15.184
The Lost City?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.728
Well, they found it.
In Georgia, I think.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.649
There I trained to be the best
swimmer in the seven seas!

07:21.649 --> 07:23.025
I have a fin, too, but, uh,

07:23.109 --> 07:25.194
I think it's just
a little bit inappropriate

07:25.278 --> 07:26.487
to show it off
at the table.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.160
Mmm! Mm!

07:32.160 --> 07:34.829
I can't believe it.
They believe it, Craig.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.373
Do you see anything?

07:37.373 --> 07:40.710
I see Craig,
I see the Sewer Queen.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.836
And they're smiling!

07:41.836 --> 07:43.421
Well, that proves it!
You're right!

07:43.421 --> 07:46.549
They're getting married,
and they didn't invite us! Ohh!

07:47.967 --> 07:50.219
We got to bust in there
and put a stop to this!

07:50.303 --> 07:52.430
Frizboy: Hold it right there,
dryfooters!

07:52.430 --> 07:55.308
We're here to stop Craig
from recruiting the Sewer Queen

07:55.308 --> 07:56.559
to become a pool kid!

07:56.559 --> 07:58.227
A pool kid?
A pool kid?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.022
Your friend is trying
to steal our queen!

08:01.022 --> 08:03.441
<i>Excusez-moi?!</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:05.109
You got it backwards!

08:05.193 --> 08:08.696
It's obvious your queen is
trying to steal <i>our</i> friend!

08:08.696 --> 08:09.906
Aah!

08:09.906 --> 08:10.907
Attack!

08:12.450 --> 08:14.243
Ahh.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.663
So, Craig, how's Eileen's
butterfly coming along?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.082
Well, we don't allow pets
in practice,

08:20.166 --> 08:21.667
but she's a really
good swimmer.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.296
Hm, maybe even better than me.
Craig the Coach!

08:25.296 --> 08:26.964
Oh, my gosh!

08:27.048 --> 08:28.925
Well, if Craig the Coach
here thinks

08:28.925 --> 08:31.135
that Ai-Ai has been
doing oh-so well,

08:31.219 --> 08:34.096
maybe you should swim on a team
that practices all year 'round!

08:34.180 --> 08:36.057
Uh, M-Mom?

08:36.057 --> 08:39.227
In fact, I just looked up
a swim camp this afternoon

08:39.227 --> 08:42.980
where you basically live
in the pool and swim 24-7!

08:47.026 --> 08:48.152
Coach Craig!

08:48.236 --> 08:50.529
Actually...
that's not a good idea,

08:50.613 --> 08:52.657
'cause I know
that place and...

08:52.657 --> 08:55.952
it's run by...
the Loch Ness Monster!

08:55.952 --> 08:59.121
Oh. I didn't see that
on the website.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.458
Uh...uh...
uhhh...

09:07.964 --> 09:09.757
Stay back, I say!

09:09.757 --> 09:11.842
I will become best man!

09:11.926 --> 09:13.636
Kelsey?
JP?

09:13.636 --> 09:14.804
Uh...

09:14.804 --> 09:17.139
Who are these kids?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.266
Uh...

09:18.266 --> 09:21.227
Stop!

09:21.227 --> 09:25.189
My queen!

09:26.274 --> 09:28.818
Lola:

09:28.818 --> 09:32.488
Eileen?
What is this?

09:32.572 --> 09:35.241
Uhh...uhh...

09:35.241 --> 09:38.995
I-I've been ditching swim
practice to go to the creek.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.454
You've been what?!

09:40.538 --> 09:43.332
I thought I couldn't tell you
because I didn't want you

09:43.416 --> 09:45.126
to think I was a quitter.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.086
I just don't like
swim team.

09:47.086 --> 09:51.340
When I'm there, I feel like
I'm just any other swimmer.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.218
But when I'm at the creek,
I'm a queen!

09:54.302 --> 09:57.179
I help kids in a way
that matters.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.974
Eileen.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.934
If you didn't like being
on the swim team,

10:02.018 --> 10:03.644
you could have told me.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.147
I like it when you stick
to your commitments,

10:06.147 --> 10:09.025
but I'd rather you commit
to something you enjoy.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.360
And if being in the creek
with your friends

10:11.444 --> 10:14.196
is that thing,
then that's great.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.533
I don't want to know you're
doing well at the swim team.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.661
I just want to know
that you're doing well.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.833
I'm sorry for fooling you with
my brilliant deception, ma'am.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.168
Oh, that's okay.

10:27.168 --> 10:31.047
Now, are any of your
royal subjects hungry?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.256
Cristal!

10:32.340 --> 10:35.092
Take out the three-pound packs
of lumpia!

10:35.176 --> 10:36.344
Your Majesty.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.304
Even if you were
one of the pool kids,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.389
we would still accept you
as our queen.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
Thank you, Frizboy.

10:42.725 --> 10:46.562
Ah, another problem
solved by yours truly.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.938
Sorry we crashed your wedding,
Craig.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.732
But, ugh, you should have
invited us.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.233
Craig, I'm not one
to hold a grudge,

10:51.317 --> 10:53.611
but if you renew your vows
and I'm not involved,

10:53.611 --> 10:54.904
there will be a problem.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.406
I -- What did you think
I was doing?

10:57.490 --> 11:02.536
Lola:

11:04.705 --> 11:07.583
♪ When it's time to go to bed ♪

11:07.583 --> 11:12.088
♪ I know
I don't have to feel alone ♪

11:12.088 --> 11:15.424
♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪

11:15.508 --> 11:16.759
♪ At the creek ♪

11:16.759 --> 11:19.387
Just like I drew it.
