WEBVTT

00:09.442 --> 00:10.567
MAN: Hey.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.328
How do you like this? Paradise.

00:16.329 --> 00:18.331
I never want to go home!

00:18.332 --> 00:21.214
David, come on!
It's going to be amazing!

00:21.215 --> 00:23.336
- Are you ready for your surprise?
DAVID: Yes.

00:23.337 --> 00:26.580
OK, surprise!

00:26.581 --> 00:28.501
<i>- You like it?
- I love him.</i>

00:28.502 --> 00:30.223
<i>-  I love you.
- Mat?</i>

00:30.224 --> 00:33.907
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

00:33.908 --> 00:36.790
The last ten days on this island
with you have...

00:36.791 --> 00:40.635
Have been the best! I can't remember
ever feeling this happy.

00:40.636 --> 00:43.117
So why do all good things have to end?

00:43.118 --> 00:44.759
<i>Who says it has to end?</i>

00:44.760 --> 00:49.445
<i>Mia, I don't know you but I think I want
to spend the rest of my life trying to.</i>

00:52.127 --> 00:54.650
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

00:54.651 --> 00:56.016
Yes.

00:57.693 --> 01:00.176
Wait till you meet my family.

01:00.177 --> 01:01.902
<i>Wait till you meet mine.</i>

01:04.181 --> 01:06.551
 I saw her sitting in the rain

01:07.624 --> 01:10.666
 Raindrops falling on her

01:10.667 --> 01:12.468
 She didn't seem to care

01:12.469 --> 01:14.795
 She sat there and smiled at me

01:17.434 --> 01:20.156
<i> Then I knew
 I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew</i>

01:20.157 --> 01:24.961
<i> She can make me happy
J“ Happy</i>

01:24.962 --> 01:28.244
<i> Flowers in her hair... 
-  Sorry.</i>

01:28.245 --> 01:34.972
 Flowers everywhere
 Like a flower girl

01:34.973 --> 01:39.216
 Oh, I don't know just why
she simply caught my eye

01:39.217 --> 01:41.858
<i> I love the flower girl</i>

01:41.859 --> 01:45.903
 She seemed so sweet and kind
She crept into my mind

01:45.904 --> 01:47.991
<i>Ah</i>

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.035 --> 01:59.557
 I knew I had to say hello

01:59.558 --> 02:02.601
 She smiled up at me

02:02.602 --> 02:06.850
 She took my hand
We walked through the park alone

02:09.288 --> 02:12.011
<i> And I knew
 I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew</i>

02:12.012 --> 02:16.055
<i> She had made me happy
 Happy... </i>

02:16.056 --> 02:17.177
Shit!

02:17.178 --> 02:20.540
 Flowers in her hair
 Her hair

02:20.541 --> 02:26.988
<i> Flowers everywhere
 I love the flower girl</i>

02:26.989 --> 02:31.192
 Oh, I don't know just why
she simply caught my eye

02:31.193 --> 02:33.913
<i> I love the flower girl</i>

02:33.914 --> 02:37.757
 She seemed so sweet and kind
She crept into my mind

02:37.758 --> 02:43.133
<i> Crept into my mind</i>

02:46.929 --> 02:49.299
 Suddenly the sun broke through

02:50.773 --> 02:53.896
 I turned around she was gone
 Where did she go?

02:53.897 --> 02:57.948
 And all I had left
was one little flower in my hand

03:00.543 --> 03:02.503
 But I knew... 
Surprise!

03:02.504 --> 03:04.027
(Shocked gasps)

03:04.028 --> 03:06.429
(Chuckles)

03:07.470 --> 03:09.231
 It's dreary and we love it

03:09.232 --> 03:11.513
 And it smells like rock‘n'roll

03:11.514 --> 03:14.397
 It's not too far from Chiswick
yet it's... 

03:14.398 --> 03:16.519
I think that was
the most embarrassing thing

03:16.520 --> 03:18.246
that's ever happened to anyone ever.

03:18.246 --> 03:20.131
Sorry, mate,
we weren't supposed to know

03:20.132 --> 03:22.286
you'd come through the door
stark bollock naked.

03:22.287 --> 03:24.807
Yeah, I know. It was... thoughtful.

03:24.808 --> 03:27.850
- Come here, good to have you back!
- You're spilling my drink.

03:27.851 --> 03:30.933
Sorry, I've missed you, greasy hippie.

03:30.934 --> 03:33.898
Been stuck here for the last six months
with Luke and bloody Graham.

03:33.899 --> 03:36.180
<i>- You know what that's like.
-  You alright, Graham?</i>

03:36.181 --> 03:37.907
<i>-  This has cheese on it.
- So pick it off.</i>

03:37.908 --> 03:41.146
I can't just pick it off. If I have any
cheese, then I start getting malaise.

03:41.147 --> 03:43.187
<i>-  Malaise.
- Yes, malaise.</i>

03:43.188 --> 03:44.949
Good to see nothing's changed.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.433
<i>- Where's Luke?
-  He's coming later.</i>

03:47.434 --> 03:50.315
Had to go around Sarah's
for the 50 millionth time this week.

03:50.316 --> 03:52.447
<i>- Oh, really?
-  Oh, yeah, it's not been good.</i>

03:52.448 --> 03:54.718
She's been seeing this guy called Chip.

03:54.719 --> 03:58.763
Yeah, imagine if your girlfriend
left you for a guy called Chip.

03:58.764 --> 04:00.491
Not to mention he doesn't have a penis.

04:01.568 --> 04:03.412
What do you mean,
he doesn't have a penis?

04:03.413 --> 04:05.693
Apparently, it got damaged
in a boating accident.

04:05.694 --> 04:07.813
Anyway, how was your trip?
Tell us everything.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.540
- Oh, OK, it was incredible.
- Yeah?

04:09.540 --> 04:11.863
- Did you have sex with anyone?
- Better than that.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.582
- What? What's better than that?
- I'll tell you later.

04:15.583 --> 04:18.543
<i>- Whoa! Did you have a threesome?
-  Look, the party's still going on.</i>

04:18.545 --> 04:19.594
<i>-  Just tell us.
- No.</i>

04:19.595 --> 04:21.627
David, you can't leave us
hanging like this.

04:21.628 --> 04:22.993
I'm getting married.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.512
Right! Everybody out!
Party's over!

04:26.513 --> 04:29.877
Grandad, you've had too much to drink,
you drunken old sod.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.159
How did this happen?

04:32.160 --> 04:34.882
How do you think it happened?
I fell in love.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.564
Her name's Mia. She's Australian.

04:37.565 --> 04:40.047
We met in Tuvalu,
this little island in the Paciﬁc.

04:40.048 --> 04:44.340
And she is the most amazing,
beautiful, intelligent...

04:46.214 --> 04:49.177
You know, the normal thing at this point
is to say congratulations.

04:49.178 --> 04:51.979
Congratulations, I feel like
I've just fucking aged ten years.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.783
Holiday flings are meant to end
at the airport, not at the altar.

04:54.783 --> 04:56.673
Don't listen to him, David,
this is great.

04:56.674 --> 04:59.948
We're right behind you all the way.
Just tell us where the party is.

04:59.949 --> 05:01.916
It's at Mia's parents‘ house
in Australia.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.753
What, is that a fucking joke?

05:04.754 --> 05:08.117
I can't go to Australia, it's bloody
miles away! You know I get air sickness.

05:08.118 --> 05:10.558
Jesus, I thought you'd be
a little bit more supportive

05:10.559 --> 05:13.763
If you don't come, it's just gonna be
me and a load of bloody Australians.

05:13.764 --> 05:15.490
<i>- You're all I got.
-  Excuse me, 20 years</i>

05:15.491 --> 05:18.207
since we've been friends,
when have we ever let you down?

05:18.208 --> 05:21.052
Uh, what about the time you told
Rachel Brookman I had syphilis?

05:21.053 --> 05:23.422
Yeah, apart from that.
When you used to ride your bike

05:23.423 --> 05:27.098
up and down Dorset Street on your own
like some kind of an infant leper,

05:27.099 --> 05:28.987
we were the ones
who took you into our gang.

05:28.988 --> 05:31.142
Even though you were
this lost little orphan boy

05:31.143 --> 05:32.432
who everyone thought was gay.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.424
What do you mean,
everyone thought I was gay?

05:34.425 --> 05:37.347
They did ‘cause you were all sensitive
and nice to people and shit.

05:37.348 --> 05:40.036
Suppose you'll be moving
to a nice two-bed in Hertfordshire?

05:41.633 --> 05:44.194
Oh, you're fucking joking.
You're moving to Australia?

05:44.195 --> 05:46.687
No, it's not set yet.
We'll just... see how it goes.

05:48.761 --> 05:51.203
<i>-  Hey, Luke.
- Hi, David.</i>

05:51.204 --> 05:53.364
<i>- How are you?
-  Yeah, pretty good.</i>

05:53.365 --> 05:55.928
I mean, I feel like I've given
the last five years of my life

05:55.929 --> 05:59.531
in return for unimaginable pain and
torment but aside from that, I'm fine.

05:59.532 --> 06:01.857
David's getting married
and moving to Australia.

06:06.059 --> 06:08.190
(Wails)

06:09.703 --> 06:11.145
Taxi!

06:15.669 --> 06:18.272
Why does she only want you there
one day before the wedding?

06:18.273 --> 06:20.874
<i>- She thought it'd be romantic.
-  You know what bugs me, bruv?</i>

06:20.875 --> 06:23.598
You are about to gamble your life
on a girl you don't even know.

06:23.599 --> 06:25.965
She's not a roulette wheel,
she's the love of my life.

06:25.966 --> 06:27.850
What if she turns out to be
a vagina farter?

06:27.851 --> 06:30.403
Your one serious relationship,
you dumped her ‘cause...

06:30.403 --> 06:32.606
Front bottom burps, noisy flange,
disgusting.

06:32.607 --> 06:34.331
When you lose your parents young,
Tom,

06:34.332 --> 06:36.536
you learn to roll the dice
when it's handed to you.

06:36.537 --> 06:39.613
Oh, I've taken you to Blackpool,
brother, you're a terrible gambler.

06:39.614 --> 06:41.977
- What exactly have I got to lose?
- Us!

06:41.978 --> 06:43.387
Aww...

06:44.339 --> 06:47.022
Couldn't lose you if you were a suitcase
at Terminal Five.

06:47.023 --> 06:49.824
I'm just looking out for you,
that's all. I don't know this girl.

06:49.825 --> 06:51.266
And neither do you.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.468
DAVID: Don't you believe
in love at first sight?

06:53.469 --> 06:56.511
I just can't believe you're
getting married. It's just so grown-up

06:56.512 --> 06:57.993
Every time I look at you,

06:57.994 --> 07:00.437
I still see a little eight-year-old waif
in gym shorts.

07:00.438 --> 07:01.918
That's a bit weird.

07:01.919 --> 07:04.440
- Hi.
- Luke.

07:04.441 --> 07:06.203
- How are you?
- Awful.

07:06.204 --> 07:08.644
Sarah and Chip
have officially moved in together.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.373
<i>-  I'm so sorry, mate.
- Yeah.</i>

07:10.374 --> 07:13.690
Well, maybe this trip will do you some
good. Maybe you'll get some distance.

07:13.691 --> 07:15.417
<i>- Maybe the plane will crash.
-  Sorry.</i>

07:17.334 --> 07:19.215
Sorry.

07:19.216 --> 07:20.817
Sorry I'm late.

07:20.818 --> 07:24.061
Picking up my new business cards -
going global.

07:24.062 --> 07:27.874
Hitler's selling underfloor heating to
Australians. Oh, this is gonna be huge.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.308
- Graham, what is that on your face?
- What?

07:31.309 --> 07:33.470
That. That monstrosity.

07:33.471 --> 07:36.514
- Oh, you mean the moustache?
- Yes, the moustache.

07:36.515 --> 07:40.359
I'm about to meet my future family, I
can't have you turn up looking like a...

07:40.360 --> 07:42.439
- Like a...
- Genocidal Fascist dictator.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.402
What are you talking about?
Moustaches are really in at the moment.

07:45.403 --> 07:48.166
<i>- Not Hitler moustaches.
-  Look, it's how my facial hair grows.</i>

07:48.167 --> 07:50.608
Alright? I can't help the fact
it looks like Hitler's.

07:50.609 --> 07:52.571
Why are you being so negative,
anyway?

07:52.572 --> 07:54.132
Why can't it be a Chaplin moustache?

07:54.133 --> 07:55.815
- Sit down, you're in the way.
- Sorry.

07:56.775 --> 07:59.178
<i>- Jesus!
-  Bloody Hitler.</i>

07:59.179 --> 08:01.179
Ruined this moustache for everyone.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.503
Guys...

08:04.144 --> 08:06.665
- We're going to Australia.
- Yeah, with 14 stopovers.

08:06.666 --> 08:09.713
Yes, stewardess! A bottle of your
cheapest champagne, please!

08:13.154 --> 08:15.514
Toast to my friend, David Locking!

08:15.515 --> 08:17.045
Mr David Locking!

08:18.559 --> 08:21.607
Jorge Buentiempo! (Speaks Spanish)

08:24.645 --> 08:29.299
..754 miles, 8,754 miles.

08:33.895 --> 08:37.177
Coconut Mist.
Now available duty-free. Coconut Mist.

08:37.178 --> 08:40.662
I thought that was never gonna end.
It was worse than a jazz concert.

08:40.663 --> 08:42.102
Really? I slept most of the way.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.826
That's ‘cause you weren't sitting
next to the droning clock.

08:44.827 --> 08:46.948
I can't believe
he's doing the best man speech.

08:46.949 --> 08:49.551
<i>- I've have done much better.
-  Thought I'd give him a boost.</i>

08:49.552 --> 08:52.354
- Something else to focus on.
- I'd have been fuckin' hilarious.

08:52.355 --> 08:54.195
- David Locking?
- Yes?

08:54.196 --> 08:56.078
Come this way, please.

08:56.079 --> 08:57.520
(Dog grunts)

08:57.521 --> 08:59.282
- Take the bag.
- Why?

08:59.283 --> 09:02.324
I've got something in it for David's
stag do. I don't want it searched.

09:02.325 --> 09:04.609
<i>- Absolutely not.
-  Look at me, I'm sweaty.</i>

09:04.610 --> 09:07.570
I look guilty as hell. They won't
search you, you're too confident.

09:07.571 --> 09:09.092
True and I'm still not taking it.

09:09.093 --> 09:12.375
- Uh, have we done something wrong?
- Not at all, Mr Locking.

09:12.376 --> 09:15.538
I work for your father-in-law and
you're going straight to the VIP room.

09:15.539 --> 09:17.821
Welcome to Australia.
(Elevator dings)

09:17.821 --> 09:19.822
VIP. Bloody damn it.

09:19.823 --> 09:22.666
Now they're never gonna
X-ray your bag.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.514
<i>AUTOMATED VOICE:
Welcome to VIP X-ray.</i>

09:24.515 --> 09:26.758
<i>Please hand your bags
to the attendant.</i>

09:27.832 --> 09:29.798
<i>(Alarm sounds)</i>

09:30.875 --> 09:32.887
- Graham Vincent?
- Yes?

09:40.005 --> 09:42.255
MAN: Shall we pop this
in your duty-free bag, sir?

09:44.330 --> 09:47.053
<i>- That was embarrassing.
-  Why d'you get a gimp mask, anyway?</i>

09:47.054 --> 09:49.183
<i>- Who does that?
-  I thought it'd be a laugh.</i>

09:49.184 --> 09:50.936
(Sighs) We're in Australia.

09:50.937 --> 09:52.417
Who could survive here?

09:52.418 --> 09:54.820
All that sun and beefs
gonna piss you off eventually.

09:54.821 --> 09:56.262
I could learn to live with it.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.383
Gonna call Sarah,
let her know we've arrived.

09:58.384 --> 10:01.267
Yeah, she's probably sitting
by the phone counting the minutes.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.708
There she is. There's Mia.

10:02.709 --> 10:04.752
LUKE: Damn signal.
(David laughs)

10:07.594 --> 10:09.195
Mia!

10:09.196 --> 10:11.043
MIA: David!

10:13.161 --> 10:16.283
<i>- Oh, you alright?
-  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.</i>

10:16.284 --> 10:17.763
I'm good.

10:17.764 --> 10:19.847
- How was the flight?
- Fine.

10:19.848 --> 10:21.616
<i>-  Really long, though.
- Yeah?</i>

10:21.617 --> 10:22.889
Yeah...

10:22.890 --> 10:25.252
<i>-  I'll leave you to it, then.
- OK.</i>

10:25.253 --> 10:28.015
<i>-  Meet the guys. Uh, this is...
- No, no, no, don't tell me.</i>

10:28.016 --> 10:31.459
Um, Tom, Luke and...

10:31.460 --> 10:33.262
This is a Chaplin moustache
by the way.

10:33.263 --> 10:34.303
..Graham.

10:34.303 --> 10:36.224
David's pretty much told me everything.

10:36.225 --> 10:38.551
Well, I hope he hasn't been
slagging us off too much.

10:38.552 --> 10:41.350
Of course not. He just called you
a pack of pricks but that was it.

10:41.351 --> 10:44.552
<i>- What, really?
-  No, no! He didn't really.</i>

10:44.553 --> 10:46.879
Anyway, I brought the big car
so we're all gonna fit.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.318
- It's OK, we've organized a car rental.
- Are you sure?

10:49.319 --> 10:52.200
It's quite a hike and might be
the only time I get you all to myself.

10:52.201 --> 10:55.403
<i>- Well, then, spend it with David.
-  You don't know where you're going.</i>

10:55.404 --> 10:58.047
And God created satellites.
It's fine, Graham's driving.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.969
- What? No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

10:59.970 --> 11:03.733
Go, go and exchange some bodily fluids,
you know, we'll see you later.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.504
Alright, cool.

11:07.659 --> 11:09.338
- See you later.
- See ya.

11:09.339 --> 11:10.499
<i>Bye.</i>

11:10.500 --> 11:12.542
<i>LUKE: ..this is my
chair, I paid for it.</i>

11:12.543 --> 11:14.424
- We good?
- Yeah.

11:14.425 --> 11:17.627
LUKE: Don't hang up, don't hang up,
please! Come on. Sarah!

11:17.628 --> 11:19.629
Luke, come on, man.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.391
- Sarah, she's...
- Oh, shut up.

11:21.392 --> 11:24.035
- So, here we are.
- Yep.

11:24.036 --> 11:26.557
(Sighs) We're getting married tomorrow.

11:26.558 --> 11:27.798
Yep.

11:27.799 --> 11:30.123
Doesn't give me much time
to get to know your parents.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.044
Oh, we've got all the time in the world.

11:33.045 --> 11:35.567
God... I've waited...
three whole months...

11:37.089 --> 11:39.371
<i>(Beeping)</i>

11:43.976 --> 11:46.106
Ooh, what have we here?

11:48.581 --> 11:50.907
LUKE: I don't think she was that happy
to hear from me.

11:50.908 --> 11:53.025
What, really? What's wrong with her?

11:53.026 --> 11:55.909
See, if I broke up with a girl,
what I'd want her to do

11:55.910 --> 11:58.030
is ring me and hassle me constantly.

11:58.031 --> 12:01.114
<i>- At least I've had a girl.
-  I've had girlfriends, Luke.</i>

12:01.115 --> 12:02.840
Inflatable girlfriends don't count.

12:02.841 --> 12:06.278
Look, I've told you a thousand times,
that was delivered to me by mistake.

12:06.279 --> 12:08.650
Anyway, I will phone her
and I'll keep phoning her

12:08.651 --> 12:10.123
until she agrees to take me back.

12:10.124 --> 12:12.085
<i>- Good plan, Luke!
-  (Graham chuckles)</i>

12:12.086 --> 12:13.606
(Mia giggles)

12:13.607 --> 12:16.338
DAVID: I can't believe
I can actually reach out and touch you.

12:20.094 --> 12:21.615
(Both laugh)

12:21.616 --> 12:24.218
If it wasn't for that photo,
I'd swear Tuvalu was just...

12:24.219 --> 12:26.060
A dream?

12:26.061 --> 12:30.113
Yeah, sometimes I wish I'd just snap
my ﬁngers and we'd be back there.

12:31.786 --> 12:33.436
Be careful what you wish for.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.286
What are we doing
in the middle of the jungle, Tom?

12:46.287 --> 12:48.404
Does that thing have any idea
where it's going?

12:48.405 --> 12:50.325
Yeah, we're just on a small detour.

12:50.326 --> 12:53.048
Found this guy, he said he could sell us
some weed for tonight.

12:53.048 --> 12:57.813
Are you mental? I'm not taking a detour
to some skanky drug dealer's house.

12:57.814 --> 12:59.497
We're supposed to be here for David!

12:59.498 --> 13:01.176
This is for David, bell end.

13:01.177 --> 13:04.180
For his stag night. We can't have
stag night without weed, can we?

13:04.181 --> 13:06.222
- Can't we?
- No!

13:06.223 --> 13:08.309
It's just down here, anyway. Turn left.

13:15.953 --> 13:17.797
DAVID: Yester?
MIA: Yester Grange.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.641
Oldest house
in the Blue Mountains.

13:19.642 --> 13:21.123
DAVID: Wow.

13:26.885 --> 13:30.774
Mum, Daph, meet David.

13:33.532 --> 13:36.094
David, this is my adorable mum,
Barbara.

13:36.095 --> 13:38.857
Welcome to the family, David.

13:38.857 --> 13:40.989
(cries)

13:43.783 --> 13:46.104
Um, Mum, he's British,
you're scaring him.

13:46.105 --> 13:48.235
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:49.589 --> 13:53.071
<i>- Um, hi, I'm Daphne.
-  Daph, my sister and my bestest mate.</i>

13:53.072 --> 13:55.154
Great to meet you.

13:55.155 --> 13:56.881
- So where's...
DAPHNE: The old crock?

13:56.882 --> 14:01.880
<i>My husband has been the only man
in this house for almost 25 years.</i>

14:01.881 --> 14:05.367
So, please, excuse his...

14:07.408 --> 14:08.968
..enthusiasm.

14:08.969 --> 14:11.811
<i>- Right.
- Don't worry, he won't eat you.</i>

14:11.812 --> 14:13.974
Yeah, we fed him a big breakfast.

14:13.975 --> 14:16.696
So, sweetheart,
ready to meet the senator?

14:16.697 --> 14:19.145
Uh, yeah. Can't wait.

14:25.627 --> 14:28.069
You're not seriously getting out
of the car, are you?

14:28.070 --> 14:30.431
- Haven't you seen Wolf Creek?
- What?

14:30.432 --> 14:31.872
It'll be fine.

14:31.873 --> 14:34.435
<i>- You coming, Luke?
-  You go, just leave me here to die.</i>

14:34.436 --> 14:37.318
Luke, can you look after my bag,
please? It's got all my stuff in it.

14:37.319 --> 14:40.246
After I've been raped and murdered
and out into small pieces, sure.

14:42.245 --> 14:44.887
Wait! Wait!

14:47.771 --> 14:50.493
Tom, can we get in and out
as quickly as possible, please?

14:50.494 --> 14:51.695
He's a drug dealer, Graham.

14:51.696 --> 14:53.736
Do you think we're gonna stay
for tea and cakes?

14:53.737 --> 14:55.778
You're the one
who brought your overnight bag.

14:55.779 --> 14:59.302
JIM: I told the caterer, no wheat,
no dairy, no nuts,

14:59.303 --> 15:02.345
no gluten, no seafood, no marzipan.
What's so hard about that?

15:02.346 --> 15:04.386
BARBARA: Jim!

15:04.387 --> 15:07.509
- It's time.
JIM: Well, well, well.

15:07.510 --> 15:09.993
We meet at last.

15:09.994 --> 15:11.594
The hero of Tuvalu.

15:11.595 --> 15:13.557
MIA: David, my dad, Jim Ramme.

15:13.558 --> 15:16.039
JIM: Hmm, I was expecting
a little more beef.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.364
Dad... be supportive.

15:19.365 --> 15:22.446
Yeah, I'd give him a minute
before you start busting his balls.

15:22.447 --> 15:24.169
I see you've met Daphne.

15:24.170 --> 15:26.891
There we were, hoping
she'd get married as well one day.

15:26.892 --> 15:28.652
Turns out she's a lesbian.

15:28.653 --> 15:32.816
David, you must be exhausted.
Would you like to freshen up?

15:32.817 --> 15:34.020
Actually, that'd be...

15:34.021 --> 15:37.061
He probably wants to get stuck into
the grand tour, don't you, Dave?

15:37.062 --> 15:40.351
(Laughs) You know, it's been a really
long flight and everything so...

15:41.988 --> 15:43.670
The tour would be great.

15:49.396 --> 15:52.799
- Hi! Are you Ray?
- No.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.600
We're looking for Ray.

15:54.601 --> 15:57.002
Said we could come by and get some -
(Clicks tongue)

15:57.003 --> 15:59.133
You know... Some weed.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.610
Come inside.

16:05.612 --> 16:07.535
Mad Frank send you?

16:07.536 --> 16:10.102
No, I emailed you. Um...

16:11.419 --> 16:14.105
I'm Tom, from the website, remember?

16:15.943 --> 16:19.707
<i>- Who's the bag man?
-  It's just my friend, Graham.</i>

16:19.707 --> 16:23.191
This isn't a Hitler moustache, by the
way. It's just how my facial hair grows.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.721
RAY: Sit the fuck down.
TOM: OK.

16:32.681 --> 16:35.804
So, how much do you need?

16:35.805 --> 16:38.491
Five, ten kilos?

16:40.930 --> 16:42.895
Just an eighth if that's cool.

16:44.615 --> 16:46.574
It's for a friend's stag night.

16:46.575 --> 16:48.296
<i>(Dog whimpers)</i>

16:48.297 --> 16:50.219
I'd prefer it if you tried it first.

16:50.220 --> 16:52.982
I don't want you pounding down
my door in the middle of the night

16:52.983 --> 16:54.424
saying I sold you dodgy grass.

16:54.425 --> 16:56.947
(Chuckles nervously)
I don't think we'll be doing that.

16:58.068 --> 17:00.952
I said,
I'd prefer it if you tried it first.

17:09.721 --> 17:12.482
<i>TOM: Tastes good, doesn't it?
-  (Coughs)</i>

17:12.483 --> 17:14.844
Tastes quite... Quite fruity.

17:14.845 --> 17:16.326
JIM: Next up, the sauna.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.368
12-inch window with a five-star view.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.492
(David laughs) That's funny.

17:21.492 --> 17:25.936
<i>-  That wasn't a joke, Dave.
MIA: Grandad built that sauna in 1963.</i>

17:25.938 --> 17:30.541
Carpenter, struggling to raise seven
children, now I own the whole property.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.625
You can have it all, Dave, if you
don't mind getting your hands dirty.

17:33.626 --> 17:35.707
You see that house over there?

17:35.708 --> 17:38.077
You play your cards right
and it's got your name on it.

17:39.711 --> 17:42.394
- So, you guys mates?
- Yeah.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.276
Grew up on the same street.

17:44.277 --> 17:48.199
I used to have mates but most of them
are in prison or dead now.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.324
Look, I've tried making new friends,
you know, on the internet and that

17:51.324 --> 17:53.766
but I don't know,
you can't trust anyone.

17:53.767 --> 17:56.809
One day they're your best mate,

17:56.810 --> 17:59.451
the next they're stabbing you
in the back for a gram of speed

17:59.452 --> 18:01.495
and you wind up
having to break their kneecaps

18:01.496 --> 18:03.936
with a fucking ironing board,
then where are ya?

18:03.937 --> 18:06.428
- D'you mind if I use your toilet?
- In the meth lab.

18:08.903 --> 18:10.269
Tom...

18:14.468 --> 18:17.832
Hey, would you like to see
my new tattoo?

18:19.475 --> 18:20.677
Yeah.

18:23.638 --> 18:25.039
(Gasps)

18:25.040 --> 18:27.530
- Ain't she a corker?
- Yeah.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.446
<i>- What is it?
-  Well, it's a little kid crying.</i>

18:32.447 --> 18:36.091
And those are his bastard parents
leaving him for dead.

18:36.092 --> 18:37.771
It's original.

18:37.772 --> 18:39.454
And I've saved the best for last.

18:39.455 --> 18:42.898
Pull your socks up, Dave,
‘cause they're about to get knocked off.

18:42.899 --> 18:45.621
This is it - Jim Ramme HQ.

18:45.622 --> 18:48.665
DAVID: It's... impressive.

18:48.666 --> 18:51.387
MIA: This is also
where we keep Ramsy.

18:51.388 --> 18:53.470
Uh, who's Ramsy?

18:53.471 --> 18:55.430
DAPHNE: He's the son Dad never had.

18:55.431 --> 18:58.113
- I thought you were.
- (Daphne smirks)

18:58.114 --> 19:00.596
Prepare yourself, Dave,
to meet the numero uno,

19:00.597 --> 19:03.240
the king of kings,
the champion of champions.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.124
This is Ramsy.

19:07.245 --> 19:09.211
DAVID: Wow. A sheep.

19:10.688 --> 19:12.169
In the house.

19:12.170 --> 19:14.611
He's not just any old sheep.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.940
The day I was photographed
with this golden fleece,

19:16.941 --> 19:18.816
my political career turned around.

19:18.817 --> 19:21.057
<i>(Groans) (Woman clears throat)</i>

19:21.058 --> 19:25.542
You've met my terrifyingly efﬁcient
right-hand woman, Maureen Coate.

19:25.543 --> 19:28.626
Mr Locking, I prepared an Excel
spreadsheet of the proceedings

19:28.627 --> 19:30.667
for you and your colourful companions.

19:30.668 --> 19:32.680
David, where are your friends?

19:35.113 --> 19:37.475
- You got parents?
- Uh, yes.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.197
Oh, you're lucky.

19:39.198 --> 19:40.639
Yeah, my parents disowned me

19:40.640 --> 19:43.008
when I got done
for aggravated assault and battery

19:43.009 --> 19:44.444
at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

19:44.445 --> 19:46.727
I still think about them.

19:47.926 --> 19:51.050
<i>- My parents...
-  It's only natural.</i>

19:51.051 --> 19:53.571
(Sniffs)

19:53.572 --> 19:59.299
Can I share with you
something personal?

19:59.300 --> 20:02.583
I've started getting panic attacks.

20:02.584 --> 20:05.666
One minute I'll just be sitting down
real nice and calm

20:05.667 --> 20:08.268
and the next, I don't know,
I feel like I'm gonna shit myself

20:08.269 --> 20:09.910
or I'm gonna puke or...

20:09.911 --> 20:11.872
I feel like I'm trapped in a sauna,
you know?

20:11.873 --> 20:14.363
Can't breathe, it's all sweaty,
it's fucked.

20:17.358 --> 20:20.681
Wow. Wow. Wow.

20:20.682 --> 20:22.723
I don't know what it is but...

20:22.724 --> 20:25.608
(Sighs) I feel like you and I...

20:26.928 --> 20:30.260
..you know,
we've got a really special connection.

20:32.174 --> 20:33.896
Tom!

20:33.897 --> 20:36.377
- Hey, you want to see something cool?
- Yeah!

20:36.378 --> 20:38.149
Wait there.

20:40.582 --> 20:43.625
Can we get out of here, please?
This guy's starting to freak me out.

20:43.626 --> 20:46.388
MIA: So, gloves off, what do you think?

20:46.389 --> 20:47.949
Shrewd choice, sweet pea...

20:47.950 --> 20:52.155
handsome, sweet, diplomatically quiet.

20:52.156 --> 20:55.998
Yeah, and you know what they say
about the quiet ones?

20:55.999 --> 20:57.840
Tomorrow's gonna be tough.

20:57.841 --> 21:01.125
My little girl says you can handle it
and that's good enough for me.

21:01.126 --> 21:05.367
Half the power brokers in Australia
are going to be in that marquee.

21:05.368 --> 21:09.012
The knives will be out and
they won't be for cutting the cake.

21:09.013 --> 21:10.575
But watch them fall on their swords

21:10.576 --> 21:15.379
when you and future senator
Mia Ramme step up to the mike.

21:15.380 --> 21:18.062
- Mia wants to be a senator?
- She sure does.

21:18.063 --> 21:19.584
She just doesn't know it yet.

21:19.584 --> 21:22.467
Here, check this shit out.

21:22.468 --> 21:24.028
Just got it in from Malaysia.

21:24.029 --> 21:26.832
This fat old woman,
she swallowed the lot

21:26.833 --> 21:28.473
and shat them out into a bowl.

21:28.474 --> 21:30.514
I got a big fucking bag of it, eh.

21:30.515 --> 21:33.037
<i>- Interested? -  I don't...
It's not really my thing.</i>

21:33.038 --> 21:34.519
But... Oh, is that the time?

21:34.520 --> 21:36.641
We should probably go now, Tom,
don't you think?

21:36.642 --> 21:39.765
Well, I was thinking maybe while
you're in town, we could go for a beer.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.167
<i>- Huh?
-  We'll go for a beer.</i>

21:42.168 --> 21:46.011
Well, I'd love to
but we've got lots on so...

21:46.012 --> 21:48.295
- What have we got going on?
- We've got the wedding.

21:48.296 --> 21:50.937
Yeah, but after the wedding,
we've got literally nothing.

21:50.938 --> 21:53.580
Terrific. You give us your number
and I'll give you a call.

21:53.581 --> 21:55.061
<i>- My number?
-  Yeah, yeah.</i>

21:55.062 --> 21:57.944
Uh, my number. Well, I can't
remember it ‘cause it's a new phone.

21:57.945 --> 21:59.832
Here, just take
one of his business cards.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.192
It's got his number, his email

22:01.193 --> 22:03.630
and if you really have nothing to do,
there's Twitter.

22:03.631 --> 22:06.272
Maybe we could go out for a meal,
yeah?

22:06.273 --> 22:08.196
- Yeah, that would be fantastic.
- Great.

22:09.678 --> 22:11.566
<i>-  Don't worry about it.
- Thanks, man.</i>

22:15.444 --> 22:18.568
- So, it's a date?
- Yeah.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.613
Total bloody knob end.

22:25.614 --> 22:27.174
Why d'you give that guy my card?

22:27.175 --> 22:29.019
I don't want to go to dinner
with that guy!

22:29.020 --> 22:31.147
<i>- Don't you?
-  Of course not! He's a psychopath!</i>

22:31.148 --> 22:33.782
Let's get out of here before
he invites me on a weekend break.

22:33.783 --> 22:36.185
(Laughs)

22:42.113 --> 22:43.554
CATERER: Ah!
(Crash!)

22:46.156 --> 22:48.356
Jesus Christ on a bike!

22:48.357 --> 22:51.766
Dave, your... mates are here.

22:59.530 --> 23:02.052
Interesting choice of facial scrub
you got there, fella.

23:02.053 --> 23:03.534
It's just the way my hair grows.

23:03.535 --> 23:06.537
Well, there's only room for one dictator
in this family.

23:06.538 --> 23:09.630
I'm so hungry, I could eat
a sack full of baby kittens.

23:11.303 --> 23:14.024
This is amazing, Barbara. What is it?

23:14.025 --> 23:17.467
We have Crystal Cove prawns,
Coffin Bay oysters

23:17.468 --> 23:20.757
and lobster mornay in a cheese sauce.

23:22.274 --> 23:24.595
(Graham retches)

23:24.596 --> 23:26.757
(Tom chuckles)

23:26.758 --> 23:29.961
Sorry - it's cheese.

23:29.962 --> 23:31.602
I get malaise.

23:31.603 --> 23:33.645
So, what do you do, Luke?

23:33.646 --> 23:36.568
I fall in love with women who then shit
on me from a great height.

23:36.569 --> 23:39.572
You shouldn't put them on a pedestal.

23:39.573 --> 23:41.657
So what are the bride and groom
going to be doing

23:41.658 --> 23:43.296
on their final night of freedom?

23:43.297 --> 23:47.059
Oh, we're gonna crank up the Abba,
turn on the sauna, get pedicures.

23:47.060 --> 23:49.141
Maybe do some underarm hair waxing.

23:49.142 --> 23:52.625
- Oh, Daphne. Girls only, I'm afraid.
- Oh, that's a shame.

23:52.626 --> 23:54.547
What about you boys?

23:54.548 --> 23:56.873
I think we'll just head out,
have a quiet drink or two.

23:56.874 --> 23:58.670
<i>- Just two?
-  You're welcome to join us.</i>

23:58.671 --> 24:01.043
Yeah, Jim, come with us.
We're gonna get wankered.

24:01.044 --> 24:02.596
Not wankered.

24:02.597 --> 24:05.087
Don't listen to what he says,
we're gonna get wankered.

24:06.601 --> 24:08.962
I'm sorry about my friends,
that was awful.

24:08.963 --> 24:10.843
Come on, they're really funny.

24:10.844 --> 24:13.407
They're not meant to be funny,
they're meant to be normal.

24:13.408 --> 24:16.050
Baby, it's a wedding, OK?
Worlds collide.

24:16.051 --> 24:17.580
(sighs)

24:22.698 --> 24:24.539
So, this is it, isn't it?

24:24.540 --> 24:27.061
I'm not gonna see you
till you're walking down the aisle.

24:27.062 --> 24:28.668
Afraid not.

24:30.787 --> 24:32.946
Love you, Mr Locking.

24:32.947 --> 24:34.718
(sighs)

24:36.552 --> 24:39.354
<i>- Fuck me, mate, she's loaded.
-  Can you keep your voice down?</i>

24:39.355 --> 24:41.202
Alright, David? You seem a bit stressed.

24:41.203 --> 24:43.798
I am stressed. I just found out
I'm about to marry a Kennedy,

24:43.799 --> 24:45.361
you turn up acting like morons.

24:45.362 --> 24:47.923
<i>- Who's acting like morons?
-  You vomited onto your plate.</i>

24:47.924 --> 24:50.208
<i>- It had cheese.
-  Look, this wedding is important.</i>

24:50.209 --> 24:53.009
More important than anything ever
so I need everyone to behave.

24:53.010 --> 24:54.852
(Bu rps)

24:54.853 --> 24:56.213
OK.

24:56.214 --> 25:00.822
(Sighs) I'm not going anywhere
and you're not getting me wankered.

25:02.539 --> 25:05.221
DAVID: I'm completely wankered,
you bastards.

25:05.222 --> 25:08.185
TOM: 11th hour with the lads, of course
you were gonna get wankered.

25:08.186 --> 25:11.107
LUKE: You're not seriously going
to move out here, are you, David?

25:11.108 --> 25:12.869
What‘ll happen to us if you go?

25:12.870 --> 25:16.914
DAVID: I'll always be there for you,
mate, wherever I am.

25:16.915 --> 25:19.317
We're practically brothers.

25:19.318 --> 25:24.121
So what? If Chip doesn't have a penis,
it doesn't reflect on you.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.123
LUKE: Who told you
Chip doesn't have a penis?

25:26.124 --> 25:27.885
<i>-  Tom did.
- Tom!</i>

25:27.886 --> 25:30.168
TOM: That Chip has sailed! (Laughs)

25:30.169 --> 25:31.651
This place is a nightmare.

25:31.652 --> 25:34.613
They don't tell you about all this shit
in the adverts, do they?

25:34.614 --> 25:36.214
Guys, watch this.

25:36.215 --> 25:38.456
Graham. Graham.

25:38.457 --> 25:40.419
What the fuck is that on your neck,
man?

25:40.420 --> 25:41.901
(squeals)

25:41.902 --> 25:44.064
(All laugh)
- Get it off me! Get it off me!

25:46.867 --> 25:49.188
Get off me! Get off me!

25:49.189 --> 25:52.031
Seriously, where is it? Where is it?
Where is it, guys?

25:52.032 --> 25:54.554
It's on the ground, Graham,
with all the other leaves.

25:54.555 --> 25:57.437
(All laugh)
GRAHAM: Bastards.

25:57.438 --> 25:59.718
<i>(Bleating)</i>

25:59.719 --> 26:02.002
What the fuck do we have here?

26:02.003 --> 26:03.963
<i>(Laughing)</i>

26:03.964 --> 26:06.335
GRAHAM: Look at the size
of his man boobs.

26:09.291 --> 26:11.091
This isn't just any sheep, Graham.

26:11.092 --> 26:13.374
This is Ramsy.

26:13.375 --> 26:15.057
The ram behind the man.

26:18.580 --> 26:22.944
TOM: David, get in there.
DAVID: No, no, I will not...

26:22.945 --> 26:25.435
<i>(Laughing and bleating)</i>

26:28.872 --> 26:32.794
Six hours and 59 minutes till lift-off.
Go, go, go, people!

26:32.795 --> 26:34.402
(Sounds horn)
- Come on!

26:37.320 --> 26:39.282
<i>(Door opens) (Gasps)</i>

26:39.282 --> 26:41.002
It's not too late to elope.

26:41.003 --> 26:44.687
(Laughs) Oh, yeah, Dad would be cool
if I went and eloped.

26:44.688 --> 26:48.131
Yeah, leave it to me to do
all the bad-ass stuff in this family.

26:48.132 --> 26:51.974
Like smoking, failing uni,
eating cheesecake.

26:51.975 --> 26:55.619
And pretending to be a lesbian
just to piss Dad off.

26:55.620 --> 26:58.703
Daph, is it normal to feel this nervous?

26:58.703 --> 27:02.506
Yeah, you could be about to make
the biggest mistake of your life.

27:02.507 --> 27:05.950
 It's a beautiful morning

27:05.951 --> 27:08.271
 Oh, oh... 
(Gasps)

27:08.272 --> 27:12.116
 I think I'll just go outside
for a while

27:12.117 --> 27:14.804
 And just smile

27:15.920 --> 27:19.403
 Just take in
some clean fresh air, boy

27:19.404 --> 27:22.486
 Ain't no sense in staying inside

27:22.487 --> 27:27.093
 If the weather’s fine
and you still got the time

27:27.093 --> 27:30.015
 It's your chance to wake up and plan

27:30.016 --> 27:32.858
<i> Another brand-new day
 Either way</i>

27:32.859 --> 27:35.581
 It's a beautiful morning... 

27:35.582 --> 27:37.182
Aaah!

27:37.183 --> 27:39.946
- Fuck it!

27:39.946 --> 27:42.187
<i>GRAHAM: Luke! Tom!

27:42.188 --> 27:46.112
<i>- What are you shouting about?
-  What do you think I'm shouting about?</i>

27:46.113 --> 27:49.154
- Get it off me!
- (Laughs)

27:49.155 --> 27:52.999
- Alright, alright, calm down.
- (Whimpers)

27:53.000 --> 27:56.002
Quick! Get it off me, please.
I can't breathe.

27:56.003 --> 27:58.004
- What do you look like?
- Just get it off me.

27:58.005 --> 27:59.485
- (Laughs)
- Please.

27:59.486 --> 28:03.409
 ..sun shines
when you're still inside, man

28:03.410 --> 28:05.492
 Still inside

28:05.493 --> 28:08.576
 Still inside, the sun shines... 

28:08.577 --> 28:10.139
Hey, Ramsy.

28:12.059 --> 28:13.709
(Bleats)

28:15.664 --> 28:17.630
Oh, for fuck's sake.

<i>(Knock on door)
- Hang on, I got to get that.</i>

28:38.929 --> 28:41.409
No, not while I'm like this, Tom.

28:41.410 --> 28:43.934
- What the fuck happened to my hand?
- Tom...

28:45.415 --> 28:47.977
- Tom.
- Barbara, hi.

28:47.978 --> 28:51.430
I see you made it through
the big night out in one piece.

28:53.864 --> 28:58.148
Um, just checking
if you needed any clean... towels.

28:58.149 --> 29:01.032
No, I think we're OK for towels.
Graham?

29:01.033 --> 29:05.436
<i>- Need some towels?
-  Uh, no, thanks, Barbara. Thank you.</i>

29:05.437 --> 29:08.239
TOM: David might like some.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.971
BARBARA: Rightio, then.

29:12.724 --> 29:14.209
Bye, Barbara.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.251
(Hums The Wedding March)

29:24.577 --> 29:26.947
- (Ramsy bleats)
- (Clears throat)

29:28.861 --> 29:31.543
Morning, David!
All ready for the big day?

29:31.544 --> 29:32.745
Yeah.

29:32.746 --> 29:34.826
Just wondering if I could check
in your room...

29:34.827 --> 29:38.070
God, no! Uh, I mean, no. Thanks.

29:38.071 --> 29:40.954
<i>(Bleating)
- (Laughs)</i>

29:40.955 --> 29:44.196
OK, well, if you need anything,
if you need anything at all,

29:44.197 --> 29:45.718
you just let me know, OK?

29:45.719 --> 29:47.159
Yep.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.810
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.854
<i>(Graham groans)
-  You alright, bruv?</i>

29:59.534 --> 30:01.303
GRAHAM: Back off.
- Jesus, Graham!

30:01.304 --> 30:03.217
Why are you wearing a gimp mask?

30:03.218 --> 30:06.299
Ah! He put it on me while I was asleep.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.302
I don't know why
you thought that'd be funny.

30:08.303 --> 30:10.905
- Yeah, must be insane, it's not funny.
- Stop it!

30:10.906 --> 30:14.028
The bigger question is
what is Ramsy doing in my room?

30:14.029 --> 30:15.830
- Who?
- The sheep!

30:17.793 --> 30:19.554
Jim's sheep.

30:19.555 --> 30:22.197
That's right, the little fucker bit me

30:22.198 --> 30:24.719
It's in my room
just like a lady... sheep.

30:24.720 --> 30:27.963
- That was your idea to put it in drag.
- Oh, yeah, I did, didn't I?

30:27.964 --> 30:29.925
I thought it'd be quite funny
at the time.

30:29.926 --> 30:32.688
You need to get him back
before someone realises he's missing.

30:32.689 --> 30:35.851
If Jim finds out we fucked with Ram,
he's gonna go apes hit.

30:35.852 --> 30:38.413
And I don't want to deal with that
on my wedding day, do you?

30:38.414 --> 30:40.856
<i>- No.
-  Right then, so fix it.</i>

30:40.857 --> 30:44.660
Get her... him back to the old house.

30:44.661 --> 30:46.103
Sorry.

30:54.071 --> 30:55.274
<i>(Bleating)</i>

30:55.275 --> 31:00.242
 I rode my bicycle
past your window last night

31:01.718 --> 31:06.803
 I roller skated to your door
at daylight

31:06.804 --> 31:09.047
 It almost seemed... 
- Tom, seriously!

31:09.048 --> 31:10.817
Can you stop filming me, please?

31:14.573 --> 31:17.294
 But you got something I need... 

31:17.295 --> 31:20.579
It's an elephant in sheep's clothing.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.500
Oh, bless. It kind of suits him.

31:22.501 --> 31:25.583
- Just, please, sort this out, OK?
(Luke groans)

31:25.584 --> 31:27.954
And, Graham, shave off
that bloody Hitler moustache

31:27.955 --> 31:29.509
or you're not coming to the wedding.

31:29.509 --> 31:31.549
<i>- Seriously?
-  Yes, seriously.</i>

31:31.550 --> 31:32.831
(Bleats)

31:32.832 --> 31:34.633
 You got something for me?

31:34.634 --> 31:38.277
 Oh, I got a brand-new pair
of roller skates

31:38.278 --> 31:40.400
 You got a brand-new key... 

31:40.401 --> 31:42.444

31:43.684 --> 31:45.524
Hi, Sarah, it's Luke.

31:45.525 --> 31:47.768
Four in the morning? Oh, I'm sorry.

31:47.769 --> 31:50.329
 Don't go too fast

31:50.330 --> 31:52.572
 But I go pretty far... 

31:52.573 --> 31:55.375
Tom, shouldn't you put some clothes on
while you're doing that?

31:55.376 --> 31:57.583
- You think he wants to see you naked?
- He's naked.

31:57.584 --> 32:00.139
- Don't be so repressed, Graham.
- I'm not repressed, Tom.

32:00.140 --> 32:02.783
I just don't want to see your knob
first thing in the morning.

32:02.784 --> 32:04.827
<i>- I already feel sick.
-  Yeah, sick with envy.</i>

32:04.828 --> 32:09.510
 Oh, yeah

32:09.511 --> 32:11.512
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

32:11.513 --> 32:15.156
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

32:15.157 --> 32:17.198
Look, it's totally understandable,
Graham,

32:17.199 --> 32:18.925
for you to wish
you had a body like mine.

32:18.926 --> 32:21.482
Oh, yeah, I really wish
I looked like a big ginger spider.

32:21.483 --> 32:23.885
I've got a low centre of gravity
which is quite handy

- What's the matter?

32:34.899 --> 32:37.586
I think I must have picked it up
from Ray's by mistake.

32:39.503 --> 32:41.625
Are you completely fucked in the head,
Graham?

32:41.626 --> 32:43.512
You don't steal drugs
from a guy like Ray.

32:43.513 --> 32:45.396
I didn't steal it, Tom,
it was an accident.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.950
What kind of a bell end takes a bag
of cocaine by accident?

32:47.951 --> 32:49.592
GRAHAM: Oh, my God.

32:49.593 --> 32:52.955
We're dead. He's gonna beat us
to death with the iron.

32:52.956 --> 32:55.118
What do you mean, we?
I didn't steal his stash.

32:55.119 --> 32:59.123
Well, he's your dealer. I didn't
wanna go there in the first place!

32:59.124 --> 33:01.405
Oh, my God, Tom.

33:01.406 --> 33:03.057
<i>-  You have to take it back.
- What?</i>

33:06.131 --> 33:08.694
<i>- You alright, mate?
-  I'm fine, yeah.</i>

33:08.695 --> 33:11.175
<i>- Sorted out that sheep yet?
-  Pretty much, yeah.</i>

33:11.176 --> 33:14.258
Good. I can't afford
any fuck-ups today, OK?

33:14.259 --> 33:18.102
Yeah, uh, talking about that, I think
me and Graham might need to nip off

33:18.103 --> 33:19.583
just for an hour or so.

33:19.584 --> 33:21.956
<i>- What?
-  We got something we need to do...</i>

33:21.957 --> 33:24.549
If you leave me today,
I swear I'll never speak to you again.

33:24.550 --> 33:26.352
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, no problem.

33:29.796 --> 33:31.325
You look great.

33:32.479 --> 33:33.527
(sighs)

33:36.523 --> 33:38.084
<i>- Well?
-  It's a no-go.</i>

33:38.085 --> 33:39.084
Oh...

33:39.085 --> 33:41.286
We'll have to take it back
first thing tomorrow

33:41.287 --> 33:43.489
and explain what happened.
Ray'll understand.

33:43.490 --> 33:46.173
<i>- He's a reasonable man.
-  He's a very unreasonable man, Tom!</i>

33:46.174 --> 33:48.775
Did you hear what he said
about smashing people's kneecaps

33:48.776 --> 33:50.216
with household appliances?

33:50.217 --> 33:54.461
Shut up! Does that look like
reasonable behaviour to you, Tom?

33:54.462 --> 33:56.943
<i>-  Not what you're showing me, no.
- You should call him.</i>

33:56.944 --> 33:59.988
<i>- Fuck off! -  Just say
we'll bring the bag tomorrow.</i>

33:59.989 --> 34:02.313
Why don't you give him a call?
You're the one he likes.

34:02.314 --> 34:05.357
Because I'll fuck it up. You know
I will. I'll say something stupid.

34:07.035 --> 34:08.804
You're such a pain in the arse!

34:10.839 --> 34:12.920
- Got no reception.
- Please try.

34:12.922 --> 34:14.563
You owe me for this.

34:14.563 --> 34:16.083
 Ooh la la la

34:16.085 --> 34:19.567
 Oh, I've got a brand-new pair
of roller skates

34:19.568 --> 34:22.780
 You got a brand-new key. 

34:24.654 --> 34:27.975
Ah, you look like
a really beautiful meringue.

34:27.976 --> 34:30.108
(Laughs) Don't make me laugh,
I can't breathe.

34:32.021 --> 34:35.664
<i>- Something old.
-  Oh, Mum, not your lucky coin.</i>

34:35.665 --> 34:37.194
BARBARA: You might need it.

34:38.148 --> 34:41.311
Hello, Ray?
Yeah, it's terrible reception.

34:41.312 --> 34:43.638
<i>- It's an answering machine.
-  Leave a message.</i>

34:43.639 --> 34:46.116
<i>- Can you just step back a bit?
PHONE: ..after the beep.</i>

34:46.116 --> 34:48.158
Yeah, hi, Ray. It's Tom and Graham.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.639
Listen, we hate to tell you this
but we've got your coke.

34:50.641 --> 34:53.043
- Tell him it was a mistake.
- It was a mistake of course.

34:53.043 --> 34:55.054
<i>-  And we'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Shut up.</i>

34:55.054 --> 34:56.525
<i>- Alright.
-  Not you, Ray.</i>

34:56.525 --> 34:58.529
That was Graham
being a shithead as usual.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.331
Anyway, we're really sorry, man.
We'll bring it back tomorrow.

35:01.332 --> 35:03.658
<i>-  And hope we haven't caused any...
- Inconvenience.</i>

35:03.659 --> 35:05.698
..inconvenience
and have a great weekend.

35:06.979 --> 35:09.340
(Sighs) There, done.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.941
(Sighs) Cheers, mate.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.986
Now get dressed quickly,
we're gonna be late.

35:14.307 --> 35:17.595
My wedding suit.
I left it in the bag at Ray's.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.238
Oh, spoiled for choice.

35:26.239 --> 35:28.560
REPORTER: Political king maker
Jim Ramme

35:28.561 --> 35:31.763
<i>negotiates a different kind of coalition
today ...</i>

35:31.764 --> 35:35.488
the wedding of his daughter Mia,
or should that be Princess Mia,

35:35.489 --> 35:37.610
to David Locking.

35:37.611 --> 35:39.380
How's that? Crap?

35:47.901 --> 35:51.385
 This morning
I woke up with this feeling

35:51.386 --> 35:53.907
 I didn't know how to deal with

35:53.908 --> 35:57.551
 So I just decided to myself... 

35:57.552 --> 36:00.234
Borrow some ugg boots
if you're getting cold feet, Dave.

36:00.235 --> 36:03.116
Oh, Jim. Not at all.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.600
There's only one person
you got to impress here today.

36:05.601 --> 36:08.082
<i>- I know, Mi...
- Eddie Marshall.</i>

36:08.083 --> 36:09.645
Chief Party Whip.

36:09.646 --> 36:12.928
He's the last man standing between
you and your surprise wedding present.

36:12.929 --> 36:14.569
So why don't you slide over there

36:14.570 --> 36:17.334
and dazzle him with
some of your cheeky English charm?

36:19.616 --> 36:21.057
<i>(Belch)</i>

36:30.146 --> 36:32.307
<i>-  Hey, Luke.
- David.</i>

36:32.308 --> 36:34.030
<i>- You...
-  (Clears throat)</i>

36:34.031 --> 36:36.030
<i>- ..doing OK?
-  Yeah, I'm doing fine.</i>

36:36.031 --> 36:37.913
I'm really, really good.

36:37.914 --> 36:40.116
Never better.

36:40.117 --> 36:42.478
- Did you call Sarah again?
- Yeah.

36:42.479 --> 36:46.684
Uh, she said that she hates my guts
and that she wishes I were dead.

36:46.685 --> 36:48.244
Jesus, Luke.

36:48.245 --> 36:50.407
Look, Dave, please, come on,
look, it's fine.

36:50.407 --> 36:51.414
OK.

36:55.253 --> 36:57.294
You look like my Uncle Reggie
who's dead.

36:57.295 --> 36:59.577
Great! I look like a total idiot.

36:59.578 --> 37:01.858
Look at these sleeves, they're too long!

37:01.859 --> 37:04.065
<i>- Just keep your arms by your side.
-  What, all day?</i>

37:04.066 --> 37:05.543
I'll look like a fucking penguin.

37:05.544 --> 37:07.867
Oh, these are the itchiest trousers
I've ever worn.

37:07.868 --> 37:09.307
Seriously, it's unbearable.

37:09.308 --> 37:12.670
You're lucky you have any trousers
at all. Now, stop scratching your balls.

37:12.671 --> 37:14.352
Speaker of the House, Marion Bowers.

37:14.353 --> 37:16.635
And my old mate,
Commissioner Leo Marinetti.

37:16.636 --> 37:19.358
Commissioner Marinetti.
Nice to meet you all.

37:19.359 --> 37:22.801
- Any of your family joining you, David?
BARBARA: David lost his family.

37:22.802 --> 37:25.285
<i>-  But he has us now.
JIM: Well, almost.</i>

37:25.286 --> 37:28.447
So we'll count his friends as family
until then.

37:28.448 --> 37:30.688
It's a very important thing, family.

37:30.689 --> 37:32.971
<i>-  You need to appreciate them.
- Yeah.</i>

37:32.972 --> 37:35.855
Even when the maid of honour
turns into the best man?

37:35.856 --> 37:37.255
DAPHNE: Ouch.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.103
COMMISSIONER:
That's families for you.

37:39.104 --> 37:42.221
When they're no longer around to
drive you bonkers, you wish they were.

37:42.222 --> 37:44.464
But by then it's too late.

37:44.465 --> 37:46.426
All you're left with are regrets

37:46.427 --> 37:48.429
Memories.

37:48.430 --> 37:50.110
Wasted years.

37:50.111 --> 37:52.392
Excuse me a minute.

37:52.393 --> 37:53.754
I look bloody mental!

37:53.754 --> 37:56.837
What kind of grenade takes his luggage
into a drug dealer's anyway?

37:56.838 --> 37:58.798
Tom! You made us go there
in the first place!

37:58.799 --> 38:00.360
Excuse me. Graham!

38:00.361 --> 38:04.005
<i>- What the hell are you wearing?
-  I forgot my suit, had to borrow this.</i>

38:04.006 --> 38:06.366
 VIVALDI: La Primavera

38:06.367 --> 38:08.137
- Oh, God, this is it.
- Bloody hell.

38:08.138 --> 38:11.973
Before I forget, Tom,
my wedding present for Mia.

38:11.974 --> 38:13.701
What, a mobile phone? That's romantic.

38:13.702 --> 38:16.177
A video. Just before my speech,
plug it into the monitor,

38:16.178 --> 38:17.619
hit play when I give the word.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.585
<i>- Got it.
-  You got that sheep back, yeah?</i>

38:19.586 --> 38:21.182
Oh, no! l forgot.

38:21.183 --> 38:23.465
<i>- How did you forget?
-  There's a lot going on, David.</i>

38:23.466 --> 38:26.267
Just make sure you deal with it
straight after the ceremony, OK?

38:26.268 --> 38:28.630
(Luke laughs)

38:28.631 --> 38:31.034
- Oh, Jesus, we've lost Luke.
- Oh, God.

38:31.035 --> 38:33.476
<i>(Luke laughs hysterically)
-  What the fuck is he doing?</i>

38:33.477 --> 38:36.198
Alright, we'll deal with him.
Graham, stick him in the car.

38:36.199 --> 38:38.046
<i>- What? Why me?
-  I'm taking care of David.</i>

38:38.047 --> 38:39.407
(sighs)

38:44.768 --> 38:47.291
<i>- Let's do this.
-  Right behind you, brother.</i>

38:48.972 --> 38:51.334
<i>(Luke laughs)
-  What are you doing?</i>

38:51.335 --> 38:52.856
Ah!

38:52.857 --> 38:55.588
Jesus, Luke!
How much have you drunk?

39:03.990 --> 39:05.310
(Plays violin)

39:05.311 --> 39:07.231
<i>-  Here you go, the ring.
DAVID: Thanks.</i>

39:07.232 --> 39:10.115
<i>(Camera clicks)</i>

39:10.116 --> 39:12.245
 Pachelbel's Canon

39:29.416 --> 39:32.146
 The Wedding March

39:34.101 --> 39:35.826
Here we go.

39:56.965 --> 39:58.932
(Daphne plays violin very badly)

40:01.931 --> 40:03.776
<i>(clapping)</i>

40:05.013 --> 40:09.857
Dearly beloved, when someone puts
a ring on the finger of another,

40:09.858 --> 40:13.020
they pronounce, Now you are mine

40:13.021 --> 40:16.784
That act of possession
removes mystery

40:16.785 --> 40:20.029
and marks the end of a relationship,
not the beginning,

40:20.030 --> 40:24.954
because real wisdom
does not try to own love,

40:24.955 --> 40:27.196
doesn't try to control it

40:27.197 --> 40:30.279
but simply stands in awe and says,

40:30.280 --> 40:33.086
I love you

40:36.326 --> 40:38.292
 Rock music

40:39.730 --> 40:42.973
David, please place the ring
on Mia's finger.

40:44.055 --> 40:46.856
 Rock music

40:46.857 --> 40:49.305
Mia, please place the ring
on David's finger.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.143
 Rock music

40:53.266 --> 40:56.946
Mia, do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband...

40:56.947 --> 40:58.349
 Rock music

40:58.350 --> 40:59.909
..to have and to hold...

..in sickness and in health...

41:02.639 --> 41:03.754
 Rock music

41:03.755 --> 41:05.240
- ..till death do you part?
- I do.

41:05.241 --> 41:07.202
 Rock music

41:08.440 --> 41:11.202
And, David, do you take this woman

41:11.203 --> 41:13.050
to be your lawful wedded wife...

41:15.567 --> 41:17.290
..to have and to hold...

41:17.291 --> 41:18.771
Ah!

41:18.772 --> 41:20.453
..in sickness and in health

41:20.454 --> 41:22.454
till death do you part?

41:22.455 --> 41:23.935
I do.

41:23.936 --> 41:25.138
GUESTS: Ooh! Oof!

41:25.139 --> 41:26.779
By the power vested in me,

41:26.780 --> 41:30.302
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

41:30.303 --> 41:32.985
<i>-  You may now kiss the bride.
- Ball!</i>

41:32.986 --> 41:34.867
Massive ball!

41:34.868 --> 41:36.912
(Screaming)

41:46.720 --> 41:50.604
JIM: Well, I promised you a ball
and boy, didn't I deliver?

41:50.605 --> 41:53.486
So, into the marquee.
Uh, put your drinks on my tab.

41:53.487 --> 41:55.970
Let's get this Liberal Party started,
eh?

41:55.971 --> 41:57.491
Are you OK?

41:57.492 --> 42:00.415
Two feet to the right and Eddie Marshall
would have been flattened

42:00.416 --> 42:01.896
by a runaway flower arrangement.

42:01.897 --> 42:03.621
He always comes up smelling of roses!

42:03.622 --> 42:04.744
That is not helping!

42:04.745 --> 42:07.702
- It's probably just a sprain.
- Mia, I am so sorry.

42:07.703 --> 42:10.386
David, don't worry about it, honestly.

42:10.387 --> 42:13.267
Look on the bright side, we'll
probably be a YouTube sensation.

42:13.268 --> 42:14.390
Great!

42:14.390 --> 42:16.350
- Oh, easy, easy, easy.
- Mine, it's mine.

42:16.351 --> 42:17.352
Luke!

42:17.353 --> 42:19.635
- We're almost there.
- (Clears throat)

42:19.636 --> 42:21.757
Uh, Jim.

42:21.758 --> 42:25.560
<i>-  I am so, so sorry.
- For what?</i>

42:25.561 --> 42:28.443
Your best man playing skittles
with the Australian parliament?

42:28.444 --> 42:31.569
You had better go and tell your mates
to pull their thick heads in, Dave.

42:35.893 --> 42:37.061
Eddie!

42:39.736 --> 42:43.180
Aah! So sorry, man.
Don't know what happened.

42:43.180 --> 42:45.902
You drank three bottles of champagne,
that's what happened.

42:45.903 --> 42:47.864
I was loosening up
for the best man's speech

42:47.865 --> 42:49.666
which is under control.

42:49.667 --> 42:52.629
(Reads) By the way,
congratulations to David and Mia...

42:52.630 --> 42:54.192
OK, you don't have to do it now.

42:54.193 --> 42:55.873
I'm so glad that you found a woman

42:55.874 --> 42:58.477
<i>- Don't peak too early.
-  Told you it should have been me.</i>

42:58.478 --> 43:00.246
(Reads) ..acting like a filthy whore.

43:00.247 --> 43:02.249
That was rubbish.

43:03.522 --> 43:05.361
(Sighs) My God, they must hate me.

43:05.362 --> 43:07.405
TOM: Of course they don't hate you.
Who could?

43:07.406 --> 43:08.935
GRAHAM: Shit.

43:09.889 --> 43:12.610
Whoa, leave her alone, leave her alone.
Put her down.

43:12.611 --> 43:14.982
We're gonna need to rethink
the best man's speech.

43:14.982 --> 43:16.655
I'll take care of it.

43:18.136 --> 43:20.058
Stop it. Sony.

43:20.059 --> 43:23.142
 Love

43:23.143 --> 43:27.032
 Exciting and new

43:27.988 --> 43:29.714
 Come aboard

43:31.391 --> 43:32.872
 We're expecting

43:32.873 --> 43:34.719
Sorry, I've got really itchy trousers.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.356
Oh, you can play with your balls
till you're blue in the face,

43:37.357 --> 43:38.525
it doesn't bother me.

43:40.041 --> 43:42.201
- I really like your outfit.
- You do?

43:42.202 --> 43:45.250
It's a really nice... outfit.

43:46.607 --> 43:48.569
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna wear a dress.

43:48.570 --> 43:51.412
Even if these pants
do ride up my bum crack.

43:51.413 --> 43:53.775
Here you are, mate...

43:53.776 --> 43:55.417
Well, I'd happily swap, you know.

43:55.418 --> 43:58.499
I'll wear those trousers
and you can wear the itchy...

43:58.500 --> 44:01.222
- Listen, can I borrow you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

44:01.223 --> 44:03.464
- This is Daphne, Mia's sister.
- Hi, Dorothy.

44:03.465 --> 44:05.265
You can have him back in a minute.

44:05.266 --> 44:09.070
Wait, Tom, did you have to drag me
away like that? I was doing really well.

44:09.071 --> 44:10.752
Come on now, it's never gonna happen.

44:10.753 --> 44:12.153
Why not?

44:12.154 --> 44:14.076
For one thing,
you're in an old man's suit.

44:14.077 --> 44:15.677
Plus, she's a lesbian.

44:15.678 --> 44:17.680
Yeah? Well, I thought
maybe I could turn her.

44:17.681 --> 44:20.963
Don't be ridiculous. You won't turn
a muff-muncher. Even I'd find it hard.

44:20.964 --> 44:24.206
Listen, you're gonna have to take care
of the best man's speech.

44:24.207 --> 44:26.328
- Right.
- Great.

44:26.329 --> 44:28.611
Sorry, what do you mean by
‘take care of the speech‘?

44:28.612 --> 44:30.894
You have to do the speech,
they'll call you in five.

44:30.895 --> 44:32.294
- Right.
- Good.

44:32.295 --> 44:33.978
- Sorry, one quick question.
- What?

44:33.979 --> 44:37.100
Are you out of your fucking mind?
A speech in front of all these people?

44:37.101 --> 44:39.783
<i>- I don't have my material.
-  I thought you wanted this!</i>

44:39.784 --> 44:41.825
I don't want it thrust on me
at the last minute!

44:41.826 --> 44:43.827
<i>-  Just make something up!
- I can't, Tom.</i>

44:43.828 --> 44:45.913
<i>-  You make something up.
- Listen to me, Graham.</i>

44:45.914 --> 44:47.831
David needs you,
this is his wedding day.

44:47.832 --> 44:50.714
So step up and take some responsibility
for once in your life.

44:50.715 --> 44:54.957
I'm the one who called Ray,
you're the one who's doing the speech.

44:54.958 --> 44:57.482
And don't worry, I'll give you a hand.

44:59.524 --> 45:01.486
I didn't ruin your wedding day, did I?

45:01.487 --> 45:04.528
<i>- Well... -  You know
I love you so much, dude.</i>

45:04.529 --> 45:06.015
Love you too.

45:07.373 --> 45:11.177
You know, if you had a vagina,
I'd probably have sex with you.

45:11.177 --> 45:14.260
Actually, I think I'd have sex with you
even if you didn't have a 'gina

45:14.260 --> 45:16.822
just to show you what a good friend
I think you are.

45:16.823 --> 45:20.465
That won't be necessary,
but good to know.

45:20.466 --> 45:22.268
Now go to bed and sleep it off, OK?

45:26.994 --> 45:28.515
(sighs)

45:28.516 --> 45:30.481
<i>(Bleating)</i>

45:33.321 --> 45:35.842
<i>-  I... don't know what to say.
- Stop.</i>

45:35.843 --> 45:38.366
We did it. We're married.

45:43.491 --> 45:46.493
I thought the best thing that's ever
happened to me was about to be...

45:46.494 --> 45:47.975
Bowled off a cliff?

45:47.976 --> 45:49.745
I don't ever want to lose you, Mia.

45:49.746 --> 45:51.738
Ah, you got me on a beach in Tuvalu.

45:51.739 --> 45:54.302
And guess what,
now you're stuck with me.

45:54.302 --> 46:00.027
Ladies and gentlemen, please vote one
for Mia and Dave Locking-Ramme.

46:00.028 --> 46:02.431
<i>(clapping)</i>

46:02.432 --> 46:04.398
Mr Locking.

46:05.594 --> 46:07.035
Mrs Locking.

46:07.036 --> 46:08.401
Shall we?

46:10.438 --> 46:13.290
 The Wedding March

46:14.804 --> 46:17.686
The rest of the day is gonna be perfect,
I promise you.

46:17.687 --> 46:19.848
I'll get it, Ray.
I swear, just a few more days.

46:19.849 --> 46:22.291
RAY: What do you think I am,
a bloody clown?

46:22.292 --> 46:25.174
Eh? Do I look like a clown? Do I?

46:25.175 --> 46:26.897
<i>-  Excuse me, Ray.
- What?</i>

46:26.898 --> 46:28.898
There's a message
on the answering machine.

46:28.899 --> 46:30.385
I think you might wanna hear it.

46:32.302 --> 46:34.189
<i>MACHINE: Hi, Ray.
It's Tom and Graham...</i>

46:34.190 --> 46:35.190
<i>(Static)</i>

46:35.191 --> 46:36.826
<i>We hate... you.</i>

46:36.827 --> 46:38.508
<i>(Static)</i>

46:38.509 --> 46:41.071
<i>We've got your coke... shithead.
(Static)</i>

46:41.072 --> 46:42.841
<i>Have a great weekend.</i>

46:49.762 --> 46:51.802
Fuck! Fuck!

46:51.803 --> 46:55.366
He's stolen my drugs!
He's stolen my bloody drugs!

46:55.367 --> 46:57.808
I trusted the little bastard!

46:57.809 --> 47:00.290
You little prick!
I'm gonna string him up!

47:00.291 --> 47:02.573
I'm gonna hang him up
by the fucking balls!

47:02.574 --> 47:05.857
Ray, it's a wedding invitation.

47:05.858 --> 47:08.021
Get the fucking keys.

47:09.302 --> 47:12.223
Can't believe it.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.

47:12.224 --> 47:14.346
What am I gonna say?

47:14.347 --> 47:17.911
Why not say something about how we're
surprised David's getting married

47:17.912 --> 47:20.553
because when we first met him,
we totally assumed he was gay?

47:20.554 --> 47:22.355
Oh, yeah, yeah, good one.

47:22.356 --> 47:24.757
It's a best man's speech,
it's supposed to be funny.

47:24.758 --> 47:28.000
Have you been out there? I don't think
that's the right audience for this.

47:28.001 --> 47:29.202
They are.

47:29.203 --> 47:32.565
What if I say something about Australia
being England's old penal colony?

47:32.566 --> 47:34.892
You know, something like that,
something relevant.

47:34.893 --> 47:38.132
Why not throw in they're a nation
of in-bred pointy-headed sheep fuckers

47:38.133 --> 47:39.573
who think culture is yoghurt?

47:39.573 --> 47:41.977
Well, if you're so good,
let's see what you've done.

47:43.499 --> 47:46.220
- Oh, great, you've drawn some tits!
- (Laughs)

47:46.221 --> 47:48.303
Thanks, Tom!
You're supposed to be helping me!

47:48.304 --> 47:51.025
I am helping you!
I told you to do the gay thing.

47:51.026 --> 47:52.546
I'm not doing the gay thing.

47:52.547 --> 47:54.989
<i> Then I knew
 I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew</i>

47:54.990 --> 47:57.480
 She could make me happy... 

47:59.994 --> 48:01.756
- Jim.
- Yes, dear.

48:01.757 --> 48:04.083
What is Eddie Marshall doing
at the bridal table?

48:05.602 --> 48:07.682
That's odd, there must be
some sort of mistake.

48:07.683 --> 48:11.408
Maureen doesn't make mistakes.
Last chance to come clean, dear.

48:12.689 --> 48:15.611
You know how you're always going on
about me never being home?

48:15.612 --> 48:19.855
- When do I go on about it?
- Well, I'm retiring.

48:19.856 --> 48:21.938
That's right,
I'm going to throw in the towel.

48:21.939 --> 48:24.419
And with Eddie's blessing,
I'm gonna give my seat to Mia.

48:24.420 --> 48:26.103
Is that what Mia wants?

48:27.303 --> 48:29.866
- Have you even asked her?
- I don't have to.

48:29.867 --> 48:31.429
<i>-  Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.</i>

48:31.430 --> 48:33.509
<i>It's a surprise -
my wedding present.</i>

48:33.510 --> 48:35.641
It's not your wedding, Jim!

48:38.396 --> 48:39.917
(Grunts in anger)

48:39.918 --> 48:41.720
Such a lovely day to be here today.

48:42.839 --> 48:46.763
It's such a lovely day to be here...
Oh, Christ! I'm getting the jitters.

48:46.764 --> 48:48.567
Don't think
I can go through with this.

48:48.568 --> 48:50.052
Yeah, thought this might happen.

48:52.050 --> 48:54.652
<i>- Is that Ray's coke?
-  It's just one, he'll never notice.</i>

48:54.653 --> 48:57.455
Are you off your nut?!
We've got to give it all back!

48:57.456 --> 49:00.177
I've got to do a speech!
I can't do drugs!

49:00.178 --> 49:03.702
What shit are you talking, Graham?
This will give you a bit of confidence.

49:03.703 --> 49:05.504
<i>- Really?
-  Absolutely. Come on.</i>

49:15.475 --> 49:16.915
Isn't that a bit much?

49:16.916 --> 49:19.287
You need to do a lot
otherwise it won't have an impact.

49:19.288 --> 49:20.885
Come on, before someone comes.

49:24.485 --> 49:27.647
<i>- Good afternoon, Barbara.
-  What in the hell is going on?</i>

49:27.648 --> 49:30.690
<i>Uh, we just... We, um...</i>

49:30.691 --> 49:32.177
Is that cocaine?

49:33.933 --> 49:35.214
Yeah.

49:35.215 --> 49:38.984
Well, don't just stand there gawping.
Line ‘em up!

49:45.586 --> 49:49.269
You could desalinate your soil by
replacing wheat with mallee scrub

49:49.270 --> 49:52.793
and that'll earn you big CER bucks
into the UN trade subsidy.

49:52.794 --> 49:54.435
Excuse me.

49:54.436 --> 49:57.918
- David.
- Wow. That sounded impressive.

49:57.919 --> 50:00.362
Four years of political science
will do that to you.

50:00.363 --> 50:04.285
<i>- I thought you did sociology.
-  No, majored in Conflict Resolution.</i>

50:04.286 --> 50:06.248
Very useful in my family.

50:06.249 --> 50:08.891
And your psychology degree
is going to come in handy.

50:08.892 --> 50:11.012
<i>-  Physics.
- What?</i>

50:11.013 --> 50:14.859
<i>- I did physics.
-  Oh. Of course you did.</i>

50:17.700 --> 50:20.223
Oh, I knew he wasn't going
to let go easily

50:20.224 --> 50:22.905
but this one really takes the biscuit.

50:22.906 --> 50:25.668
Gotta say, didn't have you pegged
as a party girl, Barbara.

50:25.669 --> 50:27.509
Oh, last couple on the dance floor

50:27.510 --> 50:29.791
until Jim became
this right-wing maniac.

50:29.792 --> 50:31.754
Now look at him - retiring!

50:31.755 --> 50:34.238
Giving up his seat for his daughter.

50:34.239 --> 50:36.319
Try forcing it down her throat

50:36.320 --> 50:38.722
You can mess with me -
that's one thing...

50:38.723 --> 50:40.203
but mess with my kids?

50:40.204 --> 50:41.925
No way, Jose, that's it!

50:41.926 --> 50:43.647
End of the road!

50:43.648 --> 50:46.649
<i>- Your turn, Graham.
-  I'm alright, thanks.</i>

50:46.650 --> 50:48.813
Don't be such a wuss.

50:48.814 --> 50:51.336
Meow! Meow!
Don't be such a pussy, come on.

50:53.218 --> 50:55.619
<i>- (Laughs) Pussy.
-  (Barbara meows)</i>

50:55.620 --> 50:58.262
 Howzat? 

50:58.263 --> 50:59.904
Eddie's going cold.

50:59.905 --> 51:02.748
Christ! Now what do we do?
Barbara's gone AWOL.

51:02.748 --> 51:06.277
Right! Now I'm really
going to enjoy myself.

51:13.559 --> 51:15.001
(Laughs)

51:16.242 --> 51:19.364
It'd be quite bad, wouldn't it,
to try and shag David's mother-in-law?

51:19.365 --> 51:22.407
Of course it bloody would.
Shit, that coke‘s strong!

51:22.408 --> 51:24.330
- Completely fucked.
- I know.

51:24.331 --> 51:27.613
- I'm really wired.
- You told me to have loads.

51:27.614 --> 51:30.706
I think I may have been a bit gung-ho.

51:35.663 --> 51:39.913
So, Eddie,
has your third wife left you yet?

51:41.629 --> 51:44.111
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please take your seats?

51:44.112 --> 51:45.832
GRAHAM: I can't feel my face.

51:45.833 --> 51:49.556
..best man's toast to be delivered
by... Graham.

51:49.557 --> 51:51.478
<i>(Clapping)
- What?</i>

51:51.479 --> 51:53.402
Fuck! I'm not ready, Tom.

51:57.406 --> 51:59.888
Have you got the speech?

51:59.889 --> 52:01.331
Thanks.

52:12.021 --> 52:13.747
<i>(Silence)</i>

52:17.987 --> 52:20.069
Tits?

52:20.070 --> 52:21.599
Tits.

52:23.154 --> 52:24.514
Tits...

52:24.515 --> 52:26.556
'Tis a wonderful occasion.

52:26.557 --> 52:31.722
Uh, I must admit I was a bit worried
about coming to Australia at first.

52:31.723 --> 52:34.648
It being the country we sent
all our criminals to and everything.

52:36.206 --> 52:40.450
But Australia is no longer
just a penal colony

52:40.451 --> 52:42.773
for England's rapists and murderers.

52:42.774 --> 52:46.136
No, it's now a country in its own right.

52:46.137 --> 52:50.221
Or at least it was since you lot
stole all the land off the Aborigines.

52:50.222 --> 52:51.948
<i>(Silence)</i>

52:56.388 --> 52:59.991
Uh, I think I can speak
on behalf of all of us

52:59.992 --> 53:05.317
when I say that I'm very pleased to hear
that David's now married

53:05.318 --> 53:09.205
especially since at first
we all thought he was a homosexual.

53:10.603 --> 53:12.043
Homosexual.

53:12.044 --> 53:14.327
(Barbara chuckles)

53:14.328 --> 53:17.689
But hopefully, Mia, you haven't
just married one of those gays

53:17.690 --> 53:19.132
that's in denial for years

53:19.133 --> 53:22.055
and then you come home and
find him in bed shagging another man.

53:22.056 --> 53:27.099
Uh, but don't worry, Mia,
there are signs to look out for,

53:27.100 --> 53:30.062
like anal sex.

53:30.063 --> 53:32.385
<i>(Silence, stunned gasps)</i>

53:32.386 --> 53:34.707
Apparently,
if he's excessively into anal sex,

53:34.708 --> 53:38.761
then that's a sign,
so look out for that one.

53:42.438 --> 53:46.080
Um, I mean, it's fair enough
if it's just occasional, you know

53:46.081 --> 53:47.731
I mean, I'm sure that you've tried it.

53:47.732 --> 53:51.444
Most couples try it, don't they,
at some point?

53:51.445 --> 53:55.289
Uh, just... If you haven't tried it
and you are gonna try it this evening,

53:55.290 --> 53:57.891
then just go easy on each other,
don't whack it up dry,

53:57.892 --> 54:00.014
use some butter from the table
or something...

54:00.015 --> 54:01.857
Thank you, Graham.

54:01.858 --> 54:05.740
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bride and groom.

54:05.741 --> 54:07.343
<i>(Polite clapping)</i>

54:07.344 --> 54:08.873
JIM: Maestro!

54:10.626 --> 54:13.428
<i>-  Well, that was... That was...
- Awful?</i>

54:13.429 --> 54:17.192
Atrocious? Humiliating?
What the hell was he thinking?

54:17.193 --> 54:19.159
I don't know, David, he's your friend.

54:20.597 --> 54:23.158
David, are you a homosexual?
(Static)

54:23.159 --> 54:24.839
No, of course not.

54:24.840 --> 54:26.568
Because if you're doing this for a visa,

54:26.569 --> 54:28.765
the Minister for Immigration
is sitting there!

54:28.766 --> 54:31.127
I'm not gay, it was a joke.

54:31.128 --> 54:33.329
We'd better start laughing, then,
hadn't we, eh?

54:33.330 --> 54:35.292
(Jim laughs forcefully)

54:35.293 --> 54:36.974
(David laughs nervously)

54:36.975 --> 54:39.497
Fantastic! What I really loved
is you gave everyone here

54:39.498 --> 54:41.418
an image of David doing Mia
up the arse.

54:41.419 --> 54:43.500
You gave me the wrong piece of paper,
you moron.

54:43.501 --> 54:45.108
I was left with your picture of tits.

54:45.108 --> 54:47.386
- Shit, mate, is that what happened?
- Yes.

54:49.388 --> 54:51.588
David, I'm so sorry.

54:51.589 --> 54:54.232
I had the whole speech worked out
but when I got the paper out,

54:54.233 --> 54:57.114
it was just this picture of tits
and it just totally threw me.

54:57.115 --> 54:59.037
You need to apologise to Jim.

54:59.038 --> 55:01.720
- Do I have to?
- Yes!

55:01.721 --> 55:03.732
I think he's about to go
into cardiac arrest.

55:07.086 --> 55:09.528
(Car engine growls)

55:09.529 --> 55:11.495
KAL: I haven't been to a wedding
in years.

55:12.813 --> 55:15.534
Fucking little dead shit.

55:15.535 --> 55:17.497
I thought we had a connection.

55:17.498 --> 55:20.900
I even told him about my panic attacks.

55:20.901 --> 55:24.303
<i>- I'm gonna barge in there...
-  You can't barge in dressed like that.</i>

55:24.304 --> 55:26.866
Oh, I can barge wherever I fucking like.

55:26.867 --> 55:29.749
You want to go in there
and mess this guy up?

55:29.750 --> 55:31.670
You want everyone to recognise you?

55:31.672 --> 55:35.680
You got to blend in, dress nice.
It's a wedding.

55:45.046 --> 55:48.369
Barbara, could I have a word?

55:48.370 --> 55:51.462
Too many words, Jim,
not enough champagne.

55:53.135 --> 55:55.096
- (Jim chuckles nervously)
- Come on!

55:55.097 --> 55:57.588
Weddings. Women.

55:58.741 --> 56:01.423
- Crazy.
- Yes.

56:01.424 --> 56:05.267
Still, my girl's working the room
like a pro.

56:05.268 --> 56:07.829
EDDIE: You honestly think she's ready?

56:07.830 --> 56:11.794
There comes a moment in time
when the universe cries out...

56:11.795 --> 56:15.838
Jim, I just want to apologise
for before.

56:15.839 --> 56:18.321
You see, what I thought
was actually my speech

56:18.322 --> 56:21.044
actually turned out to be
this drawing of...

56:21.045 --> 56:23.486
Well, you can see what it is.

56:23.487 --> 56:25.208
It's tits.

56:25.209 --> 56:27.610
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

56:27.611 --> 56:30.414
Sorry? Hah! Come on!

56:30.415 --> 56:33.055
You'll have your own chat show
with a performance like that.

56:33.056 --> 56:34.457
You were a riot!

56:34.458 --> 56:38.511
It was really, really, really funny.

56:40.224 --> 56:42.355
You pull your head in, kid.

56:48.434 --> 56:51.355
<i>- Jim.
-  This is going pear-shaped.</i>

56:51.356 --> 56:53.478
Gotta do something fast
to turn this around.

56:53.479 --> 56:56.160
- Bump Ramsy ahead of schedule.
- Yes.

56:56.161 --> 56:59.164
Give me something strong, please.
Have you got a Molotov cocktail?

56:59.165 --> 57:02.687
Oh, no, a dirty martini, please
Yeah, times two.

57:02.688 --> 57:04.129
Thanks.

57:04.130 --> 57:07.854
That's got to go down as the worst toast
in the history of bad toasts.

57:07.855 --> 57:10.536
I don't know,
I thought it was pretty funny.

57:10.537 --> 57:13.819
Really? What,
even the bit about anal sex?

57:13.820 --> 57:16.303
Are you kidding?
That was, like, the best bit.

57:16.304 --> 57:18.263
<i>-  It's all anyone can talk about.
- Yeah?</i>

57:18.264 --> 57:19.744
Yeah.

57:19.745 --> 57:22.748
Yeah, well, I didn't wanna do
something boring, you know?

57:22.749 --> 57:24.671
 Sugar, Sugar

57:27.234 --> 57:29.355
Spruce him up, boys.
Full bells and whistles.

57:29.356 --> 57:31.487
We've got a Senate seat to save...

57:33.361 --> 57:37.044
- To lesbians.
- Amen to that, sister.

57:37.044 --> 57:38.650
Yeah. (Laughs)

57:42.211 --> 57:47.014
Hmm, there's something very sexy
about a man in uniform.

57:47.015 --> 57:49.697
Even sexier out of it. (Laughs)

57:49.698 --> 57:52.780
- What the hell are you doing?
- Dancing at my daughter's wedding

57:52.781 --> 57:55.463
- You? (Laughs)
- Jim, could I have a word?

57:55.464 --> 57:58.747
<i>-  It's important.
- Oh, I bet it is.</i>

57:58.748 --> 58:00.474
<i>- What is it?
-  It's Ramsy.</i>

58:00.475 --> 58:03.192
He's gone. I just went to check his pen
and he's not there.

58:03.193 --> 58:05.474
(Grumbles)

58:05.475 --> 58:08.162
<i>- Dad, what's wrong?
-  Ramsy is missing.</i>

58:12.721 --> 58:14.926
- I'll be back in a minute, yeah?
- You can't go now.

58:14.927 --> 58:16.650
They're about to call the bridal waltz.

58:16.651 --> 58:19.048
I'll be one minute, I promise.

58:19.049 --> 58:21.811
- However, I'm telling you...
- Where's Ramsy?

58:21.812 --> 58:24.253
- What?
- The sheep.

58:24.254 --> 58:26.216
- You didn't take it back, did you?
- Shit.

58:26.217 --> 58:28.178
Are you stupid in the mind?

58:28.179 --> 58:30.781
We need to get him back right now.
Excuse us.

58:30.782 --> 58:32.344
Oi... Uh, I just...

58:39.790 --> 58:41.757
I told you you'd need a suit!

58:46.158 --> 58:47.559
Get fucked.

58:47.560 --> 58:48.608
Boys.

58:50.962 --> 58:52.924
(Squeals and laughs)

58:52.925 --> 58:56.168
<i>- Hi!
-  Oh, Mum, you're drunk?</i>

58:56.169 --> 58:59.816
Not at all, darling.
I just had a shitload of coke.

59:06.659 --> 59:08.581
TOM: I left him in here, I swear.

59:10.424 --> 59:12.104
Luke? Luke!

59:12.105 --> 59:15.187
- Have you seen Ramsy?
- Who's Ramsy?

59:15.188 --> 59:18.551
<i>- The sheep. The sheep I left in here.
-  I don't know any sheep.</i>

59:18.552 --> 59:21.475
I've gotta go and do the bridal waltz.
I'll be back in five minutes.

59:21.476 --> 59:22.918
You'd better have found him.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.920
Sorry. I need your help, Leo.

59:27.921 --> 59:32.646
- Somebody's stolen my sheep.
- Who? The caterers?

59:32.647 --> 59:34.416
I'm serious, Commissioner.

59:36.330 --> 59:38.051
Alright, Jim.

59:38.052 --> 59:41.975
 Slow-motion weekdays stare me down

59:41.976 --> 59:45.740
 Her lipstick reflex got me wound... 

59:45.741 --> 59:49.344
- What does it look like?
- It's covered in wool and it bleats.

59:49.345 --> 59:51.147
What do you think it looks like, Luke?

59:51.148 --> 59:52.708
Aah!

59:57.954 --> 59:59.513
- Oh, my God.
- What?

59:59.514 --> 01:00:01.284
- Most of the drugs are missing.
- Huh?

01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:04.359
Ramsy‘s eaten them all.
Ramsy, you idiot!

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.683
Ray's gonna hurt us really bad.
What are we gonna do?

01:00:07.684 --> 01:00:10.085
<i>-  Laxatives.
- What?</i>

01:00:10.086 --> 01:00:13.729
Give it a load of laxatives,
maybe it'll shit it out.

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:15.091
Yes.

01:00:15.092 --> 01:00:16.531
GRAHAM: Yes.

01:00:16.532 --> 01:00:18.175
Yes.

01:00:18.176 --> 01:00:19.901
Yes, thank you.

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.302
And now, ladies and gentlemen
a father's dream come true...

01:00:26.303 --> 01:00:29.667
his daughter dancing the bridal waltz.

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.749
<i>(clapping)</i>

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:36.956
a, la, la, la, la, la, la

01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:41.880
a, la, la, la, la, la, la

01:00:41.881 --> 01:00:44.242
You alright? You're dripping with sweat.

01:00:44.243 --> 01:00:47.324
- No, yeah, I'm fine. You?
- Oh, great.

01:00:47.325 --> 01:00:49.526
Apart from the fact I lost my husband,

01:00:49.527 --> 01:00:51.609
Dad's lost Ramsy
and Mum's lost the plot.

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.691
- Did your friends give her coke?
- What?!

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:56.014
Of course not.
Who would they get coke from?

01:00:56.015 --> 01:00:58.657
Come on, come on.

01:00:58.658 --> 01:01:00.539
Come on, eat it!

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.140
Oh! For God's sake!

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:05.544
He'll eat a load of drug-filled condoms
but he won't eat 50 laxatives!

01:01:05.545 --> 01:01:09.028
- Oh, my God! We are dead.
- Shut up, Graham!

01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:10.394
<i>(Far?)
- Hang on.</i>

01:01:10.395 --> 01:01:12.191
I think he's done something.

01:01:13.192 --> 01:01:15.153
- (Tom gasps)
- Yes!

01:01:15.154 --> 01:01:18.038
<i>-  We've got one.
- Yes!</i>

01:01:21.081 --> 01:01:23.042
Have you seen Jim's sheep?

01:01:23.043 --> 01:01:26.246
(Man laughs)

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:28.008
Come on! It's no good.

01:01:28.009 --> 01:01:29.971
He's not shitting them out quick enough.

01:01:29.972 --> 01:01:32.134
- You know what I'm thinking, Graham?
- No, what?

01:01:32.135 --> 01:01:35.135
I'm thinking you're gonna have
to stick your hand up his arse.

01:01:35.137 --> 01:01:36.216
Sorry?

01:01:36.217 --> 01:01:39.299
I said, I'm thinking you're gonna have
to stick your hand up his arse.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.061
Yes, I heard what you said.
I just can't believe you said it.

01:01:42.062 --> 01:01:43.865
Well, there's no other option, is there?

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.826
How else are we gonna get
the drugs back?

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.989
OK, let's just be absolutely clear
on something

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:49.511
so there's no misunderstanding.

01:01:49.512 --> 01:01:51.833
I'm not sticking my hand
up anything's arse!

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.114
(Bleats)

01:01:53.115 --> 01:01:56.398
And that's fine, Graham, but you're
the one who's gonna have to tell Ray

01:01:56.399 --> 01:01:58.921
that we were gonna give him
his drugs back but not any more

01:01:58.922 --> 01:02:00.647
because they've been eaten by a sheep!

01:02:02.326 --> 01:02:03.645
Shit!

01:02:03.646 --> 01:02:04.605
Whoo!

01:02:04.606 --> 01:02:06.929
Oh, God, look at her.
She's off her tits.

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.571
(Laughs hysterically)

01:02:09.572 --> 01:02:11.654
I really need to go to the toilet.

01:02:11.655 --> 01:02:13.617
- Are you doing coke, David?
- No!

01:02:13.618 --> 01:02:15.824
I'll be back in two minutes.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:26.951
Ugh!

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:29.472
Come on, Graham, don't pussy about.
Get stuck in.

01:02:29.473 --> 01:02:31.634
It's no good, Tom,
I can't get good purchase.

01:02:31.635 --> 01:02:33.917
Oh, hang on.

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:35.645
- I think I've found something.
- Yeah?

01:02:35.646 --> 01:02:37.160
<i>(Silence)</i>

01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:39.484
What the fuck is going on?!

01:02:39.485 --> 01:02:41.210
It's not what it looks like.

01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:48.774
- You've got five seconds, Graham.
- What, me? Uh, well...

01:02:48.775 --> 01:02:50.696
Now, don't panic, David.

01:02:50.697 --> 01:02:52.137
It's too late, I'm afraid, Tom!

01:02:52.138 --> 01:02:54.819
I'm already
in major nuclear fucking panic mode!

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.542
<i>- What's that?
-  That's nothing to worry about.</i>

01:02:57.543 --> 01:02:59.944
That's just some condoms
with some cocaine in it.

01:02:59.945 --> 01:03:01.546
A condom with cocaine in it?

01:03:01.547 --> 01:03:03.677
Graham stole it from the guy
who sold us the weed.

01:03:03.678 --> 01:03:05.352
I didn't steal it, I took it by mistake.

01:03:05.353 --> 01:03:07.754
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
this can't be happening.

01:03:07.755 --> 01:03:09.795
This is my wedding day.

01:03:09.796 --> 01:03:12.120
It's supposed to be
the most memorable day of my life!

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.889
- Probably is in a way.
(Both chuckle)

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.121
Just calm down, OK?

01:03:16.122 --> 01:03:18.565
I know this looks bad but it's fixable.

01:03:18.566 --> 01:03:20.686
<i>- How?
-  Well, first things first.</i>

01:03:20.687 --> 01:03:23.058
We've got to get those drugs
out of that sheep's arse.

01:03:30.337 --> 01:03:32.660
You're Barry Gribble's son, right?

01:03:32.661 --> 01:03:34.462
Yeah, how's your dad?

01:03:36.465 --> 01:03:38.790
Haven't seen my dad
since Kentucky Fried Chicken.

01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:45.513
Now you're doing it.
Squeeze, squeeze it like a sturgeon.

01:03:45.514 --> 01:03:48.115
<i>- What the fuck are you talking about?
-  It's a fishing term.</i>

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.597
Here comes another one.

01:03:49.598 --> 01:03:51.279
Oh!

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.161
Sorry, busy in here.
Shouldn't have had the curry prawns.

01:03:54.162 --> 01:03:56.129
MAN: My tie, it's stuck.

01:03:57.566 --> 01:03:59.849
Excuse me, I said my tie is...

01:04:04.293 --> 01:04:06.896
TOM: OK, now, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle the gonads

01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:08.940
so we get some bonus secretions.

01:04:12.742 --> 01:04:14.705
(Laughs) Having a good time, girls?

01:04:14.706 --> 01:04:17.026
Great! Except my husband
keeps going missing.

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:19.510
Oh, married life -
get used to it, darling.

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:22.872
Uh, Mum, I think it's time for
one of your special night-night pills.

01:04:22.873 --> 01:04:26.396
Push! Push! You can do it, Ramsy!
Push!

01:04:26.397 --> 01:04:28.197
Oh! Oh!

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:30.165
<i>- I think that's the last one.
-  Are you sure?</i>

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.722
<i>- Yeah, I think so.
-  Alright, good.</i>

01:04:32.723 --> 01:04:34.766
Now get him back down
to the Old House.

01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:38.339
D'you mind if I wash my hands first?
They're covered in sheep shit.

01:04:46.178 --> 01:04:50.622
Uh, Luke, what's that you're holding?

01:04:50.623 --> 01:04:52.904
I don't think I can go on, David.

01:04:52.905 --> 01:04:55.627
Are you fucking kidding?
Are you fucking kidding me?!

01:04:55.628 --> 01:04:57.109
Sorry.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.071
I don't have a choice.

01:04:59.072 --> 01:05:01.552
Just... Hold on a second, Luke.

01:05:01.553 --> 01:05:03.956
And think about what you're doing.

01:05:05.518 --> 01:05:08.403
All I can think about is her
all the time.

01:05:09.402 --> 01:05:11.533
Her and that dick-less wonder.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.011
Do you guys have any idea what it's like

01:05:17.012 --> 01:05:20.222
to think about your ex-girlfriend
having sex with a man without a penis?

01:05:22.257 --> 01:05:25.184
Well, you don't know for sure
that he doesn't have one.

01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:28.347
You said so yourself.
It's just a rumour.

01:05:28.348 --> 01:05:30.824
To be fair, I did hear it
from a pretty reliable source.

01:05:30.825 --> 01:05:32.506
BOTH: Shut up, Tom.
(Sobs)

01:05:32.507 --> 01:05:37.270
Listen... Luke, d'you honestly think
that Sarah's gonna take you back

01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:39.118
if you've shot yourself in the head?

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:41.320
- He's got a point, Luke.
DAVID: Come on, mate.

01:05:42.999 --> 01:05:44.529
Give me the gun.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.883
No.

01:05:49.084 --> 01:05:50.614
Ah! Ah!

01:05:51.688 --> 01:05:54.169
Stop! Stop! Aah!

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.649
(Gunshot)

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:56.771
Aah!

01:05:56.772 --> 01:05:59.175
Your father just got the catering bill.

01:05:59.176 --> 01:06:00.944
Back in a minute. Watch her.

01:06:03.339 --> 01:06:06.822
Jesus, Luke! You could have killed
one of us, you bloody maniac!

01:06:06.823 --> 01:06:09.585
Alright, calm down.
Everybody, just take a deep breath.

01:06:09.586 --> 01:06:12.028
Oh, my God! I've been shot!

01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:14.110
<i>- What?
-  Look at my arm!</i>

01:06:14.111 --> 01:06:17.715
<i>- You shot me, Luke! You idiot!
-  Sorry.</i>

01:06:17.716 --> 01:06:19.917
<i>- Sorry?!
-  Alright, Jesus, Graham.</i>

01:06:19.917 --> 01:06:21.997
It's only a flesh wound,
can we stop moaning?

01:06:21.998 --> 01:06:23.440
I'm not moaning!

01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:25.441
It's always something with you,
isn't it?

01:06:25.442 --> 01:06:27.565
If it's not the malaise,
it's the air sickness.

01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:30.207
If not the air sickness,
it's something else! I'm sick of it!

01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:31.573
<i>-  I've been shot, Tom!
- Fine.</i>

01:06:31.574 --> 01:06:34.812
OK, let's all acknowledge the fact
that Graham's been shot, OK?

01:06:34.813 --> 01:06:37.535
- There! You happy now?
- Not really.

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:39.021
(Bleats)

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.942
<i>- Shit.
-  Oh, my God.</i>

01:06:47.706 --> 01:06:50.827
 Come on, baby

01:06:50.828 --> 01:06:52.873
 Let's do the twist... 

01:06:53.872 --> 01:06:56.835
There's no wound. It must have gone
into shock. What do we do?

01:06:56.836 --> 01:06:58.683
Maybe we should give it
mouth-to-mouth.

01:06:58.684 --> 01:07:00.158
- Good idea.
BOTH: Graham.

01:07:00.159 --> 01:07:01.886
<i>- Yes?
-  You know CPR, don't you?</i>

01:07:01.887 --> 01:07:03.562
Not on barnyard animals.

01:07:03.563 --> 01:07:06.205
Oh, come on, it's the same shit.
Just breathe into his mouth.

01:07:06.206 --> 01:07:08.216
<i>- You do it!
- You've had your hand up his arse.</i>

01:07:08.217 --> 01:07:10.171
What difference if you breathe
in his mouth?

01:07:10.172 --> 01:07:12.301
How do I even do it?
His mouth is the wrong shape!

01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:13.972
I can't even get any suction!

01:07:13.973 --> 01:07:17.817
Right! Out of the way.

01:07:17.818 --> 01:07:19.828
 Come on, little miss

01:07:20.901 --> 01:07:22.863
<i> And do the twist... </i>

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.225
(Sobs)

01:07:24.226 --> 01:07:26.867
One, two, three.

01:07:28.229 --> 01:07:30.471
Come on. Come on!

01:07:30.472 --> 01:07:32.919
- Come on, Ramsy.
- Breathe.

01:07:34.557 --> 01:07:36.238
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.810
<i>(Music stops abruptly)</i>

01:07:41.283 --> 01:07:43.052
<i>- It's not what it looks like.
-  Really?</i>

01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:49.370
(Luke sobs)

01:07:49.371 --> 01:07:51.052
(Ramsy grunts)

01:07:51.053 --> 01:07:52.856
TOM: He's alive! He's alive!

01:07:55.859 --> 01:07:58.180
- Mia, stop!
- What the hell was that, David?

01:07:58.181 --> 01:08:02.826
I mean, yeah, I've got a sense of humour
but who are you people?

01:08:02.827 --> 01:08:04.788
OK, OK, take a deep breath.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:07.230
Remember the beach, you and me,
Tuvalu.

01:08:07.231 --> 01:08:09.631
Tuvalu suddenly seems like
a very long way away!

01:08:09.632 --> 01:08:11.074
Mia, stop!

01:08:13.157 --> 01:08:15.117
Have I just made a terrible mistake?

01:08:15.118 --> 01:08:17.080
Have we just made
a terrible mistake here?

01:08:17.081 --> 01:08:19.042
Do we really know each other?

01:08:19.042 --> 01:08:23.167
I mean, maybe what we have
is just a holiday romance.

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:26.010
Don't say that. This is just
a really unfortunate situation.

01:08:26.011 --> 01:08:27.572
I'll sort it out, I promise!

01:08:27.573 --> 01:08:31.054
You keep saying that but it just seems
to get worse and worse and worse.

01:08:31.055 --> 01:08:33.136
It hasn't been that easy for me,
you know.

01:08:33.136 --> 01:08:35.460
I'm doing my best.

01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:37.541
And now I find out
you're gonna be a senator.

01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:41.234
I'm not going to be a senator.
I don't want to be a senator.

01:08:42.346 --> 01:08:45.069
Wha... Uh...

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:49.073
David, look,
all I want is to be with you.

01:08:49.073 --> 01:08:53.318
So I'm begging you,
whatever weird shit is going on here,

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:56.282
just sort it out.

01:08:56.283 --> 01:08:57.484
Please.

01:09:07.094 --> 01:09:09.055
You alright, bro?

01:09:09.055 --> 01:09:11.136
God, that was all a bit awkward,
wasn't it?

01:09:11.138 --> 01:09:13.103
I thought you were supposed to be
my friend.

01:09:15.343 --> 01:09:17.304
Wait, of course I'm your friend.

01:09:17.305 --> 01:09:21.669
<i>- What are you talking about?
-  The drugs. The sheep. The speech.</i>

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.679
Are you purposely trying
to screw up my life?

01:09:25.553 --> 01:09:27.923
- Why would I wanna do that, David?
- I don't know, Tom!

01:09:27.924 --> 01:09:31.478
Maybe because you're jealous?
Selfish? Immature?

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:34.042
Hang on a minute! Yeah, I'm immature!

01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:36.042
Who's the one marrying a girl
he barely knows

01:09:36.044 --> 01:09:38.807
and leaving his friends behind
like they don't count for shit?

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.368
How bloody immature is that, David?

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:44.733
OK, so I didn't entirely know
I felt like that until just now.

01:09:44.734 --> 01:09:46.656
But it's true, innit?

01:09:46.657 --> 01:09:49.377
You're dumping us.

01:09:49.377 --> 01:09:53.020
You're moving on and you're destroying
my youth in the process.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:57.226
Right, so what you're saying is that
you don't support me getting married.

01:09:57.227 --> 01:09:59.147
That's right, I don't.

01:09:59.148 --> 01:10:02.031
I think you met a girl on a beach
holiday, I think you don't know her

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:04.114
and I think you didn't even consult me,
David!

01:10:04.114 --> 01:10:05.677
- Consult you?!
- Yes, consult me!

01:10:05.678 --> 01:10:08.918
I'm sorry if my getting married
makes you feel old but I love this girl!

01:10:08.919 --> 01:10:12.283
- This is my chance to have a family.
- Thought we were your family.

01:10:12.283 --> 01:10:15.885
Yeah, but you're not my family, Tom.
You're my mates.

01:10:15.886 --> 01:10:19.731
And however much you call me
brother‘ or 'bro' won't change that

01:10:33.304 --> 01:10:34.987
Hello, Graham.

01:10:36.387 --> 01:10:37.950
(Whimpers)

01:10:39.472 --> 01:10:42.753
There you are, David!
The dance floor is hotting up!

01:10:42.754 --> 01:10:44.876
<i>- Hi, Barbara.
-  It's going off!</i>

01:10:44.877 --> 01:10:46.886
<i>- I've just got to...
-  No, not got to nothing.</i>

01:10:46.886 --> 01:10:48.561
You're not a real member of this family

01:10:48.562 --> 01:10:51.683
until you have macarenaed
with your mother-in-law.

01:10:51.684 --> 01:10:55.016
<i>- Where are my drugs?
-  There. They're all there.</i>

01:10:58.692 --> 01:11:01.214
Why do my drugs smell like shit?

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:03.301
Uh, we... We, um...

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.338
Had to, oh...

01:11:06.339 --> 01:11:08.142
You let me down, Graham.

01:11:10.544 --> 01:11:12.905
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

01:11:12.906 --> 01:11:15.189
<i>- I thought you liked me.
-  I do like you.</i>

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:16.959
Is that... Is that my suit?

01:11:18.952 --> 01:11:23.637
I shared with you and what do you do?
You spit it back in my face.

01:11:23.638 --> 01:11:26.361
The whole thing was just
a big misunderstanding.

01:11:26.362 --> 01:11:29.243
I never would have taken your bag
on purpose.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:31.526
Look, we're mates, aren't we?

01:11:31.527 --> 01:11:33.488
We're going out for dinner next week.

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.449
<i>Hmm?</i>

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:38.252
Maybe... Maybe a drink afterwards?

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:41.181
OK, sure. We'll have a good time.

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:47.832
<i>- What happened to your arm?
-  It's nothing.</i>

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:50.747
I just got kind of shot,
it's just a flesh wound.

01:11:50.748 --> 01:11:52.708
You're gonna need
to get that cleaned up.

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:56.872
<i>- Well, I think... -  No.
You need to get that cleaned up.</i>

01:11:56.873 --> 01:11:58.833
- OK.
- Good.

01:11:58.834 --> 01:12:01.236
Take your pants off.

01:12:01.237 --> 01:12:03.959
(Barbara laughs)

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.243
Ah! Hey! Yay!

01:12:07.244 --> 01:12:10.527
<i>- Thanks, that was great.
-  Where do you think you're going?</i>

01:12:10.528 --> 01:12:13.329
They haven't played YMCA yet. Yoohoo!

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:16.060
- (Luke whimpers)
- (Ramsy bleats)

01:12:17.976 --> 01:12:21.220
I was thinking I could maybe let you off
for taking the drugs.

01:12:25.463 --> 01:12:29.112
<i>- It was an accident, wasn't it?
-  Absolutely, Ray.</i>

01:12:30.789 --> 01:12:32.390
Oh!

01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:34.552
- No!
- Yes.

01:12:34.553 --> 01:12:37.756
<i>- What are you doing, you idiot?
-  Saving your arse, that's what.</i>

01:12:37.757 --> 01:12:41.198
I completely talked him around!
He was gonna let us off the drugs!

01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:44.122
How am I supposed to know that?
You're lying there bare-chested!

01:12:44.123 --> 01:12:46.645
<i>- I don't know what's going on!
-  What are we gonna do, Tom?</i>

01:12:46.646 --> 01:12:48.607
He's gonna go ballistic!

01:12:48.608 --> 01:12:51.174
Sauna - lock him in the sauna.

01:12:53.493 --> 01:12:55.743
Little bit too much to drink.

01:12:56.897 --> 01:13:00.419
 That's why we go to the YMCA

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:05.029
ALL:  That's why they go
to the YMCA... 

01:13:07.868 --> 01:13:10.390
- Dave?
- Oh.

01:13:10.391 --> 01:13:11.952
Hi.

01:13:11.953 --> 01:13:15.755
<i>- How's it going with finding Ramsy?
-  Who told you Ramsy was missing?</i>

01:13:15.756 --> 01:13:19.319
Mia. Mia, she told me.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.526
TOM: Blown it, we've blown it, Graham.

01:13:23.044 --> 01:13:25.206
<i>This is insane, is he gonna be OK?</i>

01:13:25.207 --> 01:13:27.168
We'll fix it, we'll fix everything.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.810
Let's just save this fucking wedding.

01:13:29.811 --> 01:13:31.974
DAVID: Alright, alright.

01:13:33.215 --> 01:13:35.377
Alright, guys, so here's the plan.

01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:37.339
First, get the sheep
back to the Old House.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.546
<i>Two, get rid of the drugs
and C - go back to the party</i>

01:13:39.547 --> 01:13:42.143
and behave like proper
adult human beings. Clear? Graham.

01:13:42.143 --> 01:13:44.265
How are we gonna get him
back to the Old House

01:13:44.266 --> 01:13:47.028
when there's, like,
a million people downstairs?

01:13:47.029 --> 01:13:49.792
We make a harness out of bedsheets
and lower him out the window.

01:13:49.793 --> 01:13:51.999
Graham, you come with me.
Tom, you lower him down.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.606
By myself? Look at the size
of the fucker. What if I drop him?

01:13:56.839 --> 01:13:58.601
Luke, we need your help.

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:02.054
I'm useless, David.
I'm just useless to everyone.

01:14:03.928 --> 01:14:07.049
Ah! That really hurt.

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:09.612
Good. I'm sick to death
of you feeling sorry for yourself.

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:11.574
Sarah's gone
and she's never coming back.

01:14:11.575 --> 01:14:13.056
(Sobs) No!

01:14:13.057 --> 01:14:14.498
- Ah!
- It's over.

01:14:14.499 --> 01:14:17.421
You got to pull yourself together.
Life's too short for this shit.

01:14:17.422 --> 01:14:20.109
<i>- (Sighs)
-  Luke, I want my friend back.</i>

01:14:22.187 --> 01:14:23.428
OK.

01:14:23.429 --> 01:14:25.830
 Yeah, I feel a little crazy

01:14:25.831 --> 01:14:28.552
 I feel a little strange

01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:31.435
 Like I'm in a pay phone

01:14:31.435 --> 01:14:34.959
 Without any change... 
- Sauna... Sauna!

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.925
Oh, this is fucked!
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:14:40.046 --> 01:14:42.733
<i> I feel like a school... 
-  Ramsy, Ramsy, good, Ramsy.</i>

01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:46.291
May we have a word, gentlemen?

01:14:46.292 --> 01:14:48.654
Good sheep, nice and tight.

01:14:48.655 --> 01:14:50.656
So, David, big day for you.

01:14:50.657 --> 01:14:53.859
Jet lag OK? Weather not too hot?

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:55.630
What's in the bag?

01:14:57.144 --> 01:14:58.945
This bag?

01:15:00.227 --> 01:15:02.553
<i>- Wedding presents.
-  Presents, wedding presents.</i>

01:15:02.554 --> 01:15:05.993
May we see the wedding presents?

01:15:05.993 --> 01:15:07.435
Yep.

01:15:15.163 --> 01:15:18.486
That's one. I haven't wrapped it yet.

01:15:18.487 --> 01:15:22.495
Gentlemen, you may be aware
that Ramsy is missing.

01:15:23.812 --> 01:15:26.333
Jim's sheep.

01:15:26.334 --> 01:15:28.300
Have you seen the sheep?

01:15:33.622 --> 01:15:35.905
Have you seen any sheep?

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.149
Oof!

01:15:44.194 --> 01:15:47.437
GRAHAM: I saw a sheep... once.

01:15:48.519 --> 01:15:51.369
When... I was a kid.

01:15:53.043 --> 01:15:54.803
(Mobile phone rings)

01:15:54.804 --> 01:15:56.934
You'll tell us if you see anything,
won't you?

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:00.809
We'll shout.

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:01.931
Mum! Hello.

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:04.499
Alright. Off you go.

01:16:07.298 --> 01:16:09.539
- Feel like I'm gonna be sick.
DAVID: Not yet.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.822
We've got to get Ramsy
back to the Old House first.

01:16:11.823 --> 01:16:12.828
Then you can be sick.

01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:14.785
Whoa! Whoa!

01:16:14.786 --> 01:16:16.546
Whoa...

01:16:16.547 --> 01:16:19.070
Oh! No! No!

01:16:32.364 --> 01:16:35.247
ALL: One, two, three.

01:16:35.248 --> 01:16:37.018
(squeals)

01:16:39.131 --> 01:16:40.813
Please! Let me out!

01:16:42.495 --> 01:16:43.534
Let me out!

01:16:43.535 --> 01:16:44.696
Thanks, guys.

01:16:44.697 --> 01:16:46.663
I'm just gonna go and be sick now.

01:16:47.899 --> 01:16:49.867
<i>(Door unlocks)
- Fuck! Go! Go!</i>

01:16:59.273 --> 01:17:00.713
MIA: Well?

01:17:00.714 --> 01:17:04.838
<i>- It's taken care of.
-  You are one lucky bastard.</i>

01:17:04.839 --> 01:17:06.801

01:17:06.801 --> 01:17:10.603
<i>-  You are one lucky orphaned bastard.
- I know.</i>

01:17:10.604 --> 01:17:12.566

01:17:12.567 --> 01:17:14.888
(Laughs)

01:17:14.889 --> 01:17:18.011
Uh, Jim, I don't know how
but Ramsy‘s back.

01:17:18.012 --> 01:17:20.374
Must have just gone for a little walk.

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:22.817
Oh, well, so he just opened the gate
by himself,

01:17:22.818 --> 01:17:25.980
had a little cup of coffee,
came home and closed the gate?

01:17:25.981 --> 01:17:27.942
Sorry to waste your time, Leo.

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:30.584
As long as Ramsy is safe and sound,
that's all that counts.

01:17:30.585 --> 01:17:33.989
Ready the ram. My future's riding on it.

01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:36.555
Help! Aah!

01:17:39.394 --> 01:17:43.278
And now, the one
you've all been waiting for... Ramsy!

<i>(clapping)</i>

01:17:46.644 --> 01:17:49.373
 Baa, Baa, Black Sheep

01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:55.656
This is really weird.

01:18:02.218 --> 01:18:04.185
Follow that, Dave.

01:18:09.146 --> 01:18:10.828
Thanks, everyone.

01:18:10.829 --> 01:18:13.990
Firstly, I'd like to thank
Jim and Barbara

01:18:13.991 --> 01:18:16.914
for putting on
such a magnificent wedding...

01:18:16.915 --> 01:18:19.963
and doesn't Barbara look stunning,
everyone?

01:18:22.801 --> 01:18:26.243
Uh, the bridesmaids, of course,

01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:29.096
the caterers...

01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:35.654
Mia, I don't think
I can describe in words

01:18:35.655 --> 01:18:37.375
just how much you mean to me.

01:18:37.376 --> 01:18:40.860
So I hope that this little video

01:18:40.861 --> 01:18:44.749
will go some way towards showing
just how much I love you.

01:18:48.428 --> 01:18:51.031
<i>VIDEO: Shotgun Ramsy,
shotgun Ramsy.</i>

01:18:51.032 --> 01:18:52.757

<i>David kissed a sheep,

Stop it. Cut it. Cut it.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.404
Right, that's not the video
I meant to play. Obviously.

01:19:04.405 --> 01:19:06.245
You violated my sheep!

01:19:06.246 --> 01:19:10.450
Jim, I know that looks bad but, really,
we were just playing dress-ups.

01:19:10.451 --> 01:19:12.341
It's not like
we're a bunch of criminals.

01:19:12.342 --> 01:19:14.654
Where is my fucking cocaine?!

<i>(Shocked gasps)</i>

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.542
Graham.

You lying, thieving,
stealing little motherfucker.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.591
I'm gonna kill you.

01:19:30.592 --> 01:19:33.475
Alright, fella, drop the gun.

01:19:33.476 --> 01:19:35.441

01:19:41.884 --> 01:19:45.367
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
It's going to be alright.

01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:48.050
You gave it your best shot.

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:50.372
Even if it was just for three hours.

01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:52.334
(Mia sobs)

01:19:52.335 --> 01:19:54.296
This is the best wedding
I've ever been to.

01:19:54.297 --> 01:19:56.299
I can't wait to see
what's gonna happen next.

01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:00.063
 Baby we can talk all night... 

01:20:00.064 --> 01:20:02.266
DAVID: We didn't plan any of this.

01:20:02.267 --> 01:20:06.109
Oh, really?! You didn't plan to offend
the entire Australian parliament

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:10.514
with your hilarious antics
of sheep stealing, racism and buggery,

01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:12.755
not to mention
that naked gun-wielding maniac!

01:20:12.756 --> 01:20:14.958
We didn't actually steal the sheep.

01:20:14.959 --> 01:20:17.285
We may have dressed it up
with some bra and panties...

01:20:17.286 --> 01:20:20.084
Shut up! Or I'll break
your other fucking hand!

01:20:20.085 --> 01:20:22.246
 Baby you can cry all night... 

01:20:22.247 --> 01:20:25.089
<i>-  That's a bit harsh.
- With all due respect, Jim,</i>

01:20:25.090 --> 01:20:27.251
I know the wedding
hasn't been the smoothest...

01:20:27.252 --> 01:20:30.294
Do you seriously think
under any circumstances

01:20:30.295 --> 01:20:32.538
I would allow my daughter
to associate with you,

01:20:32.539 --> 01:20:34.499
the backpacker,

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.466
and this bunch of deadbeats?

01:20:38.704 --> 01:20:40.506
Jim.

01:20:42.388 --> 01:20:45.030
When I proposed to your daughter,

01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:47.472
I could not stop thinking about
what it would feel like

01:20:47.473 --> 01:20:48.959
to be a part of a real family.

01:20:50.878 --> 01:20:54.801
What I've come to realise is that
these 'deadbeats' as you call them

01:20:54.802 --> 01:21:00.046
these idiots, morons,
complete and total fuck-ups...

01:21:00.047 --> 01:21:02.008
OK, David, we get the picture.

01:21:02.009 --> 01:21:03.658
..they are my family.

01:21:05.412 --> 01:21:07.734
And they're not perfect

01:21:07.735 --> 01:21:11.578
but I know that no matter what happens,

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:13.306
they'll always be there for me.

01:21:14.782 --> 01:21:16.423
I'll always be there for them.

01:21:16.424 --> 01:21:18.665
What on earth
are you blathering on about?

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:21.388
I love your daughter.

01:21:21.389 --> 01:21:24.196
And I will do whatever it takes
to make this right.

01:21:27.676 --> 01:21:30.484
Save your breath, son. It's over.

01:21:39.809 --> 01:21:45.500
 Baby we can talk all night... 

01:21:47.418 --> 01:21:49.188
GRAHAM: I'm really sorry, David.

01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:54.182
LUKE: I actually got some really good
therapists specialized in this area.

01:21:54.183 --> 01:21:55.664
Maybe we could go together.

01:21:55.665 --> 01:21:58.108
Yes, it's not all bad.
He can come back to London with us,

01:21:58.109 --> 01:22:00.830
go to therapy with Luke,
watch Graham vomit his cheese,

01:22:00.831 --> 01:22:04.754
everything will stay the same
till we're old and lonely and grey.

01:22:04.755 --> 01:22:09.005
Now, haven't you got a video to deliver,
brother?

01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:12.844
Sweetheart.

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:14.805
I know you're upset.

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:17.609
But it hasn't been a total washout.

01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:19.771
It was going to be a wedding present...

01:22:21.412 --> 01:22:23.415
Jim, this is not the time.

01:22:23.415 --> 01:22:26.698
Congratulations, Senator.

01:22:26.699 --> 01:22:28.940
<i>- Wha...
-  I'm retiring, sweetheart.</i>

01:22:28.941 --> 01:22:31.463
And I'm giving my seat to you.

01:22:31.464 --> 01:22:33.386
(Tom whispers): Bigger one.

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:37.350
The party's all behind it
and if Eddie Marshall gives the OK,

01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:39.311
you'll be running on your own
next election.

01:22:39.312 --> 01:22:40.312
How could you?

01:22:40.313 --> 01:22:42.915
TOM: Big one.
GRAHAM: Bigger one.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:44.916
(Glass shatters) Oh!

01:22:44.917 --> 01:22:46.644
DAVID: Mia?

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:50.564
Mia?

01:22:52.325 --> 01:22:54.527
I'm so sorry for what happened today.

01:22:54.528 --> 01:22:56.489
More than you can imagine.

01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:59.572
But I'm not sorry I met you,
I'm not sorry I love you,

01:22:59.572 --> 01:23:01.094
I'm not sorry I married you.

01:23:01.095 --> 01:23:03.737
What is it about ‘it's over‘
you don't understand, Dave?

01:23:03.738 --> 01:23:07.541
My name's David, not Dave
and I'm talking to Mia so shut up!

01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:09.103
Leave him, Jim.

01:23:09.104 --> 01:23:11.714
Please, Mia.

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:18.156
Just press play?

01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:23.718
Mia, give me the phone.

01:23:23.719 --> 01:23:26.121
- Jim, for God's sake, shut up!
- Shut up!

01:23:26.122 --> 01:23:28.526
They told me nobody was here.

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:32.527
And I guess that's why I came.

01:23:32.528 --> 01:23:35.811
I was lost and I needed time
to figure it out

01:23:35.812 --> 01:23:38.499
and suddenly, there you were.

01:23:39.775 --> 01:23:41.818
On the same beach
looking for the same thing.

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.140
This little beach
is where my life began.

01:23:45.141 --> 01:23:47.305
My parents left me a trust.

01:23:48.385 --> 01:23:50.351
Just enough to put down a deposit.

01:23:52.429 --> 01:23:54.391
It's ours, Mia.

01:23:54.392 --> 01:23:57.234
It's not England or Australia.

01:23:57.235 --> 01:23:58.635
Ours.

01:23:58.636 --> 01:24:00.917
I know we've only just met

01:24:00.918 --> 01:24:03.639
but I know that we belong together.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.169
I love you.

01:24:07.045 --> 01:24:10.932
So, let's start here and
figure out the next part together.

01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:14.171
That's it.

01:24:14.172 --> 01:24:16.693
Everything I've got and it's yours.

01:24:16.694 --> 01:24:18.816
I could buy you a better beach
in Noosa!

01:24:18.817 --> 01:24:20.619
Dad, stop.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.380
But he's just a backpacker!

01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:24.582
You were a hitchhiker when I met you!

01:24:24.583 --> 01:24:28.185
It's not about the beach... or luck.

01:24:28.186 --> 01:24:30.548
It's destiny and I love him.

01:24:30.549 --> 01:24:32.310
Run, Mia, run!

01:24:32.311 --> 01:24:34.322
Jim, let go.

01:24:52.693 --> 01:24:54.659
She's really fallen for him. (Laughs)

01:24:57.377 --> 01:24:58.984
BARBARA: Oh...
MIA: David!

01:25:05.025 --> 01:25:08.068
Darling, you may have lost a senator

01:25:08.069 --> 01:25:10.996
but you've gained a beautiful daughter.
Hic!

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:15.801
- And a beautiful son.
- Ow.

01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:22.202
 Oh, Mickey, you're so fine

01:25:22.202 --> 01:25:24.285
 You're so fine you blow my mind
Hey, Mickey

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:27.170
 Hey, Mickey, hey, Mickey,
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey... 

01:25:29.091 --> 01:25:30.259
(Sobs)

01:25:31.533 --> 01:25:35.016
- What happened to your arm?
- Oh, this?

01:25:35.017 --> 01:25:38.861
Oh, yeah, I just sort of got... shot.

01:25:38.862 --> 01:25:40.422
- Shot?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.423 --> 01:25:43.306
It's OK, though, it's just...
a little bit of flesh wound.

01:25:43.307 --> 01:25:45.027
Ah! Ah!

01:25:45.028 --> 01:25:47.670
 When you take me by the hooves,
who's ever gonna know

01:25:47.671 --> 01:25:50.591
 And every time you move,
I let a little more show

01:25:50.592 --> 01:25:54.198
 There's somethin' we can use
so don't say no, Mickey

01:25:56.761 --> 01:25:59.802
 So come on give it to me
any way you can

01:25:59.803 --> 01:26:02.686
 Any way you want to,
I'll take it like a man

01:26:02.687 --> 01:26:05.569
 Oh, please, baby, please,
don't leave me in the damn... 

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:07.811
Sarah? Yeah, listen, it's me.

01:26:07.812 --> 01:26:09.253
No, don't hang up.

01:26:09.254 --> 01:26:11.455
It's the last time I'm gonna call you,
I swear.

01:26:11.456 --> 01:26:15.661
Just have one teeny, tiny question
I've been wanting to ask.

01:26:17.062 --> 01:26:19.383
TOM: Sorry I almost fucked up
your wedding.

01:26:19.384 --> 01:26:22.466
DAVID: My wedding?
How about my life?

01:26:22.467 --> 01:26:24.549
Well, that's your job, right?

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:26.516
That's what big brothers do.

01:26:29.876 --> 01:26:31.597
I'm impressed, man.

01:26:31.598 --> 01:26:34.360
You've backed a real winner.
She's perfect.

01:26:34.361 --> 01:26:37.042
Wait, did you just say you were wrong?

01:26:37.043 --> 01:26:39.725
No, I just said I was sorry
and you'll be really fucking sorry

01:26:39.726 --> 01:26:41.767
if that island is too small
for my surfboard.

01:26:41.767 --> 01:26:43.494
Now, come here, man.

01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:46.251
Respect.

01:26:46.252 --> 01:26:49.536
You did it. First out of the gate.

01:26:49.536 --> 01:26:51.657
Fuck knows,
it gives me hope for Graham.

01:26:51.658 --> 01:26:55.661
Guys, I pulled her. I pulled a lesbian.

01:26:55.662 --> 01:26:59.186
<i>- Oh, I don't believe it.
-  Guys! He's got a penis!</i>

01:26:59.187 --> 01:27:00.708
Congratulations, man.

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:02.670
- Oh, great, he's got a penis.
- Whoa...

01:27:02.671 --> 01:27:04.919
<i>(Distant screaming)
-  And a massive phone bill.</i>

01:27:07.715 --> 01:27:09.200
Luke?

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.201
<i>LUKE: Help!</i>

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:15.964
GRAHAM: Oh, shit.

01:27:18.647 --> 01:27:22.732
OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN:
 I confess my heart's in a mess

01:27:25.374 --> 01:27:29.099
 I lost my way and need you to say

01:27:39.028 --> 01:27:44.283
 I can tell you I love you
whenever you need reminding

01:27:46.116 --> 01:27:52.482
 And be where you go when you think
there'll be no silver lining

01:27:52.483 --> 01:27:55.404
 When you need my understanding

01:27:55.405 --> 01:27:59.809
 I've given you all that I can give

01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:01.731
 And when I'm a fool

01:28:01.732 --> 01:28:05.937
 I'm hoping that you'll forgive

01:28:07.057 --> 01:28:09.980
<i> I confess my heart's in a mess</i>

01:28:09.981 --> 01:28:13.625
 But you can untangle it

01:28:13.626 --> 01:28:17.107
 I lost my way and need you to say

01:28:17.108 --> 01:28:20.151
 Say you'll untangle it

01:28:20.152 --> 01:28:23.635
 If you show me I'm a keeper

01:28:23.636 --> 01:28:26.837
 If you lift me up and love me deeper

01:28:26.838 --> 01:28:31.483
 I'm no angel but I promise you this

01:28:31.484 --> 01:28:36.858
 I'm gonna be weightless

01:28:49.502 --> 01:28:54.549
 I will make you all mine
I'm not giving up for a minute

01:28:56.591 --> 01:29:02.396
 But love can be lonely
if you are the only one in it

01:29:02.396 --> 01:29:04.517
 I believe

01:29:04.518 --> 01:29:10.044
 That any moment
you could be standing at my door

01:29:10.045 --> 01:29:12.087
 Don't make it too late

01:29:12.088 --> 01:29:14.939
 I don't want to wait no more

01:29:17.533 --> 01:29:20.616
<i> I confess my heart's in a mess</i>

01:29:20.616 --> 01:29:23.698
 But you can untangle it

01:29:23.699 --> 01:29:27.542
 I'm on my knees
and begging you please

01:29:27.543 --> 01:29:30.626
 To say you'll untangle it

01:29:30.627 --> 01:29:34.070
 If you show me I'm a keeper

01:29:34.071 --> 01:29:37.553
 If you lift me up and love me deeper

01:29:37.554 --> 01:29:41.957
 I'm no angel but I promise you this

01:29:41.958 --> 01:29:49.048
 I'm gonna be weightless

01:29:55.132 --> 01:29:57.294
<i> Weightless</i>

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:14.517
<i> Weightless</i>

01:30:27.967 --> 01:30:32.450
 Oh, if you show me I'm a keeper

01:30:32.451 --> 01:30:35.895
 If you lift me up and love me deeper

01:30:35.896 --> 01:30:40.299
 I'm no angel but I promise you this

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:43.180
 I'm gonna be weightless

01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:51.832
<i> I confess my heart's in a mess</i>

01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:55.316
<i> You can untangle it</i>

01:30:55.317 --> 01:30:58.557
<i> I lost my way, I need you to say</i>

01:30:58.558 --> 01:31:02.042
<i> Say you'll untangle it</i>

01:31:02.043 --> 01:31:05.445
<i> I confess my heart's in a mess</i>

01:31:05.446 --> 01:31:09.090
<i> You can untangle it</i>

01:31:09.091 --> 01:31:12.373
<i> On my knees
I'm begging you, please</i>

01:31:12.374 --> 01:31:15.256
<i> Baby untangle it</i>

01:31:15.257 --> 01:31:19.671
<i> I'm gonna be weight...
 I'm gonna be weight...</i>

01:31:26.348 --> 01:31:28.271
<i> Less. </i>

01:31:29.305 --> 01:31:35.780
