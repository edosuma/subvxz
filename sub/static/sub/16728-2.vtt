WEBVTT

00:04.769 --> 00:06.469
Kiss me back.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.408
Are you sure you wanna do this?

00:08.640 --> 00:11.375
We've been friends
for a really long time.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.620
I think I missed part of the story.
Why was it a disaster?

00:16.680 --> 00:18.540
He's been shagging someone else.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.020
You're too scared to commit to anything.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.623
You just wait, in 10 years' time,

00:21.648 --> 00:23.209
you'll still be working
in a coffee shop.

00:23.234 --> 00:24.780
Is this about you and me
hooking up the other night,

00:24.880 --> 00:26.540
because if it is,
it really wasn't worth it.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.100
This guy, Jack Winters.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.820
A chef, totally hot, totally manly.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.140
- I want you to come and do our show.
- Why?

00:34.240 --> 00:37.900
Because if you don't,
I will lose my job.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.740
- Tell her about garlic.
- What?!

00:39.800 --> 00:42.140
Garlic's not used in this recipe.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.460
Oh, shit.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.300
I want you to listen carefully
and repeat after me...

00:48.640 --> 00:51.260
Wow. Let's share it.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.220
Do you wish we hadn't crossed that line?

00:58.400 --> 00:59.540
No.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.180
It was perfect.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.380
That other woman I told you about,
Meredith...

01:06.440 --> 01:07.900
...she's pregnant.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.540
Oh.

01:19.640 --> 01:20.940
Aha!

01:22.700 --> 01:24.940
- Look at this.
- What's your plan?

01:25.040 --> 01:27.820
My plan is... go in through here
and then I'll let you in...

01:27.920 --> 01:30.220
- What are you...?
- Ah! Oh.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.399
I don't think you're gonna fit
through that.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.540
I can. I'll go in first.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.180
I know how to get into small spaces.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.660
I've done it heaps of times
in caves in South America.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.020
Arms first like Superman.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.020
Ah.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.640
- Ah, yeah.
- Um...

01:48.680 --> 01:49.720
You OK?

01:49.760 --> 01:51.220
I think I'm stuck.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.220
Take my skirt off.

01:53.320 --> 01:56.820
I think it's the buckle that's
stopping me from getting through.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.640
Ah, it's not your buckle.
It's more your...

01:59.740 --> 02:03.360
- Just take off my skirt.
- I feel weird taking off your skirt.

02:03.460 --> 02:06.820
Pity you didn't feel
weird about it the other night.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.360
That is uncool.

02:09.580 --> 02:12.460
What the hell is going on here?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.690
- Ah.
- Hello?

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.960 --> 02:37.720
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.260
I thought maybe you weren't coming.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.220
Nah. Noodle night. Never miss it.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.900
Hey, I'm...
I'm glad things are OK between...

02:48.960 --> 02:50.060
...you know, us.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.140
Me too.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.660
Hey, let's pretend it never happened.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.060
Let's move on, we're grown-ups.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.580
What happened happened,
let's just pack it away.

02:57.640 --> 03:01.060
You're right. Let's pack it away.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.460
Why ruin a friendship based
on one five-minute mistake.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.180
It was longer than five minutes.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.220
- Not a lot longer.
- Quite a bit longer.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.940
Anyway, you're right,
let's pack it away.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.740
So, I need your advice about Meredith,

03:19.840 --> 03:22.080
but if you don't want to
talk about it, I get it.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.020
- I can talk about it.
- Really? Thank you.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.720
Because I really need your help.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.060
I don't know, exactly,

03:28.160 --> 03:30.060
but I didn't think having a child
was a possibility.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.260
I mean, I tried with my ex for years
and years and nothing happened.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.860
And we were having sex night and day.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.300
I mean, literally, we were doing it

03:36.400 --> 03:38.020
every morning, every afternoon
and every night.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.940
- Wow. Sounds like a lot of sex.
- It was!

03:41.040 --> 03:43.940
And then, with you and I, you know,
we hardly ever really did it.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.620
Well, we did a bit.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.000
Yeah, but, you know, not a lot.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.580
- And then... bang.
- Literally, huh?

03:49.640 --> 03:50.640
Yeah.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.540
So, what is this now?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.808
What sort of relationship are we in?

03:56.833 --> 04:01.140
Oh, well, it's a shock, isn't it,
for both of us?

04:01.240 --> 04:03.760
So let's just sit with it for a while

04:03.860 --> 04:08.380
and... ah, we can catch up
at the end of the week and...

04:08.440 --> 04:10.020
Make some decisions.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.460
My advice is...

04:11.520 --> 04:13.180
...be completely honest.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.460
OK, so I'll just say...
I don't want a child.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.459
- Ever?
- I don't think so.

04:17.519 --> 04:18.860
OK. Don't say that.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.420
I'm changing my advice.
My advice is say nothing.

04:21.519 --> 04:24.080
I think there's gonna be
an expectation that I will speak.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.180
Then say very little.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.780
I feel like I should lay
all our options on the table.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.060
What are your options?

04:30.160 --> 04:34.720
Well, the first option would be that we...
could not... proceed with the...

04:34.760 --> 04:36.820
Do not say that.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.420
So you're saying I shouldn't be honest?

04:38.480 --> 04:40.100
I think it will help.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.500
Now, Jack, tell us what delicious bites

04:43.600 --> 04:44.940
will we be learning how to cook
next week?

04:45.040 --> 04:47.140
I'm gonna show you dishes
you can make using ingredients

04:47.240 --> 04:49.640
from your own garden that perhaps
you didn't even know you had.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.220
Fantastic. I can't wait for that one.

04:51.320 --> 04:56.213
Absolutely. Coming up tomorrow,
how to do yoga with your dog.

04:56.238 --> 04:57.378
Do you know what?

04:57.403 --> 04:59.460
I'm gonna bring in my little pooch
and I'm gonna give it a go.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.740
Well, you should!

05:00.840 --> 05:03.460
I imagine your dog brings you a lot
of joy on those cold winter nights,

05:03.560 --> 05:05.580
so you wanna make sure you keep him
nice and flexible.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.660
Hamilton, what about you?
You got any pets?

05:07.760 --> 05:10.140
Well, if I did, Eric,
you'd be the last to know.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.180
Hamilton likes to keep
his private life private.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.500
Just from you, Eric.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.900
Have a great weekend, everyone.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.220
- See you tomorrow. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.640
And we're clear.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.360
Eric, what was that about?

05:24.440 --> 05:27.860
I was just playing off your comment.
In fact, I was making you look good.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.780
How does implying I have sex
with my dog make me look good?

05:30.840 --> 05:33.100
It shows you have a sense of humour.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.280
Oh, yes, because everyone finds
bestiality hilarious.

05:36.380 --> 05:37.420
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.220
Thanks for having me
at your place the other night.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.180
- You're welcome. It was fun.
- You disappeared with your boyfriend.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.820
Oh, no, Pete's not my boyfriend.
No, he's just a friend.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.540
- We'll talk later.
- Yep.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.780
- Well done on Jack.
- Thank you.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.500
There's pretty much only one rule
in television,

05:52.600 --> 05:54.580
keep the talent happy
and everything else follows.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.140
What we're selling
is masculinity, a fantasy.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.140
It's sex.
Sex at the beach, sex at sea...

06:04.240 --> 06:06.140
- Sex while fishing.
- Exactly!

06:06.240 --> 06:08.860
We are connecting good food,
health and hotness.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.280
Mm. I love it.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.740
Our research says that people
tuned in because it's Jack,

06:13.840 --> 06:15.540
not because it's cooking,
not because it's food,

06:15.600 --> 06:17.100
it's because he's handsome.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.780
- So let's push that.
- I know that his focus is health.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.900
He has some very strong feelings
about objectification.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.720
Is that even a word?

06:23.820 --> 06:25.460
- Yes.
- Get him over the line.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.920
OK, everyone, thank you.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.020
Lily, can you stay behind for a moment?

06:32.880 --> 06:35.500
Listen, you know what's gonna
happen. Eric will read the press,

06:35.600 --> 06:37.700
he'll see he's less popular
than Jack and start playing up.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.360
I need you to produce him.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.540
He's got an idea for a new segment,
make it happen.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.940
Isn't Dale producing him?

06:43.040 --> 06:45.220
He likes you. Make him feel like a star.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.180
Every time a new man comes on the
show, his balls start to deflate.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.300
Your job is to inflate them again.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.540
So you want them fully inflated?

06:52.640 --> 06:55.460
- Rock hard?
- I think so.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.460
Hello?

07:01.920 --> 07:03.540
Eric?

07:03.600 --> 07:05.180
I'm in the shower.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.220
Oh. Um...

07:07.280 --> 07:09.540
Sorry. I'll come back in 10 minutes.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.940
No, no. Come in.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.640
Come into the bathroom.

07:12.680 --> 07:13.820
Oh.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.100
- OK.
- Yeah, come on. Have a seat.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.180
Sasha tells me
we're gonna be working together.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.700
I know.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.140
I'm really looking forward to it.

07:27.240 --> 07:31.140
Just between you and me,
I don't think Dale quite gets me.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.700
Really? That surprises me.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.540
You know what my real passion is?

07:36.840 --> 07:38.300
Current affairs.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.740
- I didn't know that.
- Oh, yeah.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.614
Before I started doing breakfast,
I was a journalist.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.920
Weren't you on
the Home Shopping Network?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.640
Yes. That's right.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.820
Dale's a good guy, don't get me wrong,

07:53.920 --> 07:57.940
but... you just can't say everything
in 15 seconds.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.000
It's like he times the introductions.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.280
He does time them. We have to.

08:03.380 --> 08:08.420
Yeah, but the thing is, some things
can't be said in 15 seconds.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.920
Especially if you want to say them well.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.340
Look, if there's a specific problem...

08:13.440 --> 08:16.280
...maybe you should address
it with Dale, 'cause...

08:17.700 --> 08:19.420
Listen to this...

08:19.730 --> 08:24.190
politicians take advantage
of taxation loopholes.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.860
Or...

08:27.980 --> 08:29.780
...pollies polish off pathetic perks.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.140
Which sounds better?

08:32.539 --> 08:34.659
I don't really know what
the second one means, so...

08:34.760 --> 08:37.340
But the second one sounds better
regardless of what it means.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.100
And that's the thing about television.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.539
It's... it's an aural medium.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.299
It's about...

08:43.360 --> 08:44.980
...it's about listening.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.935
Isn't that radio?
I thought TV was visual.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.920
I am so excited about working
with you, seriously.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.390
You... you have what it takes.

08:54.249 --> 08:56.180
Oh, come here.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.740
Oh.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.780
Just give us a moment, will you, mate?

09:00.880 --> 09:04.300
- Ah, sorry, Nikkii said you were...
- Oh, no, please, don't apologise.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.920
Just give us a moment.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.340
Oh, what about us?!

09:09.440 --> 09:11.700
Heh. Oh.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.026
I was just coming to find you.

09:15.051 --> 09:17.180
- I'm sorry about before.
- No. Don't worry about that.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.060
- The door was open, so I didn't...
- Please, don't apologise.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.820
I... have no relationship with Eric
other than a professional one.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.420
OK.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.340
I just wanted to make that
absolutely clear.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.020
And you have succeeded.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.920
I just wanted to give you the dishes
I'm planning to cook

09:30.960 --> 09:32.020
as part of the promo shoot.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.860
Thank you. I'll have everything there.

09:33.885 --> 09:34.860
Ah, good.

09:34.885 --> 09:36.945
Because Nikkii mentioned there
mightn't be any cooking in the promo,

09:36.969 --> 09:38.410
which I thought was odd.

09:38.435 --> 09:41.146
That's not what we're doing.
I'll talk to her.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.640
Do you think we need to bother
with shirts at all?

09:45.720 --> 09:49.220
Yes. He's wearing a shirt, Nikkii.
And he's cooking.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.060
- He is a chef who wears clothes.
- OK.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.460
So the look I'm thinking of for Jack
is just very cool, very sexy,

09:55.560 --> 09:58.700
maybe just some dirty old jeans
with the top button undone.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.820
- He's not an escort, Nikkii.
- Could be if he wanted to be.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.340
Why would he want to be?

10:02.440 --> 10:04.500
I'm just responding to our viewers,
they like him.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.560
Let's give them what they want.

10:12.081 --> 10:13.386
So?

10:13.699 --> 10:15.084
So?

10:15.085 --> 10:16.425
You first.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.225
I've got nothing to report.

10:18.325 --> 10:21.945
I think things are back on track
with me and Pete, but I don't know.

10:22.045 --> 10:24.625
My question is not why did you
do it with Pete,

10:24.685 --> 10:25.865
but why didn't you do it sooner?

10:25.925 --> 10:27.245
I don't know.

10:27.305 --> 10:30.305
Either he had someone or I did.

10:30.365 --> 10:33.025
And... then we were so close.

10:33.085 --> 10:34.745
We were friends.

10:36.545 --> 10:38.745
What about you and the chef?
What happened?

10:38.845 --> 10:42.225
- Oh... everything and nothing.
- What does that mean?

10:42.325 --> 10:46.025
It means I think I've met the one,
which is the everything part,

10:46.125 --> 10:49.845
but we didn't shag,
which is tragically the nothing.

10:49.885 --> 10:51.505
Why didn't you shag?

10:52.605 --> 10:55.225
Because I didn't want to rush things.

10:55.285 --> 10:56.785
He didn't want to?

10:56.885 --> 11:00.405
He wasn't ready to.
Which is very, very different.

11:00.505 --> 11:03.265
I believe I've gone from
20-something hook-up

11:03.325 --> 11:05.265
to 30-something settling down.

11:05.325 --> 11:07.345
Now you're settling down with him?

11:07.405 --> 11:08.945
Did you exchange numbers?

11:09.005 --> 11:10.065
Yep.

11:10.125 --> 11:11.945
When you say "exchange numbers",

11:12.045 --> 11:14.665
did you put his number
in your phone and call him?

11:14.725 --> 11:16.025
Yep.

11:16.085 --> 11:17.205
I'm gonna text him.

11:17.305 --> 11:19.745
I think we should go out
on an old-school date.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.705
- I'm gonna ask him out.
- That's not old school.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.925
What did you write?

11:24.985 --> 11:26.745
"Wanna have dinner with me?"

11:26.845 --> 11:29.945
- Any emojis?
- Kiss, wink and aubergine.

11:30.005 --> 11:32.385
Confusing and vulgar.

11:32.485 --> 11:33.705
I did the aubergine because he's a chef.

11:33.765 --> 11:34.985
No, you didn't.

11:35.045 --> 11:36.985
I can't stop thinking about him.

11:37.085 --> 11:40.385
You're working with him. Suss him
out, tell me what you think.

11:40.445 --> 11:42.345
I'm not gonna suss him out.

11:42.405 --> 11:44.625
Oh!

11:44.725 --> 11:46.625
That doesn't look like
my man, my man

11:46.725 --> 11:48.865
My man doesn't have
a swagger like that

11:48.925 --> 11:50.225
That doesn't look like my man...

11:50.285 --> 11:52.205
Can we do it with the shirt off?

11:52.245 --> 11:53.925
I think leave it on.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.025
And cut.
Can we set up the kayak, please?

11:56.125 --> 11:58.385
- You all good?
- When am I gonna cook something?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.465
I'm onto it. How are we going for time?

12:00.565 --> 12:03.145
Oh, we're fine, now Nikkii said
we could lose the barbecue stuff.

12:03.205 --> 12:04.565
Put the barbecue back in?

12:04.645 --> 12:06.205
We can't do the kayak and the cooking.

12:06.305 --> 12:08.105
Take the kayak out
and put the barbecue back in.

12:08.165 --> 12:09.265
OK.

12:09.325 --> 12:10.905
Light up the barbie!

12:10.965 --> 12:12.785
Why are we losing the kayak?

12:12.885 --> 12:16.385
We're not promoting a chef
who doesn't cook.

12:19.545 --> 12:21.505
That doesn't look like my man, my man

12:21.605 --> 12:23.905
My man doesn't have
a swagger like that

12:24.005 --> 12:26.265
That doesn't look like my man,
my man...

12:26.325 --> 12:28.665
And cut! Let's go again.

12:29.845 --> 12:31.925
Make sure you get some close-ups.

12:32.005 --> 12:34.105
And make sure you get some wide shots.

12:34.205 --> 12:35.625
That doesn't look like my man, my man

12:35.725 --> 12:37.985
My man doesn't have
a swagger like that

12:38.085 --> 12:41.385
That doesn't look like my man,
my man...

12:41.485 --> 12:43.065
This summer I'll show you how to cook

12:43.165 --> 12:45.105
freshly caught snapper on the barbecue.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.485
Perfect for entertaining.

12:47.765 --> 12:50.385
Cut. And we've wrapped.

12:50.445 --> 12:52.865
Thanks, Jack. Thanks, everyone.

12:52.965 --> 12:55.505
- Are you happy?
- More importantly, are you happy?

12:55.605 --> 12:59.145
I am. Not as much cooking
in the promo as I expected.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.985
There'll be a montage of
different shots of you,

13:01.085 --> 13:03.105
but it will always
go back to the cooking.

13:03.165 --> 13:04.105
Great.

13:04.205 --> 13:06.705
I got an invitation to the launch party.
Are you bringing anyone?

13:06.805 --> 13:10.705
No, no way. No. I don't mix
my private life with my work life.

13:10.805 --> 13:12.485
- Really?
- Never.

13:12.585 --> 13:15.865
Because I was gonna bring
Simone along. She texted me.

13:15.965 --> 13:19.065
- But if that's not cool, then...
- No, no, it's fine. That's great.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.945
You should bring her along.

13:21.045 --> 13:23.925
Yeah, she's fun. Definitely invite her.

13:23.965 --> 13:25.785
Definitely. Yeah, you should.

13:25.845 --> 13:27.565
I'll call her, then.

13:27.605 --> 13:29.705
Great.

13:45.765 --> 13:46.705
Wow.

13:47.885 --> 13:50.585
You can really see a lot of detail
on that thing.

13:50.645 --> 13:53.025
Life size.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.945
- He looks nice. How old's he?
- Do you like him?

13:56.045 --> 13:57.785
Because I'm trying to find you
a boyfriend.

13:57.845 --> 13:58.845
Please don't.

13:58.945 --> 14:02.565
Well, you'll need one because Jack's
asked me to go to your launch party.

14:02.605 --> 14:04.225
I know.

14:04.325 --> 14:05.585
Do you think Jack and I
are a good match?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.865
Dunno.

14:07.925 --> 14:09.665
I don't know him very well, but...

14:09.725 --> 14:11.265
But what?

14:11.365 --> 14:14.585
He's very different to the type of
person you've been out with before.

14:14.685 --> 14:17.225
He doesn't drink, he doesn't take drugs,

14:17.285 --> 14:19.065
he's not a party guy.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.305
That's exactly what I need.

14:20.405 --> 14:22.505
- But that's not you.
- Could be.

14:22.565 --> 14:26.425
Oh, my God. Look, it's Lucas.

14:26.525 --> 14:29.385
- Why is he on Tinder?
- Ah, because you two broke up.

14:29.445 --> 14:30.905
And he's a massive dickhead.

14:30.965 --> 14:33.025
We all have our idiosyncrasies.

14:33.085 --> 14:35.345
"Idiosyncrasies" you say?

14:42.405 --> 14:44.665
Haven't you guys been to bed yet?

14:44.765 --> 14:47.305
- Nope!
- Not planning to!

14:50.645 --> 14:55.225
Hey. Jump in, Lil.
This is my new best friend Samantha.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.985
Ah, it's Cassandra.

14:57.045 --> 14:59.425
Lily! Lily!

15:01.625 --> 15:02.785
It's Lucas and me.

15:03.845 --> 15:05.665
Do you love it?

15:07.325 --> 15:08.305
I'm going to bed.

15:08.405 --> 15:11.425
Before you go, I just want to get
clear on your boyfriend preferences.

15:11.525 --> 15:13.645
I don't want you to find me a boyfriend.

15:13.745 --> 15:17.345
Now, is 65 too old, because that can
be a very good age for a man.

15:17.405 --> 15:18.425
Yes.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.585
OK. Change that.

15:19.645 --> 15:20.985
And is it just men,

15:21.085 --> 15:23.665
or can you finally open yourself up
to other choices?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.905
OK. Change that too.

15:41.785 --> 15:44.705
Hey, um, can I leave you in charge?

15:44.765 --> 15:46.305
I feel terrible.

15:46.405 --> 15:48.785
- What's wrong?
- Oh, it's just morning sickness.

15:48.845 --> 15:50.665
Wow.

15:50.765 --> 15:53.845
Did you just look at your watch
to see if it was still the morning?

15:53.885 --> 15:54.945
No, I...

15:55.045 --> 15:58.485
I looked at my watch to check
the time. And, yes, it's 3pm.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.985
So, can you do it? You'll have to
stay and close up at eight.

16:03.085 --> 16:06.665
I can't tonight. I've got to review
that band at the Corner Hotel.

16:06.725 --> 16:09.745
Oh. No, that's fine. I can stay.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.845
No, no, no, you go home.
You want me to walk you?

16:12.885 --> 16:13.925
I'm gonna be sick again.

16:14.025 --> 16:16.945
Yeah, definitely, definitely go home.

16:19.405 --> 16:21.905
So we need all the top-off shots.

16:22.005 --> 16:25.545
OK, John, I think this is the right mix.

16:25.605 --> 16:27.945
This is the stuff we want.

16:28.045 --> 16:30.985
- Really? I'd do way less of it.
- It's about balance, Nikkii.

16:31.085 --> 16:33.705
He's a good-looking guy,
let's not shy away from that.

16:33.765 --> 16:34.845
But it's not a dating show.

16:34.925 --> 16:37.425
- I wish it was.
- It's not.

16:37.485 --> 16:39.545
OK...

16:39.645 --> 16:41.505
Top and tail it
with him at the barbecue,

16:41.605 --> 16:45.125
get rid of all the close-ups on his
body and please lose the slow-mo.

16:45.165 --> 16:46.785
I mean... we could try that.

16:46.845 --> 16:48.905
I just... I think it's gonna work.

16:49.005 --> 16:50.265
- Can you do that?
- Sure.

16:50.365 --> 16:54.265
Hey, guys. Lily, I need you
to have a look at something for me.

16:54.365 --> 16:56.205
I'll be five minutes.
I'm just finishing up in here.

16:56.245 --> 16:58.025
I kind of need you now. It's urgent.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.145
OK.

17:00.205 --> 17:01.345
Just...

17:03.425 --> 17:05.545
I'm really pushed for time, so...

17:05.645 --> 17:10.025
I've been thinking about the
new segment and I've decided...

17:11.345 --> 17:13.845
...to focus on climate change.

17:13.885 --> 17:15.305
We already do a lot on that.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.625
- But not from a personal perspective.
- That sounds amazing.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.984
For example, if I want to
go on holiday to Fiji,

17:22.085 --> 17:26.265
there are some islands I can't actually
go to now because they're sinking.

17:26.365 --> 17:28.665
What if I book the holiday
and the island disappears?

17:28.725 --> 17:30.225
Would I get my money back?

17:30.325 --> 17:33.065
Probably, because I'd have
travel insurance, but...

17:33.165 --> 17:34.985
...it would still be
pretty inconvenient.

17:35.045 --> 17:36.545
What do you think?

17:36.645 --> 17:40.145
Fantastic. I'll write something up
and you let me know what you think.

17:40.205 --> 17:41.345
Great. Ah, before you go...

17:41.445 --> 17:42.945
Um...

17:43.045 --> 17:45.205
I had Alice work on something
for the new segment.

17:45.285 --> 17:48.385
Alice, can you bring up the... you know.

17:48.445 --> 17:50.545
Now...

17:50.645 --> 17:53.845
...if we're going with climate change,

17:53.925 --> 17:56.305
which amount of facial hair do you
think looks best?

17:59.065 --> 18:00.762
That one.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.637
- Really?
- Yep.

18:02.746 --> 18:05.020
Please tell me you're
still coming tonight?

18:05.045 --> 18:06.385
Um, Lily...

18:06.445 --> 18:07.765
Lily.

18:07.805 --> 18:09.545
What about this one?

18:09.605 --> 18:11.545
That one's my favourite.

18:11.605 --> 18:14.025
Um... it's good too.

18:14.085 --> 18:16.785
They're... all...

18:24.159 --> 18:25.850
I'm here... where are you?

18:36.765 --> 18:39.145
Hi. I'm late. I'm so sorry.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.765
Oh, thanks.

18:40.805 --> 18:42.785
Work is a nightmare.

18:42.810 --> 18:45.985
I'm trying to sort this promo
to keep the new chef happy

18:46.085 --> 18:49.125
and Eric has this thing
about his facial hair.

18:49.165 --> 18:50.585
It is doing my head in.

18:50.645 --> 18:51.845
Wow, you have got problems.

18:51.925 --> 18:53.625
I've got nothing going on
except 48 hours from now

18:53.725 --> 18:55.305
I have to make a decision
that's going to affect me

18:55.365 --> 18:56.505
until the day that I die.

18:57.725 --> 19:00.265
And it's back to you.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.985
So, how pregnant is Meredith?

19:07.045 --> 19:09.625
I dunno. Not very.

19:09.725 --> 19:13.305
So, you had sex with her
and with me in very close proximity.

19:13.405 --> 19:16.125
- I thought we packed this away.
- We did.

19:16.165 --> 19:17.625
We packed it away.

19:17.685 --> 19:21.185
But... we didn't seal it.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.385
- Oh, no.
- What?

19:25.445 --> 19:27.265
It's Bernard the cock.

19:27.365 --> 19:30.225
Hey.

19:30.325 --> 19:32.765
Oh, my God. How are you? Are you good?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.265
Are you reviewing tonight, eh?

19:35.325 --> 19:37.985
Ah... why do you use air quotes?

19:38.085 --> 19:40.225
Does 'reviewing' mean
something else to you?

19:40.325 --> 19:41.945
- Using it in some sort of ironic way?
- Whoa! Calm down.

19:42.045 --> 19:44.125
He's become a bit of a word Nazi
since I last saw him.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.485
Um...

19:46.565 --> 19:48.545
- Yeah.
- So who are you here for tonight?

19:48.645 --> 19:52.025
I am here for an app. Yeah, music app.

19:52.085 --> 19:53.425
That's what I do these days.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.065
I just realised that
that's where the moolah is.

19:55.165 --> 19:57.305
It's sort of paying really well.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.629
Actually, I just remember
I sent you a friend request...

19:59.654 --> 20:01.665
What time are you planning to close up?

20:01.725 --> 20:03.865
Closing up now. Everything OK?

20:03.965 --> 20:05.705
Just when you can,
make sure you accept it.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.729
Give me a call.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.585
Oh, I didn't know that you could...
Are you OK?

20:11.645 --> 20:13.265
Yeah, I just have to call Meredith.

20:13.365 --> 20:14.825
Perfect. That's cool.
We'll just hang in here.

20:14.925 --> 20:17.265
Yeah, you do that. We'll just
hang in here. We'll chat.

20:17.365 --> 20:19.825
- I'll... I'll go outside with you.
- Yeah.

20:19.925 --> 20:21.625
I just remembered,
I've gotta talk to the roadie...

20:21.725 --> 20:23.665
- Yeah, cool.
- Walk.

20:23.725 --> 20:25.425
Hey, can I ask you something?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.345
I want you to give me
your honest answer.

20:27.445 --> 20:29.945
- What should I do?
- Oh, Pete.

20:30.005 --> 20:31.845
Only you can know that.

20:31.885 --> 20:33.025
Please.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.545
I don't know if I'd be a very good dad.

20:37.245 --> 20:41.625
- Silence is always a vote of confidence.
- No, I'm sorry.

20:41.685 --> 20:44.825
You'd... you'd be a great dad.

20:44.885 --> 20:46.665
It's just...

20:46.765 --> 20:49.905
...I never expected we'd be having
this conversation.

20:49.965 --> 20:52.065
You think I expected it?

20:54.065 --> 20:55.505
I'm gonna call her.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.170
Hey, is everything OK?
Just closing up now.

20:58.782 --> 21:00.782
So... you haven't closed up yet?

21:01.256 --> 21:04.260
- Nah... just closing up now.
- That's weird.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.980
Because the alarm went off
and I'm here now.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.300
So... where exactly are you?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.980
Hiding in the fridge? Under the table?

21:12.080 --> 21:14.420
OK, I'm clearly not there.
I'm at the gig.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.380
That went way worse than I expected.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.160
Really? 'Cause that went
exactly how I expected.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.940
Let's go back in.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.100
Sorry. No pass outs.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.380
Oh, I don't want to pass out,
I want to pass in.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.300
I'm press. I work for Live.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.880
I've been in, went out to make
a call, now I want to go back in.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.460
I don't know how you got out,
'cause there's no pass outs.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.520
Clearly we did get out,
because we are quite literally out.

21:47.035 --> 21:49.535
- You can't go back in.
- Can we buy two more tickets, then?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.220
Nuh. Gig's full.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.060
Well, we've already been in there,

21:53.120 --> 21:54.340
so the gig can't be full.

21:54.440 --> 21:58.560
In fact, it's technically less than
two full because we're out here.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.820
Right.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.060
How do you think
this conversation's gonna end?

22:09.640 --> 22:11.200
- Look at this.
- What's your plan?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.940
Ah! Oh!

22:15.480 --> 22:17.468
- Ah... you OK?
- Ah.

22:17.493 --> 22:18.980
I think I'm stuck.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.780
Take my skirt off.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.580
I'd feel weird taking off your skirt.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.460
A pity you didn't feel weird
about it the other night.

22:26.520 --> 22:27.740
Yeah, that is uncool.

22:29.060 --> 22:30.420
OK, buckle.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.500
- That's a tricky one.
- There's a zip.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.460
- What is this thing?
- It's not that hard.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.820
Pull!

22:36.880 --> 22:37.980
I'm pulling.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.660
Eh!

22:39.720 --> 22:41.380
For God's sake!

22:42.880 --> 22:44.980
What the hell is going on here?

22:48.120 --> 22:49.700
Hello?!

22:51.120 --> 22:53.300
You're lucky he didn't call the police.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.980
- That looked really, really bad for you.
- You told me to take off your skirt.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.140
I know, but you probably
shouldn't have done it.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.740
He said you could have been charged
with assault.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.260
Just... let me listen.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.420
If I can hear it, I can
legitimately write about it, OK?

23:09.980 --> 23:12.140
Hey...

23:12.240 --> 23:14.100
...if you spend the night with someone

23:14.200 --> 23:16.460
and they don't want to sleep with you,

23:16.560 --> 23:18.300
even though you want to
have sex with them,

23:18.400 --> 23:22.740
does it mean that A, they respect
you, so they want to wait?

23:22.800 --> 23:25.020
B, that they want a slow burn?

23:25.120 --> 23:27.380
Or C, they're just not that into you?

23:27.440 --> 23:28.980
Who'd you have sex with?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.060
It wasn't me, it was Simone.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.920
- I don't know. Is this someone a man?
- Yes.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.740
- Then, C.
- Interesting.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.100
Why do you say that?

23:38.200 --> 23:40.500
Because if I go to bed with someone,
I have sex with them. All men do.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.780
Oh, no, they don't.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.060
Yeah, they do.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.860
Um... you and I have slept in
the same bed heaps of times

23:46.920 --> 23:48.700
and we didn't have sex.

23:49.780 --> 23:51.700
I always wanted to.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.340
Ding-dong! It's me.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.460
- Good night?
- Ah, very nice, yeah.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.140
Yeah? Well, next time, Miss Lily,
you come with me, alright?

24:01.240 --> 24:04.340
I can get you into any gig in town.
I would never leave you outside.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.980
Oh, I don't mind being outside.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.780
It's quite nice. It's actually
my location of choice.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.700
Well, good to know. But if you ever
need work again, just let me know.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.380
Give me a call. Uh, uh, uh.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.620
Yeah? Oh, there you go.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.220
I get offered so many shitty jobs
that I just don't want to do.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.780
They're annoying, believe me.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.920
But if you want to do it, I reckon
they'd be right up your alley.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.500
Think about it, give me a call.
See you guys later.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.260
Peace out.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.100
Yeah, night.

24:38.980 --> 24:41.300
Alright, so, I've been thinking
about what I want to say to Meredith

24:41.360 --> 24:44.200
and this is where I'm heading, OK?

24:44.300 --> 24:46.860
- Meredith, I want you to be happy...
- Don't say "but".

24:47.000 --> 24:48.940
- How'd you know I was gonna say "but"?
- Go on.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.020
- ...however...
- That's a fancy "but".

24:51.080 --> 24:53.920
- What?
- You guys having sex again or something?

24:55.320 --> 24:56.580
Er, my editor just texted.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.380
Apparently there are some
new comments on the blog.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.200
"There was a restless vibe
amongst the crowd

25:07.240 --> 25:08.940
"like the vibe you get

25:09.040 --> 25:11.020
"when you know for sure
something good's going to happen,

25:11.120 --> 25:13.940
"but you don't know how good
and what exactly it's going to be."

25:14.000 --> 25:15.420
That's cool.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.840
"I was at that concert and that's
exactly what it was like."

25:17.940 --> 25:20.500
"I don't even know this band
but they sound mighty."

25:20.600 --> 25:22.260
- "Wish I was there."
- Scroll down.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.740
- "Loved this concert, man."
- Scroll down.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.480
"I'm surprised you didn't speak more
about their stage presence.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.940
"Were you actually there?"

25:29.040 --> 25:30.620
- Who's that from?
- The Scrutiniser.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.840
- Might be the only one.
- Scroll down.

25:32.940 --> 25:35.580
"Hard to review a band
when you're not actually there.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.740
"This reviewer left at 7:55pm."

25:37.800 --> 25:39.560
Bloody Bernard.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.980
Oh, dear. That's my editor.

25:47.260 --> 25:48.500
Hello.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.700
I... no, I was there.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.780
I just had to step outside
to make a call

25:52.880 --> 25:54.580
and then they wouldn't let me
back in afterwards.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.500
No, no, that's not right.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.940
I could actually hear the whole thing...

25:59.000 --> 26:00.860
No, I do take it seriously.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.700
I couldn't take it any more seriously.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.480
If I took it any more seriously I'd...

26:04.580 --> 26:07.840
Yep. Sure.
I won't say 'seriously' again.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.100
OK.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.700
Yep.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.940
- I'm gonna go.
- Don't go.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.840
- What did your boss say?
- Ah...

26:19.880 --> 26:21.940
I blew it.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.300
- Hey!
- Hi.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.560
Do you want me to do coffees
this morning?

26:37.600 --> 26:38.940
Ah, no.

26:39.040 --> 26:42.300
If you could do food,
that'd work better for me.

26:43.460 --> 26:47.700
You know, if we're gonna have
any sort of a relationship...

26:48.780 --> 26:50.260
...you can't lie to me.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.020
- OK.
- Don't just say "OK," Pete.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.580
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say what you think.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.420
OK, here's what I think.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.780
I think I shouldn't have lied to you.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.740
I think I had to lie to you.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.420
I'm trying to build a career,
I'm trying to offer you something.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.480
I've got all these balls in the air.

27:06.580 --> 27:08.780
Your coffee shop, my work,
you being pregnant,

27:08.880 --> 27:11.860
me trying to figure out
what the hell I should do, and...

27:11.960 --> 27:14.840
...balancing them all is like
balancing 20 plates on a chopstick.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.200
It's impossible.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.860
And even though I know it's impossible,

27:17.960 --> 27:20.700
I'm still trying to do it because
obviously I'm a fucking idiot.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.645
Listen up.

27:36.745 --> 27:39.805
Welcome everyone to the celebration
of the new season

27:39.865 --> 27:41.565
of The Breakfast Bar.

27:44.065 --> 27:46.805
We're pretty excited about the year
that's coming up. Particularly Jack.

27:46.865 --> 27:48.265
Yes!

27:48.345 --> 27:50.205
Who's brought his culinary delights
to the show.

27:50.305 --> 27:52.285
- Have you seen this?
- I saw a rough cut.

27:52.385 --> 27:55.325
Have a look at the new promo
that's going to air next week.

27:59.665 --> 28:02.365
<i>It's going to be</i>

28:02.425 --> 28:06.685
<i>a long, hot summer.</i>

28:11.105 --> 28:14.325
<i>And nowhere's going to be as hot...</i>

28:14.385 --> 28:17.365
<i>...as The Breakfast Bar.</i>

28:21.205 --> 28:24.605
<i>Our new chef is sizzling.</i>

28:28.185 --> 28:30.185
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

28:30.225 --> 28:31.725
That... that's amazing.

28:31.825 --> 28:34.905
You're a bloody good sport.
But, mate, hilarious.

28:34.945 --> 28:37.325
Lil, that was sick as.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.915
I loved how there was no actual
cooking in the segment.

28:39.940 --> 28:41.565
It was kind of postmodern.

28:41.665 --> 28:44.205
And a big round of applause to
Nikkii and Lily

28:44.265 --> 28:46.005
who conceived the promo.

28:46.105 --> 28:48.485
Oh, it was... it was mainly Nikkii.

28:48.545 --> 28:50.185
We nailed it!

28:50.225 --> 28:53.525
Yeah! Heeeeeey!

28:53.625 --> 28:56.205
- Good promo.
- Thank you.

28:56.265 --> 28:59.325
A bit misleading, but still... good.

28:59.425 --> 29:02.045
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

29:02.145 --> 29:04.365
Looks like someone's balls
have had a puncture.

29:04.425 --> 29:06.325
I've got to go and talk to Jack.

29:09.945 --> 29:11.845
Are you OK?

29:11.945 --> 29:13.765
- Is that what you think of me?
- What?

29:13.865 --> 29:17.205
That promo. Do you see
that's what I have to offer?

29:17.305 --> 29:20.565
I think... your brand is very valuable

29:20.665 --> 29:23.365
and I'm keen to promote it
in any way I can.

29:23.425 --> 29:24.685
Stop talking like a TV producer.

29:24.785 --> 29:27.085
I'm not a brand or a product,
I'm a person.

29:27.185 --> 29:30.265
I made a promo that will bring
people to the breakfast show.

29:30.305 --> 29:32.925
You looked hot, you are hot.

29:33.025 --> 29:35.685
Is there anything wrong with that?
Everybody loves it.

29:35.745 --> 29:37.965
I trusted you, and I believed you.

29:38.065 --> 29:39.545
Why didn't you tell me you had no regard

29:39.585 --> 29:40.925
for what I think or what I want?

29:41.025 --> 29:44.205
You're overreacting.
It's beautiful. You should feel proud.

29:44.305 --> 29:48.185
Well, I don't.
I feel stupid and embarrassed.

29:48.225 --> 29:49.605
How do you feel?

29:59.705 --> 30:01.125
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:01.185 --> 30:02.205
Have you seen Jack?

30:02.305 --> 30:04.605
Ah, yeah. He's just round the corner.

30:05.985 --> 30:08.085
Oh. That's him. He wants to get going.

30:08.145 --> 30:10.399
I said I'd drop him home.

30:10.783 --> 30:12.892
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:24.338 --> 30:26.943
Hi.

30:27.299 --> 30:29.119
Are you OK?

30:30.025 --> 30:33.545
I'm... I'm really sorry
about last night.

30:33.585 --> 30:35.845
Look, I get it.

30:37.105 --> 30:39.325
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

30:52.045 --> 30:54.185
Is this just a sex thing for you?

30:58.825 --> 30:59.925
I don't know.

31:14.745 --> 31:17.125
- Jack's not happy with the promo.
- Why not?

31:17.225 --> 31:19.205
He thinks it's exploitative.
I think if we recut it...

31:19.305 --> 31:21.605
We're not recutting.
The network love it. I love it.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.185
You told me to keep the talent happy.

31:23.285 --> 31:25.365
Look, the ship has sailed.
We're going with the promo.

31:29.025 --> 31:31.445
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:31.505 --> 31:32.925
Is your flatmate dating the chef?

31:32.985 --> 31:34.405
Not really.

31:34.505 --> 31:37.125
I take that as a yes.
Is this weird for you?

31:37.185 --> 31:39.125
Why would it be?

31:39.225 --> 31:42.205
Because having someone that hot
around that you can't touch,

31:42.265 --> 31:44.245
that would send me crazy.

31:44.305 --> 31:46.005
I don't see him that way.

31:49.345 --> 31:53.565
Finding out I was pregnant
was a dream come true for me.

31:53.665 --> 31:56.405
- And you made that happen.
- OK.

31:56.505 --> 31:59.965
I'm 42 years old and my ex and I
tried IVF for 10 years,

32:00.025 --> 32:01.565
it cost us a fortune.

32:01.665 --> 32:05.765
We ended up with broken hearts
and no baby.

32:05.865 --> 32:11.085
And... I'd accepted that
I wouldn't have a child.

32:11.145 --> 32:14.725
And now I have one inside of me.

32:14.825 --> 32:18.125
And you made that happen.

32:19.465 --> 32:23.445
I need to know what... what you want.

32:23.545 --> 32:26.605
'Cause this is our baby.
It's not just mine.

32:26.665 --> 32:28.585
Er...

32:30.945 --> 32:34.925
Getting pregnant was not
in my immediate plan.

32:34.985 --> 32:37.085
Nor mine.

32:37.185 --> 32:43.845
I just think that this is the wrong
time for me to have a child.

32:43.905 --> 32:45.685
And what does that mean?

32:45.745 --> 32:48.685
It means I care about you so much,

32:48.745 --> 32:50.045
but...

32:50.145 --> 32:52.285
...I'd like to work on
our relationship first

32:52.345 --> 32:56.005
and then decide if we want a child.

32:56.065 --> 32:58.685
Meredith, my dad was a shit father.

32:58.745 --> 33:00.485
I don't want to repeat that.

33:00.585 --> 33:02.605
Well, you should have
worn a condom, then.

33:03.745 --> 33:05.185
Fair enough.

33:05.285 --> 33:07.645
I've got a business and a life already,

33:07.705 --> 33:09.845
and I can have a child on my own.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.545
I don't need you.

33:11.585 --> 33:13.605
So what's this conversation about?

33:13.705 --> 33:17.765
It was supposed to be about you
deciding what level of involvement

33:17.865 --> 33:20.125
you wanted to have in your baby's life.

33:20.225 --> 33:22.685
Can't we take a step back and decide
if we even want a baby together?

33:24.405 --> 33:25.825
No.

33:38.405 --> 33:39.685
Vesper?

33:39.745 --> 33:41.285
No, thanks.

33:41.345 --> 33:43.845
Jack is making dinner.

33:43.905 --> 33:44.885
That's a real treat.

33:44.985 --> 33:47.825
- A famous chef making us dinner.
- Mm.

33:47.925 --> 33:50.185
How is it for you two working
together? Are you enjoying it?

33:50.285 --> 33:52.405
- It's fun.
- I'm not enjoying it.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.005
The cooking promo made me feel like

33:54.105 --> 33:56.125
Lily truly hasn't been listening to me.

33:56.185 --> 33:57.905
I'm listening to you now.

33:57.985 --> 33:59.765
Little late for that, don't you think?

33:59.825 --> 34:02.185
Jack, I'm doing my best.

34:02.285 --> 34:05.765
I'm trying to juggle your needs
against the show's needs

34:05.865 --> 34:09.185
and I'm sorry if you're not happy,
but I'm doing my best.

34:12.685 --> 34:15.205
I'm... gonna go to my mum's.

34:15.264 --> 34:16.764
No, don't do that.

34:16.824 --> 34:18.705
Look, this is your home.

34:19.764 --> 34:21.735
Please stay and have dinner.

34:23.125 --> 34:24.947
Don't tell me what to do.

34:35.516 --> 34:37.710
So, Simone's going out with Jack.

34:37.819 --> 34:39.532
The new chef on our show.

34:39.625 --> 34:41.143
Ooh. I love him.

34:41.145 --> 34:43.467
Settle down.

34:44.745 --> 34:46.485
- And now Pete...
- Oh.

34:46.545 --> 34:48.764
What is Pete up to?

34:48.864 --> 34:51.445
Got this woman pregnant even though
they're not really together.

34:52.121 --> 34:53.542
Wow.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.985
Wait...

34:56.085 --> 35:00.125
...wait a minute, was this
before or after you and Pete...

35:00.193 --> 35:01.913
Before.

35:01.945 --> 35:03.732
And after.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.085
Who is this woman?

35:06.125 --> 35:08.225
This older woman, Meredith.

35:08.325 --> 35:10.105
She owns the coffee shop Pete works in.

35:11.565 --> 35:15.522
Mum, if he has a baby,
our lives are gonna go like... that.

35:25.405 --> 35:27.865
So, you wanna stay the night?

35:27.925 --> 35:29.065
Yeah.

35:30.265 --> 35:31.336
- Mum?
- Hm?

35:31.361 --> 35:34.745
- Can I move back in with you?
- No.

35:41.405 --> 35:44.025
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>
- Hi.

35:44.085 --> 35:45.665
So, the talk happened.

35:45.725 --> 35:48.005
It was quick, no winners.

35:48.085 --> 35:50.345
Lily, tell me, if you were pregnant...

35:50.445 --> 35:53.185
- To... to you?
- <i>Yeah, yeah, to me.</i>

35:53.245 --> 35:55.065
What would you want to hear?

35:55.125 --> 35:56.385
<i>Pete, I'm not Meredith.</i>

35:56.485 --> 35:58.465
No, no.
What would you, Lily, want to hear?

36:02.065 --> 36:05.345
"I love you and I care about you

36:05.445 --> 36:08.505
"and I'll support you in any way I can."

36:10.805 --> 36:13.169
<i>While the world
tries to find a global solution</i>

36:13.194 --> 36:15.425
<i>to this environmental tragedy...</i>

36:17.765 --> 36:19.825
<i>...I find my attention turns inward.</i>

36:21.265 --> 36:25.385
<i>You know, it's not hard to remember
the Australia I used to know.</i>

36:25.485 --> 36:28.925
<i>I spent my childhood mucking
around in creeks, climbing trees,</i>

36:28.965 --> 36:31.645
<i>running through lush paddocks.</i>

36:31.725 --> 36:33.285
I didn't know you grew
up in the country.

36:33.385 --> 36:36.005
- Geelong.
- Oh.

36:36.045 --> 36:37.585
Have a look around now.

36:39.925 --> 36:41.185
All gone.

36:43.965 --> 36:45.345
All gone.

36:48.645 --> 36:50.025
And now all I can say is...

36:51.625 --> 36:52.945
...cry...

36:54.425 --> 36:56.305
...my beloved country.

36:58.125 --> 36:59.705
<i>Cry.</i>

37:07.005 --> 37:08.985
- I love it.
- Thank you.

37:09.085 --> 37:11.425
It's got everything...
drama, poetry, humour.

37:11.485 --> 37:12.585
That was my idea.

37:12.685 --> 37:14.865
But, hey, I didn't do it all on my own.

37:14.965 --> 37:17.025
- And thank you, Lily.
- That's alright.

37:17.125 --> 37:18.825
This could be something for prime time.

37:18.925 --> 37:21.345
I'm seeing a special,
or even a series of specials.

37:21.445 --> 37:23.825
- I love that idea! Don't you, Lily?
- Yeah.

37:23.925 --> 37:25.665
- Leave it with me.
- OK.

37:31.685 --> 37:33.785
Are we really doing
a series of specials?

37:33.885 --> 37:35.745
Budgets are pretty tight at the moment.

37:35.805 --> 37:37.385
Good work.

37:37.485 --> 37:39.145
I think his balls
are well and truly inflated.

37:40.365 --> 37:41.505
Thank you.

37:44.685 --> 37:46.025
Hey!

37:46.125 --> 37:48.705
That could not have gone better.
She loved it!

37:48.765 --> 37:50.817
You and me, we're a good team.

37:50.842 --> 37:52.215
Yes.

37:52.403 --> 37:55.105
<i>It's going to be a long, hot...</i>

37:55.165 --> 37:56.225
Hi, Eric.

37:56.325 --> 37:57.785
- Alice.
- <i>...summer.</i>

37:58.863 --> 38:03.745
<i>And nowhere is going to be as hot
as The Breakfast Bar.</i>

38:03.845 --> 38:05.465
I don't know how we managed to do it,

38:05.565 --> 38:07.985
but we made Jack look hotter
than he already is.

38:08.045 --> 38:09.505
He is gorgeous.

38:09.565 --> 38:11.225
He's uber gorgeous.

38:11.285 --> 38:13.105
Genetically blessed.

38:13.205 --> 38:16.505
He's gonna bring
a whole new audience to the show.

38:16.565 --> 38:18.385
Really? I don't think so.

38:18.445 --> 38:20.185
Oh, he will. He definitely will.

38:20.285 --> 38:24.285
I think what we've done with Jack is
capture, like, a star in the making.

38:24.325 --> 38:26.185
Not sure about that.

38:28.065 --> 38:29.025
Oh.

38:29.865 --> 38:30.865
Oh.

38:32.065 --> 38:33.945
Hey! Hey.

38:35.145 --> 38:36.105
Um...

38:38.125 --> 38:41.925
You know, I... really respect
the work you did on that promo.

38:43.005 --> 38:45.105
Really. But don't you think
it's a bit...

38:47.205 --> 38:48.465
...sexist.

38:48.565 --> 38:52.285
I mean, how many shots were there
of that... guy with his shirt off?

38:52.325 --> 38:53.565
Ah.

38:55.365 --> 38:57.145
I hope I'm not overstepping
the mark, but...

38:57.205 --> 38:59.465
But what?

39:00.483 --> 39:04.705
I don't think a celebrity chef
should provoke us like that.

39:04.749 --> 39:07.413
The focus should be on the hosts
of the show, you and Erica.

39:07.592 --> 39:10.285
I'm not saying don't promote him,
I'm just saying...

39:10.365 --> 39:12.345
...I don't know, maybe they have a plan.

39:12.405 --> 39:14.065
What sort of plan?

39:14.165 --> 39:16.865
- Don't know.
- What do you mean?

39:18.165 --> 39:20.985
All I'm gonna say is it seems
a little bit strange to me

39:21.085 --> 39:23.145
that someone who's just joined the show

39:23.205 --> 39:25.925
is getting promoted in that way.

39:29.125 --> 39:30.345
Do...

39:32.685 --> 39:35.945
...do you think it's going
to damage my profile at all?

39:36.005 --> 39:38.065
No. Not at all.

39:38.165 --> 39:40.385
He may be hot but you have... gravitas.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.025
He's not that hot.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.505
Well played, my friend, well played.

39:51.565 --> 39:52.565
Thank you.

40:15.085 --> 40:17.679
- Hey.
- Mm. Ooh.

40:18.380 --> 40:20.175
- Sorry.
- No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.460
- Hey.
- Mm.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.880
What are you doing?

40:22.940 --> 40:24.897
Oh, thanks.

40:26.540 --> 40:28.760
OK.

40:29.531 --> 40:31.031
Oof.

40:39.893 --> 40:42.140
That feels nice.

40:42.338 --> 40:43.578
Mm.

40:46.141 --> 40:50.040
Hey, I love you and I'll support
you in any way I can.

40:50.764 --> 40:52.610
OK? I'm not going anywhere.

41:09.987 --> 41:13.480
And last but not least,
Jack's promo is not going to air.

41:13.547 --> 41:15.965
What?! That promo was amazing!

41:16.000 --> 41:17.060
There's no point arguing.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.220
Eric has dropped his bundle
so Jack's promo is dead.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.060
We're starting again. Put a shirt
on him and get him cooking.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.380
And work up a new promo for Eric,
nothing with his shirt on.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.860
Sure.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.540
Seems his balls
were well and truly punctured.

41:51.660 --> 41:53.220
You made the promo go away.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.040
Yep.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.620
- Did you like it?
- No.

42:00.720 --> 42:04.700
But it's... not my job to make
those sorts of decisions.

42:04.760 --> 42:06.220
Why didn't you tell me that?

42:07.538 --> 42:09.620
- Doesn't matter what I think.
- It matters to me.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.540
From now on, let's just be
completely honest with each other.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.505
Yep.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.620
Thank you.
