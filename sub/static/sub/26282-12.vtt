WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.603
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.607
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.945
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.282
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.953
-Previously on The Resident...
-MULLINS: And you're free to go.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.622
-What?
-You made bail.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.125
Let's get you your clothes
and get you out of here.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.460
-Well, have I convinced you?
-No, I did my homework.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.363
Your new VNS device
is top-rated. Cheers.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.332
You're telling me

00:31.365 --> 00:34.868
that Bell thinks these hands
killed Bradley Jenkins.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.105
(yells)

00:37.138 --> 00:39.039
-BENEDICT: You want my advice?
-Always.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.442
Learn humility.
You make a mistake, own it.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.312
-It'll make you a better doctor.
-I'm benching myself
from surgery

00:44.345 --> 00:47.181
-until further notice.
-How are things at the clinic
with Alec?

00:47.215 --> 00:51.185
-He seems to really care
about what we're doing.
-Mm.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.358
NIC:
Can I open my eyes yet?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.227
CONRAD:
Watch your step.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.996
NIC:
Conrad, where are we?

01:03.030 --> 01:06.434
What's that smell?
Is that banana bread?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.174
CONRAD:
Okay.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.577
Open them.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.182
It's coffee cake, the candle.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.751
Jane called me yesterday.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.019
JANE:
Owner's a friend.

01:26.053 --> 01:29.590
No open house yet, but
Dr. Hawkins caught my son's IBD

01:29.623 --> 01:32.426
last summer, so I owe him.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.262
What do you think?

01:34.295 --> 01:36.530
It's beautiful.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.699
No more overnight bags.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.569
Our own place.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.737
Wait, is this for us?

01:43.771 --> 01:48.176
(chuckles)
Yes, of course it's for us.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.043
I mean, look at this yard.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.414
We get a hot tub,

01:53.447 --> 01:55.616
-raise chickens.
-Chickens?

01:55.649 --> 01:56.917
(chuckles):
What?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.652
Yeah. Why not?

02:00.154 --> 02:03.957
And it's walking distance
from Chastain

02:03.991 --> 02:06.894
and two blocks
from Trini Taqueria.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.698
And I love all that.
Um...

02:10.731 --> 02:13.334
But I mean,
how are we gonna afford this?

02:15.503 --> 02:17.305
(sighs)
The rent's basically

02:17.338 --> 02:19.773
what we pay
for two places now, so...

02:19.807 --> 02:21.775
Look, take your time.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.012
Look around.
Just let me know by tonight.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.317
(siren wailing)

02:30.551 --> 02:31.785
(tires screech)

02:31.819 --> 02:33.821
(indistinct chatter)

02:38.526 --> 02:40.561
(man sneezes)

02:40.594 --> 02:41.995
Hey, what's your name?

02:42.029 --> 02:43.964
-Jenessa.
-Okay, what brought you in--

02:43.997 --> 02:45.966
cough, cold, chest pain?

02:45.999 --> 02:49.136
Do I get in faster
if I say all of them?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.205
(cough, vomits)

02:51.239 --> 02:53.274
Nausea and vomiting.
Got it.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.645
-Nurse Myrick is on her way.
-Good.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.647
-We need backup.
-As a patient.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.148
It's like half Atlanta
has the flu,

03:01.181 --> 03:02.383
and the other half
thinks they do.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.888
Smiles, what are you here for?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.790
I woke up this morning
with the chills,

03:09.823 --> 03:11.525
but I've never been
happier in my life.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.261
He's in love.
Don't get him started.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.496
(laughs)
Her name is Sue.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.131
(whispers): Oh, she has
this adorable cockapoo.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.768
-Hmm.
-But yeah, so we went out
for the first time last night,

03:20.801 --> 03:22.636
and I've never
felt this way before.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.472
It's... I mean, this girl...

03:24.505 --> 03:28.442
Gentlemen, how much more do
I got to hear about this chick?

03:28.476 --> 03:31.144
I came in with an eye problem,
now I wish it was my ears.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.046
(woman inhales sharply)

03:46.226 --> 03:48.061
(chuckling):
Whoa...

03:48.095 --> 03:49.430
I am so sorry.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.031
It's fine.
Kid's got a good arm.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.778
Hello, key lime pie.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.914
From admin, to boost morale.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.849
Oh, yeah.
We need it.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.285
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.322
IRVING (distorted):
No, get your own.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.523
Get your own!

04:15.556 --> 04:18.692
No communal food
during flu season.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.433
You're a monster, Pravesh.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.253
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.288
(Jessica chuckles)

05:00.901 --> 05:02.470
AUSTIN:
Listen up, people.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.938
For some of you,
Christmas has come again.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.108
-My 30-year-old hernia
goes to my man Dr. Tolman.
-Thank you, Raptor.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.811
I dig your tension-free mesh
repair method.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.546
Dr. Richter,

05:12.580 --> 05:15.082
my cholecystectomy
this morning is yours.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.283
Go with God.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.218
(quietly):
These are your patients.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.456
Were.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.458
Until Bradley's death

05:24.492 --> 05:27.695
opened my eyes
to my crippling ego.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.597
I have a penance to serve.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.600
So I am guest lecturing today
at Billings University.

05:32.633 --> 05:36.504
I figure I'd leave the cutting
to more humble hands.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.040
Dr. Nolan.
My splenectomy--

05:40.073 --> 05:42.710
-are you up to the task?
-You know it, man.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.645
-Mina will assist.
-Oh...

05:44.678 --> 05:47.014
up top.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.383
You know he's just
having me babysit you, right?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.689
-Thank you, Jessica.
-Mm-hmm.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.825
NOLAN:
Could somebody please give me
the surgical schedule

05:57.858 --> 05:59.493
for... for the CEO?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.529
Thank you.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.566
Have fun.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.351
GRAYSON:
Never been a fan of pineapple.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.253
You?

06:26.286 --> 06:28.388
I want to know who Gordon Page
did business with

06:28.422 --> 06:30.157
-before Chastain.
-Uh-huh.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.359
Find out everything
you can about

06:32.392 --> 06:34.695
"the man who may save medicine."

06:34.728 --> 06:37.164
But Chastain's already in
business with him, aren't we?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.500
Currently, yes.

06:39.533 --> 06:43.103
So... mind if I ask
why I'm doing research?

06:43.136 --> 06:45.439
Just... think of this
as an opportunity

06:45.473 --> 06:47.541
for you to keep this job.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.743
Got it. Oh, also,
my mom called again.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.011
She needs to talk with you.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.013
Um, I'll...

06:53.046 --> 06:55.415
-Yeah, I'll call her. Later.
-Thought you'd like to see this.

06:55.449 --> 06:58.486
(chuckles):
Oh.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.620
No, no, no.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.894
Yeah.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.428
Don't worry, Dr. B. I got you.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.097
Thank you, Grayson.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.868
You can go.

07:14.902 --> 07:15.936
(clicks tongue)
Oh, actually,

07:15.969 --> 07:17.437
I heard it's bad this year.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.272
Do you want me to swipe you
an extra flu shot?

07:19.306 --> 07:21.709
That's... No.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.444
That's not the way
shots work, so no.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.279
Oh.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.549
(sighs)
What am I looking at?

07:28.582 --> 07:30.450
Two more elective surgeries
have cancelled.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.588
This-this flu season
is killing us.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.956
How bad is it down there?

07:35.989 --> 07:37.891
-What you about, man, huh?
What you about?
-What's up, little man?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.760
-What's up, little...
-What's up, man?
What's your problem?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.562
-Man, are you kidding?
-I've been here
for six hours, man.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.263
-Oh, hell no.
-Come on,

07:43.296 --> 07:45.132
-you want to come at me?
-What you got?!

07:45.165 --> 07:47.935
-Come on, bro. Let's go!
-MULLINS: Hold it.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.770
-(grunts)
-Come here. Hey!

07:49.803 --> 07:51.639
Get over here.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.773
Ear muffs, on.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.608
Asses in seats,

07:54.642 --> 07:56.443
hands in pockets.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.013
Should we do something?

08:00.047 --> 08:02.315
-MULLINS: Look, we're all sick.
-I think she's got it covered.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.984
MULLINS:
And tired.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.454
But we're just... we're...
(grunts)

08:07.487 --> 08:10.290
We got... Oh, man...

08:10.323 --> 08:11.324
(panting):
Oh...

08:11.358 --> 08:13.360
Doc, do you want to help her?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.164
Hey. Hey!

08:17.197 --> 08:19.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, take it easy. All right.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.404
Okay. All right.
Let's see.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.596
How long have you been
running a fever?

08:48.629 --> 08:51.164
-No clue. I run hot. So I...
-(knocking)

08:51.198 --> 08:54.267
Heard a badass broke up
a fight in the ER.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.737
Nic. I was wondering
if I was gonna get to see you.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.972
-Of course I'd come see you.
-You didn't think
I'd page her?

08:59.006 --> 09:01.008
-Come on.
-Good boy.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.342
I heard a rumor you were
her favorite guard

09:02.375 --> 09:03.811
during her stint in prison.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.747
Yeah, and she was one
of my favorite inmates, too.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.617
Mm. Sorry to say, I have
no plans on going back there.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.151
How's your girlfriend?

09:11.184 --> 09:13.520
Oh, in Tampa. We broke up.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.522
-Oh.
-No, we'll stay friends.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.057
No, scratch that. No, we won't.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.525
So how are you lovebirds?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.562
Yeah. Good.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.798
So, you have any idea
what's wrong with me?

09:24.832 --> 09:27.567
Well, your blood work
shows very low platelets.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.003
-That doesn't sound good.
-Mm, you'll need a transfusion,

09:30.037 --> 09:31.504
but it's nothing to panic about.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.540
Yeah, she's right.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.644
Let us run a few tests.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.279
We'll figure this out.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.015
(scattered coughing)

09:42.049 --> 09:44.451
Where will I find Dr. Shaw?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.795
Dr. Bell. What a surprise.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.097
Please tell me you didn't come
all the way down here

09:57.130 --> 09:58.766
-to cut our funding.
-Oh, no.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.634
I can do that via e-mail.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.502
Then to what
do I owe this honor?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.705
Well, I understand you have an
expertise in infectious disease

10:04.738 --> 10:07.440
and flu season has
our ER short-staffed.

10:07.474 --> 10:11.278
You don't want paranoid patients
scaring off profitable ones.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.280
But I don't have privileges
at Chastain.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.516
Check again.
I had you instated.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.986
Well, then I'd be happy
to help thin the crowd.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.587
Glad to hear it.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.622
In exchange
for a few ultrasound machines.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.557
Oh, sorry.
They're all spoken for.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.259
Ah, too bad.
So am I.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.634
One ultrasound.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.736
-Three.
-Two.

10:35.769 --> 10:36.804
Done.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.854
An open splenectomy is faster.
Ten blade.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.757
MINA:
For the surgery, yes,
but not the recovery.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.492
And a minimally invasive
approach has less complications.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.094
Chastain has more
than adequate facilities

11:01.128 --> 11:03.130
to help Mr. Fleming
with his recovery.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.832
And the hospital bills
the insurance ten times more...

11:04.865 --> 11:06.666
No wonder Bell likes you.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.836
Allow me to make this
a teachable moment.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.203
Please don't.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.610
We're a perfect match.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.081
Is it weird if, when we're
married, I take her name?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.682
It was one date, Sam.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.852
Now get this, we're both
closer to our moms,

11:24.885 --> 11:27.687
love Thai fusion and trap music.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.289
So does most of Atlanta.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.690
She just went hiking
in Yosemite.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.625
I did the same hike last year.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.427
Match made in heaven.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.897
-So how's your breathing?
-Fine.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.331
Well, my heart's racing
a little bit,

11:38.365 --> 11:39.599
-but that's probably...
-Aw, don't say

11:39.632 --> 11:41.034
it's 'cause of Sue.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.737
Oh, come on man, you never felt
that connection with someone?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.542
Oh, you totally have.
Who is she? What happened?

11:49.576 --> 11:52.312
Don't tell me she got away.
Oh.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.781
I can't let that
happen with Sue.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.382
She leaves for Spain tonight.
I got to see her

11:55.415 --> 11:57.885
-before she goes. Am I good?
-You're dehydrated.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.888
I'm gonna keep you
for IV fluids.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.357
-Sit tight.
-(groans)

12:04.391 --> 12:06.026
ALEC:
I'm about to make
an announcement, so just

12:06.059 --> 12:08.728
sit tight, okay, you guys?
Please, please, please

12:08.762 --> 12:10.330
-keep thinking.
-Hey, what's going on?

12:10.363 --> 12:13.066
-Uh, right side.
-Ask him.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.668
You guys are together--
that's perfect.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.470
Um... okay, listen up.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.507
Okay, people, it's 1918, okay?
No microwaves,

12:20.540 --> 12:23.643
Babe Ruth is pitching,

12:23.676 --> 12:27.380
and life expectancy
drops 12 years.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.582
Anyone know why?
Was it World War I?

12:30.650 --> 12:33.153
Wrong.
War only killed nine million,

12:33.186 --> 12:36.356
but the Spanish flu
killed over 50 million people.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.424
(patients murmuring)

12:37.457 --> 12:39.526
Do I have your attention yet?

12:39.559 --> 12:42.062
All right?
I've divided you into thirds.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.597
Left side got their flu shots,
right side didn't.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.400
Middle group, you guys
can't seem to remember.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.469
Middle group, do better.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.438
Right side, stay.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.374
Left side, good news: you're
going home with a care bag.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.176
Chances are you'll catch
something worse waiting here.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.211
All right?

12:58.245 --> 13:00.513
-(indistinct chatter)
-Move for me, let's do it.
All right.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.015
Gonna get you all better,

13:02.049 --> 13:03.050
-promise.
-Thank you.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.520
It's like Moses
parting the Red Sea.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.057
(grunts softly)

13:10.090 --> 13:12.292
When the next wave comes,
get creative.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.101
I don't really want
to raise chickens.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.569
(sighs)
Definitely seemed like

13:22.602 --> 13:25.238
you wanted to raise
some chickens.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.274
Look, I don't have my heart
set on that place anyway.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.675
We could check out some others.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.543
Uh...

13:30.577 --> 13:31.811
I think I just...

13:31.845 --> 13:34.181
need a minute.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.517
I get it.
It's...

13:37.550 --> 13:39.586
a big decision.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.823
You called for
an extra set of eyes?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.492
Hey, yes.
Thank you for coming.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.961
We were hoping that
an infectious disease doctor

13:47.995 --> 13:50.063
could tell us
not to worry as much

13:50.097 --> 13:52.032
as we are.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.002
Our patient Meg has petechiae,
her fever's rising.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.804
Hasn't responded to treatment.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.074
-Leukocyte inclusions
in the cytoplasm of neutrophils.
-Right.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.143
And Dohle bodies
and toxic granulations.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.578
And she's around a high-risk
population in the jail.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.846
I mean, are we crazy,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.582
or could this be
a new, rampant flu?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.851
I'm hoping you're crazy,
but you might be right,

14:11.885 --> 14:13.786
which means we have to
assume the worst.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.323
It's possible Meg
has a type of flu

14:16.356 --> 14:18.391
that we don't even
have a name for yet.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.463
She could be highly contagious.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.032
Look out!

14:32.906 --> 14:34.874
* Hey, hey, hey... *

14:34.908 --> 14:36.509
ALEC:
We need to take precautions
until we know

14:36.543 --> 14:37.877
what we're dealing with.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.913
* Hey, hey, hey *

14:41.915 --> 14:43.984
* Hey, hey, hey... *

14:44.017 --> 14:46.486
Stop whatever it is
from spreading.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.288
CONRAD:
What we need to do

14:48.321 --> 14:50.657
is stop one patient
from becoming 1,000.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.659
(machines beeping)

14:52.692 --> 14:55.728
* Hey, hey, hey *

14:55.762 --> 14:57.364
Get your head up, get back, Meg.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.332
Deep breath for me.
Deep breath.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.501
It's okay, we're gonna
take care of you.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.802
-(coughing continues)
-Deep breath.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.804
Breathe in for me.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.421
Can I panic now?

15:21.454 --> 15:23.256
You call the CEO

15:23.290 --> 15:25.658
before you initiate quarantine
at his hospital.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.261
I know how you like to operate,
Dr. Hawkins, but it's a rule.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.297
There's a good chance
we contained this.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.199
You contained one patient.
I have to stay

15:32.232 --> 15:35.835
ahead of the curve to contain
fear among hundreds of patients

15:35.868 --> 15:38.571
-and an entire staff.
-You guys realize

15:38.605 --> 15:39.806
you're saying
the same thing, right?

15:39.839 --> 15:42.409
We all want to solve this
as soon as possible.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.748
What are the facts right now?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.783
At this point,
we only have theories,

15:50.817 --> 15:52.452
the leading one being
a possible epidemic

15:52.485 --> 15:54.487
-strain of flu.
-I've got something.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.125
It may not be infectious.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.893
Meg's taking levothyroxine
for low thyroid function.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.929
So we could have held off
on the tent

16:02.962 --> 16:05.765
-and all the speculation
it generates.
-No, because

16:05.798 --> 16:07.834
there's a better chance
this is infectious.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.803
Meg also said that some of the
inmates at the prison were sick.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.905
They could've had visitors
who traveled internationally.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.108
-I mean, she doesn't know.
-Jails are a nest for disease.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.509
This could be
where her symptoms started.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.546
Levothyroxine or jail.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.415
An etiological fork in the road.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.152
I'm not gonna gamble,

16:25.185 --> 16:27.154
so go down both avenues.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.756
Okay, I'll get her started
on broad-spectrum antibiotics

16:29.789 --> 16:30.957
and send a thyroid panel

16:30.990 --> 16:32.692
off to the lab,
but my gut instinct...

16:32.725 --> 16:33.993
-It came from the jail.
-Right.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.762
So I'll head there, try to find

16:35.795 --> 16:36.996
whoever or whatever
made Meg sick.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.731
I'll go with Alec.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.168
Are you sure you want
to go back there?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.103
I know the lay of the land.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.505
Well, handle this discreetly.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.675
Rumors of an outbreak
are just gonna fuel the chaos.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.716
We have to thin the ER again
before a riot breaks out.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.586
Dr. Shaw said to get creative.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.822
Ooh. M... Mm, I got nothing.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.394
Okay, listen up.

17:07.427 --> 17:10.330
If your temperature checked in
over 100 go to the left.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.499
If you're over 65 or have
a chronic medical condition,

17:12.532 --> 17:14.501
make your way to the right.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.370
-Uh, who are these people
and why are they in VIP?
-Flu patients.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.839
ER's overflowing,
but you've got space.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.175
Orders came from you-know-who
from you-know-where.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.211
We'll be out in 90 minutes flat.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.682
Thinking outside the box
might lead to Bell

17:29.716 --> 17:32.085
putting our medical careers
in a pine box.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.758
Never thought
I'd be back here so soon.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.260
As a nurse?

17:40.293 --> 17:43.363
Inmate.
Cell block 6.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.332
Relax. I was framed
for breaking and entering.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.733
Liquor store?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.235
Oncology clinic.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.936
ALEC:
Well, either way,

17:49.969 --> 17:51.704
-I'm impressed.
-Mm. I'm sure you've fought

17:51.738 --> 17:53.673
some incredible battles
practicing medicine

17:53.706 --> 17:56.243
-all over the world.
-Uh, here and there.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.010
But I never stayed
in one place long enough

17:58.044 --> 17:59.679
to stir up Nic Nevin's
kind of trouble.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.249
What about now?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.083
Is the clinic just a pit stop

18:04.117 --> 18:05.852
or you planning on
sticking around for a while?

18:05.885 --> 18:08.255
We'll see where
tomorrow takes me.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.757
Today I'm just trying
to find patient zero.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.593
-(door buzzes)
-(indistinct chatter)

18:13.626 --> 18:15.628
(coughing)

18:25.505 --> 18:26.739
This could take a while.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.275
(woman sneezes)

18:32.312 --> 18:35.248
(indistinct chatter)

18:35.282 --> 18:37.083
Conrad got Meg's test results.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.418
It's not a thyroid storm.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.852
As predicted.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.954
Now we try to find an atypical
infection in the crowd.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.223
Mm-hmm.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.493
-Hello, ladies, up here. Hi.
-(whooping, whistles)

18:46.526 --> 18:48.027
Uh, this is Nurse Nevin.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.562
-I'm Dr. Shaw.
-(catcalling, whistling)

18:49.596 --> 18:53.300
ALEC:
Uh, it's a life-or-death
situation today,

18:53.333 --> 18:54.734
so I really need
your cooperation.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.936
If you check the following three
boxes, please raise your hand.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.871
We want triple threats only.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.209
Rash-- anywhere
from the ankles up.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.943
Swelling in the pits,
neck, or groin.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.246
Sky-high fever.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.385
WOMAN:
Me, over here.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.853
NIC:
Betsy, faking it

19:13.886 --> 19:15.488
to the infirmary--
not gonna happen today,

19:15.522 --> 19:18.157
unless you're actually sick.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.060
-She was my cellmate.
-Wow.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.129
-(Nic sighs)
-The unhealthy trinity.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.864
They've gotten something
from Meg,

19:24.897 --> 19:27.800
given it to Meg,
or none of the above.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.270
Well, we've isolated one.
Now we interrogate three.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.044
The rash started around the time
I got cleanup duty.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.612
When was that?

19:39.646 --> 19:42.215
-Few months ago.
-Is it just on your arms?

19:42.249 --> 19:45.051
-Yeah.
-BOTH: Latex allergy.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.824
Mild fever.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.833
Have you had this
your whole life?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.803
-Maybe.
-It's a birthmark.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.444
NIC:
Okay.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.880
-Flu shot?
-Don't offer 'em.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.716
-Any direct contact with Meg?
-Just about every day.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.721
These marks on your hand--
can I see them?

20:21.754 --> 20:24.056
Yeah, but it ain't a rash.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.828
Are those bites?

20:29.862 --> 20:32.164
I feed a family of pigeons
on the yard.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.467
One of them's
got a bad attitude.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.702
Did Meg feed them, too?

20:41.308 --> 20:42.842
(coughing)

20:46.212 --> 20:48.147
So I feed a few pigeons

20:48.180 --> 20:51.818
and now I'm gonna die
of what-- bird flu?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.653
You may not have the flu at all.
We think it might be

20:53.686 --> 20:55.154
cryptococcosis.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.425
(chuckles)
It's a fungal infection

20:58.458 --> 21:00.259
you can get
from pigeon droppings.

21:00.293 --> 21:03.229
(coughing)

21:03.262 --> 21:05.565
Listen, Handsome Head,

21:05.598 --> 21:08.100
I been shivved twice,

21:08.134 --> 21:09.502
several concussions,

21:09.536 --> 21:11.738
mononucleosis, shingles.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.940
I-If it's bad, tell me.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.043
I want to know exactly
what's making you sick

21:17.076 --> 21:18.478
before I answer that.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.951
(coughing continues)

21:24.984 --> 21:27.354
Do you want to call someone--
friends, family?

21:27.387 --> 21:29.922
Just...

21:29.956 --> 21:32.592
tell them where you are?

21:34.093 --> 21:36.062
I'd like to call
my ex-girlfriend,

21:36.095 --> 21:38.431
but I really blew that one.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.038
Looks like I'm not so good

21:46.072 --> 21:47.807
at this relationship thing.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.942
Not so sure I am either.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.746
(coughs)
You better tighten it up.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.116
Nic's a catch.
She's a gem.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.420
Don't let that one go.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.455
CONRAD:
Doing my best.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.958
You hang tight.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.994
Be back to do the scope
on your lungs.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.331
(indistinct conversations)

22:12.365 --> 22:14.601
I got the answers you want.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.603
-You ready for this?
-Just spit it out.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.105
The last hospital
QuoVadis was involved with

22:19.138 --> 22:20.940
was Jacksonville General.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.942
Gordon worked with them
extensively...

22:22.975 --> 22:24.444
Define "extensively".

22:24.477 --> 22:26.446
It was the hospital
where he ran trials

22:26.479 --> 22:27.714
for another device
of some kind.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.348
Which device?

22:30.717 --> 22:32.519
Who was the CEO?

22:32.552 --> 22:34.854
-Uh, okay, you lost me.
-Oh, for crying out loud.

22:34.887 --> 22:38.124
-I'll do it myself.
-(pager buzzes)

22:38.157 --> 22:40.593
The charge nurse needs me
to speak to a patient,

22:40.627 --> 22:43.162
so you get one more chance
to get this right.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.699
I need to talk to the CEO
Gordon did business with.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.135
It's not just about the where,
it's also about the whom.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.670
-Totally makes sense.
-Do...

22:50.703 --> 22:52.505
-Really?
-Yeah, I get it.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.973
-I will-I will do that.
-Okay.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.543
Okay.
Good talk.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.682
Hey.
You paged?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.150
I did.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.351
I saw something
that made me nervous.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.920
I want to see if
it makes you nervous.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.858
(quietly):
In here.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.727
DEVON:
Hey, Sam.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.763
Mm, Dr. Pravesh, you're back.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.397
-Good to see you, man.
-How we feeling, Sam?

23:18.431 --> 23:20.433
Well, pretty lousy, actually.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.704
When'd you get that rash?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.473
Uh, I don't know.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.514
Definitely nervous.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.783
We need help
with a patient move.

23:36.816 --> 23:40.019
Hundley, we need to
limit exposure to other patients

23:40.052 --> 23:41.954
-and all hospital staff.
-Masks. I'm on it.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.089
IRVING:
Angelique.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.261
Masks, people.
Keep it moving, folks.

23:49.295 --> 23:52.765
-Here you go, sweetheart.
Put that on.
-Why do we need masks?

23:52.799 --> 23:55.935
-Does he have Ebola?
-It's just procedure.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.008
(indistinct chatter)

24:02.041 --> 24:04.410
Hundley, get a mask on.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.317
Mask, please.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.888
Sam, I'm gonna put this mask
on you, okay?

24:15.922 --> 24:17.223
Ready?

24:17.256 --> 24:19.391
-Yep.
-Let's go.

24:19.425 --> 24:22.428
What's going on? Where...
where are you moving me?

24:22.461 --> 24:23.963
Isolation.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.335
So I thought you said
you had this under control.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.470
Now there are two more patients
with worsening symptoms.

24:31.504 --> 24:34.507
Spiking fevers, hemorrhaging.
And people are afraid

24:34.541 --> 24:37.276
-they're caught in an outbreak.
-Nobody thinks that.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.579
Trending hashtag--
"the outbreak hospital"--

24:39.612 --> 24:40.980
says otherwise.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.649
This is not an outbreak.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.084
I did a bronchoscopy
to check for cryptococcus.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.119
We have confirmed
it is not fungal.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.955
So you know what it's not,
but you still have

24:48.988 --> 24:51.490
no idea what it is.
Marburg, Lassa.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.492
All viral hemorrhagic fevers
are still on the table.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.762
ALEC:
That's why we have
PAPR suits just in case.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.097
And we've already
contacted the CDC.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.332
Whatever it is, we are
prepared to handle it.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.935
Emory will handle it. The only
thing you need to prepare

25:02.969 --> 25:05.605
-is your transfer summary.
-CONRAD: Hold on.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.974
-You are not transferring
these patients.
-I am.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.942
Because a two-patient problem
risks being

25:09.976 --> 25:11.477
a Chastain nightmare.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.845
If these infections
keep getting worse,

25:12.879 --> 25:15.281
a helicopter ride
could be a death sentence.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.717
Emory is a top-tier
infectious disease hospital.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.318
The federal government literally

25:19.351 --> 25:22.188
pays them to take charge
of this scenario.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.422
Emory is tasked with
taking care of patients

25:23.455 --> 25:25.357
other hospitals
are incapable of managing.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.659
But we are
all over this thing.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.394
I beg to differ.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.529
Gonna take me a couple hours
to arrange the chopper

25:30.563 --> 25:32.431
and the transfers.
That's how long you have.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.366
If you can diagnose and treat
before it lands,

25:34.400 --> 25:36.869
then... great.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.905
Job well done.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.881
If you see blood,
it's your own.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.517
The room is cold,
the scalpel is sharp.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.853
I can assure you
and your weak stomach

25:53.886 --> 25:55.888
he will not bleed.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.860
I'm sorry.
He, uh, s-still looks...

26:00.893 --> 26:02.895
Looks alive.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.396
He's not.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.766
The first time
you step into the OR

26:06.799 --> 26:08.500
your patient will look dead,

26:08.534 --> 26:10.202
but he won't be.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.471
It's a tricky thing
to wrap your head around.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.641
In the OR

26:14.674 --> 26:17.043
you must only
follow your instinct.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.946
Everything else,
you check at the door.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.547
Watch.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.582
(monitor beeping)

26:27.353 --> 26:29.188
This damn valve is too big.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.058
MINA:
No, I think you're
holding it upside down.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.326
Which is, I believe, what Julian

26:34.360 --> 26:36.963
was trying to tell you.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.438
Uh, what's in the box?

26:46.472 --> 26:48.474
Seven QuoVadis heart valves.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.678
And why are they here?

26:51.711 --> 26:53.913
I want you to put them
through the pulse duplicator.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.581
And why are you here?

26:55.614 --> 26:58.217
I'm helping someone get back
to where they belong

26:58.250 --> 27:01.721
and you have reached the ceiling
on your consecutive questions,

27:01.754 --> 27:03.255
so run the tests.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.938
Okay, pump it harder.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.339
And this time,

27:20.372 --> 27:22.541
mimic the flow of blood
of an agile patient.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.051
A-A little more.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.652
(machine whirring faster)

27:47.734 --> 27:50.837
We are gonna be
in so much trouble.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.439
The valves aren't strong enough
for a younger,

27:53.472 --> 27:55.541
active patient.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.144
Like Bradley.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.749
(gasping, coughing)

28:02.782 --> 28:06.152
(monitor beeping rapidly)

28:06.185 --> 28:09.155
He can't breathe.
What should I do?

28:09.188 --> 28:11.190
I'll be right in.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.493
What's going on?

28:14.526 --> 28:16.528
CONRAD:
Sam's oxygen sats are dropping.

28:16.562 --> 28:18.564
-I'm on it.
-(gasping continues)

28:22.034 --> 28:23.870
Meg, don't get out of bed.

28:26.739 --> 28:27.907
Hey, good to go.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.546
(air hissing)

28:34.580 --> 28:37.850
He's not protecting his airway.
I need to intubate.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.252
(groaning)

28:40.286 --> 28:42.254
She's seizing!

28:42.288 --> 28:44.290
Meg, hold on.

28:44.323 --> 28:47.026
(Meg grunting)

28:49.628 --> 28:52.064
I can't get an airway.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.237
She's gonna aspirate.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.172
(coughing)

29:05.945 --> 29:07.947
Nic, what are you doing?
It's not safe without the suit.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.216
There's no time for a suit.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.221
-(Meg grunting)
-(air hissing)

29:16.455 --> 29:18.457
(liquid slurping)

29:25.731 --> 29:27.733
(grunting stops)

29:27.766 --> 29:30.402
(monitor beeping steadily)

29:30.436 --> 29:32.138
(grunts softly)

29:44.750 --> 29:47.553
She was gonna aspirate
into her lungs and die.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.256
You would have done
the same thing.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.892
-I told you I had it.
-I heard what you said.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.393
I made the call.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.597
Let's just get back to work.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.736
Nic...

30:06.772 --> 30:08.140
...you've been exposed.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.143
I know.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.813
I'll stay in isolation.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.823
ALEC:
Masks on. Doors closed.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.492
Nothing to see but definitely
something to catch

30:26.525 --> 30:28.961
if you don't cover your faces
and clear the way.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.798
CONRAD:
Milosh. Golden Girls is on now.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.100
Golden Girls?

30:34.133 --> 30:36.668
Yeah. Get back in your room.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.805
ALEC:
Nice assist.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.009
Nice block.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.523
No brain bleed.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.959
So her seizure was caused
by the infection.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.895
Lymph nodes are filled
with fluid.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.797
Immunoglobulins just came back.

31:05.831 --> 31:08.200
Abnormally low.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.568
Compromised immune system
explains

31:09.601 --> 31:12.704
the rapid progression
of the symptoms.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.007
Not much time
before we lose her.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.943
I'll identify the infection
once I get a fluid sample

31:16.976 --> 31:18.144
from a needle aspiration.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.712
Two needle aspirations: Meg

31:20.746 --> 31:22.748
and Sam.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.686
(monitor beeping steadily)

31:28.921 --> 31:30.722
NIC:
Feel fine.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.392
Keeping the suit on
just in case I'm not infected.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.860
Was my concern that obvious?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.095
Hopefully we have
a diagnosis soon.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.829
We can get you both out of here.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.365
Well, apart from the potential

31:39.398 --> 31:41.934
of having
a life-threatening infection,

31:41.968 --> 31:45.537
living in isolation
hasn't been so bad.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.473
Conrad, things got crazy
around here today,

31:47.506 --> 31:49.241
otherwise I would have
found you to talk to.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.710
Eh, don't worry.
House is off the table.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.446
-I let it go.
-You did what?

31:54.480 --> 31:57.249
Eh, it just didn't feel right.

31:57.283 --> 32:00.086
But we can keep looking.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.287
(phone vibrating)

32:01.320 --> 32:03.689
If you even want to.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.295
Alec needs that sample ASAP,

32:09.328 --> 32:11.763
so we better
get that transfer ready.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.011
Where are my disciples?

32:25.044 --> 32:28.514
Sharing a six-foot sub,
paid for by me.

32:28.547 --> 32:32.118
You bought them a man sandwich?

32:32.151 --> 32:34.020
Yes.

32:34.053 --> 32:37.289
All to get you alone
so I could admit to your face

32:37.323 --> 32:39.625
that you are a god.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.496
I'm listening eagerly,
but I'm very hungry.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.332
Did you order me anything?

32:46.365 --> 32:48.400
Oh, God. You are arrogant and
your ego could fill this room,

32:48.434 --> 32:52.404
but you're gonna shut
your ass up and listen, August.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.676
I ran seven QuoVadis valves
through a pulse simulator.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.312
I think I proved that
Bradley's death was caused

33:00.346 --> 33:01.713
by a device error,

33:01.747 --> 33:04.150
not an operator error.

33:06.252 --> 33:09.288
Desperation is not
a good look on you, Mina.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.323
Manipulation is even worse.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.325
Are you calling me a liar?

33:13.359 --> 33:15.894
I'm saying when I was
a young, spongey pup,

33:15.927 --> 33:19.798
I would have done anything to
get my mentor Abe Benedict back

33:19.831 --> 33:22.268
-if he were circling
down the drain.
-Oh, that's not what I'm doing.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.504
The same Abe Benedict
who vouched for QuoVadis valves.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.774
Who showed me that my ego
was what most likely

33:28.807 --> 33:30.409
caused Bradley his death.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.644
So, no, Mina, it's not
that I don't trust you.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.846
I just trust him
a hell of a lot more.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.982
Well, he's wrong,
and you're stubborn.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.518
If the point
of this whole penance

33:39.551 --> 33:41.687
is to get yourself to listen,

33:41.720 --> 33:43.989
then I suggest
you start listening.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.194
Bradley...

33:48.227 --> 33:50.229
was not your fault.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.773
CONRAD:
Yersinia pestis.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.976
Black Death itself.

34:05.010 --> 34:07.346
It's not just any plague.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.181
Multi-drug resistant.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.683
It's the most unusual
presentation I've ever heard of.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.818
ALEC:
And this strain is resistant

34:12.851 --> 34:14.553
to every antibiotic
but colistin.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.955
We need to get the patients
the right treatment immediately.

34:18.457 --> 34:20.626
We need to get Nic
on prophylaxis.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.494
Stat.

34:22.528 --> 34:26.898
And Sam's bacterial load
is much higher than Meg's.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.667
He's had this for longer.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.669
So Sam infected Meg.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.071
We need to find out
where Sam's been.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.540
Whoever got him infected
is out there

34:34.573 --> 34:36.808
spreading it all over Atlanta.

34:36.842 --> 34:40.212
Sam's intubated,
but I know who can help us.

34:40.246 --> 34:43.149
Black Plague.

34:43.182 --> 34:46.118
That's quite a zebra.
Ever seen it?

34:46.152 --> 34:47.753
Ten cases a year
in the United States,

34:47.786 --> 34:49.355
mostly on the West Coast.

34:49.388 --> 34:52.358
Sam brought it here,
but someone gave it to him.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.792
What did he tell you in the ER?

34:53.825 --> 34:55.227
You mean what didn't he tell me.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.695
Okay, replay it all.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.397
We need to know where he went,
who he saw.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.399
Okay.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.901
He picked flowers
in Piedmont Park.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.971
Um, he basically spent
the entire day primping

35:06.004 --> 35:09.175
for a first date
with his future wife, Sue.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.677
Wait.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.145
She hikes.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.447
-She just hiked.
-Hiked where?

35:15.481 --> 35:17.383
Yosemite.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.386
Yosemite is a hotbed
for plague carried by fleas.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.321
She could be our patient zero.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.723
What did dispatch say?

35:24.756 --> 35:27.058
Busted down Sue's front door.
Found her minimally responsive,

35:27.092 --> 35:28.260
thready pulse.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.461
(air hisses)

35:29.495 --> 35:31.463
(siren wailing in distance)

35:33.432 --> 35:35.434
(siren approaching)

35:45.644 --> 35:48.280
ALEC:
Get her isolated. Let's go.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.053
DEVON:
Okay, ready?

35:56.288 --> 35:58.657
One, two, three.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.832
-Buboes.
-We need more access.
-ALEC: Septic shock.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.801
All right, I'll put in the
central line. Give me the kit.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.803
IRVING:
Fluids and antibiotics.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.872
Remember, this is
a multi-drug resistant strain.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.140
Already talked to the pharmacy.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.175
Colistin being mixed
as we speak.

36:17.209 --> 36:20.212
Let's just hope
we're not too late.

36:26.318 --> 36:29.120
(grunts)

36:29.154 --> 36:31.790
Is Sue okay?
Tell me she's okay.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.992
It was close,
but she's gonna make it.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.161
-You all are.
-(sighs) Yes.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.267
Dr. Pravesh, awesome work
from you and...

36:41.300 --> 36:44.670
the doctors and everyone. Wow.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.305
Sue gave me the plague.

36:46.338 --> 36:50.141
And I know-I know
it's nuts, but... (laughs)

36:50.175 --> 36:51.710
I find it kind of romantic.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.545
MULLINS:
Imagine what happens to this kid

36:53.579 --> 36:56.114
had Sue bought the farm?

36:56.147 --> 37:00.018
Make fun all you want, Meg.
I'm fine with it. You know why?

37:00.051 --> 37:02.187
And maybe it's corny.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.491
It was love at first sight
with me and Sue.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.526
(laughs softly)

37:10.095 --> 37:12.731
Please tell me you didn't
steal those two ultrasounds.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.401
Didn't have to. A little
bartering with Master Bell.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.837
I scratched him,
he scratched me. Everyone wins.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.673
-Mostly the patients.
-Well, yeah.

37:21.707 --> 37:25.176
They are all that matters,
so whatever it takes.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.016
Hey, Nic, is everything okay?

37:31.049 --> 37:33.285
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm good.
I just...

37:33.319 --> 37:36.688
I wanted to come and say
thank you for your help today.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.690
I learned a few things.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.527
Yeah, me, too.
Now you deserve some rest.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.995
Why don't you go home and have
a couple cold ones with Conrad?

37:44.029 --> 37:46.031
Enjoy yourself.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.099
Yeah.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.035
Yeah, I need to do that.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.070
Have a good night, Alec.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.842
What are we doing here?

37:56.875 --> 37:59.110
Ah, well, there's our table.

37:59.144 --> 38:01.380
People are at that table.

38:01.413 --> 38:04.750
Dr. Benedict.
My man and mentor.

38:04.783 --> 38:08.420
This is Dr. Mina Okafor,
the yin to my yang.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.356
BENEDICT:
Oh, nice to meet you. You both

38:10.389 --> 38:13.024
-just happen to be here?
-Or we knew you'd
happen to be here.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.594
-(Benedict laughs)
-It's Tuesday night foie gras,
baby, all right?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.396
Oh, what can I do for you,
then, Dr. Austin?

38:17.429 --> 38:19.665
AUSTIN:
Well, actually, Doc,
you've done enough.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.033
You've been a great mentor
these last six years.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.135
Oh, you sound like somebody
who's gonna quit.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.938
Does it? (chuckles):
Oh, no. On the contrary.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.908
Yeah, I'm here because
I wanted you to explain to me

38:29.941 --> 38:33.379
and my partner exactly
why you vouch for QuoVadis.

38:39.585 --> 38:42.354
I told you,
the penicillin on the...

38:42.388 --> 38:44.155
Dollars for Docs.

38:44.189 --> 38:45.957
Ever heard of that?
Probably not.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.394
It's a ProPublica site
on the interwebs

38:48.427 --> 38:50.996
that releases details
on corporate payouts.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.632
So, we're here, specifically,

38:53.665 --> 38:56.602
to find out more
about that 1.5-mil ticket

38:56.635 --> 38:59.805
that Mr. Gordon Page deposited
into your bank account.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.309
Honey, will you
give us a minute?

39:08.447 --> 39:11.249
I'd prefer to have this
conversation in my office...

39:11.282 --> 39:14.085
I'm not going anywhere.

39:14.119 --> 39:17.155
See, when Dr. Okafor
believes in something--

39:17.188 --> 39:19.425
or in this case, someone--

39:19.458 --> 39:22.461
she will swim through
a lake of fire and brimstone

39:22.494 --> 39:24.295
to reach her objective.

39:24.329 --> 39:26.798
Whereas you...

39:26.832 --> 39:29.000
you led me to believe

39:29.034 --> 39:32.003
that my arrogance
killed my patient.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.540
When, in fact, it was a company

39:34.573 --> 39:38.343
that makes defective valves
and owns you.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.546
(sighs)

39:40.579 --> 39:42.514
Disappointing.

39:47.352 --> 39:50.722
Anything you'd like to add?

39:50.756 --> 39:52.758
Not at the moment.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.434
See you around, Abe.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.819
(knock on door)

40:20.852 --> 40:23.421
You want the good,
the bad or the ugly?

40:23.455 --> 40:25.557
In that order.

40:25.591 --> 40:28.326
Good: I found the CEO
and head of neurosurgery

40:28.359 --> 40:31.229
at Jacksonville General,
Dr. Ryan Kehoe.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.732
Also went to Cabo
with Gordon Page.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.100
Uh, pioneered
his new back device,

40:35.133 --> 40:36.735
opinion leader for QuoVadis.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.705
Sounding familiar?

40:39.738 --> 40:41.707
Bad: that scotch is from my mom.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.009
She and my dad crossed paths
at my Aunt Denise's wedding,

40:44.042 --> 40:47.613
and the DJ's choice of mid-'70s
soft rock reignited their spark

40:47.646 --> 40:50.616
in a sloppy way
that makes me cringe.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.651
-But they had...
-What's the ugly?

40:54.753 --> 40:57.989
You can't meet with Dr. Kehoe
because he's dead.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.794
Ten months ago, at the height of
his partnership with QuoVadis,

41:02.828 --> 41:05.664
he jumped off
the Dames Point Bridge.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.613
-(sighs) Look, you didn't...
-Are you...?

41:31.189 --> 41:33.491
Look, Conrad,
I like what we have.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.393
Where we are.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.829
I don't want things to change.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.264
Not right now, anyway.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.399
I just... I spend
so much of my time

41:41.432 --> 41:43.468
trying to figure it out
what to tell patients,

41:43.501 --> 41:46.705
trying to alleviate their fears
before and after the diagnosis,

41:46.738 --> 41:49.340
to protect them, but sometimes

41:49.374 --> 41:52.277
a hard truth is just
the best thing for everyone.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.512
So...

41:54.546 --> 41:56.548
how about you and I
stop dancing around the issue

41:56.582 --> 41:59.117
and we just get real honest
with each other?

41:59.150 --> 42:00.852
What do you want me to say?

42:00.886 --> 42:04.623
Well, that we find ourselves
in different places? Once again.

42:04.656 --> 42:07.759
(sighs) Yes, but that doesn't
mean that I don't want

42:07.793 --> 42:11.462
to move in with you
or get married, all of it,

42:11.496 --> 42:13.164
just not this second.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.534
-Isn't that okay?
-And I respect that.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.536
If it's the truth.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.773
(chuckles)

42:23.809 --> 42:26.945
Okay, Conrad, you seem to have
all the answers to what's wrong,

42:26.978 --> 42:29.114
and probably a way to fix it.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.650
Go ahead.

42:31.683 --> 42:35.186
It's already fixed.

42:35.220 --> 42:38.223
Look at me.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.391
Willing to sit down, talk things
through. That's progress, right?

42:40.425 --> 42:41.860
And that's thanks to you.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.763
But that's the problem
right there.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.898
There's nothing left
for you to fix.

42:46.932 --> 42:49.668
-That's not fair.
-Well...

42:49.701 --> 42:51.837
it's not about being fair.

42:51.870 --> 42:54.439
Nic, it's about being honest.

42:54.472 --> 42:56.541
I was a project for you,
and now it's finished.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.209
That's my fear.
That's my diagnosis.

42:58.243 --> 43:01.713
-(chuckles)
-Is it true?

43:01.747 --> 43:03.615
All right, I shouldn't have
come here today.

43:03.649 --> 43:05.183
Well, tell me I'm wrong,
tell me I'm right.

43:05.216 --> 43:07.819
Either way, just open up
like you asked me to do.

43:07.853 --> 43:11.890
And I will, when I'm ready,
when I figure some things out.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.725
(sighs)

43:13.759 --> 43:16.594
Would it help if I went back
to the old version of me?

43:16.628 --> 43:17.829
(scoffs quietly)

43:19.097 --> 43:21.700
I'm not sure I like
either version of you right now.

43:21.733 --> 43:24.335
At least now
you're being honest.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.708
(sighs)
Good night, Conrad.

44:11.082 --> 44:13.018
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.186 --> 44:16.955
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.524
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.227 --> 44:24.029
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:25.263 --> 44:27.198
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:29.034 --> 44:31.937
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:31.970 --> 44:33.304
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.539
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:34.572 --> 44:39.010
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:39.044 --> 44:42.613
* Make this right here
Right now *

44:42.647 --> 44:46.417

44:46.451 --> 44:49.187
