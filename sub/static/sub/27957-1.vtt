Happy birthday.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.238
Ah, thank you, thank you.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.307
- To the band.
- To the band.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.875
- To Ronnie's birthday.
- Ronnie.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.244
- To Ronnie.
- To Ronnie.

01:52.246 --> 01:55.547
Do you always celebrate
the night before?

01:55.549 --> 01:57.883
I was born at 3 a.m.
If I wait till tomorrow,

01:57.885 --> 02:00.185
by the time I wake up,
it'll have been over.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.155
So keep drinking
till 3:00 then?

02:03.157 --> 02:06.225
Can't. Things to do.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.406
I love you.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.475
I love you.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.671
What are you taking?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.540
Just a sleeping pill.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.376
Had a few rough nights lately.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.478
Why didn't you tell me?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.612
It doesn't matter.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.883
Hey.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.392
What's going on?

03:13.394 --> 03:17.930
We won't see each other
when I go on tour.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.699
Babe, you're a rock chick.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.335
This is what you do.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.837
I can't follow you
around the world, can I?

03:25.839 --> 03:30.375
And you're happy
just to keep going like this?

03:32.279 --> 03:33.712
What?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.347
Forget it.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.717
I'm screwing up your birthday.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.788
No. I wanna know
what you're talking about.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.390
You never stop.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.227
When you're working on your art,
it takes you over.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.000
Like some kind of beast.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.270
What, so this is
about me now?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.938
No.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.841
I'm the same.
Exactly the same.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.410
But sometimes,
it just gets to me,

04:05.412 --> 04:08.480
that we never have time
to be together.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.796
Ronnie, your scar is bleeding.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.035
Wow. You really
did a number on me.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.871
- Has it ever done that before?
- No.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.741
I'd better get a plaster.
Be back.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.839
Happy birthday, darling.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.144
Thank you, Mum.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.447
How was Lena's gig?

06:55.449 --> 06:57.983
Great. I'm still feeling it.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.585
I saw her video on YouTube
in the store.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.687
Yeah? What did you think?

07:02.689 --> 07:04.423
Amazing.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.425
So when do I get
to see you guys?

07:06.427 --> 07:07.759
We can do tonight
if you like.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.794
Perfect.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.629
I made you a cake.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.631
Ooh, then we're
definitely coming.

07:14.735 --> 07:18.036
Something happened to me
last night.

07:18.038 --> 07:22.474
This whole huge painting
just came to me out of nowhere.

07:22.476 --> 07:27.446
It only hit me afterwards
that I started at 3 a.m.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.581
Exactly my birthday, right?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.550
Mm. Can I see it?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.018
Yeah, sure.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.092
Sorry. Do you have
an IT section?

07:41.094 --> 07:44.663
Yes, sure, follow me.
I'll be back, Mum.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.940
You sure she said tonight?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.110
Lights are on.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.184
Mum?

08:41.255 --> 08:43.154
Mum, it's me and Lena.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.269
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I hope so too.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.707
Can't register
as missing yet.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.809
She has to be gone
for 48 hours.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.711
<i>Hi, this is Suleka.</i>

09:06.713 --> 09:09.080
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

09:27.868 --> 09:30.001
Mum?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.703
<i>Is that Ronnie?</i>

09:31.705 --> 09:33.838
Yeah.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.840
<i>You're Suleka's son, right?</i>

09:35.842 --> 09:37.642
Yes. Who is this?

09:37.644 --> 09:41.279
<i>I'm AJ, your cousin.
Your Uncle Mohan's son.</i>

09:41.281 --> 09:43.181
<i>I'm calling from Kolkata.</i>

09:43.183 --> 09:45.050
<i>Ronnie, your mother's
in hospital.</i>

09:45.052 --> 09:46.952
<i>She was hit by a car.</i>

09:48.288 --> 09:50.855
What? In Kolkata?

09:50.857 --> 09:52.624
<i>Well, we don't
understand either.</i>

09:52.626 --> 09:53.992
<i>We didn't even know
she was in India</i>

09:53.994 --> 09:55.193
<i>until the hospital phoned.</i>

09:55.195 --> 09:56.928
Is she gonna be okay?

09:56.930 --> 10:00.098
<i>Well, Ronnie,
she's been kept in a coma.</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:03.168
<i>She has a blood clot
on her lung.</i>

10:03.170 --> 10:06.338
Uh, okay, okay, um...

10:06.340 --> 10:09.040
Look, I'm gonna search
for flights right now, okay?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.642
<i>Tell me when
you're getting in,</i>

10:10.644 --> 10:11.910
<i>and I'll be there
to get you.</i>

10:11.912 --> 10:13.311
Okay. Thank you.

10:21.355 --> 10:25.223
Mum said she never wanted
to go back to India.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.258
She said she never wanted
to see those people again.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.403
Ronnie!

10:38.405 --> 10:40.338
Are you AJ?

10:40.340 --> 10:43.808
I recognized you from the photo
on your Mum's phone.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.210
This way.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.914
First time here?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.057
Is my mother conscious yet?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.892
Mm-mm.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.250
No, no, no, no!
They'll all come for you.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.021
Unintelligent behavior.

11:50.777 --> 11:54.045
I managed to transfer your mum
to their special ward.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.125
Hi, Mum.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.294
It's me, Ronnie.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.036
Yes, sir.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.042
Shit. Are you the son
from England?

12:24.044 --> 12:25.810
That's right. Ronnie.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.445
Dr. Multlar.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.348
Look, Ronnie, I've got some
really good news for you.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.217
Early this morning,

12:32.219 --> 12:34.919
we managed to break down
your mother's blood clot.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.755
So that means...

12:36.757 --> 12:38.323
That means we'll have
to keep her in this state

12:38.325 --> 12:39.991
for another couple of days,

12:39.993 --> 12:43.928
and then we have hope
that she'll recover.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.334
Look, this is the time
when she needs to bathe her,

12:49.336 --> 12:53.138
and we also need
to run some tests, so...

12:54.374 --> 12:56.407
Doctor...

13:16.496 --> 13:19.197
So there's Latta, AJ's wife,

13:19.199 --> 13:21.499
and their kid Juma.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.534
Juma's really sweet, actually.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.803
<i>Really? How old is she?</i>

13:24.805 --> 13:26.805
I think 5 or 6.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.307
And AJ's dad lives here.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.209
Mohan.
Mum's older brother.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.077
<i>Is he the one who treated
your mum so badly?</i>

13:33.079 --> 13:35.413
Yeah. He's barely
said hello so far.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.084
I think dinner's ready.
I'll call you later.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.220
<i>I'm so glad to hear
your mum's doing better.</i>

13:42.222 --> 13:43.922
<i>Please send her my love.</i>

14:24.531 --> 14:26.197
It's a conch, you know?

14:26.199 --> 14:29.901
We blow it to ward off
evil spirits.

14:29.903 --> 14:33.304
Why your mother
doesn't do puja?

14:33.306 --> 14:36.174
She doesn't really keep up
with those traditions.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.510
So when she's better,

14:39.512 --> 14:42.080
you think you will be exploring
Kolkata with her?

14:42.082 --> 14:46.184
I expect she'll want to
get back to London in a hurry.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.955
Depends if she's up to it.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.891
- This is delicious.
- Thank you.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.494
This is ilish macher bhapa.
Did you have it before?

14:56.496 --> 14:59.931
No. I don't think I've ever
seen it on a restaurant menu.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.499
We mostly cook it at home.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.001
I don't think Ronnie's mother

15:03.003 --> 15:05.036
will cook something
like this at home.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.038
Why are you so sure of that?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.441
'Cause you said
she isn't interested

15:10.443 --> 15:11.676
in Bengali traditions.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.245
Oh.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.247
Well, whose fault is that?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.284
Uncle Mohan?

15:22.923 --> 15:25.056
What do you mean?

15:25.058 --> 15:27.492
What do you think I mean?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.527
Making these digs
at my mother,

15:29.529 --> 15:32.330
like she should be sorry
for leaving India.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.466
She didn't abandon you.
You abandoned her.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.669
What are you talking about?

15:37.671 --> 15:39.938
Please excuse us.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.539
Come.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.449
My mum married for love

15:51.451 --> 15:55.420
and apparently the man she loved
was the wrong caste.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.990
So your dad here
cut her dead.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.059
Even when my father died,

16:01.061 --> 16:03.461
and my mum was left
pregnant and alone,

16:03.463 --> 16:06.597
your dad shut the door
in her face.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.434
That's why she ran
to London to have me.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.080
Ronnie, who told you that?

16:22.082 --> 16:24.983
My mum.
Who do you think?

16:31.358 --> 16:32.557
What's this?

16:34.327 --> 16:40.131
This was taken on
your parents' wedding day.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.233
That's my dad there.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.472
And this one is you...

16:47.474 --> 16:50.541
in your parents'
Kolkata house.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.590
- Did you tell him I'm sorry?
- Yeah.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.594
But this is what he's like
when he's upset.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.329
He shuts everyone out.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.233
Hey, Ronnie,

17:15.234 --> 17:16.768
you smoke ganja?

17:18.070 --> 17:19.069
I can't understand why my mum

17:19.071 --> 17:21.672
made up all these lies.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.142
Maybe she lost it
after my father died.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.681
Ronnie...

17:34.120 --> 17:37.221
Your dad was still alive
when your mum left India.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.490
What?

17:41.494 --> 17:45.263
My dad said he would come around
asking all the time

17:45.265 --> 17:47.131
if we had heard from her.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.133
But I was just a kid, man.
I don't remember much.

17:49.135 --> 17:56.207
Wait. You're saying that my mum
left my dad here?

17:56.209 --> 17:59.077
I think after about
four or five years,

17:59.079 --> 18:01.746
he just stopped looking.

18:03.616 --> 18:07.652
I guess if he died,
it would have been later.

18:10.723 --> 18:14.559
Meaning he might still
be alive?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.796
You need to talk
to your mum, man.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.403
Mum? Mum? Hey!

18:59.405 --> 19:01.439
It's me.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.608
I'm so glad you're okay.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.311
Where am I?

19:08.348 --> 19:09.714
You're in a hospital, Mum.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.750
But you're gonna be fine.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.352
You're in Kolkata.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.260
- Ronnie.
- Yeah?

19:22.262 --> 19:24.729
You need to go.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.298
We'll leave as soon as
you're better, Mum, okay?

19:27.300 --> 19:30.468
No. Go now.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.204
Why?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.207
She's coming.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.341
Who is?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.746
Ronnie?

19:41.748 --> 19:44.182
It's okay, Mum, it's okay.
It's just a power cut.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.950
No, Ronnie, you need to go!

19:45.952 --> 19:48.386
You need to leave India. Go!

19:48.388 --> 19:50.221
Mum, I'm not gonna leave
without you, okay?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.757
- Go! Go! Go!
- Mum, Mum, I'm--

19:52.759 --> 19:55.259
Excuse me, my mum's
having some kind of fit.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.561
Can you please
come and help?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.663
Excuse me, sir,
I'm busy now, please.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.400
Nurse, I'm sorry
to bother you,

20:02.402 --> 20:04.435
but my mum is having
some kind of fit.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.804
Excuse me,
that patient needs help.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.239
I'll come in a minute.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.744
Mum. Mum?

20:53.853 --> 20:55.620
Help me!

21:05.999 --> 21:08.566
One of the last things
my mother said

21:08.568 --> 21:10.568
was that "she was coming."

21:10.570 --> 21:14.772
And you think she meant
this woman in the purple sari?

21:14.774 --> 21:18.309
Well, she didn't kill
your mother.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.679
She couldn't have made it
to the ground level so fast.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.548
Probably she was some
beggar woman passing by.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.752
What about the symbol she drew
in my mother's blood?

21:27.754 --> 21:30.454
Who knows?

21:30.456 --> 21:32.390
Maybe she was just a crazy.

21:35.461 --> 21:39.063
You know, you can't really
push someone from here.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.732
You have to pick them up
and then throw them down.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.842
Thanks.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.453
Your mother was here because
she ran in front of a car.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.959
My mother would never
kill herself.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.829
I talk to her every day.
She never said anything.

22:11.831 --> 22:15.066
I'm afraid they often don't.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.567
I'm sorry.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.168
What's this?

25:05.972 --> 25:07.638
It'll protect you.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.741
From what?

25:10.743 --> 25:13.244
They say it takes 13 days

25:13.246 --> 25:15.546
for your mother's soul
to leave this place.

25:15.548 --> 25:16.914
And in that time,

25:16.916 --> 25:19.783
her soul is attracted
towards her loved ones.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.926
Who's that?

25:41.841 --> 25:46.243
Excuse me, did you know
my mother, Suleka?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.980
You are her son?

25:52.985 --> 25:54.952
I am very sorry.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.655
It was me.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.557
I did this.

25:59.559 --> 26:03.827
I hit your mother with my car.

26:03.829 --> 26:07.197
I called the hospital
to know how she was doing,

26:07.199 --> 26:09.633
but they said she was...

26:14.874 --> 26:18.609
Do you think she ran in front
of your car deliberately?

26:18.611 --> 26:23.714
It was like she was
running away from someone.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.923
Where did this happen?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.923
Are we here?

27:10.262 --> 27:11.729
Okay.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.210
Do you remember this woman?

28:08.688 --> 28:09.820
Girlfriend?

28:11.357 --> 28:13.824
Accident.
Run over last week.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.033
What the hell is this, huh?

28:23.035 --> 28:25.402
Where from, sweetie?

28:25.404 --> 28:26.970
London.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.972
Hey, hey, London!

28:33.913 --> 28:35.813
- No, sorry.
- Drink, drink!

28:35.815 --> 28:38.949
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, come, sweetie, come.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.784
Good, thank you.
Good morning.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.322
Excuse me.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.025
Have you seen this woman?

28:48.027 --> 28:50.360
She was here last--

28:57.103 --> 28:58.402
Excuse me.

29:01.741 --> 29:05.375
Sorry. Have you--
Have you seen this woman?

29:48.954 --> 29:51.455
Did you see her?

29:51.457 --> 29:53.023
Accident.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.859
Car?

29:55.861 --> 29:58.796
Hey, mister, where you from?

29:58.798 --> 30:00.898
Where are you from, mister?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.433
You England?

30:03.435 --> 30:04.568
Yes.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.403
Alistair Cook,

30:06.405 --> 30:08.872
Steven Peterson,

30:08.874 --> 30:10.374
and David Beckham.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.311
Give me English money.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.546
Uh, I don't have any.

30:15.548 --> 30:19.216
Yes, English money
in pocket, deep.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.250
Pocket, pocket.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.287
Mister!

30:25.391 --> 30:28.325
Mister! Wait, mister!

30:28.327 --> 30:30.594
Did you love your mother?

30:38.904 --> 30:40.003
Did you see her?

30:40.005 --> 30:42.272
Give me English money.

30:50.983 --> 30:55.352
I saw her three night ago.

30:55.354 --> 31:00.057
She was running away
from the spirit house.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.492
The what?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.895
Spirit house.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.471
Ah.

33:39.051 --> 33:42.219
Um, my name is Ronnie.

33:45.491 --> 33:48.625
This is my mother Suleka.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.727
She died last night.

33:52.398 --> 33:55.432
No. I'm not here for this.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.367
My mother came here
before she was run over.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.224
She was here, wasn't she?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.728
No. Now you go.

34:28.801 --> 34:30.801
My mother was hit by a car
near here.

34:30.803 --> 34:32.735
Someone was chasing--

34:38.577 --> 34:40.811
You recognize her,
don't you?

34:40.813 --> 34:43.447
Why was she here?

34:43.449 --> 34:45.614
Your mother--

35:01.767 --> 35:03.834
No! I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

35:03.836 --> 35:05.469
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

35:26.725 --> 35:28.291
What the fuck?

35:56.922 --> 35:59.322
A place like that
is bad news, man.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.423
You shouldn't be
going there.

36:00.425 --> 36:01.892
Then why was my mother there?

36:01.894 --> 36:03.460
You know this for certain, huh?

36:03.462 --> 36:07.831
They recognized the photo,
I'm sure of it.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.799
She's the last person in the
world to believe in that crap.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.602
Ronnie, why can't you just
let the police handle this?

36:12.604 --> 36:16.173
Then they'll think she was
crazy enough to kill herself.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.782
Can I have one?

36:36.228 --> 36:38.261
What's going on?

36:38.263 --> 36:40.830
Durga Puja
starts in a few days.

36:40.832 --> 36:44.401
Biggest festival in the city.
This place gets insane, man.

36:44.403 --> 36:47.637
All these streets along here,
all gonna be transformed.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.435
Wow.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.504
You really captured
Mahishasura.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.905
Hey.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.641
So who is he?

37:57.643 --> 37:58.975
He's a Rakshasa.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.343
A demon king.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.578
May I?

38:03.548 --> 38:06.883
He wanted to bring
apocalypse on Earth

38:06.885 --> 38:10.353
until Durgamma defeated him.

38:20.032 --> 38:22.732
You ever had a paan?

38:22.734 --> 38:24.067
What's a paan?

38:24.069 --> 38:26.870
"What's a paan?"

38:26.872 --> 38:28.805
I'll be right back.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.554
Hello?

41:53.211 --> 41:55.578
So you never saw
this woman leave?

41:55.580 --> 41:58.248
She just led you
to this young girl's body

41:58.250 --> 42:00.250
and then vanished?

42:00.252 --> 42:01.985
Yes.

42:01.987 --> 42:05.855
You say your cousin
was with you on the street.

42:05.857 --> 42:09.092
Did he see this woman
in the purple sari?

42:09.094 --> 42:12.762
No. He was buying...
something.

42:14.633 --> 42:17.667
She's been dead
for about three days now, sir.

42:17.669 --> 42:20.904
The killer tied her up,
then cut her throat.

42:20.906 --> 42:23.840
Okay. Take her out,
but keep her covered.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.276
There's a crowd out there.

42:26.278 --> 42:27.877
Okay.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.883
How long have you been
in Kolkata?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.318
Three days.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.088
What are you implying?

42:39.090 --> 42:43.893
Right now, the only thing that
links these two bodies is you.

42:43.895 --> 42:47.830
And the symbols, both painted
with the victims' blood.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.733
Excuse me a second.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.269
Asha.

42:56.808 --> 42:58.241
Yes, sir.

43:05.684 --> 43:07.116
So the police called,

43:07.118 --> 43:09.953
wanting to confirm
when you arrived in India.

43:09.955 --> 43:11.788
They can't accuse me
of killing that girl.

43:11.790 --> 43:13.156
I wasn't even here.

43:13.158 --> 43:15.592
You don't understand
how it works here.

43:15.594 --> 43:18.695
The police are under a lot
of pressure to make arrests,

43:18.697 --> 43:20.363
especially with
a young girl like this.

43:20.365 --> 43:22.632
Look, bhai,

43:22.634 --> 43:24.901
don't take this the wrong way,

43:24.903 --> 43:26.970
but you should
go back to England

43:26.972 --> 43:30.974
before they come
after you, yeah?

43:30.976 --> 43:33.743
If you need anything,
call me.

43:53.264 --> 43:55.732
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Ronnie.</i>

43:55.734 --> 43:58.668
<i>This is Asha,
the police photographer.</i>

43:58.670 --> 44:01.371
<i>Can you meet me at Elgin House?
At the murder scene.</i>

44:03.041 --> 44:05.842
I knew they were the same.
Last night.

44:05.844 --> 44:08.645
No. Do you know
Bengali numbers?

44:10.015 --> 44:14.250
The one next to your mom's body
was a six.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.220
That's a seven.

44:17.222 --> 44:20.323
I think the killer
is numbering them.

44:20.325 --> 44:23.826
But they're in the wrong order.
This girl was killed first.

45:04.836 --> 45:07.303
Nothing on her cousin?

45:07.305 --> 45:09.238
She said she was
murdered in 1987.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.007
That's a long time ago.

45:11.009 --> 45:14.343
If he's killed before,
police must have a file on him.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.079
Let's ask Banerji.

45:16.081 --> 45:18.081
No, I don't think we should
involve him in this

45:18.083 --> 45:21.117
until we know something more,

45:21.119 --> 45:25.088
not when... you're still
under investigation.

45:28.093 --> 45:30.760
Then why are you helping me?

45:30.762 --> 45:32.762
Because I know
you didn't kill your mum.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.366
I have another idea.

45:40.472 --> 45:42.004
Thank you.

45:51.516 --> 45:53.916
Zero, zero, one...

45:56.354 --> 45:58.254
October 1987.

46:01.326 --> 46:03.760
<i>Another ritual killing
last night,</i>

46:03.762 --> 46:05.962
<i>- student Anadi Dapur.</i>
<i>- </i> That's her cousin.

46:05.964 --> 46:08.498
<i>She is the sixth victim
in as many days.</i>

46:08.500 --> 46:12.401
<i>A series of killings the police
now say are definitely linked.</i>

46:22.981 --> 46:23.980
Wait.

46:29.354 --> 46:31.087
It's here.

46:35.460 --> 46:38.194
It's a two.

46:38.196 --> 46:40.797
They said this was
the sixth victim.

46:40.799 --> 46:42.198
Yep.

46:44.269 --> 46:45.434
Wait.

47:00.885 --> 47:03.019
The numbers are counting down.

47:05.857 --> 47:08.457
What are they counting down to?

47:10.962 --> 47:13.362
<i>The seventh night,
the seventh victim.</i>

47:13.364 --> 47:15.097
<i>But this one survived</i>

47:15.099 --> 47:18.367
<i>after a police officer
heard her cries for help.</i>

47:25.343 --> 47:28.377
He's saying he shot the attacker
in the shoulder.

47:30.448 --> 47:32.448
He escaped
through that window.

47:37.889 --> 47:40.489
So he might still be alive.

47:41.626 --> 47:44.227
It can't be the same killer.

47:44.229 --> 47:46.963
They shot him.

47:46.965 --> 47:50.533
And it was, what,
28 years ago.

47:53.872 --> 47:55.271
What?

47:57.075 --> 47:59.442
That's when my mother
left India.

48:12.223 --> 48:13.256
Mum?

48:52.430 --> 48:53.629
Hello?

49:00.238 --> 49:01.637
Juma.

49:11.015 --> 49:13.349
Daddy's dead! Daddy's dead!

49:13.351 --> 49:15.351
What did you say?
Juma, it's okay.

49:15.353 --> 49:16.986
Juma, it's all right.

49:16.988 --> 49:18.521
I just walked in.
She just started screaming.

49:18.523 --> 49:19.522
Juma?

49:23.094 --> 49:25.127
- Daddy's dead!
- You're dreaming.

49:27.198 --> 49:29.532
No, see?
He's right here.

49:37.475 --> 49:40.242
Daddy's lying there.
Daddy's dead.

49:47.118 --> 49:48.117
AJ.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.686
AJ.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.288
Is that a Bengali number?

49:53.992 --> 49:55.691
Yes, that's a three.

49:57.228 --> 49:58.227
What is it?

49:59.330 --> 50:01.297
You know the symbol...

50:01.299 --> 50:03.666
painted at the murders?

50:03.668 --> 50:06.402
This is it.

50:06.404 --> 50:08.404
How could Juma know that?

50:08.406 --> 50:10.072
Daddy!

50:10.074 --> 50:12.208
Coming, Juma.

50:14.579 --> 50:17.113
Ronnie.

50:17.115 --> 50:19.482
We need to talk.

50:19.484 --> 50:22.618
Our parents died
on the same day.

50:22.620 --> 50:25.087
Did your mother
tell you that?

50:26.257 --> 50:27.590
Father had a stroke,

50:27.592 --> 50:30.292
and my mother willed herself
to go with him.

50:30.294 --> 50:34.764
And just like that,
we were orphans.

50:34.766 --> 50:37.366
And, uh...

50:37.368 --> 50:39.568
we started attending séances.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.137
We?

50:42.173 --> 50:44.173
You mean my mother went too?

50:47.445 --> 50:49.779
She didn't want to go
at first.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.516
I talked her into it.

50:53.518 --> 50:56.052
We were still teenagers.

50:56.054 --> 50:59.321
I was scared to go alone,
so I made her come with me...

50:59.323 --> 51:01.690
to the Spirit House.

51:03.628 --> 51:06.262
The Spirit House?

51:10.668 --> 51:13.135
In Khalside?

51:13.136 --> 51:15.603
The medium in Khalside
was a woman called Rakhee.

51:17.075 --> 51:19.241
- Very powerful.
- Wait.

51:19.243 --> 51:21.777
- Why are you telling me this?
- Please listen.

51:23.448 --> 51:25.581
Just listen to me.

51:31.189 --> 51:34.690
The legend was,
as a child,

51:34.692 --> 51:39.829
Rakhee worked the bars
in Nimdala...

51:39.831 --> 51:43.132
until one day,
she was very badly burnt.

51:44.535 --> 51:46.502
From that moment,

51:46.504 --> 51:49.305
the spirits
started speaking to her

51:49.307 --> 51:51.207
once they left the bodies

51:51.209 --> 51:53.275
My mum has never believed
in any of this.

51:55.713 --> 51:58.180
After a while,

51:58.182 --> 52:03.686
I realized Rakhee
was very bad news,

52:03.688 --> 52:06.589
so I stopped going
to see her.

52:07.892 --> 52:10.326
But my mother
didn't stop going.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.867
She became addicted to it.

52:17.869 --> 52:19.702
The séances.

52:19.704 --> 52:21.837
She couldn't stop.

52:21.839 --> 52:23.906
Rakhee had a great power
over her.

52:23.908 --> 52:27.776
That's why I think Suleka
went to Khalside this week.

52:27.778 --> 52:30.713
No.

52:30.715 --> 52:33.582
It doesn't make any sense.

52:33.584 --> 52:35.584
Why would my mother
come all this way

52:35.586 --> 52:37.853
to find some crazy medium?

52:37.855 --> 52:41.524
Why now after so long?

52:42.793 --> 52:45.461
I have no idea,

52:45.463 --> 52:47.897
but I think it's a good idea
that you're going away

52:47.899 --> 52:51.367
before anything happens to us.

52:51.369 --> 52:53.702
Did you tell the police
about this Rakhee?

52:53.704 --> 52:55.638
Maybe they might wanna
speak to her.

52:55.640 --> 52:58.274
No. Your mother is gone.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.546
What did this Rakhee
look like?

53:05.550 --> 53:08.751
She always wore a purple sari.

55:34.332 --> 55:38.067
Why did mum lie to me
about everything?

55:38.069 --> 55:40.069
I don't know.

55:40.071 --> 55:42.037
My birth,

55:42.039 --> 55:44.073
why she left India,

55:44.075 --> 55:45.974
my dad.

55:45.976 --> 55:47.810
I mean, fuck knows
what's actually true about him.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.044
<i>Look, Ronnie,</i>

55:49.046 --> 55:50.946
don't worry about
any of that now.

55:50.948 --> 55:53.982
Just come back,
and we'll talk it all through.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.887
I just wish I just knew
why she came back here.

56:00.691 --> 56:01.757
No.

56:05.830 --> 56:06.862
Hold on.

56:15.373 --> 56:16.405
There you go.

56:19.877 --> 56:22.511
Sorry about that.

56:22.513 --> 56:23.645
Lena.

56:24.915 --> 56:25.914
Lena?

56:34.558 --> 56:37.926
- Can I have the passport, sir?
- Yeah. Uh, London.

56:37.928 --> 56:39.461
Thank you, sir.

56:41.031 --> 56:42.464
Thank you.

56:47.805 --> 56:49.805
Thank you, sir.

56:49.807 --> 56:51.740
Are you okay, sir?

56:51.742 --> 56:53.108
I'm fine.

56:53.110 --> 56:55.077
If you have a laptop,
take it out of your bags

56:55.079 --> 56:57.880
and put it on the tray
in front of you.

56:57.882 --> 56:59.114
All of your keys and wallets

56:59.116 --> 57:01.984
should be in the tray
in front of you.

57:14.031 --> 57:15.631
Are you okay, sir?

57:15.633 --> 57:19.701
Sorry, excuse me.

58:11.121 --> 58:13.789
Fuck.

58:31.141 --> 58:34.776
My passport was in my bag, too,
including my phone.

58:34.778 --> 58:37.212
Okay. Why don't you
come into our office,

58:37.214 --> 58:38.981
and we can take a description
of the man and then--

58:38.983 --> 58:41.683
But my flight's closing.

58:41.685 --> 58:44.086
You're not getting
onto that flight, sir.

58:46.991 --> 58:49.525
I'm sorry to ask you.

58:49.527 --> 58:51.527
My uncle doesn't want me
at the house.

58:51.529 --> 58:53.929
You wait there.
I'll be coming.

58:53.931 --> 58:55.831
<i>Thank you, Asha.</i>

58:55.833 --> 58:56.865
No problem.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:00.162
Oh.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:04.199
Your clothes are probably dry.
One second.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.368
What happened?

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.770
You passed out.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.739
I'm afraid you got sick
on your clothes,

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:13.775
so I rinsed them.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.077
Here.

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:19.948
How are you feeling now?

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:22.384
Better.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:25.120
Thank you.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:28.056
I'll let you get dressed.
Sorry.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.927
This little girl
sold me a bottle of water.

01:00:31.929 --> 01:00:34.129
It's like she had me
marked out.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.965
It's a hard country
for people like you.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.734
Anything can take you down.

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:42.938
But a man stole my bag,
passport, everything.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.408
I was puking up,
and he was there waiting.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:51.213
I sound completely paranoid,
right?

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:52.714
No.

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.318
Not completely.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.821
Did you give Detective Banerji
the newsreels?

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.391
I did.

01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:05.894
But he has a dozen
open murder cases.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.896
He's not about to take up a case
from 30 years ago.

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.231
But if it's coming from you--

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.433
Especially
if it's coming from me.

01:01:11.435 --> 01:01:16.338
Were you and Detective Banerji
ever in a relationship?

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.740
I saw a photo.

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:21.743
I'm afraid we still are.

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:23.045
He's my father.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.716
I don't usually tell people.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:30.285
I was a screw-up
when he got me the job.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.953
And where is your mum?

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:35.223
My mum's not alive.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:44.299
Ronnie, are you still
looking for answers?

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:47.002
What do you mean?

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:49.471
I found the original
police file.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:54.209
The police did have
a suspect back then.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.878
Arun Das.

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:04.386
<i>Arun Das.</i>

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.855
<i>Arun Das.</i>

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.292
Ronnie, maybe
we should leave this.

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:11.293
No.

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:15.397
He was a priest?

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:16.398
In training.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.033
After they shot him,

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:21.002
Arun Das was never seen again.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:24.439
So...

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:28.810
How old was he
when they shot him?

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:33.949
He was, uh... 28 then.

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:36.384
The worst thing
is that all the victims

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.220
were people he should have
cared about.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.155
I don't understand.

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.890
Like relatives, loved ones.

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:45.927
The last victim who ended up
brain damaged was...

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.429
Arun's mother.

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:51.867
- Does it say where he lived?
- In one of the slums.

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:55.070
- Which slum?
- Um...

01:02:55.072 --> 01:02:56.138
Khalside.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:00.108
The rumor is he used
to spend nights there

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.779
with a medium called, um...

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:05.313
Rakhee.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:13.388
This is where
your mum was knocked over?

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.997
Why do you think
she came here?

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.398
I don't know.

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.501
But it has to do
with Rakhee.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:38.146
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah, it's this way.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.388
- She sold me the water.
- What?

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:48.957
At the airport.

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.225
Ronnie!

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:52.961
Wait!

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:54.029
Wait!

01:03:58.902 --> 01:03:59.968
Wait!

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:04.940
Stop!

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:40.308
Hello?

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:43.945
Hello?

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:58.526
Ah, Ronnie, what happened?

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:00.896
Some... Someone...

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.503
This is the place.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:31.686
She's saying your mother
came in with this knife.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.488
Who was my mother looking for?

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:40.562
Rakhee.

01:06:57.748 --> 01:06:58.747
Nah.

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:27.142
Where is Rakhee now?
Is she alive?

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:33.681
<i>Arun Das.</i>

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:39.821
<i>Arun Das.</i>

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:07.549
This is where the cop said
he shot him. Bullet hole.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:09.250
Look.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.088
This really could be Arun Das.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:15.857
<i>Arun Das.</i>

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.660
<i>Arun Das.</i>

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:21.296
Hey.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.612
Hello?

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.251
Ronnie.

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:52.520
My father caught
the Elgin House killer.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.290
They're at the station.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.934
How did you know
this was there?

01:10:05.936 --> 01:10:08.436
I don't know.

01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:09.938
What does it say?

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:13.575
"Send seven souls to hell
in seven nights

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:15.343
in place of my soul,

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:18.479
so I can return forever,
Rakshasa."

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:20.682
A Rakshasa is a demon king.

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:22.850
Yes. This demon.

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.486
Kali Yuga's coming.

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:32.393
My mother knew
all about this stuff.

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:34.395
It took ahold of her.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.897
What does it mean?

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:39.234
There's a prophecy in the Vedas.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:43.271
Kali Yuga.

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.838
A time when demons
walk the Earth again.

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:47.675
Families kill each other.

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:49.844
Apocalypse.

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:54.916
If that's the ritual,
he failed.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:57.685
Arun didn't kill seven.

01:10:57.687 --> 01:11:00.622
Twenty-eight years ago.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:02.724
So who's your father arrested?

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:08.263
Please.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.541
Family of the dead girl.

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:21.709
Come in.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.686
Sit down.

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:47.535
But he's just a boy.

01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:56.010
You're not allowed in here!

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.580
I signed him in.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:03.518
Did this kid
really kill my mother?

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.019
No.

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:07.822
He just killed the girl,
Shugan Nagush.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.824
He has an alibi
for your mother's death.

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.592
It checks out.

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:15.029
But he painted the same symbol
over the girl's bed.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.567
Even if he painted it,
it's irrelevant.

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:21.836
He was in a study group
when your mother died.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.404
Twenty people saw him.

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:24.505
Then who drew it?

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:33.348
After your mother's death,
you ran down to her body, right?

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.649
This is bullshit.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.684
Papa, please.

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.054
You need to look at this file.

01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:47.095
There was a series of murders
just like this in 1987.

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:49.764
The same symbol was used.

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:53.801
You are investigating my case
with the suspect?

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:56.771
Read this file.

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:59.107
All of this is connected
to the present-day murders.

01:12:59.109 --> 01:13:01.876
Have you gone completely crazy?

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:05.747
You need to listen to us
or five more people may die.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:06.948
Enough!

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:18.926
Shugan Nagush's family
needs a car home.

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:20.395
Go. Call for one.

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.017
Your mother's valuables.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:46.020
You can collect the clothes
from the front desk.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:52.460
What does this mean?

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:54.562
Aren't you investigating it
anymore?

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:57.565
We recovered the CCTV footage
from the hospital.

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:00.501
Nobody went in
or out of the ward.

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:03.971
I wanna watch that footage.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.116
Listen.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:19.854
The only person who could have
killed your mother is you.

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:23.458
Now, I don't think
I can prove that,

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.828
but if you like,
I can give it a damn good try.

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:29.757
Asha, it's me, Ronnie.
I need to talk to you.

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:32.293
I need your help
with something.

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:35.563
I wanna talk to the family
of the girl that was murdered.

01:15:37.267 --> 01:15:39.734
The case has been closed,
Ronnie.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:41.536
He's not the real killer.

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.037
My father suspended me
from duty.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.805
It's over.

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:46.741
But that's not
what you believe, is it?

01:15:46.743 --> 01:15:49.677
I don't know
what I believe in anymore.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.812
That kid didn't do this.

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:53.714
Your dad knows it.

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:55.716
He just needed
to make an arrest.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:16:00.621
Why are you still doing this?
Maybe my father was right.

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:02.623
You should just go back home
for your own good.

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:03.658
I can't.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.993
If I just leave this,

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:08.563
how do I know it won't
follow me back to England?

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:12.733
The victims were all close
to the killer 28 years ago

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.037
Maybe my Mum is somehow
connected to this girl's family?

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.982
Write it down.
You have a pen?

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:29.283
Yeah.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:33.688
It's Golback Road.

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.223
45A Karun Apartments.

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.359
The girl's father's name
is Roger Degosh.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.362
Roger?

01:16:41.364 --> 01:16:42.964
What is it?

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:27.341
I'm very sorry to disturb you.

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:29.844
May I talk to you
about your daughter Sekonia?

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:32.980
Why? Who are you?

01:17:36.653 --> 01:17:39.020
My mother was killed.

01:17:39.022 --> 01:17:40.988
I think the same person
may be responsible.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:46.894
I'm sorry.

01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:48.763
Okay, come in.

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:50.197
Hashminda!

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:51.866
Come in 10 minutes.

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:04.445
Come.

01:18:08.418 --> 01:18:11.786
Can I offer you
a cup of tea, uh...

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:14.422
Mr. Degosh, may I show you
a picture of my mother?

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:39.780
Ronnie?

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:48.789
She told me you were dead.

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:20.921
We keep on being told
that the power cuts will stop,

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:25.059
but they really have been
getting worse.

01:19:27.897 --> 01:19:29.897
Why did Mum leave India?

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:38.105
What did she tell you?

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:42.109
The story I know now
is completely untrue.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:46.380
I didn't even know I was
born here until five days ago,

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:48.983
when Uncle Mohan told me.

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:54.088
What really happened?

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:59.093
As soon as you were born,
you got very sick.

01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:02.496
The doctors were certain
that you wouldn't last the week.

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:05.232
What was wrong with me?

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:07.468
It was your heart.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.137
After four days,
the doctors told us

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:14.942
that they were going to try
a last ditch operation,

01:20:14.944 --> 01:20:19.213
but... we must prepare
for the worst.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:23.117
But I got better.

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:25.119
I survived.

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:27.354
The scar on my chest
is from the operation.

01:20:36.566 --> 01:20:38.933
Your mother
used to go to séances.

01:20:38.935 --> 01:20:41.235
Did Mohan tell you that?

01:20:43.105 --> 01:20:46.373
Without telling me, she took you
from your hospital bed

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:48.475
before they could operate.

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:50.845
Where did she take me?

01:20:52.315 --> 01:20:57.284
I found her back at our flat
just before dawn,

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:01.055
packing a suitcase,

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:05.326
and you were lying
in a basket

01:21:05.328 --> 01:21:07.561
by her bed.

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:12.566
You had a fresh scar
all the way down your chest.

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:15.202
But you seemed...

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.271
you seemed better.

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:21.575
She took me to Rakhee,
didn't she?

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:30.317
You know about her.

01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:35.122
Your mother told me
that Rakhee had cured you

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:38.425
and that we had to leave India
right this moment.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:41.128
Go far away.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.030
I couldn't accept it.

01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:48.969
I told her I didn't believe
in witchcraft.

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:51.071
I refused to leave.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.607
But when I woke up
the next morning,

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:55.609
you were both gone.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.380
What did Rakhee do to me?

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:01.348
I don't know.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:04.551
Tell me what my mum said.

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:10.258
Tell me!

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.593
All she said was that Rakhee
had brought you back to us

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.361
from the other side.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.326
Hashminda?

01:22:57.073 --> 01:23:02.109
Arun's victims
were all close to him.

01:23:02.111 --> 01:23:05.446
This time they're all
close to me.

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:08.415
My mum, my half-sister.

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:11.518
AJ's kid had that dream
that he'd be killed.

01:23:14.357 --> 01:23:18.559
Seven souls in seven nights,
remember?

01:23:18.561 --> 01:23:21.161
That's what the scroll said.
It's gonna be okay.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:22.596
What?

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:25.132
Your half-sister
was killed six days ago.

01:23:25.134 --> 01:23:27.568
This week ends in...

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.670
four hours.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:34.174
Fuck.

01:23:36.112 --> 01:23:37.411
Ronnie.

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:42.149
It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.419
It's gonna be...

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:59.359
Stop!

01:24:59.361 --> 01:25:00.461
Oh!

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:04.698
What the fuck was that?

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.100
I'm sorry.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:08.335
What happened?

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:10.337
I don't know.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:16.410
<i>Ronnie...</i>

01:25:29.225 --> 01:25:32.759
Asha, it's me.

01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:44.231
Thank you.

01:27:31.247 --> 01:27:34.648
Excuse me, do you recognize
any of these buildings?

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:44.725
I want you to find
this building.

01:27:44.727 --> 01:27:45.959
This one here.

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:11.618
Please wait for me, okay?

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.955
I will triple
what's on your meter, yeah?

01:30:29.992 --> 01:30:31.558
You killed them all.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:36.696
I don't speak Bengali.
I can only understand--

01:31:47.636 --> 01:31:49.636
Where did you hide it?

01:33:22.798 --> 01:33:24.931
What?

01:33:24.933 --> 01:33:26.733
What foreign girl?

01:33:40.082 --> 01:33:41.982
No.

01:33:41.984 --> 01:33:45.919
No! No!

01:33:51.893 --> 01:33:53.927
Oh, Jesus, you're here.

01:33:53.929 --> 01:33:55.762
AJ, it's me, Ronnie!

01:33:56.898 --> 01:33:58.732
Ronnie.

01:33:58.734 --> 01:34:00.033
Thank God, yeah.

01:34:00.035 --> 01:34:01.768
Where have you been?

01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:03.803
I got people looking for you
all over Kolkata.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:05.805
Come, come, come, come.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:07.307
I was really starting
to freak out

01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:09.376
when you didn't come home
before sundown.

01:34:09.378 --> 01:34:11.177
Hey, you want a drink
or what?

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:13.680
- Where is she?
- Who?

01:34:13.682 --> 01:34:15.749
- Lena.
- Who's Lena?

01:34:15.751 --> 01:34:17.917
My girlfriend Lena from the UK.
She's here.

01:34:17.919 --> 01:34:20.720
No, man, there's no one here.

01:34:20.722 --> 01:34:22.756
Is she coming in tonight?

01:34:22.758 --> 01:34:25.792
No. Maybe.

01:34:27.429 --> 01:34:29.429
Let me get you a cup of tea.

01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:33.299
I just made some.
You look beat, bro.

01:34:33.301 --> 01:34:34.901
Sure.

01:34:39.775 --> 01:34:44.244
Give me Lena's flight details,
and I'll go get her myself.

01:34:44.246 --> 01:34:46.813
You remember how chaotic
the airport is.

01:34:58.193 --> 01:34:59.826
Lena!

01:35:02.464 --> 01:35:03.963
Lena.

01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:08.068
Ronnie?

01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:09.436
Thank God, man.

01:35:09.438 --> 01:35:12.439
Where have you been?

01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:13.773
What's the matter, bro?

01:35:23.118 --> 01:35:25.418
It's very easy to get lost
at the airport.

01:35:38.266 --> 01:35:40.200
What are you doing, man?

01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:48.875
- AJ, AJ...
- What?

01:35:50.312 --> 01:35:51.377
Where's Lena?

01:35:51.379 --> 01:35:53.780
AJ, AJ!

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:58.384
Lena?

01:35:58.386 --> 01:36:00.186
Lena!

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:02.455
Daddy's dead!

01:36:02.457 --> 01:36:04.224
He's lying in the kitchen!

01:36:04.226 --> 01:36:05.325
Lena!

01:36:05.327 --> 01:36:06.392
Is that a Bengali number?

01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:07.494
Yes, it's a three.

01:36:07.496 --> 01:36:09.362
- You're dreaming.
- Lena!

01:36:16.004 --> 01:36:17.103
Lena?

01:36:25.881 --> 01:36:28.181
Lena? Lena?

01:36:28.183 --> 01:36:30.416
Lena. Oh, my God.
Stay with me.

01:36:32.053 --> 01:36:34.788
Okay, Lena,
get your arm around me.

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:38.825
You can do this. Come on.
One, two, three, go.

01:36:38.827 --> 01:36:41.027
Come on, stay with me.
Stay with me.

01:36:41.029 --> 01:36:43.196
Help! Help!
Please help me!

01:36:46.535 --> 01:36:48.334
Just hold onto my hand, okay?
Just hold onto my hand.

01:36:48.336 --> 01:36:49.469
Yeah, good.
You're doing great.

01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:51.304
Wait.

01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:52.939
What's he injecting into me?

01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:54.207
She is losing pressure.

01:36:54.209 --> 01:36:55.942
He's just doing his job, okay?

01:36:55.944 --> 01:36:57.210
You're gonna be fine, babe.

01:36:57.212 --> 01:36:59.379
I need to talk to you.

01:36:59.381 --> 01:37:02.182
Remember me...

01:37:02.184 --> 01:37:06.553
me talking to you in bed
after the gig?

01:37:06.555 --> 01:37:10.957
Yeah. You said that you
weren't sure about touring

01:37:10.959 --> 01:37:12.559
and that, um...

01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:14.594
and that you wanted us
to spend more time together.

01:37:14.596 --> 01:37:18.064
- Need to tell you something.
- What is it?

01:37:18.066 --> 01:37:20.166
I'm pregnant.

01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:34.981
Lena! Lena! Lena!

01:37:34.983 --> 01:37:36.549
Lena! Oh, my God.

01:37:39.187 --> 01:37:41.354
No, no, no, no, no.

01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:04.043
No. No!

01:38:05.046 --> 01:38:06.079
No!

01:38:35.076 --> 01:38:36.542
<i>Kali Yuga's coming.</i>

01:38:36.544 --> 01:38:40.480
<i>A time when demons
walk the Earth again.</i>

01:38:40.482 --> 01:38:42.649
<i>Families kill each other.</i>

01:38:42.651 --> 01:38:44.617
<i>Apocalypse.</i>

01:38:56.231 --> 01:38:57.397
No.

01:38:59.501 --> 01:39:01.501
I'm not gonna let you win.

01:40:56.151 --> 01:40:58.284
No! No!

01:40:58.286 --> 01:40:59.485
No! Stop it!

01:40:59.487 --> 01:41:00.686
No, please!
