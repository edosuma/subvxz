01:36.764 --> 01:39.233
Man:
time travel...

01:39.267 --> 01:42.903
Will turn your brain into
spaghetti if you let it.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.173
Best not
to think about it.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.276
Best just to get on
with the job in hand,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.944
Which is destroying the enemy
before they're even born

01:50.978 --> 01:53.046
And have a chance
to threaten us.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.049
We're expecting
any resistance to be light

01:56.083 --> 01:59.720
As the ancestors of our enemies
have yet to evolve any thumbs...

01:59.753 --> 02:02.690
Or indeed spines.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.793
But that does not change the fact
that they may one day evolve

02:05.826 --> 02:08.395
Into a species that
may pose a threat to us.

02:08.429 --> 02:12.300
And for that reason we are gonna
rain down a fiery death upon them

02:12.333 --> 02:16.103
That will turn the surface of their
planet into a radioactive desert!

02:16.136 --> 02:18.772
Because we are
the planetary peace corps,

02:18.806 --> 02:20.474
And that is what we do!

02:20.508 --> 02:23.244
Now...

02:23.277 --> 02:26.079
Are you nappy-Wearing
motherfuckers ready

02:26.113 --> 02:29.983
To lock 'n' load
and get it on?!

02:36.924 --> 02:38.892
No no no no, shh.

02:38.926 --> 02:42.630
Look, it's not even
a real gun! Ooh ooh.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.633
Ooh. Look at all
the lights!

02:50.170 --> 02:53.841
Shut up!

04:15.456 --> 04:17.891
Man over p.A.:
Due to technical difficulties,

04:17.925 --> 04:21.695
Star ride is closed
until further notice.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.433
Due to technical
difficulties,

04:25.466 --> 04:29.537
Star ride is closed
until further notice.

04:30.804 --> 04:36.544
Two for one
at dinoburger.

04:36.577 --> 04:39.279
It doesn't even make any sense.
Why would we do this?

04:39.313 --> 04:41.782
Toby, don't start.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.618
Bye, love.
All right, love, two for one at dinoburger.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.688
We're encouraging people to eat dinosaurs...
to eat us, you know?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.122
Why do we do that?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.991
We're not real dinosaurs.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.260
We should be dressed
as cavemen.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.162
Tobe, why do you
always do this?

04:55.195 --> 04:56.630
You were the same
on the bloody ghost train.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.199
That wasn't logical either.
Everyone knows

04:59.232 --> 05:01.301
Werewolves and vampires
are natural enemies.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.872
There is no way they would
team up to attack a train.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.074
- Toby, stop thinking...
- Yeah...

05:07.107 --> 05:08.876
...and talking.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.811
Yeah, you're right,
actually.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.413
We can't think
that much

05:12.446 --> 05:14.748
Because a dinosaur's brain is
only the size of a walnut.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.117
As far as talking goes,
you know, it's just like...

05:24.992 --> 05:27.094
Tobe, tobe, tobe,
stop it.

05:27.127 --> 05:30.097
You wanna be careful you
don't get lost in the role.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.800
I heard of this one guy
over on the star ride

05:32.833 --> 05:34.735
Actually thought
he was a space ranger...

05:34.768 --> 05:37.405
Traumatized a load of kids.
They sacked him.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.306
Oh, hello, ray.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.709
Didn't see you there.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.944
Pete, tobe.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.913
- It was a crappy job, anyway.
- Yeah.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.248
- Boy: loser.
- Says the man dressed as a dinosaur.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.990
So what are
you gonna do?

05:57.024 --> 05:59.693
I don't know.
I was thinking about maybe moving back home,

05:59.727 --> 06:01.862
Taking that job
at my uncle's place.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.932
Why would you wanna do that?
We can get you another job here.

06:04.965 --> 06:08.235
- Where?
- Barry burp's bubble ride.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.471
Get you a job there easy.
High turnover

06:10.504 --> 06:13.474
- 'Cause of the chlorine in the eyes.
- Mmm, it is tempting,

06:13.507 --> 06:16.143
But there should be more to life
than dressing up as a bubble.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.949
Maybe it's time
to get real.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.084
So...

06:24.117 --> 06:27.688
In an ideal world what
would be your perfect job?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.156
I don't know...
comics shop?

06:29.189 --> 06:31.692
Oh, come on.
Think bigger.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.127
Astronaut.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.664
Yeah, cool,

06:36.697 --> 06:38.899
But i mean your
absolute dream job.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.669
I mean, if there was
no limit at all.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.336
No limits?

06:43.370 --> 06:46.640
Well, it's obvious.
It's gotta be time lord.

06:46.674 --> 06:51.044
Oh, come to daddy.
Ooh, what's that,

06:51.078 --> 06:53.246
Four minutes, 32?

06:53.280 --> 06:56.149
- That's bollocks. You led him on.
- What's this?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.318
It was a bet. He reckoned you
were gonna mention time travel

06:58.351 --> 07:01.188
- In under five minutes.
- You're making bets on me?!

07:01.221 --> 07:03.524
The day i get fired
you're making bets on me!

07:03.557 --> 07:06.259
He did.
I didn't want to.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.928
I do talk about other things,
you know?

07:07.961 --> 07:10.197
What?
Like sci-Fi?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.299
Ahem.
How many times?

07:12.332 --> 07:14.067
It's not sci-Fi, pete.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.037
It's science fiction,
or s.F.,

07:17.070 --> 07:19.540
Which can also stand
for speculative fiction.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.610
Jesus. You wonder why
you can't get laid.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.645
I can.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.647
I do.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.517
Some girls are
into science fiction.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.685
Yeah, you see,
that's your problem, ray.

07:31.719 --> 07:34.387
Your ideal girl
is you...

07:34.421 --> 07:37.625
With tits.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.328
In fact,
your ideal girl is him...

07:41.361 --> 07:44.431
- With tits.
- I object to that.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.235
- Ray: now that was a shit film.
- Toby: yeah.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.437
Ray: someone should write
a letter and complain, eh?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.173
"Dear hollywood,
you're shit."

07:53.206 --> 07:56.009
I mean, how hard can it be to
make a film that doesn't suck?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.745
I've got millions
of great ideas.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.880
- Like what?
- What?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.115
Oh, come on,
i wanna hear one of your great ideas.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.184
Okay.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.122
Right.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.992
Prepare
to be amazed.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.461
"Ninja yodeler."

08:14.494 --> 08:17.798
Are you just like saying random words,
tobe?

08:17.831 --> 08:21.602
No... yodeler by day,
ninja by night, you see?

08:21.635 --> 08:24.572
Oh, yeah, because the other way
around would be really stupous.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.306
Stupid.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.176
No, you've got ninjas
who are really quiet, yeah?

08:29.209 --> 08:32.813
Yodelers... really loud!
There's the conflict for the character...

08:32.846 --> 08:34.881
Torn between
two roles.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.517
He's really thought
about this.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.621
Okay, all right, cool.
You know the way that sometimes you come up

08:40.654 --> 08:42.690
With a really shit idea,
like, on purpose,

08:42.722 --> 08:45.926
- To try and test us out?
- Yeah?

08:45.959 --> 08:48.428
Is this one?

08:48.461 --> 08:50.964
Yeah, you got me.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.668
- Nearly had you, though.
- Had him.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.204
Yeah.
"Ninja yodeler"?

08:57.237 --> 08:58.839
"Ninja yodeler."

08:58.872 --> 09:00.808
How's your
real script going?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.676
Uh, i'm doing most
of the work up here, really.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.712
Besides, every writer
needs to get out

09:04.745 --> 09:06.479
In the real world,

09:06.513 --> 09:09.449
Have some experiences...
fresh ones... to enrich his work.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.118
Really?

09:11.151 --> 09:15.122
I thought a writer needed
to stay in and write.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.659
Yeah, it's the eternal
enigma of creativity.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.794
We should discuss it
in the pub.

09:20.828 --> 09:24.431
- Give me that.
- Oi! Oh, you thieving git!

09:24.464 --> 09:26.066
I said that!

09:26.099 --> 09:27.735
Come on, all great
writers steal.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.369
Oh, ray said that!

09:29.402 --> 09:32.039
Give it to me.
Give me my book.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.074
Come on.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.946
You'll see.
One day, i'll be famous

09:38.979 --> 09:41.181
And then
you'll be sorry.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.753
Toby: "dear hollywood,

09:45.786 --> 09:49.022
Please stop making
so many crappy movies.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.125
Here are a few tips
to help you out:

09:52.159 --> 09:54.828
One, story is king...

09:54.862 --> 09:57.130
Always has been,
always will be."

09:57.164 --> 09:59.299
This is eating
into our drinking time.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.602
Jude law...

10:02.636 --> 10:05.839
...han shot first,

10:05.873 --> 10:09.242
More 'firefly'
and/or 'serenity.'

10:09.276 --> 10:10.844
The end."

10:10.878 --> 10:13.180
Well, that's
hollywood sorted.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.615
Shall we move on
to the middle east?

10:15.649 --> 10:18.051
- The pen's running out.
- Oh. Always the way.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.453
Nerds.
- Hey.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.522
Didn't we all agree to
stop using the n-Word?

10:22.555 --> 10:24.624
- Didn't we?
- I don't remember.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.094
"Nerd" is the word
they use to keep us down.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.963
You should use
the term...

10:29.997 --> 10:32.632
- "Imagineer."
- Yeah.

10:34.401 --> 10:38.105
That's the nerdiest thing
i've ever heard.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.807
You are just
threatened.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.776
You're threatened because you
don't understand our world.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.178
What's there to understand?
I saw one "star trek" film.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.281
- I hated it and never looked back.
- Really? Which one?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.250
The first one
with the big gold robot

10:50.283 --> 10:52.853
And the little
fat mailer.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.956
You mean "star wars,"
don't you?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.325
Do i? Aren't they
the same thing?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.228
No. No, they're not.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.430
- He knows.
- Pete: how would i know?

11:03.463 --> 11:05.398
I'm not a nerd

11:05.432 --> 11:07.434
Or even an imagineer.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.503
- Better.
- I'm glad you're happy.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.605
Whose round is it?

11:12.639 --> 11:15.242
- Nuh-Uh.
- I got the last round.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.609
Yeah, i got the biscuits
from the garage.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.245
I paid for you to get
into scandals that time.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.713
Toby: i paid
for the cloakroom.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.548
I bought tea bags around
when you ran out.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.650
I lent you my coat.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.953
The snug's
less busy.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.155
Toby:
can you get me some crisps?

11:29.456 --> 11:31.458
Thanks.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.266
He could be wearing
stealth lederhosen.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.234
Jesus, you took
your time.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.003
- Yes, i did.
- I'll get the next round.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.338
Well done,
i was impressed.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.276
- What?
- It's a lot of effort to go to.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.011
I mean, i'm uh...

11:51.044 --> 11:53.814
- I'm rather touched.
- What are you talking about?

11:53.847 --> 11:56.549
Cassie...
next door...

11:56.583 --> 11:58.986
She fed me
her little story.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.054
- Cassie?
- The girl in the snug.

12:01.088 --> 12:05.092
Come on, guys...
fit, funny, dodgy american accent.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.327
- You set it up.
- Just now?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.229
Yeah.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.664
Look, whatever.
I just wanna say thank you,

12:11.698 --> 12:14.534
'Cause i think i might actually
be in with a little chance there.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.369
Ooh, i could see why you'd
think it would be a wind-Up.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.306
- You wanna hear what happened or not?
- Absolutely.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.208
Go on, make her
double-Jointed.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.077
Toby: ignore him.
Come on, i wanna hear it.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.312
Okay.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.586
Cassie:
hello, ray.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.755
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.758
I... i'm sorry.
Do i know you?

12:38.792 --> 12:40.693
I'm cassie.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.595
- Ooh.
- You don't know me,

12:42.629 --> 12:45.698
But i know you very well...
at least, uh,

12:45.732 --> 12:47.835
I feel like i do.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.403
I've read all about you.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.739
- All about me?
- Yeah.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.309
I guess from your perspective those
books haven't been written yet,

12:56.343 --> 12:59.046
- But, uh...
- Haven't been written yet,

12:59.079 --> 13:00.914
Like from the future?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.282
Exactly.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.386
Ah.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.222
Ah, i see.
You're a time traveler.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.557
Bingo. Yes!

13:10.590 --> 13:13.726
I didn't say
i believed her.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.429
- You have invented a girlfriend, haven't you?
- I have not.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.032
Time-Traveling hottie
visits time-Travel fan.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.567
It's not a bad idea.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.035
How far back in time
have you come?

13:22.069 --> 13:24.037
150 years.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.039
And where is your, uh...
where's your time machine?

13:26.073 --> 13:27.407
Inside me.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.442
Oh! That's handy.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.880
Is it like, uh,
a little pill?

13:32.913 --> 13:35.548
Uh, no. It's been
hardwired into my bones,

13:35.582 --> 13:37.951
Which have been replaced
with a polymer composite.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.954
So it's flexible,
but very standard-Issue.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.422
Are you a...

13:42.455 --> 13:45.558
Space lady? Hello.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.061
Nanoo.
Phone home.

13:48.095 --> 13:51.731
No. No, i repair
time leaks.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.401
- Sounds exciting.
- No.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.603
No, it's not, really.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.271
It's quite dull.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.173
This is the only
perk of the job.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.574
What is?

14:01.608 --> 14:04.011
Meeting famous people
from history.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.013
Me?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.348
I've read that you'd be
in here on this day,

14:08.381 --> 14:10.017
And, oh...

14:10.050 --> 14:13.686
I just couldn't pass up a chance
of meeting ray the great.

14:14.888 --> 14:15.923
It's what she said.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.258
"Ray the great."

14:18.291 --> 14:19.526
Shut up.

14:19.559 --> 14:23.630
So what other famous
people like me...

14:23.663 --> 14:25.498
Have you met?
Have you met einstein?

14:25.532 --> 14:28.201
Or elvis?
Have you met elvis?

14:28.235 --> 14:31.271
You know what you should do?
You should go back and kill hitler.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.540
- That's a classic.
- That's also a time crime.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.608
You're no fun.

14:35.642 --> 14:39.312
Yeah, we call it editing...
trying to erase people from history.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.381
- Like hitler.
- Yeah, like hitler,

14:41.414 --> 14:45.618
But a lot of the time it's more
of a personal taste thing.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.121
Like... paris hilton.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.557
- Who?
- Brilliant.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.259
Oh. Well, um...

14:52.292 --> 14:54.661
Yeah, they try
to erase them from history

14:54.694 --> 14:57.564
Just because they don't like them
or they don't like their songs

14:57.597 --> 14:59.232
Or their films
or whatever.

14:59.266 --> 15:02.069
They are totally
psychotic, ray.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.972
There's even one bunch of editors
who will try to kill artists

15:05.005 --> 15:08.175
- Immediately after their greatest works.
- I don't get it.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.944
Well, it's to avoid
a decline in quality.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.347
It'd be like
killing, say...

15:14.381 --> 15:16.883
Kevin costner right after
"dances with wolves."

15:16.916 --> 15:19.352
- You could do morrissey...
- After the smiths?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.921
No, just generally.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.523
George lucas
after "jedi."

15:23.556 --> 15:25.258
Oh, "empire" surely.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.394
Nuh-Uh, you'd miss
the ewok battle.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.563
- Who cares?
- I care.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.233
Ray:
let's see how good your research really is.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.602
What is...
ahem...

15:35.635 --> 15:37.837
The grandfather paradox?

15:37.870 --> 15:39.772
I...

15:39.806 --> 15:41.774
I've gotta be honest
with you, ray.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.377
I didn't exactly
finish the manual.

15:44.411 --> 15:48.215
It was like a brick. I'm more of a
quick-Start- Pamphlet kind of girl.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.784
Yes, sure.
I mean, hey, who's got the time?

15:51.818 --> 15:53.786
It's only history
we're messing with.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.822
Look, i'm not
totally stupid.

15:55.855 --> 15:59.226
I mean, i can safely talk to
you because everyone knows

15:59.259 --> 16:01.128
That you are obsessed
with time travel.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.430
- So?
- So...

16:03.463 --> 16:05.565
No one will believe you when
you tell them about this.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.901
Very clever, ray.
Double bluff.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.405
- I still don't believe you.
- What about chaos theory?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.207
You do know about
chaos theory, right?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.409
Yes, of course!

16:16.443 --> 16:18.278
Chaos theory
is the idea

16:18.311 --> 16:22.115
That all actions
have consequences.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.753
When you take that
quantumly...

16:26.786 --> 16:28.855
Okay, um,

16:28.888 --> 16:31.358
When you are talking
about this stuff,

16:31.391 --> 16:34.261
It might be a good idea to speak
with a bit more confidence about it.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.296
Okay.
Well, i will.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.465
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.668
Chaos theory is basically the idea that
tiny things can have huge consequences.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.736
So because you delayed me
from going through there,

16:43.770 --> 16:46.506
All the little things that i was going
to do have been delayed subsequently.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.141
And that has
a knock-On effect,

16:48.175 --> 16:50.277
Which can totally change
the future.

16:50.310 --> 16:54.081
So... so, wait. That means you're going
to drink your pint a little bit later,

16:54.114 --> 16:58.017
Which means you're going to go to
the bathroom a little bit later.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.220
My god, ray,
you're right!

17:00.253 --> 17:04.156
That's terrible!
We're all doomed.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.863
Do you have any idea how rare it is to
find a girl who's into science fiction

17:10.896 --> 17:12.799
Who doesn't have
everything pierced?

17:12.832 --> 17:15.135
How do you know
i haven't?

17:17.204 --> 17:20.173
Listen, you should
come through, join us.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.541
I'll tell the guys
what a good job you did.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.477
Have they paid you yet?
I could get you a tip.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.480
Not in a stripper kind of way,
because you're not a stripper,

17:27.513 --> 17:29.482
Obviously.
Not that you wouldn't make a good one...

17:29.516 --> 17:32.419
You'd make a fine one.
I'm sure you'd look great naked.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.522
Well put.

17:35.555 --> 17:39.859
No, thank you.
I-I have to go, actually.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.629
Oh, no.
Oh, what's the rush?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.831
Look, i've got a time leak
to find, remember?

17:44.864 --> 17:47.734
Of course.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.204
Okay, um,
well, i'll...

17:51.238 --> 17:52.905
See you later, then.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.975
Hey, in the future,
maybe.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.910
Yeah. Maybe.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.679
- Could you...
- Oh, yeah.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.714
I'm sorry.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.250
Thank...

18:06.686 --> 18:08.321
Bye, ray.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.822
Bye.

18:09.856 --> 18:13.126
Not bad,
not bad at all.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.996
Can't really say i'm buying the
time-Traveling- Skeleton thing...

18:17.029 --> 18:18.565
A bit too "terminator."

18:18.598 --> 18:21.468
- No, but i like sexy time-Traveler.
- Mmm.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.370
- How does it end?
- I don't know

18:23.403 --> 18:25.538
'Cause i'm not making it up.
She was real.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.407
I know what it is.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.610
You know how you can pay a prostitute
to act things out for you?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.545
No, i don't.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.815
Someone who knows ray really well has
treated him to a time-Traveling hooker.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.417
She was nice.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.619
And you didn't even
sleep with her.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.921
That was probably
in with the price.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.590
She wasn't a prostitute.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.592
You should have slept with her.
You know why?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.827
- Why?
- 'Cause she'd have probably shagged you

18:47.860 --> 18:49.762
Into the middle
of the next week.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.502
Ay. Ay.
Come on.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.770
Come on.
Thank you, thank you.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.072
My name's pete and
i will be here all week.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.442
Down those.
We'll catch last orders at the king's head.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.477
I'm gonna
take a leak.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.348
Oh, because
of the future thing.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.049
- Mmm.
- Ah.

19:11.184 --> 19:15.855
* and i need you
now tonight *

19:15.888 --> 19:19.659
* and i need you
more than ever *

19:19.692 --> 19:22.929
* and if you'll only
hold me tight *

19:22.962 --> 19:26.165
* we'll be holding on
forever *

19:26.199 --> 19:30.036
* and we'll only be
making it right *

19:30.069 --> 19:32.739
* 'cause we'll never be
wrong together *

19:32.772 --> 19:35.342
* we can take it
to the end of the line *

19:35.375 --> 19:37.610
* your love is
like a shadow on me *

19:37.644 --> 19:40.980
* all of the time

19:41.013 --> 19:44.984
* i don't know what to do
and i'm always in the dark *

19:45.017 --> 19:48.955
* we're living in a powder
keg and giving off sparks *

19:48.988 --> 19:52.191
* i really
need you tonight *

19:52.225 --> 19:55.862
* forever's gonna
start tonight *

19:55.895 --> 19:58.865
* forever's
gonna start tonight *

19:58.898 --> 20:02.469
* once upon a time
i was falling in love *

20:02.502 --> 20:06.673
* but now i'm only
falling apart *

20:06.706 --> 20:09.276
* there's nothing
i can say *

20:09.309 --> 20:11.778
* a total eclipse
of the heart... *

20:18.385 --> 20:21.821
* now i'm
only falling apart *

20:21.854 --> 20:23.756
* nothing i can say

20:23.790 --> 20:26.859
* a total eclipse
of the heart... *

20:26.893 --> 20:30.330
* run for the sun,
little one *

20:30.363 --> 20:34.501
* you're an outlaw
once again, time to change *

20:34.534 --> 20:40.106
* superman will be
with us while he can... *

21:01.093 --> 21:03.763
Pete:
oh my god!

21:06.433 --> 21:09.068
It's me.

22:03.656 --> 22:09.662
* forever is gonna
start tonight *

22:09.696 --> 22:12.732
* once upon a time
i was falling in love *

22:12.765 --> 22:16.769
* now i'm only
falling apart... *

22:18.371 --> 22:20.407
* there's nothing
i can say *

22:20.440 --> 22:25.378
* a total eclipse
of the heart... *

22:28.014 --> 22:32.719
* a total eclipse
of the heart... *

22:34.854 --> 22:36.856
Are we off then?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.826
Oh, shit.
I will see your time-Traveling hottie

22:39.859 --> 22:41.828
And raise you
a pub full of dead bodies.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.697
Is that piss
on your jeans?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.635
No...

22:48.668 --> 22:50.870
Not all of it.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.472
Bollocks.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.874
Couldn't this be that leak that
your woman was looking for?

22:54.907 --> 22:56.409
So you believe me
now, do you?

22:56.443 --> 22:57.810
I still don't,
for the record.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.379
After all i've just seen,
i'll believe anything.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.649
Guys, i just saw
my own dead face.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.284
Ooh.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.487
Go in yourself.
You'll see.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.056
I don't know.
First a future woman,

23:10.089 --> 23:11.758
And now this.
It's...

23:11.791 --> 23:14.794
It's like a time-Travel
murder mystery.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.763
- You guys...
- It's not me!

23:16.796 --> 23:18.998
- Yeah.
- Are you winding us up?

23:19.031 --> 23:20.533
No!

23:20.567 --> 23:23.770
Look, something very bad
is gonna happen.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.305
I've just had a premonition
of my own death.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.808
Then why don't you just leave?
If you're so spooked,

23:28.841 --> 23:31.377
Why don't you just run away?
Go home.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.179
- Right.
- Pete: because it's not tonight.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.148
The other me... the dead me...
he had a beard.

23:36.182 --> 23:40.252
Oh, i see,
a little beard.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.522
A tenner says something
happens when you go in.

23:42.555 --> 23:45.758
Another bet. What little trick have
you got up your sleeve, right, petey?

23:45.792 --> 23:47.727
Oh, this is great.
This is...

23:47.760 --> 23:49.161
Come on,
let's all go.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.397
No chance,
i'm staying right here.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.766
Well, get
my money ready.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.468
- Come on.
- Are we gonna go in?

23:55.502 --> 23:58.104
Oh, brilliant.

24:08.347 --> 24:12.251
- Man: are those two dead?
- What? What do you mean?

24:12.284 --> 24:15.454
Are those two dead?

24:17.156 --> 24:20.226
Oh. No, not yet.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.266
Pack it in.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.401
Hello, petey.
Change your mind?

24:29.435 --> 24:31.938
No, i'm just gonna
watch from here.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.274
Ugh, it certainly
smells like someone died.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.577
Shit shit shit,
what the fuck are you doing?

24:37.610 --> 24:39.612
If you've got anything planned,
you're gonna get it too.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.181
I haven't got anything planned.
Will you let me out, please?!

24:42.214 --> 24:44.216
- No!
- Oh shit.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.885
I'm in again.
Oh shit!

24:45.918 --> 24:48.821
- Ray, check the loos.
- What?

24:48.855 --> 24:51.090
Probably got some bloke
in a "scream" mask.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.661
Or something even
more brilliant.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.332
Ooh, it really does
stink in here.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.069
- You might as well just pay me now.
- Ooh, look at this.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.804
It's like a dungy,
zooey kind of a...

25:04.837 --> 25:06.673
It's pete's bullshit
you can smell.

25:06.706 --> 25:10.643
Listen!
This isn't a wind-Up.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.114
Do you really wanna
see the future?

25:15.147 --> 25:17.116
I'd love to.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.484
Okay.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.452
You've got to do
exactly what i did.

25:20.486 --> 25:22.955
What do you mean?

25:22.989 --> 25:25.958
All:
* and if you'll only hold me tight *

25:25.992 --> 25:27.493
* we'll be
holding on forever... *

25:27.526 --> 25:29.028
I can't believe
i'm doing this.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.730
I feel like
i'm doing the conga

25:30.763 --> 25:33.365
- At a really shit party.
- * and we'll never be...

25:33.399 --> 25:35.334
Oh, is this really
necessary, the...

25:35.367 --> 25:37.870
I don't know, it might... don't look!
I can't do it if you look.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.806
I wasn't.
I wasn't.

25:39.839 --> 25:43.142
* together we can make it
to the end of the line *

25:43.175 --> 25:47.179
* your love is like a shadow
on me all of the time... *

25:47.213 --> 25:49.348
- Right, hold on.
- Toby: what?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.217
Toby:
there must be easier ways to make money.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.822
It's a science
experiment.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.657
Mm-Hmm.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.827
Hold on tight
for this bit.

26:00.860 --> 26:04.997
* i don't know what to do,
i'm always in the dark *

26:05.031 --> 26:08.167
* we're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks... *

26:08.200 --> 26:09.736
Wait a minute,
here's an idea...

26:09.769 --> 26:12.238
Instead of a time machine that
runs on karaoke and urine,

26:12.271 --> 26:14.206
Maybe they could have
one with a dial on,

26:14.240 --> 26:16.208
You know,
with dates on it...

26:16.242 --> 26:18.044
Something crazy
like that.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.047
- * i really need you tonight...
* - Oh, thanks.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.316
* forever's
gonna start tonight *

26:24.350 --> 26:26.185
* forever's
gonna start to... *

26:26.218 --> 26:29.521
* once upon a time
i was falling in love *

26:29.555 --> 26:31.858
* now i'm only
falling apart... *

26:31.891 --> 26:33.860
Toby: do you really do this
every time you take a piss?

26:33.893 --> 26:36.595
- A tenner says something happens.
- Yeah.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.564
It's got to be
something definite,

26:38.597 --> 26:41.567
Like say, a pub full
of dead people...

26:41.600 --> 26:44.236
Not just some bollocks
weirdy feeling.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.338
Okay.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.876
* nothing i can say

26:49.909 --> 26:53.946
* a total eclipse
of the heart. *

27:01.921 --> 27:04.090
- What's that i can hear?
- Wait.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.993
Oh, come on.
What are they, the talki dead?

27:20.239 --> 27:24.310
Oh my god,
everyone's still alive.

27:27.046 --> 27:30.917
I don't know what happened out there,
but i feel dirty.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.519
Gonna get
some peanuts now.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.387
- Toby: pay up! What?
- We didn't shake hands.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.157
- What, are you 12?
- Look, i swear to you,

27:38.190 --> 27:41.360
- I saw myself right here.
- Toby: "story is king...

27:41.393 --> 27:43.395
Always has been,
always will be."

27:43.429 --> 27:46.899
Pete: this is eating
into our drinking time.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.270
Hi.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.505
- Someone's got our seats, ray.
- Have they? Oh!

27:53.539 --> 27:56.943
- Our stuff's over there.
- Yeah, they looked a bit familiar, didn't they, pete?

27:56.976 --> 27:59.578
- Just a bit.
- Probably some spare seats in the snug.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.180
That's not really
the problem, ray.

28:01.213 --> 28:04.316
- Then what's the problem?
- I think you better go look.

28:07.954 --> 28:10.522
Ray:
shall we move on to the middle east?

28:10.556 --> 28:13.025
- The pen's running out.
- Oh. Always the way.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.161
Nerds.
- Hey!

28:15.194 --> 28:18.264
Didn't we all agree to
stop using the n-Word?

28:18.297 --> 28:21.300
- Didn't we?
- Pete: i don't remember.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.535
Toby:
"nerd" is the word they use to keep us down.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.773
Ray:
you should use the term...

28:26.806 --> 28:29.208
"Imagineer."

28:31.778 --> 28:34.680
Should we get the
fuck out of here?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.182
So what do we
do now, ray?

28:36.215 --> 28:38.684
- What?
- This is your thing.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.020
This is not my thing.
No, my thing is sitting on my ass

28:41.053 --> 28:43.489
Reading books about this shit,
not actually being in it.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.492
What about the rules? There's always
rules in these things, isn't there?

28:46.525 --> 28:48.895
Yeah, but it depends
who you read.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.730
- Well, even i know some rules.
- Like what?

28:51.764 --> 28:53.966
Like... like you can't
tread on any butterflies.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.068
- What?!
- Not just butterflies... anything.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.804
You can't kill
anything in the past

28:57.837 --> 29:00.239
Because it wipes out all its
descendants in the future

29:00.272 --> 29:03.309
And you could end up wiping
out the whole human race.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.812
- Eh.
- Don't sleep with anyone. It always ends up being

29:05.845 --> 29:08.180
- Your mom or your gran.
- Oh, that's just sick.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.382
Ray, it's still tonight.
We haven't gone back to the blitz.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.985
- You asked for rules. I'm giving you rules.
- Okay, don't kill anything,

29:13.019 --> 29:15.487
Don't fuck anything.
What else?

29:15.521 --> 29:17.623
- Don't touch yourself.
- I'll be honest with you,

29:17.656 --> 29:19.525
My mind's on other
things right now.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.660
No, i mean, don't touch
the other us.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.864
We can't bump into
or speak to the earlier us.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.900
Why? Can't we just warn them
not to go into the bog?

29:27.934 --> 29:30.702
No! No. You can't do that because
that would cause a paradox.

29:30.736 --> 29:32.738
- A what?
- If they don't go into the bogs,

29:32.771 --> 29:35.607
Then they don't go back in time.
And if that doesn't happen, then...

29:35.641 --> 29:37.343
We cease to exist.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.411
It's a variant
of the grandfather paradox.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.747
I fucking
hate sci-Fi.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
Science fiction.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.885
- So we go back into the toilets.
- No!

29:45.918 --> 29:47.586
- We can't do that.
- No, that could take us anywhere.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.222
Yeah, but last time it took him
right back to where he started,

29:50.256 --> 29:52.058
- Didn't it?
- Yeah, but it also took me

29:52.091 --> 29:53.725
- To a room full of dead bodies.
- See?

29:53.759 --> 29:55.261
He's right.
It's not predictable.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.030
So where does that
leave us, ray?

29:58.064 --> 30:00.166
I think i've
got an idea.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.937
- Pete: hiding in a cupboard?
- Ray: yeah.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.606
- Pete: and that's gonna stop me being dead?
- Ray: look, it's simple...

30:07.639 --> 30:10.042
We wait for the earlier
us to go into the loos

30:10.076 --> 30:11.743
And disappear
into the past.

30:11.777 --> 30:14.546
Pete:
how long do you think that's gonna be?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.248
About another
half an hour.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.151
Oh, you're joking.
My neck's killing me already.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.653
Ow! Hot!
Ouch!

30:21.687 --> 30:23.655
Bugger. Ow!

30:23.689 --> 30:25.591
Toby:
can i sit down?

30:25.624 --> 30:27.459
Ray: i don't know.
Can you?

30:27.493 --> 30:31.197
Ray: no pulling!

30:39.471 --> 30:41.473
Ray: oh,
i think i found a light.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.783
- Maybe leave the light off.
- Pete: yeah.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.519
- Toby: yeah.
- Yeah.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.559
Anyone want
a peanut?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.262
No.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.597
You know,
i really thought time travel would be

31:05.631 --> 31:07.599
A bit more thrilling
than this.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.970
- Pete: mmm.
- I know what you mean.

31:11.003 --> 31:14.473
Oh. Oh, no,
wait a minute.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.543
- Oh my god!
- What?

31:17.576 --> 31:20.546
We're half an hour in the
past. She's still here.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.448
Both: oh.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.884
Ray: join us.
I'll tell the guys what a good job you did.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.087
Have they paid you yet?
I can get you a tip.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.457
Not in a stripper kind of way,
because obviously you're not a stripper.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.492
Not that you wouldn't
make a good one...

31:33.525 --> 31:36.228
You'd make a fine one.
I'm sure you'd look great naked.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.098
Wait a minute!

31:39.131 --> 31:41.500
What's this?

31:41.533 --> 31:44.370
I can... i can feel
a fir tree through here.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.773
There's...
there's a whole other world back here...

31:47.806 --> 31:51.877
With snow and fauns
and talking lions!

31:51.910 --> 31:53.412
Is there?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.214
No.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.117
Dick.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.918
I love "narnia."

32:02.821 --> 32:04.423
- Bye, ray.
- Bye.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.863
Cassie! Cassie!

32:11.897 --> 32:15.001
Ray, i really
have to go.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.835
Oh. Oh, no no no.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.437
You think i'm him.
I'm not him.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.339
I mean,
obviously i am.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.508
Cassie, we really need your help.
First of all,

32:22.541 --> 32:24.810
I now totally believe that
you are a time traveler.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.812
Sorry about
doubting you there.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.116
And sorry about the whole
stripper- Spacewoman thing.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.883
Okay.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.053
And second of all,
i think we found your time leak.

32:34.086 --> 32:37.023
It's in the gents'.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.925
Oh oh,

32:39.958 --> 32:43.362
Very good, very good.
So the leak is, uh...

32:43.395 --> 32:46.432
In the toilet.
Yes! Yes, it seems...

32:46.465 --> 32:48.700
- The universe has a sense of humor.
- It's very funny,

32:48.734 --> 32:50.602
And quick too.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.271
You don't believe me.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.606
- Oh, touche.
- Oh no.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.143
No no, this is
for real, okay?

32:57.176 --> 32:59.645
- Pete saw dead bodies in the pub.
- Okay, well,

32:59.678 --> 33:03.815
I-I gotta go climb back into
my spaceship and disappear.

33:03.849 --> 33:07.219
Why else would i have two
men in this cupboard?

33:07.253 --> 33:10.656
I'll see you around,
future boy.

33:10.689 --> 33:13.759
Wait! Wait, cassie.
Cassie!

33:16.295 --> 33:19.398
I think it's time we had
another little chat, ray.

33:21.900 --> 33:25.271
- So you're sure we're okay out here?
- Yes, we're fine.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.939
No one is due out in the
garden for another 23 minutes,

33:27.973 --> 33:30.042
- So...
- Okay, good.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.811
- Cassie: huh.
- Um...

33:32.844 --> 33:35.381
Ahem.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.883
- So this is a bit of a new look for you.
- Do you like it?

33:37.916 --> 33:39.051
Yes.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.087
I mean, you know,
it's very nice.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.854
- Oh.
- Very quick too.

33:42.888 --> 33:45.224
Well, not from
my point of view.

33:45.257 --> 33:48.627
It actually took quite a bit
of time to sort all this out.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.997
- Oh, yeah? How long?
- Six months.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.633
So you just went
through the door,

33:54.666 --> 33:57.536
Went to the future for six
months and then came back out...

33:57.569 --> 33:59.905
One second
after i left you.

33:59.938 --> 34:02.641
Wow.

34:02.674 --> 34:06.512
Oh, thank you.
Ahem.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.547
So, it's um...
it's all sorted, then,

34:08.580 --> 34:12.251
With the time leak
and dead bodies.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.221
Yep, all sorted.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.888
Are you sure?

34:16.922 --> 34:20.926
Ray, i didn't spend the last
six months just dyeing my hair.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.195
I'm a professional.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.530
Mmm.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.366
So what was
all this about, then?

34:27.399 --> 34:30.502
- I'm sorry, i can't tell you.
- What? Why not?

34:30.536 --> 34:33.205
Because that knowledge is
anachronous to your time period.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.507
Wow, that... that sounded like you
really knew what you're talking about.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.210
I know. I know.

34:39.245 --> 34:42.114
It's great, isn't it?
I did what you told me,

34:42.148 --> 34:44.783
And i started saying everything
with real confidence,

34:44.815 --> 34:47.186
- Even if i don't have a clue.
- Ha-Ha.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.121
It's just had
an amazing effect.

34:50.156 --> 34:54.393
- I even got a promotion.
- Really?

34:54.426 --> 34:57.529
- You got a promotion.
- Well, i...

34:57.563 --> 34:59.365
I got off probation.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.402
Mm, that's pretty
much the same.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.103
Yeah.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.407
And uh, what did you
reckon to me

35:08.440 --> 35:10.276
Avoiding that paradox
in there?

35:12.911 --> 35:14.413
Ray, you hid
in a cupboard.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.682
I thought i did very well
under the circumstances.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.851
Sure, i don't have
the manual to ignore...

35:19.885 --> 35:22.053
Will you stop it
with the manual?

35:25.691 --> 35:28.827
So how do we get back
to the right time?

35:28.860 --> 35:31.029
Well, uh,

35:31.062 --> 35:33.064
You're nearly there,
anyway.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.468
- So we'll just wait?
- Yeah.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.370
In the cupboard?

35:38.404 --> 35:40.439
I'm afraid so.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.142
No glowing portal,

35:44.176 --> 35:46.645
No vortex,
no big starship?

35:46.678 --> 35:49.114
Just sit and wait
in the cupboard?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.148
Yeah.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.222
Not exactly the glamour that i
had expected from time travel.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.589
I did warn you.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.729
Any chance i could wait
out here with you?

36:03.762 --> 36:04.963
Why?

36:04.996 --> 36:08.166
Just because...

36:08.200 --> 36:11.670
It's slightly better than
wedging myself in a cupboard

36:11.703 --> 36:14.606
With two very sweaty men...
not a good thing.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.509
No. No, i imagine not.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.678
So we'll just hang out
here for awhile.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.714
Yeah. That'd be nice.

36:25.717 --> 36:29.321
Ray: i thought you said
we had 20 minutes.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.823
Yeah, uh...

36:31.857 --> 36:33.492
It's...

36:33.525 --> 36:35.827
Not a problem.

36:35.861 --> 36:40.065
Uh, i'm just going
to go check that out...

36:40.098 --> 36:42.301
And maybe you should
get back in that cupboard.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.503
But everything is
gonna be okay?

36:44.536 --> 36:48.407
Ray, relax. I told you...
i'm a professional.

36:54.380 --> 36:58.884
Well, they do say that
things taste better outside.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.154
My god.

37:03.188 --> 37:06.858
"Things taste better
outside"?

37:06.892 --> 37:08.594
Twat.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.132
- Hang on.
- Ray: pack it in.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.467
I think this is it.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.569
Hello, petey.
Change your mind?

37:17.603 --> 37:20.739
No, i'm just gonna
watch from here.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.509
Shit shit shit,
what the fuck are you doing?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.544
Toby: if you've got anything planned,
you're gonna get it too.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.051
- Where are you going?
- We need to piss.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.454
- You can't go in there.
- You said your woman fixed it.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.890
I'm sure she has, tobe,
but the other us might still be in there.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.563
Oh my... just go
to the ladies'.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.567
Ladies'?

37:54.239 --> 37:56.842
- I'm confused.
- Toby: you're pissing in the ladies'.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.510
Of course
you're confused.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.612
So the other
versions of us...

38:00.646 --> 38:02.414
Have gone back in
time and become us.

38:02.448 --> 38:05.684
Well, you see,
you say that like it makes sense.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.919
To me, it's just
crazy talk.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.489
I quite like it
in the ladies'.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.491
I'm so confused.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.726
Look, pete, don't worry
about it, all right?

38:14.760 --> 38:17.496
All you need to know is that
we're back in the right time

38:17.529 --> 38:19.264
And everything is
gonna be okay.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.273
Did you get that
girl's number, ray?

38:28.306 --> 38:29.941
Oh, shit.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.610
You said
she fixed it.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.945
She said she had.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.882
Maybe she didn't expect us
to go into the ladies'.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.451
And we didn't
do that conga thing.

38:39.485 --> 38:42.821
Yeah, maybe
that wasn't vital.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.591
- Oh, fuck this, lads.
- No, pete, wait!

38:45.624 --> 38:47.826
- Oh.
- Maybe he's got the right idea.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.561
Yeah, maybe.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.063
Don't go in!

38:52.097 --> 38:55.801
Oh, thank god.

38:55.834 --> 38:59.137
It's so good to see you
again at last!

38:59.170 --> 39:00.806
What the hell
happened to you?

39:00.839 --> 39:03.675
I don't wanna
talk about it.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.777
Let's never speak
of this again.

39:05.811 --> 39:09.381
Oh, pete, have you
got shit on you?

39:09.415 --> 39:11.983
Yeah, they won't attack you
if you wear their scent.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.652
Who won't?

39:13.685 --> 39:15.821
I don't wanna
talk about it.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.222
- Uh, ray...
- Yeah?

39:17.255 --> 39:21.126
- What should we do now?
- Don't know.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.961
- Maybe we should go back to the toilets.
- Yeah.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.463
No!

39:24.496 --> 39:26.798
It's not safe.
We need weapons

39:26.832 --> 39:28.934
And food. Yeah.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.969
What the hell
did happen to you?

39:31.002 --> 39:33.171
I really don't wanna
talk about it.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.508
All i will say is
that weapons and food...

39:36.542 --> 39:39.878
Would be a really
good idea.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.148
Oh. Maybe we'll have
a little look around

39:43.181 --> 39:44.916
For weapons
and food first.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.819
Yeah. Sounds
like a plan.

40:07.272 --> 40:09.808
Ray:
what do you think happened?

40:17.583 --> 40:21.753
- You're a little bit excited, aren't you?
- A little bit.

40:21.787 --> 40:24.756
Come on, it's...
it's the future.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.357
I've always wanted
to go there.

40:26.391 --> 40:28.026
Pete:
not alone anymore.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.729
No more running, no more hiding,
no more bad dreams.

40:30.762 --> 40:34.466
You know, for someone who real
doesn't wanna talk about it,

40:34.500 --> 40:36.267
He can be quite chatty,
can't he?

40:36.301 --> 40:39.237
Weapons and food...
that's what we need!

41:14.472 --> 41:16.608
Crisp, anyone?

41:25.817 --> 41:28.053
You check the sell-By date
on those?

41:31.289 --> 41:33.792
May...

41:33.825 --> 41:36.461
2094.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.998
How do they taste?

41:40.031 --> 41:41.767
Off.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.906
So whose round is it?

41:47.939 --> 41:50.175
- Ahh...
- Ehh!

41:50.208 --> 41:52.243
Guys...

41:52.277 --> 41:53.979
I think
i've seen us.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.514
- What?
- One time i bumped into three guys

41:56.548 --> 41:59.050
Who were dressed
like this...

41:59.084 --> 42:00.819
Like we are now...

42:00.852 --> 42:03.254
...only i didn't
recognize them.

42:03.288 --> 42:05.523
Us?
In the future?

42:05.557 --> 42:07.492
Must've been.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.394
But we've only just
put these on.

42:09.427 --> 42:12.097
It's time travel...
shit like that happens.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.733
Did we look well?

42:14.766 --> 42:17.368
Yeah, i suppose so.

42:17.402 --> 42:20.471
Too busy running in the
other direction to notice.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.944
Come on, let's get back
to the toilets.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.746
Whoa whoa whoa.
What?

42:27.779 --> 42:29.447
But we've only
just got here.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.517
I think we've all got
the idea, haven't we?

42:32.550 --> 42:34.452
- Ray: hmm?
- Toby: the future's broken.

42:34.485 --> 42:38.489
But we have to have a little look around.
I mean, how can we not?

42:38.523 --> 42:41.827
- Are you serious?
- Have you actually looked out there, ray?

42:41.860 --> 42:43.929
This might just
be a bad area.

42:43.962 --> 42:47.766
In a bad area, all right, windows get put
through, kids drink on street corners.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.535
That is the end
of the fucking world.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.304
Ray, don't you
want to go home?

42:53.338 --> 42:56.007
Of course i do.
Just, you know,

42:56.041 --> 42:57.342
In a little while.

42:57.375 --> 43:00.846
The way home isn't out there.
It's in there.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.782
And i want to go home.
I really do.

43:03.815 --> 43:07.185
And every time i go in and come out,
i pray i'm gonna to be in the right time.

43:07.218 --> 43:09.888
One day i will be.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.457
Pete, exactly how long
have you been doing this?

43:12.490 --> 43:15.460
Long enough to know
it's better done in packs...

43:15.493 --> 43:17.495
That doesn't sound good.

43:17.528 --> 43:19.898
...so they can't
attack you from behind.

43:19.931 --> 43:23.034
Or that.
Let's just sit down,

43:23.068 --> 43:26.638
All right,
in the warm and wait

43:26.672 --> 43:29.340
For rescue, okay?

43:29.374 --> 43:32.010
Rescue?
No one knows we're here.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.913
At least out there,
there might be someone who can help us.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.748
- Like who?
- I don't know.

43:36.782 --> 43:39.350
Like... like...
ooh, like friendly future people

43:39.384 --> 43:41.987
- With huge heads.
- You're living in a dream world,

43:42.020 --> 43:44.389
Both of you!

43:44.422 --> 43:47.859
- I'm gonna go and get a bit of wood.
- Thanks, pete.

43:47.893 --> 43:51.096
Not for the fire.
I'm gonna turn this into a spear.

43:51.129 --> 43:55.066
When i get back, you two...
you'd better be ready to go

43:55.100 --> 43:57.268
'Cause i'm not
going alone again.

44:00.806 --> 44:03.441
- What's up with you?
- What?

44:03.474 --> 44:06.444
How many times have we talked
about seeing the future, tobe?

44:06.477 --> 44:08.513
I'm not going out there.

44:08.546 --> 44:11.649
Those look like the sort of
streets monsters run down.

44:11.683 --> 44:14.585
Besides, ray, i haven't really got
the right shoes on for the rubble.

44:16.621 --> 44:19.190
There's always something with you,
tobe, isn't it?

44:19.224 --> 44:22.160
"Oh, i couldn't send my script out;
the margins were too wide."

44:22.193 --> 44:25.596
"I couldn't go to that job interview;
there was a spot on my elbow."

44:25.630 --> 44:28.633
"I can't go exploring;
it's the end of the world."

44:28.666 --> 44:30.501
That last one's actually
quite a good one.

44:30.535 --> 44:32.804
No, it's fine.

44:32.838 --> 44:35.506
You just...
you just wait there

44:35.540 --> 44:37.876
For rescue.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.948
And you call yourself
an imagineer.

45:33.799 --> 45:37.468
Ray!

45:37.502 --> 45:41.572
- Toby!
- Pete!

45:41.606 --> 45:44.009
What's going on?
You okay?

45:49.514 --> 45:51.249
Is everything
all right out here?

45:53.484 --> 45:54.953
Oh my god.

46:08.133 --> 46:10.035
What does
it mean, ray?

46:10.068 --> 46:12.137
What does it mean?!

46:12.170 --> 46:14.405
- It's us.
- Do you think?

46:19.477 --> 46:21.947
Your woman said
you'd get famous, right?

46:21.980 --> 46:24.782
Well, maybe we all do.

46:24.816 --> 46:27.652
- What for?
- I don't know.

46:27.685 --> 46:31.022
Maybe we form a band.

46:33.324 --> 46:35.726
Can anybody
play anything?

46:37.062 --> 46:39.965
- Maybe we learn?
- And maybe it's not a band.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.970
Toby: do you think...
do you think they did it from photos

46:45.003 --> 46:46.737
Or do you think
we posed?

46:46.771 --> 46:50.375
- We're dressed as we are now.
- Yeah, that's a head fuck.

46:51.609 --> 46:53.979
Whoa!

46:55.380 --> 46:57.482
- What was that?
- What was what?

46:57.515 --> 47:00.485
- That noise.
- There was no noise.

47:00.518 --> 47:03.288
Ray: pete?

47:03.321 --> 47:05.690
Shit!
What the fuck was that?

47:07.592 --> 47:09.527
- It sounded like mandibles.
- What?

47:09.560 --> 47:12.230
- It's what insects eat with.
- I know what mandibles are.

47:12.263 --> 47:15.566
- Big insects.
- There was another sound. It was like a moaning sound.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.137
Pete: big moaning insects.
Back to the toilets.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.471
No no no,
wait wait wait.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.607
- We don't know that for sure.
- Yeah, i mean,

47:22.640 --> 47:24.442
The insects
could be... anything.

47:24.475 --> 47:27.312
Right, it could be like...
my big friendly future people,

47:27.345 --> 47:30.081
You know, with their little spindly
bodies and their huge hands.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.077
I think we got a little bit
spooked over nothing.

47:59.110 --> 48:01.846
Shh! Things can come
in here as well, you know?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.848
- Things? What kind of things?
- Shh.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.216
No no no.
I will not "shh."

48:05.250 --> 48:07.318
- You're freaking me out.
- Toby, leave him alone.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.420
No no, ray.
Look at him.

48:09.454 --> 48:11.556
He is covered in shit
and scared shitless.

48:11.589 --> 48:14.125
Don't you think it would be handy
to know what did that to him?

48:14.159 --> 48:17.495
- Aren't you just a little bit curious about...
- Pete: shh.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.867
One time
i came in here,

48:22.900 --> 48:25.036
I went out
through that door,

48:25.070 --> 48:27.372
And i fell.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.874
Must've been when the ground
level was different...

48:29.907 --> 48:31.742
40 feet different.

48:31.776 --> 48:33.678
I landed in a wood.

48:33.711 --> 48:36.014
I couldn't tell you
what time i was in.

48:36.047 --> 48:38.183
If it was the past,
then our fossil records

48:38.216 --> 48:39.917
Are pretty fucking far
from complete.

48:39.951 --> 48:42.320
But i wasn't
the first to fall.

48:42.353 --> 48:46.257
- You met other people?
- I didn't say they were alive.

48:48.293 --> 48:50.295
There were things
in that wood...

48:50.328 --> 48:52.830
They only came out
at night...

48:52.863 --> 48:55.500
The breathing...

48:55.533 --> 48:57.668
The noises...

48:57.702 --> 48:59.971
The screams.

49:00.005 --> 49:02.007
Whoa!

49:02.040 --> 49:03.774
Ray: pack it in.

49:03.808 --> 49:06.011
Toby: hello, petey.
Change your mind?

49:06.044 --> 49:08.446
Pete: shit shit shit.
What the fuck are you doing?

49:08.479 --> 49:11.216
If you've got anything planned,
you're gonna get it too.

49:11.249 --> 49:13.718
It's us.

49:13.751 --> 49:16.854
Pete: i haven't got anything planned.
Will you let me out, please?

49:16.887 --> 49:20.191
- We can warn ourselves.
- No no no, if we do that, then we cease to exist.

49:20.225 --> 49:21.792
- Oh shit.
- Exactly.

49:29.734 --> 49:31.769
Toby:
ray, check the loos.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.439
- Ray: what?
- Toby: probably got some bloke in a "scream" mask.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.941
Not a fucking sound.

49:38.143 --> 49:40.078
Ooh, it really does
stink in here.

49:40.111 --> 49:42.247
Toby:
you might as well just pay me now.

49:44.549 --> 49:47.985
It's like
a dungy zooey...

49:48.019 --> 49:50.355
- It's pete's bullshit you can smell.
- Listen!

49:50.388 --> 49:52.790
Pete:
this isn't a wind-Up.

49:52.823 --> 49:56.927
- Do you really want to see the future?
- Toby: i'd love to.

49:56.961 --> 49:59.597
Pete:
then we've got to do exactly what i did.

49:59.630 --> 50:02.500
Ray:
what do you mean?

50:02.533 --> 50:04.869
Pete:
*...i can say

50:04.902 --> 50:08.606
* a total eclipse
of the heart... *

50:19.817 --> 50:22.120
Gone.

50:22.153 --> 50:25.456
Oh, that's just great.
That's so fucking great!

50:25.490 --> 50:28.025
I could have saved myself...
saved us.

50:28.059 --> 50:30.428
Pete, we'll
cease to exist.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.330
Yeah, well,
i don't care.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.732
And if i get the chance
to warn myself again,

50:34.765 --> 50:37.668
I'm gonna do it and the hell with
anyone who tries to stop me.

50:37.702 --> 50:39.570
Shit.

50:40.705 --> 50:43.074
I was wondering when
that was gonna happen.

50:43.108 --> 50:44.509
- Wait!
- Pete, no!

50:45.510 --> 50:47.478
- Pete, no!
- Pete!

50:53.718 --> 50:56.321
- What is this?
- Okay, ray, keep it together. Keep it together.

50:56.354 --> 50:58.356
What would miss marple do?
What would miss marple do?

50:58.389 --> 51:00.191
Toby:
there's hundreds of us.

51:00.225 --> 51:02.026
How can there be
hundreds of us?

51:02.059 --> 51:05.463
Did pete touch himself? Is this what
happens when you do a big paradox, hmmm?

51:05.496 --> 51:08.666
They aren't us, tobe.
They're only dressed like us.

51:08.699 --> 51:12.036
Oh, well, that's all right then.
Now it makes complete sense.

51:12.069 --> 51:15.039
Ray: okay,
what we need to do now is find pete

51:15.072 --> 51:16.841
And get the hell
out of here.

51:16.874 --> 51:18.409
* not for all
the tea in china *

51:18.443 --> 51:20.878
* or the corn
in carolina *

51:20.911 --> 51:26.016
* never never ever

51:26.050 --> 51:29.354
* they're running
after you, babe *

51:29.387 --> 51:32.690
* run for the sun,
little one *

51:32.723 --> 51:37.027
* you're an outlaw
once again, time to change *

51:37.061 --> 51:42.933
* superman will be
with us while he can *

51:42.967 --> 51:48.473
* in the land
of make believe... *

51:54.111 --> 51:55.780
Tobe,

51:55.813 --> 51:57.948
I think i know why
everyone is dressed like us.

51:57.982 --> 52:00.351
- Why?
- It's a theme night...

52:00.385 --> 52:03.588
A fan theme night
based around us.

52:03.621 --> 52:06.624
Come on. It's a bit
of a stretch, isn't it?

52:06.657 --> 52:09.960
- What makes you think that?
- Big sign just over there.

52:12.830 --> 52:16.133
Fans... of us.

52:17.235 --> 52:18.869
- Do you think we're here?
- What?

52:18.903 --> 52:21.071
The famous future us.

52:21.105 --> 52:22.907
Oh my god, i hope not.

52:26.777 --> 52:28.879
Yes, it is me.

52:28.913 --> 52:31.015
Hello.

52:31.048 --> 52:33.284
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out, ray.

52:33.318 --> 52:36.387
- These are my people.
- No, they're not. And this isn't even our time.

52:36.421 --> 52:39.657
Can't we just soak up
a bit of the love?

52:39.690 --> 52:41.559
No, we can't.

52:41.592 --> 52:43.828
Now this is what
i call a future.

52:43.861 --> 52:45.563
Well, tough,

52:45.596 --> 52:49.033
Because we are just here to find
pete and get the hell out of here,

52:49.066 --> 52:51.269
So now you just stay
where i can see you.

52:57.842 --> 52:59.910
Guys, is it the real you?

52:59.944 --> 53:02.146
- It's the real us.
- Oh!

53:02.179 --> 53:05.250
- Did you touch yourself?
- No.

53:05.283 --> 53:07.818
But i think
i've broken time.

53:07.852 --> 53:11.088
- The whole world's full of us.
- You haven't broken time, you knob head.

53:11.121 --> 53:13.391
Yes, pete, what you did
was very very dangerous.

53:13.424 --> 53:16.327
And i want you to promise me
that you'll never do it again.

53:16.361 --> 53:19.430
- No.
- What's that?

53:19.464 --> 53:22.433
Someone slapped it on me.

53:22.467 --> 53:24.469
He's won the pete
lookalike competition.

53:24.502 --> 53:26.404
Well, he does look
a lot like him.

53:26.437 --> 53:29.006
You do.
I wonder if they did one for me.

53:36.481 --> 53:38.816
Okay, let's go.

53:38.849 --> 53:40.885
- Uh, guys?
- What?

53:40.918 --> 53:42.152
Look.

53:44.088 --> 53:45.756
Oh.

53:45.790 --> 53:47.858
Toby:
look at the table.

53:47.892 --> 53:49.660
I'm writing.

53:49.694 --> 53:52.730
I'm jesus
and i'm writing.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.668
It's that letter thing
to hollywood.

53:57.702 --> 53:59.337
This isn't my fault
as well, is it?

53:59.370 --> 54:02.773
- When i broke time?
- This is probably something else, pete.

54:02.807 --> 54:05.476
Are you sure
it's that letter?

54:05.510 --> 54:08.446
It's blank
in the painting, but...

54:08.479 --> 54:11.316
I left it on that table.
It has to be that.

54:11.349 --> 54:14.952
Oh, so someone does a painting of
us because we slag off some films?

54:14.985 --> 54:17.288
Of course it sounds stupid
if you put it like that.

54:17.322 --> 54:20.190
You ripped that page out
of your little book, right?

54:20.224 --> 54:21.892
Yeah, and?

54:21.926 --> 54:23.694
Was there anything
on the back?

54:25.496 --> 54:28.299
- Might've been.
- Might've been?

54:28.333 --> 54:30.568
Shut up.
I'm just trying to think.

54:30.601 --> 54:34.572
You know,
every time i come up with a genius idea

54:34.605 --> 54:37.342
Or one of you two says something stupid,
i put it in there.

54:37.375 --> 54:40.177
God, could be anything.

54:40.210 --> 54:42.447
It doesn't matter
what it is, does it?

54:42.480 --> 54:46.551
- What do you mean?
- You don't do paintings of nobodies.

54:46.584 --> 54:48.986
Whatever i wrote,
it turns us into somebodies.

54:49.019 --> 54:53.157
I think it's safe to say we
are rich and we are famous.

54:53.190 --> 54:55.225
Then why aren't
we smiling?

54:55.259 --> 54:58.529
I don't know,
maybe the artist wasn't very good at teeth.

54:58.563 --> 55:02.600
- Maybe it's a memorial.
- Oh, drop it with the bodies.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.869
- His woman said she fixed it.
- Oh, yeah.

55:04.902 --> 55:08.105
She said she'd fixed the time leak and i
end up getting chased about by monsters.

55:08.138 --> 55:11.308
If cassie said that we're safe,
then we are safe.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.544
- I trust her.
- Are you sure?

55:13.578 --> 55:16.013
Yes, i'm sure.

55:16.046 --> 55:19.884
- Let's go.
- Whoa, slow down!

55:19.917 --> 55:21.852
- Let me finish this drink.
- What?

55:21.886 --> 55:24.989
- Where did you get that?
- Some waiter guy.

55:25.022 --> 55:28.593
- It's free bar.
- Would you like to stock up on the buffet while we're here?

55:28.626 --> 55:31.161
- There's a buffet?!
- Oh.

55:31.195 --> 55:34.298
Hey, guys,
the cavalry's here.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.266
- Cassie says hello.
- You know cassie?

55:36.300 --> 55:38.836
I trained her.
Sergeant porter, causal adjust,

55:38.869 --> 55:41.372
But you can
call me millie. Hi.

55:41.406 --> 55:43.708
I'm here to get you home.

55:43.741 --> 55:47.344
- Hello, millie.
- Hi. We have been looking for you guys everywhere.

55:47.378 --> 55:49.480
Us, what...
are we safe?

55:49.514 --> 55:52.983
- We don't get killed?
- Uh, well, officially, i can't comment.

55:53.017 --> 55:55.285
But unofficially,
everything is sorted.

55:55.319 --> 55:56.654
Oh!

55:58.022 --> 56:00.290
But i still get
rich and famous, right?

56:00.324 --> 56:03.694
Officially, i cannot comment,
but unofficially you get your own island.

56:03.728 --> 56:05.796
Yes!

56:05.830 --> 56:07.898
Okay, so how the hell
do we get out of here?

56:07.932 --> 56:09.767
Okay, well, you just
leave that to me.

56:09.800 --> 56:10.801
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:10.835 --> 56:12.703
Come on, boys.

56:12.737 --> 56:14.171
Okay, a little bit weird,

56:14.204 --> 56:16.373
But it turns out everybody
in the future...

56:16.407 --> 56:17.908
American.

56:19.677 --> 56:21.211
Come on.

56:28.218 --> 56:31.922
I thought she was going to do something more
than tell us to get back into the bogs.

56:31.956 --> 56:33.290
Yeah, me too.

56:33.323 --> 56:35.726
So are we back?

56:42.399 --> 56:43.968
We're back.

56:44.001 --> 56:47.672
Yeah, but at what time
of night exactly?

56:53.410 --> 56:55.846
- Pfft!
- We can't slag off sequels.

56:55.880 --> 56:58.248
You know?
There have been some really good sequels.

56:58.282 --> 57:01.185
- Like?
- Like, uh...

57:01.218 --> 57:03.954
"Mad max 2,"
"godfather ii."

57:03.988 --> 57:07.157
Ray: yeah,
but for every good one there are 10...

57:07.191 --> 57:09.126
I wish they'd just
hurry up and bugger off.

57:09.159 --> 57:11.328
Yeah, it's gonna be
another little while yet.

57:11.361 --> 57:13.898
Look at us...
not a care in the world.

57:13.931 --> 57:16.967
They have no idea
what's in store.

57:17.001 --> 57:20.538
Ray:
yeah, we look so happy.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.976
Okay, ladies, um...

57:26.010 --> 57:27.812
We know they stay there
for awhile.

57:27.845 --> 57:29.346
I think
it's worth the risk.

57:29.379 --> 57:30.981
There you go, mates.

57:32.783 --> 57:35.119
Gonna get
some peanuts.

57:35.152 --> 57:37.021
Pete:
we didn't shake hands.

57:37.054 --> 57:41.258
- What, are you 12?
- Look, i swear to you... i saw myself right here.

57:43.528 --> 57:45.830
Huh?
Where are my crisps?

57:45.863 --> 57:49.266
- I'm starving.
- The bar was a little busy.

57:49.299 --> 57:50.568
Maybe later.

57:52.269 --> 57:54.238
Toby:
well, get my money ready.

57:54.271 --> 57:56.206
Ray:
are we gonna go in?

57:56.240 --> 57:58.743
Oh, brilliant.

57:58.776 --> 58:00.444
Toby:
am i really that fat?

58:00.477 --> 58:03.548
They say that time travel
adds 20 lbs.

58:03.581 --> 58:05.616
And you've
traveled a lot.

58:07.752 --> 58:10.220
- Are those two dead?
- What?

58:10.254 --> 58:12.523
What do you mean?

58:12.557 --> 58:14.825
Are those two dead?

58:14.859 --> 58:17.762
Oh, no, not yet.

58:17.795 --> 58:19.163
Finally.

58:27.938 --> 58:30.074
Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah!

58:30.107 --> 58:33.177
Are we ready, children?

58:33.210 --> 58:35.012
- Come on.
- Get on with it.

58:40.017 --> 58:42.186
Well, i never!

58:42.219 --> 58:45.623
- It's nuts.
- I never would have thought it was that.

58:49.326 --> 58:52.496
So do we just
leave it here?

58:52.529 --> 58:55.600
Yeah. Yeah, i assume
someone just finds it

58:55.633 --> 58:57.635
And it all goes
from here.

58:59.003 --> 59:02.039
I think... i think
i feel good about it.

59:04.474 --> 59:08.512
Do you feel good about it, tobe?
It was my idea.

59:08.545 --> 59:11.181
- My idea.
- Our idea.

59:11.215 --> 59:14.318
You might've come up with the seed,
but i watered it.

59:14.351 --> 59:16.887
Yes, but without our seed

59:16.921 --> 59:18.989
- You have nothing.
- Pete: yeah.

59:19.023 --> 59:22.893
- You've got mud.
- All right, well, you can have a little bit of my island.

59:22.927 --> 59:25.362
Screw that.
I don't want to live on your island.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.532
- It's fine by me.
- I need a piss.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.636
Yes, i'll go outside.

59:31.669 --> 59:35.005
- Don't touch yourself.
- Oh ho.

59:35.039 --> 59:37.407
Yeah, good times.

59:38.676 --> 59:41.145
I want my own island.

59:52.957 --> 59:55.793
Cassie:
ahem. Hi!

59:55.826 --> 59:58.362
Hi!

59:58.395 --> 01:00:00.898
I was hoping
you'd come back...

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:03.734
Obviously not
at that precise moment.

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:06.070
But, um, hey.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:14.144
So how long has it been for
you since we were last...

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.880
Oh, another
six months.

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:18.348
- I got a promotion.
- Oh.

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:20.851
This time
it's for real.

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:24.221
Yeah, it was for
sorting all this out.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:26.323
So...

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.859
You want to ask me if i read
the whole manual, don't you?

01:00:28.893 --> 01:00:30.895
Thought never even
crossed my mind.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:34.231
Well, ray, i am
rewriting the manual.

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.400
Good for you.

01:00:37.768 --> 01:00:40.771
So, um, you have
a nice night tonight?

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:45.109
Well, you know, just a quiet
drink with the boys in the pub...

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:49.213
Very dull. I did meet
this one girl, though.

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:51.381
- Really?
- She said she was from the future.

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:53.818
What was she like?

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:56.120
She was just...

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:00.691
- Awful.
- Oh!

01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:03.060
Oh no, she was great.
She was great.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.898
You know, i never
thought i'd say it,

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:09.800
But it's good to be back
in the present.

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:11.902
I don't know.

01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:14.404
All this fuss
over half an hour?

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:16.606
What? What are you
talking about?

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.675
We went years into the future...
decades.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.510
Oh, that's very funny.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:23.313
Cassie,
i'm deadly serious.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:25.582
We went into the ladies'
through another time leak

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.617
And it brought us to this pub
but in the future...

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:30.187
Way into the future.
You were searching for us...

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.823
Millie and you and all your lot...
causal adjust.

01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:36.293
Ray, causal adjust is just
another name for the editors.

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.495
- The who?
- I told you about them.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.966
They kill people at their finest hour.
Millie's an editor, ray.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:43.667
Oh, shit.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.470
She brought us back here.
She brought us here... why would she do that?

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:48.672
Why do you think?
To kill you.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.675
Oh no.
What do we do?

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:56.113
Okay, well, i'm going to go get
help and you just stay put.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:59.049
- I've got to go and warn the boys.
- Ray, it's not safe in there.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:01.518
I can't just leave them, cassie.
Look, you bring help

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.253
And i'll...

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:04.688
I'll do what i can.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.291
Ray!

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:09.860
Please be careful.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.636
Whoa!
Watch it, dude.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:22.006
- Guys, we're screwed.
- What?

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:24.508
- Millie is an editor.
- A what?

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:26.543
An editor.
Remember, they kill people

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.313
At their finest hour?
Like... like kevin costner.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:31.681
And i think that this...
this was ours.

01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:33.350
Oh, let's get
out of here.

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:37.754
No no no no no, wait wait wait.
There's no point.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:40.958
There's no point. They'll only find
us some other time, some other place.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:42.126
What do we do, ray?

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:44.694
That's odd.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:46.230
I can't get a signal.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.565
- We burn this.
- What?

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:51.568
We burn this, we change history.
Without this they have no reason to kill us.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.170
You don't know for sure
we're in danger.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:55.572
- Cassie said.
- I don't care what she said.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.741
Tobe, i saw this place
full of bodies.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.210
Look, ray,
just think about what you're throwing away.

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:02.046
If you burn that,
we don't get rich.

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:04.181
- We don't get famous.
- We don't get dead.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:06.616
Look, i've come up
with a lot of ideas...

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:08.418
- A lot of shit ideas.
- Tobe...

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:11.155
And i know you laugh at them,
but i don't mind because i thought,

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:13.223
You know,
if i keep going,

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.425
One day i'd come up
with something good.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:18.495
Well, what if this is it?
The one idea that makes it for me?

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:21.598
My one chance.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.868
Don't burn it, ray.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.936
It's not even your idea.
I say we burn it.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:28.038
You fucking would!
You've always hated my ideas.

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:30.107
Pete: are you even listening?
It's not even your idea!

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.843
Guys! Okay, guys,
we don't have time for this, right?

01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:34.778
Just... pete, give me
the lighter.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.948
- Toby, don't...!
- You give it to me!

01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:39.416
Toby, you...

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.322
Pete, what's up with this?

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.324
Two months in a wood
trying to stay alive...

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:49.026
That's what's up
with the lighter.

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:52.662
Come here. Okay, you keep trying.
I'm gonna get some matches.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:57.567
- Give me a go.
- No.

01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:59.136
I'll be fine,
just give me a go.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.871
Excuse me.
Ahem.

01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:03.640
- Hi.
- Hey, what's happening?

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.010
We're on our own.
I'm offline.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:08.778
- What do you mean?
- My time machine inside me... it's blocked.

01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:10.380
- Give me the lighter.
- No.

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:11.882
- Just give it to me.
- No way.

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:14.551
Give me the fucking
letter, pete.

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:17.554
- Not a chance.
- And so you deny me three times.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.990
That's why you were in the painting.
You're judas.

01:04:20.024 --> 01:04:22.192
- It's peter, you moron!
- Excuse me,

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:24.661
- All i want is a box of matches!
- Yeah, all right.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:28.632
- What's your point?
- In the bible, it was peter who denied jesus

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:32.302
Three times,
you fat twat.

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:34.404
Hey, that's enough, lads!

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:35.940
Time at the bar!

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:37.975
Get off me,
you bell-End.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:46.984
This is it.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.191
Hi.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:58.495
I have seen the original
before, of course,

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:01.065
But in a museum.
So just to be here

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:03.767
Tonight with the creators
on the night it all began...

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.137
Is just such a rush.

01:05:07.171 --> 01:05:09.439
But i am sorry
to say tonight

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.475
Is as good as it gets.

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:14.778
You don't change or add to
culture in any meaningful way.

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:17.647
This is what you're always
going to be remembered for.

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:21.685
So why not go out with a bang
rather than fade away?

01:05:21.718 --> 01:05:24.521
Get away from him,
ye bitch!

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.391
Hello. I'm sorry.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.994
I'm pointing
a rather large gun at you.

01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:33.663
Uh, yeah.
Which you got from when exactly?

01:05:33.697 --> 01:05:35.865
Centuries beyond your time.

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:37.601
So what is it?

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:40.404
What is it?

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.376
I'll tell... ahem...
i'll tell you what it is.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:49.746
It's a mark iv carbomite
assault staff...

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:52.049
The planetary peace corps's
best friend.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:55.352
It'll work in an absolute
vacuum and at absolute zero.

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:57.687
Cold-Fusion battery...
good for 50 years.

01:05:57.721 --> 01:05:59.323
It fires
homing plasma orbs

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:02.392
That'll cut through
titanium plate 4" thick.

01:06:02.426 --> 01:06:04.461
Really?

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.096
Well...

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:08.698
You didn't, like,
mention its range.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.435
I'd hit you from here.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:15.739
Now get off the big guy.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:25.815
Millie, i know what
you're trying to do.

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:28.985
The future generations leading from
this room that wouldn't be born...

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:32.122
Chaos theory
on a massive scale.

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:36.726
Ray:
cassie? Cassie!

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.963
Right, that's it!
I'm calling the police.

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:44.968
Oh, stop it.
Fucking stop it.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.670
Everybody freeze!

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:49.039
Ain't nobody
going nowhere.

01:06:49.073 --> 01:06:50.940
Hey, drop
your weapons.

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:53.043
You see
any weapons, ray?

01:06:53.077 --> 01:06:57.381
See, my time machine has
a built-In armament system.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:58.948
So to "drop my weapons"

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:00.850
Would require about...

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:03.553
Yeah, 12 hours
of surgery.

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:05.422
You know what?

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.592
I think we're gonna have a
little stand-Off here today.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:11.061
Oh...

01:07:11.095 --> 01:07:13.263
Unless of course
you're bluffing.

01:07:13.297 --> 01:07:15.399
Unless, of course,
that is

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:18.735
A plastic toy gun
you made for work, ray.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.672
Oh, poo.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.346
That's a nice try.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:32.582
I messed up, ray.
I'm sorry.

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:34.484
No no,
don't worry about it.

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:36.720
All in all it's been
a pretty good day.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:38.722
You know, i traveled
through time, met you.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:41.258
Know what?

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:43.860
I am sensing
a little bit of resistance

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.895
To this whole
immortality deal

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:47.897
I am offering here.

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:52.068
Toby, all you have to do

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.571
Is destroy that
little piece of paper

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:56.506
And you get to live
to write another day

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.041
In your book
of bad ideas

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.344
And your
dead-End job.

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:02.146
Wow.

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:04.681
Or you could
give it to me

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:07.351
And i'll turn you
all into legends.

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:08.752
What do you say?

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:14.023
Come on, tobe.

01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:17.894
I-I just... i just need
a little time to think.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.529
What is there
to think about?

01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:21.365
She's gonna
fucking kill us.

01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.433
It's not that simple.

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:30.407
Ah ah ah ah ah!

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.176
Now this is his choice
and his alone.

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:40.384
Oh no, the song!

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.085
This fucking song!

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:45.221
You know, if there was one thing i
could change about this situation,

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:48.524
It would not be the song
on the fucking jukebox!

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:50.227
Time's up!

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.430
Now what's it gonna be?

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:14.251
Millie: toby?

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:25.194
Fuck you.
Chuck it!

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:35.439
No!

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:59.863
* running...
running... running *

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:03.800
* keep on running

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:07.271
* they're running
after you, babe *

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:10.307
* run for the sun,
little one... *

01:10:52.516 --> 01:10:58.922
* in the land
of make believe *

01:11:12.536 --> 01:11:14.338
* run for the sun,
little one... *

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:20.377
* you're an outlaw
once again, time to change *

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:26.483
* superman will be
with us while he can *

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:31.120
* in the land
of make believe... *

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:40.356
Whoo, wow.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:42.759
Janey mac.

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:46.663
Oh...

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:55.605
- Did you do that?
- Yep.

01:12:55.639 --> 01:12:58.007
With my pint?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.876
We were just dead.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:02.045
- Yeah.
- But...

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:04.213
- But now we're not.
- No.

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:07.083
So what...
what happened exactly?

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:10.153
- I knocked a pint onto this...
- My pint. My pint.

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:13.957
I knocked pete's pint
onto this,

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:17.193
Um, so no one could read it.
So the future

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.663
Then changed because
we didn't become famous,

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:21.998
So the editors didn't
send anybody to kill us.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:25.068
Wow.

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.504
I think
you got that wrong.

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:30.440
- What?
- Well, pete downed his pint, didn't he?

01:13:30.474 --> 01:13:34.110
So that was
probably my pint.

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:39.348
Jesus, could we focus on
the us-Being-Alive-Again thing?

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:42.251
Well yeah, you know, obviously.
Well done, ray.

01:13:42.285 --> 01:13:45.221
Is that it?
Is it all over?

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.923
We're all okay?

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:48.625
Yeah, i think so.

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:51.661
Wow.

01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:54.130
I've gone off this pub
a little bit.

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:56.666
- Should we go down to the king's head?
- Why not?

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.035
So... so everything
that happened tonight...

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.304
Couldn't happen,
didn't happen.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:05.174
Including me
meeting cassie.

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:08.878
Tsk. Oh.

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:12.482
- Yeah. Come on, let's go.
- Ray: right.

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:19.723
I swear i will never
use a pub toilet again.

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.390
It's too dangerous.

01:14:21.424 --> 01:14:23.793
And that's all you're taking
away from this evening?

01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:26.062
- No!
- So we're definitely safe now, yeah?

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:27.564
- I suppose.
- Suppose?!

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:30.033
You're the nerds.
Can't you work it out?

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:32.736
Well, yeah, you know?
Time reset, so the pub

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:35.271
Was never full
of dead people.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.073
So you owe me a tenner.
Come on!

01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:40.744
Okay then, if time reset,
the bet never happened.

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:55.659
Well, i did
only say "suppose."

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:03.466
- It's cassie!
- Ray!

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.401
Oh, thank god
you're alive!

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:15.311
- Ha.
- Oh.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.548
- So you remember me then?
- Of course i remember you.

01:15:18.582 --> 01:15:20.717
We've been going out
for two years.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:22.385
We've... what?!
Really?

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:23.753
- Yeah. Yes.
- Two years?

01:15:23.787 --> 01:15:25.689
That's... wow.
Um...

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:28.157
Oh, uh...

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.293
Right, this is
pete and tobe.

01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:32.161
- Hiya.
- Hello.

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:36.332
This is cassie.
She's my girlfriend.

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:39.703
Ray, listen, when you
knocked that pint over,

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:42.505
You created a feedback loop
through the fabric of space-Time.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.908
The repercussions have been enormous...
leaks everywhere.

01:15:44.941 --> 01:15:47.844
Whoa.
Two years, huh?

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:51.447
Wow.
So we must have, uh...

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.617
Have we had
any of the...

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:57.053
- Mmm?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:00.990
Unless of course you
mean sex, which, yeah.

01:16:01.024 --> 01:16:02.525
Yes, yeah,
we've done that lots.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.427
Lots.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.599
- Was i any good?
- Ray!

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:12.135
I love you, but we only have
14 hours to save the earth.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.203
So you have to
come with me now!

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:16.706
- Okay.
- Yeah, good luck with that, guys!

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.942
Yeah, we'll be
in the king's head.

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:21.044
What? You guys
have to come too!

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:23.713
I think i've done enough time
travel for one night, thanks.

01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:26.582
It's not time travel.
It's a parallel universe!

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:29.352
- Parallel universe?
- Let's go, the portal's closing!

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:32.055
- What the fuck's a portal?
- Come on!

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.991
Look, why don't
you two go?

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:38.027
Because someone should stay and
look after the coats and the bags.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:40.730
Besides, i thought i might go
for your job on the star ride.

01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:42.598
I was gonna
apply for that!

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:45.368
- Toby: i said it first.
- Guys, guys, listen to yourselves.

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:48.504
Look, this is our one chance
to do something important.

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.974
Yeah, we might
fuck it up.

01:16:51.007 --> 01:16:53.242
To be honest,
we probably will.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:57.046
Okay, we definitely will.
But...

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.949
Who's with me?

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.151
Please?

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:09.558
As long as we're back
for last orders.

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.662
There's my imagineers.

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:19.402
Okay, let's do this.

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:23.406
One...

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:26.042
- Two...
- I fucking hate sci-Fi.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:28.244
"Science fiction"...
three!

01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:36.419
* it's the final
countdown *

01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:44.861
* the final countdown

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:54.237
* we're leaving together

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:58.374
* but still it's farewell

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:02.145
* and maybe
we'll come back *

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:05.581
* to earth,
who can tell? *

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.852
Have we gone?

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:11.220
I suppose.

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:14.190
All right. Come on, toby.
It's over.

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:21.430
Bollocks.

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:26.035
* it's the final
countdown *

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:33.709
* the final countdown

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:50.693
* we're heading
for venus *

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:55.498
* and still
we stand tall *

01:18:55.531 --> 01:18:58.835
* 'cause maybe
they've seen us *

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:03.372
* and welcome us all,
yeah *

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:06.976
* with so many
light years to go *

01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:11.815
- * and things to be found
- * things to be found

01:19:11.848 --> 01:19:15.684
* i'm sure that
we'll all miss her so *

01:19:16.953 --> 01:19:21.057
* it's the final countdown

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:28.998
* the final countdown

01:20:20.016 --> 01:20:27.857
* it's the final countdown

01:20:27.891 --> 01:20:31.995
* it's the final
countdown *

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:40.103
* the final countdown

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:47.810
* the final countdown.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:23.806
Get back, freak!

01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:26.542
Help me!

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:34.017
Toby, wait!

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:37.053
Don't be frightened,
it's me... toby!

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:40.123
This is all getting a
little bit too complicated.
