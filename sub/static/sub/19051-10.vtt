Charlie, what is so hard to

01:06.280 --> 01:09.329
I believe that if I
inseminated the right woman,

If you were driving around

01:43.360 --> 01:46.256
then that is completely irresponsible,
and you need to pay for the damages.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.045
- [ Dee ] Yeah.
- None of the damages were my fault.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.202

That being said, Frank
would be the defendant.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.289

that implies that I am guilty.

accused of anything,

while operating a car is-

05:55.120 --> 05:57.885

It's moronic.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.008
One might even call it...
donkey-brained.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.809
Donkey-brained?

06:03.880 --> 06:07.362
It means to have the
brains of a donkey...

06:07.440 --> 06:10.842
or a donkey-type
creature.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.241
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I
know what it means, guy.

06:13.320 --> 06:17.086
But if anything, it's not donkey-brained
to drive around with a bowl of cereal.

06:17.160 --> 06:21.529
It's donkey-brained to drive around
without the use of your vision.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.491
Oh. That's interesting. So you do admit
that someone who makes foolish decisions...

06:25.560 --> 06:27.801
could be considered
donkey-brained?

06:27.880 --> 06:30.565
Uh-Sure.
Yeah, okay, fine.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.007
<i>I'll</i> take it.
All right.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.727
Now, Frank, if I'm correct,
when you were a boy,

06:36.800 --> 06:40.566
you were admitted into a...
mental institution.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.246
- Is this correct?
- That's correct.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.211
But soon after, it was discovered
that I wasn't mentally disabled,

06:47.280 --> 06:48.770
so they let me go.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.765
And they let me go
with the proper paperwork,

06:52.840 --> 06:54.604
clearing me of everything.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.445
I would like to add
into evidence Article 1.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.928
Uh, Mac, will you please
read this document?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.050
Mm-hmm. “By the power of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,

07:15.687 --> 07:16.489

07:16.560 --> 07:18.296
Well, it's written
right here in plain English.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.136
Frank, would you like to
clear this up for everybody?

07:20.160 --> 07:24.882
Well, all the kids in the
neighborhood knew I got sent upstate,

07:24.960 --> 07:28.681
so they started calling me “Frankie Donkey
Brains,” and it was very traumatic.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.565
So I got my mommy to drive
me back up to the loony bin,

07:31.680 --> 07:35.082
where they signed
this official certificate...

07:35.160 --> 07:37.970
exonerating me
of all donkey brains.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.168
Yeah, great. what does this
have to do with anything?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.447
Well, Dennis,
if by your own admission,

07:42.520 --> 07:45.251
someone who has donkey brains
could be considered...

07:45.360 --> 07:47.931
reckless or moronic or idiotic,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.800
and my client Frank here has a
state-issued certificate...

07:51.880 --> 07:54.486
clearing him of having
said donkey brains,

07:54.560 --> 07:56.403
then I ask you this-

07:58.000 --> 08:01.686
Do you have
any such certificate?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.091
What?

08:03.160 --> 08:07.006
Well, we don't want a donkey
on the road eating cereal.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.004
We know Frank's not a donkey.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.562
How do we know you're not
a donkey-brained man?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.844
Why would I have a certificate?

08:16.920 --> 08:19.082
You don't have a certificate?

08:19.160 --> 08:21.162
N-N-No. The burden of
proof is not on me.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.924
The defendant will
answer the question.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.765
- The defendant? I'm not the defendant!
- Just answer the question.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.683
- No.
- No further questions.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.047
- Oh!
- You gotta be kidding me. Because of that?

08:33.120 --> 08:35.600
You don't have a certificate.
What else are we supposed to-

08:35.679 --> 08:38.570
- What in the... You may have
donkey brains. I don't know.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.530
No one can prove that they're not
donkey-brained except for him.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.364
I just-I wish you
had a certificate.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.010
Oh, bullshit!

08:50.560 --> 08:55.248
- Frank, would you like a glass of wine?
- Yeah, all right.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.210
Huh? Why not have a glass of wine?
I mean, after all-

08:59.640 --> 09:01.085
Uh!

09:01.160 --> 09:03.561
- Hey! Hey! You can't do that!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:03.640 --> 09:07.725
Oh, whoopsie, whoopsie. See, I bashed
into Frank while he was at a dead stop.

09:07.800 --> 09:12.681
That's completely my fault, Frank. I will
pay for all the damages to your shirt.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.728
Case closed.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.246
Oh. Well, when you put it
like that, you got me.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.846
You know, I'm on Dennis's side now.
He just convinced me.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.651
Uh, hold-hold on
one second though, Charlie.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.681
It occurs to me that Frank assumed
responsibility for a potential spill...

09:27.760 --> 09:29.250
the second he took the wine.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.209
He's right.
I knew the risk.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.001
So in this circumstance, it would
appear that Frank is at fault.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.048
And therefore, in the car,
Dennis is at fault.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.248
I am on Frank's side.
Case closed.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.481
I pushed-I pushed him!

09:40.680 --> 09:44.002
Boom! You nailed it. You know what? Mac just
made the most credible argument of all.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.242
Hold on a second! Hold on, Charlie.
Credibility?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.845
You're interested
in credibility?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.844
I would like to call
my next witness-Mac.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.681
So, Mac, you seem
to be pretty locked...

09:58.760 --> 10:00.364
into Frank's side at this point.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.444
Right? And your opinion, it carries a
lot of weight around here, doesn't it?

10:03.520 --> 10:07.127
Oh, absolutely. I'm a taste maker around
here. Pretty much what I say goes.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.806
And I've decided that
Frank is the winner.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.665
Yeah. And, Charlie, you
find Mac's arguments

10:12.677 --> 10:15.006
to be fairly credible
and convincing?

10:15.080 --> 10:17.560
I do. Yeah. He makes a
lot of good points.

10:17.640 --> 10:21.087
He's a good judge, and-
He's an even better bailiff.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.130
So if you find Mac's
arguments to be so credible,

10:24.200 --> 10:27.283
why is it that you disagree on
the subject of super humans?

10:27.360 --> 10:28.691
Well, we don't-

10:29.800 --> 10:31.882
What? What does this have
to do with the case?

10:31.960 --> 10:34.964
Well, Mac, if your character isn't
credible, then are your arguments?

10:35.040 --> 10:39.648
[ Sighs ] Strike this line of
questioning from the record, please.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.768
Uh, overruled.
Let her continue.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.650
Mao, do you or do you not believe
that you could create...

10:44.720 --> 10:49.089
a superhuman race of strongmen through
genetic mutation and evolution?

10:49.160 --> 10:50.730
What difference does that make?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.643
If you believe something
that insane,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.370
then how could you be
our taste maker?

10:54.440 --> 10:56.416
How could we believe anything
that you have to say?

10:56.440 --> 10:58.169
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.767
Do you or do you not believe
that you can create...

11:01.840 --> 11:06.926
a superhuman race of strongmen through
genetic mutation and evolution?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.845
Uh, no. [ Chuckles ]
That's ridiculous, Dee.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.844
- What are you talking about? - what
are you talking about? You were just-

11:17.920 --> 11:19.976
You were just telling Charlie
this morning all about the-

11:20.000 --> 11:22.480
“Have you seen X-Men?”
and “my seed” and-

11:22.560 --> 11:25.616
No, I was joking with Charlie. That could
never happen in the real world, Dee.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.536
- That's, like, a comic book thing.
- He's credible.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.564
Yeah. He's credible. All right, we
won this case. I win this case.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.696
It's an open-and-shut case. [
Dee ] Shit, Dennis, that was-

11:32.720 --> 11:35.041
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.841
- Mac, why don't you believe that?
- Huh?

11:38.920 --> 11:40.776
Well, I'm just wondering
why don't you believe...

11:40.800 --> 11:46.603
that you could pass down a gene that would
eventually evolve into a race of super men?

11:46.680 --> 11:49.524
- Why? - [ Scoffs ]
That's a silly question.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.484
Because evolution
doesn't exist, of course.

11:51.496 --> 11:52.444
[ Dennis] I'm sorry?

11:52.520 --> 11:54.648
Oh, could you repeat
that again for the room?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.563
Because evolution is bullshit.
It's not real.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.371
Goddamn it!
Recess!

12:02.840 --> 12:04.888
- Now. Get in.
- What? What? What?

12:04.960 --> 12:07.964
You got to sway Charlie. You got
to make yourself credible again.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.491
What did I do?

12:09.560 --> 12:12.166
You got to stop with this-
your insane, crazy beliefs.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.288
You gotta tell them that
you believe in evolution.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.249
Oh, come on, Frank.
That's ridiculous.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.926
We gotta get Charlie to stop
thinking you're a lunatic.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.641
Look, Deandra's gonna side with Dennis.
That's a given. You want me to win?

12:22.760 --> 12:24.250
Okay, Frank, for you,

12:24.320 --> 12:27.961
I will make myself credible in
Charlie's eyes again so you can win.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.850
Just give me 15 minutes.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.806
I'm finished, guys.
I'm finished.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.089
Now this is all about making myself
credible in your eyes again,

12:39.160 --> 12:43.290
and I'm gonna do that
by admitting that evolution...

12:43.360 --> 12:44.930
is a lie!

12:45.000 --> 12:46.490
[ Frank]
Goddamn you, Mac!

12:46.560 --> 12:49.006
Yes, please do, Mac.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.327
Now, as you can see,
this is the Evolution Meter.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.802
And I've put God, the creator of
everything, on the right side.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.121
And evolution...
on the left.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.136
I went ahead and put you guys all on the
fence, 'cause of course you're gonna hear-

13:00.160 --> 13:00.859
Actually, no.

13:00.871 --> 13:03.004
[ Dennis ] Let's start
where I would start.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.243
[ Mac] No matter. I'm righteous.

13:06.320 --> 13:12.123
I'm not gonna stand here, present some
egghead scientific argument based on fact.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.569
I'm just a regular dude. I like to drink
beer, you know. I love my family.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.210
Rock, flag and eagle.
Right, Charlie?

13:18.280 --> 13:20.726
- He's got a point.
- No, he doesn't. - What?

13:20.800 --> 13:25.124
See, Charlie? These liberals are
trying to assassinate my character.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.767
And I can't change their mind. I won't
change my mind, 'cause I don't have to.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.330
'Cause I'm an American.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.687
I won't change my mind
on anything,

13:32.760 --> 13:36.321
regardless of the facts
that are set out before me.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.325
I'm dug in,
and <i>I'll</i> never change.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.970
Mac, look.
You're wasting our time.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.203
You're not gonna get us
to not believe in evolution.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.044
And why is that?

13:47.120 --> 13:51.444
Because the smartest scientists in the
entire world all agree that it's real.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.522
I'm glad you brought that up,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.090
because, Mr. Reynolds,

13:56.240 --> 13:59.642
science is a liar sometimes.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.720
Oh, boy.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.526
This is Aristotle,

14:04.600 --> 14:06.887
thought to be the smartest
man on the planet.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.566
He believed that the Earth
was the center of the universe,

14:09.640 --> 14:12.291
and everybody believed him,
because he was so smart.

14:12.360 --> 14:17.321
Until another smartest guy
came around-Galileo.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.925
And he disproved that theory,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.367
making Aristotle and
everybody else on Earth...

14:21.440 --> 14:23.966
look like a...
bitch.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.731
Of course,
Galileo then thought...

14:27.800 --> 14:30.087
comets were an optical illusion,

14:30.160 --> 14:34.051
and there was no way that the moon
could cause the ocean's tides.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.124
Everybody believed that
because he was so smart.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.521
He was also wrong,

14:39.600 --> 14:42.046
making him and everyone
else on Earth...

14:42.120 --> 14:43.804
look like a bitch again.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.651
And then, best of all, [Sighs]

14:46.720 --> 14:48.449
Sir Isaac Newton gets born...

14:48.520 --> 14:51.569
and blows everybody's nips
off with his big brains.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.720
Course, he also thought he could turn
metal into gold and died eating mercury,

14:54.760 --> 14:59.322
making him yet another
stupid... bitch!

15:01.240 --> 15:04.210
- Are you seeing a pattern?
- No.

15:04.280 --> 15:08.729
Mr. Reynolds, these were all the
smartest scientists on the planet.

15:08.800 --> 15:13.488
Only problem is, they kept being wrong.
Sometimes.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.804
This is insane, you fool.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.282
I'm a fool because I have more faith
in the saints that wrote the Bible?

15:20.360 --> 15:24.365
Yeah, because you just read the words
of a bunch of guys that you never met,

15:24.440 --> 15:28.161
and you just take it on “faith” that
everything they wrote was true.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.770
Hmm. And what
makes you think...

15:29.840 --> 15:32.650
what your scientists are writing
<i>is</i> any more truer than my <i>saints?</i>

15:32.720 --> 15:38.329
Because there are volumes of proven data.
Numbers. You know, figures.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.084
There-There are
fossil records.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.607
Oh, fossil records. Ah! I didn't
even think about the fossil records.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.082
I guess I'll concede. Oh, wait. One
more thing before I do, Mr. Reynolds.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.209
Have you seen
these fossil records?

15:50.280 --> 15:52.442
Have I s-
Huh?

15:52.520 --> 15:57.811
Have you pored through the data yourself?
The numbers? The figures?

15:57.880 --> 16:01.123
- Well, no. Um-No.
- Oh. Interesting.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.328
So let me get this straight, Mr.
Reynolds.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.240
You get your information from a book
written by men you've never met.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.488
And you take
their words as truth,

16:09.560 --> 16:12.211
based on a willingness to
believe, a desire to accept,

16:12.280 --> 16:17.369
a leap of- Oof, dare I
say it?- [ Scoffs ]

16:17.440 --> 16:18.930
Faith?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.168
Ah, come on. Come on.
Look, I mean-

16:21.240 --> 16:23.607
I don't even know how I'm supposed
to respond to that. Like-

16:23.680 --> 16:25.887
Ah, come on.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.361
That is a-
That's a false equivalency.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.205
Just answer the question,
Mr. Reynolds.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.926
Sure.
Yeah, okay.

16:36.760 --> 16:40.685
- I rest my case.
- Wow. Well, that got me.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.256
- Frank, do you want me to-
- Put me over.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.089
- Yeah, all right.
- What?

16:44.160 --> 16:46.736
Well, we're going on the fence. I
mean, that's a shadow of a doubt.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.530
You actually don't believe
in evolution anymore?

16:48.542 --> 16:49.136
I don't know.

16:49.160 --> 16:53.085
He created a reasonable doubt. He makes you
sound like a stupid, uh, science bitch.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.640
[ Dee ] Yeah, he got you good.
Oh, my God.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.336
[ Chattering ] [ Dennis ]
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What-

17:00.360 --> 17:01.930
What are we even talking about?

17:02.040 --> 17:05.203
How did we get onto evolution?
This is not about evolution.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.576
Well, it became about that when
you attacked Mac's character!

17:07.599 --> 17:09.170
Yeah, like they did
in the O.J. trial...

17:09.280 --> 17:12.045
to that hero cop, Mark Fuhrman.
Right!

17:12.119 --> 17:15.840
Okay, let's just get back on track here. I
would like to make my closing arguments.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.127
No, no, no, no, no.
This has gone on long enough.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.443
And by the way, Dee, why the hell do you
give a shit about any of this anyway?

17:23.160 --> 17:26.448
You don't know? You can't
think of why I might like...

17:26.520 --> 17:30.650
to set a precedent of responsibility
for when someone's car gets destroyed?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.722
No.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.885
Anybody else?
Anybody?

17:36.960 --> 17:40.362
I- I can't really think of anything.
Can you think of anything?

17:40.440 --> 17:42.727
- I'm blank.
- Not ringing a bell for me.

17:42.800 --> 17:47.283
You guys have destroyed every
single car that I have ever owned!

17:47.360 --> 17:49.336
And we've never had so much
as a conversation about it,

17:49.360 --> 17:52.125
much less a trial-
a whole trial!

17:52.240 --> 17:55.323
Are you making that up? Isn't
this-what is she talking about?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.600
- Are you sure that happened?
- Oh, you sons of bitches.

17:57.720 --> 18:02.169
Oh, you goddamn sons of bitches! I am
going to destroy everything you own!

18:02.240 --> 18:04.447
- Ooh.
- You know what? I'm gonna end this.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.324
I'm gonna end this!
[ Exclaims]

18:06.400 --> 18:08.880
I still vote for Dennis.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.411
Well, I'm still for Frank.
Yeah.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.804
And I am actually
gonna go to the fence.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.405
[ Dennis ]
What? God.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.086
Oh, goddamn it!
We're nowhere with this.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.611
All right, okay.
Guys, settle down.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.856
I think if we've learned anything
today, it's that, you know,

18:22.880 --> 18:25.884
we can't just take
things based on faith.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.002
Only seeing is believing, right?

18:29.080 --> 18:31.526
Let's take this to the streets.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.807
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah, man. No worries.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.649
Have a good one. Have a nice day.
Bye-bye.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.376
Okay, here's the deal. Dennis, if you
can drive to your apartment and back...

18:41.400 --> 18:42.925
without spilling a single drop,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.336
Dee, your precedent is set, and,
Frank, you pay for everything.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.361
Fine.
Good.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.880
Okay. And, Frank,
if you can drive...

18:47.920 --> 18:49.936
to our place and back
without getting in an accident,

18:49.960 --> 18:51.732
with me giving you
directions, you can continue

18:51.744 --> 18:53.416
to drive as long as I'm
in the car with you.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.566
Deal!
All right.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.887
On your mark. Get set.
Go! [Grunts]

18:58.240 --> 19:00.004
- Did he say it was a race?
- No.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.004
Why are they running? [
Chuckles ] I have no idea.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.369
All right, steady. Steady as she goes.
I'm going straight.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.084
No, beautiful stuff.
This is the best.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.965
Dee, uh, please prepare
me a bowl of cereal. Yep.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.607
What are you doing? We gotta see for
ourselves how reckless this is.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.650
You hold it in one hand and drive
with the other. Interesting.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.047
I know. Pretty mind-blowing
stuff, isn't it?

19:20.120 --> 19:22.009
Then I stop at a stoplight,

19:22.080 --> 19:25.482
and, once I'm stopped
and everything is safe,

19:25.600 --> 19:27.045
take a bite.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.242
All right. Here we go.
Make a left right there.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.691
Make a what? Uh-huh. Go left.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.896
Make a left. Right. Go left.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.729
Right? Right or left?
No!

19:33.840 --> 19:36.280
[ Dee, Charlie Shouting ] Make
up your mind! Deandra, shut up!

19:36.320 --> 19:39.847
Well, dude, now that we're
alone, you can admit it.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.890
I mean, I swayed you on
evolution a little bit, right?

19:42.960 --> 19:45.247
[ Scoffs ]
Well-Uh-

19:45.360 --> 19:49.126
[Tires Screeching ]
Ugh!

19:49.200 --> 19:51.680
That's crazy!
That is insane!

19:51.760 --> 19:54.161
- How do you hit me again?
- It was Deandra's fault!

19:54.280 --> 19:56.851
What? She gave me the wrong directions.
This way, that way!

19:56.920 --> 19:59.256
It was Dee's fault. I was trying to
give directions and she interrupted me.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.191
What are you talking about?
I was reiterating.

20:01.203 --> 20:02.921
Charlie was giving
directions, and I was-

20:03.040 --> 20:04.960
So this is your fault? No, wait.
This is perfect.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.686
