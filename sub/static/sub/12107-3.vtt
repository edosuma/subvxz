<b>give anything up, why should we?</b>

08:50.931 --> 08:53.200
<b>- But--but--</b>
<b>polar bear?</b>

08:53.200 --> 08:54.868
<b>- Aww--wait a minute.</b>

08:54.868 --> 08:56.637
<b>You can't use that</b>
<b>on us anymore.</b>

08:56.637 --> 09:00.073
<b>- Come on, girls.</b>
<b>Let's go get our stuff back.</b>

09:00.073 --> 09:03.844
<b>- And a refill.</b>

09:03.844 --> 09:06.213
<b>- Well, I guess you're</b>
<b>going back into the red.</b>

09:06.213 --> 09:08.782
<b>- Which means you're gonna lose</b>
<b>the polar bear challenge</b>

09:08.782 --> 09:10.017
<b>for our class.</b>

09:10.017 --> 09:12.019
<b>- Which means we can't</b>
<b>be seen with you.</b>

09:12.019 --> 09:15.722
<b>- Which means your social life</b>
<b>is out the window.</b>

09:15.722 --> 09:17.858
<b>- Guys, wait!</b>
<b>Come back!</b>

09:17.858 --> 09:19.393
<b>I can make adjustments.</b>

09:19.393 --> 09:22.095
<b>I blew it.</b>
<b>- Don't worry, Lincoln.</b>

09:22.095 --> 09:25.265
<b>I'll still hang out with you--</b>
<b>in secret, of course.</b>

09:25.265 --> 09:26.800
<b>- It's not about that,</b>
<b>Clyde.</b>

09:26.800 --> 09:28.769
<b>I don't care</b>
<b>if the class hates me.</b>

09:28.769 --> 09:30.871
<b>What I should have cared about</b>
<b>all along is--</b>

09:30.871 --> 09:31.872
<b>this guy.</b>

09:31.872 --> 09:33.140
<b>- Aww...</b>

09:33.140 --> 09:35.576
<b>- Exactly.</b>
<b>Our class has done their part.</b>

09:35.576 --> 09:37.377
<b>My sisters have done theirs.</b>

09:37.377 --> 09:39.413
<b>Now it's time for me</b>
<b>to do mine.</b>

09:41.248 --> 09:44.251
<b>[stereo blasting rock music]</b>

09:44.251 --> 09:45.452

<b>[pie splatters, beeping]</b>
<b>- [laughing]</b>

09:48.956 --> 09:51.058
<b>- [humming]</b>

09:51.058 --> 09:52.159
<b>[electricity buzzing]</b>

09:52.159 --> 09:54.761
<b>- [laughing]</b>

09:54.761 --> 09:56.864
<b>- [giggling]</b>
<b>Oh, Bobby.</b>

09:56.864 --> 09:59.166
<b>You got me a present?</b>
<b>I can't wait to see it.</b>

09:59.166 --> 10:04.037
<b>- [panting]</b>

10:04.037 --> 10:05.973
<b> <i>- Lincoln, pedal faster!</i> </b>

10:05.973 --> 10:09.510
<b> <i>I'm downloading a pic</i> </b>
<b> <i>from Bobby.</i> </b>

10:09.510 --> 10:11.445
<b>- Amazing work, class.</b>

10:11.445 --> 10:13.914
<b>We won the polar bear challenge!</b>

10:13.914 --> 10:17.050
<b>And I took the liberty</b>
<b>of naming him...</b>

10:17.050 --> 10:19.319
<b>Mrs. Johnson!</b>

10:19.319 --> 10:20.988
<b>all: Mrs. Johnson?</b>
<b>[muttering]</b>

10:20.988 --> 10:23.724
<b>- Let's all give Lincoln</b>
<b>a round of applause</b>

10:23.724 --> 10:27.528
<b>for stepping up his green game</b>
<b>and doing his part.</b>

10:27.528 --> 10:29.596
<b>[all cheering]</b>

10:29.596 --> 10:33.200
<b>- Well, I saved the polar bear,</b>
<b>and I'm not an outcast.</b>

10:33.200 --> 10:35.636
<b>Although,</b>
<b>technically speaking,</b>

10:35.636 --> 10:40.541
<b>my social life</b>
<b>is out the window.</b>

10:40.541 --> 10:43.010
<b>Do you mind?</b>
<b>I'm showering!</b>
