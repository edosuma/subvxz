02:06.280 --> 02:07.952
At the height of the Ming Dynasty...

02:08.240 --> 02:10.878
The Emperor's eunuchs gained excessive power

02:11.440 --> 02:13.431
They abused their position...

02:13.760 --> 02:16.399
... and set up an East Bureau
and a West Bureau

02:16.920 --> 02:19.559
All government officials
were closely spied on

02:21.240 --> 02:23.515
East Bureau,
or the East Investigation Bureau...

02:23.800 --> 02:26.997
... infiltrated agents into
all major government offices

02:27.280 --> 02:29.874
Officials were investigated and arrested

02:30.080 --> 02:33.356
Many died in the grip of East Bureau agents

02:34.920 --> 02:35.670
West Bureau...

02:35.880 --> 02:37.108
... was the Emperor's secret service

02:37.440 --> 02:39.317
It was responsible
for gathering intelligence

02:39.520 --> 02:41.272
It cast its nets far and wide

02:41.400 --> 02:42.469
Charges were fabricated

02:42.760 --> 02:44.034
Victims were locked up

02:44.680 --> 02:47.672
The name 'West Bureau'
induced fear and panic

02:47.800 --> 02:51.349
Suspects faced immediate arrest and torture

02:52.440 --> 02:53.919
Today, the head of East Bureau...

02:54.120 --> 02:56.350
... Wan Yulou...

02:56.600 --> 02:58.875
... visits Longjiang Naval Shipyard

02:59.120 --> 03:00.394
Instead of inspection...

03:00.720 --> 03:03.075
His ulterior motive is to arrest opponents

03:03.440 --> 03:06.432
And to execute them on the spot!

03:13.760 --> 03:16.320
Bring the Minister of Law
and Junior War Minister!

03:17.440 --> 03:18.156
At hand!

03:19.040 --> 03:20.314
Bring the prisoners!
Bring the prisoners!

03:22.720 --> 03:24.711
Here are the prisoners!
Here are the prisoners!

03:27.680 --> 03:29.238
Kneel! Face judgment!

03:29.720 --> 03:32.632
You two tried to report that I take bribes!

03:32.720 --> 03:35.439
That I extort money from officials?

03:36.400 --> 03:38.675
Before your letter reached the Emperor...

03:38.760 --> 03:40.273
I intercepted it

03:42.200 --> 03:44.031
You think to challenge East Bureau!

03:44.280 --> 03:46.748
You are like soldiers in a defeated army

03:47.760 --> 03:50.593
Fatally weakened, skulking in the shadows

03:52.600 --> 03:54.591
But you're not bold enough...

03:55.200 --> 03:58.033
... to report me to the Emperor

03:59.440 --> 04:01.829
There is someone else behind you!

04:02.160 --> 04:05.470
Minister of Five Armies! Step forward!

04:11.560 --> 04:13.869
Can Qianzhi,
Minister of Five Armies, reporting

04:14.520 --> 04:16.589
You are a master of treachery!

04:16.600 --> 04:19.672
You hid your plot
behind two fifth-grade officials!

04:20.440 --> 04:22.670
Behind your smooth talk, you're a plotter!

04:23.040 --> 04:25.031
Sorry, but I must undo your hard work

04:25.240 --> 04:25.911
Guards!

04:27.440 --> 04:30.796
Time to taste some pickled body-parts!

04:32.520 --> 04:34.078
Cut off his tongue!

04:34.360 --> 04:35.076
Sir!

04:35.240 --> 04:36.036
Restrain the prisoners!

04:47.880 --> 04:49.632
Alert! There's someone on the drum tower!

04:57.240 --> 04:58.229
Attack on the right!

05:06.840 --> 05:07.875
The Captain is taken! Your Eminence!

05:08.560 --> 05:09.276
Don't worry

05:09.280 --> 05:10.269
We're here to rescue you

06:13.960 --> 06:15.791
So you're wearing concealed
protective armor!

06:16.960 --> 06:18.393
You're said to be highly skilled

06:18.920 --> 06:20.911
You fear assassination even
with all these guards?

06:21.320 --> 06:22.355
Tell me...

06:22.680 --> 06:25.148
... whose body I'm going to pickle

06:25.360 --> 06:26.156
My name is...

06:26.600 --> 06:27.794
... Zhao Huai'an

06:28.760 --> 06:30.273
But you won't need to remember it

06:30.720 --> 06:32.711
I'll carve my name on your cursed head

06:33.040 --> 06:34.359
So everyone will know who killed you

06:36.360 --> 06:39.432
You're with the Civil Service Minister

06:41.680 --> 06:43.238
He's already dead

06:43.360 --> 06:44.509
You're just ensuring that...

06:44.680 --> 06:47.069
... the last of his men die too!

06:47.200 --> 06:49.430
I'm surviving better than your manhood did!

07:02.400 --> 07:04.072
You've drunk so much pickled-flesh wine...

07:04.400 --> 07:06.391
... that you can't even draw your sword

07:07.080 --> 07:08.399
You really deserve to die

07:08.960 --> 07:09.915
How dare you?

07:53.760 --> 07:54.556
Foul eunuch!

07:55.680 --> 07:57.238
Your lackeys and your enemies...

07:57.360 --> 07:58.236
... are all watching

07:58.800 --> 08:01.109
They will tell the world of your fate

08:01.560 --> 08:02.436
Go to hell!

08:10.760 --> 08:11.431
Hurry, report this!

08:17.680 --> 08:18.715
Lock all the gates!

08:19.760 --> 08:20.192
Wait for orders!

08:20.360 --> 08:21.395
Sir!

08:27.200 --> 08:27.916
Your Eminence...

08:28.600 --> 08:30.909
... your family have been moved to safety

08:31.400 --> 08:33.436
You will see them again very soon

08:33.919 --> 08:35.034
You may sleep easy

08:36.400 --> 08:37.957
Thank you for saving us

08:38.039 --> 08:40.395
Farewell Farewell

08:44.720 --> 08:45.675
The Imperial Court...

08:45.840 --> 08:47.910
... is so bad that...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.274
... men like us have to mete out justice

08:50.200 --> 08:51.189
It's a pity

08:51.440 --> 08:52.555
Without good officials...

08:53.200 --> 08:54.997
Who will care for the people?

08:56.960 --> 08:58.188
In the past months...

08:58.880 --> 09:00.154
We've decimated...

09:01.240 --> 09:03.356
... the powerful eunuchs
who ran the East Bureau

09:04.520 --> 09:05.748
Now they're gone...

09:06.320 --> 09:08.880
The good officials will soon come back

09:10.240 --> 09:11.719
Any obstacle can be surmounted

09:12.960 --> 09:14.678
If their best fighters come for us...

09:15.520 --> 09:17.078
Things won't be settled so easily

09:25.600 --> 09:28.353
DAJUE TEMPLE

09:30.920 --> 09:32.672
The front and back doors are well guarded

09:33.040 --> 09:35.429
Many guards are deployed
to the east and west

09:35.800 --> 09:37.950
The temple is secured both inside and out

09:38.200 --> 09:40.475
Unauthorized persons will be killed

09:40.680 --> 09:41.351
You may leave

09:42.160 --> 09:42.956
Sir!

09:44.320 --> 09:46.550
How should we report this to the Emperor?

09:46.960 --> 09:47.870
Let's discuss this

09:49.560 --> 09:50.788
It needs careful consideration

09:51.040 --> 09:52.189
Thanks to that Zhao Huai'an...

09:52.360 --> 09:53.679
We're forced to hide here!

09:54.520 --> 09:55.555
What if we don't report?

09:55.760 --> 09:56.670
No, we can't

09:56.760 --> 09:58.716
Despite the witnesses that day...

09:59.200 --> 10:01.430
Does the Emperor have to be told?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.757
If anyone speaks up, I'll silence him

10:04.360 --> 10:05.270
It's so simple

10:13.560 --> 10:14.959
Report!

10:15.240 --> 10:16.639
Eunuch Yu of West Bureau is here...

10:16.840 --> 10:17.875
... with his subordinates

10:18.280 --> 10:20.077
This is a matter for East Bureau!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.309
Why is he here?

10:21.480 --> 10:22.356
A single swordsman...

10:22.480 --> 10:23.913
... has you cowering in fear!

10:24.560 --> 10:26.676
So you hide here...

10:27.080 --> 10:28.672
Too scared to return to the palace!

10:28.800 --> 10:31.712
Isn't it my business if they attack us too?

10:35.080 --> 10:36.433
Attack you too?

10:36.760 --> 10:38.239
They're no more than a rabble

10:38.680 --> 10:40.238
East Bureau will soon deal with them

10:40.680 --> 10:42.079
That day at the Naval Shipyard...

10:42.600 --> 10:43.874
Weren't you well protected?

10:44.760 --> 10:47.194
Some man named Zhao...

10:47.280 --> 10:49.350
... had no trouble decapitated your leader

10:50.080 --> 10:53.038
There's nobody here except cowards...

10:53.680 --> 10:55.875
How could you manage to deal with him?

10:56.360 --> 10:58.590
Eunuch Wan was careless

10:58.800 --> 10:59.596
He underestimated his foe

11:00.080 --> 11:00.830
Underestimated?

11:02.440 --> 11:03.509
He's too weak!

11:04.720 --> 11:07.393
East Bureau's 'masters'
have been killed one by one

11:07.640 --> 11:09.119
Your chiefs, captains, team heads...

11:09.960 --> 11:11.632
Your turn next!

11:11.640 --> 11:12.231
How dare you!

11:12.560 --> 11:13.515
Sit down

11:13.920 --> 11:15.751
You think you'll be safe, hiding here?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.589
We are imperial servants to help the Emperor

11:19.440 --> 11:20.919
Who do you think you are?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.556
West Bureau was formed only recently

11:24.040 --> 11:25.234
And you dare...

11:25.400 --> 11:27.231
... to confront me like this?

11:47.280 --> 11:48.076
Sir...

11:53.520 --> 11:55.670
You ask who we think we are?

12:03.680 --> 12:05.432
I'll tell you

12:05.960 --> 12:08.554
West Bureau exists
to remedy East Bureau's failures!

12:09.400 --> 12:10.116
Listen well...

12:10.400 --> 12:11.389
There's more!

12:16.920 --> 12:18.956
I will kill those that
East Bureau dares not kill!

12:19.160 --> 12:20.832
I will take care of what
East Bureau botches!

12:21.640 --> 12:22.390
Whatever East Bureau manages...

12:23.280 --> 12:25.111
I will take over

12:26.080 --> 12:28.036
Whatever East Bureau can't manage,
I will manage

12:28.600 --> 12:30.670
We are empowered to
act without prior approval!

12:31.640 --> 12:33.710
That's who we are!

12:36.440 --> 12:37.793
Is that clear enough?

12:46.520 --> 12:48.192
Concubine Wan is summoning him again

12:50.920 --> 12:52.239
That Johnny-come-lately...

12:52.560 --> 12:54.357
... treats the palace like his home!

12:56.080 --> 12:57.672
He's even on her bed!

12:58.680 --> 12:59.715
THE CONCUBINES' QUARTERS

12:59.720 --> 13:01.392
Your Ladyship!

13:02.200 --> 13:03.030
Your Ladyship...

13:03.160 --> 13:06.197
Eunuch Yu of West Bureau has been waiting

13:07.680 --> 13:08.635
Send for him

13:14.680 --> 13:16.750
Treasure of my heart...

13:17.440 --> 13:18.668
Come here!

13:27.920 --> 13:29.239
I gave you West Bureau...

13:29.400 --> 13:31.277
... to maintain control here

13:31.560 --> 13:33.596
Why are you needling East Bureau?

13:34.400 --> 13:35.879
Your duty is to keep the maids...

13:36.040 --> 13:37.996
... out of His Majesty's bed

13:38.080 --> 13:39.229
Why waste time on...

13:39.240 --> 13:42.152
... those old men of East Bureau?

13:42.560 --> 13:43.788
Wouldn't I be happier...

13:43.960 --> 13:46.190
... if you stayed here with me?

13:46.560 --> 13:49.358
Your Ladyship,
I always take your orders seriously

13:49.640 --> 13:50.629
If His Majesty...

13:50.760 --> 13:52.591
... so much as glances at another woman...

13:52.720 --> 13:54.119
She's gone by next day

13:54.960 --> 13:56.109
Please don't worry

13:57.400 --> 13:58.958
Your Ladyship is the only woman...

13:59.320 --> 14:01.038
... allowed to get pregnant here

14:02.760 --> 14:05.797
I've found several pregnancies
among the maids

14:07.240 --> 14:08.719
Who are these hussies...

14:08.920 --> 14:10.717
... who've let men take advantage?

14:12.040 --> 14:13.439
Of the four...

14:13.960 --> 14:16.554
Three are said to have been with guards

14:17.080 --> 14:19.275
To forestall any rumor
involving His Majesty...

14:19.720 --> 14:21.199
I've had the women executed

14:22.080 --> 14:23.354
Four wretches...

14:23.440 --> 14:24.429
... three executions

14:24.920 --> 14:26.035
And the fourth woman?

14:26.640 --> 14:27.629
She got away

14:28.240 --> 14:29.389
Her name is Su Huirong

14:29.760 --> 14:31.751
I've sent men to catch and kill her

15:00.600 --> 15:01.953
It's a large troop

15:02.200 --> 15:03.076
Who are they after?

15:03.760 --> 15:04.556
Judging by their banners...

15:05.560 --> 15:06.879
They're from West Bureau

15:08.880 --> 15:10.632
They're heading for Red Rock Gully

15:11.200 --> 15:12.110
Let's see...

15:12.320 --> 15:13.389
... what's going on over there

15:30.440 --> 15:31.555
There's someone on the chain up there

15:33.080 --> 15:34.229
Who is he?

15:34.760 --> 15:35.590
Watch him carefully

15:36.560 --> 15:37.231
Boatman...

15:37.560 --> 15:38.675
Pull in here

15:38.880 --> 15:39.869
We must search the boat!

15:41.880 --> 15:43.279
Stop rowing

15:43.760 --> 15:44.795
Officials want to search the boat

15:44.920 --> 15:45.909
Stop rowing!

15:47.200 --> 15:48.349
There is nothing on the boat

15:48.840 --> 15:49.989
Please let us go on our way

15:50.280 --> 15:51.156
Go? You don't even know...

15:51.240 --> 15:52.355
... what we're looking for

15:52.720 --> 15:53.232
Come here

15:54.280 --> 15:54.917
No, sir...

15:54.920 --> 15:55.636
No...

15:55.880 --> 15:57.359
We sail our boat here everyday

15:57.760 --> 15:58.590
We hide nothing

15:59.200 --> 16:00.189
How many women on your boat?

16:00.680 --> 16:01.874
Tell them all to go to the bow

16:04.800 --> 16:05.596
What is it?

16:06.040 --> 16:06.916
It was thrown from the boat

16:06.920 --> 16:07.432
Report it!

16:10.080 --> 16:10.796
Report!

16:10.920 --> 16:11.591
Sir!

16:11.760 --> 16:13.716
This scented purse was found in the water

16:14.920 --> 16:16.876
The handiwork looks familiar

16:17.800 --> 16:19.074
Who allowed you to sit?

16:20.200 --> 16:21.076
Sir, don't hit her

16:21.240 --> 16:22.195
My wife is sick

16:22.400 --> 16:23.753
Who cares?

16:29.240 --> 16:29.911
Stand up!

16:30.040 --> 16:30.631
No...

16:33.240 --> 16:33.956
Off the boat!

16:39.960 --> 16:41.757
This purse is costly

16:41.880 --> 16:43.632
Why was it thrown away?

16:46.800 --> 16:48.358
The scent...

16:53.400 --> 16:55.277
Let's see if it lingers

17:02.200 --> 17:03.553
Have you run away from the palace?

17:04.880 --> 17:05.517
Sir...

17:05.760 --> 17:06.431
I am...

17:07.359 --> 17:09.237
Speak up

17:10.280 --> 17:11.998
What's in your belly?

17:12.560 --> 17:13.435
Let's take a look inside

17:14.480 --> 17:15.230
Yes, sir!

17:19.200 --> 17:20.155
Restrain her!

17:26.920 --> 17:28.512
Don't, sir

17:28.680 --> 17:29.556
Let me go

17:29.760 --> 17:31.671
Let my unborn baby go

17:32.360 --> 17:33.554
You are Su Huirong?

17:37.360 --> 17:38.270
Yes, sir

18:15.680 --> 18:16.908
Check if she has an accomplice!

18:22.040 --> 18:22.950
Guard the criminal!

18:44.480 --> 18:45.674
Release the woman

18:48.720 --> 18:49.630
I'll say it again

18:49.960 --> 18:51.075
Let her go!

18:54.760 --> 18:55.715
Release her!

18:57.520 --> 18:58.555
All of you, back away!

19:03.240 --> 19:04.514
They're not going

19:04.960 --> 19:06.871
They must want me to kill you

19:07.280 --> 19:08.918
Back off! Do you want him to kill me?

19:09.600 --> 19:10.794
Tell them to jump in the water

19:12.520 --> 19:14.112
Why are you standing there? Jump!

19:14.240 --> 19:14.831
All of you!

19:15.400 --> 19:16.071
Jump in the water!

19:16.880 --> 19:17.630
Jump!

19:25.680 --> 19:27.671
Good, I will spare your life

19:27.920 --> 19:29.399
Go back and do one thing for me

19:29.960 --> 19:31.757
Tell your Boss my name...

19:32.120 --> 19:33.109
Zhao Huai'an

19:34.520 --> 19:35.236
Zhao Huai'an?

19:36.360 --> 19:37.236
You are Zhao Huai'an?

19:39.280 --> 19:40.759
Now, climb to the top of the scaffolding

19:41.440 --> 19:42.873
Stay there for four hours...

19:43.160 --> 19:44.275
Then you may go

20:00.520 --> 20:02.078
I told you to stay put

20:02.240 --> 20:03.150
What are you looking at?

20:03.560 --> 20:04.709
Checking that I'm still here?

20:19.680 --> 20:20.396
Great knight...

20:21.960 --> 20:22.790
Great knight...

20:23.360 --> 20:24.713
Shouldn't we get away from here?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.389
I know you are a martial-arts master...

20:27.760 --> 20:29.512
But we should not stay here

20:35.520 --> 20:36.748
I'm waiting for someone

20:38.200 --> 20:39.189
Waiting...

20:39.600 --> 20:40.635
Who are you waiting for?

20:42.080 --> 20:43.593
Such beautiful scenery

20:45.000 --> 20:45.955
Let's drink

20:53.920 --> 20:54.591
Brother Zhao

20:55.560 --> 20:57.391
He's having a drink,
just like the other times

20:58.160 --> 21:00.355
Then, let's have a drink too

21:00.960 --> 21:02.439
He's impersonating you to rescue people

21:02.560 --> 21:03.913
Is he trying to lure you into a meeting?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.069
Let him be

21:06.680 --> 21:07.908
Isn't it good that he rescues people?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.120
We could do with a few more Zhao Huai'ans!

21:11.320 --> 21:11.757
For you

21:14.360 --> 21:14.951
Brother Zhao...

21:15.080 --> 21:16.433
I think you know each other

21:17.000 --> 21:18.035
Why don't you greet him?

21:19.560 --> 21:20.709
We're both loners...

21:21.960 --> 21:22.995
... old jianhu friends

21:24.000 --> 21:25.877
No need for us to meet

22:20.040 --> 22:21.029
A carrier pigeon

22:21.920 --> 22:23.956
Those West Bureau people released it?

22:25.440 --> 22:26.429
It's flying west

22:27.520 --> 22:28.316
That means...

22:28.800 --> 22:30.233
... their Boss has already left the capital

22:30.400 --> 22:31.037
It's weird

22:31.400 --> 22:33.231
Did West Bureau send a force like that...

22:33.400 --> 22:35.277
... just to chase a pregnant woman?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.513
They will send more troops

22:39.320 --> 22:40.673
Let's see if we can help

22:57.080 --> 22:58.559
Inform His Highness. All is in order

22:59.240 --> 22:59.877
Sir!

23:25.680 --> 23:26.829
Report! A carrier pigeon has arrived

23:29.520 --> 23:31.511
News from Red Rock Gully?

23:31.760 --> 23:32.351
Your Highness...

23:32.840 --> 23:34.432
Su Huirong was rescued by a swordsman

23:34.520 --> 23:35.509
He gave his name as Zhao Huai'an

23:37.960 --> 23:38.597
Jinliang...

23:38.760 --> 23:40.352
Which way do you think...

23:40.560 --> 23:41.913
... the fugitives will go?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.712
East would be...

23:43.920 --> 23:44.875
... back to the capital

23:45.400 --> 23:46.753
North would take them to the border

23:47.560 --> 23:48.754
So, they will go north?

23:48.880 --> 23:50.074
They could cross it within two days

23:50.160 --> 23:51.354
Can a pregnant woman survive...

23:52.200 --> 23:53.918
... riding a horse that far?

23:54.520 --> 23:55.555
If they went northwest by water...

23:55.800 --> 23:56.710
It would take longer

23:56.880 --> 23:58.074
But they could cut through Chiayu Pass

23:58.200 --> 24:00.191
And follow the Luo River to Dragon Gate

24:01.280 --> 24:02.838
Let's wait at Dragon Gate

24:04.200 --> 24:04.996
Set the main sail!

24:05.560 --> 24:06.675
Sail northwest...

24:06.880 --> 24:07.869
... at full speed!

24:08.360 --> 24:09.634
Set the main sail!

24:13.160 --> 24:14.115
There's two men at the bow

24:14.200 --> 24:14.871
Protect His Highness!

24:22.000 --> 24:23.797
So these are West Bureau men?

24:24.160 --> 24:27.232
Let's see if they're as good as people say

24:30.120 --> 24:30.950
Move!

24:40.360 --> 24:41.315
Who are you?

24:52.440 --> 24:55.193
I am Chief of West Bureau, Ma Jinliang

25:00.360 --> 25:01.349
The sail is collapsing!
Protect His Highness!

25:01.440 --> 25:02.236
Go to hell!

25:20.080 --> 25:21.308
And who are you in West Bureau?

25:22.480 --> 25:23.708
Yu Huatian

25:24.440 --> 25:25.998
And you are...?

25:26.200 --> 25:27.599
I'm the nemesis of both bureaux

25:27.960 --> 25:28.870
Zhao Huai'an

27:28.440 --> 27:29.190
Ling Guozhou...

27:29.280 --> 27:29.917
This way!

27:30.520 --> 27:32.192
Archers, get to the bow!

27:32.200 --> 27:32.837
Sir!

27:33.040 --> 27:34.029
Load your arrows!

27:37.880 --> 27:39.472
Take Chongzheng!

27:39.600 --> 27:40.316
Guozhou!

27:42.320 --> 27:43.435
Go to hell!

27:44.560 --> 27:45.356
Go!

27:56.600 --> 27:57.157
Your Highness...

27:57.320 --> 27:57.991
The so-called Zhao Huai'an...

27:58.240 --> 28:00.037
... was not so hard for you to deal with

28:01.280 --> 28:03.236
But Zhao is with Su Huirong...

28:03.400 --> 28:04.719
So what's he doing here?

28:04.960 --> 28:05.870
Was that an imposter?

28:07.200 --> 28:07.950
No

28:08.360 --> 28:10.555
He took on East Bureau in the same way

28:11.400 --> 28:12.515
He's not an imposter

28:13.400 --> 28:14.435
If he's the real Zhao...

28:14.640 --> 28:17.279
Who's the one with Su in Red Rock Gully?

28:17.400 --> 28:19.436
No matter how many
Zhao Huai'ans there are...

28:19.600 --> 28:22.398
I will hang their severed
heads outside West Bureau

28:25.000 --> 28:27.036
He won't elude me

28:27.280 --> 28:28.679
Keep on following Su Huirong

28:28.680 --> 28:31.148
We'll show East Bureau
how to deal with such foes

28:31.800 --> 28:32.949
Yes! Your Highness!

29:10.720 --> 29:11.630
Great knight...

29:12.280 --> 29:14.714
What are the words carved on the two steles?

29:14.920 --> 29:17.309
They're in Xixia script,
more than 400 years old

29:18.240 --> 29:19.992
Thanks to erosion by the wind and sand...

29:20.120 --> 29:22.839
Only the characters
'Dragon' and 'Gate' are legible

29:23.320 --> 29:25.311
That's why this place is called Dragon Gate

29:25.920 --> 29:28.229
Yumen Pass is nearby, to the west

29:28.400 --> 29:29.833
That's your escape route

29:29.960 --> 29:31.109
They won't dare follow you

29:31.880 --> 29:33.472
I should go alone?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.034
You'll stop protecting me?

29:35.880 --> 29:37.199
I told you at the start...

29:37.400 --> 29:38.719
I'd bring you to safety...

29:39.000 --> 29:39.910
Then leave you to go on alone

29:41.360 --> 29:42.156
Come on

29:48.320 --> 29:48.991
Great knight...

29:49.320 --> 29:50.719
You keep playing that flute

29:51.000 --> 29:53.230
My guess is that it's a love token

29:53.320 --> 29:53.832
Am I right?

29:53.960 --> 29:54.710
Good guess

29:55.240 --> 29:56.753
It is a love token...

29:56.880 --> 29:57.756
But not for me

29:58.840 --> 29:59.989
It's for someone else

30:01.040 --> 30:01.995
Who?

30:03.240 --> 30:04.912
Why should you care?

30:05.280 --> 30:07.350
Anyway, this flute is not mine

30:07.440 --> 30:09.192
I must give it
to someone on behalf of its owner

30:10.000 --> 30:11.149
If you mention the flute again...

30:11.560 --> 30:12.879
I will stop talking to you

30:13.680 --> 30:14.271
Understand?

30:15.400 --> 30:16.196
Yes

30:22.360 --> 30:23.236
Do I look like her?

30:23.560 --> 30:24.310
Look like who?

30:25.160 --> 30:26.798
The one you're seeking

30:30.720 --> 30:31.675
Listen!

30:31.680 --> 30:33.079
If you ask any more thing about me...

30:33.400 --> 30:34.435
I'll abandon you

30:34.800 --> 30:36.028
You'll never see me again

30:52.440 --> 30:53.156
Jump!

30:53.400 --> 30:54.116
I'll catch you!

30:57.760 --> 30:58.795
How can I jump?

30:59.200 --> 30:59.950
I am pregnant

31:00.280 --> 31:01.156
I can't jump

31:33.160 --> 31:33.717
Great knight...

32:43.480 --> 32:46.153
Our goods packed already? Yes

32:46.560 --> 32:48.198
Check if the other side is tied properly

32:48.680 --> 32:49.430
Yes

32:50.040 --> 32:53.430
Take more water, we'll leave soon

32:54.000 --> 32:55.558
I just arrived,
and you're telling me to leave?

32:55.800 --> 32:56.437
What kind of inn is this?

32:57.280 --> 32:58.554
I'm so sorry

32:58.880 --> 33:00.598
Tomorrow or the day after...

33:00.800 --> 33:02.279
The black sandstorm will arrive

33:02.560 --> 33:04.039
That flock of birds...

33:04.240 --> 33:05.355
... was a sign

33:05.720 --> 33:06.948
It will be a huge sandstorm

33:07.240 --> 33:09.879
It will bury the inn

33:10.040 --> 33:10.790
No water and no food

33:11.040 --> 33:13.076
Even our staff will shelter
in the courier station

33:13.440 --> 33:15.112
Gentlemen...

33:15.320 --> 33:17.470
I'm sorry, because of the weather...

33:17.480 --> 33:18.151
Say no more

33:18.280 --> 33:19.713
We're passing through,
we'll leave after eating

33:24.320 --> 33:24.957
I'm so sorry

33:25.200 --> 33:25.791
How far is the courier station?

33:26.240 --> 33:28.151
The courier station is 50 li from here

33:28.280 --> 33:29.429
The mountains there...

33:29.760 --> 33:31.159
... could block the wind

33:31.520 --> 33:33.750
They have food and water there

33:34.120 --> 33:35.553
It'll take half a day by camel

33:36.760 --> 33:38.239
Take plenty of water

33:38.360 --> 33:40.032
Water is a necessity in a desert

33:42.280 --> 33:43.235
I forgot the dried food

33:43.320 --> 33:43.797
I have it, I have it

33:43.880 --> 33:44.437
Go!

33:44.560 --> 33:45.993
I'm so sorry

33:46.080 --> 33:47.638
Travel safely!

33:47.800 --> 33:48.869
Saddle up. Load the cargo!

33:55.080 --> 33:56.479
I told you to let no-one in

33:56.640 --> 33:57.709
So who are they?

33:59.360 --> 34:02.113
They ignored me. I couldn't stop them

34:04.960 --> 34:05.756
I know

34:05.880 --> 34:06.710
We'll leave after our meal

34:06.960 --> 34:07.631
Guests...

34:07.920 --> 34:09.273
Have some peanuts and dried fruits

34:09.639 --> 34:10.708
What would you like to order?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.911
Can you do mutton soup... with noodle?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.433
Mutton soup with noodle, yes

34:16.000 --> 34:17.433
No, we'll have two bowls of plain noodles

34:17.600 --> 34:18.350
Nothing else

34:18.600 --> 34:19.077
That's it

34:19.480 --> 34:20.150
Alright...

34:20.400 --> 34:21.879
Plain noodles coming right up

34:22.000 --> 34:23.274
Tell the kitchen: two plain noodles

34:24.280 --> 34:25.554
Two bowls of "nun noodles"

34:26.520 --> 34:28.670
Excuse me Vegi may not be vegi

34:29.440 --> 34:30.873
There's a house rule here

34:31.440 --> 34:33.317
Returning customers use their own chopsticks

34:34.040 --> 34:36.156
New customers use the inn's chopsticks

34:36.639 --> 34:37.833
It's the rule at a 'black inn'

34:38.800 --> 34:39.676
'Black inn'?

34:40.040 --> 34:40.995
What's a 'black inn'?

34:41.719 --> 34:42.516
See?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.433
There've been many fights here

34:44.760 --> 34:46.193
They can't wash out all the blood stains

34:51.480 --> 34:52.230
Innkeeper!

34:53.679 --> 34:54.476
Sir, what's wrong?

34:54.480 --> 34:55.549
Who do you think we are?

34:55.840 --> 34:56.795
You give us white meat?

34:57.280 --> 34:57.871
White meat?

34:58.160 --> 34:59.036
You know the rules!

34:59.280 --> 35:00.235
You think we're new here?

35:00.440 --> 35:02.192
A big mistake!

35:02.680 --> 35:04.079
Ah Dong, change the meat

35:05.240 --> 35:05.752
I'm coming...

35:05.880 --> 35:06.790
What is white meat?

35:06.880 --> 35:08.029
Why are they are so angry?

35:08.800 --> 35:10.358
New customers get white meat

35:12.000 --> 35:12.750
What is it?

35:12.920 --> 35:13.636
Human Flesh

35:14.200 --> 35:16.350
It's from people who used
the inn's chopsticks

35:44.000 --> 35:45.479
Coming through...

35:45.640 --> 35:47.198
Two bowls of...

35:48.040 --> 35:49.075
... "nun noodles"

35:53.080 --> 35:54.911
Sorry, sorry...

35:55.680 --> 35:57.318
Sorry, sorry...

35:57.400 --> 35:58.276
Get back to the kitchen!

35:58.400 --> 35:59.116
You clumsy oaf!

36:04.000 --> 36:04.989
Master Lu Bu...

36:05.280 --> 36:07.077
Please wash your hands, refresh yourself

36:07.800 --> 36:08.437
Have you seen...

36:08.600 --> 36:10.795
... an unfamiliar woman
in the past ten days?

36:11.120 --> 36:12.872
Unfamiliar... Can't say I have

36:14.120 --> 36:15.473
The fact is...

36:16.080 --> 36:18.753
A brother of mine bought
a woman in the capital

36:18.960 --> 36:21.520
He was about to marry her when she ran off

36:21.920 --> 36:22.989
My buddies here...

36:25.000 --> 36:26.433
I shouldn't say buddies...

36:26.880 --> 36:27.869
My brothers here...

36:28.080 --> 36:30.230
They're helping me to track down the bitch

36:30.400 --> 36:32.755
So if you've seen her recently

36:44.000 --> 36:45.069
My lady boss says...

36:45.280 --> 36:48.511
You bastards are forcing women to be whores

36:48.800 --> 36:51.268
You exploit women and call them bitches?

36:51.440 --> 36:52.668
Hard to believe!

38:05.960 --> 38:07.757
Guests, denizens of jianghu
often clash in here

38:07.880 --> 38:08.915
It's normal

38:09.160 --> 38:09.990
You are here often...

38:10.160 --> 38:11.798
So are Master Lu Bu...

38:12.240 --> 38:14.117
... and his friends here

38:14.360 --> 38:15.588
We all get along...

38:15.760 --> 38:17.239
And you're not from the capital

38:17.360 --> 38:20.318
You can't hold any grudges
against each other

38:20.960 --> 38:21.915
It's my fault, I'm a poor host

38:23.000 --> 38:24.274
Have some wine on the house

38:24.600 --> 38:26.397
Give me some face, please?

38:26.840 --> 38:27.636
Damn you!

38:32.400 --> 38:33.515
Damn you!

38:35.720 --> 38:37.551
She did that to test my skill

38:38.280 --> 38:41.033
Next time, I won't let her off so lightly

38:42.400 --> 38:43.196
Listen...

38:43.480 --> 38:44.959
Stop taking in guests for the next two weeks

38:45.080 --> 38:46.195
We will rent the whole inn

38:47.000 --> 38:48.274
But that's impossible, sir!

38:48.760 --> 38:50.273
There's a huge sandstorm on the way

38:50.520 --> 38:52.988
Even we have to shelter
at the courier station

38:53.160 --> 38:56.391
It's too dangerous to stay here, you'll die

38:56.640 --> 38:57.550
A huge sandstorm?

38:58.520 --> 39:00.795
The Dragon Gate black
sandstorm is terrifying

39:01.280 --> 39:03.589
It will bury a large area in sand

39:03.760 --> 39:06.752
It might even blow the inn away, who knows?

39:07.560 --> 39:09.073
Just take the money

39:09.400 --> 39:10.753
I'll decide if I leave or not

39:10.880 --> 39:11.710
I can't take it

39:11.880 --> 39:13.598
Also, I don't dare offend...

39:13.800 --> 39:15.392
... our other party of guests

39:15.640 --> 39:16.629
So you dare offend us?

39:17.120 --> 39:17.996
You're talking nonsense

39:18.440 --> 39:19.077
Sir...

39:19.240 --> 39:21.800
We really can't accept this money

39:21.920 --> 39:23.990
You can't take the whole inn
if they don't leave

39:24.200 --> 39:27.033
I really don't know how to drive them out

39:27.240 --> 39:28.309
Don't worry, innkeeper

39:29.000 --> 39:30.149
If the sandstorm doesn't scare them...

39:30.320 --> 39:31.958
Their lives are cheap

39:32.560 --> 39:34.630
I'll send them to hell early

39:40.720 --> 39:42.233
Again?

39:42.480 --> 39:44.596
Bastard, are you that hungry?

39:47.000 --> 39:48.115
I'm not hungry

39:48.480 --> 39:49.435
Of course you aren't

39:49.880 --> 39:53.350
Not after helping yourself
to a whole leg of lamb!

39:53.720 --> 39:54.948
You're always stealing food

39:55.040 --> 39:55.870
It's safe to eat

39:56.080 --> 39:59.117
If it were human flesh,
they wouldn't argue over it

40:01.600 --> 40:02.271
What?

40:02.560 --> 40:03.709
We just work here, sir!

40:03.840 --> 40:04.909
The innkeeper holds all the money

40:05.280 --> 40:06.554
Please spare us, spare us...

40:07.040 --> 40:09.349
We small fry can't decide anything

40:09.360 --> 40:10.793
You have to talk to...

40:13.000 --> 40:13.989
What is it?

40:14.160 --> 40:15.115
What will it do in the wine?

40:15.240 --> 40:17.834
Dragon Gate Inn turned
"black" three years ago

40:18.160 --> 40:20.310
The woman owner ran away to escape arrest

40:20.920 --> 40:22.638
Do you also oppose the Imperial Court?

40:23.080 --> 40:23.956
That had nothing to do with us

40:24.120 --> 40:26.395
We'd never dare oppose the Imperial Court

40:27.160 --> 40:28.070
Then do what I tell you

40:28.680 --> 40:30.113
I will, I will

40:31.600 --> 40:34.398
Put this in the wine
and serve it to the Tartars

40:35.200 --> 40:36.315
It will kill them

40:36.400 --> 40:37.719
I dare not do that

40:37.840 --> 40:39.239
Sir... Sir!

41:20.080 --> 41:22.071
Great knight, may I ask you something?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.070
It depends what it is

41:23.440 --> 41:25.317
How do you know this place so well?

41:25.560 --> 41:26.913
Have you been here many times?

41:27.760 --> 41:28.875
Are you...

41:30.720 --> 41:32.517
Watch what you say

41:34.000 --> 41:34.989
What do you want to ask?

41:35.800 --> 41:39.156
Are you the woman who fled three years ago?

41:39.320 --> 41:40.753
If I were that woman owner...

41:41.000 --> 41:42.797
The staff would have recognized me

41:43.000 --> 41:43.955
Isn't that so?

41:48.800 --> 41:49.755
Yes, got it

41:52.440 --> 41:53.316
They're here

41:55.760 --> 41:57.432
I found this outside the kitchen

42:10.680 --> 42:12.432
Deputy Chief, the sky looks strange

42:12.880 --> 42:14.632
I think a black sandstorm is really coming

42:15.040 --> 42:17.270
To be safe, we need a contingency plan

42:18.480 --> 42:20.471
His Highness
may have reached the courier station

42:21.320 --> 42:22.594
Tell Lidong to guard the stables

42:22.760 --> 42:23.317
If the need arises...

42:23.720 --> 42:25.756
Keep our horses and set the others free

42:26.240 --> 42:26.956
Yes, sir!

42:30.160 --> 42:32.435
Jinliang, this place is named Dragon Gate...

42:32.600 --> 42:34.989
... after the inscription on two steles

42:35.360 --> 42:36.110
Yes, Your Highness

42:36.600 --> 42:38.397
That's the local legend

42:43.000 --> 42:43.955
Follow each other closely

42:44.880 --> 42:47.075
The caravan ahead, did anybody get strayed?

42:55.240 --> 42:57.276
Open up the barracks! Let them shelter!

42:57.400 --> 42:58.150
Yes!

43:03.160 --> 43:05.390
Riders on the east, this way!

43:05.480 --> 43:06.117
Your Highness,

43:06.400 --> 43:09.119
everyone's coming here for shelter

43:09.480 --> 43:11.630
This place will soon be full

43:12.440 --> 43:15.955
Please order them to stop letting people in

43:17.040 --> 43:18.268
Let them all in

43:20.400 --> 43:21.389
Yes, sir

43:23.560 --> 43:27.075
Your Highness, will Zhao Huai'an come here?

43:27.200 --> 43:29.077
He's a foolhardy man

43:29.680 --> 43:32.194
I can anticipate his every move

43:32.760 --> 43:35.558
Don't make it hard for him to enter

43:35.920 --> 43:38.957
Since I'm here, I'm sure he will come

44:28.360 --> 44:29.918
Sir... Sir!

44:31.760 --> 44:33.591
Deputy Chief, we have searched everywhere

44:33.800 --> 44:34.949
No trace of them

44:36.640 --> 44:38.312
I have men still searching

44:39.920 --> 44:40.557
What is it?

44:43.360 --> 44:44.031
What happened?

45:20.240 --> 45:21.116
Poisoned

45:21.560 --> 45:22.436
How come?

45:23.640 --> 45:27.155
(Tartar)

45:30.120 --> 45:30.916
What did you say?

45:31.160 --> 45:34.118
My boss says, ask your mother how to poison

45:34.240 --> 45:35.878
You can't fool anybody
with these little tricks

45:36.240 --> 45:38.390
You poisoned yourselves by mistake!

45:39.520 --> 45:40.270
Draw your swords!

45:43.920 --> 45:44.716
Innkeeper!

45:45.040 --> 45:46.553
We're too late to cross the border

45:46.720 --> 45:47.550
We need shelter

45:48.080 --> 45:49.149
Your flag's still flying

45:49.240 --> 45:50.275
Why is the door closed?

45:52.160 --> 45:53.593
We're full, go away!

45:53.680 --> 45:54.271
Nonsense!

45:54.960 --> 45:56.029
There's a sandstorm out there!

45:56.680 --> 45:58.989
We can sit on the ceiling
even if you're full

45:59.440 --> 46:00.236
Open the door!

46:00.360 --> 46:01.110
Gangzi, you go!

46:01.240 --> 46:02.593
I don't want to yell from the outside

46:02.720 --> 46:03.470
I'll tell him to leave...

46:04.600 --> 46:06.591
The wind is getting stronger!

46:07.240 --> 46:07.911
Anyone alive inside?

46:08.040 --> 46:09.632
Sir, it's a blessing in disguise

46:09.800 --> 46:12.075
You're lucky that we're full!

46:12.440 --> 46:14.396
Lucky? You buffoon!

46:17.720 --> 46:19.711
You are asking for trouble

46:20.440 --> 46:21.475
You've drawn swords...

46:21.640 --> 46:22.834
... but pretend to be peaceful?

46:23.320 --> 46:24.469
Where are you from?

46:24.840 --> 46:27.479
We're here already.
Would anybody speak to us?

46:40.760 --> 46:42.079
Why would His Highness come here?

46:44.400 --> 46:45.753
Maybe he's a look-alike

46:46.520 --> 46:47.953
He might not be His Highness

46:48.200 --> 46:49.269
Let's find out

46:50.240 --> 46:51.355
My great knights...

46:51.520 --> 46:53.511
You can see that we're full

46:53.720 --> 46:55.233
We really have no room for you

46:55.520 --> 46:58.671
For shelter from the sandstorm,
the best thing...

46:58.880 --> 47:00.916
... would be to go to the courier station

47:01.160 --> 47:03.037
It's much safer, a solid building

47:03.240 --> 47:06.789
And it has plenty of space

47:07.640 --> 47:10.154
(Tartar)

47:11.160 --> 47:11.990
No need to go

47:12.120 --> 47:14.475
Our boss will let the gentleman
have her room

47:14.720 --> 47:16.358
One room, that's ridiculous

47:17.200 --> 47:18.394
If you don't mind...

47:18.920 --> 47:20.876
I can spare two fine rooms for you

47:21.480 --> 47:24.472
(Tartar)

47:24.600 --> 47:26.556
May I invite the gentleman to a drink?

47:27.200 --> 47:28.679
A flash of sword, a taste of wine

47:29.080 --> 47:31.230
We have vintage amber wine here

47:31.360 --> 47:32.918
Something to savor

47:33.120 --> 47:35.873
A wine for real connoisseurs

47:36.000 --> 47:39.549
Please honor me by accepting

47:40.200 --> 47:41.997
Fine, we accept

47:48.840 --> 47:51.115
See if His Highness is
at the courier station

47:55.840 --> 47:58.638
Good sir, do you pass this way often?

48:00.320 --> 48:01.799
You want to know about us?

48:02.120 --> 48:03.189
If it's a rule of jianghu...

48:03.400 --> 48:04.150
... to make inquiries...

48:04.320 --> 48:06.436
Maybe you tell me why you drew swords?

48:06.640 --> 48:07.914
I am talking to this gentleman

48:08.480 --> 48:11.153
It's none of your business

48:11.720 --> 48:14.996
But I am also talking to you now

48:15.160 --> 48:16.115
Why it isn't my business?

48:21.080 --> 48:22.559
I see, what you really want...

48:23.360 --> 48:24.634
... is to know why I'm here

48:25.200 --> 48:25.871
Right?

48:27.040 --> 48:28.268
No need to answer now

48:29.240 --> 48:31.037
Sir, on your way here...

48:31.840 --> 48:33.876
Was this lady knight your only companion?

48:34.880 --> 48:36.393
Are you by any chance bandits?

48:36.880 --> 48:39.155
Are you assessing us before robbing?

48:39.440 --> 48:40.589
Such impudence! Where did you come from?

48:40.800 --> 48:41.869
That's how you speak to us?

48:42.280 --> 48:44.111
Then where are you from?

48:44.640 --> 48:46.198
How dare you speak like that?

48:46.560 --> 48:47.117
Jianzong

48:48.600 --> 48:49.430
How about this...

48:50.480 --> 48:51.595
I'd like to toast this gentleman

48:52.760 --> 48:54.079
Please excuse us...

48:54.520 --> 48:55.509
... for being rude

48:55.880 --> 48:57.029
Hope you wouldn't mind

48:57.480 --> 48:58.356
For your good health

48:59.800 --> 49:00.869
Please drink

49:05.440 --> 49:06.998
Did you poison the wine?

49:08.280 --> 49:10.635
Impossible! How could it be poisoned?

49:10.920 --> 49:12.512
The man you carried out just now...

49:12.640 --> 49:13.629
... seemed poisoned

49:14.000 --> 49:14.989
There's no poison in the wine?

49:18.000 --> 49:18.989
Then you drink it

49:24.200 --> 49:25.076
Come on!

49:25.640 --> 49:26.629
Drink it!

49:26.920 --> 49:27.909
Come on, drink it!

49:31.400 --> 49:33.277
It's getting fiery, what next?

49:37.920 --> 49:41.435
(Tartar)

49:41.600 --> 49:42.749
It's not only the wine...

49:42.920 --> 49:43.875
Everything there is poisoned

49:44.400 --> 49:46.630
If you don't want to be poisoned,
come drink here

49:47.040 --> 49:48.553
No poison over there, but plenty here!

49:48.800 --> 49:49.516
What's going on here?

50:01.360 --> 50:03.396
(Tartar) I like you

50:03.880 --> 50:05.950
(Tartar) It's embarrassing to translate

50:06.040 --> 50:06.677
(Tartar) Do it!

50:07.120 --> 50:09.475
Our boss says I like you a lot

50:09.600 --> 50:11.272
No, she's the one who likes you a lot

50:11.960 --> 50:14.918
(Tartar)

50:15.080 --> 50:17.196
Our boss invites you to her room for a drink

50:17.640 --> 50:19.790
It's quieter there, no disturbances

50:22.560 --> 50:24.551
The smell here is nauseating

50:24.800 --> 50:26.597
Innkeeper, bring me water for washing

50:27.200 --> 50:27.791
I'll vomit...

50:28.400 --> 50:29.515
... if I don't wash off the stench

50:29.720 --> 50:30.869
Yes, ma'am

50:31.760 --> 50:34.558
The rooms are ready, this way

50:35.480 --> 50:39.439
Brother, my room is yours, at your disposal

50:40.000 --> 50:40.637
Alright!

50:40.760 --> 50:42.830
You are so hot, it's hard to refuse

50:43.840 --> 50:47.594
But I need to check them out first

50:47.760 --> 50:48.476
See you

50:59.080 --> 50:59.830
Your Highness...

51:00.280 --> 51:01.190
We've brought the steles

51:01.440 --> 51:03.317
from Black Water City

51:04.240 --> 51:05.593
What does the inscription read?

51:06.040 --> 51:08.349
Your Highness,
the inscription is in Xixia characters

51:08.520 --> 51:10.192
After years of wind and sand erosion...

51:10.760 --> 51:13.513
Only four words are legible:
dragon, gate, fly, cycle

51:13.760 --> 51:16.035
The rest cannot be read

51:16.440 --> 51:19.159
But I must report something
more to Your Highness

51:19.360 --> 51:20.998
Ever since the two steles were unearthed...

51:21.200 --> 51:23.270
They have been regarded as inauspicious

51:23.680 --> 51:25.159
Dragon Gate weathers sandstorms all year

51:25.480 --> 51:27.436
Legend has it that
they're related to the steles

51:28.160 --> 51:30.594
Recently, the weather has been very strange

51:30.880 --> 51:32.711
Now that His Highness
has seen the inscription...

51:33.880 --> 51:35.996
We should return the steles
to their position

51:36.160 --> 51:39.550
Then the world will be set to rights

51:48.880 --> 51:50.233
We are just coolies

51:50.840 --> 51:52.592
Please spare our lives

51:53.560 --> 51:55.198
We don't know anything

52:01.280 --> 52:02.872
Please spare our lives

52:03.920 --> 52:06.036
We will put the steles back

52:08.840 --> 52:10.831
My intention...

52:12.280 --> 52:14.032
... was to lure out the snake

52:14.280 --> 52:16.236
Now you have startled it
by beating the grass

52:16.640 --> 52:17.390
Your Highness...

52:18.280 --> 52:20.748
The coolie wore the same shoes
as Zhao Huai'an

52:21.640 --> 52:23.198
We cast an escape-proof net

52:23.520 --> 52:25.795
And all it took to break
it was a pair of shoes

52:26.320 --> 52:28.470
The sword will draw
more blood before it's sheathed

52:29.200 --> 52:31.111
Turn this place upside down to find Zhao

52:31.240 --> 52:32.195
Yes, Your Highness

52:32.360 --> 52:33.349
Search the station!

52:38.560 --> 52:39.356
And the stockroom

52:40.920 --> 52:42.751
Bring the caravans to the east wing

52:43.040 --> 52:43.597
Sir!

52:49.960 --> 52:50.756
Harness that horse!

52:50.880 --> 52:51.437
Sir!

52:56.280 --> 52:57.030
Chase!

53:08.040 --> 53:08.870
What's the matter?

53:09.400 --> 53:10.674
Does he really resemble me?

53:11.240 --> 53:11.990
Your Highness

53:12.560 --> 53:14.516
At first glance, the resemblance is striking

53:14.720 --> 53:17.473
But his behavior is flippant and skittish

53:17.600 --> 53:20.160
Nothing like Your Highness's
majestic demeanor

53:22.120 --> 53:23.109
He could be useful

53:23.760 --> 53:25.671
We can use him to win by stealth

53:26.320 --> 53:28.629
Go back and tell Tan Luzi to take no action

53:28.880 --> 53:30.871
Wait for my order

53:31.040 --> 53:32.519
We'll lure our enemy into a trap

53:32.720 --> 53:34.278
What trap, Your Highness?

53:35.280 --> 53:37.635
We will deploy a fake.
I'll disguise as him...

53:38.160 --> 53:39.798
... to draw them out

53:41.480 --> 53:42.549
An excellent plan!

53:43.280 --> 53:45.669
It would be prudent
to alert us to your arrival

53:45.960 --> 53:47.552
So that we can tell the real from the fake

53:47.800 --> 53:50.268
We cannot afford to make a mistake

53:52.680 --> 53:53.829
Let's use a password

53:55.080 --> 53:56.035
The password is...

53:58.360 --> 53:59.713
"Dragon Gate fly cycle"

54:00.560 --> 54:02.869
"Dragon Gate... fly cycle"?

54:03.840 --> 54:04.989
And the response is...

54:05.520 --> 54:06.873
"Fake or genuine"

54:07.720 --> 54:09.153
"Fake or genuine"

54:10.640 --> 54:12.437
You must remember this secret password

54:14.280 --> 54:17.272
If you can't, I'll carve it on your chest

54:17.440 --> 54:18.998
I have it memorized... I have it memorized

54:20.960 --> 54:25.556
"Dragon Gate fly cycle", "Fake or genuine"

54:54.640 --> 54:57.074
Is someone on guard
while you three are down here?

54:58.800 --> 54:59.755
Everything is in order

55:00.120 --> 55:02.236
The Tartars are watching them
in the dining room

55:04.000 --> 55:05.638
Boss, everyone is here

55:10.040 --> 55:10.916
Sit down!

55:11.680 --> 55:13.910
I'll start by introducing
the members of our team

55:14.600 --> 55:16.795
Our coordinator is Liang Cai,
the "Shuoyang Demon"

55:17.480 --> 55:21.393
Huang, Er Cai and Xinping
are from Mt. Pingding...

55:22.080 --> 55:24.355
Our guide is Pu Cangzhou

55:24.840 --> 55:25.989
Also known as "The Wind Blade"

55:27.120 --> 55:28.473
He was the one who set us on this trail

55:29.760 --> 55:30.829
And...

55:31.000 --> 55:32.831
We also have Chang Xiaowen,
the "Grim Reaper"

55:33.480 --> 55:35.471
And her Tartar brothers

55:36.760 --> 55:38.637
And my assistant, H'Gantga

55:39.720 --> 55:41.756
300 years ago, this place, Dragon Gate...

55:42.080 --> 55:44.435
... was the capital of the Xixia Empire

55:44.840 --> 55:46.592
The Mongols... At that time...

55:46.800 --> 55:49.519
The Mongols besieged
Black Water City for a year

55:49.720 --> 55:52.473
Finally only 108 warriors
were left in the city

55:52.800 --> 55:53.710
Before they died...

55:53.880 --> 55:57.873
They locked their women,
children and gold in the palace

55:57.960 --> 55:58.790
Then they kill themselves for their country

55:59.440 --> 56:02.193
That night, Black Water City
was buried by a sandstorm

56:03.320 --> 56:04.196
The full inscription on the steles...

56:04.320 --> 56:05.594
... should be read in reverse, giving us...

56:06.160 --> 56:07.673
"Come / Cycle / Fly / Swirl / Dragon"

56:07.840 --> 56:09.319
"Sand / Sea / Dedicate / God / Gate"

56:09.800 --> 56:11.870
"Come Cycle " indicates a cycle of 60 years

56:12.680 --> 56:14.477
Fly Swirl Dragon is the black sandstorm

56:14.960 --> 56:17.679
"God Gate" is the entrance
of the Xixia Palace

56:18.280 --> 56:21.033
The black sandstorm
will raise the "Sand Sea"...

56:21.320 --> 56:24.039
... to reveal the buried palace

56:24.720 --> 56:28.030
That will give us access to the treasure

56:28.760 --> 56:30.432
Those at Dragon Gate Inn in the past...

56:30.640 --> 56:31.789
... were waiting for the treasure
to come to light

56:32.560 --> 56:33.754
But events took an unfortunate turn

56:34.240 --> 56:35.559
The inn owner was a woman

56:35.960 --> 56:37.598
Provoked by a man, she burned down the inn

56:38.240 --> 56:39.559
No-one has seen her since

56:40.480 --> 56:42.072
Her name was Ling Yanqiu

56:42.840 --> 56:43.670
So you're...

56:44.080 --> 56:45.149
Listen, all of you

56:45.320 --> 56:47.038
The ancient city is filled with mazes

56:47.320 --> 56:48.958
This map shows the way out

56:49.320 --> 56:49.877
The way out?

56:50.800 --> 56:52.119
Why the way out and not the way in?

56:52.800 --> 56:54.028
Because there's only one way in

56:54.280 --> 56:55.838
You have to get through the mazes
on the way out

56:56.360 --> 56:57.998
You can get in without the map, but not out

57:00.720 --> 57:03.359
Cai, what's going on upstairs at the moment?

57:03.920 --> 57:05.751
Why is the inn full of soldiers in disguise?

57:06.520 --> 57:08.715
They say they're looking for a woman

57:09.920 --> 57:11.751
"Wind Blade," what do you know about it?

57:12.680 --> 57:14.716
Apparently West Bureau
wants to execute someone

57:15.400 --> 57:18.870
They're after a maid
who escaped from the palace

57:19.880 --> 57:22.075
I saw two women here today

57:22.400 --> 57:24.038
But they disappeared
when the soldiers arrived

57:24.200 --> 57:25.519
They used their own chopsticks

57:26.400 --> 57:27.549
Even if they're our peers...

57:28.320 --> 57:30.675
Woe betide them if they get in our way

57:31.360 --> 57:33.032
It's our only chance in 60 years

57:33.400 --> 57:35.038
We'd better grab it

57:35.280 --> 57:36.395
The Jade Emperor himself couldn't stop me!

57:37.800 --> 57:40.314
The soldiers seemed
cowed by "Wind Blade" earlier

57:40.600 --> 57:42.795
Did they mistake you for someone else?

57:44.760 --> 57:47.194
Their boss invited you to his room

57:51.080 --> 57:53.116
It was just talk No

57:53.320 --> 57:54.958
They have set everything on the table...

57:55.680 --> 57:57.238
Why don't you go to check them out?

57:57.680 --> 57:59.432
I'll go with you I won't go!

57:59.440 --> 58:00.429
You fought against them earlier

58:01.160 --> 58:03.435
You can't go

58:03.600 --> 58:05.033
Then I'll go with him No better...

58:05.360 --> 58:08.193
Their boss drew his sword against you

58:08.720 --> 58:10.517
Then there's no-one suitable

58:10.960 --> 58:13.349
"Mr Wind," you'll just have to go alone

58:14.400 --> 58:16.356
Alone? What if something happens?

58:17.200 --> 58:18.553
With a name like "Wind Blade"...

58:18.880 --> 58:20.757
You must have some martial skills

58:21.440 --> 58:23.237
And that means I don't need any help?

58:23.600 --> 58:26.797
Of course not,
if you get into trouble, just yell

58:26.960 --> 58:29.474
We'll all rush in to save you

58:29.640 --> 58:30.470
Isn't that right?

58:32.240 --> 58:34.754
And with a mouth like yours,
I'm sure you can yell

58:35.600 --> 58:37.591
Nothing will happen, don't worry

58:41.840 --> 58:42.750
One other thing, "Mr Wind"...

58:43.000 --> 58:45.434
They seem to think
you're a high-ranking officer

58:45.560 --> 58:47.551
You can show superiority
when you speak to them

58:51.280 --> 58:52.269
Easy to say

58:54.440 --> 58:55.998
Deputy Chief, he's here

59:05.640 --> 59:06.516
I ordered discretion...

59:06.640 --> 59:08.278
But you've made yourselves obvious

59:08.520 --> 59:10.272
Even a halfwit could see
that you're officials

59:11.480 --> 59:12.117
Yes

59:14.080 --> 59:15.479
Anything to report? Tell me

59:16.080 --> 59:17.149
Everything is under control

59:17.920 --> 59:20.036
We await Your Highness's orders

59:22.040 --> 59:23.439
Everything's under control...

59:25.960 --> 59:27.518
Then why would you need orders?

59:27.880 --> 59:29.313
It's chaos! How can order be restored?

59:30.160 --> 59:31.195
Your Highness, please keep calm...

59:31.600 --> 59:33.079
Your inferiors don't understand

59:33.240 --> 59:35.515
What do you mean by chaos?

59:37.160 --> 59:38.149
Maybe Your Highness...

59:38.640 --> 59:40.312
... go over the plan again

59:41.040 --> 59:42.359
Be careful upstairs

59:44.440 --> 59:45.555
Oh yes, Cai...

59:46.640 --> 59:47.993
When you rebuilt the inn...

59:48.560 --> 59:49.629
Besides this cellar...

59:50.080 --> 59:51.638
Did you find any other tunnels?

59:52.400 --> 59:53.549
This is how we found it

59:53.800 --> 59:55.916
I didn't see any tunnels

59:56.080 --> 59:57.559
Rumor has it that the woman boss...

59:57.760 --> 59:58.510
Ling Yanqiu...

59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.077
... dug tunnels and laid traps

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.193
I think this isn't the only cellar

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.317
Maybe...

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.358
... the two women we saw
are hiding beneath us

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:23.997
Cai!

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.076
Xinping!

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.595
Er Cai!

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.788
Where are you?

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:45.910
It's her!

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.431
She's one of the women we saw

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.310
There was another one

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.639
How do you plan to detain me?

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.278
The only one who knows
these caves so well...

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.076
... is the woman who ran Dragon Gate Inn...

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.515
Ling Yanqiu

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.633
Your Highness, please say it once again

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.952
What is your plan?

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.309
What kind of place is Dragon Gate Inn?

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.914
Have you checked the staff's background?

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.474
What's the business of those Tartars?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.477
Do you still remember what rank you hold?

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.073
And why you were sent here?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:55.910
Tell me

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.271
Third in West Bureau, Seventh in the palace

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.590
Absurd!

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.719
Do I need you to tell me that?

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.670
I want to know...

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.117
If you remember...

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.196
... the reason you are here!

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.478
Of course I do

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.753
If I have not performed well...

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.759
Please let me atone by doing better

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.429
How?

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.190
Ordered to give poison, you get poisoned!

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.591
The woman you're looking
for got here long ago!

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.358
But all you do is wait, wait, wait...

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.316
... up here in your room

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.633
Are you waiting for me to do your job?

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.396
You were after
the treasure last time you were here

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.790
But the officials tracked you down

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.389
So you had to flee

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.472
Now you're here with a palace maid...

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.233
You want the same again?

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.552
You drew the officials here to deal with us?

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.119
Have you ever thought...

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.790
... I could bargain
with those corrupt officials?

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.152
I can hand over the maid to them

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.915
And when they leave...

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.310
The treasure will still be ours

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.430
Tell me...

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.798
How will you deal
with the people here in the inn?

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.512
We'll poison their animals and...

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.832
... leave them stranded here to die

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.799
The sandstorm will bury the corpses

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.798
None of them will escape

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.196
Just be sure that our quarry is amongst them

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.512
Why wait for the sandstorm, we could act now

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.076
Kill them all at daybreak

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.198
Then we can take our time...

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.390
... tracking our quarry

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.516
Sir!

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:24.871
Who is it?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.956
Zhao Tong, back from the courier station

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.671
Your Highness, are you going alone?

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.790
Yes

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:46.995
Your Highness

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.269
Wind Blade!

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.749
You're the Wind Blade

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.356
You trade jianghu news, we've done business

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.196
I was wanted by the Imperial Court,
Zhao Huai'an

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.709
Remember me?

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.195
What now?

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.516
You've been recognized

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.949
Don't Fight!

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:15.876
What happened?

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.436
Who is he?

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.872
I've waited so long to see you again

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.309
For three years...

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.200
I've pondered the size of the jianghu

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.548
It seems infinite,
and I've worried for your safety

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.756
Three years ago,
I picked up the love token you left

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.795
Now, I can return it...

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.714
As selfish as every other man in the world

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:07.436
And that's my fault?

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.429
Shut up!

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.793
We agreed when we broke up...

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.433
To talk business only!

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:13.271
You now regret it?

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.029
I'm getting the punishment in early,
to forestall you

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:21.234
I'll put this into my books

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.555
Record in books... could you?

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.839
If you didn't want to see her

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.158
Why did you come here?

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.714
I followed the West Bureau men here

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.154
I had no idea I'd bump into "Wind Blade"

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.188
They were taken in by his resemblance...

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.273
... to their Boss, Yu Huatian

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.069
Their Boss?

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:11.795
Yu Huatian is in the courier station,
50 li from here

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.995
He will send his cavalry here

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.435
When they arrive...

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.036
No-one here will stand a chance

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.550
You must be kidding

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.673
He's your enemy...

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.836
But he'd kill us?

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:24.435
Why would he do that?

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.675
You think Yu Huatian would let go...

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.671
... a man who resembles him that much...

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.116
... to roam around freely?

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.551
Worse, "Wind Blade" posed as Yu...

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.629
... and tricked his subordinates

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.591
If they turned a blind eye to that...

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.273
They wouldn't be the West Bureau

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.629
I think Yu Huatian will move at dawn

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:51.868
We should move first

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.719
Catch him unawares

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.438
Our first step is to divide the enemy

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.473
One of their guides was poisoned

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.750
Let's start with him

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.036
Lu Bu, I'm here to save you

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.038
This is the antidote to the poison you drank

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.271
The Imperial Court is done with you

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.516
They won't even bury you if you die

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.029
If you still want to live,
do one thing for me

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.834
I can't... fight

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.434
You don't need to. I'm in love with my boss

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.913
But she only has eyes for that gentleman

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.479
Kill him for me

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.712
I can barely speak, how can I kill?

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.030
Go to the stables...

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.350
... and set all the horses loose

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.396
When the sandstorm hits, he will be trapped

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.039
He's sure to die here

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.035
You're healthy...
but you won't do it yourself

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.079
It must be a trap

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.039
I can't do it because she might see me

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.309
And where would that leave me?

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.756
So it's your life for his

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.315
Your choice

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.994
This is only half of the antidote

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.031
If you don't go along with my request...

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.475
You'll still die in three days

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.836
For three years...

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.511
You carried what I most craved

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.318
You searched high and low to find me

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.912
But fate doomed you...

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.831
... to disappointment

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.592
Although you never appeared...

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.390
I felt in my heart that
you were looking at me

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.478
The reason I carried the flute...

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.597
... is because I envied its owner

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.352
She was long gone...

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.192
But she was always in your heart

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.111
She gave her life for me

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.956
That's a debt I can never repay

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.078
I understand, you didn't see me...

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.031
... because you thought I might cling to you

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.234
"Better lost in jianghu
than caught up in the world"

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.029
I've never understood that saying

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.111
Partings are hard, both in life and in death

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.032
Those close to me have left, one by one

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.313
One day, I will leave too and...

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.072
... it'd be better
if I won't give anybody sorrow

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.548
I have a wish too

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.391
This flute is for you

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.831
Carry it away from this blood-soaked place

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.514
Turn away and never come back

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:50.876
Why are you hitting me?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.718
The next step is yours, we count on you

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.635
I have medicine for her wound

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.231
I can help you with your wish

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.517
Only when a woman's heart dies...

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.233
... can she leave you

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.197
That's her only way out

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.516
I want to ask you...

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.229
Why did you burn down the inn
for him back then?

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.075
Actually I...

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.230
I'm tired of this desert

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.314
Are you really leaving?

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.278
Stay, join us in the treasure-hunt

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.352
There's no place for 'love' in jianghu

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.954
Take me!

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.191
I talk business, not 'love'

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.676
With money, what can't be bought?

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.153
I used to think like that

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.075
But if something doesn't belong to you...

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.389
You can't have it or buy it

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.794
If I can't buy it, I don't care

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.394
You'll understand one day

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.195
And you'll change your mind

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.750
I know it's my fault...

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.908
... but take me with you

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.157
Don't think that you two fooled me

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.313
You and he aren't like that

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.435
If you wanted me to leave,
you're trying too hard

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.991
Then... take me with you

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.915
In case of danger, hide yourself well

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.794
If that doesn't work...

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.676
Find a good family in your next life

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.069
Then where are you going?

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.471
I could go anywhere for him

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.475
If I stayed, he'd be worried

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.549
Deputy Chief, His Highness wants to see you

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.478
"Dragon Gate fly cycle"

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.635
What?

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.394
A slip of the tongue

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.869
What does Your Highness wish?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.751
When you arrived, did you use a guide...

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.955
... named Lu Bu?

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.871
We did, what about him?

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.639
This man's been bribed

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.838
He is in the stables now,
freeing your horses

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.600
He aims to trap you in the sandstorm...

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.352
... so that you will all die here

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.113
Xueyong, check the stables!

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:11.870
Sir!

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.868
Weren't you weakened by the poison?

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.156
Where did you find
the strength to go to the stables?

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.315
I...

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.476
I...

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.393
Interesting, you've cured yourself

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.438
It seems you can withstand any poison

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.109
Zhao Tong! Sir!

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.713
Bring him more poison

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.394
Let's see how he does it

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.870
Officer... Officer...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.036
I am not immune to poison

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.470
Someone gave me an antidote

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.828
But I only took half of it...

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.916
So I'm still half-poisoned

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.109
Go on

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.753
I was given the antidote...

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.630
... by that giant called H'Gantga

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:13.638
He...

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:16.637
He...

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.997
He likes his woman boss...

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.031
And he wants his rival laid low

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.553
He gave me the antidote...

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.794
... and told me...

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.671
... which horses to free

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.076
Report!

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:40.999
Two groups are fighting downstairs

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.429
The Tartar woman and
another woman started it

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.879
Apparently they're fighting over a man

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.479
Now they've started a fire

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.755
Even if it's a trick,
we shouldn't stay inside the inn

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.234
Let's see what happens

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.558
Tell everyone to go outside and stand by

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.396
Quick, all of you! There's another box

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.399
I've got it, Cai

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.396
There're some here too

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.870
Get it outside, then empty the next room

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:32.716
Quick!

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.554
What else needs to be moved?

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:38.996
Go!

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.155
It's a trick, nothing's burning

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.349
Zhao Tong, Ji Xueyong!

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.078
Take some men to investigate...

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:47.757
See what's going on

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.636
Sir!

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.671
Pingzi, take your men that way

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.116
The sky color is really strange

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.509
Daqiang, check the kitchen

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.749
Pingzi, check the stables

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.598
The rest of you, check downstairs

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.274
They're our men, from West Bureau

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.035
Are they real or impostors?

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.949
Very suspicious

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.909
What's our password?

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.189
The first half is "Dragon Gate fly cycle"

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.038
The second half is "Fake or genuine"

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.394
"Dragon Gate fly cycle"!

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.357
Quick, all of you! There's another box

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.874
I've got it, Cai

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.752
There're some here too Get them outside!

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.153
"Dragon Gate fly cycle"

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.389
What are you thinking?

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.799
"Dragon Gate fly cycle" must be a password

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.513
"Fake or genuine"

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.633
Fake... "Fake or genuine"

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.958
Officer, why are you deployed out here?

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:28.956
Your Highness...

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.158
We were told the inn was on fire

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.076
We suspect a trick...

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.430
Men are investigating now

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.756
How do you assess the situation?

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.473
No-one has reported yet

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.758
You've been lured away from your position!

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.229
Have they left by the back way...

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.435
... while you wait out here?

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.276
Yes, Your Highness!

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:47.671
Follow them!

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.350
Deputy Chief, the customers have all gone

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.191
We found twitch grass covering tinder

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.634
That was what made the smoke

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.870
That's bad, they did trick us outside

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:16.877
Report to His Highness!

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.639
There are ambushers outside! Be alert!

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.389
Ambushers! Be alert!

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.594
Have the men outside been tricked too?

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:36.870
Let me try the password

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.111
Quick!

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.670
"Dragon Gate fly cycle"!

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.271
What?

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.994
"Dragon Gate fly cycle"!

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:47.876
Shoot!

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.109
Damn you!

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.034
They're nearly here, one away...

01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.553
I waited until
they were close before rushing back

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.556
Good timing

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:02.750
Ready!

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.037
Deputy Chief, we've discovered that...

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.037
... our uniforms have been stolen

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.472
Then His Highness outside is an impostor?

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.913
"Dragon Gate fly cycle"

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.669
Come again?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:17.716
Cycle?

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.316
The hell with it! Arrows!

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.349
It's time, let's move!

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.830
Four groups, using the inn's location...

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:06.711
... and the wind direction

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.954
First group, Cai

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.913
You take the best vantage point

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.878
Follow the movements of Yu Huatian

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.151
Use signals to inform us

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.750
Second group, Chang Xiaowen and H'Gantga

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.829
Lead your men in an attack...

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.473
... from the south of the inn

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.875
Make them use up their weapons and men

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.750
Third group, Gu Shaotang

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.274
You lead the inn staff...

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.999
... in a pincer movement

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.276
Respond to Chang Xiaowen...

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.357
Arget their martial arts masters

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.999
Mind the one in a black mask...

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.879
His twin swords are lethal

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.555
Fourth group!

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.030
Draw out Yu Huatian and lead him to me

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.439
Why've you come back? To help you

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.470
That bowman is covering us, ready to attack

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.159
We have to stop him somehow

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.232
Yu Huatian is over there, I'm going

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.635
No!

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.035
You take care of the bowman

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.910
I'll deal with Yu Huatian

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.436
You'll fight him?

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.476
You alone?

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.356
Yes

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.433
Alone, that's it

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:55.916
That's it?

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.989
H'Gantga, this is it!

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.958
The flying swirl dragon!

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.638
You and I are fire and ice

01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.436
Yu Huatian...

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.600
You dare to fight me
inside the swirling dragon?

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.873
Listen, mount your steed if you dare!

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.310
I'll be waiting!

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.470
Zhao Huai'an!

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.232
Zhao Huai'an!

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:28.950
H'Gantga!

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.629
It's coming!

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:34.029
Quick, into the tunnel

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.155
Zhao Huai'an!

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:16.913
Zhao Huai'an!

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:23.789
Zhao Huai'an!

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:26.792
Zhao Huai'an!

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.355
There's a light ahead

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:41.037
It's a reflection!
The gold roof of the palace!

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.390
We've found the Xixia treasure at last!

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.671
I won't leave you behind

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.154
What is it? Zhao Huai'an

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:44.916
Zhao Huai'an

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.309
Are you alright?

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.153
Yanqiu, the dagger he's holding
is ultra-sharp

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.715
Take great care

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:53.117
That's the West...

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.476
Head of West Bureau, Yu Huatian!

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.476
I'll tackle him

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.351
Wait

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:05.910
Stay put

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.872
I know his fighting style already

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.189
Stay back and watch...

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.199
Note his weak points

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:17.192
One palace maid attracts so much scum!

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.193
Not to mention you, you worthless face-thief

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:21.952
You dare to impersonate me?

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.718
You're the worst of all

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.829
Enough talk yet?

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.110
Scum we may be, but we are many now

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.514
We'll suffocate you!

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:36.715
Give way!

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.712
Are numbers an advantage?

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.591
The more people, the more need for strategy

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.149
Who will you sacrifice first?

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.515
All you officials...

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:54.953
Aren't you all greedy?

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.155
Everyone knows what you're really like

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.036
There's enough gold here
to set you up for life

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.475
No more worries about your twilight years

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.989
No more jockeying for rank and advantage

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.956
Your world is a bear-pit, mull it over!

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.075
Good...

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.510
You echo my thoughts exactly

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:15.949
Good thinking!

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.718
What a shame that...

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.311
... none of you is a match for me

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.915
I can finish off all of you

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.232
And I'll end up with all the gold anyway!

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:31.399
You know why no-one could find this capital?

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.674
Because another sandstorm is on the way

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:37.872
This city will be buried under the sand

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.429
On your own, how much gold could you move?

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:44.596
This stalemate
will cost our lives and the gold

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.479
Neither side has the advantage

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.998
So we have mutual interests!

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.475
But some are not here for the gold

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.398
They want to fight me to the death

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.916
Where does that leave your plan?

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:00.109
Here's an idea: we team up together...

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.639
... to finish off those two

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:04.075
How about it?

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.555
Honeyed words!

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.998
Outside here,
wealth won't be his first priority

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.233
Didn't he call you "scum"...

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.833
... and "face-thief"?

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:15.870
Look at him

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.714
He's the one between you and the gold...

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.710
Not me

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.871
It's a shame that
you're at such a disadvantage

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:23.155
Maybe I can't get rich...

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.035
But you would die anyway

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.239
If you could persuade him...

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.433
We might still have time to move the gold

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.793
These people all came to get rich...

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.798
This damned official wants to divide us

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.678
He'll easily sway them

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.028
They could turn against us

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.079
If you want gold too...

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:45.355
Stop wasting time on talk!

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:48.190
Yu Huatian, I can cut a deal with you

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.834
Let's all move the gold out

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.829
If you agree, let Gu Shaotang go

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.075
What kind of deal is that?

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.834
There are many of you...

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:58.199
How would we move the gold?

01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.191
Stupid question

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.588
We all carry what we can

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.592
The strongest gets the most!

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.918
That would put me at a big disadvantage

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.756
Fending you off and carrying my gold

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.988
I couldn't move much

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.474
Why would I agree to such a plan?

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:15.313
I know you're greedy...

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.589
But you're too cautious

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.355
The gold can't all be moved at once...

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.838
To reassure everyone...

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.318
I suggest each group monitors the other two

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.356
Yu Huatian...

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.589
... Gu Shaotang and I will stay here

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:32.356
The others move the gold

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:33.795
If we stay...

01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.236
Those who carry gold will have to return

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:38.154
Any other concerns?

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.436
Alright... that makes sense

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.039
Once you're outside, don't come back

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.916
You intend to perish with him?

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.835
We've walked so far, where's the way out?

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:00.869
Is this the wrong way?

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.630
No, I'm following the map

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.471
The ways in and out are different

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.355
We're nearly there

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.590
Have you thought it through?

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.636
Do we really go back for them?

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.910
You're ready to abandon Gu Shaotang?

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.789
The world is ours once we get out

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.229
If we go back...

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.193
Maybe none of us will survive

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:25.908
Here! That's the way out

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:27.429
I'll take a look

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.275
Move the gold up here

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:40.677
A bit higher...

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:41.837
Got it

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.872
Let's get back for another round

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.117
What the...?

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.236
She...

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.395
She... has been...

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:00.073
... hiding her true face

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.915
You could have got away

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.391
How come you are going back for him?

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.556
She's an enemy agent

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.154
They tricked us

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.315
You gave me this dagger

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.433
Now reap what you have sown

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.671
With you down, no-one here can match me

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.432
You just gave Zhao Huai'an your sword

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:25.633
So how can you fight me?

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.913
Your martial skills
and schemes can't match mine

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.358
Now I'm going to kill Zhao

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.436
Catch her!

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.229
Wind Blade!

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.190
Here you are! Give chase!

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.349
No further!

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:49.509
There's a trap ahead

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.349
H'Gantga!

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.116
I'll stab you!

01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.713
You hugged that enemy agent...

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.477
Keep your hands off me!

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:01.876
Buludu!

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:04.955
Look ahead, there are tripwires

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:14.749
H'Gantga, what is it?

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.036
It's very sharp, some kind of gold thread

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.358
They're in real danger in there

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:23.874
They won't let us in...

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.716
... in case we warn Zhao

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.032
Great knight...

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.115
What's going on out there?

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.828
It's bad, they're fighting over the gold

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.394
Fighting fiercely

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.309
Follow me!

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.355
Up to the roof

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.509
It's hopeless, they're already fighting

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.717
Why are we three staying here?

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.116
Zhao Huai'an...

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:51.191
We just agreed a deal

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.433
Isn't it time to renegotiate?

01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.830
H'Gantga!

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.709
It's a danger signal

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.552
You're supposed to fear Yu Huatian...

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.110
But that didn't stop you coming back?

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:31.279
Why did I come back?

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.756
I came to help Ling Yanqiu...

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.835
... to kill you, you fickle man!

01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:57.676
What's that horrible sound?

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:01.793
The sound of people in love
with power and gold

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.754
Sadly, it all returns to dust and ashes

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.474
Even if you wait a lifetime,
the end is the same

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.797
Death is inevitable!

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.316
Your Highness, the wind is back, let's go

01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:19.917
Almost there Yes

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.352
Give way and let me do it

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.431
Come on

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:45.989
This way will be quicker!

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:46.751
Good

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.313
You really think I made you stay...

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.472
... because of the gold?

01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.670
Go up first

01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.436
I saw through your decision...

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.119
... to stay here

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:28.758
Mind the places Su passed through!

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.155
There are traps!

01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.992
Behind you! The thread is lethal!

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:50.790
It's you?

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.949
Where is Ling Yanqiu?

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:55.990
Why don't I see her?

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.275
Where is she?

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.075
What happened to her?

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.475
She was badly hurt

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.790
She didn't want you to see her die

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.634
So she left before you revived

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:15.679
I leave with you the things...

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:17.549
... I don't want to take

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:24.075
Partings are natural,
why should we be missed?

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.917
Just tell him I will be free

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.229
That's all

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.912
Which way did she go?

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.789
To the south

01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:58.754
I must see her, I'll look for her!

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.275
Let's go

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.869
Hopeless!

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.759
She gave me the flute

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.276
I'll wait for them here

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.552
Will they come back?

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:40.869
Definitely

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:44.875
One cycle...

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:53.031
60 years is a lifetime

01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:55.760
All our planning led us back to these sands

01:55:58.360 --> 01:55:59.475
I want rank in the government

01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.071
A very powerful government official

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.589
I'll come with you!

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.070
If they don't come back...

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:20.636
... come find me in the capital

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:22.670
I'll expect you

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.030
Come here, treasure of my heart

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:05.029
Kill her

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:07.835
Who?

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:13.670
Understood

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:24.715
Your Ladyship...

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:25.994
Guards!

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.310
Send the Imperial doctor!

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:29.875
Her ladyship died!

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.277
In the 23rd year of Chenghua's reign...

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.839
Concubine Wan Zhen'er...

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.148
... fell ill and died suddenly

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.515
Palace records say...

01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:40.074
... she contracted a liver disease

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:41.474
And died of sudden liver failure

01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.711
