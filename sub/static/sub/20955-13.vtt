00:02.770 --> 00:03.871
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.904 --> 00:06.407
Guero said you can help me.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.575
(kisses)

00:07.608 --> 00:09.143
EPIFANIO: I'm sorry, Teresa.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.312
I said, stop the car!
(gun fires)

00:11.345 --> 00:14.315
(dramatic music broods)

00:14.348 --> 00:15.249
*

00:15.283 --> 00:17.151
(speaking Spanish)

00:17.185 --> 00:19.820
Welcome to America.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.157
EPIFANIO (over phone): That puta
and Guero stole money from me.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.925
If you find this girl,

00:24.958 --> 00:25.993
let me know.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.061
*

00:27.095 --> 00:31.765
CAMILA: (speaking Spanish)

00:31.799 --> 00:33.201
We're the same.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.237
Never go into business
with someone

00:36.270 --> 00:38.172
unless you know what
their weakness is.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.173
What's mine?

00:39.207 --> 00:40.574
CAMILA: Guero.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.576
I just want to be together.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.112
No matter what.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.879
JAMES: You were
right about Guero.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.681
Now you're second-guessing him.
This is messy.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.850
Well then, I clean it up
like I always do.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.585
TERESA: I'm leaving Camila.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.387
I would like to
keep working with both of you.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.789
As long as you have
El Santo's product, you have me.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.025
Remember this,
wherever you go,

00:58.058 --> 00:59.560
whatever you do,

00:59.593 --> 01:01.095
I will hunt you down--
(phone beeps)

01:01.129 --> 01:03.864
*

01:03.897 --> 01:05.599
(gunfire)

01:05.633 --> 01:07.401
POTE: They got Camila.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.936
JAMES: Who got her?
POTE: I don't know.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.372
I didn't break you out of prison
to hurt you.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.740
I received this video.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.542
I'm in trouble.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.943
I've been kidnapped.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.212
Everyone has a right
to the throne,

01:18.246 --> 01:19.313
if they can take it.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.614
You working for Camila?

01:20.648 --> 01:22.150
I was.
She has something of mine.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.751
-I need help taking it back.
-What?

01:23.784 --> 01:25.719
Cocaine.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.221
JAMES: What do you want, Teresa?

01:27.255 --> 01:28.889
Half of the product
from El Santo.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.325
The only thing you'll
get from me is a bullet.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.827
(gunfire)

01:33.861 --> 01:35.329
Where is Camila?

01:35.363 --> 01:36.964
If I had her,
I would have traded her.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.299
(pistol fires)
(grunts)

01:38.332 --> 01:39.733
(shotgun fires)
(groans)

01:39.767 --> 01:41.169
*

01:41.202 --> 01:43.571
You won.
The coke is yours.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.973
Where you go, I go.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.108
(tires screech)

01:48.142 --> 01:49.277
El Santo found me.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.411
I'm late with his payment.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.645
(music intensifies)

01:53.181 --> 01:56.150
(dramatic dirge music)

01:56.184 --> 02:03.191
*

02:06.126 --> 02:09.197
(dogs snarling)

02:09.230 --> 02:12.233
(flesh tearing)
(dogs snarling)

02:18.372 --> 02:23.944
(speaking Spanish)

02:23.977 --> 02:26.247
(speaking Spanish)

02:33.321 --> 02:36.224
(dramatic music pounds)

02:36.257 --> 02:43.264
*

02:51.339 --> 02:52.840
We're supposed to protect her.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.008
Don't you dare
point your finger at me.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.410
You're the one who ran away

02:56.444 --> 02:58.379
and left Isabela
without a mother.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.881
-Really?
-She was heartbroken!

03:00.914 --> 03:03.517
And she filled your absence
with the Jimenez boy.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.386
She wouldn't have met
Kique Jimenez

03:05.419 --> 03:06.654
if you hadn't partnered
up with Boaz.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.021
You broke Boaz out of prison!

03:08.055 --> 03:09.423
Our daughter's
been kidnapped because

03:09.457 --> 03:10.858
you're responsible
for Manuel's death,

03:10.891 --> 03:12.092
whether you pulled the trigger
or not.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.161
You, you killed Manuel

03:14.194 --> 03:16.497
the moment you conspired
with him behind my back.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.198
He was a good man,

03:18.232 --> 03:20.100
but you twisted him like
you did with my lieutenants,

03:20.133 --> 03:21.702
like you tried
to do with Batman.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.103
And now?

03:23.136 --> 03:24.672
Our daughter might die
because of you!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.006
(cries)

03:26.039 --> 03:27.207
(stifled crying)

03:27.241 --> 03:28.709
It's okay.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.578
I'm sorry.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.013
(soft dramatic music)

03:33.046 --> 03:35.048
I'm as scared as you are.

03:35.082 --> 03:41.755
*

03:41.789 --> 03:45.959
We did this to her, you know?

03:45.993 --> 03:48.296
This life,

03:48.329 --> 03:50.931
we brought this on ourselves.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.434
(cell phone rings)

03:53.467 --> 03:55.469
(ringing and buzzing)

03:55.503 --> 03:58.772
It's them.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.574
(ringing continues)

04:00.608 --> 04:01.775
(phone beeps)

04:01.809 --> 04:02.710
Hello?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.212
Where's my money?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.882
I'm prepared to give you
2 million up front,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.918
as a gesture of good faith.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.653
The other 8 will be delivered

04:12.686 --> 04:14.955
when you hand over
my daughter safely.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.157
I'm not trying to negotiate,
old man. Don't fuck with me.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.126
You pay me the whole 10 million
or your daughter dies.

04:19.159 --> 04:19.993
(phone beeps)

04:23.797 --> 04:25.499
We're not accepting
the 2 million.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.736
Epifanio's trying to play me.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.838
My father has an army.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.807
I would take the money
and leave Mexico.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.310
Mexico's my home, princesa.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.512
I plan to die here,
even if I die today.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.781
I want a fair deal.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.851
Epifanio took what I love.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.186
Now I'll take what he loves.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.824
Hello?

04:50.858 --> 04:51.825
CHUCHO:
We just delivered the coke

04:51.859 --> 04:53.026
to Finch's people,

04:53.060 --> 04:54.362
just like you told us to.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.296
We're meeting his couriers now.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.366
Tell Big T we'll
get his payment soon.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.232
CHUCHO: Will do.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.706
That's a lot of backup.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.541
It's $27 million.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.546
POTE: Why is the coke here?

05:12.580 --> 05:15.616
(suspenseful music)

05:15.649 --> 05:22.390
*

05:28.529 --> 05:29.663
(car door opens)

05:36.504 --> 05:39.072
It is out of form
for me to be here.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.376
Things go smoothly,
my presence isn't required.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.478
Things go south,
I have a reliable team

05:44.512 --> 05:45.979
in place to handle it.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.916
I'm here because
I'm disappointed, Teresa.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.984
I had to hear
the answer in person.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.352
Are you desperate enough
to play me

05:52.386 --> 05:53.754
or did someone fuck you?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.658
This is not cocaine.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.993
This is lactose powder.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.662
And that

06:01.695 --> 06:03.397
is somebody trying
to get their head blown off.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.932
There must be
a misunderstanding.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.267
I'll straighten this out
right away.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.671
My judgment is
usually impeccable.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.406
Or maybe I was wrong this time.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.874
Maybe you're not ready for this.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.509
I am.
I'll fix it.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.177
I hope so.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.279
Or our road together ends here.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.787
(truck door clanks shut)

06:29.723 --> 06:31.124
You were right.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.926
The gang stole the coke.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.728
Big T burned us.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.897
Now what, jefa?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.566
We burn him back.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.569
(dramatic music)

06:41.602 --> 06:44.938
*

06:54.482 --> 06:56.650
(Eb Black's "Dale Brinquitos")

06:56.684 --> 06:58.919
*

06:58.952 --> 07:00.387
Hey.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.288
I know you ain't
missed me that much.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.991
Get your ass down.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.392
What the--

07:05.425 --> 07:06.927
I trusted you,
and you stole from us.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.496
What the hell
are you talking about?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.764
Call your uncle,
tell him I have his money

07:10.798 --> 07:13.166
and I want to meet.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.068
I'm not gonna help you
kill my uncle, pendeja.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.670
(gun cocks)

07:16.704 --> 07:17.938
Then you can say good-bye
on the phone.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.573
(soft brooding music)

07:19.607 --> 07:22.175
This is so messed up.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.310
On speaker.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.779
*

07:25.813 --> 07:27.681
(keys clack)
(phone beeps)

07:27.715 --> 07:30.017
(phone rings, beeps)

07:30.050 --> 07:32.152
This better be good,
Traviesita.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.587
I was about to crash out.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.489
It's payday.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.158
I'm with Teresa; they want to
know where you want to meet.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.927
The old amusement park.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.962
(over phone)
South side of D-Town.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.597
One hour.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.798
I'll let 'em know.
(phone beeps)

07:44.832 --> 07:47.367
*

07:47.400 --> 07:48.368
Let's go.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.804
(music builds)

07:50.838 --> 07:52.372
*

07:52.405 --> 07:53.841
(kissing and soft moaning)

07:53.874 --> 07:56.343
BOAZ: Kique,
this is Papa Cabrón.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.278
(speaking Spanish)

07:58.311 --> 08:00.614
You better not have
run off with that virgin Vargas.

08:00.648 --> 08:01.815
I already told you.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.885
(speaking Spanish)

08:04.918 --> 08:05.886
(phone beeps)
(smacking bottom)

08:05.919 --> 08:07.821
Let the me n talk.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.189
(women softly pout)

08:09.222 --> 08:10.791
Ass like that,

08:10.824 --> 08:12.726
you can't get in the States.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.194
(hip-hop music playing)

08:14.227 --> 08:16.296
I came back to Culiacán

08:16.329 --> 08:17.731
to look for Camila.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.667
Word is you might know
who has her.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.234
If I knew,
why would I tell you?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.136
Last time we met,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.005
we discussed a partnership.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.473
*

08:26.506 --> 08:27.675
(chuckles)

08:27.708 --> 08:30.811
So you want to cut La Jefa out?

08:30.844 --> 08:34.347
(drink pours)
Deal with me directly, huh?

08:34.381 --> 08:36.917
Finally coming to your senses.
(parrot squawking)

08:36.950 --> 08:38.085
I like that.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.220
You know, women at her age,

08:40.253 --> 08:42.355
they go through changes.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.224
Hormones and shit.
(parrot whistles)

08:44.257 --> 08:46.493
Makes them go crazy.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.161
And that's not just me.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.162
(parrot squawks)

08:49.196 --> 08:50.698
That's science.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.366
(laughs)

08:53.400 --> 08:55.035
Borracho.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.770
Is that safe for a parrot?

08:56.804 --> 08:59.406
(laughing)
It's okay.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.441
He's down to only one a day.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.043
I love this little pendejo.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.745
(parrot speaks indistinctly)

09:04.778 --> 09:06.847
BOAZ: A little bird told me

09:06.880 --> 09:08.916
Camila's safe back at the nest.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.784
*

09:10.818 --> 09:13.553
You mean at home with Epifanio?

09:13.587 --> 09:15.689
Yeah, I think
that's what we mean.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.057
Tell him what we mean, Borracho.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.291
(speaking Spanish)

09:18.325 --> 09:20.594
(laughs)
He crazy.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.030
BORRACHO: (speaking Spanish)
BOAZ: (laughing)

09:23.063 --> 09:24.898
He's crazy.
Hey!

09:24.932 --> 09:27.868
(speaking Spanish)

09:27.901 --> 09:30.537
Epifanio gave me
his whole empire.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.706
(soft dramatic music)

09:32.740 --> 09:34.241
It's mine.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.711
However, I have
a nagging feeling

09:37.745 --> 09:39.713
Camila's not gonna like
the arrangement,

09:39.747 --> 09:41.448
but...

09:43.917 --> 09:47.554
If you take out Camila,

09:47.587 --> 09:50.223
all of Dallas is yours.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.126
You gotta start
looking out for yourself.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.796

10:01.635 --> 10:02.903
What is this?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.171
I don't want to shoot her.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.106
What the hell you doing, Teresa?

10:06.139 --> 10:08.241
Either this is a joke
or I'm looking at a dead woman.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.577
Where the hell is my money?

10:10.610 --> 10:14.147
Bitch thinks you robbed her.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.583
You switched the product.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.851
I need it back.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.687
(Chase & Status' "Nervous")

10:19.720 --> 10:21.955
CHUCHO: We delivered the product
to Finch like we said.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.323
We didn't switch shit.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.292
And we expect to get paid.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.861
Now I'm only
going to say this once,

10:27.895 --> 10:30.463
give us our money and
take that piece off of Lil T

10:30.497 --> 10:32.700
and you might make it
out of here alive.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.968
She'll stay with me
until we get it back.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.204
* In the middle
of the moment *

10:37.237 --> 10:39.139
* The pressure's
gonna take you *

10:39.172 --> 10:40.974
Okay.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.676
Hit her, Kenny!

10:42.710 --> 10:45.012
* We are the only thing
that you need *

10:45.045 --> 10:46.814
* I can tell you're nervous

10:46.847 --> 10:47.881
* Hold it down
and just breathe *

10:47.915 --> 10:49.616
* Yeah

10:49.649 --> 10:51.318
* We are the only thing
that you need *

10:51.351 --> 10:53.286
* I can tell you're nervous

Who you calling?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.686
Devon still needs the coke.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.921
He might help us.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.189
This is gonna hurt.

DEVON: Hello.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.728
Devon.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.029
(over phone)
I'm in trouble.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.597
I need your help
to get the coke.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.532
The product has been
delivered in full.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.534
(over phone)
James arranged it.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.170
Trust me when I tell you,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.038
contacting me again will be

11:45.072 --> 11:47.707
an extremely poor decision
on your part.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.377
Good luck, Teresa.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.179
(phone beeps)

11:52.212 --> 11:53.680
(soft pained gasping)

11:53.713 --> 11:55.849
What is it?

11:55.883 --> 11:57.550
It was James that
changed the coke

11:57.584 --> 11:59.787
at the train yard.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.221
He played us.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.790
Now we have no way
to pay El Santo.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.592

They're somewhere around here!

TERESA: I can't run.

POTE: (speaking Spanish)
They're getting closer.

(dramatic sting)

12:48.101 --> 12:51.404
Where's your friend?

12:51.438 --> 12:52.906
I just found out it wasn't you

12:52.940 --> 12:55.242
who switched the coke;
I'm sorry.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.811
You are not forgiven.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.814
And I'm done playing games.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.851
Hey!

13:03.884 --> 13:07.420
My legs don't work,
but my finger works fine.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.123
And we're going
to get what's ours.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.425

13:33.313 --> 13:35.448
James tricked us.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.384
You're losing too much blood.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.052
I need to take you
to the doctor.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.287
No.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.055
Take me to El Santo's Angel.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.791
-Teresa.
-It's our only chance.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.360
We need to ask for more time.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.383
Mami, Papi,

14:10.417 --> 14:12.920
I'm in trouble.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.721
I've been kidnapped.

14:14.754 --> 14:18.158
I haven't been this scared
since I turned eight.

14:18.191 --> 14:22.930
And--it's new--
the phone, I'm sorry, it's new.

14:22.963 --> 14:27.267
Pedro Jimenez, he blames you
for his father's murder.

14:27.300 --> 14:31.004
I haven't been this scared
since I turned eight.

14:31.038 --> 14:35.175
And--it's new--
the phone, I'm sorry, it's new.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.178
(soft music)

14:38.211 --> 14:40.347
*

14:40.380 --> 14:43.016
How did you know
Camila was here?

14:43.050 --> 14:46.586
I need to speak to her.
We have business.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.022
You protected her
while she was away from me.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.458
Thank you.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.026
Where is she?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.427
Epifanio.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.629
What is it?

14:56.663 --> 14:58.198
I know where she is.

14:58.231 --> 15:03.303
*

15:03.336 --> 15:05.105
(phone beeps)

15:05.138 --> 15:08.241
I haven't been this scared
since I turned eight.

15:08.275 --> 15:13.380
And--it's new--
the phone, I'm sorry, it's new.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.747
For her eighth birthday,
we took her to

15:14.781 --> 15:16.249
the beach in Mazatlán,
remember?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.285
-Yeah.
-There's a Jimenez estate there.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.120
It's called Punto Nuevo.

15:20.153 --> 15:23.723
That's why she used those words.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.394
She used their message
to send us one of her own.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.296
She's truly
her mother's daughter.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.598
JAMES: You know the location.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.933
But do you know what kind
of force is holding her?

15:33.967 --> 15:37.937
Boaz cut off
half of Manuel's family.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.906
They have no cash for sicarios.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.243
Then it's just family.
What they asking for?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.744
10 million.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.279
10 million only goes so far

15:46.313 --> 15:48.281
if you've got
no one protecting you.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.749
I'd say they're
splitting the money,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.351
we're dealing with
less than ten men.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.785
It's revenge.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.588
He wants to kill them both.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.124
He's gonna keep Isabela hidden

15:57.157 --> 15:58.958
until he has the money.

15:58.992 --> 16:02.762
But to do that,
he has to split his men.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.198
You should give him
the 10 million.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.800
Let the money sparkle
in front of his eyes.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.536
And you, James,

16:09.569 --> 16:11.838
take Epifanio's soldiers,

16:11.871 --> 16:13.506
rescue our daughter,

16:13.540 --> 16:15.475
and show that Jimenez kid

16:15.508 --> 16:17.144
what real pain is.

(speaking Spanish)

18:05.084 --> 18:07.887
The greatest among you

18:07.920 --> 18:10.323
must become servants,

18:10.357 --> 18:12.259
as I am a servant.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.161
A servant to who?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.396
To live

18:16.429 --> 18:18.331
is to die.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.267
And to die

18:20.300 --> 18:22.335
is to begin again.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.971
And the serpent shall swallow

18:25.004 --> 18:26.573
its own tail.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.176
And within the circle,

18:29.209 --> 18:31.811

Moyocoyotzin.

He's insane,

Are you just gonna
sit there all day?

Life

by sundown.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.080
CORTEZ: Bravo, Pedro, bravo.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.583
You're a very brave young man.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.352
Thank you, Colonel.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.919
We're making things right.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.254
CORTEZ: Yes, we are.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.323
Your father would be proud.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.160
And--and my people
will be taken care of?

21:34.193 --> 21:36.596
You have my word.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.599
*

21:39.632 --> 21:41.634
The vermin

21:41.668 --> 21:45.438
who would kill a great man,

21:45.472 --> 21:49.609
like your father,

21:49.642 --> 21:53.112
they will answer
for their wicked deeds.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.247
(over phone)
I'll see you here soon.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.050
(phone beeps)

22:05.825 --> 22:09.061
(phone beeping)

22:23.410 --> 22:24.811
(phone beeps)
Hey.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.679
Guero.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.481
(over phone)
It's me.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.349
I know you went back to Culiacán

22:30.383 --> 22:31.851
because you wanted revenge

22:31.884 --> 22:34.554
for what Epifanio's men
did to me.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.489
That's not your revenge to take.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.825
We have to do it my way.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.060
(over phone)
But I need your help.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.663
What do you have in mind?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.432
Do you know where Epifanio is?

22:45.465 --> 22:50.269
*

22:50.302 --> 22:52.739
GUERO:
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.707
He's keeping
some interesting company.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.677
*

22:57.710 --> 22:59.045
TERESA: Will you help me?

22:59.078 --> 23:01.013
Always.

MAN: (speaking Spanish)

23:22.502 --> 23:24.370
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.205
Isabela, I'll die first.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.974
We're gonna get out of here.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.209
And we're gonna get away
from all this bullshit, Isabela.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.711
-Okay?
-Yeah.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.646
(kisses)

23:33.680 --> 23:36.649
(soft ominous music)

25:01.200 --> 25:02.802
(knife flicks)

25:02.835 --> 25:05.237
Thank you.
Thank you.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.839
Whoa-whoa--where's Pedro?

25:06.873 --> 25:08.074
We didn't find him.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.542
Huh, what do you mean?

25:09.576 --> 25:16.382
*

(kisses)

25:40.973 --> 25:43.743
It's okay, mi'ja.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.945
We were so worried
about you, Bela.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.714
(kisses)

25:47.747 --> 25:49.616
Why couldn't Kique come with us?

25:49.649 --> 25:52.084
His parents wanted him home.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.586
They love him.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.289
Just as we love you, okay?

25:57.323 --> 25:59.525
You know,

25:59.558 --> 26:02.862
he would have died for me.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.899
I'm gonna marry him.

26:06.933 --> 26:10.136
It'll be an alliance.

26:10.169 --> 26:14.473
Our families working together.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.809
You know it's been a long day.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.311
We'll talk about it later, okay?

26:19.345 --> 26:20.647
(kisses)

26:22.815 --> 26:25.785
(tender music builds)

26:35.094 --> 26:38.297
(jet engine roars)

26:39.531 --> 26:41.634
Thank you

26:41.668 --> 26:43.636
for saving my daughter.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.741
I've stayed by your side.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.177
I stayed loyal.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.012
But you're back
with your family now.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.947
You don't need me anymore.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.115
(sighs)

26:56.148 --> 26:58.751
Where would you go?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.619
I got the 27 million from Devon.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.288
(phone rings, beeps)

27:02.321 --> 27:04.824
I'll deliver it back to you,
but I want a cut.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.092
(chuckles)

27:06.125 --> 27:07.994
I'd say 1/3 is fair.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.496
9 million's a good beginning.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.767
I have one more
question for you.

27:14.801 --> 27:18.771
How did you know
I was with Epifanio?

27:18.805 --> 27:20.439
Boaz told me.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.374
Did he offer you a deal?

27:22.408 --> 27:24.176
He wanted me to kill you.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.979
(soft dramatic music)

27:27.013 --> 27:28.815
Good-bye, my loyal friend.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.382
If you ever need anything,

27:30.416 --> 27:32.118
you know where to find me.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.953
*

27:33.986 --> 27:36.055
(glasses clink)

27:36.088 --> 27:38.791
We have more than just our
daughter's safety to celebrate.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.127
I have some very good news.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.830
My sources in Dallas
just told me that

27:43.863 --> 27:47.566
the DEA agent that arrested you
has been suspended.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.202
And all charges against you
will be dropped.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.504
What about the agents
that were killed?

27:52.538 --> 27:54.340
One thing at a time, mi amor.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.908
We'll deal with that.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.744
But this means that
your name will be cleared,

27:57.777 --> 28:00.412
and you no longer
have to be afraid.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.548
Camila.

28:02.581 --> 28:05.885
I am done with this business.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.887
Stay with us in Culiacán,
mi amor.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.923
Be a mother to Isabela.
Be my wife.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.225
Let's be a family
before the world

28:13.259 --> 28:15.895
tries to tear us apart again.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.731
*

28:18.765 --> 28:21.700
What do you say?

28:21.734 --> 28:24.236
Okay.

28:24.270 --> 28:31.277
*

28:36.983 --> 28:38.684
Why did we land here?

28:38.717 --> 28:39.786
This isn't Culiacán.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.954
(dramatic music)

28:41.988 --> 28:42.789
JAMES: Hey,
what the hell is this?

28:42.822 --> 28:44.757
Hey-hey.

28:44.791 --> 28:45.691
Stay right there.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.293
Hey, Epi.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.895
Give me a reason
to cut you down right here.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.296
Come on, you two guys
off the plane.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.563
-Mami, Papi.
GUERO: Andale.

28:51.597 --> 28:52.731
You two guys got a date.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.734
(dramatic music pounds)

28:55.768 --> 29:02.775
*

29:13.285 --> 29:15.454
We're not here to hurt anyone.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.324
You tried to set me up,
but we can still make a deal.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.060
With a drug mule?
(chuckles)

29:21.093 --> 29:24.496
Take your rat boyfriend and
leave before my army arrives

29:24.530 --> 29:27.166
and makes what Gato did to you
feel like a warm bath.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.601
Not the best way
to start a negotiation.

29:29.635 --> 29:31.103
I'll deal with you soon enough.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.571
TERESA: It's okay, Pote.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.107
This is between me and them.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.775
CAMILA: You have nothing.

29:36.809 --> 29:40.412
You come here with my cook
and your lover.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.815
You lost your distributor.

29:42.849 --> 29:45.952
And without him,
El Santo will consume you.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.854
You have Devon.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.822
But I'm the connection
with the product.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.657
If I go away,
Bolivia goes away.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.592
You know that.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.461
People will always
buy shit coke.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.929
Devon won't.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.597
You need El Santo.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.833
EPIFANIO: You and that madman
can rot in Hell.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.768
You want a deal?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.971
Go talk to Boaz Jimenez.

30:05.004 --> 30:08.374
Camila and I are
done with this business.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.377
(soft suspenseful music)

30:11.410 --> 30:13.179
Is that true?

30:13.212 --> 30:17.984
*

30:18.017 --> 30:20.219
TERESA: If you're out,
I'll leave in peace.

30:20.252 --> 30:23.155
If you're not out,
I want Dallas.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.490
I'll continue to provide you

30:24.523 --> 30:26.292
with the product
El Santo gave you.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.460
Then we can finally be partners.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.796
Dallas is mine.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.999
The only deal that goes on here

30:33.032 --> 30:34.500
ends with you in the grave.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.701
EPIFANIO:
What are you saying, Camila?

30:35.734 --> 30:37.904
You promised me you'd come home.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.538
*

30:39.571 --> 30:41.874
(speaking Spanish)

30:41.908 --> 30:43.375
EPIFANIO: Enough of this shit.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.677
If I have to
save you from yourself

30:45.711 --> 30:47.146
to save our family,

30:47.179 --> 30:48.580
so be it.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.516
(pistol fires)
EPIFANIO: (grunts)

30:50.549 --> 30:51.583
Papi?

30:51.617 --> 30:52.919
He's been shot.

30:52.952 --> 30:53.920
-Papi.
GUERO: Hey-hey-hey!

30:53.953 --> 30:54.753
(speaking Spanish)

30:54.786 --> 30:56.722
(yelps)

30:56.755 --> 30:58.424
(grunts)

30:58.457 --> 31:00.859
Stay on the plane.
I'll get help.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.394
God damn it.

31:02.428 --> 31:03.662
(suspenseful music)

31:03.695 --> 31:05.197
CAMILA: It's okay.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.499
*

31:07.533 --> 31:08.901
Here we are again.

31:08.935 --> 31:11.337
I tried to steal
someone you love,

31:11.370 --> 31:14.273
and somehow you managed
to do the same.

31:14.306 --> 31:17.043
Love and this business
cannot coexist.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.010
Epifanio...

31:18.044 --> 31:19.045
That's why I have to

31:19.078 --> 31:20.346
choose for you, my love.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.381
No.

31:22.414 --> 31:23.782
Stop this.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.384
There's another way.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.253
There is no other way.

31:27.286 --> 31:34.293
*

31:35.827 --> 31:37.096
(pistol cocks, fires)

31:42.301 --> 31:44.236
I told you
I'd kill you someday.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.404
You want to shoot me?

31:45.437 --> 31:47.439
Go ahead.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.908
I'm walking away.

31:49.942 --> 31:53.879
Camila and I are done.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.315
Not with Teresa's cut
of the money you're not.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.719
If I give her that money,

32:00.752 --> 32:03.222
she's gonna have
a foothold in this business.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.324
And you and I both know
how that ends.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.229
You're everything I ever wanted.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.398
Don't let our daughter
become you.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.832
(tender dramatic music)

32:13.865 --> 32:15.834
I'll leave the business,
I promise.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.236
No, you won't, my love.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.237
I will.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.405
Don't!

32:19.438 --> 32:21.507
(pistol fires)
(groans)

32:23.175 --> 32:25.477
(soft dramatic music)

32:25.511 --> 32:26.812
No-no-no.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.082
No, no.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.617
Go back to the plane!

32:31.650 --> 32:35.287
*

32:35.321 --> 32:37.023

32:50.169 --> 32:53.039
No, please.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.180
You're not gonna kill me
in front of my daughter.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.984
If you really love her,

33:06.018 --> 33:07.553
say you never found me.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.288
You tried to kill her.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.357
I was 15 feet away from her.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.560
I never missed a target
from that distance in my life.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.896
And I would never hurt her
like you did.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.666
(sirens wailing distantly)

33:20.699 --> 33:26.705
*

33:26.738 --> 33:29.007
POTE: Teresa,
if you don't kill her now,

33:29.041 --> 33:31.477
she'll come after you
with everything she got.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.512
(approaching sirens wailing)

33:33.545 --> 33:36.048
There's $10 million
on the plane.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.683
Take it.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.651
And get out of here
while you can.

33:39.685 --> 33:40.852
Where's Guero?

33:40.886 --> 33:41.920
He'll meet us at the meet point.

33:41.953 --> 33:42.754
Get the money and go.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.056
Let's go.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.992
(sirens wailing)

33:47.025 --> 33:49.995
(dramatic music builds)

33:50.028 --> 33:56.602
*

34:13.885 --> 34:16.655
(engine revving)

34:19.625 --> 34:21.427
TERESA: Did you find
El Santo's people?

34:21.460 --> 34:22.628
Did you pay them?

34:22.661 --> 34:23.795
KING GEORGE: I paid 'em.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.531
You're all good with El Santo,

34:25.564 --> 34:27.065
till the next time you're not.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.234
(sirens wailing distantly)

34:28.267 --> 34:29.201
Federales are closing in.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.369
We can't stay here.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.870
Get yourself to the ship,

34:31.903 --> 34:33.539
and we'll meet you there
at dusk.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.606
Let's go.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.908
(cell phone rings)

34:36.942 --> 34:39.145
(engines revving)

34:39.178 --> 34:40.779
Where are you?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.281
Hey, look, I'm on my way
to the meeting spot,

34:42.314 --> 34:43.715
but I got a little bit
of heat on me.

34:43.749 --> 34:44.583
TERESA: Okay.

34:44.616 --> 34:45.784
Lose them first.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.786
Meet us at the port.

34:47.819 --> 34:48.954
I love you.

34:48.987 --> 34:50.589
I love you too.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.324
(phone beeps)
Let's go.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.426
(speaking Spanish)

34:54.460 --> 34:56.061
He outran me.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.963
He can outrun those pendejos.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.598
(sirens wailing)

34:59.631 --> 35:03.535
WOMAN (on TV):
(speaking Spanish)

35:08.974 --> 35:12.478
(soft brooding music)

35:12.511 --> 35:16.948
WOMAN (on TV):
(continues speaking Spanish)

35:16.982 --> 35:18.817
Mom?

35:18.850 --> 35:21.487
Isabela, go to your room.

35:21.520 --> 35:26.292
*

35:26.325 --> 35:29.595
You tried to kill me
behind my husband's back.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.763
And now,

35:31.797 --> 35:33.265
you have the nerve

35:33.299 --> 35:35.434
to come to his home

35:35.467 --> 35:38.837
and stand in front of
his grieving widow.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.372
Know this,

35:40.406 --> 35:44.042
you'll never
leave this house alive, Colonel.

35:44.075 --> 35:51.082
*

35:52.684 --> 35:55.053
Forgive me,

35:55.086 --> 35:58.156
mi jefa.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.292
I admit

36:00.326 --> 36:04.263
I did send sicarios
after you in Dallas.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.501
CORTEZ:
But you were his weakness.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.505
You have always been
the smarter,

36:13.539 --> 36:17.876
more powerful partner.

36:17.909 --> 36:23.815
And I ask that in your grief,

36:23.849 --> 36:26.885
you allow me to serve you.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.723
How would you serve me?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.663
Together, we will

36:37.696 --> 36:40.165
take back your business
from Boaz Jimenez.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.200
And we will rebuild
the Vargas Cartel

36:42.234 --> 36:43.702
to its apotheosis.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.937
And when we do that,

36:45.971 --> 36:48.006
together,

36:48.039 --> 36:49.875
we will get our revenge
on the person

36:49.908 --> 36:51.543
who took Epifanio from us.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.688
Why should I ever
give you my trust?

37:02.721 --> 37:05.691
You will give me nothing.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.059
I will earn your trust.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.629
Or I don't deserve it.

37:13.164 --> 37:17.903
May I begin with a gift?

37:17.936 --> 37:21.373
(speaking Spanish)

37:21.407 --> 37:24.376
(soft dramatic music)

37:24.410 --> 37:25.477
*

37:25.511 --> 37:27.579
(soft muffled groaning)

37:27.613 --> 37:34.320
*

37:34.353 --> 37:37.556
CORTEZ: My people caught
this pathetic kidnapper

37:37.589 --> 37:40.292
trying to flee the country.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.728
What's wrong with him?

37:42.761 --> 37:45.997
He said some disparaging things
about your daughter.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.466
PEDRO: (soft groaning)

37:47.499 --> 37:49.335
CORTEZ: So,

37:49.368 --> 37:51.903
I cut his wicked tongue out.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.941
*

37:55.974 --> 37:58.410
Dispose of this creature.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.579
And then,

38:00.612 --> 38:02.648
meet me in my office.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.816
PEDRO: (soft groaning)

38:04.850 --> 38:08.019
(music builds)

38:08.053 --> 38:08.987
(speaking Spanish)

38:09.020 --> 38:13.124
*

38:20.031 --> 38:22.968
(distant chatter)

38:24.970 --> 38:27.305
King George says that
we're ready to sail.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.278
Guero's not here yet.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.647
(soft dramatic music)

38:35.681 --> 38:38.283
I know he isn't.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.552
*

38:40.586 --> 38:43.321
(gentle ominous music)

38:43.355 --> 38:50.362
*

38:53.399 --> 38:56.768
The heart will kill you
faster than a bullet.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.074
Let's go.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.712
Sí, señora.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.582
Let's go.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.559
(indistinct talking)

39:20.592 --> 39:22.394
(dramatic music)

39:22.428 --> 39:26.432
CAMILA: (speaking Spanish)

39:26.465 --> 39:29.835
*

39:29.868 --> 39:33.338
Epifanio was
a man of the people.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.575
(speaking Spanish)

39:36.608 --> 39:38.176
But above all,

39:38.209 --> 39:41.212
he was a man
that loved his family.

39:41.246 --> 39:45.651
(speaking Spanish)

40:02.000 --> 40:06.137
*

40:06.171 --> 40:09.575
(speaking Spanish)

40:09.608 --> 40:12.744
CAMILA:
Wherever she tries to hide,

40:12.778 --> 40:16.247
I will hunt her down.

40:16.281 --> 40:18.784
I will capture

40:18.817 --> 40:22.921
the wicked criminal
who destroyed my family.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.824
And I will make her pay.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.827
(dramatic music builds)

40:28.860 --> 40:35.867
*

41:05.664 --> 41:07.533
