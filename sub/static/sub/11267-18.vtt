WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.211
Previously on 90210...
Oh, my God.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.631
I think someone's
out in the water.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.299
VANESSA: Nice job.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.926
Hope the water
wasn't too cold.

00:08.968 --> 00:10.511
DIXON:
Guess who just called me.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.512
Lee Brodsky's
assistant.

00:11.553 --> 00:12.763
As in, the movie producer?

00:12.805 --> 00:14.890
He wants to meet tomorrow
about some songs

00:14.932 --> 00:17.100
for the new action film.
Pretty sure I got
stood up.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.811
I thought I was
the only one.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.771
You don't happen to be
a musical duo, do you?

00:20.813 --> 00:22.982
I'm in this movie
that starts rehearsals today.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.316
I didn't even audition
for this one.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.067
Vanessa was at the Carrington
and happened to

00:26.109 --> 00:27.611
bump into the producer.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.989
You should also consider getting
tested for the Braca gene.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.700
Your aunt and your grandmother
all died of breast cancer.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.160
Okay, that is awesome.
Yeah, and it's gonna
look even awesomer

00:35.202 --> 00:36.912
when you actually put it up.

00:36.954 --> 00:37.997
Wow.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.581
I think you secretly
really care about stuff.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.959
And I bet you know just the
thing to give my life meaning.

00:42.001 --> 00:44.920
We are going to make
and market designer tote bags.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.088
You don't need a man,
and neither do I.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.465
PRESTON: I'm Preston.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.592
I'm... Naomi Clark.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.636
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Preston.

00:52.678 --> 00:56.223
Pleasure's all mine.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.684
JEN:
Ladies, are you excited to see

00:58.726 --> 01:00.811
what the future
has in store for us?

01:00.853 --> 01:02.479
The answers are in the cards.

01:02.521 --> 01:06.066
Ask the right questions and
the future's yours to know.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.442
I met a man.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.694
Tell me everything

01:08.736 --> 01:09.611
you see about him.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.071
You met someone?

01:11.112 --> 01:12.031
I did.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.532
I was playing
tennis at the club,

01:13.574 --> 01:16.744
and I hit a ball onto the golf
course, he threw it back to me,

01:16.785 --> 01:20.039
and our eyes met, and,
well, the rest was magic.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.665
His name...
WOMAN: No!

01:21.707 --> 01:24.292
If you utter a man's name
before he's yours,

01:24.334 --> 01:26.003
you'll jinx the relationship.

01:26.045 --> 01:26.962
Okay.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.631
Tell me everything
you see about--

01:29.673 --> 01:33.092
well, let's just call
him my, uh, mystery man.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.512
Well, your cards show
great passion.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.806
I see you rolling around.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.975
It's heated and dirty and...

01:40.017 --> 01:41.226
Okay!

01:41.268 --> 01:43.437
Well, I'll just stop
while I'm ahead.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.688
Sounds perfect.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.774
Anyways, ladies,

01:46.815 --> 01:50.360
if you'll excuse me, I need
to head to the spa for a wax.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.737
Have fun with Sybil.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.406
Would you like to
know your future?

01:54.448 --> 01:58.077
I wish everyone would
stop asking me that.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.662
It's not always a good thing
to know your future.

02:00.704 --> 02:01.830
Well, I would like to know mine,

02:01.872 --> 02:03.248
so tell me everything
you know about PJ.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.709
It's not clear, but...

02:05.751 --> 02:11.048
I see a broken heart
from the one you love most.

02:11.090 --> 02:12.883
You know, I think this is
all a load of crap.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.218
I mean, I'm not gonna let
a bunch of magic cards

02:15.260 --> 02:17.137
determine my future with PJ.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.014
When he comes over to work
with you later this afternoon,

02:19.056 --> 02:21.266
I'm gonna happen to come by
in something amazing,

02:21.308 --> 02:23.060
and maybe an accidental
nip slip will happen.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.061
Oh, no, no.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.646
Naomi, we have a lot
of work to do.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.647
Please don't distract him

02:26.688 --> 02:27.982
right now.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.191
Okay, look, I've never believed
in love at first sight

02:30.233 --> 02:31.568
before I met PJ.

02:31.610 --> 02:36.657
I mean, when I saw him, my heart
started to beat really fast

02:36.698 --> 02:39.618
and I lost my breath,
and I don't know,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.536
I think he might
really be the one.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.838
(sighs)

02:50.879 --> 02:52.631
Happy first day
of shooting.
Thanks.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.383
Okay, last time I
checked, movie stars--

02:55.425 --> 02:57.094
they didn't do
manual labor.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.470
It helps calm me down.

02:58.512 --> 03:03.350
Look, you are gonna walk on that
set for the first day today

03:03.391 --> 03:05.602
and show all those people
what I already know:

03:05.644 --> 03:07.354
that you're amazing.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.689
And smart.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.648
Hmm.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.983
(chuckles softly)

03:11.025 --> 03:12.109
VANESSA:
And talented.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.568
LIAM:
Okay.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.906
Now...
(slaps behind)
Oh.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.658
Go get to the set
before you're late.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.200
I'll take care of the bar.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.911
All right.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.039
Hey.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.165
Yeah?

03:27.166 --> 03:28.750
Thank you.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.461
(whispers):
Yeah.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.754
Go get 'em!

03:38.259 --> 03:40.428
What are you doing?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.847
Why do you have my phone?

03:41.889 --> 03:43.640
I knew it was you.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.518
You called me at the exact same
time as the Def Jam producer

03:46.560 --> 03:48.478
called to set up that
meeting in Echo Park.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.271
You sabotaged our meeting
with the movie producer

03:50.313 --> 03:51.815
so you could get
Liam the part.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.734
I can't believe
you think I would do that.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.943
I called you to see

03:54.985 --> 03:57.487
if you'd consider
coming back to work at the bar.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.322
(chuckles):
Okay.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.534
You know what, I would,
I would rather have a job

04:02.576 --> 04:06.246
kissing Kim Kardashian's ass
than to work with you again.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.916
Okay, well, I care about Liam,

04:08.957 --> 04:12.460
and you're Liam's friend,
so I care about you, too.

04:12.502 --> 04:16.380
Which is why I'm not gonna tell
him about this little incident.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.926
You stealing my bag,
snooping through my phone,

04:18.966 --> 04:20.719
calling me names--

04:20.761 --> 04:22.721
doesn't exactly paint
you in the best light.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.600
But if you keep accusing
me of things I didn't do,

04:26.641 --> 04:29.352
I may not be so
understanding next time.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.776
IVY: I cannot believe
we got away with

04:35.817 --> 04:37.236
painting that entire
billboard last night

04:37.277 --> 04:38.403
without
getting caught.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.114
That was nothing
compared to a few nights ago

04:40.155 --> 04:41.949
when you blasted
that freeway overpass.
(laughs)

04:41.990 --> 04:43.242
You got cojones,
Ivy Sullivan.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.325
Yeah, well...

04:44.367 --> 04:46.161
(phone ringing)

04:46.203 --> 04:47.454
It's Sonia.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.455
Yeah, who's that?

04:48.496 --> 04:49.623
Uh, that would
be the chick

04:49.664 --> 04:50.832
who runs the gallery
that you vandalized.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.126
Maybe she's calling
to thank me for putting

04:52.167 --> 04:53.168
something worth seeing
up on her walls.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.795
Hey, Sonia.
What's up?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.046
Well, I'm glad I caught you.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.756
I thought you'd be sleeping.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.840
Huh?

04:58.882 --> 05:00.884
Well, you've clearly
been busy at night.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.011
Every morning,
I see more and more of

05:03.053 --> 05:04.721
your art popping up
all over the place.

05:04.763 --> 05:05.931
What do you mean, my art?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.849
The silhouettes
of the kids dancing.

05:07.891 --> 05:08.976
I know that's you.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.144
I recognize one of the pictures

05:10.185 --> 05:11.519
from the exhibit
we did together.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.231
You cross that with the graffiti
that shut down my gallery

05:14.273 --> 05:15.523
for the last two weeks,

05:15.565 --> 05:17.734
and I think we both know
what's going on.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.278
You know, I-I don't know
what to say.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.446
I mean, I don't really know
what you're talking about.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.573
Just come by my gallery later;
we need to talk.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.035
Something wrong?

05:27.077 --> 05:29.246
DIXON: Yeah.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.081
Yeah, okay.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.124
No, that's great.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.583
No, no, no.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.626
Yeah.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.544
Definitely.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.629
Okay, no, we'll come in.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.298
Okay. Okay, good-bye.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.424
Who was that?

05:41.466 --> 05:44.011
That was JD's
label executive.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.304
JD's back in rehab.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.472
Okay. Yay?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.267
No, um... his band had
to pull out of doing

05:50.309 --> 05:52.060
the Desert Valley Music
Festival tomorrow.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.313
And, uh, he pitched
us to the team,

05:54.353 --> 05:56.023
and we booked it.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.065
(laughs)

05:57.107 --> 05:58.275
We're playing
the festival tomorrow.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.068
Are you serious?!
Kind of makes working on

06:00.110 --> 06:02.070
some stupid movie soundtrack
seem kind of lame, huh?

06:02.112 --> 06:03.905
Yes, totally.

06:03.947 --> 06:04.865
(sighs)

06:04.906 --> 06:06.658
About that.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.951
I am almost positive

06:07.993 --> 06:10.120
that Vanessa set us up
to miss our meeting.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.830
And she denies everything.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.332
Don't you think
someone should tell Liam?

06:13.372 --> 06:14.499
No, no, no,
look, look, look.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.543
I understand you have
that whole girl, uh,

06:16.584 --> 06:19.171
"I have a gut instinct"
feeling, okay?

06:19.213 --> 06:22.049
But if you don't have any
proof, go the guy route:

06:22.090 --> 06:23.424
just let it go, bro.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.676
All right?

06:24.718 --> 06:25.635
We need to focus.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.012
This could be
our big break.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.305
No, you're right.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.349
From now on,
it'll be just about our music.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.267
Yes. Come here.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.437
Now, I got a playlist
and everything set up.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.941
I think they're giving us
about 25 minutes, so...

06:45.404 --> 06:47.949
So I'm thinking
we should go with this bag.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.659
If that's what
you want, done.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.620
It's not about what I want,
it's about what we want.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.207
Well, do we want
to take a break?

06:55.249 --> 06:57.209
Because I'm starving,
and I think

06:57.251 --> 06:59.002
it's affecting my golf swing.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.921
Oh, my God, I thought
it was just us girls.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.297
I should really put on
something to cover up.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.132
(Preston chuckles)

07:04.174 --> 07:05.759
Subtlety's an
overrated art.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.136
Naomi, we still
have to go over

07:08.178 --> 07:10.138
our sales plan
before lunch and...

07:10.180 --> 07:11.556
Good point.
I'm starving.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.682
I like her.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.976
NAOMI:
Annie, could you be a dear,

07:15.018 --> 07:18.063
go out and fetch us
something to nibble on?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.106
Now.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.525
(chuckles)
Tell me more about

07:22.567 --> 07:24.652
what it is
that you like about me.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.321
Naomi, have you seen
my four-inch black heels?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.407
The ones with...
Go away, Jen.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.950
Anyway, what
were you saying?

07:29.991 --> 07:32.744
Preston, what are you
doing here?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.704
Well, look who it is.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.415
How's that backhand
of yours, huh?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.376
You still hitting tennis
balls onto the putting green?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.669
Well, maybe you could, um,
help me practice sometime.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.131
Oh, my God.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.591
Jen, can I borrow you
in the kitchen for a second?

07:48.927 --> 07:52.597
You did not tell me
your mystery man was PJ.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.015
How do you know him?

07:54.057 --> 07:55.434
I know him because he's mine.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.311
"Mine"...

07:57.352 --> 07:58.270
I would never, okay?

07:58.312 --> 07:59.854
I didn't know you
were dating him.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.565
Well, we aren't dating per say,
but I met him last week

08:02.607 --> 08:04.067
and we had this
amazing connection and...

08:04.109 --> 08:05.610
I met him yesterday
at the club,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.570
and we had more than
just a connection, okay?

08:07.612 --> 08:08.571
It was kismet.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.614
But it doesn't matter.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.865
I saw him first
and I call dibs.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.075
What is this,
middle school?

08:12.117 --> 08:13.410
He is not
yours to claim.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.411
Look, since we
both just met him,

08:14.453 --> 08:16.037
why don't we
let him decide.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.290
Whoever he asks out
first gets him.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.000
You want to compete
with me over a man?

08:20.041 --> 08:22.877
Oh, I don't really
see it as competition.

08:22.919 --> 08:23.753
It's on.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.130
Good.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.258
Ow!

08:35.807 --> 08:37.476
(gasps)

08:37.517 --> 08:38.434
(gasps)

08:38.477 --> 08:39.644
I'm so sorry.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.104
Looks like you're gonna
have to go change.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.397
Don't worry.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.441
I will keep PJ company
while you're gone.

08:44.483 --> 08:48.403
Maybe even long enough for...
him to ask me out.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.155
Ciao.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.705
(theme music playing)

09:11.718 --> 09:16.764
♪ ♪

09:18.599 --> 09:20.519
There's the sexiest P.A.
in Hollywood.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.145
(chuckles)
You ready for lunch?

09:22.187 --> 09:23.771
More like ready
for a vacation.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.149
I haven't sat down
in seven hours.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.567
Hey, new girl,
they called grace.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.027
That means we're not
breaking out.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.362
We need you back on set.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.446
Can you watch my stuff?

09:31.488 --> 09:32.739
I'll be back in a minute.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.366
Yeah.
Thanks.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.621
Oh, my God.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.208
This is the girl that Liam
rescued from your charity gala.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.292
Okay.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.002
Don't you get it?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.295
This is a head shot.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.463
She's an actress.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.466
What if the whole rescue
was a setup?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.468
It could prove
that Vanessa hired her.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.724
It's like a morgue in here.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.934
Everything on the walls

10:00.975 --> 10:02.310
is dead and hollow.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.645
Could you take this seriously
for, like, a second, Diego?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.647
We could go to jail
if she presses charges.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.690
Hey, settle down.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.692
I'm not gonna let
that happen, okay?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.278
SONIA:
Ivy. You're here.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.320
Sonia, hi.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.739
Um, and this is?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.324
I'm the guy
who painted up your gallery.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.368
So if you're looking
for anybody to punish,

10:18.410 --> 10:20.620
then that would be me.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.330
Although, personally,
I think you should thank me

10:22.372 --> 10:24.458
for putting something good
up on your walls for once.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.210
So, I'm talking
to both of you.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.880
Your graffiti is...

10:30.922 --> 10:32.466
beautiful.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.179
So you're not, you're
not pressing charges?

10:38.221 --> 10:39.556
SONIA:
Let me finish.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.016
Now, since you two owe me
for your little stunt,

10:42.058 --> 10:43.684
I have a proposition.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.396
You do a show at my gallery, and
I won't report you to the cops.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.688
We all come
out on top.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.274
Wait, really?
Wait a second.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.276
You can't blackmail us
into selling art.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.402
I'd rather go to jail.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.112
(chuckles) He doesn't
actually mean that.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.447
Looks like you and
your boyfriend need

10:55.489 --> 10:57.991
some time to
discuss...
I'm not her boyfriend.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.034
Just think
about it, okay?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.744
I think we could
have a very

11:01.786 --> 11:04.498
profitable future together.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.003
I don't know
what planet you're from,

11:10.044 --> 11:12.046
but here on Earth,
we have a little expression

11:12.088 --> 11:13.465
for those who trespass,

11:13.507 --> 11:16.968
and it goes something like,
"Get the hell off my planet

11:17.010 --> 11:18.512
or I'll blow your brains out."

11:18.553 --> 11:20.555
(bell rings)
And cut.
One more time please.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.266
(phone ringing)

11:27.854 --> 11:29.063
Hello?

11:29.105 --> 11:30.731
NURSE:
Erin, this is Dr. Hall's office.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.192
I've left you so many messages,

11:32.233 --> 11:34.194
I was worried
I have the wrong number.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.780
Have you made a decision about
scheduling your BRCA gene test?

11:37.822 --> 11:38.990
Hey, new girl.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.159
(phone beeps)
No personal calls on set.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.119
You make yourself useful
and take this to props.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.287
DIRECTOR:
Action!

11:44.329 --> 11:46.206
(clapper snaps)

11:46.247 --> 11:47.706
I don't know
what planet you're from,

11:47.748 --> 11:50.126
but here on Earth,
we have a little expression

11:50.168 --> 11:51.169
for trespassers.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.839
Cut!

11:54.881 --> 11:56.508
(bell rings)

11:59.469 --> 12:02.556
Um, ju-just a second?

12:09.770 --> 12:10.938
Hey, you okay?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.731
It's no big deal.

12:12.773 --> 12:16.819
I was gonna have to shoot
the scene like 20 times anyway.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.738
What's-what's wrong?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.866
Silver, talk to me.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.248
I might have the cancer gene,

12:28.289 --> 12:31.334
and I don't know if I want
to take the test to find out.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.961
I might have to have surgery,

12:34.003 --> 12:36.005
and I might...

12:36.047 --> 12:38.925
have to freeze my eggs
if I want to have kids.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.386
And I haven't even told
any of the girls any of this

12:41.428 --> 12:45.348
because I don't want them
to worry about me.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.643
And... and I don't want to die.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.480
You're looking at me all weird.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.023
Sorry.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.943
No, uh...

12:56.984 --> 13:00.488
I mean, that-that
sounds bad, right?

13:00.530 --> 13:03.491
Yeah, yeah, yeah, um...
never mind.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.370
Look, I'm sorry that I-I-I
dropped all of this on you.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.204
Just please don't

13:08.246 --> 13:10.039
tell anybody, okay?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.553
Hi.
If you're here
to start a fight,

13:23.595 --> 13:24.721
I do not have time.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.180
PJ will be here
in five minutes,

13:26.222 --> 13:27.641
and I have to get fabulous.
You already

13:27.682 --> 13:29.476
are fabulous.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.479
Here, it's a peace offering.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.897
What is it?

13:38.359 --> 13:40.153
Moisturizer?

13:40.194 --> 13:41.988
Well, it's from France.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.073
Something about the bodily
fluids of roe deer.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.284
It works wonders
on your pores.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.119
(chuckles)

13:48.161 --> 13:50.829
Did you lace it with something
that's gonna burn my face off?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.624
Thank you very much,

13:52.666 --> 13:54.833
but I think I'll use
my own moisturizer.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.212
Suit yourself.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.255
I mean, honestly,

13:59.297 --> 14:01.508
the whole Clark sisters
and peace offerings

14:01.549 --> 14:03.842
really doesn't make
any logical sense.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.136
Oh, my God!

14:06.262 --> 14:07.764
What are you doing, Jen?

14:07.806 --> 14:08.847
Stop it!

14:08.889 --> 14:10.016
Really, Jen?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.267
Are you serious?

14:11.309 --> 14:12.226
You can't win, so you have

14:12.268 --> 14:14.145
to lock me
out of the competition?

14:14.187 --> 14:17.148
Oh, look, someone left
their phone out here.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.651
Oh, well, it's a shame

14:19.693 --> 14:21.402
you bought such
a garishly large house.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.737
No one's gonna hear your screams

14:22.779 --> 14:24.905
from all the way up here.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.034
Listen, I will be sure to tell
Preston that you say hello.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.160
Okay?

14:29.202 --> 14:30.411
Ciao, ciao.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.038
You're a bitch!

14:32.079 --> 14:33.456
(banging on door)

14:34.749 --> 14:35.916
I think you'd be
making a big mistake

14:35.958 --> 14:37.084
working with that sellout.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.919
You know,
you sure have a lot of opinions

14:38.961 --> 14:40.296
about how I should live my life

14:40.338 --> 14:41.506
for somebody
who's just a friend.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.591
What's that
supposed to mean?

14:43.633 --> 14:45.468
Nothing.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.762
No, wait a second.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.514
That's what this is about?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.265
The girlfriend thing?

14:51.307 --> 14:53.601
Why didn't you say so?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.895
Dude, because...

14:55.936 --> 14:57.397
Because, okay?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.733
I don't want to be that girl
who needs validation.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.067
I don't,

15:01.108 --> 15:02.902
but right now in my life,

15:02.943 --> 15:06.865
I guess I kind of am that girl
who needs validation.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.783
I mean, I know we're not,
like, officially together.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.076
I know that.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.078
I just kind of figured
that was the direction

15:12.119 --> 15:13.329
that we'd be going in.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.082
Well, I mean, why do we have
to define our relationship

15:16.123 --> 15:17.208
in conventional terms?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.418
It's like street art.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.795
Let's just enjoy what we
have now, in the moment,

15:20.837 --> 15:22.463
and screw what
anybody else thinks.
Diego,

15:22.505 --> 15:24.799
Diego, it's not
about street art.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.886
Okay, it's not
about how other people feel.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.679
It's about this.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.849
This thing, this relationship
or whatever you want to call it.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.475
It's about how you
and I feel about each other,

15:34.517 --> 15:37.228
and I just, I don't get you;
one minute you're taking

15:37.270 --> 15:38.396
the rap for me with Sonya,

15:38.438 --> 15:39.980
the next you don't
even know how to say

15:40.022 --> 15:40.940
how you feel about me.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.443
Look, I show you how I feel.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.821
Just so you know, you're not
doing a really good job.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.991
Come to think of it,

15:51.033 --> 15:52.869
maybe I will work
with that sellout.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.705
At least she sees
some sort of future with me.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.593
(phone ringing)

16:08.635 --> 16:10.261
Hey, babe, where you at?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.138
I'm stuck at home.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.515
I think I had some bad sushi
for lunch.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.768
Will you be able to do
the meeting without me?

16:16.810 --> 16:19.103
I guess I have no choice now.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.230
(door opens)
Hey, wait, here's Marilyn.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.482
I'll talk to you later.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.573
Dixon, I presume?

16:30.615 --> 16:32.116
Yes. Hi, Marilyn.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.409
Thanks for coming in so late.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.369
Where's your partner?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.204
Oh, sh-sh-she's...
she's not here.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.373
But we can go over
the playlist together.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.333
When I heard

16:40.374 --> 16:41.709
you were working with Adrianna,

16:41.751 --> 16:43.294
I got to say,
I had my reservations.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.964
And now that she's flaked
on our first meeting,

16:46.005 --> 16:47.381
I think she's proven me right.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.883
Uh, what are you talking about?

16:48.925 --> 16:52.052
Adrianna has a certain
reputation in this business,

16:52.094 --> 16:53.721
and it's not a good one.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.474
I know, um,
and she's completely changed.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.558
Um,

16:57.600 --> 16:58.559
I trust her,

16:58.601 --> 17:00.019
and she's just home sick
right now.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.146
(scoffs) Come with me.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.987
Hey.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.989
What are you doing here?
Everything okay?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.490
Actually, no.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.200
What's going on?

17:14.241 --> 17:16.953
There's something you need
to know about Vanessa.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.507
(glass shattering)

17:33.011 --> 17:34.929
(clattering)

17:34.971 --> 17:36.556
Hold it right there!
I'm armed.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.140
It's me, you idiot.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.602
Well, I'm kind of digging the
whole Charlie's Angels thing,

17:41.644 --> 17:43.646
but why wouldn't you
just take the stairs?

17:43.688 --> 17:47.525
Because my sister
is an evil bitch.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.569
If she wants to play
dirty to get PJ,

17:49.610 --> 17:51.487
I can play dirty.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.697
When do you see him next?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.657
Tomorrow we're going
to Desert Valley to sell bags.

17:54.699 --> 17:55.742
Perfect.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.117
Annie,

17:57.159 --> 17:58.870
I think it's
finally time.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.582
I'm gonna wear... the dress.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.583
Wait, what?

18:03.624 --> 18:05.043
I didn't even think

18:05.084 --> 18:07.503
that the dress was real.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.380
I mean, I know you talk
about it all the time,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.257
but I just thought it was
this urban fashion legend.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.885
You know how religious freaks
feel about their virginity?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.970
That's how I feel
about the dress.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.805
I have been saving it
for the perfect guy,

18:17.847 --> 18:20.725
and PJ is the perfect guy.

at the same festival as Train.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.854
We're in the big leagues now.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.188
Oh, okay.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.314
Can I get a little help?

19:50.356 --> 19:51.816
Uh, it's all yours.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.485
Shouldn't PJ be here
to help you with these bags?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.529
He's taking a helicopter later

19:56.570 --> 20:00.033

give him motion sickness.

talking about?

20:09.583 --> 20:10.918
What am I gonna wear?
We're like 50 miles

20:10.960 --> 20:13.587
from a store, and I can't
let PJ see me in sweats.

a fifth time?

(exhales)

20:49.415 --> 20:50.958
Okay, you're right.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.502
I don't want to make waves,
and I know this is weird,

20:53.544 --> 20:56.589
but did you...

20:56.630 --> 21:00.300
Did you hire that girl for me
to rescue at the charity event?

21:00.342 --> 21:02.469
That's ridiculous.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.180
Well, why would you
think that?

21:04.222 --> 21:05.556
Adrianna told me
she was an actress.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.266
She thinks that you
staged the whole thing

21:07.307 --> 21:08.893
so that I would
look like a hero

21:08.935 --> 21:10.978
and get some attention
from Hollywood people.

21:11.020 --> 21:15.024
And you believed her.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.568
(chuckles) Look, it's just
with all the stuff with Annie,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.779
and now this, I don't
know what to believe.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.030
Well, I do.

21:21.072 --> 21:24.158
You rescued an actress
at a charity gala

21:24.200 --> 21:26.077
in Hollywood.

21:26.119 --> 21:29.080
That's like spotting
an attitude in New York.

21:29.122 --> 21:32.374
And as for your friend,

21:32.416 --> 21:33.834
Adrianna,

21:33.876 --> 21:36.129
look, I don't know what kind of
a crazy person spreads rumors

21:36.170 --> 21:37.630
about people.
She's not crazy.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.050
Really? You've told me
the stories yourself.

21:41.092 --> 21:42.426
The pill swapping,

21:42.468 --> 21:45.179
the pool fights, the stealing
dead Mexican pop star songs?

21:45.221 --> 21:47.807
I'm telling you, that
girl has it out for me.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.767
Look, I know Adrianna.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.227
She's worked hard to earn

21:51.269 --> 21:52.561
everybody's forgiveness,
and I trust her.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.064
More that you trust me?

21:55.106 --> 21:56.023
I didn't say that.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.524
You didn't have to.

So please give me

22:33.519 --> 22:34.687

22:34.728 --> 22:36.354
Ooh.
Where...

22:36.396 --> 22:37.940
Where did you get that?

22:37.982 --> 22:39.150
Just over at the pop-up market.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.235
Some hippie freaks
were selling their crap.

22:41.277 --> 22:44.446
Okay, I'll see
you guys later.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.823
What's wrong with her?

22:45.865 --> 22:47.867
Well, I said, "Some hippie
freaks were selling their crap."

22:47.908 --> 22:50.036
She probably wanted
to go be with her people.

22:50.077 --> 22:50.828
(laughs)

22:50.870 --> 22:52.246
(gasps)

22:59.337 --> 23:02.048
Oh...
I'm so not getting
involved with this.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.590
Good luck. Don't
get arrested.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.801
I love the ensemble,
Naomi, but I do think

23:05.843 --> 23:08.137
the clown costume would have
looked a little better.

23:08.179 --> 23:11.598
I don't need the dress
to win PJ.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.600
You know, I do admire
your confidence.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.811
It reminds me of how convinced
Jacques was

23:15.853 --> 23:17.980
that he could walk
when he was eight months old.

23:18.022 --> 23:18.939
He was positively adorable

23:18.981 --> 23:20.607
when he kept falling
on his face.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.110
Ladies, have you
seen Annie?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.946
I'm supposed to help her
with the bags. Wow.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.740
You look... Wow.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.658
That is a bold choice
for an outdoor concert.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.160
But you know what?
I like bold.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.161
Thank you.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.287
Oh...

23:33.329 --> 23:34.496
There she is.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.999
Naomi, you look
spectacular as always.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.459
Oh, you noticed.
Thank you.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.920
Yeah. You know,
isn't it charming

23:40.961 --> 23:42.171
when girls feel like they have

23:42.213 --> 23:44.173
to walk around half-naked
in order to get attention?

23:44.215 --> 23:46.050
Oh, well, you know what I say.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.844
If you have it, flaunt it.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.721
And I always say
that if you feel

23:50.763 --> 23:54.808
the need to advertise it,
it probably isn't worth buying.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.936
Girls, as much as I love
a little healthy competition,

23:56.977 --> 23:59.772
my father wants me
to call him.

23:59.813 --> 24:03.109
There's some sort of wine
emergency happening
at the vineyard.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.694
So, I will catch up
with you... and you

24:05.736 --> 24:08.239
(chuckles)
in a few minutes.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.241
I hope it works out.

24:10.283 --> 24:11.658
Me, too!

24:11.700 --> 24:14.412
Oh, my God,

Look at what
she did to me.

25:23.481 --> 25:25.983
Look at what she did to me.
It's not what you think, okay?

25:26.025 --> 25:26.984
She did this to herself.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.445
Ha! I just came in here

25:29.487 --> 25:31.322
to wish her good luck,

25:31.364 --> 25:34.116
and then she started
accusing me of
sabotaging

25:34.158 --> 25:36.285
some meeting, and then
she started hitting me.

25:36.327 --> 25:37.744
I told you

25:37.786 --> 25:39.246
she was out
to get me.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.664
How could you do this?

25:40.706 --> 25:42.540
And after everything
I've done for you?

25:42.582 --> 25:43.834
I even defended you.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.879
Do you really think
Adrianna would beat Vanessa up?

25:46.920 --> 25:49.547
She's making this up
because I'm onto her, okay?

25:49.589 --> 25:51.967
She called the same
time as the Def Jam
producer called

25:52.009 --> 25:53.135
to set up the meeting.
She set us up!

25:53.177 --> 25:55.637
I called to convince her
to come back to work

25:55.679 --> 25:57.473
because we were slammed
after you quit.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.479
Why don't you tell him how
you found out about the call?

26:03.521 --> 26:06.148
She stole my purse
and went through my phone.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.526
Adrianna wouldn't do that.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.029
Would you?

26:12.071 --> 26:14.323
I mean, yeah,
that part is true.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.450
But I didn't
beat her up.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.951
Hey, I'm sorry
to interrupt,

26:17.993 --> 26:21.372
but I have to take you
to security for questioning.
Now?

26:21.414 --> 26:23.790
I mean, can we at
least perform first?

26:23.832 --> 26:25.209
It you don't
come with me,

26:25.251 --> 26:28.045
I'm gonna have
to call the police.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.672
ADRIANNA:
Oh, my...

26:30.714 --> 26:32.299
You covered for me once.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.385
I'll cover for
you now, okay?

26:53.404 --> 26:54.905
(sniffles)

26:54.947 --> 26:56.490
I'm glad you're okay.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.950
(door closes)

27:00.327 --> 27:04.957
Bag? Really cute bag
for charity.

27:04.998 --> 27:08.085
So, some stoner
over there

27:08.127 --> 27:09.920
actually had the
audacity to try

27:09.962 --> 27:11.964
and sell some
street artist work.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.424
So I stole back
his stencils.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.593
Where are your
signs at?

27:15.633 --> 27:17.511
Uh, PJ was supposed
to bring them,

27:17.553 --> 27:18.845
and he didn't
even show up.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.598
Naomi probably
intercepted him.

27:20.638 --> 27:23.350
That's annoying. Well,
how are the sales going?

27:23.392 --> 27:24.851
Mm, you mean the sale?

27:24.893 --> 27:27.229
Now, the charity's off
to a really strong start

27:27.271 --> 27:29.064
with $20 in the pot.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.274
I'm sorry, Annie.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.649
That is so frustrating.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.777
You know, it's like you can't
even sell something

27:33.819 --> 27:35.321
that actually matters;
meanwhile,

27:35.362 --> 27:38.324
some douche bag over there
is selling somebody else's...

27:38.365 --> 27:39.992
Anyway, Dixon
should be on soon,

27:40.033 --> 27:42.786
and I should probably
close up shop.

27:42.828 --> 27:43.912
You coming?

27:43.954 --> 27:46.039
Yeah, just give me a minute.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.464
Hey.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.590
Hey, yourself.

27:54.632 --> 27:58.135
Look, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.095
I did not mean to
put all that on you.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.598
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I wasn't very helpful.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.184
It just kind of caught me
off guard, you know?

28:05.225 --> 28:07.645
Yeah, kind of did
the same to me.

28:07.685 --> 28:10.063
Yeah, I can see
how it could be scary.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.608
If you've got the BRCA gene,
your risk of getting cancer

28:12.650 --> 28:16.987
is, like, five times
more than other girls.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.071
How do you know that?

28:18.113 --> 28:20.240
Um, it's this little
thing called Google.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.826
(chuckles) Did you
research it for me?

28:22.868 --> 28:24.453
Well, it's the least
I could do

28:24.495 --> 28:26.246
after how I reacted
the other day.

28:28.541 --> 28:30.501
Silver, I'm there for you.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.919
Whatever you need,
I'm your guy.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.965
All I need is to forget
about the stupid test.

28:37.007 --> 28:39.552
Can you make that happen?

28:39.593 --> 28:43.138
Maybe I can.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.265
You want to go for a ride?

28:46.099 --> 28:48.227
(Silver shrieks)

28:48.268 --> 28:50.563
(laughing):
Oh, my God!

28:50.604 --> 28:51.813
(shrieks)

28:51.855 --> 28:53.940
(laughs)

28:55.150 --> 28:57.653
Are you all right?
Yeah.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.655
That was amazing.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.240
Yeah, it was.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.290
(sighs)

29:10.332 --> 29:13.502
You're still thinking about
the test, aren't you?

29:13.544 --> 29:14.961
(exhales)

29:15.003 --> 29:16.922
I'm still thinking
about the test.

29:16.963 --> 29:20.676
Well, if you can't enjoy
life without knowing,

29:20.718 --> 29:23.011
then maybe you
should take it.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.972
I mean, knowing
can't be much worse
than this, right?

29:32.979 --> 29:34.690
(sighs)

29:37.359 --> 29:39.653
JEN: Naomi?

29:39.695 --> 29:40.779
Go away, Jen.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.322
Have you seen Preston?

29:42.364 --> 29:44.824
No. I was certain
you'd stolen him
from me already.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.452
I don't steal things;
I earn them.

29:46.493 --> 29:50.080
Oh, really?
Like you earned Ethan
and like you earned Liam?

29:50.122 --> 29:52.207
I'm not gonna let you
steal another guy from me.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.917
PJ is mine, so back
the hell off.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.252
I can't even--
first of all--

29:55.294 --> 29:56.712
believe you would
bring up those names.

29:56.754 --> 29:59.047
We have both
made mistakes.
We've made mistakes?

29:59.089 --> 30:01.133
No, no, no, no,
you've made mistakes.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.884
I'm tired of dealing with them.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.511
Are you jealous of
me or something?

30:04.553 --> 30:05.804
Jealous?
(laughs)

30:05.845 --> 30:07.431
As far as I can see,

30:07.473 --> 30:10.392
you are the same vapid,
narcissistic,

30:10.434 --> 30:12.561
self-aggrandizing
bitch as you ever were.

30:12.603 --> 30:15.230
Huh. I don't know what on Earth
I would be jealous of you for.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.816
The fact that I am actually
making something of myself,

30:17.857 --> 30:22.446
and you're still an ageing
single mother without a friend,

30:22.488 --> 30:24.698
without love or even sex
in her life!

30:24.740 --> 30:27.242
Oh! I do not believe
you would just go there!

30:27.284 --> 30:28.243
Oh! Oh!

30:28.285 --> 30:29.495
(screaming)

30:29.536 --> 30:32.080
(both screaming)

30:33.373 --> 30:35.208
Crazy bitch!

30:35.250 --> 30:36.335
(screaming)

30:36.376 --> 30:37.544
Bitch!

30:37.586 --> 30:40.506
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

30:40.547 --> 30:41.674
(grunting)

30:45.051 --> 30:46.512
What are you doing?!

30:46.553 --> 30:48.597
Stop it! (shrieks)

30:50.098 --> 30:52.934
Oh, my God, that is it!

30:52.976 --> 30:57.564
I am so done with your
stupid fight over PJ!

30:57.606 --> 30:59.358
You guys are acting
like you're 12!

30:59.399 --> 31:01.026
When are you gonna grow
the hell up?!

31:01.067 --> 31:02.361
(spits)

31:02.402 --> 31:05.322
I wish he was here
right now so that
he could see this

31:05.364 --> 31:08.534
and see how crazy
the both of you are!

31:08.575 --> 31:10.285
What are you
talking about?
Where is he?

31:10.327 --> 31:13.622
He went to Napa on
the helicopter an hour ago!

31:21.547 --> 31:24.049
EMCEE: Our next act is
a local L.A. duo.

31:24.090 --> 31:27.093
For the first time on
the Desert Valley stage,

31:27.135 --> 31:29.137
please welcome Dixon
and Adrianna.

31:29.179 --> 31:30.848
(cheering)

31:34.309 --> 31:39.648
Uh... (clears throat)

31:39.690 --> 31:42.317
Um, th-thank you.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.777
Thank you for coming out.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.349
I'm sorry for saying

32:56.391 --> 32:58.351
you don't have love
or sex in your life.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.686
Don't be-- it's true.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.521
You know, I think,
actually,

33:01.563 --> 33:03.565
a part of me is
jealous of you.

33:03.607 --> 33:06.902
You have so many people in
your life who just love you.

33:06.944 --> 33:10.071
And me, I am in
my late mid-20s

33:10.113 --> 33:13.909
with a car seat in the
back of my Bentley

33:13.951 --> 33:18.330
and no close friends or
family really to speak of.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.123
You have me.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.875
Do I?

33:22.835 --> 33:24.753
Always.

33:24.795 --> 33:27.255
And I'm jealous
of you, too.

33:27.297 --> 33:31.802
Your post-baby body
is a bit ridiculous.

33:31.844 --> 33:34.471
Seriously,
how many moms

33:34.513 --> 33:37.683
look hotter after
than they did before?

33:38.642 --> 33:40.435
You can have Preston.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.770
You deserve him

33:41.812 --> 33:43.522
far more than I do.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.525
Jen.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.318
And you know
what the crazy part is?

33:48.360 --> 33:49.695
The tarot card reader was right.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.655
The truth would
be revealed

33:51.697 --> 33:53.657
in a heated, passionate roll.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.450
(laughing):
Oh!
Granted,

33:55.492 --> 33:57.911
I thought it would be
in bed with Preston, but...

33:57.953 --> 33:59.078
the mud will do.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.288
Well, she wasn't right
about everything.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.999
She said I was going to get
my heart broken

34:02.040 --> 34:03.000
by the one I loved most.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.417
Well, thank goodness for that.

34:06.252 --> 34:09.088
I'm going to go back to L.A.
and see Jacques.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.174
You enjoy some time
with your friends, okay?

34:12.759 --> 34:13.969
Oh.

34:14.011 --> 34:14.969
Um... yeah.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.304
You're going
to get me muddy.

34:16.346 --> 34:17.639
Uh, yeah, all right.
Good-bye.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.629
Long story.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.297
Uh, how did you get
all these people here?

34:52.340 --> 34:54.217
Well, turns
out your bag

34:54.259 --> 34:56.261
just needed a little bit
of street cred to sell.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.638
Which I happen to have
a lot of right now.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.306
Wait. All that graffiti
around town's yours?

35:00.348 --> 35:03.101
It's not graffiti; it's....
I mean, it's street art.

35:03.142 --> 35:05.562
Oh, I got to say
it's pretty badass.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.106
DIEGO: It's
totally badass.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.777
Hey.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.201
Oh, hey.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.369
That performance

35:21.411 --> 35:23.204
was not what I
was expecting.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.414
It was better.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.874
Really?

35:25.916 --> 35:26.959
Thanks.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.710
Oh, this is my colleague,
Carter.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.169
Oh, hey.
Great job tonight.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.630
Thank you.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.007
We want to sign you
to a record contract.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.094
Are... are
you serious?
Yes.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.553
(laughs)

35:38.595 --> 35:40.013
Uh... (grunts)

35:40.055 --> 35:42.599
Uh, I can't wait
to tell Ade.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.684
Uh, yeah, it's...
it's not for her.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.728
It's for you--
alone.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.771
MARILYN: Tonight,
Adrianna proved

35:47.813 --> 35:49.314
that she's not
dependable,

35:49.355 --> 35:52.150
and you proved that you
don't need her onstage.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.821
Um...

35:55.862 --> 35:58.239
yeah, but...
but-but we're a team.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.659
Then go ahead and
be a team player,

36:00.700 --> 36:03.411
but you won't have
a contract with us.

36:03.453 --> 36:05.664
Carter,
let's go.

36:09.960 --> 36:14.089
Look, relationships are about
compromise, too, right?

36:14.131 --> 36:16.008
And I've been
thinking about the...

36:16.049 --> 36:17.092
the girlfriend thing.

36:17.134 --> 36:20.053
Yeah, look, about
that-- um...

36:21.346 --> 36:24.141
I went from being
somebody's girlfriend

36:24.182 --> 36:27.102
to being married,
and then separated

36:27.144 --> 36:28.520
all in the last year.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.105
I'm... I don't know--
I'm still trying

36:30.147 --> 36:31.815
to figure out what
normal dating is like.

36:31.857 --> 36:35.568
So... maybe I did kind of
overreact yesterday.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.071
You don't have to apologize.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.531
You were right.

36:39.572 --> 36:42.241
I do look at most things
the same way I look at art--

36:42.283 --> 36:44.119
temporary,
in the moment,

36:44.161 --> 36:47.205
just for today, you know--
but not you.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.290
When I look at you,

36:49.332 --> 36:51.209
I think about more
than just the moment.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.627
I think
about the future.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.004
And that's
something I...

36:54.046 --> 36:57.049
I don't want to have
painted over, you know?

36:57.090 --> 36:58.717
And I think
there's a word for...

36:58.758 --> 37:00.468
for someone who makes you
feel like that.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.803
Yeah?

37:01.845 --> 37:03.763
So, if it's okay
with you,

37:03.805 --> 37:06.058
can I call you
my girlfriend?

37:06.099 --> 37:08.309
Yes, please.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.400
You ready?

37:15.441 --> 37:17.402
(whooping)

37:23.742 --> 37:25.577
Hey.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.787
Hey.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.123
So... how'd it go
with security?

37:30.165 --> 37:32.291
(sighs) I think I
finally convinced them

37:32.333 --> 37:33.960
that Vanessa set me up.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.547
Yeah, that, uh, girl
is all kinds of crazy.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.132
(both chuckling)

37:39.174 --> 37:42.677
Our music is the only thing
I have going for me right now,

37:42.719 --> 37:46.014
and the fact that Vanessa
just set us up to fail...

37:47.140 --> 37:49.392
Anyways, it's over now.

37:49.434 --> 37:53.354
From now on, it's just me,
you and our music.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.442
Oh, my God.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.486
That record producer must think
I'm the biggest flake.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.530
Do you think
I should go apologize?

38:02.572 --> 38:05.117
No. Uh... no.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.910
I mean, um, maybe not.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.661
You know, uh...

38:08.703 --> 38:10.329
she's probably
long gone anyway.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.664
(sighs)

38:11.706 --> 38:13.374
I really hope she liked it.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.835
Do you think we'll ever
hear from her again?

38:15.877 --> 38:19.005
Uh... I don't know.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.638
(sighs)

38:31.226 --> 38:32.936
(sighs) Well...

38:32.978 --> 38:36.481
I got to say, I learned
a valuable lesson today.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.650
That, if your event
planning business fails,

38:38.691 --> 38:41.236
you always have a fallback
career in mud wrestling?

38:41.278 --> 38:43.822
(chuckles) No.

38:43.863 --> 38:48.534
That I don't want to
play games anymore.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.204
Not with my sister, not with PJ.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.248
I trust our connection--
it's real.

38:53.290 --> 38:54.707
And the next
time I see him,

38:54.749 --> 38:57.836
I'm just going to ask him out.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.838
(chuckling)

38:59.879 --> 39:01.673
What's that?

39:01.714 --> 39:02.882
Oh, it's from Jen.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.092
Oh.

39:04.134 --> 39:07.345
"Dearest Naomi, Jacques and I
need some time away.

39:07.386 --> 39:11.183
I thought the Napa Valley would
be just the place to relax."

39:14.727 --> 39:16.980
Oh, she's following PJ.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.065
I'm so sorry, Naomi.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.984
She lied to me.

39:22.152 --> 39:25.905
She... she doesn't care
about me at all.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.451
I guess Sybil was right.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.289
I just didn't think
it would be Jen

39:34.331 --> 39:35.748
who would break my heart.

39:38.626 --> 39:42.172
♪ ♪

39:42.214 --> 39:43.173
(knock at door)

39:43.215 --> 39:45.217
Yeah.
Hey. Ready for
you on set.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.634
Okay.

39:46.676 --> 39:48.386
You're looking
very action star-y.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.680
Ah, well, that is the idea.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.478
Hey, um...

39:57.520 --> 39:59.356
thank you for everything.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.733
Last night really
helped me.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.443
I'm going to
take the test.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.697
Well, if that's what you want,
I think that's a good idea.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.033
It is what I want. Yeah.

40:10.075 --> 40:14.371
I just, uh...
I don't really want to go alone.

40:16.831 --> 40:17.999
Would you...

40:18.041 --> 40:20.377
go with me?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.587
Of course.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.880
Yeah?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.298
Thanks.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.052
(clears throat)

40:29.094 --> 40:30.970
(laughs)

40:31.012 --> 40:32.972
Before I know
any more,

40:33.014 --> 40:34.266
let's just
keep this

40:34.307 --> 40:35.474
between the two
of us, okay?

40:35.516 --> 40:37.143
Absolutely.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.687
Thanks.

40:42.899 --> 40:44.525
Let's go.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.694
Hey.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.821
Have you seen Liam?
Yeah.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.157
Yeah, he's in his trailer
with the new P.A.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.325
But knock first.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.452
They've been spending
a lot of time together lately.

40:54.493 --> 40:55.912
(chuckles)

41:09.926 --> 41:11.136
Hey.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.305
So what's up with Silver?

41:13.346 --> 41:15.056
Uh... nothing.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.724
We were just talking.

41:16.766 --> 41:28.694
Come on.
