00:01.813 --> 00:02.980
Dad, what are you doing here?

00:03.007 --> 00:04.680
- Working reception.
- Why?

00:04.713 --> 00:06.721
If people find out,
then my dad'll find out.

00:06.756 --> 00:07.816
Seth died.

00:07.817 --> 00:09.318
I want to take her out on a date.

00:09.352 --> 00:10.675
This is my race, not yours.

00:10.709 --> 00:11.954
Not everything is about you.

00:11.988 --> 00:13.503
I recognize him from my patrols.

00:13.538 --> 00:15.299
He lives on the street.
I can keep an eye on him.

00:15.323 --> 00:17.436
I just wanted to say I'm not
the kid next door anymore.

00:17.460 --> 00:19.394
Couldn't sleep without
getting that off my chest.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.144
Have you ever grabbed a doorknob

00:25.168 --> 00:27.609
or gone to push an elevator
button and you get shocked?

00:27.644 --> 00:28.744
Hey, hon.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.006
It's usually just a little zap,
nothing big.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.240
Nothing to worry about.

00:32.275 --> 00:34.186
I stopped by in between
meetings to surprise you,

00:34.210 --> 00:35.177
and you're not here.

00:35.211 --> 00:36.211
I had cabin fever,

00:36.245 --> 00:39.181
just sitting around
growing human life all day.

00:39.215 --> 00:41.060
Plus, all the power outages
are driving me nuts.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.185
Just be careful, please. No freeways.

00:43.219 --> 00:45.654
I can still race Vin Diesel
for pink slips, right?

00:45.688 --> 00:48.023
No. We can't risk losing the minivan.

00:48.992 --> 00:51.994
You know, technically,
I'm not on bed rest.

00:52.028 --> 00:53.505
The doctor just said, "Take it easy."

00:53.529 --> 00:54.963
Then take it easy.

00:54.998 --> 00:56.832
Electrical currents
are all over the place...

00:56.866 --> 00:59.401
Great. Now they fix the power.

00:59.435 --> 01:02.571
Safely encased in rubber
and hidden out of reach,

01:02.605 --> 01:03.739
but they're there.

01:05.742 --> 01:07.075
They're always there.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.217
Guess there's one perk
to your newly chosen profession.

01:15.251 --> 01:18.013
It's what happens when
you stop carrying a scalpel

01:18.014 --> 01:20.783
and start carrying a 50-pound hose pack

01:20.817 --> 01:22.718
up 10 flights of stairs.

01:22.753 --> 01:24.220
By myself.

01:24.254 --> 01:25.421
In the dark.

01:25.455 --> 01:26.989
Okay, don't try to impress me

01:27.023 --> 01:29.125
with your stamina, Benjamin Warren.

01:29.159 --> 01:31.894
Are you forgetting
how many hours it takes

01:31.928 --> 01:33.829
to resect a malignant meningioma?

01:33.864 --> 01:35.898
Which I did yesterday.

01:35.932 --> 01:37.500
On a step stool.

01:37.534 --> 01:42.171
Well, I kicked down a door.

01:42.205 --> 01:43.272
With a dead bolt.

01:43.306 --> 01:46.842
I tied off a bleeder with only two knots.

01:46.877 --> 01:48.911
I pulled four victims out of an accident.

01:48.945 --> 01:50.780
I puled four clots
out of a femoral artery.

01:50.814 --> 01:53.649
I stepped off the roof of a building

01:53.683 --> 01:57.319
maybe a full 10 seconds...

01:57.354 --> 01:59.088
before the whole...

01:59.122 --> 02:01.021
damn thing...

02:01.792 --> 02:03.565
collapsed.

02:06.863 --> 02:08.464
I love you.

02:08.497 --> 02:10.199
I love that you love what you're doing,

02:10.233 --> 02:17.206
but maybe let's not talk so much
about the danger part.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.642
Or the job part. For now.

02:19.676 --> 02:22.211
So, even if you feel good
and you feel safe...

02:22.245 --> 02:24.413
Maybe let's just stop talking.

02:25.315 --> 02:27.297
You never know, do you?

02:28.652 --> 02:31.020
If today's the day you might wind up...

02:33.890 --> 02:35.457
with a shock to your system?

02:40.096 --> 02:42.231
What are you doing here so early?

02:42.265 --> 02:44.200
Or just, what are you doing here?

02:44.234 --> 02:45.234
Bad news.

02:45.268 --> 02:47.751
Your incident report
was accidentally destroyed.

02:48.004 --> 02:50.406
So I sort of kind of
have to do another walk-through

02:50.440 --> 02:51.974
of your place.

02:52.008 --> 02:53.309
Sure.

02:59.203 --> 03:03.185
So, how have you been...
with... everything?

03:03.220 --> 03:06.388
You know, moving forward, moving on.

03:06.423 --> 03:07.823
Moving on?

03:07.858 --> 03:09.091
Yeah. Meaning?

03:09.125 --> 03:10.226
You are so obvious.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.028
You totally made up this whole
incident-report thing

03:13.063 --> 03:14.897
- to come over here and ask me out.
- No.

03:14.931 --> 03:16.042
So you don't want to ask me out.

03:16.066 --> 03:17.900
- That's not what I meant.
- So you do?

03:17.934 --> 03:20.870
I feel like any answer I give
is the wrong answer suddenly.

03:20.904 --> 03:23.182
You know, this could be construed
as extremely unprofessional.

03:23.206 --> 03:25.774
You might have to convince me not
to file an official complaint.

03:25.809 --> 03:28.210
Okay, let's be clear. I-I-I-I...

03:28.245 --> 03:29.945
Over Thai food.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.513
Tonight.

03:31.548 --> 03:33.015
And a bottle of red wine.

03:37.053 --> 03:38.020
Okay.

03:38.054 --> 03:39.722
"Okay"?

03:39.756 --> 03:41.257
Okay.

03:48.064 --> 03:49.565
It's been 48 hours. Not a word.

03:49.599 --> 03:51.800
Now your dad's calling us in
early to "talk"?

03:51.835 --> 03:53.102
Yeah, well, he's mad.

03:53.136 --> 03:54.937
He goes quiet when he's mad.

03:54.971 --> 03:56.174
A lot like you.

03:56.209 --> 03:57.383
You're the one who ended things.

03:57.407 --> 03:58.551
- Not much else to say.
- Really?

03:58.575 --> 04:01.043
When you're the one who called
things a waste of time?

04:08.618 --> 04:09.785
You're both adults.

04:09.819 --> 04:12.054
You can technically do what you want,

04:12.088 --> 04:15.124
but it disturbs me
that you never considered

04:15.158 --> 04:18.160
the consequences of your actions,

04:18.194 --> 04:21.327
what it would mean, not just
to me, but to the station.

04:21.932 --> 04:23.432
If I had known about the two of you,

04:23.466 --> 04:25.935
I would've never put you both up
for the captain position.

04:25.969 --> 04:26.902
You're trying to lead this station.

04:26.937 --> 04:30.139
This team puts their trust
in you blindly.

04:30.173 --> 04:33.309
You don't deserve their trust if
you can't be honest with them.

04:33.343 --> 04:36.478
You need to come clean with them
about your...

04:36.513 --> 04:38.013
whatever it is.

04:38.048 --> 04:41.016
Immediately. Yourselves.
Or I will do it for you.

04:41.051 --> 04:43.085
Dad, it's not happening anymore.

04:43.119 --> 04:46.155
You walked in on us
deciding to call it off, so...

04:46.189 --> 04:47.222
So, what?

04:47.257 --> 04:49.097
You want to pretend
there was nothing going on?

04:49.125 --> 04:51.961
You're the two who are fighting
to captain this place.

04:51.995 --> 04:53.095
What do you think?

04:53.129 --> 04:56.198
Is that how you want to lead
this station, on a lie?

05:00.036 --> 05:06.915
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

05:08.378 --> 05:10.145
Aid Car 19.

05:10.180 --> 05:11.547
Response, medical.

05:11.581 --> 05:12.740
Assist police.

05:12.775 --> 05:14.516
- I didn't realize you were...
- Me either.

05:14.551 --> 05:16.545
I figured I'd jump on the raid,

05:16.579 --> 05:18.187
get out of the station for a while.

05:18.221 --> 05:20.055
But I can switch with Trav or Dean.

05:20.090 --> 05:21.334
You don't have to do that. I can switch.

05:21.358 --> 05:22.891
No, no, no. Don't be silly.

05:22.926 --> 05:25.392
So you and I are together today.

05:26.429 --> 05:28.130
Then I guess we should go.

05:28.164 --> 05:29.298
Yeah.

05:30.400 --> 05:34.169
So, hold on. Herrera and Bishop
are on a stakeout.

05:34.204 --> 05:35.738
Like a... Like a stakeout-stakeout?

05:35.772 --> 05:37.383
It's standard procedure
if cops are planning a bust

05:37.407 --> 05:38.417
where somebody could get hurt.

05:38.441 --> 05:40.509
It's pretty routine.
Happens like once a month.

05:40.543 --> 05:42.355
- Roll call, everybody.
- I want to go on a stakeout.

05:42.379 --> 05:44.346
- Same.
- Mnh-mnh. Nope. No, you don't.

05:44.381 --> 05:46.548
It takes hours of just
sitting there doing nothing.

05:46.583 --> 05:49.852
Until something awesome happens
and a swarm of good guys run in,

05:49.886 --> 05:51.186
yells at some bad guys,

05:51.221 --> 05:54.156
and then somebody busts through
a giant glass window on a rope.

05:54.190 --> 05:56.270
Yeah, you know, I'm sure
it goes down just like that.

05:57.193 --> 05:58.560
Guys, come on. Let's get going.

05:58.595 --> 06:00.206
Stakeouts so nobody
will bring up the fact

06:00.230 --> 06:01.273
that he went to JJ's house this morning.

06:01.297 --> 06:03.098
- What?!
- You didn't want to lead with that?

06:03.133 --> 06:05.267
Guys!

06:05.301 --> 06:06.616
Roll call.

06:08.304 --> 06:10.539
I think today's a good time for inventory

06:10.573 --> 06:12.241
and routine maintenance checks.

06:12.275 --> 06:13.942
Every tool, every hose.

06:13.977 --> 06:17.046
Jack, what happened to doing
things on our own schedule?

06:17.080 --> 06:18.680
That's a very good question, Travis.

06:18.715 --> 06:21.016
Maybe Gibson is rethinking his approach

06:21.051 --> 06:23.419
of doing whatever he wants
whenever he wants.

06:27.490 --> 06:29.224
Warren, you're on hoses.

06:29.259 --> 06:30.348
Montgomery, check the rigs.

06:30.382 --> 06:32.194
Hughes and Miller, tool maintenance.

06:32.228 --> 06:35.264
And for me today, Gibson?

06:35.298 --> 06:37.633
Well, you're at reception, sir.

06:37.667 --> 06:38.700
Same as always.

06:38.735 --> 06:39.835
Very good.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.241
Chore time. Let's see that hustle.

06:48.111 --> 06:49.244
Let's go.

06:56.252 --> 06:57.252
You're late.

06:58.321 --> 07:00.122
- Hey, Bishop.
- Tanner.

07:00.156 --> 07:02.224
Come on. Briefing's already started.

07:02.258 --> 07:03.836
We've staked out a warehouse
a few blocks from here.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.471
The target, who we've
code-named the Big Boss,

07:05.495 --> 07:06.462
is a drug trafficker.

07:06.496 --> 07:07.930
He and his crew will arrive soon

07:07.964 --> 07:09.465
and make a buy from our undercovers.

07:09.499 --> 07:11.600
We move in,
and local PD makes the arrest.

07:11.634 --> 07:13.135
Questions? Good.

07:13.169 --> 07:15.737
Everyone be on their radios
and be ready to move.

07:15.772 --> 07:17.149
The important thing is to stay here

07:17.173 --> 07:19.132
until we give you
the green light to move in.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.910
These guys are dangerous, so do not
move in until you hear from us.

07:21.945 --> 07:23.445
Dangerous? Dangerous how?

07:23.480 --> 07:24.580
Like, could we get shot?

07:24.614 --> 07:26.592
- Do we need bulletproof vests?
- You don't need vests.

07:26.616 --> 07:28.127
They're gonna barge in, arrest the guy,

07:28.151 --> 07:30.185
and then congratulate themselves

07:30.220 --> 07:31.931
with high fives or butt-slapping
or whatever,

07:31.955 --> 07:33.199
and the whole time, we're never
gonna leave this lot.

07:33.223 --> 07:34.957
We're just gonna sit here
and then go home.

07:34.991 --> 07:36.108
We're like earthquake insurance.

07:36.132 --> 07:38.026
Don't really need it,
but it's nice to have.

07:38.061 --> 07:40.005
She's right. Except for the butt thing.
We don't do that.

07:40.029 --> 07:43.198
Set your radios for Ds2.
Stay in your vehicle.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.334
Do not get out or leave for any reason.

07:45.368 --> 07:47.002
Time to get comfortable.

07:52.876 --> 07:55.611
So, now we just, sit here?

07:55.645 --> 07:58.347
How could you possibly
have another question?

07:58.381 --> 08:00.983
I'm sorry. I just prefer
to have all the information

08:01.017 --> 08:02.618
instead of being left in the dark.

08:03.853 --> 08:06.955
Maybe some of us function better
when we're given a heads-up

08:06.990 --> 08:09.057
about the things we should know
from our friends.

08:09.092 --> 08:10.692
Ryan's your friend now?

08:10.727 --> 08:12.294
Is he yours?

08:12.328 --> 08:15.063
Because last time I checked,
friends don't belittle each other,

08:15.098 --> 08:16.203
especially not in front
of their co-workers.

08:16.227 --> 08:17.576
Belittle? What are you talking about?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.868
You were so dismissive just now.

08:19.903 --> 08:21.503
High fives? Butt-slapping?

08:21.538 --> 08:23.315
- Really?
- I've... I've known him a long time.

08:23.339 --> 08:25.551
- I promise you, he wasn't offended.
- You don't know that.

08:25.575 --> 08:27.576
My God.
Why are we fighting about this?

08:27.610 --> 08:29.211
- What is this?
- Talk to me. Please.

08:29.245 --> 08:30.312
- No.
- Why not?

08:30.346 --> 08:31.313
Why would I talk to you
when you're acting like this?

08:31.347 --> 08:34.683
- I'm not acting like anything.
- Yes, you are.

08:34.717 --> 08:36.361
Can you please just tell me
what's going on

08:36.385 --> 08:37.696
so we can deal with it and figure it out?

08:37.720 --> 08:38.746
Sure. Of course.

08:38.782 --> 08:40.389
Let's get my stuff out of the way

08:40.423 --> 08:43.058
so we can circle back around
to deal with yours.

08:43.092 --> 08:45.527
Wow. Okay.

08:45.562 --> 08:46.995
Let's not talk, then.

08:47.030 --> 08:49.364
Okay.

08:54.771 --> 08:56.338
This will help you guys keep tabs.

08:56.372 --> 08:58.050
It's a live feed
from inside the warehouse.

08:58.074 --> 08:59.441
We're about to go radio silent.

08:59.475 --> 09:00.909
Don't want them getting ears on us.

09:00.944 --> 09:02.678
Just got word the Big Boss
could be close,

09:02.712 --> 09:04.346
so we're moving into a closer position.

09:06.382 --> 09:08.483
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

09:08.518 --> 09:10.886
I don't usually see you
doing this part of your job.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.788
It's just... It's new. That's all.

09:12.822 --> 09:15.224
I mean, we don't do raids every day.

09:16.659 --> 09:18.070
You sure everything else is okay in here?

09:18.094 --> 09:19.928
Tanner, what's your status?

09:19.963 --> 09:21.863
- Need you back.
- Got to go.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.465
- Eyes on the tablet.
- Yep.

09:33.270 --> 09:34.470
Okay, is it me,

09:34.505 --> 09:37.473
or is Captain Herrera's grumpy
level, like, grumpier today?

09:37.508 --> 09:40.210
Yeah, what was going on
with him and Jack at breakfast?

09:40.235 --> 09:41.546
I don't like tension with my granola.

09:41.570 --> 09:42.937
- Here.
- Toss me that wrench.

09:42.971 --> 09:45.072
- I just don't like granola.
- It's weird, right?

09:45.107 --> 09:46.941
I mean, there's definitely
something going on

09:46.975 --> 09:47.942
between him and Jack.

09:47.976 --> 09:49.584
How are those chores going?

09:49.618 --> 09:50.650
- Great.
- They're done.

09:50.685 --> 09:52.054
That's what we were talking
about were the chores.

09:52.078 --> 09:53.447
- There it is.
- Gibson!

09:53.482 --> 09:55.483
I've got a walk-in for you.

09:55.517 --> 09:56.611
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:56.645 --> 09:58.619
You guys install car seats, right,

09:58.654 --> 10:00.421
for women who are medically banned

10:00.455 --> 10:02.456
from lifting anything heavy
but married to men

10:02.491 --> 10:04.959
who tend to install even
toilet seats upside down?

10:04.993 --> 10:06.785
Of course.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.896
One of these guys can help you out.

10:08.931 --> 10:12.503
What's that thing, Warren, that
patients say at the hospital?

10:12.530 --> 10:14.197
When they want the best care,

10:14.231 --> 10:16.299
they request an attending
over a resident?

10:16.334 --> 10:19.969
Yeah, I'd be happy to
install the seat for you, ma'am.

10:20.004 --> 10:22.328
Great. Thank you. That's great.

10:22.362 --> 10:24.407
Also, I'm having triplets.

10:24.442 --> 10:26.109
So there are three.

10:26.911 --> 10:28.812
- Great.
- Great.

10:35.419 --> 10:38.088
Okay, I can feel you sitting
there wanting to talk to me.

10:38.122 --> 10:39.055
I know what it is.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.622
So you might as well
just tell me what it is

10:40.646 --> 10:41.952
and be done with it, okay?

10:41.986 --> 10:43.580
- So go.
- You know what what is?

10:43.615 --> 10:45.195
I saw Jack's shirt, Andy,

10:45.229 --> 10:47.443
on the ground outside
the captain's bedroom.

10:47.477 --> 10:49.042
- I know.
- You don't know the whole story.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.033
You weren't exactly hiding much.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.001
You're the one who seems
to be hiding something.

10:52.036 --> 10:55.105
You told me to shut up and back off.

10:55.139 --> 10:56.940
You told me this wasn't my race.

10:56.974 --> 10:59.701
So I have a tough moment
and you take it to this extreme?

10:59.702 --> 11:01.636
That was nothing.
I just needed a little space.

11:01.671 --> 11:03.248
- Which I've been giving.
- Yeah, while getting pissed about it.

11:03.272 --> 11:04.863
If you'd just talk to me...

11:04.888 --> 11:08.043
I don't talk to you because
I don't feel like I can.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.749
What are we even doing right now?

11:13.783 --> 11:16.218
I don't know.

11:16.252 --> 11:19.388
We've been friends since
we were probies together.

11:19.422 --> 11:22.415
We never fight. We never do this.

11:23.092 --> 11:25.927
If we didn't work together,
would we even be friends?

11:33.870 --> 11:36.038
What do you mean
I don't know the whole story?

11:37.774 --> 11:38.707
Don't worry.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.742
I'll double-check everything
once he's done.

11:40.777 --> 11:41.943
Fantastic.

11:41.978 --> 11:45.380
Listen, you should sit.

11:45.415 --> 11:47.516
We have beds or a sofa.

11:47.550 --> 11:48.861
There's no reason for you
to stay on your feet

11:48.885 --> 11:52.854
while Gibson takes this long to
install three simple car seats.

11:52.889 --> 11:55.223
You know, just 'cause I'm cooking babies

11:55.258 --> 11:56.792
doesn't mean I'm helpless.

11:56.826 --> 11:59.861
I am pretty awesomely strong, okay?

11:59.896 --> 12:02.297
Listen, your body
is working overtime now.

12:02.331 --> 12:04.199
Family first. Please, rest.

12:04.233 --> 12:07.269
Okay, maybe I could
put my feet up for a minute.

12:10.273 --> 12:11.273
Figured it out.

12:12.175 --> 12:13.475
Figured what out?

12:13.509 --> 12:14.743
Jack and Pruitt.

12:14.777 --> 12:15.911
Family first. Get it?

12:15.945 --> 12:17.913
As usual, you are speaking in a code

12:17.947 --> 12:19.714
that I only half understand.

12:19.749 --> 12:22.250
Family first.

12:22.285 --> 12:23.552
He picked sides.

12:23.586 --> 12:25.964
I think Pruitt told Jack that
he's no longer staying neutral.

12:25.988 --> 12:27.933
He's supporting his daughter
for captain with Frankel.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.724
And now Jack's mad.

12:29.759 --> 12:32.294
I mean, they probably had words.

12:32.328 --> 12:34.930
Like, bad words. Big, bad words.

12:34.964 --> 12:36.056
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:36.091 --> 12:37.995
- You think Pruitt picked a side?
- Yeah.

12:38.030 --> 12:40.068
- I don't buy it.
- Well, you don't have to buy it.

12:40.103 --> 12:42.304
I've seen what I've seen.
I've heard what I've heard.

12:42.338 --> 12:43.816
- And I'm right.
- But Jack's his guy.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.841
He's been his lieutenant
for like two years.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.776
And how long has Andy been his daughter?

12:47.810 --> 12:51.780
Hey, guys, I invited a guest
to lunch today.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.950
I'd like you all to meet
my wife, Dr. Miranda Bailey.

12:54.984 --> 12:57.018
- Hello.
- And so, that's Jack,

12:57.053 --> 12:59.254
Vic, Travis, and Dean.

12:59.288 --> 13:01.423
Yes, the Puppy Guy.

13:01.457 --> 13:03.758
I prefer Puppy Man.

13:03.793 --> 13:04.845
Okay.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.699
And, you already know...

13:06.733 --> 13:07.798
Dr. Bailey.

13:07.832 --> 13:12.801
Your wife is also one of my doctors.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.470
I did not put that together
until just now.

13:15.505 --> 13:16.705
Hello, Dr. Bailey.

13:16.739 --> 13:17.706
And what are you doing here

13:17.740 --> 13:19.975
instead of staying at home,
getting rested?

13:20.009 --> 13:23.845
So, what would you like
to know about things here?

13:23.880 --> 13:25.814
We're an open book. Ask us anything.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.682
For instance, are you aware

13:27.717 --> 13:30.218
that your husband flosses
a concerning amount?

13:31.721 --> 13:33.655
Station 19, response.

13:33.689 --> 13:34.689
Let's go.

13:35.725 --> 13:37.993
- Nice meeting you.
- Hey, just stay.

13:38.027 --> 13:39.794
- You stay.
- Okay.

13:39.829 --> 13:40.949
- Bye.
- We'll be right back.

13:44.734 --> 13:47.269
Please.

13:56.612 --> 13:57.723
I know what you're gonna say.

13:57.747 --> 14:00.815
I know that you know what
your last checkup indicated.

14:00.850 --> 14:03.919
You know that it showed your CBC
was borderline

14:03.953 --> 14:05.253
and getting worse.

14:05.288 --> 14:07.522
You are getting sicker,

14:07.557 --> 14:10.058
and I told you the best way to fight this

14:10.092 --> 14:11.826
is to stay home and rest.

14:11.861 --> 14:15.664
By ignoring my advice,
you are playing with fire.

14:15.698 --> 14:18.767
Okay, and you might think
that that's what you do

14:18.801 --> 14:20.769
or that you're invincible.

14:20.803 --> 14:23.438
I assure you, Mr. Herrera, you are not.

14:23.472 --> 14:30.078
So as your physician,
I mean it in the most alarmed,

14:30.112 --> 14:35.116
most concerned way possible
when I ask you again,

14:35.151 --> 14:37.886
what the hell are you doing here?

14:44.015 --> 14:45.564
- You're wrong.
- Nope. Try again.

14:45.589 --> 14:48.387
Coming here is the thing
that is keeping me going.

14:48.412 --> 14:50.046
If I have to sit at home and convalesce,

14:50.080 --> 14:51.814
that'll kill me faster
than anything else.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.752
I need to be here,
to work a desk, answer phones,

14:55.786 --> 14:58.721
to clean up after people's dumb choices.

14:58.756 --> 15:01.324
Being here is the best chance I've got.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.598
Surely you can understand that.

15:02.626 --> 15:04.527
I am worried about your numbers.

15:04.561 --> 15:06.095
I am, too.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.364
Okay, does anybody else here know?

15:11.568 --> 15:13.836
I'm a private person.

15:14.805 --> 15:17.740
Okay, I might...

15:17.775 --> 15:22.845
know a little of what it's like
to experience a medical setback

15:22.880 --> 15:27.517
and not want it to slow you down,

15:27.551 --> 15:29.919
so, hey, let me be clear.

15:29.953 --> 15:33.423
I do not approve of you
working here right now.

15:33.457 --> 15:36.526
Excuse me. Can I get a glass of water?

15:36.560 --> 15:37.737
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

15:37.761 --> 15:40.296
Here, why don't you have a
seat and let me check you out?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.431
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

15:41.465 --> 15:43.599
Yeah. I'm sure it's nothing.

15:43.634 --> 15:46.102
It's just what happens when
you're a walking incubator.

15:46.136 --> 15:48.604
Yes. Okay. Good, good.

15:48.639 --> 15:49.765
Thanks.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.942
Um... in the hospital, I'm your patient,

15:52.976 --> 15:54.877
but here in my house, this is what I do.

15:54.912 --> 15:55.978
May I?

15:56.013 --> 15:58.066
Well, you sit down, too.

15:59.183 --> 16:00.983
Okay.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.637
Say something.

16:06.671 --> 16:08.825
You're gonna air your dirty laundry

16:08.859 --> 16:10.727
to everyone at the station

16:10.761 --> 16:13.429
when we are weeks away from peer review?

16:13.464 --> 16:15.932
All your hard work
and leadership and talent?

16:15.966 --> 16:18.901
It'll all just be muddied up
and overshadowed

16:18.936 --> 16:20.837
by your stupid secret affair.

16:20.871 --> 16:23.806
- It didn't feel stupid.
- Andy, it's sloppy.

16:23.841 --> 16:27.777
Yeah, I get that now,
but when I'm with Jack,

16:27.811 --> 16:31.781
the way he sees me
for exactly who I am right now,

16:31.815 --> 16:35.284
not some kid he once knew,
not some idea he's chasing,

16:35.319 --> 16:37.688
just me, the way that makes me feel...

16:38.789 --> 16:39.956
I can't just shut it off.

16:39.990 --> 16:41.257
But you could've shut the door.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.659
I stop coaching you for 72 hours,

16:43.694 --> 16:46.095
and this is what happens?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.864
You are gonna...

16:47.898 --> 16:48.831
You're gonna lose this for us.

16:48.866 --> 16:50.032
- Us?
- Yes, us.

16:50.067 --> 16:53.169
You, me, womankind. Us.

16:53.203 --> 16:54.670
You know what? You know what?

16:54.705 --> 16:55.982
No more talking. No more talking.

16:56.006 --> 16:57.217
- We were finally not fighting.
- I know.

16:57.241 --> 16:58.341
But now I'm all worked up,

16:58.375 --> 17:00.009
and normally I would go for a run,

17:00.043 --> 17:02.278
and by the time I got back,
I wouldn't be as worked up,

17:02.312 --> 17:04.946
but we can't do that because
we are stuck in this damn car.

17:04.982 --> 17:09.519
So I am going to go for a run
in my head right now.

17:13.924 --> 17:15.825
- Okay, but...
- I-I am running.

17:15.858 --> 17:17.926
I will let you know when I am back.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.664
We are back, and we are hungry.

17:21.698 --> 17:22.464
That was quick.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.400
E-cigarette fire. No big deal.

17:25.736 --> 17:28.003
So, how many of you are married?

17:28.038 --> 17:31.174
Show of hands? Ever been married?

17:33.010 --> 17:36.045
And how did your spouses
enjoy your stories

17:36.079 --> 17:39.849
of fireballs and giant flames
and near-death experiences?

17:39.883 --> 17:42.552
Well, my... my
husband was a firefighter, too,

17:42.586 --> 17:43.920
so we used to have this really...

17:43.954 --> 17:45.688
Station 19. Response.

17:45.722 --> 17:47.590
Motor-vehicle accident.

17:47.624 --> 17:49.091
Wait. Again? Already?

17:49.126 --> 17:50.693
- Yep.
- No wonder you're slimming down.

17:50.727 --> 17:52.028
You never have time to eat.

17:52.062 --> 17:54.864
- Sorry. Got to go.
- Go on.

17:54.898 --> 17:57.010
I have a surgery, so I doubt
I'll be here when you get back.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.936
Um...

17:59.970 --> 18:01.737
Love you.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.243
Hey, man, I just want you to know

18:07.277 --> 18:09.879
that I know why Pruitt's
being such a pain to you.

18:12.879 --> 18:13.946
What do you mean?

18:13.971 --> 18:16.085
I mean, I know it can't be easy for you.

18:16.119 --> 18:19.088
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

18:19.122 --> 18:20.756
But I guess I'm not all that surprised.

18:20.791 --> 18:22.024
- You're not?
- Come on.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.093
Whole thing was pretty obvious, you know,

18:24.127 --> 18:25.344
that it would go this way

18:25.378 --> 18:27.363
and that Pruitt would feel
the way he feels.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.298
I didn't think
we were being that obvious.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.935
Thought Andy and I were pretty
good at hiding our relationship.

18:32.970 --> 18:36.806
Pruitt walking in,
that was just bad luck, I guess.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.742
I just wish he'd lay off
a little, you know?

18:39.776 --> 18:41.911
But, Travis, I mean this.

18:41.945 --> 18:44.080
I promise, Andy and me being together

18:44.114 --> 18:47.083
did not affect our.
Decisionmaking in any way.

18:47.117 --> 18:51.821
I don't want you to feel you
can't trust either one of us.

18:51.855 --> 18:54.123
Right. Right.

18:54.157 --> 18:56.325
I wasn't even thinking about that.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.227
Hey, thank you guys

18:58.262 --> 18:59.962
for being so welcoming to Miranda today.

18:59.997 --> 19:02.098
I-I really wanted her
to be able to put some faces

19:02.132 --> 19:03.209
to some of the names,

19:03.243 --> 19:04.734
get a feel for what we do every day.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.469
She, She gets worried

19:06.503 --> 19:08.804
about how dangerous this job can be,

19:08.839 --> 19:10.006
so it's good that she sees

19:10.040 --> 19:12.475
that it's as much about us
just hanging back, chilling out

19:12.509 --> 19:14.577
as it is about us
putting our lives in danger.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.078
I mean, I keep trying to tell her

19:16.113 --> 19:17.156
it's more about bandaging skinned knees

19:17.180 --> 19:18.214
and installing car seats

19:18.248 --> 19:21.517
than it is about us
doing anything... dangerous.

19:21.551 --> 19:22.919
Boy.

19:25.889 --> 19:27.156
Help!

19:28.525 --> 19:30.159
Help me!

19:33.830 --> 19:35.131
Help me, please!

19:35.832 --> 19:36.899
Help!

19:36.934 --> 19:39.001
- Warren, you were saying?
- All right, listen up.

19:39.036 --> 19:41.103
We got downed lines, victim in the car.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.216
Lines are live, so the whole
area could be electrified.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.184
With that voltage, even our
rubber boots won't keep us safe.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.552
There could be currents
sparking through the air.

19:46.576 --> 19:49.378
So we keep our distance till the
utility company turns the power off.

19:49.413 --> 19:51.681
- Miller, let's remove these live wires.
- Got it.

19:51.715 --> 19:53.115
Montgomery, Hughes, Warren,

19:53.150 --> 19:55.551
get ready for rapid extrication
once it's safe.

20:04.054 --> 20:06.562
Got about a 20-foot radius
of electrified pavement.

20:06.587 --> 20:08.269
Everybody be careful.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.295
All right, Warren,
let's get that patient talking,

20:10.329 --> 20:12.397
but make sure he stays
inside the vehicle.

20:12.431 --> 20:13.475
If the ground's electrified

20:13.499 --> 20:15.500
and he steps one foot
out in front of the other...

20:15.534 --> 20:16.668
Classic steak combo.

20:18.270 --> 20:19.804
He's a Sizzler.

20:19.838 --> 20:21.506
Inside, good. Outside, bad.

20:21.540 --> 20:22.701
Got it.

20:24.343 --> 20:27.178
Hey! Hey!

20:27.212 --> 20:29.981
- What's your name?
- Mar... Marshall.

20:30.015 --> 20:32.417
Marshall, okay. Okay.

20:32.451 --> 20:34.585
How you feeling?

20:34.620 --> 20:36.721
Any, Any dizziness or bleeding?

20:36.755 --> 20:38.589
None of that.
I just want to get out of here.

20:38.624 --> 20:41.492
Yeah, yeah. I'm Ben, okay?

20:41.527 --> 20:43.561
And we're gonna get you out safely,

20:43.595 --> 20:46.998
but, I need you to stay
where you are for now.

20:47.032 --> 20:49.567
Please, just stay inside the car.

20:49.601 --> 20:51.102
Can't I just make a run for it?

20:51.136 --> 20:52.437
I'm fast and lucky.

20:52.471 --> 20:54.572
I win every raffle I enter.
Like, every one.

20:54.606 --> 20:56.117
Yeah, we can't take that chance, okay?

20:56.141 --> 20:57.608
And I'm sure it sounds strange,

20:57.643 --> 20:59.277
but right now, your car's rubber tires

20:59.311 --> 21:01.579
are the only thing preventing
you from getting shocked.

21:01.613 --> 21:05.516
So, please, no matter what,
stay in there.

21:09.321 --> 21:10.355
Maya?

21:10.389 --> 21:11.522
Still running.

21:11.557 --> 21:12.757
Big Boss.

21:12.791 --> 21:14.359
- What?
- Big Boss, Big Boss.

21:14.393 --> 21:16.427
No, for real, things are happening.

21:16.462 --> 21:17.683
Who's who?

21:17.718 --> 21:19.530
Are those our guys or the bad guys?

21:19.565 --> 21:21.199
I wish the cops had their badges on.

21:21.233 --> 21:22.610
I think that's frowned upon
when you're undercover.

21:22.634 --> 21:24.535
It's hard to see much.

21:24.570 --> 21:26.204
What's that guy doing?

21:26.238 --> 21:27.472
I wish we had audio.

21:27.506 --> 21:28.606
I wish we had snacks.

21:34.847 --> 21:37.115
Hey, guys. Guys.

21:37.149 --> 21:38.383
Yeah?

21:41.086 --> 21:42.019
That car's leaking gas.

21:42.054 --> 21:44.155
If the sparks from one
of those wires hits it,

21:44.189 --> 21:46.090
the car will explode.
With Marshall inside.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.669
No, we got to get in there
and get him out.

21:47.693 --> 21:48.726
No, no, no, no, no.

21:48.761 --> 21:50.605
You touch that car,
you're gonna get electrocuted,

21:50.629 --> 21:52.163
and if that gas ignites, you'll burn.

21:52.197 --> 21:53.564
Yeah, so will he.

21:57.202 --> 21:59.504
Okay, okay. New plan.

21:59.538 --> 22:02.607
Hughes, try to sand that gas
without getting shocked.

22:02.641 --> 22:04.142
- Montgomery!
- Yeah?

22:04.176 --> 22:05.276
Tag me out.

22:06.779 --> 22:08.930
All right.

22:08.964 --> 22:10.314
- You got it?
- Yeah.

22:14.319 --> 22:17.622
Marshall, I need you
to listen very closely.

22:17.656 --> 22:19.534
I'm gonna need you to get
out of the car yourself

22:19.558 --> 22:20.992
in a very specific way.

22:21.026 --> 22:22.794
- Whoa, whoa. Get out of the car?
- Yes.

22:22.828 --> 22:24.362
That is the total opposite

22:24.396 --> 22:26.597
of what you guys just told me before.

22:26.632 --> 22:28.616
The situation has changed. We
don't have the time we thought.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.275
Now, I'm gonna need you to listen closely

22:31.309 --> 22:32.376
to my friend Jack.

22:32.411 --> 22:33.678
Hi, Jack.

22:33.712 --> 22:34.945
Hi.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.448
I need you to open the door. Can
you do that for me, Marshall?

22:37.482 --> 22:39.684
I can, but I don't want to.

22:39.718 --> 22:40.918
Okay, look at me.

22:40.952 --> 22:42.753
It's okay to open the door.

22:42.788 --> 22:44.255
You just go slow. All right?

22:44.289 --> 22:46.257
But don't get out of the car yet.

22:46.291 --> 22:48.459
- Easy.
- Easy?

22:48.493 --> 22:49.527
Yeah.

23:08.447 --> 23:10.114
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

23:10.148 --> 23:11.716
Okay, good, good.

23:11.750 --> 23:12.950
Look at that. One step closer.

23:12.984 --> 23:13.784
Good.

23:13.819 --> 23:16.087
Now stand on the frame of the car.

23:16.121 --> 23:18.289
Keep your arms to your sides like this.

23:18.323 --> 23:19.457
And absolutely do not...

23:19.491 --> 23:22.560
do not touch the ground
and the car at the same time.

23:22.594 --> 23:23.627
W-W-W-Why? Why not?

23:23.662 --> 23:24.962
'Cause that would be bad.

23:24.996 --> 23:26.564
You mean, like, electric-chair bad?

23:26.598 --> 23:28.466
Let's... Let's not think
about that right now.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.668
Okay.

23:30.702 --> 23:31.769
What's next?

23:31.803 --> 23:33.904
All right, you're gonna want
to hop onto the ground.

23:33.939 --> 23:36.507
Make sure both feet hit
the ground at the same time.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.276
You're gonna hop off like a bunny.

23:39.311 --> 23:40.444
A bunny?

23:40.479 --> 23:42.747
That way, you won't
break the circuit, all right,

23:42.781 --> 23:44.982
and all the electricity
will flow through your body

23:45.016 --> 23:46.016
and back into the ground.

23:47.486 --> 23:50.988
Like a bunny. I-I can't.

23:51.022 --> 23:52.790
- Yes, you can.
- You can do this.

23:52.824 --> 23:55.659
- I know you can.
- I don't.

23:55.694 --> 23:58.996
Okay, have... have you ever
seen birds on power lines?

23:59.030 --> 24:01.298
Birds love power lines, you know?

24:01.333 --> 24:02.700
They... They just go up there,

24:02.734 --> 24:04.335
and they just... they just chill, right?

24:04.369 --> 24:06.103
Two feet at a time.

24:06.138 --> 24:07.438
All right? They're fine.

24:07.472 --> 24:08.839
They don't get fried.

24:08.874 --> 24:11.876
So you are gonna do this
like a bird, Marshall.

24:11.910 --> 24:12.977
I thought I was a bunny.

24:13.011 --> 24:15.112
Okay, okay, now, look,
you just keep on doing that.

24:15.147 --> 24:16.480
Keep on cracking your jokes.

24:16.515 --> 24:17.959
I bet you're probably a pretty funny guy

24:17.983 --> 24:19.460
and you're probably
trying not to think about

24:19.484 --> 24:20.862
what's happening here, but, Marshall?

24:20.886 --> 24:21.786
Yeah?

24:21.820 --> 24:23.187
It's okay to be worried,

24:23.221 --> 24:25.790
'cause that keeps you alert, focused.

24:25.824 --> 24:27.291
I need you to use that right now

24:27.325 --> 24:30.861
so we can get you through this, okay?

24:30.896 --> 24:32.196
You with me?

24:34.499 --> 24:35.900
I think so.

24:35.934 --> 24:36.767
Okay.

24:36.802 --> 24:37.912
We're gonna count together, all right?

24:37.936 --> 24:40.805
You and me, all right?
Then it's boots on the ground.

24:40.839 --> 24:42.807
Two feet leave the car and hit the ground

24:42.841 --> 24:44.208
at the exact same time, okay?

24:44.242 --> 24:45.876
- On three.
- Wait, wait.

24:45.911 --> 24:48.345
Jump on three or after three?

24:48.380 --> 24:51.782
On three, Marshall. Okay?

24:53.385 --> 24:56.387
One... two...

24:56.421 --> 24:57.922
- three!
- Three!

24:57.956 --> 24:58.756
- Nice!
- Yes!

24:58.790 --> 25:00.057
That's it. Nice.

25:00.091 --> 25:01.392
- Okay.
- Very good.

25:04.095 --> 25:06.047
They're moving. Why are they moving
offscreen? Where are they going?

25:06.071 --> 25:07.175
No, no. Come back, come back,
come back, come back.

25:07.199 --> 25:08.280
I don't... I don't like this.

25:08.304 --> 25:09.834
Move in. All forces move.

25:09.868 --> 25:11.335
Use of lethal force is authorized.

25:11.369 --> 25:13.771
Wh-What the hell?

25:13.805 --> 25:15.206
What the hell?

25:15.240 --> 25:17.374
So, that's it, right? I'm safe!

25:17.409 --> 25:18.242
- No!
- N-No, no, no.

25:18.276 --> 25:19.554
You need to keep bunny-hopping to me.

25:19.578 --> 25:23.214
The street's still electrically
charged for another few feet.

25:23.248 --> 25:26.584
- Keep on hopping.
- Marshall, count of three, okay?

25:26.618 --> 25:27.952
You got this.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.920
One...

25:29.955 --> 25:31.889
two...

25:31.923 --> 25:33.057
- three.
- Three.

25:33.091 --> 25:34.291
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

25:34.326 --> 25:35.326
Good.

25:36.895 --> 25:37.895
What, are you 80?

25:37.929 --> 25:39.597
Banging stuff doesn't fix it.

25:39.631 --> 25:41.031
Come on. Come on.

25:41.066 --> 25:43.133
Ryan's in there now.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.235
Three.

25:44.269 --> 25:46.470
- Good. Yes.
- Okay, okay.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.449
You're almost there, Marshall.
Just a few more jumps.

25:48.473 --> 25:49.913
- I'm gonna make it.
- Yeah, you are.

25:49.941 --> 25:51.118
I'm gonna hug you when I get over there.

25:51.142 --> 25:52.743
Come on. Bring it.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.418
- No!
- Marshall!

26:01.453 --> 26:04.154
- Marshall!
- No! No! No, you can't.

26:04.189 --> 26:06.056
Not till the power's off.

26:10.095 --> 26:11.729
What was that?

26:11.763 --> 26:13.397
Those were gunshots.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.239
What are you doing?

26:19.264 --> 26:21.037
Gunshots mean injuries.
People are hurt in there.

26:21.061 --> 26:22.260
We can't just barrel into

26:22.285 --> 26:23.229
an active crime scene.

26:23.254 --> 26:25.689
Ryan said we have to wait
until they give us the word.

26:25.723 --> 26:27.501
- What if their radios are down?
- Andy, stop!

26:27.525 --> 26:29.827
We don't know what's going on in there.

26:29.861 --> 26:31.696
We need to wait.

26:35.567 --> 26:37.034
We have to wait.

26:37.069 --> 26:39.203
We can't wait any more, Jack.

26:39.237 --> 26:41.149
Do you know what a jolt like
that does to the human heart?

26:41.173 --> 26:41.973
Time is muscle.

26:42.007 --> 26:44.275
Back off, Warren. That's an order.

26:44.309 --> 26:46.277
Hughes, talk to me about that power.

26:46.311 --> 26:48.212
Any minute. No, we need it now.

26:48.246 --> 26:50.715
- I'm going in.
- Hey, don't go there, man.

26:50.749 --> 26:52.683
His body could still be
conducting electricity.

26:52.718 --> 26:53.958
You want to end up next to him?

27:01.493 --> 27:02.727
Power's off! We're clear!

27:02.761 --> 27:04.128
All right, go, go go.

27:04.162 --> 27:05.830
Warren, Montgomery, assess the patient.

27:05.864 --> 27:07.798
Hughes, Miller,
get that gasoline cleaned up

27:07.833 --> 27:09.867
and off the street
while I secure these lines.

27:09.901 --> 27:11.235
Move it!

27:11.269 --> 27:12.036
Okay, on my count.

27:12.070 --> 27:14.372
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

27:15.173 --> 27:17.742
Labored breathing, weak pulse.

27:17.776 --> 27:19.643
Cap refill is delayed.

27:21.613 --> 27:23.481
He's in V-fib.

27:23.515 --> 27:24.612
Charging.

27:26.952 --> 27:28.386
Come on. This thing takes forever.

27:29.221 --> 27:31.489
And clear!

27:31.523 --> 27:33.491
Shock delivered.

27:33.525 --> 27:34.725
Still in V-fib.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.093
Charging again.

27:36.128 --> 27:38.029
Come on, Marshall. Stay with me, Buddy.

27:38.063 --> 27:39.830
Earthquake insurance.

27:39.865 --> 27:42.333
We're just earthquake insurance.

27:42.367 --> 27:44.502
PD pays us to sit here and not be needed,

27:44.536 --> 27:45.836
and now an earthquake hit.

27:45.871 --> 27:47.071
Someone is in there, shot,

27:47.105 --> 27:49.237
possibly bleeding out while we sit here.

27:49.238 --> 27:50.482
And the human body holds
eight pints of blood.

27:50.506 --> 27:51.372
One good hit to an artery,

27:51.407 --> 27:52.451
and all that can pour out in minutes.

27:52.475 --> 27:54.442
How many minutes has it been?
Two? Maybe three?

27:54.477 --> 27:56.421
If we get in there
and they've lost all that blood,

27:56.445 --> 27:58.413
we'll have to get pressure up,
pack the wound,

27:58.447 --> 27:59.614
keep an eye on that pulse.

27:59.648 --> 28:01.916
It goes thready, we'll be ready
with epi and I.V. fluids.

28:01.951 --> 28:03.785
We'll be ready. We are ready.

28:03.819 --> 28:06.588
Andy, it's not Ryan.

28:06.622 --> 28:08.423
It's not going to be Ryan.

28:08.457 --> 28:10.258
Call us, damn it!

28:10.292 --> 28:11.837
Come on, Marshall.
You got this. You got this.

28:11.861 --> 28:13.328
And clear.

28:13.362 --> 28:15.530
Shock delivered.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.601
Yes! Normal sinus rhythm.

28:22.138 --> 28:24.105
- Ben.
- Yeah, I'm here.

28:24.140 --> 28:25.473
You gave us a scare.

28:25.508 --> 28:28.309
Guess I didn't stick that last landing.

28:28.344 --> 28:29.677
BP's dropping.

28:33.616 --> 28:35.950
- What's wrong?
- Hey.

28:35.985 --> 28:38.620
Electrical burns can look minor
from the outside,

28:38.654 --> 28:39.621
but given the voltage?

28:39.655 --> 28:40.722
His insides are a mess.

28:40.756 --> 28:42.534
His abdomen's getting rigid.
He's bleeding internally.

28:42.558 --> 28:43.925
He needs a laparotomy right away.

28:43.959 --> 28:45.727
He's not stable enough to move yet.

28:48.330 --> 28:51.199
I'm not feeling so great.

28:51.233 --> 28:54.669
A little tingling everywhere,

28:54.703 --> 28:57.472
and I can't... I can't move my arms.

28:57.506 --> 28:59.808
He's going into shock. I.V. fluids now.

29:00.743 --> 29:02.110
Aid Car, move in.

29:02.144 --> 29:03.645
Repeat... Aid Car, move in.

29:03.679 --> 29:04.979
- Finally.
- All right, let's go.

29:10.586 --> 29:11.619
Follow me.

29:11.654 --> 29:13.165
Is it an officer down
or one of the other guys?

29:13.189 --> 29:14.455
It's an officer.

29:14.490 --> 29:15.890
I'm sure it's not him.

29:15.925 --> 29:18.526
Give it to me straight. Am I dying?

29:18.561 --> 29:20.305
No, we're just trying
to stabilize your vitals

29:20.329 --> 29:22.007
so it's safe to move you
to that ambulance over there

29:22.031 --> 29:24.075
so we can get you to the hospital
as soon as we can, okay?

29:24.099 --> 29:26.868
You don't want to say it.
I get that, but...

29:26.902 --> 29:30.705
if I'm not gonna make it, let me...

29:30.739 --> 29:32.640
call my wife.

29:32.675 --> 29:34.409
Phone's in that pocket.

29:34.443 --> 29:37.078
I just...

29:37.112 --> 29:38.646
I want to talk to her.

29:38.681 --> 29:40.415
No. We are not there yet.

29:40.449 --> 29:41.683
You hear me, Marshall?

29:43.786 --> 29:44.819
Marshall.

29:45.955 --> 29:47.689
Dopamine... now.

30:05.608 --> 30:07.275
He's right over here.

30:16.619 --> 30:18.786
He was wearing his vest,
but the blast was point-blank.

30:18.821 --> 30:20.521
It burns.

30:20.556 --> 30:21.856
We got you.

30:21.891 --> 30:23.358
The vest stopped the bullet.

30:24.727 --> 30:26.728
- Losing his pulse.
- BP is still dropping.

30:26.762 --> 30:27.806
His organs are shutting down.

30:27.830 --> 30:29.564
Pushing another round of dopamine.

30:29.598 --> 30:33.701
Marshall.

30:47.116 --> 30:48.316
We need to intubate now.

30:50.286 --> 30:51.598
- Hang on.
- Why?

30:51.633 --> 30:53.633
'Cause once we intubate,
he won't be able to speak.

31:01.764 --> 31:02.764
Marshall, um...

31:07.469 --> 31:08.736
let's call your wife.

31:16.712 --> 31:17.890
Sorry to wake you,

31:17.925 --> 31:21.082
but I didn't want anyone
to worry about you.

31:21.116 --> 31:24.953
That's my husband, always waking me up.

31:28.123 --> 31:29.657
Hey, hon.

31:32.496 --> 31:34.236
So, I had the best day.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.342
I got the car seats
buy two, get one free.

31:36.367 --> 31:38.534
I am a coupon master.

31:38.569 --> 31:41.003
Then I had them installed
at the fire station

31:41.038 --> 31:42.672
by these amazing firefighters.

31:42.706 --> 31:44.374
Didn't even have to lift a finger.

31:44.408 --> 31:47.410
They... They are lifesavers.

31:47.444 --> 31:48.544
Yeah, they are.

31:48.579 --> 31:49.912
They've been so great.

31:49.947 --> 31:52.181
They let me beach myself here.

31:52.216 --> 31:54.384
I don't know who made their couch,

31:54.418 --> 31:57.487
but we are getting one immediately.

31:57.521 --> 31:58.721
Then...

31:58.756 --> 32:01.945
Lynn, honey, I just wanted to say...

32:03.293 --> 32:05.615
I love our kids so much.

32:06.597 --> 32:08.364
And I haven't even met them yet.

32:08.399 --> 32:10.666
I know, hon. Me, too.

32:10.701 --> 32:12.368
It's crazy, right?

32:12.403 --> 32:14.337
I love you, too.

32:14.371 --> 32:15.671
Aww, sweetie.

32:16.585 --> 32:18.574
I know what you're doing.

32:18.609 --> 32:20.576
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you're trying to butter me up

32:20.611 --> 32:22.845
into letting your mom
into the delivery room

32:22.880 --> 32:24.080
when we've been over this.

32:24.114 --> 32:27.450
I didn't come out of her vagina.
I don't need her seeing mine.

32:27.484 --> 32:30.086
No, I need you to hear me.

32:30.120 --> 32:33.589
I love you so much.

32:34.918 --> 32:36.719
- Okay.
- Say it back.

32:37.928 --> 32:40.596
Is... everything all right?

32:40.631 --> 32:42.360
Please, Lynn.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.568
I love you.

32:45.602 --> 32:47.103
I love you, too.

32:52.676 --> 32:53.943
Everything all right?

32:55.345 --> 32:56.446
I can't tell.

33:00.584 --> 33:02.485
I don't think so.

33:39.556 --> 33:40.623
He's gonna be okay, right?

33:40.657 --> 33:43.593
He's alert and responsive.
He's got strong vitals.

33:43.627 --> 33:45.294
He needs a chest X-ray just to be safe.

33:45.329 --> 33:47.173
You mind giving us a few minutes
before carting him off?

33:47.197 --> 33:49.342
I need to get a statement and
a positive I.D. on the shooter.

33:49.366 --> 33:50.666
Not too long.

33:51.568 --> 33:53.302
Thank you guys for being here today.

33:53.337 --> 33:54.647
We wanted to get you in there sooner,

33:54.671 --> 33:55.872
but the scene wasn't secure.

33:55.906 --> 33:58.007
Yeah, once we heard that shot,

33:58.041 --> 34:00.409
it was hard to not just bolt in.

34:03.547 --> 34:05.882
You weren't worried it was me, were you?

34:05.916 --> 34:07.517
I was happy it wasn't.

34:09.485 --> 34:12.688
We both were.

34:12.723 --> 34:14.443
Put your friend in the back
when he's ready.

34:15.692 --> 34:18.360
Nice raiding with you.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.568
Ryan's been helping me out recently.

34:25.601 --> 34:27.203
With?

34:27.237 --> 34:28.737
My brother.

34:30.274 --> 34:31.641
He found him pretty messed up.

34:31.675 --> 34:33.186
I guess he's been living on the streets.

34:33.210 --> 34:35.545
I can coach anybody. I'm a fixer.

34:35.579 --> 34:38.147
I can fix anything but not this.

34:38.181 --> 34:39.215
I don't know what to do.

34:39.248 --> 34:42.585
I can't believe you let me go on
and on about a guy

34:42.619 --> 34:44.063
when this is what's been
going on with you.

34:44.087 --> 34:46.188
I-I'm so sorry you felt
like you couldn't tell me.

34:46.223 --> 34:47.556
- It's not you.
- No, it is me.

34:47.591 --> 34:48.902
You're right.
It... It's been all about me.

34:48.926 --> 34:52.328
I just didn't want to say it out loud.

34:52.362 --> 34:56.264
What are you... What are you gonna do?

34:58.302 --> 35:00.169
I have no idea.

35:02.673 --> 35:05.741
You know, when I asked before if...

35:05.776 --> 35:08.757
if we'd be friends
if we didn't work together,

35:09.746 --> 35:13.182
the answer is yes.

35:13.216 --> 35:16.852
In any universe,
it'd still be you and me.

35:19.289 --> 35:21.023
Copy that.

35:23.827 --> 35:25.428
Ryan found him for you?

35:25.462 --> 35:28.965
Yeah. Ryan's kind of great.

35:28.999 --> 35:31.233
Yeah. He is.

35:31.268 --> 35:33.469
What are you gonna do?

35:33.503 --> 35:37.907
If you and Jack are over, you're
free and clear to move on.

35:46.316 --> 35:47.683
Tough call today.

35:48.986 --> 35:50.620
I've lost patients before.

35:50.654 --> 35:52.189
Yeah, it feels different, though,

35:52.223 --> 35:55.157
when you lose them
right there in the moment

35:55.192 --> 35:57.760
and you think about
who they're leaving behind.

36:14.177 --> 36:15.645
Is he okay?

36:15.679 --> 36:17.079
It's never easy losing somebody.

36:17.114 --> 36:19.115
He's dealing with a lot right now.

36:21.184 --> 36:23.586
Okay, when you have something to spill

36:23.620 --> 36:26.455
and you choose not to spill,
you make angels cry.

36:27.791 --> 36:29.058
It's not the time.

36:31.795 --> 36:33.095
- It's not the time.
- Mnh-mnh.

36:34.865 --> 36:37.133
Okay, fine. Jack and Andy
have been hooking up.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.267
- What?
- Wait. What?

36:38.301 --> 36:39.702
- Wha...
- W-Wait. For how long?

36:39.736 --> 36:42.838
Why would they do that? I-I don't know.

36:42.873 --> 36:45.875
I-I don't know how I feel about this.

36:45.909 --> 36:47.510
N...

36:47.544 --> 36:49.779
I mean, not good, I think, is how I feel.

36:49.813 --> 36:51.981
- Hoo-hoo-hoo.
- Jack and Andy?

36:52.015 --> 36:53.783
Okay, that's unsettling. I am unsettled.

36:53.817 --> 36:55.317
No wonder Pruitt was pissed.

36:55.352 --> 36:56.519
I wonder how it started.

36:56.553 --> 36:58.491
I wonder where it started.

36:59.222 --> 37:01.991
Ew. Do you... Do you think
they did it in here?

37:02.025 --> 37:05.828
You know, Jack's my guy, and
he hasn't said one word to me.

37:05.862 --> 37:07.496
Not one word?

37:07.531 --> 37:09.065
No, we are a team built on trust,

37:09.099 --> 37:10.833
and they have been lying to us.

37:10.867 --> 37:12.902
You know, if we can't trust each other,

37:12.936 --> 37:14.937
this whole place falls apart.

37:24.881 --> 37:26.315
Heard you had quite the day.

37:26.349 --> 37:28.551
I did.

37:28.585 --> 37:30.815
I heard you did, too.

37:31.855 --> 37:33.155
Yeah.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.828
I guess we should go tell everyone.

37:38.862 --> 37:40.529
I guess we should.

37:40.564 --> 37:42.031
It may not go well.

37:42.065 --> 37:46.135
They could be really angry and hurt.

37:47.571 --> 37:48.738
Yeah.

38:00.417 --> 38:03.853
Jack and I wanted to talk
to you all because,

38:03.887 --> 38:07.723
for the past few months,
we've been seeing each other.

38:09.659 --> 38:12.128
We know it was unprofessional

38:12.162 --> 38:13.929
not to be honest with you,

38:13.964 --> 38:15.898
but we never meant to disrespect anyone.

38:15.932 --> 38:16.932
O-Okay, wait, wait.

38:16.967 --> 38:22.238
O-O-Okay, um, I mean,
that's unexpected, right?

38:22.272 --> 38:23.615
No? N-Nobody?

38:23.649 --> 38:27.109
If anyone has any questions,
we're here to answer them.

38:27.144 --> 38:28.811
I'm cool with it.

38:28.845 --> 38:32.581
Y'all can do...

38:32.616 --> 38:34.784
who... what... I'm good.

38:34.818 --> 38:36.952
Okay, first, is this why you two

38:36.987 --> 38:38.498
spent so much time in the turnout room?

38:38.522 --> 38:40.066
Second, did you do it
in the turnout room?

38:40.090 --> 38:41.457
Okay.

38:41.491 --> 38:43.092
Third, did you do it
on or near my gear

38:43.126 --> 38:44.226
in the turnout room?

38:44.261 --> 38:47.963
And fourth, who would you
save first in a fire?

38:47.998 --> 38:49.632
Me or one of you?

38:52.002 --> 38:53.569
I don't really care what you do.

38:53.603 --> 38:55.971
It's your business.

38:56.006 --> 38:59.508
But one of you will be captain here soon.

38:59.543 --> 39:02.444
You have to see how that
might make some question

39:02.479 --> 39:04.680
whether you can really be unbiased.

39:04.714 --> 39:09.451
So I guess my question is,
is one of you gonna leave?

39:13.290 --> 39:16.025
No, because we broke up.

39:16.059 --> 39:18.160
The worst thing about getting shocked

39:18.195 --> 39:19.595
is you don't see it coming.

39:19.629 --> 39:21.293
Thanks for listening.

39:21.327 --> 39:22.965
We just thought you should know.

39:33.844 --> 39:34.844
Hey.

39:34.878 --> 39:36.478
It jolts you.

39:36.513 --> 39:37.513
Was there more?

39:39.015 --> 39:42.618
Um, I got us a table at
the jazz club in Belltown.

39:42.652 --> 39:45.054
I wore my good jeans,

39:45.088 --> 39:49.024
and I was gonna bust out all the stops.

39:49.059 --> 39:49.959
I would hope so.

39:49.993 --> 39:51.694
Yeah, it takes a minute
to look this good.

39:52.762 --> 39:54.797
It grabs you.

39:54.831 --> 39:57.733
I had a weird day.

39:57.767 --> 40:00.736
And I just found out some stuff at work

40:00.770 --> 40:04.139
about people that I-I thought
I knew really well.

40:04.174 --> 40:05.975
And you came to me to talk about Seth,

40:06.009 --> 40:07.810
and I don't want to bring him up

40:07.844 --> 40:09.712
if it's too sad or disrespectful,

40:09.746 --> 40:13.082
but I-I haven't always done
a lot of that.

40:13.116 --> 40:14.255
Talking.

40:14.297 --> 40:16.085
I mean, at least not
about important stuff,

40:16.119 --> 40:21.891
and I-I-I just wanted to talk
because I like talking to you,

40:21.925 --> 40:23.659
because I-I like you.

40:23.693 --> 40:25.327
And, I don't... I don't know.

40:25.362 --> 40:27.096
I don't know what I'm saying,

40:27.130 --> 40:31.066
and I should just shut up
or... or go or... or both.

40:31.101 --> 40:34.603
Or you're just staring at me,
and, um... okay.

40:34.638 --> 40:35.938
I'm sorry.

40:35.972 --> 40:38.173
I should... I should... I should go.

40:38.208 --> 40:39.775
It's electric.

40:49.586 --> 40:52.721
But when the shock's gone...

40:52.756 --> 40:55.057
you have to deal with the aftermath.

40:56.960 --> 41:01.096
Any interesting calls after I left?

41:01.131 --> 41:04.366
What? I know how important
this is to you.

41:04.401 --> 41:08.470
And while hearing about all
the fire and danger and stuff

41:08.505 --> 41:11.140
isn't ever gonna be my favorite,

41:11.174 --> 41:13.976
I don't want you to think
you can't share it with me.

41:14.010 --> 41:15.978
Because a jolt like that...

41:16.012 --> 41:19.148
That, That means a lot.

41:19.182 --> 41:20.549
It'll hurt.

41:20.583 --> 41:23.118
So, come on. Hit me up.

41:23.153 --> 41:26.322
Don't you want to tell me
all about how you got all sweaty

41:26.356 --> 41:28.691
lifting the Jaws of Life or something?

41:30.093 --> 41:33.162
The calls aren't always that exciting.

41:33.196 --> 41:34.630
So nothing big today?

41:37.200 --> 41:38.634
Nothing big.

41:47.277 --> 41:48.277
It can burn you.

41:50.647 --> 41:53.015
But it can also shake you
out of your comfort zone...

41:56.853 --> 41:57.987
zap you awake...

42:00.190 --> 42:01.790
force you to do something big...

42:05.427 --> 42:06.795
and see where the sparks fall.

42:07.305 --> 42:13.541
