WEBVTT

02:09.755 --> 02:12.089
- You swear it?
- By the mother.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.552
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.228
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.731
Your son can go on
calling himself King in the North.

02:28.816 --> 02:32.235
The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,

02:32.319 --> 02:34.195
provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.363
And the wording of this oath?

02:35.447 --> 02:38.074
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.871
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.254
And in return for my son's loyalty?

02:51.630 --> 02:54.757
In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.092
When that's done,

02:56.844 --> 03:00.555
Baratheon and Stark will fight
their common enemy together,

03:00.639 --> 03:02.306
as they have done many times before.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.649
Our two houses have always been close,

03:12.109 --> 03:16.028
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.530
Negotiate a peace with your brother.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.782
Negotiate with Stannis?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.076
You heard him out there.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.037
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.958
Please bring my terms to your son.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.919
I believe we are natural allies.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.337
I hope he feels the same.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.382
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.231
No!

03:56.403 --> 03:57.486
No.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.863
Follow me!

04:01.992 --> 04:05.244
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

04:49.206 --> 04:50.206
We've got to leave.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.669
They'll hang you for this.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.463
Now.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.675
I won't leave him.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.929
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.349
Over there, go!

05:08.433 --> 05:10.142
Not that way.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.762
We need to go home.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.849
- Loras.
- My lord, my lady.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.434
Get out.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.602
Stannis will be here in an hour.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.105
When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.691
Your former companions
will fight for the privilege

05:58.775 --> 06:01.193
of selling you to their new king.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.945
And you want that privilege for yourself.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.656
You will note that I am standing here
talking to you,

06:06.408 --> 06:07.533
not Stannis.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.868
There's no time for this.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.536
Ride back to Highgarden, sister.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.246
I'm not running from Stannis.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.789
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.915
I don't believe that.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.626
You don't believe that.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.297
Who gained the most from our king's death?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.049
Stannis.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.051
I will put a sword through his righteous face.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.886
You can't stay here.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.972
He would have been a true king,

06:30.849 --> 06:32.725
a good king.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.143
Tell me, Ser Loras,

06:35.145 --> 06:36.771
what do you desire most in this world?

06:37.689 --> 06:38.939
Revenge.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.484
I have always found that
to be the purest of motivations,

06:42.360 --> 06:44.904
but you won't have a chance
to put your sword through Stannis,

06:44.988 --> 06:46.739
not today.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.824
You'll be cut to pieces
before he sets foot on solid ground.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.536
If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.164
You can't avenge him from the grave.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.918
Bring the horses.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.880
Please.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.036
He was very handsome.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.746
He was, Your Grace.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.915
"Your Grace."

07:40.043 --> 07:42.169
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

07:42.254 --> 07:45.297
And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.634
Do you want to be a queen?

07:48.718 --> 07:49.927
No.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.557
I want to be the queen.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.654
Killed? By whom?

08:08.738 --> 08:10.156
Accounts differ.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.992
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark
in some way.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.743
Really? Who'd have thought?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.163
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

08:17.247 --> 08:19.832
while still others say
it was Stannis himself who did it

08:19.916 --> 08:22.084
after negotiations went sour.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.003
Whomever did it, I say well done.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.421
It's not what Varys says.

08:25.589 --> 08:28.132
He says Renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,

08:28.633 --> 08:31.844
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.263
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.390
And I say Father raised you
to have too much respect for money.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.145
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.438
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.940
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.108
She'll be safer in Dorne.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.194
Yes, I know how concerned you are
for her safety.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.070
It so happens that I am.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.449
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all for you.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.118
So clever.

08:57.245 --> 09:01.081
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.959
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.212
They are going to attack us.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.755
We need to be ready.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.090
No need to concern yourself over it.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.886
The king is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.181
May I ask specifically
what the king has in mind?

09:17.265 --> 09:19.683
You may, specifically,
or you may ask vaguely.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.810
The answer will be the same.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.818
It's important that we talk about this.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.616
It's the king's royal prerogative

09:35.700 --> 09:39.245
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.005
It's wildfire.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.590
Wildfire?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.678
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.597
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.808
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?

10:02.185 --> 10:03.602
Tell me,

10:03.687 --> 10:07.356
if the vile allegations
against my brother and sister are true,

10:08.024 --> 10:11.110
do you think it will make Jaime
more likely to kill you or less likely?

10:12.529 --> 10:15.072
When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.782
I'm telling you the truth.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.325
The smart money would be on more likely.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.618
She's making wildfire.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.496
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges
will give him sympathy for yours.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.164
The Alchemists' Guild
is being commissioned.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.666
I suppose there's only one way to find out.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.502
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.462
They are planning to launch it
from the city walls

10:30.547 --> 10:32.339
into Stannis' ships and armies.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.174
Please.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.720
When did she tell you this?

10:39.264 --> 10:41.432
I heard her talking with the pyromancer.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.937
And the other night, after I left her,
she went to meet him.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.023
I swear to you.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.524
Swear to me on what?

10:50.734 --> 10:51.775
On my life.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.319
But I don't care about your life.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.323
In the light of the Seven,
by all that is holy and right,

10:57.407 --> 10:59.867
I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...

10:59.951 --> 11:03.620
All right, all right. Enough.
Even torturing you is boring.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.456
Just get out.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.003
Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn

11:11.087 --> 11:13.881
to please kill you
if anything should happen to me.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.925
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.138
It will be my pleasure.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.186
Your Grace.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.937
What is it?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.231
I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.859
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.028
Fools love a fool.

11:36.112 --> 11:40.074
I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was,
not the man he grew to be.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.450
I need to speak to you

11:41.534 --> 11:43.535
- about what I saw in that cave.
- I thought I made it clear to you

11:43.620 --> 11:44.953
there'd be no need to speak to me
on this matter.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.038
Your Grace, l...

11:46.122 --> 11:48.457
I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.127
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.629
You've come to lecture me on truth?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.047
I've come to tell you that what I saw...

11:55.131 --> 11:57.299
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.471
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.515
They won't be able to resist us now.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.225
Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.727
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the Iron...

12:08.812 --> 12:10.437
I'll hear no more about it.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.864
Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.909
When do we sail for King's Landing?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.245
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.205
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.499
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

12:30.583 --> 12:33.752
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.880
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.175
That's not your concern.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.804
If you take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.140
I never thought I'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.851
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.186
Oh, truth again.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.689
All right, what's the truth?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.567
The hard truth?

12:56.651 --> 13:00.446
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.575
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.371
What do you believe?

13:13.168 --> 13:15.919
You won those bannermen from Renly.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.547
Don't lose them to her.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.305
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.851
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.813
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

13:34.898 --> 13:37.483
was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.151
The other lords won't be happy.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.237
Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky

13:42.322 --> 13:44.573
I don't hang them for treason.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.745
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.723
I've got it! I've got it!

14:09.807 --> 14:12.059
So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.563
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

14:16.648 --> 14:20.150
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.735
What do we have?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.446
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.991
Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.452
Good thing. I'd be out of a job.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.621
What about your father?

14:33.831 --> 14:35.249
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.918
He's very busy.

14:38.002 --> 14:41.922
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.216
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

14:44.300 --> 14:45.801
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.095
- Corruption.
- Yes!

14:48.596 --> 14:52.641
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.019
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

14:56.104 --> 14:59.439
and we're surprised
when the fruit of their incest is rotten?

15:00.692 --> 15:03.485
Yes, a rotten king.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.446
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.740
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.660
The king is a lost cause.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.079
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.833
A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls

15:17.917 --> 15:21.503
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.674
You have to admire his imagination.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.676
He's talking about you.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.929
What? Demon monkey?

15:31.014 --> 15:33.348
People think you're pulling the king's strings.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.559
They blame you for the city's ills.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.936
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.272
You don't need to convince me.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.525
Demon monkey.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.765
Yeah, come on.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.224
You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.770
I'm your commander. Welcome.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.607
Stop.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.901
Stop!

16:26.569 --> 16:29.154
Your captain commands you to stop!

16:30.073 --> 16:32.282
Where are we headed, Captain?

16:33.910 --> 16:37.329
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.874
There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,
if you do yourjobs well.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.086
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.255
I do.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.424
Your captain.

16:51.594 --> 16:57.599
I have been reaving and raping
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.

16:58.768 --> 17:02.604
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.898
Don't reckon I've got much use
for a captain at all.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.986
I'm thinking I can do the job of captain
real well myself.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.239
All I need is a ship.

17:13.074 --> 17:17.118
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

17:21.332 --> 17:24.917
You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.839
And I will hunt you down, drag you back here
in chains and hang you for a traitor.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.466
Stop. We yield.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.973
Congratulations on your first command.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.684
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.977
Oh, I'm not here for you.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.397
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.

17:45.481 --> 17:49.109
I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.736
Too narrow.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.114
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.408
That would never happen.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.953
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.372
This lot, though...

18:04.250 --> 18:06.209
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.675
Come on, I'll take you out.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.761
Who are you?

18:15.845 --> 18:17.846
Dagmer, your first mate.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.266
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

18:21.350 --> 18:25.103
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

18:25.188 --> 18:26.480
That would be good for a laugh.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.608
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.861
And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.362
You're not.

18:35.031 --> 18:40.202
And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that I'm a true Iron lslander.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.996
They're all Iron lslanders.

18:43.164 --> 18:46.625
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

18:53.716 --> 18:56.843
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.262
The seat of the House of Tallhart,

19:04.227 --> 19:06.770
- What, you don't think we could take it?
- No, we could.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.939
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.316
As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

19:11.400 --> 19:14.444
the Starks would send their men
to take it back.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.279
And then...

19:23.871 --> 19:25.330
Take me to my ship.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.004
The Starks have overextended their lines.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.923
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

19:35.007 --> 19:36.842
keeping their men and horses fed.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.010
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.929
The cold won't beat them.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.725
Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.

19:45.810 --> 19:50.272
They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.108
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

19:53.192 --> 19:56.152
they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.780
This is war, no one's content.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.327
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.956
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.627
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.213
You've been waiting for him to fail.

20:15.339 --> 20:19.259
He is not going to fail, not without our help.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.848
So how do we stop him?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.766
We've worked
through the night, my lord.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.644
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.688
Yes, I think you would, Reginald.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.483
And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.112
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.031
My wife's in Lannisport.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.158
Well, then you'd better start riding.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.996
Go, before I change my mind
and send her your head.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.123
If your name wasn't Lannister,

20:50.207 --> 20:53.835
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.840
Not wine, water.

20:59.717 --> 21:00.842
We'll be here for some time.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.140
Girl.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.644
Where are you from?

21:10.853 --> 21:12.520
Maidenpool, my lord.

21:13.564 --> 21:17.067
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.945
House Mooton, my lord.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.738
And what is their sigil?

21:26.327 --> 21:28.119
A red salmon.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.872
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.042
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

21:35.544 --> 21:38.380
Good. One more time, where are you from?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.632
Barrowton, my lord.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.592
House Dustin.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.345
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

21:47.682 --> 21:50.934
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

21:53.938 --> 21:56.439
They call him the Young Wolf.

21:56.524 --> 21:57.816
And?

21:58.901 --> 22:01.194
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.534
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.577
They say he can't be killed.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.539
And do you believe them?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.583
No, my lord.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.712
Anyone can be killed.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.929
Fetch that water.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.680
A girl says nothing.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.061
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

23:17.313 --> 23:22.150
No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.448
A boy becomes a girl.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.991
I was always a girl.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.160
And I was always aware.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.954
But the girl keeps secrets.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.291
It is not for a man to spoil them.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.586
You're one of them now.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.466
I should have let you burn.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.554
And you fetch water for one of them now.

23:52.515 --> 23:55.350
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

23:56.352 --> 23:58.770
- I didn't have a choice.
- You did.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.814
I did.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.399
And here we are.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.154
A man pays his debts.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.365
A man owes three.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.825
Three what?

24:13.202 --> 24:16.204
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.

24:16.831 --> 24:19.415
And only death may pay for life.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.086
You saved me and the two I was with.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.214
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.553
We have to give them back.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.933
Speak three names

24:37.726 --> 24:39.936
and the man will do the rest.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.481
Three lives I will give you,

24:43.566 --> 24:45.275
no more, no less,

24:45.359 --> 24:46.651
and we're done.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.820
I can name anyone

24:50.030 --> 24:51.531
and you'll kill him?

24:52.575 --> 24:54.409
A man has said.

24:57.705 --> 24:58.913
The one who tortures everyone.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.748
A man needs a name.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.750
I don't know his name.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.669
They call him the Tickler.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.421
That is enough.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.633
Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.024
He's not here yet.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.735
He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.320
When will he come?

25:30.404 --> 25:33.072
The Halfhand does things in his own time.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.533
My uncle told me stories about him.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.035
Most of them are true.

25:37.119 --> 25:40.413
I heard the Halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.706
The whole winter.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.250
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.211
Had to wait for the thaw.

25:46.295 --> 25:49.964
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.259
Well, possible for the Halfhand.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.136
Beautiful, isn't it?

25:55.638 --> 25:57.722
Gilly would love it here.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.559
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.172
About time you did something.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.675
At least you'll keep warm.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.012
The Fist of the First Men.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.349
Think of how old this place is.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.560
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

26:44.645 --> 26:47.105
before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.899
Before I die, please, stop talking.

26:50.776 --> 26:55.780
Thousands and thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here where we're standing

26:55.864 --> 26:57.991
all through the long night.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.829
What do you think they were like,
the First Men?

27:02.913 --> 27:04.247
Stupid.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.417
Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.627
I think they were afraid.

27:11.672 --> 27:14.048
I think they came here
to get away from something.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.552
And I don't think it worked.

27:21.682 --> 27:22.807
Wildlings?

27:25.561 --> 27:27.812
One blast is for rangers returning.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.522
Wildlings is two blasts.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.984
So you got to stand there waiting,

27:33.569 --> 27:35.111
wondering.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.696
One blast for friends,

27:38.157 --> 27:39.657
two for foes.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.536
And three for White Walkers.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.709
It's been a thousand years,

27:49.793 --> 27:52.503
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.797
But if it's been a thousand years,
how do you know?

27:55.507 --> 27:58.468
- Well...
- I read it in a book.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.553
Look.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.265
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.143
Aye, we'll live another day.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.604
Hurrah.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.783
Take care, my lord.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.994
I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,

28:25.496 --> 28:27.997
"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."

28:28.123 --> 28:31.626
Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.170
It could well be true.

28:34.254 --> 28:39.300
The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood, stone, even steel,

28:39.551 --> 28:41.803
and, of course, flesh.

28:42.763 --> 28:47.141
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

28:50.646 --> 28:55.858
After the dragons died, wildfire was the key
to the Targaryen power.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.028
My companion takes issue.

28:59.113 --> 29:03.616
If I could tell you how many crazy old men
I've seen pushing carts around army camps

29:03.700 --> 29:06.285
making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.665
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.084
The substance is fire given form.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.504
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.630
To do what?

29:17.714 --> 29:21.384
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.011
How much do you have?

29:27.933 --> 29:31.102
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

29:31.186 --> 29:34.689
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in ten,

29:34.773 --> 29:37.859
but all the real soldiers
are in the Riverlands with your father.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.944
My lord, this man is insulting.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.155
I don't know if you've ever seen a battle,
old man,

29:42.239 --> 29:43.781
but things can get a bit messy.

29:43.866 --> 29:47.368
'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,
he's flinging them right back at us.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.413
Men die, men shit themselves, men run,

29:50.497 --> 29:52.165
which means pots falling,

29:52.249 --> 29:54.000
which means fire inside the walls,

29:54.084 --> 29:58.838
which means the poor cunts trying to defend
the city end up burning it down.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.923
My friend remains unconvinced.

30:01.008 --> 30:05.094
He would not dare insult my order
whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.

30:05.179 --> 30:07.597
Well, he's not living anymore.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.725
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

30:11.435 --> 30:14.395
Men win wars, not magic tricks.

30:30.370 --> 30:34.499
We have been working tirelessly,
day and night,

30:34.583 --> 30:39.003
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

30:39.087 --> 30:44.383
Our present count stands at 7,811.

30:44.968 --> 30:50.181
Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet
and armies both.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.225
This is a shit idea.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.521
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne.

30:57.439 --> 31:01.192
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.113
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.743
You'll be making it for me.

31:41.483 --> 31:44.318
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.157
Let him sleep, Doreah.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.076
Yes, Khaleesi.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.664
He loves you.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.671
I rewove this part of the top.

32:04.172 --> 32:07.758
And I fixed the heel on this one.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.677
Thank you, my friend.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.849
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.311
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.562
It is known.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.774
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...

32:23.859 --> 32:27.862
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to Khal Drogo.

32:28.405 --> 32:31.532
May he ride forever through the night lands.

32:34.328 --> 32:37.371
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

32:38.415 --> 32:42.251
Men like to talk about other men
when they're happy.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.261
You would look like a real princess
in Xaro's...

32:52.346 --> 32:55.056
She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.731
You should wear it, Khaleesi.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.901
You are their guest. It would be rude not to.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.925
And you must visit the night market.

33:31.051 --> 33:34.804
The Qartheen night market
is like no night market you've ever seen.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.681
It sounds wonderful.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.058
The Meereenis think they have a night market.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.352
I will take you there myself.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.604
Please excuse me for a moment.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.193
What are they doing?

33:49.569 --> 33:51.612
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.407
Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.201
They can pry out the gems,
the rest is pure gold.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.287
Very soft.
He can chop off as much as we can carry.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.707
Or melt it. Very simple.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.208
We are his guests!

34:04.292 --> 34:07.128
You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.795
Of course not, Khaleesi!

34:09.297 --> 34:11.090
We will wait until we leave.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.757
Not even when we leave.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.677
Why not?

34:14.761 --> 34:17.554
Our host saved us from the
Red Waste and you want to steal from him?

34:17.639 --> 34:20.306
I will hear no more.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.318
My brother used to say
the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do

34:31.402 --> 34:33.571
was steal things better men have built.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.072
It's not the only thing.

34:35.157 --> 34:36.866
They're quite good at killing the better men.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.452
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.411
Mother of Dragons.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.417
On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,
I welcome you.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.295
A demonstration?

34:52.549 --> 34:53.591
Take this gem.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.467
Look at it.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.512
Into its depths.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.682
So many facets.

35:02.350 --> 35:06.353
Look closely enough
and you can see yourself in them.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.149
Often more than once.

35:13.987 --> 35:17.406
Should you grow tired
of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

35:17.491 --> 35:20.618
it would be an honor
to host you at the House of the Undying.

35:21.703 --> 35:24.705
You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.840
My apologies.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.926
Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.

35:37.010 --> 35:40.137
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

35:40.222 --> 35:43.182
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.726
What is the House of the Undying?

35:45.852 --> 35:49.688
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

35:49.773 --> 35:51.148
and drink shade of the evening.

35:51.233 --> 35:55.194
It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.

35:55.278 --> 35:59.865
So soft, they actually believe
their parlor tricks are magic.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.913
You watch over her.

36:08.875 --> 36:09.917
Do I know you?

36:10.293 --> 36:11.710
I know you.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.588
Jorah Mormont of Bear lsland.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.091
Who are you?

36:17.717 --> 36:19.301
I'm no one.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.512
But she is the Mother of Dragons.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.182
She needs true protectors,
now more than ever.

36:25.892 --> 36:30.020
They shall come day and night
to see the wonder born into the world again.

36:30.105 --> 36:33.107
And when they see, they shall lust,

36:33.483 --> 36:36.944
for dragons are fire made flesh.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.446
And fire is power.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.293
It looked like Stannis.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.005
To me it just looked like...

36:59.342 --> 37:01.635
A shadow in the shape of a man.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.762
In the shape of Stannis.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.395
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.397
Will you stay there long, my lady?

37:13.481 --> 37:16.817
Only long enough
to tell Robb what I have seen.

37:17.193 --> 37:20.321
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.116
My two youngest need me.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.619
I've been away from them for far too long.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.330
I never knew my mother.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.124
I'm sorry.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.961
My own mother died on the birthing bed

37:37.047 --> 37:38.464
when I was very young.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.345
It's a bloody business.

37:44.804 --> 37:48.349
What comes after is even harder.

37:49.851 --> 37:52.937
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

37:53.521 --> 37:55.981
will you give me leave to go, my lady?

37:56.358 --> 37:58.150
You mean to kill Stannis.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.069
I swore a vow.

38:00.153 --> 38:03.447
But Stannis has a great army around him.

38:03.531 --> 38:06.158
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.534
I'm as good as any of them.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.663
I should never have fled.

38:11.247 --> 38:14.208
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.251
You served him bravely.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.546
I only held him that once

38:20.924 --> 38:22.675
as he was dying.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.137
He's gone, Brienne.

38:28.223 --> 38:31.558
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

38:32.894 --> 38:35.813
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.611
I do not know your son, my lady.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.659
But I could serve you, if you would have me.

38:49.619 --> 38:50.911
You have courage.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.833
Not battle courage, perhaps,
but, I don't know,

38:57.210 --> 38:59.420
a woman's kind of courage.

38:59.504 --> 39:03.007
And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

39:03.091 --> 39:06.593
Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.

39:12.809 --> 39:15.769
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.737
Then I am yours, my lady.

39:26.197 --> 39:30.617
I will shield your back
and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.

39:30.952 --> 39:33.912
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

39:41.379 --> 39:45.132
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

39:45.258 --> 39:46.633
and at my table

39:47.218 --> 39:51.472
and that I shall ask no service of you
that might bring you dishonor.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.309
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.148
And it's not just thieves, my lord.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.776
There's wolves in them hills now,

40:03.860 --> 40:06.028
more than I ever seen.

40:06.154 --> 40:08.989
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.910
My three sons is away
fighting for your brother, my lord.

40:13.161 --> 40:16.455
They'll fight, keep fighting
till they're told to go home.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.792
I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.420
I can't keep watch all day and all night.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.467
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

40:28.551 --> 40:30.344
to help watch over your flock

40:30.470 --> 40:32.012
if you can give them room and board.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.140
My wife always prayed for more children.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.601
We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.229
And may the gods bless you and yours.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.358
Stop it.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.987
If that's everyone,
I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.365
- Good.
- Hodor.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.159
- Hodor.
- Ah! Lord Stark.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.703
Torrhen's Square is under siege.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.373
Torrhen's Square
is barely 40 leagues from here.

40:59.833 --> 41:02.543
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

41:03.128 --> 41:05.462
Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.

41:05.547 --> 41:07.548
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.799
We have to help them.

41:08.883 --> 41:12.302
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,
but I can gather 200 decent men.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.637
Do you need so many?

41:13.721 --> 41:16.515
If we can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?

41:18.101 --> 41:20.561
Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.772
Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.743
So, what does it mean?

41:36.828 --> 41:40.330
Ask your Maester Luwin.
He's the one studying books all the time.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.750
I did ask him.
He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.170
Must not mean anything, then.

41:46.254 --> 41:47.296
You're lying.

41:47.380 --> 41:50.257
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.260
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.262
You didn't give me an honest answer.

41:55.597 --> 41:58.015
That's not the same as being a liar.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.725
Well, it's not far off.

41:59.809 --> 42:03.270
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

42:05.732 --> 42:08.984
In the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.694
Now who's a liar?

42:15.074 --> 42:16.491
What did you see in your dream?

42:19.454 --> 42:20.913
Something bad?

42:22.123 --> 42:23.624
Tell me, boy.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.630
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

42:31.466 --> 42:33.800
I saw waves crashing against the gates

42:34.969 --> 42:37.638
and the water came flowing over the walls...

42:40.141 --> 42:42.267
It flooded the castle.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.022
Drowned men were floating here,

42:47.106 --> 42:49.107
in the yard.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.946
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

42:56.783 --> 42:59.368
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

42:59.661 --> 43:00.661
I know.

43:01.496 --> 43:04.122
- It's just a stupid dream.
- I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

43:04.457 --> 43:06.250
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

43:06.334 --> 43:07.918
Osha.

43:08.294 --> 43:09.503
The three-eyed raven,

43:11.172 --> 43:14.174
what do they say about it north of the Wall?

43:16.511 --> 43:19.680
They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the Wall.

43:30.525 --> 43:33.110
- There.
- Where?

43:33.194 --> 43:34.861
On that mountain.

43:35.697 --> 43:37.447
I don't see very well.

43:37.532 --> 43:38.573
A fire.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.370
There's a fire.

43:44.289 --> 43:47.082
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.711
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

43:50.795 --> 43:54.381
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.466
How many wildlings have joined him?

43:56.551 --> 43:59.553
From what we can tell, all of them.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.477
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.229
They're almost ready to make their move.

44:10.523 --> 44:13.066
- Where?
- Somewhere safe.

44:13.234 --> 44:14.860
Somewhere south.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.571
Can't just march into their midst.

44:18.197 --> 44:21.491
And we can't wait for them here with nothing
but a pile of stones to protect us.

44:22.577 --> 44:24.578
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

44:25.330 --> 44:27.831
Mance was one of us once.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.584
Now he's one of them.

44:30.752 --> 44:33.587
He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

44:33.671 --> 44:37.507
They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

44:37.675 --> 44:41.845
They're gonna be more organized than before,
more disciplined,

44:42.305 --> 44:43.972
more like us.

44:44.432 --> 44:48.268
So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.688
Sneak in, kill Mance,

44:52.023 --> 44:55.567
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

44:55.902 --> 44:58.779
- And to do that...
- We need to get rid of those lookouts.

44:58.863 --> 45:01.198
It's not a job for 400 men.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.950
I need to move fast and silent.

45:04.535 --> 45:08.163
Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

45:08.831 --> 45:11.375
Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

45:12.710 --> 45:16.338
I've been called lots of things,
but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.883
You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

45:19.967 --> 45:21.676
I've fought and killed a wight.

45:21.761 --> 45:23.678
How many rangers can say that?

45:23.763 --> 45:25.097
He's the one?

45:26.974 --> 45:29.184
Aye. You killed a wight.

45:29.936 --> 45:33.772
You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.

45:35.441 --> 45:36.691
Craster?

45:36.776 --> 45:39.152
In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.158
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

45:46.494 --> 45:48.453
It would be no trouble.

45:57.672 --> 46:01.466
Well, I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

46:03.594 --> 46:04.886
Go on.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.312
So, tell me,

46:14.397 --> 46:17.941
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

46:18.025 --> 46:21.611
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

46:21.737 --> 46:23.363
He's my advisor,

46:23.906 --> 46:25.157
my friend.

46:25.241 --> 46:26.741
Unlikely.

46:26.868 --> 46:29.744
I can almost always tell what a man wants.

46:29.829 --> 46:32.038
And what about what a woman wants?

46:32.123 --> 46:33.999
Much more complicated.

46:34.083 --> 46:37.878
You, for example, what do you want?

46:39.088 --> 46:41.715
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.216
Why?

46:43.301 --> 46:45.177
Because I promised my khalasar
I'd protect them

46:45.261 --> 46:47.304
and find them a safe home.

46:47.555 --> 46:50.599
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

46:50.683 --> 46:52.809
I want them because they're mine by right.

46:53.186 --> 46:56.146
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

46:56.272 --> 46:57.731
Ah, a conqueror.

46:58.608 --> 47:01.067
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?

47:01.152 --> 47:05.906
No. I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

47:05.990 --> 47:08.158
except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.911
So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

47:11.245 --> 47:14.998
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.

47:19.378 --> 47:22.339
What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?

47:22.924 --> 47:25.091
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.

47:25.259 --> 47:26.259
Why?

47:28.763 --> 47:30.430
I will show you why.

47:34.101 --> 47:37.270
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

47:37.897 --> 47:41.191
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

47:41.901 --> 47:46.613
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth
their weight in gold if they could break into it.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.533
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.035
They all went home empty-handed.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.288
The only thing that can open this door

47:55.873 --> 47:57.582
is this key.

47:57.959 --> 47:59.042
And behind the door?

48:03.130 --> 48:04.548
And it can all be mine?

48:04.632 --> 48:07.467
All? Let us say half.

48:09.845 --> 48:14.099
More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...

48:14.308 --> 48:16.017
Enough to go home.

48:16.811 --> 48:18.895
All I have to do?

48:19.522 --> 48:20.605
Is marry me.

48:21.607 --> 48:24.067
That was a romantic proposal.

48:24.193 --> 48:28.029
I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.

48:31.450 --> 48:33.285
I come from nothing.

48:33.369 --> 48:36.204
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

48:36.330 --> 48:39.624
But marry me,
and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms

48:39.709 --> 48:43.086
and our children
will be princes and princesses.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.132
See?

48:47.216 --> 48:49.926
I have more ambition than you thought.

48:51.470 --> 48:55.098
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.

48:56.517 --> 48:58.059
Robert Baratheon is dead.

49:05.276 --> 49:07.360
If you cross the sea
with an army you bought...

49:07.445 --> 49:09.779
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war with one another.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.365
Four false kings destroying the country.

49:12.450 --> 49:15.118
To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.495
The usurper is dead.

49:17.580 --> 49:20.999
The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.

49:21.083 --> 49:24.377
According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

49:24.462 --> 49:27.505
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

49:27.590 --> 49:30.216
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.802
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

49:32.887 --> 49:35.930
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

49:36.015 --> 49:39.184
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.519
And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

49:41.604 --> 49:43.229
we'd all be dead by now.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.483
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

49:46.567 --> 49:50.070
- but you must...
- Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

49:52.615 --> 49:54.407
- I only want...
- What do you want?

49:55.076 --> 49:56.534
Tell me.

49:57.244 --> 50:00.246
- To see you on the Iron Throne.
- Why?

50:00.331 --> 50:01.623
You have a good claim.

50:01.707 --> 50:03.917
A title. A birthright.

50:05.252 --> 50:07.671
But you have something more than that.

50:08.255 --> 50:12.217
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

50:12.301 --> 50:15.470
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

50:17.264 --> 50:19.432
Someone who can rule and should rule.

50:19.558 --> 50:22.519
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

50:24.146 --> 50:28.608
There are times when I look at you
and I still can't believe you're real.

50:40.579 --> 50:43.915
So what would you have me do,
as my advisor?

50:49.630 --> 50:51.381
Make your own way.

50:51.841 --> 50:54.592
Find your own ship. You only need one.

50:54.677 --> 50:57.470
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

50:59.473 --> 51:01.474
And how do I get the ship?

51:01.726 --> 51:03.560
I'll find it for you.

51:03.978 --> 51:06.312
A sound ship with a good captain.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.279
I look forward to meeting him.

51:17.867 --> 51:19.659
Khaleesi.

51:49.565 --> 51:51.483
You should stand sideface.

51:51.567 --> 51:52.567
Sideface?

51:54.278 --> 51:56.070
Sideways.

51:56.155 --> 51:57.447
Why?

51:57.531 --> 51:59.365
Smaller target.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.411
Am I fighting someone?

52:03.662 --> 52:04.746
You're practicing for a fight.

52:07.249 --> 52:08.374
You should practice right.

52:12.087 --> 52:13.254
Guards!

52:15.674 --> 52:17.467
Did you see anything?

52:19.386 --> 52:22.388
Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

52:27.561 --> 52:28.728
Go up the battlement.

52:37.279 --> 52:38.696
Move away.

52:41.033 --> 52:42.909
Stand back. He's dead.
