Monday everywhere I looked.

the dark corners of my room.

off the bed until morning

01:07.919 --> 01:10.320
because I knew she was
hiding under my bed

01:10.354 --> 01:12.489
waiting for the perfect
opportunity to grab my feet

take her pictures.

would let Ashley-Kae

04:28.719 --> 04:30.520
do something she wanted to do.

04:31.789 --> 04:33.891
So, does your sister
wanna be an archeologist

04:33.925 --> 04:34.826
- or something?
- Yeah,

04:34.859 --> 04:36.459

I'm her friend.

I just didn't know that
she likes old churches.

04:54.745 --> 04:58.182

and history, and dumb stuff.

Besides, the only way my
parents would let us use

05:01.552 --> 05:04.589

is if I brought her along.

this going to take?

the way up to Asheville,

pump the breaks.

about this place, Ash?

This is Old
Horse Creek Church.

06:49.860 --> 06:52.063
It used to be a convent,
and about 30 nuns lived here

06:52.096 --> 06:55.132
until a mysterious fire
burned it down in 1945.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.634
Mysterious fire?

06:56.667 --> 07:00.304

fucking torches for lights.

07:03.407 --> 07:05.276
All the nuns were either
moved to other convents

07:05.309 --> 07:07.878
or assigned different duties
in surrounding cities.

07:09.046 --> 07:11.716
But there was one
nun, Sister Monday,

07:12.883 --> 07:14.517
who took a job at
a nearby prison.

Sister Monday is
the most remembered

07:17.455 --> 07:19.056
of all the nuns that lived here.

07:20.458 --> 07:22.026
She's always been
obsessed with the nuns.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.430
So, what made Sister
Monday so remembered?

07:31.836 --> 07:33.536
Because she was accused
of killing prisoners

07:33.571 --> 07:36.240
while they were at the jail
serving out their sentences.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.110

begged for mercy.

them at the church.

saying at the church,

she was suspected of killing
prisoners here in the jail.

started turning up,

13:05.536 --> 13:08.038

was wrong, I mean, apart from

the occasional suicide or

13:10.709 --> 13:11.942
fight between prisoners,

13:11.975 --> 13:14.011
there was just way too
many deaths occurring.

13:15.112 --> 13:16.413
The warden suspected
Sister Monday,

13:16.447 --> 13:17.749
but before she could officially

13:17.782 --> 13:20.484
be brought in for
questioning, she disappeared.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.020
disappeared?

Vanished without a trace.

13:30.894 --> 13:31.730
Right.

13:33.598 --> 13:35.966
I mean, eventually, the
place had to close down

13:37.868 --> 13:39.236

13:39.269 --> 13:41.305
and no one wants to
privately invest in a jail.

13:42.574 --> 13:44.274
and no one heard from
Sister Monday again.

happily ever after.

if you get scared,

those stories anymore.

visited the cell of a prisoner

he did unspeakable things.

me these stories

into prisoners' jail cells

And later they would be
found dead and would just

assumed to have killed themselves
or died of natural causes.

38:10.473 --> 38:13.543
Afterwards, I'd be
too afraid to sleep.

38:14.912 --> 38:17.547
I would see Sister Monday
everywhere I looked.

38:19.016 --> 38:21.853

the dark corners of my room.

hiding under my bed

he spent time with me.

that he only shared with me.

he didn't tell Gabby,
