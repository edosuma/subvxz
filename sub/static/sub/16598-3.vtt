00:01.001 --> 00:02.403
Previously on The Exorcist...

00:02.436 --> 00:04.172
It is you.
What do you want?

00:04.205 --> 00:06.174
I had a dream,
and you were in it.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.309
There was a child
tied to a bed.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.579
You called him Gabriel.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.914
This ends now!
Bennett.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.015
You would shoot me?

00:15.049 --> 00:16.417
Without hesitation.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.919
Rome will not forgive this,
Marcus.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.422
His Holiness's visit is
a month away, and you're on

00:21.455 --> 00:23.891
the welcoming committee. You
keep your energy on the job.

00:23.924 --> 00:24.992
This-this girl...

00:25.025 --> 00:27.328
You've been noticed, Tomas.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.197
I think there's something
really wrong with me.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.331
I'm afraid not,
my dear.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.267
Now, tell me everything.

00:35.069 --> 00:38.206
CASEY: (whispering):
So, this has to be
a secret, okay?

00:38.239 --> 00:39.440
ANGELA:
She's not herself, Henry.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.275
She's not herself.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.777
MARCUS:
...that you

00:43.811 --> 00:46.847
tell me by some sign your name!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.116
(in demonic voice):
I am the Baptist!

00:48.149 --> 00:49.783
...and the hour
of your departure!

00:49.817 --> 00:51.119
I am the Baptist!

00:51.152 --> 00:54.288
The hour or your departure,
Baptist!

00:54.322 --> 00:55.589
You came and begged me for help

00:55.623 --> 00:57.125
with a case
of demonic possession,

00:57.158 --> 00:58.626
and now you got your knickers
in a twist

00:58.659 --> 00:59.960
'cause I don't
bring you flowers?

00:59.993 --> 01:01.962
I don't actually know you.
No.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.332
I don't know you.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.144
REPORTER (on TV):
...the victims did not die
from gunfire.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.011
These were all brutal stabbings.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.583
*

01:22.616 --> 01:25.453
So, Derek was sweating you
pretty hard tonight.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.121
WOMAN (laughing):
Oh, God, he was

01:27.155 --> 01:28.789
all up on it.
Who grinds anymore?

01:28.822 --> 01:31.091
What is this? 1997?

01:31.125 --> 01:34.128
* White noise...
Plus he's, uh, not my type.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.596
* It's what you've learned
to speak... *

01:35.629 --> 01:37.331
What is your type?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.267
I think you know.
* It's in your bloodstream...

01:39.300 --> 01:41.169
Do I?
Uh-huh.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.970
* Crossfade
* Crossfade *

01:43.003 --> 01:44.838
* The truth is killing you...
Remind me.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.509
Strong, athletic,
legs for days.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.245
Smart, but plays dumb.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.682
Nope. No one comes to mind.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.317
* In the freezer at night

01:56.350 --> 01:58.652
* To fight temptation

01:58.686 --> 01:59.853
* Over and over and...

01:59.887 --> 02:01.189
You're not surprised.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.523
* And, oh, it kills me...

02:02.556 --> 02:04.792
No.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.195
I mean, I don't know.
I wasn't sure.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.630
You know I can't
keep my eyes off you.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.334
* Becoming a specter
of what you used to dream... *

02:13.367 --> 02:15.035
You mean, like,
when we're dancing?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.804
That-that doesn't
mean anything.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.139
We all watch each other
all the time.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.875
When I'm behind you at barre,
I can't focus on the music.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.512
I smell your perfume
when you start to sweat,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.980
and then
I'm kissing your neck,

02:27.014 --> 02:28.949
your collarbone.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.885
I get all messed up.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.222
What is it...

02:34.255 --> 02:36.724
about me... for you?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.058
*

02:38.091 --> 02:40.060
* Has all your wilding

02:40.093 --> 02:41.395
It's your face.

02:41.429 --> 02:44.732
It's... your eyes.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.734
* Are you tracing

02:46.767 --> 02:49.703
It sounds stupid, but it's like
they're lit from behind.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.205
They're alive.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.507
* Dialing my number...

02:53.541 --> 02:55.409
I feel stupid.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.745
Go on.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.648
Your mouth.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.316
Especially when
you're concentrating,

03:02.350 --> 03:05.219
or right before
you're about to laugh.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.055
And those damn cheekbones.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.057
I mean...

03:10.090 --> 03:11.925
they're ridiculous.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.193
Kat,

03:13.227 --> 03:14.595
look at me.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.598
* You're driving
Santa Monica... *

03:17.631 --> 03:19.733
(gasps, tires squeal)

03:20.968 --> 03:24.372
(distant dogs barking)

03:26.974 --> 03:29.410
(coughing)

03:29.443 --> 03:31.479
(wheezes, coughs)

03:33.547 --> 03:36.684
(coughing, gasping for air)

03:36.717 --> 03:38.185
(panting)

03:38.218 --> 03:40.187
Ow!

03:40.220 --> 03:41.722
Ah!

03:41.755 --> 03:44.091
(panting)

03:44.124 --> 03:47.094
(grunts)

03:47.127 --> 03:50.864
Julia? Julia, wake up!

03:50.898 --> 03:52.933
Julia... wake up.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.804
(grunting)

03:56.837 --> 03:58.306
(panting)

04:01.509 --> 04:02.910
Help!

04:02.943 --> 04:04.645
(wheezy panting)

04:04.678 --> 04:06.146
Help!

04:06.179 --> 04:07.415
(crying):
Help!

04:07.448 --> 04:09.450
(banging on door, coughing)

04:11.352 --> 04:13.354
(screaming):
Help!

04:16.357 --> 04:19.793
*

04:47.788 --> 04:50.458
Your country is desolate.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.926
Your cities burning with fire!

04:52.960 --> 04:55.996
Your land,
strangers plunder,

04:56.029 --> 04:57.465
devour.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.368
Before your eyes,
invaders take the temple.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.770
Super. Just what we need.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.539
Joseph, see if you can
do something with him.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.540
Yeah. Come on.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.175
...destroy
everything

05:08.208 --> 05:09.443
they see.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.245
(loud gasping,
rattled breathing)

05:14.582 --> 05:17.050
(gasping)
Easy, buddy.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.387
You okay?
Look, look, come on,
get to your feet.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.395
Welcome. Hello.
Yes, hello.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.163
How wonderful to have you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.832
Angela Rance.
Welcome.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.233
Father Devin Bennett.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.503
Prefect of Papal Outreach
and Security.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.406
It's an honor to have you here,
Father Bennett.

05:38.439 --> 05:41.341
...the Devil will come to take
your children in the night!

05:41.375 --> 05:43.911
You... you...

05:43.944 --> 05:46.113
Kind of makes you question
free speech, right?

05:48.549 --> 05:51.919
This way.
MAN:
Invaders reside among you!

05:51.952 --> 05:53.854
This way.
Blemish the city,
ravish the people!

05:53.887 --> 05:55.556
Satan will get you!

05:55.589 --> 05:59.226
Fear for your children,
for they will perish.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.595
(siren blaring,
garbled radio transmission)

06:01.629 --> 06:03.597
Check it, Five-O
doing a sweep.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.599
Yeah, there you go.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.367
Scratch that big-ass belly.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.937
Mm, better check
the fridge. Might be

06:09.970 --> 06:11.939
a perp in there.
(laughs)

06:11.972 --> 06:13.441
Oh, he tired now.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.675
All the brothers he been bagging

06:14.708 --> 06:16.109
cutting into his beauty sleep.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.678
He needs a vacay!

06:17.711 --> 06:19.112
Ah, you know what
he's thinking.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.214
"Now I got to go
arrest some white guy."

06:21.248 --> 06:22.883
Ain't nobody
in this hood beast enough

06:22.916 --> 06:24.217
to cut out nobody's eyeballs.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.919
That's that crazy
white boy 101.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.021
Like, you know he got
to have two first names.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.723
Jonathan Percy Wilkerson.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.391
Or Richard Aaron McCoy.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.527
Yeah, but he go by "Dickie"
'cause he got a...

06:33.561 --> 06:34.795
You said they
took the eyes?

06:34.828 --> 06:37.731
I didn't
say it to you.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.299
What else did
they take?

06:39.332 --> 06:40.801
Why? You a cop?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.570
Do I look like a cop?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.271
Yep.
Yeah.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.806
But one of them
scary cops, though.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.575
Like you ain't got
no friends.
(laughs)

06:49.142 --> 06:50.911
Oh, really?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.446
Oh, that's for real?

06:52.480 --> 06:55.883
Look, man, all I know
is what I heard.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.585
What exactly
did you hear?

07:03.156 --> 07:06.259
You're a modern
guy, Father.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.061
You don't really
believe in demons

07:08.095 --> 07:09.930
and the Devil and all that.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.431
I mean, those are just stories,
right?

07:11.465 --> 07:13.433
Is this about Casey?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.569
You agree with Angela?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.671
Casey's possessed?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.843
What's happening
with Casey is complicated.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.948
I think
that if you believe in God,

07:27.981 --> 07:31.752
maybe... maybe we have
to accept the possibility

07:31.785 --> 07:34.021
that he has an adversary.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.757
I pray at night.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.493
A lot more now.

07:39.527 --> 07:42.863
I ask Him
what I would be doing

07:42.896 --> 07:46.099
if that scaffolding
hadn't collapsed,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.101
screwed my head up.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.403
I don't trust
myself now.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.440
Something's wrong
with my little girl.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.442
I know.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.178
I see it, too.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.815
So what am I supposed to do now?

08:01.849 --> 08:04.518
(doors close loudly)

08:12.526 --> 08:14.027
I know someone.

08:14.061 --> 08:17.097
He knows about these things.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.311
KAT:
Case? Case,
let me see.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.914
No.
I'm coming in.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.550
That's great.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.586
Totally you. We done?

08:38.619 --> 08:40.921
Don't pretend like
you don't care about this thing.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.590
It's her memorial.

08:42.623 --> 08:46.193
Yeah. And, yeah, fine...

08:46.226 --> 08:47.895
I'm kind of dreading it.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.930
And I'm sorry
that Mom's being a psycho

08:49.963 --> 08:51.264
and making you come, too.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.500
Well, I'm here for you.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.937
You know, if you get
nervous or sad,

08:56.970 --> 08:59.506
I got your back, okay?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.242
Seriously,
that dress looks good.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.477
We should go.
I'll meet you out front in ten.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.785
SALESMAN:
Classic Kat exit.

09:11.819 --> 09:16.023
Trailing clouds
of me, me, me.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.626
You see what she's wearing?

09:18.659 --> 09:21.228
Not some boxy frock,
that's for certain.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.532
Sketched in Milan,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.901
stitched in Bangladesh.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.905
It catches light, opens doors,
and gets what it wants.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.274
(laughs):
I couldn't fit into that.

09:34.307 --> 09:38.411
You will just fit into it,
which is the point, my beauty.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.447
Take it.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.152
It's $3,600.
There's no way.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.089
There's nothing
but ways.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.760
Stuff it

09:52.793 --> 09:54.662
in the bottom
of your bag.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.364
You mustn't keep
the Kat waiting.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.602
HENRY:
Are you picking up
on anything in the house?

10:02.636 --> 10:05.773
An energy
or a presence?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.941
It doesn't work that way.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.714
How do it work?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.525
Casey?
Yes.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.761
She didn't really
take to it.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.462
She's more of a...

10:29.496 --> 10:32.332
Rough and tumble.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.334
Your other
daughter's a dancer?

10:34.367 --> 10:37.270
Yes. Kat.
Katherine.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.240
How long have you known
Father Tomas?

10:41.341 --> 10:43.310
Are they friends?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.312
They're sisters.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.114
That's not what I asked.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.348
ANGELA:
They're...

10:48.381 --> 10:51.719
they're sisters
and friends.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.222
(music box playing)

10:58.225 --> 11:01.328
I'd like to speak
to your daughter.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.996
MARIA:
My husband would want me
to thank you,

11:03.030 --> 11:05.733
Cardinal Guillot, for
your diligence in planning

11:05.766 --> 11:09.002
the Pope's motorcade with
Chicago's commerce in mind.
(translating softly)

11:09.036 --> 11:11.471
Whoever said
the Church

11:11.504 --> 11:14.574
wasn't strategic was... Wait.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.643
Nobody ever said that.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.778
(laughter)

11:19.780 --> 11:22.382
(speaking French)

11:30.858 --> 11:32.392
Indeed,
Mrs. Walters.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.095
I believe this approach
will not only bolster the faith

11:35.128 --> 11:37.831
of your most influential
parishioners

11:37.865 --> 11:39.733
but will benefit
Chicago as well.

11:39.767 --> 11:43.236
It is wonderful
when collaboration results

11:43.270 --> 11:45.538
in added value for all.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.776
(translating softly)
That said, I wonder
if we shouldn't consider

11:48.809 --> 11:50.677
His Holiness's desire

11:50.710 --> 11:52.880
to spend a bit more time
in Chicago's

11:52.913 --> 11:55.682
depleted
regions.

11:55.715 --> 12:00.020
Respectfully, our objections
to altering the itinerary,

12:00.053 --> 12:01.588
as previously stated,

12:01.621 --> 12:03.791
is that those neighborhoods
pose additional risk

12:03.824 --> 12:05.893
to His Holiness's
safety.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.096
His Holiness has the luxury
of ignoring such matters,

12:09.129 --> 12:10.563
being a man
of the people,

12:10.597 --> 12:13.466
which is why we must consider
them on his behalf.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.435
MARIA:
Father Tomas,

12:15.468 --> 12:17.871
you take the Red Line
south from here

12:17.905 --> 12:19.539
on your way back
to your parish.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.109
Yes. Yes, I do, Mrs. Walters.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.145
Do you fear for His Holiness's
safety on this trip?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.481
Well, I'm sure there are many...

12:28.515 --> 12:31.618
logistics involved in this trip.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.687
Thank you, Father Tomas.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.927
But I think we must separate
the idea of violence

12:39.960 --> 12:41.594
in some of these neighborhoods

12:41.628 --> 12:45.132
from the everyday people
who work and live there.

12:45.165 --> 12:49.837
Father Tomas's parish is home
to hardworking Catholics.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.072
You'll forgive him if he
feels somewhat protective.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.641
I'm sorry, but there is nothing
depleted about my parish.

12:54.674 --> 12:58.078
EGAN:
This is a new environment
for my young friend.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.480
Please excuse his learning edge.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.515
(speaking French)

13:06.786 --> 13:08.755
It is good to have
a different opinion.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.523
Especially from fresh blood.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.125
Finish.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.962
First of all,
I want to say

13:14.995 --> 13:17.931
that I feel very humbled
and honored to be here.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.133
I don't mean
to cause any trouble,

13:20.167 --> 13:22.035
but the itinerary
I'm looking at has His Holiness

13:22.069 --> 13:24.371
on the South Side
for less than two hours

13:24.404 --> 13:26.974
and has him on the Gold Coast
for a day and a half.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.176
The people
of these parishes

13:29.209 --> 13:31.378
are among the diocese's
most devout.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.713
They may not have much
to offer financially,

13:33.746 --> 13:35.715
but, spiritually,

13:35.748 --> 13:37.784
they are rich.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.087
(woman screaming)
(murmuring)

13:44.992 --> 13:46.493
(muffled shouting from outside)

13:46.526 --> 13:47.827
WOMAN:
Help him!

13:47.861 --> 13:49.362
(muffled shouting continues)

13:49.396 --> 13:50.463
MAN:
Somebody help him!

13:50.497 --> 13:51.498
WOMAN:
Got to go for help right away!

13:54.734 --> 13:56.836
(bystanders screaming)

14:19.792 --> 14:22.429
I wish there was
something more I could do.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.934
Feels wrong to let her
be in there alone.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.404
Look, I know my mom thinks
I'm possessed or something.

14:31.438 --> 14:35.042
And my dad, who's usually
the rational one, is, like,

14:35.075 --> 14:38.211
freaked out now, too.
So... can we just do this quick

14:38.245 --> 14:40.347
and get it over with
and tell them both

14:40.380 --> 14:41.748
there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

14:41.781 --> 14:43.783
Okay.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.552
Um...

14:45.585 --> 14:47.955
Casey, the night

14:47.988 --> 14:49.756
I came to your home,

14:49.789 --> 14:51.858
do you remember what happened
in the attic?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.860
You...

14:53.893 --> 14:56.729
killed a rat, right?

14:56.763 --> 15:00.067
I'm sorry,
why is he here?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.135
To observe.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.770
Observe what?

15:03.803 --> 15:04.771
Uh...

15:04.804 --> 15:06.806
(speaking Spanish)

15:08.508 --> 15:11.511
Sorry. Can you say that again
in English?

15:15.949 --> 15:18.751
TOMAS:
Can you move that pen?

15:18.785 --> 15:21.721
Not... with
your hand.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.290
Can you do that?

15:23.323 --> 15:25.725
Um...
(clears throat)

15:25.758 --> 15:28.161
I'd like to ask you
a series of questions,

15:28.195 --> 15:31.764
if you don't mind, Casey.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.968
Okay.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.508
I understand you're quite
the accomplished athlete.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.676
CASEY:
I mean,

15:43.710 --> 15:46.646
I'm not that great.
I'm just... I'm okay, really.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.148
I think you're being modest.
'Cause I know

15:48.181 --> 15:51.784
that sportsmanship runs
in your family.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.786
Although ballet, it's...

15:53.820 --> 15:55.989
it's more of an art
than a sport,

15:56.023 --> 15:57.157
I suppose.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.491
Yeah, I guess.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.592
The artist

15:59.626 --> 16:01.294
and the athlete.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.430
Let me guess,
she's the difficult one.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.333
I mean, sometimes...
Do you garden?

16:06.366 --> 16:07.334
What?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.501
Plants.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.670
Not really.

16:10.703 --> 16:14.641
The thing about gardening is
the more beautiful the plant,

16:14.674 --> 16:16.809
the more trouble it gives you.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.345
And the really

16:18.378 --> 16:20.113
beautiful ones,
they're always fighting

16:20.147 --> 16:22.349
tooth and claw for attention.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.384
Sunlight, water--
they'll soak up

16:24.417 --> 16:26.286
every last drop
they can get,

16:26.319 --> 16:29.122
even if they have to choke the
life out of every other plant

16:29.156 --> 16:30.557
in that box.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.492
That's your top layer.

16:32.525 --> 16:36.229
Then, down below,
you've got your succulents.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.830
Sturdy,
resilient,

16:37.864 --> 16:39.799
don't need much
attention to survive.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.801
Are you asking
if I'm a succulent?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.703
Do you love your sister?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.205
Of course.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.339
Do you like your sister?

16:46.373 --> 16:49.209
I mean, yeah.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.477
But you resent her.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.811
I didn't say that.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.180
Didn't have to.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.914
She was selfish
and careless

16:54.947 --> 16:56.649
and her accident broke
your family in half,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.385
and you resent her for it.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.253
I... That's not true.
Do you like
your sister?

17:00.287 --> 17:01.821
Sometimes.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.022
And sometimes you don't.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.524
Yeah,
it's called having a sister.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.260
It's called being
a punching bag, the one everyone

17:07.294 --> 17:08.728
takes for granted,
No...

17:08.761 --> 17:10.930
the one nobody
gives a damn about.
What is this?

17:10.963 --> 17:12.199
Boring, invisible

17:12.232 --> 17:13.032
Casey.

17:13.066 --> 17:13.866
Go to hell.

17:13.900 --> 17:14.934
Casey,

17:14.967 --> 17:16.569
we're trying
to help.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.742
Where did you get that?

17:22.775 --> 17:24.177
Where do you think?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.512
(music box playing)

17:25.545 --> 17:27.214
You went in my room?

17:47.967 --> 17:49.669
(music stops)

17:53.340 --> 17:56.309
(clicking tongue)

17:56.343 --> 17:58.578
Seven years' bad luck.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.414
Isn't that what they say?

18:01.448 --> 18:03.416
Who gave this
to you, Casey?

18:03.450 --> 18:06.453
Bundled away in your
garish little music box.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.655
See, it looks like an antique,

18:08.688 --> 18:11.624
but it's quite cheap, isn't it?

18:11.658 --> 18:14.594
Lund & Tyler,
2003.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.062
What is that,
a department store?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.330
SALESMAN:
Don't look at me.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.665
Look at them.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.234
Who gave this to you, Casey?

18:21.268 --> 18:23.736
A salesman.
Stop talking.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.838
See, that don't make
a lot of sense to me--

18:25.872 --> 18:28.841
a compact for a tomboy.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.445
You were a
beautiful girl.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.014
I was beautiful.
Not beautiful

18:35.047 --> 18:37.150
like your sister,
so he must have lied to you

18:37.184 --> 18:38.685
to make you feel special--
did it work?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.420
Did this gift, this compact,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.622
did it make you
feel special?
He doesn't lie!

18:42.655 --> 18:45.192
MARCUS:
The man who gave you this,

18:45.225 --> 18:48.027
is he in this room with us
right now?

19:01.541 --> 19:03.543
Has it hurt you yet?

19:03.576 --> 19:05.878
SALESMAN:
Get up and walk out.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.147
He would never hurt me.
Stop talking.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.949
Because it will.
Tell your brain...

19:09.982 --> 19:11.318
Please, can I go now?

19:11.351 --> 19:12.619
It didn't give you this compact.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.853
...to tell your legs...

19:13.886 --> 19:15.488
It went mucking about
in your head, and it took

19:15.522 --> 19:17.624
that form when you let it in.
I really don't want
to be here.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.559
...to get up...
Casey, please.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.527
...and walk out.
Please, I just...

19:20.560 --> 19:21.861
I just want to go home.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.197
(glass shatters)

19:24.231 --> 19:27.567
I'm speaking now to the
presence inside Casey Rance.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.936
In the name of God the Father,
I command your response.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.905
(wind howling)

19:32.939 --> 19:34.307
(speaking Latin)

19:34.341 --> 19:35.842
(rattling)

19:35.875 --> 19:38.110
(speaking German)

19:41.013 --> 19:43.015
(speaking Japanese)

19:44.684 --> 19:47.220
Why her?

19:47.254 --> 19:49.722
She's nothing exceptional.
She's not like Kat.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.057
What?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.725
What are you doing?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.160
But you couldn't get
the good one,

19:54.193 --> 19:55.328
could you, so
you had to settle

19:55.362 --> 19:56.563
for this.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.198
Aw, look, now it's gonna cry.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.234
I want to go home.
Hope you're happy

20:01.268 --> 20:03.002
with this, your sad
little consolation prize.
Marcus, stop.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.171
This is too much.
You're going too far.
I want to go home.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.507
(rattling, rumbling)

20:07.540 --> 20:10.543
Unless you didn't choose her.
Unless she chose you.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.114
(speaking Aramaic)

20:20.320 --> 20:22.322
(speaking Aramaic
in demonic voice)

20:34.434 --> 20:35.902
What is your name?

20:35.935 --> 20:38.871
(demonic voice):
The boy sends his regards.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.207
What was his name?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.410
Ah, yes.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.077
Gabriel.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.213
The sound

20:47.246 --> 20:49.549
his neck made when it snapped.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.651
(clicks tongue)

20:51.684 --> 20:54.887
Like a machete parting bamboo.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.156
Hello, Baptist.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.092
Never felt more alive than
when he died in front of you.

21:00.126 --> 21:03.463
The universe
burst open.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.998
The eye of God dilated wide,

21:06.032 --> 21:10.002
and you were at the center
of His disinterest.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.104
(huffs)

21:12.138 --> 21:14.106
No, I'm not the Baptist.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.275
But I appreciate his work.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.610
That's enough.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.313
Left quite a dent
in your topside.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.482
All corn mush up
in there.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.050
Enough!

21:37.163 --> 21:39.532
(Casey speaking Aramaic
on video)

21:42.502 --> 21:44.337
You've been busy, Tomas.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.473
The problem presented itself;
I did not look for it.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.508
It's a possession.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.143
It vaults over the
standard of proof.

21:51.177 --> 21:54.046
We believe an exorcism
should be granted.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.148
The image is grainy;
the sound barely audible.

21:56.182 --> 21:59.151
(laughing):
She spoke Aramaic, Bennett.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.454
Are they teaching that
in the public schools here?

22:01.488 --> 22:03.390
We've gone forward with less.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.458
Can you illuminate the
auxiliarized one here?

22:05.492 --> 22:09.562
This girl needs
psychiatric attention.

22:09.596 --> 22:13.533
But I'm repeating myself,
am I not, Father Tomas?

22:13.566 --> 22:16.803
If we deny her this, her life
is going to be in danger.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.906
Have you talked
to Father Marcus? No,

22:19.939 --> 22:21.708
Bishop Egan, I have not.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.243
Take the girl to
a psychiatrist, yes.

22:24.276 --> 22:27.480
But first,
let my excommunicated friend

22:27.514 --> 22:30.750
interrogate her
like she's in Guantanamo.
Do what?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.018
We need to do something
for this girl.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.219
Come again?

22:33.252 --> 22:35.655
You lied to me, Tomas.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.590
I am very
disappointed in you.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.360
From Rome?

22:41.394 --> 22:43.162
Your excommunication.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.197
The order effective
immediately.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.599
You're to relinquish
your collar,

22:46.633 --> 22:48.735
your right to serve Mass,
to take communion.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.370
Why?

22:51.404 --> 22:53.506
You pulled a gun
on a fellow priest.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.041
You conducted an exorcism

22:55.074 --> 22:56.709
that resulted in the death
of a child.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.277
You left Saint Aquinas
without permission.

22:58.310 --> 23:00.212
You interrogated
a mentally unfit young woman

23:00.246 --> 23:01.581
without the supervision of...

23:01.614 --> 23:04.183
This is completely different.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.420
The demon inside that girl
knew about me in Mexico City.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.021
Do you understand?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.523
They're communicating
with one another.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.425
They are sharing
information.

23:12.459 --> 23:13.593
The Church is providing
three months' resources

23:13.626 --> 23:14.694
for you to begin
your civilian life.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.395
(scoffs)

23:16.429 --> 23:18.698
The diocese would appreciate it
if you would begin it outside

23:18.731 --> 23:21.801
Chicago, Mr. Keane.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.538
The string of murders

23:25.572 --> 23:28.708
on the south side
of the city.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.044
They took the eyes, the heart,
the liver, the genitals,

23:32.078 --> 23:33.946
the skin off the palms
and the bottom of the feet.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.414
Why aren't you--?
Shut up!

23:37.349 --> 23:39.285
See him out.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.490
Yeah, I'm quite
capable. Thank you.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.562
HENRY:
So, what? You seem upset.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.330
Was it-- what did you want them
to say? I don't know.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.399
ANGELA:
Well, they should have
told us more

23:53.432 --> 23:56.002
about what happened in there.
We're still her parents.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.670
HENRY:
Look, we'll do
what they told us to do.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.939
We'll just try and maintain
daily life for her,

23:59.972 --> 24:01.140
and keep things normal.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.575
KAT:
None of these look right.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.443
I can't believe
you're making me go.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.245
ANGELA:
Kat, I know you're upset, honey,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.247
but no one is making you go.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.483
If it's too much, if you don't
want to commemorate your friend,

24:10.517 --> 24:12.284
it's fine;
we can stay home.

24:12.318 --> 24:15.021
KAT:
Her name is Julia.
If you call her "my friend"

24:15.054 --> 24:16.422
in that little way
that you say "friend," again...

24:16.455 --> 24:17.590
ANGELA:
What little way?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.091
KAT:
Your friend.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.259
Her name is Julia.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.828
Was Julia.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.429
HENRY:
You're being unfair, Kat.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.264
ANGELA:
I didn't know I was doing that.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.766
KAT:
You know what's unfair?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.100
Committing an entire life
to something

24:28.134 --> 24:30.503
that was taken away
in 30 seconds.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.271
My knee is garbage now, okay?

24:32.304 --> 24:34.106
ANGELA:
Your knee?

24:34.140 --> 24:37.443
KAT:
You pushed-- one class,
three classes...

24:37.476 --> 24:38.477
(conversation fades)

24:40.246 --> 24:41.548
(sizzling)

24:41.581 --> 24:43.583
(groans)

24:49.589 --> 24:51.591
(breathing hard)

25:00.366 --> 25:02.735
(short laugh)

25:05.605 --> 25:07.607
*

25:08.941 --> 25:10.209
(door closes)

25:14.446 --> 25:17.850
I was looking
for you all day.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.085
Last pew.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.253
Crackerjack work,
detective.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.258
Are you drunk?

25:26.292 --> 25:31.163
41 years of sobriety,
poverty, chastity.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.233
More or less.

25:34.266 --> 25:37.770
I'm allowed the indulgence.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.841
What they did to you today,
it was...

25:41.874 --> 25:44.711
I cannot think what you
must be feeling right now.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.013
Right now it's a very pleasant
spinning sensation.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.748
Don't give up, okay?
(scoffs)

25:48.781 --> 25:51.784
This... this family
is depending on us.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.253
What are we supposed
to do about it?

25:54.286 --> 25:56.689
Do you think I'm the one
that defeats the demon?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.390
Sad-ass little me,
all by myself?

25:58.424 --> 26:00.059
No. No.
Of course not.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.695
This is a vessel for the glory

26:02.729 --> 26:04.230
of our Lord and Savior.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.633
You take away that grace...

26:06.666 --> 26:08.935
I'm a man in a room.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.403
God did not abandon you,
that was the Church.

26:11.437 --> 26:12.705
Oh, yeah, great.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.473
Let's fight the enemy
with semantics,

26:14.506 --> 26:16.809
'cause that will be
a really fun way to cock it.
Okay.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.077
I can do it.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.311
(scoffs)

26:19.345 --> 26:20.479
You can advise me.

26:20.512 --> 26:23.049
A surgeon loses his hands,

26:23.082 --> 26:25.952
you don't give the scalpel
to the man mopping the floor.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.487
Then teach me.
Show me what to do.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.822
You want to
help this girl?

26:29.856 --> 26:32.091
Yes. Yes. I want
to help this girl.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.226
Observe.
Do not interact.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.928
Collect your evidence,
wait for the demon...

26:35.962 --> 26:38.297
That's just what
I've been doing.
No! Listen!

26:39.531 --> 26:42.501
You wait for the demon
to manifest itself in full.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.737
We went too soon.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.305
You get unassailable proof.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.308
And don't you worry,
'cause that much is coming.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.943
Get your evidence,
run to the bishop,

26:50.977 --> 26:52.444
and if you're lucky,
he'll send someone.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.113
God put you in my head
for a reason.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.682
Why? I don't know why.

26:55.715 --> 26:59.118
You know what happens
if you defy the Church?

26:59.151 --> 27:00.519
You walk into that room
without any skill,

27:00.552 --> 27:02.154
without any training,

27:02.188 --> 27:04.757
it's not just your career
on the line, Tomas.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.259
It's your immortal soul.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.995
It'll take you.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.297
It'll destroy you.

27:11.330 --> 27:15.668
That's a ghost
I don't want in my head.

27:15.702 --> 27:19.538
I'll not be
responsible for you.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.573
Well, I'm not
going to quit.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.780
Then you'll die, too.

27:27.814 --> 27:28.948
(door opens)

27:28.981 --> 27:31.350
(indistinct chatter)

27:31.383 --> 27:34.520
Kat!

27:34.553 --> 27:36.222
Hey, Kat.
Glad you made it.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.457
* I don't expect much
Kat, how are you?

27:38.490 --> 27:39.625
Are you okay?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.794
* Of anything from you

27:41.828 --> 27:43.730
* And if the rain

27:43.763 --> 27:45.197
Excuse me.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.766
* Don't wash away

27:48.234 --> 27:50.036
* All the things
you used to do *

27:50.069 --> 27:52.071
(indistinct chatter)

27:54.673 --> 27:58.010
* And I don't care

27:58.044 --> 28:00.012
* What I carry...
FALLON: Hey, can you turn
the music down?

28:00.046 --> 28:02.348
Hey, ladies.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.350
Everyone, gather around.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.021
So...

28:09.055 --> 28:11.924
yeah.
Julia.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.927
Gorgeous. Fun.

28:14.961 --> 28:18.731
Always losing her keys.

28:18.765 --> 28:19.932
(quiet laughter)

28:19.966 --> 28:23.035
Always locking herself
out of her dorm.

28:24.937 --> 28:28.775
The most fearsome fouettes
in the whole company.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.544
There's a big hole here.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.280
(inhales)

28:34.313 --> 28:38.017
Also, she hated champagne.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.052
(laughter)

28:40.086 --> 28:44.390
I think we all know Julia
was more of a whiskey girl.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.727
To Jules.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.429
Julia.
ALL:
To Jules.

28:57.469 --> 29:00.706
(indistinct conversations)

29:00.739 --> 29:02.741
*

29:10.917 --> 29:13.219
WOMAN:
What is she doing?

29:13.252 --> 29:16.122
(indistinct exclaiming)

29:16.155 --> 29:18.157
WOMAN 2(whispering):
Is that Kat's sister?

29:19.425 --> 29:21.427
*

29:29.869 --> 29:31.871
Shut up.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.054
(indistinct conversations)

29:50.156 --> 29:52.458
Please, just leave.
Go over with Mom and Dad.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.626
You're being totally
inappropriate right now.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.862
Hey, you know my
sister not only

29:55.895 --> 29:57.329
lost her best
friend that night,

29:57.363 --> 29:59.298
but the love of
her life, right?
Stop.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.432
I'm Kat's sister,
by the way, Casey.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.500
Stop it!
Hi!

30:01.533 --> 30:04.103
Yeah. Such a tragedy.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.704
True love gone.

30:05.737 --> 30:06.839
What a shame.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.440
I'm just grateful

30:08.474 --> 30:10.342
that my sister survived.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.844
Imagine if the car

30:11.878 --> 30:13.212
had swerved the other way,
it would have been

30:13.245 --> 30:17.116
Kat killed,
not Julia.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.518
And Julia would have been
the one with the busted knee.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.220
FALLON:
Um, 15 minutes till curtain.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.689
Let's maybe have
our guests clear out.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.626
What the hell
is wrong with you?

30:27.659 --> 30:30.296
Me? Not a thing.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.998
(applause)

30:40.772 --> 30:42.875
Tonight's performance
is dedicated

30:42.909 --> 30:46.212
to two women in our company.

30:46.245 --> 30:50.182
One who's gone,
and one who's still with us.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.651
Julia Clark
and Katherine Rance.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.255
We miss you every day, Julia.

30:56.288 --> 30:59.658
Kat, we're here for you
when you're ready.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.593
* Candle wax

31:01.627 --> 31:03.495
* Drips on the floor

31:03.529 --> 31:05.531
*

31:07.133 --> 31:09.035
* Heat blows out

31:09.068 --> 31:14.006
* When you open the door

31:14.040 --> 31:18.544
* Where did our love go?

31:18.577 --> 31:22.448
* Is it still out there
somewhere? *

31:22.481 --> 31:26.685
* Is it achin'

31:26.718 --> 31:30.189
* In the cold, cold wind?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.724
* It's good

31:34.927 --> 31:37.596
* Candle wax

31:37.629 --> 31:40.632
* Drips on the floor

31:42.734 --> 31:45.237
* Heat blows out

31:45.271 --> 31:48.274
* When you open the door

31:50.176 --> 31:54.046
* Where did our love go?

31:54.080 --> 31:58.384
* Is it still out there
somewhere? *

31:58.417 --> 32:02.621
* Is it achin'

32:02.654 --> 32:06.692
* In the cold, cold wind?

32:10.963 --> 32:12.898
MARIA:
Hell of a view.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.067
Mrs. Walters.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

32:15.101 --> 32:17.269
I was saying good night
to my husband.

32:17.303 --> 32:20.239
It's a very beautiful view, yes.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.307
It is.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.908
You know,
when I came back

32:22.941 --> 32:25.311
to America, to Chicago...

32:25.344 --> 32:27.746
I thought that was an ocean.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.815
(chuckles)
My sister said
"No, no, no,

32:29.848 --> 32:31.150
that's a lake."

32:31.183 --> 32:32.418
So she took me to...

32:32.451 --> 32:33.852
to the Sears Tower to show me...

32:33.885 --> 32:36.455
The Willis Tower now.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.524
I remember it takes one minute

32:38.557 --> 32:40.292
to go up 100 floors

32:40.326 --> 32:42.961
so in a certain way
you feel it in your stomach.

32:42.995 --> 32:47.599
So we get off the elevator,
we go to the... (clicks tongue)

32:47.633 --> 32:48.967
the-- how you say,
the-the glass...

32:49.001 --> 32:51.670
The Skydeck.
Yes. The Skydeck.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.606
And I put my head up to it,
I leaned...

32:54.640 --> 32:57.809
and I saw a tiny piece of land.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.278
Michigan.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.014
That was my family's
glass, the Skydeck.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.649
Really?
It's what made

33:03.682 --> 33:05.784
the Chicago Walters
the Chicago Walters--

33:05.817 --> 33:07.386
glass that didn't break.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.521
You wouldn't think
it was such a wonder,

33:09.555 --> 33:11.357
but buildings
like this and...

33:11.390 --> 33:14.226
that, and those,

33:14.260 --> 33:16.662
didn't have windows
like this.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.198
Um... I-I'm sorry.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.668
Why am I here?

33:22.701 --> 33:24.703
I invited you.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.004
And you came.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.873
And I wanted to get
a closer look

33:27.906 --> 33:29.908
at the man who choked
on his own foot

33:29.941 --> 33:31.943
at the planning
commission.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.682
This is for me?

33:36.715 --> 33:38.517
For Saint Anthony's...

33:38.550 --> 33:41.053
and your
not-depleted parish.

33:42.721 --> 33:43.922
(sighs)

33:45.957 --> 33:47.759
Too much...

33:47.793 --> 33:49.528
I... I don't know what to say.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.331
This is...
I write five of those
a week, Father.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.367
If you don't want it, there are
plenty of other places that do.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.502
Forgive me.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.037
Where I was raised...

33:59.071 --> 34:02.908
you give something...
to get something.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.913
It's a bad time for our city.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.916
We don't talk about that
at "Second City First,"

34:10.949 --> 34:12.951
but we know.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.957
(sighs):
I said depleted.

34:18.990 --> 34:21.127
I meant forgotten.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.162
Forsaken.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.932
My husband is dying
a very...

34:26.965 --> 34:30.269
undignified death
down the hall.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.771
I'm really sorry
to hear that.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.209
He loves this city.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.478
He loves the Church.

34:40.946 --> 34:44.116
You caught the Walters
at a sentimental moment.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.923
Do something good with it.

34:51.957 --> 34:54.626
Make me want to
write you another.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.329
* Come, come, come

34:57.363 --> 34:59.498
* Come, come

34:59.531 --> 35:03.235
* Come, come, come

35:03.269 --> 35:04.436
* Come

35:04.470 --> 35:07.072
* Daughter
* Come

35:07.105 --> 35:09.408
* Come, come

35:09.441 --> 35:12.178
* Daughter
* Come

35:12.211 --> 35:14.146
* Come, come, come

35:14.180 --> 35:16.114
* Daughter
* Come

35:16.148 --> 35:18.984
* Come, come, come

35:19.017 --> 35:21.453
* Daughter...

35:21.487 --> 35:22.754
No, no, no.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.791
I'm telling you.
Stay with Kat.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.659
I've got this.

35:27.693 --> 35:28.927
* Come, come

35:28.960 --> 35:30.596
* Daughter
* Come

35:30.629 --> 35:33.332
* Come, come

35:33.365 --> 35:35.801
* Daughter
* Come

35:35.834 --> 35:38.270
* Come, come

35:38.304 --> 35:39.338
* Daughter

35:39.371 --> 35:41.039
* Come, come

35:41.072 --> 35:42.441
* Come

35:42.474 --> 35:44.543
(fading):
* Come, daughter...

35:48.380 --> 35:49.748
(knocking)

35:52.351 --> 35:53.919
Marcus.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.192
Get in the car.

36:03.262 --> 36:06.232
You loved this
afternoon, didn't you?

36:06.265 --> 36:10.135
Bet that made your year.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.571
Do you even care what's
happening to that girl?

36:12.604 --> 36:14.373
It's not my job to care.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.542
Nine victims, Bennett.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.677
Hearts, eyes,
genitals,

36:18.710 --> 36:20.212
hands and feet.

36:20.246 --> 36:23.081
Materials needed to
perform Vocare Pulvere.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.684
It doesn't take nine bodies
to summon forth a demon.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.719
It does if you're
calling more than one.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.089
Can we have some music
back here?

36:31.122 --> 36:34.493
(lively orchestral music
playing)

36:34.526 --> 36:38.063
Yesterday, I saw a man,
a Christian zealot,

36:38.096 --> 36:41.099
immolate outside our hotel.

36:41.132 --> 36:44.670
The police found no accelerant,
no means of ignition.

36:44.703 --> 36:48.006
The fire began
spontaneously.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.277
His Holiness is
a great and good man.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.679
This world would teeter
without him.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.881
He shouldn't be coming here.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.550
Try telling him that, and
he's more determined than ever.

36:58.584 --> 37:01.019
Has the Church
been compromised?

37:01.052 --> 37:02.888
I don't know.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.090
I'm trying to find that out.

37:05.123 --> 37:07.626
(lively orchestral music
continues)

37:09.928 --> 37:13.098
It's a shame you got yourself
kicked out of Chicago.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.468
You have some friends
in this town.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.274
*

37:23.775 --> 37:27.112
BUS DRIVER (over speaker):
...bus to Tallahassee, Florida,

37:27.145 --> 37:28.880
making several stops.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.248
Fist stop--

37:30.282 --> 37:31.617
Elgin.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.158
First stop--

37:40.191 --> 37:42.227
Elgin.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.262
*

37:54.272 --> 37:56.274
You all right there,
kiddo?

37:56.308 --> 37:57.809
I'm fine.

38:00.145 --> 38:02.948
You know, if...

38:02.981 --> 38:04.983
if there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

38:05.016 --> 38:06.818
I said I'm fine.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.356
Because it was...

38:10.389 --> 38:12.824
it was a big night for Kat,

38:12.858 --> 38:14.460
and you sort of...

38:14.493 --> 38:15.494
Oh.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.964
Dad?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.799
You sort of...

38:22.501 --> 38:23.869
Dad?

38:23.902 --> 38:25.804
WOMAN (over speaker):
Next stop, Harold Way.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.639
MAN:
Yeah, baby!
Dad.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.409
(men whooping, shouting)

38:35.981 --> 38:38.183
Nice dress.

38:38.216 --> 38:39.785
I said...

38:39.818 --> 38:41.787
I like your dress.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.288
Thanks.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.492
I'd like it even better
on the floor.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.726
(snickering, whooping)

38:49.495 --> 38:51.497
Hey, hey, hey!
Where you going?

38:51.530 --> 38:53.999
Get off...
Don't act like
I'm some kind of dick.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.534
We're just talking.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.202
I gave you a compliment.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.371
Leave me alone.
Walking around
in a dress like that,

38:59.405 --> 39:00.706
like you don't want
attention?

39:00.739 --> 39:02.007
(laughter, chatter)

39:03.875 --> 39:05.711
Look at that!
I'm just being nice.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.747
Let go.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.883
You want it rough,
all you got to do is ask.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.318
Come on, baby,
you know you want it.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.920
(man whoops)

39:16.588 --> 39:17.656
You do.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.391
You do.

39:19.425 --> 39:21.092
(men laughing, whooping)

39:21.126 --> 39:23.529
(indistinct whispering)

39:29.300 --> 39:31.302
*

39:51.890 --> 39:53.892
*

40:15.581 --> 40:17.583
*

40:34.800 --> 40:36.635
Come on, what's your name?
Hey...

40:36.668 --> 40:37.703
Hey!

40:39.638 --> 40:42.307
(gasps)

40:42.340 --> 40:44.442
(people gasping)

40:52.518 --> 40:53.619
Hey!

40:56.354 --> 40:58.990
(others gasping)

41:02.628 --> 41:03.895
(man grunts)

41:05.664 --> 41:06.965
Casey?

41:06.998 --> 41:09.000
(coughing)

41:10.368 --> 41:11.369
(grunts)

41:14.540 --> 41:16.141
(demonic voice):
Do you want it rough?

41:16.174 --> 41:18.309
All you got to do is ask.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.646
(women screaming)

41:20.679 --> 41:22.914
(screaming continues)

41:25.651 --> 41:26.618
Casey?

41:26.652 --> 41:27.986
(yelling)

41:33.158 --> 41:34.259
Casey?

41:36.862 --> 41:39.364
(muffled screaming)

41:45.070 --> 41:46.137
(neck snaps)

41:46.171 --> 41:47.739
HENRY:
Casey!

41:47.773 --> 41:49.775
(others quiet)
(electrical buzzing)

41:56.582 --> 41:58.584
(woman sobbing)

42:00.451 --> 42:02.453
(liquid running, splashing)

42:06.057 --> 42:08.059
(music box music playing)
