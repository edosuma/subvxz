00:02.440 --> 00:03.668
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Daddy!

00:03.840 --> 00:06.070
Her dad beat up
my dad at my debutante ball. 

00:06.520 --> 00:07.669
You can't blame Holly for that.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.955
- I know Jimmy.
- I've heard.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.951
He still has your prom photo on our wall.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.678
- What do you want from me?
- I want a divorce.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.751
I never should have broken up
with you in the first place.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.309
- I don't know what I should do.
- Let me know when you decide.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.358
You chose Luke, huh?
Chino didn't stand a chance.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.278
Let's go.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.469
You're too late.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.269
- The plan is undeniable.
- I'm denying it.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.112
We have my mom's Range Rover.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.556
We have a perfect alibi, as I go to
this comic-book convention every year.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.915
We have my entire life
of never doing anything wrong...

00:43.080 --> 00:45.275
...which lulls my parents
into a false sense of trust.

00:45.440 --> 00:49.752
And you wanna throw all that away for
Summer in a wet T-shirt doing body shots?

00:51.040 --> 00:53.634
I'm sorry. I thought that was
a rhetorical question. Yes...

00:53.800 --> 00:57.270
...Ryan, yes. On the last weekend
before school, one goes to Tijuana.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.749
It is tradition,
and it is a rite of passage.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.115
What happens in Mexico
stays in Mexico.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.913
What happens in Mexico?

01:04.080 --> 01:06.594
I don't know. It stays there.
That's why we must go.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.191
I don't know about lying
to your parents.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.271
I can respect that. I will lie to them.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.471
Why can't we just go to Comicon?

01:14.640 --> 01:16.471
Comicon is a bunch
of pathetic virgins...

01:16.640 --> 01:18.710
...ogling some porn star dressed
as Catwoman.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.836
I thought you went every year.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.277
Listen. Tijuana's a big town.
I'm sure you won't even see Marissa.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.398
I don't care about seeing Marissa
or not seeing Marissa.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.472
Therefore, you should have
no problem coming to Mexico, right?

01:31.640 --> 01:33.631
Well, won't she be hanging out
with Summer?

01:33.800 --> 01:35.711
No, she'll probably be
shacked up with Luke.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.395
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was probably a bit painful.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.028
Hey, fellas.
You all excited about Comicon?

01:42.200 --> 01:45.829
Seth's been going since he was 10.
It's the highlight of his year.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.594
Thanks. "Highlight" is a bit overstating it.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.992
- Check you out. Big pimping.
- I got a meeting with a private law firm.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.594
- You suing one of their clients?
- It's a job interview.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.389
Which he'll never take. They like to
flatter him every once in a while.

01:59.560 --> 02:03.917
- Yeah, I go for the free meal.
- But you'll still be a public defender, right?

02:04.080 --> 02:07.072
After 15 years?
There's no way he's selling out.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.356
Well, it'd have to be
one hell of a free meal.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.988
And that's what's they call
a "callback" in comedy.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.549
So how soon until you two
are leaving on your trip?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.392
I don't know. How soon?

02:19.720 --> 02:21.039
Tomorrow.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.676
Don't you mean "<i>ma Íana</i>"?

03:01.280 --> 03:03.714
- Looks good.
- I don't wear hats.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.718
Ryan, you mean "sombrero."

03:06.880 --> 03:10.236
Brush up on your Spanish.
There's over 500 useful phrases.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.238
"May I please see a ladies' worsted
nylon bathing suit?"

03:17.400 --> 03:19.630
Yeah. Well, did you know that one?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.678
- What's this?
- An itinerary for our trip.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.070
Seth, it's 12 pages long.
We're going for two days.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.674
If you're gonna get over Marissa,
you need activities.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.513
I don't need to get over Marissa.
I'm over Marissa.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.239
Ryan. Ryan.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.995
Look at me.
Look, this is me here, okay? Amigo.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.835
Now, I know you're hurting, and I think
you need to unburden your soul.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.278
- Any time. I'm here to help.
- My soul is fine. Marissa and me...

03:49.440 --> 03:52.750
It just... I don't know.
It never would have worked.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.354
No kidding.
It is so much better this way.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.512
He's all, like, brooding, wounded,
"Somebody save me."

03:58.680 --> 04:02.036
- I thought you liked that.
- It is too hot to save anyone.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.273
Speaking of hot, I can't believe
you and Luke. You guys did it.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.954
Tell me everything.
I've been waiting for this forever.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.599
- You have?
- You've seen it before.

04:10.760 --> 04:11.795
- Come on!
- Touched it?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.713
Summer! It's a sacred act
between two people.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.430
It was a letdown, right?
Kind of hurt? Totally awkward?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.750
I don't have anything to compare it to.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.037
So do it again.
It is way better the second time.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.430
I'm supposed to go to his place
this afternoon.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.353
Trust me, Coop.
Get back on that horse.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.877
- You gotta giddyup!
- My dad's home!

04:34.040 --> 04:37.396
I don't understand. You promised me
the apartment would be ready tomorrow.

04:37.560 --> 04:42.076
Yeah, I'm moving out this weekend.
Where am I supposed to stay?

04:44.280 --> 04:47.909
Yeah, well, you don't have to apologize.
I just...

04:48.080 --> 04:51.595
You know what? Thank you.
Forget it. Yeah. Bye.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.110
- Dad?
- Hey. Hi, girls.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.236
Hey. So Summer and I are gonna go...

04:58.400 --> 05:01.198
Oh, right. You're going to
Palm Springs, yeah.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.272
We're not leaving until tomorrow.
For Tijuana?

05:04.440 --> 05:08.035
Oh, right, yeah.
Yeah, I meant... Yeah.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.428
Are you okay?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.273
Because, I mean,
I was gonna go over to Luke's.

05:12.440 --> 05:16.638
- But if you want, I could stay here.
- No, I'm fine, sweetie. Go to Luke's.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.830
Luke's great. Isn't he, Summer?
He's... He's a good kid.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.354
Sure.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.990
Anyway, l... I gotta... You know...

05:28.160 --> 05:29.957
Right. I know. Yeah.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.392
Okay.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.512
All right. Bye.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.477
- See you.
- See you.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.839
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.309
Is now a bad time?

05:51.160 --> 05:54.152
I don't know why you didn't come
to me in the first place.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.313
I'll call my realtor, Gloria. I'm sure
she'll be able to help you find something.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.596
Thanks. Yeah, really, thank you.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.638
So how'd the girls take the news?

06:05.720 --> 06:11.078
Well, Julie and I decided to table
that conversation until Monday.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.753
You haven't told them yet?

06:12.920 --> 06:16.754
Well, Julie's at her mom's with Kaitlin and
Marissa's going to Mexico this weekend.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.356
We just thought it'd be easier
and cleaner if we did it that way.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.513
They come back,
I'm gone, and then we tell them.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.716
I'm not so sure about this.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.395
Well, neither am I...

06:30.560 --> 06:35.839
...but the thought of having them
watch me move out...

06:37.600 --> 06:39.750
It's hard enough as it is.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.032
I never thought I'd be that guy that...

06:46.400 --> 06:48.311
The divorced guy.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.228
I can't wait to go to Tijuana.
It's gonna be so romantic.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.550
It's kind of gross there.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.473
So what?
We won't leave the hotel room.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.877
I don't know.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.390
It'll be way better the second time.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.791
No, I mean, I don't know about Mexico.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.359
TJ.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.631
I don't think I'm gonna go.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.268
I feel like my dad's having a meltdown.

07:39.240 --> 07:43.199
You're thinking about your dad
right now? Come on, babe.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.753
I don't know if I can leave him alone.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.355
Marissa, he's, like, 40.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.637
Look, we can go to Mexico whenever.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.712
I feel like I should be with him
right now.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.718
Okay, fine.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.950
I gotta go meet the guys anyway.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.719
Is she looking at me?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.952
- Still not.
- You know what she's doing?

08:21.120 --> 08:22.473
And it's textbook.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.473
She's playing me hot and cold,
pretending our kiss didn't happen.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.029
There were no witnesses.
I didn't see anything.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.317
Then maybe I'll just have to make
magic happen again, won't I?

08:36.159 --> 08:37.592
Hey.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.270
How you been?
I haven't seen you in a while.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.796
Yeah, well, the last time I saw you,
you kind of had your hands full.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.874
Coop! Come on.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.832
- Well, don't let me keep you.
- I won't.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.592
- Okay. Later.
- Fine.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.112
- Hey, Coop.
- Hey, Holl.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.909
You don't make those freshmen
watch a real donkey show, do you?

09:08.040 --> 09:11.271
Sandy Cohen.
How'd you get past security?

09:11.440 --> 09:13.158
- How are you, Rachel?
- Hi.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.830
You look great. Being a slave
to the Man agrees with you.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.356
Six seconds until the first insult.
You're getting soft. Still surfing?

09:24.520 --> 09:28.399
Every morning. Keeps my mind clear.
That and not working in a joint like this.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.393
Yeah. Decent hours,
appropriate compensation.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.835
I don't know how I ever left
the DA's office.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.629
It's because you kept losing
to this roguish, brilliant...

09:37.800 --> 09:41.110
- Conceited.
- That's right, it was me.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.670
What do the good folks at Partridge,
Savage and Kahn want with a lowly PD?

09:44.840 --> 09:47.752
I gotta tell you, you made some noise
with that Jimmy Cooper case.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.356
- I didn't do anything.
- You have your work cut out for you.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.910
But heading the feds off at the pass,
negotiating a restitution deal...

09:55.080 --> 09:58.356
...calling in a high-powered securities
attorney in the span of a weekend.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.034
- God, I am impressive.
- And conceited.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.519
So you keep saying.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.148
Truth be told,
no one was gonna touch that guy.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.676
The fact that you did made
the partners think, made me think.

10:08.840 --> 10:12.196
"Is Sandy Cohen really ready
to come down off his high horse?

10:12.360 --> 10:14.191
Is he finally tired of being a martyr?"

10:14.360 --> 10:16.351
Jeez, I was just hoping for a free meal.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.115
Sorry to disappoint you. All you're
getting is a really good sales pitch.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.157
Sounds delicious.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.194
What are you...?

10:29.640 --> 10:33.315
Eavesdropping, Ryan.
I hear like a wolf.

10:33.480 --> 10:37.268
- What do you mean, you're not going?
- I just... I don't know, Summ. I can't.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.392
But how am I supposed to get there?

10:39.560 --> 10:42.358
The guys are going tonight
for that stupid freshman hazing.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.829
- Holly's car is full.
- I'm sorry.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.719
I'm totally stranded.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.440
What happens in Mexico
stays in Mexico.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.752
Holly, I can't. Me and Marissa,
we're back together.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.396
I give it a week. You'll miss me.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.479
Come on, babe. Let's get you
out of here before the road trip starts.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.036
I don't know. Whatever.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.591
Hello, Summer. Seth Cohen.
I believe you remember.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.158
Nothing?
I heard you needed a ride tomorrow.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.954
- You have all our numbers.
- Dad, I know our phone number.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.237
Did you bring enough water?
Extra batteries?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.391
Air in the tires? Gas in the tank?

11:43.560 --> 11:45.835
It's amazing I turned out so normal.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.513
Hey. Let me get that.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.833
Hey, Summer. Sandy Cohen.
I'm Seth's dad.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.956
I had no idea you were
into comic books.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.712
Comic books?

11:59.880 --> 12:02.269
- She goes for the anime.
- Anime.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.318
I'm gonna go say bye to Coop.
Don't touch my stuff.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.438
This is gonna be awesome.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.953
She is hot stuff, son.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.156
And now it's ruined.

12:13.320 --> 12:17.029
- I told you, I can't go.
- I got us a ride. Just grab some stuff.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.033
Hey. What are you guys
still doing here?

12:20.200 --> 12:21.838
I thought I'd stay home this weekend.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.639
What? Why? I thought you were
looking forward to this trip.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.872
I was. But I thought maybe
we could spend some time together.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.600
Well, we can't, I'm sorry.

12:30.760 --> 12:34.389
I thought you were going,
so I made other plans.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.673
I was. I just...

12:37.840 --> 12:39.432
I mean, are you sure?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.158
- Because I thought maybe we could...
- Look, Marissa, please.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.959
Come on.
I can't take care of both of us.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.473
Okay. I'll go pack my stuff.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.839
Coop?

12:57.320 --> 12:59.709
- So who's going with us?
- You'll see.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.515
Great news. I got Coop to come along.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.952
We're going to TJ!

13:25.160 --> 13:27.879
I can't believe you convinced me
to do this.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.191
- You could've brought somebody in.
- Where's the fun in that?

13:31.360 --> 13:34.272
It only took us a couple of hours
to paint my dorm room, remember?

13:34.440 --> 13:36.795
Your dorm room was the size
of a prison cell.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.952
Well, we may be painting
one of those as well.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.348
Sorry.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.397
Listen, thank you so much.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.235
The thought of being home
when Julie and the kids come back...

13:47.400 --> 13:49.960
- You haven't told them yet.
- Well, not exactly.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.716
I mean, I was gonna tell Marissa,
but then it just seemed impossibly hard.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.792
Because it is.
Jimmy, Marissa's not a little girl anymore.

13:57.960 --> 14:02.192
And if she comes home and finds
you gone, she'll never forgive you.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.356
Call her.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.592
She'll still love you. I promise.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.032
We should be there in three hours.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.156
The GPS says the ETA's
three and a half.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.153
Well, that's because someone drives
like an old woman.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.072
I'm going 70 in a 65 zone.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.639
Eighty is the new 70.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.836
What? Who talks like that?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.798
Who gets passed by a van full of nuns?

14:29.960 --> 14:31.393
Oh, wait, Cohen does.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.279
They have God on their side.
I'm not gonna beat Jesus.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.590
I'm gonna call Holly
and see how far ahead she is.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.593
- And she's a girl.
- That's insulting to your own gender.

14:39.760 --> 14:43.275
- Not as insulting as it is to you.
- Point taken.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.559
No, thanks.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.633
I'll take it.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.358
I'm so dehydrated.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.479
What is up with the a.c.? My hair
is frizzing out. I look like Howard Stern.

14:55.640 --> 15:00.236
- My Jewfro benefits from this climate.
- You're Jewish?

15:00.840 --> 15:03.593
Yes. That's why I feel so comfortable
in this desert heat.

15:03.760 --> 15:07.958
This is a nightmare. I'm sweating
to death, driving 10 miles an hour...

15:08.120 --> 15:10.429
...in, like, a rickshaw,
listening to this music.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.671
Hey, do not insult Death Cab.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.229
It's, like, one guitar
and a whole lot of complaining.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.392
Reminds me of someone else
who's doing a lot of complaining. You.

15:18.560 --> 15:23.076
I'm driving this vehicle, and I'll drive
at the speed that I feel comfortable, okay?

15:23.240 --> 15:24.832
It's my music, it is my snacks...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.911
Kudos and Goldfish? What are you, 8?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.316
- Say goodbye to Summer.
- What are you doing?

15:29.480 --> 15:32.199
Leaving you at the side of the road.
Don't touch the wheel!

15:32.360 --> 15:34.920
Stop! Stop it!

15:35.080 --> 15:37.469
- Guys, stop it!
- Seth!

15:52.120 --> 15:54.111
It's not exactly the honeymoon suite.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.919
Well, it's only for one night,
until the axle's fixed.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.152
- I've stayed in worse.
- That's nothing to brag about.

16:00.320 --> 16:04.677
Sweet!
Do we have to pay extra for the pubes?

16:04.840 --> 16:09.072
- This is so gross. I cannot stay here.
- Unless you feel like hitchhiking again...

16:09.240 --> 16:12.516
No, thank you. I've spent
enough time in a truck full of chickens.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.318
Hey, we're lucky that guy stopped.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.677
We'd be even luckier if Cole Trickle here
hadn't driven us off the road.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.991
- Who the hell is Cole Trickle?
- Tom Cruise. <i>Days of Thunder</i>.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.752
Guys, can we try to be positive?

16:22.920 --> 16:24.876
Okay. I am positive this is Summer's fault.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.110
I'm positive that I'm leaving
here with a rash.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.272
Oh, so you plan on making
some extra money tonight.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.435
This bathroom is so...

16:41.040 --> 16:43.474
- Hello.
- Hey.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.598
Hey, what happened to you?
You're finger-painting in the back yard?

16:46.760 --> 16:49.194
I was helping Jimmy
paint his new living room.

16:49.360 --> 16:53.433
- Julie kicked him out?
- Is that okay that I'm helping him?

16:53.600 --> 16:56.194
Yeah, I guess, with everything
he's been going through.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.749
Honey! You shouldn't have!

16:58.920 --> 17:02.549
I didn't. It washed up
about an hour ago. Who's Rachel?

17:02.720 --> 17:04.517
She works at the law firm I met with.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.114
Well, the meeting must have gone well.
You never said.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.236
You must have let them down easy.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.949
In a private practice, I could do more
pro bono work than I do now.

17:13.119 --> 17:17.477
Sandy, you're not seriously considering
taking this job, are you?

17:17.640 --> 17:20.029
The salary they offered me
is outrageous.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.751
You've never been swayed by a paycheck.
This family has all the money it needs.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.114
Except it's your money.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.872
- It's our money.
- Not really.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.634
Unless you wanna buy the Lakers
or a Caribbean island.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.473
It's not about buying stuff,
although Aruba would be nice.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.473
It's about contributing.
And I have an opportunity here.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.196
Yeah, to work for people
that you hate.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.759
You refer to those places as...

17:40.920 --> 17:44.151
...evil empires controlled by
corporate interests, owned by the Man.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.551
Well, I tend to be hyperbolic.
It goes with the territory.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.676
The PD office is your life.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.037
I don't want you to give that up
so you can buy groceries the next week.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.317
Don't belittle this.
I think balance is important.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.596
- We don't have balance?
- No, you have all the money.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.228
And you have all the ideals.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.755
- You like that I don't make a lot of money.
- What?

18:03.920 --> 18:08.072
It makes us different from all these
other families. All these other women...

18:08.240 --> 18:11.277
...married to their investment bankers
and their CEOs.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.954
As long as I haven't sold out,
you haven't sold out.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.917
- That's not true.
- Come on, face it.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.153
The only thing that keeps you
from feeling like Julie Cooper is me.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.393
But, hey, it's just an offer.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.037
I have to pick wisely.
Ding Dongs or Cheese Sticks?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.031
I don't care. Pick whatever.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.510
- I don't care either.
- So I guess we'll just starve.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.073
- You ever gonna stop being mad at me?
- I'm not mad at you.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.798
Right.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.031
- Why would I be mad at you?
- You walked in on me with another girl.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.510
Actually, I think she was a woman.
But why would I care about that?

18:52.680 --> 18:56.150
- I don't know. Shouldn't be a problem.
- There's no problem.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.754
Except Ding Dongs or Cheese Sticks.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.509
I don't care, Ryan.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.717
I don't care about Cheese Sticks
and I don't care about Ding Dongs.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.714
And I really don't care that I walked
in on you with some girl. Or woman.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.632
Whatever.

19:11.720 --> 19:15.110
I was only with her because
you were clearly back with Luke.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.872
I was not back with Luke.

19:18.760 --> 19:19.988
You are now, right?

19:20.840 --> 19:22.990
- Right.
- Okay.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.755
Great. So we'll just get to Mexico,
split up and never talk again.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.831
Sounds like a plan.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.831
By the way,
you could have knocked first.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.872
Did you ever wonder why
I came to the pool house to find you?

19:37.480 --> 19:38.799
Every day.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.192
Here's your chance.
Clear the air. Tell me.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.393
Cheese Sticks. I hate Ding Dongs.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.232
Hey. Static.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.958
That's awesome.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.311
What are you doing?

20:08.480 --> 20:12.996
Almost watching TV. This is either
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> or <i>JAG</i>.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.071
Get off the bed.
The sooner I go to sleep...

20:15.240 --> 20:18.755
...the sooner it'll be morning
and this nightmare will be over.

20:19.480 --> 20:23.359
I'm not sleeping on that couch. It's
stained and smells foul. You sleep there.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.909
After you've made it sound
so appealing? Good night.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.752
- Come on, get off the bed!
- Nope.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.878
- Be, like, a gentleman.
- Chivalry's dead, sugar.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.110
You make a move,
I rip out your jugular.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.999
Oh, hey, pillow talk.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.754
Hello?

21:10.920 --> 21:12.831
Oh, hey, Dad.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.197
Hey, you got a minute, kiddo?

21:15.360 --> 21:18.511
Yeah. Is everything okay?

21:18.680 --> 21:20.750
<i>Well, no.</i>

21:20.920 --> 21:23.229
<i>Not exactly.</i>

21:26.480 --> 21:28.038
What is it?

21:29.640 --> 21:32.996
<i>This isn 't a very easy thing to say.</i>

21:34.320 --> 21:39.075
When you get home,
I'm not gonna be there.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.632
<i>Your mom and I are...</i>

21:41.800 --> 21:43.392
You're getting a divorce.

21:43.960 --> 21:47.396
I just can't believe you're telling me this
over the phone.

21:49.160 --> 21:54.393
I was gonna tell you before you left,
but then I knew you'd stay.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.670
<i>And I just couldn 't let you</i>
<i>watch me pack up my life.</i>

22:02.800 --> 22:06.156
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, kiddo.

22:08.840 --> 22:12.196
<i>I don 't wanna ruin your whole trip.</i>
<i>It's good that you went.</i>

22:29.480 --> 22:30.913
I can sleep on the floor.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.473
No, it's okay.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.914
I'm sorry.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.033
Thanks.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.431
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.079
I know.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.512
You wanna go home?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.672
I just...

24:44.600 --> 24:46.670
I think I wanna stay here.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.230
I'm gonna go take a shower.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.478
So...

25:23.640 --> 25:25.710
...Tijuana.
- Yeah.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.792
Should we have woke Ryan
and Marissa?

25:27.960 --> 25:31.111
No. They looked so cute together.
Vomit.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.033
Hey. That's a real sentimental streak
you got there, Summer.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.555
It's too early for your so-called comedy.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.199
You enjoy my comedy.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.233
You know what else I think you enjoy?
Me.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.277
That's because you're mentally unstable.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.715
Be that as it may,
the facts speak for themselves.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.269
Might I remind you of something
that I call...

25:50.440 --> 25:53.477
..."the time that you kissed me
at my grandfather's party."

25:53.640 --> 25:55.232
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.119
I know that denial is a very powerful
coping mechanism...

25:58.280 --> 26:01.272
...but it's time we paid lip service
to our lip service.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.432
Two words: No tongue.

26:04.600 --> 26:08.593
- You agreed to take this trip with me.
- I needed a ride.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.113
We shared the same bed.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.475
I wasn't sleeping on that couch.
It smelled like eggs.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.677
- You ate my toast, Summer.
- I like crusts, Seth.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.354
Face it. Our chemistry is undeniable.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.069
- You know what else is undeniable?
- What?

26:21.240 --> 26:25.119
The pain this fork is gonna cause
when I jam it into your eye.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.436
I suffer from rage blackouts.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.110
I'm gonna get the check.

26:35.480 --> 26:36.629
Where's Coop?

26:36.800 --> 26:39.234
- The shower.
- Hope she's wearing shower shoes.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.631
Here's breakfast, and the chariot's
repaired and out front. Ready to go?

26:42.800 --> 26:45.030
- I'm not sure we're going.
- What?

26:47.240 --> 26:50.152
Marissa's dad called
with some bad news.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.991
What's going on?

26:56.280 --> 26:59.192
They're getting divorced.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.954
Baby, I'm so sorry.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.433
Whatever you wanna do, Coop.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.160
But if I may,
speaking as a child of divorce...

27:09.320 --> 27:11.311
...you do not wanna be home
right now.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.711
And this is our last chance for freedom.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.394
We get back to Newport,
and it's school and reality.

27:16.560 --> 27:20.917
Let's go to TJ, have fun.
Life will suck soon enough.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.600
She might actually be right.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.035
Well, there's a first time for everything.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.516
Rage blackouts, got it. I'll be in the car.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.318
Let's go to TJ.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.157
I still don't understand
why we needed to get two rooms.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.550
I'll leave you my key
just in case you get Ionely.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.678
Or in case I wanna smother you
with your pillow.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.559
- Whatever turns you on.
- Everyone's at Boom-Boom.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.996
I have to go to the pharmacy. You can
get anything without a prescription.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.957
I need to make a pit stop
for my stepmom.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.953
She's taken all the painkillers
available in Orange County.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.829
I should probably pop in and pick up
an antihistamine. Allergies.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.913
You don't have to come with us
if you don't want.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.911
I'm going to find Luke.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.908
It's okay. Really. That's fine.

28:30.680 --> 28:34.912
Hey, where are the partners? Oh, right,
I forgot. Vampires hate the sunlight.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.117
- They didn't want to appear desperate.
- So they sent you.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.114
- Desperation's your strong suit.
- And yours is...

28:42.280 --> 28:44.840
I'm drawing a blank here.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.675
They're pulling the offer first thing in
the morning unless they hear from you.

28:48.840 --> 28:52.549
Thank them for the surfboard,
although it did freak my wife out.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.075
You had her believing
I was considering this job.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.117
- Which you are.
- No.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.989
As much as I'd like to think you're here
for the sparkling banter and crab cakes...

29:01.160 --> 29:02.388
...I know you're interested.

29:02.560 --> 29:07.190
It's not gonna happen. I've been in the
PD's office my whole life. It's what I do.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.430
And I'm giving you
a platform to do it better.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.192
The sand dabs are great here.

29:11.360 --> 29:14.033
Don't you wanna see what
would happen if you tested yourself?

29:14.200 --> 29:16.873
Not just against one more overworked,
underpaid ADA.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.792
I always loved beating you.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.996
- You know why?
- Why?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.673
Because I was excellent.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.317
Which is why I left.
I wanted to do more.

29:27.480 --> 29:28.799
And so do you.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.632
The clock's ticking.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.799
Sand dabs, huh?

29:34.960 --> 29:36.279
Yep.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.278
Of course she would be.
But telling her...

29:40.440 --> 29:42.032
You were totally right.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.679
It'll take a while.

29:43.840 --> 29:47.594
It's gonna take us all
a while to get used to this.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.320
My swinging new bachelor pad.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.352
You know, this is the first time
I've ever really been a bachelor.

29:55.520 --> 30:00.435
I mean, I went from you to Julie,
and the rest is...

30:02.760 --> 30:04.591
Let me ask you something.

30:04.760 --> 30:10.039
You ever have any doubts
about you and Sandy?

30:10.200 --> 30:12.111
We have our issues.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.114
You ever think what it would be like
if you and I had ended up...?

30:18.520 --> 30:19.873
Sometimes.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.753
Finished.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.557
I should go.

30:44.720 --> 30:48.190
Yeah, I'm sorry, that was totally...
That was wrong of me.

30:48.360 --> 30:52.114
My marriage is falling apart,
but I shouldn't try to bring yours down.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.238
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay. I'm sorry. L...

31:35.240 --> 31:39.916
- Come on, Luke. Back that ass up.
- No, that's cool.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.954
Marissa's not even coming.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.271
Come on. I love this song.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.149
I love authentic Mexican culture.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.914
- What are you doing?
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.638
What, that you got caught?

33:16.800 --> 33:20.349
- Don't ever talk to me again.
- You are such a bitch.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.080
- Please. He hooks up with everyone.
- Shut up.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.755
Freshman girls,
girls from Mater Dei, girls from UCI.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.433
Is that true?

33:29.080 --> 33:33.358
Marissa, everyone knows. Everyone!
Now you do too.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.554
- You are so mean.
- Summer, I am honest.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.072
Her parents are getting divorced,
you stupid slut!

33:40.240 --> 33:43.312
Walk away, Holly.
She suffers from rage blackouts.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.073
- Let her go.
- This isn't about you.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.912
- It is now.
- Get out of my way.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.752
You don't deserve her.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.919
- I'll go check the hotel.
- I'll check the streets.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.798
Call me if you find her.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.989
Thank God, Coop.

34:26.239 --> 34:29.038
I slept with him.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.952
I know, sweetie.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.158
- I gotta call Ryan and Seth.
- No. I don't wanna see them.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.911
Just...

34:40.080 --> 34:41.911
I'm so embarrassed.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.119
It's okay. It's just...
We'll go home.

34:47.239 --> 34:50.630
I can't go home. My dad will be gone.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.996
My mom's gonna be back. I have...

34:55.080 --> 34:56.831
I have no one.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.909
Come on, Coop. Let's get out of here.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.990
I'll grab our stuff.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.074
Hey, it's me.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.673
Hey.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.876
- I found her.
- You did?

35:33.040 --> 35:34.519
She's at the hotel.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.557
- <i>You guys need to get here fast.</i>
- Okay.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.278
Okay.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.192
Hey, Coop.
You wanna get some dinner?

35:43.360 --> 35:45.237
What are you in the mood for?

35:46.480 --> 35:48.118
Coop?

35:49.400 --> 35:50.594
Coop.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.519
Okay.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.477
- Bad news. She's gone.
- What?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.598
And so are my stepmom's painkillers.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.676
- Should we split up?
- No, let's stick together. Come on.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.313
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.359
How'd it go with the suits?

37:15.520 --> 37:17.317
You know, okay.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.552
I can't believe summer's over.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.312
I know.

37:23.480 --> 37:26.836
Feels like it goes faster and faster
every year.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.033
So if I did take this job...

37:31.200 --> 37:33.794
You've already taken it.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.673
Haven't you?

37:35.840 --> 37:38.638
I can still get out of it if you want me to.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.671
To a new season.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.039
Coop!

39:04.360 --> 39:06.032
Coop!

40:24.560 --> 40:26.152
Hey, honey, come on.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.632
Wake up.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.552
Wake up.
