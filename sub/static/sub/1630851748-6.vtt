[gasps, grunts]

00:23.583 --> 00:26.666
[coughs, groans]

00:26.750 --> 00:29.333
[coughing, sighs]

00:29.416 --> 00:31.833
I just don't understand
where all those logs came from.

00:31.916 --> 00:34.416
-[chittering]
-[sighs] You're safe now, little loris.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.625
-[screeches]
-Ow!

00:36.208 --> 00:37.250
Sorry about the logs!

00:37.333 --> 00:38.750
[hissing]

00:39.833 --> 00:42.500
[grunts] Well, this sucks.

00:42.583 --> 00:45.291
Am I the only one who made it out alive?
Uncle Bradley!

00:45.875 --> 00:48.416
[groans] I'm here, Bonnie. We're all good.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.833
Uh, your nose looks
like a half-chewed blood sausage.

00:51.916 --> 00:54.125
Ah. I got bitten by the loris.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.541
You wouldn't think
a tiny primate would be venomous,

00:56.625 --> 00:58.625
but looks can be deceiving.

00:59.666 --> 01:01.208
[screams in pain, sighs]

01:01.291 --> 01:03.041
Ew. [gasps] Where's Dietrich?

01:03.125 --> 01:04.375
After the boat was crushed,

01:04.458 --> 01:07.958
<i>I saw him being tossed around the rapids</i>
<i>like a sack of chicken heads.</i>

01:08.041 --> 01:09.916
Let's assume he's dead.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.583
It's just easier that way.

01:11.666 --> 01:12.916
[gasps] What?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.291
[sighs, grunts]

01:14.375 --> 01:15.625
Yellow-throated marten!

01:15.708 --> 01:17.916
Aw, he's such a cutie!

01:18.000 --> 01:21.250
Uh-uh. Don't be fooled
by his adorable whiskers.

01:21.333 --> 01:24.000
Martens are vicious predators.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.541
They'll kill monkeys, deer,

01:25.625 --> 01:28.041
they'll even disembowel a giant panda.

01:28.125 --> 01:31.125
[Bonnie] Come on!
Look at that wiggly wittle nose!

01:31.208 --> 01:33.375
You wouldn't hurt anybody,
would you, little sweetie?

01:33.458 --> 01:34.416
[groaning]

01:34.500 --> 01:36.375
-[Bonnie] Uncle B!
-Aah! Ow! [yelping]

01:36.458 --> 01:38.625
-[screams]
-[grunting]

01:38.708 --> 01:40.125
-Take that!
-Not helping!

01:40.208 --> 01:41.875
-[Bonnie] Hah!
-This feels wrong.

01:41.958 --> 01:44.833
-[snarls]
-Martens usually hunt in pairs. [screams]

01:44.916 --> 01:46.958
-Holy crap! [grunts]
-[grunts, groans]

01:49.416 --> 01:52.250
-[siren blaring]
-[groaning]

01:52.333 --> 01:53.750
What is happening?

01:54.250 --> 01:55.708
[siren continues]

01:56.500 --> 01:57.333
[siren stops]

01:57.416 --> 01:59.250
Agh! It can't be.

01:59.333 --> 02:00.458
Daniel?

02:00.541 --> 02:01.541
[chuckling] What?

02:01.625 --> 02:04.791
Is that the great
Bradley Trevor Greive I see

02:04.875 --> 02:07.791
bleeding out
from a completely avoidable marten bite?

02:07.875 --> 02:11.083
I hardly recognized you
in your cute little costume.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.291
They're not costumes,

02:12.375 --> 02:14.500
they're zoological proximity disguises,

02:14.583 --> 02:18.208
and this technique has been used
by Greive zoologists for generations.

02:18.291 --> 02:22.125
I'm kidding, big fella! Ha-ha!
Oh, it's good to see you again.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.000
-What's that thing?
-Oh, this?

02:24.083 --> 02:27.666
Just a little something I cooked up
back in my lab to scare off wild animals.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.041
I call it a Sonic Grenade.

02:30.125 --> 02:31.500
Whoa! Cool tech.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.791
Those gizmos have no place in nature.

02:33.875 --> 02:36.000
Who knows
what kind of damage they could do

02:36.083 --> 02:37.875
to an animal's auditory cortex?

02:37.958 --> 02:38.875
Aah!

02:38.958 --> 02:40.958
[gasps]

02:41.041 --> 02:43.083
-Dietrich's not dead!
-Give it time.

02:43.166 --> 02:44.875
Danny Wilde, I presume?

02:44.958 --> 02:46.083
[clears throat]

02:46.166 --> 02:47.625
Presumably. [chuckles]

02:47.708 --> 02:49.666
Danny Wilde?

02:49.750 --> 02:52.583
Oh, you didn't know?
I go by Danny Wilde now.

02:52.666 --> 02:53.958
I'm kind of a big deal.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.125
Over three and a half million followers,

02:56.208 --> 02:58.166
several late-night TV appearances,

02:58.250 --> 03:01.708
and a line of clothing
I call Wilde Wear. [growls]

03:01.791 --> 03:04.125
Oh my God! Oh my God! [clears throat]

03:04.208 --> 03:07.625
My mom and I used to watch your show
while we were taking our bath.

03:07.708 --> 03:09.208
It's such a pleasant surprise!

03:09.291 --> 03:10.541
Yes, it is, friend.

03:10.625 --> 03:14.791
Danny Wilde out in Prey-desh
in search of a Bengal tiger.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.708
Mmm, it's Pradesh.

03:16.791 --> 03:18.125
Be cool. Be cool.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.666
[clears throat] Would you
autograph my birthmark?

03:20.750 --> 03:22.416
'Cause it looks like your cool logo.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.041
Mmm, that would be disgusting,
and I'd hate that.

03:25.125 --> 03:29.333
So, uh, what brings a bookish bruiser
like you to Tiger Country?

03:29.416 --> 03:33.333
We're looking to tag a gnu goat,
aka the takin, but we got side--

03:33.416 --> 03:34.416
Goats? Wow.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.875
How do your readers endure
the tension and suspense?

03:37.958 --> 03:40.333
The gnu goat
is the most hyper-aggressive heavyweight

03:40.416 --> 03:41.583
in the Himalayas!

03:41.666 --> 03:42.875
He's not just a goat.

03:42.958 --> 03:44.708
[echoing] He's goat-zilla!

03:44.791 --> 03:46.833
King of the mountain!

03:46.916 --> 03:49.875
I'd argue the Bengal tiger
is king of the mountain,

03:49.958 --> 03:51.833
but I understand.

03:51.916 --> 03:54.708
You always did have a soft spot
for the, uh…

03:54.791 --> 03:56.500
How can I say this? [chuckles]

03:56.583 --> 03:59.458
…more underrepresented animals
of the world.

03:59.541 --> 04:02.833
Well, it was a fun surprise
running into you, Daniel.

04:02.916 --> 04:04.791
Like stepping on a rusty nail
in the shower.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.166
-[yelps]
-Alas, we must be going.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.250
Hey, if you ever feel like brunch,
I make a killer frittata.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.250
[animal growling]

04:12.333 --> 04:15.750
-[screeching]
-[howling]

04:16.916 --> 04:18.958
[BTG laughing] Those stupid widgets.

04:19.041 --> 04:22.833
I mean, who wears
a sleeveless puffer jacket in the jungle?

04:22.916 --> 04:24.750
He's 50 years old,

04:24.833 --> 04:27.708
and he looks like he's auditioning
for a boy band. Pfft!

04:27.791 --> 04:30.000
Uncle B, are you jealous?

04:30.083 --> 04:32.458
[laughing] What? No! Maybe.

04:32.541 --> 04:34.416
His videos are so cool!

04:34.500 --> 04:38.583
He tracks all sorts of animals,
and the best part is he never gets hurt.

04:38.666 --> 04:41.916
Ah! He's got
millions and millions of fans.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.125
Wow. Do you think that many people
will read your book about goats?

04:45.208 --> 04:47.625
It's not just about goats!

04:47.708 --> 04:51.500
It's about all my expeditions
and everything I've learned.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.083
Yes, there's a sizable goat section,
four or five chapters,

04:55.166 --> 04:56.541
but that's a normal amount.

04:56.625 --> 04:58.291
He did have some pretty cool gear.

04:58.375 --> 05:01.000
Maybe it's time we upgraded
some of our stuff.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.708
I've been holding off on showing you this,
but I bought a remote monitoring device.

05:04.791 --> 05:08.458
We don't need shiny gizmos,
tech toys, and fancy equipment.

05:08.541 --> 05:09.666
[groans, sighs]

05:09.750 --> 05:11.125
We should go find Danny Wilde.

05:11.208 --> 05:14.750
-He has a super cool robot medic.
-No! He's not to be trusted.

05:14.833 --> 05:17.750
I knew him back when
he was a real zoologist. [groans]

05:20.041 --> 05:21.041
Got another one.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.500
The Irukandji jellyfish numbers
are above average.

05:23.583 --> 05:27.291
-They'll have to shut down the beaches.
-For a tiny speck of snot?

05:27.375 --> 05:31.666
[scoffs] This speck of snot has more
than enough venom to kill both of us.

05:31.750 --> 05:32.833
[sighs]

05:32.916 --> 05:37.125
I've always liked you, BTG.
You're a really, um, special guy.

05:37.208 --> 05:39.458
It's time to go our separate ways.

05:39.541 --> 05:41.625
What? What… What are you saying, buddy?

05:41.708 --> 05:44.041
I'm saying I like you and I like critters,

05:44.125 --> 05:47.041
but zoological grunt work is not for me.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.625
I want something bigger and brighter.
I want to be…

05:49.708 --> 05:51.875
-[ship horn blowing]
-Oh, here they are.

05:51.958 --> 05:53.250
Here's some keepsakes.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.750
[BTG] What? But we still have to count
all the fish species

05:55.833 --> 05:57.250
in proximity to the Irukandji.

05:57.333 --> 05:58.958
Don't worry, big guy.

05:59.041 --> 06:01.208
I put together this little time-saver.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.500
I call it the Electro Fish Bomb.

06:03.583 --> 06:04.791
[timer beeping, ticking]

06:04.875 --> 06:05.958
No!

06:09.041 --> 06:10.041
[explodes]

06:10.125 --> 06:12.000
[electricity crackling]

06:16.666 --> 06:18.000
[gasps]

06:18.083 --> 06:19.000
Voilà!

06:19.083 --> 06:23.500
Once your muscles stop spasming,
you can count all the fish in the sea.

06:23.583 --> 06:24.500
Easy as pie.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.583
You're welcome. Now, if you don't mind…

06:29.083 --> 06:31.541
-[party music playing]
-[people yelling excitedly]

06:32.291 --> 06:33.666
[groans] Ow!

06:33.750 --> 06:35.583
I just need to cauterize the wound.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.416
Excuse me. [grunts]

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
[owl screeches]

06:38.583 --> 06:39.583
Hmm.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.916
[grunting]

06:44.541 --> 06:47.666
Bonnie, stick the fire in my neck hole.

06:47.750 --> 06:50.000
Really? There's got to be
a better way to do this!

06:50.083 --> 06:52.791
Yeah, maybe we should ask
the wise owl what to do.

06:53.458 --> 06:57.458
[BTG] Owl skulls contain huge eyeballs
but teeny, tiny brains.

06:57.541 --> 07:01.416
So, while everyone thinks owls are wise,
they're actually idiots.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.125
-[thuds on ground]
-[laughs]

07:03.208 --> 07:06.166
-Burn the neck hole, Bonnie.
-All right, fine. I'm doing it!

07:06.250 --> 07:08.333
[groans] No!

07:08.416 --> 07:09.583
[groaning]

07:09.666 --> 07:11.041
Let it burn!

07:11.125 --> 07:13.958
Let the fire course through my flesh!

07:14.041 --> 07:16.708
-[sizzling]
-[screaming in pain]

07:19.791 --> 07:21.625
-[monitors beeping]
-[BTG groaning]

07:26.916 --> 07:28.625
-[sighs]
-[whirring]

07:28.708 --> 07:30.000
Huh? [yelps]

07:30.083 --> 07:31.958
-[panting]
-Whoa, Uncle B, relax.

07:32.041 --> 07:32.958
Where are we?

07:33.041 --> 07:34.583
Okay, don't get mad, but--

07:34.666 --> 07:37.250
Oh, don't you dare say
Danny Wilde's medical tent.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.375
Uh, okay.

07:39.458 --> 07:43.083
You're dead, I'm a fallen angel,
this is what Hell looks like.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.708
Bonnie, listen to me,

07:44.791 --> 07:50.333
if my only choice is certain death
or asking for Danny Wilde's help,

07:50.416 --> 07:51.625
I choose death!

07:51.708 --> 07:53.500
-No, you don't.
-Death, I say!

07:53.583 --> 07:54.541
I don't get it!

07:54.625 --> 07:56.791
That medical robot fixed your neck.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.458
Being a zoologist
doesn't mean constantly suffering.

07:59.541 --> 08:00.750
Yes, it does!

08:00.833 --> 08:02.208
[grunts]

08:02.291 --> 08:04.375
-Ugh! [grunting]
-[thuds on floor]

08:04.458 --> 08:07.916
Someone needs a gratitude upgrade,
am I right?

08:08.708 --> 08:09.833
Is that morphine?

08:09.916 --> 08:13.250
What the hell is all this mess?
What happened to all the trees?

08:13.333 --> 08:17.166
Another terrifying predator
out here in the Prey-desh.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.708
<i>The rivers are teeming</i>
<i>with vicious crocodiles,</i>

08:19.791 --> 08:23.583
<i>making my hunt for the Bengal tiger</i>
<i>even more impressive.</i>

08:23.666 --> 08:27.250
<i>Just look</i>
<i>at that leathery bulk and savage teeth.</i>

08:27.333 --> 08:29.333
<i>What lies</i>
<i>are you telling your audience now?</i>

08:29.416 --> 08:33.083
Ah! Beefy Turd Greive.
I see you're back from the dead.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.750
That's a gharial,

08:34.833 --> 08:36.416
a fish-eating crocodile.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.250
They aren't dangerous to humans,
and you're hurting that baby

08:39.333 --> 08:40.708
with your fake bravado.

08:40.791 --> 08:44.208
They have narrow, weak, flimsy jaws,
like yourself,

08:44.291 --> 08:47.166
and if people fear them,
they'll be hunted to extinction.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.416
Give me a break. Look at this thing.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.166
It's a vicious, disgusting monster!

08:52.250 --> 08:55.666
Lots of animals look dangerous
or disgusting, but they're not.

08:55.750 --> 08:59.375
The Goliath bird-eating spider
is the world's largest spider.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.083
It's the size of a dinner plate,

09:01.166 --> 09:04.375
but its venom
is only roughly as potent as a bee sting.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.791
Oh yeah, that's the spot.
Can you do my shoulders next?

09:07.875 --> 09:12.208
<i>A massive five-ton basking shark</i>
<i>looks like it could rip you to shreds,</i>

09:12.291 --> 09:15.500
<i>but inside its mouth are teeny, tiny teeth</i>

09:15.583 --> 09:18.166
<i>that could barely scrape</i>
<i>the frosting off a cupcake.</i>

09:18.250 --> 09:19.500
<i>Nor would it want to!</i>

09:19.583 --> 09:23.083
<i>It just passively glides</i>
<i>through the sea eating zooplankton.</i>

09:23.875 --> 09:26.458
It's basically
the world's largest pool cleaner.

09:26.541 --> 09:30.250
And that juvenile gharial couldn't bite
through a French dip sandwich,

09:30.333 --> 09:31.750
so it's no threat to anyone.

09:31.833 --> 09:34.250
You really are out of touch, old friend.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.500
How do you expect me to get views
with facts like that?

09:37.583 --> 09:38.708
What's next, huh?

09:38.791 --> 09:41.500
You want me to interview
that deflated turtle?

09:41.583 --> 09:44.500
Well, actually,
that's an Indian softshell turtle,

09:44.583 --> 09:46.750
and they eat human flesh, so…

09:46.833 --> 09:48.875
What? [screams]

09:48.958 --> 09:50.791
Come on, Dietrich. [grunts]

09:50.875 --> 09:52.416
-We've got a goat to track.
-[whimpers]

09:52.500 --> 09:53.875
Fine, BTG.

09:53.958 --> 09:56.500
You may not agree with my methods,

09:56.583 --> 09:59.708
but you at least have to admit
that my influencer status

09:59.791 --> 10:04.250
is the best way to inspire more people
to get excited about conservation.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.708
Bonnie, we're leaving!

10:05.791 --> 10:06.666
What?

10:06.750 --> 10:09.041
I definitely wasn't reprogramming
the medical robot

10:09.125 --> 10:11.166
to inject me
with experimental drugs. [chuckles]

10:11.250 --> 10:14.041
Just stay a while.
I can show you how it's done.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.583
I can even help you promote
your goat bo-o-ok.

10:16.666 --> 10:19.416
[grunts] It's not just about goats.

10:19.500 --> 10:23.375
Soon, millions of people
will care about goats again,

10:23.458 --> 10:26.375
and in the meantime,
you can enjoy my wonderful facility.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.416
No, thank you.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.458
-We'll do it.
-What?

10:28.541 --> 10:31.208
Come on!
We can spend one day with Danny Wilde.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.208
Yeah!

10:32.291 --> 10:33.791
I'm hungry, dirty and scared.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.041
Let's spend 24 hours
not being those things.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.041
It'll be fun!

10:37.541 --> 10:39.166
[Dietrich laughs]

10:39.250 --> 10:40.208
No.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.833
I'll do it my way.

[thunder rumbling]

11:23.791 --> 11:25.791
[grumbling]

11:27.291 --> 11:30.166
There's nothing wild about Danny Wilde.

11:30.250 --> 11:33.458
All these crappy home comforts.
I've never seen anyone pack so heavy.

11:33.541 --> 11:36.541
His last name's not even Wilde,
it's Finnerman.

11:36.625 --> 11:39.291

11:57.125 --> 11:58.916
Daniel!

11:59.000 --> 12:02.958
Ah, Bradley, you've finally
come to your senses.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.291
-[muzak playing]
-Welcome.

12:04.375 --> 12:08.666
You had a Bengal tiger flown in,
and it's wearing a shock collar?

12:08.750 --> 12:10.375
Are you insane?

12:10.458 --> 12:13.875
Did you see all the trees he cut down
to clear a site for his stupid gear?

12:13.958 --> 12:15.666
That's probably
what happened to the loris!

12:15.750 --> 12:18.291
This isn't conservation, it's destruction!

12:18.375 --> 12:19.208
You know what?

12:19.291 --> 12:22.833
I don't need to sit here
while you lecture me on conservation.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.125
You're pathetic,

12:24.208 --> 12:27.708
scrambling around the woods
with your goofy costumes,

12:27.791 --> 12:31.083
bare-knuckled boxing bears
and bleeding all over the place.

12:31.166 --> 12:35.625
I'll do more for animals
on this single trip

12:35.708 --> 12:37.791
than you'll do in your entire life.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.166
So, just get the hell out of here,
all of you.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.833
Agh!

12:41.916 --> 12:43.583
[inhales deeply]

12:43.666 --> 12:46.375
-Let's go.
-Just five more minutes.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.583
My fascia is finally unclutching.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.375
[vibrating groan]

12:52.000 --> 12:54.916
By the way,
your logo looks like a burning turd.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.291
[BTG] <i>Having discovered</i>
<i>an illegally captured Bengal tiger,</i>

12:59.375 --> 13:03.666

13:03.750 --> 13:05.833
We've got to disable that security robot.

On it.

[owl screeching]

13:08.625 --> 13:10.083
Hey, no. Scat!

13:10.166 --> 13:13.000
Dietrich, stop bumping uglies
with that eagle-owl and shut it!

13:13.083 --> 13:14.208

13:25.083 --> 13:28.833
[Dietrich] Wow, it looked right at us.
These suits really do work.

13:28.916 --> 13:32.875
They worked for my mom, my granddad,
and for generations before them.

13:32.958 --> 13:36.833
Bonnie, once I disable the perimeter,
you unlock the cage door.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.583
-On it.
-Dietrich, stay on lookout.

13:39.666 --> 13:42.458
Okay. And if I hear or see something
that I deem suspicious,

13:42.541 --> 13:44.291
I will alert you with a call of alarm.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.083
Uh, yes, like a lookout.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.041
Hmm, mmm. [sighs, grunts]

14:06.458 --> 14:08.166
[BTG] Maybe, maybe not.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.458
Asian black bears
can walk on their hind legs

14:10.541 --> 14:12.291

-You wouldn't expect a--
-[Danny] What's going on over there?

14:14.791 --> 14:17.625
Nope, that's Daniel.
He's awake, and he probably has a gun.

14:17.708 --> 14:18.666
[footsteps approaching]

14:18.750 --> 14:20.791
[Danny] Is that you making all that noise?

14:21.708 --> 14:23.125
[snarling]

14:23.208 --> 14:24.291
Uh-uh-uh.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.083
All good.

[Dietrich grunting]

15:40.375 --> 15:41.375
Agh!

15:41.458 --> 15:42.500
[groaning]

15:42.583 --> 15:45.250
Okay, fine. Fetch the damn robot.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.291
Yes!

15:46.375 --> 15:48.250
After it sews up BTG's neck-gusher,

15:48.333 --> 15:50.500
can it laser off
my turd-mountain birthmark?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.250
Ugh! Maybe.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.750
Okay, we fix my neck,

15:53.833 --> 15:56.958
de-blemish Dietrich's butt,
and then we rescue Daniel,

15:57.041 --> 15:58.041
for old times' sake.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.625
Ugh! Fine.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.041
<i>But I'm keeping the robot.</i>

16:04.791 --> 16:08.416
Okay, so I'm testing
for the strongest animals in the compound…

16:08.500 --> 16:10.875
-I like it.
-…and I definitely think it's Blossom.

16:10.958 --> 16:11.875
Look at her!

16:11.958 --> 16:14.166
She's like 600 pounds of pure muscle!

16:14.250 --> 16:17.208
Maybe so, but she's still not
the strongest animal in this room.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.583
There is no animal on the planet

16:19.666 --> 16:23.500
with a higher muscle
to skeletal ratio than a python.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.833
Here, take this.

16:24.916 --> 16:25.750
-Okay?
-Yeah.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.625
This is python strength, okay?

16:29.583 --> 16:30.500
All right?

16:30.583 --> 16:33.625
So, pythons, they slowly encircle you,

16:34.125 --> 16:36.166
and they start the slow squeeze.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.708
They break all the bones,

16:37.791 --> 16:41.583
and they actually stop
the blood flowing in your body.

16:41.666 --> 16:43.208
I'm gonna fall down now.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.500
-[Bonnie] Ah! Okay.
-[grunting]

16:45.583 --> 16:48.750
This is where the python shows
her true strength.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.625
And she has a matrix
of muscles that overlap,

16:51.708 --> 16:54.125
each reinforcing the squeeze
from the other,

16:54.208 --> 17:00.791
until the… the countless tiny muscles act
as one gargantuan muscle.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.583
[Bonnie] So, you can
get out of this, right?

17:03.125 --> 17:04.125
[BTG] In time.
