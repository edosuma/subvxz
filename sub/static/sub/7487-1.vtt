10:21.031 --> 10:22.732
<i>before someone put a bullet in his brain.</i>

10:22.799 --> 10:25.100
He would've wanted his
champion, his gladiator

10:25.168 --> 10:26.701
to be here, fighting for him

10:26.769 --> 10:28.870
when there was still a chance
he could've been found alive.

10:28.938 --> 10:30.839
But now he's dead.

10:30.906 --> 10:32.841
Harrison doesn't want anything now!

10:32.908 --> 10:34.610
[Sighs]

10:36.946 --> 10:40.382
I've never once held a grudge
against you... not for anything.

10:40.450 --> 10:41.716
I've always forgiven you.

10:41.784 --> 10:43.184
You want me to forgive you?

10:43.252 --> 10:44.418
No. I don't need you to forgive me.

10:44.486 --> 10:45.620
I haven't done anything wrong.

10:45.688 --> 10:46.855
I was making an observation.

10:46.922 --> 10:48.356
I've never once held a grudge against you.

10:48.423 --> 10:50.125
I've always forgiven you... until now.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.994
You blaming me for Harrison's
death is unforgivable!

10:53.062 --> 10:56.798
You abandoned them, too, Abby
Huck and Quinn and Harrison.

10:56.866 --> 10:57.931
You abandoned them, too.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.167
You moved four blocks away

10:59.234 --> 11:00.901
into the most powerful house on the planet,

11:00.969 --> 11:02.503
and you left them out in the cold.

11:02.571 --> 11:05.473
I was on the other side of the
world, but you were right here,

11:05.541 --> 11:07.608
and all you have to give is three minutes?

11:07.676 --> 11:08.876
What kind of champion,

11:08.943 --> 11:11.011
what kind of gladiator does that make you?

11:12.181 --> 11:14.247
I'll make sure you have a date
and a time for the funeral.

11:14.315 --> 11:15.683
Show up, don't show up... your choice.

11:17.618 --> 11:18.652
Go home.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.953
- Liv...
- That is not my name.

11:20.021 --> 11:21.055
What?

11:21.122 --> 11:21.989
- Go home!
- But I...

11:22.057 --> 11:23.057
- I'm fine!
- But I...

11:23.124 --> 11:24.491
Damn it! Go home, Quinn!

11:24.559 --> 11:26.226
Leave me alone.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.129
Son of a bitch.

11:30.661 --> 11:32.261
Where are they?

11:32.329 --> 11:33.296
Jake.

11:33.363 --> 11:34.630
You scared me.

11:34.699 --> 11:36.332
I didn't know you were back in town.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.233
I'm not.

11:37.301 --> 11:38.668
- Where are they?
- What?

11:38.736 --> 11:40.436
Do you remember the last
time we were together, Rosen?

11:40.504 --> 11:42.138
Was that the time you killed three people

11:42.206 --> 11:43.606
or another time?

11:43.674 --> 11:45.341
All the fear and violence
starts to blend together.

11:45.409 --> 11:48.177
You told me you wanted
to take down Cyrus Beene.

11:48.245 --> 11:50.646
You told me you wanted to take down B613.

11:50.714 --> 11:51.914
You asked me to help you...

11:51.981 --> 11:53.882
"make these people
answer for their crimes."

11:53.950 --> 11:54.983
- Do you remember that?
- Yes.

11:55.051 --> 11:56.485
I believed you.

11:56.553 --> 11:59.488
I stole those files from B613
to help you go get the bad guys.

11:59.556 --> 12:01.090
Did you go get the bad guys?

12:01.157 --> 12:03.325
I spent two months going
through those files.

12:03.392 --> 12:04.593
I read them every day.

12:04.660 --> 12:06.695
I even created a color-coded system...

12:06.763 --> 12:09.464
<i>orange for scary, red for very scary,</i>

12:09.532 --> 12:10.933
and black for "crap your pants

12:11.000 --> 12:12.935
and wait for someone
to come kill you" scary,

12:13.002 --> 12:14.703
and most of those files, Jake, are black.

12:14.771 --> 12:16.071
Those files are terrifying.

12:16.139 --> 12:18.741
So pull the trigger or give them back.

Olivia.

12:34.156 --> 12:35.624
Sit.

12:35.691 --> 12:37.792
Mm. I ordered you a a glass of wine.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.326
You knew I was coming.

12:39.394 --> 12:41.395
I knew your plane landed this morning.

12:41.463 --> 12:44.232
Call me a hopeful father.

Mmm.

[Chuckles]

12:50.705 --> 12:52.106
You are spoiling me.

12:52.174 --> 12:54.207
The island was spoiling you.

12:54.276 --> 12:55.942
This is a bribe.

12:56.010 --> 12:57.578
You want me to go back.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.446
- Did I give you permission to leave?
- Dad...

12:59.514 --> 13:01.548
You shouldn't be here, Olivia.
You decided that for yourself.

13:01.616 --> 13:03.417
You asked to be removed, you
asked to be on that plane,

13:03.485 --> 13:05.719
and yet, here you are.

13:07.121 --> 13:08.789
My friend is dead.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.624
Harrison died.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.631
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:21.402 --> 13:23.303
Hmm.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.406
Ask me.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.075
Ask me. It's okay.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.544
I know you need to.

13:31.612 --> 13:36.115
I know that's where we are,
who I am, who I've been to you.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.319
Ask me.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.657
Did you have anything to do with it?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.492
Did you have Harrison killed?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.861
No.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.599
I had nothing to do with
your friend's murder.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.039
I can never tell if you're lying.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.942
I can never trust my
gut when it comes to you.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.276
[Inhales deeply]

14:05.345 --> 14:08.179
I did not...

14:08.247 --> 14:10.515
kill Harrison.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.518
I did, however... take care of your mother.

14:15.754 --> 14:17.788
You took care of...

14:17.857 --> 14:19.523
You...

14:19.591 --> 14:21.926
I'm sorry.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.128
Are you saying my mother is dead?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.563
A direct order from the president.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.999
He ordered... Fitz ordered her death?

14:28.067 --> 14:31.102
And, by the way, he did
you a favor, as well.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.570
No one knows... everyone believes

14:32.637 --> 14:36.106
that Jerry Grant died of
a quick and sudden illness,

14:36.174 --> 14:40.077
not at the hands of the
president's mistress's mother.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.755
Then he did the right thing.

14:51.822 --> 14:54.657
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

14:54.725 --> 14:56.293
She was a terrorist.

14:56.361 --> 14:58.295
She killed his child.

14:58.363 --> 15:00.364
She ruined our lives.

15:03.134 --> 15:07.303
I was sorry to hear about your friend.

15:07.371 --> 15:10.507
He was smart, gifted...

15:10.574 --> 15:12.709
always loyal.

15:12.777 --> 15:14.778
I imagine it to be a tremendous loss.

15:17.981 --> 15:18.948
You lose people.

15:19.016 --> 15:20.550

there's something big or...

15:31.661 --> 15:32.995
is there bad news?

15:33.063 --> 15:35.331
Something abroad. S... should I sit down?

That might make it harder for
you to run when I start yelling.

15:38.034 --> 15:40.035
What the hell?

15:40.102 --> 15:41.537
You should've told me she was back in town.

15:41.604 --> 15:43.472
Olivia?

15:43.540 --> 15:45.106
Cyrus, I... I just found out this afternoon.

15:45.174 --> 15:47.075
I know you just found out this afternoon.

15:47.143 --> 15:48.944
How?

15:49.011 --> 15:50.379
H... how do you know?

15:50.447 --> 15:51.947
That wasn't the question.

15:52.014 --> 15:55.016
The question was, why didn't
you tell me she was back in town?

15:55.084 --> 15:57.252
Are you spying on me?

15:57.320 --> 15:59.888
Why didn't you tell me
she was back in town?

15:59.956 --> 16:02.090
Are you spying on me? You don't trust me?

16:02.158 --> 16:03.825
Do I need to explain to you

16:03.893 --> 16:07.896
how dangerous Olivia's
return is to this White House?

16:07.964 --> 16:11.733
To this twisted but now
highly functioning White House?

16:16.438 --> 16:18.272
Sir, [Sighs] if you have a moment...

16:18.340 --> 16:19.774
Any news from the hill?

16:19.842 --> 16:22.543
Still 8 votes shy, but I think
we can twist DiMarco's arm.

16:22.611 --> 16:23.611
Sir...

16:23.679 --> 16:24.746
Schedule him for a sit-down.

more personal, more delicate.

I mean, I know she's not
brushing it or something,

16:37.959 --> 16:39.426
but she's washing it... it's clean.

16:39.494 --> 16:41.896
And she's happy, you know.
She's doing what she wants to do.

16:41.963 --> 16:43.864

about how I need to...

scene with a half-dead senator.

20:29.977 --> 20:31.344
Kate, you're driving her home.

20:34.281 --> 20:36.115
Dispatcher: 911. What's your emergency?

20:36.183 --> 20:37.817
- I need an ambulance.
- And the address?

20:37.884 --> 20:39.619
Ma'am? Hello? Are you okay?

20:39.687 --> 20:41.354
<i>[Camera shutter clicking]</i>

20:41.422 --> 20:43.889
Senator Benjamin Sterling is in
critical condition this morning

20:43.957 --> 20:45.792
after a vicious attack in his own home.

20:45.859 --> 20:47.660
Senator Sterling is widely considered

20:47.728 --> 20:50.029
to be the lion of the
hill... a crucial vote

20:50.096 --> 20:52.631
for the White House's
highly touted equal pay bill.

20:52.699 --> 20:55.000
Olivia: I'm giving you a
gift. This case is a gift.

20:55.068 --> 20:56.101
- I thought you left town.
- I did.

20:56.169 --> 20:57.469
- But now you're back.
- No.

20:57.537 --> 20:59.104
<i>- It looks like you're back.
- I'm not back.</i>

20:59.172 --> 21:00.439
- I'm only here for a couple of days.
- That sounds rehearsed.

21:00.506 --> 21:01.773
You're gonna take this case, Clark.

21:01.842 --> 21:03.375
I'm giving you this gift,
and you're gonna take it.

21:03.443 --> 21:04.910
[Sighs] I called you
because you're the best

21:04.978 --> 21:06.911
and you like a challenge,
and this is a challenge.

21:06.979 --> 21:09.080
<i>There's a difference between
a challenge and the challenger.</i>

21:09.148 --> 21:10.949
This case is gonna blow
up. It could be a disaster.

21:11.016 --> 21:12.351
I'm gonna take this case.

21:12.418 --> 21:13.385
Where is he?

21:13.453 --> 21:14.653
James Madison Hospital.

21:14.721 --> 21:15.887
The good news is that he might live.

21:15.955 --> 21:17.389
That's not good news.

21:17.457 --> 21:19.391
If he dies, Senator Vaughn
could face a murder charge.

21:19.459 --> 21:20.925
If he dies, he can't talk, Liv.

21:20.993 --> 21:23.328
If he dies, maybe Senator Vaughn
wasn't there that night at all.

21:23.395 --> 21:24.628
Dead men tell no tales.

21:24.696 --> 21:26.064
This is why I called you.

21:26.131 --> 21:27.298
I need to get her talking.

21:27.366 --> 21:28.666
You're going to take her in.

21:28.734 --> 21:31.102
As soon as possible...
tomorrow morning at the latest.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.803
Self-defense doesn't
have a great shelf life.

21:32.872 --> 21:34.572
It starts to smell funny
if it sits out too long.

21:34.639 --> 21:36.307
Where were you, anyway?

21:36.375 --> 21:37.441
On an island.

21:37.509 --> 21:39.110
That sounds boring. And lonely.

21:39.178 --> 21:40.478
Not as lonely as Washington.

21:40.545 --> 21:42.045
Hey, I'll call you after I talk to her!

21:42.113 --> 21:44.281
You're welcome, Clark.

21:44.349 --> 21:46.117
<i>[Camera shutter clicking]</i>

21:46.395 --> 21:47.495
Thank you. Have a nice day.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.533
You still not back for good?

21:52.601 --> 21:54.101
No, but I... this is the smart counter.

21:54.169 --> 21:55.969
You need an appointment
for the smart counter.

21:56.037 --> 21:57.838
<i>I have an appointment.</i>

21:57.906 --> 21:59.139
You don't have hardware.

21:59.207 --> 22:00.774
You have your appointment,
you bring your hardware.

22:00.842 --> 22:02.676
- Hardware.
- [Thud]

22:02.743 --> 22:04.544
That's brand-new. It's not broken.

22:04.612 --> 22:07.080
Smart counter appointments are
for hardware that is broken.

22:12.953 --> 22:15.054
Fill out this form. Your phone
will be ready in three days.

22:17.458 --> 22:18.958
I planned the funeral.

22:19.026 --> 22:21.661
I think it's going to be
nice. Harrison would like it.

22:21.729 --> 22:23.262
Well, he wouldn't. He hates funerals.

22:23.331 --> 22:25.765
But as funerals go, it's nice.

22:27.768 --> 22:29.268
What happened?

22:30.770 --> 22:31.904
With your family?

22:31.972 --> 22:34.040
Did you ever go back to see them?

22:36.009 --> 22:38.010
Huck?

22:38.078 --> 22:39.212
Huck?

22:39.279 --> 22:40.880
I am not Huck anymore.

22:40.948 --> 22:43.216
I stopped being Huck when you left.

22:43.283 --> 22:44.884
Huck doesn't exist.

22:44.952 --> 22:46.385
Read my name tag. It says "Randy."

22:46.453 --> 22:48.253
I am Randy the smart guy.

22:48.321 --> 22:51.457
That is who I am now. That is all I am now.

22:51.524 --> 22:53.158
And you are messing with that.

22:53.226 --> 22:55.260
When you walk in here, you make me hope.

22:55.328 --> 22:56.595
Randy doesn't hope.

22:56.663 --> 22:59.365
Randy works and he goes
home and he plays video games

22:59.432 --> 23:01.099
and he goes to bed and he wakes up,

23:01.167 --> 23:03.034
and he does it all over again the next day.

23:03.102 --> 23:05.337
Hoping is bad for Randy,

23:05.404 --> 23:09.140
so do not come back here
unless you are back for good.

23:09.208 --> 23:11.309
Next customer!

24:15.116 --> 24:16.783
[Moaning softly]

24:19.087 --> 24:20.921
They're making him into a saint.

24:20.988 --> 24:22.523
Jules.

24:22.590 --> 24:26.059
As we speak, Senator Sterling
is being canonized as a saint.

24:26.126 --> 24:27.761
Okay.

24:27.828 --> 24:29.495
We're taking turns.

24:29.564 --> 24:30.931
<i>Right now, it's my turn.</i>

24:30.998 --> 24:32.732
My turn is all about kissing,

24:32.800 --> 24:35.569
and my turn also has
various other fun things

24:35.636 --> 24:36.870
that you'll enjoy.

24:36.938 --> 24:39.272
What my turn does not have is talking.

24:39.339 --> 24:41.574
Mine's a no-talking turn.

24:41.641 --> 24:44.243
<i>When it's your turn, you
can talk, but right now...</i>

24:44.311 --> 24:45.478
[Laughs]

24:45.546 --> 24:46.912
... Be quiet.

24:46.980 --> 24:49.315
Let yourself be kissed.

24:49.383 --> 24:51.284
Wait your turn.

24:58.324 --> 25:00.459
<i>I think I need my turn now.</i>

25:00.526 --> 25:02.595
[Sighs deeply]

25:02.662 --> 25:05.197
[Grunts]

25:05.264 --> 25:06.331
Two seconds... I swear.

25:06.399 --> 25:07.499
Go.

25:07.567 --> 25:10.002
The press is loving this story...

25:10.070 --> 25:12.537
elder statesman, lion of the
party, attacked in his home.

25:12.606 --> 25:14.473
The man is lying in a hospital bed,

25:14.540 --> 25:16.174
being sainted and prayed for.

25:16.242 --> 25:18.743
He's a rapist, Jake.
He's a sexual predator.

25:18.811 --> 25:20.145
And the actual victim,

25:20.213 --> 25:23.181
the survivor of his assault,
the hero of the story,

25:23.249 --> 25:25.417
is a woman who feels like
she can't come forward

25:25.485 --> 25:27.319
because in a "he said, she said" situation,

25:27.386 --> 25:28.620
women aren't believed...

25:28.687 --> 25:30.254
because it could hurt her career,

25:30.322 --> 25:33.024
because the very fact that
some man put his hands on her

25:33.092 --> 25:36.060
could damage her credibility
as a United States senator.

25:36.128 --> 25:37.461
<i>He tried to rape her,</i>

25:37.529 --> 25:39.597
but she's the one who
suffers the consequences?

25:39.665 --> 25:40.732
That's injustice.

25:40.799 --> 25:42.333
It's just...

25:42.400 --> 25:43.701
It's wrong.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.671
Okay. I'm done.

25:47.739 --> 25:49.440
Your turn again.

25:51.276 --> 25:53.844
Come on. Kiss. I'm focused.

25:53.911 --> 25:56.547
Let's just... give it a sec.

25:56.615 --> 25:57.681
- What?
- Wait.

25:59.551 --> 26:02.085
I'm just saying, why give
up and make a statement

26:02.154 --> 26:03.787
before the press is on your side,

26:03.855 --> 26:05.488
before you have some ammunition,

26:05.556 --> 26:08.358
before you've had a chance
to really make a difference

26:08.425 --> 26:09.526
in the landscape of...

26:09.593 --> 26:10.794
Clark?

26:10.862 --> 26:12.929
Don't make a statement tomorrow morning.

26:12.997 --> 26:14.297
Because... I'm in.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.499
[Receiver clicks]

26:16.567 --> 26:18.568
The whole "you don't
work here anymore" thing

26:18.636 --> 26:19.935
is going right out the window,

26:20.003 --> 26:22.905
and the beach... is getting very far away.

26:22.973 --> 26:25.007
Should we talk about this?

26:25.075 --> 26:27.910
I thought we don't talk on your turn.

26:27.978 --> 26:29.011
Olivia...

26:29.079 --> 26:30.946
Oh, I'm Olivia now?

26:31.014 --> 26:33.316
We both know it's not my turn anymore.

26:33.384 --> 26:35.285
We both know we're not standing in the sun.

26:35.352 --> 26:37.286
We both know you're standing in the shade

26:37.353 --> 26:39.388
<i>of 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue, and it's his turn.</i>

26:39.455 --> 26:41.323
<i>As long as we're back,
it's always his turn,</i>

26:41.391 --> 26:44.860
despite the fact that I'm
the one you like to ride,

26:44.928 --> 26:46.896
that I'm the one that makes you moan,

26:46.963 --> 26:49.464
that I'm the one who
reaches you in places...

26:49.532 --> 26:52.267
That he can't begin to touch.

26:52.335 --> 26:54.269
Isn't that right?

27:01.110 --> 27:02.211
Quinn: Senator Stephanie Vaughn.

27:02.278 --> 27:04.379
Wellesley grad turned feminist icon.

27:04.447 --> 27:06.147
Known for her three-day filibuster

27:06.216 --> 27:07.716
of a Republican bill to slash sex ed.

27:07.783 --> 27:09.450
There's no evidence of physical
assault on Senator Vaughn,

27:09.518 --> 27:12.286
so if Senator Sterling wakes
up and claims he was attacked...

27:12.354 --> 27:13.922
This could become a "he said, she said"

27:13.989 --> 27:16.157
versus the most beloved and
revered member of the Senate.

27:16.225 --> 27:17.325
<i>[Camera shutter clicking]</i>

27:17.392 --> 27:20.795
North and the R.N.C. are out for blood.

27:20.863 --> 27:22.964
Senator Sterling's still in the hospital.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.298
The man's on his deathbed,

27:24.366 --> 27:26.166
<i>so we certainly can't count on his vote.</i>

27:26.235 --> 27:28.703
I think it might be time for
you to go press some flesh,

27:28.770 --> 27:31.739
lock down any remaining
votes, put us over the top.

27:31.806 --> 27:33.507
I'll head to the hill tomorrow.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.647
Is she staying?

27:41.316 --> 27:42.783
I haven't told Mellie.

27:42.851 --> 27:44.818
If she isn't staying, there's no need.

<i>If she is...</i>

27:49.523 --> 27:51.591
You really want to pretend

27:51.659 --> 27:55.262
we all don't know how this movie ends?

27:55.329 --> 27:57.530
It's not going to be a surprise, sir.

27:57.598 --> 28:00.032
It's rather predictable, really.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.269
She's Olivia. You're Fitz.

28:02.336 --> 28:04.237
And at a certain point
in time, the two of you

28:04.305 --> 28:06.439
are going to find yourselves
together in the same room.

28:06.507 --> 28:10.644
The anticipation... relentless, isn't it?

28:10.711 --> 28:12.545
We all know what happens next.

28:12.613 --> 28:14.681
We've seen this movie a hundred times.

28:16.917 --> 28:18.184
[Door opens]

28:18.252 --> 28:19.585
So, at 9:15 P.M...

28:19.653 --> 28:23.122
At 9:15 P.M., I entered
Senator Sterling's residence.

28:23.190 --> 28:24.991
You said at 9:15 P.M., Senator
Sterling offered you a drink.

28:25.058 --> 28:26.259
That's what I meant.

28:26.326 --> 28:27.994
So you arrived at the residence earlier?

28:28.061 --> 28:29.262
I guess so, yes.

28:29.329 --> 28:30.462
What time?

28:30.530 --> 28:32.598
8:45, maybe?

28:32.666 --> 28:34.733
There are no "maybes," Senator.

28:34.801 --> 28:36.335
Your initial statement has to match

28:36.403 --> 28:38.437
every single thing you ever
say about the night in question,

28:38.505 --> 28:41.173
or you open yourself up
to credibility issues.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.874
I'm a United States senator.

28:42.942 --> 28:44.843
You're a woman claiming to be
the victim of sexual assault.

28:44.911 --> 28:46.612
Clark, I need a minute
alone with Senator Vaughn.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.079
Do you mind?

28:48.147 --> 28:49.580
Not at all.

28:52.251 --> 28:53.384
Thank you.

28:53.452 --> 28:55.253
I didn't like his tone.

28:55.321 --> 28:56.955
<i>Then you really won't like mine.</i>

28:58.624 --> 29:00.058
You're lying, Senator.

29:00.126 --> 29:01.193
Excuse me?

29:01.260 --> 29:04.595
You are lying... about all of it.

29:04.663 --> 29:07.031
I hate to accuse a woman who
says she's been sexually assaulted

29:07.098 --> 29:08.366
of lying... I really do.

29:08.434 --> 29:10.267
I'd fight to the death
to stand by any woman

29:10.336 --> 29:11.636
who says she was assaulted.

29:11.704 --> 29:12.970
Women don't lie about that.

29:13.038 --> 29:14.939
There is overwhelming evidence

29:15.006 --> 29:16.907
that women do not lie about
being sexually assaulted,

29:16.975 --> 29:18.409
<i>but you are.</i>

29:18.477 --> 29:21.345
<i>And I know you are
because when that happens,</i>

29:21.412 --> 29:24.281
when a man grabs you,
puts his hands on you,

29:24.349 --> 29:25.749
<i>you do not forget it.</i>

29:25.817 --> 29:29.019
You remember every single
detail, every touch.

29:30.788 --> 29:33.157
So I'm gonna give you a moment.

29:33.225 --> 29:34.691
And when I come back,

29:34.759 --> 29:37.261
I want to hear the truth
about what happened that night.

29:38.830 --> 29:40.364
Kate, may I borrow your phone?

29:40.431 --> 29:41.264
Of course.

29:47.071 --> 29:48.538
Where are you? What do you have?

29:48.606 --> 29:49.439
Nothing yet. Why?

29:51.409 --> 29:52.642
The story's changed.

29:52.710 --> 29:54.810
I just accused Senator Vaughn of lying.

29:54.879 --> 29:56.679
You... What?

29:56.747 --> 29:57.947
So now we need another angle.

29:58.015 --> 29:59.082
[Sighing] Okay.

29:59.149 --> 30:00.984
I'm looking.

30:01.051 --> 30:01.985
B... but wait.

30:02.052 --> 30:02.952
What is it?

30:03.020 --> 30:04.487
Maybe nothing, but...

30:04.554 --> 30:06.055
all the women who work for Sterling

30:06.123 --> 30:07.223
kind of look the same...

30:07.291 --> 30:09.359
brown hair, brown eyes, kind of curvy.

30:09.426 --> 30:11.794
<i>I mean, I'm more of his
type than Senator Vaughn is.</i>

30:19.903 --> 30:21.704
Thanks, Quinn.

Ms. Pope, I don't know
what you heard, but...

I didn't hear anything. I didn't have to.

30:51.209 --> 30:53.643
Doesn't a Republican
president asking me to serve

30:53.711 --> 30:55.479
in his administration sound a little...

30:55.616 --> 30:58.018
Oh, I don't know... strange to you?

30:58.086 --> 31:00.220
Perhaps an underhanded
effort to buy my silence.

31:00.288 --> 31:02.089
You think I told Cyrus and the president

31:02.157 --> 31:03.389

Oh, we never left there.
You work for the Death Star.

31:08.065 --> 31:09.298

31:11.736 --> 31:13.069
Don't give me glory and patriotism.

They are Republicans, and
they don't even know your name.

31:15.045 --> 31:16.045
They know my name.

31:16.113 --> 31:17.713
They call you "Red." What is that?

31:19.683 --> 31:22.151
I didn't know that they
offered you Attorney General.

31:22.218 --> 31:24.253
They didn't tell me. I'm not on the inside.

31:24.321 --> 31:26.289
But if they had... and they should have...

31:26.356 --> 31:27.790
if they had, I would've said

31:27.857 --> 31:29.558

31:29.626 --> 31:30.993
who will uphold the constitution.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.195

David Rosen loves the law,

more than he loves me.</i>

31:35.666 --> 31:37.032

- No!

You were so obsessed with
those stupid B613 files.

31:39.335 --> 31:40.669

files and making charts.

31:44.774 --> 31:46.842
You were nowhere. You
killed us, and you know it.

31:46.910 --> 31:49.144
You want to blow up the world,
release those secret files.

31:49.212 --> 31:51.646

You want to fix the world?

They take me seriously.

32:06.529 --> 32:07.829

He wouldn't be able to
tell anyone any different.

in the Senate with him,

32:23.411 --> 32:26.112
you knew Sterling liked
young girls with brown hair.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.748
I just thought...

32:27.816 --> 32:29.683
If this makes the vote go down easier,

32:29.751 --> 32:31.418
if this gets us equal pay...

32:31.486 --> 32:32.986

32:33.054 --> 32:35.255
to have a Republican president
who supports a bill like this?

41:11.610 --> 41:15.546
<i>women still make 77 cents
to every male dollar.</i>

41:15.614 --> 41:17.882
<i>She just won us the equal pay
bill. So, we are here today,</i>

41:17.949 --> 41:19.149
<i>- and if you choose to speak out...
- No one can be on the fence now.</i>

41:19.217 --> 41:21.084
She's back, Red. Get used to it.

41:21.152 --> 41:22.653
<i>... to be heroes like Kate Warner,</i>

41:22.721 --> 41:24.955
we will stand with you,
we will protect you,

41:25.023 --> 41:27.324
and we will fight with you.

41:39.803 --> 41:42.171
Moments like this give
every woman an opportunity

41:42.239 --> 41:45.174
to decide what kind of
person she wants to be.

41:45.242 --> 41:48.344
Deep down, no matter what
face we present to the world,

41:48.412 --> 41:50.013
no matter what pain we're hiding,

41:50.080 --> 41:51.614
what struggle we've been through,

41:51.682 --> 41:52.682
we know our worth.

41:56.921 --> 41:58.954
We know what we're capable of.

41:59.022 --> 42:01.157
We know who we are, who we'll always be,

42:01.224 --> 42:03.359
and we have a choice.

42:03.427 --> 42:04.960
We can hide in the shadows...

42:06.863 --> 42:08.531
... or we can stand in the light.
