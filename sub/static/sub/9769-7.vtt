WEBVTT

00:07.059 --> 00:09.989
I'm getting pretty good at this parallel parking.

00:10.128 --> 00:12.029
That's not what this is, but okay.

00:15.453 --> 00:18.837
You know, it was fun sightseeing with you.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.679
How'd you know where all those celebrities lived?

00:20.828 --> 00:22.687
I've done some light stalking in my day.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.718
Ugh, look at this poor guy.

00:26.886 --> 00:28.745
He's got, like, ten tickets and a boot.

00:28.858 --> 00:30.991
I've seen this car. It's been here for like a month.

00:31.079 --> 00:32.375
Who leaves their car like this?

00:32.438 --> 00:34.097
Well, whoever he is, he's a big fan of mine.

00:34.151 --> 00:36.310
He's got a stack of my headshots in the front seat.

00:37.369 --> 00:40.365
Joey, when you bought your new car, you did return the rental, right?

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.767 --> 00:51.404
Nope.

01:26.473 --> 01:29.158
Hey, what are you doing here so early?

01:29.280 --> 01:30.535
I just had to get out of that salon.

01:30.826 --> 01:32.718
I hate work so much.

01:32.808 --> 01:35.332
I knew I should've been a corrections officer like that test said.

01:37.257 --> 01:38.667
Are you still having problems whth your boss?

01:38.964 --> 01:41.973
Yeah. Viktor's such a creep. He's always standing over me

01:42.032 --> 01:43.922
and criticizing me, telling me what to do.

01:44.078 --> 01:45.411
Like Mom with a mustache.

01:45.552 --> 01:47.256
Have you seen Mom lately?

01:49.768 --> 01:52.218
Why do you work at a job that makes you crazy, Mom?

01:52.353 --> 01:53.472
Easy, College.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.787
In the real world, work isn't always a picnic.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.160
Oh, please, you make pretend for a living.

01:59.941 --> 02:01.852
Uh, I have done my time in the trenches.

02:01.984 --> 02:04.420
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?
- Digging!

02:05.638 --> 02:07.816
What other job do you do in a trench?

02:09.566 --> 02:11.360
I just wish I had my own place.

02:11.572 --> 02:14.893
This way, instead of working for this horrible boss, I could be the horrible boss.

02:14.954 --> 02:17.442
Oh, yeah, you'd be good at that. You're always telling us what to do.

02:17.519 --> 02:18.060
Yeah.

02:18.857 --> 02:21.385
"Michael, don't sit so close to the TV, you'll go blind."

02:21.463 --> 02:24.386
Yeah, or, "Hey, Joey, get your hand out of your pants!"

02:25.756 --> 02:27.822
Or "Michael, tell Joey to get his hand out of his pants."

02:29.964 --> 02:31.643
So why don't you open your own place?

02:31.701 --> 02:33.011
'Cause I don't have the money.

02:33.076 --> 02:34.359
You must have some.

02:34.566 --> 02:35.299
I did.

02:36.003 --> 02:36.910
Now I don't.

02:38.888 --> 02:41.026
All right, I gotta get going back there.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.731
- See ya.
- Bye.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.610
She seems miserable. I wish there was something we could do to help.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.826
You could give her some money. Start her own salon.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.235
I meant, like, buy her a cake.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.836
Oh, come on. You got to have some money saved up.

02:54.878 --> 02:56.923
I do, yeah. But that money's safety net for me.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.068
And besides, it's not a good time for me to be spending money.

03:00.125 --> 03:05.031
I'm in a new city, I don't have a job, I got $1,200 in parking tickets...

03:05.613 --> 03:07.485
from a car I still haven't returned!

03:09.444 --> 03:11.200
But even if it's not a great time right now,

03:11.282 --> 03:12.941
I mean, it's not like you have to give her all your money.

03:12.999 --> 03:15.295
Michael, I can't dip into my savings, all right?

03:15.372 --> 03:17.089
There are harsh realities to being an actor.

03:17.128 --> 03:21.140
That money is specifically set aside in cawe I ever lose my looks.

03:21.270 --> 03:23.112
What? Why?

03:23.409 --> 03:25.743
I mean, even if you turn ugly, you're such a great actor,

03:25.840 --> 03:27.190
you'll still get tons of work.

03:28.155 --> 03:29.835
That is weak, dude.

03:37.334 --> 03:40.454
I cannot wait for my entire body to feel what my feet are feeling.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.334
How many hours a day do you spend in here?

03:43.469 --> 03:45.878
Well, my record is nine, but, uh...

03:46.424 --> 03:49.144
I was passed out for five of them.

03:50.738 --> 03:53.771
Oh, one of the kids lost his little military men.

03:54.121 --> 03:55.902
Sergeant Dropkick!

03:59.905 --> 04:01.618
So, Eric's coming home tonight.

04:01.761 --> 04:03.497
Your husband? Oh, great, great.

04:03.574 --> 04:05.600
I finally get to meet him. He's been gone so long.

04:05.658 --> 04:07.866
I know, but now his orchestra's playing in town.

04:08.001 --> 04:09.467
Oh. What instrument does he play?

04:09.505 --> 04:10.239
The viola.

04:10.354 --> 04:10.779
Lin.

04:13.465 --> 04:14.770
Violin.

04:15.897 --> 04:16.942
Thanks.

04:17.851 --> 04:20.680
Listen, about Eric, there's one tiny problem.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.971
I mentioned my new pal Joey to him,

04:23.009 --> 04:25.606
and I got the impression that he was a bit threatened.

04:25.715 --> 04:26.814
Come on. By me?

04:26.872 --> 04:29.361
Yeah, well, I told him about the two of us hanging out

04:29.419 --> 04:32.648
and I guess he thinks it's weird, his wife doing stuff with a single guy.

04:32.887 --> 04:34.314
That's ridiculous!

04:34.488 --> 04:37.680
I've always had women friends, and there's nothing sexual about it.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.683
I love the way women think,

04:40.214 --> 04:41.876
I love the way they laugh,

04:41.929 --> 04:42.410
I love the...

04:42.504 --> 04:43.934
I love their soft hands,

04:44.019 --> 04:45.899
I love the small of their back,

04:46.244 --> 04:48.592
the curve of their... Oh, I see why he'd be upset.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.854
But it's not like anything would ever happen with us.

04:53.144 --> 04:54.330
And it's a little insulting.

04:54.401 --> 04:56.420
Like I can't handle a couple of weeks alone.

04:56.502 --> 04:57.794
Like I can't go that long.

04:57.829 --> 05:00.169
Like I've just got to have it, and any man will do.

05:00.910 --> 05:03.534
Alex, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

05:03.810 --> 05:05.277
I do not have to have it!

05:06.294 --> 05:07.252
I don't!

05:08.208 --> 05:10.591
Okay, look, he'll see that there's nothing between us

05:10.580 --> 05:12.841
and that he has nothing to worry about, and he'll be fine, right?

05:13.049 --> 05:14.188
-  Absolutely.
- Yeah.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.139
And a little tip:

05:15.186 --> 05:16.467
maybe, just maybe,

05:16.490 --> 05:18.272
if you knew the name of the instrument he played,

05:18.342 --> 05:19.813
he might not feel so threatened.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.868
No,  I know what a violin is...

05:22.892 --> 05:24.220
There you go!

05:30.453 --> 05:32.261
Hey, Gina, sorry I'm late for lunch.

05:32.308 --> 05:34.234
That's okay, I'm just finishing up here.

05:34.718 --> 05:37.886
So where's this Viktor guy you keep complaining about?

05:37.945 --> 05:40.564
Around  lunchtime he either goes to the gun shop next door

05:40.610 --> 05:41.890
or the strip club on the corner.

05:41.977 --> 05:43.505
Nice neighborhood, by the way.

05:45.131 --> 05:47.162
So, tell me about your day. I'm bored stiff here.

05:47.233 --> 05:50.760
I just found out that Alex's husband thinks it's weird that we hang out.

05:50.961 --> 05:52.321
Well, it is a little weird.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.260
I mean, a married woman and a single guy...?

05:54.374 --> 05:56.196
Oh-oh, not okay.

05:57.849 --> 05:59.287
Oh, you speak English.

06:01.443 --> 06:02.583
Five years.

06:05.753 --> 06:08.489
Look, you guys hanging out would be okay if you

06:08.571 --> 06:11.042
knew her before she was married, which you didn't.

06:11.074 --> 06:14.454
Or if you're friends with them as a couple, which you're not.

06:14.542 --> 06:18.196
Or if you were gay, which... would be okay.

06:19.308 --> 06:20.981
Will you stop with that?

06:21.019 --> 06:22.671
He's an actor-- the lines are blurred.

06:24.292 --> 06:26.577
What, so you're saying I can't be friends with Alex?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.982
No, just maybe lay low while her husband's around.

06:29.017 --> 06:30.822
Otherwise, he's going to be threatened by you.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.396
You're a good-looking guy.

06:33.016 --> 06:34.667
Yeah, I guess you're right.

06:36.910 --> 06:38.918
Sometimes I wish I was only an eight and a half.

06:42.477 --> 06:46.451
Gina! I have some bad news. No paycheck tonight.

06:46.795 --> 06:50.596
All money from register went down stripper's panties.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.530
Who is this?

06:53.941 --> 06:55.486
This is my brother. He's visiting me.

06:55.658 --> 06:57.454
Oh, I forgot. This is not a salon.

06:57.513 --> 07:01.377
This is Viktor's House for Family Reunion, huh?

07:03.195 --> 07:04.757
I'll, uh, I'll get out of your way.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.204
The magazine is only for customers.

07:16.275 --> 07:18.023
So is the chair.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.535
So is floor.

07:21.594 --> 07:22.954
Oh, come on!

07:40.449 --> 07:41.682
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:42.451 --> 07:44.200
By the way, the rental car is still there.

07:47.609 --> 07:49.275
That's what this is for!

07:50.637 --> 07:53.764
Oh, hey, I went by your mother's salon today. I met her boss.

07:54.036 --> 07:54.940
- Pretty horrible, huh?
- Yeah.

07:55.409 --> 07:58.489
The guy's like a Russian Joseph Stalin.

08:00.989 --> 08:02.856
I can't believe she has to work there.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.897
Well, there is a way to fix that.

08:05.101 --> 08:06.064
Give her some money.

08:06.134 --> 08:07.621
Oh, Michael, I don't know, I...

08:07.674 --> 08:09.589
But just uhink about everythingshe's done for you.

08:09.688 --> 08:12.848
She found you this place, she, she made it into a home.

08:14.032 --> 08:15.605
If the situation were reversed

08:15.629 --> 08:17.275
she'd do it for you in a heartbeat.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.117
Yeah, that's true.

08:20.540 --> 08:23.171
And it would just be a loan. I mean, she'll pay you back.

08:23.605 --> 08:26.334
In fact, she'd probably let you name the salon.

08:26.358 --> 08:27.377
Ooh!

08:29.078 --> 08:29.971
"The Hair Place!"

08:29.996 --> 08:31.346
No! "The Hair Up There!"

08:31.382 --> 08:33.885
No, no, no! "Captain Fabuloso's Cave of Hair!"

08:36.946 --> 08:38.683
Okay, okay. Let's do it.

08:38.717 --> 08:39.996
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:40.044 --> 08:41.315
It's the right thing to do.

08:41.681 --> 08:43.501
Oh, God! Can I call her and have her come over so we can tell her?

08:43.596 --> 08:45.686
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna take a quick dip in the hot tub,

08:45.768 --> 08:47.306
so say, two, three hours?

08:47.355 --> 08:47.872
All right.

08:50.860 --> 08:54.541
Okay, time for relaxation, men. You've earned it.

08:56.089 --> 08:56.571
Oh.

08:57.005 --> 08:57.604
Evening.

08:58.003 --> 08:59.988
Sorry. I'll try back later.

09:00.034 --> 09:00.809
No, no, no. Not at all.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.254
Come on. There's room in here for both of us.

09:02.530 --> 09:04.694
Uh, not the way I hot-tub.

09:06.775 --> 09:11.409
All right, well, I'll try not to keep you and your "men" waiting long.

09:12.008 --> 09:14.356
What, these? These aren't mine.

09:18.419 --> 09:22.698
Thanks. So, I, uh... haven't, uh, haven't seen you around here before.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.571
Well, my orchestra's been on tour.

09:24.762 --> 09:27.787
Oh, you must be Eric, Alex's husband.

09:28.510 --> 09:30.033
I'm... I'm Joey.

09:34.011 --> 09:35.212
You're Joey?

09:38.575 --> 09:40.034
Oh, thank God!

09:41.022 --> 09:42.478
Oh, God.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.567
Man, that is great.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.176
Yeah.

09:46.297 --> 09:47.299
What?

09:48.111 --> 09:51.510
No, it's just that Alex said she'd been spending a lot of time with you recently.

09:51.610 --> 09:53.888
And I was just, I was expecting something else, that's all.

09:53.935 --> 09:55.402
Look, it is really great to meet you.

09:55.614 --> 09:56.950
Yeah. You too.

09:59.843 --> 10:01.913
Uh, so, we're good?

10:02.539 --> 10:03.913
Oh, yeah, we're good.

10:06.049 --> 10:07.505
Why are we good?

10:08.793 --> 10:10.417
What the hell's that thing for?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.023
Hey. So, Mom's on her way over

10:19.070 --> 10:20.855
and I'm looking at the commercial real estate listings--

10:20.902 --> 10:23.356
- Hey! Do you find me threatening?
- Not until this very moment.

10:24.772 --> 10:28.025
Alex tells me her husband is paranoid I'll steal her away.

10:28.063 --> 10:31.398
Then, he meets me, and suddenly everything's fine.

10:31.596 --> 10:33.760
Well, maybe he just thinks you're not Alex's type.

10:33.784 --> 10:36.472
Please, I've done it lots of times where no one was anyone's type.

10:39.593 --> 10:41.324
He doesn't think I'm good looking.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.070
I can't believe this.

10:43.117 --> 10:45.031
I'm about to give away my Lose My Looks fund

10:45.078 --> 10:47.173
and now I'm actually losing my looks?

10:49.379 --> 10:51.146
Joey... you look great.

10:51.603 --> 10:53.471
I mean, it was just the other day,

10:53.506 --> 10:56.419
you were up on that step stool and I couldn't help admiring your calf muscle.

10:57.654 --> 10:59.240
I kind of knew you were looking.

11:01.045 --> 11:02.301
- It's me!
- Oh, great.

11:02.348 --> 11:03.897
I can't wait to tell her about the salon.

11:03.928 --> 11:06.065
- Why do you get to tell her?
- 'Cause ygu get to name it.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.355
Oh, that's right.

11:10.010 --> 11:13.332
I'm really trying to imagine what's so important that it can't wait till after JAG.

11:15.195 --> 11:17.763
All right, come on, Mom. Sit down.

11:19.432 --> 11:20.806
There's something we want to tell you.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.150
Oh, my God. JAG got canceled?

11:24.360 --> 11:25.632
No, sit down. Sit down.

11:27.494 --> 11:28.187
Here.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.060
What's this?

11:30.192 --> 11:30.990
It's a loan.

11:31.060 --> 11:32.563
It's not that much, but,

11:33.077 --> 11:34.799
hopefully,  it's enough to get you started.

11:36.259 --> 11:37.553
Get me started with what?

11:37.703 --> 11:41.241
Captain Fabuloso's Cave of Hair.

11:43.378 --> 11:44.059
Mom...

11:44.892 --> 11:46.112
it's for your own salon.

11:47.168 --> 11:48.426
Oh, my God.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.691
Are you kidding me?

11:49.803 --> 11:50.961
No, no, no. This is too much.

11:51.079 --> 11:52.895
No, no, no, no. We want you to have it.

11:53.491 --> 11:56.458
Oh, this must be all the money in your Lose Your Looks fund.

11:57.679 --> 12:00.181
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.

12:00.956 --> 12:03.551
And, um, I'm going to cash in my savings bond, too,

12:03.575 --> 12:05.472
which I know it's not a lot of money, but it's yours.

12:06.012 --> 12:07.527
Oh, honey, you are so sweet,

12:07.562 --> 12:10.397
but I cashed that in, like, five years ago to help pay for your braces.

12:12.039 --> 12:13.399
I didn't have braces.

12:14.237 --> 12:15.677
You guys are the best.

12:21.729 --> 12:22.457
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:22.562 --> 12:24.664
I need to go in my room and study. What are you gonna do?

12:24.746 --> 12:28.463
Well, I'm luring Alex's husband over here with a pretend maintenance problem--

12:28.512 --> 12:29.545
because he's the super--

12:29.604 --> 12:31.994
but my real plan is to prove to him that I'm sexy.

12:34.499 --> 12:36.558
We lead very different lives, you and I.

12:44.706 --> 12:45.743
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:46.087 --> 12:48.040
So there's some kind of problem with the fireplace?

12:48.099 --> 12:51.912
Yeah, the flue seems to be all blocked up and I was hoping to light a fire.

12:52.494 --> 12:54.156
It's 80 degrees out.

12:55.338 --> 12:57.282
Ah, well, I'm always chilly.

12:57.381 --> 13:00.217
I have very, very, very low body fat.

13:01.231 --> 13:02.381
- Really?
- Yeah, well, me, too.

13:02.393 --> 13:04.342
Actually, I'm about 11%. What about you?

13:04.377 --> 13:05.308
Zero.

13:08.460 --> 13:10.186
Okay, I'll just, I'll check out the fireplace.

13:11.940 --> 13:15.455
Oh, would you look what someone left lying around.

13:17.374 --> 13:20.311
Soap Opera Digest from 1997.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.516
Look at that. Huh?

13:24.340 --> 13:27.285
"Most Sexy Newcomer: Joey Tribbiani."

13:27.803 --> 13:29.224
Who writes this fluff?

13:30.221 --> 13:33.192
That's an old photo, too,back from my modeling days.

13:33.531 --> 13:34.670
You were a male model?

13:34.752 --> 13:36.256
Well, I was, yeah, but I was,

13:36.375 --> 13:39.566
uh, run out of the business for being too promiscuous.

13:44.818 --> 13:47.048
Say, you, uh, you look like you could use a hand there.

13:47.146 --> 13:48.602
Uh, no, no, I'm good, actually.

13:48.626 --> 13:49.471
Either way, either way.

13:49.494 --> 13:52.661
Maybe I'll just roll up the ol' pant leg and lend a hand.

13:54.094 --> 13:59.356
Oh! It barely, barely fits over my muscular calves.

14:00.596 --> 14:01.324
Look.

14:03.748 --> 14:05.462
Okay. All right.

14:05.497 --> 14:07.000
I-I see what's going on here.

14:07.200 --> 14:07.857
You're gay.

14:07.928 --> 14:08.785
What?

14:08.951 --> 14:09.480
No!

14:10.055 --> 14:12.412
But if I was, I'd be attracted to myself.

14:16.994 --> 14:17.910
Well...

14:20.130 --> 14:21.602
Here's your problem.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.796
How on earth did a wad of newspaper got up there?

14:25.241 --> 14:26.699
I don't know, but, uh...

14:27.265 --> 14:28.831
it's today's paper.

14:30.857 --> 14:33.545
Honey, Bill just called. Rehearsal got moved up an hour.

14:33.604 --> 14:35.013
Ah, geez, I'd better get a move on.

14:35.154 --> 14:35.999
I'll hold dinner.

14:36.105 --> 14:37.540
Oh, no, no, um...

14:37.605 --> 14:38.415
Oh, have it with Joey,

14:38.438 --> 14:40.881
and I opened a great bottle of wine. Don't let it go to waste, all right?

14:40.928 --> 14:42.577
And, Joey? Be careful, okay?

14:42.669 --> 14:44.771
When she drinks, she will want to dance for you.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.596
- So, do you want to come over...?
- What the hell was that?

14:50.620 --> 14:51.488
Oh, okay.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.747
Your  husband isn't threatened by me at all!

14:54.806 --> 14:56.285
Oh. Well, that's great.

14:56.321 --> 14:57.810
No, it's not. Why isn't he?

14:57.857 --> 14:59.670
Maybe he thinks you're not my type.

14:59.813 --> 15:02.739
Okay, I did not want to have to do this, but take a look!

15:05.573 --> 15:07.053
Why doesn't he think I'm a threat?

15:07.419 --> 15:10.002
I don't know, but if it will make you feel better, I guess I could ask.

15:10.096 --> 15:12.351
Yeah, do that, as soon as he's done playing his viola.

15:12.456 --> 15:14.205
Damn it! Now you got me saying it!

15:22.073 --> 15:24.092
Now, this is a nice space.

15:24.163 --> 15:26.236
Good street traffic. There's great parking.

15:26.637 --> 15:28.686
Look, there's already plumbing for a bunch of sinks.

15:28.745 --> 15:29.775
We could put those over here.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.861
God, there's so much room. You could practically roller skate in here.

15:33.485 --> 15:35.393
How good are you at cutting hair on skates?

15:36.761 --> 15:37.841
So, what do you think of it?

15:38.740 --> 15:39.996
Well, it seems nice.

15:40.137 --> 15:43.425
Nice? Oh, Gina, this is definitely the best place we've seen,

15:43.512 --> 15:46.107
and once you sign the lease, you can order the equipment and start hiring people.

15:46.177 --> 15:47.856
And then you can fire people,

15:48.044 --> 15:49.711
and you'll actually have the authority to do it,

15:49.805 --> 15:51.257
not like that time we went to Home Depot

15:51.304 --> 15:53.520
and you started firing anyone who wouldn't wait on you.

15:56.061 --> 15:59.306
I mean, I haven't even said yes to this place and you have me hirino employees.

15:59.358 --> 16:02.208
Well, yeah. There must be room for, like, six stylists in here.

16:02.251 --> 16:04.286
Oh, they're going to have to learn how to skate, too.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.910
Six stylists? That's a big operation.

16:08.957 --> 16:10.867
Mom, you just gotta use a little imagination.

16:11.060 --> 16:12.648
We're gonna paint the walls, okay?

16:12.668 --> 16:14.538
We'll put some new tile down.

16:14.738 --> 16:16.307
You're kind of throwing a lot of stuff at me.

16:16.931 --> 16:17.342
Oh!

16:18.009 --> 16:19.940
If we put mirrors on this wall...

16:20.022 --> 16:21.961
and mirrors on this wall,

16:21.996 --> 16:24.592
then the bird and the fish can look at each other.

16:27.016 --> 16:28.320
Bird and fish?

16:28.472 --> 16:30.244
Captain Fabuloso's a pirate.

16:33.279 --> 16:35.561
No. Mom, I think we should take this place right now,

16:35.608 --> 16:37.472
'cause if we don't, someone else will.

16:37.591 --> 16:38.824
Maybe I should sleep on it.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.385
Come on. You gotta make a decision.

16:40.503 --> 16:42.592
I can't do this right now. I gotta go.

16:46.993 --> 16:47.909
What did we do?

16:49.309 --> 16:50.954
Oh, you know what?

16:51.743 --> 16:53.737
I bet she wants this to be her place

16:53.761 --> 16:56.469
and we're totally telling her what to do and taking over.

16:56.675 --> 16:57.251
Well...

16:58.413 --> 16:59.662
I guess that's true.

17:00.111 --> 17:00.956
You guess?!

17:01.050 --> 17:03.843
Come on, dude, some of your ideas were pretty stupid.

17:11.450 --> 17:13.002
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.944
So, uh, did you, did you talk to your husband?

17:14.979 --> 17:16.532
Did he tell you why he's not threatened by me?

17:16.876 --> 17:19.455
Oh, yeah, let's just forget about that.

17:19.694 --> 17:21.502
You did talk to him.

17:21.655 --> 17:23.061
I want to know what he said.

17:23.219 --> 17:25.003
Maybe he thinks I'm too attractive.

17:25.039 --> 17:26.691
He thinks you could never get a guy like me.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.384
No. And wow.

17:29.634 --> 17:32.253
All right. Then, what?

17:32.405 --> 17:34.190
Okay, well, he thinks...

17:35.011 --> 17:36.123
you're goofy.

17:36.820 --> 17:37.736
Goofy?

17:38.710 --> 17:40.554
Well, he makes snap judgments about people,

17:40.613 --> 17:42.800
and he saw you as this out-of-work actor

17:42.823 --> 17:45.324
who sits in the Jacuzzi all day and plays with toys.

17:45.418 --> 17:47.473
They're not toys, they're heroes, but...

17:50.015 --> 17:53.444
Okay, all right. Well, uh... great, mystery solved.

17:53.508 --> 17:54.972
I'll, uh... Good to know.

17:55.162 --> 17:56.509
I-I'll, I'll talk to you later, okay?

17:56.552 --> 17:57.598
Wait, Joey.

17:58.762 --> 17:59.889
You don't think that he's right,

17:59.925 --> 18:01.349
that you're goofy, do you?

18:01.430 --> 18:02.733
Well, I want to say no, you know,

18:02.792 --> 18:06.194
but then I look at these drawings of dragons I was doing all day, and...

18:10.940 --> 18:12.069
But that's sweet.

18:12.828 --> 18:15.519
and there's much more to you than what he sees.

18:16.272 --> 18:19.641
I mean... You're so good.

18:20.591 --> 18:23.679
I see how nice you are to everyone in the building and to your nephew,

18:23.726 --> 18:26.664
and  you gave your sister money to start her own business.

18:27.770 --> 18:28.732
How'd you know that?

18:29.059 --> 18:31.258
The walls are thin, and I'm a little nosy.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.470
And it's not just the way you treat other people.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.919
Iv's the way you treat me.

18:37.852 --> 18:38.580
What do you mean?

18:39.872 --> 18:41.387
You always ask me about my day.

18:42.486 --> 18:44.781
You know I'm lonely, so you include me in stuff.

18:45.382 --> 18:47.981
And to be this sweet and as great-looking as you are,

18:48.015 --> 18:50.128
my husband may not be threatened, but maybe he should be.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.998
But more than anything, you're just goofy.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.677
Yeah, yeah, I got the dragons to prove it.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.510
Yeah, right.

19:04.420 --> 19:05.125
Come in.

19:05.794 --> 19:08.891
Okay, look, Gina, we just came by to say that we're sorry, all right?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.511
We were throwing a lot of ideas at you. Some of them were good,

19:11.569 --> 19:12.720
some of them were Michael's,

19:12.826 --> 19:15.721
but we just want you to know that we are gonna back off.

19:15.752 --> 19:18.312
Yeah. From now on, the salon, it's your project.

19:18.394 --> 19:20.924
Yeah, yeah, you won't be getting any more input from us.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.954
Although it would be cool if the fish was a Japanese fighting fish. Oay, I'm done.

19:26.575 --> 19:28.902
You guys, that's not why I was upset.

19:29.939 --> 19:31.494
Then what was it?

19:32.132 --> 19:34.799
It's just... I don't want my own salon.

19:35.797 --> 19:40.257
Hey, Gina, look, I know what it's like to start something new.

19:40.319 --> 19:41.724
When I moved out here from New York...

19:41.794 --> 19:43.098
Oh, I cannot hear this again.

19:43.156 --> 19:45.314
People move all the time. Get over it.

19:49.672 --> 19:50.516
Wow.

19:50.728 --> 19:52.210
It does seem to come up a lot.

19:54.414 --> 19:55.652
The point is...

19:55.723 --> 19:57.660
it's natural to be scared.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.405
I am not scared.

19:59.668 --> 20:01.300
It's just that when we were looking at that place today,

20:01.312 --> 20:04.246
I realized that I don't want to start my own business.

20:04.679 --> 20:05.803
- You don't?
- No.

20:05.897 --> 20:07.527
It sounds like a lot of work.

20:07.644 --> 20:09.781
I mean, don't you realize this is the first time

20:09.934 --> 20:13.310
since you were born that I haven't had a ton of responsibility?

20:13.512 --> 20:16.746
And don't get me wrong, raising you was the best thing I ever did, but...

20:16.781 --> 20:18.022
it was work.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.846
I thought you said I was a really easy kid.

20:19.948 --> 20:22.709
Honey, the therapist told me to tell you that.

20:24.071 --> 20:26.626
Look, I appreciate what you guys are trying to do,

20:26.682 --> 20:29.711
but at least you helped me realize that I'm too good to work for Viktor.

20:30.239 --> 20:31.525
I am gonna quit.

20:31.707 --> 20:32.870
- Hey, that's great.
- Mom, good for you.

20:32.917 --> 20:34.661
- Good for you.
- It's twesome.

20:34.772 --> 20:36.965
I know. I just finished writing my letter of resignation.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.925
You think "dumbass" should be hyphenated?

20:42.178 --> 20:45.714
Well, when it's followed by that word... and that word,

20:46.041 --> 20:47.964
I wouldn't worry so much about the punctuation.

20:49.528 --> 20:51.853
Oh, and Joey, you should know that I got a couple of different job leads,

20:51.900 --> 20:55.152
and as soon as one pans out, I'll give you back most of your money.

20:55.349 --> 20:56.323
Yeah... most?

20:56.511 --> 20:57.991
Enough about me.

20:58.038 --> 20:59.999
How are you handling the move from New York?

21:00.034 --> 21:02.135
I thought you would never ask.

21:05.749 --> 21:06.606
Well, I did it.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.034
I am finally done with the rental car.

21:09.738 --> 21:11.534
- You paid all the tickets?
- Uh-huh.

21:11.714 --> 21:13.028
- You got the boot taken off?
- Yup.

21:13.247 --> 21:14.649
And you returned it? To the right place?

21:14.720 --> 21:16.225
Yes. And yes.

21:17.208 --> 21:20.590
I am taking off this string.

21:25.428 --> 21:27.597
What the hell is this one for?!
