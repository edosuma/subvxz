WEBVTT

00:06.577 --> 00:08.579
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

00:08.579 --> 00:10.511
GREAT JOB, GUYS.
YOU SAVED THAT ISLAND

00:10.511 --> 00:13.013
FROM THE BIGGEST
TROPICAL STORM IN DECADES.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.545
AND, LUCKY FOR YOU,

00:14.545 --> 00:17.588
I BROUGHT HOME A WHOLE BAG
OF HAIRY FRUIT.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.623
YEAH, JUST BE HAPPY I MADE HIM
PUT THE PELICAN BACK.

00:24.195 --> 00:27.498
GUYS, THAT MISSION
WAS THE FINEST USE
OF BIONICS TO DATE.

00:27.498 --> 00:30.361
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT STRENGTH PLUS SPEED

00:30.361 --> 00:31.662
EQUALS SUCCESS.

00:31.662 --> 00:32.633
( chuckling )
 Chase: UH...

00:32.633 --> 00:34.235
EXCUSE ME.
 ( chuckles )

00:34.235 --> 00:37.568
LET'S NOT FORGET THE MASTERMIND
BEHIND THIS ENTIRE THING.

00:37.568 --> 00:41.041
OH, RIGHT, LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR OUR FEARLESS LEADER...

00:41.041 --> 00:42.413
MR. DAVENPORT! WHOO!

00:42.413 --> 00:43.774
AH!

00:43.774 --> 00:46.117
WHAT? NO!
I WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.

00:46.117 --> 00:47.648
I SUPERVISED THE WHOLE MISSION.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.551
YEAH, BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHO DID THE HEAVY LIFTING.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.524
WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

00:53.524 --> 00:55.426
IT STARTS WITH AN "A",
ENDS WITH AN "M."

00:55.426 --> 00:57.488
THERE'S A BIG "DA"
IN THE MIDDLE.

00:58.589 --> 01:00.291
OKAY, GUYS. IT'S ME.

01:02.333 --> 01:05.266
PLEASE, THE REAL WORK
HAPPENS UP HERE.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.067
CHASE, NO OFFENSE,

01:07.067 --> 01:08.669
BUT YOUR BIONIC BRAIN

01:08.669 --> 01:10.471
IS NOT MATCH
FOR OUR HUSTLE--

01:10.471 --> 01:12.473
AND MUSCLE.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.106
OOH, THAT IS A GREAT
TEAM NAME:

01:15.106 --> 01:18.609
HUSTLE, MUSCLE,
AND CH...USCLE.

01:18.609 --> 01:21.552
MMM. DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL FIND YOU AN "USCLE."

01:22.683 --> 01:24.585
( sighs )
 I'M SO TIRED OF THESE TWO

01:24.585 --> 01:26.857
GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUPER-SPEED

01:26.857 --> 01:28.459
AND SUPER-STRENGTH.

01:28.459 --> 01:30.221
I NEVER GET ANY OF THE CREDIT.

01:30.221 --> 01:31.592
THAT IS NOT TRUE, CHASE.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.564
THEY JUST HAVE
A LOT OF FLASH.

01:33.564 --> 01:36.567
BUT YOU'RE THE GLUE
THAT HOLDS THAT FLASH TOGETHER.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.199
YOU'RE...

01:38.199 --> 01:39.800
FLASH GLUE.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.104
I'M "FLASH GLUE?"
 ( grunts )

01:45.105 --> 01:46.837
HEY, I THINK I
FIGURED IT OUT.

01:46.837 --> 01:48.239
AHH...

01:49.280 --> 01:50.341
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHASE.

01:50.341 --> 01:52.383
THE REAL WORK
DOES HAPPEN UP THERE.

01:55.286 --> 01:58.189
Male Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

01:58.189 --> 01:59.850
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

01:59.850 --> 02:01.222
FASTER,

02:01.222 --> 02:02.493
SMARTER.

02:02.493 --> 02:04.795
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:04.795 --> 02:07.358
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

02:07.358 --> 02:09.360
♪♪

02:45.236 --> 02:46.267
OKAY, GUYS,

02:46.267 --> 02:48.599
SAY HELLO TO MY
LATEST INVENTION,

02:48.599 --> 02:50.341
THE CRYO-BLASTER.

02:50.341 --> 02:53.804
THIS THING CAN FREEZE ANYTHING
IN A NANOSECOND.

02:54.805 --> 02:56.447
BRAVO, BIG D.

02:56.447 --> 02:58.409
YOU INVENTED ICE.

02:59.450 --> 03:02.453
NO, INVENTED A WAY
FOR ASTRONAUTS

03:02.453 --> 03:03.714
TO TRAVEL TO DISTANT GALAXIES

03:03.714 --> 03:06.387
WHILE FROZEN
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.520
WHICH IS A FANCY WAY
OF SAYING "ICE."

03:09.520 --> 03:10.521
( grunts )

03:10.521 --> 03:12.393
ALL RIGHT, HERE,
LET ME DEMONSTRATE.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.764
MM-HMM.

03:13.764 --> 03:14.925
YOU GUYS MIGHT
WANT TO STEP BACK

03:14.925 --> 03:17.228
BECAUSE THE RAY
FROM THE CRYO-BLASTER

03:17.228 --> 03:19.330
FREEZES EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES.

03:25.776 --> 03:28.509
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE
TELL THIS DUDE HE'S MAKING ICE?

03:30.381 --> 03:32.543
LOOK, EVERY SPACE PROGRAM

03:32.543 --> 03:34.845
IN THE WORLD
IS GONNA WANT ONE OF THESE.

03:34.845 --> 03:37.418
I JUST NEED THE ELEMENT
TO FUEL THEM:

03:37.418 --> 03:39.350
CYTANIUM.

03:39.350 --> 03:42.423
AND IT'S ONLY FOUND HERE.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.694
I'M SENDING YOU ON A MISSION

03:43.694 --> 03:45.656
TO THE MOST REMOTE PART
OF ANTARCTICA.

03:45.656 --> 03:47.658
AS OPPOSED TO BUSTLING

03:47.658 --> 03:49.630
DOWNTOWN ANTARCTICA?

03:50.831 --> 03:52.503
NO WORRIES, MR. DAVENPORT.

03:52.503 --> 03:54.905
WE'VE BEEN TO WAY WORSE PLACES
THAN ANTARCTICA.

03:54.905 --> 03:57.408
OH, YEAH.
REMEMBER BAKERSFIELD?

03:57.408 --> 03:58.939
( all groaning )
 OH, YEAH.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.372
LOOK, WITH YOUR BIONICS,

04:01.372 --> 04:03.013
YOU SHOULD BE
ABLE TO SWOOP IN AND--

04:03.013 --> 04:04.014
( computer beeping )

04:04.014 --> 04:05.446
OH, NO.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.548
THERE'S A MASSIVE STORM
HEADED THERE.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.680
SO, WHO CARES?
WE JUST DEALT WITH A STORM.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.582
NO, THIS IS A CATEGORY FIVE.

04:11.582 --> 04:13.524
IT'S MUCH MORE DANGEROUS.

04:13.524 --> 04:16.327
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CALL OFF THE MISSION.

04:16.327 --> 04:17.858
WHA--NO!
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME

04:17.858 --> 04:19.829
BEFORE THE CENTER
OF THE STORM HITS.

04:19.829 --> 04:21.591
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH THE RISK.

04:21.591 --> 04:24.295
I JUST HOPE THE STORM
DOESN'T COLLAPSE THE GLACIER.

04:24.295 --> 04:27.498
BUT IF THAT HAPPENS, YOU'LL
LOSE THE CYTANIUM FOREVER.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.440
I KNOW.

04:30.541 --> 04:32.543
BUT WE CAN DO THIS.

04:32.543 --> 04:34.845
( scoffs )
 STAND DOWN, FLASH GLUE.

04:34.845 --> 04:35.846
YOU HEARD THE MAN.

04:35.846 --> 04:37.548
NO ONE IS GOING,

04:37.548 --> 04:39.310
NOT EVEN HUSTLE AND MUSCLE.

04:39.310 --> 04:42.453
YEAH. AND MUSCLE
COULD USE SOME HELP.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.557
AAH!

04:46.557 --> 04:48.389
AAH, THAT HURT.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.761
GREAT, NOW I NEED SOME ICE.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.395
AH, THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.073
HERE YOU GO:
TWO CUPS OF HOT CHOCOLATE

05:03.073 --> 05:04.935
FOR YOUR PLAY-DATE
WITH JANELLE.

05:04.935 --> 05:06.407
MOM, IT'S NOT A PLAY-DATE.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.708
IT'S A STUDY SESSION.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.441
I HAVEN'T HAD A PLAY-DATE
IN FIVE YEARS.

05:11.442 --> 05:12.543
THREE YEARS.

05:13.584 --> 05:16.417
WHAT ARE ALL THESE GADGETS
DOING UP HERE?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.919
I CAN'T JUST INVITE JANELLE
OVER HERE FOR GEOMETRY.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.391
I HAVE TO PUT ON A SHOW...

05:20.391 --> 05:22.493
PULL BACK THE CURTAINS
ON LEO DOOLEY,

05:22.493 --> 05:24.955
ALSO KNOWN AS L-DOO.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.630
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CHANGE THAT.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.503
LEO, YOU KNOW YOU'RE
NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH
DONALD'S THINGS.

05:32.503 --> 05:35.566
AND IF JANELLE DOESN'T
APPRECIATE YOU AS YOU ARE,

05:35.566 --> 05:38.839
THEN SHE DOESN'T
DESERVE THE L-DOO.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.572
YEAH, YOU'RE CHANGING THAT.

05:41.572 --> 05:43.113
( doorbell rings )

05:43.113 --> 05:44.575
SHE'S HERE. GO!

05:44.575 --> 05:45.576
GO, GET OUT!

05:45.576 --> 05:46.647
EXIT. GET OUT!
 ( grunts )

05:46.647 --> 05:48.419
I'M GOING!

05:54.555 --> 05:56.126
HELLO, JANELLE.

05:56.126 --> 05:57.828
WHAT A SURPRISE.

05:58.889 --> 06:01.662
YOU INVITED ME
OVER TO STUDY.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.933
YES, I DID.

06:02.933 --> 06:04.064
THEN IT'S NOT A SURPRISE.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.097
SURPRISED YOU SHOWED UP.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.702
SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

06:11.702 --> 06:13.774
I MADE US SOME HOT CHOCOLATE.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.806
BUT WHY HAVE NORMAL
HOT CHOCOLATE

06:15.806 --> 06:19.450
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE
THE DELICIOUSNESS
OF A FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE?

06:19.450 --> 06:22.913
BECAUSE I WANT REGULAR
HOT CHOCOLATE?

06:22.913 --> 06:25.716
( sing-songy )
I DON'T THINK YOU DO...

06:26.857 --> 06:28.118
YOU KNOW, IF I RUN,

06:28.118 --> 06:31.121
I CAN PROBABLY STILL
CATCH UP WITH MY MOM'S CAR.

06:31.121 --> 06:32.923
NO! STAY.

06:32.923 --> 06:36.527
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU
ONE OF MY STEP-DAD'S
COOL NEW INVENTIONS.

06:36.527 --> 06:37.768
LEO, I TOLD YOU.

06:37.768 --> 06:39.970
YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMPRESS ME
WITH THAT STUFF.

06:39.970 --> 06:43.474
I'M HERE BECAUSE I LIKE
HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

06:43.474 --> 06:44.705
YOU DO?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.107
OF COURSE YOU DO.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.079
I'M L-DOO.

06:50.881 --> 06:52.483
( shrieks )

06:53.914 --> 06:56.917
IF I RUN, CAN I STILL
CATCH YOUR MOM'S CAR?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.122
HEY. MR. DAVENPORT,

07:02.122 --> 07:03.594
HAVE YOU SEEN CHASE?

07:03.594 --> 07:04.655
HE'S NOT ANSWERING HIS PHONE,

07:04.655 --> 07:06.727
AND HIS MISSION SUIT
AND GEAR ARE GONE.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.129
WHAT?
 YEAH, I'M WORRIED HE
WAS CARRIED AWAY

07:09.129 --> 07:11.462
BY A SMALL PREDATORY BIRD.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.505
GET HIM ON THE COMM SET NOW.

07:15.506 --> 07:17.007
GOT HIM.

07:17.007 --> 07:18.539
CHASE, WHERE ARE YOU?

07:18.539 --> 07:21.512
I'M AT THE CYTANIUM SITE.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.143
WHAT? I TOLD YOU
IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.515
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:24.515 --> 07:25.676
Chase: I'M PROVING

07:25.676 --> 07:28.118
THAT EVEN WITHOUT SUPER-STRENGTH
AND SUPER-SPEED,

07:28.118 --> 07:30.450
I CAN STILL GET THE JOB DONE.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.022
( alarm beeping )

07:32.022 --> 07:34.154
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE TRAPPED
BY A MAJOR STORM.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.086
GET OUT OF THERE NOW!

07:36.086 --> 07:38.989
IT'S OKAY, MR. DAVENPORT.
I'M ALMOST DONE.

07:38.989 --> 07:41.562
I JUST HAVE TO GET THE LAST
OF THE SAMPLES.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.495
NO. ABORT AND SEEK SHELTER.
THAT'S AN ORDER.

07:44.495 --> 07:45.566
THAT STORM--

07:45.566 --> 07:46.567
( rumbling )

07:46.567 --> 07:47.698
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?

07:53.173 --> 07:56.607
( screaming )

07:58.749 --> 08:00.611
CHASE? CHASE!

08:01.752 --> 08:04.484
THERE WAS A MAJOR AVALANCHE
AT CHASE'S COORDINATES.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.918
HE MAY STILL BE ALIVE,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

08:07.918 --> 08:09.119
ADAM, LET'S GO!

08:12.222 --> 08:15.826
( blowing )

08:20.701 --> 08:23.273
HOW ABOUT I PUSH YOU
INTO THE SUN?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.607
( grunts )

08:26.607 --> 08:28.238
HOW ABOUT I JUST
LEAVE YOU RIGHT HERE?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.043
Tasha: HEY, HOW'S
THE STUDYING GOING,
YOU TWO?

08:36.145 --> 08:38.589
PLEASE WORK,
PLEASE WORK, PLEASE WORK.

08:38.589 --> 08:39.820
GOOD ENOUGH.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.555
HEY...

08:44.555 --> 08:46.056
LOOK AT YOU.

08:46.056 --> 08:47.698
LOOKIN' GOOD...

08:47.698 --> 08:49.229
BECAUSE YOU CAN.

08:51.201 --> 08:53.604
WHAT'S THAT?
WHERE'S JANELLE?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.107
OH, UM...

08:57.107 --> 08:59.139
WE'RE BUILDING A FORT.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.571
YOU'RE RIGHT, MOM.

09:00.571 --> 09:02.072
IT IS A PLAY-DATE.

09:02.072 --> 09:03.744
WHEE!

09:05.075 --> 09:06.146
OKAY.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.078
WELL, I WAS GONNA
MAKE MYSELF A SNACK.

09:08.078 --> 09:09.319
DO YOU TWO WANT ANYTHING?

09:09.319 --> 09:11.051
HOW ABOUT A BLOWTORCH?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.052
WHAT?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.184
PIZZA! PIZZA'S GOOD.

09:14.184 --> 09:15.325
YOU KNOW, FROM THAT PLACE...

09:15.325 --> 09:16.987
ACROSS TOWN.

09:16.987 --> 09:18.589
THE ONE THAT DOESN'T DELIVER.

09:18.589 --> 09:21.091
OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE
WITH THE--
 THAT'S THE ONE.

09:21.091 --> 09:23.133
HERE YOU GO.
YOUR KEYS, PURSE.

09:23.133 --> 09:24.234
ALL SET UP.

09:24.234 --> 09:25.596
OKAY, BYE.
 OKAY, BYE.

09:25.596 --> 09:27.037
ENJOY YOURSELF.
BUY YOURSELF SOMETHING NICE.

09:27.037 --> 09:28.038
LOVE YOU.

09:28.038 --> 09:29.199
LOVE YOU.
 OKAY, BYE. GET OUT.

09:29.199 --> 09:30.270
I MEAN, GOOD-BYE.
 OKAY, BYE, HONEY.

09:32.242 --> 09:33.874
( sighs )

09:39.009 --> 09:41.712
CHASE MISSION LOG,
HOUR THREE.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.315
THESE COULD BE MY LAST
RECORDED WORDS.

09:45.315 --> 09:47.658
I'M STILL STUCK
UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF SNOW.

09:47.658 --> 09:49.259
THE AIR IS GETTING THINNER.

09:49.259 --> 09:51.922
I AM COLD.
I AM HUNGRY.

09:51.922 --> 09:54.825
AND THESE SNOW PANTS
ARE GIVING ME AN EXTREME WEDGIE!

09:58.328 --> 10:00.070
( digging )

10:00.070 --> 10:01.802
YES! ADAM! BREE!

10:01.802 --> 10:03.634
I KNEW YOU
WOULD COME FOR ME!

10:03.634 --> 10:04.604
I'M IN HERE!

10:05.976 --> 10:07.107
( grunts )

10:12.612 --> 10:14.244
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:15.786 --> 10:18.118
SAVING MY SON'S LIFE.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.032
( beeping )

10:33.303 --> 10:35.035
ANY SIGN OF HIM?

10:35.035 --> 10:37.007
NOTHING.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.069
I CAN'T FIND A HEAT
SIGNATURE ANYWHERE.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.171
WELL, HOW COULD HE
NOT BE HERE?

10:41.171 --> 10:43.844
THIS WAS CHASE'S
EXACT LOCATION.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.345
THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPLANATION:

10:45.345 --> 10:47.778
HE MET A FAMILY OF ESKIMOS
WHO TOOK HIM IN AS THEIR PET

10:47.778 --> 10:50.150
BECAUSE HE'S THE EXACT
SAME SIZE AS A PENGUIN.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.955
HE'S NOT HERE.
LET'S MOVE SOUTH.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.958
NO, GUYS, THAT'S IT.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.890
THERE COULD BE ANOTHER
AVALANCHE ANY MINUTE.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.162
I'M...I'M CALLING OFF
THE RESCUE.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.796
WHAT?!
 NO WAY!
I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT MY BROTHER.

11:06.837 --> 11:08.098
WAIT!

11:09.339 --> 11:10.701
THAT'S CHASE'S COMM SET.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.903
HE WAS HERE.
WE HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING.

11:12.903 --> 11:15.145
GUYS, I'M SERIOUS.
GET OUT OF THERE!

11:15.145 --> 11:16.947
( cracking, rumbling )

11:16.947 --> 11:19.079
HEY, THERE'S
THAT SOUND AGAIN.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.252
AVALANCHE! MOVE!

11:30.991 --> 11:33.193
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SOUP?

11:33.193 --> 11:36.096
I WENT TO COOKING SCHOOL
IN THE 90s.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.968
IT'S TUSCAN BEAN.

11:39.329 --> 11:41.101
IS IT POISON?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.332
YES.

11:42.332 --> 11:44.304
I FLEW 10,000 MILES

11:44.304 --> 11:46.476
AROUND THE WORLD
IN A MASSIVE STORM

11:46.476 --> 11:48.408
AND RISKED MY LIFE
IN AN AVALANCHE

11:48.408 --> 11:50.010
TO RESCUE YOU...

11:50.010 --> 11:52.913
SO I COULD THEN POISON YOU.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.993
( grunts )

12:02.993 --> 12:06.356
MAKE A PRETTY GOOD SOUP
FOR A DIABOLICAL MANIAC.

12:07.898 --> 12:09.800
YOU SHOULD TRY MY QUICHE.

12:11.261 --> 12:13.263
YEAH. MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

12:13.263 --> 12:15.135
I'M LEAVING.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.237
SUIT YOURSELF,
BUT YOU'LL FREEZE TO DEATH

12:17.237 --> 12:19.109
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS HERE.

12:19.109 --> 12:20.941
I CAN SURVIVE IN THIS SUIT.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.442
MR. DAVENPORT MADE IT.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.245
IT'S BUILT TO WITHSTAND
TEMPERATURES DOWN TO 45 BELOW.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.346
IT'S 50 BELOW.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.218
THAT EXPLAINS THE FROSTBITE.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.321
I'M NOT WORRIED.

12:31.321 --> 12:32.522
THEY'LL COME FOR ME.

12:32.522 --> 12:33.984
THEY ALREADY HAVE.

12:33.984 --> 12:35.455
WHAT?

12:35.455 --> 12:39.029
OH, THE WEATHER MUST HAVE
BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THEM.

12:39.029 --> 12:43.093
LOOKS LIKE ADAM AND BREE
ARE GOING HOME WITHOUT YOU.

12:43.093 --> 12:44.334
THOSE ARE THEIR G.P.S. SIGNALS.

12:44.334 --> 12:45.996
THAT'S HOW I FOUND YOU.

12:45.996 --> 12:47.437
YOU'VE BEEN STALKING US?

12:47.437 --> 12:49.199
YOU CALL IT "STALKING."

12:49.199 --> 12:52.903
I CALL IT "LOVINGLY
LURKING IN THE SHADOWS."

13:00.811 --> 13:01.982
LEO!

13:04.084 --> 13:05.055
MOM.

13:05.055 --> 13:07.017
IS THAT JANELLE?

13:07.017 --> 13:08.418
YES.

13:08.418 --> 13:10.420
IS SHE COMPLETELY FROZEN?

13:10.420 --> 13:12.162
YES.

13:12.162 --> 13:14.124
YOU FROZE HER WITH ONE
OF DONALD'S GADGETS

13:14.124 --> 13:17.497
THAT I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU
NOT TO TOUCH?!

13:18.498 --> 13:19.870
YOU'RE ON A ROLL, MOM.

13:21.031 --> 13:24.204
AND NOW I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.036
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!

13:26.036 --> 13:28.078
I DON'T KNOW!

13:28.078 --> 13:30.380
I'VE NEVER
FROZEN ANYBODY BEFORE!

13:30.380 --> 13:33.513
GIVE ME THAT THING
BEFORE YOU FREEZE SOMEBODY ELSE!

13:33.513 --> 13:34.514
NO, MOM, DON'T!
 ( screams )

13:35.485 --> 13:36.987
( screams )

13:38.188 --> 13:41.191
OKAY, THAT IS ALL
ON YOU, LADY.

13:47.057 --> 13:50.000
SO, WHAT'S ON YOUR AGENDA
FOR THE DAY?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.163
BUILD SOME BOMBS?
TAKE OVER A TINY COUNTRY?

13:53.163 --> 13:55.105
STEAL MONEY FROM OLD LADIES?

13:55.105 --> 13:57.207
NO!

13:57.207 --> 13:59.940
WELL, NOT IN THAT ORDER.

14:01.471 --> 14:02.472
OH, COME ON.

14:02.472 --> 14:04.214
I'M NOT THAT BAD
OF A GUY.

14:04.214 --> 14:06.046
YOU TRAPPED US IN A DUNGEON

14:06.046 --> 14:08.518
AND THEN TRIED TO TURN US
INTO YOUR BIONIC SOLDIERS.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.280
OKAY, OKAY.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.522
SO I MIGHT'VE OVERREACTED

14:12.522 --> 14:16.056
WITH THAT WHOLE...
ABDUCTION THING.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.188
I WAS NEVER GONNA HURT ANYBODY.

14:18.188 --> 14:20.490
I JUST WANTED TO GET BACK
AT DONALD.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.963
WHEN ARE THE TWO OF YOU
JUST GONNA GROW UP?

14:22.963 --> 14:26.096
I'LL GROW UP
WHEN HE GROWS UP!

14:28.038 --> 14:30.470
LOOK, CHASE...

14:31.471 --> 14:33.373
YOU AND I HAVE A LOT MORE
IN COMMON

14:33.373 --> 14:35.045
THAN YOU THINK.

14:35.045 --> 14:38.008
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE UNAPPRECIATED,

14:38.008 --> 14:42.152
TO HAVE A SIBLING
WHO ALWAYS STEALS THE SPOTLIGHT.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.155
I KNOW HOW HARD
IT'S BEEN FOR YOU.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.088
AND I CAN HELP.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.091
FOR THE LAST TIME,
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.994
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU...

14:53.994 --> 14:56.326
YOU CAN BE STRONGER THAN ADAM

14:56.326 --> 14:58.498
AND FASTER THAN BREE?

15:00.030 --> 15:02.472
I CAN MAKE IT SO YOU
HAVE ALL THREE ABILITIES:

15:02.472 --> 15:04.234
SPEED, STRENGTH,

15:04.234 --> 15:06.076
AND INTELLIGENCE.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.478
HOW?

15:08.478 --> 15:11.281
YOU WERE THE THIRD ONE.

15:11.281 --> 15:13.343
BY THE TIME I GOT TO YOU,

15:13.343 --> 15:16.186
I KNEW HOW TO BUILD IN
CAPACITY FOR UPGRADES.

15:17.147 --> 15:20.951
BUT MY BROTHER TOOK YOU AWAY
BEFORE I COULD FINISH.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.126
JOIN ME, CHASE.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.497
I CAN HELP YOU

15:27.497 --> 15:30.660
BE ALL THAT YOU
WERE MEANT TO BE.

15:33.063 --> 15:34.204
DEVILED EGG?

15:38.068 --> 15:41.141
BUT IF I GO WITH YOU,
THAT MEANS I'M ABANDONING
MY FAMILY.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.143
THE SAME FAMILY
THAT MOCKS YOU

15:43.143 --> 15:45.315
AND NEVER GIVES YOU
THE CREDIT YOU DESERVE

15:45.315 --> 15:46.576
FOR ANYTHING?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.521
WHAT WOULD I HAVE TO DO?

15:51.521 --> 15:55.025
I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE
YOUR BIONIC CHIP.

15:55.025 --> 15:57.157
AS YOU CAN SEE, I...

15:57.157 --> 15:58.488
NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS

15:58.488 --> 16:01.031
TO STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEMS.

16:02.332 --> 16:05.335
SO, WE'LL HAVE TO USE
DONALD'S CYBERDESK.

16:07.037 --> 16:10.970
YEAH, I GUESS I COULD
SNEAK YOU INTO THE LAB.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.103
MR. DAVENPORT WON'T BE THERE.

16:13.103 --> 16:15.075
IT'S WEDNESDAY, WHICH MEANS...

16:15.075 --> 16:17.607
SOMETHING'S GETTING WAXED.

16:17.607 --> 16:19.179
HE IS HAIRY.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.981
HE GETS THAT FROM OUR MOM.

16:23.713 --> 16:27.057
IT'S PERFECT.
WE'LL BE IN AND OUT
BEFORE ANYONE KNOWS WE'RE THERE.

16:28.058 --> 16:30.320
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

16:30.320 --> 16:33.123
ALL RIGHT, MR. DAVENPORT.

16:33.123 --> 16:34.264
I'M IN.

16:34.264 --> 16:35.365
SUPER.

16:35.365 --> 16:37.667
( both chuckling )

16:37.667 --> 16:40.670
IF YOU WANT,
YOU COULD CALL ME "DAD."

16:40.670 --> 16:42.772
NO, I'M GOOD.

16:47.137 --> 16:48.108
MELT, WOMAN.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.639
WHY WON'T YOU MELT?!

16:51.481 --> 16:53.583
( phone ringing )

16:56.146 --> 16:57.687
HELLO?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.421
OH, YES.
JANELLE'S STILL HERE.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.095
OH, YOU'RE COMING
TO PICK HER UP?

17:05.095 --> 17:07.696
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

17:07.696 --> 17:10.099
YEAH, OKAY.
SEE YOU SOON.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.361
ALL RIGHT.
BUH-BYE.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.031
( phone beeps )

17:14.704 --> 17:19.038
WHY?!

17:20.710 --> 17:22.212
( zapping )
 OW!

17:24.243 --> 17:26.076
THE DOWNLOAD
IS ALMOST FINISHED.

17:26.076 --> 17:29.119
THREE MORE MINUTES,
AND I CAN GIVE YOU EVERYTHING
THAT ADAM AND BREE HAVE...

17:29.119 --> 17:30.120
( chuckles )

17:30.120 --> 17:32.122
PLUS THE CAPACITY FOR MORE.
 ( chuckles )

17:32.122 --> 17:34.454
( door opens )

17:34.454 --> 17:37.127
DON'T GIVE UP, GUYS.
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE
WE CAN FIND HIM.

17:38.128 --> 17:39.559
CHASE!

17:39.559 --> 17:40.560
YOU'RE ALIVE.
 ( gasps )

17:41.661 --> 17:42.662
( gasps )

17:42.662 --> 17:44.634
IT'S EVIL UNCLE DADDY!

17:46.236 --> 17:47.667
BACK AWAY FROM HIM, CHASE.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.469
IT'S TOO LATE, DONALD.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.271
HE'S WITH ME NOW.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.143
WHAT?

17:53.143 --> 17:54.844
CHASE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:54.844 --> 17:56.506
IT'S TRUE.

17:56.506 --> 17:59.149
I'VE FINALLY TAKEN BACK
WHAT WAS STOLEN FROM ME.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.353
ALL RIGHT, BIG D.
I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TOUCH YOUR STUFF,

18:03.353 --> 18:05.155
BUT YOU KNOW HOW
SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN,

18:05.155 --> 18:07.617
AND SOMETIMES THINGS
HAPPEN WHEN YOU REALLY
DON'T WANT THEM TO HAPPEN,

18:07.617 --> 18:09.589
AND THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.161
UPSTAIRS.

18:13.423 --> 18:14.824
( shrieks )

18:15.825 --> 18:17.567
WHATEVER YOU'RE UP TO,
DOUGLAS,

18:17.567 --> 18:19.669
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT.
 ( beeping )

18:19.669 --> 18:21.501
I JUST DID.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.273
THE DOWNLOAD'S FINISHED.

18:23.273 --> 18:27.377
I NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO GIVE CHASE ALL THREE
BIONIC ABILITIES.

18:27.377 --> 18:29.609
AND NOW NO ONE
WILL BE ABLE TO STOP US.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.181
( Douglas laughing )

18:31.181 --> 18:32.812
ACTUALLY, THEY CAN.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.585
THAT USB DRIVE YOU'RE HOLDING
IS COMPLETELY USELESS.

18:35.585 --> 18:37.147
WHAT?!

18:37.147 --> 18:39.149
WELL THEN WHAT JUST
TOOK AN HOUR AND A HALF
TO DOWNLOAD?!

18:39.149 --> 18:41.221
A LIST OF EVERYTHING
ADAM'S EVER EATEN.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.854
NOT MY INCREDIBLE EDIBLES!

18:46.196 --> 18:48.328
YOU DOUBLE-CROSSED ME.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.531
DID YOU REALLY
THINK I WOULD
BETRAY MY OWN FAMILY?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.903
WELL IT'S ALWAYS
WORKED FOR ME.

18:55.205 --> 18:58.168
EVEN IF YOU COULD OFFER ME
EVERY ABILITY THERE IS,

18:58.168 --> 18:59.869
I WOULD NEVER
GO TO YOUR SIDE.

18:59.869 --> 19:01.211
WE'RE A TEAM.

19:02.312 --> 19:04.514
AND TEAMS NEVER
QUIT ON EACH OTHER.

19:04.514 --> 19:06.816
ALL RIGHT!

19:06.816 --> 19:08.418
YOU GOT ME.

19:08.418 --> 19:09.919
( chuckles )

19:09.919 --> 19:12.322
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JUST...

19:12.322 --> 19:16.155
PUT ALL THIS BEHIND US
AND GET DOWN TO THE BUSINESS

19:16.155 --> 19:17.657
OF HEALING THIS FAMILY?

19:18.788 --> 19:20.190
AM I RIGHT?

19:20.190 --> 19:21.931
BRING IT IN, PEOPLE.
LET'S HUG IT OUT.

19:21.931 --> 19:23.363
ADAM.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.237
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY...

19:27.237 --> 19:28.898
IF YOU CAN'T JOIN 'EM--

19:28.898 --> 19:30.169
GET DOWN!

19:38.248 --> 19:40.510
WOW! YOU FROZE HIM!

19:41.751 --> 19:43.182
UM...

19:43.182 --> 19:46.216
NOW, EXACTLY HOW WOULD SOMEONE
GO ABOUT UNFREEZING SOMEONE?

19:46.216 --> 19:48.888
'CAUSE IT IS NOT THE BUTTON
LOCATED HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE,

19:48.888 --> 19:50.960
HERE, OR HERE.

19:52.962 --> 19:54.924
MR. DAVENPORT,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

19:54.924 --> 19:56.926
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE
WARNED YOU ABOUT DOUGLAS.

19:56.926 --> 19:58.728
I JUST KNEW THAT IF I COULD
GET HIM BACK HERE,

19:58.728 --> 20:00.370
THEN WE COULD TRAP HIM
FOR GOOD.

20:00.370 --> 20:03.703
GOOD WORK, CHASE.
YOU MAKE A GREAT DOUBLE AGENT.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.375
THANK YOU.

20:05.375 --> 20:07.437
OH, AND I ALMOST FORGOT.

20:08.878 --> 20:10.380
HERE'S YOUR CYTANIUM.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.881
OH! MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY!

20:11.881 --> 20:12.942
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.

20:12.942 --> 20:14.284
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MON--

20:14.284 --> 20:15.285
I'M SORRY.

20:15.285 --> 20:17.347
I MEAN, "THANK YOU."
 MM-HMM.

20:25.695 --> 20:28.698
SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO WITH FROZEN UNCLE DOUGIE?

20:28.698 --> 20:31.331
I DON'T KNOW--WE COULD
PROBABLY SHIP HIM OFF TO ONE
OF MY OFFSHORE FACILITIES.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.532
OR WE COULD GET SOME ROCK SALT

20:32.532 --> 20:35.004
AND MAKE THE EVILEST BATCH
OF ICE CREAM EVER.

20:35.004 --> 20:36.636
MMM...

20:38.568 --> 20:41.611
SPEAKING OF THE "UNFREEZE"
BUTTON...

20:41.611 --> 20:44.514
WE WEREN'T SPEAKING
OF THE "UNFREEZE" BUTTON.

20:44.514 --> 20:46.676
WELL, WE PROBABLY SHOULD.

20:47.977 --> 20:49.549
YEP. THEY'RE FROZEN.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.022
OOH, ICE! MMM.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.825
WE HAVE TO FIX THIS!

20:55.825 --> 20:57.457
JANELLE'S MOM
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE!

20:57.457 --> 20:59.028
OKAY, I'LL JUST
USE MY HEAT VISION.

20:59.028 --> 21:01.691
NO, THEN JANELLE WOULD
SEE YOU USING YOUR BIONICS.

21:01.691 --> 21:04.534
NOT WHILE SHE'S FROZEN
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.697
YOU HEARD THE MAN!
LIGHT 'EM UP!

21:07.697 --> 21:09.299
OH, WAIT.

21:09.299 --> 21:12.672
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
THESE LADIES ARE GONNA
BE REALLY UPSET.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.404
I NEED A RUNNING START.

21:16.506 --> 21:18.408
WAIT! ME, TOO.

21:19.809 --> 21:21.711
STEP BACK, GUYS.

21:33.723 --> 21:34.864
WHAT...

21:34.864 --> 21:36.666
HAPPENED?

21:36.666 --> 21:38.398
LEO HAPPENED.
