WEBVTT

00:48.114 --> 00:50.650
Why is life so hard?

00:50.717 --> 00:52.886
Who said that life was beautiful?

00:52.952 --> 00:55.288
Since I was born, all that life gave me

00:55.355 --> 00:57.757
Was more trials to overcome

00:57.824 --> 00:59.692
During those times,
I looked into the mirror

00:59.759 --> 01:02.162
And asked myself, "What did I do wrong?"

01:02.228 --> 01:04.764
What did I do to deserve this?

01:04.831 --> 01:07.167
It feels like it'll never change

01:07.233 --> 01:09.335
Don't you crumble under the pressure...

01:09.402 --> 01:11.071
Our efforts are bearing fruit.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.440
JB's finally on the move.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.144
I'm certain that

01:19.679 --> 01:21.114
JB will be able to...

01:22.415 --> 01:23.450
rise higher.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.918
Look at us

01:24.984 --> 01:29.189
When you're tired and exhausted,
Lean on me

01:29.422 --> 01:34.260
I will always be by your side

01:34.761 --> 01:39.232
So that you never feel like
You're alone...

01:39.299 --> 01:41.000
Not bad, Ms. Hyeon.

01:42.368 --> 01:43.470
Pardon?

01:44.571 --> 01:49.209
Your students have found a way
to move people.

01:51.911 --> 01:52.979
Sincerity.

01:54.247 --> 01:57.450
You see, the key to this mission
was sincerity.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.052
...Alone in the dark

01:59.119 --> 02:03.556
I want to fly towards that bright light,
But I can't

02:03.623 --> 02:05.191
But that's not the case

02:05.258 --> 02:08.528
So much can happen
By lighting that one small candle

02:08.595 --> 02:13.199
I believed that there was nothing else
Around me, but there was another candle

02:13.266 --> 02:15.401
And when I lit it, they became two

02:15.468 --> 02:17.837
By the light of two candles,
I can find more

02:17.904 --> 02:19.806
And two becomes three,
And three becomes four

02:19.873 --> 02:21.407
And the darkness disappears

02:21.474 --> 02:25.378
When you're tired and exhausted,
Lean on me

02:25.445 --> 02:30.183
-Lean on me
-I will always be by your side

02:30.250 --> 02:35.755
-By your side
-So that you never feel like you're alone

02:35.822 --> 02:40.193
I'll be right beside you,
Holding your hand

02:40.293 --> 02:44.764
When you're tired and exhausted,
Lean on me

02:44.831 --> 02:50.069
I will always be by your side

02:50.136 --> 02:54.874
So that you never feel like you're alone

02:54.941 --> 02:59.112
I'll be right beside you,
Holding your hand

03:18.598 --> 03:19.933
Thank you for coming back.

03:49.028 --> 03:53.399
I:dn, Korea's top teen idol band,
has announced a breakup.

03:53.466 --> 03:56.603
To support HershE's decision,
I:dn is now breaking up as well.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.305
In addition to HershE
and I:dn's shocking breakups,

03:59.372 --> 04:02.575
the Super Idol Audition
underway at Kirin Art School

04:02.642 --> 04:04.611
is the talk of the town.

04:05.044 --> 04:08.748
All members of I:dn and HershE
will work on improving ourselves,

04:09.315 --> 04:13.386
and we promise that all five of us
will someday return to you.

04:13.453 --> 04:17.056
A PROMISE TO FANS
THAT HERSHE AND ID:N WILL RETURN

04:17.624 --> 04:24.330
JB! Si-u! Will you be able
to return to us as super idols?

04:25.665 --> 04:27.834
-What would you like today?
-I'll have...

04:29.068 --> 04:30.370
A cup of coffee and a waffle, please.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.305
-Coffee and a waffle?
-Yes.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.445
Excuse me. Are you...

04:42.282 --> 04:43.216
JIN YU-JIN

04:44.717 --> 04:47.020
This guy is in a heated competition

04:47.086 --> 04:49.922
against the boys of I:dn.
Who is Jin Yu-jin, the super idol?

04:51.891 --> 04:53.693
You're Jin Yu-jin
from Kirin Art School, right?

04:54.661 --> 04:56.763
-It's Jin Yu-jin!
-It's him!

04:56.829 --> 04:58.931
-Can I get your autograph?
-Oh, my gosh!

04:58.998 --> 05:02.302
-Please sign us your autograph!
-Your autograph!

05:02.368 --> 05:06.105
The idols, after announcing
the breakup of their groups,

05:06.205 --> 05:08.975
will compete in the Super Idol Audition
with regular high school students.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.578
The idol team, who won
the Internet video mission,

05:12.645 --> 05:16.783
will be given the advantage to select
partners for the audition's next round.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.886
But the Kirin Art School team,
led by the super idol, Jin Yu-jin,

05:19.986 --> 05:21.921
is no easy opponent.

05:21.988 --> 05:26.826
With one win each, both teams
are gearing up for the next round.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.963
Who will be the second star to join
Jin Yu-jin in the super idol group?

05:31.030 --> 05:32.699
We'll bring you more news
in the next broadcast.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.341
What happened to you,
Super Idol Jin Yu-jin?

05:42.442 --> 05:45.778
They were all over me,
asking for my autograph.

05:45.878 --> 05:49.115
-You must be a star already.
-I don't know.

05:49.649 --> 05:53.019
Only time tells what one's destined to be.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.888
Since the idol team will be
the one to choose partners,

05:56.222 --> 05:57.890
our team must be at a disadvantage.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.927
Let's look on the bright side.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.597
We've always been at a disadvantage.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.533
That's ever since the audition was on.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.303
So let's not get too bothered by it.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.773
What matters is the mission.
Right, Hae-seong?

06:24.150 --> 06:28.788
Look at you.
So, you are a girly girl after all.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.392
Look at those eyes, fiery with jealousy.

06:32.825 --> 06:34.093
It's not like that.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.536
Stop it.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.945
A single punch from you,
and my button came off.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.480
That hurt.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.285
I told you to stop.

07:05.391 --> 07:09.028
In a weird way,
those two make a great couple.

07:09.695 --> 07:10.730
What's so weird about it?

07:11.731 --> 07:13.132
They look great together.

07:14.033 --> 07:19.105
They're both top stars after all.
Plus, there were rumors that they dated.

07:19.572 --> 07:20.973
I don't think those were rumors.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.877
I guess teen idols
only date other teen idols.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.313
That's the reality.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.882
Birds of a feather flock together.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.786
Hae-seong,
don't let it bother you too much.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.157
He got sidetracked,
but now he's back where he used to be.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.994
What's up with all of you?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.998
JB's just a friend, like you guys.

07:51.938 --> 07:52.772
No.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.575
I shouldn't delude myself.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.244
Shin Hae-seong,

07:59.445 --> 08:00.546
get a grip.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.520
ROMANCE IN THE AIR FOR JB AND RIAN AGAIN

08:07.587 --> 08:08.421
IDOL 21

08:08.488 --> 08:10.056
COUNTDOWN TO THE BIRTH
OF A TEEN IDOL COUPLE!

08:10.356 --> 08:11.958
COUNTDOWN TO THE BIRTH
OF A TEEN IDOL COUPLE!

08:12.024 --> 08:14.794
ONSTAGE PDA, LOVE SCANDAL SPREADS

08:14.861 --> 08:19.599
NEW CELEBRITY COUPLE! WILL JB
AND RIAN ADMIT THAT THEY'RE TOGETHER?

08:20.733 --> 08:22.201
JB AND RIAN CAUGHT ON CAMERA

08:25.037 --> 08:27.473
JB AND RIAN COZY UP AGAIN

08:30.376 --> 08:33.179
You're on TV even more often
after disbanding without my consent.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.215
Then the love scandal.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.052
You guys are the most searched on the Web.

08:40.887 --> 08:42.922
I'm a lucky man.

08:44.991 --> 08:50.463
Oz's official stance on you two
is that we don't know anything about it.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.498
However,

08:53.733 --> 08:54.901
you guys should...

08:56.302 --> 08:57.303
stay close.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.372
What do you mean?

08:59.705 --> 09:02.141
Like I said, get along with each other.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.978
Making headlines and being talked about
will bring money and power.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.682
Since Rian missed the last mission,

09:10.116 --> 09:12.184
she's at a disadvantage
and needs some help.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.320
Be there for her, JB.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.327
You said you were one team.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.262
Look out for her.

09:25.998 --> 09:26.899
You really said that?

09:28.668 --> 09:29.669
Thank you.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.973
I'm all done here.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.293
Why are you being like this?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.362
Do I have to spell it out for you?

09:57.730 --> 10:01.634
Rumors about you and Rian are fine,
but with that other girl? No way.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.503
A star...

10:06.472 --> 10:08.007
belongs in the night sky,

10:09.075 --> 10:10.843
not on the pavement in broad daylight.

10:12.211 --> 10:16.248
What's on the pavement?
Dirty, dried-out gum.

10:28.661 --> 10:31.664
We have a commercial shoot
at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

10:33.332 --> 10:36.135
It's been a while we had a shoot together.
Let's do a good job.

10:42.675 --> 10:43.909
Thanks.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.546
When you thanked me for coming back...

10:50.149 --> 10:51.150
It helped me a lot.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.532
-Take it off.
-No.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.969
I knocked off the button, so I'll sew it
back on for you. Take it off.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.371
Just sew it on as is.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.240
Come on. Take the jacket off.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.178
You're so stubborn.

11:19.378 --> 11:22.815
What's the big deal?
You're just sewing one button.

11:23.049 --> 11:27.153
You should have been more careful.
Are you a grade schooler?

11:27.319 --> 11:29.555
The other buttons
look like they're about to fall off.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.892
I told you. My fans...

11:33.693 --> 11:36.362
It was my fans that did this.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.931
We have a world star
in our midst, don't we?

11:40.599 --> 11:42.668
Since you're at it anyway,

11:43.469 --> 11:45.104
why don't you fasten the other ones, too?

11:45.171 --> 11:46.739
They're loose.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.775
I was going to anyway.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.110
Thanks so much.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.756
Oh, wow. Hae-seong.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.992
You're good at sewing.
You might as well get married.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.964
I might not know much,

12:12.465 --> 12:16.635
but I'm an expert at mending socks
and sewing on buttons.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.708
I was a tomboy when I was little.

12:24.243 --> 12:28.514
I was always out and about,
just horsing around.

12:29.348 --> 12:30.983
My socks and buttons were never intact.

12:33.919 --> 12:38.491
Every night, my mom would sew
my buttons back on,

12:39.258 --> 12:41.861
and there was nothing
I liked better than that.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.798
I always stayed next to her
and watched her.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.166
That was a total accident.

13:20.699 --> 13:21.867
Don't misunderstand.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.504
Why did you tilt your head like this?

13:26.238 --> 13:29.441
Are you serious? When did I do that?

13:35.314 --> 13:36.382
Yes, you did.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.527
I hereby announce the next mission.

13:49.528 --> 13:52.198
This mission's theme is "serenade."

13:53.365 --> 13:57.036
Over 90% of the songs
we know are love songs.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.172
Na-na.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.210
You're back.

14:05.377 --> 14:06.545
You are such a cutie pie.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.447
Stop it.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.820
Some songs are about the vague line
between love and friendship.

14:19.091 --> 14:22.428
Others are about the agony
of a secret, one-sided crush.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.683
BY HAE-SEONG

14:44.750 --> 14:47.653
Some songs are about jealousy
caused by love.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.960
With countless love songs
to use as references,

14:55.561 --> 14:57.229
you will prepare a serenade.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.033
That is, through song and dance,
you will reenact

15:01.100 --> 15:02.968
a romantic scene from musicals and films

15:03.402 --> 15:05.938
to portray the love between a couple.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.373
Got it.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.544
They say love knows no borders.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.415
For this mission,
the existing teams will be dismantled.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.319
You will have to pair up
for a serenade performance.

15:21.854 --> 15:26.091
The idol team,
who won the Internet video round,

15:26.458 --> 15:31.096
and Jin Yu-jin, the only super idol
thus far, can choose partners first.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.499
What?

15:33.966 --> 15:36.468
What if I can't find myself a partner?

15:37.102 --> 15:41.473
If you're rejected by the person
you propose to be your partner

15:41.540 --> 15:43.342
or fail to find a partner,

15:43.676 --> 15:46.045
you will be automatically
disqualified from this mission.

15:46.712 --> 15:50.649
Finding the right partner
will be important.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.320
Because above all,
this will be a love song.

15:57.222 --> 16:01.393
Well, Yu-jin, you'll pick a partner
among us, right?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.129
Yes.

16:04.863 --> 16:09.101
Since the idols have first dibs,
what if they pair up among themselves?

16:09.301 --> 16:11.737
Then we'll end up
being disqualified automatically.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.439
Why are you so scared?

16:14.039 --> 16:16.842
Just get one of them
to pick you as a partner.

16:17.443 --> 16:18.310
How so?

16:20.612 --> 16:21.547
Do whatever it takes.

16:35.027 --> 16:38.163
If I made a proposal, would you say yes?

16:38.530 --> 16:40.699
What? A proposal?

16:47.239 --> 16:49.375
This is a serenade mission.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.644
This mission was made for me.

16:55.914 --> 16:56.749
Hang on.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.152
I hear them announcing me
as the winner of this mission.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.420
Good grief.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.223
So, what do you say?

17:05.924 --> 17:08.427
-Let's be partners.
-No, I don't want to.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.769
-Come on.
-No.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.437
-I don't want to.
-Why not?

17:21.774 --> 17:24.443
Let's do the mission together.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.784
Are you serious?

17:37.189 --> 17:38.924
Come on now, Hong-ju.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.300
Stop that.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.250
Good luck.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.261
Perfect!

18:54.633 --> 18:57.536
-Should we pair up?
-I don't think so.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.409
Do you have a partner yet?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.578
No. Not yet.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.681
I knew it.

19:43.282 --> 19:47.119
No one wants to pair up with you
because you're so bad.

19:49.655 --> 19:53.158
I'll be the nice guy and pick you.
I'm a super idol, after all.

19:54.426 --> 19:55.394
I'm fine, thanks.

19:57.796 --> 19:58.630
Hey, now.

19:59.364 --> 20:03.168
I'm offering to help.
Why would you say no?

20:03.335 --> 20:05.437
Shouldn't you thank me?

20:05.804 --> 20:08.907
Shin Hae-seong,
how can you be like this to me?

20:09.675 --> 20:12.444
Let's do the mission together. Come on.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.912
Why are you ignoring me?

20:14.780 --> 20:16.982
What's with you?

20:17.082 --> 20:18.050
I'm talking to you.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.619
-I like you.
-Just do it with me.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.023
I like you.

20:26.091 --> 20:28.360
What are you saying?

20:28.460 --> 20:31.830
Did what I just say sound like
it came from someone who really likes you?

20:34.066 --> 20:34.967
No, right?

20:36.168 --> 20:37.269
That's what I mean.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.939
Women are fundamentally
sensitive creatures.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.143
It's not about the words.
They pick up on sincerity.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.146
Words mean nothing.
Watching from afar won't help either.

20:49.114 --> 20:51.016
You need to be sincere to her.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.919
-Be sincere?
-Be sincere.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.021
Do you want to talk more about it?

20:56.855 --> 20:59.091
Come to the counseling center.

21:10.869 --> 21:11.703
Yes?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.008
He wasted no time.

21:19.745 --> 21:20.879
Mr. Yang, what brings you here?

21:25.584 --> 21:26.518
Why are you sitting down?

21:27.686 --> 21:29.321
Can teachers get counseling?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.124
I have an appointment.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.660
My goodness.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.461
All right. Fine.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.599
So, what is it? That's...

21:46.571 --> 21:49.641
There's something I really love to do,

21:51.043 --> 21:53.378
but whenever I start doing it,
my life takes a turn for the worse.

21:54.279 --> 21:55.547
What am I supposed to do?

21:56.848 --> 21:57.916
What is it?

22:00.519 --> 22:01.453
It's dancing.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.557
Dancing?

22:07.459 --> 22:09.561
The thing is, I'm a great dancer.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.831
But whenever I dance,
my life goes downhill.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.033
My grades were great back in high school
until someone told me

22:15.100 --> 22:16.034
they could make me a star.

22:16.101 --> 22:17.669
Because of that
I couldn't get into college,

22:17.736 --> 22:19.071
and even my girlfriend left me.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.606
I regrouped and became an English teacher,

22:21.907 --> 22:25.344
but then someone said
they would help me release an album.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.611
I was conned out of my savings.

22:27.746 --> 22:30.515
So, I vowed I would never dance again.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.819
Then don't, simple as that.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.422
But if I could just give
the kids some pointers,

22:37.489 --> 22:39.925
I could help them be first-rate.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.094
It's so frustrating
to just sit back and watch them.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.533
So, you want to teach dance?

22:59.177 --> 23:00.846
APPLICATION FOR POSITION CHANGE
OR CANCELLATION

23:01.046 --> 23:03.749
-What's this?
-Application for changing jobs.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.954
I need thorough counseling.

23:09.020 --> 23:13.158
Get your job title changed
so that you can teach dance.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.160
That's what you wanted to hear.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.063
I'm here for counseling.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.403
Do what you want, okay?

23:25.003 --> 23:26.304
You can't fight it anyway.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.006
Go back to dancing.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.643
I'm speaking from experience.

23:40.018 --> 23:41.686
APPLICATION FOR POSITION CHANGE
OR CANCELLATION

23:55.066 --> 23:58.336
Who are you planning to partner up with?

24:00.205 --> 24:01.606
I haven't thought about it yet.

24:04.342 --> 24:06.211
I assumed you would do it with me.

24:07.979 --> 24:12.551
I missed the last mission,
so I have to do well this time.

24:13.585 --> 24:14.619
Won't you help me?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.255
Lots of kids here are good.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.358
Like who?

24:21.760 --> 24:23.795
There's no one here
who is as good as you...

24:26.731 --> 24:30.535
or who would be as perfect
a partner for me.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.885
Have you all found partners?

24:47.252 --> 24:48.887
-Yes.
-Yes.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.531
Today's class is all about connecting
with another person.

25:00.465 --> 25:04.503
You will learn how to become one
with your dance partner

25:04.836 --> 25:08.173
through eye contact,
the exchange of signals,

25:08.240 --> 25:10.675
and the sharing of emotions.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.346
Mr. Yang, please come in.

25:19.117 --> 25:20.051
Hold on.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.889
Mr. Yang is the new dance teacher?

25:25.423 --> 25:27.492
You're an English teacher.

25:29.060 --> 25:32.130
I'm Yang Jin-man, who will be helping you

25:32.597 --> 25:35.467
with your dancing
and choreography as of today.

25:38.770 --> 25:39.771
We're doomed.

25:43.108 --> 25:46.077
Why does my neck feel so stiff?

25:57.255 --> 26:02.761
I'll help you build strong basics
and develop signature moves.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.698
A duet serenade mission
is around the corner, right?

26:08.033 --> 26:10.201
Romantic interactions...

26:11.970 --> 26:13.905
Ms. Hyeon, would you help me?

26:16.608 --> 26:20.879
It's simple. All you have to do
is bend and straighten your knees.

26:22.681 --> 26:23.582
Like this?

26:24.316 --> 26:25.784
This seems familiar.

26:26.484 --> 26:27.519
Music!

27:10.295 --> 27:13.365
Why didn't my mom have me
take dance lessons when I was young?

27:13.932 --> 27:15.000
Gosh.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.838
I wonder if the kids will do well
without their original teammates.

27:40.025 --> 27:41.226
That was awesome.

27:48.066 --> 27:52.804
Please don't tell us
those were the basic moves.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.749
Mr. Shin.

28:07.152 --> 28:10.455
I think you've made a mistake this time.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.991
A mistake? Did I?

28:13.591 --> 28:16.961
After the last mission,
my students' teamwork improved,

28:17.028 --> 28:18.863
and they finally
started to get comfortable.

28:18.930 --> 28:22.033
But if you mix the teams up,
that only brings confusion.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.368
That was my intention.

28:23.802 --> 28:24.803
Creating confusion.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.005
Pardon?

28:32.143 --> 28:36.314
Can you tell what pens you have there
at a single glance?

28:37.615 --> 28:39.484
If I sift through...

28:40.652 --> 28:43.488
You have to look closely
and sift through them, right?

29:00.305 --> 29:03.842
I've scattered the kids,
so that I can see each of them better.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.813
Do you still think I've made a mistake?

29:10.515 --> 29:13.785
How nice it must be
to be right all the time.

29:19.224 --> 29:20.792
He's the male version of Sugar cube.

29:27.198 --> 29:29.434
That's you? You look so pretty.

29:30.502 --> 29:31.436
This one.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.706
This one?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.908
-This was from about two years ago.
-Really?

29:37.408 --> 29:38.343
It's really pretty.

29:39.377 --> 29:40.845
Oh, my gosh.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.182
What is wrong with him?

29:49.888 --> 29:53.525
Hey, why are you following us
like a puppy?

29:53.591 --> 29:54.659
Do you have something to say?

29:57.362 --> 29:58.897
I happened to be going this way.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.772
-Yes, this one.
-Right.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.174
It's so pretty.

30:14.979 --> 30:15.814
What do you want?

30:16.381 --> 30:17.849
-I need to...
-Yes?

30:18.149 --> 30:20.051
talk to Hae-seong.
Could you give us a second?

30:23.288 --> 30:26.891
No, Sun-dong. I have nothing
to say to him. Let's go.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.326
-Sure.
-But...

30:30.895 --> 30:32.230
Won't you do the duet with me?

30:34.299 --> 30:35.200
Why should I?

30:36.234 --> 30:38.336
Well, I just...

30:39.871 --> 30:40.705
I...

30:43.608 --> 30:46.444
-Hae-seong, your dad's here.
-What?

30:46.744 --> 30:48.646
Really? Mr. Shin is here?

30:53.785 --> 30:55.053
Help yourselves.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.754
-Thank you, sir.
-Enjoy.

31:08.099 --> 31:11.569
JB, do you flirt with every girl you know?

31:11.636 --> 31:12.537
JB AND RIAN COZY UP AGAIN

31:19.644 --> 31:22.046
That's a big misunderstanding.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.650
Loyalty is a virtue, right?

31:27.952 --> 31:31.189
-You'll get indigestion. Have some water.
-Thank you.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.126
It's your fault, Hae-seong.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.195
Keep an eye on your boyfriend.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.433
You're way more sensible
than your sister. You rock, Hae-pung.

31:43.434 --> 31:44.269
Hae-pung!

31:48.306 --> 31:50.208
I know that rumors
come with the territory,

31:50.775 --> 31:53.745
but I don't want Hae-seong getting hurt.

31:54.846 --> 31:59.884
Dad, why would I get hurt?
I don't know what you mean.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.688
My dad's just joking. Don't mind him.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.560
You ate so well when you visited us,
so I made these for you.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.863
-Please enjoy.
-Yes.

32:12.563 --> 32:16.000
How can you eat so well
after cheating on Hae-seong?

32:17.769 --> 32:19.737
If I were you, I would kneel, and--

32:20.471 --> 32:21.606
Be quiet, okay?

32:22.774 --> 32:26.244
Hae-pung, what can I do
to make you like me again?

32:27.779 --> 32:28.780
Let's go do karaoke.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.784
Okay. Let's go when we're done eating.

32:33.117 --> 32:33.985
All right!

32:34.652 --> 32:36.988
Hey, that's kitty mask.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.969
Are they Hae-seong's dad and sister?

32:55.440 --> 32:57.875
What are JB and Yu-jin doing there?

33:00.144 --> 33:02.013
Talk about a complex situation.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.264
She's too old for kids' songs.

33:53.664 --> 33:55.933
-Gosh.
-She is?

34:44.482 --> 34:45.416
Mr. Shin, please.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.536
So, Beanpole, why are you here?

35:06.804 --> 35:12.076
You must not know.
Hae-seong and I are very close.

35:13.010 --> 35:16.848
Really? Hae-seong's never mentioned you.

35:18.449 --> 35:22.086
Wait. Are you the one
who yelled at me on the phone?

35:22.453 --> 35:25.623
Who, me? Who yelled at you?

35:27.391 --> 35:28.860
You must have a crush on her.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.096
That's awfully tough.

35:32.730 --> 35:33.998
It's not like that.

35:34.899 --> 35:38.769
Are you really sure that
Hae-seong's never mentioned me before?

35:39.370 --> 35:40.505
Yes.

36:07.031 --> 36:08.065
Yu-jin?

36:09.100 --> 36:10.635
Will you be joining them
as a special guest?

36:13.104 --> 36:15.139
-Do you have time?
-What?

36:27.185 --> 36:28.352
-Isn't that JB?
-What?

36:28.586 --> 36:31.088
-It's JB!
-We have to take pictures.

36:34.058 --> 36:37.528
-Gosh, he's so hot.
-I know!

36:38.963 --> 36:40.031
Let's follow him.

36:46.470 --> 36:47.305
Thanks.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.907
Have a safe trip back.

36:50.841 --> 36:54.078
If there's anything you'd like to eat,
I'll send it to Hae-seong.

36:54.478 --> 36:55.713
Dad.

36:57.181 --> 36:59.050
I like apples, sir.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.820
The apples you sent
last time were delicious.

37:05.323 --> 37:06.991
Hae-pung, we're cool now, right?

37:07.358 --> 37:10.328
Yes. You're my favorite person
in the world.

37:10.995 --> 37:12.063
What about me?

37:12.363 --> 37:14.999
After Hae-seong and Dad.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.637
I'll take you
to a nice restaurant next time.

37:19.904 --> 37:20.738
Okay.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.140
Let's go.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.777
-Bye.
-Bye.

37:38.522 --> 37:39.357
Hey.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.593
Thank you for today,

37:43.561 --> 37:45.863
but don't do this again.

37:46.964 --> 37:49.867
I'll talk to my dad and Hae-pung.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.904
You don't have to pretend
to be my boyfriend anymore.

37:54.972 --> 37:58.509
Is this because of the news reports
about Rian and me?

37:59.543 --> 38:04.048
It doesn't matter
whether or not the rumor is true.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.823
Why do you like me?

38:17.295 --> 38:20.631
See? You can't give me a single reason.

38:21.832 --> 38:24.535
You don't really like me.

38:26.771 --> 38:30.608
You're just being nice to me as a fan
and that's what's bringing the confusion.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.777
You must be just confused.

38:34.211 --> 38:38.516
It's either that, or you pity me.

38:42.853 --> 38:43.888
That's not true.

38:45.189 --> 38:48.025
In movies, two amazing guys

38:48.326 --> 38:50.394
fall in love with an ordinary girl

38:51.429 --> 38:52.596
and profess their love for her.

38:56.233 --> 38:59.203
But that's just what happens
only in movies.

39:00.571 --> 39:03.874
In reality, an objectively
amazing guy and girl

39:04.809 --> 39:06.944
end up making a great couple...

39:08.746 --> 39:11.282
just like you and Rian.

39:42.012 --> 39:45.116
-Let's see.
-How much longer do I have to stand here?

39:46.083 --> 39:47.351
It won't take long.

39:50.721 --> 39:51.989
This is perfect.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.392
I'll take this,
but one that wasn't on display.

39:54.992 --> 39:58.529
Why are you getting that for me?

39:58.596 --> 40:01.565
-To repay your kindness.
-Repay what?

40:02.633 --> 40:04.502
I'm very precise
about keeping my accounts.

40:05.603 --> 40:06.437
Okay?

40:08.139 --> 40:09.039
Here you go.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.309
This is for taking me to the hospital.

40:13.511 --> 40:16.714
Let's call it even now.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.063
We might get caught in a love scandal.

40:34.965 --> 40:36.767
I thought you enjoyed that.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.572
I thought it was you
who told the reporters about you and JB.

40:42.540 --> 40:43.374
Why would I do that?

40:44.375 --> 40:45.810
Because you like him.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.250
I bet you want people to know

40:54.185 --> 40:55.419
that you two used to be an item.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.724
Then why don't you tell the reporters
that you're seeing Hae-seong?

41:01.492 --> 41:03.894
-You like Shin Hae-seong.
-No way.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.433
It's written on your face.
It's totally obvious.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.635
You always deny it.

41:14.438 --> 41:16.574
Why else would you have gone to Chungju?

41:16.874 --> 41:18.909
Why else would you join her family picnic?

41:21.178 --> 41:24.982
Everyone except you
knows that you like her.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.452
Won't you ask her to be your partner?

41:31.489 --> 41:32.990
You want me to pair up with Hae-seong,

41:33.457 --> 41:35.626
so that you can pair up with JB, right?

41:36.794 --> 41:37.628
Don't misunderstand.

41:38.662 --> 41:43.133
I just want a good grade on this mission.

41:43.968 --> 41:46.203
You're a terrible actress.
It's so obvious you're lying.

41:46.270 --> 41:47.738
I'm not acting.

41:49.073 --> 41:51.642
Why can't you be honest for once?

41:56.947 --> 41:58.782
You're not honest, either.

42:05.122 --> 42:05.956
Jeez.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.660
IS JB CHEATING? ALL MEN ARE THE SAME

42:09.894 --> 42:11.028
THE GIRL WHO STOLE JB'S HEART

42:12.296 --> 42:16.066
It's not true. You know it's not true.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.371
Exercise some restraint.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.540
Even if all the reporters
make it an issue,

42:22.606 --> 42:24.008
you shouldn't do the same.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.486
Darn it.

42:39.256 --> 42:40.925
We have to take JB
out of all the ad campaigns.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.494
A crisis for one person

42:44.862 --> 42:46.530
may be an opportunity for another.

42:48.499 --> 42:49.600
Are you talking about Yu-jin?

42:50.000 --> 42:54.271
He's already a celebrity of sorts,
and he's also a new face.

42:56.106 --> 42:57.808
He might have a greater impact.

43:04.615 --> 43:05.516
This is so good.

43:13.691 --> 43:14.825
Have you chosen a partner?

43:15.125 --> 43:17.161
Yes. My partner is Ailee.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.936
Yu-jin, you haven't paid tuition
over your three years here.

43:27.304 --> 43:31.308
How can you take classes
without paying for them?

43:33.444 --> 43:36.213
No one's been coldhearted enough
to kick out a student for being poor.

43:37.915 --> 43:39.750
I just assumed I had a scholarship.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.019
But I'm coldhearted.

43:43.754 --> 43:46.290
Are you trying to get him expelled
for not paying his tuition?

43:47.191 --> 43:51.528
He can settle the bill.
This will cover three years of tuition.

43:51.595 --> 43:52.429
AD PROPOSAL

43:55.933 --> 43:56.767
No.

44:02.506 --> 44:04.808
You're in no position
to play hardball here.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.477
Who knows?

44:07.277 --> 44:10.214
If you do this and appear on TV,
Hae-seong might like you.

44:12.716 --> 44:13.751
Do you really think so?

44:18.422 --> 44:20.691
AD PROPOSAL

44:23.460 --> 44:24.461
Hae-seong?

44:37.641 --> 44:39.610
Nice to meet you.
I'm a super idol, Jin Yu-jin.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.345
Hello.

44:44.782 --> 44:47.284
-Hello.
-Jin Yu-jin.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.453
Nice to meet you. I'm Jin Yu-jin...

44:51.221 --> 44:52.856
-Hi.
-Hi.

44:57.728 --> 45:00.364
-Focus.
-What?

45:01.665 --> 45:03.534
You're such a rookie.

45:06.336 --> 45:07.171
Wait.

45:09.707 --> 45:10.674
Come on.

45:11.942 --> 45:12.943
Get your act together

45:13.010 --> 45:14.645
-and don't make things difficult for me.
-Okay.

45:14.912 --> 45:16.680
Just follow my lead.

45:17.314 --> 45:19.083
-Got it?
-Yes. Got it.

45:19.149 --> 45:20.417
-Focus.
-Focus.

45:20.517 --> 45:23.320
-Rian, you're up first.
-I have to go.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.756
What about me? Are you leaving?

45:30.861 --> 45:32.096
Is JB not here yet?

45:32.529 --> 45:34.698
He's not doing the shoot.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.434
What do you mean?

45:37.601 --> 45:40.104
You didn't know? He got pulled out
because of the cheating scandal.

45:41.672 --> 45:42.573
Scandal?

45:45.309 --> 45:46.910
IS JB CHEATING? ALL MEN ARE THE SAME

45:46.977 --> 45:48.278
GIRL IN QUESTION IS HIS CLASSMATE

45:48.746 --> 45:50.814
-Is it JB?
-He's in a scandal?

45:50.881 --> 45:53.050
-Look at that.
-What's JB going to do?

45:54.451 --> 45:56.053
His public image is ruined.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.456
He's never made a mistake like this.

46:00.390 --> 46:05.362
Why is it okay for him to be with Rian
and not Hae-seong?

46:06.697 --> 46:08.932
Is there a law that says
teen idols should only date each other?

46:15.105 --> 46:16.940
What are you going to do
at the broadcasting station?

46:18.275 --> 46:19.510
Don't worry about it.

46:20.344 --> 46:21.245
This is my business.

46:22.012 --> 46:23.347
Will you beat someone up again?

46:26.617 --> 46:29.853
Who will it be this time?

46:31.555 --> 46:32.389
Jin Yu-jin?

46:33.757 --> 46:34.591
Shin Hae-seong?

46:37.861 --> 46:39.096
Do you know why

46:40.364 --> 46:41.965
I came up with the Super Idol Audition?

46:43.934 --> 46:45.636
Do you know why

46:47.104 --> 46:49.106
I brought all of you here to Kirin?

46:51.575 --> 46:52.776
You said you wanted to go solo.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.980
You said you wanted to soar.

46:59.082 --> 47:00.818
The super idol group was designed for you.

47:00.884 --> 47:02.052
Then what about Jin Yu-jin?

47:03.120 --> 47:05.155
Why did you pick him as a super idol?

47:06.623 --> 47:08.091
Jin Yu-jin is a pacemaker.

47:12.296 --> 47:14.164
He was picked to serve as your pacemaker.

47:15.365 --> 47:19.436
Along with HershE and Si-u,
you were resting on your laurels.

47:20.571 --> 47:23.073
He was chosen as a pacemaker
to motivate you to soar higher.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.344
Everything will be fine

47:29.379 --> 47:32.749
as long as you pick
Rian as your duet partner.

47:34.785 --> 47:38.789
That's how you can quell those rumors.

47:42.326 --> 47:43.493
This is for your sake.

47:45.696 --> 47:50.300
A single smart decision
will put everything back on track.

47:51.702 --> 47:52.536
What if...

47:55.072 --> 47:58.508
If I don't, what then?

47:59.543 --> 48:03.580
Getting to the top takes time and effort,
but the slide down doesn't.

48:05.482 --> 48:09.887
You'll sink even lower
than where you started.

48:11.989 --> 48:14.057
It will be very difficult for you
to make your way up again.

48:38.215 --> 48:39.116
Are you okay?

48:41.618 --> 48:43.654
I'll set the record straight.

48:45.789 --> 48:48.625
I'll tell everyone
that the rumor is not true.

49:10.414 --> 49:12.616
It may be an exciting experience for you,

49:13.750 --> 49:15.585
but it could ruin JB's career.

49:17.654 --> 49:18.989
This is just the beginning.

49:21.258 --> 49:22.793
A single scandal...

49:24.861 --> 49:26.196
can end a celebrity's career for good.

49:28.999 --> 49:30.667
JB is softhearted.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.071
It will be very tough on him.

49:36.473 --> 49:39.109
You don't have to worry.

49:40.777 --> 49:44.381
-JB doesn't like me.
-That doesn't matter.

49:45.582 --> 49:49.119
What matters is what the public thinks.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.390
Even if JB asks you to be his partner...

49:56.193 --> 49:57.227
you have to turn him down.

49:59.129 --> 50:03.533
Is that really in JB's best interest?

50:04.801 --> 50:06.370
You still don't trust me?

50:09.239 --> 50:10.207
I don't blame you.

50:11.842 --> 50:12.809
But this is a favor...

50:16.480 --> 50:19.983
I'm asking you as a friend.

50:21.385 --> 50:22.319
As a friend?

50:25.989 --> 50:29.292
So, now we're friends.

50:38.135 --> 50:38.969
One more time.

50:43.173 --> 50:44.007
One more.

50:49.913 --> 50:51.114
Just like that.

50:54.418 --> 50:56.553
Where is this girl?
She said she would help me.

51:01.224 --> 51:04.061
I'm sorry, but may I use this?

51:15.439 --> 51:16.273
Good.

51:18.508 --> 51:19.376
Awesome.

51:24.948 --> 51:25.982
Nice.

51:27.384 --> 51:28.218
Yes.

51:39.396 --> 51:40.263
Good job.

51:42.532 --> 51:43.633
Good job.

51:48.939 --> 51:52.242
Thank you. I'm Jin Yu-jin, a super idol.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.745
-You did great today.
-Thank you, sir.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.148
-See you next time.
-Okay. Thank you.

51:58.215 --> 51:59.683
-Good job.
-Thanks.

52:06.723 --> 52:08.892
GIRL IN QUESTION IS NOT RIAN,
BUT A CLASSMATE

52:13.230 --> 52:15.799
FANS ANGERED BY IDOL'S TWO-TIMING,
JB CAUGHT DATING IN PUBLIC

54:18.922 --> 54:24.527
JB! I'M YOURS!

55:52.482 --> 55:54.317
You look great today.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.523
-I'm so worried.
-Good grief.

56:36.659 --> 56:37.494
Looks good.

57:02.719 --> 57:04.854
Hae-seong! You're so pretty.

57:13.430 --> 57:14.497
Here.

57:21.137 --> 57:22.205
See you later.

57:25.842 --> 57:27.410
You haven't forgotten
what I told you, right?

57:35.118 --> 57:36.519
It's for JB.

57:38.354 --> 57:39.456
Not for me.

57:46.796 --> 57:47.997
Hey.

57:54.737 --> 57:56.039
Where's the man of the hour?

57:56.606 --> 57:57.607
Who are you talking about?

57:59.309 --> 58:01.945
The reporters and audience
are all waiting to see JB.

58:07.784 --> 58:09.018
Are you all ready?

58:12.789 --> 58:13.923
Is JB not here yet?

58:17.894 --> 58:19.462
Who knows where he is?

58:22.098 --> 58:24.200
Why do I get the feeling he won't be here?

58:29.038 --> 58:31.241
He'll be disqualified
if he doesn't show up.

58:50.460 --> 58:51.561
Serenade.

58:52.662 --> 58:54.297
A romantic word, isn't it?

58:55.965 --> 58:58.268
Before next week's main mission,

58:58.668 --> 59:00.270
the students will formally ask

59:00.336 --> 59:03.206
their people of choice
to be their partners.

59:05.475 --> 59:08.077
It's like the sweet moment
of a love confession.

59:08.678 --> 59:11.281
But there's not always a happy ending.

59:12.782 --> 59:15.051
For some, it's love fulfilled,

59:15.852 --> 59:18.888
but for others, it's love rejected.

59:49.285 --> 59:51.988
JB, sing a song.

59:59.662 --> 1:00:02.098
Sing a song that comes from your soul.

1:00:07.704 --> 1:00:09.238
Is this the best you've got?

1:00:15.979 --> 1:00:18.615
Don't be such a loser,
hiding and running away.

1:00:19.749 --> 1:00:21.317
I know you're embarrassed.

1:00:22.185 --> 1:00:24.220
I won't tell anyone.

1:00:25.421 --> 1:00:27.190
So let's go now, loser.

1:00:28.091 --> 1:00:28.925
"Loser"?

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:33.029
A loser takes cover
without considering other people.

1:00:34.030 --> 1:00:35.331
What about Hae-seong?

1:00:36.165 --> 1:00:39.969
Think of how that rumor
will affect Hae-seong.

1:00:40.937 --> 1:00:42.639
-Hae-seong is--
-And also,

1:00:43.573 --> 1:00:46.376
since you're the one who challenged me
in the first place,

1:00:47.944 --> 1:00:50.813
I'm not going to let my pride
tolerate your taking cover.

1:00:52.882 --> 1:00:56.052
It won't count
if you get down on your knees right here.

1:00:59.956 --> 1:01:00.990
Kneel onstage.

1:01:09.265 --> 1:01:12.769
It will be better for you if I'm gone.
It'll help you win.

1:01:16.606 --> 1:01:18.374
So, why are you doing this?

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:21.644
Why? Does that even matter?

1:01:23.513 --> 1:01:24.681
There's no reason.

1:01:25.314 --> 1:01:26.249
All I want is...

1:01:27.450 --> 1:01:29.452
to see you kneel. Fair and square.

1:01:31.888 --> 1:01:32.722
No reason?

1:01:35.525 --> 1:01:36.592
There's no reason...

1:01:37.727 --> 1:01:39.062
What are you mumbling?

1:01:40.863 --> 1:01:43.666
You won't regret this, right?

1:01:45.034 --> 1:01:46.169
Because you'll lose to me.

1:01:47.403 --> 1:01:48.638
That's more like you.

1:01:49.272 --> 1:01:50.807
You're so fickle.

1:01:56.145 --> 1:02:01.384
Please take the stage
and select your partner.

1:02:21.904 --> 1:02:24.907
Aren't the kids beautiful?

1:02:25.675 --> 1:02:29.145
-If I wore a dress--
-A dress?

1:02:30.546 --> 1:02:34.117
Ms. Hyeon was amazing in dresses
back in her Cream Puff days.

1:02:35.451 --> 1:02:37.820
That's all in the past.

1:02:37.954 --> 1:02:41.290
I think she's developed
a bit of a beer belly.

1:02:44.460 --> 1:02:48.498
I would be mistaken for a student
if I took the stage right now,

1:02:48.631 --> 1:02:50.500
wearing a dress.

1:02:50.733 --> 1:02:54.670
-Good grief.
-I would love to see you in a dress.

1:03:48.791 --> 1:03:54.230
-Say yes!
-Say yes!

1:04:04.574 --> 1:04:07.777
Now, we only have two people
who are without partners.

1:04:08.511 --> 1:04:11.714
JB and Jin Yu-jin aren't here yet.

1:04:12.648 --> 1:04:14.717
So, would you two,
Rian and Shin Hae-seong,

1:04:16.118 --> 1:04:18.855
like to be partners?

1:05:12.675 --> 1:05:15.478
I've been hesitating to say this,

1:05:18.114 --> 1:05:19.215
but I won't hold back anymore.

1:05:20.650 --> 1:05:21.517
Hae-seong.

1:05:23.653 --> 1:05:24.620
I like you.

1:05:27.623 --> 1:05:28.524
Why?

1:05:30.559 --> 1:05:31.627
There's no reason.

1:05:33.329 --> 1:05:36.098
I couldn't think of a reason
no matter how much I tried.

1:05:40.569 --> 1:05:44.006
It's just like how I can't explain
why I like music so much

1:05:45.408 --> 1:05:46.676
and why I wanted to become a singer.

1:05:50.212 --> 1:05:51.480
I just like you.

1:05:55.651 --> 1:05:57.420
I would like to sing with you.

1:05:59.522 --> 1:06:01.023
I want to take the stage with you

1:06:02.758 --> 1:06:04.360
and sing with you.

1:06:23.279 --> 1:06:24.246
Shin Hae-seong.

1:06:25.214 --> 1:06:28.317
Will you accept JB as your partner?

1:06:42.231 --> 1:06:43.065
Say no...
