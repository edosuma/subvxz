<i>Joseph Damba was selling
arms to Issouf Al Moctar.</i>

00:02.948 --> 00:05.224
- <i>There's evidence.</i>
- <i>She has Damba on tape?</i>

00:05.244 --> 00:07.495
Aicha has copies, text messages.

00:07.515 --> 00:08.535
<i>The interpreter...</i>

00:08.555 --> 00:09.635
was she wounded?

00:09.655 --> 00:11.535
<i>They killed one of my
soldiers, Corporal Keita,</i>

00:11.555 --> 00:13.595
<i>and then they took her.
They know what she knows.</i>

00:13.615 --> 00:15.535
<i>If word gets
out that Aicha's alive,</i>

00:15.555 --> 00:18.435
people start asking questions,
and where does that leave us?

00:18.455 --> 00:20.495
<i>If I know Aicha,
she will not leave this city</i>

00:20.515 --> 00:22.545
<i>without her brother
and her sister.</i>

00:22.565 --> 00:24.445
<i>You find those kids,
we give you the evidence,</i>

00:24.465 --> 00:26.505
and you decide for yourself.

00:26.525 --> 00:28.425
- Ooh, oh!
- Where are those children?

00:28.445 --> 00:30.565
<i>I'll be
requesting the agency turn over all</i>

00:30.585 --> 00:32.445
and any unseen intelligence
on the interpreter

00:32.465 --> 00:33.595
to the committee.

00:33.615 --> 00:34.605
We need alignment.

00:34.625 --> 00:37.405
Just wind your neck in a little.

00:37.425 --> 00:38.525
I won't be standing
for reelection.

00:38.545 --> 00:41.575
<i>She's controllable.
Damba has me nervous.</i>

kill him, you bastard.

George...

02:07.575 --> 02:10.615
Said, it's them.

I can't.

04:44.635 --> 04:47.475
We do one each.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.625
I do the boy.

04:55.585 --> 04:58.435
Come.

04:58.455 --> 05:00.485
Sit. Sit there.

05:50.495 --> 05:51.565
Sonata?

05:54.615 --> 05:56.445
Hey!

05:56.465 --> 05:58.645
- Where are the guards?
- They left.

06:00.515 --> 06:03.415
They couldn't
go through with it.

06:03.435 --> 06:05.615
With what?

06:12.425 --> 06:14.575
- It's her.
- Hello?

06:14.595 --> 06:16.615
<i>I, uh, have them.</i>

06:16.635 --> 06:18.605
Come to my house, hmm?

06:18.625 --> 06:20.535
Put them on the phone.

06:22.625 --> 06:25.415
Here, Seydou. Here.

06:25.435 --> 06:26.555
Here, talk to the lady.

06:30.585 --> 06:31.575
Hello?

06:31.595 --> 06:35.415
- Seydou?
- <i>Who's this?</i>

06:35.435 --> 06:38.585
It's me, you idiot.

06:38.605 --> 06:40.425
Are you okay?

06:40.445 --> 06:41.615
<i>Did they hurt you?</i>

06:41.635 --> 06:43.605
Aicha?

06:43.625 --> 06:45.455
Seydou, it...

06:45.475 --> 06:47.415
<i>it's so good
to hear your voice.</i>

06:47.435 --> 06:48.605
- Aicha.
- Aicha...

06:48.625 --> 06:51.485
Aicha?

06:51.505 --> 06:52.525
<i>Sonata!</i>

06:52.545 --> 06:54.465
They said you were dead.

06:54.485 --> 06:56.615
Me? Oh. I'm invincible.

06:56.635 --> 06:58.475
Are you okay?

06:58.495 --> 07:00.475
Where are you?

07:00.495 --> 07:02.475
Hey, hey.

07:02.495 --> 07:04.415
Look, here's my address.

07:04.435 --> 07:05.625
- <i>Come to my house.</i>
- Okay, I...

07:07.455 --> 07:08.595
We shouldn't go to her house.

07:08.615 --> 07:10.495
She's got my brother and sister.

07:10.515 --> 07:11.595
Yeah, the perfect bait.

07:11.615 --> 07:13.575
If you go there,
she's got everything she wants:

07:13.595 --> 07:15.505
you and the evidence.

07:15.525 --> 07:16.635
I'll risk it.

07:16.655 --> 07:18.625
Aicha, we'll get them back.

07:18.645 --> 07:22.535
All I'm saying...
let's do this on our terms.

07:24.495 --> 07:26.565
Where's the recording of Damba?

08:01.495 --> 08:03.545
Oh, shit.

08:17.645 --> 08:19.425
I just, uh...

08:20.535 --> 08:23.475
I just had the most
terrible dream.

08:24.535 --> 08:27.545
I threw away my entire career.

08:30.495 --> 08:33.495
- What the fuck did I do?
- I have no idea.

08:33.515 --> 08:36.525
- Oh...
- You didn't think to mention it to me?

08:36.544 --> 08:39.434
Not a word.

08:39.455 --> 08:41.595
How long were you planning this?

08:41.615 --> 08:45.425
I wasn't.

08:45.445 --> 08:48.535
Oh, God.

08:48.555 --> 08:51.435
You know what my mom
used to say?

08:51.455 --> 08:54.555
"Today's pain
is tomorrow's triumph."

08:57.625 --> 09:00.525
Feels like that should be
the other way around.

09:00.545 --> 09:03.535
"Yesterday's triumph

09:03.555 --> 09:04.635
is today's pain."

09:07.465 --> 09:09.535
- Morning, Jess.
- Your office mail.

09:09.555 --> 09:11.425
Help yourself to some co...

09:11.445 --> 09:12.505
Have you seen the press?

09:12.525 --> 09:16.445
Unanimous verdict:
you're out of your mind.

09:16.465 --> 09:18.415
- Any positives?
- Some fringe lunatics

09:18.435 --> 09:20.495
who want to burn down
the Republic

09:20.515 --> 09:21.615
are proclaiming you a prophet.

09:23.635 --> 09:27.615
- It felt right in the moment.
- You sound like the president.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.615
This is why you have
a team, Meaghan.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.485
Who are all right now thinking
what the hell

09:31.505 --> 09:33.455
they're gonna be doing
in November.

09:36.555 --> 09:38.525
Can I blame the meds?

09:38.545 --> 09:39.625
You're not on any meds.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.425
You want to change your mind?

09:42.445 --> 09:44.535
Yes.

09:44.555 --> 09:45.625
No, I...

09:47.575 --> 09:50.415
- I don't know.
- Hey.

09:50.435 --> 09:53.425
If a man can come back
from a pussy tape.

09:53.445 --> 09:57.455
Your campaign will now be
all about your mental toughness.

09:57.475 --> 09:59.615
Mental health. We'll find an
issue you're so fired up about,

09:59.635 --> 10:02.585
you're determined to stay
and fight for.

10:02.605 --> 10:05.545
Is this the
extra intel I requested?

10:05.565 --> 10:08.575
- Are you listening?
- I've already had this.

10:08.595 --> 10:11.615
- What do you mean?
- This Mali report... I've already had it.

10:11.635 --> 10:14.545
- What?
- Wait a minute.

10:14.565 --> 10:16.575
Here.

10:16.595 --> 10:20.545
Look. Look, this section
was almost all redacted.

10:20.565 --> 10:24.465
Look at this. This was prepared
by Elliot Taylor.

10:24.485 --> 10:26.635
Maybe this is the missing piece.

10:26.655 --> 10:28.435
Get me on a plane to London.

10:28.455 --> 10:31.435
So I'm guessing that's a no
on changing your mind.

10:31.455 --> 10:32.595
I don't want to be on the inside
pissing out.

10:32.615 --> 10:35.595
I want to be on the outside
pissing in.

10:35.615 --> 10:37.485
- LBJ, right?
- Right.

10:37.505 --> 10:39.415
- He had a dick.
- Yup.

10:39.435 --> 10:41.495
You try pee standing,
you'll ruin your shoes.

10:51.575 --> 10:53.515
Black saloon approaching,

10:53.535 --> 10:54.655
it's unaccompanied.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.605
- Aicha! Aicha!
- Aicha! - Oh!

11:44.585 --> 11:47.475
Let me look at you,
let me look at you.

11:47.495 --> 11:48.605
Recording's on there.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.465
I missed you so much.

11:58.515 --> 12:00.495
Police jeep.
Two of them.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.625
You fucking set us up.

12:04.645 --> 12:06.615
- I-I told no one.
- Let her go.

12:06.635 --> 12:10.455
Get him to hand them over,
because I'm not fucking joking.

12:10.475 --> 12:12.465
Hand them over!

12:14.445 --> 12:15.625
Okay, get in the car.
Quick.

12:15.645 --> 12:18.435
Aicha, go, go.
Quickly.

12:49.595 --> 12:52.535
- We're okay, we're okay.
- Throw out your weapons.

12:52.555 --> 12:55.415
- We're okay.
- Out of the car. - Out.

12:55.435 --> 12:56.535
- Show your hands.
- Out!

12:56.555 --> 12:58.605
Hands up!

13:00.555 --> 13:04.425
- You are under arrest for the murder of Corporal Keita.
- Stop! Stop!

13:04.445 --> 13:05.625
These people are
under my protection.

13:05.645 --> 13:07.465
These people
are wanted for murder.

13:07.485 --> 13:08.575
This is Aicha Konaté.

13:08.595 --> 13:10.465
She is a key witness in
a corruption investigation.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.555
If you arrest her,

13:11.575 --> 13:14.475
I will have all of you
on corruption charges.

13:14.495 --> 13:16.445
You know who I am, right?

13:16.465 --> 13:19.425
Take her. Take her.

13:19.445 --> 13:20.545
It is them we want.

13:20.565 --> 13:21.595
Come, inside.

13:54.535 --> 13:57.475
This is for Corporal Keita.

13:57.495 --> 14:00.495
The man you shot and killed.

14:00.515 --> 14:03.485
This is for his family.

14:03.505 --> 14:04.515
This is for his children.

14:19.545 --> 14:21.485
Nobody knew we were
meeting them there.

14:23.505 --> 14:26.445
Maybe they are bugging
the house.

14:26.465 --> 14:27.655
Let's get it swept.

14:37.525 --> 14:39.615
<i>Yeah and we
have, uh, how many Stingers?</i>

14:39.635 --> 14:42.445
<i>Eight. FIM-92s.</i>

14:42.465 --> 14:44.445
<i>You can get them through?</i>

14:44.465 --> 14:47.435
<i>Hmm.
Well, I can get them through the port,</i>

14:47.455 --> 14:50.415
<i>but, uh, can you get them
to Al Moctar?</i>

14:50.435 --> 14:52.495
<i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

14:52.515 --> 14:54.615
Who's the other voice?

14:54.635 --> 14:57.405
I don't know.
I wasn't in the room.

14:57.425 --> 14:58.605
The meeting had finished.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.495
Damba didn't know
the tape was still running?

15:01.515 --> 15:03.525
- No.
- McKAY: Excuse me.

15:03.545 --> 15:05.555
So, we found these.

15:05.575 --> 15:08.455
They're French-made, commonly
used by the gendarmerie.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.575
- One of them was in your car.
- Of course.

15:11.645 --> 15:14.615
Why wouldn't they bug
the anti-corruption minister?

15:14.635 --> 15:17.545
Well, you're-you're
all clean now.

15:24.565 --> 15:26.465
Did you know Bintou?

15:26.485 --> 15:28.625
I think we probably been
in the same room

15:28.645 --> 15:31.615
once or... twice.

15:31.635 --> 15:33.655
She loved working for you.

15:35.475 --> 15:37.525
Thought she was
going to make a difference.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.505
I should have never
taken this to her.

15:41.525 --> 15:45.505
I promise you,
if it is within my power...

15:45.525 --> 15:48.495
I will find the people
who killed her.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.655
I don't care about the people
who killed her.

15:52.595 --> 15:54.575
It's the people who ordered it.

15:58.645 --> 16:01.565
You know, it's likely
it was Damba. Hmm?

16:03.445 --> 16:04.595
He's already dead.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.605
You know it doesn't stop there.

16:12.485 --> 16:14.445
You never told me

16:14.465 --> 16:17.435
how you ended up with Al Moctar.

16:17.455 --> 16:19.635
Harry and Leyla recruited me
to translate for them.

16:19.655 --> 16:22.435
And they were
leading the mission?

16:22.455 --> 16:25.475
No, it was some guy
called Miller.

16:25.495 --> 16:27.635
Nathan Miller?

16:27.655 --> 16:29.555
Yeah.

16:29.575 --> 16:31.475
Why?

16:31.495 --> 16:32.595
You know him?

16:44.535 --> 16:46.525
You looking for company?

16:46.545 --> 16:49.505
No offense, but I'm okay.

16:50.585 --> 16:52.425
Thank you.

16:58.645 --> 17:02.405
Last drink before I pack up.
Care to join me?

17:02.425 --> 17:04.484
Clark and Toumi have just been
picked up by local police.

17:04.505 --> 17:06.605
They're gonna be charged
with the death of that soldier.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.525
And Aicha, right now,
is with Sissoko.

17:12.545 --> 17:15.405
You seem remarkably calm.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.464
Well, even if Aicha goes public
with what she has,

17:17.484 --> 17:19.484
it still doesn't
come back to us.

17:19.505 --> 17:20.615
Damba's gone.

17:20.635 --> 17:22.555
Trail ends with him.

17:23.645 --> 17:27.535
- What about Clarke and Toumi?
- They're civilians.

17:27.555 --> 17:29.565
They were here
helping out a friend,

17:29.585 --> 17:31.485
then they broke the law.

17:31.505 --> 17:34.495
- Let them rot.
- If we get involved,

17:34.515 --> 17:36.515
it's only gonna
complicate matters.

17:40.585 --> 17:42.635
I might have that drink.

17:42.655 --> 17:45.595
One more of those, please.

18:00.595 --> 18:02.555
You know, every Friday night...

18:04.605 --> 18:07.605
...my old man would come home
smelling of cheap perfume.

18:09.565 --> 18:11.585
It's one of my earliest
memories.

18:14.655 --> 18:18.475
Later, I... I figured out
that he would

18:18.495 --> 18:20.455
go to this massage parlor

18:20.475 --> 18:22.535
over on Franklin.

18:22.555 --> 18:24.585
Every Friday.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.615
Same time.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.495
Did your mom know?

18:28.515 --> 18:29.575
Thanks.

18:31.575 --> 18:32.635
I don't know how she couldn't.

18:32.655 --> 18:34.465
He didn't try to hide it.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.545
But she never said a word.

18:42.445 --> 18:44.655
I confronted him once,
when he was older.

18:46.435 --> 18:47.585
He hit me.

18:50.455 --> 18:52.425
70 years old.

18:52.445 --> 18:54.655
He could still pack a punch.

18:56.655 --> 18:59.515
Quite a story.

19:04.535 --> 19:05.635
What time's our flight?

19:08.535 --> 19:11.485
You're not leaving, Amanda.

19:11.505 --> 19:13.435
What?

19:13.455 --> 19:15.505
I thought you spoke to Kingsley.

19:15.525 --> 19:17.425
He wants you to be
our eyes on the ground

19:17.445 --> 19:19.615
when the troops roll in.

19:22.655 --> 19:25.515
But you are leaving.

19:25.535 --> 19:28.445
He wants me back in D.C.

19:54.505 --> 19:57.405
What, have you come to gloat?

19:57.425 --> 19:59.565
This wasn't me.

19:59.585 --> 20:01.445
If anyone lays
another finger on you,

20:01.465 --> 20:03.575
they will find themselves in one
of their own cells.

20:03.595 --> 20:05.625
What did you do with Aicha?

20:07.455 --> 20:09.565
Right now she's at my house
having something to eat.

20:09.585 --> 20:12.415
She's worried about you,
but apart from that, she's...

20:12.435 --> 20:14.425
she's all right, she's fine.

20:16.595 --> 20:19.615
Tell me about this mission
in the north two years ago.

20:21.565 --> 20:23.455
Don't know what you're
talking about.

20:23.475 --> 20:25.465
The president is my friend.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.615
Maybe I can get you out of here,

20:27.635 --> 20:30.535
even though you put a gun
to my head.

20:31.645 --> 20:33.495
So...

20:33.515 --> 20:35.525
what do you know
about Nathan Miller?

20:35.545 --> 20:37.495
Miller?

20:37.515 --> 20:40.405
What is his relationship
with Al Moctar?

20:40.425 --> 20:43.475
Why do you want to know about
Nathan Miller?

20:45.465 --> 20:47.445
He's here, isn't he?

20:47.465 --> 20:48.535
He's in Mali?

20:48.555 --> 20:51.565
Is he involved
in the troop deal?

20:54.555 --> 20:58.495
Tell me what you know
and I'll get you out of here.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.565
Mr. President.

21:17.585 --> 21:20.635
Isn't this terrible?

21:20.655 --> 21:24.425
I know you and Damba
didn't always see eye to eye,

21:24.445 --> 21:28.455
but I know
you had respect for him.

21:28.475 --> 21:31.585
Can we talk alone, please?

21:31.605 --> 21:34.555
<i>Yeah, and we
have, uh, how many Stingers?</i>

21:34.575 --> 21:36.555
<i>Eight. FIM-92s.</i>

21:36.575 --> 21:39.425
<i>You can get them through?</i>

21:39.445 --> 21:41.515
<i>Hmm.
Well, I can get them through the port,</i>

21:41.535 --> 21:44.465
<i>but, uh, can you get them
to Al Moctar?</i>

21:44.485 --> 21:45.625
<i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

21:51.455 --> 21:53.575
To think I was shedding tears
for that bastard.

21:57.625 --> 22:00.405
Miller was here.

22:00.425 --> 22:02.515
Two years ago,
leading an intel mission.

22:02.535 --> 22:04.625
He met Al Moctar.

22:04.645 --> 22:07.535
Maybe he was working with Damba.

22:07.555 --> 22:09.595
The U.S. has wanted
a base here for years.

22:09.615 --> 22:12.655
A new foothold in Africa.

22:14.455 --> 22:16.445
Souleymane.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.445
The troop deal.

22:18.465 --> 22:20.605
They are playing you.

22:31.425 --> 22:33.565
- Amanda?
- Yeah.

22:35.545 --> 22:37.495
Turn on the TV.

22:41.575 --> 22:43.565
<i>We have to ask ourselves,</i>

22:43.585 --> 22:46.485
<i>when our country
is under attack,</i>

22:46.505 --> 22:48.435
<i>who can best defend it?</i>

22:48.455 --> 22:51.485
<i>Troops familiar with the
terrain and the people of Mali?</i>

22:51.505 --> 22:54.565
<i>Or forces from thousands
of miles away,</i>

22:54.585 --> 22:58.405
<i>who present a target
and bring conflict</i>

22:58.425 --> 22:59.495
<i>into our capital itself?</i>

22:59.515 --> 23:00.575
The fuck is he talking about?

23:00.595 --> 23:03.615
- Us.
- <i>I have spoken this morning...</i>

23:03.635 --> 23:05.585
He's not signing the deal.

23:05.605 --> 23:09.455
You got to be kidding me.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.635
This was in the bag.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.545
What the fuck happened?!

23:21.635 --> 23:23.615
The palace is on lockdown.

23:23.635 --> 23:26.405
Yes, I-I understand that.
We were here earlier.

23:26.425 --> 23:27.535
You were the guy
who let us through.

23:27.555 --> 23:28.605
Nobody goes in.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.415
We were with the president.

23:30.435 --> 23:31.435
We need to talk to him, okay?

23:31.455 --> 23:32.625
Will you just tell him that
it's Nathan Miller

23:32.645 --> 23:34.615
and Amanda Jones?
Again.

23:34.635 --> 23:36.605
Please?

23:36.625 --> 23:39.575
Morning, sir.

23:39.595 --> 23:42.615
Listen, before you say anything,
this is just a temporary delay.

23:42.635 --> 23:44.635
We're at
the presidential palace now.

23:44.655 --> 23:46.635
<i>Is it possible</i>

23:46.655 --> 23:49.455
<i>it's not gonna happen?
Because</i>

23:49.475 --> 23:51.595
from where I'm standing,
it looks like the president

23:51.615 --> 23:53.635
just ruled out the deal.

23:53.655 --> 23:56.435
Okay, it's just
domestic politics.

23:56.455 --> 23:58.415
It's nothing for you
to lose sleep over.

23:58.435 --> 23:59.545
You know what, Nathan?

23:59.565 --> 24:02.535
I don't sleep much these days.

24:02.555 --> 24:04.465
You bring this in

24:04.485 --> 24:06.415
or I'll cut you loose.

24:06.435 --> 24:07.625
And then maybe you'll be safer

24:07.645 --> 24:10.595
staying in Mali.

24:13.445 --> 24:15.555
I need to find out why
this fucking deal is stalled.

25:49.445 --> 25:51.455
George, pace yourself.

25:53.515 --> 25:55.625
This is the head

25:55.645 --> 25:58.425
of every Whitehall mandarin

25:58.445 --> 26:00.545
dithering over the ransom.

26:02.515 --> 26:04.425
Weighing up whether
it reflects badly on them.

26:04.445 --> 26:05.565
Or...

26:07.435 --> 26:08.495
...not thinking about it at all.

26:08.515 --> 26:12.455
But looking at porn
on their fucking phone.

26:12.475 --> 26:15.425
Instead of doing
their fucking job

26:15.445 --> 26:17.595
and getting my people
out of here.

26:29.655 --> 26:32.445
I ever tell you about Khaladiya?

26:34.475 --> 26:36.495
If this is gonna be
a stiff upper lip story,

26:36.515 --> 26:39.445
really, I'm not in the mood.

26:42.645 --> 26:45.495
We were reinforcing a platoon,

26:45.515 --> 26:48.445
taking on an insurgent position
on the edge of town.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.505
Two armored personnel carriers.

26:53.605 --> 26:57.585
Damn things didn't run
in 35 degrees, let alone 50.

26:57.605 --> 27:00.495
Only, this day...

27:00.515 --> 27:02.495
it was hotter than usual.

27:04.445 --> 27:06.505
The lead vehicle just stopped.

27:06.525 --> 27:09.475
Worst possible spot.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.505
Middle of the fucking avenue.

27:11.525 --> 27:13.635
Snipers on every balcony.

27:13.655 --> 27:16.625
We asked for permission
to withdraw.

27:16.645 --> 27:20.525
You know what they said?

27:20.545 --> 27:23.615
Not unless you bring back
that other APC.

27:25.455 --> 27:27.485
You know who came to our rescue?

27:30.565 --> 27:32.515
Mount Rock.

27:32.535 --> 27:35.505
Private sector.

27:35.525 --> 27:37.565
State of the art equipment.

27:44.465 --> 27:47.435
I know people...

27:47.455 --> 27:49.585
who can get us
out of here, George.

27:53.475 --> 27:55.595
But if they do,
nobody can ever know about it.

28:50.555 --> 28:52.495
Let's get you out of here.

29:15.435 --> 29:19.425
There is something seriously
wrong in Mali

29:19.445 --> 29:21.415
when the anti-corruption
minister

29:21.435 --> 29:23.635
is springing the foreign killers

29:23.655 --> 29:26.495
of a Malian soldier from jail.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.615
I have the president's authority

29:28.635 --> 29:31.425
to take these two friends
of our government

29:31.445 --> 29:34.425
to a place of safety.

29:34.445 --> 29:35.595
This is an order to release

29:35.615 --> 29:37.625
these prisoners
from police custody.

29:37.645 --> 29:40.425
We are the army.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.625
I am well aware
of that, General.

29:42.645 --> 29:45.425
Then, Madam, you will be aware

29:45.445 --> 29:47.435
that these people
have killed one of my men.

29:47.455 --> 29:49.465
And consequently, this now falls

29:49.485 --> 29:51.545
under my jurisdiction.

30:00.535 --> 30:02.555
Now, if President Diabate

30:02.575 --> 30:04.585
has got a problem with this,

30:04.605 --> 30:07.595
tell him he can
take it up with me.

31:16.635 --> 31:19.435
Harry, are you okay?

31:24.545 --> 31:26.455
Not okay.

31:36.625 --> 31:39.595
I should have
just left you alone.

31:41.635 --> 31:44.405
I'm sorry.

31:47.625 --> 31:51.425
You didn't...
drag me into this, Leyla.

31:55.585 --> 31:57.435
It was my choice.

32:07.445 --> 32:10.425
Do you remember that day
on the beach in Skye?

32:12.475 --> 32:14.455
You made me get in the sea.

32:19.525 --> 32:21.585
Thought I was gonna die of cold.

32:23.635 --> 32:26.545
Yet you were only in
for about five seconds.

32:32.485 --> 32:34.455
I should never have left you.

32:38.525 --> 32:39.605
I woke up...

32:41.545 --> 32:42.655
...and you were gone.

32:45.455 --> 32:46.615
No phone call.

32:48.635 --> 32:50.595
Nothing.

32:51.625 --> 32:53.615
Just like my dad.

33:05.495 --> 33:08.555
You were my one good thing
and I fucked it up.

33:13.495 --> 33:15.435
Hey.

33:16.655 --> 33:19.645
Don't beat yourself up about it.

33:30.495 --> 33:31.645
Take me back...

33:35.425 --> 33:36.575
...to that beach.

33:53.475 --> 33:54.565
Elliot Taylor?

33:54.585 --> 33:56.615
Meaghan Sullivan.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.565
I already told you.
I have nothing to say.

33:59.585 --> 34:03.485
I've just flown all the way
here from Washington.

34:17.585 --> 34:19.465
You can't be in here.

34:19.485 --> 34:22.645
Will you just look at this
report on your Mali debrief?

34:25.435 --> 34:27.585
I don't want to subpoena you,
but I will if I have to.

34:27.605 --> 34:29.625
I think you might
have a job with that,

34:29.645 --> 34:32.455
given that you were released
from the Intelligence Committee

34:32.475 --> 34:34.585
three days ago.

34:34.605 --> 34:37.574
How English of you
to be so polite.

34:37.594 --> 34:41.405
I wasn't released.
I was kicked out.

34:41.425 --> 34:43.534
Let me guess.
For being stubborn.

34:43.554 --> 34:44.645
Yeah.

34:47.645 --> 34:49.574
You were released too,
weren't you?

34:51.605 --> 34:54.465
- I resigned.
- Bullshit.

34:54.485 --> 34:55.625
They kicked you out.

34:57.475 --> 35:00.465
Now you talk while a bunch
of kids check their Instafeeds.

35:00.485 --> 35:02.475
They fucked you
just like they fucked me

35:02.495 --> 35:05.455
and they're winning, Elliot.

35:05.475 --> 35:07.495
They're winning.

35:20.445 --> 35:21.545
This is...

35:21.565 --> 35:23.595
just a debrief of the mission.

35:25.605 --> 35:28.505
There's nothing sensitive here.

35:37.605 --> 35:39.485
What?

35:44.495 --> 35:48.475
At Isaac Turner's memorial,
I spoke to his father.

35:48.495 --> 35:51.655
He told me Turner died
in a failed escape.

35:53.495 --> 35:55.515
But I debriefed everyone.

35:55.535 --> 35:57.625
There was no failed escape.

36:00.655 --> 36:02.655
So where'd he get
that idea from?

36:06.525 --> 36:08.625
<i>Thank you for seeing
us, Mr. Turner.</i>

36:08.645 --> 36:11.435
We appreciate it.

36:12.505 --> 36:14.455
My, uh, my nephew

36:14.475 --> 36:16.605
did three tours of Afghanistan.

36:16.625 --> 36:19.405
Must be handy for you.

36:19.425 --> 36:21.555
When it comes to election time.

36:23.625 --> 36:26.635
What war are you wanting
to start now?

36:26.655 --> 36:29.405
Actually, I'm trying
to stop one.

36:29.425 --> 36:30.615
So if I look up
your voting record,

36:30.635 --> 36:33.425
you'll be that rare dove?

36:40.425 --> 36:42.405
Mr. Turner.

36:42.425 --> 36:46.405
At the memorial, you mentioned
a failed escape attempt.

36:46.425 --> 36:47.595
I did.

36:47.615 --> 36:49.605
Where did you hear about that?

36:49.625 --> 36:51.605
George White.

36:51.625 --> 36:54.455
He was right here,
told me all about it. Ask him.

36:54.475 --> 36:56.495
I would, but...

36:56.515 --> 36:59.455
I'm afraid
he's no longer around.

37:01.505 --> 37:05.455
I'm sorry to make you
go through it all again, but...

37:05.475 --> 37:08.545
could you tell us
what happened out there?

37:11.475 --> 37:12.625
So, George White

37:12.645 --> 37:16.415
told Mr. Turner
they didn't escape.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.425
But when you debriefed them,
they told you they did?

37:19.445 --> 37:21.445
Every one of them.

37:21.465 --> 37:23.495
Why would you tell the parents
of a guy that died

37:23.515 --> 37:25.495
that his death achieved nothing
if he actually

37:25.515 --> 37:27.455
helped four colleagues escape?

37:27.475 --> 37:29.425
You wouldn't.
White definitely wouldn't.

37:29.445 --> 37:32.455
So... maybe they never escaped.

37:32.475 --> 37:34.525
Then how did they
get out of there?

37:36.535 --> 37:38.545
Somebody paid a ransom.

37:38.565 --> 37:41.415
Well, it wasn't us.

37:41.435 --> 37:42.615
Well, whoever it was,

37:42.635 --> 37:45.515
maybe that's what they don't
want me finding out.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.555
Hello?

38:27.575 --> 38:29.515
Call Martin Collins.

38:29.535 --> 38:31.435
Tell him to get us out of here.

38:31.455 --> 38:33.475
I'm afraid I can't
speak right now.

38:56.545 --> 38:58.555
You really think
this administration

38:58.575 --> 39:01.525
isn't itching rewrite
the anti-trust laws?

39:03.575 --> 39:06.425
Excuse me.

39:11.425 --> 39:13.445
I need $50 million right away.

39:13.465 --> 39:15.485
You really don't
do foreplay, do you?

39:15.505 --> 39:17.445
It's ransom for Miller.

39:17.465 --> 39:19.455
I didn't think even he
was worth that much.

39:19.475 --> 39:21.445
There's five of them.

39:21.465 --> 39:23.595
<i>Need to ransom all five?</i>

39:23.615 --> 39:25.525
It's what Miller wants.

39:25.545 --> 39:29.485
- How fast can you get this done?
- <i>Assuming Kingsley says yes,</i>

39:29.505 --> 39:30.555
do you have the details?

39:30.575 --> 39:33.485
- A bank account in Guernsey.
- <i>Guernsey.</i>

39:33.505 --> 39:35.635
I thought it was just a herd
of cows on a grassy rock.

39:35.655 --> 39:38.445
Just send the money, Martin.

39:48.465 --> 39:51.415
Sissoko went to see Clarke
and Toumi in prison.

39:51.435 --> 39:53.525
- Before the deal was called off?
- Yes.

40:00.515 --> 40:02.615
I'm going to find Harry Clarke.

40:02.635 --> 40:05.455
See exactly what that
son of a bitch told her.

40:05.475 --> 40:06.615
I thought you didn't want
to drag them into this.

40:06.635 --> 40:08.455
That's when we had a deal.

40:09.635 --> 40:12.455
- You coming?
- I think I might just sit this one out.

40:12.475 --> 40:13.535
Why?

40:13.555 --> 40:17.505
Clarke won't talk if I'm there.
It didn't end well between us.

40:18.515 --> 40:20.475
Okay.

40:44.495 --> 40:45.605
Wow.

40:45.625 --> 40:48.505
- Wow, you look like I feel.
- Jesus.

40:48.525 --> 40:49.635
What the fuck
are you doing here?

40:49.655 --> 40:51.455
I heard you were in trouble.

41:03.615 --> 41:06.455
I guess we couldn't
stay away from Mali, huh?

41:07.535 --> 41:09.565
What's not to love?

41:09.585 --> 41:12.435
Yeah.

41:12.455 --> 41:14.635
I thought we were
up shit creek two years ago.

41:14.655 --> 41:16.555
But this...

41:16.575 --> 41:18.635
how the fuck
did you get into this mess?

41:18.655 --> 41:20.485
Just helping an old friend.

41:20.505 --> 41:22.485
Aicha, right?

41:22.505 --> 41:24.435
No good deed goes unpunished.

41:24.455 --> 41:25.515
What did you tell Sissoko?

41:25.535 --> 41:28.585
What are you doing
in Mali, Nathan?

41:28.605 --> 41:30.425
You know I'm not gonna
tell you that.

41:30.445 --> 41:31.515
Just tell me what you told her

41:31.535 --> 41:32.635
and maybe I can
get you out of here.

41:32.655 --> 41:35.445
Did you know they were
gonna target Aicha?

41:36.565 --> 41:38.435
Did you order it?

41:39.605 --> 41:42.475
- Harry, don't help him!
- Come on, man.

41:42.495 --> 41:45.635
I am offering you a chance
to get out of this hellhole.

41:45.655 --> 41:48.485
What do you want?

41:50.505 --> 41:52.545
I've lost the president's ear.

41:52.565 --> 41:54.485
I just need something
to get it back.

41:54.505 --> 41:56.565
Yeah, we give you what you want,
how do we know you won't

41:56.585 --> 41:58.605
- just leave us here?
- You don't.

41:58.625 --> 42:00.525
But if you don't
give me something,

42:00.545 --> 42:02.415
I am definitely

42:02.435 --> 42:04.625
going to fucking leave you here.

42:10.535 --> 42:11.565
Harry, give me something.

42:13.465 --> 42:14.515
Get us on a fucking plane.

42:25.465 --> 42:26.495
Hey.

42:26.515 --> 42:28.455
Sissoko's the roadblock.

42:28.475 --> 42:30.565
She told the president
I was here two years ago.

42:30.585 --> 42:33.425
Told him about the mission,
Al Moctar, all of it.

42:33.445 --> 42:35.405
<i>It's why he's not signing.</i>

42:35.425 --> 42:36.535
Fuck.

42:36.555 --> 42:38.495
We need to loosen her hold
on the president

42:38.515 --> 42:39.575
and weaken him in the process.

42:39.595 --> 42:41.465
And how do we do that?

42:41.485 --> 42:42.595
We leak the tape

42:42.615 --> 42:44.465
<i>and we frame Sissoko.</i>

42:49.475 --> 42:51.415
<i>Breaking news now,</i>

42:51.435 --> 42:54.455
<i>as a leaked recording
of recently deceased minister</i>

42:54.475 --> 42:57.505
<i>Joseph Damba has come to light.</i>

42:57.525 --> 43:00.505
<i>Yeah, and we
have, uh, how many Stingers?</i>

43:00.525 --> 43:03.565
<i>Eight. FIM-92s.</i>

43:03.585 --> 43:06.455
- <i>You can get them through?</i>
- <i>Hmm.</i>

43:06.475 --> 43:08.635
<i>Well, I can get them
through the port, but, uh,</i>

43:08.655 --> 43:12.405
- <i>can you get them to Al Moctar?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

43:12.425 --> 43:13.595
<i>The tape was leaked from</i>

43:13.615 --> 43:15.585
<i>the office of
Minister Aminata Sissoko,</i>

43:15.605 --> 43:18.495
<i>and concerns are growing
over her role</i>

43:18.515 --> 43:20.625
<i>in the death of Joseph Damba,</i>

43:20.645 --> 43:22.585
<i>killed in a car bomb
earlier this weak.</i>

43:22.605 --> 43:26.495
<i>This reaction
from President Diabate</i>

43:26.515 --> 43:28.555
<i>in the last few minutes.</i>

43:28.575 --> 43:31.585
Like all loyal Malians,
I have been deeply disturbed

43:31.605 --> 43:33.615
by these revelations.

43:33.635 --> 43:36.565
<i>Let me tell you now
that I've asked Madame Sissoko</i>

43:36.585 --> 43:37.615
<i>to leave the cabinet</i>

43:37.635 --> 43:40.425
<i>and to make herself available
to the inquiry</i>

43:40.445 --> 43:42.625
<i>into how it is that members
of Mali's government</i>

43:42.645 --> 43:46.425
<i>have been aiding
and arming our enemies.</i>

43:49.495 --> 43:51.415
<i>In the last 24 hours,</i>

43:51.435 --> 43:52.595
<i>riots have broken out in Bamako</i>

43:52.615 --> 43:56.405
<i>as people take to the streets
in the Malian capital</i>

43:56.425 --> 43:58.545
<i>in protest against the news</i>

43:58.565 --> 44:00.635
<i>that members of
President Diabate's government</i>

44:00.655 --> 44:04.435
<i>have been involved
in selling arms</i>

44:04.455 --> 44:06.525
<i>to the Al Moctar militia.</i>

44:06.545 --> 44:09.435
<i>This violent reaction
to the leaked tape</i>

44:09.455 --> 44:12.485
<i>has forced President Diabate
into a tight corner.</i>

44:12.505 --> 44:16.485
<i>He is now expected to sign
the American troop deal,</i>

44:16.505 --> 44:18.595
<i>widely seen
as a way of shoring up</i>

44:18.615 --> 44:20.645
<i>his faltering government.</i>

44:36.655 --> 44:39.435
You have won, Mr. Miller.

45:08.505 --> 45:10.535
Come in, it's open.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.605
You're starting early.

45:16.625 --> 45:18.615
Drowning my sorrows.

45:18.635 --> 45:21.525
You get to leave.

45:21.545 --> 45:23.425
You want one?

45:23.445 --> 45:25.545
No.
No, no, I'm-I'm okay.

45:25.565 --> 45:27.455
I got to
hand it to you, though...

45:27.475 --> 45:28.525
we got there.

45:28.545 --> 45:30.465
Took a few detours.

45:30.485 --> 45:31.565
Yeah, but we got there.

45:31.585 --> 45:33.455
Yeah.

45:33.475 --> 45:36.415
Yes, we did.

45:36.435 --> 45:39.445
You gonna be okay?

45:39.465 --> 45:41.555
I'll do what has to be done.
That's the job, right?

45:42.655 --> 45:45.495
That is the J-O-B.

45:45.515 --> 45:49.415
What about Clarke and Toumi?

45:49.435 --> 45:50.565
I made a deal.

45:50.585 --> 45:53.485
I see no reason not to keep it.

45:55.515 --> 45:57.445
What?

45:57.465 --> 45:59.545
What if they keep digging?

45:59.565 --> 46:01.575
Well, why would they?

46:01.595 --> 46:03.425
Aicha's safe.

46:03.445 --> 46:05.515
Damba is gone.

46:05.535 --> 46:07.565
They got no skin in the game.

47:01.535 --> 47:04.485
There's a plane waiting
to take you to Dakar.

47:05.615 --> 47:07.625
And from there, to Brize Norton.

47:09.575 --> 47:12.475
Now, if you're smart,
you'll put all this behind you.

47:12.495 --> 47:14.435
Who knows...

47:14.455 --> 47:17.525
maybe one day you'll buy me
a pint of warm beer.

47:17.545 --> 47:19.575
Clean yourself up.

48:28.595 --> 48:31.525
What are you doing?

48:34.655 --> 48:36.535
I have money to spend now.

48:39.425 --> 48:40.525
I need someone
who can speak English.

48:43.535 --> 48:46.445
- It's the language of arms deals.
- Oh, come on, man.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.425
Come on, you can
find somebody else.

48:48.445 --> 48:50.535
That's not what we agreed to.
Just let her go, man.

49:00.575 --> 49:02.585
The deal was I let you escape.

49:02.605 --> 49:04.545
I have.

49:04.565 --> 49:07.455
But without transportation,
you will die.

49:07.475 --> 49:10.555
She is the price
for your transportation.

49:25.605 --> 49:28.475
No!

49:28.495 --> 49:31.445
We are not going without her!

49:31.465 --> 49:33.425
Okay, we are not
going without her!

49:33.445 --> 49:35.595
Leyla, come here.
Come on, come on.

49:35.615 --> 49:37.595
- Please let her go.
- Okay, get in the truck.

49:37.615 --> 49:39.475
I am not leaving without her!

49:39.495 --> 49:42.475
We are not leaving with...

49:42.495 --> 49:45.495
Leyla, get in the fucking truck!

49:45.515 --> 49:47.435
- No!
- Leyla, please.

51:06.525 --> 51:08.595
- Is Aicha okay?
- No.

51:08.615 --> 51:11.455
None of us are okay,
thanks to you.

51:11.475 --> 51:13.535
You have fucked us all.

51:13.555 --> 51:16.435
Welcome to the new Afghanistan.

51:16.455 --> 51:18.465
Only you get to fly out of here

51:18.485 --> 51:20.495
and leave us to the mess
you have created.

51:20.515 --> 51:23.505
I just have to know one thing.
Were you in on it

51:23.525 --> 51:26.605
with Miller and Jones
all along, huh?

51:26.625 --> 51:28.545
What did you say?

51:28.565 --> 51:30.575
Oh, you have played me,
I get that.

51:30.595 --> 51:32.545
I just want to know
for my own sanity.

51:32.565 --> 51:36.425
- Amanda Jones?
- You know what?

51:36.445 --> 51:38.595
I don't know
what I expected from you.

51:54.485 --> 51:56.615
Harry.

51:56.635 --> 51:59.585
She's here.

51:59.605 --> 52:01.615
She's a fucking part of this.

52:01.635 --> 52:03.465
Of course she is.

52:03.485 --> 52:05.455
Let's get on this plane, Harry.

52:06.525 --> 52:08.515
Harry. Please.

52:08.535 --> 52:09.635
Listen to me.

52:09.655 --> 52:11.635
You crawl back under that rock.

52:11.655 --> 52:13.635
I'm gonna crawl under there
with you, okay?

52:13.655 --> 52:17.575
Anywhere you want to go.
Just get on the plane, Harry.

52:20.445 --> 52:21.575
Harry.

52:23.445 --> 52:24.505
Harry!

52:26.545 --> 52:28.435
Harry, what are you doing?
