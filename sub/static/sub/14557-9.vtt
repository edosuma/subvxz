WEBVTT

00:11.712 --> 00:13.447
Hey, kids.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.017
Watch this.

00:17.085 --> 00:20.388
* *

00:31.065 --> 00:31.999
( chuckles )

00:32.066 --> 00:33.267
Not bad.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.702
( gasping )

00:36.504 --> 00:37.671
-Rob...?
-My inhaler...

00:37.738 --> 00:39.340
( coughs )

00:43.144 --> 00:46.114
The damn pollen.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.553
Better?

00:58.492 --> 00:59.627
Rob?

00:59.693 --> 01:00.461
Rob!

01:00.528 --> 01:02.496
Rob, oh, my God!
Boys, call 911.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.032
Rob!

01:05.099 --> 01:06.467
Somebody help me!

01:07.435 --> 01:10.271
( siren wailing )

01:10.338 --> 01:11.772
-Hey.
-MEGAN: Hi.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.507
What do we got?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.376
Rob Evans, 34.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.844
Apparent stroke victim.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.011
What do you
mean-- "apparent"?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.280
The National Institute
of Health

01:19.347 --> 01:20.648
has identified four
unusual seizures

01:20.714 --> 01:22.850
in Los Angeles in
a little over two weeks.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.017
So they called us.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.519
They think it's
product tampering.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.921
All the victims were on
over-the-counter medications

01:27.988 --> 01:29.257
when the seizures struck.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.791
DON:
What do you say, David?

01:30.858 --> 01:31.592
Evening.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.127
NIH identified
the toxin

01:33.194 --> 01:34.395
as Primalect--

01:34.462 --> 01:35.929
an ephedrine-based
pain reliever

01:35.996 --> 01:36.864
known to cause strokes.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.032
All these drugs were poisoned
with a different drug?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.268
Yeah.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.502
That's not even
the scariest part.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.271
It's not the same
product every time.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.105
One occasion
was a nasal spray,

01:45.173 --> 01:46.507
another was
a cough suppressant

01:46.574 --> 01:48.876
and on two occasions
it was an asthma inhaler

01:48.942 --> 01:49.943
called Truften.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.913
So it's random attacks on three
totally different products.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.082
Purchased off the shelf
at four separate pharmacies

01:55.149 --> 01:56.650
across L.A. County.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.686
So no way to do
an effective recall.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.755
Which leaves anyone
needing medication

02:01.822 --> 02:04.392
completely vulnerable
to a maniac.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.235
We all use math every day...

02:14.302 --> 02:16.036
to predict weather...

02:16.103 --> 02:19.039
to tell time...

02:19.106 --> 02:21.775
to handle money...

02:21.842 --> 02:25.779
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

02:25.846 --> 02:26.814
It's logic...

02:26.880 --> 02:28.549
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.050
It's rationality.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.686
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

02:42.095 --> 02:45.899
DAVID: Primalect was
discontinued four years ago

02:45.966 --> 02:47.100
after clinical trials.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.569
Developed as a basic
pain reliever,

02:48.636 --> 02:50.638
it was found to cause
strokes and arrhythmia

02:50.704 --> 02:53.307
in a "statistically
significant" number of cases.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.276
Know who would have
access to it now?

02:55.343 --> 02:57.211
After clinical trials--
pharmacists, doctors,

02:57.278 --> 02:58.646
nurses,
hospital staff.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.449
The good news is, I don't
think he intended to kill.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.283
Why?

03:02.350 --> 03:03.351
A narrow-gauge syringe

03:03.417 --> 03:05.719
suggests some level
of competence.

03:05.786 --> 03:06.854
Wouldn't that make him
more dangerous, though?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.456
Yeah, but he could
have used strychnine

03:08.522 --> 03:10.758
or cyanide or any one
of a hundred toxins

03:10.824 --> 03:13.861
that were available that
would have caused fatalities.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.663
Right. So he just chose a
product that would only be

03:15.729 --> 03:17.498
harmful to a percentage of those
who used it.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.667
Which does not describe
a homicidal intent.

03:19.733 --> 03:23.203
It's more like he's trying
to communicate with us.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.738
Well, I can't speak

03:24.805 --> 03:25.739
to intent,

03:25.806 --> 03:28.609
but I can shed a little light
on the methodology used.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.143
Okay, so start
with Megan's assumption

03:30.210 --> 03:31.612
that our poisoner

03:31.679 --> 03:33.414
is trying to communicate
with us, right?

03:33.481 --> 03:34.915
He's-He's trying
to provide

03:34.982 --> 03:37.518
information by tampering
with these medications.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.153
Now, the commonality-- the
point he keeps repeating--

03:40.220 --> 03:42.356
is his choice of medications.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.391
DON:
Yeah, but we didn't find

03:43.457 --> 03:45.125
a connection between any
of the three products.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.627
Three? No, Don, four.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.628
Four.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.997
You guys are forgetting about
the contaminate itself.

03:50.063 --> 03:50.931
The Primalect.

03:50.998 --> 03:51.799
The Primalect.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.434
Yeah, but they don't even
sell that anymore.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.569
Maybe not, but information
theory indicates

03:55.636 --> 03:56.670
that there is a connection.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.171
So what's
information theory?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.041
Information theory--
it's about getting a message

04:01.108 --> 04:03.143
from point "A"
to point "B."

04:03.210 --> 04:04.712
* *

04:04.778 --> 04:07.315
Picture a three-piece
jazz combo

04:07.381 --> 04:09.283
playing a certain song.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.620
There are many different ways
to hear the same song.

04:12.686 --> 04:17.925
( ring tone
playing trio's melody )

04:17.991 --> 04:19.693
( piano playing melody )

04:19.760 --> 04:22.896
Each method will reproduce
the music differently,

04:22.963 --> 04:25.466
but the tune--
the tune remains discernible.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.170
Now if tampering medications
is our poisoner's music,

04:30.237 --> 04:32.606
then Primalect is the key
he's playing it in.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.343
Wait, you think it was more
than just a weapon.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.378
I think it's the key
to the message.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.114
The Primalect controversy
was over four years ago.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.750
We pulled that
from the market.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.751
Not before it caused

04:43.817 --> 04:45.419
a significant
number of strokes.

04:45.486 --> 04:48.055
Well, that's what clinical
trials are for, Agent Reeves.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.724
But it's my understanding
that the product tampering

04:50.791 --> 04:52.960
isn't limited
to the Truften inhalers

04:53.026 --> 04:54.094
our company makes.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.396
-Please.
-Thank you.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.498
No, the product was also
used to contaminate

04:57.565 --> 04:59.433
cough syrup and nasal spray.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.234
The patent for
the nasal spray

05:01.301 --> 05:03.604
was developed
at Tallridge Labs--

05:03.671 --> 05:05.105
a subsidiary of Graybridge--

05:05.172 --> 05:07.708
and the cough syrup is also
a Graybridge product.

05:07.775 --> 05:08.909
DAVID:
All three products

05:08.976 --> 05:10.544
tampered with
and the poison used

05:10.611 --> 05:12.045
can be traced to your company.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.582
You're being targeted,
Mr. Brindell.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.317
What would you suggest
we do?

05:17.385 --> 05:18.786
What would
we suggest?

05:18.852 --> 05:21.589
A total recall
of all your products.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.758
You expect me to pull
hundreds of medications

05:24.825 --> 05:27.528
over four instances
of tampering?

05:27.595 --> 05:30.130
Two kids almost
lost their dad.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.999
A college student
with a cough

05:32.065 --> 05:33.967
almost never made it
back to class.

05:34.034 --> 05:34.868
These aren't instances.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.537
Graybridge develops
and manufactures

05:36.604 --> 05:38.939
13% of the nation's
vital drugs,

05:39.006 --> 05:40.708
including the most efficient
heart medications

05:40.774 --> 05:42.142
on the market.

05:42.209 --> 05:42.943
We provide the Third World

05:43.010 --> 05:46.680
with large quantities of
medicine at low and no cost.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.383
That sounds like you have a hell
of a press release prepared.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.420
20 million people have asthma.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.488
Nine million of which
are children.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.557
You want to do
some real damage,

05:56.624 --> 05:57.791
make people so scared

05:57.858 --> 05:59.893
that they don't take the
medicines that can help them.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.296
We understand that
your company's worked very hard

06:03.363 --> 06:05.032
to keep this out
of the news.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.667
To avoid a public panic.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.669
And in the absence
of hard facts, the FDA

06:08.736 --> 06:10.370
and the FBI are willing
to go along with that.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.973
But if you're stonewalling us,
when this news comes out,

06:13.040 --> 06:15.142
that's going to be
a big part of it.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.078
I respect your passion.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.580
I respect your job.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.814
I respect you.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.817
But please,
don't threaten me...

06:23.884 --> 06:25.419
or my company.

06:25.486 --> 06:29.089
We've done nothing wrong.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.727
DON: The guy's poisoning
over-the-counter drugs

06:33.794 --> 06:35.262
and we're keeping quiet

06:35.328 --> 06:36.730
because the manufacturer
convinced us to.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.766
I mean, boy, if that
doesn't say something.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.601
About?

06:40.668 --> 06:42.936
Corporations--
their influence.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.772
Research costs
a lot of money.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.608
Without companies
with resources

06:47.675 --> 06:48.676
you can't get
any development.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.077
So, what, you think
it's okay

06:50.143 --> 06:51.645
for someone like Graybridge
to sell drugs

06:51.712 --> 06:52.946
that are potentially
harmful to people?

06:53.013 --> 06:55.483
No, I'm saying
nothing is completely safe.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.084
Peanuts can kill

06:57.150 --> 06:58.986
some people.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.621
If that were the standard
to releasing drugs

07:00.688 --> 07:01.755
then you wouldn't have
any drugs--

07:01.822 --> 07:03.624
prescription
or otherwise.

07:03.691 --> 07:08.195
Okay, eight-letter word
for, uh... egotistical.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.997
"Conceited."

07:10.063 --> 07:14.034
"Conceited" is
a nine-letter word.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.769
C-O-N-C-E-T-E-D.

07:15.836 --> 07:19.907
Another person might think
that our educational system

07:19.973 --> 07:22.510
has failed you
completely, Charlie.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.478
You see, in
urban engineering

07:24.545 --> 07:25.913
every time
you build a bridge

07:25.979 --> 07:27.881
it destroys
someone's property.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.782
Every bypass

07:28.849 --> 07:30.450
hurts
someone's business.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.252
I mean, you know
that going in.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.688
You just have to weigh
the benefits against the risks,

07:34.755 --> 07:37.257
and hope to hell you're doing
more good than harm.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.191
I don't buy that.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.393
I mean, there's got to be
something we can do.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.795
You know, if it were
one drug

07:41.862 --> 07:43.731
believe me, we would put out
a public warning,

07:43.797 --> 07:45.933
but the thing is, how do you
warn against random attacks?

07:45.999 --> 07:49.269
Well, there's random
and then there's random.

07:49.336 --> 07:52.139
The difference being what?

07:52.205 --> 07:54.508
Here,

07:54.575 --> 07:55.643
give me that.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.944
Pencil, pencil.

07:57.010 --> 07:57.811
Okay.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.614
Here we have
a stream of information, right?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.415
A string of letters.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.685
Okay, so what is it?
It's S-T-E?

08:04.752 --> 08:06.253
All right, so what's
the next letter?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.958
Well, that depends on...

08:11.024 --> 08:13.260
seven-letter word
for "ciliate protozoan."

08:13.326 --> 08:14.628
Dad, ignore the clue.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.597
Well, it could be anything.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.699
It could be... "stencil..."

08:18.766 --> 08:21.034
uh... "steeple..."

08:21.101 --> 08:22.135
"stellar..."

08:22.202 --> 08:23.436
It could be anything.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.538
Not anything, Dad.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.206
Just... just a lot of things.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.408
See, absent other
information-- clues--

08:28.475 --> 08:30.978
we really... we don't know what
the next letter's going to be.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.714
But since there are letters
that are more likely

08:33.781 --> 08:36.083
to be the next letter
in the sequence than others,

08:36.149 --> 08:37.585
like "A" or "E,"

08:37.651 --> 08:38.652
or like "R..."

08:38.719 --> 08:39.853
I see what you're saying.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.388
So it's not
completely random.

08:41.454 --> 08:43.123
It's called information entropy.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.658
See, you're bounded
by the alphabet.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.393
26 possibilities.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.129
Further bounded by the inventory
of the English language.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.734
So what is our poisoner's
boundaries?

08:53.801 --> 08:55.603
Right. Well, I mean, look,
he only messed

08:55.669 --> 08:57.605
with Graybridge's drugs.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.739
So that's one boundary. Okay.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.807
Now you might make

08:59.873 --> 09:01.208
geographical assumptions
as well, right?

09:01.274 --> 09:02.309
I mean, it's not likely

09:02.375 --> 09:03.744
he's going to jump on a plane

09:03.811 --> 09:04.978
to Idaho for the next attack.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.615
Yeah, but you're still casting
a very wide net.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.750
DON: Can you narrow it down
using your entropy thing

09:09.817 --> 09:12.019
so that we could pinpoint
where he might hit next?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.887
Well, given the limited
data set you're talking about,

09:13.954 --> 09:15.155
all the work
I have to do...

09:15.222 --> 09:17.157
I mean, it's not like
I can just, you know...

09:17.224 --> 09:20.027
whip up a magic formula
for every single problem.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.896
Well, that's not what you said
last Friday.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.732
Well, he did have
a couple beers in him, so...

09:24.798 --> 09:25.866
Actually, it was
four beers.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.101
And it's "stentor"

09:28.168 --> 09:29.903
What? What is stentor?

09:29.970 --> 09:32.205
The ciliate protozoan.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.313
You know, as a law
enforcement officer,

09:40.380 --> 09:43.717
I shouldn't be this shocked
at how many people shoplift.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.653
Come on, I'm concentrating here.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.921
I'm trying to find
a product tampering needle

09:47.988 --> 09:50.157
in 500 hours
of video haystack.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.424
DON: Hey, guys,
the Assistant Director

09:51.491 --> 09:53.460
wants this treated as a serious
extortion case, okay?

09:53.526 --> 09:55.663
Not as a public health crisis.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.198
Which means total
press blackout remains.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.668
Well, someone should
have told the bad guy.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.671
DON:
What, are you kidding me?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.038
What, he tipped
a free weekly?

10:05.105 --> 10:05.939
Yeah.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.941
"The Toxic Manifesto."
Part one of ten?!

10:08.008 --> 10:09.743
It lists all the drugs
he's tampered with,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.745
plus hundreds more
he says he intends on poisoning.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.181
I guess this
guy got tired

10:14.247 --> 10:15.949
of waiting around
for us to figure out

10:16.016 --> 10:17.217
-what he was trying to say.
-Yeah.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.586
And left anyone in need
of these medications

10:19.653 --> 10:21.388
to play Russian roulette
with their life.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.128
DON:
The Toxic Manifesto.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.098
He gives really
specific details in here

10:31.164 --> 10:33.100
as to why
the attacks occur.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.003
Apparently the FDA cleared
Primalect for clinical trials

10:36.069 --> 10:38.138
despite Graybridge
knowing the risks.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.072
Knowing how?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.874
They had reports
on the potential

10:40.941 --> 10:42.242
for strokes
and heart attacks,

10:42.309 --> 10:45.145
and they somehow cajoled the FDA
into going forward, anyway.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.881
It's really great when big
business and government

10:47.948 --> 10:49.750
work so closely together.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.752
What do you think
his next move would be?

10:51.819 --> 10:54.021
Well, it doesn't
say here in part one,

10:54.087 --> 10:57.124
but it might in parts
two through ten.

11:01.628 --> 11:02.963
It's a low-rent bar.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.165
Yeah, newspaper's
in the back room.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.836
Strange place to put out
a free weekly newspaper.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.946
Come on, man! You have
no right to be doing this.

11:19.012 --> 11:19.646
Come on!

11:19.713 --> 11:20.914
Who do you
think you are?!

11:20.981 --> 11:22.515
-Get out of my files!
Come on! -F.B.I.!

11:22.582 --> 11:23.450
What's going on here?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.786
This guy just came in here
and started going

11:25.853 --> 11:27.320
through my stuff.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.321
Gun, David.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.757
Put your hands up.
Easy.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.725
-David...
-I have a permit for that.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.928
You won't exactly mind if I
don't take your word for it.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.964
Grab a piece
of the desk.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.070
I get a couple pounds
of manifestos, exposГ©s

11:43.136 --> 11:45.205
and conspiracy theories
every week.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.540
Probably would have recycled
this one with the rest,

11:47.607 --> 11:48.675
then the guy calls me,

11:48.742 --> 11:51.344
starts giving me
details...

11:51.411 --> 11:52.746
Well, the manifesto,
and any other materials

11:52.813 --> 11:55.148
he might have sent you, those
are gonna be evidence now,

11:55.215 --> 11:58.185
so I'm gonna need you
to turn them over.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.955
You know, I do have First
Amendment protections.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.157
Yeah, but those
don't even seem to protect

12:04.224 --> 12:06.359
real journalists
these days.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.561
You publish record reviews
and phone sex ads.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.696
Want to try your luck?

12:09.763 --> 12:10.697
My luck?

12:10.764 --> 12:12.232
My luck is that
the story that could

12:12.299 --> 12:14.101
put me on the map
gets my office trashed

12:14.167 --> 12:15.268
and me threatened
with imprisonment.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.938
Hey, man, you wanted front row,
you got front row.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.483
So much for
the public's right to know.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.923
Bill Yardley,
Promethean Security.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.560
All right, thank you.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.862
Your permit checks out,

12:41.929 --> 12:43.363
but that still
doesn't explain

12:43.430 --> 12:44.998
what the hell you're
doing here.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.067
I'm under contract
at Graybridge Pharmaceuticals.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.468
And?

12:48.535 --> 12:51.504
And I'm assisting them with
their tampering investigation.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.207
By roughing up a reporter
and tossing his office?

12:54.274 --> 12:57.777
I'm not limited by the same
constraints you people are.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.347
Kid doesn't want
to press charges.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.415
See?

13:02.482 --> 13:06.119
We find you anywhere near
our investigation again

13:06.186 --> 13:08.721
and I will charge you with
obstruction of justice myself.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.023
Are we clear?

13:10.090 --> 13:13.360
Don't forget my gun.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.695
( knocking )

13:15.762 --> 13:18.665
Young Eppes, your very own copy
of "The Toxic Manifesto."

13:18.731 --> 13:21.034
-Unabridged.
-Okay.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.704
Uh, we've quite
clearly established

13:24.771 --> 13:26.840
that English isn't my forte,

13:26.907 --> 13:29.442
but, Don, this looks
like gibberish to me.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.243
It's only 219 pages,

13:30.310 --> 13:31.945
but Megan says
it goes to motive,

13:32.012 --> 13:33.746
so I'm thinking
it might be helpful

13:33.813 --> 13:35.082
with your Information
Theory thing.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.084
The entropy angle
is a blunt instrument,

13:37.150 --> 13:40.553
but if I could just, if I could
refine it with his intent...

13:40.620 --> 13:42.789
There you go.
Now you're in gear.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.592
The thing is, I've got papers
to grade and classes to teach.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.727
The guy put people in the
hospital and says there's gonna

13:47.794 --> 13:50.397
-be more, so, I know you're
busy, but... -I understand.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.264
Larry.
How are you?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.100
Don. I'm very well,
thank you.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.268
Charles, can I pick your brain.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.671
You're more than welcome
to whatever scraps

13:58.738 --> 13:59.907
my brother
leaves behind.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.741
"The Toxic Manifesto."

14:01.808 --> 14:03.076
Hey, can I
see this, please?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.345
This is about
the medicine scare?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.214
-Yeah. -Yeah, 'cause
the news was vague.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.318
It sounded like it was a hoax,
urban myth or something.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.319
It's more like "something."

14:12.385 --> 14:13.753
I mean,
The Outrage is retracting,

14:13.820 --> 14:14.821
Graybridge is denying

14:14.888 --> 14:16.789
and word for me on high
is not to encourage

14:16.856 --> 14:18.425
"irrational panic."

14:18.491 --> 14:19.726
Well, should there be
a rational panic?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.761
-Yeah, well, that's the
question. -( phone ringing )

14:21.828 --> 14:22.862
Excuse me. Eppes.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.232
I just got the phone records
from the Melrose Outrage.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.134
They have our suspect
calling the paper

14:27.200 --> 14:28.168
from Sibley, California.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.237
Turns out the manifesto
was mailed

14:30.303 --> 14:32.940
from the same location, so I
called the postmaster up there

14:33.006 --> 14:35.008
and he remembers the guy
who mailed the package.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.176
A middle-aged black man.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.311
Yeah, Sibley, why does
that sound familiar?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.580
Small town,
Angeles Crest Mountains.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.714
Oh, yeah, right.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.783
That's where the U.S. marshal
got killed last year.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.386
Yeah, the marshals got into
a standoff with Bob McHugh,

14:46.453 --> 14:48.721
a local rancher who was there
selling tainted beef.

14:48.788 --> 14:49.990
McHugh shot one of the marshals,

14:50.057 --> 14:51.258
and then disappeared
into the mountains.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.293
Right, right.
What, you think he's our guy?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.527
Well, McHugh's white,

14:54.594 --> 14:56.529
and the guy who mailed
the package is black.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.899
And the postmaster remembers him
asking where to find McHugh.

14:59.967 --> 15:03.003
So the question is, what is
a poisoner doing up in Sibley?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.704
And what does he want
with McHugh?

15:04.771 --> 15:07.040
Well, I mean, he's on the run.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.675
McHugh knows how to disappear.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.544
If he's trying to disappear,
he sure picked the right spot.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.613
Well, let's get
Colby and David up there, okay?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.182
Already on their way.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.019
Man, there's some nice
views up here, though.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.920
This makes me
a little bit homesick.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.423
Yeah? This is what Winchester,
Idaho looks like?

15:23.490 --> 15:24.757
Yeah, pretty much.

15:24.824 --> 15:28.428
My hometown
is a small town.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.397
All right,
so we need to figure out

15:30.463 --> 15:31.965
why a poisoner's trying to find

15:32.032 --> 15:33.333
a federal fugitive.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.303
The better question is
how he intends to find him?

15:36.369 --> 15:37.971
Best people to answer
that question are the ones

15:38.038 --> 15:41.474
who've been looking for him
for the past seven months.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.250
Sinclair.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.919
Edgerton.
How you doing, man?

15:52.986 --> 15:54.121
This here's
Agent Granger.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.156
-Nice to meet you.
-How are you? Pleasure.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.991
You here for the McHugh search?

15:58.058 --> 15:59.059
Uh, in a way.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.327
I got the call
about a month ago.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.594
I been in and out of a bunch

16:01.661 --> 16:03.696
of towns on this mountain,
but McHugh's from here,

16:03.763 --> 16:04.897
so we think
he'll be back.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.533
Have gun, will travel, right?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.868
You have time
for an information swap?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.137
Yeah, let me
get unpacked.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.938
I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.973
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.875
That's Edgerton?

16:15.942 --> 16:19.312
Yeah, he helped us out
on a sniper case last year, why?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.814
That guy was
a sniper legend in Afghanistan.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.016
You'd see
his work everywhere,

16:23.083 --> 16:24.284
you'd never see him.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.686
Colonel in Special Ops
said he was the bastard son

16:26.753 --> 16:27.954
of Clint Eastwood and Yoda.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.423
I'll get you
an autograph.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.358
All right.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.094
Yeah, I remember
seeing him in the diner.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.629
Black guy kind of stands out
here in Sibley.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.632
There was nothing particularly
suspicious about him, though.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.369
There's a good chance
that he's our poisoner.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.870
COLBY: Yeah, we traced
the manifesto

16:43.936 --> 16:46.306
that was published back
to the post office up here.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.808
And the postmaster says
he was asking about McHugh.

16:48.875 --> 16:49.942
( chuckling )

16:50.009 --> 16:52.612
That's like going to Orlando
and asking about Mickey Mouse.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.682
Yeah, still,
we think there might be

16:55.748 --> 16:57.150
some connection,
though.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.222
They've turned McHugh
into some kind of local hero.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.257
Yeah, last of
the independent ranchers

17:04.324 --> 17:05.792
fighting
the big, bad government.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.161
Never mind that he was
selling tainted beef.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.097
Never mind
that he shot a U.S. marshal.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.398
His wife still
lives around here.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.800
She's got a lot of friends
among the locals.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.536
And these days,
McHugh is the second largest

17:16.603 --> 17:18.271
source of income
for this town.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.739
Really? What's the first?

17:19.806 --> 17:23.210
Housing and feeding all the FBI
agents looking for McHugh.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.678
( chuckling ):
How long you been after him?

17:25.745 --> 17:29.682
-About three weeks now.
-You've had any luck yet?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.718
Yeah, I picked up his trail a
few times, but after 30 years

17:31.784 --> 17:33.653
of living here and seven months
on the run,

17:33.720 --> 17:35.555
he knows this place
a lot better than I do,

17:35.622 --> 17:37.557
plus he's got
his local fans.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.660
Can you give us a description
of this unidentified black male?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.495
How 'bout a picture?

17:46.366 --> 17:47.567
David,
do me a favor.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.170
Keep me in the loop
on this one, all right?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.571
If your guy has a plan

17:51.638 --> 17:56.008
for finding McHugh,
I want to know what it is.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.112
( phones ringing )

17:59.179 --> 18:01.181
Oh, hi, Agent Reeves.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.015
Professor Fleinhardt.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.251
I don't think Charlie's here.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.553
Well, you know, actually,
I came to talk to you.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.755
Oh, if you have come
to offer me a ride

18:08.821 --> 18:11.224
in that car of yours,
I can't go right now.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.793
Actually, I came to talk
to you about that.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.195
The manifesto?

18:15.262 --> 18:17.930
Yeah, um, you see,
I'm a reader,

18:17.997 --> 18:20.800
and readers read,
and I just, I happened upon

18:20.867 --> 18:22.235
Charlie's copy of this,

18:22.302 --> 18:24.604
and, let me tell you,
I was riveted.

18:24.671 --> 18:28.141
Well, then we have slightly
different literary tastes.

18:28.208 --> 18:31.644
Well, tell me, what do you
make of this author?

18:31.711 --> 18:36.449
Uh, well, the use of the word
"manifesto" in and of itself

18:36.516 --> 18:39.085
suggests an inflated
sense of destiny.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.354
Paranoid,
delusions of grandeur.

18:41.421 --> 18:45.358
Yeah, but his discussions of
quantum chemistry, I mean,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.660
these sent me back
to my reference books.

18:47.727 --> 18:51.231
And this man not only
knows whereof he speaks,

18:51.298 --> 18:53.533
some of his scientific
arguments are, well,

18:53.600 --> 18:56.203
they're downright
revolutionary.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.205
You're saying
he's a scientist?

18:58.271 --> 18:59.839
Oh, oh, a gifted one.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.509
And what was particularly
interesting to me

19:02.575 --> 19:04.544
was his mention
of this man McHugh.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.247
-Yes, yes, Bob McHugh.
-Yeah.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.315
He's a federal fugitive,

19:08.381 --> 19:10.116
and we think he's trying
to contact him,

19:10.183 --> 19:11.418
but we have no idea why.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.852
Right, and Charlie
mentioned there was

19:12.919 --> 19:14.821
some confusion there, and
that's really why I'm here.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.156
Now listen, you can
throw me out at any moment,

19:17.224 --> 19:18.258
because obviously you're
the experts,

19:18.325 --> 19:19.259
I'm just an amateur,

19:19.326 --> 19:21.294
but this is just
what struck me.

19:21.361 --> 19:26.165
Graybridge Pharmaceuticals is
this man's Frankenstein Monster.

19:26.233 --> 19:29.068
And he will not
be swayed from his path

19:29.135 --> 19:32.004
until that monster
is laid to rest.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.406
So you're saying the connection

19:33.473 --> 19:35.208
isn't between
McHugh and this man.

19:35.275 --> 19:39.412
The connection is between McHugh
and Graybridge Pharmaceuticals.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.381
Well, at least
in his mind that's the case.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.617
Riveted, huh?

19:44.684 --> 19:47.554
Yeah, well, I read it
straight through. Twice.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.623
Because, in case
we were going to...

19:50.690 --> 19:52.158
You know, if we...

19:52.225 --> 19:53.526
You know,
show that I knew what...

19:53.593 --> 19:55.828
I just wanted to make sure
I knew what I was talking about.

19:55.895 --> 20:00.700
I've never heard you
when you didn't.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.837
So based on
Professor Fleinhardt's opinion,

20:04.904 --> 20:07.707
I refined my search to people
with a higher education

20:07.774 --> 20:09.409
in chemistry who might
have had a grudge

20:09.476 --> 20:10.810
against
Graybridge Pharmaceuticals.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.080
Well, that could be anybody
who was ever fired by them.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.182
Pretty much, but then I can
refine the search further

20:16.249 --> 20:19.452
to Edgerton's sketch and refine
it down to male blacks.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.988
And I find Mark Brott.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.856
Lead chemist, Tallridge Lab

20:23.923 --> 20:24.824
since 1994.

20:24.891 --> 20:28.328
-The company that
developed Primalect. -Exactly.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.196
And Brott kept sending
memo after memo

20:30.263 --> 20:34.200
to Taylor Brindell warning him
that the drug was unsafe.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.034
And he was fired?

20:35.101 --> 20:36.336
Two weeks before the FDA

20:36.403 --> 20:37.770
approved the clinical trials,

20:37.837 --> 20:40.407
Brott was let go for
"poor job performance."

20:40.473 --> 20:41.441
So they just screwed
this guy over

20:41.508 --> 20:43.343
because he was a whistleblower.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.478
After that, he disappears.

20:45.545 --> 20:49.048
No address, no phone records,
no credit cards.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.350
Last seen
in Sibley, California,

20:50.417 --> 20:51.418
looking for Bob McHugh.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.419
But what's the connection

20:52.485 --> 20:53.620
between a fired
drug company chemist

20:53.686 --> 20:55.655
and a fugitive
cattle rancher?

20:55.722 --> 20:58.291
On page 189 of
"The Toxic Manifesto,"

20:58.358 --> 21:00.860
Brott talks
about McHugh.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.496
DON: "The government abandoned
its duty to the public,

21:03.563 --> 21:06.366
like it abandoned McHugh."

21:06.433 --> 21:08.167
-Abandoned him how?
-That part's unclear.

21:08.234 --> 21:11.438
But what is clear is that Brott
hasn't killed anyone yet.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.606
And McHugh has.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.241
Brott was, what,
looking for someone

21:15.308 --> 21:16.376
to fight the government with?

21:16.443 --> 21:18.277
Yeah, and he picked a murderer.

21:27.086 --> 21:30.490
MEGAN: A year ago, Bob McHugh
was selling tainted beef.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.225
When the USDA and the marshals
showed up at his house

21:33.292 --> 21:34.994
to shut him down,
he barricaded himself in.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.564
On day three of the standoff,
Channel 8 managed

21:37.630 --> 21:40.232
to get a camera phone
in the house.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.401
I followed every one
of their laws.

21:41.468 --> 21:45.705
My cattle were checked,
given their antibiotics,

21:45.772 --> 21:48.040
the government knows that.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.276
They're still trying
to send me to jail.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.511
REPORTER:
They say you

21:51.578 --> 21:52.645
intentionally
sold tainted beef.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.247
I have been eating my own damn
beef my whole life.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.585
I'm still standing.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.154
What's really going on...

22:02.221 --> 22:04.857
What's really going on
is the federal government

22:04.924 --> 22:06.793
wants me out of the way.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.729
On day four, McHugh shot
one of the negotiators.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.931
Now, the raid team hit the
house, but he somehow managed

22:11.998 --> 22:13.500
to slip past them
and into the mountains.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.001
Right, but I mean,
as far as we know,

22:15.067 --> 22:15.902
McHugh and Brott never met.

22:15.968 --> 22:19.271
I mean, we don't even know
if they communicated.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.740
And what, all we have
on Brott

22:20.807 --> 22:23.710
is a possible motive
and a sketch on a napkin.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.613
Placemat.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.615
Plus his face
on our plasma screen.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.850
We went back to the drugstore
security footage

22:30.917 --> 22:32.118
looking for Brott...

22:32.184 --> 22:34.654
DAVID:
And hit four for four.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.423
All right, well,
Brott's our guy.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.424
Yeah, but I don't think
he's coming

22:37.490 --> 22:38.858
back to L.A.
Watch what happens

22:38.925 --> 22:40.860
when you put the tamperings
in chronological order.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.830
Yeah, I see what
you're saying.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.432
He's working
his way north.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.799
That's right.
Straight up to Sibley.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.968
So contacting McHugh
was always part of the plan.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.970
So you're Mark Brott.
Graybridge fires you

22:51.037 --> 22:52.972
for blowing the whistle
on the defective drug.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.441
You retaliate by poisoning
their products.

22:54.507 --> 22:58.578
You write"The Toxic Manifesto"
to expose Graybridge.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.312
And the federal government
for allowing Graybridge

23:00.379 --> 23:01.180
to sell dangerous products.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.816
Now, he and McHugh definitely
have a common enemy.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.586
There's a lot of anti-government
people out there. Why McHugh?

23:06.653 --> 23:08.120
There's got to be something
about McHugh.

23:08.187 --> 23:11.257
Something that Brott is fixated
on or identifies with.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.025
So are we looking for McHugh
hoping to find Brott

23:13.092 --> 23:15.161
or do we look for Brott and
figure we might find McHugh?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.896
Both.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.616
-ALAN: Hey, Don.
-Hey, guys. Sorry, I don't have

23:36.683 --> 23:38.585
enough open floor space
in my apartment.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.186
Yeah, I know.
I've been to your apartment.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.154
You don't have enough
floor space, period.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.090
Wait. You have
an apartment?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.625
Ha-ha.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.627
What is this? This is
the Angeles Crest, right?

23:47.694 --> 23:50.396
Crystal Lake, the San Gabriel
Reservoir, Mt. Wilson.

23:50.463 --> 23:51.998
Yeah. You still
go up there?

23:52.064 --> 23:53.666
It's got the greatest
hiking trails.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.901
Has pretty good fishing
up there, too.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.035
'Cause we got this fugitive

23:56.102 --> 23:57.504
who's been hiding out
around here

23:57.570 --> 23:58.605
for, like, seven months now.

23:58.671 --> 23:59.639
Bob McHugh?

23:59.706 --> 24:01.040
That's right.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.909
Just go to the post office
on a Monday.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.777
You got a lot of time
to look at "wanted" posters.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.879
It looks like the poisoner
went up there looking for him

24:06.946 --> 24:07.947
so that's where I'm going.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.949
The thing is, I mean,
you remember Edgerton?

24:10.016 --> 24:11.383
So he's up there
tracking him,

24:11.450 --> 24:12.652
but I mean, he can't find him.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.121
Edgerton?
The FBI sniper instructor.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.789
Yeah. He's also the Bureau's
best tracker.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.024
But the problem
is we got,

24:18.090 --> 24:20.627
you know, over 650,000 acres
of mountain here,

24:20.693 --> 24:22.061
and apparently,
McHugh's trail

24:22.128 --> 24:24.396
-never crossed
the same place twice. -Hmm.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.833
You know...

24:26.899 --> 24:31.070
there's a famous problem
in-in graph theory

24:31.137 --> 24:33.272
called "The Seven Bridges
of Konigsberg."

24:33.339 --> 24:37.109
The city of Konigsberg included
two islands connected

24:37.176 --> 24:40.146
to each other and the mainland
by seven bridges.

24:40.212 --> 24:43.215
The problem? To try to cross
all seven bridges once

24:43.282 --> 24:46.619
and only once, and end up
where you started.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.821
Leonhard Euler proved
mathematically

24:48.888 --> 24:51.057
that it wasn't possible
to do that.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.259
If there's an odd number
of bridges

24:53.325 --> 24:54.260
to even one of the islands,

24:54.326 --> 24:57.163
then you can't cross every
bridge without crossing

24:57.229 --> 24:59.098
the same bridge twice.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.001
Right. Well, I mean,
we ain't in Konigsberg.

25:02.068 --> 25:02.802
Which is where?

25:02.869 --> 25:05.605
Pre-World War I Prussia,
but Don, the point is

25:05.672 --> 25:06.973
the beauty of graph theory

25:07.039 --> 25:09.075
is that the shape
and size of the grid

25:09.141 --> 25:11.844
doesn't matter,
just the number of points

25:11.911 --> 25:13.580
and the links
connecting them.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.347
I see what you're saying.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.850
Eventually, he has to cross
the same path twice?

25:17.917 --> 25:20.687
Not necessarily.
He may repeat some paths.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.155
I can use probabilistic graph
theory to rank them

25:23.222 --> 25:24.356
in order of likely use.

25:24.423 --> 25:26.859
I'm headed up there tomorrow.
You think you can do it by then?

25:26.926 --> 25:28.127
I'm gonna have to come
with you, because

25:28.194 --> 25:30.029
there's-there's all sorts of
questions about access

25:30.096 --> 25:32.098
-that need to be answered. -Come
on, wait a minute, Charlie.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.866
-Charlie! -And of course,
search methodology

25:33.933 --> 25:35.702
and non-recorded
data, so...

25:35.768 --> 25:37.469
Charlie, don't you have
midterms to grade?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.038
I'll get the TAs
to do them.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.480
MEGAN ( over phone ): So,
remember the McHugh interview?

25:48.547 --> 25:51.851
The part where he said
he gave all the infected cattle

25:51.918 --> 25:53.753
their required antibiotics?

25:53.820 --> 25:55.755
Guess who makes
those antibiotics.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.690
Our friends at Graybridge.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.859
So what if McHugh was telling
the truth?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.861
What if he didn't know
the beef was contaminated

26:01.928 --> 26:03.029
because he didn't know

26:03.095 --> 26:05.164
the antibiotics he was giving
them were defective?

26:05.231 --> 26:06.899
That would explain
what Brott wants, right?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.801
I mean, to him,
McHugh's just another weapon

26:08.868 --> 26:10.402
against Graybridge.
Look, why don't you

26:10.469 --> 26:12.605
just follow in that direction?
I'll talk to you later.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.774
Professor and Agent Eppes.

26:14.841 --> 26:15.708
How can I not learn
something today?

26:15.775 --> 26:17.576
Actually, we came to
sit in your classroom,

26:17.644 --> 26:18.611
if that's all right.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.714
Absolutely. Let me get you
up to speed.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.855
What about that?

26:28.921 --> 26:29.656
What?

26:29.722 --> 26:31.858
Broken branch,

26:31.924 --> 26:34.894
not from an animal.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.029
Someone sat here
on this tree.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.264
What, you think
it's McHugh?

26:38.330 --> 26:42.334
No. It was a woman
wearing a size-six sneaker.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.270
McHugh's got a big foot
and an even bigger boot.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.573
Yeah. She stopped
and had lunch here

26:47.640 --> 26:49.642
probably less
than an hour ago.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.911
And you know that how?

26:51.978 --> 26:54.413
She didn't like her PB and J.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.916
The ants haven't found it yet.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.757
What do you got?

27:04.824 --> 27:06.826
It's a pretty old print,

27:06.893 --> 27:09.361
but I'd like to see
where it takes us.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.702
We'll have to backtrack,

27:15.768 --> 27:18.237
cross the river
to pick it up again.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.007
I mean, we can just cut
through this dump, can't we?

27:21.073 --> 27:23.209
You see these tracks, how they
kind of stop and start

27:23.275 --> 27:24.944
like someone was riding
the brakes?

27:25.011 --> 27:26.946
The National Guard came through
here at night

27:27.013 --> 27:28.380
with the headlights off.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.250
They do maneuvers
out here.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.119
If they go home
with unused ammo,

27:33.185 --> 27:34.486
their allotment gets reduced.

27:34.553 --> 27:36.388
So they sneak over here
and ditch the excess munitions.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.324
There's all kinds
of explosives in there.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.391
You don't want to try

27:39.458 --> 27:39.992
to go hiking
through that.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.460
You think that's
what he's after?

27:41.527 --> 27:43.362
No. No, there's
no sign of that.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.864
Probably just looking
for something edible

27:44.931 --> 27:46.298
or on his way back
into Sibley.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.134
CHARLIE:
I'm curious.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.402
When you lose him,
what methodology

27:50.469 --> 27:52.404
might you employ
to pick him up again?

27:52.471 --> 27:54.741
Start where he broke trail:

27:54.807 --> 27:56.275
a stream, series
of flat rocks.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.944
Then circle around
till I find fresh sign.

27:58.010 --> 28:03.015
So you, you lose time, pretty
much duplicating your work

28:03.082 --> 28:04.516
while McHugh's gaining time.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.954
Kind of explains why
we're all still out here, huh?

28:29.508 --> 28:31.243
Hey, Colby, take a look at this.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.345
I've been going through
the rest of the security footage

28:33.412 --> 28:34.981
to establish Brott's
movements, right?

28:35.047 --> 28:37.216
This is from
the first tampering.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.489
COLBY: Looks like Brott's
being followed.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.391
Watch what happens.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.526
( computer beeping )

28:47.593 --> 28:48.594
Recognize our boy?

28:48.660 --> 28:52.131
That's Yardley, Graybridge
Pharmaceutical's hired gun.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.103
So?

28:57.169 --> 28:58.670
I've just about isolated
all the trails

28:58.737 --> 29:00.539
that McHugh could
have access to.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.341
Charlie, did you actually
put pins in the wall?

29:02.408 --> 29:04.410
Hmm? Yeah.
Tape didn't work. You know? I...

29:04.476 --> 29:06.145
Well, I mean,
they find holes, it's gonna go

29:06.212 --> 29:07.713
-on my expense report.
-I tried sticking it in...

29:07.780 --> 29:10.316
-( phone rings ) -I don't
get you sometimes. Eppes.

29:10.382 --> 29:13.085
We got Yardley following Brott
into the first pharmacy.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.554
He watches him go in,
then goes in himself

29:15.621 --> 29:17.023
and asks about Brott.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.092
So Graybridge was having
Brott followed.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.861
That means once the first victim
got struck,

29:21.928 --> 29:23.629
they had to be aware
it was a tampering.

29:23.695 --> 29:24.964
And didn't say word one to us.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.099
Instead, they put Yardley
on Brott's trail.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.635
We could pick up Brindell
at Graybridge right now.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.371
No, no. I think it's better
to wait, you know?

29:32.438 --> 29:34.373
Let 'em not know exactly
what we're up to.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.009
It's your call. I got a warrant
for Brott's computer.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.377
We're going over it right now.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.679
-( knocking ) -I got to go.
Let me know what you find.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.448
Okay.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.582
Hey.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.651
Sir, park rangers
found a body

29:45.717 --> 29:46.752
about three miles
out of town.

29:46.819 --> 29:47.887
Description fits
Mark Brott,

29:47.954 --> 29:48.654
the guy
you're looking for.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.990
Yeah? You got
a cause of death?

29:51.057 --> 29:53.059
Appears to have fallen
about 40 feet into a creek bed.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.394
The M.E. will have a preliminary
for you in the morning.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.463
All right, good, Officer.
Thanks. Good night.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.870
Mark Brott is dead.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.337
You think he fell?

30:05.404 --> 30:06.472
Or he was pushed.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.274
I mean, Graybridge
was having him followed.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.609
You know, they got
motive for wanting him dead.

30:10.676 --> 30:13.812
( indistinct voices )

30:33.099 --> 30:34.566
We've recovered
some internal e-mails

30:34.633 --> 30:35.534
off of Brott's hard drive.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.904
In one of them,
he's telling his bosses

30:37.970 --> 30:39.939
that the antibiotic
they were selling

30:40.006 --> 30:41.974
to cattle ranchers
had serious problems.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.842
So, without getting
too technical...

30:43.910 --> 30:44.977
Yeah, it didn't work,

30:45.044 --> 30:46.645
and Graybridge sold it anyway,
right?

30:46.712 --> 30:49.015
And Brott also informed them
that the defective antibiotic

30:49.081 --> 30:51.083
would be detectable
in the bloodstream of anyone

30:51.150 --> 30:52.919
-who had consumed it.
-Wasn't McHugh bragging

30:52.985 --> 30:54.753
about eating his own beef
for years?

30:54.820 --> 30:56.122
Which makes him walking evidence

30:56.188 --> 30:57.589
against Graybridge.

30:57.656 --> 31:00.259
Brott wanted McHugh's blood,
literally.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.561
All right, good.
Talk to you later.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.263
What do you
got, brother?

31:04.330 --> 31:06.865
So, I started with the paths
we know McHugh

31:06.933 --> 31:09.701
has been to,
based on your tracking.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.237
Now, eliminating
unpassable terrain

31:11.303 --> 31:13.239
and areas that are too exposed--

31:13.305 --> 31:14.540
for instance,
popular campsites...

31:14.606 --> 31:16.208
Places where he's likely
to be seen.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.078
Right. I applied
soap bubble theory

31:19.145 --> 31:21.948
-to develop a Steiner tree.
-Say what?

31:22.014 --> 31:24.483
You're not talking actual
soap bubbles and actual trees...

31:24.550 --> 31:26.552
Actual soap bubbles,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:26.618 --> 31:27.719
Actual trees, no.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.421
No, no, no.
I found McHugh's

31:29.488 --> 31:32.491
most likely paths by using
isospectral geometries.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.659
Of course you did.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.128
Everyone knows that
the shortest distance

31:36.195 --> 31:37.896
between two points is a...?

31:37.964 --> 31:39.031
A straight line.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.699
Straight line.
Now, what if we wanted

31:40.766 --> 31:42.601
to find the shortest distance
between three

31:42.668 --> 31:43.669
or-or-or more points?

31:43.735 --> 31:46.705
That's something that
soap bubbles can tell us.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.840
Now, let's take these three
points that you've identified

31:48.907 --> 31:50.442
as places that McHugh
has been at

31:50.509 --> 31:51.343
several times.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.545
Now, imagine each
of these points

31:53.612 --> 31:54.813
as the center of bubbles.

31:54.880 --> 31:58.584
The interior walls formed
by the soap's film

31:58.650 --> 32:01.687
will intercept to create
new vertices, new angles,

32:01.753 --> 32:05.524
new lines and points--
a Steiner tree--

32:05.591 --> 32:09.061
which will reveal the most
efficient lines of travel.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.862
Let's concentrate
on these three points

32:10.929 --> 32:13.532
-that you've identified. -Places
we know that McHugh's been.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.934
Now, when connected,
using the most likely paths,

32:16.002 --> 32:19.205
not only his likely paths

32:19.271 --> 32:22.608
but where
those likely paths meet.

32:22.674 --> 32:23.675
I like it.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.177
So where these lines intersect.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.079
And that has to be...

32:27.146 --> 32:30.316
This guy keeps going back
to his own ranch.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.917
Isn't that interesting?

32:31.984 --> 32:34.220
( knocking )

32:37.256 --> 32:39.758
Mrs. McHugh,
I'm Don Eppes with the FBI.

32:39.825 --> 32:44.763
-I assume you have a warrant?
-No, ma'am, just some questions.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.765
Oh, I thought you people shoot
first and then ask questions.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.967
DON: Mrs. McHugh, your husband
killed a federal officer.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.502
He's gonna have
to answer to that,

32:50.569 --> 32:52.971
but we have some new information
that could clear him

32:53.039 --> 32:54.573
of those original charges.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.210
What? I don't understand?

32:58.277 --> 33:00.079
It seems
we might have been wrong.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.548
We also know he's
been on the property

33:02.614 --> 33:03.715
recently.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.384
Do you, now?

33:05.451 --> 33:07.519
We're mathematically certain.

33:07.586 --> 33:12.258
My husband's great-grandfather
started this ranch.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.960
It's been passed down
three generations.

33:15.027 --> 33:16.528
And one day you people show up

33:16.595 --> 33:18.730
and try to take it away
from him.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.366
Now you show up

33:20.432 --> 33:23.669
and tell me you were wrong.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.004
Well, I'd say
you're about a day late

33:26.072 --> 33:28.006
and a dollar short,
wouldn't you?

33:28.074 --> 33:30.008
Well, listen...

33:31.443 --> 33:35.247
Well, you were right--
he's been here.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.349
He's taking
a big chance.

33:37.416 --> 33:38.917
He's had this place
his whole life.

33:38.984 --> 33:42.054
-It's hard to just walk away.
-Look, let's run this down.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.659
I mean, the marshals
come to arrest him,

33:47.726 --> 33:49.628
he barricades himself
inside the house.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.797
Now, four days later,
in the middle

33:51.863 --> 33:54.966
of a negotiation, for no
apparent reason, he opens fire.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.569
When did crazy
stop being a reason?

33:57.636 --> 33:59.505
The negotiator
catches one in the neck,

33:59.571 --> 34:02.007
-like, right around here.
-The assault team went in

34:02.074 --> 34:03.409
the front and the side doors.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.010
McHugh went out that side window

34:05.077 --> 34:06.645
and makes it to
the tree line there.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.722
What's that?

34:16.788 --> 34:19.625
Look at that.
That's a shot.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.532
( sighs ):
Exit pattern

34:26.598 --> 34:28.400
from a large-bore rifle round.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.802
Look at the angle-- there's
no way it came from inside.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.070
Which is where McHugh was.

34:32.138 --> 34:35.274
-Where do you think this came
from? -Judging from the angle...

34:35.341 --> 34:37.276
-Allowing for prevailing
winds, there. -...there.

34:39.178 --> 34:42.181
SWAT sniper would've been on the
other side, facing the house.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.349
This lie...

34:43.415 --> 34:45.351
( Edgerton sighs )

34:45.417 --> 34:46.985
...faces the raid team.

34:47.052 --> 34:49.221
That's a perfect position
to take out the negotiator.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.589
CHARLIE:
So the suggestion you're making

34:50.656 --> 34:52.491
is that a second gunman
shot the marshal.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.092
Yeah, Charlie, think about it.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.627
I mean, McHugh is living proof

34:55.694 --> 34:57.229
that Graybridge
sold bad drugs.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.631
The last thing they want
is him alive.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.700
Day three of the siege,
he's looking like

35:01.767 --> 35:03.835
he's gonna surrender,
someone shoots the negotiator...

35:03.902 --> 35:04.970
( hammer clicks )

35:05.036 --> 35:06.104
...and gets the
party started.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.073
They're figuring he's gonna
go down in the gunfight.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.876
Instead, chaos ensues,
he slips away.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.613
That, uh, soap film of yours

35:14.680 --> 35:16.848
runs through the hill
up here, doesn't it?

35:16.915 --> 35:19.751
There? Yeah,
more or less.

35:19.818 --> 35:22.221
-Why don't you get back
to the hotel. -Okay, but why?

35:22.288 --> 35:23.989
Fresh sign.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.391
One, maybe two hours.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.725
-That's why.
-All right.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.126
Crest One to Crest Two.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.596
Be careful, Charlie.

36:17.243 --> 36:19.511
Felt someone
following me all day.

36:19.578 --> 36:22.581
Wondered when
you'd close distance.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.483
You pull your trigger,
I'll pull mine.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.185
Now, drop the rifle.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.925
Last chance, Yardley.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.396
( two gunshots )

36:45.070 --> 36:46.772
McHugh!

37:04.756 --> 37:05.624
McHugh!

37:07.559 --> 37:09.595
McHugh, listen! Listen!

37:11.363 --> 37:13.365
McHugh, listen to me!

37:13.432 --> 37:15.434
( echoes ):
McHugh!

37:19.538 --> 37:20.872
( police radio transmission )

37:20.939 --> 37:23.475
Well, if he is in there,
he's sitting on top

37:23.542 --> 37:25.477
of 300 pounds
of U.S. Army ordinance.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.447
Wait, look, here he comes.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.482
-( cocks hammer )
-Anyone comes through that gate,

37:30.549 --> 37:33.452
the dump blows,
and the forest goes with it.

37:33.519 --> 37:35.454
All right, Mr. McHugh,
just take it easy.

37:35.521 --> 37:38.223
No one's coming
through anything, all right?

37:38.290 --> 37:40.191
I can set up a shot from above.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.693
But if I do drop him...

37:41.760 --> 37:44.463
DON: He drops that torch,
we're all going up.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.632
I say we pull it back.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.301
Yeah, let's pull it back, guys.
Back, back, back, back, back.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.402
Back it up.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.041
What are you doing here?

37:56.107 --> 37:57.809
I picked him up in Sibley--
I needed someone

37:57.876 --> 37:59.311
that knew the way.
I'm Agent Reeves.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.278
Edgerton.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.882
You're not gonna believe this--
he's actually sitting

38:03.949 --> 38:05.250
on a National Guard
munitions dump.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.217
He's threatening
to blow it up.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.919
-Well, you don't want to kill
him. -Charlie, we realize that.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.021
I mean, he's not giving us
a lot of options here.

38:10.088 --> 38:13.525
Uh, there's a... there's
a whole mathematical discipline

38:13.592 --> 38:15.193
called negotiation theory.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.529
A good negotiation creates

38:17.596 --> 38:19.665
a framework for agreement
that allows both parties

38:19.731 --> 38:22.401
to make mistakes
and still come out ahead.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.735
MEGAN:
Yeah, we give him

38:23.802 --> 38:25.604
something to strengthen
his position

38:25.671 --> 38:27.406
without weakening ours, but...

38:27.473 --> 38:29.575
-what do we have to give him?
-Information.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.209
We could tell him what we know.

38:31.276 --> 38:34.145
Isn't that like showing all your
cards before the bets are in?

38:34.212 --> 38:36.114
It's counterintuitive, I know,

38:36.181 --> 38:37.749
but here's the math.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.685
EDGERTON: Does this mean
anything to you two?

38:39.751 --> 38:42.554
Yeah, only that
he's probably right.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.523
Whoa, whoa, ho-ho-hold on.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.958
-What are you doing?
-I'm a woman.

38:47.025 --> 38:50.496
To a mountain man like McHugh,
I'm less of a threat.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.797
She's got a point.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.032
She could also kick his ass,
but he doesn't know that.

38:54.099 --> 38:58.404
( chuckles ): I see what kind
of big brother he was.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.339
Mr. McHugh?

39:02.874 --> 39:04.009
Mr. McHugh?

39:04.075 --> 39:05.911
My name

39:05.977 --> 39:08.013
is Megan Reeves.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.616
I'm with the FBI.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.184
And I'm alone.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.853
Last negotiator

39:14.920 --> 39:17.055
ended up with
a bullet in the neck.

39:17.122 --> 39:18.256
But you didn't put it there.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.625
You'd say anything to keep me

39:19.691 --> 39:20.826
from setting off this dump.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.360
Yes, I would,
but there are people

39:22.428 --> 39:26.197
who'd do a hell of a lot more
to make sure you blow it up.

39:26.264 --> 39:27.999
Graybridge Pharmaceuticals

39:28.066 --> 39:32.370
hired a man to kill you, and he
shot that marshal in the back

39:32.438 --> 39:34.139
hoping you'd get killed
in the gunfire.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.742
You were never supposed
to walk out of there alive.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.477
What the hell is
Graybridge Pharmaceuticals?

39:38.544 --> 39:39.745
It's the company that

39:39.811 --> 39:42.047
sold you the bad antibiotic.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.116
That's what contaminated
your beef.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.322
The government destroyed
the herd.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.125
-Th-There's no way to prove any
of this. -Actually, there is.

39:54.192 --> 39:57.629
You eat that beef every day;
it's in your bloodstream.

39:57.696 --> 40:01.366
You blow yourself up,
you lose the only evidence

40:01.433 --> 40:03.234
we have to clear your name.

40:03.301 --> 40:05.170
Please put
that gun down.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.573
Let's go see your wife.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.259
Good job.

40:28.326 --> 40:29.895
Thanks. You, too.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.835
I have the best time
with you guys.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.817
It's a little early in the day

40:51.883 --> 40:53.585
to be stargazing,
huh, Larry?

40:53.652 --> 40:55.887
Oh. Yeah.
Just reflecting

40:55.954 --> 40:58.790
on the late,
unlamented Mark Brott.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.692
DON:
What? He got what he wanted.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.461
I mean, Brindell's in jail,
the case goes to court,

41:03.529 --> 41:04.963
and Graybridge
is out of business.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.766
He got what he wanted
at the cost of his soul.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.702
By hurting the innocent
to forward his agenda,

41:10.769 --> 41:13.972
he became
the very thing he hated.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.207
I just can't help thinking
about all those people

41:16.274 --> 41:18.510
who will never benefit
by all the medicines

41:18.577 --> 41:21.680
that Graybridge
just might have discovered.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.118
LARRY:
Some people--

41:27.185 --> 41:29.688
not theoretical physicists
like myself--

41:29.755 --> 41:32.390
but there are some
who might feel knowledge

41:32.457 --> 41:34.760
is this unshakable pillar.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.595
But, you know, it's really...

41:36.662 --> 41:38.396
it's really this
very fragile thing.

41:38.463 --> 41:41.800
Is that the kind of stuff
you talk about with Megan

41:41.867 --> 41:42.801
at lunch?

41:44.069 --> 41:45.470
DON:
Wait, ho-ho-hold on.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.138
You and Megan went out to lunch?

41:49.074 --> 41:52.043
Oh, please tell me you ordered
something other than white food.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.411
( laughing )

41:53.478 --> 41:55.013
This was a meal shared

41:55.080 --> 41:58.183
by two inquisitive
minds in an...

41:58.249 --> 41:59.585
intellectual pursuit.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.719
Of course it was--

42:00.786 --> 42:02.754
like all your lunches
with David.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.522
Oh, and with Colby.

42:05.423 --> 42:06.758
LARRY:
A gamma ray burst

42:06.825 --> 42:10.195
will release more energy
in ten seconds

42:10.261 --> 42:12.564
than the sun
will emit

42:12.631 --> 42:16.001
in its entire
ten-billion-year life span.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.903
I got it,
what's the Hulk's real name?

42:17.969 --> 42:19.871
-CHARLIE: Uh, Bruce Banner.
-That's right.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.506
I mean, didn't gamma rays

42:21.573 --> 42:22.874
turn him into the Hulk?

42:22.941 --> 42:25.176
They come from the furthest ends
of the universe,

42:25.243 --> 42:29.447
and after 45 years, we are still
uncertain of their origin.

42:29.514 --> 42:30.982
( patting Larry's back )

42:33.551 --> 42:36.521
And?

42:36.588 --> 42:39.891
And we're closer to an answer
on that

42:39.958 --> 42:44.129
than the three of you
are ever gonna get on this.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.937
Megan?

42:52.003 --> 42:53.538
And Larry.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.741
Now, there's an image.
