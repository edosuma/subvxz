01:30.360 --> 01:33.395
Nice, easy
mile now, warm it up!

01:33.397 --> 01:36.066
- Take your time.
- Hurry up!

01:36.068 --> 01:39.067
Aww.

01:39.069 --> 01:41.472
It'd be so much cuter if you
were wearing little shoes.

01:41.474 --> 01:43.772
It'd be cuter if
he exploded at the end.

01:46.944 --> 01:48.444
- Excuse me.
- Bless you.

01:48.446 --> 01:50.279
- You know...
- Black lung.

01:50.281 --> 01:51.614
Did you know that pilgrims
used to think sneezing

01:51.616 --> 01:53.248
meant you were
expelling demons?

01:53.250 --> 01:55.751
- What?
- That's why I never sneeze.

01:55.753 --> 01:57.320
I want to keep them all

01:57.322 --> 01:58.855
- in my soul.
- Your soul.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.191
If I had one.

02:01.193 --> 02:03.126
<i>Twitter poll.</i>

02:03.128 --> 02:04.494
If you could stay one age
forever, what would it be?

02:04.496 --> 02:07.663
- Easy. 21.
- No way. I'd be 10.

02:07.665 --> 02:09.431
Oh, no, 10 was
the worst, man.

02:09.433 --> 02:12.001
I say, 30. It's like
the height of sophistication.

02:12.003 --> 02:14.135
- You?
- What about the age we are right now?

02:14.137 --> 02:15.638
I'd like to stay
like this forever.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.539
Seriously? I mean,
what's wrong with you?

02:17.541 --> 02:19.943
Okay, fine.
The age we are right now,

02:19.945 --> 02:21.811
but we could all live
in a house together.

02:21.813 --> 02:23.346
Okay, fine.
But without Wren, though?

02:23.348 --> 02:25.181
Yeah, obviously,
that goes without saying.

02:25.183 --> 02:27.283
Super funny.
Like, whoa.

02:27.285 --> 02:31.221
Guys, the
dudebros in their natural habitat.

02:31.223 --> 02:33.823
Let's observe, shall we?

02:33.825 --> 02:36.325
Hey, Tom!
So, what's the plan tonight?

02:36.327 --> 02:38.694
- Big plans...
- Hey.

02:38.696 --> 02:41.698
- It's top secret.
- Oh, I see. A circle jerk?

02:42.968 --> 02:45.068
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey, Kyle.

02:45.070 --> 02:47.302
So, what's the big secret?

02:47.304 --> 02:49.138
I mean, I could tell you,

02:49.140 --> 02:51.508
but then, I'd have to kill you.

02:51.510 --> 02:52.741
- Okay, buddy.
- Yeah.

02:52.743 --> 02:54.843
Yeah. It's very intriguing.

02:54.845 --> 02:58.046
You guys, I got to go get my
sister, but I love you. Bye.

02:58.048 --> 02:59.548
See you later.
I'll pick you up tonight.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.381
- I'm sorry.
- Bye. It's okay.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.397
Bumped into
Coach Sanders today.

03:17.399 --> 03:22.204
Said your 1,600-meter time
is really improving.

03:24.173 --> 03:28.641
All that training's
paying off.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.576
Nice work, sweetheart.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.813
Did you tell them Delores
Constantino quit the team?

03:33.815 --> 03:34.816
Why?

03:35.850 --> 03:37.752
She's pregnant.

03:39.286 --> 03:43.155
What is she
planning to do, now?

03:43.157 --> 03:45.226
She's gonna drop out,
and keep the baby.

03:48.496 --> 03:52.532
I assume Wren is gonna be
at Katie's tonight?

03:52.534 --> 03:54.500
Yeah. So?

03:54.502 --> 03:55.737
So, what are you guys
gonna do?

03:57.971 --> 04:01.873
You know, drink a lot of
vodka, and meet guys online.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.609
Funny. Very funny.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.010
- Can I come?
- Not a chance.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.480
- You said I could come next time.
- I lied.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.589
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.725
Do you think I could
hang out with you guys?

04:19.726 --> 04:23.129
Uh, yeah,
not tonight, grasshopper.

04:23.131 --> 04:24.930
Sorry. Maybe next time.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.132
Oh, I wore the shirt
you gave me to school.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.667
Got sent
to the principal's office.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.002
- Well done, man. Yes.
- Hey.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.203
- Hey.
- Goodbye.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.573
Bye.

04:33.575 --> 04:35.674
Love me.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.712
Bye, Lizzie.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.302
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:03.304 --> 05:06.939
Don't make any noise.
It's dormant.

05:06.941 --> 05:08.943
Just another exciting Friday
night at the Jensens.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.451
<i>No? Oh?</i>

05:18.453 --> 05:20.218
Yeah, it's girl gaze porn.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.586
You know how they have POV porn?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.254
- Yeah.
- This one's from our perspective.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.357
- I don't want to see that.
- For sure.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.160
Oh, my God.

05:27.162 --> 05:28.728
Do you think she likes that?

05:28.730 --> 05:30.429
- Oh, my God!
- No!

05:30.431 --> 05:32.430
Oh, God! Once you see it,
you just can't unsee it.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.771
What the hell is he doing?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.507
He's probably just
looking for another bottle.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.643
- Sometimes, I wish I could just leave.
- I know.

05:44.645 --> 05:48.881
Why don't we just all leave? Get
out of this stupid town together.

05:48.883 --> 05:51.083
Where would we go?

05:51.085 --> 05:54.853
I have friends in Paris. We
could totally stay with them.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.323
What friends?
You've never been to Paris.

05:57.325 --> 06:01.360
- My mom has friends there, idiot.
- Don't I wish.

06:01.362 --> 06:04.429
I'll just be stuck here
forever, in this shithole.

06:09.337 --> 06:13.538
Seriously! No, I think you and
Carl would make an adorable couple.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.242
It's "Kyle,"
and I don't like him.

06:16.244 --> 06:19.612
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever, you know.

06:19.614 --> 06:21.680
But we all know
that you wish you were

06:21.682 --> 06:24.449
at their little secret
sausage fest right now.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.218
No.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.454
But I do know
what their secret is.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.256
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.492
So, they're getting together
tonight at Tom's house

06:33.494 --> 06:36.498
in his garage,
to summon Slender Man.

06:38.299 --> 06:40.232
- Creepy.
- Who's Slender Man?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.869
Yeah, he's the guy who makes
all those kids disappear.

06:42.871 --> 06:44.369
Why have I not heard of this?

06:44.371 --> 06:46.805
That's a much
longer conversation.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.307
- Listen.
- Troll...

06:49.309 --> 06:53.345
"Slender Man can manifest
in a variety of forms.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.881
"Certain accounts speak
of a hypnotic power

06:55.883 --> 06:59.151
"that renders his victims
helpless to stop themselves

06:59.153 --> 07:04.189
"from walking into
waiting arms.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.692
"While his origins and motives
are completely unknown,

07:07.694 --> 07:10.629
"he preys upon innocent youth.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.398
"Once you see him, you're his.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.936
"Some he takes,
some he doesn't.

07:16.938 --> 07:22.574
"Nobody knows why he takes who he
takes, or why he leaves who he leaves.

07:22.576 --> 07:26.881
"But the ones he leaves behind
are messed up forever."

07:28.883 --> 07:32.154
All right, here it is.
"How to summon Slender Man."

07:36.357 --> 07:39.628
- Guys, we so have to do this.
- We actually don't.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.893
Actually.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.297
If they're doing it,
we're doing it.

07:44.299 --> 07:46.064
This feels wrong.
This feels like

07:46.066 --> 07:48.434
Russian malware-y
virus-type shit.

07:48.436 --> 07:50.105
Come on,
don't be such a wuss.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.045
"Those who hear
the three bells toll

07:59.047 --> 08:01.247
"accept his invitation.

08:01.249 --> 08:04.216
"When you hear the first,
you must close your eyes,

08:04.218 --> 08:06.218
"keeping words unspoken.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.622
"If one wants to hear,
you must listen closely,

08:09.624 --> 08:12.223
"for they are soft
and distant.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.826
"With eyes still closed
and mind wide open,

08:14.828 --> 08:17.795
"clear your thoughts
and await the second,

08:17.797 --> 08:21.869
"opening your eyes only once
you've heard the third."

08:23.638 --> 08:24.773
Hmm.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.113
Are you serious? This is...

09:07.115 --> 09:08.216
Shh!

09:57.064 --> 10:00.200
What a stupid video. Honestly.

10:20.722 --> 10:22.254
Can we do
something else?

10:22.256 --> 10:24.325
- Let's watch a movie.
- Yeah.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.668
This burial ground dates back

12:16.670 --> 12:18.504
all the way
to the Revolutionary War,

12:18.506 --> 12:22.140
which was 1775 to 1783.

12:22.142 --> 12:26.812
In 2004, it was put on the National
Registry of Historical Sites,

12:26.814 --> 12:29.413
which was very exciting.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.850
Initially, all of this land
belonged to Thomas Clifton,

12:32.852 --> 12:37.022
who left it to the town of
Winsford in his will in 1674.

12:40.328 --> 12:43.861
You guys, I threw up twice this
morning, before I got on the bus.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.898
Is it Carl's?

12:45.900 --> 12:49.571
Ha. That's hilarious, and also,
scientifically impossible.

12:51.005 --> 12:52.605
Have you been
having nightmares?

12:52.607 --> 12:53.772
Mmm-mmm.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.173
Have you?

12:55.175 --> 12:56.176
Uh...

12:57.078 --> 12:58.911
About what?

12:58.913 --> 13:04.182
It's nothing, really.
It's just that video.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.454
...stronger and
more durable, which is also...

13:11.492 --> 13:13.359
Hey, Katie?

13:13.361 --> 13:16.131
Katie, are you okay?

13:17.198 --> 13:18.366
Yes.

14:15.390 --> 14:17.422
Katie? Cut this shit out, man.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.091
All right, we're all prisoners
because of you.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.826
So, none of you saw
where she went?

14:21.828 --> 14:24.196
- No.
- Really?

14:24.198 --> 14:27.700
- Damn it.
- I mean, where is she?

14:27.702 --> 14:30.804
Yeah, she still hasn't
answered any of my texts.

14:33.775 --> 14:35.309
Why are the police here?

14:39.179 --> 14:41.015
Oh, shit.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.552
You see her?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.690
Mmm-mmm.

15:21.555 --> 15:24.121
<i>Teenager Katie
Jensen was last seen on Wednesday,</i>

15:24.123 --> 15:27.392
<i>during a school field trip to
the historic Clifton Cemetery.</i>

15:27.394 --> 15:29.861
<i>As of now,
local police have no leads,</i>

15:29.863 --> 15:32.330
<i>but are questioning friends
and family members</i>

15:32.332 --> 15:35.701
<i>in hopes of gaining insight into
the reason for her disappearance.</i>

15:35.703 --> 15:39.941
<i>Citizens with any information are being
urged to contact local authorities.</i>

15:45.011 --> 15:47.746
You should tell me
what really happened to Katie.

15:47.748 --> 15:50.382
We never keep secrets
from each other.

15:50.384 --> 15:53.652
How would you know? You don't know that.
Do your homework.

15:53.654 --> 15:55.821
Come on,
I don't want to talk about it.

15:55.823 --> 15:59.126
It was a boy, right? You think I'll tell?
I'd never tell.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.893
You'd totally tell.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.162
Not Mom and Dad.

16:03.164 --> 16:04.465
Totally Mom and Dad.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.966
Maybe.

16:06.968 --> 16:09.368
Definitely, but you get points
for honesty.

16:09.370 --> 16:11.239
So, tell me.

16:14.976 --> 16:17.712
You don't know. Do you?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.245
Just do your work, Lizzie.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.249
- Hallie.
- Lizzie.

16:23.884 --> 16:25.086
Fine.

16:28.923 --> 16:32.423
I could stay home alone,
you know. I'm old enough.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.395
Physical age, maybe.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.149
Did you hear that?

16:59.953 --> 17:02.222
Hey, Mom? Dad!

17:04.324 --> 17:06.958
Hey, Mom?

17:08.661 --> 17:09.794
Hallie, someone's in here.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.366
Stay here. Okay? Don't move.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.314
Hallie? Hallie,
what is it? Hallie...

18:43.724 --> 18:46.058
We called the police!

18:53.866 --> 18:57.467
Katie? Katie?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.437
<i>Police emergency.
Can I help you?</i>

18:59.439 --> 19:00.738
Katie.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.313
Katie, you here?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.602
Mr. Jensen?

19:29.737 --> 19:31.339
Where's my daughter?

19:32.406 --> 19:33.674
I don't know.

19:36.375 --> 19:40.145
- Is Katie here? Are you hiding her?
- No.

19:40.147 --> 19:41.314
I don't know where she is.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.955
It's all your fault.

19:49.957 --> 19:51.755
She was never
into this stuff.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.325
- All this occult stuff.
- Hallie?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.462
Lizzie, stay back.

19:57.131 --> 19:59.132
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

20:00.801 --> 20:02.801
- Where is she?
- No! Don't! Hallie!

20:02.803 --> 20:04.136
- Where is my daughter?
- Hallie!

20:04.138 --> 20:05.603
- Lizzie!
- Where is she?

20:07.774 --> 20:08.939
Let's go.

20:11.745 --> 20:13.311
- Stay the hell away from my family!
- Hey, hey, hey!

20:13.313 --> 20:15.514
You hear me, Jensen?

20:50.150 --> 20:51.991
Did you guys really try
and summon Slender Man?

20:53.219 --> 20:54.552
Why?

20:54.554 --> 20:55.654
We chickened out.

20:56.724 --> 20:58.156
You chickened out.

20:58.158 --> 20:59.957
- I chickened out?
- You chickened out.

20:59.959 --> 21:00.824
- I remember you being the one...
- He chickened out.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.427
...that chickened out.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.564
Katie's father broke into
my house last night.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.199
- What?
- What?

21:08.201 --> 21:10.535
He said something about Katie
being into the occult,

21:10.537 --> 21:12.203
and then he blamed us
for getting her into it.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.805
Wait, what did he mean about
Katie being into the occult?

21:13.807 --> 21:16.408
I don't know.
He was so wasted.

21:16.410 --> 21:20.846
This could be
the next wrinkle in the story.

21:20.848 --> 21:22.680
I don't want
to play this game.

21:22.682 --> 21:27.686
It's not a game.
Katie's missing.

21:27.688 --> 21:30.021
Yeah, and we know things
that nobody else knows.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.723
What do we know?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.692
We know that
she watched that video.

21:33.694 --> 21:38.196
Look, we all watched that video.
It didn't do anything.

21:38.198 --> 21:40.119
When are we gonna admit
that Katie was kidnapped?

21:42.334 --> 21:45.904
Somebody has her.

21:45.906 --> 21:49.541
Yeah, but when we watched that
video, it affected all of us.

21:49.543 --> 21:51.408
Something happened.
I felt it.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.812
- I didn't see anything.
- I didn't see anything, either.

21:53.814 --> 21:58.783
Didn't say I saw it.
I said I felt it.

21:58.785 --> 21:59.887
And I think you did, too.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.921
And I'm damn sure
that Katie felt it,

22:03.923 --> 22:06.660
and that's why
she disappeared!

22:23.110 --> 22:25.342
This is a bad idea.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.912
It's just a quick
look around, okay?

22:27.914 --> 22:32.917
Plus, you know what, he's probably
totally passed out by now.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.785
I don't know, I just feel like
there's got to be something.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.522
- You know, like a clue, maybe, or...
- You're crazy.

22:36.524 --> 22:40.492
You don't realize
how he was last night.

22:40.494 --> 22:44.665
The back door is always unlocked
for when Katie gets home late.

22:45.497 --> 22:47.367
Just saying.

22:50.704 --> 22:53.341
Great. Then let's go.

23:21.569 --> 23:23.270
Told ya.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.718
Wren?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.856
Hi. Hi, Mr. Jensen.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.204
What are you doing here?

23:59.206 --> 24:01.805
Well, I just wanted
to come down

24:01.807 --> 24:05.612
and see if there was anything
that I could do, if I could help

24:06.478 --> 24:07.914
in any way?

24:11.084 --> 24:14.121
Anything I could do.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.223
I miss her.

24:19.093 --> 24:21.362
People just don't disappear.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.298
You want to come in?

24:27.300 --> 24:29.270
That'd be great.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.425
She's really gone.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.263
The police must have
taken her laptop.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.942
What is all this?

25:31.698 --> 25:35.468
She used to keep
cigarettes and stuff in here.

26:01.727 --> 26:02.830
Let's just take it.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.982
Okay. Here's the last
site she visited.

26:25.285 --> 26:27.552
What am I looking at?

26:27.554 --> 26:28.555
Here, click it.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.356
Okay.

26:52.245 --> 26:56.347
Oh, shit.

26:56.349 --> 27:00.283
All these, like, town names,
and dates and stuff.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.287
Click another one.

27:03.223 --> 27:06.390
<i>Okay, guys. Let's go.</i>

27:06.392 --> 27:08.860
<i>I am Slender Man.</i>

27:08.862 --> 27:12.097
<i>- Dude.
- Guys, guys.</i>

27:12.099 --> 27:14.234
<i>Whoa, whoa.
What is that? What is that?</i>

27:15.301 --> 27:16.700
<i>I'm so scared. I'm so...</i>

27:20.640 --> 27:23.273
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

27:23.275 --> 27:24.775
<i>- Oh, God!
- Dude, he's there!</i>

27:24.777 --> 27:25.879
<i>I can't...</i>

27:27.848 --> 27:30.651
- It's him.
- I don't like this.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.121
- Wait, look.
- What?

27:36.622 --> 27:38.324
AleeyKat93.

27:39.860 --> 27:41.559
Jeez.

27:41.561 --> 27:43.964
They went back and forth,
like, a gazillion times.

27:45.398 --> 27:48.669
"I knew he was there
before I saw him."

27:50.237 --> 27:52.506
It's like they're
comparing experiences.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.876
Wait, look.
Katie posted a video.

27:57.878 --> 28:00.514
Look, it's from the
night before she disappeared.

28:28.175 --> 28:31.679
- What was that?
- What did you see?

28:34.013 --> 28:36.781
What did you see?

28:36.783 --> 28:40.721
- I don't know, I...
- I don't know, either.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.993
- I talked to her.
- Who?

30:28.995 --> 30:31.596
AleeyKat93.

30:31.598 --> 30:33.931
It was that girl that Katie was
talking to on that website.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.700
I messaged her,
and she replied.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.468
You went back
on that website?

30:38.471 --> 30:42.474
She told me everything. He gets
in your head like a virus.

30:42.476 --> 30:44.074
What kind of virus?

30:44.076 --> 30:45.810
Like a computer virus
that infects your hard drive,

30:45.812 --> 30:47.744
but instead of your
hard drive, it's your brain.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.446
- Wren, you're gonna need to slow down...
- No, listen to me.

30:49.448 --> 30:53.485
Once the virus takes hold,
he's got you. It's done.

30:53.487 --> 30:56.987
Some he haunts,
some he drives mad.

30:56.989 --> 31:00.493
- And others, he takes, like...
- Like what?

31:01.327 --> 31:03.095
Katie.

31:05.164 --> 31:07.266
Listen, I know that this...

31:08.234 --> 31:10.534
This is gonna sound crazy,

31:10.536 --> 31:14.772
but AleeyKat said we can

31:14.774 --> 31:17.742
"unveil ourselves."

31:17.744 --> 31:19.510
Okay, if we just surrender
something to him

31:19.512 --> 31:22.746
that has personal meaning,
something that we truly love.

31:22.748 --> 31:23.908
What the hell does that mean?

31:25.785 --> 31:27.383
We can contact Slender Man.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.654
Why would we do that?

31:29.656 --> 31:32.756
To get Katie back. Hello?

31:32.758 --> 31:35.292
Katie did it, and the next
day, she was just gone.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.529
Okay, Katie asked Slender Man

31:37.531 --> 31:39.597
- to take her?
- Yes.

31:39.599 --> 31:41.699
Why would she do that?

31:41.701 --> 31:45.569
I don't know. You know, maybe
she had an alcoholic father,

31:45.571 --> 31:48.673
and maybe she hated her life,
and maybe she talked about

31:48.675 --> 31:50.410
running away all the time,
you know?

31:51.777 --> 31:55.780
Guys, the police have
no leads.

31:55.782 --> 31:58.683
Right? Right?

31:58.685 --> 32:04.120
So, even if the odds
are a million-to-one

32:04.122 --> 32:06.890
that any of this is real,
or that...

32:06.892 --> 32:10.661
That he has anything to do
with Katie's disappearance,

32:10.663 --> 32:13.266
we owe it to her to try.

33:21.634 --> 33:23.002
This should work.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.176
I guess that I'll...

33:31.910 --> 33:34.180
Go first, then.

33:39.051 --> 33:40.821
I...

33:42.288 --> 33:45.589
I made this in pottery class,
when I was five.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.958
This is a picture of me
and my dad.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.261
It's the only one I have
where we're together.

33:50.263 --> 33:53.296
It was taken a few months
before he died.

33:53.298 --> 33:56.168
My grandma made this
when Lizzie was born.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.735
She died eight years ago.

34:09.649 --> 34:14.018
Surprised you didn't bring one
of your trophies, or medals.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.857
You said it had to be
something I cared about, so...

34:22.527 --> 34:24.263
I brought this.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.708
Lights out.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.888
Okay, so...

34:51.889 --> 34:54.857
Listen, once we ask
for Katie's return,

34:54.859 --> 34:58.328
we have to keep these
blindfolds on, all right?

34:58.330 --> 35:01.232
AleeyKat said not to look
in his face.

35:01.234 --> 35:02.268
If you do,

35:03.236 --> 35:05.703
you're messed up forever.

35:05.705 --> 35:10.410
It's different for everyone, but it
only ends in insanity, or death.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.783
Okay.

35:35.569 --> 35:39.235
Okay, hold my hand, hold my hand.
You hold her hand, too, okay?

35:39.237 --> 35:41.274
We all have to hold hands.

35:44.611 --> 35:46.710
How long do you think
we're gonna give this?

35:46.712 --> 35:49.949
As long as it takes.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.560
Keep your blindfolds on.

36:14.207 --> 36:16.741
Do you hear that?

36:25.852 --> 36:27.583
Guys, we shouldn't be
doing this.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.587
- She's right.
- It's too late.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.051
- Chloe! Chloe!
- Chloe, come back!

37:01.053 --> 37:02.853
- Come on! Chloe!
- Come back, Chloe!

37:30.716 --> 37:31.951
Chloe?

37:38.357 --> 37:39.525
Hallie!

38:00.580 --> 38:03.614
Oh, my God! Hallie.

38:03.616 --> 38:05.216
- Where's Chloe?
- I don't know!

38:05.218 --> 38:07.518
I told her to keep
her freaking blindfold on.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.456
- She...
- Chloe!

38:32.877 --> 38:36.413
- Oh, my God, Chloe!
- Chloe!

38:36.415 --> 38:39.451
Jesus, Chloe, you scared us
to death! Where did you go?

38:42.120 --> 38:43.622
I lost my shoe.

38:44.424 --> 38:45.424
It's okay.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.125
What happened?

38:49.127 --> 38:52.362
- You saw him.
- Wren.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.697
Chloe, I told you not to
take your blindfold off.

38:54.699 --> 38:58.101
- Did you see him?
- Nothing happened.

38:58.103 --> 39:01.605
I just got scared. Okay?

39:01.607 --> 39:05.007
Something happened, and she knows it.
Something happened back there!

39:05.009 --> 39:09.779
You're right. We didn't get Katie back.
That's what happened.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.785
Come on.

39:16.656 --> 39:18.091
Wait, guys.
Wait for me.

39:58.598 --> 39:59.598
Hal?

40:00.466 --> 40:01.466
Go away.

40:04.904 --> 40:06.373
Are you okay?

40:07.973 --> 40:10.308
I'm fine!

40:10.310 --> 40:13.913
I'm fine! Just...
I'll see you later, okay?

40:15.882 --> 40:18.818
Just go to sleep.
We'll hang tomorrow, okay?

43:58.536 --> 44:00.337
Hey.

44:00.339 --> 44:02.641
What's up with Chloe?
It's been a few days.

44:07.346 --> 44:10.984
She's fine. Just a cold.

44:30.636 --> 44:33.640
Hey, Hallie! Wait up.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.141
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:38.143 --> 44:41.546
How you holding up? I mean,
with Katie and everything.

44:42.781 --> 44:44.248
Um...

44:44.250 --> 44:48.085
Well, I'm okay. I...

44:48.087 --> 44:50.920
Hey, tomorrow's Friday.

44:50.922 --> 44:53.089
We got the weekend coming up.

44:53.091 --> 44:56.928
I was thinking,
maybe we should do something.

45:00.165 --> 45:02.833
Yeah, sure.

45:02.835 --> 45:06.773
You want to come over tomorrow night?
To my place?

45:15.348 --> 45:16.482
Hallie.

45:20.118 --> 45:21.153
Hallie?

45:23.790 --> 45:25.391
- What?
- Are you okay?

45:30.629 --> 45:33.131
Yeah, that's cool.
Your place?

45:33.765 --> 45:34.765
Sure.

45:37.435 --> 45:38.638
I'll see you later?

45:39.504 --> 45:40.672
Okay.

49:07.312 --> 49:11.181
Hallie. Hallie, can you...
Can you hear me? I...

49:34.306 --> 49:35.507
Hello?

50:27.658 --> 50:29.458
Oh, God.

51:09.835 --> 51:13.406
Please! Please help!

51:22.681 --> 51:25.051
No! No, no!

51:26.551 --> 51:28.386
No!

51:29.087 --> 51:31.122
Please!

51:33.158 --> 51:35.194
No, no!

52:14.065 --> 52:16.106
Miss, are you all right?

52:18.002 --> 52:20.271
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

52:33.451 --> 52:34.587
I'm sorry.

52:35.587 --> 52:37.790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

52:46.098 --> 52:48.130
Hey. Are you not getting
my texts, or something?

52:48.132 --> 52:49.898
- Look, Wren, I don't...
- No, no, no.

52:49.900 --> 52:52.603
Look at me. I found proof.
I found the proof. Right?

52:52.605 --> 52:54.304
Look, look, look,
I understand.

52:54.306 --> 52:55.904
I understand now, what AleeyKat
was trying to tell me.

52:55.906 --> 52:58.107
It's proof. Read this.
Read this with me.

52:58.109 --> 53:01.011
Okay, it says, "paranormal
contact with bioelectric systems

53:01.013 --> 53:04.013
"often results
in a symbiotic relationship.

53:04.015 --> 53:08.018
"The effects on host organisms have
been well documented and manifest

53:08.020 --> 53:11.654
"in various forms, such as..."

53:11.656 --> 53:13.790
- Wren. Wren. Calm down.
- No, no, no.

53:13.792 --> 53:17.125
Shh. Listen to me. "Personality
change, bizarre behavior,

53:17.127 --> 53:20.998
"mental illness, psychosis,
loss of contact with reality,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.601
"self-mutilation, and suicide.

53:24.603 --> 53:28.804
"And nonspecific dissolution."

53:28.806 --> 53:30.975
They just disappear.

53:33.277 --> 53:35.478
Has...

53:35.480 --> 53:41.683
Has anything weird happened to
you lately, or strange, or...

53:41.685 --> 53:43.488
Do not hold out on me.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.759
- Okay, so, I was talking with Tom...
- Tom?

53:48.761 --> 53:52.429
- What's wrong with Tom?
- What? Who gives a shit about Tom, Hal?

53:52.431 --> 53:53.929
- Just tell me what happened.
- Okay.

53:53.931 --> 53:56.868
I thought I saw something
in the trees.

53:59.036 --> 54:00.804
It was him.

54:00.806 --> 54:03.572
And, what about Chloe?
Have you talked to her?

54:03.574 --> 54:06.842
I don't know. I've called her house, and
her mom keeps telling me she's sick.

54:06.844 --> 54:10.882
Last time I called, she pretty much
flat out told me to stay away.

54:13.152 --> 54:15.484
We need to go there right now.

54:15.486 --> 54:17.219
Wren, there's nothing
we can do, and I have track.

54:17.221 --> 54:19.658
- I can't just leave.
- Track?

54:22.060 --> 54:24.697
I thought you didn't care
about track anymore.

54:26.031 --> 54:27.533
I thought you cared
about Chloe.

55:18.515 --> 55:19.550
Chloe.

55:30.562 --> 55:32.931
Chloe. Wake up.

55:35.600 --> 55:37.002
What the hell
was that?

55:39.004 --> 55:40.603
I don't know, but I told...

55:40.605 --> 55:42.471
I knew that she saw his face
in the woods, you know?

55:42.473 --> 55:44.806
I knew that she was
lying, too. I knew that.

55:44.808 --> 55:46.711
I don't want to
do this anymore.

55:48.312 --> 55:51.413
Yeah, I don't, either.

55:51.415 --> 55:53.917
But I'm stuck in it.

55:53.919 --> 55:56.522
And you are, too.
You just don't realize it yet.

55:59.324 --> 56:02.324
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing a "thing."

56:02.326 --> 56:03.495
All right.

56:05.129 --> 56:09.000
"All right"?
Yeah, don't say "All right."

56:10.301 --> 56:13.638
We only watched
the website video.

56:14.973 --> 56:19.208
But Chloe,
she saw him in the woods.

56:19.210 --> 56:22.744
- Wren, I can't keep...
- Read the book that I showed you.

56:22.746 --> 56:27.417
You will see the body count, okay?
Thousands of disappearances.

56:27.419 --> 56:32.288
Search parties, faces on milk cartons.
I'm not making this shit up.

56:32.290 --> 56:36.125
And it all happened
exactly like AleeyKat said.

56:36.127 --> 56:38.527
It's probably some 50-year-old dude
living in his parents' basement,

56:38.529 --> 56:41.063
getting off on e-mailing
teenage girls every day.

56:41.065 --> 56:43.400
Did you ever think of that?
Did you?

56:43.402 --> 56:46.368
So, you think that you can
just go back to real life?

56:46.370 --> 56:49.337
Yeah, I do. In fact,
I have a real-life date

56:49.339 --> 56:53.842
with real-life Tom tonight.
In real life.

56:53.844 --> 56:56.011
He's not gonna stop!

56:56.013 --> 56:58.647
And going on a date
with fucking Abercrombie Tom

56:58.649 --> 57:00.449
is not gonna change anything!

57:00.451 --> 57:03.087
You know I'm right!

57:07.859 --> 57:09.361
You know I'm right.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.303
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:25.437 --> 58:26.735
Sorry I'm late.

58:26.737 --> 58:29.772
- No worries. Come on in.
- Thanks.

58:29.774 --> 58:31.406
I thought I had
the wrong house

58:31.408 --> 58:34.310
because there weren't any cars
in the driveway.

58:34.312 --> 58:38.516
Yeah, my dad's at this business thing,
and Mom's at her book club, so...

58:41.185 --> 58:42.985
So, nobody's home?

58:42.987 --> 58:45.991
No, it's just us.
Is that okay?

58:48.292 --> 58:49.495
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:59.638 --> 59:01.840
I didn't know you were
such a music geek.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.172
Hmm.

59:09.147 --> 59:14.253
So, this is my dad's,
but I like it.

59:15.319 --> 59:16.388
Cool.

59:22.660 --> 59:24.960
Do you want me to put
something else on, or...

59:24.962 --> 59:29.167
- No. This is great.
- Okay. Cool.

01:00:03.134 --> 01:00:04.900
- What?
- Do you hear that?

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.004
Yeah. It's good, right?

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:13.678
Hey.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.380
Hey, come here.

01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:32.730
What the hell?

01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:36.364
Hallie, I didn't do anything.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:39.403
I know. Oh, God.

01:00:40.672 --> 01:00:42.407
Are you okay?

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:47.578
Here.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.185
Have you told
anyone else about this?

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.833
If Katie was on some weird
Slender Man website, then

01:01:10.969 --> 01:01:13.304
who knows who she met?
I mean...

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.508
Probably some weird guy
in a van, you know?

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.978
I hate to say it.

01:01:42.734 --> 01:01:44.600
Is this it?

01:01:44.602 --> 01:01:46.770
- No, don't.
- Come on.

01:01:46.772 --> 01:01:50.138
Tom, please.
You can't go on that site.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.641
- It's just a video.
- It's not just a video.

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:55.277
Promise me you won't
ever watch that video.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:59.147
Tom, I'm serious.
Please promise.

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:02.553
Okay. Okay, I promise.

01:02:06.457 --> 01:02:08.359
Really.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:19.670
I need to go.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.817
All right, first, let's all
take a moment to observe...

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:12.821
- Tom. Hey.
- ...the exterior anatomy here.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:15.794
Tom? Tom.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:21.899
Hey. Are you okay?

01:03:30.074 --> 01:03:34.476
Now, you'll notice that the cornea
looks a little cloudy and bluish.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:38.848
That happens naturally because
of the preservation process.

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.183
So, very carefully,
with your scalpels,

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:44.252
I want you to make a slice right through
the sclera as evenly as you can.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:48.559
That's gonna separate the
anterior features of the eye.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.931
Hallie.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:10.074
- Katie?
- Hallie.

01:05:24.689 --> 01:05:25.924
Hallie.

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:29.861
Katie?

01:05:35.533 --> 01:05:36.534
Hallie!

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:50.915
- Help me, Hallie.
- Katie?

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:10.635
Katie?

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:15.373
Hallie.

01:06:16.408 --> 01:06:17.906
Katie!

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:20.074
Katie, come back!

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.743
Katie!

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:23.511
Katie!

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:24.882
Katie!

01:06:25.683 --> 01:06:27.152
Katie!

01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:30.587
Katie!

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:35.259
Katie!

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.028
Hallie, help me.

01:08:19.063 --> 01:08:20.495
Come on, breathe.

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:22.496
You're gonna be okay.

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:24.365
- Breathe...
- How long did they say?

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:26.035
- I don't know. Come on. Come on.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:08:26.037 --> 01:08:28.069
- Just breathe, sweetheart.
- Breathe, breathe.

01:08:28.072 --> 01:08:30.238
Come on. We got you.
We got you. Stay up.

01:08:30.241 --> 01:08:32.139
That's right, deep breath.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.709
- Just breathe. Deep breaths.
- Lizzie, what's going on?

01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:35.377
Oh, my God. Lizzie!

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.745
- The ambulance is on its way.
- Lizzie.

01:08:36.747 --> 01:08:38.379
Lizzie, it's okay.
Just look at me.

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:41.082
- We got you.
- It's okay, baby, it's okay.

01:08:41.085 --> 01:08:43.752
Okay, the ambulance
is on its way, honey.

01:08:43.754 --> 01:08:45.420
No. No, Lizzie!

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.589
- Lizzie, wake up! Lizzie!
- We're all here, Lizzie.

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.223
- Dad, do something!
- Where is that ambulance?

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.359
- I'm doing my best. Come on, Lizzie!
- Lizzie, wake up!

01:08:51.362 --> 01:08:53.796
- Come on, Lizzie, just breathe.
- Lizzie, wake up!

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:16.884
Blood tests are negative.
She's gonna be fine.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:19.787
They think it was just
some kind of panic attack.

01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:23.894
They want to keep her to monitor
her for at least another day.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:53.208
No. No.

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:55.613
Lizzie? Lizzie?

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:03.119
Lizzie! Lizzie!

01:12:03.121 --> 01:12:05.189
Lizzie!

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:07.492
Lizzie, please.

01:12:12.729 --> 01:12:13.897
Lizzie?

01:12:47.465 --> 01:12:48.833
<i>Hallie?</i>

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:53.134
<i>Hallie?</i>

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:55.473
Hallie, are you okay?

01:12:58.376 --> 01:12:59.775
What's the matter?

01:12:59.777 --> 01:13:01.043
Sweetheart, what's going on?

01:13:01.045 --> 01:13:05.481
Hey. She's okay.
She's okay.

01:13:05.483 --> 01:13:08.553
It's all right.
She's gonna be fine.

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:46.123
<i>Dr. Barnes, 4721.
Dr. Barnes, 4721.</i>

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:55.996
- BP 80/40.
- Let's get her moving.

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.731
- Lizzie!
- Get her moving.

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:59.734
- Lizzie!
- Let's get her moving.

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:01.904
- Where are they taking her?
- I've got to get her to the ICU.

01:14:01.906 --> 01:14:04.338
- Lizzie!
- He had no face.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:08.243
He had no face!
He had no face!

01:14:08.245 --> 01:14:09.580
He had no face!

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.317
Lizzie!

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:58.428
<i>Okay. So, now, what do I do?</i>

01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:06.270
<i>Just sacrifice something
you love.</i>

01:15:24.488 --> 01:15:25.990
Wren!

01:15:29.393 --> 01:15:32.163
Damn it, Wren!
I know you're in there!

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:35.198
Open up!

01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:59.422
Wren!

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:14.170
Wren!

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:33.324
Wren!

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:02.779
Wren, what are you doing?

01:18:05.315 --> 01:18:08.182
Wren, take my hand. Come on.

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:11.287
Wren, you're gonna fall! Wren.

01:18:22.332 --> 01:18:23.400
Wren!

01:18:27.604 --> 01:18:29.504
I'm sorry.

01:18:29.506 --> 01:18:33.740
You're sorry? That's it? That's my sister!
Why would you do that?

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:35.744
She came to me.

01:18:35.746 --> 01:18:38.114
- Wren, she's in the hospital!
- She came to me.

01:18:40.617 --> 01:18:43.118
It was before I knew.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.358
To get Lizzie back,
to make him stop,

01:18:49.865 --> 01:18:53.368
you can't just
give him something you love.

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:57.139
It's not enough.

01:18:59.041 --> 01:19:00.409
He wants us!

01:19:03.344 --> 01:19:05.147
He wants us!

01:19:22.029 --> 01:19:23.930
Hello?

01:19:28.702 --> 01:19:29.737
No.

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:35.778
That's here. That's here.

01:19:45.019 --> 01:19:46.888
Wait, wait, Hallie!

01:20:08.743 --> 01:20:10.144
No.

01:20:33.934 --> 01:20:36.205
Wren! Wren!

01:20:45.514 --> 01:20:48.814
<i>To get Lizzie back...</i>

01:20:48.816 --> 01:20:50.685
He had no face!

01:20:52.587 --> 01:20:54.419
<i>...to make him stop...</i>

01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:56.157
Hallie, are you okay?

01:20:58.494 --> 01:21:01.764
<i>...you can't just give him
something you love.</i>

01:21:04.032 --> 01:21:05.334
<i>He wants us!</i>

01:21:06.968 --> 01:21:08.605
<i>He wants us!</i>

01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:11.225
Take me.

01:25:12.547 --> 01:25:14.448
<i>Lizzie!</i>

01:25:31.232 --> 01:25:33.634
Hallie! No!

01:25:33.636 --> 01:25:36.602
Hallie! Hallie! No!

01:25:36.604 --> 01:25:39.070
- Honey! It's okay!
- Hallie! No! No!

01:25:39.072 --> 01:25:40.673
It's okay.

01:25:40.675 --> 01:25:42.941
- Nurse! Somebody help us!
- Hallie! Hallie!

01:25:42.943 --> 01:25:45.076
- Hallie!
- Can we get a nurse in here?

01:25:45.078 --> 01:25:46.945
No! No! No!

01:25:46.947 --> 01:25:48.146
Right here.

01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:50.216
<i>Hallie! No!</i>

01:25:50.218 --> 01:25:55.489

Chloe, Wren.</i>

01:25:55.491 --> 01:25:58.290
<i>There's almost
always a pattern.</i>

01:25:58.292 --> 01:26:02.294
<i>He only shows himself
just enough to infect us.</i>

01:26:02.296 --> 01:26:06.932
<i>The more fear he creates,
the more fascinated we get.</i>

01:26:06.934 --> 01:26:10.302
<i>We talk and write about him,
share pictures, click on links,</i>

01:26:10.304 --> 01:26:13.838
<i>Photoshop images.
That's how a virus works.</i>

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.674
<i>That's how it spreads.</i>

01:26:16.676 --> 01:26:20.779
<i>And some people cross the line
and actually seek him out,</i>

01:26:20.781 --> 01:26:24.115
<i>like my sister
and her friends did.</i>

01:26:24.117 --> 01:26:27.453
<i>And those messed-up people
go out and do messed-up things</i>

01:26:27.455 --> 01:26:30.192
<i>that become more stories
for people to tell.</i>

01:26:32.059 --> 01:26:35.293
<i>It's all spreading his word.
You know?</i>
