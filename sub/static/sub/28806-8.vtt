01:35.512 --> 01:36.513
What?

01:37.722 --> 01:39.432
I transferred a call to your cell.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.352
You can do that?

01:42.435 --> 01:44.646
<i>Jones,
answer the goddamn phone.</i>

01:44.729 --> 01:46.231
It's Detective Costa.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.150
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.944
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

01:51.736 --> 01:54.197
Tell me you got evidence
off that Wappinger Falls body.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.616
Otherwise, I'm going back to sleep.
Permanently.

01:56.699 --> 01:57.534
We have evidence.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.577
The local ME found hair
on the corpse's hand.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.912
But I can't examine it,

02:00.995 --> 02:03.873
because I can't get the damn body
out of Wappinger Falls.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.125
<i>Why the hell not?</i>

02:05.208 --> 02:08.419
Because your super-vigilante friend
made it into the <i> Bulletin</i>

02:08.502 --> 02:10.505
<i>and the precinct is going nuts.</i>

02:11.172 --> 02:13.049
<i>My captain wants her for questioning.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:16.427
<i>He's pulling cops off of other cases
to find her.</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:17.511
Shit.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.223
But that's got nothing
to do with the body transfer.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.559
<i>It has everything to do with you.</i>

02:23.143 --> 02:27.438
The super vigilante who found the body,
who everybody's calling my super gal pal,

02:27.522 --> 02:28.606
it's costing me clout,

02:28.690 --> 02:32.068
and I need clout to get jurisdiction
over the goddamn body.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.778
Okay, I get it.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.573
<i>I'm sorry. I'm, uh...</i>

02:37.448 --> 02:39.284
I'm having some issues of my own.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.370
<i>What? Do you have a terminal disease
or something?</i>

02:42.453 --> 02:43.538
What? No.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.498
It happens.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.002
<i>Look, just convince this woman to come in,
answer some questions,</i> or, better yet,

02:49.836 --> 02:51.838
to just... stop.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.133
Do you still have eyes on Sallinger?

02:55.216 --> 02:56.759
<i>Couple unis are watching his place.</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:59.363
<i>But they're gonna get pulled, too,
if your friend keeps this up.</i>

02:59.387 --> 03:01.014
I told you, I don't know her.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.310
- But I'll see what I can do.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

03:08.980 --> 03:10.857
Shit.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.129
- <i>What?</i>
- Where's Trish?

03:15.153 --> 03:17.697
<i>She can't talk now.
She's in the middle of a new promo.</i>

03:20.658 --> 03:23.661
Gillian! Call Trish until she answers.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.623
I'm on
my state law-mandated break.

03:27.957 --> 03:31.628
When I wear this merino wool wrap,
I feel ready to take on the world.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.338
Not yet, you're not.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.132
Now, some of you
might remember this pin,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.469
as the one I wore
on season three of <i>It's Patsy.</i>

03:39.552 --> 03:42.138
Mmm. If you order now,
you get one free.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.099
Get one for yourself
or for that special Patsy friend...

03:45.183 --> 03:48.144
<i>Some people are born
to be out front.</i>

03:48.228 --> 03:53.274
<i>They love the attention:
the good, the bad, the ugly.</i>

03:53.358 --> 03:55.109
The red light means we're shooting.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.321
<i>Luckily, I don't give a shit
what people think about me.</i>

04:00.865 --> 04:02.617
What are you doing here?

04:02.700 --> 04:05.703
- I need to talk to Trish.
- Well, it will have to wait.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.413
This can't wait.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.541
- What is it?
- You recognize this pose?

04:10.625 --> 04:11.625
Oh.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.213
- Oh, no!
- I know.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.966
Her costume is a disaster.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.469
Once again,
you've hit the nail on the head.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.513
It should have a theme,
something relatable.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.975
Like cats. The Internet is gaga over cats.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.728
- She should never have done this.
- Agreed.

04:30.812 --> 04:34.691
Not without her publicist, me, of course.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.152
You both could use my help.
Garner a little public support.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.922
Perfect gift.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.408
Get one for yourself and one
for that special Patsy fan in your life.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.451
- Shh!
- I can hardly believe it myself,

04:45.535 --> 04:49.664
but it looks like this pin is selling out
super fast, so you better get on it.

04:49.747 --> 04:53.084
<i>By 7:00 p.m.
tonight, a life will end because of you.</i>

04:54.502 --> 04:58.631
<i>You think "super" means "superior."
It doesn't and you're not.</i>

04:58.715 --> 05:00.174
Hey, turn that off.

05:02.677 --> 05:07.640
<i>I'm going to prove it.
Your hero charade will end where it began.</i>

05:10.101 --> 05:12.437
What's the surprise
you have in store for us?

05:12.520 --> 05:15.356
Right. But first,
I think we should take a quick break.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.985
I thought Sallinger
was under police surveillance.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.779
He must have gotten past them.
Or he shot the video earlier.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.615
- Maybe he's toying with you?
- That's not his style.

05:24.699 --> 05:28.036
<i>By 7:00 p.m. tonight,
a life will end because of you.</i>

05:29.162 --> 05:31.873
<i>You think "super" means "superior."</i>

05:31.956 --> 05:34.083
<i>- It doesn't...</i>
- Okay. So all of his past victims

05:34.167 --> 05:35.710
have been men, which means...

05:36.127 --> 05:38.421
one of these two guys is his target?

05:38.504 --> 05:41.966
<i>Your hero charade
will end where it began.</i>

05:43.092 --> 05:46.637
What? Erased?
I didn't even touch anything.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.931
It's an InstaYap video.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.642
You get two views and then it's gone.
Everybody knows that.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.643
I didn't.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.189
Well, that's 'cause I handle
your social media profile so efficiently.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.610
Why did I have to humiliate him?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.695
I just had to gloat.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.781
No, this is who he is.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.033
And because we are who we are,
we'll stop him.

06:07.116 --> 06:12.663
No. No, no, no. No. Jessica will stop him.
You have a promotion to do.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.628
All right.
Let's get back on the air, guys!

06:19.962 --> 06:23.257
My baby girl knows the show must go on.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.011
- Ready, Freddy, and raring to go.
- Great.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.471
And three, two...

06:29.097 --> 06:33.476
Welcome back.
Now, I have a surprise for you today.

06:33.559 --> 06:37.939
A very special guest host
in honor of Mother's Day.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.899
Mother's Day is six months away.

06:39.982 --> 06:43.486
Giving us plenty of time to shop
for that perfect Mother's Day gift, Grace.

06:44.487 --> 06:49.075
Now, would you all please make welcome,
my guiding light,

06:49.158 --> 06:53.287
the wind beneath my wings, Dorothy Walker!

06:53.371 --> 06:58.876
My mom. Come on up, Mom!
Come on! Yeah, come on.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.089
Oh, my God.
Patsy, you're so sweet.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.257
Aw!

07:04.340 --> 07:07.969
Now, this woman
has taught me everything I know.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.512
Have fun, you two!

07:11.389 --> 07:12.390
Um...

07:14.559 --> 07:20.064
Uh, well, Grace, are you ready to see
where Trish got all her charm?

07:20.606 --> 07:21.983
Couldn't be more ready.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.613
- Where to?
- Sallinger's, to confirm he's gone.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.116
I'll head to Hudson Street Market,

07:30.199 --> 07:32.243
see if I can find out
when he shot that video.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.328
It was this morning.
Breakfasts were on the table.

07:34.412 --> 07:38.458
- I'll drop you along the way.
- Go as Trish, all right? Not Beanie Girl.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.751
"Beanie Girl"?

07:40.835 --> 07:44.797
That front-page photo caused a shitstorm.
The NYPD wants you for questioning.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.757
The paparazzi just found me, so...

07:46.841 --> 07:49.260
If the cops just find you,
I'm gonna lose a partner.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.761
And I just got used to having one.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.638
I'll stick to the shadows.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.808
And the name Beanie Girl
will never be spoken again.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.727
I can't agree to that.

08:03.191 --> 08:07.612
Honey, please, no work.
Be present for our child.

08:08.404 --> 08:13.075
Here she is, all the way
from an orphanage in Burundi.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.678
Hey, darling.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.038
Now, remember,
the first three weeks

08:17.121 --> 08:19.290
will be a little bewildering for her.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.294
The cultural change is enormous.

08:23.377 --> 08:27.006
But patience and time can help her
adjust to her new life.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.468
- Please, just put your phone away?
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.970
I have to take this.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.099
- Please, excuse us.
- Of course.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.686
Honey, is this what it's gonna be like?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.357
No. No.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.817
I promise.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.996
<i>Hey.</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:00.373
Stay away from Sallinger.

09:00.456 --> 09:04.835
The asshole just sent me a video boasting
that he's gonna kill someone at 7:00 p.m.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.421
<i>Bullshit. He's home,
parked in front of his TV.</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:09.715
<i>I just checked with surveillance
20 minutes ago.</i>

09:09.799 --> 09:12.969
No. He got past them.
He's out stalking his next victim.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.930
- <i>Send me the video.</i>
- I can't. The video's erased.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.515
Don't... Don't ask.

09:19.141 --> 09:24.230
Look, uh... Russell and I
are in the middle of some family shit.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.941
- <i>I'm sorry. Divorce sucks.</i>
- Nobody's getting divorced.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.569
<i>Good. We have less
than eight hours to find him.</i>

09:30.069 --> 09:31.829
I'm going to Sallinger's
with or without you.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.531
With you makes us both look better.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.710
- She asked to see me?
- Go on in.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.629
Did you see this?

10:29.712 --> 10:33.215
Look at this.
Breaking and entering, burglary.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.176
Where the hell was our security team?

10:35.259 --> 10:39.138
I guess, uh, somewhere
other than monitoring that camera,

10:39.221 --> 10:41.807
assuming they even knew about it.
I certainly didn't.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.186
If you're about to lecture me
about spying on my employees, don't.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.813
I have a right to know
what is going in my firm.

10:47.897 --> 10:51.817
This is the woman that's teamed
with Jessica Jones. It was on the news.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.028
That doesn't mean
that they're a team per se...

10:54.111 --> 10:55.571
They think I am weak.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.867
- They think I'll take this.
- Trust me, no one thinks that.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.537
- Who actually found the footage?
- I found it.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.249
I want this woman unmasked.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.170
I don't care how you do it.
Just get it done.

11:11.837 --> 11:12.838
Okay.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.926
Are you sure you wanna go
head to head with supers?

11:17.009 --> 11:20.513
- You know Jessica.
- Jessica hasn't done shit for this firm.

11:21.222 --> 11:25.559
And now she's... she's befriending
these... these thieves, these vigilantes.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.145
- She's trying to undermine me.
- She could be in on this.

11:28.229 --> 11:32.233
- You don't know her. She wouldn't...
- Don't defend her or her kind.

11:32.316 --> 11:37.363
Let me be clear.
This firm is my legacy and your future.

11:38.572 --> 11:42.910
I am taking this very personally,
and so should you.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.745
Find this woman.

11:45.663 --> 11:50.668
I want her outed on every single
media platform in the city.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.695
- Excuse me...
- Sit anywhere.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.697
Uh, no, I'm... I'm not here to eat.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.409
- Do you always work the morning shift?
- Just today. Filling in.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.995
Okay, good, good.
It happened this morning. Um...

12:27.288 --> 12:29.331
Well, I... I was grabbing coffee to go,

12:29.415 --> 12:33.377
and I saw, sitting at this table,
two guys and a dark-haired woman.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.587
And?

12:35.129 --> 12:36.672
And, uh, well...

12:38.591 --> 12:41.761
Well, I made eye contact
with one of the guys.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.765
And I was gonna get his number,
but I totally chickened out, so...

12:46.432 --> 12:49.518
I was wondering if...
if you could help me find them.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.273
Are you goofing on me?

12:55.149 --> 12:58.778
- What? No.
- You totally are.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.572
- This is hilarious.
- What is hilarious?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.741
You're Patsy,
teen investigative journalist.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.704
I saw that episode
where you did this same thing

13:05.743 --> 13:07.383
to find out who stole your teacher's dog.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.413
Is there some hidden cameras or something?

13:09.497 --> 13:12.458
No, I just...
I really need to find that guy.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.671
- Okay, you waited on him, right?
- Sure, a few hours ago. Good tippers.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.467
Okay, great. So if you could just give me
the name on their credit card receipt...

13:21.550 --> 13:24.053
Okay, this has got to be
some sort of <i>Candid Camera </i> thing,

13:24.136 --> 13:26.639
- or this is just too pathetic.
- I need a name.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.933
Jesus, Patsy. They paid cash.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.685
Child star psycho.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.525
Shit.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.756
Walk away, Jones.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.592
We've had eyes on this asshole
all morning.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.306
- He's watching Animal Planet.
- Nope.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.768
You are playing right into his hands.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.646
I promise you he is not upstairs.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.985
- You are getting way too high-profile.
- Tell me about it.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.533
Jones, you're gonna
open us up to a lawsuit.

14:27.616 --> 14:31.161
I'm telling you, he's here. Trust me.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.957
God damn it.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.127
Whoa. Hold on.
This is a private residence.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.671
Detective Costa, NYPD.
What are you doing here?

14:40.754 --> 14:43.716
Relax, man. I'm Joby. I'm working here.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.175
When did Sallinger leave?

14:45.926 --> 14:47.636
This morning. Early.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.055
- Probably went out the back fire escape.
- Shit.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.807
How exactly are you working here?

14:52.391 --> 14:54.685
Uh, answered a job posting last night.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.521
Two hundred bucks to come
and watch TV at this dude's home.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.273
It's a sweet gig.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.613
- Hey. I need get back to work, so...
- Wait in the hallway.

15:06.196 --> 15:09.283
- I have more questions for you.
- Sallinger's gonna do it.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.578
Why? As far as he knows,
he's in the clear. Why would he risk it?

15:12.661 --> 15:15.915
He might have heard about my trip
to his hometown and that body I dug up.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.500
"Might have"?

15:19.585 --> 15:24.548
I might have rubbed it in his face.
Literally. He knows he's done.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.927
So all this shit is his final "screw you"?

15:31.263 --> 15:33.724
I'll put a BOLO on him,
try to trace his phone.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.225
It's probably a burner.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.229
Yeah. Let's go.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.650
No, I'm gonna stay here
and wait for another video.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.318
What are you doing?

15:48.113 --> 15:50.032
I'm gonna force him to communicate.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.535
You should go.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.949
<i>Hey, asshole.</i>

16:32.533 --> 16:37.246
<i>I must have threatened
your fragile sense of masculinity.</i>

16:37.830 --> 16:40.207
<i>Do I make you feel insecure?</i>

16:40.290 --> 16:45.421
<i>All these degrees and certificates
are supposed to make you feel superior.</i>

16:47.798 --> 16:48.799
<i>Oops.</i>

16:59.143 --> 17:03.439
<i>Aw, look at that.
"Most improved."</i>

17:04.189 --> 17:06.400
<i>But you know that's bullshit.</i>

17:09.028 --> 17:10.029
Shit!

17:14.199 --> 17:16.868
<i>It's all bullshit.
And you're full of it.</i>

17:31.925 --> 17:33.427
Tell me why I protected you.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.317
Thank you. And I didn't ask you to.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.695
- If Hogarth finds out I edited that...
- We will make sure she doesn't.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.074
Seeing you on the security footage,
like, talking to her...

17:55.616 --> 17:58.077
She's not the villain
Hogarth's making her out to be.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.204
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, actually.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.249
Jesus. You know, I knew you were
into some dark shit, but this is...

18:09.129 --> 18:10.172
You know her.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.841
Let's not do this right here.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.929
Malcolm, I know what secrets do to people.
My dad and all his of lies...

18:17.012 --> 18:19.932
Your dad was in the CIA.
It was the job. This is mine.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.852
Eventually, you become the job.
You start disappearing.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.937
Hey...

18:25.938 --> 18:27.189
I'm still here.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.816
Are you?

18:32.736 --> 18:37.324
Look, Zaya, this woman is trying
to stop a killer, unlike Hogarth...

18:37.407 --> 18:39.910
And me. Unlike Hogarth and me.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.456
There is a reason that we have laws
and law enforcement,

18:44.540 --> 18:46.667
judges, juries, courts, lawyers...

18:46.750 --> 18:48.645
Which you of all people know
don't always work...

18:48.669 --> 18:50.087
...which are imperfect,

18:50.629 --> 18:53.257
but I trust them a hell of a lot more
than some chick in a mask.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.302
Of course, I don't know
the chick personally. You do.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.556
Yeah, I do.
And what she's doing is important.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.639
More important than us?

19:03.767 --> 19:07.437
It's not an either/or proposition.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.940
It is to me.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.625
Can you pull up a satellite view
of Hudson Street Market?

19:28.709 --> 19:29.710
Hello to you, too.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.254
Can you can the sass and just do the job?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.841
Those two guys
probably knew each other.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.551
Gotta be something in walking distance.

19:42.431 --> 19:46.226
Well, it turns out that vandalism
is both fun and effective.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.854
- It's him?
- "Him" who? What are we watching?

19:51.148 --> 19:54.526
<i>Breaking things
is for the stupid and the crude.</i>

19:55.194 --> 19:57.946
<i>But it's all you can do,
because you're a fraud.</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:00.282
That's just rude.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.203
<i>By seven o'clock tonight,
everyone will know it.</i>

20:04.953 --> 20:07.539
We're running out of time.
It's already past 1:00.

20:11.668 --> 20:12.836
I'm gonna record it.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.380
Mirror this with your laptop.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.427
<i>Breaking things
is for the stupid and the crude.</i>

20:20.510 --> 20:23.805
He's still in Manhattan.
Cobblestone streets.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.099
I don't see the two guys
from Hudson Market.

20:26.183 --> 20:30.062
<i>By seven o'clock tonight,
everyone will know it.</i>

20:31.772 --> 20:34.024
- Done.
- Pause it.

20:36.652 --> 20:41.573
The two guys aren't there.
But she is. She was in the first video.

20:41.657 --> 20:46.995
Black jacket, black hair.
He's changing his MO to a proxy for you.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.623
Glad I haven't
<i>Single White Female'd </i> you yet.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.124
We need to warn her.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.295
Shit. We need Dorothy.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.259
- Just a little zhuzh.
- No.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.928
You have to sell yourself,
and this is part of it.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.888
- What's the time?
- Three-fifteen.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.765
Suit yourself.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.600
I've narrowed the location

21:08.684 --> 21:11.478
from the second video
to a couple streets in Tribeca.

21:11.561 --> 21:16.733
My "hero charade will end where it began,"
which was nowhere near Tribeca.

21:16.817 --> 21:20.445
Well, there are no cobblestone streets
near your childhood home,

21:20.529 --> 21:21.989
the Jersey Turnpike

21:22.072 --> 21:24.366
or the old IGH building.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.160
They're ready for you.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.579
Okay, now, remember...

21:30.080 --> 21:32.934
just because she asks you a question
does not mean you have to answer it.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.960
Except it's an interview.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.923
You just make it sound
like you're answering it.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.548
Right, like,
"That's an interesting question."

21:39.631 --> 21:44.261
Exactly.
And then you set your own narrative.

21:44.344 --> 21:49.975
You want the audience to trust you,
believe you? Be camera friendly.

21:50.058 --> 21:52.894
The operative word here is "friendly."

21:53.478 --> 21:54.521
So I'm screwed?

21:54.604 --> 21:56.165
- No, not at all!
- No, just be yourself.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.669
- Camera's gonna love you.
- Just be the nicer version of that.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.530
I think she's gonna be fine.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.369
Can you say a few words
so we can get our sound levels?

22:09.453 --> 22:10.787
Um...

22:11.288 --> 22:14.750
I need a drink. Bourbon, neat.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.045
- I've heard that about you.
- Well, people talk too much.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.128
Hmm.

22:19.838 --> 22:24.092
You are my first literal
female-empowerment interview.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.095
Oh, that's, uh, great.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.259
I bet you get some of your strength...

22:29.306 --> 22:30.466
...from your adoptive mother.

22:30.515 --> 22:34.227
She negotiated the hell out of me.
Said the only way it's happening is live.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.481
- And we rarely do live.
- Well, she's a beast.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.588
Must be nice to have someone
fight for you like that.

22:40.984 --> 22:44.571
Can we just get started already?
There's a serial killer out there.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.323
Alleged.

22:47.574 --> 22:50.202
We're going live in five, four...

22:50.285 --> 22:52.412
Come on, Jess. Friendly.

22:54.206 --> 22:58.168
<i>I'm here with Jessica Jones,
a private investigator and superhero.</i>

22:58.251 --> 22:59.669
<i>I'm not a superhero.</i>

22:59.753 --> 23:02.393
<i>But you have squared off
against some superpowered people.</i>

23:02.422 --> 23:06.426
Kilgrave and that female serial murderer
last year.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.470
And now you're after
another alleged killer.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.514
But this one doesn't have superpowers.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.224
Bad is bad.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.851
<i>The police handle bad every day.</i>

23:14.935 --> 23:17.521
<i>- Why are you involved?
- Because I found him.</i>

23:18.105 --> 23:22.109
<i>Most people go their entire lives
without coming across people like this.</i>

23:22.192 --> 23:24.694
<i>And yet you've managed
to do it repeatedly.</i>

23:24.778 --> 23:26.363
Well, Thembi, like any good citizen,

23:26.446 --> 23:29.282
I am hoping to help the police
in their investigation.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.992
<i>Maybe because I give a shit.</i>

23:32.411 --> 23:34.287
We're live. Please watch your language.

23:34.371 --> 23:38.458
Look, I am here because there's
a serial killer out there hunting a woman.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.711
The same killer
who chopped up seven victims.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.879
And you know this how?

23:42.963 --> 23:46.758
Because it's what I do.
And this woman is in danger.

23:46.842 --> 23:50.053
If this is you, or you know who this is,
contact the NYPD...

23:50.137 --> 23:55.308
Do you have any idea why
this alleged serial killer contacted you?

23:55.392 --> 23:59.771
Because he's a creep and an asshole,
and his name is Gregory Sallinger.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.482
<i>To be clear,
we here at the station</i>

24:02.566 --> 24:06.278
<i>are not accusing Mr. Sallinger
of being a serial killer.</i>

24:07.112 --> 24:08.280
<i>I am.</i>

24:08.363 --> 24:13.618
He was cleared of all charges by the NYPD.
Didn't he accuse you of harassment?

24:13.702 --> 24:18.665
If harassment means calling him out
as the sick psycho that he is, yeah.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.750
Do you think this woman would be in danger

24:20.834 --> 24:24.546
if you hadn't provoked
whoever the actual killer may be?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.549
Are you asking if I'm responsible?

24:27.632 --> 24:29.384
Don't bite, Jess. Let it go.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.637
Is that why you teamed up
with this masked woman,

24:32.721 --> 24:34.473
who's wanted for questioning?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.932
Aren't you breaking the law

24:36.016 --> 24:39.644
by aiding and abetting
a violent, unhinged vigilante?

24:39.728 --> 24:40.729
I'm not unhinged.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.356
<i>Why don't you try pulling
your head out of your ass</i>

24:43.440 --> 24:45.108
and focusing on the truth for once?

24:45.692 --> 24:49.571
And remember, if you need help,
call Alias Investigations,

24:49.654 --> 24:53.658
<i>because everyone needs
a hero on their side.</i>

24:56.328 --> 24:57.996
Well, that went well.

24:58.079 --> 25:03.502
Are you kidding? They're gonna be playing
that clip all day long on every platform.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.004
If you wanted to get the word out,
you nailed it.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.300
I am so proud of you both.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.219
You know, it scares the crap out of me,

25:12.302 --> 25:16.681
but I can't deny
you are making this city safer.

25:18.725 --> 25:22.979
Of course, heroism won't pay the bills,
so we need to monetize it.

25:23.063 --> 25:27.359
I am thinking action figures,
video games... maybe a reality show.

25:27.442 --> 25:30.195
We only have a few hours
to live up to this hero shit.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.989
I will start drawing up
new costume ideas for you.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.616
Mom, stop.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.418
Costa.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.837
<i>What is it with you
and the shitstorms, Jones?</i>

25:47.921 --> 25:50.549
Every brunette in the city
is pouring into the station.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.468
My captain is pissed.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.471
<i>- He pulled my BOLO.</i>
- So, no one's looking for Sallinger?

25:56.555 --> 25:57.931
<i>We got a call earlier.</i>

25:58.014 --> 26:02.102
He was seen, uh, shouting
at his cell phone at a florist in Tribeca.

26:02.894 --> 26:03.895
Floratech.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.605
- Floratech?
- On it.

26:06.773 --> 26:09.442
<i>I'll be here processing
all the women you've terrified.</i>

26:09.526 --> 26:12.487
Well, maybe one of them
is actually Sallinger's victim.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.656
<i>We won't know till 7:00.</i>

26:16.199 --> 26:17.409
Be careful, Jones.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.149
- You seen this woman?
- No.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.633
Do you recognize this woman?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.927
- No, I haven't seen her before.
- Okay, thanks.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.180
- No. Move.
- Seen this... Okay, thanks. Dick.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.770
- What about that guy?
- No, sorry.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.441
- I got nothing.
- Me neither.

26:50.191 --> 26:53.153
We are running out of time. Shit.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.239
No. We can't let this asshole win.

26:56.323 --> 27:00.201
Excuse me, uh, can you
just take a look at this photo please?

27:00.285 --> 27:01.620
Have you seen this woman?

27:01.703 --> 27:03.663
- No, I haven't.
- I don't think so.

27:03.747 --> 27:04.789
Shit.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.375
- God damn it.
- Come on.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.713
- I hate giving a shit.
- I'm beginning to see why.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.637
GT Agrochemical.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.183
My family crashed
into their delivery truck.

27:24.392 --> 27:27.687
Which began your "hero charade."
Maybe that woman worked there.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.481
This has to be where he was leading us.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.091
Get out!

27:57.133 --> 27:59.844
- We don't keep any money here.
- We're not here to rob you.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.739
- Know who this is?
- What's going on?

28:01.763 --> 28:04.391
- Why are you wearing a mask?
- Do you know who this is?

28:04.474 --> 28:06.518
Ow! I'm not sure.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.728
Is that Mona Lee?

28:08.812 --> 28:11.940
- Take us to her now.
- All right. All right.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.661
- Which way?
- She's somewhere over there.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.162
Come on, let's go.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.422
- Where is she?
- You! Stop right there!

28:36.005 --> 28:38.049
Release Pavel and get on the ground now.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.843
Hold up!
We're just here to help.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.166
Security cameras say different.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.766
Get on the ground now.
We're taking you into custody.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.393
We don't have time for this.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.945
We're trying to goddamn help!

28:59.946 --> 29:00.947
Wait, it's her.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.367
Weren't you on TV today?

29:05.368 --> 29:07.871
- We're here for Mona Lee.
- The killer's after Mona?

29:07.954 --> 29:10.707
Let him go.

29:17.964 --> 29:18.965
We got this.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.878
- Please don't hurt me.
- We're here to protect you.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.945
- From whom?
- Is this you?

29:42.489 --> 29:45.533
Then there's a goddamn serial killer
after you and we're gonna save you,

29:45.617 --> 29:46.826
whether you like it or not.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.215
Hold on, sir.
Can you tell me where you've been?

30:00.965 --> 30:03.551
Are you here to arrest me
for going out for a cup of coffee?

30:04.469 --> 30:07.514
If so, I can call my lawyer,
then we can call a press conference,

30:07.597 --> 30:09.909
and we can show everyone
what police harassment looks like.

30:09.933 --> 30:10.933
Should we do that?

30:12.101 --> 30:13.102
No?

30:13.812 --> 30:17.065
Great. Then, I'm going to retire
to my apartment for the evening,

30:17.148 --> 30:20.485
and if either of you come near my door,
I'll have both your badges.

30:22.403 --> 30:23.404
Good night.

30:29.828 --> 30:30.912
Asshole.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.075
Sallinger's not here. He never was.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.744
Do you think he was messing with me?

31:52.827 --> 31:57.040
- Best scenario is yes.
- No, he's not done.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.000
Well, he's home now.
He got back an hour ago.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.044
What? Then arrest him.

32:01.127 --> 32:03.671
The only thing he's done
is sneak past my men.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.759
- He did something.
- Yeah. He dicked us around.

32:10.511 --> 32:15.433
Look, the, uh... the Wappinger Falls body
is finally back in our lab.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.478
Well, it better have some
goddamn biometric bullshit

32:18.561 --> 32:19.812
or other evidence on it.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.484
I worry about you, Jones.

32:26.736 --> 32:30.198
Do you have anything in your life
besides the job?

32:31.282 --> 32:32.700
Yeah, a great bartender.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.704
I think it takes more.
I'm trying for more.

32:38.456 --> 32:39.457
We'll see.

32:40.541 --> 32:43.419
Uh, I'll let you know as soon
as the arrest warrant comes in.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.797
Till then, keep your head down.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.258
Till the rest of my life.
This publicity shit blows.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.515
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.

32:55.598 --> 32:58.351
- Comment on accusations?
- Shit. Shit.

32:58.434 --> 33:01.229
Jessica, do you still stand by
your accusation of Mr. Sallinger

33:01.312 --> 33:03.523
despite no evidence
he even threatened Ms. Lee?

33:03.606 --> 33:05.900
- Yes.
- Obsessed with Sallinger?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.824
If wrong, how will you
make reparations with Mr. Sallinger?

33:10.780 --> 33:14.367
Are you afraid of any
possible lawsuits from Gregory Sallinger?

33:14.450 --> 33:15.743
You need to get out of my way.

33:15.827 --> 33:20.039
Ms. Jones, do you feel any responsibility
for terrifying the women of this city?

33:21.582 --> 33:24.502
Don't answer that. Let's go.

33:24.585 --> 33:25.712
No more questions.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.197
<i>Don't answer that. Let's go.</i>

33:31.259 --> 33:33.988
- <i>Hiding your identity?
- Official team now?</i>

33:34.012 --> 33:35.692
- <i>No more questions.</i>
- Jeri.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.349
I still haven't been able
to get a hold of Sallinger.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.978
- We need a statement.
- Obviously, he's laying low right now.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.062
Mmm.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.691
These vigilantes
are controlling the narrative.

33:49.902 --> 33:50.903
Yeah?

33:50.987 --> 33:53.072
<i>Sid Franken from the</i> Bulletin
<i>is on the phone.</i>

33:53.156 --> 33:55.116
<i>Wants a comment from Mr. Sallinger.</i>

33:56.492 --> 33:57.852
Tell him to get in line.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.204
Char... wait.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.374
I'll take it.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.672
Sid? Jeryn Hogarth here.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.802
Mr. Sallinger is unavailable.
But I can tell you this...

34:16.554 --> 34:19.348
Jessica Jones, a former client of mine,

34:20.058 --> 34:24.353
is associating with the masked woman
who assaulted my client.

34:26.063 --> 34:30.943
No one, powered or otherwise,
should be above the law.

34:31.027 --> 34:35.322
Hence, Hogarth & Associates
is making it our business to stop them.

34:37.824 --> 34:42.246
Sid, I'm not... I'm not gonna comment
on Peter Lyonne's suicide statement.

34:42.914 --> 34:47.543
This firm has never, nor will it ever...

34:48.335 --> 34:54.634
favor, harbor or support the illegal
activities of powered vigilantes.

34:55.885 --> 34:59.722
If Jessica Jones
knows who this woman is...

35:01.557 --> 35:04.602
let her be warned, I'm comin' for her.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.356
You can quote me on that.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.489
A war on superheroes?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.200
You bet your ass.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.336
You're an idiot, you know?

35:31.420 --> 35:32.421
Yeah.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.757
You could've been caught.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.135
Yeah.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.304
Thanks.

35:41.472 --> 35:43.641
Guess we're an official team now.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.893
With a publicist and everything.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.687
I'll let Mom down easy.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.148
She actually helped today.

35:51.941 --> 35:52.942
Don't tell her.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.161
What?

36:05.788 --> 36:08.332
Everything Sallinger does has a purpose.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.713
He wanted to make you look bad.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.215
Or he wanted to draw out
the masked vigilante.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.553
He still doesn't know who she is.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.682
But he knows who my sister is.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.562
Be careful.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.190
You, too.

36:48.831 --> 36:52.210
<i>Breaking things
is for the stupid and the crude.</i>

36:52.793 --> 36:56.130
<i>But it's all you can do,
because you're a fraud.</i>

36:58.549 --> 37:02.428
<i>By seven o'clock tonight,
everyone will know it.</i>

37:12.146 --> 37:13.147
Yeah?

37:18.986 --> 37:20.571
Saw you on the news.

37:21.280 --> 37:25.910
Yeah. I am out to prove that
there is such a thing as bad publicity.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.537
Well, at least you got Trish
by your side now.

37:31.165 --> 37:32.708
I've known for a while.

37:33.834 --> 37:37.004
And I was worried at first.
I mean, Trish with superpowers?

37:39.048 --> 37:41.676
But now that you guys
are a team...

37:42.677 --> 37:44.095
Now you're terrified?

37:44.679 --> 37:47.515
No. No, I think you'll keep
each other in check.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.642
It's good you're not doing it alone.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.103
- I've done it my whole life.
- So have I.

37:52.687 --> 37:57.066
Till recently, and I...
might be about to do it again.

37:57.149 --> 38:00.444
- I don't do romantic advice.
- I wouldn't take it from you, anyway.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.530
But that's not why I'm here.

38:05.408 --> 38:09.036
Hogarth has asked me to unmask Trish.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.583
Are you gonna do that?

38:15.835 --> 38:16.835
No.

38:18.337 --> 38:19.880
You saved that girl today.

38:24.385 --> 38:29.015
What? You don't think she was his target?
Then who?

38:32.768 --> 38:38.316
Sallinger said this thing about...
my "hero charade ending where it began."

38:38.899 --> 38:40.651
Well, I wouldn't call it a charade.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.071
I mean, you got your powers
in that accident.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.490
Which also killed my family.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.786
Trish is the only family I have left.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.421
Oh, God.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.630
What?

39:02.298 --> 39:03.299
Oh, no.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.760
- Jess, talk to me.
- Shit.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.370
Mom?

39:47.760 --> 39:48.803
Mom?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.222
Mom?

40:01.524 --> 40:03.609
Mom! Oh, God! Oh, God!

40:18.374 --> 40:21.377
Help! Help me!

40:21.460 --> 40:23.546
No! Get... Mom! No!

40:25.631 --> 40:28.175
I can't... I can't get this...

40:34.140 --> 40:37.143
No! Ah!

40:37.768 --> 40:39.854
<i>Hi, this is Dorothy Walker.</i>

40:39.937 --> 40:43.482
<i>- Please leave a message.</i>
- Oh! No, no, no! Mom!

40:43.566 --> 40:45.151
- I...
<i>- Dorothy?</i>

40:46.569 --> 40:48.612
<i>Dorothy, pick up the phone
if you're there.</i>

40:50.114 --> 40:52.825
- Jess. Jess.
<i>- Dorothy, I think you're in danger.</i>

40:52.908 --> 40:55.995
Jess! Jess!

40:56.078 --> 40:58.414
He killed her. She's dead.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.416
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- Trish...

41:00.499 --> 41:04.211
<i>- He killed her. He killed her!</i>
- I'm on my way.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.590
Call the cops.

41:08.215 --> 41:11.510
I'm leaving right now.
I'm gonna be right there.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.595
<i>Trish?</i>

41:14.221 --> 41:15.806
It doesn't matter.

41:16.724 --> 41:17.808
<i>He has to pay.</i>

41:17.892 --> 41:19.685
Yes, and he will. Okay?

41:19.768 --> 41:22.021
Just stay there.
Don't do anything. Please.

41:22.563 --> 41:25.441
Trish, are you there? Shit.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.026
There's been a murder.

41:31.947 --> 41:33.949
Are you all right?

41:40.623 --> 41:41.665
Watch out!

42:08.651 --> 42:09.944
Trish, stop!
