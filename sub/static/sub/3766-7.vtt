WEBVTT

00:08.609 --> 00:09.977
Say that again?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.880
-Sugar beet juice.
-Will de-ice my driveway?

00:12.913 --> 00:15.216
It's odorless, colorless,
completely harmless

00:15.249 --> 00:17.885
-to humans,
animals, and plants.
-Nice.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.721
But that big winter storm
is totally gonna miss us.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.857
It better. I'm totally
out of salt for my walkways.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.326
And beets.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.330
Well, I still think
you should prepare.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.832
There's definitely a storm
on the way.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.502
Maybe more than one.

00:34.535 --> 00:38.038
Really? Well, if you think so,
then it's definitely coming.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.508
This could be just what I need
to boost my profile.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.975
Profile?

00:42.009 --> 00:45.679
Mayorally speaking, I have
been unchallenged in crisis.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.481
This could be my moment
to show the world

00:47.515 --> 00:48.616
just what I'm made of.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.187
-Hey, everybody.
-Hey!

00:53.221 --> 00:54.622
-Hey, Sam.
-Hello!

00:54.655 --> 00:56.890
Two fried egg sandwiches
with cheese and bacon

00:56.924 --> 00:59.793
and half a dozen donuts,
it's almost up.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.130
Now that is a very
hearty breakfast.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.332
(CHUCKLES) Nick is at
the office with me today.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.499
Some school thing.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.436
And for you,
fruit and a plain bagel.

01:08.469 --> 01:12.206
-Now that's a very
boring breakfast.
-(CHUCKLES)

01:12.240 --> 01:13.907
I was thinking
I'd drop by tonight
after work.

01:15.843 --> 01:16.910
Can I get back to you?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.280
Sure.

01:21.615 --> 01:25.819
Well, I'm off to begin
emergency preparations
for the storm.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.222
-And to prepare
for your close-up.
-Pardon me?

01:28.256 --> 01:30.057
Well, after their big storm
last year,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.025
the Blairsville mayor
ended up on the news.

01:32.059 --> 01:35.363
I do not do what I do
to get on TV.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.965
I do it for Middleton.
For my people.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.506
Well, I'm off to go
see a man about...

01:45.539 --> 01:48.142
-A house?
-A project.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.843
I would wish you luck,
but I don't think you need it.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.846
Thank you. See you soon.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.216
(SIGHS)

01:58.085 --> 02:01.489
You know, you really should
take some precautions
for the storm.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.458
Oh, you have a sense
something's brewing?

02:04.492 --> 02:07.094
Changes in
the barometric pressure,
wind direction,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.330
humidity, all affect
our bodies,

02:09.363 --> 02:11.165
our nervous systems,
our endocrine systems,

02:11.199 --> 02:12.966
our cardiovascular systems.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.769
That's more than just a sense,
it's a warning.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.906
There is a 90% probability
that the storm's gonna
miss Middleton.

02:18.939 --> 02:22.210
That's a fact backed up by
the National Weather Service.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.612
Well,
"Luck favors the prepared."

02:24.645 --> 02:27.515
-Louis Pasteur.
-Father of microbiology.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.517
You do have an eclectic
reading list, don't you?

02:29.550 --> 02:30.818
I do.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.020
Yeah, he felt that something
he couldn't see

02:33.053 --> 02:34.722
was making people sick.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.458
He couldn't see the germs,
but he knew that
they were there.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.160
Are you saying
you're the Louis Pasteur
of weather?

02:40.194 --> 02:42.930
No, I'm saying
there's a storm on the way,
a big one.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.832
(CHUCKLES) Oh,
a storm I can handle.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.768
My ex-wife,
I'm not so sure.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.237
And unfortunately,
unlike the storm,

02:49.270 --> 02:53.407
there is a 100% chance
of Linda hitting town tonight

02:53.441 --> 02:55.543
and causing complete chaos.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.067
Kind of cool having you
shadow me today.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.201
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.836
I shadowed Dad
when I was your age.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.372
Mr. Riddle?

03:24.405 --> 03:26.807
So he hasn't changed
his assignment
since you were in school?

03:26.840 --> 03:29.209
I don't think he's changed
that assignment
since the beginning of time.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.344
(GIGGLES)

03:30.378 --> 03:32.212
An original essay
with pictures,

03:32.246 --> 03:34.114
a day in the life
of one of your parents.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.084
Well, thank you
for being a proxy parent.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.453
And I'm sure Cassie
would've loved to have you
at the shop today.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.057
I need to be with you today.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.627
Well, I hope I give you
enough to write about.

03:46.660 --> 03:50.498
Being a cop in Middleton
can be, uh, pretty uneventful.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.100
-I just don't want
to let you down.
-You won't.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.103
And hey, you never know
what'll happen, right?

03:56.136 --> 03:58.205
No, you don't.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.074
And uh, that's what I love
about this job.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.082
(DOOR CHIMES)

04:11.419 --> 04:14.087
-Eve.
-Hello, Cassie.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.789
How was antiquing
in Blairsville?

04:15.823 --> 04:18.359
It took us almost
three hours to get there.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.993
It was lovely, Cassie.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.263
Ah, sometimes the journey
is the destination.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.733
You've been such
a wonderful hostess.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.169
We love staying at Grey House,
it feels like home.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.539
-A home where I don't
have to clean the kitchen.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

04:31.572 --> 04:33.941
When's the last time
you cleaned the kitchen?

04:33.974 --> 04:35.543
Ah, when we were dating?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.446
Oh, and that time
your mother stopped by.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.280
-You mean Thanksgiving?
-Yeah.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.415
Then I rest my case.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.584
And what case is that?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.887
The case that says
I didn't marry you for your
kitchen cleaning ability.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.489
Oh, of course not.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.324
-That's why I married you.
-Mmm.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.061
So, um,
you heading home today?

04:54.094 --> 04:56.797
-Yeah.
-We were hoping
for a late checkout.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.399
Somebody needs a nap.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.369
And by somebody,
he means him.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.403
For your stomach.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.339
How did you know?

05:05.373 --> 05:07.541
-Your eyes.
-My eyes?

05:07.575 --> 05:10.611
They're not just windows
into your soul,
they're also sometimes

05:10.644 --> 05:11.712
windows into your stomach.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.081
They're a tinge red,

05:14.114 --> 05:15.883
which tells me
that something's going on.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.686
-Really?
-Truly.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.422
It's a powder made
from guyabano fruit.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.625
It'll help your stomach,
especially with
a long car ride ahead.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.260
We also have
an excellent doctor in town.
Dr. Sam Radford.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.030
He once cracked a rib skiing,

05:30.063 --> 05:32.900
he didn't go to see a doctor
until a week later.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.569
I'm hoping our baby
doesn't inherit
Brian's stubborn gene.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.872
(LAUGHS)

05:45.579 --> 05:47.415
DEREK:
What are you looking at?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.916
MARTHA: Clouds.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.618
According to the weather girl
on Channel 7,

05:50.651 --> 05:53.020
the storm that's heading
our way is very powerful,

05:53.053 --> 05:54.488
so we need to prepare.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.056
They hired her
'cause she's cute.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.158
I don't even think
she's a meteorologist.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.460
In fact, six months ago,

05:59.493 --> 06:02.162
I swear she sold me
a pair of shoes
at that store on Main.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.832
And why are you wearing that?

06:05.999 --> 06:07.468
Oh!

06:07.501 --> 06:10.170
He, or in this case she,
who wears the orange vest,

06:10.203 --> 06:13.040
is the one to follow
in an emergency situation.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.909
I want to make sure that
we have everything ready.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.645
-Oh!
-Ooh!

06:17.678 --> 06:19.480
You remember that big
storm last year?

06:19.513 --> 06:22.115
-That hit Blairsville?
-Yes, well, Blairsville
has all the luck.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.351
What is it that
you want me to do?

06:26.186 --> 06:28.589
I think we need to send out
an email alert

06:28.622 --> 06:31.659
to all the citizens outlining
emergency procedures.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.261
Okay. Shoot!

06:34.294 --> 06:35.395
Me shoot?

06:36.664 --> 06:37.931
Well, it's your memo.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.667
Right. Oh, right.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.636
Um...

06:45.138 --> 06:48.175
The mark of a good leader
is the ability to delegate.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.544
So I task you
with finishing the memo.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.213
Who? You?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.882
Me... Me?

06:59.119 --> 07:00.253
Hi, Sam.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.856
Abigail.
So how's the new job going?

07:02.890 --> 07:04.525
I go where I'm needed.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.694
-So Stephanie needs you?
-Yeah.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.463
Okay, I'm gonna have, uh...

07:09.497 --> 07:12.099
Two mushroom burgers
with all the fixings
and a shake.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.202
Neat trick.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.471
If you're looking
for Stephanie,
she's not here.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.573
-Oh.
-But I can leave a message
if you want.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.274
About your wife
coming to town?

07:22.476 --> 07:24.778
Ex. And how did you...
Oh, Cassie.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.548
Yeah, sure, Cassie.

07:27.581 --> 07:31.084
-Oh, and Nick wants, uh...
-Fries. Chili cheese.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.920
They're in the bag.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.330
Wow.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.799
This is gonna be huge
for Blairsville.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.901
Huge for you, too.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.937
A mall provides jobs.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.404
That means more people.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.774
And those people need houses.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.043
Where exactly do I fit in?
I mean, now. I mean,

07:56.076 --> 07:59.246
it's gonna be a little while
before those people
who need houses get here.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.314
In order to secure
the financing from my bank,

08:01.348 --> 08:04.284
I have to show to them
that the mall
will have tenants.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.620
Oh, so, that's where
I come in, tenants.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.889
I need 20 letters of intent
from businesses

08:08.922 --> 08:11.825
to prove to the bank
that these leases
will get signed.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.493
Twenty?

08:13.527 --> 08:17.097
My main office is in Chicago
and my local guy here
just fell out.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.099
Even though Blairsville's
only a couple of hours
from Middleton,

08:19.132 --> 08:21.869
you'll find yourself
on the road, a lot.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.104
Why me?

08:24.137 --> 08:27.007
I've been doing
a lot of thinking since
the Keating house deal.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.041
I like your honesty.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.743
Oh, thanks.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.445
When I find somebody
I can trust,

08:32.479 --> 08:34.381
my gut tells me
I have to be in business
with them.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.652
So, if you want in...

08:39.587 --> 08:40.588
I want in.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.290
Then get me those letters.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.625
Will do.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.995
SAM: Just let me
drop off these labs.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.898
You want to stop for dinner
on the way home? My treat.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.433
(CHUCKLES) You're my father,
you kind of have to treat.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.637
(LAUGHS)
Still, guys' night out.

08:56.670 --> 09:00.240
Should we get something
for Mom? She gets in late.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.610
That's a good idea.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.278
-Why are you looking
at me like that?
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

09:05.312 --> 09:07.480
I just know you're excited
about seeing your mom.

09:07.514 --> 09:11.118
Yeah, but she's only here
for a couple of nights...

09:12.419 --> 09:13.854
SAM: Thanks.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.425
Okay, should we go
to the Bistro or the Bistro?

09:18.458 --> 09:21.061
No. Let's just go home.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.497
(SIGHS)

09:35.909 --> 09:37.110
Grace?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.747
Yeah?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.782
You're not getting
out of the car.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.451
(LAUGHS)

09:44.818 --> 09:46.086
Oh.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.856
What's up with you today?

09:48.889 --> 09:51.358
Wanting to be with me,
not wanting to be with Cassie.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.995
Can't it just be
that I want to spend
time with you?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.530
It can, but it's not.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.801
I need to come
with you tomorrow.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.337
-Need?
-Want.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.405
Look, I would love that,

10:05.438 --> 10:07.207
but I think you
have enough material.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.742
(SIGHS)

10:08.776 --> 10:10.077
Hey, how about
I swing by in the morning

10:10.110 --> 10:11.144
and pick you up, okay?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.412
I can bring you
to the library,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.748
you can work on your paper
and I'll see if have time

10:14.782 --> 10:16.950
for us to do
a late lunch tomorrow.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.219
Where, maybe you will
tell me what you're up to?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.023
Okay.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.396
-Night.
-Good night.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.640
(SIGHS)

10:40.674 --> 10:44.044
-It's getting cold out there.
-Smells like snow.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.479
-I've got soup.
-Perfect.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.116
How's the school
project going?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.584
Well,

10:51.618 --> 10:54.755
Brandon let me blast
the siren and showed me
how to use a radar gun.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.289
Hmm, sounds like an
interesting beginning.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.192
Yeah.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.397
-Where's Eve and Brian?
-They just left.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.666
You know, I really like them.

11:06.700 --> 11:07.735
I hope they come back.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.870
They will.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.844
Thanks.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.080
Smells good.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.949
Looks like you have
some trouble of your own.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.417
You okay?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.753
Yeah.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.624
But, you don't believe me,
do you?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.327
Well, I just know you.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.567
I'm gonna get us some water.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.826
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

12:07.660 --> 12:09.696
-Hey.
-(SIGHS)

12:10.163 --> 12:11.231
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:13.066 --> 12:14.267
You want to talk about it?

12:14.301 --> 12:15.435
About what?

12:15.468 --> 12:17.537
Whatever it is you came over
to talk about.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.841
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what's wrong,
stop badgering me.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.976
I do, I want to talk.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.879
-And you hate that.
-I'm not big on sharing.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.883
Just ask
my ex-wife's therapist.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.086
Oh, um,
Linda's not coming to town.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.388
Oh, come on,
how do you do that?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.325
You always know something
that you have
no way of knowing.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.427
-And you're calling her Linda?
-She asked me to.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.395
-When?
-When she canceled.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.331
-Canceled what?
-Her reservation.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.900
-She made a reservation here?
-I run a bed and breakfast.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.535
My ex wouldn't stay
at a place like this.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.471
-No offense.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.772
She was looking forward to it.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.341
Was she? You two chatted?

12:54.374 --> 12:57.510
We did. She has a really
good sense of humor.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.848
-No, she doesn't.
-No, she doesn't.
(LAUGHS)

13:00.881 --> 13:02.449
-Does she?
-(LAUGHS)

13:02.482 --> 13:04.284
Wait, so you didn't
talk to her?

13:04.317 --> 13:07.654
You know, just for a moment
when she called to
cancel the reservation

13:07.687 --> 13:08.989
and long enough
for me to notice

13:09.022 --> 13:10.323
that she does not have
a good sense of humor.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.859
(SIGHS)

13:11.892 --> 13:13.526
But I had you there
for a minute, didn't I?
(LAUGHS)

13:15.428 --> 13:17.130
And Nick's gonna think
it's because of me

13:17.164 --> 13:19.466
when it's really because
his mother values her business

13:19.499 --> 13:21.835
more than spending time
with her son.

13:21.869 --> 13:25.205
And again, I am left
to tell Nick something
he doesn't want to hear,

13:25.238 --> 13:26.673
which makes me the bad guy.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.842
Again.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.513
But she really made
a reservation?

13:33.546 --> 13:36.549
She did, I had a lovely room
ready for her.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.784
I still do.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.619
Hmm.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.687
(HORN HONKING)

13:43.090 --> 13:45.192
-Linda?
-No. It's not her.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.934
We were a ways out of town.
I thought we should turn back.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.936
-I think something's wrong.
-Eve?

13:57.704 --> 13:58.738
I'm scared.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.682
Should we get to a hospital?
Is the baby coming?

14:09.716 --> 14:12.986
Oh, oh, not quite yet.
It's just some cramping.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.088
Can't be Braxton Hicks,
too early?

14:15.122 --> 14:17.590
-Correct.
-I don't understand.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.793
Uh, Braxton Hicks are just
sort of practice contractions.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.463
It's just the body's way of
getting ready to give birth.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.498
But if they'd been
real contractions?

14:25.532 --> 14:28.101
Well, that would be
a lot more serious at this
point in the pregnancy.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.269
And if that were the case,

14:29.302 --> 14:30.703
we'd have to get Eve
to the hospital right away.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.439
But it's not.

14:32.472 --> 14:36.209
She looks good,
and the baby's got a
strong, steady heartbeat.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.812
Cramping's really common
and it's nothing
to worry about.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.848
He's been worried for months.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.216
I'm a worrier.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.985
That's why he has
such a bad stomach.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.320
BRIAN: (LAUGHS) It's true.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.322
I guess I need
to learn to relax.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.492
-You do.
-Agreed.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.528
Doctor's orders, in fact.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.131
I don't know
that being on the road
is such a good idea.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.467
Yeah. I think you two
should check back
into Grey House.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.669
Give me a chance to get
Eve in the office tomorrow,

15:03.170 --> 15:04.437
run some tests.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.805
Well, if you think
that's best.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.008
SAM: I do.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.409
And if you need
anything at all,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.178
remember I'm just
right next door.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.346
-Literally.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:13.380 --> 15:14.547
Excuse me.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.249
(SIGHS)

15:18.918 --> 15:21.188
I've seen a lot of nervous
expectant fathers,

15:21.221 --> 15:24.124
but our friend Brian
must be in the top five.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.161
-What?
-Well, I wonder

15:28.195 --> 15:30.863
if we shouldn't get them
to a hospital just to be safe?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.701
I have learned
to respect your intuition,

15:34.734 --> 15:37.070
but when it comes to this,
I have to act on fact,

15:37.104 --> 15:39.439
tangible facts.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.907
No, there is nothing going on

15:40.940 --> 15:42.642
with Eve that warrants
a trip to the ER

15:42.675 --> 15:43.943
or a hospital stay.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.114
I think you're off this time.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.881
Happens to the best of us.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.387
(SIGHING) I'll check back in
tomorrow morning.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.559
-Good night.
-Good night.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.608
You're still awake.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.479
Doing homework?

16:19.512 --> 16:21.581
Mom's stuck in New York,

16:21.614 --> 16:23.283
she's not coming.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.452
She texted.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.420
Yeah, I was going to
tell you in the morning.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.655
(SCOFFS)

16:28.688 --> 16:30.323
Don't sweat it, Dad.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.092
It's Mom.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.593
I didn't really think
she was gonna come.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.129
She could fly in tomorrow.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.297
She only had a day and a half

16:37.330 --> 16:39.166
before she had to
be in Hong Kong.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.367
She's not coming.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.303
What do you say you and I
do something tomorrow?

16:43.336 --> 16:46.005
Anything you want. Name it.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.108
I want to move back
to New York.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.193
-Whoo! Morning.
-Hey.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.295
Brought your paper.
Man, it's cold out there.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.298
What?
Didn't you hear the latest?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.433
The weather people say
that the winter storm

17:13.466 --> 17:15.335
will definitely
miss Middleton.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.470
My ex, on the other hand,
has already made a direct hit.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.240
Nick's really upset.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.242
And since he can't take it out
on her...

17:22.275 --> 17:23.310
He takes it out on you.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.246
We always hurt
the ones we love.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.580
He must really love me.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.083
He does.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.818
So is he going to the office
with you today?

17:32.952 --> 17:34.421
He's at the library
working on his paper.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.289
-Really?
-(LAUGHING)

17:36.323 --> 17:37.857
Yeah, it threw me, too.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.727
Naturally, I assumed
he was pulling a fast one.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.095
But he convinced me that,

17:42.129 --> 17:44.697
given the choice between
disinfecting exam rooms

17:44.731 --> 17:46.899
and sitting in
a comfortable library,

17:46.933 --> 17:48.735
he'd choose the latter.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.938
So, how's my patient?

17:51.971 --> 17:54.774
Oh, she, uh,
she had trouble sleeping
last night so I gave her

17:54.807 --> 17:58.077
some warm milk with cherries
and fermented chamomile.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.114
Always worked for me.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.850
Fermentation allows
for quicker absorption.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.718
-You don't say.
-I do say.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.754
-But you don't believe.
-(CHUCKLES)

18:07.787 --> 18:10.723
I'm gonna get Eve
into the office
and I'll run some blood,

18:10.757 --> 18:12.492
do a full physical,
if there's something
wrong with her,

18:12.525 --> 18:14.494
I'll find it and treat it.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.729
Scout's honor.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.798
I was, by the way.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.600
Eagle Scout.
(SNIFFS)

18:21.100 --> 18:22.302
(LAUGHS)

18:31.444 --> 18:32.645
Hi.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.415
Hi.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.451
I missed you at school.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.421
My Dad got a new job
and a new apartment
in Davenport.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.956
Oh!

18:43.990 --> 18:45.825
Yeah, I was staying with him.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.498
Are you moving away?

18:51.531 --> 18:54.967
Um, my parents are just trying
to figure out custody.

18:55.001 --> 18:57.437
They both want me full time.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.072
Well, if you live
with your dad,
then when will I see you?

19:00.106 --> 19:01.808
Even when I'm here,
you seem to be
doing other stuff

19:01.841 --> 19:03.210
with other people, so...

19:03.243 --> 19:06.546
Anthony, look, I know
that you're still upset
about that whole...

19:06.579 --> 19:08.381
Lying to me,

19:08.415 --> 19:09.749
using me as cover
with your family

19:09.782 --> 19:10.983
while you go hang out
with Nick.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.485
I wasn't hanging with Nick.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.187
Hey, look, it's simple,

19:14.221 --> 19:17.557
you want to be friends
with Nick, you don't want
to be friends with me.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.528
(EXHALES)

19:25.565 --> 19:30.203
All I'm saying is
it couldn't hurt to jazz up
the menu a little bit.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.704
Some nouvelle cuisine?

19:31.738 --> 19:33.373
Well, the soup
is "nouvelle" every day.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.209
-What?
-(SIGHS)

19:36.243 --> 19:38.144
Well, if you don't like
my ideas about the menu,

19:38.177 --> 19:40.813
you're gonna hate my plans
to feng shui the restaurant.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.683
(EXHALES)

19:51.491 --> 19:52.892
Last week
she's working for Sam,

19:52.925 --> 19:54.327
this week she's working
for Stephanie?

19:55.228 --> 19:56.363
And I thought Stephanie

19:56.396 --> 19:58.064
wasn't exactly crazy
for Abigail

19:58.097 --> 20:00.433
because Abigail
was a bit crazy for Sam.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.270
Well, if she's working
for her...

20:03.303 --> 20:04.871
Then she can't work for Sam.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.073
Makes sense.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.410
Yeah, I think Abigail
feels like she's needed
here in Middleton.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.444
What do you feel?

20:12.812 --> 20:15.315
In her own unique way,
she means well.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.149
-She's trouble.
-She's family.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.286
Yes, but sometimes,
family can be trouble.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.923
-Ryan.
-Yes?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.825
Just tell me the thing
you don't want to tell me.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.830
The developer
from Keating House
wants to build a mall

20:31.264 --> 20:33.065
in Blairsville

20:33.099 --> 20:35.101
and he wants me
to be a part of it.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.135
What do you think?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.071
Well, I'm not
a big fan of malls.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.474
I know. But can you imagine
the kind of business

20:41.508 --> 20:44.210
that another
Bell, Book & Candle could do
in a location like that?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.212
You can't franchise what I do.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.047
You don't you want to share
that with other people?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.750
Yeah, well, what makes
Bell, Book & Candle special is

20:50.783 --> 20:53.152
I get to personally deal
with everyone who comes in.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.521
I get to know them.
I...

20:54.554 --> 20:57.690
I find out about
their problems,
and their needs...

20:57.724 --> 20:59.592
Middleton's my little
corner of the world,

20:59.626 --> 21:01.794
I like it like that.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.230
Bigger isn't always better,
it's just bigger.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.203
If I get this project,

21:11.237 --> 21:14.073
it's going to mean
spending a lot more time
away from Middleton.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.211
Well, I always think
what's important is not
where we spend our time

21:19.245 --> 21:22.148
but how we intend
on spending it.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.717
I think I've been pretty clear
on how and with whom

21:24.751 --> 21:26.185
I would like to spend my time.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.657
(CHUCKLES)

21:30.690 --> 21:32.425
So, um,

21:32.459 --> 21:34.661
have you broken
the news yet to
Martha that you

21:34.694 --> 21:36.863
are planning on helping
build a mall in Blairsville?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.698
Do I have to?

21:38.731 --> 21:40.066
We often ask a question
we already know

21:40.099 --> 21:42.702
the answer to when
we don't like the answer.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.339
-Do I have to?
-(LAUGHS)

21:46.373 --> 21:48.641
Blairsville is getting a mall?

21:48.675 --> 21:50.076
Are you kidding me?

21:50.643 --> 21:52.812
-Martha.
-Sorry.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.514
How could you do that
to our town?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.549
How could you do that to me?
Oh!

21:56.583 --> 21:59.085
Et tu, Brutus, et tu?

21:59.118 --> 22:00.953
-It's Brute.
-Whatever. It's you.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.723
I didn't go looking
for it, Martha,
it just sort of happened.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.993
Well, I am not pleased
with you, Ryan Elliott,
not one bit.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.195
First, you give
the development project
to Blairsville,

22:09.228 --> 22:10.863
and now a mall, too?

22:10.897 --> 22:12.765
Well, the mall
hasn't happened yet.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.000
There's still a lot of work
to be done.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.202
Well, then I'll just have
to root for you to fail.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.837
I know.

22:17.870 --> 22:21.140
Speaking of things
that haven't happened yet,
this is army surplus.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.843
And it's expired!
You don't need this, Martha.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.178
There will be a storm!

22:27.447 --> 22:29.482
Oh, Blairsville can
have their little mall,

22:29.516 --> 22:32.118
but this storm belongs
to Middleton and to me.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.286
Okay.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.922
Well, I guess I'm just
going to have to hope

22:35.955 --> 22:37.890
for a major snow storm to hit
and cripple the town.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.492
Well, you better.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.761
(MEGAPHONE SIREN SOUNDS)

22:43.796 --> 22:44.997
(SIREN STOPS)

22:45.031 --> 22:46.566
Thank you.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.444
-Hello there, neighbor.
-Hey, how's Eve?

22:57.477 --> 22:59.612
Ah! You tell me.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.313
Well, I just got off
the phone with the lab,

23:01.347 --> 23:02.649
and the blood work looks good.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.317
But I suggested they
stay one more night,
head out in the morning.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.056
She's okay.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.058
(SIGHS) Yeah, just
because we don't see it,

23:12.091 --> 23:13.960
doesn't mean it's not there.

23:13.993 --> 23:17.997
And sometimes
we don't see it
because it's not there.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.466
You really think
there's something
I can't see?

23:19.499 --> 23:20.767
Something a test can't detect?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.234
That an exam can't uncover?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.671
-Yes.
-What?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.273
Something's off.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.208
(SIGHS)

23:34.914 --> 23:35.915
Hello.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.450
Hi!

23:39.085 --> 23:40.887
I thought it was only Cassie
that did that trick.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.155
Where are you off to?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.858
Bistro for coffee, then work.

23:46.759 --> 23:47.860
New work, right?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.663
Yeah.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.298
Sounds like
a real opportunity.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.801
It is.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.937
Did Cassie tell you?

23:57.970 --> 24:00.072
I'm pretty good
at figuring things
out on my own.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.174
I bet you are.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.821
ABIGAIL: Shall we?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.725
So tell me about your job...

24:21.894 --> 24:23.963
I give up. What is it?

24:23.996 --> 24:26.365
My anniversary present.

24:26.398 --> 24:29.068
-You're getting a...
-An AMRAP.

24:29.101 --> 24:32.138
-(LAUGHS)
-A Mine Resistant
Ambush Protected Vehicle.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.272
They can get through anything,

24:33.305 --> 24:36.242
downed trees,
floods, snow, ice.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.810
Don't they use those
in the military?

24:37.844 --> 24:40.947
Which means Middleton
can get a used one
at a very good price.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.517
Well, that's a very large
and expensive present
from your husband.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.486
I'm a lucky woman.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.689
And you think
we need one of these?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.223
Well, Blairsville
has a police boat.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.159
But they're on a river.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.395
Martha, I just don't think
our town needs a, a tank.

24:56.428 --> 24:58.531
Oh! It's not a tank!

24:59.999 --> 25:01.868
Look, it's got doors.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.338
I think it's less about
the power of the vehicle

25:06.372 --> 25:09.375
and more about the power
of the person driving
the vehicle, don't you?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.544
Well, yes...

25:12.278 --> 25:13.546
Oh.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.381
Oh.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.751
I'll be right with you.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.522
(CHUCKLES)

25:24.090 --> 25:26.025
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.527
How's your paper coming?

25:28.895 --> 25:29.996
Done.

25:31.397 --> 25:32.431
What's it about?

25:33.132 --> 25:35.635
You ask a lot of questions.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.136
It's called a conversation.
(LAUGHS)

25:37.904 --> 25:38.938
One way.

25:41.774 --> 25:42.975
And why is that?

(SIGHS)

25:57.189 --> 25:58.891
(DOOR CHIMES)

26:03.195 --> 26:04.330
What are we looking at?

26:05.031 --> 26:06.098
The storm.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.400
It's clear.

26:08.434 --> 26:09.902
CASSIE: Yeah, not for long.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.438
There's a big shift.
I can feel it.

26:12.471 --> 26:16.943
Yeah. So, uh,
speaking of shifts,
um, or "shifty"...

26:18.077 --> 26:19.211
Abigail.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.279
Something wrong at the store?

26:20.980 --> 26:22.248
No.

26:22.815 --> 26:23.816
So, what is it?

26:24.383 --> 26:26.418
Ryan.

26:26.452 --> 26:29.822
I think she's doing
the same thing she did to me
last week with Sam,

26:29.856 --> 26:30.857
to Ryan.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.661
Working her...magic.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.397
But you asked her
to work for you, right?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.900
Well, I couldn't keep
letting her work
with Sam, now, could I?

26:42.101 --> 26:45.271
(SIGHS) She's driving
me crazy, by the way.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.573
She keeps trying to change
everything at the Bistro,

26:47.606 --> 26:50.109
the menu, the food,
the room...

26:50.142 --> 26:51.577
Just everything.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.012
Well, if it isn't
the right fit...

26:53.045 --> 26:56.282
You know,
she keeps saying she's only
at the Bistro for me.

26:57.650 --> 27:00.086
I'm sure she has her reasons.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.054
That's what worries me.

27:02.554 --> 27:03.555
(SIGHS)

27:05.825 --> 27:07.159
(DOOR CHIMES)

27:09.495 --> 27:10.963
I've heard from three
small businesses

27:10.997 --> 27:12.765
that want to discuss
letters of intent.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.033
Oh, that's great.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.335
Now I just need to know
what your intentions are.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.071
Hmm?

27:19.105 --> 27:22.474
The next step would
have you spending a fair
amount of time in Blairsville.

27:22.508 --> 27:23.876
Would that be a problem?

27:23.910 --> 27:26.713
No, not a problem.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.248
But your home is here.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.484
And my job, I hope,
is with you and this project.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.021
Good to hear.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.459
-Thanks.
-See you tonight.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.828
Take care.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.140
I wanted to talk to you.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.375
-I wanted to talk to you.
-Yeah?

27:56.408 --> 27:58.144
Yeah, this isn't
working out for me.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.211
Excuse me?

28:00.646 --> 28:02.014
I quit.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.350
-Excuse me?
-I quit.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.619
-But I was going to...
-You were gonna fire me?

28:08.287 --> 28:10.823
Yes. No. I mean...

28:10.857 --> 28:13.425
-(SCOFFS) You just started.
-So what?

28:13.459 --> 28:15.561
-You were gonna fire me.
-Still...

28:16.729 --> 28:18.464
Today will be my last day.

28:24.737 --> 28:25.872
(SIGHS)

28:35.414 --> 28:37.283
-Hey, there.
-Hi.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.285
How's Eve?

28:39.318 --> 28:41.420
-Oh, she's resting.
-Hmm.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.290
Pregnancy is lovely
in so many ways,

28:44.323 --> 28:47.994
but one of the best things
is that it forces you
to take care of yourself.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.596
Because another life
is literally dependent on you.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.698
(CHUCKLES)

28:53.933 --> 28:55.301
You nervous about her?

28:56.102 --> 28:57.236
No.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.107
Well, you seem like a natural.
You're gonna do great.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.610
-Being a father.
-Hmm.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.445
But, you doubt yourself.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.182
Yeah.

29:10.216 --> 29:14.020
Well, I just didn't have
a great role model growing up.

29:14.053 --> 29:17.456
My dad wasn't around much
when I was young

29:17.489 --> 29:18.858
and he took off
when I was in high school.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.793
So...

29:20.827 --> 29:25.564
And it was a surprise
when Eve found out
she was pregnant, so...

29:25.597 --> 29:29.368
Not a lot of time to adjust
and figure things out.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.270
Well, parenting is really
just about taking care

29:31.303 --> 29:33.639
of someone
other than yourself.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.641
The first rule of taking
care of others,

29:35.674 --> 29:37.776
is taking care of yourself.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.778
My stomach.

29:40.847 --> 29:41.848
It's a good start.

29:43.682 --> 29:44.884
Have you seen a doctor?

29:44.917 --> 29:47.786
No, no, I haven't had time.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.121
I own my own business.

29:49.155 --> 29:52.024
Ah, so you're really
a father already, then.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.260
(LAUGHING) Yeah,
I guess I am.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.396
Well,

29:57.429 --> 29:59.531
just a few drops,
it's mostly ginger.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.267
It works for me.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.070
Thanks.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.072
Just remember,
I'm not the only one in town

30:06.105 --> 30:07.673
who might be able to help you.

30:07.706 --> 30:09.475
Dr. Radford
is right next door.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.344
Yeah, thanks, Cassie,
but no thanks.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.028

30:29.061 --> 30:31.597
Not a problem.
Yeah, thank you.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.199
All right, it's official.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.134
We're gonna get hit
with the storm after all.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.802
-Middleton? Really?
-Yeah.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.171
-We never get hit.
-Well, it changed course.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.306
It's headed straight for us.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.409
Just like Cassie thought.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.212
-Snow?
-Yeah, snow.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.947
Snow, ice, sleet.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.282
This is a trifecta
of bad news, all right?

30:50.316 --> 30:53.052
Why don't you start
getting the road closure
signs together

30:53.085 --> 30:56.455
and I'm gonna send out
an emergency email blast.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.524
You do realize this town
isn't properly prepared

30:58.557 --> 31:00.226
for any sort
of disaster, right?

31:00.259 --> 31:03.795
I am well aware of that,
Brandon, all right?
But we are going to need help.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.764
Look on the bright side,

31:05.797 --> 31:07.433
the mayor's gonna get
the storm she wanted.

Oh!

Yes, thank you, Chief Sanders.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.316

of my safety plan.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.451

31:26.986 --> 31:28.287
Yes!

31:28.320 --> 31:30.389
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
We're getting
a great big, big storm!

31:31.590 --> 31:33.259
Oh! Yes, Chief?

31:33.292 --> 31:34.860
We don't have a safety plan.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.129
We certainly do,
I wrote it myself.

31:37.163 --> 31:40.199
Yeah, the first thing
on your list is to
call the President

31:40.232 --> 31:43.269
and then bring in
the National Guard
to enact a curfew.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.837
This is not about
safety plans anymore.

31:45.871 --> 31:48.640
This is not about
orange emergency vests.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.908
What is this about?

31:49.942 --> 31:52.278
You being wrong
and me being right.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.046
(SIGHS) All right, okay.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.615
Just go ahead, say it,
get it over with.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.918
I told you so. I told you so!

32:00.619 --> 32:03.055
-Yes, you did.
-Whew.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.790
All right, now
that that's all settled

32:04.823 --> 32:07.226
do you mind
if I go take care of the town?

32:07.259 --> 32:08.694
Oh, well, yes, of course.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.596
Meanwhile, I'm gonna
write my speech.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.499
I think I should give it
from atop a snowplow.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.934
That's very Patton-esque.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.437
Thank you!

32:22.308 --> 32:24.543

it never bites.

MAN: (ON RADIO)
Brandon, you need to start
closing roads. Over.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.072
Copy that.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.373
MAN: (ON RADIO)
Looks like our snow storm

32:54.406 --> 32:57.676
has turned into
an ice storm, a big one.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.445
It's already started
to freeze over.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.579
Copy that.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.681
Um, Grace.
She's at the library.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.116
Right. With Nick.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.851
I'll pick them up
after I block the roads.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.953
If I can't get them back here,
I'll bring them to the station

33:07.986 --> 33:09.888
until the roads are clear.
Can you tell Sam?

33:09.921 --> 33:12.124
-Yeah, I will.
-Can I get a ride
back into town?

33:12.158 --> 33:13.192
You just got here.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.461
I left something
at the Bistro.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.795
Is it that important?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.465
Yes. Yes, it is.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.600
All right, but it might
be a while before
I can get back to you.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.603
-No problem.
-Stay inside.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.506
-And tell your guests, too.
-Yeah. Be careful.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.513

(SCREAMS)

34:15.954 --> 34:17.189
(WHIMPERS)

34:24.363 --> 34:26.332
So Jones made me
an offer today.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.999
What kind of an offer?

34:28.033 --> 34:30.536
The kind of offer that may be
hard to turn down.

34:32.604 --> 34:33.672
(EXHALES)

34:33.705 --> 34:35.174
-Hey!
-Hey.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.309
-Hey!
-Am I interrupting?

34:37.343 --> 34:39.578
No! No, come on in.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.014
Ah, thanks for
the message about Nick.

34:43.048 --> 34:44.283
Oh, yeah.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.685
I should go.

34:46.718 --> 34:49.188
-It's getting really
bad out there, and...
-Um, you should stay.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.956
All the bad weather
is south of Blairsville

34:50.989 --> 34:53.759
and I got to meet Jones,
so I got a hotel room.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.228
I'm gonna drive home
tomorrow morning
when the roads are clear.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.131
And you look worried.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.133
Of course I'm worried.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.469
I like that.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.104
A lot.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.441
-See you, Doc.
-See ya.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.844
(SIGHS)

35:14.980 --> 35:16.014
I did interrupt.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.850
What can I do for you?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.051
How's Eve today?

35:20.752 --> 35:22.221
She seems to be doing well.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.523
-But...
-Uh...

35:24.556 --> 35:26.325
Did Brian come to see you?

35:26.358 --> 35:28.394
-About Eve?
-No, about him.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.296
I don't have a lot
to cure what ails him.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.464
Nervous father-to-be
is kind of like a fever.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.633
-You just have
to let it run its course.
-Hmm.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.835
But you don't think so.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.907
What I think is that...
It's time for dinner.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.543
An early dinner. Join me?

35:44.576 --> 35:47.145
-Cao lau. My own recipe.
-Ugh.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.080
It's a classic
Vietnamese dish.

35:49.114 --> 35:50.582
(INHALES) Ah...

35:50.616 --> 35:51.883
Pork and noodles.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.920
Real pork or some vegan
pork-like substitute?

35:54.953 --> 35:56.188
Real pork.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.524
I should have just
said yes, shouldn't I?

35:58.557 --> 36:00.192
Yeah. You should've said yes.
Are you saying yes?

36:00.226 --> 36:02.928
Yes. Bring on the Cao lau!

36:02.961 --> 36:04.396
(LAUGHING)

36:14.873 --> 36:17.008
(SIGHS) There's a problem
with my sitter.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.144
I don't wanna leave you
but I have to get my daughter.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.079
Just stay here
and I will be right back.

36:21.112 --> 36:24.283
Uh, it's okay, my brother
is going to come get us.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.584
-Brandon?
-Yes.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.219
All of you?

36:27.853 --> 36:29.555
Yes.

36:29.588 --> 36:30.989
All right. I'm still gonna
come back though,

36:31.022 --> 36:33.392
-make sure
you get out all right.
-Thank you.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.264
Now what?

36:39.531 --> 36:40.532
(SIGHS)

36:41.099 --> 36:42.368
I don't know.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.969
I wasn't talking to you.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.203
I was talking to Grace.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.706
I don't know, Anthony.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.244
I guess we just wait
for Brandon.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.613
Looks like I have a new reason
to hate the library.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.630
Brandon.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.138
(TIRES SQUEALING)

37:20.171 --> 37:21.407
(CRASH)

37:55.641 --> 37:57.843
This is Officer Russell,
come in.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.251
Reporting a 10-50.
I've been in an accident.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.308
Cassie?

38:32.344 --> 38:33.679
-Cassie.
-Eve, what's wrong?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.246
-Are you okay?
-It's not me.

38:35.847 --> 38:36.848
Brian.

38:57.403 --> 38:58.704
Hi.

39:01.139 --> 39:02.273
What are you
doing back here?

39:03.475 --> 39:04.810
I forgot something.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.044
(SIGHS) What?

39:07.145 --> 39:08.213
You.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.691
-He's cold.
-But sweaty.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.427
How's his pulse?

39:21.460 --> 39:22.528
Thready.

39:23.695 --> 39:24.963
BRIAN: Fast.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.333
On a scale from one to five,

39:28.366 --> 39:29.768
what's your pain level like?

39:30.502 --> 39:32.370
A two, a three...

39:32.404 --> 39:34.072
It really hurts.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.541
Can you tell me where?

39:35.574 --> 39:37.175
(SIGHS)
Just my stomach.

39:37.843 --> 39:38.977
All right.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.579
Okay, I'm gonna put
my hand here, really gently

39:40.612 --> 39:43.882
and you tell me if
the pain increases, okay?

39:43.915 --> 39:45.717
-(BRIAN WHIMPERS)
-SAM: Okay. Sorry.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.119
Yeah.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.022
What is it?
What's wrong with him?

39:51.056 --> 39:53.391
Oh, we need to get him
out of here
to figure that out. Okay?

39:54.159 --> 39:55.594
Okay.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.629
We'll go and check
on getting an ambulance.

39:57.663 --> 40:01.332
And you just stay with Brian.
And keep him calm.

40:01.366 --> 40:03.669
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I can do that.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.336
You stay calm, too.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.338
'Cause everything's
gonna be okay.

40:07.372 --> 40:08.607
All right.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.517
(EXHALES)

40:18.550 --> 40:20.986
Yeah, this is Dr. Radford,
we're gonna need an ambulance.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.488
The Grey House. Now!

40:23.154 --> 40:25.591
No, okay. No, I get it.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.193
Yeah, thanks, just hurry.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.929
It's the weather.
They don't know how soon
they can get out here.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.466
-What do you think it is?
-Ah, blockage, appendix.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.101
Some kind
of internal bleeding.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.269
I know I need a hospital
and a lab to be sure.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.906
I need to get a look
inside of him to really see
what's going on.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.774
Could he be going into shock?

40:42.808 --> 40:44.910
He's cold but sweaty,
rapid heartbeat.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.545
I'm guessing he had
low blood pressure?

40:46.578 --> 40:48.346
Yeah, he could,

40:48.379 --> 40:50.448
but it's what's causing
the shock we need
to worry about.

40:50.482 --> 40:52.250
Everything I listed
requires surgery,

40:52.283 --> 40:54.920
and delaying that is
just gonna mean more
complications for Brian.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.288
We don't have much time.
We have to keep him stable.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.491
And we do have to get him
to the hospital.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.693
This is bad.
