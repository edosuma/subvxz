00:36.784 --> 00:38.777
- Firing pin.
- Hammer.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.622
- Easy game. Name the gun part.
- Breech bolt.

00:41.706 --> 00:43.745
- Muzzle.
- Point for Steve. Good one.

00:43.833 --> 00:46.040
- Breech bolt.
- Steve guessed it.

00:46.127 --> 00:51.370
<i>- Yeah, what are you, an idiot?</i>
- Say that in mein bowl. I dare you.

00:52.509 --> 00:57.421
Wow, Hayley, some dye job.
The carpet match the curtains?

00:57.514 --> 01:00.349
- What did you do?
- I dyed it at a Green Party rally.

01:00.434 --> 01:05.345
You missed family game night for that? Wash
it out. You look like a slutty wad of money.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.022
- No way.
- Yes, way. She started it.

01:09.109 --> 01:12.775
- It's my hair. I'm keeping it.
- What's wrong with that girl?

01:12.864 --> 01:16.031
Do I have to smell of BO and hump
a redwood to get through to her?

01:16.116 --> 01:21.457
Stan, I'm sure this green hair thing is a phase.
I bet by tomorrow she'll already be over it.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.245
Something tells me you're right.

01:26.962 --> 01:31.589
Sandman's a-calling.
Shh. That's right. That's right.

01:31.675 --> 01:35.721
Big Foot's baking sugar cookies
and Santa wants to take you to the Oscars.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.429
- How's your French toast?
- Smelly and ungrateful.

01:41.519 --> 01:45.137
But this American toast is delicious.

01:45.231 --> 01:48.232
Well, Sleeping Beauty's finally up.

01:48.318 --> 01:51.901
Nice dome. You're almost as ugly as Roger.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.859
I'm not ugly. Am I?

01:54.950 --> 01:58.734
- How dare you.
- How dare I? How dare I?

01:58.828 --> 02:02.779
I was at the shooting range and left in
my earplugs. Did you say "How dare l"?

02:02.874 --> 02:04.831
- Mom.
- Stan, how could you?

02:04.918 --> 02:08.751
How could I? How could I?
Sorry. Backup pair.

02:08.839 --> 02:12.173
It's OK, honey.
You don't look like a giant penis.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.465
How can I go to school with no hair?

02:14.553 --> 02:16.629
- Already got you covered.
- Wigs?

02:16.723 --> 02:21.717
Notjust any wigs. These are styled after
our most revered Republican first ladies.

02:21.812 --> 02:25.939
The Barbara Bush. The Nancy Reagan.
The Maria Shriver.

02:26.024 --> 02:28.811
- Stay tuned.
- Those are terrible.

02:28.902 --> 02:31.904
Most girls have to go through chemo
to get a wig this nice.

02:31.989 --> 02:35.156
Do me a favour. Stay out of my life.

02:35.993 --> 02:40.738
How do I look now, Steve?
Pretty enough for you? Forget it.

02:44.752 --> 02:47.504
Turn down that rap music.
It's a bad influence.

02:47.588 --> 02:50.293
I swear, yo,
shorty be leaning on my last nerve.

02:50.383 --> 02:53.503
What do you expect?
You shaved her head in her sleep.

02:53.595 --> 02:57.639
And putting her hand in that bowl
of warm water, that was just overkill.

02:57.725 --> 03:00.927
I wanted to see if it works. It totally does.

03:01.019 --> 03:04.223
- Finally.
- Mom, is my wig straight?

03:04.314 --> 03:08.147
Perfect. What is that? Horsehair?

03:10.237 --> 03:12.645
- Jeff's here. Later.
- Who's Jeff?

03:12.739 --> 03:14.649
My boyfriend. Don't wait up.

03:14.742 --> 03:19.949
How can she be old enough to have
a boyfriend? She still wets her bed.

03:20.039 --> 03:24.333
Stan, you're so stressed. You want me
to make you happy with my mouth?

03:24.419 --> 03:26.709
Yeah, I guess so.

03:33.971 --> 03:38.218
- That helps a little.
- Maybe you'd feel better if we met this boy.

03:38.308 --> 03:40.883
Why don't we have him over for dinner?

03:40.978 --> 03:45.106
That's brilliant, Francine.
Now rephrase it so it sounds like my idea.

03:48.110 --> 03:50.602
Man, that dance is gonna be a rager.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.069
Yeah. It's too bad we can't get dates.

03:53.158 --> 03:59.659
What? Fellas, girls wanna get down
just as bad as we do. Here, here, watch.

03:59.747 --> 04:01.955
Hey, foxy.

04:03.169 --> 04:07.249
- You got something to say, Barry?
- Easy, Steve. We're just not studs.

04:07.340 --> 04:12.001
Geeks don't get the choice babes until
we're making cash in our mid-to-late 30s.

04:17.225 --> 04:20.926
You know what?
Not only am I going to that dance,

04:21.019 --> 04:24.270
but I'll bet each of you 20 bucks
I also get boob.

04:24.358 --> 04:27.643
- Bring back the bra to prove it?
- I'll do you one better.

04:27.735 --> 04:31.733
I'll wear it back.
No, actually, I'll just bring it.

04:34.535 --> 04:38.069
My surfboard nails me in the head
and I go down like a bag of rocks.

04:38.164 --> 04:41.948
And just then
my life flashes before my eyes,

04:42.042 --> 04:44.332
and I'm bored.

04:46.089 --> 04:49.837
He's bored. You took us
the other way with it, Jeff. Thank you.

04:49.926 --> 04:54.754
I just hope one day I too have a daughter
who's as smart and wonderful as Hayley.

04:54.847 --> 04:57.421
Isn't he sweet, Stan?

04:57.517 --> 05:02.393
He sure is. Next time I'm out of
Jolly Ranchers I'm just gonna suck on Jeff.

05:03.857 --> 05:05.933
Jeff, you were so good at dinner.

05:06.026 --> 05:11.531
Babe, we're good together. Which is why
I was thinking you should move in with me.

05:11.616 --> 05:15.660
It's only been three weeks.
I don't think my dad would be too happy.

05:15.745 --> 05:19.493
Babe, your dad digs me.
I can tell he wants us to be together.

05:23.878 --> 05:27.378
Great. Now it's officially a sausage-fest.

05:27.465 --> 05:33.753
See you tomorrow, fellas. Hey, Sanchez,
try to get to work on time for a change.

05:33.847 --> 05:37.181
No fair. Don't make me come up there.

05:37.268 --> 05:39.509
Yeah? Yeah, you better fly.

05:40.729 --> 05:43.137
What a bunch of clowns.

05:44.150 --> 05:47.400
There. Now you can talk
and we took care of that moustache.

05:47.486 --> 05:52.778
- Are you insane? You can'tjust abduct me.
- Don't you use that word in this house.

05:52.868 --> 05:57.031
I liberated you. Maybe now you'll
think twice before dating the wrong guy.

05:57.122 --> 06:00.705
- There's nothing wrong with Jeff.
- I forbid you to see him.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.746
- Stan, I'm not sure we...
- Francine, wait in the car.

06:03.837 --> 06:07.289
This is for your own good.
Jeff was much too relaxed at dinner.

06:07.382 --> 06:11.428
- He had the laid-back attitude of a stone man.
- You mean a stoner?

06:11.511 --> 06:14.845
- Go wait in the car.
- You can't do this. I'm 18.

06:14.932 --> 06:17.969
While you're under my roof,
you'll live by my rules.

06:18.061 --> 06:21.808
Dude, this is your house. And you're alive.

06:23.358 --> 06:26.561
Guess what? I don't have
to listen to your rules any more.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.693
- I'm moving in with Jeff.
- What?

06:28.780 --> 06:31.947
- Right on, babe.
- Hayley, don't go.

06:32.033 --> 06:36.529
You get back here, Hayley.
No? I didn't want to have to use this.

06:36.622 --> 06:38.365
- Rhubarb.
- Rhubarb?

06:38.456 --> 06:41.457
Her trigger word.
I had her brainwashed at five.

06:41.543 --> 06:46.786
She's supposed to kill Walter Mondale,
but I guess it didn't take.

06:47.884 --> 06:50.920
- Come on, let's go to your place.
- This is my place.

06:51.012 --> 06:55.758
- What? You live in your van?
- No. We live in our van.

06:55.850 --> 06:59.434
My mom had me right where you're sitting.

07:03.066 --> 07:05.474
How could you not tell me
you live in your van?

07:05.568 --> 07:08.439
Babe, we did it, we took the plunge.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.736
Come celebrate on the patio.

07:10.824 --> 07:13.861
Can we get out of here?
I gotta get away from my parents.

07:13.952 --> 07:16.870
This van is our pen
and the road is our parchment,

07:16.955 --> 07:20.122
and together we'll drive a poem
across America.

07:24.922 --> 07:28.587
Yup, this is the spot.
We are right where we need to be.

07:28.676 --> 07:30.752
I gotta use the can.

07:33.515 --> 07:37.263
Stan. I can't believe our little girl moved out.

07:37.353 --> 07:39.760
Francine, you are gonna love this.

07:39.855 --> 07:43.188
Jeff - you know Jeff - Jeff lives in this van

07:43.275 --> 07:46.229
and the piece ofjunk
just broke down right outside.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.819
- She's not going anywhere.
- Stan, are you sure she's...

07:49.906 --> 07:54.368
At least the last time you ran away
you made it all the way to the stop sign.

07:54.453 --> 07:56.529
That's funny. I'm funny.

07:56.622 --> 08:00.952
- Don't egg her on. She'll never come back.
- She hates it in there.

08:01.044 --> 08:05.788
<i>By morning she'll be back wearing footsie</i>
pyjamas, sucking on her Lion King blankie.

08:05.883 --> 08:09.796
- But she got rid of those things years ago.
- Not in here she didn't.

08:11.889 --> 08:14.640
Stan. Our little girl is back.

08:14.725 --> 08:18.805
- I didn't order rude service.
- Roger, why aren't you in the attic?

08:18.897 --> 08:23.523
It's so cold and draughty. Which is great
for a Michelob, but I gotta sleep there.

08:23.609 --> 08:26.610
That's good. That's not too bright. That's fine.

08:26.696 --> 08:28.854
Stan, she's still out there.

08:30.991 --> 08:34.905
What is she squatting over?
Hayley, that's not how you make coffee.

08:34.995 --> 08:38.578
- Is Roger moving into Hayley's room?
- No, he is not.

08:38.667 --> 08:44.123
Fine. I'll go up to the attic. I'm supposed to
bring pneumonia back to my planet anyway.

08:44.214 --> 08:48.543
Stan, I want my baby girl home.
Just go down there and apologise.

08:48.635 --> 08:51.756
No. No apologies. George W taught me that.

08:51.848 --> 08:54.849
I just have to remind her
how great life is at home.

08:54.933 --> 09:01.268
Keep tonight open. Marco and Sky are having
a wine-and-cheese thing in their Tercel.

09:02.609 --> 09:05.443
Hi, Hayley.
Got you a clown and a petting zoo.

09:05.529 --> 09:09.442
Sure you don't wanna move back in?
Maybe the clown will ride the pig.

09:09.533 --> 09:11.941
Man, we're having fun.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.074
- How long do I have you?
- Two hours.

09:15.164 --> 09:18.117
Go read to my wife.

09:23.715 --> 09:27.000
- How's the bra hunt coming?
- Making progress.

09:27.093 --> 09:30.094
A girl just groped me with her foot.

09:32.349 --> 09:35.468
What the heck? Since when
does Frankle reel in the babes?

09:35.560 --> 09:40.851
He's got the sympathy factor. His brother
got his arm stuck in a ski lift. Tore it right off.

09:40.941 --> 09:43.977
- Boy, that sucks.
- Not for Frankle.

09:44.070 --> 09:47.355
Sure, girls. I'll judge your kissing contest.

09:49.282 --> 09:52.070
- Good news, Francine.
- Hayley's back?

09:52.161 --> 09:56.325
- Even better. Say hello to your new daughter.
- What?

09:56.415 --> 09:59.037
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Is that a Chinese baby?

09:59.126 --> 10:03.670
- Sure is. Japanese, to be specific.
- Stan. I don't want a new daughter.

10:03.756 --> 10:06.627
Don't you get it? I want my Hayley.

10:09.262 --> 10:10.922
One of us pooped.

10:13.266 --> 10:16.884
Hayley, what happened?
You used to be so easy.

10:16.979 --> 10:18.770
- Eat your peas.
- Why?

10:18.855 --> 10:22.771
So you're strong enough to fight off
Clinton's sexual advances.

10:22.860 --> 10:25.731
There he is, right outside.

10:28.158 --> 10:31.608
Hey, did you hear?
Sanders just killed his first dictator.

10:31.703 --> 10:36.910
Well, first he was a US ally then a dictator.
Yeah, a dictator. I mean, it's good, I'm happy.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.618
We gotta celebrate. How about drinks
at the place with the buffet?

10:40.712 --> 10:43.629
- Great.
- So, Stan, did Hayley move back in?

10:43.715 --> 10:49.054
No. Francine is devastated. If she's this upset
now, what'll she be like when Hayley dies?

10:49.138 --> 10:52.305
Have you talked to Hayley?
Let her know you want her home?

10:52.391 --> 10:56.010
Absolutely not.
I could never grovel to my own daughter.

10:56.103 --> 10:59.104
But I think I know someone who could.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.432
- Paper or plastic?
- Burlap.

11:01.526 --> 11:04.645
I too share your annoying concern
for the environment.

11:04.737 --> 11:08.782
- Dad?
- No. I am former communist named Petrov.

11:08.867 --> 11:13.825
I too embrace insane left-wing philosophies
which are best discussed in parents' home.

11:13.914 --> 11:16.120
- Dad, leave me alone.
- I've had enough.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.284
You're coming home or else.

11:18.376 --> 11:21.581
- Or else what?
- That'll be 38.40.

11:23.090 --> 11:27.633
Or else you can't use this. We gave you
this card and I can damn well take it back.

11:27.720 --> 11:31.552
- Fine. I don't need your money.
- Good, cos I'm cutting you off.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.510
- Petrov, go restock that stuff.
- Can't Susan do it?

11:34.602 --> 11:36.679
I on break in, like, two minutes.

11:39.440 --> 11:43.771
- Thanks for tutoring me.
- Did you hear about Frankle's brother's arm?

11:43.862 --> 11:47.694
Yeah. Poor Frankle.
I just wanted to hug him and never let go.

11:47.783 --> 11:52.611
Yeah, yeah. I remember
when my sister had her accident.

11:52.705 --> 11:57.497
<i>Did I not mention my sister, who was</i>
horrifically burned over 98% of her body?

11:57.585 --> 12:01.203
- That's terrible.
- Only her taint survived.

12:01.297 --> 12:05.958
OK, it's on. You pull this off and I'll convince
my parents to let you sleep in here.

12:06.052 --> 12:11.556
I've been studying. I even watched that Meg
Ryan movie where she plays that burn victim.

12:11.641 --> 12:15.935
- She never played a burn victim.
- Meg, honey.

12:16.021 --> 12:18.097
Kim, meet my sister Hayley.

12:18.648 --> 12:23.441
Time for your burn cream.
I hope I don't cry like last time.

12:23.529 --> 12:26.945
- What happened?
- I was dating a pool guy.

12:27.032 --> 12:32.074
He thought it would be kinky to give
each other chlorine massages. I went first.

12:32.162 --> 12:34.951
- That's cooling.
- How awful.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.326
- I know. I'm hideous.
- You are so not hideous.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.542
- Don't tease me.
- No, really.

12:40.630 --> 12:44.248
It's your eyes
and the unique shape of your head.

12:44.342 --> 12:46.418
I think you're beautiful.

12:46.511 --> 12:48.968
And Steve's been a super little brother -

12:49.056 --> 12:52.223
freezing my Snickers,
sticking me in the shade outside.

12:52.309 --> 12:55.927
- Steve, that is so sweet.
- I know. Wanna go to the dance?

12:56.021 --> 12:58.726
- I'd love to.
- Great. Well, see you, Hayley.

13:00.109 --> 13:02.481
I am beautiful.

13:03.528 --> 13:05.937
Saw my tushie.

13:13.831 --> 13:17.664
Impressive. A lesbian of colour
couldn't have done a betterjob.

13:17.752 --> 13:20.374
I'd give it an A. If you had paid your tuition.

13:20.463 --> 13:24.296
What? But I'm paid up for the semester. Dad.

13:24.385 --> 13:27.171
There are no free rides here.

13:27.262 --> 13:31.094
- You have three days to pay your tuition.
- A semester's tuition?

13:31.183 --> 13:34.635
How am I supposed
to come up with 85 bucks in three days?

13:34.728 --> 13:37.813
Welcome to House of Hoagies.
Can I get you a sandwich

13:37.898 --> 13:40.188
with nothing on it?

13:41.819 --> 13:44.311
- Bring me a beer.
- I just brought you one.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.739
Yeah, this one's to drown my crabs.

13:49.285 --> 13:51.409
Don't worry, doll. It gets easier.

13:51.497 --> 13:55.079
At least I'm not being exploited
like these poor strippers.

13:55.166 --> 14:00.126
- Sweetie, these girls are being empowered.
- Yeah, right.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.670
Think about it. They show their breasts,

14:02.759 --> 14:07.754
and men hand over hundreds
of their hard-earned dollars.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.840
Who's really being exploited here?

14:11.934 --> 14:15.019
To quote Camille Paglia,
they are sexual conquerors,

14:15.104 --> 14:19.351
controlling the channel between nature
and culture. Take it off, bitch.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.684
Camille Paglia?

14:23.196 --> 14:27.905
<i>- Everything work out with Hayley?</i>
- No, I had to cut her off like a diseased hand.

14:27.993 --> 14:31.279
Like any diseased hand,
she'll soon come flopping back.

14:31.372 --> 14:34.576
- They always do.
- I got her right where I want her.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.825
All right, gentlemen.

14:36.919 --> 14:40.205
Let's welcome to the stage, Dusty.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.886
My God. What is she doing?

14:48.973 --> 14:54.846
Pretending to ride a horse. If you wanna see
a real horse you gotta go to the track.

14:56.774 --> 14:59.347
We're all leaving. The girls here are vugly.

14:59.443 --> 15:01.685
We can't leave, we just got here.

15:08.452 --> 15:12.035
Somebody pulled the alarm.
You know what that means.

15:12.123 --> 15:16.999
Dusty, you're on fire,
and that's a double dance for you.

15:20.465 --> 15:22.589
- How could you let Hayley do this?
- What?

15:22.676 --> 15:24.834
Don't play dumb. She's stripping.

15:24.928 --> 15:29.840
Showing people her Ho Hos,
her Ding Dongs, her Suzy Q's, her...

15:29.933 --> 15:34.928
God, what are those called, the little
pink with coconut? They're really good.

15:35.022 --> 15:36.766
- Snowballs?
- You bastard.

15:36.857 --> 15:39.728
- I didn't know she was stripping.
- Don't lie to me.

15:39.818 --> 15:42.393
For real. She said she was out torching SUVs.

15:42.489 --> 15:44.861
- I'd never be cool with stripping.
- Really?

15:44.950 --> 15:48.531
Yeah. I've dated three strippers
and two of them turned up dead.

15:48.619 --> 15:53.246
The cops always go to the boyfriend with
the van. That's profiling, and that's wrong.

15:53.334 --> 15:57.461
That's the price you pay for the
sweet pleasure of van ownership. Let's go.

16:00.257 --> 16:04.208
Kim. You look great.
But the dance isn't for two hours.

16:04.303 --> 16:09.380
Yeah, but I gotta be up early for church camp,
so I thought we'd fool around beforehand.

16:09.850 --> 16:12.139
Thank you, Jesus.

16:13.187 --> 16:16.272
Wait. Can I say hi to your charred sister first?

16:16.357 --> 16:20.058
I was thinking some mascara.
You know, to draw focus to my eyes.

16:20.152 --> 16:23.902
You know, some blush
would really bring out your cheekbones.

16:23.990 --> 16:27.739
I love that idea. Paint me, paint me.

16:35.377 --> 16:37.750
Yeah. Who's your daddy?

16:37.839 --> 16:39.416
- I am.
- Dad.

16:39.507 --> 16:43.421
Blow up many 4Runners today
or did you 4get?

16:43.512 --> 16:46.631
- Jeff, I'll do the talking.
- Let me go.

16:46.722 --> 16:51.349
- Hey, she's not going anywhere.
- Yeah? Who's gonna stop me?

16:51.436 --> 16:56.975
I see. Well, I don't want any trouble.
I'll just be on my merry little way.

17:01.989 --> 17:07.280
Hey, Bo Peep, I know
where you can find your sheep. In hell.

17:11.330 --> 17:16.576
Hayley, are you in there? I brought some
fresh laundry and rinsed out your tinkle can.

17:16.671 --> 17:19.162
Hello?

17:21.384 --> 17:24.054
Hayley's working at a booby bar?

17:24.137 --> 17:26.972
And she traded shifts with Tina?

17:27.056 --> 17:30.093
What does Tina have to do
that's so important?

17:30.185 --> 17:32.972
Wait. This isn't about Tina.

17:33.063 --> 17:35.139
This isn't about Tina.

17:35.232 --> 17:38.483
It's never been about Tina.

17:38.569 --> 17:42.353
Kim, we are running out of time
if we're gonna, you know, get busy.

17:42.448 --> 17:45.117
Here I come.

17:45.869 --> 17:48.954
You look gorgeous.
Doesn't she look gorgeous?

17:49.038 --> 17:51.612
Stunning. Can I talk to you, sis?

17:51.708 --> 17:54.378
Cut it out. I should be
touching her na-nas now.

17:54.461 --> 17:56.537
All you had to do was sit and be ugly.

17:56.629 --> 17:59.583
- I am not ugly.
- Steve.

17:59.675 --> 18:04.087
That's not what I said. Tell her.
Or maybe you don't want this room any more.

18:04.179 --> 18:08.426
He wants to lock me in the attic
like I'm some kind of disgusting monster.

18:08.517 --> 18:10.012
- You are.
- Shut up.

18:10.103 --> 18:12.344
You shut up.

18:13.814 --> 18:16.934
I never want to see you again, Steve.

18:17.027 --> 18:19.232
Roger, I thought we had a deal.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.736
Rouge can make a fella
do crazy things, Steve.

18:22.824 --> 18:26.074
- Sorry I ruined your plan.
- Sorry I called you ugly.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.495
Well, I guess I'll go let the guys know
I'm a loser after all.

18:29.581 --> 18:31.538
Steve, wait.

18:31.624 --> 18:33.831
Kimmy loaned this to me.

18:33.919 --> 18:37.288
Roger, you are beautiful.

18:41.635 --> 18:43.877
Way to go, Mr S.

18:45.931 --> 18:47.971
You're so hot.

18:52.690 --> 18:57.481
I remember now.
I was gonna be a civil engineer.

18:58.945 --> 19:01.402
What are you gonna do? Tickle me to death?

19:11.584 --> 19:14.704
- You're coming home.
- I don't have to listen to you.

19:14.795 --> 19:17.168
Stop. Just stop right there.

19:17.256 --> 19:20.673
We've tried doing things your way
and it's made things worse.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.710
- But she's making so many mistakes.
- You sound just like my father.

19:24.806 --> 19:28.721
- He never supported my choices.
- My dad didn't support me either.

19:28.810 --> 19:31.384
- That's why I started stripping.
- Me too.

19:31.479 --> 19:34.397
- Same here.
- Yeah. Plus my uncle touched me.

19:34.483 --> 19:39.192
- I never meant to drive Hayley away.
- Stan, we need to listen to these ho bags.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.115
Hayley will make mistakes,
but they're hers to make,

19:42.200 --> 19:45.818
and as parents the most important thing
we can do is be supportive.

19:45.911 --> 19:48.947
Supportive? Yes.

19:52.752 --> 19:55.243
Shake it, baby. You will not break it.

19:55.338 --> 19:57.414
It took me nine months to make it.

19:57.506 --> 20:01.457
- Give me some more singles.
- You used to look like that.

20:01.553 --> 20:04.258
- What are you guys doing?
- Being supportive.

20:04.347 --> 20:08.641
I've been treating you like a little girl
and, well, you're a grown woman.

20:08.727 --> 20:11.515
You've made that clear
during that Jay-Z song.

20:11.605 --> 20:14.274
- Come back home, honey.
- What do you say?

20:14.358 --> 20:18.936
- Give your old man a second chance?
- I'll think about it.

20:19.030 --> 20:23.692
You have terrific parents. I guess you're
done here and you'll be going back home?

20:23.785 --> 20:28.327
Yeah. Then again, the girls are really nice
and the money's awesome.

20:28.414 --> 20:31.203
Nah, I think I'll stay. Hit it, Ron.

20:37.925 --> 20:39.752
That's gross.

20:39.843 --> 20:43.462
That's the one place
you want them to have hair.

20:46.517 --> 20:49.721
- I got a good one.
- "Quivix"? That's not a word.

20:49.812 --> 20:53.145
- It is on my planet.
- Is it a proper noun?

20:53.232 --> 20:55.142
- Damn.
- I'm going out with Jeff.

20:55.234 --> 20:57.441
- Hey, be home by 11.
- Dad.

20:57.529 --> 21:00.898
- OK. Just be safe.
- Thanks, Daddy.

21:02.951 --> 21:07.661
Do you have visual? Stay three car lengths
behind and check in with me every half-hour.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.749
Yes, I know she's got a great ass.
Stay on it.
