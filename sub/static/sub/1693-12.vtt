Halloran:
How do you explain this,
mrs. Pratt?

00:06.999 --> 00:08.800
Take this

00:08.834 --> 00:11.152
Jimmy:
<i>This strike</i>

00:11.186 --> 00:12.903
I plan to make your
murder charge go away.

00:12.921 --> 00:15.473
Chalky:
<i>The families of my men</i>

00:15.507 --> 00:16.974
$3,000 apiece.

00:17.009 --> 00:19.344
And them three
hooded crackers
did the shootin'?

00:19.378 --> 00:21.562
I want them delivered
to me personally.

00:21.597 --> 00:24.382
Nucky:
<i>There's roughly</i>
<i>160,000 acres.</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:26.718
I've instructed bill fallon
to draw up papers

00:26.752 --> 00:30.154
Transferring it all
to your name exclusively.

00:30.189 --> 00:32.406
If you're willing
to testify that you
committed the murder

00:32.458 --> 00:36.494

00:41.183 --> 00:44.936
About a year ago
the deacon held our annual
week of miracles.

00:44.970 --> 00:48.222
<i>Your agent van alden</i>

00:48.257 --> 00:50.608
<i>He drowned that fella</i>

- Randolph: Agent van alden.
- Hands straight

00:56.849 --> 00:58.449
I've been
subpoenaed.

00:58.484 --> 01:00.351
Are you actually talking
about testifying?

01:00.386 --> 01:04.288
If you want to punish yourself
because your daughter got sick,
that's your business,

01:04.322 --> 01:07.308
But I will not permit you
to sacrifice me.

01:07.342 --> 01:09.610
- Mickey: Jimmy's coming back.
- Seems unlikely.

01:09.661 --> 01:11.429

- Capone: <i>Then who did?</i>

01:11.447 --> 01:14.182
- Mickey: <i>Manny horvitz.</i>
- Gillian: <i>Poor girl.</i>

Five seconds, gentlemen.

04:11.693 --> 04:13.611
<i>( distant cantor singing )</i>

04:13.645 --> 04:16.113
Everyone's a crook.

04:17.515 --> 04:19.951
Little crooks

04:19.985 --> 04:22.653
Take from who they can.

04:25.657 --> 04:28.209
Nobodies stealing
from nobodies.

04:29.361 --> 04:32.380
Then the middleman.
Hmm.

04:32.414 --> 04:35.750
How many nobodies
does it take to feed him?

04:36.701 --> 04:38.836
Seven?

04:38.870 --> 04:40.972
10?

04:42.090 --> 04:44.475
The middleman
is always hungry,

04:44.509 --> 04:47.428
Always worried.

04:48.313 --> 04:50.314
Because from the middle,

04:50.349 --> 04:54.151
It's easier to fall down
than to climb up.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.691
But the big crooks--

05:00.725 --> 05:03.194
The <i>machers</i> in odessa--

05:03.228 --> 05:06.747
The big crook
does nothing.

05:06.782 --> 05:08.833
Drink kvass,

05:08.867 --> 05:12.069
Eat roast chicken

05:20.629 --> 05:23.965
The big crook in odessa,
he's somebody.

05:24.016 --> 05:27.418
I wake up sometimes

05:27.436 --> 05:30.187
And I think
I'm still there--

05:30.222 --> 05:33.590
12 years old,
my whole life ahead of me.

05:33.608 --> 05:37.011
But then I realize

I'm in america,

05:48.440 --> 05:50.992
I sketched it out

05:51.043 --> 05:55.129
I must stay away from home--
for the safety of my family.

05:55.213 --> 05:57.631
Close my shop.

05:57.666 --> 05:59.967
I'm living like a beggar.

06:00.002 --> 06:01.802
Bit of bad luck.
Happen to anyone.

06:01.837 --> 06:04.388
But my bad luck
has a name--

06:04.423 --> 06:06.424
Waxey gordon.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.292
Let me stop you

06:08.310 --> 06:10.478
Whatever your problems,
waxey gordon

06:10.512 --> 06:12.346
Is a business partner
of mine.

06:12.397 --> 06:14.865
Are you sure about this,
mr. Thompson?

06:14.900 --> 06:17.735
Do you know
something I don't?

06:17.769 --> 06:20.988
The question
answers itself.

06:21.023 --> 06:22.773
Nucky's a busy
fella, manny.

06:22.807 --> 06:24.358
And I have
nothing better to do?

06:24.409 --> 06:26.810
You're hiding
in the basement
of a synagogue.

06:26.828 --> 06:29.880
Don't waste his time.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.867
Your partner waxey gordon

06:32.918 --> 06:34.785
Is in business
with james darmody.

06:34.819 --> 06:38.255
<i>Would you say we have</i>
<i>something in common?</i>

06:38.290 --> 06:41.459
- We might.
- Then let us help each other.

06:41.493 --> 06:44.628
You give me waxey,
I give you darmody

06:44.662 --> 06:46.764
And we make
business together.

06:46.798 --> 06:49.100
You'll "give him"
to me?

06:49.134 --> 06:52.636
In all honesty,

06:52.670 --> 06:55.222
You don't look
to be in a condition
to do anything.

06:57.342 --> 07:02.513
Well, if the boychik's wife
could still talk,

07:02.531 --> 07:05.182
She'd tell you otherwise.

07:07.819 --> 07:11.688
Maybe we have
less in common than
you think, mr. Horvitz.

07:11.706 --> 07:15.126
You said he was
open to discussion.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.877
I said I'd broker
the meet.

07:16.912 --> 07:19.463
So you're too big a crook

07:19.498 --> 07:21.198
To be seen
with the likes of me?

07:21.216 --> 07:24.135
According to the federal
prosecutor, yes.

07:24.169 --> 07:27.304
But I will consider
your proposition.

07:28.723 --> 07:31.208
Make sure mickey knows
how to get in touch.

07:33.762 --> 07:37.414
He's heading to jail
and this is the look
he gives me?

07:37.449 --> 07:40.017
<i>( doors close )</i>

07:40.051 --> 07:42.069
He ain't in jail yet.

For the families
of each victim.

- I know you did.

08:50.422 --> 08:53.507
- The three pieces of shit
that shot this place up.
- You sure about that?

08:53.558 --> 08:57.928
- Ask them yourself.
- That gonna be <i>my</i> pleasure.

08:57.962 --> 09:01.815
- ( loud whimpers )

dropped my case.

09:01.850 --> 09:05.519
You can tell your daddy
I'll call off the strike.

09:05.570 --> 09:07.988
I will.
And you can do
something for me.

09:12.527 --> 09:14.978
Tell nucky I want to talk.

09:23.538 --> 09:25.155
Welcome back, fellas!

09:26.208 --> 09:28.959
- No!
- Come on, take him, boys.

09:31.663 --> 09:33.714
- Come on.
- No no!

09:37.269 --> 09:39.220

Good girl!
That's it.

10:23.515 --> 10:27.034

Mr. Thompson.

10:37.112 --> 10:40.748
- Where is mrs. Schroeder?
- She left, sir,
20 minutes ago.

10:40.782 --> 10:43.417
She didn't say
where she was going.

10:46.671 --> 10:49.206
Lilian.  Emily.
Katy.

10:55.597 --> 10:57.798
<i>( bell rings )</i>

10:59.417 --> 11:01.251
She brings a priest?

11:01.269 --> 11:04.555
I'm surprised she doesn't
have an infant suckling
at her breast.

11:06.641 --> 11:09.226
Bring me back
a shaved cherry ice.

11:09.260 --> 11:11.528
I'm boiling.

11:12.947 --> 11:16.066
Mrs. Schroeder?
How do you do?
I'm esther randolph.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.819
This is father brennan.
He's here--

11:18.870 --> 11:20.871
I'm here
for moral support.

11:20.905 --> 11:22.539
I don't think
I'll need it.

11:22.574 --> 11:24.325
I meant
for mrs. Schroeder.

11:24.376 --> 11:26.943
She understood that,
father.

11:28.246 --> 11:29.997
<i>Mrs. Schroeder</i>
<i>has left her children--</i>

11:30.048 --> 11:32.916
Including
her sickly daughter--
to be here today.

11:32.950 --> 11:36.487
- What's wrong with her?
- Polio.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.756
I'm terribly sorry.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.759
Mrs. Schroeder is a widow
and devoted mother.

11:41.793 --> 11:43.894
She is active
in the church

11:43.928 --> 11:46.430
And ignorant of any
of the charges
in this case.

11:46.464 --> 11:48.399
I didn't realize they taught
law at the seminary.

11:48.433 --> 11:51.852
<i>Perhaps we can let</i>
<i>mrs. Schroeder speak</i>
<i>for herself.</i>

11:51.903 --> 11:55.138
- There's nothing she--
- I'd like to speak
with miss randolph alone.

11:55.156 --> 11:58.342
- I'm not sure that--
- thank you, father.

11:59.577 --> 12:03.280
Well, I suppose
I'll buy some stamps.

12:13.591 --> 12:16.043
Is it difficult
to become a lawyer?

12:16.094 --> 12:18.829
Not if you set
your mind to it

12:18.847 --> 12:21.231
And don't take no
for an answer.

12:22.183 --> 12:24.518
I doubt it was
that simple.

12:24.552 --> 12:26.937
You're right.

12:27.004 --> 12:29.606
I started as
a public defender.

12:29.641 --> 12:32.526
As you might imagine,
my only clients
were women.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.478
What kind of women?

12:34.512 --> 12:36.713
The kind who don't have
any other choice.

12:36.748 --> 12:38.348
Are you saying I did?

12:38.366 --> 12:41.184
Why don't you tell me?
You cleared the room.

12:44.823 --> 12:47.374
My husband beat me.

12:47.409 --> 12:49.693
He beat our children.

12:49.711 --> 12:51.662
He was a drunkard

12:51.696 --> 12:53.313
And a philanderer.

12:53.348 --> 12:56.583
And now you've moved up
in the world.

12:58.887 --> 13:01.238
Do you hate mr. Thompson?

13:01.272 --> 13:03.807
No, I rather like him.

13:03.842 --> 13:07.177
Not that it matters.
Do you hate him?

13:09.798 --> 13:11.949
Your feelings
are complicated.

13:11.983 --> 13:14.651
The truth is complicated
as well.

13:14.686 --> 13:17.871
Then I'd be very
interested in hearing
what you have to say.

13:18.990 --> 13:20.941
Would I have
to appear in court?

13:20.992 --> 13:25.329
I'll compel you to testify,
whether you cooperate
with me or not.

13:25.363 --> 13:28.999
<i>I can paint you either way</i>
<i>on that witness stand,</i>
<i>it's really up to you:</i>

13:29.033 --> 13:30.951
<i>The helpless widow</i>

13:31.035 --> 13:34.054
<i>Unwittingly drawn in</i>
<i>by her husband's killer,</i>

13:34.088 --> 13:36.457
Or the shameless gold-digger
seduced by money.

13:36.508 --> 13:38.926
Does it matter to you
that neither of those are true?

13:38.960 --> 13:41.762
( sternly )
it matters that
enoch thompson goes to jail.

13:52.273 --> 13:55.058
What has he given you
besides money?

13:58.062 --> 14:00.280
He's never been
cruel to me.

14:00.315 --> 14:02.716
He's been plenty cruel
to others.

14:02.750 --> 14:06.119
I've never seen it.

14:06.154 --> 14:08.288
But you know it anyway.

14:11.409 --> 14:12.993
I have children.

14:13.044 --> 14:15.546
And does their well-being
trump everyone else's?

14:15.580 --> 14:17.965
The victims as well
as the criminals?

14:17.999 --> 14:20.584
- If you had your own,
you'd never ask.
- <i>If I had my own,</i>

14:20.618 --> 14:24.555
I couldn't bear knowing
that their comfort was bought
with the blood of others.

14:24.589 --> 14:27.758
Because sooner or later
they'll find out themselves

14:27.792 --> 14:31.228
And that won't be
a happy day.

14:33.765 --> 14:35.933
If I did what you ask,

14:35.967 --> 14:38.001
What becomes of me?

14:38.036 --> 14:40.637
You'll never have
to see him again.

14:42.824 --> 14:45.242
Set yourself free,
mrs. Schroeder.

14:45.276 --> 14:49.312
You'd be amazed
at how much better
you'll feel.

14:54.619 --> 14:57.120
How do you "order" someone
to commit murder?

14:57.154 --> 14:59.373
- It's fucking ludicrous.
- That's my position.

14:59.424 --> 15:02.543
If I ordered them
to step in front of a train,
would they do that too?

15:02.594 --> 15:04.494
If they would,
your troubles are over.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.679
God damn it.
Eddie!

15:05.713 --> 15:09.016
- <i>Ja?</i>
- Why is this bourbon empty?

15:09.100 --> 15:10.934
Someone drank it.

15:10.969 --> 15:14.187
- You're cracking wise now?
- I will refill it immediately.

15:16.173 --> 15:18.141
Bring some ice,
for god's sake.

15:18.175 --> 15:20.143
It's fucking
sweltering.

15:27.368 --> 15:30.037
We should discuss your brother.
If you could talk to him--

15:30.071 --> 15:32.489
- In protective custody?
- Get word through his lawyer.

15:32.523 --> 15:34.708
- Make him an offer
of some kind.
- Which is swell,

15:34.742 --> 15:37.210
Except we both know
he's not the real problem.

15:38.212 --> 15:41.031
<i>( eddie hacking at ice )</i>

15:41.049 --> 15:44.801
- I suppose there is
an elephant in the room.
- <i>If you're referring to</i>

15:44.836 --> 15:47.054
The woman who sleeps
in the bed in which I am
no longer welcome,

15:47.088 --> 15:48.889
Then yes,
there certainly is.

15:48.923 --> 15:52.208
- Her testimony's
what'll sink you.
- She doesn't know anything.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.061
But even if the jury
thinks she does,

15:54.095 --> 15:56.063
That's enough to corroborate
eli and halloran.

15:56.097 --> 15:58.565
- They're accomplices.  They'll
say anything to get off.
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>

15:58.600 --> 16:00.884
And juries know that.
But if there's an independent
corroboration

16:00.902 --> 16:03.654
Of what those
accomplices allege,
even by inference--

16:03.688 --> 16:05.405
It could be enough
to convict you.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.890
<i>( phone rings )</i>

16:06.908 --> 16:09.059
The bottom line's that

16:09.077 --> 16:12.562
If your lady-friend
testifies...

16:14.282 --> 16:17.784
Ahem.  Chalky white
is on the line.

16:21.856 --> 16:25.008
<i>( waves breaking,</i>
<i>wind chimes ringing )</i>

16:25.043 --> 16:27.878
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

16:58.626 --> 17:01.878
<i>( car approaching )</i>

17:35.312 --> 17:37.147
Hello?

17:38.983 --> 17:40.984
Nucky.

17:44.338 --> 17:45.589
Your door was open.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.509
This is owen sleater.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.971
You could wait outside.

18:02.223 --> 18:04.858
It's okay.
I used to do your job.

18:06.944 --> 18:09.029
You're the reason
I'm doing it now.

18:19.356 --> 18:21.458
I'm sorry
about angela.

18:23.494 --> 18:25.378
Manny horvitz.

18:27.415 --> 18:29.699
Philadelphia.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.718
Never heard of him.

18:31.753 --> 18:34.171
He used to work
for waxey gordon.

18:36.340 --> 18:38.058
He came for me,

18:38.092 --> 18:39.843
Found her instead.

18:39.877 --> 18:42.679
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

18:44.599 --> 18:46.216
No thank you.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.740
To the lost.

19:00.615 --> 19:02.732
My father's dead.

19:06.254 --> 19:08.738
I should have
killed him...

19:08.756 --> 19:11.424
The moment he suggested
betraying you.

19:13.511 --> 19:15.929
I thought about it
since I was a kid--

19:15.963 --> 19:17.931
Killing him.

19:19.016 --> 19:21.751
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what stopped me.</i>

19:21.769 --> 19:24.554
He was your father,
james.

19:24.588 --> 19:27.023
Nothing looms larger.

19:27.058 --> 19:29.726
<i>Last year when he was sick,</i>
<i>I went to see him.</i>

19:29.760 --> 19:32.362
He looked... Pathetic.

19:32.396 --> 19:35.031
He was scared

19:35.066 --> 19:36.733
And he was trembling.

19:36.767 --> 19:39.703
I put my hand
on his chest.

19:39.737 --> 19:41.905
I looked into his eyes.

19:41.939 --> 19:44.274
And he said,

19:44.292 --> 19:47.828
"you're a good son."

19:54.752 --> 19:57.254
Knocked the wind
out of me.

20:00.624 --> 20:02.959
I know there's
nothing I can say,

20:02.977 --> 20:05.145
Nuck.

20:06.297 --> 20:09.015
Maybe there's
something I can do.

20:09.066 --> 20:10.517
For me?

20:10.568 --> 20:13.353
How about
telling the truth?

20:15.773 --> 20:19.609
- I was angry.
- About what?

20:19.643 --> 20:21.411
<i>Who I was.</i>

20:21.445 --> 20:23.496
<i>Who you are.</i>

20:24.699 --> 20:27.033
What I'd been through--
over there.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.621
The shooting...

20:34.275 --> 20:37.143
I never meant
for that to happen.

20:37.178 --> 20:39.012
Then why did it?

20:56.113 --> 20:58.782
You said you wanted
to talk, james.

20:58.816 --> 21:01.201
And suddenly
you're very quiet.

21:07.524 --> 21:09.826
It was eli.

21:12.029 --> 21:14.214
And you had nothing
to do with it?

21:15.366 --> 21:17.550
Let me make things right.

21:19.003 --> 21:21.871
Or as right
as they can be.

21:24.708 --> 21:27.560
Just tell me
how to help you.

21:48.282 --> 21:50.617
<i>( rustles )</i>

21:56.707 --> 21:58.675
A scarf?
In this weather?

21:58.709 --> 22:01.678
It'll be winter
soon enough.

22:03.097 --> 22:05.098
I need to speak
with you.

22:19.697 --> 22:22.649
We were both
raised catholic,

22:22.700 --> 22:24.985
But I suppose
it's fair to say

22:25.036 --> 22:28.288
That we have
fundamental differences
in our approach to religion.

22:28.322 --> 22:31.124
You lost your faith.

22:31.158 --> 22:33.293
If there really is a god,

22:33.327 --> 22:35.412
Would he have
given me this mug?

22:37.748 --> 22:41.751
Look, maybe there is
some being in the sky

22:41.785 --> 22:44.137
Who sits in judgment.

22:44.171 --> 22:45.788
We'll all find out
soon enough.

22:45.806 --> 22:49.092
But my relationship
to whatever that is,

22:49.126 --> 22:52.128
It doesn't need rules.

22:53.731 --> 22:56.632
So your version of god
asks nothing?

22:56.650 --> 23:00.303
It asks that
I love my family,

23:00.321 --> 23:03.973
That I care for them
and protect them.

23:05.826 --> 23:08.695
There is more
god in the love
I feel for you

23:08.746 --> 23:12.982
And those children than
in all the churches
in rome.

23:15.369 --> 23:17.337
I know you're in pain.

23:17.405 --> 23:20.473
And I know how hard
it's been.

23:21.926 --> 23:24.411
But it will get better,
you'll see.

23:24.445 --> 23:27.714
We just need
to stick together.

23:27.765 --> 23:30.500
I adore you, margaret.

23:30.518 --> 23:32.886
I adore our family.

23:32.937 --> 23:38.725
<i>My entire universe--</i>
<i>it's within these walls.</i>

23:38.776 --> 23:41.811
The rest can disappear.

23:47.151 --> 23:50.870
And if I were
to believe all that?

23:54.492 --> 23:56.743
I need you to marry me.

23:57.995 --> 24:01.364
- Need?
- <i>So you won't</i>
<i>have to testify.</i>

24:02.883 --> 24:06.669
- I <i>want</i> you to marry me.
- Why did you not say that?

24:06.703 --> 24:09.089
Because I didn't
want to insult you

24:09.140 --> 24:12.342
By pretending
that you wouldn't be
saving my life.

24:13.894 --> 24:16.529
<i>I've done bad things--</i>

24:16.564 --> 24:18.214
Horrible things

24:18.232 --> 24:22.185
That I convinced myself
were justified.

24:25.856 --> 24:28.074
I can see how wrong
that was

24:28.109 --> 24:31.444
<i>And god or no god,</i>

24:31.479 --> 24:35.281
- <i>No one is sorrier than I am.</i>
- <i>( kettle whistling )</i>

24:35.332 --> 24:38.501
I'm afraid, margaret.

24:40.204 --> 24:43.373
I don't want to die
or spend the rest of
my life in jail.

24:44.658 --> 24:48.261
<i>I'd never admit that</i>
<i>to anyone but you.</i>

24:57.972 --> 25:00.756
You are always
surprising.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.645
- I will grant you that.
- ( whistling stops )

25:07.598 --> 25:10.283
<i>( music playing )</i>

25:12.769 --> 25:14.704
The death certificate's
been approved.

25:14.738 --> 25:16.623
You should keep a copy
for your files.

25:19.776 --> 25:22.996
"cause of death:
Accident."

25:23.047 --> 25:25.498
That cost a pretty penny.

25:25.549 --> 25:28.384
There's also the question
of his will.

25:28.419 --> 25:30.336
I didn't realize
he had one.

25:30.387 --> 25:33.306
From 1914.
He never revised it.

25:33.340 --> 25:35.558
And?

25:39.730 --> 25:42.632
He left the bulk of his estate
to a louanne pratt.

25:45.819 --> 25:48.321
His servant...

25:48.355 --> 25:50.773
Who tried
to poison him.

25:50.807 --> 25:54.310
- What if he had no will?
- His estate goes to you,
as next of kin.

25:54.328 --> 25:56.312
And from me
to my son--

25:56.363 --> 25:58.448
- When I die.
- Heaven forbid.

26:10.261 --> 26:13.329
Sir?
Your guests have arrived.

26:15.666 --> 26:18.601
Be firm in what you want.
You need to make sure
that they--

26:18.636 --> 26:21.521
Ma.
No more advice.

26:21.555 --> 26:23.556
I've only tried
to help you.

26:23.607 --> 26:25.725
- I never meant for any--
- I know you did.

26:28.028 --> 26:30.230
You're the man
of the house.

26:31.699 --> 26:33.733
- All: Ma'am.
- Gentlemen.

26:34.952 --> 26:37.203
Jimmy.

26:37.238 --> 26:38.888
( groans )

26:38.956 --> 26:41.241
Obviously, with my
father's passing,

26:41.292 --> 26:42.992
Things have changed
quite a bit.

26:43.026 --> 26:45.795
I'm talking to the mayor
about naming a street
for him.

26:45.829 --> 26:48.030
- My condolences.
- On your wife as well, jim.

26:48.048 --> 26:50.300
Thank you.

26:50.334 --> 26:52.552
I've rethought
our position

26:52.586 --> 26:54.037
Regarding nucky.

26:54.071 --> 26:57.090
His ass in a sling
seems like the right
position to me.

26:57.141 --> 27:00.059
- ( chuckles )
- we're going after eli.

27:00.094 --> 27:02.312
You'll recant
your testimony,

27:02.346 --> 27:04.681
- All of you,
blame everything on him.
- What?

27:04.715 --> 27:06.766
- After all this?!
- My reputation's on the line.

27:06.817 --> 27:08.651
And if nucky beats
the charges,

27:08.686 --> 27:10.553
Where's
your reputation then?

27:10.571 --> 27:12.555
He's on the ropes, kid,
on the run.

27:12.573 --> 27:14.607
This is no time
to lose confidence.

27:14.658 --> 27:16.559
What do you think,
leander?

27:17.611 --> 27:19.779
My advice is
to stay the course.

27:19.830 --> 27:22.448
You been through
the wringer, kid.

27:22.499 --> 27:24.284
Your wife,
now your pop--

27:24.335 --> 27:25.952
That's a burden
for any man.

27:26.003 --> 27:28.237
Boyd:
<i>Take a trip,</i>
<i>clear your mind.</i>

27:28.255 --> 27:30.072
<i>A week from now,</i>
<i>this will all be over.</i>

27:30.090 --> 27:32.508
Ryan:
<i>We've come this far,</i>
<i>why turn back?</i>

27:32.543 --> 27:35.461
Neary:
<i>Besides, I like</i>
<i>being the treasurer.</i>

27:35.512 --> 27:37.630
( laughter )

27:41.018 --> 27:43.269
- Nucky: <i>Is your name</i>
<i>emily schroeder?</i>
- Emily: <i>Yes.</i>

27:43.304 --> 27:45.805
- <i>Are you the strongest</i>
<i>little girl in the world?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

27:45.856 --> 27:49.025
- <i>Are you the strongest</i>
<i>mightiest--</i>
- <i>yes.</i>

27:49.059 --> 27:51.927
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>--Strongest girl</i>
<i>in the world?</i>

27:51.945 --> 27:53.730
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Can you walk to daddy?</i>

27:53.764 --> 27:55.698
- Teddy: <i>You can do it.</i>
- Nucky: <i>Keep your legs still.</i>

27:55.733 --> 27:58.234
- <i>Now put your crutch out.</i>
- Teddy: <i>Start with</i>
<i>your right foot.</i>

27:58.268 --> 28:00.770
Nucky:
<i>Just your-- now take a step.</i>
<i>Now do the other crutch.</i>

28:00.788 --> 28:03.039
- <i>Now take a step.</i>
- Teddy: <i>That's great!</i>

28:03.073 --> 28:04.991
There you go.
Just like that, see?

28:05.042 --> 28:07.610
- Come on, sweetie,
you can do it.
- You can do it!

28:07.628 --> 28:09.162
Good.  Just like that.
Crutch...

28:09.213 --> 28:11.497
- That's it.  Walk to daddy!
- ...Then step.  Crutch...

28:11.548 --> 28:13.549
- Teddy: <i>Come on!</i>
- <i>...Step.  You're doing it!</i>

28:13.617 --> 28:15.885
- <i>Emily, you can do it!</i>
- Nucky: <i>Are you as strong</i>
<i>as your big brother?</i>

28:15.919 --> 28:17.837
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Come on, emily.</i>
<i>You can do it.</i>

28:17.888 --> 28:20.757
- <i>Come on, emily,</i>
<i>you can do it.</i>
- <i>Oh, there you go, come on.</i>

28:20.791 --> 28:22.091
<i>Come on.</i>

28:24.144 --> 28:28.514
- ( silverware clanks )
- thank you.

28:28.565 --> 28:31.434
I would like you to come
with me, please.

28:31.468 --> 28:34.821
- Where?
- Mr. Sleater will
drive us to the church,

28:34.855 --> 28:37.907
Where I intend to make a full
and complete confession.

28:39.410 --> 28:41.944
Then after I've made
my peace with god,

28:41.978 --> 28:44.313
Father brennan
will marry us.

28:50.153 --> 28:53.823
- Thank you.
I don't know what's--
- children?

28:53.841 --> 28:56.876
We'll be back later.
Say goodbye to your father.

28:56.927 --> 28:59.295
- Bye.
- Bye, daddy.

29:01.048 --> 29:02.832
Emily:
<i>Would you like some more?</i>

29:02.850 --> 29:07.503
Katy, I need you
to come with us,
please.

29:07.554 --> 29:09.856
<i>( piano playing )</i>

29:12.693 --> 29:15.611
May it please the court,

29:15.646 --> 29:17.947
Gentlemen of the jury,

29:17.981 --> 29:19.816
My name is
esther randolph,

29:19.850 --> 29:22.201
Assistant
United States attorney.

29:25.689 --> 29:28.691
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

29:28.709 --> 29:30.626
During the course
of this trial,

29:30.661 --> 29:32.712
You'll hear
a great many charges

29:32.746 --> 29:34.914
Brought against
enoch thompson.

29:34.965 --> 29:37.133
First and foremost,

29:37.167 --> 29:40.253
<i>That he ordered the murder</i>
<i>of a mr. Hans schroeder,</i>

29:40.304 --> 29:43.055
<i>A romantic rival.</i>

29:43.090 --> 29:46.342
Using his influence as
treasurer of atlantic county,

29:46.376 --> 29:51.230
Mr. Thompson also engaged
in other violations
of the law,

29:51.265 --> 29:53.900
<i>Enlisting his underlings</i>
<i>in graft,</i>

29:53.934 --> 29:56.886
<i>Violations</i>
<i>of the volstead act</i>

29:56.937 --> 30:00.690
<i>And extortion</i>
<i>of local businesses.</i>

30:07.948 --> 30:10.583
<i>Enoch thompson is a man</i>
<i>who will stop at nothing</i>

30:10.617 --> 30:13.169
<i>To achieve his ends,</i>

30:13.203 --> 30:16.205
<i>A man whose greed</i>
<i>knows no boundaries.</i>

30:16.239 --> 30:19.625
Brennan:
<i>Let women be subject to their</i>
<i>husbands as to the lord,</i>

30:19.676 --> 30:21.577
<i>For the husband</i>
<i>is the hand...</i>

30:21.595 --> 30:25.014
Randolph:
<i>You'll hear how rather than</i>
<i>minding the city's coffers,</i>

30:25.048 --> 30:28.050
He was instead
lining his own pockets.

30:28.084 --> 30:31.521
Brennan:
<i>Therefore, as the church</i>
<i>is subject to christ,</i>

30:31.555 --> 30:35.475
<i>So also let the wives be</i>
<i>to their husbands</i>
<i>in all things.</i>

30:35.526 --> 30:37.059
- ( moaning )
- ( phone ringing )

30:37.093 --> 30:39.529
Randolph:
<i>Along with his</i>
<i>various aldermen,</i>

30:39.563 --> 30:42.565
<i>He has plundered the citizens</i>
<i>of atlantic county,</i>

30:42.599 --> 30:45.067
<i>Using the spoils</i>
<i>to ensure his position</i>

30:45.101 --> 30:47.370
<i>By rigging</i>
<i>last year's election.</i>

30:47.404 --> 30:50.072
You'll hear directly
from some of these aldermen,

30:50.106 --> 30:52.658
Including james neary,

30:52.709 --> 30:54.777
Now the interim treasurer.

30:54.795 --> 30:57.129
- <i>( moaning )</i>
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>

30:57.164 --> 30:59.298
Oh god.
What the fuck?

30:59.333 --> 31:01.884
- <i>( door slams )</i>
- look at me.

31:01.919 --> 31:04.470
Take a coffee break,
don't come back.

31:04.505 --> 31:08.007
Marriage is an institution
not to be taken lightly...

31:08.058 --> 31:11.177
Enoch thompson is a man
loyal only to himself.

31:11.228 --> 31:13.629
Brennan:
<i>...A sacred covenant</i>
<i>before god.</i>

31:13.647 --> 31:16.799
A man who orders up murder
like you and I order coffee.

31:16.817 --> 31:19.435
Knowing this,
I ask you,

31:19.469 --> 31:23.105
Do you, margaret,
choose to marry enoch,

31:23.139 --> 31:25.358
To join with him
as your husband,

31:25.409 --> 31:29.028
- <i>For all the days</i>
<i>of your life?</i>
- I do.

31:29.079 --> 31:30.997
Jimmy:
<i>"...At which point</i>

31:31.031 --> 31:34.984
Sheriff elias thompson

31:35.002 --> 31:38.704
Ordered me to falsify

31:38.755 --> 31:40.540
<i>Voting records..."</i>

31:40.591 --> 31:42.825
I, enoch,
take you, margaret,

31:42.843 --> 31:44.844
For my lawful wife.

31:46.663 --> 31:48.831
- Sign it.
- Nice, fellas.

31:48.849 --> 31:51.166
A fucking confession
signed at gunpoint.

31:51.184 --> 31:52.635
It's not just
a confession.

31:52.669 --> 31:55.221
- ( gags )
- richard: It was
a suicide note.

31:56.273 --> 31:58.307
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>

32:04.948 --> 32:08.534
Accordingly, there can be
only one just verdict--

32:08.569 --> 32:10.903
Guilty.

32:13.707 --> 32:16.042
<i>( woman shrieking )</i>

32:20.581 --> 32:22.298
<i>( gavel pounds )</i>

32:22.332 --> 32:23.883
Order!

32:23.917 --> 32:25.668
- Order!
- ( murmuring )

32:28.538 --> 32:31.557
A last-minute marriage,
an alleged suicide,

32:31.592 --> 32:34.727
Sudden recantations
of sworn testimony.

32:34.761 --> 32:36.312
In my eight years
as a prosecutor,

32:36.346 --> 32:38.931
I have never seen
a more blatant example
of witness tampering.

32:39.016 --> 32:41.567
Objection!  I resent these
insinuations, your honor.

32:41.602 --> 32:44.570
Insinuations?
They're flat-out
accusations!

32:44.605 --> 32:47.356
Simply because
miss randolph's case
is unraveling

32:47.390 --> 32:49.525
- <i>Like a ball</i>
<i>of yarn, I don't--</i>
- spare me, mr. Fallon.

32:49.559 --> 32:50.893
We all know what's
going on here.

32:50.911 --> 32:52.445
Until you can prove it,
I suggest--

32:52.496 --> 32:53.829
- ( gavel bangs )
- order!

32:53.864 --> 32:55.564
Counsel, approach bench.

33:01.738 --> 33:03.623
You have no chance
at a murder conviction

33:03.674 --> 33:06.042
And you've lost
your main witness
on the other charges.

33:06.093 --> 33:08.628
<i>Do you really want</i>
<i>to proceed with this fiasco</i>

33:08.712 --> 33:10.763
Until jeopardy attaches?

33:10.797 --> 33:13.799
Or would you rather go
get your ducks in a row?

33:14.801 --> 33:16.752
She who fights
and runs away...

33:18.855 --> 33:20.756
I'll take the ducks,
your honor.

33:21.942 --> 33:23.809
The defense motion
for a mistrial is granted.

33:23.860 --> 33:27.029
- This case is dismissed
without prejudice.
- ( clamoring )

33:32.069 --> 33:34.603
Your honor,
I move that my client

33:34.621 --> 33:37.823
Sheriff elias thompson
be released on his own
recognizance.

33:37.908 --> 33:39.108
<i>Granted.</i>

33:41.628 --> 33:44.380
I make the same motion
for my client deputy
raymond halloran.

33:44.414 --> 33:47.416
<i>Your client</i>
<i>confessed to murdering</i>
<i>hans schroeder.</i>

33:47.450 --> 33:48.968
We had a plea deal,
your honor.

33:49.002 --> 33:51.637
Then I suggest you read it.
It was conditioned on the fact

33:51.672 --> 33:54.223
That mr. Thompson's
murder charge goes
to the jury.

33:54.257 --> 33:56.058
Mr. Halloran, you are
hereby remanded

33:56.093 --> 33:58.310
<i>To the federal penitentiary</i>
<i>at leavenworth, kansas.</i>

33:58.345 --> 34:00.796
What?
Wait a minute!

34:00.814 --> 34:02.515
I don't understand!

34:02.566 --> 34:05.634
- <i>No!  No!</i>
- Reporters: Nucky, nucky!

34:05.652 --> 34:07.903
- Mr. Thompson!
- A few words, mr. Thompson?

34:07.938 --> 34:10.523
- How do you feel right now?
- ( all shouting )

34:11.625 --> 34:14.860
<i>( fiddle playing )</i>

34:16.697 --> 34:19.982
( kids laughing )

34:23.704 --> 34:27.489
- Boy: Mommy, look!
- Jimmy: What about this pony?

34:28.875 --> 34:30.876
He's looking
to make friends.

34:30.927 --> 34:32.661
Tsk tsk tsk.
Here you go.

34:32.679 --> 34:35.880
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

34:37.167 --> 34:39.217
All right, hold it
flat out in your palm,

34:39.268 --> 34:42.221
Just like that.
Just like that.

34:45.175 --> 34:47.193
Pretty wet, huh?

34:49.362 --> 34:52.782
He wants you to pet him.

34:54.985 --> 34:56.851
He likes that.

34:56.870 --> 34:59.155
He's a gentle
little one.

35:01.041 --> 35:04.076
You know, when I was your age,
a little bit older,

35:04.127 --> 35:07.880
And it was hot like this,
I'd head out here.

35:09.166 --> 35:11.884
The boardwalk didn't
come out this far then.

35:11.918 --> 35:14.470
I'd build a lean-to
out of driftwood.

35:14.537 --> 35:16.555
A pocketful of peanuts

35:16.590 --> 35:19.208
And pretend I was
robinson crusoe.

35:19.226 --> 35:21.877
With mima?

35:26.183 --> 35:29.185
No, mima didn't know
where I was.

35:29.219 --> 35:31.386
Nobody did.

35:31.404 --> 35:34.490
It was just
me, myself and I.

35:34.524 --> 35:37.777
Can I do that?

35:37.828 --> 35:40.162
Sure.

35:40.197 --> 35:42.281
All right, here we go.

35:42.332 --> 35:44.366
Whoa!

35:44.400 --> 35:45.785
( grunts )

35:47.070 --> 35:50.673
Hands here, hold on
with your legs.

35:50.707 --> 35:52.508
Tighter.

35:52.542 --> 35:55.010
It won't bother him.

35:55.045 --> 35:56.896
Cowboy or soldier?

35:56.963 --> 35:59.081
Soldier.

36:02.585 --> 36:05.771
You pay me after.

36:14.014 --> 36:16.816
Jimmy:
Hold on, buddy.

36:19.286 --> 36:22.404
<i>( music continues )</i>

36:53.469 --> 36:55.821
You're awake.

36:55.906 --> 36:58.023
And I'm drunk.

37:01.411 --> 37:03.779
Not the most romantic
greeting, was it?

37:03.813 --> 37:05.948
Honesty
has its virtues.

37:05.982 --> 37:08.284
I was out celebrating
with fallon.

37:08.318 --> 37:11.486
Yes, congratulations.

37:11.504 --> 37:14.089
<i>A stroke of luck.</i>

37:14.124 --> 37:16.959
- I know what
you're thinking.
- <i>Really?</i>

37:16.993 --> 37:18.660
What's that?

37:18.678 --> 37:21.597
The mistrial,

37:21.631 --> 37:24.850
I had nothing to do
with neary's suicide,
margaret.

37:24.885 --> 37:27.219
I believe you.

37:27.270 --> 37:29.722
Look, I'd be lying
if I said it didn't
benefit me.

37:29.773 --> 37:33.459
Obviously it did.
But he was a very
troubled man,

37:33.493 --> 37:36.478
<i>Involved in something</i>
<i>he knew was wrong.</i>

37:39.566 --> 37:42.868
I can't be responsible
for all the misfortune
in the world, can I?

37:42.903 --> 37:46.188
I said I believe you.

37:50.193 --> 37:53.045
Have you seen
the evening paper?

37:55.365 --> 37:58.334
Congress is set to approve
the road appropriations.

37:58.368 --> 38:01.086
10 million
for new jersey.

38:01.137 --> 38:04.506
- A good day for the state.
- A good day for us.

38:04.540 --> 38:07.726
That land will be worth
a fortune, mrs. Thompson.

38:07.761 --> 38:10.179
So you've said.

38:10.213 --> 38:13.315
I'll need you to sign
the deed back over soon
as you get a chance.

38:13.350 --> 38:16.885
Of course.
It was only for safekeeping.

38:19.656 --> 38:21.490
Am I sleeping in here?

38:21.524 --> 38:24.559
We <i>are</i> married.

38:25.996 --> 38:28.414
Who knows?
Maybe you're right.

38:31.952 --> 38:35.404
Maybe god <i>is</i> giving me
another chance.

38:39.626 --> 38:41.877
( laughing )

38:48.418 --> 38:50.769
<i>( car approaching )</i>

39:09.606 --> 39:12.791
- Hey, uncle nucky!
- Brian.  Getting big.

39:12.826 --> 39:15.160
Dermott.

39:26.139 --> 39:28.090
Help yourself.

39:30.343 --> 39:32.478
A little early, isn't it?

39:32.512 --> 39:34.930
My own recognizance.

39:34.964 --> 39:37.683
It means
I make the rules.

39:46.076 --> 39:47.776
( exhales )

39:53.450 --> 39:56.418
- Hot enough for you?
- Yes.

39:56.453 --> 40:00.205
And how about those phillies?
And my brother tried
to have me killed.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.928
<i>Et tu,</i> eli?

40:05.962 --> 40:07.796
What?

40:07.830 --> 40:10.832
Shakespeare.
"julius caesar."

40:14.537 --> 40:17.773
There's a character
named eli?

40:27.283 --> 40:30.519
I told you I had
nothing to do with that.

40:30.570 --> 40:32.571
The shooting.

40:32.605 --> 40:34.540
That's not what
your partner said.

40:34.574 --> 40:36.959
- My partner?
- Jimmy.

40:36.993 --> 40:39.578
What do you expect, nucky?

40:39.629 --> 40:41.547
That fucking kid'll lie
about anything.

40:41.581 --> 40:45.700
After all this,
will you at least do me
the courtesy of being honest?

40:45.718 --> 40:47.803
I am being honest.

40:48.838 --> 40:51.223
I tried to stop them.

40:51.257 --> 40:53.675
They threatened me--

40:53.709 --> 40:56.762
My life,
my livelihood.

40:56.813 --> 40:59.515
No-- I came to you, nucky.

40:59.549 --> 41:01.850
You forget?

41:01.884 --> 41:03.485
<i>Hat in hand?</i>

41:03.520 --> 41:06.605
- And you pissed on me.
- ( kids yelling )

41:06.656 --> 41:08.657
Hey!

41:08.691 --> 41:10.659
You rip those pants,
you'll be sorry!

41:10.693 --> 41:12.911
What?

41:17.834 --> 41:19.568
You'll plead guilty.

41:19.586 --> 41:21.253
Woman: Dexter!

41:21.337 --> 41:23.372
- What?
- To everything--

41:23.406 --> 41:26.074
All of it, before they bring
new charges.

41:26.092 --> 41:28.927
- Nucky, that's--
- <i>I spoke to the</i>
<i>attorney general.</i>

41:28.962 --> 41:31.046
You'll do two years
at the most,

41:31.080 --> 41:33.715
Be out in half that time.

41:34.917 --> 41:36.885
- <i>June, the kids...</i>
- ( sighs )

41:36.919 --> 41:39.454
<i>...They'll be well</i>
<i>looked after.</i>

41:39.489 --> 41:42.357
It's the best
you're going to do, eli.

41:42.392 --> 41:45.093
God knows
it could be a lot worse.

41:53.820 --> 41:55.937
( sighs )

42:04.130 --> 42:06.315
I'd understood
it was brown.

42:06.349 --> 42:09.251
Some is.
There's all
different types.

42:09.285 --> 42:11.470
It should be gold,
you ask me.

42:11.504 --> 42:14.956
They try it once,
you've got a customer
for life.

42:16.342 --> 42:19.061
And your supplier?

42:19.128 --> 42:21.146
Some chink downtown.

42:21.181 --> 42:23.565
Ship it in
from the orient.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.134
We could start
an import operation--

42:26.152 --> 42:27.969
<i>( phone rings )</i>

42:27.987 --> 42:31.690
Chinese lanterns,
things of that nature.

42:31.741 --> 42:33.442
Cut out the middleman.

42:33.476 --> 42:36.662
Just so you know, we come
to you with this first.

42:36.696 --> 42:38.797
Out of respect.

Nucky thompson calling.

42:50.927 --> 42:53.995
Mr. Thompson,
congratulations.

42:54.013 --> 42:56.265
I hear mr. Fallon
earned his fee.

42:56.299 --> 42:58.800
- Well, I'm sure
he thinks he did.
- <i>( rothstein chuckles )</i>

42:58.834 --> 43:02.688
- <i>What can I do for you?</i>
- Manny horvitz.

43:02.722 --> 43:05.724
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>I've heard the name.</i>

43:05.775 --> 43:08.843
And if he were suddenly
to be among the departed?

43:08.861 --> 43:12.264
- Why do you ask?
- <i>As a courtesy.</i>

43:12.298 --> 43:15.284
<i>He has a connection</i>
<i>to waxey gordon,</i>

43:15.318 --> 43:17.319
<i>Who I know has</i>
<i>a connection to you.</i>

43:18.371 --> 43:20.322
If mr. Horvitz

43:20.356 --> 43:22.157
Were to go?

43:23.376 --> 43:25.527
( softly )
who gives a shit?

43:27.080 --> 43:29.248
I would have no opinion

43:29.299 --> 43:31.466
One way or the other.

43:33.419 --> 43:35.537
Well then,

43:35.555 --> 43:38.540
It appears <i>I</i> have
a decision to make.

43:38.558 --> 43:40.726
<i>Flip a coin.</i>

43:40.760 --> 43:44.563
When it's in the air,
you'll know which side
you're hoping for.

43:52.405 --> 43:53.939
( exhales )

43:55.224 --> 43:57.826
...With the greengrocer
right up the street.

43:57.860 --> 44:00.746
And, uh, if you're
churchgoing people--?

44:00.780 --> 44:02.414
Van alden:
We are.

44:02.448 --> 44:05.250
St. Mary of czestochowa
is nearby.

44:07.370 --> 44:09.204
Very nice.

44:09.238 --> 44:11.290
It's a quiet town
for quiet people,

44:11.341 --> 44:13.458
Like most
of the midwest.

44:15.595 --> 44:17.963
I'm sure we'll be
quite happy here.

44:18.014 --> 44:20.048
As am I.

44:27.607 --> 44:29.891
That's the first
two months in advance.

44:29.925 --> 44:33.428
Mr. And mrs. Mueller,
welcome to cicero.

44:38.100 --> 44:40.569
<i>( music playing )</i>

44:42.322 --> 44:44.939
- Jimmy: ...So
the whole company...
- Gillian: Ow!

44:44.957 --> 44:46.491
...Is supposed
to be singing.

44:46.542 --> 44:49.628
And this fella radcliff,

44:49.662 --> 44:52.748
( laughing )
he starts changing
the words.

44:54.167 --> 44:56.785
¶ over there ¶

44:56.803 --> 44:58.953
¶ fuck a bear ¶

44:58.971 --> 45:01.923
¶ I'll fight any night
in my underwear. ¶

45:03.843 --> 45:06.461
You know,

45:06.479 --> 45:08.963
I'd be out days on end,

45:08.981 --> 45:12.467
Moving from blind
to blind.

45:12.485 --> 45:17.522
Water, rations, rifle--

45:17.573 --> 45:20.742
Never speak a word.

45:21.694 --> 45:23.645
I'd come back to camp

45:23.663 --> 45:26.998
And the boys joking...

45:28.785 --> 45:31.286
And I'd feel...

45:32.205 --> 45:34.289
This is where

45:34.323 --> 45:35.657
I'm meant to be.

45:35.675 --> 45:39.094
- ( snorts )
- nobody was meant
to be there.

45:39.128 --> 45:41.680
But that's where
we were.

45:45.301 --> 45:48.670
And we're still there,
aren't we?

45:48.688 --> 45:50.672
Tommy:
<i>One, two, three, go!</i>

45:50.690 --> 45:53.392
Time to come home,
richard.

45:54.310 --> 45:56.228
How?

45:56.279 --> 45:59.564
I don't know.
But promise me
you're gonna try.

45:59.615 --> 46:02.984
- Tommy: <i>Okay, go go go!</i>
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>

46:04.687 --> 46:07.038
( humming )

46:12.078 --> 46:14.913
- Hello.
- Nucky: <i>It's me.</i>

46:16.215 --> 46:18.667
<i>I've located your friend</i>
<i>mr. Horvitz.</i>

46:19.919 --> 46:22.087
- How?
- <i>Mickey doyle.</i>

46:22.138 --> 46:25.006
<i>Horvitz is meeting me</i>
<i>in one hour.</i>

46:25.040 --> 46:27.092
<i>The war memorial.</i>

46:27.143 --> 46:28.894
<i>( tommy chattering )</i>

46:28.928 --> 46:31.313
I'll be there.

46:40.189 --> 46:42.274
- Who was that?
- Nucky.

46:42.325 --> 46:44.058
He found manny horvitz.

46:44.076 --> 46:46.161
I'll come with you.

46:46.195 --> 46:49.114
It's okay.

46:49.165 --> 46:52.834
Tommy:
<i>Okay, I'm gonna have</i>
<i>all the horses now.</i>

46:52.869 --> 46:55.921
I could take care
of this for you.

46:57.957 --> 47:00.742
This is something
I gotta do myself.

47:04.580 --> 47:07.248
<i>( toy clatters )</i>

47:11.137 --> 47:13.522
How about putting
this guy in the car?

47:13.556 --> 47:16.942
Tommy:
<i>We're gonna have a fight</i>
<i>with the cowboys in the car.</i>

47:16.976 --> 47:20.612
- Gillian: <i>Ohhh.  You can</i>
<i>do whatever you want.</i>
- <i>( door closes )</i>

47:20.646 --> 47:23.732
- <i>( thunder rumbles )</i>
- yeah!

47:23.766 --> 47:25.901
Did jimmy go out?

47:29.271 --> 47:31.573
Yes.

47:36.746 --> 47:39.214
Something he has to do.

47:47.423 --> 47:49.758
Come on, you.
Upstairs.

47:51.394 --> 47:53.979
What are you wearing
under there?

47:56.465 --> 47:58.650
So they can always tell
who you are.

47:58.684 --> 48:01.486
Did daddy
give you those?

48:07.994 --> 48:10.495
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

48:11.914 --> 48:13.815
- You know what?
- What?

48:13.833 --> 48:17.752
You're going
to be a big man
in this city one day.

48:19.088 --> 48:21.006
Just like
your father.

48:46.065 --> 48:48.567
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

49:13.059 --> 49:15.093
James.

49:21.601 --> 49:24.686
So now you will have
your revenge, boychik.

49:28.390 --> 49:30.158
Is that what this is?

49:30.225 --> 49:32.077
( shotgun cocks )

49:57.770 --> 50:00.188
His boot.

50:03.442 --> 50:06.111
I'm not armed.

50:06.145 --> 50:08.113
He isn't.

50:14.820 --> 50:17.572
This is the only way
we could have ended,

50:17.606 --> 50:19.273
Isn't it?

50:19.291 --> 50:21.710
This is your choice, james.

50:23.663 --> 50:25.747
I died in the trench,

50:25.781 --> 50:27.298
Years back.

50:27.333 --> 50:30.335
I thought
you knew that.

50:34.140 --> 50:36.290
So who's going to do it?

50:37.977 --> 50:40.128
Manny?

50:41.597 --> 50:43.732
You?

50:46.936 --> 50:49.303
Eli?

50:49.321 --> 50:52.140
I am.

51:09.458 --> 51:11.926
My first time
I vomited after...

51:14.964 --> 51:16.931
Two days straight.

51:16.966 --> 51:18.767
Second time I didn't
even think about it.

51:18.801 --> 51:21.502
- So fucking stupid.
- Just try to make
yourself calm.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.838
- You had everything going...
- Breathe, nuck.

51:23.856 --> 51:25.006
...Your whole life.

51:25.858 --> 51:27.842
You'll get through it.

51:27.860 --> 51:29.644
All you got
to worry about is when

51:29.678 --> 51:31.696
You run out of booze

51:31.731 --> 51:34.348
And you run out
of company

51:34.366 --> 51:36.684
And the only person
left to judge you
is your--

51:49.298 --> 51:52.634
<i>( jimmy coughing,</i>
<i>gagging )</i>

52:01.977 --> 52:04.429
You don't know me, james.

52:05.765 --> 52:07.548
You never did.

52:10.052 --> 52:11.552
I...

52:11.570 --> 52:13.221
Am not

52:13.239 --> 52:15.356
Seeking

52:15.390 --> 52:16.941
Forgiveness.

52:38.931 --> 52:42.717
<i>( choir vocalizing )</i>

52:43.919 --> 52:47.071
<i>( mortar whistling )</i>

53:01.937 --> 53:04.205

53:13.299 --> 53:15.950
<i>( whistle tooting )</i>

53:15.968 --> 53:18.670
Man: <i>Advance!</i>

53:36.972 --> 53:40.191
It was only the angels
bowling up in heaven, dear.

53:40.242 --> 53:42.861
Nothing at all
to be afraid of.

53:45.164 --> 53:46.447
Good morning.

53:46.481 --> 53:48.333
Good morning.

53:50.669 --> 53:52.704
Are you not having
breakfast?

53:52.755 --> 53:54.655
Early meeting.

53:55.824 --> 53:57.491
You were late
last night.

53:57.509 --> 54:00.011
I was beginning
to get worried.

54:00.045 --> 54:02.180
No need.

54:02.214 --> 54:03.848
Where were you?

54:03.883 --> 54:05.516
Just out.

54:05.551 --> 54:07.552
In the rain?

54:10.172 --> 54:12.307
I ran into
james darmody.

54:13.442 --> 54:15.443
Really?

54:15.477 --> 54:16.728
And how was that?

54:16.779 --> 54:19.680
It was fine.
We cleared the air.

54:21.901 --> 54:24.235
I'm surprised.

54:24.270 --> 54:26.187
My new leaf.

54:26.205 --> 54:28.522
It turns out
he's reenlisting.

54:28.540 --> 54:30.575
<i>Already left, actually.</i>

54:36.999 --> 54:39.500
<i>Well, the rain broke</i>
<i>the heat at least.</i>

54:39.534 --> 54:42.804
Yes.
It did.

54:46.025 --> 54:47.842
I'll be home
for dinner.

54:51.847 --> 54:53.848
<i>( music playing )</i>

55:19.925 --> 55:22.343

- <i>( horn blares )</i>

55:38.093 --> 55:41.779
- You're in
the middle of the highway!
- Congratulations, nucky.

55:41.864 --> 55:44.115
Gentlemen.

Bader:
<i>Not a minute</i>
<i>too soon.</i>

55:50.873 --> 55:52.940
We're almost out.

55:52.958 --> 55:55.626
- So this is it, eh?
- The road to riches.

55:55.661 --> 55:58.546
I was thinking
the harding highway.

55:58.580 --> 56:01.666
It never hurts to remember
your friends, huh?

56:47.346 --> 56:49.163
Katy?

56:49.181 --> 56:51.349
I need you to drop this
with father brennan.
