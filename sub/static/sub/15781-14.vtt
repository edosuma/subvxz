16:11.203 --> 16:13.832
the jerk who made The Rusty
join Match.com.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.932
He's got to at least
try to get some loving.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.704
And the one with the umbrella
is Thanatos,

16:17.776 --> 16:21.008
the jerk who made
The Rusty <i>quit</i> Match.com.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.811
Hey, many of these women could
be murderous gold diggers,

16:23.882 --> 16:26.010
or, at the very least,
carriers of chlamydia.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.553
You want me to help
these two?

16:27.619 --> 16:28.484
They're my biggest problem.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.182
And those rotten things.

16:30.255 --> 16:31.848
Scat! Shoo!

16:31.924 --> 16:33.756
Whoever you are, get out.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.523
We want only
passage to master control

16:36.595 --> 16:37.995
to save The Rusty.

16:38.063 --> 16:40.294
He has been taken over
by an intruder.

16:40.366 --> 16:43.131
If you help us,
we are at your bidding.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.262
Oh, you want to get
to the next level?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.635
Okay. Help me fix <i>this.</i>

16:49.375 --> 16:51.970
The guy was all but crawling
already, mind you,

16:52.044 --> 16:54.070
but the boy
was still able to squeeze off

16:54.146 --> 16:55.011
two good leg shots.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.048
Hank did that?

16:56.115 --> 16:59.176
Yeah, for a...Hank,
he's not a bad shot.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.651
Thanks to me.

17:00.719 --> 17:02.381
You guys!
Dean's hurt or something!

17:02.454 --> 17:04.548
He's running around the yard
screaming!

17:04.623 --> 17:05.886
Come on!

17:05.958 --> 17:07.221
I'll deal with this.

17:07.291 --> 17:10.922
Hell no!
<i>I'll</i> deal with this.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.925
Why are you not
insane yet?!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.525
What does it take?!

17:16.602 --> 17:18.366
[sighs ]

17:18.436 --> 17:20.497
It is getting hot
in here.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.200
[ flatline]

17:22.273 --> 17:23.970
[slurring ]
And then he just ran away

17:24.042 --> 17:26.273
and I'm standing there
for like three hours

17:26.345 --> 17:27.836
before I just left.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.040
[slurring ]
Did you ever think, like,

17:29.114 --> 17:30.104
maybe you
could do better?

17:30.182 --> 17:31.172
I dunno.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.843
Can you do better
than a man you adore

17:32.918 --> 17:34.853
and who really needs you?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.684
Well, maybe like a man
who needs you

17:36.755 --> 17:39.919
and would treat you like
the amazing woman you are --

17:39.992 --> 17:41.324
like a perfect beauty
center

17:41.393 --> 17:45.125
with a coating made of
perfect-smart candy.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.495
Someone like that.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.500
Oh, come on. That's silly.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.195
Like who?

17:50.269 --> 17:52.329
Oh, maybe like...

17:52.404 --> 17:56.034
like me.

17:56.108 --> 17:59.101
I-I-It just keeps
falling apart.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.407
Where's the Dracula guy?

18:00.479 --> 18:01.708
How do you know that guy?

18:01.780 --> 18:02.907
Just showed up.

18:02.981 --> 18:04.711
Hey, don't you have any glue
or something?

18:04.783 --> 18:05.944
I'm back!

18:06.018 --> 18:07.384
And I've brought help.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.421
Who are they?

18:08.487 --> 18:10.456
They are here to
assist your labors.

18:10.522 --> 18:11.922
You must believe me.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.721
They can help mend
your little boy.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.694
Yeah? Okay.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.731
Then you may pass.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.698
[all gasp]

18:20.766 --> 18:22.667
Dude, how did you
get those from the Id?

18:22.734 --> 18:24.896
I beg you not to ask.

18:24.970 --> 18:26.370
Aah! Oh! Get them off!

18:26.438 --> 18:28.339
Oh, please! Oh, my gosh!

18:28.407 --> 18:29.807
What's going on?!

18:29.875 --> 18:30.968
Don't look at me.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.944
Hank and I are just
tossing the ball around,

18:33.011 --> 18:34.912
then this guy
starts running around like that.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.710
Take it easy, Dean.
What happened?

18:36.782 --> 18:37.909
I don't know!

18:37.983 --> 18:39.007
Just make it stop!

18:39.084 --> 18:40.108
It's burning!

18:40.185 --> 18:42.586
Hello! Here's your problem.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.249
Genius here has a whole ant
colony on his ass.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.292
Oh, geez, Dean.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.418
You sat in the black dirt,
didn't you?

18:48.494 --> 18:50.019
And solved.

18:50.095 --> 18:51.188
Okay, who's up for another game?

18:51.263 --> 18:52.754
What was that?!

18:52.831 --> 18:55.596
Oh, relax. It's just Sprite.

18:55.667 --> 18:59.104
Sprite?! That's sugar!
They eat that.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.833
You just fed the ants.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.841
Aaaaah!

19:02.908 --> 19:04.069
Am I going through
menopause,

19:04.143 --> 19:05.611
or is it getting
really hot in here?

19:05.677 --> 19:07.646
The Rusty is
dying.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.681
We may be too late!

19:08.747 --> 19:10.340
The Rusty is dying?

19:10.415 --> 19:11.781
And you came for <i>my</i> help?

19:11.850 --> 19:14.183
Well, aren't you
the super ego?

19:14.253 --> 19:15.152
[ chuckles ]

19:15.220 --> 19:16.882
Of course, good man.
It's just...

19:16.955 --> 19:18.446
...it's just that
I haven't been called upon

19:18.524 --> 19:19.514
in quite some time.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.957
Then rally!

19:21.026 --> 19:24.190
You are what is strong and true
in The Rusty!

19:24.263 --> 19:25.822
Get us to master control,

19:25.898 --> 19:28.299
and help us
banish the intruder!

19:28.367 --> 19:29.391
That's it?

19:29.468 --> 19:31.528
Easy!

19:31.603 --> 19:33.799
Master control.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.704
That easy.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.710
Whoa! All the doors are open!

19:38.777 --> 19:39.574
That's new.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.204
Well, every door but that one,

19:41.280 --> 19:42.748
and it's the only door
I can't open.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.077
Looks like we're
gonna die.

19:44.149 --> 19:44.980
Knew it.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.916
Is there any
other way in?

19:46.985 --> 19:48.112
Theoretically,
if you could get through

19:48.187 --> 19:50.053
the tragic-memory
ducts,

19:50.122 --> 19:51.215
they lead everywhere.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.417
Capital!

19:52.491 --> 19:54.050
I have an idea.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.561
You will go to the origin
of these ducts,

19:56.628 --> 19:58.153
and you must bring
Eros.

19:58.230 --> 20:02.224
Your strength and his love
will be the bait.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.963
Once you reach the duct,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.334
you two
will combine your...

20:07.639 --> 20:10.370
- Daddy?
- Daddy?

20:10.442 --> 20:13.207
Daddy?

20:13.278 --> 20:15.213
What the?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.374
Aah! Ew! No!

20:17.449 --> 20:18.815
Get the hell away from me!

20:18.884 --> 20:22.480
No! No! No-o-o-o-o!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.853
[ panting ]

20:24.923 --> 20:27.825
W-W-What's going on?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.725
- Nothing.
- Anymore.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.060
Oh, that is humiliating.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.759
Y-Y-You can't just hose him
like a convict.

20:34.833 --> 20:35.994
Oh, will you stop it?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.730
The kid's got ants
on his ass!

20:37.803 --> 20:39.738
This is how you deal
with the problem!

20:39.805 --> 20:41.740
Those boys are not your
problem, Samson!

20:41.807 --> 20:43.241
They're my problem!

20:43.308 --> 20:44.708
You're both
wrong.

20:44.776 --> 20:47.177
Those boys
are <i>my</i> problem.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.874
Brock, turn off the hose.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.348
Dean, get up
and get in the shower.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.907
Hank, stop giggling
at your brother.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.011
Hatred, what the hell is
connected to my chest?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.680
And Shoreleave...

20:56.755 --> 20:59.589
I don't know, go do...
something.

20:59.658 --> 21:03.026
Ugh. I have
a <i>huge</i> headache.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

21:32.491 --> 21:33.584
Are you okay?

21:33.659 --> 21:35.389
Dr. O said you're probably
insane now

21:35.460 --> 21:37.395
and that you'll never
be the same.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.725
[ chuckles ]

21:38.797 --> 21:39.821
Are you kidding?

21:39.898 --> 21:41.332
[sighs ]

21:41.400 --> 21:44.063
Okay, I'm just turning 16

21:44.136 --> 21:46.128
and having a birthday
pool party.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.605
My father invites
every girl he knows,

21:48.674 --> 21:50.666
and I'm not talking about
girls my age.

21:50.742 --> 21:52.176
No, not Jonas.

21:52.244 --> 21:55.180
He invites Playboy Bunnies
and models

21:55.247 --> 21:56.943
and, I think,
actual whores --

21:57.015 --> 21:58.483
you know, real
prostitutes.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.247
So there I am in my giant
bathing suit

22:01.320 --> 22:03.653
with nervous
puberty

22:03.722 --> 22:06.123
oozing out of my
gigantic pores.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.784
Just -- just awful.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.885
So, the band suddenly
stops playing

22:09.961 --> 22:11.452
and I hear

22:11.530 --> 22:15.058
"And now the man of the hour,
Rusty Venture!"

22:15.133 --> 22:17.034
All eyes on me, right?

22:17.102 --> 22:19.333
Then suddenly,
almost predictably,

22:19.404 --> 22:22.431
The Action Man shoots my groin
with a shrink ray

22:22.507 --> 22:24.499
right as that fucking jackass
Colonel Gentleman

22:24.576 --> 22:26.511
pulls
my shorts down.

22:26.578 --> 22:28.774
Wow.
That's like a nightmare.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.281
Oh, no! No!

22:30.349 --> 22:32.944
What I went through today was
"like a nightmare."

22:33.018 --> 22:37.922
What happened when I was 16,
that is my life.
