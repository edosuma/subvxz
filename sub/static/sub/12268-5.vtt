AN INTEREST.

SHE WAS DEAD

00:17.688 --> 00:19.620

STILL ALIVE?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.222

PROTECT YOU.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.237
AMANDA!

01:06.237 --> 01:09.800

REQUIRES ABSOLUTE FORGIVENESS.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.803

PROTECTIVE INSTINCT.

02:12.803 --> 02:15.906
THE REASON I DIDN'T TELL YOU
I'D FOUND KARA

02:15.906 --> 02:19.270
IS BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
SHE COULDN'T HURT YOU.

02:19.270 --> 02:22.913
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

02:25.416 --> 02:30.181
GORDON MURPHY
WASN'T JUST HER SAVIOR.

02:30.181 --> 02:32.152
HE WAS HER HUSBAND.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.624
NO.

02:33.624 --> 02:35.786
SHE TOLD ME HERSELF.

02:35.786 --> 02:37.658
AND AFTER SHE TASED ME
AND LEFT ME TO DIE,

02:37.658 --> 02:40.261
I BELIEVE HER.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.193
I'VE BEEN SO DRIVEN
TO FIND HER,

02:42.193 --> 02:44.735
I NEVER STOPPED TO CONSIDER
WHO SHE IS.

GRAYSON GLOBAL

02:56.947 --> 02:58.449

02:58.449 --> 02:59.950

HERE TO SEE YOU.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.932

ANY VISITORS.

03:21.932 --> 03:24.305

03:29.340 --> 03:31.642
KARA CLARKE.

03:46.757 --> 03:49.800
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.680
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOME.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.352
SO SMART TO BUILD IT
RIGHT ON THE OCEAN.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.854
YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE
YOUR ENEMIES COMING.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.726
WELL, MY ENEMIES HAVE BECOME

04:15.726 --> 04:17.728
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT
TO IDENTIFY.

04:17.728 --> 04:19.459
OH, I KNOW.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.661
I WAS SO SHOCKED TO LEARN
THAT THE MAN THAT KIDNAPPED YOU

04:21.661 --> 04:24.635
WAS THE FBI AGENT
YOU'D BEEN WORKING WITH.

04:24.635 --> 04:25.766
HE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD MAN.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.738
ALL MEN ARE BORN HARDWIRED
TO BETRAY.

04:27.738 --> 04:29.370
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.873
DO THEY HAVE ANY LEADS
ON HIS WHEREABOUTS?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.675
NO, THEY DON'T.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.577
BUT I'M SO RELIEVED

04:36.577 --> 04:39.310
THAT YOU DIDN'T FALL VICTIM
TO HIM AS WELL.

04:39.310 --> 04:40.481
OH, NO.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.913
HE GAVE ME A NEW LIFE,

04:42.913 --> 04:44.885
TAUGHT ME HOW TO LIVE
OFF THE GRID.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.817
I HADN'T SEEN HIM
FOR 20 YEARS.

04:46.817 --> 04:48.889
THEN HE SHOWS UP
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.861
WHY'D HE GO TO YOU?

04:50.861 --> 04:53.023
I DON'T KNOW.

04:53.023 --> 04:55.065
DID YOU FILE A STATEMENT
WITH THE AUTHORITIES?

04:55.065 --> 04:57.728
NO. I'M...

04:57.728 --> 05:00.471
I'M SURE
YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHY.

05:00.471 --> 05:02.403
YES.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.035
WHERE DO YOU THINK HE IS?

05:05.035 --> 05:08.038
IF HE'S WISE,
FAR, FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

05:08.038 --> 05:09.580
AND AS YOU POINTED OUT,

05:09.580 --> 05:11.942
HE'S VERY GIFTED
AT THE ART OF VANISHING.

05:11.942 --> 05:14.785
BUT I IMAGINE YOUR MAIN CONCERN
IS ABOUT AMANDA.

05:14.785 --> 05:17.448
OF COURSE.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.820
YOU'VE BEEN
SO INCREDIBLY KIND TO HER...

05:19.820 --> 05:22.423

05:22.423 --> 05:24.755
AND IN SUCH A PUBLIC WAY.

05:24.755 --> 05:27.097
I NEVER WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE
TO FIND HER OTHERWISE.

05:27.097 --> 05:29.800
WELL, IT WAS THE LEAST
I COULD DO FOR HER, POOR THING.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.734
TRAGEDY AND SORROW SEEM TO
FOLLOW HER EVERYWHERE SHE GOES.

05:35.806 --> 05:37.808

05:37.808 --> 05:41.372

05:41.372 --> 05:43.814

05:46.346 --> 05:48.749
(Aiden) WELL, I TAKE
NO PLEASURE IN SAYING THIS,

OH, UH, THEY--THEY DO
HOURLY CHECKS.

10:19.349 --> 10:24.054
EH, SAY NO MORE. I, UH,
HAVE TO GO SEE SOMEONE ANYWAY.

10:24.054 --> 10:25.956
HANG IN THERE, PAL.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.060
(Aiden) ENCOURAGING NUMBERS.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.662
YOU SHOULD ALSO READ
THE ANALYSIS.

10:31.662 --> 10:33.363
WHY? WOULD IT TELL ME
A DIFFERENT STORY?

10:33.363 --> 10:35.165
IT WILL
IF MY DAD TOOK A PASS...

10:35.165 --> 10:36.636
(door opens)
 DANIEL,

10:36.636 --> 10:38.769
AN ALERT'S COME THROUGH
THE SYSTEM.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.971
ASHLEY DAVENPORT,
AIDEN MATHIS.

10:40.971 --> 10:43.944
CHARMED. WE DIDN'T OFFICIALLY
GET TO MEET THE OTHER DAY.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.716
HELLO.
 HI.

10:45.716 --> 10:47.417
AIDEN IS
MR. TAKEDA'S PROXY.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.249
MY FATHER ASKED ME
TO ACQUAINT HIM

10:49.249 --> 10:51.051
WITH ALL THINGS
GRAYSON GLOBAL.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.955
SO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY,
FEEL FREE TO SAY IT.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.857
PERSONNEL'S FLAGGED
AN OUTSIDE REQUEST

10:56.857 --> 10:59.760
FOR DAVID CLARKE'S
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.931
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:00.931 --> 11:02.863
A BONA FIDE TERRORIST
USED TO WORK HERE.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.095
THAT'S SOMETHING WE TRY HARD
TO FORGET.

11:05.095 --> 11:06.436
WHO'S LOOKING FOR IT?

11:06.436 --> 11:10.070
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE A MEETING
MIGHT BE PRUDENT.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.042
SET IT UP. LET'S SEE
WHO'S SUDDENLY CURIOUS.

11:12.042 --> 11:14.374
NOW BACK TO
THE QUARTERLIES.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.906
SUDDENLY, I'M MORE INTERESTED

11:15.906 --> 11:19.079
IN THIS COMPANY'S
MORE HISTORIC ASSOCIATIONS.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.381
WHY DON'T WE INTRODUCE
MR. MATHIS

11:21.381 --> 11:22.983
TO THE POWER
OF THE CORPORATE CARD?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.284
DRINKS TONIGHT AT RINELLAS?

11:27.317 --> 11:29.019
(cell phone rings)

11:29.019 --> 11:32.692
(ring)

11:32.692 --> 11:34.024
(ring)

11:34.024 --> 11:35.125
(beep)

11:36.997 --> 11:39.069
(cell phone rings)

11:39.069 --> 11:40.871
(ring)

11:40.871 --> 11:42.072
(beep)

11:42.072 --> 11:43.033
HELLO?

11:43.033 --> 11:44.374
SOMEONE'S INTERESTED

11:44.374 --> 11:46.907
IN YOUR FATHER'S CONTRACT
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.308
ANY REASON TO THINK
IT'S YOUR MOTHER?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.810
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.042
I'VE CHECKED EVERY HOTEL
AND HOSTEL IN THE AREA.

11:52.042 --> 11:53.784
DID YOU CHECK THE GRAYSONS'?

11:53.784 --> 11:55.285
Conrad took a phone call
from Victoria,

11:55.285 --> 11:56.817
paled at the sound
of her voice.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.048
(pounding on door)

11:58.048 --> 11:59.089
(Nolan) EMILY!

11:59.089 --> 12:01.021
KEEP ME POSTED.
 (beep)

12:02.392 --> 12:04.194
(seagulls calling)

12:04.194 --> 12:06.426
WAY TO KEEP ME
OUT OF THE LOOP, EMS.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.059
YOUR MOTHER'S SUMMERING
IN THE HAMPTONS?

12:09.059 --> 12:10.230
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.402
JACK, WHO'S CURRENTLY
REGISTERING A 6

12:12.402 --> 12:13.764
ON THE FREAK-O-METER.

12:13.764 --> 12:15.105
ME? I'M AT 9,

12:15.105 --> 12:17.337
WHICH MUST PUT YOU
AT INFINITY TIMES INFINITY.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.508
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

12:18.508 --> 12:19.870
WELL, ASSUMING
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME

12:19.870 --> 12:21.071
TO CHECK YOUR MESSAGES EITHER.

12:21.071 --> 12:24.114
OTHERWISE YOU'D KNOW
THAT, UH...

12:24.114 --> 12:25.315
MY DAD DIED.

12:26.817 --> 12:28.879
(exhales)
OH, MY GOD, NOLAN.

12:28.879 --> 12:32.222
LOOK, I KNOW HE WASN'T
MURDERED IN PRISON

12:32.222 --> 12:34.885
OR ACCUSED OF A CRIME
HE DIDN'T COMMIT,

12:34.885 --> 12:37.057
STILL... (chuckles)

12:37.057 --> 12:40.190
TURNS OUT HE LOVED ME.

12:41.892 --> 12:44.995
(sighs) I SHOULD'VE
BEEN THERE FOR YOU.

12:44.995 --> 12:46.336
I'M SORRY.

12:46.336 --> 12:48.869
HMM.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.500
MM, IT'S OKAY.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.402
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THAT.

12:52.402 --> 12:54.845
TELL ME ABOUT KARA CLARKE.

12:54.845 --> 12:57.878
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT SHE
THINKS AMANDA IS HER DAUGHTER.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.151
THAT'S GOOD FOR...
REVENGE-Y STUFF,

13:01.151 --> 13:03.483
BUT SAD FOR YOU.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.155
I'M SORRY, EMS.
 (pressing keys)

13:05.155 --> 13:07.457
LET'S SEE.

13:07.457 --> 13:09.559
(Conrad) SO WHAT ARE
YOUR PLANS, MS. CLARKE?

13:09.559 --> 13:11.521
(Victoria) I SHOULD HOPE
THAT YOU'D STAY WITH US.

13:11.521 --> 13:13.793
SHE'S STAYING
AT THE GRAYSONS'?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.896
YOU THINK IT'S SAFE HERE?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.197
WHAT ABOUT YOUR KIDNAPPER?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.900
THAT MAN IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A SLIPPERY COWARD

13:19.900 --> 13:21.501
WHO WOULDN'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO DARKEN OUR DOORSTEP.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.104
EVEN IF HE DID,
HE'D BE SHOT ON SIGHT.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.575
IN OTHER WORDS,

13:25.575 --> 13:28.138
SO LONG AS YOU REMAIN
UNDER OUR ROOF, YOU'LL BE SAFE.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.841
NO PLACE LIKE HOME.
HUH, AUNTIE EMS?

13:30.841 --> 13:32.943
(cell phone rings)

13:32.943 --> 13:34.284
(ring)

13:34.284 --> 13:36.446
(beep)
 HEY, JACK.

13:36.446 --> 13:38.448
Emily... (speaks indistinctly)

13:38.448 --> 13:40.490
OH, MY GOD.

13:40.490 --> 13:43.253
YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

13:43.253 --> 13:44.494
(beep)

13:44.494 --> 13:46.226
AMANDA'S OUT OF HER COMA.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.960
(sighs)
WELL, THAT'S GOOD. RIGHT?

13:49.960 --> 13:51.962
IT IS UNTIL
MY MOTHER HEARS THE NEWS.

13:51.962 --> 13:55.335
SHE'S NOT
OUT OF THE WOODS YET.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.912
(Jack) HEY, WELCOME BACK.

14:01.912 --> 14:03.073
WE GOT SOMEONE HERE
WHO WANTS TO MEET YOU.

14:03.073 --> 14:04.274
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

14:04.274 --> 14:05.946
(Carl fussing)

14:05.946 --> 14:07.447
(voice breaks)
THAT'S HIM?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.950
IS HE OKAY?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.922
(crying and fussing)

14:11.922 --> 14:14.254
THIS IS YOUR MOMMY.
 (exhales)

14:17.457 --> 14:18.929
(whispers) OH.

14:18.929 --> 14:23.633
(continues crying)

14:23.633 --> 14:25.966
HE'S SO LITTLE.

14:25.966 --> 14:30.100
DON'T WORRY. HE'S TOUGHER
THAN HE LOOKS, LIKE HIS MOM.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.945
I DIDN'T KNOW THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD BE HERE WHEN I WOKE UP.

14:36.446 --> 14:38.248
WELL, WE'RE HERE.

14:38.248 --> 14:42.312
NEITHER ONE OF US
IS GOING ANYWHERE. ALL RIGHT?

14:42.312 --> 14:46.456
THANKS FOR COMING BACK TO US.
I COULDN'T DO THIS ALONE.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.658
WELCOME BACK, AMANDA.

14:51.521 --> 14:52.662
(sighs)

14:52.662 --> 14:54.524
WE'RE GONNA GO HOME SOON,
OKAY?

14:54.524 --> 14:56.596
WHERE'S MOMMY?

14:58.328 --> 15:00.100
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER LAST?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.671
WE WERE SWIMMING.

15:01.671 --> 15:03.673
MM-HMM.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.079
DO YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES
WHEN PEOPLE GET SICK,

15:09.079 --> 15:10.981
NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY

15:10.981 --> 15:13.283
AND NO MATTER
HOW MANY DOCTORS HELP,

15:13.283 --> 15:15.415
THEY JUST AREN'T ABLE
TO GET BETTER?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.988
BUT MOMMY SAID
SHE WAS BETTER.

15:19.589 --> 15:21.221
SHE WANTED TO BE.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.324
SHE WANTED THAT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.925
BUT I--

15:25.925 --> 15:28.128
SHE JUST--
SHE WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.000
WHERE IS SHE?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.563
SHE'S...
(voice breaks) GONE.

15:36.066 --> 15:38.438
OKAY?

15:38.438 --> 15:41.171
I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

15:41.171 --> 15:44.174
(Carl continues crying)

15:49.279 --> 15:51.151
I'LL LET YOU TWO
GET ACQUAINTED.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.452
(mouths word)

15:52.452 --> 15:54.484
(sighs deeply)

15:54.484 --> 15:57.557
YOU MUST BE SO RELIEVED.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.959
LOOK, I KNOW THE STOWAWAY'S
NOT OPEN YET,

15:59.959 --> 16:02.032
AND AMANDA STILL HAS
A BUNCH OF STUFF AT MY HOUSE,

16:02.032 --> 16:04.964
SO THEY'RE WELCOME TO STAY
WITH ME TEMPORARILY.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.336
ARE YOU SURE?

16:06.336 --> 16:07.497
CARL HAS A LOT OF STUFF

16:07.497 --> 16:09.539
FOR SOMEONE
WHO ONLY WEIGHS 7 POUNDS.

16:09.539 --> 16:12.342
(chuckles) I'LL ALWAYS
HAVE A ROOM FOR HIM.

16:12.342 --> 16:14.344
(mouths word)

16:14.344 --> 16:16.146
HAVE YOU CALLED
AMANDA'S MOM YET?

16:16.146 --> 16:20.080
I WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL
I TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS BACK.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.082
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.084
AND YOU SHOULD GO HOME,
TAKE A BREAK...

16:24.084 --> 16:25.515
CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

16:25.515 --> 16:28.018
(chuckles) I STINK?

16:28.018 --> 16:30.620
EH, A SHOWER WOULDN'T
KILL YOU. (laughs)

16:32.762 --> 16:35.125
THANKS, EMILY.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.067
(Carl crying)

16:37.067 --> 16:39.229
HEY, I'M, UH,
I'M RUNNING HOME FOR A BIT,

16:39.229 --> 16:42.202
BUT EMILY'S HERE
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, OKAY?

16:42.202 --> 16:45.205
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

16:47.707 --> 16:50.440
CONGRATULATIONS.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.142
HE'S SOMETHIN'.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.686
YEAH. HE IS.

16:56.686 --> 16:58.688
WE'RE SURVIVORS.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.022
AMANDA, I HAD NO RIGHT
TO PUT YOU IN THAT SITUATION.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.326
I'M SO SORRY.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.627
SO THE HUNT FOR YOUR MOTHER
IS OVER?

17:08.627 --> 17:11.060
SHE'S BACK, AMANDA.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.732
SHE SHOWED UP LAST NIGHT.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.105
GOOD.

17:15.105 --> 17:17.267
SO AT LEAST IT WASN'T
ALL FOR NOTHING.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.269
(knock on door)

17:19.269 --> 17:20.609
MS. CLARKE?

17:20.609 --> 17:22.771
YOU READY TO COME WITH ME
FOR THOSE LAST FEW TESTS?

17:24.273 --> 17:25.444
MM-HMM.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.618
I CAN LOOK AFTER CARL
IF YOU WANNA GO.

17:30.780 --> 17:35.525
IS THAT WHERE DAVID LIVED?

17:35.525 --> 17:39.159
HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD FALLEN IN
LOVE WITH THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR.

17:41.161 --> 17:45.165
I'M SORRY IF THAT
MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.638
WELL, THINKING ABOUT DAVID
ALWAYS MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.303
I IMAGINE THAT'S SOMETHING
WE BOTH SHARE.

17:56.246 --> 18:00.210
WHY DID YOU SAVE ME
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO?

18:00.210 --> 18:03.813
A LOT OF WOMEN WOULD'VE FELT
THREATENED BY ME.

18:03.813 --> 18:05.715
ALTHOUGH... (chuckles)

18:05.715 --> 18:09.789
TECHNICALLY,
 YOU'RE THE OTHER WOMAN, NOT ME.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.162
YOU KNOW, HE LED ME TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE DEAD

18:12.162 --> 18:14.264
FOR THE LONGEST TIME.

18:14.264 --> 18:18.298
OBVIOUSLY, WE BOTH FELL PREY
TO DAVID'S DECEPTION.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.201
AND NOW GORDON'S.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.434
MOM?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.678
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE HOSPITAL.

18:28.678 --> 18:30.810
AMANDA'S AWAKE AND OKAY.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.744
CHARLOTTE, THIS IS
AMANDA'S MOTHER, KARA CLARKE.

18:36.346 --> 18:37.487
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

18:37.487 --> 18:39.719
I'LL COME BACK
AND BRING MY THINGS.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.492
(whispers) THANK YOU. (kisses)

18:42.492 --> 18:44.194
YOU ASKED HER
TO STAY WITH US?

18:44.194 --> 18:46.296
TEMPORARILY, YES.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.298
I FEEL SO BAD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER DAUGHTER

18:48.298 --> 18:49.829
THAT I JUST WANTED
TO HELP OUT.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.403
WOW. MAYBE YOU HAVE CHANGED.

19:03.713 --> 19:06.716
(spraying)

19:06.716 --> 19:08.248
♪♪♪

19:08.248 --> 19:10.280
OH, DEC!

19:10.280 --> 19:12.422
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
IT SMELLS TERRIBLE IN HERE.

19:12.422 --> 19:16.226
I KNOW. I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN
WITH WHAT WE HAVE... POPS.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.288
(chuckles)

19:18.288 --> 19:20.260
HOW'S AMANDA?

19:20.260 --> 19:21.591
SHE'S GOOD.

19:21.591 --> 19:24.394
SHE'S GOOD.
WE'RE, UH... WE'RE GOOD.

19:24.394 --> 19:25.735
GOOD.

19:25.735 --> 19:27.437
THAT'S GOOD.

19:27.437 --> 19:29.699
YEAH, WELL, SOMETHING'S GOTTA BE
WHEN I'M STANDING IN THE PLACE

19:29.699 --> 19:32.372
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
MAKING US OUR LIVING

19:32.372 --> 19:33.703
AND PAYING
THESE HOSPITAL BILLS.

19:33.703 --> 19:36.776
I KNOW. UM, KENNY STOPPED BY
TODAY WITH A PLAN "B."

19:36.776 --> 19:38.248
HE SAYS THAT

19:38.248 --> 19:40.179
THAT GUY CAN GET DONE
WHAT WE NEED FAST AND CHEAP.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.412
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

19:42.412 --> 19:44.314
YEAH, ME, TOO,

19:44.314 --> 19:46.316
ONLY MY JUDGMENT'S BEEN
A LITTLE BIT OFF LATELY AND...

19:46.316 --> 19:47.287
(chuckles)
 YEAH, WELL,

19:47.287 --> 19:49.889
I WANTED TO WAIT
FOR YOUR OKAY.

19:49.889 --> 19:53.893
WELL, HE'S A BUSINESSMAN
WHO WANTS HIS MONEY.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.496
WHY HAVE US WASTE
ANY MORE OF IT, RIGHT?

19:56.496 --> 19:59.669
I'LL GIVE THIS GUY
A CALL RIGHT NOW.

19:59.669 --> 20:04.203
(telephone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

20:04.203 --> 20:06.306
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.
I'M DANIEL GRAY--
 DANIEL GRAYSON.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.409
I KNOW. PADMA LAHARI,
NOLCORP C.F.O.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.640
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.312
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?

20:12.312 --> 20:13.643
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

20:13.643 --> 20:16.416
WHEN A SIMPLE REQUEST GETS
AN OUTSIZED RESPONSE,

20:16.416 --> 20:19.389
EITHER SOMETHING'S WRONG
OR I'VE WON SOMETHING.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.451
HAVE I WON SOMETHING?

20:21.451 --> 20:23.323
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE
PLAYING FOR, SHALL WE?

20:23.323 --> 20:24.524
PLEASE, SIT.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.400
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
INFORMATION ABOUT DAVID CLARKE.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.263
YES. I NEED TO CORROBORATE
HIS INITIAL TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

20:33.263 --> 20:34.434
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.805
I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
THE SENSITIVITY

20:35.805 --> 20:37.907
WE STILL FEEL OVER
THE UNFORTUNATE ASSOCIATION

20:37.907 --> 20:39.639
THIS COMPANY HAS
WITH SUCH A MAN.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.512
YES. I IMAGINE IT CAN BE
QUITE TRICKY.

20:42.512 --> 20:44.414
TELL ME,

20:44.414 --> 20:46.245
what do the terms
of Mr. Clarke's employment

20:46.245 --> 20:47.647
at a Wall Street
investment firm

20:47.647 --> 20:50.350
have to do with a tech company
like Nolcorp?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.851
I wanted to make sure

20:51.851 --> 20:54.324
THAT WHEN NOLCORP INVESTED
IN GRAYSON GLOBAL YEARS AGO

20:54.324 --> 20:56.486
THAT DAVID CLARKE WASN'T
ON THE ACCOUNT.

20:56.486 --> 20:57.827
IT WOULDN'T DO

20:57.827 --> 20:59.759
TO HAVE A TERRORIST HANDLING
OUR FINANCES, WOULD IT?

20:59.759 --> 21:02.692
I'LL LOOK INTO IT
AND GET BACK TO YOU.

21:05.795 --> 21:07.497
AND MUCH OBLIGED.

21:14.344 --> 21:15.705
SO THAT EXPLAINS THAT.

21:15.705 --> 21:18.047
I'M NOT SURE IT DOES.

21:18.047 --> 21:21.581
TYLER TRIED TO LAND NOLCORP
LAST SUMMER FOR THE FIRST TIME,

21:21.581 --> 21:24.414
WHICH MEANS THEY'VE NEVER
INVESTED WITH US BEFORE.

21:24.414 --> 21:27.056
(knocks on doorframe)

21:27.056 --> 21:29.058
ARE WE STILL ON FOR DRINKS?

21:31.491 --> 21:34.494
(Carl fussing)

21:35.665 --> 21:37.827
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING
MY GRANDSON?

21:46.436 --> 21:50.540
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SETTLE HIM.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.482
I'M HIS GODMOTHER.

21:52.482 --> 21:54.344
I'M KARA,

21:54.344 --> 21:55.945
AMANDA'S ACTUAL MOTHER.

21:57.847 --> 21:59.419
MAY I?

21:59.419 --> 22:01.591
DON'T WORRY.

22:01.591 --> 22:03.453
HE KNOWS HIS FAMILY.

22:03.453 --> 22:05.054
OHH.

22:05.054 --> 22:07.357
AMANDA WAS THE SAME WAY,

22:07.357 --> 22:10.530
ALWAYS HAPPY
IN HER MOMMY'S ARMS. OH!

22:10.530 --> 22:12.602
THE PERFECT LITTLE BABY BOY.

22:12.602 --> 22:14.934
WHAT WAS AMANDA LIKE
AS A KID?

22:16.606 --> 22:18.107
SHE...

22:19.439 --> 22:21.371
SHE WAS SO GENTLE.

22:21.371 --> 22:24.444
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN LET ME
KILL A SPIDER.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.615
NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL,

22:25.615 --> 22:30.079
I HAD TO CATCH IT IN A GLASS
AND SET IT FREE OUTSIDE.

22:30.079 --> 22:34.684
SHE JUST ALWAYS HAD
THIS INNATE GOODNESS.

22:34.684 --> 22:37.587
DOES SHE EVER TALK
ABOUT ME?

22:39.589 --> 22:41.130
HONESTLY, NO.

22:43.693 --> 22:46.596
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

22:46.596 --> 22:50.440
WELL, NOW THAT IS
A FASCINATING QUESTION.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.802
OH, PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

22:52.802 --> 22:54.143
MASON TREADWELL.

22:54.143 --> 22:56.105
AND IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE KARA CLARKE?

22:58.548 --> 23:01.581
YES. YES, I AM.

23:03.553 --> 23:05.084
GOD, I LOVE THE HAMPTONS.

23:10.159 --> 23:11.921
YOU SEE, I WAS
INEXORABLY DRAWN BACK HERE

23:11.921 --> 23:14.393
IN PURSUIT OF THE TRUTH BEHIND
YOUR DAUGHTER'S RECENT WELCOME

23:14.393 --> 23:17.467
INTO THE GRAYSON FOLD,
WHICH MAKES YOUR APPEARANCE...

23:17.467 --> 23:19.529
HOW SHALL I SAY IT?
A REVELATION.

23:19.529 --> 23:20.670
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

23:20.670 --> 23:24.634
OH, I AM, MY DEAR,
AND SO WONDERFULLY ARE YOU.

23:24.634 --> 23:27.076
THE YEARS HAVE BEEN KIND, KARA.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

23:27.076 --> 23:28.578
AWAY.

23:28.578 --> 23:31.811
OH, THAT'S ONE OF
MY FAVORITE PLACES.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.513
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING,

23:33.513 --> 23:35.014
WHY LET YOUR DAUGHTER THINK
THAT YOU WERE DECEASED

23:35.014 --> 23:36.986
THESE LAST TWO DECADES?

23:36.986 --> 23:38.848
(whispers) I DO.

23:38.848 --> 23:40.550
(normal voice)
I DO MIND YOU ASKING.

23:40.550 --> 23:43.793
WOW. WHEN YOU GET A C.A.T. SCAN,
YOU THROW ME A PARTY.

23:43.793 --> 23:45.695
(Mason chuckles)
WELL, ADMITTEDLY, I'M A CRASHER,

23:45.695 --> 23:47.997
BUT ONE WHO ONLY BRINGS
WELL-WISHES.

23:47.997 --> 23:49.599
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:49.599 --> 23:51.130
PAYING MY RESPECTS,
OF COURSE.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.633
PLEASE, ALLOW ME.
 (sighs)

23:53.633 --> 23:54.604
PLEASE.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.610
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
QUITE ENOUGH, MASON.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.613
I'LL COME BACK.

24:07.617 --> 24:09.849
(sighs)

24:09.849 --> 24:13.683
AMANDA, SWEETIE...

24:13.683 --> 24:14.954
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

24:17.056 --> 24:18.958
(Carl crying)

24:18.958 --> 24:22.231
I THINK CARL'S HUNGRY.
I'LL BRING HIM TO YOU.

24:22.231 --> 24:23.462
OH, SWEETHEART.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.465
(crying)

24:27.767 --> 24:31.100
SHH. SHH.

24:32.742 --> 24:35.575
KARA, I THINK WE SHOULD
LET THESE TWO REST.

24:37.246 --> 24:38.608
WHEN AMANDA'S RELEASED,

24:38.608 --> 24:39.809
SHE'LL BE STAYING WITH ME
FOR A FEW DAYS.

24:39.809 --> 24:42.151
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO COME VISIT
IN THE MORNING?

24:42.151 --> 24:43.613
YES.

24:43.613 --> 24:47.116
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

24:47.116 --> 24:49.759
MAYBE I COULD DRIVE YOU HOME.

24:49.759 --> 24:54.964
SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.
I REALLY THOUGHT SHE WOULD.

24:54.964 --> 24:58.497
CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW THAT MUST FEEL.

25:00.069 --> 25:02.672
HAVE YOU READ
TREADWELL'S BOOK?

25:02.672 --> 25:04.233
MM. I STILL CAN'T ACCEPT

25:04.233 --> 25:07.777
THAT DAVID WAS CAPABLE
OF SUCH TERRIBLE THINGS.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.781
HE WAS
MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART.

25:11.781 --> 25:12.742
(chuckles)

25:12.742 --> 25:14.584
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

25:14.584 --> 25:17.617
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN OR HOW
YOU'LL MEET YOUR TRUE LOVE.

25:19.749 --> 25:22.822
HE WAS ONLY MY FIRST LOVE.

25:22.822 --> 25:23.953
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

25:27.697 --> 25:31.831
WELL, AT LEAST DAVID
DIDN'T DESTROY AMANDA.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.567
NO.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.769
HE DIDN'T.

25:39.769 --> 25:40.940
(siren wailing)

25:40.940 --> 25:43.873
I KNOW I'VE BEEN A.W.O.L.,
BUT...

25:43.873 --> 25:46.646
I JUST BECAME AN UNCLE.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.979
WELL, ONE OF THOSE
NON-UNCLE UNCLES,

25:49.979 --> 25:53.022
LIKE KRACKER OR FESTER.

25:53.022 --> 25:56.626
PRETTY SURE FESTER ACTUALLY WAS
GOMEZ'S OLDER BROTHER.

25:56.626 --> 25:59.589
ALL RIGHT, YOU PASS.

25:59.589 --> 26:01.731
(siren wailing in distance)

26:06.696 --> 26:08.067
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

26:08.067 --> 26:10.339
IT WAS AMONGST
YOUR FATHER'S MEMORABILIA.

26:10.339 --> 26:11.941
YOU DID NOTHING WITH IT?

26:11.941 --> 26:14.043
NO. WHY?

26:14.043 --> 26:15.975
SHOULD I?
 NOPE.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.648
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, BUT...

26:18.648 --> 26:21.881
NOT BEFORE
I TAKE YOU TO BREAKFAST.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.754
(laughs) BUT IT'S 10:00
AT NIGHT, NOLAN.

26:30.219 --> 26:32.321
THEN WE'VE GOT
SOME TIME TO KILL.

26:32.321 --> 26:34.323
(chuckles)

26:34.323 --> 26:38.698
TO A GROWING RELATIONSHIP,
BOTH BUSINESS AND PERSONAL.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.069
(clink)
 WELL, TELL THAT TO MY DAD.

26:40.069 --> 26:42.331
THE COMPANY'S FALLING APART,
AND HE LEAVES BEFORE LUNCH.

26:42.331 --> 26:43.833
WHICH IS SOMETHING

26:43.833 --> 26:45.735
I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME
TO CONVEY TO MR. TAKEDA.

26:45.735 --> 26:50.139
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY WE ENGLISH
ARE STEREOTYPED AS RESERVED.

26:50.139 --> 26:52.742
CANDOR RUNS THE RISK
OF BROOKING DISCONTENT.

26:52.742 --> 26:56.986
OH, WELL, THE AMERICAN WAY IS
TRUTH, HONESTY...

26:56.986 --> 26:58.617
AND A TINY BLADDER.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.789
OH. (chuckles)

26:59.789 --> 27:01.090
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I...

27:01.090 --> 27:02.121
(imitates British accent)
NEED TO USE THE LOO.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.954
(laughs)
 (laughs) VERY GOOD.

27:04.954 --> 27:07.156
♪♪♪

27:07.156 --> 27:08.828
YOU MAKE A NICE COUPLE.

27:08.828 --> 27:12.001
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ANYONE SPECIAL?

27:12.001 --> 27:13.332
WELL, THE NOMADIC LIFESTYLE

27:13.332 --> 27:16.105
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR
MUCH PERMANENCE, I'M AFRAID.

27:16.105 --> 27:18.768
ALTHOUGH MR. TAKEDA DID MENTION
SOMEBODY THAT I SHOULD LOOK UP.

27:18.768 --> 27:20.309
UH, A MISS, UM...

27:20.309 --> 27:22.011
EMILY... THORPE?

27:22.011 --> 27:23.072
THORNE.

27:23.072 --> 27:24.243
AH.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.275
SHE AND DANIEL
USED TO BE ENGAGED.

27:26.275 --> 27:29.148
WELL, LEAVE IT TO ME
TO STEP IN IT.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.051
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.
SHE DID.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.282
SHE CHEATED ON HIM.

27:33.282 --> 27:36.786
WELL, TO, UH,
YOUR GOOD FORTUNE

27:36.786 --> 27:38.657
AND, UM, MAYBE MINE.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.359
WE NOMADS HAVE LITTLE NEED
FOR FIDELITY,

27:40.359 --> 27:42.361
SO I MAY RING HER UP.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.767
(sighs)

27:47.767 --> 27:49.038
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

27:49.038 --> 27:51.300
BUT YOU TOLD ME
TO KEEP YOU POSTED.
 (keys clatter)

27:51.300 --> 27:53.873
NO, I MEAN,
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.776
(closes drawer)
 MY MOTHER IS NEXT DOOR.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.947
SHE SEES YOU,
OUR COVER'S BLOWN--

27:57.947 --> 27:58.948
NOT JUST WITH HER
BUT WITH THE GRAYSONS,

27:58.948 --> 28:00.249
WHICH WOULD NEVER
HAVE HAPPENED

28:00.249 --> 28:02.712
IF YOU HADN'T GONE TO SEE HER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

28:02.712 --> 28:04.884
(sighs) WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28:04.884 --> 28:07.016
TO INFORM YOU THAT THE INQUIRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S CONTRACT

28:07.016 --> 28:09.819
CAME FROM A WOMAN
NAMED PADMA LAHARI,

28:09.819 --> 28:11.260
CLAIMING TO BE
NOLCORP'S C.F.O.

28:11.260 --> 28:12.421
SHE PULLS THAT THREAD,

28:12.421 --> 28:14.123
IT COULD EXPOSE THE SOURCE
OF YOUR WEALTH.

28:14.123 --> 28:17.296
I LIQUIDATED MY NOLCORP STOCK
YEARS AGO.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.028
BUT THIS COULD BE BAD
FOR NOLAN.

28:19.028 --> 28:20.429
WELL, HE'S NOT MY CONCERN.

28:20.429 --> 28:22.071
WELL, HE'S MINE.

28:22.071 --> 28:25.234
WHAT'S SHE DOING?

28:27.306 --> 28:29.939
(cell phone rings)

28:29.939 --> 28:31.781
THAT'S HIS PHONE,
ISN'T IT?

28:31.781 --> 28:33.112
(ring)

28:33.112 --> 28:35.144
(ring)
 YOU HAD IT ALL ALONG.

28:35.144 --> 28:37.987
(ring)
 ANSWER THAT PHONE AND IT WILL BE
THE LAST THING YOU EVER DO.

28:37.987 --> 28:40.249
YOU WANNA DO THIS ALONE?

28:40.249 --> 28:41.951
FINE.

28:41.951 --> 28:44.994
BUT YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT I MAKE
A FAR BETTER PARTNER THAN ENEMY.

28:55.264 --> 28:57.736
HOW LONG UNTIL HIGH TIDE?

28:57.736 --> 28:58.968
20 MINUTES?

28:58.968 --> 29:01.871
I LIKE LIVING ON THE EDGE
OF...

29:01.871 --> 29:03.242
THE LAND,

29:03.242 --> 29:05.274
THE WATER,

29:05.274 --> 29:07.216
OF THE HONEYDEW.

29:08.417 --> 29:10.379
(cell phone rings)

29:10.379 --> 29:11.750
(ring)

29:11.750 --> 29:12.751
(ring)

29:12.751 --> 29:13.853
(ring)

29:13.853 --> 29:16.125
(ring)

29:16.125 --> 29:18.287
(ring, beep)

29:18.287 --> 29:19.959
MORNING, SUNSHINE.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.330
WE NEED TO TALK.

29:21.330 --> 29:22.862
I've been trying
to get ahold of you all night.

29:22.862 --> 29:25.194
MM. SOUNDS SERIOUS.

29:25.194 --> 29:26.765
Need my help?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.197
NO. YOU NEED MINE.

29:28.197 --> 29:29.899
I'M ALREADY SHOCKED.

29:29.899 --> 29:32.341
SOMEONE FROM YOUR COMPANY
ASKED DANIEL

29:32.341 --> 29:34.303
ABOUT MY FATHER'S INVESTMENT.

29:36.305 --> 29:38.477
Nolan, it was Padma.

29:43.552 --> 29:44.984
YOU OKAY?

29:46.916 --> 29:50.159
THEN DRINK UP
BEFORE WE'RE UNDERWATER.

29:50.159 --> 29:51.861
(clink)

29:53.522 --> 29:56.896
(Jack) JUST ONE NIGHT,
I PROMISE.

29:56.896 --> 29:57.867
(Emily) NOT A PROBLEM.

29:57.867 --> 29:59.028
(Jack) ALL RIGHT.

29:59.028 --> 30:01.971
(Carl fussing)

30:01.971 --> 30:05.935
I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA TAKE OFF
AND GO TO THE STOWAWAY, OKAY?

30:05.935 --> 30:07.576
OKAY.

30:09.939 --> 30:11.911
THANKS AGAIN.

30:13.282 --> 30:15.985
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

30:17.546 --> 30:19.919
DEPENDS WHO YOU ASK.

30:19.919 --> 30:23.252
JACK SEEMS HAPPY

30:23.252 --> 30:26.555
WITH HIS LITTLE CARL.

30:26.555 --> 30:30.029
BUT EVERY TIME I SEE HIM
HOLDING THE BABY, I JUST...

30:30.029 --> 30:34.203
I WANNA TELL HIM THE TRUTH,
THAT CARL ISN'T HIS.

30:34.203 --> 30:37.907
BUT, OF COURSE, I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH YOUR MOM FIRST.

30:37.907 --> 30:39.268
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
TELL HER THE TRUTH,

30:39.268 --> 30:42.912
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS
AND SHE HAS TO LEAVE.

30:42.912 --> 30:47.877
YOU SPENT ALL THIS TIME,
RISKED MY LIFE LOOKING FOR HER,

30:47.877 --> 30:49.548
AND NOW YOU JUST
WANT HER TO LEAVE?

30:49.548 --> 30:51.280
(sighs deeply)

30:53.082 --> 30:56.025
WHILE YOU WERE RECOVERING,

30:56.025 --> 30:58.557
A MEMORY CAME BACK TO ME.

31:00.930 --> 31:03.362
WHEN I WAS 5,
MY MOTHER TRIED TO KILL ME.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.864
SHE SUCCEEDED, ACTUALLY.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.937
SHE DROWNED ME.

31:07.937 --> 31:10.369
MY FATHER HAD TO BRING ME
BACK TO LIFE.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.602
(whispers) I...
HOW COULD A MOTHER DO THAT?

31:16.005 --> 31:18.407
MAYBE SOMEDAY I'LL KNOW,
BUT FOR NOW...

31:18.407 --> 31:20.449
(exhales deeply)

31:20.449 --> 31:24.013
THE BEST THING FOR US,
AND ESPECIALLY FOR CARL,

31:24.013 --> 31:25.985
IS THAT SHE LEAVES.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.117
CALL HER.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.967
(knock on door)

31:37.967 --> 31:41.470
(telephone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

31:41.470 --> 31:42.631
(sighs)

31:42.631 --> 31:44.974
SEE, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT MARTINIS.

31:44.974 --> 31:48.377
TWO'S NOT ENOUGH,
FOUR IS TOO MANY.

31:48.377 --> 31:52.011
I COULD USE ANOTHER DRINK
AFTER THE MORNING WE'RE HAVING.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.643
YOU SHOULD TELL TAKEDA
TO TAKE HIS MONEY AND RUN.

31:54.643 --> 31:56.515
BUT THAT WOULD DEBILITATE
GRAYSON GLOBAL.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.987
WELL, MAYBE WE DESERVE IT.

31:57.987 --> 32:00.189
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

32:00.189 --> 32:02.952
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT'S WHY
YOU WANT US TO DIVEST.

32:02.952 --> 32:05.524
I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT
THE CHAINS THAT BIND ME.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.057
SO?

32:09.558 --> 32:11.200
I MAY HAVE SOMETHING.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.432
IT'S ABOUT
THE NOLCORP REQUEST.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.504
OKAY, HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

32:15.504 --> 32:18.207
BECAUSE I'M AMBITIOUS,
SAME AS YOU.

32:18.207 --> 32:22.041
WHEN DAVID CLARKE WORKED HERE,
HE RAN VENTURE CAPITAL, RIGHT?

32:22.041 --> 32:23.712
WHAT IF NOLAN ROSS CAME TO HIM
FOR START-UP MONEY?

32:23.712 --> 32:26.015
BUT HE DIDN'T,
OR THERE'D BE A RECORD OF IT.

32:26.015 --> 32:29.948
NOT IF THE MONEY HE INVESTED
CAME FROM A PERSONAL ACCOUNT.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.420
SEE, I THINK THE YOUNG LADY
FROM NOLCORP

32:31.420 --> 32:33.582
WAS TRYING TO SNIFF OUT WHETHER
OR NOT CLARKE'S CONTRACT

32:33.582 --> 32:35.484
CONTAINED
AN EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSE.

32:35.484 --> 32:38.487
WHICH IT WOULD HAVE.
THEY ALL DO.

32:38.487 --> 32:40.389
WHICH MEANS HE WAS WORKING
ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY,

32:40.389 --> 32:42.291
REGARDLESS OF WHERE
THE CAPITAL CAME FROM.

32:42.291 --> 32:45.194
WHICH ALSO MEANS...

32:45.194 --> 32:46.365
THIS COMPANY HAS

32:46.365 --> 32:49.338
A CONTROLLING INTEREST
IN NOLCORP.

32:49.338 --> 32:52.041
WE PLAY THIS RIGHT,
WE GUARANTEE TWO THINGS--

32:52.041 --> 32:54.603
ME A SEAT HERE ON THE BOARD,
AND YOU...

32:54.603 --> 32:56.445
THE SEAT BEHIND
YOUR FATHER'S DESK.

32:56.445 --> 32:58.247
(exhales)

33:01.410 --> 33:02.751
PUT ME THROUGH TO PERSONNEL.

33:02.751 --> 33:04.753
ARCHIVES.

33:06.455 --> 33:08.557
(grunts)

33:12.091 --> 33:13.362
(groans)

33:13.362 --> 33:14.993
THERE MAY BE NO SADDER SIGHT

33:14.993 --> 33:17.666
THAN A WOMAN ATTEMPTING
TO ROB HER OWN HOUSE.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.029
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU MISPLACED SOMETHING,

33:20.029 --> 33:24.073
LIKE THE DEAD WOMAN WHO I HEAR
HAS BEEN SLEEPING IN THIS BED.

33:24.073 --> 33:27.606
THOUGH BEING DEAD IS DE RIGUEUR
AROUND HERE THESE DAYS.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.578
YOU SHOULD TRY IT SOMETIME,
MASON.

33:29.578 --> 33:32.141
AND HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?
 EVERY MAID HAS HER PRICE,

33:32.141 --> 33:35.013
ESPECIALLY
WHEN GROTESQUELY UNDERPAID.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.187
I READ
YOUR "VANITY FAIR" ARTICLE.

33:38.187 --> 33:40.449
IT WAS LIKE GAZING AT
YOUR LOVELY VISAGE, VICTORIA--

33:40.449 --> 33:43.322
THE MOST ELEGANT BLEND
OF FACT AND FICTION.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.593
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

33:44.593 --> 33:45.794
WHAT DO ANY OF US WANT?

33:45.794 --> 33:47.696
THE TRUTH.

33:47.696 --> 33:50.499
I CAME TO UNEARTH IT ABOUT
YOUR LUDICROUS KIDNAPPING STORY,

33:50.499 --> 33:54.032
BUT NOW I'VE STUMBLED ACROSS
SOMETHING THAT'S FAR JUICIER.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.664
NOW IF MEMORY SERVES,

33:55.664 --> 33:58.267
YOU TOLD ME
THAT KARA CLARKE WAS DEAD.

33:58.267 --> 33:59.768
I HONESTLY BELIEVED THAT.

33:59.768 --> 34:04.343
DO YOU... GAG A LITTLE
WHEN YOU SAY THAT? "HONESTLY"?

34:04.343 --> 34:07.176
I THINK YOU'VE FAILED
TO UNDERSTAND

34:07.176 --> 34:09.618
THE THREAT KARA POSES
TO ALL OF US.

34:09.618 --> 34:11.150
SHE MAY KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT DAVID,

34:11.150 --> 34:14.223
IN WHICH CASE, SHE WILL
TAKE YOU DOWN ALONG WITH US.

34:14.223 --> 34:16.155
I THINK I'LL BE FINE.

34:21.590 --> 34:24.263
(knocks on doorframe)

34:24.263 --> 34:26.094
(mouths words)

34:26.094 --> 34:27.396
(whispers) SORRY.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.341
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.

34:36.145 --> 34:37.406
(whispers)
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

34:44.253 --> 34:46.355
(Kara)
I... (clears throat)

34:46.355 --> 34:49.788
I UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.760
SO I'LL JUST...

34:51.760 --> 34:54.163
I'LL JUST SAY MY PIECE
THEN GO.

34:54.163 --> 34:56.324
DESPITE...

34:56.324 --> 35:00.399
ALL THE ODDS AGAINST YOU,

35:00.399 --> 35:02.231
YOU SURVIVED.

35:04.203 --> 35:07.576
AND YOU'VE GROWN
INTO AN AMAZING,

35:07.576 --> 35:10.839
AMAZING YOUNG WOMAN.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.643
YOU'RE STRONG.

35:14.643 --> 35:17.186
YOU'RE INDEPENDENT.

35:17.186 --> 35:19.148
YOU'RE...

35:19.148 --> 35:20.889
(voice breaks)
YOU'RE EVERYTHING

35:20.889 --> 35:24.893
THAT I... COULD EVER HAVE
HOPED FOR YOU TO BE.

35:29.228 --> 35:32.231
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT, UM,

35:32.231 --> 35:33.802
I WAS VERY SICK...

35:35.133 --> 35:37.166
FOR A LONG TIME.

35:37.166 --> 35:39.208
(inhales sharply)
AND I W--

35:39.208 --> 35:43.672
I WAS NOT FULLY IN CONTROL
OF MY ACTIONS.

35:46.875 --> 35:48.647
(crying)

35:48.647 --> 35:51.480
AND...

35:51.480 --> 35:54.223
YOUR FATHER AND I

35:54.223 --> 35:55.854
MADE A CHOICE...

35:57.426 --> 36:01.660
ONE THAT I KNEW I WOULD
H-HAVE TO LIVE WITH.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.170
(kisses)

36:14.543 --> 36:18.176
(crying) YOU NEED TO TELL HER
I DIED.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.610
IT'LL BE BETTER FOR HER
IF SHE THINKS I'M GONE.

36:21.610 --> 36:25.754
(monitor beeping steadily)

36:29.818 --> 36:32.321
(Kara) SOMEHOW, YOUR FATHER
FOUND IT IN HIS HEART

36:32.321 --> 36:34.563
TO FORGIVE ME.

36:34.563 --> 36:36.395
(crying)

36:36.395 --> 36:38.196
OH. (sighs deeply)

36:38.196 --> 36:39.498
(gasps)

36:42.701 --> 36:44.202
(sniffles) WAIT.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.935
I FORGIVE YOU, TOO.

37:04.453 --> 37:05.794
(Jack) SO THIS IS IT.
WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

37:05.794 --> 37:07.856
(chuckles) WE CAN FINALLY
START PAYING YOU BACK.

37:07.856 --> 37:10.799
WELL... THERE MAY BE
A BIGGER OPPORTUNITY HERE.

37:10.799 --> 37:13.802
FRANKLY, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE IN THE BAR BUSINESS.

37:13.802 --> 37:15.003
YOU WANNA BUY IT?

37:15.003 --> 37:16.535
I WILL FORGIVE
YOUR KID BROTHER'S DEBT

37:16.535 --> 37:18.367
IF YOU LET ME.

37:18.367 --> 37:19.538
(sighs)

37:19.538 --> 37:20.769
I ASKED AROUND, JACK,

37:20.769 --> 37:22.741
HEARD WHAT THIS PLACE DID
TO YOU.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.943
YOUR MOM LEFT.
YOUR DAD DIED.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.445
SO YOU WANNA PULL
14-HOUR SHIFTS

37:26.445 --> 37:29.478
OR YOU WANNA SPEND QUALITY TIME
WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL FAMILY?

37:32.821 --> 37:34.783
OKAY. LET'S TALK.

37:35.784 --> 37:37.286
I KNEW YOU WERE SMART.

37:37.286 --> 37:38.787
WELL...
WHAT'D THE INSPECTOR SAY?

37:38.787 --> 37:40.529
THERE'S THE BOY WONDER.

37:40.529 --> 37:42.431
DEC, WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS

37:42.431 --> 37:44.563
AND WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

37:48.897 --> 37:50.869
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
READING A BOOK?

37:50.869 --> 37:53.001
YEAH, IT CALMS ME.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

37:53.001 --> 37:55.974
WELL, I FOUND THIS HIDDEN
IN KARA'S ROOM.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.806
(cell phone beeps)
 THERE'S ONE NUMBER ON IT.

37:57.806 --> 37:59.408
THAT'S
GORDON MURPHY'S NUMBER.

37:59.408 --> 38:02.981
MM-HMM. SHE'S MADE CALLS OUT.
NONE CAME IN.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.913
KARA'S BEEN
FEEDING HIM INFORMATION.

38:04.913 --> 38:07.986
TOO MANY PEOPLE KNOW
OUR SECRETS, CONRAD.

38:07.986 --> 38:08.957
AND IF THEY SURFACE,

38:08.957 --> 38:10.989
THE INITIATIVE IS GOING TO
COME AFTER US--

38:10.989 --> 38:12.861
AND WORSE, OUR CHILDREN.

38:12.861 --> 38:14.022
I DON'T KNOW
WHO TO TURN TO.

38:14.022 --> 38:15.824
YOU CAN TURN TO ME,
OF COURSE.

38:15.824 --> 38:16.995
OH, PLEASE.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.997
VICTORIA GRAYSON,

38:18.997 --> 38:22.471
WILL YOU DO ME THE HONOR
OF BECOMING MY WIFE?

38:22.471 --> 38:24.803
AGAIN.
 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.475
J-JUST LET ME FINISH.

38:26.475 --> 38:29.508
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
AND TO BE LEGALLY BOUND

38:29.508 --> 38:30.939
SO THAT WE MAY NEVER
BE COMPELLED

38:30.939 --> 38:34.042
TO TESTIFY AGAINST EACH OTHER
IN A COURT OF LAW.

38:36.915 --> 38:40.649
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID
TO YOUR MOM.

38:40.649 --> 38:44.092
FORGIVING HER, IT JUST...
(whispers) CAME OUT.

38:45.794 --> 38:48.357
DON'T BE.

38:48.357 --> 38:49.728
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

38:54.633 --> 38:59.838
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT CARL.

39:03.712 --> 39:04.873
I LIED TO YOU.

39:06.975 --> 39:09.578
JACK REALLY IS THE FATHER.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.022
(exhales)

39:14.022 --> 39:15.954
OH, MY GOD.

39:19.988 --> 39:21.530
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

39:22.831 --> 39:26.094
I GUESS I FELT LIKE I NEEDED
TO KEEP YOU ON MY SIDE.

39:26.094 --> 39:29.438
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?

39:29.438 --> 39:31.069
MAYBE BECAUSE OF IT.

39:33.602 --> 39:37.946
I KNOW I HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THIS.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.484
I'M SO SORRY.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.816
ME, TOO.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.089
I KNEW YOU HAD FEELINGS
FOR JACK

39:51.089 --> 39:54.593
WHEN I TRICKED HIM
INTO BELIEVING I WAS YOU.

39:55.964 --> 39:58.166
AND NOW I HAVE
THIS INCREDIBLE FAMILY.

39:58.166 --> 40:01.099
(sniffles) IT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU DESERVE BETTER,

40:01.099 --> 40:04.633
AND...
JACK DESERVES THE TRUTH.

40:06.575 --> 40:09.037
JACK DESERVES HAPPINESS.

40:09.037 --> 40:11.109
IF YOU TELL HIM
THE TRUTH NOW,

40:11.109 --> 40:13.942
IT'LL ONLY BREAK HIS HEART
ALL OVER AGAIN.

40:22.190 --> 40:24.653
(Emily) OVER TIME,
WE COMMIT ACTS WITH INTENTIONS,

40:24.653 --> 40:26.525
EITHER GOOD OR BAD,

40:26.525 --> 40:28.827
THAT REQUIRE FORGIVENESS.

IT'S OKAY.

41:03.592 --> 41:06.865

JUST THE WOMAN
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

41:38.266 --> 41:40.599
A QUICK RAID OF MY RESEARCH
CONFIRMED THAT

41:40.599 --> 41:42.170
YOU HAD A TERRIBLE SCAR

41:42.170 --> 41:45.203
FROM A BURN YOU HAD SUFFERED
IN A FOSTER CARE FIRE--

41:45.203 --> 41:48.807
ONE THAT I COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE IS NOW MISSING.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.078
I HAD IT REMOVED.

41:50.078 --> 41:51.079
DID YOU?
 MM-HMM.

41:51.079 --> 41:52.981
FROM WHAT PART
OF YOUR BODY?

41:52.981 --> 41:54.242
(chuckles)

41:54.242 --> 41:56.645
WHY DO YOU CARE, MASON?

41:56.645 --> 41:57.986
I THINK YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW

41:57.986 --> 42:00.949
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION,
MY DEAR.

42:00.949 --> 42:03.652
YOU MAY BE MANY THINGS
TO MANY PEOPLE--

42:03.652 --> 42:06.795
THE LATEST, IT WOULD SEEM,
A YOUNG MOTHER TO AN INFANT BOY.

42:06.795 --> 42:10.829
BUT THE DAUGHTER OF
KARA WALLACE AND DAVID CLARKE?

42:10.829 --> 42:12.200
(grunts)

42:12.200 --> 42:16.164
THAT IS ONE THING THAT
YOU MOST DEFINITELY ARE NOT.
