01:15.784 --> 01:58.785
Good morning.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.369
Morning.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.964
Get your fingers
out of the icing.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.842
Tommy Lee,
get your fingers
out of the frosting.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.608
[Bang]

03:12.693 --> 03:13.985
Wave those flags, son.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.528
Get out of there!

03:15.612 --> 03:17.321
Yeah!
Hit them again!

03:17.406 --> 03:18.781
Get out of here!

03:18.866 --> 03:21.367
Get out of them

03:21.451 --> 03:22.368
Aah!

03:22.452 --> 03:23.452
[Bang Bang]

03:23.537 --> 03:25.872
Yeah! Get 'em!
Migrate south,
will you?

03:25.956 --> 03:27.248
Mama.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.001
Mama!

03:30.085 --> 03:32.003
Three more radios
for you, Shelby.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.337
Not now, Tommy.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.507
Mama, this nail polish
is drying way too dark.

03:36.592 --> 03:40.011
Practically paint my foot.
Looks like a stuck pig
bled all over my hands.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.805
I'm sure I have
something that will do.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.224
Oh, no.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.059
It has
to be delicate.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.603
If I don't
have something,

03:48.687 --> 03:49.896
I will send your brothers

03:49.980 --> 03:51.522
to get delicate pink
nail polish.

03:51.607 --> 03:52.481
Mama, there's...

03:52.566 --> 03:53.733
Just a minute.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.736
Great idea, Mama.
I'd love to see what the boys
would pick out.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.070
Delivery man!

03:58.155 --> 04:00.072
Someone stop that truck!
Stop that...

04:00.157 --> 04:01.657
Aah!

04:01.742 --> 04:03.951
Don't put ice
down my back!

04:04.036 --> 04:05.912
You should have
drowned them at birth.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.204
Shelby.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.998
See if you can get this.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.333
Mama, my nails are wet.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.834
Shelby.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.170
Ma'am.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.505
Would you look
at those, please?

04:19.176 --> 04:20.676
Myrtle, hi.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.844
[Bang]

04:21.928 --> 04:23.346
Hold on, please.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.556
I'm going to get you
right now!

04:25.641 --> 04:26.557
[Bang]

04:26.642 --> 04:30.061
Drum, sweetheart,
I'm on the phone!

04:30.145 --> 04:31.145
[Bang]

04:31.229 --> 04:33.773
Stop that now!
I can't hear myself think!

04:33.857 --> 04:34.774
[Bang]

04:34.858 --> 04:37.777
Myrtle, the champagne glasses,
they're all broken.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.362
Help.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.207
Spud!

04:59.967 --> 05:02.301
[Television Plays]

05:02.386 --> 05:05.763
Spud, turn off
that stupid television.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.266
Get in here and finish
dyeing these easter eggs.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.768
I ran out of stuff.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
That's why God
invented the A&P.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.772
I got to work
on the truck.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.774
No. You got
to get the lead out.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.818
Yes, ma'am.
I live to serve.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.779
If those eggs are not
at the church by noon,

05:21.863 --> 05:23.155
they don't get hidden.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.323
[Door Slams]

05:24.408 --> 05:26.826
Are you listening
to me, Spud?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.123
Mrs. Jones?

05:32.207 --> 05:33.416
Are you Annelle?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.210
Oh, you sweet thing.
Come on in.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.170
Excuse me.

05:38.255 --> 05:42.008
And pick up my green dress
at the cleaners!

05:42.092 --> 05:44.010
Am I interrupting
something?

05:44.094 --> 05:46.512
No. I'm just screaming
at my husband.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.306
I can do that anytime.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.767
Please, call me Truvy.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.519
Truvy. Thank you.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.855
Mama, look at this.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.857
This was in
the hall closet.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.316
What is it?

05:59.401 --> 06:00.860
Rubbers.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.111
Tommy says
Jonathan's planning

06:02.195 --> 06:04.739
to cover the honeymoon
getaway car with these.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.033
Please stop him!

06:07.117 --> 06:08.451
Keep your voice down.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.910
Keep your voice...
Jonathan!

06:09.995 --> 06:12.371
Boys, I want
to talk to you.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.414
Tommy. Jonathan!

06:13.498 --> 06:14.540
Tommy!

06:14.624 --> 06:18.878
Jonathan, don't you
decorate your sister's car
with condoms!

06:18.962 --> 06:20.296
It's tacky!

06:21.298 --> 06:23.257
It's like talking
to a brick wall.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.258
[Bang]

06:24.342 --> 06:26.260
If he's trying
to drive me crazy,

06:26.344 --> 06:27.386
it's too late.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.723
There must be a better way
to get rid of those birds.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.726
We could cut down
all our trees

06:33.810 --> 06:35.269
or change
the migratory patterns

06:35.353 --> 06:36.562
of North American birds.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.231
You told him
to get rid of them.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.068
I had no idea
he would alienate
the entire neighborhood.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.903
The neighborhood
would be more alienated

06:43.987 --> 06:46.280
if they got covered
in bird shit

06:46.364 --> 06:47.615
at my reception.

06:47.699 --> 06:51.285
Pretty talk.
You have to be so crude?

06:58.502 --> 07:00.628
[Coughing]

07:04.007 --> 07:05.257
Okay.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.093
Oops.
I see a hole.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.637
Yeah. I was hoping
you'd catch that.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.932
It's a little bit pouffier
than I would normally do,

07:13.016 --> 07:14.433
but I'm nervous.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.393
Oh, I'm not worried
about that.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.896
I usually wrap
my entire head in toilet paper

07:18.980 --> 07:20.439
when I go to bed,

07:20.524 --> 07:22.441
so it gets
pretty smooshed down

07:22.526 --> 07:23.734
in that process, anyway.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.903
In my class
at the trade school,

07:25.987 --> 07:28.572
I was number one
in frosting
and streaking.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.074
I did my own.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.784
Really?

07:31.868 --> 07:32.785
That's good.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.496
And I can usually
spot a bottle job

07:35.580 --> 07:36.997
at 20 paces.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.500
Your technique
is really good.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.835
Thanks.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.922
I think your form and content
will improve with time.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.424
So, best I can tell, young lady,

07:47.509 --> 07:49.468
you've just landed yourself a job.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.304
Oh! Great!
Oh, thank you!

07:52.389 --> 07:53.973
Oh, thank you,
Miss Truvy.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.975
No time for thanks
this morning.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.477
We'll be busier than
a one-armed paper hanger.

07:58.562 --> 07:59.812
Here.
Let me help you.

07:59.896 --> 08:00.980
I got it.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.566
You got hairs and fuzzies
all over you.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.068
There's so much
static electricity
in this room,

08:06.153 --> 08:08.863
I pick up everything
but boys and money.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.410
Louie!

08:14.494 --> 08:16.370
Louie, hold up.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.997
I want you
to meet Annelle.

08:18.081 --> 08:18.873
Hi.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.875
She's taking Judy's place.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.376
Swell.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.838
Louie, take out the garbage!

08:25.922 --> 08:27.006
Can't!

08:27.090 --> 08:28.632
Late.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.969
What did you
hire her for?

08:35.390 --> 08:36.640
Our son.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.809
We're so proud of him.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.855
Annelle, honey,
what do you say
we talk some trash?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.023
Okay.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.651
I am so excited.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.320
I can't believe
it's happening.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.654
I'm a beautician.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.866
Ah-ah-ah.
Glamour technician.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.784
Glamour technician.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.245
And I'll have you know
you are working

08:58.330 --> 09:00.789
in the most successful shop
in this town.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.541
I have a strict philosophy

09:02.626 --> 09:05.211
that I have stuck to
for 15 years...

09:05.295 --> 09:10.966
There is no such thing
as natural beauty.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.261
You remember that,
or we're all out of a job.

09:14.346 --> 09:17.389
Look at me.
It takes some effort
to look like this.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.225
Oh, I can see that.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.311
How long
have you been in town?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.729
A few weeks.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.939
New in town.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.983
It must be exciting
being in a new place.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.945
I wouldn't know.
I've lived here all my life.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.240
Well, tell me things
about yourself.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.741
There's
nothing to tell.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.577
I live here.
I've got a job now.

09:38.662 --> 09:39.912
That's it.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.414
Can I borrow
these back issues
of Southern Hair?

09:42.499 --> 09:43.749
Sure. Take them.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.084
It is essential

09:45.168 --> 09:47.920
to stay abreast
of the latest styles.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.922
I'm glad
to see your interest.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.424
Well, you must live close by.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.218
At least in walking distance.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.928
I didn't see a car.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.391
I don't have a car.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.893
I've been staying
across the river

10:02.978 --> 10:04.603
at Robeline's
boarding house.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.606
That's quite a walk.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.400
Ruth Robeline.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.819
Now there is a story for you.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.780
She is a troubled,
twisted soul.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.367
Her whole life has been
an experiment in terror.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.995
Her husband got killed
in World War II.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.872
Then her son got killed
in Vietnam.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.708
When it comes to suffering,

10:25.792 --> 10:28.294
she is right up there
with Elizabeth Taylor.

10:28.378 --> 10:29.962
I had no idea.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.547
[Horn Honks]

10:33.216 --> 10:35.050
Hello, Clairee!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.260
Good morning.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.345
Annelle, I'd like
to introduce you

10:38.430 --> 10:40.347
to the former first lady
of Chinquapin...

10:40.432 --> 10:41.473
Mrs. Belcher.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.018
Clairee, I'd like you
to meet Annelle.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.644
I'm a little embarrassed.
I'm windblown.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.480
I've just been to the dedication
of the new children's park.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.316
Yeah.
How did that go?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.775
Beautifully,

10:51.860 --> 10:55.612
except Janice Van Meter
got hit with a baseball.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.156
It was fabulous.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.490
Was she hurt?

10:58.575 --> 11:01.452
I doubt it.
She got hit in the head.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.996
Janice Van Meter's
the current mayor's wife.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.164
We hate her.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.000
They named the new park
after Clairee's late husband.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.294
This town is
so proud of her.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.837
That's nice.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.923
What's your
family name, dear?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.968
Well, my married name
is Dupuy,

11:18.053 --> 11:20.346
and I'm originally from Zwolle.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.764
How nice.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.807
Annelle, honey,
there's some towels
in the dryer.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.643
Would you fold them
and bring them in?

11:26.728 --> 11:27.686
Sure.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.645
Thank you.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.981
Sweet gal.
Where did you find her?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.316
Yesterday, when Judy quit,

11:32.400 --> 11:33.817
I called the trade school

11:33.902 --> 11:36.820
and told them
to send me a warm body.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.823
Annelle was the valedictorian
of the hairdo class.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.826
And I think there's a story there.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.745
What makes you
say that?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.705
Well, for starters,
she's married,

11:46.790 --> 11:49.708
but she's living
over at Ruth Robeline's.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.126
Alone.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.254
I'd get to the bottom of this
if I were you...

11:54.339 --> 11:56.799
if you have silverware
you'd like to keep.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.760
I'm not worried.
She's as sweet
as she can be.

11:59.844 --> 12:04.056
Besides, I kind of like the idea
of hiring somebody with a past.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.808
She can't be
more than 18.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.394
She hasn't had time
to have a past.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.728
Get with it, Clairee.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.063
This is the '80s.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.899
If you achieve puberty,
you can achieve a past.

12:13.983 --> 12:14.900
[Bang Bang]

12:14.984 --> 12:15.901
Whoa!

12:15.985 --> 12:17.069
That man!

12:17.153 --> 12:18.987
I swear, I don't know

12:19.072 --> 12:21.323
how M'Lynn
puts up with that.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.161
Go on! Get out of here!

12:59.863 --> 13:00.946
Jackson, please.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.407
I'm going to talk
some sense into you.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.827
It's bad luck to see me
before the wedding.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.538
So you are going to marry me.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.539
Jackson...

13:10.623 --> 13:13.959
We can work this out,
Shelby, please.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.462
You want to
go through with this.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.798
I don't want to give back
all the wedding presents.

13:19.883 --> 13:24.136
That VCR alone is worth
getting married for,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.180
and I love you.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.640
[Bang Bang]

13:28.725 --> 13:30.476
If Daddy
catches you in here,

13:30.560 --> 13:32.978
whether or not I can
carry your children

13:33.062 --> 13:34.313
will not matter.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.981
He will cut your thing off.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.858
Say you're going
to marry me.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.402
I hate suspense.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.656
Okay. Okay.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.951
You meet me at 2:00.
Presbyterian church.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.079
I'll be the one in the veil
down front.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.669
Oh.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.214
I'm going to make you
very happy.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.138
We'll see.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.938
Boy, give me the sports.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.197
Boys, we're off to Truvy's.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.033
Jonathan, keep your eye
on your brother Tommy.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.368
Am I my brother's keeper?

14:29.452 --> 14:31.703
Your brother's warden
is what you are.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.705
That horrible woman
is coming by

14:33.790 --> 14:36.166
to deliver the groom's cake
in about an...

14:38.878 --> 14:40.546
Where's your father?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.464
His coffee
kicked in.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.135
Shelby, let's go.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.930
Okay, Mama.
I said I'd be right there.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.229
Shelby, you're going to be
late for your own wedding.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.399
I'm wearing my hair down
'cause Jackson likes it down.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.402
The veil would be prettier
with your hair up.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.571
Get over it, Mama.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.655
Whoops.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.739
[Woof Woof]

15:07.824 --> 15:10.659
Come here!
Stop it, Rhett!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.452
Oh, shit!

15:12.537 --> 15:13.996
It's Miss Ouiser.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.747
Back door.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.583
[Woof Woof Woof]

15:19.252 --> 15:20.627
Drum!

15:20.712 --> 15:21.878
Rhett!

15:21.963 --> 15:22.963
M'Lynn!

15:23.047 --> 15:25.591
Open the door!
I know you're in there!

15:25.675 --> 15:27.259
Drum!

15:27.343 --> 15:29.428
I think
there's somebody
at the door.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.763
I think
it's for Daddy.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.807
I know you're in there!

15:33.891 --> 15:35.267
[Pounding On Door]

15:35.351 --> 15:36.810
That is all she wrote!

15:36.894 --> 15:38.729
Say please.

15:38.813 --> 15:39.855
Thank you.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.442
Get over here,
Rhett!

15:43.526 --> 15:45.152
Stop pulling!

15:45.236 --> 15:47.112
Sit. Oh, Rhett!

15:47.196 --> 15:49.406
Sit! Sit.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.869
Ouiser, you look
like hammered shit.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.621
Don't talk to me like that!

15:55.705 --> 15:58.457
I'm sorry. You look
like regular shit.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.126
I have such a bone
to pick with you.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.005
Woof! Aah!

16:05.089 --> 16:06.465
Stop egging him on.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.466
Come here.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.218
Listen, I have just
come from the vet.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.596
Come here, Rhett.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.306
Whitey Black says

16:14.390 --> 16:15.974
that all this noise

16:16.059 --> 16:17.601
that you've
been making around here

16:17.685 --> 16:19.144
for the last few days

16:19.228 --> 16:22.314
has been causing a nervous
condition in my dog.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.150
Look at this.
All his hair's falling out.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.818
[Woof Woof]

16:26.903 --> 16:28.904
I got to give this animal
tranquilizers.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.739
Whitey Black is a moron.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.659
I'm not even sure
he has opposable thumbs.

16:33.743 --> 16:37.120
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have work out in the backyard.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.582
Hi, Miss Ouiser.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.417
Ecch. Leave me alone.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.919
Now you listen to me.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.421
I don't know
if I'm coming or going.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.840
I heard you got so screwed up

16:48.925 --> 16:51.301
you cut your dog
out of your will

16:51.386 --> 16:53.428
and had
an ungrateful nephew
put to sleep.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.764
I'm at the end
of my rope.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.226
Well, tie a noose in it
and slip it over your head.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.271
Oh, damn it, Ouiser.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.983
I don't want
to have to kill you.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.652
Boys! Bring me my gun!

17:08.736 --> 17:10.612
Don't you threaten me,
Drum Eatenton,

17:10.696 --> 17:12.614
or I will call the police.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.242
I got to scare away
about five zillion birds

17:15.326 --> 17:17.243
this afternoon before
Shelby's reception.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.371
If I don't, I'll have
to deal with my wife,

17:19.454 --> 17:21.748
and I make it a point
never to deal with my wife.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.625
But that dog is on
his last legs.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.294
What am I going to do
with that poor animal?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.753
Serve him on toast.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.801
You get those magnolias
out of my tree?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.971
The judge has not decided
whose tree that is exactly.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.806
It is mine.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.726
I will
speak to M'Lynn
about this.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.148
Now, are these
chocolate chips
semisweet or milk?

17:46.232 --> 17:47.566
They're milk.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.901
Is the Karo syrup
light or dark?

17:49.986 --> 17:51.403
It's a matter of taste.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.738
Where's
the other one

17:52.822 --> 17:54.030
you were
talking about...

17:54.115 --> 17:55.240
A cuppa-cuppa-cup?

17:55.324 --> 17:57.409
That's simple. You don't
need to write that down.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.578
A cup of flour,
a cup of sugar,

17:59.662 --> 18:01.830
a cup of fruit cocktail
with the juice,

18:01.914 --> 18:04.124
and you mix
and bake at 350

18:04.208 --> 18:05.250
to a golden bubbly.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.252
Sounds awfully rich.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.630
It is.
So I serve it over ice cream
to cut the sweetness.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.466
I'll be right back,
honey.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.052
Well, M'Lynn,
looks like you're
ready to roll.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.055
I think we can trust
Annelle to do that.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.892
Honey, her coiffure card's
in a box on the counter.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.226
Oh, I don't know.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.728
Today is a very special day,

18:24.812 --> 18:27.397
and my work tends
to be too pouffy
when I'm nervous.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.733
You stop that.
You're a professional now,

18:29.817 --> 18:32.027
so get over there
and bang some hair.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.532
Does your dress
have to go over your head?

18:38.701 --> 18:39.993
No.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.870
Oh, good.

18:42.872 --> 18:43.789
I'm sorry.

18:43.873 --> 18:44.915
Relax.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.917
You can't
screw up her hair.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.669
Just make it look
like a brown
football helmet.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.380
I must have missed
the passage in Emily Post

18:52.465 --> 18:55.926
that said all abuse is heaped
on the mother of the bride.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.220
Oh, hush, girls.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.305
Shelby, your mama
never tells us much.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.515
What's Jackson like?

19:01.599 --> 19:02.849
He's really cute.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.851
I thought he was a pest at first,

19:04.936 --> 19:07.145
but he kind of grew on me
and now I love him.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.689
You made
a very good catch, Shelby.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.984
Louisiana lawyers do well,
whether they want to or not.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.361
I don't really care.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.695
Don't get me wrong.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.697
The money's real nice and all,

19:17.782 --> 19:21.326
but I just like the idea
of growing old with somebody.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.328
My dream is to get old

19:23.412 --> 19:26.331
and sit on the back porch
covered with grandchildren

19:26.415 --> 19:28.416
and say "no"
and "stop that."

19:28.501 --> 19:30.794
Are you going to quit
your nursing job?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.295
Never. I love it.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.840
I love being around
all those babies.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.341
Drum and I both feel

19:36.425 --> 19:38.885
she should not work
after she gets married.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.304
I'm so anxious to discuss this topic

19:41.389 --> 19:43.056
for the 900th time this week.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.267
You should not be on your feet
all day long.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.352
You should be kinder
to your circulatory system.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.896
You know what you need
in here, Truvy?

19:49.981 --> 19:51.231
You need a radio.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.733
Music is a wonderful thing
to have in the background.

19:53.818 --> 19:57.779
It takes the pressure off everybody
feeling they have to talk so much.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.197
I used to have one,

19:59.282 --> 20:00.907
but I slammed it
against the wall

20:00.992 --> 20:03.660
when I couldn't figure out
where the batteries went.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.161
Of course I know now

20:05.246 --> 20:08.415
I was suffering from
premenstrual syndrome.

20:08.499 --> 20:11.585
Radio... What did I just...

20:11.669 --> 20:13.461
Oh, yes.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.215
The Antilley family
is selling KPPD.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.343
I wonder how much
radio stations sell for.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.346
Miss Clairee, you should buy KPPD.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.015
You got plenty of money.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.559
What would I do
with a radio station?

20:27.643 --> 20:28.852
Business never interested me.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.271
Lloyd took care
of all that stuff.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.066
I hope you and Jackson
will be as happy

20:35.151 --> 20:36.693
as Lloyd and I were.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.862
We had such a good time...

20:38.946 --> 20:40.906
until November.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.785
At least he hung on
through the state playoffs.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.830
Miss Clairee,
there are still good times to be had.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.543
Well, I really do love football,

20:53.628 --> 20:57.505
but it's hard to parlay that
into a reason to live.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.300
What are your colors, Shelby?

21:00.384 --> 21:01.968
They're Blush and Bashful.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.637
Ooh!

21:03.721 --> 21:05.430
Her colors are pink and pink.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.767
My colors are Blush
and Bashful, Mama.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.645
How precious is this wedding
going to get?

21:11.729 --> 21:13.688
My colors are Blush and Bashful.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.857
I have chosen two shades of pink.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.734
One is much deeper than the other.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.946
But the bridesmaids' dresses,
they are really beautiful.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.323
The ceremony will be, too.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.784
The walls are banked
with sprays of flowers

21:25.868 --> 21:28.453
in my two shades
of Blush and Bashful,

21:28.537 --> 21:31.957
pink carpet specially
laid out for my service,

21:32.041 --> 21:33.291
and pink silk bunting

21:33.376 --> 21:36.252
draped over anything
that would stand still.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.839
That sanctuary looks
like it's been hosed
down with Pepto-Bismol.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.134
I like pink.
Pink is my signature color.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.552
How many
bridesmaids?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.054
Nine.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.098
Nine? Good lord.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.307
Exactly.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.477
Mama made me have my cousins
and Margie St. Maurice.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.479
Let's not go into this now.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.147
There was no way around it.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.774
It will be pretentious.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.150
And Daddy always says,

21:59.235 --> 22:01.695
"An ounce of pretension's
worth a pound of manure."

22:01.779 --> 22:04.197
The poet laureate
of Dogwood Lane.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.491
Mama, I wish you'd
get off Daddy's back.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.659
Shelby, look. I don't...

22:07.743 --> 22:09.494
Fill us in
on the reception.

22:09.578 --> 22:13.039
My reception,
my reception...

22:13.124 --> 22:15.583
Ferns, dancing,
tons of people,

22:15.668 --> 22:18.294
every pink flower
west of the Mississippi,

22:18.379 --> 22:20.505
wedding cake
in the dining room,

22:20.589 --> 22:24.050
and the groom's cake
hidden in the carport.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.970
Shelby and I,
we agree on one thing...

22:27.096 --> 22:29.723
The groom's cake.
The groom's cake.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.057
It's awful.

22:31.142 --> 22:34.352
It's in the shape
of a giant armadillo.

22:34.437 --> 22:35.979
An armadillo?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.564
You're joking, right?

22:37.648 --> 22:40.483
Jackson wanted a cake
in the shape of an armadillo.

22:40.568 --> 22:41.735
His aunt makes them.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.611
It's unusual.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.779
It's repulsive.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.865
It's got gray icing.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.617
I can't even begin to think
how you make gray icing.

22:49.702 --> 22:53.121
Worse, the cake part
is red velvet cake...

22:53.205 --> 22:54.414
Blood red.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.208
People are going
to be hacking into
this poor animal.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.210
It looks like
it's bleeding to death.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.463
The rehearsal supper
was a real experience.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.882
Mama, it wasn't that bad.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.718
It was at Jackson's uncle's
place on the river.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.928
Jackson's from
a good ol' Southern family

23:09.013 --> 23:10.472
with good ol' Southern values...

23:10.556 --> 23:12.557
Either shoot it,
stuff it, or marry it.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.435
They're simply outdoorsy,
that's all.

23:15.519 --> 23:18.730
Did y'all do anything
especially romantic?

23:18.814 --> 23:20.732
We drove down
to Frenchman's Point

23:20.816 --> 23:22.233
and went parking.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.443
Ooh.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.154
Oh, Shelby, really.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.697
Oh, M'Lynn,
leave her alone.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.407
This is my favorite part.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.034
This is the romantic part.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.037
Now, see, that's what
really melts my butter.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.581
Well, then,
we went skinny-dipping,

23:36.665 --> 23:38.833
and we did things that
frightened the fish.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.920
It's been a long time since
we've had a youngster
in this place.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.422
And we talked
and talked and talked.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.257
I love those kind
of talks...

23:46.342 --> 23:48.760
In the arms of
the man you love.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.096
Actually, we fought
most of the time.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.680
You fought?

23:52.765 --> 23:55.141
'Cause I told him
I wouldn't marry him.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.768
What?

23:56.852 --> 23:59.187
Why did you do
a thing like that?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.940
Oh, it's okay now.
We worked it all out.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.985
Oh, it was probably
one of those last-minute
jitter things.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.363
No, but the wedding's still on.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.615
Well, thank goodness,

24:10.699 --> 24:14.285
because this is going in
the hairdo hall of fame.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.787
Shelby,
you scared us.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.831
That wasn't a nice thing
to do to your mama.

24:17.915 --> 24:22.293
Never say a thing like that
to a woman who's marinating
50 pounds of crab claws.

24:22.378 --> 24:26.548
Oh, but the making up
can be so romantic.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.009
I miss romance so much.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.554
Oh, Truvy.
It can't be that bad.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.972
Oh, really, now?

24:34.056 --> 24:36.808
The last romantic thing
my husband did for me

24:36.892 --> 24:38.143
was back in 1972.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.521
He enclosed this carport
so I could support him.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.566
I think I have something
that could cheer you up.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.568
Drum and I have
been planning

24:46.652 --> 24:48.027
on talking
to your husband

24:48.112 --> 24:50.071
about
building a room
onto our house.

24:50.156 --> 24:56.327
If you'll give Spud a job,
I'll give you hot oil treatments
for the rest of your life.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.371
Annelle,
this looks pretty good.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.999
I think you know
what you're doing.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.000
[Annelle]
Thank you.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.460
Mrs. Eatenton,
you have great hair.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.005
Your scalp's
as clean
as a whistle.

25:07.089 --> 25:07.964
[M'Lynn]
I try.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.841
[Truvy]
It must run in the family.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.303
The young 'un's
got the prettiest hair
I ever had my hands in.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.847
Just because I'm bragging
on you, don't get lazy.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.182
Hold your head up.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.391
Stop it.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.434
Shelby?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.519
Shelby.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.645
M'Lynn!

25:23.606 --> 25:25.273
I'll get some juice.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.068
Truvy,
there's some candy
in my purse.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.237
I have some right here.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.199
Shelby, Shelby,
hold on.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.951
Clairee's getting you
some juice.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.203
Shelby, Shelby, Shelby.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.662
Should I get her a cookie?

25:39.747 --> 25:40.788
No. Juice is better.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.041
Here's the juice.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.835
Shelby.
Shelby, you need some juice.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.086
You need some juice.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.296
Stop it, Mama.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.255
Drink the juice.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.340
Please.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.968
No! Stop it, Mama!
I have some candy in my purse.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.055
You didn't bring your purse, sweetheart.
You didn't bring your purse.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.598
No, you didn't.
Here you go.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.684
There you go.
Drink some of this.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.230
It's not any wonder,

26:05.314 --> 26:08.024
with all this running around
and wedding nonsense.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.069
Excuse me. Should I call
the doctor or something?

26:11.153 --> 26:12.153
No, no.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.404
She's a diabetic.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.407
She just has a little
too much insulin,
that's all.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.077
A little more in her,
she'll be all right.

26:19.161 --> 26:22.163
If you don't
leave me alone,
I'm going to leave.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.415
I'd love to see you try.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.625
Cooperate, please.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.627
Honey, drink, please.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.796
Come on now.
That a girl.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.839
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes' yes.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.758
There you go,
there you go.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.094
There, there, there.
That's a start.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.221
This one hit her fast.

26:38.305 --> 26:41.182
She's been
so upset lately.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.894
Dr. Mitchell told her
on her last appointment...

26:46.689 --> 26:48.189
children aren't possible.

26:49.858 --> 26:53.027
Don't talk about me
like I'm not here.

26:53.904 --> 26:57.865
Oh, oh, oh.
She's making some sense now.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.492
Yes, she is.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.578
This one was not bad at all.
It was not bad at all.

27:02.663 --> 27:05.873
Now I think we need
a little more juice.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.042
Could I do
something to help?

27:08.127 --> 27:11.045
No. She'll be fine.
Don't fuss over her.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.464
Normality is very
important to Shelby.

27:13.549 --> 27:14.924
Here, M'Lynn.
Thanks.

27:15.009 --> 27:18.219
I am really sorry about
the children part, M'Lynn.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.721
I know.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.098
Shelby's afraid
that Jackson will be
throwing away

27:22.182 --> 27:23.516
his chance
to have children.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.562
Jackson said...

27:28.897 --> 27:31.482
"Shelby, don't be stupid.

27:31.567 --> 27:34.819
There's plenty of kids out there
need good homes."

27:34.903 --> 27:36.571
Drink some.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.075
"We'll adopt 10 of them.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.077
We'll buy them
if we have to."

27:43.162 --> 27:45.830
Jackson sounds like
good people to me.

27:54.465 --> 27:56.257
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.010
That's all right, honey.
Oh, it's all right.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.012
It's all over now.
It's over.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.305
You hold your juice.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.598
Okay.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.184
It's all over.
Hold your juice.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.185
All right.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.312
Okay.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.521
You all right?

28:10.606 --> 28:12.440
Oh, Truvy, I'm sorry.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.733
Oh, I'll fix it.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.943
We'll fix it.

28:18.655 --> 28:24.285
Okay.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.331
What did I do with my gun?
Where did you
leave it?

28:28.415 --> 28:30.625
How the hell do I know?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.794
Well, come on.
We have work to do.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.003
Daylight's burning.

28:34.088 --> 28:36.464
We're going to get rid
of some birds.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.597
Whoo!
Got the arrows, Daddy.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.099
All right, all right.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.768
Hey! Hey!
Lookee here, lookee here.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.187
Dad,
I got the target.

28:51.271 --> 28:54.148
No. We're not going
target shooting. Forget it.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.985
Miss Clairee,
what cute shoes.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.570
You think so?

28:59.655 --> 29:01.489
I'm not so sure
myself.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.117
They seem a little
too racy for me.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.827
I'll probably
give them away.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.830
They're just
too cha-cha for words.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.581
I'll buy them from you.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.791
What size you wear?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.251
I wear a size 6,

29:13.335 --> 29:16.546
but a 7 feels so good
I buy a size 8.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.630
They're 81/2.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.132
Perfect.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.967
Lord, give us strength.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.138
Come here, Rhett!

29:25.222 --> 29:27.181
That is
one ugly dog.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.683
What kind of dog
is that?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.018
If it had hair,
a Saint Bernard.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.605
This is it. I've found it.
I am in hell.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.023
Good morning, Ouiser.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.568
Don't try to get
on my good side.

29:38.652 --> 29:40.445
I no longer have one.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.321
You're a little early,
ain't you?

29:42.406 --> 29:44.365
That is precisely
why I'm here...

29:44.450 --> 29:46.701
to talk to M'Lynn
about her husband.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.121
He is a boil
on the butt of humanity.

29:50.205 --> 29:53.583
I'm sorry, Ouiser.
This whole thing has gotten out of hand.

29:53.667 --> 29:58.337
It's not your fault.
I used to think you
were crazy for marrying that man.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.382
Then I thought you were
a glutton for punishment.

30:01.467 --> 30:05.303
Now I realize you must be
on some mission from God.

30:05.387 --> 30:08.848
Miss Ouiser, Daddy isn't
trying to drive you crazy.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.558
He's just trying
to make my reception nice.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.602
His heart's
in the right place.

30:12.686 --> 30:15.354
Ouiser,
I know for a fact

30:15.439 --> 30:16.981
there will be
no more gunshots.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.025
He was going
to fire a gun at me.

30:19.109 --> 30:20.151
They're blanks.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.237
Drum would
never point a gun
at a lady.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.615
He's a real gentleman.

30:25.699 --> 30:28.743
I bet he takes the dishes
out of the sink
before he pees in it.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.337
Who the hell are you?

30:39.421 --> 30:42.715
Uh... Annelle.

30:42.799 --> 30:43.674
This is my new...

30:43.759 --> 30:44.675
Fine.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.011
Now I know everybody
in this town.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.014
And I don't recall
having seen you before.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.351
I just moved into town
not too long ago.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.520
With your family?

30:55.604 --> 30:57.688
I don't have any family
to speak of.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.106
Your husband?

31:01.318 --> 31:03.361
My husband?

31:03.445 --> 31:05.029
Yes.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.407
Well, that's
kind of hard to say.

31:08.492 --> 31:09.075
I, uh...

31:10.327 --> 31:11.619
I don't know.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.829
You don't know?

31:13.914 --> 31:15.289
Well, I'm not sure.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.749
You're not sure?

31:16.833 --> 31:19.710
I'm intrigued.
Are you married or not?

31:19.795 --> 31:22.088
These are not
difficult questions.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.636
Well... we're...

31:29.721 --> 31:31.597
I can't talk about it.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.140
Of course you can.

31:35.143 --> 31:38.479
Well, I'm not sure
if I'm married or not.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.772
He's gone.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.400
Men are the most
horrible creatures, honey.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.443
They will ruin your life,
mark my words.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.571
Everything is horrible.

31:46.655 --> 31:50.866
Bunky- that's my husband...
He just vanished last week.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.869
He took all the money,
my jewelry, the car.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.205
Most of my clothes
were in the trunk.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.165
He's in big trouble
with the law.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.375
Mm-hmm.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.918
Drugs or something.

32:01.003 --> 32:05.256
The police keep questioning me,
but I don't know anything.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.843
They say that our marriage
may not be legal.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.929
Well, I wish you'd
have said something.

32:12.014 --> 32:13.389
I was scared to.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.434
I need a job
in the worst way.

32:16.518 --> 32:20.104
I didn't know if you would
hire someone who may
or may not be married

32:20.188 --> 32:23.482
to someone who might be
a dangerous criminal.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.484
But, Miss Truvy, I swear to you,

32:25.569 --> 32:29.989
my personal tragedy
will not interfere with
my ability to do good hair.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.199
Of course it won't.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.786
I really don't
think things could
get any worse.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.455
Of course they can.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.498
We are awful.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.709
We are all hateful,
awful people.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.753
Here all we've
been talking about

32:43.837 --> 32:45.796

48:33.661 --> 48:35.495
We've already
pulled their heads off.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.998
No, I'm just killing time.

48:38.082 --> 48:40.750
Jackson's found a firearm.
We may never see him again.

48:40.835 --> 48:43.712
How about a glass of iced tea?
It's the house wine of the South.

48:43.796 --> 48:44.879
Perfect.

48:44.964 --> 48:46.423
Oh, coming up.

48:46.507 --> 48:47.924
Bet your mama's happy

48:48.009 --> 48:50.594
you got home in time
for the festival.

48:50.678 --> 48:52.846
I wouldn't miss the festival.
How's your family?

48:52.930 --> 48:56.016
Oh, fine.
Spud's as outgoing as ever.

48:56.100 --> 48:58.143
Louie brought
his girlfriend home,

48:58.227 --> 49:01.062
and the nicest thing
I can say about her

49:01.147 --> 49:02.981
is all her tattoos
are spelled correctly.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.441
Oh, Truvy.

49:04.525 --> 49:06.318
Get your money away.

49:06.402 --> 49:07.611
Thanks.

49:07.695 --> 49:10.905
Well, my hair's not the only
thing that's changed.

49:10.990 --> 49:12.449
So much has happened.

49:12.533 --> 49:15.493
After they finally put
Bunky Dupuy behind bars

49:15.578 --> 49:17.495
and I was rid of him,

49:17.580 --> 49:19.164
I went wild.

49:19.248 --> 49:21.499
I was running around
drinking, smoking.

49:21.584 --> 49:23.460
Jezebel.

49:23.544 --> 49:26.338
Truvy helped me see
the error of my ways.

49:26.422 --> 49:28.882
She gave me a place to live.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.425
Now I go to church.

49:30.509 --> 49:33.470
I've done guest lectures on beauty
at the trade school.

49:33.554 --> 49:36.473
Annelle's become
one of the hottest tickets in town.

49:36.557 --> 49:38.600
Oh, Truvy, hush.
It's true.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.435
Well, I am
enjoying the city more,

49:40.519 --> 49:43.188
and I'm so excited about
this Christmas festival.

49:43.272 --> 49:46.232
There's a Messiah
sing-along tomorrow. Oh, no!

49:46.317 --> 49:47.817
What's the matter?

49:47.902 --> 49:51.488
Oh, nobody move!
My contact! Oh, no!

49:51.572 --> 49:52.697
Stay back!

49:52.782 --> 49:55.533
Wait, don't move!
Can you back up, please?

49:55.618 --> 49:58.453
Hello, darlings.
When did you get into town?

49:58.537 --> 50:01.498
This afternoon.
Here, merry Christmas.

50:01.582 --> 50:02.624
Thank you.

50:02.708 --> 50:06.336
I've been trying
to show Jackson everything.
He's never been to the festival.

50:06.420 --> 50:09.172
Listen to the football
game tonight.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.840
Sure.
What are we listening for?

50:10.925 --> 50:13.468
Me.
Didn't your mama tell you?

50:13.552 --> 50:15.553
Mama never
tells anyone anything.

50:15.638 --> 50:18.723
I'm the color announcer
for the Devils. I'm fabulous.

50:18.808 --> 50:21.184
I'm just too colorful
for words.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.019
Nice of them to let you
talk on the radio.

50:23.104 --> 50:27.023
Nice, nothing.
I own the radio station.

50:27.108 --> 50:28.525
You bought it!

50:28.609 --> 50:33.738
Yes. KPPD, the station of choice
in Chinquapin Parish.

50:33.864 --> 50:36.658
Mrs. Belcher, we got to go!
The kickoff!
Bye!

50:37.660 --> 50:41.579
[Radio: Announcer]
This has been an extremely
hard-fought football game,

50:41.664 --> 50:44.666
considering the fact
that the Dry Prong lines

50:44.750 --> 50:47.877
don't seem to have
the kind of depth
that Chinquapin has.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.256
[TV Continues]

50:51.340 --> 50:53.258
Well?

50:54.552 --> 50:56.219
Nope.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.304
Rolly Bassett
got the contract.

50:59.140 --> 51:01.057
His bid was 6,000
under mine.

51:01.142 --> 51:02.767
6,000.

51:04.478 --> 51:07.397
Well, he owns all his own equipment,
and I don't.

51:10.151 --> 51:13.153
It's hell to be poor and hired out.

51:14.447 --> 51:17.365
Well, I have got some fried chicken here,
prepared by Christian women,

51:18.993 --> 51:20.410
a bottle of cheap wine,

51:20.494 --> 51:23.997
and I've arranged
for some pretty
incredible fireworks.

51:26.167 --> 51:27.417
Oh, come on, Spud.

51:27.501 --> 51:29.419
I don't want to miss

51:29.503 --> 51:32.505
the nativity made
entirely out of sparklers.

51:32.590 --> 51:35.091
I don't feel much like it.

51:35.176 --> 51:38.178
Well, you will
once we get there.

51:39.305 --> 51:41.347
I'm happy where I am.

51:42.516 --> 51:43.725
Spud.

51:45.519 --> 51:47.937
We always watch
the fireworks.

51:48.022 --> 51:50.690
Whoa. That's the ball game.
Final score...

51:50.775 --> 51:53.777
This is KPPD Radio,

51:53.861 --> 51:56.237
station of choice
in Chinquapin Parish,

51:56.322 --> 52:00.200
coming to you live
from the Devils' locker room.

52:00.284 --> 52:05.079
This is Bark Boone
with color announcer
Clairee Belcher.

52:05.164 --> 52:06.539
Thank you, Bark.

52:06.624 --> 52:10.126
You know, Bark,
it's a shame our
listeners can't be here

52:10.211 --> 52:14.255
to see the gorgeous
new Devil uniforms.

52:14.340 --> 52:16.800
Uh... they're lovely.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.635
I would never have chosen
those white pants.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.429
They're filthy.
I would have gone
with a darker color.

52:21.514 --> 52:24.349
White shows everything.
Just look at those grass stains.

52:24.433 --> 52:26.059
Impossible to get out.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.478
It's hard
to keep white clean
when you're tackled.

52:28.562 --> 52:32.106
But I love the tops,
such a vibrant purple.

52:32.191 --> 52:35.318
Would you call this color
grape or aubergine?

52:35.402 --> 52:36.820
Shut up.

52:36.904 --> 52:37.987
What?

52:38.072 --> 52:40.698
You're making a fool
out of yourself, Clairee.

52:40.783 --> 52:41.908
I am not.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.535
This is football.

52:43.619 --> 52:46.704
All the people want to hear about
is touchdowns and injuries.

52:46.789 --> 52:49.749
They don't give a damn
about that grape shit.

52:49.834 --> 52:53.628
We have this new psychiatrist
that comes in two days a week.

52:53.712 --> 52:57.173
Of course, I pick her name
out of the grab bag.

52:57.258 --> 53:01.094
I got to get her something.
Put that on the list.

53:01.178 --> 53:04.097
I have no idea
what to get your father.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.767
What's Jackson giving you?
Do you know?

53:07.852 --> 53:09.602
Furniture.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.689
Furniture? Well, my.

53:12.773 --> 53:16.860
Must be nice to be married
to a rich lawyer.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.945
What's it for,
the living room?

53:19.780 --> 53:21.781
No. For the nursery.

53:25.327 --> 53:27.745
We wanted to tell you

53:27.830 --> 53:30.039
when you and Daddy
were together, but
you're never together,

53:30.124 --> 53:33.084
so... it's every man
for himself.

53:35.004 --> 53:36.462
I'm pregnant.

53:39.842 --> 53:40.967
I realize that.

53:44.471 --> 53:46.222
Well, is that it?

53:46.307 --> 53:48.975
Is that all you're going to say?

53:50.352 --> 53:52.437
What do you want me to say?

53:53.606 --> 53:56.149
Well, something along the lines
of "congratulations."

53:58.903 --> 54:00.486
Congratulations.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.959
Would it be too much to ask...

54:16.587 --> 54:18.671
for a little excitement?

54:18.756 --> 54:21.966
Not too much.
I wouldn't want you to
break a sweat or anything.

54:27.431 --> 54:29.015
It's in July.

54:33.187 --> 54:34.687
Oh, Mama.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.690
You have to help me plan.

54:39.902 --> 54:41.736
We're going to get a new house.

54:41.820 --> 54:44.781
Jackson and I are going
house hunting next week.

54:44.865 --> 54:46.950
Jackson loves to hunt
for anything.

54:47.034 --> 54:49.285
What does Jackson say
about all this?

54:49.370 --> 54:50.995
He's so excited.

54:52.206 --> 54:54.415
He says he doesn't care
whether it's a boy or a girl,

54:54.500 --> 54:58.503
but I know he really wants a son
so bad he can taste it.

55:00.047 --> 55:04.342
He's really cute about the whole thing.
It's all he talks about...
Jackson Latcherie, Jr.

55:04.426 --> 55:05.802
Does he ever listen?

55:05.886 --> 55:09.180
I mean, when doctors
and specialists
give you advice,

55:09.264 --> 55:10.682
does he listen?

55:10.766 --> 55:12.725
I know you never do.
Does he?

55:15.354 --> 55:16.729
Huh?

55:17.815 --> 55:19.065
What?

55:20.567 --> 55:23.653
Well, I guess since
he doesn't have to carry the baby,

55:23.737 --> 55:25.989
it really isn't any of his concern.

55:26.073 --> 55:27.448
Mama.

55:28.993 --> 55:31.494
I want a child.

55:31.578 --> 55:34.789
What about adoption?
You filled out all the applications.

55:34.873 --> 55:37.458
Mama, no judge
is going to give a baby

55:37.543 --> 55:40.420
to someone
with my medical record.

55:41.797 --> 55:44.465
Jackson even put out feelers
about buying one.

55:44.550 --> 55:46.384
People do it all the time.

55:48.971 --> 55:50.763
Listen to me.

55:52.683 --> 55:54.767
I want a child of my own.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.191
I think it would help things a lot.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.036
I see.

56:25.799 --> 56:28.092
Mama, you worry too much.

56:29.428 --> 56:33.681
In fact, I never worry,
'cause I always know you're
worrying enough for both of us.

56:39.855 --> 56:42.231
Jackson and I have given this
a lot of thought.

56:42.316 --> 56:44.650
Has he really?
There's a first time
for everything.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.611
Don't start on Jackson,
Mama.

56:46.695 --> 56:49.197
Your poor body has
been through so much.

56:49.281 --> 56:51.157
Why deliberately
do this to yourself?

56:51.241 --> 56:53.701
Diabetics have healthy
babies all the time.

56:53.786 --> 56:55.161
You are special, Shelby.

56:55.245 --> 56:58.289
There are limits
to what you can do.

57:05.756 --> 57:07.340
I'm going to be...

57:08.342 --> 57:10.176
very, very careful.

57:11.303 --> 57:13.012
Nobody's going to be hurt

57:13.097 --> 57:16.099
or disappointed
or even inconvenienced.

57:16.892 --> 57:19.352
Least of all Jackson, I'm sure.

57:23.524 --> 57:24.774
You're jealous...

57:25.901 --> 57:28.611
because you no longer
have a say-so in what I do,

57:28.695 --> 57:30.947
and that drives you up the wall.

57:31.949 --> 57:36.452
You're ready to spit nails
because you can't call the shots.

57:36.537 --> 57:41.040
I did not raise my daughter
to talk to me like this.

57:43.043 --> 57:45.795
Yes, you did.
Oh, no, I didn't.

57:45.879 --> 57:50.133
Whenever any of us asked you
what you wanted for us
when we grew up, what did you say?

57:50.217 --> 57:52.635
I'm not in the mood
to play games.

57:52.719 --> 57:53.970
Just tell me what you said.

57:54.054 --> 57:57.723
The only thing I have ever said to you
is that I want you to be happy.

57:57.808 --> 58:01.144
Okay. The one thing that
would make me happy

58:01.228 --> 58:03.813
is to have a baby.

58:03.897 --> 58:07.859
If I could adopt one,
I would, but I can't.

58:09.194 --> 58:11.112
I'm going to have a baby,

58:11.196 --> 58:14.157
and I wish you'd be happy, too.

58:14.241 --> 58:17.201
I'll tell you what I wish.

58:18.871 --> 58:21.247
I don't know what I wish.

58:24.084 --> 58:27.420
Mama, I don't know why you have to
make everything so difficult.

58:29.673 --> 58:33.593
I look at having this baby
as the opportunity of a lifetime.

58:33.677 --> 58:36.095
Sure, there may be risk involved,

58:36.180 --> 58:39.098
but that's true for anybody.

58:39.183 --> 58:42.268
But you get through it,
and life goes on.

58:42.352 --> 58:45.229
When it's all said and done,
there'll be a little
piece of immortality

58:45.314 --> 58:49.150
with Jackson's good looks
and my sense of style, I hope.

58:49.234 --> 58:52.820
Please.

58:54.323 --> 58:56.324
I need your support.

58:58.452 --> 59:01.787
I would rather have
30 minutes of wonderful

59:01.872 --> 59:04.540
than a lifetime
of nothing special.

59:21.141 --> 59:23.935
Okay. All right.
I'm going to hand it to you.

59:24.019 --> 59:25.728
I don't want to hit you
upside the head.

59:25.854 --> 59:28.814
I got one hole left.
Right.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.816
Put the cords
behind the pole.

59:30.901 --> 59:32.443
If they show,
it'll look tacky.

59:32.527 --> 59:34.487
You told me about 40 times.

59:37.699 --> 59:39.617
Annelle, did you do all this?

59:39.701 --> 59:41.369
Guilty.

59:41.453 --> 59:45.081
Truvy just turned over
the decoration
responsibility to me.

59:45.165 --> 59:47.291
Look.
I went to the fire sale

59:47.376 --> 59:49.669
at the Baptist book store
in Shreveport last week.

59:49.753 --> 59:53.089
They had mismatched manger scenes
at incredibly low prices.

59:53.173 --> 59:55.091
I cleaned them out
of baby Jesuses,

59:55.175 --> 59:57.343
which I made into ornaments.

59:57.427 --> 59:58.427
She's ready to roll.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.304
Would you do the honors?

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.768
Yeah. Here you are,
Mrs. Latcherie.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:06.978
Thanks, Sammy.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.772

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.116

I think your elves
have gone berserk.

Well, Shelby,

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.706
I wasn't expecting to see you.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.666
What can I do for you?

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.210
I'm running a special
called a Christmas quickie.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:32.670
I'm beyond help.

the early stages of crow's feet.

Honey, time marches on.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.678
Eventually you realize
it's marching
across your face.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:41.721
Oh, no.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.389
It's Miss Ouiser.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.396
I'm supposed to give her
a pedicure today.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.356
I hate working
on her feet.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:54.233
It could have
been worse.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:56.819
She could have wanted
a bikini waxing.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.571
Let's not get graphic.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.655
Why not?

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:03.034
Miss Ouiser, I met
an old friend of yours.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.076
Oh?

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.578
Owen Jenkins.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:06.829
Oh.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:10.374
Owen. Now, there's
a blast from the past.

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:11.334
Do you remember him?

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:12.877
He remembers you.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:16.881
He had
the longest nose hair
in the free world.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:18.841
Now he hardly has
any hair anywhere.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:21.886
Owen's been gone
from Chinquapin Parish
since God was a boy.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:23.346
I'd forgotten he'd existed.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.223
He lives in Monroe
and goes to
First Presbyterian.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:29.518
He asked if I knew you.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.562
He used to live
in Ohio somewhere.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:35.024
His wife just died,
and he's moved back down here.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.652
Does this story have a point?

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.822
No, not really.
He just remembers you
fondly, I think.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.866
I can't imagine why.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:47.578
He was not a bad fellow,
but I managed
to run him off

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.914
and marry the first
of two total deadbeats.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.123
Maybe sometime
I could arrange

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.501
for us all
to get together.

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:54.502
Maybe not.

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:56.545
Why not?

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.714
Shelby, I managed
in a few decades

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:01.258
to marry the two
most worthless men
in the universe

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:05.971
and then proceeded to have
the three most ungrateful children
ever conceived.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:08.224
The only reason
people are nice to me

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:10.810
is because I have
more money than God.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.604
I'm not about to open
a new can of worms.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:14.814

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.232
What?

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:19.276
If this is how you feel,
it isn't healthy.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:21.904
Maybe you should come
to the guidance center

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.823
and talk to someone.
We're there to help.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.408
I'm not crazy, M'Lynn.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.867
I've just been

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:30.121

for 40 years.

Oh, look at you.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.505
Is that new?

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.008
I made the dress
with my own two hands.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.969
I just threw
the rest together.

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:48.472
The only thing
that separates us
from the animals

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:50.474
is our ability
to accessorize.

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:51.517
Oh.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.936
Annelle,
why are you so late?

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.481
Did you and Sammy
get tangled up in the tinsel?

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.316
Truvy. You kill me.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:00.401

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:10.536
They're family,

out of cream cheese.

I'm surprised at you

your kin that way.

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.339

always said,

nice about anybody,

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.260

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.965
and change my name
to Elizabeth Arden.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:25.679
Amen.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.391
Annelle, I'm going to
need more cuticle oil.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:30.601
Is it still next...

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:31.894
Second shelf.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.396
Was she praying?

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.772
Yes.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:36.607
Why?

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:40.152
Got me. Maybe she was praying
for Marshall and Drew and Belle.

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:43.572
Maybe for us
'cause we were gossiping.

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:46.241
Maybe because
the elastic's shot
in her panty hose.

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.077
She's prays at the drop
of a hat these days.

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:50.579
How long has she
been this way?

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:51.705
Since Mardi Gras.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:55.709
She had her choice of
going to a Bible weekend

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:59.296
or to New Orleans with me
and two other sinners.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.048
What does her boyfriend say?

01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:02.841
Sammy's so confused,
he don't know whether

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:05.844
to scratch his watch
or wind his butt.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:08.430
He says he could deal
with another man,

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:13.602
but he's having trouble with the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:14.853
Ahem.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:18.982
Oh, well, does Marshall
have, you know, friends?

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:21.109
Well, we discussed that.

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:24.112
I asked him how he...
met people.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.114
In my day you could tell

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.116
by a man's carriage
and demeanor

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.619
which side his bread
was buttered on,

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.121
but in this day and age,
who knows?

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:36.124
I asked Marshall,
"How can you tell?"

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:39.169
And he said,
"All gay men have track lighting,

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:40.629
"and all gay men

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:43.799
are named
Mark, Rick or Steve."

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:46.802
Be a soft-spoken dog.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:48.136
Morning.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:51.139
What's so funny in there?

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:54.184
Clairee's just been telling us
this true story of track lighting.

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:55.894
Oh, I love mine.

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:58.981
Highlights my new art work.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:02.150
Since when do you
have track lighting?

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.694
About three weeks.

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:07.239
It's in the foyer
up the staircase.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.157
My grandson's idea.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:10.742
I haven't seen him in ages.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.494
How is he?

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:13.662
Steve's fine.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:17.749
Shelby.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:21.503
Oh, God.
Your hair is so short.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:24.506
Why are you in such a good mood?

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.342
Did you run over
a small child or something?

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:28.510
Tomatoes.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.387
Don't give all these to me.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.180
Somebody's got to take them.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:35.976
I try not to eat healthy food
if I can possibly help it.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.603
The sooner my body gives out,
the better off I'll be.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:42.024
I can't get enough grease
into my diet.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.692
Why do you grow them?

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.610
Because I'm
an old Southern woman.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:50.657
We're supposed to wear
funny-looking hats and ugly clothes
and grow vegetables in the dirt.

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:54.202
Don't ask me
those questions.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:57.581
I don't know why.
I don't make the rules.

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:01.043
[Burp]

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:03.045
Oh, now, that's attractive,
Ouiser.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.259
Hmm. Shelby.

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:12.888
Oh, honey, what have
you done to yourself?

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.723
It doesn't hurt.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:17.184
M'Lynn, have you seen this?

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.188
Yes, I have.

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:25.233
The doctor's just trying
to strengthen my veins.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:26.568
They're in terrible shape.

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:27.819
My God.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.490
It looks like you've been
driving nails up your arms.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.742
What is going on?

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:36.161
Shall we tell them, Mama?

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:44.086
Well, I guess we can't
keep it a secret any longer.

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:47.672
Shelby has been
driving nails up her arm.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:51.426
It's my dialysis.

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.011
It's no big thing.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:57.265
Don't look at me like that.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.601
Having Jack, Jr.
Put too much strain
on my kidneys.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.479
Now they're kaput,
that's all.

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.648
The doctor said this
would probably happen.

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:06.233
That's all?

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:08.110
That's all, she says.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:11.238
Do you do this dialysis forever?

01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:13.532
Well, I could, I suppose,

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:16.243
but it's not real convenient
when you're trying to keep up with Jack, Jr.,

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:19.329
so I'll have a kidney transplant,
I'll be fine.

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:21.665
Is it that easy?
Sure.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:25.127
They do three or four
a week in Shreveport.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:29.131
They do.
Our Sunday school class was just
praying for one the other day.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:32.175
The hard part's finding
the kidney, isn't it?

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.679
I saw something about it on TV...
very dramatic.

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:38.682
These medical teams
fly all over the place,

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:41.726
taking hearts, kidneys,
and who knows what else.

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:42.936
What impressed me most

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.481
was they carry those organs
in beer coolers.

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:48.358
Stop it.

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:49.818
Those doctors take out
their six-packs,

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:53.155
throw in dry ice and a heart,
and get on a plane.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:55.699
How long do you have to
wait for one?

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:59.244
There are people on dialysis
that have been waiting for years.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:01.997
That must be agony.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.749
Well, I suppose, but I'm lucky.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.710
I don't have to wait anymore.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:11.089
Mama's going to give me
one of her kidneys.

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:14.759
When?

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:16.970
We check in
tomorrow morning.

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:29.357
So you better get going on my nails.

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:30.901
Annelle, I'm dripping.

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:32.068
Sorry.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.156
I shouldn't have said that.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.824
Said what?

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:39.284
Back at Truvy's.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:43.788
When I said I'd be better off
when my body wears out.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:47.292
I shouldn't have said that
in front of Shelby.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.793
I didn't mean that.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:52.172
Ouiser, nobody pays
any attention to you.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.841
But I feel bad, Clairee.

01:15:54.926 --> 01:15:57.052
I'm a terrible person.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:59.137
No, you're not.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:03.183
You'd give your dog a kidney
if he needed one.

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:05.644
Yes.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.987
Clairee,
this is just a gesture.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:19.532
We're not feeding Drum
till the end of time.

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:23.536
Drum loves pork and beans.
He eats them with everything.

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:25.330
That explains a lot.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:30.335
You're supposed to
soak the red beans overnight.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.963
But we don't have overnight.

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:36.383
I wanted to take it to them
before they leave for the hospital.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.301
Let's cook something else.

01:16:38.386 --> 01:16:39.970
I bought all the stuff.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.514
It's in the "Freezes Beautifully"
section of my cookbook.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.267
I want to take something
that freezes beautifully.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.894
Then we'll make
red beans and rice.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:55.193
Sammy Dwayne DeSoto,
what is this in my Frigidaire?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:58.697
Beer.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.951
I don't care what you do
in your refrigerator,

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.704
but you will not
keep liquor in mine.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:11.876
Oh, Annelle, for Christ's sakes.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.753
Who?

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:15.338
Christ.

01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:18.091
Who did you say?

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:20.135
Christ, Christ, Christ.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:22.262
Are you speaking of Our Lord?

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:24.264
Is that whose name
you're taking in vain?

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.141
That's the one.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:28.601
Well, I am sorry, Sammy,

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:31.271
but I'm not about spend
the next 50 years of my life

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:34.190
with someone who
I'm not gonna run into
in the hereafter.

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.151
Annelle, goddamn it!

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:38.737
I think we should pray.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.864
Oh, I'd rather eat dirt.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:45.869
Shelby says her half
of the operation's easy.

01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:47.912
I guess M'Lynn's is terrible.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.957
They basically have
to saw her in half

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:52.959
to get the kidney out.

01:17:53.044 --> 01:17:56.963
Well, they always do it
on Circus of the Stars.

01:17:57.048 --> 01:17:59.007
Don't joke about it, Spud.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:01.301
I feel awful for 'em.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:02.969
Yeah, well.

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:07.557
I guess the Eatentons
are lucky.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:11.561
They all know how much
they mean to each other.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.021
Maybe I'm jealous.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:16.024
Hand me that socket wrench,
would you?

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:18.068
Which one's a socket wrench?

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:20.904
The socket wrench,
the socket wrench.

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:22.072
This funny-looking thing?

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.156
Thank you.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:32.874
That's not funny.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.876
Okay, no more transplant jokes.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.419
Daddy doesn't like them.

01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:37.879
Whose turn is it?

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:39.214
Oh, Mama.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:40.548
Oh, yes?

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.050
Give me all your...

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.927
internal organs.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:46.179
Oh, I mean aces.

01:18:46.263 --> 01:18:48.515
Gosh, Dad, I-I'm sorry.

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:49.516
Yeah.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.017
It just slipped out.

01:18:51.102 --> 01:18:52.060
Go fish.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.938
I'm going to put
this little one to bed.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:56.523
Mama, I'll do it.

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:58.066
No, no, no. Let me.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.486
After tomorrow
it'll be a long time
before I can pick him up again.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.488
So much for the card game.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:04.447
Movie!
Movie!

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:06.491
It's old,
in black and white.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.951
Nothing dirty there.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:09.994
I got it, a classic...

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:12.080
A Tale of Two Kidneys.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:14.082
That's funny.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.417
You think that's funny?

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:16.418
Yes.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:17.919
That's not funny.

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.003
Oh.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.091
I overslept 'cause I was
up late cooking.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:26.594
I've got to get these beans
to the Eatentons,

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:29.597
and it's my Sunday
to count the offering.

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:31.599
I just know I'm gonna miss church.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:34.602
Cool down.
I'll have to turn the hose on you.

01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:01.719
Call Connolly's Funeral Home.

01:34:01.803 --> 01:34:03.304
That's the nicest.

01:34:09.436 --> 01:34:10.728
Jackson.

01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:16.525
You're going to have
to get her pink suit,

01:34:16.609 --> 01:34:20.654
the one with
the little red cherries
on the lapel?

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:25.784
Where's Jack, Jr?

01:34:25.869 --> 01:34:27.453
Aunt Fern's.

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:14.541
Here's your grandma.

01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:27.805
There you go.

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:30.391
Pumpkin.

01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:35.229
Jackson.

01:35:59.712 --> 01:36:02.673
Does this tie go?

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.844
Yeah.

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:11.515
You look real nice.

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:15.436
I'll come with you to the funeral
if you don't mind.

01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:18.522
I don't mind.

01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:34.204
I feel sorry for them, you know?

01:36:35.582 --> 01:36:37.583
I mean, especially Jackson...

01:36:39.836 --> 01:36:42.045
Iosing Shelby like that.

01:36:45.842 --> 01:36:48.844
If something like that
ever happened to me,
I don't know...

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:53.140
I don't know what I'd do.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:03.108
A thing like this just
doesn't make any sense.

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:06.320
No sense at all.

01:37:06.404 --> 01:37:09.656
I just keep thinking
about what Annelle says.

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:13.076
"The Lord works in mysterious ways."

01:37:14.287 --> 01:37:16.413
What the hell is this for?

01:37:17.916 --> 01:37:19.666
It makes you pretty.

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:17.743
Hey.

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:19.703
Come on home, honey.

01:39:37.096 --> 01:39:39.598
How you holding up, honey?

01:39:42.018 --> 01:39:43.393
I'm fine.

01:39:44.771 --> 01:39:47.731
It was a beautiful service.

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:50.776
The flowers were
the most beautiful flowers

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.861
I have ever seen.

01:39:52.945 --> 01:39:55.364
They were beautiful.

01:39:56.949 --> 01:39:58.325
Miss M'Lynn?

01:39:58.409 --> 01:40:01.495
It should make you
feel a lot better

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:04.581
that Shelby is with her king.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:08.877
Yes, Annelle, I guess it should.

01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:11.922
We should all be rejoicing.

01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:13.215
You go on ahead.

01:40:13.299 --> 01:40:15.384
I'm sorry if I don't feel like it.

01:40:15.468 --> 01:40:16.843
I guess I'm a little selfish.

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:18.595
I'd rather have her here.

01:40:21.307 --> 01:40:22.724
Miss M'Lynn...

01:40:23.893 --> 01:40:27.479
I don't mean to upset you
by saying that.

01:40:29.107 --> 01:40:31.149
It's just that...

01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:34.069
when something
like this happens,

01:40:34.153 --> 01:40:35.529
I pray very hard

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:39.199
to make heads
or tails of it, and...

01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:42.202
and I think that in Shelby's case,

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:46.039
she just wanted to take care
of that little baby

01:40:46.124 --> 01:40:50.127
and of you,
of everybody she knew.

01:40:50.211 --> 01:40:53.046
And her poor little body
was just worn out.

01:40:53.798 --> 01:40:58.051
It just wouldn't let her do
all the things she wanted to.

01:40:58.136 --> 01:41:01.054
So she went on to a place

01:41:01.139 --> 01:41:04.015
where she could
be a guardian angel.

01:41:05.184 --> 01:41:07.477
She will always be young,

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:10.480
she will always be beautiful.

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:15.402
And I personally feel much safer
knowing she's up there on my side.

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:21.491
It may sound
real simple and stupid,

01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.160
and maybe I am,

01:41:23.244 --> 01:41:26.955
but that's how I get
through things like this.

01:41:31.085 --> 01:41:33.128
Thank you, Annelle.

01:41:37.467 --> 01:41:39.468
I appreciate that.

01:41:41.012 --> 01:41:43.805
And it's a real good idea.

01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:48.393
Shelby wouldn't want us
to get mired down
and wallow in this.

01:41:48.478 --> 01:41:52.314
We should handle it
the best way we know how

01:41:52.398 --> 01:41:53.857
and get on with it.

01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:57.277
That's what my mind says.

01:41:58.529 --> 01:42:02.032
I wish somebody
would explain it to my heart.

01:42:02.116 --> 01:42:04.868
Drum says you never left her side
for a second.

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:07.454
No...

01:42:07.538 --> 01:42:10.457
I couldn't leave my Shelby.

01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:13.460
I just sat there
and kept on pushing

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:16.963
the way I always have
where Shelby was concerned.

01:42:17.048 --> 01:42:21.593
I was hoping she'd
sit up and argue with me.

01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:26.473
And finally we realized
there was no hope.

01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:30.352
We turned off the machines.

01:42:32.355 --> 01:42:34.356
Drum left.
He couldn't take it.

01:42:35.566 --> 01:42:36.900
Jackson left.

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:42.322
I find it amusing.

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:46.868
Men are supposed to be
made out of steel or something.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.581
But I just sat there.

01:42:53.125 --> 01:42:56.002
I just held Shelby's hand.

01:42:58.422 --> 01:43:00.507
There was no noise...

01:43:01.551 --> 01:43:02.843
no tremble...

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:05.929
just... peace.

01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:11.434
Oh, God.

01:43:11.519 --> 01:43:16.481
I realize, as a woman,
how lucky I am.

01:43:17.567 --> 01:43:18.984
I was there

01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:23.071
when that wonderful creature
drifted into my life,

01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:25.824
and I was there
when she drifted out.

01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:29.411
It was the most
precious moment of my life.

01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:37.919
I got to get back.

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:40.380
Does anybody got a mirror?

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:43.633
Does anybody have a mirror?

01:43:43.718 --> 01:43:46.553
I don't know how you're doing
on the inside, honey,

01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:49.389
but your hair
is just holding up beautiful.

01:43:51.684 --> 01:43:55.770
Oh... Shelby was right.

01:43:58.065 --> 01:44:00.692
This is a brown football helmet.

01:44:00.776 --> 01:44:02.485
Honey, are you okay?

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:06.239
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:44:06.324 --> 01:44:08.491
I'm fine!

01:44:09.535 --> 01:44:12.662
I can jog all the way
to Texas and back,

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:16.166
but my daughter can't.

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.209
She never could.

01:44:18.294 --> 01:44:21.421
God! I'm so mad,
I don't know what to do.

01:44:21.505 --> 01:44:22.464
I want to know why.

01:44:22.548 --> 01:44:25.508
I want to know why
Shelby's life is over.

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:27.761
I want to know how
that baby will ever know

01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:30.263
how wonderful his mother was.

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:33.892
Will he ever know
what she went through for him?

01:44:33.976 --> 01:44:37.437
Oh, God, I want to know why!

01:44:37.521 --> 01:44:39.147
Why?

01:44:39.231 --> 01:44:41.983
Lord, I wish I could understand.

01:44:42.068 --> 01:44:45.278
No! No! No!

01:44:45.363 --> 01:44:47.280
It's not supposed
to happen this way.

01:44:47.365 --> 01:44:48.823
I'm supposed to go first.

01:44:48.908 --> 01:44:51.493
I've always been ready to go first.

01:44:51.577 --> 01:44:55.664
I don't think I can take this.
I don't think I can take this.

01:44:55.748 --> 01:44:58.625
I just want to hit somebody
till they feel as bad as I do.

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:02.295
I just want to hit something!
I want to hit it hard!

01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:04.923
Here!

01:45:05.007 --> 01:45:06.383
Hit this!

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:08.301
Go ahead, M'Lynn.
Slap her!

01:45:08.386 --> 01:45:09.469
Are you crazy?

01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:10.345
Hit her!

01:45:10.429 --> 01:45:12.263
Are you high, Clairee?

01:45:12.348 --> 01:45:13.890
Have you lost your mind?

01:45:13.975 --> 01:45:17.686
We'll sell T-shirts saying,
"I slapped Ouiser Boudreaux."

01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:18.812
Hit her!

01:45:18.896 --> 01:45:21.272
Miss Clairee, enough.

01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:25.485
Ouiser, this is your chance
to do something for your fellow man.

01:45:25.569 --> 01:45:27.821
Knock her lights out, M'Lynn!

01:45:27.905 --> 01:45:29.364
Let go of me!

01:45:29.448 --> 01:45:30.699
You missed your chance.

01:45:30.783 --> 01:45:34.995
Half of Chinquapin Parish
would give their eyeteeth
to take a whack at Ouiser!

01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:38.540
[All Laughing]

01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:41.084
Oh.

01:45:45.423 --> 01:45:47.507
You are a pig from hell!

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:53.680
Ouiser, don't leave!

01:45:53.764 --> 01:45:58.059
Ouiser, Ouiser, I was just kidding.
Come back. Oh.

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:03.773
Not a very Christian
thing to do.

01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:07.610
Oh. Annelle,
you got to lighten up.

01:46:43.981 --> 01:46:45.648
Go away.

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:49.152
Okay, all right, hit me then.
I deserve it.

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:51.905
You are evil,
and you must be destroyed.

01:46:51.989 --> 01:46:55.408
Mother Nature's
taking care of that
faster than you could.

01:46:55.493 --> 01:46:59.913
Things were getting
entirely too serious for a moment.
We needed to laugh.

01:47:01.207 --> 01:47:04.084
I bet Lloyd got a kick out of it.

01:47:04.168 --> 01:47:09.464
Lloyd got a great deal
of enjoyment at my expense
when he was alive.

01:47:09.548 --> 01:47:13.968
Ouiser, you know I love you
more than my luggage.

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.854
All right.

01:47:26.482 --> 01:47:28.817
This is my bench!

01:47:28.901 --> 01:47:30.944
Get off my bench!

01:47:31.028 --> 01:47:33.947
Get off my... Good.

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:37.200
You are too twisted
for color TV, Clairee.

01:47:38.244 --> 01:47:40.036
Have your roots done.

01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:47.460
I shouldn't have
gone on the way I did.

01:47:47.545 --> 01:47:49.462
I made everybody cry.
Sorry.

01:47:49.547 --> 01:47:50.630
Don't be silly.

01:47:50.714 --> 01:47:54.801
Laughter through tears
is my favorite emotion.

01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:58.429
Maybe I should have
an emotional outburst
more often.

01:47:58.514 --> 01:48:00.557
Maybe I should start
having them at home.

01:48:00.641 --> 01:48:02.475
Drum would be so pleased.

01:48:06.522 --> 01:48:09.899
I'm glad to see
the two of you made up.

01:48:09.984 --> 01:48:12.402
Ouiser could never
stay mad at me.

01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:15.321
She worships
the quicksand I walk on.

01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:22.162
M'Lynn...
you're in my prayers, honey.

01:48:29.211 --> 01:48:31.963
Yes, Annelle, I pray.

01:48:33.299 --> 01:48:35.508
Well, I do.
There, I said it.

01:48:35.593 --> 01:48:36.718
I hope you're satisfied.

01:48:36.802 --> 01:48:39.179
I suspected this all along.

01:48:39.263 --> 01:48:42.849
Don't you expect me to come
to one of your churches,

01:48:42.933 --> 01:48:47.353
those tent revivals
with all those Bible beaters
doing God only knows what.

01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:50.398
They'd probably make me
eat a live chicken.

01:48:50.482 --> 01:48:53.234
Not on your first visit.

01:48:53.319 --> 01:48:54.861
Very good, Annelle.

01:48:54.945 --> 01:48:58.114
Spoken like a true smart ass.

01:49:02.203 --> 01:49:04.204
Oh, what are you doing?

01:49:04.288 --> 01:49:06.080
Are you eating my picture?

01:49:17.134 --> 01:49:18.801
Let's play on the swing.

01:49:18.886 --> 01:49:20.511
Get our feets in.

01:49:20.596 --> 01:49:21.971
There we go.

01:49:22.056 --> 01:49:25.558
Hold on.

01:49:25.643 --> 01:49:26.559
Ahh.

01:49:26.644 --> 01:49:28.144
Hold on.

01:49:31.023 --> 01:49:35.401
Miss M'Lynn,
I don't know if this is
the right time or place,

01:49:35.486 --> 01:49:39.155
but I wanted to tell you
that Sammy and I have decided

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:42.075
that if this baby's a girl,

01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:44.118
we'd like to name it Shelby,

01:49:44.203 --> 01:49:47.288
since she was the reason
we met in the first place.

01:49:47.373 --> 01:49:48.998
If you don't mind.

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:51.292
Shelby would love that.

01:49:52.294 --> 01:49:54.462
I'm tickled pink.

01:49:56.715 --> 01:49:58.091
Pink.

01:49:58.175 --> 01:50:02.095
What are you going to name it
if it happens to be a boy?

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:05.098
Shelby, I guess.

01:50:05.182 --> 01:50:07.517
That's how it should be.

01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:10.520
Life goes on.

01:50:47.766 --> 01:50:51.728
I've never been so uncomfortable
in all my life.

01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:56.232
We'll talk about uncomfortable
when you're nine months pregnant, okay?

01:50:58.193 --> 01:51:01.321
Keep those eyes closed, woman,
or I'm going to staple them shut.

01:51:01.405 --> 01:51:03.239
They're closed.
What is it?

01:51:03.324 --> 01:51:04.741
Okay. Now?

01:51:04.825 --> 01:51:05.700
Ready?

01:51:05.784 --> 01:51:07.076
Yeah.

01:51:07.911 --> 01:51:09.329
Keep them shut.

01:51:09.413 --> 01:51:10.747
Okay. Open them up.

01:51:10.831 --> 01:51:12.498
All right.

01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:16.169
I don't believe it!

01:51:16.253 --> 01:51:19.839
I'm a chain!
Oh, Spud, oh!

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.343
Jesus.

01:51:23.427 --> 01:51:24.844
Oh, lighten up.

01:51:24.928 --> 01:51:27.722
Now, you just burst
through those bushes

01:51:27.806 --> 01:51:30.892
and hop over
to where the kids are.

01:51:30.976 --> 01:51:33.353
What bushes?
I can't see shit.

01:51:33.437 --> 01:51:35.188
Over there.

01:51:35.272 --> 01:51:38.733
I'm an adult,
I'm not a five-year-old.

01:51:38.817 --> 01:51:41.819
On your mark, get set, go!

01:51:41.904 --> 01:51:42.945
Come on.

01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:47.200
Okay, Jack, Jr.,
I'm going to tell you a story.

01:51:48.619 --> 01:51:50.536
Once upon a time,

01:51:50.621 --> 01:51:54.540
there was a beautiful
young gal named Shelby.

01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:57.502
And Shelby had a lovely,

01:51:57.586 --> 01:52:03.549
kind and wonderful good fairy
named Clairee.

01:52:04.635 --> 01:52:08.221
But there was also a horrible, evil,

01:52:08.305 --> 01:52:11.724
ugly witch named Ouiser.

01:52:11.809 --> 01:52:14.727
I hate these stupid
neighborhood things.

01:52:14.812 --> 01:52:17.563
No one's twisting your arm
to keep you here.

01:52:17.648 --> 01:52:20.066
Well, I have to be sociable.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.069
Hey, Rhett's here!

01:52:25.364 --> 01:52:27.031
Let's connect the bald spots.

01:52:27.116 --> 01:52:28.282
Drum?

01:52:28.367 --> 01:52:29.242
Hmm?

01:52:29.326 --> 01:52:30.785
Eat shit and die.

01:52:30.869 --> 01:52:32.078
Hello, M'Lynn.

01:52:32.162 --> 01:52:34.414
Ouiser. Owen.

01:52:34.498 --> 01:52:35.957
Good to see you, too,
Ouiser, Owen.

01:52:36.041 --> 01:52:37.834
[Woof Woof Woof]

01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:40.586
Come on, Rhett.
Kill! Kill!

01:52:40.671 --> 01:52:43.798
Quit it, Drum!
Stop egging him on.

01:52:43.882 --> 01:52:45.341
Arrr!

01:52:47.177 --> 01:52:51.264
And everyone lived
happily ever after.

01:52:51.348 --> 01:52:55.685
And the nasty,
wicked, evil, wretched,

01:52:55.769 --> 01:52:58.062
horrible, mean Ouiser

01:52:58.147 --> 01:53:01.190
was never heard from again.

01:53:01.275 --> 01:53:04.235
Now, it's almost time
for the Easter Bunny.

01:53:04.319 --> 01:53:07.155
Run on down, hmm?

01:53:07.239 --> 01:53:08.531
Here!

01:53:13.871 --> 01:53:15.746
Shh.

01:53:21.253 --> 01:53:22.503
Ha ha ha!

01:53:22.588 --> 01:53:24.297
Hi, Jack.
You remember me?

01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:25.965
It's your old pal Ouiser.

01:53:26.049 --> 01:53:28.009
[Jack Crying]

01:53:29.553 --> 01:53:30.344
Aah! Jack!

01:53:30.429 --> 01:53:32.680
This isn't like Jackson.

01:53:32.764 --> 01:53:34.974
Jack, come here.

01:53:42.941 --> 01:53:44.609
Oh, Jack.

01:53:44.693 --> 01:53:46.152
Is he all right?

01:53:46.236 --> 01:53:48.362
Oh, yes, he's all right.

01:53:55.412 --> 01:53:57.121
Ohh.

01:53:57.206 --> 01:54:00.166
Oh, Truvy!

01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:02.919
Oh, honey. It's okay, it's okay.

01:54:03.003 --> 01:54:04.962
Women have babies
every day. M'Lynn.

01:54:05.047 --> 01:54:05.922
Jonathan, quick.

01:54:06.006 --> 01:54:08.758
Get that Easter Bunny
over here now!

01:54:08.842 --> 01:54:10.259
Hey, Tommy, where's Sammy?

01:54:10.344 --> 01:54:11.302
Over there.

01:54:11.386 --> 01:54:12.512
Why? What's going on?

01:54:12.596 --> 01:54:14.263
What's... Oh, my God!

01:54:14.348 --> 01:54:16.307
She's going to have a baby!

01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:18.017
Go get a doctor.

01:54:18.101 --> 01:54:18.893
A doc... Help!

01:54:18.977 --> 01:54:21.187
This way! This way!

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:22.813
This way. Come on.

01:54:22.898 --> 01:54:25.942
Through here.
Come on. Get her in.

01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:31.906
It's all right, honey.
We'll get Sammy.

01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:34.283
Easy, easy.

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:41.374
Bye-bye.

01:54:41.458 --> 01:54:44.460
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.714
Come on, Sammy!

01:54:49.967 --> 01:54:51.759
Get your tail hopping!
