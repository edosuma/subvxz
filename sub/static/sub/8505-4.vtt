00:07.967 --> 00:09.552
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.635 --> 00:10.678
The Arena Club?

00:10.761 --> 00:12.430
What the hell
have you gotten yourself into, Peg?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.515
I don't know. But at least
I know where to start looking.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.058
<i>I want to plant
listening devices</i>

00:16.142 --> 00:17.685
<i>in the club and let them
incriminate themselves.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:19.020
You and Peggy make a great team.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.938
I'm happy to help out Miss Carter
in any way I can.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.443
Look. Peggy...

00:25.526 --> 00:26.986
No, don't touch me.
I've seen this before.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.280
This is a side effect of Zero Matter.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.366
Mr Stark's process would make
all invisible wavelengths visible.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.076
Dr Wilkes.
Why can't I touch him?

00:34.160 --> 00:35.369
He's visible.
He's just not tangible.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.495
Am I dead?

00:36.579 --> 00:38.122
We thought so, but apparently not.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.248
Meet Agnes Cully.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.666
"Whitney Frost" is her stage name.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.711
America's sweetheart is
the brains behind Isodyne Energy.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.046
Oh, my God!

00:54.180 --> 00:57.391
I will slay you,
dragon, and save the princess.

01:01.020 --> 01:05.024
Now, fair maiden,
I will cut off the dragon's head.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.070
- Give it back.
- Here it is.

01:09.153 --> 01:10.780
Come on. Take it.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.239
Michael, give it to me.

01:17.703 --> 01:18.996
Margaret Elizabeth Carter!

01:22.333 --> 01:23.375
Come.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.712
You'll be the death of me, Peggy Carter.

01:26.796 --> 01:27.922
Oh...

01:29.131 --> 01:31.550
Where is my blasted handkerchief?

01:32.301 --> 01:33.511
Oh, go on. Have a laugh.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.555
But one of these days, you're going to
have to start behaving like a lady.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.269
Four...

01:44.855 --> 01:46.440
Oh, sorry.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.402
I'm starved.

01:52.363 --> 01:53.614
I miss food.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.158
Oh, yes. I hadn't thought of that.
Are you hungry?

01:56.242 --> 01:57.409
No.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.745
Well, I don't think so.

01:59.829 --> 02:02.456
I don't have any sense
of my body at all, actually.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.416
I'm numb.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.210
It's disconcerting.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.419
I wish I could be of more use

02:07.503 --> 02:09.672
in helping you find a way
to reverse your condition.

02:10.214 --> 02:13.592
Well, if spending time with you
is the by-product of my current state,

02:14.552 --> 02:16.554
I'd almost say it's worth it.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.014
Still, it must be very...

02:20.724 --> 02:22.685
Frustrating.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.187
You have no idea.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.779
- You were saying?
- Right.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.993
What we're looking at
is a design for a fast-neutron reactor.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.370
They built one like it
in Los Alamos last year,

02:41.453 --> 02:45.666
which, at full power,
could generate 25 kilowatts.

02:45.749 --> 02:46.792
Oh. Right.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.712
Three years before that, Agnes Cully...

02:49.795 --> 02:53.549
Or, as we know her, Whitney Frost,
patented this reactor

02:53.632 --> 02:56.844
that can theoretically generate
1,000 times more power.

02:57.553 --> 02:58.762
So she's a genius.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.764
I'm a genius.

03:01.432 --> 03:02.975
Whitney Frost...

03:03.809 --> 03:05.853
She defies categorisation.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.651
It's open.

03:12.943 --> 03:17.156
Miss Frost?
A package has just arrived for you.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.866
- Where would you like it?
- In here, Mabel.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.451
Beside the vanity is fine.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.539
Thank you. That'll be all.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.334
Something's moving in here.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.837
Thank you. That'll be all.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.761
Well...

04:21.470 --> 04:24.556
Mr Chadwick is inside,
but no sign of Miss Frost.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.393
Not a dead loss, though.
I did get you a button.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.727
Thank you.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.440
For the purposes of blending in,
Miss Carter.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.235
Whitney Frost isn't here.
She certainly isn't at work.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.153
No one's seen her
since her director disappeared.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.155
Well, perhaps she's still at her home.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.573
"Holed up," as they say.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.492
She and her husband
have gone to great lengths

04:43.575 --> 04:45.411
to hide her involvement in Zero Matter.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.414
Perhaps exposing her
is the key to exposing everything.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.499
Ah. Here's Mr Chadwick now.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.753
Oh, Hedy Lamarr is divorcing
husband number three.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.214
Be still my beating heart.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.466
Mr Jarvis, look at that driver's hand.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.303
Oh, what a coincidence.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.097
He's got the same wound you inflicted
on that attacker the other day.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.269
The Chadwicks appear to have built

05:10.352 --> 05:12.563
quite a formidable wall
around themselves.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.524
Well, it's high time
we put a crack in that wall.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.658
Got it. Thank you, Rose.
You are a wonder.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.749
The car is registered to Rufus Hunt.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.542
Served in the Philippines
during the war.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.794
Court-martialled,
dishonourably discharged

05:35.878 --> 05:37.421
for black market profiteering.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.340
Well, that's a career
that easily transitions to assassin,

05:39.423 --> 05:40.466
I would imagine.

05:40.549 --> 05:44.011
He is currently head of security
at the Arena Social Club,

05:44.094 --> 05:47.890
which means he quite likely has
access to all manner of secrets.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.933
Well, given our previous encounter,

05:50.017 --> 05:52.227
I'm not sure we can be certain
to divulge anything.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.897
- He nearly bested the both of us.
- Mmm, we'll have to be creative.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.192
Subdue him somehow without getting
our own necks wrung in the process.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.612
I may have just the thing.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.785
I trust you've operated
a tranquilliser rifle before.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.620
I can't say that I have.
Why on Earth have you?

06:09.912 --> 06:12.122
On occasion,
wrangling Mr Stark's animal preserve

06:12.206 --> 06:14.124
requires a ruthless hand.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.002
- Not the flamingo.
- The koala.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.046
Its adorable appearance
belies a vile temperament.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.255
Mmm.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.052
What are you feelings
on committing a felony, Mr Jarvis?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.721
In this case...

06:27.805 --> 06:29.139
Decidedly for.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.754
Look at this mess, Aggie.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.006
Uncle Bud's coming by any minute now.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.885
Mama, you've been complaining
about the broken radio for weeks.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.850
Get cleaned up, baby.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.436
You remember, be sweet to Uncle Bud.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.396
He's not my uncle.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.939
He's good to us.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.524
Weren't for him, we...

07:20.607 --> 07:24.403
Well, you're lucky
you have a mama takes care of you.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.157
- Hello, darlin'.
- Oh!

07:30.451 --> 07:32.119
Oh, sugar.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.913
I'll be damned
if you don't feel as firm as you look.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.709
Aww, sugar, I've been looking forward
to seeing you all day.

07:40.544 --> 07:41.879
What are you working on over there?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.881
- Oh.
- Playing with the radio?

07:47.634 --> 07:48.677
Whoop!

07:49.052 --> 07:51.472
You're not careful,
your face will stick like that, girl.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.224
Can I have my pencil back, please?

07:54.308 --> 07:57.019
I bet you're real pretty when you smile.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.062
Come on.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.148
Why don't you smile
for your Uncle Bud?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.902
Because I'm thinking.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.988
Got a real strange kid here, Wilma.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.782
Yes.

08:10.866 --> 08:14.161
Well, why don't you go on upstairs
and get comfy, sugar?

08:14.244 --> 08:15.537
- I'll be right up.
- Mmm.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.165
All right? Oh! Oh!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.252
I told you to be sweet.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.254
I don't like him, Mama.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.380
You hush up.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.382
You stay out of my hair
for the next couple hours.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.343
Clean up this mess.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.319
- Just a minute.
- Whitney, are you in there?

09:32.489 --> 09:33.699
Yes.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.787
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm just running lines.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.913
I have a busy day.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.373
Assuming they find your director.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.458
Paper said he hadn't been heard from
since Tuesday.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.002
Well, Kenneth likes to drink.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.588
I wouldn't be surprised if
they found him floating in the reservoir.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.339
Hush. Don't say that.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.425
That'd be terrible for the campaign.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.261
Did you want something?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.513
Oh, the photographer called.

09:56.597 --> 10:00.017
He asked if you could wear
the white dress tonight.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.977
You know, the one with the, uh...

10:02.060 --> 10:03.145
- The neckline.
- The neckline?

10:04.396 --> 10:06.356
That was the one I was going to pick.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.359
It's not every day that <i>LIFE</i> magazine
wants to put you on the cover.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.945
We play our cards right, and you will be

10:12.029 --> 10:14.364
the most beautiful First Lady
this country's ever seen.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.158
Mmm, darling...

10:16.241 --> 10:18.410
No one deserves it more than you.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.578
Mmm.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.664
That's my beautiful girl.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.791
- We'll see you at 6:00?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.752
- Don't be late.
- No.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.620
Open up! This is the police!

11:45.789 --> 11:47.582
We know
you're in there, Hunt!

11:48.041 --> 11:49.876
Come out right now with your hands up!

11:53.714 --> 11:54.923
Oh...

11:56.174 --> 11:59.970
Ma'am, please go back to your domicile
and shut the door!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.099
And shut the door.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.643
Thank you.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.021
Oh!

12:10.105 --> 12:12.065
That's it, Hunt! Time's up!

12:12.149 --> 12:14.901
I'm gonna come in
and start squirting lead!

12:19.114 --> 12:20.157
Ohh!

12:20.449 --> 12:21.533
Oh!

12:21.616 --> 12:23.535
Remember me, Mr Hunt?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.709
Oh, for heaven's sake. That's enough
to take down a rhinoceros.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.070
Easy as pie.

13:02.616 --> 13:03.700
Mr Jarvis, are you all right?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.955
Jarvelous!

13:15.504 --> 13:17.506
This is not my lucky day.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.143
Ah! Chief Sousa, what brings you here?

13:30.227 --> 13:31.895
- Thompson called.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.397
He approved your vacation days,
but he's not very happy about it.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.441
Thank you so much
for coming to deliver the message.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.401
- I know you're very busy.
- That's not all.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.529
I dug a little deeper,
got some stats on Whitney Frost.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.405
Wonderful. Very good.
I will dive right into them...

13:42.489 --> 13:45.492
Agnes Cully got discovered in front of
the Olympic Movie House in '34.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.953
They gave her a flashy new name,
put her in the pictures.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.539
She became
Anvil Studios' top earner by '38.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.457
Fascinating. Is that in the file?

13:52.541 --> 13:54.960
I will read it directly.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.628
- You okay?
- Of course.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.880
Because I know when
somebody's trying to brush me off.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.799
Brushed?

14:00.882 --> 14:02.592
You?

14:04.970 --> 14:06.012
What happened to him?

14:06.096 --> 14:07.848
An overindulgence of drink.

14:14.187 --> 14:20.318
We... Caught a possum
on this property earlier this morning.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.279
Vicious little creature.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.197
Let me out of here!

14:24.906 --> 14:27.909
Or I have a man stashed in the boot.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.954
Hey! Let me out of here!

14:31.037 --> 14:32.747
- It's a felony!
- A felony? That's harsh.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.374
I can't even believe it!
What were you thinking?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.167
I was doing the best I could
in our opportunity.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.961
- I thought we were a team.
- We are a team.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.671
- A wonderful team.
- No, we're not a team.

14:39.754 --> 14:40.797
If we were a team

14:40.881 --> 14:42.424
and you were thinking about
pulling a stunt like this,

14:42.507 --> 14:43.550
you would've called me for backup.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.385
I did have backup.
Mr Jarvis was with me.

14:45.468 --> 14:48.847
Oh, Mommy, it's the biggest horsy ever.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.101
- He's also part of the team.
- Peggy, you kidnapped somebody.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.186
I had to give you
some plausible deniability.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.856
You've already faced enough blowback
from the SSR on my account.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.482
I've already ruined your proposal.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.942
If I can contain the mess
in the rest of your life,

15:01.026 --> 15:02.110
the better I'll sleep.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.779
Well, I'll sleep better
if you stop pushing me away

15:04.863 --> 15:06.072
and let me help you.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.872
So, what do you got planned
for Rufus Hunt?

15:15.332 --> 15:17.459
I was thinking I'd kill him.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.088
Look, Hunt,
you're not our priority.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.298
Obviously.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.634
Tell me about the work you do
for Calvin Chadwick

15:25.717 --> 15:27.260
and his buddies
at the Arena Social Club.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.386
Oh, is that all?

15:28.470 --> 15:30.263
I need names of members,
I need to know what they're up to,

15:30.347 --> 15:32.807
and I want to know
how Whitney Frost figures into all this.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.976
Club policy says
I ain't allowed to socialize

15:35.060 --> 15:37.646
with the members or their wives.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.065
You really want to do this the hard way?

15:43.193 --> 15:44.778
Did you get that leg in combat?

15:46.196 --> 15:48.615
- Bastogne.
- Europe.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.533
Cute.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.163
Look, you gonna smack me around
or break a couple fingers?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.082
Have at it.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.293
Because while you were playing
grab-ass on the continent,

16:00.377 --> 16:03.171
I was already playing this game
with the Japanese.

16:03.254 --> 16:06.174
They took these fingers
and tied them to a Jeep

16:06.257 --> 16:08.301
and dragged me around in circles.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.179
Once before breakfast,
once before lunch.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.806
And there wasn't no lunch.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.767
You're gonna get out of me
the same thing they got,

16:16.518 --> 16:17.811
which is squat.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.523
He's all yours.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.443
We're not going to torture you.

16:25.527 --> 16:26.861
Of course you're not.

16:26.945 --> 16:31.491
I know all about you, running around,
pretending you're Eliot Ness.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.451
See, and that's your problem, really.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.664
People on your side have a line
you just can't cross.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.291
I meant to say,
we're not going to torture you

16:40.375 --> 16:43.128
because... We don't have time.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.132
We thought
you'd run out of time, love.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.758
We started taking wagers
around the office

16:48.842 --> 16:50.301
that Fred would never pop the question.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.511
I bet he would.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.847
Someone owes me two quid.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.099
It might be me. I bet he wouldn't.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.226
All right, ladies, enough chatting.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.978
Back to your codes.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.439
Miss Carter, a word.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.232
Of course, Mr Edwards.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.824
I hear congratulations are in order.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.577
- Yes, I'm to be married.
- Lovely.

17:16.327 --> 17:20.582
Well, I hope you are ready
for another proposal.

17:23.001 --> 17:26.087
- What's SOE?
- Special Operations Executive.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.758
It's a new war division spearheaded
by Winston Churchill himself.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.385
- And they need a codebreaker?
- Codebreaker?

17:32.469 --> 17:33.845
Good heavens, no.

17:33.928 --> 17:37.974
They're being tasked to
train field agents in irregular warfare...

17:38.058 --> 17:40.769
Espionage, sabotage, guerrilla tactics.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.187
Field work?

17:42.937 --> 17:44.689
But they don't send women
into the field.

17:44.773 --> 17:48.151
Resistance networks all over Europe
need people who won't draw attention

17:48.234 --> 17:49.569
walking down the street.

17:49.652 --> 17:50.779
They need women.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.573
And they're recruiting you.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.743
Why? That is... Why me?

17:56.826 --> 18:00.288
Well, you're already an exceptional
codebreaker, Miss Carter.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.791
Someone must see
a great deal of potential in you.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.793
It's quite an honour to be tapped.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.253
Yes, uh... I see.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.881
I'm sorry, Mr Edwards.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.301
I don't believe
I'm meant to be in the field.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.221
This is a rare chance for you

18:16.304 --> 18:19.682
to strike a massive blow
for king and country.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.020
Yes, sir.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.858
I will discuss it with my fiancé.

18:30.693 --> 18:31.986
But I'm...

18:32.070 --> 18:34.614
I'm afraid I'm simply not cut out
for that kind of work.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.700
Ow!

18:39.077 --> 18:40.411
I was in the war, as well.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.413
And it taught me that people on my side

18:42.497 --> 18:45.291
sometimes need to blur the line
to stop people on your side.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.085
I've done my homework on you,
Mr Hunt.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.420
I know you served in the Pacific.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.298
That means
you'll recognise the effects of malaria.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.676
Malaria?

18:54.759 --> 18:56.219
A particularly virulent strain,

18:56.302 --> 18:59.055
developed from an avian parasite
by Stark Industries.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.143
There is an antidote,
but if you refuse to talk,

19:03.226 --> 19:04.269
why should I give it to you?

19:06.229 --> 19:08.648
I'm sure you'll need some time
to mull over our proposal.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.317
The toxin's effects become fatal
in 20 minutes.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.069
I'll be back in 10.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.573
Hey! Hey!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.366
Hey, get back in here!

19:18.449 --> 19:19.534
Hey!

19:20.368 --> 19:22.328
- That's one way to do it.
- Well, let's hope it works.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.289
What did you stick him with?

19:24.372 --> 19:26.624
Howard wanted to create a cure
for the common cold.

19:26.708 --> 19:27.792
He came up with a compound

19:27.876 --> 19:29.919
that brings on intense symptoms
in minutes.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.631
- You gave him a cold?
- An intense cold.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.091
Hey!

19:35.550 --> 19:37.010
Cup of tea?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.013
This is crazy.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.309
I had to hear it from Lorraine
down the street

19:44.392 --> 19:46.853
that you've been stepping out
with the Owens girl!

19:46.936 --> 19:48.855
She's hardly a year older than Agnes.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.690
I didn't plan it to happen.

19:50.773 --> 19:54.569
Don't get mad, sugar. You...
You're breaking my heart.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.113
- What heart, you lousy cheat?
- You got to understand, Wilma.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.281
Understand what?

19:58.364 --> 20:00.325
Wanting something young and pretty
to climb on top of?

20:00.408 --> 20:01.451
She's a woman.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.329
- She's good to me.
- Wasn't I good to you, Bud?

20:04.954 --> 20:06.623
Didn't we take care of one another?

20:10.835 --> 20:12.670
I want you out of here by tomorrow.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.923
You go to hell, Bud Schultz!

20:15.173 --> 20:17.467
You go straight to hell!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.442
You could've been nicer to him.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.695
I didn't like him.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.198
Oh.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.035
You think you're so damn smart.

20:51.626 --> 20:54.003
You really think that
that fancy science programme

20:54.087 --> 20:56.047
is gonna take a girl?

20:56.714 --> 20:59.092
It don't matter how smart you are.

20:59.509 --> 21:02.136
You're stuck here, same as me.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.890
I will still get out of here.
Away from you.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.519
- Come here!
- Mama!

21:14.357 --> 21:16.734
No one cares what's in your head.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.153
If you were half as smart
as you think you are,

21:19.237 --> 21:20.947
you'd fix on this.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.615
This is the only thing

21:22.699 --> 21:25.368
that's gonna get you
anywhere in this world.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.136
- Hello?
<i>- Whitney, you're an hour late.</i>

21:43.219 --> 21:46.139
I'm sorry, darling. I'm...
I'm not feeling well.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.017
<i>Well, can't you just pull yourself
together for an hour or so?</i>

21:49.100 --> 21:51.185
<i>What happened to
"the show must go on"?</i>

21:51.269 --> 21:53.646
<i>I'm afraid I won't be able to make it.</i>

21:53.730 --> 21:56.107
<i>Whitney, this is</i> LIFE <i>magazine.</i>

21:56.190 --> 21:58.109
<i>They're gonna cancel the cover story
if you're not involved.</i>

21:58.192 --> 21:59.485
<i>I just know it.</i>

21:59.569 --> 22:01.487
<i>It's your face they want, not...</i>

22:14.042 --> 22:15.251
One name, Hunt.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.253
Let's just start with one name.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.379
Please.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.714
You're impressive.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.382
At death's door.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.468
All you need to do to live
is to answer a few questions,

22:23.551 --> 22:25.386
and yet here you sit, silent.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.139
I can't tell if you're motivated
by strong convictions or spite.

22:28.222 --> 22:29.891
Peg...

22:31.809 --> 22:33.561
Want to pump the brakes
on him a little bit?

22:33.644 --> 22:34.729
He's got five minutes left.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.064
That's a generous estimation.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.231
He's no use to us dead.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.858
He's no use to us alive and quiet.

22:38.941 --> 22:39.984
Thomas Gloucester!

22:40.693 --> 22:41.736
The Wall Street guy.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.446
Hugh Jones.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.239
Roxxon. I've had the pleasure.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.783
Give me the antidote. Now.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.159
Not until we finish our conversation.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.535
Then you'll be clear and free to do as...

22:49.619 --> 22:53.581
Free?
I'll never be free again, not after this.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.792
This stuff's gonna buy me
a couple of days.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.502
You can get out of town, run.

22:57.585 --> 22:58.920
Or the SSR can protect you.

22:59.504 --> 23:02.298
Are you two really that dumb, huh?

23:02.882 --> 23:05.218
There's no running, no protection.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.845
You think the men I work for
are just criminals,

23:07.929 --> 23:10.098
like a... Like a stickup man?

23:10.390 --> 23:12.350
They're in everything!

23:12.975 --> 23:16.229
And what they can't buy, they destroy.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.439
President McKinley, Black Tuesday...

23:18.523 --> 23:20.483
You think those things just happened?

23:21.526 --> 23:23.820
Run?

23:23.903 --> 23:26.447
I'm already dead. And so are you.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.241
Do you want those extra days or not?

23:29.700 --> 23:30.743
Wait.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.706
Storage room.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.417
At the club.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.960
The Council of nine.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.504
That's what they're called.
They record their meetings.

23:41.587 --> 23:45.508
You'll see... Everything you want to know
about Calvin Chadwick

23:45.591 --> 23:46.801
and the rest of his crowd.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.386
It's on those tapes.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.891
Times "N" to the power of "P."

23:57.395 --> 23:58.813
Is that correct, Dr Wilkes?

23:58.896 --> 24:00.565
It is, Mr Jarvis. Thank you.

24:00.648 --> 24:01.941
Wonderful.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.235
What does it mean?

24:04.318 --> 24:06.112
It means I'm back at square one.

24:06.654 --> 24:09.282
My theory has been that
my atoms have lost cohesion

24:09.365 --> 24:12.160
at a quantum level, but...

24:12.743 --> 24:14.579
I think I've reached a dead end.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.003
Look, why don't we step
away from the task for a moment.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.880
We've been working for hours.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.008
Dr Wilkes?

24:27.091 --> 24:28.759
Dr Wilkes, are you quite well?

24:28.843 --> 24:30.344
Huh? Um...

24:32.680 --> 24:33.723
I'm fine.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.933
Uh, just got lost in my head a little.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.979
- Jarvis, where's the phone?
- It's on the desk.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.315
I take it
Mr Hunt fell for our little ruse.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.441
He certainly did.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.692
I got a buddy
at the US Attorney's Office.

24:44.775 --> 24:45.985
He'll get the judge to get the warrant.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.403
A warrant? For what?

24:47.487 --> 24:49.197
We're raiding the Arena Club.

24:50.281 --> 24:52.366
The minute we get the warrant,
we'll mobilise.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.452
When we get to the Arena Club,
we'll split into two teams.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.787
Team One will cover the offices,
gathering information.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.415
I want accounting information,
membership rosters, stuff like that.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.334
Team Two will go with Agent Carter

25:01.417 --> 25:03.377
through the hidden door
into the secret area of the club.

25:03.461 --> 25:04.504
That's right.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.589
He did say "hidden door"
and "secret area."

25:06.672 --> 25:08.174
We're dealing with odd rich men here.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.342
They love this sort of thing.

25:09.425 --> 25:10.885
Sousa.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.095
- What? What?
- What is it?

25:15.640 --> 25:16.682
You Chief Sousa?

25:17.099 --> 25:18.392
Yeah. Who wants to know?

25:18.476 --> 25:21.229
The man who signs your timecards.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.439
Vernon Masters, War Department.

25:23.648 --> 25:24.690
What can I do for you?

25:24.774 --> 25:27.026
Well, let's start
by putting these shotguns away.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.779
They're making this situation
a bit more tense than it needs to be.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.781
Sir, we're about to conduct a raid
on the Arena...

25:31.864 --> 25:33.074
Let's put that on the back burner.

25:33.157 --> 25:37.578
The War Department has decided
to audit this branch's cases,

25:37.662 --> 25:38.704
past and present.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.456
This is outrageous.

25:40.998 --> 25:44.293
Peggy, it's an executive order.
Comes straight from DC.

25:44.377 --> 25:47.547
So, if you'll just crack open your files,
we'll get to work,

25:47.630 --> 25:49.549
and I'm sure
this will all be done in no time.

25:50.091 --> 25:52.510
Chief, would you mind
showing my men around?

25:53.553 --> 25:54.595
Guys.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.223
After you.

25:58.099 --> 26:00.101
And you...

26:00.184 --> 26:03.312
Must be the Agent Carter
that I keep hearing so much about.

26:04.355 --> 26:07.483
Have I been dying to talk to you.

26:12.363 --> 26:15.449
We have credible information
implicating members of the Arena Club

26:15.533 --> 26:17.827
in a conspiracy
that involves numerous murders

26:17.910 --> 26:20.955
and experimental work
in a highly dangerous substance.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.333
There is no legitimate reason
to prevent the SSR enforcing the law,

26:24.417 --> 26:26.586
even on those
who believe they are above it.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.214
How are you enjoying your vacation,
Agent Carter?

26:30.506 --> 26:31.549
Vigorously.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.176
Jack Thompson thinks
very highly of you.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.721
He says that you're
quite the independent thinker.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.639
I'm sure he meant that as an insult.

26:38.723 --> 26:40.266
Perhaps.

26:40.850 --> 26:45.021
Times like these, it's often safer
to be seen as a team player.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.190
But you... Don't seem like
the type of lady

26:48.274 --> 26:50.067
who plays anything safe.

26:51.152 --> 26:53.154
That's a compliment, by the way.

26:53.237 --> 26:57.116
Allowing these men to escape scrutiny
is the very definition of playing it safe.

26:57.408 --> 26:58.451
According to our source,

26:58.534 --> 27:00.745
their influence reaches
well beyond the Isodyne cover-up.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.997
Mmm... How so?

27:03.080 --> 27:06.167
Assassinations, market manipulation...

27:06.250 --> 27:08.127
We won't know
the full extent of the Council's power

27:08.210 --> 27:09.920
until we pry open their secrets.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.215
Hmm.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.301
Who is this source?

27:16.010 --> 27:18.721
We're keeping his name confidential
for his own safety.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.097
Bring him in.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.641
I'd like to vet him personally.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.726
Chief Sousa and I signed an affidavit,

27:23.809 --> 27:25.603
vouching for his credibility as a CI.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.396
That's more than sufficient
for a warrant.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.106
Not this time.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.193
Who is he?

27:36.405 --> 27:38.658
You're refusing to reveal his identity?

27:38.949 --> 27:40.868
Call it independent thinking.

27:40.951 --> 27:44.872
You know, the Hollywood Ten thought
they were independent thinkers, too.

27:44.955 --> 27:48.292
A communist witch hunt has
no relevance to the work of the SSR.

27:48.376 --> 27:50.252
But it should be relevant to you.

27:50.795 --> 27:54.006
A spy who isn't even American.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.928
A tidal wave is coming, Agent Carter.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.849
And you are going to have to work
very hard to stay afloat.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.185
I'll manage.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.062
Maybe so.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.983
But your friends could still drown.

28:33.170 --> 28:36.465
A toast, to my two favourite men,
meeting at last.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.050
Cheers.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.720
Come on, Peggy. Slug it back.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.346
You won't beat
your older brother this time.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.640
- I've been practising.
- Michael, not here.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.809
You can do that?

28:46.892 --> 28:49.979
Not recently.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.525
So, uh, Michael, tell me...
How goes it at the front?

28:54.608 --> 28:56.235
Well, there are lots of Nazis there,

28:56.318 --> 28:58.237
and they tend to shoot at you
a great deal.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.907
Apart from that, the scenery is splendid.

29:01.991 --> 29:05.411
Do let me know if there's anything
you feel the Home Office isn't providing.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.455
I have a direct line to command.

29:07.997 --> 29:11.000
Consider me your personal concierge.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.294
That's very kind of you, Fred.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.382
Did I tell you
I was recruited to be a spy?

29:18.466 --> 29:21.427
We turned them down, of course.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.304
Did we?

29:24.054 --> 29:25.389
Can you imagine?

29:25.473 --> 29:27.391
Risking life and limb
behind enemy lines,

29:27.475 --> 29:29.185
doing God knows what there.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.437
That's not our Peg.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.731
Hmm.

29:33.814 --> 29:36.233
One thing I've learned from the war...

29:36.650 --> 29:39.445
A boring life is a privilege.

29:43.199 --> 29:45.326
- I'll get us a top-up, hmm?
- Mmm.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.372
So?

29:51.332 --> 29:52.416
What do you think?

29:52.833 --> 29:55.252
What does it matter what I think?
You're the one marrying him.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.838
Of course it matters.
I want you to like him.

29:59.048 --> 30:01.091
Why did you turn down the SOE job?

30:02.051 --> 30:03.719
It's just...

30:03.803 --> 30:05.971
Wasn't the plan that
we had for our lives.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.640
How do you know it was SOE?

30:09.016 --> 30:10.267
'Cause I recommended you.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.187
Michael...

30:14.480 --> 30:16.482
You should've told me.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.693
Look, Peggy, I know you
better than anyone else alive.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.028
And...

30:21.779 --> 30:23.531
This isn't what you want.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.825
What is it that you think I want?

30:26.534 --> 30:29.787
The same thing you've wanted
since you were a little girl.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.163
A life of adventure.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.499
Well, I've grown up.

30:33.582 --> 30:34.667
My dreams changed.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.544
No, you've just let everyone else
drum them out of you.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.964
Fred's a nice enough chap,
but be honest,

30:40.047 --> 30:41.131
is he the love of your life?

30:41.590 --> 30:43.425
Is this really how you see your future?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.636
This is my engagement party, Michael.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.221
Not your wedding day.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.100
Look, there is still time
to change your mind.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.143
I don't have to listen to this.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.647
Don't worry what other people think.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.983
You are meant to fight.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.403
Stop pretending to be someone
that you're not.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.697
Peg...

31:04.780 --> 31:06.323
Peggy, come back.

31:06.991 --> 31:10.578
Peggy, Peggy. Wait.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.122
I didn't account
for the Central District judge

31:13.205 --> 31:15.374
being in the Council's pocket. I'm sorry.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.543
Don't apologise for believing
people have ethics and morals.

31:21.422 --> 31:24.300
The Arena Club's removed
any incriminating evidence by now.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.219
Our only chance at infiltrating that place
is locked in a broom closet.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.096
I doubt we can poison him again.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.681
What's the next step?

31:30.764 --> 31:33.559
Your next step is to stay here
and save your hide.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.020
Why? 'Cause a tidal wave is coming,

31:36.103 --> 31:37.855
and all my friends
are gonna be branded commies?

31:38.230 --> 31:40.024
Yeah, I got that speech, too.

31:41.025 --> 31:43.068
I'm in this with you till the end, Peggy.

31:43.986 --> 31:46.238
It's only gonna get
more difficult, Daniel.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.740
They've taken all the evidence
from the SSR.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.451
Mmm. Not all of it.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.873
Tissue sample
from Jane Scott's autopsy.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.958
I convinced Dr Samberly to misplace it.

31:58.042 --> 31:59.710
Told him I'd put in a good word
for him with Rose.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.420
You are brilliant.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.505
Let's pay another visit
to our guest in the broom closet.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.029
On your feet.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.114
Move!

32:30.240 --> 32:31.659
We can talk this out, huh?

32:32.117 --> 32:33.577
Like a couple of soldiers.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.163
Talking is done. Council's on to us.

32:36.246 --> 32:38.540
We can't risk you returning to the fold
and opening your trap

32:38.624 --> 32:40.250
about what we know.

32:40.334 --> 32:42.586
Look, if you're gonna shoot me,

32:42.670 --> 32:44.088
you might as well go ahead
and do it right here,

32:44.171 --> 32:46.298
'cause I'm done marching.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.259
Have it your way.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.353
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.897
I still don't know
why I had to take a punch.

33:01.981 --> 33:04.692
It's the least you could contribute.
He's already throttled me twice.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.661
I need a drink.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.712
<i>What happened, Mr Hunt?</i>

33:24.795 --> 33:26.755
<i>I ain't talking to you.
Where's Chadwick?</i>

33:27.339 --> 33:28.716
<i>Cal's at a fundraising dinner.</i>

33:28.799 --> 33:31.135
- He could be begging all night.
- Good.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.053
He won't mind if I help myself.

33:34.263 --> 33:35.806
What happened?

33:37.099 --> 33:39.268
I ain't saying a word
till your husband gets home.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.186
<i>I said I need a drink.</i>

33:41.270 --> 33:42.354
This could take a while.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.732
A drink sounds pretty good
right about now.

33:49.403 --> 33:50.738
I'll bring the bottle.

33:59.163 --> 34:02.541
Mum, we can't have you weeping
all through the ceremony.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.835
Can I help crying when I'm happy?

34:05.961 --> 34:09.214
- Where is my blasted handkerchief?
- Oh.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.349
Oh, dear.

34:20.142 --> 34:22.561
Let's get this dress off
before I stain it.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.445
Oh, I'll go and see who that is.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.248
Stewart, what is it?

35:01.225 --> 35:03.185
Michael!

35:51.191 --> 35:52.484
<i>You call this the good stuff?</i>

35:52.568 --> 35:54.570
<i>I'm sorry
if our liquor cabinet fails</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:56.321
<i>to live up to your standards, Mr Hunt.</i>

35:56.530 --> 35:58.031
Jason, is everything all right?

35:58.740 --> 36:00.826
<i>Goes down like...</i>

36:00.909 --> 36:03.287
- Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
- It's okay.

36:03.745 --> 36:07.082
I'm just... Having trouble concentrating.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.834
What is it? Are you unwell?

36:09.918 --> 36:11.879
Have you ever been so bone-tired...

36:12.921 --> 36:15.007
That no matter what you did...

36:15.090 --> 36:17.259
You simply cannot
keep your eyes open?

36:17.718 --> 36:20.137
Jason, I know you say you can't sleep,
but please try.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.263
It's more than that.

36:21.722 --> 36:23.348
I can't describe it.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.768
It's as if...

36:26.852 --> 36:29.188
Something is calling me...

36:30.272 --> 36:31.315
Pulling me away.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.900
Pulling you away? To where?

36:32.983 --> 36:34.026
I don't know.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.737
But it would be really easy to just...

36:38.447 --> 36:39.823
Let go.

36:44.161 --> 36:47.873
My brother used to say to me
that I was meant to fight.

36:48.624 --> 36:51.460
I believe you're cut
from the same cloth, Jason.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.921
We will fix this, I promise you.

36:54.463 --> 36:55.839
But you can't let go.

36:56.632 --> 36:58.550
You must hold on.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.270
<i>Calvin, is that you?</i>

37:10.938 --> 37:12.272
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

37:12.356 --> 37:14.608
<i>Oh, Rufus, you've been
missing in action all day.</i>

37:14.691 --> 37:15.734
Chadwick's arrived home.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.027
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>

37:17.110 --> 37:19.196
You look like you've gone 10 rounds
with a meat grinder.

37:19.279 --> 37:23.450
Yeah, that SSR agent, the one
you had me go after, Peggy Carter?

37:23.533 --> 37:24.576
She kidnapped me.

37:25.327 --> 37:26.370
Kidnapped?

37:26.453 --> 37:28.622
Yeah, she shot me
with a tranquilliser gun,

37:28.705 --> 37:30.082
<i>locked me in her trunk.</i>

37:30.165 --> 37:31.375
<i>She tried to kill me.</i>

37:31.458 --> 37:33.502
<i>She's finished.
I'll have her job for this.</i>

37:33.585 --> 37:35.087
<i>I will have her deported.</i>

37:35.170 --> 37:36.713
Who the hell does she think she is
that she can...

37:36.797 --> 37:38.131
What did you tell her?

37:40.509 --> 37:44.346
- What? I didn't...
- What did you tell her?

37:48.475 --> 37:51.270
All right, look. She...
She injected me with something.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.981
I thought I was dying, all right?

37:57.109 --> 37:58.360
What did you say?

38:03.115 --> 38:04.741
She wanted names.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.035
And you gave them to her?

38:07.119 --> 38:10.205
We hired you because you said
you couldn't be broken.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.916
And this is what you have to show for it?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.460
No. I'm not taking the fall for this.

38:15.544 --> 38:17.546
You're gonna have to answer
to the Council yourself.

38:17.629 --> 38:18.880
See, I think that's where you're wrong.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.927
No. You're gonna protect me.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.762
'Cause I can go to the Council, too,

38:26.054 --> 38:29.433
and tell them what you're up to
and what your wife's up to.

38:29.808 --> 38:34.396
So you're gonna help me,
or I'm gonna get real yappy, real fast.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.857
- You son of a bitch.
- Sweetheart...

38:36.940 --> 38:38.358
I have to show you something.

38:38.442 --> 38:40.360
Whitney,
I'm in the middle of something here.

38:40.444 --> 38:43.655
- You know, just get out of here.
- I know, but this is important.

38:43.739 --> 38:46.366
<i>Mr Hunt made a mistake.</i>

38:48.827 --> 38:51.121
And we all make mistakes.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.543
And mistakes can be fixed.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.723
Whitney... What are you doing?

39:10.599 --> 39:12.851
Whitney, what is this?

39:15.103 --> 39:17.314
<i>Whitney! Whitney, stop!</i>

39:17.397 --> 39:18.690
<i>Stop!</i>

39:20.734 --> 39:22.235
We lost the signal.

39:22.319 --> 39:23.653
What on Earth did she do?

39:23.945 --> 39:25.322
I don't know.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.725
Paper! Get your paper!

39:59.731 --> 40:01.400
Didn't I see you here last week?

40:02.984 --> 40:04.778
We didn't change the movie.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.947
What's the point in seeing it again?

40:07.697 --> 40:09.449
It's a nice escape from the world.

40:09.866 --> 40:12.035
Helps you forget about your troubles.

40:14.663 --> 40:15.872
Hey.

40:22.129 --> 40:23.839
Just this once.

40:31.513 --> 40:34.724
You know, I bet you're real pretty
when you smile.

40:37.894 --> 40:40.647
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

40:42.315 --> 40:45.360
Ned Silver, talent agent to the stars.

40:46.194 --> 40:47.279
A smile like that,

40:47.362 --> 40:49.990
I bet I could get you some work
as a model.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.119
Or maybe...

40:54.870 --> 40:57.038
Even an actress
in one of those pictures.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.585
What do you think?

41:08.633 --> 41:11.178
- That sounds real interesting.
- Fantastic.

41:12.471 --> 41:13.555
What's your name?

41:13.638 --> 41:16.475
Agnes. Agnes Cully.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.728
Well, that'll have to change.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.855
Why?

41:21.938 --> 41:24.649
'Cause you need a name
as pretty as you are.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.904
That's the beauty of Hollywood.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.406
You can be whatever you want.

41:49.883 --> 41:51.593
What happened, Whitney?

41:51.676 --> 41:53.053
What happened?

41:53.845 --> 41:55.305
What was that?

41:56.181 --> 41:57.682
That was me...

41:58.433 --> 42:01.853
Fixing another one of your problems.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.113
What are you?

42:15.659 --> 42:17.619
Whatever I want.
