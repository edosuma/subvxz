WEBVTT

00:19.833 --> 00:21.000
I'll be back.

00:21.066 --> 00:22.200
I'm free!

00:25.633 --> 00:26.633
No!

01:07.266 --> 01:08.933
'That's ten-odd hits
in a row.'

01:09.000 --> 01:10.433
'Whoo! Huh-oh!'

01:10.500 --> 01:12.100
'It's almost midnight'

01:12.166 --> 01:15.033
'and for those of you
working the graveyard shift'

01:15.100 --> 01:17.200
'the old hawker here
is gonna sign off the air'

01:17.266 --> 01:19.100
'with a little something
different tonight.'

01:19.166 --> 01:21.666
'The big Springwood versus
Pleasant Valley game'

01:21.733 --> 01:23.300
'is comin' up, as we all know.'

01:23.366 --> 01:26.766
'So here's the Springwood High
fight song. Night!'

02:12.266 --> 02:14.500
Oh, God!

02:14.566 --> 02:16.900
Oh, Beefy Boy God.

02:16.966 --> 02:18.933
Hear our prayer.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.333
Won't you accept..

02:21.400 --> 02:23.066
...this sacrifice?

02:23.133 --> 02:26.633
'And grant us fewer hours
this weekend?'

02:26.700 --> 02:29.933
I will sample your sacrifice.

02:36.766 --> 02:39.266
They're disgusting!

02:39.333 --> 02:40.666
Oh!

02:40.733 --> 02:42.000
God of grease.

02:42.066 --> 02:43.200
Bored, Ross?

02:43.266 --> 02:44.700
'Late shift gettin' to you?'

02:48.800 --> 02:50.900
You'd be talking
to, uh, styrofoam too

02:50.966 --> 02:52.566
you've been working here
long enough.

02:52.633 --> 02:54.533
Well, hop in, a little
cruise might clear your head!

02:54.600 --> 02:56.066
Come on!

02:56.133 --> 02:58.766
No chance, man,
this place is my ball and chain.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.000
Come on,
your dad'll let you off.

03:01.066 --> 03:03.066
Yeah, right.

03:03.133 --> 03:05.100
Okay, dude, it's your life

03:07.166 --> 03:08.533
- 'Bye.'
- 'Later.'

03:09.833 --> 03:11.133
My life?

03:13.633 --> 03:15.600
Yeah. Probably die here.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.433
Now, it's the graveyard shift.

03:34.466 --> 03:36.166
When I get hungry.

04:14.233 --> 04:15.333
Ooh!

04:16.433 --> 04:19.333
Guess what we want, Beefy Boy?

04:19.933 --> 04:21.266
Yes.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.900
'How would you like
to come with us'

04:22.966 --> 04:26.833
for a nice, long...ride?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.000
You'd enjoy it.

04:29.066 --> 04:30.833
Come, play.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.266
'You're so handsome.'

04:33.333 --> 04:35.000
'Come on, Bryan.'

04:35.066 --> 04:37.400
'We know you're in there
all by yourself.'

04:37.466 --> 04:39.633
We'd have so much fun.

04:40.766 --> 04:42.700
'Come on, sweetie,
we're waiting.'

04:44.366 --> 04:45.500
'Let's go.'

04:46.900 --> 04:49.033
Alright, son, place is yours
till the morning.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.100
Ho-ho-hold it, dad.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.333
I have to work all night?
You said, 3 a.m. was it.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.700
I'm sorry, Bryan,
my sunrise guy called in sick.

04:56.766 --> 04:57.700
One night won't kill ya.

04:57.766 --> 04:59.766
Dad, it's been one night
for three weeks!

04:59.833 --> 05:01.933
I've gotta fill out
these college applications.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.966
I'm leavin' this town
in September.

05:04.033 --> 05:06.100
I just think
it's important if you soak up

05:06.166 --> 05:09.333
as much business sense
as possible before you..

05:09.400 --> 05:12.566
...waste your life with that,
uh, liberal arts.

05:12.633 --> 05:16.766
Dad, the only think I'm soaking
up around this place is grease.

05:16.833 --> 05:19.066
This place clothed you
and fed you.

05:19.133 --> 05:21.533
I can't believe you're planning
on turning your back on it now.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.800
I don't understand you, Bryan.

05:22.866 --> 05:24.866
Dad, it's not just&lt;i

05:24.933 --> 05:28.400
It's...Springwood,
it-it's a dead-end town.

05:28.466 --> 05:31.200
You know, I'm tired of seeing
bushes and trees, the lawns

05:31.266 --> 05:33.133
and...other green things.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.133
I want-I want concrete!

05:36.800 --> 05:39.533
Son...take a look around you.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.333
Don't you understand?

05:42.400 --> 05:44.166
After I'm gone..

05:44.233 --> 05:45.533
...all this'll be yours.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.333
All this'll be mine?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.533
I don't know
if I can wait that long

05:49.600 --> 05:51.566
for such a reward, dad.

05:51.633 --> 05:54.266
Patience, son. Patience.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.533
Goodnight.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.266
Hello.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.733
Don't bother picking me up.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.400
Oh, Bryan, not again.

06:16.466 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, he's tagged me
for the night shift.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.300
I'm staying till morning.

06:19.366 --> 06:20.933
I'll still come down
and hang out.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.300
Well, um..

06:22.366 --> 06:24.833
Gets kind of creepy around here,
Karyn, maybe you shouldn't.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.766
You need the company.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.600
I'll see you about 3:00, okay?

06:28.666 --> 06:29.633
Bye.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.200
Yeah.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.900
Welcome to Beefy Boy.
May I take your order?

07:05.566 --> 07:09.066
Hello? Anybody home?
May I take your order, please?

07:11.433 --> 07:14.233
'We're coming, Bryan.'

07:16.400 --> 07:18.266
Al, is that you?

07:20.666 --> 07:23.700
Al, quit screwin' around.

07:23.766 --> 07:26.633
'You can't run.
You can't hide.'

07:26.700 --> 07:28.633
'You're ours, Beefy Boy.'

08:11.366 --> 08:12.500
Hi.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.133
Cabin fever.

08:31.566 --> 08:33.533
Give me everything you've got.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.733
With everything on it.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.300
Bryan.

09:12.366 --> 09:13.933
Hey!

09:14.000 --> 09:15.566
Are you okay?

09:15.633 --> 09:17.600
Calm down.

09:17.666 --> 09:19.166
What, did you have a bad dream
or something?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.400
Yeah, the worst.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.066
Come on, I don't care
what my father says.

09:30.133 --> 09:32.600
We're gettin' out of here.
We're lockin' up.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.033
Are you sure, you're okay?

10:05.100 --> 10:06.066
Yeah.

10:06.133 --> 10:08.133
Um, it's just this headache.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.633
Oh!

10:09.700 --> 10:10.800
Come here.

10:14.733 --> 10:17.100
Thanks for
driving me home, Karyn.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.200
Sorry, I'm not
very good company.

10:19.266 --> 10:21.333
It's just this dream
was so real.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.400
I couldfeelthe bulle

10:25.466 --> 10:27.733
Why don't you try
to get some sleep?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.000
That's a laugh.

10:29.066 --> 10:30.200
As soon as the old man finds out

10:30.266 --> 10:32.333
I've left
the shop...I'm history.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.600
But you're seeing
the damn place in your dreams.

10:34.666 --> 10:37.433
He couldn't care less.
It's his fault I was there.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.500
I mean, he is the reason
I was there.

10:39.566 --> 10:41.533
Mom will just back him up.

10:43.533 --> 10:45.500
It'll be okay.

10:54.433 --> 10:56.400
I'll always love you, Bryan.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.633
Even if you do dream about girls
in pink Cadillacs.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.500
Springwood needs you, Bryan.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.466
Springwood needs you, Bryan.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.800
Springwood needs you, Bryan.

12:51.366 --> 12:52.766
'...has left thousands homeless'

12:52.833 --> 12:54.600
'and what has been called
the worst disaster'

12:54.666 --> 12:57.533
'to strike the region
in more than 50 years.'

12:57.600 --> 12:58.866
'And locally..'

12:58.933 --> 13:01.133
'...yet another
mysterious drive-by shooting'

13:01.200 --> 13:02.833
'occurred early this morning.'

13:02.900 --> 13:04.633
'Springwood police
remain baffled at..'

13:21.800 --> 13:23.733
'Give me everything you've got.'

13:38.400 --> 13:39.400
'Mom!'

13:40.266 --> 13:41.233
Mom!

13:42.633 --> 13:43.933
Mom!

13:49.333 --> 13:51.300
Mom, I don't feel too good.

13:51.366 --> 13:54.666
I'm not surprised,
leaving the family business.

13:54.733 --> 13:58.600
Don't worry,
it's only our livelihood.

13:58.666 --> 14:00.066
Mom, I couldn't take it anymore.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.133
That place was eating me up.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.866
Mom, please.

14:05.933 --> 14:09.566
For once, why can't you be
the kinda mom who..

14:16.633 --> 14:19.266
Oh, sweetie,
did you wipe your feet?

14:19.333 --> 14:21.300
I just waxed the floor.

14:30.566 --> 14:32.133
Mom, do I look okay?

14:32.200 --> 14:34.366
Did you finish your chores?

14:34.433 --> 14:36.100
Chores?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.233
Yes, the lawn needs to be mowed.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.400
We don't have a lawn.

14:41.466 --> 14:43.400
The dog needs to be walked.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.066
We don't have a dog.

14:46.133 --> 14:49.900
How do some nice cookies
and milk sound?

14:49.966 --> 14:51.833
Cookies and milk?

14:51.900 --> 14:55.966
Don't forget, Wally and Chip
and Ernie will be over soon.

14:56.033 --> 14:59.333
Now, you boys have fun
on that pay for drive.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.466
Now, there are three boys who
never disappoint their parents.

15:12.766 --> 15:16.333
Let your mother
feel your head.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.333
Come here.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.633
Getting too old
to kiss your mother?

15:56.066 --> 15:58.466
Hey, Bryan, you don't mind
about me and Karyn

15:58.533 --> 16:01.000
seein' as how
you're gonna be here forever.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.400
Besides, I never really liked
the meat in this place anyway.

16:10.266 --> 16:11.300
Hey!

16:12.933 --> 16:16.200
Wait a minute.
Karyn! Karyn!

16:49.233 --> 16:50.566
What was that noise?

16:50.633 --> 16:52.100
It's the mailman, dear.

16:52.166 --> 16:55.400
Look, letters of acceptanc
from colleges.

16:55.466 --> 16:57.166
Well, I guess that seals it.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.500
You're really leaving
aren't you?

16:58.566 --> 17:00.633
That's what I've been trying
to tell you for two years, dad.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.533
What's so bad about a man
building a business

17:03.600 --> 17:05.366
making it work,
and wanting to pass it on

17:05.433 --> 17:06.466
to his own flesh and blood.

17:06.533 --> 17:07.500
Nothing, dear.

17:07.566 --> 17:08.833
Well, according to him there is.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.333
Could I please have those?

17:11.400 --> 17:14.166
Those belong to me. Those are
my tickets out of here.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.800
Come on, Bryan, you need college
like a hole in the head.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.933
Come on, sit down, eat.

17:20.566 --> 17:22.433
Dad?

17:22.500 --> 17:26.933
Dad, after what happened
last night I'm never going back!

17:33.233 --> 17:36.833
Don't count your burgers
before they're on the bun, son.

17:42.966 --> 17:44.933
Hey, what are you doin'?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.533
That's my future!

17:50.266 --> 17:51.433
Here's your future.

17:54.533 --> 17:58.700
Don't you get it, Bryan?
You are Beefy Boy.

17:58.766 --> 18:01.466
It's time for
the "Beefy Boy Jingle."

18:31.833 --> 18:33.033
'Come on.'

18:40.666 --> 18:42.700
Pick up. Please.

18:55.766 --> 18:57.733
'Hello, Bryan.'

18:58.700 --> 18:59.700
How did you know it was me?

18:59.766 --> 19:01.800
'Who else would it be?'

19:03.233 --> 19:05.066
They're out to get me, Karyn.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.866
My folks,
they want me to go back.

19:07.933 --> 19:09.700
'Bryan, we have to talk.'

19:09.766 --> 19:11.066
'Something horrible
has happened.'

19:11.133 --> 19:14.933
Karyn, I'm not going back.
I can't. I hate that place.

19:18.466 --> 19:20.433
Shut up!

19:32.733 --> 19:34.166
Happy, son?

19:34.233 --> 19:35.933
No point in going on.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.666
The business was our life,
but you destroyed it.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.366
Damn, lighter.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.333
No, I have a life too.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.833
I have a life outta this town.
I have a life outta here.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.833
It's alright, Bryan, we're old.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.100
So we die.

19:58.166 --> 20:02.533
You, you've got a life,
now that you've ruined ours.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.500
- Go, live yours.
- Shut up!

20:05.566 --> 20:07.300
Shut up. Shut it up.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.200
Give us a goodbye hug.

20:11.266 --> 20:13.333
Give us everything you've got

20:13.400 --> 20:15.333
with everything on it.

20:23.266 --> 20:25.233
Someone's ordering son,
wanna get it?

20:26.333 --> 20:28.300
Dad, stop it.

20:30.466 --> 20:35.833
Let us go. You win.
We're used up. Let us to rot.

20:37.766 --> 20:39.733
Please, stop it.

20:41.166 --> 20:45.033
'Leave me alone.
My son has forsaken me.'

20:48.066 --> 20:52.033
Stop, dad. Stop. Stop it.

21:02.666 --> 21:05.700
Shh! It'll be alright.

21:09.133 --> 21:11.266
So glad to see you.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.800
You know, I only want
what's best for you.

21:13.866 --> 21:16.966
They keep sending me back.

21:17.033 --> 21:20.933
I try and I try...
but I keep going back.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.366
I know.

21:23.433 --> 21:26.633
But this time,
you have to go back.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.800
- For real.
- What are you saying?

21:29.866 --> 21:31.800
Bryan, don't be difficult.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.766
This isn't where you belong.

21:34.833 --> 21:37.466
Not you too.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.866
Please, not you.

21:39.933 --> 21:41.900
Sometimes we have no choice.

21:47.433 --> 21:50.066
Sometimes we're dealt
of stacked deck.

21:50.133 --> 21:52.333
I thought you were on my side.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.300
I've always been on your side.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.066
Don't you see?

21:59.133 --> 22:01.133
I am you.

22:37.133 --> 22:39.733
'Welcome to Beefy Boy,
may I take your order, please.'

22:41.466 --> 22:44.000
'Hello, a-anybody there?
Can I take your order?'

23:11.333 --> 23:13.300
Give me everything
you got, Bryan.

23:16.766 --> 23:18.733
With everything on it.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.533
I'll die here.

23:49.766 --> 23:51.066
They're being taken to Mercy.

23:51.133 --> 23:53.466
She has superficial wounds.
He's gone.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.066
Damn, graveyard shift.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.100
Poor kids never knew
what hit 'em.

24:30.966 --> 24:32.933
Have it my way.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.933
- Gunshot.
- You have the specifics?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.400
Drive-by shooter, thrill kill.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.633
Her boyfriend was hit bad.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.633
They clipped her,
but it looks fixable.

25:16.566 --> 25:19.666
Dr. Sterling to ER stat.

25:19.733 --> 25:22.433
Repeat, Dr. Serling to ER stat.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.800
'Got it.'

25:46.700 --> 25:48.133
Ready?

25:49.500 --> 25:51.166
'Lift. Up!'

25:51.233 --> 25:52.466
No, I don't wanna be here.

25:52.533 --> 25:54.500
Relax, honey, you'll be fine.

25:58.166 --> 25:59.933
Alright, who's working
on the backup generator?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.966
'Alright, let's go.'

26:07.700 --> 26:10.933
An apple a day,
ain't gonna keep me away.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.100
Yeah, see,
here and here, fragments.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.466
Damn large caliber.

26:32.533 --> 26:34.633
It looks minor but it may
have broken her up inside.

26:39.366 --> 26:42.500
Please. I hate it here.
Please let me go.

26:43.766 --> 26:44.900
It'll be fine.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.500
Uh, just be calm, Karyn.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.400
'Your wound's not that serious
and we'll have you out'

26:50.466 --> 26:51.700
'of here in no time.'

26:51.766 --> 26:54.033
Right after we amputate
both legs and your left arm.

26:54.666 --> 26:55.633
What?

26:56.566 --> 26:57.633
What, dear?

26:57.700 --> 26:59.900
You're gonna cut off my legs
and my arm?

26:59.966 --> 27:02.033
Nobody's going to cut
anything off.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.633
Now, just lay still, Karyn..

27:04.700 --> 27:06.333
...and let yourself drift off.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.100
'Believe me.
You're in good hands.'

27:38.466 --> 27:42.533
See...the bullet bounced around.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.000
The damage is a little mor
extensive than I thought.

27:46.133 --> 27:48.266
She's got to help us.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.600
Artery, Miss Keegan.

27:50.666 --> 27:51.833
Come on, Karyn, fight.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.833
'Damn things in tatters.'

27:56.500 --> 27:59.533
This is gotta be
an extremely delicate incision.

27:59.966 --> 28:01.033
Scalpel.

28:15.233 --> 28:16.233
Sorry.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.600
Well, better than
the piano lessons.

28:25.466 --> 28:27.133
'She's coming out of it.'

28:27.200 --> 28:28.500
Put her back under.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.133
Alright.

28:52.266 --> 28:53.733
Here we go.

29:04.666 --> 29:06.500
'Oh!'

29:06.566 --> 29:08.500
- Oh, she's coming out of it.
- 'No!'

29:08.566 --> 29:10.300
Will you please keep her under,
Frankie?

29:16.400 --> 29:17.533
You'll be fine.

29:24.966 --> 29:28.200
Now...where are those
motor skills?

29:29.333 --> 29:31.333
Ah! Here we are.

29:35.433 --> 29:37.400
I'm going to need
some assistance over here.

29:42.066 --> 29:43.033
'No!'

29:47.000 --> 29:48.033
'Oh!'

29:50.233 --> 29:51.233
'No!'

30:08.033 --> 30:09.900
Hello. How are you today?

30:10.366 --> 30:11.433
Stop.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.533
Aren't you the one
with the hearing impairment?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.033
No!

30:15.500 --> 30:16.833
Hmm!

30:16.900 --> 30:20.266
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're the gunshot wound.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.600
My mistake.

30:21.666 --> 30:24.100
It has been so crazy
in here ever since the storm.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.066
I wanna go home.

30:26.133 --> 30:27.800
No, no, no,
you gotta get some rest.

30:27.866 --> 30:29.700
Doctor's orders.

30:29.766 --> 30:31.900
Bryan. Where's Bryan?

30:33.233 --> 30:34.666
- What?
- My boyfriend.

30:34.733 --> 30:36.300
- He was brought in with me.
- I'm sorry.

30:36.366 --> 30:38.566
You're gonna have to talk
to Dr. Serling about that.

30:38.633 --> 30:39.966
He'll be in
in just a minute.

30:40.033 --> 30:41.033
No.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.800
Well, how's my
favorite patient today?

31:29.866 --> 31:31.666
Where's Bryan?

31:31.733 --> 31:34.000
Right to the chase, huh?

31:34.066 --> 31:36.100
Well, he's in room 20
on the first floor.

31:36.966 --> 31:38.466
But we'll worry about him later.

31:38.533 --> 31:41.600
Right now,
I'm concerned about you.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.533
I don't wanna stay here.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.700
You can't make me stay here.

31:45.766 --> 31:48.533
Come on,
you're not giving us a chance.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.000
Everybody hates hospitals.

31:51.066 --> 31:53.633
You must give us the benefit
of the doubt, believe me.

31:53.700 --> 31:54.733
You'll be fine.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.233
You keep saying that.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.800
The operation.

32:00.433 --> 32:02.566
I can't believe what I saw.

32:02.633 --> 32:04.333
Now, now,
it's not unusual to drift

32:04.400 --> 32:06.300
in and out under sedation.

32:06.366 --> 32:08.533
Important thing
is you're over the hump

32:08.600 --> 32:10.100
and your parents
will be here soon.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.833
My parents?

32:11.900 --> 32:13.266
No, they can't be coming.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.333
Karyn, please.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.700
You must be still.

32:16.766 --> 32:17.733
Nurse?

32:22.333 --> 32:25.233
Now, trust me. It'll be fine.

33:33.933 --> 33:36.100
Well, welcome back.

33:50.933 --> 33:52.400
That's a good girl.

33:56.100 --> 34:00.100
You're sweating like a..
You're perspiring quite a bit.

34:00.166 --> 34:01.566
Lemme fix the air conditioner.

34:01.633 --> 34:02.900
'I want out of here.'

34:02.966 --> 34:04.333
I want Bryan.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.233
Everything's being
taken care of.

34:13.433 --> 34:14.700
I wanna go home.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.533
Please get someone to help me.

34:18.233 --> 34:19.800
I'm here to help you.

34:19.866 --> 34:22.000
What's the matter,
aren't I good enough for you?

34:22.066 --> 34:23.366
No, it's not that, it's--

34:23.433 --> 34:24.766
No, no, I get it.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.633
I'm only the nurse, right?

34:26.700 --> 34:30.200
I'm not the&lt;T
I'm only the nurse!

34:30.266 --> 34:32.433
No golf on Wednesdays
for me, no!

34:32.500 --> 34:35.700
I get bedpans and rectal
thermometers for life!

35:26.600 --> 35:28.533
You'll be fine.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.333
You're making me crazy.

35:48.233 --> 35:49.300
'Karyn?'

36:38.966 --> 36:39.933
'Karyn?'

36:42.700 --> 36:43.700
Bryan?

36:54.966 --> 36:56.733
Shh!

36:57.366 --> 36:58.633
Come on.

37:00.733 --> 37:03.100
We'll be like
Romeo and Juliet.

37:03.166 --> 37:06.600
- But they died.
- Yeah.

37:34.066 --> 37:37.100
You can have a look. See..
It's like this.

37:40.233 --> 37:41.333
- Oh.
- See.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.633
That's how you do it.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.733
Yeah, yeah.
Take it in your hand.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.266
- Oh.
- Come on.

37:48.333 --> 37:51.266
I'm so.. I don't know
that I shouldn't..

37:51.333 --> 37:53.300
- 'I told you not to be afraid.'
- 'Okay.'

37:55.733 --> 37:57.700
Don't be afraid. It's the only
way you're gonna learn.

37:58.933 --> 38:00.666
- There you go.
- Ooh!

38:00.733 --> 38:02.433
- This is fun.
- Beautiful.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.966
- Tie.
- Is that good? Is that good?

38:06.033 --> 38:07.433
Yes.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.433
- 'Over and under.'
- 'Mm-hmm.'

38:11.500 --> 38:13.300
- And then I pull.
- Keep it tight, keep it tight.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.833
- Oh.
- Damn, look what I did.

38:18.666 --> 38:20.600
Up. I've seen worse.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.800
Do it this way.
We'll go underneath.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.133
There we go.

38:33.866 --> 38:35.833
Yes, practice makes perfect.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.633
What if she has
to tell us something?

38:40.700 --> 38:44.133
Oh...you'll be fine.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.700
Yeah. You'll be okay.

39:23.633 --> 39:25.200
Uh! Now, now.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.800
We mustn't bother
poor Mr. Shrek.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.000
- What's wrong with him?
- You don't wanna know.

39:30.066 --> 39:32.166
And besides you've got
other things to think about.

39:32.233 --> 39:33.600
Your parents are gonna
be here soon.

39:33.666 --> 39:34.933
Can't you get it
through your heads

39:35.000 --> 39:37.500
my parents are not coming.

39:37.566 --> 39:40.133
Don't you understand anything?

39:40.200 --> 39:42.100
No, no more drugs.

39:42.166 --> 39:44.833
Don't worry,
I've never missed yet.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.733
Wow! Made the fame.
Way to go.

41:10.866 --> 41:12.700
I'm not Shrek..

41:28.000 --> 41:29.233
Bryan?

41:45.433 --> 41:47.033
Bryan?

41:57.633 --> 41:59.833
No!

42:12.533 --> 42:15.833
No! No! No!

42:15.900 --> 42:18.800
No! No! No!

42:31.066 --> 42:32.200
Ah!

42:33.833 --> 42:36.166
Practice makes perfect.

42:36.233 --> 42:38.233
Come on in.

42:38.300 --> 42:39.700
We're accepting body parts.

42:39.766 --> 42:41.333
Would you like
to make a donation?

42:41.400 --> 42:43.466
- No!
- You'll be fine.

42:43.533 --> 42:45.100
No!

42:49.800 --> 42:52.100
Ah, we will take
whatever you've got.

43:48.133 --> 43:50.833
So how you feeling?

43:50.900 --> 43:53.600
Shh! Shh! Shh!
You-you'll be fine.

43:53.666 --> 43:55.333
You just lay still.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.033
It was more complicated
than we thought.

43:58.100 --> 44:00.033
But you are a fighter.

44:00.100 --> 44:02.100
'You pulled yourself through.'

44:05.600 --> 44:06.600
Bryan?

44:09.333 --> 44:11.000
Well, I'm afraid
your friend Bryan

44:11.066 --> 44:12.566
was pronounced
dead on arrival.

44:12.633 --> 44:14.900
- 'No.'
- I'm very sorry.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.300
This kind of place always
scares me since my parents--

44:23.366 --> 44:25.833
Hey, you save your strength.

44:25.900 --> 44:29.000
And I believe your parents
have finally arrived.

44:29.933 --> 44:31.733
What're you talking about?

44:31.800 --> 44:34.433
My parents died here.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.533
We were in an accident
and you couldn't save them.

44:38.633 --> 44:40.600
My parents died here.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.433
No!

44:46.500 --> 44:47.900
You both are dead.

44:49.200 --> 44:53.766
- 'No. No.'
- 'Shh. Shh. Shh.'

44:53.833 --> 44:55.100
'We're the only ones
here, Karyn.'

44:55.166 --> 44:56.300
'Relax, honey, it's okay.'

44:56.366 --> 44:58.333
'It's just the medication.'

45:02.566 --> 45:04.200
- She's till hallucinating.
- Shock.

45:04.266 --> 45:05.500
- No.
- 'It's all over now.'

45:05.566 --> 45:08.033
- 'Karyn, you're safe.'
- 'You'll be fine.'

45:20.966 --> 45:24.700
Remember...we make house calls.
