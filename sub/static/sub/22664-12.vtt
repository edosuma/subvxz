00:02.958 --> 00:04.334
Previously on Future Man...

00:04.459 --> 00:07.963
‐Do I know you? ‐I'm J‐‐Joosh.

00:08.087 --> 00:09.923
‐Where's Wolf? ‐He's gone.

00:11.424 --> 00:12.717
Fire in the hole!

00:14.135 --> 00:16.137
What the fuck did
you say to Kronish?

00:16.221 --> 00:17.889
I'm from the future!

00:17.973 --> 00:19.099
That's the Kronitorium,

00:19.140 --> 00:20.368
where the supercure
was engineered,

00:20.392 --> 00:21.268
where the Biotics were born.

00:21.393 --> 00:22.673
There's only one way to fix this

00:22.769 --> 00:25.647
and I'm doing it by myself.

00:25.730 --> 00:27.941
Let's get you home, soldier.

00:27.983 --> 00:30.068
Coming back for you,
thinking you were our savior?

00:30.110 --> 00:32.737
That was the biggest mistake
I've made in my life.

00:32.862 --> 00:34.114
Don't give up on me!

00:46.334 --> 00:48.837
Okay...

00:52.173 --> 00:53.341
Shit.

01:00.598 --> 01:02.475
Sir, can I help you?

01:02.517 --> 01:03.977
Holy shit!

01:04.019 --> 01:05.102
Carl!

01:08.023 --> 01:09.482
Do I know you?

01:09.524 --> 01:11.484
No, I'm‐‐I'm Josh Futterman,

01:11.526 --> 01:12.986
I‐‐I work here.

01:13.028 --> 01:15.405
Should be in the system,
I just forgot my ID.

01:21.870 --> 01:23.371
Okay!

01:25.749 --> 01:27.625
All right!

01:27.751 --> 01:30.712
Come back and we'll
have you arrested.

01:30.754 --> 01:33.256
Okay, go over there,
go over there, please go.

01:33.340 --> 01:36.760
Go away, go away, no, no, no!

01:36.885 --> 01:38.011
Stu!

01:39.512 --> 01:40.972
Did I take your bench?

01:41.014 --> 01:41.973
I'm sorry.

01:42.015 --> 01:44.267
No, Stu, it's me, what...

01:44.351 --> 01:46.603
what are you doing?

01:46.644 --> 01:49.022
The fuck is going on
with this timeline?

02:03.953 --> 02:05.455
What the...

02:15.715 --> 02:17.592
Hey hey, JFUTZ!

02:17.675 --> 02:18.968
You're home earls, bro.

02:19.094 --> 02:21.846
How was Macau,
you rock that shit?

02:21.930 --> 02:23.181
Trend alert!

02:23.223 --> 02:25.183
I'll have to say goodbye
to that leather and mesh?

02:25.225 --> 02:26.851
Hello, retro!

02:26.935 --> 02:28.061
You pull it off great.

02:28.103 --> 02:29.104
How was the tourney?

02:29.229 --> 02:30.105
The crowd looked sick,

02:30.230 --> 02:31.481
like, bigger than BlizzCon,

02:31.564 --> 02:33.608
like, sick, dude.

02:33.691 --> 02:37.362
Yeah, yeah, it was bigger
than BlizzCon for sure.

02:37.487 --> 02:39.572
It was crazy, there
were so many people.

02:39.614 --> 02:41.991
I'm suffering from
jet lag at the moment,

02:42.075 --> 02:43.159
I feel like.

02:43.201 --> 02:44.452
Jet lag‐‐dude, you fly private.

02:44.536 --> 02:47.414
Don't they, like,
engineer out the jet lag?

02:47.455 --> 02:48.706
‐Private? ‐Yeah.

02:48.790 --> 02:50.417
Yeah, I think they're‐‐

02:50.458 --> 02:52.460
it's a new technology
they're working on,

02:52.544 --> 02:55.713
figuring out‐‐hey,
where are my parents?

02:55.839 --> 02:57.316
At the dope‐ass
condo you put them in,

02:57.340 --> 02:58.591
where else would they be?

02:58.675 --> 02:59.926
World's Greatest Son alert!

03:01.719 --> 03:03.179
Can you excuse me just a minute?

03:07.308 --> 03:09.227
Where the fuck am I?

03:30.707 --> 03:32.459
My name is Joosh.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.299
Ladies and gentlemen, JFUTZ!

03:39.340 --> 03:41.843
Where the fuck am I?

03:41.926 --> 03:44.471
Whoa.

03:44.596 --> 03:46.473
Uncle Barry?

03:46.556 --> 03:49.184
He took my advice!

03:49.225 --> 03:51.686
And took my name.

03:51.728 --> 03:52.604
No way!

03:52.729 --> 03:55.482
Drink JOOSH, biatch!

03:55.607 --> 03:58.568
Hype your thirst,
punch your brain!

03:58.610 --> 04:01.112
I think that's a lot of money.

04:01.196 --> 04:03.615
Holy shit, I'm in Ibiza!

04:03.740 --> 04:05.617
Fuck yeah, Joosh.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.285
My...

04:07.327 --> 04:09.037
I have a Bentley.

04:11.831 --> 04:14.876
Engaging rainforest mode.

04:15.001 --> 04:17.587
Whoa.

04:19.464 --> 04:22.132
Rainforest mode?

04:22.217 --> 04:23.843
My life rules!

04:34.103 --> 04:36.022
Hey, don't worry about that.

04:36.147 --> 04:38.000
You don't have to do that,
I got somebody to clean

04:38.024 --> 04:38.983
that shit up for me, don't I?

04:39.025 --> 04:40.777
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

04:42.904 --> 04:45.281
Well, we alerted
the crew, as per ushe,

04:45.365 --> 04:47.158
but if you're, like,
super jet lagged,

04:47.283 --> 04:48.469
we could tell them to fuck off.

04:48.493 --> 04:49.619
What?

04:49.702 --> 04:51.702
No, don't tell them that,
I'd love to see the crew,

04:51.746 --> 04:52.497
it'd be great.

04:52.622 --> 04:54.123
‐Okay. ‐And your bae is getting

04:54.249 --> 04:56.376
back from Japan today.

04:56.501 --> 04:57.377
No way!

04:57.502 --> 04:58.753
Bae's coming back so soon?

04:58.878 --> 05:02.257
Just got an alert this morning
that Destiny is en route, bam!

05:02.340 --> 05:03.258
She's coming.

05:03.341 --> 05:04.217
That's amazing.

05:04.259 --> 05:05.218
I hope she's not
too tired, though.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.387
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.763
Mark my words.

05:08.846 --> 05:11.474
In six years,
Governor Amal Clooney.

05:11.516 --> 05:13.851
‐Politics! ‐No doubt.

05:18.898 --> 05:20.483
Where the hell
have you guys been?

05:20.525 --> 05:22.402
‐The '40s. ‐'90s.

05:25.738 --> 05:27.498
There's gotta be some
coke in here somewhere.

05:27.532 --> 05:30.493
So you're telling me
that all that happened,

05:30.577 --> 05:31.995
years of your lives,

05:32.120 --> 05:33.746
happened in the time
that it took me

05:33.830 --> 05:35.957
to get from the
Kronitorium to this house?

05:35.999 --> 05:36.874
Yeah.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.960
I've been here
for like 20 minutes.

05:39.002 --> 05:42.005
Time travel's a real mindfuck.

05:42.088 --> 05:44.716
Is that different wallpaper?

05:44.757 --> 05:46.467
You got any coke?

05:46.509 --> 05:47.969
‐No!
‐You think those space pirates

05:48.011 --> 05:49.470
downstairs have a hookup?

05:49.512 --> 05:51.598
First of all,
those are my friends,

05:51.639 --> 05:54.517
not space pirates,
and second of all,

05:54.601 --> 05:56.644
you need to clean up, Wolf.

05:56.728 --> 05:57.979
Okay, look.

05:58.021 --> 05:59.772
I appreciate the concern,

05:59.897 --> 06:02.734
but I think if I just
had a little cocaine,

06:02.775 --> 06:04.277
I'd be able to think straight.

06:04.402 --> 06:07.155
And then I'll quit, I swear.

06:07.238 --> 06:09.657
Crack is fine too, in a pinch.

06:09.741 --> 06:12.493
God, Wolf,
the '90s hit you hard.

06:12.619 --> 06:14.495
Okay, enough of
this jibber‐jabber.

06:14.579 --> 06:15.779
All right, we gotta skedaddle.

06:15.872 --> 06:17.248
If the Kronitorium exists,

06:17.373 --> 06:19.351
then we don't know how far
along Kronish is with the cure.

06:19.375 --> 06:20.710
It might already be out there.

06:20.752 --> 06:22.462
Okay, but we don't
even have a TTD.

06:22.503 --> 06:23.981
‐What are we doing to do?
‐Well, we gotta get the skinny

06:24.005 --> 06:25.482
on what we're up against
in that building.

06:25.506 --> 06:27.258
Well, I can't even
go into the building

06:27.383 --> 06:29.093
and I don't think
that you should either.

06:29.135 --> 06:32.764
Catch that berry,
catch that berry, whoa!

06:34.265 --> 06:35.266
How about this, okay?

06:35.391 --> 06:37.769
How about I stay here,
help Wolf get clean,

06:37.894 --> 06:41.105
- ‐and you can handle the recon.
- ‐

06:41.147 --> 06:42.023
I puked in your Jordans.

06:42.106 --> 06:43.375
Well, it's not
going to be pretty.

06:43.399 --> 06:46.778
I mean, this little angel
has got the devil up in him.

06:46.861 --> 06:48.279
I can handle Wolf.

06:48.404 --> 06:51.157
And I know just
where to send you.

07:03.378 --> 07:04.504
Lordy!

07:06.255 --> 07:08.758
Jeepers creepers!

07:08.883 --> 07:11.219
Those bags, so rascally,
I never trust them.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.346
Yeah, they break on me a lot.

07:13.388 --> 07:16.140
Come on, it just expired!

07:16.265 --> 07:17.892
Give me a fucking break.

07:22.021 --> 07:23.981
What, couldn't cut it
as a regular cop,

07:24.023 --> 07:26.025
you piece‐of‐shit nobody.

07:26.109 --> 07:27.461
We're going to have
to do something about

07:27.485 --> 07:29.529
this dinner mess, aren't we?

07:36.244 --> 07:37.745
Freeze!

07:41.582 --> 07:43.126
Impossible.

07:45.753 --> 07:51.092
Well, this newfangled microwave
is just a miracle worker.

07:51.134 --> 07:53.136
I don't how to thank you
for this, Ty‐Anne.

07:53.261 --> 07:55.263
I haven't had
a home‐cooked meal since...

07:55.346 --> 07:58.266
well, since I lived
at home with my mom,

07:58.391 --> 07:59.892
and that was six months ago.

07:59.976 --> 08:02.145
You hush now, Stu‐bear.

08:02.270 --> 08:04.272
And tell me about
this job of yours.

08:04.397 --> 08:07.525
Your boss sounds like
a real interesting fellow.

08:07.650 --> 08:09.402
‐Kronish? ‐‐.

08:09.527 --> 08:10.486
He's nuts.

08:10.528 --> 08:12.088
Come now, the only
thing he's nuts about

08:12.155 --> 08:15.783
is firetrucks and lollies.

08:15.908 --> 08:18.244
Yeah, well, the only
thing he cares about now

08:18.369 --> 08:20.830
is protecting his research.

08:20.872 --> 08:22.057
But we don't know
what he's doing,

08:22.081 --> 08:24.250
I mean, nobody's
seen him in years.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.085
Good heavens.

08:26.127 --> 08:27.253
‐Thanks. ‐‐.

08:27.378 --> 08:29.314
He's just holed up on the
top floor of our building.

08:29.338 --> 08:33.426
He lives up there, just
working day and night.

08:33.467 --> 08:36.429
He must be so lonely.

08:36.471 --> 08:41.851
Yeah, well, if you're
into lonely guys...

08:41.933 --> 08:43.561
‐

08:45.104 --> 08:48.483
Anyway, he's crazy secretive.

08:48.608 --> 08:51.110
No computers,
no internet connections.

08:51.235 --> 08:52.588
We don't even know
what we're working on.

08:52.612 --> 08:54.614
All we know is that
live possums go up

08:54.739 --> 08:58.367
and dead possums come down.

08:58.493 --> 09:00.828
So many possums.

09:00.953 --> 09:02.955
Well, geez.

09:03.039 --> 09:05.833
What do you think
he's working on?

09:05.958 --> 09:07.835
I don't know.

09:07.919 --> 09:09.462
But apparently,
we're going to find out

09:09.545 --> 09:10.838
in two days, because

09:10.922 --> 09:12.562
he called the media
and he's going to give

09:12.590 --> 09:15.718
some kind of big announcement.

09:15.843 --> 09:17.595
So it's not too late.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.555
Too late for what?

09:19.597 --> 09:24.227
Well, for my famous
Hoppin' John, that's what!

09:26.062 --> 09:26.979
Whoa!

09:27.063 --> 09:29.315
I'm snowboarding down K2!

09:29.357 --> 09:30.233
God!

09:30.358 --> 09:31.943
Now I'm shooting Yetis, what?

09:31.984 --> 09:33.486
This game's amazing.

09:33.569 --> 09:35.488
Of course it is,
you developed it, bro.

10:08.104 --> 10:08.980
Died pretty fast.

10:09.063 --> 10:11.440
Yeah, that's a tricky level.

10:11.482 --> 10:12.942
Thanks, man.

10:12.984 --> 10:15.194
God, Josh!

10:15.236 --> 10:17.071
Josh!

10:17.113 --> 10:18.322
Who's Josh?

10:18.364 --> 10:21.492
I'm shitting your bed again.

10:25.955 --> 10:27.331
‐God, Wolf! ‐Come here.

10:27.415 --> 10:31.085
Come here, please come here.

10:31.210 --> 10:33.838
Please come here,
come on, come on, buddy.

10:33.921 --> 10:36.591
I just need a bump
and 20 bendy straws.

10:38.467 --> 10:39.802
Wolf, no.

10:39.844 --> 10:41.554
Okay, there's no coke here.

10:41.596 --> 10:43.598
Turns out that JFUTZ's
body is a temple.

10:43.681 --> 10:45.975
He's really into clean
living and I respect him.

10:46.058 --> 10:47.476
All right, we got super fruits,

10:47.602 --> 10:48.811
we got nut powders,

10:48.853 --> 10:50.229
but no cocaine all right?

10:50.354 --> 10:51.480
Look, buddy.

10:51.564 --> 10:52.958
I mean, try some of
this super smoothie,

10:52.982 --> 10:54.108
it'll pick you right up.

10:54.233 --> 10:55.234
Jesus!

10:55.359 --> 10:57.862
Coke!

10:57.945 --> 11:00.865
Coke!

11:20.343 --> 11:24.972
Goodnight, you sweet,
sweet, sad little man.

11:44.700 --> 11:45.701
Dude.

11:45.826 --> 11:47.828
You should have
warned me about OJ.

11:47.954 --> 11:50.331
What happened to
the man in this spoon?

11:53.334 --> 11:54.418
Look.

11:54.460 --> 11:55.795
I wrote a book.

11:55.836 --> 11:58.214
Brought you a signed copy, bro.

11:58.297 --> 11:59.799
Your name is Brian?

11:59.840 --> 12:01.926
How did I not know that?

12:06.222 --> 12:07.974
Zog?

12:08.057 --> 12:09.475
Hi, buddy.

12:09.558 --> 12:11.227
You're alive!

12:11.310 --> 12:12.478
Nope.

12:12.603 --> 12:13.479
Stupid!

12:13.562 --> 12:16.107
How did you skateboard
up the stairs?

12:16.232 --> 12:17.817
I ollie.

12:22.738 --> 12:25.574
I remember that first pickle
as if it was yesterday.

12:25.616 --> 12:28.077
Nothing ever tasted
that good again

12:28.202 --> 12:30.579
and nothing ever will.

12:30.663 --> 12:32.456
Furla‐wurla!

12:34.041 --> 12:37.712
What goes up must come down.

12:37.795 --> 12:39.964
That's Sir Isaac Newton.

12:41.966 --> 12:44.927
I'm sorry for everyone I hurt.

12:50.474 --> 12:51.809
Hey, Wolf.

12:51.851 --> 12:53.811
It's me, Corey.

12:53.853 --> 12:55.730
This song's for you, man.

13:55.081 --> 13:56.791
I can taste again!

14:19.688 --> 14:21.816
That's so good.

14:27.446 --> 14:29.490
Shit, my God!

14:35.079 --> 14:35.955
Whoo!

14:36.080 --> 14:36.956
My God.

14:37.039 --> 14:38.582
I'm flying through the sky.

14:38.707 --> 14:39.792
I'm so high!

14:39.834 --> 14:41.794
Sh‐‐.

14:41.836 --> 14:42.962
Skrills.

14:43.045 --> 14:46.590
I was just about to stick
my landing in Snowpocalypse.

14:46.715 --> 14:47.967
Hey, it's you.

14:48.092 --> 14:50.219
You want to try,
it's really fun.

14:50.302 --> 14:52.471
We have another
apocalypse to deal with.

14:52.555 --> 14:54.324
Kronish is two days away
from releasing the cure.

14:54.348 --> 14:56.600
We need to kill Kronish,
destroy his research,

14:56.725 --> 14:58.602
and blow up the Kronitorium.

14:58.727 --> 14:59.979
This is our only chance.

15:00.104 --> 15:02.106
Wow, so we're going,
like, full‐on T2.

15:02.231 --> 15:03.983
Judgment Day.

15:04.108 --> 15:07.069
Arnold was a frequent
customer at Wolf Arts

15:07.111 --> 15:09.196
and a good friend.

15:09.238 --> 15:11.866
Man.

15:11.949 --> 15:13.951
We had some sexcapades.

15:14.034 --> 15:14.952
Okay.

15:15.035 --> 15:16.355
This mission,
I mean, it calls for

15:16.453 --> 15:18.414
a much bigger kill team, but

15:18.455 --> 15:20.166
this is all we have, so...

15:20.207 --> 15:21.959
we're going to have
to train you up.

15:22.084 --> 15:23.169
Okay.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.212
Um...

15:25.337 --> 15:26.797
athletic stance,

15:26.839 --> 15:29.216
start sparring with
one of you guys, or...

15:31.844 --> 15:34.597
Spar, no... I think we'll‐‐

15:34.722 --> 15:35.949
I think we'll have
you start with someone

15:35.973 --> 15:38.434
of your own skill level.

15:39.727 --> 15:41.854
What the hell is that?

15:41.979 --> 15:44.190
I do not know why you have this,

15:44.231 --> 15:47.109
but she was on your
doorstep, and, um,

15:47.234 --> 15:48.611
she'll do.

15:48.736 --> 15:49.737
So let's begin.

15:53.115 --> 15:57.953
Come on, you're being
defeated by a charge slave.

16:05.711 --> 16:08.047
‐I just grazed boob.
‐Suck it up.

16:08.088 --> 16:09.924
Okay, all right,
time out, time out!

16:09.965 --> 16:12.218
Again, again, again.

16:16.222 --> 16:18.557
Yield, yield, yield, yield!

16:18.599 --> 16:21.852
This... is so stupid.

16:21.977 --> 16:23.354
I can't learn to fight in a day.

16:23.479 --> 16:25.481
Show me nose‐to‐brain.

16:25.564 --> 16:27.691
Okay, okay.

16:33.113 --> 16:34.365
Okay, that's something.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.092
Yeah, that something's
going to come in real handy

16:36.116 --> 16:37.576
after I get shot
a hundred times.

16:37.618 --> 16:39.286
You can't get shot,
you're essential

16:39.328 --> 16:41.080
‐to this mission.
‐ln order to take down

16:41.163 --> 16:43.332
the building, we need to
simultaneously detonate bombs

16:43.457 --> 16:45.334
in three strategic locations.

16:45.417 --> 16:46.210
Okay.

16:46.335 --> 16:48.087
Well, where am I
during all of that?

16:48.212 --> 16:50.214
At one of the
strategic locations.

16:50.339 --> 16:52.299
We're the bombs.

16:52.341 --> 16:54.468
What do you mean,
we're the bombs?

16:54.551 --> 16:56.303
What, like suicide vests?

16:56.345 --> 16:58.430
Well, we could do belts
but vests hold more.

16:58.472 --> 17:00.015
Yeah, that's a true fact.

17:00.140 --> 17:00.975
No!

17:01.016 --> 17:03.227
No, that cannot be the plan.

17:03.269 --> 17:05.145
Fine, we'll do belts.

17:05.271 --> 17:06.230
‐Jesus Christ. ‐No.

17:06.271 --> 17:09.023
Look, I cannot be a part
of this, all right?

17:09.108 --> 17:11.859
Well, with only
two soldiers and you,

17:11.902 --> 17:13.654
‐it's our only option. ‐No!

17:13.737 --> 17:15.757
Whatever you guys need to do,
you have to find another plan

17:15.781 --> 17:17.907
to save the world.

17:18.032 --> 17:20.202
Joosh out.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.873
You can't quit on us now.

17:26.959 --> 17:29.378
Look, I am no savior.

17:29.461 --> 17:30.901
‐You're the reason we're here.
‐Yeah.

17:30.963 --> 17:32.232
And you said it was
the worst decision

17:32.256 --> 17:33.257
of your entire life.

17:33.382 --> 17:34.591
I said that years ago.

17:34.633 --> 17:38.387
‐You said that this morning.
‐Time travel is fucked up.

17:38.470 --> 17:40.848
Look, everything that
I have tried to do

17:40.889 --> 17:42.891
has just made stuff worse.

17:43.017 --> 17:45.978
Okay, can't you see,
I am not cut out for this.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.855
We can't make you do this.

17:47.896 --> 17:49.356
You have to want to do this.

17:49.398 --> 17:51.734
You have to need to do this.

17:51.775 --> 17:54.653
Without conviction,
there's no self‐detonation.

17:56.530 --> 17:57.531
Thank you

17:57.656 --> 17:59.241
for your service, Future Man.

18:03.495 --> 18:04.955
You're letting him go?

18:04.997 --> 18:07.458
He's already gone.

18:07.499 --> 18:09.752
I hope you stick whatever
landing you're looking for.

18:17.509 --> 18:18.761
Wow.

18:18.886 --> 18:22.473
She's really nice now.

18:22.514 --> 18:25.100
I know what you're thinking.

18:25.142 --> 18:26.518
Why race into a burning building

18:26.602 --> 18:30.230
when I already live
in a fireproof palace?

18:30.272 --> 18:32.775
No, I wasn't thinking that.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.987
Well, I used to hide
in a palace of my own,

18:37.029 --> 18:41.283
but as someone who's
been to hell and back,

18:41.408 --> 18:43.118
I'll tell you this.

18:43.202 --> 18:46.372
There is one downside
to cocaine addiction.

18:46.455 --> 18:48.749
It takes most of
the day to kick it,

18:48.832 --> 18:51.627
so you lose the day.

18:51.710 --> 18:52.878
Second...

18:55.339 --> 18:57.383
none of this is real.

18:57.508 --> 19:01.762
Your house, your
lifestyle, your friends.

19:01.845 --> 19:03.472
It's all an illusion.

19:08.769 --> 19:10.104
Wolf.

19:10.145 --> 19:12.898
Wolf!

19:12.981 --> 19:14.274
Look, somehow,

19:14.358 --> 19:18.237
fucking up this mission
made my life amazing.

19:18.278 --> 19:19.530
Okay, don't you get it?

19:19.613 --> 19:22.241
In this timeline, where I
never played The Biotic Wars,

19:22.282 --> 19:25.077
everything is better.

19:25.119 --> 19:28.455
This is the universe
telling me to stop.

19:28.497 --> 19:29.873
No.

19:29.998 --> 19:32.835
This is fear preventing you
from becoming a legend.

19:40.509 --> 19:41.760
So you just get the other stuff

19:41.885 --> 19:43.011
and then we'll just‐‐

19:43.095 --> 19:44.763
‐Hey, guys. ‐Hey!

19:44.888 --> 19:46.098
Where'd everybody go?

19:46.140 --> 19:48.020
Shaun White was doing
some sort of fondue thing,

19:48.142 --> 19:49.143
so everyone hit that up.

19:50.144 --> 19:51.204
Hey, you don't have to do that,

19:51.228 --> 19:53.397
I got somebody to take
care of it, I told you.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.649
Yeah, us.

19:55.732 --> 19:56.650
That's the deal.

19:56.733 --> 19:57.526
You okay, boss?

19:57.651 --> 19:59.111
You been acting
like kind of strange

19:59.153 --> 20:00.154
since you got back.

20:00.237 --> 20:01.237
Yeah, we saw you upstairs

20:01.280 --> 20:02.382
kind of kicking the
shit out of Destiny,

20:02.406 --> 20:04.533
I didn't want to ask, but...

20:04.616 --> 20:06.952
That... that doll's
name is Destiny?

20:06.994 --> 20:09.079
‐Yeah, that's her name. ‐Yeah.

20:09.121 --> 20:10.998
‐That's my bae? ‐Yeah.

20:11.081 --> 20:13.584
No judgment, you know,
you're the man, JFUTZ.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.127
So the place is all clean

20:15.252 --> 20:16.604
and I have a plan to
celebrate my birthday

20:16.628 --> 20:18.964
with a couple friends, so
going to boogie, all right?

20:19.006 --> 20:20.340
Yeah.

20:20.382 --> 20:22.885
You guys work for me.

20:23.010 --> 20:24.136
Yeah.

20:24.219 --> 20:26.263
We do‐‐what...
what's going on, man?

20:28.223 --> 20:29.391
‐All right. ‐We good?

20:29.516 --> 20:30.726
‐We're out. ‐Yeah.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.895
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

20:43.906 --> 20:46.658
‐This is not a sweet condo.
‐You've got a lot of nerve

20:46.742 --> 20:48.118
showing up here, mister.

20:48.202 --> 20:49.745
Dad, what‐‐what is this place?

20:49.828 --> 20:51.872
Very funny, you're
a wisenheimer now?

20:51.997 --> 20:53.457
Why are you even here?

20:53.499 --> 20:55.709
I'm here to see you and Mom.

20:55.751 --> 20:57.479
You're full of them today,
you're a regular comedian.

20:57.503 --> 20:58.462
You know what?

20:58.504 --> 20:59.606
You're funnier than
the entertainment

20:59.630 --> 21:00.506
they have in this prison,

21:00.631 --> 21:02.341
which is no
entertainment at all.

21:02.382 --> 21:03.634
We can't even get cable!

21:03.717 --> 21:05.761
Cable, the thing no one
even wants anymore.

21:05.886 --> 21:07.471
Wait, Dad, wait, where's Mom?

21:07.513 --> 21:10.516
She didn't want to talk to you
and I don't blame her.

21:10.599 --> 21:12.351
That house was going
to be yours one day.

21:12.392 --> 21:13.602
It's the Futterman house,

21:13.644 --> 21:16.104
but you just couldn't
wait, could you?

21:16.146 --> 21:17.981
I'm‐‐I'm sorry.

21:18.023 --> 21:20.776
Dad, that‐‐that wasn't me.

21:20.859 --> 21:21.777
It's my fault.

21:21.860 --> 21:23.529
We never should have
named you Joosh.

21:23.612 --> 21:25.864
You were made fun of as a kid
and it hardened your heart.

21:25.906 --> 21:28.158
But we were inspired
by that Latino fellow

21:28.242 --> 21:29.493
that threw up on my carpet

21:29.618 --> 21:33.455
‐and introduced us.
‐The Latino thing again?

21:33.497 --> 21:34.623
It doesn't matter.

21:34.748 --> 21:38.627
You're more JFUTZ
than Joosh now.

21:38.710 --> 21:39.586
No.

21:39.628 --> 21:40.754
No, no, no, I'm Joosh‐‐

21:40.879 --> 21:42.839
I'm the same sweet Joosh
that you remember, Dad.

21:42.881 --> 21:44.341
You got a court
order declaring us

21:44.383 --> 21:45.634
mentally incompetent

21:45.717 --> 21:47.219
and putting us in this place.

21:47.261 --> 21:49.221
You don't get
to call me "Dad" anymore.

21:50.847 --> 21:51.848
Here, let me, let me‐‐

21:51.890 --> 21:53.225
I don't want your money,

21:53.267 --> 21:54.643
dirty money that corrupted you.

21:54.726 --> 21:56.520
You used to play
video games for fun.

21:56.645 --> 21:57.980
Then you got a taste of success

21:58.021 --> 22:00.023
and the hangers‐on
started rushing in,

22:00.107 --> 22:01.858
and you liked it.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.860
I was never popular as a kid.

22:03.902 --> 22:06.029
You had two best friends,
me and your mom,

22:06.154 --> 22:08.532
but that wasn't
good enough for you.

22:08.615 --> 22:09.783
Great.

22:09.908 --> 22:12.119
I punched turkey chili,
it gave me split pea.

22:12.202 --> 22:14.621
Okay, look, just go
get Mom and let's go home.

22:14.705 --> 22:15.497
‐No. ‐Come on.

22:15.622 --> 22:17.708
Let it go‐‐ Jesus Christ!

22:17.749 --> 22:19.352
Great, there goes the dinner
I didn't even want.

22:19.376 --> 22:21.878
You know what, just get
the hell out of here.

22:21.962 --> 22:24.006
Get out, do I have
to call security?

22:24.089 --> 22:25.382
Do I need to kick your ass?

22:25.465 --> 22:27.443
It's what I should have done
years ago, get out of here.

22:27.467 --> 22:28.844
Go!

22:28.885 --> 22:30.387
Get the fuck out.

23:19.978 --> 23:21.229
Who sent you?

23:21.271 --> 23:22.522
Bamboo union?

23:22.648 --> 23:23.982
Ghost Shadows?

23:24.024 --> 23:26.485
Who?

23:26.526 --> 23:28.153
Clone assassin?

23:28.278 --> 23:29.613
It's brilliant.

23:29.655 --> 23:32.866
‐Leave it to the Triads.
‐I'm‐‐I'm...

23:32.908 --> 23:35.243
wait, what?

23:35.327 --> 23:38.372
Hachi machi!

23:38.455 --> 23:40.749
They told me it was impossible.

23:40.874 --> 23:43.126
Hey, eyes up here!

23:43.210 --> 23:44.586
You're an asshole.

23:44.628 --> 23:46.380
How could you do that
to our parents?

23:46.463 --> 23:48.507
"Our" parents?

23:48.632 --> 23:50.884
Don't try to get
in my head, clone.

23:51.009 --> 23:54.096
You tell your bosses I ain't
throwing no tournaments.

23:54.137 --> 23:55.764
There's a little thing
called integrity

23:55.889 --> 23:57.391
when it comes to e‐sports.

23:57.516 --> 24:00.894
Doesn't matter how much
they try to intimidate me.

24:00.977 --> 24:04.147
‐And that thing is intimidating.
‐Dude.

24:04.231 --> 24:06.149
I‐I'm not your clone assassin.

24:06.233 --> 24:08.652
I'm from another timeline,
only where I come from,

24:08.777 --> 24:12.656
I have <i>this</i> dick
but I'm not <i>a</i> dick.

24:12.739 --> 24:16.243
Nice line, fake me.

24:16.368 --> 24:18.870
But I've been up
for 39 hours straight

24:18.995 --> 24:21.873
and I'm still going strong.

24:23.583 --> 24:24.710
God.

24:26.837 --> 24:29.756
I would probably cut back
on the JOOSH, Joosh.

24:29.881 --> 24:32.134
It's JFUTZ, bitch.

24:37.514 --> 24:39.474
Did you just slap my nose?

24:39.516 --> 24:41.518
‐ ‐‐ho‐ho.

24:41.601 --> 24:42.978
Big mistake!

24:51.361 --> 24:53.405
I killed JFUTZ!

24:53.530 --> 24:55.282
All right.

24:55.407 --> 24:58.118
You think you can handle
this much C‐4, soldier?

24:58.243 --> 25:00.746
Well, as long as
we're working together,

25:00.829 --> 25:02.309
there's no amount of
ammonium chlorate

25:02.372 --> 25:03.874
‐I can't carry. ‐All right.

25:03.957 --> 25:05.083
‐Let's get to it. ‐Guys.

25:05.125 --> 25:07.377
Guys, stop, stop, stop, stop.

25:07.461 --> 25:08.378
Josh, out of our way.

25:08.462 --> 25:09.588
We got a tower to take down.

25:09.629 --> 25:11.131
Look, I'm here to help.

25:11.214 --> 25:12.257
Okay, I was wrong.

25:12.382 --> 25:14.134
I‐‐I belong with you guys
here in this sewer

25:14.217 --> 25:16.636
and not in some
fireproof palace.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.763
Sweet callback.

25:17.846 --> 25:20.766
Look, I'm in this with you guys.

25:20.849 --> 25:22.142
Till the end.

25:22.225 --> 25:23.477
Okay.

25:23.518 --> 25:25.103
I'm gonna whip
you up a C‐4 belt.

25:25.145 --> 25:27.522
No‐‐no, no, no.

25:27.606 --> 25:29.399
We don't have to die.

25:29.483 --> 25:30.776
I've got a plan.

25:35.655 --> 25:37.657
How is this possible?

25:37.741 --> 25:38.784
So in this timeline,

25:38.909 --> 25:40.577
the one where I never
worked at Kronish,

25:40.619 --> 25:43.121
the one where I never
played The Biotic Wars,

25:43.205 --> 25:45.957
no one has beaten this game.

25:45.999 --> 25:48.251
I Bloogled it on my Blapple.

25:48.376 --> 25:49.503
So?

25:49.586 --> 25:52.255
So‐‐so that means that there's
another version of you two

25:52.339 --> 25:53.131
in the future,

25:53.256 --> 25:56.760
waiting to come back for me.

25:56.885 --> 25:57.969
Guys.

25:58.011 --> 26:00.263
This is an entirely
different reality.

26:00.347 --> 26:02.390
Your whole team
can still be alive.

26:04.100 --> 26:07.395
Look, all I have to do
is go and beat the game again

26:07.479 --> 26:09.648
and we get another
Tiger and another Wolf

26:09.731 --> 26:11.149
and who knows who else.

26:11.274 --> 26:12.400
No, it'll just be us.

26:12.526 --> 26:14.152
They'll all die in the tunnel...

26:14.236 --> 26:15.153
again.

26:15.237 --> 26:16.655
Groundhog Day.

26:16.738 --> 26:17.906
Andie MacDowell.

26:18.031 --> 26:19.658
‐I hit that. ‐No.

26:19.783 --> 26:22.953
They don't have to die.

26:22.994 --> 26:24.120
We can send them a message

26:24.246 --> 26:25.247
through the game,

26:25.330 --> 26:27.999
tell them to go a different way.

26:28.083 --> 26:30.335
You guys, we can get
the entire team back.

26:30.377 --> 26:32.128
Mongoose, Butterfly, Owl,

26:32.212 --> 26:35.257
before he got that
brainworm thing.

26:35.340 --> 26:36.340
Myrm.

26:36.383 --> 26:37.634
He was myrmed.

26:37.717 --> 26:38.717
Yes.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.262
How would you guys like

26:40.387 --> 26:42.389
a pre‐myrm Owl?

26:45.392 --> 26:48.144
"Avoid‐The‐Tunnel."

26:48.228 --> 26:49.145
See?

26:49.229 --> 26:52.899
Now the future yous will
take a different way in.

26:52.983 --> 26:54.651
Play the Death Bridge.

26:54.776 --> 26:56.278
They should be so lucky.

26:56.361 --> 26:57.529
I'm Tiger.

26:57.654 --> 26:58.780
This is Wolf.

26:58.864 --> 27:00.115
You're our newest recruit.

27:00.156 --> 27:01.283
Come fight.

27:01.366 --> 27:03.952
Welcome to the Resistance.

27:03.994 --> 27:05.996
Let's fuck this place up.

27:06.121 --> 27:07.956
Murder everyone!

27:07.998 --> 27:09.374
Break their bodies!

27:12.335 --> 27:14.754
Juice me, juice me!

27:16.006 --> 27:18.508
Certified organic
by Orient Health.

27:20.594 --> 27:21.887
Blow them back to hell!

27:22.012 --> 27:23.865
Everyone's going to be
peckish when they arrive.

27:23.889 --> 27:25.390
Don't want to give
them palate shock,

27:25.473 --> 27:28.643
so best stick to
simple hors d'oeuvres.

27:28.768 --> 27:29.996
Don't know how
I'm going to do that

27:30.020 --> 27:34.107
without a melon baller,
but I suppose I'll make do.

27:34.149 --> 27:36.276
Make it rain blood!

27:36.401 --> 27:38.153
You got any crème fraîche?

27:38.236 --> 27:39.654
No.

27:47.704 --> 27:48.747
Level 83.

27:48.872 --> 27:51.374
All I have to do

27:51.499 --> 27:55.712
is shed all of my
armor and weapons,

27:55.754 --> 27:58.840
take the secret passageway
past the Jizzadrian kill squad,

27:58.882 --> 27:59.841
dodge those perfs,

27:59.883 --> 28:02.510
that leads directly
to the big boss.

28:02.594 --> 28:07.641
Okay, Dr. Genocide,
slit his evil throat.

28:07.766 --> 28:09.601
Hit the detonator,

28:09.643 --> 28:12.145
slide down the fire tube
without being burned alive,

28:12.270 --> 28:16.107
all before the kill scraper

28:16.149 --> 28:17.776
explodes.

28:22.864 --> 28:24.115
Congratulations.

28:24.157 --> 28:27.243
You've achieved
the ranking of savior.

28:27.327 --> 28:29.329
All right,
it should work, that's it.

28:29.371 --> 28:30.473
You‐‐you think
I made enough food?

28:30.497 --> 28:31.456
You know what, I don't,

28:31.498 --> 28:32.975
but I didn't want
to say anything, Wolf.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.101
All right, there's like
a little bit of lag time,

28:34.125 --> 28:36.002
but it'll happen any moment now.

28:36.086 --> 28:37.128
Okay, we need to back up.

28:37.212 --> 28:40.131
There are about to be
45 bloodthirsty warriors

28:40.215 --> 28:41.591
up in this piece.
