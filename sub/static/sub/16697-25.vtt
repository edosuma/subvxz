Just try a bite.

00:06.572 --> 00:08.073
But I hate it.

Corn is fun. Watch.

I'm pretending
I'm a typewriter.

00:21.553 --> 00:23.088
Yeah.

Ding!

00:25.324 --> 00:26.793

old-fashioned computer.

00:32.664 --> 00:34.567
Oh! I still hate corn.

00:58.756 --> 01:00.692
I got it.

Okay and these are
antiseptic wipes, Band-Aids,
and here's sunscreen.

01:04.328 --> 01:06.533
Okay. And where's
the plastic bubble
you keep Ruby in?

Okay, you know what?
Three kids. No kids.

Well look how
dangerous they are.

Yeah.

Hey, honey.
I was thinking.

Mother's Day is
only a week away.

anything yet?

Oh, come on.
Hey, have you gotten me
anything for Mother's Day?

02:02.555 --> 02:05.625
Honey, don't worry.
I always get you something.
I always come through.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.394
Well, you know,
what about the lingerie
I got you last year?

02:08.425 --> 02:09.695
From the gas station?

02:11.229 --> 02:12.899
All right, anyway,
I know what I want.
This.

02:14.199 --> 02:15.268
What's this?

02:15.300 --> 02:16.635
It's a pedometer.
It counts your steps.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.905
Just hook it on
to your belt and walk.

02:18.937 --> 02:22.407
All right.
But when I give it to you
next week, act surprised.

No! It's for you.

02:22.441 --> 02:24.911
What?

02:24.943 --> 02:27.579
You know how
the doctor said you need
to get more exercise?

The gift I want for
Mother's Day is for you
to walk more.

Cheryl, I am in
the construction industry.

02:32.418 --> 02:33.920
I am in great shape.

What shape is that?
A circle?

Come on.

02:41.426 --> 02:42.794
It's only 80,000 steps.

That's just
10,000 steps a day
till Mother's Day.

02:45.864 --> 02:47.599
How far is 10,000 steps?

02:47.633 --> 02:49.235
About five miles.

Five miles a day?

right next to us, so...

this call,

both of them to the park?

09:16.020 --> 09:18.790
you've taken only Ruby
to the park.

09:18.823 --> 09:20.959
Now you're stealing
Ruby's artwork.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.361
I don't know
what's going on here,

09:22.394 --> 09:24.830
but if you're
making a buck,
I want my cut.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.900
Jim, I'm not
doing anything.

09:28.933 --> 09:31.002
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.139
Spill, baby.

09:35.206 --> 09:36.942
Okay. Ruby stays
with me.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.078
(SIGHS)

09:41.413 --> 09:43.916
Fine.

09:41.413 --> 09:43.916
Uh-huh. What's up?

09:44.950 --> 09:46.352
(SIGHS)

09:46.384 --> 09:49.621
There's this single father
at the park that
I really like.

09:49.654 --> 09:53.225
And he kind of assumed
that Ruby was
my daughter and so...

09:53.859 --> 09:54.994
She is.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.230
So you have deliberately
deceived someone

09:59.264 --> 10:01.100
for your own
selfish reasons?

10:02.134 --> 10:03.369
Hmm.

10:03.402 --> 10:06.639
I respect that.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.274
Please don't tell Cheryl.
I just... I can't stand
to hear her speech about

10:09.307 --> 10:10.975
being the real you,
you know?

10:11.009 --> 10:12.945
It's like the push-up bra
conversation all over again.

10:12.977 --> 10:14.245
Mmm-hmm.

10:14.278 --> 10:16.881
Hmm. That's interesting.

10:16.914 --> 10:19.150
You want something from me

10:19.183 --> 10:21.786
and I want
something from you.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.722
What?

10:23.754 --> 10:25.658
You want me to do
your walking for you?

10:25.691 --> 10:27.927
Hey, I'm sparing you
the pain of childbirth.

10:30.227 --> 10:31.896
Jim, this is
all you've done?

10:31.929 --> 10:33.732
Glaciers move
faster than this!

10:34.865 --> 10:36.901
Dance, monkey, dance.

10:36.934 --> 10:38.069
And another one
right here.

10:38.102 --> 10:39.170
Bye.

10:40.471 --> 10:43.141
Okay. 3:00 class.
Let's move!

10:49.181 --> 10:53.319
Eye contact!
Eye contact!

11:01.726 --> 11:04.395
Ruby! Come on,
sweetie, we gotta go.

11:04.428 --> 11:07.365
No, no. Ruby's down
at the park with Dana.

11:07.399 --> 11:09.368
What? She has
tumbling class.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.435
Since when?

11:11.202 --> 11:12.937
Only the last two years.

11:14.306 --> 11:15.908
Any good?

11:14.306 --> 11:15.908
No.

11:17.942 --> 11:20.846
Well, there's $25
down the drain.

11:20.879 --> 11:24.249
Twenty-five dollars for
a tumbling class and I can't
get the good bologna?

11:24.282 --> 11:25.918
Oh...

11:25.951 --> 11:28.320
No, no, no.
She's not missing
any class.

11:28.352 --> 11:29.822
I'm gonna go get her.

11:31.089 --> 11:33.058
(GASPS)

11:33.091 --> 11:35.427
What happened
to the window?

11:35.460 --> 11:37.363
Oh, um, uh...

11:38.363 --> 11:39.699
Gracie did it.

11:42.466 --> 11:44.369
Gracie!

11:44.402 --> 11:45.805
(LAUGHING)

11:51.176 --> 11:52.411
Jim! What're you
doing here?

11:52.443 --> 11:54.112
I'm here to take Ruby.
She's got tumbling class.

11:54.145 --> 11:56.481
No, no, no, no.
Michael's not here yet.
She can miss a lesson.

11:56.514 --> 11:58.516
Not for 25 bucks a class!

11:58.549 --> 12:00.384
Jim!

11:58.549 --> 12:00.384
Come on, this is
not like school

12:00.418 --> 12:01.519
where you can take
them out for free.

12:01.552 --> 12:02.821
Jim...

12:02.854 --> 12:04.757
RUBY: Daddy!

12:04.789 --> 12:05.957
That's my girl.
Come on, we got to
go to tumbling class.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.458
Jim, this isn't fair.
We had a deal.

12:07.491 --> 12:08.894
Dana, I want my kid.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.229
No!

12:08.927 --> 12:10.229
I want my kid, Dana.

12:10.261 --> 12:12.029
No!

12:10.261 --> 12:12.029
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

12:12.062 --> 12:14.365
Everything okay here?

12:12.062 --> 12:14.365
Hi, Michael.
Yeah. Yeah.

12:14.399 --> 12:17.068
Everything's fine.
Um, Ruby go play
with Olivia.

12:17.101 --> 12:20.004
(STAMMERING)

12:17.101 --> 12:20.004
So this is the famous ex?

12:21.373 --> 12:22.742
Ex?

12:24.176 --> 12:25.511
I thought you were
still in prison.

12:25.543 --> 12:27.111
What?

12:27.144 --> 12:29.347
Uh, Michael,
can you just
give us a second?

12:29.380 --> 12:30.850
Are you sure?

12:29.380 --> 12:30.850
Yeah.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.485
Okay.

12:33.518 --> 12:35.988
But if there's
any trouble,
I'm stepping in.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.524
Even though he's
bigger than me
and looks like a biter.

12:39.924 --> 12:41.894
Hey, I've been
in prison, buddy.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.462
What the hell
have you been
telling this guy?

12:44.495 --> 12:46.564
Somebody had to be
the bad guy
in this divorce.

12:46.597 --> 12:49.033
At least I said you
never hit me...sober.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.269
(SIGHS)

12:50.302 --> 12:51.269
Jeez, Dana,
couldn't you just say,

12:51.302 --> 12:53.538
we married young
and drifted apart?

12:53.572 --> 12:57.308
Jim, I'm begging you.
Don't blow this for me.
I really like this guy.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.843
Listen, we're going
on a date on Sunday.

12:58.876 --> 13:00.378
He's taking me to brunch
at the Fairmark,

13:00.412 --> 13:02.480
then we're gonna go
for a ride on
the merry-go-round

13:02.514 --> 13:04.283
and I'm gonna tell him
the whole truth then.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.951
Dana, Sunday
is Mother's Day.

13:08.086 --> 13:09.153
Mother's Day?

13:09.187 --> 13:10.288
Yes, Dana.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.423
Oh, my God!

13:12.456 --> 13:16.160
Oh, that's so sweet!

13:16.193 --> 13:18.863
Oh, he wanted Ruby and I
to have a special day

13:18.897 --> 13:21.801
so we didn't have to
spend it in our depressing
government housing.

13:24.068 --> 13:25.336
Government housing?

13:25.370 --> 13:27.438
Well, if you paid
child support...

13:27.471 --> 13:28.874
I was in prison!

13:28.907 --> 13:30.009
Huh?

13:31.408 --> 13:33.611
Dana, you cannot have
Ruby on Mother's Day.

13:33.644 --> 13:36.114
I have to have Ruby
on Mother's Day.
I'm her mother!

13:36.147 --> 13:37.416
Okay. Now, you're
getting really weird.

13:37.448 --> 13:38.583
This is getting creepy.
Wait...

13:37.448 --> 13:38.583
Look, come on...

13:38.616 --> 13:40.218
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Easy!

13:40.251 --> 13:41.986
I didn't touch her.

13:40.251 --> 13:41.986
We're fine.

13:42.019 --> 13:44.155
Amicable divorce.
We're fine.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.292
Jim...

13:45.990 --> 13:47.292
You can't.

13:47.325 --> 13:49.595
Listen. You let
Cheryl sleep in,

13:49.628 --> 13:51.530
I sneak Ruby out
for a couple of hours,

13:51.562 --> 13:52.997
and then everybody wins.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.432
Everybody wins?

13:55.533 --> 13:56.601
(SIGHS)

13:56.634 --> 13:57.936
Fine. I'll give
you the money

13:57.969 --> 14:00.339
for Ruby's tumbling
class that she missed.

14:00.371 --> 14:03.308
What? You think
I'm in the business
of renting my kids out?

14:04.576 --> 14:05.610
A hundred bucks.

14:05.644 --> 14:06.945
(SCOFFS)

14:06.977 --> 14:09.280
Plus, I'll throw in
10,000 extra steps.

14:09.313 --> 14:11.182
Well, I'd be stupid
not to take that.

14:14.219 --> 14:15.287
What a jerk!

14:15.320 --> 14:16.889
Yeah.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.224
I don't pay
any attention to him.

14:19.256 --> 14:21.492
JIM: Hey, sweetheart,
keep those legs moving.

14:21.525 --> 14:23.862
I want 90,000 by Sunday.

14:27.365 --> 14:29.268
He thinks I'm
a little chunky.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.010
Okay, okay.

14:39.043 --> 14:42.480
Now, do you understand
how we play
this little game?

14:42.514 --> 14:45.984
Yeah. It's Mother's Day,
so I call
all the ladies "Mommy."

14:46.017 --> 14:48.220
Very good.

14:48.253 --> 14:51.156
Now, remember,
if you do a good job
with the game,

14:51.188 --> 14:53.391
I'm gonna give you
a whole dollar.

14:53.424 --> 14:56.694
Can I get
a lollipop, too?

14:56.727 --> 15:00.198
All right. But it's gonna
come out of your dollar.

15:05.169 --> 15:07.305
Hi, Mommy!

15:05.169 --> 15:07.305
Oh, perfect.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.241
Oh, my God!
What is she wearing?

15:09.274 --> 15:11.176
What? That's fine.

15:11.208 --> 15:15.046
Jim, I did not walk
all night to have
my daughter leave this house

15:15.080 --> 15:17.716
looking like
a stolen car!

15:17.749 --> 15:21.552
Well, why don't you
just go wake up Cheryl
and have her change Ruby?

15:21.586 --> 15:23.555
She's awake.
What's going on?

15:23.587 --> 15:25.557
Oh, my God.
Cheryl!

15:25.590 --> 15:27.125
Cheryl...

15:27.158 --> 15:29.293
Oh! You're gonna ruin
the big Mother's Day
surprise.

15:29.326 --> 15:31.429
Yes!

15:31.462 --> 15:33.966
All right,
nobody come out now!

15:33.999 --> 15:35.600
We're sticking
with the original plan!

15:35.633 --> 15:37.035
(SHUSHING)

15:37.067 --> 15:39.037
All right, why is Ruby
dressed like this?

15:39.070 --> 15:41.206
Because Mommy's
taking me out
to breakfast.

15:42.106 --> 15:43.341
Mommy?

15:45.576 --> 15:48.080
Okay. Sweetie,
well, why don't
you go inside?

15:48.580 --> 15:49.615
Okay.

15:51.216 --> 15:52.717
So, who wants
to go first?

15:53.551 --> 15:54.720
Hmm...

15:54.753 --> 15:56.989
How about...

15:57.022 --> 15:58.323
How about the one
my daughter calls Mommy

15:58.355 --> 15:59.958
wearing my husband's
pedometer?

16:01.225 --> 16:04.062
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
Okay. Um...

16:04.095 --> 16:06.731
Okay, Cheryl,
you know how sometimes
you meet a really cute guy

16:06.764 --> 16:08.432
and you lie
about your age?

16:08.466 --> 16:11.470
Well, that's all I did
except I threw in
a daughter.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.437
Ah.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.437
Dana!

16:13.471 --> 16:15.774
Oh, except I told
the truth about my age,
so points for me.

16:15.807 --> 16:17.475
There you go.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.378
All right. But why
is she wearing
your pedometer?

16:19.410 --> 16:21.245
And why are you
wearing my robe?

16:22.246 --> 16:23.347
This is my robe!

16:23.381 --> 16:25.349
Well, I think
you've answered
your own question then!

16:25.383 --> 16:26.451
Jim!

16:26.484 --> 16:27.451
What?

16:27.485 --> 16:29.653
I did his walking for him
in exchange for Ruby.

16:29.687 --> 16:31.590
(CHERYL GASPS)

16:31.623 --> 16:33.258
I don't believe you.
That was supposed to be
my Mother's Day gift!

16:33.291 --> 16:35.094
Well, I got 100 bucks, too.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.764
You rented our daughter?

16:38.797 --> 16:42.734
Well, it's not like your
high morals are bringing
any money into our house.

16:42.767 --> 16:45.637
I'm sorry, Cheryl.
I don't know
what I was thinking.

16:45.669 --> 16:50.375
Oh, Dana. Sweetie,
you don't have to lie.

16:50.408 --> 16:52.677
When are you ever gonna
learn that true love...

16:50.408 --> 16:52.677
(GROANS) Okay!

16:52.710 --> 16:54.546
Here we go! Okay!

16:54.578 --> 16:57.114
The wise and perfect
Cheryl's gonna
judge me again.

16:57.148 --> 16:59.317
Honey, I'm not
judging you.

16:59.350 --> 17:02.421
And I wouldn't have to
if you weren't afraid
to be yourself.

17:02.453 --> 17:05.723
Cheryl, you don't know
what it's like.
You're not still single.

17:05.757 --> 17:08.693
You have the luxury
of being yourself because
you married beneath you.

17:13.664 --> 17:15.067
No offense, Jim.

17:15.098 --> 17:17.135
None taken.
I married up.

17:20.105 --> 17:23.141
Dana, you've got to
stop trying to be me.

17:23.173 --> 17:26.545
If you keep trying
to be Cheryl, you know
who you're gonna attract?

17:26.577 --> 17:27.744
Jim!

17:28.846 --> 17:31.049
Accept no substitutes.

17:33.451 --> 17:36.387
You know what I think?
I think you love it
when I screw up.

17:36.421 --> 17:39.423
Because then you can get on
your high horse and wag
your little finger at me.

17:39.457 --> 17:40.759
That is so not true!

17:40.791 --> 17:42.394
(STAMMERING)
You keep saying...

17:42.426 --> 17:43.528
See? Finger!

17:42.426 --> 17:43.528
Oh...

17:43.560 --> 17:44.596
No, that's a finger.

17:44.628 --> 17:47.498
Well, you know what?

17:47.531 --> 17:50.368
You won. I lost.
You are right again.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.471
Yeah.

17:52.503 --> 17:53.738
(SCOFFS)

17:53.771 --> 17:57.108
Okay, great. Well,
consider it my Mother's
Day present to you.

17:58.276 --> 17:59.745
Eye contact!

18:01.778 --> 18:05.450
Everyone in your family
throws things
without eye contact.

18:05.482 --> 18:06.884
Oh, look at this.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.820
Wow, she walked
the whole 40 miles.

18:09.854 --> 18:11.590
She walked 40 miles
for this guy?

18:11.623 --> 18:14.392
Yeah. You know what?
He was a pretty
good guy, too.

18:14.424 --> 18:18.463
You should have seen the way
he stood up against her,
like, jerk ex-husband.

18:19.497 --> 18:20.565
What ex-husband?

18:20.597 --> 18:22.334
Me, Cheryl.

18:22.366 --> 18:23.769
Keep up. Keep up.

18:33.711 --> 18:36.481
Okay. So, who are you?

18:37.714 --> 18:39.250
Well, um...

18:40.718 --> 18:42.687
I'm neurotic.

18:42.720 --> 18:46.790
I'm a little insecure
and totally snore.

18:46.824 --> 18:50.729
I have a little bit
of a shoe habit,
but it's under control.

18:50.761 --> 18:53.131
Mostly. Okay,
not at all.

18:53.730 --> 18:57.469
Oh, and I'm unemployed.

18:57.501 --> 19:03.575
Well, I think you
left out smart,
funny, and beautiful.

19:06.376 --> 19:07.878
Well, you didn't
let me finish.

19:07.912 --> 19:09.713
(LAUGHS)

19:09.747 --> 19:12.317
Dana, here's
your little Ruby.

19:09.747 --> 19:12.317
Hi!

19:12.349 --> 19:14.251
She wanted to be
with her real mom
on Mother's Day.

19:14.285 --> 19:16.521
I'm her stepmom.
Try following that act.

19:16.554 --> 19:18.323
Cheryl...

19:16.554 --> 19:18.323
You know, I tried
to buy her love

19:18.355 --> 19:20.392
with gifts and toys,
but she would
have none of it.

19:20.424 --> 19:22.693
You raised her too well.

19:22.727 --> 19:24.263
I told Michael the truth.

19:25.529 --> 19:26.632
Oh?

19:27.498 --> 19:29.334
Oh!

19:29.366 --> 19:32.171
Well, how was I?
Because I did some
acting in high school.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.874
I'm Cheryl,
Dana's sister.

19:35.906 --> 19:36.942
Nice to meet you.

19:36.974 --> 19:38.409
Yeah. You, too.

19:38.442 --> 19:40.645
Well, Ruby,
why don't we go?

19:42.313 --> 19:45.350
So, uh,
Jim's really your...

19:45.383 --> 19:46.851
Yeah.

19:46.884 --> 19:48.286
But he's so...

19:46.884 --> 19:48.286
I know.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.188
And you're so...

19:48.318 --> 19:50.188
Thank you.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.461
All right, buddy.
Showtime.

19:59.529 --> 20:00.932
What's Andy doing
with Kyle?

20:02.900 --> 20:04.803
Would you stop
renting our kids?

20:07.005 --> 20:11.443
Well, doesn't look like
Dana's in the fetal position,
so I guess everything's okay?

20:11.476 --> 20:12.644
Yeah.

20:13.411 --> 20:14.446
Are you okay?

20:14.479 --> 20:15.547
Yeah.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.581
Good.

20:17.615 --> 20:19.584
All right, well,
let's go home then.

20:19.616 --> 20:24.588
The girls really want to make
their jelly bean omelet
for Mother's Day for you.

20:24.622 --> 20:26.791
Oh! Jellybean omelet!

20:26.824 --> 20:28.360
Mmm-hmm.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.528
Great. Let's go.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.964
Oh, come on.
I'm kidding, Mom.

20:33.998 --> 20:35.432
We'll have our table
in a minute.

20:35.465 --> 20:36.567
Really?

20:35.465 --> 20:36.567
Yeah.

20:36.601 --> 20:38.403
Oh!

20:36.601 --> 20:38.403
On one condition.

20:38.435 --> 20:39.503
What?

20:39.537 --> 20:40.672
That I walk home.

20:40.704 --> 20:41.839
Deal.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.912
Cheryl, Cheryl,
that's 10 miles.

20:47.944 --> 20:50.948
Don't you know
an empty gesture
when you hear one?

20:50.981 --> 20:54.351
Oh, honey.
You don't have to
walk anymore.

20:54.384 --> 20:55.452
Really?

20:55.486 --> 20:56.755
No.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.890
Don't you know
an empty gesture
when you hear one?

20:58.923 --> 21:00.592
(LAUGHS)

21:00.625 --> 21:02.460
Well, I just want
you to know,
for Father's Day,

21:02.492 --> 21:04.361
I want a real present.

21:04.394 --> 21:06.664
Fine, honey. We'll stop
at a gas station
on the way home.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.932
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

21:08.965 --> 21:10.334
Is that us?
Thank you.
