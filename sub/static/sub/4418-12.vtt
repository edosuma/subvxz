DURING A FIELD TRIP TODAY.

02:43.874 --> 02:45.507
HERE WITH
A SPECIAL REPORT,

02:45.509 --> 02:47.776
IS A QUADRIPLEGIC
SWISS MAN ON A PONY.

02:47.778 --> 02:49.611
THANKS TOM,
THE LITTLE 8-YEAR-OLD

02:49.613 --> 02:50.412
WAS VERY
SHOCKED INDEED

02:50.414 --> 02:53.114
WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A VERY
ANCIENT TRIANGULAR OBJECT.

02:53.116 --> 02:54.516
WELL I WAS
JUST DIGGING AROUND.

02:54.518 --> 02:56.718
I WAS LIKE, "DUDE,
I FOUND THIS TRIANGLE."

02:56.720 --> 02:58.153
AND MY FRIENDS
WERE LIKE, "DUDE."

02:58.155 --> 02:58.987
AND I WAS
ALL, "DUDE."

02:58.989 --> 03:00.722
AND I TOLD HIM,
I SAID, "KYLE,

03:00.724 --> 03:01.857
I WILL KICK YOU
IN THE NUTS."

03:01.859 --> 03:03.225
BUT HE DIDN'T
GIVE IT BACK TO ME.

03:03.227 --> 03:05.060
SO I KICKED HIM
SQUARE IN THE NUTS.

03:05.062 --> 03:07.095
AND HE CRIED
LIKE NANCY KERRIGAN.

03:07.097 --> 03:07.896

03:07.898 --> 03:08.864
SCREW YOU,

09:05.255 --> 09:07.755
HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN CURIOUS
ABOUT THE INSANITY

09:07.757 --> 09:09.157
BARBRA STREISAND
EXHIBITS ?

09:09.159 --> 09:11.860
WELL, I ALWAYS HEARD
SHE WAS KIND OF A BITCH.

09:11.862 --> 09:13.027
MORE THAN
A BITCH, CHEF.

09:13.029 --> 09:15.763
SHE'S A CALCULATING,
SELF-CENTERED,
EGOTISTICAL BITCH.

09:15.765 --> 09:18.766
SHE WAS BORN IN A SMALL TOWN,
HER MOTHER WAS A JACKAL

09:18.768 --> 09:20.802
AND HER FATHER WAS
AN INSURANCE SALESMAN.

09:20.804 --> 09:23.004
OOH, INSURANCE SALESMAN ?

09:23.006 --> 09:23.771
WHEN SHE WAS FIVE

09:23.773 --> 09:25.807
SHE KNEW THAT SHE WANTED
TO BE A FAMOUS SINGER.

09:25.809 --> 09:26.908
BUT BY THE TIME
SHE WAS SIX

09:26.910 --> 09:28.810
HER AMBITIOUS BECAME
TO RULE THE UNIVERSE.

09:28.812 --> 09:30.411
SHE LEARNED OF
AN ANCIENT DIAMOND,

09:30.413 --> 09:31.479
THE DIAMOND
OF PANTHEOUS

09:31.481 --> 09:33.014
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
NEVERMIND.

09:33.016 --> 09:35.650
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ALL THIS,
FORGET I ASKED.

09:35.652 --> 09:37.685
BEFORE SHE WAS SEVEN
THE KEEPERS OF PANTHEOUS

09:37.687 --> 09:39.654
LEARNED OF THIS INSANE
LITTLE GIRL'S WISH.

09:39.656 --> 09:40.622
THE DIAMOND
WAS SPLIT UP

09:40.624 --> 09:42.123
AND BURIED AT OPPOSITE
ENDS OF THE WORLD.

09:42.125 --> 09:43.992
BUT THEN, DURING THE SHOOTING
OF "MY FAIR LADY",

09:43.994 --> 09:45.827
BARBRA STREISAND FOUND
ONE OF THE TRIANGLES.

09:45.829 --> 09:49.063
AND THE OTHER TRIANGLE IS
THE ONE THAT LITTLE KYLE HAS ?

09:49.065 --> 09:49.797
YES, MR. CHEF.

09:49.799 --> 09:51.866
IF BABS GETS AHOLD
OF THAT OTHER TRIANGLE

09:51.868 --> 09:52.800
SHE WILL
FULFILL HER PROPHECY

09:52.802 --> 09:56.871
AND BECOME THE MOST
THREATENING THING

THE HELL<i> THAT</i> MEANS

10:01.511 --> 10:04.545
BUT IT DOESN'T
SOUND GOOD.

10:04.981 --> 10:06.281

SURE IS LATE.

10:06.283 --> 10:08.850
I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD DO
WITH MY TRIANGLE.

10:08.852 --> 10:10.518
NOW THAT IT IS
<i>MY</i> TRIANGLE.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.255
DAMNIT, I GAVE IT TO YOU
SO YOU WOULD SHUT UP !

10:32.742 --> 10:36.911

10:36.913 --> 10:39.380
I'M SO GLAD YOU FOUND IT
BECAUSE WITHOUT IT

10:39.382 --> 10:41.549
