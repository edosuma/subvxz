- We're gonna be late!
- Ah!

03:32.980 --> 03:37.190
- (moaning in effort)
- Could you have made it any heavier?

03:37.310 --> 03:41.060
I made it the proper density
to render it indestructible.

03:41.190 --> 03:44.150
- (dog barking)
- Chuck, give me my chopper back!

03:44.280 --> 03:46.240
- Don't worry!
- It's fragile!

03:46.360 --> 03:49.400
- I got delicate fingers!
- Please! Give it now!

03:49.530 --> 03:51.610
- Cleo! No!
- Argh! I mean it!

03:51.740 --> 03:53.870
- Piers, no!
- Don't chase it!

03:54.000 --> 03:57.660
- Cleo! It's not a squirrel!
- Consider yourself unfriended.

03:57.790 --> 04:00.750
Oh no! Whoaaaa!!!

04:00.880 --> 04:03.450
(moaning)

04:03.590 --> 04:05.460
- Cleo!
- Just don't crash!

04:05.590 --> 04:09.590
- I wanna show it in one piece!
- Cleo. Come, now!

04:09.720 --> 04:12.470
Aah! We can't move here.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.640
It's infested with boys!

04:14.770 --> 04:17.769
- (kid moaning and dog barking)
- Cleo!

04:17.899 --> 04:21.260
I don't know. They seem
like they're having fun.

04:23.110 --> 04:24.650
(screaming)

04:24.780 --> 04:26.730
(giggling)

04:30.820 --> 04:33.530
(dog barking and kids moaning)

04:35.120 --> 04:38.620
- For boys.
- (still moaning)

04:38.790 --> 04:40.660
(background chatter)

04:42.130 --> 04:46.290
- Careful. It's my life's work.
- Cleo.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.830
- Stay.
- (Cleo whimpering and barking)

04:48.970 --> 04:51.290
Uh-huh. Stay. No, stay.

04:51.430 --> 04:53.340
(whimpering again)

04:53.470 --> 04:55.840
- Hurry!
- Wait up. My sock's coming off.

04:55.980 --> 04:59.840
- (both) Hi Frankie. Hi Nicky.
- Guys, want to give us a hand?

04:59.980 --> 05:02.680
Ooh! You know which one's my
favorite? The one that goes--

05:02.820 --> 05:05.690
Whoa! Slow down. I said
I'd show it, not play it.

05:05.820 --> 05:09.350
- Show, play, what's the diff?
- Jack, not a word.

05:09.490 --> 05:12.940
I'm just saying if you played some
tunes, everybody'd be your friend.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.030
I don't need to make more
friends, Jack. I've got you.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.860
Guys! Guess who's gonna play
the bugle for the class?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.420
- Jack!
- (all) Go Luke, go!

05:23.540 --> 05:26.000
- (dog barking)
- Go Luke, go! Go Luke, go!

05:26.130 --> 05:28.750
- Go Luke, go! Go Luke, go!
- Guys, quiet.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.430
Quiet. Come on.

05:31.930 --> 05:34.300
Forget it, Jack. I'm not gonna play.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.090
What's the problem, Luke?

05:36.220 --> 05:38.300
- You got cold feet?
- (laughing)

05:38.430 --> 05:40.180
I bet he doesn't even know how to play!

05:40.310 --> 05:41.340
(all laughing)

05:41.480 --> 05:43.770
Where'd you get your tuba?
In a cereal box?

05:43.900 --> 05:46.930
- I don't think he has talent.
- Do you even know what end to blow?

05:47.070 --> 05:50.600
- (playing a military melody)
- Ah...

05:55.030 --> 05:57.950
(dog barking and howling
while Luke plays the bugle)

06:04.790 --> 06:07.120
(soft music)

06:07.250 --> 06:09.880
(one after the other)
Hi, Luke.

06:10.010 --> 06:13.170
- (Cleo barking)
- Slow down Chuck!

06:13.300 --> 06:15.180
- So I can catch you!
- See?

06:15.300 --> 06:18.640
- See what?
- See? You're their hero now.

06:18.770 --> 06:21.600
- Yippee.
- Ah!

06:23.940 --> 06:26.690
If you bring Cleo
to school every day

06:26.820 --> 06:30.180
she's going to be
the smartest dog in the world!

06:30.320 --> 06:32.860
She's already the smartest dog
in the world, Frankie.

06:32.990 --> 06:36.270
Cleo! Come here girl!

06:36.410 --> 06:39.780
(kids moaning and Cleo barking)

06:39.910 --> 06:41.820
Ha-ha! That's a good girl.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.030
I'd miss you too much
to leave you at home.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.620
- Right, girl?
- (Cleo barking in agreement)

06:46.750 --> 06:50.250
Say, do you think Cleo
could guard my fort?

06:50.380 --> 06:53.340
You bet she could!
She's a great guard dog!

06:53.470 --> 06:56.300
- Right, girl?
- (Cleo barking and then farting)

06:57.810 --> 07:00.510
Aargh! Pee-ew!

07:00.640 --> 07:03.050
But you realize you actually
have to build it first?

07:03.190 --> 07:06.190
Admittedly, it is a
complicated feat of engineering.

07:06.310 --> 07:08.690
But we do have the whole
school break to do it.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.610
Yeah, right.

07:12.530 --> 07:15.150
(Cleo whimpering)

07:17.990 --> 07:21.940
Ah! So bored...

07:22.080 --> 07:23.740
Ah, me too.

07:23.870 --> 07:27.240
Do you wanna arm wrestle?

07:27.380 --> 07:31.960
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- I'm much stronger than I look.

07:32.090 --> 07:35.260
Here we go.
On the count of three.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.090
- One, two...
- Hmm!

07:38.220 --> 07:41.010
- (short laugh)
- Okay.

07:41.140 --> 07:42.930
Best two out of three?

07:43.060 --> 07:46.430
Ooh! Best three out of five.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.350
- Ah!
- (yawning in boredom)

07:50.480 --> 07:54.180
- Best four out of seven.
- (moaning)

07:54.320 --> 07:58.190
- Best... five out of nine.
- Oomph.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.650
So much snow...

08:00.780 --> 08:03.450
- (arm wrestling in background)
- So little to do.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.450
Catch snowflakes?

08:05.580 --> 08:08.540
- I'm not thirsty.
- Hey!

08:08.670 --> 08:11.290
Let's attack that fort!

08:11.420 --> 08:13.290
They're just first graders.

08:13.420 --> 08:17.210
So? That makes it a privilege
for them. And easier for us!

08:17.340 --> 08:20.090
Come on,
you little munchkins!

08:20.220 --> 08:22.460
- Defend your fort!
- (kids screaming)

08:22.600 --> 08:23.970
I'm comin' to get you!

08:24.100 --> 08:27.800
- (kids laughing)
- I got you!

08:27.940 --> 08:29.930
- Defend yourselves!
- I'm gonna get you!

08:30.060 --> 08:33.559
- (fighting yells)
- Take that! Come on!

08:33.690 --> 08:35.820
I'll get you!

08:35.950 --> 08:39.690
Best 47 outta... 93?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.950
(fighting in the background)

08:43.450 --> 08:45.110
- Got me!
- Wahoo!

08:45.250 --> 08:49.030
Where am I gonna go?
Over here. Oh, oh!

08:49.170 --> 08:52.580
- Huh? Check it out!
- What?

08:52.710 --> 08:55.580
- Should we go?
- Yeah!

08:55.710 --> 08:57.920
- (moaning in relief)
- Thank heavens.

08:58.050 --> 09:01.170
Chaaaarge!!!

09:03.600 --> 09:05.550
Hunh!!!

09:05.680 --> 09:07.510
(kids crying)

09:10.520 --> 09:13.520
(slurping and crying sounds)

09:19.740 --> 09:23.360
Milkshakes taste extra good
after a snowball fight.

09:23.490 --> 09:26.830
Too bad we had to resort
to beating first graders.

09:26.950 --> 09:31.000
Ah, they loved it. They made
me promise to do it every week!

09:31.130 --> 09:34.380
- Race ya to the bottom!
- (whistling a melody)

09:34.500 --> 09:37.540
- Go!
- (slurping)

09:37.670 --> 09:39.580
Huh?

09:39.720 --> 09:42.170
Ha! Beat ya!

09:42.300 --> 09:46.550
One... two... three.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.520
(moaning)

09:51.690 --> 09:53.510
Brain freeze.

09:53.650 --> 09:56.570
(moaning)

09:56.690 --> 09:59.940
Hey, what if we split into armies
and had a real

10:00.070 --> 10:02.060
snowball war of our own?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.610
- We've already got a bugle.
- (still moaning)

10:04.740 --> 10:06.900
- And a general.
- Huh?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.280
Me? A general?

10:09.410 --> 10:12.370
- It's your bugle.
- (moaning)

10:12.500 --> 10:14.710
I don't know about using my bugle...

10:14.840 --> 10:16.460
for a snowball fight?

10:16.590 --> 10:18.500
It's not a fight, sir.

10:18.630 --> 10:21.720
It's a war! Orders, general?

10:21.840 --> 10:23.720
Should we recruit the others, sir?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.720
Make battle plans
at the barn, sir?

10:25.850 --> 10:27.970
Well... I dunno.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.720
- But... maybe?
- (both) Yes sir!

10:31.850 --> 10:33.810
Maybe's good enough
for us, sir.

10:33.940 --> 10:36.010
We'll see you at the barn, sir!

10:37.520 --> 10:39.520
Left, right, right, right, right...

10:39.650 --> 10:42.440
Left, right, left, left...

10:42.570 --> 10:45.770
- Right, right...
- Hey, wait up!

10:45.910 --> 10:47.780
- Left...
- Hey!

10:47.910 --> 10:50.580
Right, right, right, right, left.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.820
Right, left, right.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.490
Do you think there are any
girls in this cruddy town?

10:59.630 --> 11:03.300
- I haven't seen any.
- Ugh!

11:03.430 --> 11:06.680
- Someone kill me now.
- Hut, two, three, four.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.800
- Huh?
- Hut, two, three, four.

11:08.930 --> 11:13.090
- Hut, two, three, four.
- Yuck! Gross!

11:13.230 --> 11:15.520
The smell brigade!

11:15.650 --> 11:17.520
Hut, two, three, four.

11:17.650 --> 11:20.400
Boys don't smell that bad.

11:20.530 --> 11:23.230
What she means is,
she's smelled worse.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.520
But not much!
Like blue cheese,

11:25.660 --> 11:28.190
sewers, rotting garbage,

11:28.330 --> 11:30.150
throw up, zombies,

11:30.290 --> 11:32.200
rotten eggs, poo, B.O...

11:32.330 --> 11:35.000
Ooh! I've seen that look before.

11:37.670 --> 11:40.750
- Say something.
- Nice skis.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.750
- (sighing)
- You wanna...

11:43.880 --> 11:46.590
gimme a ride?

11:46.720 --> 11:49.340
- Blech!
- (gagging sound)

11:49.470 --> 11:53.340
- Yeah. You got feet. Use 'em.
- (gagging sound)

11:53.480 --> 11:57.640
- Ah man...
- Blech!

11:57.770 --> 12:00.350
- (sighing)
- Come on, Lucy.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.230
- (short laugh)
- New girls, one.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.650
- Luke, zero.
- It's just a girl.

12:05.780 --> 12:08.860
Yeah. Whatever.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.710
(background chatter and laughter)

12:26.340 --> 12:28.880
- Why aren't you laughing?
- You're jealous 'cause I've...

12:29.010 --> 12:31.720
- Guys, guys!
Let the general talk!

12:31.850 --> 12:33.800
Third rule of engagement:

12:33.930 --> 12:36.340
We fight during daylight hours,
never at night.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.980
But how am I gonna use
my night vision goggles?

12:40.110 --> 12:41.520
Same way you always do.

12:41.650 --> 12:43.860
- Selfishly?
- (both) Good one.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.560
Well, it's only 'cause I don't
want you guys to break them!

12:46.700 --> 12:48.900
- They're super expensive.
- Guys, come on!

12:50.410 --> 12:53.330
- Thanks. Okay, 4th...
- (rattling sound)

12:54.790 --> 12:58.200
- (barking)
- It's the puppy, yuppy dog!

12:58.330 --> 13:00.160
- Cleo!
- Our canine unit.

13:00.290 --> 13:02.170
- You're a good girl!
- Oh, Cleo...

13:02.290 --> 13:04.200
Hey puppy. Hey puppy guppy.

13:04.340 --> 13:06.460
- Ah, Cleo...
- Sorry we're late.

13:06.590 --> 13:08.960
Cleo had an ''accident''.

13:09.090 --> 13:12.260
- (farting)
- That's just nasty!

13:12.390 --> 13:16.520
- Pee-ew! No poison gas allowed.
- Ew! That's so gross!

13:16.640 --> 13:18.140
(both) Oh boy, that's toxic.

13:18.270 --> 13:20.940
Oh no, I can't... breathe.

13:21.060 --> 13:25.110
- Ha-ha! Manolo passed out!
- Guys! Hey!

13:25.230 --> 13:27.610
I hope you guys didn't start
talking about my fort

13:27.740 --> 13:29.560
because I've got new plans.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.490
Forget the fort, Four-Eyes.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.450
- It's dumb.
- (background chatter)

13:34.580 --> 13:36.820
Mrumph! Not as dumb as
your ideas, Manolo.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.080
- Oh yeah? You wanna fight?
- (background chatter)

13:39.210 --> 13:41.500
Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Come on.

13:41.630 --> 13:46.170
- Go get 'im, Frankie.
- We should just call the vote.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.500
(insulting and taunting
in the background)

13:52.640 --> 13:56.050
Sorry. HEY!!!

13:56.180 --> 13:58.170
(tapping gently)

14:00.230 --> 14:03.980
Right.
So, we're gonna vote on the rules.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.810
- What vote?
- What rules?

14:05.940 --> 14:08.230
Are we gonna have to
start all over again?

14:08.360 --> 14:10.690
You should!
We're part of this, too!

14:10.820 --> 14:12.900
(both) So is Cleo,
but she doesn't care.

14:13.030 --> 14:14.990
Uh, okay.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.030
I'll go over them again quickly.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.250
First rule: Enemies never talk
to each other.

14:20.370 --> 14:23.160
Second rule:
It ends on the last day...

14:23.290 --> 14:25.660
- of school break.
- But I don't agree.

14:25.790 --> 14:29.660
We should form a committee to
look at each rule individually!

14:29.800 --> 14:32.750
If you don't agree,
just vote against it.

14:32.890 --> 14:35.210
We need two sides anyway,
eh Luke?

14:35.350 --> 14:38.220
- What a waste of time!
- Yeah, I mean, Chuck is right.

14:38.350 --> 14:40.920
- I guess.
- Okay, okay!

14:41.060 --> 14:43.390
- Everyone move back.
- What now?

14:43.520 --> 14:44.850
Hey!

14:44.980 --> 14:46.970
- You too. Move back.
- Uh! Uh!

14:50.320 --> 14:54.320
Okay! Everyone on this side
of the line is with Luke.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.940
Everyone else
is against him.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.700
(both) Huh? Ah!

15:07.960 --> 15:11.000
(giggling)

15:11.130 --> 15:13.620
Hmm...

15:13.760 --> 15:16.080
Seven against two?

15:16.220 --> 15:17.960
That's not fair!

15:18.100 --> 15:20.970
Yeah, he's right.
Maybe we need to...

15:21.100 --> 15:23.770
Sure it's fair.
They got Mr. Genius.

15:23.890 --> 15:27.480
- He may have a point.
- I got an idea!

15:27.610 --> 15:29.430
- You guys build Frankie's fort...
- (barking)

15:29.570 --> 15:30.940
and we'll attack it.

15:31.070 --> 15:33.140
Then, on the last day
of school break,

15:33.280 --> 15:35.980
whichever army
has the fort, wins.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.120
And this will be
our headquarters!

15:39.240 --> 15:43.320
No way. We all hang out here.
The barn's everybody's place.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.950
What's with you guys?

15:45.080 --> 15:47.210
You make up a bunch of rules
and don't tell us.

15:47.330 --> 15:50.210
You decide the teams.
You throw us out of the barn.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.380
If that's how it's gonna be,
I'm not playing.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.380
Fight with yourself, general!

15:55.510 --> 15:57.590
- (rattling sound)
- Ha!

15:57.720 --> 16:00.840
(moaning in effort) Cleo, come.

16:00.970 --> 16:02.970
(barking)

16:03.100 --> 16:04.890
Now.

16:05.020 --> 16:07.470
- (Cleo whimpering)
- Hey.

16:07.610 --> 16:10.970
Come on, guys. I'm sure we
could figure something out.

16:11.110 --> 16:14.110
Take another vote?
Rewrite the rules?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.310
You can have the barn!

16:18.780 --> 16:23.110
- So much for that.
- Can't have a war without enemies.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.330
- Manolo, wait up.
- (twins) Wanna go bowling or curling?

16:26.460 --> 16:30.920
- I thought today would be fun.
- Hey, where are you guys going?

16:31.050 --> 16:33.040
You could've been a great general.

16:33.170 --> 16:36.130
- I don't know about that.
- That's what I'm saying.

16:36.260 --> 16:40.890
You could've been a great general.
Instead you're a terrible one!

16:41.010 --> 16:43.720
You gotta make
'em wanna fight!

16:43.850 --> 16:47.020
Make them want to fight?
Nobody wants to fight.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.220
Sure they do! It's fun!

16:49.360 --> 16:53.060
You gotta trash-talk 'em.
Make their blood boil.

16:53.190 --> 16:55.020
Right!

16:55.150 --> 17:00.610
Like, ''Ooh! little boy's afraid of
getting snow down his neck.''

17:00.740 --> 17:02.480
Exactly!

17:02.620 --> 17:06.200
''You call that a snowball?
Looks more like a cotton ball!''

17:06.329 --> 17:09.040
''Who taught you
how to throw? Cleo?''

17:09.170 --> 17:11.839
Yeah! That's the idea.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.800
(primitive warrior yells)

17:18.050 --> 17:19.920
(moaning and coughing)

17:22.970 --> 17:25.260
(moaning in effort)
What are you waiting for?!

17:25.390 --> 17:28.430
Oh! Oh right! Whoa!

17:28.560 --> 17:31.600
Hey guys! Come back!

17:31.730 --> 17:34.600
- We got a plan!
- (moaning)

17:48.460 --> 17:50.700
Back up, back up.

17:50.830 --> 17:54.250
- Stop, stop. Stop.
- That's a good dog.

17:54.380 --> 17:57.250
- Target acquired.
- Pass me the binocs.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.300
- They're limited edition.
- He'll just look through 'em.

18:00.430 --> 18:03.760
Not use 'em as
a hockey puck. Huh?

18:05.430 --> 18:07.470
You know, we could
still build a fort.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.060
Give it a rest, Frankie.

18:09.180 --> 18:12.680
- I designed an even better one.
- Do you ever sleep?

18:12.810 --> 18:15.100
Okay everyone.

18:15.230 --> 18:18.150
- Positions for Operation Topsy Turvy!
- Yeah.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.730
Remember, first we
egg them on with Cleo.

18:20.860 --> 18:23.950
- Then wham! Topsy-Turvy!
- (loudly) Topsy...

18:24.070 --> 18:25.650
(all) Shh!

18:25.780 --> 18:27.530
Turvy.

18:27.660 --> 18:29.040
Now!

18:29.160 --> 18:31.620
(moaning)

18:31.750 --> 18:34.540
Oh... Huh?

18:36.050 --> 18:39.750
- Uh...
- You actually eat this stuff?!

18:39.880 --> 18:42.590
- Yuck.
- It's Cleo's.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.130
- (bells tinkling as door opens)
- Oh! Poor dog.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.300
What a cute dog.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.270
You're a real cutie, aren't you?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.600
Yes you are.
What's her name?

18:52.730 --> 18:55.930
- Cleo.
- Piers is in love with her.

18:56.070 --> 18:57.440
- So?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.440
- (short laugh)
- I can see why.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.190
She's very lovable. I'm Sophie.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.820
- Piers. And this is Frankie.
- Call me ''Four-Eyes''.

19:05.950 --> 19:08.360
- You call yourself ''Four-Eyes''?

19:08.490 --> 19:12.080
Look at these things.
I gotta own it, baby!

19:12.210 --> 19:14.660
- He's a genius.
- Really?

19:14.790 --> 19:17.370
I designed a fort.
Let me show you.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.250
- (sighing)
- It's pretty amazing, really.

19:20.380 --> 19:23.050
The generator supplies the tower
here, the draw bridge there

19:23.180 --> 19:25.580
and all the machinery
here, here and there.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.340
Wow, that's actually
a real fort!

19:28.470 --> 19:30.100
What did you think I said?

19:30.220 --> 19:32.380
I know, but I expected...

19:33.890 --> 19:35.600
Sweet.

19:35.730 --> 19:38.400
- Frankie always thinks up something.
- Correct!

19:38.520 --> 19:42.140
And you're always thinking up
something too, aren't you, Cleo?

19:42.280 --> 19:45.560
- Usually ways to get food!
- (squeaky toy squeaking)

19:47.830 --> 19:50.450
- (Cleo whimpering)
- Cleo, no.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.780
- (Cleo howling and barking)
- Aah! Cleo!

19:53.910 --> 19:56.240
Whoa! Oh!

20:01.460 --> 20:04.380
- (Cleo catching her breath)
- Thanks.

20:04.510 --> 20:07.380
- Ooh! Hi wussies!
- Give it up, guys.

20:07.510 --> 20:10.220
You're not gonna get us
to have a snowball fight.

20:10.350 --> 20:12.890
- Hey Cleo!
- (Cleo barking and toy squeaking)

20:13.020 --> 20:14.510
- (giggling)
- Fet--

20:19.820 --> 20:21.970
- Uh...
- What are you waiting for?!

20:22.110 --> 20:23.480
Go on!

20:23.610 --> 20:26.650
Uh... Fetch!

20:26.780 --> 20:28.520
Huh?

20:30.740 --> 20:33.200
- (barking)
- Cleo, stop!

20:33.330 --> 20:37.110
- No! Cleo!
- (barking)

20:37.250 --> 20:39.240
- Whoaaa!
- (gasping)

20:41.800 --> 20:44.040
- Whoaaaa!
- (barking)

20:44.170 --> 20:47.870
- Whoaaa!
- (all) Home run!

20:49.550 --> 20:53.090
- (in slow motion) Whoaaaa!

20:53.220 --> 20:54.680
(dog barking in slow motion)

20:54.810 --> 20:58.760
- (in slow motion) Cleo!
- (in slow motion) No!

21:00.810 --> 21:02.440
Whoa!

21:02.570 --> 21:04.940
- Uh!
- Aah!

21:09.410 --> 21:10.980
Aw, gross!

21:11.120 --> 21:14.370
- Slobber all over him, girl!
- Major fail!

21:14.500 --> 21:16.530
We're not gonna fight you!

21:16.660 --> 21:19.750
Yeah, even with the best
fort ever designed!

21:19.920 --> 21:22.700
Vanguard. Advance!

21:22.800 --> 21:25.080
Uh-oh. We're about
to get clobbered.

21:25.210 --> 21:28.250
We, who are about to get
clobbered, salute you.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.290
(happy bugle melody)

21:30.430 --> 21:32.720
- Huh?
- Open fire!

21:36.930 --> 21:38.510
(both) Nya nya!

21:38.640 --> 21:41.510
- Missed.
- (gasping)

21:41.650 --> 21:43.970
(screaming)

21:44.110 --> 21:46.100
Oh...

21:48.240 --> 21:49.610
(grunting)

21:49.740 --> 21:52.860
- Uh-oh!
- Oh-uh.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.030
(charging yell)

21:58.410 --> 22:02.000
- Yuck! My new vest!
- She creamed us!

22:02.130 --> 22:05.540
You want a fight?
You got one, buddy.

22:05.670 --> 22:07.500
(both) What's with ya?

22:07.630 --> 22:10.720
Battle starts tomorrow
at oh nine hundred hours!

22:10.840 --> 22:14.590
- (cheering)
- Don't forget to bring your toy tuba!

22:14.720 --> 22:16.100
It's a bugle!

22:16.220 --> 22:18.380
And it's not a toy!

22:18.520 --> 22:21.220
- (Cleo groaning)
- I hope you're happy.

22:21.350 --> 22:24.270
Ready to build your
mega-ginormous fort?

22:24.400 --> 22:27.680
I've never been
more ready!

Frankie, you don't
just have four eyes:

23:20.540 --> 23:22.860
You've got vision!

23:23.000 --> 23:24.870
(echo effect)

23:25.000 --> 23:26.740
(laughing)

23:26.880 --> 23:29.120
This is so perfect.

23:29.260 --> 23:31.960
So beautiful.

23:32.090 --> 23:34.840
- You're a mad genius, Frankie.
- (barking)

23:34.970 --> 23:38.420
Now... just imagine it

23:38.560 --> 23:41.920
splattered with the shattered
hopes of our enemy.

23:42.060 --> 23:44.850
Magnificent!

23:44.980 --> 23:47.300
Enemy? What enemy?

23:47.440 --> 23:50.440
Hello Nicky.
Earth to Nicky.

23:50.570 --> 23:53.770
Luke and his gang.
We're going to war!

23:53.900 --> 23:55.320
You didn't think we built this

23:55.450 --> 23:57.690
to protect princesses
from dragons...

23:57.830 --> 23:59.820
- It is a castle.
- (barking)

23:59.950 --> 24:01.740
It's a fort.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.740
Luke and his army
are going to attack.

24:03.870 --> 24:07.570
- And lose.
- (both laughing and dog barking)

24:07.710 --> 24:09.950
War is not fun.

24:10.090 --> 24:13.040
Since when is war not fun?

24:13.170 --> 24:15.300
War is the <i>most</i> fun!

24:15.430 --> 24:18.000
(sighing)

24:18.140 --> 24:21.510
That's peace-lovin'
Nicky for ya.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.100
This is way better
than our new house!

24:24.230 --> 24:27.640
- (dog barking)
- Cleo, come. Now.

24:29.150 --> 24:31.020
Cleo...

24:31.150 --> 24:33.560
I'm the queen of the castle!

24:33.690 --> 24:36.730
And you're all dirty rascals!

24:41.910 --> 24:43.290
Wow.

24:43.410 --> 24:47.080
- This is intense.
- I know, right?

24:47.210 --> 24:50.160
Why did they make
the new kid their general?

24:50.290 --> 24:53.000
Because she's totally awesome!

24:53.130 --> 24:55.090
Whose side are you on?

24:55.220 --> 24:57.420
I don't know if you've noticed,

24:57.550 --> 25:00.010
but there's not a lot of girls
in this town.

25:00.140 --> 25:01.680
I noticed!

25:01.810 --> 25:05.890
So to have one in charge...
is pretty awesome.

25:06.020 --> 25:08.850
- Oh, hello general.
- Binocs.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.520
Uh, the fort's pretty big.

25:10.650 --> 25:13.520
You don't really need binoculars.

25:13.650 --> 25:16.020
- Ugh. Come on.
- Hogger.

25:26.870 --> 25:28.870
(soft music)

25:40.590 --> 25:42.500
(gasping)

25:42.640 --> 25:45.050
We could capture her.

25:45.180 --> 25:46.760
Hold her here for ransom.

25:46.890 --> 25:49.260
Here? With me? No.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.310
Uh, I mean, we're not allowed...
after sundown.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.140
Oh, I get it! Forget it, man.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.190
She's too cool for you.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.480
Ha! What are you
even talking about?

26:01.620 --> 26:02.990
Just...

26:03.120 --> 26:05.740
You know, if you ever
get the chance,

26:05.870 --> 26:07.830
don't be weird.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.580
- Play it cool.
- Pfft!

26:11.750 --> 26:15.080
Play it cool,
holding Sophie for ransom?

26:15.210 --> 26:17.290
Holding her alright.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.710
But not for ransom.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.300
(giggling and snorting)

26:23.970 --> 26:26.640
- (animal howling in the distance)
- Luke?

26:26.720 --> 26:29.560
You wanna know boyfriend...
girlfriend stuff?

26:29.690 --> 26:31.590
Me? Him?

26:31.730 --> 26:34.350
No, no. Just stuff.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.850
You know. About him.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.990
His dad died in... in a war.

26:41.110 --> 26:44.070
He never talks about it.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.240
None of us do either.

26:47.750 --> 26:51.200
- Must hurt.
- Yeah.

26:53.460 --> 26:56.080
(soft music)

27:16.940 --> 27:18.930
(sniffling in the rain)

27:23.700 --> 27:25.770
Present arms!

27:25.910 --> 27:28.860
Ready. Aim. Fire.

27:28.990 --> 27:31.070
(gunshots)

27:31.210 --> 27:34.950
- Aim. Fire.
- (gunshots)

27:35.080 --> 27:38.000
Aim. Fire.

27:38.130 --> 27:40.040
(gunshots)

27:40.170 --> 27:42.210
(sad bugle melody)

28:09.790 --> 28:13.700
(all) Rip 'em up! Tear 'em up!
Throw them to their knees!

28:13.830 --> 28:17.370
Fill their pants with icy snow
'til they holler please!

28:17.500 --> 28:19.460
Go ahead and scream a lot!

28:19.590 --> 28:21.410
It'll prove you're little snots!

28:21.550 --> 28:25.050
Lose! Lose! Lose!
Lose! Lose! Lose!

28:25.180 --> 28:29.040
Rip 'em up! Tear 'em up!
Throw them to their knees!

28:29.180 --> 28:31.390
Fill their pants
with icy snow...

28:34.390 --> 28:36.800
Report, soldier.
What do you see?

28:39.520 --> 28:41.180
A big fort, general.

28:42.690 --> 28:45.530
- It's big!
- And fort-like.

28:45.650 --> 28:48.660
They've already got
their own flag.

28:48.780 --> 28:51.950
- It even has a door.
- Huh.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.790
And they left the keys.

28:53.910 --> 28:55.910
- Dummies.
- (both chuckling)

28:56.040 --> 28:58.450
Follow me.

28:58.580 --> 29:00.710
<i>Let's get 'em.</i>

29:00.840 --> 29:03.160
(moaning in effort)

29:04.760 --> 29:07.000
Bed bugs crawling.

29:07.130 --> 29:11.050
Sorry. Reception is bad.
Please repeat.

29:11.180 --> 29:14.180
I said: Bed bugs crawling.

29:14.310 --> 29:16.550
Forget it! Enemy approaching!

29:16.690 --> 29:18.680
That's what I was trying to say!

29:18.810 --> 29:21.730
I'm sure I saw them first.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.980
If you find a wire, don't touch it.

29:25.110 --> 29:27.980
I've seen the
spy master movie too, Fran.

29:28.110 --> 29:32.190
They're falling for the trap!
What doofuses!

29:32.330 --> 29:34.200
- Whoa! Careful.
- How 'bout that one?

29:34.330 --> 29:36.370
- Whoa! Timber!
- (thud)

29:36.500 --> 29:39.450
- (moaning)
- No, it's too small.

29:39.580 --> 29:43.000
- I'm telling you guys, I smell a trap.
- What's wrong?

29:43.130 --> 29:46.580
- Never seen a door before?
- Lucy!

29:46.720 --> 29:50.080
That's no way to
welcome our enemies.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.090
Okay, enough.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.630
(laughing in satisfaction)

29:53.760 --> 29:56.140
Stand back, everyone!

29:56.270 --> 29:58.840
Here comes the battering ram!

29:58.980 --> 30:02.510
(all chanting ''Chuckie! Chuckie!'')

30:02.650 --> 30:04.480
(moaning in pain)

30:07.070 --> 30:08.440
- Oh!
- Fire!

30:08.570 --> 30:10.110
(both) Fire!

30:10.240 --> 30:12.110
(laughing)

30:12.240 --> 30:15.690
- Ow! Hey!
- Hey!

30:15.830 --> 30:17.740
Is that a girl?

30:17.870 --> 30:20.410
It is! Hey! Hello!

30:20.540 --> 30:21.920
Hello!

30:22.040 --> 30:25.210
Too bad you're on the losing team!

30:25.340 --> 30:28.090
Maybe we can hang out
when this is over?

30:28.220 --> 30:30.710
- Okay!
- Bull's-eye!

30:30.840 --> 30:34.050
(moaning)

30:34.180 --> 30:35.560
George! No!

30:35.680 --> 30:39.550
Brother's down! Ah! (moaning)

30:39.690 --> 30:41.930
Hey Sophie!

30:42.060 --> 30:43.560
(laughing)

30:43.690 --> 30:47.390
After this is all over,
I'll teach you to throw!

30:47.530 --> 30:50.230
Chuckie, Chuckie, Chuckie...

30:50.360 --> 30:51.820
(laughing) Oh!

30:51.950 --> 30:54.190
- Yes!
- (honking the horn and laughing)

30:54.330 --> 30:56.280
- To the right!
- This snow packs good!

30:56.410 --> 30:58.240
- (barking)
- Miss me, miss me!

30:58.370 --> 30:59.620
Ah!

30:59.750 --> 31:02.530
Avenge meeeeee!

31:02.670 --> 31:04.990
I will avenge you!

31:05.130 --> 31:06.870
(dog barking)

31:07.000 --> 31:10.950
Ah! Got a critical butt wound!
Whoa-hoa!

31:11.090 --> 31:12.500
(both) Yes!

31:12.640 --> 31:15.640
Yeah! Ha! Huh?

31:15.760 --> 31:18.220
We need more ammo!

31:18.350 --> 31:21.600
- They're running out of snowballs.
- Finish 'em!

31:21.730 --> 31:24.180
Lucy, get cracking
and make snowballs.

31:24.310 --> 31:26.890
(playing a military melody)

31:27.020 --> 31:28.900
- All units advance!
- (dog barking)

31:29.030 --> 31:31.560
(charging yell)

31:31.740 --> 31:34.030
(laughing in satisfaction)

31:36.280 --> 31:38.360
Get up, you lazy bums.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.990
(both) We can't. We're dead.

31:45.130 --> 31:47.410
- (moaning in effort)
Oh!

31:47.540 --> 31:49.870
(charging yell)

31:50.010 --> 31:52.250
This is too fun!

31:52.380 --> 31:56.130
(buzzer sounding off
and bell ringing)

31:57.760 --> 32:00.300
(all talking at the same time)

32:00.430 --> 32:02.260
Hurry Frankie!

32:02.390 --> 32:06.060
- Coming!
- (moaning in effort)

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
All units fully re-armed.

32:14.530 --> 32:17.980
- What?!
- (both) Fire!

32:18.120 --> 32:20.440
- Whoa!
- Oh!

32:20.580 --> 32:22.200
You missed!

32:22.330 --> 32:24.490
Okay troops. Plan B. Ah!

32:24.620 --> 32:27.160
(both) Uh-oh. That's us.

32:27.290 --> 32:29.500
(charging yells)

32:31.010 --> 32:33.500
Uh-oh. Frankie! Lucy!

32:33.630 --> 32:35.380
Piers! Quick!

32:35.510 --> 32:38.460
- Bet they never expected this!
- Fire!

32:38.600 --> 32:41.130
- Ow!
- Now we got 'em!

32:41.270 --> 32:43.510
Snowballs at
2 o'clock, general!

32:43.640 --> 32:46.510
(dog barking and
Luke playing the bugle)

32:46.650 --> 32:49.220
Charge!

32:49.360 --> 32:51.930
Not so loud, general.
We're not deaf.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.560
- (laughing in satisfaction)
- Oh!

32:54.700 --> 32:57.950
- Ta-ta.
- (moaning)

32:58.070 --> 32:59.980
I'm afraid of heights!

33:00.120 --> 33:03.370
- Oh! We're goin' down!
- (barking and screaming)

33:03.500 --> 33:05.570
(moaning)

33:05.710 --> 33:07.200
(siren sounding off)

33:07.330 --> 33:09.740
Battle's over for the day! Yay!

33:09.880 --> 33:12.080
(all screaming in joy)

33:14.260 --> 33:18.040
- (moaning in effort)
- Yay!

33:18.180 --> 33:20.340
- Wahoo!
- Are you wounded, general?

33:20.470 --> 33:23.560
Who, me? Not a scratch!

33:23.680 --> 33:26.640
And today's first star is me!

33:26.770 --> 33:28.890
We better get up
bright and early.

33:29.020 --> 33:31.310
Cleo, you're in
the other army.

33:31.440 --> 33:35.220
I'm gonna have to get up super early
and have a balanced breakfast.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.930
Cereal, toast, eggs,

33:38.070 --> 33:40.310
bacon, beans, steak...

33:40.450 --> 33:42.110
Hey Luke! You comin'?

33:42.240 --> 33:45.080
- Yeah.

- Yeah. Thanks.

35:18.710 --> 35:21.290

I smelled the enemy!

35:21.430 --> 35:23.710
- What's he doing here?!
- Hey!

35:23.840 --> 35:26.880
I caught him spying on me.
Trying to get intel.

35:27.010 --> 35:30.880
We should bring him in and torture him.
Find out what he knows!

35:31.020 --> 35:33.940
Nah. He didn't
get anything.

35:34.060 --> 35:36.440
Maybe I got
everything I wanted.

35:36.570 --> 35:39.140
Oh yeah? What did you want?

35:39.280 --> 35:41.520
Just trying to get
a sense of the enemy.

35:41.650 --> 35:44.030
Ugh! I'm gonna
put on my Kung Fu suit.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.200
And we'll get some real answers!

35:46.330 --> 35:49.490
Just forget it. And get inside.
You'll catch a cold.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.080
What? But...

35:51.210 --> 35:53.870
I'm like, totally dressed.

(humming cheerfully)

36:22.860 --> 36:24.940
Oh! Whew!

36:26.450 --> 36:29.620
Spying is a two-way street, losers.

36:31.950 --> 36:34.450
No way we're gonna run out of ammo.

36:34.580 --> 36:37.870
Four-Eyes thinks he's so smart.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.210
- His fort is coming down!
- We'll get 'em this time.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.660
Today's gonna be even
funner than yesterday.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.870
Can't wait to see their faces
when we show up

36:45.010 --> 36:47.000
with all these snowballs.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.260
Oh! They're making... iceballs.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.850
We're all gonna diiiiie!!!

36:59.360 --> 37:03.190
- What are you doing?!
- Great snowballs, eh?

37:03.320 --> 37:04.780
You're dipping
them in water!

37:04.900 --> 37:06.940
- Uh-oh.
- Chuck!

37:07.070 --> 37:09.400
But this way they
hold together better.

37:09.530 --> 37:11.080
Your snowballs fall apart.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.910
But you're turning
them into iceballs.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.200
(both) It's just a war.

37:16.330 --> 37:19.000
There's no reason to hurt anyone.

37:19.130 --> 37:21.080
(sighing)

37:21.210 --> 37:24.330
Come on guys,
it's just a little dip.

37:24.470 --> 37:26.370
Here, look.

37:26.510 --> 37:30.380
(iceball crashing through
several floors)

37:30.510 --> 37:32.720
Uh? Oh...

37:36.810 --> 37:38.600
Are you crazy, Chuck?

37:38.730 --> 37:41.220
I think he dipped
his head in ice water.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.020
I'm sorry. Honest.

37:43.150 --> 37:45.610
Look. Here. No iceballs!

37:45.740 --> 37:48.060
(moaning)

37:48.200 --> 37:50.240
Oh! Finished!

37:50.370 --> 37:52.240
(moaning)

37:52.370 --> 37:54.820
I didn't wanna hurt anybody.

37:54.950 --> 37:56.950
Cross my heart!

37:59.040 --> 38:01.250
- Calm down. Catch your breath.
- (moaning)

38:01.380 --> 38:03.450
Iceballs! They're
making iceballs!!!

38:03.590 --> 38:05.380
- (both) What?!
- You sure?

38:05.510 --> 38:07.910
I saw them with my own eyes!
Billions of them!

38:08.050 --> 38:10.920
- Lucy.
- Well, millions for sure.

38:11.050 --> 38:14.840
- The barn was full of iceballs!
- Are you really sure?

38:14.970 --> 38:16.970
I swear!

38:18.520 --> 38:22.180
Those rotten cowards!
How are we gonna get them back?

38:22.310 --> 38:24.220
Fight fire with fire!

38:24.360 --> 38:26.900
An eye for an eye
and all that stuff.

38:27.030 --> 38:29.780
Yeah! I say we level
the playing field.

38:29.910 --> 38:33.320
Make snowballs out of cement.
Or even harder...

38:33.450 --> 38:34.990
Diamonds!

38:35.120 --> 38:37.740
Hang on! I don't
want to hurt anyone.

38:37.870 --> 38:39.450
That's your first problem.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.740
I don't want to
hurt anyone, either.

38:41.880 --> 38:46.700
But war is a messy,
messy business.

38:48.220 --> 38:49.840
(birds squawking)

38:49.970 --> 38:52.540
I don't know
about this...

38:52.680 --> 38:54.470
Just hold it steady.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.970
- It's messy!
- We're almost done.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.850
You're using
way too much!

39:00.980 --> 39:03.600
It's fine.

39:03.730 --> 39:06.850
(all) Rip 'em up, tear 'em up!
Throw them to their knees!

39:06.980 --> 39:09.520
The cheese has arrived.

39:09.650 --> 39:11.530
- <i>I didn't quite get that.</i>
- Huh?

39:11.660 --> 39:15.020
- Repeat please.
- <i>The cheese has...</i>

39:15.160 --> 39:16.780
arrived!

39:16.910 --> 39:20.200
<i>The cheese has arrived?</i>
<i>Who ordered cheese?</i>

39:21.710 --> 39:23.580
They're coming!

39:23.710 --> 39:27.290
Oh! Ten four. Over and out.

39:27.420 --> 39:29.790
The mouse is in the trap.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.080
- What did she say?
- The cow is on the moon.

39:32.220 --> 39:34.630
The moose is in the caboose!

39:34.760 --> 39:37.800
- See? I told you.
- (chanting in the distance)

39:37.930 --> 39:40.470
- (all) Lose, lose, lose!
- Rip 'em up!

39:40.600 --> 39:43.850
Tear 'em up,
throw them to their knees!

39:43.980 --> 39:47.310
Fill their pants with icy snow
'til they holler please!

39:47.440 --> 39:50.480
Go ahead
and scream a lot...

39:50.610 --> 39:53.320
It'll prove you're... little snots.

39:53.450 --> 39:56.200
Lose... Lose...

39:56.330 --> 39:58.950
Lose... Lose?

39:59.080 --> 40:01.750
(short tinkling sound)

40:01.870 --> 40:03.500
Huh?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.290
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, you didn't hear that.

40:07.420 --> 40:10.420
- (whimpering)
- Shh.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.470
Let's get 'em.

40:13.590 --> 40:15.830
- (all) Rip 'em up!
- Tear 'em up!

40:15.970 --> 40:17.460
Throw them to their knees!

40:17.600 --> 40:21.260
Fill their pants with icy snow
'til they holler please!

40:21.390 --> 40:25.390
Go ahead and scream a lot
It'll prove you're little snots!

40:25.520 --> 40:28.010
- Lose! Lose! Lose!
- (moaning)

40:28.150 --> 40:29.560
Lose! Lose! Lose!

40:29.690 --> 40:32.940
Rip 'em up! Tear 'em up!
Throw them to their knees!

40:33.070 --> 40:35.560
Huh?

40:37.950 --> 40:39.690
Oops. Whoa!

40:41.410 --> 40:43.650
- Who's up there?
- Huh?

40:45.870 --> 40:48.080
- Our ammo!
- Move!

40:48.210 --> 40:51.910
- That's totally not fair!
- (screaming)

40:52.050 --> 40:54.590
- Huh?
- Whoa!

40:54.720 --> 40:58.380
- Huh?
- (laughing victoriously)

40:58.510 --> 41:02.260
- Fire!
- (moaning)

41:02.390 --> 41:04.220
Oh! (moaning)

41:04.350 --> 41:07.640
- It's an ambush!
- A what?

41:07.770 --> 41:11.270
- A trap!
- That'll teach you to make iceballs!

41:11.400 --> 41:14.520
- Retreat!
- No guys. It's all a mistake.

41:14.650 --> 41:16.360
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

41:16.490 --> 41:19.360
- Ooh!
- This is cool!

41:19.490 --> 41:23.030
- No place to hide, suckers!
- Come on! Move!

41:23.160 --> 41:25.530
(laughing victoriously)

41:25.660 --> 41:29.030
- Ah! Oh!
- Should've used more paint!

41:29.170 --> 41:31.240
- (dog whimpering)
- Ow!

41:34.760 --> 41:36.670
(giggling)

41:38.470 --> 41:41.390
- That color looks nice on you.
- You really think so?

41:41.510 --> 41:43.670
Run! Faster!

41:45.730 --> 41:49.060
- Oh!
- (moaning)

41:49.190 --> 41:50.900
Victory is ours!

41:51.020 --> 41:52.980
The bugle is ours!

41:53.110 --> 41:55.400
(all screaming in joy)

41:55.530 --> 41:59.530
- Alright guys, we got 'em!
- Crush it!

41:59.660 --> 42:02.860
(kids cheering
and Cleo barking)

42:02.990 --> 42:05.070
- We're the winners!
- Yeah!

42:05.200 --> 42:07.960
(screaming and laughing)

42:08.080 --> 42:10.120
- Yeah!
- Ah!

42:10.250 --> 42:13.700
- Whoo!
- Ah, Sophie!

42:13.840 --> 42:16.130
- Look at Cleo!
- (gasping)

42:16.260 --> 42:18.000
Oh no!

42:18.130 --> 42:20.010
Aw, it'll wash out.

42:20.140 --> 42:21.960
Probably.

42:22.100 --> 42:25.600
- Maybe.
- Probably? Maybe?

42:25.720 --> 42:29.510
You didn't follow the manufacturer's
instructions for safe use?

42:29.650 --> 42:32.680
- I told you not to use so much.
- What?!

42:32.820 --> 42:34.940
You knew the plan.
You thought it was great.

42:35.070 --> 42:37.020
Yeah, but we're just
dumb little kids.

42:37.150 --> 42:40.400
You're the big sister. You're supposed
to keep us out of trouble.

42:40.530 --> 42:43.980
I've had it. Come on Lucy.
We're leaving.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.740
You're not the boss
of me, big sister!

42:46.870 --> 42:48.740
Fine. Be that way.

42:48.870 --> 42:51.110
Find yourselves
another babysitter.

42:51.250 --> 42:53.290
- Argh!
- (dog barking)

42:56.260 --> 42:59.340
(owl hooting in the distance)

42:59.380 --> 43:01.090
Hey...

43:01.220 --> 43:04.840
''l was... wondering if you
could give me my bugle back.

43:06.350 --> 43:09.600
We're having fun and all,
playing war,

43:09.730 --> 43:11.600
but it belonged to my...''

43:11.730 --> 43:13.770
No, no.

43:15.270 --> 43:18.230
I know. ''This is war.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.310
And that means knowing when
you're outta your league.''

43:21.450 --> 43:25.440
''Out of my league? You haven't
won a single battle.''

43:25.580 --> 43:28.070
''Oh, don't get smart with me!''
''Yeah?

43:28.200 --> 43:30.360
Whatcha gonna do about it?''
(grunting)

43:32.630 --> 43:35.120
- (footsteps approaching)
- Ah!

43:35.250 --> 43:38.590
- (moaning in frustration)
- Ha!

43:38.710 --> 43:40.870
I'm sure I heard something!

43:41.010 --> 43:44.130
Probably cockroaches!

43:44.260 --> 43:45.970
Hm!

43:47.470 --> 43:50.720
(train whistle blowing
in the distance)

44:05.870 --> 44:08.570
(soft music)

44:13.710 --> 44:17.660
- (birds squawking)
- Hot chocolate's ready.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.800
It's so nice and peaceful.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.330
The fighting
couldn't last anyway.

44:23.470 --> 44:25.510
We're just too strong.

44:25.640 --> 44:30.010
A day without war
is a victory for peace.

44:30.140 --> 44:32.630
You know, that is so...

44:32.770 --> 44:35.440
so... boring!

44:35.560 --> 44:38.430
Everybody smile!

44:38.690 --> 44:42.610
- Who's that?
- That's my cousin.

44:42.740 --> 44:45.650
Hello. My name is Daniel
Blanshire from Victoriaville.

44:45.780 --> 44:48.530
- Reporter in training.
- <i>Surrender!</i>

44:48.660 --> 44:51.780
- (gasping in surprise)
- I thought you guys won.

44:51.910 --> 44:53.540
- <i>We know you're there!</i>
- Me too!

44:53.660 --> 44:56.870
And I thought this was
going to be boring day!

44:57.000 --> 44:59.370
Yippee! Action shots!

44:59.500 --> 45:01.290
Oh...

45:01.420 --> 45:04.510
<i>Surrender, weasels!</i>

45:04.630 --> 45:07.010
- Where'd you get the megaphone?
- (giggling)

45:07.140 --> 45:11.300
<i>It's my uncle's!</i>
<i>Real expensive.</i>

45:11.430 --> 45:13.140
No fooling around.

45:13.270 --> 45:15.390
<i>Battalions 2 and 3,</i>
<i>take up your positions!</i>

45:15.520 --> 45:19.300
<i>George, Henry, Chuck, Manolo,</i>
<i>arm the catapults.</i>

45:19.440 --> 45:22.890
Yippee! It is on!

45:23.030 --> 45:24.850
We've gotta call the others.

45:24.990 --> 45:27.400
We're gonna crush your little faces!

45:27.530 --> 45:29.820
<i>ln your dreams!</i>

45:29.950 --> 45:31.610
<i>Fire!</i>

45:31.740 --> 45:34.450
- Hey up!
- Ugh!

45:37.330 --> 45:40.920
Ha! You'll have to
do better than that!

45:41.050 --> 45:43.450
(moaning in effort)

45:45.300 --> 45:48.250
Peace talks failed.
Hostilities have resumed.

45:48.390 --> 45:50.210
Get over here.
We need back up.

45:50.350 --> 45:52.720
- You're missing all the fun!
- Huh?

45:54.520 --> 45:57.140
On my way!

45:58.650 --> 46:01.430
Oh! Whatcha waiting for, Cleo?

46:01.570 --> 46:03.890
- Let's go.
- (barking in agreement)

46:04.030 --> 46:06.600
<i>Second wave! Fire at will!</i>

46:08.110 --> 46:12.440
- What did he say?
- He said: Give it all ya got!

46:12.580 --> 46:14.820
Why can't he talk normal,
like regular people?

46:14.950 --> 46:18.070
I know! He's so weird, right?

46:18.210 --> 46:21.290
- Don't chit-chat with the enemy.
- She started it.

46:21.420 --> 46:23.660
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did.

46:23.800 --> 46:26.580
- You're the one who said he's weird!
- I did not.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.540
Will you guys just fire?

46:28.680 --> 46:30.880
At each other, please?

46:31.010 --> 46:33.170
Yeah. Bring it on!

46:36.310 --> 46:39.140
You'll never get me alive, suckers!

46:39.270 --> 46:41.100
Who said anything about alive?

46:41.230 --> 46:44.020
- I'm outta here.
- <i>Have you had enough?</i>

46:45.530 --> 46:47.820
Oh! Is that all you got?

46:47.950 --> 46:49.690
<i>Cease fire!</i>

46:49.820 --> 46:52.940
- (all) Cease fire.
- Hmm!

46:53.160 --> 46:55.200
(whistling cheerfully)

46:55.240 --> 46:57.150
Hey Nicky, hurry up.

46:57.290 --> 47:00.950
(whistling two notes, stopping,
and whistling again)

47:04.170 --> 47:06.710
(still whistling)

47:09.090 --> 47:11.080
Tell us when we can go.

47:11.220 --> 47:14.420
- (whistling)
- Yep. Good to go.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.930
Let 'er rip!

47:17.060 --> 47:19.100
(charging yell)

47:21.310 --> 47:24.850
Battalions 2 and 3,
take up position on the flanks!

47:24.980 --> 47:27.060
- On the where?
- Huh?

47:27.190 --> 47:30.780
- On the... The- there!
- Flanks, flanks, flank.

47:30.900 --> 47:33.440
What the heck are flanks?

47:33.570 --> 47:36.660
(moaning in effort)
It's not working.

47:36.790 --> 47:38.530
Something's wrong.

47:38.660 --> 47:41.700
You guys better back off

47:41.830 --> 47:45.040
or we're gonna get really mad!

47:45.880 --> 47:49.250
<i>Don't listen to her, Jack.</i>
<i>She's already mad. Just keep climbing.</i>

47:49.380 --> 47:50.960
Mayday!

47:51.090 --> 47:53.630
<i>Anybody, please!</i>

47:53.760 --> 47:57.380
- (moaning in effort)
- You can do this, Jack.

47:57.510 --> 48:02.180
- Whoa!
- Look out below!

48:02.310 --> 48:04.390
(screaming)

48:04.520 --> 48:07.860
- Are you crazy?!
- get out of the way!

48:07.980 --> 48:09.940
Attack!

48:10.070 --> 48:12.990
- (one after the other) Sorry.
- Ow!

48:14.490 --> 48:17.410
Sophie, they're destroying
us! Get over here!

48:17.530 --> 48:20.370
It's a massacre! Come! Please!

48:20.500 --> 48:22.450
Sophie, out.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.660
Ugh! I knew you were
a bathroom hogger,

48:24.790 --> 48:28.040
but I never figured
you for a traitor!

48:28.170 --> 48:30.040
Strategic retreat!

48:30.170 --> 48:33.040
What? Never retreat!
Never surrendeeeer!

48:33.180 --> 48:36.010
- They're escaping! Catch them!
- Charge...

48:36.140 --> 48:38.630
(moaning)

48:38.760 --> 48:41.090
(growling)

48:41.230 --> 48:44.430
- (banging at the door)
- No way am I giving up!

48:44.560 --> 48:47.270
I'll fight them from the highest
tower to the deepest dungeon!

48:47.400 --> 48:50.320
I will never surrender!
Never! I...

48:50.440 --> 48:53.860
Ooh! An escape pod!

48:53.990 --> 48:57.270
Bail ouuuuuut!

48:57.410 --> 48:59.730
(moaning in effort)

48:59.870 --> 49:02.790
Ha-ha! Oh! (groaning)

49:02.910 --> 49:05.400
(screaming)

49:08.250 --> 49:11.620
- Go see where this comes out, soldier.
- Yes sir, general sir. Oh!

49:11.760 --> 49:14.710
- Aaah!
- Wahoo!

49:18.640 --> 49:21.130
(screaming in fear)

49:22.810 --> 49:26.140
- Aaah!
- Wahoo!

49:26.270 --> 49:28.980
That girl's out of her gourd.
First the paint.

49:29.110 --> 49:31.640
Then she drops
a giant block of snow on me.

49:31.780 --> 49:34.310
And the yelling. What's next?

49:34.450 --> 49:37.320
(laughing)

49:37.450 --> 49:39.190
Huh?

49:39.330 --> 49:42.780
(muffled screaming)

49:42.910 --> 49:44.870
- Wahoo!
- Aaah!

49:46.370 --> 49:48.860
(muffled moans)

49:49.000 --> 49:51.540
(gasping)

49:53.300 --> 49:54.920
(both screaming)

49:55.050 --> 49:57.540
(moaning)

49:57.680 --> 49:59.670
- Ooh!
- Yah! Yah!

50:01.310 --> 50:03.880
What happened?

50:05.390 --> 50:07.970
They abandoned the fort!
Whoo-hoo!

50:08.100 --> 50:10.590
- The fort is ours!
- (all screaming for joy)

50:14.690 --> 50:17.450
I'll be fine.
Thanks for asking.

It's Daniel Victor from Blanshireville.

52:08.640 --> 52:10.430
(short laugh)

52:11.980 --> 52:14.270
(moaning in effort)

52:16.190 --> 52:19.360
I just can't believe
your sister didn't show up.

52:19.490 --> 52:21.360
They say she's my big sister,

52:21.490 --> 52:24.240
but I'm pretty sure there was
a mix-up at the hospital.

52:24.370 --> 52:26.190
I <i>feel</i> older.

52:26.330 --> 52:28.610
Yeah, a real disappointment.

52:28.740 --> 52:31.580
- She's a quitter.
- And you should see her room.

52:31.710 --> 52:34.830
- A pigsty. Good night.
- Good night.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.200
Good night.

52:42.010 --> 52:43.830
(moaning in effort)

52:43.970 --> 52:46.460
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.470
Thought you'd like to know

52:48.600 --> 52:50.970
a different flag flies
over the fort tonight.

52:51.100 --> 52:55.480
It's a stinky boy flag,
with holes in the butt.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.680
(mimicking) ''Holes in the butt.''

53:03.900 --> 53:06.030
(soft suspense music)

53:15.870 --> 53:17.330
(electronic sound)

53:20.500 --> 53:22.500
(moaning in effort)

53:34.810 --> 53:37.380
Underwear? Yuck!

53:37.520 --> 53:40.010
(suspense music)

53:49.830 --> 53:52.780
(catching her breath
and then gasping)

53:52.910 --> 53:54.410
Goin' somewhere?

53:54.540 --> 53:57.460
We knew you'd come back.

53:57.580 --> 53:59.960
The war's supposed to
stop at night, you know.

54:00.090 --> 54:02.160
- Get her!
- Yes, get her!

54:02.300 --> 54:03.670
(both) Huh? Who?

54:03.800 --> 54:06.120
- Her!
- (moaning)

54:07.720 --> 54:10.040
- Get her!
- Don't let her get away!

54:12.310 --> 54:13.680
(both) Huh?

54:13.810 --> 54:15.800
(catching her breath)

54:18.850 --> 54:22.390
- The emergency exit!
- On my way, general!

54:24.150 --> 54:27.110
(screaming)

54:27.240 --> 54:29.360
Ta, ta!

54:29.490 --> 54:31.900
Whoaaaa!

54:33.740 --> 54:35.870
Ah man!

54:36.000 --> 54:37.790
After her!

54:37.920 --> 54:40.200
(moaning)

54:40.330 --> 54:43.120
(both) Whoaaaa!

54:43.250 --> 54:45.750
Oh man, I can't believe it.

54:45.880 --> 54:49.050
(screaming)

54:52.100 --> 54:53.840
(muffled screaming)

54:53.970 --> 54:55.680
(screaming)

54:55.810 --> 54:58.180
(moaning)

55:01.230 --> 55:03.640
(screaming)

55:03.770 --> 55:06.810
Ha! Missed me!

55:06.940 --> 55:09.520
Crush me once, shame on you!

55:09.660 --> 55:12.060
- (screaming)
- Crush me twice, shame on...

55:12.200 --> 55:14.030
Jack! What're you doing?

55:14.160 --> 55:15.780
Flying, sir.

55:17.290 --> 55:18.870
Oh!

55:20.460 --> 55:22.700
(both screaming)

55:22.840 --> 55:26.040
(both moaning in slow motion
and falling with a thud)

55:27.550 --> 55:29.040
Yaaaay!

55:29.170 --> 55:31.460
Whoo! Ha-ha!

55:32.970 --> 55:35.050
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!

55:35.180 --> 55:37.170
(dog whimpering)

55:38.680 --> 55:41.180
(sighing and gasping)

55:41.310 --> 55:44.150
(humming a victorious melody)

55:47.400 --> 55:49.280
(laughing victoriously)

55:49.400 --> 55:51.110
The enemy flag?!

55:51.240 --> 55:53.230
- Wanna sniff?
- Yuck!

55:53.370 --> 55:56.320
- Ha-ha!
- How'd you do it?!

55:56.450 --> 55:57.950
Not me.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.610
My super-duper fantastic sister!

56:03.250 --> 56:07.300
- Ah! Sophie!
- (soft guitar music)

56:13.050 --> 56:14.430
(giggling)

56:14.550 --> 56:16.930
Not bad for a quitter,
huh, kiddos?

56:17.060 --> 56:19.890
Yeah, well...
about that.

56:20.020 --> 56:22.890
- I, uh...
- No, you were right.

56:23.020 --> 56:26.350
But then I started thinking,
what kind of a leader quits

56:26.480 --> 56:29.020
at the first sign of
dissention among the troops?

56:29.150 --> 56:31.520
- You.
- Yes.

56:31.650 --> 56:35.270
- Well...
- Hey! It's great to have you back!

56:35.410 --> 56:37.780
- (barking in agreement)
- (all) Hoo-ah!

56:41.620 --> 56:43.700
Ah, I knew it!

56:45.210 --> 56:48.460
I shouldn't have let Chuck
get his greasy paws on these.

56:53.050 --> 56:56.220
Oh, all quiet
on the Eastern front!

56:56.350 --> 56:58.750
Same here!

56:58.890 --> 57:02.060
Quiet here too. Nothing to report.

57:02.180 --> 57:04.340
Other than extreme boredom.

57:04.480 --> 57:07.350
(sleepily)
Nothing to report, general.

57:07.480 --> 57:10.350
(moaning)

57:10.480 --> 57:12.520
(sighing) Great.

57:14.740 --> 57:17.910
I've had it with guarding the
flanks. It's like guarding air.

57:18.030 --> 57:20.820
If real war is like this,
I'm not going.

57:20.950 --> 57:22.910
It's a real snoozer.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.660
(soft guitar music)

57:27.590 --> 57:29.080
(moaning softly)

57:31.260 --> 57:33.130
(wings flapping)

57:33.260 --> 57:35.800
(fighting yells)

57:37.720 --> 57:39.550
(sighing)

57:41.060 --> 57:43.010
(slurping)

57:43.140 --> 57:44.850
(dog yawning)

57:44.980 --> 57:47.350
Sitting around
doing nothing...

57:49.360 --> 57:53.940
feels like I'm destroying
all my precious brain cells.

57:54.070 --> 57:56.190
Didn't you tell me

57:56.320 --> 57:59.440
brain cells start dying
the day you're born?

57:59.580 --> 58:01.480
Or even before?

58:01.620 --> 58:03.110
Ah...

58:07.500 --> 58:10.250
(soft music)

58:28.600 --> 58:31.140
- (gasping)
- What's that?

58:31.270 --> 58:34.390
- Nothing.
- (background chatter)

58:34.530 --> 58:38.150
Uh... okay.

58:38.280 --> 58:40.690
(thud and running footsteps)

58:42.200 --> 58:43.700
(taking a deep breath)

58:47.670 --> 58:50.420
- I'm fed up with their war.
- Nah, it's fun!

58:50.540 --> 58:54.490
Look at my photos!
It's all here! The human drama.

58:54.630 --> 58:56.340
The gritty realism.

58:56.470 --> 58:58.290
- Watch out!
- Aah!

58:58.430 --> 59:01.210
What's that?

59:03.060 --> 59:04.550
Ah!

59:06.850 --> 59:09.390
That's an idea.

59:09.520 --> 59:13.060
<i>Help! Help!</i>

59:13.190 --> 59:14.730
(gasping)

59:14.860 --> 59:16.900
(suspense music)

59:19.910 --> 59:23.740
Why are you looking at me?
It's not my voice.

59:23.870 --> 59:26.110
That's my megaphone!

59:26.250 --> 59:28.780
Oh! Yeah, it's...

59:28.910 --> 59:32.330
It's... It's hard to remember
where I put everything!

59:32.460 --> 59:34.620
<i>ls anybody listening?</i>

59:34.750 --> 59:37.540
It's Daniel Blanshire
from Drummondville.

59:37.670 --> 59:39.550
Victoriaville.

59:39.680 --> 59:43.510
- There's two Daniel Blanshires?
- Ugh!

59:43.640 --> 59:45.880
<i>Nicky needs help! Hurry!</i>

59:46.020 --> 59:47.920
It's one of
Luke's traps.

59:48.060 --> 59:51.510
No. It's Nicky.
We have to go see.

59:51.650 --> 59:53.720
<i>He's caught in a fox trap!</i>

59:53.860 --> 59:56.690
Uh, bear trap.
It sounds bigger.

59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.230
<i>A bear trap!</i>
<i>It sounds bigger!</i>

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.770
Say I'm dead.

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:04.740
<i>He's...</i>
They'll ever believe that.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.690
Almost dead, then.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.830
I don't think so.
Too sensational.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.700
Ugh!

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:17.080
<i>He's out cold!</i>
<i>And there's blood everywhere!</i>

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.050
It's one of Sophie's traps.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.300
Nicky wouldn't
side with anyone.

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:26.960
- I think we should go.
- <i>Nicky says to bring bandages!</i>

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.010
No. I'm out cold. I can't talk.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.060
<i>He told me that</i>
<i>before going out cold!</i>

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.150
<i>Hurry up! He's getting worse!</i>

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:39.810
<i>His face is blue.</i>
<i>His eyes are bulging.</i>

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:43.530
Nobody's coming. You sure
they're your friends?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.570
- Hurry up, you guys.
- Nicky's the peace guy, right?

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.570
- Who'd step in a trap.
- Hey, keep up, Frankie!

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.250
I'm the one wearing glasses.

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.160
- Look, there he is!
- What a waste of time!

01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.280
Who'd step on a bear trap?

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.580
- I hope he's okay.
- This better be real.

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.340
- Ah!
- Don't push.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.870
We should've brought a sled.

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:05.170
(bird squawking in the distance)

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.010
Where's the blood?

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.020
- I don't see any blood.
- Argh!

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:16.600
(Nicky moaning
and friends gasping)

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.810
- Wait.
- (still moaning)

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.060
Aren't you supposed
to be unconscious?

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:23.680
(Nicky gasping
and others reacting)

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.740
- We're leaving.
- So are we.

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:29.110
- (background reactions)
- Wait!

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.400
Now that you're united
by a common cause,

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.990
- you gotta make peace.
- (all) Huh?!

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.330
- No way!
- Never!

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.870
Nicky's right. War is boring.
I'm done fighting.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.210
I'm done too.
Smell ya later, dweebs.

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.960
(both) I'm tired of guard duty.
There's nothing to guard but... him.

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:50.460
- It was fun while it lasted.
- Guys! Guys, come on!

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.510
Come on, Daniel!
We stopped the war!

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.890
- Interesting turn of events.
- We should take a group picture.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.100
(background chatter)

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:01.180
There goes your
army, general.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.480
Yours too.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:06.230
They sure liked
attacking forts.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.120
Hmm.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.700
Give me the fort back and they
can have one last attack.

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:14.400
There's still another
day of winter break.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.780
Why would I agree to that?

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.240
Your army might
come back.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.160
Besides, if you don't,
you'll never know

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.540
if you could have taken the fort
with me defending it.

01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:36.430
(soft music)

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.640
(bird squawking in the distance)

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:43.070
You have a...
bit of snow there.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:46.940
You've got a hole
in your mitten.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.620
Well... that was...

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.750
(uneasy laugh) Um...

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.720
Oh, uh, well,

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.880
you're not much of
a kisser either.

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:13.590
I was gonna say ''nice''.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.720
But I am a better
kisser than you.

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:20.270
Uh... well, I'll see you
on the battlefield!

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.730
Good luck with that, general!

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.100
Yeah! You bet, soldier!

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.230
(soft music)

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.740
(moaning in frustration)

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:40.040
(wind blowing)

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.580
I can't let you
play today, Cleo.

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:48.290
It's the final battle.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.710
Who knows what tricks
they'll have up their sleeves.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.330
And I don't want you getting
covered in paint again.

01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:55.510
(dog whimpering)

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.970
It's because I love you, Cleo.

01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:03.310
(growling softly)

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.190
I don't know how you got Luke
to give us the fort back.

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:10.400
I don't really know either.

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:12.690
He just offered it.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.240
- Curious military strategy.
- (electronic alert)

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:19.900
- (kids chanting)
- Enemy approaching. 12 o'clock.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.660
- Enemy at 12 o'clock!
- Roger that!

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:25.370
(all) Lose! Lose! Lose!

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.290
Confirmed! Scumbags in sight
at 12 o'clock!

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:31.710
(all) Rip 'em up, tear 'em
up, throw them to their knees!

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.710
Fill their pants with icy snow
'til they holler please!

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:39.550
And at 3 o'clock.
And 9 o'clock.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.720
- Scumbags everywhere!
- What?!

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:45.890
(background chatter
and laughter)

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.860
They've recruited
the first graders!

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.730
That's just wrong.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.320
