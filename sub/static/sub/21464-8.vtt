WEBVTT

02:24.478 --> 02:25.813
Hey, Ted.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.567
Ready for your big day?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.069
Yeah.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.156
Yeah.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.647
I also completed a new draft

03:09.648 --> 03:11.566
of the Jim Fitzgerald
cross-examination.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.693
The questions are
in the top notebook there.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.486
Please review the changes.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.906
You hold in your hands a blueprint

03:17.907 --> 03:21.117
for the public evisceration
of James R. Fitzgerald--

03:21.118 --> 03:23.913
fruit of the poisonous tree.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.247
If you stick to my questions,

03:26.248 --> 03:28.166
his search warrant
will be invalidated,

03:28.167 --> 03:29.960
and I'll be walking out of here.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.714
Why don't you guys
go and review this?

03:52.524 --> 03:54.360
You don't want to see this.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.070
I want you to know I'm here,

03:57.071 --> 03:58.863
because none of this matters.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.199
He can tear your résumé
apart on that stand.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.244
He can burn forensic linguistics
at the stake.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.163
I will still be here.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.042
Check your left jacket pocket.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.213
You know,
we can't count our chickens

04:15.214 --> 04:16.214
before they hatch.

04:16.215 --> 04:17.298
The search warrant may stand,

04:17.299 --> 04:19.384
and if it does,
we'll be going to trial.

04:19.385 --> 04:22.763
Sure, but I don't expect
that to happen.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.351
Hope for the best,
prepare for the worst.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.561
That's my job.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.149
We've been laying the groundwork
for the next steps here just in case.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.069
It's called a 12.2 motion.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.904
It'll let us introduce evidence
about your past

04:39.905 --> 04:41.698
and how that's impacted you,

04:41.699 --> 04:44.242
some things about
the Murray experiments,

04:44.243 --> 04:45.869
this kind of thing.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.123
If you give your permission.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.459
I know I certainly see you
much differently

04:53.460 --> 04:54.877
now that I've gotten
to know you better,

04:54.878 --> 04:57.298
and I'd like the jury
to see the real you, too.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.759
Sure.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.970
You have my permission.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.222
All rise.

05:49.308 --> 05:52.518
Calling criminal case S96259,

05:52.519 --> 05:55.646
United States versus
Theodore John Kaczynski.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.982
Be seated.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.779
Okay, I've reviewed the defense
motion to suppress evidence.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.364
The court is ready
to hear testimony

06:04.365 --> 06:08.326
from Supervisory Special Agent
James Fitzgerald.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.411
And is the witness present?

06:10.412 --> 06:11.663
Yes, Your Honor.

06:44.530 --> 06:48.909
Let me see counsel
in my chambers before we begin.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.249
Is this about the motion?

06:56.250 --> 06:58.377
We'll get him on the stand, okay?

07:26.488 --> 07:29.657
The court finds the defense's motion
to be without merit.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.325
The search warrant stands.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.369
Testimony from
Special Agent Fitzgerald

07:33.370 --> 07:34.620
will not be necessary.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.164
Jury selection begins Monday.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.207
Your Honor,
motion to reconsider.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.417
Motion denied.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.627
We're moving on.
Adjourned.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.297
All rise.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.050
I'm so sorry.
We did everything we could.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.178
What happened in there, Judy?

07:50.179 --> 07:52.472
He's a law-and-order judge,
freaked out by the publicity

07:52.473 --> 07:54.015
and terrified of losing control.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.101
He called this a fishing expedition.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.977
And we made the case,
we fought for it,

07:57.978 --> 08:00.147
but the search warrant's
gonna stand.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.815
Forensic friggin' linguistics.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.026
I don't know how,
but you did it.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.444
Why'd the motion
get thrown out?

08:06.445 --> 08:07.945
We dodged a bullet. Well done.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.699
This is a big win
for the case and you.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.328
- Agent Fitzgerald?
- Yeah.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.330
Charles Epstein.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.500
I've been coming to every session.

08:20.459 --> 08:21.668
This is good news.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.836
Every session.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.838
And I'll be at every one until it's over.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.508
Until justice is done.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.608
<i>"Until justice is done."</i>

08:46.068 --> 08:47.652
<i>Justice.</i>

08:47.653 --> 08:49.821
<i>Why did they throw out that motion?</i>

08:51.323 --> 08:52.574
<i>What happened in there?</i>

08:53.825 --> 08:55.243
<i>Did they sell you out
behind closed doors</i>

08:55.244 --> 08:56.495
<i>with Judge Burrell?</i>

08:57.412 --> 08:58.330
<i>Why?</i>

08:59.456 --> 09:01.332
<i>Why would Judy Clarke
write this whole motion</i>

09:01.333 --> 09:02.626
<i>and then sabotage it?</i>

09:04.419 --> 09:06.129
<i>What's happening?</i>

09:13.387 --> 09:14.845
This is the defense's motion

09:14.846 --> 09:16.430
to get the search warrant
thrown out.

09:16.431 --> 09:19.183
Look at the language.
The idiolect is an exact match.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.269
Ted wrote this whole thing himself.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.770
Why would a lawyer
let their client

09:22.771 --> 09:25.106
write the most important document
in the entire case?

09:25.107 --> 09:26.358
I don't know.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.987
Doesn't make sense, does it?

09:32.531 --> 09:35.617
Unless it's to distract him
from his lawyers' real plan.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.579
I think they're gonna
try to get him off

09:39.580 --> 09:41.248
with an insanity defense.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.168
I saw one of his victims today,
Epstein.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.504
He shook my hand.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.131
He has 2 1/2 fingers now,

09:50.132 --> 09:52.384
and he'll have 2 1/2 fingers
the rest of his life.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.346
Yet they act as if I won,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.723
that it's over.
It's not over.

09:58.724 --> 10:02.102
It's not over for Epstein
until Ted is behind bars forever,

10:02.561 --> 10:03.686
not in some psych ward

10:03.687 --> 10:05.646
or on his way
to supervised release.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.108
Ted has power over every one of us
as long as he's not in jail.

10:12.571 --> 10:16.782
You know, the first time
you sat with Ted,

10:16.783 --> 10:18.909
I didn't know if you
were gonna come back.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.204
You have all the feelings
that Ted feels:

10:22.205 --> 10:23.372
the anger, the resentment,

10:23.373 --> 10:24.790
the feelings of betrayal,

10:24.791 --> 10:27.376
the feelings like there's something
so wrong with the world.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.339
But you did the one thing
that Ted could never do,

10:31.298 --> 10:32.840
and that was to look
at Charles Epstein

10:32.841 --> 10:34.885
as a fellow human being,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.847
to look at him
with a sense of empathy,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.390
to feel a sense
of obligation to him.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.727
And if that's what
is motivating you now,

10:44.645 --> 10:47.438
I think that's truly noble.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.566
I used to think
that Ted had all the answers.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.612
Ted does have some of the answers.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.782
Not the ones that really matter, though.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.909
See, there's only one thing
not accounted for

10:59.910 --> 11:01.328
in Ted's philosophy.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.707
But it's everything.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.088
It's what you felt
shaking Epstein's hand.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.802
Simple as that, huh?

11:17.803 --> 11:20.263
Since when was love ever simple?

11:23.225 --> 11:26.144
Now go.
You know how to finish this.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.624
Did you come here to gloat?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.334
'Cause I have work to do.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.754
I got something to show you.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.187
- Where are we?
- An Air Force base.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.633
Well, this reeks
of desperation.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.343
I can't even--

13:22.344 --> 13:24.637
What--Is this supposed
to intimidate me?

13:24.638 --> 13:26.263
You'll not only lock me up,

13:26.264 --> 13:27.891
you'll lock my house up as well?

13:28.809 --> 13:32.686
James, here's the thing
you're not grasping.

13:32.687 --> 13:36.065
The outcome of the trial is nothing.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.859
The trial itself is everything.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.362
It's gonna give me the biggest
microphone in the world.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.197
Before, I had to threaten violence

13:43.198 --> 13:45.241
to get one manifesto published
in <i>The Post.</i>

13:45.242 --> 13:46.367
Now I'm gonna be piped

13:46.368 --> 13:48.577
directly into every living room
in the country.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.331
And if you put me in a jail cell,

13:52.123 --> 13:54.251
I will spend the rest of my life
appealing.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.879
But if it's the worst case,

13:58.171 --> 14:03.093
the very worst case a person
like you can possibly imagine,

14:03.718 --> 14:05.136
the death penalty,

14:06.304 --> 14:09.850
I promise you,
I won't even blink.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.564
There's one possibility
you didn't think of.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.233
On the cabin,
the prosecution didn't bring it.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.235
The defense did.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.239
Why?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.741
Why don't you know about it?

14:28.702 --> 14:29.785
<i>Thank you
for having me here.</i>

14:29.786 --> 14:31.078
<i>I appreciate the opportunity</i>

14:31.079 --> 14:35.666
<i>to tell my brother's story
as I understand it.</i>

14:35.667 --> 14:37.751
<i>The real story of Ted Kaczynski</i>

14:37.752 --> 14:42.215
<i>is the story of lifelong,
undiagnosed mental illness.</i>

14:42.507 --> 14:45.092
<i>Some years ago, I showed
his letters to a psychiatrist,</i>

14:45.093 --> 14:47.262
<i>who found him deeply delusional</i>

14:47.888 --> 14:50.681
<i>and provisionally diagnosed him
with schizophrenia.</i>

14:50.682 --> 14:52.808
<i>And the clinical description
of paranoid schizophrenia</i>

14:52.809 --> 14:56.645
<i>mirrors many of the behaviors</i>

14:56.646 --> 14:59.023
<i>that I've observed in Ted
over the years,</i>

14:59.024 --> 15:01.859
<i>especially his break from society
as a young man.</i>

15:01.860 --> 15:04.236
Your brother's on every
news channel, every magazine,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.071
every newspaper,
saying the same thing.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.491
He's got, like, a script
he's repeating over and over.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.870
At least Judas had the decency
to hang himself.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.206
David doesn't even believe
in mental illness.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.791
Who cares?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.877
We'll muzzle him the moment
the trial begins.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.879
He's not the only one repeating
from that script

15:21.880 --> 15:23.881
or talking to the press.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.966
It's <i>The New York Times.</i>

15:25.967 --> 15:29.678
"A sealed psychological report
provided by Kaczynski's lawyers

15:29.679 --> 15:32.556
"suggests that Kaczynski has been
suffering from mental illness

15:32.557 --> 15:34.308
"since before he moved
into a one-room shack

15:34.309 --> 15:36.185
"in the woods in 1972.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.561
"Its findings are consistent

15:37.562 --> 15:40.190
with diagnosis
of paranoid schizophrenia."

15:42.609 --> 15:44.110
They're setting you up.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.904
Your own lawyers
are working against you.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.823
They're the ones
feeding David his lines,

15:49.824 --> 15:51.241
giving this to the press.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.159
And they're the ones

15:52.160 --> 15:55.037
that shipped this cabin
across the country

15:55.038 --> 15:57.331
so they could bring
in the jury and say,

15:57.332 --> 15:59.333
"Look at this pathetic man
and his pathetic cabin.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.960
You got to be crazy
to live like this."

16:00.961 --> 16:01.919
I don't believe it.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.339
They can't do any of that, James.

16:04.965 --> 16:08.926
My legal team isn't authorized
to pursue a mental-defect defense.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.220
Right. Right. You'd have
to give them permission

16:11.221 --> 16:13.347
to file, like, a 12.2 motion,

16:13.348 --> 16:15.266
and you'd never grant it.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.728
Ted...

16:19.854 --> 16:22.272
You can see
so much about the world,

16:22.273 --> 16:24.358
but you've got a big blind spot

16:24.359 --> 16:26.111
when it comes to who
you choose to trust.

16:26.403 --> 16:29.405
You gave your lawyers permission
to bring in experts

16:29.406 --> 16:30.990
to prove that you're mentally defective,

16:30.991 --> 16:33.033
and they're gonna twist
everything you've ever written,

16:33.034 --> 16:34.743
everything you've ever told anybody

16:34.744 --> 16:38.039
to fit the predetermined diagnosis
of paranoid schizophrenia.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.332
But before those experts
come in,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.459
the whole world
is gonna hear their diagnosis

16:42.460 --> 16:44.712
a million times on TV,
in the newspapers,

16:44.713 --> 16:46.296
from David,
from your own mother.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.632
So the trial is just gonna be
a foregone conclusion.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.926
And you think death is the worst
thing that they can do to you?

16:50.927 --> 16:51.969
They won't even give you that,

16:51.970 --> 16:53.513
'cause they don't execute crazies.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.057
I'll get new lawyers.
I'll appeal.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.225
There won't be any appeals.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.977
They'll have your capacity removed.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.021
They're gonna stick you
in an insane asylum

17:02.022 --> 17:05.233
where, slowly,
you will be adjusted.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.403
Pills, electroshock therapy,

17:09.404 --> 17:11.614
threat, punishment, reward,

17:12.198 --> 17:13.991
till finally you're cured.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.037
It might take years,
but it's gonna happen.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.873
You will be normal,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.375
and you'll rejoin society.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.044
You'll get a credit card,
an apartment,

17:25.045 --> 17:26.837
business casual wardrobe,
you know,

17:26.838 --> 17:28.631
some of those tops
with the penguins on them.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.425
And you'll get a job
behind a desk

17:31.426 --> 17:33.010
where you'll work obediently
9:00 to 5:00,

17:33.011 --> 17:34.720
and your first paycheck,
you get a cellphone.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.513
Next one, you get a TV.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.933
You know, if you splurge,
you can get yourself a Nintendo.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.644
And every night, you fall asleep
watching that TV.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.521
And every weekend,
you're gonna go to the mall.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.856
You're gonna walk around Circuit City.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.442
You're gonna look at
the big-screen TVs and think,

17:48.443 --> 17:50.028
"Should I get myself a 20-incher?

17:50.653 --> 17:52.571
Or should I just keep
saving up for the 27-incher?

17:52.572 --> 17:53.697
I don't know."

17:53.698 --> 17:55.157
And as you're
thinking about this,

17:55.158 --> 17:56.408
slurping on
your Orange Julius,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.077
somebody's gonna
recognize you and say,

17:58.078 --> 18:00.788
"Weren't you that Unabomber guy,
you know, the guy

18:00.789 --> 18:02.706
that wrote all that stuff
and killed all those people?"

18:02.707 --> 18:04.208
And you'll go,
"Yeah, that was me,

18:04.209 --> 18:05.751
"but I was very sick.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.338
But I got help, and I'm much,
much better now, thank you."

18:09.756 --> 18:11.508
And then you're gonna go back
to watching your TVs.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.553
And you won't even remember that
you wanted anything more than this.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.432
See, Ted, you predicted all this
in your manifesto.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.770
"Many tame and conformist types
seem to have a powerful need

18:24.771 --> 18:27.523
to depict the enemy of society
as sick

18:27.524 --> 18:29.441
"so as to delegitimize

18:29.442 --> 18:31.736
their valid complaints
against society."

18:33.029 --> 18:36.365
This cabin used to be
a symbol of moral courage,

18:36.366 --> 18:38.075
and now they're
just gonna point to it

18:38.076 --> 18:39.869
and say you've got to be insane
to live this way.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.663
Well, they brought the cabin,

18:42.664 --> 18:44.791
but they didn't bring the forest.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.336
Or the rain.
It was beautiful.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.882
It was very beautiful.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.301
Yeah, I know it was.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.108
You know, the irony is,

19:11.109 --> 19:15.029
they're gonna show this cabin
as evidence that I'm crazy.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.657
But if everyone was content
to live simply like this,

19:18.658 --> 19:21.368
we'd have no more war,

19:21.369 --> 19:24.247
no poverty, no pollution.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.917
The truth is, if someone
could hand me a pill

19:28.918 --> 19:32.505
that would make me normal,
take these questions away,

19:32.755 --> 19:34.382
I might even take it.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.638
If it was my own choice.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.933
Your brother keeps saying
that you'd be happier in a jail cell.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.352
Three hot meals a day, plus...

19:47.103 --> 19:50.230
the dimensions are
about the same, 10 by 12.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.317
Hmm. Well, he would say that,
wouldn't he?

19:53.318 --> 19:56.988
If I go to jail, he pockets
a million-dollar reward.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.866
My lawyers get to say
they saved me from execution.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.160
The judge and the prosecutors
can brag about

20:03.161 --> 20:05.370
how the Unabomber will rot
in a hole forever.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.706
And what do I get?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.210
I know you're not insane.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.795
Every time I stop at a red light

20:13.796 --> 20:16.673
or I follow the arrows in Ikea

20:16.674 --> 20:21.845
or I sit and I wait and listen
for the modem to dial up,

20:21.846 --> 20:24.473
I can see the systems
that control our lives,

20:24.474 --> 20:27.060
and I feel my freedom
being hemmed in, and I hate it.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.188
What you have to say
about the world,

20:30.772 --> 20:32.732
it matters to the future.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.528
And all I gotta do is roll over
and stop fighting, right?

20:39.197 --> 20:40.948
Well, now, isn't that convenient,

20:40.949 --> 20:43.993
the way your own interests and mine
align so perfectly?

20:44.661 --> 20:45.703
No, the fight's fixed.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.331
It's done.
You've already lost.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.793
Get out of my house now, please.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.214
Get out!

20:59.592 --> 21:01.678
You fight this,
they'll call you crazy.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.349
Or you plead guilty
and go away forever.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.769
And your ideas will live on.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.710
Sit down, Judy.

21:34.544 --> 21:35.753
We need to talk.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.675
What did you discuss in chambers

21:41.676 --> 21:44.220
during the challenge
to the search warrant?

21:45.221 --> 21:47.973
I told you. Burrell didn't want
his courtroom to become a circus.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.559
Did you sell me out, Judy?

21:50.560 --> 21:51.769
Did you?

21:52.520 --> 21:54.981
Did you go behind my back
and torpedo that motion?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.274
Burrell called <i>me</i>
into chambers, Ted.

21:57.275 --> 21:58.276
Remember?

21:59.944 --> 22:00.778
Hang on.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.323
Contraband.

22:04.615 --> 22:07.160
Do I have total control
of my defense?

22:07.952 --> 22:09.996
It's your defense.

22:10.371 --> 22:14.041
This is all about you,
every decision, every discussion.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.459
My entire life right now

22:15.460 --> 22:17.336
revolves around
doing right by you, okay?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.588
So you will not be
presenting to the court

22:19.589 --> 22:21.049
that I am mentally defective?

22:21.299 --> 22:22.549
Ted, what gave you that idea?

22:22.550 --> 22:24.593
Fitzgerald showed me
the cabin, Judy.

22:24.594 --> 22:27.429
He showed me the cabin,
and he told me the 12.2 meant

22:27.430 --> 22:28.972
that you were gonna say I'm insane,

22:28.973 --> 22:31.641
and you know that would be
so much worse for me than death.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.643
Ted, we found out
the prosecution

22:33.644 --> 22:35.896
built their own mock-up
of your cabin to show the jury

22:35.897 --> 22:37.314
and that they were planning

22:37.315 --> 22:39.275
to present their own
mental health testimony.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.486
In my legal judgment,
it was prudent to ensure

22:42.487 --> 22:45.906
we'd be able to present the truth
about you and your life

22:45.907 --> 22:48.326
to combat
the government's distortions.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.670
I tried to keep you
out of the trenches on this,

23:00.671 --> 23:02.756
take care of the Ps and Qs

23:02.757 --> 23:06.135
so you can keep thinking
big-picture for us.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.929
But if you lack confidence
in my legal judgment...

23:08.930 --> 23:09.846
- No.
- If you want to read

23:09.847 --> 23:11.264
everything we've filed
on your behalf,

23:11.265 --> 23:12.849
- I'm more than happy to--
- No, I'm not saying that.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.518
No, I'll bring in
the document boxes

23:14.519 --> 23:16.269
if you want
total transparency,

23:16.270 --> 23:18.522
if you want to see
and approve everything

23:18.523 --> 23:19.856
- page by page--
- No.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.989
I trust you. I've just been
betrayed by so many people.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.367
Fitzgerald got into my head.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.621
You know I really care about you.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.457
Not just as a colleague.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.004
Now finish these
before the guards see.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.424
You'll get me into trouble.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.063
The defense has some
remaining questions

24:00.064 --> 24:01.607
regarding juror questionnaires.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.359
A number of the responses
from juror numbers 16,

24:04.360 --> 24:06.027
68, and 73 were illegible,

24:06.028 --> 24:08.281
and we'd like to clarify those
before we move on to voir dire.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.031
Counsel?

24:10.032 --> 24:11.700
We couldn't read them, either,
Your Honor.

24:11.701 --> 24:12.784
We have no objection.

24:12.785 --> 24:13.994
I'll allow it.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.163
Anything else
before we move on?

24:16.164 --> 24:19.082
Yes, Your Honor. We need
some clarification from the defense

24:19.083 --> 24:20.917
before we can begin jury selection.

24:20.918 --> 24:23.920
I have here what I believe to be

24:23.921 --> 24:27.466
an intentionally vague 12.2 motion
from the defense,

24:27.467 --> 24:29.176
but their witness list

24:29.177 --> 24:32.429
includes a number of experts
on paranoid schizophrenia.

24:32.430 --> 24:33.722
Your Honor, can we move this
to chambers?

24:33.723 --> 24:35.474
No, what is he--
What are you talking about?

24:35.475 --> 24:37.976
We need clarification before
beginning jury selection,

24:37.977 --> 24:39.561
Your Honor, if the defense
is going to pursue

24:39.562 --> 24:41.062
a mental-defect defense
and continue to...

24:41.063 --> 24:41.980
- That is not our intention.
- Your Honor, please, can we--

24:41.981 --> 24:44.608
And continue to claim that
the defendant is paranoid--

24:44.609 --> 24:47.152
Your Honor, I need a moment
alone with my attorneys.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.864
You stood right there,
and you lied to my face.

24:51.449 --> 24:52.949
We're saving your life, Ted.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.452
It's my life, Judy!

24:55.536 --> 24:56.871
Mine!

25:00.583 --> 25:02.959
You're gonna walk back in there,

25:02.960 --> 25:04.294
and you're gonna inform the court

25:04.295 --> 25:06.880
that we will not be pursuing
mental-defect defense,

25:06.881 --> 25:08.173
not now, not ever.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.257
I won't have it.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.635
Whether you approve of
my strategic decisions or not,

25:11.636 --> 25:13.803
I have an ethical obligation
in this system

25:13.804 --> 25:15.931
to do what I have to
in order to save your life.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.391
You're not saving my life, Judy!
You're saving my body,

25:18.392 --> 25:21.646
and you're saving my body
by destroying my life's work!

25:23.314 --> 25:25.690
Ted, you mailed bombs
to innocent people

25:25.691 --> 25:28.569
so you could get some half-baked
ideas published in a newspaper.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.405
I will work around the clock
to save your life.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.366
That's my obligation
as your attorney.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.620
But if you're not mentally
defective, I don't know who is.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.292
Your Honor,

25:44.293 --> 25:46.628
my relationship
with my present attorneys

25:46.629 --> 25:48.088
has become untenable.

25:48.089 --> 25:49.673
They have admitted
to lying to me,

25:49.674 --> 25:51.550
to tricking me,
to betraying my trust.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.802
They knew all along
that I would rather die

25:53.803 --> 25:56.888
than be falsely portrayed
as mentally ill.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.683
I do not want
to represent myself,

25:59.684 --> 26:02.144
but right now,
I see no alternative.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.399
I don't think so, Mr. Kaczynski.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.150
In my courtroom,
there are no theatrics,

26:09.151 --> 26:10.860
and there are no delays.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.737
I may be many things,
Mr. Kaczynski,

26:12.738 --> 26:15.825
but the one thing I am not
is a Lance Ito.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.118
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.370
The judge in the O.J. trial.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.080
No delay.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.833
The trial will continue.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.002
Well, Your Honor,
I'm not asking for a delay.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.962
I can begin representing
myself in an hour.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.422
One hour from now.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.881
We've already considered this.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.800
Based on
the psychological evaluation

26:33.801 --> 26:36.178
your defense provided me,

26:36.554 --> 26:40.558
I find you mentally unsound
to mount an effective defense.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.814
Psychological evaluations
that you've already considered?

26:49.358 --> 26:51.526
Did you all discuss this
beforehand?

26:51.527 --> 26:54.571
Have you all decided
how this ends?

26:54.572 --> 26:55.989
I'm sane enough to stand trial,

26:55.990 --> 26:57.616
sane enough to spend
the rest of my life

26:57.617 --> 26:58.825
in a federal penitentiary,

26:58.826 --> 27:01.077
but I'm too insane
to represent myself,

27:01.078 --> 27:02.704
too insane to be executed,

27:02.705 --> 27:05.457
and I'm guessing
I'm too insane to testify

27:05.458 --> 27:07.792
and say anything about
what I actually believe in.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.837
Is that what your
secret psych report said?

27:10.838 --> 27:14.549
Your Honor, I am afraid
I have a constitutional right

27:14.550 --> 27:16.217
to represent myself,

27:16.218 --> 27:18.553
and if I have to take that
to the judicial review board,

27:18.554 --> 27:19.596
I will.

27:19.597 --> 27:20.597
Well, of course
you have that right.

27:20.598 --> 27:23.266
You can certainly choose
to represent yourself.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.477
If you do, however,
that raises the question

27:25.478 --> 27:29.522
of whether you're mentally fit
to stand trial at all.

27:29.523 --> 27:32.359
Now, we can easily
resolve the question

27:32.360 --> 27:33.610
of your mental competency

27:33.611 --> 27:37.697
with an observation period
in a mental institution,

27:37.698 --> 27:41.618
say, starting with a 60-day stay
in the care of a psych hospital,

27:41.619 --> 27:45.538
perhaps longer if the doctors
find it necessary

27:45.539 --> 27:47.791
to start treatment or medication,

27:47.792 --> 27:50.669
whatever they determine
is in your best interest.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.004
If you want to pursue this,
I'll write the order now

27:53.005 --> 27:55.340
and have you remanded
into their care.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.300
- We have no objection to that.
- No, no, no.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.594
I--I need--
I need some time.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.054
I need time to think
about my options.

28:01.055 --> 28:04.266
You don't have time,
and you don't have options.

28:20.157 --> 28:23.201
Your trial will continue now,
Mr. Kaczynski.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.663
These are your lawyers.
You will do as they instruct.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.498
If they say you're
mentally defective,

28:28.499 --> 28:32.670
you will nod and agree
in silence.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.513
Oh!

29:21.051 --> 29:22.887
I'm all right.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.311
He's making a deal.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.022
Ted's gonna plead guilty.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.025
Holy shit!

29:37.693 --> 29:38.986
What'd you say to him?

29:41.614 --> 29:42.948
The truth.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.036
Is it your understanding

29:48.037 --> 29:50.038
that your attorneys
had discussions

29:50.039 --> 29:52.749
with the attorneys for
the government in this case,

29:52.750 --> 29:55.211
concerning your change of plea?

29:55.628 --> 29:57.213
Yes, Your Honor.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.423
Are you entering
this plea voluntarily

30:00.424 --> 30:02.635
because it is
what you want to do?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.723
Yes, Your Honor.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.684
Do you understand
that as part of this plea,

30:11.685 --> 30:13.729
you are waiving
your right to appeal?

30:14.897 --> 30:16.231
I do.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.024
That you are waiving
your right to challenge

30:18.025 --> 30:20.777
any portion of this proceeding
in the future,

30:20.778 --> 30:23.113
including the search warrant?

30:23.697 --> 30:25.407
I understand.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.203
Very well, then.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.122
How do you plead
to all charges?

30:33.624 --> 30:34.667
Guilty.

30:37.503 --> 30:41.089
We will
reconvene for sentencing,

30:41.090 --> 30:43.050
and we'll hear testimony
from the victims,

30:43.384 --> 30:47.012
and you'll be able to make
a statement then if you wish.

30:47.471 --> 30:48.848
Court adjourned.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.603
I hear your jumping on letters
from the Atanta bomber.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.772
You're gonna have a long,
brilliant career

30:57.773 --> 30:59.899
reading nasty letters
from A-holes.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.653
Congrats. A big win, Fitz.
This is a big win.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.942
Before
we proceed with sentencing,

31:42.943 --> 31:46.947
we will hear from those victims
who wish to make a statement.

31:47.656 --> 31:51.534
Susan Mosser,
wife of Thomas Mosser,

31:51.535 --> 31:55.247
who was murdered by the defendant
in December of 1994.

31:56.457 --> 31:57.666
December 10th.

31:59.293 --> 32:00.793
It was supposed to be the day

32:00.794 --> 32:03.714
my family picked out
a Christmas tree.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.720
Instead, it was the day
my husband was murdered.

32:10.888 --> 32:14.140
The excruciating pain
of 100 nails,

32:14.141 --> 32:17.602
cut-up razor blades,
and metal fragments,

32:17.603 --> 32:19.979
burning your skin,

32:19.980 --> 32:22.398
fracturing your skull,

32:22.399 --> 32:25.527
and driving shrapnel
into your brain.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.947
Imagine what it is like

32:28.948 --> 32:30.324
to constantly wonder

32:31.909 --> 32:35.119
what would make a person

32:35.120 --> 32:36.830
want to kill you,

32:38.082 --> 32:41.084
to look down at injuries
that shock you beyond belief,

32:41.085 --> 32:43.878
and to wonder
what has happened and why,

32:43.879 --> 32:46.714
to be overwhelmed
with the feelings of rage

32:46.715 --> 32:50.844
and the heartache of knowing
that you will never again

32:51.595 --> 32:53.639
be the same
as you were before.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.474
We've decided to let him live,

32:56.475 --> 33:00.062
so let him be our living symbol

33:00.521 --> 33:03.856
of cowardice and evil.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.483
He gives us a chance

33:05.484 --> 33:09.571
to look our worst instincts
in the face

33:10.155 --> 33:11.990
and to say to them,

33:11.991 --> 33:14.993
"You will not prevail."

33:14.994 --> 33:17.162
What a message.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.499
Theodore Kaczynski was a victim.

33:22.292 --> 33:24.460
By some convoluted
form of logic,

33:24.461 --> 33:26.296
you've portrayed yourself
as a victim.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.133
As you start your
life sentence in prison,

33:30.134 --> 33:33.012
this is what I wish for you.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.930
Given that your victims
were blinded by your bombs,

33:35.931 --> 33:37.766
may you also be blinded

33:38.475 --> 33:41.519
by being deprived
of the incredible light

33:41.520 --> 33:45.648
of the moon,
the stars, the sun,

33:45.649 --> 33:47.400
the beauty of nature

33:47.401 --> 33:50.069
for the rest of your life.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.779
Given that your victims
lost their hearing

33:51.780 --> 33:53.322
because of your bombs,

33:53.323 --> 33:57.493
may you spend the rest
of your days in stony silence.

33:57.494 --> 34:01.039
And given that your victims
were maimed by your bombs,

34:01.040 --> 34:03.624
may your body be shackled

34:03.625 --> 34:05.585
with the same violence
and hatred

34:05.586 --> 34:08.297
that have already
imprisoned your mind.

34:09.131 --> 34:12.508
And given that your victims
were killed by your bombs,

34:12.509 --> 34:15.304
may your own death occur
as you have lived...

34:16.555 --> 34:17.848
in a solitary manner...

34:19.308 --> 34:21.977
without compassion or love.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.565
The defendant will now
have an opportunity

34:27.566 --> 34:30.861
to make a statement
if he wishes.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.130
Uh...

34:56.095 --> 35:00.098
I only ask that people reserve
their judgment about me

35:00.099 --> 35:05.978
and about the Unabom case

35:05.979 --> 35:08.731
until all the facts
have been made public.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.484
There is so much that...

35:15.572 --> 35:17.449
I'm not, um...

35:33.841 --> 35:35.216
In keeping with the terms

35:35.217 --> 35:37.009
of the plea arrangement,

35:37.010 --> 35:40.013
I sentence Theodore Kaczynski
to life in prison,

35:40.430 --> 35:43.350
plus a 30-year
consecutive prison sentence,

35:43.642 --> 35:46.394
plus three additional
life prison terms

35:46.395 --> 35:48.480
to be served consecutively.

35:50.149 --> 35:54.277
The defendant
committed unspeakable

35:54.278 --> 35:55.611
and monstrous crimes.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.697
I believe that
if he had the opportunity,

35:57.698 --> 36:00.283
he would use
his resourcefulness

36:00.284 --> 36:03.161
to repeat such acts.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.454
Because of the callous nature
of his crimes,

36:05.455 --> 36:08.666
the defendant presents
a grave danger to society.

36:08.667 --> 36:12.587
Therefore, I will recommend
that he serve his life imprisonment

36:12.588 --> 36:14.463
in solitary confinement

36:14.464 --> 36:18.676
at a federal administrative
maximum facility.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.179
I only wish the suffering
I could impose on you

36:21.180 --> 36:23.014
would in any way match
the suffering

36:23.015 --> 36:25.266
of the men and women here.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.143
This matter is adjourned.

36:34.234 --> 36:37.236
Ladies and gentlemen,
David Kaczynski is the real hero

36:37.237 --> 36:39.405
of the Unabom story.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.574
He came forward
when no one else would.

36:41.575 --> 36:43.534
And, after legal expenses,

36:43.535 --> 36:45.620
he will be donating
all of the reward money

36:45.621 --> 36:47.705
to the victims
and their families.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.583
He is truly
an American hero.

36:55.088 --> 36:56.673
I have a statement to read.

36:57.674 --> 37:00.968
Speaking for my mother Wanda,
my wife Linda,

37:00.969 --> 37:02.845
and other members
of our family,

37:02.846 --> 37:07.642
I would like to say that our reaction
to today's plea agreement

37:07.643 --> 37:09.645
is one of deep relief.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.396
We feel it is
the appropriate, just,

37:12.397 --> 37:16.108
and civilized resolution
to this tragedy

37:16.109 --> 37:19.154
in light of Ted's
diagnosed mental illness.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.323
We'd like to thank the FBI
for their care

37:22.324 --> 37:24.450
in investigating this case

37:24.451 --> 37:26.535
and protecting
the public safety.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.412
We thank
the Department of Justice

37:28.413 --> 37:30.414
and prosecution attorneys
for their thorough...

37:30.415 --> 37:32.834
It's over.
It's really over.

38:31.727 --> 38:32.977
Look straight ahead.

38:34.104 --> 38:35.272
Look to your right.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.358
Look to your left.

38:40.027 --> 38:41.360
Open your mouth.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.195
Wide.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.865
Lift your left leg.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.034
Right leg up.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.745
At this point,
I want all your clothes off.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.163
Strip naked.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.331
Arms straight up.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.918
Bend over.
Pull your cheeks apart.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.962
Two loud, forceful coughs.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.592
Left arm down.

39:28.784 --> 39:30.577
Both knees up on the bed.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.705
Left hand.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.459
Right foot.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.672
Look at the wall.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.931
Stay on your knees
until we leave.

40:30.512 --> 40:34.015
So... now what?

40:38.979 --> 40:40.147
Don't know.

40:41.523 --> 40:42.983
Anything we want, right?
