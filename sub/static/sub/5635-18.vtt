Jimmy Jr.,

00:20.923 --> 00:22.757
it's nice of you to walk me
home from school today.

00:22.842 --> 00:25.060
Uh, I'm walking
home next to you.

00:25.061 --> 00:26.178
We go in the same direction.

00:26.179 --> 00:27.512
Hey, look at that cloud.

00:27.513 --> 00:28.814
What does it look like to you?

00:28.815 --> 00:30.431
Uh... I guess it's gonna rain?

00:30.483 --> 00:32.266
You don't see two
people holding hands?

00:32.351 --> 00:34.820
And one of them
might have glasses on?

00:34.821 --> 00:36.688
Uh...

00:36.689 --> 00:38.990
Forecast calls for
palm-on-palm contact?

00:38.991 --> 00:40.659
I don't see it, Tina.

00:40.660 --> 00:41.942
I'm gonna go before
my hair gets wet, though.

00:42.028 --> 00:43.495
Bye.
‭Bye.

00:43.496 --> 00:45.447
Wait for us! You're supposed
to hold our hands

00:45.448 --> 00:46.748
when we cross the street!

00:46.749 --> 00:48.033
Oh, my God, a street!

00:48.034 --> 00:49.169
Yay!

00:50.787 --> 00:52.421
Sorry, Tina.

00:52.422 --> 00:54.623
Think I saw what you were
trying to do there and, uh...

00:54.624 --> 00:55.707
I read you loud and clear.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.259
I don't get it.

00:57.260 --> 00:58.844
I-I thought Jimmy Jr.
and I were clicking.

00:58.845 --> 01:00.128
I think that sometimes you think

01:00.129 --> 01:01.463
that things are romantic

01:01.464 --> 01:03.598
when they're, like, not.
I do?

01:03.599 --> 01:05.634
It's like when we saw
that dog attacking a squirrel

01:05.635 --> 01:07.636
and you thought
they were "really connecting."

01:07.637 --> 01:09.136
They were totally
into each other.

01:09.222 --> 01:11.139
Well, off to spend time
with the elderly.

01:11.140 --> 01:12.607
You mean Mom and Dad?

01:12.608 --> 01:13.975
No, the Thundergirls
are volunteering

01:13.976 --> 01:15.526
at a nursing home
today. Gotta go.

01:15.611 --> 01:17.645
Soak up their wisdom
and sample their puddings!

01:19.148 --> 01:20.732
Tina?
‭That's me.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.400
You're with Meryl, in the room
at the end of the hallway.

01:22.485 --> 01:24.119
She might enjoy it
if you read to her

01:24.120 --> 01:25.704
because her eyesight
is very poor.

01:25.705 --> 01:27.823
So is mine.
That's why I wear these.

01:27.824 --> 01:29.668
Hey, that can be our icebreaker.
‭Mm-hmm.

01:29.742 --> 01:30.741
Hi.

01:30.793 --> 01:32.126
Hi?

01:32.161 --> 01:33.962
Meryl, I'm Tina.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.881
Um, I was expecting
someone older...

01:35.882 --> 01:37.499
and female.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.584
Meryl's my great-aunt.
‭Oh.

01:39.585 --> 01:41.303
Joel, who is that?

01:41.304 --> 01:42.971
I'm Tina from the Thundergirls.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.724
I'm here to spend a minimum
of 45 minutes with you.

01:45.725 --> 01:47.058
Maybe I could read to you?

01:47.059 --> 01:49.060
Oh, you could read me my mail.

01:49.061 --> 01:50.729
Sure!
They don't call me

01:50.730 --> 01:52.764
Tina "I can read
your mail" Belcher for nothing.

01:54.183 --> 01:56.184
Can I get a different one?

01:56.185 --> 01:58.186
Just kidding, j-just kidding.

01:58.187 --> 02:00.105
You'll be fine.

02:01.858 --> 02:03.608
Well, I should get going.

02:03.609 --> 02:05.994
Thanks again for
the birthday check, Aunt Meryl.

02:05.995 --> 02:08.830
Don't spend it all in one place.

02:08.830 --> 02:10.865
I probably will,

02:10.917 --> 02:12.284
because it's only $25.

02:12.285 --> 02:14.586
Joel visits me on his birthday.

02:14.587 --> 02:17.038
And I always give him
a birthday check.

02:17.039 --> 02:18.874
My Aunt Gayle sent me a check,

02:18.875 --> 02:21.178
but I'm not allowed to cash it
until she wins the lottery.

02:21.210 --> 02:23.211
Oh, that's nice.

02:23.212 --> 02:24.880
Should we get readin'?

02:24.881 --> 02:26.181
"Congratulations!"

02:26.182 --> 02:27.381
That's a good start.

02:27.467 --> 02:28.683
Well...
‭Wait.

02:28.684 --> 02:30.051
"You're eligible

02:30.052 --> 02:31.396
for a free trial
gym membership."

02:31.471 --> 02:32.553
Who's it from?

02:32.638 --> 02:33.804
Pretty sure it's from a gym.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.639
I don't know any Jims.

02:35.725 --> 02:37.058
I know a Bert.

02:37.059 --> 02:38.560
Is that what you
were trying to say?

02:38.561 --> 02:40.239
Why don't I put that one
in the junk pile?

02:41.731 --> 02:43.198
Mmm...
Hey, dude?

02:43.199 --> 02:44.566
Who, me?

02:44.567 --> 02:46.150
No. Him.
So, not me?

02:46.235 --> 02:47.819
This burger?
It's phenomenal.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.070
Thank you.
‭You like the coffee?

02:49.071 --> 02:50.290
I made the coffee.

02:50.373 --> 02:51.790
Coffee's good.

02:51.791 --> 02:52.991
I've had peanut butter
on a burger before.

02:52.992 --> 02:54.127
I hated it.
It was terrible.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.960
Oh. Uh... okay.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.913
But, uh...
you made it taste good.

02:57.914 --> 02:59.246
Yeah, man.
Nice dish.

02:59.332 --> 03:01.081
Thanks.
I'm-I'm... glad you like it.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.084
I'm Lionel. Head chef
at Fennel and Fog.

03:03.085 --> 03:05.136
I'm Donny.
Head chef at Succulent.

03:05.137 --> 03:06.805
Wow, I-I've heard of
both of those restaurants.

03:06.806 --> 03:08.590
Succulent!

03:08.591 --> 03:10.892
I have a reservation there
in four weeks at 5:15 p.m.

03:10.893 --> 03:13.228
Don't have a date yet,
but a lot can happen in four weeks.

03:13.229 --> 03:14.896
Do you know if there are

03:14.897 --> 03:16.932
any female reservations for one
around that time?

03:16.933 --> 03:18.483
I'll...
uh, I'll check on that for you.

03:18.484 --> 03:19.767
Make me sound cool.

03:19.819 --> 03:21.019
Should we bring
everyone here tonight?

03:21.020 --> 03:22.320
Oh, yeah!

03:22.321 --> 03:23.604
Hey, can we bring
everyone here tonight?

03:23.656 --> 03:25.739
Um... who's everyone?

03:25.775 --> 03:27.275
Some of our chef buddies,

03:27.276 --> 03:28.910
some of our prep
chefs, sous chefs...

03:28.911 --> 03:30.744
We gotta blow off steam
after work. You know.

03:30.780 --> 03:32.197
Oh, yeah.

03:32.198 --> 03:34.282
Bubble bath, glass of wine,
cookie dough...

03:34.283 --> 03:36.451
Paint just one fingernail,
see what it looks like...

03:36.452 --> 03:37.785
Can we come by around midnight?

03:37.837 --> 03:40.005
Uh, w-we close at 7:00.

03:40.006 --> 03:42.706
Oh, that's no problem.
Open back up. ‭Um...

03:42.792 --> 03:44.292
You're gonna have a bunch
of fellow chefs in here

03:44.293 --> 03:46.127
going crazy for
your crazy good food.

03:46.128 --> 03:48.096
I guess midnight
isn't that late...

03:48.097 --> 03:49.965
and, you know,
I'm usually up around then.

03:49.966 --> 03:51.299
Yeah, to pee.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.978
To pee...
and-and to party.

03:53.052 --> 03:54.184
That's my guy.

03:54.270 --> 03:55.772
Sure, I'll open back up tonight.

03:55.805 --> 03:57.272
Well, count me out.

03:57.273 --> 03:59.474
I got a date with
Mr. Pillow, Mr. Mouth Guard

03:59.475 --> 04:01.943
and my reoccurring dream
about meeting Tyra Banks.

04:01.944 --> 04:04.195
She never remembers me,
but she's nice.

04:05.448 --> 04:06.648
"$16.

04:06.649 --> 04:08.950
$14."

04:08.951 --> 04:10.117
That's less expensive
than the last menu.

04:10.152 --> 04:13.154
Oh.

04:13.155 --> 04:15.040
I fell asleep.

04:15.041 --> 04:16.324
Start over, will you?

04:16.325 --> 04:17.993
That's... um...

04:17.994 --> 04:19.004
I'll just read this last one.

04:19.077 --> 04:21.963
Hey, it's handwritten.

04:21.964 --> 04:23.582
"Dear Meryl,

04:23.583 --> 04:25.300
"I know this might come
as something of a surprise

04:25.301 --> 04:27.969
"and you may not remember me,
but I remember you.

04:27.970 --> 04:29.971
"I saw you at the USO dance
at Morris Hall

04:29.972 --> 04:31.472
almost 60 years ago."

04:31.507 --> 04:33.558
Oh, I remember that dance.

04:33.559 --> 04:36.396
A lot of handsome sailors
at Morris Hall that night.

04:36.479 --> 04:37.478
Handsome sailors.

04:37.513 --> 04:39.431
Yeah.
‭Nice.

04:39.432 --> 04:41.231
"You were wearing
a blue dress and pearls

04:41.317 --> 04:43.685
and you looked
like an angel." Aw!

04:43.686 --> 04:46.321
"I wanted to ask you to dance,
but I was too shy.

04:46.322 --> 04:48.156
And then the dance ended
and I never saw you again."

04:48.157 --> 04:50.108
Oh, no!
Oh, my.

04:50.109 --> 04:51.576
"Now, I'm a retired navy admiral

04:51.577 --> 04:52.861
"and I have lived a full life.

04:52.862 --> 04:54.863
"But I have one regret.

04:54.864 --> 04:57.532
I regret that I didn't ask you
to dance that night." Whoa.

04:57.533 --> 05:00.001
Whoa. ‭"I find myself
thinking about the old days

05:00.002 --> 05:01.536
"and what could have been,

05:01.537 --> 05:03.254
"so I decided to look
you up and reach out.

05:03.255 --> 05:05.005
"I pray this letter
finds you well.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.258
Take care,
Admiral Peter Wilcox."

05:07.259 --> 05:08.843
Wow, Meryl.

05:08.844 --> 05:11.512
Wait, is this
the sushi restaurant?

05:11.547 --> 05:14.298
What? No, it's retired
Navy Admiral Peter Wilcox!

05:14.383 --> 05:15.716
Do you want me
to help you write him back?

05:15.768 --> 05:17.936
Oh, I don't think
I should write him back.

05:17.937 --> 05:20.355
I-I'm too old for...
lovey-dovey stuff.

05:20.356 --> 05:22.439
That's not true! You're never
too old for romance!

05:22.525 --> 05:24.808
Oh, no, no, no.
I have a full life.

05:24.894 --> 05:27.312
We have movie night
every Tuesday.

05:27.313 --> 05:28.780
But you could bring
a date to movie night.

05:28.781 --> 05:30.448
Oh, that's not how
movie night works.

05:30.449 --> 05:32.400
Have you ever been
to movie night?

05:32.401 --> 05:34.068
No.
‭Yeah, it shows.

05:34.153 --> 05:35.787
But what if it's destiny?

05:35.788 --> 05:37.539
What if Admiral Peter Wilcox
is your true love?

05:37.540 --> 05:39.206
Don't you want to find out?

05:39.241 --> 05:41.626
Read me the letter again.
No, no, no, no, don't.

05:41.627 --> 05:44.079
Read me the menu from
the Chinese restaurant again.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.714
Okay. But I just feel like...

05:45.715 --> 05:47.581
Bup, bup, bup.
‭Fine.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.137
$4.95..."

05:51.671 --> 05:53.838
Bob, stop watching
TV and go to bed.

05:53.839 --> 05:55.674
You have to get up
and cook at midnight.

05:55.675 --> 05:57.592
You're gonna be exhausted
if you don't get some sleep.

05:57.593 --> 05:59.260
Yeah, Dad, go to your room.

05:59.261 --> 06:01.813
I'm fine, Lin.
I can stay up until midnight.

06:01.814 --> 06:03.848
And don't forget, these guys
have to work in the morning, too.

06:03.849 --> 06:05.099
Okay.

06:05.184 --> 06:06.818
Gene, Louise, almost
bedtime for you guys.

06:06.819 --> 06:08.436
Two-minute warning.

06:08.437 --> 06:10.939
Wait. I thought Dad
had to go bed, not us.

06:10.940 --> 06:13.024
If Dad has to go bed,
then we can stay up.

06:13.025 --> 06:14.241
It's opposite night!

06:14.276 --> 06:15.359
No, it's not.

06:15.444 --> 06:17.244
So you agree. It is.

06:17.279 --> 06:18.613
No. Yes.

06:18.614 --> 06:19.831
No, wait. Okay.

06:19.832 --> 06:21.282
If it's opposite night,

06:21.283 --> 06:22.700
then you don't
have to go to bed.

06:22.785 --> 06:24.502
You just said it's
opposite night,

06:24.503 --> 06:26.121
which means it's
not opposite night,

06:26.122 --> 06:27.788
which means we don't have
to go to bed, right?

06:27.840 --> 06:29.507
Oh, God.
Wait. Hold on.

06:29.508 --> 06:31.342
Lin, you're letting them
do this to you again.

06:31.343 --> 06:33.094
No. No, Bob, I can do it.

06:33.095 --> 06:34.929
I need a pencil and paper,
and nobody talk.

06:34.930 --> 06:36.264
So everybody talk?

06:36.265 --> 06:37.382
Talk, talk, talk, talk,

06:37.383 --> 06:38.717
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk...

06:38.718 --> 06:40.135
Shush, shush!
Stop it!

06:40.136 --> 06:42.520
Come on, Tina.
It's bedtime soon.

06:42.521 --> 06:44.805
It's not opposite night,
no matter what anybody says.

06:44.857 --> 06:47.225
Okay. I just have to finish
this letter and mail it.

06:47.226 --> 06:48.977
What letter?
Oh, it's, uh...

06:48.978 --> 06:50.445
it's for Thundergirls.

06:50.446 --> 06:52.646
To get my...
letter-mailing patch.

06:52.732 --> 06:54.449
Ah, so specific!

06:54.450 --> 06:56.484
Okay, hurry up.

06:56.485 --> 06:59.154
"Admiral Peter,
I was so thrilled to hear from you.

06:59.155 --> 07:01.322
"I remember that night
like it was yesterday.

07:01.323 --> 07:02.991
"You were so dashing
in your uniform.

07:02.992 --> 07:04.325
"How was the navy?

07:04.326 --> 07:05.577
"Did you eat
a lot of navy beans?

07:05.578 --> 07:06.828
"LOL.

07:06.829 --> 07:08.329
"Anyway, I want you to know

07:08.330 --> 07:09.964
"that I'm not
too old for romance.

07:09.965 --> 07:11.416
"Let's be friends.

07:11.417 --> 07:12.717
"Or maybe more.
Like boyfriend/girlfriend.

07:12.718 --> 07:13.968
"Anyway, take care.

07:13.969 --> 07:16.515
XOXO, Meryl."

07:16.589 --> 07:18.783
Ah! Paper cut!

07:18.784 --> 07:20.519
What? ‭I'm okay.

07:22.747 --> 07:23.981
Whoa.

07:23.982 --> 07:25.699
Bobby?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.692
Where the hell is he?
Someone check the kitchen.

07:28.820 --> 07:29.819
Aah!

07:29.871 --> 07:31.071
I think somebody cooked Dad!

07:31.072 --> 07:32.489
Oh, no!

07:32.490 --> 07:34.407
Did you hear that?

07:34.492 --> 07:35.575
He's over here.

07:35.660 --> 07:37.828
‭Bob. Are you okay?

07:37.829 --> 07:40.413
Who did this to you?
Who did this to you?!

07:40.498 --> 07:42.383
What time is it?
‭lt's 8:00.

07:42.384 --> 07:43.717
I must have passed out.

07:43.718 --> 07:46.220
After Taj and I made
goat massaman curry.

07:46.221 --> 07:47.421
Who's Taj?

07:47.422 --> 07:48.722
He's a friend of Lionel's.

07:50.091 --> 07:51.341
What the hell happened?

07:51.426 --> 07:53.177
Well, it started with me

07:53.178 --> 07:55.728
making a bunch of burgers
for about 15 restaurant people.

07:55.814 --> 07:58.315
Then we drank a lot of wine,

07:58.316 --> 08:00.150
and then Taj brought
a whole goat,

08:00.151 --> 08:02.060
and then we drank some
grain alcohol from Iceland.

08:02.103 --> 08:03.687
Bjork's hard lemonade?

08:03.688 --> 08:05.905
Poor Bob.
I guess you can rest up tonight.

08:05.991 --> 08:07.408
I can't rest tonight.

08:07.409 --> 08:08.826
I'm meeting them at Lionel's.

08:08.827 --> 08:10.411
At midnight.
What?

08:10.412 --> 08:12.446
It was fun, Lin.
Last night.

08:12.447 --> 08:14.031
I-I think I found my people.

08:15.367 --> 08:16.867
All right, I'll be right back.

08:16.868 --> 08:18.535
I-I just have to throw up
a little bit.

08:18.536 --> 08:20.838
All right, kids, come on,
start cleaning up.

08:20.839 --> 08:22.673
Why?
We didn't do this!

08:22.674 --> 08:24.208
Yeah, the party machine did.

08:24.209 --> 08:25.758
Yeah, well,

08:25.844 --> 08:27.711
it's opposite-mess-
you-gotta-clean-up day,

08:27.712 --> 08:29.179
so hop on it.
Let's go.

08:29.180 --> 08:30.431
Hey, if you write a letter

08:30.432 --> 08:31.715
and sign someone else's name,

08:31.716 --> 08:32.933
is that a federal offense?

08:32.933 --> 08:34.885
I'm asking for a friend.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.520
A cool friend you'd really like.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.720
Did you forge a letter, Tina?

08:37.772 --> 08:38.972
No! What? What do you mean?

08:38.972 --> 08:40.274
Why would you even say that...

08:40.275 --> 08:41.274
Okay, fine. I did.

08:41.275 --> 08:42.525
But don't tell Meryl.

08:42.527 --> 08:43.609
Wait. Who's Meryl?

08:43.695 --> 08:45.029
I think that's an expression.

08:45.030 --> 08:46.897
Like, "I just farted.
Don't tell Meryl."

08:46.898 --> 08:48.866
Meryl's my old lady friend
at the nursing home.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.617
She got a beautiful,
romantic letter

08:50.618 --> 08:52.069
from a retired navy admiral.

08:52.070 --> 08:53.537
She didn't want
to write him back,

08:53.538 --> 08:55.538
so I kind of wrote him
back for her.

08:55.573 --> 08:57.207
Tina, Tina, Tina...

08:57.208 --> 08:58.876
Romancing the bones, huh?

08:58.877 --> 09:00.661
Bones that don't want
to be romanced?

09:00.662 --> 09:02.629
Bones that just want
to be left alones?

09:02.630 --> 09:04.798
I know what I'm doing!
I think.

09:04.799 --> 09:05.915
There's another
goat over here!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.551
No, wait, it's a cat.

09:07.552 --> 09:08.752
No, wait, it's
somebody's jacket.

09:26.938 --> 09:30.657
Tina, it's been nice having
you visit me so often.

09:30.658 --> 09:32.276
If you're lonely, you know,

09:32.277 --> 09:33.526
you could get a pet.
‭Yeah.

09:33.611 --> 09:34.945
Finally!
The mail!

09:34.946 --> 09:36.246
I mean, thanks.

09:36.247 --> 09:37.915
He wrote back!

09:37.916 --> 09:39.783
Meryl, I have
a confession to make.

09:39.784 --> 09:42.002
Last week,
when the admiral wrote you a letter

09:42.003 --> 09:44.455
and you didn't want to
write him back... Yeah?

09:44.456 --> 09:46.290
I kind of wrote him back
for you...

09:46.291 --> 09:48.125
and signed your name
instead of mine.

09:48.126 --> 09:50.294
Tina.
Just listen to what he wrote.

09:50.295 --> 09:51.795
"I'm so happy you wrote back.

09:51.796 --> 09:53.263
"Let's go back in time

09:53.264 --> 09:54.465
and recreate the night
of the dance."

09:54.466 --> 09:55.632
Oh...
‭Romantic!

09:55.633 --> 09:56.800
Ah...

09:56.851 --> 09:58.268
"You wear your dress and pearls

09:58.269 --> 10:00.270
"and I'll wear my navy whites

10:00.271 --> 10:01.971
and we'll pretend it's 60 years ago."
Oh.

10:02.056 --> 10:03.724
"And this time,
when the music plays,

10:03.725 --> 10:04.941
I won't lose my nerve."

10:04.976 --> 10:06.643
Oh, my.

10:06.644 --> 10:08.394
That gave me goose bumps.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.280
Is that what this is?

10:10.281 --> 10:11.565
I don't know, it's hard to tell.

10:11.566 --> 10:12.816
It might be shingles.

10:12.817 --> 10:14.284
What should I do?

10:14.285 --> 10:15.369
About the shingles
or about the date?

10:15.370 --> 10:16.820
The date! The date!

10:16.821 --> 10:18.322
Oh, do you have a blue dress?

10:18.323 --> 10:20.457
I think so.
And I still have my pearls.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.159
They're in a storage unit.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.560
I thought I'd never
need them again.

10:23.578 --> 10:25.662
I can get them for you. So?

10:25.663 --> 10:27.413
Should we write the admiral
and make a date for a dance?

10:27.499 --> 10:29.500
Yes! I can't believe
this is happening.

10:29.501 --> 10:31.552
I feel like a schoolgirl!
‭Me, too!

10:31.553 --> 10:32.803
I mean, I am a schoolgirl.

10:32.804 --> 10:34.003
But Yay!
‭Yay!

10:35.423 --> 10:37.508
So pretty.

10:37.509 --> 10:40.010
I wish I were a 90-year-old
going to a dance.

10:40.011 --> 10:41.478
Okay, Mom, that's
enough pearl time.

10:41.479 --> 10:42.513
Give 'em back.

10:42.514 --> 10:44.063
Yeah, it's my turn.
Again?

10:44.149 --> 10:46.984
I helped Tina find them,
I earned double pearl time.

10:46.985 --> 10:48.852
But I drove you to
Meryl's storage unit.

10:48.853 --> 10:49.937
Hmm.

10:49.938 --> 10:51.855
Uh, hi, can I ask a question?

10:51.856 --> 10:53.690
Why does pearl time
have to happen in here

10:53.691 --> 10:55.025
while I'm trying to take a nap?

10:55.026 --> 10:57.077
Why are you taking a nap
during pearl time?

10:57.078 --> 10:58.862
Yeah.
‭No, no, it's okay.

10:58.863 --> 11:00.364
Let's clear out, kids.

11:00.365 --> 11:02.532
Your father needs a disco nap
so he can go party

11:02.534 --> 11:03.534
with his chef friends.

11:03.535 --> 11:04.868
That's not all we do, Lin,

11:04.869 --> 11:05.868
we talk shop.

11:05.870 --> 11:07.838
It's like a chef roundtable

11:07.839 --> 11:10.674
that happens at a round table
at a restaurant

11:10.675 --> 11:12.259
where they sell
a lot of alcohol.

11:12.260 --> 11:13.844
An alcohol restaurant.

11:13.845 --> 11:15.462
You're an amazing
role model, Dad.

11:15.463 --> 11:16.547
Thanks, Louise.

11:16.548 --> 11:19.099
Meryl, I brought the Glam Squad.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.551
Louise, plug in the curlers.

11:20.552 --> 11:21.802
A "please" would be nice.

11:21.803 --> 11:23.103
Gene, plug in the tunes.

11:23.104 --> 11:24.438
I hope you like reggae.

11:24.439 --> 11:25.722
Let's take Meryl

11:25.723 --> 11:27.857
from senior
to have-you-seen-her?

11:29.394 --> 11:31.727
Just a little more blush.

11:31.779 --> 11:32.645
Little more.

11:32.730 --> 11:33.980
Okay, maybe a little less.

11:34.949 --> 11:36.783
Hi, Aunt Meryl.

11:36.784 --> 11:38.451
What's going on in here?

11:38.536 --> 11:39.536
Joel!

11:39.537 --> 11:40.862
Did we have a visit today?

11:40.905 --> 11:43.240
Yeah, we did, it's my birthday.

11:43.241 --> 11:44.908
Oh, of course.

11:44.909 --> 11:46.293
Let me get my checkbook.

11:46.294 --> 11:48.462
Wait, Joel, I thought
your birthday was last week.

11:48.463 --> 11:49.463
Well, you're wrong.

11:49.464 --> 11:50.664
My birthday is today.

11:50.665 --> 11:51.999
Right, Aunt Meryl?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.251
Joel visits every year
on his birthday.

11:54.252 --> 11:55.636
Hmm.

11:55.637 --> 11:57.588
Sounds like, at the rate
you're having birthdays,

11:57.589 --> 11:59.556
pretty soon you're
gonna be older than Meryl.

11:59.557 --> 12:02.676
Uh... can I have a word
with my aunt in private?

12:02.677 --> 12:05.312
I want to talk
about nephew stuff.

12:05.313 --> 12:08.265
Joel puts the "ew" in "nephew."

12:08.266 --> 12:09.433
Yeah, and also the "eh."

12:09.434 --> 12:10.517
Oh, hey, Joel.

12:10.518 --> 12:11.651
We weren't just
talking about you.

12:11.736 --> 12:12.735
Same here.

12:12.770 --> 12:14.655
Happy birthday.

12:14.656 --> 12:16.490
But not today because
it's not your birthday today.

12:16.491 --> 12:18.942
Unless it is
and last week wasn't.

12:18.943 --> 12:20.777
Um...
‭Nailed you.

12:20.778 --> 12:23.113
Now, what should
we do with your hair?

12:23.114 --> 12:24.948
Lady mullet.
I used to wear it up.

12:24.949 --> 12:26.450
Boo.

12:26.451 --> 12:27.618
Tina, question.
Where are the pearls?

12:27.619 --> 12:28.619
On the dresser.

12:28.620 --> 12:29.785
Not anymore.

12:29.837 --> 12:31.088
The pearls.

12:31.089 --> 12:32.088
They're gone.

12:32.123 --> 12:33.790
Joel!

12:33.791 --> 12:37.210
Joel will never be
able to pull those off.

12:38.763 --> 12:42.419
I got a call from a Meryl
Winters about stolen pearls.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.320
Uh, one moment, Sergeant Bosco.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.789
Hey, Meryl, we'll be just a sec.

12:45.790 --> 12:47.341
Nothing happening out here.
Heh.

12:47.342 --> 12:50.348
No problem, I'm happy
to have some alone time.

12:50.411 --> 12:52.345
Sergeant Bosco, we called you.

12:52.413 --> 12:54.180
Meryl has no idea
her pearls were stolen.

12:54.265 --> 12:55.311
Because you kids stole them?

12:55.383 --> 12:56.383
What? No.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.818
Her nephew Joel stole them.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.236
But she doesn't
know that either.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.305
She can't know any of this
until after tonight.

13:01.306 --> 13:03.640
We have a big date with
a retired navy admiral.

13:03.641 --> 13:06.443
Okay, so Joel the nephew
stole the pearls

13:06.444 --> 13:09.196
on the night of the big date
with the retired navy admiral.

13:09.197 --> 13:11.281
Let me just close
my notebook here.

13:11.282 --> 13:13.332
Don't waste my time.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.123
I'm a real policeman.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.453
It's true, there really are
stolen pearls.

13:16.454 --> 13:18.037
But we need to keep it a secret.

13:18.123 --> 13:19.456
I've got a secret for you.

13:19.457 --> 13:20.457
I'm leaving.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.791
That's not how secrets work!

13:21.876 --> 13:23.427
I'll let you know
if anything turns up

13:23.428 --> 13:26.180
in the process of
my exhaustive investigation.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.180
Hello, Mother.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.931
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

13:28.967 --> 13:30.517
Tina, you okay?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.969
Yep, I was just saying,

13:31.970 --> 13:34.309
"Damn it, this dance is gonna be
damn great. Damn it!"

13:35.857 --> 13:37.773
Here you go.
Burger of the Day, Teddy.

13:37.809 --> 13:39.225
Uh... what is it?

13:39.310 --> 13:41.562
Well, it's an open-faced burger
with ketchup gel

13:41.563 --> 13:43.229
and emulsified cheese.

13:43.314 --> 13:44.531
Where's the bun?
It's on the bottom.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.699
Why would you put it
on the bottom?

13:45.700 --> 13:47.034
It's supposed to be
on the top, eh.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.869
Because it's
a new presentation, Teddy.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.820
Where's the lettuce?
It's under the foam.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.632
What, am I supposed to
wash my hands in this?

13:52.657 --> 13:53.907
Gross.
‭

13:53.908 --> 13:55.792
Taj and I came up
with it last night.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.578
It sounded good when
we were talking about it,

13:57.579 --> 13:59.962
but I realized today it
takes me an hour to make.

13:59.998 --> 14:01.748
Eh, a little more.

14:01.749 --> 14:03.717
While we're on the subject
of being a little "eh,"

14:03.718 --> 14:05.673
what's with the coat?
His friend Lionel gave it to him.

14:05.753 --> 14:06.887
The jacket looks good,

14:06.888 --> 14:09.006
but you, on the other hand, ugh.

14:09.007 --> 14:10.924
Yeah, I don't feel so great.

14:10.925 --> 14:12.508
I mean, last night
was pretty crazy.

14:12.594 --> 14:14.344
Lionel wanted to go
to the fish market

14:14.345 --> 14:16.346
to get first pick of
the line-caught swordfish,

14:16.347 --> 14:19.182
but we never made it 'cause
we kept stopping off for drinks.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.522
Geez, Bob, you're really
burning the candle at both ends.

14:21.603 --> 14:23.320
You can't keep this up, Bob.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.072
I know you think these
are your people,

14:25.073 --> 14:27.407
but you're old enough to be
their not very cool uncle.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.575
Well, I'm pretty sure
we're all staying in tonight.

14:29.661 --> 14:32.329
I mean, we got to take
a break at some point.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.331
Ugh, Lionel wants
to meet a restaurant

14:34.332 --> 14:35.581
in Little Romania tonight.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.251
I'm not gonna go.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.620
He says I'm going.
I guess I'm going.

14:39.621 --> 14:41.705
But I-I'm not gonna drink.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.924
"We're all drinking tsuica."

14:43.925 --> 14:45.626
It's Romanian
schnapps apparently.

14:45.627 --> 14:46.710
Oh, my God.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.212
Well, it was nice
knowing you, Bob.

14:48.213 --> 14:50.297
I'll take good care
of Linda and the kids for you.

14:50.298 --> 14:51.548
Thanks, Teddy.

14:51.549 --> 14:53.383
You need any help
with your dress, Meryl?

14:53.384 --> 14:55.802
I'm okay.
I don't remember...

14:55.803 --> 14:57.054
being a turtleneck.

14:57.055 --> 14:58.805
You have your head
through the arm hole.

14:58.806 --> 15:00.607
But other than that,
you look great.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.309
So what do we do
about the necklace?

15:02.310 --> 15:03.693
Look, chalky white mints.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.895
They're not that good.
Avoid.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.698
No, if we get some
dental floss and some glue,

15:07.699 --> 15:08.699
we'll have some pearls.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.617
Some fresh smelling pearls.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.236
So we're not gonna tell her
that her nephew stole her necklace.

15:13.321 --> 15:15.405
Later, after the dance.
We'll break it to her then,

15:15.406 --> 15:17.407
and she'll be so in love
with the admiral,

15:17.408 --> 15:18.992
that she won't even care
that her nephew's a thief.

15:18.993 --> 15:19.992
I just know it.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.411
The admiral.

15:21.412 --> 15:23.547
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.299
There is no admiral.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.967
What?
‭What?

15:26.968 --> 15:28.751
Joel comes every week
and gets a $25 birthday check,

15:28.836 --> 15:30.304
but he wants more.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.306
And he knows
Aunt Meryl has pearls,

15:32.307 --> 15:33.907
but he doesn't know
where she keeps them.

15:33.925 --> 15:36.175
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Nodding along but confused.

15:36.261 --> 15:40.264
Joel creates the admiral
and this romantic dance baloney

15:40.265 --> 15:41.732
so she'll take her pearls out

15:41.733 --> 15:43.316
from wherever
she's storing them,

15:43.401 --> 15:45.569
and once they're here,
they're easy to swipe.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.603
Joel sent that letter,
don't you see?

15:47.689 --> 15:49.105
No, it can't be.

15:49.190 --> 15:51.858
Come on, Tina, Joel shows up
on the exact same day

15:51.859 --> 15:54.026
the admiral's supposed to come?

15:54.112 --> 15:55.579
Isn't that a little
coincidental?

15:55.580 --> 15:57.114
"You wear your dress and pearls,

15:57.115 --> 15:58.699
and I'll wear my navy whites."

15:58.700 --> 16:00.117
Whites. Whites.

16:00.118 --> 16:01.785
And I still have my pearls.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.370
They're in a storage unit.

16:03.371 --> 16:04.755
Unit. Unit.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.873
Can I have a word
with my aunt in private?

16:06.874 --> 16:09.259
Private. Private.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.459
Oh, my God.

16:10.545 --> 16:12.346
When you replied
to "the admiral,"

16:12.347 --> 16:14.181
you set this whole thing
in motion.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.566
Sorry, T, this romance
is a "faux-mance."

16:16.567 --> 16:19.036
Huh, huh, huh, huh.

16:19.037 --> 16:21.038
Tina, are you okay?

16:21.039 --> 16:23.206
Meryl, we have something
to tell you.

16:23.207 --> 16:25.207
I have something
to tell you, too.

16:25.243 --> 16:29.029
I haven't had anything to look
forward to in quite some time.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.415
They're not
as "handsy-outsy" with the meds

16:31.416 --> 16:34.051
as they used to be around here.

16:34.052 --> 16:37.453
But tonight I have something
to look forward to.

16:37.488 --> 16:38.789
Thanks to you, Tina.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.707
I'm Gene.
‭Where's Tina?

16:40.708 --> 16:41.742
I'm over here.

16:41.743 --> 16:43.160
Tina, move your arms around.

16:43.161 --> 16:44.461
It'll help me see.

16:45.913 --> 16:48.964
There you are,
my magnificent matchmaker.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.967
Uh...

16:50.968 --> 16:52.968
Uh, Meryl, will you excuse us
for a second?

16:53.004 --> 16:54.170
Okay.

16:54.255 --> 16:56.006
You guys,
the admiral might not be real,

16:56.007 --> 16:58.008
but Meryl's dance can be.
Huh?

16:58.009 --> 17:00.510
This can still work.
We just need an admiral.

17:00.511 --> 17:03.013
So her nephew fooled her
and now we're gonna fool her, too?

17:03.014 --> 17:04.848
But we're fooling her for love,
not for money.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.516
I'll tell her the truth
after the dance.

17:06.517 --> 17:08.852
Well, that won't be
a totally awkward conversation.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.237
Meryl, get ready because
the admiral is on his way.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.011
After we find an admiral.

17:13.012 --> 17:14.779
And after we find more mints.

17:16.262 --> 17:19.701
This hat was once a Tom Skerritt
in Top Gun Halloween costume

17:19.702 --> 17:21.051
and now look at it.
Hmm.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.621
I think this is gonna work.

17:22.622 --> 17:24.373
He's starting to look
like a real admiral, sort of.

17:24.374 --> 17:25.874
‭And we found a good use

17:25.875 --> 17:27.576
‭for
your super special chef jacket.

17:27.577 --> 17:30.212
This is such, such a bad idea.

17:30.213 --> 17:31.296
Shh.
It's all a dream.

17:31.297 --> 17:32.464
Go back to sleep.

17:32.465 --> 17:33.999
He's weak, he can't stop us.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.717
Keep taping.
I got to sit down.

17:35.718 --> 17:37.418
You are sitting down, Dad.
Oh, my God.

17:37.503 --> 17:38.837
So you think Meryl won't notice

17:38.838 --> 17:40.554
this cheese on
your father's shoulders?

17:40.640 --> 17:42.140
Her eyesight is really bad.

17:42.141 --> 17:44.393
So you think she won't notice
there's a little bite out of it?

17:44.394 --> 17:46.010
Mom, don't eat
the shoulder cheese.

17:46.062 --> 17:47.179
Aw.

17:47.180 --> 17:48.512
I really need a nap.

17:48.564 --> 17:50.182
Damn it, sailor,
you can nap after

17:50.183 --> 17:51.817
you've given Meryl
a night of romance.

17:51.818 --> 17:54.186
That means a smooch, too,
if she wants it.

17:54.187 --> 17:55.820
Gene.
‭Mm.

17:57.323 --> 17:59.358
Okay, Meryl, you ready?

17:59.359 --> 18:00.359
I think so.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.610
You look great,

18:01.611 --> 18:03.495
and your pearls have
never looked more real.

18:03.496 --> 18:06.197
Thank you.
Hit it, Gene.

18:07.450 --> 18:08.624
Oh.

18:12.622 --> 18:13.537
Um...

18:13.589 --> 18:14.756
Hello, Meryl.

18:14.757 --> 18:16.792
I'm Peter, uh...

18:16.793 --> 18:18.209
retired Admiral

18:18.294 --> 18:19.678
of the Navy.

18:19.679 --> 18:20.544
Peter, hi.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.547
Good evening, Admiral.

18:22.548 --> 18:25.182
You look as beautiful
as I remember.

18:25.218 --> 18:27.143
You look official.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.054
May I have this dance?

18:29.055 --> 18:30.689
I'd be honored.

18:30.690 --> 18:31.940
It's working.

18:31.941 --> 18:33.642
Aw, they look so cute together.

18:33.643 --> 18:35.894
I hope they have weird, old babies.

18:35.895 --> 18:37.729
Aw, weird, old babies.

18:39.148 --> 18:40.949
Is that cheese?
‭Oh. Yeah.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.118
I was, uh, given...

18:43.119 --> 18:45.737
the cheese by the Swiss Navy.

18:45.738 --> 18:48.407
What's... happening
to your uniform?

18:48.408 --> 18:50.491
It's, um... it's old.

18:50.576 --> 18:51.710
Oh, no.

18:51.711 --> 18:53.078
You tried, T.

18:53.079 --> 18:54.963
I got to tell her.

18:54.964 --> 18:56.581
Meryl?

18:59.969 --> 19:01.420
What the hell?
Who's that?

19:01.421 --> 19:03.304
The male nurses here
really dress up.

19:03.389 --> 19:04.505
Who are you?

19:04.590 --> 19:06.842
It's me, Admiral Peter Wilcox.

19:06.843 --> 19:07.641
Huh? ‭Huh?
‭What?!

19:07.727 --> 19:08.760
Oh, my God.

19:08.761 --> 19:10.312
Oh, my God, the admiral's real.

19:10.313 --> 19:12.264
But who are you?
‭Oh, uh,

19:12.265 --> 19:15.100
I guess I'm not
Admiral Peter Wilcox.

19:15.101 --> 19:17.569
I'm, um, Admiral
William... P-Peacocks.

19:17.570 --> 19:19.153
Wh-What a mix-up.

19:19.238 --> 19:20.605
Dismissed!
Dismissed!

19:20.606 --> 19:21.940
Oh. Right. Uh...

19:21.941 --> 19:23.774
Excuse me.
Admiral.

19:23.826 --> 19:25.077
Admiral?

19:25.078 --> 19:27.529
Meryl, may I finally
have this dance?

19:27.530 --> 19:29.114
Uh... y-yes.

19:29.115 --> 19:31.500
That other one was too
old for me, I think.

19:31.501 --> 19:33.452
And soft. I mean, I like Jell-O,

19:33.453 --> 19:35.504
but I don't want
to dance with it.

19:35.505 --> 19:37.455
I don't get it.
The admiral is real?

19:37.540 --> 19:39.708
I guess I was right
about all this romance stuff.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.293
I knew it!
I mean, I doubted it,

19:41.294 --> 19:42.594
but before that, I knew it.

19:42.595 --> 19:44.212
All right,
maybe the admiral is real,

19:44.213 --> 19:46.047
but Joel still took the pearls.

19:46.048 --> 19:48.300
That's not romantic,
that's cold-blooded.

19:50.219 --> 19:51.470
Oh, my God, the pearls!

19:51.471 --> 19:53.688
Whoa. Meryl had the pearls
in her purse.

19:53.689 --> 19:55.223
They weren't stolen at all.

19:55.224 --> 19:57.309
Hey, you were wrong
about everything, Louise.

19:57.310 --> 19:59.644
Okay,
that's not how I'd put it.

19:59.645 --> 20:02.197
Hooray for romance!
True love does exist.

20:02.198 --> 20:04.533
Remind me to tell Jimmy Jr.
that true love exists.

20:04.534 --> 20:06.151
Oh, you're gonna make his day.

20:06.152 --> 20:07.736
Hey, should we call
Sergeant Bosco

20:07.737 --> 20:09.654
and let him know
we found the pearls?

20:09.655 --> 20:12.457
Nah. I'm sure he's totally
forgotten about this case.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.825
Joel Glassman?

20:13.826 --> 20:14.959
Yes?

20:14.994 --> 20:16.912
Sergeant Bosco. Robbery.

20:16.913 --> 20:18.713
Oh, my God! Is this
about the birthday checks?

20:18.714 --> 20:20.881
I swear to God I'll stop.
I'll rip up the check.

20:20.967 --> 20:23.251
I-I'll give her
all the money back!

20:23.252 --> 20:24.803
I... Oh, my God!

20:26.172 --> 20:27.923
Stop crying.
Stop crying.

20:27.924 --> 20:29.474
I-I'm not crying!

20:29.475 --> 20:31.258
Stop crying.
‭I'm not crying!

20:32.895 --> 20:34.012
Bob! Bob!

20:34.013 --> 20:35.679
Bob! Bob!
What the hell is that?

20:35.765 --> 20:37.849
It's them! Turn off the TV!

20:37.850 --> 20:39.483
Okay, okay, okay.
Get on the floor. Get down.

20:39.519 --> 20:40.819
We know you're up there!

20:40.820 --> 20:42.737
We saw you turn off the TV!

20:42.738 --> 20:44.322
Make us a burger!

20:44.323 --> 20:46.324
They won't stop.
They're never gonna stop.

20:46.325 --> 20:47.526
I'm so scared.

20:47.527 --> 20:49.077
All right, calm down, calm down.

20:49.078 --> 20:51.196
How about this?
I'll tell them you died.

20:51.197 --> 20:52.863
Great idea. Thank you.
Love you.

20:52.949 --> 20:54.637
He's dead! Go away! He's dead!
