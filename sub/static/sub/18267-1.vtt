03:31.374 --> 03:32.257
Boy!

03:32.282 --> 03:34.872
What kind of music is this?
I've never heard it before.

03:34.943 --> 03:35.716
Cavara.

03:36.497 --> 03:38.075
Is somebody behind you?

03:38.551 --> 03:39.442
Come out.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.926
I'd like to see who's sleeping on the job
instead of working.

03:43.165 --> 03:44.665
Oh. I see...

03:44.891 --> 03:47.446
Carrying on inside my wagon, are you?

03:50.141 --> 03:51.141
Let's go.

03:52.813 --> 03:53.813
Come on.

03:54.336 --> 03:55.500
Such thrash.

03:56.594 --> 03:57.601
Go on!

04:02.735 --> 04:05.602
Did you clean all ze bottles
and test tubes in ze laboratory?

04:05.757 --> 04:07.085
Yes Baron, I did.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.311
I worked ze whole night
to clean up everything.

04:09.393 --> 04:11.885
And why do ze studio look
in such a mess lately?

04:12.736 --> 04:14.572
How could it?
I fixed up all ze things.

04:14.977 --> 04:17.382
You know I like things clean and bright.

04:17.485 --> 04:19.336
How can I work in a mess like that?

04:22.111 --> 04:25.228
When I was study under professor
Blümberg and Fringhs

04:25.643 --> 04:28.376
We had to wipe ze floors for two years.

04:28.470 --> 04:31.001
Before I could stick my nose
into ze laboratory.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.913
But Baron?
You know I believe in your work.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.570
We worked so hard together.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.188
We did everything in ze laboratory.

04:36.213 --> 04:38.305
And I'm so grateful to you
that I could do that.

04:38.617 --> 04:39.945
I know, I know...

04:39.970 --> 04:40.712
Otto.

04:40.774 --> 04:42.430
You've been a very good assistant.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.477
And you brought in some good parts.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.845
That Manus was perfect.

04:49.049 --> 04:50.401
Thank you Baron.

04:50.847 --> 04:53.706
But what we really need now
is ze perfect...

04:54.808 --> 04:56.112
'nasum.'

04:56.409 --> 04:57.191
Yes.

04:57.335 --> 05:00.405
Somezing that will
represent ze finest feature

05:00.851 --> 05:03.117
of ze Serbian ideals.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.154
What do you mean by this?
Serbian ideals?

05:05.179 --> 05:06.943
I have never heard
about it before.

05:07.029 --> 05:08.779
But Otto, you don't understand.

05:09.072 --> 05:10.510
Ze Serbian race

05:10.535 --> 05:12.221
comes in direct descent

05:12.541 --> 05:15.276
of ze glory from ze ancient Greeks!

05:15.361 --> 05:16.674
Oh, I didn't know that.

05:16.939 --> 05:17.899
But...

05:17.924 --> 05:20.010
Where will you find those kind of nose?

05:20.459 --> 05:22.045
In town Otto.
In town.

05:22.070 --> 05:23.081
Oohh...

05:23.784 --> 05:25.573
I remember when I went to school.

05:26.269 --> 05:29.230
Our guvernante was taking my sister
and myself every day to school.

05:29.420 --> 05:31.123
And I saw this creature of ze road.

05:31.249 --> 05:32.882
But we were not allowed to play with them.

05:32.949 --> 05:34.488
Because we were somezing better.

05:34.513 --> 05:35.511
They're peasants.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.597
They told us.

05:37.902 --> 05:40.058
More than once I escaped.

05:40.419 --> 05:41.771
Standing there for hours in ze field

05:41.796 --> 05:43.373
watching zese creatures

05:44.211 --> 05:46.984
Now our studies come finally to an end.

05:47.429 --> 05:49.968
We got a beautiful female.

05:50.838 --> 05:52.010
And I'm sure

05:52.035 --> 05:53.916
among zis town people

05:54.049 --> 05:56.580
we will just find ze perfect...

05:57.265 --> 05:58.555
'nasum'.

06:45.940 --> 06:47.128
Stop now.

06:48.855 --> 06:49.900
Come on.

06:50.261 --> 06:51.284
Let's go.

06:51.573 --> 06:53.157
Come on children. Go on, go on.

06:54.463 --> 06:55.541
Ah! Baron.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.939
You wouldn't believe what a day I've had.

07:00.283 --> 07:03.314
I had to remove the children from
the rotten school in town.

07:03.412 --> 07:04.996
It was you who choosed school, my dear.

07:05.021 --> 07:07.309
Yes, I did like the school.
But I didn't know that those...

07:07.334 --> 07:09.801
dirty little...
Tell me more about it at dinner.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.983
At dinner...

07:13.267 --> 07:14.298
Ohh!

07:15.525 --> 07:17.056
Come on. Let's go.

07:19.213 --> 07:20.729
Still got to be time for us.

07:21.002 --> 07:23.331
Always running off
to that stupid laboratory.

08:01.338 --> 08:02.869
What a mess in this room.

08:03.588 --> 08:05.104
How' you keep your room this way?

08:05.361 --> 08:06.516
I've told you that a hundred times.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.213
What's the point of having beautiful things

08:08.238 --> 08:10.141
if you children do just not care about it.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.806
Look at the dolls on the floor.

08:11.915 --> 08:13.087
We shouldn't be doing this.

08:13.383 --> 08:14.461
You know that.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.500
Now, come on. Take your clothes of and

08:17.525 --> 08:19.164
you put your play clothes on.

08:19.492 --> 08:20.445
All right?

08:20.550 --> 08:21.261
Go ahead.

08:21.286 --> 08:22.261
Now I must tell you something.

08:22.286 --> 08:25.045
I'm very glad that you have left
that terrible school.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.905
The children at this school
are not on par with you.

08:28.499 --> 08:30.342
You are very special.
You are different.

08:31.373 --> 08:34.342
They are jealous and tell awful tales
about your mother and you father.

08:35.022 --> 08:36.030
<i>Olga!</i>

08:36.904 --> 08:39.107
Mm. Some of things they say are true.

08:48.016 --> 08:49.774
When they talk about your mother...

08:50.995 --> 08:52.690
Sometimes they tell things
that are true.

08:52.715 --> 08:54.432
And sometimes they tell lies

08:54.457 --> 08:55.440
because they are jealous.

08:55.465 --> 08:57.542
People who are jealous always tell lies.

08:57.706 --> 08:59.089
Give me the brush.

09:00.152 --> 09:01.066
Madame.

09:01.091 --> 09:02.247
Merci.

09:04.189 --> 09:05.752
I'm goin' to make you beautiful.

09:05.777 --> 09:08.557
You will always have to surround yourself
with beautiful things.

09:09.775 --> 09:11.486
I like the way you look.

09:12.079 --> 09:13.423
And your brother.

09:13.634 --> 09:14.899
I've always...

09:14.924 --> 09:16.329
looked for beauty.

09:16.354 --> 09:17.859
That matter of fact...

09:17.884 --> 09:19.484
I insist on it.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.606
Liver and kidney are removed.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.215
Did you put them in a storage bottle?

11:15.248 --> 11:16.403
Yes I did.

11:16.723 --> 11:18.348
Let's get rid of this useless krank.

11:18.373 --> 11:19.864
Yes baron. Yes.

12:18.356 --> 12:20.130
Ze children should be sent abroad.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.919
Their education will progress
much faster there.

12:22.944 --> 12:25.051
Absolutely not.
They will learn far more from us.

12:25.574 --> 12:27.511
Besides, I don't want
them away from the house.

12:27.738 --> 12:29.707
But it is only in
their own interest.

12:30.799 --> 12:33.127
Mother and Father are coming
to visit us in a fortnight,

12:33.152 --> 12:34.635
and they too, are against it.

12:34.859 --> 12:36.124
You know that very well.

12:36.383 --> 12:37.258
Hmm...

12:37.344 --> 12:39.429
Good God. I'm not looking forward
to their visit.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.237
All they ever do is pry into our affairs.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.386
Trying to arrange our lives.

12:44.526 --> 12:45.292
Erich.

12:45.317 --> 12:46.581
You should eat some soup.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.993
What do you pick on the boy for?

12:48.079 --> 12:50.266
Because he doesn't look
very strong to me lately.

12:50.415 --> 12:51.923
Well, he looks very well to me.

12:59.353 --> 13:01.242
I was just thinking about a few years back.

13:01.267 --> 13:03.796
On a trip I took with mother
to Saint Petersburg

13:03.821 --> 13:05.281
to visit her brother.

13:05.811 --> 13:08.202
When I met that beautiful
Russian ballet dancer...

13:08.828 --> 13:09.781
who journeyed...

13:09.898 --> 13:11.554
after me to Monte Carlo.

13:11.639 --> 13:12.591
As a matter of fact you were there.

13:12.616 --> 13:14.311
You remember you came
with father to the

13:14.336 --> 13:15.350
Hotel de París?

13:15.375 --> 13:16.842
Yes I do.
- Mm.

13:17.487 --> 13:18.698
What happened then?

13:20.137 --> 13:21.081
Mother

13:21.106 --> 13:22.637
took him for herself.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.817
Mother is a very religious woman.

13:24.949 --> 13:27.129
She was only acting in your own interest.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.705
Religious woman?

13:30.810 --> 13:33.076
Why must you always pick on mozer?

13:33.191 --> 13:34.269
I don't pick on mother.

13:36.595 --> 13:37.900
I think she's very selfish.

13:38.594 --> 13:41.071
She left you all ze jewelry,
didn't she?

13:41.336 --> 13:43.033
Father left you all the property.

13:43.111 --> 13:45.644
It was always like that in our family.

13:47.162 --> 13:49.082
Father didn't like me very much either.

13:50.451 --> 13:52.762
Now you have your pick on father.

13:53.142 --> 13:54.749
Didn't he take you to Paris?

13:54.774 --> 13:56.222
Oh, you have to bring that up.

13:56.546 --> 13:58.666
Do you know what I did?
I stayed

13:58.711 --> 14:00.966
the entire trip

14:00.991 --> 14:03.837
in my hotel suite
while he was out with some tramp.

14:04.485 --> 14:05.869
I don't understand.

14:05.894 --> 14:08.960
Why you have to discuss this all
in front of our children?

14:10.669 --> 14:11.695
The children.

14:13.124 --> 14:15.390
What am I going to do with them
now that they're out of school?

14:16.495 --> 14:18.448
Why don't you take them to picnic tomorrow?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.564
Picnic?!

14:28.427 --> 14:30.615
They got you diggin' another one
of these damn holes.

14:32.735 --> 14:34.096
Wonder what they put in 'em.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.218
I don't know.

14:36.485 --> 14:37.914
I just dig them.

14:39.689 --> 14:41.240
You know, I've been wantin'
to talk to you.

14:41.553 --> 14:42.591
About what?

14:42.893 --> 14:44.009
Well...

14:45.676 --> 14:47.116
Are you really serious?

14:47.141 --> 14:48.634
About wantin' to be a...

14:49.538 --> 14:50.475
Monk?

14:51.022 --> 14:52.305
Yeah.

14:52.330 --> 14:53.489
I am.

14:54.025 --> 14:55.308
I wanna live a

14:55.333 --> 14:56.549
cloistered life.

14:57.485 --> 14:59.461
You mean walk around in those clothes
- Yeah.

14:59.584 --> 15:01.459
And pray all the time?
- I will do it.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.059
I've never heard you pray.
I've never ever <i>seen</i> you pray.

15:04.338 --> 15:07.250
Now, all of a sudden, that's what you
wanna do for the rest of your life.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.981
Monks work in the field.

15:09.037 --> 15:10.421
Just like we do.

15:10.888 --> 15:12.573
It's not a big difference.

15:12.796 --> 15:13.756
Yes, but...

15:13.781 --> 15:15.084
Do you know what they eat?

15:15.397 --> 15:16.434
Bread.

15:16.502 --> 15:17.472
With water.

15:17.497 --> 15:19.292
And that doesn't bother you?

15:19.580 --> 15:21.232
Not too much. It's okay.

15:22.348 --> 15:23.184
I don't understand this.

15:23.209 --> 15:24.747
We've been friends all our lives

15:25.116 --> 15:26.756
If you really wanna
be a monk now,

15:26.781 --> 15:27.952
that's up to you.

15:28.269 --> 15:29.798
But you know what you are giving up?

15:30.390 --> 15:31.685
It's okay.

15:31.896 --> 15:34.329
You never come with me
when I go to see the girls in town.

15:34.452 --> 15:35.590
Because...

15:35.615 --> 15:37.175
I want to join the order.

15:37.768 --> 15:39.286
Why don't you come with me just once.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.355
Don't worry. If you don't know
what to do, just watch me.

15:43.092 --> 15:44.754
You'll get the idea.

15:48.418 --> 15:49.512
Okay.

15:50.527 --> 15:52.748
It's a problem with ze fallopian tube.

15:53.116 --> 15:55.672
I have to replace it,
to make it stronger.

15:56.610 --> 15:58.875
What other parts
did you take away from that man?

15:58.987 --> 16:00.270
These, Baron.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.115
Perfect specimen.

16:14.404 --> 16:15.286
Yes.

16:15.311 --> 16:16.926
Seminal vesicles.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.880
But it's too long.

16:18.947 --> 16:20.654
We have to replace part of it.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.109
Prepare it now.

17:17.348 --> 17:19.336
What a hill to climb.

17:20.776 --> 17:21.780
Look!

17:21.892 --> 17:23.577
The shepherds doesn't even care of the lambs.

17:23.633 --> 17:24.526
How sweet.

17:24.550 --> 17:26.707
Come on. Let's build a cover over here and

17:26.733 --> 17:28.507
we'll have something to eat.

17:29.266 --> 17:30.728
Go on.

17:32.447 --> 17:33.429
That's the idea.

17:33.454 --> 17:35.208
No no no no.
The other way

17:36.358 --> 17:37.864
Go ahead.

17:38.411 --> 17:39.538
That's it.

17:40.521 --> 17:42.295
Ohh!
My apples.

17:42.518 --> 17:43.444
Ohh!

17:43.469 --> 17:45.263
They're rolling all over the place.

17:45.665 --> 17:46.603
Come on.

17:46.628 --> 17:47.931
Help me pick the up.

17:49.509 --> 17:50.971
Look. There's two over there.

17:56.328 --> 17:58.181
What's been going on around here?

17:59.117 --> 18:00.847
Put your clothes back on.

18:03.425 --> 18:05.467
And get out of here,
you filthy whore!

18:10.109 --> 18:11.716
It's you again.

18:13.746 --> 18:15.208
I want to speak to you.

18:18.438 --> 18:20.603
Go back to the Barnes you...

18:20.904 --> 18:22.623
And take your friends with you.

18:25.112 --> 18:26.116
Come on up.

18:38.759 --> 18:40.645
What's been going on at my property?

18:42.917 --> 18:44.022
I want to know.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.009
Just watching after the sheep.

18:46.521 --> 18:47.850
And the girl?

18:48.073 --> 18:49.702
She was just passing by.

18:49.892 --> 18:51.878
How long have you been at her employ?

18:52.559 --> 18:53.530
Short time.

18:53.555 --> 18:54.970
And who employed you.

18:55.182 --> 18:56.209
The foreman.

18:56.286 --> 18:58.328
Hm. Yes.
I've seen you before.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.704
You know I'm going to have to speak
to my husband about you.

19:05.505 --> 19:07.682
As a matter of fact I...

19:07.707 --> 19:09.592
think I want to see
you tomorrow morning.

19:10.204 --> 19:11.789
At the castle.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.226
Is that understood?

19:16.410 --> 19:17.437
Yes.

19:20.528 --> 19:22.269
Marika! Erik!

19:23.866 --> 19:25.753
Let's move everything away from here.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.815
Some people don't know
how to behave themselves.

19:44.018 --> 19:45.357
We have to find

19:45.382 --> 19:47.089
the right head for zis torso.

19:49.449 --> 19:52.507
It has to be of a man who has strong way with women.

19:53.534 --> 19:55.297
Who's overriding urges

19:55.322 --> 19:56.848
are sensual.

19:58.745 --> 20:00.173
If we succeed

20:00.198 --> 20:02.194
In finding such a

20:02.517 --> 20:04.292
single minded man

20:04.370 --> 20:06.100
our chances are very good...

20:07.082 --> 20:08.723
That ze male we create...

20:09.324 --> 20:11.043
will fall in love with my

20:11.068 --> 20:12.685
female zombie.

20:13.975 --> 20:15.348
They will mate.

20:15.944 --> 20:18.187
And she will bear me the children I want.

20:19.515 --> 20:20.910
They're going to be a...

20:20.935 --> 20:22.495
true start...

20:22.896 --> 20:24.326
of a new race.

20:24.482 --> 20:26.948
Entirely created by me.

20:28.158 --> 20:30.602
Responding only to my bidding.

20:37.466 --> 20:38.627
But so far...

20:38.695 --> 20:41.429
we have not find a suitable mate for her.

20:53.256 --> 20:55.198
I know where to find such a man.

20:55.890 --> 20:57.776
I've been once to a house in town.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.383
Certain kind of house.

20:59.469 --> 21:01.177
You mean a bordello, Baron?

21:01.202 --> 21:02.695
- Yes.
You, Baron?

21:02.731 --> 21:05.295
Yes, Why?!
You zink I've never been to one?

21:05.320 --> 21:06.490
Ohh...

21:08.856 --> 21:10.463
While I was in medical school.

21:11.112 --> 21:12.306
Most of ze boys

21:12.331 --> 21:13.935
used to go to such a place.

21:14.304 --> 21:16.335
They always wanted me to go with them.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.043
Knowing what kind of good student I was.

21:19.370 --> 21:21.122
Never leaving my books.

21:21.289 --> 21:22.774
Not even for one hour.

21:23.522 --> 21:25.709
And still I was foolish enough...

21:25.943 --> 21:28.231
to want to be accepted in their company.

21:28.841 --> 21:30.772
Once I left my books,
and I went wiz them.

21:30.797 --> 21:32.066
What happened?

21:32.345 --> 21:34.131
It was terrible.

21:34.421 --> 21:36.229
All these over developed women.

21:36.254 --> 21:37.888
With their large breasts.

21:38.022 --> 21:39.517
And shapeless.

21:40.164 --> 21:42.776
And this kind of women
is supposed to give you pleasure.

21:43.246 --> 21:45.322
With their filthy movement.

21:45.769 --> 21:47.410
And dirty talk.

21:47.852 --> 21:49.895
How zis woman even can compare

21:49.973 --> 21:52.138
with a beautiful creation like mine?

21:52.292 --> 21:54.301
Or even with my sister.

21:56.592 --> 21:57.820
To find...

21:57.845 --> 22:00.409
a man who likes to make love to anyzing...

22:01.201 --> 22:03.020
we have to go to such a place.

22:40.795 --> 22:42.380
Who's there?

22:53.223 --> 22:54.506
It's you. Come...

22:57.497 --> 22:58.747
Hi Biba.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.488
Sonja!
- Yeah.

23:01.169 --> 23:02.999
Sonja, this is my friend Sacha.

23:05.190 --> 23:06.598
He's new here.

23:08.217 --> 23:09.735
Why don't we show him a good time?

23:25.380 --> 23:27.434
Are you sure it is in
zis part of town, Baron?

23:27.523 --> 23:28.461
Of course.

23:28.486 --> 23:30.551
I remember well from my schooldays.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.937
Just outside.

23:32.171 --> 23:33.901
Can we go in, Baron?

23:34.247 --> 23:36.279
To go in?
To do what?

23:36.497 --> 23:37.524
You filthy zing.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.042
Of course not.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.084
Excuse me, Baron...

23:41.109 --> 23:42.044
Excuse me.

23:42.069 --> 23:43.171
It's all right Otto.

23:43.207 --> 23:44.831
We'll wait outside.

24:18.437 --> 24:20.725
Why have you never come here before?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.040
I work too much.

24:25.759 --> 24:26.963
You like?

24:56.860 --> 24:58.389
It's one of zose doors.

25:00.554 --> 25:01.882
We watch.

25:02.128 --> 25:04.014
Who goes in or out.

25:31.729 --> 25:33.313
Could they be beating someone?

25:33.338 --> 25:34.999
They like strange zings.

25:35.099 --> 25:36.796
<i>Let me go from here...</i>

25:45.776 --> 25:46.858
No!

25:46.903 --> 25:47.651
No!

25:47.807 --> 25:48.767
No!

25:49.729 --> 25:50.577
No!

25:51.147 --> 25:52.185
No!

26:02.686 --> 26:04.226
Two girls...?

26:04.393 --> 26:05.811
One man...?

26:06.145 --> 26:07.831
He must be very powerful.

26:08.932 --> 26:10.472
Look at his head.

26:12.046 --> 26:13.318
That's him.

26:14.055 --> 26:15.684
That's the man we want.

26:15.930 --> 26:17.381
It's okay. Come in.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.940
Let's go and get ze equipment.

26:33.965 --> 26:34.813
And we come back.

26:34.838 --> 26:36.500
And wait for him tonight.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.971
Come, Erik.

26:46.049 --> 26:47.188
Come.

26:48.259 --> 26:49.398
Come.

26:55.465 --> 26:57.820
It's good to see
the children are already in bed.

26:57.898 --> 26:59.930
We've had quite a day at the picnic.

27:01.336 --> 27:03.364
Olga, you've been very overworked.

27:03.702 --> 27:05.209
And you'll be far more than that.

27:05.234 --> 27:07.350
Because now the children
are your entire responsibility

27:07.374 --> 27:09.514
and I think we can do something about it.

27:09.789 --> 27:11.385
Come say goodnight to mother.

27:18.650 --> 27:21.407
Tomorrow morning I'm expecting a visitor.

27:22.156 --> 27:25.784
I would like you to prepare an especially nice breakfast.

27:26.721 --> 27:27.804
For two.

28:49.573 --> 28:50.700
That's him.

28:50.725 --> 28:52.084
There he comes.

28:52.921 --> 28:54.461
But he's not alone.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.247
He is wiz somebody.

28:56.349 --> 28:57.990
He's helping somebody.

28:59.184 --> 29:01.037
Somebody who looks very drunk.

29:03.135 --> 29:05.068
You get rid of ze drunk, Von Otto.

29:05.093 --> 29:06.765
Yes, Baron, Yes.

29:07.557 --> 29:09.789
And leave ze Serbian to me.

29:25.573 --> 29:26.656
Get down.

30:17.590 --> 30:19.476
It's just what I wanted.

30:21.162 --> 30:22.479
It's magnificent.

30:22.515 --> 30:24.342
I knew we would find it.

30:24.622 --> 30:25.559
Otto!

30:25.584 --> 30:26.541
Look at it.

30:26.566 --> 30:29.381
Finally we found the right head
wiz ze perfect nasum.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.981
For my male zombie.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.427
Preparation for the operation
are almost complete.

31:51.028 --> 31:53.204
I hardly can wait for ze results.

31:53.427 --> 31:55.180
I feel certain Baron.

31:55.258 --> 31:57.735
That with your meticulous efforts we have...

31:57.903 --> 31:59.264
You have made it.

31:59.291 --> 32:01.121
Everything will be successful.

32:01.623 --> 32:03.967
Soon here in Serbia, in my laboratory...

32:04.324 --> 32:06.601
perfection will become a reality.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.433
Yes, yes. That's right.

32:09.801 --> 32:12.089
Ze true embodiment of servant youz...

32:12.114 --> 32:13.790
will find expression.

32:14.437 --> 32:16.234
My work is a continuation

32:16.301 --> 32:18.265
Of ze unfinished business

32:18.410 --> 32:20.006
of men on earth.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.785
A furzer refinement.

32:23.385 --> 32:25.283
But zis time it must cost a life.

32:25.729 --> 32:28.318
Your hands are miracle workers baron.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.740
This is a threshold, Otto...

32:31.399 --> 32:35.160
of a creation that will replace
ze worn out thrash...

32:35.729 --> 32:39.267
that now populates
and repopulates that planet.

32:41.332 --> 32:44.613
Their loyalty will be to me only.

32:44.948 --> 32:47.761
I will be ze object of their allegiance.

32:50.752 --> 32:52.203
Listen to ze heart.

33:36.997 --> 33:38.214
Come in.

33:47.328 --> 33:49.114
You wanted to see me ma'am?

33:54.890 --> 33:55.973
Yes.

34:04.220 --> 34:07.825
I'm not in the habit of conducting
business in bed young man.

34:08.806 --> 34:10.436
However, this morning when I...

34:10.489 --> 34:13.146
came out of bed I didn't feel
too well, so I went back to it.

34:16.909 --> 34:19.543
We've been discussing you,
my husband and I.

34:20.032 --> 34:24.496
And we think that your behaviour
on our property is disgusting.

34:26.059 --> 34:27.922
You are acting like an animal.

34:28.989 --> 34:32.405
And we are seriously considering
dismissing you.

34:35.630 --> 34:37.293
I just came to say goodbye.

34:37.318 --> 34:38.435
Collect my pay.

34:38.704 --> 34:40.222
I have to be leaving anyway.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.483
Leaving?

34:42.175 --> 34:44.440
Well, it's.. sort of sudden.

34:45.243 --> 34:46.426
You seem to be Ehh...

34:46.451 --> 34:47.922
enjoying yourself...

34:48.121 --> 34:50.109
yesterday afternoon to say the least.

34:50.877 --> 34:51.960
What is it?

34:51.985 --> 34:53.232
Is it that girl I saw you with.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.096
Is that your sweetheart?

34:55.264 --> 34:56.837
No, she's just a nice girl.

34:57.081 --> 34:58.387
Well then, what is it, because

34:58.412 --> 35:00.946
had I known you would be the person
to do me this kind of trouble

35:00.971 --> 35:03.067
I would not be here wasting my time

35:03.092 --> 35:04.339
and trying to

35:04.364 --> 35:06.370
offer you chance to better yourself.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.556
To give a position in this household.

35:08.969 --> 35:10.330
I'm sorry. It's my friend.

35:10.355 --> 35:12.485
Oh, your friends. You've been telling
your friends you were coming up here

35:12.510 --> 35:16.265
so that they've been running their
tasteless little stories about me.

35:16.555 --> 35:20.997
I never thought that these idiots
could interfere with my business.

35:21.481 --> 35:23.791
No, you don't understand.
It happened last night.

35:25.409 --> 35:26.671
I'm listening.

35:27.201 --> 35:30.225
Well, me and my friend... I had been
drinking and we had been walking home.

35:30.884 --> 35:32.848
And somebody hit me
on the back of the neck.

35:33.382 --> 35:36.105
And dragged my friend into the bushes
and cut off his head.

35:37.210 --> 35:38.326
It's a nightmare.

35:38.351 --> 35:40.502
No. It's not a nightmare
because I woke up this morning

35:40.527 --> 35:42.690
and there was my friend.
He had his head cut off.

35:42.864 --> 35:45.030
I had to bury him
by the side of the road.

35:45.108 --> 35:47.027
Why didn't...
didn't they harm you.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.456
I don't know.

35:49.789 --> 35:51.608
That's a very unusual story.

35:52.256 --> 35:54.086
Have you told anyone
you were coming up here.

35:54.533 --> 35:56.196
No.
- well then...

35:56.463 --> 35:57.646
You're perfectly safe here.

35:57.725 --> 35:59.745
There's no one to spy on you.

36:01.241 --> 36:03.551
No one knows what goes on in this house.

36:05.961 --> 36:08.092
Besides, with murderers
lurking around

36:08.117 --> 36:10.715
I'm going to need some kind
of protection.

36:11.976 --> 36:15.369
I'm sure that if you'd been
sober last night you would've...

36:16.295 --> 36:18.003
Helped you friend.
You look...

36:18.662 --> 36:19.934
strong.

36:25.375 --> 36:26.703
You are strong.

36:26.728 --> 36:27.887
Yes ma'am.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.073
And very good looking.

36:35.192 --> 36:36.341
Yes ma'am.

36:40.998 --> 36:42.895
My husband does not love me.

36:43.232 --> 36:44.903
It's a marriage in name only.

36:46.616 --> 36:48.915
For the children.
For the.. property

36:50.332 --> 36:51.638
Yes ma'am.

36:52.059 --> 36:53.811
From time to time I...

36:54.235 --> 36:55.999
I need someone up here.

36:59.302 --> 37:00.630
Very lonely.

37:02.293 --> 37:03.320
So...

37:04.135 --> 37:06.289
happy they did not harm you.

37:06.490 --> 37:08.175
You want me to stop work now?

37:10.238 --> 37:11.566
Yes.

37:37.085 --> 37:38.570
Beautiful.

37:38.827 --> 37:42.766
We were very fortunate
to find such a perfect torso in one piece.

37:44.585 --> 37:45.878
Incision.

37:45.903 --> 37:47.150
It's superb.

37:47.531 --> 37:49.149
No sign of contusion.

37:51.414 --> 37:52.575
Ready?!

37:55.982 --> 37:59.096
I go in to her digestive parts.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.795
Separate...

40:23.597 --> 40:24.869
Spleens.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.036
Kidneys...

40:37.351 --> 40:38.835
Gallbladder...

40:45.841 --> 40:46.957
Liver...

41:41.164 --> 41:42.447
Remarkable.

41:45.764 --> 41:47.628
After what you went through last night.

42:29.494 --> 42:31.849
What would be my other duties
while in the house?

42:34.109 --> 42:36.643
Well, Olga is to have
full care of the children.

42:37.803 --> 42:40.047
So as of tonight,
you can start serving dinner.

42:40.292 --> 42:41.397
Alright.

42:42.647 --> 42:43.573
By the way...

42:43.598 --> 42:47.111
We have in the castle the most
modern available plumbing facilities.

42:48.584 --> 42:50.805
And I want you to take full use of them.

42:51.177 --> 42:52.718
Every single day.

42:54.994 --> 42:56.211
Do you understand?

42:56.278 --> 42:57.316
Yes ma'am.

43:17.208 --> 43:18.324
Otto!

43:21.271 --> 43:22.655
Level the table.

43:30.978 --> 43:32.529
Soon I will give you life.

43:32.554 --> 43:33.656
New life.

43:37.045 --> 43:38.384
Why are you looking at me.

43:38.451 --> 43:40.973
You filthy zing.
Turn around.

43:46.172 --> 43:47.723
My male zombie

43:47.748 --> 43:49.052
is almost created.

43:49.230 --> 43:50.580
I only need ze blood

43:50.837 --> 43:52.065
Maybe tonight

43:53.804 --> 43:56.371
Soon you will give me
ze right children.

43:57.152 --> 43:58.670
Ze children I want.

44:41.795 --> 44:42.889
Otto!

44:43.681 --> 44:44.819
Otto!

44:47.476 --> 44:48.826
Help me down.

45:14.542 --> 45:16.183
To know death, Otto...

45:17.592 --> 45:19.434
you have to fuck life...

45:19.858 --> 45:21.387
in ze gallbladder.

45:32.579 --> 45:34.387
I wonder if your father is home.

45:35.213 --> 45:36.708
Why don't you go and look.

45:41.211 --> 45:42.873
Wanna go to the castle?

46:06.545 --> 46:08.040
I'm glad I finally found you.

46:08.065 --> 46:09.637
I've been looking for you everywhere.

46:09.693 --> 46:11.389
But you know that I am always here.

46:11.414 --> 46:12.576
Well, you're not always here.

46:12.601 --> 46:15.500
You could be at the lab, you could
be outside. You could be many places.

46:16.425 --> 46:17.686
Anyway I found you.

46:17.711 --> 46:19.717
It's what I wanted.
I have to speak with you.

46:19.742 --> 46:20.889
About what?

46:21.033 --> 46:23.254
There will be a new person
working around the castle

46:23.279 --> 46:25.152
and I don't want you to be alarmed.

46:25.177 --> 46:26.469
What do you mean?

46:26.494 --> 46:29.108
Well, you are very busy,
the children are out of school...

46:29.133 --> 46:30.950
Olga is overworked.

46:31.262 --> 46:34.309
So I took it upon myself
to hire a new servant.

46:34.677 --> 46:37.255
But how did you find
so quickly another girl?

46:37.419 --> 46:40.734
It is not a girl.
It is a.. man-servant.

46:41.772 --> 46:43.445
A man?
Why not a girl?

46:43.970 --> 46:45.555
You know girls around here.

46:46.425 --> 46:49.137
They're such trash.
And all they want to do is...

46:49.162 --> 46:52.251
steal my jewelry and put on my clothes.

46:53.776 --> 46:55.428
So I adjust for a man.

46:56.443 --> 46:57.336
Kathrine...

46:57.361 --> 46:58.965
I zought we had an agreement.

46:59.027 --> 47:02.275
That no man is working in ze castle,
disturbing my work.

47:02.769 --> 47:04.376
He won't be disturbing you.

47:04.995 --> 47:06.691
I've seen him work.

47:07.182 --> 47:09.202
And I'll keep him very busy.

47:09.894 --> 47:11.010
I hope so.

47:11.223 --> 47:12.518
You can be sure of it.

47:31.358 --> 47:32.753
Where is your husband?

47:34.026 --> 47:36.425
He's busy working.
He works very hard.

47:37.328 --> 47:38.734
He's a very intelligent man.

47:38.998 --> 47:40.493
You can meet him tonight at dinner.

47:41.732 --> 47:43.428
Does he mind you being with men?

47:43.550 --> 47:44.969
I mean, he could get me
in a lot of trouble.

47:44.994 --> 47:46.084
Have me arrested.

47:46.502 --> 47:47.707
Why should he?

47:48.120 --> 47:50.531
He has his work
and I have my privacy.

47:51.278 --> 47:52.952
We have two children.

47:53.109 --> 47:56.022
You.. saw the children
the first time we met.

47:58.416 --> 48:00.012
Did you find them beautiful?

48:01.352 --> 48:02.457
Yeah.

48:02.982 --> 48:05.649
It's the only reason
my husband and I are together.

48:07.493 --> 48:09.289
To bring them up right.

48:25.131 --> 48:26.783
No one has come as close as I.

48:26.914 --> 48:29.292
Understanding the secret of life.

48:29.426 --> 48:31.078
Intelligently created.

48:31.413 --> 48:32.786
My mistakes have been few.

48:32.811 --> 48:34.571
But I learned from everyone.

48:41.520 --> 48:43.786
Let us make certain that ze electrodes

48:43.811 --> 48:46.063
are placed precise as always.

48:46.732 --> 48:48.920
At ze critical energy point.

48:49.827 --> 48:50.965
Apply electricity.

48:50.990 --> 48:52.092
Yes Baron.

48:56.657 --> 48:57.896
Now, start by hand.

48:57.921 --> 48:59.313
I'll handle the brain area.

49:13.548 --> 49:14.988
They move Otto.

49:15.177 --> 49:16.450
Stop ze electricity.

49:16.475 --> 49:17.577
Yes...

49:18.180 --> 49:19.441
And let him down.

49:30.639 --> 49:32.626
Otto, what we're seeing in front of us...

49:32.982 --> 49:34.110
Is really incredible.

49:34.135 --> 49:35.292
It is Baron!

49:35.571 --> 49:37.022
Let's see if they can move.

49:39.522 --> 49:40.739
Arm.

49:50.685 --> 49:51.968
Arm.

49:58.088 --> 49:59.126
Head!

50:02.809 --> 50:03.813
Head!

50:05.485 --> 50:06.824
Look how natural they are.

50:07.438 --> 50:09.480
Look. Their reflex function beautifully.

50:10.522 --> 50:11.817
How super.

50:12.084 --> 50:15.143
Even my own expectations
completely rewarded.

50:15.321 --> 50:16.772
He is so happy for you Baron.

50:16.839 --> 50:18.535
I'm fulfilled.

50:18.749 --> 50:19.943
But not yet.

50:20.088 --> 50:22.298
We have to wait for ze final triumph.

50:22.487 --> 50:24.575
Ze breeding.. and then...

50:24.686 --> 50:25.948
the children.

50:26.084 --> 50:27.858
If there will be only some way

50:28.015 --> 50:29.198
to reduce it,

50:29.223 --> 50:30.626
the gestation period.

50:30.864 --> 50:33.062
How can I wait
for nine months from tonight?

50:33.320 --> 50:35.195
Till she'll bear me ze first child.

50:35.820 --> 50:37.014
I must...

50:37.270 --> 50:39.089
There is even somezings

50:39.216 --> 50:41.146
Science cannot modify.

50:41.370 --> 50:44.004
The honor you do me
to share zis incredible triumph...

50:44.472 --> 50:46.637
is more Zan I deserve Baron.

50:47.447 --> 50:49.299
I take them to table.

51:13.881 --> 51:16.158
Do you approve
of my new servant, Baron?

51:17.843 --> 51:21.080
You are not the only one wiz introductions
to make this evening, my dear.

51:22.423 --> 51:23.327
Otto!

51:23.352 --> 51:24.432
Yes Baron

51:26.753 --> 51:28.751
Show my new guests to ze table.

51:28.896 --> 51:30.123
Yes Baron.

52:30.819 --> 52:32.773
A very handsome pair, Baron.

52:35.383 --> 52:37.805
They're assisting me
in my laboratory work.

52:38.430 --> 52:41.064
They have some interest
in medical problems.

52:42.370 --> 52:43.620
Quite obvious.

52:46.631 --> 52:49.444
Had I known you were so generous
in having couples...

52:49.469 --> 52:52.759
I would not have been so modest
at my own acquisition.

53:11.221 --> 53:12.593
Thank you, Nicholas.

53:25.271 --> 53:26.700
Are you from the town?

53:32.339 --> 53:33.678
I see...

53:36.501 --> 53:38.845
Could they have been
in some kind of accident, Baron?

53:39.024 --> 53:40.084
Not really.

53:46.955 --> 53:48.964
No. I don't want them to eat.

53:49.188 --> 53:51.007
They are not ready yet to eat solid food.

54:06.560 --> 54:07.899
Come here.

54:11.253 --> 54:14.323
There is somezing very intriguing
about your new man, my dear.

54:14.974 --> 54:17.340
Especially to my guests.

54:55.639 --> 54:57.224
What was going on down there?

55:00.270 --> 55:02.480
Do you know these eh...
two new people?

55:04.344 --> 55:05.873
I didn't know that girl.

55:06.297 --> 55:08.161
The man was my friend.

55:08.998 --> 55:10.672
The one that was killed last night.

55:11.085 --> 55:12.993
Well, there you see.
It was a nightmare.

55:13.501 --> 55:15.354
Should've gone and speak to him.

55:15.696 --> 55:16.868
After all...

55:16.893 --> 55:19.156
We're not <i>that</i> strict with our help.

55:24.298 --> 55:25.704
It wasn't...

55:26.763 --> 55:28.248
exactly him.

55:29.527 --> 55:31.112
Well, now you talk nonsense.

55:31.659 --> 55:34.226
How could it be not exactly him
if it is him?

55:34.753 --> 55:37.208
My friend wasn't tall.
He was about my size.

55:38.322 --> 55:39.885
It was my friends head
but it wasn't his body.

55:39.910 --> 55:41.806
You saw how tall
that person was.

55:42.715 --> 55:44.680
Well, he was extremely tall.

55:45.796 --> 55:47.637
What kind of work
did you say husband does?

55:47.793 --> 55:50.360
He's a scholar.
Spends hours in his laboratory.

55:51.052 --> 55:53.173
But I really don't know
what he really does, we...

55:53.198 --> 55:55.126
lead very separate lives.

55:55.997 --> 55:57.704
You must know what he does.

55:58.140 --> 55:59.825
You see him every night at dinner.

55:59.992 --> 56:01.142
Talk to 'em.

56:01.167 --> 56:03.497
A word or a phrase now and then...

56:06.084 --> 56:08.316
Something to do with electrical energy.

56:08.930 --> 56:10.057
But where does he work?

56:10.082 --> 56:12.200
In his laboratory
on the other side of the castle.

56:13.059 --> 56:14.497
No one has access to it.

56:14.522 --> 56:16.953
He had it build seven years ago
with privacy in mind.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.397
Only he and his assistant,

56:19.422 --> 56:22.835
you know, that strange little creature
that's always around him,

56:23.547 --> 56:25.322
are able to go into it.

56:25.672 --> 56:27.089
I should see this laboratory.

56:27.114 --> 56:28.730
It's the only way I'll find out
what happened to my friend.

56:28.755 --> 56:29.846
Mm hm.
You can't go.

56:31.028 --> 56:32.244
No way.

56:32.625 --> 56:33.998
Forget about your friend.

56:34.812 --> 56:36.631
You saw him at the dinner table tonight.

56:36.855 --> 56:38.350
I can't forget about him.

56:38.741 --> 56:40.125
You'll have to.

56:42.069 --> 56:44.848
Besides you can't go wandering
about the castle by yourself.

56:47.314 --> 56:49.323
We have.. better things to do.

01:00:43.118 --> 01:00:46.053
Why, Otto, do they seem so
interested in my wife's new servant.

01:00:46.078 --> 01:00:48.196
He must have some quality
that attracts them.

01:00:48.486 --> 01:00:50.250
He looks familiar to me baron.

01:00:50.275 --> 01:00:52.401
Why shouldn't he.
They all look ze same.

01:00:52.713 --> 01:00:54.621
Except my Serbian.

01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:57.267
He is a true aristocrat of his kind.

01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:59.343
He is unusual, Baron.

01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:02.070
I always look for
ze noble ideals

01:01:02.095 --> 01:01:04.611
and artifacts of ancient
civilizations.

01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:07.884
My sister and I are very much alike.

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:09.369
But she...

01:01:09.394 --> 01:01:12.546
somehow likes to keep her nose
always in ze gutter.

01:01:13.026 --> 01:01:14.410
Jah, jah...

01:02:45.538 --> 01:02:47.480
You see how he's all strapped up?

01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:52.726
And they're gonna blame me for it too.

01:03:04.419 --> 01:03:06.707
You really have to help me
get into the laboratory.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.923
What are you doing
in zis part of ze castle?

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.065
Didn't my wife tell you
never to work around here?

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.193
No she didn't.

01:04:54.218 --> 01:04:56.124
I don't want anybody in zis section.

01:04:56.447 --> 01:04:58.132
If you have ze habit
of doing zings on your own

01:04:58.157 --> 01:05:00.143
you won't have
your job much longer.

01:05:00.606 --> 01:05:02.325
I wasn't planning on keeping it anyway.

01:05:02.426 --> 01:05:04.133
Why? Are you going back
to ze farm?

01:05:04.255 --> 01:05:05.260
Maybe.

01:05:05.285 --> 01:05:07.336
Perhaps that's where you belong.

01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:08.497
Yeah.

01:05:46.608 --> 01:05:47.679
Otto!

01:05:48.661 --> 01:05:49.710
Otto!

01:05:52.213 --> 01:05:54.758
Where are you?!
- Yes Baron.

01:05:57.113 --> 01:05:58.084
Come in.

01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:59.200
What happened?

01:05:59.225 --> 01:06:00.271
I don't know, Baron.

01:06:00.296 --> 01:06:02.704
Did you drop it?
- No, Baron, no.

01:06:04.078 --> 01:06:05.796
It didn't fall by itself.

01:06:05.821 --> 01:06:07.381
I heard no one Baron.

01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:09.457
But I clean it for you immediately.

01:06:17.261 --> 01:06:19.906
I can't go that way.
He saw me and made me go back.

01:06:20.096 --> 01:06:22.049
Is there another way
we can go to get there?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.828
Let's hurry.

01:06:37.131 --> 01:06:39.178
Ze medical profession
would love to claim

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:42.606
<i>my</i> achievement as
part of their own.

01:06:42.738 --> 01:06:45.115
And call it a giant stride forwards

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.477
of medicine.

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:47.928
But they can't.

01:06:48.053 --> 01:06:50.676
It is a giant stride forwards for me!

01:06:51.379 --> 01:06:53.645
Now her beauty will be appreciated.

01:06:58.582 --> 01:06:59.866
Let her down.

01:07:06.228 --> 01:07:07.678
Let him rise too.

01:07:11.311 --> 01:07:14.738
The brain is controlling
zis massive and powerful body.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.360
Never since Adam and Eve...

01:07:17.385 --> 01:07:19.995
history has occurred such a moment

01:07:21.783 --> 01:07:23.368
Watch his eyes.

01:07:23.502 --> 01:07:25.912
When he sees her womanly perfection.

01:07:26.727 --> 01:07:29.774
I'm sure he's never seen anyone
as beautiful as this.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:31.751
Come.

01:07:31.776 --> 01:07:33.447
Bring them close.

01:07:38.132 --> 01:07:39.416
Kiss him.

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:46.347
Kiss him.

01:07:49.555 --> 01:07:50.660
Kiss him!

01:07:53.004 --> 01:07:54.131
Kiss him!

01:07:56.607 --> 01:07:57.790
Kiss him.

01:08:01.926 --> 01:08:03.109
What are you waiting for?

01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:04.347
She's yours!

01:08:04.485 --> 01:08:05.710
Touch her!

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:07.920
Kiss him!

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:13.236
Kiss him!

01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:16.384
Can it be?

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:19.341
Could it be possible that we have failed?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.048
Somebody must have tampered with them.

01:08:22.073 --> 01:08:23.892
Somebody must have been in ze laboratory.

01:08:24.571 --> 01:08:25.854
Kiss him!

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.046
Otto.

01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:32.240
It can't be true.

01:08:32.877 --> 01:08:34.965
Somebody disturbed our work.

01:08:37.633 --> 01:08:39.050
What are you waiting for?

01:08:39.075 --> 01:08:40.188
Kiss him!

01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:45.446
Doesn't work.

01:08:45.546 --> 01:08:46.843
Put them back!

01:08:53.365 --> 01:08:54.671
Get them dressed.

01:08:54.696 --> 01:08:56.314
And ready to leave.

01:09:04.236 --> 01:09:05.240
Wake up.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:06.791
Come on. Wake up!

01:09:06.816 --> 01:09:07.874
What is it?

01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:09.459
What are you doing here?

01:09:09.725 --> 01:09:11.511
I just had a look
at your husbands work.

01:09:11.682 --> 01:09:12.907
What work?

01:09:13.242 --> 01:09:15.247
The laboratory. His butcher shop.

01:09:15.416 --> 01:09:16.810
How did you get there?

01:09:16.836 --> 01:09:17.929
Your children.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.814
They showed me.
They knew the way.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.747
How dare you?

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:25.121
How dare you wake me
up in the middle of the day

01:09:25.145 --> 01:09:26.629
when you know
I have insomnia.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:30.332
How dare you spy
on the Baron's work.

01:09:30.493 --> 01:09:33.250
Since when is the lower class

01:09:33.274 --> 01:09:35.238
allowed such presumption.

01:09:35.928 --> 01:09:37.691
Your husband has
my friend and the girl

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:40.337
in that laboratory of his and
does experiments on them.

01:09:40.738 --> 01:09:43.830
The girl is unconscious and my friend
is so weak he can hardly move.

01:09:44.198 --> 01:09:46.966
The Baron was once a student in medicine

01:09:47.033 --> 01:09:49.812
and perhaps those friends
of yours are sick.

01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:51.587
And in need of help.

01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:53.906
Sometimes when the Baron finds...

01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:56.238
people, that interest him enough...

01:09:56.263 --> 01:09:58.906
and that are sick enough, he treats them.
Like his servant.

01:09:59.107 --> 01:10:01.008
That servant owes his life to him.

01:10:01.076 --> 01:10:01.801
Okay.

01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:04.971
I just came up here to tell you in case
you didn't know and wanted to escape.

01:10:06.209 --> 01:10:07.694
Escape?

01:10:07.884 --> 01:10:09.580
Escape from what?

01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:11.620
This is my life. This is my house.

01:10:11.676 --> 01:10:13.216
I'm not imprisoned.

01:10:13.241 --> 01:10:15.794
Do not interfere with the Baron's work.

01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:21.319
Please do not interfere

01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:23.573
Things that seems strange to you

01:10:23.598 --> 01:10:26.174
are very well planned by the Baron.

01:10:26.408 --> 01:10:27.904
He knows what he's doing.

01:10:28.629 --> 01:10:29.768
So do I.

01:10:29.883 --> 01:10:31.702
And I'm not gonna let it continue.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:34.202
How dare you speak to me this way?

01:10:34.227 --> 01:10:36.134
You're not gonna let what continue?!

01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:38.321
How dare you contradict me?

01:10:38.426 --> 01:10:40.602
Who are you?
You nothing!

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:42.254
You lowlife.

01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:43.616
You scum!

01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:44.788
You bitch!

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:51.466
You Filth! You farmer!

01:10:53.723 --> 01:10:56.614
How dare you walk out on me?

01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:00.475
Somezing went wrong.
- But what?

01:11:00.553 --> 01:11:02.328
Maybe ze mixture of the blood wasn't right

01:11:02.353 --> 01:11:04.566
You were ze only one
who knew about it.

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.349
But maybe someone
got into ze laboratory.

01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:10.179
But Who Baron?

01:11:10.548 --> 01:11:12.330
The Children?
But they wouldn't do it.

01:11:12.967 --> 01:11:14.339
My sister?

01:11:14.473 --> 01:11:17.721
My sister. She always
was very jealous of me. <i>Always!</i>

01:11:18.462 --> 01:11:20.148
But we failed...

01:11:20.192 --> 01:11:22.323
that beautiful serbian female.

01:11:22.447 --> 01:11:24.489
Everybody would have jumped.
<i>Everyone!</i>

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.598
But maybe that head of that...

01:11:26.688 --> 01:11:28.685
<i>creature</i> wasn't any good!

01:11:29.138 --> 01:11:30.879
His perfect nose...

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:32.664
His perfect nose!

01:11:32.732 --> 01:11:35.365
He had the perfect brain.
He was the king I wanted.

01:11:35.477 --> 01:11:36.772
<i>And we failed!</i>

01:11:37.521 --> 01:11:38.949
We have to try it again.

01:11:38.974 --> 01:11:40.501
Otto, we have to try it again.

01:11:40.867 --> 01:11:42.976
I'm going to prove that we can do it.

01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:44.424
We wait for so long.

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.406
You must help me Erik.

01:11:51.257 --> 01:11:52.842
Somebody's spying on me.

01:11:53.344 --> 01:11:56.313
Somebody gets into ze laboratory,
talking to my experiments.

01:11:56.637 --> 01:11:58.344
I don't like that.

01:11:59.074 --> 01:12:01.184
You know anybody who
could to ze laboratory?

01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:02.848
Take anyzing away from there?

01:12:04.275 --> 01:12:05.280
No.

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:07.858
But tell me about ze new servant of mozer.

01:12:08.027 --> 01:12:10.047
Could he go in there
and take zings away?

01:12:10.072 --> 01:12:11.185
No.

01:12:11.253 --> 01:12:13.663
But Erik, someone must get in there
and take zings away.

01:12:13.688 --> 01:12:15.115
Zings are missing.

01:12:15.315 --> 01:12:16.610
You must help me.

01:12:16.684 --> 01:12:18.604
PLease Erik. Promise that you'll help me.

01:12:18.637 --> 01:12:20.736
It's so important to me.

01:13:31.855 --> 01:13:33.216
I know it's you.

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.973
But I don't know how
he could have done this.

01:13:37.054 --> 01:13:38.427
It's all my fault.

01:13:38.618 --> 01:13:41.018
If I hadn't taken you to that house
and gotten drunk,

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.455
I could have helped you.

01:13:45.781 --> 01:13:47.109
He's crazy.

01:13:47.355 --> 01:13:49.085
My experiments are disturbed!

01:13:49.185 --> 01:13:51.573
And you were ze only one
who knew somezing about it.

01:13:51.953 --> 01:13:54.542
And I zought
you were only interrested in sex!

01:13:55.628 --> 01:13:58.529
Don't zink I don't know what's going on
between you and that servant.

01:13:58.965 --> 01:14:00.661
I <i>watched</i> you!

01:14:01.809 --> 01:14:03.594
Up to fathers old tricks?

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.056
Shut up!

01:14:05.123 --> 01:14:06.887
You're a sex maniac.

01:14:07.678 --> 01:14:09.263
Have you been into ze laboratory?

01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:15.070
Why shall I tell you anything?

01:14:15.095 --> 01:14:17.302
Because I did everyzing for you.

01:14:17.368 --> 01:14:19.466
I gave you everyzing
you ever asked me for.

01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:22.458
I never interfered
in your dirty sexlife.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.378
Or your friend, did I?

01:14:25.542 --> 01:14:27.796
If I should tell you something,
what will you do for me?

01:14:28.555 --> 01:14:29.581
Now.

01:14:29.671 --> 01:14:30.821
What do you want?

01:14:31.256 --> 01:14:34.147
There is something very interesting
in your worklab.

01:14:35.015 --> 01:14:35.997
What?

01:14:37.202 --> 01:14:38.229
Your new guest.

01:14:39.914 --> 01:14:41.220
Does he respond only to you?

01:14:41.245 --> 01:14:42.291
Yes.

01:14:42.844 --> 01:14:43.859
Would he to me?

01:14:44.417 --> 01:14:45.913
Only if I tell him.

01:14:46.225 --> 01:14:46.951
Then...

01:14:46.976 --> 01:14:49.184
You tell him that I want
to see him up here.

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:50.879
Alone.

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:53.977
Tell me what you know.

01:14:58.051 --> 01:14:59.825
My servant is a friend of his.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.834
And right now

01:15:01.859 --> 01:15:03.643
he's probably in
your laboratory.

01:15:09.101 --> 01:15:10.909
I know where the rest of your body is.

01:15:11.701 --> 01:15:13.018
I buried it myself.

01:15:13.364 --> 01:15:15.847
We'll come back here with a gun
and make them put you together.

01:15:15.872 --> 01:15:16.863
No.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.330
I don't care.

01:15:20.178 --> 01:15:21.428
It doesn't matter.

01:15:21.484 --> 01:15:22.722
Maybe it'll be alright.

01:15:22.747 --> 01:15:24.073
It's still your brain.

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:28.102
Not really.

01:15:28.549 --> 01:15:30.245
I never could figure you out.

01:15:30.479 --> 01:15:32.332
Breathing is better that not breathing.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.716
No.

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.635
I want to be dead.

01:15:36.487 --> 01:15:37.904
I'm not sure about her.

01:15:39.043 --> 01:15:40.326
But I think it's the same.

01:15:40.351 --> 01:15:41.398
No!

01:15:41.423 --> 01:15:42.915
Now let's go.

01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:45.992
Come.

01:15:49.296 --> 01:15:50.333
If she can leave.

01:15:50.358 --> 01:15:52.331
You can come too.
Come on.

01:16:00.349 --> 01:16:01.465
Where are you going?

01:16:01.611 --> 01:16:03.441
We're leaving
and you're not stopping us.

01:16:03.466 --> 01:16:04.837
You're not going to leave.

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:06.787
They're staying here.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:07.903
And you too.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.448
Take him.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.584
He's not taking anybody.

01:16:13.651 --> 01:16:14.946
He's coming with me.

01:16:14.971 --> 01:16:16.240
<i>Do as I say!</i>

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.315
Make him unconscious.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.648
Do somezing Otto!

01:16:26.007 --> 01:16:27.257
Catch him!

01:16:32.731 --> 01:16:34.048
Get up you fool.

01:16:34.126 --> 01:16:35.298
<i>Go after him!</i>

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.155
You are not leaving here alive.

01:16:43.338 --> 01:16:45.481
You're crazy.
You're not gonna get away with this.

01:16:57.819 --> 01:16:59.248
Make him unconscious.

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:00.832
Biut don't kill him.

01:17:00.956 --> 01:17:02.986
Or damage his head in any way.

01:17:03.377 --> 01:17:05.710
I need his brain for my zombie.

01:17:05.735 --> 01:17:08.380
I'm sure it has
the right instincts we want.

01:17:18.606 --> 01:17:21.140
I'm glad we got rid of that lowlife.

01:17:21.553 --> 01:17:23.327
Certainly made a mistake
about this one.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:25.180
You were happy with him at first.

01:17:25.205 --> 01:17:26.686
Learned my lesson.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:29.012
Ready for a new experience.

01:17:30.172 --> 01:17:31.902
So soon, Katherine

01:17:32.358 --> 01:17:33.317
Yes

01:17:34.065 --> 01:17:35.762
Is your new man available?

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:37.659
Actually he's prepared.

01:17:37.938 --> 01:17:39.221
Come here!

01:17:43.247 --> 01:17:45.490
Have you instructed him to do as I say?

01:17:48.481 --> 01:17:50.278
I'm ready to tell him what I want.

01:17:54.772 --> 01:17:56.480
I hope you'll be very tempered.

01:17:57.071 --> 01:17:58.120
What do you mean?

01:17:58.145 --> 01:17:59.750
His wounds are not healed yet.

01:17:59.872 --> 01:18:01.234
Here! I'll show you.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.341
Touch here.

01:18:05.577 --> 01:18:06.671
And here.

01:18:07.151 --> 01:18:08.691
But not here.

01:18:08.803 --> 01:18:10.499
It's very recent.

01:18:12.957 --> 01:18:14.720
I'll bring him back within two hours.

01:18:16.718 --> 01:18:18.615
I wouldn't say untouched.

01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:22.563
But intact.

01:18:23.322 --> 01:18:25.253
I hope you have some success.

01:18:26.414 --> 01:18:27.954
You go with my sister

01:18:27.979 --> 01:18:29.985
and you do what she demands.

01:18:31.071 --> 01:18:32.913
Is that alright with you?

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:34.754
What you want.

01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:36.105
But Baron.

01:18:36.695 --> 01:18:38.704
Our experiments are too precious

01:18:38.836 --> 01:18:41.369
to leave the laboratory
wizout your supervision.

01:18:41.394 --> 01:18:42.485
Shut up!

01:18:42.541 --> 01:18:43.445
Otto.

01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:44.996
My sister did help me.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.961
And I'm very grateful to her.

01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:49.773
You couldn't provide me
with the information I needed.

01:18:50.944 --> 01:18:53.444
You didn't know
who'd been into ze laboratory.

01:18:53.855 --> 01:18:55.093
Yet she could.

01:18:55.295 --> 01:18:57.527
So what are you whining about?

01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:00.239
My work has been sabotaged
from ze outside.

01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:02.572
And zat too many zings
happened today at my laboratory

01:19:02.893 --> 01:19:06.264
zat I interfere
in my own sisters amusements!

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:08.071
But Baron...

01:19:08.127 --> 01:19:10.448
She will abuse him
or spoil him.

01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:12.446
Do him harm.

01:19:12.471 --> 01:19:13.919
That's enough Otto!

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:17.575
You are very well aware
of my personal habits.

01:19:18.278 --> 01:19:20.432
What is it to him?

01:19:25.173 --> 01:19:26.534
Thank you brother.

01:19:29.581 --> 01:19:31.055
Why are you standing there?

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:32.985
Get me some chemicals.

01:19:33.108 --> 01:19:34.760
As long as the parts are fresh.

01:19:35.162 --> 01:19:36.881
We have to dismember him immediately.

01:19:36.967 --> 01:19:38.664
So he can cause no problems.

01:19:38.999 --> 01:19:40.528
What are you waiting for?

01:19:42.191 --> 01:19:44.412
Okay, I'll do it myself, you fool.

01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:45.316
Come on!

01:19:45.341 --> 01:19:46.467
I'm waiting.

01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:52.753
Tie him up and watch him

01:19:57.106 --> 01:19:58.523
Put her away.

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:00.331
What a day.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.893
Always he tells me what to do.

01:20:32.487 --> 01:20:34.384
Will you do everything I ask?

01:20:35.222 --> 01:20:36.617
What do you want?

01:20:37.639 --> 01:20:39.737
Everything I ask is what I want.

01:21:01.013 --> 01:21:02.486
Come to bed.

01:21:02.776 --> 01:21:04.763
Take your shoes of
and get that thing off.

01:21:21.699 --> 01:21:23.484
Are you going to stay just like that?

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:26.353
Move closer.

01:21:31.906 --> 01:21:33.357
Touch me.

01:21:39.049 --> 01:21:40.410
Not like that.

01:21:43.341 --> 01:21:44.524
Gentle.

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:47.928
There.

01:21:48.676 --> 01:21:49.792
More.

01:21:51.332 --> 01:21:52.527
Lower.

01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.301
Lower.

01:22:02.783 --> 01:22:04.056
Bring your hand up.

01:22:05.953 --> 01:22:07.225
Touch me.

01:22:10.433 --> 01:22:12.129
Hold me close to you.

01:22:16.662 --> 01:22:17.889
Hold me.

01:22:18.782 --> 01:22:19.820
Tighter.

01:22:20.545 --> 01:22:21.862
Squeeze me tight.

01:22:23.864 --> 01:22:25.103
Tighter.

01:22:26.822 --> 01:22:28.295
Hold me close.

01:22:30.315 --> 01:22:31.163
Ooh.

01:22:31.208 --> 01:22:32.168

01:22:32.402 --> 01:22:34.143
Why did you..
Not so.. Close!

01:22:34.168 --> 01:22:35.412

01:22:35.981 --> 01:22:37.622
Stop it. What are you doing?

01:22:38.749 --> 01:22:40.233
I cannot breathe!

01:22:40.546 --> 01:22:41.852
Stop it!

01:22:43.263 --> 01:22:44.368
<i>Stop it!</i>

01:22:47.247 --> 01:22:48.319
Stop...

01:22:53.732 --> 01:22:56.645
The Baron rewarded his sister
for one days loyalty...

01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:59.469
with two hours of company
wiz a mere creature.

01:22:59.904 --> 01:23:01.991
For a whole life of loyalty...

01:23:02.429 --> 01:23:04.427
I take my own reward.

01:23:05.086 --> 01:23:06.637
I have my own rights.

01:23:07.731 --> 01:23:10.030
I had more right to ze girl...

01:23:10.124 --> 01:23:12.032
than the Baronesse's boy!

01:23:13.338 --> 01:23:15.939
Each day The Baron
work into his laboratory...

01:23:16.006 --> 01:23:17.490
I work too.

01:23:17.975 --> 01:23:19.672
I never had pleasure.

01:23:20.553 --> 01:23:23.298
He never finished
medical school, but I...

01:23:24.058 --> 01:23:26.030
I have everyzing
learned in ze field.

01:23:26.055 --> 01:23:27.441
Not out of books.

01:23:28.172 --> 01:23:30.561
And now I know exactly...

01:23:31.353 --> 01:23:32.670
how to do it.

01:23:34.354 --> 01:23:35.683
You wanna watch me?

01:23:37.892 --> 01:23:39.154

01:24:07.801 --> 01:24:09.174
You are so pretty.

01:24:09.856 --> 01:24:11.340
You are so wonderful.

01:24:11.787 --> 01:24:14.555
You are such a
wonderful female creation.

01:24:42.888 --> 01:24:44.875
Now, I'll get into you.

01:24:46.493 --> 01:24:47.911
I have to get in.

01:25:06.385 --> 01:25:07.567
She.. She...

01:25:07.592 --> 01:25:09.409
She's ruined.

01:25:15.592 --> 01:25:17.210
It's not true.

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:18.583
No.

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:20.202
It can't be true

01:25:20.358 --> 01:25:21.999
What are you doing to me?

01:25:23.125 --> 01:25:25.045
You destroyed my female.

01:25:26.025 --> 01:25:27.956
You put your dirty hands on her.

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:29.708
But you went into her, Baron.

01:25:30.199 --> 01:25:31.583
Bastard!

01:25:32.543 --> 01:25:34.204
I studied how to do it.

01:25:34.372 --> 01:25:36.102
I know how to do it!

01:25:36.127 --> 01:25:38.502
You don't!
Wiz your filthy hand.

01:25:39.394 --> 01:25:40.678
Everyzing...

01:25:41.024 --> 01:25:42.240
I cannot put it back.

01:25:42.363 --> 01:25:45.221
All the effort and time
I put in it to create her!

01:25:50.975 --> 01:25:52.047
All her...

01:25:52.072 --> 01:25:53.352
inside is out.

01:25:53.754 --> 01:25:55.183
What do I have to do?

01:25:55.208 --> 01:25:56.544
To find a new female?

01:25:59.090 --> 01:26:00.709
When I took her as a student...

01:26:00.734 --> 01:26:02.170
you knew nozing of medicine.

01:26:02.195 --> 01:26:03.711
I taught you everyzing!

01:26:03.736 --> 01:26:07.367
But zat's happen if you attach people
who know nozing about medicine.

01:26:07.392 --> 01:26:08.896
They are too stupid!

01:26:11.525 --> 01:26:13.087
It's all your fault.

01:26:13.199 --> 01:26:15.130
You had pleasure wiz my wife.
Didn't you?

01:26:15.297 --> 01:26:16.447
I watched you.

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:18.132
You enjoyed yourselves.

01:26:19.784 --> 01:26:21.581
For a peasant boy!

01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:25.094

01:27:36.218 --> 01:27:37.513
You understand?

01:27:38.071 --> 01:27:39.399
He is not your friend.

01:27:39.477 --> 01:27:40.615
I'm your friend.

01:27:40.693 --> 01:27:42.100

01:29:12.653 --> 01:29:14.428
You trouble making bastard.

01:29:32.716 --> 01:29:34.747
You have put an end to my experiments.

01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:37.815
But my work will live on.

01:29:39.636 --> 01:29:41.084
I'm not going to die...

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:42.045
In vain.

01:29:42.802 --> 01:29:44.142
My work is not...

01:29:44.167 --> 01:29:45.358
finished.

01:29:47.562 --> 01:29:49.080
But I know I was...

01:29:49.105 --> 01:29:51.290
working in the right direction.

01:29:52.908 --> 01:29:54.516
I had.. no one.

01:29:54.918 --> 01:29:56.570
Just a laboratory.

01:29:56.759 --> 01:29:58.456
And a dream.

01:29:59.471 --> 01:30:00.922
Ze female is dead.

01:30:01.453 --> 01:30:02.759
But he lives.

01:30:02.784 --> 01:30:04.578
He will.. show the world...

01:30:05.371 --> 01:30:06.688
My genius.

01:30:08.422 --> 01:30:09.795
When they...

01:30:09.984 --> 01:30:11.536

01:30:12.194 --> 01:30:13.455

01:30:14.222 --> 01:30:15.160
riches...

01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:18.371
Perfection.

01:30:21.743 --> 01:30:23.216
I wanted...

01:30:24.098 --> 01:30:25.415

tried...

01:30:45.107 --> 01:30:46.168
My...

01:30:46.193 --> 01:30:47.362
best.

01:31:02.328 --> 01:31:04.392
He won't be giving you
anymore orders now.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:05.977
He got what he deserved.

01:31:06.647 --> 01:31:08.388
Let me down so we can get out of here.

01:31:09.659 --> 01:31:11.210
If I let you down

01:31:11.235 --> 01:31:12.471
what will you do?

01:31:12.773 --> 01:31:15.105
I'll take you out of here.
I'll take you to a real doctor

01:31:15.462 --> 01:31:17.069
Then I cannot let you down.

01:31:18.009 --> 01:31:19.516
I must die here.

01:31:19.717 --> 01:31:21.849
Why? It's okay now.
He's dead.

01:31:22.407 --> 01:31:23.936
I'm more like them than you.

01:31:24.005 --> 01:31:25.284
I belong here.

01:31:25.436 --> 01:31:26.764
That is terrible.

01:31:26.789 --> 01:31:28.416
But there is not life for me.

01:31:28.784 --> 01:31:31.117
What are talking about.
I'm your best friend.

01:31:31.496 --> 01:31:32.858
You know me before...

01:31:33.077 --> 01:31:34.428
But not now.

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.604
I must be dead.
