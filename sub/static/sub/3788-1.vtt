01:35.356 --> 01:36.323
Jessica.

01:36.924 --> 01:38.255
What's going on?

01:42.062 --> 01:43.552
How you doing?

01:44.732 --> 01:47.098
- Love the Caddy.
- Baby, what's up?

01:47.201 --> 01:48.964
- Hi, Turtle.
- You leaving?

01:49.069 --> 01:50.434
- Yeah.
- Damn.

01:52.873 --> 01:54.500
Vince, you need to sign this.

01:54.608 --> 01:57.076
- Not now, Turtle.
- It's for Mary at Nike.

01:57.178 --> 01:59.840
You want her to shut down
our shoe supply?

01:59.947 --> 02:03.110
- I better sign it. After lunch.
- You better sign it.

02:03.217 --> 02:06.948
Don't sign that, Vince. They screwed it up.
They got your eye color wrong.

02:07.054 --> 02:09.852
- It's black and white.
- They look brown to me.

02:09.957 --> 02:11.754
At least they didn't fuck up your package.

02:11.859 --> 02:14.123
What are you talking about?
The poster's a headshot.

02:14.228 --> 02:15.456
I'm just saying, shit happens.

02:15.563 --> 02:19.659
I heard Warren Beatty sent back
300,000 one-sheets for <i>Heaven Can Wait...</i>

02:19.767 --> 02:21.826
'cause his dick looked too small
in sweat pants.

02:21.936 --> 02:24.427
Guy's smart. He looks out for his image.

02:26.106 --> 02:28.233
Incoming. Check this out right here.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.605
Excuse me, did you drop these?

02:31.712 --> 02:34.044
- Turtle.
- Vince. Eric.

02:34.148 --> 02:35.115
How you doing?

02:35.216 --> 02:37.241
You guys going to
that Motorola party tonight?

02:37.351 --> 02:39.319
No, we can't.
We got Vince's premiere tonight.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.650
- We're busy.
- My gosh, that's right.

02:41.789 --> 02:45.316
- Why aren't we on the list?
- 'Cause you're not hot enough.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.327
Good luck. Call us.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.555
- See you.
- Bye.

02:49.663 --> 02:53.030
- How come nobody says hi to me?
- How come you don't say hello to them?

02:53.133 --> 02:57.001
- 'Cause that ain't how it works, asshole.
- Yeah, how does it work?

02:57.304 --> 02:58.293
Fucking models.

02:58.405 --> 03:00.930
If they were any good,
they'd be working in New York.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.373
Speaking of New York,
are we going to that reunion?

03:03.477 --> 03:04.466
Who cares?

03:04.578 --> 03:07.206
The only people I talk to from high school
are right here.

03:07.314 --> 03:11.683
- We gotta go. 10-year reunion, baby.
- We? You weren't even in our class.

03:12.152 --> 03:14.882
- I hung out with a lot of those kids.
- Hang out with them?

03:14.989 --> 03:18.220
You sold them weed in the parking lot,
and you were already, like, 40.

03:18.325 --> 03:20.691
Why don't we meet up with those girls
after the show?

03:20.794 --> 03:22.989
- Yes.
- What are you hooking him up for?

03:23.097 --> 03:24.064
What the fuck?

03:24.164 --> 03:26.564
Poor guy's in recovery,
he needs a night out.

03:26.667 --> 03:29.135
- No, E. Fell off the wagon.
- What are you talking about?

03:29.236 --> 03:32.728
- I know you've been calling Kristen, E.
- No. Is it true?

03:33.207 --> 03:34.868
No, it's not true.

03:35.042 --> 03:36.270
Just say it's over.

03:36.377 --> 03:37.776
- Please.
- It's over.

03:37.878 --> 03:40.039
'Cause we don't want
to tell you she's a bitch...

03:40.147 --> 03:43.913
then two weeks later, you get back together
and you're mad at us for saying it.

03:44.151 --> 03:46.483
- It's over.
- She's a bitch!

03:47.221 --> 03:50.850
- She is a bitch.
- You know what I'm saying?

04:00.401 --> 04:02.733
- How's my head?
- You look fine.

04:03.804 --> 04:06.864
- What are you so worried about?
- It is my movie, too.

04:06.974 --> 04:10.068
- I forgot. Give us your line again.
- All right.

04:12.713 --> 04:14.613
I'm out of here, motherfuckers.

04:16.649 --> 04:19.813
- He nails it every time.
- I love it.

04:20.053 --> 04:22.887
- So the head's good, though, right?
- It's thick, Drama. Thick.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.891
That Rogaine,
that shit's liquid gold, baby. Let's do this.

04:25.993 --> 04:28.860
Johnny, let Vince go out first.

04:29.163 --> 04:31.188
Yeah. Go for it, Vince.

04:50.217 --> 04:54.586
Pavarottis are out tonight, E?
Check out the tits on the girl from <i>Extra.</i>

04:55.322 --> 04:58.485
Go find out where Ali's sitting.
Make sure she's not within 10 rows.

04:58.592 --> 05:01.755
- And don't mug for the cameras, either.
- Come on.

05:09.069 --> 05:11.401
Get a picture of me and my brother.

05:11.939 --> 05:15.170
- You used to be on that show, right?
- I've been on a bunch of shows.

05:15.275 --> 05:19.439
- Vince's brother, what's your name?
- Johnny Chase, he steals the film.

05:21.048 --> 05:23.209
One more, guys.

05:37.031 --> 05:38.123
Nice to see you.

05:38.232 --> 05:40.723
- How're you doing?
- How are you?

05:40.834 --> 05:42.597
- Loved the movie.
- Thank you.

05:48.842 --> 05:50.036
How do you think it went?

05:50.144 --> 05:52.840
- Off the charts. You kidding? They loved it.
- Nice.

05:52.946 --> 05:56.245
- Vince, how are you? Great job.
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

05:56.350 --> 05:59.114
- Can I take a picture with you?
- Yeah, okay.

06:00.988 --> 06:02.888
How long do we have to be at this?

06:02.990 --> 06:05.686
We gotta hang out for a little while,
have a couple drinks, mingle a little bit.

06:05.793 --> 06:07.886
We'll leave in a little while.
Go take that picture with Alan.

06:07.995 --> 06:08.962
Alan who?

06:09.063 --> 06:11.327
Alan, the guy that financed
the fucking movie, Vince.

06:11.432 --> 06:14.959
- The one with the hot daughter?
- No, he's got the gay son. He's over there.

06:15.069 --> 06:17.833
Do it. Let's get a drink,
I'll meet you here in a few minutes.

06:17.938 --> 06:21.567
Every year, after every premiere,
Vince likes to go night swimming.

06:21.842 --> 06:23.241
That was you?

06:35.823 --> 06:36.881
Excuse me.

06:37.224 --> 06:39.658
- Eric.
- Ari. How you doing? What's up?

06:39.760 --> 06:42.627
- What's Vince doing?
- He's over there talking to some people.

06:42.729 --> 06:44.629
Why hasn't he read <i>Matterhorn?</i>

06:44.932 --> 06:47.230
The movie just ended, let him enjoy himself.

06:47.334 --> 06:48.892
No. What does he do all day?

06:49.002 --> 06:49.991
- Today?
- Yeah.

06:50.104 --> 06:51.230
He worked on his short game.

06:51.338 --> 06:54.000
Yeah, he's got one job,
to read fucking scripts.

06:54.108 --> 06:57.043
- He can't do it?
- Go tell him that, he's standing right there.

06:57.144 --> 07:00.341
- What are you talking to me for?
- Tuesday, Courtside, all right?

07:00.447 --> 07:03.541
If you get him to read... Wait for it.

07:04.618 --> 07:06.210
Get him to read <i>Matterhorn,</i> okay?

07:06.320 --> 07:09.255
I will take care of it.
Relax, have fun tonight, will you?

07:09.356 --> 07:11.187
- What does he need?
- What do you need?

07:11.291 --> 07:12.417
I'm on ass patrol.

07:12.526 --> 07:15.051
I got a six-pack, one of them
kind of looks like Kristen.

07:15.162 --> 07:17.722
- What are you, an asshole?
- I'm just saying, revenge fuck.

07:17.831 --> 07:20.664
I'm gonna revenge fuck someone
'cause she looks like my ex?

07:20.767 --> 07:21.995
I would.

07:22.102 --> 07:24.900
More importantly,
this girl told me she loves to give head.

07:25.005 --> 07:28.497
I know you desperately need it,
so I'm gonna make sure she gives it to you.

07:28.609 --> 07:31.476
I'm sure some girl told you
she loves to give head, too, right?

07:31.578 --> 07:33.341
No, I told her I loved Derek Jeter first.

07:33.447 --> 07:35.608
- Then she told me that.
<i>- Legally Blonde,</i> 2 o'clock.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.549
Boy, here she comes.

07:40.687 --> 07:44.384
- Where's Vince? I can't find him anywhere.
- I don't even think he came tonight.

07:44.491 --> 07:47.927
Do not fuck with me, Turtle.
Just tell me where he is.

07:48.262 --> 07:50.730
Are we gonna do this again tonight?

07:51.899 --> 07:53.491
Go fuck yourself, Eric.

07:54.368 --> 07:56.359
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't do anything.

07:56.470 --> 07:58.301
Come on, E. Let's go, these girls are hot.

07:58.405 --> 08:01.033
They won some KROQ premiere contest.
They want to party...

08:01.141 --> 08:03.803
but first they want to meet Vince,
so you gotta hook it up.

08:03.911 --> 08:05.708
Could you get laid without Vince?

08:05.812 --> 08:07.848
Do I give a fuck? That's the answer.

08:41.847 --> 08:43.475
So, you all live here together?

08:43.583 --> 08:47.247
- I live in the guest house.
- I'm a guest. Show me.

08:52.559 --> 08:54.993
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

08:55.362 --> 08:59.196
You just kind of remind me of somebody,
it's freaking me out a little bit.

08:59.299 --> 09:01.767
Come on. You can tell me about her.

09:02.369 --> 09:04.564
Are you really Vince's brother?

09:05.138 --> 09:08.699
- You all don't look very much alike.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

09:09.610 --> 09:11.737
Because I have a lot less body fat.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.511
- Come on, what do I gotta do to get a little?
- Beg.

09:17.184 --> 09:19.311
I'd get on my knees, but I'd drown.

09:19.786 --> 09:23.153
Look, it's not like I don't think you're cute...

09:23.257 --> 09:27.125
but I'm just still hoping
I'm gonna be the one that fucks Vince.

09:27.594 --> 09:30.256
Sweetheart, look around, Vince is gone.

09:30.464 --> 09:32.694
So is your sister and your best friend.

09:32.799 --> 09:37.031
Come on, just make out with me,
I'll show you where Vince eats breakfast.

09:50.517 --> 09:54.248
Morning, Jorge. How you doing?
Watch this shot. Are you ready?

09:54.855 --> 09:56.914
Roberto, sorry about that, buddy.

10:01.328 --> 10:02.761
Morning, Blanca.

10:03.497 --> 10:05.590
- Morning, guys.
- What's up?

10:05.699 --> 10:09.567
- How did it go last night, boy?
- What do you want, a play-by-play?

10:09.670 --> 10:12.366
- I fucked like a puma.
- My girl went nuts, E.

10:12.472 --> 10:14.201
First second, juggling the speed bags...

10:14.308 --> 10:17.243
next, she was telling me
how her uncle used to watch her shower.

10:17.344 --> 10:19.175
- That's great.
- Don't sweat it.

10:19.279 --> 10:21.304
I gave her Vince's jeans. She left thrilled.

10:21.415 --> 10:22.541
What's up, fellas?

10:22.649 --> 10:24.879
Vince, you gotta read this thing.
Ari's going nuts.

10:24.985 --> 10:26.577
I know, he just called.

10:26.687 --> 10:28.552
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.

10:28.755 --> 10:32.282
- I didn't like it.
- Fuck it, then. What do I gotta read it for?

10:32.559 --> 10:34.925
I don't know.
You might see something different.

10:35.028 --> 10:38.691
- You see any parts for me, E?
- I'm not gonna see anything different.

10:38.799 --> 10:41.893
What you like, I like.
I mean, look at last night.

10:42.002 --> 10:46.462
- You liked that and I think we got a hit.
- A hit? We got a monster, Vince.

10:46.573 --> 10:48.768
Yeah, I liked it, but you still read it.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.241
- No.
- You're kidding me, right?

10:51.812 --> 10:55.475
I didn't even know who the killer was
until I saw the fucking thing.

10:56.116 --> 10:59.552
- Unbelievable.
- Call Ari and cancel the meeting.

10:59.653 --> 11:01.780
- What meeting is that?
- Warner's.

11:01.888 --> 11:05.221
- I told him I'd go meet the French director.
- Can I ask you a question?

11:05.325 --> 11:08.351
Why would you agree to a meeting
when you haven't read the script?

11:08.462 --> 11:12.125
Because at the time I agreed,
I still believed I'd read it.

11:12.733 --> 11:14.428
All right, cancel the meeting.

11:14.534 --> 11:17.298
You know what? I'll take the meeting.

11:17.704 --> 11:20.400
It's rude to cancel at the last second.

11:20.774 --> 11:23.607
- What are you gonna talk about?
- I'll listen.

11:23.977 --> 11:27.413
That's what good actors do, they listen.
Right, Johnny?

11:28.281 --> 11:29.305
What?

11:42.529 --> 11:46.260
The guy's a legend, Vince.
Just talk about his old movies, he'll love it.

11:46.366 --> 11:49.267
- What's he done?
- How the fuck would I know?

11:49.369 --> 11:52.600
Vince will love that. He'll love that.

11:53.073 --> 11:54.472
All right, thanks.

11:55.742 --> 11:58.734
That was Black Hack.
Says he's got a dog that'd be perfect for us.

11:58.845 --> 12:00.813
- We're getting a dog?
- A guard dog.

12:00.914 --> 12:03.940
- Sweet.
- Check out the picture, he's beautiful.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.886
He's got a great body, E.
Look at those calves.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.218
This isn't a guard dog,
this is a fucking lawsuit.

12:10.323 --> 12:12.951
- Forget it.
- I was talking to Vince, all right?

12:13.059 --> 12:14.151
This is house business.

12:14.261 --> 12:16.752
You don't live in the house,
so it's not your business.

12:16.863 --> 12:19.058
- Yeah.
- Fuck you guys.

12:19.566 --> 12:22.296
- You did move out on us.
- I live in the guest house.

12:22.402 --> 12:24.632
Which in my mind is still totally fucked up.

12:24.738 --> 12:25.762
Here we go.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.965
You never asked
for the guest house, Johnny.

12:28.074 --> 12:30.099
I shouldn't have to ask. I'm your brother.

12:30.210 --> 12:33.202
Half-brother. Vince thought
you were his cousin till, like, 14.

12:33.313 --> 12:35.941
You know what?
For two years, you guys mooched off me.

12:36.049 --> 12:39.348
- You ate my food, you fucked my fall-out.
- Your what?

12:39.453 --> 12:42.684
My <i>Melrose Place</i> fall-out pussy.
And what's my payback?

12:42.789 --> 12:44.654
Sharing a bathroom with this fat fuck.

12:44.758 --> 12:47.989
Do you need to go at my weight,
you balding, unemployable douche bag?

12:48.094 --> 12:50.187
Johnny, you're family, I need you close.

12:50.297 --> 12:53.630
You'll thank me when Charles Manson
breaks in and slits Eric's throat...

12:53.733 --> 12:55.758
while we're safe with...
What's the dog's name?

12:55.869 --> 12:57.632
- Arnold.
- Arnold?

12:58.271 --> 13:00.239
I like that. Get the dog, Turtle.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.433
Quick decisions. That's why you're a star.

13:02.542 --> 13:04.635
Do what you have to,
but I don't pick up dog shit.

13:04.744 --> 13:05.938
It's the wrecking crew.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.310
Turtle, I hooked you up
with my friend, right?

13:09.082 --> 13:11.414
That shit ain't free,
pay him his fucking money.

13:11.518 --> 13:14.885
- Come on, you know I'm good for it.
- Drama, let's tee up, man.

13:14.988 --> 13:18.355
You know, I'm working on that thing.
But, yeah, I could do it.

13:20.126 --> 13:22.287
Guys, I'll catch you later.

13:35.308 --> 13:36.741
No use beating yourself up over it.

13:36.843 --> 13:39.073
If you didn't like the guy,
you didn't like the guy.

13:39.179 --> 13:41.739
He kept asking me questions,
I didn't know what he wanted.

13:41.848 --> 13:45.079
- French, can't understand a word they say.
- All directors are pricks.

13:45.185 --> 13:47.847
He didn't even see my last two films.
What's that about?

13:47.954 --> 13:49.546
You didn't read his script.

13:49.656 --> 13:52.420
How can you compare
watching a DVD with reading a script?

13:52.526 --> 13:55.962
Vince, don't even worry,
it's probably a dumb movie anyway.

13:56.062 --> 13:58.895
- What's up, Ari?
- I got some feedback from the frog director.

13:58.999 --> 14:00.057
Yeah, listen...

14:00.166 --> 14:01.963
<i>- He loved you.</i>
- Really?

14:02.569 --> 14:05.766
<i>They wanna wrap you up in a scarf</i>
<i>and give you a baguette.</i>

14:06.873 --> 14:09.000
They wanna throw $4 million at you.

14:09.209 --> 14:10.767
You're kidding.

14:10.944 --> 14:12.172
<i>Are you smiling?</i>

14:12.279 --> 14:15.646
- Yeah, I'm smiling.
- Can you hear me smiling? Listen.

14:15.749 --> 14:17.876
<i>You got my balls tingling, man.</i>

14:17.984 --> 14:20.646
They drive that way
in Tiananmen Square, bitch.

14:20.954 --> 14:23.548
<i>- Call me.</i>
- I'll talk to you later, bye.

14:24.691 --> 14:28.354
- They just offered me $4 million.
- Holy shit, are you kidding me?

14:28.461 --> 14:30.156
- Yes!
- Yeah, baby.

14:30.263 --> 14:34.393
- E., what do you think I should do?
- I think you should read the fucking thing.

14:36.903 --> 14:40.134
That's 300 bones plus,
and I hit it off the toe.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.366
Next time aim west.

14:41.474 --> 14:44.238
I don't need Ed Begley
coming here in his electric car again.

14:44.344 --> 14:47.939
That ain't Begley's house.
Pierce Brosnan's got the Spanish roof.

14:48.048 --> 14:50.642
I bet Black Hack
can get us a deal on this G5.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.378
How do you fly on a jet
that your weed dealer handles?

14:53.486 --> 14:56.421
He don't fly the fucking thing.
He knows brokers.

14:56.523 --> 14:58.514
Guys, give it up, all right?

14:58.625 --> 15:02.061
Vince isn't gonna do some dog-shit movie
just so he can time-share a jet.

15:02.162 --> 15:05.063
Who says it's a shit movie?
Sounded like a cool idea to me.

15:05.165 --> 15:08.623
This from a guy who thought <i>Guiding Light</i>
was a cool idea four years ago.

15:08.735 --> 15:11.829
We listen to you, we'd all be working
for some loser on a soap.

15:11.938 --> 15:13.565
I'm up for a soap.

15:15.008 --> 15:16.032
Sorry, Drama.

15:16.142 --> 15:18.201
Vince will be a star no matter what.

15:18.311 --> 15:20.711
It was pre-destined. The kid's a triple-threat.

15:20.814 --> 15:22.873
He's got the look, he's got the talent.

15:22.983 --> 15:24.974
- He's got the head.
- The what?

15:25.085 --> 15:29.044
The head, the big head.
You guys telling me you don't know this?

15:29.189 --> 15:31.214
The bigger the head, the bigger the star.

15:31.324 --> 15:34.555
- You're such an idiot.
- Bruce Willis, big head.

15:34.661 --> 15:38.427
Russell Crowe, big head.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, big head.

15:38.698 --> 15:40.859
Vincent Chase, big, big head.

15:44.070 --> 15:47.062
- How's my head?
- Not so big.

15:47.173 --> 15:50.108
But your ears are huge,
if that helps you out at all.

15:55.582 --> 15:57.743
- Yo.
- I can't get through it, man.

15:57.851 --> 16:00.479
- What's the problem?
- I can't tell if the script sucks...

16:00.587 --> 16:03.215
or if it's just
I got the sound of a jet engine in my head.

16:03.323 --> 16:05.848
- No, Vince, G5's whisper quiet.
- Shut up, Turtle.

16:05.959 --> 16:07.221
Keep reading.

16:08.928 --> 16:12.022
- Give me that thing. Take that.
- You going for Brosnan?

16:12.132 --> 16:14.862
Three bones, baby, three bones.

16:19.406 --> 16:21.340
- You suck.
- I don't know, it's a cop.

16:21.441 --> 16:24.933
- I've never played a cop. Can I play a cop?
- You can play anything, Vince.

16:25.045 --> 16:27.809
Cop's tough. I did four eps of <i>Blue.</i>

16:28.081 --> 16:30.777
The wrong guy could look real stupid
carrying a gun.

16:30.884 --> 16:34.945
- And when were you on <i>NYPD Blue?</i>
- I was on <i>Pacific Blue,</i> cock breath.

16:35.422 --> 16:36.684
And you know that.

16:36.790 --> 16:38.815
For $4 million, we could buy this house.

16:38.925 --> 16:41.120
You only got $2 million for your last movie.

16:41.227 --> 16:43.525
- That's a big bump up.
- What do you think, E?

16:43.697 --> 16:45.790
If they're gonna
give you $4 million for this...

16:45.899 --> 16:48.094
they'll give you $4 million
for something you love.

16:48.201 --> 16:49.293
What the fuck do you know?

16:49.402 --> 16:52.997
Guy does two years at Queens Community,
suddenly he runs this town.

16:53.473 --> 16:55.839
It's Ari. Ari, what's up?

16:55.942 --> 16:57.637
You get a chance to look at <i>Matterhorn?</i>

16:57.744 --> 16:59.939
<i>Yeah, you know what,</i>
<i>I don't really understand it.</i>

17:00.046 --> 17:03.777
- You don't understand? Are you kidding?
- I don't know, it's a little confusing.

17:03.883 --> 17:05.578
This is your artistic bar mitzvah, baby.

17:05.685 --> 17:07.811
You're gonna step up,
you're the man in this one.

17:07.921 --> 17:09.718
- Eric hates it.
<i>- Eric hates it, okay.</i>

17:09.823 --> 17:12.451
He says you should
get me $4 million for something I love.

17:12.559 --> 17:13.719
You're an idiot, dude.

17:13.827 --> 17:16.295
What did you think of the script? Fuck Eric.

17:16.396 --> 17:18.864
- You want to talk to him?
- I don't want to talk to him.

17:18.964 --> 17:20.762
I'm not talking to him. No.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.261
Fucking. Ari, what's up?

17:25.771 --> 17:28.069
<i>Why don't you and I
<i>sit down and have dinner?</i></i>

17:28.174 --> 17:30.836
- Tonight?
- Yeah, we'll sit down over at Koi.

17:30.944 --> 17:34.539
7:30, we'll talk about future plans.
Figure out what's right for us.

17:34.647 --> 17:36.137
Okay, cool.

17:36.716 --> 17:38.616
All right, I'll see you there.

17:39.819 --> 17:43.516
He wants to have dinner with me tonight.
Talk about finding you a new project.

17:43.623 --> 17:46.023
I don't always have to be
in the middle of everything.

17:46.126 --> 17:47.525
You want us to go with him?

17:47.627 --> 17:50.323
What is this, a sweet 16? This is my career.

17:50.430 --> 17:51.863
Let Eric handle it.

17:51.965 --> 17:53.933
Fellas, the puppy's here, baby.

17:56.269 --> 17:59.796
How is this dog gonna protect you?
You can't even get him out of the crate.

17:59.906 --> 18:02.340
Relax. Just gotta bond with him,
learn his language.

18:02.442 --> 18:05.969
Three days, he'll be taking
chicken out of my mouth. Right, baby?

18:08.882 --> 18:11.476
Drama, don't stare at him, retard.

18:12.018 --> 18:13.815
What do you wanna do, Vince?

18:15.755 --> 18:18.087
I kind of want to see this dog in action.

18:19.325 --> 18:21.793
Turtle, I'm guessing you want to go...

18:21.895 --> 18:24.489
to that lingerie party
at the Mansion on Thursday?

18:24.597 --> 18:26.724
Yeah, what do you guys got in mind?

18:35.475 --> 18:37.841
All right, you pansies, let her rip.

18:40.146 --> 18:41.511
Here he comes.

18:42.482 --> 18:45.417
Not the nuts.
I'm saving them for Miss August.

18:55.562 --> 18:57.120
Hang in there, Turtle.

18:59.666 --> 19:02.897
That sake you're drinking,
my wife and I discovered in Hokkaido.

19:03.002 --> 19:04.867
We were visiting Sofia on the set of <i>Lost.</i>

19:04.971 --> 19:09.067
That film didn't really capture the place.
Twice as boring in real life.

19:09.175 --> 19:11.302
How about you, you dating?
What's going on?

19:11.411 --> 19:14.005
I broke up with Kristen.
You know that, right?

19:14.113 --> 19:16.638
The little blonde?
I thought she was the one for you.

19:16.749 --> 19:18.376
Brunette, actually, but, yeah...

19:18.484 --> 19:20.452
I guess she thought
her ex was a better play.

19:20.553 --> 19:24.319
Ask me who I'm fucking.
Come on, who am I fucking?

19:25.258 --> 19:27.692
- Mrs. Ari?
- Please, come on.

19:27.794 --> 19:29.022
Irina Korova.

19:30.363 --> 19:31.830
I don't know who that is.

19:31.931 --> 19:34.764
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue,
she's the cover.

19:34.868 --> 19:36.426
She's that Russian chick.

19:36.536 --> 19:39.471
Yeah, I think Vince hit that.
Did you ask him first?

19:39.572 --> 19:41.267
I'm kidding with you. Relax.

19:42.242 --> 19:43.641
Let me ask you something.

19:43.743 --> 19:45.677
Why are you talking
Vince out of <i>Matterhorn?</i>

19:45.778 --> 19:48.269
- I didn't talk him out of it.
- What is it, the dialogue?

19:48.381 --> 19:51.145
I can get some hack to come in, rewrite it.
No problem, boom.

19:51.251 --> 19:53.811
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- It does matter.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.686
You're part of the team, baby.
I mean, I gotta know what you think...

19:57.790 --> 20:00.384
so I can get you to think
what I think, you know?

20:00.493 --> 20:02.256
Okay, I didn't love it.

20:02.495 --> 20:05.123
It's <i>Die Hard</i> at Disneyland.
What's not to love?

20:05.231 --> 20:08.598
Personally, I don't want to watch
kids blowing up at Disneyland.

20:08.701 --> 20:10.396
Where do you want to watch them blow up?

20:10.503 --> 20:13.529
Nowhere. That's the point.
I just read an article in <i>The Times...</i>

20:13.640 --> 20:16.006
<i>The New York Times,</i>
not this shit they got out here...

20:16.109 --> 20:17.804
- You read <i>The Times?</i>
- Yeah.

20:17.911 --> 20:20.402
- You read <i>The New Republic?</i>
- I've heard of it.

20:20.513 --> 20:23.277
I was reading that.
It's interesting, 'cause what it says...

20:23.383 --> 20:26.580
is that you don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

20:26.886 --> 20:28.820
Look, I thought we were gonna sit here...

20:28.922 --> 20:31.584
and talk about how we could find a project
that Vince loves.

20:31.691 --> 20:33.318
How you and I could work together.

20:33.426 --> 20:36.224
How long you been out here, Eric?
How long?

20:36.729 --> 20:38.128
Fourteen months.

20:38.231 --> 20:40.756
Fourteen months.
And what were you doing back there?

20:40.867 --> 20:42.459
Back on the East Coast?

20:42.702 --> 20:45.432
- Managing an Italian restaurant.
- There you go.

20:45.538 --> 20:49.201
Now, if I was opening a pizzeria,
then you and I could work together.

20:49.309 --> 20:51.675
Eric, I know you mean well.
You're Vince's friend...

20:51.778 --> 20:53.746
you want to protect him
against making a bomb.

20:53.846 --> 20:57.646
Bombs are bad, they kill your career, right?
Wrong. Know what kills your career?

20:57.750 --> 20:59.342
Passing on a hit.

20:59.452 --> 21:03.149
Ari, don't blame me if you can't get
your client to do what you want him to do.

21:03.256 --> 21:04.553
I resent this.

21:04.657 --> 21:07.285
I don't have dinner
with people like you. I don't do it...

21:07.393 --> 21:08.655
I don't do this.

21:08.761 --> 21:10.626
You think Hugh Jackman calls me and says:

21:10.730 --> 21:13.528
"Ari, love the script,
but I gotta run it past my pizza boy"?

21:13.633 --> 21:15.328
I've been doing this for 15 years, okay?

21:15.435 --> 21:17.767
What the hell do you know? Come on.

21:17.870 --> 21:21.499
I know that two years ago you were
the asshole that wouldn't call Vince back.

21:21.607 --> 21:25.373
I also know, Ari, if you ever
fucking talk to me like that again...

21:25.478 --> 21:28.038
I will slap that grin right off your face.

21:28.147 --> 21:31.947
You're gonna get street on me now?
Is that what you're gonna do?

21:32.852 --> 21:35.218
You know what? Enjoy your dinner.

21:35.955 --> 21:37.855
This sake sucks.

21:39.592 --> 21:41.560
Can I get a check, please?

21:56.376 --> 21:59.777
- Fucking scared the shit out me.
- What, were you spanking it?

21:59.879 --> 22:01.904
Yeah, I'm jerking off to <i>Sports Center.</i>

22:02.015 --> 22:04.950
You are. Look, he was tugging it
to the lady golfers.

22:06.119 --> 22:08.519
- Whatever.
- How was your big dinner with Ari?

22:08.621 --> 22:10.646
I'm going to bed. I'll tell you in the morning.

22:10.757 --> 22:12.691
You're not going to bed,
we're going to Vegas.

22:12.792 --> 22:14.885
What are you talking about? We're flying out
for the reunion tomorrow.

22:14.994 --> 22:17.519
No, we're flying from Vegas,
Black Hack got us a jet.

22:17.630 --> 22:18.688
I'm not going to Vegas.

22:18.798 --> 22:21.130
Don't be a pussy.
The Maloofs are hooking us up.

22:21.234 --> 22:23.464
Vince is upstairs right now
emptying out the safe.

22:23.569 --> 22:26.231
Put $10 on red,
and I'll see you guys in New York.

22:26.339 --> 22:30.469
Should we tell him? We should tell him.
Kristen's fucking Vince Vaughn.

22:32.345 --> 22:33.869
What are you talking about?

22:33.980 --> 22:36.813
She's back with what's his face,
the restaurateur.

22:36.916 --> 22:41.182
She was in the middle of 40 Deuce
with her hand down Vince Vaughn's pants.

22:41.287 --> 22:44.620
- She had her hand down his pants?
- Both of them.

22:45.358 --> 22:48.384
Vince Vaughn? That puffy motherfucker.

22:48.494 --> 22:52.328
No, bro. He didn't look puffy at all.
He was looking real good.

22:52.432 --> 22:55.833
Yeah, it was like <i>Swingers</i> Vince Vaughn,
not <i>Old School</i> Vince Vaughn.

22:55.935 --> 22:57.459
It was like new school Vince Vaughn.

22:57.570 --> 23:00.403
He looked like he'd been working out
with a personal trainer...

23:00.506 --> 23:02.371
probably a nutritionist, too.

23:04.343 --> 23:05.401
What?

23:05.511 --> 23:07.775
You're the worst fucking actor
I've ever seen.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.110
- You indicating motherfucker.
- What? What did I do?

23:10.216 --> 23:12.207
- We had him.
- And how is this funny, anyway?

23:12.318 --> 23:14.309
Look, I'm shaking. I feel like I'll throw up.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.115
- You deserve it.
- Yeah, why's that?

23:16.222 --> 23:19.385
You broke the rule:
No girlfriends, no commitments.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.388
Fellas, I need to talk to E.

23:21.494 --> 23:24.122
Please, Vince, talk to the guy,
he's being a little bitch.

23:24.230 --> 23:26.664
Yeah, payback's gonna be a bigger bitch.
You'll see.

23:26.766 --> 23:28.893
Guys, give me a second, all right?

23:29.735 --> 23:33.466
I just talked to Ari.
He said you threatened to beat him up.

23:34.841 --> 23:37.173
Yeah, the guy's a real prick, Vince.

23:38.044 --> 23:39.409
He's my agent.

23:39.512 --> 23:41.912
You can't go around town
threatening people, E.

23:42.014 --> 23:45.347
- We're not back in high school.
- He called me "pizza boy."

23:45.485 --> 23:48.147
What, you were
the night manager at Sbarros, weren't you?

23:48.254 --> 23:51.087
You know what, fuck you, too.
How about that?

23:51.190 --> 23:54.216
Okay, so Ari's an asshole.
What do you want me to do, fire him?

23:54.327 --> 23:55.851
Yeah, that's what I want you to do.

23:55.962 --> 23:58.055
I want you to call him right now
and fire him.

23:58.164 --> 23:59.222
All right.

24:03.536 --> 24:04.560
What are you doing?

24:04.670 --> 24:06.638
Put the phone down, asshole.
What's wrong with you?

24:06.739 --> 24:10.197
- What's wrong with you?
- Look at you, you're ready to fire your agent.

24:10.309 --> 24:14.006
This is your life, your career.
You care about that at all or what?

24:14.113 --> 24:16.604
I care. It's just this shit is hard.

24:16.716 --> 24:20.117
Picking movies, I can't do that. I'm an actor.
Let me act like an actor.

24:20.219 --> 24:22.483
Why don't you act
like you know what the fuck is up?

24:22.588 --> 24:25.614
What are you saying? You want me
to make your decisions for you?

24:25.725 --> 24:28.558
I don't know, I can't decide. Yeah.

24:29.795 --> 24:32.423
Jesus Christ. Do you know where I'd be
if I had your face?

24:32.532 --> 24:34.466
Yeah. Well, you don't.

24:35.701 --> 24:38.261
Look, should I do the movie or not?

24:38.905 --> 24:40.372
You know what I think?

24:40.473 --> 24:43.806
The script's a piece of shit
and I don't think you should do the movie.

24:43.910 --> 24:46.276
Okay. That's that.

24:48.347 --> 24:51.214
I wanted to take some time off
just to chill anyway.

24:51.317 --> 24:55.447
Come on, Vince. Who you kidding?
You've been chilling for three months.

24:55.555 --> 24:59.491
Yeah, but I was all stressed those months.
Now I'm just gonna chill.

25:01.460 --> 25:04.122
- Whatever.
- Come on, we'll talk about it in Vegas.

25:04.230 --> 25:06.562
I'm not going to Vegas.

25:07.366 --> 25:09.425
What do you mean
you're not going to Vegas?

25:09.535 --> 25:12.299
- I'm not gonna go.
- Come on, we'll have a blast.

25:12.405 --> 25:14.202
We got <i>The Real World</i> suite at the Palms.

25:14.307 --> 25:16.935
- No, I'm not gonna go.
- Yeah, me neither.

25:17.043 --> 25:19.341
Those guys were kind of psyched to go,
but fuck it.

25:19.445 --> 25:23.381
- Maybe we'll bag the reunion, too.
- I'm not bagging the reunion.

25:24.217 --> 25:27.914
- You'd go without me?
- Yeah, I'd rather go without you.

25:28.221 --> 25:30.519
- Fuck you.
- I'm not trying to be an asshole...

25:30.623 --> 25:33.353
I'm just saying,
you go and it turns into the Vince show.

25:33.459 --> 25:35.518
I know what's going on.

25:35.928 --> 25:38.362
You're just afraid
I'll fuck that little Asian chick...

25:38.464 --> 25:40.455
you used to chase around.
What was her name?

25:40.566 --> 25:41.965
Sarah Lum.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.735
- I don't care about Sarah Lum.
- Dim Sum Lum.

25:44.837 --> 25:46.304
Don't call her that.

25:46.706 --> 25:48.765
All right, I'll go.

25:49.075 --> 25:52.977
- Your passive-aggressive shit got me.
- All right, we leave for the airport at 3:00.

25:53.079 --> 25:56.412
- And don't even look at Sarah Lum.
- You're just gonna have to tell her.

25:56.515 --> 25:58.107
This is my no-fly zone.

25:58.217 --> 26:00.879
If she enters my airspace,
she's going down.

26:02.955 --> 26:04.354
Your airspace?

26:08.794 --> 26:11.319
Check it out, fellas. Jacket still fits.

26:11.430 --> 26:13.625
Turtle, where did you pack
the Bose headsets?

26:13.733 --> 26:14.791
What Bose headsets?

26:14.900 --> 26:17.425
The ones I told you to pick up
for the flight yesterday.

26:17.536 --> 26:19.731
You didn't tell me
to pick up any Bose headsets.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.933
Yes, I did.
I told you to go to the Bose store...

26:23.042 --> 26:25.237
and pick up four fucking pairs
of Bose headsets.

26:25.344 --> 26:27.403
Vince wants to listen to music
on the flight...

26:27.513 --> 26:30.505
he doesn't want to hear you
jabbering in his ear. Now fucking go.

26:30.616 --> 26:32.607
- Jesus, what got into you?
- Just fucking go!

26:32.718 --> 26:36.484
- Meet us at the airport.
- What a bunch of bullshit.

26:41.594 --> 26:44.620
Headsets? I'm only getting three.

26:44.730 --> 26:47.392
We'll be bumping Biggie,
you'll be humming show tunes.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.798
What was that about?
I don't want any headsets.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.961
The guy thinks I'm the boy
for this sound shit?

26:52.071 --> 26:55.507
You also don't want to be
driving around in a car that has that on it.

27:02.782 --> 27:04.409
That's a good one.

27:07.253 --> 27:09.244
Laugh it up, Drama, you're next.

27:11.624 --> 27:13.489
It's Ari, talk to him.

27:16.562 --> 27:18.621
- Hello?
- Hello, Eric.

27:19.565 --> 27:23.296
- I'd like to talk to Vince.
- Yeah? He'd like you to talk to me.

27:25.838 --> 27:29.330
Okay, player,
tell him Colin Farrell took <i>Matterhorn.</i>

27:29.442 --> 27:30.773
Fuck you!

27:37.350 --> 27:38.908
What did he say?

27:39.151 --> 27:41.449
Colin Farrell's doing <i>Matterhorn.</i>

27:45.491 --> 27:46.788
He's good.

27:48.060 --> 27:51.029
I hope you know
what you're doing, pizza boy.
