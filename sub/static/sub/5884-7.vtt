01:07.647 --> 01:08.780
...Five, six, seven,

01:08.848 --> 01:11.383
eight, nine, 10, 11.

01:11.568 --> 01:12.170
That's two for the Campbells...

01:12.171 --> 01:13.088
Where are these exactly?

01:13.352 --> 01:14.785
It's a movie theater,
no bad seats...

01:15.448 --> 01:16.485
the Cosgroves,

01:17.008 --> 01:19.486
and Joey, Stan, Danny... $10 each.

01:19.662 --> 01:20.417
How come we have to pay

01:20.418 --> 01:22.068
when everyone knows damn
well they were free?

01:22.670 --> 01:23.729
You're such a Jew.

01:25.275 --> 01:26.640
Your friends in Hollywood
know you talk that way?

01:26.796 --> 01:28.545
And let me tell you-
you're the Jew,

01:28.546 --> 01:30.781
trying to make 30 bucks on
something you got for free.

01:31.903 --> 01:33.778
25 on Clay by a knockout.

01:34.142 --> 01:35.383
Liston is favored for a reason.

01:35.719 --> 01:37.976
- Cassius Clay is scared.
- Of what, pray tell?

01:38.520 --> 01:40.333
He had an elevated heart
rate before the last fight.

01:41.156 --> 01:42.263
Who says that means you're scared?

01:42.264 --> 01:44.707
It happens to me all the time.
It runs in my family.

01:45.135 --> 01:47.337
Liston has the weight.
And he's never been knocked out.

01:47.338 --> 01:48.223
Sonny's old.

01:48.691 --> 01:49.798
He's experienced.

01:50.082 --> 01:51.712
Don, I've got your ticket.

01:53.098 --> 01:53.791
You want to put something down?

01:53.792 --> 01:55.326
Stan's got a barber who makes book.

01:55.681 --> 01:56.333
Yeah, who do you like?

01:56.700 --> 01:57.204
I was just saying

01:57.205 --> 01:59.037
I think Clay'd make
one hell of an adman.

01:59.312 --> 02:01.881
You're right. Gimme 100 on Liston.

02:03.932 --> 02:05.781
Joining us for a little
pre-fight steak and cocktails

02:05.782 --> 02:06.492
at the palm?

02:06.878 --> 02:09.801
Absolutely. Samsonite team,
in my office.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.819
Listen, if it comes
up with Jennifer,

02:13.820 --> 02:15.292
I did pay for the seats.

02:16.182 --> 02:18.444
Can you make a dinner
reservation before the bout

02:18.445 --> 02:20.748
for Mr. Sterling and me
anywhere but the palm?

02:21.016 --> 02:22.865
I don't know why everyone
cares so much about it.

02:23.522 --> 02:25.131
If I wanted to see
two negroes fight,

02:25.132 --> 02:26.946
I'd throw a dollar
bill out my window.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.944
I thought we were doing
this at 9:00. It's 11:15.

02:30.158 --> 02:32.426
I'm late, but you're not.
Good work so far.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.884
- Where do you want me?
- Behind the desk is fine.

02:44.596 --> 02:47.562
You're in a white studio,
like in some limbo.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.577
There's two no-name
football players holding

02:50.578 --> 02:52.779
an American tourister and a skyway

02:53.211 --> 02:55.981
going against Mr. Joe Namath

02:55.982 --> 02:58.803
and his defender, a sexy girl

02:58.804 --> 03:01.437
holding a samsonite,
and maybe a referee.

03:01.737 --> 03:04.610
So we hear "hut hut,
hike!" Namath fades back.

03:04.611 --> 03:05.850
"Oh no, it's a blitz!"...

03:09.358 --> 03:11.755
punch in on Namath,
he says something like...

03:12.039 --> 03:13.746
"The secret to victory
on the road is samsonite.

03:13.747 --> 03:15.207
I carry it because it's tough

03:15.633 --> 03:17.963
and no matter what comes at me,
I know I'm protected."

03:21.003 --> 03:21.716
As they fall,

03:22.012 --> 03:24.299
the competitors will bust open,
clothing flying out.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.615
Touchdown, samsonite!

03:25.758 --> 03:27.790
- "I've got it, honey."
- "You sure do, Joe."

03:28.841 --> 03:30.692
"Samsonite... it's tough."

03:35.099 --> 03:36.419
Endorsements are lazy,

03:38.040 --> 03:39.046
and I don't like Joe Namath.

03:39.047 --> 03:40.721
He hasn't even played in
a professional game yet.

03:41.281 --> 03:42.407
He's very handsome.

03:42.947 --> 03:44.409
And women don't buy suitcases.

03:44.739 --> 03:45.861
Dr. faye says they do.

03:47.181 --> 03:48.754
Could you leave us, please?

03:59.064 --> 04:00.806
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment

04:01.300 --> 04:02.579
where you feel free to fail.

04:03.675 --> 04:05.137
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.

04:05.470 --> 04:06.233
Because it works...

04:06.668 --> 04:08.060
"only samsonite is tough."

04:08.495 --> 04:09.907
It's the execution
that's the problem.

04:10.360 --> 04:13.309
- Okay, should it be funny?
- Actually funny?

04:13.310 --> 04:15.574
Maybe. Funny like
what I just saw? No.

04:35.521 --> 04:38.111
- Hello.
- You remembered my birthday.

04:39.516 --> 04:40.717
Did you open my present?

04:41.554 --> 04:43.114
I am. Hold on.

04:51.545 --> 04:52.839
My goodness.

04:53.310 --> 04:55.287
I'm finally doing what I
should've done years ago.

04:56.166 --> 04:58.052
Phillips-Olson- something probably,

04:58.421 --> 05:00.651
but I'll need you.
I want to form an agency

05:00.652 --> 05:03.070
that specializes in
women's products with you

05:03.071 --> 05:04.370
as my creative director.

05:04.923 --> 05:06.114
I don't know what to say.

05:06.632 --> 05:07.762
But you're smiling, right?

05:08.559 --> 05:11.424
I have some very-
sort of a little under the table,

05:11.676 --> 05:14.067
but very high-level talks
with the people at tampax.

05:14.406 --> 05:17.625
Peggy, it's tampax-
50% market share.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.067
I mean they're really up there.

05:19.765 --> 05:20.843
Plus that queer at belle jolie

05:20.844 --> 05:22.089
has been barking up my tree.

05:22.090 --> 05:24.182
Plus I have my
European connections.

05:24.183 --> 05:25.432
It sounds exciting.

05:25.787 --> 05:26.778
The train's leaving
the station, honey.

05:27.085 --> 05:27.868
Get onboard.

05:32.381 --> 05:33.370
Where am I calling you?

05:34.481 --> 05:36.059
I'm in my office at home.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.606
So you already told grey?

05:39.067 --> 05:40.989
I'm not wasting my talents
over there anymore.

05:41.296 --> 05:42.348
Believe me, it was mutual.

05:43.526 --> 05:45.154
Duck, did you lose your job?

05:46.529 --> 05:48.146
Peggy, this is good.

05:48.147 --> 05:49.460
I'm not gonna lie.

05:49.461 --> 05:51.524
I was a little inspired
by what Draper did.

05:52.054 --> 05:53.670
Now I just need some accounts.

05:55.660 --> 05:56.789
It's tough because, well...

05:57.533 --> 05:58.899
it's tough to get a credit line.

06:00.202 --> 06:01.628
So what do you have so far?

06:02.045 --> 06:03.248
I know it's not a diamond necklace,

06:03.249 --> 06:04.813
but I did spend some
money on those cards.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.452
And I appreciate the gesture.

06:08.322 --> 06:09.546
It's just...

06:10.809 --> 06:12.371
I don't know whether
to take this seriously,

06:12.372 --> 06:15.152
because I suspect
you've been drinking.

06:15.837 --> 06:16.754
Well, you're wrong.

06:17.813 --> 06:19.079
I heard about the Clios.

06:19.725 --> 06:20.890
I have to see you tonight.

06:21.802 --> 06:22.841
I have plans.

06:23.326 --> 06:25.133
What, with that Mark?
He's another one.

06:25.611 --> 06:27.646
Duck, you are a
valuable account man.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.385
You have a bright future.

06:29.668 --> 06:31.810
You just need to go to one
of those headhunters and...

06:31.811 --> 06:34.829
- I need to see you, babe.
- Don't do that.

06:35.981 --> 06:38.337
Peg, I'm falling apart.

06:39.643 --> 06:40.702
Don't you know
you're the last thing

06:40.703 --> 06:42.338
that made me feel
good about myself?

06:43.984 --> 06:45.681
Pull your hands out
of your panties.

06:47.069 --> 06:48.998
I can't talk right now....

06:50.638 --> 06:51.952
I want to see you tonight.

06:55.045 --> 06:56.531
You been farting in here?...

06:58.792 --> 06:59.700
I have to go.

07:08.323 --> 07:09.094
We're going to lunch.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.770
I don't know if you could tell,
but he hated it.

07:12.418 --> 07:14.005
I was hating it too
while we were doing it,

07:14.391 --> 07:16.379
but not before. I'm not gonna lie.

07:17.749 --> 07:19.416
So we're back to the drawing board.
Still gotta eat.

07:20.515 --> 07:21.556
Come on, it's your birthday.

07:22.053 --> 07:23.382
We'll let you talk through lunch.

07:26.762 --> 07:27.582
You got a call

07:27.583 --> 07:29.812
while you were in the
toilet to the direct line...

07:29.813 --> 07:31.148
Stephanie from California,

07:31.149 --> 07:33.188
no last name. She says it's urgent.

07:34.752 --> 07:38.551
- Would you like me to place the call?
- No, I've got it.

08:11.071 --> 08:13.365
Bad news. Our night is ruined.

08:14.385 --> 08:15.222
I took care of that.

08:16.326 --> 08:17.710
The kids are going to the palm.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.818
We are going anywhere else.

08:20.819 --> 08:23.237
Well, the brotherhood of
alcoholics anonymous...

08:23.238 --> 08:24.771
Freddy and Cal
Rutledge from Pond's...

08:24.772 --> 08:27.324
will be joining us for
dinner and the fight,

08:27.949 --> 08:28.517
which means we'll have to

08:28.518 --> 08:30.167
drink before dinner if
we want to drink at all.

08:30.584 --> 08:31.930
And then there's all
the talk about drinking

08:32.107 --> 08:33.368
where they start with
the funny stories

08:33.369 --> 08:34.496
and they end up crying.

08:36.695 --> 08:37.426
Again.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.239
15 months I've been
waiting for this fight.

08:40.580 --> 08:44.415
$300. Liston has to
lose by unconsciousness.

08:45.456 --> 08:47.387
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

08:49.097 --> 08:51.919
- I should work on samsonite.
- That's in two weeks.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.971
I'm gonna be in Florida.
Now this is your job too.

08:54.428 --> 08:57.775
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry. You can do that without me.

08:57.776 --> 09:00.219
- Samsonite you can't.
- Are you serious?

09:00.504 --> 09:01.994
We can solve this
problem with a flask.

09:03.741 --> 09:04.972
No, I wouldn't be
good company anyway.

09:05.392 --> 09:06.825
That's never bothered me before.

09:44.008 --> 09:44.769
I don't know what it is,

09:44.770 --> 09:46.620
but I look at the side of your neck

09:46.621 --> 09:48.622
and I wish I had one of
those James Bond pens

09:49.127 --> 09:50.745
so I could jam a dart in it.

09:52.670 --> 09:55.223
James Bond likes to travel.
He goes all over the world.

09:55.630 --> 09:58.412
He goes underwater.
He met a girl underwater.

10:01.379 --> 10:03.071
I think this is a
good place to stop.

10:04.254 --> 10:05.264
See you tomorrow.

10:09.243 --> 10:10.173
Oh, great.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.701
I don't like sitting at my desk

10:12.702 --> 10:14.360
and looking into a garbage dump.

10:14.970 --> 10:17.106
Although I am paid less,
I am still not a janitor.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.642
Thank you, gentlemen.

10:28.847 --> 10:30.127
Doing something special
for your birthday?

10:30.651 --> 10:32.017
Mark is taking me to dinner...

10:32.704 --> 10:34.314
the forum of the twelve caesars.

10:34.670 --> 10:36.277
- Ooh.
- Yes.

10:37.853 --> 10:40.081
- How old are you?
- 26 today.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.916
Well, you're doing all right,
aren't you?

10:48.034 --> 10:49.284
Well, hello.

10:49.771 --> 10:51.990
- Did I hear it's your birthday?
- It is.

10:53.921 --> 10:57.293
- How are you feeling?
- Well, of course my days are

10:57.294 --> 10:59.659
spent sleeping and
visiting the ladies' room,

10:59.878 --> 11:02.011
although it's an incredible feeling

11:02.012 --> 11:03.471
having this baby kick me.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.213
Is it any different
than living with Pete?

11:07.825 --> 11:08.819
You're witty.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.326
I always assumed that,
but it turns out it's true.

11:14.669 --> 11:15.673
Are you going to watch the fight?

11:15.674 --> 11:18.476
Oh, yes. I've been watching boxing

11:18.477 --> 11:19.651
since I was a little girl.

11:20.832 --> 11:22.605
My father loves blood sport.

11:24.410 --> 11:25.627
Mr. Draper's looking for you.

11:27.378 --> 11:28.606
I'm sorry. I have to go.

11:32.057 --> 11:33.008
Happy Birthday.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.624
You know, 26 is still very young.

11:44.098 --> 11:44.845
Have fun.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.126
I want a rare steak
and I want to see

11:49.127 --> 11:50.953
those two men pound each other.

11:51.551 --> 11:53.048
Cynthia's at the restaurant.
We should go.

11:53.497 --> 11:55.035
What about Jennifer?

11:55.331 --> 11:57.200
Oh, don't go in there. Don't do it.

11:59.701 --> 12:02.345
- She's dead.
- Let's beat it before it's us.

12:04.706 --> 12:07.652
- I was just on my way out.
- Did you get California?

12:08.087 --> 12:10.073
Do you want me to
try before I depart?

12:10.573 --> 12:12.162
There's a time difference,
you know.

12:12.163 --> 12:14.498
I do, but it goes the other way.

12:15.638 --> 12:16.754
Good night, Mr. Draper.

12:18.753 --> 12:19.486
Get in here.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.656
Why don't you talk to
Joan and get rid of her?

12:23.166 --> 12:25.362
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed

12:25.363 --> 12:26.946
and made sure that I got it.

12:27.986 --> 12:29.690
So where are we on samsonite?

12:30.102 --> 12:31.396
We'll have something to
show you in the morning.

12:32.132 --> 12:33.297
But the suspense is killing me.

12:34.311 --> 12:36.629
Well, I kind of was on my way out.

12:37.285 --> 12:38.440
Let me just see where we are.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.041
I guess I've got a minute.

13:06.129 --> 13:08.832
Okay. We thought that samsonite is

13:08.833 --> 13:12.085
this very rare element,
this mythical substance,

13:12.086 --> 13:14.004
the hardest on earth-
and we see an adventurer

13:14.005 --> 13:15.482
leaping through a cave.

13:16.190 --> 13:18.066
Is this a substance
much like bullshit?

13:19.925 --> 13:21.452
I thought we could drop
one off the eiffel tower

13:21.453 --> 13:23.593
with a countdown-
like the moonshot...

13:23.835 --> 13:25.164
and show how it doesn't break.

13:25.608 --> 13:28.414
- But it would, wouldn't it?
- Probably.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.255
The government has prohibited us

13:31.256 --> 13:32.319
from doing things like that, Peggy.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.501
They feel that it is not
in the public interest.

13:36.684 --> 13:37.956
We have a thing with samson,

13:38.257 --> 13:40.867
because he's strong... and his hair.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.023
I gave you more responsibility

13:43.024 --> 13:45.012
and you didn't do anything?

13:45.301 --> 13:47.907
That you like.
We did work... a lot.

13:47.908 --> 13:49.100
I don't care if you work 10 seconds

13:49.101 --> 13:50.682
if you bring me something I like.

13:51.272 --> 13:52.373
We're going to do this right now.

13:55.826 --> 13:56.994
Oh, I know you have plans.

13:58.312 --> 14:00.350
You were going to call me
from a bar with an idea?

14:00.351 --> 14:02.200
Do you think elves do this?

14:03.264 --> 14:04.716
You're just gonna change it anyway.

14:05.079 --> 14:06.052
Excuse me?!

14:19.683 --> 14:21.899
- This is Mark Kerney.
- I am so sorry.

14:22.267 --> 14:24.799
I got drawn into his web.
It's gonna be a while.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.802
A while like soon,
or a while like I should cancel?

14:28.431 --> 14:30.314
15 minutes? It shouldn't
take too long.

14:30.315 --> 14:32.707
- He's going to the boxing match.
- He's going to Maine?

14:33.264 --> 14:34.462
You can watch it on
closed-circuit TV

14:34.463 --> 14:36.296
in the movie theaters.
We got tickets.

14:36.732 --> 14:37.876
How come we didn't go?

14:38.329 --> 14:41.294
Because we're having a romantic
dinner for my birthday.

14:41.890 --> 14:43.483
Well, did you tell him that?

14:44.088 --> 14:45.951
Look, I'm the only one who
can help him with this

14:46.000 --> 14:46.935
and the sooner I get off the phone,

14:46.936 --> 14:48.063
the sooner I can come.

14:48.331 --> 14:49.287
Just hurry, will you?

14:51.820 --> 14:53.027
She's gonna be a few minutes late.

14:53.950 --> 14:55.740
A surprise on top of a surprise.

14:56.455 --> 14:57.869
She works too hard.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.052
"The oysters of Hercules,

15:00.053 --> 15:01.730
which you with sword shall carve."

15:02.069 --> 15:04.771
I saw a tray pass by.
They look like hockey pucks.

15:05.241 --> 15:09.146
$1.65. You should
let Gerry get this.

15:09.402 --> 15:11.601
Mom, don't cut the
kid off at the knees.

15:18.214 --> 15:20.816
Now what if an
elephant either sits on

15:20.884 --> 15:22.251
or steps on the suitcase?

15:27.257 --> 15:29.859
How about a slow-moving
airplane runs it over?

15:30.091 --> 15:31.509
Do you like Cassius Clay?

15:33.163 --> 15:35.765
- He's very handsome.
- I don't think so.

15:35.832 --> 15:37.299
You're not supposed to.

15:37.367 --> 15:40.536
I remember my mother talking
about nat king Cole in a way

15:40.604 --> 15:42.438
that made my father throw
out all his records.

15:44.808 --> 15:45.805
He's got a big mouth.

15:47.389 --> 15:50.377
"I'm the greatest."
" Not if you have to say it."

15:52.203 --> 15:53.647
Muhammad Ali.

15:53.784 --> 15:56.152
Do you like the airplane?

15:56.219 --> 15:57.920
Liston just goes
about his business,

15:59.856 --> 16:01.357
works methodically.

16:02.659 --> 16:04.560
Clay will dance and talk,

16:04.628 --> 16:06.462
throw a few until he's wiped out.

16:08.932 --> 16:09.988
A bag under an airplane looks like

16:09.989 --> 16:11.067
there's been an accident.

16:13.036 --> 16:14.777
Three classes of suitcase...

16:15.712 --> 16:18.483
featherweight, middleweight,
heavyweight...

16:19.264 --> 16:20.846
for whatever class you're in.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.482
But how do you do that on TV?

16:24.157 --> 16:26.528
- What's the story?
- You don't like it?

16:27.188 --> 16:30.553
No, I love it. That's great.
That's what we should do.

16:36.993 --> 16:38.127
Let it ring.

16:40.697 --> 16:41.680
I'll say you're not here.

16:42.570 --> 16:44.400
Hello? Oh hello, Roger.

16:44.468 --> 16:46.268
No, he's not here.

16:46.953 --> 16:49.094
I answer other people's
phones all the time.

16:49.748 --> 16:51.576
I'm going to count to three,
then I'm gonna start saying

16:51.577 --> 16:53.140
a lot of words you don't like,
sweetheart.

16:54.479 --> 16:56.751
- This should be good.
- I'm begging you...

16:57.014 --> 16:58.510
Get down here right away.

16:58.722 --> 17:00.316
You think I'd rather be working?

17:00.383 --> 17:01.676
Yeah, I do. Did you know

17:01.677 --> 17:03.886
Freddy Rumsen collects
Indian arrowheads?

17:05.673 --> 17:06.622
Where are you?

17:06.690 --> 17:08.590
There's a bar next to Keenes.

17:08.657 --> 17:10.459
I've been sneaking off
to fortify myself.

17:10.527 --> 17:12.595
Tell 'em you're sick. Go home.

17:12.662 --> 17:14.575
I am sick. I think I overdid it.

17:15.305 --> 17:17.094
And they're self-so-righteous.

17:17.512 --> 17:18.868
I never pissed my pants.

17:19.178 --> 17:21.751
This guy Rutledge killed
a man with a motorboat.

17:22.315 --> 17:23.689
You know what gets you
over something like that?

17:23.690 --> 17:24.626
Drinking.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.517
Still got your ticket.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.707
It's an attractive offer.

17:30.046 --> 17:32.110
Look out your window.
Can you see me?

17:34.527 --> 17:35.569
Good night, sweetheart.

17:39.756 --> 17:41.624
Go ahead. I'll wait.

17:48.899 --> 17:51.941
- Hello.
- 15 minutes? It's almost an hour.

17:52.334 --> 17:54.623
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna leave any minute.

17:55.326 --> 17:56.390
Did you at least have something?

17:56.731 --> 17:58.034
You have to get down here.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.259
You have to get down
here right away.

18:01.912 --> 18:03.779
I can't just leave, okay?

18:03.847 --> 18:06.182
But you have to, okay?

18:06.249 --> 18:08.217
You know what? Just go to my
apartment and wait for me.

18:08.285 --> 18:09.266
We can eat there another time.

18:09.569 --> 18:11.715
No, I don't want to do that.

18:12.422 --> 18:14.517
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Damn it, Peggy.

18:14.518 --> 18:15.494
I've got your whole family here

18:15.495 --> 18:17.236
for a surprise dinner, okay?

18:17.751 --> 18:18.991
And the only way you
can make it worse

18:18.992 --> 18:20.277
is by not coming at all.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.263
Oh, Mark.

18:24.074 --> 18:26.949
I'm so sorry. I'm coming right now.

18:27.486 --> 18:28.387
Thank you.

18:32.394 --> 18:34.298
Well, so much for the surprise.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.051
Okay, I'm going to leave if
that's all right with you.

18:42.118 --> 18:44.053
I'm not so sure about it.

18:44.637 --> 18:45.715
I mean every time we get into this,

18:46.088 --> 18:47.499
we abandon the toughness idea.

18:47.887 --> 18:49.173
Maybe there's something
to the elephant.

18:52.952 --> 18:53.760
Do you want one?

18:57.561 --> 19:00.068
I'm sorry. Do you
have someplace to be?

19:01.755 --> 19:03.882
Maybe tap your foot
so I get the message.

19:04.305 --> 19:06.116
I was supposed to be
at dinner an hour ago.

19:06.209 --> 19:08.196
It's my birthday,
and I'm pretty sure

19:08.197 --> 19:09.162
I ruined everything.

19:09.803 --> 19:11.414
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

19:11.648 --> 19:13.148
Because I thought this
would take a second.

19:13.216 --> 19:14.850
So now I'm supposed
to feel like crap?

19:14.918 --> 19:17.453
Oh, I'm so sick that I
ruined her birthday.

19:18.419 --> 19:20.010
Do you know when my birthday is?

19:20.350 --> 19:22.593
- I was your secretary!
- Well, enjoy your evening!

19:23.823 --> 19:26.654
By the way, you are
20-something years old.

19:26.906 --> 19:28.036
It's time to get over birthdays.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.078
Go ahead. I'll do it myself.

19:51.454 --> 19:53.000
Yes, I'm that important.

19:54.658 --> 19:56.273
So the fact that
you're calling means

19:56.274 --> 19:57.446
that you haven't left yet.

19:57.975 --> 20:00.143
I'm not gonna be able
to make it at all.

20:00.535 --> 20:02.334
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry,

20:02.730 --> 20:04.285
but no one asked you to do this.

20:04.852 --> 20:06.655
You said you never had a surprise.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.576
I can't believe you.

20:09.811 --> 20:10.986
This is your mother speaking.

20:12.111 --> 20:12.983
Hello, ma.

20:13.292 --> 20:14.643
I just want you to know
that we're all here...

20:15.074 --> 20:16.793
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate...

20:17.445 --> 20:19.282
and we're not leaving
until you march in here.

20:19.582 --> 20:22.470
I can't, okay? Could you
put Mark on the phone?

20:23.169 --> 20:24.263
He's crestfallen, you know?

20:24.264 --> 20:27.039
- Mrs. Olson, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

20:28.064 --> 20:29.617
Now he's making excuses for you.

20:29.926 --> 20:31.775
I don't know how many nice boys

20:31.776 --> 20:33.432
you think are lining up for you.

20:34.003 --> 20:36.599
You should be grateful.
Okay, goodbye.

20:39.302 --> 20:41.470
- Hello?
- I'm sorry I ruined this

20:41.538 --> 20:42.586
and I'm sorry you had
to spend the evening

20:42.587 --> 20:43.543
with my mother.

20:43.904 --> 20:45.499
You know what? She's right.

20:45.967 --> 20:47.530
Really? Then why
don't you date her?

20:48.016 --> 20:49.365
She's never even had a job.

20:49.841 --> 20:51.627
How the hell are you mad at me?

20:51.914 --> 20:53.513
Because you used my
birthday to get in good

20:53.514 --> 20:55.647
with a bunch of people
who drive me crazy.

20:55.946 --> 20:57.896
Should I have invited don?
You never stand him up.

20:59.363 --> 21:01.645
What's the point of doing
anything nice for you?

21:02.001 --> 21:03.708
Jesus. You even sound
like my mother.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.693
I'm already into
this place for $40.

21:05.694 --> 21:07.590
If you don't mind,
I'm going to enjoy my dinner

21:07.908 --> 21:09.725
and you enjoy your work.

21:10.266 --> 21:11.705
The fact that you
would stay there...

21:12.577 --> 21:13.623
you know what?

21:15.708 --> 21:18.083
- Forget it.
- No. What?

21:18.528 --> 21:19.872
You want to do this right now?

21:20.176 --> 21:21.800
- Do what?
- Fine.

21:22.371 --> 21:24.600
It's been nice knowing you.
Happy Birthday.

21:26.403 --> 21:29.184
- So that's it?
- Yup. Good night.

21:33.289 --> 21:35.024
Hello?

21:39.353 --> 21:40.786
It'll be fine.

21:41.553 --> 21:43.398
Couples fight. Ask Gerry.

21:56.513 --> 21:58.680
What's wrong? Elevator out?

22:00.443 --> 22:02.070
I think I just broke up with Mark.

22:02.861 --> 22:05.343
Oh. Really?...

22:05.951 --> 22:07.023
I think so.

22:08.675 --> 22:09.601
So go home.

22:10.191 --> 22:12.686
Nope. I'm ready to work.

22:13.148 --> 22:14.396
You win. Again.

22:16.709 --> 22:18.322
You could've just told
me it was your birthday.

22:18.749 --> 22:20.840
Right, and there'd
be no repercussions.

22:21.103 --> 22:23.245
- So now this is my fault?
- Well, it's not my fault

22:23.246 --> 22:25.262
you don't have a family,
friends or anywhere else to go.

22:25.997 --> 22:29.285
Go. Go. Run to him
like in the movies.

22:29.814 --> 22:32.221
- You don't have to be here.
- I do have to be here

22:32.222 --> 22:33.995
because of some
stupid idea from Danny

22:34.244 --> 22:35.716
who you had to hire
because you stole

22:35.717 --> 22:38.205
his other stupid idea
because you were drunk.

22:39.132 --> 22:41.089
Don't get personal because
you didn't do your work.

22:42.625 --> 22:44.346
And by the way,
I know it kills you,

22:44.593 --> 22:47.091
but guess what:
There is no "Danny's idea."

22:47.415 --> 22:49.330
Everything that comes in
here belongs to the agency.

22:49.331 --> 22:50.560
You mean you.

22:51.101 --> 22:54.536
- As long as you still work here.
- Is that a threat?

22:54.604 --> 22:55.618
Because I've already
taken somebody up

22:55.619 --> 22:56.912
on one of those tonight.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.012
- Relax.
- You know what?

22:59.459 --> 23:00.613
Here's a blank piece of paper.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.370
Why don't you turn
that into glo-coat?

23:02.575 --> 23:03.576
Are you out of your mind?

23:04.456 --> 23:05.755
You gave me 20 ideas

23:05.984 --> 23:07.297
and I picked out one of them

23:07.501 --> 23:09.389
that was a kernel that
became that commercial.

23:09.696 --> 23:11.294
- So you remember.
- I do.

23:11.488 --> 23:13.288
It was something about a cowboy.
Congratulations.

23:13.356 --> 23:15.958
No, it was something about
a kid locked in a closet

23:16.025 --> 23:17.076
because his mother
was making him wait

23:17.077 --> 23:18.160
for the floor to dry,

23:18.228 --> 23:19.628
which is basically
the whole commercial.

23:19.696 --> 23:22.331
- It's a kernel.
- Which you changed just enough

23:22.398 --> 23:24.867
- so that it was yours.
- I changed it into a commercial.

23:24.934 --> 23:25.510
What, are we going to shoot him

23:25.511 --> 23:26.875
in the dark in the closet?

23:27.749 --> 23:28.781
That's the way it works.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.500
There are no credits
on commercials.

23:30.853 --> 23:33.506
- But you got the clio!
- It's your job!

23:34.073 --> 23:36.198
I give you money,
you give me ideas.

23:36.388 --> 23:37.707
And you never say thank you.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.237
That's what the money is for!

23:40.306 --> 23:42.621
You're young. You will
get your recognition.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.894
And honestly,
it is absolutely ridiculous

23:45.136 --> 23:48.131
to be two years into your
career and counting your ideas.

23:49.559 --> 23:52.161
Everything to you
is an opportunity.

23:52.602 --> 23:54.223
And you should be
thanking me every morning

23:54.224 --> 23:54.841
when you wake up,

23:54.842 --> 23:57.534
along with Jesus,
for giving you another day!

24:00.103 --> 24:02.304
Oh, come on.

24:05.542 --> 24:08.146
I'm sorry about your
boyfriend, okay?

24:36.577 --> 24:39.746
May 25th. Ideas for samsonite.

24:42.183 --> 24:44.284
Toughness means that......

25:07.441 --> 25:09.209
Peggy, get in here.

25:09.276 --> 25:11.811
- No.
- Come on.

25:11.879 --> 25:13.176
You have to come in here right now.

25:15.827 --> 25:16.883
What do you want?

25:16.951 --> 25:18.785
You have to hear this. Sit down.

25:20.321 --> 25:21.921
Come on. Sit.

25:29.196 --> 25:31.680
So this is tape #4

25:31.681 --> 25:34.372
of "Sterling's gold," by Roger Sterling.

25:38.906 --> 25:40.874
So where was I?

25:42.102 --> 25:44.258
Burt Cooper hated me
and I thought it was

25:44.259 --> 25:46.636
because he thought I'd
be an ally of my father,

25:47.869 --> 25:49.608
but it turned out it
was something to do

25:49.609 --> 25:50.927
with my joie de vivre,

25:51.295 --> 25:52.793
My romantic prowess...

25:53.850 --> 25:55.036
See tape #3...

25:56.147 --> 25:58.985
Including some time with
the queen of perversions,

25:59.403 --> 26:01.449
his secretary Ida Blankenship.

26:01.795 --> 26:05.032
You know what? Don't use her name.

26:06.148 --> 26:09.829
But it was all about him
hating my very youth,

26:11.035 --> 26:13.548
all because the poor
guy had been cut down

26:13.549 --> 26:14.877
in the height of his sexual prime

26:14.878 --> 26:17.166
by an unnecessary orchiectomy.

26:17.711 --> 26:20.480
Lyle Evans, M.D.

26:20.547 --> 26:21.814
I think he had him killed.

26:22.382 --> 26:24.138
Anyway, sometime in
the summer of '48...

26:25.133 --> 26:26.562
No, 1932...

26:28.100 --> 26:30.356
No, 1939.

26:33.327 --> 26:34.897
Why are you laughing?

26:35.696 --> 26:37.263
It's like reading someone's diary.

26:37.331 --> 26:39.599
Come on. Ida was a hellcat?

26:39.667 --> 26:41.801
Cooper lost his balls?

26:41.869 --> 26:43.202
Roger's writing a book?

26:48.876 --> 26:49.957
I should go.

26:50.678 --> 26:52.971
- Stay and visit.
- I've got nothing to say.

26:53.681 --> 26:56.737
- Sure you do.
- No, it's personal.

26:57.084 --> 26:59.056
We have personal conversations.

26:59.453 --> 27:01.750
No, we don't, and I think
you like it that way.

27:01.751 --> 27:03.359
I know I do.

27:05.592 --> 27:06.911
Suit yourself.

27:08.495 --> 27:10.396
We're supposed to be
staring at each other

27:10.464 --> 27:12.544
over candlelight and
he invites my mother?

27:15.235 --> 27:16.309
He doesn't know me.

27:16.937 --> 27:18.389
It's not my fault.

27:21.976 --> 27:23.776
I guess I'm back to square one.

27:25.079 --> 27:25.922
Single.

27:27.348 --> 27:29.549
Well, as Danny would say,

27:29.616 --> 27:31.651
there's no use crying
over fish in the sea.

27:36.156 --> 27:37.795
Mouse!

27:38.831 --> 27:39.784
Over there!

27:44.531 --> 27:46.659
- What are you doing?
- Get the suitcase.

27:47.167 --> 27:50.336
- Why?
- I'm gonna seal it up in my nice samsonite

27:50.404 --> 27:52.572
- and throw it off the roof.
- Don't.

27:52.639 --> 27:54.841
Come on. Every idea you have
is some version of that.

27:54.908 --> 27:58.144
Let's do it.
Where'd you go, Mickey?

27:58.212 --> 28:01.547
- I think it's a rat.
- It's a mouse.

28:01.822 --> 28:03.175
I grew up on a farm.

28:07.654 --> 28:08.486
You know what?

28:09.423 --> 28:11.457
There's a way out of this
room we don't know about.

28:16.730 --> 28:18.064
Are you okay?

28:20.034 --> 28:21.294
I think that's yours.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.482
It's probably Mark.
I don't want to answer it.

28:25.990 --> 28:27.131
It's still your birthday.

28:28.042 --> 28:29.120
Let me get you dinner.

28:34.748 --> 28:36.652
What's the most exciting
thing about a suitcase?

28:39.019 --> 28:40.354
Going somewhere.

28:41.674 --> 28:43.189
The acropolis.

28:44.925 --> 28:45.893
I'd like to go to Greece.

28:46.745 --> 28:48.579
I heard all the good
cooks stayed there.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.459
I'd like to just go on a plane.
I've never been.

28:52.066 --> 28:54.241
- Is that right?
- I've heard about it, obviously.

28:55.135 --> 28:56.646
I've seen it in the movies.

28:57.337 --> 28:58.813
It's an incredible idea... flying.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.827
I remember on the way to Korea

29:01.275 --> 29:03.993
they told us how many thousand
feet in the air we were.

29:05.205 --> 29:06.779
There was some other kid there...

29:07.630 --> 29:09.296
more of a yokel than me, even...

29:09.991 --> 29:12.939
and he screamed,
"man wasn't meant to fly!"

29:18.258 --> 29:20.063
Cooper has no testicles?

29:24.131 --> 29:26.466
Ick. I don't want water.

29:28.655 --> 29:30.733
My uncle Max said he had a suitcase

29:31.134 --> 29:32.310
that was always packed.

29:33.554 --> 29:36.459
He said, "a man has to be
ready to go at any moment."

29:39.079 --> 29:40.474
Jesus. Maybe it's a metaphor.

29:41.048 --> 29:42.748
There's something to that idea.

29:44.651 --> 29:45.616
I don't know.

29:46.553 --> 29:47.378
I can't tell the difference anymore

29:47.379 --> 29:50.511
between something that's good
and something that's awful.

29:52.126 --> 29:53.657
Well, they're very close.

29:55.696 --> 29:57.233
But the best idea always wins

29:58.065 --> 29:59.321
and you'll know it when you see it.

30:00.134 --> 30:02.055
Keep banging your
head against the wall

30:02.603 --> 30:04.403
then it happens.

30:04.940 --> 30:06.109
And then it's done.

30:06.540 --> 30:07.931
Yes, ma'am.

30:10.152 --> 30:11.741
Not like everything
else in my life.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.544
I mean, I know what
I'm supposed to want,

30:15.932 --> 30:18.071
but it just never feels right...

30:19.462 --> 30:21.875
Or as important as
anything in that office.

30:26.204 --> 30:28.505
- I didn't know you were in Korea.
- Very briefly.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.261
Did you shoot anybody?

30:31.865 --> 30:34.050
Nope. I saw some people get killed.

30:35.243 --> 30:36.235
That's memorable.

30:36.303 --> 30:38.500
My father died right
in front of me...

30:39.026 --> 30:41.118
Heart attack. I was 12.

30:41.441 --> 30:44.148
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was pretty violent.

30:44.444 --> 30:45.781
The TV was on.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.179
That's why I hate sports.

30:49.328 --> 30:50.658
Nobody was around...

30:50.851 --> 30:53.286
Saturday afternoon.
My mother was shopping.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.288
I saw my father die too.

30:56.757 --> 30:58.791
He was kicked by a horse....

30:59.960 --> 31:01.527
You're kidding.

31:04.798 --> 31:08.034
- What about your mother?
- I never knew her.

31:12.339 --> 31:14.140
Why is there a dog
in the Parthenon?

31:17.511 --> 31:20.880
That is a roach.
Let's go someplace darker.

31:30.802 --> 31:33.917
I hate dating. I'm terrible at it.

31:34.039 --> 31:36.040
You'll find someone.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.840
You know you're cute as hell.

31:40.545 --> 31:43.751
Men don't exactly stop
and stare in the streets.

31:43.915 --> 31:45.716
Do you want that?

31:46.051 --> 31:48.018
That's not what you
were supposed to say.

31:48.086 --> 31:50.154
What do you care what I think?

31:52.791 --> 31:56.193
Well, everybody thinks
I slept with you

31:56.261 --> 31:57.368
to get the job.

31:58.666 --> 31:59.956
They joke about it,

32:00.509 --> 32:01.999
like it's so funny

32:02.067 --> 32:04.768
because the possibility
was so remote.

32:06.404 --> 32:08.439
It's not because you
aren't attractive.

32:09.874 --> 32:12.476
I have to keep rules about work.

32:13.251 --> 32:14.678
I have to.

32:16.181 --> 32:17.881
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.

32:19.918 --> 32:22.137
Not as attractive as some
of your other secretaries,

32:22.138 --> 32:23.116
I guess.

32:28.445 --> 32:30.387
You don't want to start
giving me morality lessons,

32:30.388 --> 32:31.356
do you?

32:34.266 --> 32:36.066
People do things, right?

32:40.939 --> 32:43.314
My mother thinks you
were responsible,

32:43.315 --> 32:44.690
because you were the only person

32:44.691 --> 32:46.631
who visited me in the hospital.

32:47.912 --> 32:48.686
Jesus. Really?

32:49.447 --> 32:50.652
She hates you.

32:54.986 --> 32:56.457
Do you know who it was?

32:56.755 --> 32:58.522
Of course I do.

33:01.693 --> 33:02.881
Do you ever think about it?

33:06.031 --> 33:07.243
I try not to...

33:09.734 --> 33:11.605
But then it comes
up out of nowhere.

33:14.706 --> 33:15.994
Playgrounds.

33:22.781 --> 33:24.381
Get up!

33:24.449 --> 33:26.050
Get up!

33:26.117 --> 33:28.986
- Come on! Get up!
- Get up!

33:29.054 --> 33:31.221
- Come on, get up!
- Get up.

33:31.289 --> 33:33.490
- Come on.
- Come on, get up!

33:33.558 --> 33:36.460
Get up! Get up!

33:36.528 --> 33:38.996
- Come on, get up!
- Come on, get up!

33:39.064 --> 33:41.265
Get up! Get up, bum!

33:41.333 --> 33:44.101
- Come on.
- It's a fix.

33:44.169 --> 33:46.294
- The fix is in.
- What happened?

33:46.971 --> 33:49.188
- It's over.
- Already? Who won?

33:49.774 --> 33:53.031
- Clay.
- Don't believe that for a second.

33:53.603 --> 33:55.149
No one goes down like that.

33:55.540 --> 33:56.772
That's what the man just said.

33:59.617 --> 34:01.644
Some fight. I lost 100 bucks
in two minutes.

34:03.254 --> 34:05.846
Let's go back, pack up and go home.

34:10.195 --> 34:11.842
Damn elevator's like a rocket.

34:13.056 --> 34:14.233
I think I'm gonna be sick.

34:27.178 --> 34:28.445
Are you okay?

34:42.726 --> 34:44.121
Do you want any water?

34:46.742 --> 34:47.864
What?

34:49.801 --> 34:52.436
I have toothpaste and a
toothbrush in my desk.

34:56.107 --> 34:57.265
Peggy?...

35:00.578 --> 35:02.607
- Peggy. 
- I'll be right back.

35:06.017 --> 35:06.821
Peggy?

35:11.723 --> 35:12.909
Duck?

35:17.629 --> 35:19.863
What are you doing?

35:19.931 --> 35:21.202
Leaving Draper a little present.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.798
Don't! That's disgusting.

35:23.597 --> 35:24.776
Would you let me concentrate?

35:25.325 --> 35:26.654
This is Roger's office.

35:28.606 --> 35:30.278
Now come one. Pull up your pants.

35:36.188 --> 35:37.422
I'm not going anywhere

35:38.496 --> 35:39.452
without you.

35:41.119 --> 35:43.921
Baby. Baby, I need you so bad.

35:45.990 --> 35:47.672
You wouldn't answer your phone

35:48.807 --> 35:50.820
and your roommate said
you were still at work.

35:52.724 --> 35:54.808
Why didn't you answer
the phone, Peewee?

35:59.922 --> 36:00.685
What's going on?

36:00.839 --> 36:02.840
Just go lay down.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.509
You don't belong in here.

36:05.577 --> 36:08.345
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.

36:10.482 --> 36:12.583
I guess when screwing me
couldn't get you anything,

36:12.650 --> 36:14.084
you had to go back to Draper.

36:14.152 --> 36:15.285
- Duck, let's go.
- No.

36:17.121 --> 36:19.523
That's right. We were in love.

36:21.226 --> 36:23.427
Turns out she's just another whore.

36:24.762 --> 36:25.762
Hey!

36:29.492 --> 36:30.971
Jesus! Would you stop?!

36:37.349 --> 36:39.400
Stop it! You're both drunk!

36:39.677 --> 36:42.613
You know, I killed
17 men at Okinawa.

36:45.383 --> 36:46.478
Uncle.

36:49.254 --> 36:50.930
What the hell is wrong with you?

36:51.222 --> 36:52.890
You still think
you're better than me?

36:57.028 --> 36:58.810
Come on, Peggy. Let's go.

37:32.997 --> 37:35.999
I got rid of him. Are you okay?

37:37.902 --> 37:39.436
Yeah.

37:41.372 --> 37:42.486
Are you?

37:44.509 --> 37:48.192
I, uh... I never thought...

37:48.613 --> 37:50.336
I'm so sorry. I...

37:51.649 --> 37:55.018
you know what? I don't
know why I was with him.

37:55.086 --> 37:57.321
- It was a confusing time.
- Stop.

37:59.190 --> 38:00.958
You don't have to explain.

38:05.797 --> 38:07.312
Can you get me a drink?

38:09.233 --> 38:11.034
How long are you gonna
go on like this?

38:12.670 --> 38:14.371
I have to make a phone call

38:14.439 --> 38:17.040
and I know it's going
to be bad, okay?

38:18.242 --> 38:19.676
Oh.

38:21.079 --> 38:22.212
Do you want to be alone?

38:23.648 --> 38:25.248
Just make me a drink.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.818
Sorry if I embarrassed you.

39:01.886 --> 39:03.353
Shh.

40:53.527 --> 40:56.662
- Hello.
- It's me.

40:57.791 --> 40:59.029
She's gone.

41:02.207 --> 41:03.216
I know.

41:04.079 --> 41:05.781
She wanted you to know.

41:08.518 --> 41:10.286
I'm sorry I didn't call. I was...

41:15.138 --> 41:16.519
did she want to talk to me?

41:17.527 --> 41:19.924
You know, she wasn't really there.

41:26.010 --> 41:27.196
I'm coming out.

41:28.793 --> 41:29.898
I'll make the arrangements.

41:30.226 --> 41:33.830
No need. She left
her body to science.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.391
She said that she wanted to go

41:36.392 --> 41:39.267
to U.C.L.A. Medical
school tuition-free.

41:40.593 --> 41:41.670
Of course she did.

41:47.041 --> 41:48.740
I'm coming out.
I'll take care of the house.

41:49.362 --> 41:51.758
I'd like to stay here
if that's okay with you,

41:52.067 --> 41:53.518
take some time off from school.

41:57.078 --> 41:58.759
Of course. That's fine.

42:00.358 --> 42:02.058
She's in a better place.

42:09.282 --> 42:10.447
That's what they say.

42:13.105 --> 42:16.561
It's late and it's been a long day.

42:18.668 --> 42:19.690
Okay.

42:20.990 --> 42:23.354
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

42:25.181 --> 42:26.233
Stephanie.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.434
What happened?

43:08.144 --> 43:11.018
Somebody very important to me died.

43:16.142 --> 43:17.134
Who?

43:18.907 --> 43:21.188
The only person in the
world who really knew me.

43:30.755 --> 43:32.093
That's not true.

43:39.843 --> 43:40.927
You should go home.

43:43.247 --> 43:44.645
You can come in late.

43:46.082 --> 43:47.030
I'll be fine.

43:49.177 --> 43:50.414
I'm so sorry.

43:56.144 --> 43:56.873
Good night.

44:36.765 --> 44:38.472
Drop and give me 20.

44:39.715 --> 44:40.799
You asshole.

44:41.764 --> 44:43.811
Get to work. It's 10:30, maggot.

44:45.511 --> 44:47.829
- Oh.
- Did you spend the night here?

44:49.102 --> 44:51.004
- Yeah.
- See the fight?

44:51.889 --> 44:52.709
No.

44:53.062 --> 44:55.238
90 seconds of boxing and
three hours of analysis.

44:55.522 --> 44:57.378
- And we still don't know who won.
- Clay won.

44:57.379 --> 44:58.284
Read the paper.

45:05.583 --> 45:06.343
Come in.

45:11.235 --> 45:13.148
You look fresh. Did you go home?

45:13.917 --> 45:16.306
I spruced up. Come over here.

45:19.176 --> 45:20.094
Look at this.

45:27.097 --> 45:28.477
I think you have to know the photo.

45:29.283 --> 45:31.541
It's on the front page of
every paper. It's historic.

45:33.674 --> 45:35.833
How do we know it's the
tourister that got knocked out?

45:36.189 --> 45:38.279
Because the slogan will say so.

45:39.205 --> 45:41.145
How do you put it on TV?
Are they animated?

45:41.987 --> 45:43.543
Why are you shitting on this?

45:45.335 --> 45:46.304
I'm tired.

45:47.845 --> 45:48.608
It's good.

45:50.214 --> 45:51.169
It's very good.

46:11.066 --> 46:13.442
Give it to Joey... No, Stan...

46:14.805 --> 46:16.398
Then go home, shower,

46:16.701 --> 46:18.333
then come back and
give me 10 tag lines.

46:18.412 --> 46:18.941
Okay.

46:24.927 --> 46:25.985
Open or closed?

46:27.028 --> 46:27.867
Open.

46:28.067 --> 46:38.267
