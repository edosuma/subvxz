WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:11.553
Michael designs
the new neighborhood.

00:11.636 --> 00:12.804
Bad Place gets to choose
the four new humans.

00:12.887 --> 00:15.140
The other residents will be Janet babies.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.766
You know,
if we pooled our resources,

00:16.850 --> 00:19.185
we could be done
in two shakes of a lamb's Derek.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.311
Thanks, Derek.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.939
<i>When you fail, the four humans</i>
<i>will be tortured for all eternity.</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.150
<i>But guess who's going to be</i>
<i>doing the torturing?</i>

00:25.233 --> 00:26.526
<i>We built a Michael suit.</i>

00:26.609 --> 00:28.820
I can't do it. It's too scary.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.864
Hi, John. I'm the architect.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.032
Come on in.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.367
<i>The Bad Place</i>
<i>didn't pick the worst people.</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:38.246
They picked the people
who would be the worst for us.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.623
You need to erase my memory and reboot me.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.167
Hi, Chidi. I'm Eleanor.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.668
Come on in.

00:46.129 --> 00:50.091
Wow. Just "wow." It's perfect.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.596
Everything is just perfect.
I am so, so happy!

00:54.679 --> 00:56.139
I'm glad you like it.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.515
It's so quaint.

00:57.599 --> 01:01.478
It feels cozy
but also vibrant and limitless.

01:01.561 --> 01:05.565
I can't believe how utterly,
completely, 100% perfect

01:05.648 --> 01:07.192
-everything is.
-You know, let's keep this moving.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.443
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.028
Here is your new home,

01:10.820 --> 01:13.823
complete with two of your favorite things,
floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and...

01:13.907 --> 01:16.159
Reading lights! I love reading lights.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.327
They're great for reading.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.703
And, oh, check this out.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.540
Um, hold out your hand...
and think about a book.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.965
I can summon philosophy books
like Thor's hammer.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.926
This is literally my number one dream.

01:33.009 --> 01:33.968
Also...

01:34.052 --> 01:34.928
Ow!

01:35.011 --> 01:35.845
That hurt.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.639
Well, I have a lot
to attend to, um...

01:38.389 --> 01:39.599
Welcome to the Good Place, Chidi.

01:39.682 --> 01:40.934
Thank you so much.

01:41.017 --> 01:45.980
Uh, and I'm sorry, this has been
so overwhelming, I forgot your name.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.734
-Eleanor.
-Eleanor. Right.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.195
Sorry. Eleanor. Eleanor. Eleanor.
Now I'll never forget.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.280
Well, ya might!

01:58.743 --> 02:00.995
-Okay, can we not--
- Oh, Eleanor.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.414
You did a brave thing
and I am embracing you.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.333
And I shall not let you go.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.168
And I am also embracing you

02:07.252 --> 02:09.796
because this feels warm
and my hands are cold.

02:09.879 --> 02:11.047
Guys, I'm good!

02:11.131 --> 02:13.716
Honestly, it wasn't
even as bad as I thought.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.010
I mean, who cares
if he doesn't remember my name?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.220
Oof.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.055
I mean, "cool-f."

02:19.681 --> 02:20.932
Good save, bud.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.393
Let's just concentrate
on the next resident,

02:23.476 --> 02:25.645
who gets here in six minutes.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.523
Wait. I need to say something.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.233
I know this seems bleak,

02:30.316 --> 02:34.571
and it feels like we're all doomed,
and therefore humanity is doomed.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.156
You needed to say that?

02:36.239 --> 02:39.576
The point is, I believe
that we're destined to succeed.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.996
There is nothing that the Bad Place
can throw at us that we can't handle.

02:43.079 --> 02:47.208
Because we are an incredible,
inspiring, brilliant group of--

02:47.292 --> 02:50.253
Supercharged D-bag ass-wiping maniacs.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.462
I mean, look at you!

02:52.088 --> 02:57.176
I am so proud of how disgusting
and cruel you all are.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.595
You suck.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.891
You all suck donkey butts.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.936
Tahani, so... so smart and sophisticated.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.814
She was the only one who was able
to talk me out of that goatee.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.816
Well, I lost that battle
with Robert Downey Jr.,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.651
and I'll be damned if I lose it with you.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.029
-Bambadjan, such an unbelievable dingus.
-Thanks.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.240
And Val.
Who's a bigger skid mark than Val?

03:19.324 --> 03:20.491
Maybe your mom.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.245
Classic.

03:24.329 --> 03:28.333
We have Janet,
who can do literally anything.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.794
She made all the other people
in the neighborhood.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.712
Not people.

03:32.795 --> 03:37.091
We have me, who had a momentary setback,
but I'm feeling great now,

03:37.175 --> 03:38.176
and that was a while ago.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.553
Most of you don't even remember it,
probably.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.682
We have Jason, who can...

03:48.478 --> 03:51.773
And marching us into battle,
our fearless leader,

03:51.856 --> 03:56.319
the pride of Phoenix, Arizona,
Eleanor Shellstrop!

03:57.362 --> 04:01.407
Technically, the Pride of Phoenix
is a life-size statue of Alice Cooper

04:01.491 --> 04:03.034
made from cigarette butts.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.452
It's outside City Hall.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.663
But thank you for the kind words.

04:06.746 --> 04:10.458
With this team,
there's no problem we can't solve.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.627
There is no problem we can't create.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.381
And believe me,
we are gonna create some problems.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.801
So let's kick things off
with our official Bad Place song!

04:19.884 --> 04:22.971
<i>1 877 Kars for Kids</i>

04:23.054 --> 04:26.432
<i>K-A-R-S Kars for Kids</i>

04:26.516 --> 04:27.725
Ooh, are we singing?

04:27.809 --> 04:28.893
Shut up, Glenn.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.734
I think you look great.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.904
Professional, serious,
a proper team leader.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.366
Does make me feel authoritative,
like that chick from <i>Law and Order.</i>

04:43.950 --> 04:49.080
"Well, boys, looks like
we've got ourselves an SVU."

04:50.290 --> 04:51.416
I've never seen the show.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.751
-Okay. Who we got next?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.965
Linda? Come on in.

04:59.048 --> 05:04.095
So, you, Linda Johannsen,
are in the Good Place.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.097
That's nice.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.893
I know this can be a little overwhelming,
but you'll get used to it.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.187
Do you have any questions?

05:14.105 --> 05:15.481
Is there a fitness center?

05:15.565 --> 05:16.941
There can be,

05:17.025 --> 05:21.696
plus literally anything else
you could possibly wish for.

05:21.779 --> 05:25.908
Just in case we weren't clear,
this is the Good Place.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.744
A state of eternal happiness.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.121
Paradise.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.165
That's nice.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.584
I like that.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.464
So, the Bad Place sent Simone
to mess with Chidi,

05:39.547 --> 05:40.631
John to mess with Tahani...

05:40.715 --> 05:42.925
Do you think they sent Linda
to mess with Jason?

05:43.009 --> 05:46.387
She's from Norway.
Is Norway, like, the opposite of Florida?

05:46.471 --> 05:48.014
All I know is she's boring.

05:48.097 --> 05:51.309
She makes Neutral Janet
look like Disco Janet.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.604
Disco Janet was around
for a while years ago.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.022
She was great.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.608
I mean, she was a lot, but she was fun.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.986
Actually, that's a good idea.
Let's unload this dead weight.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.446
-Janet?
-Hi, there!

06:03.529 --> 06:05.073
Linda, this is Janet.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.534
If you want anything at all,
Janet can bring it to you. Watch.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.997
Janet, can I have a baby elephant
made of pure light

06:13.081 --> 06:15.708
that tells you true secrets
about the universe?

06:16.375 --> 06:19.253
-Shirley Temple killed JFK.
- See?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.588
Anything you want from Janet?

06:21.756 --> 06:24.801
Can I have... a peppermint?

06:24.884 --> 06:26.052
Sure!

06:29.013 --> 06:30.598
I'm going to go over there now.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.895
Stonehenge was a sex thing.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.320
Brent, come on in.

06:45.446 --> 06:49.158
So, you, Brent Norwalk, are dead.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.911
Really? Well, that blows.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.704
Uh, you know what?
Maybe it's a good thing, actually.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.081
Some journalist was poking around,

06:55.164 --> 06:56.874
calling all these ladies
who used to work for me.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.417
You can't even make a joke these days.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.544
Everything is so PC.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.088
And I was an equal opportunity
offender, okay?

07:02.171 --> 07:03.172
I made jokes about everybody.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.925
And, by the way,
I'm the furthest thing from racist.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.802
My dentist was a black woman.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.012
I just think people need to loosen up.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.681
So, where am I exactly?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.475
The Good Place.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.145
Cool. Good.

07:17.770 --> 07:22.108
So, Brent, I see from your file
you were in the materials business.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.568
Oh, yeah. Big time.

07:23.651 --> 07:27.321
Strings, cords,
vinyl, synthetics, rubber...

07:27.405 --> 07:28.823
We do vulcanized now, so that's huge.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.243
Plus metals. Aluminum, brass, copper.
What else?

07:32.326 --> 07:34.537
-Steel?
-No, not steel.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.746
Steel's a sucker's game.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.457
Polymers, coatings, internals...

07:37.540 --> 07:40.960
You crack open an HVAC, that is all us.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.670
Is there golf here?
There freakin' better be.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.757
Okay, well, why don't you
explore around a bit while I go far away?

07:46.841 --> 07:49.594
And if you need anything,
you can always ask Janet.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.471
-Janet?
-Hi, there! How can I help you?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.347
A secretary. Great.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.767
-Not a secretary.
-Fine. Executive assistant.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.145
Here we go with all the "terms"
we got to learn, right?

07:59.228 --> 08:03.149
Vice President of Helping! Captain Marvel!
You know what I'm saying.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.817
I'm not part of this.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.902
Let me show you around.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.947
Well, Linda must be here for Jason,

08:10.031 --> 08:13.701
because Brent is definitely here
to annoy the fork out of me.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.787
Everyone, you may remember
Matt from Accounting.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.290
The Judge has assigned him to our project.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.250
So, I'll be monitoring
the four new humans.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.754
A modified points system will be applied
to their actions for the next year,

08:24.837 --> 08:26.464
and then we'll know
how much better or worse

08:26.547 --> 08:28.424
their behavior is
than when they were alive.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.093
But no one will be able to see
what's happening in real time.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.887
Good luck saving humanity
from eternal doom!

08:39.101 --> 08:40.645
Okay, forget about
all that stuff.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.189
For this first week, all we need to do

08:43.272 --> 08:45.983
is figure out what the fork is up
with these benches.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.152
So, I made this.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.865
We start them out on this side,
because we're like, "What's your deal?"

08:52.949 --> 08:55.701
And when we feel we have a handle
on who they are,

08:55.785 --> 08:58.371
what makes them tick,
we move them to this side...

08:59.247 --> 09:00.122
Party time!

09:00.206 --> 09:02.917
We already know a lot about Simone, so...

09:04.043 --> 09:04.877
Boom!

09:04.961 --> 09:06.837
See? One down, three to go.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.256
Let's go figure out the others.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.507
We can do this.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.343
On three. "Dead eyes, eat hearts,
can't lose!"

09:13.553 --> 09:16.847
Sorry, old Bad Place rallying cry.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.350
Aww!

09:19.433 --> 09:21.936
Janet, he's walking around again.

09:22.019 --> 09:22.937
Yeah, I see that.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.855
Derek, what are you doing here?

09:24.939 --> 09:26.399
You're supposed to stay at Mindy's.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.777
I can't help it.
I'm just such a proud daddy Derek.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.281
I mean, will you look at all these
beautiful babies that we made?

09:33.364 --> 09:36.701
She made them, dude.
You barely did anything.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.120
Probably just made all the butts.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.246
I did make all the butts.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.164
-I made that butt, I made that butt.
- Mmm, right.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.125
- I made both those butts.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.252
Derek, you have to stay at Mindy's house.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.962
What if one of our new humans sees you

09:48.045 --> 09:50.631
and starts asking questions
about the weirdo in the tux?

09:50.715 --> 09:54.010
Say no more. But before I leave,
can I have a hug

09:54.093 --> 09:56.887
in celebration of everything
that we created?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.764
- Okay.
- Aww!

09:58.848 --> 10:00.975
That feels so...

10:02.101 --> 10:03.185
Derek.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.857
<i>You are all, simply put, good people.</i>

10:07.940 --> 10:10.610
The point of the video
is to make them all confront

10:10.693 --> 10:12.778
what kind of people they were on Earth.

10:12.862 --> 10:18.117
Keep a close eye on our four subjects.
Try to gauge their reactions.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.579
The subtlest glances,
the tiniest flinches...

10:22.830 --> 10:24.707
What about shaking someone by the head?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.375
What does that mean?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.668
Oh, boy.

10:28.544 --> 10:32.006
Hey, Simone. Everything okay?

10:32.089 --> 10:33.674
Yeah. Well, no.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.011
Well, actually, it doesn't matter.
None of this is real.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.513
-Sorry?
-I'm a neuroscientist,

10:39.597 --> 10:41.057
so I get what's going on here.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.976
You know, clearly, I was in
some kind of horrible accident,

10:44.060 --> 10:46.604
I'm on my deathbed, and this entire thing
is just a hallucination

10:46.687 --> 10:49.231
constructed by my damaged brain
as it slowly shuts down.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.232
It's not real.

10:50.316 --> 10:54.445
So, I'm just gonna wander around
until I wake up or die.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.697
See ya later, figments of my imagination.

10:59.617 --> 11:04.038
She's just gonna go get some popcorn
from the... river.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.208
There's a popcorn river.
I'll show you guys later.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.877
Uh, she said keep going without her,
so let's roll it.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.754
Janet, make a popcorn river.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.298
Everyone else,
meet at Mindy's in ten minutes.

11:14.882 --> 11:18.219
Well... we're off to a fantastic start.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.097
I wish I could stay and help,
but this system is so complex

11:21.180 --> 11:24.308
that if I lose concentration
for even one billionth of a second,

11:24.392 --> 11:27.061
the entire neighborhood could collapse
in on itself like a dying star.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.689
Also, Brent wants a BLT.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.942
Simone's reaction is fairly common.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.735
When I worked in the Bad Place,

11:34.819 --> 11:37.446
some people just wouldn't believe it
when they heard they were dead.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.572
How did you convince them?

11:38.656 --> 11:42.076
They'd usually come around
by the third or fourth day of mouth fleas.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.078
Obviously, not an option here.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.163
But if Simone doesn't think this is real,

11:46.247 --> 11:48.290
she definitely won't become
a better person.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.001
Who can convince her
that this actually is the afterlife?

11:51.085 --> 11:53.879
We need someone authoritative
and reassuring

11:53.963 --> 11:56.590
like Nelson Mandela
or Sir Patrick Stewart,

11:56.674 --> 11:59.427
or, really, any of my old
racquetball partners would do.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.719
Oh, I know who it should be.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.055
If you say Blake Bortles,
I'm gonna slap you a lot.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.433
Chidi. I believe everything
Chidi ever tells me

12:05.516 --> 12:07.268
because of his brain and how he looks like

12:07.351 --> 12:09.645
one of those owls
that graduated from college.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.021
Of course!

12:11.105 --> 12:15.317
Time to activate our ethical sleeper agent
and introduce him to Simone.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.527
Uh, I don't know.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.529
Simone isn't struggling
with a philosophy problem.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.657
She's just, you know, like... being silly.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.743
Let's just get her to the welcome party
and I'm sure she'll be fine.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.038
-Eleanor, look what my brain did!

12:29.081 --> 12:30.958
It's not real, and neither are you.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.295
<i>I'm in a coma and none of this is real</i>

12:34.378 --> 12:37.673
Okay, I know this is bad
and we need a new approach,

12:38.424 --> 12:40.676
but she is wearing
the hell out of those foam fingers.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.097
<i>Root-a-toot-toot</i>

12:45.181 --> 12:47.808
Dude, Janet told you to stay at Mindy's.

12:47.892 --> 12:53.272
I know. I just came to mix myself
a Derek and then I'll be on my way.

12:54.064 --> 12:57.234
Before you leave, I wanna call a truce.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.486
All right.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.906
I feel like you're trying
to get under my skin, but it's okay.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.241
I've decided to rise above it.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.160
Well spoken, Mr. Mendoza.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.704
Let me say in response...

13:09.371 --> 13:13.000
I will destroy you.

13:13.584 --> 13:19.673
Janet is and always will be
my mommy-girlfriend.

13:19.757 --> 13:23.135
You have crossed the Rubicon now, pal.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.224
Mmm...

13:28.933 --> 13:30.100
<i>Okay, status report.</i>

13:30.184 --> 13:31.810
What have we learned about Linda?

13:31.894 --> 13:32.853
Little, I'm afraid.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.232
I tried talking to her, but it was
the dullest conversation I have ever had.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.735
And this is coming from someone who
once split a Xanax with Peter Sarsgaard.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.446
Frankly, I'm glad she's boring.
We have enough to worry about.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.449
-How is Brent doing?
-About the same, I'd say.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.367
Princeton.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.953
Graduated in the top half
of the bottom half of my class.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.789
Rowing team, sailing team,
class president,

13:51.872 --> 13:52.957
I hung out with all those guys.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.085
Okay. And John,
our favorite gossip columnist?

13:56.168 --> 13:59.547
Luckily, before I died, I pumped my face
with six vials of Juvederm.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.383
I'm hoping that my corpse
looks like a waxed tile floor.

14:02.466 --> 14:05.094
My ex-boyf is gonna be supes jeal'.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.972
Okay, well, I'm gonna do a loop
trying to see who gets me.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.766
Our biggest liability right now is Simone.

14:10.849 --> 14:14.228
Let's try to keep the three of them
away from her.

14:15.604 --> 14:19.275
We can't wait any longer.
We have to introduce Simone to Chidi.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.944
Why? I think she's doing great.

14:23.654 --> 14:24.655
See?

14:24.738 --> 14:26.615
She's getting all the cake-pushing
out of her system.

14:26.699 --> 14:31.161
I know it's painful to think
of the two of them... connecting.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.123
But Chidi made an incredible sacrifice.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.751
He had his memories erased
so he could help people.

14:37.835 --> 14:41.005
And if we don't let him help Simone,
it'll be all for nothing.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.173
Fine.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.636
Stupid ethical, reasonable argument.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.055
Wish you were a cake. Push you over.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.517
-Are you still muttering?
-No, I stopped.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.937
Stupid, good-hearing, reformed demon.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.523
Whoa!

15:02.484 --> 15:04.278
Hey, there, Simone!

15:04.361 --> 15:06.572
-Shoving people in the pool, huh?
-Yeah.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.617
Just testing the laws of physics
here in my nonsense brain-jail.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.621
-Who's this?
-This is Chidi Anagonye.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.457
He was a professor
of ethics and moral philosophy,

15:16.540 --> 15:18.000
so I figured he might be able to help.

15:18.083 --> 15:22.004
Chidi Anagonye. That sounds so familiar.
Where did you teach?

15:22.087 --> 15:24.340
St. John's University in Sydney.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.383
Of course. I used to teach there.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.344
I must have seen his name
on the faculty list

15:28.427 --> 15:31.847
and now my dying brain
is just leaking out random information.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.309
The human mind is truly incredible.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.896
<i>I want something else</i>

15:38.979 --> 15:41.106
<i>To get me through this</i>

15:41.190 --> 15:43.692
<i>Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby</i>

15:43.776 --> 15:46.153
Sorry... uh, what's happening now?

15:46.236 --> 15:48.364
When I was a kid, my CD alarm clock broke

15:48.447 --> 15:50.199
and it used to wake me up
to that song every day,

15:50.282 --> 15:52.952
so now I'm singing it
to try and wake myself up.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.828
Okay. Well, it was nice meeting you.

15:54.912 --> 15:59.041
Nice to meet you, too, cute guy generated
by my rapidly-decaying temporal lobe.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.422
-Hey--
-You know,

16:05.506 --> 16:08.592
it's bad enough that you guys
have taken over my house for a year

16:08.676 --> 16:10.511
and I've had to move into the attic,

16:10.594 --> 16:12.179
but now I have to walk in to find

16:12.262 --> 16:14.932
Darth Vader's turd
in the middle of my living room.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.266
I mean, what is this?

16:16.350 --> 16:17.768
No time to explain.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.687
Also, I kinda forgot.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.480
Where is Derek's plunger?
The one that kills him?

16:22.606 --> 16:25.317
Yeah, I used to do this
whenever I needed some alone time.

16:25.401 --> 16:29.029
Once, I rebooted him
just because he was breathing super loud.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.032
Then, when he woke up,
he was like, "I don't breathe."

16:32.116 --> 16:33.409
So I don't know what I heard.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.995
Well, I'm doing this because
he's trying to steal my girlfriend.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.080
Yeah. You don't need to justify it.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.165
Again, I do it all the time.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.168
No! Mindy, please wait. Don't kill me.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.086
Oh!

16:44.837 --> 16:47.006
It's you? Okay.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.924
Well, you certainly
don't have the Dereks to--

16:59.810 --> 17:00.936
Yeah!

17:01.645 --> 17:02.479
Oh!

17:02.563 --> 17:03.689
It's always good.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.775
You know what, Simone?
Think of it this way.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.696
If this is really all a hallucination,
doesn't it seem kinda basic?

17:10.779 --> 17:13.574
I mean, surely your brain
would imagine something weirder

17:13.657 --> 17:15.451
than just a nice cocktail party.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.744
You mean like that?

17:16.827 --> 17:19.371
<i>Attention, I have been Derek'd.</i>

17:19.455 --> 17:22.583
That's probably my doctor.
This is all in my head.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.917
I'm gonna go eat a knife.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.587
<i>Attention. Murder has been me.</i>

17:26.670 --> 17:28.088
Let me get this straight.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.841
Derek "made mean eyes at you,"

17:30.924 --> 17:33.677
so you went to Mindy's house
and murdered him?

17:33.761 --> 17:35.971
Yeah, dawg, but his eyes were really mean.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.806
You're probably thinking this...

17:39.600 --> 17:41.018
but they were more like this...

17:42.394 --> 17:44.188
Jason, why did you kill Derek?

17:44.271 --> 17:47.524
I had to get his giant head out of the sky
before any of the humans could see,

17:47.608 --> 17:48.567
and it was not easy.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.153
I was scared Derek was trying
to slide into your DMs.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.863
-I hate being scared. It's scary.

17:52.946 --> 17:53.906
I don't have time for this.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.866
I am running a neighborhood
and its residents,

17:55.949 --> 17:59.036
and Eleanor just casually orders me
to make popcorn rivers

17:59.119 --> 18:02.331
and Brent won't stop calling me for stuff.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.749
Ugh!

18:03.832 --> 18:05.542
Are we still boyfriend/not-a-girlfriend?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.002
We'll talk about it later.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.630
Okay. Executive decision.
Forget about Simone.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.591
Janet, make sure she doesn't come
in contact with the other humans.

18:12.674 --> 18:13.634
Let's focus on Linda.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.720
We ought to be able to figure her out.
We can just liven her up a bit.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.681
We'll just sprinkle some cocaine
on her peppermints or something.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.975
Does anyone else find it suspicious

18:22.059 --> 18:25.020
that the Bad Place
sent someone so... dull?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.730
No, it makes perfect sense to me.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.732
They are trying to drive us insane

18:28.816 --> 18:31.652
by giving us
a big, boring glob of plain yogurt.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.321
Tomorrow morning,
we start Operation Linda.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.115
Okay, you heard the lady.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.283
We'll meet in the town square
bright and early.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.535
Janet, set up for Flying Day.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.036
Cool.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.205
I'm not busy or anything,
so that'll be easy.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.207
Off you go!

18:45.749 --> 18:48.127
Whoo-hoo!

18:48.752 --> 18:51.964
Linda. How are you
enjoying the Good Place?

18:52.047 --> 18:53.215
It's good.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.135
Everyone's flying.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.262
You don't want to go flying any higher?

18:58.345 --> 18:59.513
No, thanks.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.473
Well, okay.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.600
It says in your file
that you liked knitting.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.727
Would you like to do
some knitting right now?

19:05.811 --> 19:06.854
No, thanks.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.481
Is there another activity
you'd like to do now?

19:10.107 --> 19:13.402
You also enjoyed... listening to birds?

19:14.027 --> 19:15.154
Man, Linda.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.156
You don't even look at them?

19:17.781 --> 19:20.367
Let's go hear some birds. What do you say?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.119
I'm gonna go get another peppermint.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.412
-No--
-Come on, Linds.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.498
You can have literally anything
that you could poss--

19:27.416 --> 19:28.333
What the--

19:39.178 --> 19:41.221
Okay. So...

19:41.305 --> 19:43.557
-Maybe she's less boring than I thought.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.395
So, let me get this straight, Shawn.

19:48.478 --> 19:52.232
You sent a demon in disguise
as one of the subjects?

19:52.316 --> 19:54.318
Yes, he did, Your Honor.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.993
Luckily, none of the other test subjects
saw the mess he made.

20:03.076 --> 20:07.206
But he put the experiment at risk
and he attacked me and Eleanor.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.458
And, I'm sorry, where's your shirt?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.710
I think it got stuck in the skin suit.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.253
Well, keep it there.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.089
Damn it, Chris. You were supposed
to slowly undermine them

20:16.173 --> 20:18.342
and gradually sabotage the experiment,

20:18.425 --> 20:20.636
not just go ham on day two,
you fart plume.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.596
I told you, I'm not an actor.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.640
And when you get back here,
you won't be anything.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.726
Okay, fine, yes, busted. I'm a rascal.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.020
We'll come pick him up
and replace him with an actual human.

20:30.103 --> 20:33.190
You will do nothing of the sort, <i>mon ami.</i>

20:33.273 --> 20:35.567
This outrageous act must be punished.

20:36.151 --> 20:38.737
Chidi will be the fourth subject
in this experiment.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.280
No, no, no, no, no.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.532
He's perfect because he's already
had his memories erased.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.577
Although you can't erase that booty.
Know what I'm sayin', blondie?

20:45.661 --> 20:48.080
All due respect, Your Honor,
keep it in your robe.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.375
What she means is,
"Thank you, Your Honor, we accept."

20:51.458 --> 20:52.960
Chidi's gonna be our fourth subject.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.795
Chidi can't be part of the experiment.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.171
They already know that he can improve.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.049
That's like studying for a test
then acing the test.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.218
-It's cheating.
-How is that cheating?

21:01.301 --> 21:04.304
You're just falsely accusing us
of what you actually did.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.597
No, that's what you're doing.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.391
Shawn, I don't have time for this.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.685
I just started <i>Deadwood,</i> finally,

21:09.768 --> 21:12.938
and I need my daily dose
of Timothy Olyphant,

21:13.021 --> 21:14.606
so I'm gonna make this short.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.860
If you so much as breathe
on this experiment again,

21:18.944 --> 21:22.406
I will restart the entire thing
from scratch,

21:22.489 --> 21:26.159
and then I will personally
rip off your eyelids

21:26.243 --> 21:31.039
and make you watch heartwarming videos
of soldiers coming home to their dogs.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.001
Whoa! Slow down.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.340
Did you put those trash cans
there just so you could crash into them?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.926
That wasn't my fault. I was texting.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.386
Okay, let him go, dung buckets.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.846
Nice try.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.807
We'll put him on the train
and handcuff him to a bench.

21:48.890 --> 21:49.975
Come on.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.061
Yeah, forgive us if we don't trust you
not to cheat again.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.647
Surprised you figured out
that Linda was a fake,

21:55.731 --> 21:58.650
because we all thought
you were too stupid.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.486
Well, it was actually Tahani
who got suspicious.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.196
Oh!

22:03.280 --> 22:05.073
That is so embarrassing for you.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.535
Seems like you're royally forking this up
just like we knew you would.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.120
-Okay.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.204
Take off.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.831
And give Shawn a message for me.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.208
Tell him that we said, "Booyah!"

22:16.376 --> 22:18.920
Make sure you do the hand motion,
like, "Booyah!"

22:19.004 --> 22:20.756
-Are you listening to me?
-Okay, Michael--

22:20.839 --> 22:22.215
-No, show me how you're gonna do it.
-That's fine.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.760
No, it's important
that she does the hand thing

22:24.843 --> 22:26.720
because it really drives the point home.
