Alison:
Previously on <i>the affair...</i>

00:09.010 --> 00:11.677
- There was this girl working
here the last time we came.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.112
- I'll let her know
you stopped by.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.646
- Helen and I are trying
to raise

00:14.648 --> 00:18.217
Decent human beings--
not just get more, spend more.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.686
- As you accept our money
for private school tuition?

00:20.688 --> 00:23.255
- Mom, stop trying
to pick a fight with my husband.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.157
- I'm doing some research
for my book.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.092
- Well, how about a tour
of the island?

00:27.094 --> 00:30.562
This island is famous
for its old victorian hotels.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.298
I want to know what it feels
like to be underneath you.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.633
- I need a room, please.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.135
- Will that be cash or credit?

00:36.137 --> 00:37.403
- How much do you need?

00:37.405 --> 00:38.804
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hey.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.773
- Oh, your girl's here.
- My girl?

00:40.775 --> 00:42.274
- Weren't you looking
for alison earlier?

00:42.276 --> 00:44.243
- No, I think you
must have misunderstood.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.377
- I'm sure I did.
- If I were you,

00:45.379 --> 00:46.779
I'd be talking to oscar hodges.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.380
There are feuds out here
that have been

00:48.382 --> 00:49.648
Going on for almost a century.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.383
- Between the hodges
and the lockharts?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.252
- You don't understand
this town, detective.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.720
- Who the fuck died and--

00:54.722 --> 00:56.588
- We may fight,
we may hurt each other.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.257
But we're like family here.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.592
- You care about me, bailey,
because we go way back.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.262
And because you understand
that people need to change

01:03.264 --> 01:04.530
In order to survive.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.798
- Here it is.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.800
That's him.
- Your grandfather?

01:07.802 --> 01:09.601
- He raised me.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.603
They say this beach is haunted.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.806
- Seems like such
a pleasant place.

01:13.808 --> 01:16.275
- I had a son.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.310
He drowned.
- When?

01:18.312 --> 01:20.679
- Two years ago.
- What was his name?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.281
- Gabriel.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.849
You don't want this.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.881
We grew up together.

08:02.883 --> 08:06.218
She's a folk musician and she

think about leaving?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.235

08:23.237 --> 08:25.871
When I was younger
I wanted to be a doctor.

08:25.873 --> 08:29.641

- I thought about it.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.515
- What happened?

08:36.517 --> 08:38.583
- It was way too expensive.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.785
We didn't have enough money.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.255
I mean, I tried to get
a scholarship,

08:43.257 --> 08:45.857
But my boards
weren't good enough.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.727

don't you?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.318

09:13.320 --> 09:18.757
- That's what
you're thinking right now.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.592
- Yeah.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.066
- My father drove a truck.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.168
My mom was a waitress.

09:31.904 --> 09:35.774
I went to college
on a swimming scholarship.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.311

- Mm-hmm.

09:39.313 --> 09:43.648

10:30.364 --> 10:32.697
She hasn't been there in years,

10:32.699 --> 10:36.001
And now she's trying to change
my grandmother's medication.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.969
She's probably broken up
with another boyfriend

10:37.971 --> 10:41.106
And to make herself feel
better she decides to come home

10:41.108 --> 10:44.709
And fuck everything up.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.379
My grandmother has alzheimer's.

10:47.381 --> 10:48.980
And when she's not on medication

10:48.982 --> 10:50.749
She's hysterical
because it's terrifying.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.752
But of course athena
doesn't care about that.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.120
- Who's athena?

10:55.122 --> 10:57.122
- My mother.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.063
- Can I see you later?

you were coming.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.996
- Well, it was an impulse visit.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.165
I sensed that my mother
needed me.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.367
And of course
I always want to see you.

You look so pretty.

not doing well at all.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.445
I could feel it all the way
in jaipur.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.381
And then when I got here
she was just so out of it.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.850
They overmedicate them so they
don't have to deal with them,

13:05.852 --> 13:07.318
You know.
- No, she's not overmedicated.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.020
- Sweetie,
she didn't even recognize me.

from cherry's orchard.

wanting to be famous.

a friend of yours?

She was here earlier.

- It's athena, your daughter.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.905
- Mama?

14:00.907 --> 14:03.508
- I had a daughter, shelly.

- I changed it, mom.
Remember?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.479
- She was very bright.

but I am a healer.

of energy work.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.064
- No, I'm not--

14:26.066 --> 14:28.199
- It was me
who went to nursing school.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.634
You were right, grandma.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.336

and spiritual development.

is flourishing.

14:56.496 --> 15:01.132
And I do workshops and trainings
all over the world.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.567
- Is sal here with you?

15:02.569 --> 15:05.270
- No, we're no longer
traveling together.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.405
- Oh, you mean you broke up?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.508
- We came to the end
of our story.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.113
It's time to take your pills.

- Oh, god. Look how much
they're giving her.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.918
- What is it? What's wrong?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.386
- It's too many drugs, mom.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.054
- No, they're trying
to poison me again.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.989
- No, no,
no one's gonna hurt you.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.691
They love you here.

15:26.693 --> 15:31.462
And I'd never let anyone give
you the wrong medicine, okay?

28:51.197 --> 28:54.198
- Oh, that's good.
I'll be good.

29:05.977 --> 29:09.113
- Mom, I thought you were going
to fix the roof last summer.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.380
- I was.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.349
But honey,
the estimate was $50,000.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.351
- Get out the duct tape, boys.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.487
- That's like 6,000 jars of jam.

29:16.489 --> 29:17.988
- How do you know that?

29:17.990 --> 29:19.490
- Mary kate's really good
with math.

29:19.492 --> 29:23.260
- Mom got another call
from a realtor.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.095
- So?
- It was a very high offer.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.297
- How much?

29:27.299 --> 29:29.133
- $30 million.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.435
- That's like $6 million each.
- My god...

29:31.437 --> 29:33.036
- More like 4 something...
- Sell it!

29:33.038 --> 29:34.371
- After taxes.
- Oh, really? Only $4 million?

29:34.373 --> 29:36.240
- You could reinvent yourself,
cherry!

29:36.242 --> 29:38.242
- It's up to my sons.
- It's your ranch.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.110
- We're not selling the ranch.
- It's their inheritance, dear.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.546
- Can we at least talk about it?
- There's nothing to talk about.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.282
- The ranch has been in the
family for seven generations.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.117
- Jesus christ!
- Do you want to be the one

29:47.119 --> 29:48.152
That loses it?
- You're not our fucking father.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.186
Stop acting like you are!

29:49.188 --> 29:50.387
- It's not just about me!

29:50.389 --> 29:52.055
What would you do
with that money?

29:52.057 --> 29:53.991
- Come with me a minute.
I want to give you something.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.292
- It's none of your
goddamn business, okay?

29:55.294 --> 29:56.794
- I guarantee you blow it
in five years.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.228
- Well, maybe I
want to go back to school.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.332
[music box melody]

30:08.807 --> 30:10.307
- It was my wedding band.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.142
- Oh...

30:12.144 --> 30:13.944
- I want you to have it.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.145
- Oh, cherry, I can't.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.547
- No, you must.

30:16.549 --> 30:21.218
Please, try it on.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.253
Try it on.

30:26.191 --> 30:30.561
I want to thank you
for taking care of my son.

30:30.563 --> 30:34.031
He acts like he
doesn't need anyone.

30:34.033 --> 30:37.167
And maybe you think
he doesn't really need you.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.936
Am I right?

30:38.938 --> 30:41.438
- I...I...

30:41.440 --> 30:43.974
- He does.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.443
You mean everything to him.

30:48.913 --> 30:51.582
You both work so hard
to be strong.

30:51.584 --> 30:54.852
Maybe it's hard to be...

30:54.854 --> 30:57.588
Soft with one another?

30:57.590 --> 30:59.456
- Why, did he say something?

30:59.458 --> 31:03.327
- No.
Please, he would never.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.896
I just know what it's like
to be married.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.939
- So, where did you two
run off to?

31:15.941 --> 31:17.641
- Cherry just needed some help
in the kitchen.

31:17.643 --> 31:22.346
- Cole, do you recognize this?

31:22.348 --> 31:25.249
- Of course I do.
That's your ring mom, isn't it?

31:25.251 --> 31:27.517
- It is.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.086
- You're giving that to ali?

31:29.088 --> 31:30.420
- I'm giving it
to both of you.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.089
- Oh, my god.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.391
I should give you
all my old wedding rings, too.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.526
One couldn't possibly be enough.
- Athena.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.996
- Let us remind you how shackled
to this family you really are,

31:38.998 --> 31:40.397
Alison?
- Athena, don't.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.165
- How many wedding rings
do you have?

31:42.167 --> 31:44.268
- I didn't get
the monogamy gene, darling.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.569
Not everyone does.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.271
But this culture
has brainwashed most women

31:47.273 --> 31:49.273
Into thinking
that's all they really want.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.407
- Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.575
- Do not apologize to her.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.378
She should be apologizing
to you.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.380
- For what, exactly?

31:56.382 --> 31:58.282
- Don't.
- You wouldn't know this

31:58.284 --> 32:01.151
Because you've been m.I.A.
For most of the last two years,

32:01.153 --> 32:04.288
But when things got really bad,
this is where we came.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.023
To my mother's house.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.591
She's the one
that fed your daughter

32:07.593 --> 32:09.393
When she couldn't eat.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.528
She's the one that held her
when she couldn't sleep.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.163
She's the one that bathed her
when she was

32:13.165 --> 32:15.132
Still terrified of water.
Where the fuck were you?

32:15.134 --> 32:16.533
- You didn't want me here, cole.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.402
And you made that very clear.
- Athena, I--

32:18.404 --> 32:20.170
- You can bully everyone at this
table but you cannot bully me!

32:20.172 --> 32:23.607
- I think it's time to go.
Where are you staying?

32:23.609 --> 32:26.043
Can we go, please?

32:26.045 --> 32:27.945
- Now? I'm just having fun.

32:44.095 --> 32:49.700
One day you will regret
choosing him over me.

32:49.702 --> 32:52.602
- Don't rewrite history, athena.
I didn't choose anything.

32:52.604 --> 32:53.704
You left.

32:53.706 --> 32:56.606
- Oh...
[laughs]

32:56.608 --> 32:59.710
You have forgotten so much.

32:59.712 --> 33:02.713
I asked you to come with me.

33:02.715 --> 33:05.082
Several times.

33:05.084 --> 33:10.387
To travel the world with me
and have adventures.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.457
And you chose to stay
with your grandparents.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.525
- I was a child.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.627
I wanted to go to school
and be with my friends.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.329
And, you know,
and just be normal.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.998
- Right, and you chose to marry
at a very young age,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.400
Before you could possibly know
who you were.

33:23.402 --> 33:28.605
I'm just saying you've always
craved security, sweetie.

33:28.607 --> 33:34.144
And maybe now that you realize
that there is no such thing,

33:35.480 --> 33:40.450
You are starting
to become someone else, my love.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.225
- Thank you for coming in,
mrs. Bailey.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.394
I hope I haven't kept
you too long.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.495
- We're done?

33:51.497 --> 33:53.330
- We're done.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.536
Now, I'm sorry.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.706
One more thing.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.775
The night of the wedding...

34:04.777 --> 34:06.243
- Yeah?

34:06.245 --> 34:08.412
- Did you talk to scotty?
- Of course.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.580
- Did you notice anything off
about him?

34:10.582 --> 34:14.684
- No, detective.
He was acting like himself.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.053
- Did you see him leave?

34:16.055 --> 34:17.687
- No, we left first.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.523
- And drove back to the city?

34:19.525 --> 34:21.458
- That's right.

34:24.162 --> 34:26.063
- Okay, great.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.598
That's all my questions.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.201
Thank you again for coming in.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.523
- Whit?

35:37.335 --> 35:39.803
Helen? Helen?
- What?

35:39.805 --> 35:42.539
- Whitney's not here.

35:45.676 --> 35:48.678
- She slept at ruby's.

35:51.282 --> 35:53.150
- I'm anti-ruby.

35:53.152 --> 35:58.488
- Yes, well, next time listen to
us when we ask you a question.

35:58.490 --> 36:03.393
Wait, could you get some bagels?

36:03.395 --> 36:04.761
- I'm going running.

36:04.763 --> 36:08.165
- Well, you can run
with a bag of bagels.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.766
It's good for your biceps.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.708
- Where are you going?
- I'm running.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.545
- With your car keys?
- No, I'm driving to get bagels

36:21.547 --> 36:23.413
And then I'm running.
- Can I come?

36:23.415 --> 36:25.515
- No, I'm not just getting
bagels. I'm also running.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.651
- I can run.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.519
- Running is my time
to be alone, okay?

36:29.521 --> 36:33.190
- Aren't you alone all day long?
- Trevor, I said no!

36:35.426 --> 36:38.461
I'm sorry, that came out wrong.
I'm sorry.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.243
- Hi.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.248
- Let's go.
- [laughs] whoa!

37:02.320 --> 37:04.621
Whoo, slow down, tiger.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.956
- I don't have long.

37:05.958 --> 37:08.425
I'm supposed
to be getting bagels.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.961
- No, that's a bad cover.
It takes ten minutes.

37:10.963 --> 37:13.330
- Let's just not talk.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.966
- Well, maybe you can say
there's a long line.

37:15.968 --> 37:17.567
- Do you not want
to do this now?

37:17.569 --> 37:18.835
- Yes, I want to do this.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.337
But you're really stressed.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.771
- No, I just really
want to fuck you.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.707
- Yeah, I know.
Like slamming a shot.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.475
- Never heard of a quickie?

37:25.477 --> 37:27.377
- Just text her

37:27.379 --> 37:29.846
And say you're waiting
for a fresh batch of sesame.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.549
Or the kind she likes.

37:34.518 --> 37:36.253
- Poppy.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.455
- I wasn't actually asking.

37:40.391 --> 37:42.859
- Okay.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.027
- Feel better?

37:44.029 --> 37:45.729
- Just take your pants off.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.471
[cell phone chimes]
oh, shit.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.673
Fuck.
- What?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.742
- "never mind about the bagels
just come home.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.745
Major crisis."

38:01.747 --> 38:03.913
I'm sure it's nothing.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.583
Boys just playing hockey
in the house--something broke.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.055
[cell phone chimes]
this is your fault.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.490
- Check it.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.426
- Later.
- What if it's important?

38:16.428 --> 38:18.361
- Alison, you're
really killing the mood.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.830
- I just don't want another text
from your wife to interrupt me.

38:20.832 --> 38:24.834
Why can't you just check it
and make sure everything's okay?

38:29.373 --> 38:31.374
- Oh, fuck.

38:34.779 --> 38:39.449
Oh, stop, stop, stop.
- What?

38:39.451 --> 38:40.950
- It's whitney.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.652
- What's wrong? Is she okay?
- I don't know.

38:42.654 --> 38:46.089
It doesn't fucking say.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.824
I gotta go.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.460
I find you later?

38:50.462 --> 38:51.661
- Okay.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.797
[cell phone chimes]

38:53.799 --> 38:54.931
- Damn.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.342
[pop]

39:07.011 --> 39:09.479
Fuck.
Fuck!

39:35.973 --> 39:37.974
I can't believe this.

39:57.895 --> 40:00.864
- Hey buddy.
- Hey.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.166
- What, you got a flat?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.769
- Need some help?
- No, I called aaa.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.670
- Oh, yeah.
Good for you.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.606
What are you doing out
in these parts?

40:09.608 --> 40:11.641
Butlers live
over in hither hills.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.644
- I'm, uh...I'm just--
I was doing some research

40:14.646 --> 40:16.079
For the book I'm writing.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.848
- You're a writer?
- That's right.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.018
- Well, I'll keep you company
while you wait.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.020
That way you won't look
like such a douche.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.989
- Great.

40:32.496 --> 40:35.165
- Yeah, they used to be friends
of my parents, the butlers.

40:35.167 --> 40:37.033
They were some of the first
investors in the lobster roll.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.502
- No kidding?
- Yeah, used to play over there

40:39.504 --> 40:41.638
Sometimes when I was a kid.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.839
Knew your wife a bit.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.073
Of course, she was older.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.175
She probably won't remember me.

40:45.177 --> 40:46.709
- Oh, I wouldn't count on that.

40:46.711 --> 40:49.112
Helen's got a mind
like a steel trap.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.680
- You got your aaa card?

40:50.682 --> 40:52.649
- Right here.

40:52.651 --> 40:56.085
- Thanks.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.587
All right, dude.
You're all set.

40:57.589 --> 40:58.688
- Thanks.

40:58.690 --> 40:59.789
- And here's my number.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.458
- Great.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.559
- Just in case you ever
get in trouble out here again.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.894
- Thanks so much.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.066
Well, it was nice to see you.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.936
- So, what are you up to later?

41:12.938 --> 41:14.604
Want to come fishing
with me and some buddies?

41:14.606 --> 41:16.105
They're pure montauk,
these guys.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.675
Great characters for you.
- Oh, I'd love to, man.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.144
I can't tonight, but thanks.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.746
- Oh, okay.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.014
- We should get a beer sometime.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.082
- Yeah, great.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.651
Take it easy.

41:30.955 --> 41:32.489
- Sorry.

41:32.491 --> 41:33.857
Where's the jack?
I had to call aaa.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.892
- Martin used it
for a science project.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.227
I forgot to put it back,
I guess.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.229
Sorry.

41:39.231 --> 41:43.700
- So, what's
happening with whitney?

41:43.702 --> 41:46.703
- Jody manko's mother called.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.572
Apparently whitney is part
of a group

41:49.574 --> 41:53.710
Of kids that have been
bullying jody online.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.044
- What?

41:55.046 --> 41:58.248
- And yesterday jody
tried to kill herself.

41:58.250 --> 42:01.017
- Oh, my god.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.721
- So, will you let me take
whitney to see a therapist now?

42:07.725 --> 42:09.659
- What?
- She said you set up

42:09.661 --> 42:11.995
A fake twitter account where you
and a lot of other people

42:11.997 --> 42:13.997
Posted really nasty things

42:13.999 --> 42:15.732
About jody.
- No.

42:15.734 --> 42:18.635
- @skankhojodymanko?
- Is that what it was called?

42:18.637 --> 42:20.003
- Yes.
- Skank ho?

42:20.005 --> 42:21.271
- No, I didn't set up
that account.

42:21.273 --> 42:22.872
- Did you post on it?
- No, I didn't.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.307
- Let me see your phone.
- Mom, no.

42:24.309 --> 42:25.608
- Don't say no to me...
- No.

42:25.610 --> 42:26.743
- Let me see your phone.
- No!

42:26.745 --> 42:27.944
Mom!

42:32.283 --> 42:35.652
- Right, you are going to write
a letter of apology right now.

42:35.654 --> 42:36.886
And I'm taking you
to jody's house where you

42:36.888 --> 42:38.288
Will beg her forgiveness...
- No.

42:38.290 --> 42:39.689
- And you will post
an apology...

42:39.691 --> 42:41.024
- No! No!

42:41.026 --> 42:42.225
- On your facebook page!
- No! I'm not!

42:42.227 --> 42:43.660
You can't do that!
- Stop, shh.

42:43.662 --> 42:46.763
- What the hell
is going on out there?

42:46.765 --> 42:48.164
I don't want
you writing one word

42:48.166 --> 42:50.099
Until we talk to gottlieb.
- I left a message.

42:50.101 --> 42:51.801
- And you're not going
over to this girl's house.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.636
- Excuse me.
Yes, she is.

42:53.638 --> 42:56.205
- If she does that, she's
basically conceding guilt.

42:56.207 --> 42:58.041
- She is guilty.
- We don't know that.

42:58.043 --> 43:01.044
- It sounds like this jody
character is unstable, noah.

43:01.046 --> 43:03.246
- And she has no proof
of whitney's culpability.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.815
- She doesn't?
- Whitney!

43:05.817 --> 43:07.050
Look at what they're doing!

43:07.052 --> 43:08.785
- The girl
has a tremendous amount

43:08.787 --> 43:10.320
To gain
by pursuing this legally.

43:10.322 --> 43:12.055
- But she has not pursued
it legally.

43:12.057 --> 43:14.057
- Not yet, sweetheart.
- People try to bring lawsuits

43:14.059 --> 43:15.358
Against me all the time.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.660
They go after the money
however they can.

43:17.662 --> 43:19.662
- Are you out of your mind?

43:19.664 --> 43:21.664
A child just tried
to take her own life

43:21.666 --> 43:24.601
Because of what our kid did.

43:24.603 --> 43:28.004
Jesus.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.706
All you can think
about is your money?

43:29.708 --> 43:31.107
- Whitney, go to your room.
- The money that pays

43:31.109 --> 43:32.275
For your house and the school

43:32.277 --> 43:34.077
That your children go to?
- Yeah,

43:34.079 --> 43:36.346
That illustrious private school
teaches such impeccable values.

43:36.348 --> 43:38.681
- If that's how you feel, maybe
I should stop writing checks.

43:38.683 --> 43:39.849
- No, grandpa please don't
do that.

43:39.851 --> 43:41.284
- I told you to go
to your room...

43:41.286 --> 43:42.819
- I'm telling you
that I wasn't there!

43:42.821 --> 43:44.687
- Or I swear to god
I am gonna lose it!

43:44.689 --> 43:49.125
- Why don't we all take a moment
and collect our thoughts?

43:49.127 --> 43:52.161
Things get very heated
when the children are involved.

43:55.866 --> 43:57.934
- Let us know
when the lawyer calls.

44:02.773 --> 44:04.407
You need to calm down.

44:04.409 --> 44:06.142
- Wait, what?

44:06.144 --> 44:08.111
- She made a mistake.
She's going to apologize.

44:08.113 --> 44:09.846
- A mistake?
Jody tried to kill herself.

44:09.848 --> 44:12.882
- Look, that girl is troubled,
noah.

44:12.884 --> 44:14.150
Okay, you don't try to kill
yourself

44:14.152 --> 44:15.918
Over a few text messages.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.720
- With all due respect, what the
fuck do you know about it?

44:17.722 --> 44:18.921
- What do you mean,
what do I know?

44:18.923 --> 44:21.257
- You were a popular girl,
helen.

44:21.259 --> 44:22.325
And you raised our kid
to be a popular girl...

44:22.327 --> 44:24.160
- I raised her?
Where were you?

44:24.162 --> 44:26.195
- Yeah, well you have no idea,
either of you, what those kids--

44:26.197 --> 44:27.730
The ones that don't fit in--
what they go through

44:27.732 --> 44:29.065
I see it every year.
- Oh, get off your

44:29.067 --> 44:31.000
Fucking high horse.
This has nothing to do

44:31.002 --> 44:32.268
With whitney.

44:32.270 --> 44:33.269
Nothing whatsoever
to do with whitney

44:33.271 --> 44:34.437
And I am not going to watch

44:34.439 --> 44:35.872
My daughter throw her life away

44:35.874 --> 44:38.274
So you can prove a point
to my father.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.009
- You're my wife.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.344
You're on my side.
- I'm on whitney's side.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.945
- Yeah, well did you hear
what she said?

44:42.947 --> 44:44.013
No proof.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.415
She sounds like a sociopath.

44:45.417 --> 44:49.018
- She sounds like a teenager
who needs therapy.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.020
Something I have been
saying for years.

44:51.022 --> 44:52.789
- She wouldn't need therapy
if we didn't spend every fucking

44:52.791 --> 44:55.825
Summer with your lotus-eating
fucking parents--ah, fuck!

44:55.827 --> 44:57.160
Ow.

44:57.162 --> 45:01.297
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

45:01.299 --> 45:02.365
- We should talk to a lawyer.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.067
It doesn't have to be gottlieb.

45:04.069 --> 45:06.369
She will apologize.
Not necessarily in writing.

45:06.371 --> 45:07.437
I have her ipad.

45:07.439 --> 45:09.172
We will not replace the phone.

45:09.174 --> 45:10.807
- Ever, as far as I'm concerned.

45:10.809 --> 45:15.311
- Then, tomorrow
we can go back to brooklyn.

45:15.313 --> 45:18.181
- Wait, what?

45:18.183 --> 45:20.216
- She needs immediate
consequences.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.851
I'm sure ruby was behind this.

45:21.853 --> 45:23.186
You were right, we have
to get her away from here.

45:23.188 --> 45:25.054
- Well, what about
stacey and trevor?

45:25.056 --> 45:26.456
They love camp.
What about martin?

45:26.458 --> 45:27.790
He loves the ranch.
- They'll survive.

45:27.792 --> 45:32.095
- Wait, this'll backfire, helen.

45:32.097 --> 45:33.963
Whitney acts out and then
we take her home?

45:33.965 --> 45:35.865
We're just giving her attention.
- That's what she needs.

45:35.867 --> 45:39.402
- No, she needs discipline.

45:39.404 --> 45:41.504
- I really thought
that you would love the idea

45:41.506 --> 45:43.406
Of going home early.

45:43.408 --> 45:44.807
- Well, I do, of course, for me.

45:44.809 --> 45:47.343
But I mean, all the therapists

45:47.345 --> 45:48.745
Are on vacation anyway,
aren't they?

45:48.747 --> 45:49.846
Most of them
are probably out here.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.147
- Okay, so, now you want

45:51.149 --> 45:52.949
To spend another month
with my parents?

45:52.951 --> 45:54.851
- No, I just want to do
what's right for our family.

45:54.853 --> 45:57.487
- Mr. Noah?
- Please, just call me noah!

45:57.489 --> 46:00.289
- There is a visitor for you.

46:13.237 --> 46:15.238
- Hey.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.240
- Hey hey, there he is.

46:17.242 --> 46:18.775
You dropped your aaa card.

46:18.777 --> 46:20.376
- Oh, thanks man.
- Helen, hey.

46:20.378 --> 46:22.178
Nice to see you again.
You probably don't recognize me.

46:22.180 --> 46:24.447
I've changed a lot.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.983
- I ran into oscar
waiting for the mechanic.

46:26.985 --> 46:28.384
- Yeah, I keep telling the town
they've got to do something

46:28.386 --> 46:30.119
About those potholes out
in ditch plains

46:30.121 --> 46:31.254
And they're, like,
do famous people live there?

46:31.256 --> 46:33.122
No?
Then who cares?

46:33.124 --> 46:34.991
- Ditch plains?
- Yeah.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.259
- Thanks for stopping by, man.

46:36.261 --> 46:38.161
That's great.
Really appreciate that.

46:38.163 --> 46:39.462
We've got something
going on, so...

46:39.464 --> 46:41.164
- Oh, hey,
are bruce and margaret here?

46:41.166 --> 46:42.999
I want to say hey
from my mom and dad,

46:43.001 --> 46:44.400
And ask why they never come
into the restaurant anymore.

46:44.402 --> 46:46.269
Do you know?
- No, but they're old and...

46:46.271 --> 46:48.271
- Yeah, well old people
still have to eat, right?

46:48.273 --> 46:50.273
I mean they always used to--
all right, man! Come on!

46:50.275 --> 46:51.808
- Hey!
- Whoa!

46:51.810 --> 46:55.578
- Hey, jesus christ.

46:55.580 --> 46:58.815
- Just leave now, please.

47:01.218 --> 47:03.085
- Thought we were friends, man.

47:07.825 --> 47:11.027
But you're a douche.

47:11.029 --> 47:13.996
Just like the rest of them.

47:21.572 --> 47:23.840
- I'm taking whitney
over to jody's.

47:32.983 --> 47:35.184
This it?

47:35.186 --> 47:36.552
Whit?
- Yes.

47:53.070 --> 47:54.604
- You're not even sorry
about this.

47:54.606 --> 47:56.606
- I am.
It's horrible what she did.

47:56.608 --> 47:59.108
- What you did.

47:59.110 --> 48:01.611
- Okay, I know
it seems like whatever, but a,

48:01.613 --> 48:03.412
I didn't set up that account.

48:03.414 --> 48:04.614
You tell the people
at twitter that.

48:04.616 --> 48:06.148
- Okay, ruby did it.

48:06.150 --> 48:07.283
She just used my old email
address cause

48:07.285 --> 48:09.151
She'd already used all of hers.

48:09.153 --> 48:12.955
- Oh, so you're not just mean,
you're also stupid.

48:12.957 --> 48:14.557
- Okay, it was just a joke.

48:14.559 --> 48:18.127
Jody calls herself skank ho
manko, and she totally is one.

48:18.129 --> 48:20.963
She had sex with ruby's
boyfriend because ruby wouldn't.

48:20.965 --> 48:23.499
- Whitney, she could've died.

48:23.501 --> 48:28.971
I'm frightened by how little
you seem to understand this.

48:28.973 --> 48:32.642
Your words and your actions
have consequences.

48:32.644 --> 48:38.014
When you do something mean
because you're angry or bored

48:38.016 --> 48:39.248
It happens to someone else.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.984
It hurts them.

48:41.986 --> 48:45.588
You're not the only person
who's real.

48:45.590 --> 48:48.624
- So, what?
Do you think I'm a bad person?

48:51.662 --> 48:54.697
- I think you did a bad thing.

48:54.699 --> 48:56.933
Doing one bad thing
doesn't make you a bad person.

48:56.935 --> 48:59.669
- But what if I did, like,
a lot of bad things?

48:59.671 --> 49:01.637
Would that make me a bad person?

49:06.410 --> 49:08.544
- Definitely make you
an asshole.

49:08.546 --> 49:10.680
- I don't want to be an asshole.

49:10.682 --> 49:14.216
- Then you don't have to be.

49:14.218 --> 49:15.418
- But what do I do?

49:15.420 --> 49:18.321
How do I un-asshole myself?

49:18.323 --> 49:20.489
- Just stop doing bad things.

49:53.757 --> 49:55.591
Just stop.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.001
Hi.

50:07.504 --> 50:08.604
- How'd it go?

50:08.606 --> 50:10.573
- Fine, she did great.

50:13.777 --> 50:15.644
- I just talked to my therapist.

50:15.646 --> 50:19.615
She's going to help us find
someone out here for her to see.

50:19.617 --> 50:22.084
And she also says we should be
having as much contact

50:22.086 --> 50:24.620
As possible with her.

50:24.622 --> 50:28.357
- What does that mean?

50:28.359 --> 50:31.494
- Family dinners, weekends.

50:31.496 --> 50:34.397
We need to be more involved.

50:34.399 --> 50:35.664
- Of course.

50:35.666 --> 50:37.233
It's our fault.

50:37.235 --> 50:41.637
Kids today
can never just be wrong.

50:41.639 --> 50:43.806
- Gross.

50:43.808 --> 50:46.776
I'm trying out this natural
deodorant for the store.

50:46.778 --> 50:51.380
It's fucking useless.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.516
I think one of us should be home
after school this year.

50:53.518 --> 50:56.285
I keep reading that teenagers
need as much supervision

50:56.287 --> 50:58.788
As toddlers.

50:58.790 --> 51:02.291
- How would we do that?
I mean, how does anyone?

51:02.293 --> 51:05.661
People work.

51:05.663 --> 51:07.797
- I guess I could sell
the store.

51:07.799 --> 51:09.398
- No, come on.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.202
You love the store.

51:15.172 --> 51:20.276
- Well, is there any way
you could take the semester off?

51:20.278 --> 51:23.746
You could focus on your book
and be there for the kids.

51:23.748 --> 51:27.216
- First of all, I can't just ask
for the fall off in July.

51:27.218 --> 51:32.688
And even if I could,
how do we afford that?

51:32.690 --> 51:34.557
- My parents.
They want to help.

51:34.559 --> 51:35.825
Look, I know you don't want...
- Helen.

51:35.827 --> 51:37.493
- To talk about it
but what does it matter

51:37.495 --> 51:39.462
How much money
we accept from them?

51:39.464 --> 51:40.863
If it makes our lives easier

51:40.865 --> 51:43.699
And it's all gonna
be mine one day, anyway?

51:43.701 --> 51:45.768
Why are you making
that horrible face at me?

51:45.770 --> 51:47.636
- I have a fucking headache and
I don't want to take more money

51:47.638 --> 51:49.105
From your parents.

51:49.107 --> 51:51.207
- Fine. That's fine. Fine.

51:51.209 --> 51:52.708
But you're never gonna
be successful if you only

51:52.710 --> 51:55.711
Write one book a decade.

51:55.713 --> 51:58.214
- I'm never gonna be successful?

51:58.216 --> 51:59.315
- That's not what I said.

51:59.317 --> 52:00.850
I just said, I mean, you--

52:00.852 --> 52:03.586
Look, you just deserve
to have some time...

52:03.588 --> 52:05.187
- Sorry, I thought I
was doing pretty well.

52:05.189 --> 52:06.856
I guess I'm just
a parasite leeching money

52:06.858 --> 52:08.491
Off your successful father

52:08.493 --> 52:10.359
So I can delude myself
I'm a fucking writer...

52:10.361 --> 52:12.461
- Stop, stop, stop!
I just want you to be happy.

52:12.463 --> 52:14.130
- I am happy!

52:14.132 --> 52:15.464
At least I was until I
started listening to you.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.199
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

52:17.201 --> 52:18.734
- A walk, a run,

52:18.736 --> 52:20.336
What were you doing
in ditch plains this morning?

52:20.338 --> 52:21.737
- I was running...
- Miles from town...

52:21.739 --> 52:23.472
- I told you.
- Running with the car?

52:23.474 --> 52:25.641
- Yeah, well, I had to get
the bagels after for you.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.276
Cause god forbid you don't get

52:27.278 --> 52:28.344
Everything you want
exactly when you want it.

52:28.346 --> 52:29.411
- Oh, fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

52:29.413 --> 52:30.880
- No, fuck you!

52:30.882 --> 52:34.150
And you better be here
for fucking family dinner!

52:43.760 --> 52:46.295
- And is this really
what you want to know?

52:46.297 --> 52:49.265
Details on some fight
I had with my wife?

52:49.267 --> 52:51.500
- [chuckles]
not really.

52:51.502 --> 52:56.372
I'm getting nasty flashbacks.

52:56.374 --> 52:57.773
You're free to go.

52:57.775 --> 53:00.276
Thanks for your help.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.244
- Was I helpful?

53:02.246 --> 53:04.246
- Very.

53:06.683 --> 53:08.450
- You got anyone in mind?

53:08.452 --> 53:10.319
- I think so.

53:15.592 --> 53:19.962
- Can I ask you a question,
detective?

53:19.964 --> 53:21.797
- Of course.

53:21.799 --> 53:25.267
- What makes you so sure
it wasn't an accident?

53:25.269 --> 53:28.270
- I don't believe in accidents.

53:30.674 --> 53:35.678
Mr. Solloway, do you know
a place called the end?

53:37.581 --> 53:39.315
- No, what is it?

53:39.317 --> 53:40.816
- It's a club out in montauk.

53:40.818 --> 53:44.820
I believe scotty was
headed that way when he died.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.490
So, you've never been?

53:48.492 --> 53:50.359
- Never.

54:14.351 --> 54:15.651
- What's wrong?

54:28.865 --> 54:34.837
[heavy breathing and moaning]

55:08.505 --> 55:12.508
- Do you want to run away
with me?

55:16.646 --> 55:18.647
- Yes.

55:20.650 --> 55:22.551
- Yes?

55:22.553 --> 55:25.054
- Yes.

55:25.056 --> 55:27.089
Yes.

55:27.091 --> 55:30.059
- Yeah?

55:30.061 --> 55:32.027
Yes?
