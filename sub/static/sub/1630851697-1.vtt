WEBVTT

02:13.034 --> 02:15.402
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

02:34.654 --> 02:35.723
I love you.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.669
Jasper!

02:58.746 --> 02:59.914
Hey!

03:02.884 --> 03:04.417
Fuck! Whoa. Whoa.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.653
- Oh, my god.
- What's your problem? Dad?

03:06.686 --> 03:07.788
Oh!

03:07.822 --> 03:09.757
Ah! Hey, Hannah.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.425
How's it going, Jasper?

03:16.529 --> 03:17.899
Is it okay? Because it...

03:18.498 --> 03:20.433
Smells like you've burned
something.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.408
So Hannah, is this, um...

03:29.609 --> 03:31.611
Is this part of...

03:31.645 --> 03:33.214
- The gay thing?
- Dad!

03:33.247 --> 03:35.216
No, I'm just saying
if it is, I'm cool.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.584
- It's not part of it.
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

03:37.617 --> 03:40.154
Whoa, I think it's totally
a part of the gay thing.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.856
I mean this is who
I am now, man.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.623
I'm like totally a nudist.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.992
Oh.

03:45.026 --> 03:46.693
Okay.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.064
You girls are so brave.

03:51.933 --> 03:53.633
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

03:54.135 --> 03:55.836
If you were,
you wouldn't have done it.

03:55.870 --> 03:58.005
If I hadn't, I'd have
nothing be sorry about it.

03:58.272 --> 04:01.474
- And besides, your dad loves me.
- Yeah, dude, but that's my dad.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.543
You're embarrassing.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.012
Okay, I guess.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.617
Okay, I'm sorry. All right?
You were right.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.485
That was stupid of me,

04:12.519 --> 04:15.189
and I didn't mean to mess
anything up, okay? I'm sorry.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.171
Look, I'm sorry.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.807
I'm sorry.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.876
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:35.910 --> 04:38.245
It's okay, thank you.

04:39.981 --> 04:41.716
I just need to get out
of that house.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.251
My dad is too much
of a risk, apparently.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.518
Apparently.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.857
If only I had someone I could
split an apartment with.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.027
The risk doesn't really outweigh
the sweet hookup that you have.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.097
He doesn't make you pay rent
and he buys all your groceries.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.866
- He loves the homosexual youth.
- He's too much.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.935
The other day he genuinely
asked me

05:00.968 --> 05:02.635
if he should exclusively buy me
pants now.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.571
He buys you pants.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.974
Dude, he's been so supportive
since you came out last year.

05:07.008 --> 05:09.143
I just need to finally move out.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.312
I'm 22 years old,
I'm not a child anymore.

05:11.345 --> 05:15.582
Whoa, whoa, 22 absolutely still
constitutes as being a child.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.786
Why you gonna do that?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.287
Do what?

05:20.321 --> 05:23.290
We're children. We are children
that crave sweet,

05:23.324 --> 05:25.793
sweet parent juice, man.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.631
Hey!

05:33.034 --> 05:34.702
Those kids owe me money.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.237
You owe me 40 bucks, dude!

05:59.293 --> 06:00.795
You're not eating breakfast?

06:15.743 --> 06:16.744
Hey!

06:16.777 --> 06:17.845
Sorry sch-Megan.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.246
Mom, he called me sch-Megan.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.115
Don't call your sister
sch-Megan.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.350
It's like schmegma and Megan.

06:24.919 --> 06:26.686
What the fuck is schmegma?

06:27.922 --> 06:30.291
Jesus Christ,
you're not eating breakfast!

06:34.962 --> 06:36.397
Nicky, what...?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.165
Mom, I gotta go.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.967
I can't remember the last time

06:40.000 --> 06:41.969
she didn't say "fuck"
in a sentence.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.704
You have to eat.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.073
Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.412
What are you guys doing here?

06:51.445 --> 06:52.722
I thought I was
picking you guys up.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.848
Grab his leg!

06:53.881 --> 06:55.316
Ma'am.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.917
- Hi, Hannah.
- Grab his leg, Hannah!

06:59.320 --> 07:02.089
What the fuck
you doing acting like that?

07:02.123 --> 07:04.792
Throwing each other around like
a bunch of fucking loony tunes.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.393
Sorry about
that Mrs. Nick's mom.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.863
It's been but a score
since I've seen your son last,

07:08.896 --> 07:12.665
and I thought, he looks like he
could use a good ass-kicking.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.370
Are you gonna
take this breakfast

07:16.403 --> 07:18.105
that I made for you or not?

07:25.946 --> 07:29.316
Congratulations, your first
student loan bill came in.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.130
Why are you giving
this to me right now?

07:33.154 --> 07:34.855
I'm literally about to leave.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.426
Why do you always do
this kind of sh...

07:40.461 --> 07:41.729
Thing.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.964
Always taking
the most dramatic option.

07:43.998 --> 07:45.833
I'm literally on my way
out the door

07:45.866 --> 07:47.944
and you hand me a problem
that I can't manage right now.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.905
- What's your problem?
- Nick, that was the deal.

07:50.938 --> 07:54.241
What was the deal? The one where
you do this weird manipulative,

07:54.275 --> 07:57.845
keep me on your leash-type shit?
I'm literally leaving right now.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.122
I don't have this kind of money.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.091
You're the one who wanted me to
go to school in the first place.

08:01.115 --> 08:02.383
Are you kidding me?

08:04.952 --> 08:06.487
When are you all back?

08:06.520 --> 08:09.390
A week. We're staying at my
family's beach house.

08:10.191 --> 08:11.358
Oh.

08:11.392 --> 08:13.194
Must be nice.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.397
Well, it was really great
seeing you Mrs. N.

08:26.941 --> 08:27.975
I love you.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.009
What was that?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.847
I don't think I heard you right.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.350
- Mom, I'm 23.
- You're still living at home.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.818
- I just got back.
- Nick!

08:40.087 --> 08:41.422
I love you!

08:50.564 --> 08:53.467
- Problems?
- No, mom.

09:06.914 --> 09:11.785
So, what? Guess you
can't go now, right?

09:14.989 --> 09:16.566
Do you want me to see if I can
borrow my dad's car?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.025
The dadillac?

09:40.247 --> 09:43.017
I can't believe he salvaged
this after the incident.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.519
No, no, we are not talking
about the incident.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.354
But what we
are going to talk about

09:47.388 --> 09:49.523
is how you look like you were
about to cry back there.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.458
Me? No, I was caught up
in the moment.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.994
Even the world's greatest
singers get caught up.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.863
You think Gandhi's ass
didn't stutter?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.831
Look, guys, the last time
that I saw my parents

09:57.865 --> 09:59.500
they were blowing coke off
a machete

09:59.533 --> 10:01.435
and about to take
down the cartel.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.237
And they were gone.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.205
What?

10:05.239 --> 10:08.208
Your mom messaged me on
Facebook,

10:08.242 --> 10:10.878
like two weeks ago
about graduation.

10:11.746 --> 10:14.181
Okay, what I'm trying to say
is that I would rather believe

10:14.214 --> 10:16.216
that my parents are
jungle warlords instead of

10:16.250 --> 10:18.986
spiteful homophobes who kicked
me out when I was 16.

10:19.353 --> 10:21.288
And hey, Nick, do me a favor.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.390
Could you delete my mom
on Facebook?

10:23.424 --> 10:24.601
- 'Cause that'd be great.
- Okay.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.893
Thank you.

10:26.527 --> 10:28.462
Look, I guess
what I'm trying to say

10:28.495 --> 10:30.197
is that at least your dad
supports you,

10:30.230 --> 10:32.333
and at least your mom
is getting your lazy ass

10:32.366 --> 10:33.610
out of the house, and at now
you're chasing it.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.337
Out there chasing
that pussy, yo.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.572
- There he is, everyone.
- That counts!

10:38.605 --> 10:39.973
Does not!

10:40.709 --> 10:43.143
Yo, so what's changed
at the beach house?

10:43.812 --> 10:45.579
I don't know,
I haven't gone up there

10:45.612 --> 10:47.147
since we all went like
two years ago.

10:47.181 --> 10:49.383
I don't want to go without
everybody.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.919
- The dusty old beach house.
- Shut up!

10:52.286 --> 10:53.563
Hey Jasper,
could you check my bag?

10:53.587 --> 10:54.988
There should be cigarettes.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.490
You smoke now?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.268
You think you're Clint Eastwood
or some shit?

10:58.292 --> 10:59.927
Clint Eastwood?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.638
When's the last time
you seen a movie, 1979?

11:01.662 --> 11:03.340
Yeah, it was probably last year
it was cool to smoke, too!

11:03.364 --> 11:04.365
Relax!

11:04.398 --> 11:05.999
Oh! Dude, these are gross!

11:12.539 --> 11:13.539
Oh!

11:14.608 --> 11:16.510
Bye!

11:16.543 --> 11:20.047
Wanna know why, man?
Cause only butts smoke butts!

11:23.650 --> 11:25.586
No, no, no, don't smoke weed
in the car.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.355
But this is not weed.
This is resin.

11:28.389 --> 11:32.092
And this little lady just
happened to find the reservoir.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.594
We all have our vices.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.562
Yeah, apparently.
Don't smoke weed in the car!

11:35.596 --> 11:38.699
Oh my god, dude,
that was pure butane,

11:38.733 --> 11:40.334
that was absolute pure butane.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.712
This is gonna give you
permanent brain fog.

11:41.736 --> 11:43.370
- I'm bringing up the incident!
- Don't!

11:43.404 --> 11:44.447
Remember that time
in high school

11:44.471 --> 11:45.506
we stole the dadillac?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.975
And it's like two A.M.
and you blow through

11:48.008 --> 11:50.043
the fucking stop light
right into the cop car?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.945
- My dad was pissed.
- Rightfully so.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.347
I literally have no idea

11:53.380 --> 11:55.416
why he'd ever let you borrow
that again.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.451
But that was a classic
brain fog moment.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.219
Oh, come on, dude!

11:59.253 --> 12:01.388
Let's just like not pretend
that I'm the only one

12:01.422 --> 12:03.190
who got us in trouble back then.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.094
What's happening?

12:07.528 --> 12:09.229
Ah...

12:09.263 --> 12:12.032
It seems as though
we've run out of gas.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.501
Oh.

12:14.535 --> 12:16.537
Case and point everyone,
case and point.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.672
Thank you.

12:23.377 --> 12:25.279
Hey, can I get a, um...

12:26.513 --> 12:27.749
Hey.

12:27.782 --> 12:30.350
- What are you doing?
- I'm hungry.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.300
Want some?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.367
You sure?

12:48.469 --> 12:50.237
I know you from somewhere.

12:51.472 --> 12:55.710
- I don't know if you do.
- Oh, I totally do.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.745
We went to high school together.

12:57.779 --> 12:59.680
You're Nick maloney.

12:59.714 --> 13:01.181
Baloney maloney.

13:02.817 --> 13:04.752
It's Malone.

13:04.786 --> 13:06.620
Yeah. Yeah. Right, right.
And you!

13:08.088 --> 13:09.690
You're that weird gay girl.

13:11.425 --> 13:12.359
Jasper.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.261
Jasper, right.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.431
Hey, you sell pot to my cousin
and his friends.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.066
Where's my money?

13:24.505 --> 13:27.709
You do know he's like 16, right?

13:27.742 --> 13:30.244
Stranger danger!

13:30.277 --> 13:31.311
Where's my money? Fuck!

13:32.145 --> 13:35.783
Well, weed's actually medically
legal in most states now.

13:36.350 --> 13:37.785
Is it?

13:38.452 --> 13:40.120
So is that just
like your whole thing?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.756
You work in a gas station,

13:41.789 --> 13:43.500
and talk shit to everybody
who comes through?

13:43.524 --> 13:47.427
Oh shit, it's like
a high school reunion in here.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.797
Daddy still paying your bills?

13:49.831 --> 13:52.499
Okay, you know, at least we
were memorable. Okay?

13:52.533 --> 13:54.535
Yeah well, so was 9/11, so.

13:59.774 --> 14:01.041
Hey!

14:05.512 --> 14:07.314
Not today, dirtbags!

14:10.250 --> 14:11.451
That's right.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.555
You tried to pull some
<i>mission impossible</i> type shit

14:14.588 --> 14:16.156
but got caught stealing.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.793
And I'm calling the cops.

14:18.826 --> 14:21.328
No, no. Dude, come on.
Please don't.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.264
Y'all thought you were
Tom fucking cruise, didn't ya?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.233
Pro tip, bitches.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.502
I'm the Tom Cruise
of this establishment.

14:29.737 --> 14:31.605
I thought your name was Marvin?

14:33.307 --> 14:36.076
Hey, man, don't call the cops.
Sorry, we're not Tom Cruise.

14:36.410 --> 14:38.746
We never thought we were
Tom Cruise. What did she steal?

14:38.780 --> 14:40.715
She'll give you the money
for it right now.

14:40.748 --> 14:42.316
And we'll call it square, okay?

14:47.487 --> 14:48.655
Give me 50.

14:49.523 --> 14:51.158
Fifty bucks?

14:51.191 --> 14:52.535
There's only a few
street treats, my friend.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.095
Fifty or I'm gonna call
the cops.

14:57.631 --> 14:58.665
I don't...

15:08.275 --> 15:09.476
Oh, yeah.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.685
Hometown heroes
who still think they're 16.

15:20.822 --> 15:22.155
Grow up.

15:27.962 --> 15:30.597
What the fuck, guys,
with the snacks?

15:30.631 --> 15:33.835
Come on, look, I'm really sorry
and I promise I'll pay you back.

15:33.868 --> 15:37.404
But, like, come,
that guy fucking sucks!

15:37.437 --> 15:40.240
- And we're all good, right?
- Now give me that Booty.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.548
Dude, you can't
smoke weed in the car.

15:49.784 --> 15:50.784
Come on.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.293
Faster!

16:02.462 --> 16:05.532
Yeah! Round and around.

16:05.565 --> 16:09.636
Bring it around, baby.
Turn that around.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.438
Whoo!

16:12.472 --> 16:15.442
Don't stop, don't stop.

16:15.943 --> 16:19.947
Keep it going, keep it going.
Yes, yes, yes.

16:19.981 --> 16:21.481
Wasn't that the exit?

16:21.515 --> 16:23.450
Nick, shut your mouth, come on!

16:23.483 --> 16:25.419
Keep her going!

16:25.452 --> 16:27.320
Yep, that's the exit.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.656
Turning safe direction,
stopping traffic.

16:29.690 --> 16:31.458
You can't go park.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.795
I don't know why you keep
driving back to the exit.

16:33.828 --> 16:37.497
Shut the fuck up!
Let's go! Hannah, keep driving.

16:37.531 --> 16:40.333
Daddy. Yes! Press it hander.
I'm sorry.

17:07.061 --> 17:08.662
Here we are, kids.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.431
I don't remember it being so...

17:11.465 --> 17:12.566
Small.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.935
You'd know small.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.470
Alright, Tom Cruise.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.919
All right,
so this is a blitzkrieg.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.922
Like the Nazis?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.892
I mean, no, they didn't invent
the word blitzkrieg.

17:37.925 --> 17:39.493
Yeah, but contextually.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.704
Whatever. It doesn't matter.
We did this

17:40.728 --> 17:42.429
all the time in college.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.865
Nazi shit?

17:43.898 --> 17:46.533
Come on, you take two shots
back to back,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.736
and then you shotgun
your beer as a chaser.

17:48.770 --> 17:51.739
Oh, that sounds just terrible.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.708
Can I mine over there?

17:54.041 --> 17:55.375
Why?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.711
Splash zone, Nick's gonna spew.

17:56.744 --> 17:58.980
I'm not gonna spew. Ew, spew.

17:59.847 --> 18:01.314
I do this all the time.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.383
I guess that's something
to brag about.

18:05.820 --> 18:07.922
Why must you be so cruel?

18:07.955 --> 18:10.057
- Fuck with me.
- Oh, shit.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.035
Ahh.

18:26.107 --> 18:27.975
Whoo!

18:29.744 --> 18:31.913
Oh boy, here we go.

18:33.815 --> 18:35.049
Come on, keep it together.

18:37.752 --> 18:38.786
It's bad.

18:39.020 --> 18:41.555
You called it.

18:48.963 --> 18:50.363
When should we tell him?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.532
Whoa, easy there, <i>chica.</i>

18:52.566 --> 18:55.002
One must approach these
situations with tact,

18:55.036 --> 18:57.905
and you don't have the same
age-old experience

18:57.939 --> 19:00.407
as I do with
these kind of things. So...

19:03.010 --> 19:04.745
Nick, Hannah's gay now.

19:10.885 --> 19:12.385
So how severe is it?

19:12.753 --> 19:14.454
- Nick!
- What? I mean, like,

19:14.487 --> 19:15.756
are you a full-blown lesbian?

19:15.790 --> 19:17.725
Dude, what the f...

19:17.758 --> 19:20.427
- It was just a question.
- A question in jest.

19:21.095 --> 19:22.395
Yeah, I mean...

19:23.430 --> 19:24.732
I think so.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.444
I don't know if I really have
it all figured out yet.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.937
And that's okay,

19:29.971 --> 19:31.581
because you don't have
to have it figured out.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.406
Right? Man.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.820
Didn't this place
use to be cleaner?

19:45.853 --> 19:47.722
What are you talking about?
It's great.

19:49.790 --> 19:51.993
Oh, my god, is that a fucking
heroin needle?

19:56.063 --> 19:57.798
You can't prove that.

19:57.832 --> 19:59.642
I can't prove that?
Jasper, there's an open needle

19:59.666 --> 20:01.936
on the fucking beach,
what else would it be used for?

20:01.969 --> 20:04.205
Okay, everyone just relax.
All right.

20:04.238 --> 20:07.041
Maybe it's just not the same
beach but it's still a beach.

20:07.074 --> 20:09.143
Shh. Hang on. I just came up
with something.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.580
What?

20:13.613 --> 20:15.658
<i>Voice message settings. Please
record your voice message.</i>

20:15.682 --> 20:18.052
Hey, it's Hannah. I got sand
between my cheeks,

20:18.085 --> 20:19.854
so leave a message
after the beep.

20:27.128 --> 20:28.763
What the fuck was that?

20:28.796 --> 20:30.965
"I've got sand between
my cheeks" is probably

20:30.998 --> 20:33.000
the worst thing
that I've ever heard.

20:33.401 --> 20:35.903
- You think it was too much?
- Yes, absolutely too much.

20:35.937 --> 20:37.204
Hannah, that didn't even rhyme.

20:38.706 --> 20:40.174
Yes, it did.

20:40.207 --> 20:42.710
No, no didn't, not at all.

20:42.743 --> 20:45.012
Why are you even recording
a voicemail anyway?

20:45.379 --> 20:47.181
I'm trying to find something

20:47.214 --> 20:48.950
that illustrates
who I am as a person.

20:48.983 --> 20:51.752
I guess "sand between my cheeks"
is a prime descriptor.

20:51.786 --> 20:53.596
Are you trying to tell me
is that who you are right now

20:53.620 --> 20:54.965
is representative
of you are forever.

20:54.989 --> 20:56.690
No. Which is why I try to keep

20:56.724 --> 20:58.793
different representations
of myself up to date.

21:00.127 --> 21:02.029
Sand on the beach.

21:02.063 --> 21:04.198
And apparently heroin. So...

21:05.299 --> 21:06.934
Yeah.

21:06.968 --> 21:10.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, we should do heroin.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.245
Okay, no, so that's less funny.

21:18.279 --> 21:19.914
Yeah, no much, much less funny.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.882
You know what,
maybe it's always sucked here

21:21.916 --> 21:23.117
and we just never noticed.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.986
Oh, yeah.
It really sucks to have

21:25.019 --> 21:28.289
a nice, free beach house
to stay in

21:28.322 --> 21:30.557
and a beautiful beach to go to.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.926
I think we did it.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.995
Yeah, no, no, fuck me, right?

21:34.028 --> 21:35.305
Oh, no, no,
I didn't mean it like that.

21:35.329 --> 21:36.572
I'm kidding.
It totally sucks here.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.698
Yeah, it's all right.

21:38.733 --> 21:40.968
Question is, how are we going
to make this the vacation

21:41.002 --> 21:42.837
that we always thought it was?

21:44.872 --> 21:46.007
Oh, my god.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.576
So fucked, dude.

21:51.178 --> 21:52.847
Whoo!

21:53.214 --> 21:54.815
That was fucking awesome.

21:56.017 --> 21:57.318
What is your problem?

21:57.351 --> 21:58.753
Excuse me?

22:00.121 --> 22:01.789
That was fucking awesome.

22:01.822 --> 22:03.523
I'm the fucking man, okay?

22:10.831 --> 22:12.733
What? You got a problem?

22:12.767 --> 22:14.702
Huh? You gonna
do something, huh?

22:15.102 --> 22:16.102
Huh?

22:16.904 --> 22:18.638
You really can't do shit.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.175
Pussy ass losers.

22:28.449 --> 22:30.985
And that guy's got it all
figured out, dude.

22:31.018 --> 22:32.720
Got what? That he's an asshole?

22:32.753 --> 22:34.630
That guy was so drunk that he
plowed through us,

22:34.654 --> 22:35.956
called us a bunch of pussies

22:35.990 --> 22:37.300
and stepped on
a dirty old beach needle.

22:37.324 --> 22:39.193
How does he have
it all figured out?

22:39.226 --> 22:41.071
Everybody steps on a dirty old
beach needle from time to time.

22:41.095 --> 22:43.764
It's inevitable,
look at the world around us.

22:43.798 --> 22:45.900
I don't know if that's true.

22:45.933 --> 22:48.269
That guy wanted
to have a good time.

22:48.302 --> 22:51.072
With complete disregard
for everybody else around him.

22:51.105 --> 22:53.240
He thought that he was the man,
and in turn made us

22:53.274 --> 22:54.809
think that he was the man.

22:54.842 --> 22:57.011
No, no one thought
that he was the man.

22:57.044 --> 23:00.281
All right, he made us think that
he thought that he was the man.

23:00.314 --> 23:04.752
He exuded confidence and had
but a fantastic time doing so.

23:04.785 --> 23:06.253
What if... what if he's just

23:06.287 --> 23:08.889
some pushover
deadbeat that throws on

23:08.923 --> 23:10.057
this douchebag façade?

23:10.091 --> 23:11.959
We wouldn't even
be able to tell.

23:11.992 --> 23:15.262
So, why don't we pretend to be
those kinds of people, too?

23:15.296 --> 23:17.031
Because we aren't
those kinds of people.

23:17.064 --> 23:18.909
Like Marvin said, we're Nick,
Jasper, and Hannah,

23:18.933 --> 23:20.201
hometown heroes.

23:20.234 --> 23:23.237
Nick, why must you speak
in such a way?

23:23.270 --> 23:25.406
I'm just being considerate
to my future self.

23:25.439 --> 23:26.974
The dude's a douchebag
on vacation

23:27.007 --> 23:28.742
and a douchebag in real life.

23:28.776 --> 23:31.245
Pretending to be
someone I'm not is stupid.

23:31.278 --> 23:33.347
Yeah, but that's what makes it
oh-so-great.

23:33.380 --> 23:35.716
We throw on these
old ruses and schemes

23:35.749 --> 23:36.884
because they're so stupid.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.651
Absolutely not.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.930
Look what happened
at the gas station.

23:39.954 --> 23:41.654
That was fucking stupid.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.258
I'm sorry,
but that was fucking stupid.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.927
And because of that,
Hannah's out of 50 bucks,

23:46.961 --> 23:49.029
and we just look like
a bunch of dipshits.

23:50.331 --> 23:52.299
I don't mean to be all
emo or whatever,

23:52.333 --> 23:55.136
but I just wanted to hang out
with my best friends.

23:55.169 --> 23:56.913
Not the shitty people
they think they have to be

23:56.937 --> 23:58.671
to have a good time.

23:58.706 --> 24:00.350
What, you didn't make any new
friends in college?

24:00.374 --> 24:02.810
Hell yeah I made new friends
in college.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.879
I'll probably never see them
ever again.

24:04.912 --> 24:06.189
The only person going to
grad school with me

24:06.213 --> 24:07.815
is Michael Jackson.

24:07.848 --> 24:09.884
You know a kid named
Michael Jackson?

24:10.317 --> 24:13.220
Yeah. But he can't
dance or sing.

24:13.254 --> 24:15.222
All he ever did
was Jack off all the time.

24:15.256 --> 24:18.893
Point is, doing stupid things
is stupid.

24:21.962 --> 24:25.099
Hey, enough with the eyes.
It's cheating.

24:25.132 --> 24:27.134
Okay, look not to play
devil's advocate.

24:27.168 --> 24:30.304
- Here we go.
- But everything turned out okay.

24:30.337 --> 24:31.872
Mostly.

24:33.407 --> 24:35.075
Of course you're down.

24:35.109 --> 24:37.711
You just want an excuse
to hold Jasper's hand

24:37.745 --> 24:39.246
- and steal shit again.
- No.

24:41.048 --> 24:42.483
Okay, maybe. But look,

24:42.516 --> 24:43.994
when's the next time we're
going to be here?

24:44.018 --> 24:45.352
Why don't we
make the best of it?

24:45.386 --> 24:47.454
Oh, that's cheating.
Totally unfair.

24:47.488 --> 24:49.023
Majority rules.

24:49.056 --> 24:51.458
You have to do it.

24:52.126 --> 24:55.129
Hi, can I get you three
started with something?

24:58.098 --> 25:00.401
Ah. Yes, <i>bonjour.</i>

25:00.434 --> 25:03.170
Ah, your menu, is there
any more pages?

25:04.004 --> 25:05.472
Ah, no.

25:05.506 --> 25:07.208
That's it.

25:07.575 --> 25:09.410
Do you have a baguette?

25:10.377 --> 25:11.879
We have rolls.

25:13.247 --> 25:14.281
Perfect.

25:19.787 --> 25:21.956
Should I get
the shrimp or the steak?

25:22.556 --> 25:24.225
Oh, neither.

25:24.258 --> 25:25.969
We are at the diner.
Why would you order that?

25:25.993 --> 25:27.294
You will get sick and throw up.

25:27.328 --> 25:30.097
I'm not...
I'm not going to get sick.

25:30.130 --> 25:32.399
- You got sick over everything.
- I'm sick of your shit.

25:32.433 --> 25:33.968
Oh, <i>putain.</i>

25:34.001 --> 25:36.403
Madame, do you have
any <i>escargot?</i>

25:39.039 --> 25:40.274
What's going on here?

25:40.307 --> 25:42.243
- I don't have time for this.
- Oh.

25:42.276 --> 25:44.044
Well, I'll be damned.

25:44.078 --> 25:48.082
I pity this menu. I demand
<i>escargot</i> on everything.

25:48.115 --> 25:49.750
I pity this restaurant.

25:50.317 --> 25:51.885
Oh, yeah?

25:51.919 --> 25:54.321
Would you like to tell
that to the chef?

25:55.356 --> 25:56.490
Hey, Clarence.

26:07.601 --> 26:10.237
Well, I'm ready to <i>escargot</i>
the fuck out of here.

26:10.705 --> 26:12.306
<i>Voice message settings.</i>

26:12.339 --> 26:13.974
<i>Please record
your voice message.</i>

26:14.008 --> 26:15.943
Hey, it's Hannah.

26:15.976 --> 26:17.578
Leave a message if feel like it.

26:17.611 --> 26:19.980
Whoa, what is that all about?

26:23.384 --> 26:24.885
Only sometimes.

26:27.354 --> 26:29.423
Where's Jasper?
She's taking forever.

26:29.456 --> 26:30.824
Bathroom.

26:35.863 --> 26:37.398
Can I ask you something?

26:37.431 --> 26:38.899
Absolutely not.

26:40.100 --> 26:43.304
Things aren't gonna be like,
weird or anything. Are they?

26:44.938 --> 26:47.241
What? No, of course not.

26:47.274 --> 26:50.978
I mean, you and jas together,
you know, committed, dating.

26:52.313 --> 26:55.015
We're not like dating,
dating you know.

26:55.049 --> 26:57.051
Like nothing
officially official at least.

26:57.084 --> 26:58.886
It seemed like
you two were a thing.

26:58.919 --> 27:01.522
Well a thing doesn't have
to be anything official, though.

27:01.555 --> 27:04.191
And it's not like we have
time for that, anyways.

27:04.224 --> 27:05.926
Like, we're both so busy.

27:05.959 --> 27:08.395
So busy you can't just like
slap a label on it?

27:11.365 --> 27:13.500
Who's to say.

27:14.034 --> 27:15.936
What do you care, anyway?

27:16.603 --> 27:19.139
- If my friends are dating...
- We're not dating.

27:21.041 --> 27:22.309
I just think it's gonna fuck up

27:22.343 --> 27:24.545
the feng shui
of the whole friendship.

27:24.578 --> 27:26.447
"Feng shui
of the whole friendship."

27:26.480 --> 27:28.549
- Yes. If you're dating...
- We're not dating.

27:28.582 --> 27:30.451
So there can't be
any problems, okay?

27:37.324 --> 27:38.992
It wouldn't be
like a problem anyway

27:39.026 --> 27:40.561
if she wasn't making
it such a thing.

27:40.594 --> 27:43.130
You're ruining the feng shui
with your wickedness.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.331
You are yelling.

27:44.365 --> 27:45.666
You only say it like that

27:45.699 --> 27:46.943
so you pretend like
I won't hear it.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.268
But then you'll act all offended

27:48.302 --> 27:49.346
if I pretend like
I didn't hear you.

27:49.370 --> 27:51.205
Somebody needs to hear it, okay?

27:51.238 --> 27:53.307
I just need her
to grow up, dude.

27:53.340 --> 27:56.076
I'm like,
head over heels for this girl

27:56.110 --> 27:58.545
and I love doing stupid things
with her, but, like...

28:00.114 --> 28:02.416
Emotionally she's just...

28:07.187 --> 28:09.256
I think it's your
own fault for thinking

28:09.289 --> 28:11.358
she's even capable that.

28:11.392 --> 28:14.194
She's been the same since
high school, you know?

28:15.629 --> 28:16.630
Yeah.

28:19.666 --> 28:21.902
Yo, what up, you penises?

28:24.972 --> 28:27.074
All right, so, Hannah,

28:27.107 --> 28:28.651
you're going to come
to the aisle with me,

28:28.675 --> 28:32.279
and Nick. You're going
to pretend to be blind.

28:32.312 --> 28:34.148
Blind? Why am I blind?

28:34.181 --> 28:35.726
Because you got to distract
whoever's working at the counter

28:35.750 --> 28:37.451
while Jasper and I shove
beers in her bag.

28:37.484 --> 28:39.520
You're not paying for them?
I'm not doing this.

28:39.553 --> 28:41.088
Why would we pay for them?

28:41.121 --> 28:42.565
Hey, I don't know
if you've noticed this,

28:42.589 --> 28:45.392
but, um, I'm black.

28:45.426 --> 28:48.128
It's one thing when the
little white girl gets caught

28:48.162 --> 28:49.396
doing something bad,

28:49.430 --> 28:50.998
but when
the black man gets caught...

28:51.632 --> 28:53.333
Nick, we're the same age.

28:55.302 --> 28:58.338
Wow, do you not watch the news?
They don't care.

28:58.372 --> 29:01.275
This is right next to haunted
houses and spiked kombucha

29:01.308 --> 29:03.253
on the white people's
shit shelf. I'm not about it.

29:03.277 --> 29:05.747
You know what? You can stay
here outside,

29:05.780 --> 29:09.717
but if you want to come inside,
you have to pretend to be blind.

29:09.751 --> 29:10.751
Okay?

29:12.519 --> 29:13.922
Come on.

29:14.923 --> 29:18.225
I can pretend to be anyone
I want, but I'm still black.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.148
Ah...

29:42.817 --> 29:44.151
What?

29:44.719 --> 29:47.354
Ah. I'm blind.

29:47.688 --> 29:49.590
How are you today?

29:55.095 --> 29:56.096
Dude, come on.

29:56.129 --> 29:57.765
I'm going. Shut up.

29:57.799 --> 30:00.167
You're not blind. What is this?

30:02.102 --> 30:04.071
What do you want?

30:05.439 --> 30:07.474
You look so cute lifting shop.

30:11.545 --> 30:12.646
What?

30:17.117 --> 30:19.052
- Are they looking?
- I don't know.

30:19.721 --> 30:21.321
- Let me check.
- Okay.

30:28.395 --> 30:31.198
Oh... my god.

30:31.665 --> 30:33.267
- Hi there.
- Hello.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.804
Oh, my god, it is you.
Wait right here.

30:38.372 --> 30:41.108
- It is us.
- Apparently.

30:41.141 --> 30:43.243
Hey! No running in here!

30:46.814 --> 30:49.049
How dare you...

30:50.484 --> 30:52.219
Excuse me?

30:52.252 --> 30:54.555
Accusing me of having
the gift of sight! Incredible.

30:54.588 --> 30:56.223
You're looking right at me!

30:56.256 --> 30:58.826
You're mean right now,
and I didn't do anything.

31:02.797 --> 31:04.732
Oh, my god, it is them.

31:09.636 --> 31:12.472
No, no, no. They're cops.

31:12.506 --> 31:14.608
No! That's them.

31:14.641 --> 31:16.878
That's pocket hot dog.

31:16.911 --> 31:18.645
You guys are incredible.

31:18.679 --> 31:20.782
- I love your music.
- I'm Allison.

31:20.815 --> 31:24.551
- I'm Lindsey.
- And we are pocket hot dog.

31:24.585 --> 31:27.855
- That's so hap!
- The most hap!

31:29.556 --> 31:31.258
- What?
- Where's Angus?

31:31.291 --> 31:32.727
I didn't do anything!

31:32.760 --> 31:34.637
You come into my store
and act as it's your own.

31:34.661 --> 31:36.798
How am I acting like it's...

31:36.831 --> 31:38.599
Hey!

31:38.632 --> 31:40.543
What are you guys doing
back there? Get up here now!

31:40.567 --> 31:41.703
Um...

31:41.936 --> 31:43.604
Can you take this
and meet us outside?

31:44.939 --> 31:47.374
Jas, you can't do that.
What is she gets caught?

31:47.407 --> 31:48.675
That's the point.

31:48.710 --> 31:50.577
- No, you can't...
- Now!

31:51.813 --> 31:54.414
Excuse me!

31:54.448 --> 31:57.417
All I said was "hi"
and you doubted my blindness.

31:57.986 --> 32:01.488
You're not blind, pal.
You tried to steal from me.

32:01.521 --> 32:02.757
How?

32:05.827 --> 32:08.730
Young lady, what's in that bag?

32:08.763 --> 32:10.530
You're being
a massive wiener right now.

32:10.564 --> 32:12.566
Weiner? I'm a massive...

32:12.599 --> 32:14.301
Hey! Hey! Hey!

32:14.601 --> 32:16.236
Open that bag back there!

32:16.269 --> 32:18.906
Hey, brother, it's okay.

32:19.239 --> 32:20.908
Look at you, man!

32:21.441 --> 32:24.378
You got a mop,
dripping all over yourself.

32:24.411 --> 32:25.612
You're a mess.

32:26.948 --> 32:29.917
You don't have to be
here, man. I mean...

32:30.785 --> 32:34.554
We both know that
you don't want to be here.

32:38.225 --> 32:39.593
Huh?

32:40.594 --> 32:42.864
We all got aspirations.

32:43.630 --> 32:47.300
But we're out there
chasing ours.

32:47.601 --> 32:50.437
You. You're here swabbing
the poop deck

32:50.470 --> 32:53.273
on the ship
of someone else's dreams, man.

32:53.741 --> 32:56.376
Don't you wanna be
captain ahab calling the shots,

32:56.410 --> 32:58.245
chasing that white whale?

33:03.684 --> 33:06.921
"There are certain queer times
and occasions

33:06.954 --> 33:10.524
in this strange mixed affair
we call life..."

33:14.829 --> 33:19.599
"When a man
takes the whole universe

33:19.633 --> 33:22.335
for a vast practical joke..."

33:22.369 --> 33:25.338
"Though the wit thereof
he but dimly discerns..."

33:25.372 --> 33:28.776
"And more than suspects
that the joke is at..."

33:28.810 --> 33:30.978
"Is at nobody's expense..."

33:32.546 --> 33:33.881
"But his own."

33:37.284 --> 33:39.619
What in heavenly fuck?

33:44.691 --> 33:46.660
What have I become?

33:52.734 --> 33:54.634
Take whatever you want.

33:55.737 --> 33:57.038
What?

33:57.071 --> 33:59.439
Just leave me
the fucking pretzels.

34:02.509 --> 34:03.811
Dude, that was so cool.

34:04.411 --> 34:06.981
I do what I can
when I do what I do.

34:08.415 --> 34:10.617
What? It doesn't make any sense.

34:10.650 --> 34:13.286
Yeah, makes all the sense, man.

34:14.756 --> 34:15.857
Were you...

34:16.891 --> 34:18.458
Is that Jasper's backpack?

34:19.392 --> 34:22.662
Why does she have your backpack?
Why is she stealing for you?

34:23.097 --> 34:25.967
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, Angus.

34:26.666 --> 34:28.368
Angus?

34:28.401 --> 34:30.004
I'd do anything for you.

34:33.074 --> 34:36.476
- And pocket hot dog.
- Charlie, that was so hap.

34:38.345 --> 34:39.345
Hap?

34:40.647 --> 34:44.351
Oh. That's pretty cool,
it's heavy.

34:44.384 --> 34:47.420
You guys stole a lot
of stuff here.

34:48.856 --> 34:50.925
We really did
save your asses, huh?

34:53.961 --> 34:55.763
That is punk.

34:55.797 --> 34:58.565
Punk is funk, brother.
Punk is funk.

34:59.233 --> 35:01.368
I know what it's like
being on the road.

35:01.401 --> 35:06.040
Money gets tight.
I get it, #vanlife.

35:06.073 --> 35:09.710
That's what pocket hot dog
is all about. Right?

35:13.080 --> 35:16.583
I'm sorry I doubted you,
all right?

35:16.616 --> 35:20.721
I just that I thought
you were narks out to get us.

35:21.889 --> 35:23.490
But here you are!

35:24.491 --> 35:26.611
You can't trust anybody anymore,
you know what I mean?

35:29.730 --> 35:31.698
- I'm Charlie.
- Hey.

35:31.732 --> 35:34.601
I know this is being
forward and all,

35:34.634 --> 35:36.938
but can we take a selfie?

35:36.971 --> 35:38.773
And an autograph?

35:38.806 --> 35:41.042
We're having a little thing
at my place,

35:41.075 --> 35:42.877
not a party or anything.
Just us here folks,

35:42.910 --> 35:46.113
but if you want,
we'd love to have you.

35:46.379 --> 35:49.951
Hang out,
soak up some good vibes...

35:49.984 --> 35:52.887
- It'd be pretty hap.
- What is "hap?" Like hepatitis?

35:52.920 --> 35:55.522
- Where at?
- Right down the road.

35:58.192 --> 36:01.695
Could we talk?
We'll be right back.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.368
What are you doing?

36:09.303 --> 36:11.806
Yeah, I'm not the keenest
on this idea.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.176
Guys, Charlie single-handedly
got us out of that mess.

36:15.209 --> 36:16.911
He's totally cool, we can hang.

36:16.944 --> 36:20.147
They think we're a fucking band,
that's a perfect in.

36:20.380 --> 36:23.751
It seems ridiculous.
Was he quoting Moby dick before?

36:23.784 --> 36:25.619
He was totally
quoting Moby dick.

36:25.987 --> 36:29.156
That guy is a ghost
or a ghoul from 1827

36:29.190 --> 36:31.424
and I'm not fucking with it.

36:31.458 --> 36:34.095
Isn't that why we're doing
what we're doing, though?

36:34.628 --> 36:37.031
Sorry, Jasper. Majority rules.

36:38.165 --> 36:39.699
No ghouls!

36:47.540 --> 36:49.744
No! We talked about this!

36:50.610 --> 36:52.947
Sorry, Nick. Majority rules.

36:53.948 --> 36:55.182
I can't win.

37:08.029 --> 37:09.462
Shit.

37:09.964 --> 37:12.133
- Cool, right?
- Yeah...

37:15.002 --> 37:18.906
Yeah. It's my spirit animal.

37:18.940 --> 37:24.712
Did that myself
after a crazy ayahuasca trip.

37:25.545 --> 37:26.881
You know, I'm a libra.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.219
Yeah. That's cool.

37:32.686 --> 37:34.889
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes! Yes!

37:39.727 --> 37:41.929
Yo, check this out.

37:46.901 --> 37:47.935
What about it?

37:47.969 --> 37:49.602
I know this is pure speculation,

37:49.636 --> 37:51.706
but this dude absolutely
killed his wife

37:51.739 --> 37:54.641
in some ritualistic
heaven's gate kool-aid bullshit.

37:58.012 --> 38:00.715
- That's probably dramatic.
- Look at his face!

38:00.748 --> 38:02.549
Those are the eyes
of a murderer!

38:02.582 --> 38:05.618
- I'm telling you, I've seen it!
- You've seen it?

38:05.652 --> 38:08.521
On those investigative shows
and shit.

38:08.555 --> 38:10.791
You watch too many of those.
I keep telling you that.

38:10.825 --> 38:13.560
And you can't start freaking out
or else I'll freak out.

38:13.593 --> 38:15.763
What about you two?

38:17.597 --> 38:18.597
Drink?

38:19.699 --> 38:21.769
No, thanks. We have beers.

38:26.841 --> 38:28.175
Suit yourselves.

38:31.812 --> 38:34.715
All right!
Let's raise our glasses.

38:36.984 --> 38:41.489
Cheers to an incredible night

38:42.123 --> 38:46.060
with the one and only
pocket hot dog.

38:49.063 --> 38:50.831
Pocket hot dog!

39:14.321 --> 39:16.857
Let me stop you there.

39:21.762 --> 39:23.197
I know.

39:27.001 --> 39:28.235
Know what?

39:31.038 --> 39:34.308
I know you're not
who you're pretending to be.

39:43.017 --> 39:44.684
I'm kidding, man!

39:45.986 --> 39:49.056
You're up on that stage,
you gotta put on

39:49.090 --> 39:53.626
that facade of confidence,
but in the real world you're...

39:54.728 --> 39:55.996
Quiet, subtle.

39:57.298 --> 40:00.134
Nervousness gets
all of us, I get it.

40:01.769 --> 40:05.172
This is an intimate setting.

40:05.206 --> 40:09.076
You're on vacation.
You're not performing.

40:13.247 --> 40:14.681
Yeah?

40:14.715 --> 40:16.026
- Totally.
- Preferably, actually.

40:16.050 --> 40:17.351
That would be totally awesome.

40:17.852 --> 40:20.653
You guys mind if I play you
a little song I wrote?

40:20.687 --> 40:21.956
I don't want to impose.

40:21.989 --> 40:23.891
- Please.
- Go ahead, do your thing.

40:24.959 --> 40:26.327
All right.

40:27.862 --> 40:30.663
Here we go.
This one is called...

40:34.835 --> 40:36.937
"Why do all
the hottest porn stars

40:36.971 --> 40:39.340
do all the weird fetish shit?"

40:44.345 --> 40:46.981

Lunch, brunch, cunt.

41:27.154 --> 41:29.790
I guess
he needed a word that rhymed.

41:31.759 --> 41:35.229
What? That doesn't
even rhyme, Hannah.

41:35.729 --> 41:39.500
Yeah, it does. I hear it.
It sounds similar.

41:39.533 --> 41:41.368
No, it doesn't rhyme.

41:42.503 --> 41:43.904
White people.

42:12.566 --> 42:15.135
I think I'm getting ass tonight.

42:16.537 --> 42:18.272
I'm serious, man.

42:18.305 --> 42:20.474
When has it ever been
this obvious to tell? Watch.

42:20.507 --> 42:22.009
Watch this shit.

42:27.281 --> 42:29.917
I'm gonna eat the Booty
like garbage.

42:31.552 --> 42:33.320
Don't you mean "like groceries?"

42:33.354 --> 42:35.122
No, I'll suck it like garbage.

42:35.155 --> 42:36.890
I'm gonna eat
the Booty like garbage.

42:36.924 --> 42:39.260
No, we get it.
You're disgusting.

42:43.864 --> 42:48.535
<i>We are pocket hot dog.</i>

43:03.884 --> 43:05.886
Eat my pussy!

43:14.461 --> 43:16.130
No, I'm not going in.

43:16.163 --> 43:17.298
Please.

43:17.331 --> 43:18.432
No.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.468
I don't wanna go in the pool.

43:21.502 --> 43:23.137
- Please?
- No.

43:24.338 --> 43:25.539
Come on!

43:30.177 --> 43:31.812
Just for a little bit.

43:34.415 --> 43:36.817
- Come on.
- I don't wanna get wet.

43:37.451 --> 43:39.253
Come on.

43:41.488 --> 43:43.023
- Please?
- No.

43:46.327 --> 43:47.961
Jasper, no, my phone!

44:09.216 --> 44:10.484
I love you.

44:13.654 --> 44:15.389
I love you, too.

44:34.408 --> 44:36.543
Get the fuck out of my house!

44:36.577 --> 44:38.245
I Okay, alright, shit, fuck.

44:39.947 --> 44:43.450
Nick! Get up! Get up! Get up!

44:44.318 --> 44:46.286
I love you! What's going on?

44:46.320 --> 44:48.422
You gotta go!
Gotta go out the back.

44:48.455 --> 44:50.657
Go right out back, there.

44:52.092 --> 44:53.092
Wow.

44:55.429 --> 44:57.264
These ones are young,
even for you.

44:57.297 --> 44:58.465
Don't look at them!

45:01.635 --> 45:03.070
You're the woman
from the picture.

45:03.370 --> 45:05.506
You're the guy
in my fucking house!

45:46.113 --> 45:47.548
That was kind of fucked up.

45:47.581 --> 45:49.483
What happened back there?
That was his wife!

45:49.516 --> 45:52.219
Did you see her face
when she was pointing at you?

45:52.252 --> 45:54.688
"You're the guy
in my fucking house!"

45:57.090 --> 46:00.093
Guys, I'm so sorry.
This was totally my idea.

46:00.127 --> 46:01.695
Oh, I'm pissed!

46:07.234 --> 46:09.636
Somebody do
the Titanic thing with me.

46:19.646 --> 46:21.014
Okay.

46:27.254 --> 46:28.422
Come on!

46:35.362 --> 46:37.231
Oh, what'd I look like?

46:47.574 --> 46:49.576
- Totally hook up with that.
- He's a babe.

46:49.610 --> 46:52.179
Hey! You want date my friend?

46:52.212 --> 46:53.313
Date my friend!

46:53.347 --> 46:54.515
That's not what I want.

46:56.383 --> 47:00.087
- He loves penis!
- That's not what I love at all.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.154
No, hey!

47:02.422 --> 47:03.734
What are you doing
drinking that in here?

47:03.758 --> 47:05.692
You can't drink in the park.

47:05.727 --> 47:07.170
We don't
know what you're talking about.

47:07.194 --> 47:08.371
We're connoisseurs
of good taste.

47:08.395 --> 47:10.097
Oh, yeah.

47:10.130 --> 47:12.432
- My fault. Fuck me, right?
- What about that guy?

47:14.301 --> 47:15.402
Whoo!

47:15.435 --> 47:17.104
And that's a winner.

47:17.137 --> 47:19.106
Isn't that the guy
who called me a pussy loser?

47:19.139 --> 47:21.174
And he's totally
fucking hammered right now.

47:23.711 --> 47:25.312
But he's hot so it's different.

47:25.880 --> 47:30.217
If I can't get hammered
in the park, neither can you.

47:30.250 --> 47:31.618
Get rid of it.

47:34.655 --> 47:37.491
You're a stupid bitch,
don't touch me!

48:07.421 --> 48:08.421
There you go!

48:12.259 --> 48:13.594
Voilà!

48:19.700 --> 48:21.268
Like, I'll punch you
in the face.

48:21.301 --> 48:23.203
- I'll punch you in the face.
- No, no!

48:23.236 --> 48:24.848
- I'll punch you in the face.
- Whoa, hey.

48:24.872 --> 48:26.752
You said you wanted me
to punch you in the face.

48:26.808 --> 48:29.610
Why are we talking about
punching people in the face?

48:29.643 --> 48:32.613
Cause I have a lot
of masculine energy

48:32.646 --> 48:35.717
as a lesbian and I need
to make sure everyone knows

48:35.750 --> 48:37.284
that I'm gay.

48:37.584 --> 48:39.620
I've never
thought of it that way.

48:39.954 --> 48:41.723
No one ever thinks
about lesbians.

48:41.756 --> 48:42.833
They never think about lesbians.

48:42.857 --> 48:44.391
I do, sometimes.

48:44.424 --> 48:46.627
In a cool way or in a weird way?

48:46.660 --> 48:47.762
Um...

48:59.606 --> 49:01.608
We need more booze!

49:01.642 --> 49:03.377
We need more booze!

49:03.410 --> 49:05.312
We need more booze!

49:05.345 --> 49:06.613
Booze!

49:08.983 --> 49:10.550
Let's get more booze.

49:10.584 --> 49:12.319
Let's get more booze.

49:17.391 --> 49:19.226
Enough with the pointing.

49:19.259 --> 49:21.328
Oh. Another victim, guys!

49:22.429 --> 49:24.364
What are we, serial killers?

49:24.398 --> 49:25.933
"Victim" is a strong word.

49:25.967 --> 49:27.300
How would you say it?

49:28.736 --> 49:30.337
You're my victim.

49:30.370 --> 49:31.638
Now I'm just aroused.

49:31.672 --> 49:33.875
- Oh, my god, that's dark!
- What?

49:33.908 --> 49:35.475
"I'm a victim."

49:35.509 --> 49:36.989
- Nick, stop! Ew!
- That's disgusting.

49:40.647 --> 49:42.683
I just had everything replaced.

49:42.717 --> 49:44.284
She's sexy, ain't she?

49:46.253 --> 49:48.588
There's no way this can go well.

49:48.622 --> 49:51.224
It's truly an impossibility.

49:51.491 --> 49:53.627
I just came in this morning
from the city.

49:53.961 --> 49:55.997
Figured today
would be a perfect day

49:56.030 --> 49:58.733
to feel the wind
rip through your hair.

50:02.302 --> 50:04.371
If you think
she's sexy on the outside,

50:04.404 --> 50:06.774
you should really see
what she's like on the inside.

50:07.574 --> 50:09.509
She's got a brand new...

50:12.279 --> 50:15.016
Engine. New sound system, too.

50:15.049 --> 50:17.284
She's just, like,
toyed right now.

50:20.955 --> 50:24.658
- This is your car?
- Howdy it is, dude!

50:24.691 --> 50:26.359
You sure about that?

50:26.393 --> 50:29.229
Because the last time I checked
it was my car.

50:30.865 --> 50:32.834
The Cleveland diesel.

50:34.936 --> 50:37.805
If she's gonna put
all her energy into this bit

50:37.839 --> 50:39.807
it's gonna get stale quick.

50:39.841 --> 50:42.375
I just want a drink!

50:43.811 --> 50:47.715
Did you talk with her yet?
About your feelsies?

50:47.749 --> 50:48.850
Not yet.

50:51.018 --> 50:52.854
I'm gonna to tell her for you.

50:54.387 --> 50:56.690
You can't slip past me!
I'm Cleveland d!

50:56.724 --> 50:58.334
- That's a stupid fucking name.
- What's yours?

50:58.358 --> 50:59.593
- Jasper.
- Casper.

50:59.626 --> 51:01.394
Jasper.

51:01.428 --> 51:03.831
Jasper the friendly joke!
That's a stupid ass name.

51:03.865 --> 51:05.565
Get out of here
with that business!

51:05.599 --> 51:08.035
I sold you this fucking car!
You know what, fuck you!

51:08.069 --> 51:10.872
- There it is.
- Should we do something?

51:11.638 --> 51:12.740
Probably.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.777
I can't be old
and a pussy either.

51:15.810 --> 51:17.879
I thought ugly girls
are supposed to make up

51:17.912 --> 51:19.346
for their looks.

51:19.379 --> 51:20.982
I'm so sorry about that.

51:21.015 --> 51:25.485
She's my brother's
sister's girlfriend.

51:26.453 --> 51:28.956
- Nice.
- Who are these guys?

51:29.623 --> 51:33.027
- Losers. Bunch of losers.
- Exactly.

51:33.060 --> 51:35.730
A bunch of fucking losers.

51:40.534 --> 51:42.636
Enough with the po-

51:42.669 --> 51:44.739
I didn't do anything!

51:44.772 --> 51:46.573
I'm gonna throw up.

52:05.392 --> 52:06.660
You okay?

52:06.693 --> 52:08.428
I should've had
a better comeback!

52:11.431 --> 52:13.000
You're a loser!

52:13.034 --> 52:14.936
Couldn't say that,
I was just pointing at him!

52:14.969 --> 52:16.570
Pointing at his face!

52:17.071 --> 52:18.906
Could've said "you're a loser."

52:18.940 --> 52:21.608
- Is my phone back there?
- No! Froze up!

52:21.641 --> 52:24.712
Froze up!
I'm stronger than that!

52:28.049 --> 52:31.886
- I left it at the house.
- At Charlie's?

52:31.919 --> 52:33.420
Yes, at Charlie's.

52:33.453 --> 52:36.057
Fuck. I don't want
to go back there.

52:36.090 --> 52:38.491
Oh, come on dude.
It wasn't that bad!

52:39.426 --> 52:40.594
It was so bad!

52:44.966 --> 52:46.901
What are you talking about?

53:11.625 --> 53:12.793
I love you.

53:13.294 --> 53:14.862
What's not to like about him?

53:15.595 --> 53:17.464
Okay.

53:17.497 --> 53:20.101
- Can we roll down the windows?
- You're being kind of rude.

53:20.400 --> 53:22.904
Jasper, do you honestly think
he thought we were in some band?

53:22.937 --> 53:24.571
- No!
- Yes, you did!

53:24.604 --> 53:26.774
I didn't,
because he told me last night!

53:38.219 --> 53:39.686
Hey.

54:39.579 --> 54:41.749
- Finding everything on?
- Oh, shit!

54:41.782 --> 54:43.784
That jacket suits you.

54:43.818 --> 54:46.619
It's very... Madonna.

54:47.888 --> 54:50.257
- Dude, I'm so sorry.
- It's all good.

54:50.623 --> 54:51.959
You can keep it.

54:53.294 --> 54:54.527
Is this yours?

54:54.561 --> 54:57.098
Well, it was.

55:02.602 --> 55:06.107
And that right there, see?

55:07.308 --> 55:10.044
That's pocket hot dog.

55:13.748 --> 55:15.615
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:16.717 --> 55:18.651
Dude, I'm so fucking sorry.

55:18.685 --> 55:21.722
You lied about being in a band.

55:21.756 --> 55:23.623
It was my band.

55:26.727 --> 55:29.163
Wait. You guys came up to us.

55:29.196 --> 55:30.931
We did, yeah.

55:32.233 --> 55:34.969
- What was that all about?
- I know.

55:35.002 --> 55:36.837
We did a shitty thing.

55:37.738 --> 55:40.741
I don't know, you guys...

55:40.975 --> 55:44.611
You reminded me of me
and all the crazy, stupid shit

55:44.644 --> 55:46.914
I used to do
when I was your age.

55:48.783 --> 55:52.086
- Sorry, I was dishonest.
- So none of that was real.

55:52.119 --> 55:53.754
You guys thinking
we were somebody else

55:53.788 --> 55:55.165
and the store owner
catching us stealing...

55:55.189 --> 55:59.193
No, the store owner...
That was all real.

55:59.226 --> 56:01.962
I've never seen this dude
before in my life.

56:02.763 --> 56:04.131
So, wait.

56:04.165 --> 56:06.200
You just happen to have
Herman melville

56:06.233 --> 56:08.035
in your pocket all the time?

56:08.069 --> 56:09.303
I'm a man of many wonders.

56:10.371 --> 56:11.839
What?

56:13.107 --> 56:14.909
What's funny?

56:15.743 --> 56:18.045
That's fucking crazy.
That's weird.

56:18.079 --> 56:20.881
It's not crazier
than you pretending

56:20.915 --> 56:24.684
to be somebody you're not.
That's crazy.

56:25.820 --> 56:30.257
We both lied. We're both weird.

56:30.291 --> 56:32.026
Maybe, yeah.

56:32.059 --> 56:33.794
No, entirely.

56:34.295 --> 56:36.797
I just wanna hang out
with like-minded people.

56:36.831 --> 56:38.132
But, um...

56:38.432 --> 56:39.767
What about your wife?

56:39.800 --> 56:42.870
I don't know. She's...

56:46.407 --> 56:48.675
I told her about the whole idea

56:48.709 --> 56:52.746
of going on
this great American road trip,

56:52.780 --> 56:56.016
seeing all the sights,
taking it all in,

56:56.050 --> 56:59.120
meeting like-minded people,

56:59.153 --> 57:04.158
seeing if maybe they wanted
to come along for the journey.

57:04.191 --> 57:07.627
She wasn't too stoked
about that.

57:09.163 --> 57:11.932
That's where those
two girls come to play?

57:11.966 --> 57:14.135
- Allison and Lindsey?
- Yeah.

57:14.902 --> 57:18.139
Yeah, exactly.

57:18.939 --> 57:24.011
We're just lonely people
looking for some connection.

57:24.044 --> 57:25.044
You know?

57:26.981 --> 57:27.981
Yeah.

57:30.084 --> 57:31.084
I know.

57:36.390 --> 57:39.692
He told you last night
and you didn't tell anyone?

57:39.727 --> 57:42.329
You let us sleep there and...

57:45.166 --> 57:46.901
You should've said something.

57:48.002 --> 57:49.803
I'm gonna look for it back here.

57:50.971 --> 57:51.971
Um...

58:25.039 --> 58:26.774
It went to voicemail.

58:42.323 --> 58:43.824
Oh, god.

58:45.926 --> 58:47.361
I knew it would be a mess.

58:47.661 --> 58:51.131
- Allison! Lindsey!
- Relax.

58:53.968 --> 58:55.069
Hey, y'all.

58:55.803 --> 58:57.738
What's going on?

58:58.138 --> 59:00.140
Just a little spat.

59:00.174 --> 59:02.843
- Get the fuck out of my house!
- Shit!

59:02.876 --> 59:04.178
God damn it!

59:07.915 --> 59:10.818
I think I left my phone here.

59:10.851 --> 59:12.920
- You're a piece of shit!
- Charlie!

59:12.953 --> 59:15.256
Oh my god. Charlie?

59:15.289 --> 59:16.423
They call you Charlie?

59:17.224 --> 59:20.828
Who do you think you are,
Charles manson?

59:20.861 --> 59:24.431
His name is ned,
you stupid bimbos!

59:24.465 --> 59:28.535
Hey! Women don't have
to hate other women

59:28.569 --> 59:31.071
when men are at fault.

59:31.105 --> 59:33.240
- Y'all are angels.
- Shut up.

59:33.274 --> 59:36.844
- Charlie!
- What do you want?

59:36.877 --> 59:38.479
What do you want me to do?

59:38.512 --> 59:40.881
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of something?

59:40.914 --> 59:42.483
Right?
I'm in the middle of something.

59:42.516 --> 59:44.952
Go bother somebody else!

59:44.985 --> 59:46.587
You want us to just walk away?

59:46.620 --> 59:49.456
I think that would be
a really good idea right now.

59:49.990 --> 59:53.994
You're an asshole. You're not
who we thought you were.

59:55.629 --> 59:58.232
I'm exactly
what I told you I was!

59:58.265 --> 59:59.533
I'm a revolutionary, man!

59:59.900 --> 1:00:02.102
- Revolutionary?
- Nick!

1:00:02.136 --> 1:00:04.972
Since when is
careening young girls around

1:00:05.005 --> 1:00:07.007
to boost your ego revolutionary?

1:00:09.209 --> 1:00:11.845
Since when is walking out
on a marriage

1:00:11.879 --> 1:00:14.415
for two months to sleep around

1:00:14.448 --> 1:00:17.251
with god knows
how many women revolutionary?

1:00:26.126 --> 1:00:28.195
Um...

1:00:29.163 --> 1:00:32.299
You guys have a car...

1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:35.569
Can I ride with you?

1:00:35.602 --> 1:00:37.638
I'm in something
of a pickle here.

1:00:37.671 --> 1:00:38.972
- Yeah.
- No.

1:00:43.644 --> 1:00:45.179
Are you stupid?

1:00:45.212 --> 1:00:47.214
I'm not letting that guy
into my dad's car.

1:00:47.247 --> 1:00:49.149
I'm not stupid. He needs help.

1:00:49.183 --> 1:00:51.051
Yeah, apparently.

1:00:52.453 --> 1:00:54.421
I'm sorry for that back there.

1:00:54.723 --> 1:00:57.124
Before I never see
you both ever again,

1:00:57.157 --> 1:01:00.194
I just want to come clean
and say that...

1:01:00.227 --> 1:01:04.465
Shh. What you're about
to say... we know.

1:01:04.498 --> 1:01:06.066
Let it go unsaid.

1:01:07.267 --> 1:01:11.405
It's be a shame if the truth we
lived last night were tarnished.

1:01:12.473 --> 1:01:14.208
Goodbye, Angus.

1:01:21.315 --> 1:01:24.251
Oh, my god! You're disgusting!

1:01:25.452 --> 1:01:27.388
I'm sorry!

1:01:30.491 --> 1:01:33.327
You can't just call me stupid
like that. It's not okay.

1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:35.629
Jasper,
I didn't mean it like that.

1:01:35.662 --> 1:01:37.464
So what did you mean it like?

1:01:40.167 --> 1:01:42.069
Can we just go?

1:01:42.102 --> 1:01:45.038
Can we leave all this behind
and just go to the beach house?

1:01:45.072 --> 1:01:46.573
Can you say "I'm sorry?"

1:01:51.178 --> 1:01:52.646
What do you want me to say?

1:01:52.679 --> 1:01:55.082
I want you to say sorry
for calling me stupid.

1:01:55.115 --> 1:01:56.483
You're not stupid.

1:02:00.254 --> 1:02:02.689
You can't say it, can you?
You can't say "I'm sorry."

1:02:02.724 --> 1:02:05.993
- Why can't you say it?
- Why can't you say you love me?

1:02:08.695 --> 1:02:10.431
Wow. Wow.

1:02:10.464 --> 1:02:12.699
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

1:02:12.734 --> 1:02:16.270
I said it in the exact same
geographical location!

1:02:16.303 --> 1:02:19.173
- You were drunk.
- I still meant it!

1:02:20.641 --> 1:02:23.343
Okay. If you meant it,
then say it again.

1:02:24.178 --> 1:02:27.347
For real, if you meant it,
then say it again.

1:02:27.381 --> 1:02:30.284
I'll start. Jasper, I love you.

1:02:33.287 --> 1:02:35.255
- Do you?
- Oh, my god.

1:02:35.757 --> 1:02:38.559
- I heard your voice message.
- What message?

1:02:38.592 --> 1:02:40.160
"It wouldn't be a thing

1:02:40.194 --> 1:02:41.638
if Jasper wasn't making it
such a thing.

1:02:41.662 --> 1:02:43.997
She's been the same
since high school.

1:02:44.031 --> 1:02:46.066
It's your fault for thinking
she'd grow up."

1:02:46.099 --> 1:02:48.135
What the fuck
does that even mean?

1:02:48.168 --> 1:02:51.271
You guys think I'm a kid?
And my favorite one,

1:02:51.305 --> 1:02:52.707
"your problems are gonna ruin

1:02:52.740 --> 1:02:55.275
the feng shui
of our friendship."

1:02:55.309 --> 1:02:57.377
Am I really being
this much of a bother?

1:02:57.411 --> 1:02:59.346
- Jasper, it's not like that.
- What's it like?

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:01.482
What's the hap, cool guys?

1:03:01.515 --> 1:03:04.117
You both called me stupid
and fucking immature.

1:03:04.151 --> 1:03:05.586
What the fuck is up?

1:03:11.558 --> 1:03:14.027
Hannah, you really think
that I don't love you?

1:03:14.061 --> 1:03:15.773
I believe what I said
word for word last night,

1:03:15.797 --> 1:03:17.397
that I fucking love you.

1:03:17.431 --> 1:03:19.231
That was the first time
you ever told me that.

1:03:19.399 --> 1:03:21.068
- No it isn't.
- Hold up!

1:03:21.101 --> 1:03:22.569
No.

1:03:22.603 --> 1:03:24.538
The amount of time
I stick my neck out for you,

1:03:24.571 --> 1:03:27.574
- I fucking follow you around...
- You're your own person!

1:03:27.608 --> 1:03:28.743
I am not your keeper!

1:03:28.776 --> 1:03:31.445
You are so fucking...

1:03:31.478 --> 1:03:33.213
- Stupid?
- Yes!

1:03:33.247 --> 1:03:36.650
You are being stupid!
You are being so stupid, Jasper!

1:03:44.691 --> 1:03:46.126
What are you doing?

1:03:46.159 --> 1:03:47.729
Sorry, Charlie.

1:03:53.433 --> 1:03:55.569
Guys? I think we should go.

1:03:55.602 --> 1:03:57.772
How many times
have we slept together?

1:03:58.171 --> 1:04:00.742
How many times
have we gone out together?

1:04:01.375 --> 1:04:03.745
You told me
that you love me one time.

1:04:04.144 --> 1:04:05.813
That was last night.

1:04:06.580 --> 1:04:08.415
That is what's stupid.

1:04:08.750 --> 1:04:12.486
Sorry, I didn't mean to call
you stupid, dumb, or whatever,

1:04:12.519 --> 1:04:15.389
but you're acting like it.

1:04:17.558 --> 1:04:19.092
If this didn't get
brought up to you,

1:04:19.126 --> 1:04:20.470
you wouldn't have
thought twice about us.

1:04:20.494 --> 1:04:23.096
- Yes I would!
- No, you wouldn't have.

1:04:23.130 --> 1:04:25.432
Because you act like
a fucking child.

1:04:25.465 --> 1:04:26.801
You don't care!

1:04:26.834 --> 1:04:29.503
You fucking deal drugs
to teenagers,

1:04:29.536 --> 1:04:32.272
and you're comfortable doing
nothing with your life, Jasper.

1:04:36.209 --> 1:04:37.320
You think you're fucking
better than me?

1:04:37.344 --> 1:04:38.746
I never said that.

1:04:38.780 --> 1:04:41.816
You live in the same town.
You never left.

1:04:41.849 --> 1:04:43.450
You live off of money
you don't earn!

1:04:43.483 --> 1:04:45.485
Selling money
isn't really earning money!

1:04:45.519 --> 1:04:47.354
But it is, though!

1:04:47.387 --> 1:04:49.265
At least I'm not asking dad for
money when I'm in a tight spot,

1:04:49.289 --> 1:04:52.426
or borrowing his car or going
to his fucking beach house!

1:04:52.961 --> 1:04:55.596
You think you're such
a fucking grown-up,

1:04:55.629 --> 1:04:57.664
but at the end of the day
you're some spoiled brat

1:04:57.698 --> 1:05:00.768
who thinks she's entitled to
anything that comes her way.

1:05:00.802 --> 1:05:04.204
How about we stop all this
because we need to go.

1:05:04.237 --> 1:05:06.373
Nick, shut the fuck up!

1:05:08.776 --> 1:05:10.344
All you've done this
whole vacation

1:05:10.377 --> 1:05:12.145
is fucking complain
and get blackout drunk.

1:05:12.179 --> 1:05:13.614
You want to talk about me?

1:05:13.647 --> 1:05:15.282
I do want
to fucking talk about you.

1:05:15.315 --> 1:05:17.684
Fuck, man! Now you got me
involved in this shit!

1:05:17.719 --> 1:05:19.653
Jasper, fuck that!

1:05:21.455 --> 1:05:23.290
When I'm saying
I'm not about something,

1:05:23.323 --> 1:05:25.692
I'm not making
that decision arbitrarily.

1:05:25.727 --> 1:05:27.895
How do you think it looks
having me running around,

1:05:27.929 --> 1:05:30.230
stealing and scheming and shit?

1:05:30.263 --> 1:05:32.366
I'm not some cute
little white girl, Jasper!

1:05:32.934 --> 1:05:36.403
We're in a fantasy land
full of bright colors and fun,

1:05:36.436 --> 1:05:39.339
but my bounds will always be
narrower than yours.

1:05:39.373 --> 1:05:42.275
Don't guilt me for putting
my wellbeing first.

1:05:43.310 --> 1:05:46.313
This whole vacation I just wanted
to hang out with my friends

1:05:46.346 --> 1:05:48.682
and not do stupid shit
that, like I said before,

1:05:48.716 --> 1:05:51.385
will result in something dumb
like this.

1:05:51.953 --> 1:05:55.656
Excuse me when you two bicker
about your unrequited love.

1:05:56.657 --> 1:05:58.659
Kendra, open the door!

1:05:58.692 --> 1:06:02.596
Fuck me. You guys
never listen to me anyway.

1:06:07.735 --> 1:06:10.470
Guys, just leave me
the fuck alone. Okay?

1:06:30.457 --> 1:06:32.392
So... all right.

1:06:38.733 --> 1:06:41.301
No? All right.

1:06:41.334 --> 1:06:42.870
How about this?

1:06:42.904 --> 1:06:45.940
Why don't we go to the beach
and have some drinks?

1:06:45.973 --> 1:06:50.243
Kick back in the sand,
hang out, chill...

1:06:50.677 --> 1:06:53.547
Vibe, sand... no?

1:06:54.214 --> 1:06:56.984
It's supposed to be beautiful
the rest of the day.

1:07:02.489 --> 1:07:04.691
We're going back
to the beach house.

1:07:12.834 --> 1:07:14.869
Oh, come on!

1:07:21.374 --> 1:07:23.376
Those fucking bitches, dude!

1:07:23.410 --> 1:07:25.312
Calling me immature? Me?

1:07:25.345 --> 1:07:28.482
She still lives with her dad
but I'm the child, right?

1:07:30.317 --> 1:07:33.788
Best friends, dude,
we were best fucking friends.

1:07:33.821 --> 1:07:37.357
And Nick?
Don't even get me started, man.

1:07:37.390 --> 1:07:39.626
It's not like
we forced him to do anything!

1:07:39.659 --> 1:07:40.995
We're a bunch of shit heads.

1:07:41.028 --> 1:07:42.072
I don't understand
why everything has to be

1:07:42.096 --> 1:07:43.630
so fucking serious all the time.

1:07:44.198 --> 1:07:46.901
Despite my marriage
falling apart

1:07:46.934 --> 1:07:50.637
and my only travel companions
seeing me as a piece of shit

1:07:50.670 --> 1:07:53.540
and my wife, soon to be ex,
burning all my things,

1:07:53.573 --> 1:07:55.642
including but not limited to

1:07:55.675 --> 1:07:58.545
the last 20 years of my life
in photos that tmz

1:07:58.578 --> 1:08:00.514
will no longer have access to

1:08:00.547 --> 1:08:03.583
when my inevitable
rise to infamy

1:08:03.617 --> 1:08:05.820
results in my
inevitable downfall

1:08:05.853 --> 1:08:09.824
because of drug usage
and the mental strain

1:08:09.857 --> 1:08:11.993
of celebrity status!

1:08:13.895 --> 1:08:17.932
Yeah! Your fucking friends, man.
They screwed you. They suck.

1:08:17.965 --> 1:08:21.068
I didn't cause your life
to implode on itself,

1:08:21.102 --> 1:08:22.970
- you did that.
- Thank you!

1:08:23.436 --> 1:08:25.539
- What?
- I'm just saying

1:08:25.572 --> 1:08:28.810
that you could be a little more
sensitive to my situation.

1:08:29.342 --> 1:08:31.946
- Your situation?
- Yeah, my situation.

1:08:31.979 --> 1:08:35.850
- You cheated on your wife!
- No, I did not.

1:08:35.883 --> 1:08:38.318
Well, she thinks you did.

1:08:40.855 --> 1:08:42.857
Okay. But only a little.

1:08:43.191 --> 1:08:44.859
Only a little?

1:08:44.892 --> 1:08:46.828
Do you ever take responsibility
for your actions?

1:08:46.861 --> 1:08:49.764
- Do you?
- Fuck, yes, I do!

1:08:50.697 --> 1:08:51.732
God!

1:08:52.867 --> 1:08:54.501
Don't give me that look, ned!

1:08:55.236 --> 1:08:58.105
I take responsibility
for my own bullshit.

1:08:58.139 --> 1:09:01.575
- I know when I'm wrong!
- Then where are your friends?

1:09:02.777 --> 1:09:04.477
Why aren't they here?

1:09:08.548 --> 1:09:11.018
'Cause I know where my wife is.

1:09:11.052 --> 1:09:14.956
She's back home probably
either laughing wildly

1:09:14.989 --> 1:09:19.026
at my burned things
or she's inside,

1:09:21.128 --> 1:09:23.064
alone and crying...

1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:27.802
Because of me.

1:09:32.974 --> 1:09:34.641
What are you gonna do?

1:09:42.449 --> 1:09:43.918
I don't know, man.

1:09:44.551 --> 1:09:48.555
Maybe I'll take that trip,
see the world,

1:09:48.588 --> 1:09:50.958
find those like-minded people,
you know?

1:09:51.424 --> 1:09:54.128
Wait, you're not
gonna go back to her?

1:09:56.030 --> 1:09:57.564
You're such an asshole!

1:09:57.597 --> 1:09:59.599
You have to go back
and say something!

1:09:59.633 --> 1:10:02.937
You didn't say
something to what's-her-name.

1:10:02.970 --> 1:10:04.671
- Hannah.
- Hannah, right.

1:10:04.705 --> 1:10:06.073
You didn't say something to her.

1:10:06.107 --> 1:10:08.175
You're being
a little hypocritical right now.

1:10:08.209 --> 1:10:11.578
No one is asking you, okay?
It's different.

1:10:11.846 --> 1:10:12.947
How?

1:10:13.446 --> 1:10:16.650
You were married, Charlie.
Married!

1:10:16.683 --> 1:10:19.186
We weren't even together.
We weren't even official!

1:10:21.655 --> 1:10:23.724
Wouldn't they think
that's your fault?

1:10:23.758 --> 1:10:26.060
No! It's not my fault!

1:10:26.093 --> 1:10:28.863
I shouldn't be forced
to be something that I'm not!

1:10:30.865 --> 1:10:34.101
The whole label thing,
I just can't do it.

1:10:34.135 --> 1:10:38.239
You put a label on.
You have to go and fix it!

1:10:38.272 --> 1:10:41.574
In what scenario does someone
repeatedly break someone's heart

1:10:41.608 --> 1:10:43.945
and still end up together
and happy?

1:10:43.978 --> 1:10:45.478
Like nothing ever happened,

1:10:45.512 --> 1:10:46.914
like all is right
with the world?

1:10:46.948 --> 1:10:48.682
You're not even gonna try?

1:10:55.256 --> 1:10:56.656
Nope.

1:10:57.925 --> 1:10:59.226
Charlie, she cried
for you, dude.

1:10:59.260 --> 1:11:02.129
And she lit my stuff on fire!

1:11:02.163 --> 1:11:05.232
Passionately! She set
the fire ablaze with a passion!

1:11:05.266 --> 1:11:06.834
Come on!

1:11:06.867 --> 1:11:08.387
Imma set this bowl ablaze
with passion.

1:11:15.977 --> 1:11:17.912
Resin. Oh.

1:11:17.945 --> 1:11:20.181
Fuck.

1:11:20.214 --> 1:11:22.783
Look, as it stands,

1:11:22.817 --> 1:11:25.186
we're both stuck here,

1:11:25.219 --> 1:11:27.755
eating this poop sandwich

1:11:27.788 --> 1:11:30.858
we so beautifully prepared
for ourselves.

1:11:30.891 --> 1:11:33.894
- Poop sandwich?
- Let's just hang out!

1:11:34.462 --> 1:11:38.866
We can get stoned
and hit the road.

1:11:38.899 --> 1:11:40.968
Take that
big American road trip,

1:11:41.002 --> 1:11:43.503
go find
those like-minded people.

1:11:44.705 --> 1:11:46.539
Kinda like us.

1:11:46.573 --> 1:11:49.542
You know Charlie, I don't think
we're very like-minded.

1:11:49.576 --> 1:11:52.813
You're just standing here
smoking dirty resin.

1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:55.116
You can't even
face yourself, man.

1:11:56.751 --> 1:11:59.220
You lied your way into my home
last night

1:11:59.253 --> 1:12:01.188
because you weren't happy
with who you were.

1:12:01.222 --> 1:12:04.258
- That's not true.
- Then what was it?

1:12:04.524 --> 1:12:08.896
People who like themselves don't
pretend to be other people.

1:12:11.766 --> 1:12:14.101
Don't act
like we're any different.

1:12:14.135 --> 1:12:17.604
You run away from your problems,
and so do I.

1:12:21.742 --> 1:12:23.177
Well, not anymore.

1:12:24.145 --> 1:12:26.113
Oh, come on now!

1:12:26.714 --> 1:12:27.714
At least...

1:12:29.250 --> 1:12:31.318
At least take my number.

1:12:42.797 --> 1:12:47.201
Here. Hold that for a second.

1:12:48.668 --> 1:12:51.604
Oh, sweet, sweet resin.

1:13:02.950 --> 1:13:03.951
There you go.

1:13:08.889 --> 1:13:13.094
Shoot me a call
if you change your mind.

1:13:15.229 --> 1:13:16.696
I won't.

1:13:19.366 --> 1:13:21.335
You won't call me
or won't change your mind?

1:13:21.368 --> 1:13:23.670
- Both. Neither.
- What?

1:13:23.703 --> 1:13:25.172
Whatever I want.

1:13:39.186 --> 1:13:42.056
- Hannah, pull over!
- What?

1:13:42.923 --> 1:13:44.959
I'm gonna throw up.

1:13:45.292 --> 1:13:48.028
I don't wanna throw up
in the dadillac. Pull over!

1:13:48.062 --> 1:13:50.297
- Okay, shit.
- Pull over!

1:14:16.924 --> 1:14:18.359
Is that my phone?

1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:22.695
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

1:14:30.738 --> 1:14:32.339
No one.

1:14:32.373 --> 1:14:35.009
What do you mean, "no one?"
It's my phone. Who was it?

1:14:37.745 --> 1:14:39.246
It was your mom.

1:14:45.819 --> 1:14:48.122
She's the worst.

1:14:48.155 --> 1:14:50.291
She's your mom.
Why is she the worst?

1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:56.197
She forces me to pay for college
and apparently

1:14:56.230 --> 1:14:58.265
I'm up to my cheeks in bills
I can't pay

1:14:58.299 --> 1:15:01.701
that I didn't ask for.
It's not what I wanna do.

1:15:02.269 --> 1:15:03.971
What do you wanna do?

1:15:04.572 --> 1:15:07.875
I don't know.
I need time to figure it out.

1:15:08.275 --> 1:15:10.344
Isn't that what college is for?

1:15:14.815 --> 1:15:16.283
It's gonna pay off.

1:15:16.517 --> 1:15:19.220
You're going to grad school.
That's like an immediate job.

1:15:19.253 --> 1:15:22.289
I don't wanna go to grad school,
degrees don't mean shit.

1:15:22.323 --> 1:15:24.825
Don't be an idiot.
To some people they do.

1:15:27.061 --> 1:15:29.430
Why didn't you go?
You could've went.

1:15:30.397 --> 1:15:32.132
I didn't want to.

1:15:32.166 --> 1:15:35.236
Then don't call me an idiot
for not wanting to go.

1:15:36.003 --> 1:15:37.071
Right.

1:15:42.943 --> 1:15:45.946
Did you not want to go
because of Jasper?

1:15:49.350 --> 1:15:52.019
I didn't go because nobody
forced me to go.

1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:55.122
Nobody knew better than me.

1:15:55.656 --> 1:15:58.959
At least nobody posed themselves
to know better than me.

1:16:04.064 --> 1:16:05.199
You good?

1:16:06.467 --> 1:16:07.968
I hope.

1:16:16.043 --> 1:16:18.312
- You gotta hold it.
- Thank you, I know.

1:16:18.345 --> 1:16:19.913
I'm holding it.

1:18:10.624 --> 1:18:12.626
<i>Please leave your message for...</i>

1:18:12.659 --> 1:18:14.395
<i>Hey, it's Hannah.</i>

1:18:14.763 --> 1:18:16.964
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1:18:18.265 --> 1:18:19.299
<i>Stupid.</i>

1:18:56.470 --> 1:18:58.172
Oh. Oh.

1:19:04.779 --> 1:19:06.980
Ah. Okay.

1:19:07.014 --> 1:19:08.549
Tried and true. Tried and true.

1:19:13.687 --> 1:19:14.955
Oh!

1:19:16.290 --> 1:19:17.424
Oh!

1:19:17.458 --> 1:19:18.992
Oh, fuck!

1:19:19.026 --> 1:19:20.026
Oh, fuck!

1:19:22.296 --> 1:19:24.364
Jasper! What the fuck was that?

1:19:24.766 --> 1:19:26.533
I didn't think
that would happen!

1:19:26.567 --> 1:19:28.602
They do it all the time
in the movies!

1:19:28.635 --> 1:19:31.438
I'm so sorry!

1:19:31.472 --> 1:19:33.974
- That sucks!
- What are you doing here?

1:19:35.142 --> 1:19:37.077
I don't know, man.

1:19:37.311 --> 1:19:39.513
I know that I really
wanna talk to you.

1:19:40.681 --> 1:19:43.083
We came here together, right?

1:19:46.487 --> 1:19:49.423
- Do you wanna come in?
- Obviously!

1:20:01.568 --> 1:20:02.703
Hey.

1:20:04.671 --> 1:20:06.306
Hi.

1:20:42.710 --> 1:20:44.511
Hannah, I'm really sorry.

1:20:49.717 --> 1:20:51.351
I'm sorry.

1:20:51.853 --> 1:20:54.254
I shouldn't have
called you names.

1:20:55.723 --> 1:20:58.292
I should've told you
that I loved you more.

1:20:58.692 --> 1:21:00.561
So let me give you...

1:21:04.799 --> 1:21:07.167
You know everything
is gonna be fine, right?

1:21:08.702 --> 1:21:12.472
I don't know if things can go
back to the way they were,

1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:16.443
but if they can,
I really hope that they do.

1:21:30.257 --> 1:21:31.525
And if they can't?

1:21:58.786 --> 1:22:01.288
Should I get
the shrimp or the steak?

1:22:01.321 --> 1:22:03.825
Enough with the shrimp or
the steak thing! It's morning.

1:22:03.858 --> 1:22:05.626
You gonna
catch salmonella, dude.

1:22:05.659 --> 1:22:07.795
You don't catch salmonella,
it's not like the flu.

1:22:07.829 --> 1:22:10.364
You're gonna get
salmonella, then.

1:22:11.733 --> 1:22:14.836
Why? Why, Jasper?

1:22:14.869 --> 1:22:17.204
You know exactly why.

1:22:18.372 --> 1:22:20.641
How is everyone this morning?

1:22:22.476 --> 1:22:24.211
Oh, god...

1:22:24.244 --> 1:22:26.246
Hello, love! I was wondering

1:22:26.279 --> 1:22:27.858
what your favorite thing
on the menu was.

1:22:27.882 --> 1:22:30.752
Great!
The funny people are back.

1:22:30.785 --> 1:22:32.519
Can I get the sea biscuit?

1:22:32.552 --> 1:22:34.187
Seabiscuit's a horse!

1:22:34.221 --> 1:22:34.922
They serve horse here?

1:22:34.956 --> 1:22:36.223
Yeah!

1:22:37.925 --> 1:22:40.694
Can I get 14 hot dogs?

1:22:47.969 --> 1:22:50.905
Do you ever wonder how things
are gonna turn out for us?

1:22:50.938 --> 1:22:53.540
If we're making
the right choices or not?

1:22:53.573 --> 1:22:56.376
How you made a choice
to order fish at a diner?

1:22:56.410 --> 1:22:58.980
Or how you made the choice
to get food poisoning?

1:22:59.013 --> 1:23:00.782
Or how you two decided
to be dicks to me

1:23:00.815 --> 1:23:01.615
and I could steal the dadillac

1:23:01.648 --> 1:23:02.968
and leave your asses
here forever.

1:23:03.918 --> 1:23:05.853
- You wouldn't do that.
- Big talk.

1:23:05.887 --> 1:23:07.722
Seriously.

1:23:07.755 --> 1:23:09.489
Do you ever think we'll know

1:23:09.523 --> 1:23:11.625
if we're making
the right choices or not?

1:23:32.013 --> 1:23:33.246
No.

1:23:48.896 --> 1:23:51.431
Dude! You've got
a long enough joint?

1:23:51.465 --> 1:23:52.934
Don't smoke weed in the car!

1:23:53.567 --> 1:23:54.668
Don't...!

1:24:45.887 --> 1:24:48.288
Oh, I wanna smoke, you guys.

1:24:49.090 --> 1:24:52.359
The one with
the long legs usually wins.

1:24:52.392 --> 1:24:53.560
- Yeah?
- That's me.

1:24:53.593 --> 1:24:55.395
Prove it!

1:24:55.428 --> 1:24:58.632
Guys, I think you're
going too fast for the slow mo.

1:24:58.665 --> 1:25:01.334
Maybe you guys should slow down.

1:25:01.368 --> 1:25:03.670
I'm just using my leg extenders.

1:25:03.703 --> 1:25:05.405
Yes!

1:25:05.438 --> 1:25:07.108
She's in the lead!

1:25:07.141 --> 1:25:08.876
They fell for her fucking trick!

1:25:08.910 --> 1:25:11.411
- No!
- They're such idiots!

1:25:11.444 --> 1:25:13.547
What up, bitch!

1:25:13.580 --> 1:25:14.849
In overdrive, now.

1:25:14.882 --> 1:25:17.317
Daddy long legs.

1:25:17.985 --> 1:25:20.520
That should be
your porn name or something.
