WEBVTT

00:03.711 --> 00:06.010
I'm having a difficult time
figuring out what's real.

00:06.181 --> 00:08.843
You never left, Sam.
You're still in the cage. With me.

00:09.017 --> 00:11.679
Your hand. I was with you
when you cut it, I sewed it up.

00:11.853 --> 00:13.684
This is real.

00:13.855 --> 00:16.323
I'm a grade-A freak,
but I'm managing it.

00:16.491 --> 00:18.721
- There was a job in town.
- Where's the body?

00:18.894 --> 00:20.054
- I let her go.
- Why?

00:20.228 --> 00:22.788
You know me.
You know the kind of person I am.

00:23.298 --> 00:25.823
She's dropping bodies,
which means we gotta drop her.

00:26.001 --> 00:28.231
She killed her own mom to save me.

00:28.937 --> 00:32.031
- I'm sorry, but it's that simple.
- She's done. Trust me.

00:33.675 --> 00:34.869
Dean, please.

00:35.177 --> 00:36.872
Okay.

00:37.312 --> 00:38.677
You are what you are.

00:38.847 --> 00:40.178
You will kill again.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.808
I'm sorry.

01:15.484 --> 01:16.576
That's impossible.

01:43.912 --> 01:45.573
You're okay, you're okay.

01:46.948 --> 01:48.609
You're okay.

01:57.192 --> 01:58.625
No!

02:06.101 --> 02:08.193
Standing outside
the building where tragedy...

02:14.809 --> 02:16.276
No idea...

02:16.444 --> 02:18.674
<i>Sam.</i>

02:21.683 --> 02:23.674
Feels wonky.

02:24.619 --> 02:26.052
What?

02:26.421 --> 02:28.981
Working a regularjob.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.319
Bobby will call if anything flares up
on the Leviathan front.

02:32.494 --> 02:34.792
Meantime,
you know you wanna work this case.

02:34.963 --> 02:36.396
Cop on the wire
sounded dumbfounded.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.396
Pfft. No arguments.

02:38.567 --> 02:41.195
It's kind of nice.
We're due for a little cut-and-dry.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.427
And, uh...

02:44.539 --> 02:46.166
And you seem good.

02:46.341 --> 02:47.831
I am. For me.

02:48.009 --> 02:50.637
By the way, thank you.

02:51.179 --> 02:53.204
- For?
- Amy.

02:54.082 --> 02:57.540
You didn't wanna let her go,
but it was the right thing to do. Thanks.

02:58.086 --> 02:59.713
No problem.

03:10.332 --> 03:13.165
Welcome to Crazytown.
Population, one dead guy.

03:14.035 --> 03:15.366
Who was he?

03:15.537 --> 03:16.936
Uh...

03:17.205 --> 03:20.106
Matthew Hammond.
Seems to have been crushed to death.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.710
- By?
- If we weren't on the 10th floor...

03:22.877 --> 03:25.004
...I'd say by a car.

03:34.122 --> 03:37.091
- Oh, there you are. Yeah.
- I'll be right back. Got it.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.019
It's going crazy.

03:40.195 --> 03:41.628
Some kind of ghost?

03:41.796 --> 03:43.787
With a license?

03:44.199 --> 03:46.429
License to kill.

03:46.735 --> 03:48.259
Seriously?

03:50.538 --> 03:52.096
Huh.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.935
What have you got?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.271
I don't know.
Looks like some kind of powder.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.743
- Sulfur?
- No. Just dirt.

04:00.882 --> 04:03.146
<i>- Could be Christine-like.
- Yeah.</i>

04:03.318 --> 04:06.913
Even possessed cars can't do stairs.
It's something spectral.

04:09.057 --> 04:10.718
Check this out.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.287
AA, 10 years.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.723
Dead and sober.

04:15.563 --> 04:17.497
- Double crappy.
- There's a, uh...

04:17.666 --> 04:18.963
...charge that keeps coming up.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.466
Fifty bucks a month
at a place called Jane's.

04:22.437 --> 04:23.665
All right. Ahem.

04:23.838 --> 04:26.466
Congrats on your sobriety.
I'll go find out what Jane's is.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.405
Heh, I, uh... I gave up AA for Lent.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.676
We're not Catholic.

04:31.846 --> 04:33.507
Always with the details.

04:33.682 --> 04:36.947
- AA gives me the jeebs.
- Wow, shocker.

04:37.118 --> 04:39.018
- Shut up.
- Fine.

04:39.187 --> 04:41.155
I'll hit the meeting,
you go hit on Jane.

04:43.458 --> 04:47.189
Matt was a nice guy.
Kind of a tortured soul.

04:47.362 --> 04:51.355
Join the club. But he just seemed
to have a lot going on, you know?

04:51.566 --> 04:52.965
Any idea what it was?

04:53.134 --> 04:54.294
Family, a girl?

04:54.469 --> 04:57.097
He played it all
pretty close to the vest.

04:57.272 --> 04:59.604
Something was eating at him,
last time I saw him.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.634
- Almost slipped.
- When?

05:01.810 --> 05:03.368
Just before he died, I guess.

05:03.578 --> 05:06.513
He called me from Neal's Tavern.
An inch away from drinking.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.149
So I ran over,
talked him off the ledge.

05:09.317 --> 05:11.683
- Know what triggered it?
- He didn't share much.

05:17.959 --> 05:19.324
Hey.

05:19.794 --> 05:21.557
May I help you?

05:21.730 --> 05:25.325
Uh, yes. I, uh, had a few questions
about a customer of yours.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.799
- Name of Matthew Hammond.
- Uh, sure. He's not in trouble, is he?

05:30.105 --> 05:32.005
Mr. Hammond is no longer with us.

05:33.007 --> 05:34.235
Oh.

05:34.409 --> 05:36.969
- Well, now it all makes sense.
- What does?

05:37.145 --> 05:40.342
He came in, a couple of days ago,
paid me three years in advance...

05:40.515 --> 05:43.006
...to keep delivery going.
Where do the flowers go?

05:43.752 --> 05:45.185
A Miss Elizabeth Duren.

05:45.754 --> 05:47.813
You mind writing Elizabeth's address
down?

05:47.989 --> 05:50.014
I'd like to pay her a visit.

06:04.672 --> 06:06.401
Here we go.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.871
- Meet Elizabeth Duren.
- Died at 10.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.546
Wow.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.141
- So who was she?
- I don't know.

06:17.218 --> 06:19.743
Well,
we'll chew on it back at the motel.

06:23.958 --> 06:27.621
Elizabeth Duren. Killed 10 years ago.
A neighbor backed out of his driveway.

06:27.796 --> 06:28.888
Didn't see her bike.

06:29.063 --> 06:31.293
No one was ever charged.
Police ruled it an accident.

06:31.466 --> 06:34.731
Let me guess. The neighbor
is our 10th floor pancake.

06:35.670 --> 06:38.070
At least we know he felt bad.
I mean, the flowers.

06:38.239 --> 06:41.572
Kind of makes you wonder if the guy
wasn't drunk when he ran her over.

06:43.912 --> 06:45.379
Yeah.

06:45.747 --> 06:47.715
All right, well, regardless.

06:47.882 --> 06:50.407
Now that we got a decent bead
on Ghost Rider...

06:50.585 --> 06:52.553
...let's go.
What?

06:53.955 --> 06:57.482
Burn her bones. Put her to rest.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.292
The fun never stops.

07:29.257 --> 07:31.817
Keep that thing away from me!

07:40.435 --> 07:41.959
All right.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.639
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

07:45.807 --> 07:47.775
I need help.
There's a dog after me.

07:47.942 --> 07:49.603
<i>- What is your address?
- I don't know.</i>

07:50.111 --> 07:51.373
Some restaurant somewhere...

07:52.780 --> 07:54.042
<i>Sir?</i>

07:54.549 --> 07:55.880
<i>Sir?</i>

07:56.050 --> 07:57.142
<i>Hello?</i>

07:57.485 --> 07:58.975
<i>Hello, sir, can you hear me?</i>

08:01.956 --> 08:03.821
No! No! Agh!

08:04.559 --> 08:07.460
<i>Sir, you need to calm down.
We'll send paramedics.</i>

08:07.629 --> 08:09.290
<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

08:09.464 --> 08:11.193
<i>Sir? Sir?</i>

08:15.770 --> 08:18.967
Unh, another night at the office.
You take the first shower.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.198
Listen to this.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.242
"A local man, Christopher Fisher,
was ripped to shreds...

08:23.411 --> 08:27.142
...in a wild animal attack last night."
It is a dangerous world out there.

08:29.017 --> 08:30.985
He was in the restroom of a diner.

08:31.152 --> 08:32.176
That doesn't sound right.

08:32.352 --> 08:34.878
Apparently, uh,
none of the patrons saw anything.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.025
Guy calls 911,
screaming about a dog...

08:38.192 --> 08:40.490
...but the operator didn't hear anything
either.

08:40.662 --> 08:42.789
Wow. Looks like this guy
had a history with dogs.

08:43.563 --> 08:45.725
- Meaning?
- Five years ago, he was arrested...

08:45.900 --> 08:49.199
...for running a dogfighting operation.
Classy.

08:49.370 --> 08:53.932
So what? He causes so much misery
that some Rottweiler goes Cujo on him...

08:54.108 --> 08:55.905
...from beyond the grave?

08:57.111 --> 08:59.875
Wait a second.
Do dogs even have ghosts?

09:00.048 --> 09:02.573
- First I've heard of it.
- Sounds weird. A ghost dog?

09:02.750 --> 09:06.242
- No weirder than ghost car, you know?
- You know what does make sense?

09:06.421 --> 09:08.252
Vengeance on the guy
that Michael Vicked you.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.722
I'm no one to judge, but sounds to me
like that guy had it coming.

09:12.026 --> 09:13.516
Maybe.

09:14.562 --> 09:15.859
But maybe not.

09:16.030 --> 09:19.557
He got busted, got probation, started
volunteering at an animal shelter.

09:19.734 --> 09:21.099
- Because he had to.
- At first.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.237
But he kept going,
long after he served his time.

09:23.404 --> 09:26.464
Looks like he got really into it.
Raised money for the cause.

09:28.242 --> 09:29.368
- Huh.
- People change.

09:29.544 --> 09:31.273
Tell that to ghost dog.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.772
All right.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.645
Get suited up.

09:37.852 --> 09:39.717
- Let's go check out the body.
- What?

09:40.355 --> 09:41.617
- What?
- What? What?

09:41.923 --> 09:43.652
Nothing. L...

09:43.992 --> 09:46.256
- You okay?
- Peachy.

09:46.661 --> 09:49.653
Yeah. Let's do this.

09:51.099 --> 09:53.431
So guess what I found.

09:53.601 --> 09:55.660
Red dirt under his nails.
On his shoes too.

09:55.870 --> 09:57.735
Just like the, uh,
car crash guy's floor.

09:57.905 --> 10:00.874
Yeah. So gotta be someplace here
they both walked.

10:02.010 --> 10:05.138
- An apple farm?
- Apparently, whatever is in red dirt...

10:05.313 --> 10:09.010
...makes great apples.
- I'd be interested in that if I ate apples.

10:10.451 --> 10:13.249
So this one is supposedly pretty old,
uh, mostly abandoned.

10:13.421 --> 10:15.184
- A few hundred acres.
- A few hundred?

10:16.391 --> 10:18.621
We're gonna be searching all year.

10:19.694 --> 10:21.161
Whoa.

10:28.703 --> 10:30.261
Hey, uh...

10:30.905 --> 10:34.136
- You okay?
- Guy just jumped in front of a car, Sam.

10:34.308 --> 10:35.775
Uh, you want us to help you, sir?

10:38.279 --> 10:41.544
Why don't we get you out of here
before you get roadkilled, huh?

10:41.716 --> 10:43.206
Yeah.

10:47.455 --> 10:49.355
Warren, just, uh, take a minute...

10:49.524 --> 10:51.185
...and tell us what's going on.

10:53.661 --> 10:55.629
Look, you're good people,
I can see that.

10:55.930 --> 10:58.558
But you can't do anything for me.
No one can.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.361
- Why not?
- Because it's all impossible.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.663
- You won't even believe me.
- Well, try us.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.669
I was just put on trial,
sentenced to death.

11:10.011 --> 11:11.842
- What did you do?
- Held up a liquor store.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.381
I killed the owner and his wife.
I wasn't thinking.

11:15.550 --> 11:16.812
- I was young.
- Young?

11:16.984 --> 11:18.508
- When was this?
- 1981.

11:19.153 --> 11:22.054
- They just put you on trial?
- No. I just got out of prison.

11:22.490 --> 11:24.219
You're making less sense
the more you talk.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.020
It's okay. Just go on.

11:28.529 --> 11:31.396
Did 30 years. I just got paroled.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.192
Not that you're ever free of that.
I think about it every day.

11:35.903 --> 11:40.203
- So then what were you running from?
- I told you. The trial.

11:40.374 --> 11:43.537
All I know is one minute I'm at the bar,
the next, I get jumped.

11:43.711 --> 11:45.372
Wake up in a damn courtroom.

11:45.546 --> 11:48.447
Courtroom? Like a courtroom?

11:48.616 --> 11:50.174
Well, no. There was ajudge.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.219
Everything was crazy.
It was in a barn.

11:53.387 --> 11:54.718
- At the apple farm?
- Yeah.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.924
- And this bar where you were grabbed?
- Neal's Tavern.

12:01.195 --> 12:05.757
Same place Matthew Hammond went
before his, uh, car accident.

12:06.134 --> 12:08.625
Think maybe dog guy went there too?

12:08.803 --> 12:11.533
- Is there anything else you can tell us?
- You believe me?

12:12.640 --> 12:13.800
Who the hell are you?

12:14.242 --> 12:16.267
We kind of specialize in crazy.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.442
So, uh, this judge, he got a name?

12:20.014 --> 12:22.107
- There were these weird symbols.
- Symbols?

12:22.650 --> 12:25.619
Do you remember any of them?
Can you draw them?

12:30.525 --> 12:31.583
Excuse us a second.

12:32.093 --> 12:34.061
Can I talk to you?

12:42.336 --> 12:45.328
- What is it?
- What is it? Sam, um, heh.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.838
A drunk driver, Michael Vick,
a murderer?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.068
- And?
- And?

12:50.244 --> 12:52.576
When did our black-and-white case
turn to mud?

12:52.747 --> 12:55.011
I'm having a hard time not rooting
for the ghosts.

12:55.183 --> 12:57.276
You said yourself,
it's not on us to judge.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.616
Yeah.
Except that that's complete crap.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.758
Everybody judges. I'm just supposed
to ignore what that guy did?

13:04.926 --> 13:06.826
- We've shot people. More than two.
- Yeah.

13:06.994 --> 13:10.361
When those ghosts come to kick my ass,
they've got a compelling case.

13:10.565 --> 13:13.466
So what? You're saying
you don't wanna work the job anymore?

13:13.634 --> 13:16.626
I'm just saying,
one simple freaking day on the job...

13:16.804 --> 13:18.499
...is that too much to ask?

13:20.708 --> 13:23.302
I'm gonna go out,
I'm gonna try and find that barn.

13:23.477 --> 13:25.342
- You coming?
- I'm gonna check the bar.

13:26.214 --> 13:28.205
To work or drink?

13:28.382 --> 13:30.213
I haven't decided.

13:42.630 --> 13:45.531
What's going on? Where did he go?

13:46.167 --> 13:49.500
He, uh... Everything is fine.
Look, um, let's go back to that farm.

13:49.670 --> 13:52.571
- No, I'm not going back.
- I need your help finding that barn.

13:52.740 --> 13:55.709
It's red, stands out.
I'm not going back. They're out there.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.138
Who?

13:57.311 --> 13:58.369
The people I killed.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.241
I just... No.

14:00.414 --> 14:03.611
- No.
- Look, you're safer with me than not.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.612
No.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.054
Okay. Fine.

14:13.527 --> 14:18.658
I need you to stay inside the circle
until I get back. Okay?

14:18.833 --> 14:20.528
- It will protect you.
- How?

14:20.701 --> 14:23.169
Just trust me, okay?
I'm trying to help.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.904
Stay put.

14:34.515 --> 14:35.573
Bobby, hey.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.378
Me. Listen, I'm sending you
some symbols to look up.

14:38.552 --> 14:40.213
Stay put.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.291
Excuse me.

14:51.966 --> 14:54.867
Ah, dive, sweet dive.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.363
Hey.

14:58.539 --> 15:00.769
Well,
now I know why everybody comes here.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.774
- Ha, ha. What can I get you?
- Scotch and soda.

15:05.579 --> 15:07.911
You know, hold the soda.
Make it a double.

15:09.383 --> 15:11.783
So you, uh, work the night shift?

15:12.987 --> 15:15.251
Why?
Plan on making this a regular thing?

15:15.423 --> 15:16.651
Ha-ha-ha.

15:16.824 --> 15:18.485
No. I just got a few questions.

15:18.693 --> 15:20.092
Believe it or not I'm a cop.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.489
I believe it.
You look like you've seen some crap.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.326
I'm sorry, I was off all week.
Frank will be back tomorrow.

15:30.104 --> 15:32.971
Right. Yeah.

15:34.408 --> 15:35.773
I'll do another.

15:35.943 --> 15:37.205
Love life orjob?

15:37.645 --> 15:40.409
Two quick doubles, it's something.

15:40.581 --> 15:42.208
I'm Mia, by the way.

15:42.516 --> 15:45.644
Well, Mia, that is a complex question.

15:45.920 --> 15:46.978
I'm Dean, by the way.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.447
Well, Dean, luckily...

15:48.622 --> 15:51.216
...I'm like a captive shrink
with unlimited alcohol.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.522
- So shoot.
- Ha, ha.

15:54.729 --> 15:57.220
- You like to hear people's problems.
- I get curious.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.165
On occasion.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.269
Work thing. Since you asked.

16:08.943 --> 16:10.376
You ever, uh?

16:11.746 --> 16:14.544
Ever do something behind
someone's back because you had to?

16:14.749 --> 16:16.512
Now you feel bad?

16:16.684 --> 16:19.812
Well, Dean, if you had to,
why feel guilty?

16:20.788 --> 16:23.018
It doesn't make any sense.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.748
Hmm.

16:28.262 --> 16:30.526
Well, we don't have enough room
for the worms...

16:30.698 --> 16:31.960
...if we pop that can.

16:35.302 --> 16:38.169
- May wanna slow your roll.
- More I drink, the better I tip.

16:38.339 --> 16:41.331
Yeah, well, I'm off in an hour.
So don't pass out on me.

16:42.076 --> 16:43.634
I think I'll switch to beer.

16:44.979 --> 16:47.038
Good choice.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.936
- Bobby, what have you got?
- Those chicken scratches.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.048
<i>Definitely Egyptian. Book of the Dead.</i>

17:56.217 --> 17:57.707
So good news, then.

17:57.885 --> 18:00.945
They identify the god Osiris.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.316
Real authoritarian type.

18:03.491 --> 18:06.585
He gets ahold of you,
he's judge, jury and executioner.

18:06.927 --> 18:10.658
<i>Lore says that he can see directly
into the human heart.</i>

18:11.298 --> 18:12.595
He weighs the guilt.

18:12.766 --> 18:15.428
If he finds more than a feather's worth,
boom, you're done.

18:15.603 --> 18:18.504
- So, what's he doing in Dearborn?
- Seems like he pops up...

18:18.672 --> 18:22.267
...and does his circuit judge act
and then disappears again.

18:22.443 --> 18:23.774
That's all I got so far.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.075
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- Yeah. We gotta find him...</i>

18:27.248 --> 18:29.580
...before he goes underground again.
No, idjot.

18:29.750 --> 18:32.116
It means you two gotta get the hell
out of Dodge.

18:32.286 --> 18:35.687
<i>This guy hones in on people
that feel guilty.</i>

18:35.890 --> 18:37.448
Who does that sound like to you?

18:41.028 --> 18:45.124
It's been a while, but you owe yourself.
Nothing but a ground ball.

18:45.299 --> 18:48.029
You just gotta put your mitt down.

18:48.435 --> 18:50.767
You are Dean Winchester.

18:51.405 --> 18:53.430
This is what you do.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.880
Dude, third message.
You better not be loaded.

19:09.056 --> 19:11.616
Call me. This is important.

19:13.627 --> 19:15.822
<i>- Dean. About time, man, I, uh...
- Hello?</i>

19:15.996 --> 19:17.554
- Who is this?
- Oh, I just...

19:17.731 --> 19:19.198
I picked this off the ground...

19:19.366 --> 19:22.460
...where I've been standing
for 10 minutes listening to it ring.

19:22.636 --> 19:24.831
- Is this Dean's phone?
- Yeah.

19:25.339 --> 19:27.671
Well, uh, he was supposed
to meet me here.

19:27.841 --> 19:29.866
Where are you? I can be right there.

19:45.659 --> 19:47.024
Sam?

20:08.115 --> 20:09.207
No, please.

20:10.050 --> 20:11.574
I'm sorry.

20:12.519 --> 20:14.111
- Please.
- You did it to us.

20:16.724 --> 20:18.783
Well, here it is.

20:18.993 --> 20:21.257
Uh, I hope he's okay.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.726
Now,
where exactly did you find this phone?

20:23.897 --> 20:25.262
Uh...

20:25.432 --> 20:26.990
There.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.425
Thanks.

21:13.113 --> 21:15.741
Really, Warren?
All you noticed were the symbols?

21:18.352 --> 21:20.820
Quit squirming, Mr. Winchester.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.080
They're Houdini-proof.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.320
Now, you wanna talk charges, or...?

21:26.493 --> 21:29.587
I'd rather talk
about your Bukowski schtick at the bar.

21:29.763 --> 21:31.355
Can't jump a guy when he's sober?

21:31.565 --> 21:33.465
You and that waitress
had quite a talk, huh.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.326
Get a couple of drinks in you
and the guilt comes pouring out.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.472
Eavesdropping. That's cute.

21:39.640 --> 21:40.937
Speaking of.

21:41.108 --> 21:43.770
You gonna skulk all night, Sam?

21:47.448 --> 21:48.506
Sam?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.276
Nice job finding us.

21:52.619 --> 21:54.610
I assume you figured out
who I am too?

21:55.089 --> 21:56.147
Yeah.

21:57.157 --> 21:58.283
You wanna fill me in?

22:00.627 --> 22:02.686
Osiris.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.023
He's an Egyptian god.

22:04.631 --> 22:06.394
Ta-da.

22:07.301 --> 22:08.962
Now, go about your business, Sammy.

22:09.136 --> 22:11.502
Look,
if anyone should be on trial, it's me.

22:11.672 --> 22:12.969
That's for me to decide.

22:13.140 --> 22:14.539
Now, go away.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.734
But he has the right to an attorney,
doesn't he?

22:17.911 --> 22:19.173
- Huh.
- Let me defend him.

22:19.346 --> 22:22.509
- That's unusual.
- You gonna respect his rights or not?

22:25.519 --> 22:27.180
Why not?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.850
Sam, you're not a lawyer.

22:32.025 --> 22:34.255
- I was pre-law.
- Yeah, pre.

22:34.428 --> 22:36.726
All right, then, let's get started.

22:38.265 --> 22:40.825
Now, the list of witnesses I can call...

22:41.001 --> 22:42.400
...endless.
Objection.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.629
- You gonna let me finish my sentence?
- No. This isn't fair.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.005
Huh. Fair? I'm sorry.

22:50.677 --> 22:52.577
Moving on.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.236
I can make it very simple.

22:56.216 --> 22:57.274
Three witnesses.

22:57.451 --> 22:58.884
- Objection.
- Grounds?

22:59.052 --> 23:01.145
Witnesses being called
without prior notice.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.218
<i>- Good one.
- Saw that on The Good Wife.</i>

23:03.390 --> 23:06.120
Yes. Very fine objection.

23:06.293 --> 23:08.124
- Denied.
- What? Why?

23:08.295 --> 23:10.229
Because I'm the judge, son.

23:11.265 --> 23:14.200
Now stop objecting...

23:14.368 --> 23:16.302
...or I'll find you in contempt.

23:16.670 --> 23:18.797
That is kill you.

23:19.273 --> 23:23.175
So I advise you
to let me move it along.

23:25.746 --> 23:31.776
Prosecution calls Joanna Beth Harvelle
to the stand.

23:35.789 --> 23:36.881
Jo?

23:37.057 --> 23:39.423
Dean. Sam.

23:39.593 --> 23:40.685
Long time.

23:45.199 --> 23:47.599
State your name for the court.

23:48.135 --> 23:52.799
- Jo Harvelle.
- And what is your relationship...

23:52.973 --> 23:54.099
...to Dean Winchester?

23:55.576 --> 23:56.941
We worked together.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.514
Isn't it true that you admired him?

24:08.589 --> 24:11.581
Well, as a hunter, yeah.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.684
As a guy, he was kind of ajerk.

24:14.862 --> 24:19.322
So you saw him as a mentor of sorts?

24:19.499 --> 24:22.491
- I wouldn't put it like that.
- How would you put it?

24:22.669 --> 24:24.432
I don't know.

24:25.239 --> 24:26.604
I trusted him.

24:27.474 --> 24:29.339
If you're trying to say he was a bad...

24:29.509 --> 24:30.635
Was it hard?

24:30.811 --> 24:32.335
What?

24:32.980 --> 24:34.811
Working with him.

24:34.982 --> 24:36.313
Considering your feelings.

24:36.483 --> 24:37.711
No. What feelings?

24:37.885 --> 24:41.616
You would've done quite a bit for him,
followed him into any battle.

24:41.788 --> 24:43.722
I know what you're getting at.
It's bull.

24:43.891 --> 24:47.452
So Dean had nothing to do
with your first case.

24:47.628 --> 24:49.562
The one that started it all.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.333
It wasn't like that.

25:01.508 --> 25:04.068
No feelings. None at all.

25:05.178 --> 25:09.342
You would've chosen
the exact same road...

25:11.084 --> 25:13.848
...ended up in that hardware store...

25:14.888 --> 25:15.980
...holding a fuse.

25:16.156 --> 25:19.421
You're a piece of work, you know that?
Putting words in her mouth...

25:21.228 --> 25:23.162
Keep him under control, counsel.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.062
Or I'll remove his tongue.

25:28.835 --> 25:29.893
Your witness.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.336
Jo.

25:41.548 --> 25:43.038
So, um...

25:44.618 --> 25:46.950
...your dad was in the life?

25:47.521 --> 25:48.579
Yes, he was.

25:49.556 --> 25:51.046
And your relationship with him?

25:51.558 --> 25:54.049
- Good. I mean...
- You idolized him.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.924
- Basically.
- So why did you start?

25:58.098 --> 26:01.124
To impress some loudmouth ass
you just met?

26:01.468 --> 26:03.766
Or because you wanted to be
like your dad?

26:03.937 --> 26:06.201
Daddy issues. Definitely.

26:08.408 --> 26:10.035
Listen, Dean, I don't...

26:11.912 --> 26:12.970
All right.

26:13.914 --> 26:18.248
You two can have a moment
to strategize.

26:21.154 --> 26:22.951
And then I'll call my next witness.

26:29.096 --> 26:30.961
All right. Who's the next witness?

26:32.099 --> 26:34.397
- He looked at you like you'd know.
- Got no clue.

26:35.435 --> 26:37.733
<i>This whole thing
is like Pee-wee's Playhouse.</i>

26:37.904 --> 26:39.428
Next witness.

26:39.606 --> 26:41.164
Prosecution calls...

26:43.010 --> 26:44.671
...Sam Winchester to the stand.

26:48.415 --> 26:49.473
Sam.

26:50.250 --> 26:53.583
Not exactly the life you expected,
is it?

26:54.588 --> 26:55.987
Detail is a little different.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.624
For a while there,
you were gonna be a real lawyer.

26:58.792 --> 27:01.989
- Marry Jess.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.

27:02.295 --> 27:05.696
But were you or were you not
happily out of the family racket...

27:05.899 --> 27:09.096
...until Dean showed back up
in that gas-guzzler?

27:09.269 --> 27:11.328
Uh-uh. The truth now.

27:20.914 --> 27:22.506
It's complicated.

27:23.950 --> 27:26.851
That one act
had quite a domino effect.

27:28.822 --> 27:30.449
Come back, your girl's dead.

27:30.624 --> 27:34.060
- That wasn't his fault.
- Neither is everything that came after.

27:34.227 --> 27:37.128
All the death and the blood,
and hanging on by a thread.

27:37.297 --> 27:40.130
None of that is on Dean, directly.

28:03.356 --> 28:04.584
But don't you think...

28:04.758 --> 28:07.818
...your brother dragged you back
into that catastrophic mess...

28:07.994 --> 28:10.656
...because he'd rather damn you
with him than be alone?

28:19.773 --> 28:22.173
No. One way or another,
I'd gotten pulled back in.

28:22.342 --> 28:23.832
- You know that for certain?
- Pretty sure.

28:24.010 --> 28:25.602
- Pretty sure.
- I'm positive.

28:26.713 --> 28:27.873
I believe you.

28:28.048 --> 28:30.039
Hey, if it was about convincing me...

28:30.217 --> 28:31.411
...I would say, heh...
What?

28:33.787 --> 28:36.688
I don't decide anything, Sam.

28:37.190 --> 28:38.919
I don't decide Dean's guilt.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.720
I just weigh the guilt
that's already there.

28:42.762 --> 28:46.994
This is solely about how Dean feels...

28:47.367 --> 28:49.232
...way down deep.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.462
Them's the breaks.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.107
Wait.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.768
So if Dean believes he's innocent,
then he is?

29:00.113 --> 29:01.375
If.

29:01.548 --> 29:03.914
A big if.

29:04.084 --> 29:05.745
Why do I bring up the past?

29:06.052 --> 29:10.284
To see
if he feels like dog food about it.

29:11.224 --> 29:12.919
People wanna be judged.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.750
They really do.

29:15.162 --> 29:17.562
When your heart's heavy,
let me tell you...

29:18.064 --> 29:19.554
...real punishment's a mercy.

29:21.034 --> 29:24.162
- I wanna call Dean to the stand.
- Oh, you do now?

29:24.337 --> 29:26.100
There is an order to this stuff.

29:27.407 --> 29:29.466
Okay, I'll allow it.

29:40.854 --> 29:43.550
So, Dean...

29:44.324 --> 29:47.088
...when you came and got me,
did you know Jess would die?

29:47.260 --> 29:48.784
- Or any of it?
- Of course not.

29:48.962 --> 29:51.328
Right. How could you?
I mean, are you psychic?

29:54.834 --> 29:56.597
That's a question.

29:56.803 --> 29:57.963
No.

29:58.138 --> 29:59.696
- Definitely not psychic.
- Great.

29:59.873 --> 30:03.138
So why would you feel guilty
about not predicting the future?

30:03.310 --> 30:04.971
Guess that doesn't make any sense.

30:05.145 --> 30:07.170
Actually, yeah. No, I don't.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.577
What about Jo?
Did you actually kill her?

30:12.219 --> 30:14.551
- Uh, no.
- Isn't it true...

30:14.721 --> 30:19.021
...that you don't feel guilty about her?
That you're just sad she's dead?

30:19.192 --> 30:21.888
That it just blows?

30:23.797 --> 30:26.891
Actually, maybe, yeah.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.532
Mm-mm-mm.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.467
I like your style, Sam.

30:32.639 --> 30:34.004
- Very engaging.
- Dean...

30:36.109 --> 30:39.806
...does any of this feel
like it's really on you?

30:41.748 --> 30:43.807
Not really.

30:43.984 --> 30:46.544
Then is your heart heavy with guilt...

30:46.720 --> 30:50.019
...or just plain heavy,
and none of this guy's business?

30:50.190 --> 30:53.318
Uh, what you said. The second thing.

30:54.761 --> 30:55.887
Then I rest my case.

30:56.062 --> 30:58.053
Very good. Both of you.

30:58.632 --> 30:59.826
All right.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.865
Because I really enjoyed that...

31:02.035 --> 31:04.526
...I'm gonna be generous and ask.

31:04.704 --> 31:07.696
Dean,
do you want me to call my last witness?

31:11.044 --> 31:14.377
I know you didn't wanna let her go,
but it was the right thing to do.

31:14.547 --> 31:16.174
No problem.

31:18.018 --> 31:20.282
Or have we had enough?

31:24.024 --> 31:26.390
- What is he talking about?
- Enough Ally McBealing.

31:26.559 --> 31:28.686
- Drop the hammer.
- He's giving us more time.

31:28.862 --> 31:31.695
- It's not gonna make a difference.
- Need another moment?

31:31.865 --> 31:33.230
You're done?

31:42.676 --> 31:45.543
The court's reached a verdict.

31:47.947 --> 31:51.405
I find you, Dean Winchester...

31:51.584 --> 31:52.881
...guilty in your heart...

31:54.587 --> 31:56.817
...and sentence you to die.

31:57.757 --> 32:01.659
I suggest you get your affairs in order
quickly.

32:31.758 --> 32:33.919
Damn it, I told him.

32:34.461 --> 32:36.861
Osiris would've got to him
one way or another.

32:37.030 --> 32:38.827
Guy's batting a thousand.

32:38.998 --> 32:42.092
There's still time.
We can figure something out.

32:58.151 --> 33:01.018
- Bobby? What have you got?
- A way to give Osiris a dirt nap.

33:01.388 --> 33:03.515
Good. We need it.

33:03.690 --> 33:07.353
As near as I can figure, it ought to
put him down for a couple of centuries.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.018
<i>It's worked a few times
since the pharaohs were big.</i>

33:10.196 --> 33:12.562
<i>- So it's temporary?
- Long temporary.</i>

33:12.766 --> 33:15.735
I say we slap that Band-Aid on,
leave finding a cure...

33:15.902 --> 33:17.665
...to some hunter in a space suit.

33:17.837 --> 33:20.829
Now, you're gonna need to stab him
with a ram's horn.

33:21.007 --> 33:23.840
Ram's horn? Where am I gonna find
a ram's horn in Dearborn?

33:24.010 --> 33:25.170
<i>No clue.</i>

33:25.345 --> 33:28.746
Make sure it's a sharp piece.
He ain't gonna let you stab him twice.

33:28.915 --> 33:30.212
Yeah, thanks.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.146
Ram's horn.

33:33.853 --> 33:36.185
Uh, okay.

33:37.924 --> 33:41.860
Huh. Apparently, uh, Jewish people
blow through them once a year.

33:43.196 --> 33:45.164
Where are you gonna find one
this time of night?

33:45.331 --> 33:48.357
- Uh, synagogue?
- Steal from a temple?

33:49.302 --> 33:50.360
That's a new low.

33:50.537 --> 33:52.698
You're on death row, Dean.
Quit joking around.

33:52.872 --> 33:54.430
Here. Keys. I'll be back.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.939
The dick is gonna sic Jo after me,
Sam.

33:57.710 --> 34:00.838
You're a hunter, Dean.
You know how to deal with ghosts.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.509
You suggesting I kill her again?

34:07.687 --> 34:10.178
You didn't kill her, Dean.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.614
I'll hurry.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.733
You can come out now.

34:58.771 --> 35:01.865
I'm guessing you're not here
for bar mitzvah lessons.

35:03.409 --> 35:04.569
Uh...

35:04.744 --> 35:08.145
I've seen handbags with jewelry...

35:09.883 --> 35:13.683
And every single time,
I think I should...

35:13.887 --> 35:16.412
You know I'd never do this.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.617
I know.

35:20.960 --> 35:24.987
I guess it's his thing.
Some kind of twisted eye for an eye.

35:27.433 --> 35:29.492
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

35:31.971 --> 35:33.836
- You deserve better.
- No, you did.

35:35.341 --> 35:37.309
You deserved better, Jo.

35:49.956 --> 35:52.447
Dean, my life was good.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.417
Really.

35:55.328 --> 35:57.319
He was right, you know.

35:57.497 --> 36:00.364
- That dick judge. About me.
- No, he wasn't.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.127
- You were a kid.
- Not true.

36:03.736 --> 36:05.795
You and Sam.

36:06.439 --> 36:07.667
No, I just...

36:08.174 --> 36:13.168
You know, hunters are never kids.
I never was.

36:13.346 --> 36:16.838
- I didn't even stop to think about it.
- Not your fault. It wasn't on you.

36:17.016 --> 36:19.246
No. But I didn't wanna do it alone.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.981
Who does?

36:22.488 --> 36:25.355
Right thing would've been to send you
back home to your mom.

36:25.525 --> 36:27.015
I'd like to have seen you try.

36:30.530 --> 36:31.963
He was right about one thing.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.224
Your crush on me?

36:34.667 --> 36:35.895
Heh, shut up.

36:40.173 --> 36:42.835
You carry all kinds of crap
you don't have to, Dean.

36:47.180 --> 36:48.841
It gets clearer when you're dead.

36:51.751 --> 36:57.747
Well, in that case, you should be able
to see that I am 90 percent crap.

37:01.527 --> 37:03.757
I get rid of that, what then?

37:03.930 --> 37:05.693
You really wanna die not knowing?

37:10.637 --> 37:12.104
Dean.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.530
Yeah.

37:13.706 --> 37:15.105
It's time.

37:49.575 --> 37:53.739
Come on, Dean.
I used to hunt ghosts, I know the tricks.

38:10.963 --> 38:12.260
He's making me do this.

38:13.199 --> 38:14.461
It's okay.

39:07.854 --> 39:09.344
Jo?

39:16.529 --> 39:19.225
So, uh, it seemed like...

39:19.398 --> 39:23.164
- You know, like, she was in pain?
- No.

39:24.036 --> 39:26.766
No. Just kind of faded. Regular Jo.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.637
Actually, maybe a little happier.

39:33.546 --> 39:34.570
I got a question.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.777
Where the hell did that come from?

39:37.950 --> 39:39.941
- Volunteering to defend me?
- Heh.

39:40.453 --> 39:41.920
He was gonna kick me out.

39:42.655 --> 39:46.182
I don't know. In another life, you
might've made a pretty decent scuzzbag.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.788
I'm 0 for 1, Dean.

39:48.961 --> 39:50.223
Ah, it's not your fault.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.257
You were convincing.

39:54.467 --> 39:56.025
- Who was he talking about?
- Who?

39:56.202 --> 39:58.397
That whole final witness thing?

39:59.939 --> 40:01.304
No idea.

40:01.474 --> 40:05.069
Honestly, that could be
just about anybody dead we know.

40:08.614 --> 40:13.074
By the way, I mean, I get why,
you know, Judge Judy put me on trial.

40:13.252 --> 40:15.447
I got guilt coming out of my pores.
But, uh...

40:16.889 --> 40:18.447
...why did he skip you?

40:20.760 --> 40:24.821
I think I just don't feel guilty anymore.

40:25.431 --> 40:27.399
- Come on.
- I don't know what to tell you.

40:27.567 --> 40:30.468
I've spent a lot of time feeling crappy.
Like my whole life.

40:30.636 --> 40:33.264
What?
You got a secret stash of happy pills?

40:35.474 --> 40:38.409
Hell. Look, I'm not saying it's logical.
I just...

40:39.345 --> 40:43.008
You know, I feel like I did a lot of stuff
I should have felt bad for...

40:43.216 --> 40:46.413
...and then I paid a lot of dues
and came out the other side.

40:46.586 --> 40:49.987
And that worked? I mean,
you really feel like your slate's wiped?

40:50.156 --> 40:51.748
No.

40:51.924 --> 40:54.154
Nothing ever gets wiped,
you know, I, uh...

40:54.327 --> 40:56.989
Sometimes I see Lucifer
when I brush my teeth but...

40:57.163 --> 41:01.600
I don't know, I guess I just finally feel
like my past is my past...

41:01.767 --> 41:03.667
...and I can move on with my life.

41:03.836 --> 41:05.360
You know, hopefully.

41:05.538 --> 41:06.664
Easier said than done.

41:06.839 --> 41:07.999
Not arguing that.

41:11.878 --> 41:16.315
Well, I don't know whether to be,
uh, jealous or weirded out.

41:16.482 --> 41:18.211
You'll get used to it.

41:18.384 --> 41:20.682
I mean, I don't wanna sound lame...

41:21.988 --> 41:23.387
...but I kind of feel good.

41:27.193 --> 41:30.253
Well, you are going to be a pleasure
to ride with.
