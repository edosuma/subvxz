Are you my brother?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.376

Sorry about your father.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.676
Our father.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.017
You know he loved you.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.981
I'm sorry to be meeting like this.

01:48.859 --> 01:49.985
Me too.

01:53.864 --> 01:54.907
Is my mother here?

01:56.408 --> 01:57.659
I haven't seen her.

02:00.370 --> 02:04.625
We come to this day mindfulthat we've lost a beloved brother,

02:05.334 --> 02:08.628
a cherished friend, and a devoted father.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.675
Poppy.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.637
-Where's my mother?-I don't know.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.930
We should get going.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.767
What the hell is going on?My mother's supposed to be here.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.603
-I haven't talked to you in over a week.-You lied to me.

02:24.686 --> 02:25.687
What?

02:26.230 --> 02:28.815
You looked me right in the eyeand told me you weren't there that night.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.859
-What are you talking about?-A witness came forward.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.987
A credible one that puts you at theBuhrman house at the time of the murder.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.239
You were there, Warren.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.159
Not even gonna deny it.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.412
I didn't kill Chuck.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.206
I trusted you.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.541
You trusted me?

02:46.625 --> 02:48.794
I trusted you.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.840
After everything you did to try to bury meall those years ago.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.758
But I was right the first time.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.471
My mother was right about you.

03:00.389 --> 03:04.059
You were just using usto try to make yourself feel better.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.187
You're guilty, and your mother deservesto know the truth about you.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.189
You stay away from my mother.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.569
You stay away from heror I will fucking kill you.

03:13.652 --> 03:14.778
Come on, Cave. Let's go.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.989
Let me ask you a question.

03:17.781 --> 03:22.244
Whose fault do you think it isthat my dad is dead?

03:23.912 --> 03:26.123
Your hands aren't clean in this.

03:26.748 --> 03:30.711
My dad put a gun to his head...

03:30.794 --> 03:31.795
Come on.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.423
...but you are the onewho drove him to do it.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.426
We're all here because of you, Poppy.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.388
-Please tell me that you got that.-Yup.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.931
Can we get a comment, Ms. Parnell?

03:43.015 --> 03:46.101

03:46.185 --> 03:47.186
No comment.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.648

06:45.781 --> 06:47.574
Broke every rule of reporting.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.535

06:49.618 --> 06:51.787
I'm sorry, Ingram. Sorry about everything.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.247
It's okay.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.749
I'm done with the Warren Cave story.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.376
Finished with all of it.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.964
I'll record a finale,tell the world the truth,

07:02.047 --> 07:07.219
and then we can... put this behind us.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.721
-Okay.-Okay.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.059
Hi.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.561
You ordered room service?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.565
I'll set it right here, if that's okay.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.276
All right.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.612
Okay. Just gotta...

07:26.238 --> 07:27.531
Dining for two?

07:31.243 --> 07:32.286
Answer him.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.038
In your real accent.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.756
Oh, my God, where have you been?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.217
Someone taggedthe <i>Reconsidered</i> page on IG.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.511
They were sellingall these Buhrman collectibles.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.763
-Noa...-Buhrman home videos. Look at this.

07:51.847 --> 07:55.851
The family barbecue,Christmas '94, Mother's Day '96.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.812
We could rip the audioand put them on the podcast.

07:58.896 --> 07:59.938
-No.-"No"?

08:00.022 --> 08:02.274
No, I wanna lay in Warren's threat to me,

08:02.357 --> 08:05.027
show the world who he really is,and we're done.

08:05.944 --> 08:06.987
We're done.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.823
-Do you have the cut?-Yeah.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.825
What? I thought you'd be happy.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.328
Why would I be happy?We're stopping something that's working.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.413
I am done with these people, Noa.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.707
Just let me show youthe other thing I picked up.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.338
Lanie's diaryfrom when she was a teenager.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.091
Look at this. It's all symbolsin some kind of code language.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.054
There are entries every day of the weekfrom Chuck's murder.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.429
The best part,

08:34.306 --> 08:36.642
there's two people's handwriting in here.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.019
It's gotta be Lanie and Josie.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.813
We gotta get someone to crack it.There could be info in here.

08:41.897 --> 08:42.898
This is private.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.527
So was Susan's phone, but we'reon this ride now and so are our listeners.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.321
-Okay, this is our last episode.-It's bullshit to stop now.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.406
We can switch focus to the Buhrman women.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.660
-There is plenty of story.-I already told Markus that we were done.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.746
This is a gold mine. It could revealwhy she lied or who coached her.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.666
Somebody died in my house, Noa.

09:01.583 --> 09:06.213
Because of all of this.Because of this crazy... story.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.549
I mean, if that's not enough, Warren lied.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.592
And I can't put myself or Ingram--

09:10.676 --> 09:15.347
Oh, my God, I can't put Ingram...through any more of this, okay?

09:15.430 --> 09:18.141
For someone I don't trust.I just, I can't.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.603
Hey, hey, it's okay.I wasn't being sensitive.

09:21.687 --> 09:25.983
I'm just so used to you being unbreakable.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.696
But I get it. I hear you.You wanna stop, we stop.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.864
I'm sorry.

09:33.490 --> 09:38.203
I wanna record the finaleand then figure out what's next.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.705
You got it.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.338
People have been telling mefrom the beginning

09:48.422 --> 09:51.508
that Warren Cave was probably guilty.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.513
<i>And that I would drive myself crazytrying to find out the truth.</i>

09:58.724 --> 10:01.643
<i>And in many ways, I did.</i>

10:02.603 --> 10:05.063
Just when I thought I had the answers,

10:05.147 --> 10:09.818
something would come along and completelypull the rug out from under me.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.238
<i>Nobody wanted to give up the truth</i>

10:13.322 --> 10:18.452
<i>because giving it upmight've meant giving up hope.</i>

10:19.912 --> 10:22.623
<i>Former Stanford professor and cult authorkilled in his own home.</i>

10:22.706 --> 10:25.375
<i>His neighbor and the sonof the lead detective on the case</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:26.877
<i>has been arrested for his murder.</i>

10:26.960 --> 10:29.671
<i>I believed in Warren's innocence.</i>

10:29.755 --> 10:33.050
I launched this seriessure that I could prove it,

10:33.133 --> 10:35.969
and then I heard this.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.599
<i>I was driving my street sweeperat 4:00 in the morning</i>

10:40.682 --> 10:44.102
<i>when I saw the killer running awayfrom the victim's house</i>

10:44.186 --> 10:45.896
<i>with a knife in his hand.</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:48.982
<i>I never told the policethey had the right guy.</i>

10:49.066 --> 10:50.984
<i>What was he running from?</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:56.365
<i>What happened at the Halloween party?</i>

10:57.699 --> 11:00.077
<i>What made Warren kill Chuck?</i>

11:05.666 --> 11:06.834
<i>I don't know.</i>

11:07.543 --> 11:10.045
<i>I have no choice but to accept it.</i>

11:10.838 --> 11:14.341
Warren Cave is guilty,and that's the truth.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.261
And that's all I ever wanted.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.315
Thank you.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.446
Have you seen this?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.746
Where did you find this?

11:44.830 --> 11:47.124
On the Reconsidered website.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.917
Someone just forwarded it to me.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.302
Ingram?

11:58.969 --> 12:00.095
In here.

12:10.606 --> 12:13.775
Hey. Thought we'd chasesome of those demons out.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.069
By bringing in more demons?What's all this?

12:16.653 --> 12:19.990
You need them. They need you.Everybody wins. All right?

12:21.366 --> 12:22.409
Come on.

12:25.871 --> 12:26.955
Hey, y'all.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.007
I'm sorry about what happened in here.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.093
Thanks, baby.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.525
This table looks nice.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.276
-That was me.-Okay.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.820
Lillian cooked. She brought all the food.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.657
Thanks, Lil.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.284
And I didn't use any of your good china.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.914
All of her china is good china.She lucky we didn't bring Styrofoam.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.125
Quit playin'.You know you're too bougie for Styrofoam.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.128
I am. I really, really am.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.797
She is bougie.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.259
Hey, Daddy.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.010
Popsicle.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.724
Come sit with me a minute.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.032
Desiree told mewhat happened here with that cop.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.036
I hate you didn't call me yourself.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.374
You all right?

13:53.792 --> 13:54.835
No.

13:56.044 --> 13:59.381
But you told me once, "Nobody caresabout a little black girl's tears."

13:59.464 --> 14:02.718
So, I'm just trying to stay strong.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.261
I said that to you?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.681
When you dropped me off with Miss Shirley.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.060
I turned those words into my spine.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.979
And you know what?

14:14.062 --> 14:16.732
It's made of steel. Can't break me.

14:18.192 --> 14:21.778
I should not have said that to you.I should have never said that shit to you.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.073
-It's okay.-No.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.450
No, it's not.

14:35.918 --> 14:39.338
You... are my life, Poppy.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.049
You know that, right?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.801
All you girls.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.057
I ran the streets as hard as I didto take care of my family.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.145
You ran the streets because you liked it.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.694
Gonna put a couple of piecesof corn bread in there.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.446
This was magic here.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.449
Thank you, baby.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.826
What are you doing?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.495
We have to say grace.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.539
-This is incredible.-Okay.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.457
A happy day, and I'm so happy.

15:15.541 --> 15:18.252
So, Lillian, would you do the honors?

15:18.335 --> 15:19.336
Sure.

15:21.088 --> 15:24.341
Heavenly Father, we thank youfor this opportunity to fellowship

15:24.424 --> 15:25.676
and break bread as a family.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.678
We ask that you bless this meal,

15:27.761 --> 15:31.056
the hands that prepared itand the mouths that are about to receive.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.141
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.601
-Amen!-All right.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.603
-Can I pass the meat?-Now you can.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.448
Caleb wants to meet the family.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.742
He's here. He's insisting.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.578
Whoa. Slow down.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.162
I cannot believe that you called him.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.581
What were you thinking?

15:55.664 --> 15:57.249
Don't put this all on me.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.878
You're the one who's been lying to him,pretending that I don't even exist.

16:00.961 --> 16:04.715
For good reason!You had no right to call him!

16:04.798 --> 16:07.384
I had no right? What about you?

16:07.467 --> 16:10.637
You're the one who soldall of our childhood shit to some ghoul

16:10.721 --> 16:13.056
who's selling it on the Internetto the highest bidder.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.892
What? What are you talking about?

16:14.975 --> 16:18.770
All of our shit from the storage unitis on the Internet.

16:18.854 --> 16:19.855
No.

16:20.272 --> 16:23.025
No, I paid the storage guyto get rid of it.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.360
My diary is in there, Josie.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.446
Yeah. This is all your fault.

16:27.529 --> 16:30.616
You're just as cluelessand self-righteous as you ever were.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.911
No. I--Aunt Susan is the one that made me--

16:33.994 --> 16:36.371
And then you told meI had to deal with it. You did!

16:36.830 --> 16:39.041
I didn't want any part of any of this!None of it!

16:39.124 --> 16:41.919
Okay. Okay! God, calm down.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.465
Look, I'm sorry that I called him.

16:46.548 --> 16:49.510
I honestly thought that I was...I could help.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.347
Let me fix this, all right?

16:53.430 --> 16:55.641
-Now, why don't we just invite Caleb over?-What?

16:55.724 --> 16:58.268
And we can answer any questionsthat he might have.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.231
You know?Then we'll just put everything behind us.

17:04.816 --> 17:05.983
Fine.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.862
Okay. It's okay.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.117
I'm only doing this'cause I have no other choice.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.546
Hey. Last night was nice.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.216
Did you post your last episode?

17:29.299 --> 17:31.885
Uh-uh. I'm still tweaking it.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.766
How come you never told meyou were in foster care?

17:39.518 --> 17:42.020
What? Who told you that?

17:42.437 --> 17:43.772
Your father.

17:43.856 --> 17:46.692
I didn't ask before

17:46.775 --> 17:50.153
'cause of everythingthat happened with Owen.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.238
But...

17:52.656 --> 17:53.699
What did he tell you?

17:54.533 --> 17:55.659
Just that...

17:57.494 --> 17:59.955
you been trying to get back at himfor 30 years

18:01.039 --> 18:02.624
for him putting you in there.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.918
He said that? When?

18:09.631 --> 18:10.841
Were you in foster care?

18:11.383 --> 18:14.261
Babe. It wasn't that formal.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.098
Miss Shirley was a family friend.She took kids in.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.975
That's how they used to do it.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.480
We grew up differently.

18:26.982 --> 18:30.027
My family grew up hard for generations.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.362
-I know that.-No, you don't.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.908
I mean, not really.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.632
You should air that last episode.

19:03.602 --> 19:05.103
So you want to know what I think?

19:05.187 --> 19:08.357
I think if you really wanted to stop,you would have dropped the finale by now.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.566
Is that right?

19:09.650 --> 19:13.987
Look, you can't quit now, Pop. All right?Way too many unanswered questions.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.990
-Noa got to you, didn't she?-As she should have.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.618
What, you thought you wasjust gonna get rid of me that easy?

19:20.619 --> 19:22.913
Look, that street sweeper,

19:22.996 --> 19:26.375
he swore up and down thathe saw Warren running towards the street.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.961
-Markus---Hold on. Hold on.

19:29.044 --> 19:32.881
Look, that's a direct contradictionto what Lanie said.

19:32.965 --> 19:35.384
Warren couldn't have jumpedthe back fence.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.303
So that goes back to ouroriginal question: Why did Lanie lie?

19:38.387 --> 19:40.514
Enough. Okay?

19:40.931 --> 19:43.308
I watched Owen put a gun to his head.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.855
In my house.

19:49.523 --> 19:53.277
Why can't anybody understand that?What else has to happen?

19:54.486 --> 19:55.487
You done?

19:56.822 --> 19:58.073
Forget you, Markus.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.993
No, you know, the reason whywe're here right now is

20:01.076 --> 20:04.288
because you turned your backon the truth 19 years ago.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.457
Are you ready to go through that again?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.346
Noa gave me this. Okay?

20:22.222 --> 20:25.100
Now, what we need to do,is we need to figure out

20:25.184 --> 20:27.728
exactly what Josie and Laniewere saying to each other.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.146
I don't give a shit what it says.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.856
Yeah, well, I don't believe that.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.568
I'm sorry you went through that with Owen.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.028
Okay?

20:36.528 --> 20:38.113
But look, if you're hurtin' now,

20:38.197 --> 20:41.283
think about how you're gonna feelif you don't get all the answers.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.160
He's guilty.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.662
Prove it.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.544
You know, at the end of the day,I don't give a shit about Warren Cave.

20:53.587 --> 20:54.880
But I do care about you.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.092
Gotta prove it for yourself, Pop.

21:30.082 --> 21:31.208
Can we talk?

21:32.668 --> 21:35.295
If you're looking for sympathy'cause of your dead daddy,

21:36.213 --> 21:37.506
you ain't gonna find it here.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.178
Look, I just wanna clear the air.

21:45.514 --> 21:47.307
I messed up with that reporter.

21:47.391 --> 21:48.642
More than you think.

21:49.518 --> 21:51.645
It even caused issues on the outside.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.566
Putting the spotlight on Jerbic,just so she could talk to you.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.904
I let her put hope in my head.

22:02.281 --> 22:06.034
I was wrong. And then she betrayed me.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.870
What did you expect?

22:09.162 --> 22:11.206
She comes from a race of animals.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.459
And now you're here...

22:15.961 --> 22:18.755
because you want to come backto your real family.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.510
I never left.

22:24.595 --> 22:25.637
Look,

22:26.471 --> 22:28.473
I'm always loyal to you.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.268
All right, whatever you need.

22:47.284 --> 22:51.455
This... is the only family you got.

22:52.956 --> 22:56.001
You know,it's the only family any of us got.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.296
Families...

23:05.135 --> 23:06.512
Families...

23:09.515 --> 23:11.767
they take care of each other.

23:16.855 --> 23:17.898
Go.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.067
Go on.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.117
I'm gonna needa gesture from you, brother.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.374
To show your faith.

23:51.557 --> 23:52.808
Oh, my God.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.270
Oh, my God.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.239
Give us a callif you find anything missing.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.783
And we'll let you knowif we get a hit on those prints.

24:09.867 --> 24:12.119
-Hey, baby.-Daddy.

24:12.202 --> 24:13.912
-You okay?-Yeah.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.497
Where's Ingram?

24:15.956 --> 24:17.624
He's on his way back from Carmel.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.543
I'm glad you called me.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.170
You're sure you're all right?

24:21.795 --> 24:25.174
I'm fine. It's just... the house.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.759
And what did the police say?

24:28.427 --> 24:30.971
That there were burglariesin the area recently.

24:31.054 --> 24:34.183
They think it might be teenagers.Basically, nothin'.

24:34.266 --> 24:35.934
I don't believe in accidents.

24:37.728 --> 24:38.770
Who would do this?

24:39.730 --> 24:40.731
I don't know.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.359
Is it because of your show, that prisoner?

24:44.776 --> 24:45.777
I ended it.

24:45.861 --> 24:48.113
-When?-Couple of days ago.

24:48.864 --> 24:51.074
And what did he say when you told him?

24:51.950 --> 24:53.076
Poppy.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.662
He said he'd kill me.But it was an empty threat.

24:55.746 --> 24:57.581
Come on. You know better than that.

24:58.123 --> 25:00.959
All he's gotta do is reach outto someone on the outside.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.296
And who did you use to get to him before?

25:05.797 --> 25:08.383
-Jerbic.-Well, I told you he wasn't shit.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.637
These cats are gonna stay behinduntil Ingram gets home,

25:11.720 --> 25:12.888
longer if you need.

25:12.971 --> 25:15.599
-Wait. Where you goin'?-Leave the soldiers behind.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.643
-On point, brother. Take care.-Sir.

25:28.779 --> 25:30.989
Don't worry. I don't bite.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.326
Welcome to our abode.

25:34.952 --> 25:38.330
It's nothing fancy,but it's our little slice of paradise.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.707
-This is my husband.-Alex.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.210
-Nice to meet you.-You too.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.005
Hi, Caleb.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.217
I'm Erin, Josie's mom.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.261
Nice to meet you.

25:54.471 --> 25:58.267
So, can I get y'all something to drink?Water, wine?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.560
Wine, please.

26:01.395 --> 26:02.521
Same.

26:03.021 --> 26:06.066
Caleb? Beer?

26:07.651 --> 26:09.528
Beer sounds good.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.490
-Erin?-No. Nothing for me.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.117
Although you should all have a drink.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.662
You look like you need one,and it's a party, right?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.122
Let's lighten it up.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.457
See? He gets it.

26:23.959 --> 26:27.379
Okay. Well, come on.I'll get you all those drinks.

26:30.591 --> 26:33.177
<i>Attention, all of C block.Attention, C block.</i>

26:33.260 --> 26:37.723
<i>Officer Harris. Officer R. Harris,report to center now, please.</i>

26:46.481 --> 26:48.942
Somebody trashed my house last night.

26:49.026 --> 26:50.110
Good.

26:51.570 --> 26:52.905
Did you order it?

26:53.947 --> 26:56.867
No. But I wish that I had.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.243
Go to hell.

26:58.869 --> 27:01.455
Now, that doesn't soundlike an apology to me.

27:01.955 --> 27:03.749
An apology to you? For what?

27:03.832 --> 27:06.627
You owe me for lyingabout being at the Buhrman house.

27:06.710 --> 27:09.713
-You were there that night.-I told you, I didn't kill Chuck.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.548
And I'm supposed to believe you?

27:12.841 --> 27:13.842
You know what?

27:14.384 --> 27:18.472
If you think that I am guilty,why did you come back?

27:19.848 --> 27:21.350
A witness said they saw you running

27:21.433 --> 27:24.311
from the front of the Buhrman housewith a knife.

27:24.394 --> 27:25.479
So?

27:26.313 --> 27:29.608
Lanie testified she saw youjumping the back fence.

27:30.234 --> 27:31.777
Somebody lied.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.905
And as long as there's a lie,or the hint of one,

27:35.364 --> 27:36.782
I have to find out the truth.

27:39.201 --> 27:44.081
And now it is up to meto decide if I trust you or not.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.093
Any idea what that says?

27:57.469 --> 27:58.720
It's in code.

27:59.847 --> 28:02.474
But I think it says,"Poppy is full of shit."

28:04.059 --> 28:05.894
-Don't want to help?-Why should I?

28:26.164 --> 28:28.709
Who is the first person you metwhen you got to Quentin?

28:30.460 --> 28:31.461
What?

28:34.756 --> 28:37.342
What was your first day in lockup like?

28:37.426 --> 28:38.886
As a 17-year-old boy,

28:38.969 --> 28:43.849
in here with grown menwho were killers, rapists, sadists.

28:45.434 --> 28:47.102
Who befriended you first?

29:03.869 --> 29:04.870
Talk to me, Warren.

29:07.331 --> 29:08.415
You know...

29:11.126 --> 29:13.879
when I used to hunt the Burhmans...

29:15.923 --> 29:17.299
I would...

29:19.760 --> 29:20.928
What?

29:26.433 --> 29:28.936
I would sneak into the twins' room,

29:30.020 --> 29:31.688
hide under Lanie's bed,

29:31.772 --> 29:35.400
and... read her diary.

29:45.786 --> 29:46.787
<i>Did she know?</i>

29:49.039 --> 29:50.040
No.

29:50.707 --> 29:53.627
I was just a kid with a crush.

29:55.045 --> 29:57.047
That's a little more than a crush.

29:57.798 --> 29:59.007
And another lie.

30:04.847 --> 30:06.014
Do you know the code?

30:06.849 --> 30:09.560
That shit is over 20 years old.How am I supposed to remember that?

30:09.643 --> 30:10.644
Try.

30:19.987 --> 30:22.197
I think the symbols may be vowels,

30:22.948 --> 30:24.658
but I'm not sure which ones.

30:25.325 --> 30:27.744
There were a lot of entriesthe week before Chuck died.

30:28.245 --> 30:30.038
This could help us.

30:30.122 --> 30:31.123
Hey. Time's up.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.209
Think, Warren.

30:34.918 --> 30:36.086
Think. Help me.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.596
Teenage girls. Goddamn.

30:46.138 --> 30:48.891
Can we not pass judgmentand just translate this thing?

30:50.559 --> 30:52.561
Warren wouldn't have given me this code

30:52.644 --> 30:55.689
if he didn't think there wassomething in here that we could use.

31:02.237 --> 31:03.864
Jesus Christ.

31:04.656 --> 31:05.741
What?

31:06.491 --> 31:08.160
That sick piece of shit.

31:08.785 --> 31:09.786
Who? Warren?

31:12.831 --> 31:14.499
Chuck was molesting Lanie.

31:16.627 --> 31:20.422
And if Lanie told her mom,it could have been either Erin or Warren.

31:20.839 --> 31:25.260
Look, if a father's molesting her daughterand winds up stabbed, the mom did it.

31:25.344 --> 31:28.263
-You can bank on that.-She did have a shaky alibi too.

31:28.347 --> 31:29.806
Drunk and passed out?

31:30.265 --> 31:31.475
-Come on.-Yeah.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.852
If Lanie told Erin what was going on,

31:33.936 --> 31:36.146
it could have easily have pushed herover the edge.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.315
You think Lanie will give her mom up?

31:38.398 --> 31:40.400
You saw the type of relationshipthey have.

31:40.776 --> 31:42.945
If we press the right buttons,Lanie will turn on her.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.405
So you're back then?

31:46.573 --> 31:48.116
One step at a time.

31:49.076 --> 31:50.827
Thanks again for dinner.

31:50.911 --> 31:52.996
Don't thank me. Thank Alex.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.582
He's the chef. I don't cook, I burn.

31:57.626 --> 32:02.214
I gotta be honest,I was a bit nervous about tonight.

32:02.297 --> 32:03.674
I didn't know what to expect.

32:03.757 --> 32:06.176
But... it wasn't this.

32:06.260 --> 32:10.889
She's worked so hard to cope witheverything that the murder did to her.

32:11.890 --> 32:12.891
Yeah.

32:13.517 --> 32:17.896
Yeah, she... and I havea lot to work through.

32:17.980 --> 32:20.649
But... I love her.

32:21.316 --> 32:22.609
That's so great.

32:22.693 --> 32:24.528
And, hey, at least all the outbursts

32:24.611 --> 32:27.573
and the in and out of institutionsseems to be in check.

32:27.656 --> 32:28.657
Right?

32:28.740 --> 32:31.869
I mean, I was a bit concernedwith the whole Vivienne thing,

32:31.952 --> 32:34.413
but you seem to be so great for her.

32:34.496 --> 32:35.873
You and Mason.

32:38.709 --> 32:40.836
I did want to ask though,

32:41.879 --> 32:43.422
how is she with Mason?

32:43.922 --> 32:45.424
You leave her alone with him?

32:47.593 --> 32:49.553
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

32:49.636 --> 32:50.888
No. No reason. It's...

32:52.514 --> 32:56.018
There were some issuesafter Dad died, but...

32:56.476 --> 32:57.477
Issues?

32:59.605 --> 33:00.731
She...

33:02.357 --> 33:07.154
Well, she tried to...smother me with a pillow once.

33:07.696 --> 33:11.158
Yeah, I woke up.I had to... fight her off.

33:11.241 --> 33:12.784
I mean, I have no idea why she did it,

33:12.868 --> 33:16.205
but I think it probably hadsomething to do with

33:16.663 --> 33:20.459
needing somebody else to feelthe pain that she was feeling.

33:21.376 --> 33:25.923
You know, or maybe she even thoughtit was like an act of mercy.

33:26.006 --> 33:30.302
But... she just snapped.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.182
It was so long ago.

33:36.016 --> 33:39.019
Really. I'm sure she's past all of it.

33:39.436 --> 33:42.231
But I...for whatever reason, I don't know,

33:42.314 --> 33:44.608
I guess it's more my issue at this point,

33:44.691 --> 33:47.444
but I just can't seemto leave her alone with Ella.

33:57.287 --> 33:59.498
Red MINI Cooper. Your car's ready.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.007
What the hell?

34:09.091 --> 34:11.176
-I need to talk to you.-Get out of my car!

34:13.344 --> 34:15.054
You are insane.

34:17.599 --> 34:18.976
How'd you even find me?

34:19.059 --> 34:21.395
I stopped by your office.Your colleague told me where you were.

34:21.478 --> 34:22.938
So you're stalking me.

34:23.021 --> 34:25.065
Why did you lie about seeing Warren?

34:25.148 --> 34:26.775
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

34:26.859 --> 34:28.944
A witness has come forwardwho's willing to go on record

34:29.027 --> 34:31.280
and swear he saw Warren runningfrom the front of your house

34:31.362 --> 34:32.697
at the time of your father's murder.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.533
Now, one of you is lying.

34:34.616 --> 34:36.368
My money's on you.

34:36.451 --> 34:39.204
Remember, I saw the old tapethat resurfaced.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.290
Seriously? Come on.

34:41.373 --> 34:42.623
Move it.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.047
I have nothing to say to you.

34:50.674 --> 34:52.926
Please get out of my car.

34:53.010 --> 34:54.511
-So you weren't lying?-No!

34:54.928 --> 34:55.971
Come on.

34:57.848 --> 34:59.016
Fine!

35:01.476 --> 35:05.147
Next car, please pull forwardand put it in neutral.

35:09.693 --> 35:12.279
Lanie, how longwas your father abusing you?

35:15.949 --> 35:18.410
Consonants move two places to the left.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.996
The ones become vowelsare replaced with symbols.

35:23.207 --> 35:25.209
-I don't want to.-This is not about what you want!

35:25.292 --> 35:27.878
-Dad! Stop! Stop! Let me go!-Okay, you need to do what I say!

35:32.549 --> 35:33.759
Did your mother know?

35:35.511 --> 35:36.887
I don't know.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.347
You can tell me the truth.

35:38.847 --> 35:41.934
Who do you think you are,asking me about this?

35:42.017 --> 35:44.978
Did your mother knowyour father was abusing you?

35:49.149 --> 35:50.275
Yes.

35:50.359 --> 35:52.069
Well, did she do anythingto try to stop it?

35:52.569 --> 35:55.989
Did she kill Chuck and tell you to lieto the police and say you saw Warren?

35:57.991 --> 36:01.078
Everything my mom did, she didto protect me. She didn't kill him.

36:01.161 --> 36:02.871
-But she did coach you.-No.

36:02.955 --> 36:07.251
No. Why can you not just understandwhat everybody else already knows?

36:07.334 --> 36:08.335
Lanie--

36:08.418 --> 36:12.631
Can you even imagine what it's liketo have a father that you idolize,

36:12.714 --> 36:14.675
that then he becomes this...

36:17.803 --> 36:21.098
Everything that that man stood forwas a lie. Everything.

36:21.181 --> 36:23.475
Did that wreck me? Yeah.

36:23.559 --> 36:26.520
Was I institutionalized? Yes, twice.

36:26.603 --> 36:30.065
And it was my motherwho got me through it, okay?

36:31.942 --> 36:35.195
So just please leave me alone!Just leave us alone!

36:38.866 --> 36:39.867
Okay.

36:41.827 --> 36:42.953
Okay.

36:49.835 --> 36:52.087
Mac, does the Chevy need wax?

36:55.424 --> 36:57.676
Please pull your car forwardand put it in neutral.

37:00.554 --> 37:01.638
Markus.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.184
Can you meet me at El Camino and Rayburn?

37:13.817 --> 37:14.943
What are you doing?

37:15.027 --> 37:19.656
What? I left my jacket here the other day.

37:21.074 --> 37:22.534
Hey,

37:22.618 --> 37:25.537
can you help me with somethingwhile your mom's out?

37:25.621 --> 37:30.083
I'm looking for a... toy.

37:30.501 --> 37:34.421
A little metal statue.It's a bird that your mom used to have.

37:35.255 --> 37:40.302
Have you ever seen anything like that?Like, maybe in a special hiding place.

37:42.137 --> 37:43.138
No.

37:46.767 --> 37:47.809
Are you sure?

37:51.605 --> 37:52.981
There are toys in my room.

38:01.823 --> 38:03.825
Well, what do you want me to do?I went to the hospital.

38:04.326 --> 38:07.371
-Lanie's records are sealed.-We gotta find a way to access them.

38:07.454 --> 38:08.580
And why is that exactly?

38:09.039 --> 38:11.917
Lanie's story-- I don't know,something about it doesn't feel right.

38:12.626 --> 38:13.961
Poppy.

38:14.044 --> 38:17.339
You're asking this woman to relivethe most traumatic thing in her life.

38:19.258 --> 38:23.262
Second most, I guess.I don't know. Damn, this is dark.

38:23.345 --> 38:27.015
A doctor might be able to corroborateher story, tell us who coached her.

38:27.099 --> 38:29.476
-Something.-All right. Well, look.

38:32.145 --> 38:35.566
I pulled staff directories from bothof the times she was institutionalized.

38:36.358 --> 38:40.404
There's a lady on the board of directors,last name Dostikas.

38:41.822 --> 38:42.865
Ring a bell?

39:14.479 --> 39:16.273
Let's have us a little fun.

39:17.399 --> 39:19.651
-That's for you.-Tipsy.

39:20.360 --> 39:23.113
I don't need any more.Oh, my God, you're--

39:25.824 --> 39:27.659
I have never seen him like this.

39:28.744 --> 39:31.538
You know,he is always the last one at the office.

39:31.622 --> 39:34.416
He even stays laterthan our clerical staff.

39:34.499 --> 39:36.752
Maybe it's that bad New York spirit.

39:37.461 --> 39:38.670
Yeah, well, maybe it is.

39:38.754 --> 39:42.966
And that New York spirit hassome business to attend to.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.968
Not in the house. You boys. Outside.

39:45.052 --> 39:47.304
-Out. Out.-Fine. Fine by me.

39:47.387 --> 39:49.097
-Young man, follow me.-Sir.

39:49.181 --> 39:51.058
Let me show you what we got out here.

39:51.141 --> 39:53.769
-Thank you for inviting us over.-Of course.

39:53.852 --> 39:55.729
Your home is lovely.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.023
Thank you. Thank you.

39:58.899 --> 40:03.195
Yeah, sometimes I need a wind downafter those partner dinners.

40:03.695 --> 40:04.905
Tell me about it.

40:06.114 --> 40:07.824
Aren't you a lawyer as well?

40:07.908 --> 40:11.328
No. I'm in hospital administration.

40:11.411 --> 40:13.830
The Redwood Institute for Mental Health.

40:15.207 --> 40:18.335
Redwood. Wow. They're world-class.

40:18.418 --> 40:20.963
That's... impressive.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.675
It's not as impressive as a buzzy podcast.

40:24.758 --> 40:26.426
So you've heard it?

40:27.010 --> 40:30.013
Tim says we should support Ingram,but I just like it.

40:30.097 --> 40:32.224
Well, for what it's worth,

40:32.307 --> 40:35.269
I will be returningto my <i>Formidable Women</i> series

40:35.352 --> 40:37.312
once I'm done with Owen Cave.

40:39.064 --> 40:42.067
Maybe you'd like to come on as a guest?

40:45.153 --> 40:46.446
Seriously?

40:47.114 --> 40:52.327
I thought that series wasall Sheryl Sandberg, Kamala Harris types.

40:52.411 --> 40:56.206
No. No. Mental health issuesare in the zeitgeist these days.

40:56.290 --> 40:58.876
And Redwood is cutting edge.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.005
Oh, my God. I would be honored to.

41:03.338 --> 41:06.717
One of the people in the current podcastwas there years ago.

41:07.593 --> 41:09.553
A lot of people come through us.

41:12.222 --> 41:14.975
I know this is sensitive.

41:15.058 --> 41:20.898
But would you know how I couldgo about accessing her medical records?

41:23.358 --> 41:24.610
Excuse me?

41:24.693 --> 41:27.237
If you know the podcast,you know Lanie Buhrman.

41:27.321 --> 41:29.406
She was there as a teenager.

41:33.577 --> 41:36.371
Are you asking meto pull a patient's medical records?

41:36.455 --> 41:37.706
A minor's?

41:37.789 --> 41:41.293
I-- Sharon, I wouldn't be askingif it weren't urgent.

41:41.376 --> 41:46.298
I mean, this could be the keyto getting an innocent man out of prison.

41:47.007 --> 41:48.884
Is that what all of this was for?

41:49.510 --> 41:50.928
The dinner. Staying over.

41:51.011 --> 41:52.179
No, no.

41:52.262 --> 41:54.848
We forgot the cigar cutter.

41:57.309 --> 41:58.352
-Everything okay?-Yeah.

41:58.435 --> 42:00.979
I'm just tired. Can we go?

42:02.439 --> 42:03.774
-But---Tim.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.109
It's time to go.

42:13.492 --> 42:15.202
-Thanks for coming.-Thank you.

42:16.411 --> 42:17.412
Thanks for dinner.

42:18.622 --> 42:19.623
Good night.

42:20.499 --> 42:21.500
Good night.

42:27.589 --> 42:28.590
What just happened?

42:32.594 --> 42:35.097
-I don't have shit to say to you.-Can we just talk about this, please?

42:35.180 --> 42:38.475
You know, it's not just Owen Caveor the ransacking

42:38.559 --> 42:41.270
or even your promisethat you were done with all of this--

42:41.353 --> 42:44.106
-Things changed.-I don't give a damn what changed.

42:44.189 --> 42:46.483
-I didn't know about her diary---Tell me the truth.

42:47.901 --> 42:51.738
Did you deliberately invite Timand his wife here to help your story?

42:51.822 --> 42:52.906
Yes or no?

43:03.876 --> 43:05.794
-You used me.-Where are you going?

43:05.878 --> 43:07.379
I'm spending the nightin the guest bedroom.

43:07.462 --> 43:10.382
Ingram, we don't sleep apart.Especially when we're angry.

43:10.465 --> 43:12.634
You know that.Those are the rules we set up.

43:13.844 --> 43:14.845
Rules?

43:15.762 --> 43:19.308
There are rules?Really? In this relationship?

43:19.391 --> 43:22.436
In this house? With you?I didn't think you had any rules.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.938
I thought you just didwhatever the hell you wanted to do.

43:25.022 --> 43:27.024
-Come on now.-No, you are damaged!

43:28.942 --> 43:31.445
And being back here, on the West Coast,around your family,

43:31.528 --> 43:36.742
I see the dysfunction and the crazythat you all mistake for communication.

43:36.825 --> 43:38.243
But it is twisted.

43:39.244 --> 43:41.622
And it's seeped back in.

43:41.705 --> 43:46.418
And it's made you think thatme being respectful and nice was weak,

43:46.502 --> 43:48.170
and that's your mistake.

43:48.253 --> 43:50.756
-I'm sorry.-I don't care, Poppy!

43:50.839 --> 43:52.508
I do not care!

43:54.301 --> 43:56.970
I am exhausted.

43:59.348 --> 44:01.433
And I don't want to do this much work.

44:02.184 --> 44:04.186
-Ingram, but just---And don't you--

44:04.269 --> 44:07.564
Don't think that I don't see yougrinning in Markus's face

44:07.648 --> 44:10.317
and running around townlike Bonnie and Clyde.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.652
Now, either--

44:12.611 --> 44:15.280
Either you are a foolor, much worse, I am.

44:15.364 --> 44:17.241
No. Ingram.

44:18.909 --> 44:19.910
Oh, God.

44:28.669 --> 44:29.670
Hey.

44:38.387 --> 44:39.429
Josie?

44:42.766 --> 44:44.142
Caleb left me.

44:46.854 --> 44:50.274
God, I don't understand.I thought dinner went so well.

44:51.942 --> 44:55.696
He says that he can't trust me.

45:00.617 --> 45:04.872
Josie, why don't you come home to me?

45:06.164 --> 45:07.457
Stay with me.

45:08.709 --> 45:12.129
If you stay with me,then I can take care of you.

45:19.469 --> 45:20.470
Okay.

45:25.309 --> 45:27.936
<i>Two hundred and fifty pieces.We can start now if you want.</i>

45:29.104 --> 45:31.106
<i>What do you think, Lanie?Pretty cool, huh?</i>

45:31.190 --> 45:33.275
<i>Do you wanna come up here,we'll do it together?</i>

45:33.358 --> 45:34.401
<i>No.</i>

45:34.484 --> 45:36.153
-<i>No? You sure?</i>-<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

45:36.236 --> 45:37.237
<i>Okay.</i>

45:38.197 --> 45:39.198
<i>Lanie.</i>

45:40.157 --> 45:41.700
<i>Want me to help or you got it?</i>

45:41.783 --> 45:43.952
-<i>Put 'em in the box.</i>-<i>Okay.</i>

45:55.380 --> 46:00.844
"When this story started,I made a promise to find the truth.

46:02.262 --> 46:05.432
What I didn't know waswhere the story would take me

46:05.516 --> 46:10.646
as I looked for the answersof what really happened to Chuck Buhrman.

46:13.273 --> 46:20.072
<i>This case has taken me to a placeI didn't know I could go.</i>

46:22.115 --> 46:23.575
<i>It's been maddening.</i>

46:24.910 --> 46:26.161
<i>Terrifying.</i>

46:27.704 --> 46:29.456
<i>And it's made me question everything.</i>

46:34.294 --> 46:36.588
<i>Have I been helping a murderer?</i>

46:39.049 --> 46:43.804
<i>Have I risked...even more than I can know?</i>

46:47.140 --> 46:49.726
<i>Have I been played by a sociopath?</i>

46:52.104 --> 46:54.940
<i>I don't know the answer to that question.</i>

46:56.608 --> 47:00.070
And that is what scares me the most."

47:30.184 --> 47:35.355
You have no ideawhat I've done for this family.

47:38.609 --> 47:41.820
<i>Did you recognize the individualwho jumped the back fence?</i>

47:42.863 --> 47:45.282
<i>Go ahead. Say it.</i>

47:46.325 --> 47:48.827
<i>Yes. It was Warren.</i>

47:49.870 --> 47:55.334
You don't realizewhat I've sacrificed for Josie...

47:58.754 --> 47:59.755
for you.

48:04.426 --> 48:06.762
<i>...the individualwho jumped the back fence?</i>

48:08.680 --> 48:11.183
<i>Go ahead. Say it.</i>

48:12.309 --> 48:13.310
<i>Yes.</i>

48:17.564 --> 48:19.066
Why did you lie, Lanie?

48:19.900 --> 48:21.360
Who were you looking at?

48:31.411 --> 48:33.705
What are you hiding?
