00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.611
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.613 --> 00:14.847
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.849 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:19.952
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.954 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.457
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.459 --> 00:29.395
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.397 --> 00:33.465
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.467 --> 00:36.468
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.470 --> 00:38.137
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.139 --> 00:40.539
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.541 --> 00:42.975
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.977 --> 00:45.477
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.479 --> 00:51.617
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:00.761 --> 01:02.761
Hi, Vivian.
How was your summer?

01:02.763 --> 01:04.430
It was great, Sofia.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.832
I went to a music festival,
an opera,

01:06.834 --> 01:11.203
three ballets, and made you
a floating friendship bracelet.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.604
Oh, thanks.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.707
Welcome back to
Royal Prep, children.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.911
A most exciting new
school year awaits.

01:18.913 --> 01:21.613
New classrooms,
new teachers,

01:21.615 --> 01:22.848
new challenges.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.451
So let's get started
right away.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.219
New students,

01:27.221 --> 01:30.456
please report to
the Noble Novice classroom.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.959
And for those of you
moving up to the Regal Rotunda,

01:33.961 --> 01:35.627
come this way.

01:35.629 --> 01:39.064
And for those special students
starting the new year

01:39.066 --> 01:40.899
in the one and only
Majestic Hall,

01:40.901 --> 01:43.135
line up and follow me.

01:44.972 --> 01:48.640
I can't believe we're
finally in Majestic Hall!

01:48.642 --> 01:51.210
Exactly the right place
for me to be.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.612
It just means there's
gonna be more tests

01:53.614 --> 01:55.714
and harder homework.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.316
I know.
Isn't it great?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.917
Uh, not for me.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.487
Don't worry, James.
I'll still help you

02:01.489 --> 02:03.455
- with your homework
whenever you need it.
- Thanks, Desmond.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.657
And here we are.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.493
Majestic Hall.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.898
Welcome to
your new classroom, children.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.933
Please meet
your new teacher,

02:14.935 --> 02:17.302
Professor Pecullian.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.139
Call me Mr. P.!

02:20.141 --> 02:23.675
I can already see that you are
quite the curious collection

02:23.677 --> 02:25.978
of inquisitive
young minds.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.749
This will be a wonderful year of
wondering wonderful things.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.950
So we won't delay.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.085
Take a seat.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.686
Or squat on the floor.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.523
Or on the ceiling
if you can reach it.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.458
Off you go.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.261
Have a great first day,
my dears.

02:42.263 --> 02:45.330
Book, book, pencil,
sharpener, backup pencil,

02:45.332 --> 02:46.865
more books,
brand-new eraser.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.767
I treated myself.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.636
( sighs happily )
I'm ready to learn.

02:50.638 --> 02:54.373
Students, this is
a big year,

02:54.375 --> 02:56.642
and so, I want everyone
to look at things...

02:56.644 --> 02:58.677
( chuckles )
differently.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.546
( all exclaiming )

03:00.548 --> 03:02.181
My books!

03:02.183 --> 03:04.650
What is
happening?

03:04.652 --> 03:07.152
Just shaking it up a bit.

03:07.154 --> 03:10.722
Expanding your views,
and hopefully, your minds.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.191
I don't like it.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.992
It is different,
but kind of fun.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.627
I think it's brilliant.

03:15.629 --> 03:19.364
Look. I never noticed that
the floor tiles form a picture.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.733
My point exactly, princess!

03:21.735 --> 03:24.570
With every new view,
you have new insights,

03:24.572 --> 03:26.738
and new out sights.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.808
Mr. P., is class always
gonna be upside down?

03:29.810 --> 03:32.411
I'm so glad you asked.
No.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.749
Sometimes it will be
sideways.

03:38.819 --> 03:39.651
Oh, please, no.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.919
Or diagonal.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.722
Can't we just learn
right side up

03:43.724 --> 03:45.791
like every other class
I've ever been in?

03:48.028 --> 03:50.562
- My book!
- Allow me.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.431
Thank you.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.933
Ah, but today, we won't
be using books.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.736
Books are wonderful,
of course.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.206
They're bounded blocks
of boundless information.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.076
But right now, we're going
to learn by doing

04:04.078 --> 04:06.245
- instead of reading.
- Excellent.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.080
Excuse me.
I don't understand.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.349
How do you learn
without books?

04:10.351 --> 04:13.619
Allow me to explain.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.755
¶ Books are really great
for learning facts ¶

04:16.757 --> 04:18.757
¶ For finding out who,
what, when and why ¶

04:18.759 --> 04:21.727
¶ But sometimes, you have to
push aside the stacks ¶

04:21.729 --> 04:26.265
¶ And take a step
into the world outside ¶

04:26.267 --> 04:29.034
¶ If you want to feel
the thrill of the ocean ¶

04:29.036 --> 04:31.703
¶ As a mermaid guides your ship
through her realm ¶

04:31.705 --> 04:35.207
¶ You will never know
the surge of emotion ¶

04:35.209 --> 04:40.646
¶ Until you climb aboard
and step up to the helm ¶

04:40.648 --> 04:43.615
¶ You gotta live it
to learn it ¶

04:43.617 --> 04:46.285
¶ You gotta dive in
and do it ¶

04:46.287 --> 04:48.987
¶ You gotta show
that you know it ¶

04:48.989 --> 04:54.760
¶ And work your way
through it ¶

04:54.762 --> 04:57.763
¶ You can read about
King Arthur's knights ¶

04:57.765 --> 05:00.766
¶ A book will tell you
every tale and plot ¶

05:00.768 --> 05:03.969
¶ But if you want to witness
their true might ¶

05:03.971 --> 05:08.073
¶ Well, try shaking hands
with Sir Lancelot ¶

05:08.075 --> 05:11.143
¶ If you want to grow
a beautiful flower ¶

05:11.145 --> 05:13.945
¶ Dig into the dirt
like a gnome or an elf ¶

05:13.947 --> 05:17.582
¶ Can't tell if a fruit
will be sweet or sour ¶

05:17.584 --> 05:22.921
¶ Till you take a bite
and find out for yourself ¶

05:22.923 --> 05:25.357
¶ You gotta live it
to learn it ¶

05:25.359 --> 05:28.327
¶ You gotta dive in
and do it ¶

05:28.329 --> 05:31.530
¶ You gotta show
that you know it ¶

05:31.532 --> 05:36.768
¶ Just work your way
through it ¶

05:36.770 --> 05:38.537
Some of you look uneasy.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.806
Maybe even queasy.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.040
That's natural.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.709
My methods are
entirely new to you.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.111
So remember, if you're
ever lost in the woods,

05:46.113 --> 05:49.047
don't be afraid to ask
for directions.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.816
Woods? What woods?

05:50.818 --> 05:53.051
I don't understand
anything he's saying.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.354
I think he means that
we should ask for help
if we need it.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.789
I think I wanna ask
for a different class.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.459
¶ You gotta live it
to learn it ¶

06:00.461 --> 06:03.128
¶ You gotta dive in
and do it ¶

06:03.130 --> 06:05.831
¶ So don't sweat it
'cause you'll get it ¶

06:05.833 --> 06:09.134
¶ Just set your mind to it ¶

06:09.136 --> 06:11.336
¶ You gotta live it
to learn it ¶

06:11.338 --> 06:12.871
¶ Live it
to learn it ¶

06:12.873 --> 06:14.373
¶ You gotta dive in
and do it ¶

06:14.375 --> 06:15.841
¶ Dive in and do it ¶

06:15.843 --> 06:17.743
¶ You gotta show
that you know it ¶

06:17.745 --> 06:20.212
¶ Show that you know it ¶

06:20.214 --> 06:23.482
¶ Just work your way
through it ¶

06:23.484 --> 06:27.018
¶ Live it to learn it ¶

06:27.020 --> 06:28.820
Now then, students,

06:28.822 --> 06:31.723
let's talk about
our first class assignment.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.193
It is going to be
a gardening project.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.196
Finally something
I know how to do,
and that I'm good at.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.198
You're good at
everything, Des.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.835
Yes, but I'm especially good
at enchanted gardening.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.004
Ah, well, then I've got
some important news for you.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.572
It's not
enchanted gardening.

06:47.574 --> 06:51.676
- It is mystery gardening.
- What is that?

06:51.678 --> 06:54.846
Why, it's a mystery,
of course, young prince.

06:54.848 --> 06:59.017
Pop. Pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.552
And pop, pop, pop, pop.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.687
Oh, hello.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.222
Spiky. I like it.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.957
I'm going to name you
Piney.

07:05.959 --> 07:09.628
Each mystery tree
is unique,

07:09.630 --> 07:11.730
just like each of you
is unique.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.065
And the mystery
you must solve

07:14.067 --> 07:16.902
is to figure out
what your little tree needs

07:16.904 --> 07:19.037
to thrive,
and remember,

07:19.039 --> 07:21.039
each one will need
something different.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.074
How will we know
when our tree is thriving?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.544
Excellent question.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.612
It's thriving
when it grows fruit.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.214
Yum.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.882
And it gets yummier.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.285
When every tree has
sprouted fruit,

07:33.287 --> 07:38.056
we will make
magical mystery jam.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.624
But, Mr. P.,

07:39.626 --> 07:41.393
how do we figure out
what our trees need?

07:41.395 --> 07:44.296
By doing. Go outside
and experiment with them!

07:44.298 --> 07:45.964
( all gasping )

07:45.966 --> 07:49.468
Look, listen, touch,
taste if you have to.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.069
Just do whatever
you need to do

07:51.071 --> 07:53.505
to discover what
your particular tree needs.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.841
Time to start doing.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.542
And going!

07:58.846 --> 07:59.911
Des, are you coming?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.847
You guys go and... do.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.882
I'm just gonna look for
the right book.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.918
I've gotta have
a mystery gardening book
in here somewhere.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.854
I doubt that, because
there aren't many books

08:08.856 --> 08:10.522
on mystery gardening.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.923
No books?!

08:11.925 --> 08:13.458
'Fraid not.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.327
But do you have
any questions,

08:15.329 --> 08:17.095
because I am
here to help.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.697
And here, and here,
and here.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.298
No, that's okay.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.867
I don't need help
with school.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.335
Never have, never will.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.471
It's true. He's the one
who helps everyone else.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.373
You must be
so busy.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.108
But for now, out you go.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.410
Go forth and make fruit!

08:36.884 --> 08:39.184
What do you need,
my little green sprout?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.887
Are you warm? Cold?
Are you thirsty?

08:41.889 --> 08:43.421
Do you like cheese?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.959
No. Broccoli?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.428
Don't blame you.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.965
Pudding?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.172
Yes! You like pudding.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.974
My favorite, too.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.409
Check it out.
My plant is thriving

09:04.411 --> 09:07.212
on pudding!

09:07.214 --> 09:09.014
Well done.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.882
It's our first fruit.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.751
I finished first?

09:12.753 --> 09:15.854
I've never finished first
at anything in school.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.023
I'm first in the class.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.225
Boom goes the cannon.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.928
( imitates cannon firing )

09:25.766 --> 09:27.732
Why isn't mine growing?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.668
Maybe a little water.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.436
( frustrated groan )

09:31.438 --> 09:33.104
Nothing!

09:33.106 --> 09:34.339
- ( popping sound )
- Oh, I got fruit.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.440
( nervous chuckle )

09:35.442 --> 09:38.743
Sofia, my tree thrives
when I hum to it. Look.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.180
( humming )

09:42.182 --> 09:44.449
( popping noises )

09:44.451 --> 09:45.951
What?!

09:45.953 --> 09:47.586
I figured mine out, too.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.188
It grows a fruit whenever
I give it a compliment.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.023
Allow me to demonstrate.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.359
You are so adorable.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.195
And you have
the prettiest fruit.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.064
- ( loud popping )
- Yes!

09:59.066 --> 10:02.200
You are the best little
tree in the whole world!

10:02.202 --> 10:04.035
Hmm.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.005
I still haven't figured out
what mine needs.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.977
How'd you get it
to do that?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.244
I don't know.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.880
( popping )

10:15.882 --> 10:16.982
It did it again.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.817
Hm.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.058
I think my tree
likes being next
to other trees.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.994
That's it!

10:28.996 --> 10:30.495
It thrives on friends.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.230
How sweet.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.565
Look at that.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.600
Answers are
popping up everywhere.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.502
Phooey! Everyone else
found answers.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.804
Why can't I?

10:39.806 --> 10:43.241
Wait a second.
Everyone else found answers.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.610
Maybe their answers
will work for me.

10:45.612 --> 10:48.146
( humming )

10:48.148 --> 10:49.648
Oh! ( giggles )

10:51.318 --> 10:53.852
( humming )

10:57.758 --> 11:00.125
Guess that's
the wrong answer.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.127
( popping )

11:02.129 --> 11:04.763
Ah, maybe pudding will work.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.500
Here you go.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.941
You are so adorable.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.713
( sighs )
Fine.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.717
You are so adorable.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.120
Oh. Sorry, Des.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.655
I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.824
Still figuring it out.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.626
Do you need
any help?

11:34.628 --> 11:37.796
'Cause Mr. P.'s
right over there.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.631
No, I do not need
any help.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.133
This is a school
project, Sofia,

11:42.135 --> 11:44.002
and school is
what I do best.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.371
I'm gonna solve this
my way.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.472
In the library.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.940
With a book.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.246
There has got to be
some kind of book

11:55.248 --> 11:59.651
with some kind of information
on mystery gardening.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.422
<i> Enchanted Gardening,</i>
<i> Enchanted Gardening,</i>

12:04.424 --> 12:06.091
<i> Very Enchanted Gardening.</i>

12:09.062 --> 12:10.829
<i> Mystery Gardening.</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:15.133
What?!

12:18.538 --> 12:22.273
It's a mystery!
( yells )

12:22.275 --> 12:25.076
Desmond, you really
don't sound okay.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.344
Whaaaat?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.179
What are you talking about?

12:28.181 --> 12:31.516
I'm... I'm...
I'm not okay at all.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.551
I've never had
this much trouble at school.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.887
I've never had
any trouble.

12:35.889 --> 12:39.057
I used to be really, really,
really good at school,

12:39.059 --> 12:42.627
and now I'm struggling
just to finish
our first project.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.296
You know, sometimes even
the best students,

12:45.298 --> 12:48.299
the smartest kids,
need a little help,

12:48.301 --> 12:49.734
and it's okay.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.369
No, it's not.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.971
I shouldn't need help,

12:52.973 --> 12:55.373
especially when
no one else does.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.276
( Mr. P. humming )

12:58.278 --> 12:59.778
Mr. P.?

12:59.780 --> 13:02.113
What are you doing here,
and how are you doing?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.949
We are great.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.151
Totally great.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.452
Des.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.320
Don't say anything.
Please.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.055
Everything is
really good.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.557
Fantastic.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.925
That must mean
fruit is fruiting.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.060
Oh, yeah.
Lots of it.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.762
Jolly green good.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.564
That means everyone
has fruit now,

13:19.566 --> 13:22.233
so forth we go then
to the next project.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.002
Making mystery jam.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.637
What?

13:25.639 --> 13:27.338
- Gather up your fruit.
- Now?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.507
No. Now's way too soon.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.809
Oh, great.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.178
I mean, I'm completely
ready now,

13:33.180 --> 13:34.979
but later's okay, too.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.415
Oh, good.
We're on the same
page then.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.017
So how's five minutes
from now?

13:39.019 --> 13:40.819
We'll meet back in
the classroom.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.754
Um, Desmond.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.356
are you sure there's
not something you want
to ask Mr. P.?

13:45.358 --> 13:47.325
Nope. Nothing.
See you soon,

13:47.327 --> 13:50.995
with lots
and lots of fruit.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.202
What have I done?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.803
You've given yourself
five minutes

13:58.805 --> 14:00.705
to make your tree
grow fruit.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.607
I'm doomed.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.309
I could try
to help you.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.944
Or maybe James could.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.846
He seems to really
understand this project.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.281
I do not need help
from James,

14:10.283 --> 14:12.851
or anyone else.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.253
I'll be fine, okay?

14:20.827 --> 14:22.493
I think I know
what to do now.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.195
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.397
Yes. See ya in class.
Bye. Thanks. Buh-bye.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.199
Okay, bye.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.305
Okay, I need answers
somewhere fast.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.007
Let's see.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.876
Enchanted gardening can't be
that different

14:37.878 --> 14:39.978
from mystery gardening.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.416
Fruit, fruit, fruit.
Aha!

14:45.418 --> 14:47.685
To make an enchanted tree
bear fruit,

14:47.687 --> 14:49.420
add three pinches

14:49.422 --> 14:52.056
and half a smidgen of
enchanted plant food.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.193
Done. Then add
two ladybugs?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.728
Okay.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.498
That should do it.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.168
Yes. Finally.
Something is happening.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.084
Stop! Not that!
Slow down!

15:25.959 --> 15:27.191
What's wrong with you?

15:32.933 --> 15:35.533
( panting )

15:40.540 --> 15:42.440
Psst.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.709
Des? What's wrong?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.577
I, um, I think I might need...

15:46.579 --> 15:48.980
help.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.548
Huh?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.650
I don't know
what happened.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.552
I did exactly what
the book told me to do,

15:54.554 --> 15:56.654
and then the tree
started shaking,

15:56.656 --> 15:58.623
and then...
and then...

15:58.625 --> 16:01.492
it turned into some kind
of little tree monster,

16:01.494 --> 16:04.228
and then destroyed
the entire greenhouse.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.831
Oh. Yikes.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.434
Um, where is it?

16:09.436 --> 16:10.802
I locked it in.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.071
Or I thought I did.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.841
Des, is this the book
you used on your tree?

16:16.843 --> 16:19.177
An enchanted gardening book?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.645
I thought it would make
that tree grow

16:20.647 --> 16:22.780
just one piece
of tiny fruit,

16:22.782 --> 16:25.183
not turn it into
an unfruiting fiend.

16:25.185 --> 16:29.153
Oh. You must've not gotten
to the last page in the chapter.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.322
No, because it came
after me first.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.358
Well, it says,

16:33.360 --> 16:36.427
"Never, ever, ever use
enchanted gardening

16:36.429 --> 16:38.429
on mystery plants.
Ever."

16:38.431 --> 16:40.365
Oh, no. Please tell me
there's another page

16:40.367 --> 16:42.166
that says
how to undo it.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.935
Actually, there is.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.603
- Really?
- Yes.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.538
"Sprinkle two heaps
of blue anti food,

16:47.540 --> 16:48.639
spin, re-pot."

16:48.641 --> 16:50.541
We have to find
that thing

16:50.543 --> 16:52.510
before Mr. P. does.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.612
I think it went
that way.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.618
At least it's not
hard to follow.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.786
Over there.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.625
( groaning )

17:12.565 --> 17:13.898
Sh.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.300
( snoring )

17:19.839 --> 17:21.272
Come back here!

17:24.310 --> 17:26.144
Oh!

17:26.146 --> 17:28.579
How about you go that way,
I go this way

17:28.581 --> 17:30.548
- and we corner it?
- Sounds good.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.899
Gotcha!

17:47.901 --> 17:49.467
I got it,
I got it!

17:56.042 --> 17:58.543
Anti food.
Now spin it.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.710
I thought I was.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.679
I think it's just
spinning you.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.581
- Pot!
- Pot.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.190
It's fixed.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.925
Phew.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.760
What's...
what's happening?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.028
I don't know.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.099
Oh, now it's even
worse than before.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.769
It's like the saddest
little tree in
the whole universe.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.772
I am not the best student
in the class anymore.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.907
I'm not even
in the middle.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.310
I'm at the bottom
of the bottom.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.945
Des, it's okay.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.713
It's not over yet.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.282
Really? Because to me,
it looks pretty over.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.985
Well, you could still ask
Mr. P. for help.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.920
- ( groans )
- Come on.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.655
What's the worst
that could happen?

18:44.657 --> 18:48.259
Hello, my fellow students.
Need help with anything?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.728
Plucking, peeling,
squishing, squashing?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.965
No, thank you, James.
We're good.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.833
You sure, 'cause I was
first in the class

18:55.835 --> 18:58.970
to get fruit,
so I really know
what I'm doing.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.572
Um, excuse me,
Professor Pecullian.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.275
Ah, my last two students.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.943
Do you come
bearing fruit?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.645
Not exactly.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.015
Then do you come
bearing explanations?

19:11.017 --> 19:13.518
Okay, so the thing is,

19:13.520 --> 19:16.921
well... I need help.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.523
Desmond needs help?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.124
What?
I don't believe it.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.594
Yes, I actually
do need help.
A lot of it.

19:23.596 --> 19:27.632
I so admire a student
who can ask for help.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.467
Let me tell you a secret.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.002
Aah!

19:31.004 --> 19:34.539
Even I need help
every once in a while.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.041
Like, um, I just can't
get this jar open.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.643
Little help?

19:38.645 --> 19:40.511
Uh, sure.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.449
Thanks.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.218
( gasps )

19:47.220 --> 19:49.020
As I pointed out earlier,

19:49.022 --> 19:51.789
sometimes when
you're stuck,

19:51.791 --> 19:53.724
it helps to look at things
from a new way.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.626
You mean in a new way?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.361
No. From a new way.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.630
Now let's see if you can't
solve your mystery

19:59.632 --> 20:01.999
with a few clues.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.467
Okay.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.636
There's one.
Princess Vivian.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.738
Her tree
responded to music.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.707
I already tried that
on mine.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.976
( shudders )
Did not go well.

20:11.978 --> 20:15.246
And James' tree,
it's responded to pudding.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.981
Yeah. Tried that, too.

20:16.983 --> 20:20.685
Yes, but think about
what these solutions
all have in common.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.687
The answer to
the bigger mystery

20:22.689 --> 20:26.824
of mystery plants lies in
what connects them all.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.726
Ah, here's one more.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.430
Princess Amber's
responded to compliments.

20:32.432 --> 20:36.234
Your fruit is
unbelievably delicious.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.103
Ooh!

20:39.105 --> 20:42.540
Oh! Vivian
really likes music,

20:42.542 --> 20:44.775
and her tree
thrived on music.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.444
James really likes pudding,

20:46.446 --> 20:48.379
and so did his tree.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.782
And Amber really likes
compliments.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.718
I feel
a breakthrough coming.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.186
Let's hit the ground.

20:55.188 --> 20:59.390
So each tree likes
what each of us likes.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.392
I bet that's why your tree
was going after

21:01.394 --> 21:03.394
all the books
in the library.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.896
Yes. It must like books.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.298
Because you like books.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.934
Now test your theory.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.808
"Jack and the Beanstalk."

21:17.810 --> 21:19.310
Keep going,
keep going.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.711
"Once upon a time,

21:20.713 --> 21:23.648
there was a young boy
named Jack."

21:23.650 --> 21:26.384
Yes! Yes! Yes!

21:28.988 --> 21:30.655
All right, Desmond!

21:30.657 --> 21:32.790
You finally got that tree
to grow some fruit.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.825
You certainly did.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.794
- And you know
what's what?
- What?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.897
This entire class
succeeded in growing fruit,

21:39.899 --> 21:42.967
but only you solved
the greater underlying mystery

21:42.969 --> 21:45.069
of the mystery plants--

21:45.071 --> 21:49.774
that each plant was matched
precisely to each one of you.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.976
I guess that's true.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.611
- Great job.
- Congratulations, Desmond.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.413
Thanks.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.683
wait. So does that mean I'm not
the best in the class anymore?

21:58.685 --> 22:00.685
You, James, are thriving.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.420
I'll take it.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.921
Well done, me.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.257
All right, class, there's
just one more stop

22:06.259 --> 22:08.459
on this magical mystery tour.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.595
It's time to make
mystery jam.

22:11.597 --> 22:14.265
- In here?
- No, no, no.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.334
In the jam-nasium.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.936
Let's jam!
