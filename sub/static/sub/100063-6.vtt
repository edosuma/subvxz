they're my clients

Yes. I hope it's important.

was last night.

Thanks for sharing, kid.

Back in my day, we used to keep
that kind of thing to ourselves.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.066
It was called

04:15.080 --> 04:17.387
I got a prostate
the size of an orange,

04:17.431 --> 04:18.736

but...

04:18.780 --> 04:20.303
Anyway, I got to go
under the knife.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.305
I guess the way
they cut away at this thing

is they run a rod
up your urethra.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.679

to Harry, Magnum,

04:48.723 --> 04:52.292
but why would Abby hire him
and not just come to you?

05:10.788 --> 05:13.008
this job is kind of
time-sensitive.

06:02.231 --> 06:05.669

cover for him.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.803
So...?

06:08.846 --> 06:11.066
I don't think
it's a good idea

06:11.109 --> 06:12.415
to mix personal
with professional.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.113
Things can get messy.

06:17.855 --> 06:18.813
Okay,

06:18.856 --> 06:22.207
I-I-I get that,
but, uh,

06:22.251 --> 06:26.255
Higgins and I already agreed
to take the case.

06:26.298 --> 06:29.301
I really wish
you hadn't.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.695
Harry said

06:31.739 --> 06:33.218
you needed
the job done fast,

and who else is gonna
be able to work the case

06:35.743 --> 06:39.616
on such short notice and with
as much dedication as I would?

06:39.660 --> 06:42.837
Probably no one.
Right.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.316
We're professionals, okay?

06:44.360 --> 06:48.843
We can keep our personal
and professional lives separate.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.758
In the interest of time, okay,

06:50.801 --> 06:54.414
I guess I can try
to make it work.

06:54.457 --> 06:58.418
I'll go get changed
and, uh, catch you guys up.

07:00.681 --> 07:03.292
So I recently defended local
English professor and novelist

07:03.335 --> 07:05.468
Neal Conlan
in a murder trial.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.384
He was charged with killing
his teaching assistant,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.473
Tabitha Hall.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.214
I remember hearing
about it on the news.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.869
Uh, prosecution argued
it was a love affair gone bad.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.087
Yeah.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.176
Witnesses testified
their relationship

07:18.220 --> 07:20.744
was unusually close.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.877
They spent a lot of time
together outside the classroom,

07:22.920 --> 07:24.313
including off campus.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.402
Weren't there e-mails
that showed he was upset

07:26.446 --> 07:28.317
when Tabitha got involved
with a new boyfriend?

07:28.360 --> 07:31.102
Yes, but I argued that
he was just frustrated

07:31.146 --> 07:32.495
that her relationship
was interfering

07:32.539 --> 07:33.670
with her T.A. duties.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.150
Although, it didn't help

07:35.193 --> 07:38.066
our case that he was the last
person to see her alive.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.285
They worked together
the weekend she disappeared.

07:40.329 --> 07:43.375
I remember when HPD found
her car abandoned by the beach.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.334
There was blood all over it--
her blood.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.336
Sounds like the prosecution
had a decent case.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.337
Yes,

07:48.380 --> 07:49.947
but it was hard to prove

07:49.991 --> 07:51.949
because they never
found Tabitha's body.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.429
Plus,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.344
there were plenty
of other suspects with motives

07:55.387 --> 07:58.129
and means to kill her:
the jealous boyfriend,

07:58.173 --> 08:00.523
roommate who owed her money,
rival teaching assistants.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.742
Long list.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.744
And that's what led
to the hung jury.

08:03.787 --> 08:07.530
That doesn't mean that the P.A.
won't retry Conlan,

08:07.574 --> 08:10.751
but if I could find
Tabitha's body,

08:10.794 --> 08:12.535
it could implicate one
of these other suspects,

08:12.579 --> 08:14.319
and finally prove
that my client

08:14.363 --> 08:15.625
had nothing to do
with the murder.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.193
So the job
is to find her corpse?

08:18.236 --> 08:19.281
Yeah.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.635
Thomas, is there a problem?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.637
No, no.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.987
We got this.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.825
What's wrong?

08:41.869 --> 08:43.871
What makes you think
anything's wrong?

08:43.914 --> 08:46.395
Silence isn't like you
and it's--

08:46.438 --> 08:48.658
dare I say it--
it's kind of worrying.

08:48.702 --> 08:52.444
I guess this job
just doesn't make sense.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.142
It makes perfect sense.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.709
Keeping your
personal life separate

08:55.752 --> 08:57.580
from your professional one
is a good policy.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.277
No, that's not what I mean.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.366
If we locate Tabitha's body,

09:01.410 --> 09:03.455
the cops could find
forensic evidence

09:03.499 --> 09:05.283
that would implicate Conlan.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.590
Now, Abby's
a good lawyer.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.636
Why risk it?

09:09.679 --> 09:11.638
Perhaps because
she's just convinced

09:11.681 --> 09:13.857
of her client's innocence.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.777
Can't talk about
the Conlan case.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.910
We're working with the defense,
so whatever you have,

09:22.953 --> 09:25.347
we are entitled to it.KATSUMOTO: Thanks, Magnum.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.741
I know the rules pertaining
to the discovery process.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.307
Great, so it's time to share.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.096
Okay, look,

09:35.139 --> 09:37.794
you didn't hear this from me,

09:37.838 --> 09:40.710
but there's nothing to share
because there is no case.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.234
I thought Mr. Conlan's murder
trial result in a hung jury?

09:43.278 --> 09:46.020
Yeah, but the prosecution's
not retrying it.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.151
Did someone tell his lawyer?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.110
KATSUMOTO: Well, I
assume she was there

09:49.153 --> 09:50.851
when the prosecutor
told the judge in chambers.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.069
Apparently the P.A.
doesn't think

09:52.113 --> 09:53.462
he has enough evidence
to convict Conlan.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.899
Plans to announce it
publicly in a day or two.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.600
We done?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.037
Thank you, Detective.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.387
Yeah.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.694
Why does Abby want us
to find a body

10:07.737 --> 10:09.391
for a murder trial
that isn't happening?

10:09.434 --> 10:12.699
I told you
something was off.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.006
MAGNUM:
Abby,

10:16.050 --> 10:19.009
so what's really
going on here?

10:22.056 --> 10:24.711
Okay.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.677
During the trial,

10:34.721 --> 10:37.158
I really thought that
Conlan was innocent,

10:37.201 --> 10:40.814
but after the hung jury,

10:40.857 --> 10:43.817
he published this.

10:43.860 --> 10:47.342
His second novel,
Strange Desire.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.562
It's a dark coming-of-age story
about a young woman

10:50.606 --> 10:52.303
who is eerily similar
to Tabitha

10:52.347 --> 10:53.870
with intimate
details

10:53.914 --> 10:56.220
that only somebody who had had
a personal relationship

10:56.264 --> 10:57.221
with her would know.

10:57.265 --> 11:00.094
I mean,
things I uncovered that

11:00.137 --> 11:01.573
never came up in court,

11:01.617 --> 11:04.098
that the prosecution and
everybody else was not privy to.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.360
Like what?
Like...

11:05.403 --> 11:07.492
Tabitha's favorite perfume, uh,

11:07.536 --> 11:10.147
playlists, what she slept in.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.106
Look,

11:12.149 --> 11:15.718
the novel appears to reveal a
psychopathic obsession with her.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.981
I've been a criminal
defense attorney

11:18.025 --> 11:18.939
a long time.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.637
I've spent
hundreds of hours

11:21.681 --> 11:24.988
with Conlan, and now
every fiber in my being

11:25.032 --> 11:27.077
tells me that
he murdered this girl

11:27.121 --> 11:29.776
and that her body's out there
and may never be found.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.342
And because of me,

11:31.386 --> 11:33.954
this animal
will walk the streets.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.869
You're not trying to find
Tabitha's body

11:35.912 --> 11:37.566
to defend Conlan...

11:37.609 --> 11:40.003
You want to bury the bastard.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.146
Why weren't you straight
with me from the start?

11:52.189 --> 11:54.235
Because what I'm doing
violates every oath

11:54.278 --> 11:56.541
I've ever taken
as a lawyer.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.239
Betraying my
client's trust,

11:58.282 --> 12:00.545
revealing confidential
information,

12:00.589 --> 12:02.983
being disloyal.But it's the right thing to do.

12:03.026 --> 12:07.639
Morally, but not legally,
or ethically.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.033
I could get
disbarred for this.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.993
And anybody who helps me
could also pay a price.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.038
I would never want
to put you or Higgins

12:15.082 --> 12:16.648
in that type of
compromising position.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.781
Yeah, that's not
what matters to me,

12:18.825 --> 12:21.088
or Higgins.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.959
Look, we could take
the lead on this.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.918
You don't have to risk
your license.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.007
I can't ask you to do that.You're not.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.052
We want to.

12:29.096 --> 12:32.229
[chuckles] You know,
my whole career,

12:32.273 --> 12:34.144
I've always identified
with my clients.

12:34.188 --> 12:37.669
The innocent,
the wrongfully accused.

12:37.713 --> 12:41.238
Maybe I was just
convincing myself

12:41.282 --> 12:42.674
that they were being
treated unfairly

12:42.718 --> 12:45.199
so that I could do the job.
[chuckles]

12:45.242 --> 12:48.332
Let's get this guy.

12:55.557 --> 12:58.168
From these reports,
it appears that HPD

12:58.212 --> 12:59.822
were quite thorough
in their search for Tabitha.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.042
I mean, they spent weeks
scouring every place

13:02.085 --> 13:03.652
she frequented
and where she was last seen.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.132
And yet they
turned up nothing.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.134
It's possible that
they missed something.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.266
Some kind of clue.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.443
What about you, Abby?
Anything in your notes?

13:12.487 --> 13:13.967
You spent a lot
of time with Conlan.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.360
No, he was careful
not to provide any leads

13:16.404 --> 13:18.449
about where
she might be.

13:18.493 --> 13:21.235
What if we're going about this
the wrong way,

13:21.278 --> 13:22.540
looking through files
and notes for leads?

13:22.584 --> 13:24.064
If we want
to find her body,

13:24.107 --> 13:26.370
we should get Conlan
to lead us to it.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.024
By making him think
he has a reason to go to it.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.374
That's brilliant.What'd you say I was again?

13:30.418 --> 13:31.941
I didn't mean
you were brilliant,

13:31.985 --> 13:33.943
I meant the idea.[chuckles] You know
how to do it, right?

13:33.987 --> 13:35.466
Yeah, we give him a good scare.

13:40.384 --> 13:43.257
[overlapping chatter]

13:44.693 --> 13:46.695
Sorry.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.960
I had no idea
you were coming by.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.006
Sorry I didn't
call ahead.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.096
I needed to see you right away.

13:56.139 --> 14:00.709
Um, look, the P.A. is thinking
of retrying your case.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.667
But you said he wasn't.

14:02.711 --> 14:06.497
That was before they had
a lead on Tabitha's body.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.891
My source at HPD
says a tip came in

14:08.935 --> 14:12.068
and the police could be
close to finding her.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.897
That's good, isn't it? Right?
I mean, they could find evidence

14:14.941 --> 14:16.681
that clears me
once and for all, right?

14:16.725 --> 14:19.249
Possibly.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.251
Either way,
you need to be prepared.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.732
We could have to go through this
whole process all over again.

14:23.775 --> 14:27.475
Well, I am innocent and I have
the best lawyer on the island,

14:27.518 --> 14:29.129
so I'm not worried.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.827
Good. Listen,
I will let you know

14:31.871 --> 14:33.046
if I hear anything else.

14:33.089 --> 14:34.395
Thank you, Abby,
thank you.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.181
Nice to see you.Mm-hmm.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.836
Yeah.
You, too.

14:44.405 --> 14:45.972
[cell phone rings]

14:46.015 --> 14:47.582
[beeps]Did he buy it?

14:47.625 --> 14:49.540
ABBY:
Hope so.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.194
Do you really think
this will work?

14:51.238 --> 14:52.674
HIGGINS:
If he's worried enough,

14:52.717 --> 14:54.806
he'll want to check the location
where he buried Tabitha.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.547
ABBY:
Okay. Just don't lose him.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.158
Oh, we won't.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.595
Also, try not to get made.
You are driving a yellow

15:00.638 --> 15:02.075
Lamborghini, after all.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.598
MAGNUM: Yeah, that's why
I went with the SUV.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.905
Okay, it doesn't stick out
as much as the sports model,

15:05.948 --> 15:08.690
but it is still
pretty noticeable, Magnum.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.433
[engine revs]

15:28.231 --> 15:30.712
This is a good place
for a body dump.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.284
What's he doing?

15:37.327 --> 15:40.374
If he thinks HPD
is headed this way,

15:40.417 --> 15:42.245
maybe he brought a shovel
to move the body.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.945
Unless he suddenly
got an urge

15:45.988 --> 15:47.947
to do an aerial tour
of the island.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.257
Bet he's using
that drone

15:54.301 --> 15:56.085
to see if the location's
been disturbed.
Mm-hmm.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.094
Magnum,
we can't lose it.
I won't.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.532
Trust me.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.638
Turn right, turn right.I got it.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.218
Now go left, left, left, left,
left, left, left, left.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.405
We're gonna
run out of road.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.670
What're you doing?

16:59.714 --> 17:01.281
Calling for help.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.370
[cell phone rings]

17:05.807 --> 17:08.070
Hey, Higg. What's up?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.593
I'm a little
busy here.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.465
TC, I don't have time
to explain.

17:11.508 --> 17:14.250
We need you to track a drone
that is flying near Manoa Falls.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.819
Tell Thomas I'm working.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.951
Later.HIGGINS: No, no, no.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.475
TC, TC, this is
really important.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.824
It's about
a murdered girl.

17:22.867 --> 17:26.306
Please. TC?

17:26.349 --> 17:28.525
I'll be right there.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.746
Okay, folks, there's been a change of plans.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.400
I heard about
a beautiful rainbow

17:33.443 --> 17:36.098
about two miles from here.
Hang on.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.850
Okay, turn here.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.219
Where's TC?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.703
[helicopter approaching]There!

18:18.140 --> 18:19.663
TC, the drone
is nearing the falls.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.407
TC: All right,
I'm almost there.

18:24.451 --> 18:25.887
Can you see it, TC?

18:29.978 --> 18:32.067
Okay, I got eyes on.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.942
It appears to be

18:37.986 --> 18:40.075
hovering over a clearing
near the falls.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.083
Maybe that's where
he buried the body.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.303
There's only one way
to find out.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.614
I'm pretty sure this is
where it was hovering.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.400
Anybody got any Band-Aids?Band-Aids?

19:00.443 --> 19:02.141
Yeah, there's blisters
all over my feet.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.403
I wore the wrong shoes.
I wish somebody

19:03.446 --> 19:04.882
would've told me
this is what we were doing.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.493
My feet are toast.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.364
I'm about to have
a damn heatstroke.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.410
You'll live.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.935
Okay, I see a couple of spots

19:13.978 --> 19:15.763
without a lot
of tree roots and rocks.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.461
Over there...

19:18.505 --> 19:20.550
and over by
the Kali grass.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.335
Good places to bury a body.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.250
HIGGINS: Right.
We'll take one each.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.121
TC, you come with me.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.210
Let's do it.

19:31.082 --> 19:34.651
Man, did you bring
anything to eat?

19:34.695 --> 19:36.044
Ate before I came.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.959
I wish somebody
would've told me that.

19:38.002 --> 19:41.092
I really do.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.791
You think anyone's ever died
from eating a shoe?

19:45.923 --> 19:47.664
[metallic thud]

19:47.708 --> 19:49.188
Hey, Rick.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.668
Rick, listen.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.976
[metallic thuds]

19:57.021 --> 20:00.286
Yeah. Hang on.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.375
Yup, out here.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.900
That's an oil drum.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.380
Yeah, looks like it.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.425
Let's get the lid off.

20:14.082 --> 20:17.172
[both groan]

20:17.216 --> 20:19.348
[coughs]
Higgins!

20:19.392 --> 20:22.395
TC!

20:22.438 --> 20:24.397
We got a body
over here!

20:24.440 --> 20:26.442
We found a body.

20:28.357 --> 20:31.186
Oh, God.
[groans]

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
So did we.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.944
We confirmed one of the bodies
is Tabitha Hall.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.162
The other's a Jane Doe.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.991
Her prints and DNA
weren't in the system.

20:54.035 --> 20:57.952
But the M.E. determined that
she was killed five years ago.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.171
Any evidence tying
the bodies to Conlan?Nothing.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.477
Your guy was careful.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.174
We're working on tracing
the sale of the drums,

21:03.218 --> 21:04.959
but you can get them
at a lot of places.

21:05.002 --> 21:08.179
But Conlan's drone
lead us to the bodies.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.790
Surely, that's enough
to retry him.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.096
I thought you were working
with Abby on this. Now you want

21:12.140 --> 21:14.098
Conlan retried?

21:14.142 --> 21:16.971
We were just wondering
if the P.A. could use

21:17.014 --> 21:19.016
how the bodies were found
against him.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.497
Drones fly over that area
all the time,

21:21.541 --> 21:23.673
so it can be explained
away at trial.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.632
Bottom line: the prosecutor
won't retry Conlan

21:25.675 --> 21:28.069
without an airtight case,
and we still don't have one.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.079
You need to eat, Juliet.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.733
And sleep.

21:39.776 --> 21:42.126
Now that the case is reopened,
there's no need to rush it.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.345
I tried,

21:43.389 --> 21:45.129
but I couldn't
help myself.

21:45.173 --> 21:48.089
I've been up all night
looking into Conlan's past.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.960
Looking for clues
about Jane Doe's identity?

21:50.004 --> 21:51.527
Yeah.
I've been searching

21:51.571 --> 21:53.399
through his social media,
trying to find some connection

21:53.442 --> 21:58.273
to any missing women, like
university students or staff.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.276
If I can link him
to our Jane Doe's murder,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.365
I can link him to Tabitha's.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.801
Did you turn up anything?

22:04.845 --> 22:06.107
Just that Conlan went

22:06.150 --> 22:08.239
from an ordinary
English professor

22:08.283 --> 22:10.111
to a celebrated author
practically overnight

22:10.154 --> 22:12.766
with his first book,
uh, Night Song.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.203
It was so incredibly popular
that they gave him

22:15.246 --> 22:17.640
a huge advance
to write the second one,

22:17.684 --> 22:20.861
which is the novel he wrote
about Tabitha.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.558
[sighs]
Poor girls.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.170
Buried and forgotten.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.043
Not forgotten.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.264
[sighs]
Hey, Kumu.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.226
Something's wrong
with that bacon.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.183
It's vegan.

22:39.227 --> 22:42.012
Mystery solved.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.841
You look bleary-eyed.
Were you up all night as well?

22:44.885 --> 22:47.322
Yep. Up all night reading.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.281
Night Song.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.414
Cover to cover.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.025
I figured if Conlan wrote
about Tabitha in his last book,

22:55.069 --> 22:56.897
in his last book, maybe he
wrote about his first victim

22:56.940 --> 22:59.290
in his first book.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.381
Which, by the way, came out
after Jane Doe was killed.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.557
It's a dark story

23:04.600 --> 23:07.298
about this young woman who, uh,

23:07.342 --> 23:09.736
plays the clarinet and
loves the Seattle Seahawks.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.303
I wonder if any of that lines up
with any additional information

23:12.347 --> 23:14.305
HPD has about our Jane Doe.

23:14.349 --> 23:17.352
I don't know. But I'll find out.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.747
NOELANI:
Sorry, but I can't discuss

23:20.790 --> 23:22.662
what I found out about Jane Doe.

23:22.705 --> 23:26.187
Not even for a two-for-one
La Mariana drink coupon?

23:26.230 --> 23:27.580
[sighs]

23:27.623 --> 23:30.191
This is handwritten.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.975
And you misspelled "coupon."

23:32.019 --> 23:33.412
Don't worry about it.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.935
Rick knows
my writing.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.327
He'll still honor it.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.895
Mr. Magnum,
as an official employee

23:38.939 --> 23:40.462
of the medical
examiner's office,

23:40.506 --> 23:43.247
I am prohibited
from accepting gifts.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.901
He's right behind me, isn't he?

23:46.250 --> 23:48.252
Now that we
discovered the bodies

23:48.296 --> 23:50.254
and reopened the
investigation,

23:50.298 --> 23:52.343
we can't share anything
more with you.

23:52.387 --> 23:53.649
Hold on.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.999
We discovered the bodies
and told you about them.

23:56.043 --> 23:58.306
Look, we're both looking
for the truth here.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.137
Dr. Cunha, did your exam reveal

24:03.180 --> 24:04.747
anything else?

24:04.791 --> 24:07.924
Uh, not much other than
the approximate age she was

24:07.968 --> 24:10.361
when she was killed,
which was around 18.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.102
Also, there is a small

24:12.146 --> 24:14.017
Seattle Seahawks tattoo
on her right ankle.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.846
That's just like Zoey Taylor.Who?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.805
It's the main character
from Conlan's first novel.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.155
Is there a connection?There could be.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.852
I'm assuming you did
a facial reconstruction of her

24:22.896 --> 24:24.245
so we can see
what she looked like?

24:27.553 --> 24:30.164
This is based off
of craniofacial measurements,

24:30.207 --> 24:31.644
so it's not an exact image.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.863
I ran it through our databases,
but no hits.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.738
Magnum, you find out
anything else, you let me know.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.784
Don't I always?

24:45.222 --> 24:47.094
HIGGINS:
Does Katsumoto know

24:47.137 --> 24:49.531
that I'm hacking the university
where Conlan teaches?

24:49.575 --> 24:50.706
I'm sure he's counting on it.

24:50.750 --> 24:51.968
If we can match this image

24:52.012 --> 24:54.623
to one of the photos
in the student ID system,

24:54.667 --> 24:55.885
we can help
identify Jane Doe,

24:55.929 --> 24:57.365
and if she was enrolled here
five years ago,

24:57.408 --> 24:59.498
we can connect her to Conlan.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.282
So I'm searching for female
students with home addresses

25:01.325 --> 25:04.111
in the Northwest
of the United States

25:04.154 --> 25:05.286
because that's where
the main character

25:05.329 --> 25:07.114
in his first novel is from.

25:09.377 --> 25:12.380
MAGNUM:
Wendy Mills
from... Oregon.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.774
Makes sense if she was
a fan of the Seahawks.

25:14.817 --> 25:19.822
She, uh, majored in English
and minored in music.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.302
One of her professors
was Conlan.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.783
Intro to Creative Writing.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.524
It says here that
she didn't return to school

25:25.567 --> 25:27.134
after her first semester.

25:27.177 --> 25:30.006
I wonder if I google Wendy,
I can find out more about her.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.706
MAGNUM:
Memorial page.

25:33.749 --> 25:37.231
People think she's dead.

25:37.274 --> 25:40.060
She hasn't been seen
in five years.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.976
She's our Jane Doe.

25:45.456 --> 25:48.155
ABBY:
Ms. Mills,

25:48.198 --> 25:50.113
are you aware of any connection

25:50.157 --> 25:53.595
between Wendy and a professor
named Neal Conlan?

25:53.639 --> 25:56.729
I never heard of him, but...

25:56.772 --> 26:00.994
my daughter didn't share much,
even before she left home.

26:01.037 --> 26:04.127
She was always alone, writing.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.129
Journals and
short stories.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.088
Even a novel.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.090
She was very good.

26:11.134 --> 26:15.530
She left printouts
of her writing

26:15.574 --> 26:17.227
if you'd like to see then.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.489
Sure.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.451
"I walk a lonely street.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.061
"Car horns blare,
a plane flies over

26:25.105 --> 26:27.281
"and dogs...

26:27.324 --> 26:30.284
bark in t-tempo."

26:30.327 --> 26:31.720
What is it?

26:31.764 --> 26:35.724
The writing is almost identical
to the writing

26:35.768 --> 26:36.899
in Conlan's
first novel.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.858
HIGGINS:
What?

26:38.901 --> 26:40.903
Let me see.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.255
Five years ago, Conlan goes
from obscure professor

26:45.299 --> 26:47.910
to famous novelist overnight
by publishing

26:47.954 --> 26:50.130
a coming-of-age story...That he didn't write.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.566
We were wrong about his motive.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.612
It wasn't about his
relationship with these girls.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.788
If they were both
unknown authors

26:55.831 --> 26:57.311
with unpublished
novels...

26:57.354 --> 26:59.356
Conlan killed them so that
he could steal their stories

26:59.400 --> 27:01.402
and publish them as his own.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.717
HIGGINS:
The writing similarities
between Wendy and Conlan

27:11.760 --> 27:13.980
are significant.

27:14.023 --> 27:16.504
But still not enough
to convict him.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.680
All you have is a
sample of Wendy's book.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.160
Not the entire thing.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.466
And I'm sure he erased
whatever trail connected them,

27:22.510 --> 27:25.687
so all we have is conjecture,
no hard evidence.

27:25.731 --> 27:26.949
"We"?

27:26.993 --> 27:28.211
Are you saying
you want Conlan caught now?

27:28.255 --> 27:29.560
Aren't you supposed
to be defending him?

27:30.518 --> 27:32.041
ABBY:
Uh, let's just say

27:32.085 --> 27:33.477
I've had
a change of heart.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.131
Well, that's nice to hear.

27:35.175 --> 27:37.090
Unfortunately, though, you're
right. We still have no proof.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.309
But Conlan doesn't know that.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.311
What if we make him
think that, uh,

27:41.355 --> 27:44.053
Wendy's mother has information
that could implicate him?

27:44.097 --> 27:46.534
If he makes
a move on her,

27:46.577 --> 27:48.057
he'll show himself
to be the killer he is.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.755
He did act when Abby fed him

27:49.798 --> 27:51.365
that false information
about the body,

27:51.408 --> 27:53.497
and we know
he's murdered before.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.499
You're pitching we nail him
with a sting operation

27:55.543 --> 27:57.284
that uses Wendy's grieving mom
as bait,

27:57.327 --> 28:00.330
hoping he'll try
to kill her?

28:00.374 --> 28:01.723
That is your plan.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.420
We don't have to use
her actual mother.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.118
I could pretend to be her.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.511
Look, I appreciate
the offer, but...

28:07.555 --> 28:10.689
you're a little young
to be Wendy's mom.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.560
Then use me.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.171
I'm about the right age,
the right ethnicity.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.173
And I'm up to speed

28:17.217 --> 28:18.958
on all the details
of the case.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.612
How many female undercover
officers do you have

28:21.656 --> 28:23.484
who could check all those boxes?

28:23.527 --> 28:24.746
Look, I'm not using
a civilian for this.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.966
What choice do you have?

28:27.009 --> 28:30.665
Are you gonna wait for hard
evidence to magically appear?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.623
This bastard could murder again.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.930
And I met Wendy's mom.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.498
The pain of losing a child
with no justice.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.761
We need to get justice
for these girls.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.024
Let me do this.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.429
ABBY:
I'm sure you heard
about the bodies.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.039
Made national news.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.999
Yeah. I feel
awful for Tabitha

29:00.042 --> 29:02.131
and, uh, whoever
that other girl was.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.742
Have the police
identified her?

29:03.785 --> 29:06.179
They're not saying.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.096
But I got a call from a woman

29:10.139 --> 29:12.359
who claims to have information
about the case.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.578
What's weird
is that she's from Oregon.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.189
Oregon?

29:16.232 --> 29:17.581
Yeah, that is weird.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.496
She suggested she wants money.

29:19.540 --> 29:22.673
Given that you've been accused
of the crime, she...

29:22.717 --> 29:23.631
well, probably
made something up

29:23.674 --> 29:24.806
to try to make
a buck off of you.

29:24.850 --> 29:25.807
Her name is, um...

29:25.851 --> 29:27.722
Claire Mills?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.813
Doesn't ring a bell.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.467
I have
her Facebook profile photo.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.991
Let's see.

29:40.474 --> 29:43.390
Yeah, no, I don't know her.

29:43.433 --> 29:44.739
Yeah.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.611
I mean, I didn't think so.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.745
She flew in.
She wants to meet me today

29:50.789 --> 29:53.008
at noon
at the Kailua Plaza Hotel.

29:53.052 --> 29:55.228
Did she say what she had?

29:55.271 --> 29:57.621
Uh, she just said documents.
Frankly, I'm glad she came,

29:57.665 --> 30:00.059
because this way, I can
tell her in person to get lost.

30:01.103 --> 30:02.801
Please do that.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.592
Still no sign of Conlan?

30:11.635 --> 30:13.855
No, not yet.What if he knows
we're watching?

30:13.899 --> 30:16.162
There are undercover officers
all over this place.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.686
Trust me, our guys know how
to stay out of sight.

30:18.729 --> 30:19.948
There's also a chance
Conlan thinks it's too risky

30:19.992 --> 30:21.384
to go after Claire Mills.

30:21.428 --> 30:22.646
KUMU:
Maybe I should walk
through the hotel.

30:22.690 --> 30:23.952
If Conlan is scoping it out

30:23.996 --> 30:25.998
and sees me,
he might try something.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.651
Absolutely not. You stay put.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.001
We've got your room covered.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.872
I'm not putting you in
any unnecessary danger.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.831
[alarm blaring]

30:32.874 --> 30:34.963
HIGGINS:
Kumu, what's going on?

30:35.007 --> 30:36.486
It's the fire alarm.MAN [over speaker]:
Please exit

30:36.530 --> 30:37.705
the hotel immediately.

30:37.748 --> 30:39.228
Proceed
to the nearest stairwell.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.230
Do not use the elevator.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.015
This is not a drill.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.930
Kumu, go to your protection
detail in the next room.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.888
Stay with them.Okay.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.716
Garcia, Makani,
she's coming to you.

30:48.759 --> 30:52.241
[breaking up]:
Repeat. Say again. Repeat.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.373
They can't hear you.

30:53.416 --> 30:54.765
Garcia, she's coming to you!

30:54.809 --> 30:56.680
[indistinct chatter]

30:56.724 --> 30:58.117
This way, please.I-I have to...

30:58.160 --> 30:59.596
Ma'am, please,
this is not a drill.I have to be...

30:59.640 --> 31:01.120
We need to evacuate
the building.
I...

31:01.163 --> 31:02.425
Now. Let's go, ma'am.
Keep it moving.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.124
She's headed into the stairwell.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.910
Guys, get to the lobby
right now.

31:09.824 --> 31:11.826
[alarm continues blaring]

31:22.619 --> 31:24.752
I don't see her.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.449
[indistinct chatter]

31:27.711 --> 31:30.018
Higgins.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.498
They're sending
everyone this way.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.848
[overlapping shouting]

31:44.903 --> 31:46.992
It's this way.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.912
Conlan must have
pulled the fire alarm

31:53.955 --> 31:55.696
to draw her out.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.654
He's got Kumu.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.795
Get a BOLO out
on Neal Conlan.
Yes, sir.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.753
This whole area's
a blind spot.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.059
We got to check
traffic cameras,

32:11.103 --> 32:12.887
see if we can get a car
leaving the alley.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.062
I got guys pulling footage.The fact

32:14.106 --> 32:15.498
that Conlan didn't kill Kumu

32:15.542 --> 32:16.935
here at the hotel must mean

32:16.978 --> 32:19.328
that he believes
that she is Claire Mills.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.548
And he needs to keep her
alive in order to find out

32:21.591 --> 32:22.592
what she has on him.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.593
She doesn't have anything.

32:23.637 --> 32:24.899
No, I think
Higgins is right.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.814
As long as Kumu maintains
her cover

32:26.857 --> 32:28.294
and makes him
think she does,

32:28.337 --> 32:29.512
he's not gonna kill her.

32:32.907 --> 32:35.170
In case you
were wondering,

32:35.214 --> 32:38.608
that's chloroform
wearing off, Ms. Mills.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.741
As long as you
answer my questions,

32:40.784 --> 32:42.525
we won't be needing this.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.702
Now, I understand
you have

32:45.746 --> 32:48.662
some information about me
that you want to sell.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.100
Yes, I do.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.538
So what is it?

32:55.582 --> 32:57.627
[exhales]

32:57.671 --> 32:59.325
Wendy...

32:59.368 --> 33:03.111
wrote letters to me about you.

33:04.721 --> 33:07.333
What exactly did she write?

33:07.376 --> 33:11.337
She said you were interested
in the book she was writing.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.643
Then I found

33:13.687 --> 33:15.515
the outline to her novel.

33:15.558 --> 33:18.170
It's like the story
in your book.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.957
Where are the letters
and the outline?
