WEBVTT

00:01.845 --> 00:02.928
I like you, Annie.

00:03.046 --> 00:04.380
We are in this together.

00:04.548 --> 00:07.049
What about McQuaid
or your heart condition

00:07.184 --> 00:08.100
or wherever the hell you were

00:08.218 --> 00:10.219
for four months
that you didn't tell me

00:10.303 --> 00:12.221
until you needed my help
to cover it up?

00:12.389 --> 00:14.023
I'm done lying for you, Annie.

00:14.141 --> 00:15.774
It's time we talk
about your heart condition.

00:15.892 --> 00:18.861
Myocarditis is manageable
with nitrate medication.

00:18.979 --> 00:20.613
I'm resigning.
My place is in the field.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.731
Tony, how are things
at the State Department.

00:22.866 --> 00:24.450
It's not like the old days
out in the field.

00:24.568 --> 00:25.734
Pavel Mashkov.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.536
If there's an FSB connection,
we need to know.

00:27.621 --> 00:30.039
She may be the best shot we have
of getting someone inside.

00:30.157 --> 00:31.907
I need your help.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.542
Caitlyn, where's the bomb?

00:35.078 --> 00:37.046
Caitlyn Cook put a bomb on one
of the motorcade vehicles.

00:37.164 --> 00:39.915
Get these people out
of the cars and move them back.

00:43.553 --> 00:45.221
Alek.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.140
His version of events
is very different than yours.

00:48.258 --> 00:49.425
Yeah, I bet it is.

00:49.593 --> 00:51.260
He and Caitlyn
are working together.

00:51.394 --> 00:52.895
I believe you,
but he's a diplomat.

00:53.013 --> 00:54.430
He's entitled
to certain privileges.

00:54.598 --> 00:56.038
Caitlyn is no longer
available to us.

00:56.066 --> 00:57.600
All right, I need you
in Istanbul tomorrow.

00:57.684 --> 00:59.068
We missed the target yesterday,

00:59.152 --> 01:00.936
so I need to accelerate
the timetable.

01:01.071 --> 01:03.405
I have every intention
of finishing what I started.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.041 --> 01:56.792
Ryan?

01:56.910 --> 01:58.994
Did you bring one
of those for me?

01:59.129 --> 02:01.747
How did you get up so fast?

02:01.881 --> 02:04.500
The power
of positive thinking.

02:09.723 --> 02:12.091
So tell me, what are you doing
for the rest of your life?

02:15.228 --> 02:18.063
I love you, Annie Walker.

02:18.181 --> 02:21.734
Tell me you don't feel
the same.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.687
You're not gonna leave
the man hanging, are you?

02:37.867 --> 02:40.369
These sound scarier
than they really are.

02:40.503 --> 02:44.623
Tube needs adjusting,
that's all.

02:44.758 --> 02:47.042
- He hasn't woken up yet.
- It's the sedatives.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.711
It's normal.

02:51.097 --> 02:52.715
It's okay.

02:52.849 --> 02:55.768
We'll have your boyfriend out
of here in no time at all, okay?

03:10.533 --> 03:15.070
You want me to spy
on my client.

03:15.205 --> 03:19.375
I'm asking you
to serve your country.

03:19.492 --> 03:22.044
When are you seeing
Mashkov again?

03:22.128 --> 03:23.746
- I don't know.
- Would it be possible

03:23.913 --> 03:26.033
to schedule a date with him
without raising suspicion?

03:26.049 --> 03:29.418
A few weeks ago, you were
scolding me for dating Mashkov.

03:29.552 --> 03:31.003
Yeah.

03:31.137 --> 03:32.755
Now you want to know
when I'll be seeing him again?

03:32.839 --> 03:35.257
You're right.
I apologize for that.

03:35.425 --> 03:37.726
You were in a bind.
I helped out.

03:37.844 --> 03:39.595
Then I used that opportunity
to lecture you.

03:39.763 --> 03:41.680
It was wrong, and I am sorry.

03:41.765 --> 03:42.765
You're sorry?

03:42.849 --> 03:43.899
But if I was hard on you,

03:43.983 --> 03:45.934
Sydney, it was only be--

03:48.154 --> 03:49.605
Can I call you Stephanie?

03:49.773 --> 03:50.939
I know that's your real name,

03:51.074 --> 03:54.943
so it feels strange
calling you Sydney now, okay?

03:55.111 --> 03:56.445
If I was hard on you,

03:56.579 --> 04:00.666
it's only because I see a lot
of myself in you.

04:00.784 --> 04:03.035
You want people to believe
that you're an island,

04:03.169 --> 04:05.788
completely self-sufficient.

04:05.955 --> 04:08.507
But underneath, I know that
you're looking for more meaning

04:08.625 --> 04:09.842
out of your life.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.461
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:12.629 --> 04:16.515
You got all that
from screwing me?

04:18.134 --> 04:20.351
Mashkov's in town.

04:20.470 --> 04:21.970
We have a date set
for tomorrow.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.972
I thought you just sat here
and said that you didn't know--

04:24.140 --> 04:27.359
And if you want my help,
you're gonna have to pay for it.

04:27.477 --> 04:30.529
I'm a working girl.
I have my price.

04:30.647 --> 04:31.697
How much?

04:31.815 --> 04:33.615
My going rate...

04:33.733 --> 04:34.900
multiplied by ten.

04:35.034 --> 04:36.819
Why so much?

04:36.953 --> 04:38.904
Consider it...

04:38.988 --> 04:41.990
A risk premium.

04:42.158 --> 04:43.959
If I'm discovered
spying on my client,

04:44.077 --> 04:45.461
it'd be bad for business.

04:45.578 --> 04:47.212
If you're discovered
spying on Mashkov,

04:47.330 --> 04:49.047
there are a lot bigger risks
than that.

04:49.165 --> 04:49.965
You should know that going in.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.834
Are you negotiating
against yourself?

04:52.001 --> 04:53.919
'Cause we can make it 20.

04:59.259 --> 05:00.476
Hands off?

05:00.593 --> 05:01.844
- Yes.
- And that means what--

05:01.928 --> 05:03.562
No surveillance,
no counterespionage?

05:03.680 --> 05:05.013
It means hands off.

05:05.148 --> 05:06.398
Belenko's to be afforded

05:06.516 --> 05:08.066
the same rights and freedoms
as any other diplomat.

05:08.184 --> 05:09.902
But he's not
any other diplomat.

05:10.019 --> 05:12.404
Two attacks on U.S. soil
isn't enough to disprove that?

05:12.522 --> 05:14.022
I'm sympathetic
to you guys' stance,

05:14.190 --> 05:15.991
but if I'm gonna change minds
at state,

05:16.075 --> 05:18.827
I need something
that definitively ties Belenko

05:18.912 --> 05:20.362
himself to the attacks,

05:20.530 --> 05:22.030
because State doesn't see a
terrorist when they look at him.

05:22.198 --> 05:24.583
They see a friend.
Belenko was having an affair

05:24.701 --> 05:26.034
with Caitlyn Cook.
Who he shot.

05:26.169 --> 05:28.537
Who he shot because he
was afraid she was gonna talk.

05:28.705 --> 05:29.922
Well, that's not
what Belenko says.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.840
Belenko says
he was protecting Annie Walker.

05:31.958 --> 05:33.041
Tony, he's lying.

05:33.126 --> 05:35.544
Says the operative who
is suspended from field duty.

05:35.678 --> 05:37.880
How reliable is she?

05:38.014 --> 05:39.548
If it weren't
for that operative,

05:39.716 --> 05:43.352
you wouldn't sitting here
giving me this news.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.103
Listen...

05:45.221 --> 05:47.890
I am well aware of how close
I was to being dead.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.227
You don't think I'm as pissed
off about this as you?

05:52.395 --> 05:53.875
No, Tony, I don't,
'cause if you were,

05:53.897 --> 05:54.897
you'd be helping us
nail Belenko

05:55.064 --> 05:56.424
instead of providing cover
for him.

05:56.483 --> 05:59.067
I'm just
the messenger, Auggie.

05:59.202 --> 06:00.402
I don't set policy.

06:00.487 --> 06:03.956
Spoken like a true bureaucrat.
Congratulations, Tony.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.908
You're gonna do well
in the diplomatic corps.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.496
How's he doing?

06:16.803 --> 06:19.388
How about we get
some fresh air?

06:19.472 --> 06:20.806
So this is Caitlyn's?

06:20.924 --> 06:22.424
It's her private calendar.
It's coded.

06:22.559 --> 06:24.092
And there's no way
to definitively corroborate

06:24.227 --> 06:25.310
any of these meetings.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.895
But?

06:27.013 --> 06:29.848
But she had a meet scheduled
in Istanbul tomorrow

06:29.983 --> 06:31.400
with a contact code-named Q.

06:31.518 --> 06:33.652
- Q. Who's Q?
- I don't know.

06:33.770 --> 06:36.071
Like I said,
it's--it's not much.

06:36.189 --> 06:38.273
But it's something.

06:38.408 --> 06:41.026
I want to go. Maybe it'll lead
us back to Belenko.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.579
I want to get the guy who was
behind the Chicago attack,

06:43.696 --> 06:45.030
and I want to get the guy
who put McQuaid

06:45.164 --> 06:45.831
in that hospital bed.

06:45.949 --> 06:47.749
I'm not against you going,

06:47.867 --> 06:49.187
but if you're looking
for revenge,

06:49.252 --> 06:50.335
you're gonna have to find
somebody else

06:50.453 --> 06:51.453
to pay your freight.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.538
I don't want revenge.

06:52.672 --> 06:53.912
I just want to prove
to everyone

06:53.957 --> 06:57.926
that Belenko is not who he says
he is and bring him in.

06:58.044 --> 07:00.963
How soon can you get
on a plane?

07:01.097 --> 07:03.682
Excuse me, Susan?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.240
If it's--if it's not
too much to ask,

07:05.268 --> 07:07.803
would you mind contacting me
with any updates?

07:07.937 --> 07:09.304
I'm not allowed
to contact anyone

07:09.439 --> 07:10.806
but family members directly.

07:10.974 --> 07:13.809
Please?

07:13.943 --> 07:17.479
I just want to know
that he's all right.

07:17.564 --> 07:18.864
Okay.

07:21.317 --> 07:22.901
I have to leave.

07:23.036 --> 07:24.069
I'm sorry.

07:24.203 --> 07:27.823
I wanted to be here
when you woke up.

07:27.991 --> 07:30.909
So here's the deal.

07:31.044 --> 07:32.878
You get back on your feet,

07:32.996 --> 07:36.715
and I'll go get the guy
behind all this.

07:40.003 --> 07:41.887
Okay?

07:54.335 --> 07:58.335

08:20.175 --> 08:22.677
The meet was supposed
to go down 15 minutes ago.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.211
Hang in there.
They'll show.

08:24.345 --> 08:25.963
- How's McQuaid doing?
- No change.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.348
He's still stable but critical.

08:28.466 --> 08:32.635
I'll get over there later
to check on him.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.188
Hold on a sec.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.063
I'm sending you a photo.
Tell me when you get it.

08:44.198 --> 08:48.318
See if you can run it through
the database and get an I.D.

08:48.453 --> 08:49.893
I don't need
to run anything through.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.455
His name's Krasny, ex-FSB.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.625
He's been on my radar
since before I was DCS.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.294
Hold on.
He's got company.

09:03.301 --> 09:06.837
I'm sending you a second one.
Hold on.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.892
All right,
the guy sitting with Krasny--

09:12.010 --> 09:15.228
his name is Mahmoud Qabbani,
a Syrian arms dealer.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.396
That's Caitlyn's Q.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.482
He's been off the radar
since a Hezbollah attack

09:18.599 --> 09:20.350
in Tel Aviv six weeks ago.

09:20.485 --> 09:22.185
From what I'm hearing
from my sources,

09:22.320 --> 09:23.654
Mossad wants him dead.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.571
- Let's talk money.
- We said $12 million, no?

09:25.606 --> 09:26.857
We did.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.327
But things have changed,
and price is now $20 million.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.195
That's not what was discussed.

09:32.331 --> 09:36.084
Neither was you showing up
instead of Caitlyn Cook.

09:36.167 --> 09:39.286
You have three hours to find it
before I leave town.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.839
If we have a deal,
you know how to reach me.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.592
The car's pulling away.

09:45.677 --> 09:47.294
I can't tail it.
Just stay with Qabbani.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.702
If Krasny's working
for Belenko,

09:48.796 --> 09:50.396
we can prove
he's not just some diplomat.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.715
I need to know
what's in those bags.

09:51.849 --> 09:53.266
Stay with Qabbani.
He'll lead you back there.

09:53.351 --> 09:54.968
All right, I sent you partial
of the license plate.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.270
See what you can find.

10:02.694 --> 10:04.861
- Auggie.
- Joan.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.196
I talked to Tony.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.864
He says we can't touch Belenko.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.282
I can't believe
I served with that guy.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.760
He used to be one
of the good ones.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.869
Well, all these turf battles
are par for the course.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.204
We always find the workaround.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.956
In the meantime,
Annie's in the position

10:16.074 --> 10:18.492
to press forward on her own.
What do you mean?

10:18.659 --> 10:20.243
She's in Istanbul
running down a lead.

10:20.378 --> 10:23.046
She didn't tell you?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.247
No.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.884
Well, anyway,
this could lead to Belenko.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.169
What's this?

10:29.337 --> 10:32.305
Arthur sent it over, said he
could use a fresh pair of eyes--

10:32.390 --> 10:34.641
take a look at it, so to speak.

10:34.726 --> 10:36.059
Joan?

10:36.177 --> 10:39.429
The DCS would like
to see you in his office.

10:39.515 --> 10:42.483
Sydney agreed to help
with Mashkov?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.268
She did. She has a date
with him a few hours from now.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.593
Well,
we better move fast, then.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.855
This guy was already
rousted once for solicitation,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.907
so I say we grab him up,
put the screws to him.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.409
He's got a wife and a career.
He'll roll.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.247
He won't even know
that Sydney was involved.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.495
What if he doesn't roll?

10:55.613 --> 10:57.293
Then we move to the next guy
down the list.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.082
We may not get
a second chance.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.400
Someone at the Russian embassy

11:00.535 --> 11:02.035
knew about Belenko
before we did.

11:02.171 --> 11:04.338
If we can access
Mashkov's files,

11:04.455 --> 11:08.258
we could find a concrete link
tying Belenko to Chicago.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.679
You want Sydney
to work Mashkov?

11:11.763 --> 11:14.514
That is a much higher tightrope
for her to walk.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.350
You sure she's up for it?
I don't know...

11:17.435 --> 11:20.687
But she's our best shot.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.056
You want me to run her?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.692
- I got this.
- Okay.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.566
- Yeah?
- Any luck?

11:32.733 --> 11:35.035
No, we tried
to match the partial,

11:35.153 --> 11:39.239
but our street-level camera
access is--it's patchy at best.

11:39.373 --> 11:40.707
I don't know
if this is kosher or not,

11:40.792 --> 11:42.409
but what about looping Joan in?

11:42.543 --> 11:43.794
Maybe Auggie can help us out?

11:43.911 --> 11:46.413
I already looped her in,
and this update was from Auggie.

11:46.547 --> 11:49.382
You're gonna have to figure
something else out.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.279
Do not move.

12:29.590 --> 12:31.341
Put your hands
on the end of the table

12:31.459 --> 12:33.426
and leave them there.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.428
You should have taken
the $12 million.

12:35.546 --> 12:40.383
Now you're gonna take a bit
of a discount.

12:40.518 --> 12:41.635
Call your driver.

12:41.769 --> 12:43.770
Tell him to come pick you up
with the goods in the trunk.

12:43.855 --> 12:45.895
And before you try and give him
any coded warning...

13:00.488 --> 13:02.489
Get dressed.

13:02.623 --> 13:03.874
I am a businessman.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.825
I hope you understand that.
Meaning?

13:05.993 --> 13:07.494
Meaning we can make a deal.

13:07.628 --> 13:09.162
You want to know
who the buyer is?

13:09.297 --> 13:10.580
Aleksandre Belenko.

13:10.715 --> 13:13.500
But you don't know
what he's buying, do you?

13:13.668 --> 13:15.752
What is it?

13:15.887 --> 13:17.587
No, don't!

13:21.008 --> 13:23.894
Come on,
let's get out of here.

13:32.486 --> 13:34.187
Let's go.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.191
The car--
I have to find the car.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.444
Come on,
there's no time.

13:46.453 --> 13:48.460
I needed that guy alive.

13:48.731 --> 13:49.847
You didn't think
to hold your fire

13:49.932 --> 13:51.149
when you saw me
standing there?

13:51.267 --> 13:52.387
I had too tight of a window.

13:52.434 --> 13:54.602
I'm sorry,
but Qabbani had to pay.

13:54.737 --> 13:56.521
For the attacks
in Tel Aviv last month?

13:56.655 --> 13:59.691
Qabbani supplied them
with the bomb material.

14:01.026 --> 14:03.661
- What?
- You know what this is.

14:03.746 --> 14:05.446
Come on,
how else can you explain it?

14:05.581 --> 14:08.166
You're looking for the exact
same guy, the exact same place,

14:08.284 --> 14:10.868
the exact same time as me?

14:11.036 --> 14:12.503
It's kismet,<i> neshama.</i>

14:12.621 --> 14:14.539
Qabbani was gonna
serve me Belenko on a plate,

14:14.673 --> 14:15.673
and you killed him.

14:15.758 --> 14:17.458
Aleksandre Belenko,
the diplomat?

14:17.593 --> 14:18.960
What's he got
to do with anything?

14:19.094 --> 14:20.845
I can't say.

14:20.963 --> 14:23.848
What are we gonna do now?

14:23.966 --> 14:26.551
Come on, we have to go.

14:43.402 --> 14:45.653
Istanbul isn't safe anymore.
We need to jump on board.

14:45.788 --> 14:49.207
No, no, I'm not leaving.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.993
Belenko was gonna buy something
from Qabbani.

14:52.127 --> 14:54.495
You don't know what it was,
do you?

14:54.630 --> 14:55.413
No.

14:55.581 --> 14:59.417
Well, I have to stay
until I find out.

14:59.585 --> 15:03.004
Well, he's making big moves
for a diplomat, isn't he?

15:03.138 --> 15:04.555
Think he's working on his own

15:04.673 --> 15:06.391
or for some kind of front
for the FSB?

15:06.508 --> 15:07.925
I'm not sure yet.
Why?

15:08.060 --> 15:10.928
Just trying to figure out how
deep a hole I'm jumping into.

15:18.771 --> 15:20.154
So...

15:20.272 --> 15:22.857
What now,<i> neshama?</i>

15:26.362 --> 15:27.695
You find the car?

15:27.830 --> 15:29.364
Just more cops.

15:29.498 --> 15:31.366
You really thought the car
would be back there, did you?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.750
I had to be sure.

15:32.868 --> 15:34.369
What else do you know
about Qabbani?

15:34.503 --> 15:35.920
I mean, how'd you even know
he was in Istanbul?

15:36.038 --> 15:37.121
Our source told us

15:37.256 --> 15:38.456
he was gonna be coming here
to make a sale.

15:38.624 --> 15:40.124
We've been surveilling him
since yesterday.

15:40.259 --> 15:41.676
The hammam was
the best option available.

15:41.794 --> 15:43.074
Do you know
where he was staying?

15:43.128 --> 15:44.262
Maybe the car's there.

15:44.380 --> 15:45.430
You know,
I got to tell you,<i>neshama,</i>

15:45.547 --> 15:46.597
I'm a little surprised
with all these questions.

15:46.682 --> 15:48.516
Usually Langley
sends you better prepared.

15:48.634 --> 15:51.636
I'm not working
for Langley anymore.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.355
What?

15:54.473 --> 15:56.607
They found out about my heart.

15:56.725 --> 15:58.476
How?

15:58.644 --> 15:59.944
It's not important.

16:00.062 --> 16:01.529
They wanted me behind a desk,
and that's not what I wanted,

16:01.647 --> 16:04.148
so I walked away.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.150
Why do I think
it's more complicated than that?

16:06.318 --> 16:08.953
It is, and it isn't.

16:09.037 --> 16:10.822
All right, so,
if you don't work for Langley,

16:10.906 --> 16:12.156
what are you doing here?

16:12.291 --> 16:16.160
Do you know
where Qabbani was staying?

16:16.295 --> 16:18.830
It's not far from here.

16:18.965 --> 16:21.500
What we're gonna do
is hot-sync Mashkov's phone.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.668
- "Hot-sync"?
- When you have the chance,

16:23.836 --> 16:26.504
you take this phone, press it
against his for 30 seconds,

16:26.638 --> 16:28.723
technology will do the rest.

16:28.841 --> 16:30.007
Do I have to hit a button

16:30.175 --> 16:32.677
or hold it
in any special kind of way?

16:32.811 --> 16:35.229
No, just get them together.

16:35.347 --> 16:37.348
Okay.

16:37.433 --> 16:40.518
Hey...

16:40.602 --> 16:43.438
There's nothing
to worry about, okay?

16:43.573 --> 16:45.774
Mashkov has no reason
to suspect you,

16:45.858 --> 16:47.575
and I'm going to be able
to listen in.

16:47.693 --> 16:50.411
And if you're in any distress,
you say the word.

16:50.529 --> 16:52.497
I'll send in backup.

16:52.614 --> 16:53.614
We have backup?

16:53.749 --> 16:56.501
Conor, say hi to Sydney.

17:03.258 --> 17:05.009
I wouldn't have asked you
to do this

17:05.093 --> 17:08.628
if I wasn't certain that
you could handle yourself, okay?

17:08.714 --> 17:13.518
If you feel like you can't make
the sync, that's fine, okay?

17:13.635 --> 17:15.720
We'll wait
for another opportunity.

17:15.854 --> 17:19.941
I trust you to make
the right call.

17:20.058 --> 17:23.144
Press mine against his
for 30 seconds, and it's done?

17:23.278 --> 17:24.945
Yes.

17:25.063 --> 17:27.365
Just like every other trick.

17:29.868 --> 17:31.736
Okay.

17:33.655 --> 17:34.739
Hey...

17:37.876 --> 17:39.911
Yeah.

17:48.554 --> 17:49.587
Yeah?

17:49.755 --> 17:52.006
Hey, Auggie, it's me, Tony.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.425
You really think Belenko's
the guy behind Chicago,

17:54.593 --> 17:55.510
the guy who killed Charlie?

17:55.594 --> 17:57.812
Come on, Tony,
you know I do.

17:57.930 --> 18:00.481
It was on me, you know.

18:00.599 --> 18:01.766
What was?

18:01.934 --> 18:04.268
That car where the bomb
was planted--that was my detail.

18:04.436 --> 18:07.438
I-I should have--I should have
double-checked everything.

18:11.159 --> 18:13.661
Tony, it happens.
We all make mistakes.

18:13.779 --> 18:15.530
Yeah.

18:15.614 --> 18:17.949
Well, I'm trying
not to make too many more.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.451
I know my boss won't be happy
about me sharing this,

18:20.586 --> 18:22.286
but something
came across my desk

18:22.421 --> 18:23.621
regarding Belenko's itinerary,

18:23.622 --> 18:26.123
and I thought
it might interest you.

18:29.378 --> 18:31.178
This is where Qabbani
was staying.

18:31.296 --> 18:32.713
There's the car.

18:51.817 --> 18:53.484
Annie.

18:56.038 --> 18:59.407
There were three duffel bags
in the car.

18:59.541 --> 19:01.325
Maybe they took them inside.

20:27.462 --> 20:28.879
Eyal!

20:58.910 --> 21:00.444
Stop!

21:08.620 --> 21:11.172
No!

21:28.640 --> 21:29.690
You okay?

21:29.808 --> 21:33.394
Yeah.
I'm fine.

21:33.528 --> 21:34.862
Did you see those duffel bags
in the house?

21:34.980 --> 21:38.315
Oh, you mean before whoever it
was hit me in the face?

21:38.450 --> 21:39.700
No.

21:39.818 --> 21:41.485
Did you recognize her?

21:42.654 --> 21:45.489
No.
Hello?

21:45.657 --> 21:48.492
Annie, hi. This is Susan
from G.M. Hospital.

21:48.627 --> 21:51.045
Yeah, I'm afraid
there's been some complications.

21:59.371 --> 22:00.955
Can you tell me anything else?

22:01.072 --> 22:02.072
No, I understand.

22:02.542 --> 22:04.677
Thank you again for calling.

22:26.283 --> 22:28.234
You know, we don't have
to talk about it

22:28.368 --> 22:30.236
if you don't want to.

22:30.370 --> 22:33.405
A colleague of mine
was rushed into surgery,

22:33.540 --> 22:35.741
something
about a pulmonary embolism,

22:35.876 --> 22:39.128
complications
from a gunshot wound.

22:39.246 --> 22:41.964
A colleague?

22:42.082 --> 22:43.082
A friend.

22:43.216 --> 22:45.251
Belenko was behind it all.

22:45.385 --> 22:47.052
You wanted to know
what I'm doing here?

22:47.170 --> 22:49.755
That's what I'm doing here.

22:58.398 --> 22:59.598
Uh, Auggie?

22:59.733 --> 23:01.350
Hey, Annie.

23:01.434 --> 23:03.769
Uh, I wasn't expecting
to hear from you.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.021
Yeah, I know, but I heard
you were in Istanbul,

23:06.156 --> 23:08.240
and I just got a line
on Belenko's whereabouts.

23:08.358 --> 23:09.358
He's here?

23:09.409 --> 23:11.160
He arrived
about half an hour ago

23:11.278 --> 23:14.246
to attend an energy summit
at the Pera Palace hotel,

23:14.364 --> 23:15.497
last-minute change of plans.

23:15.615 --> 23:16.665
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

23:16.783 --> 23:18.284
Also, I don't know
if you've heard,

23:18.368 --> 23:20.169
but Arthur just told me
that McQuaid--

23:20.287 --> 23:23.455
Rushed into surgery, I know.

23:23.623 --> 23:26.125
They're some of
the best surgeons in the world.

23:26.259 --> 23:27.626
I know.

23:29.296 --> 23:30.296
Listen, Auggie...

23:30.463 --> 23:32.014
I should get back
to my office.

23:32.132 --> 23:34.383
You take care out there.

23:50.533 --> 23:54.320
You're worth double,
at least.

23:56.539 --> 23:58.908
I love watching you do this.

23:58.992 --> 24:01.076
Go on, take a shower.

24:01.161 --> 24:03.241
You don't want your wife
wondering where you've been.

24:03.296 --> 24:04.997
You're in a rush
to get rid of me.

24:05.131 --> 24:06.832
Oh, never.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.717
I have a midterm
to study for tomorrow.

24:08.835 --> 24:11.053
Slower, slower.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.364
Sydney...

24:43.286 --> 24:45.371
You must think I'm an idiot.

24:45.505 --> 24:47.006
Excuse me?

24:54.297 --> 24:58.350
I didn't want you
to think I forgot.

24:58.468 --> 25:00.219
Save Tuesday for me.

25:00.303 --> 25:01.971
There's a party
I want to take you to.

25:02.105 --> 25:03.472
Mm.

25:03.606 --> 25:05.524
Cancel everything
that you have.

25:05.642 --> 25:08.560
I'll check my calendar.

25:22.542 --> 25:24.209
You got it?

25:26.746 --> 25:28.797
No problem.

25:37.257 --> 25:39.224
It doesn't make any sense.

25:39.342 --> 25:41.643
Belenko has been so careful
thus far.

25:41.761 --> 25:43.846
His fingerprints
are nowhere near anything,

25:43.980 --> 25:47.266
and now when his buy goes
pear-shaped, he shows up here?

25:47.434 --> 25:49.318
You think he'll tip his hand
to what his next target is?

25:49.436 --> 25:51.603
Honestly?

25:51.771 --> 25:53.238
No.

25:53.356 --> 25:55.157
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

25:55.275 --> 25:59.411
What were you going to do--
sit vigil by his bedside?

25:59.529 --> 26:01.080
You're not wired that way.

26:01.197 --> 26:03.665
Instead I'm sitting in a car
in Istanbul going nowhere.

26:03.783 --> 26:06.452
This is
how you show you care.

26:06.619 --> 26:10.039
Actions trump words
every time in my book.

26:19.799 --> 26:21.100
- Miss Annie Walker?
- Yes?

26:21.184 --> 26:24.269
Mr. Belenko would like
your company, please.

26:24.354 --> 26:25.471
Okay.

26:31.311 --> 26:34.146
Oh, uh...

26:34.280 --> 26:35.814
Come on, Annie,
don't do this.

26:35.899 --> 26:38.299
If he wants to play a game of
cat and mouse, fine, I'll play.

26:38.318 --> 26:39.701
Which one are you
in that scenario?

26:39.819 --> 26:41.820
It's daylight
in a crowded room.

26:41.988 --> 26:43.622
Annie...

26:43.740 --> 26:46.325
If he was gonna kill me,
he wouldn't send the concierge.

26:46.459 --> 26:48.377
I'll be fine.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.644
It's just a precaution.

27:05.762 --> 27:07.229
You can't be too safe.

27:32.372 --> 27:35.007
What, no hug?

27:41.071 --> 27:43.373
There is an old
Chinese proverb.

27:44.007 --> 27:48.394
It says that when someone,
in this example, me,

27:48.528 --> 27:52.698
saves another person's life--
that would be you...

27:52.816 --> 27:55.700
He is responsible for her
from that day forward.

27:55.771 --> 27:57.639
So...

27:57.773 --> 28:02.060
I guess your life
is in my hands now.

28:02.194 --> 28:05.897
I've been reading up
about you, you know.

28:06.031 --> 28:08.449
You were suspended
from the CIA recently--

28:08.567 --> 28:10.785
something
about a heart condition.

28:10.903 --> 28:12.453
And after everything
you've done for your country.

28:12.538 --> 28:15.540
It must raise your ire.

28:15.658 --> 28:18.660
A word of advice--
don't hold on to it.

28:18.794 --> 28:23.381
The venom can poison your body.

28:23.499 --> 28:25.833
Did Caitlyn give you my file?

28:25.968 --> 28:28.419
- Caitlyn?
- The woman you shot.

28:28.554 --> 28:31.339
Now, why would she
have given me anything?

28:31.473 --> 28:33.591
I barely know her.

28:33.726 --> 28:36.761
No, I have friends
with the FSB,

28:36.895 --> 28:39.013
and they find
you very fascinating.

28:39.148 --> 28:42.016
- I've been reading on you too.
- I'm flattered.

28:42.151 --> 28:43.518
You know what I found?

28:43.619 --> 28:45.253
Nothing.

28:47.523 --> 28:49.407
The world thinks
you're a paragon of virtue.

28:51.777 --> 28:55.246
I wouldn't go that far.
Every man has a vice or two.

28:55.364 --> 28:57.448
I know you were responsible
for the attacks

28:57.583 --> 29:00.702
in Chicago and D.C.,

29:00.836 --> 29:02.453
and I know the reason
you're here

29:02.588 --> 29:03.908
is because the buy
you were making

29:04.006 --> 29:05.757
from Mahmoud Qabbani
went south.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.425
You do have
an active imagination.

29:07.543 --> 29:09.627
And I know about
your relationship with Caitlyn.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.068
Is that supposed
to mean something to me?

29:34.153 --> 29:37.455
It's the wedding ring
you gave her.

29:37.573 --> 29:40.458
That's what she said...

29:40.576 --> 29:43.578
with her dying breath.

29:56.475 --> 29:58.643
This tete-a-tete
has been very enlightening.

29:58.761 --> 30:00.595
We should do it again sometime.

30:00.679 --> 30:01.919
I hope you don't think me rude,

30:01.930 --> 30:03.514
but I need to make sure
you won't follow me.

30:03.649 --> 30:04.682
Why would I follow you?

30:04.817 --> 30:07.351
You're a hotheaded
ex-CIA operative

30:07.486 --> 30:10.521
who's got some sort
of strange fixation for me.

30:10.656 --> 30:12.440
Who knows
what you're capable of?

30:12.574 --> 30:15.777
What's in the duffels?

30:15.944 --> 30:17.779
Diplomatic pouches.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.448
Be sure to wish your boyfriend
a speedy recovery for me,

30:20.582 --> 30:22.867
won't you?

31:02.074 --> 31:04.458
The bags are in the S.U.V.

32:58.908 --> 33:00.942
Bags?

33:11.538 --> 33:13.990
I saw them put those bags
in the S.U.V.

33:14.124 --> 33:17.827
I don't know when they
could have switched them out.

33:17.911 --> 33:20.913
And at the hotel, I saw a tremor
in Belenko's hand.

33:21.048 --> 33:23.549
What do you think
that could indicate?

33:23.667 --> 33:25.227
Without an exam,
it's difficult to say--

33:25.252 --> 33:27.420
maybe some kind
of neurological failure.

33:27.554 --> 33:29.255
There was nothing
in his medical records?

33:29.390 --> 33:30.840
No.

33:33.427 --> 33:37.180
I won't, uh, do you the dishonor
of saying I owe you one.

33:37.314 --> 33:38.481
Thank you.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.266
I probably owe you two
or three by now.

33:40.401 --> 33:43.186
Well, it's actually five,
but who's counting?

33:45.189 --> 33:47.440
You know, I do, uh--
I do look forward

33:47.574 --> 33:51.244
to these encounters of ours,
no matter how brief.

33:51.328 --> 33:55.248
People in our profession
need something to look forward--

33:55.366 --> 33:57.583
you know what?
Um...

33:57.701 --> 33:59.869
Listen, I misspoke earlier.

34:01.755 --> 34:03.373
Actions speak
louder than words,

34:03.457 --> 34:05.375
but words are important

34:05.459 --> 34:07.627
so that the other person
knows how you feel.

34:09.513 --> 34:11.297
For example, I was talking
to Ronit the other day.

34:11.431 --> 34:12.882
- Ronit?
- Yes.

34:12.966 --> 34:14.967
My--my ex-wife.
Your ex-wife?

34:15.101 --> 34:16.886
I thought you weren't speaking.

34:17.020 --> 34:20.139
Well, we weren't,
but now we're back together.

34:20.274 --> 34:23.059
Apparently she's been
wanting to reconcile for years,

34:23.193 --> 34:25.978
wondering why I never
picked up on the clues.

34:26.112 --> 34:28.815
Finally, she said something.

34:28.982 --> 34:31.650
So we decided to give
it another try.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.034
The point is...

34:33.152 --> 34:36.371
If you feel something
for this guy,

34:36.489 --> 34:38.157
then go home and tell him.

34:43.547 --> 34:44.831
Thanks.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.255
I'm happy for you,<i> neshama.</i>

35:21.335 --> 35:24.537
So I guess
we'll be in touch soon.

35:24.671 --> 35:26.372
Yeah.

35:31.178 --> 35:33.846
The amount we agreed upon.

35:33.964 --> 35:35.131
You earned it.

35:40.387 --> 35:44.223
The Intel on his phone...

35:44.358 --> 35:47.226
Was it valuable?

35:47.311 --> 35:49.312
I believe so.

35:49.446 --> 35:52.231
Then am I still valuable...

35:52.366 --> 35:54.233
to you?

35:54.319 --> 35:58.205
I mean, will you need me
to keep dating Mashkov?

36:00.123 --> 36:02.375
That would be helpful, yes.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.378
But listen to me--if you're
having any second thoughts

36:05.462 --> 36:07.380
or you want to interact
with someone else at the Agency,

36:07.498 --> 36:08.631
you just say the word.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.583
If I'm gonna keep
doing this,

36:10.751 --> 36:13.669
I don't want to do it
for the money.

36:13.804 --> 36:17.139
This I want to keep separate.

36:24.481 --> 36:27.266
You'll still be
in charge of me, right?

36:27.434 --> 36:30.019
If that's what you want,
Sydney, of course.

36:30.153 --> 36:33.239
I'd like you
to call me Stephanie.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.357
Okay, Stephanie.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.281
Incoming call-Tony.

36:42.449 --> 36:46.252
Incoming call--Tony.
Yeah?

36:46.370 --> 36:49.355
Hey, Auggie,
I got a joke to tell you.

36:49.489 --> 36:52.124
What's the difference
between a diplomat and a lady?

36:52.292 --> 36:53.843
Tony, it's 5:30
in the morning.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.261
What are you doing?

36:55.345 --> 36:57.680
If a diplomat says no,
he's no longer a diplomat.

36:57.798 --> 37:01.133
But if a lady says no, she--

37:01.301 --> 37:04.604
ah, I got that backwards.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.358
I'm a little bit drunk.
You don't say?

37:09.476 --> 37:11.811
It's my first drink
in 38 months.

37:11.945 --> 37:13.145
Thank you very much.

37:13.313 --> 37:17.316
I got the--

37:17.451 --> 37:19.035
I got the chip right here
to prove it.

37:19.152 --> 37:21.320
Listen, man, shouldn't you
be calling your sponsor?

37:21.488 --> 37:23.155
No, I...

37:26.410 --> 37:28.160
I want--

37:28.295 --> 37:30.830
I wanted to speak to you.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.167
I-I got fired today.

37:35.335 --> 37:36.802
Wait. What?
Why?

37:36.887 --> 37:38.638
Belenko complained to someone

37:38.722 --> 37:43.009
that he got harassed on the way
out of Istanbul...

37:43.143 --> 37:44.677
by your friend.

37:44.811 --> 37:46.395
- Annie?
- Yeah.

37:46.513 --> 37:49.181
And the undersecretary demanded
somebody's head on a spike,

37:49.349 --> 37:50.650
so, um...

37:50.767 --> 37:52.485
Well, I confessed,

37:52.603 --> 37:54.487
you know, to leaking
the travel schedule,

37:54.571 --> 37:58.658
because who better than the guy
who actually did it?

37:58.775 --> 38:01.160
Tony, I'm so sorry.

38:01.278 --> 38:03.913
I feel guilty about this.
So do I, man.

38:06.533 --> 38:09.619
I've been having dreams,
Auggie...

38:11.838 --> 38:13.172
Bad ones.

38:13.290 --> 38:15.207
It ever haunt you--
things we did back there?

38:15.342 --> 38:16.592
What things, buddy?

38:16.710 --> 38:18.794
Back there, man...

38:18.929 --> 38:21.797
When we were in the service.

38:21.882 --> 38:25.217
You know what?
I'm coming over.

38:25.352 --> 38:27.386
Just promise me you're
not gonna have another drink

38:27.471 --> 38:28.804
until I get there, okay?

38:28.939 --> 38:30.306
I don't need
a babysitter, Auggie.

38:30.390 --> 38:31.857
Tony.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.026
Okay.

38:34.144 --> 38:35.194
Okay, I-I promise.

38:35.312 --> 38:37.196
All right,
I'll see you in a minute.

38:46.323 --> 38:47.657
Susan...

38:47.791 --> 38:49.458
How is he?
Is he out of surgery?

38:49.576 --> 38:51.043
Is he conscious?
Is he okay?

38:51.161 --> 38:53.442
He just woke up a couple of
hours ago from the anesthesia.

38:53.463 --> 38:56.499
You can ask him yourself.
He's up?

38:56.633 --> 38:59.251
Hey.

39:02.756 --> 39:04.640
Hi.

39:07.310 --> 39:09.228
You gave us a scare.

39:09.346 --> 39:12.565
I'm just trying
to keep everyone on their toes.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.433
Sorry I wasn't here
when you woke up.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.236
No, don't be.
I'm...

39:17.354 --> 39:20.439
I'm okay with it.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.491
We made a deal the other day.

39:22.609 --> 39:25.861
I-I don't know
if you heard or not.

39:25.996 --> 39:28.247
But I didn't keep up my end.

39:28.365 --> 39:31.333
I didn't catch the bad guy...

39:31.451 --> 39:33.285
Not yet, at least.

39:33.370 --> 39:35.204
Did I keep up my end?

39:38.375 --> 39:40.676
You're okay, so...

39:40.794 --> 39:44.213
Yeah.

39:44.347 --> 39:45.848
You must be exhausted.

39:45.966 --> 39:48.884
I want to talk, really.
I-I just...

39:50.637 --> 39:52.805
It's okay.
There's plenty of time.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.894
Sleep.

39:59.029 --> 40:00.896
I'll be here.

40:21.802 --> 40:23.052
Paging Dr. Stateman.

40:23.170 --> 40:25.004
Dr. Stateman, please--
this is bullshit.

40:25.172 --> 40:27.339
I keep telling you
it wasn't alcohol poisoning.

40:27.507 --> 40:29.391
You know what? Let me talk
to the guy who made that call.

40:29.509 --> 40:30.676
- Sir--
- No, look...

40:30.844 --> 40:32.845
If you can't help me,
find me someone who can.

40:33.013 --> 40:35.097
I want to see
the toxicology report.

40:35.232 --> 40:36.732
Auggie.

40:36.850 --> 40:37.900
Annie,
what are you doing here?

40:38.018 --> 40:39.185
McQuaid is recovering
from the gunshot wound.

40:39.269 --> 40:42.071
What's going on?

40:42.189 --> 40:43.856
Tony died.

40:45.992 --> 40:47.243
- Tony Salgado?
- Yeah.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.694
What--what happened?

40:48.829 --> 40:51.247
They're telling me
he drank himself to death.

40:51.364 --> 40:53.949
I don't believe it.

40:54.084 --> 40:56.035
- It's a big shock. You need--
- No, no.

40:56.119 --> 40:59.455
I don't believe
that's what killed him.

40:59.589 --> 41:01.040
The M.E.
will see you now, sir.

41:01.174 --> 41:02.174
Right this way.

41:02.209 --> 41:03.342
- Annie, I got to go.
- Okay.

41:03.426 --> 41:05.211
Man, I can't see you.
You got to take me.

41:05.345 --> 41:07.053
You've got
to give him your arm.
