17:20.200 --> 17:22.050
Cheese!

17:28.000 --> 17:29.233
Oh, why thank you,
dear.

17:29.266 --> 17:31.333
I think I will
take your hat.

17:31.366 --> 17:34.050
Katka, phase one
complete.

17:34.083 --> 17:35.383
What are sensor
readings?

17:35.416 --> 17:38.083
Oh, Dexter, computer shows

17:38.116 --> 17:41.166
processed photos vault
on ninth floor.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.283
Roger that.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.000
They're not here!

18:56.166 --> 18:57.350
Then where
could they be?

18:57.383 --> 18:59.133
[Door opens]

19:01.083 --> 19:03.150
Who are you?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.316
Um...cindy?

19:04.350 --> 19:07.083
Oh. Oh, yes.
Right, right, right.

19:07.116 --> 19:10.183
I almost didn't
recognize you.

19:12.283 --> 19:14.050
Ah, a spy!

19:14.083 --> 19:15.250
[Maniacal
laughter]

19:15.283 --> 19:17.366
You've been exposed!

19:17.400 --> 19:19.216
Oops.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.183
Huh? What?

19:22.216 --> 19:24.083
Welcome to my studio.

19:24.116 --> 19:28.083
It's time
for your portrait,
agent Dexter.

19:28.116 --> 19:32.116
My personal camera emits
a special photon beam,

19:32.150 --> 19:38.100
which, on contact,
will destabilize
and reassemble your particles,

19:38.133 --> 19:39.283
which leaves you...

19:39.316 --> 19:42.383
Immortalized
in a lovely 8 x 10 glossy.

19:42.416 --> 19:43.333
[Laughing]

19:43.366 --> 19:44.466
It's a...[Sniff]

19:45.000 --> 19:46.083
Really lovely photo

19:46.116 --> 19:51.233
which captures
your very essence
actually well.

19:51.266 --> 19:53.416
Do you expect me
to talk?

19:53.450 --> 19:57.266
No, agent Dexter.
I expect you to smile.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.366
Sir, high commander parallax
on line one.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.316
Oh, thank you.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.316
What is your bidding,
master?

20:02.350 --> 20:04.183
Have you disposed
of the intruder?

20:04.216 --> 20:07.133
I'm taking his portrait
as we speak.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.100
[Straining]

20:09.133 --> 20:10.100
Excellent.

20:10.133 --> 20:10.483

20:11.016 --> 20:11.416
[Horn honks]

20:11.450 --> 20:14.200
Oh, hold on a sec,
will you?

20:15.233 --> 20:17.316
Do you have
the photos?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.016
Yes, my lord.

20:19.050 --> 20:22.150
So that's
where they are.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.433
Apparently you did not know
about my latest technology

20:28.466 --> 20:31.216
to get the red out.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.300
[Screaming]

20:36.033 --> 20:38.333
Katka, meet me back
at the photo shack.

20:38.366 --> 20:40.416
I'm taking a shortcut.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.450
Ha! I have you now,
parallax.

20:43.483 --> 20:46.133
Unhand those photos!

20:46.166 --> 20:48.200
Too late, chump.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.283
Your mom has them.

20:54.316 --> 20:55.200
Ha ha ha!

20:55.233 --> 20:59.166
You'll never get me!

21:00.266 --> 21:02.283
Rats.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.233
Look at this one,

21:06.266 --> 21:07.350
and this one here.

21:07.383 --> 21:10.166
Well, i--
how did this happen?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.350
I just don't
understand.

21:12.383 --> 21:14.050
No!

21:14.200 --> 21:17.083
Mom, I meant
to tell you all along.

21:17.116 --> 21:20.316
It--it just got
out of hand, and I...

21:20.350 --> 21:24.000
What are you
talking about?

21:28.400 --> 21:29.383
Dee Dee!

21:29.416 --> 21:30.433
