    and that's to put together  

00:21.389 --> 00:24.790
  The best team i possibly can, 
    moving into the playoffs.   

00:24.826 --> 00:27.293
     They're gonna have to      
     bring their "a" game if    
     they're gonna move on.

    I wanted to be an adviser   
          on "the voice"        

00:45.847 --> 00:47.413
  Because i'm a fan of the show.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.081

     their own songs.           

00:56.390 --> 00:58.324
   I'm not gonna lie to you.    
I'm very nervous about this one.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.792
            Pharrell:           
    Don't pick the right song,  

00:59.827 --> 01:01.560
     That could result in you   
           going home.          

01:01.596 --> 01:03.429
You're singing that song

02:19.407 --> 02:21.473
 Key adviser, superstar rihanna,

02:21.509 --> 02:23.576
       To help their teams      
        in the knockouts.       

02:23.611 --> 02:25.311
I decided a long time ago       
     on the show,               

02:25.346 --> 02:27.613
Like, make them feel good,      
give them the right tools,      

02:27.648 --> 02:30.149
      And, like,                
nurture them, almost.           

02:30.184 --> 02:32.251
           You're like a dad,   
        and these are your kids.

  My babies.

    Adam: Rihanna is gonna be   
      an incredible adviser.    

02:35.623 --> 02:38.891
She is so fiercely her own thing
 and so unique and so special.  

02:38.926 --> 02:41.193
   We're all taking             
hip-hop classes on my team.

     a pleasure to be around.   

02:45.099 --> 02:47.900
She's a really refreshing spirit
        in the universe.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.839

02:53.874 --> 02:56.242
 You really start to see who's  
got the warrior spirit for this.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.343
               Yes.             

02:57.378 --> 02:58.310
  My team is stronger than ever,

02:58.346 --> 02:59.511
    But they have to continue   
             to grow.           

02:59.547 --> 03:00.646
   I got some tough decisions.  

03:02.183 --> 03:04.984
       Here is the pairing      
       going voice-to-voice

 Before we get to this knockout,

03:22.336 --> 03:25.337
  Let's take a look at how they 
 prepared for tonight's matchup.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.007
     Adam: I put andi & alex    
       and blaine together      

03:28.042 --> 03:31.010
     Because he speaks to the   
    off-the-beaten-path thing   

03:31.045 --> 03:33.946
     That i think andi & alex   
       can also relate to.      

03:33.981 --> 03:36.148
    Hello, girls.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.916
        Adam:                   
All right, freak out.           
             Hi.                

03:37.952 --> 03:39.084

    How are you?                

03:47.762 --> 03:49.128
              Is this real life?
              It was just crazy.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.596
Do you guys sing together       
    all the time?               

03:50.631 --> 03:51.764
                    Yeah.       
          All the time.         

03:51.799 --> 03:53.032
                  We've been    
               singing together 

03:53.067 --> 03:54.600
                    Since       
             we were itty-bitty.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.102

04:02.176 --> 04:03.242
For our blind audition,         

04:03.277 --> 04:04.977
We had all four chairs          
     turn around.               

04:05.012 --> 04:06.178
   I think you guys             
      are one of                

04:06.213 --> 04:09.581
The most perfectly fitting duos 
   i've ever heard.             

04:09.617 --> 04:12.518
Alex: We picked adam.           
He is super encouraging.        

04:12.553 --> 04:14.186
 And we want to keep            
  making him proud.             

04:14.221 --> 04:16.120
    The winner of this battle   
         is andi & alex.        

04:16.156 --> 04:18.390
This whole experience           
has definitely ignited          

04:18.426 --> 04:19.992
       Our love                 
 for music together.            

04:20.027 --> 04:21.894
And it's a last chance          

04:21.928 --> 04:25.064
At our childhood dreams         
     coming true.               

04:25.099 --> 04:26.098
   What song is it?             

04:26.133 --> 04:27.566
                 "stupid boy"   
               by keith urban.  

04:27.601 --> 04:28.701
              Nice.             
                         Uh-huh.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.935
Rihanna thought that song       
    was about me.               

04:29.970 --> 04:31.003
Makes sense.                    
           Girl power.          

04:31.038 --> 04:32.037
           It's all right.      

04:32.073 --> 04:33.339
         Andi: The type of music
               that we play

            doing a country song

04:37.745 --> 04:39.945

    that we are kind of diverse.

           you can tell         

04:45.920 --> 04:49.455
    They have their own vibe,   
     and -- and i adore that.

   That's so good,              
      you guys.

            Together,           
  you guys sound so incredible, 

05:02.069 --> 05:04.636
   But it's almost like you're  
    afraid of your own voice.   

05:04.672 --> 05:05.704
    Adam: Yes.                  
                   Yeah.        

05:05.740 --> 05:07.139
         And you have to be bold
         by yourself.           

05:07.174 --> 05:09.408
   That's not a volume thing.   
                         Okay.  

05:09.443 --> 05:10.976
         It's more the presence.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.878
      The guitar                
 scares me a little.            

05:12.913 --> 05:14.012
  I don't ever like             
     to feel like               

05:14.048 --> 05:15.180
  You're backing up             
     your sister.               

05:15.216 --> 05:16.715
Can we maybe try this one       
 without the guitar?            

05:16.751 --> 05:17.583
                 Absolutely.    

05:17.618 --> 05:18.617
       Adam: Andi & alex --     

05:18.652 --> 05:19.752
    They've always been great   

05:19.787 --> 05:21.754
    At singing these ethereal,  
         eerie harmonies.       

05:21.789 --> 05:25.758
      ¶ she never even knew

        from this planet.       

05:27.595 --> 05:29.795
      So, in the beginning,     
       i wouldn't even mind     

05:29.830 --> 05:30.963
 If you were kind of facing away
         from each other.       

05:30.998 --> 05:32.331
     Andi: Okay.                

05:32.366 --> 05:34.199
  Because i've never seen that  
           with a duo.          
  Yeah.                         

05:34.235 --> 05:35.000
    Ooh, that's really strong.  

05:35.035 --> 05:35.901
         "stupid boy" --        

05:35.936 --> 05:37.436
     Like, this is personal.    

05:37.471 --> 05:39.805
   You're obviously not talking 
       about the same boy,      

05:39.840 --> 05:41.874
 So you can't share that thought
        with your sister.       

05:41.909 --> 05:43.509
         Adam: If you're        
       standing over here,      

05:43.544 --> 05:45.010
           Like, okay,          
       like, i'm over here.     

05:45.045 --> 05:46.412
            You know,           
    and one of you over here.   
                         Yeah.  

05:46.447 --> 05:47.713
           You got both of      
           these quadrants here.

05:47.748 --> 05:48.981
     And then you come together,
     and it's like, "whoa!"     

05:49.016 --> 05:50.983
It's like you guys are          
in separate bedrooms...         

05:51.018 --> 05:52.284
                    Yeah.       

05:52.319 --> 05:53.652
...And you're venting           
     to yourself                

05:53.687 --> 05:54.953
And, like, just upset.          

05:54.989 --> 05:57.823
And then you can rejoice        
in coming together.             
                 Okay.          

05:57.858 --> 06:00.159
          Lift the song         
   with a whole other dynamic.  

06:00.194 --> 06:01.593
You guys are incredible.        

06:01.629 --> 06:03.028
        Before the blinds,      

06:03.063 --> 06:05.497
     I was playing in a band    
         with my brother,       

06:05.533 --> 06:07.766
       250 shows in a year.     

06:07.802 --> 06:10.102
   So, getting a blind audition 
           was surreal.         

06:10.137 --> 06:11.970
       Gwen and blake both      
      turned around for me.     

06:12.006 --> 06:13.205
         That note that you hit,

06:13.240 --> 06:14.573
              And you just held 
               for a long time, 

06:14.608 --> 06:16.775
     And then your voice kind of
      got gravelly and raspy... 

06:16.811 --> 06:18.243
               I'm a fan, dude. 

06:18.279 --> 06:19.845
    Blake's an awesome coach.   

06:19.880 --> 06:21.980
   I think you should rock out  
     like you normally would.   

06:22.016 --> 06:22.848
        Sweet.                  

06:22.883 --> 06:23.916
         It's a front-man thing,

06:23.951 --> 06:25.417
       And we wish we could move
               like that.       

06:25.453 --> 06:28.854
¶ i like that old time

06:28.889 --> 06:30.923

06:30.958 --> 06:34.526
  So, i lost the battle to joe, 
    but adam was like "boom!"   

06:34.562 --> 06:36.728
      Daly: That is a steal!

        through my jeans.

   to let the audience

                   Well, blaine,

11:53.213 --> 11:54.379
           I'm man enough to say

11:54.414 --> 11:56.915
      That i probably screwed up
       by letting you go, dude. 

11:56.950 --> 11:58.784

           of the lead?         

12:03.423 --> 12:04.823
                       Um, yeah.
        Because of that,

      airy voice, too,

        With a lot of volume.   

12:09.563 --> 12:10.896

        to be able

        To hear you stand out   
        on your own right there.

     for adam to think about.

        you have                

12:17.204 --> 12:20.438
        Is not choosing a song  
        so dynamic like blaine.

     Discovering andi's voice   
     this time a bit more       

12:26.847 --> 12:28.180
     Does lead you              
     to the question,           

12:28.215 --> 12:29.881
    "man, how come they couldn't
    have a song                 

12:29.917 --> 12:33.652
     That really showcases      
     what you guys do together

     And separately             
     a little bit better?"      

12:35.756 --> 12:38.123
    And then, blaine,           
    the moment that you just had

12:38.158 --> 12:41.493
    Is what every artist        
    should aspire to experience.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.295
     Everybody in the room      
     gets to discover           

12:43.330 --> 12:45.697

 than we ever thought.

     Being in the moment        

13:13.093 --> 13:15.160
     And experiencing that --   
     the emotion of the song -- 

13:15.195 --> 13:16.228

it was very important

to separate yourselves

    the youngest person here.   

16:36.430 --> 16:39.697
         I want to prove        
    that i'm a real contender.

For my knockout, i'll be singing
"feeling good" by michael bublé,

16:45.972 --> 16:48.673
         Because i listen       
  to frank sinatra, ray charles,

16:48.708 --> 16:51.276
    And a lot of people my age  
          don't do that.        

16:51.311 --> 16:52.710
    So i thought this would be  
           a cool song          

16:52.746 --> 16:55.013
     To show that older side    
            of things.          

16:55.048 --> 16:56.748
        ¶ it's a new day,

       and this curly hair.

    inside of that tiny body?   

17:11.631 --> 17:14.265
            I had a voice crack,
           and i was like, "ew."

17:14.300 --> 17:16.935
      If your voice cracks,     
     just commit to the note.   

17:16.970 --> 17:18.470
       Those imperfections      

17:18.505 --> 17:22.607
      Are what is gonna make    
   the character of your voice. 

17:22.642 --> 17:24.709
I feel like you were rushing it 
a little bit at the end,

        thing for braiden       

17:31.218 --> 17:33.818
      Is getting comfortable    
         in his own skin.       

17:33.854 --> 17:36.521
 Maybe you could just take this 
off and just do the second part,

17:36.556 --> 17:38.456
      But live the character    
           in the song.         

17:38.492 --> 17:40.658

28:19.966 --> 28:21.398
        Just want you to make up
        a nickname for me.      

28:21.434 --> 28:22.266
          That's all i'm saying.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.901
                    Done.       
      Okay.

28:26.506 --> 28:28.806
   You know, in the knockouts,  
        i've got one goal,      

28:28.841 --> 28:31.542
    And that's to put together  
  the best team i possibly can, 

28:31.577 --> 28:32.877
   Moving into the live shows.  

28:32.912 --> 28:35.179
   I want one of these artists  
        to win this thing.      

28:35.214 --> 28:37.815
      These are the artists     
       going voice-to-voice

28:47.560 --> 28:49.693
                It's barrett.   

28:53.366 --> 28:55.132
        What do you think       
       about this pairing?      

28:55.168 --> 28:56.534
              Barrett is a heck 
                 of a singer,   

28:56.569 --> 28:58.269
 And this is definitely gonna be
       a challenge for me.      

28:58.304 --> 28:59.804
             Barrett?           

28:59.839 --> 29:01.105
I love him as a singer,         

29:01.140 --> 29:04.041
But i love him as a human being 
     most of all.               

29:04.076 --> 29:05.276
      And as they get ready     
     for their performances,    

29:05.311 --> 29:07.611
          Here's a look         
         at this matchup.       

29:07.647 --> 29:09.914
     Blake: I paired barrett    
          and blind joe         

29:09.949 --> 29:12.750
  Because they're my two strong 
        country veterans.       

29:12.785 --> 29:14.185
  They have so much experience, 

29:14.220 --> 29:16.887
    It only seems fair to put   
  these two against each other. 

29:16.923 --> 29:20.424
        My goal is really       
       to honor the people      

29:20.459 --> 29:22.726
          That i endured        
      the plane crash with.

              Whoo!             

29:29.569 --> 29:30.701
 Are you, obviously,            
a professional singer?          

29:30.736 --> 29:31.735
    I'm a high-school teacher.  

29:31.771 --> 29:33.637
  Oh, wow.                      
     [ cheers and applause ]    

29:33.673 --> 29:35.840
               The way that you 
               perform onstage, 

29:35.875 --> 29:37.308
            It was like watching
              garth up there.   

29:37.343 --> 29:39.009
       I really think blake     
      has already helped me     

29:39.045 --> 29:40.444
     Become a better artist.    

29:40.479 --> 29:42.847
        You just have that thing
        that nobody can explain,

29:42.882 --> 29:44.415
                But, clearly,   
               we all like it.  

29:44.450 --> 29:46.317
   And i can't wait to continue 
           this journey         

29:46.352 --> 29:47.451
     And keep working hard...   

29:47.486 --> 29:48.752
     [ squeals ]                

29:48.788 --> 29:50.721
       ...And make my kids      
        and my wife proud.      

29:50.756 --> 29:52.256

29:52.291 --> 29:53.324
                   Barrett!     

29:53.359 --> 29:56.293
  Bar-- there he is.            

29:56.329 --> 29:57.361
           Rihanna: Hi, barrett.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.597
          Hey! Oh, wow.         

29:59.632 --> 30:01.866
         Seeing rihanna,        
       it was just like...      
  You're here.                  

30:01.901 --> 30:03.267
  ..."this is actually

         but i need you ¶       

30:10.409 --> 30:12.276

         "colder weather"       

30:12.311 --> 30:14.144

     with the song lyrically.

  ¶ 'cause i'm a ramblin' man ¶

    to leave my kids and wife

     To go chase this dream,    

30:23.356 --> 30:25.489
      And that's really what    
    "colder weather" is about.  

30:25.524 --> 30:29.126
          When you were doing   
        those really soft notes,

30:29.161 --> 30:31.795
Make sure you always feel       
that vibration in your chest.   
                    Got it.     

30:31.831 --> 30:34.498
           She's right.         
   Sometimes you'll throw away  

30:34.533 --> 30:36.934

       like, really quick.

     and it's gone real fast.

Right now, i feel you're being  
polite in your performance.

       to steal our hearts.

  He is going to have to commit 
         to the emotions        

30:53.886 --> 30:56.487
    And he's gonna have to be   
            fearless.

     for a spin?                

40:57.923 --> 40:59.523
                In the chair?   
   Yeah.                        

40:59.558 --> 41:01.424
        I've actually been dying
              to do that.       

41:01.460 --> 41:02.292
        Okay.                   

41:02.327 --> 41:04.828
                      ¶         

41:04.863 --> 41:06.696
                Tell me when.   
                Tell me when.   

41:06.732 --> 41:08.798
    And...Action!               

41:08.834 --> 41:12.168
                 [ chuckles ]   

41:12.204 --> 41:13.970
                    Boom!       

41:14.006 --> 41:18.308
    I want to an "other" team   
         to the playoffs,       

41:18.343 --> 41:20.076
      Meaning not the same.     

41:20.112 --> 41:22.746
   I'm looking for individuals. 

41:22.781 --> 41:24.848
     I paired amy versus madi   

41:24.883 --> 41:28.184
      Because they both have    
   these really delicate voices 

41:28.220 --> 41:29.653
      That also have power.     

41:29.688 --> 41:31.521
   It's a very competitive spot 
        between those two,      

41:31.557 --> 41:33.456
'cause they're both really good.

41:33.492 --> 41:36.359
      Madi: Before my blind,    
  i was just a girl from dallas 

41:36.395 --> 41:38.328
Doing gigs, like, every weekend.

41:38.363 --> 41:39.930
       ¶ there's something      
           wrong here ¶         

41:39.965 --> 41:42.999
   ¶ there can be no denyin' ¶  

41:43.035 --> 41:44.868
How old are you?                
             I'm 16.            

41:44.903 --> 41:46.436
             Oh, my god!        

41:46.471 --> 41:49.439
              Voices like yours 
              really excite me. 

41:49.474 --> 41:50.974
        I want what's different.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.175
         I pick pharrell.       

41:52.210 --> 41:54.210
      Pharrell knows how to     
      push you not too hard     

41:54.246 --> 41:56.379
     But just enough to where   
      you surprise yourself.    

41:56.415 --> 41:58.548
                Madi, you rose  
               to the occasion. 

41:58.584 --> 42:01.084
        You can't buy this      
       kind of experience.      

42:01.119 --> 42:04.921
      ¶ just before our love    
      got lost you said... ¶    

42:04.957 --> 42:06.089
   For my knockout performance, 

42:06.124 --> 42:07.857
     I chose "a case of you"    
        by joni mitchell.       

42:07.893 --> 42:10.460
    ¶ "...As a northern star,"  
         and i said... ¶        

42:10.495 --> 42:12.929
     She embodies what i want   
      to be as an artist --     

42:12.965 --> 42:14.531
    Someone who's innovative.   

42:14.566 --> 42:16.032
     And i couldn't think of    

42:16.068 --> 42:18.468
       A more powerful song     
         for this moment.       

42:18.503 --> 42:22.439
       ¶ you're in my blood     
         like holy wine ¶       

42:22.474 --> 42:23.940
    ¶ you taste so bitter... ¶  

42:23.976 --> 42:25.275
 The song choice made me realize

42:25.310 --> 42:26.910
      How much of an artist     
          she really is.        

42:26.945 --> 42:28.578
          ¶ yo-o-o-o-u ¶        

42:28.614 --> 42:29.946
         Hey!                   

42:29.982 --> 42:32.048
     I mean, she just totally   
       blew me away today.      

42:32.084 --> 42:33.984
       What was                 
   that gospel run?             

42:34.019 --> 42:36.152
        Adele does those        
        effortless runs.        
                      Yes!      

42:36.188 --> 42:37.954
   When were you gonna tell me  
        that you do that?       

42:37.990 --> 42:40.023
           You don't even have  
          a joni mitchell voice.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.192
         You literally are doing
             your own thing.    

42:42.227 --> 42:45.328
    It's two different artists  
   that i've heard in one song, 

42:45.364 --> 42:46.796
      And that is brilliant.    

42:46.832 --> 42:50.200
        Your full tone --       
   i want you to round it out.  

42:50.235 --> 42:52.369
   Don't make it sound ¶ ehh! ¶ 

42:52.404 --> 42:55.038
      Make it sound like --     
             ¶ aah! ¶           

42:55.073 --> 42:57.007
                           Okay.
        I don't want you        
       just to be louder.       

42:57.042 --> 42:59.809
 I want you to be like, "this is
    my <i> other</i> type of voice."    
fuller.                         

42:59.845 --> 43:00.944
   Pharrell: Yeah.              

43:00.979 --> 43:02.679
   Madi has a really rich tone  

43:02.714 --> 43:04.981
        That she's almost       
         afraid of using.       

43:05.017 --> 43:09.586
            ¶ you're in my blood
              like holy wine ¶  

43:09.621 --> 43:11.021
 That was emotional.            

43:11.056 --> 43:13.390
  You are an artist.            

43:13.425 --> 43:15.458
 You're not just some contestant
            on a show.          

43:15.494 --> 43:18.495
"the voice" reminds me of what  
the music industry ud to be.    

43:18.530 --> 43:20.230
Someone would come in           
     your office,               

43:20.265 --> 43:22.132
 And they would sing            
  and you'd feel it.            

43:22.167 --> 43:24.234
     Artists know               
   when to do that.             

43:24.269 --> 43:27.637
     When you start to sing,    
     we are in <i> your</i> feelings.   

43:27.673 --> 43:28.838
         Yes.                   

43:28.874 --> 43:30.273
     We want to be all eyes,    

43:30.308 --> 43:32.609
  Tunnel vision on the emotions 
   that you're feeling up here. 

43:32.644 --> 43:36.346
   In order for madi to win,    
she just needs to be who she is,

43:36.381 --> 43:38.581
     'cause when she's in her   
   comfort zone, she's amazing. 

43:38.617 --> 43:41.384
            You got a good team.
Yeah, man.                      

43:41.420 --> 43:44.154
        Going from playing      
       in these small cafés     

43:44.189 --> 43:47.624
    And tiny bars in brooklyn   
    to coming to "the voice,"   

43:47.659 --> 43:48.858
     It's a whole new world.    

43:48.894 --> 43:52.896
  ¶ dream a little dream of me ¶

43:52.931 --> 43:54.264
     [ cheers and applause ]    

43:54.299 --> 43:55.732
        Blind auditions --      

43:55.767 --> 43:58.001
    Kind of, like, blacked out  
       from the excitement.     

43:58.070 --> 43:59.836
                 I'm looking    
               at a superstar.  

43:59.871 --> 44:01.671
               Please pick me.  

44:01.707 --> 44:04.074
Let me be the guy that helps you
      explore that sound.       

44:04.109 --> 44:06.009
        I pick...Pharrell.      

44:06.044 --> 44:07.177
     [ cheers and applause ]    
              ohh!              

44:07.212 --> 44:09.079
"adam's team is full.           

44:09.114 --> 44:11.681
Bring out the greatest singer   
on the show's history,          

44:11.717 --> 44:13.083
And the most beautiful.         

44:13.118 --> 44:14.918
Yeah. Cue her."                 
                    [ laughs ]  

44:14.953 --> 44:17.787
  I am just loving every moment 
      of this whole process,    

44:17.823 --> 44:20.757
     And i'm just gonna take    
   everything that i've learned 

44:20.792 --> 44:23.159
        And use it to keep      
         working harder.        

44:23.195 --> 44:27.864
  ¶ i want a sunday kind of... ¶

44:27.899 --> 44:29.699
     For the knockout rounds,   

44:29.735 --> 44:32.569
 I chose "a sunday kind of love"
          by etta james.        

44:32.604 --> 44:34.771
      ¶ a love to last... ¶     

44:34.806 --> 44:36.973
  It's totally in my wheelhouse,

44:37.008 --> 44:40.243
    Like, singer/songwriter-y,  
          little jazzy.         

44:40.278 --> 44:42.212
That should have just           
    been recorded.              

44:42.247 --> 44:43.613
           [ laughter ]         

44:43.648 --> 44:45.782
Now, if you're gonna stay low,  
there needs to be some depth.   

44:45.817 --> 44:48.718
 So, certain places,            
switch from that head voice     

44:48.754 --> 44:52.222
To chest voice just to intensify
the performance.                
              Yeah.             

44:52.257 --> 44:53.857
          You're singing        
       an etta james song.      

44:53.892 --> 44:56.259
     I mean, this is a woman    
   with attitude, first of all. 

44:56.294 --> 44:58.361
  Guitar has to go.             

44:58.396 --> 44:59.462
                    Okay.       

44:59.498 --> 45:00.630
     It's a song                
   about a fantasy.             

45:00.665 --> 45:02.899
                  I want you    
             to be in the music,

45:02.934 --> 45:04.501
Just lost in the music.         

45:04.536 --> 45:08.371
I want you to fantasize         
about the perfect man.          

45:08.406 --> 45:09.506
      I don't get that here.    

45:09.541 --> 45:10.573
                   Mm-hmm.      
   Wow.                         

45:10.609 --> 45:12.108
That was entertaining           
    to watch you.               

45:12.144 --> 45:13.243
       [ laughs ] shut up.      
[ chuckles ]                    

45:13.278 --> 45:14.511
But it was                      
also entertaining               

45:14.546 --> 45:16.880
To look over at her             
just be like, "yeah!"           

45:16.915 --> 45:17.981
           [ laughter ]         

45:18.016 --> 45:20.150
     You know how to do that.   
          Don't be shy.         

45:20.185 --> 45:22.685
      Rihanna -- i was just     
        kind of mind-blown      

45:22.721 --> 45:24.287
  By everything she was saying. 

45:24.322 --> 45:25.822
     ¶ and i'd like to know... ¶

45:25.857 --> 45:27.323
   It's a little intimidating,  

45:27.392 --> 45:30.126
'cause she just oozes confidence
       out of every pore.       

45:30.162 --> 45:31.127
           [ chuckles ]         

45:31.163 --> 45:32.629
        Did you feel sexy?      

45:32.664 --> 45:33.930
                     No.        

45:33.965 --> 45:35.532
      I want you to be raw.     

45:35.567 --> 45:37.367
          If your hands         
     never touch the mike...    

45:37.402 --> 45:39.469
                     Mm-hmm.    
       ...They'll help you      
       to make me believe       

45:39.504 --> 45:40.603
       That you're feeling it.  

45:40.639 --> 45:41.671
                    Yeah.       

45:41.706 --> 45:43.673
    I was trying to bring her   
        out of her shell.       

45:43.708 --> 45:45.208
  You could pull your hair down 
          in your face.         

45:45.243 --> 45:47.043
      And i didn't want her     
          to look at us         

45:47.078 --> 45:48.511
    Or feel us looking at her   

45:48.547 --> 45:52.582
    So that she can just feel   
  her body do different things. 

45:52.617 --> 45:56.152

     In order for her to win    
          this knockout,        

46:02.761 --> 46:04.894
      She's got to continue     
      to come out swinging.     

46:04.930 --> 46:06.496
  I've not seen you             
   like this, amy.              

46:06.531 --> 46:08.198

 Okay.

53:51.996 --> 53:55.631
   Amy vachal is in a fight now 
         for a new coach.       

53:55.667 --> 53:57.333
   That what i'm talking about! 

53:57.368 --> 53:59.068
                   Whoo!        
           So excited right now.

53:59.103 --> 54:00.436
            My heart's pounding.

54:00.471 --> 54:03.105
     Well, where should i begin?
            I know where.       

54:03.141 --> 54:04.440
           [ laughter ]         

54:04.475 --> 54:07.310
      At the blind auditions,   
    i did hit my button for you,

54:07.345 --> 54:10.980
 And i remember begging, because
     i believe you're a star.   

54:11.015 --> 54:12.648
     [ cheers and applause ]    
                    you're still
              one of my favorite

54:12.684 --> 54:16.585
   Artists who's ever auditioned
   fothis show, ever.           

54:16.621 --> 54:19.555
   And i've won this show       
   a bunch of times, by the way.

54:19.590 --> 54:20.823
           [ laughter ]         

54:20.858 --> 54:22.992
       Like, twice as many times
                as adam.        

54:23.027 --> 54:23.993
     Yeah, okay.                

54:24.028 --> 54:25.528
         And i may not seem like

54:25.563 --> 54:28.130
              The perfect match 
                   for you,     

54:28.166 --> 54:30.566
              But i'll be damned
                 if i'm not.    

54:30.601 --> 54:32.401
       And i cannot even believe

54:32.437 --> 54:34.670
          That there's even this
          opportunity right now.

54:34.706 --> 54:36.839
        And i can't wrap my head
          around you possibly   

54:36.874 --> 54:38.774
      Going with sinéad o'connor
             down there.

                           hey. 

54:41.012 --> 54:44.513
   When he gets done with       
   his blue man group auditions,

54:44.549 --> 54:48.084
         Maybe he'll have time  
         to work with you and --

54:48.119 --> 54:49.719
Uh, it's the jew man group,     
      actually.                 

54:49.754 --> 54:51.487
          [ laughter ]          
um...                           

54:51.522 --> 54:52.722
          Oh, my gosh.          
So --                           

54:52.757 --> 54:54.023
            Hey, this would work
                a lot better    

54:54.058 --> 54:55.524
      If you would do this while
       you're saying all that.  

54:55.560 --> 54:56.792
           [ laughter ]         

54:56.828 --> 54:58.728
           If you would do that.

55:00.131 --> 55:01.831
        Kids.                   

55:01.866 --> 55:04.567
       Listen,                  
during the blind auditions,     

55:04.602 --> 55:06.769
I thought, "wow, this girl      
could win the whole thing,      

55:06.804 --> 55:08.270
And i didn't even have          
      a chance."                

55:08.306 --> 55:10.072
   So, i felt like              
 i really missed out,           

55:10.108 --> 55:12.308
    And now i feel              
     like i know                

55:12.343 --> 55:15.811
      What to do                
to really help you thrive.      

55:15.847 --> 55:17.546
I do believe that you can       
win this whole thing.           

55:17.582 --> 55:19.148
I believed it from the moment   
i first heard you sing.         

55:19.183 --> 55:21.183
Now i get to -- a chance        
 to be a part of it,            

55:21.219 --> 55:22.318
    So i'm really,              
    like, excited.              

55:22.353 --> 55:23.686

55:23.721 --> 55:26.122

     your new coach gonna be?

      [ audience shouting ]     

55:29.093 --> 55:30.960

55:30.995 --> 55:34.563
        Thank you so much       
     for everything you said.   

55:36.401 --> 55:39.335

   go with my gut on this one.

...Pushed their buttons to steal
amy vachal from team pharrell.

   Wah!                         

55:54.252 --> 55:56.719
   Daly: Now she has            
   the difficult decision       

55:56.754 --> 55:58.454
   Of picking her new coach.

                             oh.

       steals amy vachal...     

56:10.701 --> 56:12.067
                  Thank god!

           and blake.           
   Yes.

   I can't move.                
   I'm paralyzed.

             Good luck, sweetie.
           Thank you.           

56:21.813 --> 56:23.345
      I know i couldn't have    
            gone wrong

     Between the two of them,   

56:24.348 --> 56:25.815
        But i picked adam       

56:25.850 --> 56:29.118
         Because i think        
     he just really gets me.

   I know i'm just gonna learn  
        so much from him,

   [ laughs ]

   Adam: When you don't have    
   a big, giant voice,          

56:38.763 --> 56:40.729
   You got to capture the world 
   with your imagination        

56:40.765 --> 56:41.764
   And with your creativity,    

56:41.799 --> 56:43.199

   that she can do that.

           You're in good hands.
           We're gonna have fun,

  everything about amy's voice,

    And i just think it sucks   
       that, two times now,

     [ laughing ] so stupid.    

57:09.427 --> 57:11.594

of a nickname for me?           

57:11.629 --> 57:12.561
                    Toad?

    Oh, i get it.               

57:15.633 --> 57:19.368
 Like...Kiss the frog           
and he turns into a prince?     

57:19.403 --> 57:20.569
      I get it.                 
                     Exactly.   

57:20.605 --> 57:21.504
                Yeah, that's it.
   Are you really               
    hitting on me               

57:21.539 --> 57:22.805
    On national television      
    right now?                  

57:22.840 --> 57:24.440
             Can we cut, please?
I'm flattered.

      final knockout pairing    

57:26.210 --> 57:27.610
          Of the night.         

57:27.645 --> 57:29.478
      Blake: I paired chance    
  and ivonne against each other 

57:29.514 --> 57:33.182
  Because they're my two steals,
     and both are very young,   

57:33.217 --> 57:34.583
  They both deserve to be here, 

57:34.619 --> 57:37.152
But i can only bring one of them
     to the live playoffs.      

57:37.188 --> 57:38.454
    Coming on to "the voice,"   

57:38.489 --> 57:40.556
     I was just a 15-year-old   
         high-school kid        

57:40.591 --> 57:43.492
     Who played gigs in bars    
 and working in my parents' gym.

57:43.528 --> 57:45.127
  I was so drawn in,            

57:45.162 --> 57:47.329
I couldn't believe that these   
guys weren't turning around.    

57:47.365 --> 57:49.198
   Chance: To be on adam's team 
        is amazing,             

57:49.233 --> 57:51.333
       And i've been a fan      
  of his music for a long time.

 ¶ if i could, then i would... ¶

57:54.739 --> 57:56.272

57:56.307 --> 57:57.339
     [ cheers and applause ]    

57:57.375 --> 57:59.441
  But blake used his last steal 
              on me.            

57:59.477 --> 58:03.612
    If i was 15, i would have   
  chance's posters in my locker,

58:03.648 --> 58:05.614
  And i would be losing my mind 
            over you.           

58:05.650 --> 58:06.916
            Thank you.          

58:06.951 --> 58:09.985
    There's something completely
     magical about your voice.  

58:10.021 --> 58:11.720
        He's a heartthrob.      
         Forget about it.       

58:11.756 --> 58:13.289
        You won the show.       

58:13.324 --> 58:14.757
I think they're great.          
I definitely think              
you were gonna...               

58:14.792 --> 58:17.126
     I just want to show him    
  that he made the right choice.

58:19.997 --> 58:22.598
    ¶ and the cards all fold ¶  

58:22.633 --> 58:25.734

   "demons" by imagine dragons.

    ¶ i wanna hide the truth ¶  

58:28.940 --> 58:31.340
      I'm a folk musician,      
but i feel like, with this song,

58:31.375 --> 58:33.509
     I can prove that i'm not   
      boxed in to one genre.    

58:33.544 --> 58:36.712
That voice on a record          
  would be awesome.             

58:36.747 --> 58:38.447
      Your voice is so cool.    

58:38.482 --> 58:40.215
        It's so different.      

58:40.251 --> 58:41.717
                  Thank you.    

58:41.752 --> 58:42.751
    You ever listen to elvis?   

58:42.787 --> 58:44.253
                Occasionally.   

58:44.288 --> 58:45.454
        'cause your voice       
         can do all that.       

58:45.489 --> 58:46.322
                  Thank you.    

58:46.357 --> 58:48.290
         In the beginning       
           of the song,         

58:48.326 --> 58:49.959
          You're getting        
        a little bit flat.      

58:49.994 --> 58:52.695
            Sometimes,          
    when a song is really low,  

58:52.730 --> 58:54.563
        We tend to think,       
     "let's get really low,"    

58:54.599 --> 58:57.099
     And we could fall short    
           of the note.         

58:57.134 --> 58:58.934
   All of a sudden,             
your voice just disappears.     

58:58.970 --> 59:01.103
I couldn't even tell if you were
even hitting the note or not.   

59:01.138 --> 59:03.672
             Just go full voice.
    You can hit those notes.    

59:03.708 --> 59:04.707
                           Okay.
              Yeah.             

59:04.742 --> 59:06.575
     Chance is really young,    

59:06.611 --> 59:09.678
    But he has this old voice   
             in him.            

59:09.714 --> 59:12.247
     ¶ don't get too close ¶    

59:12.283 --> 59:14.416
       ¶ it's dark inside ¶     

59:16.087 --> 59:18.120
The only thing that you're      
   gonna need to do             

59:18.155 --> 59:19.955
Is open up on those things      
   that you switch              

59:19.991 --> 59:22.024
From falsetto back              
to full voice now.              
                       Uh-huh.  

59:22.059 --> 59:23.993
          'cause i can tell     
          you're, like, choking,

59:24.028 --> 59:26.028
    Like, you're pinching it off
    a little bit.               

59:26.063 --> 59:28.964
        Instead of ¶ to ¶       
         just go ¶ to! ¶        

59:29.000 --> 59:31.300
    It'll trail off naturally.  
     Don't worry about that.    

59:31.335 --> 59:33.602
   Chance is only 15 years old. 

59:33.638 --> 59:36.271
      I see something in him    
         that's special.        

59:36.307 --> 59:38.641
   I'm so glad i stole chance.  
     I mean, what a surprise.   

59:38.676 --> 59:41.310
         ¶ dhide ¶              
       wow.                     

59:41.345 --> 59:42.811
   Hey, do you want             
   to meet rihanna?             

59:42.847 --> 59:45.214
      Rihanna: How are you?     
              Good. How are you?

59:45.249 --> 59:46.615
    I'm a huge fan of rihanna,  

59:46.651 --> 59:49.618
   And i just really admire her 
          as an artist.         

59:49.654 --> 59:50.853
      She's wicked awesome.     
           [ chuckles ]         

59:50.888 --> 59:52.454
        So, he stole you?       
                           Yeah.

59:52.490 --> 59:55.658
She was at season 8?            
                         Mm-hmm.

59:55.693 --> 59:57.693
She auditioned and didn't make  
  it on to the show.            

59:57.728 --> 59:59.395
          Comeback girl.        

59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.397
And picked a whole bunch        
of cantaloupes on the farm,     

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:02.998
Singing the whole time,         
   got way better.              

01:00:03.034 --> 01:00:04.066
           Yeah. Yeah.          

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.668
    If you would have told me   
            a year ago          

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.102
That i'd be standing here today,

01:00:07.138 --> 01:00:08.871
         I would be like,       
       "ha. You're funny."      

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:11.874
   Not getting a chair season 8 
           was brutal.          

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.942
         Let that microphone go.

01:00:13.978 --> 01:00:15.778
      You have an enormous gift.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.212
   Don't wrap it up             
      like that.                

01:00:17.248 --> 01:00:18.647
         But i came back.       

01:00:18.683 --> 01:00:21.583
       ¶ take me ho-o-ome ¶     

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:24.086
     I got gwen and pharrell    
      to turn around for me.    

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.087
           Gwen: Hey.           
                          Whoa. 
Adam: Hey!                      

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.488
               I recognize her. 

01:00:26.524 --> 01:00:28.257
        You are a special,      
        super-unique thing      

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.591
 That we don't have on the show.

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:30.659
            Pharrell.           

01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:32.795
     [ cheers and applause ]    

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.931
   Jump out the window with me. 
      You're not gonna fall.    

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.833
        Ivonne: Ever since      
     my first blind audition,   

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:39.635
        I learned so much       
      from this competition.    

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.003
             Siahna.            

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.605
   Unfortunately, i didn't get  
        to win the battle,      

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.541
      But i did get stolen.     

01:00:45.576 --> 01:00:48.143
              Daly:             
       There's your steal!      
                        Yes!    

01:00:48.179 --> 01:00:50.279
            You stop that crying
                 right now.     

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.480
          I pick blake.         

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:53.215
                     Yes!       

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:59.188
        ¶ days like this,       
      i want to drive away ¶    

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:02.324
For my knockout, i'll be singing
  "part of me" by katy perry.   

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:03.926
        ¶ now look at me ¶      

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:06.428
   ¶ this is the part of me... ¶
     whoo!                      

01:01:06.464 --> 01:01:07.830
When katy perry wrote this song,

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:09.531
     She was going through      
     a tough time,              

01:01:09.567 --> 01:01:11.734
     So i really try to imagine 
     that feeling,              

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:13.535
     Like, not making a team -- 

01:01:13.571 --> 01:01:15.637
    That's not something i want 
    to have to go through again.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:16.939
     ¶ so... ¶                  

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:21.577
     Ivonne was timid, shy      
     when you speak to her.     

01:01:21.612 --> 01:01:24.980
    But when she starts to sing,
    she had her own voice,      

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.316
     Her own swagger            
     when it came to performing.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:30.452
                      ¶         

01:01:30.488 --> 01:01:31.620
           Oh, my god.          

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:32.721
 I can't wait to he             
    what you say.               

01:01:32.757 --> 01:01:33.822
           Wait. What?          

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:34.923
                 [ chuckles ]   

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.391
   Have you gotten              
   like 200% better             

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:37.993
    Than you were               
 in the battle round?           

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.728
              I'm hoping i did. 
     Wow.                       

01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:41.163
         You are amazing.       

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:42.498
                  Thank you.    

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:44.500
      Your voice is so rich     
          and beautiful.        

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:46.869
      Your vibrato is sick!     

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.403
              Thank you so much.

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:50.806
      Make sure you watch on    
 the first time you sing "soul."

01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:54.276
 Try to not do the vibrato there
          until the end,        

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:55.677
          Because it got        
       a little bit shaky.      

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:57.012
                    Okay.       

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.115
      And the second line,      
try to stay on key in that line,

01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:01.517
          'cause it got         
         a little pitchy.       

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:02.785
                           Okay.
              Yeah.             

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.653
You have been guilty of this    
     in the past                

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.356
  Is letting nerves             
 get the best of you,           

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:10.259
And whatever you've got to do   
to stay like this right now,    

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.694
Whenever the knockouts happen,  
        do it.                  

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:13.929
    You were born               
     to do this.                

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.330
                 Thank you.     
     Yeah.                      

01:02:15.366 --> 01:02:16.832
   Sometimes you use your steal 

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:19.368
   And the fact that you use it 
        gives that artist       

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:21.336
      Just a little bit more    
           confidence,          

01:02:21.372 --> 01:02:23.438
       And i saw that today     
           with ivonne.         

01:02:23.474 --> 01:02:26.608
Hey, you know, when the tabloids
start writing about us          

01:02:26.644 --> 01:02:29.945

that we got going on right now, 

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.547
    "blihanna" is               
  gonna be our name.            

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:34.416
Like, when the trash magazines  
start talking about us --       

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:35.417
     "blihanna."                

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:38.120
         Huh?                   

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:41.023
I thought about "rake,"         
    but that's --

                I'm blushing.   
               Can't you tell?  

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:51.133
        Singing "demons,"       
       here is chance peña.

         of the knockout?       

01:07:25.576 --> 01:07:27.542
     Chance, my favorite part   

01:07:27.578 --> 01:07:29.544
       Is your little yodel     
           that you do.

          to really hear

          All the vocals        
         that you can do.       

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.487

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.391

        and i was, "whoa!       

01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:45.660
She's singing right to my heart,
          right now."           

01:07:45.696 --> 01:07:48.230
And i wanted to jump up on stage
       and sing harmonies       

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.132
        And be like, "yes!      
       That's how i feel!"

    strategically,              

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:57.372
I thought it was too low.       

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.341

 to be a little more

   for this moment.

      just was,

And the second it was done,     

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:06.815
   You walked over              
   and you're like,             

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:08.116
  "that was really,             
    really good."

 what the outcome is,

           and struggled.

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:28.283
      That have advanced to     
    the live playoffs so far.   

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:31.119
      Adam picked pop rocker    
         blaine mitchell        

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:35.490
   And stole singer/songwriter  
    amy vachal from pharrell.   

01:11:35.525 --> 01:11:38.159
  Blake kept country/soul singer
          barrett baber

  Daly: Gwen chose pop vocalist 
        braiden sunshine.       

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:49.804
        And pharrell added      
  indie folk artist madi davis.

     Now let's meet the final   
  knockout pairing of the night.

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:56.277
      Adam: I paired jordan     
       and viktor together      

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:58.513
       Because they're both     
         strong personas        

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:00.548
        And they both have      
          cannon voices.

       that being different     

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:12.827
         Is actually what       
         made me special.       

01:12:12.863 --> 01:12:14.496
   The world needs              
  a person like you.            

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:16.364

   important person

   an unbelievable experience.

The winner of this battle       
      is jordan.                

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:28.610
   The fact that adam chose me  
       to stay on his team      

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:30.712
    Makes me want to continue   
         to impress him.

     It's so nice               
     to meet you.               

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:40.388

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:41.623
                  You tried     
              to kiss me there. 

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:42.991
        And i really think      
          that her music        

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:44.893
        Has kind of shaped      
         our generation.        

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.194
     What are you gonna sing?   

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:47.395

01:12:48.532 --> 01:12:49.864
           Jordan: Yep.         

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.433
            I would be terrified
              to sing adele...  
Me too.                         

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:53.201
...Unless i was really drunk

There you go.                   

01:12:55.906 --> 01:12:57.806
Adele is a big vocalist,        

01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:00.742
And you have to know            
what you're doing               

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:02.510
To maneuver around a record     
like that.                      

01:13:02.546 --> 01:13:05.680
¶ i let it fall, my heart ¶     

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.982
I chose this song because,      
when i was younger,             

01:13:08.018 --> 01:13:10.118
I did struggle somewhat         
with image issues.              

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:12.487
The message of the song         
kind of talks about the journey,

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:15.023
Then finding yourself again     
in that place of happiness.     

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.858
      Your voice                
   is so beautiful.             

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:17.992
    I want to hear              
     more of it.                

01:13:18.028 --> 01:13:19.861
So, in the beginning,           
when you start singing...       

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:20.862
        ¶ i let it fall ¶

Ooh, ooh, ooh.

You always have time in a vocal 
to tell the whole story.

        This song is deep,      

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:48.156

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:54.822
   Adam -- he's been a longtime 
        favorite of mine.       

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:57.725
    I'm very grateful to work   
   with such a huge superstar.  

01:14:57.761 --> 01:14:59.460
             You have           
     such a beautiful voice.    

01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:00.495
         I'm blown away.        

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:03.097
      The winner                
of this battle...Is viktor.     

01:15:03.133 --> 01:15:04.999
     Viktor: The first thing    
       that came to my mind     

01:15:05.035 --> 01:15:07.201
  Is that, "okay, now i have to 
    make him even more proud."  

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:09.170
  And that's what i'm gonna do. 

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:11.639
      So, what type of song     
    are you gonna sing today?   

01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:13.575
           I picked alicia keys'
           "if i ain't got you."

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.043
            Oh, wow.            
            Yeah. I know, right?

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:17.312
Our band used to cover it.      
  It's a tough song.            

01:15:17.347 --> 01:15:20.748
 Viktor: I didn't know that adam
  has covered this song already.

01:15:20.784 --> 01:15:22.450
       I'm like, "oh, no!"      
           [ chuckles ]         

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:26.454
     So, it's that much more    
  that i have to prove onstage.

             at all ¶

It doesn't sound like           
anybody else's voice.           

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.495
        I love your voice.      

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:36.097
It's really rich and...         

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:37.632
             So cool.           

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:38.933
But it was very behind          
sometimes.                      
          Viktor: Okay.         

01:15:38.969 --> 01:15:40.835
And there's something about     
that song -- it's like...       

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.171
¶ it ain't you, baby ¶          

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:45.740
¶ if i ain't got you,           
  baby ¶                        
 so, like, stay on tempo. Right.

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:47.575
 It, like,                      
 bounces a little more.         

01:15:47.611 --> 01:15:50.011
                 Okay. Okay.    
And you're -- you're changing it
a little bit too much.          

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.346
Stay in the pocket              
of the record.                  

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:52.880
        Rihanna: Exactly.       

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:55.416
     You put an "eh" between    
    every word, instead of...

                           Okay.

If you are gonna convince people
 to love what you do,           

01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:07.862
Then every single note          
    has to be sung              

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.664
With so much conviction         
   that they're --

   but to like it.              

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.234
  Viktor: I'm thinking too much 
          of this song.         

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:16.137
     I'm thinking about what    
   technique i should use there 

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:18.573
   Instead of the real meaning  
            of music,           

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:20.208
   Which is telling the story.

Whoo!                           

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:27.315
And -- and then i think i could 
make a much better performance.

     [ cheers and applause ]    

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.496
      I mean, that was just good
           as it could be.      

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.398
      Thank you. Thank you.     
            You sounded awesome.

01:21:10.433 --> 01:21:11.966
            You hung upside down
            to fix your hair    

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.301
            And then waited     
            till it dried.      

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:14.368
           [ laughter ]         

01:21:14.404 --> 01:21:16.904
                 There's only   
               one thing wrong, 

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.941
       And that's that you're up
            against jordan.     

01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:23.244
       I-i swear i was listening
             to the record.     

01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:25.479
    I mean, that was just one of
        the greatest vocals     

01:21:25.515 --> 01:21:27.348
            I've ever heard live
             in my life, like.  

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:28.349
     [ cheers and applause ]    
thank you. Thank you.           

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:29.450
         Daly: Pharrell.        

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:32.320
        Pharrell: Viktor,       
      i knew you could sing,    

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:34.689
      But to see you, like,     
   clawing away like a tiger -- 

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:36.624
   I thought that was great --  

01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:37.959
           To see you,          
       like, shifting gears     

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:39.527
       And really taking it     
        to the next level.      

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.329
           [ applause ]         

01:21:41.364 --> 01:21:42.330
     And then there's jordan.   

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:43.631
      It's always a pleasure    

01:21:43.666 --> 01:21:46.267
      To see someone sing so    
   eloquently and effortlessly. 

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:48.002
        Both of these guys      
          could continue        

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:50.438
      To take it all the way    
    to the end, in my opinion.  

01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:51.839
          Gwen stefani,         
        what'd you think?       

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:54.775
       Viktor, i was a fan      
   from your last performance.  

01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:57.345
  You are so amazingly talented,

01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.246
       And to be able to go     
     and hithose high notes     

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:00.514
  That were totally unexpected, 

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:02.416
      That was like, "whoa!"    
          like, amazing.        

01:22:02.452 --> 01:22:04.051
                     Thank you. 
        You have it all.        

01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:05.953
      Jordan,                   
      you are a freak of nature.

01:22:05.989 --> 01:22:10.257
        I do not understand     
        how that is possible -- 

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:12.293
        To be able to navigate  
        through that song       

01:22:12.328 --> 01:22:13.561
       And take us on a journey.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.629
        It was emotional        
        and technical,          

01:22:15.665 --> 01:22:17.365
   And it was just mind-blowing.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.532
        Thank you for that.     

01:22:18.568 --> 01:22:19.967
     [ cheers and applause ]    
  thank you.                    

01:22:20.003 --> 01:22:22.937
  Daly: All right, adam, it all 
  comes down to you, buddy.     

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:24.638
Viktor, you were struggling     
with this song a little bit.    

01:22:24.674 --> 01:22:27.008
And i got to tell you,          
the way that you came through   

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:28.943
    Showed me just              
 how amazing you are            

01:22:28.978 --> 01:22:30.978
Because you absolutely          

01:22:31.014 --> 01:22:34.148
Tackled every single thing      
  that we went over.            

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:36.717
You did not get rattled.        
 You did your thing.            

01:22:36.753 --> 01:22:38.786
                  Thank you.    

01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:44.825
   Jordan, we refer             
to you affectionately           

01:22:44.861 --> 01:22:45.826
 As "the unicorn"...            

01:22:45.862 --> 01:22:47.495
            [ laughs ]          

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:49.697
...Because i think it's         
a profound experience           

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:51.232
     For someone                
  to hear you sing.             

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:52.666
    And the hairs               
     on your arms               

01:22:52.702 --> 01:22:55.636
And the goose bumps just stand  
up all at the same time.        

01:22:55.671 --> 01:22:57.438
    I-i don't know              
if there's any person           

01:22:57.473 --> 01:23:00.141
That's ever affected me         
      like that.                

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:01.675
It's unbelievable.

        of this knockout?

 this decision suck.

           [ laughter ]         

01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:15.556
   There are about              
  a hundred reasons             

01:23:15.591 --> 01:23:17.158
   To go with both              
     of you guys.               

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:19.960

 of this knockout...

    ...Is jordan.

         of the knockout.

      to the live playoffs.

        to [laughing] cry.

     your attention so much,
