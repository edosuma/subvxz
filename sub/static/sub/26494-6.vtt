WEBVTT

00:03.151 --> 00:05.819
What just happened?

00:05.821 --> 00:07.454
This is the end...

00:07.456 --> 00:08.822
of everything.

00:12.561 --> 00:14.794
We had a deal!

00:14.796 --> 00:16.329
Michael.

00:17.799 --> 00:20.400
Thanks for the suit.

00:20.402 --> 00:22.335
I'm useless.

00:24.539 --> 00:26.773
Charlie?

00:30.112 --> 00:31.644
<i>She</i> wasn't cursed.

00:31.646 --> 00:33.546
<i>This</i> was.

00:36.451 --> 00:39.752
You have
the mind of a Hunter.

00:39.754 --> 00:41.821
I don't remember most
of what Michael did.

00:41.823 --> 00:42.856
No! Ugh!

00:42.858 --> 00:44.824
And now
he's hurting people.

00:49.331 --> 00:51.397
It's all on me.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.366
It's my fault.

01:11.319 --> 01:13.686
Good morning!

01:55.830 --> 01:57.797
Whoa, whoa, Harper,
it's me.

01:57.799 --> 01:59.065
Winston, God.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.568
I'm sorry, I just, uh --
just wanted to make sure

02:01.570 --> 02:04.938
that we're still on for,
you know, dinner tonight.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.373
Um...

02:07.375 --> 02:08.574
yeah, sure.

02:08.577 --> 02:10.443
Harper.

02:10.445 --> 02:12.612
Are you okay?
I heard a scream.

02:12.614 --> 02:14.080
Is this guy
causing trouble?

02:14.082 --> 02:17.050
"This guy"? Miles, we went
to high school together.

02:17.052 --> 02:19.572
Miles, we talked about you minding
your own business, didn't we?

02:21.056 --> 02:23.556
Put the stapler down.

02:26.828 --> 02:28.928
I heard a scream.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.036
Guy's always
been creepy.

02:37.038 --> 02:39.939
He's just overreacting because
nothing ever happens here.

02:39.941 --> 02:42.709
Nobody comes
to the library anymore,

02:42.711 --> 02:45.044
not even
for story time.

02:45.046 --> 02:46.446
Isn't that sad?

02:47.882 --> 02:49.749
Well,
I'm here.

02:49.751 --> 02:51.384
I'll see you tonight.

02:51.386 --> 02:53.119
- For our date.
- For dinner.

02:53.121 --> 02:55.755
Which I'm sure will be
a very nice time.

03:45.907 --> 03:47.173
Geez.

03:47.175 --> 03:48.608
What's up
with the sugar?

03:48.610 --> 03:51.377
Well, without my powers,
everything tastes different.

03:51.379 --> 03:53.780
So, I can't get this
how I like it.

03:53.782 --> 03:54.947
Seen Sam?

03:54.949 --> 03:56.449
He went to meet up
with Charlie.

03:56.451 --> 03:58.985
You were on an overnight run
to Mary and Bobby's place.

03:58.987 --> 04:00.887
He said
it couldn't wait.

04:00.889 --> 04:04.490
They're probably doing something
really exciting.

04:17.137 --> 04:22.141
So, this is where
all those people went missing?

04:22.142 --> 04:24.877
Yep.

04:26.348 --> 04:28.715
Right.

04:30.018 --> 04:33.586
So, he just
left you here, huh?

04:33.588 --> 04:34.887
Yep.

04:34.889 --> 04:37.623
Sam wanted someone around
when you came back.

04:39.094 --> 04:41.094
He's worried about you.

04:41.096 --> 04:43.529
Yeah,
sounds like him.

04:43.531 --> 04:47.233
Dean, what happened
with Michael --

04:47.235 --> 04:49.335
no one blames you.

04:49.337 --> 04:51.070
Cool.

04:51.072 --> 04:53.873
Well, I blame me,
so...

04:58.980 --> 05:01.748
Still with that cough,
huh?

05:01.750 --> 05:05.585
Yeah, maybe I'm allergic
to sitting around doing nothing.

05:06.521 --> 05:08.821
All right.

05:08.823 --> 05:11.190
What do you want
to do?

05:11.192 --> 05:12.658
Hunt.

05:13.495 --> 05:15.027
Sam says
I can't go alone,

05:15.029 --> 05:17.797
but Cass and I,
we've been working cases.

05:17.799 --> 05:21.000
And he says you've been
doing good on those.

05:21.002 --> 05:22.335
No offense --

05:22.337 --> 05:24.904
Cass is an insurance policy
on those hunts.

05:27.342 --> 05:30.576
Sam's just trying
to keep you safe, okay?

05:30.578 --> 05:32.345
He's a smart guy.

05:36.985 --> 05:40.119
Hmm.

05:43.725 --> 05:46.125
Look.
Winston Mathers.

05:46.127 --> 05:47.860
Dead,
with what appears to be

05:47.862 --> 05:49.829
human bite marks
taken out of the corpse.

05:49.831 --> 05:51.197
"Human" bite marks?

05:51.199 --> 05:54.400
And other people
have gone missing, too.

05:55.470 --> 05:58.604
Well, Sam's not
gonna like it.

05:58.606 --> 06:00.573
Sam's not here.

06:01.643 --> 06:04.710
Okay, you know what?
You did good work. Okay?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.446
- I'll go check it out.
- No.

06:06.448 --> 06:08.815
We're supposed to have a partner
for all hunts now, right?

06:08.817 --> 06:11.217
We can be
hunting buddies.

06:11.219 --> 06:12.552
Okay. Uh...

06:12.554 --> 06:14.654
"A" --
don't call it that.

06:14.656 --> 06:17.323
And "B" --
you're gonna back me up?

06:17.325 --> 06:19.692
Dean,
I need to do something.

06:19.694 --> 06:21.461
You don't understand.

06:22.397 --> 06:24.964
I could have
killed Michael.

06:26.134 --> 06:28.434
Here,
when I was strong enough,

06:28.436 --> 06:29.936
I could have.

06:29.938 --> 06:32.772
But there was
so much going on,

06:32.774 --> 06:34.874
and then
everything else happened

06:34.876 --> 06:37.743
because I was distracted
and stupid and --

06:37.745 --> 06:38.978
Hey.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.847
You didn't
do anything wrong.

06:40.849 --> 06:42.081
And neither did you.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.983
But that doesn't make it
any easier, does it?

06:43.985 --> 06:45.952
So, I can't just sit here
in the bunker

06:45.954 --> 06:47.253
thinking about it
all day.

06:47.255 --> 06:48.588
What I could have
done differently,

06:48.590 --> 06:50.256
how I can't do
anything about it now.

06:50.258 --> 06:51.557
But I can do this.

06:51.559 --> 06:53.359
I can hunt.

06:54.729 --> 06:56.496
Give me a chance.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.034
Are you sure?
Just you guys?

07:02.036 --> 07:04.036
I mean, we can probably send
some other hunters out there.

07:04.038 --> 07:05.805
It's so close and --

07:05.807 --> 07:08.374
Yeah.
Be careful.

07:12.146 --> 07:15.448
Dean's going out on a hunt
with Jack.

07:15.450 --> 07:18.784
Good for them.

07:20.188 --> 07:22.555
Are you sure
this is the right place?

07:22.557 --> 07:25.291
Well, it's where
those four people disappeared,

07:25.293 --> 07:27.293
and when
I was scouting around,

07:27.295 --> 07:29.228
I found this.

07:30.465 --> 07:32.532
- What, goo?
- Goo.

07:32.534 --> 07:35.368
So, yeah, I'd say
this is the right place.

07:35.370 --> 07:36.669
Now I'm just trying
to figure out

07:36.671 --> 07:38.104
what we're dealing with.

07:38.106 --> 07:40.273
Thus, books.

07:46.147 --> 07:48.915
♪ Ever since
she came to town... ♪

07:48.917 --> 07:53.052
This was Winston's
favorite spot?

07:53.054 --> 07:54.453
His obituary said

07:54.455 --> 07:55.788
he loved having breakfast here
every morning,

07:55.790 --> 07:57.957
which is sort of
oddly specific.

07:57.959 --> 07:59.792
Yeah,
when a young guy dies,

07:59.794 --> 08:02.128
they never know
what to put in those things.

08:03.765 --> 08:05.398
Hi, there.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.066
- Help you?
- Yeah.

08:07.068 --> 08:09.068
Uh, Agent Berry,
FBI.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.803
This is my partner,
Agent Charles.

08:10.805 --> 08:12.572
Wondering if you can give
us some details

08:12.574 --> 08:14.941
on a regular of yours,
Winston Mathers?

08:14.943 --> 08:16.242
Sure, hon.

08:16.244 --> 08:18.644
Um,
detail number one --

08:18.646 --> 08:20.379
Winston's dead.

08:20.381 --> 08:22.481
Detail number two --

08:22.483 --> 08:25.051
huh,
that's all the details.

08:25.053 --> 08:28.087
Winston dead.

08:28.089 --> 08:29.322
No details.

08:29.324 --> 08:32.457
Uh, you know,
you're gonna want to be

08:32.460 --> 08:34.025
a little more helpful
than that.

08:34.028 --> 08:35.861
Listen,
Deep State.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.597
Flashing a badge
might work on people

08:37.599 --> 08:39.865
who don't have a working
knowledge of the Constitution...

08:39.866 --> 08:42.001
...but that ain't me.

08:42.003 --> 08:44.403
Now I got to go
earn some money.

08:44.405 --> 08:47.506
Or you could stay here
and earn some money.

08:56.150 --> 08:59.952
He, uh, came in every day
like clockwork.

08:59.954 --> 09:04.323
But you <i>really</i> want to ask about
Harper Sayles.

09:04.325 --> 09:06.125
Winston just started
courting her.

09:06.127 --> 09:07.460
What's "courting?"

09:07.462 --> 09:09.495
It's what you do
before you start dating.

09:09.497 --> 09:12.131
Oh, and that's the thing you do
before the sex.

09:15.436 --> 09:19.005
Sometimes you just
have the sex.

09:20.108 --> 09:21.807
Okay, that's...

09:23.044 --> 09:25.311
Who is Harper Sayles?

09:25.313 --> 09:27.913
Harper's
a really sweet woman.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.248
Everybody in town knows her.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.516
It's been a sad life.

09:30.518 --> 09:31.951
Prom queen in high school.

09:31.953 --> 09:33.419
Very popular.

09:33.421 --> 09:35.121
And her boyfriend
ran off on her.

09:35.123 --> 09:37.056
She did not take it well.

09:37.058 --> 09:38.858
- Ever since then, well...
- Everything just seems to go wrong.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.860
She's lost people --
Not people. Men.

09:40.862 --> 09:42.194
- Men.
- Men.

09:42.196 --> 09:43.896
- A lawyer.
- A florist.

09:43.898 --> 09:46.065
- A gym coach.
- Now Winston.

09:46.067 --> 09:49.168
It just honestly seems like all
she cares about are her books.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.936
Romance novels,
mostly.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.138
Heroes and damsels.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.040
- Ask me?
- She's bad luck.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.741
- She's bad luck.
- She's bad luck.

09:55.743 --> 09:57.443
- Real shame.
- Real shame.

10:05.153 --> 10:07.019
He'll be fine.

10:07.021 --> 10:09.288
Your brother,
I mean.

10:09.290 --> 10:11.223
He's got
other friends, right?

10:11.225 --> 10:12.525
Funny.

10:12.527 --> 10:15.594
Um, he used to have
a pretty damn good wing man.

10:15.596 --> 10:19.065
So, call that guy
to check on him.

10:19.067 --> 10:21.834
That "guy" was you.

10:23.204 --> 10:25.504
No,
it wasn't.

10:25.506 --> 10:28.874
Right. I -- Sorry.
I didn't mean to...

10:28.876 --> 10:30.509
I'm just saying,

10:30.511 --> 10:33.379
I'm not surprised
you survived the apocalypse.

10:33.381 --> 10:34.647
Yeah.

10:34.649 --> 10:36.916
Well, <i>I</i> am.

10:38.853 --> 10:40.886
Sam,
before all this,

10:40.888 --> 10:44.223
I was just a programmer
at Richard Roman Enterprises.

10:44.225 --> 10:47.059
I lived with
the love of my life, and we --

10:47.061 --> 10:49.729
Wait, you -- you did?

10:49.731 --> 10:51.931
Yeah.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.701
So, your Charlie,
she --

10:58.539 --> 11:01.974
I guess
she never met Kara.

11:01.976 --> 11:04.443
Kara.

11:05.747 --> 11:06.946
Uh...

11:06.948 --> 11:09.181
she owned a bakery
outside of Chicago.

11:09.183 --> 11:10.483
Cupcakes.

11:10.485 --> 11:12.985
It was like something
out of a storybook.

11:12.987 --> 11:15.521
She always
smelled like peaches,

11:15.523 --> 11:18.257
and her smile
was just...

11:24.999 --> 11:29.401
Michael and Lucifer,
when they started their war,

11:29.403 --> 11:33.072
first thing,
a giant EMP or something like it

11:33.074 --> 11:35.107
went off
over North America.

11:35.109 --> 11:37.243
Fried every bit
of technology.

11:37.245 --> 11:40.412
Cellphones,
power plants.

11:40.414 --> 11:44.416
For the first few days,
we banded together.

11:44.418 --> 11:48.754
Thought,
"Hey, someone'll save us".

11:48.756 --> 11:51.190
No one ever did.

11:55.496 --> 12:00.099
When the food ran out,
people got mean.

12:00.101 --> 12:02.401
Mobs started forming,

12:02.403 --> 12:07.306
stealing whatever they could
get their hands on.

12:07.308 --> 12:09.809
A lot of people died.

12:11.479 --> 12:14.213
Kara died.

12:18.319 --> 12:21.587
People are always the same
when things go wrong --

12:21.589 --> 12:24.123
they lose it.

12:24.125 --> 12:26.258
One day,
the water gets shut off,

12:26.260 --> 12:30.496
the next day,
people are on fire.

12:30.498 --> 12:36.368
It's a fact
about society --

12:36.370 --> 12:39.438
it all falls apart.

12:50.251 --> 12:53.619
Not here.

12:53.621 --> 12:57.056
Not yet.

12:58.893 --> 13:01.427
Well, congrats, Mighty Mouse.

13:01.429 --> 13:02.995
I think
you found us a case.

13:02.997 --> 13:05.231
Thanks.
What's Mighty Mouse?

13:05.233 --> 13:07.333
Eat up.

13:07.335 --> 13:08.934
Pie's important.

13:08.936 --> 13:10.803
Okay, uh,
can I ask you about

13:10.805 --> 13:12.705
what Wanda said
about courting?

13:12.707 --> 13:14.707
I mean,
I've seen romantic movies,

13:14.709 --> 13:16.141
but I've never
experienced it.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.277
Unless what you said about
Rowena and Gabriel counts.

13:18.279 --> 13:19.945
No,
definitely doesn't count.

13:19.947 --> 13:21.981
Look, I promise
when we get back home,

13:21.983 --> 13:24.250
I'll give you
the talk, okay?

13:24.252 --> 13:25.718
The talk?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.086
Mm-hmm.

13:27.088 --> 13:28.621
Right now what we got to find
is Harper Sayles.

13:28.623 --> 13:31.190
I mean, that's just too much
bad luck for one person.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.562
Maybe --
Maybe she's not human.

13:36.564 --> 13:38.797
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

13:38.799 --> 13:40.900
How?

13:40.902 --> 13:43.335
You ever read
a romance novel?

13:50.211 --> 13:51.777
Harper Sayles?

13:51.779 --> 13:54.346
Hi!
Um, how can I help you?

13:54.348 --> 13:55.915
Uh, FBI.

13:55.917 --> 14:00.052
Got some questions
about Winston Mathers.

14:00.054 --> 14:02.621
Oh, I already spoke
to the police.

14:02.623 --> 14:04.456
Well,
I'm not the police.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.058
I don't -- I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

14:06.060 --> 14:07.793
Well, I'm gonna <i>need</i> you
to talk about it.

14:10.097 --> 14:11.730
Hello.

14:11.732 --> 14:13.933
Sorry to interrupt.

14:13.935 --> 14:16.335
I'm looking for the best book
on the area's history.

14:16.337 --> 14:18.504
Excuse me.
<i>I</i> was talking with her.

14:18.506 --> 14:19.805
Really?

14:19.807 --> 14:21.941
Because it doesn't look like
she wants to talk to you.

14:24.478 --> 14:27.279
- Listen, I'm, uh --
- FBI.

14:27.281 --> 14:28.480
Yeah,
I heard.

14:28.482 --> 14:30.082
But, see,
I haven't done anything wrong,

14:30.084 --> 14:31.550
so you can't
do anything to me.

14:31.552 --> 14:33.485
And if she doesn't want
to talk to you,

14:33.487 --> 14:34.787
you can't make her.

14:34.789 --> 14:36.789
Not without
arresting her.

14:36.791 --> 14:37.957
But you're FBI,

14:37.959 --> 14:39.391
so you probably
knew that already.

14:39.393 --> 14:41.093
Okay.

14:41.095 --> 14:44.163
Why don't you back off,
kid?

14:44.165 --> 14:45.864
No,
you back off...

14:45.866 --> 14:47.132
old man.

14:47.134 --> 14:48.901
Uh --

14:50.571 --> 14:52.438
Old man?

14:52.440 --> 14:55.374
Yeah.
That's right.

14:59.613 --> 15:02.314
Okay.
All right.

15:02.316 --> 15:04.583
This isn't over.

15:08.089 --> 15:10.889
That was
so chivalrous.

15:10.891 --> 15:11.991
Yeah.

15:11.993 --> 15:14.159
What's his problem?

15:14.161 --> 15:16.895
He was just asking --

15:18.132 --> 15:20.499
Y-You know what?
It's fine, I'm fine.

15:20.501 --> 15:22.301
Thank you
for stepping in.

15:22.303 --> 15:23.736
You didn't
have to do that.

15:23.738 --> 15:25.604
I'm Jack,
by the way.

15:25.606 --> 15:27.673
Jack Smith.

15:27.675 --> 15:29.208
Harper.

15:30.945 --> 15:33.812
I have
the perfect book for you.

15:33.814 --> 15:35.381
That would be great.

15:39.787 --> 15:42.488
Old man, my ass.

15:45.826 --> 15:48.160
Harper.

15:48.162 --> 15:49.862
Are you leaving?

15:49.864 --> 15:51.764
Miles,
this is Jack.

15:51.766 --> 15:53.766
He's visiting, and I'm getting
him my favorite book about town.

15:53.768 --> 15:55.000
It's just
down at my apartment,

15:55.002 --> 15:56.335
but, um, I'll come back
and lock up.

15:56.337 --> 15:58.404
You're taking him
to your apartment?

15:58.406 --> 15:59.805
You don't even
know this guy.

15:59.807 --> 16:02.441
Miles, stop it.
Let's go.

16:06.914 --> 16:10.616
All right,
where are we headed?

17:05.766 --> 17:08.467
How many books
are you reading?

17:08.469 --> 17:09.868
All of them.

17:09.871 --> 17:12.471
I hate hunting.

17:12.473 --> 17:13.873
Really?

17:13.875 --> 17:15.107
'Cause I got to say,

17:15.108 --> 17:16.775
you're kind of awesome
at it.

17:16.777 --> 17:19.778
Yeah, well, when it's that
or die by angel kill squad...

17:19.780 --> 17:21.046
Right.

17:21.048 --> 17:22.248
I mean,
no offense,

17:22.250 --> 17:23.749
but who wants
to be a hunter?

17:23.751 --> 17:27.619
This job, it's just
a lot of tears and death.

17:27.622 --> 17:29.922
Funny.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.858
You, uh -- You said
something like that to me once

17:32.860 --> 17:35.027
long ago about hunting.
Not you.

17:35.029 --> 17:36.896
Uh, sorry.

17:36.898 --> 17:38.664
Our Charlie.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.166
Well,
she was right.

17:41.168 --> 17:44.003
So glad
this is my last case.

17:44.005 --> 17:45.271
What?

17:45.273 --> 17:47.973
I told myself I'd help you out
for awhile,

17:47.975 --> 17:50.242
at least until everyone
got really settled,

17:50.244 --> 17:52.478
and then...
- I'm out.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.281
- To do what? To go where?
- Away.

17:55.283 --> 17:59.618
From monsters,
from people, from...

17:59.620 --> 18:02.187
I'll go live on a mountaintop
or something.

18:02.189 --> 18:04.356
As long
as there's good Wi-Fi.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.967
Come in.

18:18.773 --> 18:21.607
Okay,
I'm just realizing

18:21.609 --> 18:24.109
it's weird
I brought you to my place.

18:24.111 --> 18:25.811
That's weird.
I'm weird.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.047
It's fine.
I think.

18:28.049 --> 18:30.583
You need to get
that book, right?

18:30.585 --> 18:32.451
I just don't want you
to think I'm --

18:32.453 --> 18:34.720
I'm not putting
the moves on you.

18:34.722 --> 18:38.991
- The moves?
- I'll go get the book.

18:43.764 --> 18:46.131
Hey, uh,
do you mind --

18:46.133 --> 18:49.234
Is it okay
to ask you about the guy

18:49.236 --> 18:50.803
who was hassling you
at the library?

18:50.805 --> 18:53.439
Oh, recently,
a boy I knew --

18:53.441 --> 18:56.308
or was starting to know --
passed away.

18:56.310 --> 18:57.977
It was terrible.

18:57.979 --> 19:00.079
The authorities have been asking
a lot of questions,

19:00.081 --> 19:01.580
but I don't
know anything,

19:01.582 --> 19:03.682
and I'm a pretty private person,
so...

19:04.986 --> 19:06.719
It's been
a little difficult.

19:06.721 --> 19:09.922
- That's awful about your friend.
- Thanks.

19:12.126 --> 19:13.592
Is this yours?

19:13.594 --> 19:17.763
Oh, sorry.
I must've dropped that.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.633
Your hand is wet.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.535
<i>Christo.</i>

19:23.537 --> 19:26.538
Did you say something?

19:26.540 --> 19:27.806
Uh, no.

19:27.808 --> 19:29.174
Uh...

19:29.176 --> 19:31.210
I'm just nervous.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.912
Come here.

19:38.686 --> 19:40.586
Got something.

19:40.588 --> 19:41.687
What?

19:41.689 --> 19:43.222
Have you ever
heard of a Musca?

19:43.224 --> 19:45.357
Yeah, like a hybrid
between a man and a fly.

19:45.359 --> 19:46.792
A lot of stories
about them,

19:46.794 --> 19:48.560
but no one's ever seen one
in real life.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.529
If they do exist,
they keep to themselves.

19:50.531 --> 19:52.097
Look at you.

19:52.099 --> 19:54.066
Oh, I have read
all the books.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.202
Nerd.
But check this.

19:57.204 --> 20:00.305
Every few hundred years,
there's a "bad egg".

20:00.307 --> 20:02.074
When a male
fails to find a mate,

20:02.076 --> 20:04.343
he abandons
his community

20:04.345 --> 20:06.712
and starts using people's bodies
to nest,

20:06.714 --> 20:10.315
binding them together
with a viscous goo.

20:10.317 --> 20:14.053
- And when the goo fits...
- Oh, great.

20:14.055 --> 20:18.290
Our perp might just be a giant
fly with low self-esteem.

20:20.061 --> 20:21.760
- Sam.
- Yeah?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.262
What is that?

20:48.022 --> 20:51.457
So,
where are you from?

20:51.459 --> 20:56.161
I'm from a little town in Kansas
called Lebanon.

20:56.163 --> 20:58.864
It's actually smaller
than this one.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.165
Wow.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.434
Yeah, my family's been here
for generations.

21:02.436 --> 21:03.902
I'm the last one.

21:07.174 --> 21:09.775
Are you okay?

21:12.346 --> 21:15.280
Is this --
Is this your boyfriend?

21:16.217 --> 21:19.118
I'm single.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.385
Perpetually.

21:20.387 --> 21:22.755
But Vance
was my boyfriend.

21:22.757 --> 21:25.557
After high school,
he wanted to leave town.

21:25.559 --> 21:27.559
I told him
we didn't need to.

21:27.561 --> 21:29.528
We could see the world
in books.

21:29.530 --> 21:33.899
Which I know
sounds way too sappy.

21:33.901 --> 21:37.402
And...
he left anyway.

21:37.404 --> 21:39.772
Without <i>you?</i>

21:44.512 --> 21:47.479
I don't blame him.

21:47.481 --> 21:50.215
But that, well...

21:50.217 --> 21:54.019
that was the beginning
of my bad luck.

21:54.021 --> 21:57.489
Just so many things
that I --

21:58.659 --> 22:01.860
I try
to stay optimistic.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.328
Me, too.

22:03.330 --> 22:05.597
I've had some...

22:05.599 --> 22:10.602
not-so-great stuff
happen in my past.

22:12.072 --> 22:15.174
Trying to be positive...

22:15.176 --> 22:17.342
it can be hard.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.223
Jack?

22:33.627 --> 22:37.763
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

22:37.765 --> 22:40.999
Do you...

22:43.703 --> 22:45.603
...mind if I use
the bathroom?

22:54.712 --> 22:56.178
Jack.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.346
Uh, Dean?

22:57.348 --> 22:59.815
Um,
I'm at Harper's place.

22:59.817 --> 23:02.151
The silver and the holy water
didn't do anything,

23:02.153 --> 23:03.619
so she's not
a demon.

23:03.621 --> 23:04.987
Where are you?

23:04.989 --> 23:07.450
Because Harper is not
a monster,

23:07.451 --> 23:09.585
and I'm 99% sure
she's in love with me.

23:09.587 --> 23:11.119
That's not
how it works, kid.

23:11.121 --> 23:14.056
Okay, but she was looking at me
with these googly eyes,

23:14.058 --> 23:15.457
and then
she asked me --

23:15.459 --> 23:16.992
Look, I promise you
that Harper Sayles

23:16.994 --> 23:18.827
is not in love with you, okay?
Would you calm down?

23:18.829 --> 23:20.195
Okay.

23:20.197 --> 23:22.497
But if she is, I need to know
everything about sex. Go.

23:22.499 --> 23:23.732
Jack,
listen to me.

23:23.734 --> 23:25.701
The guy that she works with
is dead,

23:25.703 --> 23:27.669
and I mean
fresh dead.

23:27.671 --> 23:29.338
Something bit out
his throat.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.573
So, we got bigger things
to worry about right now.

23:31.575 --> 23:32.908
Okay,
what should I do?

23:32.910 --> 23:34.576
Well, something's definitely
stalking Harper,

23:34.578 --> 23:36.144
or at least the people
around her.

23:36.146 --> 23:39.648
She said that she had bad luck.
Maybe she's cursed.

23:39.650 --> 23:42.184
Well, seems like
the guys around her are cursed.

23:42.186 --> 23:44.720
Okay,
guys like me?

23:44.722 --> 23:46.622
Yeah.
Look, just keep her there --

23:47.891 --> 23:50.726
Dean?

23:50.728 --> 23:52.160
Dean?

24:00.471 --> 24:02.504
- Are you upset?
- What?

24:02.506 --> 24:04.072
Ugh, I freaked you out,
didn't I?

24:04.074 --> 24:06.608
I'm sorry. Sometimes I can
come off as intense.

24:06.610 --> 24:09.411
No, you're fine.

24:09.413 --> 24:11.546
<i>I'm</i> fine.

24:11.548 --> 24:12.681
So...

24:12.683 --> 24:16.151
do you want to go get coffee,
or...?

24:16.153 --> 24:17.519
I don't know.

24:17.521 --> 24:19.321
You don't know?

24:22.893 --> 24:24.860
No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

24:24.862 --> 24:27.062
We're here to help you.

24:27.064 --> 24:28.330
I'm Dean,
okay?

24:28.332 --> 24:30.465
I work with Jack.
We're not FBI.

24:30.467 --> 24:32.834
We're here to save lives --
maybe even yours.

24:32.836 --> 24:34.269
Save me?
From what?

24:34.271 --> 24:36.772
That.

24:46.732 --> 24:48.833
- Who's out there?
- It's not a "who".

24:48.835 --> 24:50.568
At first,
I thought it was a ghost,

24:50.570 --> 24:52.137
but then it punched me in the face.
- A ghost?

24:52.139 --> 24:54.439
No, he's saying
it's <i>not</i> a ghost.

24:56.143 --> 24:58.109
Yeah, now I'm thinking,
uh --

24:58.111 --> 25:00.178
- Who is this?
- That's my old boyfriend Vance.

25:00.180 --> 25:03.414
- How did he die?
- Die? I think he lives in Connecticut.

25:03.416 --> 25:05.550
- Not anymore.
- Harper!

25:05.552 --> 25:07.852
Vance?!
- Vance?

25:07.854 --> 25:09.154
Vance.

25:09.156 --> 25:10.922
All right, so we're dealing with
some sort of undead,

25:10.924 --> 25:13.491
risen dead --
something in that wheelhouse.

25:13.493 --> 25:15.026
Harper!
Silver. Silver.

25:15.028 --> 25:16.528
Risen dead?

25:16.530 --> 25:18.530
- Yeah.
- Harper!

25:18.532 --> 25:20.732
Looks like you
finally get your zombie, kid.

25:20.734 --> 25:23.001
- Zombie?!
- Oh, he means --

25:23.003 --> 25:24.569
Silver can hurt it,
maybe slow it down,

25:24.571 --> 25:28.473
but there is only one way
to stop these things.

25:38.618 --> 25:40.618
- Jack, get her out of here.
- I-I can't just leave.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.287
Go, now!

25:46.092 --> 25:48.660
Archie! Hey!

25:48.662 --> 25:50.461
Let's dance.

26:08.982 --> 26:10.215
Charlie,
you can't just quit

26:10.217 --> 26:11.649
and go live on
a mountain somewhere.

26:14.387 --> 26:16.721
- People need people.
- Why?

26:16.723 --> 26:18.189
'Cause they're the luckiest
people in the world?

26:18.191 --> 26:19.324
No, come on.

26:19.326 --> 26:21.492
We just do.
We're social animals.

26:21.494 --> 26:24.095
- Emphasis on "animals".
- Yeah, but you're also a hunter.

26:24.097 --> 26:25.730
The things
that we've seen,

26:25.732 --> 26:27.732
it's not so easy
to just walk away from it all.

26:27.734 --> 26:30.134
Believe me, I've tried.
<i>Our</i> Charlie tried.

26:30.136 --> 26:32.670
Yeah, well, again,
she ain't me.

26:34.574 --> 26:36.207
It's <i>my</i> life,
Sam.

26:36.209 --> 26:38.476
Not <i>hers</i>
and not <i>yours.</i>

26:40.180 --> 26:42.747
He's back.

26:45.218 --> 26:47.752
That's got to be
our guy, right?

26:47.754 --> 26:48.853
- I say we rush him.
- No, no, no.

26:48.855 --> 26:50.255
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

26:50.257 --> 26:51.756
We don't want to run up
and tackle some regular guy

26:51.758 --> 26:53.291
just 'cause he's into
weird fashion.

26:53.293 --> 26:54.826
Mm, don't we?

27:00.667 --> 27:04.102
Come on.

27:13.847 --> 27:16.114
Damn it!
Go, go, go, go!

27:18.685 --> 27:20.585
Wait!
W-What is happening?

27:20.587 --> 27:24.222
No, look -- Look, we have to
keep moving.

27:34.301 --> 27:36.200
Hyah!

27:41.174 --> 27:43.074
What the hell?

27:50.150 --> 27:53.284
You were gonna come back
and lock up, remember?

27:53.286 --> 27:55.386
No. Apparently,
my dead high-school boyfriend

27:55.388 --> 27:57.121
attacked us,
and I forgot.

28:09.035 --> 28:11.602
Where'd they go?

28:14.074 --> 28:16.007
Not a lot of options.

28:16.009 --> 28:17.141
Look at this.

28:17.143 --> 28:19.177
I cased
this block earlier.

28:19.179 --> 28:20.478
That was
definitely locked...

28:20.480 --> 28:22.447
and, you know,
not covered in goo.

28:22.449 --> 28:25.216
You said there was something
in the book about, uh, uh,

28:25.218 --> 28:27.618
a brass nail dipped
in sugar water can kill it?

28:27.620 --> 28:30.722
In theory, since no one's
actually seen one.

28:30.724 --> 28:33.925
And we have exactly zero
of those items handy, so...

28:33.927 --> 28:35.927
So,
we get creative.

28:45.305 --> 28:48.740
Ugh.

28:48.742 --> 28:50.875
Oh, God.
That is, uh...

28:50.877 --> 28:54.245
Yeah, smells like pine cleaner
and rotting meat.

30:04.050 --> 30:05.883
Sam?

30:07.787 --> 30:11.155
Yeah, he was chloroformed,
all right.

30:13.927 --> 30:15.193
I found him.

30:17.197 --> 30:19.464
He's still alive.

30:19.466 --> 30:21.632
We should
get him out of here.

30:23.503 --> 30:26.471
- Charlie?
- Sam!

30:33.780 --> 30:36.380
Charlie!

30:40.320 --> 30:42.987
Hey, hey, Charlie.

30:42.989 --> 30:45.189
Charlie!

31:16.956 --> 31:21.659
So...
we got creative.

31:21.661 --> 31:24.462
Cool.

31:35.997 --> 31:38.064
Don't worry.

31:38.066 --> 31:39.332
I locked it.

31:39.334 --> 31:41.100
Did you flip the switch
under the lock?

31:41.102 --> 31:43.069
What -- What switch?

31:43.071 --> 31:44.303
I'll get it.

31:44.305 --> 31:46.639
Harper, don't!
Don't!

32:11.766 --> 32:13.432
Harper?

32:14.903 --> 32:17.069
Aww, sweet.

32:18.773 --> 32:22.475
No, no.

32:22.477 --> 32:24.443
What are you doing?

32:24.445 --> 32:27.880
What?
He's my boyfriend.

32:27.882 --> 32:31.017
He just gets
a little jealous sometimes.

32:31.019 --> 32:32.618
But he's dead.

32:32.620 --> 32:34.353
And stalking you.

32:34.355 --> 32:35.821
No,
he's stalking <i>you.</i>

32:35.823 --> 32:37.957
It's a little game
we play.

32:37.959 --> 32:39.725
Some people
pretend to be naughty nurses,

32:39.727 --> 32:41.861
some people get tied up.
We do this.

32:41.863 --> 32:44.764
Oh, and he has to eat flesh
to maintain his body.

32:44.766 --> 32:47.266
Stupid magic.

32:47.268 --> 32:49.402
But it all
works out.

32:49.404 --> 32:50.937
Except...

32:50.939 --> 32:52.805
not for you.

33:08.189 --> 33:09.822
I'm sorry about all this,
Jack.

33:09.824 --> 33:11.127
<i>I actually think I liked you.</i>

33:11.128 --> 33:13.028
<i>But you're obviously a hunter,</i>

33:13.030 --> 33:15.497
<i>and I come from a long line</i>
<i>of necromancers.</i>

33:15.499 --> 33:18.233
I mean, I can mostly
only raise the dead,

33:18.235 --> 33:19.634
but that comes in handy.

33:19.636 --> 33:21.703
And I can't let you
or your friend

33:21.705 --> 33:25.107
get in the way
of the love Vance and I share.

33:25.109 --> 33:27.075
<i>It's first love, Jack.</i>

33:27.077 --> 33:28.443
<i>The best kind.</i>

33:28.445 --> 33:30.846
<i>Without baggage or compromise.</i>

33:30.848 --> 33:34.516
I mean, I did have to kill him
to keep him here after college,

33:34.518 --> 33:37.285
<i>but...every relationship</i>
<i>has its stuff, right?</i>

33:37.287 --> 33:40.555
<i>And all the other guys --</i>
<i>none of them are like Vance.</i>

33:40.557 --> 33:43.692
<i>Strong and courageous and --</i>

33:43.694 --> 33:45.994
<i>So, they all had to die.</i>

33:45.996 --> 33:48.897
Especially Miles,
who just -- ugh.

33:48.899 --> 33:51.867
<i>So, I had Vance</i>
<i>crush his throat.</i>

33:51.869 --> 33:54.669
I wish I could have watched.

33:55.839 --> 33:57.906
<i>And now</i>
<i>we're going to kill</i> you.

34:23.801 --> 34:26.134
Shh.

34:26.136 --> 34:27.235
Okay.

34:27.237 --> 34:28.904
Not a lot works
on these things.

34:28.906 --> 34:31.639
Uh, headshot?

34:31.641 --> 34:33.041
No, no, no.

34:33.043 --> 34:34.909
Creeps like this, you got to
get 'em back in their grave.

34:34.911 --> 34:35.866
Drive a silver stake through
their heart to keep 'em there.

34:35.889 --> 34:37.246
Okay, so...?

34:37.246 --> 34:40.148
So, we got to convince this guy
to get six feet under.

34:40.150 --> 34:43.952
And you're gonna convince him
with your shotgun?

34:43.954 --> 34:45.587
Not exactly.

34:47.324 --> 34:49.357
Harper?

34:49.359 --> 34:51.525
Why are you
doing this?

34:51.527 --> 34:55.397
I-I thought we fell in love
at first sight.

34:55.399 --> 34:56.630
What?

34:56.632 --> 34:59.501
I'm not weak
like those other guys.

34:59.503 --> 35:03.104
I'm not afraid
to really love you.

35:03.106 --> 35:06.508
What would it be like to be
with someone alive?

35:06.510 --> 35:09.878
Who could walk you
down the aisle

35:09.880 --> 35:11.246
in front
of the whole town?

35:11.248 --> 35:13.782
And start
a family with.

35:13.784 --> 35:15.417
With me.

35:15.419 --> 35:17.118
But I tried
to kill you.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.755
Every relationship
has its stuff, right?

35:20.757 --> 35:24.593
We can stay
in the town you love

35:24.595 --> 35:26.228
a-and never leave.

35:29.433 --> 35:31.032
She's mine!

35:34.404 --> 35:36.137
Hey!

35:36.139 --> 35:37.939
No!

35:40.844 --> 35:44.179
Hey, okay, look, I'm sure
you were in love, okay?

35:44.181 --> 35:46.548
But this isn't love,
not anymore.

35:46.550 --> 35:48.283
I love her.

35:48.285 --> 35:50.318
Yes, sure, sure,
but now it's like

35:50.320 --> 35:52.320
some sort of a sick game,
you know?

35:52.322 --> 35:55.123
I mean, you have to eat people
to stay together?

35:55.125 --> 35:56.591
I mean,
is that romantic?

35:56.593 --> 35:58.293
Huh?
You enjoy that?

36:00.063 --> 36:01.396
Okay,
all right.

36:01.398 --> 36:03.532
Look, let's just think
about this for a second.

36:05.669 --> 36:07.903
Vance!

36:11.308 --> 36:13.475
Baby, kill him!

36:18.482 --> 36:19.915
Vance!

36:27.057 --> 36:28.189
You okay?

36:28.191 --> 36:31.059
Yeah.
Just grab the girl.

36:35.165 --> 36:36.898
Oh,
son of a bitch.

36:45.989 --> 36:49.090
You know, I think that guy
from the bus stop --

36:49.092 --> 36:50.525
I think
he'll be all right.

36:50.527 --> 36:52.059
I bet they'll take good care
of him at the hospital.

36:52.061 --> 36:54.762
He's also gonna wake up
with a serious headache.

36:54.764 --> 36:56.998
Better than
being killed.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.766
Hmm.

36:58.768 --> 37:02.470
Got to say, I do feel
kind of bad for the Musca.

37:03.473 --> 37:06.073
I-I mean,
he could have been happy

37:06.075 --> 37:07.508
if it stayed
with his people.

37:07.510 --> 37:09.510
Didn't have to go off on its own
just because --

37:09.512 --> 37:10.912
Okay,
I get it.

37:10.914 --> 37:12.213
I am
just like the bug,

37:12.215 --> 37:14.415
and I shouldn't
go out on my own.

37:14.417 --> 37:17.051
But your nifty metaphor
has holes.

37:21.658 --> 37:24.292
I wasn't looking
for love.

37:24.294 --> 37:26.994
I found it,
and I lost it.

37:26.996 --> 37:29.030
And I didn't kill people

37:29.032 --> 37:31.699
and literally nest
in their body parts, so...

37:31.701 --> 37:34.135
Okay,
I know, I know.

37:34.137 --> 37:35.736
How about this?

37:35.738 --> 37:37.071
Don't leave.

37:37.073 --> 37:39.774
Hear me out.

37:39.776 --> 37:41.642
Sure, some people
can do bad things

37:41.644 --> 37:43.377
when they're desperate
or scared,

37:43.379 --> 37:45.480
but I mean,
the guy we just saved,

37:45.482 --> 37:47.849
he has a wife,
children.

37:49.319 --> 37:51.719
I'm not saying all people
are good people

37:51.721 --> 37:54.355
or even that most people are,
but...

37:54.357 --> 37:56.424
if we help people,

37:56.426 --> 38:00.361
then maybe <i>they'll</i> help people
and all that.

38:00.363 --> 38:02.129
And that's worth it.

38:02.131 --> 38:04.832
Even with all the tears
and death --

38:04.834 --> 38:07.435
it's worth it.

38:15.712 --> 38:19.013
Just to be
super clear,

38:19.015 --> 38:20.381
I am not like
the fly monster.

38:21.684 --> 38:24.952
But...

38:24.954 --> 38:28.523
I'll think
about staying.

Yeah.

39:39.495 --> 39:41.295
Silver stake
through the heart --

39:41.297 --> 39:42.964
that ought
to do the trick.

39:42.966 --> 39:46.834

39:46.836 --> 39:48.202

39:54.510 --> 39:57.645
You did good,
kid.

39:58.748 --> 40:00.481
And?

40:00.483 --> 40:02.116
And what?

40:02.118 --> 40:03.351
I was right,

40:03.353 --> 40:05.586
and you should be letting me
go out on hunts.

40:05.588 --> 40:07.688
Okay.
All right.

40:09.225 --> 40:12.393
Look, it's not about
being right, okay?

40:12.395 --> 40:14.428
You're gonna make mistakes.

40:14.430 --> 40:17.365
Hell, I make them
all the time.

40:17.367 --> 40:18.833
But it's how
you handle yourself

40:18.835 --> 40:20.735
once you've made
those mistakes.

40:20.737 --> 40:22.370
And you learn
from them.

40:22.372 --> 40:24.205
And...

40:24.207 --> 40:26.874
how to not beat yourself up
over them?

40:31.714 --> 40:35.282
You know, Jack,
you're pretty smart sometimes.

40:37.387 --> 40:39.787
I tell you what --
when Sam gets back,

40:39.789 --> 40:42.456
I'll talk to him about
getting you out on more hunts.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.791
Okay?

40:43.793 --> 40:45.593
In the meantime, we'll get you
a crate of cough drops.

40:45.595 --> 40:47.294
I'm fine.

40:47.296 --> 40:50.131
It's all part
of being human, right?

40:50.133 --> 40:52.767
Mm.

41:00.810 --> 41:03.544
You sure you're okay?
