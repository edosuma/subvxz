01:50.027 --> 01:50.986
Hey, Mom.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.037
You have to let me know where you are

02:00.120 --> 02:03.207
if you want this freedom
to be on your own, okay?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.584
Sorry. I know.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.545
Happy birthday, <i>Tatay.</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:16.053
...Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

04:04.703 --> 04:08.081
<i>I never fit in</i>

04:09.166 --> 04:12.127
<i>Never could win</i>

04:13.629 --> 04:17.089
<i>Though I try and I try</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:19.760
<i>This feeling don't end</i>

04:20.802 --> 04:23.305
<i>I feel out of place</i>

04:24.306 --> 04:27.100
<i>Song out of tune</i>

04:28.602 --> 04:30.562
<i>I...</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:41.156
<i>Like a velvet chair</i>

04:41.240 --> 04:44.868
<i>In a dusty saloon</i>

04:46.453 --> 04:48.997
<i>Square peg</i>

04:50.457 --> 04:53.335
<i>Round hole</i>

05:05.097 --> 05:08.267
Thank you, Austin. I'll be here all week.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.819
Where are your books?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.114
I was gonna start now.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.799
You are so much like your <i>tatay.</i>

05:42.801 --> 05:45.679
Did you know, when you were a baby,

05:46.680 --> 05:52.978
he would get this guitar and play,
trying to make you sleep?

05:53.061 --> 05:54.855
And I would sing.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.862
I miss those days.

06:02.863 --> 06:03.989
What was it like?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.825
The Philippines?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.245
Crowded.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.538
Hot.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.293
Lots of kids everywhere.

06:17.294 --> 06:21.965
But we had our family, your friends.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.426
But your <i>tatay</i> wanted more.

06:24.510 --> 06:28.889
Ma, this isn't the life he wanted.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.058
It doesn't matter.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.271
It'll be better for you. I promise.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.061
Break time's over.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.940
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.025
- Just one room.
- One room?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.444
- Credit card and driver's license.
- Yes.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.360
- Hey, Rose.
- Hey, Elliot.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.945
What brings you in today?

08:07.029 --> 08:09.489
- I just need to get some strings.
- Sure.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.326
Could you get the ones on the left?
They're a little cheaper.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.078
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.044
- Oh, I like your notebook.
- Oh, thanks.

08:22.127 --> 08:25.214
Townes is like my spirit god.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.965
- It's like dead flowers.
- Flowers.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.467
Yeah.

08:31.887 --> 08:36.099
So when are you gonna
let me hear you play?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.812
Probably never.

08:42.105 --> 08:46.485
I don't really perform for other people.
Just kind of play for fun, I guess.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.029
Did you see this?

08:49.112 --> 08:51.990
- He's playing at Austin next week.
- Cool.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.701
I'm...

08:54.785 --> 08:59.164
I'm going if you...
If you wanted to come with.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.876
Oh, my mom wouldn't let me go.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.170
Aren't you a senior next year?

09:07.005 --> 09:10.759
I mean, it's not like a date.
Other friends will be there too.

09:12.803 --> 09:13.804
I don't know.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.515
It's summer. Come on.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.141
Ask her.

09:21.812 --> 09:26.233
- Ma?
- I already said no, and that's it. No!

09:26.316 --> 09:29.695
Ma, I'm almost 18.
I'll be able to do things on my own.

09:29.778 --> 09:33.532
This isn't fair! Most teenagers are
allowed to go out. It's normal.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.158
I said, no!

09:35.242 --> 09:38.203
You're ridiculously conservative!

09:44.751 --> 09:45.919
What happened?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.964
She wants to go to Austin.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.093
She's young. She wants to have fun.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.056
You're so <i>mojigata.</i>

09:58.140 --> 10:00.434
I received another letter.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.311
You still have that lawyer?

10:02.394 --> 10:03.812
No.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.731
He was a sham.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.442
He just took our money,
and then he's gone.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.030
Alan asked me out again.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.740
I'm almost 40, Cilla.

10:14.823 --> 10:18.869
I've been here 12 years with no papers.
Alan is fine if I can stay.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.334
- Did you tell Rosario about the letter?
- Hey!

10:25.417 --> 10:26.919
You two get back to work!

10:27.002 --> 10:30.005
And you, tacos tonight!

10:30.088 --> 10:32.716
Yes, Mr. Alan!

10:36.970 --> 10:40.140
Thanks for the dinner.
It was great. What is this called again?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.601
- Kaldereta.
- Kaldereta.

10:43.894 --> 10:44.728
It was great.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.856
- And I'll have Rose home after church.
- Thank you.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.525
Ma. It...

10:49.608 --> 10:52.194
We're gonna be late for...
Yeah. Thanks for dinner.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.581
- Elliot, don't look.
- Okay.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.252
- Don't look!
- All right! Sorry.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.045
- I'm almost done.
- Okay.

11:16.927 --> 11:20.055
Oh, here. Before I forget.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.270
It looks so real.

11:27.229 --> 11:31.024
- It was easy. It's click, click, buy.
- Aren't you scared you'll get caught?

11:31.108 --> 11:32.985
Look, nothing bad will happen.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.071
And if something does happen,
which it won't,

11:36.154 --> 11:38.156
you're lucky your mom is so nice.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.450
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

11:40.534 --> 11:45.622
Yeah. I mean, you've got a car,
you're gonna have a UT dorm this fall.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.333
Me, I'm gonna die in that shitty motel
and never get to leave.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.085
Oh, don't say that.

11:51.795 --> 11:55.591
Elliot, this is my first trip
to Austin ever.

12:05.184 --> 12:08.729
So when are you gonna
let me hear you sing?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.315
Probably never.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.485
- All right. Guess I'm turning around.
- Don't!

12:18.197 --> 12:19.698
If I sing, you can't look at me.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.825
- Just keep driving or else I get nervous.
- What?

12:21.909 --> 12:24.620
Just don't... If you look at me,
then I'm gonna get nervous.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.455
Okay, okay.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.879
No, no, no. That's not singing.
Come on. Like, "sing" sing.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.255
Okay.

12:37.549 --> 12:41.553
<i>Do you think it's unkind to suppose</i>

12:42.554 --> 12:47.017
<i>That the desert's no home for a rose</i>

12:47.100 --> 12:51.063
<i>Guess I'll always wish that I knew</i>

12:51.146 --> 12:55.567
<i>Those things that you told me</i>

12:55.651 --> 12:59.696
<i>Sometimes it's so real, I could swear</i>

12:59.780 --> 13:04.243
<i>I could see you standing right there</i>

13:04.326 --> 13:10.832
<i>With the sand in your eyes
And your hair all windblown</i>

13:10.916 --> 13:15.921
<i>What a welcome sight you'd be tonight</i>

13:16.004 --> 13:20.217
<i>All windblown</i>

13:25.347 --> 13:26.932
Thanks.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.618
- So this is the famous Broken Spoke?
- Yes, ma'am.

14:31.580 --> 14:35.167
Can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you a drink?

14:36.168 --> 14:39.963
Come on. You can't be a good girl
every night. Come on.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.299
Where are your friends?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.219
Oh, they're all busy today.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.578
Willie tried to kill himself
on the side of the road in Nashville

15:11.662 --> 15:13.205
before he wrote that song.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.000
Oh, yeah. Tootsie Orchid Lounge.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.962
And, actually,
he wasn't trying to kill himself.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.047
He was just drunk.

15:24.216 --> 15:27.261
That's impressive from someone like you.

15:28.554 --> 15:31.181
Well, there are all kinds of fans.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.518
I suppose you're right.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.695
That was Dale Watson.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.115
The guy you talked to.
That was Dale Watson.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.118
Yeah.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.911
Oh, shit.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.205
Here, sober you up.

15:56.206 --> 16:01.795
Hey, welcome, everybody,
to the Broken Spoke,

16:01.879 --> 16:05.841
the last true Texas dance hall.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.051
So I want you to show me
what that looks like

16:08.135 --> 16:15.100
as I proudly introduce
our very own Dale Watson!

16:30.741 --> 16:33.577
<i>Oh, I lie when I drink</i>

16:34.703 --> 16:37.539
<i>And I drink a lot</i>

16:37.623 --> 16:43.670
<i>Don't believe me when I've had a few</i>

16:43.754 --> 16:47.841
<i>Oh, I lie when I drink</i>

16:47.925 --> 16:50.886
<i>And I drink a lot</i>

16:50.969 --> 16:56.058
<i>I only drink when I'm missing you</i>

16:57.059 --> 17:03.232
<i>I only drink when I'm missing you</i>

17:06.527 --> 17:07.444
Thank you!

17:40.102 --> 17:41.854
Shit!

17:50.028 --> 17:51.238
Just a minute!

17:53.532 --> 17:55.242
Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.703
- Just a minute!
- I need you to open up. Open up, ma'am.

17:58.954 --> 18:03.834
Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
We have a warrant! Open up, ma'am.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.337
We have a warrant for the arrest
of Priscilla Garcia. Are you Garcia?

18:07.421 --> 18:08.672
Kitchen.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.758
Does anyone else here reside with you?
Is there anyone who lives here?

18:11.842 --> 18:13.468
- No! No.
- No one resides with you?

18:13.552 --> 18:15.262
- No other residents? Nothing?
- No. No.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.430
- Are you Garcia?
- Yes.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.723
- You're Garcia?
- Yes. Yes.

18:17.806 --> 18:21.226
- All right. Come on, let's go.
- Can I change?

18:21.310 --> 18:24.855
Two minutes. Go. Go!

18:32.154 --> 18:33.739
Rose? Wake up.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.416
All right. Let's get her in the van.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.043
- Let's go.
- Ma?

18:47.127 --> 18:50.714
Ma? Ma! Ma!

18:53.342 --> 18:54.635
Rose, wait!

18:54.718 --> 18:57.346
Where are they taking you, Ma?
What the fuck is happening?

18:57.429 --> 19:01.433
- Rose, come on! Come on! Shit!
- Ma!

19:03.727 --> 19:05.604
All right. Let's go.

19:17.908 --> 19:20.118
Let it go. Let it go.

19:22.788 --> 19:24.957
- Stop the car.
- What?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.877
- Elliot, stop the car.
- Rose...

19:29.878 --> 19:31.505
Elliot, stop the car!

20:46.496 --> 20:48.081
Rose.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.719
Come on. We gotta go.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.055
Where?

21:03.138 --> 21:05.265
I don't have a home.

21:07.059 --> 21:09.102
We'll find out what happened to your mom.

21:09.186 --> 21:11.313
I know what happened!

21:12.314 --> 21:15.317
- We'll help her.
- How, Elliot?

21:16.318 --> 21:18.904
She told me we were fine!

21:20.906 --> 21:25.911
When my dad died,
she told me his status applied to us!

21:27.120 --> 21:28.872
Shit.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.252
I'm illegal! I'm illegal alien!

21:33.335 --> 21:36.046
I know. I know!

21:39.758 --> 21:42.553
Elliot, I have to get out of here.
I need to get my stuff.

21:42.636 --> 21:45.264
I'm not going to foster care.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.412
That's the guy from Reception.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.791
I don't have a choice, Elliot.
I have to get my stuff.

22:12.875 --> 22:15.919
Rose, that shit's crazy. It's not safe.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.213
Thank you.

22:18.297 --> 22:19.673
For what?

22:19.756 --> 22:22.843
Being a friend, taking me to Austin.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.723
Wait, Rose.

22:30.642 --> 22:33.562
Just be safe. I'll be right here.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.198
Come on. Come on.

23:34.373 --> 23:35.832
- Hey, Rose!
- Shit!

23:36.834 --> 23:40.128
- Elliot, start the car!
- Hey, Rose! I need to talk to you!

23:40.212 --> 23:43.340
Rose? You're leaving? No, no, no!

23:43.423 --> 23:45.676
Don't leave. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

23:45.759 --> 23:48.637
- Go!
- Hey! Hey! Don't!

23:48.720 --> 23:50.973
Sorry, Mr. Alan!

23:51.974 --> 23:53.517
Rose!

23:57.896 --> 24:00.482
- Nice driving.
- Thanks.

24:07.072 --> 24:09.241
- Well, we did it.
- Yeah.

24:10.242 --> 24:12.828
- Thanks.
- No problem.

24:17.916 --> 24:21.086
You know, my mom was screaming
something about a letter.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.588
Oh, yeah?

24:22.671 --> 24:24.131
Yeah.

24:56.580 --> 24:57.414
What's that?

24:59.041 --> 25:01.126
My mom's necklace.

25:12.387 --> 25:15.057
"Dear Rose, if you're reading this,

25:15.140 --> 25:18.185
the thing that I've been afraid of
must already have happened.

25:19.186 --> 25:24.566
I've put together all that you'll need.
Your <i>Tita</i> Gail has power of attorney.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.195
Go to her.

25:30.948 --> 25:35.744
Please bring all the documents.
These will help you, so you can stay here.

25:39.665 --> 25:44.962
I'm sorry if I was not able
to tell this to you in person.

25:49.174 --> 25:51.385
I love you very much."

25:58.892 --> 26:00.102
I'm sorry.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.854
It's okay.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.446
She wants me to go
to my <i>Tita</i> Gail's house.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.241
What's a <i>tita?</i>

26:14.324 --> 26:15.909
My aunt.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.871
Do you mind driving me there?

26:18.954 --> 26:20.873
Yeah, of course.

26:24.126 --> 26:26.211
I'm really sorry, Rose.

26:37.931 --> 26:39.266
Fancy place.

26:40.601 --> 26:42.060
What are you gonna tell your dad?

26:43.145 --> 26:47.107
I mean, I told him that I was
crisis-counseling a friend on an edge.

26:47.191 --> 26:49.902
- Well, pretty close to the truth.
- Yeah.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.910
Do you need me to, like...?

26:58.911 --> 27:01.079
Like, walk you in?

27:01.163 --> 27:02.664
No.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.083
Okay.

27:09.254 --> 27:10.589
Are you okay?

27:11.590 --> 27:13.634
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

27:48.836 --> 27:50.254
Hi, <i>Tita.</i>

27:50.337 --> 27:53.257
I'm Rose, Priscilla's daughter.

28:00.430 --> 28:03.058
Sophie! Come on inside.

28:03.141 --> 28:05.978
Come meet your cousin!

28:09.356 --> 28:14.111
I'm sorry. We're both juicing,
so that is all we have.

28:15.112 --> 28:16.238
Can you hold this?

28:16.321 --> 28:19.199
So my mom's been talking to you
about the situation?

28:19.283 --> 28:21.869
No, she hasn't.

28:21.952 --> 28:25.873
I had no idea
that she was in this much trouble.

28:26.874 --> 28:29.501
I'm so sorry for your situation.

28:30.502 --> 28:32.421
So I'm just supposed to live here?

28:33.422 --> 28:34.840
I don't know.

28:34.923 --> 28:37.593
- No.
- I'll have to ask my husband.

28:38.594 --> 28:41.471
- Yeah, we have to ask Daddy.
- Yeah.

28:41.555 --> 28:43.056
- Why?
- Because...

28:43.140 --> 28:45.475
She's never coming back, is she?

28:51.398 --> 28:53.525
Think I need to go to sleep now.

28:54.526 --> 28:57.696
All right. Let's go upstairs.

29:01.033 --> 29:05.037
I think my husband's gonna need
to see some paperwork.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.332
- Yes, it's in my backpack.
- All right.

29:16.548 --> 29:17.925
I found it!

29:24.181 --> 29:26.517
I think you are going to love this.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.560
Let's see.

29:35.192 --> 29:40.572
Yeah, your mom was about 19, and I was 17.

29:41.573 --> 29:44.743
Y'all look the same as you do now.

29:46.286 --> 29:50.499
- That was a very long time ago.
- How come you stopped talking to Ma?

29:56.380 --> 29:57.965
I'm not sure.

29:58.966 --> 30:03.846
Your mom and I lived
very different lives in the U.S.

30:05.597 --> 30:09.059
I saw her about five years ago for lunch.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.354
But then my husband...

30:14.147 --> 30:16.191
We have the same necklace.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.575
Yeah.

30:24.658 --> 30:26.952
Your <i>lola</i> gave this to us.

30:28.328 --> 30:31.874
Your mom and I used to be very close.

30:34.793 --> 30:37.462
I guess we just drifted apart.

30:41.717 --> 30:43.760
This whole time...

30:44.761 --> 30:46.847
you were right here?

30:50.392 --> 30:55.439
When Dad died, you know,
Ma and I could have really used your help.

30:55.522 --> 30:57.774
I know. I know.

31:04.406 --> 31:06.491
And I'm sorry.

31:12.873 --> 31:15.000
I'm gonna go for a walk.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.877
- Get some fresh air.
- Okay.

31:17.878 --> 31:19.463
Don't stay out too long.

31:19.546 --> 31:21.131
I won't.

32:19.106 --> 32:21.108
I recognize you.

32:22.109 --> 32:23.569
You were here the other night.

32:24.570 --> 32:25.737
Yes, ma'am.

32:26.738 --> 32:29.741
You weren't 21 the other night either.

32:29.825 --> 32:31.660
Yes, ma'am.

32:33.161 --> 32:34.997
Why are you here, honey?

32:35.080 --> 32:37.541
I needed to get away.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.419
Coke or sweet tea?

32:40.502 --> 32:43.839
Coke, please. Either, really. Thank you.

32:48.677 --> 32:50.846
- You look hungry.
- Oh, I am.

32:51.847 --> 32:56.643
I'm not homeless or anything,
but I could eat. Thank you.

32:56.727 --> 32:58.979
What's going on, darling?

33:05.277 --> 33:07.279
- Refill.
- Oh, thank you.

33:08.655 --> 33:11.200
Thank you for the food and for listening.

33:12.201 --> 33:14.286
It feels really good to tell someone.

33:15.287 --> 33:16.288
Any time.

33:17.289 --> 33:20.125
And you'll let me know
if you need a safe place.

33:20.209 --> 33:22.836
That's what they're calling it
these days, right?

33:22.920 --> 33:24.505
Yeah.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.256
Thank you.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.892
You've been living in Texas now
for seven years

33:36.975 --> 33:39.186
without proper documentation.

33:39.269 --> 33:44.316
You violated three different
court appearances in the last two years.

33:44.399 --> 33:46.401
So, what happens now?

33:46.485 --> 33:48.612
You will likely get deported.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.656
If you sign this...

33:52.157 --> 33:54.952
...they might let you come back
in 10 years.

33:57.538 --> 34:04.211
So I should just turn myself in
after all we've fought for to stay?

34:05.212 --> 34:10.551
Honestly, Mrs. Garcia,
it may be the best option for your family.

34:12.052 --> 34:13.804
Can I think about this?

34:13.887 --> 34:15.681
Of course.

34:19.268 --> 34:20.978
Jesus, are you all right?

34:21.061 --> 34:26.608
The house is nice and all,
but I feel really, really out of place.

34:26.692 --> 34:28.569
It all feels unreal.

34:29.570 --> 34:31.487
Yeah, I can imagine.

34:31.572 --> 34:34.867
<i>Elliot, I need to find my mom.</i>

34:34.949 --> 34:38.286
I'm sure they won't let her contact me
because she hasn't even called me yet.

34:38.370 --> 34:39.204
Let me help.

34:39.288 --> 34:42.081
<i>I've been thinking about my cousin.
She does immigration law.</i>

34:42.165 --> 34:43.333
- Thank you.
- Sophie!

34:43.417 --> 34:45.502
I gotta go. Thank you so much.
I'll call you back.

34:53.969 --> 34:55.637
Made you look!

34:58.098 --> 35:00.642
What happened to your mommy?

35:02.519 --> 35:07.858
Some people came to the house and told her
that she didn't belong here anymore.

35:07.941 --> 35:09.860
Why?

35:11.820 --> 35:13.780
Because they didn't think
this was her home.

35:13.864 --> 35:15.866
Why?

35:17.492 --> 35:19.620
I don't really know, coz.

35:20.954 --> 35:23.498
- Do you want to hear a song? Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.210
- Promise you won't laugh at me?
- Yeah.

35:26.293 --> 35:28.629
- Pinkie promise?
- Yeah.

35:34.635 --> 35:37.513
<i>I'll never fit in</i>

35:38.805 --> 35:41.517
<i>Never could win</i>

35:43.185 --> 35:49.691
<i>Though I tried and tried
This feeling don't end</i>

35:50.692 --> 35:53.737
<i>I feel out of place</i>

35:54.738 --> 35:57.449
<i>Song out of tune</i>

35:59.076 --> 36:02.162
<i>Like a velvet chair</i>

36:02.246 --> 36:05.457
<i>In a dusty saloon</i>

36:07.292 --> 36:10.712
<i>Square peg</i>

36:11.755 --> 36:14.174
<i>Round hole</i>

36:15.175 --> 36:21.974
<i>A runaway with nowhere to go</i>

36:38.991 --> 36:40.951
N-29?

36:41.034 --> 36:42.286
N-29?

36:44.079 --> 36:46.832
Up and at them.
Let's go. Put your shoes on.

36:46.915 --> 36:49.960
N-30? You're gonna get in line.

36:50.961 --> 36:52.921
N-30, let's go. Get up.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.548
You're gonna get in line.

36:55.883 --> 36:58.760
N-35? Let's go.

37:00.304 --> 37:01.972
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

37:02.055 --> 37:05.267
You're gonna get in line. Let's go.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.519
Where are you taking her?
Where are you taking her?

37:08.520 --> 37:10.939
You need to get back in bed
or you're gonna go.

37:11.023 --> 37:13.817
Let's go! What are you doing? Let's go!

37:13.901 --> 37:15.527
Come on!

37:19.740 --> 37:22.534
- Why is she still here?
- I told you, Mark.

37:22.618 --> 37:25.287
No, you told me it was gonna be temporary.

37:25.370 --> 37:28.040
And I told you
I didn't even wanna do that.

37:28.123 --> 37:30.751
It makes me nervous.
She's gonna get us arrested.

37:30.834 --> 37:35.130
- No one is going to get arrested, Mark.
- We have enough to worry about.

37:35.214 --> 37:38.300
- Mark, I told you...
- We already have one daughter.

37:39.635 --> 37:40.761
We don't need another one.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.875
Rose! Stop!

38:54.376 --> 38:56.086
This wasn't part of the plan!

38:56.170 --> 38:57.963
I'm sorry, <i>Tita.</i>
I don't wanna be a burden.

38:58.046 --> 39:00.174
- But you're not.
- Y'all don't even want me here.

39:00.257 --> 39:02.509
Oh, for God's sake.

39:03.677 --> 39:06.388
I just don't want you going
with somebody that I don't know.

39:06.471 --> 39:08.223
- Bye, coz.
- Bye, Rose.

39:08.307 --> 39:10.475
- Let her go, Gail.
- Oh, shut up.

39:17.107 --> 39:19.067
Rose, give me your phone.

39:19.151 --> 39:21.361
Give me your phone.

39:34.917 --> 39:37.127
- Call me if you need anything.
- I will.

39:38.128 --> 39:40.005
Thank you, <i>Tita.</i>

39:48.055 --> 39:50.599
I don't need to talk to these people?

39:50.682 --> 39:52.059
No.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.728
Alrighty.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.117
So this is it.

40:10.118 --> 40:14.790
It's clean, but it ain't quiet,
being in a bar and such.

40:14.873 --> 40:18.752
- Okay. I usually sleep through anything.
- Good.

40:18.836 --> 40:23.382
And, oh, Jose is gonna get you started
with some work in the kitchen.

40:23.465 --> 40:24.550
Cool.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.386
Hey, put your stuff down.

40:27.469 --> 40:28.971
You're home.

40:29.054 --> 40:30.639
Thanks.

40:32.224 --> 40:35.644
I told Dale
that you would help sell the merch.

40:35.727 --> 40:37.938
Okay. What's merch?

40:39.356 --> 40:41.233
Merchandise, sweetie.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.277
- Merchandise.
- Oh, of course.

40:46.655 --> 40:49.032
They're readying Priscilla Garcia
for deportation.

40:49.116 --> 40:52.536
She's in Dallas now, which is usually
the last step in the process.

40:52.619 --> 40:56.081
My prediction is,
she'll be gone in a few weeks.

40:56.164 --> 40:58.458
Will they be looking
for her 17-year-old daughter?

40:59.459 --> 41:01.336
The answer's maybe.

41:01.420 --> 41:03.547
- Is she with family?
- Yes, her aunt.

41:03.630 --> 41:06.842
- Have they set anything up legally?
- I don't know.

41:06.925 --> 41:09.344
She hasn't even talked to her mom
on the phone yet.

41:09.428 --> 41:11.930
They're supposed to let her have
a phone call, and I imagine

41:12.014 --> 41:14.266
once mom and daughter are reconnected,

41:14.349 --> 41:19.104
they'll decide if she's gonna go with her
or try to find a way to stay here somehow.

41:20.355 --> 41:23.233
- If we need your help, we can call you?
- Of course. Yeah.

41:23.317 --> 41:24.985
Thanks, coz.

41:31.450 --> 41:32.618
You ready?

41:32.701 --> 41:36.038
Okay, so you're gonna push that through,
all the way in.

41:36.121 --> 41:39.082
Yeah. And then you push this down.

41:39.166 --> 41:40.709
It gets stuck sometimes.

41:40.792 --> 41:44.213
The plates over here.

41:44.296 --> 41:47.424
And then you put the cups up here.

41:47.508 --> 41:51.220
You have to make sure that
the bottom is down, that way all the...

41:52.930 --> 41:56.225
- Do you need to get that?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

41:57.809 --> 42:00.854
<i>This is a collect call
from Rolling Plains Correctional Facility.</i>

42:00.938 --> 42:03.941
- <i>Do you accept the charges?</i>
- Yes! Yes!

42:05.150 --> 42:07.569
- Ma?
- Rosario.

42:07.653 --> 42:09.029
Ma!

42:09.112 --> 42:11.990
It's so good to hear your voice.
I miss you so much.

42:12.074 --> 42:13.325
I miss you too.

42:13.408 --> 42:16.203
- Are you okay?
- <i>They moved me to a new place.</i>

42:16.286 --> 42:18.789
That's why I wasn't able to call earlier.

42:18.872 --> 42:21.834
How's <i>Tita</i> Gail? Is it good there?

42:21.917 --> 42:23.669
Yeah, she's fine.

42:23.752 --> 42:26.964
- Well...
- I'm so happy that you're safe with her.

42:27.047 --> 42:30.551
If I don't get back,
she will register you for school.

42:30.634 --> 42:32.469
- <i>Ma...</i>
- I hope you brought your textbook

42:32.553 --> 42:34.012
- so you can study.
- <i>Ma!</i>

42:34.096 --> 42:36.849
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm not with <i>Tita</i> Gail anymore.

42:36.932 --> 42:40.185
I'm somewhere
where they're really taking care of me.

42:40.269 --> 42:42.771
What are you talking about?

42:42.855 --> 42:45.899
I'm living in a really nice room
behind a bar where they play music,

42:45.983 --> 42:47.901
but they're helping me, Ma.

42:47.985 --> 42:49.403
You live in a bar?

42:49.486 --> 42:51.363
<i>Rose!</i>

42:51.446 --> 42:54.741
Go back to <i>Tita</i> Gail's.
I want you to be safe. Please.

42:56.994 --> 42:59.371
Ma, you didn't even tell me.

43:00.914 --> 43:02.875
I didn't want you to worry.

43:02.958 --> 43:04.793
<i>I'm sorry, Rose.</i>

43:04.877 --> 43:06.378
<i>I gotta go.</i>

43:06.461 --> 43:09.256
- I love you.
- <i>Ma! Wait!</i>

43:09.339 --> 43:10.716
Ma!

43:35.616 --> 43:36.491
Hey.

43:37.492 --> 43:38.952
Hey.

43:43.498 --> 43:45.792
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

43:47.085 --> 43:49.296
Do you feel safe working here?

43:50.297 --> 43:53.467
Doesn't matter. I really need the money.

43:54.468 --> 43:55.969
What year are you?

43:56.053 --> 43:57.095
Senior.

43:58.096 --> 44:00.807
I'm a little behind but not by much.

44:00.891 --> 44:04.353
I had a rough patch.

44:05.729 --> 44:09.149
What happened,
if you don't mind my asking?

44:10.150 --> 44:12.110
My parents got deported.

44:13.111 --> 44:15.572
And this was a while ago,
if you can believe it.

44:15.656 --> 44:20.702
And now it's sort of really in fashion,
I guess you could say.

44:23.914 --> 44:25.916
And you didn't want to go with them?

44:27.000 --> 44:27.835
Nah.

44:28.836 --> 44:30.587
Sucks but...

44:32.381 --> 44:34.591
More opportunity here.

44:38.679 --> 44:40.389
I'm illegal.

44:44.810 --> 44:45.644
No shit?

44:47.479 --> 44:49.439
Me too.

44:51.692 --> 44:54.111
I think they call it undocumented.

44:54.194 --> 44:55.612
Yeah.

44:56.780 --> 44:58.532
Aren't you scared?

45:01.660 --> 45:03.078
Yeah.

45:04.496 --> 45:05.747
But you get used to it.

45:14.214 --> 45:19.136
<i>Will I speak or just stay quiet and accept</i>

45:19.219 --> 45:21.305
<i>A tender hand?</i>

45:21.388 --> 45:22.222
<i>I...</i>

45:22.306 --> 45:23.265
Yeah?

45:23.348 --> 45:24.516
- Hey, Rose?
- Hey.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.810
Sorry to bother you, hon.
I forgot my guitar.

45:26.894 --> 45:28.812
Oh, that's fine. Yeah. Sure.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.482
I didn't even realize you played.

45:33.483 --> 45:35.694
That sounded really good.

45:42.492 --> 45:44.745
- Beautiful.
- How did you do that?

45:44.828 --> 45:48.123
Well, it's a catchy song,
and I've been doing this a while.

45:49.124 --> 45:51.835
When are y'all gonna release new material?

45:51.919 --> 45:55.047
That is a question. And it's complicated.

45:56.048 --> 45:59.426
I seem to make
everything complicated, Rose.

46:01.261 --> 46:03.263
How'd it go after those?

46:03.347 --> 46:04.848
D.

46:06.308 --> 46:08.060
<i>And I pay some mind</i>

46:08.143 --> 46:09.853
- Back to D.
- That's really pretty.

46:09.937 --> 46:11.855
- Thanks. Thanks.
- That's nice.

46:11.939 --> 46:15.317
<i>Gotta get rollin'
Gotta hit that road again</i>

46:16.777 --> 46:20.197
<i>Where tomorrow finds me
Ain't nobody knows</i>

46:21.698 --> 46:25.077
<i>There ain't nothin' better
Than life out on the road</i>

46:26.328 --> 46:28.956
- <i>No, there ain't nothing better</i>
- Fifteen dollars, please.

46:29.039 --> 46:31.333
<i>Than life out on the road</i>

46:41.009 --> 46:44.513
Good job, kid. You sold a lot.

46:44.596 --> 46:47.391
Thanks. Wasn't as hard as I thought.

46:50.143 --> 46:51.895
Do you wanna do this world?

46:52.938 --> 46:54.481
Singing?

46:55.482 --> 46:59.820
- How'd you know that?
- Oh, I heard you playing in your room.

47:00.821 --> 47:03.073
Beautiful. Really.

47:04.074 --> 47:05.659
Thanks.

47:05.742 --> 47:09.454
I don't really sing
for anyone but myself though.

47:11.748 --> 47:16.295
Well, you better get over that, right?

47:17.963 --> 47:18.964
Night, darling.

47:26.013 --> 47:29.224
<i>This is a collect call
from Rolling Plains Correctional Facility.</i>

47:29.308 --> 47:30.976
- <i>Will you accept the charges?</i>
- Yes, yes!

47:31.977 --> 47:35.022
Ma? Ma? Is everything okay?

47:35.105 --> 47:37.774
<i>Listen, I've been thinking.</i>

47:37.858 --> 47:39.568
In fact, all I do is think.

47:40.569 --> 47:43.363
You must go back to <i>Tita</i> Gail's.

47:43.447 --> 47:45.949
<i>You are in danger,
and she can protect you.</i>

47:46.033 --> 47:49.328
I can't have you living in a bar.
It's not safe.

47:49.411 --> 47:50.746
Ma, you don't understand.

47:50.829 --> 47:54.291
They didn't want me there,
and I'm finding my way here.

47:54.374 --> 47:57.377
Rose, please don't do this to me.

47:57.461 --> 47:59.796
Don't do this to you?

47:59.880 --> 48:02.716
Rose, if you can't go back to <i>Tita</i> Gail's,

48:02.799 --> 48:06.386
then I insist that you come back
to Manila with me.

48:06.470 --> 48:08.680
What? No, Ma. Absolutely not.

48:08.764 --> 48:11.141
I can't have my daughter
in danger like this.

48:11.225 --> 48:14.186
You're the one who said
all my opportunities were here!

48:14.269 --> 48:15.938
<i>Things have changed.</i>

48:17.397 --> 48:19.316
They're making me go.

48:20.442 --> 48:21.944
Please, consider it.

48:22.945 --> 48:25.864
Please. Bye.

48:27.991 --> 48:28.825
<i>Ma?</i>

48:34.373 --> 48:36.166
Fuck!

48:37.960 --> 48:39.044
Fuck!

48:46.718 --> 48:47.886
Hi.

48:47.970 --> 48:49.137
Hey.

48:50.138 --> 48:51.557
What?

48:56.186 --> 49:00.649
I just wanted to see how you were.
I mean, I was grounded. Now I'm not.

49:01.817 --> 49:05.696
- It's good to see you.
- You too. Are you okay?

49:08.156 --> 49:09.908
Okay.

49:26.049 --> 49:27.593
Okay.

49:32.598 --> 49:33.765
Come on.

49:34.766 --> 49:37.603
- I think I'm drunk.
- Yeah. I think so too.

49:37.686 --> 49:39.021
Come on.

49:40.022 --> 49:42.274
Just don't barf, okay?

49:42.357 --> 49:45.027
Elliot, did you know I'm a country singer?

49:45.110 --> 49:46.361
Yes.

49:46.445 --> 49:48.030
Yes, I do.

49:48.113 --> 49:50.199
You're so smart.

49:52.492 --> 49:54.119
Perfect.

50:21.188 --> 50:25.317
Immigration and Customs Enforcement!
Open up!

50:33.450 --> 50:35.953
Immigration and Customs Enforcement!

50:36.036 --> 50:38.455
We have a warrant to search!

50:38.539 --> 50:40.707
Please open up!

50:46.088 --> 50:50.217
All right, we are gonna breach the door!
Please stand back!

50:50.300 --> 50:53.178
Three, two, one!

50:54.179 --> 50:56.390
- Go, go, go!
- Move, move, move!

50:56.473 --> 50:57.975
Check those quarters.

50:58.058 --> 51:00.143
No runners! No runners!

51:01.144 --> 51:02.813
Why don't you take the bar?

51:02.896 --> 51:06.817
You guys take the kitchen over there.
You come with me. Let's go.

51:06.900 --> 51:08.944
I wanna cover the east side!

51:09.027 --> 51:12.865
Let's get those exits covered!
I don't want any runners! Let's go!

51:12.948 --> 51:15.284
You check out that back there.
I'm gonna search in here.

51:15.367 --> 51:16.910
Yes, sir.

51:28.964 --> 51:31.341
- Storeroom all clear. Moving on.
- Clear.

51:43.896 --> 51:45.647
Okay.

51:45.731 --> 51:47.733
All clear. All clear.

51:47.816 --> 51:50.319
- Put your hands up!
- Let me see your hands!

51:50.402 --> 51:52.196
- Get up! Stand up!
- Anybody else?

51:52.279 --> 51:54.823
- Put your hands on your head!
- Hands up! Hands behind your head!

51:55.824 --> 51:58.493
- This way.
- Hands over your head!

51:58.577 --> 52:00.287
Come on.

52:00.370 --> 52:01.914
Let's go.

52:02.915 --> 52:03.957
Hands up!

52:04.958 --> 52:06.919
Pry bar up. Let's go. Move it.

52:54.174 --> 52:55.217
Please.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.927
Please.

53:00.681 --> 53:02.224
Hey!

53:02.307 --> 53:03.725
Yo!

53:04.852 --> 53:06.854
You all right? You all clear?

53:10.148 --> 53:11.817
All clear.

53:11.900 --> 53:14.152
All right. Let's move.

53:17.990 --> 53:20.909
Come on, this way. Out the back. Let's go.

53:48.645 --> 53:50.397
Jolene?

53:52.065 --> 53:53.233
Rose!

53:53.317 --> 53:57.154
Oh, Rose! Thank the good Lord in heaven.

53:59.448 --> 54:02.701
I was hiding in the back,
and I heard your car pull up.

54:02.784 --> 54:04.119
Oh, smart girl.

54:05.120 --> 54:08.916
Oh, I'm so glad you're here
and you're okay.

54:11.627 --> 54:14.379
- What a mess, huh?
- Yeah.

54:15.964 --> 54:17.090
Here, sit down.

54:18.091 --> 54:19.510
I'm doing books.

54:19.593 --> 54:23.138
It's gonna take me a while
to recover from this financially,

54:23.222 --> 54:25.766
but mostly, I just...

54:27.100 --> 54:29.937
Well, I just...
I hate what happened to Jose and...

54:32.397 --> 54:35.943
I'm guessing it's not really a good time
for me to be here.

54:36.026 --> 54:38.820
No, darling, it's not.

54:40.822 --> 54:44.326
And you're lucky
to be walking around free, I reckon.

54:45.327 --> 54:46.537
Yeah.

54:46.620 --> 54:49.081
I guess I'm lucky.

54:51.583 --> 54:53.460
Darling, listen to me.

54:55.504 --> 54:58.131
I know you have a world of hurt right now,

54:59.132 --> 55:03.178
but you gotta keep the faith, okay?

55:05.806 --> 55:07.140
I'm so sorry.

55:08.433 --> 55:10.602
- I should go get the rest of my stuff.
- Wait, wait.

55:13.355 --> 55:15.732
I want you to have this.

55:15.816 --> 55:18.277
He might be able to help you.

55:19.278 --> 55:20.737
And you need some money.

55:20.821 --> 55:22.573
- No, no.
- Yes.

55:22.656 --> 55:24.491
I want you to take this.

55:25.492 --> 55:27.744
I wish I could do more.

55:29.955 --> 55:31.790
Oh, baby.

55:37.838 --> 55:40.257
Take care of yourself, okay?

55:40.340 --> 55:41.925
Thank you.

55:45.137 --> 55:47.222
Rosie, check in with me, okay?

55:47.306 --> 55:49.433
I will. Thank you.

56:41.818 --> 56:43.779
Figured you might show up.

56:43.862 --> 56:46.949
Jolene said you might help.
I didn't have any place to go.

56:47.032 --> 56:48.742
Come on in.

56:51.662 --> 56:53.747
- Are you sure this is okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

56:53.830 --> 56:56.208
You know, Jolene told me about ICE,

56:56.291 --> 56:59.503
and I'm really sorry
to hear about your ma.

57:01.129 --> 57:04.299
- Is that you and Johnny Cash?
- Yeah.

57:04.383 --> 57:07.344
Man in Black. That was the Grand Ole Opry.

57:07.427 --> 57:10.222
You look different.

57:11.306 --> 57:13.016
Yeah, a little less white hair, huh?

57:14.017 --> 57:15.519
Where should I put my stuff?

57:15.602 --> 57:18.313
Well, not in my daughter's room.

57:18.397 --> 57:21.316
- You have a daughter?
- I got two of them.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.068
They're all grown now,

57:23.151 --> 57:26.363
but it's probably best
you stay in the Airstream.

57:26.446 --> 57:28.615
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.

57:30.033 --> 57:32.744
Watch your footing here.
It's a little up and down.

57:33.745 --> 57:36.164
We got plenty of room.
We got the bus right there.

57:36.248 --> 57:38.083
- This is Loretta.
- She's beautiful.

57:38.166 --> 57:40.002
- Here, let me take that.
- Oh, thanks.

57:41.003 --> 57:42.796
And, of course, a recording studio.

57:42.880 --> 57:45.924
- This?
- Yeah. Made a lot of records there.

57:46.008 --> 57:49.469
Maybe we might do a demo on you.
Who knows?

57:50.596 --> 57:52.222
And there she is.

57:52.306 --> 57:54.183
Cool!

57:55.184 --> 57:56.643
Well...

57:57.644 --> 58:00.022
you ain't seen the inside yet.

58:01.315 --> 58:04.067
- Oh, wow, this is amazing.
- Oh, it's a mess.

58:04.151 --> 58:08.030
It's a green room, you know,
for the studio, but it'll do.

58:08.113 --> 58:09.573
Oh, it's perfect.

58:09.656 --> 58:12.743
Bed's there,
bathroom's a little further than there,

58:12.826 --> 58:14.244
and it's all yours.

58:14.328 --> 58:15.746
Home sweet home.

58:15.829 --> 58:18.373
- Thanks, Dale.
- You need me, holler.

58:45.150 --> 58:46.777
Thanks.

58:49.446 --> 58:51.156
How's it going?

58:51.240 --> 58:52.366
It's no good.

58:53.367 --> 58:56.954
Gotta let it...
Let it roll, let it come out.

58:58.080 --> 59:01.917
You know, all the stuff with your mom,
just let it come out.

59:05.379 --> 59:07.881
So, what's on your mind right now?

59:08.882 --> 59:12.886
Figuring out what to do,
where to go, where to stay.

59:14.346 --> 59:19.601
Honey, I don't know anything about law,
other than running from it a day or two.

59:20.602 --> 59:24.439
But what I do know is
that you stay true to yourself.

59:24.523 --> 59:26.775
I don't get it.
Do you think I should stay?

59:26.859 --> 59:29.361
I think you should work it out a bit
in a song.

59:30.362 --> 59:31.780
And then see.

59:34.408 --> 59:36.159
I'll try.

59:39.121 --> 59:41.999
- So Dale let you just stay here?
- Yeah.

59:42.082 --> 59:44.918
Nobody was using it, so it's home now.

59:45.002 --> 59:46.170
It's awesome.

59:46.253 --> 59:49.131
- Are you hungry? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

59:49.214 --> 59:51.425
- Let's go get something to eat.
- Okay.

59:52.968 --> 59:55.679
I'm sorry I was so drunk the other night.

59:56.763 --> 59:57.764
Don't worry about it.

59:58.765 --> 1:00:00.684
Did I say anything embarrassing?

1:00:01.685 --> 1:00:04.104
Kind of but it's fine.

1:00:04.188 --> 1:00:06.773
We haven't even been friends that long.

1:00:07.774 --> 1:00:11.236
Long doesn't matter though, does it?

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:15.240
I don't know. To me, it's just intensity.

1:00:15.324 --> 1:00:17.618
I mean, a lot of shit happened.

1:00:23.373 --> 1:00:24.666
How's your mom doing?

1:00:25.667 --> 1:00:26.960
She's okay.

1:00:27.961 --> 1:00:30.839
I talked to her several times.
And to your cousin, Aleta.

1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:36.053
Thank you, but they're gonna boot her out.

1:00:39.389 --> 1:00:41.350
What are you gonna do?

1:00:41.433 --> 1:00:42.768
I can hide out,

1:00:42.851 --> 1:00:46.730
wait for them to renew DACA,
which hell knows how long that'll take.

1:00:46.813 --> 1:00:49.233
Or I can go to Manila with my mom.

1:00:49.316 --> 1:00:51.485
But I don't know which one.

1:00:52.569 --> 1:00:57.366
So you're just living day to day
without a plan?

1:00:57.449 --> 1:00:58.909
Yeah.

1:01:03.247 --> 1:01:04.373
Hey, Elliot?

1:01:05.374 --> 1:01:07.960
Do you think
your cousin would do me a big favor?

1:01:08.043 --> 1:01:10.295
- Yeah, of course.
- Great.

1:01:15.342 --> 1:01:18.303
We're looking for Priscilla Garcia.

1:01:18.387 --> 1:01:19.888
- <i>Hello?</i>
- One second.

1:01:20.889 --> 1:01:24.768
Could you send N-35, please? Thank you.

1:01:25.769 --> 1:01:26.603
Come on.

1:01:26.687 --> 1:01:30.482
- Just have a seat, she'll be right in.
- Thank you.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:07.394
Ma!

1:02:09.521 --> 1:02:11.523
No contact.

1:02:17.696 --> 1:02:20.157
I didn't even know you were coming.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.744
Hi. I'm Aleta Peacock.
I'm an immigration lawyer.

1:02:23.827 --> 1:02:27.539
This is Elliot's cousin, Ma.
She's not like the others. She'll help.

1:02:27.623 --> 1:02:29.499
And I really do hope that I can help.

1:02:29.583 --> 1:02:33.545
- Thank you for coming here with Rose.
- Of course.

1:02:37.508 --> 1:02:39.801
Have you thought about
what I said on the phone?

1:02:41.136 --> 1:02:43.096
I'm trying, Ma.

1:02:44.515 --> 1:02:46.892
I know it's not easy,

1:02:47.893 --> 1:02:50.229
but this is the best we can do for now.

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:55.192
I know you love Texas.

1:02:56.193 --> 1:02:58.070
I'm sorry.

1:02:59.571 --> 1:03:01.657
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1:03:04.785 --> 1:03:06.161
How is it here?

1:03:09.456 --> 1:03:12.334
It's okay. You can speak.

1:03:16.213 --> 1:03:18.715
They take everything away.

1:03:20.133 --> 1:03:22.970
We're treated like criminals here.

1:03:24.096 --> 1:03:28.267
I don't even have a name anymore.
I'm just N-35.

1:03:28.350 --> 1:03:29.726
It's not right.

1:03:29.810 --> 1:03:31.562
How is this even possible?

1:03:31.645 --> 1:03:33.605
The women I've met here,

1:03:33.689 --> 1:03:36.191
they work so hard.

1:03:37.192 --> 1:03:41.029
They've sacrificed so much
just to be here, like us.

1:03:43.532 --> 1:03:45.033
I was so scared.

1:03:45.117 --> 1:03:47.703
Ma, I'm so sorry.

1:03:47.786 --> 1:03:51.206
I've been so selfish,
thinking I could make it on my own.

1:03:51.290 --> 1:03:52.916
Time.

1:03:54.334 --> 1:03:56.211
We're not done yet.

1:03:57.212 --> 1:03:58.630
Time.

1:04:11.143 --> 1:04:12.936
Hey, kid.

1:04:14.521 --> 1:04:16.190
Where you been?

1:04:18.567 --> 1:04:20.527
Where you going with that?

1:04:20.611 --> 1:04:22.279
Hey!

1:04:24.948 --> 1:04:25.949
Hey.

1:04:26.033 --> 1:04:28.827
We're gonna need clarity.
You and I are gonna write some songs.

1:04:28.911 --> 1:04:33.165
I got some shit to express.
Take your damn guitar. Here.

1:04:33.248 --> 1:04:34.583
All right.

1:04:34.666 --> 1:04:38.128
- Damn straight. Let's do it.
- Just play some chords.

1:04:38.212 --> 1:04:41.381
- Can I do a melody I've been working on?
- Yeah.

1:04:54.853 --> 1:04:57.689
<i>Just stay quiet...</i>

1:05:06.949 --> 1:05:10.369
<i>I try, try, try</i>

1:05:11.370 --> 1:05:15.040
<i>No matter what I do</i>

1:05:16.708 --> 1:05:20.546
<i>That don't change my circumstance</i>

1:05:24.174 --> 1:05:28.095
<i>And I cry and cry and cry</i>

1:05:29.596 --> 1:05:31.515
<i>But life is waterproof</i>

1:05:31.598 --> 1:05:32.933
Yeah.

1:05:33.934 --> 1:05:37.396
<i>This skin I'm livin' in</i>

1:05:38.605 --> 1:05:43.610
<i>Don't feel at home to me</i>

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:50.534
<i>That don't change my circumstance</i>

1:05:54.121 --> 1:05:59.710
<i>That don't change my circumstance</i>

1:06:14.099 --> 1:06:15.225
Summer's ending.

1:06:16.226 --> 1:06:18.228
Feel that tiny chill?

1:06:20.063 --> 1:06:21.732
I don't feel a tiny chill.

1:06:22.816 --> 1:06:24.443
You wouldn't.

1:06:25.444 --> 1:06:27.070
You got school coming soon.

1:06:29.781 --> 1:06:34.119
Yeah. My school's, like, an hour away.
I should probably do something about that.

1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:37.122
I reckon you should.

1:06:38.123 --> 1:06:44.129
Right now, I wanna focus on doing a demo
that actually has good songs on it.

1:06:44.213 --> 1:06:46.673
Because it's the one thing
I know how to do.

1:06:46.757 --> 1:06:48.133
Okay.

1:06:49.176 --> 1:06:52.679
But if you're too scared
to perform them songs,

1:06:52.763 --> 1:06:53.972
ain't gonna do no good.

1:06:59.353 --> 1:07:01.980
I fell in love with country music
when I was a little girl.

1:07:02.981 --> 1:07:05.609
I played a song once at a talent show,

1:07:05.692 --> 1:07:08.070
and that's when they started
calling me "Yellow Rose."

1:07:08.153 --> 1:07:09.905
That's not funny.

1:07:11.698 --> 1:07:15.035
It's just, you're good, Rose.
You're really good.

1:07:18.789 --> 1:07:19.957
I'm gonna get a beer.

1:07:20.958 --> 1:07:23.043
It's, like, 10 in the morning.

1:07:23.126 --> 1:07:24.711
- So what?
- All right.

1:07:31.802 --> 1:07:34.471
Hey, thank y'all for coming
to chickenshit bingo.

1:07:34.555 --> 1:07:37.599
Free hot dogs. Not any dog.
The best dogs in the land.

1:07:37.683 --> 1:07:40.143
So as you can see,
I don't have a band here today,

1:07:40.227 --> 1:07:42.896
and it's because I wanna do
some new songs.

1:07:42.980 --> 1:07:46.400
I hope you like them
as much as I've learned from them.

1:07:46.483 --> 1:07:49.820
And the lady that helped me
learn from them is out there.

1:07:49.903 --> 1:07:53.448
I'd like her to get up and sing with me.
Put your hands together for Rose Garcia.

1:07:53.532 --> 1:07:54.533
Come on, Rose.

1:08:05.502 --> 1:08:07.129
You need a hat.

1:08:07.212 --> 1:08:08.797
Yeah, there you go.

1:08:08.881 --> 1:08:10.424
- "Circumstance"?
- Sure.

1:08:10.507 --> 1:08:13.051
Get close. Don't be shy.

1:08:15.971 --> 1:08:20.184
<i>I try, try, try</i>

1:08:20.267 --> 1:08:24.145
<i>No matter what I do</i>

1:08:25.772 --> 1:08:29.693
<i>It don't change my circumstance</i>

1:08:29.776 --> 1:08:31.486
There you go.

1:08:32.738 --> 1:08:36.867
<i>I cry, cry, cry</i>

1:08:36.950 --> 1:08:40.662
<i>But life is waterproof</i>

1:08:42.497 --> 1:08:47.627
<i>It don't change my circumstance</i>

1:08:49.755 --> 1:08:53.216
<i>Every move I make</i>

1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:57.595
<i>It's the same old groove</i>

1:08:57.679 --> 1:09:03.185
<i>And I'm stuck doing
The same old song and dance</i>

1:09:05.895 --> 1:09:10.108
<i>The skin I'm livin' in</i>

1:09:10.192 --> 1:09:14.529
<i>Don't feel like home to me</i>

1:09:15.613 --> 1:09:21.370
<i>It don't change my circumstance</i>

1:09:29.962 --> 1:09:31.212
Rose Garcia.

1:09:31.296 --> 1:09:34.550
All right, Rose! Good job.

1:09:36.844 --> 1:09:39.054
- Okay, is that a good height?
- Yeah.

1:09:39.136 --> 1:09:41.473
Yeah? All right, sit down.
Let's get you adjusted here.

1:09:42.474 --> 1:09:44.100
All right.

1:09:45.352 --> 1:09:48.188
All right. This is in case you spit.

1:09:48.272 --> 1:09:50.566
- Try not to spit.
- I'll try not to.

1:09:50.649 --> 1:09:52.234
All right.

1:09:53.484 --> 1:09:55.529
You gonna slouch like that? Okay, just...

1:09:55.612 --> 1:09:57.489
- No.
- Okay.

1:09:58.490 --> 1:09:59.908
- All right.
- I'm nervous.

1:09:59.992 --> 1:10:02.578
I get you. I get you.
You're gonna do great.

1:10:02.661 --> 1:10:04.246
You're gonna do great.

1:10:04.329 --> 1:10:05.330
All right.

1:10:05.414 --> 1:10:09.126
- Just close your eyes, go for it.
- Okay.

1:10:09.209 --> 1:10:10.627
- You'll be great.
- Thanks, Dale.

1:10:17.176 --> 1:10:20.637
<i>I never fit in</i>

1:10:22.431 --> 1:10:25.642
<i>Never could win</i>

1:10:28.437 --> 1:10:32.858
<i>Though I tried and tried</i>

1:10:32.941 --> 1:10:37.070
<i>This feeling don't end</i>

1:10:38.822 --> 1:10:43.035
<i>I feel out of place</i>

1:10:44.328 --> 1:10:48.415
<i>A song out of tune</i>

1:10:50.542 --> 1:10:55.088
<i>Like a velvet chair</i>

1:10:55.172 --> 1:10:59.510
<i>In a dusty saloon</i>

1:11:02.596 --> 1:11:07.059
<i>Square peg</i>

1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:13.232
<i>Round hole</i>

1:11:13.315 --> 1:11:17.569
<i>A runaway</i>

1:11:17.653 --> 1:11:20.364
<i>With nowhere to go</i>

1:11:24.243 --> 1:11:28.497
<i>Square peg</i>

1:11:29.790 --> 1:11:35.170
<i>Round hole</i>

1:11:41.134 --> 1:11:45.347
<i>We never said the words goodbye</i>

1:11:45.430 --> 1:11:48.100
<i>And all those nights I would cry</i>

1:11:49.768 --> 1:11:54.106
<i>Still, no matter how far we're apart</i>

1:11:54.189 --> 1:11:57.943
<i>You'll always be here in my heart</i>

1:11:58.026 --> 1:12:00.612
<i>They can take the roof</i>

1:12:00.696 --> 1:12:02.823
<i>From over my head</i>

1:12:02.906 --> 1:12:05.868
<i>But they can't take my freedom away</i>

1:12:06.869 --> 1:12:11.373
<i>No, I won't go quietly into the night</i>

1:12:11.456 --> 1:12:14.960
<i>And I'll sing till the light of day</i>

1:12:15.043 --> 1:12:17.588
<i>They can take the roof</i>

1:12:17.671 --> 1:12:19.756
<i>From over my head</i>

1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:22.926
<i>But they can't take my freedom away</i>

1:12:23.927 --> 1:12:28.140
<i>No, I won't go quietly into the night</i>

1:12:28.223 --> 1:12:31.977
<i>And I'll sing till the light of day</i>

1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:36.565
<i>No, I won't go quietly into the night</i>

1:12:36.648 --> 1:12:41.612
<i>And I'll sing till the light of day</i>

1:12:46.742 --> 1:12:51.413
<i>P.R. Flight 476 to Manila
leaving Dallas Control. Thank you.</i>

1:13:04.927 --> 1:13:07.638
- Well, good morning.
- Morning.

1:13:11.266 --> 1:13:14.520
- Is that yours?
- No.

1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:21.735
I figured you needed a new one.
To celebrate.

1:13:22.778 --> 1:13:24.071
Finishing the demo.

1:13:25.072 --> 1:13:27.157
Mighty proud of you, Rose.

1:13:29.201 --> 1:13:31.495
You know my dad got me my first guitar?

1:13:32.496 --> 1:13:36.208
Yeah, I know, but it's beat up and old.

1:13:37.209 --> 1:13:38.877
Try her out.

1:13:45.050 --> 1:13:46.510
Wow, it's gorgeous.

1:13:47.511 --> 1:13:48.804
Suits you.

1:13:50.138 --> 1:13:53.851
We make a pretty good pair,
you and me. You think?

1:13:54.935 --> 1:13:57.396
Yeah. I reckon.

1:13:59.022 --> 1:14:01.066
So my Ma's gone for good.

1:14:02.067 --> 1:14:07.614
And my <i>tita...</i> Well, really my uncle,
doesn't want me around either.

1:14:07.698 --> 1:14:09.992
So I was wondering

1:14:10.075 --> 1:14:12.619
if I could stay a bit longer.

1:14:13.620 --> 1:14:16.039
My lawyer said if an adult...

1:14:17.624 --> 1:14:19.042
or you,

1:14:19.126 --> 1:14:21.837
- could sign some papers...
- Wait, Rose.

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:23.172
Look, honey.

1:14:23.255 --> 1:14:25.966
I'm sorry.
I thought this was just temporary.

1:14:27.134 --> 1:14:30.012
I can't be your father,
if that's what you're asking.

1:14:30.095 --> 1:14:31.305
I mean, I...

1:14:32.306 --> 1:14:34.933
I was barely a father to my own kids.

1:14:35.017 --> 1:14:38.687
I gotta get my stuff straight
before I could help anybody else.

1:14:40.355 --> 1:14:42.524
You understand that, don't you?

1:14:44.651 --> 1:14:47.029
So why do you even want me around?

1:14:48.030 --> 1:14:49.698
That's not fair.

1:14:50.699 --> 1:14:53.994
Does it make you feel better
about yourself, helping out an illegal?

1:14:54.077 --> 1:14:57.456
Oh, yeah. I'm probably
some shitty low-rent muse...

1:14:57.539 --> 1:14:58.624
Rose. Rose.

1:14:58.707 --> 1:15:01.627
A penance for all your shitty
relationships and bad decisions in life.

1:15:01.710 --> 1:15:04.546
- Well, I have my own life, so...
- Just calm down.

1:15:04.630 --> 1:15:08.133
Rose. Come back here, please. Rose.

1:15:09.843 --> 1:15:11.845
Rose, would you please stop?

1:15:12.846 --> 1:15:14.556
Rose!

1:15:20.729 --> 1:15:22.814
Will you talk to me?

1:19:20.761 --> 1:19:21.845
Hey, Ma!

1:19:21.929 --> 1:19:24.723
<i>Hi,</i> hija. <i>How are you?</i>

1:19:24.806 --> 1:19:27.601
I'm okay. How are you?

1:19:29.019 --> 1:19:30.771
<i>I'm good.</i>

1:19:30.854 --> 1:19:32.981
<i>I still don't like that you're there.</i>

1:19:33.982 --> 1:19:36.026
- Well...
- <i>Are you...?</i>

1:19:37.152 --> 1:19:39.613
<i>Are you working on your GED?</i>

1:19:40.864 --> 1:19:43.951
Every day. So much fun.

1:19:46.328 --> 1:19:47.704
<i>I miss you.</i>

1:19:48.705 --> 1:19:50.624
I miss you too.

1:19:53.502 --> 1:19:57.381
<i>Your cousins listen
to your song every day.</i>

1:19:57.464 --> 1:19:59.132
<i>Are you gonna make some more?</i>

1:20:00.133 --> 1:20:01.927
Oh, well...

1:20:02.928 --> 1:20:05.013
I'm not really playing anymore, Ma.

1:20:05.097 --> 1:20:06.139
I had to...

1:20:07.140 --> 1:20:09.017
I had to sell my guitar.

1:20:10.018 --> 1:20:11.436
<i>Why?</i>

1:20:15.899 --> 1:20:17.526
Ma...

1:20:19.236 --> 1:20:21.488
<i>What's wrong,</i> anak?

1:20:23.031 --> 1:20:25.617
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Rose.</i>

1:20:28.662 --> 1:20:30.831
<i>Oh, Rose. Don't cry.</i>

1:20:31.832 --> 1:20:33.834
Ma, I don't know what I'm doing.

1:20:34.835 --> 1:20:38.338
This is so hard. I miss you so much.

1:20:40.090 --> 1:20:44.052
I don't know how much longer
I can do this by myself.

1:20:45.053 --> 1:20:50.225
<i>I just hate it
that I can't be there for you.</i>

1:20:51.226 --> 1:20:53.437
<i>It's my fault. I should've done more.</i>

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:55.063
It's not your fault.

1:20:55.147 --> 1:20:57.316
It's not your fault.

1:21:03.405 --> 1:21:05.073
<i>Why don't you come home?</i>

1:21:06.074 --> 1:21:08.076
I'm sorry.

1:21:09.077 --> 1:21:11.330
This is home for me.

1:21:17.669 --> 1:21:19.671
Don't cry, Ma.

1:21:45.113 --> 1:21:47.157
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

1:21:48.158 --> 1:21:51.954
I promise you, Ma, I'll be okay.

1:21:55.165 --> 1:21:57.334
Can I call you tomorrow?

1:21:58.627 --> 1:22:00.629
<i>Yeah. I'll be waiting.</i>

1:22:00.712 --> 1:22:03.841
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

1:22:05.425 --> 1:22:07.135
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye, Ma.

1:22:31.702 --> 1:22:33.871
<i>Got a Cadillac...</i>

1:22:41.753 --> 1:22:44.006
You are a sight for sore eyes.

1:22:44.089 --> 1:22:47.843
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1:22:48.844 --> 1:22:50.470
So how are you doing?

1:22:50.554 --> 1:22:52.055
I'm all right.

1:22:52.139 --> 1:22:54.600
I heard your new song on the radio.
It's really good.

1:22:54.683 --> 1:22:56.268
Thanks.

1:22:56.351 --> 1:23:00.480
Look, Rose, I'm really sorry about
what happened that night.

1:23:01.940 --> 1:23:03.901
It's fine. I've forgotten.

1:23:07.738 --> 1:23:09.948
Well, what are you doing?

1:23:10.949 --> 1:23:13.368
I got a job, a room.

1:23:13.452 --> 1:23:15.871
It's not much, but I guess it's home.

1:23:15.954 --> 1:23:17.831
And what about music?

1:23:19.374 --> 1:23:21.001
I've been writing.

1:23:21.084 --> 1:23:22.628
In fact, I was...

1:23:22.711 --> 1:23:26.298
I wanted to ask if it was okay with you
that you help me with this new song.

1:23:26.381 --> 1:23:28.175
I think it's pretty good.

1:23:28.258 --> 1:23:29.343
Well, of course.

1:23:30.594 --> 1:23:32.179
Wait right here.

1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:35.390
You left something behind.

1:23:41.813 --> 1:23:44.233
Remember her? She missed you.

1:23:47.444 --> 1:23:48.695
Thanks, Dale.

1:23:49.696 --> 1:23:50.531
Well...

1:23:51.740 --> 1:23:53.200
Let's hear it.

1:25:43.519 --> 1:25:45.479
- Elliot.
- What the hell?

1:25:45.562 --> 1:25:48.190
I've been trying to call you and text you,
and I got nothing.

1:25:48.273 --> 1:25:50.275
- Sorry.
- You're sorry?

1:25:50.359 --> 1:25:52.778
I was worried sick.
I didn't know if anything happened to you.

1:25:52.861 --> 1:25:55.280
I'm fine, okay? I'm sorry.
I should've called you.

1:25:55.364 --> 1:25:58.283
I needed time, Elliot,
to figure my shit out.

1:25:58.367 --> 1:25:59.952
Yeah, well...

1:26:00.953 --> 1:26:03.997
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, no problem.

1:26:05.082 --> 1:26:06.416
You look great.

1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:09.086
- Thanks.
- Where's your lasso?

1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:11.588
Cool, cool. Yeah.

1:26:11.672 --> 1:26:14.258
I went to get this at a thrift shop
and thought it'd be cool.

1:26:14.341 --> 1:26:16.343
- Apparently, I was wrong.
- They were probably having a sale.

1:26:16.426 --> 1:26:18.512
- Yeah. Yeah, they were.
- Yeah?

1:26:18.595 --> 1:26:21.265
- Good choice. Good choice.
- You look great.

1:26:21.348 --> 1:26:24.268
- Thanks. You too.
- Thanks.

1:26:26.270 --> 1:26:29.523
- Are you gonna stay and watch the show?
- Yeah.

1:26:29.606 --> 1:26:31.775
Cool. So I'll see you after.

1:26:31.859 --> 1:26:33.819
- Yeah, see you after.
- Okay.

1:26:33.902 --> 1:26:35.279
Wait.

1:26:53.547 --> 1:26:54.381
Okay.

1:26:55.549 --> 1:26:57.885
- I gotta do the...
- Yeah.

1:26:57.968 --> 1:26:59.970
- See you later?
- Yeah. I'll see you after.

1:27:00.971 --> 1:27:04.099
<i>I look into your face</i>

1:27:04.183 --> 1:27:10.564
<i>And I see, mama, you smile</i>

1:27:11.565 --> 1:27:14.943
<i>Every time, mama</i>

1:27:15.944 --> 1:27:18.572
<i>You smile</i>

1:27:25.579 --> 1:27:27.414
Thank y'all.

1:27:27.497 --> 1:27:30.709
I sure appreciate y'all being here
this exciting night.

1:27:30.792 --> 1:27:34.296
I tell you, this is the first showcase
of a dear friend of mine.

1:27:34.379 --> 1:27:39.051
She's a great writer and a great singer,
and I know you're gonna enjoy it.

1:27:39.134 --> 1:27:41.595
A big hand for Rose Garcia.

1:27:51.813 --> 1:27:54.441
Hey, y'all. My name's Rose.

1:27:55.442 --> 1:27:56.985
Ma, this is for you.

1:27:58.654 --> 1:28:00.697
One, two, and...

1:28:08.038 --> 1:28:11.583
<i>You won't get the best of me</i>

1:28:11.667 --> 1:28:15.128
<i>You ain't seen the last of me</i>

1:28:15.212 --> 1:28:21.802
<i>I may go, but I'll come back around</i>

1:28:22.803 --> 1:28:26.765
<i>You can give me your best shot</i>

1:28:26.849 --> 1:28:30.143

1:28:45.576 --> 1:28:49.830

Keep standing proud</i>

1:28:50.831 --> 1:28:54.042
<i>Been to the school of hard knocks</i>

1:28:54.126 --> 1:28:56.253
<i>They say I've been around the block</i>

1:28:56.336 --> 1:28:57.880
