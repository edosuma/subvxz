SELINA: <i>Congresswoman Nickerson,
I just want you to know</i>

00:08.021 --> 00:09.588
that I won't forget my
friends in Congress.

00:09.589 --> 00:11.156
These are fabulous.

00:11.157 --> 00:13.158
- Wow.
- Her people say she wants the mug.

00:13.159 --> 00:17.395
Would you like to keep the
mugs for your... minivan?

00:17.396 --> 00:19.063
How did you know I have a minivan?

00:19.064 --> 00:21.732
- Just a good guess.
- (LAUGHS)

00:21.733 --> 00:25.236
Before I ran for Congress, I was
a stay-at-home mother of six.

00:25.237 --> 00:27.237
Ugh, yeah.

00:27.238 --> 00:30.440
I tell you, if I could not get there
in a minivan, then I wasn't going.

00:30.441 --> 00:32.375
- Right.
- You know the drill.

00:32.375 --> 00:33.877
Indeed I do, yeah.

00:33.878 --> 00:36.011
I mean, my license
expired a few years ago,

00:36.012 --> 00:37.746
but I get the general idea.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.281
So, Penny. Penny.

00:39.282 --> 00:43.985
We want to reauthorize the
amphibious fighting boat

00:43.986 --> 00:48.556
and have them built in your district.

00:48.557 --> 00:52.393
I saw a blanket out front that
said Air Force One on it.

00:52.394 --> 00:53.794
It looks really beautiful.

00:53.795 --> 00:55.462
Let's get one of our care packages

00:55.463 --> 00:57.397
and then we can throw one
of those blankets in there.

00:57.398 --> 00:59.066
- With the throw pillows?
- Yeah.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.135
So what do you think? Can
I count on your support?

01:01.136 --> 01:02.835
Okey-dokey, Annie Oakley.

01:02.836 --> 01:05.605
- Bless your pea-picking heart.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

01:05.606 --> 01:07.907
Would you like to call
someone from Air Force One?

01:07.908 --> 01:10.376
- That usually freaks people out.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:10.377 --> 01:12.210
My Donald. He has chemo today.

01:12.211 --> 01:13.712

Mike, the navy doesn't even want the
amphibious fighting boat anymore.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.230
<i>Is it a coincidence that the plant</i>

02:11.231 --> 02:14.132

Nickerson's district?

02:14.133 --> 02:17.802
Jim, if our nation's enemies decide
to drop the puck on hostilities,

02:17.803 --> 02:20.071
then our navy and our
allies will be very glad

02:20.072 --> 02:22.106
we have the military
capabilities we need.

02:22.107 --> 02:25.375
- Drop the puck?
- Common hockey term. Uh, Donna.

Mike, question about the

That is the end of the third period.

- Mike! Mike!

02:33.350 --> 02:34.884
You know, with Nickerson's support,

02:34.885 --> 02:36.719
that clinches Colorado
for us four to three.

...the alleged birth date
of the prophet Muhammad.

02:45.127 --> 02:47.662
Well, I suppose putting a few pictures
up of Muhammad never hurt anyone.

02:47.663 --> 02:50.397
Ma'am, I'm getting a lot of
press interest about Catherine

02:50.398 --> 02:52.499

She's a lesbian, Mike.
She's not a werewolf.

02:54.769 --> 02:57.538
Although either one would explain
why she never shaves her legs.

- Yeah.

03:01.709 --> 03:04.811
When does the White House's most
useless press secretary list come out?

03:04.812 --> 03:06.346
I can't wait to see who's
number one this year.

03:06.347 --> 03:08.513
- I voted for Mike.
- AMY: I hate that thing.

This year? It's the 50
Hottest Staffers, Jonah,

03:42.045 --> 03:44.712
not the 50 people most likely to
kill themselves before trial.

03:44.713 --> 03:47.882

03:52.820 --> 03:55.889
The whole point of the 50

- <i> You're number 26, Mr. Egan.</i>
- Yeah, five years in a row now.

03:58.359 --> 04:00.460
It's to use it to learn who to fuck.

04:00.461 --> 04:01.035
Who?

04:01.036 --> 04:02.762
Find a woman who was on it
last year, but not this year.

her pay for dinner" situation.

Tom, you'll be in charge

And once you're all done
with them, I'll move in

04:46.935 --> 04:49.103
and squirt a half gallon of ropey jism

04:49.104 --> 04:51.572

05:04.451 --> 05:06.826

tomorrow night, right, Tom?

05:06.827 --> 05:07.753

05:20.733 --> 05:22.332
So?

05:22.333 --> 05:24.501
What the fuck is Tom up to?

05:24.502 --> 05:26.970
Why was he meeting with Purcell
at a Korean barbecue place?

05:26.971 --> 05:29.940
- Marwood is the opposition.
- You think Tom is helping O'Brien?

05:29.941 --> 05:33.175
But what could O'Brien offer him that's
better than the vice presidency?

05:33.176 --> 05:34.710
Literally anything.

05:34.711 --> 05:38.214
Oh! Tom wanted Secretary
of the Treasury.

05:38.215 --> 05:40.782
I said no. Ah, fuck!

05:40.783 --> 05:43.284

nailing down those votes.

eye on Tom tomorrow night.

05:48.624 --> 05:50.590
- Really.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:01.034 --> 06:03.636
- Yes?
- I was just checking

06:03.637 --> 06:05.904
to see if there was
another meeting about me.

06:07.074 --> 06:08.272
Not today.

question is for Mr. Ryan.</i>

06:12.311 --> 06:14.479
Would you vote to raise
the debt ceiling?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.814
Well, as the late, great
Lionel Richie once said,

06:16.815 --> 06:20.418
"Oh, what a feeling, I am
dancing on the debt ceiling."

06:20.419 --> 06:22.920
OKAY, A: Lionel Richie is not dead,

06:22.921 --> 06:25.089
AND B: what the fuck
does that even mean?

06:25.090 --> 06:26.556
New Hampshire loves my zingers.

06:26.557 --> 06:29.292
It's my personality that
has gotten us this far.

06:29.293 --> 06:32.495
No, I am the one who got us this far,

06:32.496 --> 06:34.097
you sentient enema.

06:34.098 --> 06:35.597
All right, Mrs. Sherman, same question.

06:35.598 --> 06:37.733
I hereby solemnly promise to never vote

06:37.734 --> 06:40.235
to raise the debt ceiling
without budgetary offsets.

06:40.236 --> 06:42.371

grocery budget every week.

- What was your name again?
- Judy Sherman.

06:48.243 --> 06:50.845
Oh, come on, Richard's only
winning because he gets to be

06:50.846 --> 06:52.646
the easier person and I have to be me.

06:52.647 --> 06:54.514
All right, Judy, pretend to be Jonah.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.750
Richard's not gonna get the
subtleties of being...

06:56.751 --> 07:00.086

07:00.087 --> 07:03.355
I'd have to agree with Mrs. Sherman
here on fiscal responsibility.

07:03.356 --> 07:07.960
In fact, teacher, allow me to
present you with this apple.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.296
Feel my dick. I am rock-hard
for you right now, mister.

07:11.297 --> 07:12.564

Local news stations are running
footage from the rally.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.403
- You said Brattleboro.
- So?

07:19.404 --> 07:21.977
So Brattleboro just
happens to be in Vermont.

07:21.978 --> 07:22.940
Since when?

07:22.941 --> 07:26.743
Granted, every town up here is just two dirty
piles of snow connected by a covered bridge,

07:26.744 --> 07:29.779
but Jesus Christ, Jonah, you grew up
here. How do you not know this shit?

07:29.780 --> 07:32.148
I don't know. Maybe I was supposed
to learn it in the second grade,

07:32.149 --> 07:33.783
but my teacher was a fucking bitch.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.284
Jonah, watch your language.

07:35.285 --> 07:37.385
Well, obviously Ericsson
had trackers at the event.

07:37.386 --> 07:39.136
Richard, who do we
have tracking the widow?

07:39.137 --> 07:39.788
Nobody.

07:39.789 --> 07:44.359
Then go out there and buy a camera
and videotape everything she does.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.794
- Do you want 4k or 1080p?
- Just buy any fucking camera.

07:46.795 --> 07:48.662
- Okay, I'm going.
- You and I have to talk.

07:48.663 --> 07:50.931
If you were like 10% less black,

07:50.932 --> 07:52.933

We talked about this. The wife of
Congressman Platt designed it.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.542
Does she know I'm not
the president of Cuba?

08:02.543 --> 08:05.577
Did you tell her that?
Are you wearing cologne?

Hi, Marjorie. Don't you look...

08:15.521 --> 08:17.522
- Strapping.
- ...strapping.

08:17.523 --> 08:18.294
Thank you, ma'am.

08:18.295 --> 08:20.525
What's happening with
these tentacles here?

08:20.526 --> 08:23.760
Are they gonna get put
away or something?

08:23.761 --> 08:26.630
I have a question. I
need to know how you...

08:26.631 --> 08:29.332
gals want to play the whole gay thing.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.411
I'm sorry, I don't know...

08:30.412 --> 08:32.433
Mike has been getting
a bunch of questions

08:32.434 --> 08:34.970
and interview requests and, you
know, et cetera, et cetera.

08:34.971 --> 08:37.206
And I just don't know how
you want to handle that.

08:37.207 --> 08:40.909
Do you want to just play it like Ellen or
do you want to be more like Jodie Foster?

08:40.909 --> 08:43.010
Do you want to play it
more like a mystery?

08:43.011 --> 08:47.549
Uh, I think that we were kind of hoping
that we could keep things on the down-low.

08:47.550 --> 08:49.683
Okay, can you just speak
English, Catherine?

08:49.684 --> 08:51.218
'Cause I don't know what
you're trying to say.

08:51.219 --> 08:53.120
Madam President, if it's
all the same to you,

08:53.121 --> 08:56.056
we don't want our private
life to be politicized.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.758
Okay. I get that. I respect that.

08:58.759 --> 09:00.526
We'll keep it under the gaydar.

09:00.527 --> 09:02.794
- Thank you.
- So, great. I'll tell Mike.

09:04.531 --> 09:06.365
- MAN: <i> Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Here, take it.

09:06.366 --> 09:08.433
-<i> ...the President of the United States.</i>
- Thank you.

09:08.434 --> 09:11.169
Thank... (GASPS) would
you listen to this?

09:11.170 --> 09:14.072
- (HARMONIZING)
- Who doesn't love a cappella, right?

09:14.073 --> 09:17.808
It's like a magic trick 'cause there
are no instruments, of course.

09:17.809 --> 09:20.477
Madam President, Tom James, 8:00.

09:20.478 --> 09:22.445
Okay.

09:24.616 --> 09:27.584
You mean 11:00? Over there?

09:27.585 --> 09:30.086
Seriously, can you really not tell time?

09:30.087 --> 09:32.555
Sorry, ma'am, I just
thought it meant close.

09:32.556 --> 09:33.756
- Ma'am?
- Yes.

09:33.757 --> 09:34.957
The fluffers have done their work.

09:34.958 --> 09:36.358
It's time for the orgy to begin.

09:36.359 --> 09:38.293
Okay, let's get that done.

09:38.294 --> 09:41.363
Oh, look, Catherine. You fixed
that there, didn't you?

09:41.364 --> 09:42.263
Yeah.

09:42.264 --> 09:44.966
Except it's still just a
rat's nest in the back.

09:44.967 --> 09:47.802
It needs to pull... maybe
you can help her, Marjorie.

09:47.803 --> 09:49.470
<i>Just pull it back, sweetheart.</i>

09:49.471 --> 09:52.105
Oh, all my friends are here.

09:52.106 --> 09:54.174
- Madam President, hello.
- Merry Christmas.

09:54.175 --> 09:56.610
- Thank you so much for having us.
- Hello, Congressman Jaeger.

09:56.611 --> 09:58.878
- And this must be Mrs. Jaeger?
- That's not his wife.

09:58.879 --> 10:00.879
- Okay.
- This is one of my staffers, Nadia.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.848
- She's a prostitute.
- Hmm.

10:02.849 --> 10:06.685
Well, would you like a picture for
your friends and for your family?

10:06.686 --> 10:08.387
- Yes...
- We've got a...

10:08.388 --> 10:10.555
There we go. No.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.757
And I want to wish you
a merry Christmas.

10:12.758 --> 10:14.284
And I can count on
your support, can't I?

10:14.285 --> 10:15.326
100%. Merry Christmas.

10:15.327 --> 10:16.995
- Wonderful, thank you.
- And Happy New Year. Nadia, let's go.

10:16.996 --> 10:18.596
This is Congressman Baines from Arizona.

10:18.597 --> 10:19.930
He's solidly O'Brien.

10:19.931 --> 10:23.400
Oh, let's get a picture. There we go.

10:23.401 --> 10:26.203
And you're out of here. You can go.

10:26.204 --> 10:28.404
Catherine's 23 years old.
She's fair game.

10:28.405 --> 10:30.773
Maybe you ride the pine on
this one for a period or two.

10:30.774 --> 10:33.809
- Please?
- All right, I'll talk to everyone.

10:33.810 --> 10:36.178
- I owe you.
- I mean, I'd hate to be offsides.

10:36.179 --> 10:38.613
- What?
- You know, hockey.

10:38.614 --> 10:41.583
Hockey. Great sport. Thank you.

10:41.584 --> 10:43.885
Mike, are you dating a
hockey player by any chance?

10:43.886 --> 10:47.054
You noticed the hockey references?
Shit, I thought they were seamless.

10:47.055 --> 10:50.524
Listen, you can't say a word,
but our surrogate is pregnant

10:50.525 --> 10:52.559
and I've been talking
to somebody in the NHL

10:52.560 --> 10:55.128
about a job as director
of communications.

10:55.129 --> 10:58.531
So win or lose, I'm out of here.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.800
Well, let me get my good-byes
out of the way now.

11:00.801 --> 11:04.202
Congressman, the president would love to
have a clutch with you in the Green Room.

11:04.203 --> 11:06.038
- Oh, of course.
- Great.

11:06.039 --> 11:07.939
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:07.940 --> 11:09.541
Carson City, Nevada.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.343
Ah, Buddy Calhoun

11:11.344 --> 11:12.843
in a tie that's not made out of string.

11:12.844 --> 11:14.311
You're the only woman
who's ever threatened

11:14.312 --> 11:16.414
to grate my balls over
a bowl of spaghetti.

11:16.415 --> 11:19.617
- Night's still young. Knock yourself out.
- Well, yeah.

11:19.618 --> 11:24.754
Madam President, we are looking to
build a 9/11 memorial in Bozeman.

11:24.755 --> 11:27.157
That sounds superb.

11:27.158 --> 11:29.259
Wonderful, because, you
know, never forget.

11:29.260 --> 11:30.626
- That's right.
- Always remember.

11:30.627 --> 11:32.895
But can you remind me
exactly what happened

11:32.896 --> 11:34.930
in Bozeman on 9/11?

11:34.931 --> 11:37.833
This is mainly focused
on our first responders.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.268
Oh, that's so important.

11:39.269 --> 11:41.669
Our first responders were
terribly traumatized

11:41.670 --> 11:44.572
by what happened to the first
responders in New York.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.008
Yeah, I get that. That's, uh...

11:47.009 --> 11:49.810
- Wow.
- That's... wow. Yeah, Ben.

11:49.811 --> 11:51.745
You know, I am sure there
is a little something

11:51.746 --> 11:55.148
we can find somewhere for
such a great project, sir.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.717
Roger, what do you think?

11:56.718 --> 11:58.584
Oh, I'm sure we can just
slip it under the skirt

11:58.585 --> 12:01.020
of the Homeland Security budget.
Tell him why, Will.

12:01.021 --> 12:05.658
The budget has a fatter, more
womanly behind than myself.

12:05.659 --> 12:07.959
Excuse me. Aren't you Gary Walsh?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.228
- What did I do?
- You've got to come meet my daughter.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.197
- She saw you in "The Hill."
- Oh.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.799
She's single, divorced, has a kid.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.334
- But he's really a sweetheart.
- Oh, how nice.

12:17.335 --> 12:19.536
God, I feel like somebody's
playing a trick on him.

12:19.537 --> 12:22.539
They're about to dump a bucket
of pig's blood on his head.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.241
<i>- (MUSIC PLAYING)
- (CHATTER)</i>

12:24.242 --> 12:26.175
- You having a good time, Amy?
- Eh.

12:26.176 --> 12:28.644
Can't believe how many compliments
I'm getting about the hot list.

12:28.645 --> 12:29.161
(LAUGHS)

12:29.162 --> 12:30.713
Don't people around here
have anything better

12:30.714 --> 12:32.515
to talk about than the stupid hot list?

12:32.516 --> 12:34.750
- Amy, do you want some advice?
- Definitely not.

12:34.751 --> 12:37.886
Listen, don't worry so much
about what's up here, okay?

12:37.887 --> 12:40.622
Worry about what's in here.
And if you work at that,

12:40.623 --> 12:42.556
I'm telling you, you're gonna
be back on the hot list, Amy.

12:42.557 --> 12:45.092
I'm not saying you're
gonna be in the top 20,

12:45.093 --> 12:47.703
but you would be a
lock for, like, mid 40s.

12:47.704 --> 12:48.662
Thank you.

12:48.663 --> 12:53.566
Look at him, he's smiling like his
shit's all pine-fresh smelling.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.068
Oh, okay.

12:55.069 --> 12:56.603
- What are you doing?
- What?

12:56.604 --> 12:58.004
You're looking at
yourself in the mirror?

12:58.005 --> 13:01.273
- You look wonderful.
- Yeah.

13:01.274 --> 13:02.741
WOMAN: <i>Madam President.</i>

13:02.742 --> 13:04.476
This is Connie DiBenedetto of Oregon.

13:04.477 --> 13:06.378
She's the chairman of the
Gay and Lesbian Caucus.

13:06.379 --> 13:09.580
Actually, she's the only member
of the Gay and Lesbian Caucus.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.316
I'd like to take just
a moment of your time

13:12.317 --> 13:14.719
to talk to you about your
environmental policy.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.521
Oh, yes. Uh-huh.

13:16.522 --> 13:18.522
- I know it's politically risky...
- Come this way.

13:18.523 --> 13:21.358
...but, you know, a carbon
tax is the only way to go.

13:21.359 --> 13:23.226
- Yeah, you've met my daughter Catherine?
- No.

13:23.227 --> 13:25.395
And this is her special friend Marjorie.

13:25.396 --> 13:27.063
I want to get a picture of all of us.

13:27.064 --> 13:28.898
No, Mom, we don't want
to take any photos.

13:28.899 --> 13:30.900
Sure, we do. We're dying to do that.

13:30.901 --> 13:32.802
So, here we go right here.

13:32.803 --> 13:34.136
Let's all say girl power.

13:34.137 --> 13:35.905
- (LAUGHS) Girl power.
- Girl power.

13:35.906 --> 13:38.039
Listen, I wish I was hip enough
to hang here with you all,

13:38.040 --> 13:39.941
- but I've got to go deal with...
- You're a busy girl.

13:39.942 --> 13:41.876
- Tell Liz I love her.
- Oh, I will.

13:41.877 --> 13:43.978
- Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.
- She'll love that. Bye.

13:43.979 --> 13:47.247
♪ Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
a dreidel I will play... ♪

13:47.248 --> 13:49.550
- The Brandeis Chigh-notes.
- Hmm.

13:49.551 --> 13:51.718
Tonight we've got the
bowling alley appearance

13:51.719 --> 13:53.420
and we can't have any more gaffes.

13:53.421 --> 13:54.987
I got it! I got it!

13:54.988 --> 13:56.989
The widow saw me filming
her and she got mad.

13:56.990 --> 13:58.791
She called me some truly awful things.

13:58.792 --> 14:02.195
- Oh, thank you, Satan.
- I think this is a game changer.

14:02.196 --> 14:04.930
<i>(APPLAUSE)</i>

14:04.931 --> 14:06.997
JUDY: Thank you all so much for coming.

RICHARD: Oh, my God, I got it.
I think I got it!

14:11.938 --> 14:13.637
You know, I think I see
what happened there.

14:13.638 --> 14:15.673
Richard, you good boy. (LAUGHS)

14:15.674 --> 14:19.443
I went to turn it on, but it was
already on, so I turned it off.

14:19.444 --> 14:22.779
Then I went to turn it off, but it
already was off, so I turned it on.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.849
(SIGHS) I had such plans
for you, Richard.

14:25.850 --> 14:28.852
Congressman Baxter, I
completely believe you

14:28.853 --> 14:31.420
about the whole men's room incident.

14:31.421 --> 14:33.155
It sounded very plausible to me.

14:33.156 --> 14:35.090
So I want to also wish
you a merry Christmas.

14:35.091 --> 14:38.293
- Thank you so much.
- This is Paul Graves, purple state.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.628
- He could go either way.
- Like Baxter.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.664
I didn't know Jim Owens
was working for Graves.

14:43.665 --> 14:47.401
Yeah. Oh, man, that was
your one work friend.

14:47.402 --> 14:50.604
Yeah, he wouldn't return my
calls after POTUS fired him.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.405
Oh, come on. It's been a long time.
Go talk to him.

14:52.406 --> 14:54.107
- I can't. I can't.
- Mike.

14:54.108 --> 14:56.243
Madam President, everyone
knows I'm no fan of O'Brien,

14:56.244 --> 14:59.712
but if I'm gonna cross party lines
in order to hand you the presidency,

14:59.713 --> 15:01.380
<i>I'm gonna need something big.</i>

15:01.381 --> 15:02.748
Okay, how big?

15:02.749 --> 15:07.051
Why don't we go with Secretary of State?

15:07.052 --> 15:10.421
Well, at least we know you
don't need big balls.

15:10.422 --> 15:12.590
- Got large stones for sure.
- Right?

15:12.591 --> 15:15.525
I think it's something

15:15.526 --> 15:17.327
we might be able to accommodate.

15:17.328 --> 15:19.930
- Excellent. Then, Madam President...
- Yes?

15:19.931 --> 15:22.699
- ...you have my support.
- Oh, that's what I wanted to hear.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.234
Thank you so much, Congressman.

15:25.235 --> 15:28.037
Hey, enjoy the party, okay? Have fun.

15:28.038 --> 15:30.306
Ooh, we got Graves.

15:30.307 --> 15:33.075
- That was fantastic.
- I know it.

15:33.076 --> 15:35.543
Oh, what about Doyle?
You promised him State.

15:35.544 --> 15:38.146
- He knows I don't keep my promises.
- He should know by now.

15:38.147 --> 15:41.149
Oh, I love your district.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.217
And I love your district.

15:43.218 --> 15:45.552
I love them both. (LAUGHS)

15:45.553 --> 15:46.987
- FURLONG: Hey, where have you been?
- What?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.656
Turns out Nickerson
is back on the fence.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.524
She said she never fully agreed
to endorse you or support you.

15:51.525 --> 15:54.794
And I said maybe you'd remember better if
I fuck your brain through your ear hole.

15:54.795 --> 15:57.096
- Then what did she say, Will?
- She's pretty furious about it, sir.

15:57.097 --> 15:59.866
- Ben, you got to...
- I'm on it.

15:59.867 --> 16:02.534
Why is Tom over there
chatting it up with Jaeger?

16:02.535 --> 16:04.369
- I don't know. I'll handle it.
- No, no.

16:04.370 --> 16:07.973
I don't need your subtle charm on this.

16:07.974 --> 16:10.141
Bill, hi.

16:10.142 --> 16:12.977
Just wanted to reconfirm that I
can still count on your vote.

16:12.978 --> 16:16.213
Actually, Madam President, I've been
doing quite a bit of soul searching

16:16.214 --> 16:18.548
and I'm afraid I need to
listen to my conscience.

16:18.549 --> 16:21.251
Conscience? What the fuck
are you talking about?

16:21.252 --> 16:24.087
After much prayerful consideration,
I have decided to abstain

16:24.088 --> 16:26.990
from the upcoming congressional
tie-breaking vote in Congress.

16:26.991 --> 16:29.258
- Abstain?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:29.259 --> 16:31.860
But then no one wins, you dumbass.

16:31.861 --> 16:33.729
I was warned that you would
say some hurtful things.

16:33.730 --> 16:36.831
Okay, hold on. Let me see if I
can just explain this to you

16:36.832 --> 16:39.033
in terms that you might
understand, okay?

16:39.034 --> 16:43.604
Let's say that your chief of staff...
Nadia, is it?

16:43.605 --> 16:45.872
- That's...
- Okay, and she's down on her knees

16:45.873 --> 16:49.443
and she's got your balls in her hand

16:49.444 --> 16:52.579
and she's working your shaft
just the way you like it.

16:52.580 --> 16:56.148
And moments before you're about to come

16:56.149 --> 16:59.552
all over her stupid Slavic face,

16:59.553 --> 17:03.989
she says, "Nyet, after much
prayerful consideration,

17:03.990 --> 17:08.425
I have to abstain from
the upcoming blowjob."

17:08.426 --> 17:10.829
Are you Nadia in this situation?

17:10.829 --> 17:14.164
Just get out of my sight. Oh, God, fuck.

17:14.165 --> 17:17.734
- Okay.
- Let me guess, Jaeger's abstaining.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.303
- Yeah.
- Nickerson, too.

17:19.304 --> 17:21.503
Tom's not lobbying votes for O'Brien.

17:21.505 --> 17:23.339
He's asking people to abstain.

17:23.339 --> 17:24.607
What the fuck is happening?

17:24.608 --> 17:26.541
If no one gets a majority in the House,

17:26.542 --> 17:28.878
the vote goes to the Senate. I
explained this on election night.

17:28.879 --> 17:31.046
- I wasn't listening.
- Yeah, but obviously Tom was.

17:31.047 --> 17:34.282
Tom James is an acknowledged master
of the Senate's rules and procedures.

17:34.283 --> 17:37.519
So if it's up to the Senate,
Tom is our next president.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.621
Well, he must be stopped.

17:40.622 --> 17:42.390
Is it too late to get Doyle back?

17:42.391 --> 17:44.492
- We forgot to invite him tonight.
- Okay.

17:44.493 --> 17:46.460
- That's great.
- Tom!

17:46.461 --> 17:47.118
Ma'am.

17:47.119 --> 17:49.095
Congressman Griffin. Mrs.
Griffin. How are you?

17:49.096 --> 17:50.997
- I'm very well, thank you, ma'am.
- Good.

17:50.998 --> 17:54.901
I've been watching you all night
and I know what you're up to.

17:54.902 --> 17:55.726
Oh?

17:55.727 --> 17:58.203
You're trying to get up the
courage to ask me to dance.

17:58.204 --> 18:00.439
(LAUGHS) Guilty.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.741
Ma'am, I would be honored.

18:02.742 --> 18:04.710
Oh, thank you.

18:04.711 --> 18:06.744
- (APPLAUSE)
- Oh.

18:06.745 --> 18:09.047
- Thank you. Hey.
- Hey.

18:09.048 --> 18:10.581
- How are you?
- He asked.

18:10.582 --> 18:14.218
- Thank you. Thank you.
- He asked me.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.754
I think all this meeting and greeting
has really made me work up an appetite.

18:17.755 --> 18:18.321
I'm starving.

18:18.322 --> 18:20.023
Yeah, you never get the
chance to eat at these things.

18:20.024 --> 18:22.626
Never. You know what I
really have a hankering for?

18:22.627 --> 18:25.094
- What's that?
- Korean barbecue.

18:25.095 --> 18:27.696
- Do you like Korean barbecue?
- It's okay.

18:27.697 --> 18:30.066
There's this great place
that I heard about.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.501
It's in Annandale. What is the name
of it? I'm trying to remember.

18:33.502 --> 18:36.538
Oh, right, right. Um...

18:36.539 --> 18:39.473
(WHISPERS) the Cocksucking Backstabber.

18:40.943 --> 18:43.911
Oh, keep dancing, Tom.
Don't stop dancing.

18:43.912 --> 18:46.580
Don't look around.
Nobody's gonna help you.

18:46.581 --> 18:49.283
No, no. Right. Ma'am, let me explain.

18:49.284 --> 18:51.617
What... what... what that...
I think you're referring...

18:51.618 --> 18:55.288
You know what? I think maybe we
should go and talk in private.

18:55.289 --> 18:57.290
That's perfect timing, isn't it? Yeah?

18:57.291 --> 18:58.658
- Yes.
- (APPLAUSE)

18:58.659 --> 19:00.158
- Thank you for your support.
- Thank you.

19:00.159 --> 19:01.860
- Thank you all.
- Thank you so much.

19:01.861 --> 19:03.929
- So nice to see you all.
- Come. You can't get away.

19:03.930 --> 19:06.198
- Let's go. Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

19:06.199 --> 19:07.799
- Right, we're gonna do it.
- Thank you.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.468
How stupid are you, you
motherfucking snake?

19:10.469 --> 19:13.037
I know all about your meeting
with Marwood and Purcell.

19:13.038 --> 19:15.506
I know all about how
you're trying to fuck me

19:15.507 --> 19:18.508
with that abstinence program of yours.

19:18.509 --> 19:20.910
Underneath this whole honorable,

19:20.911 --> 19:23.713
decent, wholesome Boy
Scout crap of yours,

19:23.714 --> 19:26.116
I know exactly who you are.

19:26.117 --> 19:27.483
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, I do.

19:27.484 --> 19:29.485
Right, so I don't have to explain

19:29.486 --> 19:32.788
that I am not someone who
would piss away my presidency

19:32.789 --> 19:34.790
- on a bunch of half-ass decisions.
- What?

19:34.791 --> 19:38.025
And, by the way, by messing
around with that pretty boy

19:38.026 --> 19:39.961
Charlie Baird, for God's sake.

19:39.962 --> 19:43.464
What? Charlie Baird? What does Charlie
Baird have to do with any of this?

19:43.465 --> 19:45.765
I don't know. He's got
nothing to do with it.

19:45.766 --> 19:48.168
- Oh, my God, you're such a liar!
- The point is he...

19:48.169 --> 19:52.205
You're such a liar! Why did you even
join my ticket in the first place?

19:52.206 --> 19:55.941
Because I happen to believe in
something called public service.

19:55.942 --> 19:58.644
- Oh, bullshit!
- Okay, well, then I got no fucking idea.

19:58.645 --> 20:00.446
- I'll tell you why.
- Go ahead.

20:00.447 --> 20:03.181
Because you wanted to be a
step closer to the presidency

20:03.182 --> 20:05.116
and to me.

20:05.117 --> 20:05.883
Oh, my God.

20:05.884 --> 20:08.186
You wanted it so bad,
you could taste it.

20:08.187 --> 20:10.188
<i>This is unbelievable. Please.</i>

20:10.189 --> 20:13.924
You are lying now just
like you lied back then

20:13.925 --> 20:18.162
just like you lied about that night
in the cab with the green shoes.

20:18.163 --> 20:20.796
Oh, well, now I got no idea
what you're talking about.

20:20.797 --> 20:22.122
Yeah, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

20:22.123 --> 20:22.632
No.

20:22.633 --> 20:24.233
You remembered the green
shoes that night,

20:24.234 --> 20:26.636
but not the fact that
you wanted to fuck me?

20:26.637 --> 20:28.404
Come on. Come on.

20:28.405 --> 20:30.972
No straight man remembers
a woman's shoes.

20:30.973 --> 20:33.141
Well, you got me. I'm gay, so...

20:33.142 --> 20:37.379
Just admit it. Just say the
truth for once in your life.

20:37.380 --> 20:40.281
Come on, Tom. You wanted
to fuck me that night.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.949
- Just say it.
- Will you stop it?!

20:41.950 --> 20:44.451
Just say it. You wanted
to fuck my brains out.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.353
All right, I wanted to
fuck your brains out!

20:46.354 --> 20:48.955
There you go. And now you're
trying to fuck me tonight.

20:48.956 --> 20:52.691
- No, I am fucking you tonight.
- I'm gonna fuck you.

20:59.599 --> 21:03.068
I mean, if I never see the White
House again, it'll be too soon.

21:03.069 --> 21:05.003
It's funny, you know. I love my job.

21:05.004 --> 21:07.171
I've been working for Congressman
Furlong since I was 15.

21:07.172 --> 21:09.473
- Oh.
- Mike, where's the president?

21:09.474 --> 21:11.275
- And where's Tom?
- I don't know.

21:11.276 --> 21:15.111
- What, are you drunk?
- Maybe, Mr. Hipflask.

21:15.112 --> 21:17.247
Listen, I'm a high functioning alcoholic

21:17.248 --> 21:20.382
and you're a sloppy weekend drunk.
Now get with it.

21:21.986 --> 21:24.752
- Ma'am?
- (MOANING)

21:33.529 --> 21:36.063
(SHAKY BREATHING)

21:37.266 --> 21:39.466
(WHIMPERS)

21:43.471 --> 21:45.072
(WHIMPERS)

21:45.073 --> 21:47.174
JONAH: <i>Hi. Jonah Ryan. Thanks
for coming out tonight.</i>

21:47.175 --> 21:49.643
Let me know if you have any questions.
Hi. Jonah Ryan.

21:49.644 --> 21:51.711
Running for Congress and I hope
I can count on your support.

21:51.712 --> 21:54.680
This is my boss Polly. She's gonna
be showing me the ropes today.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.482
Oh, Polly, look at this.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.117
Big shoes. You know
what that means, right?

21:58.118 --> 21:59.851
Uh, big feet?

21:59.852 --> 22:01.753
Can't argue with that. Maybe
you should run for Congress.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.755
- Your name is Jonah, right?
- Yeah.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.423
So why does your shirt say Jon H Ryan?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.059
Fuck.

22:09.060 --> 22:11.462
This is good. This is working.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.397
Oh, bowling alley's
always a good choice.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.733
I mean, skating rink's
good for a male candidate,

22:15.734 --> 22:18.401
but it's cold and gals tend to nip out.

22:18.402 --> 22:21.004
- Hi, I'm Jo...
- Hey, Jonah.

22:21.005 --> 22:24.006
Could I get a child size 12, please?

22:25.242 --> 22:27.009
What are you doing here, Teddy?

22:27.010 --> 22:28.777
I'm looking forward to some bowling.

22:28.778 --> 22:31.613
Although pocket pool is more my game.

22:31.614 --> 22:33.415
You listen to me, you fucking weirdo.

22:33.416 --> 22:37.318
I was a victim, but I am not
gonna let you define me.

22:37.319 --> 22:38.986
Nice blog, Mary.

22:38.987 --> 22:40.921
You know what? People like you,

22:40.922 --> 22:44.325
you look like us, but there's
a little piece missing.

22:44.326 --> 22:46.092
You're like a different species

22:46.093 --> 22:48.461
and one that I hope gets
struck from the Earth

22:48.462 --> 22:52.499
because you're a bully and Jonah
Ryan stands up to bullies.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.900
- Yes. Yes, he does.
- (APPLAUSE)

22:54.901 --> 22:58.103
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah,
this is a no haters alley.

22:58.104 --> 23:01.307
Okay, you and Boo-Boo the
ball-fondling bear here

23:01.308 --> 23:02.874
have exactly two seconds
to get the fuck out.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.776
Our work is done here.
Tell Selina hello.

23:04.777 --> 23:06.444
Yeah, great place for an event, Dan.

23:06.445 --> 23:08.946
The teenager selling cocaine in
the bathroom thought so, too.

23:08.947 --> 23:11.647
- Hey.
- Oh, looking good, 26.

23:14.218 --> 23:15.385
Hi, all.

23:15.386 --> 23:16.620
Ma'am, have you seen Tom?

23:16.621 --> 23:17.721
- Couple times.
- Good.

23:17.722 --> 23:19.356
I need Nickerson, I need Jaeger,

23:19.357 --> 23:20.589
'cause we're gonna finish this.

23:20.590 --> 23:22.791
- Okay, walk this way.
- Yeah.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.430
- SELINA: Gotcha!
- (NICKERSON GASPS)

23:27.431 --> 23:28.931
- (LAUGHS) Hi.
- Hi.

23:28.932 --> 23:31.232
Can I have a few minutes of
your time in the Green Room?

23:31.233 --> 23:33.268
The Green Room? That sounds historic.

23:33.269 --> 23:35.437
Oh, it is. It's where Woodrow Wilson

23:35.438 --> 23:37.405
had some of his most
significant strokes.

23:37.406 --> 23:39.106
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:39.107 --> 23:41.675
- Hey, buddy. Hey. Been a while.
- Mike.

23:41.676 --> 23:44.211
Look, about how things went
down at the end, I am so sorry.

23:44.212 --> 23:46.714
I should thank you 'cause
it was a wake-up call

23:46.715 --> 23:49.349
for me to get out of the
insanity of DC politics.

23:49.350 --> 23:52.585
Amen to that, brother. This place sucks.

23:52.586 --> 23:55.788
Listen, I have lined up a
sweet private sector gig.

23:55.789 --> 23:58.790
Oh? On the QT, I got
something in the works, too.

23:58.791 --> 24:02.394
I am the new director of
communications for the NHL.

24:02.395 --> 24:05.963
- You got the hockey job. Perfect.
- Where are you headed?

24:05.964 --> 24:10.368
I'm going to CL International Time.

24:10.369 --> 24:12.103
- That sounds great.
- Mmm, big.

24:12.104 --> 24:13.771
Listen, any time you want Caps tickets,

24:13.772 --> 24:15.605
you hit me up, buddy, all right?

24:15.606 --> 24:17.273
And if you ever need
anything international.

24:17.274 --> 24:18.775
- And congratulations.
- You, too.

24:18.776 --> 24:21.277
- Mazel. Yeah.
- Good luck.

24:21.278 --> 24:22.979
Fuck.

24:22.980 --> 24:24.380
If you think that you are getting

24:24.381 --> 24:27.082
those worthless toy boats now,

24:27.083 --> 24:28.984
I'm gonna shut down those factories

24:28.985 --> 24:31.487
faster than you can bedazzle
a fucking sweatshirt.

24:31.488 --> 24:34.789
- Let's cut the shit, Selina.
- Oh, here it is.

24:34.790 --> 24:37.058
All roads through Colorado go through me

24:37.059 --> 24:39.026
and the toll just went up.

24:39.027 --> 24:41.194
You're playing a very
dangerous game of chicken

24:41.195 --> 24:42.729
with the head fucking hen.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.731
'Cause if I don't win the White House,

24:44.732 --> 24:47.701
O'Brien is gonna sink your stupid boats

24:47.702 --> 24:50.003
and you're gonna look like
a hair-sprayed asshole

24:50.004 --> 24:52.138
in your 1980s mother-of-the-bride dress.

24:52.139 --> 24:55.408
And if I do win, I will
have my administration

24:55.409 --> 24:57.276
come to your shitty little district

24:57.277 --> 25:00.245
and shake it to death
like a Guatemalan nanny.

25:00.246 --> 25:04.282
And then I'm gonna have
the IRS crawl so far up

25:04.283 --> 25:07.385
your husband's colon, he's gonna wish

25:07.386 --> 25:10.554
the only thing they find is more cancer.

25:10.555 --> 25:11.755
Good God.

25:11.756 --> 25:14.792
So can I count on your vote?

25:14.793 --> 25:17.260
Or do I need to shove a
box of White House M&Ms

25:17.261 --> 25:19.896
up your stretched-out, six-baby vag?

25:19.897 --> 25:21.798
- (GARY GROANS)
- (GULPS)

25:21.799 --> 25:23.599
Yes, you can count on my vote.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.735
I think I want to hear

25:25.736 --> 25:28.804
an okey-dokey, Annie Oakley.

25:28.805 --> 25:31.239
Okey-dokey, Annie Oakley.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.874
Oh, super-duper, trooper.

25:32.875 --> 25:35.376
Now get the fuck out of
here, Congresswoman.

25:35.377 --> 25:37.511
Merry Christmas, Amy.

25:37.512 --> 25:41.315
Oh, Candi Caruso is who you are.

25:41.316 --> 25:45.084
I'm surprised to see you here
after what happened in Nevada.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.688
"Nev-add-a." I told POTUS that
there are other qualified people

25:48.689 --> 25:52.425
out there for special advisor, but she
insisted she couldn't think of any, so...

25:52.426 --> 25:54.860
- Oh. Guess what.
- Hmm?

25:54.861 --> 25:57.830
- I am engaged. Mm-hmm.
- (GASPS) Wow!

25:57.831 --> 25:59.731
Who's... who... to whom?

25:59.732 --> 26:02.533
Gary Welsh. You know, Gary Welsh.

26:02.534 --> 26:04.469
- Gary Welsh? Oh!
- Gary Welsh at State.

26:04.470 --> 26:07.371
He was supposed to be on this
50 Hottest thing that I'm in,

26:07.372 --> 26:09.907
but they got his name wrong.
They spelled it incorrectly.

26:09.908 --> 26:14.010
Turns out there's an actual guy by
that name. They put him in instead.

26:14.011 --> 26:16.213
- That's just a bad thing.
- Terrible. Terrible.

26:16.214 --> 26:18.648
I'm sorry to hear that,
but happy for you.

26:18.649 --> 26:21.083
- Oh! Thank you.
- All that.

26:21.084 --> 26:24.620
Yeah, okay. Uh-oh, President
of the United States needs me.

26:24.621 --> 26:27.122
- So...
- Mmm, yeah.

26:27.123 --> 26:29.824
Take care. (CLEARS THROAT)

26:29.825 --> 26:32.794
Hey, Opie, grab your coonskin
cap and let's get out of here.

26:32.795 --> 26:35.330
Oh, okay.

26:35.331 --> 26:37.432
- It wasn't you.
- What?

26:37.433 --> 26:41.401
You're not hot. Gary Welsh at State is.
You're a typo.

26:41.402 --> 26:44.337
But like you said, it's not
up here, it's what's in here.

26:46.574 --> 26:49.140
And won't you give my
regards to your wife?

26:49.141 --> 26:50.142
Yes, ma'am.

26:50.143 --> 26:52.745
She's the head of the Red Cross
in Racine, did you know that?

26:52.746 --> 26:53.245
She's a saint.

26:53.246 --> 26:54.747
You can count on my
vote, Madam President.

26:54.748 --> 26:56.615
- That is a promise.
- Oh, yes, it is a promise.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.583
- Yes. Go. Turn, go.
- Mm-hmm.

26:58.584 --> 27:01.086
Well, ah, I guess this party

27:01.087 --> 27:04.089
is officially now over.
So how did we do?

27:04.090 --> 27:07.725
We're about the same place we were at
the beginning of the ball plus Graves.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.694
We could have secured Platt, but he never
got the picture with his wife's purse.

27:10.695 --> 27:12.796
I just hope things are going
good in New Hampshire.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.198
REPORTER: <i>Good evening. We begin
with some shocking footage</i>

27:15.199 --> 27:17.400
of congressional candidate Jonah Ryan

27:17.401 --> 27:19.569
all captured on amateur video.

27:19.570 --> 27:21.004
We do have to warn you, though,

27:21.005 --> 27:23.872
<i>Ryan's language is extremely graphic.</i>

27:23.873 --> 27:26.041
People like you, you look like us,

27:26.042 --> 27:28.410
but there's a little piece missing.

27:28.411 --> 27:30.245
You're a different species,

27:30.246 --> 27:32.713
one that I hope gets
struck from the Earth.

27:32.714 --> 27:34.815
Fuck me, Amadeus.

27:34.816 --> 27:36.717
Can't even see the guy
that Jonah's yelling at.

27:36.718 --> 27:40.021
God, Polly's not gonna think that
I was yelling at her, will she?

27:40.022 --> 27:42.222
Why don't we call her
publicist and find out?

27:42.223 --> 27:44.624
Wait a second. Richard, tell me you
have that from the other angle.

27:44.625 --> 27:46.626
Oh, definitely.

27:46.627 --> 27:50.362
TEDDY: <i>Hey, Jonah. I'll get
a child size 12, please.</i>

27:50.363 --> 27:52.298
What are you doing here?

27:52.299 --> 27:54.133
- <i> (APPLAUSE)</i>
- Thank you. Thank you.

27:54.134 --> 27:55.901
I don't know what happened there.

27:55.902 --> 27:57.903
- You did the same fucking thing!
- Literally.

27:57.904 --> 28:00.672
Oh, yeah, you know what? You're
right, I did the exact same thing.

28:00.673 --> 28:02.740
After the national elections,

28:02.741 --> 28:05.577
the president may have found herself
with a bad lie in the rough,

28:05.578 --> 28:07.512
but after stabilizing the economy,

28:07.513 --> 28:10.781
the House vote is starting
to look like a gimme putt.

28:10.782 --> 28:15.252
And mark my words, the president
will end up atop the leaderboard

28:15.253 --> 28:18.387
just like Inbee Park or Lydia Ko

28:18.388 --> 28:20.656
or any of the other great female golfers

28:20.657 --> 28:23.391
- in the LPGA Tour.

28:23.392 --> 28:25.760
I would like to get back to questions

28:25.761 --> 28:28.263
about the first daughter's lesbianism.

28:28.264 --> 28:29.663
(CLAMORING)

28:30.305 --> 28:36.916
