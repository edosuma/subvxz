WEBVTT

00:02.101 --> 00:03.901
Previously on "Queen of Jordan".

00:03.956 --> 00:06.056
Randy's another harvest dad,
I need a nanny.

00:06.442 --> 00:08.177
That's perfect!

00:08.193 --> 00:10.961
All my children
were taken away.

00:10.996 --> 00:12.163
Can you believe that
D'Fwan is telling you

00:12.197 --> 00:14.582
that Angie is starting
her own clothing line?

00:14.633 --> 00:15.883
Why don't you
control your dog?

00:15.917 --> 00:19.336
He controls me!

00:21.389 --> 00:22.490
Hello, Angie...

00:22.524 --> 00:25.559
I mean, hello, whoever it is
going to be.

00:25.594 --> 00:27.061
Hi, Jack, it's Angie.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.262
I wanted to remind you we
have a meeting

00:28.313 --> 00:29.680
today about my fashion line.

00:29.714 --> 00:30.681
<i>Looking forward to it.</i>

00:30.715 --> 00:32.266
We can do a lot of
cross-promotion

00:32.317 --> 00:34.568
between our shows
and your clothing Brand,

00:34.603 --> 00:35.853
uh, cheek.

00:35.887 --> 00:37.271
It's pronounced "chic".

00:37.322 --> 00:38.322
It's French.

00:38.356 --> 00:40.024
Now that I'm a fashion designer,

00:40.058 --> 00:41.325
I'm an octuple threat...

00:41.359 --> 00:44.612
Reality star, actress,
singer/song-reader,

00:44.663 --> 00:47.865
perfumist, IBS survivor,
best-selling author

00:47.899 --> 00:50.501
of a book I didn't write,
catchphrase coiner.

00:50.535 --> 00:53.287
"I'll take that with cheese."

00:53.338 --> 00:54.839
Well they don't all work.

00:54.873 --> 00:57.258
Cheek is stretchable
formal wear

00:57.292 --> 01:00.377
for elegant plus-sized
women and huskier gays.

01:00.411 --> 01:02.863
Tonight is the big fashion show
for cheek's summer line.

01:02.898 --> 01:05.465
I find that my target customer
sweats a lot

01:05.516 --> 01:07.351
and often gets thrown
into a public pool.

01:07.385 --> 01:08.886
Now this show is the...

01:08.920 --> 01:11.355
Angie, I'm sorry, but I
have to take this other call.

01:11.389 --> 01:13.557
What?
No, you don't...

01:13.591 --> 01:14.892
Rude!

01:14.926 --> 01:16.193
This is Jack Donaghy.

01:16.228 --> 01:17.778
This is Sam Lockwood
with the State Department.

01:20.765 --> 01:22.900
I'm stunned.

01:22.934 --> 01:25.369
The CIA captured
a North Korean spy.

01:25.403 --> 01:28.072
So we were able to arrange
a prisoner swap next week.

01:28.106 --> 01:31.392
In exchange for my wife,
they get their spy back,

01:31.426 --> 01:33.110
a crate
of Hollister sweatshirts

01:33.144 --> 01:37.481
and a signed headshot
of Don Johnson.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.816
They just got Nash Bridges.

01:38.850 --> 01:41.552
Obviously, this is
a very personal matter,

01:41.586 --> 01:43.971
so I would appreciate it
if your guys at Bravo...

01:44.005 --> 01:46.740
Excuse me, "gays" at Bravo...

01:46.775 --> 01:48.342
Handle this
with the same delicacy

01:48.376 --> 01:49.626
with which you handled

01:49.644 --> 01:52.997
D'Fwan's boyfriend's
pregnancy scare.

01:53.031 --> 01:56.016
It's my way till pay day.

02:00.405 --> 02:01.572
Where is he?

02:01.606 --> 02:03.857
Jack Donaghy is late
for our meeting.

02:03.909 --> 02:06.994
Not to be racist, but white
guys are typically punctual.

02:07.028 --> 02:08.946
I'm sorry I got so real,

02:08.979 --> 02:11.532
but nothing's gonna change
unless there's a dialogue.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.335
I've never been so
disrespected in my life.

02:14.369 --> 02:18.038
And I've gone to
and worked at the post office.

02:19.541 --> 02:22.593
Mrs. Jordan, Mr. Donaghy
sends his apologies,

02:22.627 --> 02:24.962
but he is unable to
attend your meeting.

02:24.996 --> 02:26.380
I'm here as his representative.

02:26.431 --> 02:27.664
No.

02:27.682 --> 02:29.967
That man is about to get some
cheese with that.

02:30.001 --> 02:31.885
That catchphrase
is improving, baby!

02:31.937 --> 02:34.688
You don't give me notes!

02:34.723 --> 02:36.840
Girlfriend.

02:36.858 --> 02:38.275
Looks like you need
a girlfriend.

02:38.310 --> 02:39.727
I have a girlfriend.

02:39.778 --> 02:43.347
Her name is
Raven-Symone Senior.

02:43.365 --> 02:46.533
I'm really close
to the whole <i>Q of</i> cast.

02:46.568 --> 02:49.853
So I know they're gonna pull me
into all of their drama

02:49.871 --> 02:51.855
and I'm gonna be
on the show a lot.

02:51.873 --> 02:53.991
I will be on the show a lot.

02:54.025 --> 02:57.161
- Where's Jack?
- Boob monster!

02:57.195 --> 02:58.162
I'm supposed to
have a meeting

02:58.196 --> 02:59.747
with Jack Donaghy.

02:59.798 --> 03:02.049
Do you not know where
your own husband is?

03:02.083 --> 03:03.217
I know they're not married.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.668
I just like them to know

03:04.702 --> 03:06.303
I don't give a
about their lives.

03:06.338 --> 03:08.005
Jack's probably busy, Angie.

03:08.039 --> 03:10.140
His wife was kidnapped,
but now she's coming back,

03:10.175 --> 03:11.708
and all these cameras
are around,

03:11.726 --> 03:12.843
so they've been following
him everywhere.

03:12.877 --> 03:13.877
Uhhuh.

03:13.895 --> 03:15.646
I see what's happening.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.314
Jacks' not just
blowing me off.

03:17.349 --> 03:19.433
He's trying to ruin
my big night.

03:19.484 --> 03:21.185
No, Angie, what's happening
with him is cra...

03:21.219 --> 03:22.987
No, what's happening
is the cheek fashion show.

03:23.021 --> 03:25.272
That's what people
wanna know about.

03:25.323 --> 03:28.659
And Tracy's planning a huge
surprise for me at the end.

03:28.693 --> 03:29.893
Really? What is it?

03:29.911 --> 03:32.446
I don't know, Liz.
It's a surprise.

03:32.497 --> 03:35.282
Do you know
what a surprise is?

03:35.333 --> 03:37.501
Now you do.

03:37.535 --> 03:40.788
You didn't have a drink.
Wha?

03:40.839 --> 03:43.073
Shh!

03:43.091 --> 03:44.675
Don't learn to talk.

03:44.709 --> 03:47.711
A woman's power comes
from her silence.

03:50.015 --> 03:52.132
- You're Liz, right?
- Randi.

03:52.183 --> 03:53.417
Great episode last week.

03:53.435 --> 03:55.052
I thought it was very
brave of you to pose

03:55.086 --> 03:57.354
for <i>Playboy</i> against
<i>Playboy's</i> wishes.

03:57.389 --> 04:00.257
I need a date to Angie's
fashion show

04:00.275 --> 04:04.812
and Tracy tells me that you're,
you know, the village bicycle.

04:04.863 --> 04:07.731
What? No.
Why would he say that?

04:07.765 --> 04:09.700
Doctor guy, pilot guy,
Cleveland dude,

04:09.734 --> 04:12.569
British guy, rich dude,
James Franco.

04:12.603 --> 04:15.122
I've been with the same woman
for 22 years.

04:15.156 --> 04:19.243
No judgments, but to me,
Liz Lemon is a sex maniac.

04:19.277 --> 04:23.213
Well, a lady never goes
anywhere without a date.

04:23.248 --> 04:26.333
- Can someone watch Virginia?
- I can't.

04:26.384 --> 04:28.385
Contractually, I can only
hold beautiful black babies

04:28.420 --> 04:29.753
in benetton ads.

04:29.787 --> 04:31.288
And I don't know if I should.

04:31.306 --> 04:34.124
'Cause I'm might bite
these fat little legs.

04:34.142 --> 04:36.593
I might eat them up,
they're so fat and juicy.

04:41.132 --> 04:43.901
No, Sam, the military
brings her back.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.103
Don't even let Clinton
know about this.

04:46.137 --> 04:48.572
He and Steve Bing will break out
their sex plane.

04:48.606 --> 04:50.441
It is a sex plane.

04:50.475 --> 04:51.942
There aren't even any seats.

04:51.976 --> 04:54.644
It's just futons and jacuzzis.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.645
I've gotta run, Sam.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.999
Jack I...
God, what is this?

04:59.033 --> 05:01.251
It's just
one of our shows.

05:01.286 --> 05:03.120
They're following me today.

05:03.154 --> 05:06.323
Is this one of those
ridiculous reality shows

05:06.341 --> 05:08.992
like <i>Ken Burns's jazz?</i>
Disgusting.

05:09.010 --> 05:10.794
I'm sorry, Diana.
Ignore them.

05:10.828 --> 05:12.796
Eventually, you won't
even know they're here.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.848
I'm just a little
overwhelmed right now.

05:14.883 --> 05:16.166
I could use a drink.

05:16.184 --> 05:17.801
I'm afraid that while
we're on camera,

05:17.835 --> 05:22.272
I can only offer you D'Fwan's
boutique wine, "d'fwine".

05:22.307 --> 05:24.007
D'fwine.

05:24.025 --> 05:25.675
Please d'fwink responsibly.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.944
To Avery's return.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.613
I'm a part of this as well.

05:29.647 --> 05:32.682
I played Avery in the TV movie,
<i>Kidnapped by danger.</i>

05:32.700 --> 05:33.951
Jenna, this is
for family only.

05:35.487 --> 05:38.188
Now you sound like the cops
outside of Jackie O's funeral.

05:38.206 --> 05:39.540
But I got in there

05:39.574 --> 05:42.659
and sang almost all
of <i>Big spender.</i>

05:44.829 --> 05:46.380
I suggest you go back to

05:46.414 --> 05:50.534
whatever Florida bathroom
you crawled out of.

05:50.552 --> 05:53.170
I can see
I'm not wanted here.

05:53.204 --> 05:55.372
But thank you for looking up
on Wikipedia

05:55.390 --> 05:59.476
that I was conceived
on a toilet.

05:59.511 --> 06:01.512
No one wants me
in their story.

06:03.714 --> 06:06.934
If a beautiful woman cries
and no one hears it,

06:06.985 --> 06:09.603
did she waste $700
on crying lessons

06:09.654 --> 06:13.190
at Adrian Brody's unaccredited
acting school?

06:13.224 --> 06:15.742
Jack, when Avery
does get back,

06:15.777 --> 06:17.694
I don't think we should
tell her about us.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:31.155 --> 06:33.355
I want to make sure
we all we're very clear

06:33.438 --> 06:35.639
about what my mother in law
said in my office.

06:35.673 --> 06:38.225
She said we shouldn't
tell Avery about Gus.

06:38.276 --> 06:40.877
Gus is someone I've gone
into business with

06:40.912 --> 06:42.879
and Avery wouldn't
approve of him.

06:42.914 --> 06:45.048
Why would she disapprove?

06:45.083 --> 06:49.453
Well, uh, because
they dated... at Yale.

06:49.487 --> 06:50.988
Gus was a Professor.

06:51.022 --> 06:52.539
Of course you'll meet him.

06:52.573 --> 06:55.826
We do business all the time.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.628
Tracy,
I know you're planning

06:57.662 --> 07:00.030
a big romantic
surprise for me

07:00.048 --> 07:02.299
at the end
of the fashion show.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.052
But Jack Donaghy is messing
with my special day.

07:05.086 --> 07:07.054
So whatever you were thinking
about doing, double it.

07:07.088 --> 07:08.221
Call Mo'nique.

07:08.256 --> 07:09.640
Do a dove release.

07:09.674 --> 07:12.059
Parachute in and propose to me
all over again, you hear?

07:12.093 --> 07:14.311
Angie, I wasn't even gonna
go to your fashion show.

07:14.345 --> 07:15.595
It's at 8:00,

07:15.647 --> 07:17.431
which is 9:00 am Tokyo time.

07:17.482 --> 07:19.766
That's when Takashi's parents
leave for work

07:19.817 --> 07:21.985
and we play
<i>mass effect 3</i> online.

07:23.655 --> 07:26.356
Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka
think he's at school,

07:26.390 --> 07:29.660
but he's playing video games
with a drunk adult.

07:29.694 --> 07:32.195
Now I know
you're just saying that

07:32.229 --> 07:35.582
because you don't want to
ruin the surprise

07:35.616 --> 07:37.901
'cause you're a good husband.

07:40.204 --> 07:41.872
My God.

07:41.906 --> 07:44.875
Ned Stark is dead?

07:44.909 --> 07:46.960
I love my wife.

07:47.011 --> 07:48.795
I want her to be happy.

07:48.846 --> 07:51.598
But more than that,
I'm gonna do nothing.

07:51.632 --> 07:53.967
It's hard trying
to have it all.

07:55.970 --> 07:58.388
You wait here, Bernardo.

08:03.594 --> 08:05.612
She bit my.

08:05.646 --> 08:06.980
Eew.

08:07.031 --> 08:08.765
My glasses.

08:08.783 --> 08:10.901
It's work. It's work.

08:10.935 --> 08:13.436
But she is at such a fun age.

08:13.454 --> 08:14.905
You get so much out of it.

08:14.939 --> 08:17.908
It's fine, I'm fine.

08:17.942 --> 08:20.293
If everything goes
according to plan,

08:20.328 --> 08:22.662
Avery will be back
in a few days.

08:22.714 --> 08:24.664
In the meantime I have
a lot of work to do...

08:24.716 --> 08:27.167
With Gus, my business partner,

08:27.218 --> 08:29.803
whom Diana mentioned earlier.

08:29.837 --> 08:32.672
Gus, there's Gus.

08:32.724 --> 08:34.091
Why are you wearing the hat

08:34.125 --> 08:35.926
I asked you not to wear
any more to our meetings?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.309
We're higher up here,

08:37.345 --> 08:40.097
so the sun's electricity
is stronger.

08:40.131 --> 08:42.816
Well, uh, let's go over
the numbers, Gus.

08:42.850 --> 08:45.635
As you can see,
the numbers look pretty good.

08:45.653 --> 08:49.406
We're under budget and
in line with projections.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.241
Great, well, uh, meeting over.

08:51.275 --> 08:56.246
You probably shouldn't have even
filmed that, it was so boring.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.782
Diana, you remember Gus,
whom you said we shouldn't tell

08:58.816 --> 09:01.368
Avery about because
she used to date him.

09:01.419 --> 09:03.319
She was nasty.

09:03.337 --> 09:05.338
She loved pee.

09:05.373 --> 09:07.424
- Thank you, Gus.
- No, Jack.

09:07.458 --> 09:09.159
I didn't say Gus.

09:09.177 --> 09:11.428
I already explained
to them what I said.

09:11.462 --> 09:16.833
I said I did not want Avery
to know about Rus.

09:16.851 --> 09:20.971
In slavic myth, Rus is
the founder of Russia.

09:21.005 --> 09:22.639
Why can't Avery know about

09:22.673 --> 09:24.808
the mythological founder
of Russia?

09:24.842 --> 09:29.863
Because Jack has invested a lot
of money in a restaurant

09:29.897 --> 09:32.282
I'm opening called "Rus".

09:32.316 --> 09:34.568
It is Russian cuisine.

09:34.619 --> 09:36.987
Who doesn't love
cold, purple soup?

09:37.021 --> 09:38.905
Diana, we're talking
about the same thing,

09:38.956 --> 09:40.207
because, as you know,

09:40.241 --> 09:43.660
the restaurant Rus
is the business venture

09:43.694 --> 09:45.879
I'm engaged in with Gus.

09:45.913 --> 09:48.298
Right, he is the chef.

09:48.332 --> 09:51.051
As I mentioned earlier,
he's a Professor at Yale.

09:51.085 --> 09:52.252
Which is funny,

09:52.303 --> 09:55.055
because he looks so much
more like a chef.

09:55.089 --> 09:57.757
What's funniest...
Is that's he's both.

09:57.809 --> 09:59.843
And now he works
at the restaurant

09:59.877 --> 10:03.647
we can't tell Avery about.

10:03.681 --> 10:06.683
And the grand opening
is tonight.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.822
Now he's opening up
a restaurant

10:11.856 --> 10:13.990
the same night
my line launches?

10:14.025 --> 10:16.693
That is a bridge too far.

10:16.727 --> 10:18.078
That's right.

10:18.112 --> 10:20.614
I read World War II history,
mother-.

10:20.665 --> 10:23.399
Well, nobody's going to care
about his restaurant

10:23.417 --> 10:26.786
when there's a fashion show
going on in the middle of it.

10:26.838 --> 10:29.206
And a big surprise
from my husband.

10:32.009 --> 10:33.009
Eliza Beth.

10:33.044 --> 10:35.262
This is very, very easy for me

10:35.296 --> 10:37.297
to say to you, but you can't
come in here right now.

10:37.348 --> 10:39.015
Wha... l just wanna
drop off this

10:39.050 --> 10:41.935
little crinkly book
that I got for Virginia.

10:41.969 --> 10:43.386
I can't let you in.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.805
After what happened
betwixt you this morning?

10:45.857 --> 10:48.108
No, Virginia is not
having you.

10:48.142 --> 10:50.093
What are you talking about?

10:50.111 --> 10:52.395
I might bite these
fat little legs.

10:52.429 --> 10:54.114
They're so fat and juicy.

10:54.148 --> 10:55.198
Rude.

10:55.233 --> 10:56.867
Whit was a compliment.

10:56.901 --> 10:58.902
That's a thing people
say to babies.

10:58.936 --> 11:00.704
You never talk about
a black woman's leg size.

11:00.738 --> 11:02.706
Not on babies, not on
the Williams sisters,

11:02.740 --> 11:03.740
not on a mannequin at Avenue.

11:03.774 --> 11:04.875
We have come too far.

11:04.909 --> 11:05.876
Now you know me, girl.

11:05.910 --> 11:06.877
I don't, really.

11:06.911 --> 11:08.328
I stay above these feuds.

11:08.379 --> 11:09.880
Did I get involved
when Portia took

11:09.914 --> 11:11.748
the over-the-counter colon
health test in the bathroom

11:11.782 --> 11:13.833
at Randi's domestic violence
costume ball?

11:13.885 --> 11:14.968
I did, but I didn't want to.

11:15.002 --> 11:16.086
Can I be honest?

11:16.120 --> 11:17.888
I think I'm just anxious

11:17.922 --> 11:19.289
for Virginia to love me because
I've been thinking

11:19.307 --> 11:20.390
about motherhood lately.

11:20.424 --> 11:22.259
I have a serious biend
right now and...

11:22.293 --> 11:24.261
Lisa, D'Fwan doesn't talk
about people behind their backs,

11:24.295 --> 11:25.645
so I'm just gonna tell
you straight to your face

11:25.680 --> 11:28.181
that what you're saying
right now is very boring.

11:28.232 --> 11:29.933
All I know is
I'm gonna stay out

11:29.967 --> 11:31.101
of this fight between
you and Virginia.

11:31.135 --> 11:32.686
That baby is a piece of work.

11:32.737 --> 11:34.137
You know she should be
able to stack blocks

11:34.155 --> 11:35.605
in a tower by now,
but she won't do it.

11:35.639 --> 11:38.641
I thought you didn't talk
about people behind their backs.

11:43.314 --> 11:44.447
Hi.

11:47.151 --> 11:49.152
Go away.

11:50.654 --> 11:52.155
Rude.

11:54.658 --> 11:57.210
Down. Down.

11:57.261 --> 11:59.095
Boom, right there.

11:59.130 --> 12:00.964
God, these flower
arrangements.

12:00.998 --> 12:04.467
You people are savages!

12:04.501 --> 12:05.969
Just excited.

12:06.003 --> 12:08.305
Wait, you're putting
spoons in those.

12:08.339 --> 12:10.173
It's just knives and forks.

12:10.191 --> 12:12.175
Why am I even doing this?

12:12.193 --> 12:13.977
I still have to get the menus
from the printer,

12:14.011 --> 12:15.779
go to the cony island
beet market.

12:15.813 --> 12:18.281
I've gotta pick up
Yakov Smirnov at the airport.

12:18.316 --> 12:20.951
That's enough foil, Gus.

12:20.985 --> 12:22.902
Jack, it's been a year
that we prayed

12:22.954 --> 12:25.038
for this... restaurant opening,

12:25.072 --> 12:28.625
and I should just feel
excited and relieved, but...

12:28.659 --> 12:30.827
It's complicated.

12:30.861 --> 12:33.463
When you open a restaurant
with your mother in law.

12:33.497 --> 12:37.167
Everyone knows you're not
talking about the restaurant.

12:37.201 --> 12:39.919
You're talking
about electricity.

12:41.005 --> 12:42.172
Thank you, Gus.

12:42.206 --> 12:45.742
There's the gang!

12:45.760 --> 12:48.044
Virginia.

12:48.078 --> 12:50.380
It's aunt Jenna.

12:50.414 --> 12:52.716
Look.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.017
I heard what Liz
said about you,

12:54.051 --> 12:55.802
and I just have to say

12:55.853 --> 12:59.255
that I have known Liz
a long, long, long time

12:59.273 --> 13:01.090
and she's totally shady.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.095
My God!
You are hilarious.

13:06.113 --> 13:07.230
Do you act?

13:07.264 --> 13:09.265
Because we should
do a movie together

13:09.283 --> 13:12.769
where we're on a road trip
just being sluts.

13:12.787 --> 13:15.121
High five.

13:15.156 --> 13:17.407
No, I don't care
that the others went to

13:17.441 --> 13:20.109
Pierre Batalini salon
without me.

13:20.127 --> 13:22.779
It's not a feud, I just...

13:22.797 --> 13:24.831
I've never spent much time
with babies, okay?

13:24.882 --> 13:28.551
And... what if I'm bad at it?

13:30.888 --> 13:32.472
This is good TV.

13:32.506 --> 13:33.623
I would watch this.

13:33.658 --> 13:35.175
I would feel for Liz.

13:35.209 --> 13:37.227
Isn't this usually a bathroom?

13:37.261 --> 13:40.296
No, Tray, it's usually
Lutz's office.

13:40.314 --> 13:42.032
I see.

13:42.066 --> 13:45.134
I think I just solved the
mystery of the phantom peeper.

13:45.152 --> 13:47.270
What's wrong, L.L.?

13:47.304 --> 13:49.322
You look like Angie when
I tell her I wanna retire

13:49.357 --> 13:51.107
and live in an old lighthouse.

13:51.141 --> 13:52.742
It's just D'Fwan
and everybody

13:52.777 --> 13:54.694
are saying that I'm
in a fight with Virginia,

13:54.745 --> 13:56.696
which is idiotic,
because she's a baby.

13:56.747 --> 13:59.749
Maybe it's just that children
in general don't like you.

13:59.784 --> 14:01.484
Thank you, Tracy.

14:01.502 --> 14:03.837
I am dealing
with something real here,

14:03.871 --> 14:06.673
but all anyone wants to do
on these dumb shows

14:06.707 --> 14:09.125
is fight and scream
and throw things.

14:09.159 --> 14:12.462
I wouldn't know.
I really don't watch TV.

14:12.496 --> 14:14.047
I'm more of a masturbator.

14:14.098 --> 14:16.299
Well I'm about to get
original on you, Tracy.

14:16.333 --> 14:20.336
There is no such thing as
reality on reality television.

14:24.621 --> 14:26.721
You're happy now America?

14:40.482 --> 14:41.667
No.

14:41.718 --> 14:42.919
Yes.

14:52.861 --> 14:54.345
Welcome to Rus.

14:54.363 --> 14:56.480
This evening, we're serving
all the Pierogis Costco had

14:56.514 --> 14:57.848
and then burger king.

14:57.866 --> 15:00.184
That's a sharp look,
Kenneth.

15:00.202 --> 15:03.154
Thank you, sir, but I can't
take all the credit.

15:03.188 --> 15:05.156
Everything I know about
fashion, I learned

15:05.190 --> 15:07.825
from my old college roommate,
John Mark Karr.

15:07.859 --> 15:10.861
Right this way.

15:14.383 --> 15:17.385
For God's sake.

15:21.373 --> 15:22.873
You've got a lot of nerve
coming here.

15:22.891 --> 15:25.343
You know this is
Virginia's night.

15:25.377 --> 15:26.978
You have no class,

15:27.012 --> 15:28.846
you prostitution whore.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.097
What are you talking about?

15:30.148 --> 15:32.350
I'm hitching my wagon
to Virginia's star.

15:32.384 --> 15:34.602
Trying to get
a little camera tiempo.

15:34.653 --> 15:37.488
Jenna, you've had cameras
following you around all day.

15:37.522 --> 15:38.489
You're a star now.

15:38.523 --> 15:41.225
They want you on the show.

15:43.328 --> 15:45.746
They want me.

15:45.781 --> 15:48.732
Which means
I'm too good for this crap.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.786
Like when I sang at that
children's hospital.

15:51.837 --> 15:54.288
Get away from me,
I'm revoking my waiver.

15:54.339 --> 15:55.956
Now blur my face.

15:56.008 --> 15:57.591
Blur it more.

15:57.626 --> 15:58.592
More.

15:58.627 --> 16:00.961
Now disguise my voice.

16:01.013 --> 16:03.580
Thank you, gays.

16:05.417 --> 16:06.684
Yes.

16:06.718 --> 16:08.969
Excuse me, do you know where
the indoor outhouse is?

16:09.021 --> 16:11.188
Is my fashion show ruining
Jack's party?

16:11.223 --> 16:12.306
Don't worry.

16:12.357 --> 16:13.590
Nobody's even noticing it.

16:13.608 --> 16:15.726
There's so much other
stuff going on.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.896
And it's not just Mr. Donaghy
and this oriental matter.

16:18.930 --> 16:21.782
There's the feud between Ms.
Lemon and baby Virginia,

16:21.817 --> 16:26.570
the drama between me and that
cord I tripped on.

16:26.604 --> 16:28.989
Watch it.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.041
I'm sorry, sir.

16:30.075 --> 16:32.293
I shouldn't have
lost my temper.

16:32.327 --> 16:34.378
My damn husband
better show up.

16:34.413 --> 16:35.746
Disaster.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.331
Deandra "I didn't know
I was pregnant"-ed.

16:37.382 --> 16:39.133
Who's gonna wear this now?

16:39.167 --> 16:42.670
Size 12,
that's what I am.

16:42.721 --> 16:44.472
I was
my grandmother's favorite

16:44.506 --> 16:46.006
so I got all her old
hand-me-downs.

17:29.935 --> 17:31.469
What a rush!

17:31.503 --> 17:32.937
You were horrible.

17:32.971 --> 17:34.772
That's the last dress.

17:34.806 --> 17:37.191
Tracy didn't even do anything.

17:37.225 --> 17:39.360
He didn't even show up.

17:39.394 --> 17:42.396
I'm gonna kill that man.

17:47.185 --> 17:49.236
What's cocaine like?

17:51.189 --> 17:53.574
- What was that?
- Damn, you two.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.626
Avery's coming back
from North Korea.

17:55.660 --> 17:57.294
Portia reads the papers.

17:57.329 --> 17:59.463
I hate that
that's my catchphrase.

17:59.498 --> 18:01.165
What was that?

18:01.199 --> 18:02.883
That was nothing.

18:02.918 --> 18:05.553
I mean Jack's like that
with everybody.

18:05.587 --> 18:07.471
He's a kisser.

18:07.506 --> 18:08.639
Right, Jack?

18:08.673 --> 18:10.057
Of course.

18:10.091 --> 18:11.759
It's European.

18:11.810 --> 18:14.812
If you don't kiss someone,
they're offended.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.694
Very good,
nice seeing you, Lemon.

18:30.728 --> 18:33.730
Jack, D'Fwan hasn't
said "hi" yet.

18:40.422 --> 18:43.374
Honey, what was that?

18:43.408 --> 18:47.077
Okay, Liz, I don't know
what she's talking about.

18:47.095 --> 18:51.048
But Virginia said she knows
what you just did for Jack.

18:51.082 --> 18:53.884
She misjudged you,
and she would like a hug.

19:00.725 --> 19:01.925
The feud's over.

19:01.943 --> 19:03.360
It's all good.

19:03.395 --> 19:05.145
Now I'm just looking
forward to this trip.

19:05.197 --> 19:07.731
Because Virginia loves her
little giraffe so much,

19:07.765 --> 19:12.036
the show is sending us on
a girls' getaway to Somalia!

19:15.940 --> 19:18.275
I hope you're at peace
with your God, Tracy Jordan.

19:18.293 --> 19:20.327
Because you are about
to meet your maker.

19:20.378 --> 19:21.912
Honey, you seem upset.

19:21.946 --> 19:23.947
I spent the last 20 years
supporting you.

19:23.965 --> 19:25.916
I had three of your children.

19:25.950 --> 19:29.286
I gave you a kidney,
a kneecap and a bladder.

19:29.304 --> 19:32.556
But I ask you to do one thing
and you can't do it.

19:32.591 --> 19:36.960
All I wanted was a standing
ovation and for people to tweet

19:36.978 --> 19:39.680
that I was the new icon
for black womanhood

19:39.731 --> 19:42.766
and then for me to tweet
"why just black womanhood?"

19:42.800 --> 19:44.518
Instead, I got nothing.

19:44.569 --> 19:46.020
I might as well be Daphne.

19:46.071 --> 19:47.821
Who?

19:47.856 --> 19:49.240
I'm Daphne.

19:49.274 --> 19:50.858
I handle conflict
appropriately,

19:50.909 --> 19:53.244
and I'm up to date on
my mortgage payments.

19:53.278 --> 19:55.279
No, I turned what was
supposed to be

19:55.313 --> 19:58.082
a boring romantic evening
into a gigantic fight

19:58.116 --> 20:00.150
in front of
all these cameras.

20:03.154 --> 20:05.756
Yes.

20:05.790 --> 20:11.045
How inconsiderate of you to
cause all this drama

20:11.096 --> 20:13.797
and start this riveting fight.

20:13.831 --> 20:16.433
Our celebrity marriage
is on a breakup collapse.

20:16.468 --> 20:19.470
We're a train wreck you cannot
look away from!

20:21.856 --> 20:24.892
I can't stand
the sight of you.

20:24.943 --> 20:27.945
My love tank is empty!

20:31.116 --> 20:32.516
Yah!

20:32.534 --> 20:33.517
Lizard egg!

20:36.955 --> 20:39.657
I want a divorce or whatever.

20:39.691 --> 20:41.125
It will be contentious

20:41.159 --> 20:44.662
and last
all through next season.

20:44.696 --> 20:47.698
I'm cheating on you!

20:52.337 --> 20:54.004
Rude!

20:58.652 --> 21:01.102
Next week on <i>Queen of Jordan</i>...

21:02.669 --> 21:03.719
I was in the neighborhood.

21:03.753 --> 21:05.203
I thought I'd pop up
and say hello.

21:05.221 --> 21:08.707
For God sakes, D'Fwan,
I'm working.

21:08.725 --> 21:12.094
Fine. Come here.
