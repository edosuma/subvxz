<i>Do you still get
the same buzz out of it Frank?</i>

00:54.972 --> 00:55.973
<i>Absolutely.</i>

00:56.056 --> 01:00.357
Truth is I love it,
the Formula 1 stuff, the real stuff,

01:00.435 --> 01:02.984
the speed they're going
through the corners,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.567
it's super men so I really believe
these guys meta morph

01:06.650 --> 01:08.493
when they get into the cockpit you know.

01:08.569 --> 01:12.574
They're immensely quick,
and the grip round the corners

01:12.656 --> 01:13.532
is just astonishing.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.327
<i>If you're</i> a <i>pilot flying</i> a <i>jet,</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:56.704
that's wonderful work isn't it? Why?

01:56.742 --> 01:59.416
Because I'm flying supersonic,
twice supersonic.

02:01.788 --> 02:06.089
<i>It blows my mind, the speeds
at which they can control these cars.</i>

02:08.669 --> 02:12.220
<i>What was it, Top Gun,
what did Mav say to Goose?</i>

02:12.299 --> 02:15.849
He said “I feel the need,
the need for speed",

02:15.927 --> 02:17.725
I've never forgotten that.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.490
- And you've always had that?
- Sorry?

02:19.514 --> 02:20.908
You've always had that?

02:20.932 --> 02:22.243
Well I've always been
a little boy for a start,

02:22.267 --> 02:24.440
always enjoyed speed too.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.738
That's why I finished up in a chair,
going too fast.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.795
<i>We didn't sit round
the table as</i> a <i>family</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:35.006
<i>and discuss it and go
this is how we're gonna deal with it</i>

02:35.030 --> 02:36.657
<i>or you know
mum needs some counselling,</i>

02:36.740 --> 02:40.540
<i>the kids need counselling,
dad needs counselling to get through it.</i>

02:40.619 --> 02:44.795
We've never talked about it
<i>as</i> a family, dad's accident, ever.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.782
<i>If it wasn't for Mum
I personally don't think.</i>

03:13.860 --> 03:16.704
<i>Williams would necessarily be around.</i>

03:16.780 --> 03:21.331
I'm a really firm believer in Williams
is not just always about Dad,

03:21.410 --> 03:22.957
it's <i>as</i> much about Mum,

03:23.036 --> 03:28.088
<i>she stood by him through thick and thin,
I mean she saved his life.</i>

04:32.564 --> 04:34.566
<i>Williams is unique now</i>

04:34.649 --> 04:37.823
<i>in that it is
the last of the old style teams</i>

04:37.861 --> 04:41.491
where the team owners
all had their name over the door

04:41.573 --> 04:43.325
and Williams is the only one left.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.054
<i>Frank's very rare
at interviews nowadays</i>

04:47.078 --> 04:49.126
<i>so he doesn't seem as
approachable or accessible</i>

04:49.206 --> 04:50.583
<i>from a, from a fan on the street.</i>

04:50.665 --> 04:52.542
Whether we see enough
of him nowadays

04:52.626 --> 04:54.799
and whether
that's because of his health...

04:54.878 --> 04:55.800
We didn't see him this weekend,

04:55.879 --> 04:57.973
we saw Claire Williams
knocking about on Friday.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.426
<i>She's a great face on the TV as well,</i>

05:00.509 --> 05:02.352
<i>where, you know being interviewed
and the like,</i>

05:02.427 --> 05:05.431
it's interesting to have
a lady <i>as</i> Principal as well.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.151
<i>I think I may have
had like the odd grand dream</i>

05:17.234 --> 05:21.114
but I never thought I would be given
the keys to the shop ever, ever, ever.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.501
I think a bit of it's because
I'm a girl and you know

05:25.575 --> 05:28.044
I can't possibly understand
anything about a car

05:28.119 --> 05:30.542
and you know it's Dad's train set

05:30.580 --> 05:33.049
and he doesn't wanna
hand it over to anybody else.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.764
<i>The Marussia of Will Stevens</i>

05:34.793 --> 05:37.216
<i>gets out the way of Valtteri Bottas
and Max Verstappen</i>

05:37.295 --> 05:39.514
<i>but Verstappen's all over
the back of that Williams.</i>

05:41.174 --> 05:42.485
What about Williams?
Where do you reckon

05:42.509 --> 05:43.761
Williams will place today?

05:43.844 --> 05:49.271
Uh... might get a point.
One of the top ten maybe.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.244
Do you think they're
contenders anymore?

05:51.268 --> 05:54.397
No, no.
Definitely not this year. No chance.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.823
But Jacques,
you were the last driver

06:00.861 --> 06:03.614
to win a World Championship
for Williams.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.897
Yeah that's true, that's true.

06:04.948 --> 06:10.500
- How long ago was that?
- Uh... '97 so 20 years ago.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.172
- Yes.
- Long time.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.045
Too long really, yeah.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.719
<i>In comes Bottas,
goes for another set,</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:19.730
<i>he's just given up,
there's nothing they can do really</i>

06:19.754 --> 06:21.973
<i>and I'm afraid that Williams
are gonna come away</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:24.642
<i>from Monaco with nothing.</i>

06:27.512 --> 06:28.934
<i>It's really frustrating,</i>

06:29.014 --> 06:33.064
<i>it literally is banging your head against
a brick wall, what do we have to do?</i>

06:33.101 --> 06:35.399
You know I have to walk around
with my head held high

06:35.478 --> 06:39.733
and I want to be able to do that um
and I don't feel that I can at the moment.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.990
Do you think Frank feels it
as acutely as you do now?

06:43.069 --> 06:45.322
I'm sure he does,
he's trusted in me

06:45.405 --> 06:48.659
and I don't want him to ever doubt
that trust that he's put in me.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.170
Do you ever doubt it
yourself or...

06:52.245 --> 06:58.002
Um not right now no,
I've got a lot of fight in me left.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.260
<i>Claire is</i> a <i>tough piece of work,</i>

07:02.339 --> 07:05.388
<i>whatever she sets out to do
she always achieves it,</i>

07:05.467 --> 07:07.720
she's a bit like her mother,
her mother was like that,

07:07.802 --> 07:10.225
didn't make a lot of fuss,
just did things.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.187
<i>I love this time of the year
with the Autumn coming.</i>

07:17.270 --> 07:19.443
These are my mum's blossom trees
that we planted.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.524
They look a bit dead now.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.986
These were the ones that we
planted on her,

07:24.069 --> 07:27.118
the anniversary, two year anniversary
of her passing.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.997
I wanted something here
that I could come to and chat to.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.625
- And do you do that?
- Yeah I do, a lot.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.340
I come and ask her why
we can't fix our um,

07:40.418 --> 07:44.423
the wheel nuts on our pit stops
and pray to her that

07:44.506 --> 07:46.304
she might help the guys in R&D

07:46.341 --> 07:48.469
that have been working
so hard on them.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.554
Right.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.977
I've got a whole box of
press clippings in there

07:57.060 --> 07:59.563
from when I was made
Deputy Team Principal.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.865
I thought I would frame them
and put them up

08:01.940 --> 08:05.820
and be all proud of myself, but now
they've just ended up in the shed.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.664
This is a lovely picture
from when we won

08:17.747 --> 08:19.499
the race in Barcelona with Pastor.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.760
Was this the last time
you won a race?

08:21.835 --> 08:24.634
Last time we won a race,
Barcelona 2012.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.341
So there's another picture of dad,
someone sent that to me,

08:27.424 --> 08:32.851
it's amazing, him lifting two wheel nuts,
how buff was my dad? It's amazing.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.775
It's was phenomenal how fit he
was before his accident.

08:36.850 --> 08:41.447
Oh this is an awful article that came out
when mum did an extract from her book.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.583
After the accident,

08:44.607 --> 08:46.951
I think Ginny was
on the edge of a nervous breakdown

08:47.027 --> 08:49.746
and she found communication,

08:49.779 --> 08:51.873
on an emotional level,
very difficult with Frank,

08:51.948 --> 08:53.245
Frank didn't do emotion

08:53.324 --> 08:55.747
and she perhaps felt that

08:55.827 --> 09:01.459
a book might be one way of
getting the story across to him.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.934
"I'm not usually given
to making New Year's resolutions"

09:11.009 --> 09:15.185
but at the end of 1988 I decided that
I would spend the following year

09:15.221 --> 09:18.065
setting down everything
that has happened to Frank and me

09:18.099 --> 09:19.521
"in the last two decades."

09:26.733 --> 09:28.531
Yes.

09:35.992 --> 09:42.170
These are the little micro tapes that,
they took about 6 hours of conversation.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.714
That goes in... there.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.873
How long is it
since you listened to these?

10:05.897 --> 10:09.572
Probably not since
I first transcribed them, which, so it is,

10:09.651 --> 10:13.781
<i>it's 25 years ago and
I mean she sounds so alive today,</i>

10:13.822 --> 10:16.871
25 years later
I can relieve that conversation.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.418
<i>I feel very sad that
she's not here anymore.</i>

10:35.093 --> 10:36.320
- Hello Pamela.
- Hello...

10:36.344 --> 10:37.863
- How are you?
- No need to ask who you are.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.060
I feel I should hug you
or kiss you or something.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.108
- Oh!
- I feel I know you so well already.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.537
Well looking at you...
I feel I know you so, really yes.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.437
Is it a bit weird.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.720
- It is weird yes.
- Really? Do I look like mum?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.820
You do.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.373
<i>It was so weird
because I didn't,</i>

10:52.402 --> 10:54.325
<i>she obviously didn't tell
anyone in the family,</i>

10:54.404 --> 10:57.658
<i>but there was all this kind
of quite suspicious behaviour going on,</i>

10:57.740 --> 11:01.119
<i>kind of sneaking out or you know
I find the Dictaphone in her glove box.</i>

11:01.202 --> 11:03.722
I was convinced she was having
an affair and confronted her with it

11:03.746 --> 11:06.670
and she still didn't tell me that
that's what she was doing.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.242
She actually met Frank

11:41.326 --> 11:44.375
about three months
before she was due to get married

11:44.454 --> 11:47.207
and that her fiancé
introduced her to Frank

11:47.290 --> 11:50.260
and there was an instant sort of
electric connection

11:50.335 --> 11:52.178
between her and Frank,

11:52.253 --> 11:54.722
she was only, I think 20,
she was very young

11:54.797 --> 11:56.219
and she thought, “What can I do?

11:56.299 --> 11:59.519
"The flowers are ordered,
the wedding oh..."

12:18.905 --> 12:24.332
Well she was blonde, blue eyes,
beautiful thick head of hair,

12:24.410 --> 12:27.505
<i>beautiful manners, beautiful clothes,
came from quite a wealthy background.</i>

12:28.665 --> 12:31.259
<i>She had
this lovely way of speaking.</i>

12:31.334 --> 12:32.460
<i>Great sense of humour.</i>

12:32.543 --> 12:35.137
And she loved motor racing,
she understood motor racing.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.591
She had a very good feel
for racing drivers.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.528
<i>Frank probably thought
you're not gonna believe it,</i>

12:41.552 --> 12:43.600
<i>she went to a finishing
school in Switzerland,</i>

12:43.680 --> 12:46.980
they've got Labradors
in the garden, I've cracked it.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.857
<i>I suspect that's what he told his mates.</i>

12:49.936 --> 12:52.189
I mean she was just
a fantastic girl to talk to,

12:52.272 --> 12:55.947
it was like talking to a fella,
but you know with, wearing Chanel No. 5

12:56.025 --> 12:57.025
it was just brilliant.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.329
But in <i>those</i> days,
to back out of a marriage

13:00.405 --> 13:03.409
or a looming wedding was
almost impossible to do,

13:03.491 --> 13:05.664
you know invitations had
gone out and stuff like that

13:05.743 --> 13:11.546
and it would've been very tough
for her to, to pull the plug on it.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.102
Anyway she went through with
the wedding

13:13.126 --> 13:16.175
but this attraction didn't go away.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.098
It was the charm,
it was the Frank William's charm I think,

13:19.173 --> 13:24.896
that smile and the big green eyes
and mum just went loony.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.116
<i>You know,
I remember going to cross</i> a <i>road</i>

13:27.140 --> 13:28.858
<i>and she's sitting in a Mini car,</i>

13:28.933 --> 13:30.035
<i>I said, “What you doing here?”</i>

13:30.059 --> 13:32.061
<i>"She said
“Brode, don't say anything to anybody"</i>

13:32.145 --> 13:35.991
and she had a flask and sandwiches and
she'd been sitting there from nine o'clock

13:36.065 --> 13:38.989
hoping Frank would go across the road
and buy a paper at the newsagents

13:39.068 --> 13:40.170
and she could get out and say.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.164
"Oh Frank,
fancy bumping into you here"

13:43.239 --> 13:46.083
and she didn't do it once,
she did it all week.

14:14.103 --> 14:18.233
It was a real magical
world, the world Frank started racing,

14:18.316 --> 14:21.866
<i>it was this, you know, boys club
and I think Frank,</i>

14:21.944 --> 14:24.447
<i>he loved being a part of it,
and maybe because</i>

14:24.530 --> 14:27.784
<i>he hadn't been a part of a,
a gang, a group</i>

14:27.867 --> 14:30.120
<i>when he was you know in his childhood.</i>

14:44.717 --> 14:47.561
<i>My father left, he was</i>
a <i>bomber pilot, left my mother.</i>

14:47.637 --> 14:49.480
<i>My mother brought me up.</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:52.149
<i>She did bring me up
pretty much single-handedly.</i>

14:52.225 --> 14:55.229
<i>They lived in
Jarrow in South Shields,</i>

14:55.311 --> 14:57.029
<i>that was a difficult environment,</i>

14:57.105 --> 15:02.362
<i>difficult to make your way out of
and my grandma made the choice,</i>

15:02.443 --> 15:06.368
she would sacrifice
the normal home environment

15:06.447 --> 15:09.166
in order to try and give dad
a better chance in life

15:09.242 --> 15:10.869
by giving him this education.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.211
<i>My first memories
were being sent to</i>

15:16.290 --> 15:20.170
a <i>Roman Catholic convent,
I was about, just coming up for five</i>

15:20.253 --> 15:21.939
<i>and I used to run away at
the railway station</i>

15:21.963 --> 15:23.690
<i>and they used to ring up
and say he's here again,</i>

15:23.714 --> 15:25.261
<i>please stop this happening again,</i>

15:25.299 --> 15:27.444
whenever I got back, the school
they took my little trousers down

15:27.468 --> 15:29.937
and hit me with a, a coat hanger.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.850
I didn't mind,
I was quite happy at the school.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.578
- You were happy at school?
- I was happy at the school, yes.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.955
So, and why did
you run away then?

15:37.979 --> 15:40.232
Uh... because
I wasn't that happy.

15:40.314 --> 15:44.194
No, but it was, I also loved trains,
I love trains and movement,

15:44.277 --> 15:45.957
<i>I was always trying
to get a ride in a car,</i>

15:45.987 --> 15:47.881
<i>you know when someone's dad
turned up with a car,</i>

15:47.905 --> 15:48.747
<i>I was all over the car</i>

15:48.781 --> 15:50.843
<i>and sometimes they gave me
a ride up and down the road in it.</i>

15:50.867 --> 15:52.619
<i>I was, I was nuts about cars by then.</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:06.316
<i>I did qualify for uni
but I had no interest,</i>

16:06.340 --> 16:09.640
because I was uh... in a convent for
three years, one year at a day school,

16:09.719 --> 16:11.596
then another nine years
locked up as well,

16:11.679 --> 16:13.306
I was kind of keen on freedom.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.905
I'd bought for £80 a racing A35,

16:20.980 --> 16:23.733
it was a hot little ship I can tell you,
very quick car

16:24.901 --> 16:27.199
<i>and that's how I got into
motor racing proper.</i>

16:28.362 --> 16:31.457
He was totally
obsessed by motor racing.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.957
<i>I mean, to a degree
that was ridiculous. Ridiculous.</i>

16:35.036 --> 16:36.036
<i>Nothing else mattered.</i>

16:36.078 --> 16:39.048
I don't think he's ever been
in a supermarket in his life.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.444
Frank, when he first went there,

16:50.468 --> 16:52.362
<i>there wasn't any room for him
so he slept in the lock ups</i>

16:52.386 --> 16:55.265
<i>down the side there in a sleeping bag.</i>

16:57.642 --> 16:58.985
<i>Everybody had a nickname.</i>

16:59.060 --> 17:02.985
<i>Roger Bunting was Bunt,
Charles Lucas was Charlie Luke,</i>

17:03.022 --> 17:07.823
Piers Courage was called Porridge,
and Franks was called Wanks.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.830
Ah is Wanks around?
No he'll be in later.

17:11.906 --> 17:12.748
Oh okay.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.457
They were all
aristocratic, wealthy guys

17:16.536 --> 17:20.632
who wanted to go motor racing
and Frank was mixing with them.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.674
And he wasn't either
aristocratic or wealthy.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.659
Well, all the other guys
that live in that flat

17:33.719 --> 17:38.065
had hereditary incomes.
Frank didn't, nor did I,

17:38.140 --> 17:39.642
<i>so Frank had to earn some money.</i>

17:39.725 --> 17:43.229
<i>So the way he earned money
was to buy and sell parts.</i>

17:43.312 --> 17:46.566
<i>And every waking moment
he was chasing around the country</i>

17:46.649 --> 17:49.493
<i>buying stuff for a pound
and selling it for 2 pound.</i>

17:49.569 --> 17:52.664
<i>He called himself Frank Williams
Racing Cars in the end.</i>

17:52.738 --> 17:54.285
The motivation behind the organisers

17:54.365 --> 17:57.960
wanting certain drivers was
that in France they had to have Matre,

17:58.035 --> 18:01.005
they had to have Beltoise
and Servoz-Gavin starting.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.333
Italy had to have a Ferrari on the grid.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.919
And I guess England
particularly wanted to be RM.

18:06.002 --> 18:09.927
He seemed to me to be
the ultimate wheeler dealer.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.555
And then he expanded
and expanded and pretty soon

18:12.633 --> 18:18.185
<i>he was selling a lot of cars
to European drivers particularly in Italy.</i>

18:18.222 --> 18:21.271
So Frank would get
a phone call from an Italian customer.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.786
<i>“Hey Franks,
what are you gonna give me</i>

18:22.810 --> 18:24.312
"for my car I need a new Brabham?"

18:24.395 --> 18:27.615
“I'll give you X for it."
“Okay, I'll come and get it."

18:27.690 --> 18:29.317
<i>He's got an order
from the same customer</i>

18:29.400 --> 18:31.198
<i>for a brand new car.</i>

18:31.277 --> 18:33.154
<i>He'd then take that car apart,</i>

18:33.237 --> 18:35.535
<i>repaint it,
re-electroplate it, re-polish it</i>

18:35.615 --> 18:40.621
and it would be, <i>3</i> months later, a totally
immaculate brand new looking car

18:40.661 --> 18:44.541
with a brand new chassis number
that he got out the back door at Brabham.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.584
The guy would then get the car back

18:46.667 --> 18:49.546
<i>and what he actually got back
was the original car.</i>

18:51.213 --> 18:55.389
I know one guy had the same car
for at least <i>3</i> years

18:55.468 --> 18:58.096
but he thought
he got a new car every year.

19:07.730 --> 19:11.325
<i>Ginny had grown up
in</i> a <i>very sheltered environment</i>

19:11.400 --> 19:15.280
and suddenly there was this man
who didn't go by the rules

19:15.363 --> 19:16.990
<i>and he was very exciting.</i>

19:21.827 --> 19:24.626
We'd go to parties on</i> a <i>Saturday night

19:24.705 --> 19:29.006
and Frank's dancing with Ginny
and it's getting obscene

19:29.085 --> 19:32.589
<i>and her husband has got
daggers coming out of his eyes</i>

19:32.672 --> 19:36.176
<i>"and I walked up to Frank and I said
“Frank, what the fuck are you doing?"</i>

19:36.258 --> 19:38.306
<i>I said you can't be doing this,
have a normal dance,</i>

19:38.386 --> 19:42.391
<i>I mean you know the only thing
he wasn't doing was having sex,</i>

19:42.473 --> 19:46.228
and Frank said, “Oh I hadn't noticed"
and Ginny said, “Well I certainly hadn't"

19:46.310 --> 19:48.688
but everybody else had.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.571
<i>And then of course the show
was on the road then with them two.</i>

19:52.650 --> 19:54.027
And she moved into a flat

19:54.110 --> 19:59.082
and then she thought,
“How do I let Frank know that I'm here?

19:59.156 --> 20:04.913
Because I mustn't let him know that I,
left my first husband because of him,

20:04.995 --> 20:06.014
"that would scare him off."

20:06.038 --> 20:10.509
<i>So he didn't drink but
what he loved was fresh orange juice,</i>

20:10.584 --> 20:12.632
<i>so she wrote a letter,</i>

20:12.712 --> 20:15.841
<i>'if you fancy some fresh orange
juice, it's now being served at... ',</i>

20:15.923 --> 20:18.642
and she put her new address
and a day or two later

20:18.718 --> 20:19.861
the doorbell rang

20:19.885 --> 20:21.512
and he turned up at the door.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.781
Looking for
some orange juice?

20:22.805 --> 20:26.605
Looking for some orange juice,
obviously.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.955
<i>And they're away...</i>

20:29.979 --> 20:31.957
<i>I saw Frank Williams
make</i> a <i>very good start from the back,</i>

20:31.981 --> 20:34.450
<i>he's now in third place
from about the third row of the grid,</i>

20:34.525 --> 20:35.617
<i>that's very good indeed.</i>

20:36.694 --> 20:37.879
<i>Back then his whole thing</i>

20:37.903 --> 20:39.871
<i>was to be
the greatest racing driver in the world.</i>

20:40.948 --> 20:42.592
<i>..who's the yellow car
sneaking through there?</i>

20:42.616 --> 20:43.458
<i>Frank Williams.</i>

20:43.534 --> 20:45.095
<i>It's Frank, look at him sneaking,</i>

20:45.119 --> 20:47.372
<i>what a battle with these two saloons.
My word...</i>

20:47.455 --> 20:49.457
He was racing saloon cars,

20:49.540 --> 20:50.507
<i>but for some reason,</i>

20:50.541 --> 20:51.685
<i>he never had an in built limit,</i>

20:51.709 --> 20:53.395
he would just go faster
and faster and faster

20:53.419 --> 20:54.420
and fly off the circuit.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.182
<i>- And who's off there?
- Frank Williams.</i>

20:57.214 --> 20:58.817
<i>Frank Williams trying too hard,</i>

20:58.841 --> 21:02.891
<i>Frank always very fast
but very hairy and he's living up to it.</i>

21:02.970 --> 21:05.018
When I started doing
uh... Formula 3

21:05.097 --> 21:07.600
sometimes I would encounter people
who would say to me

21:07.683 --> 21:09.310
do you know that chap Frank Williams?

21:09.393 --> 21:12.363
Yeah, I know Frank Williams,
oh, he's so fast and he,

21:12.438 --> 21:14.440
and he crashed here
and he overtook here

21:14.523 --> 21:15.775
and he did all kinds of things.

21:15.858 --> 21:20.159
<i>So Frank had this amazing reputation
as someone who was lightning fast,</i>

21:20.237 --> 21:22.114
<i>not always staying on the road.</i>

21:23.157 --> 21:24.926
<i>There were</i> a
<i>lot of races, he would've won,</i>

21:24.950 --> 21:27.078
<i>but he ended up spinning the car
and having accidents,</i>

21:27.161 --> 21:28.003
he just didn't have a limit

21:28.078 --> 21:30.376
and that extended
to his road driving as well.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.175
- Well what was that like?
- Diabolical.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.093
Where did you learn to drive?

21:38.172 --> 21:40.925
<i>In my mother's Morris 1000,</i>

21:41.008 --> 21:43.636
<i>she was very reluctant to lend it to me,</i>

21:43.719 --> 21:46.563
<i>and she was right because in the end
I did roll it on its roof.</i>

21:46.639 --> 21:48.408
But you rolled a few cars in your time.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.025
Not that many, no.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.745
Well it's just
that every time we talk about a car

21:51.769 --> 21:53.737
it seems to be one that you've rolled.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.916
Well I haven't talked about
that many cars though have I?

21:55.940 --> 21:58.864
But didn't you,
what was your first racing car'?

21:58.943 --> 22:00.945
- A35.
- What happened to that?

22:01.028 --> 22:02.348
That got rolled.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.626
<i>He was nothing but competitive,
against himself in</i> a <i>road car,</i>

22:07.660 --> 22:09.971
<i>it was almost at the point,
where he would start a stopwatch to see</i>

22:09.995 --> 22:13.169
<i>if he could beat
his previous time from A to B.</i>

22:35.020 --> 22:36.832
And I think it dawned on him that

22:36.856 --> 22:38.403
pretty soon he was gonna hurt himself,

22:38.482 --> 22:43.659
you can't have that many accidents
on the road and in the, on race tracks,

22:43.737 --> 22:45.799
you know you end up hurting yourself,
especially back then

22:45.823 --> 22:47.325
when the cars were lethal.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.419
<i>What got me into Formula 1
was only the fact</i>

22:57.459 --> 23:02.340
that after two or three years of racing
rather dangerously around the continent

23:02.381 --> 23:05.351
it became apparent
that I might have lots of uh... courage

23:05.426 --> 23:07.349
but nothing like enough skill
to go with it.

23:07.428 --> 23:11.308
<i>At the same time I became very friendly
with</i> a <i>young man called Piers Courage</i>

23:11.390 --> 23:13.643
<i>who was a brilliant driver.</i>

23:13.726 --> 23:15.728
And the opportunity came for Frank

23:15.811 --> 23:20.317
<i>to build a Formula 1 car
and Piers agreed to drive it.</i>

23:20.399 --> 23:24.575
And then Piers and I set off in 1969.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.832
<i>Piers Courage
was an ebullient,</i>

23:32.912 --> 23:35.256
<i>fashionable Formula 1 driver</i>

23:35.331 --> 23:38.881
<i>that captured the imagination
of everybody who loved Formula 1</i>

23:38.959 --> 23:43.214
and Piers was just, Frank's idea of
what a Grand Prix driver should be like.

23:44.214 --> 23:47.684
<i>He was just bouncy,
easily charming,</i>

23:47.760 --> 23:50.434
<i>had a beautiful wife
whom half of London was chasing.</i>

23:50.512 --> 23:52.282
Apart from being</i> a <i>great looking fella,

23:52.306 --> 23:54.400
<i>never had a hair or
a piece of clothes out of place,</i>

23:54.475 --> 23:56.523
he was always the smartest guy,

23:56.602 --> 24:01.779
buttoned down blazer, grey flannels,
Gucci shoes, he looked almost holy.

24:01.857 --> 24:02.918
<i>And I remember him
making</i> a <i>speech,</i>

24:02.942 --> 24:05.741
he had a slight sort of
English public school stammer

24:05.819 --> 24:07.867
and I remember the interviewer
saying “So Piers,

24:07.947 --> 24:09.620
"how's your car gonna go
this weekend?"

24:09.698 --> 24:12.618
"And he said, “Well I think it'll go
like an absolute b-b-b bomb actually."

24:16.664 --> 24:19.713
Hoping to go one better
than his second placing <i>last</i> year

24:19.792 --> 24:21.635
<i>was Piers Courage
in the very promising.</i>

24:21.710 --> 24:23.508
<i>Frank Williams backed De Tomaso.</i>

24:23.587 --> 24:25.635
<i>I remember last year, my right foot</i>

24:25.714 --> 24:27.591
terrific cramp in, cramp in it

24:27.675 --> 24:30.770
and also the great blisters
on my hands from the gear changing.

24:30.844 --> 24:34.144
<i>Well I kind of adored Piers
in many ways but in those days...</i>

24:34.181 --> 24:36.900
it was "Piers is wonderful,
this is my mate."

24:36.976 --> 24:38.148
I thought the world of him.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.735
<i>Piers and Frank were great together,</i>

24:45.818 --> 24:48.913
<i>they were almost made
for each other I think,</i>

24:48.988 --> 24:51.958
<i>you had Piers who was
really developing as a driver</i>

24:52.032 --> 24:56.003
<i>and Frank was really developing
as a team owner, constructor.</i>

24:58.539 --> 25:01.463
<i>Second place at Monte Carlo,
can you believe that?</i>

25:01.500 --> 25:03.798
<i>Second place the US Grand Prix,
can you believe that?</i>

25:03.877 --> 25:05.925
<i>5th at Silverstone, a great run.</i>

25:07.840 --> 25:11.686
<i>Everybody wanted to be a
racing driver and Piers was on his way,</i>

25:11.760 --> 25:13.808
<i>he'd beaten
Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark</i>

25:13.887 --> 25:16.686
and he was a really, really good driver.

25:16.765 --> 25:22.693
♪ Lark Ascending <i>J'</i>
♪ Vaughan Williams ♪

25:29.361 --> 25:33.537
And suddenly he dies in this horrendous
accident in Frank's car.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.747
<i>I</i> was <i>in</i> the race

25:39.830 --> 25:46.384
and it was a terrible accident
involving us knowing that it was Piers

25:46.420 --> 25:48.673
that had the accident
because his helmet came off.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.864
And when you heard the news,

25:55.888 --> 25:58.107
how did you hear the news?

25:58.140 --> 26:01.861
Well it was, all I will say is that it was
a major shock,

26:01.935 --> 26:04.984
I was very young, you don't
expect a shock like that

26:05.022 --> 26:06.750
and I remembered,
I went to the race organiser,

26:06.774 --> 26:09.744
a man called John Corschmidt

26:09.818 --> 26:13.698
and I said,
“John, just tell me is Piers dead?

26:13.781 --> 26:15.533
"Are you sure he's dead?"

26:15.616 --> 26:18.290
And he said I'm sure
and I said tell me that again,

26:18.368 --> 26:21.588
he told me, “He is dead Frank",
three times, I said "OK"

26:21.622 --> 26:25.126
and I got up and I had the job of telling
his wife, Piers' wife,

26:25.209 --> 26:27.007
and I'd rather not talk about that.

26:31.423 --> 26:36.224
<i>His wife, Sally,
was in a terrible state.</i>

26:36.261 --> 26:42.064
Wives in motor racing I think have had a
much tougher life than any driver has.

26:43.685 --> 26:47.110
And I remember going
to the funeral and Frank was fantastic,

26:47.189 --> 26:50.068
<i>he stood at the entrance of the church
and welcomed everybody in,</i>

26:50.150 --> 26:51.743
<i>and there were a lot of people,</i>

26:51.819 --> 26:54.197
shook hands with everybody,
thanked them for coming.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.828
And then after the ceremony
we couldn't find him

26:56.907 --> 26:59.376
and I walked back into the church, it was
deserted

26:59.451 --> 27:04.753
and Frank was standing behind a big
stone pillar, absolutely destroyed,

27:04.832 --> 27:07.335
standing
there weeping his heart out

27:07.417 --> 27:10.261
"and I said “Come
on love, let's go home."

27:10.337 --> 27:13.637
And it was like
that happy-go-lucky scene we had,

27:13.715 --> 27:15.638
<i>just dissolved like that.</i>

27:18.804 --> 27:21.148
But I know that, you know,
it wasn't really mentioned in,

27:21.223 --> 27:23.851
Piers wasn't mentioned
terribly much at home,

27:23.934 --> 27:27.029
I'm not sure dad ever,
I'm not sure how you would get over

27:27.062 --> 27:29.235
a driver dying in your car.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.079
<i>This ability of Frank to carry on,</i>

27:35.154 --> 27:39.534
<i>for me ifs fairly standard
in motor racing, knowing racing people,</i>

27:39.616 --> 27:44.042
<i>most of them only think of tomorrow,
very rarely do they look back</i>

27:44.121 --> 27:48.547
<i>and very rarely do they allow
emotion to come into their motivation.</i>

27:50.669 --> 27:52.564
<i>There was</i>
a <i>very high mortality rate,</i>

27:52.588 --> 27:54.056
<i>stupidly high</i>

27:54.131 --> 27:57.305
and it was just accepted that
you probably weren't gonna survive,

27:57.342 --> 28:01.142
I personally did not think I would
survive my Formula 1 career

28:01.180 --> 28:02.557
and the odds weren't very good.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.440
<i>On the second lap, disaster strikes,</i>

28:07.519 --> 28:11.444
<i>Von Trips loses control
but the race goes on.</i>

28:15.194 --> 28:17.788
<i>Those cars were effectively death traps,</i>

28:17.863 --> 28:19.090
<i>if you had a head-on in one of those</i>

28:19.114 --> 28:20.991
<i>they folded up
round you like an envelope,</i>

28:21.074 --> 28:22.166
You didn't get out of them.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.542
<i>The cars so readily caught fire,</i>

28:26.580 --> 28:29.049
the fuel systems in a minor impact

28:29.124 --> 28:32.719
nearly always sprung a leak
and the fires were the thing.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.805
<i>We had</i> a <i>series of deaths,</i>

28:38.884 --> 28:44.607
<i>one each weekend for four consecutive
weekends, four of our friends died.</i>

28:48.310 --> 28:52.611
<i>The ethos of Formula 1
was back then, this happens,</i>

28:52.689 --> 28:55.943
<i>ifs appalling but we, you know,
we're going to the next race,</i>

28:56.026 --> 28:58.199
like falling off a horse,
you climb back on again.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.589
So this is an article, gosh,

29:09.665 --> 29:12.259
dad did an interview with
The Times after Ayrton died.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.855
'Formula 1,
one of the most powerful figures

29:15.879 --> 29:17.096
in Formula 1 bares his soul

29:17.172 --> 29:20.551
on his star driver's death
and the revival of his team.'

29:22.135 --> 29:25.560
Dad says, “It hasn't all sunk in yet,
you <i>see,</i> the fact of Ayrton's death,

29:25.639 --> 29:28.688
the same slowness of thought
helped me get over my own accident,

29:28.767 --> 29:32.567
"I suppose that is why I'm so calm
about expressing the fact that he's dead."

29:33.772 --> 29:35.875
<i>The former
world motor racing champion,</i>

29:35.899 --> 29:38.994
<i>Ayrton Senna,
has been pronounced clinically dead.</i>

29:39.069 --> 29:42.664
<i>Senna suffered serious head injuries
when his car left the track</i>

29:42.739 --> 29:44.958
and crashed into a concrete
wall.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.793
<i>I remember at Ayrton's memorial service.</i>

29:49.871 --> 29:54.798
Mum said don't you dare cry,
she said this is not your time to be sad,

29:54.876 --> 29:56.628
she said this is not your loss.

29:58.630 --> 30:03.056
<i>Mum was a very loving lady
but she was very much of that mentality,</i>

30:03.135 --> 30:06.514
<i>stiff upper lip, exactly like dad.</i>

30:06.596 --> 30:09.475
I think they both probably
thought that emotion was weak.

30:11.852 --> 30:15.322
Well I mean it's not common
for men to show emotion,

30:15.397 --> 30:18.822
serious emotion,
maybe anger but that's about all,

30:18.900 --> 30:21.403
I mean you should never start crying
or any of that stuff.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.381
Never,
you should never start crying or...?

30:23.405 --> 30:24.827
We, I was, I was,

30:24.906 --> 30:27.910
I shed a few tears
when Piers was killed definitely.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.667
Mm... And when Ayrton,
when Ayrton died,

30:30.746 --> 30:32.248
I mean they're my responsibility.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.299
- When Ayrton died?
- Yeah sure.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.001
But, er, it was out responsibility,

30:36.084 --> 30:39.634
<i>he was in a racing car
operated by us, as was Piers.</i>

30:39.713 --> 30:42.557
Yeah it was a Williams operated car.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.885
And so how did you feel
on that day?

30:44.968 --> 30:45.968
Far from well.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.090
<i>Here he comes down the outside,</i>

31:06.114 --> 31:08.458
<i>that's a brave place to try and overtake.</i>

31:08.533 --> 31:11.377
Oh mama mia, mama mia,
oh they're gonna touch.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.706
<i>Bottas has</i> a <i>line!
They hit! They hit!</i>

31:13.789 --> 31:16.668
- <i>And Raikkonen's off this time.
- Good, fuck off.</i>

31:19.086 --> 31:23.341
We are operating on a budget of
approximately 110 million Sterling a year.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.302
And the likes of Red Bull
and Ferrari and Mercedes

31:26.385 --> 31:28.763
are operating on two
if not three times that budget.

31:28.845 --> 31:32.145
<i>So from</i> a <i>financial perspective
you could call us an underdog,</i>

31:32.224 --> 31:34.727
<i>I think that's the,
the negative connotation for me</i>

31:34.810 --> 31:38.155
<i>is it gives this sense that Williams
are weaker than anyone else,</i>

31:38.230 --> 31:42.076
but we're not, we've been through
a lot more than a lot of teams on the grid

31:42.150 --> 31:43.697
and we've always come out fighting.

31:43.777 --> 31:47.873
<i>And it's Bottas
who finishes in third place,</i>

31:47.948 --> 31:51.669
<i>superb podium for him after
the incident with Raikkonen earlier...</i>

31:51.701 --> 31:53.669
<i>Finally,</i>
a <i>podium for Williams.</i>

31:53.745 --> 31:56.874
So happy, my heart hasn't stopped
going yet, that was quite intense...

31:58.375 --> 32:02.300
Third place from Finland, Valtteri Bottas.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.737
<i>And</i> did
your mum get to see you <i>in</i> this role?

32:09.761 --> 32:13.766
No she didn't, um which...

32:16.184 --> 32:19.529
you know for me is really sad,
it's kind of heart breaking really.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.575
<i>I'm sad about that but Pm more sad that
she hasn't seen the team turn around,</i>

32:23.650 --> 32:26.529
<i>because that was
what she desperately wanted to see</i>

32:26.611 --> 32:28.659
<i>that broke her heart really at the end.</i>

32:57.559 --> 32:59.778
<i>I began to realise that
if I do want a wife</i>

32:59.853 --> 33:02.447
that she was the best
I was ever likely to find.

33:18.121 --> 33:22.171
Well it wasn't, it wasn't a posh wedding,
you know with white stuff everywhere,

33:22.250 --> 33:26.721
it was a, what do you call that thing,
a reg, a reg, registry whatever.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.232
- A registry office.
- Thank you very much.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.305
<i>I think dad had said that
he would son' the registry office out</i>

33:31.384 --> 33:34.513
and never did and would get the rings
but he didn't have any money

33:34.596 --> 33:37.145
so Mum had to borrow money from

33:37.182 --> 33:39.981
um Dave Brodie
I think it was that bought the ring.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.038
So that's it, I went there
quarter of an hour early,

33:42.062 --> 33:44.736
gave them £8.00, never got that back,
didn't expect it back.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.317
<i>It was all over in 15 minutes.</i>

33:47.400 --> 33:48.868
<i>Her parents certainly weren't there,</i>

33:48.902 --> 33:53.408
I'm not sure they approved
uh... of the match.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.620
Out we went
and I said, "Oh this a great day",

33:57.661 --> 34:01.256
let's have a celebration, I'm
gonna buy you all a spectacular lunch."

34:01.331 --> 34:03.584
Frank said,
“Not me you're not, I'm working”

34:03.667 --> 34:06.011
and he fucked off, that was it..

34:06.086 --> 34:08.589
I don't know what man
in his right mind

34:08.672 --> 34:11.641
would think that that was OK
but you know Dad did,

34:11.716 --> 34:14.469
and Dad went back to work
and Mum went to lunch

34:14.553 --> 34:17.181
and probably really
didn't think very much of it,

34:17.264 --> 34:18.982
because she was used to it by then.

34:19.849 --> 34:24.480
<i>Dad is a completely different beast
to most normal men.</i>

34:27.065 --> 34:29.159
<i>Frank from when
I first met him was,</i>

34:29.234 --> 34:31.657
<i>always seemed very fit and athletic</i>

34:31.735 --> 34:34.831
and he was forever running, every
night was a long run.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.469
<i>He ran every circuit that
we were at the race track,</i>

34:38.493 --> 34:41.292
he used to run round it
and he felt bad if he didn't,

34:41.371 --> 34:42.811
you know it was like a drug for him.

34:44.373 --> 34:47.503
<i>Frank is very,
what would be called focused,</i>

34:47.585 --> 34:49.554
<i>some people could say narrow,</i>

34:49.629 --> 34:53.132
I mean, some people
find Frank a bit unusual now

34:53.216 --> 34:58.393
and think it's because of the accident,
well it isn't, he was always very unusual.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.734
<i>In Frank
there 's</i> a <i>huge amount of repression,</i>

35:02.809 --> 35:05.028
<i>there's a huge amount of determination.</i>

35:05.061 --> 35:09.737
<i>There's an extraordinary retentive
obsessiveness.</i>

35:09.816 --> 35:11.659
<i>I suppose,
motor racing people in general</i>

35:11.735 --> 35:15.205
<i>are the most intensely competitive people,
I've ever known.</i>

35:15.280 --> 35:18.329
They're not
very mature intellectually or culturally

35:18.408 --> 35:22.288
because they neither read nor think
uh... very much except about

35:22.370 --> 35:26.500
what they actually do to which
they think in an extraordinary degree.

35:32.047 --> 35:37.224
I've never been close to Frank socially.
I mean, we've never...

35:37.260 --> 35:40.184
I don't, I don't think
we've ever been out for dinner together.

35:40.263 --> 35:44.564
He felt that anything
that involved socialising

35:44.643 --> 35:47.647
and having a drink or relaxing
was actually a waste of time.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.801
“I am addicted to motor racing",

36:00.825 --> 36:02.827
Frank Williams
declared uncompromisingly,

36:02.911 --> 36:06.211
motor racing is what matters
most in my life and then he goes,

36:06.289 --> 36:08.417
“Well I have a family which
I love very much,

36:08.500 --> 36:11.003
but they tend
to take second place to the business,

36:11.086 --> 36:13.930
"there's no question about that".

36:15.340 --> 36:18.685
But did you used to do
the family holiday type thing?

36:18.760 --> 36:19.977
Never done that, never.

36:20.053 --> 36:23.148
Oh it's too late now anyway,
never interested in that.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.818
Oh my god,
well this is embarrassing,

36:26.893 --> 36:29.612
Mum wanted a hotel
to take the three kids to

36:29.688 --> 36:32.532
and family tradition was
to have a picture of all of us

36:32.607 --> 36:34.905
on the balcony with Mum,
so that's me and Mum there,

36:34.984 --> 36:38.579
so would've been when I was
16, look at me, horrendous.

36:38.655 --> 36:43.786
So in total we went to Marbella
with mum 32 times, 32 years.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.791
How many times did your dad come?

36:45.870 --> 36:48.373
Never, not once.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.460
And that didn't bother you?
No.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.814
Mum always used to tell us,
there's no point having your father here

36:54.838 --> 36:56.715
because he would drive us all mad,

36:56.798 --> 36:59.176
so we just used to go down there
and we had a lovely time.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.523
Can you get that wheel,
fast as you can, the bottom one.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.447
Joe have we got
another wheel mounted?

37:33.084 --> 37:35.803
<i>Frank endured</i>
a <i>lot of piss taking for his efforts</i>

37:35.879 --> 37:38.098
<i>and you know
he was the poor northerner</i>

37:38.173 --> 37:40.471
<i>that didn't have a pot to piss in</i>

37:40.550 --> 37:44.896
and his cars were rubbish and, you know,
he didn't have half the parts for them.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.773
<i>Frank couldn't afford new tyres</i>

37:49.851 --> 37:54.448
and was racing
with second hand Firestone tyres I think.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.696
I wish they'd ban
tyres, there's just too many.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.379
If Ginny hadn't been there,

38:00.403 --> 38:02.906
Williams wouldn't have made it,
cause a lot of the money

38:02.989 --> 38:04.491
that kept it going was hers.

38:24.385 --> 38:28.765
I remember Ginny gave him £8.00 once

38:28.848 --> 38:31.601
<i>to go out and buy some fish and chips,
I think it was</i>

38:31.684 --> 38:35.109
and he went out and bought
eight Champion sparking plugs

38:35.188 --> 38:36.986
and never came back for three days.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.614
No I don't think my parents were
happy when they learnt

38:39.692 --> 38:44.198
that she'd sold her flat to help Frank
and to give him a bit of the money.

38:46.241 --> 38:49.120
<i>If there was
a common denominator through</i>

38:49.202 --> 38:54.959
the first decade of his relationship
with Virginia, would be penury.

39:11.432 --> 39:14.151
<i>Frank Williams' team
is at its lowest ebb</i>

39:14.227 --> 39:17.151
<i>the cars are well down the grid
in seventh and ninth places.</i>

39:26.406 --> 39:28.374
Frank came round to see me

39:28.449 --> 39:30.577
<i>"and said “Brode I can't carry on"</i>

39:30.660 --> 39:33.755
and he had a bit of paper
with debts on it and they were huge,

39:34.747 --> 39:38.377
<i>and then overnight uh... this guy
who had been creeping around with Frank</i>

39:38.459 --> 39:40.962
<i>and giving him
little bits of money, Walter Wolf,</i>

39:41.045 --> 39:43.548
<i>did something that happens
in business all the time.</i>

39:45.717 --> 39:48.140
<i>Walter bought out Frank's debt</i>

39:48.219 --> 39:52.019
<i>and took control
of the Williams Formula 1 team.</i>

39:52.098 --> 39:55.773
<i>Walter was clearly</i>
a <i>pretty clever business man</i>

39:55.852 --> 39:59.106
<i>he'd made a fortune many, many
tens of millions by himself.</i>

39:59.188 --> 40:01.532
I thought let's give this a crack.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.782
<i>But by half way through 1976,</i>

40:04.861 --> 40:09.037
<i>it was very plain to Walter
that the race team wasn't running well,</i>

40:09.115 --> 40:14.667
<i>and that Frank didn't have
the capability to turn it around.</i>

40:15.705 --> 40:17.224
And then Frank went to the factory,

40:17.248 --> 40:18.875
<i>put his key in the front door,</i>

40:18.958 --> 40:21.461
<i>it wouldn't work. Then,
the side window opened and a guy said,</i>

40:21.544 --> 40:23.939
<i>“Frank that's your things there, you can't
come into the factory,</i>

40:23.963 --> 40:25.636
<i>you're banned from the factory now”.</i>

40:25.715 --> 40:28.110
He couldn't believe it, he'd been
locked out of his own factory,

40:28.134 --> 40:31.809
it was his life, his life was in that box
and inside that factory.

40:35.308 --> 40:40.030
<i>And then six weeks later, Frank's car,
which was renamed 'The Wolf',</i>

40:40.104 --> 40:44.075
<i>went down to South America
won its first</i> race.

40:47.153 --> 40:50.703
The thing that Frank had been living for,
for all those years.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.809
One day,
Ginny phoned me up and she said,

41:13.888 --> 41:17.688
“Brode I've got a lot of problems
with Frank, he's in a fit of depression,

41:17.767 --> 41:19.940
"he hasn't got out of
his pyjamas for six weeks."

41:21.813 --> 41:25.238
<i>Sol turned up 11 o'clock
and I looked at him and I said,</i>

41:25.316 --> 41:27.034
<i>“What the fuck's going on here Frank?</i>

41:27.110 --> 41:28.657
<i>"You've got your pyjamas on."</i>

41:28.736 --> 41:34.459
"And he said “Brode, I can't quite
get my mind together about things"

41:34.534 --> 41:36.628
and I knew what was killing him.

41:56.305 --> 41:57.602
<i>I said to Frank,</i>

41:57.682 --> 42:00.119
<i>"“Look there must be some way
you can get into Formula 1 again."</i>

42:00.143 --> 42:02.121
"And he said “Well I don't know,
I don't know" he said,

42:02.145 --> 42:06.901
“but I've been thinking about it
and I might be able to get 185,000

42:06.983 --> 42:10.112
out of a Belgian beer company
called Belle-Vue

42:10.194 --> 42:14.199
<i>but we'd have to have a Belgian guy
called Patrick Néve as driver.”</i>

42:14.282 --> 42:17.456
"I said “So what?
That's the start of a new Formula 1 team."

42:17.535 --> 42:18.971
“Do you think so?“
I said, “Yeah Frank“,

42:18.995 --> 42:22.374
"I said “get out of them poxy pyjamas
and go to work, do what you're best at."

42:28.337 --> 42:30.024
We sat
at my kitchen table and I said right,

42:30.048 --> 42:32.642
"“You do a list of Formula 1 team
names and I'll do a list."

42:32.717 --> 42:35.220
And what was the name
that you came up with?

42:35.261 --> 42:38.686
Oh it was really tough,
very testing, very brain stretching

42:38.765 --> 42:41.109
but we kept it
Williams Grand Prix Operating Limited.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.747
I said
“Right I'm taking 2 days off.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.990
We're gonna go find a factory."
"Yeah!" he went.

43:07.752 --> 43:10.346
<i>It was very much
hand to mouth but uh...</i>

43:10.379 --> 43:12.222
I loved what I was doing

43:12.298 --> 43:14.458
I'm very optimistic
and I felt it would all come right.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.072
At the end of the day,
when you're a racer, you're a racer,

43:18.096 --> 43:20.224
- it's a bit of a bug.
- A bug?

43:21.766 --> 43:22.767
It gets you.

43:40.201 --> 43:43.580
<i>140,000 fans packed into Silverstone,</i>

43:43.663 --> 43:47.713
so Hamilton's on the right as we
look at it, Nico Rosburg on the left,

43:47.792 --> 43:51.171
the British Grand Prix
about to get under way,

43:51.254 --> 43:53.552
lights out, away we go
and who's it gonna be,

43:53.631 --> 43:55.776
it's a good start from the second row,
the Williams and Massa,

43:55.800 --> 43:58.895
<i>Williams out getting
both cars past both Mercedes.</i>

43:58.970 --> 44:00.739
<i>Massa leads,
Bottas trying to get</i>

44:00.763 --> 44:01.935
<i>second from Hamilton,</i>

44:02.014 --> 44:04.392
<i>Hamilton in a bit
of trouble but he's fighting back</i>

44:04.475 --> 44:08.730
<i>but we have a race on our hands,
what a start from the Williams guys.</i>

44:10.022 --> 44:12.417
- I think Valtteri is quicker.
- He is quicker, he should pass them.

44:12.441 --> 44:13.561
He should pass them.

44:13.609 --> 44:15.828
Be careful, <i>be</i> careful! And he's off!

44:15.903 --> 44:18.281
<i>Hamilton goes off in his attempts
to try and rest the lead</i>

44:18.364 --> 44:21.038
<i>and that might give an
opportunity here for Valtteri Bottas.</i>

44:21.117 --> 44:23.461
<i>Bottas goes into second place.</i>

44:24.662 --> 44:27.962
<i>And up front ifs Williams
one and two at the moment.</i>

44:35.339 --> 44:37.262
<i>Bottas comes in from the</i> race <i>lead</i>

44:37.300 --> 44:39.644
as <i>Lewis Hamilton
continues around the track,</i>

44:39.719 --> 44:43.394
<i>let's see how the stop goes
for Valtteri Bottas, ifs pretty good,</i>

44:43.472 --> 44:46.692
<i>Hamilton's already along the start
finish straight, he's alongside,</i>

44:46.767 --> 44:50.943
<i>Hamilton retakes the lead
and where does Bottas come back out?</i>

44:50.980 --> 44:55.030
<i>He comes back out behind
his team mate, Felipe Massa.</i>

44:55.109 --> 44:57.828
<i>Oh, Hamilton is pulling away in front.</i>

45:03.826 --> 45:07.046
<i>Lewis Hamilton
wins the British Grand Prix,</i>

45:07.121 --> 45:09.123
<i>he had to fight for it,</i>

45:09.207 --> 45:13.007
<i>ultimately Williams have
to settle for fourth and fifth</i>

45:13.085 --> 45:15.383
<i>but you have to feel for Williams.</i>

46:08.307 --> 46:12.312
<i>Patrick Head is
the technical genius inside Williams,</i>

46:12.395 --> 46:13.738
<i>the engineer swot who</i>

46:13.813 --> 46:16.908
<i>bestows power
on the charismatic leader.</i>

46:21.570 --> 46:24.699
When I met Patrick,
which is the best thing,

46:24.740 --> 46:26.538
apart from marrying the wife I married,

46:26.617 --> 46:28.512
was the best day
to ever happen to me in my life.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.584
<i>He was a gifted engineer.</i>

46:31.580 --> 46:37.132
<i>Patrick is</i> a <i>person who,
he doesn't suffer fools gladly...</i>

46:37.211 --> 46:38.772
Oh he's</i> a <i>bully, if he wanted it

46:38.796 --> 46:41.219
<i>and it wasn't coming
he'd bully his way through.</i>

46:41.299 --> 46:42.651
<i>A lot of people are frightened of him,</i>

46:42.675 --> 46:45.849
<i>you know he's a broad guy
and he can be quite aggressive looking</i>

46:45.928 --> 46:51.401
but his character is not one that
junior employees found comfortable,

46:51.475 --> 46:54.274
you know what I mean, they knew when
they had made a mistake.

46:54.353 --> 46:59.359
<i>I think most of
my father's forbears were military,</i>

46:59.442 --> 47:04.994
<i>one of them General Michael Head
had been a soldier under Wellington,</i>

47:05.072 --> 47:11.546
I think not wanting to fail was a very
strong motivation.

47:11.620 --> 47:16.046
This car's half a second slower
on the stop watch than the other car.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.217
Yeah.

47:24.342 --> 47:28.472
<i>The thing that was unique,
that Patrick brought to the show,</i>

47:28.554 --> 47:33.060
he was responsible
for making Formula 1 reliable.

47:33.100 --> 47:37.901
So Frank's cars
almost instantly finish races,

47:37.980 --> 47:39.482
which they hadn't been doing before

47:39.565 --> 47:42.819
and that's
where life changed for Williams.

47:45.196 --> 47:48.700
<i>The British</i> teams <i>have
kept ahead with innovative designs,</i>

47:48.741 --> 47:51.870
<i>the most recent
being the aerodynamic skirt,</i>

47:51.952 --> 47:54.080
a <i>rigid panel that scrapes
along the ground</i>

47:54.163 --> 47:56.211
<i>between the front and rear wheels,</i>

47:56.290 --> 47:59.134
<i>creating a phenomenon
called ground effect.</i>

48:01.879 --> 48:03.506
<i>For Frank Dernie a simple graph</i>

48:03.589 --> 48:07.560
<i>shows the rise in suction
under the Williams wood skirts.</i>

48:07.635 --> 48:11.356
If you remove the skirt you actually
get so little flow in this area...

48:11.430 --> 48:13.367
The thing
that really made a big difference

48:13.391 --> 48:15.689
was a fairing
along the side of the engine

48:15.768 --> 48:17.441
which allowed
the flow to remain attached

48:17.520 --> 48:20.945
<i>all the way to the back and I tested
that in a wind tunnel test</i>

48:20.981 --> 48:24.076
<i>just before Silverstone in 1979</i>

48:24.151 --> 48:28.497
and it was the biggest gain
of performance I've ever seen on a car

48:28.572 --> 48:31.416
so I rushed back from the wind tunnel
and drew the parts

48:31.492 --> 48:33.995
and we got them made so we
could use them at Silverstone.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.517
<i>I remember going out there</i>

48:38.541 --> 48:40.009
<i>and hopping in it for the first time</i>

48:40.084 --> 48:41.461
<i>and thinking bloody hell.</i>

48:41.502 --> 48:43.397
What was
the difference with the car'?

48:43.421 --> 48:47.301
It was better
it was just better.

48:47.383 --> 48:48.777
Don't start getting me,
trying to be technical

48:48.801 --> 48:50.974
because I'll look like a complete goose.

48:51.053 --> 48:55.604
<i>We went to the test
and in the morning</i>,

48:55.683 --> 48:59.313
everybody had been running and I think
the best lap time would of been uh...,

48:59.395 --> 49:04.151
I dunno 12.9 or something
by somebody and Alan went out,

49:04.233 --> 49:08.784
I remember the time absolutely,
he did a one minute 11.88 just like that,

49:08.821 --> 49:12.746
bang, and the rest of the pit lane
were doing mid 13s

49:12.825 --> 49:15.512
and it was most peculiar because
you were standing there with your thing

49:15.536 --> 49:18.380
and everybody went...
and looked down at us,

49:18.456 --> 49:20.925
they couldn't,
they just could not believe it.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.805
<i>In practice,
Alan Jones in the Saudia Williams</i>

49:33.888 --> 49:37.142
<i>has slashed an incredible
seven seconds off the record,</i>

49:37.183 --> 49:39.857
<i>and that's a lot these days.</i>

49:39.935 --> 49:41.562
<i>Alan was</i> a <i>man's man,</i>

49:41.645 --> 49:43.739
he was an Aussie,
it's all you expect from an Aussie,

49:43.814 --> 49:45.942
maybe you know big character,
strong personality,

49:46.025 --> 49:48.403
<i>took no nonsense from anybody.</i>

49:48.486 --> 49:50.909
He liked his fun, he liked to drink,

49:50.988 --> 49:54.788
<i>though I think he always had</i> a <i>bit of</i>
a <i>struggle keeping his weight down.</i>

49:54.867 --> 49:56.869
After a race
you'd nearly always see him

49:56.952 --> 49:59.876
pouring a beer down
his throat or two or three.

49:59.955 --> 50:02.434
In motor sport there's two good
reasons to have a bit of a drink,

50:02.458 --> 50:04.301
one is to commiserate
and one is to celebrate,

50:04.376 --> 50:06.925
so you're pretty safe either way
you're gonna have a beer.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.427
Two Williams <i>in</i> the first two rows,

50:09.507 --> 50:12.977
<i>the incredible veteran,
the Swiss driver, Clay Regazzoni.</i>

50:13.052 --> 50:14.696
<i>Well Clay's
not as quick as he used to be</i>

50:14.720 --> 50:16.313
<i>he's now very much
a number 2 driver</i>

50:16.388 --> 50:18.641
<i>he's number 2 to Alan Jones
in the Williams team.</i>

50:19.683 --> 50:21.651
<i>We all sort of expected Regazzoni</i>

50:21.727 --> 50:23.980
<i>to be quicker than Jones
but he never was.</i>

50:24.021 --> 50:26.194
Jones turned out
to be much, much better

50:26.273 --> 50:28.275
than any of us had realised I think.

50:28.359 --> 50:32.865
<i>Now</i> all ready
for the <i>68</i> lap British Grand <i>Prix.</i>

50:37.076 --> 50:40.751
<i>And punching through,
it's the two Saudia Williams cars,</i>

50:40.829 --> 50:44.709
<i>first into Copse Corner and
they're coming through, that's Jabouifle.</i>

50:44.792 --> 50:47.011
<i>Jean-Pierre Jabouille
is going to go through,</i>

50:47.086 --> 50:49.054
<i>he's got tremendous speed
and power here.</i>

50:49.129 --> 50:54.056
<i>510 horsepower and it is still,
Alan Jones leads now.</i>

50:54.134 --> 50:56.887
<i>When Alan took the lead
quite quickly and just disappeared,</i>

50:56.971 --> 51:00.817
Patrick and I were just counting the laps,
praying for the laps to keep reducing

51:00.891 --> 51:04.566
because it, there was a new car,
it wasn't necessarily reliable,

51:04.645 --> 51:07.524
and witnessed what was about
to be a major event for the team.

51:07.606 --> 51:10.610
<i>This became a reality.</i>

51:10.693 --> 51:14.118
And Alan Jones pulling away <i>now.</i>

51:14.196 --> 51:18.121
<i>Well I was leading very
comfortably but then all of a sudden,</i>

51:18.200 --> 51:20.419
in the rear view mirrors
I saw a hell of a lot of smoke

51:20.494 --> 51:21.721
coming out of the back of the car

51:21.745 --> 51:23.348
and I thought there was
something wrong for sure.

51:23.372 --> 51:28.378
And that is trouble for Alan Jones

51:28.460 --> 51:33.011
<i>and he, the way he's coasting,
it looks as though he's burst his engine.</i>

51:33.090 --> 51:34.818
<i>I mean I should've
hung around for the end of the race</i>

51:34.842 --> 51:37.686
but I was that pissed off
I just jumped in my car

51:37.761 --> 51:40.139
and went back to London
at about 300 mile an hour.

51:44.059 --> 51:46.437
So <i>Clay</i> Regazzoni
<i>is</i> the new leader

51:46.520 --> 51:49.524
<i>of the 33rd British Grand Prix.</i>

51:51.150 --> 51:55.906
<i>Clay Regazzoni almost home
to win the first race ever</i>

51:55.988 --> 52:01.210
<i>for the Williams team and Frank Williams
will be beside himself with joy.</i>

52:01.285 --> 52:04.255
<i>And Clay Regazzoni
goes across the line</i>

52:04.330 --> 52:07.459
<i>and he has won the British Grand Prix.</i>

52:07.499 --> 52:09.126
We were so much quicker
than anyone else,

52:09.209 --> 52:11.803
even though Clay
was nowhere near as fast as Alan

52:11.879 --> 52:14.052
<i>and of course
when Alan broke down he won.</i>

52:15.924 --> 52:17.892
We won</i> a <i>British Grand Prix,

52:17.968 --> 52:20.266
I mean you couldn't put it in a book,
it was incredible.

52:20.346 --> 52:23.850
Clay, what is
so good about this Williams car?

52:23.932 --> 52:26.151
Everything, everything
flaughsL.

52:26.226 --> 52:28.979
It was the first win
for Frank Williams in Formula 1

52:29.021 --> 52:32.025
since he started
over a decade previously.

52:32.107 --> 52:34.826
Frank Williams,
this must be the happiest day

52:34.860 --> 52:36.487
of your motor racing life.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.447
No doubt about that,
you're right yes.

52:38.530 --> 52:39.758
Frank, what were your feelings

52:39.782 --> 52:41.204
during those last few laps?

52:41.283 --> 52:43.123
Well sheer terror
that the car wouldn't finish,

52:43.160 --> 52:47.006
we'd lost Alan and I was terrified of
losing Clay but the car was very sweet.

52:47.081 --> 52:48.892
Frank we've watched you struggling,

52:48.916 --> 52:51.840
<i>if I may say so,
in motor racing since 1969.</i>

52:51.919 --> 52:53.605
<i>Frank Williams,</i>
a <i>man who's kept trying for Britain,</i>

52:53.629 --> 52:56.553
many congratulations Frank,
thank you very much.

52:58.217 --> 52:59.639
I think my parents just,

52:59.718 --> 53:01.846
after everyone had gone,
just sat there,

53:01.929 --> 53:04.102
just on the sofa
of the caravan arm in arm

53:04.139 --> 53:07.484
and just didn't want the day to end,
it was, it was surreal.

53:07.559 --> 53:09.732
So what did that feel like?

53:09.812 --> 53:15.034
Well relief I suppose, a relief,
because a lot of people would think,

53:15.109 --> 53:19.660
oh Frank, bloody Frank hasn't got a clue
what he was doing but I pressed on.

53:19.738 --> 53:23.709
For me personally I felt,
about bloody time.

53:23.784 --> 53:25.957
<i>From that moment on in the season</i>

53:26.036 --> 53:27.356
<i>I think we were totally dominant,</i>

53:27.413 --> 53:31.964
<i>we were a second or two a lap quicker
than anybody else everywhere.</i>

53:32.042 --> 53:33.937
<i>I went on and won
the next three Grand Prix's,</i>

53:33.961 --> 53:36.180
<i>I won the Dutch Grand Prix,
the Austrian Grand Prix</i>

53:36.255 --> 53:37.848
<i>and the German Grand Prix.</i>

53:37.923 --> 53:41.097
<i>And Jones has done it,
and he is the world champion.</i>

53:48.016 --> 53:52.738
<i>He's the world champion of 1982,
Keke Rosberg.</i>

54:26.638 --> 54:29.733
Well he has an eye for the ladies,
Frank, he's always liked a pretty girl.

54:31.268 --> 54:35.865
<i>I, like Frank, had women
literally throwing themselves at me</i>

54:35.939 --> 54:38.783
and you can't help every now
and again pick one up can you?

54:38.859 --> 54:43.160
<i>I used to get notes put on
my windscreen wiper of my car,</i>

54:43.238 --> 54:44.958
<i>there were groupies
going around the circuit</i>

54:45.032 --> 54:47.034
and they were parading
up and down the pits,

54:47.117 --> 54:50.542
unreal, we called
them screwdrivers, and they did.

54:50.621 --> 54:54.922
With any sport you get
a following of glamorous women

54:55.000 --> 54:56.593
who are just there for the action

54:56.668 --> 54:59.296
and they will appear
at the parties in the evening,

54:59.379 --> 55:01.677
sometimes in the hospitality areas

55:01.757 --> 55:05.261
<i>and a lot of the sponsors
employ promotions girls,</i>

55:05.344 --> 55:08.473
<i>all tall and long legs
and very glamorous.</i>

55:09.848 --> 55:11.521
<i>Formula 1 is
a heady cocktail</i>

55:11.600 --> 55:14.695
<i>of strutting temperamental egos</i>

55:14.770 --> 55:18.070
<i>and a deep undercurrent
of male sexual domination.</i>

55:19.358 --> 55:20.280
<i>When I</i> started

55:20.359 --> 55:22.782
there were very
few women working in Formula 1,

55:22.820 --> 55:28.122
some of the teams had a female caterer,
maybe a husband and wife team,

55:28.200 --> 55:30.202
there were press officers
who were women,

55:31.411 --> 55:34.005
<i>women were considered
to be irrelevant, they made the tea,</i>

55:34.081 --> 55:37.881
<i>booked the flights or provided
glamorous accompaniment</i>

55:37.960 --> 55:39.428
<i>to drivers and team owners.</i>

56:04.528 --> 56:06.030
Although she was a perfectionist,

56:06.113 --> 56:09.663
she knew that life
is always full of compromises

56:09.700 --> 56:12.374
and that was probably one of
them and she'd fallen for Frank

56:12.452 --> 56:15.547
<i>but she'd fallen
for Frank as a complete package.</i>

56:15.581 --> 56:18.630
<i>And because she was completely
besotted and head over heels</i>

56:18.709 --> 56:22.589
that was it and she dealt with it.
Um I wouldn't.

56:38.020 --> 56:40.114
Could you imagine at that time,

56:40.188 --> 56:41.815
a woman being
Deputy Team Principal or-

56:41.899 --> 56:44.152
No, absolutely no way,

56:45.861 --> 56:49.206
women, men in motor racing are sexist,

56:49.281 --> 56:52.376
they're possibly
the most sexist people in any sport.

56:54.453 --> 56:56.581
<i>Women are always going
to come under more scrutiny</i>

56:56.663 --> 56:59.667
<i>because there was a huge body
of people within Formula 1</i>

56:59.750 --> 57:03.345
<i>who still don't believe
women can do the same job as men.</i>

57:09.801 --> 57:13.851
<i>I think Formula 1 traditionally
has been quite</i> a <i>male dominated sport</i>

57:13.931 --> 57:16.980
but there are so many more women now
that work um in our sport,

57:17.059 --> 57:18.870
and that's not just
in the high profile positions,

57:18.894 --> 57:21.397
so we've got female engineers,
female aerodynamicists

57:21.480 --> 57:23.949
so things are absolutely changing.

57:24.024 --> 57:27.153
So your father is an icon
when it comes to Formula 1,

57:27.235 --> 57:29.863
was it harder to prove your skills
because you're a woman

57:29.947 --> 57:31.915
or because he's your father?

57:31.990 --> 57:36.666
Um Formula 1, this role,
was not my ambition from a little girl,

57:36.745 --> 57:41.000
however kind of circumstances changed
and a job became available

57:41.083 --> 57:45.304
and I was asked to do it, not by my dad,
um and in fact when he was asked

57:45.379 --> 57:48.223
he said no way is she working
for my company.

57:48.298 --> 57:49.901
So if you're,
in your private life,

57:49.925 --> 57:54.180
in which situations do you enjoy
being a woman?

57:54.221 --> 57:55.221
Um...

57:57.391 --> 57:59.769
<i>I get asked
that female question</i> a <i>lot,</i>

57:59.851 --> 58:01.524
<i>I was asked it last night at dinner,</i>

58:01.603 --> 58:04.732
<i>I was asked it in
four interviews I did yesterday,</i>

58:04.815 --> 58:08.661
but I still find it quite odd
that people find it surprising

58:08.735 --> 58:11.989
that a girl might be doing this job,
it really kind of annoys me.

58:29.840 --> 58:33.219
Heritage is sort of a nice,
to-itself department uh...

58:33.260 --> 58:35.638
we, we have some support
from people in the factory

58:35.721 --> 58:39.066
but it's, it's mostly just,
just me and Dicky so

58:39.141 --> 58:41.940
yeah it's mostly just, just us here.

58:43.729 --> 58:47.154
Just getting down here to some of
the bigger components,

58:47.232 --> 58:48.376
you can see much heavier there,

58:48.400 --> 58:50.528
they're actually
buckling the shelves in here.

58:50.610 --> 58:53.079
Oh that box isn't numbered.

58:55.240 --> 58:57.459
Does Claire ever
come over here Johnny?

58:57.534 --> 59:00.788
No I don't think
she knows this room exists.

59:00.871 --> 59:01.793
- I don't.
- No?

59:01.872 --> 59:04.466
No, nobody comes over here
I don't think.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.095
Me and Johnny.

59:11.715 --> 59:16.186
Jonathan wearing his um, Johnny used
to like playing soldiers quite a lot.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.689
- How are things?
- Not, not the best.

59:21.266 --> 59:24.065
- Can you talk about that?
- Um...

59:27.689 --> 59:30.784
Um... Johnny is, you know it's um...

59:30.859 --> 59:35.160
I suppose some families just have,
you know, always gonna have

59:35.238 --> 59:39.038
you know some issues
aren't they and um

59:39.117 --> 59:45.124
unfortunately Johnny and I do
um, which I think is something that I will

59:45.207 --> 59:49.838
regret and be very unhappy
about my whole life um...

59:52.464 --> 59:55.559
And is that,
is that to do with work or...?

59:55.634 --> 59:59.559
Yeah. Yeah it is, unfortunately.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:05.478
Is it because
you got the position that you did and...

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.788
- Yeah.
- He didn't.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:09.281
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.905
Yeah I'm not, I'm not the oldest
and I'm not a boy.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.800
Uh... that's me and Claire.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.783
You two look
pretty close in that one.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:28.254
That was about 30 years ago
flaughsL.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:42.057
It's horrible,
he thinks that I was ambitious

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:47.521
and that um I put myself in,

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:51.323
in the position and
you know I lobbied, I,

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:55.448
you know cajoled my way in and

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:58.701
couldn't be the situation... could not
be further from the truth.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:05.125
It's something their mother
would be deeply unhappy about

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:09.208
and I think it's something
that she could've sorted

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:13.296
um in a way
that probably nobody else could.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.847
I don't believe Frank could,
could sort it out.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:52.467
<i>I can remember some time in
1984 and as young children do,</i>

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.753
<i>waking up earlier than their parents</i>

01:01:54.836 --> 01:02:00.309
and just for this man
with a moustache and uh...

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.095
an accent different to ours,
obviously being from Birmingham

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.727
just walking past
and saying good morning

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.649
and it scaring the living life out of us,

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.978
and us both running into
my parents' room

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.289
and saying there's a man in the house,
there's a man in the house

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.987
and uh... them saying,
“No, no, no, no it's Daddy's new driver,

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:16.942
"that's Nigel Mansell."

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:19.670
The rumours say
that you might be going to Williams,

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:20.796
what would you have to say about that?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.140
Williams? Williams?
Who are they?.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.710
<i>When Nigel was on top form</i>

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.721
<i>he was as good as any driver
we've ever had I would say,</i>

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.918
he was hard work out of the car

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.125
but in the car he was,
he was really superb.

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:36.712
<i>Nigel is three people in one,</i>

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:39.389
<i>he's an absolutely fantastic racing driver</i>

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:43.598
who is just astoundingly good
when it comes to overtaking people.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:46.806
<i>And Mansell moves to the
outside and Manselfs going through,</i>

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:51.109
<i>Nigel Mansell takes the lead
and neatly boxes Ayrton Senna.</i>

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.937
<i>As</i> a <i>family man,
he's just the nicest guy,</i>

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:58.571
<i>he's got a lovely family, he adores his
children, he's faithful to his wife,</i>

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.073
<i>unlike quite a few racing drivers</i>

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.531
but <i>as</i> a person out of the car
he's an absolute arse,

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.787
you know he's just
a difficult bloke to work with.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.511
Drive slower, get it together,

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.412
it's a fucking nightmare,
then someone's...

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:13.214
And that was why,
generally speaking,

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:18.012
we all liked Nelson quite a lot
and found Nigel a bit too much.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:31.688
Nelson Piquet replaced
Keke Rosberg for '86

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:36.397
<i>and he was hired because
Frank loved the idea of Nelson Piquet,</i>

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.028
<i>he had already won
two world championships</i>

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:42.702
<i>and he loved
Nelson's Brazilian flare, his girlfriends,</i>

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:44.547
<i>the way he looked,
the way he carried himself.</i>

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:47.415
<i>He had the private yacht
and he had</i> a <i>helicopter on the yacht</i>

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.539
and he had a
citation 10 jet which at that time

01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:54.213
was by far the fastest jet in the world
and he was flying it.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:04:00.012
<i>Nelson was ebullient, loved life
and was</i> a <i>very cool guy,</i>

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:04.637
<i>Nigel was cheese
and chutney sandwiches</i>

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.185
<i>and hot milk before he went to bed.</i>

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.261
Yes!

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:11.724
I thought at that time
Nelson was the best driver in the world,

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:16.027
<i>so I was thrilled to bits he was coming,
he was very keen to join Williams</i>

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.904
<i>because he felt that
we were the quickest.</i>

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:21.609
<i>Nelson felt
with that package around him</i>

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.820
<i>he could win
another world championship.</i>

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:39.634
We were doing
the last of the pre-season tests,

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:45.466
<i>"the Paul Ricard Circuit, so we had both
Nigel Manse" and Nelson Piquet there,</i>

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:48.267
<i>Frank had come out to the test because</i>

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.929
<i>he was very excited
about the performance.</i>

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:57.064
<i>Dad was you know away,
he was at a preseason test</i>

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.196
<i>and it was a kind of
spring afternoon and mum</i>

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.819
<i>suggested we go out on some bikes</i>

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:06.453
<i>and took a little picnic
and found a field, like you do</i>

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:09.657
<i>and it was a really lovely day
and then we just got back</i>

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:14.586
and waiting for dad to come home
and, but he never did.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.172
<i>The test was going very well,</i>

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.091
<i>I think Frank
was full of the joys of spring</i>

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.715
<i>and thinking, right we're gonna go out
and show them</i>

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:24.637
<i>we can win the world championship,</i>

01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:30.685
<i>he was due to run a half marathon
on the Sunday morning afterwards.</i>

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.390
<i>Frank, keen to get back
for the half marathon he was doing,</i>

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:37.225
it was a county half marathon,
he was that good.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.495
<i>And so he and Peter Windsor</i>

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:42.944
<i>who was the marketing guy at the time,
they went to the airport.</i>

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:46.952
<i>And he had his Avis Ford Sierra...</i>

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.462
<i>and he said “Right c'mon, let's go.”</i>

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:53.663
And then a spot of get-home,
have you ever heard of get-home-itis?

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.053
When you wanna just get home?

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:59.331
You've gotta get home, must do,
must catch the last flight.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:03.510
<i>He took</i> a <i>little twiddly road
down through the back of the circuit</i>

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:07.886
<i>and it was a very, very twisty,
narrow road.</i>

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:11.309
<i>And he was in this 1600 Sierra,
throwing the thing around,</i>

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.057
braking as late as he could

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:15.016
but I do remember
saying to Frank at one moment,

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:19.442
when the back end skipped out
under braking into a tight left hander,

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.736
<i>uh... “Are the brakes ok
on this thing Frank?”</i>

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.905
And he said
with sort of trepidation,

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.483
“Frank do you always drive like this?",

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:29.003
meaning, and you can't really
tell your boss this, f-ing well slow down.

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:29.869
<i>I remember him saying,</i>

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:31.664
<i>“Yeah, the brakes are fine,
brakes are fine.</i>

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.299
<i>I was rushing
and rushing and rushing.</i>

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.550
<i>Suddenly we were in clear road,</i>

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:35.826
<i>the road was downhill</i>

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:39.334
<i>and there was a fast left hand kink
about 300 yards ahead of us</i>

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:42.507
and I remember seeing
through the windscreen the,

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.295
a stone wall on the inside,
it looked like we were just gonna hit the,

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:50.803
<i>the end of this wall and my reaction was
just to bury myself in the foot well area.</i>

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:55.433
As we hit the back,
that wall the car went up in the air...

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:02.860
<i>there was just silence,
just a terrible silence,</i>

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:06.782
then this massive thump and crash.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:10.827
It was you know a real whack
in my neck sharp, sharp pain, pain.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.534
It's, rolling over doesn't hurt like this.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:17.117
I remember Frank saying
after about 10 seconds,

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.326
“Are you ok? Are you ok?

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:19.969
I can't move, I'm trapped, I'm trapped,

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:22.622
get me out, get the ignition off,
get the ignition off',

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.423
because already
there was a smell of fuel.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:30.051
I'm suspended about three,
four inches from the floor upside down.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:30.925
<i>And there was</i> a <i>lot of blood</i>

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:32.725
<i>because he'd taken
a direct blow on his head</i>

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.759
<i>when the roof had come down like that.</i>

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:36.820
<i>Soon as I undid the belt,
of course I fell on my bleeding head,</i>

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.061
<i>right on my neck again.</i>

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:43.818
<i>The only thing I could remember</i>

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.941
<i>was to try to stabilise
his head and neck</i>

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:50.321
and try to pull him out
by holding him under the armpits

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.324
and then he started to say,
“You know Peter, I'm a Roman Catholic

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:57.499
<i>and if anything happens, I want to see
if you can get the last rites.”</i>

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.636
<i>We were just looking at packing up</i>

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.381
when a French youth
arrived on a moped asking for me

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:06.924
and he explained that
Frank Williams had gone off the road

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.719
<i>and wanted some help.</i>

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:12.513
<i>But Nelson said “Oh shit,
that's a twisty road, I know the road,</i>

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.512
"let's go down and see."

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:19.768
We didn't know exactly the damage
but uh...

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:24.352
Uh... we knew it was
something very dramatic.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.984
<i>We raced to the scene
as quickly as we could</i>

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:32.567
and at that time Frank's life
was in the balance.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:37.238
<i>And that's when Nigel
delegated himself really</i>

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.290
<i>to go in the ambulance with Frank,</i>

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.537
<i>basically hold Frank's hand
and be with him.</i>

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:46.582
Uh... I had a tremendous fear
for Frank's safety and,

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.841
and his wellbeing and life at that time.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:54.798
So certain people needed to be energised
to do the right thing, quickly.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.361
<i>But by then it was pretty clear</i>

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.979
<i>that there was a very good chance
that he's broken his neck.</i>

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:07.812
When I phoned Patrick Head I told him
that it looks like, from the x-rays,

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:10.067
that Frank's spinal column's been cut

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:14.904
and it was pretty, I think I said to him,
“I think he's' fucked”,

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:19.573
like you know he looked really bad.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:25.537
<i>The next day Ginny
and I flew down to Marseille</i>

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:30.091
and she was pretty shattered
but she was a brave woman.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:56.444
The first time that I knew
that things were gonna be really serious

01:09:56.526 --> 01:10:00.121
<i>was when the doctor in charge
of the intensive care unit</i>

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.575
<i>called Ginny and I into
his office and said,</i>

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.831
"“When do you wanna move
Frank back to England?"

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.881
Which I immediately
took to mean they think he's gonna die

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.876
and they don't want him
to die in their hospital.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:38.193
At that stage,
when Ginny got the message

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:40.199
that the frogs
were gonna let Frank die,

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:44.124
<i>she organised a plane,
flew him back to Heathrow,</i>

01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:46.621
<i>an ambulance took him
to the London hospital</i>

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:50.001
and 20 minutes later he was
hooked up to English machines

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.673
and he was in
a shocking state, shocking state.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.728
<i>The first thing
that happened to Frank</i>

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.426
<i>was that he had a tracheotomy operation
in the London hospital</i>

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:00.306
and the operation went
well in the sense that

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:03.513
suddenly Frank had
relief and he could breathe,

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.971
he could get the fluid out of his lungs

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:11.059
and I remember Ginny learnt how
to operate the extraction of the fluid

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.786
and would help the nurses
and was able to do that

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.858
on her own within a day or two.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:19.534
Her approach was I'm gonna manage
these nurses around Frank's bed here

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.828
the way Frank runs a race team.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:38.341
Ginny was literally his guardian,

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.797
<i>he clinically died three times</i>

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.852
<i>and without Ginny jumping on top of him
and pumping his lungs out</i>

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:49.522
and resuscitating him,
not the nurses and the doctors,

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:52.942
but Ginny herself,
um he would've been dead.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:58.948
<i>I remember I was off one day
and Ginny was on duty as she called it.</i>

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:01.242
The head of the unit came out and said,

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:04.366
“Normally Mrs Williams,
in this situation,

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:08.746
"we would turn the life support off,
but we need the family's permission."

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:37.563
Did you ever doubt whether
Frank should be kept alive?

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.613
Yeah.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.693
Yeah and um I actually said to him,

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:46.325
“Frank, I'm your best pal
and I'd do anything for ya,

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:48.498
you want a bag over your head,
I'll do it for you",

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.450
I promise you I said this,

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.286
I said “but you'd have
to convince me first

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:57.169
"why your kids wouldn't
want you around in any condition"

01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.047
and I said,
“So don't ask me to do anything

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.879
"that your kids wouldn't approve of."

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.231
So he said, “I won't do that David",

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:07.304
that was when he was speaking,
he said “I'll never do that."

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:13.439
So this is a book
I wrote when I was little.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.786
I wrote that
“I thought it would be a good idea

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.938
to start a kind of scrap book
all about my father.

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:22.945
Above all I wanted somewhere
to write down all my memories of him

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.573
before my mind had
the chance to forget them.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:28.780
Hopefully I will never forget what
he used to be like before his accident.

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:34.911
Everyone thinks their father is the best.
I'm not an exception.

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:38.294
"I worship my father.
It sounds silly but he's my hero."

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:42.168
<i>I started taking CDs</i>

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.604
<i>and things like that
for him to listen to,</i>

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.551
<i>to fill in the time a bit,</i>

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.733
<i>because you have to remember
he was a marathon runner,</i>

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:52.558
<i>you know he used to run 12 miles
every day and felt bad if he didn't</i>

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:55.811
<i>and it was a spectacularly
big change of life for Frank</i>

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:57.312
<i>when he had his accident.</i>

01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:00.315
So what, what kind
of music did you introduce him to?

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:01.737
Bach.

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:07.990
♪ Erbarme dich ♪
♪ Johann Sebastian Bach ♪

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:14.041
<i>I mean I thought
that my pal Frank was indestructible,</i>

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.834
<i>you know he got away with everything,</i>

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.959
<i>Frank'll be alright
but he wasn't on this one</i>

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:21.757
<i>and Pd go and see him
three or four times a week,</i>

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:23.709
<i>I always gave him a kiss, I had to,</i>

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.270
<i>lean over and give him a kiss
on the forehead</i>

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.688
and say
"Your old mate Brode's here, mate."

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:30.137
and he used to flicker his eyelids
at that, he couldn't speak,

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:33.641
stuff in his mouth, up his nose,
oh it was a horrible sight.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:36.990
<i>Oh there was</i>
a <i>lot of discomfort</i>

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:38.482
<i>and pain in the very early days,</i>

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:42.027
that's inevitable,
when such a major part of your body

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:47.784
gets a kick in the arse
but um I can't say "Oh it was terrible",

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:49.952
it's not in my mind,
I don't remember much of it.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:54.373
Body's got a great
many ways of protecting itself,

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:57.167
when it's in a bit of pain or bother.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:06.878
First thing they said,
“Broken your neck, long recovery period,

01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:09.510
how much you'll recover isn't sure“,

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:12.057
of course they knew
I wouldn't recover uh...

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:13.851
but you don't quite tell a person

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.554
"when he wakes up
“You're f-ed mate, for good."

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.108
<i>Probably for the first time
in front of me,</i>

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:25.484
<i>Virginia, she lost it,
it was a sort of an awful moment</i>

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:29.409
and I remember putting my arms
around her and she was saying.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:30.963
“Frank's gonna be, he's quadriplegic,

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.621
"he can't walk Jamie,
he can't do anything."

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.915
<i>And I was saying, “It's gonna be ok”</i>

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.537
<i>but I had this sort of feeling,</i>

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:40.039
I wasn't sure at all that
it was going to be ok.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:46.092
For a long time, maybe three,
four months after the accident,

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:50.968
there was no real certainty that
he'd ever be able to leave the hospital

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:55.848
and to all intents
and purposes he was dead to the team.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:58.270
And you know there we were
with the fastest car,

01:15:58.345 --> 01:15:59.813
we were gonna win all the races,

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.563
we got two fantastic drivers
and everything was going

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:06.441
and then all of a sudden the boss,
the figure head, the main man

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.902
had had this horrific accident
and it really was a massive change.

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:19.284
I think then it sort of dawned on us all,
um, where do we go from here?

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:21.039
What's gonna happen in '86?

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:27.642
We await the <i>start of</i> the.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:31.216
<i>Brazilian Grand Prix
and the 1986 season.</i>

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:35.300
<i>Sadly, Frank Williams,
boss of the Williams team isn't here</i>

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:38.220
<i>after a major road accident in France.</i>

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:43.141
<i>But for the whole team,
that's an added incentive to do well.</i>

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:45.202
Well they went to work
with a vengeance,

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.274
instead of them all
moping about, they said.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:49.372
“You tell Frank you don't have to
worry about a thing here,

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.239
we're gonna win the
next races for him.“

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:55.535
And it's go.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:17:00.287
<i>A superb start for Nigel Mansell,
who has already passed Nelson Piquet.</i>

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:07.836
<i>And it's Senna, Manse“, Piquet is
the running order at the present moment.</i>

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:11.215
<i>Manselfs touching wheels
with Ayrton Senna.</i>

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:14.422
<i>We went to the first race
and Nigel crashed on the first lap</i>

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:18.885
<i>whilst trying to overtake Senna
in a very stupid manoeuvre.</i>

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.654
Mansell appears
to <i>be</i> out of the race

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:25.479
<i>so up into second position ifs now
Piquet and Moretto is up into third place.</i>

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:28.778
<i>And through
into the lead goes Nelson Piquet,</i>

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:35.907
<i>Nelson Piquet leads on lap three,
this one is for you Frank.</i>

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:40.912
<i>Nelson Piquet wins
the 1986 Brazilian Grand Prix</i>

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.789
<i>and you will hear
the crowd go absolutely mad.</i>

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.296
I can say
it was a very special day for me,

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:49.294
I think it's a good present for Frank,

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:52.172
I think he's there
lying in a bed and uh...

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:55.801
I think he will
be happy to watch the race and uh...

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.305
Uh... we hope uh...
that god help Frank also.

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.269
It was clear we had the best car

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.392
<i>and the only thing that
was gonna come between us</i>

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:06.189
<i>and winning the championship</i>

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:10.020
<i>was lots of intra team rivalry
between Nelson and Nigel.</i>

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:13.439
I think that, that was used
actually to motivate Frank,

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.275
we need you Frank,
to manage these two guys,

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:20.033
because there's gonna be problems if,
if we just let them race free rein

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:21.992
and we need
to get on top of this quite quickly.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.163
<i>Nelson claimed
that Frank had said</i>

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:26.960
<i>you will be number one driver,</i>

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:31.633
you will always have the spare car
and the team will revolve around you.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:35.678
I came there to win the championship,
I came there as the number one driver.

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:38.848
<i>Problem was, Nigel didn't sign
as</i> a <i>number two driver.</i>

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.766
<i>So he drove as fast as he could</i>

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:43.594
and quite a lot of the time
that was faster than Nelson was going.

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.113
<i>Nigel used
to drive straight at him,</i>

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:46.573
<i>because Nigel was pretty aggressive,</i>

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:48.645
I mean a couple of times
Nelson said to me

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.601
I had two choices, be second or die.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.943
I must've been a nightmare
to drive with <i>as</i> a number two,

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.778
being as quick as I was at times.

01:18:56.857 --> 01:19:00.907
I mean that was horrendous.
You know, they hated each other.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:06.038
<i>Nelson insisted that we went
into the hospital and saw a,</i>

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:09.165
<i>an almost dead, croaking Frank.</i>

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:11.748
Saying, “Frank you said
that this and whatever

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:17.052
and Patrick is running the team so
that we're equal number ones with Nigel.

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:18.767
"And that's what,
not what you said to me."

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:21.340
And Frank was, I mean I don't think
Frank could reply to him.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.266
He was almost out of it.

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:28.310
When things didn't go
<i>as</i> well as they should've for Nelson,

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:30.391
in other words
when Nigel was quicker,

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:34.695
Nelson assumed that
it could only be because

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.398
Nigel Mansell had
been given preferential treatment.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:40.951
100% the English team
wanna win the English driver,

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:45.031
<i>Williams for sure wanted to make
an English champion, not me.</i>

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:46.957
Nelson thinks that there was

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:50.502
a bias towards Nigel
because he was British.

01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:53.376
I think that's not true, um

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:56.129
there could've been but Nigel
was such an arse

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.436
that it was very difficult
to have a natural bias to him,

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.259
I mean on one occasion, I do remember
he was whinging about something,

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:03.887
“Oh did you see what he did
to me then?", on the radio,

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:09.268
<i>and Patrick said, on the radio,
“For fuck's sake, stop whinging Nigel”</i>

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:11.565
<i>and switched his radio off.</i>

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.895
<i>Patrick carried the business
in my absence, it was very hard on him.</i>

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:18.026
Paddy was left lumbered,

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:21.450
an enormous amount of responsibility,
he wasn't ready for.

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:25.075
<i>I was up to my eyebrows with two guys</i>

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:28.374
<i>that both were determined to be
world champion that year</i>

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.793
<i>and were not gonna take
for me saying.</i>

01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:33.166
"Sorry I can't make a decent job
of running your car"

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:36.419
because I'm too worried
about Frank Williams so uh...

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:42.551
<i>It was a very stressful,
very difficult time in the team.</i>

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:45.883
<i>And</i> uh... <i>everything went
completely disaster for me,</i>

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:47.764
<i>but uh... Frank was not there</i>

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.595
<i>and I couldn't come
to the hospital and say</i>

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:54.400
“Frank, this has happened this,
this has happened that, it's not fair“,

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:57.820
his problem was much more
than my problem.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.623
<i>Frank was still in intensive care</i>

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:13.328
and he remained in intensive care
for quite a time and it was another,

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:17.631
I think it was 12 weeks
um before he eventually came home

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.755
but they were the longest weeks
you could imagine.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:34.686
<i>We all were just relieved
and thrilled that dad made it</i>

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:36.563
<i>and he was home
and we got him home.</i>

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:40.063
<i>Yes it was a very different kind of life</i>

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:43.615
<i>but we had dad still
and we were a family still</i>

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:46.739
and he still had Formula 1
and that's what kept him going.

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:50.743
<i>Frank Williams is quadriplegic,</i>

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:51.907
<i>from his shoulders down</i>

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:54.584
<i>he has no control
over the functions of his own body.</i>

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:58.126
<i>Less than six months
after the accident</i>

01:21:58.205 --> 01:22:00.378
<i>he had ruthlessly
forced enough movement</i>

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:04.712
<i>into his partly functioning shoulders
to push himself along,</i>

01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:08.720
<i>but his arms are just pistons of
flesh and bones, with no feeling.</i>

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:13.346
He's paralysed from
his shoulders literally downwards,

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:16.228
he can lift his arms
and he can, for example,

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:17.786
if he wants
to scratch him in his face

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:21.946
he pushes his hands
against his face um

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.022
but he can't, he can't use his fingers.

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:42.976
Why does it say
hell on wheels?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Um...

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:49.969
Um it's because Dad's life
is hell in a wheelchair.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.529
He's always in
a lot of pain all the time,

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:56.226
I don't think people realise that,

01:22:56.305 --> 01:23:00.276
how much pain Frank is in, every day
of his life, every minute of every day.

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:03.163
You wouldn't know
it though would you?

01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:07.067
No you wouldn't think he has anything
to complain about.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.698
Dad never does think he has anything to
complain about.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:14.874
That's a lovely picture of mum and,
well not so good of dad, lovely of mum.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:19.499
And what about Ginny,
how did Ginny react?

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:22.252
Well it was tough, tough, very tough
I think. Very tough lady.

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:26.131
Um but she didn't fall apart,
she took very good care of me.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:28.838
<i>It must've been very hard for her,</i>

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.923
<i>suddenly you're not
a proper husband anymore</i>

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.966
<i>and have to spend a lot of time
looking after him.</i>

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:37.896
It's very difficult for anyone
who hasn't lived with a quadriplegic,

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:42.067
to know what it's like to almost lose
your husband but not quite.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:09.254
<i>Well their relationship clearly
was likely to change</i>

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:14.888
<i>um in that Frank needed care
at all times of the day and night</i>

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:18.562
so if it was
a different kind of life for, for Frank

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:22.687
it was gonna be an equally different
kind of life for, for Virginia.

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:30.737
'l'm not usually given
to making New Year's resolutions,

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:34.366
but at the end of 1988 I decided that
I would spend the following year

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:36.867
setting down everything
that has happened to Frank and me

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:38.369
in the last two decades.

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:40.542
Both before and after the car accident,

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:43.746
which left him permanently paralysed
from the neck down.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:45.627
I felt it might act as an exorcism.

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:48.710
A way to put it all behind me
and start to look forward again.'

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:52.355
Reading it, it was like, Jesus Christ,
she went through this

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:54.131
and she didn't tell anyone,

01:24:54.214 --> 01:24:56.512
you know she didn't share
that burden with anybody.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.229
Why do you think
she shared it, then?

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:03.399
<i>She says that it was</i>
a <i>cathartic exercise for her,</i>

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.350
<i>because Dad's the star isn't he?</i>

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:06.731
<i>Dad's the one in the spotlight,</i>

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.984
<i>Dad's the one that everyone goes
Frank Williams is amazing,</i>

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:11.940
<i>Frank Williams is wonderful</i>

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:14.326
<i>and for all those years
Mum had been in the background,</i>

01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:16.449
<i>I don't think she did it,
she didn't wanna do it</i>

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.155
<i>because she wanted fame or adulation,</i>

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:22.493
she just did it because she wanted to,
people to know the full story.

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:27.168
'His memory of the early days
after his accident is blurred and vague,

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:29.466
he has never asked me
what it was like in France

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:31.217
or in the London hospital

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:35.639
or what it has been like for me
these past few years, now he will know.'

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:40.769
Have you,
have you read her book?

01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:42.266
No, I don't want to.

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:43.865
Why do you not want to read it?

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.687
That's a peculiar emotion.

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.775
I think, I would like him to read it,

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:54.154
um because I think that
it would be respectful to Mum

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:57.361
um to understand
what she did go through but I just,

01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:01.540
you know I think,

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:05.210
I dunno I just think it's probably
too much for Dad to read it,

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:08.255
he doesn't feel any need to,
but I wish he would.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:13.093
Do you think you
ever will read it?

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.889
Maybe, before I die, but not,
not imminently that's for sure.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:20.850
That picture must be.

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:23.395
Frank's first Grand Prix
after his accident,

01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:26.932
big change of life for all of us.

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:47.788
<i>When Frank appeared in the
wheelchair the crowd just went crazy.</i>

01:26:48.829 --> 01:26:50.098
It's great fun to be with the team,

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:51.802
it's great fun to be
at a race track again.

01:26:54.334 --> 01:26:55.436
<i>Back at the track,</i>

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.383
<i>Frank Williams savoured
his team's success</i>

01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.048
<i>for the first time this season,</i>

01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:03.136
<i>Piquet and Mansell took first
and third places in practice.</i>

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:06.563
<i>He did have</i>
a <i>really sort of symbolic visit</i>

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:08.356
<i>but he was determined to be there</i>

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:12.107
<i>because he wanted
the world of Formula 1</i>

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:17.487
<i>to know that he was still around
and ostensibly still in control</i>

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:24.120
but he played no part at all and
was very much a show appearance.

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:29.248
<i>But my father only attended
on the Friday, the practice day</i>

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:32.080
<i>and that was all
he was physically up for.</i>

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:36.585
The <i>lights</i> for red and go!

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:42.307
<i>And Piquet leads,
Mansell is second into clearways...</i>

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:47.479
<i>The two Williams cars
in their battle for leadership,</i>

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:51.900
<i>toe-to-toe, eyeball to eyeball,
almost wheel to wheel.</i>

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.607
<i>Nelson and Nigel</i>

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:57.610
<i>really, really started
to slug it out with one another.</i>

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:01.068
<i>Nigel wasn't afraid to be half an inch,
an inch away from anybody</i>

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.074
<i>if he had to be, erm, and he was</i>

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:08.284
<i>and it was serious motor racing between
the two Williams Honda drivers.</i>

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:10.084
And there he goes,

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.414
<i>Nigel Mansell
leads the British Grand Prix</i>

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:17.252
<i>from the man
who is his greatest competition.</i>

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:20.213
<i>Piquet's going for it as they go down
into the right hander</i>

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:23.640
<i>at Paddock and Mansell's
absolutely on the racing line,</i>

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:26.093
<i>there are no orders between these two.</i>

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:28.929
<i>From the pit wall,
that was the first time I remember</i>

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:32.858
not actually enjoying the race
because I was so sweaty palmed

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:35.277
as to what might happen
between the two of them

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:39.447
and I think Frank
was back home watching it on TV,

01:28:39.523 --> 01:28:43.619
probably <i>as</i> nervous as the rest of
the team was <i>at</i> that point.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:44.837
<i>Piquet going through on the inside</i>

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:45.862
<i>but he's gonna be blocked</i>

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:49.450
<i>"and he has been
and Manse" holds the lead. Great stuff.</i>

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:54.663
<i>Nigel Mansell exits the last corner,</i>

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:58.376
<i>"crosses the line
and Manse" is the winner.</i>

01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:01.462
<i>Great stuff. Wonderful drive.</i>

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:07.927
<i>Nigel has broken his back,
he's broken his neck,</i>

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:11.513
<i>he is now number one
in the world championship</i>

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:13.690
<i>and just listen to the crowd.</i>

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:24.451
<i>After the race it wasn't normal</i>

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:28.247
<i>for a team manager
or team representative</i>

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:31.416
to be on the podium,
but on this occasion,

01:29:31.491 --> 01:29:36.167
because Frank had been there
for the test and because it was Nigel

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:40.592
<i>and because it was Brands Hatch,
Ginny was invited up,</i>

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:45.343
<i>to take the Constructor's Trophy
on behalf of Frank.</i>

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.259
Now <i>behind</i> Alain <i>Prost,</i>

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.394
<i>the woman is Ginny Williams.</i>

01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:52.108
<i>You'll just see her in</i> a <i>minute I expect.</i>

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:55.562
<i>There's Ginny Williams and,
and Patrick Head,</i>

01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:01.113
<i>the designer of the
winning Williams car. Oh what a day.</i>

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:04.566
<i>And there
is Ginny holding up the trophy.</i>

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.714
<i>To me, that photograph is one
of my favourite photographs of Ginny</i>

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:13.618
because she's got this expression
on her face where it's just like, yes!

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:18.288
<i>It was</i> a <i>tremendous moment</i>

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:20.465
because of what
Ginny had gone through,

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.759
because the accident
just didn't happen to Frank,

01:30:22.834 --> 01:30:24.381
it happened to everybody

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:27.214
but the closest person it happened to
was his dear wife.

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:43.437
Hi Preston.

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:54.791
How we doing
there Jimmy Jock the Noo?

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:55.927
Alright thanks Frank.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:59.956
Is Biggles under control is he?
Very hard work isn't it?

01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:08.554
And the best therapy
Frank ever had

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:12.635
was being back at his desk with a phone
that Nelson gave him actually,

01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:15.766
which allowed him to
tap numbers on, big numbers on a pad

01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:18.644
<i>and he had a headset on,
make his own phone calls.</i>

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:22.519
<i>Mentally he said,</i>

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:25.981
“So <i>long as I'm on the phone, so long as
I can talk, I'm going motor racing.”</i>

01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:34.619
Basil Hill Road

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:49.346
Mentally, how do you think
the disability has affected Frank?

01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:51.232
I did ask, ask him a couple of times

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:53.099
when we,
when we are alone in the car if,

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:57.850
if he sometimes thinks of running again
and stuff like that

01:31:57.929 --> 01:32:00.808
but he said he gave
that thought up completely now,

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:03.939
<i>he is completely in peace
with the situation</i>

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.746
<i>and I think this is also
what you get from him,</i>

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:09.240
<i>he's not sitting there and thinks
"Oh shit I should have, I should have,</i>

01:32:09.315 --> 01:32:10.532
<i>just got on with it."</i>

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:14.279
<i>I can truthfully,
and I'm not bragging,</i>

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.673
I had a major business on my mind,

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:18.325
a racing team,
it's like having a hard-on all your life?

01:32:18.408 --> 01:32:19.885
It's like having
a hard-on all your life?

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:21.752
Aren't you jealous of what I do?

01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:24.206
Running a Grand Prix team,
owning a Grand Prix team,

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:27.964
I run racing cars
and world famous drivers all of the time,

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:29.920
it's, I think it's a great privilege.

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:38.094
You know
it's Jamie's birthday today dad?

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:43.256
Dad you need to choose
which cards you want to give him.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.196
Is he about 28?

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:50.694
He's about 32
actually, dad now, yeah.

01:32:54.694 --> 01:32:56.788
That's my signature..

01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:58.615
It's a bit drunkard but...

01:33:01.159 --> 01:33:06.131
Jamie, you write that, Jamie.

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:09.210
So dad always gives us money
for birthdays, all the time.

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:10.589
Am I giving some money.

01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:12.396
You're giving him money,
I've organised it.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.856
- Oh.
- So dad had his way,

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.133
because he has no idea how,
the value of money anymore,

01:33:16.216 --> 01:33:19.390
because he hasn't been
into a shop for about 45 years,

01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:22.643
he would give us all 50p
<i>so</i> we have to do it for him.

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:24.565
That, Claire,
that's absolutely untrue.

01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:27.328
It is true, but you don't really know
what things cost anymore do you?

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:28.194
Not really no.

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:31.523
So how much does
a newspaper cost?

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.779
Um up to 15 pence.

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:36.281
15 pence?

01:33:54.212 --> 01:33:55.964
<i>I personally just wanted to say,</i>

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:59.472
along with, I know my dad,
just thank you so much for all

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:01.724
the work that you've done
so far this year.

01:34:01.803 --> 01:34:05.023
I know it's been a really, really
long season for everybody.

01:34:05.098 --> 01:34:07.100
I know maybe there's
a little bit of disappointment

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:08.983
that we weren't
a little bit better this year,

01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:12.613
but I think everybody needs
to really remember where we came from,

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:15.613
and it's only been two years since
we were ninth in the championship.

01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:22.883
<i>When Williams were third</i>

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:24.534
<i>in the championship in Abu Dhabi</i>

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:27.336
I went into the garage
at the end of the race

01:34:27.412 --> 01:34:28.664
and I stood at the back

01:34:28.746 --> 01:34:31.374
until all the TV cameras
had finished with Claire

01:34:31.457 --> 01:34:34.131
and I said I think mum's in here

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:37.214
and she's watching over you
and <i>she's</i> thrilled.

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:41.054
I was just saying to dad,

01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:43.011
it feels like forever
since she's been gone,

01:34:44.721 --> 01:34:46.949
I think Mum would've been
a brilliant Team Principal you know,

01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:51.570
I think she would've been probably the
best Team Principal.

01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:53.612
Formula 1 had ever seen
if you'd just let her,

01:34:55.315 --> 01:34:57.989
I think secretly she
would've quite liked to have been TP.

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:21.718
Virginia was diagnosed
with cancer in the summer of 2010,

01:35:22.842 --> 01:35:25.436
I think she knew in her
heart of hearts that

01:35:25.511 --> 01:35:28.481
it was gonna get her and it
was just a question of when.

01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:34.279
<i>She was sort of taken
for granted in as much as you know</i>

01:35:34.354 --> 01:35:37.324
she was hail, hearty and fit
and well, and Frank wasn't

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:39.241
<i>so</i> it was not in anyone's mind I guess

01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:43.447
that she was as vulnerable
as she obviously was.

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:48.414
<i>I miss her,
she was</i> a <i>lovely lady</i>

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:53.086
<i>and I don't know how Frank copes
without her because</i>

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:55.604
he doesn't have a lot of people
to go home to talk to anymore,

01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:58.003
it's quite sad really.

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:04.514
<i>I think it affected him
very deeply um,</i>

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:07.436
more deeply possibly
than he would've imagined

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:13.019
and I think that he probably came
after her death to realise

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:14.899
just how much he loved her.

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:17.747
She was the foundation of.

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:19.441
<i>Frank's life outside motor racing,</i>

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:22.824
it was the only thing
you know and uh... he did say,

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.864
“I'm not bothering to go home anymore",
now Ginny's gone.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.627
He'd just sleep
in his flat in the factory,

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:30.206
he didn't bother to go home,
why bother'?

01:36:33.162 --> 01:36:35.836
I, I kip down the corridor
most nights of the week.

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:40.006
Um...

01:36:40.086 --> 01:36:41.397
Down the corridor
in the factory?

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:42.421
Yeah.

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:00.916
- How are you?
- Good actually.

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.692
Good.

01:37:02.775 --> 01:37:06.075
It's lovely and warm in here for you Dad.
I turned the heating up.

01:37:10.616 --> 01:37:12.136
You haven't read
the book, have you, pops?

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.413
No, I must make
the effort, so, yeah.

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:17.795
You should, you should make
the effort, it's an amazing book.

01:37:17.874 --> 01:37:20.468
- So you must read it.
- Yeah I will, yeah ok.

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:24.631
You should do,
although it is quite sad, it is quite sad.

01:37:26.966 --> 01:37:30.345
'Sometimes I dream that Frank
is running through the Berkshire lanes.

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:31.429
Everything is alright.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:36.401
Early in the morning in that split second
between sleeping and waking

01:37:36.476 --> 01:37:39.480
I sometimes forget,
as one might forget what day it is,

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:41.439
that Frank is paralysed

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.071
then the knife blade of
reality twists sharply in my stomach,

01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:45.743
jerking me back to the present,

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:49.322
how must Frank feel in that
same moment of semi-consciousness?

01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:52.375
What a nightmare to wake up to,
to be a prisoner within your own body,

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:55.374
not even to be able to get out of bed
until someone else moves you.

01:37:56.913 --> 01:37:58.290
Frank also dreams,

01:37:58.373 --> 01:38:00.671
he says that usually in his
dreams too he is running,

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.878
he has made a magical recovery

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.930
and everyone is astonished
to see him return to fitness

01:38:06.005 --> 01:38:08.133
and turns to watch
as he races past them.'

01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:12.596
'We are and always have been two
quite different characters,

01:38:12.678 --> 01:38:15.352
Frank has never wasted
his time bemoaning the past,

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:19.353
it's one of his many strengths, the
past means nothing to him,

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:21.984
whether it's a
world championship won or lost,

01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:23.989
or a road
accident that crippled him,

01:38:24.065 --> 01:38:27.410
it's yesterday, it's boring,
today and tomorrow are what count.

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:29.988
I in contrast am happiest with the past,

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:33.416
I prefer the past to the future
that frightens me now.

01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:36.210
What happened to my dreams?
I wanted us to grow old together,

01:38:36.285 --> 01:38:40.290
I wanted to die in Frank's arms,
I'm gonna start crying.

01:38:48.131 --> 01:38:50.475
'We have both grown
as a result of the experience,

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:53.099
but if a fairy godmother offered to
wave her magic wand

01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:56.602
and take us back to the way things
were when I first married Frank,

01:38:56.681 --> 01:39:01.061
I would not hesitate for a second,
I would happily exchange the houses,

01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:04.481
the executive jets,
the smart hotel rooms, the gold Rolexes

01:39:04.564 --> 01:39:07.283
forjust one night in a scruffy bedroom
anywhere in the world

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:13.081
with a selfish, funny, unsympathetic,
unreliable, charismatic man I married.

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:21.457
I laugh much more than I used to,
it helps to stop me crying.'

01:39:21.539 --> 01:39:23.507
Mm.

01:39:23.541 --> 01:39:25.541
- It's so sad.
- Don't start crying.

01:39:26.252 --> 01:39:27.344
Mm.

01:39:31.883 --> 01:39:33.851
I haven't read it since mum died

01:39:33.926 --> 01:39:36.896
and it's about how she will go
to her grave heart broken

01:39:36.971 --> 01:39:38.769
over what happened to you.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.772
You should be very proud.

01:40:37.615 --> 01:40:39.413
What about going to the races?

01:40:39.492 --> 01:40:42.621
Do you think you'll still be able
to go to the Grand Prix's this year?

01:40:43.829 --> 01:40:44.830
Why not?

01:40:46.332 --> 01:40:47.852
I dunno, doctor's orders?

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.129
I'm fine.

01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:54.056
I mean I'm paralysed but I'm,
I probably, I spend,

01:40:54.131 --> 01:40:55.234
I haven't had a day off work,

01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:56.401
I don't think
I've had a day off work in years,

01:40:56.425 --> 01:40:58.974
I just don't get ill, never have done.

01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:03.158
<i>Frank's personality hasn't changed,</i>

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:05.150
<i>what he can physically do has,</i>

01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:08.355
but his approach to his racing,
his love of Formula 1,

01:41:08.437 --> 01:41:10.940
his obsession with it
is just the same now,

01:41:11.023 --> 01:41:12.650
<i>as</i> it <i>has</i> been as long
as I've known him.

01:41:16.028 --> 01:41:17.948
So how does
a man like that retire?

01:41:18.447 --> 01:41:19.633
He's not <i>going</i> to retire,

01:41:19.657 --> 01:41:20.817
<i>he's going to die on the job.</i>

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.208
<i>Well Frank will never stop.</i>

01:41:25.288 --> 01:41:27.382
<i>Yeah he will stop
when he closes his eyes.</i>

01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:09.835
<i>Do you think you'll</i> see
<i>Williams on top again,</i>

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.910
in your lifetime?

01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:21.672
Yes, certainly possible.
