01:47.149 --> 01:50.736
The general talked about
killing the president.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.155
That, along with Conway's outburst
on the plane--

01:53.238 --> 01:56.825
-That sounds worse than it was.
-No, that sounds exactly as bad as it was.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.576
What's surprising to me is...

01:58.661 --> 02:00.412
the campaign couldn't get
their hands around this.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.539
I mean, Harry Marshall is as good
as they come, but--

02:02.623 --> 02:05.333
First they denied,
and then they equivocated--

02:05.417 --> 02:06.919
I mean, that's just, like, ridiculous.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.420
You just come out,
"I apologize. We misspoke."

02:09.503 --> 02:10.588
Everybody knows the drill here.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.300
And it's not like the Republicans
rushed in to save the day either.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.178
-Uh, off message throughout.
-[Van Jones] They got quiet.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.596
Which I will never understand.

02:18.681 --> 02:22.225
Will Conway was a rising star
in the party.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.187
Look, it's hard to compete
with the Underwood machine.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.273
Oh, God. Let's not do the whole
"black helicopters" crazy stuff.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.399
-[chuckling]
-It's ridiculous.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.110
Look, we need to accept
Underwood won the election.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.987
People need to accept the outcome
and move on.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.572
I'm gonna agree with Van.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.076
I think we need to take a moment
to appreciate the Constitution.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.079
-It bent, but it never broke.
-That's right.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.666
And in the end, as we all know,
it came down to the Electoral College.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.419
[Frank over cell phone]
<i>You don't have to say the words, Governor.</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:53.924
I think I do.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.930
Congratulations, Mr. President Elect.

03:01.514 --> 03:05.268
-There's no script for this one?
<i>-Country first, sir.</i>

03:05.352 --> 03:07.229
I'm glad to hear you say that, Will.

03:07.312 --> 03:11.274
I want to start to help the country
heal again.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.735
<i>Are we done?</i>

03:12.818 --> 03:16.071
We are done. But Will...

03:18.031 --> 03:23.370
I would very much like to show the country
that our two parties can work together.

03:23.453 --> 03:29.877
So I was hoping that you might consider
becoming my transportation secretary.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.589
<i>I think it would send a powerful message</i>
<i>if you agreed to join my cabinet.</i>

03:35.423 --> 03:41.096
You think I'd... make a good...
transportation secretary?

03:41.179 --> 03:43.140
Oh, yes.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.809
<i>That's what you give</i>
<i>the congressman from nowhere.</i>

03:45.893 --> 03:46.810
I'll be declining.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.688
<i>Well, I'm so sorry to hear that, Will.</i>
<i>And I wanted to wish you the very best.</i>

03:50.773 --> 03:53.566
You and your wishes
can go fuck yourselves!

03:53.650 --> 03:55.652
-[line disconnects]
-[button clicks]

03:56.737 --> 03:58.571
[reporters speaking indistinctly on TV]

04:06.371 --> 04:07.831
What do I do now?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.124
[reporter] <i>...everyone thought</i>
<i>it would happen.</i>

04:09.207 --> 04:11.084
<i>No one thought that</i>
<i>Underwood would win again...</i>

04:11.960 --> 04:13.336
I don't know.

04:17.589 --> 04:21.053
[inhales deeply] Acknowledging defeat
is never easy.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.264
Doing it in public
[clicks tongue] is a living hell.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.560
-Well, at least the cameras like him.
-[chuckles]

04:36.234 --> 04:38.320
Do I look satisfied?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.573
You look somewhat satisfied.

04:41.656 --> 04:45.786
-Good.
-Not good. Francis, enjoy this moment.

04:45.869 --> 04:49.372
-You deserve it.
-You mean "we."

04:50.457 --> 04:52.793
We made it to the other side.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.586
Yes.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.840
But what is on the other side?

04:59.049 --> 05:00.175
Victory.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.928
With a whiff of defeat.

05:04.512 --> 05:08.641
It's taken a long time to get here,
but we're here. Cheers, Francis.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.520
Everything gets easier from now on.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.522
Mmm.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.121
They're ready for you.

05:33.876 --> 05:36.044
-Hannah.
-I don't want to go.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.228
-Hey.
-No.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.812
[Hannah sighs]

06:00.360 --> 06:01.611
Fine.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.489
I'll do it on my own.

06:04.572 --> 06:08.618
I'm gonna say, this is a crucial moment.
For both of you. How you handle tonight.

06:08.701 --> 06:12.039
The party abandoned me. Your party.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.208
I'm not the Republican Party, Will.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.336
I work for candidates.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.672
I worked for you.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.758
Listen, you lost.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.429
But more than half the country
still considers you their president.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.764
This is what's required.
Go down there, give your speech.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.644
Concede.

06:38.773 --> 06:39.983
[sighs]

06:54.581 --> 06:55.790
[sighs]

07:52.514 --> 07:55.767
As I accept all of your letters
of resignation

07:55.850 --> 07:57.810
and dissolve my old cabinet,

07:58.395 --> 08:02.190
I wanna welcome each and every one of you
to my new cabinet.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.322
-Congratulations, Mr. President.
-Thank you, Cathy.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.533
And I especially wanna thank my wife.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.037
Madam Vice President...

08:15.662 --> 08:19.541
thank you for your unending
and unwavering support.

08:19.624 --> 08:24.004
Your steady hand kept this country
running this past month.

08:25.005 --> 08:29.426
I owe her more than I can possibly fathom.
And she owes me.

08:30.427 --> 08:34.389
Not true. You were with me all the way.

08:35.432 --> 08:40.602
I would like to make my first 100 days
as the duly elected president

08:40.687 --> 08:44.482
as productive as possible.
Of course, there are many challenges.

08:44.566 --> 08:48.111
Shoring up the economy,
securing our nation from ICO

08:48.195 --> 08:51.864
and reducing unemployment.
But the biggest challenge that we face,

08:51.948 --> 08:55.368
and the one that I'm going to need
all of your help on,

08:55.452 --> 09:00.498
is reuniting a country that has never been
more divided than it is today.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.918
I believe we can meet this challenge,

09:04.001 --> 09:06.296
and that's where I'm gonna need
all of your help.

09:06.379 --> 09:11.926
So let's let the healing begin today
and let's make history together.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.429
I thank you all
for your continued service.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.139
Now let's get back to work.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.688
[indistinct chatter]

09:33.281 --> 09:34.824
[Doug] I need a minute.

09:35.825 --> 09:40.037
I think we should see what we can do
about making Usher persona non grata.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.291
I don't think that's wise to start a war.
We've just won the White House.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.627
This is exactly when we should strike.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.379
This is a moment
that we have the political capital--

09:47.462 --> 09:50.465
Usher needs to be managed carefully.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.049
Mr. President?

09:52.134 --> 09:55.428
Take a breath, Doug.
We've only just landed on our feet here.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.222
Sir, Madam Vice President,

09:57.305 --> 09:59.974
this is the type of person
that we used to crucify in the House.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.227
Yes, but we're not in the House now.
We're here.

10:02.810 --> 10:06.022
We have a full term ahead of us.
There's gonna be a great deal

10:06.106 --> 10:08.150
that we're gonna be able to accomplish,
the three of us.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.403
I appreciate that, sir.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.905
But Mark Usher will become a problem.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.492
Well, everyone becomes a problem,
eventually.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.205
-[door closes]
-[Doug] LeAnn's out.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.081
What?

10:25.375 --> 10:26.751
[door closes]

10:26.834 --> 10:27.919
Why?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.467
She screwed up.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.262
Well, is it something
I need to get ready for?

10:37.345 --> 10:39.806
The Underwoods want this
handled indirectly.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.225
So what exactly are we saying?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.311
She's being pushed out.

10:44.394 --> 10:48.273
Okay, but the campaign's over.
Is it necessary to say anything?

10:48.356 --> 10:53.320
We need to distance this administration
from her and her work. Her tactics.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.406
So it needs to be a leak.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.992
Reach out to the people who don't like us.
They'll be prime to go with it.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.162
Okay, so when we respond...

11:02.245 --> 11:04.164
-On the record or...
-On.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.210
What did she do?

11:08.876 --> 11:11.379
She showed some very poor judgment.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.090
I'm trusting you to be discreet.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.678
We won, Seth. Changes need to be made.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.309
[Kate] You know I'm off politics.
Surprised you reached out to me.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.936
[LeAnn] You're a highly-respected
journalist.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.938
Just here for the inauguration
and the parties.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.022
Hmm.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.402
So I imagine you've heard
that I'm on the outs.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.446
They're not telling the whole story.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.031
So what happened?

11:39.115 --> 11:43.119
An acquaintance of mine stole
classified documents from the NSA

11:43.202 --> 11:44.704
and took off to Russia.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.749
They're blaming me for it.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.753
What did this acquaintance take?

11:52.670 --> 11:55.798
That's just the thing.
I have no idea.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.843
If you could find him, talk to him,

11:58.926 --> 12:02.096
he would tell you
that I had nothing to do with this.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.682
[sighs]

12:08.270 --> 12:10.062
Who is he? What's his name?

12:12.148 --> 12:13.275
Aidan Macallan.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.278
He'll talk to you.
He respects you.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.615
Tell him that I'm okay.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.618
That I'm going to be okay.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.871
I'm a firm believer
in boots on the ground.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.165
Well, we're there for the oil.
Let's not pretend.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.752
Oh, I'm not denying how crucial it is
to protect the oil supply.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.255
But it's in the world's best interest
that we're the ones keeping an eye on it.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.133
-On the world or the oil?
-Both.

12:39.216 --> 12:43.054
Oh. Well, that explains
your strong interest in Antarctica.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.641
I do focus on things and people.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.395
I tend to get attached, but I think
it makes me better at what I do.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.022
And what are you focused on now?

12:53.105 --> 12:57.610
Petrov. Ahmed Al Ahmadi. To begin with.

12:57.694 --> 12:58.861
[door opens]

13:02.865 --> 13:04.033
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

13:06.243 --> 13:10.498
I just...
Uh... I'll run this by you tomorrow.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.376
Yes, tomorrow.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.213
Sorry for the interruption.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.674
[door closes]

13:19.757 --> 13:21.551
He's one of our speechwriters.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.762
Tom Yates has quite a reputation.

13:26.013 --> 13:29.642
Well, if his books are any indication,
he has lived quite a life.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.311
My father wore striped socks.

13:34.856 --> 13:38.234
Do you think the president will be
sympathetic to our agenda?

13:38.860 --> 13:41.988
"Our agenda"? That's very presumptuous.

13:42.071 --> 13:46.158
Well, there are regions in the world that
are important to our national security

13:46.242 --> 13:47.952
and they have to be protected.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.287
Would you like to join us
at the inaugural ball?

13:50.372 --> 13:51.498
Oh, no, I can't.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.917
Something terrible always happens
when I go to a party.

13:57.795 --> 14:01.633
Uh, by the way,
my husband is not managed by anyone.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.427
-That's not what I'm asking.
-Isn't it?

14:04.511 --> 14:08.931
I'm asking for your help,
Madam Vice President. That is all.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.104
Evening.

14:15.187 --> 14:19.275
Oh, my God. Come in.
I'm sorry. Sit down, sit down.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.568
Aren't we working out tonight?

14:20.652 --> 14:23.571
Oh, I just don't think
I'm gonna have the time for it.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.783
-[stammers] But come sit for a minute.
-If you're too busy, I understand--

14:26.866 --> 14:29.202
No, no. Join me for a minute.
I want you to hear something.

14:38.169 --> 14:41.548
"This is the dawn of a new era.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.841
It's a time for peace.

14:43.925 --> 14:48.471
A time to respect the past
and embrace the future.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.806
A time..."

14:58.440 --> 14:59.482
Time to what?

14:59.566 --> 15:03.069
"A time to hear all the voices.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.988
For there is nothing more lonely...

15:07.949 --> 15:09.659
or terrifying...

15:12.662 --> 15:14.246
than feeling unheard."

15:18.167 --> 15:21.754
-What do you think?
-It's interesting. I like it.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.299
-This is for...
-My inauguration, yes.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.135
Where does it go from there?
What do you say?

15:28.219 --> 15:30.888
Uh, uh...

15:32.557 --> 15:34.684
"America, I hear you.

15:35.643 --> 15:39.939
Whether you voted for me or not,
I hear all of you."

15:42.024 --> 15:44.652
Now, what do you think
my great-great-great-grandfather

15:44.736 --> 15:46.403
would think of all this?

15:49.491 --> 15:52.076
-Awesome.
-[chuckling]

15:52.994 --> 15:55.412
-In the original sense of the word.
-Yeah.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.125
How long you in town for?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.753
Leaving tonight, actually.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.630
I thought you were here
for the inauguration.

16:03.713 --> 16:07.299
-I got a tip I have to move on.
-Mmm. What's the tip?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.093
-Mmm-mmm.
-[chuckles]

16:09.176 --> 16:11.471
We used to have a rule about shoptalk.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.764
-Did we?
-Mmm-hmm.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.348
Fair enough.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.522
What's your read on LeAnn Harvey?

16:22.064 --> 16:24.984
That she's hard to read.
That's what I like about her.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.111
-You trust her?
-[chuckles]

16:28.696 --> 16:29.864
Kate, come on.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.660
[sighs]

16:36.412 --> 16:38.039
You look tired.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.583
I'm working eight days a week.

16:41.584 --> 16:45.838
I mean, you always looked tired, but now
you look tired in a... not sexy way.

16:45.922 --> 16:46.923
[chuckles]

16:47.757 --> 16:49.216
Sorry to disappoint.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.260
I actually have to get back there
in a minute.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.138
Oh, it's little late
to head back to the office, right?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.894
I've been there since last Tuesday.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.647
Honestly...

17:03.606 --> 17:05.232
I know this sounds weird...

17:06.901 --> 17:08.444
There's no place I'd rather be.

17:12.489 --> 17:16.452
The way you say that sounds so... rote.

17:17.118 --> 17:18.621
I don't know...

17:21.207 --> 17:23.166
What am I supposed to say to that?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.089
I just want to know how you're doing,
that's all.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.218
I'm just asking about you,
this person I'm sitting with.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.061
Where'd you go, Tom Yates?

17:53.405 --> 17:55.617
-Hi.
-I was looking for you.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.077
Not very hard, then.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.246
I need to talk to you.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.415
Okay.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.376
I'm done.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.923
With the speechwriting,
I don't want to do it anymore.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.343
I want to get back to some other stuff
I was working on.

18:14.426 --> 18:18.555
No offense. I mean,
I know writing speeches is writing...

18:19.473 --> 18:21.267
but it's not what I really wanna do.

18:25.855 --> 18:26.981
Okay.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.442
You sure?

18:32.153 --> 18:33.154
Yes.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.533
We'll transition you out.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.495
But you'll need to have a reason
to be here.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.881
Special advisor? Are you kidding me?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.466
-There's speculation that he's already--
-It's not speculation, Seth.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.178
People know that Mark Usher
is working for us in some capacity.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.346
-I mean, isn't that enough?
-Clean up this release.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.849
Uh, reaching across party lines,
that sort of thing.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.475
-And get it ready, just in case.
-[Seth] Of course.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.560
That's it.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.399
I know you're not happy about this.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.402
-What has he done to earn the title?
-This is not about him earning anything.

19:13.485 --> 19:17.198
He's already getting classified memos.
Why does she want this?

19:18.908 --> 19:19.909
"She"?

19:23.037 --> 19:25.164
I'm sorry. The vice president.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.918
What she wants is
for this administration to succeed.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.714
And what I want is for you
to befriend him. Get to know him.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.467
We want him to think he's managing us
while we're busy managing him.

19:39.386 --> 19:42.056
She has been pursuing Francis Underwood
for a long time.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.308
-I don't wanna talk to her.
-Aidan...

19:44.392 --> 19:45.851
How does she even know I'm here?

19:45.935 --> 19:48.145
Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.774
[chuckles] Yeah, going public
will not help you, or me.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.361
You'll tell her how you manipulated
the American mood, hmm?

19:55.444 --> 19:58.530
-How you helped steal an election.
-That would be it for me.

19:58.614 --> 20:02.076
You're a valued guest
of the Russian state.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.245
I want my passport back.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.164
An American passport is the last thing
that will keep you safe.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.791
I'll take my chances.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.257
This will make you famous, hmm?
A whistle-blower.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.549
I don't wanna be famous.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.637
But you do want to be free.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.642
[Doug scoffs]

20:29.645 --> 20:33.399
You spent $15,000 at The Capital Grille?
What the fuck are you eating?

20:33.482 --> 20:36.068
-This is Romero using the House Ethics--
-It's a liability.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.778
And you should know better.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.114
How did you not disclose this, Terry?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.366
I want to pull him off
his committee assignments.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.952
Put him on Science.
See how he likes NASA briefings.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.746
I'd like to hold off on that.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.623
Romero's about to become
an ally to the president.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.376
And why's that?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.629
Because he was able
to find out about your tab.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.924
It's because he's relentless.

20:58.007 --> 21:02.178
Because in four years,
35% of the vote in Arizona will be Latino.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.472
Because he's the future.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.895
This is how it starts.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.606
I gotta get back to the Hill.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.026
You know, Doug...

21:18.235 --> 21:21.488
you and I, we've been around long enough
to see the guard change.

21:21.572 --> 21:25.159
And it changes because the people
at the top forget how they got there.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.996
Romero's trying to change the guard, Doug.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.873
And we are the guard.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.132
If Congressman Womack has nothing to hide,
he has nothing to fear.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.803
[Doug] We all have something to hide,
Congressman Romero.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.513
It's time for a change in the leadership.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.893
The president would like
to be a friend to you,

21:50.977 --> 21:52.979
but you're making it very difficult.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.986
We can guarantee the immigration ban
will be lifted in the next week.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.113
Come on. Are we doing this again?

22:02.196 --> 22:04.115
You offer me some racist gesture.

22:04.198 --> 22:08.160
And I, what? I'm a friend forever?
Ban isn't even sustainable.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.495
What matters to you?

22:09.578 --> 22:11.163
-The president's attention.
-You have it.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.666
-His full attention--
-You know, that's enough.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.882
What is it that you really want?

22:21.465 --> 22:24.093
I want Medicare coverage
bumped up to where it was.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.264
There are retirees in my district.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.308
We're here now
because you want a bump in Medicare?

22:31.392 --> 22:33.019
Come on, Congressman.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.980
And two seats to the inauguration.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.399
-We are two days out.
-On the dais.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.943
You are going about this entirely wrong.

22:41.527 --> 22:45.406
You came here. You asked me.

22:45.489 --> 22:46.908
I'm telling you.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.326
I want to be there
when Francis Underwood says to me

22:49.410 --> 22:51.370
that there will be an increase
in Medicare.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.122
He does that, I'm his friend.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.708
Well, I think I speak for the president
when I say that's not going to happen.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.962
Mr. Stamper, I really appreciate
all the work you do for him,

23:00.046 --> 23:04.008
but you and I know
that my bloc is growing.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.969
All I'm looking for is a line
in his address.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.973
Two seats and a line.

23:12.058 --> 23:15.561
-The balls on him.
-[Doug] I told him it was highly doubtful.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.897
-I can get back to him with a firm no.
-Or you could give him a line.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.192
His promises are unreliable.

23:21.275 --> 23:24.570
Look, I know Alex.
We met on Conway's campaign.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.904
Once he's in, he's in.

23:25.988 --> 23:29.116
Sir, we have to be very careful
with what we're giving away.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.161
He's capable of giving this administration
an enormous amount of grief.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.371
He's asking for a gesture.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.582
Oh, I'd say it's a little more than that.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.418
I completely agree. He's going after
the people who got us here.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.962
He's not wrong, is he?

23:41.045 --> 23:43.005
There are some in leadership
whose time has come and gone.

23:43.880 --> 23:48.635
Look... I'm just here to make sure
your four years turn into eight, but...

23:48.719 --> 23:50.387
it's up to you, of course.

23:51.638 --> 23:55.726
But we're talking about two seats...
one line...

23:58.604 --> 23:59.981
Give him what he wants.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.739
[Mark] Alex.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.867
Tilda. It's lovely to see you.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.827
-How are you, Congressman?
-Oh, I'm fine.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.122
It's good of you all to be here.
It's a big day.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.790
Listen, why don't the two of you
take my seats?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.459
Oh, thanks,
but we're already on the aisle.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.960
I insist.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.380
You'll be right in the president's
line of vision when he...

24:24.463 --> 24:26.257
says what you want to hear.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.176
Please. I can be anywhere.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.345
Okay.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.265
-Thank you, Mark.
-Sure.

24:38.394 --> 24:42.648
[chief justice] I, Francis J. Underwood,
do solemnly swear...

24:42.731 --> 24:45.859
I, Francis J. Underwood,
do solemnly swear...

24:45.942 --> 24:48.404
That I will faithfully execute...

24:48.487 --> 24:50.489
That I will faithfully execute...

24:50.572 --> 24:53.492
The office
of President of the United States.

24:53.575 --> 24:57.121
The office of Pres--
Yes, here we go again.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.581
Secretary of State. That's what I wanted.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.918
That's all I wanted.
That's what I was promised.

25:03.502 --> 25:08.715
And now, here I am,
President of these United States.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.471
You made this bed, America.
You voted for me.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.642
Are you confused?

25:18.725 --> 25:20.644
Are you afraid?

25:20.727 --> 25:23.939
Because what you thought
you wanted is now here.

25:24.022 --> 25:29.236
And there you are, staring back,
slack-jawed, bewildered,

25:29.320 --> 25:32.323
wondering if this is what
you actually asked for.

25:32.406 --> 25:37.411
This democracy,
your democracy, elected me.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.580
And if you think it was hard getting here,

25:39.663 --> 25:42.749
you're beginning to understand
what I'm willing to do to stay.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.212
I look across at this crowd gathered today

25:46.295 --> 25:48.714
and I know that
these are not my supporters.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.717
I'm looking at people who are waiting,

25:51.800 --> 25:55.512
with a smile on their face,
for their turn.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.181
And the most vicious among them

25:57.264 --> 26:00.601
are the ones who are smiling
and clapping the hardest.

26:01.227 --> 26:04.521
Power is a lot like real estate. Remember?

26:04.605 --> 26:07.399
-[chief justice] So help me God.
-So help me God.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.527
[crowd cheering]

26:26.752 --> 26:30.005
America, I hear you.

26:30.797 --> 26:33.342
I hear all your voices.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.053
I hear your struggles, your concerns,

26:37.138 --> 26:41.642
but most of all, I hear your hope.

26:41.725 --> 26:45.521
Opportunity and security is
what we all want.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.483
And in my first 100 days,
I will reach across party lines

26:49.566 --> 26:53.904
and devote my administration,
your government, to securing them.

26:53.987 --> 27:00.452
For too long we have ignored our seniors
and the healthcare they depend on.

27:02.496 --> 27:06.417
That is why I am committed
to fixing Medicare

27:06.500 --> 27:09.753
before I devote one more dime
to the program.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.923
AmWorks was only the beginning.

27:13.006 --> 27:16.427
We have to learn to live
without entitlements,

27:16.510 --> 27:20.222
because we are not an entitled people.

27:20.306 --> 27:25.436
I believe in your sweat.
I believe in your hard work.

27:25.519 --> 27:29.231
And a job,
that's what I'll promise you today.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.192
[crowd cheering and applauding]

<i>You couldn't give him one line?</i>

27:37.323 --> 27:39.658
We give no quarter
to those that are disloyal.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.411
<i>The message sent today</i>
<i>wasn't just for him.</i>

27:42.494 --> 27:45.539
-Alex feeds off of retribution.
<i>-So do I.</i>

27:45.622 --> 27:48.083
<i>-Is he worth the fight?</i>
-There is no neutrality.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.127
I expect total loyalty
or you are an enemy.

27:52.213 --> 27:54.465
Understood, Mr. President.

27:54.548 --> 27:55.674
[button clicks]

27:59.345 --> 28:00.679

28:14.485 --> 28:15.652
[chuckles]

28:15.736 --> 28:18.447
I have a soft spot
for that patriotic stuff.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.209
Please spread your arms and legs.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.586
Excuse me?

28:32.669 --> 28:34.921
Otherwise, there is no interview.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.054
And if you would please
take off your jacket.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.725
-I'm a journalist.
-I know.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.310
I read you when I was living in London.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.688
-So I'm not a spy.
-I know you're not a spy.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.024
Does anyone even use that word anymore?

28:56.943 --> 28:58.987
So the interview won't be happening here.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.948
-Uh, we agreed--
-We need to move you to another location.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.993
Oh, and I'm sorry,
you cannot use your own crew.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.747
-That's unacceptable.
-Then the interview will have to wait.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.707
We cannot trust your people.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.877
And you wouldn't want to endanger
Mr. Macallan, would you?

29:15.921 --> 29:17.964
Are you coming, Miss Baldwin?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.807
And your cell phone needs to stay here.

29:28.309 --> 29:29.976
-[man speaking Russian]
-Thank you.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.446
You have a lot of support out there,

29:40.529 --> 29:43.114
no matter what the president did
or didn't say.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.241
There are people eager to work with you.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.786
I should tell you...

29:48.704 --> 29:51.790
I'm encouraging the Republicans to
restart the Declaration of War Committee,

29:51.873 --> 29:53.792
to investigate the president.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.252
That's bold.

29:56.337 --> 29:59.298
-I'm not trying to impress you with that.
-It's risky.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.302
You don't want an enemy
in the White House.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.805
-But you're in the White House now.
-[chuckles]

30:07.723 --> 30:09.140
And you're what to me?

30:11.518 --> 30:13.354
Why don't you let me help you?

30:14.480 --> 30:18.484
Everybody doesn't have to lose
for you to win, right?

30:22.070 --> 30:23.489
[Seth] <i>Is Sean Jeffries there?</i>

30:24.365 --> 30:27.117
-Who's calling?
<i>-Who's this?</i>

30:27.200 --> 30:29.160
I work for Tom Hammerschmidt.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.497
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>why I was transferred to you.</i>

30:32.498 --> 30:35.626
The receptionist is a friend of mine.
I know him. She knows him.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.086
<i>Well, I've been trying</i>
<i>to reach him all day.</i>

30:38.169 --> 30:40.005
I can take a message.

30:40.088 --> 30:44.009
<i>-No, I'll try him later.</i>
-Look, he doesn't work here anymore, so...

30:45.218 --> 30:47.929
-I'm his girlfriend.
<i>-That's all right.</i>

30:49.305 --> 30:51.767
-Who is this?
-Don't worry about it.

30:54.561 --> 30:55.812
[line disconnects]

30:59.024 --> 31:02.778
Hey, it's Seth Grayson.
I've got something for you.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.155
LeAnn Harvey, she's being pushed out.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.949
Yeah, she's out.

31:08.492 --> 31:13.705
Yeah, well, you're the only one
that's got me telling you at this point.

31:14.748 --> 31:17.834
Okay. I'm writing the release right now.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.127
All right, bye.

31:20.754 --> 31:21.963
[sighs]

31:24.883 --> 31:27.052
Hey, it's Seth Grayson.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.554
Yeah, I got something for you.

31:33.809 --> 31:38.354
Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go,
but the FSB replaced the crew.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.651
You have something on your tooth.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.070
[LeAnn sighs]

31:50.116 --> 31:51.868
Do we know where they were going?

31:51.952 --> 31:54.245
No, but they're still being tracked.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.457
Kate Baldwin was never
supposed to talk to him.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.542
-This interview cannot happen.
-We still have time.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.419
No, we don't.

32:01.211 --> 32:02.337
We need to go in.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.423
And there might be some
unforeseen consequences.

32:08.218 --> 32:13.181
I don't think Aidan would reveal anything
that would endanger me... or anyone else.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.518
How far back do you and he go?

32:17.143 --> 32:18.061
Far.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.482
That's all.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.610
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.446
I don't need your sympathy.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.581
You almost ready?

32:39.500 --> 32:44.880
God damn it. I can't find my "F."
Someone must have stolen it.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.549
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.927
Tom, you look very handsome in a tuxedo.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.597
I act like a man that can wear a tuxedo

32:53.680 --> 32:56.600
and suddenly I'm a man
who can wear a tuxedo.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.977
-[chuckles]
-This should do for now.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.105
-I just saw that Eric Rawlings arrived.
-Yes.

33:02.856 --> 33:05.901
Tom, we'll meet you downstairs
in just a few minutes.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.110
Sure.

33:09.696 --> 33:13.324
Stamper tells me that we'll have a bead
on Macallan's location

33:13.408 --> 33:14.993
in about an hour or so.

33:15.076 --> 33:19.289
I just spoke to Jane Davis.
Her contacts are ready and waiting.

33:20.290 --> 33:23.043
-We'll have distance, Francis.
-We'll owe her.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.134
You look very beautiful. Presidential.

33:32.135 --> 33:35.972
You look beautiful. Vice Presidential.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.527
[Tom] Here we are.
The night of Zoe's death.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.115
Who does that look like to you?

33:54.783 --> 33:57.285
Just another white guy
waiting for the train.

33:58.829 --> 33:59.913
Look closer.

34:04.626 --> 34:08.797
I know who you think it might be, but...
I'm really not sure.

34:10.005 --> 34:12.007
[breathes deeply]

34:21.893 --> 34:23.436
Yeah, shut that door.

34:25.355 --> 34:31.069
Gerald Ford's son used to sneak up
these stairs to go to the roof,

34:31.152 --> 34:32.987
play Led Zeppelin to his friends.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.157
[Eric] Teenagers are teenagers,
doesn't matter where.

34:36.241 --> 34:41.871
And this... is where Viktor Petrov
put out his cigar.

34:45.792 --> 34:49.630
-That guy seems like a real piece of work.
-Oh, believe me, he is.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.007
So are you.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.802
No, I don't know about that.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.698
-What are you doing?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.626
And what are you sorry about?

35:30.796 --> 35:34.049
I thought you wanted something
that you don't.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.845
So what is it that you think I wanted?

35:38.929 --> 35:41.973
[stammering] We can go back up. I'm...
I'm really s--

35:44.350 --> 35:48.313
You know, they say the most vulnerable
part of the human body...

35:50.065 --> 35:51.983
is the throat...

35:54.110 --> 35:58.364
and that you never really know
how you feel about somebody...

36:00.075 --> 36:04.495
until they have their hands
around your throat.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.543
[softly] So tell me.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.131
How do you feel now?

36:29.187 --> 36:31.022
Congratulations, Mr. President.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.743
[Eric moaning]

36:43.493 --> 36:45.453
[man speaking Russian]

36:48.707 --> 36:52.460
Before I forget,
LeAnn Harvey wanted me to say hello.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.588
How is she?

36:55.671 --> 36:56.965
Well, she wanted me to tell you

36:57.048 --> 37:00.093
that she's... she's all right.
She's gonna be all right.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.847
[stammers] What does that mean?

37:05.724 --> 37:09.728
She's, um, taking a leave of absence.
Well, that's what they're calling it,

37:09.811 --> 37:13.982
but it... it seems that she's being
pushed out of the administration.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.152
-Mmm-hmm.
-She's the one who told me you were here.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.694
Suggested I talk to you.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.241
LeAnn hired you, isn't that right?

37:23.324 --> 37:24.617
Friend of the family?

37:24.700 --> 37:25.786
[breathing heavily]

37:26.828 --> 37:28.038
Uh...

37:29.122 --> 37:32.918
Yeah, um,
are we starting the interview now?

37:33.001 --> 37:36.421
No, no. We're just talking.
But we should be ready soon.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.757
[stammers] I'm sorry.

37:38.840 --> 37:43.303
Can I, uh... Can I just have a second
before we start?

37:44.387 --> 37:46.597
-[Kate] I think so. Sure. Um...
-Okay.

37:46.681 --> 37:50.435
Um... Yeah. I'm...
I'm gonna need some air.

37:58.484 --> 38:01.737
No, I just... I just need a second, okay?

38:01.822 --> 38:04.449
Of course. Get some air.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.533
Okay.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.664
[man 1 speaking Russian]

38:13.208 --> 38:15.210
[continues speaking Russian]

38:18.755 --> 38:20.548
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

38:34.687 --> 38:36.689
[man 2 speaking Russian]

38:38.817 --> 38:40.986
[continues speaking Russian]

38:50.996 --> 38:52.998
[Aidan] Hey, hey, hey. I want your phone.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.126
I need your phone. Take this.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.170
One call.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.090
One.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.725
[cell phone vibrating]

39:15.561 --> 39:16.771
Hello?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.356
[Aidan] <i>LeAnn, it's me.</i>

39:21.067 --> 39:22.693
My God, Aidan.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.446
<i>I know you're in trouble.</i>
<i>Here's the plan.</i>

39:25.530 --> 39:27.448
<i>All right. Get a pen.</i>
<i>Write down this number.</i>

39:27.532 --> 39:29.951
<i>He... he's a lawyer.</i>
<i>He can get you out of the country.</i>

39:30.035 --> 39:32.370
<i>Once you're in Russia, I can protect you.</i>

39:33.496 --> 39:34.705
I'm sorry.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.416
<i>Why?</i>

39:42.463 --> 39:43.882
Oh.

39:44.674 --> 39:48.970
[sighs] <i>How long do I have</i>
<i>before they come and get me?</i>

39:50.555 --> 39:52.390
They're right outside.

39:52.473 --> 39:53.808
<i>And if I run?</i>

39:54.976 --> 39:58.063
Uh, people will get hurt.
You don't want to do that.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.196
I like Texas.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.156
<i>Maybe it's the sun or the dust,</i>

40:08.239 --> 40:10.992
<i>but people kind of squint</i>
<i>when they say hello.</i>

40:11.076 --> 40:12.535
<i>I always liked that.</i>

40:14.162 --> 40:15.788
<i>I never should've left.</i>

40:17.040 --> 40:18.959
You've always been very good to me.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.710
<i>I liked your mother.</i>

40:22.212 --> 40:24.172
<i>I liked her a lot.</i>

40:24.255 --> 40:26.424
I'm really sorry.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.675
Don't be.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.886
<i>There's a guard</i>
<i>on the second floor working with us.</i>

40:30.971 --> 40:33.598
<i>He'll escort you to a corner</i>
<i>where a cab will be waiting.</i>

40:33.681 --> 40:35.391
<i>Someone will open the door. Just...</i>

40:36.642 --> 40:37.978
<i>get in.</i>

40:38.061 --> 40:39.395
So you don't miss Texas?

40:40.688 --> 40:41.982
No, I do.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.279
[Mr. Barnes over phone] <i>I'm trying</i>
<i>to find some peace with this</i>

40:48.363 --> 40:49.364
<i>and you're not helping.</i>

40:49.447 --> 40:52.075
-[Tom] Just a couple more questions.
<i>-I'm moving, you know.</i>

40:52.951 --> 40:54.995
<i>-I got a new job--</i>
-[stammers] Mr. Barnes?

40:55.078 --> 40:57.455
They ruled your daughter's death
an accident.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.914
I am starting to doubt that.

40:59.624 --> 41:03.086
<i>-Could we just go over one or two more--</i>
-You know what?

41:03.169 --> 41:05.171
I just can't keep doing this.

41:05.255 --> 41:07.382
-Stop calling me, please.
-[phone beeps]

41:13.013 --> 41:14.472
[continues speaking Russian]

41:15.931 --> 41:18.434
[in English] The interview
will not be happening.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.436
Someone will escort you
back to your hotel.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.147
[speaks Russian]

41:24.983 --> 41:27.360
[jazz band playing]

41:31.614 --> 41:32.865
Mr. President.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.493
I hope I'm not too late to the party.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.496
I'd say you were just in time
to make your grand entrance.

41:38.579 --> 41:41.207
Well, when all this started,
I don't think I imagined myself

41:41.291 --> 41:44.169
-standing here with you tonight.
-[chuckles]

41:44.252 --> 41:46.254
-Congratulations, Mr. President. Again.
-Oh, thank you.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.381
-[chuckles]
-Um, should I wait for you?

41:48.464 --> 41:50.633
No, no. I'll see you inside the party.

41:53.303 --> 41:55.763
So... how's Romero?

41:55.846 --> 41:58.016
Well, Romero wants to get the Republicans

41:58.099 --> 42:00.726
to restart
the Declaration of War Committee.

42:00.810 --> 42:04.230
What a lovely inauguration gift.
Don't tell me you're surprised.

42:04.314 --> 42:05.815
I'm not.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.068
I'll see you inside. Get a drink.

42:13.073 --> 42:16.034
Well, don't you look stunning.

42:17.327 --> 42:19.412
It's been a long night, Frank.

42:19.495 --> 42:22.832
-I need to get home.
-Oh, come on. Do me the honor.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.001
Not tonight.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.476
[music continues playing in distance]

43:24.977 --> 43:26.896
[sighs]

43:41.076 --> 43:42.703
[woman chuckles] No, absolutely.

43:46.499 --> 43:49.252
-Doug! Don't you look good.
-Thank you, Madam Vice President.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.921
-Have you seen Francis?
-Not for a little while, no, ma'am.

43:52.004 --> 43:54.840
Well, the party's breaking up.
I want him to say goodbye to people.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.842
-Yes, ma'am. I'll let him know.
-Um, Doug?

43:58.553 --> 44:00.638
I have a question for you.
Just a small thing.

44:01.222 --> 44:04.225
-What is it?
-Why weren't you at the beheading?

44:04.892 --> 44:07.145
-What?
-The night James Miller was beheaded.

44:08.103 --> 44:10.105
We were all there, the four of us.

44:10.190 --> 44:13.151
Francis, Tom, LeAnn and myself.

44:13.234 --> 44:14.485
Why not you?

44:16.154 --> 44:18.656
You see Francis,
tell him I'm looking for him.

44:18.739 --> 44:19.990
Yes, ma'am.

44:36.174 --> 44:40.511
-I thought you got lost.
-No. I just needed a break.

44:41.637 --> 44:45.099
-Shall we bid our guests farewell?
-No, the night is young.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.519
Look what I found.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.483
[sighs]

44:59.697 --> 45:01.657
They're restarting the committee.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.620
I thought we killed that committee.

45:05.703 --> 45:08.373
[scoffs] Nothing ever really dies
in the House.

45:08.456 --> 45:13.127
It just plays in front of a smaller
and smaller audience.

45:16.381 --> 45:19.259
-This is serious.
-I know.

45:20.635 --> 45:23.137
But let's enjoy the rest of the party.

45:39.279 --> 45:41.281
-[band stops playing]
-[guests applauding]

45:46.827 --> 45:47.953
Hey.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.958
What do you do here?

45:54.460 --> 45:55.753
I work for them.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.380
[speaking indistinctly]

46:00.007 --> 46:02.510
The president asked me to make sure
that you get home safely.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.638
-I have a car for you.
-I thought I'd stay a little while longer.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.308
The president has
an early morning tomorrow. Right this way.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.661
[breathes deeply]

46:30.996 --> 46:32.457
[Frank] The tour guide?

46:36.502 --> 46:38.128
-What?
-Yes.

46:38.921 --> 46:42.717
WTF. What am I supposed to do
about the tour guide?

46:45.177 --> 46:47.763
The press briefing room, Tom, really?

46:49.307 --> 46:50.433
[exhales deeply]

46:51.392 --> 46:53.478
I didn't think anyone would care.

46:54.144 --> 46:57.732
Well, should I... keep her on
or let her go?

46:57.815 --> 47:01.318
I mean, it was rather unprofessional
on her part.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.115
She's good at her job.

47:09.660 --> 47:10.745
Tom...

47:12.079 --> 47:14.123
don't cheat on my wife.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.255
[sighs]

47:26.511 --> 47:28.721
[indistinct chatter]

47:37.938 --> 47:39.189
Mr. Barnes?

47:41.942 --> 47:45.946
Do you want to get a coffee
somewhere away from this?

47:47.448 --> 47:49.450
I keep thinking about what you said.

47:54.079 --> 47:56.081
I found this with her things.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.335
It was Father's Day...

48:00.420 --> 48:02.337
the last time I heard from her.

48:02.422 --> 48:03.964
We weren't close.

48:05.049 --> 48:06.801
I was surprised she called.

48:07.384 --> 48:10.095
I mean, I was happy, of course, but...

48:11.597 --> 48:13.223
Can I hold on to this?

48:18.479 --> 48:19.564
I didn't know...

48:21.774 --> 48:23.275
that she was in trouble.

48:26.070 --> 48:29.657
When the police asked if I thought
she was suicidal, I said, "Maybe."

48:34.537 --> 48:36.163
I didn't know her, really.

48:37.707 --> 48:39.750
[Tom] Neither did I.

48:42.462 --> 48:43.879
I'll look into this.

48:46.423 --> 48:47.424
Okay.

48:48.718 --> 48:49.844
Thank you.

49:03.315 --> 49:06.276
<i>Politico.</i> Five minutes on <i>Morning Joe.</i>

49:06.360 --> 49:09.655
-Was a press release really necessary?
-You're taking a leave.

49:10.906 --> 49:12.575
The press release said
that you were taking a leave

49:12.658 --> 49:14.660
to consider your career options.

49:14.744 --> 49:17.121
This has to look real. You know that.

49:18.205 --> 49:19.665
What if they need to meet with me?

49:21.917 --> 49:23.252
Then they'll meet with you.

49:31.301 --> 49:32.469
[scoffs]

49:32.553 --> 49:34.889
I could have security escort you out.

49:40.853 --> 49:42.104
[scoffs]

49:43.438 --> 49:47.484
So since Usher is special advisor now,
where does that leave you?

49:50.946 --> 49:53.866
Like I said,
they'll call you if they need you.

49:59.204 --> 50:01.791
I can be a friend to you, you know.

50:02.958 --> 50:06.003
-It doesn't have to be like this.
-I don't have any friends.

50:22.227 --> 50:26.065
[Davis] I landed him
at the Jordanian Embassy in Paris.

50:27.357 --> 50:28.943
When do we plan to get him out?

50:30.194 --> 50:32.863
Well, as I understand it,
you don't yet know

50:32.947 --> 50:35.783
what Mr. Macallan may have told
President Petrov.

50:35.866 --> 50:39.369
[Frank] I want Macallan back here
sooner rather than later.

50:39.453 --> 50:42.414
It's better if these things don't happen
on American soil.

50:43.165 --> 50:47.336
-Yes, but I make those decisions.
-Of course, Mr. President.

50:48.671 --> 50:49.797
And rest assured,

50:49.880 --> 50:52.758
neither of your fingerprints
are anywhere near this.

50:58.764 --> 51:00.015
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

51:00.975 --> 51:02.685
So what do we do about LeAnn?

51:05.145 --> 51:09.650
She's been involved in election fraud,
for Christ's sake.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.987
She's made a lot of mistakes.

51:14.238 --> 51:19.076
-Yes, but lots of people have.
-Yes, but some people run their course.

51:22.204 --> 51:24.456
It's hard to know who to trust these days.

51:25.332 --> 51:26.500
Isn't it?

51:27.305 --> 51:33.458
