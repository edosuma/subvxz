00:03.600 --> 00:05.800
(Thumping)

00:13.880 --> 00:15.980
Claire. There's a girl
in Luke's bed.

00:15.980 --> 00:17.250
Where's Luke?

00:17.250 --> 00:19.550
With the girl!
(groans drowsily)

00:19.550 --> 00:22.150
Should we just make a noise
and scare her off?

00:22.150 --> 00:24.280
Is it a girl or a possum?

00:26.320 --> 00:28.120
Honey, there's no one there.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.750
There <i> was.</i>
I saw girl bumps and hair.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.659
It was probably
just his Chewbacca doll.

00:32.659 --> 00:34.990
It's not a doll.
It's a plush action figure.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.070
Well, as long as he's
sleeping with that thing,

00:37.070 --> 00:38.600
it's the only action
he's gettin'.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.430
I'm so relieved.
I wasn't ready for that.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.110
You thought you saw something
that wasn't there.

00:44.110 --> 00:47.080
It's dark, and we shared
an entire bottle of wine.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.710
It <i> is</i> dark. I didn't see you
do air quotes around "shared."

01:04.629 --> 01:06.460
All right. These contracts
are good to go.

01:06.460 --> 01:07.920
All that's left
is the inspection.

01:07.930 --> 01:09.100
Already scheduled it.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.800
Andy, if I could bottle you up

01:10.800 --> 01:12.970
and put you into a cologne,
you know what I'd call it?

01:12.970 --> 01:14.170
"Initiative."

01:14.170 --> 01:15.770
The black-and-white
commercial

01:15.770 --> 01:17.370
would have models
turning into panthers.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.140
"Initiative... a unisex
fragrance from California."

01:20.140 --> 01:22.300
I want to come back to this
because it's fun,

01:22.310 --> 01:24.370
but I need your advice.
Oh.

01:24.380 --> 01:25.980
You remember my cousin
back in Utah,

01:25.980 --> 01:27.440
the real-estate developer?
Yeah.

01:27.450 --> 01:28.950
Well, turns out
his V.P.'s leaving

01:28.950 --> 01:30.450
to start his own company,

01:30.450 --> 01:32.550
and my cousin needs someone,
like... like,<i> now.</i>

01:32.560 --> 01:34.130
Wow. That's a big opp...
Alex: Hey!

01:34.130 --> 01:37.850
Hey! What are you
doing home?

01:37.860 --> 01:39.660
Are you serious? School's out.
I'm home for the summer.

01:39.660 --> 01:41.120
You knew this.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.130
Must have slipped my mind.
I'm so glad you're back.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.040
That's it?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.400
Sanjay's parents
are throwing him

01:47.400 --> 01:48.800
a three-day
"Welcome Home" party.

01:48.810 --> 01:50.840
They even made him a suit
out of marigolds.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.080
(Thumping)

01:52.080 --> 01:55.380
Hey. This is
a nice surprise, pumpkin.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.550
Was I too subtle with the way
I put it on the calendar, or...

01:58.550 --> 02:01.320
(whistling)

02:01.320 --> 02:03.250
<i>Someone</i> woke up
in a good mood.
(chuckles)

02:03.250 --> 02:04.710
And there is only one reason

02:04.720 --> 02:06.510
a teenage boy is ever like that.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.520
Yep, because it's Family Camp
training day!

02:08.520 --> 02:10.020
Oh, I was gonna say,

02:10.030 --> 02:11.760
"The Harlem Globetrotters
must be in town."

02:11.760 --> 02:14.990
Luke and I are training
for the big... Famcathlon.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.900
You're, uh,
carb-loading.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.370
Good idea, buddy!

02:18.370 --> 02:19.440
Hungry dude.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.410
Hungry for Family Camp!

02:24.770 --> 02:27.500
Don't say "no" right away,
but picture me with <i> these.</i>

02:27.510 --> 02:30.180
Sweetie, you're 8 years old.
Give your body time to develop.

02:30.180 --> 02:32.180
These curls!
I want a perm!

02:32.180 --> 02:34.610
Take it from someone who had
a perm at your age... you <i> don't.</i>

02:34.620 --> 02:36.220
Okay, what do you think
of my airplane outfit?

02:36.220 --> 02:37.860
When I land in Missouri,
I want to blend right in.

02:37.860 --> 02:39.280
With what?
A jug band?

02:40.260 --> 02:41.920
Cameron:
I got a job this summer

02:41.920 --> 02:43.520
as an assistant
defensive coordinator

02:43.530 --> 02:45.090
for the Missouri State
football team.

02:45.090 --> 02:46.860
Go, Bears!
I'm going home.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.960
And I have been crazy with work,
which means

02:48.970 --> 02:51.370
Lily will be going back
and forth between the two of us.

02:51.370 --> 02:52.740
It <i> has</i> been a little tense

02:52.740 --> 02:54.240
putting together
a time-share agreement, though.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.570
I haven't been making it tense.

02:55.570 --> 02:56.900
You're the one
who treats our daughter

02:56.910 --> 02:58.640
like she's a vacation property
in Aruba.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.400
Maybe you should be promoted
to <i> very</i> defensive coordinator.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.810
There you go.
Okay, you typed up

03:02.810 --> 03:04.410
how we're gonna
share our daughter.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.310
What is this...
Some sort of custody agreement?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.790
(doorbell rings)
I just drafted
a document

03:07.790 --> 03:09.940
that reflects
what we discussed last night.

03:09.950 --> 03:12.410
You have a tendency
to forget about things
you agreed to, Cam.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.150
Okay, that's a bunch of hooey.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.630
Rich! I forgot to
bring up the towels.
That proves nothing.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.100
I wouldn't bother you,
but I'm late for court.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.650
It's really
very straightforward.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.160
If it rains for more
than three days in Missouri,

03:21.160 --> 03:22.420
that borrows against my time.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.830
Conversely, if Lily does go

03:23.830 --> 03:25.730
to gymnastics camp,
I get an extra week.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.970
It's too confusing.
Wait, you're a lawyer, right?

03:27.970 --> 03:30.010
Can I actually have you
take a peek at something for me?

03:30.010 --> 03:31.180
W-What are you doing?

03:31.180 --> 03:32.430
I'm lawyering up.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.100
Uh... uh, yeah.

03:34.110 --> 03:36.250
There's a lot of ambiguous
language in this contract.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.950
I wouldn't sign it.
Nobody's asking him to.

03:38.950 --> 03:41.420
You know, I never would have
agreed to give up 4th of July,

03:41.420 --> 03:42.950
and now I'm worried

03:42.950 --> 03:45.010
he's trying to trick me
out of Biscuit Bonanza.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.520
B-Biscuit Bonanza?
It's what it sounds like.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.980
It's a biscuit-baking
competition,

03:48.990 --> 03:50.490
and then you see who can
throw theirs the furthest.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.120
May I present Exhibit "A"?

03:52.130 --> 03:53.200
Cameron: That's fine, Mitchell.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.500
I don't care about 4th of July,

03:54.500 --> 03:55.930
as long as I get Lily
for Biscuit Bonanza.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.590
Lily:
Biscuit Bonanza?!

03:57.600 --> 03:59.870
Yeah. It's what it sounds like.
It's a biscuit-baking...

03:59.870 --> 04:02.140
Okay, I have never hated
the sound of my own voice more.

04:02.140 --> 04:03.440
Okay. I'm gonna go
pick up that costume.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.270
What costume?
Oh, my God, Cam.

04:05.270 --> 04:07.550
Cameron: Don't forget
about Pepper's brunch.
Okay, stop it!

04:08.710 --> 04:10.970
Isn't it your first day back
working with Claire?

04:10.980 --> 04:12.480
I got to
get this e-mail out first

04:12.480 --> 04:14.440
to a store
that got my order wrong.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.720
Do I look like a guy
who would wear a shirt

04:16.720 --> 04:18.720
with pineapples all over it?
Kinda.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.120
I want to use all caps
to get across how angry I am,

04:21.120 --> 04:25.320
but it takes forever to press
"shift" before each letter.

04:25.330 --> 04:27.060
Why don't you just
put on the caps lock?

04:27.060 --> 04:29.290
You can do that?
(chuckles) Oh, Jay.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.700
Just double-click here.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.630
Didn't work.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.910
That's because
you didn't double-click.

04:35.910 --> 04:37.040
You just clicked twice.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.710
The hell's the difference?

04:38.710 --> 04:40.010
Double-click. See?

04:40.010 --> 04:41.210
That's exactly what I did.

04:41.210 --> 04:42.480
Double... click.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.350
No, you're still
just clicking twice.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.080
Listen to me...
"Double-click."

04:46.080 --> 04:47.840
Not "Double... click."

04:47.850 --> 04:50.720
I'm not an idiot.
Double-click!

04:50.720 --> 04:53.020
You can't possibly think
that's the same thing!

04:53.020 --> 04:55.050
It's the exact same thing!
Double-click!

04:55.060 --> 04:56.860
Double-click!
Oh, what the...

04:56.860 --> 04:59.760
It's the first time
I've ever used the F-word.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.090
Ay, what's going on here?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.830
Even for me,
it's a little screamy!

05:02.830 --> 05:04.860
I'm going to work!
Wh...

05:04.870 --> 05:06.740
(huffs)
Why did you
get him so mad?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.700
I need him in a good mood.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.870
(door opens, closes)
I need to ask him
to go with me next week

05:10.870 --> 05:12.830
to JuÃ¡rez
to my cousin's wedding.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.770
Is that safe?

05:13.780 --> 05:15.410
Of course not.

05:15.410 --> 05:18.010
The invitation says
"Short run to the reception."

05:18.010 --> 05:19.940
What are the odds
the valet slid the seat back

05:19.950 --> 05:21.250
because of
my weirdly short arms?

05:21.250 --> 05:22.250
(laughs)

05:22.250 --> 05:23.440
(ringtone plays)
Oh.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.180
Shoot.
I should take this.

05:25.190 --> 05:28.790
Oh. Then <i> I...</i>
should take <i> this.</i>

05:28.790 --> 05:30.050
Evan. Hey.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.930
Look, I know why you're calling,

05:31.930 --> 05:33.960
and no,
I haven't changed my mind.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.860
(car door opens, closes)
I still don't want
the job.

05:35.870 --> 05:37.440
(music plays on stereo,
cellphone beeps)

05:37.430 --> 05:38.960
Evan: <i>So,
you're turning down a chance</i>

05:38.970 --> 05:40.900
<i>to move home
for your dream job...</i>

05:40.900 --> 05:43.360
<i>An actual career...
All because of a girl?</i>

05:43.370 --> 05:45.300
<i>This Haley must be
something special.</i>

05:45.310 --> 05:46.410
Hello?

05:46.410 --> 05:47.940
<i>I think I lost you.</i>

05:47.940 --> 05:48.970
(cellphone beeps)

05:48.980 --> 05:51.410
Hello? Evan?

05:51.410 --> 05:53.370
Dropped call.
I'll try him back.

05:54.650 --> 05:55.890
I knew it!

05:55.890 --> 05:57.120
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.790
Hey!
Good to have you back, Jay!

05:58.790 --> 06:00.160
Good to <i> be</i> back, buddy.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.930
Little trick of the trade...
when you don't know somebody's
name, you call 'em "buddy."

06:03.930 --> 06:04.990
Mm.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.720
(chuckles)

06:06.730 --> 06:07.930
So, the old office, huh?

06:07.930 --> 06:09.230
Mm.

06:09.230 --> 06:10.830
I see you got the lamp
over there now.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.060
I tried it there once.

06:12.070 --> 06:14.140
You'll see.
(chuckles)

06:14.140 --> 06:16.340
Your office is gonna be ready
this afternoon.

06:16.340 --> 06:17.810
Do you want to go
pick up your new...

06:17.810 --> 06:19.810
So, what are we working on?
Quarterly reports?

06:19.810 --> 06:22.810
Actually, no.
This is a personnel file.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.340
I have to fire Neal today.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.120
Neal?
Yeah... Neal.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.650
Works in the warehouse,
loves Canada, heavyset fella.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.280
Oh, you mean <i> "Big</i> Buddy."

06:30.290 --> 06:32.620
We are losing more
in shipping screw-ups
than he makes.

06:32.620 --> 06:33.750
It's time.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.290
You gonna do that now?
Oh. No.

06:35.290 --> 06:37.190
Um, actually, right now,
I was going to make copies

06:37.190 --> 06:39.020
of the agenda for
this afternoon's staff meeting.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.500
Let me do it.
How many do you need?

06:40.500 --> 06:41.470
Uh, 12 double-sided...

06:41.470 --> 06:42.920
Dad, are you sure?

06:42.930 --> 06:44.690
Do you even know
where the copy room is?

06:44.700 --> 06:46.600
Claire. Please.
I built this place.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.300
Okay.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.800
Other way.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.340
Woman: Hi, Jay.
Not now, buddy!

06:51.340 --> 06:53.810
That "buddy" stuff
may have worked for my dad,

06:53.810 --> 06:56.610
but I wanted a more personal
touch when I took over.

06:56.610 --> 06:59.440
I wanted this to be
a fun place to work,

06:59.450 --> 07:02.450
so I had an arcade dance game
installed in the warehouse.

07:02.450 --> 07:04.110
I figure
you give them a little sugar,

07:04.120 --> 07:06.890
takes the edge off when
you have to fire someone like...

07:06.890 --> 07:10.330
(crowd chanting "Neal!")

07:10.330 --> 07:11.630
What is going on?

07:11.630 --> 07:12.960
Dude, Neal is tearing it up

07:12.960 --> 07:14.720
on this dance machine...
Check out his score.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.830
Wow! He's pretty quick
on that thing.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.130
Oh, don't worry, Claire.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.830
He's never gonna
beat your record.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.510
You've had that for months.
No one's even come close.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.700
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.140
Okay. God.
Don't be defensive.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.410
Male voice:
<i>New high score!</i>

07:25.410 --> 07:26.580
I did it!

07:26.580 --> 07:28.980
(crowd cheering)
New high score!

07:28.980 --> 07:30.980
Oh.
Uh, s-sorry, Claire.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.580
Yikes. I would not want to be
the guy who just beat the boss.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.240
I actually <i> like</i> my job.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.410
(laughter)

07:37.420 --> 07:38.820
(laughing)

07:43.690 --> 07:45.250
Hey, can I get a zip?
I'm gonna take it.

07:45.260 --> 07:48.420
Pepper's parties are as fun
as they are confusing.

07:48.430 --> 07:50.160
Okay, stay with me on this one.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.100
Gender <i> Blender</i> Broadway Brunch.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.760
You dress as a Broadway
character of the opposite sex,

07:55.770 --> 07:57.770
and there's no solid food.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.230
It's a perfect party
if you're a show queen
with a broken jaw.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.770
Uh, excuse me.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.550
Sorry, Mr. Pritchett.
Your card has been declined.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.710
Oh, no, that's impossible.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.010
No, I ran it like three times.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.550
I think I'm supposed to cut it.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.420
Oh, no, no! Don't cut it!
I have some cash in the car.

08:09.420 --> 08:10.920
Can you just unzip me?
I think it's stuck.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.360
Oh, it <i> is</i> stuck.
You want me to cut it?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.610
No, no! Don't cut it!

08:13.620 --> 08:14.880
God. You really want
to cut something.

08:14.890 --> 08:16.260
I'll be right back.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.230
(car door closes)

08:18.230 --> 08:19.730
Oh, damn it!

08:19.730 --> 08:21.360
Excuse me.
How much for a picture?

08:21.360 --> 08:22.560
Oh, I'm actually not...

08:22.570 --> 08:23.870
Please. Our daughter
loves "Annie."

08:23.870 --> 08:25.700
(chuckles nervously)
Well, uh...

08:25.700 --> 08:28.200
actually,
I-I could use, like, $20.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.760
$20?
Wolverine was $10.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.430
Look, I don't want to fight.
I just... I just need...

08:31.440 --> 08:34.039
Hey, man.
What the hell?

08:34.039 --> 08:36.900
Ay! No, no, no!

08:36.909 --> 08:38.909
It's not easy to get Jay
to do what I want,

08:38.909 --> 08:41.909
so sometimes
I have to use my secret weapon.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.750
But when I'm too tired for that,

08:43.750 --> 08:46.980
I just play one of the movies
that make him cry like a baby.

08:46.990 --> 08:48.220
(crowd cheering)

08:48.220 --> 08:49.480
Is this "Rudy"?

08:49.490 --> 08:50.890
Oh, I love this movie.

08:50.890 --> 08:51.790
You do?

08:51.790 --> 08:53.750
(crowd chanting "Rudy!")

08:53.760 --> 08:56.390
Jay, I got us tickets
to the ballet,

08:56.400 --> 08:58.400
but I know
that you're golfing on Sunday.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.500
Whatever you want.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.960
You know, Rudy was small,

09:00.970 --> 09:02.970
(voice breaking)
but he had a big heart.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.800
Joe, what are
all these cartoons?

09:04.810 --> 09:07.150
Now all of Mommy's movies
are gone!

09:07.150 --> 09:08.770
Manny did it.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.780
What am I supposed to do
when I babysit this guy?

09:10.780 --> 09:11.780
Make conversation?

09:11.780 --> 09:13.450
The kid has two stories.

09:13.450 --> 09:15.280
Look. I'm a tree.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.740
That's the <i> good</i> one.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.080
Mom, why aren't you
calling me back?

09:19.090 --> 09:20.860
I'm at your work.
I need to talk.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.490
Uh, excuse me.
Have you seen Claire?

09:22.490 --> 09:24.020
Someone said she was down here.

09:24.030 --> 09:24.960
Uh, nope.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.160
(dance music plays)

09:27.160 --> 09:28.620
Claire:
I couldn't fire Neal.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.190
It would look like
I was only doing it

09:30.200 --> 09:32.130
to get back at him
for beating my record.

09:32.130 --> 09:34.000
Male voice: Game over!
(panting)

09:34.000 --> 09:35.100
(stomps, groans)

09:35.100 --> 09:36.100
So I had no choice...

09:36.110 --> 09:37.310
I had to beat Neal's score.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.680
(dance music plays)
Mm. Mm.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.930
(ringing)

09:39.940 --> 09:41.170
Manny: <i> Hello?</i>

09:41.180 --> 09:42.850
How do you work a copy machine?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.150
You can't be serious.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.450
I need to make
12 double-sided copies.

09:46.450 --> 09:47.780
It's an impossible task.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.440
Can't you just
ask someone for help?

09:49.450 --> 09:51.850
I made a big deal
out of coming back here to work.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.650
I'd like to appear useful.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.860
Wait. On the screen, there's an
exclamation mark. Is that good?

09:56.860 --> 09:59.060
I don't think it means it's
excited about what's happening.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.720
Did you put the original
in the tray?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.830
Tray? You mean
like a serving tray?

10:02.830 --> 10:05.730
Yes, Jay. I want you
to put papers in a serving tray.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.500
How have you remained alive?

10:07.500 --> 10:08.930
I found it!

10:09.870 --> 10:11.570
(beep, whirring)

10:11.570 --> 10:12.700
Yeah! Yeah!

10:12.710 --> 10:14.210
(rapid beeping)
Great! It's stuck!

10:14.210 --> 10:15.980
That's okay. Whatever you do,
don't pull the...

10:15.980 --> 10:17.150
Hold on.
I'm pulling it.

10:18.310 --> 10:19.670
No!

10:19.680 --> 10:21.380
(dance music plays)

10:21.380 --> 10:22.640
Ha! Yes!

10:22.650 --> 10:25.280
New high score!
Finally!

10:28.520 --> 10:31.420
(machine powers down)

10:31.430 --> 10:33.660
(voice breaking)
Are you hungry?
What's wrong?

10:33.660 --> 10:35.420
Is it Whitney Houston's
birthday again?

10:35.430 --> 10:37.730
No, honey, I'm just sad about
being away from you for so long.

10:37.730 --> 10:39.890
We still have
six hours together.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.330
Let's have a special day!

10:41.340 --> 10:42.670
(gasps)
Oh, that would be fun.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.430
We could take a bike ride
or have a picnic.

10:44.440 --> 10:49.280
I was thinking something
a little more <i> permanent.</i>

10:49.280 --> 10:51.880
Okay.
Prepare to receive.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.990
And remember, it's all about
the strength of the nestle.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.120
A tiny but noticeable red mark
on his neck?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.410
I'm not an idiot.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.780
Someone's been practicing
his orange grip.

11:02.790 --> 11:03.620
Pick up the pace!

11:03.630 --> 11:05.090
This is where we make up

11:05.090 --> 11:06.550
for your mom being so bad
at Hula-Hooping.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.620
Shoot!

11:10.600 --> 11:13.540
I randomly found this
in a bush under Luke's window.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.310
Alex probably asked Haley
to borrow them,

11:16.310 --> 11:17.940
Haley threw the pair,
Alex caught one,

11:17.940 --> 11:19.080
the other one
flew out the window,

11:19.080 --> 11:20.600
phone call came, they forgot.

11:20.610 --> 11:22.480
Girls.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.150
(groans)

11:26.150 --> 11:28.480
Oh, hey.
What are you doing home?

11:28.480 --> 11:29.880
(scoffs)

11:29.890 --> 11:31.990
Being crushed over and over
by family members.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.460
Hey.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.090
Got your message.

11:35.090 --> 11:37.230
I know you probably didn't mean
"Come over right away,"

11:37.230 --> 11:39.400
but you know how paranoidy
I can be, so...

11:39.400 --> 11:40.730
We should talk in my room.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.100
O...kay.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.070
Andy. Hey.
Hold on a sec.

11:44.070 --> 11:47.070
Um... I know we didn't
get to finish our talk earlier,

11:47.070 --> 11:49.640
because of
Alex's surprise pop-in.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.970
(magazine thuds)

11:50.970 --> 11:52.630
Listen.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.970
If you're not taking that job
in Utah because of me,

11:57.150 --> 11:58.550
you're making a mistake.

11:58.550 --> 11:59.950
I love you and me together,
but it would break my heart

11:59.950 --> 12:03.190
if I was the reason you gave up
this dream career opportunity,

12:03.190 --> 12:04.790
because, honestly,

12:04.790 --> 12:06.620
I don't know how much
of a future there is here.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.850
But... if our bond is as strong
as we think it is...

12:10.990 --> 12:12.650
we'll work our way
back to each other.

12:12.660 --> 12:13.750
Okay.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.090
What <i> he</i> said.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.640
Hey, what's all the buzz about?

12:26.640 --> 12:28.600
Somebody finally top
Neal's untoppable...

12:28.610 --> 12:29.950
What happened?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.450
Someone unplugged
the dance machine.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.780
So my high score's gone?

12:32.780 --> 12:34.010
Don't you mean
<i>Neal's</i> high score?

12:34.020 --> 12:36.950
No! I got an 805
like 20 minutes ago!

12:36.950 --> 12:38.380
(crowd murmuring)

12:38.390 --> 12:40.220
Oh, come on!
Y-You can't think

12:40.220 --> 12:42.980
that I'm really so upset
that I would actually...

12:42.990 --> 12:45.620
Damn, Claire. You didn't have to
go all "Black Swan" on the guy.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.130
(crowd groans)

12:47.130 --> 12:48.560
Hey!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.990
Are we really
not believing this woman?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.040
She's never been
anything but honest with us.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.370
When I screw up,
she lets me know it,

12:55.370 --> 12:56.960
but in a caring way.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.530
Same with you,
Bernard... Tom.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.640
Marie,<i> you</i> know it.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.900
It's time we started
appreciating this lady.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.910
She may have gotten an 800
on the dance game,

13:05.910 --> 13:07.210
but if you ask me,

13:07.220 --> 13:09.720
she gets a 1,000
on the boss game.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.420
Okeydoke.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.550
Hey.

13:16.560 --> 13:17.860
Hey.
Did you get the costumes?

13:17.860 --> 13:19.660
Barely. My credit card
was denied,

13:19.660 --> 13:21.860
and <i> someone</i> spent
all the cash we had in the car.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.860
Uh, yeah. Those are probably
both on me. I-I apologize.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.200
Let's maybe just forgive
<i>everything</i> I've done today.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.360
"Everything"?
What does that mean?

13:27.370 --> 13:30.270
It means <i> this!</i>
Ohhh, my God!

13:30.270 --> 13:32.770
I just wanted to give her
a special treat before I left.

13:32.780 --> 13:34.880
I thought we were gonna wait
until she was older.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.580
Did I have to
put <i> that</i> in writing, too?

13:36.580 --> 13:38.580
Can I sue him?
I want to sue him.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.520
You both have every right
to be upset with me.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.590
And maybe a few weeks
away from me will do some good.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.210
I'm just gonna
get a cab to the airport.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.620
Don't be crazy.
We'll drive you.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.050
No, I don't think I can handle

13:47.060 --> 13:48.930
(voice breaking)
a public emotional goodbye!

13:50.030 --> 13:51.600
Remember <i> her?</i>

13:59.370 --> 14:00.370
Damn it!

14:01.300 --> 14:02.560
Dad?

14:02.570 --> 14:04.230
Of course I have
the agendas, Claire.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.540
I was just...
trying to prove a point.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.540
I mean, what do you need
those things for, anyway?

14:08.540 --> 14:11.570
Agendas... they're crutches.
They're for the weak.

14:11.580 --> 14:14.420
You think the founding fathers
wrote down an <i> agenda?</i>

14:14.420 --> 14:15.550
Well, isn't
the Declaration of Inde...

14:15.550 --> 14:17.580
A leader leads, not reads.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.490
You go into that meeting
with a bunch of agendas,

14:19.490 --> 14:20.960
you're asking
for their approval.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.490
"Like me! Like me!
Like me!"

14:22.490 --> 14:24.590
I say "No"! How many times
have I told you...

14:24.590 --> 14:26.390
The first rule
of being a good boss is

14:26.400 --> 14:28.570
"You don't need your employees
to be your friends."

14:28.570 --> 14:30.790
You need them to respect you!

14:30.800 --> 14:32.130
Thank you.

14:32.130 --> 14:35.130
That is... exactly
what I needed to hear.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.270
I'm just doing my job.
Yeah.

14:36.270 --> 14:39.100
Just trust your gut, kid.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.410
Double-click...

14:40.410 --> 14:42.580
on... yourself.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.140
(sniffs)

14:46.150 --> 14:47.780
What smells so good?

14:47.780 --> 14:49.110
I'm making my favorite lasagna

14:49.120 --> 14:50.950
for my <i> own</i>
"Welcome Home" dinner.

14:50.950 --> 14:52.250
Uh-huh.
Can I ask you a question?

14:52.250 --> 14:53.780
What?
Do you think
it's possible

14:53.790 --> 14:55.920
that your brother snuck a girl
in here last night?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.350
I wouldn't be <i>too</i> surprised.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.530
So you think he's...
T-that they've been...

14:59.530 --> 15:02.700
Oh, come on, Dad.
Don't be so naive.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.130
We were all 17 once.

15:04.130 --> 15:05.890
It's not like we all...

15:17.010 --> 15:20.140
I sat there like that
for 20 minutes.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.720
And then
I got some <i> more</i> awful news.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.450
(door opens)

15:23.450 --> 15:25.510
I just got an e-mail saying
Family Camp was canceled...

15:25.520 --> 15:26.610
Not enough sign-ups.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.480
Ehh.
That's it?

15:28.490 --> 15:30.530
You don't care at all, do you?

15:30.530 --> 15:33.230
You're too busy running around
with that girl from last night!

15:33.230 --> 15:36.670
Yeah! That's right!
I know everything!

15:36.670 --> 15:38.200
How could you, Luke?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.640
To be honest,
I don't know why I was so upset.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.810
I knew I was <i> supposed</i> to be mad,
but I couldn't figure out why,

15:43.810 --> 15:46.010
so I just started saying
a bunch of stuff.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.180
Under my roof?!

15:47.180 --> 15:48.210
That was weird.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.250
In a bed that I paid for?!

15:50.250 --> 15:51.520
What does that
have to do with anything?

15:51.520 --> 15:53.210
With your grandfather watching?!

15:53.220 --> 15:54.220
What?

15:54.220 --> 15:55.480
But it wasn't half as crazy

15:55.480 --> 15:56.910
as what I really wanted to yell,

15:56.920 --> 15:59.590
which was
"Just stop growing up!"

15:59.590 --> 16:02.360
Look, I'm not sure everything
I said here makes sense,

16:02.360 --> 16:05.930
but... just be careful
and respectful.

16:05.930 --> 16:08.660
And you did break a big rule,

16:08.660 --> 16:11.590
so no car privileges
for a month.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.270
I don't need it anyway.

16:13.270 --> 16:14.510
I just got dumped.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.620
We sat there like that
for 20 minutes.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.940
Hi. How was
your first day at work?

16:27.950 --> 16:30.520
It was a little rough, but I
kind of stumbled into something.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.920
Aren't you
going to ask him, Mommy?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.050
What's he talking about?

16:34.060 --> 16:34.390
Nothing.

16:34.550 --> 16:37.320
I was going to ask you
to go to JuÃ¡rez with me

16:37.350 --> 16:39.010
next week
for my cousin's wedding,

16:39.010 --> 16:41.410
but I know that you don't want
to go, so I'll go alone.

16:41.420 --> 16:42.490
(sighs)
(chuckles)

16:44.120 --> 16:45.620
You're really not gonna go?

16:45.620 --> 16:48.050
Well, you heard her.
She's fine going alone.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.900
If that plane leaves the ground
and you're not with her,

16:50.900 --> 16:52.290
you'll regret it.

16:52.290 --> 16:55.120
Maybe not today
and maybe not tomorrow,

16:55.130 --> 16:57.600
but soon,
and for the rest of your life.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.570
What did you say?
Is that "Casablanca"?

16:59.570 --> 17:01.600
It doesn't take much to see

17:01.600 --> 17:04.030
the problems
of three little people

17:04.040 --> 17:06.980
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

17:06.980 --> 17:09.150
Someday, you'll understand that.

17:09.150 --> 17:10.200
Now, now.

17:10.210 --> 17:12.470
Here's looking at you, kid.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.220
Gloria!
About that wedding...

17:16.220 --> 17:18.060
I'm already booking the ticket!

17:18.060 --> 17:20.710
Okay, it's <i> growing!</i>

17:20.720 --> 17:22.550
I'm on hold
with the credit-card company.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.730
Oh! We should probably
try and figure out dinner.

17:24.730 --> 17:26.730
I have no idea
what we even have in the...

17:26.730 --> 17:28.500
Oh, my God.
Lily, look.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.330
Daddy made us all this food.

17:30.330 --> 17:32.660
"Heat for 20 minutes.
Love me for the rest of time."

17:32.670 --> 17:35.000
Aww.
"The sun will come out
tamales."

17:35.000 --> 17:36.500
(laughing)
Oh, my God.

17:36.510 --> 17:38.010
You think
he forgot about my curlers

17:38.010 --> 17:39.680
because he was too busy cooking?

17:39.680 --> 17:40.680
Maybe. I don't kn...

17:40.680 --> 17:42.680
Oh, yes. Hello?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.610
Oh. Oka... Okay.
Well, thank you.

17:44.610 --> 17:46.340
Um, Daddy bought a plane ticket

17:46.350 --> 17:48.320
to surprise us
on the 4th of July.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.490
That's why my credit card
was over the limit.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.690
Now I feel bad
for yelling at him.

17:52.690 --> 17:54.560
Yeah, me too.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.280
So, this is the end of the line.

17:57.290 --> 17:58.650
No. No!
I told you!

17:58.660 --> 18:00.660
You're gonna come visit,
I'll come there...

18:00.660 --> 18:02.790
No.
I meant security.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.870
Oh.

18:03.870 --> 18:05.800
So...
none of that messy stuff,

18:05.800 --> 18:08.760
because this is not
<i>goodbye</i> goodbye.

18:08.770 --> 18:11.210
Yeah. We'll leave the drama
to <i> those</i> two.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.510
(laughs nervously)

18:13.510 --> 18:15.780
"Promise me you won't
forget me, my darling.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.480
"I'll love you until this
pantsuit comes back in style."

18:18.480 --> 18:21.150
"I don't regret a single minute
I've spent with you."

18:21.150 --> 18:23.720
"I think you're the first man
I've ever loved."

18:25.720 --> 18:27.110
Not a single minute.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.380
(voice breaking)
You really are the first.

18:50.410 --> 18:52.240
Now, I had pigs and cows
when I was growing up...

18:52.250 --> 18:53.580
Cam!

18:53.580 --> 18:55.580
Oh, my gosh!
What are you guys doing here?

18:55.580 --> 18:58.550
We spent the whole day
thinking about ourselves,
and then realized...

18:58.550 --> 19:00.380
<i>you've</i> spent the whole day
thinking about us, too.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.590
So I brought you something
to take to Missouri.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.080
I'm coming with you, Daddy!

19:04.090 --> 19:06.090
Oh, my gosh! I get to keep her
for the whole summer?

19:06.090 --> 19:07.350
Yeah!
But won't you miss her?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.220
No. No.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.870
Because I'm coming, too!

19:09.870 --> 19:11.370
Ooh-ho-ho-ho!
My good...

19:11.370 --> 19:12.530
Well, what about work?

19:12.530 --> 19:13.860
I figure
I could work from there,

19:13.870 --> 19:15.600
and, you know,
fly back when I need to.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.000
Think I could use a summer
of smelling fresh biscuits...

19:18.010 --> 19:19.580
And, apparently, throwing them.

19:19.580 --> 19:21.680
Well, look who thinks he's gonna
qualify his first year.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.610
(chuckles)
We're gonna be Missourians!
Yeah.

19:23.610 --> 19:25.740
âªâª

19:27.780 --> 19:30.010
Claire: Sometimes,
you have one of those days

19:30.020 --> 19:31.720
where you are surrounded
by people

19:31.720 --> 19:33.920
but you still feel
pretty lonely.

19:37.460 --> 19:42.000
All you want to do is go home
to the comfort of your family.

19:46.540 --> 19:51.110
But sometimes, even your family
can't give you that comfort.

19:52.210 --> 19:57.110
Because it turns out they've all
had one of those days, too.

19:57.110 --> 20:01.240
All you can do is wait
for days like that to be over...

20:01.250 --> 20:02.950
so you can go to bed

20:02.950 --> 20:06.410
and hope you wake up
to a better tomorrow.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.050
Phil.

20:08.060 --> 20:10.430
Phil, I think I hear
something in Luke's room.

20:10.430 --> 20:12.160
Again?

20:15.330 --> 20:16.630
What?

20:16.630 --> 20:18.430
We know how much
you love Family Camp.

20:18.430 --> 20:20.890
But it was canceled,
and I thought you were
all kind of over it.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.160
We may be over it,
but we're not over <i> us.</i>

20:23.170 --> 20:25.600
What do you think
about Family Camp 2.0?

20:25.610 --> 20:28.340
Yeah, Phil, come on.
Cab's gonna be here any minute.

20:28.340 --> 20:29.670
Don't you have
some packing to do?

20:29.680 --> 20:31.310
Why are we always
waiting on you?

20:31.310 --> 20:33.270
I don't know
where I'm packing for,

20:33.280 --> 20:34.310
but I love this!

20:34.320 --> 20:35.750
(laughter)

20:35.750 --> 20:37.910
Phil: All right.
How good do these look?

20:37.920 --> 20:40.020
That's why they call them
"New York's finest."

20:40.020 --> 20:41.580
Yeah, who needs a campfire

20:41.590 --> 20:43.530
when we've got a metal box
full of gray water?

20:43.530 --> 20:45.100
Okay, everybody, picture.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.020
Uh, ma'am?
Would you mind?

20:47.030 --> 20:49.530
Um, uh, get in the back.
Get in the back. You're tall.
Okay. Okay.

20:49.530 --> 20:50.590
Okay.
All right.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.470
And...

20:52.470 --> 20:54.440
And now
we're down to <i> three</i> phones.

21:00.680 --> 21:01.950
(Beep)
Jay: Hey, boss. It's Dad.

21:01.950 --> 21:03.600
I know I just started back,

21:03.610 --> 21:05.610
but I'm taking a couple of days
off, if that's okay.

21:05.610 --> 21:07.640
And if not, too bad.
I'm in JuÃ¡rez!

21:07.650 --> 21:09.150
(Beep)
Hey, Dad. It's Mitch.

21:09.150 --> 21:10.540
Uh, I'm in Missouri with Cam.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.650
No, it's not
a hostage situation.

21:12.650 --> 21:14.980
Anyway, uh, can you swing by
our place and water our plants?

21:14.990 --> 21:16.560
Oh, and don't forget about
the Ficus in the bedroom.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.460
I know how much
you love to go in there.

21:18.460 --> 21:21.230
(Beep)
Claire: Hey!
It's your big sis, ya big sis.

21:21.230 --> 21:23.230
So, we all flew to New York
this morning.

21:23.230 --> 21:25.360
Thank God Dad came back to work.
He can cover for me.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.370
Anyway, listen, I think
I left the back door unlocked.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.900
Can you check?

21:28.900 --> 21:31.270
Phil: Come to New York!
The pretzels are huge!
