00:58.300 --> 01:00.067
WELCOME TO "TOSH.0."

01:00.067 --> 01:01.300
I GOT FLOW FROM MY HEAD TO MY

01:01.300 --> 01:10.500
UPPER CALF.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.500
>> TONIGHT I HANG WITH THIS

01:11.500 --> 01:12.533
PANICKED PERFORMANCE ARTIST.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.067
I LOOK AT DADDY LONG NECK'S

NOW, IS THIS GOING TO BE ON THE

01:21.400 --> 01:25.567
FINAL?

01:25.567 --> 01:26.600
JUMPIN' JEHOSEPHAT THAT'S A

01:26.600 --> 01:28.700
BEAUTIFUL CIRCLE.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.433
EITHER HE'S A WAR LOCK OR HIS

01:29.433 --> 01:34.200
DAD BANGED A COMPASS.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.200
IF HE CAN DRAW A PERFECT

01:38.200 --> 01:39.333
RHOMBUS, I'LL FOLLOW THAT MAN

01:39.333 --> 01:40.200
WHEREVER HE GOES.

01:40.200 --> 01:40.600
OH, YEAH.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.367
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE

01:41.367 --> 01:41.900
GENDERS SEPARATED.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.900
ASIANS GET TOO HORNY FOR MATH.

01:44.900 --> 01:49.533
NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, BUT

01:49.533 --> 01:50.267
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO TURN OUT A

01:50.267 --> 01:51.067
PRETTY FLAWLESS HEART FROM TIME

01:51.067 --> 02:00.567
TO TIME.

02:00.567 --> 02:01.633
WHY WERE THERE SO MANY ASIANS IN

02:01.633 --> 02:05.233
MY SHOWER?

02:05.233 --> 02:05.867
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

02:05.867 --> 02:07.900
I'M A HUMAN TRAFFICKER.

02:07.900 --> 02:08.667
MOVING ON, CHICK-FIL-A'S NEW AD

02:08.667 --> 02:17.733
CAMPAIGN MAKES ME QUEASY.

02:17.733 --> 02:19.300
SHE OBVIOUSLY HASN'T BEEN DOING

02:19.300 --> 02:23.433
HER PELVIC FLOOR EXERCISES.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.167
I'M NO DOCTOR, BUT ISN'T THAT

02:24.167 --> 02:27.067
HER BUTT HOLE?

02:27.067 --> 02:28.667
AND IF HE WEREN'T THERE TO

02:28.667 --> 02:30.200
DELIVER THE CALF, WOULD IT JUST

02:30.200 --> 02:31.767
GROW UP INSIDE THE COW?

02:31.767 --> 02:46.333
AGAIN, I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.867
HE'S READY TO BE BOXED UP FOR

02:47.867 --> 02:49.967
BLUE APRON.

02:49.967 --> 02:55.067
THAT'S FARM TO TABLE.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.133
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THAT

02:56.133 --> 02:58.433
HUSBAND STITCH TO GET THAT COW

02:58.433 --> 02:59.500

02:59.500 --> 03:01.933
IT'S A REAL THING.

03:01.933 --> 03:03.400
LOOK IT UP.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.600
THE HUSBAND STITCH, STILL WHAT

03:04.600 --> 03:06.400
THEY'RE CALLING IT IN 2018.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.167
LET'S WATCH IT AGAIN, SHALL WE?

03:07.167 --> 03:07.867
I'M SURE HE STERILIZED THAT

03:07.867 --> 03:09.133
TOE STRAP FIRST.

03:09.133 --> 03:10.167
TIE THAT TO A FORD F-150, YOU

03:10.167 --> 03:10.800
GOT YOURSELF AN ALABAMA

03:10.800 --> 03:13.800

WOULDN'T MIND THIS GUY COMING

03:16.233 --> 03:17.933
OVER TO MY HOUSE TO HELP ME WITH

03:17.933 --> 03:19.067
ONE OF MY STUBBORN BMs.

03:19.067 --> 03:21.200
ALL RIGHT.

03:21.200 --> 03:21.967
FLYING PRIVATE ISN'T ALWAYS SO

03:21.967 --> 03:31.067
GLAMOROUS.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.600
I KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING MY AGING

03:32.600 --> 03:33.200
BURDENSOME PARENTS FOR

03:33.200 --> 03:39.867

03:49.700 --> 03:50.267

03:50.267 --> 03:50.967
I'M SURE HE'LL BLAME THIS ON

03:50.967 --> 03:52.300
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SOMEHOW.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.867
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT REALLY

03:53.867 --> 03:56.467
HAPPENED, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT

03:56.467 --> 04:04.267
FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE.

04:04.267 --> 04:08.500
>> OH, I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.567
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR TIME.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.100
I'LL SEE YOU IN A YEAR OR TWO

04:12.100 --> 04:16.267

04:16.267 --> 04:18.333

04:18.333 --> 04:21.833

04:46.700 --> 04:48.500
MORE ENTERTAINING WHEN YOU PUT

04:48.500 --> 04:50.133
SMOOTH R&B OVER IT.

04:50.133 --> 04:50.900
AND WHEN IT'S A WOMAN DOING THE

04:50.900 --> 04:55.733
ABUSING.

SAVE SOME OF THIS ENERGY FOR

04:56.833 --> 04:59.133

05:03.833 --> 05:06.333
I HOPE THEY GET BACK TOGETHER

05:44.800 --> 05:50.267
HER MOTHER WAS A PELICAN.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.333
OH, THE GIRL WON!

05:51.333 --> 05:52.600
EVERYTHING IS BACKWARDS DOWN

05:52.600 --> 05:52.933

05:52.933 --> 05:53.633
THE FUTURE OF ALCOHOLISM IS

05:53.633 --> 05:57.967

CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,

07:56.500 --> 07:59.800
THERE'S A PUSSY STUCK IN A TREE.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.867
THE WRITER, DIRECTOR, AND

08:01.867 --> 08:03.800
SURVIVOR OF THAT IS HILDE.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.700
AND SHE HIT A SNAG WHEN SHE

08:06.700 --> 08:07.767
ALMOST LYNCHED HERSELF IN THE

08:07.767 --> 08:09.067
WOODS OF NORWAY.

08:09.067 --> 08:10.400
BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO DIE NAKED.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.400
I BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING MESSAGE

08:12.400 --> 08:13.733
OF HER ART FILM WAS THAT WOMEN

08:13.733 --> 08:16.500
HAVE WEAK ARMS.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.433
MY TAKE ON EXPERIMENTAL FILM IS

08:18.433 --> 08:20.333
THAT THE EXPERIMENT ALWAYS

08:20.333 --> 08:20.667
FAILS.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.133
IF A MOVIE NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED

08:22.133 --> 08:24.167
BY THE FILM MAKER AFTER IT'S

08:24.167 --> 08:25.967
OVER, IT'S NO LONGER A MOVIE.

08:25.967 --> 08:26.967
IT'S SCHOOL.

08:26.967 --> 08:27.900
MAYBE I DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR

08:27.900 --> 08:29.300
ART BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW

08:29.300 --> 08:30.333
TO TELL A STORY.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.633
NOW, GO PICK UP A COUPLE EXTRA

08:31.633 --> 08:33.533
SHIFTS AT THE COFFEE BEAN SO

08:33.533 --> 08:35.433
YOUR PARENTS CAN STOP PAYING

08:35.433 --> 08:36.733
YOUR CAR INSURANCE.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.200
SURE, I'VE ACCIDENTALLY WATCHED

08:38.200 --> 08:40.467
AN ART FLICK BEFORE BUT ONLY ON

08:40.467 --> 08:43.200
MY BURNER PORNOGRAPHY COMPUTER.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.167
I BLAME AUTOPLAY ON PORNHUB.

08:45.167 --> 08:47.267
BUT HILDE WAS JUST BARING HER

08:47.267 --> 08:48.500
SOUL AND HER HOLES.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.067
THAT'S WHY I FLEW HER TO AMERICA

10:38.967 --> 10:41.133
COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.467
OFFED ITSELF.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.967
>> IF YOU HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER

10:47.967 --> 10:49.733
AGAIN, WOULD YOU START SCREAMING

10:49.733 --> 10:50.267
HELP EARLIER?

10:50.267 --> 10:50.900
>> NO.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.033
I WOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.833
>> MAYBE YOU NEED TO WORK ON

10:54.833 --> 10:55.900
YOUR ANNUNCIATION.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.567
HELP SOUNDED LIKE HALP.

10:57.567 --> 10:58.267
>> HELP!

10:58.267 --> 11:00.867
>> I'M TRYING TO PROJECT AS MUCH

11:00.867 --> 11:01.733
AS POSSIBLE.

11:01.733 --> 11:03.300
SO PRONUNCIATION IS NOT ON THE

11:03.300 --> 11:04.200
TOP OF MY LIST.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.233
>> I THINK THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.

11:05.233 --> 11:08.400
I THINK SO MANY PEOPLE HEARD

11:08.400 --> 11:09.267
HALP AND THEY WERE LIKE, OH,

11:09.267 --> 11:11.567
THAT PERSON DOESN'T NEED HELP.

11:11.567 --> 11:15.100
THEY NEED HALP.

11:15.100 --> 11:15.867
WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.200
WAS THERE A LESSON LEARNED?

11:17.200 --> 11:20.267
>> ALWAYS HIDE A, LIKE, KNIFE IN

11:20.267 --> 11:20.900
YOUR BUTT CRACK.

11:20.900 --> 11:21.567
>> OKAY.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.433
THAT SEEMS LIKE HORRIBLE ADVICE.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.633
WHO CAME TO RESCUE YOU?

11:24.633 --> 11:25.967
>> GINTA.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.300
>> GINTA?

11:27.300 --> 11:30.267
I NEED A GINTA IN MY LIFE.

11:30.267 --> 11:31.867
HOW DID SHE GET YOU DOWN?

11:31.867 --> 11:33.467
>> BY AVERTING HER EYES.

11:33.467 --> 11:36.133
>> WHY WAS SHE ASHAMED OF YOUR

11:36.133 --> 11:36.467
BODY?

11:36.467 --> 11:39.833
>> IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN YOUR

11:39.833 --> 11:40.433
VAGINA'S HEAD HEIGHT.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.833
>> IT WAS AS BAD OF A POSITION

11:41.833 --> 11:44.800
AS YOU CAN BE FOR A VAGINA.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.067
WAS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME NUDE ON

11:48.067 --> 11:48.433
CAMERA?

11:48.433 --> 11:48.767
>> NO.

11:48.767 --> 11:49.633
>> THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

11:49.633 --> 11:51.700
WHAT OTHER WORKS WERE YOU JUST

11:51.700 --> 11:53.167
IF SOMEONE WERE TO WANT TO LOOK

11:53.167 --> 11:53.533
THAT UP?

11:53.533 --> 11:53.800
NO?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.133
OKAY.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.900
>> NO.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.900
>> WHAT KIND OF KNOT WAS THAT?

11:58.900 --> 11:59.833
>> A NOOSE KNOT.

11:59.833 --> 12:01.267
>> IT WAS A NOOSE?

12:01.267 --> 12:03.733
WHO KNOWS HOW TO TIE A NOOSE?

12:03.733 --> 12:04.233
>> I DON'T KNOW.

12:04.233 --> 12:06.633
SOMEONE WITH A SLIGHT MORBID

12:06.633 --> 12:07.433
CURIOSITY.

12:07.433 --> 12:11.933
>> NOW, IF YOU WERE TO EVER OFF

12:11.933 --> 12:13.600
YOURSELF, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

12:13.600 --> 12:14.167
HOW YOU WOULD DO IT?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.433
>> I WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF

12:16.433 --> 12:17.333
ELABORATE GAS CHAMBER.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.200
>> HUH.

12:18.200 --> 12:18.967
I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU HAD THAT

12:18.967 --> 12:23.200
ANSWER READY.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.400
WERE YOUR PARENTS DISAPPOINTED

12:25.400 --> 12:26.533
WHEN YOU TOLD THEM YOU WANTED TO

12:26.533 --> 12:27.133
BE AN ARTIST?

12:27.133 --> 12:27.800
>> NO.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.667
>> HUH.

12:28.667 --> 12:29.800
>> THEY'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.667
>> THAT'S NOT GOOD.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.233
THAT DOES NOT CREATE A GOOD

12:32.233 --> 12:32.600
ARTIST.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.567
WHAT'S YOUR LEAST FAVORITE TYPE

12:33.567 --> 12:34.133
OF ART?

12:34.133 --> 12:35.333
>> NOPE, NOPE.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.467
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT.

12:36.467 --> 12:38.933
>> THERE'S NOTHING THAT UPSETS

12:38.933 --> 12:39.233
YOU?

12:39.233 --> 12:40.433
LIKE I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

12:40.433 --> 12:40.833
>> NO.

12:40.833 --> 12:41.433
THEN I WOULD BE GOOD.

12:41.433 --> 12:41.800
>> OKAY.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.767
ALL RIGHT.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.100
YOU REALLY ARE AN ARTIST.

12:45.100 --> 12:48.067
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE WORK

12:48.067 --> 12:48.533
OF SHIA LaBEOUF?

12:48.533 --> 12:50.867
>> YES.

12:50.867 --> 12:51.467
>> SNAP LEG.

12:51.467 --> 12:52.100
SNAP LEG.

12:52.100 --> 12:52.867
SNAP LEG.

12:52.867 --> 12:53.667
SNAP LEG.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.167
SNAP LEG.

12:55.167 --> 12:56.133
>> IS THAT PERFORMANCE ART?

12:56.133 --> 12:57.567
>> YEAH, I WOULD SAY SO.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.900
>> HE'S A CROCK OF SHIT.

13:00.900 --> 13:05.567
DID THIS RUIN BONDAGE FOR YOU?

13:05.567 --> 13:06.633
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE

13:06.633 --> 13:09.700
DESCRIBING YOUR WORK AS PART

13:09.700 --> 13:10.633
PINATA, PART SNUFF FILM?

13:10.633 --> 13:12.833
>> DAMN, THAT MAKES ME SOUND

13:12.833 --> 13:13.467
CUTE, DOESN'T IT?

13:13.467 --> 13:14.167
>> I DON'T KNOW.

13:14.167 --> 13:14.967
SEEMS TRAGIC.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.800
>> I'VE HEARD OF A THING CALLED

13:16.800 --> 13:18.633
PORN AND I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO

13:18.633 --> 13:19.333
BE A WOMAN.

13:19.333 --> 13:19.833
>> YEAH?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.100
>> YEAH.

13:22.100 --> 13:22.667
I GOT DEATH THREATS.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.200
>> FROM WHO?

13:24.200 --> 13:24.700
>> I DON'T KNOW.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.400
SOME CLOSETED CONSERVATIVE PERV.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.533
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT TREE?

13:27.533 --> 13:28.800
>> I'VE GOT SOME HERE FOR YOU.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.300
YOU KNOW.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.067
AFTER WHAT IT DID TO ME, I

13:33.067 --> 13:34.067
THOUGHT I'D RETURN THE FAVOR.

13:34.067 --> 13:35.333
>> SO YOU MURDERED A TREE?

13:35.333 --> 13:35.833
>> YES.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.067
>> IS THIS THE ONLY PIECE YOU

13:37.067 --> 13:37.400
HAVE?

13:37.400 --> 13:37.900
>> NO.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.367
I HAVE OTHER PIECES THAT ARE

13:39.367 --> 13:42.767
MADE INTO BOXES TO CONTAIN THE

13:42.767 --> 13:44.600
USB STICK THAT HOLD THE FILM.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.167
>> HUH.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.100
WHAT ABOUT COASTERS?

13:46.100 --> 13:47.067
>> YEAH, NO.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.200
>> YOU SHOULD MAKE COASTERS.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.067
WHICH ONE'S WORSE?

13:50.067 --> 13:52.433
THE ROPE BURN ON YOUR ANKLE OR

13:52.433 --> 13:55.300
THE SUNBURN ON YOUR LADY PART?

13:55.300 --> 13:56.867
>> THERE'S NO SUN IN NORWAY.

13:56.867 --> 13:58.800
>> IT SEEMED LIKE A BEAUTIFUL

13:58.800 --> 13:59.100
DAY.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.300
>> IT WAS SURPRISINGLY FOR

14:00.300 --> 14:00.667
EASTER.

14:00.667 --> 14:01.433
>> OH, REALLY?

14:01.433 --> 14:03.500
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID ON EASTER

14:03.500 --> 14:03.967
SUNDAY?

14:03.967 --> 14:04.933
>> I DON'T KNOW.

14:04.933 --> 14:05.733
I'M NOT CHRISTIAN.

14:05.733 --> 14:07.300
>> I KNOW YOU'RE NOT CHRISTIAN.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.667
I SAW YOU HANGING UPSIDE DOWN

14:09.667 --> 14:10.067
NAKED.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.333
>> JESUS WAS CHRISTIAN.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.333
WHAT DID HE DO?

14:12.333 --> 14:14.067
>> HE DID HANG FROM A TREE,

14:14.067 --> 14:14.433
CORRECT.

14:14.433 --> 14:14.933
ONE TIME.

14:14.933 --> 14:18.133
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE.

14:18.133 --> 14:22.167
ENOUGH CHITCHAT HILDE.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.367
IT'S A COMPLEX EXAMINATION OF

16:16.367 --> 16:17.167
HUMAN SUFFERING.

16:17.167 --> 16:18.233
THAT'S RIGHT.
