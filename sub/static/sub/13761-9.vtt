00:04.139 --> 00:07.992
<i>I can't believe we
found a Kyber Saber crystal here</i>

00:07.993 --> 00:11.845
on Takodana. Naare didn't
even know there was one here.

00:11.847 --> 00:15.082
And with any luck, she never will.

00:16.751 --> 00:19.186
- Fire it up, Roger.
- Roger, roger.

00:21.122 --> 00:25.159
Ha! Purring like a nexu.
We're good to go.

00:25.161 --> 00:28.875
Some things are finally going right.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.998
Whoa!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.067
But we still got plenty wrong!

00:35.036 --> 00:38.005
<i>It's Naare!
How'd she find us?</i>

00:44.046 --> 00:45.846
Naare got the crystal!

00:49.951 --> 00:53.220
- Come on!
- Roger! Get us in the air!

01:11.873 --> 01:14.153
Punch in the coordinates for
the leap to hyperspace!

01:14.237 --> 01:17.911
- Where to?
- Anywhere but here.

01:22.984 --> 01:24.885
<i>Well, they're gone!</i>

01:24.887 --> 01:28.088
But they're not out of reach.

01:28.665 --> 01:31.416
<b>1x09 - The Kyber Saber Crystal Chase</b>

01:37.132 --> 01:40.901
How did Naare find us?
That planet wasn't on her map.

01:40.903 --> 01:43.170
The crystal was supposed to be on Rodia.

01:43.172 --> 01:46.273
Did she put a tracking
device on our ship?

01:48.042 --> 01:49.443
Nah. I don't think so.

01:49.444 --> 01:52.246
But she's obviously
working with Graballa now.

01:52.248 --> 01:54.915
Somebody on Takodana
might have recognized us.

01:54.917 --> 01:58.252
The real problem is
I just lost another crystal to Naare.

01:58.254 --> 02:01.288
I'm doing a terrible
job of saving the galaxy.

02:01.290 --> 02:04.892
Well, the Kyber Saber can't
function without all its parts.

02:04.894 --> 02:06.360
It needs every crystal.

02:06.362 --> 02:10.130
Yeah, and thanks to me,
Naare's got most of 'em.

02:10.132 --> 02:12.933
Most... but not all.

02:12.935 --> 02:15.503
If we can just get
one crystal, she can't

02:15.504 --> 02:18.071
assemble the Kyber Saber.
And we win!

02:18.073 --> 02:21.074
And no one's better at
finding crystals than this guy.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.113
There's one on Ningoth.

02:26.115 --> 02:28.148
<i>Water planet.
Bad for battle droids.</i>

02:28.150 --> 02:31.285
- One on Hoth.
- Ice planet. Worse for battle droids.

02:31.287 --> 02:35.923
- And one on Naboo.
- The battle droid graveyard? Seriously?!

02:35.925 --> 02:39.304
- So, where do we go first?
- Uh, who votes

02:39.339 --> 02:43.096
for none of the above?
Let's see. Um, one hand.

02:43.098 --> 02:45.165
Anybody else?

02:45.167 --> 02:48.987
- Mmm, Naboo's the closest.
- And the easiest.

02:49.022 --> 02:51.071
Naare will expect us to go there first.

02:51.073 --> 02:54.942
So, we're going all the way to Ningoth.

02:54.944 --> 02:58.545
Fine, but if I rust,
it's on your heads.

03:03.438 --> 03:05.439
Okay, okay.

03:05.441 --> 03:12.079
I give you my newest creation,
the ultra high-tech Z-Sub!

03:12.081 --> 03:14.114
- Aw!
- It's so cute!

03:14.116 --> 03:19.386
- What? It's not cute. It's rugged!
- It's adorable.

03:19.388 --> 03:22.122
<i>It's even got a smiley face.</i>

03:22.124 --> 03:24.291
Okay, that's a tactical
underwater geomapper.

03:24.293 --> 03:26.560
I just wanna tickle its chin.

03:26.562 --> 03:31.792
- Who's a sweet widdle submareen?
- That is not a chin.

03:31.827 --> 03:34.334
It's a pressure-resistant
hull, watertight to...

03:34.336 --> 03:38.305
- I'm gonna call it the Bubbly Subbly.
- Aw! "Bubbly Subbly."

03:38.307 --> 03:40.407
Come here, little Bubbly Subbly.

03:40.409 --> 03:44.144
It is not cute, and you
are not calling it that!

03:44.146 --> 03:46.171
<i>We're here!</i>

03:56.157 --> 03:59.159
I feel the crystal below us somewhere.

03:59.161 --> 04:01.361
All right. Everybody
into the Bubbly Subbly.

04:01.363 --> 04:04.364
Ha!
You called it the Bubbly Subbly.

04:04.366 --> 04:07.501
It is kinda cute.

04:09.270 --> 04:11.338
Let's do it.

04:13.141 --> 04:16.576
Good luck! No way I
would get into that thing.

04:37.298 --> 04:39.433
Okay, Rowan, take us to the crystal.

04:41.869 --> 04:43.370
It's to the left.

04:44.238 --> 04:46.473
<i>No. Right!</i>

04:46.475 --> 04:49.242
<i>No, it's left.
Right.</i>

04:49.244 --> 04:52.312
<i>No, no, more... more right.</i>

04:52.314 --> 04:54.314
<i>Upside down!</i>

04:54.316 --> 04:56.516
<i>Now go up. Down.</i>

04:56.518 --> 04:58.552
<i>More down. Up again.</i>

04:58.554 --> 05:01.188
<i>Up! Do a barrel roll!</i>

05:01.190 --> 05:03.390
Rowan!
You're all over the place.

05:03.392 --> 05:07.194
Yeah, I'd like to find the
crystal before I lose my lunch.

05:07.196 --> 05:09.563
- Sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.

05:09.565 --> 05:13.667
Just take a deep breath and focus.

05:17.516 --> 05:19.416
It's over there.

05:23.221 --> 05:26.289
- Yes!  - See? You just had
to let it come to you.

05:26.291 --> 05:30.460
It is coming to us.
Fast!

05:30.462 --> 05:32.362
Fish!

05:33.297 --> 05:36.272
<i> Look out!</i>

05:40.339 --> 05:43.340
Wh-Where are you going?
We gotta get the crystal from that fish!

05:43.342 --> 05:47.110
<i>If we stay here, the
only thing we're getting is eaten.</i>

05:51.249 --> 05:54.284
<i>- Yes!
- I can't see anything!</i>

06:01.326 --> 06:03.393
Oh. Oh.

06:05.529 --> 06:08.431
Wait!
It's going after the other fish.

06:08.433 --> 06:11.434
It must use light as bait.

06:11.436 --> 06:14.404
Our spotlight was
drawing away his lunch.

06:14.406 --> 06:17.340
Maybe we could trade him our
spotlight for the crystal?

06:17.342 --> 06:20.712
Great idea, except our
spotlight's broken now.

06:25.283 --> 06:28.251
<i>I can fix this.</i>

06:28.253 --> 06:30.525
<i>Rowan, you did it!</i>

06:31.223 --> 06:36.126
All right, fish, let's make a trade.

06:36.128 --> 06:37.460
Easy now.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.530
Nice fish! Nice fish!

06:44.568 --> 06:47.304
- Got it!
- Yes! We did it!

06:47.306 --> 06:50.340
We got the Kyber Saber crystal!

06:56.564 --> 06:59.099
All right, Roger. Hoist us up.

06:59.101 --> 07:02.169
Hey, you actually made
it back. Good for you.

07:06.107 --> 07:09.009
<i>We got our one crystal.</i>

07:09.011 --> 07:10.977
Now Naare won't be able to...

07:10.979 --> 07:13.013
- Whoa!
- What was that?

07:13.015 --> 07:15.282
<i>How'd she find us? Again!</i>

07:15.284 --> 07:17.350
<i>I told you we
should've gone to Hoth.</i>

07:17.352 --> 07:20.320
<i>You did not!</i>

07:25.026 --> 07:28.295
She's hooked on to us!
Roger, get us out of here!

07:28.297 --> 07:31.031
<i>Right now I got my own problems.</i>

07:31.033 --> 07:33.233
Battle stations!

07:38.206 --> 07:41.007
Roger! You're supposed
to be pulling us in.

07:41.009 --> 07:43.176
Never mind that. Release the cable!
Release the cable!

07:43.178 --> 07:46.446
- Roger, roger!
- No! No!

07:47.448 --> 07:50.116
Oh, yes, yes!

07:56.324 --> 07:58.391
Yeah!

07:58.393 --> 08:01.061
<i>- Roger, come pick us up.
- Hang on!</i>

08:01.063 --> 08:04.130
<i>I gotta get the tow cable ready.</i>

08:04.132 --> 08:07.033
<i>- Yes!
- No time. Just open the scoop.</i>

08:07.035 --> 08:11.371
- But how are we going to get in without the tow cable?
- Leave that to me.

08:17.411 --> 08:19.346
The crystal!

08:19.348 --> 08:22.382
- Got it!
- Close the scoop.

08:27.221 --> 08:29.256
What? No!

08:29.258 --> 08:32.392
Not again.

08:32.394 --> 08:34.427
No! Stop!

08:34.429 --> 08:39.164
- No...
- Sorry, Rowan. We gotta go.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.791
- Activate the hyperdrive.
- You want me to launch

08:41.826 --> 08:44.337
into hyperspace on the
surface of a planet?

08:44.339 --> 08:46.406
Just do it!

08:58.387 --> 09:03.223
How many times is Naare going to
take a crystal right out of my hands?

09:03.225 --> 09:05.425
I just want to know
how she found us again.

09:05.427 --> 09:08.361
It's like she knows where we're
going even before we get there.

09:08.363 --> 09:10.381
It didn't help that we went to a planet

09:10.382 --> 09:12.399
where we're the only
thing on the surface.

09:12.401 --> 09:14.467
- It made us easy to spot.
- See that, Rowan?

09:14.469 --> 09:17.137
You're not the only one
who's terrible at this.

09:17.139 --> 09:21.308
You always know
just what to say, Roger.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.243
I know. It's a gift.

09:23.245 --> 09:25.412
<i>So, seawater in the engines.</i>

09:25.414 --> 09:28.415
Whew!
That is not gonna be cheap to fix.

09:28.417 --> 09:32.485
So is that one that you pay for,
or we... we split or what?

09:32.487 --> 09:36.389
I am not concerned
with such trivialities.

09:36.391 --> 09:39.092
Oh, who is?
Neither am... I'm not!

09:39.094 --> 09:42.329
It's just, you know, this... this
operation's getting a little pricey.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.431
I can't help notice
that so far, you know,

09:44.433 --> 09:46.399
<i>you're just bringing you to the table,</i>

09:46.401 --> 09:49.436
whereas me, you know,
I got men and I got ships,

09:49.438 --> 09:52.305
I got a food bill longer than my tail.

09:52.307 --> 09:54.994
Graballa, relax.
We got the crystal,

09:55.029 --> 09:58.445
and those trash pickers
actually think they escaped.

09:58.447 --> 10:01.581
Everything is proceeding as planned.

10:01.583 --> 10:05.352
Your plan, lady.
But I got my own plan.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.469
I got... Dengar!

10:10.458 --> 10:13.159
Oh! Were we doing that now?

10:13.161 --> 10:17.906
- Yes, Dengar, we were doing that now.
- Okay. Sorry, sorry.

10:17.941 --> 10:19.466
Close the door.
Do it again! Do it again!

10:19.468 --> 10:21.534
Nope. The moment is gone.

10:21.536 --> 10:24.204
<i>- I'm ready.
- It's gone!</i>

10:33.381 --> 10:35.281
Naboo.

10:35.283 --> 10:38.284
There's enough people here.
We'll be harder to spot.

10:39.353 --> 10:43.390
I'm sensing... the crystal.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.192
It's over there, in that old palace.

10:46.194 --> 10:49.629
Um, I don't think
that's a palace anymore.

10:51.532 --> 10:54.501
<i>Drop your credits into the donation box,</i>

10:54.503 --> 10:58.512
<i>and your journey into my
museum will be complete!</i>

10:58.547 --> 11:00.473
<i>...and your journey into my museum...</i>

11:00.475 --> 11:02.342
Excuse me. Out of the way.

11:02.344 --> 11:04.411
Palpatine's number-one
fan coming through!

11:04.413 --> 11:07.615
I'd like the super-deluxe VIP tour,
please, unless there's anything

11:07.693 --> 11:11.072
fancier than that, in which case,
I would like something fancier.

11:15.086 --> 11:18.255
"The Palpatine Museum"?

11:18.257 --> 11:24.261
There's a Kyber Saber crystal
in the Emperor's own museum.

11:27.598 --> 11:29.366
So what do we do now?

11:29.367 --> 11:32.903
It's not like we can go poking
around exhibits in broad daylight.

11:32.905 --> 11:35.839
The crystal's in there. I can feel it.

11:35.841 --> 11:38.074
- We can't leave without it.
- We won't.

11:38.076 --> 11:40.677
I know how we'll get into the museum.

11:40.679 --> 11:42.712
And, Roger, you're the key to my plan.

11:42.714 --> 11:47.017
Naturally! I was a master of
disguise during the Clone Wars.

11:47.019 --> 11:51.021
Ha! Where's Roger?
Where'd I go?

11:51.023 --> 11:55.058
Reach for the sky, clone scum!
Pew, pew, pew!

11:55.060 --> 11:58.128
Uh, that never actually worked, did it?

11:58.130 --> 12:03.800
- Not even in training camp.
- Don't worry. My plan is better.

12:03.802 --> 12:05.168
Trust me.

12:08.539 --> 12:11.608
Got a delivery of one gen-u-ine
Clone Wars battle droid

12:11.610 --> 12:13.944
for your gen-u-ine
Clone Wars exhibit.

12:16.714 --> 12:18.915
<i>Drop your credits into the donation...</i>

12:21.619 --> 12:24.554
Sure you don't want the mustache?

12:24.556 --> 12:26.790
Yes! I mean, who even
knows me here on Naboo?

12:26.792 --> 12:29.926
<i>General Durpin!</i>

12:29.928 --> 12:32.929
All zones are safeguarded,
shielded and secured.

12:32.931 --> 12:35.799
Would you relax,
Commander Plumestriker?

12:35.801 --> 12:40.637
Who's gonna be stupid enough to
break into the Emperor's own museum?

12:40.639 --> 12:43.974
No one, General Durpin.
No one could be that stupid.

12:43.976 --> 12:48.812
Correct! The levels of stupidity
required are incalculable.

12:48.814 --> 12:50.914
What do you got there, son?

12:50.916 --> 12:53.617
D-D-Delivery?

12:55.820 --> 12:59.556
The Clone Wars exhibit is
two halls down, on the right.

12:59.558 --> 13:01.619
You can't miss it.
You'll bump right into it.

13:01.620 --> 13:02.993
Come along, Plumestriker.

13:02.995 --> 13:06.830
<i>I wanna get a head start
on our dead-end jobs.</i>

13:07.932 --> 13:11.902
- See? Mustache, right?
- Zip it!

13:25.750 --> 13:30.587
Sir, this crushing
boredom forces me to ask:

13:30.589 --> 13:34.691
- What is it we do here?
- We survive.

13:34.693 --> 13:37.861
Listen, it was a close call
when we got promoted on Kashyyyk.

13:37.863 --> 13:39.397
But, lucky for us,

13:39.398 --> 13:44.000
I got us this prime gig
where nothing ever happens!

13:58.983 --> 14:01.885
- Sir, did you hear that?
- That smash of breaking glass?

14:01.887 --> 14:03.820
No, I did not.

14:03.822 --> 14:07.891
- What if it was a burglar?
- Impossible. Your move.

14:07.893 --> 14:10.760
That's an order.

14:13.998 --> 14:15.866
- Yes!
- Good job, Roger!

14:15.868 --> 14:20.637
Ugh.
Rich people and their palaces.

14:20.639 --> 14:22.739
Why does anyone need so much stuff?

14:22.741 --> 14:26.910
Ah! Guys! These souvenir
Palpatine voice changers!

14:26.912 --> 14:29.045
They're half off!

14:29.547 --> 14:34.079
<i>Ooh, I sound so creepy!</i>

14:34.814 --> 14:38.688
You know that's the guy who's
oppressing the entire galaxy, right?

14:38.690 --> 14:41.992
And on a personal note, he
wants to cut us all to shreds.

14:42.860 --> 14:45.061
<i>Can I at least get a mug?</i>

14:45.063 --> 14:49.065
We need this crystal, so stay focused!

14:49.067 --> 14:50.934
- Got it.
- Focused.

14:50.936 --> 14:54.037
On it. Nothing's gonna break my...

14:54.039 --> 14:57.107
Hey!
That's my old buddy RO-HK!

14:57.109 --> 15:01.011
<i>RO-HK!
Remember me? RO-GR.</i>

15:01.013 --> 15:04.014
Forget him. We stay on the hunt.

15:04.016 --> 15:07.951
I am on this like a...
Classic starfighters!

15:07.953 --> 15:11.955
Is that a... N-1?

15:13.124 --> 15:15.058
Okay, okay! Just give me a...

15:15.060 --> 15:18.695
It won't be like last time.
I-I-I'll just be right back.

15:20.097 --> 15:22.966
Don't worry. I'm focused.

15:22.968 --> 15:26.169
Nothing is going to
distract me, not even...

15:27.805 --> 15:30.073
Queen Amidala gowns!
They're...

15:30.075 --> 15:34.077
They're... gorgeous!

15:34.079 --> 15:37.047
Fine. I'll just focus for myself.

15:37.049 --> 15:39.916
Not really my strength, I know, but...

15:39.918 --> 15:41.885
Ooh, a floor buffer!

15:41.887 --> 15:44.888
Oh, yeah!

15:45.923 --> 15:48.557
No! Focus!

15:53.625 --> 15:57.100
I can do this.
I can find the crystal.

15:57.102 --> 16:00.136
I can stay calm and collected

16:00.138 --> 16:05.075
in this dark, creepy museum
dedicated

16:05.077 --> 16:09.079
to the most evil man in the galaxy.

16:12.149 --> 16:14.017
<i>- Sorry!
- Gaah!</i>

16:14.019 --> 16:17.187
<i>I'm afraid you'll find this
restroom is not quite operational!</i>

16:26.097 --> 16:32.202
Yeah, I'm pretty much the brains
of the whole salvage operat... Oh!

16:37.174 --> 16:38.908
Whoa!

16:42.179 --> 16:45.949
- What was that?!
- What? What? That extremely loud explosion?

16:45.951 --> 16:48.184
Nothing. Move.

16:51.056 --> 16:52.789
High alert. Move out!

16:55.726 --> 16:57.961
Wrong move.

16:57.963 --> 17:00.030
What are you nerf herders doing?

17:01.165 --> 17:03.033
- Whoa.
- What?

17:03.035 --> 17:06.970
- I can't like nice things?
- Uh, we... we gotta get outta here!

17:06.972 --> 17:10.205
- Where's Rowan?
- Hold it right there!

17:10.208 --> 17:13.977
Oh, great! Burglars.
We turn 'em in, I'm a hero.

17:13.979 --> 17:16.179
I get a commendation,
a promotion and then a parade.

17:16.181 --> 17:21.751
Look, Plumestriker, do me a favor.
They're just mischievous kids.

17:21.752 --> 17:23.819
Save the paperwork.
Let 'em go.

17:23.821 --> 17:26.857
- Something's familiar about them.
- What?

17:26.892 --> 17:28.758
- You remember us from Kashyyyk?
- Shh!

17:28.760 --> 17:31.027
Who said anything about Kashyyyk?

17:31.029 --> 17:34.030
Oh! Not me.
I've never been there myself.

17:34.032 --> 17:37.934
That's who you are!
The kids from Kashyyyk!

17:37.936 --> 17:41.004
You will answer for your crimes!

17:41.006 --> 17:47.437
But in deference to General Durpin,
we'll skip the paperwork.

17:49.513 --> 17:52.048
Ready.
Aim.

17:52.050 --> 17:54.017
<i>- Fire!
- You there!</i>

17:54.019 --> 17:56.853
<i>What are you doing?</i>

17:56.855 --> 17:58.888
<i>These are generous donors.</i>

17:58.890 --> 18:02.926
<i>Leave them be, or feel my wrath!</i>

18:02.928 --> 18:07.063
Uh, Your Lordship, I take full
responsibility for this mix-up.

18:07.065 --> 18:11.901
I insist on being demoted to ensign.

18:11.903 --> 18:15.305
<i>It is done.
Now be gone!</i>

18:17.074 --> 18:19.868
Ensign. Yes!

18:21.112 --> 18:23.888
Gotta go.
Thanks for the save, and, uh...

18:24.915 --> 18:26.916
- Rowan!
- You scared us!

18:26.918 --> 18:28.318
Where did you get the cloak?

18:28.320 --> 18:33.256
<i>I'm afraid you'll find this
restroom is not quite operational.</i>

18:33.258 --> 18:35.091
That was some quick thinking, Rowan.

18:35.093 --> 18:38.128
Now let's not push our luck. We
gotta get out of here before...

18:38.130 --> 18:40.930
No. I'm not leaving without the crystal.

18:40.932 --> 18:44.234
What? But it could be
anywhere in this museum!

18:44.236 --> 18:48.238
Or it could be right here in this room.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.075
- Where?
- Here!

18:52.077 --> 18:57.013
Huh. It just came to you.
Like I said all along.

18:57.015 --> 19:00.083
<i>And now it's come to me!</i>

19:00.085 --> 19:03.948
Hey!
That looked great on me!

19:12.096 --> 19:14.881
Roger, this is a museum!
That's not gonna...

19:15.166 --> 19:20.003
Seriously?
They have working blasters on display?

19:20.005 --> 19:23.657
They got a lot of confidence
in that velvet rope.

19:26.343 --> 19:31.411
- I'll take that crystal now.
- No! Not again!

19:31.446 --> 19:34.217
I mean, I know I said that
last time, but still...

19:34.219 --> 19:38.161
not again!

19:38.355 --> 19:42.058
Your powers are no match for me.

19:46.197 --> 19:48.898
You're not taking that crystal.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.001
If that's the way you want it.

19:59.877 --> 20:02.045
Oops.

20:06.951 --> 20:10.653
I'm going to take this.
It's more my color.

20:19.830 --> 20:22.034
Eat mug!

20:23.204 --> 20:25.497
And now I'm out of ammo.

20:28.005 --> 20:29.772
RO-HK!

20:29.774 --> 20:32.008
You will pay for deactivating

20:32.010 --> 20:35.778
my already deactivated friend!

20:42.551 --> 20:43.883
Oh, Rowan.

20:43.885 --> 20:46.920
With me, you could have
reached your destiny!

20:48.756 --> 20:51.624
I'm going to reach for something else.

20:53.694 --> 20:55.528
Huh?

21:01.902 --> 21:03.970
This is more my color.

21:06.541 --> 21:09.876
- We gotta go!
- What about the crystal?

21:09.878 --> 21:12.645
We'll get the next one.
This place is gonna collapse!

21:17.485 --> 21:21.888
So long, RO-HK!
I'll never forget you!

21:21.890 --> 21:24.668
Unless I get my memory wiped.

21:28.729 --> 21:31.931
<i>So, when you
said you had a master plan,</i>

21:31.933 --> 21:35.452
I'm assuming getting an entire
museum dropped on you

21:35.453 --> 21:38.972
- was also part of it?
- The plan was to get this at any cost!

21:38.974 --> 21:42.008
Oh, maybe you could
tell that to the Emperor

21:42.010 --> 21:45.845
when he sees
what you did to his museum.

21:45.847 --> 21:49.816
Everyone relax!
This is only a drill.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.126
- How does she keep finding us?
- It can't be a coincidence.

21:58.161 --> 22:00.492
It's like we're transmitting our
every move to her.

22:00.578 --> 22:04.030
But we're not! We're not
transmitting anything to anybody.

22:04.032 --> 22:07.800
Oh.
You guys aren't.

22:07.802 --> 22:11.004
But this thing has been on
since Tatooine.

22:11.006 --> 22:14.607
<i>Do you think that's how
they're following us?</i>

22:14.609 --> 22:17.810
They're onto us. What
are we gonna do now?

22:17.812 --> 22:21.714
Nothing. We don't need
to follow them anymore.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.816
There's only one crystal left.

22:23.818 --> 22:27.086
And it's on the ice planet Hoth.
