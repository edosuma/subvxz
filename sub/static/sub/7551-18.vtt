[Elevator bell dings]

00:22.587 --> 00:24.227
Okay, that was interminable.

00:24.261 --> 00:26.528
How are 15
powerpoint presentations

00:26.563 --> 00:28.697
a "unique research opportunity"?

00:28.732 --> 00:31.700
You guys said crime-stat
briefings were "fascinating."

00:31.735 --> 00:33.802
Wait a minute.
You guys told him that?

00:33.836 --> 00:36.037
Well, I'm... I'm sure
they're fascinating to someone.

00:36.072 --> 00:38.751
Oh, my... you lied to me.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.785
I just squandered
three hours of my life.

00:41.805 --> 00:43.145
So did we.

00:43.179 --> 00:45.259
Oh, come on, Castle.
No hard feelings.

00:45.279 --> 00:48.116
I'll tell you what...
I will buy the first round

00:48.151 --> 00:49.317
- at the Old Haunt.
- Sorry, guys.

00:49.351 --> 00:50.451
I can't tonight.

00:50.486 --> 00:52.721
I have another security gig
with my brother-in-law.

00:52.741 --> 00:55.056
Really? Again?

00:55.091 --> 00:56.124
Yeah, the good news is

00:56.159 --> 00:57.759
Sarah Grace will have
enough money for college.

00:57.794 --> 00:59.961
The bad news is
she'll have no idea who I am.

00:59.996 --> 01:02.130
- So, who are you guarding this time?
- Uh...

01:02.165 --> 01:04.800
The truth is,
I'm not allowed to say.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.402
What you mean,
you're not allowed to say?

01:07.748 --> 01:09.570
It's us. Who is it?

01:09.605 --> 01:11.642
Seriously, man. I can't.

01:11.662 --> 01:14.309
That means this goes beyond the
usual pro athlete or reality star.

01:14.343 --> 01:17.945
This is someone important,
someone revered.

01:17.979 --> 01:20.181
Perhaps the pope?

01:20.215 --> 01:22.582
The Dalai Lama? Angela Merkel?

01:22.617 --> 01:24.418
My lips are sealed.

01:25.264 --> 01:27.454
[Gasps] Ryan!
Is it One Direction?!

01:27.488 --> 01:30.024
You'd tell me, right?
Are they in town?

01:30.058 --> 01:32.592
- No, they're in Hong Kong.
- Right.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.796
Hey, how's my sister doing?

01:35.831 --> 01:38.665
Sleeping easier now that
I retired from the force.

01:39.316 --> 01:41.501
You don't miss the job at all,
working vice?

01:41.536 --> 01:42.569
Nah.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.604
I was dealing with lowlifes
every waking minute.

01:44.639 --> 01:46.840
Now I'm my own boss.
I'm telling you, Kev.

01:46.874 --> 01:50.176
Security
is a better way of life.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.779
I have to say, a...
a lot of guys when they retire,

01:52.814 --> 01:53.980
they just drift,

01:54.014 --> 01:57.383
but you're really
making this work.

01:58.014 --> 02:00.255
You could make it work
for you, too.

02:00.275 --> 02:01.654
Well...
Anyhow, there's a permanent spot for you

02:01.674 --> 02:04.390
with me the minute
you make the call.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.837
Wow, Frank.

02:07.504 --> 02:08.561
[Sighs]
That's a hell of an offer.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.395
Well, with your background,
I'd be lucky to have you.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.197
Now tell me, did you memorize
the rogue's gallery?

02:12.232 --> 02:14.309
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every face.

02:14.329 --> 02:15.772
[Beep]

02:15.792 --> 02:17.703
- So, what's the threat level here?
- Low.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.084
Huh. It's a charity event
for pure water now.

02:20.104 --> 02:21.907
It's not a Middle East
peace conference.

02:21.941 --> 02:24.309
There's gonna be protesters who
want to bother Congressman Lopez.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.512
- You've heard of him, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Who hasn't?

02:26.546 --> 02:28.313
He's a rising member
of the house,

02:28.348 --> 02:29.822
super-charismatic,
but let's face it,

02:29.842 --> 02:31.683
there's not a hell of
a lot of competition in that.

02:31.717 --> 02:32.650
He's still a stand-up guy.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.552
Every time he comes to the city,
he hires me,

02:34.587 --> 02:36.688
- so treat him right.
- All right.

02:36.722 --> 02:38.824
He's going places. [Beeping]

02:39.792 --> 02:41.393
[Whirring]

02:42.228 --> 02:44.996
- What's our E.T.A., Frank?
- Just a few more minutes, sir.

02:45.030 --> 02:47.915
Detective Kevin Ryan,
Congressman Alex Lopez.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.734
Frank speaks very highly of you.

02:49.769 --> 02:52.537
- As he does of you, sir.
- Oh, please.

02:52.571 --> 02:54.706
Call me Alex.
Or Mr. Lopez, if you want.

02:54.740 --> 02:55.707
My wife, Mia.

02:55.741 --> 02:58.544
You've met my chief of staff,
Megan Brooks.

02:58.564 --> 03:01.445
Kevin, what do you think
your job is tonight?

03:01.479 --> 03:02.779
To protect you, sir.

03:02.799 --> 03:05.416
Mostly it's my reputation
you need to protect.

03:05.450 --> 03:08.098
These days, a single photo
can cause major damage

03:08.118 --> 03:10.788
if some idiot approaches,
tries to create a scene.

03:10.822 --> 03:12.790
We'll make sure
that doesn't happen, sir.

03:12.824 --> 03:15.359
Good, because come
campaign season,

03:15.394 --> 03:17.995
I may need some men
I can rely on.

03:19.363 --> 03:21.064
Brooks: Sir,
about tonight's schedule.

03:21.098 --> 03:23.901
It's the red carpet and then
mingling over cocktails.

03:23.935 --> 03:25.569
Uh, these are the people

03:25.603 --> 03:26.737
that you're gonna
want to connect with.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.080
Some of them you know.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.140
All of them are major donors
with their own super pacs,

03:30.174 --> 03:32.781
who are still looking for a candidate
that they can believe in.

03:32.801 --> 03:35.812
I've broken down all of their
past campaign contributions

03:35.846 --> 03:37.447
- and net worth.
- I hope all these rich guys

03:37.481 --> 03:39.049
are ready to fork over
some of their money

03:39.083 --> 03:41.284
to Carolyn
and her pure water project.

03:41.319 --> 03:42.352
Oh, they are, darling.

03:42.386 --> 03:45.288
But the real reason
they're coming is to see you.

03:45.323 --> 03:47.290
[Chuckles]
Okay, after meet-and-greets,

03:47.325 --> 03:49.459
you're gonna take the stage
and introduce Carolyn,

03:49.493 --> 03:51.853
and here is your speech.

03:51.873 --> 03:54.432
Excuse me, folks.
We're pulling in now.

how's your fundraising?

04:01.638 --> 04:02.922
Miss, are you going to
stand by your husband?

04:02.942 --> 04:04.674
Thank you so much for coming.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.928
[Indistinct conversations

04:17.620 --> 04:19.988
Colton: Congressman Lopez,
any truth to the rumors

04:20.023 --> 04:21.656
that you're launching
a presidential campaign?

04:21.690 --> 04:22.992
Alex: Now, Bree,
tonight is all about

04:23.026 --> 04:24.593
my very good friend
Carolyn Decker

04:24.627 --> 04:25.994
and her pure water project.

04:26.028 --> 04:27.629
She's gonna be providing
clean water

04:27.663 --> 04:28.997
for families all over the globe.

04:29.031 --> 04:31.600
Work that is only possible
because of the support

04:31.634 --> 04:34.703
and generosity
of people like Alex Lopez.

04:34.737 --> 04:37.033
[Indistinct conversations
continue]

05:10.038 --> 05:12.706
What is this, blood? What, were
you gonna spray him with it?

05:12.741 --> 05:14.807
The drone strikes that he
supports kill innocent children.

05:14.842 --> 05:18.878
Detain him and get him
out of here.

05:18.913 --> 05:22.715
[Indistinct conversations
continue]

05:30.253 --> 05:31.427
Nice work.

05:31.447 --> 05:32.759
You might
find yourself protecting

05:32.793 --> 05:35.186
the first Latino
President of the United States.

05:45.439 --> 05:46.905
Congratulations, Jim.

05:46.940 --> 05:49.675
State party chairman...
it's a great fit for you.

05:49.709 --> 05:50.909
Well, thank you
for all your support, Alex.

05:50.944 --> 05:52.411
You know I'll have your back

05:52.446 --> 05:54.132
when you make a run
for that White House.

05:54.152 --> 05:55.932
A little too soon
for that kind of talk,

05:55.952 --> 05:58.084
- but I appreciate the thought.
- Enjoy your evening.

05:58.118 --> 06:00.312
- Likewise.
- All right.

06:02.789 --> 06:05.679
Mr. Shelton,
it's a pleasure to see you.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.052
You're being very coy
about your aspirations, Alex.

06:08.072 --> 06:10.035
But you obviously have some, or you
wouldn't be here.

06:10.055 --> 06:12.631
Well, for now, I'm just happy to serve
the people of my district.

06:12.665 --> 06:14.700
Being coy isn't in my nature.

06:14.734 --> 06:17.170
You and your ideas
aren't what this country needs,

06:17.190 --> 06:19.971
and I'll see to it
that you never become president.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.772
Brooks: Sir. [Chuckles]

06:21.807 --> 06:23.686
Nice talking to you.

06:25.377 --> 06:28.879
- Oh, Aryana Jones, this is Alex Lopez.
- Jones: Hi.

06:28.914 --> 06:30.449
Aryana, my wife and I
are huge fans.

06:30.469 --> 06:31.907
Can't wait to see
the performance tonight.

06:31.927 --> 06:34.552
You are too sweet, Alex. Please
come say hi after the show.

06:34.587 --> 06:35.753
- Yeah.
- Uh, sir.

06:35.787 --> 06:38.089
Five minutes until you're on.
You better get backstage.

06:38.123 --> 06:39.924
Okay. Okay. Bye.

06:39.958 --> 06:41.626
[Clears throat]

06:46.261 --> 06:49.053
Give me some room, fellas.
I'd like a word with Carolyn.

06:52.595 --> 06:55.805
- Ryan: Man, Lopez is a rock star.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.108
All right,
I'll keep eyes on him onstage.

06:58.143 --> 07:00.544
You cover him back here?
Yeah, copy that.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.897
Oh, God, I think I've been hit.

07:20.917 --> 07:23.390
Sir, stay right where you are.
Help's on the way, okay?

07:23.410 --> 07:26.035
Carolyn...

07:26.802 --> 07:29.838
Carolyn,
you're gonna be all right.

07:29.873 --> 07:31.374
Frank: Kev!

07:31.408 --> 07:32.975
Kev, what the hell happened?

07:33.009 --> 07:35.378
Call 911. We need a doctor
in here right now.

07:35.412 --> 07:36.945
God. Who did this?
Did you see who did this?

07:36.965 --> 07:38.348
No, no, no, no.

07:38.368 --> 07:41.850
Stop! Gray suit! Stay right where you are!
Go, go, go, go, go!

08:01.270 --> 08:03.331
[Indistinct shouting]

08:05.481 --> 08:07.615
NYPD! Stop that man!

08:07.635 --> 08:10.812
Police! Clear out of the way!
Move out of the away!

08:10.846 --> 08:12.514
[Siren wails] Freeze! Drop the weapon!
Stay where you are!

08:12.548 --> 08:13.748
Drop the weapon!
Put the weapon down!

08:13.782 --> 08:15.583
The shooter's getting away!

08:15.617 --> 08:16.751
Put the gun down now,
or I'll shoot!

08:48.697 --> 08:49.615
[Camera shutter clicks] Lucky.

08:49.635 --> 08:51.498
The round hit his collarbone,
but missed his heart.

08:51.533 --> 08:53.600
How about Carolyn Decker?

08:54.107 --> 08:55.902
Still in surgery.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.644
[Sighs]

08:57.664 --> 08:59.890
I took my eyes off him
for one second.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.275
No, no, no, kev. We are
gonna find this shooter.

09:01.309 --> 09:02.943
NYPD sealed off 10 square blocks
from this place.

09:02.963 --> 09:04.829
- Did we get a description?
- Only the one you gave us...

09:04.849 --> 09:06.136
six feet, medium build,
brown hair.

09:06.156 --> 09:07.613
Come on. No one saw his face?

09:07.633 --> 09:10.684
Yeah, they did, but they were
too busy panicking to remember.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.025
Look, why don't
we walk through what happened?

09:14.045 --> 09:16.251
No, Frank. I already did that.

09:16.271 --> 09:18.791
And what's the harm
in doing it again?

09:20.094 --> 09:21.128
Yeah.

09:21.162 --> 09:23.130
Okay.

09:23.523 --> 09:26.165
Shots rang out, three of 'em.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.669
I-I-I dove onto Lopez,
took Carolyn down, too.

09:29.704 --> 09:31.751
I saw they were hit. That's
when you came in.

09:31.771 --> 09:32.624
All right.

09:32.644 --> 09:35.475
And then I spotted the shooter.
And I only ever saw the back.

09:36.477 --> 09:37.681
All right,
think about his hands.

09:37.701 --> 09:39.555
Uh, rings on his fingers,
a watch?

09:40.064 --> 09:42.781
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Nothing like that.

09:43.265 --> 09:44.825
Wait. Uh...

09:46.289 --> 09:47.604
Blue card.

09:47.790 --> 09:50.942
Yeah, he had a pale-blue I.D. card
hanging from his neck.

09:51.476 --> 09:53.126
This guy had a press pass.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.928
- Kev, that's good.
- Yeah.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.941
- I'm gonna brief the NYPD.
- Okay.

- No, not really.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.005
Can we talk later?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.207
Uh, no. Kev, this can't wait.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.452
Beckett,
I have to work this case.

10:11.936 --> 10:14.418

I'm at the hospital.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.184
Carolyn Decker
just died in surgery.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.619
Kev? Are you there?

10:21.918 --> 10:23.655
Yeah, I'm here.

10:25.393 --> 10:27.937
I read your statement.
We should talk about it.

10:27.957 --> 10:30.662
No, no. There's no point.
I never saw the shooter's face.

10:30.696 --> 10:31.729
But... hey.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.565
Have you talked to Lopez yet?

10:33.599 --> 10:36.000
- No, why?
- The shooter was in his line of sight.

10:36.034 --> 10:38.402
- If anyone saw him, it was Lopez.
- Okay.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.572
I'm on it. I'll call you
as soon as I know something.

10:40.606 --> 10:41.973
[Siren wailing in distance]

10:41.993 --> 10:43.675
[Beep]

10:46.445 --> 10:48.479
[Camera shutters clicking]

10:54.453 --> 10:56.520
[Sighs]

10:56.554 --> 10:59.523
[No audio]

10:59.557 --> 11:01.592
[Footsteps approach]

11:05.279 --> 11:07.698
I'm sorry, sir.
Um, this area's offlimits.

11:07.732 --> 11:09.666
Carolyn is my daughter.

11:14.190 --> 11:16.374
I'm very sorry, sir.

11:16.573 --> 11:20.210
All she ever tried to do
was help people.

11:20.523 --> 11:21.844
Why her?

11:26.740 --> 11:27.283
Frank: Kev.

11:27.318 --> 11:28.885
Yeah. A-any luck
on that press pass?

11:28.919 --> 11:31.621
- Who did it belong to?
- No one.

11:31.655 --> 11:32.788
What do you mean, "no one"?

11:32.823 --> 11:35.425
Event security kept
extra passes on hold

11:35.459 --> 11:38.051
for last-minute attendees.

11:38.071 --> 11:40.161
So somehow our shooter
got ahold of one.

11:40.181 --> 11:42.431
- Damn it.
- Yeah.

11:42.465 --> 11:43.599
So, how's Ryan doing?

11:43.634 --> 11:45.434
He knows it's not his fault,
right?

11:45.468 --> 11:47.236
[Sighs] Well,
it happened on his watch.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.238
So for Ryan,
it means it's all on him

11:49.272 --> 11:51.240
until he finds this guy.

11:51.274 --> 11:53.942
Detective Beckett,
Jim Boyce, state party chair.

11:53.976 --> 11:55.777
This whole thing
is just terrible.

11:55.811 --> 11:57.246
Is... there any news?

11:57.280 --> 11:58.647
Just that we're doing
everything we can

11:58.681 --> 12:00.078
to apprehend the suspect.

12:00.098 --> 12:02.523
Well, I'm glad that you're
the one handling the case.

12:02.543 --> 12:04.360
I'm sorry, Mr. Boyce.
Do we know each other?

12:04.380 --> 12:07.256
No, but you have
an outstanding reputation,

12:07.290 --> 12:09.224
and it's gotten the attention
of the people in my world.

12:09.259 --> 12:10.992
I won't hold you, detective.

12:11.027 --> 12:13.491
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, likewise.

12:14.261 --> 12:15.764
What was that about?

12:15.798 --> 12:17.933
I have no idea.

12:17.967 --> 12:20.769
Maybe we can set up
a foundation in Carolyn's name.

12:20.803 --> 12:24.558
Yes, let's do that.
Like a-a scholarship fund.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.840
Brooks: Why don't I look
into that and get back to you

12:26.875 --> 12:28.342
- with options.
- That would be great, Megan.

12:28.377 --> 12:29.398
[Knock on door]

12:29.418 --> 12:33.448
Congressman Lopez, I'm Detective Beckett.
This is Mr. Castle.

12:33.482 --> 12:35.328
We're investigating
the shooting.

12:35.348 --> 12:37.651
You know, as a politician...
[Sighs]

12:37.686 --> 12:40.020
You know in the back of your
mind that harm may come to you,

12:40.055 --> 12:42.256
but it should never come
to an innocent bystander.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.157
Congressman,
did you notice anything

12:44.192 --> 12:47.357
or anyone suspicious
prior to the shooting?

12:47.377 --> 12:49.300
Everything seemed normal.

12:50.364 --> 12:52.132
[No audio]

12:54.183 --> 12:56.670
- Until it wasn't.
- Well, we believe that the shots

12:56.705 --> 12:58.606
originated from the north end
of the backstage area.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.474
Castle: That's the direction
you were facing

13:00.508 --> 13:01.941
when you were speaking
with Carolyn Decker.

13:01.976 --> 13:03.676
Did you notice anyone
in the background?

13:03.711 --> 13:09.477
I saw... stagehands,
production crew...

13:10.495 --> 13:11.818
There was this one guy.

13:11.852 --> 13:13.386
What was he wearing?

13:13.858 --> 13:15.346
A gray suit.

13:15.366 --> 13:16.856
Is that him?

13:16.890 --> 13:19.102
Is that the man
that killed Carolyn?

13:19.122 --> 13:22.266
Did you see his face?
Can you describe him?

13:29.194 --> 13:31.904
I can most definitely
describe him.

13:31.939 --> 13:34.072
This is our guy,
Eric Chambers...

13:34.107 --> 13:35.766
fringe blogger
and political activist

13:35.786 --> 13:37.209
with some pretty extreme ideas.

13:37.244 --> 13:38.810
Okay, he looks like the sketch,

13:38.845 --> 13:40.377
but can we place him
at the crime scene?

13:40.397 --> 13:42.814
CSU pulled Chambers' print
off the wall, so he was there.

13:42.849 --> 13:43.849
It's definitely him.

13:43.883 --> 13:46.185
I'm guessing he's not
a big supporter of Lopez?

13:46.219 --> 13:47.085
That's an understatement.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.855
Two weeks ago,
Chambers ranted on his blog

13:49.889 --> 13:52.057
about how Lopez posed a threat
to the American way of life

13:52.091 --> 13:54.828
and that he would get
what all traitors deserve.

13:54.848 --> 13:56.166
Where is Chambers now?

13:56.186 --> 13:57.574
His last known address was in the bowery.

13:57.594 --> 13:59.230
- Tactical's gearing up.
- Take Ryan.

13:59.265 --> 14:01.900
He should be there
when you pick Chambers up.

14:15.381 --> 14:16.585
[Sighs]

14:16.605 --> 14:18.949
Esposito: Tactical's about
three minutes out.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.951
How do we know Chambers
is at home?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.907
Tory pinged his cell.
He's in there.

14:25.136 --> 14:26.490
[Sighs]

14:28.147 --> 14:30.795
Hey, bro.
We're gonna get this guy.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.403
Yeah.

14:38.248 --> 14:39.936
There he is.

14:53.515 --> 14:54.951
He's on the move!

14:54.985 --> 14:56.820
Chambers, freeze!

14:57.635 --> 14:58.888
Chambers!

15:06.930 --> 15:08.898
Get the hell off me!

15:09.586 --> 15:11.062
[Grunting] You can't do this!

15:11.082 --> 15:12.993
[Gun cocks] Give me a reason!

15:14.003 --> 15:16.344
Eric Chambers,
you're under arrest.

15:17.436 --> 15:19.657
We got him, Ryan. We're good.

15:22.243 --> 15:24.310
Mr. Chambers, you are facing
charges for murder

15:24.345 --> 15:26.312
and the attempted assassination
of a congressman.

15:26.347 --> 15:29.308
Your best hope for leniency
is to confess.

15:29.643 --> 15:33.623
I'll never confess. I won't
give you the satisfaction.

15:33.643 --> 15:35.187
Okay, why don't you
consider this a chance

15:35.222 --> 15:37.089
to tell <i>your</i> side of the story?

15:37.124 --> 15:38.891
My side of the story
is that I'm innocent.

15:38.925 --> 15:40.092
This is all a charade.

15:40.127 --> 15:42.160
The evidence
would suggest otherwise.

15:43.153 --> 15:45.751
We found this stolen press pass
at your apartment

15:45.771 --> 15:48.506
along with a floor plan
of the ballroom.

15:48.526 --> 15:49.934
Then there's the pesky issue

15:49.969 --> 15:52.203
of you fleeing
after firing the shots.

15:52.625 --> 15:56.360
A true patriot, by definition,
is an enemy of the state.

15:56.546 --> 15:59.077
Our government has a long
and sorry history

15:59.111 --> 16:01.175
of persecuting people like me.

16:01.473 --> 16:03.281
So, you are the victim here?

16:03.315 --> 16:04.849
And you're the instrument
they're using

16:04.884 --> 16:06.500
to try to destroy me.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.254
You're too blind to see
that this is a script.

16:09.288 --> 16:10.889
You're just playing your part.

16:10.923 --> 16:13.291
Um, okay, here's the part
that fascinates me.

16:13.325 --> 16:15.926
You hated Lopez.
You wanted him dead.

16:15.946 --> 16:18.557
So you shot him.
Not fatally, it turns out.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.398
But still, you struck a blow

16:20.432 --> 16:23.033
for "true patriots" everywhere.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.986
Isn't this the proudest moment
of your life, Eric?

16:26.123 --> 16:27.371
I mean, why not own it?

16:27.406 --> 16:30.040
Why not take credit
for what you've accomplished?

16:34.077 --> 16:37.064
You want your day in court
so you can have a public forum.

16:37.084 --> 16:38.933
I'm done here.

16:42.432 --> 16:43.586
Chambers isn't talking.

16:43.621 --> 16:44.988
Well, that may not matter.

16:45.023 --> 16:47.257
I think we literally
just found the smoking gun.

16:47.292 --> 16:48.658
Esposito: Get this... unis found

16:48.693 --> 16:50.493
a .38-caliber pistol
in a storm drain

16:50.528 --> 16:52.876
about a block away
from the hotel, recently fired.

16:52.896 --> 16:54.494
Weren't there metal detectors
at the venue?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.800
Yeah. Which means that the gun
might have been waiting for him,

16:56.834 --> 16:58.802
- stashed at the hotel.
- Along with the press pass.

16:58.836 --> 17:00.903
So, that suggests
he wasn't acting alone.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.172
And Lopez might still
be a target.

17:03.207 --> 17:05.308
I'll call down to the hospital
and beef up security.

17:05.871 --> 17:08.310
If we can reconstruct Chambers'
movements from the venue,

17:08.345 --> 17:10.346
we might be able to figure out
how he got that gun.

17:10.380 --> 17:11.852
And who he was working with.

17:11.872 --> 17:13.449
You know, when we were
trying to I.D. Chambers,

17:13.483 --> 17:15.784
we rounded up hundreds of photos
from that event.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.419
I think I know where to start.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.421
[Beeping] Ellis: Some were
taken by photographers,

17:19.455 --> 17:21.022
others by guests
on their cellphones.

17:21.058 --> 17:24.125
I used facial recognition
to try and search for Chambers.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.193
Did you find him?

17:25.228 --> 17:27.363
He appears in 14 pictures,
mostly in the background.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.197
Since each photo
is time-stamped,

17:29.232 --> 17:32.005
I was able to plot
his movement at the venue.

17:32.166 --> 17:35.537
Each dot represents
where Chambers was photographed.

17:35.572 --> 17:37.339
Does anyone in the photos
ever hand him something?

17:37.374 --> 17:40.475
Does he ever retrieve an object
the size of a gun?

17:40.509 --> 17:42.477
I'm afraid not,
but there is a five-minute gap

17:42.511 --> 17:44.346
when Chambers
is unaccounted for.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.347
[Keyboard clacking]

17:45.381 --> 17:48.850
This is the last photo
before the missing time.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.777
That door leads
to a storage area.

17:51.797 --> 17:53.654
Then maybe that's where the
gun was stashed. No. No, no.

17:53.689 --> 17:56.580
Security protocol would have
had that door locked for the evening.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.658
Well, this room wasn't locked.

17:57.693 --> 18:00.730
Here's another picture of it
taken around the same time.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.096
[Beeping]

18:04.672 --> 18:06.367
That guy works for the hotel.

18:06.402 --> 18:08.168
If that door
was supposed to be locked,

18:08.203 --> 18:10.104
what was he doing in there?

18:12.360 --> 18:13.911
Julian Bailey?

18:14.929 --> 18:15.964
Yes?

18:15.984 --> 18:19.839
Do you mind telling us what you were doing
in the storage room last night?

18:19.859 --> 18:21.608
I wasn't in any storage room.

18:21.628 --> 18:24.624
Oh, then who's this?
Your evil twin?

18:26.088 --> 18:26.921
Okay, yeah.

18:26.955 --> 18:30.208
I snuck in there for a girl,
you know?

18:30.228 --> 18:32.682
We were gonna meet up,
but she never showed.

18:32.702 --> 18:35.333
All right.
Have you seen this guy?

18:35.829 --> 18:37.597
Yeah, he came in the room.

18:37.632 --> 18:40.567
- I wasn't supposed to be there, so I hid.
- What was he doing in the room?

18:40.601 --> 18:42.333
Was he looking for something?
Did he have a gun?

18:42.353 --> 18:44.604
A gun? No,
he was with another dude.

18:44.639 --> 18:46.339
They were talking all intense.

18:46.373 --> 18:47.340
We have to be smart

18:47.374 --> 18:49.742
about when and where
we bring Mr. Lopez down.

18:49.776 --> 18:51.510
Chambers: I've got it covered,
okay?

18:51.545 --> 18:53.779
Lopez is gonna get
what's coming to him.

18:53.814 --> 18:55.881
And you didn't think
to mention this before?

18:55.916 --> 18:57.283
I was afraid I'd get fired.

18:57.318 --> 18:58.884
Plus, by the time
I realized he was the one

18:58.919 --> 19:00.886
who shot the congressman,
you guys had already caught him.

19:00.921 --> 19:03.188
All right, this other dude
that he was talking to,

19:03.222 --> 19:04.866
did you see his face?

19:04.886 --> 19:06.291
Just for a second

19:06.326 --> 19:08.522
as the two of them
were walking out.

19:13.667 --> 19:14.667
Castle: Carl Shelton?

19:14.701 --> 19:17.242
As in billionaire industrialist
Carl Shelton?

19:17.262 --> 19:19.071
Yeah, and he's no fan of Lopez.

19:19.105 --> 19:20.572
I saw Shelton
tell Lopez to his face

19:20.606 --> 19:21.806
that he would never
become president.

19:21.841 --> 19:23.241
Maybe Shelton
wanted to make sure,

19:23.276 --> 19:25.222
so he colluded with Chambers.

19:25.242 --> 19:26.644
Esposito: It's starting
to look that way,

19:26.679 --> 19:28.580
especially since Shelton
is co-owner of this hotel.

19:28.614 --> 19:31.216
Which means he would
have access to a press pass

19:31.250 --> 19:33.485
and know how to get a gun
past security.

19:33.519 --> 19:36.120
It's money versus power,
tycoon versus politician...

19:36.154 --> 19:38.289
a story as old
as America itself.

19:38.323 --> 19:40.458
All right, let's try and
find out what the connection is

19:40.493 --> 19:42.658
between Eric Chambers
and Carl Shelton.

19:42.678 --> 19:45.429
I'm afraid Mr. Shelton
does not know anyone

19:45.464 --> 19:47.304
- named Eric Chambers.
- Well, we have a witness

19:47.324 --> 19:49.501
that saw the two of you
talking to each other.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.275
That witness is mistaken.

19:51.747 --> 19:54.571
[Sighs]
Mr. Shelton, you financed

19:54.606 --> 19:57.074
a group called
America for Americans.

19:57.109 --> 19:59.076
It's co-founded
by Eric Chambers.

19:59.111 --> 20:01.078
- My client...
- I...

20:01.113 --> 20:03.647
I fund many
grassroots organizations

20:03.681 --> 20:06.317
who share my concern
about the decline

20:06.351 --> 20:09.319
of this great nation,
but I'm not acquainted

20:09.353 --> 20:11.577
with every person
in every group.

20:11.597 --> 20:13.957
Eric Chambers' views
are hard to miss.

20:13.992 --> 20:15.959
He advocates armed resistance

20:15.994 --> 20:18.461
against what he calls
"the U.S. police state."

20:18.496 --> 20:20.463
Well, there's nothing wrong
with ordinary Americans

20:20.498 --> 20:23.099
defending themselves
against government overreach.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.501
Castle: Well,
this isn't about overreach,

20:24.535 --> 20:26.503
this is about you
getting rid of a politician

20:26.537 --> 20:28.048
who stood against you.

20:29.177 --> 20:31.039
W-what is that, Mr. Castle?

20:31.212 --> 20:33.228
Your latest work of fiction?

20:33.248 --> 20:34.253
[Chuckles]

20:34.513 --> 20:36.312
I believe that concludes
our interview.

20:36.347 --> 20:39.482
If you have more questions,
get a subpoena.

20:39.517 --> 20:41.283
Mr. Shelton,
you put Chambers up to this

20:41.317 --> 20:43.183
and I intend to prove it.

20:43.891 --> 20:45.901
Good luck with that.

20:48.729 --> 20:50.690
[Door opens]

20:58.636 --> 21:00.323
Esposito: What's up, bro?

21:00.472 --> 21:02.671
Everyone's gone.
What you still doing here?

21:02.705 --> 21:04.239
[Sighs]

21:04.274 --> 21:06.131
Thinking.

21:06.151 --> 21:09.744
Come on. This is a win.
We got the shooter.

21:09.779 --> 21:11.246
What about Shelton?

21:11.281 --> 21:13.248
We'll build a case against him.

21:13.283 --> 21:15.976
And I bet that Chambers will
help us out and roll on Shelton.

21:15.996 --> 21:17.304
Why hasn't he done that already?

21:17.324 --> 21:21.056
Maybe Shelton made Chambers
some promises

21:21.090 --> 21:22.486
in return for him
keeping his mouth shut.

21:22.506 --> 21:24.111
Why would a man
in Shelton's situation

21:24.131 --> 21:25.493
risk being seen with Chambers?

21:25.527 --> 21:27.596
Because he's like
all these other

21:27.630 --> 21:30.679
rich sons of bitches who think
they can get away with anything.

21:30.699 --> 21:31.799
[Sighs] I don't know.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.569
Something about this
just isn't sitting right, Javi.

21:36.205 --> 21:37.771
You're spinning.

21:37.806 --> 21:39.574
You just need
a good night's sleep.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.742
In the morning,
everything will be clear to you.

21:41.776 --> 21:43.010
All right?

21:47.552 --> 21:49.650
[Cellphone ringing]

21:53.293 --> 21:54.670
[Beep]

21:55.899 --> 21:57.324
Hello.

22:00.561 --> 22:02.195
What?!

22:02.230 --> 22:03.963
Ryan: Right. How about now?

22:03.998 --> 22:05.432
- Castle: That looks good.
- Okay.

22:05.466 --> 22:08.235
Oh! Good, you're here.

22:08.269 --> 22:10.512
What is this?
What are you guys doing?

22:10.532 --> 22:14.322
Ah, well, Ryan was working
all night, and he texted me.

22:14.342 --> 22:16.221
You texted Castle and not me?

22:16.241 --> 22:17.944
Well, when you have
a crazy theory,

22:17.978 --> 22:19.298
you don't call
the voice of reason.

22:19.318 --> 22:20.514
What... what theory?

22:20.534 --> 22:22.214
Eric Chambers
is not our shooter.

22:22.249 --> 22:23.946
We got the wrong guy.

22:27.409 --> 22:30.691
You're telling me Eric Chambers
is not our shooter?

22:30.711 --> 22:31.711
Based on what?

22:31.745 --> 22:33.113
Physics, sir.

22:33.147 --> 22:34.380
Beckett: Congressman Lopez said

22:34.414 --> 22:35.782
that when he talked
to Carolyn Decker,

22:35.816 --> 22:38.184
he saw Chambers by the far wall.

22:38.218 --> 22:40.186
Which is where CSU
found his prints.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.354
Castle: But seconds later,
our assassin opens fire...

22:42.389 --> 22:43.489
three shots.

22:43.523 --> 22:45.725
The first one strikes Lopez
beneath the left clavicle.

22:45.759 --> 22:48.327
The second one grazes
Carolyn Decker's shoulder,

22:48.361 --> 22:50.396
and the third one strikes her
in the upper back.

22:50.430 --> 22:52.664
That shot severs
her pulmonary artery.

22:52.699 --> 22:54.200
She never has a chance.

22:54.234 --> 22:55.568
How does any of this
lead you to think

22:55.602 --> 22:57.503
that Chambers
is not the assassin.

22:57.537 --> 22:58.904
Chambers' vantage point.

22:58.938 --> 23:02.020
He had a side-angle view
of Lopez and Carolyn Decker.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.410
So how did Chambers manage
to shoot Carolyn in the back?

23:04.444 --> 23:06.579
The answer
is that he couldn't have,

23:06.613 --> 23:08.480
not unless that bullet
magically took

23:08.514 --> 23:09.581
a hard right turn in midair.

23:09.616 --> 23:12.884
Which means the shots were fired
from the grassy knoll,

23:12.919 --> 23:15.153
- metaphorically speaking.
- Gates: Detective Beckett,

23:15.187 --> 23:17.745
do you actually find
any of this plausible?

23:18.688 --> 23:20.659
Yes, sir, plausible enough
that I'm getting ballistics

23:20.693 --> 23:22.883
to reevaluate the crime scene.

23:23.838 --> 23:25.705
Chambers had motive,

23:25.725 --> 23:28.099
he stole a press pass,
he fled the shooting.

23:28.134 --> 23:30.235
- How do you explain all that?
- I think Chambers

23:30.269 --> 23:32.870
- was set up to be the fall guy.
- Probably by Carl Shelton.

23:32.904 --> 23:35.906
Then why isn't he vigorously
protesting his innocence?

23:35.941 --> 23:37.493
Chambers distrusts authority.

23:37.513 --> 23:39.602
And he believes that we're part
of a plot against him.

23:39.622 --> 23:42.412
Nonetheless, Eric Chambers
remains our prime suspect

23:42.447 --> 23:44.115
unless proof comes in
that he isn't.

23:44.149 --> 23:45.911
In the meantime, sir,

23:45.931 --> 23:48.373
I'd like to take
another run at him.

23:53.101 --> 23:54.645
You're wasting your time.

23:54.665 --> 23:56.560
I'm not talking.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.364
[Sighs] Well, that's okay.

24:00.547 --> 24:04.630
You don't have to talk.
You can just listen.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.637
[Scoffs]

24:07.332 --> 24:10.774
Yeah, we know that...
you're not the shooter.

24:11.340 --> 24:12.075
Of course you do.

24:12.109 --> 24:14.306
You people orchestrated
the whole thing.

24:14.326 --> 24:15.945
You know, Eric,
I got a news flash for you.

24:15.980 --> 24:19.415
You're not the focus of some
big governmental conspiracy.

24:19.449 --> 24:22.722
No one has the...
least bit of interest in you.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.620
[Sighs]

24:24.943 --> 24:27.734
Actually, I take that back.

24:29.478 --> 24:32.094
Someone is very interested
in you...

24:33.331 --> 24:35.898
whoever set you up.

24:36.148 --> 24:41.165
Somebody went to a significant
amount of trouble to frame you,

24:41.185 --> 24:42.910
and now...

24:46.608 --> 24:49.036
now you know too much.

24:49.992 --> 24:52.681
You're a loose end.

24:53.652 --> 24:56.444
I don't see
a very bright future for you.

25:02.175 --> 25:04.792
You honestly expect me
to believe a word you say?

25:04.827 --> 25:07.829
Eh, that's up to you.
It's your life.

25:10.165 --> 25:13.104
Just tell me everything
about how you got backstage,

25:13.124 --> 25:15.743
and I'll keep you safe.

25:17.207 --> 25:18.806
If not, I can't help you.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.075
Nobody can.

25:25.246 --> 25:27.348
[Sighs] Just think about it.

25:27.382 --> 25:28.950
Um...

25:29.279 --> 25:31.192
But don't think too long.

25:35.027 --> 25:36.566
Wait.

25:39.383 --> 25:41.562
So, if Chambers
isn't our shooter,

25:41.596 --> 25:43.193
then what was he doing
backstage?

25:43.213 --> 25:46.196
He wanted to make a political
statement by confronting Lopez

25:46.216 --> 25:48.034
during his speech
in front of the cameras.

25:48.069 --> 25:51.259
That way, he knew that it would blow up
on the 24-hour news cycle.

25:51.279 --> 25:52.610
All right,
what about Carl Shelton?

25:52.630 --> 25:54.908
Castle, it's looking like
Shelton may not be involved.

25:54.942 --> 25:56.576
The billionaire industrialist

25:56.610 --> 25:58.378
with his grubby hands
on the levers of power?

25:58.412 --> 25:59.913
Of course he's involved.

25:59.947 --> 26:01.248
They were seen
in the storage room.

26:01.282 --> 26:04.350
That's because Shelton realized that
Chambers had crashed the event.

26:04.385 --> 26:06.647
So, he tried to talk him
out of making a scene.

26:06.667 --> 26:08.688
So, where did Chambers
get the press pass from?

26:08.722 --> 26:10.523
It was left for him
in his mailbox.

26:10.557 --> 26:12.024
In his mailbox?

26:12.058 --> 26:14.346
- By whom?
- An anonymous sympathizer

26:14.366 --> 26:16.095
contacted him
through his website,

26:16.129 --> 26:18.230
left him the pass,
and instructions

26:18.265 --> 26:20.099
about where to wait backstage.

26:20.133 --> 26:23.336
[Chuckles] Okay,
can I... can I just say...

26:23.561 --> 26:26.338
I know I have
occasionally theorized

26:26.372 --> 26:27.840
that a conspiracy was afoot.

26:27.874 --> 26:29.148
"Occasionally"?

26:29.168 --> 26:31.543
But this time,
a conspiracy really is afoot.

26:31.577 --> 26:33.445
Guys, Chambers was clearly
being manipulated

26:33.479 --> 26:36.515
by person or persons unknown
into being backstage

26:36.549 --> 26:38.390
so he'd be the perfect patsy.

26:38.410 --> 26:40.452
Why would someone
go to all that trouble

26:40.486 --> 26:42.554
to set him up
as Lopez's shooter?

26:42.588 --> 26:44.122
Esposito:
I may have an answer for that.

26:44.156 --> 26:47.086
Prelim ballistics report.
You were right.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.394
The shots did not come from
where Chambers was standing.

26:49.429 --> 26:51.554
- So where did the shots come from?
- Well, based on trajectories,

26:51.574 --> 26:53.865
the shots were fired
from this position right here.

26:53.899 --> 26:55.434
The shooter was behind
the lighting stanchion.

26:55.468 --> 26:57.268
That's why no one saw him.

26:57.303 --> 26:59.137
He took a shot and then
he slipped out the back.

26:59.171 --> 27:00.972
Yeah, it's good concealment.

27:01.006 --> 27:03.074
Nobody would be
able to spot him,

27:03.108 --> 27:05.206
but check out this angle.

27:05.226 --> 27:07.212
Carolyn Decker's blocking Lopez.

27:07.246 --> 27:09.580
That would explain
why the assassin missed Lopez.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.582
Unless he didn't miss him.

27:11.616 --> 27:14.618
Exactly, Carolyn Decker
was almost square to the shooter

27:14.653 --> 27:17.221
and she's the one who got hit
center-mass.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.714
You guys, what if we're looking
at this the wrong way?

27:19.734 --> 27:21.109
And Carolyn Decker's the real target.

27:21.129 --> 27:22.393
All right,
we'll dig through her life.

27:22.427 --> 27:24.347
See if anyone had motive
to do this.

27:24.367 --> 27:26.811
There's something
you should see first.

27:28.633 --> 27:30.601
This is from
Eric Chambers' building.

27:30.635 --> 27:32.469
I was reviewing it
to paste together his timeline

27:32.503 --> 27:33.837
when I saw this.

27:33.872 --> 27:36.473
He goes straight
to Chambers' mailbox.

27:36.507 --> 27:38.641
Okay, that is definitely
not the mailman.

27:38.676 --> 27:41.478
He must be leaving the press pass
for Chambers. When was this?

27:41.512 --> 27:42.993
Three hours before the shooting.

27:43.013 --> 27:44.681
Can we get a look
at this dude's face?

27:44.701 --> 27:46.542
Not a good one.

27:47.151 --> 27:49.268
[Beep]

27:51.514 --> 27:53.623
Oh, my God.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.684
What is it?

27:55.994 --> 27:59.629
That's my brother-in-law.
That's Frank.

28:03.376 --> 28:05.044
Are you sure that's Frank Kelly?

28:06.198 --> 28:08.581
Yeah. No question.

28:09.385 --> 28:11.843
Ryan, I know
this is hard, but...

28:13.232 --> 28:15.185
Where was Frank
during those shots?

28:15.205 --> 28:16.881
All right,
I'll keep eyes on him onstage.

28:16.901 --> 28:18.767
- You cover him back here?
- Yeah.

28:20.091 --> 28:22.333
He was on the other side
of the curtain.

28:22.353 --> 28:24.512
He went into the ballroom
to cover Lopez.

28:24.532 --> 28:26.510
Did you see him out there?

28:27.065 --> 28:28.231
No.

28:28.594 --> 28:31.668
So, you don't really know
where he was.

28:31.702 --> 28:34.103
After the shots,
how soon did he arrive?

28:37.035 --> 28:38.554
10 seconds, maybe.

28:38.574 --> 28:39.676
Long enough for him to get

28:39.710 --> 28:42.749
from the light stanchion
to where you saw him.

28:43.816 --> 28:45.392
So, what are you saying here,

28:46.732 --> 28:48.484
that Frank killed
Carolyn Decker?

28:48.518 --> 28:50.586
- Why would he?
- I don't know,

28:50.620 --> 28:52.408
but we need to consider
the possibility.

28:52.428 --> 28:55.146
At the very least,
he was involved,

28:55.431 --> 28:56.693
so we're bringing him in.

28:56.727 --> 28:59.261
Good. Because you know what?

28:59.296 --> 29:01.755
He'll tell his side of the story.
There's an explanation for this.

29:01.775 --> 29:04.600
I-I'm sure there is, Ryan. A-and
nothing would make us happier.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.806
Guys, this is my brother-in-law.

29:06.826 --> 29:09.205
There's no way he can be
mixed up in something like this.

29:09.239 --> 29:11.073
Hey, bro.

29:11.107 --> 29:12.708
I'm sorry to say that, uh,

29:12.742 --> 29:14.510
unis just tried to
pick up Frank.

29:14.917 --> 29:17.478
As soon as he saw
the patrol car, he bolted.

29:17.498 --> 29:18.914
They lost him.

29:19.310 --> 29:21.083
Gates: Issue an a.P.B.
See if there's any connection

29:21.117 --> 29:23.719
between Frank Kelly
and Carolyn Decker.

29:24.231 --> 29:25.547
I'm on it.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.857
Uh, where are <i>you going?</i>

29:29.294 --> 29:31.751
I'm gonna go find Frank.

29:31.927 --> 29:34.396
I'll go with you.

29:35.302 --> 29:38.553
Thanks, Javi, but...
This is family here.

29:38.573 --> 29:41.060
I got to do this one alone.

29:42.538 --> 29:43.954
Okay.

29:44.921 --> 29:47.241
[Knock on door]

29:50.866 --> 29:52.212
I need to talk to Frank, Gwen.

29:52.247 --> 29:53.280
He's not here.

29:53.314 --> 29:55.015
Where is he, then?

29:55.050 --> 29:57.017
Kevin, don't you walk in here

29:57.052 --> 29:58.934
and start pointing fingers
at your own family.

29:58.954 --> 30:02.210
He ran!
Why would he do that, Gwen?!

30:02.623 --> 30:06.021
- What's he into?
- Nothing!

30:07.460 --> 30:09.235
I know that look.

30:09.768 --> 30:11.364
Yeah, that's the look
that you used to get

30:11.398 --> 30:12.532
when you'd sneak a cigarette

30:12.567 --> 30:14.191
and then you'd lie to mom
about it.

30:14.211 --> 30:17.938
Look, Gwen, I'm here for you,
but I need to know the truth.

30:18.214 --> 30:19.877
What's he into?

30:23.978 --> 30:27.313
Things were tight last year.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.840
You know, both kids
are at St. Margaret's now,

30:29.860 --> 30:32.385
and that costs an arm and a leg.

30:32.419 --> 30:34.821
But then some money
started coming in.

30:34.841 --> 30:36.422
From where?

30:36.457 --> 30:39.392
Frank said that he was
picking up extra work, and...

30:39.426 --> 30:41.393
But he never ran it
through the company.

30:41.427 --> 30:43.915
- It was always cash.
- How much cash?

30:43.935 --> 30:46.899
Over time... close to 50 grand.

30:47.452 --> 30:49.715
Kevin! You know Frank.

30:49.735 --> 30:51.882
- You know he would never hurt a soul.
- Okay.

30:51.902 --> 30:54.984
Then tell me where he is before
he's the one who gets hurt.

30:59.445 --> 31:00.812
Any word from Ryan?

31:00.846 --> 31:04.158
Uh, no. Not yet.
It's got to be tough.

31:04.178 --> 31:06.684
Frank is like a brother to him.

31:06.719 --> 31:09.754
Well, maybe Frank isn't in this
as deep as we think.

31:09.788 --> 31:11.490
Esposito still hasn't found

31:11.524 --> 31:13.525
anything connecting him
to Carolyn Decker.

31:13.559 --> 31:15.693
Yeah, well, neither have I.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.329
[Sighs] I hate this part.

31:18.363 --> 31:19.697
Going through
a victim's effects?

31:19.732 --> 31:21.779
Yeah, especially a purse.

31:21.799 --> 31:25.117
Everything in it
is just so intimate.

31:25.137 --> 31:27.672
[Zipper opens] It's like you
get a chance to really see

31:27.706 --> 31:29.947
who a person is...

31:31.143 --> 31:32.610
Or was.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.718
And who was Carolyn Decker?

31:36.047 --> 31:40.817
Uh, she was, um... a workaholic.

31:41.049 --> 31:43.543
The daily alarm on her phone
is set for 4:00 a.m.

31:43.563 --> 31:45.088
And her calendar shows

31:45.123 --> 31:47.998
that she was completely
dedicated to pure water now.

31:48.018 --> 31:51.040
She has that handwritten letter
from a little boy in Africa

31:51.060 --> 31:53.659
in her wallet thanking her.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.463
His village was almost
completely wiped out by cholera.

31:56.483 --> 31:58.834
And then once they set up
the water-filtration system

31:58.854 --> 32:01.471
in the village, nobody died.

32:01.905 --> 32:04.424
She was actually
making a difference.

32:04.896 --> 32:07.315
You know,
you make a difference, too.

32:07.601 --> 32:10.180
[Chuckles] Yeah, not like her.

32:12.156 --> 32:13.583
Okay.

32:13.617 --> 32:15.485
What?

32:17.145 --> 32:18.634
She's got a second phone.

32:18.654 --> 32:20.682
Anything on it?

32:20.702 --> 32:24.493
Yeah. Motive for murder.

32:48.073 --> 32:50.058
What did you do, Frank?

32:51.163 --> 32:52.854
Not what you're thinking, man.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.856
That's a nice touch,

32:54.890 --> 32:57.458
the way you acted all surprised
when I remembered

32:57.492 --> 32:59.393
that Chambers was wearing
a press pass.

32:59.428 --> 33:01.078
[Chuckles] Well,
you weren't surprised Frank,

33:01.098 --> 33:03.631
because all along
it was you that gave it to him.

33:04.875 --> 33:06.601
You hired me for this job

33:06.635 --> 33:09.370
because you knew
that I would never suspect you.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.204
You knew that you could
steer the investigation.

33:11.224 --> 33:12.806
No. No, it wasn't like that.

33:12.841 --> 33:14.769
And nobody was ever
supposed to get hurt.

33:14.789 --> 33:17.461
What the hell
does that even mean?

33:17.481 --> 33:19.087
Carolyn Decker, she's dead.

33:19.107 --> 33:21.023
I blamed myself.
All along it was you.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.798
Kev, I got myself into something

33:22.818 --> 33:25.839
and I-I can't get myself out.

33:25.859 --> 33:27.721
How... How could you do this?

33:28.321 --> 33:31.658
How... how could you
do this to Gwen and the kids?

33:31.692 --> 33:34.661
Look me in the eyes
and tell me...

33:35.283 --> 33:37.202
that you killed Carolyn.

33:37.475 --> 33:41.061
Did you know her?
Did you do it for the money?

33:42.116 --> 33:45.032
I didn't kill nobody.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.342
Well, you had to have
done something, Frank.

33:49.377 --> 33:50.977
Where did you get all that cash?

33:53.377 --> 33:55.785
The security thing...

33:56.715 --> 33:59.652
ain't going as good as I said.

33:59.686 --> 34:00.619
[Sighs]

34:00.654 --> 34:03.458
Times are tough, you know?
I needed money.

34:03.478 --> 34:07.777
So I made some cash on the side
by selling access.

34:07.797 --> 34:09.167
What kind of access?

34:09.187 --> 34:11.797
Slipping people in
backstage at a concert,

34:12.469 --> 34:14.600
passes to fringe journalists,

34:14.634 --> 34:16.001
you know,
who can't get in the front door.

34:16.034 --> 34:17.536
I swear to you,
I didn't know that press pass

34:17.570 --> 34:18.588
was going to Chambers.

34:18.608 --> 34:21.194
I'm just trying to provide
for my family, for your sister.

34:21.214 --> 34:23.911
I thought, of all people,
you'd understand that.

34:25.812 --> 34:27.610
Who paid you for that pass?

34:27.858 --> 34:29.583
Nah.

34:29.603 --> 34:31.987
I've told you everything I know.

34:32.311 --> 34:35.388
And that's all
you're gonna get 'cause...

34:35.408 --> 34:38.726
We both know what happens
to cops in prison.

34:39.992 --> 34:42.445
And I ain't turning myself in.

34:44.629 --> 34:46.431
Frank.

34:48.266 --> 34:50.511
Frank!
[Gun cocks]

35:08.309 --> 35:10.509
Ryan, I'm so sorry.

35:12.032 --> 35:14.579
Well, it's gonna be
a lot harder on my sister.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.215
[Sighs]

35:16.249 --> 35:18.536
But at least Frank
isn't our shooter.

35:18.556 --> 35:19.752
Does he know who is?

35:19.772 --> 35:22.922
No, he received $5,000
in an envelope

35:22.956 --> 35:25.328
along with an address of
where to leave to press pass.

35:25.348 --> 35:26.520
And who paid him?

35:26.540 --> 35:29.088
He was contacted by an outfit
called Manhattan politics.

35:29.108 --> 35:31.496
Turns out it's a front
with a dead e-mail address.

35:31.516 --> 35:33.841
So, whoever's behind this
set up Eric Chambers

35:33.861 --> 35:35.534
and used Frank to do it.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.135
Can we trace the money?

35:37.169 --> 35:39.735
No luck so far.
Though the bills are sequential.

35:39.755 --> 35:41.497
So it probably came
from a bank withdrawal.

35:41.517 --> 35:42.639
What about the envelope?

35:42.659 --> 35:44.943
CSU pulled off a partial print,

35:44.977 --> 35:46.945
but it's not enough
to run against the database.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.214
Maybe we don't have to.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.548
What do you mean?

35:50.568 --> 35:53.427
Well, given the texts we found
on Carolyn Decker's phone,

35:53.447 --> 35:56.306
we may only have to check
one name.

35:56.326 --> 35:58.723
Alex will be discharged
later today,

35:58.757 --> 36:01.584
and we are so grateful
and humbled

36:01.604 --> 36:05.120
by the outpouring of support
from all over the world.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.429
But it's also a time of mourning

36:08.449 --> 36:11.792
for the tragic death
of Carolyn Decker.

36:12.304 --> 36:16.239
My husband will honor her name
by continuing to fight

36:16.274 --> 36:18.041
for the people of this country

36:18.076 --> 36:21.545
and for those who voices
aren't always heard.

36:22.296 --> 36:24.281
Thank you.

36:25.523 --> 36:27.250
Excuse me.

36:27.285 --> 36:30.187
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle,
what brings you here?

36:30.221 --> 36:31.121
This.

36:31.155 --> 36:33.223
It contained cash
used to buy a press pass

36:33.257 --> 36:34.858
for Eric Chambers.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.800
A press pass?
That's how the assassin got in?

36:37.820 --> 36:40.297
Castle: Well, you should know.
You're fingerprint is on the envelope.

36:40.331 --> 36:42.432
Where were you
during the shooting Mrs. Lopez?

36:42.467 --> 36:44.869
Because we can't account
for you.

36:45.229 --> 36:49.613
You can't be suggesting
that I tried to kill my husband.

36:49.633 --> 36:51.440
Oh, no. No, no, not at all.

36:51.475 --> 36:54.076
We're suggesting
you tried to kill Carolyn Decker

36:54.111 --> 36:55.619
and succeeded.

36:55.639 --> 36:58.759
That's ridiculous
and despicable.

36:58.779 --> 37:01.551
These are texts between
your husband and Carolyn.

37:01.585 --> 37:04.320
Going back three years,
when their affair first started.

37:04.354 --> 37:06.255
That's motive for murder,
Mrs. Lopez.

37:06.289 --> 37:09.225
Now, maybe it was
purely personal,

37:09.259 --> 37:10.483
or maybe you saw her
as a liability

37:10.503 --> 37:12.261
to your husband's chances
of becoming president.

37:12.295 --> 37:14.561
Either way,
Carolyn Decker had to go.

37:14.581 --> 37:18.100
But you had to make sure
that it didn't lead back to you.

37:18.135 --> 37:19.835
So, you created a narrative

37:19.869 --> 37:22.270
where Mr. Lopez was
being targeted by an assassin,

37:22.304 --> 37:24.773
and Eric Chambers was the patsy.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.975
A plan which happened to raise
your husband's profile

37:27.010 --> 37:29.476
on the national stage,
as we just saw.

37:29.496 --> 37:32.147
Well done. You don't think
I knew about the affair?

37:32.491 --> 37:36.491
I understood the deal I was
making when I married Alex.

37:36.511 --> 37:38.420
And far from a liability,

37:38.454 --> 37:41.256
Carolyn was
his behindthe-scenes advisor.

37:41.290 --> 37:43.952
She was a conduit
to major donors who backed him...

37:43.972 --> 37:46.851
Where were you
during the shooting Mrs. Lopez?

37:50.822 --> 37:54.869
Alex and I have an agreement.

37:56.048 --> 37:58.411
[Inhales deeply]
I was at the hotel.

37:58.431 --> 38:00.466
Room 717.

38:02.191 --> 38:06.977
I can give you her name
if it's absolutely necessary.

38:06.997 --> 38:08.549
It will be.

38:08.584 --> 38:11.767
But it still doesn't
explain away your fingerprint.

38:13.182 --> 38:15.222
This envelope
is from Alex's office.

38:15.256 --> 38:18.858
I know that because
I ordered the stationary.

38:18.893 --> 38:20.527
I help out there sometimes.

38:20.562 --> 38:22.362
I send letters
to his constituents.

38:22.397 --> 38:24.331
I must have touched it
at some point.

38:24.365 --> 38:26.803
Who else has access
to his envelopes?

38:29.930 --> 38:32.138
I'm afraid I don't understand.

38:32.172 --> 38:33.907
So, you think that one of my
people played a part in this?

38:33.941 --> 38:36.859
Well, that's impossible.
I-I personally vetted everyone.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.712
Once we knew where to look,

38:38.746 --> 38:40.714
we matched the serial numbers
from those bills

38:40.748 --> 38:42.816
to a withdrawal
from your bank account.

38:42.836 --> 38:43.478
My bank?

38:43.498 --> 38:45.751
Specifically, your campaign travel account.

38:45.785 --> 38:46.885
That can't be.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.188
I'm the only one authorized
to access the account...

38:49.223 --> 38:50.649
just me.

38:50.959 --> 38:53.359
- And Megan.
- Castle: Who is, oddly enough,

38:53.393 --> 38:55.261
who showed up
on the bank security video

38:55.295 --> 38:56.966
making the withdrawal.

38:57.313 --> 38:58.988
Alex, this is a mistake.

38:59.008 --> 39:02.101
I would never do this.
I have no reason to.

39:02.135 --> 39:04.103
That's not exactly true.

39:04.137 --> 39:06.338
We looked into
Carolyn's texts again.

39:06.372 --> 39:07.823
She had misgivings about you.

39:07.843 --> 39:10.109
Carolyn believed
that you could make it

39:10.143 --> 39:13.122
all the way to the presidency
with the right team in place,

39:13.142 --> 39:15.261
but she didn't think that Megan
belonged on that team.

39:15.281 --> 39:17.349
Castle: The thought
of being cast aside

39:17.383 --> 39:19.518
- was more than you could bear.
- So you came up with a plan

39:19.552 --> 39:20.918
that would eliminate
your problem

39:20.953 --> 39:22.720
and win your boss
the sympathy of a nation...

39:22.755 --> 39:24.122
two birds with one stone.

39:24.157 --> 39:25.390
Beckett: We got a search warrant

39:25.424 --> 39:27.025
to look into
your apartment, Megan.

39:27.059 --> 39:28.683
The coat that you were wearing

39:28.703 --> 39:31.095
tested positive
for gunshot residue.

39:32.542 --> 39:35.099
You killed Carolyn.

39:35.134 --> 39:38.269
Megan, how...
how could you do that?

39:38.527 --> 39:40.376
How could <i>I?</i>

39:41.430 --> 39:43.274
How could <i>you?</i>

39:43.308 --> 39:44.893
When you started
at city council,

39:44.913 --> 39:46.953
I was putting signs
on people's lawns,

39:46.973 --> 39:50.414
I was passing out pamphlets
in the freezing cold.

39:50.448 --> 39:52.994
I write your speeches.
I craft your bills.

39:53.014 --> 39:55.779
I have invested
my entire life in you,

39:55.799 --> 39:58.950
in doing whatever it is
you need me to do.

39:58.970 --> 40:01.325
And I've done it well.

40:01.675 --> 40:03.494
That should count for something.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.296
Megan Brooks,
you're under arrest

40:05.330 --> 40:07.103
for the murder
of Carolyn Decker.

40:07.123 --> 40:09.332
[Handcuffs click]

40:10.152 --> 40:12.671
Beckett: Backstabbing,
adultery, and betrayal...

40:12.691 --> 40:15.338
that is why I hate politics.

40:15.372 --> 40:17.908
Representatives of the people
should be honorable.

40:17.942 --> 40:19.342
They should be trustworthy.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.677
Well, I'm sure some of them are,

40:20.712 --> 40:22.512
but Washington
could probably use

40:22.546 --> 40:25.565
a few more people
that think the way you do.

40:26.061 --> 40:27.960
What's this?

40:29.647 --> 40:31.321
Oh, study materials.

40:31.355 --> 40:32.922
For the captain's exam.

40:32.956 --> 40:35.111
- So you're gonna go for it?
- Well, it's the next step.

40:35.131 --> 40:36.992
I'm not sure
if it's the right one yet,

40:37.027 --> 40:38.809
but I figured I'd take the test,
see how I do.

40:38.829 --> 40:40.529
And if you do well?

40:40.563 --> 40:42.531
Then maybe that'll make
my decision for me.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.356
- You ready to go home?
- Yeah.

40:50.338 --> 40:52.346
[Sighs]
What am I gonna tell her?

40:52.557 --> 40:55.377
The only thing you can...
the truth.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.017
I messed everything up.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.847
Even with a plea deal,
I'm going to jail.

40:58.881 --> 41:01.049
No, you don't know that.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.784
[Sighing]

41:06.014 --> 41:08.124
Gwen's gonna hate me...

41:08.310 --> 41:10.283
for lying...

41:10.693 --> 41:12.899
And for not being the man
I said I was.

41:12.919 --> 41:17.218
She's strong, Frank.
Stronger than you think.

41:23.383 --> 41:26.474
I don't know if I should knock
or just open the door.

41:34.528 --> 41:36.817
I'm sorry, Gwennie.

41:37.109 --> 41:39.820
[Voice breaking] I'm so sorry.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.424
[Sighs] We'll get
through it, baby.

41:43.458 --> 41:45.692
We'll figure it out.

41:57.398 --> 41:59.006
[Door closes]

42:08.347 --> 42:09.462
Wait a minute. I think I know
this guy.

42:09.482 --> 42:11.909
He's the personal injury
attorney on TV.

42:13.351 --> 42:14.892
You're right that's uh...

42:14.912 --> 42:15.843
The Pitbull.

42:15.863 --> 42:18.002
You been in an accident? Take
the law by the tail.

42:18.022 --> 42:20.414
There's nothin' he wouldn't do
for a price.

42:20.434 --> 42:22.437
And I mean nothin'.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.026
Hey!

42:23.046 --> 42:26.558
What's a former mvp doing with
our ambulance chasing Pitbull?

42:26.578 --> 42:28.064
Ya! Ahhh!

42:28.165 --> 42:29.232
You just got benched.

42:29.333 --> 42:30.504
[Shotgun cocking]

42:30.524 --> 42:33.203
I think we may just have dug our
own graves.
