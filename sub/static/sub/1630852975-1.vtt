00:34.160 --> 00:35.787
<i>Rule #1:</i>

00:36.788 --> 00:39.791
<i>Make sure you know everything
about those you visit.</i>

00:41.000 --> 00:44.504
<i>2: Never spend more than 10 minutes.</i>

00:44.671 --> 00:47.924
<i>Every extra minute increases the chance
of someone returning home unexpectedly.</i>

00:51.344 --> 00:53.555
<i>3: Do not leave any DNA traces.</i>

00:59.310 --> 01:03.064
<i>4: Don't waste time getting
an expensive reproduction.</i>

01:03.231 --> 01:06.985
<i>Even a simple forgery will
go unnoticed for weeks.</i>

01:09.571 --> 01:14.117
<i>5: Sooner or later,
one of two things will happen.</i>

01:14.284 --> 01:19.038
<i>You find a work of art so valuable
that you never need to worry again...</i>

01:19.205 --> 01:20.498
<i>or...</i>

01:20.665 --> 01:21.958
<i>you'll get caught.</i>

01:22.125 --> 01:25.295
HEADHUNTERS

01:48.651 --> 01:50.570
<i>My name is Roger Brown.</i>

01:50.737 --> 01:52.489
<i>I'm 5'6" tall.</i>

01:52.655 --> 01:55.909
<i>You don't need a Ph.D to realize
that I overcompensate for my height.</i>

01:58.411 --> 02:02.123
<i>For instance,
my house is worth 30 million kroner.</i>

02:02.290 --> 02:04.834
<i>I don't like it
and I can't afford it. But she...</i>

02:05.001 --> 02:06.377
Of course you have to come!

02:06.544 --> 02:07.921
<i>She loved it.</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:10.840
How often does one
of your girlfriends open a gallery?

02:11.007 --> 02:14.010
<i>I told her
I had inherited the money.</i>

02:14.177 --> 02:16.554
<i>I had to give her
some kind of explanation.</i>

02:16.721 --> 02:18.431
<i>But all I've inherited is bad genes.</i>

02:18.598 --> 02:22.352
We've gone through a long and intricate
process to reach the truth in this case.

02:22.519 --> 02:25.897
<i>For someone like me to get
what he wants, only one thing matters...</i>

02:26.064 --> 02:27.565
<i>Money.</i>

02:27.732 --> 02:28.775
Go ahead, open it.

02:28.942 --> 02:30.568
<i>Lots of money.</i>

02:37.867 --> 02:41.079
<i>But there is one thing
Diana wants more than anything else.</i>

02:42.664 --> 02:45.208
<i>And that is exactly the one thing
I do not want to give her.</i>

02:48.753 --> 02:51.381
- Isn't she cute?
- Real cute.

02:55.885 --> 02:59.097
<i>You see, Diana StrÃ¸m-Eliassen is
one of those tall, smart beauties.</i>

02:59.264 --> 03:00.682
Hi, guys! The large paintings go
to the back, okay?

03:00.849 --> 03:05.228
<i>The type used to being loved.
The type who take love for granted.</i>

03:06.229 --> 03:08.648
<i>And there are plenty of men
who would love her.</i>

03:08.815 --> 03:10.692
<i>Men taller than 5'6".</i>

03:15.822 --> 03:17.699
<i>But soon my time will come.</i>

03:17.866 --> 03:21.411
<i>My opportunity. I can feel it.</i>

03:21.578 --> 03:22.996
<i>In the meantime,
I play for high stakes.</i>

03:23.162 --> 03:26.207
<i>If you don't gamble, you don't win.</i>

03:31.254 --> 03:33.131
What are your plans for tomorrow?

03:33.298 --> 03:35.675
- Why?
- We have a dinner invitation.

03:37.719 --> 03:39.262
We're invited to dinner.

03:40.972 --> 03:42.181
We are invited to dinner?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.058
Yes. There's someone
I want you to meet.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.185
Are you telling others about us, Lotte?

03:46.352 --> 03:48.187
There's just someone
I'd like you to meet.

03:48.354 --> 03:52.233
This ends right here and now.
I'm really sorry about it.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.528
- Please don't.
- No no no, Lotte!

03:56.696 --> 03:59.657
- You and me do not exist.
- Please stop it.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.503
An impressive resumÃ©
you've got here, Lander.

04:12.670 --> 04:16.466
Thank you. Yes, I believe
I'm the right man for Pathfinder.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.386
I would like to hear a bit about
your life outside the job as well.

04:20.553 --> 04:22.055
Is there such a thing?

04:24.557 --> 04:28.478
So you live here in Oslo?
And are married to? Thank you, Oda.

04:28.645 --> 04:31.105
Camilla.
We've been married for nine years.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.191
- Two kids. They are in school.
- Does she hold a job?

04:33.358 --> 04:35.318
Yes. At a downtown law firm.

04:35.485 --> 04:38.655
Nine-to-five, every day?
Who stays home if the children fall ill?

04:38.821 --> 04:40.114
She does, of course.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.283
So there's no maid
at home during the day?

04:42.450 --> 04:43.451
- No.
- Dog?

04:43.618 --> 04:45.787
- Do we have a dog? No.
- No? Allergic?

04:45.954 --> 04:47.246
No.

04:59.509 --> 05:02.303
How much would you consider that your
reputation as a leader is worth, Lander?

05:02.470 --> 05:05.390
My... reputation?
What do you mean?

05:06.849 --> 05:08.810
This work is by Julian Opie

05:08.977 --> 05:10.269
and is worth a quarter of a million.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.896
Do you own any art
in the same price range?

05:12.063 --> 05:13.606
Actually, yes.

05:13.773 --> 05:17.026
A Munch lithograph.
"The Brooch."

05:17.193 --> 05:19.278
Could you estimate
its value just by looking at it?

05:19.445 --> 05:21.280
- Well, I'm not sure.
- You're not sure.

05:21.447 --> 05:24.033
This one, for instance,
consists of a few circles and lines.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.827
The coloration is monotone
and without texture.

05:25.994 --> 05:28.663
The only thing--
I repeat, the only thing--

05:28.830 --> 05:30.915
that makes this work worth
a quarter of a million

05:31.082 --> 05:32.583
is the artist's reputation.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.794
And your point is
the same thing goes for leaders?

05:34.961 --> 05:36.504
Exactly.

05:38.923 --> 05:41.426
Which is why
you will not take this job.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.848
- What?
- My God. You applied for it yourself.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.354
What else was I supposed to do?

05:53.521 --> 05:56.149
You should have had
someone tip us off to you

05:56.315 --> 05:58.192
and then pretended you didn't know
about it when we got in touch.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.736
But...

05:59.902 --> 06:01.988
It's all a game, Lander.

06:03.239 --> 06:06.200
Listen. Pathfinder's chairman
and finance manager

06:06.367 --> 06:08.411
will be here tomorrow,
and I'd like you to meet them.

06:08.578 --> 06:10.705
You're going to listen politely to them,

06:10.872 --> 06:13.541
then you will explain
why you are no longer interested

06:13.708 --> 06:17.003
- and wish them good luck.
- But I would not seem serious.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.881
No. They will see you as ambitious,

06:20.048 --> 06:22.008
as someone who knows his own worth.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.012
Lander...

06:27.972 --> 06:30.058
- This is your opportunity.
- Opportunity?

06:30.224 --> 06:32.810
Let me build your reputation

06:34.520 --> 06:37.732
and I promise you a position which
quintuples your income within two years.

06:37.899 --> 06:39.776
- Within two years?
- Within two years.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.819
How can you promise this?

06:41.986 --> 06:46.032
Because I have never given a client
a recommendation he hasn't followed.

06:46.199 --> 06:48.951
- Never?
- Never.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.953
But how?

06:51.120 --> 06:52.997
The answer starts with an "R."

06:53.164 --> 06:57.460
- Reputation?
- My entire career is based on it.

07:00.046 --> 07:01.506
Hi.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.468
- Yes?
- I set you up for the interview

07:05.635 --> 07:08.096
with Jeremias Lander and Pathfinder
tomorrow at 12 o'clock.

07:09.097 --> 07:11.641
- The information is in the file.
- Great.

07:11.808 --> 07:13.476
But listen,

07:13.643 --> 07:17.563
your wife is opening her gallery
this weekend, and I wondered...

07:17.730 --> 07:19.857
could I attend?

07:20.024 --> 07:22.485
- Are you invited?
- Exactly my question!

07:22.652 --> 07:25.154
- Am I?
- Are you?

07:25.321 --> 07:28.449
<i>I got an invoice of 357,000</i>

07:28.616 --> 07:30.576
<i>for redecoration
in Kasper Hansen Street.</i>

07:30.743 --> 07:32.912
- Yes, that's correct.
- <i>Well, what's that about?</i>

07:33.079 --> 07:36.916
I helped Diana with some expenses.
She opens her own gallery on Friday.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.294
<i>You have to start cutting down
on your expenses, Roger.</i>

07:40.461 --> 07:42.463
<i>You may go bankrupt at any time.</i>

07:42.630 --> 07:44.340
I'm working on it, Frode.
I'm working on it.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.592
<i>As your accountant,
it's my duty to inform you</i>

07:46.759 --> 07:48.553
<i>about the seriousness
of the situation.</i>

07:48.719 --> 07:52.473
<i>You have overdrawn your account by
several hundred thousands for dinners...</i>

07:52.640 --> 07:55.268
There's a call coming in here.
I'll call you later.

07:56.519 --> 07:59.772
We have a candidate.
Jeremias Lander, lives at SkÃ¸yen.

08:03.943 --> 08:06.612
Okay. Got him. When?

08:06.779 --> 08:09.157
He has a meeting at Alfa tomorrow at 12.
It will last one hour.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.368
- <i>Nobody home?</i>
- No dog, no maid, wife works downtown.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.245
See you in 20 minutes.

09:44.794 --> 09:46.837
<i>The fence in Gothenburg demanded 50%.</i>

09:48.089 --> 09:50.883
<i>Ove Kjikerud charged 20%
to disconnect alarms,</i>

09:51.050 --> 09:53.511
<i>fetch the art in my garage,
and bring it to Sweden by car.</i>

09:53.678 --> 09:58.099
<i>To get him employed at Tripolis was
one of my smartest moves.</i>

09:58.266 --> 10:00.476
<i>I myself was left with 80,000.</i>

10:00.643 --> 10:02.353
<i>80,000.</i>

10:02.520 --> 10:05.398
<i>Not even enough for my next
quarterly payment on my house.</i>

10:06.899 --> 10:08.526
<i>Something had to be done.</i>

10:13.823 --> 10:15.533
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.035
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

10:29.839 --> 10:31.632
It's looking real good.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.010
Not even half of the guests
have arrived yet.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.554
But I don't have the time
to greet anyone either because...

10:36.721 --> 10:39.265
Listen, it's going just fine.

10:39.432 --> 10:42.768
- Congratulations. Fantastic exhibition.
- Thank you.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.271
- Something crazy happened today.
- Like what?

10:45.438 --> 10:48.149
I cannot tell you now,
but I want you to meet him.

10:48.316 --> 10:49.650
Meet who?

11:07.918 --> 11:09.879
So this is my husband, Roger Brown.

11:10.046 --> 11:11.464
- Clas Greve.
- Nice to meet you.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.008
Clas just moved here
from the Netherlands.

11:14.175 --> 11:17.178
Excuse me.
Hi, are you on your way?

11:18.220 --> 11:21.682
No, a few screaming kids
just liven up the party...

11:24.769 --> 11:26.479
So what brings you to Norway? Work?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.773
No. I inherited
my grandmother's apartment.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.566
- She was Norwegian?
- Yes.

11:30.733 --> 11:34.528
And a few months ago,
I chose to go into early retirement.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.155
So now I've moved here

11:36.322 --> 11:37.865
- to redecorate the apartment.
- So you retired?

11:38.032 --> 11:39.283
- Yes.
- From what?

11:39.450 --> 11:42.620
I was the CEO
of a Dutch technology company.

11:42.787 --> 11:46.624
I work with GPS sales.

11:46.791 --> 11:49.251
Dutch? Not HOTE, by any chance?

11:49.418 --> 11:50.711
Yes, exactly.

11:50.878 --> 11:55.007
Weren't they just bought up
by a large American company? Amtech?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.761
- You are also in the business?
- No.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.014
But why did you quit?
Isn't it exciting?

12:02.181 --> 12:03.724
I won't bore you with job chatter.

12:03.891 --> 12:07.645
I'm in the recruitment business.
You won't bore me with job chatter.

12:09.397 --> 12:11.399
Are you familiar with Pathfinder?

12:11.565 --> 12:14.860
Yes, of course.
They were our competitors.

12:15.861 --> 12:19.448
Roger, I'm sorry, I have to go.
But enjoy the rest of your evening.

12:19.615 --> 12:23.452
Clas! Pathfinder seeks a new manager.

12:23.619 --> 12:26.789
Someone who can stand up
against foreign takeovers.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.791
- How about a meeting?
- Sorry, Roger.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.877
Then let's have lunch.
Monday at 12:00.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.880
We could drop the job chatter
and talk about other things...

12:35.047 --> 12:37.591
art, redecoration,
Polish handymen.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.469
Could I have a pen?
I'll write down the restaurant's name.

12:40.636 --> 12:41.971
You're not used to being turned down?

12:45.474 --> 12:48.644
A farewell present
for long and faithful service?

12:48.811 --> 12:50.896
No, I stole it.

12:54.358 --> 12:57.695
See you then.
Give my regards to your charming wife.

12:57.862 --> 12:59.447
I will.

13:09.915 --> 13:14.128
- This is my husband.
- Roger Brown. Nice to meet you.

13:14.295 --> 13:17.506
- Brede Sperre, Kripos.
- Yes, we've seen you on TV.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.758
He investigates
art burglaries now.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.469
I thought you investigated murders.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.305
Yes, but this is getting so big
that we sent in all our resources.

13:24.472 --> 13:27.641
We're going to stop this now.
Are you in the art business as well?

13:27.808 --> 13:32.104
No, I work as a headhunter.
In the recruitment business, for Alfa.

13:32.271 --> 13:34.398
I see. One of the partners.

13:34.565 --> 13:35.608
What do you mean?

13:35.774 --> 13:39.403
Well, I complimented your wife here
on her expensive earrings.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.322
She said they were
a present from you.

13:41.489 --> 13:43.115
Yes.

13:44.325 --> 13:46.660
The best of us
get good bonus deals.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.626
I wish we had those
in my line of work as well.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.127
- Sperre?
- Yes?

13:55.294 --> 13:57.296
We're from VG.
Could we have a photo?

13:57.463 --> 13:59.173
Of course.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.889
Hi. How nice of you to come.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.612
Roger? Are you coming?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.369
Look at this.

14:28.536 --> 14:31.539
"The Calydonian Boar Hunt,"
by Rubens.

14:31.705 --> 14:36.210
It was stolen when the Germans looted
the gallery in Antwerp in 1941.

14:36.377 --> 14:40.089
It's been missing ever since.
Do you know where it is now?

14:40.256 --> 14:41.298
No.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.260
In Clas Grave's apartment
in Oscar Street.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.763
- What?
- Clas Grave's grandmother had

14:47.930 --> 14:51.183
a secret love affair
with a German officer during the war.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.436
But he was arrested
and shot a few days later.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.231
She panicked, fearing someone
would discover the relationship.

14:57.398 --> 14:59.358
And then she hid the painting?

14:59.525 --> 15:02.528
- Yes, something of the sort.
- Oh well, but it's not genuine.

15:02.695 --> 15:06.031
I don't think German officers
collected reproductions, Roger.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.118
Well, why did he tell you about it?

15:09.285 --> 15:12.288
He came by the gallery
to ask if I could evaluate it

15:12.454 --> 15:14.206
or if I knew someone who could.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.503
You're saying that
Clas Greve has a genuine Rubens

15:19.670 --> 15:20.963
hanging in his apartment
in Oscar Street?

15:21.130 --> 15:22.131
- Yes.
- Here in Oslo?

15:22.298 --> 15:27.052
Yes. But I offered
to contact an art museum

15:27.219 --> 15:30.222
to have it moved as soon as possible.
Next week.

15:30.389 --> 15:34.226
You don't place a painting
like this in a safe-deposit box.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.396
How much do you think it's worth?

15:38.564 --> 15:42.234
Tens of millions.
Maybe a hundred.

15:49.241 --> 15:53.454
Do you know what I think?
I think we should celebrate.

15:53.621 --> 15:56.665
Celebrate what?

15:56.832 --> 16:01.378
That you opened your own gallery.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.798
And the two of us.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.301
Thanks for supporting me, Roger.

16:07.468 --> 16:10.095
Everything is going to be fine.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.222
What do you mean?

16:13.307 --> 16:17.227
That you and I should
start thinking about the future.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.869
- Ove here.
- <i>We have a candidate.</i>

16:34.036 --> 16:35.329
Do you know what the time is?

16:35.496 --> 16:38.916
<i>His name is Clas Greve.
He lives in 25 Oscar Street.</i>

16:39.083 --> 16:40.834
What, he is grave?

16:41.001 --> 16:42.753
No, his name is Greve.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.382
Ove?

16:49.968 --> 16:51.428
Ove, what's happening? Ove?

16:51.595 --> 16:53.931
Sorry. Natasha is here.

16:54.098 --> 16:55.641
Come again?

16:55.808 --> 16:57.267
<i>Meet me at the cabin tomorrow.</i>

16:57.434 --> 16:59.687
No, not tomorrow! It's Saturday.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.563
I've got her for the whole weekend.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.399
We want to do something nice.
Not tomorrow.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.318
This is a big deal, Ove.
We only have a couple of days.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.324
- <i>One o'clock!</i>
- Yes, okay.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.006
- You are so sweet.
- Good morning.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.348
- Listen.
- Yes?

17:37.474 --> 17:39.143
What you said yesterday
about the future.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.854
- Yes?
- Does it include the sound

17:42.020 --> 17:45.482
of tiny feet
shuffling along these corridors?

17:46.483 --> 17:49.820
- Maybe.
- Don't give me "maybe," Roger.

17:52.990 --> 17:55.033
I told you yesterday
that everything will be fine,

17:55.200 --> 17:57.745
- and it will.
- But I want that conversation now.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.122
Definitely, but I have
an important meeting first.

18:01.749 --> 18:03.917
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Hmm?

18:04.084 --> 18:06.795
- You have an important meeting?
- Yes.

18:07.838 --> 18:10.090
A meeting that was
set up during the night?

18:10.257 --> 18:13.051
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

18:16.555 --> 18:19.057
- What are you so scared of?
- Nothing.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.435
I'm scared of dogs
and you when you are like this.

18:21.602 --> 18:22.644
Don't just make jokes about it.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.730
If you want us to be childless
the rest of our lives,

18:24.897 --> 18:26.064
I would really like to know.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.025
Didn't you hear me?
We'll have the conversation,

18:28.192 --> 18:29.943
but not now because I have
an important meeting.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.279
I've tried to talk about this
for seven years, Roger.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.574
And it will take another seven years
if you keep nagging this way.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.829
I didn't mean that.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.541
You will never give me a child.

19:03.060 --> 19:06.313
So... how many millions
are we talking about?

19:08.148 --> 19:09.274
Maybe up to a hundred.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.610
A hundred?

19:14.655 --> 19:17.032
- This happens every time, Ove.
- Eh?

19:17.199 --> 19:18.659
I've told you I don't like
those things lying around.

19:18.826 --> 19:22.329
Don't start again.
You know I always carry weapons.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.957
At home, I've got weapons everywhere.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.626
Got a gun within reach in every room.

19:28.669 --> 19:32.422
You should get one as well.
Sooner or later they'll be coming.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.258
We do it this way:

19:34.424 --> 19:36.885
You go to Gothenburg
and get a reproduction.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.054
There are many available,
but we need a good one.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.390
I have lunch with Clas Greve on Monday.
Then I will get...

19:41.557 --> 19:42.891
Ove?

19:56.113 --> 19:57.489
Women.

19:58.991 --> 20:02.786
Like I tried to say before I was
interrupted by a Russian prostitute,

20:04.204 --> 20:06.248
I have lunch with Greve on Monday.

20:06.415 --> 20:08.083
I'll find out then
when the apartment is empty,

20:08.250 --> 20:10.294
so that I can fetch the painting.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.005
You go to Sweden immediately. Now.

20:13.171 --> 20:16.133
Okay. No, shit, I can't.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.385
- What?
- I'm busy.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.053
- Busy?
- Natasha is here.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.681
I'm making a film with her
before she goes back.

20:22.848 --> 20:24.349
Film?

20:24.516 --> 20:26.059
I've arranged everything
with the guys at work.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.062
- They've changed shifts and everything.
- You're filming her?

20:29.229 --> 20:31.815
It's such a long time between her
visits, so I need something to watch.

20:36.111 --> 20:39.197
I just activate the alarm,
and the cameras start rolling.

20:42.034 --> 20:44.703
- She doesn't know you're filming her?
- No way.

20:44.870 --> 20:48.040
And the Tripolis guards?
They are watching the two of you?

20:48.206 --> 20:50.375
The cameras are not directed
towards the bed!

20:50.542 --> 20:52.210
What do you take me for?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.504
They see her undress

20:54.671 --> 20:57.257
and a bit of fingering.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.347
She's cut her hair. Looks nice.

21:03.513 --> 21:07.434
The rest is private. Cool, eh?

21:11.396 --> 21:14.191
The painting will be removed from
the apartment in just a few days, Ove.

21:14.358 --> 21:16.568
Do you realize how big this is?

21:16.735 --> 21:18.862
She is here twice in six months.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.572
You'll be left with millions.

21:22.366 --> 21:25.410
With that kind of money
you can buy her.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.080
For the rest of your life.

22:06.368 --> 22:09.454
I'll have one without scampi jelly,
and dressing on the side.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.331
As you wish. Thank you.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.293
Will you settle in Oslo now
or will you do a lot of commuting?

22:18.755 --> 22:21.550
Three and a half million,
plus stock options.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.345
I'm afraid you take things
for granted, Greve.

22:25.512 --> 22:29.558
Don't forget you're a foreigner.
Norwegian companies would like...

22:29.725 --> 22:33.437
Roger. I don't doubt that your methods
will work on most people.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.188
And I respect that, of course.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.899
But we have both been
in this situation before.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.486
- You practically dribbled over me on...
- Dribbled?

22:41.653 --> 22:45.240
You drooled when we met at the gallery,
and with good reason.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.160
On that occasion, the problem
was not that I was a foreigner,

22:48.326 --> 22:50.203
but that I was not interested in a job.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.956
But you get to reflect a lot
during a weekend, and I concluded

22:53.123 --> 22:56.168
that redecoration is not
that interesting in the long run.

22:56.334 --> 23:00.505
So if it's okay with you,
why don't we simply drop the charade?

23:05.302 --> 23:06.803
I surrender.

23:08.889 --> 23:11.183
But I still need more data on you.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.518
- For my client.
- Do you play squash?

23:24.279 --> 23:25.280
Are you married?

23:25.447 --> 23:27.240
- Divorced.
- Children?

23:27.407 --> 23:28.950
- Unfortunately not.
- Dog?

23:29.117 --> 23:30.660
Yes.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.705
I've got one.
He is in Amsterdam.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.333
- In quarantine?
- I'll fly down to get him tomorrow.

23:44.758 --> 23:47.344
The GPS business is a tough one?

23:47.511 --> 23:49.805
- Your back.
- Oh.

23:49.971 --> 23:53.350
- That's from the army.
- The army?

23:53.517 --> 23:55.894
I enrolled when I was 18.

23:56.978 --> 24:00.565
After a few years I was enlisted
in an elite unit which specialized...

24:00.732 --> 24:03.568
- Specialized in what?
- Tracking.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.988
- Tracking of?
- People.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.782
Missing people, fugitives.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.368
And the technology came from HOTE?

24:11.535 --> 24:13.411
Exactly.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.581
They produced
microscopic transmitters.

24:16.748 --> 24:21.461
I had some ideas for improvements,
so they recruited me.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.840
Where did you get those scars?

24:25.006 --> 24:26.550
Bolivia.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.760
And how?
Were you tortured or what?

24:28.927 --> 24:31.138
No, I was lucky.
I got out in time.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.390
Sounds like something from a film.

24:33.557 --> 24:35.892
Believe me, Roger.
You've never seen this on film.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.604
When do you think we can arrange
a meeting with Pathfinder?

24:39.771 --> 24:43.275
Any time.
When are you back from Amsterdam?

24:43.441 --> 24:45.402
- The day after tomorrow.
- Let's do it then.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.908
Diana?

24:55.579 --> 24:59.541
<i>Out with customers
Back late</i>

28:05.101 --> 28:08.605
No, Murphy. Come here.

28:41.721 --> 28:44.182
<i>Hit the ring, hit the ring!</i>

28:44.349 --> 28:47.644
<i>Hit the one you want,
hit the one you love.</i>

30:07.640 --> 30:10.477
<i>Hi, this is Diana.
I can't answer the phone right now,</i>

30:10.643 --> 30:13.563
<i>but you know what to do
after the beep. Have a nice day.</i>

31:09.702 --> 31:11.829
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:11.996 --> 31:15.291
- You're so late.
- I tried to call your cellphone.

31:15.458 --> 31:18.461
Right. I can't find it.
I must have left it at the gallery.

31:20.255 --> 31:21.673
Was there anything urgent?

31:21.839 --> 31:23.091
No.

31:25.969 --> 31:28.888
I just wanted to hear your voice.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.890
That's sweet.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.768
Come and sit down.
This film just started.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.395
No.

31:36.479 --> 31:40.692
I'm beat.

31:40.858 --> 31:42.610
I'm going to bed.

31:50.660 --> 31:54.706
We developed this jelly containing
hundreds of transmitters per milliliter.

31:54.872 --> 31:56.416
It adheres to all materials.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.167
It's invisible
and just about impossible to remove.

31:58.334 --> 31:59.919
- You mean Trace.
- Exactly.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.338
The disadvantage is that Trace

32:02.505 --> 32:06.050
is hypersensitive to dirt and mud.

32:06.217 --> 32:09.721
And my personal experience as a soldier
is that when you're stuck in,

32:09.887 --> 32:12.473
pardon my French,
the asshole of the world,

32:12.640 --> 32:15.893
you are dependent on your equipment.

32:19.856 --> 32:23.943
Being introduced by Brown
is obviously of great significance.

32:24.110 --> 32:27.905
In the final stage, he has to
give us his recommendations.

32:30.408 --> 32:32.827
Excuse me for a moment.

32:47.258 --> 32:50.094
Great meeting.
Thanks a lot.

32:50.261 --> 32:51.721
- Really good.
- Thank you so much.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.431
- Take care.
- Thank you.

32:56.225 --> 32:58.311
When will you write
the recommendation?

32:58.478 --> 33:01.689
- We have to make a decision first.
- What was that?

33:02.899 --> 33:05.985
Nothing is decided.
There are other candidates.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.655
We have to consider the total picture.
We will get back to you.

33:08.821 --> 33:11.658
Damn it, Roger,
did we attend the same meeting?

33:12.700 --> 33:13.743
It couldn't have been better.

33:13.910 --> 33:15.578
They were ready
to sign the contract on the spot.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.456
Well, then your chances are good.

33:26.089 --> 33:28.424
- Hi.
- <i>Shit, are you calling on a cellphone?</i>

33:28.591 --> 33:30.885
- You're going to Gothenburg tonight.
- <i>What? Tonight?</i>

33:31.052 --> 33:33.680
The painting has to be traded
for money, as quickly as possible.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.699
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.701
I have to talk to you.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.703
You can't look me up this way, Lotte.

33:56.869 --> 33:58.579
Please, just give me two seconds.

34:14.053 --> 34:17.098
I'm sorry if it's my fault
you're feeling this way.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.728
There's really nothing more
to talk about.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.312
Nothing at all.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.525
Do you need money?

34:27.692 --> 34:29.444
I miss you.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.239
- I miss you so much.
- Lotte.

34:34.407 --> 34:36.324
Lotte.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.911
Don't contact me again.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.349
You look tired.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.143
Thank you.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.855
Anything wrong?

35:06.856 --> 35:08.191
No.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.486
- A lot to do at work?
- Quite a bit.

35:12.487 --> 35:16.282
I had a meeting today with Pathfinder.
And Clas Greve.

35:16.449 --> 35:19.535
- Did it work out fine?
- No.

35:21.704 --> 35:24.832
- He won't get the job?
- Definitely not.

35:24.999 --> 35:27.919
When I get to the office tomorrow,
I'll call all the other agencies

35:28.085 --> 35:30.797
and make sure
he won't get a single job in Norway.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.508
Why is that?

35:34.884 --> 35:37.303
- By the way, did you find your phone?
- Pardon?

35:38.930 --> 35:40.515
Your cellphone.
You said you lost your cellphone.

35:40.681 --> 35:43.100
- Yes, I did.
- Was it in the gallery or what?

35:43.267 --> 35:45.812
- Yes.
- That's great.

35:45.978 --> 35:49.232
- Some more wine?
- Yes. Thank you.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.170
Ove?

36:54.171 --> 36:55.172
Ove?

36:58.217 --> 36:59.343
Ove?

37:24.327 --> 37:25.828
Come here.

38:19.507 --> 38:20.841
Hi.

38:22.510 --> 38:25.596
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

38:28.099 --> 38:30.893
I saw you go down here,
and you didn't come out.

38:31.060 --> 38:33.729
- I got a bit worried.
- About what?

38:33.896 --> 38:35.564
Nothing.

38:37.024 --> 38:38.734
- Roger.
- Yes.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.781
Have a nice day at work.

39:00.506 --> 39:01.882
I love you.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.481
Ove? Ove?

40:53.369 --> 40:55.830
- Ove, where do you live?
- Nathas...

40:55.996 --> 40:58.290
- Not Natasha. Where do you live? Ove?
- Nathas...

40:58.457 --> 41:00.584
Ove? Ove?

41:00.751 --> 41:02.837
Ove? Where do you live?

41:19.562 --> 41:21.397
Ove, what happened in the garage?

41:21.564 --> 41:24.150
Did you see anyone?

41:31.407 --> 41:33.701
Ove, answer me. Ove?

41:33.868 --> 41:35.911
Did you see what happened?
Was there anyone there?

41:36.078 --> 41:38.247
Listen!
Was there anyone there, Ove?

41:38.414 --> 41:41.125
Was there?

41:45.087 --> 41:47.298
What the hell is going on here?

41:47.464 --> 41:50.134
Shit, what's going on?

42:14.283 --> 42:16.202
- Ove, what's the password?
- Eh?

42:16.368 --> 42:17.703
What's the password?

42:17.870 --> 42:20.080
- What's the password for the alarm?
- Nata...

42:20.247 --> 42:21.874
We have to deactivate the alarm.
What's the password?

42:22.041 --> 42:24.293
- Nata...
- Stop going on about her!

42:24.460 --> 42:27.463
- What's the password?
- That's what I'm saying. Natasha!

42:30.341 --> 42:33.177
With "sh" or "sch"?
Ove, "sh" or "sch"?

42:46.774 --> 42:47.942
Ove?

42:51.195 --> 42:53.155
Ove? How is it going?

42:53.322 --> 42:55.908
Ove, how are you doing?

42:56.075 --> 42:59.662
- What happened?
- You sat on a syringe in my car.

42:59.828 --> 43:01.288
A syringe?

43:02.748 --> 43:04.792
- Relax. You were lucky.
- Lucky?!

43:04.959 --> 43:08.128
It must have hit your knee, so that
you didn't absorb all the poison.

43:08.295 --> 43:10.297
- You didn't expose us?
- No way.

43:10.464 --> 43:12.424
- Did you fuck up?
- That's not what this is about!

43:12.591 --> 43:16.553
- You didn't fuck up, did you?
- Diana is having an affair with Clas.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.348
He wouldn't kill you
just because he fucks your wife!

43:27.189 --> 43:30.818
- Call 911!
- We don't want the police here!

43:33.070 --> 43:35.406
Please, Roger.

43:35.572 --> 43:37.992
I need to get to a hospital,
or else I'll die.

43:38.158 --> 43:40.244
- I'll get you some milk.
- Eh?

43:40.411 --> 43:43.163
Milk neutralizes poison. That's what
they would do at the hospital.

43:43.330 --> 43:44.498
Then give me milk!

44:03.350 --> 44:06.103
- Call them.
- Don't do anything stupid, Ove.

44:06.270 --> 44:08.105
Then I'll do it myself.

44:10.899 --> 44:13.610
Just calm down now.

45:58.298 --> 46:01.343
Roger! I would like
to talk to you.

46:14.481 --> 46:18.277
- No!
- Roger?

46:37.546 --> 46:40.841
<i>Our main research interest
was the tracking of people.</i>

46:44.094 --> 46:45.846
<i>Microscopic transmitters.</i>

48:37.165 --> 48:40.043
Hello. I just thought
I'd visit the cabin.

48:40.210 --> 48:42.129
I thought you were Kjikerud.

48:42.296 --> 48:44.590
- No.
- It's his car.

48:44.756 --> 48:46.508
Yes.

48:48.927 --> 48:51.555
Aren't you some kind
of businessman?

48:52.681 --> 48:55.726
I was fired.
May I park the car inside the barn?

48:55.892 --> 48:58.478
- 500 per 24 hours.
- 500?

48:58.645 --> 49:01.690
You could park for free
by the roadside, you know.

49:10.949 --> 49:15.329
If you touch the tractor,
I want compensation!

49:45.359 --> 49:47.861
What a rush of people here today!

49:50.280 --> 49:53.784
- I'm just visiting Roger Brown.
- You mean that businessman?

49:53.950 --> 49:55.202
Yes.

49:56.870 --> 49:59.498
- What do you want from him?
- We have an appointment.

49:59.665 --> 50:03.877
What you're all doing up there
is none of my business,

50:04.044 --> 50:08.006
but he probably didn't invite you
for coffee and cakes in the cabin.

50:08.173 --> 50:09.591
In the cabin?

50:09.758 --> 50:12.678
Yes, and since it's my property,

50:12.844 --> 50:17.557
maybe a slight compensation
would be fair?

53:33.920 --> 53:35.505
Search!

55:27.993 --> 55:29.202
Hello?

58:43.730 --> 58:45.273
Who are you?

58:46.816 --> 58:48.484
Oh shit.

59:57.845 --> 59:59.639
You're not supposed to be out of bed.

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.434
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No.

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:06.479
Get back to bed.
Well, except for the police.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:09.274
- Huh?
- They're waiting in the corridor.

01:00:11.693 --> 01:00:14.237
I told them you should
have your breakfast first.

01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:40.471
Because if you manage to smash
the larynx, you're a good fighter.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:44.726
Experienced. Ever heard
about something called ko-daw-ying?

01:00:45.768 --> 01:00:49.480
No wonder. Do you know
how many martial arts there are?

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:52.483
Three thousand. Three thousand.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.925
You've got wushu,
martial arts from China.

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:21.512
Tahtib, Egyptian stick fighting.

01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:24.932
That's him! That's him.
He's running away!

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:26.684
Hey! Hey!

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.901
Freeze! Freeze!

01:01:35.068 --> 01:01:37.362
Sunded, I've got him!

01:01:38.613 --> 01:01:42.033
Hi. My name is Olav Sunded,
from Kripos.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.411
You are a suspect in the murder
of the farmer Sindre Aa.

01:01:45.578 --> 01:01:48.289
Come with us, Kjikerud, and we'll go
through the rest at the station.

01:01:49.499 --> 01:01:50.750
What?

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:52.794
You are Ove Kjikerud?

01:01:54.629 --> 01:01:56.214
Yes.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.653
Where are we going?

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:21.614
We're going to Elverum Police Station,
for questioning.

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:25.451
And I hope you cooperate, so that
I can go back home to Oslo tomorrow.

01:02:25.618 --> 01:02:28.121
<i>Attention all patrol cars.</i>

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:29.789
In other words, both of them.

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:33.167
Bravo 3-0 here.

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:36.003
<i>Egmon Karlsen has reported
his truck stolen.</i>

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:38.631
Did Karlsen sound sober? Over.

01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:40.675
<i>Not exactly. Over.</i>

01:02:40.842 --> 01:02:43.553
Call Bamse Pub.
It's probably parked there. Over.

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:45.763
Maybe it's parked behind Kiwi.

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:47.849
Why did you kill
the farmer, Kjikerud?

01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:49.517
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:02:49.684 --> 01:02:51.060
Don't even try.

01:02:51.227 --> 01:02:54.105
Your Mercedes was parked
in Sindre Aa's barn,

01:02:54.272 --> 01:02:56.065
and you drove
his tractor into a ditch.

01:02:56.232 --> 01:02:58.776
- I've never heard that name.
- We have several witnesses who saw...

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:00.611
<i>There is no truck
parked outside Bamse Pub.</i>

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:03.573
No, but I've got
more urgent matters now. Over and out.

01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:06.534
- But, Kjikerud...
- Maybe you could check behind Kiwi.

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:12.206
- We have several witnesses who...
- Damn, there it is!

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:15.877
Brugd here. Call Egmon.
I can see his truck now.

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:19.505
Probably his son stole it again. Over.

01:03:20.506 --> 01:03:22.383
What are you doing, Brugd?

01:03:29.474 --> 01:03:33.186
Well, like I said, Kjikerud,
we have plenty of evidence,

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:35.646
and still you deny everything.

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:40.276
So start feeding me details,
because you lost me completely.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:48.326
Aa's neighbor found you
in the ditch beside the tractor.

01:03:48.493 --> 01:03:52.121
<i>We developed this jelly containing
hundreds of transmitters per milliliter.</i>

01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:53.789
<i>It adheres to all materials.</i>

01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:55.625
<i>It's invisible,
and just about impossible to remove.</i>

01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:57.251
<i>I love you.</i>

01:04:01.172 --> 01:04:04.217
You just sit there repeating
the same thing over and over again.

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:06.677
- We have to get out.
- No, we don't have to get out.

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:09.388
- He's going to kill us all.
- Relax, Kjikerud.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:11.390
He has rubbed
transmitters into my hair!

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:13.726
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- We have to get out!

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.686
- Calm down.
- He wants to kill me!

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.522
He rubbed transmitters into my hair!

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.398
We have to get out!

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.859
- He's going to kill me!
- Calm down!

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.738
- We have to get out!
- No, we don't have to get out.

01:10:55.461 --> 01:10:57.171
<i>Hi, this is Diana.</i>

01:10:58.464 --> 01:11:00.966
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:03.427
<i>Roger? Is that you?</i>

01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:44.426
After finishing here,
we go to Forensic.

01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:45.636
- Yes.
- And then we'll have

01:11:45.803 --> 01:11:47.346
a look at Kjikerud's house.

01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:50.391
Eh?

01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:55.896
"Hi, I'm a single girl from GjÃ¸vik.

01:11:56.063 --> 01:11:59.942
I think you are Norway's
most sexy policeman, and the best.

01:12:00.109 --> 01:12:02.903
Would you like to meet me?
I agree to just about anything."

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:20.462
What the hell happened here?

01:12:28.012 --> 01:12:30.055
Lotte, wait. Wait.

01:12:30.222 --> 01:12:32.224
- What are you doing here?
- Please let me in.

01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:35.269
- What happened to you?
- I need help. Please.

01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:39.314
Thank you.

01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:41.608
I don't mean to involve you in this.

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:43.027
In what?

01:12:45.029 --> 01:12:46.905
When they ask, don't lie.

01:12:47.072 --> 01:12:49.533
Just tell them I was here.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.456
Tell them I forced my way in.

01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:57.291
What happened?

01:12:59.001 --> 01:13:00.377
Wait here, okay?

01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:02.880
I'll get something to clean it with.

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:10.846
Have you got a pair of scissors?

01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:41.043
Lotte, who are you contacting?

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.961
- Give me that phone!
- Ow!

01:13:43.128 --> 01:13:45.631
- Give me that phone!
- Stop it. Stop.

01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:47.800
"Roger is alive.
He is in my apartment now."

01:13:47.966 --> 01:13:49.843
It's not what you think!

01:13:50.969 --> 01:13:52.805
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:55.641
- Answer me! Answer me!
- No, I don't know. I don't know.

01:13:55.808 --> 01:13:57.768
- What's happening?
- It's not my fault!

01:13:57.935 --> 01:13:59.394
What's going on?

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:02.147
- Please.
- What does Greve want from me?

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.985
- It's the Pathfinder job.
- You don't kill people for a job!

01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:10.572
It's about billions, okay?

01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:13.742
They've been working on this for months,
ever since they found out that

01:14:13.909 --> 01:14:16.286
- Pathfinder is looking for a new CEO.
- Who are they?

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:19.790
- Who are "they"?!
- Clas.

01:14:19.957 --> 01:14:21.834
He still works for HOTE.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.710
What?

01:14:25.921 --> 01:14:29.591
- What?
- They have massive economic problems.

01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:32.010
Amtech can save them.

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:34.304
They demand that HOTE provide them
with Pathfinders' technology.

01:14:34.471 --> 01:14:37.224
- This was Clas' assignment.
- Are you all insane?

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:45.274
I was to get to know you,
then introduce you to him.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.402
But he found a new plan, when you
suddenly didn't want to see me anymore.

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:52.239
- What plan?
- He had to find a way to meet you.

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:58.162
His grandmother had an old reproduction
of a Rubens painting.

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.247
So he made up a wild story

01:15:00.414 --> 01:15:03.167
that she had gotten it
from a German officer during the war.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:07.588
He looked up Diana and told her
the story, and she believed him.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:09.965
Then he met you.

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:16.263
The only thing I've done
is rub transmitters into your hair.

01:15:18.432 --> 01:15:19.933
Did you do that?

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:23.729
Did you smear
that shit into my hair?

01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:26.565
- Diana?
- Huh?

01:15:26.732 --> 01:15:29.234
- Is Diana involved in this?
- I don't know, but I think so.

01:15:29.401 --> 01:15:31.403
- You think so?
- It's not my fault!

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:34.573
I didn't want this to happen!

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:42.831
I just want to get away from him.

01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:45.542
Please help me.

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.015
May I have a glass of water?

01:16:31.922 --> 01:16:34.341
Lotte! Lotte!

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:30.605
<i>The suspect in the farmer murder case
died in the accident,</i>

01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:33.984
<i>with three of the four police officers.</i>

01:17:34.151 --> 01:17:37.321
<i>The last police officer
is still missing.</i>

01:17:37.487 --> 01:17:41.742
<i>Military divers are now searching
in and along the river at the site.</i>

01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:43.869
<i>Now to the Middle East, where...</i>

01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:00.594
Diana.

01:18:10.187 --> 01:18:12.064
Roger?

01:18:13.357 --> 01:18:15.317
What happened?

01:18:17.778 --> 01:18:18.945
Are you okay?

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:25.952
Don't look at me that way.

01:18:29.539 --> 01:18:31.416
I know why you left.

01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:34.628
There's nothing more
between Clas and me now. I promise.

01:18:34.795 --> 01:18:37.339
I tried to tell you in the garage,
but I couldn't.

01:18:37.506 --> 01:18:39.257
- And then you just disappeared.
- Diana, what do you know

01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:41.385
- about everything that happened?
- No, I have to tell you this now.

01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.263
I didn't want it to happen,

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.808
but you hurt me,

01:18:49.518 --> 01:18:51.978
he was so easy to talk to

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:55.440
and I couldn't stand it anymore.

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:05.325
It was wrong, and I'm so ashamed.

01:19:08.537 --> 01:19:10.705
Because you are the one I want.

01:19:10.872 --> 01:19:15.168
If you really think we shouldn't
have children, we don't need to.

01:19:18.922 --> 01:19:20.799
I'm willing to do anything.

01:19:26.513 --> 01:19:28.348
You really do love me.

01:19:29.558 --> 01:19:32.519
You must never doubt that.
Promise me.

01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:36.314
And you didn't know anything?

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:41.778
- About what?
- You didn't know anything.

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:51.913
Oh my God. What has happened?

01:20:22.402 --> 01:20:23.987
Come here.

01:20:32.621 --> 01:20:36.958
Dog bites are very serious, Roger.
You have to see a doctor.

01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:38.960
It's not that convenient right now.

01:20:42.172 --> 01:20:43.673
Hold this.

01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:50.138
What are you planning to do now?

01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:52.807
I don't know.

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:59.564
They'll soon find out
who died in the accident.

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:04.528
I have to remove evidence.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.074
And then?

01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:15.205
I have to get away from here.

01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:19.668
Make a new start.

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:25.674
Maybe we...

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.551
maybe you and I could...

01:21:39.521 --> 01:21:41.356
I can wait awhile
before I report it stolen.

01:21:47.571 --> 01:21:49.948
I have to clean these too.

01:21:56.037 --> 01:21:57.831
Did you love her?

01:22:01.543 --> 01:22:03.336
No.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.978
How could you be
so goddamn stupid? Eh?

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:23.857
Steal works of art?

01:22:25.191 --> 01:22:27.360
To buy things I don't need?

01:22:31.072 --> 01:22:33.408
Who do you think I am?

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:50.425
You had asked me

01:22:52.344 --> 01:22:54.179
what I'm scared of.

01:22:59.559 --> 01:23:02.604
And I've been scared
since I first met you.

01:23:02.771 --> 01:23:06.191
I've been scared
that you would leave me.

01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:11.321
Scared that we would have a child

01:23:11.488 --> 01:23:13.531
which you would love more than me.

01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:22.123
And I've been scared that you would
see me as I really am

01:23:24.459 --> 01:23:26.044
and hate it.

01:24:34.154 --> 01:24:37.699
<i>I need to see you.
Diana</i>

01:24:38.742 --> 01:24:40.869
I'm sorry about this, Greve.

01:24:41.035 --> 01:24:42.328
It's quite all right.

01:24:42.495 --> 01:24:46.040
Roger Brown is on an unexpected
journey abroad, you see.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:48.960
That sounds exciting.

01:24:49.127 --> 01:24:50.754
Yes, he had to save
an important contract.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.756
But you are in safe hands now.

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:57.927
There are only formalities left,
so it won't take very long.

01:25:01.556 --> 01:25:04.184
Hi, we are supposed
to change a fan in B4.

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:07.395
- Yes.
- We've been in and out the whole day,

01:25:07.562 --> 01:25:09.314
but this card doesn't work.

01:25:12.192 --> 01:25:13.735
Yes, but just wait
until the other guy comes back.

01:25:13.902 --> 01:25:15.320
Who then?

01:25:15.487 --> 01:25:17.363
<i>PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT</i>

01:25:39.761 --> 01:25:42.806
<i>AUTOPSY</i>

01:26:29.644 --> 01:26:30.937
Thank you.

01:27:16.232 --> 01:27:17.525
Hello, guys.

01:27:17.692 --> 01:27:21.029
- Hi.
- Sorry, but we're a bit behind here.

01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:26.159
A lady just got in who's been lying dead
on heating cables for two weeks.

01:27:26.326 --> 01:27:28.119
Have you got any thoughts on this?

01:27:28.286 --> 01:27:31.247
Typical car accident injuries
on both of them.

01:27:31.414 --> 01:27:33.041
The cause of death
is internal hemorrhages.

01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:34.751
But where are the peanuts?

01:27:36.502 --> 01:27:39.213
It says here there was
a bag of peanuts. Where is it?

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.633
I certainly didn't eat them, Sperre.

01:27:41.799 --> 01:27:44.427
Has anyone been in here?
Anyone unauthorized?

01:27:44.594 --> 01:27:47.221
To steal a bag of peanuts?

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:28.740
Who's that?

01:29:35.121 --> 01:29:39.000
What the hell is
going on here, Roger?

01:29:39.167 --> 01:29:41.961
Are you removing evidence?

01:29:44.047 --> 01:29:46.215
Do you think you can get away with this?

01:29:50.428 --> 01:29:52.555
What the hell?

01:29:56.225 --> 01:29:58.311
So you realized
that stuff about the hair?

01:29:58.478 --> 01:30:00.813
That it's where the transmitters were?

01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.566
Lotte placed them there.

01:30:05.568 --> 01:30:09.030
- That's why you killed her?
- Does it feel like a loss?

01:30:09.197 --> 01:30:11.282
- I'll give you a choice.
- That Lotte died?

01:30:11.449 --> 01:30:14.327
If you tell me
what the hell is going on,

01:30:14.494 --> 01:30:15.912
I'll shoot you in the head.

01:30:16.079 --> 01:30:17.580
If not, you'll get
a bullet in your stomach.

01:30:17.747 --> 01:30:19.082
Don't you have
any feelings regarding this?

01:30:19.248 --> 01:30:20.666
Why do you want to know?

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:24.378
Because I would like to know
if people like you really exist.

01:30:24.545 --> 01:30:26.714
- People like me?
- Yes.

01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:30.301
People who are not capable of love.

01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:32.011
People without empathy.

01:30:32.178 --> 01:30:34.222
- Empathy?
- Yes.

01:30:36.641 --> 01:30:38.851
If you want the answer,
just look at yourself in the mirror.

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:40.061
- No.
- Yes.

01:30:40.228 --> 01:30:42.063
- I'm not like you.
- You're not?

01:30:42.230 --> 01:30:44.065
No.

01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:46.901
I have loved someone.

01:30:47.068 --> 01:30:49.904
You have loved someone? Diana?

01:30:50.071 --> 01:30:52.532
You have loved her?

01:30:55.284 --> 01:30:57.870
I'm afraid I have bad news for you.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.172
She tells me she longs for me.

01:31:08.339 --> 01:31:10.675
She wants me.

01:31:13.177 --> 01:31:15.596
And I'm only human.

01:31:15.763 --> 01:31:18.307
Have you ever loved anyone?

01:31:18.474 --> 01:31:20.434
Except for your dead dog?

01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:25.231
I have no time for this, Roger.

01:31:25.398 --> 01:31:27.358
I've got an appointment
with Diana tonight.

01:31:27.525 --> 01:31:31.737
You fetched the hair.
You knew I'd be coming for you. Why?

01:31:31.904 --> 01:31:33.614
A shot in the stomach
means a slow death.

01:31:33.781 --> 01:31:37.368
You'll beg me to kill you.
So I ask you for the last time:

01:31:37.535 --> 01:31:41.455
Why am I here?
What are you smiling at?

01:31:41.622 --> 01:31:44.292
Why am I here?
Hold it right there!

01:31:54.677 --> 01:31:58.306
<i>What happened now?
He was shot! What happened?</i>

01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:04.812
Do you know why I was smiling, Clas?

01:32:06.731 --> 01:32:10.026
Because you just proved
that Diana loves me.

01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:14.280
She didn't come to you
because she wanted you.

01:32:15.323 --> 01:32:17.658
She came to you
to put cartridges in your pistol.

01:32:19.869 --> 01:32:21.787
She replaced
the cartridge in your pistol

01:32:21.954 --> 01:32:24.332
with an empty cartridge.

01:32:25.374 --> 01:32:28.794
Or what do you call them
in Danish? Blanks?

01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:30.546
What are you talking about?

01:32:30.713 --> 01:32:32.298
She hates you.

01:32:34.133 --> 01:32:35.551
She wants you to die.

01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:44.185
But I will give you one chance.

01:32:48.564 --> 01:32:51.609
I have no idea how many bullets
Diana managed to switch.

01:32:57.073 --> 01:32:58.741
This is not like you, Clas.

01:34:06.851 --> 01:34:08.769
Is it over?

01:34:12.982 --> 01:34:14.734
Yes.

01:34:28.956 --> 01:34:32.126
<i>I may not know myself,
but I know others.</i>

01:34:32.293 --> 01:34:33.461
<i>And that's what I gambled on.</i>

01:34:33.627 --> 01:34:37.757
Welcome to this press conference,

01:34:37.923 --> 01:34:40.634
arranged by Oslo Police District
and Kripos.

01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:43.262
<i>I had prepared well.</i>

01:34:44.305 --> 01:34:46.724
<i>The pistol I took from the crash site</i>

01:34:46.891 --> 01:34:49.060
<i>would be found by the police
on Kjikerud's bed table...</i>

01:34:50.102 --> 01:34:52.104
<i>the same pistol
that killed Lotte Madsen,</i>

01:34:52.271 --> 01:34:54.607
<i>whom the press presented
as Greve's lover.</i>

01:34:56.192 --> 01:34:59.070
<i>How the "art burglars"
Ove Kjikerud and Clas Greve</i>

01:34:59.236 --> 01:35:00.863
<i>killed each other
in a bloody shootout...</i>

01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:02.490
The alarm has gone off
over at Ove's place.

01:35:04.158 --> 01:35:06.786
...<i>was watched
by the whole world on the Internet.</i>

01:35:11.916 --> 01:35:14.377
<i>The police would also find
that the pistol Greve fired</i>

01:35:14.543 --> 01:35:19.298
<i>matched the one which fired
the bullet that penetrated Ove's head.</i>

01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:21.300
<i>He should never
have picked up that pistol.</i>

01:35:21.467 --> 01:35:24.845
We are pleased to present
a breakthrough in the case.

01:35:25.012 --> 01:35:27.139
<i>But even though
I had done everything right,</i>

01:35:27.306 --> 01:35:29.141
<i>there was one thing
I could not change.</i>

01:35:30.684 --> 01:35:33.771
<i>Ove was already dead
when I shot Greve.</i>

01:35:35.564 --> 01:35:38.359
<i>But Brede Sperre is
Norway's most renowned investigator.</i>

01:35:38.526 --> 01:35:41.529
<i>Leaving cases unsolved is not his style.</i>

01:35:42.655 --> 01:35:43.864
<i>Especially not after VG called him:</i>

01:35:44.031 --> 01:35:46.117
<i>"The man who makes
Norway sleep well at night."</i>

01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:48.953
<i>Because he is competent?</i>

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.830
<i>Obviously.</i>

01:35:50.996 --> 01:35:55.042
<i>But mainly because he has realized what
it takes to get ahead in this world.</i>

01:35:55.209 --> 01:35:56.669
<i>And what would that be?</i>

01:35:56.836 --> 01:35:59.672
Like I mentioned, this has been
a long, complicated investigation.

01:35:59.839 --> 01:36:01.257
<i>The answer starts with an "R."</i>

01:36:01.424 --> 01:36:03.175
<i>Reputation.</i>

01:36:05.845 --> 01:36:07.555
<i>Something that gets you TV exposure,</i>

01:36:07.721 --> 01:36:10.266
<i>and provides you with texts
from unknown women.</i>

01:36:10.433 --> 01:36:13.519
We believe they celebrated the theft

01:36:13.686 --> 01:36:15.438
and that they lost control completely.

01:36:15.604 --> 01:36:18.649
Because they end up torturing a dog

01:36:18.816 --> 01:36:23.446
and killing the farmer
who owns the cabin?

01:36:23.612 --> 01:36:24.697
That's correct.

01:36:24.864 --> 01:36:26.740
REALTOR OPEN HOUSE

01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:33.539
Have a nice day. Both of you.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.920
We are ready here, Roger.

01:36:40.087 --> 01:36:41.255
Send in the candidate in one minute.

01:36:41.422 --> 01:36:42.756
- Yes.
- Ferdinand.

01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:44.216
Thank you.

01:36:45.926 --> 01:36:49.388
Hi. I'm sorry.

01:36:49.555 --> 01:36:51.557
Please sit down.

01:36:51.724 --> 01:36:55.853
I asked you to come here because
I think we are at the end of a long,

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:00.483
and as you know, dramatic hunt
for Pathfinder's new leader.

01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:02.318
In the last round,
it was completely unrealistic

01:37:02.485 --> 01:37:03.903
to have him released
from his present position.

01:37:04.069 --> 01:37:07.948
Without promising too much,
I believe I have persuaded him.

01:37:08.115 --> 01:37:09.909
Please welcome

01:37:10.075 --> 01:37:11.452
Jeremias Lander.

01:37:13.162 --> 01:37:14.622
Nice to see you again.

01:37:16.999 --> 01:37:18.667
<i>My name is Roger Brown.</i>

01:37:18.834 --> 01:37:20.669
<i>I'm 5'6" tall.</i>

01:37:20.836 --> 01:37:22.755
<i>And you know what?</i>

01:37:22.922 --> 01:37:24.423
<i>That's more than enough.</i>

01:37:26.258 --> 01:37:34.266
