00:01.390 --> 00:03.643
Stella: Previously
on "Life Sentence"...

00:03.690 --> 00:05.033
It's raining...
in our bar!

00:05.090 --> 00:07.172
Half the building
needs new piping.

00:07.220 --> 00:08.824
We gonna need some fast cash
for repairs?

00:08.870 --> 00:10.178
Possibly.

00:10.220 --> 00:11.563
Peter: Can I ask
what's going on

00:11.620 --> 00:13.042
between you
and that doctor?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.090
Stella:
He kissed me last night.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.175
I stopped it.

00:15.230 --> 00:16.482
You'd better
figure this out

00:16.530 --> 00:18.134
before he causes
permanent damage.

00:18.190 --> 00:20.488
There are too many people
in your relationship, Wes.

00:20.540 --> 00:22.019
When you married my daughter,

00:22.060 --> 00:23.539
we had an agreement
you'd take care of her.

00:23.580 --> 00:25.014
And I have.
Really?

00:25.060 --> 00:26.050
By messing around
with your former girlfriend?

00:26.110 --> 00:27.453
You're right.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.013
There are too many people
in this relationship.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.322
Stella: What happened?

00:30.370 --> 00:31.804
Wes: He collapsed
outside our apartment.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.409
Your father's recovering.
The procedure went well.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.155
I still want to make
this work.Stella: So do 1.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.897
But we keep
running into walls.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.816
And I don't know
which way to turn.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.726
Your dad's surgeon
reported me to management,

00:41.780 --> 00:43.771
and the hospital put me
on a temporary suspension.

00:43.820 --> 00:45.948
Me taking a break from here,
it's not a bad thing.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.449
Once upon a time,

00:59.490 --> 01:01.219
all I wanted
was to find someone

01:01.270 --> 01:04.614
who would tell me
he loved me.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.977
But things were simpler
back then.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.976
For one, I was dying...

01:14.030 --> 01:15.156
Peter: It's not over.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.975
There are more aggressive
options.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.896
We've beat this before -- No.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.544
What do you mean "No"?

01:20.600 --> 01:22.113
I don't want to do this
anymore.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.851
It's not working.

01:26.910 --> 01:29.208
And it's really painful
and exhausting.

01:29.260 --> 01:30.989
And doing the same thing
over and over

01:31.040 --> 01:32.121
and expecting
different results,

01:32.170 --> 01:33.649
it's crazy.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.475
Stella, you have
to keep fighting.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.044
If you don't
want the chemo, honey,

01:38.090 --> 01:40.434
we'll find something else.

01:40.490 --> 01:42.219
You can't give up, sis.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.056
I'm not giving up.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.274
I'm giving in...

01:47.320 --> 01:50.278
to fate, to destiny,

01:50.320 --> 01:53.881
to hope that --
that maybe this is

01:53.930 --> 01:56.365
all part of
some greater plan.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.509
I want to do big things

01:59.550 --> 02:03.111
with whatever time
I have left.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.889
I want to climb a mountain.

02:04.950 --> 02:08.853
And I want to stand
under the Eiffel Tower.

02:08.910 --> 02:11.550
And I --
I want to fall in love.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.515
Okay, then.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.345
Let's get you out of here.

02:20.790 --> 02:22.827
But nothing's
that simple anymore.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.097
Will, wait!

02:24.140 --> 02:25.483
Will!

02:27.400 --> 02:29.573
Why are you trying
to ruin my marriage?

02:29.620 --> 02:31.349
Stella,
if your marriage is solid,

02:31.410 --> 02:33.970
then I can't ruin it by --
by telling you how I feel.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.455
I'm sorry, but th-that
is not my fault.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.140
I did not ask you
to fall in love with me.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.020
No, you just made it
impossible not to.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.367
How did I do that?!

02:42.420 --> 02:43.933
By being you, Stella.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.672
Can you please
just be honest with me

02:46.730 --> 02:48.118
about how you feel?

02:49.510 --> 02:50.500
I love Wes.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.119
No.
How you feel about me.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.730
I can't answer that.

02:57.780 --> 02:59.737
Well, then I can't walk away
from this.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.340
Well, maybe youcan't,
but I can.

03:07.140 --> 03:08.528
I said it.

03:08.570 --> 03:10.709
Now all I had to do
is believe it.

03:12.060 --> 03:14.097
Don't worry about a thing

03:14.150 --> 03:17.927
You'll learn to live again

03:17.980 --> 03:19.789
You're gonna learn
to live again

03:19.850 --> 03:23.935
Oh, oh, oh

03:47.220 --> 03:49.268
Stella: Hi.
My name is Stella Jane Abbott.

03:49.310 --> 03:52.484
And if you're watching this,
I'm already dead.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.259
But don't be sad for me.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.004
I had an amazing life.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.312
And before I died,

03:57.360 --> 03:59.920
I got to marry
the man of my dreams.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.620
In fact, my only regret is

04:01.670 --> 04:04.196
that I have to leave him
behind.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.457
Which is why...

04:05.500 --> 04:08.413
I want you
to marry my husband.

04:10.460 --> 04:11.985
This is him --

04:12.030 --> 04:13.282
Wesley Charles.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.466
But it's "Wes" for short.

04:14.510 --> 04:15.284
Although he is not short.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.238
He is 6 feet tall

04:16.290 --> 04:18.110
and has a smile so warm

04:18.170 --> 04:20.161
that it wraps itself
around you.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.512
Here are some things

04:22.560 --> 04:24.073
that I love the most
about him.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.427
He is British,

04:25.480 --> 04:28.086
so his accent adds
this sexy sophistication

04:28.130 --> 04:29.382
to everything he says.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.305
He could be reading
a grocery list,

04:30.350 --> 04:31.784
and you're just like,

04:31.830 --> 04:34.219
"Shut up, why are you so hot
and brilliant?"

04:34.270 --> 04:36.307
He's a crazy romantic.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.010
And when he looks at you,

04:38.060 --> 04:40.404
the whole world
just falls away.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.313
Basically,
he is the greatest man

04:44.370 --> 04:45.883
I have ever known.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.759
So, if you think
you are deserving

04:49.810 --> 04:51.892
of marrying a man
like my husband,

04:51.940 --> 04:53.374
then you need to speak up

04:53.420 --> 04:58.768
and let him know
that it's okay to love again.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.721
And, Wes,
if you're watching this,

05:01.770 --> 05:05.126
my hope for you is
a long, amazing life,

05:05.170 --> 05:07.423
so full of happiness

05:07.480 --> 05:09.209
that you forget
all about me...

05:10.480 --> 05:13.916
...until one day
when we meet again.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.429
For now and always...

05:16.490 --> 05:18.652
I love you.

05:22.710 --> 05:24.405
Stella:
I forgot I made that.

05:24.450 --> 05:28.364
I set it to post
after I was sure that I'd...

05:28.410 --> 05:31.630
That is the nicest thing

05:31.670 --> 05:34.105
anyone's ever done
for me.

05:37.550 --> 05:39.894
I love you.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.079
I love you, too.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.607
Why are you crying?

05:53.650 --> 05:55.789
I came so close
to losing my dad,

05:55.830 --> 05:58.390
and it just...

05:58.440 --> 06:01.660
reminded me of how
not ready I am to lose him.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.394
Or you.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.359
He is not going anywhere,
okay?

06:14.060 --> 06:15.494
And neither am I.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.640
I can't believe we
almost lost him.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.902
I can't believe

06:34.950 --> 06:36.429
that we found a worse way
to spend the night

06:36.480 --> 06:38.437
than sitting through
a kindergarten play.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.211
Tell me how to be
in this world

06:41.270 --> 06:44.570
Tell me how to breathe in
and feel no hurt

06:44.620 --> 06:47.009
Tell me how,
'cause I believe in something

06:48.100 --> 06:51.445
I believe in us

06:51.490 --> 06:53.447
Tell me when the light
goes out As the next few days passed,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.104
we all took shifts
taking care of my dad.

06:55.150 --> 06:56.663
That even in the dark
we will find a way out

06:56.720 --> 06:58.370
But he wasn't the only one
in that room

06:58.410 --> 07:00.014
who was trying to recover.

07:00.070 --> 07:02.289
Tell me how,
'cause I believe in something

07:02.330 --> 07:05.675
I believe in us

07:08.470 --> 07:12.373
We used to be kids
living just for kicks

07:13.650 --> 07:17.120
In cinema seats
learning how to kiss

07:18.610 --> 07:22.046
Running through streets
that were painted gold

07:22.090 --> 07:25.651
We never believed
we'd grow up like this

07:25.700 --> 07:28.431
So tell me how to be
in this world

07:28.490 --> 07:30.481
Tell me how to breathe in
and feel no hurt

07:30.530 --> 07:31.747
Dr. Ackerman:
I have some good news.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.189
Tell me how Mr. Abbott...

07:33.230 --> 07:34.743
"Cause I believe
in something

07:34.800 --> 07:36.052
...your vitals are strong
and consistent enough

07:36.100 --> 07:37.579
that I can send you
home tomorrow.

07:37.630 --> 07:38.665
I believe in us Wes: How about that?

07:38.710 --> 07:40.053
-Oh, my God!

07:40.110 --> 07:42.067
Tell me when the light
goes down

07:42.110 --> 07:45.410
That even in the dark
we will find a way out

07:45.460 --> 07:48.373
Tell me now,
'cause I believe in something

07:48.420 --> 07:49.581
I believe in

07:49.640 --> 07:51.722
I believe in us

07:51.770 --> 07:53.022
I believe in

07:53.080 --> 07:55.026
I believe in something

07:55.080 --> 07:56.115
I believe

07:56.170 --> 07:59.947
I believe in us

08:01.740 --> 08:02.957
Aiden: I took them
all out of hiding,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.479
so you wouldn't be
startled

08:04.520 --> 08:05.828
and have another
heart attack.

08:06.740 --> 08:08.083
All right, well,
let's get this party started.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.177
Come on.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.270
Peter:
Who wants gnome cake?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.059
Thanks for today.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.660
I really appreciate
you being there for me.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.018
We're always
here for you.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.141
No matter what.

08:22.370 --> 08:23.587
I'm glad you feel that way,

08:23.630 --> 08:24.791
because I have something
to tell you...

08:25.760 --> 08:27.671
I'm gonna pop
the question!

08:28.680 --> 08:32.116
Dad,
you and Gina just met.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.889
And you're crushing it
with the ladies.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.898
Not the time to commit,
playa!

08:36.950 --> 08:39.032
Playa's already committed.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.390
But not to Gina.

08:41.429 --> 08:42.773
I'm talking about
your mother.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.779
I'm gonna win her back.

08:50.260 --> 08:53.264
Do you think Mom
wants to come back?I don't know.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.085
But I just realized
that when she left me...

08:55.140 --> 08:57.040
I fought withher,

08:57.100 --> 08:58.522
but I never really
fought forher.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.662
Let's not forget,
Mom's a bi...

09:00.710 --> 09:02.314
That means
I've got a 50/50 shot.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.703
I'll take those odds.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.979
Mm, don't really think
it works that way.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.580
Dad, what about Gina?

09:08.630 --> 09:10.280
I have to break up
with her.

09:10.330 --> 09:11.934
I have to listen
to my heart.

09:11.980 --> 09:13.846
That's what this second chance
is for me.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.413
It's a chance for me
to listen,

09:15.460 --> 09:19.590
to show your mom
that I can do that now.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.028
But I'm gonna need
your help.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.425
Tomorrow night...
at our anniversary party.

09:24.470 --> 09:27.690
You're not having
an anniversary party.Yes, we are.

09:27.740 --> 09:29.083
And you're throwing it.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.291
Ah.

09:30.350 --> 09:33.604
So...we'll do it at the bar,
Aiden?

09:33.660 --> 09:34.991
Yep.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.825
Lizzie, you can help me
with my speech...

09:36.880 --> 09:38.359
Peter:
...and, Stella...

09:38.400 --> 09:40.300
you can make it romantic --

09:40.360 --> 09:42.749
candles, flowers,
the whole shebang.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.407
Dad,

09:45.450 --> 09:47.578
I've never been
more sure of anything.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.144
Part of me
thought he was crazy.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.749
[ Woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A. ]

09:51.800 --> 09:54.144
But I guess I used to be
that crazy, too.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.713
Wes: You sure about this?

09:55.760 --> 09:56.932
I have never been
more sure

09:56.980 --> 09:58.288
about anything
in my life.

09:58.330 --> 09:59.980
My family is gonna
fall in love with you.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.805
I just feel like
we should have given them

10:01.860 --> 10:03.464
a heads up
that we were engaged...

10:03.510 --> 10:04.409
or that I exist.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.598
Diego: There she is!

10:06.640 --> 10:08.426
Oh, she looks
SO grown up.

10:08.470 --> 10:09.642
Stella!Hi!

10:09.690 --> 10:12.296
Welcome home!

10:12.350 --> 10:14.250
Oh.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.995
Who is this?

10:16.050 --> 10:19.042
Thisis Wes.

10:19.090 --> 10:20.910
Hi. Very nice to meet
all of you.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.871
Oh, he's British, isn't he?

10:22.920 --> 10:25.617
Yes, Mom.
And he's also amazing.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.924
And he's my fianc.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.273
We got engaged!

10:32.320 --> 10:34.186
It was so romantic... Oh!

10:34.240 --> 10:35.537
He --Oh, my --

10:35.590 --> 10:36.807
Daddy.

10:36.850 --> 10:38.102
Stella: You okay?

10:38.150 --> 10:40.585
It's just...
all happening so fast.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.634
Well, it's not like
I can really take my time.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.243
Congratulations.

10:53.910 --> 10:56.823
Seeing my father make the most
of his second chance

10:56.870 --> 10:59.692
made me wonder if I was making
the most of mine.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.304
Okay, so that was Gina
on the phone.

11:03.350 --> 11:04.875
She wants to meet
with me.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.228
Your father
broke her heart,

11:06.270 --> 11:07.749
and now she wants
to ruin my career.

11:07.790 --> 11:09.701
This -- This could not
get any worse.

11:09.750 --> 11:10.922
Oh, no, wait.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.222
I also have to lie
to your mother

11:12.280 --> 11:13.759
about your father's
big surprise.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.097
I'm a very bad liar,
babe.

11:15.150 --> 11:16.538
Gina is not going to
ruin your career

11:16.580 --> 11:17.923
because my father
broke up with her.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.714
Your father broke up
with Gina?

11:20.760 --> 11:22.580
I should go away.

11:24.550 --> 11:25.847
Oh, Lizzie, I feel awful.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.720
I'm gonna call Gina.No, no, no.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.374
I think you might
want to give her a minute.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.240
Or longer.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.633
Hey, listen,

11:32.690 --> 11:34.294
Stella, Aiden and I
were thinking that

11:34.340 --> 11:35.944
we should do family dinner
at the bar tomorrow night.

11:35.990 --> 11:38.300
You know, with everything
that's happened,

11:38.340 --> 11:40.513
it might be nice for all of us
to be together.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.904
I think that
is so sweet, dear.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.086
I'd love to.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.529
I have to admit,

11:45.570 --> 11:47.390
I'm sorry to hear
that Gina won't be there.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.784
She really
made your father happy.

11:49.830 --> 11:51.616
And she made my eyes happy.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.617
Mama couldn't touch,
but she could look.

11:55.930 --> 11:57.318
Stella: Oh, hey.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.180
Thanks for grabbing those
for the party.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.628
I would've been here sooner,

12:00.670 --> 12:02.923
but I just got accosted
at Ophelia's Flowers.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.540
A woman wanted to help me
take these to your grave.

12:05.590 --> 12:08.503
I'm guessing
she saw the video.

12:08.550 --> 12:09.585
Wow.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.290
Well,
we'll just take it down.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.503
I don't know how much good
that's gonna do.

12:13.550 --> 12:15.769
It's already been reposted
a bunch of times.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.686
Then we'll make
another one.

12:21.210 --> 12:22.427
I think you're going
a little bit overboard

12:22.480 --> 12:23.902
with the lighting.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.737
I just want everyone to see
how healthy I am

12:27.790 --> 12:28.780
and how happy we are.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.218
Okay.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.302
You ready?

12:35.360 --> 12:36.395
Yeah.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.829
Okay. We are live.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.791
Hi, my name is
Stella Jane Abbott,

12:45.850 --> 12:48.194
and I do not want you
to marry my husband.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.413
Turns out
I'm not drying after all.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.714
And we are going to live
happily ever after.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.118
Hmm.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.468
<i>Didn't realize
you could comment in real time.</i>

12:57.510 --> 12:58.636
This is fun.

12:59.990 --> 13:01.116
Wait, what?

13:01.170 --> 13:02.729
W-Why would he be
freaking out?

13:02.780 --> 13:04.168
Oh, no,
I'm not freaking out.

13:04.210 --> 13:06.816
I am really very excited
about our future together.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.952
What does our future
look like?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.913
Well...

13:13.960 --> 13:17.487
Uh, we are setting down roots
here in Asheville.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.578
We will buy a house
someday.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.487
Uh, we'll start a family...

13:22.540 --> 13:24.349
Listening to Wes
tell the world

13:24.410 --> 13:26.538
exactly what he wanted
our future to be

13:26.580 --> 13:29.663
made me realize
I had no idea what I wanted.

13:31.370 --> 13:33.156
Is that what I want?

13:33.200 --> 13:36.249
I guess living in the --
in the house I grew up in,

13:36.290 --> 13:37.849
in the town I grew up in,

13:37.900 --> 13:42.201
a-and running the hospital
that I basically grew up in...

13:42.250 --> 13:43.638
seems kinda small

13:43.690 --> 13:45.727
considering there's
a whole world out there.

13:45.780 --> 13:48.078
But it could be great,
who knows?

13:48.130 --> 13:50.428
The point is,
we are great today

13:50.480 --> 13:51.641
<i>and we are
figuring out tomorrow</i>

13:51.700 --> 13:52.644
'cause I'm not dead.

13:52.700 --> 13:53.690
So...bye.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.473
Thanks a lot.What did I do?

13:57.530 --> 13:59.259
You just told the whole world
what our future looks like

13:59.310 --> 14:00.835
and put me on the spot
to agree with you,

14:00.880 --> 14:02.302
which makes it seem like
we're not on solid ground,

14:02.360 --> 14:03.441
which was
the whole point.

14:03.490 --> 14:04.616
All I did was pitch

14:04.660 --> 14:06.139
a pretty harmless future
for us,

14:06.190 --> 14:08.010
and you
totally freaked out.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.017
I did not freak out.
I didn't.

14:10.060 --> 14:11.448
And I hate when you accuse
me of freaking out when I'm not,

14:11.500 --> 14:12.843
because that makes me
freak out,

14:12.890 --> 14:14.278
so it turns into some
self-fulfilling prophecy

14:14.330 --> 14:15.889
where I act like
a lunatic. Stella.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.066
What?We're still live.

14:17.110 --> 14:18.498
Oh, crap.

14:26.210 --> 14:27.598
Stell,
what are you doing?

14:27.640 --> 14:28.812
Responding to all

14:28.860 --> 14:30.771
these ridiculous comments
on our video

14:30.820 --> 14:32.470
about how we clearly
weren't planning on

14:32.520 --> 14:33.908
having an actual future
together.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.600
Well...we weren't,
were we?

14:38.660 --> 14:39.957
No.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.217
But now we are...

14:41.270 --> 14:44.092
so we will figure it out,
Hater282.

14:48.490 --> 14:49.924
We'll figure it out,
right?

14:49.970 --> 14:52.314
Of course we will.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.180
So let's talk about it.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.231
Our future --
Let's figure it out.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.236
Right now?

14:57.280 --> 14:58.839
Seems like a lot to go into

14:58.890 --> 14:59.937
before we've even
had coffee.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.100
I just feel all this
crazy pressure.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.503
I'm not pressuring you.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.461
Well, that doesn't stop me
from feeling it.

15:06.510 --> 15:08.285
And it doesn't stop them
from mocking us.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.555
It's about the bar.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.726
I forgot I have a meeting

15:13.780 --> 15:15.123
with a potential buyer
today.

15:15.170 --> 15:16.205
Yeah, go ahead.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.035
I'll just be here.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.786
Defending our marriage.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.910
Wes, hey!

15:28.970 --> 15:30.870
Your friend here
was just telling me

15:30.930 --> 15:32.967
his company may be
interested in your offer

15:33.010 --> 15:34.353
to sell the bar.

15:34.410 --> 15:36.014
Richard: Now, I'm gonna
go through the numbers

15:36.060 --> 15:37.403
and be in touch.

15:37.450 --> 15:39.361
Oh, great.
Thank you so much, Richard.

15:39.410 --> 15:41.196
Yeah,
thanks a million, Dick!

15:43.550 --> 15:44.711
You were gonna sell my bar

15:44.760 --> 15:45.898
without talking to me
first?

15:45.940 --> 15:47.066
Okay. Ourbar.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.679
And I'm sorry
I didn't tell you,

15:48.730 --> 15:50.721
but Richard's company
could take over our lease,

15:50.770 --> 15:51.987
and pay back the debt --

15:52.030 --> 15:53.247
So we walk away
with nothing

15:53.300 --> 15:54.506
but your stupid
sex painting?

15:54.560 --> 15:55.982
Yes.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.690
I know that is
a sex painting.

15:57.730 --> 16:00.074
And while I am grossed out,
because it's my sister,

16:00.130 --> 16:01.609
I have to admit
it's kind of cool,

16:01.650 --> 16:03.345
and I can't believe
I've never made one.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.610
Aiden, look, we can't reopen
without running water.

16:06.660 --> 16:08.526
So, what would you say
if, uh --

16:08.570 --> 16:10.481
if I found the money?

16:10.530 --> 16:12.578
I would say
that you have robbed a bank,

16:12.620 --> 16:14.440
or you've made a deal
with a dark wizard,

16:14.490 --> 16:16.447
because there is literally
nothing I haven't tried.

16:16.490 --> 16:17.571
Are you sure
you're not just

16:17.620 --> 16:19.145
giving up
on this partnership,

16:19.190 --> 16:21.534
because you're worried about
your other partnership?

16:21.580 --> 16:23.969
And I'm not giving up
this place.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.320
So...I'm gonna find
another way.

16:27.370 --> 16:29.839
Be my guest.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.020
Hey, sis.

16:33.070 --> 16:34.549
I will need
one free coffee

16:34.600 --> 16:36.079
and a free muffin stat.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.680
You do realize
I'm standing right here.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.289
I do,
but I am broke and hungry.

16:40.340 --> 16:41.466
- Plus I have
an important meeting

16:41.520 --> 16:42.464
with a potential
investor.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.124
That's great.Seriously?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.036
Who would be rich enough
and dumb enough

16:46.090 --> 16:47.125
to invest in you?

16:49.610 --> 16:51.829
Oh, my God, Stella!

16:51.880 --> 16:53.689
Marlene.
Hey!

16:55.270 --> 16:56.396
You better ask her
for money fast,

16:56.450 --> 16:57.781
before she ruins
my floors.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.831
My water just broke.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.223
Too late.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.089
Uh...do you need a ride
to the hospital?

17:03.150 --> 17:04.276
Um...

17:04.319 --> 17:05.105
You don't have a car.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.584
Or a license.

17:06.630 --> 17:07.665
Huh?

17:10.940 --> 17:13.238
Aiden: All right, baby on board.
Let's do this.

17:13.290 --> 17:15.804
Stella: Good luck.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.510
Dr. Grant: Stella.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.461
Hey, can we talk?

17:19.510 --> 17:20.853
There's nothing left
to talk about.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.777
I think I made that
perfectly clear.

17:22.819 --> 17:24.810
I don't think that we should
even see each other anymore.

17:24.859 --> 17:25.998
Okay, well,
that shouldn't be a problem.

17:27.390 --> 17:28.733
I'm leaving Asheville
tonight.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.306
Do you...
just have five minutes

17:31.350 --> 17:32.738
SO we can say goodbye?

17:34.830 --> 17:36.264
So, where are you going?

17:36.310 --> 17:38.130
Papua New Guinea.

17:38.180 --> 17:40.786
People don't go
to Papua New Guinea.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.137
Well, they do

17:42.190 --> 17:43.999
if Doctors Without Borders
stations them there.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.757
Truth is, this is something

17:46.800 --> 17:47.961
I've always wanted to do,
you know,

17:48.020 --> 17:49.363
help people
that really needed me,

17:49.410 --> 17:50.627
to go see the world.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.671
Well,
that sounds amazing.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.801
Come with me.

18:03.770 --> 18:05.204
I can't come with you.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.809
My whole life is here.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.168
No, Stella,
your past is here.

18:08.210 --> 18:10.998
But your future
could be bigger than this.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.292
Great.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.307
So, you saw me freak out
on social media

18:14.350 --> 18:15.863
about my life
being too small and --

18:15.920 --> 18:17.604
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:17.660 --> 18:21.096
You can't expect me
to pack up my life and --

18:21.140 --> 18:23.393
and leave with you
tonight.

18:23.450 --> 18:26.613
This is the real world.
It's not a movie.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.139
I'm not asking you
to come tonight.

18:29.190 --> 18:31.238
You can come
whenever you're ready.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.317
You know,
stay as long as you want.

18:33.370 --> 18:35.452
I'm not asking you
to marry me.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.491
I'm just --

18:37.550 --> 18:38.972
I'm asking you to live.

18:42.460 --> 18:45.020
Oh, and, uh,
for the record,

18:45.080 --> 18:47.686
there's nothing wrong
with living in a movie.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.607
What if Will was right?

19:00.660 --> 19:02.139
What if my future

19:02.180 --> 19:04.524
was supposed to be
bigger than this?

19:04.570 --> 19:05.617
What if...

19:05.660 --> 19:06.741
Sadie: Stella.

19:06.790 --> 19:08.042
Stella: Sadie.
Hey.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.352
What are you doing here?

19:09.400 --> 19:10.356
I leave for Seattle today

19:10.410 --> 19:11.923
for the rest of the trial,

19:11.970 --> 19:13.313
so my Aunt Cindy and I
wanted to come see you.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.704
Because you took
such good care of our girl,

19:15.760 --> 19:17.535
I was able to save up
enough vacation time

19:17.590 --> 19:18.534
to go with her,

19:18.590 --> 19:20.240
so thank you.

19:21.810 --> 19:23.062
Well, most of the time,

19:23.110 --> 19:25.249
it felt like
she was taking care of me.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.371
Because I was.

19:26.420 --> 19:27.854
Stella's a hot mess.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.766
We should probably get going.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.163
I'll meet you at the car?

19:31.210 --> 19:32.166
Yeah.Bye-bye.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.076
Bye.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.293
I don't want
to say goodbye,

19:38.350 --> 19:40.000
'cause it feels like
bad luck.

19:40.040 --> 19:44.216
Sadie, you're gonna make it
through this trial.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.999
And you are
going to graduate

19:46.050 --> 19:47.779
from high school
with honors,

19:47.830 --> 19:49.650
and go to college
somewhere warm and sunny,

19:49.710 --> 19:52.179
and you're probably
gonna become a doctor.

19:52.230 --> 19:53.743
Or president.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.484
Or a doctor president.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.793
You have an oddly clear vision
of my future.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.662
Yeah.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.621
Now I just need one
for my own.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.546
Well, thanks for
believing in me.

20:05.590 --> 20:07.240
And for being
my best friend.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.019
Fun fact --

20:09.070 --> 20:11.983
when we first met,
I didn't even like you.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.552
Come here.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.290
Thank you.

20:19.340 --> 20:20.819
There you go.

20:20.870 --> 20:22.258
There?
Wes: Uh-huh.

20:23.220 --> 20:24.563
Again.

20:24.610 --> 20:27.307
Hey!

20:27.350 --> 20:29.170
He isn't supposed
to see the bride

20:29.220 --> 20:30.745
before the wedding.Mm.

20:30.790 --> 20:33.521
We're not really worried
about bad luck.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.615
Let me do that.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.355
The ceremony starts in 20.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.357
All right.
See you out there.

20:38.410 --> 20:40.060
You most certainly will.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.276
Wes --
I know.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.844
You don't like me.

20:47.890 --> 20:49.892
It's not
that I don't like you.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.250
It's just,

20:52.290 --> 20:53.678
I've spent
the past eight years

20:53.730 --> 20:57.075
trying to prepare myself
for the fact

20:57.120 --> 20:58.895
that I might lose
my little girl.

20:58.950 --> 21:04.127
And now I feel like
I'm losing her twice.

21:07.780 --> 21:09.430
I get that.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.347
I will take care of her,
Mr. Abbott.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.619
I will give Stella
a lifetime of love

21:14.660 --> 21:16.480
over these next
eight months.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.490
In that case...

21:22.540 --> 21:24.497
welcome to the family,
son.

21:32.070 --> 21:33.322
Ah.

21:33.370 --> 21:34.713
This place
is looking great!

21:34.770 --> 21:35.931
Ah.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.504
Perfect for sweeping Ida
off her feet.

21:38.550 --> 21:41.156
I really hope
she says yes.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.338

the inspiration.

21:45.730 --> 21:46.811
What's goin' on?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.258
Oh, no, nothing.
Nothing.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.474
I just, um...

21:51.520 --> 21:54.342
It's just what you said
about me and Stella.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.470
I just --

21:55.530 --> 21:57.567
I feel like
I'm failing her.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.964
I don't know.
Hey.

22:00.010 --> 22:01.353
You saved her.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.004
You're the reason

22:03.060 --> 22:04.744

the clinical trial.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.529
If it wasn't for you,

22:06.580 --> 22:08.184
we'd all have lost her.

22:08.230 --> 22:10.665
I still might.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.370
I've tried everything
I can think of

22:12.410 --> 22:13.969
to make her happy.

22:14.020 --> 22:17.103
But I know she's questioning
her future with me.

22:17.160 --> 22:21.245
You know,
when Ida and I got married,

22:21.290 --> 22:23.896
everything we had
was old and borrowed.

22:23.950 --> 22:26.510
The only thing blue was
the discount tux I wore.

22:28.340 --> 22:29.774
For our something new,

22:29.820 --> 22:31.549
Ida asked me to get these
specific champagne flutes

22:31.610 --> 22:32.907
for the toast.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.566
So, I went to get them.

22:35.610 --> 22:38.693
But then I saw these expensive
Waterford crystal ones.

22:38.740 --> 22:40.469
And I decided to show off.

22:42.620 --> 22:46.443
Well, later, I realized
the flutes she asked me for

22:46.490 --> 22:47.969
were the same kind

22:48.010 --> 22:50.058
her grandparents toasted with
at their wedding.

22:52.450 --> 22:55.408
But I couldn't
see that then,

22:55.460 --> 22:57.588
because I was too wrapped up
in my own idea

22:57.630 --> 22:59.416
of what would
make her happy.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.379
So...

23:02.420 --> 23:05.026
This time...

23:06.640 --> 23:09.428
...I'm getting
out of the way.

23:14.390 --> 23:16.427
Wow.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.177
Son, there are times
when the person you love

23:19.220 --> 23:23.305
is telling you
exactly what they need.

23:23.350 --> 23:24.875
You just have to listen.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.260
Aiden:
So, that's my pitch.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.539

of foot traffic,

non-liquid assets

23:35.840 --> 23:37.797

a real chance

23:39.330 --> 23:40.809

special here. Got it.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.454
Fantastic presentation.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.763

Are you in?

Yeah, I can't.

23:47.330 --> 23:48.286
Come on. Why not?

23:49.470 --> 23:51.461
I'm sorry.
This is your moment.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.467
And you are gonna
crush it in there.

23:53.510 --> 23:54.648

or...?

23:54.690 --> 23:57.204

I'm gonna be fine.

23:57.260 --> 23:59.297

29:18.840 --> 29:20.228
They're gonna join us
in @ minute.

29:22.190 --> 29:24.887
I wanted to say something to you
in private first.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.534
I never felt magic
crazy as this

29:26.590 --> 29:28.888
I know I can't
change the past.

29:28.940 --> 29:31.898
But I can change
the future.

29:31.940 --> 29:33.760
Our future.

29:33.810 --> 29:36.120
I never held emotion

29:36.160 --> 29:37.503
In the palm of my hand

29:37.550 --> 29:40.076
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you,

29:40.120 --> 29:41.201
Ida Kaminsky Abbott.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.719
And I promise,

29:43.780 --> 29:45.817
this time things
are gonna be different.

29:47.300 --> 29:48.517
Brighten
my northern sky

29:48.560 --> 29:51.564
Stella Jane Abbott,

29:51.610 --> 29:56.002
I vow to love you
for the rest of your life.

29:56.050 --> 29:58.747
I promise to be
open and honest with you

29:58.790 --> 29:59.780
from this moment on.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.831
To let you grow and explore

30:01.880 --> 30:03.837
without jealousy
or hesitation.

30:03.880 --> 30:07.054
Wesley Edward Charles,

30:07.100 --> 30:10.627
I vow to love you
for the rest of my life.

30:10.670 --> 30:12.889
Even though
you have three first names,

30:12.940 --> 30:15.363
which make you sound like
a serial killer.

30:17.510 --> 30:20.241
I promise to figure out
how to retire in Tuscany...

30:20.290 --> 30:22.759
...like we always
dreamed about.

30:22.820 --> 30:24.026
You can paint.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.559
I can farm.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.852
Or you can farm
and I can paint.

30:26.910 --> 30:27.900
We'll keep it loose.

30:29.170 --> 30:30.683
We can have chickens.

30:32.560 --> 30:36.565
I vow to make every day together
an adventure.

30:36.610 --> 30:40.490
And after I die,
I vow to haunt you.

30:41.790 --> 30:43.963
Because I know you've always
wanted to meet a ghost.

30:45.230 --> 30:46.618
Peter:
And most importantly...

30:46.670 --> 30:50.880
Would you love me
for my head?

30:50.930 --> 30:52.409
...promise...

30:52.450 --> 30:54.930
Would love me
through the winter?

30:54.980 --> 30:56.630
- Peter:
...to listen to you always.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.159
Would you love me
till I'm dead?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.588
Ohh.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.507
"Cause knowing
what's in your heart, Ida,

31:02.550 --> 31:03.893
is the most important thing
to me.

31:03.940 --> 31:06.284
Come blow your horn
on high

31:06.340 --> 31:08.559
So...

31:10.820 --> 31:12.254
...will you do me the honor

31:12.300 --> 31:14.348
of being my wife
all over again?

31:17.480 --> 31:20.438
I never felt magic
crazy as this

31:20.480 --> 31:21.470
No.

31:22.920 --> 31:26.709
I never saw moons
knew the meaning of the sea

31:26.750 --> 31:28.923
Oh, Peter.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.404
Don't you see?

31:30.450 --> 31:32.350
You just told me

31:32.410 --> 31:35.448
how much you want
to move forward with our lives,

31:35.500 --> 31:38.367
but getting married
is a step backwards.

31:38.410 --> 31:40.196
We tried that.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.675
And to try the same thing
over and over

31:42.720 --> 31:44.154
and expect
different results

31:44.200 --> 31:45.986
would be crazy.

31:47.990 --> 31:49.116
I get it.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.377
The answer is no.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.467
Yes. My answer is no.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.330
But...

31:54.390 --> 31:56.040
you asked
the wrong question.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.993
What's the right question?

31:59.040 --> 32:01.566
"Will you go out on a date
with me?"

32:04.310 --> 32:05.527
So, what do you say?

32:07.490 --> 32:09.788
Will you go on a date with me
tomorrow?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.786
Ah, no. I have plans.

32:12.930 --> 32:13.874
I'm kidding.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.830
I'd love to.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.629
As I watched
my mom and dad

32:19.670 --> 32:21.980
take a step
into their future,

32:22.020 --> 32:23.749
I finally felt clear
about mine.

32:23.810 --> 32:25.198
Yes!

32:25.240 --> 32:26.583
Surprise!

32:26.640 --> 32:29.325
Elizabeth: Surprise.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.508
Ida: Oh, my goodness.
You're all here.

32:31.550 --> 32:32.676
Wes...

32:35.300 --> 32:36.688
...] think --

32:36.730 --> 32:38.038
We should break up.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.209
Wes, listen...

32:44.260 --> 32:45.432
Look, Stella,
please don't,

32:45.480 --> 32:46.823
or I might not
have the courage

32:46.870 --> 32:48.395
to see this through.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.953
I wasn't gonna stop you.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.915
I was gonna say
the same thing.

32:57.580 --> 32:59.537
I know.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.014
I feel like
you've been trying

33:01.060 --> 33:02.494
to say that
for a while, but --

33:02.540 --> 33:05.009
Look, I love you too much
to let you go.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.620
And I love you too much
to not let you.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.934
Running through the heat
heart beat

33:12.990 --> 33:14.856
On our wedding day,

33:14.900 --> 33:16.243
I promised your father

33:16.290 --> 33:18.429
that I would
take care of you.

33:18.470 --> 33:21.076
You light up
my cold heart

33:21.120 --> 33:22.463
And I know now

33:22.520 --> 33:24.124
that the only way
I can really do that

33:24.170 --> 33:26.867
is to let you go.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.124
You'll never be able
to figure out

33:31.180 --> 33:33.694
what you want out of life

33:33.750 --> 33:36.435
if you have to worry about
keeping our marriage afloat.

33:38.790 --> 33:41.009
Listen, the truth is,

33:41.060 --> 33:44.667
it just hasn't been as buoyant
as we'd have hoped.

33:44.710 --> 33:48.749
And you'll be dark
in my life

33:48.800 --> 33:50.541
But, you know what?
That's okay.

33:50.590 --> 33:55.847
Because our marriage
was a life boat.

33:55.900 --> 33:59.200
And I think that it's done
exactly what it needed to do.

34:01.860 --> 34:04.113
It saved us both.

34:05.390 --> 34:07.256
A love like this

34:07.300 --> 34:09.348
Won't last forever

34:09.389 --> 34:11.643
It was meant to be, Stell.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.384
It just wasn't meant
to be forever.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.170
I know that a love
like this

34:16.219 --> 34:19.746
Won't last forever

34:19.790 --> 34:21.007
But I

34:21.050 --> 34:22.358
I don't really mind

34:22.400 --> 34:24.266
I want you to know that...

34:24.320 --> 34:25.742
you kept
that other promise

34:25.800 --> 34:27.666
that you made to my father
on our wedding day.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.268
You have given me
a lifetime of love

34:32.330 --> 34:33.581
in these last eight months.

34:36.290 --> 34:37.542
You heard that?

34:38.719 --> 34:41.280
I would have died happy,
Wes.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.114
Well, actually,
if you think about it...

34:45.210 --> 34:47.940
...things are turning out
just the way we planned.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.779
I'm still gonna love you
for the rest of my life.

34:54.830 --> 34:56.867
You're just not gonna be around
to see it.

34:58.310 --> 35:01.484
I am going to love you
for the rest of mine, too.

35:01.530 --> 35:04.227
A love like this No matter what.

35:04.270 --> 35:07.490
Won't last forever

35:09.280 --> 35:13.103
I know that a love like this

35:13.150 --> 35:16.973
Won't last forever

35:17.980 --> 35:19.015
Come on.

35:19.070 --> 35:22.324
A love like this

35:22.380 --> 35:25.680
Stella: We decided to keep
our decision to ourselves.

35:25.730 --> 35:26.811
At least for now.

35:27.990 --> 35:29.116
This was Mom and Dad's night.

35:29.170 --> 35:32.856
A love like this

35:37.260 --> 35:41.697
A love like this

35:41.740 --> 35:46.177
A love like this

35:46.230 --> 35:49.222
A love like this

35:49.270 --> 35:50.999
Hey.
Where are you going?

35:51.060 --> 35:54.837
To start making the most
of my second chance.

35:54.890 --> 35:56.540
I don't know exactly
what that means,

35:56.580 --> 35:58.366
but good luck.

35:58.410 --> 35:59.627
Thanks.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.114
That really
was a good idea.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.810
I know, right?

36:12.120 --> 36:15.511
Hey, is everything okay
with you and Stella?

36:18.430 --> 36:21.388
So...is now a bad time
to tell you

36:21.440 --> 36:23.829
that I found an investor
to save the bar?

36:26.220 --> 36:30.259
[ Woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A. ]

36:37.450 --> 36:38.497
Stella: Will.

36:38.540 --> 36:39.974
Will!

36:42.460 --> 36:43.495
Hi.

36:43.540 --> 36:45.679
You came.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.063
I got to be honest,

36:47.110 --> 36:48.191
I didn't think
that you would,

36:48.240 --> 36:49.378
but I'm so glad
that you did.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.502
No, Will,
I'm not going with you.

36:53.420 --> 36:57.209
I came here because
I owe you an explanation.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.116
You don't owe me
anything.

36:59.170 --> 37:02.424
Stella, all I wanted
was for you to be happy.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.260
I just thought
it might be with me.

37:07.310 --> 37:10.610
I-I've got to figure out
how to make myself happy

37:10.660 --> 37:12.958
before I can be happy
with anyone else.

37:15.050 --> 37:18.350
But I needed to thank you
for reminding me

37:18.410 --> 37:20.799
of how big my future
can be.

37:22.450 --> 37:25.329
And for that,
I will always...

37:26.980 --> 37:29.802
...be grateful.

37:29.850 --> 37:32.638
You know, before I met you,
my heart was in pieces,

37:32.680 --> 37:37.334
and you helped me figure out
how to put it back together.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.815
And for that,

37:39.860 --> 37:41.589
I will always...

37:43.430 --> 37:45.080
...be grateful.

38:05.930 --> 38:07.409
I'll see you around,
Mighty Mouse.

38:11.070 --> 38:13.846
The wolves are out

38:13.900 --> 38:17.370
The teeth are on my tail

38:22.560 --> 38:24.858
Mm

38:24.910 --> 38:27.072
The secret's out

38:27.130 --> 38:28.336
And blood is on the trail

38:28.390 --> 38:30.904
Cheers.
Cheers.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.305
And I don't care

38:34.350 --> 38:36.307
Ahh.

38:38.700 --> 38:41.044
Wes, listen.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.261
I don't want you
to feel like

38:42.320 --> 38:43.651
you have to stick around
Asheville

38:43.710 --> 38:45.667
for the bar.

38:45.710 --> 38:47.701
If I learned anything
from tonight,

38:47.760 --> 38:50.707
it's that if you love someone,
you got to set them free.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.012
You love me?

38:53.060 --> 38:54.619
Of course I do.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.103
You're my brother.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.413
Plus, having you around
makes me miss Obama less.

39:01.860 --> 39:02.930
Seriously though.

39:02.990 --> 39:04.378
I don't want you
to feel like

39:04.420 --> 39:05.763
you owe it to me
to stay here.

39:05.820 --> 39:07.242
Thank you
for saying that, man.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.384
But I am not
going anywhere.

39:13.430 --> 39:15.387
Really?

39:15.440 --> 39:16.475
This is my home.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.340
This is my bar.

39:19.830 --> 39:21.696
Ourbar.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.919
This is not the end

39:24.970 --> 39:26.449
I'm not going anywhere.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.572
Thank God.

39:30.190 --> 39:33.319
All right, so,
tell me about this investor.

39:33.370 --> 39:34.667
Silent partner.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.279
No control over
anything in the bar.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.491
Still ours 100%.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.100
But there's, you know,
one little condition.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.935
To the left.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.584
Left. My left.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.028
The birds are circling Now up.

39:46.070 --> 39:48.414
Up. Let me explain.
Not down.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.460
Man: Yes, ma'am.

39:49.510 --> 39:50.944
Messing with my head

39:50.990 --> 39:52.298
Man: How's this?

39:52.340 --> 39:53.512
I thought you said
"silent partner."

39:53.560 --> 39:55.517
Turns out Finley
turned 21 last week,

39:55.560 --> 39:56.812
which means two things --

39:56.870 --> 39:58.736
one, she can drink,

39:58.780 --> 40:00.999
and two,
she just gained access

40:01.050 --> 40:03.121
to a bunch of money
her grandmother left her.

40:03.180 --> 40:04.739
She's using
her grandmother's legacy

40:04.790 --> 40:06.303
to buy into a bar?

40:06.360 --> 40:07.748
My grandma
was an alcoholic,

40:07.790 --> 40:09.519
so I thought it's what
she would've wanted.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.139
I'm sentimental that way.

40:11.190 --> 40:12.669
Hey! Your body's 2/3 water

40:12.710 --> 40:14.610
SO you can wait to drink
on your own time.

40:14.670 --> 40:15.922
Man: Yes, ma'am.

40:15.970 --> 40:17.313
She's gonna be fun
to have around.

40:17.370 --> 40:20.795
This is not the end

40:20.850 --> 40:23.933
It was strange being on my own
for the first time,

40:23.980 --> 40:27.450
but I knew everything
was going to be okay.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.467
Oh

40:29.510 --> 40:33.469
This is not the end

40:34.690 --> 40:36.112
I needed to focus on me.

40:36.170 --> 40:37.899
I will look them
in the eye

40:37.950 --> 40:39.998
For now, anyway.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.771
Will not be
the beast that hides

40:42.830 --> 40:45.299
Stella: And, Wes,
if you're watching this,

40:45.350 --> 40:49.651
my hope for you is
a long, amazing life

40:49.700 --> 40:51.486
so full of happiness

40:51.530 --> 40:54.875
that you forget
all about me

40:54.930 --> 40:57.399
until one day
when we meet again.

40:58.890 --> 41:02.053
Now and always,
I love you.

41:02.110 --> 41:03.362
It's not the end

41:04.850 --> 41:05.931
This is not the end

41:05.980 --> 41:08.290
It's not the end

41:08.330 --> 41:09.456
Wes: Hey.

41:09.510 --> 41:11.023
I'll fight for it

41:11.070 --> 41:12.287
You ready, missus?

41:12.330 --> 41:14.332
I sure am, mister.

41:18.430 --> 41:21.866
Trouble will come

41:21.910 --> 41:26.165
Trouble will go

41:26.220 --> 41:30.396
It's not the end
