WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:20.937
<i>It's just before lights out,</i>
<i>there's a quietness,</i>

00:21.229 --> 00:22.731
<i>a stagnated mood,</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:27.944
<i>and I'm responsible,</i>
<i>for half the reason, why it's like this.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:32.282
<i>But...</i>

00:32.782 --> 00:34.701
<i>the original root of the problem</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:38.079
<i>should be blamed on  the pilot,</i>
<i>El Hoshino, too.</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:42.417
<i>Yeah, we were baffled,</i>
<i>here at Tsuiki, too.</i>

00:42.792 --> 00:45.587
<i>Since Senior Master Sergeant Hoshino</i>
<i>had been assigned,</i>

00:45.795 --> 00:49.299
<i>the Tsuiki OTF has remained</i>
<i>in Foxtrot mode,</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:51.259
<i>and we don't know the reason why.</i>

00:51.342 --> 00:54.345
And it stayed in Hotel mode
for her predecessor, yes?

00:54.429 --> 00:56.806
<i>Nonetheless, it can still take flight,</i>

00:56.973 --> 00:59.184
<i>but we don't have a substitute pilot,</i>
<i>either.</i>

00:59.642 --> 01:01.478
I understand. Thank you.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.523
So, the cause remains unknown?

01:06.024 --> 01:09.235
If this persists,
it may hinder the next mission.

01:09.527 --> 01:13.907
But Vice-Minister Iiboshi
seems to have a plan in mind.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.743
Try to think of it this way.

01:17.118 --> 01:20.997
An OTF welcomes a pilot,
a foreign substance, into its body,

01:21.122 --> 01:23.875
and entrusts the pilot
to move it at will.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.503
There is no greater disgrace.

01:26.961 --> 01:31.257
Which is why... the OTF demand much
of their pilots.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.260
In exchange for relinquishing control
of their bodies,

01:34.677 --> 01:37.514
they hold onto their mental liberties.

01:38.473 --> 01:42.393
In other words,
the White Lover has a white heart,

01:43.311 --> 01:45.313
a young maiden with a blank slate.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.358
That's where the aptitude test
came in, yes?

01:48.691 --> 01:52.445
They are unsatisfied
because they believe they are incomplete.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.404
Precisely.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.907
By having the OTF by their sides

01:56.032 --> 01:58.660
they have discovered their identities
for the first time.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
If there is a girl like that,

02:01.329 --> 02:04.833
the OTF will allow the unification.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.544
But in El Hoshino's case,

02:07.836 --> 02:11.422
her heart does not seem open to her OTF.

02:11.506 --> 02:15.009
You mustn't forget, Commander Sosoda.

02:16.010 --> 02:19.681
The one who chose her
was none other than the OTF, itself.

02:23.017 --> 02:27.939
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone & Masotan

02:49.169 --> 02:53.548
WHO LIKES TO BE DISLIKED

04:12.335 --> 04:13.503
Yes!

04:14.212 --> 04:16.464
ACM really is the best.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.802
Thanks to the OTF being grounded
for the time being,

04:20.885 --> 04:24.097
we can actually get back
to training for real.

04:25.556 --> 04:26.766
What's wrong with you?

04:26.849 --> 04:30.186
You're not acting like you're
the leading male star.

04:30.395 --> 04:34.941
I feel like I really messed up, this time.

04:35.233 --> 04:39.654
-Oh, are you talking about El Hoshino?
-What're you getting worked up about?

04:39.737 --> 04:44.450
This is when you wear her down
till she compromises, right? Fever time!

04:44.742 --> 04:47.036
She's pretty worn down now.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.496
Now's the time. Now!

04:48.746 --> 04:50.540
-Fever, fever!
-Hey, Castle!

04:50.623 --> 04:52.750
-Fever, fever!
-Eel!

04:52.834 --> 04:55.003
-Y-You think so?
-Oh yeah.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.881
Fever, fever!

05:06.723 --> 05:08.016
We'll end here, for today.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.314
The briefing will commence at 1800.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.108
Until then,
you are all permitted free time.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.151
Yes, ma'am!

05:18.526 --> 05:19.402
Dismissed.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.953
That chick is seriously in bad shape.

05:29.704 --> 05:33.166
Well, that's got nothing to do with me.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.671
Heave... ho!

05:43.134 --> 05:44.677
You know, Futomomo,

05:45.887 --> 05:47.889
I got angry.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.307
What should I do?

05:49.766 --> 05:54.187
When a big girl like me gets mad,
it seems intimidating, doesn't it?

05:55.063 --> 05:57.065
They'll be afraid of me.

06:14.165 --> 06:19.754
Your pilot doesn't come to see you, huh?
Then how about if I ride you, instead?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.801
Just kidding.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.806
What the hell.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.516
What should I do?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.601
Everyone is mocking me.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.687
At this rate, we'll never be able
to meet halfway.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.857
Even hearing that aloud is jarring.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.527
I refuse to let anyone put me in my place.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.239
I wonder why
Hoshino won't acknowledge F-2.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.282
I'm the one not being acknowledged!

06:48.366 --> 06:50.284
Embarrassed during a huge opportunity--

06:50.493 --> 06:53.413
No, rather than embarrassment,
it was Hoshino's self-destruct--

06:53.663 --> 06:56.958
-Eek! When did you--
-I should be asking you that!

06:58.084 --> 06:59.085
U-Um...

06:59.544 --> 07:02.588
I'm sorry!
I was muttering to myself again.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.762
Um... excuse me...

07:09.971 --> 07:10.805
What?

07:11.139 --> 07:12.390
Stop following me.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.183
Even if you say that...

07:15.101 --> 07:17.395
you're in front of my clothes...

07:20.189 --> 07:23.651
Hoshino? Wait!

07:25.069 --> 07:27.196
I did it again.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.781
Why do I always--

07:28.906 --> 07:29.740
Huh?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.245
This is...

07:36.247 --> 07:38.541
What the hell. What the hell!

07:38.666 --> 07:39.750
El!

07:43.087 --> 07:43.921
Hello.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.925
Um, well... what should I say?

07:48.092 --> 07:50.428
Yesterday's training was rough--

07:52.263 --> 07:56.893
Uh... well, I'm just saying,
nobody does well the first time...

07:56.976 --> 07:58.978
So, uh... anyway,

07:59.061 --> 08:01.147
you don't have to be so tight-breasted...

08:01.355 --> 08:04.400
Ah! I just mean,
regardless if you're open or not,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.486
-you know?
-Huh?

08:14.202 --> 08:15.411
Zaito!

08:15.578 --> 08:18.039
Are you back in fever mode? Fever!

08:19.415 --> 08:20.249
Shut up!

08:22.043 --> 08:24.253
Here are the details
about the training session.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.756
At 0500, tomorrow morning,

08:26.964 --> 08:30.635
a live exercise will be held, offshore,
in the Japan Sea with your OTF.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.722
I thought the OTF were grounded.

08:34.805 --> 08:40.019
You will be observed on how you
and your OTF cope in a dire situation.

08:40.478 --> 08:44.565
The training's main purpose is to see how
you make decisions with limited resources,

08:45.024 --> 08:47.485
and your teamwork, as Dragon Pilots.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.070
What the hell is that?

08:49.237 --> 08:52.406
This training exercise
is extremely important.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.910
As a result, you may
be relieved of your Dragon Pilot duties.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.412
-What?
-Relieved of our Dragon Pilot duties?

08:58.788 --> 09:01.207
I will explain the details the day of.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.169
As Dragon Pilots, be self-aware
and take on this challenge earnestly.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.504
That is all.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.464
What should I do?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.675
If I'm relieved of being a Dragon Pilot,

09:11.092 --> 09:13.052
if Masotan is taken away from me,

09:13.135 --> 09:16.973
I'll just be a misfit, with no sense
of personal space muttering to myself.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.892
With teamwork at the heart
of the training,

09:20.268 --> 09:22.311
I'll never make it through this situation.

09:24.855 --> 09:25.815
Masotan?

09:25.898 --> 09:27.817
He's trying to cheer you up.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.154
No!

09:32.363 --> 09:37.493
I don't want to be apart from Masotan!

09:39.870 --> 09:41.747
A-Amakasu!

09:41.914 --> 09:45.459
I haven't given Masotan his bath yet...

09:45.668 --> 09:47.211
Oh, Masotan!

09:47.336 --> 09:50.923
You're all slimy
and taste like chlorine, Masotan!

09:52.300 --> 09:54.510
I'm the same as El Hoshino.

09:55.595 --> 10:01.350
I never once thought of giving the OTF
a name or that it had feelings.

10:01.726 --> 10:05.438
But on that front,
you're very enlightened.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.691
That's why this big guy chose you.

10:08.983 --> 10:13.321
But Masotan has accepted you too, Kaizaki.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.823
-Huh?
-Don't worry.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.744
You will all find a way
to work together, Amakasu.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.746
Like he said.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.456
That's why you--

10:26.500 --> 10:29.503
Nao, let me lick you, too!

10:29.587 --> 10:32.923
Yuck! Dammit! Knock it off!

10:34.425 --> 10:37.928
HISONE & MASOTAN

10:53.861 --> 10:57.156
Your training, this time, will take place
on that deserted island.

10:57.615 --> 11:01.118
The training will be complete
once you've escaped the island

11:01.202 --> 11:02.453
and returned to base.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.496
What?

11:03.579 --> 11:05.414
Escape the island?

11:07.249 --> 11:09.418
There are no boats
that will pass the coast,

11:09.543 --> 11:12.421
and aircraft transit
has already been restricted.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.801
Therefore, there will be no one
to answer your distress calls.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.512
S-So does that mean

11:19.804 --> 11:22.431
this is survival training?

11:22.556 --> 11:24.266
What about using our OTF?

11:24.433 --> 11:27.728
Of course,
returning via OTF is acceptable.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.189
That is, if you can. However...

11:30.439 --> 11:31.273
Huh?

11:31.565 --> 11:33.234
...you only have one week.

11:33.484 --> 11:37.405
If you are unable to escape in that time,
we will be forced to retrieve you.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.325
For this training, you have been supplied
with three days' worth of provisions.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.869
One, two, three, four...

11:44.370 --> 11:45.538
That's four days short!

11:45.746 --> 11:47.748
We'll be hungry.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.250
We might die.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.585
You must procure what you need
on your own, here.

11:51.669 --> 11:55.589
Keep in mind the main purpose is
to attempt to escape.

11:55.965 --> 11:56.799
That is all.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.062
What are you going to do, Hoshino?

12:10.521 --> 12:12.690
I'm riding the OTF back to base.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.651
What about the survival part?

12:17.319 --> 12:20.823
I'll get this training over with,
immediately.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.872
What's wrong?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.373
Does your tummy hurt?

12:29.623 --> 12:34.044
I see. We're not supposed
to use ordinary methods.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.297
Why won't you fly?

12:36.964 --> 12:39.550
What exactly... is going on?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.515
At last, it has begun.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.810
This is for the day that will come?

12:50.394 --> 12:51.228
Yes.

12:51.645 --> 12:55.649
For that purpose, they need to improve
their teamwork, and one more thing.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.818
They need to fulfill a condition.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.781
The emotions of those girls,
the White Lovers,

13:02.615 --> 13:06.076
must be warmed up, by the OTF,
no matter what they are,

13:06.911 --> 13:08.871
and incubate.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.044
Why won't they fly?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.338
Is this island cursed?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.881
Oh my...

13:19.256 --> 13:21.634
We have three days' worth of food.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.136
In that time, we must find out why--

13:35.314 --> 13:39.276
Oh, I didn't know dragons
ate people's food, too.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.946
Wait a minute!

13:42.029 --> 13:44.198
W-W-What are we gonna do?

13:44.281 --> 13:46.408
They won't retrieve us for a week!

13:46.700 --> 13:49.286
He ate all the rare metal, too.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.332
-How can it get any worse?
-Ah! Not the backpack!

13:53.415 --> 13:56.585
I've got something precious in here!

14:06.887 --> 14:08.013
What happened here?

14:08.973 --> 14:13.185
Nao, why won't Masotan and the others fly?

14:13.269 --> 14:16.689
"This ain't the time to be moping
about them not flying!"

14:17.356 --> 14:19.024
Then, what should I do?

14:19.316 --> 14:21.318
"Get your bearings together at first.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.280
Securing food and water should be
your first priority, dummy."

14:24.572 --> 14:25.865
You're right!

14:25.990 --> 14:28.909
We can't make strategy
on an empty stomach!

14:29.034 --> 14:30.119
Got it!

14:30.244 --> 14:31.495
Thanks, Nao!

14:35.749 --> 14:37.918
What are you doing, Hitomi?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.795
Dowsing.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.463
D-Dowsing?

14:41.755 --> 14:43.883
S-She's... crying.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.262
Futomomo ate everyone's food and water,

14:48.345 --> 14:51.265
so the least I can do is search for water.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.392
Yeah, I suppose so.

14:53.767 --> 14:57.605
Futomomo also ate all the rare metals.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.983
We should look for rare metals together.

15:01.358 --> 15:05.863
If there were rare metals here,
it would cause a territory dispute.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.824
Droves of suspicious boats would barge in.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.827
But then again, maybe we'd be saved...

15:12.369 --> 15:14.788
That's not to say,
you won't find rare metals!

15:14.872 --> 15:16.874
Nao is rooting for you, too!

15:17.082 --> 15:19.668
"You can do it, you can do it, Hitomi.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.796
You can do it, you can do it, Hitomi!''

15:22.963 --> 15:24.256
On that note.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.186
Are you taking a siesta?

15:37.519 --> 15:40.606
If they're coming in a week anyway,

15:40.773 --> 15:42.274
then I will just breathe.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.651
No, no, no.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.779
Kinutsugai, did you forget
the main point of the training?

15:47.196 --> 15:51.784
We were tasked with escaping the island
and returning to base, right?

15:52.409 --> 15:53.535
Impossible...

15:53.953 --> 15:57.289
Besides, we won't last a week
without water!

15:57.623 --> 15:59.625
-It'll rain.
-Huh?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.543
How do you know that?

16:02.544 --> 16:04.546
I did... a rain dance.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.340
Rain dance?

16:17.476 --> 16:19.186
As expected of you, Hoshino!

16:19.269 --> 16:21.397
Escape by raft, right?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.066
While it might not be much,
let me help you!

16:24.316 --> 16:28.904
Oh, but we'd need a considerably
bigger raft to transport the OTF.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.531
Aren't you being ridiculous?

16:31.365 --> 16:33.784
There's no way we can make a raft

16:34.118 --> 16:35.703
big enough to carry an OTF.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.997
So what do you plan on doing?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.124
It's assumed we're supposed
to escape by air,

16:40.207 --> 16:43.836
though, I don't know the reason
why the OTF can't fly anymore.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.047
S-So, all the more reason
to make a bigger raft.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.966
Weren't you listening?

16:49.883 --> 16:53.095
We weren't ordered to return with our OTF.

17:00.019 --> 17:06.108
<i>Leaving Masotan and the other OTF behind</i>
<i>while we escape is something I can't do.</i>

17:06.650 --> 17:09.862
<i>Even if Hoshino is right...</i>

17:18.412 --> 17:21.707
Now is when everyone's supposed
to work together.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.626
What's with this lack of solidarity?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.546
Hey, say something, Nao.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.631
"What the hell are you talking about?

17:29.715 --> 17:33.844
All you've done is make a fuss
and nothing else!"

17:34.678 --> 17:35.971
You're right.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.307
I haven't done anything.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.101
Ah, I'm thirsty.

17:41.935 --> 17:42.770
Okay.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.529
Everybody!

17:52.738 --> 17:55.157
Technical Sergeant Amakasu will embark

17:55.240 --> 17:58.786
on an excursion
to the north to find water.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.412
Who wants to join?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.459
I see.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.628
No one is answering as usual.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.089
Fine then. I'll go alone.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.970
Nothing, nothing. There's nothing here.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.440
I'm always spinning my wheels.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.077
Why are there torii gates here?

18:41.036 --> 18:43.789
Is this the entrance to the underworld?

18:44.581 --> 18:49.044
Is my life in this world
at an end, already?

18:49.753 --> 18:52.923
I wasted my energy, screamed and shouted,

18:53.465 --> 18:54.299
and yet now...

18:55.134 --> 18:57.845
my dream to become a Dragon Pilot
will never come true!

19:03.308 --> 19:04.226
Masotan?

19:20.367 --> 19:21.243
Masotan.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.204
What is this place?

19:25.414 --> 19:28.876
Did you come looking for me
because you were worried?

19:31.628 --> 19:34.882
Masotan!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.759
I love you!

19:40.971 --> 19:43.140
Masotan, you don't taste salty.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.185
You taste like delicious water.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.646
Everybody!

19:49.980 --> 19:53.734
I've made the discovery of the century!
I found a spring in the back of a cave!

19:56.695 --> 19:58.614
Ah, over here!

19:59.573 --> 20:00.991
Who made the fire?

20:01.116 --> 20:03.118
Kinutsugai started it for us.

20:03.660 --> 20:09.124
The key points for making a fire
are airflow creation and flammable tinder.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.711
Kinutsugai... for someone
who can't be bothered to do anything...

20:12.794 --> 20:14.796
How rude.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.840
I think it's about ready.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.343
Oh my gosh, is that a yam?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.054
Wild Japanese yam.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.056
Did you find it through dowsing?

20:24.348 --> 20:26.099
Yes, in some capacity.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.392
Here. Eat up!

20:31.980 --> 20:35.484
I have no right to eat that yam.

20:37.361 --> 20:41.448
I secretly held onto the hope
that everyone would fail

20:41.865 --> 20:44.201
and that there was no one
more hard-working than me.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.955
But in the end, everyone else
proved to be more useful.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.915
I didn't do a thing.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.501
You know,

20:52.918 --> 20:55.504
I always try to do my best,

20:55.671 --> 20:57.881
but I end up burdening others.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.717
I'm slow and dimwitted.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.302
Despite that,

21:02.469 --> 21:05.597
Futomomo still chose me.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.474
I was over the moon.

21:08.725 --> 21:12.312
That's why when Hoshino
spoke poorly of F-2,

21:12.479 --> 21:13.814
it made me so angry.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.984
I've never been so angry in my life.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.738
I didn't like myself in the first place,
and now even more so.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.742
It's the same with me.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.788
I don't want to be separated from Akemi,

21:29.871 --> 21:32.791
especially since I'm terrible
with human interaction.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.794
Hitomi... Kinutsugai...

21:45.095 --> 21:46.972
They look like they're having fun.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.056
Yeah.

21:48.557 --> 21:52.102
Hey, maybe we don't need to rush
back to base.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.020
What?

21:53.437 --> 21:56.481
Let them play to their hearts,
and when they get hungry,

21:56.565 --> 22:00.527
they'll say, "Let's go home!"
Maybe then, they will fly for us.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.528
Yeah!

22:02.070 --> 22:04.489
We'll figure out something
for food and water,

22:04.740 --> 22:07.784
and let Masotan and them
enjoy themselves for a week!

22:09.077 --> 22:10.329
I'm all for that.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.081
This is a good omen.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.293
The White Lovers have deepened their bond.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.046
That can be attributed
to the existence of the OTF.

22:19.713 --> 22:24.051
It seems the OTF have also recalled
memories of one another.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.803
However, El Hoshino is still...

22:28.305 --> 22:30.849
When she welcomes the OTF into her heart,

22:31.391 --> 22:34.186
a door will open to a new rule.

22:38.065 --> 22:42.569
I am not like you OTF zookeepers.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.780
I am an F-2 pilot!

22:45.489 --> 22:48.116
I'll prove that to you!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.951
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.500 --> 24:21.877
<i>The skin is...</i>

24:21.960 --> 24:23.503
<i>Shouldn't you peel that?</i>

24:23.587 --> 24:25.714
<i>It was so hot on the outside.</i>

24:25.797 --> 24:29.092
<i>-I'll lick you!</i>
<i>-This chivalry and clumsiness.</i>

24:29.176 --> 24:30.343
<i>Be one with him.</i>

24:30.427 --> 24:31.511
<i>Bang bang!</i>

24:31.928 --> 24:33.638
<i>It's quite expected.</i>

24:41.938 --> 24:44.941
