[woman] You know cars can
drive themselves now, right?

04:00.830 --> 04:04.598
[man] And you've asked me that question every
day for the six months we've worked together.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.834
'Cause you give me
the same answer every time.

04:06.836 --> 04:09.971
Yeah.
I don't trust them.

04:09.973 --> 04:11.739
You could just say
that you're old

04:11.741 --> 04:13.975
and technology
has passed you by.

04:13.977 --> 04:15.943
[laughs]

04:15.945 --> 04:19.447
Back in my day,
cars were things you drove,

04:19.449 --> 04:21.515
not the other way around.

04:21.517 --> 04:23.050
- Oh, that's good.
- [chuckles]

04:23.052 --> 04:25.219
Clearly we have spent
too much time together.

Hi, yes.
We're with Transitions.

05:26.516 --> 05:27.884
We have an appointment
with Charles?

05:41.197 --> 05:43.964

for the drug program.

05:43.966 --> 05:45.901
[grunts]

05:45.903 --> 05:49.507
They only... do so much.

05:53.610 --> 05:57.178
Cost money, and, uh,

05:57.180 --> 06:01.916
the result's the same
in the end.

06:01.918 --> 06:08.623
I wanted to stay, but my daughter...
It... It's time.

- There we go.

06:24.975 --> 06:26.511
[man] Hurts to leave.

06:27.877 --> 06:32.079

hurts more to stay.

[electronic humming]

06:34.651 --> 06:36.687
Can I use your restroom?

If this weren't my daddy's
last wish...

07:26.168 --> 07:28.305
I would have you arrested
for trespassing.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.177
Nothin' but a bunch
of glorified murderers.

07:34.911 --> 07:37.344
But you do
what you gotta do,

07:37.346 --> 07:41.315
and then you get up out of
this house, you hear me?

07:41.317 --> 07:42.620
Yeah.

07:50.894 --> 07:54.031
- [man speaking, indistinct]
- You're ready?

07:55.264 --> 07:56.930

08:28.165 --> 08:30.201
She called us
glorified murderers.

08:32.001 --> 08:35.673
Yeah, well, she's just trying
to process losing her father.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.238
And on that note, uh,

08:38.240 --> 08:42.111
you, uh, give any more
thought to my question?

08:43.413 --> 08:45.979
Not really.

08:45.981 --> 08:48.184
I still think
you're gonna beat it.

08:51.988 --> 08:53.691
[groans]

08:54.890 --> 08:56.993

[spits]

09:40.202 --> 09:42.804
- Did you see that?
- What?

09:42.806 --> 09:45.507
A planter drone just, like,
flew right up to me.

09:45.509 --> 09:47.307
Are you okay?

09:47.309 --> 09:49.511
Yeah. I just didn't think they
were supposed to work at night.

09:49.513 --> 09:50.781
They're not.

09:54.817 --> 09:57.050
You're not coming in?

09:57.052 --> 10:02.390
No. But check in. I think I'm
gonna go see if I can find a bar.

10:02.392 --> 10:05.026
Okay. I'm going to go to the store,
get something for my stomach.

10:05.028 --> 10:06.828
- You want anything?
- No.

10:06.830 --> 10:08.897
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Okay.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.333

13:34.336 --> 13:35.505
[man] So, um...

13:37.440 --> 13:39.473
Uh, something I need
to talk to you about.

13:39.475 --> 13:41.376
And it needs to stay
between us.

13:41.378 --> 13:45.579
I actually have something that
I wanna talk to you about too.

13:45.581 --> 13:47.614
Okay. Go first.

13:47.616 --> 13:49.385
Okay, um...

13:51.754 --> 13:54.488
[nervous chuckle]

13:54.490 --> 13:58.126
I just found out
that I'm pregnant,

13:58.128 --> 14:01.561
so... there's that.

14:01.563 --> 14:02.597
Pregnant?

14:02.599 --> 14:04.132
Yeah.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.036
So that's why
you've been sick, huh?

14:08.804 --> 14:11.104
- Is it...
- Yep.

14:11.106 --> 14:12.806
[scoffs] He's married.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.541
[sighs] I know.

14:14.543 --> 14:17.014
Kinda
complicates things.

14:19.783 --> 14:21.351
Yeah. Sure does.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.289
Claudia. Look at me.

14:28.057 --> 14:28.992
Look at me.

14:31.561 --> 14:33.795
You can't think about
where you're at right now.

14:33.797 --> 14:36.696
You need to think about
where you wanna be.

14:36.698 --> 14:38.168
Start at the ending.

14:39.568 --> 14:42.038
Pick yourself up and fight.

14:45.075 --> 14:46.310

Okay.

14:52.381 --> 14:55.416
[sniffles]

14:55.418 --> 14:57.453

talk to me about?

14:59.422 --> 15:00.557

worry about the company itself,</i>

19:20.583 --> 19:23.683
We received a fairly large

John passed away
last night.

22:02.845 --> 22:04.010
What?

22:04.012 --> 22:08.047
He transitioned himself.

22:08.049 --> 22:09.019
No.

22:11.186 --> 22:14.757
No-No. I-I was with
him last night.

22:16.192 --> 22:18.225
That wasn't his plan.

22:18.227 --> 22:22.529
I know. I wanted to
say good-bye too.

22:22.531 --> 22:24.864
But sometimes,
when people are that sick,

22:24.866 --> 22:28.602
their priorities can change
at a moment's notice.

22:28.604 --> 22:32.509
But at least he got to
go out on his terms.

22:33.843 --> 22:35.543
You two were close,

22:35.545 --> 22:37.113
so I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

22:39.015 --> 22:43.116
This is not the right time
to talk about work...

22:43.118 --> 22:46.319
[inhales] but I'm gonna need to get
you back in the field right away.

22:46.321 --> 22:50.157
So I'm gonna promote you
to John's role, okay?

22:50.159 --> 22:53.661
You know this whole thing can go
sideways if we don't get caught up.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.796
And you've seen those lists.

22:55.798 --> 22:58.535
Those people, they're sick,
and they need you, Claudia.

23:01.836 --> 23:02.771
So...

23:04.140 --> 23:05.542
what do you think?

23:06.741 --> 23:07.844
Okay.

23:09.244 --> 23:12.246
Good. I know what
John meant to you,

23:12.248 --> 23:14.518
so if there
was any other way...

23:53.221 --> 23:55.689
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

23:55.691 --> 23:56.893
I'm your new partner.

24:01.896 --> 24:04.097
You like your hands
on the wheel, huh?

24:04.099 --> 24:06.602
You know these cars
can drive themselves?

24:08.069 --> 24:09.172
I know.

24:10.905 --> 24:12.576
I'm doing it
for a friend.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.794
Hey, can I
borrow two credits?

24:32.394 --> 24:34.798
Do we not work
for the same company?

24:35.964 --> 24:37.600
[beeps]

24:38.233 --> 24:39.769
- [beeps]
- Thanks.

24:44.272 --> 24:46.609
I wonder where Jason'll
send you when I'm gone.

24:47.809 --> 24:49.410
I don't know.

24:49.412 --> 24:51.247
Probably have you
take over my region.

24:55.050 --> 24:56.984
I know one thing.

24:56.986 --> 24:58.822
He'll want to

25:40.762 --> 25:42.863
I was just checking the
details for the job today.

25:42.865 --> 25:45.399
There's sensitive medical
information in here.

25:45.401 --> 25:48.102
You'll get your own once you
pass the probationary period.

25:48.104 --> 25:50.673
Okay. Good to know.
Sorry.

25:53.375 --> 25:56.008
Were you and John close?

25:56.010 --> 25:58.511
Yeah.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.480
It must have been nice,

26:00.482 --> 26:02.418
having someone you could
share everything with.

Can anyone help?

27:30.873 --> 27:32.342
Sure. Yeah.

27:34.442 --> 27:39.513
So you're gonna wanna take this
road east about two or three miles,

27:42.852 --> 27:45.121

27:46.188 --> 27:48.057

to be that you do it

of helping others.

28:24.593 --> 28:27.894
It's not a job, you know.
It's not about money.

It's a compassionate
service.

28:30.231 --> 28:32.164

do exactly what was discussed.

Hey there.

30:15.738 --> 30:17.039
Say hello to our guests, Victor.

30:18.539 --> 30:20.276
Hello to our guests,
Victor.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.346
You're not John.

30:26.315 --> 30:29.583
You must have been driving a long time.
Can I offer you anything?

30:29.585 --> 30:31.988
No, no, no, we're fine.
Thank you.

30:35.723 --> 30:38.758
Is that your broken
drone outside?

30:38.760 --> 30:42.130
I thought I told you to put that
in the shed with the scrap metal.

30:43.699 --> 30:47.066
I hit it
with a baseball bat.

30:47.068 --> 30:48.604
Those things are evil.

30:49.538 --> 30:51.571
Why would you
say that?

30:51.573 --> 30:53.739
A few weeks ago,
I was out in the fields,

30:53.741 --> 30:57.376
and I asked God why
he made my father sick.

30:57.378 --> 31:00.313
- And he answered me.
- Victor.

31:00.315 --> 31:02.349
You know what?
We can give you a moment.

31:02.351 --> 31:05.151
He told me it's because he went against
God's work in nature by getting that drone.

31:05.153 --> 31:07.621
- Victor.
- Revelations 9:

31:07.623 --> 31:11.557
"And the shapes of the locusts were
like unto horses prepared unto battle,

31:11.559 --> 31:13.626
and on their heads appeared
to be crowns like gold,

31:13.628 --> 31:15.461
and their faces were
like the faces of men.

31:15.463 --> 31:16.662
They had breastplates of iron,

31:16.664 --> 31:19.432
and the sound of their wings
was like the sound of chariots,

31:19.434 --> 31:20.834
of many horses
rushing to battle.

31:20.836 --> 31:22.536
They have tails like
scorpions, and stings,

31:22.538 --> 31:25.173
and in their tails,
their power to hurt men."

31:27.576 --> 31:29.709
Sounds like they were
talking about drones.

31:29.711 --> 31:31.745
Ask around.

31:31.747 --> 31:34.648
Ain't no good come to
anyone who got a drone.

31:34.650 --> 31:38.485
Not the Dunn family,
not the Burgess family.

31:38.487 --> 31:41.220
I know there are others too.

31:41.222 --> 31:42.456
Something is happening.

31:42.458 --> 31:44.192
Well, then.

31:47.628 --> 31:48.663
He ain't right
in the head.

31:49.431 --> 31:50.767
It's okay.

31:55.570 --> 31:56.505
[door slams]

31:59.141 --> 32:00.209
Excuse me
a moment.

32:33.407 --> 32:34.376

32:37.346 --> 32:40.083
[sniffs] He gave
me this last week.

32:42.183 --> 32:43.618
It was his daddy's too.

32:49.758 --> 32:51.427
This is really nice.

32:59.701 --> 33:02.672
For me, growing up...

33:07.209 --> 33:11.447
my home life was...
absolute crap.

33:15.550 --> 33:17.819
Just like the worst.

33:21.656 --> 33:22.692
Here.

33:33.535 --> 33:34.836
When I was 12...

33:38.272 --> 33:39.774
my father killed himself.

33:43.878 --> 33:45.180
And...

33:49.483 --> 33:51.853
I tried to do the same
ten years later.

33:56.857 --> 33:59.162
To be honest, I've been
struggling ever since.

34:01.930 --> 34:04.200
Your father,
on the other hand...

34:08.002 --> 34:10.338
Seems like
he was there for you.

34:14.876 --> 34:16.210
So...

34:18.614 --> 34:21.284
don't you think you should
maybe be there for him...

34:22.617 --> 34:24.619
now that he needs you
the most?

34:35.731 --> 34:36.831
[sighs]

34:40.302 --> 34:44.036
[Claudia] Our process uses a
combination of inert gases,

34:44.039 --> 34:48.411
delivered via the Transitions
apparatus and this mask.

34:50.045 --> 34:54.679
These gases prevent the
hypercapnic alarm response,

34:54.681 --> 34:59.588
which, basically, is the panic you
feel when you can't breathe...

35:01.489 --> 35:05.624
and will make Abner's
transition calm and peaceful,

35:05.626 --> 35:10.699
like falling asleep into the
best dream you can imagine.

35:13.768 --> 35:17.239
It's simple
and it's painless.

35:19.974 --> 35:21.777
Are you with me so far?

35:25.780 --> 35:26.949
Okay.

35:30.518 --> 35:32.918
Is there any music he likes?
I could play...

35:32.920 --> 35:38.426
He likes bluegrass, country,
that sort of stuff.

35:40.461 --> 35:41.697

41:44.092 --> 41:45.193
Sure.

41:51.865 --> 41:53.802
[baby fussing]

41:57.938 --> 41:59.104
Here you go.

41:59.106 --> 42:00.375
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:07.181 --> 42:08.750
[cooing]

42:10.050 --> 42:13.221
[baby cries]

42:43.985 --> 42:44.987
[electronic beep]

42:48.757 --> 42:50.188
Hey!

42:50.190 --> 42:52.525
Geez.
You scared me.

42:52.527 --> 42:54.459
Give a girl a little
warning next time, huh?

42:54.461 --> 42:56.829
What the hell
are you doing?

42:56.831 --> 43:01.434
I... feel really bad about
my screw-up earlier today,

43:01.436 --> 43:03.401
and I just wanted
to come and double-check

43:03.403 --> 43:06.371
that my paperwork was all filled out
correctly 'cause I was a little out of it.

43:06.373 --> 43:08.342
What did I tell you
about that tablet?

43:10.277 --> 43:12.880
You're right. I am such an idiot.
I'm so sorry.

43:14.014 --> 43:15.514
And you broke
into my room?

43:15.516 --> 43:17.416
No. No, no, no.

43:17.418 --> 43:20.153
I came over here to talk to you about
it, and your door was wide open.

43:20.155 --> 43:22.191
- And...
- You need to get out.

43:25.393 --> 43:27.295
Okay.

43:41.442 --> 43:45.481
[electrical crackling]

43:49.317 --> 43:51.487
- [gasps]
- [alarm beeping]

43:52.887 --> 43:54.189
[beeping stops]

44:02.163 --> 44:03.465
[beeps, chimes]

44:31.125 --> 44:33.559
[sighs, clears throat]

44:33.561 --> 44:35.364
Excuse me.

44:37.231 --> 44:38.800
Thanks.

44:44.072 --> 44:47.273
- [tapping buttons]
- Scan whenever you're ready.

44:47.275 --> 44:49.244
[beeping, whirs]

44:52.512 --> 44:53.981
[chimes]

44:58.286 --> 45:00.286
Your scan was declined.

45:00.288 --> 45:03.858
Um, I'm sorry.
Can I try again?

45:05.659 --> 45:07.994
[beeps, chimes]

45:07.996 --> 45:09.530
Sorry. Same result.

45:14.302 --> 45:16.068
I'm-I'm sure
it's my fault.

45:16.070 --> 45:19.170
Um, I have, like, this.

45:19.172 --> 45:20.474
Sorry.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.879
[machinery whirs]

45:32.286 --> 45:34.387
- [chimes]
- [Ami] <i>Excuse me, Claudia,</i>

45:34.389 --> 45:37.123
<i>but it appears you're headed
in the wrong direction.</i>

45:37.125 --> 45:39.425
- <i>Would you like me to take over?</i>
- Ami, please mute.

45:39.427 --> 45:41.230
- [chimes]
- <i>Okay.</i>

46:00.648 --> 46:02.184
[gasps]

46:51.331 --> 46:53.766
[gasping]

46:53.768 --> 46:57.005
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

47:04.211 --> 47:05.547
Ah.

47:10.083 --> 47:12.751
- No.
- [beeps]

47:12.753 --> 47:14.655
- [chimes]
- [crying]

47:16.157 --> 47:18.527
Hello? I'd like
to report a fire.

47:50.757 --> 47:53.325
<i>I have detected traffic
in the wrong lane.</i>

47:53.327 --> 47:56.431
- Come on. Come on.
- <i>Would you like me to take over?</i>

47:59.400 --> 48:01.036
Oh!

48:18.485 --> 48:20.054
Hey!

48:21.088 --> 48:22.456
Hey!

48:23.557 --> 48:25.760
Why are you following me?

48:27.260 --> 48:29.095
<i>Communication error.</i>

48:29.097 --> 48:30.829
<i>Communication error.</i>

48:30.831 --> 48:32.831
<i>Communication error.</i>

48:32.833 --> 48:34.833
<i>Communication error.</i>

48:34.835 --> 48:37.204
- <i>Communication error.</i>
- Damn it.

49:42.302 --> 49:43.404
- What you doing here?
- [gasps]

49:45.373 --> 49:49.807
Victor is dead, and I-I
think someone's after me.

49:49.809 --> 49:51.677
Did you call the police?

49:51.679 --> 49:54.679
- I couldn't get through.
- Good.

49:54.681 --> 49:56.417
Can't trust them either.

50:02.889 --> 50:04.492
[sighs]

50:06.360 --> 50:09.597
John said... said
nice things about you.

50:10.630 --> 50:12.701
You talked to him recently?

50:14.835 --> 50:16.501
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

50:16.503 --> 50:19.507
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I just feel dizzy.

50:21.541 --> 50:23.608
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! Oh. Here, let me help you.

50:23.610 --> 50:25.744
- I'm sorry.
- You're gonna be okay.

50:25.746 --> 50:27.449
I think
I should lay down.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.469
[chattering, faint]

51:30.277 --> 51:32.646
[chattering continues]

51:59.039 --> 52:00.842
[chattering continues]

52:09.717 --> 52:12.454
[Joanna] I think it has something
to do with when she moves.

52:14.688 --> 52:17.088
Some kind of hybrids
maybe.

52:17.090 --> 52:19.791
[man] It's almost like
somebody circled them...

52:19.793 --> 52:21.629
[Joanna]
Some kind of formula?

52:23.331 --> 52:24.963
[man continues, faint]

52:24.965 --> 52:27.001
Well, you slept
for quite a while.

52:28.436 --> 52:30.605
Claudia,
this is Isaiah.

52:32.039 --> 52:33.575
Yeah.

52:35.409 --> 52:36.845
I believe we've met.

52:41.648 --> 52:43.981
This is
John's handwriting.

52:43.983 --> 52:46.552
Yeah.

52:46.554 --> 52:48.387
Where did you get it?

52:48.389 --> 52:50.557
He left it here for me.

52:52.025 --> 52:53.594
Okay.

52:56.697 --> 52:59.798
When all the other farmers
started getting sick,

52:59.800 --> 53:02.403
we started
comparing notes.

53:04.972 --> 53:07.509
People all over the region
have been getting sick.

53:08.943 --> 53:13.479
Cancer and tumors, blood
clots and birth defects.

53:13.481 --> 53:15.383
Fathers and mothers.

53:17.585 --> 53:20.387
Children and aunts
and uncles and neighbors.

53:24.023 --> 53:26.791
And Transition
employees.

53:26.793 --> 53:29.394
But why don't other people
know about this?

53:29.396 --> 53:30.963
Why haven't you
told anyone?

53:30.965 --> 53:32.965
Victor knew.

53:32.967 --> 53:35.070
You saw how that ended.

53:37.003 --> 53:38.639
Who would have done that?

53:43.978 --> 53:47.412
Why don't we plan
a little drive

53:47.414 --> 53:49.683
so you can see
for yourself.

53:51.918 --> 53:53.520
We're the good guys,
Claudia.

54:00.494 --> 54:02.063
[chopping]

54:09.103 --> 54:10.538
Bud.

54:13.940 --> 54:15.843
Hey, Joanna, Isaiah.

54:20.114 --> 54:22.447
[Bud] My wife first
started showing symptoms

54:22.449 --> 54:24.985
about six months after we
signed our lease with VastGrow.

54:27.086 --> 54:29.688
Strong history of pancreatic
cancer in her family,

54:29.690 --> 54:33.427
so when the diagnosis came in,
we weren't all that surprised.

54:35.896 --> 54:38.400
And four or five months
later, she was gone.

54:39.733 --> 54:41.867
She sure
was something.

54:41.869 --> 54:45.070
Remember how she used to carry
an acorn around in her pocket?

54:45.072 --> 54:47.005
Old wives' tale.

54:47.007 --> 54:50.445
You put an acorn in your
pocket, you never grow old.

54:51.911 --> 54:55.716
Yeah. She believed
all that old mumbo jumbo.

54:56.851 --> 54:58.519
I sure do miss her.

55:00.653 --> 55:01.989
Me too.

55:08.528 --> 55:10.130
We should go inside.

55:12.065 --> 55:14.833
<i>And then, uh,</i>

55:14.835 --> 55:17.038
Greta was diagnosed
three months later.

55:19.273 --> 55:22.139
I didn't think I could
go through it again,

55:22.141 --> 55:24.913
but she was strong.

55:25.945 --> 55:27.144
For me.

55:27.146 --> 55:28.817
Not for her.

55:29.884 --> 55:30.818
For me.

55:32.219 --> 55:36.023
Greta. Is that an aunt...
or grandmother?

55:42.762 --> 55:45.032
Greta?
Can you come say hello?

55:48.068 --> 55:50.004
[footsteps]

55:52.940 --> 55:55.043
[Joanna] There she is.
[chuckling]

55:56.277 --> 55:58.213
Greta, I'd like you
to meet Claudia.

55:59.914 --> 56:01.783
Hi there.

56:02.715 --> 56:04.950
Wow.

56:04.952 --> 56:07.055
Look at your pony.

56:08.088 --> 56:10.525
I even made
the tail myself.

56:12.326 --> 56:14.195
She makes me
feel better.

56:16.063 --> 56:17.795
Do you wanna hold her?

56:17.797 --> 56:19.700
Yeah, I'd love that.

56:21.601 --> 56:22.769
Thanks.

56:25.606 --> 56:27.639
You know what?

56:27.641 --> 56:29.907
I think
I feel better already.

56:29.909 --> 56:32.577
[Joanna chuckles]

56:32.579 --> 56:34.278
[clears throat]
Mr. Dunn.

56:34.280 --> 56:37.682
Uh... would you mind
telling Claudia

56:37.684 --> 56:40.521
why you don't just
get rid of the drone?

56:41.621 --> 56:43.354
Well, we don't own it,
of course.

56:43.356 --> 56:46.860
We had to take out a second mortgage
for the lease down payment.

56:48.161 --> 56:50.795
And because
of the technology involved,

56:50.797 --> 56:52.599
the crops are all patented
to VastGrow.

56:53.733 --> 56:56.601
We don't own squat.

56:56.603 --> 56:58.539
And what happens
if you default?

56:59.239 --> 57:01.108
VastGrow takes over.

57:28.268 --> 57:31.105
[beeping]

58:00.266 --> 58:02.336
[rapid beeping]

58:07.440 --> 58:10.275
The farm drones are
designed to be autonomous.

58:10.277 --> 58:12.744
You give them the coordinates
of a given farm field,

58:12.746 --> 58:15.780
then they will automatically deliver the
perfect amount of fertilizer and pesticide

58:15.782 --> 58:17.215
to the soil.

58:17.217 --> 58:21.318
Now, we're talkin'
down to the square foot.

58:21.320 --> 58:23.155
And they can even
kill pests...

58:23.157 --> 58:26.324
bugs, mice, rabbits,
whatever...

58:26.326 --> 58:28.693
by generating radio waves

58:28.695 --> 58:33.164
that agitate water molecules
much like a-a microwave oven.

58:33.166 --> 58:34.932
[buzzing]

58:34.934 --> 58:36.901
Cooks 'em
from the inside.

58:36.903 --> 58:38.072
It's, uh...

58:40.039 --> 58:42.441
It's really amazing stuff.

58:42.443 --> 58:44.309
Now,

58:44.311 --> 58:50.882
these new Sentinel drones
are even crazier.

58:50.884 --> 58:53.050
Developed with
the Department of Defense

58:53.052 --> 58:56.420
to monitor forward-operating
bases in hostile environments.

58:56.422 --> 58:59.324
Reconnaissance
and submission.

58:59.326 --> 59:01.325
Submission?

59:01.327 --> 59:03.762
Yeah.

59:03.764 --> 59:07.164
And now they're being marketed as
a property owner's best friend.

59:07.166 --> 59:10.068
I mean, we knew
that the-the drones

59:10.070 --> 59:12.336
were the root cause
of all these issues,

59:12.338 --> 59:15.373
but we just didn't have anything
concrete to back it up.

59:15.375 --> 59:19.144
And now VastGrow is trying to destroy
anybody that's onto the story.

59:19.146 --> 59:21.313
And that's where
John comes in.

59:21.315 --> 59:26.985
He said that he had proof that could
tie the-the deaths to the drones.

59:26.987 --> 59:29.186
His notebook.

59:29.188 --> 59:32.490
Well, we thought these
numbers meant something,

59:32.492 --> 59:34.295
but, well, we couldn't
figure it out.

59:44.771 --> 59:47.371
Wait, these look like
Transitions' client numbers.

59:47.373 --> 59:48.875
[Joanna] Oh.

59:52.445 --> 59:54.248
I'll be right back.

01:00:00.153 --> 01:00:02.789
[door opens, closes]

01:00:07.126 --> 01:00:09.193
Okay.

01:00:09.195 --> 01:00:13.034
What if these numbers were Transitions'
clients that also had a drone?

01:00:20.039 --> 01:00:21.208
- [chimes]
- [typing]

01:00:22.108 --> 01:00:23.311
[chimes]

01:00:24.811 --> 01:00:27.077
Reginald Jones.
Proctor County.

01:00:27.079 --> 01:00:28.880
Mmm.
Doesn't ring a bell.

01:00:28.882 --> 01:00:31.284
I don't even know where
Proctor County is. Isaiah?

01:00:32.251 --> 01:00:34.286
- Um...
- [typing]

01:00:34.288 --> 01:00:36.822
Margaret Fisher.
Ramsey County.

01:00:36.824 --> 01:00:37.759
Mm-mmm.

01:00:38.525 --> 01:00:40.090
Mm-mmm.

01:00:40.092 --> 01:00:41.892
Um...

01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:44.095
- [chimes]
- William Cook. Los Angeles County.

01:00:44.097 --> 01:00:47.499
That's nowhere
near here, Claudia.

01:00:47.501 --> 01:00:51.503
Yeah, you're right.
It just... doesn't add up.

01:00:51.505 --> 01:00:54.242
Uh, it feels like
we're moving backwards.

01:00:56.242 --> 01:01:00.244
You know,
John always said,

01:01:00.246 --> 01:01:02.847
"When you have a problem,

01:01:02.849 --> 01:01:05.217
look at where you want
to end up,

01:01:05.219 --> 01:01:07.355
not where you begin.

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:11.958
Start at the ending."

01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:16.461
[typing]

01:01:16.463 --> 01:01:18.229
[chimes]

01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:21.032
James Hilborn.
Polk County.

01:01:21.034 --> 01:01:22.867
Bingo.

01:01:22.869 --> 01:01:25.070
[chimes]

01:01:25.072 --> 01:01:27.005
Mark Bolton.
Jefferson County.

01:01:27.007 --> 01:01:31.041
Uh, that's two counties over, but John
used to spend a lot of time there.

01:01:31.043 --> 01:01:32.879
Mm-hmm.

01:01:33.914 --> 01:01:35.249
[chimes]

01:01:36.983 --> 01:01:39.251
[sniffles] Abner Smith.
Polk County.

01:01:39.253 --> 01:01:41.952
[Joanna]
Oh! Victor's father.

01:01:41.954 --> 01:01:43.988
John signed them up.

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:46.023
[Joanna] Mmm.

01:01:46.025 --> 01:01:47.525
[Claudia] God.

01:01:47.527 --> 01:01:50.327
There's hundreds
of numbers here.

01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:54.231
It's gotta be his entire client
list from the last couple of years.

01:01:54.233 --> 01:01:57.969
Either everyone who signed up
randomly had a drone or...

01:01:57.971 --> 01:02:02.673
Or you were only being sent to transition
people who were dying from them.

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:05.145
That's a big coincidence.

01:02:08.949 --> 01:02:11.182
If I had to guess,

01:02:11.184 --> 01:02:14.985
you and John were being sent
to clean up VastGrow's mess.

01:02:14.987 --> 01:02:17.155
And who better
to bury the mess

01:02:17.157 --> 01:02:20.525
than a company that was literally
allowed to do exactly that?

01:02:20.527 --> 01:02:23.394
No, no, our clients
sign up voluntarily.

01:02:23.396 --> 01:02:27.434
Yeah, but, okay, who assigned
you the actual client?

01:02:29.635 --> 01:02:31.172
Jason.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:34.909
- My boss.
- Hmm.

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:39.447
Oh, my God.

01:02:41.547 --> 01:02:43.682
John knew, and they
killed him, didn't they?

01:02:43.684 --> 01:02:46.284
I guess that's why
he left his book for us.

01:02:46.286 --> 01:02:47.922
What do we do?

01:02:49.088 --> 01:02:52.289
Well, we-we gotta
get the word out.

01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:55.025
- Shine a light on it.
- There's a press conference tomorrow.

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:56.961
They're breaking ground
on a new factory

01:02:56.963 --> 01:02:58.599
over at the old mill
down in Wilson.

01:03:00.032 --> 01:03:02.599
- Yeah, I know it.
- Anna Cook will be there.

01:03:02.601 --> 01:03:04.970
All the bigwigs. There'll
be cameras everywhere.

01:03:04.972 --> 01:03:07.375
I say we go there
and we make a scene.

01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:25.091
[sighs]
Here you go.

01:03:27.094 --> 01:03:28.461
Thank you.

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:33.130
How do you know Joanna?

01:03:33.132 --> 01:03:35.235
I met Joanna...

01:03:37.336 --> 01:03:39.105
at my dad's funeral.

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:44.309
Once she found out I was working
at the drone repair facility,

01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:46.314
she started working me
for answers.

01:03:48.715 --> 01:03:50.985
And then she
introduced you to John?

01:03:53.353 --> 01:03:54.688
Yeah.

01:04:02.528 --> 01:04:05.231
I'm so sorry about that.

01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:09.336
Maybe tomorrow
we can make things right.

01:04:35.528 --> 01:04:38.063
Oh. Look at you.

01:04:38.065 --> 01:04:41.166
I knew that
was gonna fit you.

01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:43.068
[chuckling]
Have a seat.

01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:44.635
- Would you like some tea?
- Sure. Thank you.

01:04:44.637 --> 01:04:45.706
Okay.

01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.279
Thank you.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.081
[sighs]

01:04:57.083 --> 01:04:59.150
I'm glad you're here.

01:04:59.152 --> 01:05:00.588
Me too.

01:05:13.766 --> 01:05:16.036
Isaiah,
you know the plan.

01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:21.840
Now, get the book.
Get out of here.

01:05:21.842 --> 01:05:23.744
Both of you, go, now!

01:05:29.181 --> 01:05:31.084
[beeping]

01:05:57.878 --> 01:06:00.478
Take this. Go into the
trees, and we'll find you.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.246
- What?
- Go! Go into the trees.

01:06:02.248 --> 01:06:04.117
She's gonna stall 'em!

01:06:45.659 --> 01:06:47.561
[whimpers]

01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:59.572
[whimpers]

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:07.313
[cries out, screams]

01:07:51.023 --> 01:07:52.393

- [grunting]

01:09:00.894 --> 01:09:03.593
Are you okay?
Look at me. Look at me.

01:09:03.595 --> 01:09:05.598
Are you okay?
[sighs]

01:09:12.572 --> 01:09:14.906
This is a remote handle.

01:09:14.908 --> 01:09:17.508
We use them at the shop to
move the bigger drones around.

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:20.544
But it only works
on one drone at a time

01:09:20.546 --> 01:09:22.479
and at a very close range.

01:09:22.481 --> 01:09:23.817
Where's Joanna?

01:09:26.786 --> 01:09:30.420
Look, we need
to get out of here.

01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:32.522
There's more comin'.
Come on.

01:09:32.524 --> 01:09:34.027
Come on.

01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:01.755
All right. They're here.

01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:04.358
What are you doing?

01:10:05.591 --> 01:10:07.493
Just keep going.

01:10:30.048 --> 01:10:31.819
[beeping]

01:10:44.596 --> 01:10:47.130
[beeping]

01:10:47.132 --> 01:10:48.935
[gasps]

01:11:02.614 --> 01:11:05.018
[groaning]

01:11:10.489 --> 01:11:11.824
They're leaving!

01:11:55.134 --> 01:11:56.170
Oh, shit.

01:12:09.615 --> 01:12:11.150
Hold onto something.

01:12:16.088 --> 01:12:17.724
[beeping]

01:12:39.746 --> 01:12:41.648

01:12:43.015 --> 01:12:44.116
[beeping]

01:12:59.064 --> 01:13:01.031
We're almost there.

01:13:01.033 --> 01:13:02.900
Great!

01:13:02.902 --> 01:13:07.106
I'll keep these two alive,
and we'll hand deliver 'em!

01:13:10.842 --> 01:13:14.210
We believe that every field,
whether fallow or abundant,

01:13:14.212 --> 01:13:17.748
can reach its fullest potential,
and that's why we're here today.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:20.684
This old mill behind us
and the ground it rests upon

01:13:20.686 --> 01:13:23.086
has brighter days ahead.

01:13:23.088 --> 01:13:27.693
The old and abandoned will
transition to the new and useful.

01:13:29.162 --> 01:13:32.964
This state-of-the-art
drone manufacturing facility

01:13:32.966 --> 01:13:34.568
will increase our...

01:13:42.641 --> 01:13:44.711
What the living fuck?

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.981
- Are you okay?
- You got this.

01:13:49.983 --> 01:13:51.585
Coming through!

01:13:55.154 --> 01:13:57.090
[electrical crackling]

01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:10.134
Hey! Be careful.

01:14:10.136 --> 01:14:12.068
Are you okay?

01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.938
- Gotta get her out of here.
- How could you?

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.842
Come on, let's go!

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.722
[groaning]
Oh, come on!

01:14:31.724 --> 01:14:32.990
Come on.

01:14:32.992 --> 01:14:35.028
[grunting]

01:14:39.865 --> 01:14:41.167
[shouting]

01:14:42.769 --> 01:14:45.135
[grunts] Come on!

01:14:45.137 --> 01:14:47.004
[beeping]

01:14:47.006 --> 01:14:49.943

01:14:52.979 --> 01:14:54.314

01:15:20.305 --> 01:15:25.111
[shouting]

01:15:37.457 --> 01:15:38.959
[door closes]

01:15:44.197 --> 01:15:45.699
[door closes]

01:15:48.434 --> 01:15:51.134
Claudia, I'm so glad to see
that you're okay.

01:15:51.136 --> 01:15:54.071
But what is going on?
Hmm?

01:15:54.073 --> 01:15:56.109
I know everything.

01:15:58.110 --> 01:16:00.210
John was onto you too,
and you had him murdered.

01:16:00.212 --> 01:16:02.312
[scoffs]

01:16:02.314 --> 01:16:05.116
And those poor farmers.

01:16:05.118 --> 01:16:09.053
We were fulfilling a mission. Those
people are sick, and they need our help.

01:16:09.055 --> 01:16:11.388
That's bullshit.

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:13.260
It was a transaction.

01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:18.361
- Wh-What am I supposed to do?
- I'll handle it.

01:16:18.363 --> 01:16:21.065
The police
will be here soon.

01:16:21.067 --> 01:16:22.069
Okay.

01:16:24.036 --> 01:16:25.271
Hey, Jason.

01:16:32.011 --> 01:16:34.448
Actually, never mind.
You don't deserve to know.

01:16:45.992 --> 01:16:47.894
I know who you are too.

01:16:49.929 --> 01:16:53.199
I'd hope so. The amount
we spend on advertising.

01:16:54.332 --> 01:16:56.366
Listen.

01:16:56.368 --> 01:16:58.402
I understand what you
might be thinking,

01:16:58.404 --> 01:17:01.871
but look at it
from our perspective, hmm?

01:17:01.873 --> 01:17:06.177
Sixty-two percent of our planet is in
the midst of a catastrophic drought.

01:17:06.179 --> 01:17:09.879
Countless people have either died
or been displaced because of it.

01:17:09.881 --> 01:17:13.584
Our technology is giving
these people a chance.

01:17:13.586 --> 01:17:17.888
We have literally saved
millions of lives.

01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:21.392
Uh, no one is happy
that a handful of farmers

01:17:21.394 --> 01:17:24.495
saw some... unfortunate
side effects,

01:17:24.497 --> 01:17:26.196
but do the fucking math.

01:17:26.198 --> 01:17:30.300
VastGrow
is saving the world.

01:17:30.302 --> 01:17:32.468
What about all those people
you had killed?

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:35.873
Oh, grow up.

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:40.844
This is the way of the world, and to think
otherwise just shows how naive you really are.

01:17:40.846 --> 01:17:42.849
Do you think
what we do is easy?

01:17:47.153 --> 01:17:49.919
Those are human beings

01:17:49.921 --> 01:17:53.424
with hopes and-and dreams
and families.

01:17:53.426 --> 01:17:55.491
And you're killing them.

01:17:55.493 --> 01:17:58.264
Our drones are autonomous.
They're just doing their job.

01:18:00.399 --> 01:18:03.133
I get it.

01:18:03.135 --> 01:18:05.201
You're trying to fight
the good fight.

01:18:05.203 --> 01:18:08.238
It is very admirable,
truly.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.110
But this is bigger
than you, hmm?

01:18:13.179 --> 01:18:16.382
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to my press conference.

01:18:23.622 --> 01:18:25.858
