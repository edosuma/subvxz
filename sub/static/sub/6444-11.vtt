WEBVTT

00:03.165 --> 00:07.114
Not the headline I was hoping for
a week before the election.

00:07.395 --> 00:10.809
Nobody's that squeaky-clean.
We'll find something to use against him.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.943
You've never met Jonathan Kent.

00:12.945 --> 00:14.965
Mr. Luthor?

00:14.985 --> 00:17.429
- We need to get you out of here.
- What's going on?

00:17.535 --> 00:19.888
There's been a bomb threat.
We need to evacuate.

00:20.035 --> 00:24.206
- A bomb?
- My security didn't alert me about this.

00:30.045 --> 00:31.732
Lex?

00:33.885 --> 00:36.450
You always gotta do things
the hard way, don't you?

00:36.595 --> 00:38.655
Let me guess, you're not a cop.

00:38.925 --> 00:40.400
Not anymore.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.082
Stop him.

00:54.235 --> 00:56.174
<i>At the risk of stating the obvious...</i>

00:57.075 --> 01:00.024
but whatever game
you think you're playing...

01:00.825 --> 01:03.481
you just lost.

01:03.575 --> 01:06.615
If you're trying the hard-wire,
good luck.

01:06.745 --> 01:10.664
<i>I cut it a half-hour ago. Right around
the time I set up the wireless scrambler.</i>

01:10.795 --> 01:13.280
Looks like the game is just starting.

01:15.795 --> 01:18.997
- What do you want?
- I'll give you a hint.

01:19.215 --> 01:20.649
It's big...

01:20.805 --> 01:23.421
<i>metallic,
it came from outer space.</i>

01:23.555 --> 01:25.828
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:29.025 --> 01:30.449
<i>Sure you do.</i>

01:32.605 --> 01:35.645
<i>I want that ship
that landed in the meteor shower.</i>

01:35.775 --> 01:40.663
<i>Or that room is gonna be your coffin,
Luthor.</i>

02:44.845 --> 02:49.612
Okay, so when you said,
"Let's get together and study"

02:49.725 --> 02:52.169
you actually meant study.

02:56.905 --> 02:58.420
Kiss me.

03:09.035 --> 03:12.025
Clark, what am I, your cousin?

03:12.335 --> 03:14.062
Really kiss me.

03:28.515 --> 03:32.181
I gotta go. I don't wanna miss class.

03:32.315 --> 03:34.295
Wouldn't want you
to be late for class.

03:34.435 --> 03:37.091
- Lana, come on.
- Clark, what is it?

03:37.235 --> 03:40.225
When we kiss, when we really kiss...

03:40.365 --> 03:44.486
I can feel how much you want me.
Why can't we just be together?

03:44.785 --> 03:46.421
It's complicated.

03:47.825 --> 03:49.683
It shouldn't be.

03:49.825 --> 03:52.188
Not when you love somebody.

03:57.045 --> 03:58.772
Lana, wait.

04:09.725 --> 04:11.371
What is this?

04:12.815 --> 04:14.199
Nothing.

04:17.355 --> 04:18.829
Did you get this from Lex?

04:20.524 --> 04:25.030
We've been researching it together
for the last couple of weeks.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.681
Why would you keep this from me?

04:30.535 --> 04:32.434
Because, Clark...

04:32.575 --> 04:36.837
every time I try to bring up the ship
I saw, you change the subject.

04:39.085 --> 04:42.287
Just don't think there's any point
in dwelling on it.

04:45.755 --> 04:49.553
I saw what came out of that ship.

04:50.555 --> 04:53.040
I watched them kill
all those police officers.

04:55.645 --> 04:58.675
I almost died,
and all you can say to me is:

04:58.815 --> 05:01.219
"There's no point in dwelling on it"?

05:08.285 --> 05:11.315
I turned to Lex because he wants
to find out the truth...

05:13.875 --> 05:15.935
not avoid it.

05:26.005 --> 05:27.823
A spaceship?

05:27.965 --> 05:31.803
Have you tried the amusement park?
They have one you can ride for a dollar.

05:31.885 --> 05:34.885
I know you took that ship
after the meteor shower, Luthor.

05:34.975 --> 05:37.288
You do realize
how crazy you sound right now.

05:37.645 --> 05:41.059
Does this look crazy to you?

05:42.145 --> 05:43.620
<i>I was there.</i>

05:44.065 --> 05:47.691
<i>I was part of the Sheriff's Response
Team that got wiped out.</i>

05:48.235 --> 05:52.578
I was under my cruiser, half dead.

05:52.705 --> 05:55.018
<i>I saw you roll up
with your equipment and men.</i>

05:55.125 --> 05:58.741
<i>You didn 't even bother to see
if anybody was still alive.</i>

05:59.335 --> 06:02.537
All you cared about
was hauling that ship away.

06:03.215 --> 06:05.993
Sorry, but I still don't know
what you're talking about.

06:06.085 --> 06:09.287
<i>You're going to make a great politician,
Luthor.</i>

06:09.425 --> 06:12.203
<i>You almost sound like you believe
your own lies.</i>

06:12.475 --> 06:14.788
You want to make it to Election Day?

06:14.895 --> 06:17.289
- Tell me what I want to know.
- "Or what?"

06:17.435 --> 06:21.647
I had this room designed after that
little incident at the missile silo.

06:21.775 --> 06:25.098
These walls can withstand
a nuclear blast. You'll never get in here.

06:25.195 --> 06:26.831
<i>And you'll never get out.</i>

06:26.945 --> 06:29.723
Your security team's tied up
in the basement.

06:29.865 --> 06:31.420
<i>Your wireless system 's blocked.</i>

06:31.575 --> 06:34.060
<i>You won 't be sending up
any smoke signals for help.</i>

06:35.035 --> 06:37.308
Looks like we have ourselves
a stalemate.

06:38.705 --> 06:41.442
Well, I guess I'll have to find
a way to break it.

06:45.875 --> 06:48.158
Lana's helping Lex
study the black ship?

06:48.295 --> 06:50.487
She's got a detailed drawing from
LuthorCorp.

06:50.595 --> 06:52.443
She's been lying to me for weeks.

06:52.595 --> 06:55.625
Well, you haven't exactly been honest
with her either, Clark.

06:55.765 --> 06:59.219
Sometimes the truth isn't easy to share
with the one you love.

06:59.305 --> 07:01.244
Especially if you think it might hurt.

07:01.355 --> 07:04.425
Everything was so perfect with Lana
when I lost my abilities.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.848
Now that I have them back,
all I do is lie to her.

07:07.985 --> 07:11.611
About the ship, about why l...

07:11.945 --> 07:13.379
I just wish I could tell her.

07:13.495 --> 07:16.444
I'm not saying you should,
but Pete found out, and Chloe...

07:16.575 --> 07:18.646
and they accepted you
for who you are.

07:18.785 --> 07:21.775
- Yeah. I'm an alien.
- No, as their friend.

07:21.915 --> 07:25.198
Whom they love very much no matter
what star you were born under.

07:25.335 --> 07:27.900
Just not sure Lana's gonna feel
the same way.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.874
Then maybe she's not the one
you were meant to be with.

07:33.345 --> 07:36.042
Mom, I can't imagine
ever loving anyone else.

07:40.225 --> 07:42.710
Hey, Smallville, Mrs. Kent.

07:43.855 --> 07:47.350
Have you guys seen the future senator?
It's crunch time.

07:47.445 --> 07:51.233
- We've got some billionaire butt to kick.
- I think he's in the barn, Lois.

07:51.945 --> 07:55.147
Salt of the earth. Voters love that.

07:57.115 --> 07:58.883
Turn that frown upside down, Skippy.

07:59.035 --> 08:02.742
All right? Unhappy family members
reflect badly at the polls.

08:06.255 --> 08:09.325
I'm looking forward to this campaign
being over.

08:11.545 --> 08:14.201
This isn't about numbers,
demographics or projections.

08:14.345 --> 08:17.628
It's about giving everybody the chance
to live a life with dignity.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.371
Whether they have a dollar in the bank,
or a million.

08:20.515 --> 08:24.858
That's why I got involved in the senate
race and that's why I intend to win.

08:24.975 --> 08:29.954
Regardless of my opponent's checkbook,
I don't care how big it is.

08:30.065 --> 08:32.044
Listen, if you need
any more comment...

08:32.155 --> 08:34.428
call my campaign manager,
Lois Lane.

08:34.525 --> 08:36.888
She'll talk to you, all right? Thanks.

08:37.034 --> 08:39.600
You're getting very smooth
with the interviews.

08:39.705 --> 08:43.705
I've had a lot of practice. I feel like
I got a phone growing out of my ear.

08:43.784 --> 08:47.542
Well, you're doing great.
Homestretch, senator.

08:47.665 --> 08:50.150
I'm not the senator,
I haven't won anything yet.

08:50.295 --> 08:53.709
Well, you will when I'm done.
Here we are. This is what we're doing.

08:53.845 --> 08:56.835
Print ads in all the papers,
radio spots across the dial...

08:56.965 --> 08:59.833
billboards littering the interstate
like roadkill...

08:59.975 --> 09:03.803
and the nail that is going to
close the coffin...

09:03.935 --> 09:06.288
"...on" our bald-headed wannabe's
campaign...

09:06.435 --> 09:07.829
the heartland message...

09:07.935 --> 09:12.238
on every TV station across Kansas
from now until Election Day.

09:12.355 --> 09:15.102
Well, it sounds like somebody I know
needs a raise.

09:15.235 --> 09:18.396
Technically,
you'd have to start paying me first.

09:19.495 --> 09:24.293
Lois, this is all really fantastic,
but how can we afford it?

09:26.085 --> 09:28.610
You know what,
don't even bother with the details.

09:28.755 --> 09:31.573
You just need to shake hands
and kiss babies, all right?

09:31.715 --> 09:34.957
Let's talk about your schedule
from now till Election Day.

09:35.885 --> 09:39.168
- You're gonna be one busy guy.
- Yeah.

09:50.525 --> 09:55.242
I know how he feels about Lex,
but what am I supposed to do, Chloe?

09:55.365 --> 09:58.264
It's like there's this part of Clark
that just shuts down...

09:58.405 --> 10:01.526
anytime I start talking about
the meteors or what I saw.

10:03.075 --> 10:06.236
Okay, let me just call you back
in a second, all right?

10:20.015 --> 10:23.298
I'm sorry, officer,
I know I was driving a little bit fast.

10:23.385 --> 10:26.294
That's the least of your problems,
Miss Lang.

10:32.645 --> 10:34.665
<i>What are you doing?</i>

10:34.775 --> 10:36.633
<i>Shut your mouth.</i>

10:37.235 --> 10:38.629
Lana?

10:38.775 --> 10:40.462
- Let her go.
- "Lex?"

10:40.615 --> 10:42.009
I said, let her go.

10:42.155 --> 10:45.104
<i>Remember that stalemate
you were talking about, Luthor?</i>

10:46.245 --> 10:50.416
- Lex, why are they doing this?
- Yeah, Lex, why all the fuss?

10:50.545 --> 10:53.828
Lana, they're looking for a spaceship.

10:54.865 --> 10:57.683
- What spaceship?
- Is everybody stupid around here?

10:57.785 --> 10:59.967
Tell us where it is
and all this is over.

11:00.115 --> 11:01.933
She doesn't know anything.

11:02.075 --> 11:04.438
Yeah, well, she was there
when it crashed.

11:04.575 --> 11:07.989
And I know you two have been
spending an awful lot of time together.

11:08.125 --> 11:12.801
So get your ass out here now
or you'll be talking to yourself.

11:19.305 --> 11:23.093
I guess you're not as important
after all.

11:30.985 --> 11:32.753
Step out.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.761
Check him.

11:45.245 --> 11:49.376
Don't worry, Lana.
I'm not gonna let this psycho hurt you.

11:49.495 --> 11:51.273
You think you can stop me, Luthor?

12:06.265 --> 12:08.709
- You all right? You hurt?
- No, I'm okay.

12:08.855 --> 12:11.592
I warned you knowing about that ship
could be dangerous.

12:11.685 --> 12:13.291
Lex.

12:14.485 --> 12:18.020
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Lex.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.055
Oh, my God.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.068
Come on, Bob,
you can do better than this.

12:36.215 --> 12:39.164
I know it's 30 seconds
smack in the middle of prime time...

12:39.295 --> 12:41.153
that's why it's called "prime."

12:41.305 --> 12:44.921
Drop 10 grand and I promise you,
I will get you a personal invitation...

12:45.055 --> 12:47.580
"...to" Senator Kent's election party.

12:48.595 --> 12:51.463
I'll save you a dance. Thanks, Bob.

12:53.935 --> 12:58.026
Wow, prime time.
That must have cost a bit, huh?

12:58.235 --> 13:00.851
Feminine wiles.
Bob's got a crush on me.

13:00.985 --> 13:03.510
Parts of me.
He let me have it for next to nothing.

13:03.655 --> 13:06.018
I wonder if all you nice people
wouldn't mind...

13:06.115 --> 13:08.054
giving Miss Lane and I
a few minutes?

13:08.165 --> 13:11.195
Why don't you get yourself
a cup of coffee.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.512
Thank you.

13:18.835 --> 13:21.916
Wow, "Miss Lane."
I'm feeling all professional.

13:22.345 --> 13:24.830
You've really grown into your role
well here, Lois.

13:24.965 --> 13:28.086
Like the way you managed
to get all this last-minute publicity.

13:28.185 --> 13:29.569
That's very impressive.

13:30.645 --> 13:32.069
Thanks, boss.

13:33.315 --> 13:35.335
It also must be very expensive.

13:36.275 --> 13:39.012
I told you not to bother with that,
I've got it covered.

13:39.145 --> 13:41.428
Yeah, you see, that's my problem.

13:41.565 --> 13:44.817
I'm crunching the numbers,
they don't seem to add up, Lois.

13:44.905 --> 13:47.056
We're spending more than we have.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.636
A lot more.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.607
- Well, I just called in a few favors.
- Lois.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.610
I appreciate everything you're doing,
I really do.

13:57.755 --> 14:00.745
But you've got to stop
sidestepping my question.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.481
Where's the money coming from?

14:06.925 --> 14:08.359
Lionel Luthor.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.279
I didn't have a choice.

14:15.395 --> 14:17.799
The well ran dry,
and without Lionel's backing...

14:17.895 --> 14:20.258
our campaign would have folded
weeks ago.

14:20.395 --> 14:21.920
It was the right thing to do.

14:22.025 --> 14:24.388
We actually have a chance
to win this thing now.

14:24.525 --> 14:27.181
What is the point
if the devil owns your soul?

14:27.285 --> 14:28.760
It's not like that.

14:28.865 --> 14:31.643
He doesn't want anything from you.
This is about Lex.

14:31.785 --> 14:35.068
Lionel's gonna do anything he can
to stop Lex from becoming senator.

14:35.205 --> 14:38.488
I'm sure that that's true.
But you don't know Lionel like I do.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.867
He doesn't give anyone
anything for free. There's always a price.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.235
I'm the one that's
gonna have to pay it.

15:00.685 --> 15:02.584
Clark...

15:03.025 --> 15:06.308
can you put on the brakes
before you tornado my homework?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.173
I'm sorry.

15:10.035 --> 15:14.833
All right, Dostoyevsky's "Idiot" isn't
gonna get any smarter, so come on...

15:15.075 --> 15:18.156
"...Miss" Sullivan's advice column
is open for letters.

15:18.295 --> 15:20.982
Lana and I had another fight.

15:21.125 --> 15:24.155
I know, she called me
right after the big blowout.

15:24.795 --> 15:26.189
What did she say?

15:26.345 --> 15:30.638
Just the headlines: Spaceship, boyfriend
that always changes the subject...

15:30.765 --> 15:33.159
forced to turn to
everyone's favorite villain.

15:33.305 --> 15:35.163
How long has she been
working on this?

15:35.305 --> 15:38.891
I don't know, actually.
This is the first I've ever heard of it.

15:39.645 --> 15:42.675
You have to find out
how long they've been working together.

15:42.815 --> 15:44.583
Are you asking me to spy on Lana?

15:45.065 --> 15:48.014
- It's very important.
- I understand, and you're my friend...

15:48.115 --> 15:51.822
but so is Lana, and there is no way
I'm getting in the middle of this.

16:03.215 --> 16:04.892
Is that Lana?

16:05.715 --> 16:09.795
Hello? Yes, this is Chloe Sullivan.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.652
Where?

16:12.055 --> 16:16.186
No. No, she hasn't been back
to the dorm at all.

16:16.435 --> 16:19.213
Yeah, I will, I will. Thank you.

16:19.565 --> 16:21.242
What happened?

16:21.645 --> 16:24.513
That was the Smallville
Sheriff's Department.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.669
Something wrong?

16:26.815 --> 16:30.401
They found Lana's car
abandoned on the side of the road.

16:38.575 --> 16:42.161
Start a perimeter search. See if you
can find anything out in that field.

16:42.295 --> 16:44.063
Sheriff?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.818
Mr. Kent, what did you do,
drop out of the sky?

16:46.965 --> 16:49.662
- Where's Lana?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

16:49.795 --> 16:53.340
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Couple of hours ago.

16:53.425 --> 16:56.374
- We had a fight.
- Well, that's what people in love do...

16:56.475 --> 16:57.859
then they make up...

16:58.015 --> 17:00.883
which I aim to give you
and Miss Lang the chance to do.

17:01.015 --> 17:04.771
We found her purse, everything's in it.
And the car speaks for itself.

17:04.895 --> 17:08.481
I'd peg this as a kidnapping
but there's no sign of a struggle...

17:08.605 --> 17:13.029
which suggests she either knew
her assailant or was caught off-guard.

17:13.944 --> 17:16.521
Either way, we'll go over
every inch of the scene...

17:16.615 --> 17:18.938
until we dust off
something useful...

17:19.704 --> 17:21.089
Sheriff.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.736
It's a GPS.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.861
Someone must have been
following her.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.955
How in the Sam Spade
did you know where to find this?

17:34.465 --> 17:36.697
- Just a hunch.
- You got an awful lot of those.

17:36.845 --> 17:40.178
I've said it before, but I could use
a man like you on the force...

17:40.305 --> 17:42.163
instead of some of these hayseeds.

17:42.305 --> 17:47.870
There's a serial number on here,
"511 GKL97."

17:47.985 --> 17:49.540
So I think maybe...

17:50.775 --> 17:52.330
Sheriff.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.220
We got a silent alarm
from up at the Luthor mansion.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.648
- Harris is checking it out.
- Harris, what's your situation?

17:58.785 --> 18:00.977
All clear, sheriff.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.304
Looks like it was a false alarm.

18:04.795 --> 18:06.522
Okay, keep searching the perimeter.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.736
You get anything,
you get me on the horn.

18:20.635 --> 18:22.786
<i>Getting a little warm in there?</i>

18:22.935 --> 18:25.591
<i>I hacked into the climate controls.</i>

18:25.725 --> 18:28.886
<i>Should hit about a buck thirty
in half an hour.</i>

18:29.025 --> 18:32.186
<i>Give me a yell
when you're medium rare.</i>

18:32.565 --> 18:37.241
<i>By the way, how's that bullet feel?
I know I got you.</i>

18:37.365 --> 18:40.102
- I can't stop it.
- It's okay.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.841
They'll be here soon.

18:41.995 --> 18:45.409
- Who?
- The police.

18:46.795 --> 18:49.027
Barney Fife out there
was using a scrambler...

18:49.125 --> 18:51.701
to block the wireless backup alarm.

18:51.835 --> 18:54.027
That's what you were shooting at.

18:54.795 --> 18:58.421
If we were at the fair,
I would have won you a stuffed giraffe.

18:58.555 --> 19:02.555
I would've liked that a lot more than
you getting shot trying to protect me.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.346
I was just trying to get us
back into the panic room.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.009
I know what you did, Lex.

19:11.565 --> 19:13.171
Thank you.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.840
Lana...

19:21.995 --> 19:25.278
"...I'm" sorry
that you got sucked into this.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.021
Why didn't you just tell them
where the spaceship was?

19:28.125 --> 19:29.973
This isn't worth your life.

19:30.915 --> 19:33.531
I can't tell them the truth...

19:34.885 --> 19:37.875
because they'd kill both of us.

19:38.505 --> 19:40.323
<i>Mr. Luthor?</i>

19:47.105 --> 19:49.751
I don't think they'll get the chance.

19:56.365 --> 20:00.617
- Sheriff, what are you doing here?
- Out for a stroll. What do you think?

20:01.115 --> 20:03.175
I already told you
it was a false alarm.

20:03.325 --> 20:06.567
Coming from the mansion of a billionaire
running for state senate?

20:06.665 --> 20:10.493
Luthor manages to get himself elected,
I don't want him chewing my backside...

20:10.585 --> 20:13.363
for not showing up to hold his hand.
Now, where is he?

20:13.505 --> 20:16.202
- Out, I guess. I haven't...
- Out?

20:16.335 --> 20:20.254
You don't stand down an alarm without
talking to the primary resident, Harris.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.829
Now get your head in the game.

20:23.925 --> 20:26.036
Sheriff.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.081
Flynn?

20:58.465 --> 21:00.869
Well, ain't that a mother.

21:26.615 --> 21:28.554
Why is this taking so long?

21:28.665 --> 21:32.786
Well, getting past the server's firewall
and the encryption protocol takes time.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.541
Sorry, Clark, but I don't have
a super-speed mode. Get out of here.

21:39.085 --> 21:41.529
But I am the slickest blond
you'll ever meet.

21:41.635 --> 21:46.513
Okay, so it looks like the serial number
for the GPS you found...

21:46.595 --> 21:49.373
matches a unit sold
to a Gregory Flynn.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.859
What do you got on him?

21:50.975 --> 21:53.672
In a couple of seconds, everything.

21:57.435 --> 21:59.586
Clark, Lana's gonna be okay.

22:02.985 --> 22:05.348
She has you, doesn't she?

22:09.825 --> 22:13.703
Oh, here we go. "Flynn, Gregory R."

22:15.085 --> 22:16.893
He's a Smallville sheriff's officer.

22:17.165 --> 22:19.609
Yeah, up until a couple of months ago.

22:19.715 --> 22:22.998
He was put on psychiatric leave
because he was wounded...

22:23.085 --> 22:27.347
and his entire unit was killed during
the meteor shower.

22:28.345 --> 22:30.325
He was there when
the spaceship landed.

22:30.475 --> 22:35.444
- When those Kryptonians killed everyone.
- Yeah, but Flynn survived the attack.

22:35.565 --> 22:37.625
God, seeing something like that.
I mean...

22:37.725 --> 22:40.088
all those people you work with,
your friends.

22:40.185 --> 22:42.629
No wonder he had a psychotic break.
Let's go.

22:42.735 --> 22:45.896
- Why would he kidnap Lana?
- I don't know, but she was there too.

22:45.985 --> 22:48.561
I thought maybe if we can get
his psych workup...

22:48.705 --> 22:51.105
we can figure out
what it is that he's up to.

22:51.107 --> 22:52.925
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:54.815 --> 22:58.017
I can't believe Lois would take money
from Lionel behind my back.

22:58.105 --> 23:01.731
- She has no idea what he's capable of.
- It wasn't her fault.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.886
Martha, please.
Don't defend her to me.

23:03.985 --> 23:06.268
I'm not.

23:06.865 --> 23:09.946
I took the money from Lionel.

23:14.955 --> 23:16.470
How could you do that?

23:16.625 --> 23:19.998
Because I know how much
this means to you, Jonathan.

23:20.085 --> 23:22.873
To be able to make
a real difference in the world...

23:22.965 --> 23:25.914
the way our son does everyday.

23:27.595 --> 23:28.989
I love you so much.

23:29.095 --> 23:32.216
I don't want you to lose
because Lex has a bigger bank account.

23:32.305 --> 23:36.688
I promised the only people I would owe
were the people who voted for me.

23:36.775 --> 23:40.350
Now that I've taken it, I'm no different
than any other lying politician.

23:40.445 --> 23:43.768
You think the Farmers Association
and the Rotary Club...

23:43.865 --> 23:47.824
and everyone else who gave
you money won't be asking for favors?

23:47.905 --> 23:49.763
They can ask anything that they want.

23:49.865 --> 23:52.602
But I won't do something
I don't believe in.

23:52.915 --> 23:56.076
Then why should it be
any different with Lionel?

23:56.705 --> 23:58.685
Martha, you know it's not the same.

23:58.795 --> 24:02.249
I know nothing is black or white,
especially in politics.

24:02.335 --> 24:04.365
If you win this election...

24:04.465 --> 24:08.556
you'll be able to help so many people
who desperately need it.

24:08.635 --> 24:12.130
Please, don't let your pride
get in the way.

24:18.725 --> 24:21.422
<i>How many more people
have to die for this?</i>

24:21.440 --> 24:24.470
<i>As many as it takes.
Luthor can 't last much longer in there.</i>

24:24.570 --> 24:27.126
<i>He'll bleed out
if he doesn 't open that door.</i>

24:27.135 --> 24:31.013
Lex. Hey, hey, come on. Wake up.

24:31.955 --> 24:33.591
You're in shock.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.906
Stay conscious or else
you might die. Okay?

24:36.015 --> 24:37.863
All right.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.086
Okay, well, tell me something.

24:42.185 --> 24:46.356
- What?
- Anything. Just keep talking, okay?

24:48.235 --> 24:51.103
You think I'd look better with hair?

24:57.785 --> 25:00.148
I don't know.
I've never thought about it.

25:00.285 --> 25:05.426
Oh, I have.
I've thought about a lot of things.

25:08.885 --> 25:11.067
Clark has really nice hair.

25:12.045 --> 25:15.297
Yeah. Yeah, I guess he does.

25:16.555 --> 25:19.878
- Does he know?
- That he has nice hair?

25:24.185 --> 25:26.629
How lucky he is.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.813
I had a dream once, Lana.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.150
About how different things could be.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.820
It was Christmas.

25:47.545 --> 25:50.323
Clark and I were friends again.

25:51.255 --> 25:53.780
Well, that sounds really nice.

25:53.810 --> 25:55.497
You were in my dream too.

25:56.190 --> 25:58.119
I was?

26:01.480 --> 26:04.975
You were the best part about it.

26:06.610 --> 26:09.266
Lex. Lex, we have
to get you out of here, all right?

26:09.370 --> 26:11.804
Just give them what they want.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.806
I can't tell them where it is.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.110
This spaceship isn't gonna make
any difference if you're dead.

26:17.250 --> 26:21.795
I can't tell them where it is
because I honestly don't know.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.144
What?

26:26.260 --> 26:29.583
One minute it was there
and the next...

26:29.680 --> 26:33.215
Nothing but static on the security
cameras and an empty warehouse.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.239
I'm sorry.

26:35.350 --> 26:36.784
How long have you known this?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.671
A few weeks.

26:39.850 --> 26:45.122
Lex, how could you have lied
to me this entire time?

26:45.190 --> 26:48.685
Because I didn't know
how to tell you the truth, Lana.

26:48.780 --> 26:51.436
Your life, mine.

26:52.240 --> 26:55.533
They've both been affected
so much by these meteors.

26:59.210 --> 27:02.917
That ship was our one chance
to understand why.

27:04.210 --> 27:08.422
I was hoping
that I might find it again before...

27:12.010 --> 27:14.586
I should have been honest with you.

27:15.430 --> 27:16.824
Lex?

27:20.270 --> 27:23.593
Lex. Lex. Oh, God.

27:23.690 --> 27:28.286
Lex, Lex, please don't... Stay awake.
Lex, please. Please, wake up.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.683
Oh, God.

27:37.370 --> 27:41.461
I'll tell you where the ship is. But first
you have to get Lex help. He's hurt.

27:47.380 --> 27:48.855
I've seen worse.

27:48.970 --> 27:52.000
Call for help, and I'll tell you where it is.
That's the deal.

27:52.090 --> 27:55.544
Well, I'm making a new deal. Take me
to the ship. Then I make the call.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.660
Lana, don't.

27:58.430 --> 28:00.157
All right.

28:22.170 --> 28:25.160
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
You're gonna wait here.

28:25.260 --> 28:29.138
I'll double back and see if I can hack
into the visitors list to get us passes.

28:29.220 --> 28:33.725
Then we can come back in and maybe
get right by that guy right there.

28:33.850 --> 28:35.496
I got it.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.171
What did you do?

28:43.150 --> 28:45.261
Super shake.

28:50.490 --> 28:53.823
Not bad. Not bad.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.129
<i>- I am not crazy.
- No one's saying that.</i>

29:10.220 --> 29:12.078
<i>Then why won 't you believe me?</i>

29:12.180 --> 29:14.836
<i>I saw a ship crash
in the meteor shower.</i>

29:14.930 --> 29:17.546
<i>I saw what came out of it.</i>

29:17.640 --> 29:20.044
<i>- Gregory...
- They hit us with some heat beams...</i>

29:20.150 --> 29:26.382
<i>from their eyes.
Took out the cars and the helicopter.</i>

29:26.860 --> 29:28.506
<i>I was pinned.</i>

29:28.610 --> 29:31.398
<i>I could smell something burning.</i>

29:31.490 --> 29:33.722
<i>It was me.</i>

29:33.830 --> 29:36.355
<i>I was burning.</i>

29:37.790 --> 29:40.992
<i>I didn't scream, didn 't make a sound
because they would've seen me.</i>

29:41.130 --> 29:44.746
<i>- Who?
- Those things from the ship.</i>

29:44.840 --> 29:46.395
<i>They killed everyone.</i>

29:46.510 --> 29:48.863
<i>Everyone except the girl.
She got away.</i>

29:49.010 --> 29:50.697
<i>- We've been over this.</i>
- Lana.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.456
<i>There is no ship.
Your team was hit by a meteor.</i>

29:53.560 --> 29:55.792
<i>That's what he wants you to believe!</i>

29:55.930 --> 29:59.808
<i>I saw him take the ship!</i>

29:59.900 --> 30:02.970
<i>I am not crazy!</i>

30:03.060 --> 30:06.938
<i>Ask Lex Luthor!
He knows the truth! He has the ship!</i>

30:07.070 --> 30:08.716
Lex.

30:08.990 --> 30:11.384
Clark, that's where they must be.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.976
Damn, I wish I could do that.

30:19.410 --> 30:21.188
Sheriff?

30:34.550 --> 30:36.368
Lex.

30:37.890 --> 30:39.577
Lex?

30:49.490 --> 30:51.934
We're here.
Make the call and get Lex help.

30:52.030 --> 30:53.424
After I see the ship.

30:53.530 --> 30:56.863
What are you gonna do? Climb inside
and fly away? There's no way in.

30:56.950 --> 30:59.647
Oh, we don't plan to.

30:59.750 --> 31:02.487
You don't want to take the ship.
You want to destroy it.

31:02.580 --> 31:04.348
That thing crashed from outer space.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.611
Couple of pounds
of C-4 wouldn't dent it.

31:06.710 --> 31:09.195
But it will make an awful lot of noise.

31:09.300 --> 31:12.754
Police, fire, news crews,
they'll all come running.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.446
And they'll see it.

31:14.550 --> 31:18.721
Just like us. Only difference is,
you kept quiet and I told the truth.

31:18.810 --> 31:21.335
And they sent him
to a psych ward for it.

31:21.430 --> 31:24.430
And they wouldn't even let me see him,
his own fiancée.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.964
People need to be warned
before more of them land.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.797
It's the right thing to do.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.839
Tell Sheriff Adams that.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.405
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.409
It was here before. I swear it was.

31:54.090 --> 31:56.494
Don't lie to me.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.525
Lex. Lex! Where's Lana?

32:27.670 --> 32:29.902
- Get him out of here!
- Tell me where she is.

32:30.130 --> 32:32.281
Warehouse 15.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.881
- Greg.
- Get the case.

32:42.970 --> 32:44.495
We gotta get the case.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.468
- The what?
- The case!

32:49.810 --> 32:52.931
Greg. Greg...

32:53.030 --> 32:55.010
- I got it.
- No, we gotta get out of here.

32:55.110 --> 32:59.362
- I got it.
- Greg. We have to get out of here!

33:00.620 --> 33:02.216
Come on!

33:38.740 --> 33:42.447
- Lana.
- Clark?

33:43.580 --> 33:44.964
What happened?

33:46.620 --> 33:48.983
I don't know.
Lex told me where to find you.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.029
When I got here,
you were laying on the ground.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.231
I don't understand.

33:55.380 --> 33:58.713
You're alive. That's all that matters.

34:05.470 --> 34:08.206
She knows where the spaceship is.
Don't let her lie!

34:08.310 --> 34:11.552
She's working with Luthor!
She knows everything!

34:18.570 --> 34:20.630
What a nut.

34:23.530 --> 34:25.388
How you doing?

34:25.489 --> 34:29.581
Doing all right,
considering I almost got blown up.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.563
I can't believe Lex would risk your life.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.326
- Clark...
- He knew there was no ship in there.

34:35.460 --> 34:38.581
Clark, it wasn't his idea.
I brought them here on my own.

34:38.969 --> 34:42.424
- You did?
- It was my only chance to get Lex help.

34:44.139 --> 34:45.655
You risked your life for Lex?

34:45.810 --> 34:49.172
He did the same thing for me
back at the mansion.

34:49.270 --> 34:52.844
Clark, if it wasn't for him,
I'd probably be dead.

34:53.690 --> 34:56.134
Lex saved my life.

35:01.780 --> 35:06.094
<i>A good neighbor, a man who knows
the value of an honest day's work...</i>

35:06.480 --> 35:09.096
<i>and the responsibility of family.</i>

35:09.200 --> 35:11.765
<i>- Jonathan Kent...</i>
- What did you think?

35:11.860 --> 35:15.224
I think the flag might have
been a bit much, don't you?

35:15.225 --> 35:17.881
Nothing says America
like the Stars and Stripes.

35:18.370 --> 35:21.703
Except maybe the name
Jonathan Kent.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.490
I'm sorry I accepted Lionel's contribution
without asking you first.

35:27.505 --> 35:30.202
- It was wrong. I shouldn't have done it.
- Lois. Lois.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.714
He knows.

35:31.770 --> 35:34.083
- He does?
- Yeah.

35:34.190 --> 35:37.644
I know. Martha told me that
she's the one that accepted the money.

35:37.730 --> 35:40.598
It's a fact you might've shared
when I was yelling at you.

35:41.070 --> 35:44.231
Well, the decision to use it
was still mine.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.986
Look, I think you are going to be
a great senator, Mr. Kent.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.827
But the hard truth is you wouldn't have
a chance without Lionel's money.

35:52.210 --> 35:55.240
No, Lois. The hard truth is...

35:55.330 --> 35:59.380
"...by" taking it, I'm no longer the man
that you just saw on television.

35:59.460 --> 36:02.116
And I'm no longer the man
you married.

36:03.630 --> 36:07.256
That's why I've decided to pay back
Lionel Luthor every cent he loaned us.

36:07.390 --> 36:11.642
How? Not having any green
is what put us in this hole.

36:16.230 --> 36:17.917
I sold the back 40 this morning.

36:18.060 --> 36:21.312
Jonathan, that land has been
in your family for generations.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.268
Yeah, and I've never done
a thing with it, sweetheart.

36:25.280 --> 36:29.744
I should have sold it years ago.
I was just too proud. I'm sorry.

36:33.580 --> 36:37.246
I know it's not the whole thing,
but it's certainly a start. Here you go.

36:39.090 --> 36:41.272
Well, I'll do everything I can
to help you.

36:41.420 --> 36:44.329
I never doubted that, sweetie.

36:46.930 --> 36:48.617
So, what happens in the meantime?

36:48.720 --> 36:51.498
If you're right,
Lionel will want something from you.

36:51.600 --> 36:55.478
I'll find out soon enough. But right now,
we have an election to win.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.500
Absolutely.

37:14.620 --> 37:17.064
That doesn't look like bed rest.

37:18.460 --> 37:23.641
Yeah. I was never really good
at taking things lying down.

37:23.710 --> 37:27.124
Well, you are a Luthor.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.446
Yeah.

37:30.140 --> 37:32.372
I guess I am.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.867
Lana...

37:36.770 --> 37:40.224
"...I'm" sorry I didn't tell you
about losing the ship.

37:41.310 --> 37:44.138
Wouldn't matter. It'd still be gone.

37:44.230 --> 37:46.634
Yeah, well, at least
you wouldn't hate me for it.

37:51.120 --> 37:54.271
I don't hate you, Lex.

37:55.330 --> 37:58.956
How could I after you risked your life
to save mine?

38:01.080 --> 38:04.161
You're one of the few
good things in my life.

38:05.590 --> 38:07.529
I hope that won't change.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.124
Well, that depends on you.

38:13.300 --> 38:16.966
All I ever asked for was the truth.

38:17.100 --> 38:20.686
And that's all you'll ever get
from me from now on.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.672
I promise.

38:25.020 --> 38:27.888
Lana, we may not have the ship...

38:27.990 --> 38:31.444
"...but" that doesn't mean
we can't keep trying to find it.

38:31.530 --> 38:34.691
And solve all the mysteries
that go with it.

38:39.870 --> 38:41.304
Partners?

38:45.040 --> 38:46.646
No.

38:52.970 --> 38:55.788
Let's try being friends.

39:23.540 --> 39:27.590
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.307
The only reason Lana almost got killed
was because of Lex.

39:39.390 --> 39:41.289
Lana can make her own decisions.

39:41.390 --> 39:43.713
I'm not saying she can't,
but we all know Lex.

39:43.810 --> 39:46.719
He twists everything
until you don't know what to believe.

39:46.810 --> 39:49.638
Oh, no, Lex is a snake.
Believe me, I've seen his scales.

39:49.730 --> 39:52.639
But he did almost die taking
a bullet for Lana.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.972
- I saved her. Does that mean anything?
- Yeah.

39:55.070 --> 39:57.353
You know what?
It would, if she knew about it.

39:57.450 --> 39:59.935
The only reason Lana started
talking to Lex...

40:00.040 --> 40:02.484
was to learn more
about that spaceship.

40:02.580 --> 40:04.731
If I was honest,
she never would've had to.

40:04.830 --> 40:06.769
No, she wouldn't.

40:11.340 --> 40:13.825
I love her so much, Chloe.

40:17.720 --> 40:19.619
I know.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.548
But all you're doing now
is pushing her further away.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.872
That's not what I want.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.925
I want us to be together
for the rest of our lives.

40:31.820 --> 40:36.244
The only way that's ever gonna happen
is if you tell her the truth.
