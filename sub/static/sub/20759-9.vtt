Because of the beard and the shoulders?
I get it.

I don't know what emojis say

00:26.276 --> 00:27.152
Hmm.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.780
But also, I don't know anything
about real religion.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.281
What does it even mean
that he wants to be a normal reverend?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.617
You're asking the wrong Cumberbitch.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.536
I haven't been to church

Noice! What's Good Friday?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.765
It's the day Jesus got nailed
to a cross to slowly suffocate.

And also, they stabbed him and made him
drink vinegar and laughed at him.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.395
How is that good?

sound like an accident.

Yes. Lending my obscene talents

Next time, get a husband

10:19.536 --> 10:22.205
who's simply having
an emotional affair with his sister.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.791
[laughs] They can't get married.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.252
[both laughing exaggeratedly]

10:29.671 --> 10:31.089
Oh! Till tomorrow, then.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.258
I, for one, hope we both live to see it.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.717
[giggles]

10:34.801 --> 10:36.344
Okay.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.554
-New to town?
-Not as such.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.013
-Just coming to church now?
-This church.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.224
-Where are your people from?
-Didn't all life start in Africa?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.767
-Sweet tea or lemonade?
-Sweet tea.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.310
-Popeyes or Church's?
-Please. Waffle House.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.895
-You got a girlfriend?
-No one as good as my mama.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.063
-Diabetes?
-Not yet.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.648
-What do you do for a living?
-Renaissance man.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.775
-How many fingers am I holding up?
-Three, Miss Clara.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.945
You have a blessed day, Titus.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.114
You too, ma'am.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.411
[gasping]

11:04.330 --> 11:05.415
[door opens]

11:06.875 --> 11:08.918
Clara is trying to destroy me.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.420
No, she's not, Titus.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.589
She overheard me bad-mouthing the choir.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.382
How can I prove I'm a good person

11:14.465 --> 11:17.135
if she gets me kicked out of the
congregation before I get the chance?

11:17.218 --> 11:19.053
Uh-huh. And why would she do that?

11:19.137 --> 11:21.472
'Cause she's a person, Kimmy,
a play on "Jimmy."

11:21.556 --> 11:23.349
That's what persons do.

11:23.433 --> 11:27.020
They gossip and put other people down
so they can feel superior.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.439
Not if they follow the Bible.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.941
As Jesus said, "Won't you be my neighbor?"

11:32.025 --> 11:33.318
No.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.904
They use this as an excuse
to be as shady as they want to be.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.489
So when they call someone out
for skimping on the collection,

11:38.573 --> 11:40.283
they're not hypocrites because...

11:41.284 --> 11:44.412
"Zipporah took a flint knife,
cut off her son's foreskin,

11:44.495 --> 11:47.457
-and touched Moses' feet with it"?
-What?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.250
The old ladies are better
at finding the quotes.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.585
Titus, that doesn't--

11:50.668 --> 11:53.046
Because that 12-year-old boy
who got kicked out of the choir...

11:53.129 --> 11:54.505
was me!

11:56.007 --> 11:57.842
Yeah. You said that.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.385
That was the whole story.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.554
And it was your fault
for getting kicked out.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.015
But what came after was all Bernice.

12:04.098 --> 12:08.144
Back at Ray's Original Baptist Church
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi,

12:08.227 --> 12:09.646
our Clara was named Bernice.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.316
And when I committed the sin
of pridefulness and vanity...

12:13.399 --> 12:15.985
<i>♪ I am keeping this robe ♪</i>

12:16.069 --> 12:17.987
[Titus] <i>...I flew right into her web.</i>

12:18.071 --> 12:19.530
Bernice had hated us Wilkersons

12:19.614 --> 12:21.783
ever since we got the pew
closest to the air-conditioning.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.620
So she used my sin to get us moved
all the way to the back.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.414
One of my aunts, Ernestine, melted, Kimmy.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.332
[Kimmy] Ugh.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.417
Titus, don't ruin this for me.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.669
These are good people.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.255
After meeting me, they all said
they'd pray for me.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.676
And this afternoon, Miss Clara and I
are helping clothe the poor.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.427
Isn't that what Old Navy's for?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.262
Ain't no way Morgan Fairchild
is shopping there.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.556
You just watch, K-Stew.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.768
That woman's a user, a gossip,
and a snake in the grass.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.354
I wish this neighborhood
had enough grass to support snakes.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.690
Maybe they'd eat the spiders
that are eating all the birds.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.653
[door opens and slams]

13:01.781 --> 13:03.116
All right!

13:03.199 --> 13:05.910
Next step: table manners.

13:05.994 --> 13:09.205
That is a table.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.958
Forget it, Blondie. I am outta here.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.044
Everything hurts in this monkey suit.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.297
I hope so; those shoes are genuine
white-faced capuchin.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.175
Let me ask you a question.
Who is all this for?

13:21.259 --> 13:23.928
Is it to impress that Deirdre lady?

13:24.012 --> 13:26.806
'Cause that woman is like
Domino's pizza...

13:26.889 --> 13:28.683
hot but terrible.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.268
Exactly.

13:30.351 --> 13:34.230
And I have to see her
and all the others like her every day.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.566
At school pickups, Easter egg hunts,

13:36.649 --> 13:38.192
and blimp christenings.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.195
So excuse me if I care what I look like.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.990
Well, I don't give a rip for outer beauty

13:44.073 --> 13:45.366
or inner beauty.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.577
It's disgusting in there.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.705
Blood, chewed-up food, the whole thing.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.915
[sighs]

13:54.292 --> 13:55.126
Oh.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.170
[air whooshes]

14:00.715 --> 14:02.508
Thanks, but no, thanks.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.926
[sighs]

14:06.679 --> 14:09.307
[Clara] Thank you. Thank you.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.979
Guess some people don't know gluttony
is one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.232
I heard he had the Al Roker procedure,

14:18.316 --> 14:21.027
but it just fwoomped right back.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.405
Oh. Who are we to judge, right?

14:24.489 --> 14:26.657
Oh, I'm concerned for him.

14:26.741 --> 14:29.911
The Bible says the heart
is the wellspring of life.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.789
And his idea of exercise
is getting the mail.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.415
Mostly catalogs.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.710
He doesn't have any friends
and can't afford anything in there.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.796
I'm just worried.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.381
[Kimmy clears throat]

14:41.464 --> 14:44.592
You know, last night, after we sang
the theme song to <i>Sister Act,</i>

14:44.675 --> 14:45.760
Pastor Denise talked about--

14:45.843 --> 14:48.304
And I'm still getting used to her.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.224
Thinks she can come down here from Boston

14:51.307 --> 14:55.395
and tell me my grandson
can't use the Mimeo machine?

14:55.478 --> 14:57.563
He got a mixtape to get out there.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.690
Call me old-fashioned if you want to,

14:59.774 --> 15:02.860
but I don't care for a female pastor.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.948
Um, women can do anything.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.243
A woman crashed her car
into the mayor's house this morning.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.954
Oh, honey, it is not my idea.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.624
Saint Paul said women
should be silent in church.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.959
It's in the Book.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.094
Oh... Reuben!

15:28.177 --> 15:30.263
[whispering] I want to tell you
some things I found out

15:30.346 --> 15:31.764
about that new person.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.433
I have an arrangement to finish.
Can this wait?

15:33.516 --> 15:35.351
I just think you need to know some things

15:35.435 --> 15:37.478
about your new high-ass tenor, Titus.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.565
But okay, I'll find you
after service tomorrow.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.111
She <i>is</i> a snake in the grass!

15:45.194 --> 15:46.737
Which is better than somewhere else.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.657
Like a toilet or your mouth. But still!

15:50.408 --> 15:51.409
[smack]

15:53.161 --> 15:56.372
The boy has no father. It's a sad story.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.666
But spare the rod and spoil the child.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.170
Oh, look at the time.

16:02.253 --> 16:05.673
Honey, you be Ruth and shoulder my burden.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.892
Titus, you were right about Miss Clara.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.685
She is not a good person.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.187
She acts all holier-than-thou,

17:01.270 --> 17:03.397
but she has the same number
of holes as anyone else.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.233
Well, I hate to say I told you so,

17:05.316 --> 17:06.943
because I prefer the less formal "toldja."

17:07.026 --> 17:07.859
Toldja!

17:07.944 --> 17:09.945
She used the Bible to manipulate me.

17:10.029 --> 17:10.863
Just like--

17:12.031 --> 17:14.867
Gosh dang it!
I mean, is that what all religion is?

17:14.951 --> 17:17.244
Basically. That and cut-up doughnuts.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.789
Don't they know I can reassemble
those doughnuts?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.290
Uh-huh. Well, Clara's
gonna talk to Reuben tomorrow.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.291
About you.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.297
Like how Jesus knew Judas
would betray him in the morning.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.384
Well, unlike Jesus,
I'm not just gonna give up.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.927
I'm a good person, Kimmy.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.429
I can't let Clara ruin everything.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.557
-We've gotta stop her!
-But how?

17:37.640 --> 17:40.268
The only thing that stopped Bernice
was the pressure and the sugar.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.104
We've gotta tell on her
before she tells on you.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.565
I saw Clara steal a coat
from the clothing drive.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.859
Except no one's gonna believe us over her.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.570
We need to catch her red-handed.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.280
Then we can expose her
to the whole church.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.532
Shame. Shame!

17:55.658 --> 17:57.410
But first, off to the hat store.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.453
-Didn't we already--
-Girl, this is Easter.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.042
[Jacqueline] Lillian! We need to talk.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.337
Oh, for Pete's sake. This again?

18:08.421 --> 18:09.922
I couldn't sleep last night.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.216
I couldn't stop thinking about you
meeting the Goodmans

18:12.300 --> 18:14.343
looking like a sack full of other sacks.

18:15.094 --> 18:19.098
Listen, I'm not like you.
I don't care what people think.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.351
You are like me. You're exactly like me!

18:22.435 --> 18:24.353
Because I was you.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.688
What are you talking about?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.648
Not long after I moved to New York,

18:27.732 --> 18:30.776
I was asked out by a hideous
but very wealthy man

18:30.860 --> 18:32.528
who first mistook me for a prostitute.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.779
Aww.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.991
He invited me to the ballet,
but I didn't realize that.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.077
Because back home,
Swan Lake was just a lake.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.663

in the fishing gear...

18:55.468 --> 18:56.844
was me.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.222
Yeah, I know. That was the whole story.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.350
I just don't want that to happen to you.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.185
Especially if you care about Artie.

19:04.268 --> 19:08.856
After that night, I never saw
15-year-old Eric Trump again.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.524
All right, I'll tell you what.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.778
I'll agree to put on one item
of your clothing

19:13.861 --> 19:15.821
if you put on one of mine.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.074
Come upstairs.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.950

an educated guess about you,

during a cocaine bender?
