00:29.395 --> 00:32.436
Will I stay
in your house with Ling?

00:33.315 --> 00:38.946
She doesn't live in my house.
She has her own with many servants.

00:39.030 --> 00:40.532
As a princess should.

00:40.614 --> 00:42.715
Do you still dance with her?

00:43.117 --> 00:44.195
Always.

00:44.951 --> 00:48.038
- I need to use a tree.
- To stand or sit?

00:48.122 --> 00:50.249
- Stand.
- Stop.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.460
- Why?
- He needs to use a tree.

00:55.296 --> 00:57.924
- Take him.
- It's your turn.

00:59.675 --> 01:01.035
Not by my count.

01:13.730 --> 01:15.941
Hey, hey. Eyes on the tree.

01:18.444 --> 01:19.946
Are we nearly there?

01:21.405 --> 01:22.823
What did I say yesterday?

01:23.407 --> 01:25.242
You'll know when you're there.

01:26.743 --> 01:28.287
Same applies today.

01:31.248 --> 01:32.524
What does that hold?

01:33.375 --> 01:35.086
My mantis.

01:37.296 --> 01:38.422
Where is it?

01:40.674 --> 01:41.925
He died.

01:43.969 --> 01:45.261
I'm sorry.

01:57.649 --> 02:00.319
Move! Now!

04:26.465 --> 04:29.093
- Do you see her?
- No.

04:31.928 --> 04:36.475
We've been riding all day.
Have to stop soon. Rest.

04:37.684 --> 04:40.437
She's out there.

04:42.273 --> 04:43.931
And she's coming.

04:45.191 --> 04:46.923
How does she keep up?

04:47.528 --> 04:48.587
Stay.

04:49.780 --> 04:51.147
Ask her.

05:40.038 --> 05:41.915
Another flank shot.

05:41.998 --> 05:44.626
My son will return with your target.

05:44.710 --> 05:48.380
Orus is a fine boy.
Worthy of the Khanate in his own right.

05:48.464 --> 05:50.716
Maybe even more ready than you, Kaidu.

05:50.799 --> 05:52.999
I like it when you talk tough.

05:53.844 --> 05:56.221
Makes it seem as if you have
the muscle to back it up.

05:56.722 --> 05:59.391
But you and I
and everyone around us knows better.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.228
We know how your army
cowered in the canyons for weeks,

06:02.311 --> 06:03.813
surrounded by the Chagataids

06:03.895 --> 06:07.190
and how you cried for help
in every direction.

06:07.273 --> 06:10.068
And did Kublai's House of Tolui
answer the call?

06:10.566 --> 06:13.590
No, it was the House of Ögödei.

06:14.072 --> 06:15.406
My house.

06:15.491 --> 06:18.035
The House of Ögödei
has lorded the favors it's bestowed

06:18.118 --> 06:21.412
on every house represented here...
for generations.

06:21.497 --> 06:23.879
The best part of granting favors,
gentlemen...

06:24.791 --> 06:26.642
is the day they return to you.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.929
- We were supposed to make it quick.
- It was. Too quick.

06:38.013 --> 06:40.056
Oh, yeah?

06:41.182 --> 06:44.102
Besides, no one's going to know
we were gone.

06:44.185 --> 06:46.062
More important matters at hand.

06:46.146 --> 06:49.024
When all this ends, we can hunt and fuck

06:49.107 --> 06:50.525
and live however we want.

06:50.609 --> 06:52.102
You don't believe that.

06:52.694 --> 06:55.462
Someone's going to lose.
Your father or mine.

06:56.031 --> 06:58.199
Neither will do so quietly.

06:58.283 --> 07:02.495
If my father loses fairly,
he'll support Kublai.

07:02.579 --> 07:05.291
He believes in the Khanate too much
to disgrace it.

07:05.374 --> 07:06.542
Not mine.

07:15.967 --> 07:18.595
Kaidu is licking their boots as we speak.

07:18.679 --> 07:20.931
That's how elections work, Kublai.

07:21.014 --> 07:23.809
You should take note of his strategy.
Employ it yourself.

07:23.892 --> 07:26.352
They're my chieftains! Mine!

07:27.103 --> 07:31.942
You may want to pretend
you're enjoying my company.

07:34.653 --> 07:36.363
I'm not upset at you.

07:36.447 --> 07:38.032
They do not know that.

07:38.114 --> 07:41.076
- Oh, they don't care.
- You should.

07:43.078 --> 07:47.749
Perhaps you practice your politics here.
Spread goodwill among your own people.

07:53.422 --> 07:56.467
- My army's bigger than his.
- Oh, excellent news.

07:57.801 --> 08:00.762
You were fine with war
when it was with Ariq.

08:00.846 --> 08:03.139
Don't play dense, it's unbecoming.

08:03.223 --> 08:06.476
How are you so comfortable mocking me?

08:06.560 --> 08:11.148
Ariq plotted with our enemies,
endangered the life of your heir.

08:11.231 --> 08:12.745
He deserved to die.

08:13.358 --> 08:17.445
Kaidu challenged your rule
under the laws of our land.

08:18.780 --> 08:20.782
You cannot cut off his head.

08:22.117 --> 08:27.455
If you do, the legitimacy of your Khanate
will forever be in question.

08:27.539 --> 08:28.665
Your people will wonder

08:28.749 --> 08:32.001
why the great Kublai Khan was so afraid
to let their voices be heard.

08:32.085 --> 08:33.962
- I'm not afraid.
- I know that.

08:34.044 --> 08:36.464
Once again, they do not.

08:42.053 --> 08:43.304
Nice day, uh...

08:49.853 --> 08:52.230
Good effort.

08:59.655 --> 09:02.158
To challenge a sitting Khan?
Unheard of.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.410
Let alone one as unpredictable as Kublai.

09:06.537 --> 09:08.066
We need assurances.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.957
Should we side with you and you lose...

09:11.041 --> 09:13.752
What's to stop him from slaughtering us
for supporting you?

09:13.835 --> 09:16.838
Other than killing him ourselves,
what possible assurances can I give?

09:18.632 --> 09:20.301
No one is suggesting that.

09:22.302 --> 09:23.361
I'd be lying if I said

09:23.386 --> 09:26.847
I was comfortable discussing matters
in front of the Khan's bastard son.

09:26.932 --> 09:28.975
We don't know where his loyalties lie.

09:29.059 --> 09:31.061
Away from prying eyes.

09:31.144 --> 09:33.021
Resolve. How refreshing.

09:34.606 --> 09:36.024
There are no secrets here.

09:36.504 --> 09:38.068
The Khan knows he's been challenged.

09:38.151 --> 09:40.888
Byamba delivered the message himself,
like a good son would.

09:41.220 --> 09:43.699
And returned with the Khan's acceptance
of this challenge.

09:43.782 --> 09:45.154
We heard about the heads.

09:45.576 --> 09:47.466
Very Kublai of him.

09:48.082 --> 09:50.581
You're concerned about Nayan's absence
from our side this week.

09:50.664 --> 09:53.667
- He is the Khan's uncle.
- Loyal uncle.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.138
It's not about one man's vote.

09:55.488 --> 09:57.928
It's about each of you taking a stand
for what you believe in.

09:59.130 --> 10:02.008
About unifying Mongolia as Genghis did.

10:02.646 --> 10:05.581
And unlike the last Kurultai,
I will win or lose this honestly.

10:06.249 --> 10:08.919
Nayan's army and coalition of support
is too great.

10:09.001 --> 10:11.321
We must know who he plans to back.

10:12.463 --> 10:13.812
Arban...

10:14.465 --> 10:18.303
your father was a drunkard who beat
your mother and took her forcibly.

10:18.715 --> 10:20.596
He lacked friends, brains, esteem.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.097
Is this how you garner votes?

10:22.182 --> 10:23.784
What was the only regret
that escaped his lips

10:23.808 --> 10:25.310
at the end of his pathetic life?

10:27.645 --> 10:31.691
That the people of Mongolia allowed
the fat fuck of a thief Kublai

10:31.774 --> 10:33.818
to steal the election with impunity.

10:34.944 --> 10:36.971
Something you'd like
to say to me, bastard?

10:38.614 --> 10:40.572
My father was rightfully elected.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.368
Your mouth was barely dry
of your whore mother's tit

10:43.453 --> 10:44.787
during the last Kurultai.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.781
Good shot, Arban.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.299
We'll be home behind a wall soon.

11:40.092 --> 11:42.406
Then he will be
in someone else's safekeeping.

11:46.098 --> 11:48.198
You said
you didn't choose this place.

11:50.060 --> 11:52.521
- I didn't.
- But you have that golden tablet.

11:52.605 --> 11:55.858
I'd be hunted down and killed.

11:57.777 --> 12:00.174
Every night, I have slept
shackled and guarded.

12:00.488 --> 12:02.795
You've retired
to your quarters unguarded.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.390
For months.

12:05.034 --> 12:08.120
You could've had an eight-hour head start
in any direction you chose.

12:08.954 --> 12:10.665
And yet here you are,

12:11.149 --> 12:16.349
returning home with a child
you just might be delivering to death.

12:17.297 --> 12:19.090
Stop making excuses.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.383
The Great Khan wouldn't lower himself
to kill a boy.

12:21.467 --> 12:24.554
- Children die at the Khan's hands daily.
- That's different.

12:24.637 --> 12:26.764
- Paupers and princes alike.
- That is war.

12:26.847 --> 12:27.932
And what do you call this?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.853
The boy is of more value alive.

12:32.937 --> 12:34.855
Depends on who you're selling to.

12:34.939 --> 12:37.733
Privileged guest might not be worth
as much as cutting his head off

12:37.817 --> 12:40.528
and mounting it
onto your fat Khan's wall.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.824
Can't sleep?

12:59.547 --> 13:01.591
You know what I do
when I can't sleep?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.490
I count the stars in the sky.

13:06.136 --> 13:10.641
I usually get to 73 and don't remember
anything but dreams until sunrise.

13:12.017 --> 13:13.352
You want to try?

13:14.770 --> 13:16.130
Yes.

13:16.856 --> 13:17.982
Right.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.682
That's where I always begin.

13:21.318 --> 13:22.444
Shen.

13:24.530 --> 13:27.450
Is that what you call them? Shen?

13:32.497 --> 13:33.975
We start with Shen.

13:35.958 --> 13:39.086
One, two...

13:39.169 --> 13:42.589
Three, four,

13:42.673 --> 13:48.388
five, six, seven...

13:48.471 --> 13:52.225
Eight, nine...

14:25.716 --> 14:28.469
The silver tree of Karakorum!

14:28.553 --> 14:31.659
Could go for a bowl of wine
from its branches right about now.

14:32.222 --> 14:35.935
So long as I rule Karakorum,
the fountain will never flow again.

14:46.946 --> 14:47.947
Father.

14:56.038 --> 14:57.206
Prince Nayan.

14:59.709 --> 15:03.003
I've never been so pleased
to see a Christian in all my life.

15:04.046 --> 15:05.923
Send word of the outcome, Kaidu.

15:09.844 --> 15:11.178
Go to him.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.407
Extend an invitation.

15:22.607 --> 15:25.193
I don't know
whether I gained or lost a vote there.

15:28.153 --> 15:30.740
There are many months
between now and the Kurultai.

15:30.823 --> 15:34.557
I'm trying to overthrow your father.
Legitimately.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.414
But still...

15:37.246 --> 15:39.790
there are things that you will hear
you do not like.

15:40.457 --> 15:42.209
Things you don't want to believe.

15:43.335 --> 15:47.076
If you ever need to talk,
you'll come to me, yes?

15:51.927 --> 15:53.971
Arban deserved it, by the way.

16:01.562 --> 16:03.481
I'll be home as quickly as I can.

16:11.363 --> 16:13.532
Of course the chieftains think
I should be Khan.

16:13.616 --> 16:16.911
When his days are done, who else
would carry father's banner but me?

16:16.994 --> 16:19.204
You have
the misplaced confidence of a Khan.

16:19.288 --> 16:22.291
I'm strong, handsome,
my wives cry out from my bed.

16:22.374 --> 16:23.583
For you to stop.

16:24.585 --> 16:28.047
Be good.
We don't need any more outbursts.

16:28.130 --> 16:30.257
- When have I ever had an outburst?
- The tree trunk!

16:30.340 --> 16:31.341
That was one time.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.843
And you smashing Suren's jaw
into it comes to mind.

16:33.928 --> 16:35.430
That was one time.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.356
Welcome.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.949
It's an honor to welcome
you to Karakorum.

16:50.527 --> 16:52.696
My father expected you a week ago.

16:52.780 --> 16:55.533
There's much to see
between Cambulac and here.

16:55.616 --> 16:56.867
How was the wedding?

16:57.660 --> 17:00.663
I was pleased to simply
pay my respect to my Khan.

17:00.746 --> 17:04.165
And Lord Kaidu of Karakorum
wishes to pay his respects to you.

17:04.249 --> 17:06.690
He invites you to feast this evening.

17:07.377 --> 17:08.404
I decline.

17:10.589 --> 17:12.800
He'll want us to convince you otherwise.

17:15.051 --> 17:18.097
I'm surprised it's taken you this long
to threaten me, Orus.

17:18.806 --> 17:21.099
That's not a threat. It's an appeal.

17:22.977 --> 17:26.188
Should one cheek be slapped,
turn and offer the other.

17:26.271 --> 17:29.859
- A good lesson in life.
- Had I slapped, you would have felt it.

17:32.527 --> 17:35.641
We need to find a way
to bring you together with my father.

17:35.948 --> 17:38.200
I'll be leaving for my pilgrimage
in three days' time.

17:38.634 --> 17:40.703
If Kaidu wishes to petition
for my support,

17:40.786 --> 17:42.079
he can come to my camp...

17:42.162 --> 17:43.580
on bended knee.

17:45.415 --> 17:47.376
We'll send Father your regards.

18:04.727 --> 18:06.135
Hmm.

18:09.899 --> 18:12.151
- How many?
- Two riders.

18:12.234 --> 18:14.319
And what appears to be a boy.

19:07.915 --> 19:09.667
Rise.

19:12.002 --> 19:13.087
Not you.

19:14.004 --> 19:16.716
Your nose remains to the stone.

19:21.011 --> 19:22.763
The empire is in your debt.

19:24.223 --> 19:26.000
We will return the favor.

19:27.476 --> 19:29.603
I do not serve for reward.

19:29.686 --> 19:32.481
No,
but rewards certainly help, hmm?

19:32.564 --> 19:35.067
My thanks, Sire.

19:35.150 --> 19:38.863
But were it not for Mei Lin's assistance,
I would never have found the boy.

19:38.946 --> 19:40.761
Her contacts remained true.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.159
She bled for the empire
and she saved my life.

19:44.553 --> 19:47.832
Bring me your horse and sword
and I'll commend the whore as I do them.

19:51.250 --> 19:55.420
All I ask is that you allow her to rise
and pay tribute to her Khan.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.471
All right.

20:05.931 --> 20:07.391
Rise.

20:26.618 --> 20:28.375
Pay tribute to me.

20:31.290 --> 20:34.567
Great Khan, my Holy Emperor...

20:35.502 --> 20:38.422
you've honored me with this task.
I honor you with...

20:38.505 --> 20:41.133
You speak of honor,
yet you have none to speak of.

20:41.801 --> 20:45.888
In freedom, you must feel the blowing,
whichever direction the wind takes you.

20:46.388 --> 20:47.687
Do you disagree?

20:49.141 --> 20:50.993
Show me that you disagree.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.896
Stand tall and resolute
for the praise that you deserve

20:54.980 --> 20:56.816
in this moment as I order you down.

20:59.944 --> 21:03.238
If you believe you deserve it,
defy my order.

21:04.448 --> 21:06.075
Down!

21:14.541 --> 21:18.481
Now, tell me, Marco.
Tell me of South China.

21:22.341 --> 21:25.594
The South is still attempting

21:25.677 --> 21:27.929
to come to terms
with the tyranny of their past.

21:29.598 --> 21:30.484
Hmm.

21:30.568 --> 21:33.741
They've been in the dark so long,
the light can hurt their eyes.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.456
Don't get too comfortable now, young man.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.487
You weren't going to say hello?

22:27.072 --> 22:29.742
- Apologies, Jingim.
- Shut up and come here, brother.

22:29.824 --> 22:32.661
I would like to introduce you
to my new bride.

22:32.744 --> 22:34.663
Princess Kokachin...

22:35.915 --> 22:37.958
this is Master Marco Polo.

22:40.835 --> 22:43.254
Master Polo, welcome home.

22:44.506 --> 22:46.300
My thanks, Princess.

22:46.383 --> 22:48.843
All I hear are the praises
of your good name.

22:48.928 --> 22:50.179
Well earned, it seems.

22:52.056 --> 22:53.153
Very kind.

22:53.974 --> 22:55.634
We missed you at the wedding.

22:56.726 --> 22:58.437
And I regret missing it.

23:02.899 --> 23:06.277
Are you unwell?

23:09.489 --> 23:11.111
I believe I am.

23:12.076 --> 23:14.662
- May I retire to my quarters?
- May I escort you?

23:14.744 --> 23:16.639
No, please... stay.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.165
Master Polo.

23:20.084 --> 23:21.271
Princess.

23:27.132 --> 23:28.759
She's quite intriguing.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.686
Wise, funny.

23:32.346 --> 23:34.306
She'll make a splendid queen.

23:43.940 --> 23:46.985
Why did Marco praise you as he did
in the throne room?

23:50.405 --> 23:53.783
Some people think jealousy
is a sign of weakness.

23:55.285 --> 23:56.745
I find it flattering.

23:56.828 --> 23:58.293
It wasn't meant to be.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.308
I don't like being kept in the dark.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.836
I especially don't like
you casting me there.

24:05.529 --> 24:10.217
He defended me because I deserved it
and he's ruled by decency.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.012
Surprised he's survived this long.

24:17.016 --> 24:19.168
What if the Khan
wins the Kurultai?

24:19.893 --> 24:21.654
Back to the original plan?

24:22.854 --> 24:24.856
Killing him
once seemed fulfilling.

24:25.774 --> 24:28.913
A blade. Poisoned dart.

24:29.444 --> 24:31.680
Did you know Mongol burial dictates

24:31.705 --> 24:33.723
that the deceased be
left in the open air,

24:34.662 --> 24:37.787
torn apart and churned
in the stomachs of wild animals

24:37.869 --> 24:39.956
and then turned into shit on the steppe?

24:41.706 --> 24:43.997
There's something attractive about that.

24:44.256 --> 24:48.255
But it's too simple, just killing him.

24:51.425 --> 24:53.968
Better to take everything from him first.

24:54.303 --> 24:57.450
His Empress. His children.

24:59.349 --> 25:00.546
His army.

25:02.269 --> 25:07.066
And finally, that hideous golden chair
he adores above all else.

25:10.735 --> 25:12.487
I want to see Ling.

25:14.114 --> 25:16.325
Were you not
in the throne room earlier?

25:18.368 --> 25:21.786
"Find the Boy Emperor
and I could see my daughter."

25:22.414 --> 25:23.958
Those were your words.

25:24.040 --> 25:28.058
And I will live up to them,
once I'm through with the Boy Emperor.

25:31.298 --> 25:33.258
So you're still going to do it?

25:35.094 --> 25:37.034
You knew this was always the plan.

25:39.098 --> 25:40.243
I know.

25:42.392 --> 25:45.420
Don't let decency get in the way
of seeing your daughter.

25:55.614 --> 25:57.586
Let me take care of you.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.793
Just relax.

26:41.243 --> 26:44.663
Busy Kaidu. Important Kaidu.

26:45.085 --> 26:47.416
It has been hard
to get out here to you, Mother.

26:47.499 --> 26:49.317
You put me out here.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.876
The tree had medicine, you said.

26:54.005 --> 26:55.381
It had spirit.

26:56.341 --> 26:58.552
I didn't say I wanted to live in it.

27:00.485 --> 27:03.349
Nayan has refused to come to you?

27:04.558 --> 27:05.558
Yes.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.645
It's been three days.
He's going to leave.

27:11.648 --> 27:15.485
I will not beg
and I will not make promises.

27:15.569 --> 27:17.458
This is a question of honor.

27:17.821 --> 27:19.796
Said just like your father.

27:20.644 --> 27:23.284
How like you to seek out the worst

27:23.368 --> 27:27.372
of that drunken,
useless shitsack to aspire to.

27:27.872 --> 27:29.708
He claimed honor, too.

27:29.791 --> 27:34.296
Did that stop our enemies of Tolui
from stealing the Khanate?

27:34.963 --> 27:37.757
Does it bother you
that you're always repeating yourself?

27:39.593 --> 27:41.345
You need Nayan.

27:41.845 --> 27:43.430
I know.

27:43.513 --> 27:45.724
Act like it then.

27:46.808 --> 27:53.147
Go and say and do whatever it takes
to gain his acceptance.

27:54.358 --> 27:57.652
The road back to power
is cobbled with indignities.

27:57.736 --> 28:00.405
Be they spilt blood of family,
scraping of knees,

28:00.489 --> 28:02.824
or scrapping of our morals.

28:03.177 --> 28:04.816
When our days are done,

28:05.244 --> 28:08.330
morals are all that stand
between reverence and infamy.

28:12.166 --> 28:15.858
Obscurity is a much worse
fate after death.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.967
One I will not allow to befall you
as it did your father.

28:23.512 --> 28:26.390
Befall me? Or befall you?

28:28.099 --> 28:30.540
We are one and the same, son.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.967
How long were you
toying with them?

29:03.051 --> 29:05.845
- What hour is it?
- Before sundown.

29:06.346 --> 29:10.534
Hmm...
then, give or take, their entire lives.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.686
I brought you a present.

29:16.356 --> 29:18.067
The conquering hero.

29:18.983 --> 29:21.402
Convenient that you just
missed the wedding.

29:25.073 --> 29:26.560
We almost didn't return.

29:26.950 --> 29:28.868
We were attacked
by the Emperor's protector.

29:31.162 --> 29:34.708
Home tastes splendid.

29:36.335 --> 29:40.005
She was an extraordinary fighter
and was beating us easily.

29:40.088 --> 29:43.507
When she recognized my defense,
she hesitated.

29:43.776 --> 29:46.010
My training took her by surprise.

29:48.763 --> 29:49.764
Show me.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.126
Six Harmony Fist.

30:25.592 --> 30:26.767
What do you think?

30:27.471 --> 30:31.638
I think she was surprised
by how sadly you defile the technique.

30:46.154 --> 30:47.154
What's wrong?

30:49.449 --> 30:51.326
There are servants for that. Come here.

30:51.410 --> 30:55.122
- My hands are wet.
- I don't care.

30:55.204 --> 30:59.292
I failed you... again.

31:06.215 --> 31:08.927
I believe it takes two to birth a child.

31:10.094 --> 31:13.014
Well, it takes two to make a child,
one of us births it.

31:13.097 --> 31:14.473
I just get the fun part.

31:14.558 --> 31:16.253
What is your mother going to say?

31:16.851 --> 31:18.468
Does that really concern you?

31:20.188 --> 31:22.460
You didn't marry me because you loved me.

31:23.066 --> 31:26.701
It wasn't as if you were given
a line of women to choose from.

31:28.029 --> 31:29.813
I was forced upon you.

31:30.449 --> 31:32.253
And how lucky I am for that.

31:35.579 --> 31:38.133
We need to pretend
that we like each other.

31:42.251 --> 31:43.692
I do like you.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.090
Pretend that we chose each other.

31:50.594 --> 31:52.011
Then we'll try again.

32:08.570 --> 32:10.566
Do you think about my mother when we...

32:13.449 --> 32:15.659
- Maybe once or twice.
- I don't know why I asked.

32:15.744 --> 32:17.371
I really didn't want to know.

32:27.046 --> 32:30.884
You raise the dead to life in spirit.

32:30.967 --> 32:34.382
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

32:34.971 --> 32:37.847
You bring pardon and peace to the sinner.

32:38.141 --> 32:41.185
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.

32:41.269 --> 32:44.048
You bring light to those in darkness.

32:44.438 --> 32:47.447
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

32:47.692 --> 32:53.072
May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins

32:53.156 --> 32:56.617
and bring us to everlasting life.

32:56.701 --> 32:58.161
Amen.

33:03.291 --> 33:06.419
My disciples, we have guests.

33:07.378 --> 33:12.133
Brother Kaidu, please...
join us in prayer.

33:30.610 --> 33:34.323
I was just coming to pay you a visit
prior to your lunch with the Khan.

33:36.365 --> 33:37.510
An honor.

33:38.785 --> 33:39.955
Are you feeling better?

33:42.706 --> 33:45.028
We're members of the same court now.

33:45.584 --> 33:48.691
We will have to learn
to exist in that court together.

33:49.253 --> 33:52.048
I hope you understand and respect that.

33:52.757 --> 33:53.859
You were right.

33:54.634 --> 33:56.772
All we can change is in this place.

33:58.096 --> 33:59.491
I have done that.

34:00.014 --> 34:01.523
And it's all due to you.

34:02.058 --> 34:04.507
So thank you, Master Polo.

34:05.729 --> 34:08.232
When I returned from Xiangyang,
I looked for you.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.475
I came for you.

34:10.523 --> 34:12.443
And thankfully, I was already gone.

34:16.819 --> 34:18.547
Enjoy your lunch with the Khan.

34:44.768 --> 34:46.770
- I don't wish to be a pessimist...
- But...

34:46.853 --> 34:47.996
Somewhere within these walls,

34:48.021 --> 34:50.188
a young boy's being dressed
for the day ahead.

34:50.273 --> 34:53.936
A young boy.
Not an emperor, a boy. Nothing more.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.862
- And he's ours.
- Yes, but what to do with what's ours?

34:56.946 --> 34:59.115
Your father will honor him
as treasured prisoner.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.344
Of course.

35:00.909 --> 35:03.620
The more the Mongols are reminded
of the conquest of the South,

35:03.703 --> 35:05.389
the more likely they are
to side with Kaidu.

35:05.413 --> 35:07.331
Not all Mongols, brother.

35:07.415 --> 35:09.583
And we cannot cow
to the lowest common thinkers.

35:09.668 --> 35:12.587
We cannot stoke their resentment, not now.
There's too much at stake.

35:12.671 --> 35:13.993
So, what? Hide him from view?

35:14.338 --> 35:17.040
Everything father's fought for in life
has led to this point.

35:17.759 --> 35:21.808
It is our responsibility to guide him
from the past and into the future.

35:22.305 --> 35:25.599
Understatement in victory
is not exactly father's strong suit.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.201
They drowned themselves.

35:41.783 --> 35:43.074
Hundreds.

35:44.077 --> 35:46.537
That was one bend of one river.

35:46.620 --> 35:50.583
There are hundreds more who'd rather
meet their God than fall to you.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.294
The South is not secure.

35:55.296 --> 35:57.090
You're ruining my lunch.

35:59.675 --> 36:01.051
We liberated them.

36:01.723 --> 36:05.026
We've been greeted more
as occupiers than liberators.

36:05.598 --> 36:08.016
Mongol soldiers are still stationed
on every road,

36:08.410 --> 36:09.853
claiming favors in every brothel.

36:09.936 --> 36:12.355
I won't punish my men
for securing the peace

36:12.522 --> 36:14.394
or for reveling with whores.

36:14.816 --> 36:16.338
Let the fish feast.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.320
What happens if they stop
killing themselves

36:19.403 --> 36:20.923
and find the will to start killing us?

36:21.740 --> 36:24.743
Then we bring the full force
of my army upon them.

36:25.534 --> 36:29.247
Well, if I can topple the wall,
I can certainly topple their spirits.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.791
What are we going to do
about their last emperor?

36:37.922 --> 36:39.466
His people will want him freed

36:39.548 --> 36:42.093
whether he remains in a prison
of stone or of gold.

36:43.344 --> 36:45.513
And the Mongols don't care about the boy.

36:45.596 --> 36:47.556
Or the future of their enemies.
Only their own.

36:49.558 --> 36:50.893
Get on with it.

36:52.979 --> 36:56.224
Well, perhaps it would be wise
to not make a show of his capture.

36:56.858 --> 36:58.860
Just let him fade from existence.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.240
Precisely.

37:01.737 --> 37:04.282
Sidao would not have imprisoned you,
Great Khan.

37:04.365 --> 37:06.545
He would have paraded your head
through their streets.

37:08.619 --> 37:10.204
What are you suggesting?

37:13.917 --> 37:15.960
Parade their emperor's head
through our streets.

37:21.090 --> 37:22.801
You're telling me to kill a boy?

37:22.884 --> 37:25.288
He's not a boy, he's a symbol.

37:25.678 --> 37:28.480
Of a time, of a people,
of a way of thinking.

37:28.932 --> 37:32.936
He's hope to a vanquished foe.
And while he lives, hope lives.

37:33.019 --> 37:34.020
Correct, Jingim?

37:34.813 --> 37:37.566
No. Absolutely not correct, Ahmad.

37:37.648 --> 37:40.484
- Let him fade from existence.
- You cannot kill him.

37:41.194 --> 37:42.195
I cannot?

37:43.112 --> 37:45.211
Kaidu has challenged
your authority.

37:45.448 --> 37:48.209
You have the chance to send
a powerful message throughout the kingdom.

37:48.378 --> 37:50.119
No mercy. No prisoners.

37:58.878 --> 38:00.004
He's a child.

38:00.088 --> 38:02.548
You just reported
that the South is not secure.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.510
- I did. But there is...
- No, there is no but.

38:05.593 --> 38:07.761
Even a dog unknowingly craves discipline.

38:07.846 --> 38:10.490
And by the time he attains it,
he has forgotten how hard he was beaten.

38:10.514 --> 38:12.431
I was taken prisoner, too,

38:12.766 --> 38:15.143
but you let me live
and I've served you well.

38:18.189 --> 38:20.483
The boy could prove an asset.

38:43.131 --> 38:44.359
Still don't drink?

38:44.632 --> 38:45.841
As Genghis said,

38:45.925 --> 38:49.804
"Find me a man that doesn't drink,
and that man will lead my armies."

38:49.888 --> 38:53.783
Are you following Genghis
or running from your father?

38:57.896 --> 39:01.733
Would it help you if I told you
this wasn't wine but the blood of Christ?

39:01.999 --> 39:05.160
All the more reason for me
to respectfully abstain.

39:05.611 --> 39:10.832
It is difficult for the faithless
to understand the faithful.

39:11.534 --> 39:13.286
I have faith, Nayan.

39:14.095 --> 39:19.262
In the sun, in the sky,
in the animals I roast.

39:19.750 --> 39:20.751
My children.

39:20.834 --> 39:23.962
And who do you think created
all those things you speak of?

39:24.303 --> 39:27.383
Not a man who claims his father rules
from a palace in the sky

39:27.466 --> 39:28.884
and whose brother is a holy ghost.

39:28.968 --> 39:30.642
You've read the scriptures.

39:31.345 --> 39:32.596
What else do you know?

39:36.142 --> 39:37.582
My father told me...

39:38.102 --> 39:40.359
you can't get anything
unless you ask for it.

39:42.982 --> 39:44.120
Wise.

39:46.402 --> 39:48.495
I need you.

39:49.322 --> 39:51.023
You need my vote.

39:51.615 --> 39:54.076
- I do.
- So, why do I need you?

39:54.160 --> 39:56.287
You will be a friend to the future Khan.

39:56.370 --> 39:59.916
Kublai is my nephew.
Our relations are strong.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.460
How many trips will he allow you
to the pope

40:02.543 --> 40:04.639
before using you to slaughter them?

40:05.160 --> 40:07.841
Under my Khanate,
the West remains unscathed.

40:08.167 --> 40:10.719
You stay out of my business,
I stay out of yours.

40:10.801 --> 40:15.222
I don't concern myself with the future.
Only with what's before me.

40:15.306 --> 40:18.184
And that's a man who loathes
everything that I am

40:18.267 --> 40:20.205
but is now asking for my help.

40:20.894 --> 40:23.313
The chieftains wish to know
who you will support.

40:24.107 --> 40:25.108
Hmm.

40:28.152 --> 40:30.087
Should we discuss concessions then?

40:35.263 --> 40:36.702
I told you I don't drink.

40:37.030 --> 40:39.788
I need to know
what you're willing to concede.

41:02.853 --> 41:05.272
I apologize for wasting your time.

41:10.194 --> 41:12.053
Safe travels, Prince Nayan.

41:43.311 --> 41:46.022
There is a monastery,
I will not tell you where.

41:46.105 --> 41:47.691
I could find out if I wanted to...

41:47.773 --> 41:50.888
But you won't,
because there will never be reason to.

41:51.402 --> 41:54.017
I'll take him, hide him away.
Gone is gone.

41:55.156 --> 41:57.701
Memories are short. They will forget.

41:57.970 --> 41:59.827
And eventually, so will he.

41:59.910 --> 42:01.222
He will never forget.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.914
Cruel living has already stained his mind.

42:04.666 --> 42:08.010
He'll grow older, stronger.
He'll remember.

42:08.502 --> 42:10.728
Then he will come for me.

42:11.046 --> 42:12.631
Who will protect me then?

42:13.132 --> 42:14.514
I will.

42:15.593 --> 42:18.644
Always. If you'll let me.

42:20.013 --> 42:23.041
You are better than this, Kublai.

42:24.017 --> 42:25.081
Am I?

42:26.479 --> 42:27.826
Better than this?

42:31.484 --> 42:33.138
You are the Khan.

42:39.492 --> 42:41.619
And every reign will pass.

43:38.467 --> 43:39.538
Out.

44:07.288 --> 44:09.082
- Have you seen the Khan?
- I have.

44:09.164 --> 44:10.999
Our lord is in the throne room.

44:13.336 --> 44:15.713
Good night, Master Marco.

44:45.493 --> 44:46.577
All the power in the world

44:46.660 --> 44:49.079
and Yusuf chose
to spend his time in this place.

44:49.162 --> 44:50.914
For leisure.

44:51.874 --> 44:53.507
He deserved to be trampled.

44:54.710 --> 44:57.630
- Suits me.
- Well, you don't know any better.

44:58.256 --> 44:59.883
And clearly you don't want to.

44:59.965 --> 45:01.901
When I call for you
and you don't scamper to my side,

45:01.925 --> 45:04.261
- I begin to question your loyalty.
- I was busy.

45:04.345 --> 45:07.015
- Doing what, clearing the sewers?
- Gutters.

45:08.223 --> 45:10.642
- Moving up in the world.
- And you?

45:11.226 --> 45:13.729
Still owe me for the last job
I did for you.

45:18.817 --> 45:20.319
You trust too easily.

45:20.986 --> 45:23.937
If I count it out here,
I won't make it home.

45:24.407 --> 45:28.452
And if this is one coin short...
I know where you live.

45:29.453 --> 45:32.665
How many of your Song dynasty friends
can you gather to work with you?

45:32.748 --> 45:37.336
Depends. When, why, and how much?

45:37.420 --> 45:40.131
When is to be determined, but soon.
Very soon.

45:40.213 --> 45:41.315
And why?

45:42.132 --> 45:45.177
The Khan is about to make
a decision he's going to regret.

45:45.618 --> 45:48.471
And what can we do for you?

45:49.348 --> 45:51.475
Unhinge the gates of hell.

46:45.696 --> 46:47.242
Emperor Zhao Xian...

46:47.781 --> 46:50.618
I sentence you to death.

46:50.701 --> 46:52.290
Do you understand?

47:01.086 --> 47:02.921
Stop, stop.

47:03.839 --> 47:06.800
Stop.

47:10.846 --> 47:12.556
Stop!

47:16.560 --> 47:19.980
Look... here's the dagger.

47:22.608 --> 47:24.152
Place it here.

47:24.234 --> 47:25.736
All right?

47:52.680 --> 47:54.364
When I was your age...

47:55.974 --> 47:57.884
I'd seen men die.

47:58.894 --> 48:00.604
Did you kill them?

48:03.190 --> 48:08.320
At the time, I'd only killed
a rabbit and an antelope.

48:08.862 --> 48:10.155
Did they cry?

48:11.907 --> 48:13.366
The rabbit and the antelope?

48:14.827 --> 48:17.003
The men you watched die.

48:30.843 --> 48:32.595
Some of them, yes.

48:36.599 --> 48:39.379
I've seen bad men die.

48:39.643 --> 48:43.647
Am I bad?
Is that why you want me to die?

48:52.698 --> 48:54.367
I don't want to!

49:07.755 --> 49:09.047
It's all right.

49:14.386 --> 49:15.762
It's all right.

49:28.066 --> 49:29.254
All right.
