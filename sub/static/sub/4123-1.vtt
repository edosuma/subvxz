01:18.155 --> 01:20.457
OK, I... I got it.

01:20.491 --> 01:22.125
My turn.

01:22.159 --> 01:23.993
Oh.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.784
OK.

01:32.988 --> 01:34.955
It's OK, honey.

01:34.990 --> 01:37.157
Grace?

01:46.467 --> 01:48.768
Lori.
- Morning, Dad.

01:48.803 --> 01:52.739
Morning. Have you seen the baby?
- No.

01:52.773 --> 01:54.708
Downstairs?

01:54.742 --> 01:57.194
I... I don't...  I don't know.

02:06.887 --> 02:10.240
Cassie, h-how did...?
That's impossible.

02:10.274 --> 02:12.609
Aw, look at that little face.

02:12.643 --> 02:15.529
She makes you believe
that anything's possible.

02:15.563 --> 02:17.648
But, honey, you were...
- Jake, would you

02:17.682 --> 02:20.251
get the passionflower down for me?

02:20.285 --> 02:22.536
The blue one.

02:22.570 --> 02:23.920
Yeah.

02:25.906 --> 02:27.257
Is that our breakfast?

02:27.291 --> 02:30.177
Oh, it's my natural calming remedy.

02:30.211 --> 02:32.513
Just a touch on Grace's gums...

02:35.550 --> 02:38.185
Mm-hmm, that should do the trick.

02:40.221 --> 02:43.957
How was last night?
- You know the saying, "slept like a baby"?

02:43.992 --> 02:48.245
I didn't.
- Yeah, I thought I heard her a couple times.

02:48.279 --> 02:50.030
It was a rough night.

02:50.064 --> 02:53.166
Yeah, for all of us.
Not enough sleep,

02:53.201 --> 02:56.336
not enough time for each other.
We really need this family vacation.

02:56.371 --> 02:59.089
Vacation?

03:04.078 --> 03:06.246
Court's Lake Family Resort?

03:06.280 --> 03:10.050
We're going on vacation?
Awesome!

03:10.084 --> 03:13.553
The whole family, from baby
Grace on up to Grandpa George.
- What about Brandon?

03:13.587 --> 03:15.472
He'll be home on midterm
break, just in time.

03:15.506 --> 03:18.859
Wow. When do we leave?
- The 17th.

03:18.893 --> 03:21.778
But that's only like six days from now.

03:21.813 --> 03:25.366
The 17th is a very special day.
- It's our anniversary.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.500
You got married on Christmas Eve.

03:27.535 --> 03:29.936
Yes, but the 17th was the day

03:29.971 --> 03:32.790
that I went to Grey House
to investigate an intruder

03:32.824 --> 03:37.544
and spotted this bewitching
woman... at the top of the staircase.

03:37.578 --> 03:39.246
The anniversary of the day you met.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.715
Mm-hmm.
- Wow, hang gliding,

03:41.749 --> 03:44.334
and horses, and look at that beach!

03:44.369 --> 03:47.270
I hope we have good weather.
You know,

03:47.305 --> 03:50.123
I need a new bathing suite.
- Yeah, we both need one.

03:50.158 --> 03:52.442
Why don't we go clothes shopping
this afternoon?

03:52.477 --> 03:55.195
Yeah! I think I'll go get changed.

03:55.230 --> 03:58.332
Well, what do you need to change for?
- Dad,

03:58.366 --> 04:03.053
I can't go shopping like this...
too many buttons.

04:03.087 --> 04:05.856
Can you explain that to me?
- I don't think so.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.692
Very ancient mystery,
women and shopping.

04:08.726 --> 04:11.594
That's my phone.

04:17.267 --> 04:20.921
Derek?  Yeah?  No.

04:20.954 --> 04:23.874
OK, I'll be right there.

04:23.908 --> 04:27.294
Somebody just walked out of the jewelry
store with a very expensive watch.

04:27.328 --> 04:30.313
Not in front of the baby.
- She's asleep, Cassie.

04:30.348 --> 04:32.399
She might pick up on the wrong energy.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.801
On the other hand, we want
to be open in this family.

04:34.835 --> 04:37.054
We can't shield her from all our problems.

04:37.088 --> 04:39.406
Otherwise how will she know
that problems lead to solutions?

04:39.441 --> 04:43.410
But, on the other hand...
- Honey. We only have four hands.

04:43.445 --> 04:46.663
OK, I gotta go.
- OK. Still meet up for dinner?

04:46.698 --> 04:49.633
- Well, at this rate, it'll
probably be another late night.

04:49.667 --> 04:53.220
Do you want to eat late?
- We'll work it out. Bye.

04:53.254 --> 04:54.537
Bye.

05:01.329 --> 05:04.415
Baby's sleeping.
- Oh, bless her little heart.  Let's go.

05:04.449 --> 05:07.851
Go where?     - Your interview.
Interview?

05:07.886 --> 05:10.671
Surely you read my email.
- I guess not.

05:10.705 --> 05:12.739
Madame Mayor, please join
the rest of us

05:12.774 --> 05:15.926
in the 21st century
and read your email!

05:15.960 --> 05:18.729
You need to be downtown
in 20 minutes

05:18.763 --> 05:21.682
to talk with the writer
from Travel-hyphen-bound.org.

05:21.716 --> 05:24.101
Travel-bound.org?
- It's a travel website.

05:24.135 --> 05:27.370
We have been chosen as one
of the 10 most charming towns

05:27.405 --> 05:30.356
in North America.
- Well, that's great.
Well, because I have been

05:30.391 --> 05:33.376
relentlessly campaigning
for the better part of a year,

05:33.410 --> 05:36.963
sending them video tours of all
of our fabulous major attractions

05:36.998 --> 05:39.716
and little shops.
- How do I look?
Oh, well, I suppose

05:39.750 --> 05:42.719
it'll have to do.  Ready?
- Uh, I need one more minute.

05:42.754 --> 05:44.671
I'll go turn the car around.

05:47.141 --> 05:49.559
Maybe we could go to the cafÃ©
before we go shopping.

05:49.594 --> 05:53.530
Lori, I'm so sorry.  I have
to go with Martha right now.

05:53.564 --> 05:57.034
But maybe your friend
Maddy could go with you.
- I don't hang out with Maddy

05:57.068 --> 06:00.653
anymore... or anybody, really.
- Oh, why not?

06:00.688 --> 06:03.890
Well, the girls in my class
are kind of immature.

06:03.924 --> 06:08.529
I see.  Well, even people different
from us have something to offer.

06:08.563 --> 06:13.734
I guess.  I'll stay here and look after Grace.
- Thank you.

06:16.521 --> 06:19.489
Oh, and, um, there's
a fresh pack of diapers

06:19.524 --> 06:22.159
in the garage if she needs a change.

06:22.193 --> 06:24.995
Lots of changes.

06:27.532 --> 06:31.101
This reminds me of family vacations

06:31.135 --> 06:33.103
when the grandkids were still little.

06:33.137 --> 06:35.939
We'd all get up at dawn,

06:35.973 --> 06:39.309
Lori and Brandon still in their pajamas,

06:39.343 --> 06:42.929
we'd all pile into the old
station wagon and hit the road.

06:42.964 --> 06:44.764
Without a destination.

06:44.799 --> 06:46.432
Oh, no GPS.

06:46.467 --> 06:48.602
We'd get off the beaten path.

06:48.636 --> 06:52.405
Every day, a new discovery...
swimming hole,

06:52.440 --> 06:54.991
horseback riding,
a guy who wrestled

06:55.026 --> 06:59.078
alligators, and... ha!...
the world's biggest ball of twine.

06:59.113 --> 07:02.449
Well, there's nothing like taking
a trip with someone you love.

07:02.483 --> 07:06.436
I am so looking forward to it.

07:06.470 --> 07:08.238
Oh.

07:08.272 --> 07:10.974
Beverly.  What's the good word?

07:15.814 --> 07:17.781
When?

07:17.816 --> 07:19.933
I see.

07:19.967 --> 07:23.720
Uh, no, no, no.  Uh...

07:23.754 --> 07:26.105
Th... That's OK.

07:28.175 --> 07:32.145
My deepest sympathies.

07:32.179 --> 07:34.380
Thank you.

07:34.415 --> 07:37.450
George, what was that?

07:37.485 --> 07:39.202
Are you all right?

07:41.122 --> 07:43.123
I need to sit down.

07:48.079 --> 07:50.230
Tommy Manneti died.

07:50.264 --> 07:54.183
Oh, George, I'm so sorry.

07:54.218 --> 07:56.453
He was a good friend of yours.

07:58.573 --> 08:01.608
I haven't seen Tommy in a...

08:01.642 --> 08:04.578
long, long time.
- Are you OK?

08:06.964 --> 08:08.915
Yeah, Tommy had a good life.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.951
A long life.

08:13.788 --> 08:16.389
But...

08:16.423 --> 08:18.424
But what, George?

08:23.081 --> 08:25.448
There he is.  Yoo-hoo!
Mr. Kael!

08:25.482 --> 08:27.617
Morning.

08:27.651 --> 08:29.819
This your mayor?
- Cassie Nightingale.

08:29.853 --> 08:34.157
Henry Kael.  Well, what do
you say let's get on with it?

08:34.191 --> 08:37.844
Now, I thought you could start
with a panoramic view of our
charming main thoroughfare,

08:37.878 --> 08:41.431
and then discover Cassie window shopping
in one of our fine shops, such as...

08:41.465 --> 08:43.884
Martha's Sweet Beginnings
right over there.

08:43.918 --> 08:46.219
If you could stand

08:46.253 --> 08:49.690
right here, and if you would stand here...

08:49.724 --> 08:51.591
Oh.

08:56.447 --> 08:58.515
Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

09:03.437 --> 09:07.541
Your town has been named one of the 10
most charming towns in North America.

09:07.575 --> 09:10.777
What makes Middleton so charming?

09:10.811 --> 09:12.996
We've all heard of magic charm.

09:13.030 --> 09:16.482
Well, Middleton is a special place.

09:21.789 --> 09:25.258
You were talking about Middleton.
- Let me put it another way.

09:25.292 --> 09:31.965
Middleton is the place you'll
find what you're looking for.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.300
Tell me a little more about that.

09:34.334 --> 09:37.287
Well, take me, for example.
I grew up in foster homes,

09:37.321 --> 09:39.789
I left the last one when I was 17,

09:39.823 --> 09:42.259
and I started a family
of my own here in Middleton,

09:42.293 --> 09:45.595
but when I first came here, I didn't have
a family to fall back on,

09:45.629 --> 09:48.115
and the entire town became
a family to me.

09:50.484 --> 09:53.754
I see it every day
in my part-time job as mayor.

09:53.788 --> 09:56.306
Also, as a shop owner, I get
to meet the amazing people

09:56.340 --> 09:59.509
of Middleton on a daily basis,
so I know from personal

09:59.543 --> 10:04.297
experience that Middleton has
a special charm.

10:04.331 --> 10:05.599
OK.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.517
Yeah?  How was it?
- Good.

10:07.551 --> 10:10.387
Bravo!
- You gave me everything I needed.

10:10.421 --> 10:12.639
Oh, I hope so.

10:15.476 --> 10:17.778
I'll be uploading this
onto my blog tonight.

10:17.812 --> 10:19.980
OK.

10:21.783 --> 10:25.702
Oh, no, no, no.  Don't turn that off, not yet.
- Excuse me?

10:27.655 --> 10:30.723
If it's charm you want,
you need to visit

10:30.758 --> 10:32.925
Martha's Sweet Beginnings.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.094
Wedding cakes and truffles

10:35.129 --> 10:38.264
for every special occasion.
- Cute.

10:38.299 --> 10:39.950
Is it open?

10:39.984 --> 10:42.552
- Uh, not yet, but, um...

10:42.587 --> 10:44.554
it could be for you.

10:44.589 --> 10:46.656
I happen to be the sole proprietor.

10:46.691 --> 10:48.391
Come.  Come, come.

11:14.902 --> 11:16.753
Katie!

11:16.787 --> 11:18.621
Katie, over here.

11:21.408 --> 11:23.460
It's Lori, right?
- Right.

11:23.494 --> 11:25.678
Uh, I didn't expect to see you...

11:25.713 --> 11:27.631
I mean here...  I...

11:27.665 --> 11:30.717
I mean now. What's up?
- We're selling

11:30.751 --> 11:33.303
raffle tickets in support of the
cheerleading squad.     - Cool.

11:33.337 --> 11:36.973
So, did you want to buy one?
Or maybe 50?     - How much?

11:37.007 --> 11:40.026
A dollar.
- Uh, let's see.

11:40.060 --> 11:43.730
You know, if you ever need help
selling tickets, I could...

11:43.764 --> 11:45.982
Only the girls on the squad are selling.

11:46.016 --> 11:49.319
Well, uh, I'll take two.

11:54.625 --> 11:58.245
Here you go.  Oh, and make sure you
and your friends come to the game tonight.

11:58.279 --> 12:01.664
The guys need to hear some noise.
- I'd like to, but, uh,

12:01.698 --> 12:05.085
baby duty.

12:05.119 --> 12:06.986
Good luck tonight.

12:18.916 --> 12:23.403
Deputy Derek Sanders.
Good morning, Mr. Perreti.

12:23.437 --> 12:25.605
Well, did you see anyone
wearing any bulky clothing?

12:25.640 --> 12:28.975
Really?  What exactly did they take?

12:29.009 --> 12:31.244
Because that's often
how they hide stolen goods.

12:31.279 --> 12:33.246
Do you recall anyone suspicious?

12:33.281 --> 12:36.583
All right, Mrs. Huxley,
we... I'll be right down.
- We're gonna be right over.

12:36.617 --> 12:40.119
It's a crime wave.
- I've been checking

12:40.154 --> 12:42.372
neighboring towns to see
if they've been hit too.

12:42.406 --> 12:44.291
I'll go down to Huxley Electronics.

12:44.325 --> 12:46.293
And you better go check out
the Perreti shop.

12:46.327 --> 12:48.628
I mean, it's been so crazy lately.

12:48.662 --> 12:51.882
I gotta tell you, it's a relief
when I can head home at night.

12:51.916 --> 12:55.368
Well, I don't get much relief either. Grace
has been keeping us both up half the night.

12:55.403 --> 12:58.187
I think I've see Cassie
for five minutes in five days.

12:58.222 --> 13:02.058
Well, you know Cassie.  You know,
she's probably off cooking up something.

13:02.092 --> 13:04.394
We need this vacation
now more than ever,

13:04.428 --> 13:07.814
but if this keeps up...
- Jake,

13:07.848 --> 13:09.899
you gotta see this.

13:09.933 --> 13:12.068
This is unbelievable.

13:14.137 --> 13:16.323
Is that Cassie?

13:16.357 --> 13:18.458
Yeah.

13:18.492 --> 13:21.411
I'm so sorry I missed
our shopping date yesterday,

13:21.445 --> 13:26.282
Lori. But you know what, I read
that sale lasts two more days,

13:26.317 --> 13:31.004
so we have time, just not right now.

13:31.038 --> 13:33.640
Tell Jim I'll be there in 10,
I'm running behind.

13:33.674 --> 13:36.409
Um...

13:36.443 --> 13:39.545
No, I can't meet you for lunch,

13:39.579 --> 13:42.782
but let me ask George if he can
stop by and keep an eye on Grace

13:42.816 --> 13:45.018
for a little while.  Then you
can go get lunch for yourself.

13:45.052 --> 13:47.821
Cassie, how could you?!

13:47.855 --> 13:51.040
Why not eat at Esspresso's?

13:51.075 --> 13:56.196
A trip to the diner can be very satisfying.

13:56.230 --> 13:57.697
Yes, I'll see you at three.

13:57.731 --> 14:01.034
The most charming

14:01.068 --> 14:03.202
town in America is now

14:03.236 --> 14:05.038
a laughingstock, thanks to you.

14:05.072 --> 14:09.742
You have made a mockery
of our town, Cassie Nightingale.

14:14.498 --> 14:18.217
I'd like to see that again.
- You and half the people on the planet.

14:18.251 --> 14:23.106
Your video has gone viral, and I mean that
in the worst possible sense of the word.

14:23.140 --> 14:25.908
Hm.
- Care to make a comment? No?

14:25.943 --> 14:28.127
Oh, well, thousands of viewers have.

14:28.161 --> 14:31.747
"How'd she do that?"
"Must be magic."

14:31.782 --> 14:34.867
"Where'd that witch go?"

14:34.902 --> 14:39.005
"What a cool disappearing act."
Not one word

14:39.039 --> 14:43.092
about our charming attractions
like Martha's Sweet Beginnings.

14:43.126 --> 14:48.615
They don't even mention Middleton,
only your shop.  Now,
How do you suppose that appears?

14:48.649 --> 14:51.884
Martha, things are rarely
as they first appear.

14:53.804 --> 14:56.773
People are treating Middleton
like it's some sort of Roswell

14:56.807 --> 14:59.159
or... or Bermuda Triangle.

14:59.193 --> 15:01.227
You've turned our cozy

15:01.261 --> 15:04.481
little corner of the state into
some sort of tabloid freak show.

15:04.515 --> 15:07.600
I can't make that video disappear.

15:07.634 --> 15:09.285
No, no, you can't.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.521
But the site is flooded
with negative comments.

15:11.555 --> 15:14.190
Cassie, you've got to do damage control.

15:31.892 --> 15:33.592
Hey, Lori.

15:33.627 --> 15:36.729
Over here.
- Oh, Katie.

15:36.764 --> 15:39.765
Hi.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.902
This is Justin.
- I know you. You're

15:42.937 --> 15:45.438
Brandon's little sister, right?
- Right.

15:45.473 --> 15:49.608
Have a seat.
- We were just talking about you.

15:49.643 --> 15:52.578
Yeah, so, how's it feel
to live with a celebrity?

15:52.613 --> 15:54.797
Uh, what celebrity?
- Your stepmom.

15:54.831 --> 15:58.217
Half a million hits already.
- And the hits keep on comin'.

15:58.251 --> 16:00.219
Cassie's a star.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.828
Can I get a grilled cheese
and fries, please?

16:08.862 --> 16:12.132
No charge for you or your friends.
Just remember to bring Cassie next time.

16:12.166 --> 16:16.586
I want her picture for my celebrity wall.

16:16.620 --> 16:19.305
Thank you.
- See?

16:19.340 --> 16:22.509
You'll never have
to pay for anything again.
- Justin and I are headed

16:22.543 --> 16:25.428
to Bengston's later to check out
the new stuff.  Wanna meet us?

16:25.462 --> 16:29.766
Yeah. Sounds great.  Thanks.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.218
Don't thank us;
you just got us a free lunch.

16:38.993 --> 16:41.244
Aw. Where's Gwen?

16:41.278 --> 16:42.529
She went for a horse-back ride.

16:42.563 --> 16:45.949
Oh, I can watch Grace if you
want to go catch up with her.

16:45.983 --> 16:49.785
Nah, I'll stay put.
I don't want to slow her down.

16:51.789 --> 16:53.356
What are you looking at?

16:53.390 --> 16:54.858
A photo album.

16:54.892 --> 16:56.475
Cars?

16:56.510 --> 16:59.762
Antiques.  Like me.

16:59.797 --> 17:02.548
Which one's you?

17:02.582 --> 17:04.133
Here.

17:04.166 --> 17:07.036
We all dressed alike
in my stock car club.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.921
Check out the sideburns.

17:10.874 --> 17:13.175
Who's that guy next to you?
- Tommy.

17:13.210 --> 17:17.262
Great guy.  Great mechanic.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.432
I just found out he passed away

17:19.465 --> 17:22.768
this morning.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, George.

17:22.801 --> 17:25.605
Yeah.
Lehigh Stock Car Club is no more.

17:25.638 --> 17:28.156
I'm the last man standing.

17:28.191 --> 17:30.243
What am I saying?

17:30.277 --> 17:32.946
Standing?  It's all I can do
to get out this chair.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.464
George.

17:34.498 --> 17:36.716
I'm serious.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.901
Well, then, would you mind
helping me by staying there

17:38.935 --> 17:42.472
a little bit longer?
I need to run downtown and
get some lavender oil for Grace.

17:42.506 --> 17:45.958
Sure.
- Thank you.  Bye, baby.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.148
You better have that rattle looked at.

18:09.183 --> 18:14.353
Yeah, I never heard that before. Maybe
you can take a look when I get back?

18:14.388 --> 18:16.222
All right.

18:26.666 --> 18:29.519
Take your time.  I know
you'll make the right choice.

18:29.553 --> 18:33.723
Jake! What are you doing here?

18:33.757 --> 18:37.527
I was in the neighborhood and I thought
I'd drop by and see you.

18:37.561 --> 18:39.895
I'm glad you did.

18:39.929 --> 18:43.849
Well, with all these extra patrols, we
barely get a chance to see each other.

18:43.883 --> 18:48.488
Mm. How long you got?
- Oh, I've got two minutes.

18:48.522 --> 18:50.290
Oh.
- Cassie, everywhere I go,

18:50.324 --> 18:52.575
people are talking about
this video you're in.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.194
Well, you know, a dozen people
can see the same thing,

18:55.229 --> 18:57.280
and everyone sees something different.

18:57.314 --> 18:59.031
I just hope Grace can

18:59.065 --> 19:01.216
see the best side of me
as she grows up.

19:01.251 --> 19:04.870
Mothering can be quite a challenge.
- Never easy.

19:04.904 --> 19:08.574
I was practically a kid
when Jenny and I had Brandon.

19:08.609 --> 19:11.410
I just wish I could talk
to my own mother

19:11.445 --> 19:14.113
once in a while.
There's so many questions.

19:14.147 --> 19:17.250
Well, you always have a way of
coming up with the right answer.

19:19.119 --> 19:23.138
It's, uh, it's really getting busy in here.
- Mm.

19:23.173 --> 19:25.425
But, uh, just so you know,

19:25.459 --> 19:28.694
shoplifters like crowded places.

19:28.728 --> 19:30.863
Maybe you should think
about closing early today.

19:30.897 --> 19:32.698
Oh, I don't think so.

19:32.732 --> 19:36.568
I have a feeling I need to keep
my doors open for a while.
- Honey,

19:36.603 --> 19:40.155
give yourself a break.
Mmm.

19:40.190 --> 19:42.942
Mmm, I feel suddenly energized.

19:49.866 --> 19:51.367
Hello, Doris.

19:53.787 --> 19:56.589
Hello, Sue Ellen.

19:56.623 --> 19:59.475
Sue Ellen?

19:59.509 --> 20:03.012
Jake, I'd like you to meet Doris,

20:03.046 --> 20:04.463
my foster mother.

20:14.908 --> 20:17.427
What was Cassie like
when she was my age?

20:17.461 --> 20:20.630
Not your typical teenager.
- I bet.

20:20.664 --> 20:22.715
Rather headstrong.
- Headstrong?

20:22.749 --> 20:24.834
It means I had a mind of my own.

20:24.868 --> 20:29.054
It also means intractable and unruly.

20:29.089 --> 20:32.941
Only when the rules became
too hard to follow.

20:32.976 --> 20:37.146
OK.  Uh, I'm gonna go meet my friends.

20:37.181 --> 20:39.281
Oh, which friends?

20:39.316 --> 20:42.168
The ones I met at the diner.

20:42.202 --> 20:43.986
I guess I'll see you later.

20:44.021 --> 20:47.406
Have a good time.

20:47.441 --> 20:51.043
Don't you want to know where she's going?

20:51.077 --> 20:54.246
I do.  I try to know all I can

20:54.281 --> 20:56.382
about my stepdaughter.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.667
Lori's mother did a great job raising them.

20:58.702 --> 21:01.570
I want to do the same for Grace.

21:01.604 --> 21:04.490
They're just so impressionable at that age.

21:04.524 --> 21:07.125
They have their entire life ahead of them.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.929
You want to raise them the right way...

21:09.963 --> 21:12.131
certainly keeping tabs on all their friends.

21:12.165 --> 21:16.803
My instinct tells me that if you trust
them, they'll do the right thing.

21:16.837 --> 21:22.091
My dear, you cannot raise
children entirely on instinct.

21:26.814 --> 21:29.548
So, welcome to Middleton.
This is quite a surprise.

21:29.582 --> 21:31.917
I was just shopping online,

21:31.951 --> 21:34.870
and I clicked on some silly
video, and there you were.

21:34.905 --> 21:37.923
And here you are. Fate.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.676
More like a lucky coincidence.

21:40.711 --> 21:43.128
But I am grateful

21:43.163 --> 21:45.547
for a chance to spend some time
with my Sue Ellen.

21:45.582 --> 21:49.301
Doris, I haven't gone by
that name for a very long time.

21:49.336 --> 21:54.106
And what's with this name,
Cassandra Nightingale?

21:54.140 --> 21:56.909
It's a little... unusual.

21:56.943 --> 22:00.346
Intriguing and unusual.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.181
Like that shop of yours.

22:02.215 --> 22:05.902
Very... unusual.
- Thank you.

22:05.936 --> 22:09.322
You're not still involved
with this magic nonsense?

22:09.356 --> 22:12.575
Sometimes nonsense makes
the most sense.

22:12.609 --> 22:14.777
And you're still talking like that.

22:14.811 --> 22:18.331
Like what?
- In riddles.

22:18.365 --> 22:21.000
When I heard that interview
that you're a mayor

22:21.034 --> 22:24.921
and a business owner, I thought
you'd finally taken my advice to heart

22:24.955 --> 22:28.590
and given up this childish
obsession with hocus-pocus.

22:28.625 --> 22:33.346
Well, even without your advice, I found
a wonderful home and a beautiful family.

22:33.380 --> 22:35.898
But if you had listened to me,
you would have been here

22:35.933 --> 22:39.535
20 years ago.
- It all happened exactly
as it was meant to happen.

22:39.569 --> 22:41.737
I'm not here to argue.

22:41.772 --> 22:44.857
I guess I'm a little...

22:44.892 --> 22:47.727
frazzled.

22:47.761 --> 22:52.030
I... must not be used to traveling alone.

22:52.065 --> 22:54.667
I'm sorry about Larry.

22:54.701 --> 22:58.787
Well, it's only been a couple of years,

22:58.822 --> 23:01.106
but still...

23:03.059 --> 23:07.363
Anyway, perhaps you could
recommend a hotel for me?

23:07.397 --> 23:10.399
Why don't you try the Westerdale Inn?

23:10.433 --> 23:14.119
I think it'll have everything
you're looking for.

23:37.528 --> 23:38.995
Hello, I'm Doris Becker.

23:39.029 --> 23:42.949
I called about the room?
- You're very lucky.

23:42.983 --> 23:45.117
My very last room.
One queen bed.

23:45.152 --> 23:47.286
But I'm afraid there's no view
of Main Street.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.956
Is Main Street all that scenic?

23:49.990 --> 23:55.427
Well, that's the street where
the video was made.  All the new
guests have been asking for it.

23:55.462 --> 23:59.181
But I-I guess you're not here
to see the magic lady.

23:59.216 --> 24:02.084
Sir, there are two sorts of people
that put their faith in magic:

24:02.119 --> 24:05.270
children and fools.
I'm neither.

24:05.305 --> 24:07.589
Very well said.

24:07.624 --> 24:09.926
Why, thank you.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.311
Do you mind if I quote you?

24:12.345 --> 24:15.614
I'm a writer.
Could I get your name?

24:15.649 --> 24:19.235
Doris Becker.
- What are you writing?

24:19.269 --> 24:22.154
My boss wants me to stay
and do a follow up

24:22.189 --> 24:26.826
to my online story about that
vanishing act of a mayor.

24:26.860 --> 24:29.495
You don't sound too happy about it.

24:29.529 --> 24:32.832
Very observant.  That's the first step
toward being a good writer.

24:32.866 --> 24:35.835
And I suppose you're a very good writer.
- Used to be.

24:35.869 --> 24:40.138
Back when I was a real journalist. Now
I'm stuck here in the middle of nowhere

24:40.173 --> 24:42.491
covering all this silly hocus-pocus.

24:42.525 --> 24:45.611
Those were my exact words.
- Great minds think alike.

24:45.645 --> 24:49.448
Henry Kael, travel blogger.

24:49.482 --> 24:52.234
Then you know all the local restaurants?

24:52.269 --> 24:53.869
All the best spots.

24:53.903 --> 24:56.188
Maybe I could suggest something.

25:08.835 --> 25:11.036
You sent her to a hotel?

25:11.070 --> 25:13.789
Oh, I think she'll be in
very good company there.

25:13.823 --> 25:17.643
Cassie, she did take you in
all those years ago.

25:17.677 --> 25:20.129
And I'm deeply grateful for that,

25:20.163 --> 25:22.498
even if we rarely saw eye to eye.

25:22.532 --> 25:25.217
Didn't I hear you say
you wanted someone to turn to?

25:25.251 --> 25:28.387
I just want to be sure it's the right way
to turn, for the baby's sake.

25:28.421 --> 25:32.274
All right, well, don't worry.  I'll let you
know if you're going off course.

25:32.308 --> 25:35.928
Thank you, I'd like that,
a father's perspective.

25:35.962 --> 25:38.597
I need all the help I can get.

25:42.652 --> 25:45.120
Grace was so sweet today.

25:45.155 --> 25:50.676
Well, let's hope she has
sweet dreams so that we can too.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.110
Goodnight.

26:11.514 --> 26:14.100
Congratulations, Martha.
- On what?

26:14.134 --> 26:16.902
Your grand opening.
- Not so very grand, is it?

26:16.937 --> 26:19.772
I wonder where all the customers
are.  Oh, that's right,

26:19.806 --> 26:25.111
there they are, all lined up
to see "the good witch".

26:25.145 --> 26:28.280
Well, I'm sure that'll change
once word gets out about

26:28.314 --> 26:31.667
all the beautiful things
you have inside.  Oh, and...

26:31.701 --> 26:34.403
here's another beautiful thing.

26:34.437 --> 26:36.421
What's this?

26:36.456 --> 26:40.292
It's a good luck gift for your opening.
- Thank you, but,

26:40.326 --> 26:44.380
I mean, literally, what is this?
- An antique whistle.

26:44.414 --> 26:46.898
Does it work?
- Like a charm.

26:46.933 --> 26:48.550
Hm.

26:53.323 --> 26:57.609
Morning, Mrs. Tinsdale.
- Oh, please, call me Martha.

26:57.644 --> 27:00.846
In Middleton greetings are
strictly on a first-name basis.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.565
Thanks for agreeing to another interview.

27:03.599 --> 27:06.985
Oh, I'm so glad to have this opportunity
to tell your readers

27:07.019 --> 27:11.323
that Middleton is so much more than
just the bizarre and unexplained.

27:11.357 --> 27:13.692
Are you referring to the recent rash

27:13.726 --> 27:16.445
of shoplifting crimes?
- Well, I... What?

27:16.479 --> 27:17.746
Where did you hear that?

27:17.780 --> 27:20.866
Any reporter worth his salt
checks the police blotter.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.135
Just a few minor incidents.

27:23.169 --> 27:25.704
Our police are working on it
round the clock.

27:27.490 --> 27:30.375
Has she had crowds like that

27:30.409 --> 27:34.913
all morning?
- Mr. Kael, do you like scones?

27:34.948 --> 27:37.149
How long have you known
your friend Cassie?

27:37.184 --> 27:40.869
I don't know, I guess when she came to
town and opened up that shop.

27:40.904 --> 27:46.075
Just between you and me...
is she for real?

27:46.109 --> 27:50.111
Well, when Cassie did
first arrive in Middleton,

27:50.146 --> 27:52.782
I did wonder if she dabbled in the...

27:52.816 --> 27:54.583
...dark arts.

27:54.617 --> 27:57.920
How did an obviously
well-educated woman

27:57.954 --> 28:00.022
like you get that idea?

28:00.057 --> 28:05.694
Let's just say that
there were... coincidences.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.815
Tell me more about that.

28:14.854 --> 28:16.955
Don't look yet.

28:16.990 --> 28:20.642
Now?
- Now.

28:20.676 --> 28:23.345
Excuse me.

28:23.379 --> 28:26.464
Do you actually plan on buying anything?

28:29.468 --> 28:31.236
So... what do you think?

28:31.270 --> 28:34.022
That color looks great for you.

28:34.056 --> 28:37.609
It's so cool.  And so expensive.

28:37.643 --> 28:40.129
I could do this all day.
- Me too.

28:40.163 --> 28:43.532
But I've run out of money.
What about tonight?

28:43.566 --> 28:48.003
Well, we could go to my place,

28:48.037 --> 28:50.672
but my dad's on my case

28:50.706 --> 28:52.974
to cut the lawn.
- Well, if you want,

28:53.009 --> 28:55.394
we could go to my place later.
- You sure it's OK?

28:55.428 --> 28:58.513
Definitely. Yeah, let's go
to my house tonight.

28:58.547 --> 29:00.866
Great.

29:13.647 --> 29:15.347
Shh.

29:15.382 --> 29:19.151
I spent the whole morning
working on Cassie's car.

29:19.185 --> 29:21.853
Oh, that was nice of you.
- I couldn't fix it.

29:21.888 --> 29:24.689
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Repairs take time.

29:24.724 --> 29:28.644
There was a time
when I could fix anything.

29:28.678 --> 29:32.497
Cars are all about computers now.
I just... hold everybody up.

29:32.532 --> 29:35.167
Ohhh.
- Gwen,

29:35.201 --> 29:37.285
I don't want to go on that vacation.

29:37.320 --> 29:41.456
But, George...
- I'll just drag everybody down.

29:41.491 --> 29:44.210
I was so looking forward to this--

29:44.244 --> 29:47.262
my first vacation with your entire family.

29:47.296 --> 29:49.514
I'm sorry, Gwen.

30:03.029 --> 30:06.215
Oh, wait just a minute.  I'll
untangle those wind chimes for you.

30:06.249 --> 30:08.434
Here, let me help you.

30:08.468 --> 30:10.636
There you go.

30:13.306 --> 30:15.941
Oh, oh, excuse me,

30:15.975 --> 30:19.812
uh, just one minute.  Brandon?

30:19.846 --> 30:24.016
Yeah. I finished my music
project, but the computer file

30:24.050 --> 30:26.568
got corrupted, so I have
to redo a lot of it.

30:26.603 --> 30:28.320
Brandon, how long?

30:28.355 --> 30:31.539
Well, I've gotta have it in
in like three days

30:31.574 --> 30:33.708
or I fail my course, so...

30:33.743 --> 30:36.795
I'm just not sure about
this vacation anymore, Cass.

30:36.829 --> 30:41.099
Well, give it your best shot.
It won't be a family vacation

30:41.133 --> 30:44.669
without the entire family there.
- I'll keep you posted, OK?

30:44.704 --> 30:47.039
OK, bye.
- Bye, Cass.

30:52.728 --> 30:54.613
Hi.
- Hi.

30:54.647 --> 30:57.649
I was going to ask you to lunch,
but see that you're busy.

30:57.684 --> 30:59.051
Oh, very.

31:01.054 --> 31:04.473
We got off on the wrong foot yesterday,
and I feel badly about it.

31:04.507 --> 31:08.978
Me too.
Maybe we can make a fresh start.

31:09.012 --> 31:11.947
Well, I'm completely free today,
Sue Ellen,

31:11.982 --> 31:14.984
so if you get a chance,
just give me a call.

31:15.018 --> 31:18.503
Doris, um...

31:18.538 --> 31:23.375
I was wondering, maybe you could
lend a hand here... now?

31:23.409 --> 31:25.160
OK.

31:34.554 --> 31:38.657
You need a take-a-number system.
- That's a great idea.

31:38.691 --> 31:42.360
You seem to know your way
around a retail business.

31:42.395 --> 31:45.530
Well, I can do a lot of things
if given the chance.

31:45.564 --> 31:49.284
Doris... thank you.

31:52.005 --> 31:54.706
Oh, here, let me help you with that.

32:05.368 --> 32:06.868
Excuse me.

32:09.305 --> 32:11.556
Where does this odd item go?

32:11.591 --> 32:14.559
A scarab pin.
Very popular in ancient Egypt.

32:14.594 --> 32:17.513
I've been trying to find the right spot for it.

32:17.547 --> 32:19.681
I think the display case would be good.

32:19.715 --> 32:24.136
I think it would look best right there.
- No, I don't think so.

32:24.170 --> 32:26.772
Well, maybe you could showcase
it for the other customers.

32:26.806 --> 32:29.558
- That's smart.
Above the lapel?

32:29.592 --> 32:31.744
Above the heart.

32:40.753 --> 32:43.672
I hope you increased our bandwidth,

32:43.706 --> 32:48.960
because our little travel website is
about to see a lot more traffic.

32:48.995 --> 32:53.282
I'm about to send you another
story from charming Middleton.

32:53.316 --> 32:56.301
About Cassie Nightingale.

32:58.171 --> 33:00.939
I've discovered what she's all about,

33:00.973 --> 33:04.076
and the news isn't so charming.

33:10.666 --> 33:14.019
I'm stumped.
- Yeah, you and me both.

33:14.053 --> 33:17.222
You know, some of this loot
looks like it might have been
taken by a guy, and some of it

33:17.256 --> 33:19.574
looks it might have been
taken by a woman.

33:19.609 --> 33:23.829
You know, we might have a team
operation on our hands, Derek.

33:23.863 --> 33:28.500
Or a guy who has a girlfriend
who likes gifts.

33:28.535 --> 33:31.636
I'm glad you have a sense of humor about
it, but the business owners aren't

33:31.670 --> 33:33.438
laughing.
- Well, look, tourism is up,

33:33.472 --> 33:35.723
and people are pouring in
from all over the country.

33:35.758 --> 33:39.344
Which makes it that much easier for
a perp to go unnoticed.

33:39.379 --> 33:41.846
We really have to get
those surveillance cameras in.

33:41.881 --> 33:44.149
I just can't get Cassie
to approve them yet.

33:44.183 --> 33:46.802
What's the problem?
- Money.

33:48.721 --> 33:51.106
You know, she is your wife.
I mean, you could talk to her.

33:51.141 --> 33:53.625
Talk?  We barely see each other.

33:53.660 --> 33:57.028
Chief Russell.

33:57.063 --> 33:59.697
O...OK.

33:59.732 --> 34:01.533
OK, OK.

34:01.567 --> 34:04.619
Thanks.
- What's up?

34:04.654 --> 34:08.456
Oh, that was Lester.  Said he saw an
odd character walking past Martha's shop.

34:08.491 --> 34:11.376
Is he sure it wasn't Martha?

34:11.409 --> 34:14.362
You'd better go down and check it out.

34:47.947 --> 34:49.531
Martha?

34:55.188 --> 34:56.688
Martha?

35:14.974 --> 35:17.759
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!

35:17.793 --> 35:19.761
Police!

35:42.368 --> 35:44.002
I've been robbed!

35:44.036 --> 35:46.288
Robbed, I tell you!
In broad daylight,

35:46.322 --> 35:48.724
in the middle of downtown!
- OK, Martha,

35:48.758 --> 35:50.975
just stay calm.
- What would have happened

35:51.010 --> 35:52.944
if I'd been there?  I could have
lost so much more than just

35:52.979 --> 35:55.297
my cocoa-dusted champagne truffles.

35:55.381 --> 35:58.150
I could have lost

35:58.184 --> 36:00.185
my... my...

36:00.219 --> 36:04.055
Oh, my.  Oh, my.
- OK, oh, sit. Please sit down.

36:04.090 --> 36:07.776
Oh! I want to know why you haven't
been able to catch this fiend!

36:09.545 --> 36:11.830
I just heard.
Martha, I'm so sorry.

36:11.864 --> 36:13.532
Was anything taken?

36:13.566 --> 36:16.151
Only my antique candleholders.

36:16.185 --> 36:19.271
Oh, no.     - And if the police
can't protect us, then we as citizens

36:19.305 --> 36:22.958
need to band together
and look after ourselves.

36:22.992 --> 36:26.494
Look at this.
"Con Woman Cashes In"

36:26.528 --> 36:31.366
"Mayor's Latest Trick: Making Money
Disappear from Tourists' Pockets".

36:34.119 --> 36:36.120
I've seen enough.

36:40.826 --> 36:42.727
Just a sec.

36:51.487 --> 36:53.855
Follow me.

36:55.775 --> 36:58.960
It's kind of my private hangout.

36:58.994 --> 37:03.481
Cool.
- Yeah, it's really nice.

37:03.516 --> 37:07.002
Thanks. You guys can
hang out here any time.

37:09.188 --> 37:12.157
Here you go.  A little payback
for the free lunch.

37:12.191 --> 37:14.343
Wow. It's beautiful.

37:14.377 --> 37:17.712
I had a credit at that store,
and we split the difference.

37:17.746 --> 37:20.098
Thanks, guys.
- So,

37:20.132 --> 37:22.550
it must be nice having a father
who's chief of police, huh?

37:22.584 --> 37:24.436
Yeah, he's a good guy.

37:24.470 --> 37:26.688
I mean, you can get away with anything.

37:26.722 --> 37:30.007
Just the opposite.
You can't get anything past him.

37:32.011 --> 37:35.280
Sherlock Holmes, huh?
- Yeah. He's really good at his job.

37:35.314 --> 37:39.734
Must be working overtime
with all those break-ins.

37:39.769 --> 37:42.287
What's he say about them?

37:42.321 --> 37:45.090
My dad doesn't really talk
about his work at home.

37:45.124 --> 37:48.093
Probably doesn't want to upset you.

37:50.596 --> 37:52.563
Thank you.

37:52.598 --> 37:54.416
Hi.

37:57.002 --> 37:59.604
Where'd everybody go?

37:59.638 --> 38:01.956
Now you see 'em, now you don't.

38:01.991 --> 38:04.876
Henry's article scared them away.

38:04.911 --> 38:09.564
I guess people think magic is
nothing than a cheap trick.

38:09.598 --> 38:12.350
Now you sound a little
like my foster mother.

38:12.385 --> 38:14.435
How are things with Doris?

38:14.470 --> 38:17.522
It's going.
All in the fullness of time.

38:17.557 --> 38:20.525
It was really sweet of you
and Gwen to watch Grace for me.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.694
I'm afraid Gwen's...

38:22.728 --> 38:24.779
a little angry with me right now,

38:24.813 --> 38:26.832
and maybe you will be too.

38:26.866 --> 38:28.266
Cassie, I, uh...

38:28.300 --> 38:32.270
I took the transmission apart
on your car, and...

38:32.304 --> 38:35.039
I've just made the problem worse.

38:35.073 --> 38:36.458
I'm sure it'll all work out.

38:36.492 --> 38:39.177
I've decided I'm not going
to go to that resort

38:39.211 --> 38:42.347
with all of you.
Horses, water skiing,

38:42.381 --> 38:44.398
rock climbing--

38:44.433 --> 38:47.936
a little too strenuous
for someone my age.

38:47.970 --> 38:50.155
I just don't have it in me anymore.

38:50.189 --> 38:52.441
I understand.

38:52.475 --> 38:56.778
But why don't you sleep on it, George?
Don't give up on our trip just yet.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.496
Or that car.

38:58.531 --> 39:00.115
Here.

39:00.149 --> 39:03.718
This... should help.

39:09.358 --> 39:11.125
A pocket knife?

39:11.159 --> 39:12.794
An antique pocket tool.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.964
For an antique guy.

39:15.998 --> 39:19.717
I'm sorry, Cassie, but it's
not an automotive tool.

39:19.751 --> 39:23.955
You'd be surprised how useful
this gadget can be.

39:31.547 --> 39:34.482
We have to stop meeting like this.

39:34.516 --> 39:37.101
Actually, I was looking for you.

39:37.135 --> 39:39.654
About your latest article...
- How did you like it?

39:39.688 --> 39:42.824
I didn't.  You're completely
wrong about Cassie,

39:42.858 --> 39:45.243
and I feel you should print a retraction.

39:45.277 --> 39:48.213
I can't do that.

39:48.247 --> 39:52.717
That story's getting national attention,
more attention than I've had in years.

39:52.751 --> 39:55.387
Then I suppose I'm completely
wrong about you.

39:55.421 --> 40:00.391
I'm not saying this Cassie character
isn't likable, but the evidence--

40:00.426 --> 40:03.228
Henry, Cassie Nightingale is
my foster daughter.

40:06.898 --> 40:09.534
The two of you couldn't be
more different.

40:09.569 --> 40:12.771
Well, we have our differences,
but we're both honest people.

40:12.805 --> 40:15.991
And I'm not sure I can
say the same about you.

40:16.025 --> 40:18.243
I write 'em as I see 'em.

40:18.277 --> 40:21.646
Then perhaps you need
corrective lenses, Mr. Kael.

40:31.457 --> 40:34.592
Think about it.

40:34.627 --> 40:37.011
Hey, Cassie. I want you

40:37.046 --> 40:39.096
to meet my friends Katie and Justin.

40:39.131 --> 40:41.983
Welcome. Katie,

40:42.018 --> 40:44.235
Justin.

40:44.270 --> 40:46.103
I'm Cassie.

40:46.138 --> 40:48.356
You have a wicked cool shop.
- Thank you.

40:48.391 --> 40:51.242
According to Travel Bound,
I'm more wicked than cool.

40:51.277 --> 40:53.444
Yeah, I saw that story about you.

40:53.479 --> 40:56.281
How could he post something
like that?  It's just wrong.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.692
What's that mask over there?

41:12.364 --> 41:14.432
Is it for Halloween?

41:14.467 --> 41:16.885
It's an Italian commedia mask.

41:20.789 --> 41:24.626
The long nose means
the character is a liar.

41:28.264 --> 41:30.899
Hey, we're gonna be late
for the movie.

41:30.933 --> 41:33.301
It was good to meet you.
- Likewise.

41:33.335 --> 41:35.604
Thanks for the distraction.

41:35.638 --> 41:37.455
Excuse me?

41:37.490 --> 41:39.790
The distraction--

41:39.825 --> 41:43.111
all the troubling news in town lately.

41:43.145 --> 41:45.330
Later, Cassie.
- Bye.

41:51.654 --> 41:54.188
It was nice of Doris
to fill in at your shop.

41:54.222 --> 41:57.308
Mm, yes, it was, so we could
have a little family time.

41:57.343 --> 41:58.943
Very little.

41:58.977 --> 42:02.130
Jake, I have to get to that
concerned citizens meeting.

42:02.164 --> 42:05.466
They're more than concerned.
Some are very upset.

42:05.500 --> 42:09.220
All because of that awful article.

42:09.254 --> 42:14.025
Someday Grace will read that article,
and then what will she think of me?

42:14.059 --> 42:16.978
I should go.
- Well, I can give you a ride.

42:17.012 --> 42:18.863
Where are you going?
- To work.

42:18.897 --> 42:21.866
I thought you were going to watch Grace.
- Cassie, I can't keep my eye

42:21.900 --> 42:24.185
on Grace and on every store
on Main Street.

42:24.219 --> 42:26.787
I don't have the resources
to deal with this problem.

42:26.822 --> 42:29.190
And I'm doing everything I can.

42:29.224 --> 42:31.308
And one of those things is
to meet with the people

42:31.343 --> 42:33.995
of this town who are
just as concerned as I am

42:34.029 --> 42:36.297
and upset about Henry's articles.

42:36.331 --> 42:39.216
Lori, I'm sorry,
but can I ask you to...

42:39.251 --> 42:42.671
Sure.  Why not?  It looks like
I'm on cleanup duty anyway.

42:42.705 --> 42:46.725
Thank you.
I'll make it up to you somehow.

42:50.045 --> 42:53.864
Oh, and Grace needs to be fed.
- I'm on it.

42:53.899 --> 42:56.184
If you need more diapers,
they're out in...

42:56.218 --> 42:58.036
They're in the garage.  I know.

42:58.070 --> 43:01.606
Cassie, I've done this before...
like, a lot.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.841
I know.  Thank you.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.258
Fellow concerned citizens
of Middleton,

43:54.293 --> 43:57.962
stay alert, stay vigilant, but above all
stay safe.
- All right, people,

43:57.997 --> 43:59.580
sorry, step back, step back.

43:59.614 --> 44:01.749
I'll need sworn statements
from all of you.

44:01.783 --> 44:04.552
Well, finally, a police officer.
At ease.

44:04.586 --> 44:07.605
What took you so long?
A pressing date with a donut?

44:07.640 --> 44:10.892
Martha, what happened?
- I witnessed a crime

44:10.926 --> 44:13.311
in progress, but he got away.
- Can you describe him?

44:13.345 --> 44:15.697
- Absolutely.
About this tall, white hair,

44:15.731 --> 44:17.682
with a white collar.

44:17.716 --> 44:21.019
Father McNulty is the thief?

44:21.053 --> 44:22.771
Did I say thief?

44:22.805 --> 44:24.689
The man was jaywalking.

44:24.723 --> 44:27.025
OK, people,

44:27.059 --> 44:30.862
everybody get back to your day.
Thank you very much.  The show is over.

44:30.896 --> 44:33.081
Thank you.
- The law is very clear:

44:33.115 --> 44:35.834
"Cross at the green,
not in between."

44:35.868 --> 44:37.401
What's the big idea, Martha?

44:42.208 --> 44:45.426
Citizens for a Safe Middleton,
that's my big idea.

44:45.461 --> 44:48.596
Why don't you just move along?
- I am not moving from

44:48.631 --> 44:52.183
this spot until this crime wave
has been stopped.     - OK.

44:54.653 --> 44:56.120
Hm!

44:56.154 --> 44:59.406
You look very...

44:59.441 --> 45:02.143
intimidating.

45:02.177 --> 45:05.363
Oh, thank you.  My presence here
is meant to act as a deterrent

45:05.397 --> 45:10.184
to crime.  Speaking of which, how
dare you write those terrible
words about Middleton!

45:10.218 --> 45:12.854
You were my inspiration.
- Wha?  Me?

45:12.888 --> 45:16.741
You pointed out the long lines
outside Cassie's shop.

45:16.775 --> 45:19.026
How dare you!

45:19.060 --> 45:22.413
How dare you!  I demand
an immediate retraction!

45:22.447 --> 45:24.315
Got it.  Thank you.

45:26.485 --> 45:27.985
Uh...

45:36.878 --> 45:40.231
Mm, not more bad news.
- There's been another robbery.

45:40.266 --> 45:43.151
Which store this time?
- Well, it wasn't a store.

45:43.185 --> 45:45.436
It was the Crandall home.
They got robbed while they were

45:45.470 --> 45:49.106
at work.
- Between these crimes

45:49.141 --> 45:52.827
and the lack of tourists
and the suspicions about me,

45:52.861 --> 45:56.030
Jake, I'm thinking
of stepping down as mayor.

45:56.064 --> 45:58.666
Oh, honey, why would you do that?

45:58.700 --> 46:00.668
You know the angry citizens
I met with last night?

46:00.702 --> 46:03.137
Yeah.
- They want a full town meeting.

46:03.172 --> 46:05.572
Well, they're angry with me too.

46:05.607 --> 46:09.576
I've been working on this 24/7.
People are scared.

46:09.611 --> 46:12.713
I...

46:12.747 --> 46:15.967
I just don't see how I can go on a
vacation in the middle of this.

46:16.001 --> 46:18.102
Yeah, neither should I.

46:18.137 --> 46:20.171
Well, maybe George can
take the kids.

46:20.206 --> 46:22.306
No, George isn't up for it either,

46:22.340 --> 46:24.775
and Brandon is still struggling
to finish his music project.

46:24.809 --> 46:26.895
So it's settled.

46:26.929 --> 46:31.098
Yeah, I'll call the resort
and give up the room.

46:31.132 --> 46:33.317
Why don't you just put it on hold?

46:33.351 --> 46:37.322
I'll let another family have it.

46:37.356 --> 46:40.324
It's for the best.

46:44.663 --> 46:46.214
So,

46:46.248 --> 46:50.335
how'd all this get here?

46:50.369 --> 46:52.203
How do you think?

46:52.237 --> 46:55.572
You stole it, and you brought it here?

46:55.607 --> 46:59.394
Where's the last place you think
anybody would look?  Hmm?

46:59.428 --> 47:01.745
The home of the police chief
and the mayor.

47:01.780 --> 47:04.348
You have to tell my dad
what you've done.

47:04.382 --> 47:06.467
Forget it.

47:06.502 --> 47:09.020
Then I will.
- Lori, come on.

47:09.054 --> 47:10.721
I have to.  I'm sorry.

47:13.893 --> 47:15.410
OK.

47:15.444 --> 47:17.144
OK, I'll confess.

47:17.178 --> 47:20.765
And I'll... give it all back.

47:20.799 --> 47:25.202
Just give me tonight to think
about how I can explain myself

47:25.236 --> 47:29.740
to do the least bit of damage
to everybody.  OK?

47:29.774 --> 47:32.192
You promise?

47:36.481 --> 47:38.850
OK, then.

47:38.884 --> 47:40.751
Let's go.

47:45.807 --> 47:47.941
If you confess--
- No way.  It's not happening.

47:47.976 --> 47:50.111
Well, what about Lori?
All our stuff is in there?

47:50.145 --> 47:52.814
Chill!  I'll take care of Lori

47:52.848 --> 47:55.066
and her family.

48:13.068 --> 48:15.402
Well,

48:15.437 --> 48:17.704
it happened.

48:17.739 --> 48:22.009
I worked and slaved for months to
attract the Porcelain Figurine Festival

48:22.043 --> 48:25.129
to this town, and now
they're not coming.

48:25.163 --> 48:26.797
I'm sorry.

48:26.831 --> 48:30.934
And what's more, several
Middleton shop owners are

48:30.969 --> 48:34.522
considering pulling out of this
crime-ridden town as well.

48:34.556 --> 48:37.691
Well, I hope you're not one of them.
Middleton needs you, Martha.

48:37.725 --> 48:40.561
You'll be glad to know
I set that reporter straight.

48:40.595 --> 48:44.282
I don't think we're gonna be
seeing any more of Henry Kael's

48:44.316 --> 48:47.051
poisonous little...

48:47.086 --> 48:51.172
How dare he post
such an unflattering photo!

48:51.206 --> 48:56.928
I think the only way to stop this harmful
publicity is for me to step down.

48:56.962 --> 49:00.298
Step down?

49:00.332 --> 49:04.752
Cassie, now is the time
for all of us to step up!

49:04.786 --> 49:07.004
I'm thinking I ought to resign.

49:07.038 --> 49:09.140
After I slaved for months
to get you elected?

49:09.174 --> 49:12.176
What a selfish idea.  Do you have
any idea how that makes me look?

49:12.210 --> 49:14.595
Throw in the towel now?  No!

49:14.629 --> 49:16.847
Not when this town needs you
the most.

49:16.881 --> 49:18.432
You're not going anywhere.

49:18.466 --> 49:20.985
You are going to stay right here
in this mayor's office,

49:21.019 --> 49:22.736
and I go down and try to talk

49:22.770 --> 49:26.357
some good sense into those naysayers.

49:26.391 --> 49:29.443
But, heavens, not dressed
like this.  Honestly,

49:29.477 --> 49:31.895
why didn't you tell me
I looked like a lunatic?

49:40.071 --> 49:41.755
Dad?

49:41.789 --> 49:45.176
Lori.  What brings you here?

49:45.210 --> 49:48.312
Uh, I was wondering...

49:48.347 --> 49:50.932
What?

49:50.966 --> 49:53.617
If you'd heard anything
about those robberies.

49:53.652 --> 49:56.254
No, nothing.

49:56.288 --> 49:59.357
What is it, Lori?

49:59.391 --> 50:03.244
It's... kind of hard to explain.

50:03.278 --> 50:06.597
Yeah, Derek, what is it?

50:08.617 --> 50:11.285
Where?

50:33.091 --> 50:35.325
Derek got an anonymous call

50:35.360 --> 50:37.995
to look out here.
- I can't believe it.

50:38.029 --> 50:41.331
And I sure can't explain it.
- Well,

50:41.366 --> 50:44.034
Lori can. Go ahead, Lori.

50:44.069 --> 50:48.022
It was stolen by my...

50:48.056 --> 50:50.808
friends, Katie and Justin.

50:50.842 --> 50:52.626
They were hiding it out here,

50:52.661 --> 50:54.779
but I only found it yesterday.

50:54.813 --> 50:58.849
Justin promised he'd come forward
first thing this morning.

50:58.884 --> 51:01.669
Where can we find Justin and Katie?

51:01.703 --> 51:05.590
I don't know.
Are you going to arrest them?

51:05.624 --> 51:10.878
Well, we can't arrest them unless we
can tie them to the evidence.

51:10.912 --> 51:15.183
And I can't do that unless
I interview all the shop owners.

51:15.217 --> 51:19.487
Why did you wait so long to tell us?

51:19.521 --> 51:24.275
'Cause... I wanted to give
Katie and Justin a chance

51:24.309 --> 51:26.410
to do the right thing.

51:26.445 --> 51:28.879
It looks bad, doesn't it?
- It doesn't look good.

51:28.913 --> 51:30.631
Well, then again,

51:30.666 --> 51:34.418
looks can be deceiving.

51:34.453 --> 51:37.205
Well, that reporter must have
picked it up on his scanner.

51:37.239 --> 51:39.423
He was already here snooping around,

51:39.458 --> 51:41.542
looking for his next big story.

51:43.328 --> 51:46.430
Cassie, Dad,

51:46.464 --> 51:49.049
I'm really sorry.

51:58.326 --> 52:00.561
Try holding the warm cup
in both hands

52:00.595 --> 52:04.515
and breathe it in before you taste it.
That always comforts me.

52:10.822 --> 52:12.906
I really thought she liked me.

52:12.940 --> 52:16.827
I was hanging out with them
because I was kind of down,

52:16.861 --> 52:19.079
kind of lonely.

52:19.113 --> 52:23.534
And when they were friendly
to me, I couldn't believe it.

52:23.568 --> 52:25.536
I was happy.

52:25.570 --> 52:29.506
Lori, if you're ever feeling lonely,
you can always come to me.

52:31.476 --> 52:33.443
But you were busy

52:33.478 --> 52:36.363
with your own problems.
It's the last thing you needed.

52:36.398 --> 52:39.317
Mm-mm.  No, what I need
more than anything is

52:39.351 --> 52:41.535
for us to be open with each other.

52:41.570 --> 52:44.622
I may not always have
the right answer,

52:44.656 --> 52:47.874
but I promise it'll be the best
answer I know how to give.

52:47.909 --> 52:49.827
Cassie, you're the best.

52:52.281 --> 52:54.498
I still feel so stupid.

52:54.533 --> 52:58.168
No, everything you've done today
tells me you're very smart.

52:58.203 --> 53:02.590
Then why couldn't I see that
Katie and Justin were just using me?

53:02.624 --> 53:07.044
Why couldn't I see that
Katie was just no good?

53:07.078 --> 53:10.281
Well, we can learn
from all kinds of people,

53:10.315 --> 53:13.751
no matter how different they are.

53:13.785 --> 53:16.053
You look like you could use
some comfort food.

53:16.087 --> 53:18.138
What would you like?

53:18.172 --> 53:20.274
Grilled cheese with fries?

53:20.308 --> 53:22.476
That is exactly what we need.

53:31.620 --> 53:33.086
Hi, Doris.

53:33.121 --> 53:36.123
I just heard.  All the stolen
goods in your garage?

53:36.157 --> 53:37.875
I'm afraid so.

53:37.909 --> 53:40.461
It's going to be Henry Kael's
latest headline.

53:40.495 --> 53:44.130
I mean, he practically told me in the
lobby of my hotel as I was checking out.

53:44.165 --> 53:46.300
Hm.  Where are you headed?

53:46.334 --> 53:50.004
Well, I packed up my rental car.
I thought I'd go home.

53:51.890 --> 53:54.708
Well, in that case, welcome home.

53:58.312 --> 53:59.813
Are you sure?

53:59.848 --> 54:01.832
It's the practical thing to do.

54:01.866 --> 54:03.517
Those hotel rates are steep.

54:03.551 --> 54:05.302
You know, you're right.

54:05.336 --> 54:07.238
Where's Lori?

54:07.272 --> 54:09.055
In the kitchen.

54:13.761 --> 54:16.480
How you doing, Lori?

54:16.514 --> 54:18.365
I'm OK.

54:18.399 --> 54:20.784
But with all the evidence against me...

54:20.818 --> 54:24.171
I know in my heart
that you couldn't possibly

54:24.205 --> 54:26.924
have done it.
Because I know Cassie.

54:26.958 --> 54:30.294
And Cassie raised you well.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.382
What is it, dear?

54:34.416 --> 54:39.353
That's something I needed
to hear right now.

54:39.387 --> 54:42.072
Doris, I'm thinking of stepping
down from my job as mayor.

54:42.107 --> 54:46.493
No.  No, that would be the same
as admitting Henry was right.

54:46.528 --> 54:50.197
I love this town, but I have
to be a mother first.

54:50.232 --> 54:52.916
You are a mother first.
One look at Lori

54:52.951 --> 54:56.870
and that sweet baby,
anyone can see that's true.

54:56.905 --> 54:58.755
You're an exceptional mother.

54:58.790 --> 55:03.327
Even with all my "hocus-pocus"?

55:05.163 --> 55:07.597
You raised her the best way
you know how,

55:07.632 --> 55:10.367
which is how I raised you.

55:10.402 --> 55:13.537
Our methods may not have
that much in common, but...

55:13.571 --> 55:16.706
But they do.
They both have love.

55:29.020 --> 55:31.856
Digging up your next scoop?

55:31.890 --> 55:34.157
Where did you come from?

55:34.192 --> 55:37.661
Home.
Grace needs a little fresh air...

55:37.695 --> 55:39.362
so does your point of view.

55:39.397 --> 55:41.449
I see you visited our library.

55:41.483 --> 55:43.701
Checking out the crime beats?

55:43.735 --> 55:48.122
Would you be looking to see
if Lori has any priors?
- I'm just doing my job.

55:48.156 --> 55:50.474
Accuse first and back it up later?

55:50.509 --> 55:53.427
Well, Lori never stole anything,

55:53.462 --> 55:56.430
though I did catch her hand
in the cookie jar once or twice.

55:56.465 --> 55:59.399
Look, you can believe
what you want about me.

55:59.434 --> 56:01.768
And you can believe
what you like about me.

56:01.803 --> 56:05.839
But be careful what you believe,
because that is the world that
you'll create for yourself.

56:05.873 --> 56:08.091
You lost me.

56:08.125 --> 56:10.694
No, I found you,

56:10.728 --> 56:12.997
right here on the steps of City Hall,

56:13.031 --> 56:15.733
believing the absolute worst
about people.

56:15.767 --> 56:19.736
Well, I believe in the innocence
of my daughter.

56:19.771 --> 56:24.241
Try looking for the best in people
and see where it leads you.

56:26.044 --> 56:27.828
I follow the story.

56:27.862 --> 56:32.500
There are a thousand stories
in this charming town.

56:32.534 --> 56:36.420
Well, excuse me.

56:36.454 --> 56:39.173
Grace gets a little restless
when she isn't

56:39.207 --> 56:41.041
moving forward.

57:04.115 --> 57:06.116
Sweet dreams, Grace.

57:17.244 --> 57:19.613
Hi, Brandon.

57:19.647 --> 57:22.600
Uh, I'm just making up the
guestroom for my foster mother.

57:22.634 --> 57:26.386
I think you'll really enjoy meeting her.
How's your school project?

57:26.420 --> 57:29.306
Good. I just got it in to my professor.

57:29.340 --> 57:32.292
Oh, that's great news.
- Except that it took me

57:32.327 --> 57:35.446
so much time that now all
the flights are booked up.

57:35.480 --> 57:39.149
Brandon, I have to tell you,
our vacation was canceled.

57:39.183 --> 57:41.435
Oh.

57:41.469 --> 57:47.107
Well, Cassie, at this point I just want
to get home and see everybody.

57:47.142 --> 57:49.944
But I can't.

57:49.978 --> 57:53.464
And... plus I'm starving
and the commissary is closed.

57:53.498 --> 57:56.216
Oh, have you opened
my care package?

57:56.250 --> 57:59.286
Your what?  Wait. Let me look.

58:04.292 --> 58:07.744
Huh.  Must have just arrived.

58:07.779 --> 58:09.462
Hm, you don't say.

58:11.699 --> 58:13.700
I hope you like it.

58:17.505 --> 58:21.892
Aw!  My favorite cookies!
Hey, thanks!

58:21.926 --> 58:26.262
Try warming them up.  It really
brings out the scent of the cardamom.

58:28.300 --> 58:31.985
Hey, wait a minute.  How'd you
know I would even be here?

58:32.019 --> 58:34.237
Oh, a stepmother knows these things.

58:34.271 --> 58:36.957
Well, thanks again,

58:36.992 --> 58:39.459
and I'll call you if I figure a way outta here.

58:39.493 --> 58:42.129
This whole campus is like a ghost town.

58:42.163 --> 58:45.015
OK, Brandon, talk soon.

58:47.868 --> 58:52.889
Oh, hello, George.  Cassie's here.
- Doris,

58:52.923 --> 58:55.759
I'd like you to meet my friend,
Gwen Harrison.

58:55.793 --> 58:59.680
Hello, Doris.
- Nice to meet you.  Come in.

58:59.714 --> 59:01.014
Thanks.

59:07.655 --> 59:10.607
Well, what have you got there?

59:10.641 --> 59:12.476
We brought Lori a gift.

59:12.510 --> 59:14.527
We heard she was feeling a little low.

59:14.562 --> 59:16.312
Oh, that's nice.  What is it?

59:16.347 --> 59:19.532
It's a desk fountain.
- Oh.

59:19.567 --> 59:22.986
We got it at Cassie's shop.
- Oh, well, then Lori will love it.

59:23.021 --> 59:26.389
Uh-oh.
"Some assembly required."

59:26.424 --> 59:28.391
Oh, I'm sure you can handle that.

59:28.426 --> 59:30.994
Not if it's anything like Cassie's car.

59:31.029 --> 59:33.747
Oh, hi, Gwen,

59:33.782 --> 59:36.833
George.  Hi.
Ooh, that looks familiar.

59:36.868 --> 59:40.136
We hiked all over town.
I'm completely beat.

59:40.171 --> 59:43.390
George, um,

59:43.424 --> 59:45.943
do you think you could summon
the strength to stop by my shop

59:45.977 --> 59:48.579
in about an hour till five?
- Of course.

59:48.613 --> 59:50.647
Thanks. I'm gonna go check on Lori.

59:50.682 --> 59:53.984
She could use a little cheering up.

59:54.018 --> 59:55.318
Oh, um,

59:55.352 --> 59:58.021
while you're there, could you
let the electrician in?

59:58.056 --> 01:00:01.324
I've been trying to get an appointment
for two weeks.     - Yeah.

01:00:08.299 --> 01:00:12.468
Lori?  Guess who's downstairs
with a special delivery.

01:00:26.618 --> 01:00:28.986
Where's Lori?
- She's gone.

01:00:50.808 --> 01:00:53.226
Is someone baking cookies?

01:00:53.261 --> 01:00:55.945
Oh, hey.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.281
Hey. I'm Tara.
- Brandon.

01:00:58.316 --> 01:01:01.718
I thought I was the only one left in the dorm.
- Me too.

01:01:01.752 --> 01:01:06.790
Until I smelled those spice cookies.

01:01:06.824 --> 01:01:09.860
Well?
- Well, what?

01:01:09.894 --> 01:01:14.331
Aren't you going to offer me one?
- Right. Ha! Ha!

01:01:14.365 --> 01:01:16.834
Here.
- Thanks.

01:01:23.107 --> 01:01:24.758
Katie?

01:01:24.792 --> 01:01:27.377
Hi, Lori.

01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:33.684
I just came in here

01:01:33.718 --> 01:01:35.969
to get some of my favorite
comfort food.

01:01:36.004 --> 01:01:39.089
Me too.
But I feel sick.

01:01:41.142 --> 01:01:45.162
I'm sorry.
For everything.

01:01:45.196 --> 01:01:47.981
Then please tell my dad.

01:01:48.015 --> 01:01:50.200
And if I don't,
you'll turn me in, right?

01:01:50.235 --> 01:01:54.655
No.
- Why not?

01:01:54.689 --> 01:01:59.442
'Cause I think you'll feel a whole lot
better if you came forward on your own.

01:02:01.412 --> 01:02:03.380
I'm scared, Lori.

01:02:03.414 --> 01:02:05.299
Me too.

01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:08.635
But things can only get worse if you
make them come and get you.

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:10.504
I'm scared of Justin.

01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:14.675
That's another good reason
to come forward.

01:02:14.709 --> 01:02:17.510
I'll come with you if you want.

01:02:20.798 --> 01:02:25.068
If you did to me what I did
to you... I'd hate you.

01:02:27.138 --> 01:02:30.274
I can't hate anybody.

01:02:30.308 --> 01:02:32.893
Especially a friend.

01:02:43.338 --> 01:02:45.305
What's the problem?

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.308
Your circuits are overloading.  That's
why it's happening intermittently.

01:02:48.343 --> 01:02:50.593
You couldn't fix it?

01:02:50.628 --> 01:02:52.930
No, not without rewiring
the entire building.

01:02:52.964 --> 01:02:55.265
It's this old wiring.
There's no ground for it.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.784
You don't have to rewire.

01:02:57.818 --> 01:03:00.053
You just replace the receptacles

01:03:00.088 --> 01:03:02.789
for the GFIs...
alternative to ground.

01:03:02.823 --> 01:03:06.142
Oh, you can do that?
Great.  Uh, I've got those

01:03:06.176 --> 01:03:09.646
in my truck.
Oh, uh, do you need my tools?

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.432
No.

01:03:12.466 --> 01:03:14.484
I'm fine with this.

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:28.632
She ran out of the house
without a word to anyone.

01:03:28.666 --> 01:03:31.218
Well, I'm sure she'll call.
- And Doris is home.

01:03:31.252 --> 01:03:34.888
She'll let us know
the minute she gets back.
- But I'm concerned. I just...

01:03:34.923 --> 01:03:37.607
I don't want her running
into that kid Justin.

01:03:37.642 --> 01:03:40.260
Put an APB out on his truck.

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:42.128
All right. I'm on it.

01:03:45.282 --> 01:03:48.518
I'm about to upload my story,
and I wanted to give you both

01:03:48.552 --> 01:03:51.488
a chance to comment
before it hits the net.

01:03:51.522 --> 01:03:52.856
Very thoughtful of you.

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.559
Where can I find Lori?
I'd want her statement too.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.630
Did she skip town?

01:04:07.187 --> 01:04:10.490
You're pretty good at blaming
everything on everyone else.

01:04:10.524 --> 01:04:12.826
Why don't you take a look
in the mirror, Mr. Kael?

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:17.163
That's it!  Now you see me,
now you don't.

01:04:17.197 --> 01:04:19.082
What's it, Derek?

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:21.968
You gotta come in here.
You gotta take a look at this.

01:04:22.002 --> 01:04:23.837
This is no time for jokes, Derek.

01:04:23.871 --> 01:04:26.223
The joke's on us.
Look, this is

01:04:26.257 --> 01:04:29.859
the last part of Cassie's video,
right?  But keep watching.

01:04:29.894 --> 01:04:34.481
The solution is right... there.
You see that hand?

01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:39.202
What's he carrying?
- A mirror.

01:04:39.236 --> 01:04:43.240
You can see the edge doesn't match
up right.     - So?

01:04:43.274 --> 01:04:46.876
So?  Some guys were carrying a big
mirror into Perreti's shop.

01:04:46.911 --> 01:04:49.679
And that explains it.

01:04:49.714 --> 01:04:52.048
Now you see me, now you don't.

01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:55.551
Well, how do you explain that flash?
- Here.

01:04:55.586 --> 01:04:58.771
I guess the workers picked it
up, and the sun caught it

01:04:58.806 --> 01:05:02.459
just as Cassie disappeared.
Mystery solved.

01:05:02.493 --> 01:05:05.428
So, upon closer reflection...

01:05:05.463 --> 01:05:08.097
do you see things more clearly now?

01:05:08.132 --> 01:05:11.601
I always thought it was a trick
and now I know it.

01:05:11.635 --> 01:05:13.770
What I don't know is
where your daughter is

01:05:13.804 --> 01:05:17.691
and why she has a garage full
of stolen merchandise.

01:05:17.725 --> 01:05:20.861
Dad?

01:05:20.895 --> 01:05:22.762
Lori.

01:05:25.015 --> 01:05:29.035
My friend Katie wanted
to tell you something.

01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:33.173
Justin wanted to make it look
like Lori was the shoplifter.

01:05:33.207 --> 01:05:35.459
And how do you know that?

01:05:35.493 --> 01:05:37.810
I helped him do it.

01:05:37.845 --> 01:05:40.730
I see.

01:05:40.765 --> 01:05:44.134
Do you?

01:05:44.168 --> 01:05:46.937
Excuse me, I need to...

01:05:46.971 --> 01:05:49.306
reflect.

01:05:54.845 --> 01:05:57.414
Good work, Derek.
- Thanks, Jake.

01:05:57.448 --> 01:05:59.999
I should call your parents, Katie.

01:06:00.034 --> 01:06:02.318
What's gonna happen to me?

01:06:02.352 --> 01:06:04.187
I don't know.

01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:07.491
Shoplifting is a misdemeanor,
but break and enter,

01:06:07.525 --> 01:06:09.292
that's a serious crime.

01:06:09.326 --> 01:06:12.695
But I never did any break-ins.
I promise.

01:06:12.729 --> 01:06:14.798
Well, coming here was a step
in the right direction.

01:06:14.832 --> 01:06:17.167
So, where's Justin?

01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:19.503
Uh, I talked to his dad.
He didn't know.

01:06:19.537 --> 01:06:21.888
And his mom?
- She wouldn't know.  She lives

01:06:21.922 --> 01:06:26.843
on the other side of the country.
I haven't seen Justin since yesterday.

01:06:26.877 --> 01:06:30.180
He was pretty freaked out.
Kind of scary.

01:06:30.214 --> 01:06:33.049
- He's scared too.
We need to find him.

01:07:13.624 --> 01:07:15.308
Good evening, Justin.

01:07:15.342 --> 01:07:17.760
Where'd you come from?

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.681
What are you doing here?

01:07:21.715 --> 01:07:24.984
Well, I thought I would return this
to my shop where it belongs.

01:07:25.018 --> 01:07:29.939
Is that your evidence?  With my
fingerprints all over it, right?

01:07:29.973 --> 01:07:32.692
All I have to do is smash it.

01:07:32.726 --> 01:07:34.911
But you won't,

01:07:34.945 --> 01:07:37.247
because I know how much
it means to you.

01:07:40.034 --> 01:07:42.052
You don't know anything about it.

01:07:42.086 --> 01:07:44.337
The story was in your eyes

01:07:44.371 --> 01:07:46.756
when you first admired it in my shop.

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:50.560
"The Winter Bear."     - I know it.
Right.

01:07:50.595 --> 01:07:53.997
It's about a baby bear
who couldn't hibernate,

01:07:54.031 --> 01:07:57.016
kept everyone awake.
It's a classic story.

01:07:59.136 --> 01:08:02.472
My mom used to read it to me
when I couldn't sleep.

01:08:04.475 --> 01:08:06.342
Stupid, right?

01:08:06.377 --> 01:08:09.028
Why do you say that?

01:08:09.062 --> 01:08:12.966
Mom ran off with some jerk,
left me and dad behind.

01:08:14.885 --> 01:08:16.819
I understand how you feel.

01:08:16.854 --> 01:08:18.638
I doubt it.

01:08:20.474 --> 01:08:22.908
My parents died in a car accident.

01:08:22.943 --> 01:08:25.212
I was raised in foster homes.

01:08:25.246 --> 01:08:28.081
That's a tough break.

01:08:28.115 --> 01:08:32.452
We all lose someone
close to us sooner or later.

01:08:32.486 --> 01:08:34.554
But don't ever lose sight of the people

01:08:34.587 --> 01:08:36.839
who are still here,
people who care about you.

01:08:36.872 --> 01:08:39.091
Like who?

01:08:39.126 --> 01:08:41.611
Your father, I imagine.

01:08:41.645 --> 01:08:43.712
Katie.

01:08:43.747 --> 01:08:46.683
Lori cares.

01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:49.135
Do you really want them to hurt
the way your mother hurt you?

01:09:01.682 --> 01:09:03.149
You're welcome.

01:09:03.183 --> 01:09:05.283
Bye-bye.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.787
Hi.
- Hello again, Mrs. Becker.

01:09:07.822 --> 01:09:10.573
Did you hear how Cassie did
her vanishing act on that video?

01:09:10.608 --> 01:09:13.408
Yes, and that's why
I need to see Henry.

01:09:13.444 --> 01:09:17.180
Have you seen him today?
- A couple hours ago.  He checked out.

01:09:17.214 --> 01:09:19.582
Oh. Did he say where he was going?

01:09:19.617 --> 01:09:23.502
Afraid not.
- OK. Thanks.

01:09:27.558 --> 01:09:29.675
Just making sure the electricity is

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:32.629
working properly.
- A beautiful steady light.

01:09:32.662 --> 01:09:34.981
Thank you for letting
the electrician in, George.

01:09:35.015 --> 01:09:37.265
You're welcome.
- He'd been in twice before, and

01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:39.484
thought he was never gonna
be able to solve the problem.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.604
I figured it out for him.
- Really?

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.175
He's young, he's never seen
wiring quite like this before.

01:09:46.209 --> 01:09:48.877
I guess age has its advantages.

01:09:48.912 --> 01:09:51.831
So, you didn't have to tear into the wall?
- Just the receptacle.

01:09:51.865 --> 01:09:56.085
And all I needed was this

01:09:56.119 --> 01:09:59.756
handy pocket tool.
- It's only as good as the man using it.

01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:01.841
I guess I haven't completely lost my touch.

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:03.959
A magic touch, George.

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:08.264
Thanks, Cassie.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.054
Looking for something?

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.643
I just wanted to recheck my facts.

01:10:19.677 --> 01:10:21.744
Is it true Justin is in custody?

01:10:21.778 --> 01:10:23.729
He turned himself in.

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:28.918
I made a lot of accusations,

01:10:28.953 --> 01:10:32.305
but I'm the guilty one--

01:10:32.339 --> 01:10:34.658
guilty of getting it all wrong.

01:10:36.661 --> 01:10:38.594
I'm sorry, Cassie.

01:10:41.131 --> 01:10:45.034
Could you... tell Doris
how sorry I am too?

01:10:45.069 --> 01:10:47.687
Why don't you tell her yourself?

01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:49.689
I think it's best if I just leave town.

01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:51.491
When are you going?

01:10:51.525 --> 01:10:53.610
I have a 9 pm flight.
- Well, then

01:10:53.644 --> 01:10:55.745
there's still time to do
what you came here for.

01:10:55.779 --> 01:10:58.782
Give a boost to my sagging career?

01:10:58.816 --> 01:11:01.317
I thought you came
to see all the charm

01:11:01.351 --> 01:11:04.570
that Middleton has to offer, and
all the wonderful people here.

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:09.943
Why not give us all a closer look?

01:11:59.109 --> 01:12:00.877
Henry.

01:12:04.381 --> 01:12:06.099
What are you doing here?

01:12:06.133 --> 01:12:08.985
I could ask you the same question.

01:12:09.019 --> 01:12:12.922
I'm tired of asking people questions.

01:12:12.957 --> 01:12:14.924
Mm.

01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:17.160
Here's a nice flat one.

01:12:17.194 --> 01:12:18.478
Give it a toss.

01:12:26.453 --> 01:12:28.237
Woo! Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:12:31.542 --> 01:12:33.877
So, you haven't posted
your final story yet?

01:12:33.911 --> 01:12:36.846
Not yet.  Not till I figure out
what I want to say.

01:12:36.881 --> 01:12:38.814
Why not the facts?

01:12:38.849 --> 01:12:42.918
That was my dream
when I got into this business.

01:12:42.953 --> 01:12:45.771
I wanted to get at the truth.

01:12:45.806 --> 01:12:48.607
Didn't matter if the story was big or small,

01:12:48.642 --> 01:12:51.610
whether people knew my name or not.

01:12:51.645 --> 01:12:53.579
Get people the truth.

01:12:53.614 --> 01:12:57.367
Why don't you tell the truth now?

01:12:59.236 --> 01:13:02.171
There's no place I'd rather be
right now than here--

01:13:02.205 --> 01:13:04.106
that's the truth.

01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:09.496
Well, it is a charming spot.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.714
I mean here...

01:13:11.748 --> 01:13:13.533
with you.

01:13:20.123 --> 01:13:22.475
I still can't get over the fact

01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:24.193
that you actually stopped here.

01:13:24.227 --> 01:13:26.563
I had to, for safety's sake.

01:13:26.597 --> 01:13:29.815
My seatbelt got caught
on the pin Cassie gave me.

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:31.451
Cassie?

01:13:33.454 --> 01:13:36.288
Maybe there is something to all
this magic and fate business.

01:13:36.323 --> 01:13:39.408
Oh, Henry.
We're both intelligent adults,

01:13:39.442 --> 01:13:42.579
and we both know there is
no such thing as magic.

01:13:44.365 --> 01:13:47.250
How you look in this light is magic.

01:13:49.452 --> 01:13:53.873
How you make me feel...
is magic.

01:14:04.752 --> 01:14:06.769
What do you say now?

01:14:06.803 --> 01:14:10.255
I think it's enchanting.

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:12.625
And that's OK by me.

01:14:23.487 --> 01:14:25.204
Whoa.

01:14:25.238 --> 01:14:26.956
Woo!

01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:29.509
Where'd you learn to play like that?

01:14:29.543 --> 01:14:31.794
My aunt has a table in her basement.

01:14:31.828 --> 01:14:34.831
There's not much else to do
in Langford Falls.

01:14:34.865 --> 01:14:36.799
I miss her.

01:14:36.834 --> 01:14:39.268
I haven't been home all semester.

01:14:39.302 --> 01:14:41.437
Well, it's been great
hanging out with you.

01:14:41.471 --> 01:14:45.274
I could have walked past if it hadn't
been for those spice cookies.

01:14:45.308 --> 01:14:47.677
Talk about a lucky coincidence.

01:14:50.964 --> 01:14:53.265
That was no coincidence.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.201
That's Cassie, my stepmother.

01:14:56.236 --> 01:15:00.523
Sounds like you have
an interesting family.

01:15:00.557 --> 01:15:03.392
They're terrific.

01:15:03.426 --> 01:15:06.112
I wish... I could give you a ride home.

01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:09.264
Well, don't feel bad. I'll be all right.

01:15:11.986 --> 01:15:14.287
All alone.

01:15:14.321 --> 01:15:16.906
With my microwave.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.574
And no more cookies.

01:15:29.386 --> 01:15:32.305
You know what I like
about you, Grace?

01:15:32.339 --> 01:15:34.557
Even when things looked
really bad for me,

01:15:34.591 --> 01:15:40.863
you just kept smiling, just like that.

01:15:40.897 --> 01:15:45.584
And it helped.
So... thanks, baby.

01:15:45.619 --> 01:15:48.270
Grace has your smile.

01:15:50.474 --> 01:15:54.009
Maybe yours is a little bigger.
- I can't help it.

01:15:54.044 --> 01:15:59.048
Nothing makes me happier than
to see my two favorite girls together.

01:15:59.082 --> 01:16:02.284
And where's your smile?

01:16:02.318 --> 01:16:04.420
I was just thinking about Katie.

01:16:04.455 --> 01:16:06.589
Her mom was pretty angry
when she came

01:16:06.623 --> 01:16:08.123
to get her.

01:16:08.158 --> 01:16:11.093
Well, Katie's on the right
path now, thanks to you.

01:16:11.127 --> 01:16:13.596
It took a lot of courage
to come forward the way you did.

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:15.948
The shop owners were
pretty upset with her.

01:16:17.717 --> 01:16:19.885
If there's one thing
I know about Middleton:

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.355
the people here are very forgiving.

01:16:23.389 --> 01:16:26.225
Well, I should go get
a fresh onesie for Grace.

01:16:26.259 --> 01:16:29.779
Oh, it's in the dryer.  I'll get it.
- No, no, stay with your sister.

01:16:29.813 --> 01:16:34.617
She is a pretty cool sister,
once you get to know her.

01:16:34.651 --> 01:16:36.869
Well, if she turns out to be
half the young woman you are,

01:16:36.903 --> 01:16:38.904
Lori, I'll know I was a good mother.

01:16:40.907 --> 01:16:43.109
It's too bad about our vacation.

01:16:43.143 --> 01:16:45.661
Grace would have loved
the new sights and sounds.

01:16:45.695 --> 01:16:47.329
Surrounded by all of us.

01:16:47.363 --> 01:16:50.633
At least I can get you and Dad
your anniversary gift.

01:16:50.667 --> 01:16:53.619
I have my gifts already.

01:16:56.589 --> 01:16:58.341
Mmm.

01:17:19.078 --> 01:17:20.746
Hi, Cassie.

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.798
What happened to "Sue Ellen"?

01:17:22.832 --> 01:17:24.834
Oh, she moved away.

01:17:24.868 --> 01:17:26.152
She grew up

01:17:26.186 --> 01:17:29.071
and created a wonderful
new life for herself.

01:17:31.074 --> 01:17:34.060
I've come to help
with your customers.

01:17:34.094 --> 01:17:36.929
Oh, thank you, Doris,
but, as you can see,

01:17:36.963 --> 01:17:39.248
that's hardly necessary.

01:17:42.019 --> 01:17:44.420
Oh, I have a premonition
that's about to change.

01:17:44.454 --> 01:17:47.657
A premonition? You?
- Yes.

01:17:47.691 --> 01:17:49.758
Strictly based on recent events.

01:17:49.793 --> 01:17:53.329
Although I'd have to say there's
some sort of magic in the air.

01:17:53.363 --> 01:17:55.297
Really?

01:17:55.332 --> 01:17:57.299
I found Henry yesterday.

01:17:57.334 --> 01:17:59.702
Or he found me.

01:17:59.737 --> 01:18:02.805
I'm not exactly sure how that happened.

01:18:12.199 --> 01:18:15.184
But most important,

01:18:15.218 --> 01:18:17.419
I found my foster daughter,

01:18:17.454 --> 01:18:21.807
and I am deeply grateful for that.

01:18:21.842 --> 01:18:24.627
I'm so glad you came looking for me.

01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:29.631
I've been very controlling my entire life...

01:18:31.634 --> 01:18:33.936
...because I was just afraid
of losing the love

01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:37.456
of those I cared about the most.

01:18:37.491 --> 01:18:39.608
When you left,

01:18:39.642 --> 01:18:42.278
when my husband passed away recently,

01:18:42.312 --> 01:18:45.298
those were earthquakes.

01:18:45.332 --> 01:18:48.701
But you are loved, Doris.
You know that, don't you?

01:18:48.735 --> 01:18:51.537
I do now.

01:18:51.571 --> 01:18:55.057
And I'm so grateful
for the love you showed me,

01:18:55.091 --> 01:18:57.392
then and now.

01:18:57.427 --> 01:18:59.395
You have a kind heart,

01:18:59.429 --> 01:19:02.281
Doris, and a strong will--

01:19:02.315 --> 01:19:05.600
things that I learned from you
when I was young.

01:19:05.635 --> 01:19:09.104
And if you weren't
such a good mother,

01:19:09.139 --> 01:19:11.840
I don't know that I would have
made it these last few days.

01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:13.442
Thank you.

01:19:13.477 --> 01:19:15.811
You're welcome.

01:19:15.845 --> 01:19:19.014
You have such a full plate,
I have no idea how you manage.

01:19:19.049 --> 01:19:22.768
had a foster mother who taught me to
be appreciative of everything on my plate.

01:19:22.803 --> 01:19:26.738
Oh, look.

01:19:26.773 --> 01:19:29.642
Customers.

01:19:39.819 --> 01:19:42.087
Always looking out for Middleton.

01:19:42.122 --> 01:19:44.957
Well, I'm glad someone noticed.

01:19:44.992 --> 01:19:46.959
Thank you, Martha.  Yeah,
would have been more burglaries

01:19:46.994 --> 01:19:48.961
if you hadn't made
your presence known.

01:19:48.996 --> 01:19:51.397
But now all the crooks are caught

01:19:51.431 --> 01:19:53.749
and the streets are safe
and no one needs

01:19:53.783 --> 01:19:55.818
their fearless whistleblower anymore.

01:19:55.852 --> 01:19:58.103
You heard about Katie?

01:19:58.137 --> 01:20:01.123
Because she came forward
she may only face probation.

01:20:01.158 --> 01:20:03.159
But, uh, well, a couple
of the shop owners,

01:20:03.193 --> 01:20:05.127
they want her to be locked up.

01:20:05.161 --> 01:20:06.795
Oh, for heaven's sake.

01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:08.797
I mean, yes, the girl was an accessory,

01:20:08.832 --> 01:20:11.951
but there are other ways
to pay your debt to society.

01:20:11.985 --> 01:20:13.585
Really?

01:20:13.619 --> 01:20:16.322
Cassie, my own two boys ran
afoul of the law, remember?

01:20:16.356 --> 01:20:18.674
And they paid with community service.

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:21.927
Perhaps I could talk to the angry owners.
- That's a great idea.

01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:25.631
Well, you know, I am an idea person.

01:20:25.665 --> 01:20:27.666
And as a shop owner,
you are respected

01:20:27.701 --> 01:20:29.985
by the business community.
- That's true.

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.239
I like the sound of that--
"business community".

01:20:33.273 --> 01:20:37.994
You know, it is high time that someone
re-energized our chamber of commerce.

01:20:38.028 --> 01:20:40.363
You'd be the perfect person.
- Cassie, I'm way ahead of you.

01:20:40.397 --> 01:20:42.281
As always.
- I will be Middleton's

01:20:42.315 --> 01:20:45.584
business coach. I already have
my coach's whistle.

01:20:45.618 --> 01:20:47.970
And, of course, I'll continue
to coach your political career.

01:20:48.004 --> 01:20:51.139
How could I ever consider stepping
down with you as a supporter?

01:20:51.174 --> 01:20:53.209
Beats me.
- As long as you have my back,

01:20:53.243 --> 01:20:55.477
Martha, I know
I can make it work.

01:20:55.512 --> 01:20:58.480
- If you ever need a little help,
you just give me a little whistle.

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.654
Come on.

01:21:05.688 --> 01:21:07.573
Darn.  There's no room here.

01:21:07.607 --> 01:21:10.276
It's a good thing that hood is
muffling your voice.

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:13.062
I have a feeling your language
is getting a little salty.

01:21:13.096 --> 01:21:14.897
Pass me a 13mm, will ya?

01:21:14.931 --> 01:21:17.733
Oh...

01:21:17.767 --> 01:21:20.836
Forget it.
You wouldn't know what a... 13...

01:21:20.871 --> 01:21:25.074
You never cease to amaze me, Gwen.

01:21:25.108 --> 01:21:28.411
I used them all the time
on my old Enfield motorcycle.

01:21:28.445 --> 01:21:31.130
You had an Enfield?

01:21:31.164 --> 01:21:34.333
Yeah, my brother and I shared it.
But I did most of the repairs.

01:21:34.367 --> 01:21:36.952
Ha! Ha! Ha!  Got it.

01:21:38.755 --> 01:21:41.056
You really had an Enfield?

01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:43.058
Don't act so surprised.

01:21:43.092 --> 01:21:44.860
I may not look it,

01:21:44.894 --> 01:21:48.563
but I've been around
awhile too, you know.

01:21:48.598 --> 01:21:50.899
You look beautiful, Gwen.

01:21:50.934 --> 01:21:54.736
Like a perfectly overhauled transmission.

01:21:54.771 --> 01:21:57.489
Oh, George, you say the sweetest things.

01:21:59.843 --> 01:22:02.345
We've both been around, all right.

01:22:04.348 --> 01:22:05.948
How'd you feel about...

01:22:05.983 --> 01:22:08.501
gettin' around with me from now on?

01:22:08.535 --> 01:22:10.870
What are you driving at, George?

01:22:10.904 --> 01:22:13.322
Would you marry me, Gwen?

01:22:18.912 --> 01:22:21.047
Yes.

01:22:21.081 --> 01:22:23.265
I'd hug you

01:22:23.299 --> 01:22:26.802
if you weren't such a mess!
- Here's a clean spot.

01:22:39.299 --> 01:22:41.917
"In the short time I was
there, I made new friends

01:22:41.952 --> 01:22:43.618
"and had an enchanting time,

01:22:43.653 --> 01:22:45.838
"in large part due
to Middleton's mayor,

01:22:45.872 --> 01:22:49.291
"Cassie Nightingale.
So, is she magic, or isn't she?

01:22:49.326 --> 01:22:52.127
"This reporter has decided
it doesn't matter.

01:22:52.162 --> 01:22:55.747
"Cassandra Nightingale
makes you believe,

01:22:55.782 --> 01:22:57.900
and sometimes that's enough."

01:22:57.934 --> 01:22:59.401
There's more.

01:22:59.435 --> 01:23:03.172
Well, as the man says,
sometimes that's enough.

01:23:03.206 --> 01:23:05.390
I'll help.

01:23:05.425 --> 01:23:08.727
OK.  Good.

01:23:08.761 --> 01:23:10.679
OK.
- Here you go.

01:23:10.713 --> 01:23:12.847
Yup.

01:23:12.882 --> 01:23:15.017
That was George.

01:23:15.051 --> 01:23:17.987
He fixed the car.
He's on his way over and he said

01:23:18.021 --> 01:23:20.238
they have some big news

01:23:20.273 --> 01:23:22.124
aside from the car.

01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:24.510
It's about time.

01:23:24.544 --> 01:23:28.130
You don't think that they're, uh...?
- It's just a hunch.

01:23:28.165 --> 01:23:30.465
Grandpa's coming over with the car,

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.884
but now we have nowhere to go.
- Well, I can

01:23:32.919 --> 01:23:36.838
check Henry's sites, but it's the height of
the season.  I doubt there's any room.

01:23:36.873 --> 01:23:39.274
You just have to know where to look.

01:23:39.308 --> 01:23:43.428
Oh, there's room.
There's lots of room.

01:23:43.463 --> 01:23:46.681
I booked a camping trip to
Langford Falls for our whole family.

01:23:46.716 --> 01:23:48.567
What a great idea!
- I'm excited.

01:23:48.602 --> 01:23:52.021
I wasn't going to let another anniversary
go by without celebrating with my family.

01:23:54.274 --> 01:23:57.609
How romantic.
- I will have to get

01:23:57.644 --> 01:24:00.429
an anniversary cake from Martha.
- Wait,

01:24:00.463 --> 01:24:02.147
Langford Falls?

01:24:02.181 --> 01:24:04.400
I was just texting Brandon,
and he said

01:24:04.434 --> 01:24:08.320
that the girl he met, Tara, lives around
there.  Maybe she could give him a ride.

01:24:08.354 --> 01:24:10.072
Wouldn't that be lucky.

01:24:10.106 --> 01:24:15.127
Well, I don't know if luck had
anything to do with it.

01:24:15.161 --> 01:24:17.913
Brandon did say that
he met Tara while he was

01:24:17.947 --> 01:24:20.249
warming up Cassie's cookies
in the microwave.

01:24:20.283 --> 01:24:25.220
Lori, you know your stepmother --
she's always got something cooking.

01:24:25.255 --> 01:24:29.141
Oh. Looks like it's time to turn
those steaks.  I'll get it.

01:24:29.175 --> 01:24:30.426
You sure?

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:34.563
And I think it's bedtime
for Grace Doris Russell.

01:24:39.719 --> 01:24:41.403
"Doris" is her middle name?

01:24:41.437 --> 01:24:43.305
Yeah, it sure is.

01:24:45.308 --> 01:24:47.243
When did you name her that?

01:24:48.695 --> 01:24:51.413
On the wonderful day she was born.

01:24:51.448 --> 01:24:52.698
Oh!

01:24:58.721 --> 01:25:00.356
I'll go with you.

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:12.784
OK, come here.

01:25:16.589 --> 01:25:20.809
Cassie, I swear she's grown in
the time that Doris has been here.

01:25:20.843 --> 01:25:22.545
We all have.

01:25:22.579 --> 01:25:24.646
Between you and me,

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.932
did you know that that mirror was
gonna be there at that exact time?

01:25:32.205 --> 01:25:35.424
I hope the weather's good up in Langford.

01:25:35.458 --> 01:25:37.760
It might rain the entire week
we're camping,

01:25:37.794 --> 01:25:41.080
but if we're together, all we'll
remember are the rainbows.

01:25:51.841 --> 01:25:53.441
Magical.

01:25:53.476 --> 01:25:55.844
Hm.  Like mother, like daughter.
