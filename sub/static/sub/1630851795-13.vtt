[narrator]
<i>  this time on moonshiners...</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:12.478
All the agave
that we have here
is blue agave.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.814
-Okay.
-[man] it's the right agave
to make tequila.

00:15.816 --> 00:19.084
<i> [tim] I came to mexico</i>
<i>  to learn as much as I can</i>
<i>  about the history of tequila</i>

00:19.086 --> 00:20.619
<i>  and also how it's made.</i>

00:20.621 --> 00:21.920
[man] this is young agave.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.556
We have to wait,
almost seven, eight years.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.325
[tim] that's a long time.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.895
[tickle] all right,
take that brush that's yonder.
And brush them bees off.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.765
[josh] oh no. They're pissed,
they're pissed.
Hot damn, they're pissed!

00:32.767 --> 00:36.835
[shouts] whoo!
Ow, ow, ow!

00:36.837 --> 00:39.705
[mark] oh hell, I don't know
if we can read this.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.842
This temperature has got to be
between 150 and 160 degrees.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.146
We can't get enough
liquid out of it
at this stage.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.417
<i> [man] this is how we make</i>
<i>  the moonshine.</i>

00:51.786 --> 00:54.219
[fiddle music playing]

00:57.058 --> 01:01.560
all right,
well here's the bees
over here, josh.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.397
I've been saving the honey up,
they really been producing.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.733
[narrator]
<i>  in pittsylvania county,</i>
<i>  virginia,</i>

01:07.735 --> 01:10.736
<i>  tickle and josh</i>
<i>  prepare to harvest</i>
<i>  a key ingredient.</i>

01:10.738 --> 01:12.905
<i>  In an ambitious</i>
<i>  new liquor recipe</i>

01:12.907 --> 01:15.607
<i>  they're cooking up with</i>
<i>  henry and kenny law.</i>

01:15.609 --> 01:18.777
We're going to be making
a corn and wheat based liquor

01:18.779 --> 01:20.913
and we're going to use
honey in there as well.

01:20.915 --> 01:24.383
It just so happens,
I've got a lot of honey bees.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.420
So how come you get a bee suit
and I don't?

01:28.422 --> 01:31.690
I mean, I'd give you this one
but you're quite a bit taller
than I am,

01:31.692 --> 01:34.493
uh, you won't even,
actually fit in the suit.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.396
-That's what duct tape's
good for.
-Is it, is that right?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.598
-You want me to smoke them?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.234
<i> [tickle] we're going to be</i>
<i>  using a smoker to allow us</i>

01:42.236 --> 01:43.635
<i>  to be able to get into</i>
<i>  these hives.</i>

01:43.637 --> 01:46.705
Smoke makes bees think
that there's a fire.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.841
<i> And then they go into the mode</i>
<i>  to leave their hive.</i>

01:48.843 --> 01:50.576
[tickle] just, kind of,
lift the lid up.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.511
-[josh] you sure
about this now?
-Yes!

01:52.513 --> 01:54.680
<i> [tickle] therefore,</i>
<i>  they're not worried</i>
<i>  about the honey</i>

01:54.682 --> 01:56.815
and I can get right in there
and take the honey.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.016
They don't even know
I'm there.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.351
All right.

02:00.955 --> 02:01.386
Okay.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.358
Mmm-hmm.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.661
That is a nice comb of honey,
right there.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.830
<i> [josh] I'm thinking,</i>
<i>  "well hell I've robbed</i>
<i>  some honey bees</i>

02:11.832 --> 02:14.933
<i>  with no suit on before,</i>
<i>  I think I can go handle it.</i>

02:14.935 --> 02:16.301
Just remain calm,
no matter what."

02:16.303 --> 02:19.238
I'm like, "I got this."

02:19.240 --> 02:23.142
<i>  I ain't afraid of these bees,</i>
<i>  I'm only afraid of</i>
<i>  getting stung. [laughs]</i>

02:24.979 --> 02:27.112
[tickle] all right,
I'm going to need
your help here.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.547
All right.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.049
Do you want to hold the comb
or do you want to
brush the bees off it?

02:31.051 --> 02:32.885
[josh] god damn,
right on the face. [bleep]

02:32.887 --> 02:34.887
man! [bleep]

02:34.889 --> 02:36.421
-[tickle] they get you?
-They're pissed.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.725
You lucky, dog,
you got a bee suit.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.627
-[tickle] well...
-[josh] well, nothing.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.396
[tickle] well, it's because
I've got bees.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.933
All right, take that brush
that's yonder.
And brush them bees off.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.802
Oh no. They're pissed,
they're pissed.
Whoo, they're pissed.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.004
-Whoo! Ow!
-[tickle] okay.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.906
[bleep]

02:53.941 --> 02:56.475
ow! [bleep]

02:56.477 --> 03:00.212
for one thing,
josh has on a black shirt.

03:00.214 --> 03:04.316
Now, bees instinctively think
this is a bear.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.085
[josh] hot damn,
they're pissed. Whoo!

03:07.388 --> 03:08.420
Man!

03:08.422 --> 03:11.423
Bears are notorious
for robbing honey hives.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.660
Ow! Ow. Ow!

03:14.662 --> 03:17.563
So, they instantly
go into action there.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.232
[bleep] bees, they're meanies.
[bleep]

03:21.802 --> 03:25.204
<i> [tickle] bees really do</i>
<i>  all the work, we just come in</i>
<i>  and rob them.</i>

03:26.473 --> 03:28.874
[sighs] this is
some good stuff right here.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.410
These sunnavabitchs
are madder than wet hens.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.580
-If you calm down--
-well, I was calm,
but I ain't calm now.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.415
-They've been lighting
my ass up.
-Yeah, I know it.

03:36.417 --> 03:40.953
Yet, right now,
you being uncalm
is making the bees uncalm.

03:40.955 --> 03:43.021
<i>  They're like babies,</i>
<i>  however you react,</i>

03:43.023 --> 03:44.423
<i>  that's how they're</i>
<i>  going to react.</i>

03:45.259 --> 03:47.626
Oh yeah, there we go.

03:47.628 --> 03:52.431
You know, most people have
an extractor.
But I do not have one.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.832
[josh] talking about
one of those things
you spin it in?

03:53.834 --> 03:57.402
Yeah, just does it by
centrifugal force.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.138
Spin it for five minutes
and all your honey's out.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.440
[josh] ow! [bleep]

04:01.642 --> 04:03.208
whoo!

04:03.210 --> 04:05.877
-Ow!
-[tickle] he's just taken off
with every tool I need.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.279
God damn!

04:08.282 --> 04:13.085
All right, well,
I'll tell you what,

04:13.087 --> 04:16.655
that right there
ought to give me enough honey
to finish up what we need.

04:16.657 --> 04:19.358
Whoo! Ow!

04:19.360 --> 04:21.360
[tickle]
you're going to have to
pull the stinger out.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.678
-[mark] what you doing?
-I'm just sampling
a little corn whiskey.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.747
-Oh.
-What's good legs look,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.282
look at them good legs
on that liquor.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.083
[cell phone buzzing]

04:46.186 --> 04:47.252
[mark] oh, hell.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.223
[digger] hello.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.759
[killer beaz on phone]
buenos dias.
<i>  How you doing, buddy?</i>

04:53.761 --> 04:57.496
I'm doing wonderful.
Now, you tell me what you need
and I'll tell you beyond that.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.997
[killer beaz laughing]

04:58.999 --> 05:03.001
[mark]
<i>  anytime that killer beaz</i>
<i>  is reaching out to us,</i>

05:03.003 --> 05:04.836
it usually ends up
as a good thing.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.172
But you got to go through
hell and half of georgia

05:07.174 --> 05:08.774
to get to the good thing,
with him.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.276
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  this may be</i>
<i>  an oddball request,</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:13.612
[both] no [bleep],
coming from you.

05:13.614 --> 05:17.616
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  I've got a buddy</i>
<i>  that is looking for</i>

05:17.618 --> 05:21.953
<i>  six gallons</i>
<i>  of straight rye whiskey.</i>

05:22.756 --> 05:25.424
<i>  He told me</i>
<i>  he grew up in canada.</i>

05:25.426 --> 05:26.792
Yeah, they don't have
much corn.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.394
That's their predominant grain
up in canada is rye.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.497
-[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  no barley, no corn--</i>
<i> -no sugar, just all grain.</i>

05:32.499 --> 05:35.867
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  all grain! I don't even know</i>
<i>  if that's possible.</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:39.938
It's possible, yeah,
that's that, good liquors,
they're all grain.

05:39.940 --> 05:44.042
It just takes so much grain,
you know, because you have to
count on the grain producing

05:44.044 --> 05:48.146
all the sugars and starches,
but it's a top notch drink.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.582
This is no surprise right now.
We see a lot of people

05:50.584 --> 05:52.684
that're wanting
specific types of liquor.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.088
This is just
a sign of the times.
People have got money.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.889
And they're going to spend it
on what they want.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.593
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  he doesn't want, just,</i>
<i>  for it to be straight rye,</i>

06:01.595 --> 06:04.062
<i>  he needs it barrel finished.</i>

06:04.531 --> 06:06.898
<i>  Is that the same thing</i>
<i>  as barrel aging?</i>

06:06.900 --> 06:08.934
Barrel finished,
there's no time constraint
on it,

06:08.936 --> 06:10.635
it's just a quick finish.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.704
Barrel finished whiskey
is where you take

06:12.706 --> 06:14.973
a material whiskey,
that's already barrel aged,

06:14.975 --> 06:19.244
you take it out
and put it into another barrel
for additional flavors.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.713
You know this guy
that's buying this, beaz?

06:21.715 --> 06:25.016
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  he was a guitar tech</i>
<i>  back when I was doing</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:27.352
<i>  those projects with the, uh,</i>
<i>  lynyrd skynyrd band.</i>

06:27.354 --> 06:30.389
Beaz did a little touring
with lynyrd skynyrd
back in the day.

06:30.391 --> 06:34.259
<i>  They had a little comedy skit</i>
<i> they ran before their concerts</i>
<i>  and that was beaz.</i>

06:34.261 --> 06:36.928
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  well, what do you think,</i>
<i>  man, is that feasible?</i>

06:36.930 --> 06:40.632
It's something I'd like to do,
beaz. I love any of these
small runs, like this.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.734
This is in digger
and myself's wheelhouse.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.370
<i>  A straight rye</i>
<i>  is something that, uh,</i>

06:45.372 --> 06:47.672
you know, you don't get
a lot of requests for.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.542
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  I didn't tell him</i>
<i> what it was going to cost him,</i>

06:50.544 --> 06:52.978
<i>  I told him it was</i>
<i>  probably expensive.</i>

06:52.980 --> 06:56.615
<i> And he's looking at getting it</i>
<i>  in just a couple of months.</i>

06:56.617 --> 06:58.116
[mark] of course he is.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.853
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  is there a possibility?</i>

07:01.855 --> 07:04.389
Let, yeah,
let us look into
grain prices.

07:04.391 --> 07:07.426
Let us see
what we can do about
rapid aging here,

07:07.428 --> 07:08.860
on a small scale.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.564
You know, beaz aske
for the impossible
but I've got an idea.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.466
I've had this on my mind
for a while,

07:14.468 --> 07:18.270
<i>  it's just not been</i>
<i>  what we could use</i>
<i>  on big runs.</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:21.540
But on this small order
it might be
just what the doctor ordered.

07:21.542 --> 07:26.077
Now, it's going to be pricey,
I mean, I'm not talking
$1,000 a gallon,

07:26.079 --> 07:27.512
but it's still going to be
pretty hefty.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.314
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  okay, very cool.</i>

07:29.316 --> 07:32.217
We're going to go right now,
we're going to start
looking for grain,

07:32.219 --> 07:34.886
but, uh, we'll talk to you
the day after tomorrow,
all right.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.588
[killer beaz on phone]
<i>  all right, guys,</i>
<i>  good to hear your voices.</i>

07:36.590 --> 07:38.089
<i> [mark] yes, it is.</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:49.668
The big day has come,
just going to pack up here,

07:49.670 --> 07:51.970
get some things
organized here.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.974
I'm going to mexico,
because I'm crazy.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.843
It's all howard's fault,
that's why I'm going
to mexico,

07:57.845 --> 07:59.478
it's howard's fault.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.181
Because I met howard at
the mexican restaurant.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.852
I was trying to show him
a ready to drink can,
a ritual,

08:06.854 --> 08:09.688
you know, the can drink
with the sweet
tea and the moonshine.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.490
So, then, howard gets
a daggone margarita

08:11.492 --> 08:13.024
and starts
talking about tequila.

08:13.026 --> 08:17.062
-Oh, look at this right here.
-[waitress]
...Your lime frozen.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.330
Now that's what
I'm cooking with.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.632
[howard] my god!

08:20.667 --> 08:22.467
<i> [tim] I'm telling you,</i>
<i>  that is the bomb.</i>

08:22.469 --> 08:26.371
He got me thinking, you know,
because I'm always thinking,
like, out of the box.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.740
In this business
you've got to be
open minded.

08:28.742 --> 08:33.278
You got to be ready to,
kind of, change
and develop different things.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.314
Over the years,
I've developed all kinds
of recipes,

08:36.316 --> 08:40.585
starting from my base,
that my dad taught me
how to make, climax moonshine.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.688
I don't known nothing
about tequila, other than
it comes from mexico.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.323
That's all I know about it,
so...

08:45.325 --> 08:48.660
Well, I know a guy
that sells tequila,
he's from mexico,

08:48.662 --> 08:51.463
and he told that if I
ever wanted to come to mexico
and learn about tequila,

08:51.465 --> 08:52.664
then just give him a call.

08:52.666 --> 08:56.601
Well, guess what,
I'm going to go
to tequila in mexico.

08:56.603 --> 09:00.405
Tequila, mexico is
where tequila is made.
It's where it was founded.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.908
I, I didn't know
tequila was a place,

09:02.910 --> 09:04.743
I mean, I thought it was
just a drink, really.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.977
I'm, I'm a moonshine guy.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.847
I'm not a tequila guy.
I don't know
anything about tequila.

09:08.849 --> 09:12.951
But, everywhere I go
I'm keep learning more stuff,

09:12.953 --> 09:13.752
you know,
and if you going to be
in the liquor business,

09:13.754 --> 09:15.420
you got to stay open minded.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.923
You got to stay open minded,
you got to be
ready for change.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.226
Somebody's out there's
making something else
all the time.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.428
And that's what tim's
getting ready to do.

09:23.430 --> 09:28.400
Maybe I can make a margarita,
I don't know, but I know
I got a plane to catch.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.102
And the only way
I'm going to catch it
is I've got to get going.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.717
Yeah, I hope the guys will be
happy with this.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.352
I'm thinking they'll be
really happy.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.787
That mash bill's going to be
completely different.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.856
-Totally different.
-Something we can make
a lot of money with.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.391
<i> -[kenny] in a short</i>
<i>  period of time.</i>
<i> -[henry] exactly.</i>

09:53.961 --> 09:54.859
Look yonder.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.396
What've you got
in the bed of that thing?

09:59.433 --> 10:00.999
-[henry laughing]
-[kenny] what do you think?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.902
-[tickle] look at that,
right there!
-[kenny] oh hell, yeah.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.737
What do ya'll think, guys?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.138
Them some pretty cherries,
right there.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.442
These babies
are full of damn juice
and they're sweet.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.243
They're just right.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.847
Henry rolls in and he's got
the prettiest cherries
I have ever seen.

10:15.849 --> 10:16.815
Mmm.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.583
<i>  They're going to make</i>
<i>  some good brandy,</i>

10:18.585 --> 10:21.653
but it's just not
going to make
enough of it.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.788
Only question I got is,
can you get more of these?

10:23.790 --> 10:27.726
We had a whole trailer load
of watermelons
and it filled up one pot.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.561
I love these cherries,
they taste great,

10:29.563 --> 10:31.496
but it don't look like
it's enough of them.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.764
Kenny and I was talking
about it coming on the road,

10:32.766 --> 10:35.400
you know, I'm already set
for that honey wheat.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.168
What about if we mash
the juice out of these

10:37.170 --> 10:38.970
and then if we add
to that mash bill.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.305
Just work it in.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.840
-We'd be getting into
josh's territory then.
-Changes the flavor.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.609
We're basically just changing
the cherry bounce by making it
out of wheat.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.479
Wheat makes it
super smooth and sweet.

10:47.481 --> 10:51.583
It adds a great flavor to it
and it makes a great cap
when you're making your mash.

10:51.585 --> 10:54.886
Look, I, I know
good and well that thing
will smash watermelons,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.221
what you reckon it's
going to do to these cherries?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.657
-[kenny] it'll work them up
good, baby.
-[henry] let's do it.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.258
[tickle] right, we need
the string on top of it.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.961
Yeah, the string can go
in there.

11:02.963 --> 11:06.631
When we first started building
this fruit smasher,
I thought we were wasting

11:06.633 --> 11:09.668
a lot of time
that we could have been
making liquor with.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.970
[kenny] we're going to put
the whole box in at one time.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.973
But, it was worth
every second that it took.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.014
It has saved us so much time.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.084
The amount of time
it would take
to beat in these cherries.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.852
[tickle speaking]

11:27.854 --> 11:28.787
[kenny speaking]

11:28.789 --> 11:31.056
it's something that's,
truly unbelievable.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.426
<i>  We had a real rough start</i>
<i>  to this season,</i>

11:34.428 --> 11:37.495
<i>  but things are starting</i>
<i>  to look up for us.</i>

11:37.497 --> 11:41.499
I have found that
the cleanest job here
is to let josh do it.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.502
<i>  From the past few weeks</i>
<i>  everything's going great</i>

11:44.504 --> 11:48.606
and this wheat, cherry,
honey liquor,
that we're looking at making,

11:48.608 --> 11:50.675
<i> this is really going to put us</i>
<i>  over the top.</i>

11:50.677 --> 11:52.811
[tickle] look, look,
you got to clean up
before we go.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.613
-You can't get in my car
like that.
-All right.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.383
[laughing]
oh my god, he sprayed me!

11:58.885 --> 12:01.386
Man,
looks like I pissed my pants.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.800
<i> [tim] definitely not</i>
<i>  in virginia.</i>

12:15.802 --> 12:18.336
I've been a lot of places,
never seen anything like it.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.476
I see agave plants
around the windows and stuff.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.045
So, there's got to be
some tequila around here.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.782
Well, I came to mexico
to learn as much history
as I can about tequila

12:30.784 --> 12:31.916
and how it's made.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.685
This place is called tequila.

12:33.687 --> 12:34.819
Think about
if it was moonshine,

12:34.821 --> 12:36.955
it'd be
moonshine, virginia, right.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.925
It's educational,
but it's also for
my business side.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.061
Maybe I want to
make moonshine in mexico.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.797
I, maybe I want to bring
tequila back to

12:45.799 --> 12:46.831
the united states
in some fashion.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.133
This is it.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.770
<i>  I'm always looking</i>
<i>  for opportunities.</i>

12:51.772 --> 12:54.405
<i>  Hola, tim, my friend,</i>
<i> welcome home.</i>

12:54.407 --> 12:56.574
-Please, join us.
-Yeah, all right,
I'll come in.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.642
-[jaime] this is home, man.
-[tim laughs]

12:57.644 --> 12:59.744
<i> [tim] I'm meeting up with</i>
<i>  jaime orendain.</i>

12:59.746 --> 13:01.846
I got connected with him
through one of
my distributors.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.015
-[tim] glad to be here.
-[jaime] welcome
to our family house.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.584
This house belongs to us
for more than 100 years.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.654
<i> [tim] he grew up in tequila,</i>
<i> he knows all about the region.</i>

13:09.656 --> 13:11.456
I mean, this is where
tequila came from.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.824
[jaime] this is
our center patio.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.093
-[tim] this is different,
this is different for me.
-[jaime] yes!

13:15.095 --> 13:17.562
And that's the house,
but now we're outside again.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.430
[both laughing]

13:19.432 --> 13:20.865
-[jaime] tequila is my,
my town.
-Yeah.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.767
-[jaime] I have a lot of
remembers here, uh,
-okay.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.837
[jaime] you know, when I was
a kid, with my grandfather
and my grandmother.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.605
Yeah, I, I see that
it's called tequila.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.474
Is that why tequila is here?

13:29.476 --> 13:33.645
Yes, the name came from the,
the city and then the,
the liquid.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.981
You know,
the reason the most important
distilleries are in tequila

13:36.983 --> 13:38.016
is because you have
very good water.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.384
-Uh-huh.
-You know,
the tequila mountain

13:39.386 --> 13:40.652
used to be a volcano.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.954
And the water
that we have here
came underground,

13:42.956 --> 13:45.590
you know, very good water,
very high quality water.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.825
-It's, kind of,
like moonshining.
-Oh.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.459
We got to have
that good water, you know,

13:48.461 --> 13:49.994
we always looking for
the right spot.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.863
-We need that, the best water.
That's the reason we are here.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.967
Yes, but directly my family,
since 1924,

13:55.969 --> 13:59.470
we start making tequila
with, uh, our family name.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.840
-Let me show you, please.
-Okay.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.609
-This is, uh, don eduardo,
my grandfather.
-[tim] mmm-hmm.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.411
[jaime] and mercedes,
my grandmother.

14:06.413 --> 14:10.014
So, your grandfather,
he was the beginning
of this business?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.850
Yes and he was my teacher.
He told me,

14:11.852 --> 14:14.352
"you want to be
in this business, you have to
learn every single step."

14:14.354 --> 14:15.520
[tim] everything.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.223
-I'm the third generation
and I have four kids.
-Uh-huh.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.759
And they know
how to produce tequila
because I teach them

14:21.761 --> 14:22.894
[tim] everything, just like
your father taught you.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.730
-Yes, we have tequila
in our blood.
-Yeah.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.999
Jaime and I,
we have a whole lot in common.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.535
He's a third generation
distiller, just like I am.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.936
Was it illegal?

14:31.938 --> 14:34.005
-At the beginning,
that was illegal.
-Yeah.

14:34.007 --> 14:34.672
-You know?
-Uh-huh.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.909
[jaime speaking]

14:37.911 --> 14:41.746
-[tim] mmm-hmm.
-[jaime speaking]

14:41.748 --> 14:45.116
[jaime speaking]

14:46.887 --> 14:50.989
<i> [narrator] the history</i>
<i>  of using the agave plant</i>
<i>  to produce alcohol</i>

14:50.991 --> 14:55.193
<i>  dates back to at least</i>
<i>  1,000 b.C. To</i>
<i>  the ancient olmecs.</i>

14:55.195 --> 15:01.532
<i>  And, later, to the aztecs,</i>
<i>  who fermented agave sap</i>
<i>  into a wine called pulque.</i>

15:01.534 --> 15:07.372
<i>  During the spanish invasion</i>
<i>  of the aztec empire,</i>
<i>  in the early 1500s,</i>

15:07.374 --> 15:11.309
<i>  the conquistadors</i>
<i>  ran out of brandy</i>
<i>  and began distilling</i>

15:11.311 --> 15:16.314
<i>  the aztec pulque into</i>
<i>  an early predecessor</i>
<i>  of tequila called mezcal.</i>

15:16.316 --> 15:20.752
<i>  Popularity of</i>
<i>  the agave-based liquor</i>
<i>  grew through the 1500s.</i>

15:20.754 --> 15:27.425
<i>  Then, in 1600, the first</i>
<i>  large-scale distillery,</i>
<i>  named hacienda cuisillos,</i>

15:27.427 --> 15:30.395
<i>  was established</i>
<i>  in the town of</i>
<i>  santiago de tequila,</i>

15:30.397 --> 15:34.399
<i>  in what is now</i>
<i>  the state of jalisco, mexico.</i>

15:34.401 --> 15:40.571
<i>  By 1893, the town was renamed</i>
<i>  tequila and the distinct</i>
<i>  mezcal de tequila,</i>

15:40.573 --> 15:42.674
<i>  made from</i>
<i>  the local blue agave,</i>

15:42.676 --> 15:45.643
<i>  became known, simply,</i>
<i>  as tequila.</i>

15:45.645 --> 15:48.513
<i>  In 1994,</i>
<i>  the mexican government</i>

15:48.515 --> 15:52.216
<i>  made the mezcal tequila</i>
<i>  classification official.</i>

15:52.218 --> 15:56.054
<i>  Establishing two, separate,</i>
<i>  denominations of origin.</i>

15:56.056 --> 15:59.457
<i>  Tequila, which is,</i>
<i> technically, a type of mezcal,</i>

15:59.459 --> 16:01.893
<i>  can only be produced</i>
<i>  from blue agave.</i>

16:01.895 --> 16:07.398
<i>  While mezcal producers</i>
<i>  choose from about 30 of</i>
<i>  the more than 270 varieties</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:10.234
<i> of agave, that grow in mexico.</i>

16:13.506 --> 16:15.740
So should we get
on the sidewalk,
or just walk down the road?

16:15.742 --> 16:18.176
-[jaime] it's our town, man,
remember.
-Yeah.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.411
I guess I am walking with
mr. Tequila.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.347
[both laughing]

16:23.783 --> 16:26.217
and this is the city,
the city hall.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.521
And this is, uh,
the whole history
of, uh, of the town.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.391
-You see the fields,
the agave plantation?
-[tim] uh-huh.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.661
-[jaime] and the volcano,
this is the tequila volcano.
-[tim] ah.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.896
-[jaime] my grandfather,
don eduardo, is there.
-Uh-huh.

16:38.898 --> 16:42.233
Well, you know,
my dad and his brothers,
also pictured in city hall...

16:42.235 --> 16:43.601
-Oh, really?
-...In my hometown.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.037
-Ah, congratulations. Great.
-[tim] yeah,
but as a wanted poster.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.806
It's because they was
convicted of
illegal making moonshine.

16:48.808 --> 16:49.807
[laughing] oh, my god.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.876
-Yeah.
-Ah, but this is
another kind of picture.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.712
-[tim] yeah, yeah, this is,
like, in honor of you.
-Yes.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.481
I'm a little bit jealous here.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.550
They're honoring
jaime's grandfather,
but, you know, back home

16:59.552 --> 17:02.220
they looking at my father as,
maybe, a criminal.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.090
-[jaime] in mexico,
you can make tequila.
-[tim] mmm-hmm.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.793
-[jaime] but only in
five states.
-[tim] okay.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.928
-In jalisco,
there is michoacan,
-uh-huh.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.163
There is nayarit,

17:12.832 --> 17:14.032
there is guanajuato,

17:14.034 --> 17:14.899
and tamaulipas.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.902
-But we are here, in tequila,
-mmm-hmm.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.405
The heart of the production
of the tequila.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.407
<i> [tim] hey, I've come</i>
<i>  a long way to see every step</i>

17:22.409 --> 17:23.908
<i>  in the process</i>
<i>  of making tequila.</i>

17:23.910 --> 17:25.810
I'm really excited
to get in this distillery

17:25.812 --> 17:28.012
and see how
they make this stuff.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.048
<i> [jaime] and we produce here,</i>
<i>  tequila verde.</i>

17:30.750 --> 17:32.216
Welcome.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.862
[digger] you going to get you
a bite out of them mushrooms,
right there,

17:44.864 --> 17:47.131
-before we go any further?
-[mark] no,
I'm afraid of them mushrooms.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.599
[digger] well,
them's a pretty color though.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.202
[mark] yeah,
you'd probably see
pretty colors, too.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.703
I'm looking forward
to doing this little run.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.606
Yeah, I like these small runs,
they're way more easier.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.410
We got this order from beaz
for 100% rye whiskey

17:59.412 --> 18:02.413
<i> and he just wants six gallons,</i>
<i>  so I feel good about it.</i>

18:02.415 --> 18:05.616
It's been a long time
since we ran this much rye,
in any recipe.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.653
-God damn, I'm hurting, boss.
-Yeah.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.855
Yep, never heard me say
that much, do you?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.423
Not with any
credible witnesses.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.125
[both laughing]

18:15.795 --> 18:17.829
for this particular type
of whiskey,

18:17.831 --> 18:21.532
<i>  you have to bring</i>
<i>  your water up</i>
<i>  to a hard boil.</i>

18:21.534 --> 18:23.968
Hey, boy,
we're rolling pretty decent.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.636
-What do you think, flame out?
-Yeah.

18:25.638 --> 18:29.407
We cannot, under no means,
permit fire

18:29.409 --> 18:32.176
<i>  to be under this pot</i>
<i>  once the grain goes in it.</i>

18:32.178 --> 18:34.745
It gels up really quick
and we don't want
any grain in it

18:34.747 --> 18:36.547
to have the opportunity to,
to scorch.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.416
[mark] don't forget
your rye malt.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.654
Digger is wanting to use
a little bit of rye malt,

18:43.656 --> 18:44.822
a little bit
for extra measure.

18:44.824 --> 18:48.559
To just,
adjust the flavor profile
a little bit.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.795
The rye malt will give it
more of a earthy note

18:50.797 --> 18:52.897
than the peppery notes
you notice from rye.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.967
That's just simply because
it's sprouted.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.802
<i>  That little bit</i>
<i>  of growth in there</i>

18:57.804 --> 19:00.972
<i>  gives it a whole different</i>
<i>  flavor profile.</i>

19:02.208 --> 19:04.942
This mash is thick as
concrete setting up.

19:04.944 --> 19:09.046
<i> But, once it gets cool enough,</i>
<i>  that's when you use</i>
<i>  your amylase enzyme</i>

19:09.048 --> 19:11.382
<i>  and that breaks down</i>
<i>  the long-chain sugars.</i>

19:11.384 --> 19:14.018
Within minutes,
it'll turn back
to liquid mash.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.788
All the solids will settle
at the bottom, and, um,
we're ready to go.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.223
[mark] oh, hell!

19:19.225 --> 19:22.627
I don't know
if we can read this.

19:22.629 --> 19:26.797
The thermometer has a lot of
condensation in it,
you can barely see the needle,

19:26.799 --> 19:29.567
and you can't see
the numbers at all.

19:29.569 --> 19:33.037
[digger] let me see
if we can blow that water
out of there.

19:33.039 --> 19:37.975
It's very critical,
this temperature has got to be
between 150 and 160 degrees

19:37.977 --> 19:41.812
<i>  when you pitch that</i>
<i>  amylase enzyme.</i>
<i>  If it's too hot, it kills it.</i>

19:41.814 --> 19:43.447
If it's too cold,
it don't work.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.917
[digger] I don't believe you
done no count.

19:45.919 --> 19:49.987
It never, ever,
entered my mind
to put open flame

19:49.989 --> 19:53.991
to your thermometer,
especially the gauge part
of it, the face of it,

19:53.993 --> 19:55.760
with the glass and the needle
and the numbers.

19:55.762 --> 19:59.263
But, obviously, you know,
it entered digger's mind.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.300
[digger] that's good enough,
we can see it.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.769
I believe we're, about,
where we need to be.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.838
The temperature's
not really easy to see,
but, you know,

20:07.840 --> 20:10.741
<i>  I can tell we're bumping</i>
<i>  right at 160</i>

20:10.743 --> 20:12.810
and as it looks right now,
we're doing all right.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.446
I'm going to start
laying the amylase to it.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.948
[digger] get ready to stir,
buddy.

20:16.950 --> 20:20.685
You can't overuse amylase,
I don't care
what anybody says.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.786
[mark] it don't change
your flavor.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.922
No flavor imparted,
whatsoever.

20:24.924 --> 20:29.260
<i> [digger] amylase enzyme</i>
<i>  is in insect saliva,</i>
<i>  it's in our saliva.</i>

20:29.262 --> 20:30.962
In essence,
what that enzyme is doing,

20:30.964 --> 20:35.066
it's taking the long-chain,
polysaccharide sugars
and breaking them down to

20:35.068 --> 20:37.802
single-chain,
monosaccharide sugars,
which the yeast can work on

20:37.804 --> 20:41.072
more readily to convert
and make into alcohol.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.274
[digger] did it loosen up
down at the bottom
a little bit?

20:43.343 --> 20:44.976
Yeah. [grunts]

20:46.946 --> 20:51.449
yeah, I don't know
if we got it too cool,
or it's still too hot.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.351
[digger] you're not going
to tell by looking at it.

20:55.788 --> 20:59.156
Let's let that sit there
for just a second
and see what it does.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.659
Damn if you ain't made
a bowl of thickening.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.395
[mark] I mean,
is it done went too cool?

21:04.397 --> 21:08.666
[digger] we either had
bad amylase, pitched it
too hot or too cool.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.969
I don't know, we can't,
necessarily,
trust that thermometer,

21:11.971 --> 21:14.038
since you've burned it up
with the torch.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.641
It's a thermometer.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.877
It's sitting this close to
a damn propane flame.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.012
-Yeah.
-Maybe that's what did it.

21:21.014 --> 21:24.415
This, this close ain't stuck
right on the damn thing.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.549
I was just fanning it,
I wasn't,

21:25.551 --> 21:28.386
I didn't hold it on it
like I was trying to melt it.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.523
[mark] we can't
heat it back up,
it'll scorch it immediately.

21:32.525 --> 21:36.394
-We can't get enough liquid
out of it at this stage.
-[digger] uh-uh.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.696
Let's dump it.
We'll, we'll make
a whole 'nother run.

21:38.698 --> 21:41.565
Mash this thick
that we have to strain off,

21:41.567 --> 21:43.901
<i>  you, you'll get nothing</i>
<i>  out of this, I mean,</i>

21:43.903 --> 21:45.469
<i>  you might get</i>
<i>  a pint of liquor</i>
<i>  out of all this.</i>

21:45.471 --> 21:47.338
We can't waste any more time.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.807
We're going to build
a whole 'nother mash,
we got plenty of grain,

21:49.809 --> 21:52.877
you know, we're not going to
sacrifice the quality
of this liquor.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.046
<i>  We've got to get it done</i>
<i>  so we can concentrate on</i>

21:55.048 --> 21:57.481
how we're going to quickly
barrel finish this liquor.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.116
And we're a day behind, so...

21:59.118 --> 22:01.385
-[digger] we're right on time.
-We're right on time.

22:10.096 --> 22:10.728
Let's get some work done.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.129
All right.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.832
We got everything
to damn mash in with,

22:14.834 --> 22:17.234
<i>  everybody's here,</i>
<i>  brian's done showed up.</i>

22:17.236 --> 22:19.970
We got the stills,
we got the skills

22:19.972 --> 22:22.406
<i>  and we're going to mash in</i>
<i>  some good cherry,</i>
<i>  honey, wheat.</i>

22:22.408 --> 22:24.141
[grunting]

22:25.411 --> 22:27.411
man, that's a lot
of cherry juice.

22:27.413 --> 22:31.549
[tickle] hard seltzer
is extremely good
for making a lot of money.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.819
But, now people are
buying liquor and we really
don't want to miss the boat.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.687
We want them to be buying
our liquor.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.522
-[brian] what's this
right here?
-[tickle] it's honey.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.324
-[kenny] damn, that's a lot
of honey, ain't it.
-Two, four, five...

22:40.326 --> 22:42.793
It's going to be
a very high-end product

22:42.795 --> 22:44.795
<i>  and now that people</i>
<i>  are interested in</i>
<i>  spending money</i>

22:44.797 --> 22:45.863
[exclaims] oh, yeah.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.598
We're fixing
to flood the market

22:47.600 --> 22:49.066
with some of the best
<i>  honey, wheat, cherry</i>

22:49.068 --> 22:51.635
<i>  you've ever seen</i>
<i>  in your life.</i>

22:51.637 --> 22:52.937
Probably the only.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.605
[kenny speaking indistinctly]

22:54.607 --> 22:55.873
first I got to boil
this water.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.709
Once I bring it to the boil
then we'll cook
that meal in.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.246
Once it cooks for an hour,
then we'll add
the wheat bran, honey,

23:02.248 --> 23:04.014
then we'll add the cherries.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.283
[gas whooshing]

23:10.390 --> 23:11.355
[tickle] all right.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.657
There we go.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.827
There's eight pots out here,
there's a process to this.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.963
It's getting hot,
we're ready to
cook it in, boys.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.331
We start at the first pot.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.766
[henry] corn.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.368
<i> [tickle] that's got to cook</i>
<i>  for an hour.</i>

23:24.370 --> 23:27.738
So, as that's doing that,
we move down to the next pot,

23:27.740 --> 23:29.540
<i>  start heating that one up,</i>
<i>  getting our grain in.</i>

23:29.542 --> 23:32.743
Getting our grain in
and keep moving down the line.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.579
<i>  Once we get all eight</i>
<i>  of these pots heated up</i>

23:35.581 --> 23:37.648
<i>  and grain in there cooking,</i>

23:37.650 --> 23:40.684
then we move right back up
to the first pot again.

23:40.686 --> 23:43.154
Hey, brian, brian,
you bring the water?

23:43.156 --> 23:44.688
Cooked for an hour now.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.824
Now we're gonna start putting
some water in
and cool it down a little bit,

23:46.826 --> 23:49.794
once it cools down just a tad,
then we're gonna
start throwing sugar to it.

23:49.796 --> 23:53.063
Throw the cherries to it,
we'll throw the honey to it

23:53.065 --> 23:56.167
and then we'll throw
some wheat bran in here

23:56.169 --> 23:57.368
and we'll have our mash bill.

23:57.703 --> 23:58.969
Oh, yeah.

23:58.971 --> 24:02.807
A year ago,
won't know anybody could
afford anything high end.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.409
Yo, kenny, brian,
ya'll wanna bring us a bucket
of cherry juice?

24:05.411 --> 24:06.577
That's good stuff, man.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.213
Right now this is the
perfect environment

24:09.215 --> 24:12.316
<i>  to make a real,</i>
<i>  top-shelf liquor.</i>

24:12.351 --> 24:13.818
All right.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.087
-Lot of suffering
in that bucket.
-[tickle] you got that right.

24:20.493 --> 24:23.093
It's good stuff
right there, fellas.

24:26.466 --> 24:31.101
Once we get all eight of these
pots mashed in with high
quality ingredients.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.636
-You ever use
wheat bran before?
-[josh] no.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.838
We use it all the time.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.373
-Look like oatmeal, don't it?
-Tastes like raisin bran.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.741
<i>  It's gonna</i>
<i>  be something different.</i>

24:37.743 --> 24:42.213
I can really see how
we can bump our price
up on this and get it.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.614
-All right.
-We need that yeast.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.715
There you go.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.952
I tell you what,
it's fixing to be pay day.

24:50.823 --> 24:54.124
-There you go. All right.
-[henry] cover them on up.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.593
-Well, seven more.
-Thank you, buddy.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.094
-That--
-[shushes]

24:57.096 --> 24:59.363
-what?
-Can you hold just one minute
without talking?

25:00.967 --> 25:02.733
Oh, that's my baby.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.536
-Gonna make some money, baby.
-Wait a minute, he's throwing
his charm on it.

25:05.538 --> 25:06.804
Throwing his charm on it?

25:06.806 --> 25:10.140
Oh, yeah.
Let's roll, there's
seven more to go.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.310
-[all laughing]
-[tickle] what the hell
was that?

25:13.312 --> 25:16.013
[all laughing]

25:28.895 --> 25:30.160
uh-huh.

25:30.463 --> 25:32.763
There are different techniques
in distilling
around the world.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.366
<i>  So if I can learn</i>
<i>  even a simple technique,</i>

25:35.368 --> 25:38.569
<i> maybe I can use that to better</i>
<i>  myself as a distiller.</i>

25:38.571 --> 25:42.006
Maybe I can bring that back
home and I can enhance
my technique

25:42.008 --> 25:43.474
and maybe I can make
something special.

25:49.415 --> 25:53.083
<i> [tim] you know, he's got</i>
<i>  a 40-ton oven they use</i>
<i>  to steam their agave.</i>

25:54.353 --> 25:55.719
[tim] yeah.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.756
-We take that rocks
and we put it there.
-Is that really strong?

25:58.758 --> 26:02.293
Strong and they
have a temperature control.

26:02.295 --> 26:05.162
-[tim] how long
does this take? Okay.
-40 hours.

26:08.501 --> 26:09.733
[tim] I see.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.336
-So we got the juice,
we send them to these tanks.
-Yeah.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.441
-Six days?
-Six days.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.876
Uh-huh.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.711
-I do open fermentation too.
-Yeah, me too.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.947
-You know,
you have a lot of flavors.
-Yeah. Yeah.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.515
-And you know
from the air it is...
-Yeah.

26:24.517 --> 26:28.419
Because where it's made at,
it goes into the flavor.

26:28.421 --> 26:31.722
There are a lot
of similarities in making
moonshine and making tequila.

26:31.724 --> 26:35.693
<i>  We've made moonshine in</i>
<i> different parts of the country</i>
<i>  in the united states</i>

26:35.695 --> 26:39.597
and that region actually
gives a taste profile
to that product.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.365
-Fermentation is ready.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.667
We send into
the distillation area.

26:43.669 --> 26:46.170
We have
a double distillation,
we have pot stills.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.438
[tim] oh, look at that.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.310
Oh, okay.

27:06.492 --> 27:08.192
-Just like moonshine.
-Yes.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.727
But there is a couple
of different types of tequila.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.195
Okay.

27:16.636 --> 27:20.237
To be reposado,
at least have
to be two months in wood.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.539
For anejo,
have to be in a barrel.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.141
-All right.
-At least one year.

27:24.143 --> 27:28.178
And for extra anejo,
no less than three years.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.848
-So you got to categorize.
What falls into it.
-Yes, we have to categorize.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.783
Let me show you the warehouse
and I have a surprise for you.

27:32.785 --> 27:35.386
-You got a surprise?
-Yes.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.755
The more time I spend
with jaime,
the more I respect him

27:37.757 --> 27:39.523
and the more
I like him actually.

27:39.525 --> 27:42.793
<i>  Tequila's in his blood</i>
<i> like moonshine is in my blood.</i>

27:42.795 --> 27:45.663
Hey, I know when I find
someone who's a real deal

27:45.665 --> 27:46.797
and jaime is a real deal.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.966
This is a very special place.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.635
-You know, we age
our tequila in this area.
-Oh, I'm seeing.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.571
In this section
we have the new batch
of the barrels

27:54.573 --> 27:56.907
and this section we have
the very old barrels.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.842
All the barrels we use
came from kentucky.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.879
We buy used barrel for bourbon
and we bring them here.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.681
But today, we're gonna
do a very special thing.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.716
We're gonna open this barrel.

28:05.718 --> 28:06.684
-Okay.
-It's a very old barrel
that we used.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.119
More than 25 years.

28:09.121 --> 28:13.157
The last batch that
we're gonna use in this barrel
is gonna be today.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.759
We're gonna check the proof,
and we're gonna taste.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.661
<i> [tim] hey, I'm excited.</i>
<i>  You know, jaime's telling me,</i>

28:17.663 --> 28:19.730
<i>  "we're gonna pull out</i>
<i>  a sample of it,</i>

28:19.732 --> 28:22.099
we're gonna check the proof
of it and actually taste it."

28:22.735 --> 28:25.069
and then I'm gonna
take the tequila.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.973
-Now please.
-Okay, I'm doing
the same thing.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.047
-Oops.
-I lost 100 dollars' worth,
didn't I?

28:37.049 --> 28:38.716
I might have to work a day
to get it back.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.517
[laughs]

28:40.519 --> 28:43.020
jaime takes the sample
of tequila,

28:43.022 --> 28:44.221
<i>  and we're checking</i>
<i>  the proof of it.</i>

28:48.127 --> 28:49.126
Okay.

28:52.765 --> 28:53.530
[tim] okay.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.232
This is the density
that we use.

28:56.836 --> 28:59.970
-And the temperature.
We'll put it inside.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:01.807 --> 29:04.074
-53.
-And then temperature...

29:04.643 --> 29:06.043
-24?
-24.

29:06.045 --> 29:09.813
-53 and 24 temperature.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:09.815 --> 29:11.882
51.5% alcohol.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.985
-A 103 proof, then?
-Yeah, a 103 proof, yes.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.554
-That's the temperature
conversion?
-Yes.

29:17.556 --> 29:20.424
This chart that we're using
explains what you need to do.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.960
It's a little high
and before we bottle it,

29:22.962 --> 29:24.561
-we have to add water.
-Okay.

29:24.563 --> 29:28.499
Whether you need to raise
the proof or lower the proof
to get the correct number.

29:28.501 --> 29:31.301
-And you feel the aromas
from the booze.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.871
-The vanilla?
-I'm getting
that bourbon smell.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.839
That came from the barrel.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.040
-That smells really good.
-Yes.

29:37.042 --> 29:37.875
It tastes better.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.544
I've been waiting
all day for this.

29:40.546 --> 29:43.781
And I'm very proud to drink
tequila with you, tim

29:43.783 --> 29:44.948
I'm proud to be here,
it's an honor.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.017
Drinking tequila in tequila.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.986
It don't get no better
than that.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.591
That tastes just as good
as it smells.

29:54.593 --> 29:58.128
-And I can taste all the
traditions you put in this.
-Yes.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.565
-And the passion.
We make tequila with heart
-very, very good.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.400
And with my soul.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.769
<i> [tim] you know, I've tasted</i>
<i>  a few tequilas in my lifetime</i>

30:05.771 --> 30:08.238
and this tequila
was off the chain.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.407
So, I think I'm on
the right track here.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.776
You know, I came to mexico
to learn about tequila,

30:12.778 --> 30:16.780
and I see that I'm tasting
the best tequila
that I've ever tasted.

30:16.782 --> 30:20.584
But I'd really love to see
where the agave plant grows.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.954
-I gotta get it all of it.
-We can ride to the fields

30:23.956 --> 30:25.789
-to see the agave plantations.
-I wanna see it.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.725
-Tomorrow morning. Yes.
-In the morning?

30:28.727 --> 30:30.994
-Not now? Okay, we're gonna
drink too much.
<i>  -Salud.</i>

30:38.804 --> 30:41.939
-We gonna try this again,
ain't we?
-Yeah, we is.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.640
There's a lot riding
on this run.

30:43.642 --> 30:46.743
It may turn out something
really good for us
in the future.

30:46.745 --> 30:49.546
Well, you know it kind
of feels like groundhog day.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.315
<i>  First mash didn't work.</i>

30:51.317 --> 30:52.583
<i>  We missed</i>
<i>  our temperature mark</i>

30:52.585 --> 30:55.919
or the amylase enzyme
didn't do what
it was supposed to do.

30:55.921 --> 30:59.756
But we're gonna remash today.
We've gotta skin
this cat all over again.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.925
-Look here.
-Look there.

31:01.927 --> 31:05.629
-What did you find?
-I got my barbecue
thermometer.

31:05.631 --> 31:09.333
I brought a little, digital
on my smoker.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.101
We're gonna get
it right this time.

31:11.103 --> 31:14.771
-You mean, you don't wanna
clear this one up?
-I can't see it.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.106
If you'd have put
the sunnavabitch up,

31:16.108 --> 31:19.276
it wouldn't have got like that
you left it out
in the weather.

31:19.278 --> 31:22.412
Yeah and that blow torch
didn't have nothing
to do with it.

31:22.414 --> 31:23.914
It's all the weather.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.550
Weather's what's caused
what the blow torch
was trying to fix.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.951
Of course it did.

31:27.953 --> 31:31.088
There will be another reaction
to an action,
always remember that.

31:31.090 --> 31:34.958
Maybe somebody will pay more
attention to taking care
of equipment.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.393
I don't know.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.763
Damn, I hate watching
water boil.

31:39.765 --> 31:41.965
Let's see what
we got here, puss.

31:41.967 --> 31:45.369
-Oh, yes.
-Standard old rye going
in some of that red rye.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.938
All that goodie.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.806
We may have put
too much grain yesterday.

31:49.808 --> 31:52.042
I think that was
our biggest issue.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.411
Other than it
being way too cold.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.416
Let's start putting it
in there.
I'm gonna turn the fire on.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.450
All right.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.185
We'll get
the water a churning.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.290
-Ready?
-Yeah, boy.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.394
Seems like
we just done this.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.029
[digger] well,
it smells pretty.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.398
I'm gonna dump a little
of that rye malt in there.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.969
That ought to be plenty.

32:21.907 --> 32:24.808
-We're at 158.
-Put it in there, puss.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.410
To use this amylase,

32:26.412 --> 32:30.380
<i>  long as your between</i>
<i>  155 and 160,</i>
<i>  that's your sweet spot.</i>

32:30.382 --> 32:31.848
But I like to hit right
in the middle of it.

32:31.850 --> 32:35.218
<i>  You get a whole lot better</i>
<i>  conversion on your starches.</i>

32:35.921 --> 32:37.554
If this don't work
then to hell with it.

32:37.556 --> 32:41.191
-We go buy him some rye.
-[laughs] yeah.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.760
-That oughta do it
right there.
-Oh, yeah, look yonder, puss.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.929
That's what you're
supposed to do, right there.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.831
Now you hit the nail perfect.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.299
It's liquefying immediately.

32:49.301 --> 32:49.833
Yeah, boy.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.068
Churn them sugars up.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.738
Yesterday's buffet was oatmeal
and today we got oatmeal soup.

32:54.740 --> 32:55.639
That's rye meal soup.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.674
Well, it looked like oatmeal.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.410
-We still have
to strain this out of there.
-Oh, yeah.

33:00.412 --> 33:01.812
Just breaks them sugars down.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.780
Cuts it up.
[blows raspberry]

33:03.782 --> 33:05.916
I believe we got mission
accomplished right here.

33:05.918 --> 33:07.551
Are you gonna pitch the yeast?

33:07.553 --> 33:10.220
Oh, let's wait
until we get it in the barrel.

33:14.293 --> 33:18.829
-Reminds you of slopping hogs.
-That's exactly what's going
through my mind.

33:18.831 --> 33:22.599
This is an all-grain recipe
that was requested
by the client.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.802
-You good there?
-I'm almost good.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.572
<i>  So, we can't deviate</i>
<i>  from that, we've got to run</i>
<i>  what he wants,</i>

33:28.574 --> 33:30.240
we're not gonna add any sugar.

33:30.242 --> 33:33.043
A sophisticated palate
can taste the sugar liquor
in there.

33:34.747 --> 33:37.914
To say I'm excited
about this
little run of whiskey,

33:37.916 --> 33:38.548
that'd be an understatement.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.783
Good.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.652
There's nothing in the world
better than all grain liquor.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.122
<i>  ♪ rye whiskey, rye whiskey ♪</i>

33:45.124 --> 33:47.357
-you should have
been a singer.
-I know.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.036
All right.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.637
This thing is beautiful, josh,
I'm telling you man.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.973
Beautiful caps.

34:02.975 --> 34:05.475
Look how they're made.
You bend this metal over
right here

34:05.477 --> 34:08.011
and it makes it
much more stronger.

34:08.013 --> 34:10.013
You can never find a cap
any prettier than that
right there.

34:10.015 --> 34:11.314
Josh, I want this cap.

34:11.316 --> 34:12.682
Thank you, buddy.
I appreciate that.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.786
My favorite cap's
one that's got liquor
pumping through it.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.687
Well, they're gonna have
liquor pumping through 'em.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.389
Smells good.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.926
Today is the day we're gonna
run some cherry, honey wheat.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.094
Sure is better.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.695
Yeah, that mash is
good and strong,
she's ready to roll.

34:25.697 --> 34:29.032
We've got all eight of these
stills mashed in.

34:29.034 --> 34:34.204
And it has finally come time
to get this operation
in full swing.

34:35.874 --> 34:37.741
Normally we work
from the center.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.577
But in this case here,
we've got one pump that's
gonna be on this side,

34:40.579 --> 34:41.945
another pump's gonna
be on the other side.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.648
So, we're gonna run those two
into this one pump,

34:44.650 --> 34:46.783
we're gonna run these two
into this one pump.

34:46.785 --> 34:51.188
Every pipe is cut to match,
so when the baby
starts boiling,

34:51.190 --> 34:52.389
-we gotta be ready.
-Ready to go.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.424
All right.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.393
-You got a piece of paper
or do you want me to light it?
-No, sir. I got it.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.262
All right, ready to roll.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.766
All right.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.742
-How's it feel, kenny,
good slick?
-Good slick.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.611
-How's it feel, josh,
good slick?
-Yeah.

35:14.613 --> 35:19.683
It's getting good and hot,
man, it ain't gonna be just
a few minutes here.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.818
When you're running
submarine stills, you gotta
keep that baby stirring

35:21.820 --> 35:22.853
till it starts boiling.

35:25.023 --> 35:26.490
<i>  That way we make sure</i>
<i>  it doesn't burn at all.</i>

35:26.492 --> 35:29.392
When it starts boiling where
that submarine still is made,

35:29.394 --> 35:33.263
it will follow the contour
of that still,
just like an oval shape.

35:34.066 --> 35:35.699
I got some steam coming
off this thing.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.334
That's just our heads.

35:37.336 --> 35:41.438
That stuff boils off about
a somewhere around 145 degrees

35:41.440 --> 35:45.108
<i>  and we'll let them</i>
<i>  heads boil off before</i>
<i>  we cap these things.</i>

35:45.110 --> 35:46.676
And it won't be in no time
after we cap it

35:46.678 --> 35:49.146
that we'll have liquor
pouring out this thing.

35:49.148 --> 35:52.849
Damn, if I ain't ready,
I'm gonna let it run off
when we're ready.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.151
-Mine is boiling over here.
-You gonna cap it?

35:54.153 --> 35:55.418
Yeah, just cap it.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.988
A little paste.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.626
That's good.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.661
Won't be long,
we'll be making some liquor.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.463
This has been
a long time coming.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.765
Here, josh,
wrap that along right there.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.868
<i>  You know, we've had all eight</i>
<i>  of these pots up before,</i>

36:11.870 --> 36:16.606
but finally we're gonna run
to full capacity.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.341
It's getting hot already
going over in that.

36:18.343 --> 36:22.646
We've got 4,800 gallons
of mash.

36:22.648 --> 36:27.017
<i>  Most moonshiners don't see</i>
<i>  that much mash in five years.</i>

36:27.019 --> 36:29.386
We're running this in one day.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.354
Good and it sounds good.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.135
[tim] this is like a circus.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.837
I ain't never seen
such a thing.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.806
Breaking my neck
looking at it.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.175
-They're wrapping
the rope around.
-Yes.

36:52.177 --> 36:54.411
What happens
if the rope gets tangled?

36:54.413 --> 36:56.046
I don't know.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.714
Maybe that's
why they have extra,
in case one dies.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.150
[jaime laughs] oh, my god.

37:00.152 --> 37:03.119
Who in the world ever came
up with such a thing?

37:04.256 --> 37:06.656
I guess they gonna spin,
so it has to unwind.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.358
Yes, at the same time.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.295
-The weight of the guys
have to be similar.
-Same time.

37:12.297 --> 37:15.098
-He's whistling and playing
at the same time.
-[jaime] the same time.

37:15.801 --> 37:16.866
<i> Now that's what you call loco.</i>

37:16.868 --> 37:18.602
<i> Yes, they are locos.</i>

37:18.604 --> 37:22.405
It's amazing. It's mexico.
The tradition.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.811
-[tim] okay, maybe they had
too much tequila.
-Yes.

37:27.813 --> 37:28.812
Or maybe they need
some tequila.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.114
Maybe they need tequila
after this, tim.

37:31.116 --> 37:33.383
[tim] I need some tequila
just watching them.

37:35.988 --> 37:37.487
Good and sounds good.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.389
Hey, can I talk
to ya'll for a second?

37:39.391 --> 37:41.725
So now that we've got
the first four stills
capped off,

37:41.727 --> 37:44.961
while we wait, I got something
I want to talk to
the guys about.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.564
-[henry] what's the problem,
man?
-I'm just a little frustrated.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.566
What's it going
and what's your problem?

37:49.568 --> 37:50.967
I don't really wanna
say nothing, but...

37:50.969 --> 37:53.703
Me and my woman's
having some issues.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.740
And technically,
I'm homeless right now.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.142
It ain't like I can't go stay
in a motel

37:59.144 --> 38:00.644
or I can't go crash
at my friend's.

38:00.646 --> 38:03.647
It's just the fact
I don't have anywhere
of my own to land in

38:03.649 --> 38:05.782
and I've got trucks
and bikes and tools.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.351
It cost a fortune
to rent a place

38:08.353 --> 38:10.987
and you gotta have all these
credentials, you know,

38:10.989 --> 38:15.625
you gotta have all this
paperwork and stuff
and long story short,

38:15.627 --> 38:18.028
I'm not exactly homeless
but I'm kind of homeless,

38:18.030 --> 38:19.629
I don't really have
a home to go to.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.864
I tell you what.

38:20.866 --> 38:24.534
I got a two-story house,
100 acres of land, big pond,

38:24.536 --> 38:25.935
you need somewhere
to move in to,

38:25.937 --> 38:29.139
you might as well stay
at my place or kenny's.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.408
That sounds just perfect.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.410
One thing you do have here
is good friends.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.544
You can stay home as long.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.012
I love ya'll.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.048
-Thank you ya'll
for always being here.
-Let's get it done.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.250
We don't have liquor here,
folks, I don't know.

38:40.252 --> 38:42.185
We got liquor
on the little one.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.555
Mmm-mmm.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.624
Let's see what
we got going on here.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.959
The honey that we cherished,
is that a mash bill, or what?

38:49.961 --> 38:52.128
I tell you what,
that's a hell of a mash bill.

38:52.130 --> 38:55.598
Almost like a grain liquor,
a brandy,

38:55.600 --> 38:59.035
and damn near mixed drink,
mixed all in one.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.603
It's got one
hell of a smell to it.

39:00.605 --> 39:01.805
It's definitely unique,

39:01.807 --> 39:05.175
and some of the best liquor
I've ever drank
in my life.

39:05.177 --> 39:08.378
Tell you what,
that right there's gonna
be some high-dollar liquor.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.414
Check that out.

39:11.416 --> 39:13.149
Running good, man.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.854
That's a good stream
'cause you got to keep in mind

39:17.856 --> 39:19.556
we've got two stills running
into that one thumper.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.091
Just one burner.

39:21.093 --> 39:23.426
-About time we tried
those other stills.
-Yes, it is.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.695
-Here we go.
-All right.

39:25.697 --> 39:29.833
While these things
are running, we gotta start
heating these other pots up.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.335
That way with these things in,

39:33.071 --> 39:35.071
it's time to cap
them things off,

39:35.073 --> 39:39.409
we'll be running liquor again
off the whole
next set of stills.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.112
Honey, cherry, wheat.

39:42.114 --> 39:44.914
You didn't think
it would be that strong,
did you?

39:44.916 --> 39:46.349
It's about a 105.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.585
There you go.

39:48.587 --> 39:50.687
Yeah, kenny,
you're probably right,
probably 105.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.857
-[all laughing]
-[tickle] hold on there,
brother.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.326
<i>  We finished running</i>
<i>  our small pots</i>

39:56.328 --> 39:58.862
<i>  and our big pots</i>
<i>  are tailing off right now.</i>

39:58.864 --> 40:03.933
To most moonshiners that would
be one hell of a day
under their belt.

40:06.138 --> 40:08.304
But our day's only
halfway through.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.243
It probably ain't going to be
too much longer
that's gonna be running.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.211
There she come, boys.

40:15.814 --> 40:16.880
[kenny] tell you what, fellas,

40:17.149 --> 40:20.150
this one's pouring it out,
I can tell you that much.

40:20.385 --> 40:21.384
[tickle] hell, yeah.

40:24.689 --> 40:28.391
The way we proof liquor,
we never add water to it.

40:28.393 --> 40:29.692
As you run your moonshine,

40:29.694 --> 40:31.795
<i>  gradually your proof</i>
<i>  will drop,</i>

40:31.797 --> 40:34.831
<i>  so we'll add the lower</i>
<i>  proof stuff to the higher</i>
<i>  proof stuff,</i>

40:34.833 --> 40:38.902
so that way we're always
adding liquor to it

40:38.904 --> 40:40.770
and when it gets down
to the proof that you want it,

40:40.772 --> 40:43.006
that's where we cut it off at.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.007
All right, boss, it's done.
It's done.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.675
Cut it off
and put on some cap.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.410
[josh] let it rip, tater chip.

40:47.412 --> 40:51.181
With all eight of these pots,
we just made over 600 gallons

40:51.183 --> 40:53.716
of good liquor in one day.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.218
Damn, still is hot.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.854
Yeah, damn right,
that thing's scalding.

40:57.856 --> 41:01.558
But we're talking about
massive amounts
of liquor right here.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.460
All right, here we go, boys.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.628
This is gonna make our jobs
a whole lot easier.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.698
So what we're gonna do is,
henry's got this pump,

41:08.700 --> 41:11.768
we're just gonna pump it
over here into these totes

41:11.770 --> 41:13.269
and be out of here in no time.

41:14.306 --> 41:15.638
Here she comes.

41:15.774 --> 41:18.508
Things have changed
from back in the day
and doing this stuff.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.810
They'd be bucketing
all this up and trying
to get it out of here.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.479
And you know,
we got these pumps and stuff.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.114
I thought about how those
old-timers got all that stuff

41:25.116 --> 41:28.051
in and out of the woods
when they weren't using
vehicles.

41:28.053 --> 41:29.385
[kenny] some had mules.

41:29.387 --> 41:31.888
I knew someone,
he had a mule,
got caught five times.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.724
The law would turn up,
the mule got caught
more than anybody.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.093
[all laughing]

41:48.540 --> 41:51.040
oh, I hope that stuff's
ready to go, puss.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.642
We're coming in here
to run this rye this morning.

41:52.644 --> 41:53.843
Oh, yeah.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.713
-It ain't doing nothing.
-It's deader than a mackerel.

41:56.715 --> 41:59.582
All this mash that
we've built looks great.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.818
We've got plenty of alcohol
in it for an all grain mash.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.419
I believe this part is
your old drawers.

42:03.421 --> 42:05.021
Oh, they're way too white.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.824
I don't know why we didn't
think about bringing
a little pump.

42:07.826 --> 42:08.992
Damn, it smells good,
don't it?

42:08.994 --> 42:11.427
Like a loaf of hot rye bread.

42:11.429 --> 42:15.765
This mash, it's rich,
it's nothing but rye flavor.

42:15.767 --> 42:18.701
This is gonna be some
best tasting rye liquor
we've ever made.

42:18.703 --> 42:22.405
-You good?
-Better than average.

42:22.407 --> 42:25.375
<i>  We get to the end,</i>
<i>  the mash is very,</i>
<i>  very thick</i>

42:25.377 --> 42:28.011
<i>  but it's all flavor</i>
<i>  at this point, so,</i>

42:28.013 --> 42:29.279
we feel good about it.

42:29.848 --> 42:30.980
Look at it.

42:30.982 --> 42:33.383
Kinda reminds me
of castrating cattle.

42:33.385 --> 42:35.385
I never did castrate no cows.

42:35.854 --> 42:37.687
With the fact that
there's no sugars,

42:37.689 --> 42:40.924
we're gonna end up
with less abv in this batch.

42:40.926 --> 42:44.694
<i> Therefore we have to get every</i>
<i>  bit of that liquid</i>
<i>  into the still.</i>

42:44.696 --> 42:46.296
Let's get this lit up
and heating up.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.932
-It goes poof.
-Woah!

42:48.967 --> 42:50.233
That's sure good.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.435
Let's go ahead
and cap this up.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.004
Damn.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.174
You know after
it reaches about 170,

42:58.176 --> 42:59.576
you gotta really keep
an eye on it,

42:59.578 --> 43:02.245
'cause it comes quick.

43:02.247 --> 43:05.181
-This is the part I hate.
-The hurry up and wait.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.919
There'll be liquor
out of here
any minute.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.955
It works quick, ain't it?

43:11.957 --> 43:13.256
Is it done here?

43:13.558 --> 43:14.591
You tell me.

43:14.593 --> 43:18.094
-Oh, yeah. Look, look, look.
-Liquor, puss.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.330
Glad we've dropped
old dodger in there.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.865
There we go!

43:22.867 --> 43:24.901
That's fine stream
right there.

43:24.903 --> 43:26.836
You know, everything's heated
up right now,

43:26.838 --> 43:28.871
starting to push
liquor through.

43:28.873 --> 43:34.043
I'm telling you there's
a tremendous rye odor
right around this still pot.

43:35.714 --> 43:37.180
Holy moly.

43:37.182 --> 43:39.048
I believe my nose lied to me.

43:39.050 --> 43:40.383
What did it say?

43:40.385 --> 43:42.986
It said, "it's the best rye
you've ever smelled
in your life".

43:47.692 --> 43:49.759
-Goddamn, that's rye.
-Yeah.

43:49.761 --> 43:52.261
Inside, outside, upside down.

43:52.263 --> 43:55.231
When we get toward
the end of the middlings
you taste the jar,

43:55.233 --> 43:59.035
man, it's spot on.
It's exactly where this guy's
gonna want his liquor.

43:59.037 --> 44:01.838
-That's really fine,
fine liquor.
-It is.

44:01.840 --> 44:06.676
Rye whiskey, you know it's
a very, very spicy note
in your mouth, I mean,

44:06.678 --> 44:08.778
all your little taste buds
come alive.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.980
-Well?
-I'm a corn liquor man.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.816
But our customer
don't want corn liquor,

44:13.818 --> 44:15.985
and if it's rye he wanted,

44:15.987 --> 44:17.887
it's damn sure rye
he's going to get.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.390
Right there,
we're on jar number six.

44:20.392 --> 44:22.125
We're still pretty stout.

44:22.127 --> 44:24.861
I'm gonna say, we're going
to get close to eight jars
out of this round.

44:24.863 --> 44:26.162
Let's shut her down.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.564
Shut her down,
we'll let it run in there
what it run.

44:28.566 --> 44:33.703
<i> You know now that it's obvious</i>
<i>  that we are going to produce</i>
<i>  good rye whiskey,</i>

44:33.705 --> 44:36.606
we've got to come up
with a way to age this right.

44:36.608 --> 44:38.708
-May I ask you, puss?
-Uh-huh.

44:38.710 --> 44:40.176
So, you say
you've got a notion

44:40.745 --> 44:41.611
about how we can age this

44:41.613 --> 44:43.546
in two months or less?

44:43.548 --> 44:46.749
I mean, don't you think
it's about time you shared
that information

44:46.751 --> 44:49.118
with me if you have really
thought about it?

44:49.421 --> 44:50.853
You're gonna call me crazy.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.855
Well, that ain't nothing new.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.323
I'm gonna put it on the ufo.

44:54.826 --> 44:56.926
[both laughing]

44:56.928 --> 45:00.930
no, I read a little article
about ultrasonic aging

45:00.932 --> 45:01.731
that they're
experimenting with.

45:01.733 --> 45:04.333
Ultrasonic?
What the hell is that?

45:18.683 --> 45:21.751
[jaime] the first agave
I planted was here
in this area.

45:21.753 --> 45:26.856
This land belongs
to our family from more
than 70 years, maybe.

45:26.858 --> 45:29.892
My whole reason I'm here,
I wanna know
how do you make tequila.

45:29.894 --> 45:32.428
You know,
where does it come from?

45:32.430 --> 45:34.764
All the agave we have here
is blue agave.

45:34.766 --> 45:38.367
That's the right agave
to make tequila.

45:38.369 --> 45:40.937
<i> [tim] I don't know</i>
<i>  how far it goes</i>
<i>  or how many acres,</i>

45:40.939 --> 45:43.806
<i>  but as far as I can see</i>
<i>  all the way to the mountain.</i>

45:43.808 --> 45:44.841
All I see is agave.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.375
When you plant this,

45:46.377 --> 45:48.611
-they this big?
-Yes, they this big.

45:48.613 --> 45:51.848
Yeah, these ones we actually
planted on may, last year.

45:51.850 --> 45:53.683
Yeah, so it's only one year
and a half.

45:53.685 --> 45:54.917
You know,
these are young agave.

45:54.919 --> 45:58.154
We have to wait almost
seven, eight years.

45:58.156 --> 45:59.789
-That's a long time.
-It is.

45:59.791 --> 46:02.925
In my world, we grow corn
and barley and wheat

46:02.927 --> 46:05.695
<i>  and we distill it,</i>
<i>  it's a one-year thing.</i>

46:05.697 --> 46:07.396
There's a lot
of work involved here.

46:07.398 --> 46:10.032
Do you have to buy
it from somewhere?

46:10.034 --> 46:14.771
We, we take care
of the smaller agaves,
the baby agaves, the seeds.

46:14.773 --> 46:16.139
And we replant it.

46:16.141 --> 46:18.875
-You see those small,
baby agaves over there?
-I see it coming up.

46:18.877 --> 46:20.710
-Such a sprout.
-Yes.

46:20.712 --> 46:25.414
This agave gives like a two
or five different baby agaves.

46:25.416 --> 46:28.751
Some of these plants,
are producing little plants.

46:28.753 --> 46:32.421
<i>  When they get big enough</i>
<i>  they pull this</i>
<i>  from their mother plant</i>

46:32.423 --> 46:35.258
<i>  and transplant those</i>
<i>  to make more</i>
<i>  and bigger plants.</i>

46:35.260 --> 46:38.761
But how do you plant the whole
field at the same time?

46:38.763 --> 46:40.663
You know, I'm thinking,
do they plant it
with a machine?

46:40.665 --> 46:41.664
One by one.
By hand.

46:41.666 --> 46:43.432
One by one by hand.
I contract guys.

46:43.434 --> 46:44.834
So, they're gonna plant it,

46:44.836 --> 46:48.571
and they're gonna watch
over it every year
until they harvest it

46:48.573 --> 46:50.606
and then they have to come
and chop it,

46:50.608 --> 46:52.575
<i>  and then take</i>
<i>  it to the distillery.</i>

46:52.577 --> 46:55.044
Remember when you have
a glass of tequila
in your hand,

46:55.046 --> 46:57.914
seven years ago,
that is a lot of people,

46:57.916 --> 47:00.249
-around here
planted the agave.
-Yeah. Planted.

47:02.153 --> 47:04.687
We call this, uh, the valley.

47:04.689 --> 47:06.522
Of agave plantations.

47:06.524 --> 47:08.024
-The valley?
-The valley.

47:08.026 --> 47:10.760
And there is the highlands,
in the south of jalisco,

47:10.762 --> 47:12.662
they make a very good
tequila over there.

47:12.664 --> 47:15.731
-Higher?
-A little bit higher
than this, yes.

47:15.733 --> 47:17.733
You want to try
the best tequila

47:17.735 --> 47:21.704
-and you compare,
you got to try both areas.
-Mmm-hmm.

47:21.706 --> 47:24.073
He recommends that
I go to the highlands,

47:24.075 --> 47:25.441
which is a couple
of hours away,

47:25.443 --> 47:28.578
<i>  where the blue agave</i>
<i>  is grown in a different</i>
<i>  environment.</i>

47:28.580 --> 47:31.614
And it also gives a different
taste profile to the tequila.

47:31.616 --> 47:35.017
So, I'm gonna get the taste
of something else.

47:35.019 --> 47:37.620
So we finished
the field of agaves.

47:37.622 --> 47:38.554
Yeah.

47:38.556 --> 47:40.790
That was a good,
educational trip.

47:40.792 --> 47:43.426
It's very special for my
first time in mexico.

47:43.428 --> 47:45.928
<i>  Just meeting with jaime</i>
<i>  was a great honor.</i>

47:45.930 --> 47:47.997
It's time to go back.
Because it's tequila time.

47:47.999 --> 47:48.965
It's tequila time?

47:48.967 --> 47:49.732
Anytime is a tequila time.

47:49.734 --> 47:50.833
-Okay. Let's go.
-Come on.

47:50.835 --> 47:53.402
We're gonna head back
to the distillery right now,

47:53.404 --> 47:55.938
have one more drink with jaime
and his sons,

47:55.940 --> 47:57.273
and I'm heading
to the highlands.
