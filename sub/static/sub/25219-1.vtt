18:35.321 --> 18:37.668
By the ridge of grass over
here, and I've seen a few

18:37.668 --> 18:39.635
of them over there, so
we gonna go look for 'em,

18:39.635 --> 18:41.465
on that side over there.

18:41.465 --> 18:45.089
[propeller engine roaring]

18:54.754 --> 18:56.997
Look down there in the grass.

18:56.997 --> 19:00.829
It's a cat tail, what
they call a cat tail.

19:00.829 --> 19:03.038
If you look real close you'll
see one of those snakes

19:03.038 --> 19:04.695
coiled up right there.

19:04.695 --> 19:07.905
It's about six feet from
us, big old snake coiled up,

19:07.905 --> 19:09.355
right there.

19:09.355 --> 19:11.426
A little bit further,
little further out,

19:11.426 --> 19:12.841
you're looking a little
bit to close to the boat,

19:12.841 --> 19:14.049
little further out.

19:14.049 --> 19:17.017
Yep, curled up
there, kind of green

19:17.017 --> 19:19.054
with some black stripes in it,

19:19.054 --> 19:21.470
that's called an
Everglades green snake.

19:21.470 --> 19:23.092
They get pretty big out here.

19:23.092 --> 19:24.956
- [Anna] Are they venomous?

19:24.956 --> 19:26.406
- Yes they are.

19:26.406 --> 19:28.477
If they bite you on the ass
I'll suck the venom out for you.

19:28.477 --> 19:30.824
[group laughs]

19:30.824 --> 19:31.653
- [Tyler] I like this guy.

19:31.653 --> 19:32.999
I like this fucking guy.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.207
- [Anna] I still don't see him.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.657
- Well, you could just
walk out there I guess,

19:35.657 --> 19:37.383
find it that way.

19:37.383 --> 19:40.524
Just pretend that your going
in there for a skinny dipping,

19:40.524 --> 19:44.700
just take your clothes off,
run right on up in there.

19:44.700 --> 19:48.187
Yeah, we do it out
here all the time.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.705
- [Tanya] How deep does it go?

19:49.705 --> 19:51.017
[Nicole screaming]

19:51.017 --> 19:53.261
[laughing]

19:56.885 --> 19:58.990
- [Tyler] Yeah, Derek my man.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.716
Derek you a pussy or you a bro?

20:00.716 --> 20:01.648
- [Derek] Come on Tyler.

20:01.648 --> 20:02.891
- You and me, let's go.

20:02.891 --> 20:04.375
- You a pussy or you a,
you, I know I'm a bro.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.170
Oh yo, step right up,
this is your plan,

20:06.170 --> 20:07.654
this is your idea, brother.

20:07.654 --> 20:09.484
- It's not like their even
gonna catch it anyways.

20:09.484 --> 20:11.417
I don't know what
the big deal is.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.281
- [Henry] It's
about six foot out.

20:13.281 --> 20:15.628
- Oh, you're so sweet.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.733
- They're not gonna
catch any snakes.

20:17.733 --> 20:21.910
Oh, there's a small one, I'm
scared, where's the big ones.

20:24.775 --> 20:26.259
- [Henry] About a foot
and a half out here.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.469
- Whatever, the boat ride's
kind of fun but this is dumb.

20:29.469 --> 20:31.437
- [Leah] The boat
ride is more then fun.

20:31.437 --> 20:35.613
- [Henry] Let's move on,
there's gotta be more out here.

20:35.613 --> 20:38.616
[upbeat jazz music]

20:50.110 --> 20:53.113
[propeller roaring]

21:00.638 --> 21:02.226
- Here's something of interest.

21:02.226 --> 21:04.918
An old camp out in
here in the Everglades.

21:04.918 --> 21:07.887
It goes back many, many years.

21:07.887 --> 21:11.477
It was actually
started back in 1953.

21:11.477 --> 21:15.170
There's a lot of history behind
it, and it's not all good.

21:15.170 --> 21:17.414
It was actually it was started
by hunters that used to

21:17.414 --> 21:19.726
live out here and make
their living out here

21:19.726 --> 21:22.902
and a lot of people have
been injured out here,

21:22.902 --> 21:26.146
and it's been said
that a few have died.

21:26.146 --> 21:28.114
At least one man
tried to burn it down.

21:28.114 --> 21:30.185
But not too many people
want to go in there,

21:30.185 --> 21:31.945
because you just don't know.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.706
It's just one of them places
that I've kind of shunned

21:33.706 --> 21:37.434
and stayed away from
because it's just bad karma.

21:37.434 --> 21:38.366
- Does anyone live there?

21:38.366 --> 21:40.747
- Oh no, nobody lives there.

21:40.747 --> 21:43.509
I mean, no, nobody in their
right mind lives there.

21:43.509 --> 21:47.754
It hasn't been well taken
care of, so I just tend

21:47.754 --> 21:50.239
to stay away from it myself
cause you just don't never know

21:50.239 --> 21:53.795
what's gonna happen next out
here next in the Everglades.

21:53.795 --> 21:55.521
A lot of people
carry guns with them

21:55.521 --> 21:57.730
because they've had
some real bad stories.

21:57.730 --> 22:01.043
- It's a fucking tourist
story alright, calm down.

22:01.043 --> 22:02.390
[laughing]

22:02.390 --> 22:03.736
- [Toni] It sounds like
a secret party that

22:03.736 --> 22:05.393
no one knows about
except for us.

22:05.393 --> 22:08.085
- [Henry] Yeah, that'd be an
awesome party right there.

22:08.085 --> 22:09.707
- [Nicole] I think I'll
just stay in the boat.

22:09.707 --> 22:11.433
- [Tanya] I'm with
her on that one.

22:11.433 --> 22:12.469
- [Nicole] I'll be fine.

22:12.469 --> 22:13.401
- Well.

22:13.401 --> 22:14.678
- [Nicole] Head home, you know.

22:14.678 --> 22:17.266
- Yeah, we got some
weather moving in,

22:17.266 --> 22:18.578
so it'd probably be
a good time for us

22:18.578 --> 22:20.131
to start working
our way back in.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.375
- Yeah guys, I mean,
my drunk is faded,

22:22.375 --> 22:23.480
let' go get some booze.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.688
- Yes.

22:24.688 --> 22:27.276
- Derek, good idea
but I think you know.

22:27.276 --> 22:29.969
- Don't want to be
out here after dark.

22:29.969 --> 22:31.384
- [Derek] Hell no,
definitely not.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.110
- [Tanya] We can all
agree, we don't want that.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.353
- [Marcus] Oh no, fuck that.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.871
- [Derek] Even I don't
want to be here at dark.

22:35.871 --> 22:38.357
- [Tyler] Yeah fuck your snakes.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.567
[propeller sputtering]

22:44.155 --> 22:46.951
- [Jocelyn] You're so funny.

22:46.951 --> 22:48.194
- [Derek] Is everything good?

22:48.194 --> 22:49.022
- [Marcus] Oh that's awesome.

22:49.022 --> 22:50.299
- [Derek] What happened?

22:50.299 --> 22:51.577
- [Tyler] Yo, quit
dicking around.

22:51.577 --> 22:52.854
- The break jams out
of the way, now so.

22:52.854 --> 22:53.544
- [Anna] Oh, he's
fucking with us.

22:53.544 --> 22:54.373
- No big deal.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.029
- [Toni] Come on Gerald.

22:57.134 --> 22:58.100
- [Anna] What?

22:58.100 --> 22:59.343
- [Tyler] I swear to God,

22:59.343 --> 23:01.276
if this fucking
boat doesn't start.

23:01.276 --> 23:02.760
- [Derek] Is everything okay?

23:02.760 --> 23:04.037
- [Toni] Has this
happened before?

23:04.037 --> 23:05.936
Like is it normal
for you boat to die?

23:05.936 --> 23:08.456
- [Marcus] Fuck that,
what's wrong with the boat?

23:08.456 --> 23:09.767
- [Tyler] Come on, my man.

23:09.767 --> 23:10.699
- [Nicole] Are you
sure you're okay?

23:10.699 --> 23:14.185
[kids talking over each other]

23:14.185 --> 23:15.946
- Junk Japanese shit.

23:17.085 --> 23:18.983
Raggedy ass boat, this
thing always been,

23:18.983 --> 23:21.158
one damn damn problem
after the other.

23:21.158 --> 23:24.679
- Henry my man, I mean, oh come
on it's cool, it was funny,

23:24.679 --> 23:27.129
but, like, let's go, brother.

23:27.129 --> 23:29.131
- He doesn't look okay.

23:30.616 --> 23:32.134
- [Henry] Damn it!

23:33.964 --> 23:34.792
Ah shit.

23:36.898 --> 23:37.830
- [Marcus] We're in the
middle of bum fuck nowhere.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.694
- [Tankya] What can we do like.

23:39.694 --> 23:41.385
- [Jocelyn] Oh my god.

23:41.385 --> 23:42.869
- [Toni] Maybe,
don't, don't stand.

23:42.869 --> 23:43.801
- [Nicole] Tyler, be
careful, just sit down.

23:43.801 --> 23:45.147
- [Tyler] Hey man, you alright?

23:45.147 --> 23:48.979
Yeah we gotta get back,
can drive this thing?

23:51.222 --> 23:52.948
- [Anna] Does anybody have
water in their backpack?

23:52.948 --> 23:55.503
- Somebody got some water.

23:55.503 --> 23:56.987
Get it, hurry up.

23:56.987 --> 23:58.747
Give him the fucking
water bottle.

23:58.747 --> 24:02.510
[kids talking over each over]

24:06.375 --> 24:07.549
What you got?

24:07.549 --> 24:08.688
What do you need in here?

24:08.688 --> 24:10.034
You sick or some shit?

24:10.034 --> 24:11.277
You need a [stutters].

24:11.277 --> 24:12.485
- [Tanya] Just open it
and maybe we can guess.

24:12.485 --> 24:13.210
- [Tyler] I can't
fucking open it.

24:13.210 --> 24:14.038
[Henry groans]

24:14.038 --> 24:14.867
- [Tanya] Just try it.

24:14.867 --> 24:15.799
- [Tyler] Shit!

24:15.799 --> 24:18.318
Hey, hey, Henry, Henry, Henry.

24:19.216 --> 24:20.320
Henry, Henry!

24:21.839 --> 24:23.254
- [Jocelyn] Get him
up on his, get him up,

24:23.254 --> 24:25.636
make sure he can breathe!

24:25.636 --> 24:27.845
- [Tyler] Fucking Christ, Henry!

24:27.845 --> 24:29.468
Look in the box, the
fucking box, look

24:29.468 --> 24:31.262
for a pill bottle or some shit.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.091
Yo Henry!

24:33.472 --> 24:34.852
- [Nicole] Henry,
are you okay? !

24:34.852 --> 24:36.923
[kids yelling over one another]

24:36.923 --> 24:38.028
- [Anna] Pills probably!

24:38.028 --> 24:39.270
- [Marcus] A fucking flashlight.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.617
- [Nicole] Does
anybody know CPR?

24:40.617 --> 24:41.721
- [Jocelyn] Why
is this happening?

24:41.721 --> 24:42.929
- [Marcus] Fuck!

24:42.929 --> 24:43.723
- [Nicole] I can't
get his pulse.

24:43.723 --> 24:45.000
- [Jocelyn] Oh my god.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.521
- [Anna] Give him CPR,
somebody give him CPR.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.385
Tyler do something.

24:50.385 --> 24:53.008
- What? Stop yelling at
me it's not my fault.

24:53.008 --> 24:54.113
- [Anna] Tyler do something.

24:54.113 --> 24:55.321
- What do want me to do.

24:55.321 --> 24:56.322
- [Marcus] Dude,
calm the fuck down.

24:56.322 --> 24:57.496
We gotta get the
fuck outta here.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.324
- [Jocelyn] This is
all your fucking fault.

24:58.324 --> 24:58.980
- [Tyler] I know we do!

24:58.980 --> 25:01.500
[kids yelling]

25:02.880 --> 25:03.709
- Hey, hey.

25:03.709 --> 25:05.262
- Hey, calm down!

25:05.262 --> 25:06.643
- [Tyler] Alright. Fuck.

25:06.643 --> 25:07.506
- [Marcus] Try and
start the fucking boat.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.162
- [Tanya] Give him CPR!

25:09.162 --> 25:10.198
Does anybody have service?

25:10.198 --> 25:11.026
- [Marcus] My phone's dead.

25:11.026 --> 25:13.512
- [Nicole] Oh my god.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.789
- [Jocelyn] There's no signal.

25:14.789 --> 25:16.894
- [Anna] Does anyone
else have a signal?

25:16.894 --> 25:21.554
[kids talking over each other]

25:21.554 --> 25:22.521
- [Patrick] Did you
check for a radio?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.729
- [Marcus] Check this shit!

25:23.729 --> 25:25.316
- [Tanya] Radio, flare,
flashlights, anything?

25:25.316 --> 25:26.697
- [Marcus] We got
a flashlight, guys.

25:26.697 --> 25:28.665
Okay worst case scenario
we got a flashlight.

25:28.665 --> 25:29.838
- Hey!

25:29.838 --> 25:30.667
- [Jocelyn] It's already gone.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.565
- [Anna] No flares.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.980
- Hey come on, can you hear me?

25:33.980 --> 25:34.947
- [Nicole] There's
literally nothing in here.

25:34.947 --> 25:35.913
- I can't even open this.

25:35.913 --> 25:37.432
Tyler, look a medical kit.

25:37.432 --> 25:39.158
- [Nicole] He has fucking
head phones, that's it.

25:39.158 --> 25:40.331
- I don't know what
the fuck to do with it.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.643
- We're running out of daylight,

25:41.643 --> 25:42.851
let's at least make
it to the cabin,

25:42.851 --> 25:44.232
so we have shelter at least.

25:44.232 --> 25:45.440
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.648
- [Derek] Dude, we can't
stay here all night.

25:46.648 --> 25:48.098
- [Anna] I don't want
to get off the boat.

25:48.098 --> 25:49.617
- [Toni] Did you not
hear what he said though?

25:49.617 --> 25:50.825
- [Marcus] We're in a boat
in the middle of nowhere.

25:50.825 --> 25:52.654
We need to do something!

25:52.654 --> 25:54.725
[murmuring]

25:54.725 --> 25:56.140
Okay let's go.

25:56.140 --> 25:57.556
- We're gonna get in this water?

25:57.556 --> 26:00.662
- [Derek] Let's do it,
we only have one option.

26:00.662 --> 26:01.939
- [Toni] Which is?

26:01.939 --> 26:03.596
- [Derek] We gotta
make it to there!

26:03.596 --> 26:04.563
- [Toni] How?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.287
- [Derek] It's right there.

26:05.287 --> 26:06.703
We can make it.

26:06.703 --> 26:09.637
- [Tanya] Oh, oh my
gosh, don't get in there.

26:09.637 --> 26:10.499
Oh my god.

26:13.364 --> 26:14.607
Be careful.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.368
- [Anna] Don't you
hop in there, too.

26:18.853 --> 26:20.958
- [Tanya] Oh my god, ah!

26:20.958 --> 26:23.305
[screaming]

26:24.583 --> 26:27.033
[dark music]

26:31.866 --> 26:34.213
- [Jocelyn] My shoe's stuck!

26:39.701 --> 26:41.358
- [Marcus] Let's go, one foot
in front of the other, guys,

26:41.358 --> 26:42.186
let's go, let's go.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.912
[girls screaming]

26:43.912 --> 26:46.674
- [Jocelyn] I lost my shoe!

26:46.674 --> 26:49.090
[dark music]

27:24.746 --> 27:26.645
- [Tanya] Oh my God.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.060
I lost it, it's gone.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.200
- [Jocelyn] This
isn't funny, guys,

27:30.200 --> 27:31.650
this isn't funny,

27:31.650 --> 27:32.581
- [Tyler] Just

27:32.581 --> 27:33.375
give me your fucking hand.

27:33.375 --> 27:34.618
- [Jocelyn] I can't.

27:34.618 --> 27:35.412
- [Tyler] Give me your
hand, let's just go.

27:35.412 --> 27:36.068
- [Jocelyn] Oh my god!

27:36.068 --> 27:37.552
[screaming]

27:37.552 --> 27:38.380
- [Anna] We're almost
there, we're almost there.

27:38.380 --> 27:39.312
- [Derek] Keep moving!

27:39.312 --> 27:40.106
- [Nicole] It's just grass.

27:40.106 --> 27:41.038
- [Derek] Keep moving!

27:41.038 --> 27:41.832
- [Nicole] It's just grass.

27:41.832 --> 27:44.559
[girls screaming]

27:50.082 --> 27:53.085
- [Tanya] Almost,
almost, almost.

27:53.085 --> 27:54.983
- [Jocelyn] Oh my God!

28:04.613 --> 28:06.132
- [Marcus] This fucking sucks.

28:06.132 --> 28:07.409
Fuck you Derek!

28:12.069 --> 28:14.658
[creepy music]

28:19.318 --> 28:20.526
- [Derek] Is everyone here?

28:20.526 --> 28:21.458
- [Anna] There's
water in everything.

28:21.458 --> 28:23.011
- [Leah] Are you alright?

28:23.011 --> 28:24.047
- [Jocelyn] My leg.

28:24.047 --> 28:25.634
- [Tyler] You stupid idiot!

28:25.634 --> 28:26.497
[kids yelling]

28:26.497 --> 28:27.360
- Stop!

28:27.360 --> 28:29.466
[yelling]

28:29.466 --> 28:31.054
- [Tyler] I'll kill you!

28:31.054 --> 28:32.331
I'll fucking kill you!

28:32.331 --> 28:33.781
- [Derek] Get the
fuck away from me!

28:33.781 --> 28:34.885
- [Anna] Stop, stop, stop, no.

28:34.885 --> 28:37.577
- [Nicole] This is not the time!

28:37.577 --> 28:40.822
- [Patrick] Chill, chill, chill.

28:40.822 --> 28:44.274
- [Marcus] Chill,

28:44.274 --> 28:45.965
- [Tyler] Well keep that
mother fucker away from me!

28:45.965 --> 28:47.242
It's all your goddamn fault!

28:47.242 --> 28:48.554
[yelling]

28:48.554 --> 28:49.762
- [Derek] How the fuck
am I supposed to know

28:49.762 --> 28:52.178
this was gonna happen?

28:52.178 --> 28:53.386
- [Marcus] Just
stay there, chill.

28:53.386 --> 28:54.905
- [Anna] We're here,
let's go inside.

28:54.905 --> 28:58.357
- [Nicole] We have to find
somebody who can help us.

28:58.357 --> 28:59.772
I don't have cell phone service,

28:59.772 --> 29:02.775
so everybody else needs to
check their phones for service.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.432
- [Marcus] Come on
let's get in the house.

29:04.432 --> 29:06.883
- [Anna] Come on let's go,
everybody take their phones out.

29:06.883 --> 29:07.884
- [Marcus] Sit, sit, sit.

29:07.884 --> 29:08.747
- [Nicole] Who has their phone?

29:08.747 --> 29:09.609
My phones gonna die.

29:09.609 --> 29:11.439
I don't have service.

29:12.578 --> 29:14.028
- [Patrick Does
anyone have service?

29:14.028 --> 29:15.995
- [Marcus] Let me get
the camera, Leah, camera.

29:15.995 --> 29:17.652
- [Jocelyn] Oh, this
stings and burns.

29:17.652 --> 29:20.206
- [Nicole] I think
it's just a scratch.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.725
- [Tanya] Is it alright though?

29:21.725 --> 29:24.383
- [Derek] I got like
no battery, fuck.

29:24.383 --> 29:25.556
- [Tanya] Does this place
even have electricity?

29:25.556 --> 29:26.385
- [Marcus] Let's check inside.

29:26.385 --> 29:28.283
- [Anna] Be careful.

29:28.283 --> 29:29.526
- [Marcus] Obviously.

29:29.526 --> 29:30.769
- [Nicole] Hey, we
can not go in there!

29:30.769 --> 29:32.011
- [Anna] Shh. We
have to find help.

29:32.011 --> 29:32.805
- [Nicole] But this
place is abandoned,

29:32.805 --> 29:33.772
we can not go in there.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.842
Didn't you hear what he said?

29:34.842 --> 29:36.257
- Would you shut the fuck up!

29:36.257 --> 29:37.776
Dude, there's a fucking
confederate flag hanging there,

29:37.776 --> 29:38.984
two of us aren't invited.

29:38.984 --> 29:39.916
- [Nicole] That's
more the reason for us

29:39.916 --> 29:41.572
not to go in that house.

29:41.572 --> 29:42.366
- [Marcus] That's
more the reason for
us to shut the fuck up

29:42.366 --> 29:43.609
and not get found.

29:43.609 --> 29:44.541
- [Anna] Let's just
try to open the door.

29:44.541 --> 29:45.266
- [Derek] Check the door.

29:45.266 --> 29:46.474
Can we get in?

29:46.474 --> 29:47.786
- [Marcus] No,
the door's locked.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.442
- [Anna] No.

29:49.442 --> 29:50.892
- [Derek] I can't see shit.

29:50.892 --> 29:52.307
- [Anna] There's gotta
be a side door somewhere.

29:52.307 --> 29:55.448
- [Marcus] Check the
other ones, obviously.

29:55.448 --> 29:56.691
- [Derek] Let's go around.

29:56.691 --> 29:57.485
- [Nicole] I want to
go away from here.

29:57.485 --> 29:58.279
- [Marcus] Just relax.

29:58.279 --> 29:59.211
- [Derek] Hello!

29:59.211 --> 30:00.868
- [Marcus] Shut the fuck up.

30:00.868 --> 30:02.007
- [Anna] Quiet.

30:02.007 --> 30:03.525
- [Tanya] It's abandoned.

30:03.525 --> 30:04.768
- [Marcus] We don't know
that, we don't know that.

30:04.768 --> 30:06.218
- [Anna] That's
what the guy said.

30:06.218 --> 30:07.391
- [Nicole] Yeah, that's why
we need to leave though.

30:07.391 --> 30:08.323
- [Tanya] That
guy's fucking dead.

30:08.323 --> 30:09.566
- [Derek] What the hell is that?

30:09.566 --> 30:10.878
- [Marcus] Shows
how much he knows.

30:10.878 --> 30:12.120
- [Nicole] I don't
want to be here.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.570
I do not want to be here!

30:13.570 --> 30:15.261
- [Tanya] And now he's dead.

30:15.261 --> 30:16.815
- [Nicole] Call somebody.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.264
- [Marcus] Yo, we can't wait
the fuck out here you guys.

30:18.264 --> 30:19.196
Just give me a second,
I'm going to check it out.

30:19.196 --> 30:20.439
- [Tanya] Dude, just stop.

30:20.439 --> 30:21.371
- [Nicole] I don't
want to be here,

30:21.371 --> 30:22.613
I do not want to be here.

30:22.613 --> 30:23.407
- [Tanya] Well what
are we supposed to do?

30:23.407 --> 30:24.684
Stay there with him?

30:24.684 --> 30:25.478
- [Marcus] So fucking
stupid, I'm gonna die

30:25.478 --> 30:26.410
because of you guys.

30:26.410 --> 30:27.756
- [Derek] Check the door.

30:27.756 --> 30:28.585
- [Nicole] Oh my god.

30:28.585 --> 30:29.517
- Careful, careful.

30:29.517 --> 30:30.449
Everyone come inside.

30:30.449 --> 30:31.864
- [Nicole] Everyone inside.

30:31.864 --> 30:32.554
- [Marcus] Just hold on
guys, I'm gonna check it out.

30:32.554 --> 30:33.624
Whoa whoa.

30:33.624 --> 30:34.833
- [Anna] Hello.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.834
- [Patrick] Where
the hell are we?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.076
- [Marcus] Nowhere I wanna be.

30:37.076 --> 30:38.353
- [Nicole] I'm not
going in there.

30:38.353 --> 30:39.320
- [Tanya] Are we
gonna stand around

30:39.320 --> 30:40.528
and wait to get eaten alive?

30:40.528 --> 30:41.218
- [Anna] Wait,
wait, everything's--

30:41.218 --> 30:42.047
- [Derek] Hello?

30:42.047 --> 30:43.324

30:43.324 --> 30:44.014
- [Marcus] Would you
guys shut the fuck up?

30:44.014 --> 30:45.291
It's abandoned.

30:45.291 --> 30:46.534
- [Anna] What, we
might find somebody.

30:46.534 --> 30:47.293
- [Marcus] It's
a-fucking-bandoned.

30:47.293 --> 30:48.122
- Shit.
- Hello?

30:48.122 --> 30:49.364
- [Leah] Are you okay?

30:49.364 --> 30:50.296

fine, I'm just dizzy.

30:51.988 --> 30:52.851
- [Tanya] Hello!

30:52.851 --> 30:54.369
- [Derek] Marcus!

30:54.369 --> 30:56.578
- [Marcus] I'm checking, I'm
checking, they don't work.

30:56.578 --> 30:58.201
Like none of the
lights work here.

30:58.201 --> 30:59.581
- [Anna] Excuse me, hello!

30:59.581 --> 31:01.238
- [Derek] There's no power.

31:01.238 --> 31:02.308
- [Marcus] There's nothing.

31:02.308 --> 31:04.621
- [Jocelyn] Oh my God.

31:04.621 --> 31:05.449
It hurts!

31:06.657 --> 31:08.694
- [Nicole] Excuse
me, we need help.

31:08.694 --> 31:10.351
- [Marcus] What the
fuck is all this shit?

31:10.351 --> 31:13.112
- [Nicole] Find like
a light or something.

31:13.112 --> 31:14.355
- [Marcus] I found one, hold on.

31:14.355 --> 31:15.528
- [Nicole] It smells
horrible inside here.

31:15.528 --> 31:16.322
- Yo, Derek.
- Is that a lamp?

31:16.322 --> 31:17.530
- [Derek] Any lights?

31:17.530 --> 31:18.255
- [Nicole] It smells
like my grandma's house

31:18.255 --> 31:19.187
before she died.

31:19.187 --> 31:20.016
- [Patrick] Hello?

31:20.016 --> 31:20.948
- [Anna] Are you okay?

31:20.948 --> 31:22.881
- [Leah] Don't be such a douche.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.192
- [Marcus] We got
light, we got light.

31:24.192 --> 31:25.884
- [Derek] At least
we got a light.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.678
- [Tanya] Can you
bring that over here?

31:27.678 --> 31:29.749
- [Derek] Check her out.

31:29.749 --> 31:32.442
- [Tanya] I think
it's just a bite, huh?

31:32.442 --> 31:33.374
- [Marcus] Hold the camera.

31:33.374 --> 31:34.547
- [Patrick] You'll be okay.

31:34.547 --> 31:35.790
- [Marcus] We got bigger
problems you guys,

31:35.790 --> 31:36.722

in here, how about that?

31:36.722 --> 31:37.930
- [Anna] Something, yeah.

31:37.930 --> 31:38.758

31:39.725 --> 31:41.278
- [Marcus] We'll be fine.

31:41.278 --> 31:42.901
- [Anna] Be careful

31:44.419 --> 31:45.696
- [Derek] Let us check it
out, we'll come get you.

31:45.696 --> 31:46.835
- [Nicole] You can't
go by yourselves.

31:46.835 --> 31:48.078
- [Derek] We'll be back.

31:48.078 --> 31:49.631
- [Tanya] What, you
want to go with them?

31:49.631 --> 31:51.875
- [Nicole] No, but I feel like
we shouldn't let them leave.

31:51.875 --> 31:52.841
- [Tanya] Be careful.

31:52.841 --> 31:53.670
- [Marcus] Guys stay here.

31:53.670 --> 31:54.705
- [Nicole] Be careful.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.776
- [Derek] We'll be fine.

32:00.746 --> 32:03.335
- [Marcus] Dude, this

This is fucking sketch as fuck.

32:06.303 --> 32:10.480

32:14.070 --> 32:15.554
[water splashing]

32:15.554 --> 32:18.039
[tense music]

32:23.872 --> 32:25.115
[sinister laughing]

32:25.115 --> 32:26.047
- [Henry] Well this
is truly the chance

32:26.047 --> 32:27.497
of a lifetime right here boys.

32:27.497 --> 32:28.947
- [Hank] Help daddy,
Otis, help daddy.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.776
You think them college
girls are going to like me?

32:30.776 --> 32:32.191
[Henry laughs]

32:32.191 --> 32:33.434
You think them college
girls are going to like me?

32:33.434 --> 32:34.918
- Yeah, they gonna get
a kick out of you, son.

32:34.918 --> 32:36.402
- [Hank] They probably ain't
met no boy like me, huh?

32:36.402 --> 32:38.025
- [Henry] I don't think
we'll ever outdo this one.

32:38.025 --> 32:39.543
How can you have ten?

32:39.543 --> 32:42.374
- [Hank] Daddy, I've got
to say, I'm quite excited.

32:42.374 --> 32:44.583
- [Henry] They was
sure I was dead.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.688
They even felt me you
know and everything.

32:46.688 --> 32:48.483
I got them good, good.

32:48.483 --> 32:49.968
- [Hank] Daddy, you
got 'em real good.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.039
You need to teach me that
one these days, daddy.

32:52.039 --> 32:53.626
I want to be able to
fake a heart attack.

32:53.626 --> 32:55.007
- [Henry] Experience son,
experience, you'll learn,

32:55.007 --> 32:56.284
you'll learn.

32:56.284 --> 32:57.596
- [Hank] Yes sir, yes
sir, I figure, I figure.

32:57.596 --> 32:59.218
We can slice 'em and
dice 'em real nice.

32:59.218 --> 33:01.082
- [Henry] All that
begging and pleading.

33:01.082 --> 33:03.636
- You think they're gonna
be begging and pleading?

33:03.636 --> 33:07.709
- [Henry] Oh yeah, they're
gonna be trying to buy us off.

33:07.709 --> 33:11.023
- Dude, all of all the places
we could have got stuck,

33:11.023 --> 33:12.852
the fucking Everglades.

33:12.852 --> 33:13.922
This is nice.

33:15.062 --> 33:16.546
- [Derek] What the fuck is that?

33:16.546 --> 33:17.374
- What?

33:23.035 --> 33:24.588
[clicks tongue]
Don't to that to me.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.211
- [Nicole] Yes, we should
have stayed at the beach.

33:26.211 --> 33:27.143
- [Tanya] No shit.

33:27.143 --> 33:28.627
- [Tyler] Yeah, no fucking shit.

33:28.627 --> 33:29.628
- Who's gonna help us
with that boat back there?

33:29.628 --> 33:30.422
- [Tanya] It was
your idea Tyler.

33:30.422 --> 33:31.423
- [Tyler] Fuck you.

33:31.423 --> 33:32.596
- [Toni] You were all about it.

33:32.596 --> 33:34.012
- [Anna] Leave him alone.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.323
[yelling over each other]

33:35.323 --> 33:38.326
- [Nicole] Guys
stop, stop fighting!

33:39.810 --> 33:42.503
- [Marcus] Don't need this
shit in my life right now.

33:42.503 --> 33:45.644
- [Derek] What the fuck
is Tyler's problem?

33:45.644 --> 33:48.854
I thought he was
going to kill me.

33:48.854 --> 33:53.031
- [Marcus] I wanted to do it,
but I love you too much, bro.

33:57.311 --> 33:58.312
- [Derek] He's a prick.

33:58.312 --> 33:59.589
- [Marcus] It's whatever, dude.

33:59.589 --> 34:00.797
- [Derek] What is
he, on steroids?

34:00.797 --> 34:02.488
- [Marcus] I mean
somebody did just die.

34:02.488 --> 34:04.594
I'm sure he's just
a little ticked off,

34:04.594 --> 34:06.665
that's all, you know him.

34:11.359 --> 34:12.567
Should have got a free shot in

34:12.567 --> 34:14.949
while I was holding
him back though.

34:14.949 --> 34:17.123
It's probably the last shot
you would have got on him.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.608
- [Derek] If I wasn't held down.

34:18.608 --> 34:22.335
- [Marcus] Weren't the
females holding you down?

34:24.096 --> 34:26.512
Dude, what the fuck is this?

34:27.996 --> 34:29.860
- [Derek] You see that?

34:29.860 --> 34:31.516
- Yeah.

34:31.516 --> 34:34.279
I'm hoping it's
what I think it is.

34:34.279 --> 34:37.282
Oh shit dude, a
fucking generator.

34:37.282 --> 34:39.353
- [Derek] Fuck yes,
let's crank it up.

34:39.353 --> 34:41.043
- [Marcus] Shit.

34:41.043 --> 34:42.286
Here, hold this.

34:42.286 --> 34:45.428
- [Derek] Let me put this down.

34:45.428 --> 34:48.603
- [Marcus] Let me
get a light up here.

34:49.431 --> 34:50.260
This is bone dry, dude.

34:50.260 --> 34:51.536
- Does it work?

34:51.536 --> 34:52.366
- [Marcus] There's
nothing in it.

34:52.366 --> 34:53.918
- Fuck.

34:53.918 --> 34:56.922
- [Marcus] Let's
just keep looking.

34:58.026 --> 35:01.961
- [Derek] Dude,
there's one over here.

35:01.961 --> 35:03.135
- [Marcus] I'm gonna be
honest, I don't even know

35:03.135 --> 35:04.688
what the fuck I'm
looking at right now.

35:04.688 --> 35:05.517
I don't know.

35:05.517 --> 35:06.690
- [Derek] I don't know.

35:06.690 --> 35:07.967
- [Marcus] There's
gotta be something else.

35:07.967 --> 35:09.452
Fuck that shit.

35:09.452 --> 35:12.179
- [Derek] Dude, there's a
wire that goes in there.

35:12.179 --> 35:13.525
It's got a lock.

35:14.836 --> 35:15.665
- [Marcus] On the handle.

35:15.665 --> 35:17.563
- [Derek] Hell yeah.

35:17.563 --> 35:18.599
- [Marcus] Ha, ha, check it.

35:18.599 --> 35:21.119
- [Derek] Anything in here?

35:21.119 --> 35:23.776
- [Marcus] Oh dude, another one.

35:26.365 --> 35:28.333
This one's electric.

35:28.333 --> 35:29.161
What the?

35:29.161 --> 35:31.577
[metal clanking]

35:31.577 --> 35:33.545
- Does it work?

35:33.545 --> 35:34.477
- Oh my God.
- Jesus.

35:34.477 --> 35:35.754
- I hope they come back soon.

35:35.754 --> 35:36.962
- [Leah] Are you okay?

35:36.962 --> 35:38.860
- [Tanya] They've
been gone for so long.

35:38.860 --> 35:40.345
- [Jocelyn] I hurt really bad.

35:40.345 --> 35:42.623
- [Nicole] Do you think we
should go check on them?

35:42.623 --> 35:44.142
I don't know.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.143
- [Anna] Shit yes!

35:45.143 --> 35:46.074
- [Group] Yes!

35:46.074 --> 35:46.903
[group groans]

35:46.903 --> 35:47.731
- [Anna] Wait.

35:47.731 --> 35:48.560
- [Group] Yes!

35:48.560 --> 35:49.388
- [Anna] Derek!

35:49.388 --> 35:50.217
- [Toni] What?

35:50.217 --> 35:51.079
- [Tanya] Marcus?

35:51.079 --> 35:51.908
- [Nicole] Oh my god.

35:51.908 --> 35:52.840
That had it.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.255
- [Anna] That was them right?

35:54.255 --> 35:55.670
- [Marcus] Shit.

35:56.844 --> 35:58.017
- [Derek] Does it work?

35:58.017 --> 35:59.398
[generator humming]

35:59.398 --> 36:00.779
- [Derek] Oh, we got light.

36:00.779 --> 36:03.954
- [Marcus] Yes,
something's going right.

36:03.954 --> 36:07.613
Come on, let's go check
on everybody else.

36:07.613 --> 36:08.994
- [Anna] No, no, okay.

36:08.994 --> 36:09.822
[group cheers]

36:09.822 --> 36:11.790
[group applauds]

36:11.790 --> 36:13.240
- [Tanya] Marcus

36:13.240 --> 36:14.586
- [Nicole] Alright, maybe
there is a generator.

36:14.586 --> 36:16.104
- [Tyler] Alright, can you stop.

36:16.104 --> 36:17.036
Can everybody stop losing
their fucking shit now.

36:17.036 --> 36:18.935
- [Nicole] Shut up Tyler.

36:18.935 --> 36:19.763
- [Tyler] Fuck off.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.869
- [Nicole] I'm over you.

36:22.973 --> 36:26.149
- [Marcus] Yo, you
should go in without me.

36:26.149 --> 36:27.599
Just be like, I don't know
what happened to Marcus.

36:27.599 --> 36:29.497
- I don't know what
happened to him, I lost him.

36:29.497 --> 36:31.292
- [Marcus] He fell off
the bridge or some shit,

36:31.292 --> 36:32.362
I don't know.

36:33.639 --> 36:34.882
- [Henry] Yeah, well
it looks like they got

36:34.882 --> 36:36.401
that generator cranked, yes.

36:36.401 --> 36:37.574
- [Hank] They found
that generator.

36:37.574 --> 36:38.506
I didn't think
those city slickers

36:38.506 --> 36:40.405
knew what a generator was.

36:41.544 --> 36:42.993
- [Henry] It's work
once you get everything

36:42.993 --> 36:44.892
the way you want, you
know, you have your fun,

36:44.892 --> 36:46.169
why you come get me
a little bit later

36:46.169 --> 36:48.206
and we'll finish it up, okay?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.932
- [Hank] I'm a leave one
real special for you daddy.

36:50.932 --> 36:53.556
- [Henry] Son, I've
always appreciated that.

36:53.556 --> 36:55.005
- [Hank] Yeah daddy.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.490
- [Henry] I taught you
well, now don't fuck it up.

36:56.490 --> 36:57.491
- [Hank] I won't
fuck it up daddy.

36:57.491 --> 36:59.078
- [Henry] Okay.

36:59.078 --> 37:00.908
- [Hank] So it's a bunch
of college kids, huh?

37:00.908 --> 37:04.843
- [Henry] Yep, sure
is, well they were.

37:04.843 --> 37:07.777
- [Hank] I've never
done experienced no
spring break, but.

37:07.777 --> 37:09.296
[laughing]

37:09.296 --> 37:10.849
- [Otis] I don't
understand why they think

37:10.849 --> 37:13.196
they need a break
from spring, daddy.

37:13.196 --> 37:14.853
That's the best season
ever and they think

37:14.853 --> 37:15.785
they need a break from it.

37:15.785 --> 37:17.545
I don't understand all that

37:17.545 --> 37:20.962
- [Henry] Well, it's called
education, educated idiots,

37:20.962 --> 37:22.654
is what I call them.

37:22.654 --> 37:24.138
Educated idiots!

37:24.138 --> 37:25.104
- [Hank] You ain't
lying about that, daddy.

37:25.104 --> 37:27.106
- [Otis] Amen.

37:27.106 --> 37:28.487
- [Marcus] Whoa.

37:28.487 --> 37:29.661
- [Derek] Whoa.

37:29.661 --> 37:31.732
- Derek, we are in
probably the last place

37:31.732 --> 37:33.941
we are ever gonna
see because I doubt

37:33.941 --> 37:36.357
that busted ass boat
got a GPS on it.

37:36.357 --> 37:37.220
So.

37:39.118 --> 37:41.776
- [Derek] Someone will
come for us tomorrow,

37:41.776 --> 37:44.262
all we gotta do
is last the night.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.401
- Yeah, let's hope.

37:45.401 --> 37:46.609
- [Derek] We'll figure
it out tomorrow.

37:46.609 --> 37:47.713
- Find some flares,
set this bitch on fire,

37:47.713 --> 37:49.819
and hope that they see the fire.

37:49.819 --> 37:50.647
That's my vote.

37:50.647 --> 37:52.580
- [Derek] That'd work.

37:52.580 --> 37:54.858
- [Nicole] I don't know, I
still am worried about them.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.722
- [Tanya] Yeah.

37:56.722 --> 37:57.551
- [Jocelyn] Did you
guys get it all?

37:57.551 --> 37:58.793
- [Toni] I know.

37:58.793 --> 37:59.587
- [Tyler] They'll
be back in a second.

37:59.587 --> 38:00.519
- [Tanya] Marcus.

38:00.519 --> 38:01.796
- [Jocelyn] This is sickening.

38:01.796 --> 38:02.590
- Hey are we taking
our clothes off now?

38:02.590 --> 38:04.074
- It's too gross.

38:04.074 --> 38:04.868
- [Nicole] Ugh, I know I
am really wet, I need like.

38:04.868 --> 38:06.111
- [Toni] Oh my god.

38:06.111 --> 38:06.939
- [Marcus] What do
we have here Senor.

38:06.939 --> 38:08.182
- Best thing I ever did.

38:08.182 --> 38:09.770
- [Marcus] Did you
just save our lives?

38:09.770 --> 38:12.807
- I put this in a
water proof container.

38:12.807 --> 38:14.775
- [Marcus] Medication you are.

38:14.775 --> 38:16.121
- Everybody needs this.

38:16.121 --> 38:18.226
- [Tyler] You gonna
let Tyler smoke too?

38:18.226 --> 38:20.953
- I don't know
dude, at this point,

38:20.953 --> 38:22.645
I think it might help.

38:22.645 --> 38:24.163
He's such a bro.

38:24.163 --> 38:27.305
- Like are you a pussy
or are you a bro.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.168
- I know, I can't believe
he said that shit.

38:29.168 --> 38:31.239
It's like he has 'roid rage.

38:31.239 --> 38:32.827
- [Marcus] I think,
maybe he is, like I just.

38:32.827 --> 38:34.070
- [Derek] I don't know,
he's fucking jacked now.

38:34.070 --> 38:35.002
He wasn't like that
when I first met him.

38:35.002 --> 38:36.244
- He's a big ass white dude.

38:36.244 --> 38:39.351
- The jeans are the
worst, oh my god.

38:39.351 --> 38:43.907
Oh my god, I'm so happy
that there's lights though.

38:43.907 --> 38:48.049
- [Tanya] It's not his
fault, I really didn't know.

38:48.049 --> 38:51.087
- [Toni] You think there's
like a, like a, like a hose

38:51.087 --> 38:52.502
or a shower, shower here?

38:52.502 --> 38:53.745
- [Tyler] Oh man.

38:53.745 --> 38:55.125
- [Nicole] What is it,
I would not sniff things

38:55.125 --> 38:57.680
that you don't
know what they are.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.337
Don't sniff it, if you
don't know what it is.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.442
- Oh, I know what
exactly what this is.

39:01.442 --> 39:03.133
- Oh shit.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.481
- [Marcus] Why are they
even allowed to be this big?

39:05.481 --> 39:07.862
- [Derek] Why are we,
look how big it is.

39:07.862 --> 39:10.520
- [Marcus] Dude, why
the fuck is that even,

39:10.520 --> 39:13.420
how the fuck does
that shit even fly?

39:13.420 --> 39:14.524
Dude, fuck that mosquito.

39:14.524 --> 39:15.767
- [Derek] Oh my god.

39:15.767 --> 39:16.561
- [Marcus] I hope that
son of a bitch dies.

39:16.561 --> 39:17.424
We should kill him now.

39:17.424 --> 39:18.701
- [Derek] We need to.

39:18.701 --> 39:19.633
- [Marcus] You got
a lighter on you?

39:19.633 --> 39:20.565
Let's burn this motherfucker.

39:20.565 --> 39:22.083
- [Derek] We need to get inside.

39:22.083 --> 39:23.706
- [Marcus] This shit needs
to get exorcized and killed.

39:23.706 --> 39:26.018
- [Derek] Dude there's
bugs everywhere.

39:26.018 --> 39:27.917
- [Marcus] It's not cool at all.

39:27.917 --> 39:30.264
So much, woo, woo, woo.

39:30.264 --> 39:31.230
- [Derek] Whoa.

39:31.230 --> 39:32.162
- [Marcus] Why'd you do that?

39:32.162 --> 39:32.887
- [Tanya] There they are.

39:32.887 --> 39:33.716
There's my baby!

39:33.716 --> 39:34.544
- [Anna] Hey guys.

39:34.544 --> 39:35.476
- [Toni] What is that?

39:35.476 --> 39:36.408
- [Tyler] White lightning baby.

39:36.408 --> 39:37.685
- [Toni] Are you serious?

39:37.685 --> 39:38.928
- [Anna] Thank you for
putting on the power.

39:38.928 --> 39:39.722
- [Marcus] Who are
the fucking champs?

39:39.722 --> 39:40.654
- [Tanya] You are.

39:40.654 --> 39:41.448
- [Tyler] Oh, I'm serious.

39:41.448 --> 39:42.276
- [Toni] Oh fuck.

39:42.276 --> 39:43.519
- [Derek] Power's on.

39:43.519 --> 39:44.347
- [Nicole] We were like
yelling because you guys

39:44.347 --> 39:46.038
were stressing us out.

39:46.038 --> 39:47.246
- [Marcus] Hey Patrick man.

39:47.246 --> 39:48.731
- [Derek] Where'd you get that?

39:48.731 --> 39:50.146
- [Patrick] Right there.

39:50.146 --> 39:51.665
- [Derek] That's something,
I need some of this.

39:51.665 --> 39:52.907
- [Marcus] Be
careful, be careful.

39:52.907 --> 39:54.150
Give it here, give it
here, give it here.

39:54.150 --> 39:55.600
- [Nicole] What's
all back there?

39:55.600 --> 39:56.808
What's back there? What does
it look like back there?

39:56.808 --> 39:57.602
- [Toni] That smells
like potent, that smells

39:57.602 --> 39:58.534
like, like strong.

39:58.534 --> 39:59.362
- [Derek] Oh what is this?

39:59.362 --> 40:00.156
It's like gasoline.

40:00.156 --> 40:00.950
- [Patrick] It's better.

40:00.950 --> 40:01.744
- [Nicole] Ew, no.

40:01.744 --> 40:03.159
- [Tyler] For men only.

40:03.159 --> 40:04.643
- [Nicole] No, that's
moonshine, that is disgusting.

40:04.643 --> 40:05.575
- [Tanya] Wait guys, are
we sure nobody lives here?

40:05.575 --> 40:06.576
That's a shit ton of moonshine.

40:06.576 --> 40:07.405
- I know.
- Holy shit.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.923
- [Tyler] Oh shit.

40:08.923 --> 40:10.131
- [Marcus] It looks like
we're living here for now.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.409
- [Nicole] Very
true, I don't know.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.789
- [Tyler] There's a shit
ton more down here too.

40:12.789 --> 40:14.204
- There's a lot of things.
- Babe, slow down.

40:14.204 --> 40:17.104
- [Tyler] Spring break 2015!

40:17.104 --> 40:19.313
[cheering]

40:19.313 --> 40:20.487
- [Marcus] I don't want
this shit right now.

40:20.487 --> 40:22.005
- [Toni] I mean, I
don't want this shit.

40:22.005 --> 40:24.249
You take the rest of this.

40:27.217 --> 40:28.046
- [Hank] Turn off your light.

40:28.046 --> 40:29.323
Turn your light off.

40:29.323 --> 40:30.428
They can see.

40:31.290 --> 40:32.533
Turn your light off.

40:32.533 --> 40:33.465
- [Otis] I'm getting
it, I'm getting it.

40:33.465 --> 40:34.293
- [Hank] Turn your light off!!

40:34.293 --> 40:36.261
- [Otis] I'm getting it.

40:36.261 --> 40:37.504
- [Hank] Come on.

40:37.504 --> 40:39.022
- [Otis] It's got
like three switches.

40:39.022 --> 40:39.851
- [Toni] Does anyone else
feel like a rinse off?

40:39.851 --> 40:41.369
- [Nicole] I know.

40:41.369 --> 40:42.647
How can we, okay wait, if
there's moonshine here though,

40:42.647 --> 40:43.924
how do we know someone
doesn't live out here?

40:43.924 --> 40:44.890
- [Toni] I mean,
if there's power,

40:44.890 --> 40:46.167
there's probably running water.

40:46.167 --> 40:47.134
So I feel like you know,
it can't hurt to look.

40:47.134 --> 40:49.067
- Watch somebody crashes here,

40:49.067 --> 40:51.207
it's a fucking hunting
camp or some shit.

40:51.207 --> 40:54.452
- Hey everybody, I know
I kind a fucked up today.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.694
- [Tyler] Yeah, no fucking shit.

40:55.694 --> 40:57.006
- But at least I
did one thing right.

40:57.006 --> 40:57.834
- [Tanya] Yeah!

40:57.834 --> 40:59.491
[cheering]

40:59.491 --> 41:00.319
- [Anna] Now it's a party.

41:00.319 --> 41:01.251
- Waterproof.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.460
- Well where did you get that?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.288
- [Tanya] Oh my
God yes, you win!

41:03.288 --> 41:04.496
I still hate you.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.152
- Let's roll one up,
anyone got papers?

41:05.152 --> 41:06.567
Oh.

41:06.567 --> 41:07.430
- No.

41:07.430 --> 41:08.258
- Ah no.

41:08.258 --> 41:09.501
- All our shit's here.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.709
- [Marcus] I was just
ass deep in water, so.

41:10.709 --> 41:11.641
- [Patrick] Anybody
have them in their bag?

41:11.641 --> 41:12.331
- [Tanya] Do we have apples?

41:12.331 --> 41:13.125
Do we have foil?

41:13.125 --> 41:13.781
Do we have anything?

41:13.781 --> 41:16.266
[menacing music]

41:44.605 --> 41:45.572
- [Nicole] You're gonna
have enough for the buzz.

41:45.572 --> 41:46.883
- I'll take one if you take one.

41:46.883 --> 41:47.884
- Oh shit I have the
papers, wait, wait,

41:47.884 --> 41:49.990
I forgot, I forgot, yeah.

41:51.094 --> 41:51.992
I forgot I had them.

41:51.992 --> 41:53.303
- Ewww, it was horrible.

41:53.303 --> 41:55.651
- I hope their not
soaking wet and ruined.

41:55.651 --> 41:58.550
- [Tanya] Everyone, make
their prayers to the gods.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.034
- Hey, can we go outside
and get fresh air?

42:00.034 --> 42:00.828
- No they're good, they're
good, they're good.

42:00.828 --> 42:01.519
We got it, I got it.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.727
- [Tanya] Yes!

42:02.727 --> 42:06.282
- Aw yeah, a little
janky, but it will work.

42:06.282 --> 42:07.697
- [Toni] Oh yeah you
can make it work.

42:07.697 --> 42:08.905
- I usually complain
about dollar store papers,

42:08.905 --> 42:10.182
but since were in the
middle of nowhere,

42:10.182 --> 42:11.114
I'll just be happy.

42:11.114 --> 42:12.081
- I really want to smoke.

42:12.081 --> 42:13.427
- I feel really sick right now.

42:13.427 --> 42:14.359
- You do?

42:14.359 --> 42:17.189
[group talking over each other]

42:17.189 --> 42:19.778
- [Derek] Oh, we got 'em?

42:19.778 --> 42:21.159
- I really need some fresh air.

42:21.159 --> 42:22.712
- [Anna] Wait the
girls don't feel well.

42:22.712 --> 42:24.024
I think they should
go outside for a bit.

42:24.024 --> 42:25.232
- [Patrick] You guys okay?

42:25.232 --> 42:26.474
- Yeah, I have a
really bad headache.

42:26.474 --> 42:27.406
- [Nicole] Yeah,
maybe you should.

42:27.406 --> 42:28.615
- I feel really light headed.

42:28.615 --> 42:29.547
- [Nicole] That's
fine, get some air.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.513
- [Jocelyn] Is that okay?

42:30.513 --> 42:31.997
- [Nicole] There's like a swing.

42:31.997 --> 42:32.929
- [Anna] I mean don't, don't
go far go right out here.

42:32.929 --> 42:33.861
- [Toni] Just stay in the front.

42:33.861 --> 42:35.414
Just stay where we can see you.

42:35.414 --> 42:36.726
- Yeah, you guys walked around,

42:36.726 --> 42:38.348
it was fine out
there, wasn't it?

42:38.348 --> 42:39.280
- [Toni] Yeah it's safe.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.765
- [Patrick] Just don't go far.

42:40.765 --> 42:41.593
- [Anna] Look together,
and don't go too far out.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.112
Right out the door.

42:43.112 --> 42:44.354
- [Derek] As long as we
can see you, you're fine.

42:44.354 --> 42:46.943
- [Jocelyn] Yo, chill on
the moonshine, really.

42:46.943 --> 42:48.738
- [Tyler] Chill on the
fucking moonshine, go inside.

42:48.738 --> 42:50.809
[group talking over each other]

42:50.809 --> 42:51.638
- [Marcus] Go get
your fresh air.

42:51.638 --> 42:53.674
- [Tyler] Get outside.

42:53.674 --> 42:55.124
- [Tanya] We all did
what we had to do.

42:55.124 --> 42:58.196
- [Nicole] Holler if you
need us okay, just yell,

42:58.196 --> 42:59.887
we won't be far.

42:59.887 --> 43:00.681
Don't go far

43:00.681 --> 43:02.959
- [Leah] We won't.

43:02.959 --> 43:05.686
[haunting music]

43:24.187 --> 43:26.051
- [Jocelyn] I feel so sick.

43:26.051 --> 43:27.605
- [Leah] I'm sorry.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.054
How does it feel?

43:31.436 --> 43:34.646
- I just really want to go home.

43:34.646 --> 43:37.235
I didn't even want to come
here in the first place.

43:37.235 --> 43:39.340
- I know, it's
kinda of my fault.

43:39.340 --> 43:40.548
I thought it was a good idea.

43:40.548 --> 43:42.033
- I've been begging
this whole time,

43:42.033 --> 43:45.312
like this whole snake thing
is so dumb, now look at them.

43:45.312 --> 43:47.141
- How did you do that?

43:47.141 --> 43:48.073
- [Marcus] Drink it.

43:48.073 --> 43:48.798
- [Derek] Isn't it beautiful?

43:48.798 --> 43:50.041
- [Tanya] Hey!

43:50.041 --> 43:51.318
- [Toni] How did you fit
all of that in there?

43:51.318 --> 43:53.838
- [Nicole] I don't even
smoke, but after today,

43:53.838 --> 43:55.253
I think I might.

43:55.253 --> 43:56.219
- [Anna] Yeah, you
have to try it.

43:56.219 --> 43:57.669
- [Nicole] I think I'm going to.

43:57.669 --> 43:59.153
I don't really though.

43:59.153 --> 44:00.189
- [Tyler] Hey yo, so who
brought the tunes by the way?

44:00.189 --> 44:00.983
Who brought those off the boat?

44:00.983 --> 44:01.915
Anybody have that idea?

44:01.915 --> 44:03.468
- [Anna] Yes, who has music?

44:03.468 --> 44:04.262
- [Marcus] I'd rather not use
my last three percent battery,

44:04.262 --> 44:05.712
you know seriously.

44:05.712 --> 44:07.265
- Yeah I have a music library,
but I'm not using my last.

44:07.265 --> 44:09.647
- [Tyler] Fuck it dude, we'll
be rescued tomorrow, alright.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.751
Who's got the music?

44:10.751 --> 44:11.994
- [Marcus] We
weren't even supposed

44:11.994 --> 44:13.547
to be out here in
the first place.

44:13.547 --> 44:16.101
- [Tanya] My phone's in
that disgusting water, so.

44:16.101 --> 44:17.033
- [Anna] You lost your phone?

44:17.033 --> 44:18.310
- [Tanya] No music for y'all.

44:18.310 --> 44:19.139
- [Toni] Oh wow!

44:19.139 --> 44:20.416
- [Marcus] Oh boy!

44:20.416 --> 44:22.660
- [Anna] Where'd Toni go?

44:22.660 --> 44:23.591
- [Toni] Oh my god.

44:23.591 --> 44:24.903
- [Anna] Oh hey, look at Toni.

44:24.903 --> 44:26.664
- [Marcus] Yeah!

44:26.664 --> 44:28.735
- So badass right now.

44:28.735 --> 44:31.254
- [Tanya] Is that a blast
from the past or what?

44:31.254 --> 44:34.292
Is that ghetto blaster
gonna play us some tunes?

44:34.292 --> 44:35.224
- [Marcus] Seriously.

44:35.224 --> 44:36.466
- [Toni] It's for satellite.

44:36.466 --> 44:38.089
- [Tyler] Come on man,
spark that up, brother.

44:38.089 --> 44:39.297
- [Marcus] Oh.

44:39.297 --> 44:40.539
- [Derek] Alright, alright.

44:40.539 --> 44:42.921
- [Marcus] This shit,
are you fucking serious?

44:53.138 --> 44:54.139
- Yes, yes.

44:54.139 --> 44:56.038
- [Tanya] I'll live with it.

44:56.038 --> 44:58.557
- No, I think that's perfect.

45:00.974 --> 45:04.978
- [Tanya] You know what,
everything sounds good.

45:06.151 --> 45:08.533
- [Nicole] Are you
gonna steal it?

45:08.533 --> 45:10.086

45:11.191 --> 45:13.365
- We got white lightning.

45:16.852 --> 45:17.991
- [Anna] Look at the stray cat.

45:17.991 --> 45:19.509
- [Marcus] Shotgun.

45:19.509 --> 45:21.926
- [Nicole And Tanya] Shotgun!

45:24.963 --> 45:26.793
- We have a volunteer.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.278
- [Derek] Shotgun.

45:33.938 --> 45:36.941
- [Nicole] I don't know
what I'm letting happen.

[group whoops suggestively]

45:43.948 --> 45:46.295

them being like that.

45:52.922 --> 45:54.786
They're getting drunk
and being so dumb.

45:54.786 --> 45:57.168
I just can't handle it.

45:57.168 --> 45:59.239
This is literally the
worst spring break ever.

46:01.689 --> 46:02.967
It'll be fine, we have this
whole place to ourselves.

46:02.967 --> 46:04.071
It'll be fun.

46:05.003 --> 46:06.211
Definitely.

46:06.211 --> 46:08.075
- Like I really just
want to go home already.

46:08.075 --> 46:10.284
- We can go home,
we'll get help soon.

46:10.284 --> 46:12.045
It'll be good, we'll be fine,

46:12.045 --> 46:14.668
we'll come to enjoy
it, we'll be fine.

a shower or anything?

47:20.734 --> 47:22.632
looked good out there, right?

47:22.632 --> 47:24.048

a hose, it's a hose.

were in the fucking Everglades.

47:24.980 --> 47:25.843
- I know.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.292
- It's not a shower.

- [Toni] You understand
what your working with, yes?

47:28.811 --> 47:30.675
- [Marcus] Like we just
walked through swamp water

47:30.675 --> 47:32.504
to get here, I mean.

47:32.504 --> 47:34.092

don't go with her?

47:44.413 --> 47:46.242
- [Toni] I'm getting like
secondhand high right now.

47:46.242 --> 47:48.072
I don't wanna be high.

47:49.867 --> 47:53.422
- [Nicole] Where'd
they say that hose was?

47:53.422 --> 47:55.182
- [Patrick] I think
it was over here.

47:55.182 --> 47:56.011
- Where?

47:57.978 --> 48:00.705
Oh. It's gonna be so cold.

48:00.705 --> 48:02.396
Well wait hold on.

48:02.396 --> 48:04.951
This kinda looks like a shower.

48:06.090 --> 48:07.781
Um.

48:07.781 --> 48:11.233
- [Patrick] That
looks like it works.

48:11.233 --> 48:12.406
Look at this.

48:13.614 --> 48:14.546
- Oh, yeah.

48:16.928 --> 48:17.895
Alright.

but you can't watch me.

Fuck, this is a bad idea too.

Oh my god.

It's so cold.

I wish I had soap.

Stay turned around.

49:07.841 --> 49:10.430
I can barely hear you
with all this water.

- So I've never been
outside in the shower

girl as yourself.

where we could sleep?

49:41.392 --> 49:43.152
- [Marcus] I know exactly
where we can sleep.

49:43.152 --> 49:44.947

that one before.

49:44.947 --> 49:45.879
- [Anna] So tired.

a snake alright.

50:04.035 --> 50:06.072

50:22.295 --> 50:23.848
- [Nicole] Stop!

50:23.848 --> 50:24.918
- [Tanya] Come on, you're
showering out in the open.

50:24.918 --> 50:25.850
What do you expect?

50:25.850 --> 50:27.265
- [Marcus] That was priceless.

50:27.265 --> 50:28.784

Ha, it works.

50:47.561 --> 50:50.219
[lips smacking]

50:51.807 --> 50:53.878
- [Tanya] What is with
all the fucking plastic?

50:53.878 --> 50:56.053
It looks like a crime scene.

50:56.053 --> 50:58.055
Mm, it's everywhere.

50:58.055 --> 51:02.438
- [Marcus] I don't know about
crime scene, but I mean.

51:02.438 --> 51:03.267
We can make one.

51:03.267 --> 51:05.924
[lips smacking]

51:05.924 --> 51:07.719
It's kinda hot though right?

51:40.511 --> 51:43.169
[Tanya moaning]

51:56.113 --> 51:58.563
- Oh, this was the best idea.

51:58.563 --> 52:00.427
You better not be looking at me.

52:00.427 --> 52:01.842
- [Patrick] I'm not.

52:01.842 --> 52:05.812
- [Nicole] Alright, stay
turned around, I'm almost done.

52:07.641 --> 52:10.886
It's so hard to hear
you over the shower.

You better not be looking at me.

52:21.552 --> 52:23.761
[muffled shouting]

52:23.761 --> 52:25.314
- What did you say?

52:27.144 --> 52:28.455
I seriously can't hear anything

52:28.455 --> 52:30.975
over the frogs and the shower.

52:35.117 --> 52:38.465
Alright, you can
turn around now.

52:38.465 --> 52:39.294
Patrick.

52:41.503 --> 52:42.331
Patrick.

52:45.231 --> 52:46.093
Seriously.

52:47.233 --> 52:48.510
Patrick where are you?

52:48.510 --> 52:49.752
I need a towel.

53:00.349 --> 53:03.180
[engine rumbling]

53:04.871 --> 53:06.252
- [Tanya] I wish I could go pee.

53:06.252 --> 53:08.150

53:08.150 --> 53:08.978
Oh shit.

The fuck?

53:33.865 --> 53:36.765
[foreboding music]

53:52.401 --> 53:54.231
- [Hank] Take a
nice deep breath.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.267
Take a nice deep breath.

53:58.407 --> 53:59.753

Marcus?

55:04.197 --> 55:05.025
Babe?

55:06.372 --> 55:08.477
Hey I can't see anything.

55:09.927 --> 55:12.516
I swear to god, if you plan
on jumping out and scaring me,

55:12.516 --> 55:15.484
you're not getting round two.

55:15.484 --> 55:16.727
Fuck.

55:16.727 --> 55:17.728
[Nicole and Tanya scream]

55:17.728 --> 55:19.316
- Oh my god, you freaked me out.

55:19.316 --> 55:20.765
- [Tanya] I'm sorry,
I thought Marcus was

55:20.765 --> 55:22.146
trying to scare me.

55:22.146 --> 55:24.321
- I can't find Patrick anywhere.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.287
- [Tanya] Did you see Marcus?

55:25.287 --> 55:26.978
- No, but I was in the shower,

55:26.978 --> 55:29.084
and Patrick left me
and I'm soaking wet.

55:29.084 --> 55:30.568
- What a dick.

55:30.568 --> 55:32.674
I think there's a towel in the
bathroom, you want a towel?

55:32.674 --> 55:34.400
- [Nicole] Oh yeah, yes please,
you're like saving my life.

55:34.400 --> 55:37.057

- [Nicole] Oh my god, you're
saving my life right now.

55:39.128 --> 55:40.475
I had to walk outside naked.

55:40.475 --> 55:42.028
I can't believe--

55:42.028 --> 55:42.822
- You should have been in
the wet T- shirt contest,

55:42.822 --> 55:44.306
your boobs look great.

55:44.306 --> 55:44.927
- Oh, shut up, I can't
believe he left me though.

55:44.927 --> 55:45.756
It's so.

55:45.756 --> 55:47.274
- You know what?

55:47.274 --> 55:49.276
I bet Marcus found him and
they're trying to scare us.

55:49.276 --> 55:50.277
- Oh, they're assholes.

55:50.277 --> 55:51.209
- Because he thinks it's funny.

55:51.209 --> 55:52.487

55:52.487 --> 55:53.729
- [Tanya] I don't either.

55:53.729 --> 55:55.524
- I don't understand why
plastic is everywhere.

55:55.524 --> 55:56.836
- It's weird, right?

55:56.836 --> 55:58.113
- Did you hear that?

55:58.113 --> 55:59.356
- I heard that.

55:59.356 --> 56:00.633
Marcus!

56:00.633 --> 56:02.462

56:15.337 --> 56:17.028

56:17.028 --> 56:18.478
- Why are they such assholes?

56:18.478 --> 56:20.756
- Because they have wieners.

[Nicole squeals]

56:23.587 --> 56:25.174
- Marcus!

- [Derek] Glad I brought that.

58:00.822 --> 58:01.616
Holy shit.

58:04.688 --> 58:07.207
I mean, I'm actually
feeling really nauseous.

58:07.207 --> 58:08.346
- Yeah, I think I'm
probably cutting off

58:08.346 --> 58:09.278
the circulation of your legs.

58:09.278 --> 58:10.797
- Yeah, I need a breather.

I'm gonna get some sleep,
I mean, you don't have to,

58:22.775 --> 58:24.017
you can keep
smoking if you want.
