00:03.850 --> 00:05.320
You know who's got to be
the bravest person

00:05.390 --> 00:06.450
in the Marvel Universe?

00:06.450 --> 00:09.720
Whoever has to give
She-Hulk a bikini wax.

00:10.630 --> 00:12.030
You want to talk brave,

00:12.030 --> 00:15.430
how about Captain America's
undocumented Mexican gardener?

00:16.500 --> 00:17.800
He's not braver than

00:17.800 --> 00:20.270
whoever uses the bathroom
after The Thing?

00:21.270 --> 00:23.520
As usual, you're all wrong.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.440
The bravest person
in the Marvel Universe

00:25.440 --> 00:28.680
is the doctor who gives
Wolverine his prostate exam.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.210
How about the guy who gets

00:31.210 --> 00:33.210
a prostate exam from Wolverine?

00:33.210 --> 00:35.450
Now you're just being silly.

00:36.350 --> 00:37.480
Wolverine's never displayed

00:37.490 --> 00:39.050
the slightest interest
in helping others

00:39.050 --> 00:40.820
prevent prostate cancer.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.490
Hello.

00:46.490 --> 00:48.060
Yes, the elevator's
out of order;

00:48.060 --> 00:49.760
you'll have to use the stairs.

00:50.870 --> 00:51.870
Of course you can.

00:51.870 --> 00:54.130
Pizza dates back
to the 16th century,

00:54.140 --> 00:57.500
while the first elevator
was not installed until 1852.

00:57.510 --> 01:00.170
That means that
for over 300 years,

01:00.170 --> 01:02.780
people carried pizzas up stairs.

01:02.780 --> 01:04.879
Be part of that proud tradition.

01:06.550 --> 01:09.880
I'll go get Penny while that guy
spits on our food.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.220
Do you think they gave Wolverine
an adamantium prostate?

01:14.220 --> 01:16.990
That's a stupid question.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.130
We're having
a conversation about

01:18.130 --> 01:20.760
probing the heinies
of superheroes.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.300
There are no stupid questions.

01:29.950 --> 01:30.870
Yes?

01:30.870 --> 01:33.270
Oh, um, is
Penny here?

01:33.270 --> 01:35.240
You're Leonard, right?

01:35.240 --> 01:37.980
Yeah.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.380
Damn, it's good
to finally meet you, son.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.600
Okay, I think a bit of
context here might help.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.690
Oh, hey, Leonard.
I see you met my dad.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.270
Oh, good.

01:47.270 --> 01:48.460
Context.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.690
Come on in, buddy.

01:49.690 --> 01:50.690
Take a load off.

01:50.690 --> 01:52.090
Oh, gee, Dad,
Leonard can't stay.

01:52.090 --> 01:53.560
He just dropped by to say hello.

01:53.560 --> 01:54.590
Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.560
I'll see you later.

01:58.330 --> 01:59.530
Bye.

02:04.340 --> 02:07.120

02:32.800 --> 02:34.820
Are you sure you have
enough comics?

02:34.910 --> 02:37.480
You're going to be monitoring
the telescope for 12 hours,

02:37.480 --> 02:39.380
and by my estimate,
you've only selected

02:39.380 --> 02:41.520
seven hours of reading material.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.190
That's even factoring in

02:43.190 --> 02:45.820
your difficulty in parsing
American comic book idioms

02:45.820 --> 02:48.290
like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

02:48.290 --> 02:50.160
Is that racist?

02:50.160 --> 02:51.790
It feels racist.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.160
Don't be oversensitive.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.170
He's calling <i>you</i> illiterate,
not your race.

02:57.170 --> 03:00.100
Oh, okay. Good.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.470
I don't need
more comics.

03:01.470 --> 03:03.440
Howard's gonna stop by,
we're gonna play

03:03.440 --> 03:06.310
Intergalactic Battleship
and Indian Monopoly.

03:06.310 --> 03:09.080
I don't care for
novelty editions of Monopoly.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.550
I prefer the classics:
regular and Klingon.

03:13.550 --> 03:15.020
Actually, Indian Monopoly's

03:15.020 --> 03:17.250
just like regular,
except the money's in rupees,

03:17.250 --> 03:20.490
instead of hotels
you build call centers,

03:20.490 --> 03:24.190
and when you pick a Chance card,
you might die of dysentery.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.650
Just FYI,

03:26.650 --> 03:27.900
that was racist.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.490
You'll never guess
what just happened.

03:32.490 --> 03:34.170
You went out in the hallway,

03:34.170 --> 03:36.110
stumbled into
an interdimensional portal

03:36.110 --> 03:38.240
which brought you 5,000 years
into the future,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.280
where you took advantage
of the advanced technology

03:40.280 --> 03:42.580
to build a time machine,
and now you're back

03:42.580 --> 03:44.830
to bring us all with you
to the year 7010

03:44.830 --> 03:47.120
where we are transported
to work at the Thinkatorium

03:47.120 --> 03:50.520
by telepathically controlled
flying dolphins?

03:52.160 --> 03:53.720
No.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.460
Aw.

03:56.290 --> 03:58.290
Penny kissed me.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.360
Well, who would ever guess that?

04:01.100 --> 04:02.670
What-what kind of a kiss?

04:02.670 --> 04:04.500
A big kiss. On the mouth.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.870
Is it possible that she was
going for your cheek

04:06.870 --> 04:09.570
and you moved
and she accidentally got lip?

04:09.570 --> 04:13.010
That happens with me and my mom
all the time.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.640
She introduced me to her father,

04:15.650 --> 04:18.149
kissed me and then
shut the door in my face.

04:18.149 --> 04:20.519
Maybe she was trying
to send you a message.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.579
You think?

04:21.589 --> 04:23.040
Yeah.
"This man is not my father.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.520
"I'm being held hostage.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.720
"So I'm going to do

04:25.720 --> 04:27.160
"something insane in the hopes

04:27.160 --> 04:29.260
that you'll call 911."

04:29.260 --> 04:31.060
Penny kissing me is not insane.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.900
She used to kiss me
all the time.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.830
Einstein defined insanity
as "doing the same thing

04:35.830 --> 04:39.200
over and over again and
expecting different results."

04:39.740 --> 04:40.770
By that standard,

04:40.770 --> 04:42.940
Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.560
I'm just saying,

04:45.560 --> 04:47.560
it felt like it may have
meant something.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.350
Ah, this takes me back.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.810
Leonard obsessing about Penny.

04:50.810 --> 04:53.550
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love your new stuff,

04:53.550 --> 04:56.150
but once in a while
it's nice to hear the hits.

04:56.150 --> 04:57.390
Ooh, ooh!

04:57.390 --> 05:01.260
Do "Our babies will be smart
and beautiful."

05:02.590 --> 05:05.440
That one always makes me laugh.

05:07.660 --> 05:09.530
Why do I bother
talking to you people?

05:09.530 --> 05:11.770
If it'll make you feel better,
we rarely listen.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.340
Hey, can I talk to you
out here for a sec?

05:14.340 --> 05:15.600
Yeah, sure.

05:17.110 --> 05:20.410
I'm starting to think we're
never going to see that pizza.

05:21.510 --> 05:23.960
So you're probably wondering
what that was all about.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.980
What, uh, the kissing
and everything?

05:25.980 --> 05:29.440
Nah, women do that to me
all the time.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.270
Yeah, okay.
The thing is, I kind of

05:31.270 --> 05:33.160
told my father
we got back together again.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.120
What? Why?

05:35.130 --> 05:36.260
Well, you're the first guy

05:36.260 --> 05:37.830
he's ever really approved of,
you know?

05:37.830 --> 05:39.280
You're a scientist
who went to college

05:39.280 --> 05:41.000
and you don't have a neck tattoo

05:41.000 --> 05:45.670
or outstanding warrants
or... or a baby.

05:45.670 --> 05:49.370
What kind of guys
did you used to go out with?

05:49.370 --> 05:51.240
Just guys.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.630
Anyway, when I told him
we split up, he was heartbroken,

05:53.630 --> 05:55.280
and he kept bugging me:
"How's Leonard?

05:55.280 --> 05:56.950
"Why can't you get
back together with Leonard?

05:56.950 --> 06:00.170
I bet Leonard never
tipped a cow over on himself."

06:01.280 --> 06:02.640
So to get him off my back,

06:02.640 --> 06:04.220
I told him
we worked things out.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.390
Really?

06:09.690 --> 06:11.990
How-how'd we manage that?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.200
What?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.530
I mean, did you apologize?

06:15.530 --> 06:17.130
Did you have to woo me?

06:18.140 --> 06:20.320
Get over yourself.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.540
I whistled, you came running.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.340
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

06:25.340 --> 06:26.780
Okay, why are you
arguing about this?

06:26.780 --> 06:27.740
I'm just saying,

06:27.740 --> 06:29.180
if we fake got back together,

06:29.180 --> 06:30.910
that's totally not
how it fake happened.

06:30.910 --> 06:31.910
Oh...

06:31.920 --> 06:33.120
Okay, whatever.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.820
Will you please just play along
until my dad leaves?

06:34.820 --> 06:36.370
Hold on, you actually want me

06:36.370 --> 06:38.620
to deceive your father
with some sort of

06:38.620 --> 06:40.160
sham play acting and kissing?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.320
'Cause I'm good with that.

06:43.390 --> 06:45.590
Penny, you out here?

06:51.670 --> 06:53.840
Come on, honey,
not in front of my dad.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.520
Relax, I've seen you do
a lot worse with a lot stupider.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.560
See?

06:59.560 --> 07:00.890
He doesn't mind.

07:00.890 --> 07:02.060
So, Leonard,
I'm taking your gal out

07:02.060 --> 07:03.610
for a steak dinner;
you want to join us?

07:03.610 --> 07:05.700
Oh, Dad, that's nice,
but Leonard has to work.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.620
Right, Leonard?

07:06.620 --> 07:08.120
Uh, I do, I
have to work.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.850
But I'm gonna blow that
off to spend the evening

07:09.850 --> 07:12.190
with my sweetie and her
father, 'cause, you know,

07:12.190 --> 07:13.990
just the kind of
boyfriend I am.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.370
Oh.

07:15.380 --> 07:16.690
Come here, you.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.220
C-7.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.240
Miss.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.440
How could that be a miss?

07:29.440 --> 07:31.210
C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit.

07:31.210 --> 07:33.410
Part of your starship
has to be on C-7.

07:33.410 --> 07:36.050
Not if it has a hole
in the middle.

07:37.810 --> 07:40.850
What kind of spaceship
has a hole in the middle?

07:40.850 --> 07:44.420
A Romulan Battle Bagel?

07:45.890 --> 07:47.760
Knock-knock.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.360
Oh, great, you made it.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.560
Come on in.

07:51.390 --> 07:52.860
I invited her.

07:52.860 --> 07:55.000
So where's
the telescope?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.900
It's in Hawaii, but Raj
controls it from here.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.570
He's hoping to see Epsilon
Eridani dim, which would be

08:00.570 --> 08:03.570
evidence of a planet
orbiting it.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.110
So we just sit and stare
at the screen,

08:05.110 --> 08:06.310
waiting for
something to happen?

08:06.310 --> 08:10.410
I did it with you when
we rented <i>The Notebook.</i>

08:13.180 --> 08:16.790
Yes, Gena Rowlands
is a treasure.

08:16.790 --> 08:19.640
You'd better open up
that bottle of wine

08:19.640 --> 08:23.280
or I'm gonna end up
with swimmer's ear.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.430
Excuse me.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.160
I can't be drinking,
I'm about to make

08:26.160 --> 08:27.930
an important scientific
discovery here.

08:27.930 --> 08:31.100
What? Galileo did his best work
while drinking wine.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.330
How do you know that?

08:32.340 --> 08:33.900
Well, he was Italian.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.570
It's a reasonable assumption.

08:36.570 --> 08:37.940
Dude, can you even
open your mouth

08:37.940 --> 08:39.440
without spewing a
cultural stereotype?

08:39.440 --> 08:42.710
Oh, I-I'm sorry,
Galileo drank Diet Sprite.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.320
Look, you're my best friend,
she's my girlfriend;

08:46.320 --> 08:47.500
you should bond.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.550
You know,
like you and my mom did.

08:49.550 --> 08:52.790
Your mom creeps
the hell out of me.

08:52.790 --> 08:57.190
Yes, but she's stopped
calling you Slumdog Millionaire.

08:57.190 --> 08:58.390
I do appreciate that.

08:59.150 --> 09:01.150
Here we go.

09:01.150 --> 09:03.650
I'd like to propose a toast.

09:03.650 --> 09:05.970
To science and friendship.

09:07.540 --> 09:08.740
Hold on. Wait.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.640
No, it's okay, go ahead.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.710
What?

09:11.710 --> 09:12.840
Oh, I was working with

09:12.840 --> 09:14.680
penicillin-resistant gonorrhea
in the lab today

09:14.680 --> 09:17.580
and I was just trying to
remember if I washed my hands.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.120
Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.490
My pleasure.

09:27.490 --> 09:29.430
It's nice to have dinner
with a boyfriend of Penny's

09:29.430 --> 09:30.760
that knows how to use a napkin.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.030
So not funny, Dad.

09:34.030 --> 09:36.430
Let me tell you about this one
genius she was going out with,

09:36.430 --> 09:37.970
this-this
fella Donnie.

09:37.970 --> 09:39.540
Oh, will you please let it go?

09:39.540 --> 09:41.500
Donnie was gonna make millions
turning farm waste

09:41.500 --> 09:43.610
into biofuel and selling it
to the government.

09:43.610 --> 09:45.310
A lot of people are doing that.

09:45.310 --> 09:46.740
Oh, see?

09:46.740 --> 09:49.030
Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix
pig poop with a little water

09:49.030 --> 09:50.380
and pump it
into his mom's Camry.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
Yeah, that's great.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.250
It's a funny story. Moving on.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.550
And Donnie was a rocket
scientist compared to that boy

09:57.550 --> 09:59.660
who wanted to get beer pong
into the Olympics.

09:59.660 --> 10:00.790
What was his
name, sweetheart?

10:00.790 --> 10:03.260
Curtis, and I'm pretty sure
he was joking.

10:03.260 --> 10:04.190
I don't know.

10:04.190 --> 10:05.590
That petition
looked real to me.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.400
Yeah, okay, I think this ends

10:08.400 --> 10:10.170
the ex-boyfriend portion
of our evening.

10:10.170 --> 10:13.250
Well, I'm just glad you finally
found yourself a keeper.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.570
Thanks, Wyatt.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.940
I'm a keeper.

10:21.610 --> 10:23.480
Leonard, you want to come in
for a nightcap?

10:23.480 --> 10:24.710
Oh, gee, Dad,
he'd love to,

10:24.710 --> 10:26.150
but Leonard has to work
in the morning.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.150
Maybe I could
go in a little late.

10:28.150 --> 10:29.450
No, no, no, you can't.

10:29.450 --> 10:31.220
Your career is
far too important.

10:31.220 --> 10:33.160
Behind every great man
is a nagging woman

10:33.160 --> 10:35.790
who won't let him have any fun,
am I right, Leonard?

10:36.660 --> 10:39.600
Don't I know it.

10:40.910 --> 10:41.900
Well, good night, son.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.130
Good night, Wyatt.

10:43.130 --> 10:44.620
Oh, good
night, honey.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.400
Good night.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.410
I love you.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.290
Love you, too.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:02.120 --> 11:03.690
Oh, friggety-frak.

11:03.690 --> 11:06.090
Not this again.

11:11.080 --> 11:15.370
Three, four, five--
pass go, get 2,000 rupees--

11:15.370 --> 11:17.620
six, seven.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.920
Whoops. Can't go any further.
There's a sacred cow in my way.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.340
Bernadette, please
tell your boyfriend

11:22.340 --> 11:24.160
to cool it with
the cow jokes.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.360
It won't help.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.260
Once he finds a joke he likes,
he sticks with it.

11:27.260 --> 11:28.500
Yeah.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.870
Like his haircut material.

11:29.870 --> 11:32.000
Oh, right.
Did you get your hair cut?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.540
"No. I got them all cut."

11:35.300 --> 11:37.670
Which is still
so funny.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.390
And when you go
to a Chinese restaurant,

11:40.390 --> 11:42.710
he always gets the same fortune
in his fortune cookie.

11:42.710 --> 11:44.350
Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner

11:44.350 --> 11:46.350
in a Chinese
fortune cookie factory."

11:48.350 --> 11:50.450
Okay, I think that's enough
about me.

11:50.450 --> 11:52.850
He's right. Let's make
fun of his mother.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.890
"Howard, come rub my feet!

11:55.890 --> 11:58.590
My corns are killing me!"

11:59.830 --> 12:02.330
"Howard, help me
out of the tub!

12:02.330 --> 12:04.700
I'm stuck again!"

12:08.470 --> 12:10.640
Coming.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.980
Hey, lovebug.

12:15.850 --> 12:17.100
Shut up.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.100
You know what I've been doing
for the last hour?

12:19.100 --> 12:21.750
Mm, dreamily doodling
"Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

12:21.750 --> 12:23.380
in a notebook?

12:23.390 --> 12:25.490
Listening to my father
go on and on

12:25.490 --> 12:26.990
about what a great guy you are.

12:26.990 --> 12:30.290
You got to admit,
I am... I'm delightful.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.600
Why are you making this
so difficult?

12:33.600 --> 12:34.830
It's not difficult for me.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.530
I'm having fun.

12:36.530 --> 12:37.730
Leonard.

12:37.730 --> 12:39.370
What do you want me to do?
You started this.

12:39.370 --> 12:41.370
Do you want to go over
and tell him we're broken up?

12:41.370 --> 12:42.440
No.
Well, then, what do you want?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.640
I don't know.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.040
Don't you think that's something
you should

12:45.040 --> 12:46.640
have figured out
before you stomped over here?

12:46.640 --> 12:49.040
Maybe.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.710
Leonard, Penny, excellent.

12:51.710 --> 12:54.220
I'd like to say I'm very happy
that you're back together,

12:54.220 --> 12:56.750
and if I can figure out
a way to do so

12:56.750 --> 12:59.190
and sound sincere, I will.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.590
In the meantime,

13:00.590 --> 13:02.660
I'd like to go over
some proposed changes

13:02.660 --> 13:04.930
to the roommate agreement
specifically to address

13:04.930 --> 13:06.610
Penny's annoying
personal habits.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.530
Oh, my God.

13:08.530 --> 13:10.950
What personal habits?
I have a list.

13:10.950 --> 13:15.270
FYI, overuse of the phrase
"Oh, my God" is number 12.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.110
Okay, Sheldon,
you don't have to do this

13:18.110 --> 13:19.490
because Leonard and I are not...
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.610
Are you sure you want
to include him in this?

13:21.610 --> 13:23.150
Include me in what?

13:23.150 --> 13:24.710
Is there a plot afoot?

13:24.710 --> 13:27.120
I'll have no
truck with plots.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.550
No, you're right.

13:28.550 --> 13:32.020
No, there's... there's no plots,
no trucks, no feet.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.390
So what other annoying habits
shall we discuss?

13:34.390 --> 13:36.760
Uh, we don't
discuss anything.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.800
Leonard is the signatory
to the roommate agreement.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.560
As such, he bears
responsibility

13:41.560 --> 13:44.470
for all your infractions
and must pay all fines.

13:45.270 --> 13:46.670
Fines?
Yes.

13:46.670 --> 13:48.240
If Penny's going to be
spending nights here again,

13:48.240 --> 13:49.700
you'll need to set up
an escrow account.

13:49.710 --> 13:51.140
Sign here.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.680
Hello, Hawaii.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.150
This is Dr. Koothrappali
in Pasadena.

13:59.150 --> 14:02.480
I'd like you to reposition
the telescope, please.

14:02.490 --> 14:04.890
Scarlett Johansson's house!

14:06.890 --> 14:08.540
I'm kidding, Hawaii.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.460
Mahalo.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.510
Whoo!

14:13.530 --> 14:14.930
It might have
been a mistake

14:14.930 --> 14:16.870
to open that second
bottle of wine.

14:16.870 --> 14:19.170
Well, live and learn.

14:19.170 --> 14:21.670
So, Raj, do you think this
planet you're looking for

14:21.670 --> 14:24.410
could have an atmosphere
that supports life?

14:24.410 --> 14:25.540
Maybe.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.410
If it did, I'd be famous.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.340
I'd be on the cover
of magazines.

14:29.350 --> 14:30.950
And then,
instead of living alone

14:30.950 --> 14:33.280
in my tiny apartment,
I'd have a big mansion.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.750
That sounds great.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.220
It is.

14:36.220 --> 14:38.420
If you like wandering
around a big, empty house

14:38.420 --> 14:41.060
with no one to love you.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.890
We'd come visit you.
No, you wouldn't.

14:44.890 --> 14:48.100
You'd be intimidated
by my wealth and fame.

14:49.070 --> 14:50.100
My only friends would be

14:50.100 --> 14:51.530
my genetically engineered
monkey butler

14:51.530 --> 14:54.900
and the little people I hired
to be my living chess set.

14:56.940 --> 14:59.710
He's taking a turn to
the dark side, isn't he?

14:59.710 --> 15:01.880
Hold on.
He could come back.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.250
Oh, what's the point
of everything?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.680
Nope. He's gone.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.230
You know it's been more
than a year

15:07.230 --> 15:08.480
since I've even kissed a girl?

15:08.480 --> 15:11.570
What about that hookup
at Comic-Con you told me about?

15:11.570 --> 15:12.850
Oh, grow up. I was lying.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.320
I lie all the time.
Nobody wants to kiss me.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.590
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

15:17.590 --> 15:20.500
Raj, you have to know
you're a wonderful man.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.160
There are a lot of girls out
there who'll want to kiss you.

15:23.170 --> 15:25.100
Where?

15:25.100 --> 15:27.070
You just have to look.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.770
No!

15:42.180 --> 15:44.350
Well, this was fun.

15:49.860 --> 15:51.830
Oh! I think
I got a nibble.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.610
Oh, be careful.

15:53.610 --> 15:56.250
Give him some line.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.730
Okay, now reel him in.

15:58.730 --> 16:00.770
Oh, look at that baby.

16:00.770 --> 16:02.270
They're really biting, huh?

16:02.270 --> 16:05.120
Yeah. They do that
when you set it on easy.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.780
Oh, that's me.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.300
Hello.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.580
Oh, hi, sweetie.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.880
Yeah, I got up early
and didn't want to wake you,

16:14.880 --> 16:17.850
so I went out for coffee and ran
into Leonard on the way back.

16:17.850 --> 16:20.590
Guess what-- we're fishing.

16:20.590 --> 16:23.190
Yeah. Right here on his couch.

16:24.010 --> 16:26.230
Hey, baby. I love you!

16:28.030 --> 16:29.760
That's Leonard.

16:29.770 --> 16:32.270
Says he loves you.

16:32.270 --> 16:34.470
What?

16:35.740 --> 16:37.240
I see.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.310
The whole thing's
bull squirt, huh?

16:41.010 --> 16:43.310
Well, that's very disappointing.

16:43.310 --> 16:45.510
Bye.

16:51.550 --> 16:52.950
Oh, hey.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.920
There's been something I've
been meaning to tell you.

16:57.010 --> 16:59.290
I can't believe you would
lie to me like that.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.000
Just for the record, I did not
want to be a part of this.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.260
I'll get to you in a minute.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.230
No hurry.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.329
That my own daughter thinks
I don't love her enough

17:06.339 --> 17:08.190
to support her no matter
what choices she makes--

17:08.190 --> 17:09.270
well, that hurts me deeply.

17:09.270 --> 17:10.510
I'm sorry, Daddy...
Let me finish.

17:10.510 --> 17:11.770
Oh.

17:11.770 --> 17:13.140
I thought we were
past the days

17:13.140 --> 17:15.480
when you would try
to pull the wool over my eyes.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.750
Telling me the baggie in your
underwear drawer is potpourri?

17:19.920 --> 17:21.380
And the pee stick
in your bathroom

17:21.380 --> 17:23.450
is to check for diabetes?

17:27.390 --> 17:29.320
You know, I'm sorry.

17:29.330 --> 17:31.130
You're a grown woman,
and I respect your right

17:31.130 --> 17:32.990
to make your own decisions,
but all I ask

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
is you respect me enough
to be honest about them.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.870
You're right. Look, from now on,
I will tell you the truth.

17:37.870 --> 17:40.050
Thank you. Now, why don't you go
and put some clothes on

17:40.050 --> 17:42.470
and we'll grab a bite to eat
before I head for the airport.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.140
- Now you.
- Daddy, he had nothing to do...

17:44.140 --> 17:45.970
- Keep walking.
- Okay.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.080
Please, please, please
don't give up on her.

17:55.050 --> 17:57.150
What?

17:57.150 --> 17:59.220
I can't go back to the
skateboard idiots,

17:59.220 --> 18:00.820
the white rappers
and all those

18:00.820 --> 18:04.230
sweaty dumb-asses with
their backwards hats.

18:05.230 --> 18:08.230
Gee, I don't know
if it's in the cards, sir.

18:08.230 --> 18:09.730
Then, stack the deck.

18:09.730 --> 18:11.170
Cheat.

18:11.170 --> 18:13.270
Lie. I don't care.

18:13.270 --> 18:14.870
I want grandkids before I die,

18:14.870 --> 18:17.770
and I want them to grow up
in a house without wheels.

18:23.850 --> 18:25.410
I'll give it a shot.

18:25.410 --> 18:27.080
Thank you.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.970
Now I'm going to do something
here to help you along.

18:28.970 --> 18:30.640
Excuse me?
Just don't panic.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.890
Now, get your sorry,
lying ass out of my face

18:33.890 --> 18:36.120
and make sure I
never see it again!

18:36.130 --> 18:38.090
Oh, the reverse psychology
thing.

18:38.090 --> 18:39.560
I see. That's very clever.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.800
Don't yap. Just get out.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.430
I'll friend you on Facebook.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.670
Oh, there you are.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.280
Just so you know,
I was up all night,

18:55.280 --> 18:57.180
but I have finally completed

18:57.180 --> 19:01.020
the Penny-specific section
of the new roommate agreement.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.680
Yeah, well, not necessary.

19:02.690 --> 19:04.450
We broke up again.

19:16.670 --> 19:19.830
Do you even think
about other people, Leonard?

19:21.170 --> 19:23.240
Do you?

19:30.790 --> 19:33.500
- Hey.
- Oh, how'd it go last night?

19:33.560 --> 19:35.680
Oh, you know.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.430
Same old, same old.

19:37.430 --> 19:39.260
Looked through a telescope,
saw some stars.

19:39.270 --> 19:40.680
Big whoop.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.870
Really?

19:41.870 --> 19:43.350
You waited months
for time with that telescope.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.490
What happened?

19:44.490 --> 19:47.070
Why? You writing a book?

19:47.070 --> 19:49.320
I'm going to propose
a hypothesis.

19:49.330 --> 19:52.580
Last night,
Raj accidentally made contact

19:52.580 --> 19:55.210
with an alien civilization

19:55.210 --> 19:57.380
and has been ordered
by the United States government

19:57.380 --> 19:59.420
to keep it a secret.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.390
Nothing happened.

20:01.390 --> 20:03.150
Can we please just
change the subject?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.690
That sounds rehearsed.

20:04.690 --> 20:06.320
We are not alone.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.160
Hey.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.490
Hey.
Hello.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.760
Hey.
Hey.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.500
You get to play with
Raj's big telescope last night?

20:18.040 --> 20:19.540
Whoa.

20:19.540 --> 20:21.360
Where did that come from?

20:21.360 --> 20:23.910
He never touched my telescope.

20:23.910 --> 20:25.480
Way to go shutting up.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.610
I did shut up. Now you shut up.

20:26.610 --> 20:27.980
Fine.
Thank you.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.720
I can't believe
you didn't call me this morning.
