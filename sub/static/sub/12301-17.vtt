WEBVTT

00:11.638 --> 00:14.818
We have several rental properties
available right now in Hialeah.

00:14.818 --> 00:17.227
I'd rather have them
closer to the city.

00:17.227 --> 00:18.991
Horatio...

00:19.141 --> 00:23.066
I told you, just because I slept with your
brother, does not make us your problem.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.465
No, but it makes you my family.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.274
Well, we have a two
bedroom available.

00:28.274 --> 00:31.291
Walking distance from
the Lowe art museum.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.011
The two bedroom is going to be fine.

00:33.011 --> 00:34.523
Okay, that's not
going to be a problem.

00:34.523 --> 00:38.176
Actually, the one bedroom
is more our price range.

00:40.572 --> 00:42.825
Dispatch knows
about this traffic, right?

00:42.825 --> 00:45.009
Yeah, yeah, I called it in.

00:45.009 --> 00:46.716
Look, don't worry about it, Paulie.

00:46.716 --> 00:50.227
When's the last time the federal reserve
was actually ready for our arrival?

01:01.473 --> 01:03.001
Watch out for this clown.

01:08.973 --> 01:10.187
Look out!

01:22.740 --> 01:24.147
Get down.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.504
Let's go! Let's go!

02:07.504 --> 02:09.210
Get out of the van!

02:12.374 --> 02:14.406
Hey, hey, what,
what are you doing?

02:14.406 --> 02:16.956
Don't do it! Don't do it!

02:21.288 --> 02:23.154
They never listen.

02:58.071 --> 03:00.785
MIAMI
2x17 Money for Nothing

03:11.231 --> 03:14.832
The armed robbers opened fire on the truck,
killing one guard and wounding another.

03:14.832 --> 03:17.777
Dade mutual officials are telling us
that an undisclosed amount of currency

03:17.777 --> 03:19.739
is reported missing at this time.

03:23.322 --> 03:25.128
You're supposed to be
getting here after we do.

03:25.128 --> 03:27.579
- What were you doing a block away?
- Had a personal matter in the area.

03:27.579 --> 03:30.260
I heard the shots, came over.
Are the FEDs here yet?

03:30.260 --> 03:31.802
They already handed it off to us.

03:31.802 --> 03:33.891
To them, it's an obstruction
of interstate commerce.

03:33.891 --> 03:36.816
Okay, well, our homicide trumps
their hobbs act violation.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.726
So, how much do they get away with?

03:38.726 --> 03:45.428
Two bags. $3.2 million from
dade mutual over on flagler.

03:50.881 --> 03:53.445
I want him prepped and ready
in the vip room when I get back.

03:53.445 --> 03:54.623
Yes, ma'am.

03:54.779 --> 03:57.266
Okay, Time for body number two.

03:58.584 --> 04:02.365
Armored truck's bullet proof,
but not for a.30 caliber.

04:05.188 --> 04:06.740
It's a shame, isn't it?

04:06.740 --> 04:09.619
What? / How we always
tend to the bad guy first.

04:09.619 --> 04:11.081
No choice, really,

04:11.081 --> 04:12.890
to crack the case.

04:12.890 --> 04:15.759
But a man with ten years service
at the armored car company

04:15.759 --> 04:18.629
does deserve better than
the man that killed him.

04:18.878 --> 04:21.415
I'll make sure of that, honey.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.274
Got a powder on his hands.

04:34.201 --> 04:36.942
Is it Wendell's powdered
doughnut bites?

04:38.609 --> 04:40.991
We always do the big deliveries,

04:42.254 --> 04:44.349
but I never seen anything like this.

04:44.349 --> 04:46.673
Was there a GPS unit
accompanying the money?

04:46.673 --> 04:48.119
That's what this is about,

04:48.119 --> 04:49.754
the $3.2 million?

04:49.754 --> 04:52.178
You already getting pressure
from the bank's insurance company?

04:52.178 --> 04:55.553
Mr. Donlan... / I just watched
my best friend die today.

04:55.553 --> 04:58.727
- I watched his head explode.
- Okay. Mr. Donlan,

04:58.727 --> 05:01.525
we're treating this as a homicide.
If there's a tracking device,

05:01.525 --> 05:04.166
we can follow your friend's killer.

05:06.805 --> 05:08.842
Banks, they, uh...

05:09.195 --> 05:12.668
they put a mini-locator
in each bag of money.

05:18.989 --> 05:20.878
Do you have the I.D. Numbers?

05:20.878 --> 05:22.327
Bank has them. / Okay.

05:22.327 --> 05:25.126
Let's talk to the bank and get
the I.D. Numbers on the money.

05:25.126 --> 05:26.667
Just got off the phone with them.

05:26.667 --> 05:30.314
Gave Speedle the numbers, thought
he could start a search from here.

05:30.314 --> 05:31.623
Oh, and, um...

05:33.747 --> 05:36.469
your personal matter showed up.

05:37.774 --> 05:41.756
She wants you to know that you
can apartment hunt another day.

05:41.756 --> 05:42.810
Okay.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.176
All right, thank you.
I'll speak to you later.

05:45.176 --> 05:46.681
Thank you.

05:47.077 --> 05:48.574
Ladies...

05:49.221 --> 05:50.268
Hi.

05:50.268 --> 05:54.367
So, I think that you should go ahead
and get the two bedroom, all right?

05:54.512 --> 05:56.093
Sounds great.

05:56.093 --> 05:57.643
Thanks.

05:58.355 --> 06:00.565
She is Ray's widow, isn't she?

06:00.656 --> 06:04.287
He told me she was colombian
and beautiful and a cop.

06:06.988 --> 06:12.482
Well... / Oh, don't worry, I'd never say
anything to her about me and Ray.

06:12.662 --> 06:15.086
Okay. Hey, Madison?

06:18.720 --> 06:21.452
So, I have to go back to work.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.291
Are you okay?

06:30.352 --> 06:32.304
Thank you.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.564
So I'll see you later?

06:36.932 --> 06:38.939
I'll see you ladies later.

06:38.939 --> 06:40.422
Bye. / Bye.

06:40.422 --> 06:42.271
Thanks.

06:44.645 --> 06:48.749
I got the GPS tracking signal
from those two money bags,

06:48.749 --> 06:50.884
but it's stationary.

06:50.884 --> 06:53.200
Now why would a guy who just
robbed an armored truck

06:53.200 --> 06:54.818
be parked like a sitting duck?

06:54.818 --> 06:58.059
It's possible because
I put two in his gas tank.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.679
You could've put two in him.

07:06.679 --> 07:08.203
Right, okay.

07:08.203 --> 07:11.850
These bags look like they're
still together. Go tight on that.

07:14.961 --> 07:17.058
Danforth drive.

07:17.058 --> 07:19.210
Let's go.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.802
Well, this is where
the signal stopped.

07:32.950 --> 07:33.916
Where's the van?

07:33.916 --> 07:35.534
That is a very good question.

07:38.633 --> 07:41.498
Okay, is that signal
in a fixed position?

07:42.586 --> 07:44.573
Yeah, right here.

07:44.573 --> 07:46.388
This is the spot.

07:46.603 --> 07:47.976
Okay, that means
it must be jammed.

07:47.976 --> 07:52.046
The navy has an anti-jamming testing site
about a mile down the road from here.

07:52.046 --> 07:53.513
Yeah, Sternwell laboratories.

07:53.513 --> 07:56.776
Tests the intentional
interference with the GPS.

08:03.775 --> 08:07.189
Covers about a two-mile radius.

08:07.886 --> 08:11.436
Well, this GPS signal froze when
he turned on to this road.

08:11.436 --> 08:14.327
Right. So unless the signal
appears elsewhere,

08:14.327 --> 08:17.118
he's right here in
this two-mile radius.

08:17.519 --> 08:20.664
Okay, so let's block
this off, east and west.

08:20.719 --> 08:22.333
Our guy is here.

08:41.361 --> 08:43.553
This vehicle sustained some damage.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.193
Ditched it off-road.

08:48.827 --> 08:50.062
Okay.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.052
This is all he left behind.

08:53.493 --> 08:56.924
Maybe it's because his hands
were full with the $3.2 million.

08:56.924 --> 09:01.264
We've a white male on foot heading
north toward cedar farm junction.

09:03.023 --> 09:04.693
Heading north.

09:05.566 --> 09:07.440
That's over this way, isn't it?

09:07.574 --> 09:09.042
Gentlemen, ready?

09:09.042 --> 09:10.351
Let's go.

09:29.204 --> 09:30.089
Hey!

09:30.826 --> 09:32.458
Get down on the ground.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.269
Right now.

09:42.044 --> 09:43.716
Face down! / Check him.

09:45.683 --> 09:47.295
We meet again.

09:47.352 --> 09:48.793
Gun!

09:49.549 --> 09:51.426
I got nothing to say to you.

09:51.426 --> 09:53.478
How about to the family
of the security you shot?

09:53.478 --> 09:55.785
How about them? Speed,

09:56.345 --> 09:57.915
what do we got?

10:00.105 --> 10:00.946
Take a good look at it.

10:00.946 --> 10:02.948
It's the last time you're
ever going to see it.

10:04.277 --> 10:05.963
Good job, fellas.

10:17.189 --> 10:20.329
So this is what $3.2 million looks like.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.431
Maybe, maybe not.

10:22.431 --> 10:24.760
Why, what's, uh, what's wrong?

10:25.435 --> 10:27.291
This $20 bill is my lunch money.

10:27.291 --> 10:28.882
Hold it up to the light.

10:29.339 --> 10:33.204
Look for a faint image of Andrew
jackson in the lower right corner.

10:33.204 --> 10:36.935
Yeah, the watermark, right? / Treasury
built it in to all U.S. paper currency.

10:36.935 --> 10:39.763
Like the colors that they added
last year, security feature?

10:39.763 --> 10:42.595
Now, have a look at this
$100 from the heist.

10:42.595 --> 10:44.853
Watermark should be Ben franklin.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.168
No. Ben's missing in action.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.930
But I do see a horse.

10:49.930 --> 10:52.046
Think lawrence of arabia.

10:52.046 --> 10:54.124
Well, near there.

10:54.237 --> 10:58.454
The Iraqi dinar? / Yeah. Ironically enough
their paper is the closest thing to ours.

10:58.454 --> 11:00.120
linen to cotton content.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.667
All of this money is counterfeit?

11:01.667 --> 11:03.887
Every random bill I've checked
so far has been a fake.

11:03.887 --> 11:07.623
So someone took iraqi dinars
and bleached them white.

11:07.623 --> 11:11.279
Let it dry, then printed the
american hundred right over it.

11:27.018 --> 11:28.765
But how did they get their
hands on so many dinars?

11:28.765 --> 11:30.740
I mean, that had to
cost a lot of money.

11:30.740 --> 11:31.868
War's made them dirt cheap.

11:31.868 --> 11:33.969
You can get them over
the internet for pennies.

11:33.969 --> 11:36.398
Apparently, somebody did in bulk.

11:39.281 --> 11:42.367
H? Yeah, you're not going
to believe this, but, uh,

11:42.367 --> 11:46.230
I've got some information on the
money stolen from the armored truck.

11:46.642 --> 11:48.189
Counterfeit?

11:48.189 --> 11:52.168
You ran off with $3.2 million dollars
in fake hundreds strapped to your back.

11:52.168 --> 11:54.586
Gonna make one hell of a story
for the cell block.

11:54.586 --> 11:57.406
Doesn't make sense.
We pulled it right out of that truck.

11:57.406 --> 11:59.184
Didn't even have time
to open the bags.

11:59.184 --> 12:01.152
So I guess somebody beat
you to it, didn't they?

12:01.152 --> 12:02.958
But the truck came
right from the bank.

12:02.958 --> 12:07.937
Yes, it did. Eric, go over dade mutual and
retrace the steps of the money, please.

12:09.514 --> 12:11.409
Hey, what happens to me?

12:11.409 --> 12:15.015
20 years to life. / Twenty years
for stealing counterfeit cash?

12:15.015 --> 12:16.563
The money isn't even real.

12:16.563 --> 12:18.202
Killing somebody was.

12:22.934 --> 12:27.423
The counterfeit money we retrieved from the
armored car robbery came from this branch.

12:27.423 --> 12:28.787
Your initials are on the tags.

12:28.787 --> 12:30.088
That was real currency.

12:30.088 --> 12:31.632
I initialed it yesterday afternoon.

12:31.632 --> 12:32.868
Who was with you?

12:32.868 --> 12:36.058
Two staff members.
They serve as witnesses.

12:40.589 --> 12:42.398
That's standard procedure.

12:42.398 --> 12:45.497
But we have reason to believe that
whoever planted the counterfeit money

12:45.497 --> 12:48.365
was familiar with standard
procedure at the federal reserve.

12:48.365 --> 12:50.482
Well, that would be
everyone at this bank.

12:50.482 --> 12:51.971
It's a job requirement.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.727
I'd like to see the vault.

12:59.045 --> 13:02.005
Every bill is determined fit
for circulation right here.

13:02.005 --> 13:06.741
Right now, we're running the weekly
cash deposits from lincoln road mall.

13:06.741 --> 13:11.232
The sensors inside pick up the
soil content, thickness, denomination.

13:11.232 --> 13:13.585
And then it spits out the rejects.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.667
And from here, I package it.

13:30.903 --> 13:34.302
Guards from Telfor armored arrived
when we opened this morning.

13:34.302 --> 13:36.084
No delays or anything?

13:36.084 --> 13:38.445
No. They signed for the pick-up,

13:38.445 --> 13:40.194
left right on time.

13:40.717 --> 13:42.428
Do you have a log?

13:48.917 --> 13:52.158
Signed for by Paul donlan, the driver.

13:52.731 --> 13:57.105
Dade mutual bundled
$3.2 million in real cash.

13:57.105 --> 14:01.493
We have a thief that was apprehended
with 3.2 in counterfeit bills.

14:01.493 --> 14:04.323
That leaves the man in the middle, you.

14:08.165 --> 14:10.319
So here's my question, Paul.

14:10.319 --> 14:14.707
Did you, somewhere along the route,
stop and swap the money out?

14:14.707 --> 14:18.125
John and I were driving the
shipment from point A to point B.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.783
Same as always. / So you notified
dispatch that you were 20 minutes late?

14:21.783 --> 14:24.336
There was construction
at the county auditorium.

14:24.336 --> 14:25.764
Check the log. / I did,

14:25.764 --> 14:29.963
and we are $3.2 million short.

14:29.963 --> 14:32.382
Then talk to the guy
that stole it, okay?

14:32.382 --> 14:33.961
You gonna believe him over me?

14:33.961 --> 14:36.069
Paul, in my business,

14:36.069 --> 14:39.226
I don't have that luxury
of believing anyone.

15:03.429 --> 15:04.763
Hey. / Hi.

15:05.355 --> 15:09.203
So, I drove the route
of the armored truck

15:09.203 --> 15:12.832
and it's four miles from the bank
to where they were ambushed.

15:12.832 --> 15:15.106
It matches Donlan's statement.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.653
This looks like the powdered
sugar we found in the cab.

15:22.566 --> 15:25.183
What does Telfor say?

15:25.673 --> 15:31.075
Telfor says that according to the
departure log, the odometer matches.

15:31.075 --> 15:32.968
Then it was traffic that made them late.

15:32.968 --> 15:34.519
See, but I think there was a detour.

15:34.519 --> 15:37.306
This odometer cable's
been tampered with.

15:58.562 --> 16:00.416
It's funny what people will do

16:00.416 --> 16:04.260
and think we'll never figure it out.

16:08.096 --> 16:10.985
I know who that girl is, Horatio.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.679
And her daughter.

16:12.679 --> 16:14.548
You mean Madison.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.683
That's a pretty name.

16:18.526 --> 16:21.316
Then did you think that I wouldn't
notice the resemblance?

16:21.316 --> 16:24.111
Yeah, well, I've been looking
for a way to tell you.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.586
You mean that you got involved
with an informant?

16:26.586 --> 16:27.878
Hey, these things happen.

16:27.878 --> 16:30.606
Well, Yelina, that's...

16:30.847 --> 16:32.488
That's not exactly what happened.

16:32.488 --> 16:36.400
Okay, I know, she started as a parolee.
You offered help and she took it.

16:37.992 --> 16:40.299
It's a little more complicated than that.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.047
I guess.

16:43.660 --> 16:48.209
So... let me make this
simple, yeah?

16:48.356 --> 16:49.981
It's okay.

16:49.981 --> 16:51.572
You can bring them around.

16:59.546 --> 17:00.693
Calleigh duquesne.

17:00.693 --> 17:02.105
Peter elliott, secret service.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.009
Oh, nice to meet you.

17:03.009 --> 17:08.396
This is a written request to take the counterfeit
notes back to our miami field office for analysis.

17:08.547 --> 17:09.618
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:09.618 --> 17:11.517
These bills are part of an
ongoing murder investigation.

17:11.517 --> 17:14.301
We've got a counterfeit ring in Bogota
responsible for several dead bodies.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.598
If it's related, every minute counts.

17:15.598 --> 17:18.281
Well, I understand, but another set
of hands might contaminate the evidence

17:18.281 --> 17:19.983
and I just can't allow that to happen.

17:19.983 --> 17:21.311
But I'll make sure you get serial numbers.

17:21.311 --> 17:23.269
No, my task force needs to know
how the bills are made,

17:23.269 --> 17:24.962
not which bills are in play.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.932
Okay, when we get close to toolmarks
and ink processing, I'll call you.

17:27.932 --> 17:30.942
You don't, and you'll be hearing from my boss
down at the homeland security office.

17:30.942 --> 17:32.859
Well, I've got goosebumps.

17:33.301 --> 17:35.096
Looking forward to working with you.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.055
Hey.

17:42.874 --> 17:44.466
I thought Cynthia was on this.

17:44.466 --> 17:47.480
Nope, she's in court.
It looks like it's just you and me.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.335
Okay. Well, uh, you find anything?

17:49.335 --> 17:52.887
No. I've been going through these
paper straps looking for fingerprints,

17:52.887 --> 17:54.917
but so far all I've got are smudges.

17:54.917 --> 17:58.487
Okay. Wow. These bills
are going to be worse.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.748
I guess I'll get started
on the bank tags.

18:02.918 --> 18:04.441
Hey.

18:04.441 --> 18:06.140
Check this out.

18:07.332 --> 18:09.885
Oh! GPS tracking device.

18:09.885 --> 18:12.045
This is great. I was wondering
when this would turn up.

18:12.045 --> 18:14.544
Plastic holds prints better than paper.

18:14.652 --> 18:16.462
All right, I'll take a look.

19:03.077 --> 19:04.529
Hey.

19:04.821 --> 19:05.899
Hey.

19:06.068 --> 19:10.185
Look, the partial I found
on the GPS card has a tented arch.

19:10.185 --> 19:13.242
Well, that makes it unusual enough
for process of elimination.

19:13.242 --> 19:17.212
Yeah, I'm cross-checking it with
Telfor armored transportation.

19:17.212 --> 19:20.489
All of their employees are
required to get printed, so...

19:21.539 --> 19:25.320
Okay, so two employees at Telfor
who have a tented arch.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.537
One's a receptionist.

19:28.222 --> 19:30.418
And the other is Paul donlan.

19:31.291 --> 19:32.668
What are you saying?

19:34.669 --> 19:38.732
What I'm saying is that between
the time you picked up the money

19:38.732 --> 19:40.392
and got robbed,

19:40.392 --> 19:42.807
you swapped it out somewhere.
That's what I'm saying.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.678
- You can't prove that.
- Actually, I can.

19:44.678 --> 19:48.969
Your fingerprint was recovered
from the GPS unit

19:48.969 --> 19:51.955
that we found with the
counterfeit money, Paul.

19:59.811 --> 20:01.494
What kind of idiot would do that?

20:01.494 --> 20:02.964
A clever idiot.

20:02.964 --> 20:06.086
You switch the GPS tracker
to the counterfeit money,

20:06.086 --> 20:07.995
the authorities think
everything's normal.

20:07.995 --> 20:11.078
- Everything was normal.
- No, it wasn't, Paul.

20:11.078 --> 20:13.092
I took a look at your odometer

20:13.092 --> 20:17.151
and you and John departed
from your normal course...

20:20.215 --> 20:23.400
at which time, you
swapped out the money

20:23.617 --> 20:26.200
and he dialed back the
odometer, didn't he?

20:26.200 --> 20:30.255
We found powdered sugar
on the odometer cable.

20:30.255 --> 20:35.462
Paul, how long do you think it
would take us to figure this out?

20:37.056 --> 20:39.003
What's the matter, Paul?

20:39.657 --> 20:41.817
Going to lawyer up on us?

20:46.090 --> 20:47.848
Eric.

20:48.718 --> 20:50.728
Hang on a second.

20:52.910 --> 20:54.891
Paul,

20:54.891 --> 20:56.921
are you covering for someone?

20:56.921 --> 21:00.016
Does somebody have you
in a corner? Who is it?

21:00.016 --> 21:01.765
- She'll die.
- Who's going to die?

21:01.765 --> 21:05.139
- I probably already screwed it up.
- Who's going to die, Paul?

21:05.139 --> 21:07.426
My little sister.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.452
I got a call last night.

21:10.452 --> 21:13.167
It was a voice, an accent.

21:13.275 --> 21:14.519
They knew.

21:14.519 --> 21:17.668
They knew I was assigned to
the big federal reserve payload.

21:18.396 --> 21:19.282
Hello?

21:19.282 --> 21:21.036
What's your cargo tomorrow, Paul?

21:21.036 --> 21:22.120
Excuse me?

21:22.120 --> 21:23.519
We're gonna make a deal.

21:23.519 --> 21:25.359
My money for yours.

21:25.359 --> 21:26.927
Who the hell is this?

21:27.097 --> 21:28.296
Paul...

21:28.296 --> 21:30.580
do what they say, please.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.831
Mary? what's going on?
Where are you?

21:32.831 --> 21:35.990
They're going to kill me, Paul, please.

21:36.974 --> 21:39.003
They said,

21:39.003 --> 21:40.910
make the exchange

21:40.910 --> 21:42.634
and she won't get killed.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.667
You dropped off the money.

21:45.725 --> 21:47.829
At the coffee factory, yeah.

21:47.829 --> 21:50.317
- Did they release her?
- I don't know.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.697
I've been here.

21:52.697 --> 21:55.964
Last time I saw the real money
was at the coffee factory.

21:56.324 --> 21:57.655
Come on, John.

21:57.785 --> 22:00.818
The fake bills were in boxes under a tarp.

22:03.306 --> 22:05.149
Johnny and I pulled out the real money,

22:05.149 --> 22:08.463
and swapped it as fast
as we could in the truck.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.982
We left the real money under the tarp.

22:37.070 --> 22:39.565
Somebody has left something on this.

22:40.044 --> 22:42.230
I think it's got to come with us.

22:56.768 --> 22:57.726
What have you got?

22:57.726 --> 23:00.834
I found these on a case in
silver bluff a couple years ago.

23:00.834 --> 23:02.278
What is it?

23:03.556 --> 23:07.894
Ooids. Marine organisms,
they turn into limestone.

23:07.894 --> 23:10.481
Falling sea levels, uh, expose them.

23:10.481 --> 23:13.564
At an abandoned coffee warehouse?
That's strange, don't you think?

23:13.564 --> 23:16.106
I mean, compressed limestone
is only up on the coastal ridge.

23:16.106 --> 23:18.041
And even then, you have to dig for it.

23:18.041 --> 23:19.699
Unless you have a basement.

23:27.379 --> 23:31.150
This is the city buildings
association database.

23:32.216 --> 23:35.473
There are six remaining
basements in the area.

23:35.473 --> 23:39.051
Yeah, that's 'cause most of them would
have flooded 'cause miami's at sea level.

23:39.051 --> 23:43.681
These properties on coconut grove,
they're, uh, on the atlantic coastal ridge,

23:43.681 --> 23:45.177
so they're 20~24 feet above.

23:45.177 --> 23:50.731
So we've got two retirement homes
and four private dwellings.

23:51.694 --> 23:54.473
Didn't you used to date a girl
at the department of water and power?

23:54.473 --> 23:57.373
Yes, I did, a long time ago.
And she hates me.

23:57.373 --> 23:58.544
Why?

23:58.544 --> 24:01.560
Well, it's just, it takes a lot
of juice to run an offset printer

24:01.560 --> 24:05.978
and the electrical bill of our
counterfeit house would be spiking.

24:06.168 --> 24:07.711
It's not that tough an ask,

24:07.711 --> 24:09.465
even if she hates you.

24:24.942 --> 24:27.030
So the power company
said that the kilowatts

24:27.030 --> 24:28.740
tripled in the last two months.

24:28.740 --> 24:30.958
I don't know how you're
going to miss that.

24:31.152 --> 24:32.385
It's a rental.

24:32.385 --> 24:35.862
I guess this snowbird has their
accountant pay the bills.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.328
Somebody certainly made
themselves at home here.

24:46.092 --> 24:49.212
Well, this is definitely
where they made their millions.

24:49.401 --> 24:50.925
Literally.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.974
Looks like the equipment's
been refurbished.

25:09.974 --> 25:12.017
Yeah.

25:12.017 --> 25:14.928
Some GSA disposal sale.

25:14.928 --> 25:17.120
Hey, you might want
to take a look at this.

25:18.174 --> 25:19.720
What do you got?

25:26.625 --> 25:29.359
You think Mary donlan was
being held down here?

25:29.359 --> 25:32.374
Increasingly looking
that way, isn't it?

25:32.546 --> 25:34.688
This is interesting.

25:34.688 --> 25:37.422
There's less than
a pint of blood here.

25:38.780 --> 25:40.258
Yeah, so?

25:40.258 --> 25:41.954
So...

25:41.954 --> 25:43.978
she could still be alive.

26:17.580 --> 26:18.893
This material's, uh,

26:18.893 --> 26:22.641
rolled and tied at both ends.
The victim was gagged.

26:28.456 --> 26:31.656
You know, I don't see any serum
around this blood pool.

26:33.082 --> 26:35.543
It's weird, you'd think
it would have separated by now.

26:35.543 --> 26:36.831
It's the basement.

26:36.831 --> 26:38.865
Maybe it's the cooler temperature.

26:44.548 --> 26:46.931
You know, I think these guys were
counterfeiting more than money.

26:46.931 --> 26:49.144
I've got some clear laminate here.

26:49.144 --> 26:50.887
Fake IDs.

26:51.125 --> 26:53.344
Somebody's going somewhere.

26:56.584 --> 26:58.575
Thanks for the heads-up, Duquesne.

26:59.170 --> 27:03.281
Ah. Tim speedle,
Peter elliott, secret service.

27:03.281 --> 27:05.167
The rules say I have to call you.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.052
They just don't say when.

27:09.057 --> 27:12.118
It's a hot crime scene. / We'll try
to track these machines to their seller.

27:12.118 --> 27:14.375
Run any ink we find through our library.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.315
May I make a suggestion, agent Elliott?

27:17.315 --> 27:19.038
Something tells me
I don't have a choice.

27:19.038 --> 27:22.386
Well, perhaps the government's
practice of seizing equipment at raids

27:22.386 --> 27:25.215
and then reselling it at public
auction isn't the best idea.

27:25.215 --> 27:29.237
I mean, wouldn't it be easier just to quit
selling offset printers to the bad guys,

27:29.237 --> 27:32.154
instead of tracking them
down after the fact? I mean...

27:32.154 --> 27:34.492
- wouldn't it?
- GSA does that, not us.

27:34.492 --> 27:37.498
But I'll be sure to pass it on
during my next visit to DC.

27:54.018 --> 27:55.097
Hey, Cyn.

27:55.097 --> 27:58.709
These laminate slivers
are decimating my 20/20s.

27:58.709 --> 28:01.203
I'm taking donations
for seeing-eye dogs.

28:01.203 --> 28:03.523
Oh. I'll send you a check.

28:03.523 --> 28:07.455
- Are these from the counterfeit labs?
- Something on this one. Take a look.

28:10.112 --> 28:11.688
Part of a...

28:11.688 --> 28:13.047
circle.

28:13.047 --> 28:17.452
From a seal, maybe. / Could be.
Ultraviolet ink imprinted on laminate.

28:17.452 --> 28:18.821
It's probably from a passport.

28:18.821 --> 28:21.770
They would have cut away the laminate
coating to insert a new photograph.

28:21.770 --> 28:23.968
It could've pulled some of the seal with it.

28:27.357 --> 28:32.051
Okay. So someone's created a fake passport to
get out of the country with their unearned millions.

28:32.051 --> 28:34.372
The question is... where to?

28:34.372 --> 28:37.362
It looks like there are some
pieces of letters here.

28:39.156 --> 28:40.782
We need to find out
what those words are.

28:40.782 --> 28:44.133
I'll try to expand the impression,
compare it to other seals.

28:44.133 --> 28:46.063
I know. / Quickly.

28:46.545 --> 28:47.769
Thank you.

28:49.023 --> 28:50.319
Is that blood from the basement?

28:50.319 --> 28:54.081
Yeah. Genetic markers
indicate a female sibling.

28:54.081 --> 28:56.045
Donlan's sister.

28:56.556 --> 28:58.434
I guess he was telling the truth.

28:58.434 --> 29:01.343
Okay, score one for him.

29:03.112 --> 29:06.432
Speed, why is this blood pool still wet?

29:06.432 --> 29:08.347
I don't know. It's weird. It's, uh,

29:08.583 --> 29:11.707
it's not clotting, so I'm
running a test on it right now.

29:15.204 --> 29:16.166
Well, here's why.

29:16.166 --> 29:18.244
It's got an anticoagulant in it.

29:18.244 --> 29:22.877
- Acid citrate dextrose.
- ACD, that's a preservative.

29:23.449 --> 29:26.870
Let me ask you another question.
Did she plant this blood?

29:39.407 --> 29:42.196
Why not? Everything else is fake.
The kidnapping, the money.

29:42.196 --> 29:43.992
Right. But her money is real.

29:43.992 --> 29:48.931
So we send Yelina over to Paul donlan's
house and see if sis cut him in.

29:49.818 --> 29:52.530
I'm telling you, I know my sister.

29:52.715 --> 29:54.850
I could hear it in her voice.

29:55.091 --> 29:57.058
She was in trouble.

29:57.058 --> 30:00.336
Look, we know that
Mary's blood was planted.

30:00.336 --> 30:02.279
The crime scene was staged. So,

30:02.279 --> 30:04.614
either she's trying to sell
you some kind of bogus story,

30:04.614 --> 30:07.392
or you're trying to sell us
one now. Which is it?

30:07.515 --> 30:09.438
I'm innocent.

30:09.648 --> 30:11.490
Mr. Donlan...

30:12.727 --> 30:14.559
we went to your home.

30:14.811 --> 30:17.048
E-mail correspondence from your hard drive.

30:18.504 --> 30:19.875
Courtesy of a search warrant.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.918
I haven't been on my
computer in three days.

30:22.052 --> 30:25.877
But four days ago, you bought
a ticket from miami to Argentina.

30:25.877 --> 30:27.883
And it leaves tomorrow.

30:28.596 --> 30:29.494
I didn't buy that.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.317
Your credit card says you did.

30:31.844 --> 30:32.953
Maybe,

30:32.953 --> 30:36.141
maybe she set me up,
I don't know.

30:36.472 --> 30:38.898
But I thought she was
in serious trouble.

30:39.107 --> 30:41.200
That's why I took the risk.

30:43.244 --> 30:44.691
That's why John did.

30:55.057 --> 30:56.234
Did we trace his cell phone?

30:56.234 --> 30:58.403
Couldn't lock down any location
from those incoming calls.

30:58.403 --> 31:02.582
For all we know, calls came from him,
from another cell phone in his house.

31:02.582 --> 31:05.645
Why don't we take a look at
that tarp from the coffee factory?

31:05.645 --> 31:08.861
Maybe it'll tell us if there's
another party involved.

31:34.955 --> 31:36.648
It's from the coffee factory?

31:36.906 --> 31:38.206
Yeah.

31:38.340 --> 31:39.924
There's some trace on it.

31:39.924 --> 31:41.568
Dimethicone, hmm?

31:41.768 --> 31:46.506
Cocamide, water, selenium sulfide.
That's the treatment for pityriasis simplex.

31:46.506 --> 31:48.923
I know, it's great, we're looking
for somebody with dandruff.

31:48.923 --> 31:52.381
Who also left the counterfeit bills
under this tarp for pick-up.

31:58.603 --> 32:01.779
Dry scalp doesn't
exactly narrow the field.

32:06.747 --> 32:08.653
I think we may have
already found him.

32:08.778 --> 32:09.976
Just didn't know it.

32:14.481 --> 32:16.387
I use dandruff shampoo.

32:16.628 --> 32:18.996
What, am I like the only guy
with a few flakes in miami?

32:18.996 --> 32:20.316
Big deal.

32:21.202 --> 32:22.796
Robert,

32:22.796 --> 32:26.522
this is a very big deal.

32:27.587 --> 32:28.734
Who's she?

32:28.734 --> 32:30.541
Her name's Mary donlan.

32:30.684 --> 32:35.813
Your coworkers say you took her to a community
investment luncheon three weeks ago.

32:35.813 --> 32:37.511
I didn't bring her.

32:37.810 --> 32:39.235
Okay.

32:41.090 --> 32:46.504
An employee was kind enough to offer
this personal photo from their cubicle.

32:50.406 --> 32:52.058
There you have it.

32:52.544 --> 32:55.822
That is you and Mary.

32:56.337 --> 33:03.245
Robert, $3.2 million from the bank that
you manage was paid to free Mary donlan.

33:03.404 --> 33:05.597
But that,

33:05.597 --> 33:09.348
as we know, is not
the entire story, is it?

33:09.348 --> 33:10.225
What?

33:10.225 --> 33:12.869
Mary has a brother named Paul.

33:12.869 --> 33:14.823
He's your cash courier.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.462
Hello.

33:17.462 --> 33:20.090
We're going to make a deal,
my money for yours.

33:20.090 --> 33:21.921
Who the hell is this?

33:23.342 --> 33:27.036
Paul, do what they say, please.

33:27.036 --> 33:29.104
Mary? Mary, what's going on?
Where are you?

33:29.104 --> 33:30.875
They're going to kill me, Paul,

33:30.900 --> 33:32.402
please.

33:37.455 --> 33:41.406
You and Mary made up the fake cash,
dropped it off at the factory,

33:41.406 --> 33:47.421
then instructed poor old Paul to swap
it out on his way to the federal reserve.

33:53.146 --> 33:57.766
Fake bills would sit in the fed vault for up
to five days before they get processed.

33:57.766 --> 34:02.489
You and Mary would be long gone with
the real money before anyone would even notice.

34:02.489 --> 34:06.019
What you didn't count on was
the heist and the two dead bodies.

34:06.019 --> 34:09.855
But what I am really
curious about, Robert,

34:09.855 --> 34:14.273
is where were you and Mary
going to spend that money?

34:15.944 --> 34:19.034
She was going to tell me
when she got there.

34:20.121 --> 34:22.261
And you believed it?

34:25.543 --> 34:27.922
I think Mary's going
to make a run for it.

34:27.922 --> 34:32.820
I agree. So let's catch her before
she's spent all of Robert's money.

34:39.899 --> 34:42.145
You little monkey!

34:42.302 --> 34:43.455
Hi.

34:44.021 --> 34:47.235
Hi. Oh, sorry to just drop by like this.

34:47.235 --> 34:50.471
Um, Madison was
insisting to see you. She's

34:50.471 --> 34:52.672
very, very worried about you.

34:52.672 --> 34:55.004
You're worried about me? Why?

34:55.004 --> 34:57.431
She saw the blood on your
shirt at the wreck.

34:57.431 --> 34:59.830
Does it hurt, Horatio? / Nah.

34:59.830 --> 35:04.541
You know what? I was helping
somebody at the time, but I'm fine now,

35:04.541 --> 35:05.904
so I'm okay.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.775
Will you come see
our new apartment?

35:07.775 --> 35:11.247
Sure. / Yeah, no doorman,
but good lighting.

35:11.247 --> 35:13.354
Great school system for her.

35:13.354 --> 35:17.769
Okay. / The landlord is using that check
you gave him against the first year's rent,

35:17.769 --> 35:22.514
- So thank you very, very much.
- Not a problem.

35:25.642 --> 35:27.257
Hi.

35:27.332 --> 35:28.598
Hey.

35:28.598 --> 35:30.162
Yelina, this is Suzie.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.048
Hi / Hi, Suzie.

35:31.048 --> 35:32.636
Nice to meet you. / Hello.

35:32.636 --> 35:35.690
And I want you to meet Madison.

35:35.747 --> 35:37.302
Hey, Madison.

35:38.239 --> 35:40.297
Aren't you a pretty girl.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.348
Thank you.

35:44.795 --> 35:48.418
I have to go, guys, but I will come
by and see the apartment later,

35:48.418 --> 35:49.600
How about that,

35:49.600 --> 35:51.203
okay? / Okay.

35:51.203 --> 35:53.602
Okay, ladies. / Thanks.
We'll talk later.

36:06.561 --> 36:08.118
Did we get anything on the laminate?

36:08.118 --> 36:12.047
I expanded the impression that I found on it
and then I enlarged the partial lettering.

36:12.047 --> 36:15.178
I could only get us a few of the letters,
but based on spacing and font,

36:15.178 --> 36:16.970
I ran a comparison.

36:24.278 --> 36:27.854
Somebody's going to Switzerland,
the money capital of the world.

36:27.854 --> 36:31.329
Smart place to take all that cash.
There's a bank on every block.

36:31.329 --> 36:32.909
Yes. / No questions asked.

36:32.909 --> 36:36.624
Okay, we need to find Mary donlan's
assumed name right now.

36:36.624 --> 36:38.761
Well, the passport's stolen,
so it might have been reported.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.335
Let's check the consulate.

36:44.355 --> 36:46.675
The swiss consulate has
extended full cooperation.

36:46.675 --> 36:49.212
They just sent over their
registration services file.

36:49.212 --> 36:50.625
Okay, what about the airport?

36:50.625 --> 36:52.610
Tim's on the phone with their
security division right now.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.874
He's going to cross-check all
outgoing flight manifests.

36:55.874 --> 36:58.705
Okay, here it is. Passports lost
or stolen in the last seven days.

36:58.705 --> 37:01.200
Yeah, hang on a second. I'm just
going to run you off some names.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.744
Susana bauman.

37:03.744 --> 37:06.173
Nils overdahl.

37:06.173 --> 37:08.231
Ralph elminger.

37:08.231 --> 37:10.516
Christina hartung.

37:10.516 --> 37:12.781
And Kelley brennwald.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.344
Anything? / Nothing.

37:16.344 --> 37:17.557
So here's what we do.

37:17.557 --> 37:21.372
We try charter flights. It is easier to pass
the currency through bag inspection.

37:21.372 --> 37:25.197
How about charter flights? You got
anything touching down in Switzerland?

37:25.863 --> 37:28.435
We got one. Harrigan charters.

37:28.435 --> 37:29.920
It's bound for Geneva.

37:29.920 --> 37:34.162
And the reservation's under
Nils overdahl, Kelley brennwald.

37:34.162 --> 37:35.625
There you go.

37:35.736 --> 37:37.413
They're both on the list.

37:37.832 --> 37:39.243
They're booked to fly out tonight.

37:39.243 --> 37:40.482
Not anymore.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.012
Any problems?

37:55.139 --> 37:57.733
Of course not. / Oh, good.

38:00.896 --> 38:02.560
So...

38:03.237 --> 38:05.087
you going to miss any of this?

38:05.087 --> 38:06.510
I could learn not to.

38:11.172 --> 38:12.773
Let's go.

38:19.494 --> 38:21.424
What's, what's going on?

38:21.554 --> 38:24.636
You set up your brother,
that's what's going on.

38:32.824 --> 38:35.112
Admitting to nothing,
my brother's an easy mark.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.810
How heart-warming.

38:37.206 --> 38:40.195
Hey, if he let me do that to him,
then part of him wanted it done.

38:40.195 --> 38:41.936
And if you got away?

38:42.034 --> 38:44.496
I know him. He'd pay for it.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.743
Or clean it all up and make it right.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.292
Speaking of which...

38:48.292 --> 38:50.292
you are under arrest.

38:50.292 --> 38:51.996
Ma'am. / your hands, sir.

38:53.618 --> 38:55.261
Call my brother,
he'll take care of it.

38:55.261 --> 38:57.608
I think you're going to
have to ask him yourself.

38:57.608 --> 39:00.979
- I get one phone call.
- I hope you're not expecting bail.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.507
Why, am I a flight risk?

39:03.507 --> 39:05.090
Not anymore.

39:14.249 --> 39:15.298
Thanks for the call.

39:15.298 --> 39:18.427
Ah, Mr. Elliot. I was just
boxing the evidence for you.

39:18.427 --> 39:20.776
Our case against the sister's made.

39:20.860 --> 39:23.488
- What about her boy toy?
- Well, technically we can't hold him.

39:23.488 --> 39:26.451
He says that he knows nothing,
He was just going on vacation.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.404
Secret service can detain him on
counterfeiting charges.

39:28.404 --> 39:31.514
His name came up in connection
with a distributor down in argentina.

39:31.514 --> 39:33.375
Well, your charge would stick.

39:34.047 --> 39:35.818
That's why you called.

39:35.913 --> 39:37.176
You need me now.

39:37.176 --> 39:39.338
I do. We do.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.585
I'll walk him down to federal holding.

39:43.585 --> 39:45.055
Thank you.

39:45.055 --> 39:46.782
I'd appreciate that.

40:40.544 --> 40:42.878
You okay? / Yeah...

40:45.587 --> 40:47.468
When I heard...

40:48.137 --> 40:49.767
she was...

40:49.767 --> 40:53.716
in trouble I didn't hesitate

40:54.323 --> 40:56.726
because she's my little sister.

40:57.566 --> 40:59.635
I've always kept an eye on her.

41:00.221 --> 41:02.891
That's exactly what you did, Paul.

41:03.368 --> 41:05.163
Did I?

41:05.664 --> 41:07.764
That woman,

41:07.764 --> 41:10.466
I don't know who she is.

41:10.466 --> 41:12.948
She became somebody else
when I wasn't looking.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.410
Paul...

41:14.707 --> 41:19.048
you can watch over people but
you can't make choices for them.

41:21.254 --> 41:24.475
I don't think I'm going
to make it on the inside.

41:25.115 --> 41:27.094
You're going to be fine.

41:28.752 --> 41:30.698
Yeah. / Okay.

41:39.855 --> 41:41.805
There's the true victim.

41:41.805 --> 41:44.103
Just lost his best friend,

41:44.205 --> 41:46.256
threw away his life,
and for whom?

41:46.256 --> 41:47.819
For his family.

41:52.716 --> 41:54.780
Your friend find an apartment?

41:54.780 --> 41:56.850
Yeah, they found a place and it's,

41:56.850 --> 41:58.975
it's in a safe area, too.

42:00.302 --> 42:02.685
Yeah. Good.

42:02.685 --> 42:05.077
Um, can I walk you out?

42:07.662 --> 42:09.651
I don't think so.

42:11.414 --> 42:13.712
I think, um,

42:13.712 --> 42:15.447
I'm okay.
