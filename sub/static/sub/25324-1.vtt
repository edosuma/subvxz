12:21.907 --> 12:24.040
- [Dani] 11:00.
- [Grace] I'll be there.

12:24.042 --> 12:26.508
- [Dani] Oh good.
- [Valerie] Oh, I get off at 10:00 so I can come too.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.277
Oh, sweet.

12:28.279 --> 12:30.249
I can't wait until
we don't have to serve anymore.

12:32.417 --> 12:34.818
Please you've been doing this what?
Like, a year?

12:34.820 --> 12:36.386
Yeah, like 10 months.

12:36.388 --> 12:37.252
Five years.

12:37.254 --> 12:38.921
Six for me.

12:38.923 --> 12:40.455
And before that,
I worked as an escort.

12:40.457 --> 12:41.925
What?

12:41.927 --> 12:44.960
Didn't I tell you?
It was horrible.

12:44.962 --> 12:48.864
I escorted nursing home patients
from their room to the dining hall.

12:48.866 --> 12:50.032
Oh my God, Grace,
this is not...

12:50.034 --> 12:52.036
Gross. That's even worse.

12:53.337 --> 12:56.375
[grunting]

13:01.580 --> 13:03.579
- Yo.
- Yeah.

13:03.581 --> 13:05.214
What are you doing
tomorrow morning?

13:05.216 --> 13:07.249
Cottage weekend, bro, no plans.

13:07.251 --> 13:08.184
Sweet. I'm gonna make
breakfast for everybody.

13:08.186 --> 13:09.886
- Sick.
- Yeah.

13:09.888 --> 13:11.253
Yo, you should have
brought Michelle up with you.

13:11.255 --> 13:14.456
Yeah, we broke up.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.959
Man, you're with a new lady
like every week.

13:16.961 --> 13:18.530
- I know right? Pretty much.
- [chuckles]

13:20.498 --> 13:22.598
Ah!

13:22.600 --> 13:24.035
[laughing]

13:27.239 --> 13:30.940
Ew. Allison Hanbell
is getting married.

13:30.942 --> 13:33.309
- [Dani] Shut up, to who?
- Some guy in a wheelchair.

13:33.311 --> 13:34.509
I'm so mad
I have to like that

13:34.511 --> 13:36.512
and pretend to be happy
for her.

13:36.514 --> 13:37.817
Let me see.

13:39.183 --> 13:40.382
He's cute for a "parlegic."

13:40.384 --> 13:43.051
- It's paraplegic.
- Oh.

13:43.053 --> 13:46.355
Does your penis still work
if you're in a wheelchair?

13:46.357 --> 13:48.458
- I don't think so.
- No, I think it does.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.026
I think if you're paralyzed from
the waist down, that it works.

13:50.028 --> 13:52.161
But if you're like, neck down,

13:52.163 --> 13:54.664
Christopher Reeve style paralyzed,
then your dick doesn't work.

13:54.666 --> 13:57.300
That's it, I'm Googling it.
I need to know.

13:57.302 --> 13:59.435
I see Allison at, like,
every audition I go to.

13:59.437 --> 14:02.604
She always pretends to forget my name.
It drives me crazy.

14:02.606 --> 14:04.373
She calls me Darlene.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.209
Darlene is the name
of a fat teenager

14:06.211 --> 14:08.111
with three kids
and grandchildren.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.113
I went to high school
with a girl named Darlene.

14:10.115 --> 14:13.181
She is now a heroin addict
with no teeth,

14:13.183 --> 14:15.350
but she's so skinny
it pisses me off.

14:15.352 --> 14:18.121
[scoffs] Jealous.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.622
"In an interview
with Larry King,

14:19.624 --> 14:22.358
"Christopher said
he can't have sex with his wife

14:22.360 --> 14:25.295
in an ordinary way,
but there's creativity."

14:25.297 --> 14:26.963
What the hell does that mean?

14:26.965 --> 14:29.531
I don't know.
I'm thinking, in the butt.

14:29.533 --> 14:32.602
So what I was saying,
I want two more right here.

14:32.604 --> 14:34.603
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I do
these lower ab leg lifts.

14:34.605 --> 14:36.138
They are fucking amazing.

14:36.140 --> 14:38.041
Word, that's amazing.
I need those.

14:38.043 --> 14:41.076
I need eight 'cause I feel like
six isn't enough anymore.

14:41.078 --> 14:43.278
No, yeah, that's why I'm working on
these last two. Gotta get that eight.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.379
Eight's the new six, bro.

14:44.381 --> 14:45.480
- I get that.
- Right?

14:45.482 --> 14:47.550
Okay, pull me up.

14:47.552 --> 14:49.017
Tighter.

14:49.019 --> 14:50.420
And then I'm going up, and...

14:50.422 --> 14:52.457
[grunting]

14:54.960 --> 14:56.559
Yes.

14:56.561 --> 14:59.429
- Bro, chicks love these lines.
- Oh, yeah.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.530
Chicks.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.035
[grunting]

15:07.172 --> 15:09.272
The rebels are
moving in quickly.

15:09.274 --> 15:10.706
[line reader] "There are too many of them.
We won't make it."

15:10.708 --> 15:12.407
I have an idea,
but you aren't gonna like it.

15:12.409 --> 15:14.109
[line reader] "You can't,
it's suicide."

15:14.111 --> 15:15.744
[scoffs]
There's no other choice.

15:15.746 --> 15:17.313
[line reader]
"No you could do nothing.

15:17.315 --> 15:18.613
"We could just turn
around now and leave."

15:18.615 --> 15:20.583
And let Spring be destroyed?

15:20.585 --> 15:23.319
[line reader] "I just
can't live without you."

15:23.321 --> 15:25.423
I promise
we'll be together again.

15:27.258 --> 15:29.358
[casting director] Okay, okay.

15:29.360 --> 15:34.363
Um, I'd like you to try
that again, but I would...

15:34.365 --> 15:37.699
I'd like you to be
a little more masculine.

15:37.701 --> 15:38.700
Masculine?

15:38.702 --> 15:40.236
[casting director] Mm-hmm, yes.

15:40.238 --> 15:44.109
[pop music playing]

15:46.110 --> 15:48.276
I started taking
harmonica lessons.

15:48.278 --> 15:50.613
Guys, it's so hard.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.614
Like, remembering
when to blow out,

15:52.616 --> 15:54.449
when to blow in,
it's too much.

15:54.451 --> 15:56.386
Why are you taking
harmonica lessons?

15:56.388 --> 15:58.787
My agent says I need to up my
special skills on my resume.

15:58.789 --> 16:01.757
She says 34C breasts
isn't a special skill.

16:01.759 --> 16:04.292
You're a 34C?

16:04.294 --> 16:06.094
You must be pretty close.

16:06.096 --> 16:10.065
Uh, yeah. 32C actually, so,
I guess I have smaller ribs

16:10.067 --> 16:12.667
and bigger boobs than you.

16:12.669 --> 16:13.705
Oh.

16:15.673 --> 16:17.140
What else is on your
special skills list?

16:17.142 --> 16:20.045
Basic whistling
and nostril flares.

16:22.179 --> 16:23.813
My special skills
section is amazing.

16:23.815 --> 16:27.282
Piano, saxophone,
learner's permit,

16:27.284 --> 16:30.752
skating, snowboarding,
basic aerobics,

16:30.754 --> 16:33.823
expert bongo playing,
surfing, glass blowing,

16:33.825 --> 16:37.560
medical terminology,
teleprompter, collage artist,

16:37.562 --> 16:40.729
hula hoop, competitive
swimming, knitting,

16:40.731 --> 16:42.598
and great with kids.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.498
You're a competitive swimmer?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.133
It was in high school.

16:45.135 --> 16:48.537
Oh man, yeah, I can
barely even doggy paddle.

16:48.539 --> 16:51.339
- I just never really learned.
- Seriously?

16:51.341 --> 16:52.510
Swimming is like
a basic life skill.

16:55.513 --> 16:57.081
[men grunting]

17:02.419 --> 17:04.853
You look so sexy
all wet like that.

17:04.855 --> 17:07.824
- Hey, thank you. That's enough.
- [grunting]

17:07.826 --> 17:09.224
[tense music]

17:09.227 --> 17:12.295
I did so many leg lifts,
I am exhausted.

17:12.297 --> 17:13.398
[Dani] Okay.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.433
Grace, do you work out?
Your body looks amazing.

17:18.435 --> 17:21.603
Yes, I just got
a personal trainer who costs

17:21.605 --> 17:24.773
a bazillion dollars, so I had to
get rid of my medical insurance,

17:24.776 --> 17:27.676
but, I'm 23, so, you know,
I don't need it.

17:27.679 --> 17:30.113
Yeah, it's working. You're hot.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.414
Thank you. [chuckles]

17:32.416 --> 17:36.251
Okay, everybody. Tomorrow I am making
breakfast for everybody, so...

17:36.253 --> 17:37.753
- [gasps] Okay.
- I don't eat gluten.

17:37.755 --> 17:41.794
Val, It's not 2008.
Nobody eats gluten.

17:45.563 --> 17:47.229
You knew my mother?

17:47.231 --> 17:49.132
[line reader] "She was
one of the bravest legends

17:49.134 --> 17:51.534
"to have protected
our planet, Spring."

17:51.536 --> 17:54.603
A legend?
But that would make me...

17:54.605 --> 17:56.508
[line reader] "A legend, yes."

17:58.476 --> 18:00.442
[casting director]
That was really great.

18:00.444 --> 18:03.513
- Thanks.
- [casting director] Yeah, that was great.

18:03.515 --> 18:04.913
Let's try it one more time.

18:04.915 --> 18:06.481
Okay, yeah, I'd love to.

18:06.483 --> 18:08.217
Do you want me to try
anything different, or...

18:08.219 --> 18:09.251
- [casting director] Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:09.253 --> 18:11.386
[casting director] Yeah, yeah.

18:11.388 --> 18:14.356
This time, let's play it as if, like,
no matter what the Oracle says,

18:14.358 --> 18:15.725
you... you just had enough.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.728
You just wanna get
out of this war.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.662
Okay. So it's not, like, it's not,
like, good news, it's just...

18:20.664 --> 18:25.367
[casting director] No, it's
more frustration, urgency.

18:25.369 --> 18:26.838
Okay, okay, great,
thank you. Yeah.

18:30.741 --> 18:32.374
[moaning]

18:32.376 --> 18:34.610
Oh, I've been wanting
to do this all morning.

18:34.612 --> 18:37.212
I know, I was looking at you in the
backseat and I just wanted to bang you.

18:37.214 --> 18:39.849
Then why were you being all
flirty with Dani this morning?

18:39.851 --> 18:40.749
I wasn't.

18:40.751 --> 18:42.218
Yeah, I was gonna gag.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.419
Do you think she's prettier
than me?

18:43.421 --> 18:44.653
Um, no.

18:44.655 --> 18:47.923
- Seriously?
- No, I said no.

18:47.925 --> 18:49.227
Okay.

18:52.864 --> 18:53.763
Do you think
she knows about us?

18:53.765 --> 18:55.797
[thud]

18:55.799 --> 18:57.732
Nah. No.

18:57.734 --> 18:59.568
Okay, yeah,
you're probably right.

18:59.570 --> 19:00.937
We should try and keep
it on the down low, too.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.738
I really don't want
Dani to get hurt.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.207
Okay, cool, whatever, yeah.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.209
- Oh, you're so sweet.
- Yeah.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.610
Are we gonna fool
around some more?

19:07.612 --> 19:09.312
'Cause I livestream
in like 23 minutes.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.481
Fine.

19:11.682 --> 19:15.651
[soft music]

19:15.653 --> 19:18.323
[Dani] Yes, I'm starving.

19:24.295 --> 19:26.265
Yeah, that smells fab.

19:27.632 --> 19:29.398
[Ricky] Yes.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.767
Thank you.

19:31.769 --> 19:33.372
Oh, my God, yes.

19:35.405 --> 19:36.838
Hm?

19:36.840 --> 19:39.441
No, if I even smell it,
I'll gain five pounds.

19:39.443 --> 19:41.509
Yo, everyone on my social
is talking about

19:41.511 --> 19:43.613
the stupid movie,
Legends of the Spring.

19:43.615 --> 19:46.649
Oh yeah, I think everyone in L.A.
has auditioned for it.

19:46.651 --> 19:48.316
It's like,
it's supposed to be huge.

19:48.318 --> 19:49.919
- Did you audition?
- Yeah.

19:49.921 --> 19:52.854
My agent is like best friends
with the casting director.

19:52.856 --> 19:53.989
Oh, who'd you go up for?

19:53.991 --> 19:55.958
- Skye.
- So did I.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.861
- Really?
- I auditioned for Silver.

19:58.863 --> 20:00.997
Yeah, but they announced
that Zac Efron got it, so...

20:00.999 --> 20:04.267
I'm gonna see if I can get, like,
a featured extra role in it.

20:04.269 --> 20:07.503
Those big movies,
they always go into overtime.

20:07.505 --> 20:08.970
I auditioned, too.

20:08.972 --> 20:12.574
I thought your agent
never got you anything good?

20:12.576 --> 20:13.742
I know, I need to fire him.

20:13.744 --> 20:15.346
But yeah,
I went in for Skye too.

20:16.614 --> 20:17.813
[tense music]

20:17.815 --> 20:20.615
- You auditioned for Skye?
- Yeah.

20:20.617 --> 20:22.351
Are you sure?
That's the lead.

20:22.353 --> 20:24.286
Yeah, I know.
I know I'm not gonna get it.

20:24.288 --> 20:26.354
Well yeah,
obviously, but I mean,

20:26.356 --> 20:28.958
that's great, though, that you
even went out for an audition.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.926
Yeah, it was pretty sick.

20:30.928 --> 20:31.893
How did it go?

20:31.895 --> 20:32.995
I don't know, fine.

20:32.997 --> 20:34.729
What about you Val?

20:34.731 --> 20:36.665
Um, you know,
I think they really liked me.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.968
They asked me to read twice,
once with direction, so...

20:38.970 --> 20:40.670
Wow. I only read once.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.971
Oh, shitty.
That's not a good sign.

20:42.973 --> 20:44.873
Well, I thought
maybe they liked it

20:44.875 --> 20:46.976
and they didn't need
to see more.

20:46.978 --> 20:48.576
I don't know,
I think Val's right.

20:48.578 --> 20:50.680
I think reading once
isn't good.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.717
Oh.

20:53.050 --> 20:55.317
You know what?

20:55.319 --> 20:56.419
You probably just didn't have
the look they were going for.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.754
That happens all the time.

20:58.756 --> 21:01.623
Or, you know, maybe you just
didn't get the character at all,

21:01.625 --> 21:02.725
but, don't worry about it.

21:02.727 --> 21:04.093
No, I'm not worried.

21:04.095 --> 21:05.795
I audition four or five times
a week, so,

21:05.797 --> 21:07.662
- I'll get something.
- Every week?

21:07.664 --> 21:09.664
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I think I do about the same.

21:09.666 --> 21:11.534
- I definitely go in for more.
- More?

21:11.536 --> 21:14.670
Yeah. Between like,
music videos, feature films,

21:14.672 --> 21:16.872
pilots, TV shows. For sure.

21:16.874 --> 21:19.674
Ricky, what about you?
How many do you go in for?

21:19.676 --> 21:20.976
Uh, [clears throat],
yeah, I'm focusing on

21:20.978 --> 21:22.478
a lot of stand up right now,
you know?

21:22.480 --> 21:24.646
I'm doing that,
so not as much.

21:24.648 --> 21:26.047
He doesn't really
get offered much.

21:26.049 --> 21:27.583
- [laughing]
- I turn them down.

21:27.585 --> 21:29.719
It's different
when you turn them down.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.120
What about you Val?

21:31.122 --> 21:33.689
Oh, I don't like to say.
It's personal.

21:33.691 --> 21:34.556
That means not very many.

21:34.558 --> 21:35.958
[laughing]

21:35.960 --> 21:38.561
It's about the quality,
not the quantity, okay?

21:38.563 --> 21:42.498
I only go out for roles
that will further my career.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.500
Unlike all those shitty indie
horror movies you go out for, Dani.

21:45.502 --> 21:46.901
Hey, I just wanna work.

21:46.903 --> 21:47.969
So whatever.

21:47.971 --> 21:50.041
[tense music]

21:53.577 --> 21:55.745
[camera clicking]

21:55.747 --> 21:59.148
- We good?
- [casting director] Yes.

21:59.150 --> 22:03.451
I just have a question before
we start, if that's okay?

22:03.453 --> 22:06.020
[casting director sighs]
Okay.

22:06.022 --> 22:09.624
Cool, so I'm just wondering, what
is my motivation in this scene?

22:09.626 --> 22:12.995
'Cause I didn't really get that
much information in the sides.

22:12.997 --> 22:15.698
[casting director] Well, your
spaceship has just been hit,

22:15.700 --> 22:17.102
and you're probably gonna die.

22:19.069 --> 22:20.669
Amazing.
I can totally work with that.

22:20.671 --> 22:22.036
[casting director]
Are you ready?

22:22.038 --> 22:22.874
[clearing throat]

22:25.609 --> 22:27.078
Mayday!

22:29.579 --> 22:31.015
[casting director]
Okay, again.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.549
Mayday!

22:34.551 --> 22:38.421
[casting director]
A little more on voice please.

22:38.423 --> 22:39.587
Mayday!

22:39.589 --> 22:40.655
[casting director]
A little louder.

22:40.657 --> 22:42.658
Mayday!

22:42.660 --> 22:43.659
[casting director]
A little quieter.

22:43.661 --> 22:44.927
[whispers] Mayday.

22:44.929 --> 22:46.862
- [casting director] Louder.
- Mayday!

22:46.864 --> 22:48.596
[casting director] Okay.

22:48.598 --> 22:51.736
Could you try it
facing your right, please?

22:54.538 --> 22:56.641
Mayday! [gasps]

23:01.979 --> 23:04.779
[fire crackling]

23:04.781 --> 23:06.650
Nope, not done. Nope.

23:13.191 --> 23:15.458
Guys, do you know
who they should cast

23:15.460 --> 23:17.959
in the new
Legends of the Spring movie?

23:17.961 --> 23:19.461
Tatiana Mislani.

23:19.463 --> 23:21.564
- Yes.
- I love her.

23:21.566 --> 23:25.167
Oh my God, she is so talented
and amazing. I hate her.

23:25.169 --> 23:28.069
I was taking a class
and she dropped in.

23:28.071 --> 23:30.538
I got to act out
a scene with her,

23:30.540 --> 23:33.909
and I was so nervous
that I threw up all over her.

23:33.911 --> 23:37.813
I think that she thought
I was really in character.

23:37.815 --> 23:39.148
I was playing a pregnant woman.

23:39.150 --> 23:41.115
Who's Tatiana Mislani?

23:41.117 --> 23:43.518
Do you live under
a rock or something?

23:43.520 --> 23:46.788
Only God's gift
to acting, that's who.

23:46.790 --> 23:49.190
You don't remember that
she retweeted me once?

23:49.192 --> 23:50.595
No, I don't remember.

23:52.230 --> 23:55.530
That's a very unflattering
quality of yours.

23:55.532 --> 23:58.234
What? That I don't know
who Tatiana Mislani is?

23:58.236 --> 23:59.235
Yes.

23:59.237 --> 24:01.769
Oh, my God, who cares?

24:01.771 --> 24:03.671
It's kind of
your job to know, Dani.

24:03.673 --> 24:06.609
- Like, this is your industry.
- It's part of being an actress.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.111
Okay, I don't know
one actress. Sorry.

24:09.113 --> 24:10.880
I don't mean to say
you're gonna work

24:10.882 --> 24:12.180
as hard as Tatiana Mislani,

24:12.182 --> 24:13.384
but you could put
a little bit of effort.

24:17.255 --> 24:19.057
- [fire crackling]
- [insects chirping]

24:20.657 --> 24:22.690
[Dani] Woo, yes.

24:22.692 --> 24:26.730
- [Ricky] Dani Nichols, surprise, surprise.
- [Dani] Yeah, drink up.

24:27.898 --> 24:28.933
Okay.

24:30.867 --> 24:32.037
Ready?

24:33.570 --> 24:34.603
Yes.

24:34.605 --> 24:35.304
That's your queen, bitch.

24:35.306 --> 24:36.971
My cards are crap.

24:36.973 --> 24:37.907
I don't think you
shuffled the deck enough.

24:37.909 --> 24:39.074
Oh, come on.

24:39.076 --> 24:39.941
What do you want from me?

24:39.943 --> 24:41.744
[laughing]

24:41.746 --> 24:42.814
Okay.

24:44.915 --> 24:46.047
- [group sighing]
- That's right.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.153
Drink up bitches.

24:49.653 --> 24:51.586
[clears throat]

24:51.588 --> 24:52.490
Ready?

24:54.258 --> 24:55.724
Ah!

24:55.726 --> 24:58.693
Guys, I am so good
at this game.

24:58.695 --> 25:01.229
You can't be good at War.
It's all luck.

25:01.231 --> 25:03.265
Well, then, I am really
good at being lucky.

25:03.267 --> 25:04.866
[scoffing]

25:04.868 --> 25:06.634
[upbeat hip hop music playing]

25:06.636 --> 25:07.969
Oh.

25:07.971 --> 25:10.573
War, war, war.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.544
[Ricky, Stefano, and Grace]
War, war, war, war, war, war.

25:14.311 --> 25:16.978
[yelling]

25:16.980 --> 25:18.713
- This game is stupid.
- I win.

25:18.715 --> 25:20.282
I win.

25:20.284 --> 25:23.651
Okay, I have something way
better than this card game.

25:23.653 --> 25:25.720
New head shots just came in.

25:25.722 --> 25:28.626
Medium close-up, pursed lips.

25:30.928 --> 25:33.761
White background.

25:33.763 --> 25:35.029
[Stefano] Wow.

25:35.031 --> 25:37.099
[Valerie] Yeah,
it's super classy.

25:37.101 --> 25:40.171
I just really wanted my features
to stand out, you know, like...

25:42.073 --> 25:43.671
Yeah, not bad.

25:43.673 --> 25:46.010
Well, since we're sharing.

25:48.378 --> 25:49.644
[tense music]

25:49.646 --> 25:51.080
[Ricky] Oh.

25:51.082 --> 25:53.215
Dude. Didn't you get
new head shots like,

25:53.217 --> 25:54.382
in the beginning of the year?

25:54.384 --> 25:56.218
Yeah, but my hair
grew an inch so,

25:56.220 --> 25:57.620
I wanted some new ones.

25:57.622 --> 25:58.921
Fair.

25:58.923 --> 26:01.323
That's very impressive.

26:01.325 --> 26:02.924
- Yes.
- [clears throat]

26:02.926 --> 26:04.793
So.

26:04.795 --> 26:06.161
[tense music]

26:06.163 --> 26:07.198
[Ricky] Black and white.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.400
Fuck.

26:11.402 --> 26:12.770
Guys.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.873
[tense music]

26:17.875 --> 26:19.941
[Valerie] You did
natural lighting?

26:19.943 --> 26:22.777
With your skin tone?

26:22.779 --> 26:25.648
- You're so brave.
- [chuckles]

26:25.650 --> 26:27.982
Dani, what about you?

26:27.984 --> 26:29.985
Oh. Yep. Uh...

26:29.987 --> 26:31.221
[tense music]

26:41.332 --> 26:43.265
[tense music]

26:43.267 --> 26:45.703
Dani, that's your
driver's license photo.

26:46.936 --> 26:48.370
Yeah. No, I know.

26:48.372 --> 26:50.139
Um, I think head
shots are stupid.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.007
Why am I spending hundreds
of dollars on something

26:52.009 --> 26:53.342
when that photo's fine?

26:53.344 --> 26:56.347
- [heart beating]
- [tense music]

26:57.847 --> 26:59.280
- It's nice.
- [phone dropping]

26:59.282 --> 27:00.682
Val.

27:00.684 --> 27:02.684
Oh, shoot, sorry.

27:02.686 --> 27:04.119
That's okay.

27:04.121 --> 27:07.322
It's a good thing I got
this water case on it.

27:07.324 --> 27:08.891
[sighs]

27:08.893 --> 27:11.994
So, like, tough?

27:11.996 --> 27:14.430
[casting director]
Uh, more like...

27:14.432 --> 27:19.067
you want to kiss the girl
after you save the world?

27:19.069 --> 27:20.736
Right.

27:20.738 --> 27:22.970
- Sure, easy.
- [casting director] Great.

27:22.972 --> 27:24.873
- No problem.
- [casting director] Just take it again.

27:24.875 --> 27:25.876
[clearing throat]

27:29.980 --> 27:31.479
The rebels are
moving in quickly.

27:31.481 --> 27:33.047
[line reader] "There
are too many of them.

27:33.049 --> 27:35.316
"We won't make it."

27:35.318 --> 27:37.119
Sorry.
[clearing throat]

27:37.121 --> 27:39.220
The rebels are
moving in quickly.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.123
[line reader] "There are too many of them.
"We won't make it."

27:41.125 --> 27:42.794
I have an idea,
but you aren't gonna like it.

27:44.260 --> 27:47.296
[casting director] Okay,
no, I'm not buying that.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.163
I'm not buying that you
wanna kiss the girl after.

27:49.165 --> 27:50.798
Do you know
what I mean by that?

27:50.800 --> 27:51.999
- Okay.
- [casting director] Can we just,

27:52.001 --> 27:54.769
just hear that last line again,
please?

27:54.771 --> 27:56.106
- Sure.
- [casting director] Okay.

27:59.943 --> 28:02.279
We'll be together again,
I promise.

28:07.984 --> 28:09.918
I have a bit of a cold.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.723
It's probably
affecting my voice.

28:14.357 --> 28:15.457
[casting director] Okay,
thank you for coming in.

28:15.459 --> 28:17.226
Thank you.

28:17.228 --> 28:19.297
[casting director] Uh, can
I just make one suggestion?

28:22.098 --> 28:23.498
Hide it.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.735
Thanks.

28:27.837 --> 28:30.075
- [soft music]
- [insects chirping]

28:42.318 --> 28:43.922
Thanks.

28:47.057 --> 28:48.824
[Dani] So you've
been kind of quiet.

28:48.826 --> 28:50.491
Normally you're
the life of the party.

28:50.493 --> 28:51.927
Have I been?

28:51.929 --> 28:53.428
I haven't really noticed.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.967
Well, I don't know,
maybe only I notice that.

29:01.971 --> 29:05.073
Ricky told me you
and Michelle broke up.

29:05.075 --> 29:06.941
Yeah.

29:06.943 --> 29:08.410
Yeah.

29:08.412 --> 29:10.379
We weren't
really dating, though.

29:10.381 --> 29:12.413
Sort of stopped talking.

29:12.415 --> 29:13.917
- [Dani] Right.
- Yeah.

29:16.186 --> 29:17.451
Is that it though?

29:17.453 --> 29:18.821
Is that what?

29:18.823 --> 29:19.758
[Dani] Why you've been quiet?

29:23.027 --> 29:24.062
Yep.

29:28.865 --> 29:30.268
Oh, it's kind of cold.

29:31.969 --> 29:34.169
I'm gonna head back inside.

29:34.171 --> 29:36.074
Okay, Stephen Tarnick?

29:50.320 --> 29:53.390
[crackling]

29:56.026 --> 29:57.959
[yawning]
Morning ladies.

29:57.961 --> 30:00.929
Damn, I'm so mad at you.

30:00.931 --> 30:02.396
How could you do this to me?

30:02.398 --> 30:04.399
What's up with her?

30:04.401 --> 30:07.469
She said she's preparing
for some audition next week.

30:07.471 --> 30:11.073
Is this why she's doing
this British accent again?

30:11.075 --> 30:12.507
- Yep.
- [laughing]

30:12.509 --> 30:13.507
What's this one for?

30:13.509 --> 30:15.110
Um.

30:15.112 --> 30:17.446
Some reenactment show.

30:17.448 --> 30:20.215
Murderous Wives or something.
I don't fuckin' know.

30:20.217 --> 30:23.919
She is so weird.

30:23.921 --> 30:24.920
Is that Daniel?

30:24.922 --> 30:26.488
That lying sack of shit.

30:26.490 --> 30:29.227
I can't believe
you'd do this our children.

30:32.162 --> 30:34.328
Can I slap her
if she does this all weekend?

30:34.330 --> 30:37.431
I honestly don't know how
much more of this I can take.

30:37.433 --> 30:39.167
- Like seriously.
- [phone ringing]

30:39.169 --> 30:41.003
Who's calling Dani this early?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.904
I don't know. Her phone's been
buzzing all morning.

30:42.906 --> 30:44.640
Someone's desperately
trying to get ahold of her.

30:44.642 --> 30:47.609
Weird.
I hope everything's okay.

30:47.611 --> 30:49.378
Yo, morning.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.078
Morning Ricky.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.180
Where is Dani?

30:53.182 --> 30:55.517
Resting.

30:55.519 --> 30:58.253
Okay, well, breakfast
is ready soon, so...

30:58.255 --> 31:00.354
She doesn't care if it's cold.
We can go ahead.

31:00.356 --> 31:03.057
No, we're gonna
eat all together.

31:03.059 --> 31:05.160
We discussed this yesterday.

31:05.162 --> 31:06.527
No...

31:06.529 --> 31:08.162
Come on.
We're waiting for Dani.

31:08.164 --> 31:09.030
Why?

31:09.032 --> 31:10.532
Okay.

31:10.534 --> 31:12.437
I'm just gonna go get her.
This is ridiculous.

31:14.337 --> 31:15.671
Let's just eat.

31:15.673 --> 31:16.671
Good morning.

31:16.673 --> 31:19.440
- Mmmm.
- Welcome.

31:19.442 --> 31:21.242
Your phone's been
blowing up all morning.

31:21.244 --> 31:22.980
You have like a hundred
missed voicemails.

31:24.515 --> 31:26.014
Who, me?

31:26.016 --> 31:28.115
I bet it's Daniel!
That cheater!

31:28.117 --> 31:29.985
Just, okay?

31:29.987 --> 31:32.156
Five missed calls
from my agent.

31:33.523 --> 31:35.324
- 10 bucks, butt dial.
- [line ringing]

31:35.326 --> 31:38.192
Dani, can you just
do that later, please?

31:38.194 --> 31:40.661
Five missed calls
from an agent on a Saturday?

31:40.663 --> 31:42.264
I hope she's not getting fired.

31:42.266 --> 31:43.230
Yeah.

31:43.232 --> 31:45.267
An agent can't fire you.

31:45.269 --> 31:47.035
Yeah, if you're
not booking anything,

31:47.037 --> 31:48.303
- they can just let you go.
- [Grace] What?

31:48.305 --> 31:49.571
I didn't know that.

31:49.573 --> 31:51.506
Yeah. It happened
to my friend once.

31:51.508 --> 31:53.607
He didn't book something
for like two years,

31:53.609 --> 31:55.142
and they just
terminated his contract.

31:55.144 --> 31:57.048
[Dani happily screaming]

32:00.284 --> 32:02.116
Guess who just
got offered the lead

32:02.118 --> 32:03.719
in Legends of the, uh...

32:03.721 --> 32:04.686
Spring?

32:04.688 --> 32:06.587
Yes!

32:06.589 --> 32:08.123
Tatiana Mislani?

32:08.125 --> 32:10.558
No.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.428
[distorted] Me.

32:13.430 --> 32:17.501
[buzzing]

32:20.770 --> 32:23.374
[no audible dialogue]

32:30.413 --> 32:35.452
[orchestral music]

32:38.388 --> 32:42.559
[screams]

32:53.103 --> 32:55.036
[Dani] My agent's just
finalizing the deal.

32:55.038 --> 32:56.337
No, no, no, no,
don't come pick me up.

32:56.339 --> 32:57.738
I can just take a cab.

32:57.740 --> 33:00.609
I'm not sure, but, like,
at least seven figures.

33:00.611 --> 33:04.211
Oh, mom, I know.
I'm so proud of me, too.

33:04.213 --> 33:06.314
[birds chirping]

33:06.316 --> 33:07.716
[exhales]

33:07.718 --> 33:10.218
Uh, so, good news but bad news.

33:10.220 --> 33:14.122
My mom is throwing me a party
but wants to do it tomorrow

33:14.124 --> 33:17.058
because, since Monday, everything's
gonna be insane for me.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.459
[clears throat]

33:18.461 --> 33:20.327
We have the cottage
'til Monday though.

33:20.329 --> 33:22.163
Oh, oh my God, no, no, no,
you guys don't have to come.

33:22.165 --> 33:24.399
It's mainly just like a...
like a family party

33:24.401 --> 33:26.468
and there'll be like a few
of my closest friends there

33:26.470 --> 33:28.737
from high school, but... but I'll
just leave early in the morning

33:28.739 --> 33:30.173
and you guys
can stay 'til Monday.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.708
[chuckling]
Well...

33:33.710 --> 33:35.844
I guess we should
celebrate now, then?

33:35.846 --> 33:37.446
- Yes.
- Right?

33:37.448 --> 33:38.580
Maybe?

33:38.582 --> 33:40.681
- Okay.
- Cheers?

33:40.683 --> 33:41.850
Oh, yeah.

33:41.852 --> 33:43.418
To that.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.686
Wow.

33:44.688 --> 33:46.254
- Can you guys believe it?
- [laughs]

33:46.256 --> 33:47.823
Legends of the Fall.

33:47.825 --> 33:49.324
Legends of the Spring.

33:49.326 --> 33:51.559
Right, right, whatever.

33:51.561 --> 33:53.361
[Grace] So do you have
to read the books now?

33:53.363 --> 33:55.831
I read all of them
to prepare for my audition.

33:55.833 --> 33:57.833
I can lend them to you.

33:57.835 --> 33:59.633
I mean, I hope not.

33:59.635 --> 34:01.736
I'll be lucky if I make it
through the entire script.

34:01.738 --> 34:04.738
[chuckling]

34:04.740 --> 34:07.142
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

34:07.144 --> 34:08.476
Not really.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.313
- [deeply inhaling]
- [Grace] Oh.

34:12.181 --> 34:13.514
You should really
read the books.

34:13.516 --> 34:15.349
I wrote little notes
in all the margins.

34:15.351 --> 34:18.152
I really dug
into Skye's psyche.

34:18.155 --> 34:20.487
I wanted to be super
prepared for the audition.

34:20.489 --> 34:23.858
Maybe you can read them and we
can talk about it together.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.527
I mean, I'll probably
just play her the way

34:26.530 --> 34:28.496
- I wanna play her, you know?
- [knife scraping]

34:28.498 --> 34:30.801
I mean, maybe I'll read the
Wikipedia summaries or something.

34:34.871 --> 34:38.742
Oh. Yeah. That... sure.

34:42.713 --> 34:46.347
So can I ask, how did you
prepare for the audition?

34:46.349 --> 34:47.849
I actually don't know
any actors

34:47.851 --> 34:50.284
who have booked a huge role
like this.

34:50.286 --> 34:53.688
Grace, thank you, I'm touched.
That's so nice of you to ask, guys.

34:53.690 --> 34:56.391
Oh, well, I mean,

34:56.393 --> 34:57.791
um, it was tough.

34:57.793 --> 34:59.561
It was, it was tough.

34:59.563 --> 35:01.396
I mean, I found out the day
before about the audition

35:01.398 --> 35:03.865
and my agent sent me the sides,

35:03.867 --> 35:07.369
but I actually, I had plans that
night to go to clubbing with Juju.

35:07.371 --> 35:09.170
Did you know Juju?

35:09.172 --> 35:10.704
No, I don't know Juju.

35:10.706 --> 35:12.407
Oh my God, next
time we go out,

35:12.409 --> 35:14.642
you should totally come.
You would love her.

35:14.644 --> 35:16.744
Wait, if I'm allowed to go out,

35:16.746 --> 35:18.579
because, you know
when the press start

35:18.581 --> 35:20.414
finding out all this stuff,
oh, my God.

35:20.416 --> 35:23.784
[chuckles] Ah, I mean,
anyways, anyways.

35:23.786 --> 35:26.320
So I couldn't actually
memorize the sides,

35:26.322 --> 35:27.789
and I also forgot
to set my alarm, so,

35:27.791 --> 35:29.356
I woke up late.

35:29.358 --> 35:31.860
And... so I just about
had time to shower.

35:31.862 --> 35:33.195
I didn't do my hair or makeup.

35:33.197 --> 35:34.695
- Didn't have time.
- What?

35:34.697 --> 35:38.599
Am, but yeah, so I got
there and there was like...

35:38.601 --> 35:40.969
like a million girls there.

35:40.971 --> 35:43.671
But I went in, read my lines,

35:43.673 --> 35:45.941
and they were like,
"Wow that's so great.

35:45.943 --> 35:47.976
"Would you mind staying
back and reading with Zac?"

35:47.978 --> 35:49.911
- So I...
- Efron?

35:49.913 --> 35:51.713
Yeah, yeah.

35:51.715 --> 35:54.648
You know, so I waited
like an hour or two

35:54.650 --> 35:58.653
and went back in
and, uh, I read with Zac.

35:58.655 --> 36:01.590
It went really well,
and he was like, I quote,

36:01.592 --> 36:05.559
"You are like so gorgeous."

36:05.561 --> 36:06.894
And I was like,
"Oh my God, so are you,"

36:06.896 --> 36:09.496
and uh, that was like...
that was like it.

36:09.498 --> 36:11.432
[clearing throat]

36:11.434 --> 36:12.766
You are gorgeous.

36:12.768 --> 36:14.271
The most gorgeous.

36:16.306 --> 36:18.305
I'm just gonna
go get some water.

36:18.307 --> 36:20.641
[chair scraping]

36:20.643 --> 36:21.675
I said that.

36:21.677 --> 36:23.478
[chuckles]

36:23.480 --> 36:29.650
[door slides open and closed]

36:29.652 --> 36:34.925
[Grace screaming]

36:36.960 --> 36:38.492
What?

36:38.494 --> 36:43.233
[door slides open and closed]

36:45.335 --> 36:46.867
Are you okay?

36:46.869 --> 36:49.606
What? Oh yeah,
we're out of water.

36:57.614 --> 36:59.847
You...

36:59.849 --> 37:01.383
you knew my mother?

37:01.385 --> 37:02.349
[casting director] Okay, stop.

37:02.351 --> 37:04.619
Um, what's happening?

37:04.621 --> 37:07.588
Oh, well, in the third book, when we
find out her mother actually leaves...

37:07.590 --> 37:10.358
[casting director] That doesn't
really matter right now.

37:10.360 --> 37:16.030
Could you, um,
just pull it back a little?

37:16.032 --> 37:16.998
Yeah, sorry.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.800
[casting director] Great.

37:18.802 --> 37:24.371
Okay, um, let's do
the scene a little more sexy.

37:24.373 --> 37:25.572
Sexy?

37:25.574 --> 37:27.374
- Sure.
- [casting director] Great.

37:27.376 --> 37:31.079
So, let's go
for your next line.

37:31.081 --> 37:33.081
[exhales]

37:33.083 --> 37:34.849
A legend?

37:34.851 --> 37:37.818
- But that would make me...
- [line reader] "A legend? Yes."

37:37.820 --> 37:40.354
[sighing]

37:40.356 --> 37:41.925
"It's time to
protect your home."

37:50.733 --> 37:55.436
[casting director] So where is your
listed filmography on your resume?

37:55.438 --> 37:57.005
I have all my training
and classwork

37:57.007 --> 37:58.673
right at the top there.

37:58.675 --> 38:02.543
[casting director]
But where is your filmography?

38:02.545 --> 38:05.780
I actually,
I haven't been officially

38:05.782 --> 38:07.581
cast in anything yet, but...

38:07.583 --> 38:11.019
[casting director] You've
never been cast in a role?

38:11.021 --> 38:13.854
No.

38:13.856 --> 38:14.956
[casting director]
Thank you for coming in.

38:14.958 --> 38:17.595
[water running]

38:21.063 --> 38:22.932
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

38:25.601 --> 38:28.570
I can't believe
she's not gonna read the books.

38:28.572 --> 38:30.572
Does that really
surprise you, though?

38:30.574 --> 38:32.840
I mean, I'm just
surprised she even made it

38:32.842 --> 38:34.641
- to the audition on time.
- [both chuckle]

38:34.643 --> 38:36.043
And the fact that
they booked her

38:36.045 --> 38:38.079
off of
that driver's license photo?

38:38.081 --> 38:39.680
Right?

38:39.682 --> 38:41.782
You know, I'm happy for Dani
and everything,

38:41.784 --> 38:43.617
but like, I wouldn't
even want that role.

38:43.619 --> 38:45.420
What, why?

38:45.422 --> 38:46.720
When you book
a role like that,

38:46.722 --> 38:48.690
your career is basically over.

38:48.692 --> 38:51.126
- But...
- You just get typecast, and I don't wanna play

38:51.128 --> 38:53.427
the same role
for the rest of my life.

38:53.429 --> 38:55.996
- But I don't know if that's...
- I'm more about creating art

38:55.998 --> 39:00.668
and doing roles that really have
an impact on people's lives.

39:00.670 --> 39:03.637
If I went my entire career
and no one ever knew my name,

39:03.639 --> 39:05.407
I honestly wouldn't care.

39:05.409 --> 39:06.673
Really?

39:06.675 --> 39:08.075
Mm-hmm.

39:08.077 --> 39:11.512
Dani booking this role
actually benefits me.

39:11.514 --> 39:12.914
Huh.

39:12.916 --> 39:16.418
It just proves
I need to hone my skills more.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.186
I need to look forward.

39:18.188 --> 39:21.726
And next is my audition
next week for Murderous Wives.

39:23.893 --> 39:25.559
You know what?

39:25.561 --> 39:28.563
That's a pretty great
perspective to have.

39:28.565 --> 39:31.599
And the fact that you've been
doing this accent all weekend?

39:31.601 --> 39:32.934
I'm actually really impressed.

39:32.936 --> 39:35.170
- Thank you.
- [Stefano] Yeah.

39:35.172 --> 39:38.539
Okay, so I'm auditioning
for Manjari Woswoli,

39:38.541 --> 39:41.443
a woman fighting
inner turmoil and darkness

39:41.445 --> 39:43.811
after she finds out
her husband is cheating on her

39:43.813 --> 39:45.847
with her best friend.

39:45.849 --> 39:47.684
You're auditioning
for an Indian woman?

39:49.820 --> 39:51.653
- That's the accent you've been doing all weekend?
- Yeah.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.755
Couldn't you tell?

39:53.757 --> 39:55.123
Totally.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.791
I think you nailed it.

39:56.793 --> 39:57.862
[chuckles]

40:07.603 --> 40:10.871
Babe, have I told you
how proud I am of you

40:10.873 --> 40:11.972
that you got this big role?

40:11.974 --> 40:14.041
Um, no.

40:14.043 --> 40:15.476
Well, I am.

40:15.478 --> 40:16.811
Remember when I told you

40:16.813 --> 40:18.746
we were gonna be
the Kimye of our generation?

40:18.748 --> 40:19.981
Uh-huh.

40:19.983 --> 40:23.117
I'm thinkin' sex tape.

40:23.119 --> 40:24.751
- [laughing]
- And then we put it on YouTube.

40:24.753 --> 40:26.990
Uh, no, maybe not now.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.626
This is it, though.

40:32.628 --> 40:34.695
You know, you're in.

40:34.697 --> 40:36.630
Do you think that you
can probably put in

40:36.632 --> 40:38.666
a good word with me
with some producers and shit?

40:38.668 --> 40:41.168
Um, I mean, probably.

40:41.170 --> 40:42.903
- Yeah.
- Sure.

40:42.905 --> 40:45.606
And when they release
that you're playing Skye,

40:45.608 --> 40:47.175
do you think that you
can probably, like,

40:47.177 --> 40:48.742
at me in your tweets?

40:48.744 --> 40:50.244
Uh, yeah.

40:50.246 --> 40:52.213
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

40:52.215 --> 40:53.684
I love you.

40:58.655 --> 41:00.921
[Valerie] Stefano?

41:00.923 --> 41:03.925
Stefano, wait.

41:03.927 --> 41:06.193
Stefano?

41:06.195 --> 41:07.996
Hey, can you slow down?

41:07.998 --> 41:10.097
Sorry.
Pace I normally go at.

41:10.099 --> 41:12.066
- You're slowing me down.
- [sighs]

41:12.068 --> 41:14.769
I can't go that fast.
Your legs are longer than mine.

41:14.771 --> 41:16.905
Sorry, can't slow down.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.273
Stefano. [sighs]

41:19.275 --> 41:21.708
Obviously something is
bothering you so just say it.

41:21.710 --> 41:23.110
Nothing's bothering me.

41:23.112 --> 41:25.012
Come on, I'm not an idiot.
You can tell me.

41:25.014 --> 41:27.548
If I had something
to say, I would just say it.

41:27.550 --> 41:29.117
You think I'm incapable
of expressing how I feel?

41:29.119 --> 41:30.784
- Well...
- You don't know anything about me.

41:30.786 --> 41:32.287
What is wrong with you?

41:32.289 --> 41:33.787
Nothing is wrong with me.

41:33.789 --> 41:35.492
I'm completely normal.

41:43.867 --> 41:48.706
[soft music]

41:56.713 --> 41:59.112
Have you ever seen anything
that Dani's been in?

41:59.114 --> 42:00.615
Like, acting?

42:00.617 --> 42:02.215
We did Grease together
in high school.

42:02.217 --> 42:04.251
Who did Dani play?

42:04.253 --> 42:05.853
Jan.

42:05.855 --> 42:08.255
- That's so sad.
- I know.

42:08.257 --> 42:10.693
But have you seen
anything more recent?

42:12.262 --> 42:14.329
Is that a bad thing?

42:14.331 --> 42:17.898
She sent me the pilot
of this web series she was in

42:17.900 --> 42:20.101
and I watched like
the first 30 seconds of it.

42:20.103 --> 42:22.670
- Don't tell her I said this...
- I won't.

42:22.672 --> 42:24.271
...but I had to turn it off.

42:24.273 --> 42:26.907
It was so bad, I was starting
to lose respect for her.

42:26.909 --> 42:28.943
Are you talking
about Camp Death?

42:28.945 --> 42:30.778
This web horror
series where, like,

42:30.780 --> 42:32.347
a bunch of Jewish
kids go to a camp

that have been made?

42:44.226 --> 42:46.126
Yeah.

It's just a little shocking
to me that she got that role.

42:49.398 --> 42:52.900
I don't know.
She's always been lucky.

42:52.902 --> 42:54.302
It's actually not
that surprising.

42:54.304 --> 42:57.005

she was voted best hair.

42:57.007 --> 42:59.139
Best hair.

42:59.141 --> 43:01.141
She doesn't even
brush her hair.

43:01.143 --> 43:03.244
Yeah, and that's
the thing, though.

be about talent and hard work.

your own stunts then?

scene where I have to run,

No. I'm faking it.

44:41.277 --> 44:42.909

44:42.911 --> 44:44.378
Just, we gotta ride this out.

44:44.380 --> 44:47.280
Dani getting this role
is really big for me. Us.

44:47.282 --> 44:49.383
This is so stupid.

44:49.385 --> 44:52.353
You said you were 80 percent

44:52.355 --> 44:54.988
and now you're acting like you two
are on your fucking honeymoon.

44:54.990 --> 44:56.324
It's gonna make me throw up.

44:56.326 --> 44:57.958
Babe, chill.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.894
I don't have to do
this for much longer.

44:59.896 --> 45:02.764
Just like, eight months
and they shoot the movie.

45:02.766 --> 45:04.865
And then, well, they have to do
post on it,

45:04.867 --> 45:07.400
and make it awesome, so it'd
be like a year and a half.

45:07.402 --> 45:09.836
But then the movie comes out
and there's all the parties

45:09.838 --> 45:12.173

and the leverage and network,

45:12.175 --> 45:14.141

you to find out this way.

I can do better than Ricky.

- Here.
- Oh my god.

01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:23.371
[camera clicking]

01:07:30.478 --> 01:07:31.811
Grace?

01:07:31.813 --> 01:07:34.617
[tense music]

01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:47.395
Grace?

01:07:50.632 --> 01:07:52.134
Grace?

01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:55.804
Grace!

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:02.474
Dude?

01:08:02.476 --> 01:08:04.144
Fuck.

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:06.612
You scared me.

01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:07.549
What the fuck?

01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:10.816
Oh.

01:08:10.818 --> 01:08:12.684
I'd offer you some,
but I smoked it all.

01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:15.557
Why are you in the middle
of the woods by yourself?

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:21.393
- [Grace] Oh.
- How high are you?

01:08:21.395 --> 01:08:24.532
[laughing]

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.337
[insects chirping]

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:04.606
[sighs]

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.145
[indistinct talking]

01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:14.546
[Ricky, distorted]
What should we do?

01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:15.682
[Stefano, distorted]
Where was she?

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:17.216
[Ricky, distorted] In the woods.

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:18.218
[Valerie, distorted]
Why is she so weird?

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.885
[Ricky, distorted] No idea.

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:21.888
[Valerie, distorted] I don't
know if we can trust her.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.622
[Stefano, distorted] Yeah, we
don't even know her that well.

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.291
[Ricky, distorted] She smoked
like two entire joints

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:28.493
and didn't even
save some for me.

01:09:28.496 --> 01:09:30.263
Us. Didn't save any for us.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.564
[Valerie, distorted]
Where's Dani's phone?

01:09:32.567 --> 01:09:34.834
[Stefano, distorted] I still have it.
I'm not letting it out of my sight.

01:09:34.836 --> 01:09:38.470
[tense music]

01:09:38.471 --> 01:09:42.741
[Valerie, distorted] I can't believe you
would even show your face right now.

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:44.277
[Valerie] Excuse me?

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.246
[distorted] I caught you
and Ricky fucking.

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:48.515
[Valerie] So?

01:09:52.487 --> 01:09:55.821
I Googled what to do
when someone dies.

01:09:55.823 --> 01:09:57.889
- How stupid are you?
- Great.

01:09:57.891 --> 01:10:01.995
I'm actually asking. This
isn't a rhetorical question.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.729
Is this traceable?

01:10:03.731 --> 01:10:05.397
I don't know.

01:10:05.399 --> 01:10:06.699
[Ricky]
Delete her search history.

01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:08.800
Fuck how?
Grace, what the fuck?

01:10:08.802 --> 01:10:10.503
Oh, guys.

01:10:10.505 --> 01:10:13.305
Maybe,
if the cops suspect anything,

01:10:13.307 --> 01:10:16.442
this is a good thing
'cause we can just blame her.

01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:19.981
You think anyone's gonna
believe that she killed her?

01:10:22.917 --> 01:10:27.620
Oh, right.
She might play the slow card.

01:10:27.622 --> 01:10:30.857
- What?
- She's slow, right?

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.392
[Ricky] No.

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.960
[Stefano] Really?

01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:36.562
Sorry.

01:10:36.564 --> 01:10:40.465
- [chuckles]
- [Ricky] What did you smoke?

01:10:40.467 --> 01:10:41.834
You didn't save any?

01:10:41.836 --> 01:10:47.676
- [water flowing]
- [slow operatic music]

01:11:03.324 --> 01:11:05.391
[Grace] I think
I'm still a little high.

01:11:05.393 --> 01:11:06.992
[Valerie] Grace, no one cares.

01:11:06.994 --> 01:11:08.995
[Stefano] Yeah, we have enough
to worry about right now.

01:11:08.997 --> 01:11:10.796
Thanks so much for all
your help last night, though.

01:11:10.798 --> 01:11:13.333
Oh, I'm sorry, I was upset.

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:15.434
And sometimes I get too high
when I'm upset.

01:11:15.436 --> 01:11:17.704
What do you even have to be upset about?
You barely even knew Dani.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:19.805
So? Dani and I were friends.

01:11:19.807 --> 01:11:23.576
[scoffs] Barely friends. You knew her what?
Like six months?

01:11:23.578 --> 01:11:25.977
I've known Dani for five years.

01:11:25.979 --> 01:11:28.580
I've lost my best friend.

01:11:28.582 --> 01:11:31.017
If anyone should be
the most upset, it's me.

01:11:31.019 --> 01:11:32.785
Excuse me?

01:11:32.787 --> 01:11:35.588
You think you should be
the most upset right now?

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:38.590
You and your measly
five year friendship?

01:11:38.592 --> 01:11:40.492
I've known Dani
since high school.

01:11:40.494 --> 01:11:43.095
We grew up together.
That's freshman year, okay?

01:11:43.097 --> 01:11:45.031
If anybody's
the most upset, it's me.

01:11:45.033 --> 01:11:46.933
That's cute.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:52.405
Maybe you guys forget this,
but Dani was my girlfriend.

01:11:52.407 --> 01:11:54.807
Oh, she was
your girlfriend now?

01:11:54.809 --> 01:11:57.009
I don't think you cared
very much about her

01:11:57.011 --> 01:11:58.577
when you were fucking
Val for three months.

01:11:58.579 --> 01:12:00.513
She said it.

01:12:00.515 --> 01:12:03.549
Dani and I may have only known
each other for six months,

01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:05.918
but how often
did you guys even see her?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.153
How often did she
ask you to hang out

01:12:08.155 --> 01:12:12.858
or send you something that she's
working on and you just ignored her?

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:16.495
I saw Dani
almost every single day.

01:12:16.497 --> 01:12:20.465
So yeah, I'm the most upset 'cause
Dani and I were the closest.

01:12:20.467 --> 01:12:23.535
Oh, please, you were just
another Juju, okay?

01:12:23.537 --> 01:12:25.737
I mean, Dani had
so many short term friends

01:12:25.739 --> 01:12:29.776
that she got obsessed with and then she
just got bored and tossed them away.

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:32.611
It's friends
like me who stuck around.

01:12:32.613 --> 01:12:36.182
I mean, just because I didn't see her
every day doesn't mean anything.

01:12:36.184 --> 01:12:37.884
Can we just all stop
arguing and agree

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:40.620
that I am clearly
Dani's best friend, period.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.955
No way, I was
her best friend, okay?

01:12:42.957 --> 01:12:44.589
You may have been
her longest friend,

01:12:44.591 --> 01:12:46.459
but that doesn't necessarily
equal best.

01:12:46.461 --> 01:12:48.561
- Yes, in this case it does.
- Nuh-uh, I don't think so.

01:12:48.563 --> 01:12:50.196
You didn't even trust her enough
to tell her that you were gay.

01:12:50.198 --> 01:12:51.430
Yes, I didn't tell her,
I was going to tell her.

01:12:51.432 --> 01:12:53.699
[Valerie] Are you kidding me?

01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:56.535
- Oh, did you ever tell her actually anything about you?
- I was getting there.

01:12:56.537 --> 01:12:57.903
No, because
you didn't talk to her

01:12:57.905 --> 01:12:59.571
because you didn't
hang out with her.

01:12:59.573 --> 01:13:01.072
Just because you worked
together at that taco shop.

01:13:01.074 --> 01:13:02.775
And you were
fucking her boyfriend.

01:13:02.777 --> 01:13:04.143
You're best friends
all of a sudden.

01:13:04.145 --> 01:13:05.745
Like seriously?

01:13:05.747 --> 01:13:06.912
[Stefano] History matters.

01:13:06.914 --> 01:13:09.982
[overlapping arguing]

01:13:09.984 --> 01:13:12.617
One good word about
Dani to me, okay?

01:13:12.619 --> 01:13:13.619
All you did was...

01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:14.519
You're the worst person.

01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:15.521
Guys.

01:13:15.523 --> 01:13:17.055
[overlapping arguing continues]

01:13:17.057 --> 01:13:18.493
Guys!

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.977
How does she still look so hot?

01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:39.512
[Ricky] Her skin looks amazing.

01:13:39.514 --> 01:13:41.680
I don't understand.

01:13:41.682 --> 01:13:45.087
Throw some dirt on her face. I can't
stand looking at her this hot.

01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:49.821
Okay, so what do we do now?

01:13:49.823 --> 01:13:51.757
- Are we going to jail?
- No.

01:13:51.759 --> 01:13:53.593
We gotta do something
with the body.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:55.961
Somebody's gonna see it.

01:13:55.963 --> 01:13:57.562
Let's bring her inside.

01:13:57.564 --> 01:13:59.932
No, she's gonna start to stink.

01:13:59.934 --> 01:14:01.901
Fuck.

01:14:01.903 --> 01:14:03.902
I have a bad
feeling about this.

01:14:03.904 --> 01:14:06.071
I'm like picturing it,
five years from now

01:14:06.073 --> 01:14:09.575
we're gonna be the subjects of one
of those Murderous Wives shows.

01:14:09.577 --> 01:14:12.077
I hope prison is like Orange
is the New Black, season one.

01:14:12.079 --> 01:14:15.281
Not four. If it's season
four, I'm gonna kill myself.

01:14:15.283 --> 01:14:17.148
[Dani's phone ringing]

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:19.585
Is that Dani's phone?

01:14:19.587 --> 01:14:21.521
Who's calling her?

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:22.787
Shit, it's her mom.

01:14:22.789 --> 01:14:24.156
Fuck.

01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:26.659
[phone ringing]

01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:30.696
[slow operatic music]

01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:32.732
[phone chiming]

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.901
She's supposed to have
her family party today

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:38.870
- to celebrate that stupid role that's gonna ruin her career.
- Fuck.

01:14:38.872 --> 01:14:41.773
Her mom's gonna notice
if she's not home in an hour.

01:14:41.775 --> 01:14:45.143
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:14:45.145 --> 01:14:47.746
- [phone chiming]
- What the fuck is it now?

01:14:47.748 --> 01:14:49.248
It's the same noise
from last night.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:50.916
I think it's the voicemail
notification.

01:14:50.918 --> 01:14:52.884
She has two new voicemails.

01:14:52.886 --> 01:14:54.620
One's from her agent.

01:14:54.622 --> 01:14:56.923
Should we listen to it?

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:59.558
Obviously, yes.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.759
[groaning]

01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:02.562
[beeps]

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:04.563
[voicemail] You have two
new voice messages.

01:15:04.565 --> 01:15:06.898
To listen to your messages,
press one.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:10.001
First new message
sent today at 10 am.

01:15:10.003 --> 01:15:12.671
[woman] Hey baby girl...

01:15:12.673 --> 01:15:16.808
[voicemail] Second new message
sent yesterday at 6:55 pm.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:18.777
[man] Hey kiddo. Bad news.

01:15:18.779 --> 01:15:21.013
The studio called
and it looks like they decided

01:15:21.015 --> 01:15:22.882
to go with Tatiana Mislani
instead.

01:15:22.884 --> 01:15:26.218
Oh, she's gonna be
so amazing in this role.

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.088
I know this is really
disappointing, but,

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:31.022
we just weren't able
to close the deal.

01:15:31.024 --> 01:15:33.326
Apparently they wanted
to go with Tatiana first

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:36.195
but she had a conflict and now
her schedule has opened up.

01:15:36.197 --> 01:15:37.996
I know, bummer.

01:15:37.998 --> 01:15:39.598
We'll get the next one.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.732
[voicemail]
End of voicemail.

To replay this message press...

01:15:42.837 --> 01:15:45.170
[man] Hey kiddo, bad news.

01:15:45.172 --> 01:15:49.342
The studio called and it looks like decided
to go with Tatiana Mislani instead.

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:52.844
Oh, she's gonna be so
amazing in this role.

01:15:52.846 --> 01:15:55.748
I know, this is really
disappointing but

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.849
we just weren't able
to close the deal.

01:15:57.851 --> 01:16:04.259
[cheerful operatic music]

01:16:18.672 --> 01:16:20.309
Well, that sucks for Dani.

01:16:23.411 --> 01:16:25.143
- [Ricky] Yeah!
- [group laughing]

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:29.050
[Grace] Cottage weekend.
Oh, yeah.

01:16:30.685 --> 01:16:34.053
You know guys, besides
a few minor hiccups,

01:16:34.055 --> 01:16:36.057
this was a pretty great
vacation.

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:39.191
We needed this.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:42.230
I am so glad I got to spend
more time with you guys.

01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:47.266
[clearing throat]

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:48.800
Guys.

01:16:48.802 --> 01:16:50.436
I have something to say.

01:16:50.438 --> 01:16:53.238
I remember when Dani
was freaking out at us,

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.977
she said all that stuff about me just
wanting to be famous all the time.

01:16:58.979 --> 01:17:00.845
She was kind of right.

01:17:00.847 --> 01:17:02.947
- Yeah, you are pretty obsessed with social.
- Right?

01:17:02.949 --> 01:17:07.452
Like, uh, what does it matter
how many followers you have?

01:17:07.454 --> 01:17:10.321
It should be the effort that
you put into your craft.

01:17:10.323 --> 01:17:13.291
That's what really matters.

01:17:13.293 --> 01:17:16.961
I was missing that.

01:17:16.963 --> 01:17:19.298
Speaking of that,

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.835
Dani was right about me, too.

01:17:22.837 --> 01:17:25.838
I spend too much time
preparing for auditions

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.940
when I should really
be in the moment.

01:17:27.942 --> 01:17:31.177
I try too hard
and I prepare too much,

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:35.246
and I need to realize
that acting is sometimes

01:17:35.248 --> 01:17:40.820
experiencing emotions
as they're happening.

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:42.787
When I get back,

01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:44.259
I'm gonna take an improv class.

01:17:46.394 --> 01:17:48.393
- [clapping]
- [Ricky] Yeah.

01:17:48.395 --> 01:17:49.861
Grace.

01:17:49.863 --> 01:17:53.098
That is such a good idea.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.300
You know,
I've also realized that,

01:17:55.302 --> 01:18:00.473
[scoffs] I don't need to be so
afraid to express how I'm feeling.

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:02.974
I also don't need
to be afraid about coming out.

01:18:02.976 --> 01:18:04.977
I'm just gonna be myself,

01:18:04.979 --> 01:18:08.446
and if somebody
doesn't like it, who cares?

01:18:08.448 --> 01:18:10.382
It was just holding me back.

01:18:10.384 --> 01:18:14.986
I am gonna be the first
out and proud action star.

01:18:14.988 --> 01:18:17.289
- [laughs]
- Yes!

01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:20.395
Oh, you are
an inspiration to all of us.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.137
And, I guess maybe
I could worry less about

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:33.238
what other people
think or whatever.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.375
There it is. Nice.

01:18:36.377 --> 01:18:41.312
Guys, I think Dani's
death really shed some light

01:18:41.314 --> 01:18:43.449
on some of the greater
internal issues

01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:45.753
that we were all having
with ourselves.

01:18:47.555 --> 01:18:50.121
This is the best thing
that's happened to us,

01:18:50.123 --> 01:18:51.158
individually.

01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:55.928
To Dani?

01:18:55.930 --> 01:18:57.733
[all] To Dani.

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:04.969
Mm.

01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:06.205
Yes.

01:19:06.207 --> 01:19:08.840
[Stefano] Good work.

01:19:08.842 --> 01:19:12.410
So, I think it's time
to call the cops.

01:19:12.412 --> 01:19:13.912
- [Ricky] Yeah.
- [Valerie] Yes.

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:17.116
We need to sound
really upset and panicked.

01:19:17.118 --> 01:19:19.518
Our best friend just died.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.354
- Yeah, yeah.
- Guys.

01:19:23.356 --> 01:19:25.357
This is our moment.

01:19:25.359 --> 01:19:29.197
- [dramatic music]
- [giggling]

01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:36.905
Valerie LeMay for 911 call.

01:19:41.975 --> 01:19:45.009
I just found my friend.
She isn't breathing.

01:19:45.011 --> 01:19:48.546
I think,
I think she might be dead.

01:19:48.548 --> 01:19:50.549
I don't know. Please.

01:19:50.551 --> 01:19:53.251
Please,
you have to send someone.

01:19:53.253 --> 01:19:55.689
[sobbing]

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.094
[soft operatic music]

01:20:03.096 --> 01:20:05.196
Yo, it's my girlfriend!

01:20:05.198 --> 01:20:08.467
She's, I need an ambulance
or something, help me.

01:20:08.469 --> 01:20:11.239
She's drowned or she's dead.
She's not moving!

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:16.174
Hello, my name is Stefano Torres

01:20:16.176 --> 01:20:18.343
and I'd like
to request an ambulance.

01:20:18.345 --> 01:20:21.146
[Ricky] Bro, why are you
doing it all calm like that?

01:20:21.148 --> 01:20:23.348
I'm just playing it
like it hasn't hit me yet.

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:25.084
Like I'm in shock.

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:28.888
[Ricky] Oh, that's, like,
another level deep, bro.

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:31.456
Yeah, man.

01:20:31.458 --> 01:20:33.325
Can I do one, right?

01:20:33.327 --> 01:20:36.064
[slow operatic music]

01:20:43.237 --> 01:20:47.973
Somebody help me,
I need [mumbles].

01:20:47.975 --> 01:20:50.942
[sobbing]

01:20:50.944 --> 01:20:54.882
[slow operatic music]

01:20:58.252 --> 01:21:02.655
[Valerie] We noticed Dani
was missing late last night.

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:07.192
[Ricky] She went for
a hike around five yesterday.

01:21:07.194 --> 01:21:13.031
She was trying to get in shape for
the role that she thought she had.

01:21:13.033 --> 01:21:16.036
[soft music]

01:21:17.704 --> 01:21:20.606
[Grace] Dani's phone went off
and it was her agent.

01:21:20.608 --> 01:21:23.211
We didn't answer it because
Dani was out for her hike.

01:21:25.613 --> 01:21:27.446
And when she wasn't
there the next morning,

01:21:27.448 --> 01:21:30.648
we listened to it to see
if she had left or something.

01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:33.988
[soft orchestral music]

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:44.396
[Stefano]
That's when we noticed a body

01:21:44.398 --> 01:21:45.533
had been washed up on shore.

01:21:48.735 --> 01:21:50.471
We immediately ran over to it

01:21:53.606 --> 01:21:56.577
and we noticed it was Dani.

01:21:58.345 --> 01:22:03.517
[soft orchestral music]

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.606
[ambulance sirens wailing]

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.013
[sobbing]

01:22:35.015 --> 01:22:37.249
[Grace] But we knew
it was useless.

01:22:37.251 --> 01:22:41.623
Dani was gone.
[sobbing]

01:22:44.425 --> 01:22:47.291
She could have been
intoxicated.

01:22:47.293 --> 01:22:50.396
Maybe?

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:53.268
She was drinking all weekend.

01:22:54.335 --> 01:22:57.669
And also,

01:22:57.671 --> 01:23:00.272
she can't swim.

01:23:00.274 --> 01:23:05.277
I just found that out this weekend.
She can't swim. [sobbing]

01:23:05.279 --> 01:23:08.183
She was such a good person.

01:23:11.719 --> 01:23:13.288
She didn't deserve this.

01:23:15.689 --> 01:23:17.459
It doesn't seem real.

01:23:22.195 --> 01:23:24.099
I didn't even hear her
yell for help.

01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:31.672
I'm just so sad the world will never
get to see what a talent she was.

01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:34.742
I'm sorry.

01:23:41.481 --> 01:23:42.680
Okay.

01:23:42.682 --> 01:23:45.284
I can't believe this.

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:47.288
I'm in shock,
I'm honestly in shock.

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:52.027
I'm just trying to be
strong for my friends.

01:23:56.697 --> 01:23:58.132
I was right here.

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:05.137
I was just right here and I had no
idea what was happening to poor Dani.

01:24:05.139 --> 01:24:06.740
I wish it was me.

01:24:11.545 --> 01:24:12.579
Dani.

01:24:16.182 --> 01:24:19.319
Dani Nichols
was my best friend.

01:24:21.255 --> 01:24:22.657
My best friend.

01:24:23.724 --> 01:24:26.391
[sniffling]

01:24:26.393 --> 01:24:29.430
Dani Nichols
was my best friend.

01:24:38.238 --> 01:24:40.571
Hello, good morning.

01:24:40.573 --> 01:24:41.874
Thank you so much
for having me in.

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:44.143
I'm so excited to be here.

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:47.646
Even auditioning for this film is
like a dream, really. [chuckles]

01:24:47.648 --> 01:24:49.815
Sorry, I'm just really excited.

01:24:49.817 --> 01:24:52.284
[casting director]
Well, thanks for coming in.

01:24:52.286 --> 01:24:53.885
Um, Dani Nichols?

01:24:53.887 --> 01:24:55.754
Yep, that's me.

01:24:55.756 --> 01:24:58.790
[casting director] Great.
Okay, whenever you're ready.

01:24:58.792 --> 01:25:02.693
Okay, um, do I just
look into the camera here?

01:25:02.695 --> 01:25:04.698
Okay.
