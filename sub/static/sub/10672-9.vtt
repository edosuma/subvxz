Runnin' strong today, OP!

00:06.040 --> 00:07.644
Starting to feel a little better, huh?

00:07.668 --> 00:11.172
I have felt my strength returning
in recent weeks, Sideswipe.

00:11.378 --> 00:14.079
But that is not
the reason for my urgency.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.782
Windblade, are there any new readings?

00:16.955 --> 00:19.617
Initial reports are confirmed, Optimus.

00:19.620 --> 00:23.666
The security shield protecting one of
my hidden supply caches has been engaged.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.608
But I can't tell
if there's been a breach.

Apart from the broken gate,

00:54.722 --> 00:57.770
I do not detect any obvious
signs of activity.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.604
Proceed cautiously, Stealth Team.

01:00.695 --> 01:01.740
That way.

01:05.656 --> 01:08.466
Master Drift, Jetstorm was wondering...

01:08.468 --> 01:10.069
We were wondering!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.905
We were wondering, respectfully,

01:12.906 --> 01:15.206
if you felt we have progressed
enough in our studies

01:15.209 --> 01:18.236
to perhaps begin making tactical
decisions for ourselves?

01:18.260 --> 01:20.331
We have fought many Decepticons.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.875
We feel we are ready.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.612
Yeah, Drift! The little guys
can't spend their whole lives

01:24.638 --> 01:26.003
at the end of your leash!

01:26.253 --> 01:29.510
My students will complete
their training when I decide.

01:29.799 --> 01:33.865
And when I make that decision,
I will not require assistance.

01:35.995 --> 01:39.736
Don't worry, guys, you're
breaking him down, I can feel it.

Excellent!

01:45.772 --> 01:48.989
Moving to Stage 2
of Operation: Break-In.

01:49.014 --> 01:51.573
Perhaps they'll succeed
where we could not,

01:51.597 --> 01:55.167
and then we'll claim
our spoils and destroy them!

been compromised over the years?

WINDBLADE: No. None.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.293
I've stashed weapons
and supplies all over.

Whatever security you put up doesn't
look like it's still here, Windy.

Look at the wall out of

Tricky.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.935
Light-benders in there
keep the force field

03:13.960 --> 03:16.537
and the controls
almost completely hidden.

03:16.788 --> 03:18.509
The field should be dark blue.

It's taken light damage,
but it hasn't been breached.

03:33.801 --> 03:36.021
OPTIMUS: An impressive collection.

03:36.645 --> 03:38.643
This is one of my larger stashes.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.557
Nothing appears to be missing.

03:45.881 --> 03:48.131
DRIFT: Is it safe to leave
your supplies here?

03:48.156 --> 03:51.491
Should be. But I want to repair
the force field before we go.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.002
And we should see if anything in there
might be of use to us when we...

- Can Bumblebee's team provide assistance?
- Negative, Optimus.

Bumblebee and his team are on a mission
and interference at their location

09:35.107 --> 09:37.207
makes it impossible
for me to contact them.

11:23.895 --> 11:26.743

predicament are our fault.

Because he saved you
and took a hit? Knock it off.

11:29.393 --> 11:32.048
No, because he ordered us
to un-deploy onto him,

11:32.073 --> 11:34.236

11:34.904 --> 11:38.106

perhaps he would not be hurt.

brought shame upon him.

13:32.309 --> 13:36.023
( all grunting )

13:43.308 --> 13:47.104
Base to field team! Why haven't
you brought me that 'Bot yet?

13:47.129 --> 13:50.052
Respond. Respond!

13:50.754 --> 13:52.379
Slick wouldn't let us down.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.510
Field team, respond!

13:55.735 --> 13:58.201
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

14:02.480 --> 14:04.557
Respond!

14:04.761 --> 14:07.489
( soldier grunting )
( computer beeping )

14:08.293 --> 14:10.351
I knew it was a bluff.

14:10.698 --> 14:12.815
Open fire!

14:18.336 --> 14:19.826
( grunting )

14:23.827 --> 14:26.163
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

14:26.164 --> 14:28.284
( soldiers stop grunting )

14:32.049 --> 14:33.553
Hey, Optimus, Windy,

14:33.635 --> 14:34.880
room service?

14:34.980 --> 14:37.668
( clanging )

14:39.032 --> 14:40.174
What's the plan?

14:44.028 --> 14:48.404
We could not disable the door's
magnetic field lock from inside.

14:48.668 --> 14:51.139
We're attempting to force it open.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.490
WINDBLADE: <i>A little help
would be appreciated, Slick.</i>

14:53.491 --> 14:54.758
( slashing )

14:54.783 --> 14:56.493
Your wish is my command.

14:57.065 --> 14:59.328
( grunting )

15:06.000 --> 15:07.738
( soldiers grunting )

15:11.142 --> 15:13.509
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

15:19.056 --> 15:21.469
The field is down! Advance!

15:22.221 --> 15:23.432
( both grunt )

15:23.678 --> 15:27.224
Your minions will no longer
threaten our Master, Stockade.

15:27.249 --> 15:29.676
They are nothing!
Go through them!

15:29.695 --> 15:31.727
( soldiers grunting )

15:51.822 --> 15:52.995
BOTH ( in unison ): Master!

15:53.284 --> 15:55.284
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

15:58.188 --> 16:01.625
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

16:01.626 --> 16:04.327
( all grunting )

16:11.817 --> 16:13.202
Master Drift.

16:14.471 --> 16:16.572
( bomb beeping )

16:19.311 --> 16:21.111
Many thanks, Master.

16:25.015 --> 16:28.384
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

16:31.822 --> 16:34.076
( Sideswipe grunting )

16:36.745 --> 16:40.169
Good work, Sideswipe.
Now stand clear.

16:41.197 --> 16:43.672
( grunting )

16:47.171 --> 16:51.008
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

16:51.009 --> 16:53.317
Someone's definitely feeling better.

16:53.342 --> 16:55.787
Come. The others need us.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.453
( groaning )
( clicking )

17:16.195 --> 17:19.720
Fight, you goldbricks!
I trained you better than this!

17:19.743 --> 17:25.018
It's only one wounded Autobot
and two juvenile Mini-Cons!

17:25.041 --> 17:27.844
OPTIMUS: Not "only" them, Stockade.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.846
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

17:30.848 --> 17:35.959
Unh. Prepare to be defeated
by your better, Optimus Prime.

17:35.983 --> 17:40.072
Prepare to be deeply
disappointed, Stockade.

17:42.179 --> 17:44.329
( both grunting )

18:00.260 --> 18:01.077
( grunts )

18:01.103 --> 18:04.037
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

18:04.281 --> 18:05.124
( yells )

18:10.824 --> 18:13.561
( both grunting )

18:23.978 --> 18:24.871
( gulps )

18:45.506 --> 18:46.315
Huh?

18:49.626 --> 18:52.058
You've got to teach me those moves.

18:55.465 --> 18:58.690
( all grunting )

19:05.571 --> 19:07.977
A temporary defeat...

19:07.979 --> 19:10.998
I shall return...

19:11.165 --> 19:12.357
( groans )

19:12.856 --> 19:15.353
Not any time soon.

19:16.678 --> 19:17.761
BOTH ( in unison ): Master!

19:20.513 --> 19:22.559
Hey, Drift... Ow!

19:22.585 --> 19:24.317
Three times in one day?

19:24.343 --> 19:26.053
Excuse me, Sideswipe.

19:26.077 --> 19:29.173
I mistook you for another
unintelligent enemy.

19:29.471 --> 19:30.798
BOTH ( in unison ): Master Drift.

19:30.987 --> 19:33.882
I am well, Slipstream, Jetstorm.

19:33.906 --> 19:39.371
- We will assist you.
- No. You performed... admirably today...

19:39.395 --> 19:41.023
without my guidance.

19:41.145 --> 19:43.271
Your education is complete.

19:43.615 --> 19:46.309
You are no longer my students.

19:46.592 --> 19:49.551
- Yes!
- But, Master Drift,

19:49.554 --> 19:51.554
we do not wish to be on our own.

19:51.556 --> 19:53.647
We wish to remain under your tutelage.

19:53.673 --> 19:54.538
What?

19:54.563 --> 19:57.372
Now that we have begun
deploying from other Autobots,

19:57.496 --> 20:00.665
surely there are many new combat
techniques you can teach us.

20:00.691 --> 20:03.660
Yes, 1035 of them.

20:03.684 --> 20:07.487
Also, we ignored your earlier
call to join with you

20:07.511 --> 20:09.307
so we could fight on our own.

20:09.919 --> 20:12.463
Clearly, we have not mastered respect.

20:12.943 --> 20:15.292
Please, may we stay with you?

20:16.021 --> 20:17.346
You may.

20:17.348 --> 20:19.883
But this trend
of disrespect concerns me.

20:19.907 --> 20:21.657
And it will not be tolerated.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.086
BOTH ( in unison ): Yes, teacher.

20:23.368 --> 20:25.596
I will never understand them.

20:27.256 --> 20:29.484
Anybody here need punchin'?

20:29.803 --> 20:31.124
Grimlock!

20:31.148 --> 20:32.567
We got back from our mission,

20:32.593 --> 20:35.890
and Fixit said we really needed
to get the GroundBridge working

20:35.914 --> 20:38.616
- 'cause you were in trouble.
- He was correct.

20:38.823 --> 20:43.497
We have captives and supplies that
would best be stored in the Scrapyard.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.914
And our master is in need of repairs.

20:46.130 --> 20:48.238
GRIMLOCK: Then let's
start with you, Drift.

20:48.583 --> 20:52.395
DRIFT: Unh, no! Put me... Unh, I can...

20:52.717 --> 20:55.117
Ah. How disrespectful...

20:55.119 --> 20:58.887
(<i> soft theme playing )</i>

20:58.890 --> 21:03.561
Autobots, the time has come to go home.
