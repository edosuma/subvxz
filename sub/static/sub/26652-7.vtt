It's the only word

02:12.480 --> 02:14.351
That thing is an ancient
magical artifact.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.179
- Yeah, but it keeps him happy.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.399

02:18.442 --> 02:20.183
You can't let Rory
keep the diary.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.362

- Interesting.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.288
I had Gideon stimulate
my hair follicles

02:38.332 --> 02:39.246

02:39.289 --> 02:41.596
I read in one of Nora's letters

02:41.639 --> 02:43.641

02:43.685 --> 02:45.774

we all being so blasé

02:45.817 --> 02:47.297

02:47.341 --> 02:49.952
What if Rory goes from writing
sci

02:49.995 --> 02:51.780
Do you want killer clowns
running around the ship?

02:51.823 --> 02:53.085

serial killer

03:05.881 --> 03:06.925
in the United States?

03:06.969 --> 03:08.318
- Ted Bundy.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.493
Although in my opinion
John Wayne Gacy

03:09.537 --> 03:11.887
had way more victims

this not-so-kid-friendly
cereal,

03:20.678 --> 03:24.726
is answer is New Orleans' own
Marie Laveau.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.035
A high-profile

03:30.079 --> 03:31.080
No, I would have heard of her.

It appears a Fugitive

03:38.479 --> 03:40.394

03:44.267 --> 03:45.442
