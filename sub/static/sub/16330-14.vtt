00:36.296 --> 00:37.932
Are you seeing this? There's a boot logger.

00:37.956 --> 00:38.874
They're gonna know we were here.

00:38.944 --> 00:41.021
That's why I'm changing the
grades on the backup server.

00:41.045 --> 00:41.833
And that helps us how?

00:41.897 --> 00:43.129
Once I zero out the local drives,

00:43.153 --> 00:45.744
they'll have no choice but to
restore them from the backups.

00:45.824 --> 00:47.326
Yada, yada, yada, new grades in place.

00:47.350 --> 00:49.626
No sign we were here. You're welcome. Psh.

00:49.661 --> 00:50.463
The cops are here!

00:50.498 --> 00:52.627
Like, not the campus cops, the real cops!

00:52.701 --> 00:55.144
Oh, God... they've entered the building.

00:55.179 --> 00:57.710
We have to go. Now!

00:57.769 --> 00:59.529
- Just give me a minute.
- We don't have one.

01:00.834 --> 01:02.190
Let's go, guys, come on.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.806
Agh!

01:09.144 --> 01:11.104
Uhh! I did not enjoy that!

01:11.164 --> 01:13.118
The cops saw us. What
if they can I.D. us, man?

01:13.206 --> 01:14.332
This is so, so bad.

01:14.406 --> 01:16.221
Actually, this is very, very good.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.102
See, now we know the
true police response time,

01:18.126 --> 01:20.256
so if we account for that here

01:20.373 --> 01:23.910
and adjust the other
variables accordingly, booyah.

01:23.957 --> 01:26.995
- Next time, we'll...
- Next time, we'll study!

01:27.054 --> 01:28.054
Oh, God.

01:32.142 --> 01:35.014
Well, you did it. Officers, you caught us.

01:35.077 --> 01:38.200
A bunch of dumb college kids
just trespassing on campus

01:38.270 --> 01:40.779
as dumb college kids are wont to do.

01:40.857 --> 01:42.910
Now, you could take us down
to the station, I get that.

01:42.934 --> 01:45.637
Fill out all that boring
paperwork, but for what?

01:45.689 --> 01:48.157
I mean, it's a silly misdemeanor.

01:48.243 --> 01:50.603
So why don't we just chalk this
up we just being out here...

01:50.633 --> 01:52.690
Agh!

01:52.776 --> 01:54.507
Uhh! Ohh.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.697
_

02:22.159 --> 02:24.120
You look tired.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.620
You need a
pick-me-up?

02:27.040 --> 02:29.074
Beats the hell out of espresso.

02:31.503 --> 02:34.046
It was fun pretending to be
somebody else for the weekend,

02:34.114 --> 02:37.385
but I'm... on the clock now.

02:38.154 --> 02:40.917
Dr. Jekyll and Agent Reade.

02:49.619 --> 02:51.244
Nikki, I gotta get ready.

02:51.303 --> 02:52.884
You feel ready to me.

02:56.948 --> 02:59.373
Shepherd looked me right in the eye.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.464
Just before...

03:04.892 --> 03:06.478
There was nothing you could do.

03:06.556 --> 03:07.918
That's the problem!

03:07.953 --> 03:10.482
I mean, Shepherd goes where she wants.

03:10.550 --> 03:11.717
Does what she wants.

03:11.786 --> 03:13.640
Kills who she wants!

03:13.968 --> 03:15.356
There's nothing that we can ever do.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.580
Well, not entirely.

03:16.615 --> 03:18.190
She didn't count on us finding Clark.

03:18.234 --> 03:20.250
She killed him because he knew something.

03:21.047 --> 03:23.567
Clark was lucid for a second.

03:24.091 --> 03:26.397
He mentioned something
about "The Truman Protocol."

03:26.432 --> 03:28.443
Does that mean anything to you?

03:28.478 --> 03:30.783
No... but, look, I'll look into it.

03:31.163 --> 03:33.280
Uh, in the meantime...

03:34.162 --> 03:35.721
Property records.

03:35.756 --> 03:37.665
For Ellen Briggs.

03:37.733 --> 03:40.451
This is everywhere that Shepherd
lived before she went off the grid?

03:40.514 --> 03:42.732
Meaning Roman and I might
have lived there, too.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.766
We need to send you and Roman
to every one of these addresses.

03:45.845 --> 03:48.906
See if any of them trigger
anything that leads us to Shepherd.

03:48.941 --> 03:51.805
Hey, sorry to interrupt. There's
something you need to see.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.139
What are you doing back here already?

03:56.488 --> 03:58.523
I'm okay... I saw a doctor,

03:58.558 --> 04:00.531
and she said there's nothing
physically wrong with me.

04:00.555 --> 04:02.788
All the more reason to get
checked out psychologically.

04:02.823 --> 04:05.058
An okay person doesn't collapse at work.

04:05.129 --> 04:07.754
I had to come in today. For a tattoo.

04:07.822 --> 04:08.829
You solved a new one?

04:08.864 --> 04:11.365
Actually, this one solved itself.

04:13.154 --> 04:16.212
By design, this tattoo
had to be solved today.

04:16.247 --> 04:17.346
How is that possible?

04:17.382 --> 04:19.584
There's an equation hidden in the tattoo.

04:19.647 --> 04:22.209
Its variables correspond to
real-world economic values...

04:22.270 --> 04:24.223
stock prices, commodities, futures.

04:24.288 --> 04:27.544
This morning, for the first
time, the equation balanced out.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.603
- So something is about to go down.
- But what?

04:29.638 --> 04:32.613
I'm not sure yet, but I'm
pretty sure it involves lithium.

04:32.676 --> 04:34.024
In order for this equation to work,

04:34.048 --> 04:36.214
its market price had to
pass an all-time high.

04:36.284 --> 04:37.836
What's so special about lithium?

04:37.899 --> 04:40.497
It's the main component in all
modern high-capacity batteries.

04:40.532 --> 04:43.001
Everything from smart
phones to electric cars.

04:43.084 --> 04:44.850
Lithium powers the things
that power everything.

04:44.874 --> 04:46.537
It's quickly becoming the new oil.

04:46.592 --> 04:48.889
But what about the tattoo itself?

04:48.986 --> 04:53.249
It's the seal for a secret society
at Jameson College called Daedalus.

04:53.284 --> 04:54.944
The smart guy from Greek mythology.

04:55.012 --> 04:57.213
Made Icarus's wings, right?

04:58.645 --> 05:00.765
Stop looking at me like
that when I know things.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.806
Pretentious college kids and lithium.

05:02.892 --> 05:03.918
That does not add up.

05:03.953 --> 05:05.993
Maybe they're mixing it
with Jaeger and doing shots?

05:06.036 --> 05:10.050
All right, how secret
is this secret society?

05:10.103 --> 05:13.412
Very... members have a
strict code of silence,

05:13.467 --> 05:17.200
but a partial list of alumni
was leaked a few years back.

05:17.268 --> 05:19.261
Wow, that's some pretty heavy hitters here.

05:19.340 --> 05:22.085
Fortune 500 CEOs, a couple of senators.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.515
Even a former chairman
of the Federal Reserve.

05:24.581 --> 05:25.602
No...

05:26.877 --> 05:27.964
And Gord Enver.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.566
Yeah, I thought you might like that one.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.114
Why does that sound familiar to me?

05:31.182 --> 05:33.297
Because it's Rich.com's real name.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.580
Please tell me we don't
need to bring him in.

05:35.642 --> 05:37.799
We need a member who will talk.

05:37.866 --> 05:41.625
And no one likes talking more than Rich.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.405
What the hell?

05:47.440 --> 05:49.329
Looks like someone found religion.

05:49.418 --> 05:51.818
Looks like someone found all the religions.

05:51.871 --> 05:54.936
Children, let us pray.

05:55.941 --> 05:57.721
You've got to be kidding me.

06:10.050 --> 06:11.859
Bless this mess.

06:11.894 --> 06:13.323
You done?

06:13.422 --> 06:14.990
We need to ask you for a little help.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.198
Say no more.

06:17.612 --> 06:18.753
With a case.

06:18.831 --> 06:19.666
I'd love to help you,

06:19.746 --> 06:21.497
but, uh, I'm actually pretty busy

06:21.532 --> 06:23.537
trying to investigate the spiritual plane

06:23.603 --> 06:25.808
and reclaim my tattered
soul from eternal damnation.

06:25.871 --> 06:28.039
We have some questions about Daedalus.

06:29.328 --> 06:30.938
True answers come from within, Jane.

06:30.982 --> 06:34.772
Cooperate... and we can make your
incarceration far more comfortable.

06:34.807 --> 06:37.337
What can you offer the
man who wants for nothing?

06:37.879 --> 06:39.557
The rest of your time in prison

06:39.623 --> 06:42.515
becoming a living hell
if you don't cooperate.

06:42.550 --> 06:43.887
Every home is a prison.

06:43.922 --> 06:45.201
Every prison a home.

06:45.236 --> 06:48.139
I have no home, ergo, I have no prison.

06:48.202 --> 06:50.145
So your religion is Fortune Cookie.

06:50.199 --> 06:53.349
It's easier to hide behind
simple jokes... I get it.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.886
Just tell us what this is.

06:57.512 --> 06:58.922
How'd you get this?

07:01.431 --> 07:03.764
What is the formula doing on your body?

07:03.799 --> 07:05.912
What do you mean? What's "the formula"?

07:08.414 --> 07:11.272
Okay, off the record, it's
an old Daedalus tradition.

07:11.340 --> 07:13.495
It's a risk-reward algorithm we use

07:13.550 --> 07:17.084
to determine which risky activity
is actually worth the risk.

07:17.142 --> 07:19.529
Cheating on tests, shoplifting...

07:19.602 --> 07:21.503
unprotected sex... you know, the fun stuff.

07:21.555 --> 07:23.316
But some alumni have actually taken

07:23.351 --> 07:25.185
to using it in their post-college lives

07:25.264 --> 07:27.856
to justify some pretty
shady business dealings.

07:27.891 --> 07:30.092
Like becoming a dark web kingpin.

07:30.298 --> 07:31.465
Let he who is without sin...

07:31.523 --> 07:33.469
Please focus, Rich.

07:35.078 --> 07:37.046
This version of the formula...

07:37.526 --> 07:38.760
what's it for?

07:40.840 --> 07:42.648
Oh, <i>Gott im Himmel.</i>

07:42.725 --> 07:44.738
This is bad. This is very bad.

07:44.799 --> 07:46.408
What's bad, Rich?

07:46.443 --> 07:48.490
Koran Surah 5:101.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.892
"Do not ask about things
which, if they are shown you,

07:50.957 --> 07:51.920
will distress you."

07:51.955 --> 07:53.577
I'm already distressed!

07:53.612 --> 07:54.872
What does it mean?

07:57.279 --> 07:59.046
Matthew 24:7.

07:59.218 --> 08:01.226
And nation will rise against nation,

08:01.302 --> 08:02.902
kingdom against kingdom.

08:03.594 --> 08:06.514
This permutation of the formula
determines the optimal time

08:06.549 --> 08:08.012
to start an armed conflict.

08:08.062 --> 08:09.529
And, according to these numbers,

08:09.616 --> 08:11.560
that time is today.

08:12.442 --> 08:14.430
What are you saying, Rich?

08:14.484 --> 08:16.600
Call your family and
tell them you love them.

08:18.276 --> 08:20.905
Because this is a formula to start a war.

08:26.810 --> 08:31.810
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

08:36.802 --> 08:38.075
Basically, Rich is right.

08:38.110 --> 08:40.311
There's nothing basic
about it... I'm right.

08:40.381 --> 08:42.485
The formula's been tweaked
to determine at what point

08:42.520 --> 08:43.971
lithium becomes so expensive

08:44.018 --> 08:46.652
that it's more cost
effective to just, you know,

08:46.687 --> 08:48.222
invade another country and take theirs.

08:48.246 --> 08:50.785
- Which country?
- Hard to say, based on the data set.

08:50.851 --> 08:52.786
All major conflicts begin with a catalyst,

08:52.851 --> 08:54.803
<i>a casus belli,</i> if you will.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.590
Anyone can start a war if
they find the right spark.

08:56.614 --> 08:58.000
And blame it on the right country.

08:58.035 --> 08:59.702
See? She gets it. All you need to do

08:59.737 --> 09:01.581
is force the government's hand
with a large enough attack.

09:01.605 --> 09:04.125
So what's the attack, and which
country's getting framed for it?

09:04.160 --> 09:07.022
And which members of Daedalus
are involved in the conspiracy?

09:07.057 --> 09:08.838
How should I know? I belong to a...

09:08.873 --> 09:09.959
very different club now.

09:10.009 --> 09:12.171
Okay, so you're gonna pontificate?

09:12.221 --> 09:15.523
Start waxing poetic on who else
we should look at in Daedalus.

09:18.612 --> 09:21.187
Zach Riley. He's gotta be involved.

09:21.254 --> 09:22.404
You know Zach Riley?

09:22.467 --> 09:24.967
Know him? He got me into Daedalus.

09:25.002 --> 09:26.865
The guy who wants to colonize the moon?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.935
Oh, he's more than just the moon guy.

09:28.995 --> 09:31.233
His software, RileyShare,
was practically the birth

09:31.288 --> 09:34.418
of digital music distribution.
Sold it for billions.

09:34.453 --> 09:36.133
Now he's a major player in everything from

09:36.205 --> 09:38.288
artificial intelligence to electric cars.

09:38.323 --> 09:39.931
He's also a major ass-hat, okay?

09:39.974 --> 09:43.504
It's like me, but without the wit or
the looks or the char... You know what?

09:43.571 --> 09:44.973
It's not a good comparison, okay?

09:45.068 --> 09:46.620
- Imagine...
- Oh, my God.

09:46.655 --> 09:48.548
Electric cars are powered by lithium.

09:49.405 --> 09:51.717
There... Riley Motors

09:51.752 --> 09:54.585
is one of the biggest buyers
of lithium in the hemisphere.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.279
So if the U.S. invade the right country,

09:56.313 --> 09:58.470
they could save him billions.

09:58.505 --> 10:01.101
I want to know where
Zach Riley is, right now.

10:02.175 --> 10:04.458
Anyone else in Daedalus
that we should know about?

10:04.942 --> 10:08.130
Well, there's probably
one guy I should mention.

10:11.516 --> 10:13.156
No.
N-N-N-N-No.

10:13.191 --> 10:14.889
You didn't tell me he would be here.

10:14.944 --> 10:18.229
I... if this is another one of your
schemes to get me back, I swear...

10:18.264 --> 10:19.487
I had nothing to do with this.

10:19.522 --> 10:21.355
You like nice, by the way.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.375
Don't talk to me, don't look at me...

10:23.415 --> 10:25.323
Don't look at you? Come on, look at me!

10:25.358 --> 10:27.033
I'm a changed man because of you.

10:27.088 --> 10:28.870
You made me wanna be a better human.

10:28.935 --> 10:31.519
Okay, so... uck! You again?

10:31.585 --> 10:33.053
Lovely to see you as well.

10:34.766 --> 10:37.090
All right, guess where
Zach Riley is right now.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.485
Back at Jameson College,

10:38.520 --> 10:40.857
an honoree for the winter carnival.

10:40.892 --> 10:42.565
That makes sense...
Daedalus will traditionally

10:42.589 --> 10:45.388
hide their meetings under the
cover of larger alumni events.

10:45.423 --> 10:48.383
It's, uh, designed to help
safeguard their secrecy.

10:48.424 --> 10:49.875
At some point during the carnival,

10:49.938 --> 10:52.191
they'll have a members-only
cocktail party at The Labyrinth.

10:52.215 --> 10:53.546
The what?

10:53.741 --> 10:55.491
Daedalus's clubhouse on campus.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.985
Well, we need to get in that building.

10:57.009 --> 10:59.885
Find out who Riley's conspiring with
and when the attack's gonna happen.

10:59.953 --> 11:02.404
Good luck... groups a lot
scarier than the F.B.I.

11:02.439 --> 11:04.439
have tried that and failed miserably.

11:04.474 --> 11:07.239
Why go in as F.B.I. when we got two
card-carrying members right here?

11:07.274 --> 11:09.129
- That's a good point.
- Me go with Rich?

11:09.164 --> 11:10.844
Uh, no, just give me the death penalty.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.875
Oh, my God, how many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

11:12.899 --> 11:14.299
Once! You have to say it one time!

11:14.334 --> 11:15.723
Enough, you two!

11:15.758 --> 11:18.495
Can members take a date to this party?

11:18.549 --> 11:20.837
I mean, it's been a while since
I've been available to attend,

11:20.861 --> 11:22.704
- but, uh, yeah, they sure used to.
- Great.

11:22.739 --> 11:24.627
You'll go separately with a plus one.

11:24.670 --> 11:26.903
That way, have twice the
eyes and ears in there.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.944
I'm sorry, but... why
would I help any of you?

11:29.979 --> 11:32.242
'Cause I can transfer you to Victorville.

11:32.310 --> 11:34.576
That's 85 miles from your parents in L.A.

11:34.644 --> 11:37.200
I know it's been a little
hard for them to travel,

11:37.235 --> 11:41.069
so this way, they'll be
able to visit you more often.

11:41.195 --> 11:43.299
- As for you, Rich...
- Tut, tut, tut.

11:43.345 --> 11:45.585
The Talmud states that
whoever saves a life,

11:45.653 --> 11:48.381
it is considered as if
they saved an entire world.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.619
Stopping this war will
save thousands of lives,

11:50.673 --> 11:52.605
and therefore, thousands of worlds.

11:52.652 --> 11:54.473
That's quite enough for me.

11:57.365 --> 11:58.613
It's a war formula.

11:58.648 --> 11:59.839
You need me out there.

11:59.874 --> 12:01.678
No, right now, it's a recon mission.

12:01.735 --> 12:04.140
All right? Our priority is still Sandstorm.

12:04.175 --> 12:07.089
Nas will take you and Roman to
all of Shepherd's old residences.

12:07.124 --> 12:09.132
See if any of them trigger any memories.

12:09.167 --> 12:10.547
Are you sure?

12:10.623 --> 12:12.229
- Stop touching this.
- You're touching it.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.669
I'm allowed to, it's mine.

12:14.219 --> 12:16.906
Yeah... uh... I can handle Rich.

12:16.941 --> 12:18.575
All right? But we need a lead on Shepherd.

12:18.599 --> 12:20.531
So, please, find out.

12:20.605 --> 12:21.662
Yeah, okay.

12:22.686 --> 12:24.240
We have to infiltrate Daedalus,

12:24.288 --> 12:26.260
get a pulse on Riley, and stop this attack.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.150
So, Boston and Rich, they
can get us into The Labyrinth.

12:29.212 --> 12:31.404
Patterson, are you up for some field work?

12:31.512 --> 12:33.081
- Yes.
- Good.

12:33.148 --> 12:34.148
You're with Boston.

12:34.182 --> 12:35.932
Uck, Agent Granny Panties?

12:35.992 --> 12:38.381
Oh, it's not exactly
Comic-Con for me, either, dude.

12:38.416 --> 12:39.366
She knows this world.

12:39.401 --> 12:41.870
And her tech skills could come in handy.

12:41.923 --> 12:44.195
Rich... You take Tasha.

12:44.614 --> 12:46.001
Which one's Tasha?

12:47.996 --> 12:49.096
That one.

12:50.055 --> 12:51.788
No offense, but I don't think

12:51.823 --> 12:55.517
anyone's gonna buy
Suzy-Frowns-A-Lot as my plus one.

12:55.553 --> 12:57.271
And, really, there's only
one person in the whole F.B.I.

12:57.295 --> 12:59.276
that can maybe pass as my date.

12:59.340 --> 13:00.476
Jane's busy.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.695
You're not talking about Jane.

13:22.432 --> 13:24.780
See, this is trust. This is friendship.

13:24.815 --> 13:25.953
Equal footing.

13:28.566 --> 13:29.309
Ahh.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.090
That water taste funny to you?

13:31.562 --> 13:34.075
It's a little isotope that Nas cooked up.

13:34.158 --> 13:35.924
It stays in your body for days,

13:35.960 --> 13:37.433
trackable by satellites.

13:37.502 --> 13:38.894
You leave me for a second,

13:38.958 --> 13:41.537
I'll find you and I'll shoot
you as a fleeing fugitive.

13:41.590 --> 13:43.799
You are so controlling.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.640
Why do I keep coming back to you?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.367
So what happened between you and Rich?

13:50.413 --> 13:53.253
He, uh, got sober in prison and
realized you were the worst person ever?

13:53.318 --> 13:54.761
I don't want to talk about it.

13:54.884 --> 13:57.535
So is there a Mr. Boring
Lab Coat in your life?

13:58.047 --> 13:59.526
I don't wanna talk about it.

14:00.365 --> 14:02.112
<i>All right, we're heading
in. Can you hear us?</i>

14:02.136 --> 14:04.336
All right, Riley went into
The Labyrinth 20 minutes ago.

14:04.363 --> 14:06.336
All right, let's get eyes
on him as fast as we can.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.514
See who he's talking to.

14:07.549 --> 14:10.984
Uh, guys, these don't look
like typical college bouncers.

14:11.019 --> 14:12.790
Only the penitent man shall pass.

14:12.842 --> 14:15.202
All right, well, now you're
just quoting "The Last Crusade."

14:18.696 --> 14:19.798
Mmm!

14:23.001 --> 14:24.001
No!

14:24.518 --> 14:26.350
No, Gord Enver is not welcome here.

14:26.385 --> 14:27.667
Phineas Gilmartin!

14:27.702 --> 14:29.398
How dare you come back
here after what you did?

14:29.422 --> 14:31.552
- Oh...
- Under no conditions

14:31.613 --> 14:33.288
is this man to enter this building.

14:33.323 --> 14:34.782
Phineas, you're not still mad about that?

14:34.806 --> 14:36.866
- Good-bye, Gord.
- Phinny!

14:36.910 --> 14:39.533
To err is human, to forgive is...

14:39.606 --> 14:42.711
Fellas, I'm a member here. It's just
a little inside joke we play sometimes.

14:42.767 --> 14:46.930
Okay, um, well... what if I were to
tell you that he is a, uh, huge racist?

14:46.988 --> 14:49.348
How 'bout that? I'm not just
telling you, by the way, but...

14:50.199 --> 14:53.468
You do realize getting inside that
building is a matter of national security.

14:53.661 --> 14:57.057
- So... what haven't you told me?
- Ow, ow, ow! Jeez!

14:57.092 --> 15:00.326
Okay, I maybe kinda-sorta forgot
to mention that I'm kinda-sorta

15:00.361 --> 15:03.417
<i>persona non grata</i>
around here these days.

15:03.452 --> 15:05.190
Hey, now we can go check out the carnival.

15:05.258 --> 15:06.617
Huh? Maybe take in the ice sculptures?

15:06.641 --> 15:08.739
Riley is about to start a war.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.980
It's a bit hard to stop from out here.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.814
There may be another way. Come on.

15:17.570 --> 15:20.044
People forgot about these
tunnels once Prohibition ended.

15:20.141 --> 15:23.132
But I used to use them to sneak all
kinds of other things into The Labyrinth.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.658
Hookers, Kurt, I'm talking about hookers.

15:24.682 --> 15:27.085
I mean, if you're gonna
push to be uncouth, you know.

15:27.148 --> 15:28.968
Why does Phineas hate you so much?

15:29.003 --> 15:30.003
Apart from the obvious.

15:30.032 --> 15:31.647
Oh, I took apart his BWM

15:31.682 --> 15:33.904
and then reassembled it
on the roof of his dorm.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.387
I don't know why he got so upset.

15:35.445 --> 15:37.223
I'm the one that almost got expelled.

15:37.791 --> 15:39.466
Hey, what gives? No, uh...

15:39.544 --> 15:42.058
judgmental glare? No lecture
on reaping what I sow?

15:42.093 --> 15:43.840
Ah, I nearly got expelled myself.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.378
- A few times.
- What?

15:45.413 --> 15:47.782
Kurt Weller, master prankster.
Is that what you're telling me?

15:47.806 --> 15:49.872
- I want details.
- So do I.

15:50.293 --> 15:52.275
Oh, my God. We're having a
moment right now, aren't we?

15:52.299 --> 15:54.179
- No!
- You're realizing we're not so different.

15:54.218 --> 15:56.034
We're two peas in a pod. Yin and yang.

15:56.097 --> 15:58.625
Isaac and Ishmael.
DeVito and Schwarzenegger.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.318
Can you please just try and stay focused?

16:00.380 --> 16:01.881
- Oh, hey, wait.
- What?

16:02.322 --> 16:05.873
Well, this is the door,
but the handle's different.

16:05.967 --> 16:07.133
How?

16:07.201 --> 16:08.628
Well, it's not there anymore?

16:08.693 --> 16:10.183
Probably on account of all
the hookers I bought up.

16:10.207 --> 16:11.381
I mentioned the hookers, right?

16:11.405 --> 16:12.590
Yes, you did.

16:14.157 --> 16:15.737
So what's behind that door?

16:15.800 --> 16:16.922
The closet.

16:16.957 --> 16:18.670
- All right.
- What...

16:18.732 --> 16:19.360
- Stand back.
- What are you doing?

16:19.395 --> 16:20.395
Okay.

16:25.264 --> 16:28.229
Oh, see what they did? They took out
the closet to make room for the...

16:28.264 --> 16:29.732
Yeah, this is better.

16:30.726 --> 16:32.048
I mean...

16:32.116 --> 16:34.093
not for us right now, obviously.

16:41.050 --> 16:43.714
Well, if it isn't the one and only

16:43.758 --> 16:46.508
Gord Enver, everybody!

16:46.583 --> 16:49.005
I wondered how you might make an entrance.

16:49.101 --> 16:51.341
You did not disappoint.

16:51.405 --> 16:54.042
Guys, please... he's a member.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.931
Well, he was a member, right, before...

16:55.977 --> 16:57.548
You know what? He's with me.

16:57.598 --> 16:58.430
- Thad Munson.
- Yes.

16:58.465 --> 16:59.958
You're a sight for sore eyes.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.192
Ah, it's good to see you, pal.

17:02.242 --> 17:03.377
Oh, stop it.

17:03.412 --> 17:04.853
My, who's your friend?

17:04.902 --> 17:08.171
I would like to introduce
you to Kurt... Enver.

17:08.205 --> 17:09.579
My husband.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.656
Hm.

17:11.691 --> 17:12.865
Nice try.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.240
But this guy's got "hooker"
written all over him.

17:18.036 --> 17:20.296
- His arms are all burly.
- Rrr, rrr!

17:20.351 --> 17:22.938
You mind me asking where you got him?
Because I'd back that stallion, whew.

17:22.962 --> 17:24.872
Oh, he's definitely a prostitute.

17:26.454 --> 17:28.353
Thad, Phineas Gilmartin was
giving me a bit of attitude...

17:28.377 --> 17:30.423
Yeah, you know what, I'll handle Phineas.

17:30.458 --> 17:33.761
You and your, uh, meat
trophy enjoy yourself.

17:37.404 --> 17:42.083
Reade, Tasha... what have we got on
Thad Munson and Phineas Gilmartin?

17:42.151 --> 17:45.203
Phineas is an insurance lobbyist
going through a bad divorce.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.167
And Thad's a Wall Street
guy known as The Vampire.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.684
Buys struggling companies and
sucks out every last penny.

17:49.719 --> 17:51.461
Yeah, he just did it to
a pharmaceutical company.

17:51.485 --> 17:54.646
He raised their cancer
drug prices by over 1,000%.

17:54.681 --> 17:56.144
This guy definitely needs to be locked up,

17:56.168 --> 17:58.181
but probably not for a terrorist attack.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.168
This is where we grew up?

18:06.236 --> 18:07.755
15 Robin Hood Lane.

18:07.817 --> 18:09.900
According to property records,
this is where Shepherd lived

18:09.924 --> 18:11.824
when she brought you
back from South Africa.

18:13.473 --> 18:14.677
Anything?

18:15.742 --> 18:17.795
No. You?

18:17.864 --> 18:18.847
No.

18:18.882 --> 18:20.883
If this is where we were raised...

18:21.189 --> 18:22.565
it should mean something, right?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.223
Well, let's take a look inside.

18:24.288 --> 18:26.804
Well, what if someone comes home?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.597
Or Shepherd could be
expecting us to come here.

18:28.621 --> 18:30.107
It could be a trap.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.879
With you two... I'll take my chances.

18:44.251 --> 18:45.251
Hmm.

18:46.591 --> 18:48.721
Zach Riley, 10:00.

18:48.756 --> 18:50.456
Standing at a table with...

18:51.741 --> 18:53.799
Ah, I can't tell from here.

18:53.940 --> 18:54.986
Ahem!

18:56.033 --> 18:58.105
Shall we? Hmm?

19:01.848 --> 19:02.933
What about now?

19:05.425 --> 19:08.470
Oof! That's Bradford
Winer, international lawyer.

19:09.058 --> 19:10.654
Does a lot of work with
the state department.

19:10.678 --> 19:12.697
If I were trying to seize
resources from a foreign country

19:12.721 --> 19:14.721
I would definitely want him on my side.

19:19.287 --> 19:21.794
Their plan of attack
could be on that computer.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.753
Can you get past his security measures?

19:26.488 --> 19:28.675
Well, technically, I'm
barred by the U.S. government

19:28.710 --> 19:31.245
from operating any illeg... Ohh! Okay.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.167
The local security is not the issue.

19:33.202 --> 19:35.620
The tricky part is the fob in Riley's hand.

19:35.687 --> 19:38.673
It generates a new, eight-digit
pass code every 90 seconds,

19:38.725 --> 19:40.585
and it can't be faked... we need that code.

19:40.648 --> 19:41.685
Patterson, you got that?

19:41.720 --> 19:42.944
We'll handle the key fob.

19:43.017 --> 19:44.151
<i>We'll get the computer.</i>

19:45.544 --> 19:46.744
Come on, honey.

19:55.801 --> 19:57.954
Hard to believe we ever
lived in a place so...

19:57.989 --> 19:59.164
Normal?

20:06.140 --> 20:07.440
You remember something?

20:11.828 --> 20:12.828
No.

20:13.614 --> 20:16.483
I can't even remember
the house I grew up in.

20:16.612 --> 20:19.213
Maybe Shepherd kept us someplace different.

20:19.517 --> 20:21.304
Shepherd took my life away.

20:21.504 --> 20:23.067
- Roman...
- She took everything!

20:23.124 --> 20:25.981
- I know how you feel.
- Then why don't you feel it?!

20:27.666 --> 20:29.451
She did this to you, too!

20:30.270 --> 20:31.682
Where's your anger?

20:32.482 --> 20:33.649
Where's your hurt?!

20:34.712 --> 20:36.654
Roman... hey...

20:36.689 --> 20:38.576
I need you to calm down, okay?

20:39.270 --> 20:40.563
No...

20:40.649 --> 20:42.601
She stole my life from me.

20:42.636 --> 20:44.036
She's gonna pay.

20:50.087 --> 20:51.788
You're in pretty low gear today.

20:54.157 --> 20:55.823
I been dating Nikki.

20:56.739 --> 20:58.760
- Freddy's girlfriend?
- Ex-girlfriend.

20:58.795 --> 21:01.261
Oh, the ex-girlfriend of the
killer you helped skip town?

21:02.135 --> 21:03.513
Do you have any idea how messed up that is?

21:03.537 --> 21:05.850
No, thought never crossed my mind, Zapata.

21:05.971 --> 21:06.879
<i>Reade, Tasha,</i>

21:06.948 --> 21:08.532
<i>Rich and I are headed upstairs.</i>

21:08.633 --> 21:10.879
- <i>You got eyes on the guards?</i>
- Only the ones in front.

21:10.934 --> 21:12.506
<i>Well, we're gonna have to risk it.</i>

21:13.341 --> 21:15.586
How do you know this is where
Riley would keep his laptop?

21:15.610 --> 21:18.286
Trust me, I know more
about Zach than Zach does.

21:18.382 --> 21:19.834
We were best friends back in the day.

21:19.858 --> 21:20.964
Till you pissed him off?

21:20.999 --> 21:24.259
No, until he pissed me off when he took
something that didn't belong to him.

21:24.369 --> 21:25.717
Haven't spoken to him since.

21:28.543 --> 21:29.880
You know, actually,

21:29.915 --> 21:32.449
you could say that he pretty much set
me on the path to becoming Rich.com...

21:32.473 --> 21:34.843
Rich! I don't need the origin story.

21:34.930 --> 21:37.159
Right, nobody likes a prequel.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.320
Zachy boy.

21:44.584 --> 21:46.371
Some people never change.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.214
We're ready for that password.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.985
All right, it should be
displayed on that fob.

21:53.816 --> 21:55.453
Damn, front shirt pocket.

21:55.488 --> 21:56.766
Hardest pocket to pick.

21:56.832 --> 21:57.757
Okay, well, what if...

21:57.801 --> 21:59.157
What if we just spill something on him,

21:59.181 --> 22:01.286
and he has to take the key
fob out to change, right?

22:01.354 --> 22:03.166
Yeah, alone in a bathroom somewhere.

22:03.201 --> 22:04.375
I thought you were the smart one.

22:04.399 --> 22:05.401
I...

22:06.211 --> 22:07.219
Wait...

22:11.277 --> 22:13.274
Come here. Hey, Zach!

22:13.342 --> 22:14.463
- Zach?
- What are you doing?

22:14.498 --> 22:17.678
Zach Riley!

22:17.714 --> 22:19.369
So great to see you!

22:19.417 --> 22:21.036
Boston!

22:21.106 --> 22:22.616
It's been... too long.

22:22.651 --> 22:24.420
Way too long!

22:24.455 --> 22:25.701
Oh, look at ya, huh?

22:25.736 --> 22:28.238
Hey, you put NASA out of business yet?

22:28.646 --> 22:30.901
Hey, I really want to introduce
you to somebody, all right?

22:30.925 --> 22:33.294
Zach Riley, visioneer of the future,

22:33.393 --> 22:35.432
please allow me to introduce Patterson.

22:35.496 --> 22:37.363
- Hi.
- The love of my life.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.082
Really? I thought you were...

22:39.117 --> 22:41.356
It is such an honor to meet you, Mr. Riley.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.666
Oh, my God, if I were a kid today,

22:43.734 --> 22:46.574
I... your just... your poster
would just be right between

22:46.675 --> 22:49.182
Albert Einstein and Marie Curie.

22:49.263 --> 22:50.785
I'm just a businessman who likes to dream.

22:50.809 --> 22:52.752
Wonderful, it has just been
such a treat and a half.

22:52.776 --> 22:55.183
Seriously, thank you
so much. Okay, have fun.

22:56.213 --> 22:57.910
Hands off, she's all mine.

22:57.945 --> 23:00.779
Weller, the code is 08...

23:00.814 --> 23:03.891
28... 07... 18.

23:05.194 --> 23:06.831
Uh, we're in.

23:06.909 --> 23:09.099
Okay, I'm floating all hard drive contents

23:09.177 --> 23:11.299
to Lenny and Squiggy
in the creepy black van.

23:11.334 --> 23:13.578
Reade, Tasha, data's coming your way.

23:13.648 --> 23:16.172
Look for anything indicating
a pending attack on U.S. soil.

23:16.256 --> 23:18.448
Weller! The guards are heading upstairs.

23:18.483 --> 23:21.033
- Rich, you better wrap it up.
- Just give me a minute.

23:21.718 --> 23:22.809
Rich...

23:22.877 --> 23:24.220
That's already been invented.

23:24.255 --> 23:25.057
- H-Has it?
- Yes.

23:25.092 --> 23:27.483
Well, why do it still have plaque?

23:27.518 --> 23:29.853
Well, okay, I'm gonna let you get
back to being a billionaire, I guess.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.803
It's so great to see you, huh?

23:31.838 --> 23:34.807
Sir, Gord Enver has been
located on the premises.

23:36.296 --> 23:38.469
Still tight with Gord, Boston?

23:38.504 --> 23:40.889
Uh... uh, Gord, yeah. We... we're, um...

23:40.924 --> 23:42.285
we're actually in the same complex,

23:42.309 --> 23:44.138
but we're not on civil terms right now.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.276
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

23:45.349 --> 23:46.749
What's in your hand?

23:51.171 --> 23:52.438
Nothing.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.620
Feel a little high
strung? Go join a quartet.

23:55.655 --> 23:56.984
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

23:57.031 --> 23:58.532
Weller, get out of there.

23:58.598 --> 23:59.731
Riley's coming your way.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.199
Thanks for the heads-up.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.594
What the hell are you doing, Gord?

24:18.629 --> 24:19.869
Mr. Riley, I'm the assistant...

24:19.940 --> 24:22.846
You know exactly what I'm doing here, Zach.

24:22.967 --> 24:24.846
I'm here for what's rightfully mine.

24:25.059 --> 24:28.015
Proof that I was the sole
inventor of RileyShare,

24:28.129 --> 24:30.764
that you stole that code
from me before you dropped out

24:30.806 --> 24:32.314
and moved to Silicon Valley,

24:32.349 --> 24:35.086
that your entire empire is built on a lie!

24:35.123 --> 24:38.073
That I, Gordon Meredith Enver,

24:38.108 --> 24:40.560
should be in your shoes,
breathing your rarefied air

24:40.649 --> 24:42.917
as a beloved visionary instead of...

24:42.995 --> 24:45.695
lurking, nameless and
thankless in the shadows,

24:45.765 --> 24:47.865
like some digital thug!

24:48.696 --> 24:49.963
Give us a moment.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.455
Gord... I'm so sorry...

24:54.665 --> 24:55.999
that you feel that way.

24:56.354 --> 24:58.316
But I didn't steal anything from you.

24:58.383 --> 25:00.240
Yeah, we developed some
of that code together,

25:00.343 --> 25:03.033
but then I begged you to move to
Silicon Valley with me to finish it.

25:03.057 --> 25:04.316
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

25:04.378 --> 25:07.165
Yes! I remember, because I couldn't believe

25:07.216 --> 25:09.150
how little faith you had in us.

25:09.202 --> 25:10.645
In yourself.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.681
The things we could've done together.

25:12.948 --> 25:14.889
But, no... you ran the numbers through

25:14.957 --> 25:18.893
that stupid formula and then
opted to stay and finish college.

25:18.974 --> 25:20.523
Take the safe route.

25:21.330 --> 25:23.146
Weller, we just found a
draft of a press release

25:23.170 --> 25:25.293
on Riley's laptop announcing
the sale of Riley Motors

25:25.328 --> 25:27.001
so he can focus more on his space efforts.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.755
Riley's getting out of
the lithium business.

25:28.790 --> 25:31.175
He's got no reason to be
part of this conspiracy.

25:31.567 --> 25:33.312
We're sorry about the mix-up.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.896
He gets a little carried
away sometimes, don't you?

25:35.944 --> 25:37.573
Uh, Gord, we should go.

25:37.688 --> 25:39.745
We've wasted enough of Mr. Riley's time.

25:39.821 --> 25:40.883
I'm sorry, sir.

25:40.918 --> 25:42.054
Gord...

25:42.984 --> 25:44.284
If you're up for it,

25:44.391 --> 25:45.737
there's always a spot for you on my team.

25:45.761 --> 25:48.479
- Oh, that is...
- That is very generous!

25:48.639 --> 25:49.990
I'm sure you'll hear from him.

25:50.025 --> 25:51.244
Let's go, honey.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.922
Hey... It's okay.

26:07.988 --> 26:09.875
We still have a couple
more addresses to try.

26:09.925 --> 26:11.726
Which is why we should
get back on the road.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.417
He needs to regain his composure,

26:17.514 --> 26:21.054
and I don't think his prison cell in
Zero Division is a good place to do that.

26:21.089 --> 26:23.110
Let's let him catch his breath, okay?

26:23.162 --> 26:24.986
Then we'll get right back out there.

26:25.021 --> 26:26.888
Okay, fine, but make it quick.

26:28.048 --> 26:29.382
Here you go.

26:33.372 --> 26:35.072
Place is a bit sparse.

26:35.187 --> 26:37.555
Haven't had much time to decorate.

26:37.682 --> 26:40.060
At least your doors open
when you want them to.

26:40.707 --> 26:42.141
They didn't always.

26:44.548 --> 26:46.439
- Nice flowers.
- _

26:46.474 --> 26:47.427
Who's Oliver?

26:47.493 --> 26:48.527
Just a friend.

26:57.457 --> 26:58.391
_

26:58.480 --> 26:59.697
_

27:04.446 --> 27:05.538
What is it?

27:06.218 --> 27:07.573
I remember something.

27:09.098 --> 27:12.110
All right, the tattoo
still points to Daedalus.

27:12.178 --> 27:14.690
Even if Zach Riley isn't
plotting a U.S. attack

27:14.745 --> 27:16.639
to trigger a war, someone else here is.

27:16.683 --> 27:20.066
From this point on,
every member is a suspect.

27:20.101 --> 27:22.200
<i>This is all Rich's fault.</i>

27:22.371 --> 27:23.865
Sends us on some wild goose chase

27:23.945 --> 27:26.016
because of a personal
grudge he can't let go of.

27:26.051 --> 27:27.994
Okay, is there an alumni
room here somewhere

27:28.029 --> 27:29.640
where we can get information?

27:29.720 --> 27:31.449
You know, it's always about Rich with Rich.

27:31.484 --> 27:33.410
He doesn't care about
other people's issues.

27:33.445 --> 27:35.285
- He doesn't...
- Would you shut up about Rich!

27:35.313 --> 27:37.689
You broke up, you just
need to deal with it.

27:37.785 --> 27:39.101
At least your ex didn't try to kill you

27:39.125 --> 27:40.884
and then hand you over to a madwoman

27:40.919 --> 27:42.741
to be tortured and exploit your grief

27:42.776 --> 27:44.281
over your one true love who died because

27:44.305 --> 27:45.939
you wouldn't move in with him.

27:48.206 --> 27:49.324
You feel better?

27:51.638 --> 27:52.721
Kinda.

27:52.756 --> 27:53.823
- Great.
- Yeah.

27:53.878 --> 27:54.773
Yeah.

27:54.808 --> 27:57.064
So can we talk about my problems again?

27:57.102 --> 27:59.274
- Okay.
- You know, Rich just will not shut up,

27:59.321 --> 28:01.872
and I have asked him
on numerous occasions...

28:05.250 --> 28:06.640
Reade, Tasha,

28:06.675 --> 28:08.248
keep searching through Riley's files.

28:08.380 --> 28:10.789
See if you can find out
who he sold Riley Motors to.

28:10.824 --> 28:12.525
We're looking for anyone who
can benefit from the invasion

28:12.549 --> 28:14.284
of a lithium-rich country.

28:14.351 --> 28:15.626
Zach's right, you know.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.105
I gave up on the software
to stay in college

28:17.129 --> 28:19.947
and finish my degree... a piece of paper.

28:19.982 --> 28:21.192
That's Congressman Kelley.

28:21.260 --> 28:22.691
He's on the Armed Forces Subcommittee.

28:22.715 --> 28:25.776
A piece of paper that cost
me billions of dollars, okay?

28:25.811 --> 28:27.272
Are you happy now, Mom and Dad, huh?

28:27.340 --> 28:28.568
- Why don't you take that piece of paper...
- Rich! Rich!

28:28.592 --> 28:29.640
...and roll it up real
tight and shove it up your...

28:29.664 --> 28:32.091
Shh! Rich. We're on a mission.

28:32.224 --> 28:33.650
Drop the existential crisis.

28:33.703 --> 28:35.460
Who cares about the mission?

28:35.924 --> 28:38.865
Kurt, listen. Don't be like me, okay?

28:38.900 --> 28:40.812
Don't waste your life on missions.

28:40.867 --> 28:41.979
You grab Jane now,

28:42.014 --> 28:43.140
before somebody else does,

28:43.215 --> 28:44.893
and then uses her to
make billions of dollars.

28:44.917 --> 28:46.395
I know that last part
didn't really make sense,

28:46.419 --> 28:47.819
but you see what I'm saying, right?

28:54.815 --> 28:56.015
What's going on?

28:57.353 --> 28:58.772
It's the Awakening.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.449
It's a sacred Daedalus ritual.

29:01.519 --> 29:03.550
This better not be a sex thing.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.702
If it is, we should probably
go along with it, right?

29:08.060 --> 29:09.798
We don't wanna blow our cover.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.518
I can't believe your real
name is Boston Arliss Crab.

29:12.599 --> 29:13.404
I thought it was an alias.

29:13.462 --> 29:15.100
You're making fun of my name
when your first name is...

29:15.124 --> 29:16.653
Wait, who's that guy?

29:17.901 --> 29:19.296
Excellent question.

29:21.348 --> 29:23.836
I got eyes on a shady-looking
dude headed straight for the exit.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.765
Follow him, but don't engage.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.192
- We're on our way.
- If you want the heart of a lion,

29:28.260 --> 29:31.100
you must first be willing to consume it.

29:31.583 --> 29:34.121
Who will be the first to partake with me?

29:34.558 --> 29:37.994
Stop! No one leaves once
the Awakening has begun.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.680
Uhh!

29:50.751 --> 29:51.751
Come on.

29:51.889 --> 29:54.212
Oh, you're definitely banned now, Gord.

29:54.247 --> 29:56.014
Oh, suck it, Phineas.

29:56.699 --> 29:58.956
- What's wrong with rich people?
- We get bored.

29:59.019 --> 30:00.668
Got an I.D. on the guy who left the party.

30:00.692 --> 30:03.121
His name is Benjamin Oren.

30:03.199 --> 30:05.498
He's an executive at
Northlake Military Contractors.

30:05.533 --> 30:07.476
Northlake stands to make
millions if an attack on the U.S.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.766
led to military action overseas.

30:09.801 --> 30:11.937
He's sending another text.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.178
Right. We're following him
into the Fine Arts building.

30:14.209 --> 30:17.175
Boston, what are you doing?

30:17.407 --> 30:18.407
Let's go!

30:20.426 --> 30:21.456
Okay.

30:23.567 --> 30:25.551
Ohh! Hi. We...

30:25.586 --> 30:27.492
We didn't know anybody was in here.

30:27.527 --> 30:29.673
W-We came in here to
have sex with each other.

30:29.743 --> 30:32.427
- Oh...
- We find each other incredibly attractive.

30:33.803 --> 30:35.076
Oh sonova.

30:43.795 --> 30:46.029
Uh... Boston!

30:53.292 --> 30:54.643
Patterson.

30:54.941 --> 30:57.207
Reade, Tasha... help me now.

30:57.329 --> 30:58.348
On our way.

30:59.647 --> 31:01.072
Rich, give me your hand.

31:01.170 --> 31:02.504
You're giving me a gun right now?

31:02.554 --> 31:04.428
We are totally leveling
up on our friendship.

31:04.501 --> 31:05.850
- What are you doing?
- Give me your other hand!

31:05.874 --> 31:06.807
I'm saving your life.

31:06.883 --> 31:08.082
Here.

31:08.117 --> 31:10.248
- Ow!
- You don't wanna run towards gunfire.

31:10.283 --> 31:13.849
Gunfire doesn't kill
people! People kill people!

31:15.387 --> 31:17.460
I guess, technically,
gunfire does kill people.

31:19.966 --> 31:21.080
Gah! Uhh!

31:24.453 --> 31:25.736
- Aah!
- Sorry!

31:27.061 --> 31:28.194
Uhh!

31:29.846 --> 31:31.347
Ohh!

31:31.382 --> 31:32.683
Down!

31:33.015 --> 31:34.249
Uhh!

31:38.549 --> 31:40.984
Drop it. F.B.I. Drop the weapon.

31:41.019 --> 31:42.695
- Move!
- Ohh!

31:49.037 --> 31:50.138
Gord?

31:50.320 --> 31:52.037
Hey, Thad, you wouldn't happen to have

31:52.072 --> 31:54.397
a tie clip or a hairpin on you, would you?

31:54.432 --> 31:55.632
Little trouble with your date?

31:55.700 --> 31:57.551
No, it's nothing like that.

31:57.605 --> 31:58.620
It's, um...

31:59.947 --> 32:01.571
All right, look, I'm with the F.B.I.

32:01.606 --> 32:03.157
There's some heavy-duty
stuff going down right now,

32:03.181 --> 32:04.937
and I need to help stop it.

32:06.151 --> 32:07.882
You're about to pull a
gun on me, aren't you?

32:07.906 --> 32:09.948
Wha... what makes you say that, Gord?

32:09.983 --> 32:12.216
The fact that you left
the Awakening Ceremony.

32:12.316 --> 32:14.069
You're not fleeing from
the sound of gunfire.

32:14.093 --> 32:16.962
Also, there's a pistol-shaped
bulge in your jacket.

32:16.997 --> 32:17.997
Ohh...

32:18.038 --> 32:19.841
Jeez!

32:19.876 --> 32:21.614
You crazy? You could have hit me!

32:22.137 --> 32:24.661
You're lucky I need someone
like you alive, Gord.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.629
Or should I say Rich.com?

32:29.546 --> 32:31.814
Here, is this the restaurant?

32:32.233 --> 32:35.272
Yeah, this is it. I was watching
for a truck over there and...

32:35.393 --> 32:38.104
Weller was sitting right in that
window with a... with a woman.

32:38.975 --> 32:39.975
Who?

32:43.118 --> 32:46.175
Agh! I don't know, I...

32:46.278 --> 32:49.250
Look, uh, I need to go
and check in with Weller.

32:49.324 --> 32:50.222
Take him inside.

32:50.267 --> 32:51.501
Yeah, okay.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.660
Roman...

32:59.592 --> 33:00.592
Roman.

33:24.662 --> 33:26.255
- I killed her.
- Who?

33:26.314 --> 33:27.608
It's okay, Emma.

33:29.919 --> 33:32.841
Emma. Uh... Weller's friend.

33:32.906 --> 33:35.040
- Middle-aged, dark hair?
- Yeah.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.072
Weller said Emma Shaw died in a
car accident less than a year ago.

33:42.093 --> 33:44.242
You killed Taylor Shaw's mother.

33:44.277 --> 33:46.037
Why? Why would I do that?

33:46.099 --> 33:48.441
Because Emma would have
known I wasn't her daughter.

33:49.158 --> 33:51.827
Shepherd was protecting my cover story.

33:51.862 --> 33:53.218
Tying up loose threads.

33:53.253 --> 33:55.779
By making me kill an innocent person.

33:56.587 --> 33:58.916
- We need to tell Nas.
- No, Roman, wait...

33:59.627 --> 34:01.537
Weller can't find out through her.

34:01.608 --> 34:03.236
Okay? Let me tell him.

34:03.970 --> 34:06.896
The Shaw family was very important to him.

34:06.931 --> 34:08.851
He'll take it better coming from me.

34:10.443 --> 34:11.525
Let's go.

34:14.474 --> 34:17.116
So you're telling me your plan was
to steal a bunch of radioactive crap

34:17.139 --> 34:19.967
and then detonate a dirty
bomb at your alma mater?

34:20.003 --> 34:21.603
One of my partners was
supposed to unlock this,

34:21.628 --> 34:24.688
but he's indisposed, so... get to hacking!

34:24.745 --> 34:26.228
This is not a good plan, okay?

34:26.264 --> 34:28.951
I mean, no offense, but everyone's
gonna know it was an inside job.

34:29.021 --> 34:30.661
Actually, they'll figure it was him.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.893
A Bolivian rebel with an axe
to grind against the U.S.,

34:32.956 --> 34:35.589
killed while stealing
some pretty scary stuff.

34:36.143 --> 34:37.443
Bolivia.

34:37.579 --> 34:38.942
A lithium-rich country.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.677
With a government... about to collapse.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.824
Thad, come on. This isn't you.

34:43.859 --> 34:46.277
You dick around with
pharmaceutical prices, not war!

34:46.344 --> 34:49.723
Business is business, and thanks to
my recent acquisition of Riley motors,

34:49.757 --> 34:51.661
business just got very, very good.

34:51.731 --> 34:53.985
- Zach sold to you?
- And a few other members.

34:54.041 --> 34:55.264
Lithium was getting too expensive,

34:55.288 --> 34:56.753
but we're not gonna have that problem.

34:56.777 --> 34:58.297
No, but the F.B.I.'s already onto you.

34:58.323 --> 34:59.439
They're gonna know the truth.

34:59.463 --> 35:02.372
Once this bomb goes off,
the truth isn't gonna matter.

35:02.407 --> 35:05.063
Tomorrow morning, when an
entire U.S. city is glowing red,

35:05.098 --> 35:07.938
nobody's gonna care what a couple of
Feds and their pet rat have to say.

35:07.990 --> 35:09.398
Now hack!

35:10.108 --> 35:13.271
I'm sorry, but my Buddhist teachings
prohibit me from contributing to violence.

35:13.306 --> 35:15.296
Ohh! Oh, my God.

35:15.364 --> 35:16.808
You shot me in the foot!

35:16.876 --> 35:19.222
Next time, I aim higher.

35:19.443 --> 35:20.879
Okay, okay.

35:29.814 --> 35:32.206
Benjamin Oren's still unconscious.
The other guy's just a Northlake grunt.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.484
- Doesn't know much.
- And Rich went missing.

35:33.508 --> 35:35.937
- He ran, again.
- Start tracking him.

35:36.741 --> 35:37.905
I found this on Oren.

35:37.940 --> 35:39.293
What's it for?

35:39.363 --> 35:41.589
I don't know, but I recognize the letters.

35:41.675 --> 35:43.630
Riley School of Alternative Energy.

35:43.685 --> 35:47.084
The school has a hazardous
materials containment system.

35:47.152 --> 35:48.219
Right here on campus.

35:48.286 --> 35:50.340
- How hazardous?
- Radioactive.

35:50.413 --> 35:52.160
We figured out who Oren was texting with.

35:52.199 --> 35:55.133
Thad Munson... they just pinged Thad's
phone at the school of alternative energy.

35:55.157 --> 35:56.958
He's there right now with Rich.

35:56.993 --> 36:00.231
We got the key... so Thad's using Rich
to break out this nuclear material.

36:00.266 --> 36:01.987
They're not here to plan an attack.

36:02.057 --> 36:03.524
They're here to execute one.

36:06.143 --> 36:08.657
Reade, Tasha, anything on your floors?

36:08.692 --> 36:10.119
<i>- Not yet.
- Negative.</i>

36:10.169 --> 36:13.359
Patterson, get a local PD to
help us lock down The Labyrinth

36:13.394 --> 36:14.961
until we know who else is involved.

36:15.034 --> 36:17.756
Call in HAZMAT and pray to
God that we don't need them.

36:21.719 --> 36:23.382
No! You're too late!

36:23.437 --> 36:24.388
Oh-kay...

36:24.456 --> 36:25.806
Munson, let him go.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.435
Turn around, Fed, or
your Buddhist friend here

36:27.459 --> 36:28.848
gets his third eye!

36:28.883 --> 36:30.113
Third eye is actually a Hindu...

36:30.137 --> 36:31.304
Shut up!

36:33.385 --> 36:35.019
I'm sorry, Rich.

36:35.211 --> 36:36.946
I can't let him get
away with that container.

36:36.970 --> 36:38.479
That's okay, why are you apologizing to me?

36:38.503 --> 36:39.154
- I don't know why...
- 'Cause...

36:39.189 --> 36:40.817
Ohh! Ohh!

36:40.857 --> 36:42.227
- Put the gun down.
- Okay!

36:42.262 --> 36:43.462
Back up.

36:45.607 --> 36:47.210
Strontium's been contained.

36:47.285 --> 36:48.527
- Send me an ambulance.
- Agh!

36:48.591 --> 36:50.025
Rich has been shot.

36:51.497 --> 36:52.587
Twice.

36:52.622 --> 36:54.256
You shot the hostage.

36:54.606 --> 36:57.788
Your obsession with the movie
"Speed" has become very unhealthy.

37:00.583 --> 37:02.726
You know, Boston,

37:02.827 --> 37:05.095
I might actually miss you
when you go to California.

37:05.130 --> 37:06.297
Hmm.

37:07.296 --> 37:09.867
- _
- Wait...

37:09.935 --> 37:11.602
You made this?

37:12.398 --> 37:14.233
In a different life.

37:14.372 --> 37:17.195
Well... it's incredible.

37:18.561 --> 37:21.467
How does someone this
talented become a criminal?

37:24.366 --> 37:25.837
I followed my heart.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.789
Stupid, right?

37:34.377 --> 37:37.746
So what are the chances I get a full
pardon now that I'm a national hero?

37:37.816 --> 37:40.818
You do realize that your work
with us is highly classified?

37:40.853 --> 37:42.701
Well, don't I get a medal of some kind?

37:42.756 --> 37:44.068
Purple Heart, Silver Star?

37:44.103 --> 37:45.337
Redemption's its own reward.

37:45.413 --> 37:49.249
Ah, stupid spiritual enlightenment.

37:49.485 --> 37:50.941
Ow! Jeez, that's close.

37:51.009 --> 37:52.179
See ya.

37:52.226 --> 37:55.388
What if I told you I could
help you solve another tattoo?

37:57.349 --> 37:58.872
What? I'm here every other week.

37:58.907 --> 38:00.714
You don't think I know
what you guys are up to?

38:00.738 --> 38:02.162
What'll it cost us?

38:02.249 --> 38:06.654
All I want is for Boston to be
transferred to a minimum security facility.

38:06.712 --> 38:09.777
The white collar kind. Tennis
courts and macramé classes.

38:09.812 --> 38:12.186
Then, at the earliest possible chance,

38:12.272 --> 38:13.760
he gets out on good behavior.

38:13.846 --> 38:16.007
Which religion is telling you to do this?

38:16.042 --> 38:18.011
Actually, I was thinking
of starting one of my own.

38:18.035 --> 38:19.481
- That's terrifying.
- Wow...

38:19.516 --> 38:20.666
How dare you.

38:20.753 --> 38:21.897
So what have you got?

38:21.982 --> 38:24.641
I may have done a little
snooping around the Jane Doe files

38:24.716 --> 38:26.110
last time I paid you two a visit.

38:26.145 --> 38:27.579
Of course you did.

38:28.832 --> 38:30.309
Recognize this?

38:31.855 --> 38:33.489
Because I sure do.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.722
Hey... um...

38:38.787 --> 38:40.406
I've been reading Dr. Sun's file.

38:40.441 --> 38:41.406
- Look...
- Hey, if you want me

38:41.441 --> 38:42.539
to open up to a therapist

38:42.602 --> 38:45.543
post-Borden, I'm damn well
gonna do my homework on them.

38:46.253 --> 38:48.299
I wanted to know why
she left Zero Division.

38:48.366 --> 38:50.582
Look, that file doesn't
tell the whole story.

38:50.617 --> 38:52.314
It says that she was there...

38:52.400 --> 38:54.264
when Sandstorm infiltrated your group.

38:54.299 --> 38:57.036
And that she voiced concerns
about the team member

38:57.104 --> 38:59.546
that later turned out to be compromised.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.906
But no one listened to her.

39:03.214 --> 39:04.701
I didn't listen.

39:04.736 --> 39:06.803
Because you were too close to the mole?

39:08.556 --> 39:10.275
How did you get over it?

39:12.223 --> 39:16.293
That feeling of... being betrayed.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.889
I... I didn't.

39:19.963 --> 39:22.831
And... and it cost me dearly.

39:23.367 --> 39:25.848
But, look, Patterson,
you still have a chance.

39:25.929 --> 39:27.564
Talk to Dr. Sun.

39:28.435 --> 39:30.193
Put Borden behind you.

39:43.711 --> 39:44.985
Nikki?

39:47.792 --> 39:49.572
_

40:15.840 --> 40:17.616
You think Patterson
will be pleased or pissed

40:17.651 --> 40:20.224
when she finds out Rich cracked a tattoo?

40:20.337 --> 40:21.181
Pissed.

40:21.265 --> 40:22.581
Definitely pissed.

40:22.659 --> 40:24.437
Yeah. How'd it go today?

40:24.519 --> 40:26.921
Roman, did he... remember anything?

40:26.956 --> 40:28.012
No.

40:28.047 --> 40:29.233
It was worth a shot.

40:29.468 --> 40:30.468
We'll find her.

40:30.507 --> 40:31.522
Shepherd.

40:32.552 --> 40:33.971
Yeah.

40:34.091 --> 40:35.372
Wasn't so bad,

40:35.527 --> 40:37.836
out in the field today, with Rich.

40:38.476 --> 40:41.326
Maybe he is finding his... soul.

40:41.380 --> 40:42.794
Well, plus, you got to shoot him.

40:42.829 --> 40:44.097
I wish you could have seen that.

40:44.121 --> 40:45.121
Me, too.

40:47.141 --> 40:48.220
I gotta go.

40:48.255 --> 40:49.226
A hot date?

40:49.261 --> 40:51.288
No, I... Well, I mean...

40:51.998 --> 40:55.103
Yeah, but it's not, you
know, it's not... it's...

40:56.125 --> 40:57.052
It's a date.

40:57.087 --> 40:58.517
So...

40:59.275 --> 41:00.497
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:01.368 --> 41:02.783
See you tomorrow.

41:05.989 --> 41:07.124
_

41:07.660 --> 41:09.331
_

41:14.431 --> 41:16.329
Tell me you have something
on Truman Protocol.

41:16.395 --> 41:20.128
It seems to be a series of meetings
that took place in the '40s...

41:20.163 --> 41:22.919
in the buildup to the dropping
of the A-bomb on Hiroshima.

41:22.954 --> 41:24.843
So what has that got to
do with Sandstorm now?

41:24.909 --> 41:26.437
I don't know.

41:26.500 --> 41:30.561
You know, I've been in the business
of secrets for my entire life, and...

41:30.661 --> 41:32.431
I've never encountered
anything this buried.

41:32.528 --> 41:35.732
You're telling me that every Truman
Protocol file has been redacted?

41:35.800 --> 41:37.082
No...

41:37.117 --> 41:39.555
I'm telling you that there are no files.

41:39.590 --> 41:41.716
That whatever the Truman protocol was,

41:41.773 --> 41:45.158
somebody has worked very hard
to have it completely erased.

41:52.948 --> 41:54.666
The F.B.I. was all over me today.

41:54.701 --> 41:56.868
They were just after Munson and his crew.

41:57.111 --> 42:00.085
Relax. He's taken care of.

42:00.387 --> 42:01.805
Some advance notice would be nice.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.027
Shepherd's not big on notice.

42:05.085 --> 42:08.268
You sure the F.B.I. knows
nothing about our arrangement?

42:08.350 --> 42:10.899
Well, not unless you said something.

42:10.989 --> 42:12.855
I'd die before I told anyone.

42:12.890 --> 42:14.191
Yes...
