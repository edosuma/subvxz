01:36.096 --> 01:38.616
This weekend, but I thought
he was with them. I don't know.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.574
I don't know.

01:39.658 --> 01:41.018
- Thank you.
- I don't know.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.020
Wait, where's Mario? I
was hoping to see him.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.147
He went with his new
bougie girlfriend to Nevada.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.190
- Instead of coming home?
- He's in the bone zone.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.567
- True.
- True.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.778
- Can you pass the tres leches?
- Oh, okay.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.656
My mom makes the best tres
leches for my birthday.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.159
Guess not this year.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.162
Don't say that. Maybe your folks
will be home before your birthday.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.581
In a week? I don't think so.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.708
Wait, your quince is in a week?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.293
And you didn't tell us?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.252
Mom, Dad, Olivia's quince is in a week!

02:08.336 --> 02:09.920
It's not a big deal.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.214
What?

02:12.007 --> 02:14.551
- Mija, is that true?
- Mm-hmm.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.279
Olivia, don't worry about a thing.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.756
I'm gonna get my shifts covered at work

02:17.757 --> 02:19.970
and we'll do it here next Saturday.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.767
Oh, my God!

02:22.392 --> 02:23.832
Olivia's having a chupacabra!

02:24.686 --> 02:25.896
Oh, my God.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.201
No, roses.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.495
Picture it! Roses.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.664
And we use basic patterns...

02:57.135 --> 03:00.013
- Hey, why'd you disappear?
- I just needed to get some air.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.766
You okay?

03:06.186 --> 03:09.106
Can you do that girlie thing
where you get soft and supportive?

03:09.689 --> 03:10.982
- I do that?
- No.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.192
But can you?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.625
You don't have to do this.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.087
We're not doing
anything. This is for me.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.170
And me.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.092
Don't know why, but we
both felt the need to hug.

03:39.177 --> 03:43.181
I can't believe I'm about to have
my first birthday without my parents

03:43.265 --> 03:44.766
and it's my quince.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.479
It's so ironic. I mean,
since I was able to walk,

03:50.021 --> 03:53.066
my mother has driven me crazy
talking about my quinceañera.

03:54.109 --> 03:57.863
Trying recipes, cutting
magazines, making playlists.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.117
And my dad,

04:02.200 --> 04:05.662
practicing our waltz so
he'd have it down on the day.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.831
He's been practicing for years.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.249
Years!

04:11.501 --> 04:13.795
- That's a lot of dancing.
- Yeah.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.757
And he has no rhythm. Like none.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.887
So, my feet are all shredded, all
in the name of my mother's obsession,

04:22.471 --> 04:24.306
which I used to pray would stop.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.391
But now that it has...

04:28.769 --> 04:30.353
I miss it.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.482
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.776
You just totally and
completely devastated Olivia

04:35.777 --> 04:37.444
by suggesting she have a quince.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.797
What's new with RollerWorld?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.490
Ha! Nothing.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.741
Nada.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.535
- I hit a dead end.
- What do you mean a dead end?

04:45.619 --> 04:49.706
Like a literal dead one.
Like Lil' Ricky is dead.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.085
After the football game, I
followed Oscar's lead to an address.

04:54.503 --> 04:58.381
And it took me to a graveyard
where I found Lil' Ricky's grave.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.718
He died in 1982, 19
months after the heist.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.386
But how? Why?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.806
Did the Prophets disembowel
him through his throat?

05:05.889 --> 05:08.517
Seriously, woman, we're
psychically linked.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.175
Those exact same
questions crossed my mind,

05:11.176 --> 05:13.063
which is why I had to go deep.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.733
I had to go where I never
thought I'd need to go.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.944
Oh, dear. Jamal, where'd you go?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.445
The library.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.050
That night I pulled an all-nighter

05:22.051 --> 05:24.200
doing some serious
fishing with the fiche.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.177
- How do you fish with fish?
- It's microfiche.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.801
- Micro what?
- Micro nothing.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.122
There was no evidence
of Ricky's passing.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.249
No obit.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.709
So, that's it.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.004
The end. El Fin.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.883
Aren't those little homies funny?

05:41.967 --> 05:43.426
Gnomies.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.970
Gnomies!

05:45.053 --> 05:46.930
Yes. Anyways,

05:47.013 --> 05:49.182
Ricky is dead and so are our leads.

05:49.808 --> 05:53.353
Beep. Beep. Beep.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.521
We have a lead.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.605
Go here.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.567
Whoever is paying for the
flowers on the grave knew Ricky

05:58.650 --> 06:00.318
and may know RollerWorld.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.738
Beep. Beep.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.532
Beep. Beep.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.568
Beep.

06:08.571 --> 06:11.079
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to rub salt on the wound.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.914
It's not your fault.

06:14.666 --> 06:18.378
I haven't seen my parents in months
and I've barely talked to them.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.380
It's just a nightmare situation.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.175
Which is why you should have a party!

06:24.259 --> 06:26.136
Ruby, she doesn't want to celebrate.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.887
- Are you even listening?
- I am.

06:27.971 --> 06:31.308
And what I'm hearing is how
important this party is to her mom.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.561
- I can't do it without her.
- But that's why you have to.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.355
You're not betraying your mom to
have a quince if she's not here,

06:37.439 --> 06:38.686
but you would be betraying her

06:38.687 --> 06:41.181
to not have one because she's not here.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.485
Not after all her planning.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.238
I never thought of it that way.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.083
Because I'm good at
making people understand

06:47.084 --> 06:48.575
the right side of an argument.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.618
- Or annoying them into submission.
- So...

06:51.119 --> 06:52.954
Do you have any ideas
about what you want?

06:55.999 --> 06:58.126
Everyone, please open your e-devices

06:58.209 --> 07:00.420
and find the e-mail I
sent titled "Winning".

07:00.503 --> 07:02.255
Find it? Good.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.000
Because after copious hours of searching

07:04.001 --> 07:05.675
through Olivia's quincespirations,

07:05.759 --> 07:08.094
I've compiled the best
ideas on a Pinterest page

07:08.178 --> 07:10.347
on the link below her headshot.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.765
Where's Olivia?

07:11.848 --> 07:15.560
The princesa doesn't need to
be bothered with the details.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.606
Now, anyone else have a
dumb question? Huh? Good.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.651
And before we really get
going, I'd like to remind you

07:22.734 --> 07:24.444
that we're not just friends and family,

07:24.527 --> 07:27.238
we're damas and chambelanes
in Olivia's court de honor,

07:27.322 --> 07:31.076
which means being
honorable and dedicated.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.663
So, take a look at our mandatory
rehearsal schedule and...

07:36.539 --> 07:37.779
Excuse me. I need to take this.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.751
Ruby's Fancy Festivities.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.004
What do you mean?

07:44.005 --> 07:45.885
- Think that's your mom?
- Yeah.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.509
Just do it.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.095
Laura Diaz?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.681
I couldn't use my real name.
I don't want to scare her off.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.205
You know, the more I think about
this, the more I realize this is dumb.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.856
No way is my mom some rich lady
living ten miles away from here.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.066
I shouldn't do this.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.402
ADD FRIEND
- PENDING

08:05.485 --> 08:07.112
- What did you do?
- What you needed to.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.131
But I don't know if I want
to know what I don't know.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.199
- Then undo it. Unfriend her.
- Wait, no.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.703
But what if she's online
right now and sees it?

08:14.786 --> 08:16.162
Unfriending would be offensive.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.432
And I might be ready to friend
her later. She'll think that...

08:18.456 --> 08:20.458
Yeah, yeah. I'll take
my business elsewhere.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.168
I'm back. Sorry.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.781
Apparently ordering
a goat-drawn carriage

08:23.782 --> 08:25.463
is more complicated than I thought.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.466
Who knew there was a goat
wranglers union? I kid you not.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.427
- Pun intended.
- Whatever, man.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.429
So, we're gonna need
to rethink the carriage,

08:32.511 --> 08:34.264
which I'll get to in a moment,

08:34.806 --> 08:36.099
unless...

08:36.765 --> 08:38.351
You all think the twins can pull it?

08:38.977 --> 08:39.894
No.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.270
Fine. Moving on.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.982
The following are individual
responsibilities...

08:44.065 --> 08:46.276
- I'll handle music.
- Great minds think alike, compa.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.030
Monse, given your expert penmanship,
you're gonna do invitations.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.407
- No.
- Use cardstock.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.410
Jamal, you can cater. And
by you, I mean your dad.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.162
- How many people?
- Well...

08:57.245 --> 08:59.789
there's us, and then the block, and...

08:59.873 --> 09:02.333
- Three hundred.
- Three hundred people!?

09:03.084 --> 09:04.753
You're right. Better make it 350.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.839
Jamal will do the flowers.
I will do the food.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.507
What do I know about flowers?

09:09.591 --> 09:13.762
Nothing, which is why you
need to go to Mr. Greenthumb.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.683
Mr. Greenthumb... will help you.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.686
Oh, Mr. Greenthumb.

09:51.883 --> 09:52.883
Uh...

09:52.926 --> 09:54.969
I saw the flowers you
did at the cemetery.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.350
I can't remember the
name of the dead guy.

09:57.351 --> 09:59.600
Someone named Nicky or Dicky...

09:59.682 --> 10:00.809
- Ricky.
- Right.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.478
Ricky.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.561
Loved the plot, man.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.981
Okay. So, uh...

10:08.191 --> 10:11.444
I need some flowers for a quinceañera.

10:11.528 --> 10:15.365
I was thinking something in the vein
of Ricky's grave, but for a party.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.826
How much did those clients pay?

10:18.785 --> 10:21.037
You probably don't remember. No biggie.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.082
Could you just pass along
their info and I'll ask them?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.334
No.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.460
No?

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
Ricky was my cousin.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.840
- What do you have?
- Nothing.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.425
It's just a flashlight pen.
But take it, it's yours.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.971
Oh, for the flowers.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.681
Fifty bucks.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.058
Sounds like three bins of baby's breath.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.342
This is for a Quinceañera,
not a rustic hipster wedding.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.153
Screw hipsters.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.655
All they ever buy is succulents.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.741
- Fifty dollars don't look good, homie.
- I know. I'm sorry.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.118
Wasn't talking to you.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.378
You crochet?

11:10.461 --> 11:11.504
Bake?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.131
Tickle?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.557
Julio thinks we could trade with sweat.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.517
You lift for me,

11:24.601 --> 11:26.311
I arrange for you.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.187
- Lift what?
- Everything.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.189
Me and Julio got into it.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.529
His old lady, Juanita, left him.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.531
He blamed it on me.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.116
Thought we had a thing going on,

11:40.199 --> 11:41.451
but we didn't.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.120
She wasn't a ride or die.

11:44.579 --> 11:45.413
Right, homie?

11:46.581 --> 11:47.957
- Yeah...
- Wasn't talking to you.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.466
So, um...

11:56.549 --> 11:59.093
I'm in for the work for flowers trade.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.220
When should I start?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.389
You already have.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.912
So, he's a little eccentric.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.104
He's not eccentric, he's a quincecabra.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.942
Monse, you're consistently
failing with your face.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.318
See what I'm doing? It's body.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.402
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.486
Then face.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.716
If people are looking at your face,
they can't tell how much you suck.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.952
- Sorry I'm late.
- Silencio!

12:24.494 --> 12:26.414
No one wants to hear your
excuses. Look at Cesar.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.122
Or don't. The point is,

12:28.206 --> 12:31.668
he takes time in life and death
situations to be prompt and you don't.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.170
Everybody, again, from the top.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.972
It's a square, people. It's a square.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.662
Turn.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.855
And down. And one, and
two, and three, and...

12:53.898 --> 12:54.898
Guys!

12:55.441 --> 12:56.442
No. No.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.528
You're not even trying.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.447
Ruby, you're a natural, we're not.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.491
- We need an easier routine.
- Or no routine.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.035
Nonsense! You just need some practice.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.829
And I have some backup.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.914
- She should be here any minute.
- Who?

13:09.998 --> 13:12.917
The talent, bitches. Hey!

13:27.473 --> 13:30.059
♪ Yo, drop that track ♪

13:43.239 --> 13:44.407
♪ Oh, my goodness ♪

13:45.533 --> 13:47.076
- Ow!
- And that's just a taste.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.786
Yeah, I got you shook.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.706
You see, I'm like a Tootsie Pop.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.083
You got to keep licking
to get to the surprise.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.627
- Is that my dress?
- Nope.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.713
Maybe. Yeah.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.965
Don't get worked up. It's just on loan.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.443
But now there's a big hole in the back.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.636
Yeah, where you stabbed me in
that "Everybody kill Jasmine" game.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.181
I shouldn't even be here right now,

14:08.264 --> 14:09.974
- but I have a heart.
- Heart.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.412
Plus it's your quince

14:11.413 --> 14:13.352
and I don't wanna regret
not being one of your damas

14:13.436 --> 14:15.146
when we live together in our twenties.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.439
Now let's get to work.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.732
Music to my ears.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.734
Everybody, grab your partners.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.987
Olivia and Cesar, Jamal
and Monse, me and Jasmine.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.615
That's music to my ears.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.326
On second thought, better
pair the good with the bad.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.619
You go work with Jamal.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.162
- Monse!
- Hi.

14:31.788 --> 14:32.789
Oh.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.838
Don't give me that look.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.965
- But you said I needed better face.
- Yeah...

14:43.049 --> 14:45.134
but not the kind that
makes you look ugly.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.303
Better face, not bitter face.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.448
I'm gonna shut up right now
and silently hate on you.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.016
Okay. Just don't look at
your feet while you do it.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.143
Head up, shoulders back.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.150
He tripped because he's
looking at his feet.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.485
So ironic.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.279
Actually, it's not ironic.
It's counterintuitive.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.408
Irony would be the fact we're
dancing with each other and not them.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.118
They look really good together.

15:11.828 --> 15:16.165
Yeah. And what was I thinking? Girls
like that don't go for guys like me.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.430
- Why not?
- Same reason guys like Cesar

15:19.431 --> 15:20.920
don't go for girls like you.

15:33.224 --> 15:36.102
No one is into this
quince, including me.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.980
I need you to talk to Ruby.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
And say what?

15:40.523 --> 15:42.650
That I want to call it off.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.943
No way! You do it.

15:44.026 --> 15:47.613
I can't. I've already broken his
heart once. I can't do it again.

15:47.697 --> 15:48.697
But you can.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.950
Please, as my dama.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.120
If we're calling off your
quince, I'm not your dama anymore.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.496
You are until it's over.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.081
Here he comes. Oh.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.629
- Ruby, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, me too.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.840
You think your dad's
18-wheeler could hold a horse?

16:05.923 --> 16:08.410
- Why?
- Well, I found a dancing horse in Barstow,

16:08.415 --> 16:10.052
but I need to provide its transpo

16:10.136 --> 16:11.220
to and from the party.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.723
That's it. Ruby, you've
become a total quincecabra.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.974
- A what?
- A monster!

16:15.057 --> 16:17.643
You're too wrapped up in this
party and driving us all crazy

16:17.727 --> 16:19.060
and potentially shortening our lives

16:19.061 --> 16:21.647
with all this unnecessary
anxiety. And...

16:21.731 --> 16:23.316
And this is about Cesar.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.319
I saw the way you looked at him
when he was dancing with Olivia.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.202
It's classic transference. You're
mad at him, so you take it out on me.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.157
I'm not mad at Cesar.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.408
There it is again.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.120
"I." "I" this and "I" that.
Monse, this isn't about you.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.204
It's about Olivia.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.874
You got to put jealousy
aside and stop being selfish.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.667
It's not a good look on you.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.839
Oh, and I'm still gonna need
you to get that 18-wheeler.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.771
So?

16:51.775 --> 16:53.012
Ruby's getting you a horse.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.563
All right. So, what's next?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.111
Should I rearrange the sundials?

17:04.112 --> 17:06.359
They won't sell if
people can't see them.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.444
Don't touch those things.
They belong to Ricky.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.364
Take a break. Julio
thinks you're dehydrated.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.712
You like puzzles?

17:26.796 --> 17:28.130
Sure. Who doesn't?

17:29.382 --> 17:30.758
Riddles?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.510
Scavenger hunts?

17:33.010 --> 17:35.346
- Ever seen Goonies?
- I am Goonies.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.392
Goonies would have been
Ricky's favorite movie,

17:39.475 --> 17:41.269
but he died before it came out.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.105
- You must've really loved your cousin.
- He was cool.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.815
He helped me start this place,

17:45.898 --> 17:48.568
put in his own money,
even got his hands dirty.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.903
But he was a terrible rapper.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.863
Nobody could even tell
him how bad he was.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.534
He once rhymed "hair" with "hair."

17:57.577 --> 18:00.329
Do you remember how Lil'
Ricky was with finances?

18:00.413 --> 18:03.124
Like did he ever suddenly
come into a lot of money?

18:03.624 --> 18:04.959
And if so, did he hide it?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.420
Like under a mattress
or in someone's backyard?

18:14.385 --> 18:15.428
You're the one.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.138
The one what?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.105
The one who's going to
find the RollerWorld money.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.523
You know about RollerWorld?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.453
- Was Ricky involved?
- I didn't say that...

18:30.943 --> 18:32.278
but I didn't not say that.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.740
Come back tonight and I
will tell you everything.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.784
- Why not now?
- Too many ears.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.478
I only trust Julio.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.583
What time?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.627
I don't know. 7:00?

18:47.710 --> 18:48.711
Not you.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.884
7:43. Bring dinner.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.929
Thai food, pizza, donuts, pastrami.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.681
Where am I gonna get all that?

19:05.853 --> 19:06.854
Mother Phuket.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.776
Unacceptable!

19:11.859 --> 19:13.986
- What's up?
- Jamal just late-cancelled practice.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.112
He's fired.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.316
- We need a replacement.
- Oh, I can dance both parts!

19:18.282 --> 19:20.660
- We can't replace Jamal.
- I don't know anyone else.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.204
Well, consider this an
opportunity to make new friends.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.540
Thank you.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.213
- You avail Saturday for a quince?
- Ruby!

19:32.296 --> 19:33.798
What? He's the right height.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.426
I'm sorry. The ladies have no vision.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.556
- Okay, let's dive in.
- Yes!

19:42.640 --> 19:44.433
Not... Not the food!

19:44.517 --> 19:45.935
Let's dive into the agenda.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.938
Food is for inspiration.
Food is for closers.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.064
Okay, I'll start.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.334
So it turns out the dancing
horse doesn't actually dance.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.943
I can dance that part too.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.863
What? I don't see
anyone else stepping up!

19:57.947 --> 20:00.408
Cesar, what do you think about
riding bareback with a sword?

20:00.491 --> 20:01.951
Where am I gonna get a sword?

20:02.034 --> 20:04.120
- Agh, do I have to do everything myself?
- No!

20:04.954 --> 20:06.497
What's the problem, princesa?

20:06.580 --> 20:09.083
You! You're the problem.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.419
Take dinner. We're adjourned.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.254
But you haven't earned it yet!

20:13.337 --> 20:14.337
Enough!

20:14.964 --> 20:18.509
A quince is supposed to be a
celebration, but now it's a chore.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.178
Nobody wants to do
this, least of all me.

20:21.762 --> 20:22.762
It's cancelled.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.849
- The quince is off.
- Wha...

20:26.267 --> 20:27.560
See you at school tomorrow.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.569
Chivo?

20:38.529 --> 20:39.655
Julio?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.535
Jesus Christ.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.585
Do you always sit like this for dinner?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.044
Sit like what?

20:55.337 --> 20:56.213
Where can I sit?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.923
Kick it by the cacti.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.800
While you're at it, re-pot them.

21:00.551 --> 21:01.886
They look depressed.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.556
RollerWorld and some
food when you're done.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.692
Yeah?

21:20.946 --> 21:23.824
I'm sorry. I guess I
got a little out of hand.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.117
A little?

21:25.201 --> 21:27.703
You ordered an ice
luge to serve horchata.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.247
What can I say, I'm passionate.

21:30.331 --> 21:34.210
And obsessive, controlling, overbearing.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.170
I wanted to help with your heartbreak.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.507
I'm not good at sitting with
feelings. I gotta work it out.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.927
So when people say
sleep on it, I never do.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.429
I may nap on it, but I never sleep.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.515
I get right to the problem and fix it,

21:47.598 --> 21:51.519
but in this case, it can't be fixed.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.395
And I'm sorry.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.733
I didn't respect that maybe you
just wanted to sit with things.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.986
I need to learn to let people do that.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.656
I'll be better next time.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.532
I promise.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.076
Good night.

22:18.671 --> 22:19.713
Ruby.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.514
What is that?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.266
I know, it's too much.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.600
I'm taking it down.

22:32.810 --> 22:33.993
I just thought it would've been nice

22:33.994 --> 22:36.272
to add a bit of your
hometown to the party.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.441
It was to take pictures in front of.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.026
Oh, my God, this is...

22:41.986 --> 22:44.446
You know not everyone
wears cowboy boots in Texas.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.282
I took liberties.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.285
Are those little Frito pies?

22:49.952 --> 22:50.952
Yes.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.622
- It's amazing.
- Really?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.546
Wait, that's not even the
best part. Close your eyes.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.925
Now, imagine you're at the party

23:05.009 --> 23:07.636
and you stroll over
to take pictures and...

23:08.304 --> 23:09.388
Open your eyes.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.527
Is it freaking you out? I
mean, do they look too real?

23:25.112 --> 23:26.947
You printed cut-outs of my parents?

23:27.031 --> 23:29.408
I thought it'd be nice for
them to make an appearance.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.079
This is the best worst
shit I've ever seen.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.290
- Really?
- Yes, really.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.918
The quince is back on.

23:40.002 --> 23:43.130
Damn it. We lost half a day.
We're gonna have to double time it.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.554
Ruby's not crazy.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.974
The dude ordered a horse. A horse.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.476
What does Laura Diaz think?

23:57.645 --> 23:59.772
But seriously, did Laura
ever get a response?

24:00.397 --> 24:01.982
Her friend request was accepted.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.442
Holy shit!

24:03.525 --> 24:04.985
Well, what'd you find out?

24:05.069 --> 24:07.446
- I haven't started digging yet.
- Let's do it now!

24:08.322 --> 24:10.115
Mm, I don't know.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.190
I'm too nervous.

24:12.191 --> 24:15.120
Feels like something I should
do on my own in case I...

24:15.204 --> 24:16.372
In case what?

24:17.164 --> 24:18.999
I can't handle what I find.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.961
Okay. But you know I'm
here for you, right?

24:23.754 --> 24:24.922
I'm still your friend.

24:25.714 --> 24:26.714
I know.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.931
Oh, so get this. Remember how
I told you she's an author?

24:34.014 --> 24:35.617
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I read one of her books.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.726
And it's about a teenager
who travels back in time

24:37.810 --> 24:39.687
and her past self is trying to kill her.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.231
So, she's literally
running from her past.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.358
Yes! Thank you. Isn't that insane?

24:44.441 --> 24:47.444
- It all seems to be adding up.
- Or I'm just reading into it.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.579
- I can't do this.
- What?

24:58.664 --> 24:59.873
Pretend we're just friends.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.377
I can't stop thinking about you.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.588
- About us.
- Please don't, Cesar.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.632
- I can't help it.
- You're with Olivia.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.426
And the fam is happy.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.677
But I'm not.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.183
I think about you all the time.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.355
Do you ever think about me?

25:29.737 --> 25:30.863
All the time.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.665
Hey, yo.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.252
Hey, yo.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.881
Hey, what's good with you,
ma? You're looking good.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.259
Let me get that ass at Pimp Lane.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.596
Yo, Monse, why you still hanging
out with these broke-ass Santos?

25:55.679 --> 25:58.182
Oh, you spent time in juvie,
now you think you're balling?

25:58.265 --> 26:02.102
Yeah, where do you think I knocked
off a bunch of your punk ass homies?

26:02.186 --> 26:03.395
Ask about me. Go ahead.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.814
Hey! Hey! Let's just go!

26:05.898 --> 26:08.066
Screw the Santos and your dead homies.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.569
You know what side you on?
This is our block, feel me?

26:10.652 --> 26:12.863
They call me Lil' Spooky.
I'll blast on your ass.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.532
- Please, Cesar.
- I don't care what side I'm on.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.830
You're lucky your bitch is here.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.823
'Cause when I catch
you slippin' next time,

26:23.824 --> 26:25.460
I'm gonna put a hole in you.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.088
All potted and perky.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.216
Let's grub.

26:32.633 --> 26:36.220
Oh, no. Julio started eating without us.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.388
The food... it's all gone.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.182
That's not cool, homie.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.476
He's got that low blood sugar.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.261
That bitch ain't hypoglycemic!

26:45.854 --> 26:47.189
You know how I know? Huh?

26:47.272 --> 26:50.400
'Cause he's a stupid
inanimate object made in China!

26:50.943 --> 26:52.861
Or Malaysia. Or Jacksonville, Florida.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.404
I can't believe I fell for this.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.574
Your crazy ass has been
playing me this whole time.

26:57.658 --> 27:01.078
And you thought, "Oh... I bet
he can clean my entire place."

27:01.662 --> 27:02.704
Screw you!

27:04.248 --> 27:05.457
And screw Julio!

27:06.583 --> 27:09.253
Julio thinks it's actually
you who is playing me.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.922
You just want to know about the money.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.883
- Julio, did you just say that?
- He did.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.016
Oh, no. Put Julio down!

27:23.100 --> 27:24.852
He says he doesn't like
to be held that way.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.813
- He's got the vertigo.
- You tell Julio to shut his mouth!

27:27.896 --> 27:30.232
And then tell me what you
know about RollerWorld.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.026
- Tell me or Julio gets curbed.
- Put Julio down, please.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.130
Then talk.

27:34.131 --> 27:36.363
- Is there money buried in the neighborhood?
- Yes.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.132
- How do you know?
- Because I know who buried it.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.658
- Was it Ricky?
- Put down Julio.

27:39.741 --> 27:43.120
- Did Ricky bury the money?
- I don't know.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.539
Yes! Yes! Ricky buried the money.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.457
- How do you know?
- Because Ricky told me.

27:47.541 --> 27:48.584
Ricky never lied to me.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.980
- He protected me when nobody else would.
- So where's the money?

27:52.004 --> 27:54.506
With Julio. The key to the
money lies within Julio.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.342
Julio?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.511
- Within Julio?
- Yes!

27:59.595 --> 28:00.679
Screw Julio!

28:02.931 --> 28:04.057
Can Julio fly?

28:04.141 --> 28:05.267
What?

28:06.184 --> 28:07.603
- Let's find out.
- No!

28:32.628 --> 28:35.339
- Hey.
- Jamal, shit just got real.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.692
Latrelle rolled up on Cesar.
We have to get him out of town.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.468
It's the only way to keep him safe.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.511
And we need money, a
lot of money to do it.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.680
Do you really think  RollerWorld's real?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.354
I know it is.
