01:21.880 --> 01:24.599
Boy, what's the matter
with sitcoms these days?

01:24.840 --> 01:26.478
Where's the new Arnold the Pigs?

01:26.680 --> 01:28.033
The new Barney Fifes?

01:28.240 --> 01:30.356
Where's the Gradys
from Sanford and Son?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.229
Take this guy.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.035
All he's done for the last 20 minutes
is talk about which toothbrush is his.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.556
Yeah, like a real man
would use a toothbrush.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.997
See what else is on.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.833
Well, this looks good.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.112
This is the new Barnaby Jones
reunion show.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.835
Dad, that's the new
Rolling Stones video.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.196
That's not Buddy Ebsen,
that's Keith Richards.

01:58.440 --> 02:01.591
I thought he looked
a little old for Buddy Ebsen.

02:03.360 --> 02:06.158
The Home Shopping Network.
Boy, this is a good idea for women.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.550
It was a little too tough
driving to the mall...

02:08.759 --> 02:10.591
...with a couch strapped to their ass.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.237
Which reminds me,
Peggy's still in Wanker County, right?

02:19.480 --> 02:20.629
Yep, but not for long.

02:20.840 --> 02:24.753
Not since the doctor put her mom
on a no-salt-lick diet.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.109
She should be back on all fours
any minute now.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.030
That's good.
Oh, look, white-trash collector plates.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.959
I'm glad Peg's not here to see this.

02:37.160 --> 02:41.278
Our first call is from Wank er County,
Wisconsin.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.229
Yes. I'd lik e to order the Roger Clinton
service for eight, please.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.035
Now, that comes
with matching spittoons, right?

02:51.280 --> 02:54.238
It's amazing. They don't even
have gravity in Wanker County...

02:54.440 --> 02:56.908
...but they get
the Home Shopping Network.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.433
Yes, and I'd also lik e
the Gillooly soup tureens.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.788
Now available,
original tapes of the British TV series...

03:11.000 --> 03:13.275
...The Avengers.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.833
That butt.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.474
I'd know that butt anywhere.
That's Emma Peel.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.478
Those are... Those are Peel cheeks.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.639
Peel. Peel. Peel.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.479
Emma Peel's the one
that wore the really tight jumpsuits.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.312
And kicked really high.

03:28.560 --> 03:33.509
Thereby allowing us to see every
single nuance and fold in her body.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.797
- Jefferson, I've gotta order this.
- To the phones.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.991
Has it occurred
to either of you rutabagas...

03:40.200 --> 03:42.475
...that the woman
may be pushing 200 by now?

03:42.720 --> 03:44.756
Pounds and years.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.832
That's why you look at them on tape.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.635
If I only had to look at your mother
on tape, I'd still be having sex with her.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.392
Hey, Daddy.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.116
- Can I have $200?
- No, you can't, pumpkin.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.436
We have to save everything
for the essentials.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.914
You know, food, clothing...

04:00.160 --> 04:03.675
Hello? Yes, I'd like to order
the new Emma Peel tape, please.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.031
And do you have one
where she kicks really high?

04:08.240 --> 04:09.434
Bud?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.153
Do I look like I'm made of money?

04:11.680 --> 04:15.309
Well, just that roll of dimes
you keep in your pants.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.680
Those are quarters. I mean...

04:22.280 --> 04:24.555
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.672
Please, it's only $200.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.112
Kelly, I work at the Department
of Vehicle Services.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.596
How much money do you think I make
riding around in a car all day?

04:33.800 --> 04:34.994
And remember...

04:35.200 --> 04:37.589
...I'm upright and in the front seat.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.438
Please? I need it to help me
get a beer commercial.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.910
- Budweiser?
- No. Ice Hole.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.756
- Just asking, slut.
- No. No.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.758
Ice Hole is the name of the beer.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.231
It's one of those
new microbrewery beers.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.113
They're having auditions
for spokesmodels in a couple days.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.197
This could be
the biggest thing in my life.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.994
And before you know it,
I'll be living it up in Hollywood.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.714
Getting in slap fights
with Shannen Doherty...

05:11.920 --> 05:14.957
...and having my ass grabbed
by Bob Barker.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.949
Yeah, yeah, do you have one
where she's soaking wet?

05:22.040 --> 05:25.953
Or one where she's freezing,
freezing cold?

05:27.240 --> 05:30.835
Why, yes, I do sell women's shoes.
How did you know that?

05:32.960 --> 05:37.192
Listen. The pictures are only $300
and I only have $100.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.675
- You have a hundred bucks?
- Yes.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.353
I know where you might
get your pictures done for 100 bucks.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.309
Yeah, me too,
but I don't wanna be in Jugs Magazine.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.433
Okay. Okay.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.437
I know another place.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.790
You know, I just might be able
to help you out.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.029
Well, okay.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.949
But remember, these have to be the
kind of pictures that bring out my best.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.710
And smile.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.669
Beautiful. I love it. Turn, turn.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.992
Beautiful.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.274
Very sexy. Very beautiful.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.038
Oh, yeah.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.234
Bud.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.919
Bud.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.759
You know what today is?

06:26.520 --> 06:28.988
National blue shirt
and brown pants day?

06:30.240 --> 06:31.753
Really?

06:34.360 --> 06:36.157
That's not gonna affect the mail, is it?

06:36.360 --> 06:38.874
Because I'm expecting
my Emma Peel tape today.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.870
Did I tell you
she could kick really, really high?

06:44.080 --> 06:45.593
Daddy.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.637
Daddy, I got the commercial!

06:49.840 --> 06:52.070
I'm the new Ice Hole girl.
Isn't that exciting?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.959
It sure is. Sweetheart,
did you see the mailman out there?

06:55.760 --> 06:58.513
This could be my big break.
Aren't you even gonna be excited?

06:58.760 --> 07:01.035
Honey, yes, I'm excited for you,
but you know me...

07:01.240 --> 07:03.959
...I don't get all gushy
and emotional.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.515
The tape's here.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.270
Give me that! Give me!

07:15.280 --> 07:18.352
Wait a second, Jefferson.
This isn't an Emma Peel Avengers.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.518
This is a Linda "We-Couldn't-
Get-Anybody-Else-to-Do-the-Show"...

07:21.720 --> 07:22.789
...Thorson Avengers.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.158
Jefferson, we've been hornswoggled.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.715
To the phones.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.596
You know, Kel, it's a wonder
we turned out as well as we did.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.394
Well, I guess it's just me
and Buck now.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.278
If I could call a cab,
it would just be you.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.230
Well, listen here, you carpetbaggers.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.874
It's been over two weeks
and I'm still without Peel.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.150
Now, I'm going to whoever
regulates you people.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.237
Who is that anyway?

08:03.440 --> 08:06.830
"Absolutely no one."

08:08.840 --> 08:10.876
What is their number?

08:11.280 --> 08:15.114
"1-800-Bite-Me."

08:16.560 --> 08:18.118
Gotcha.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.509
Daddy, I'm ruined.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.792
My life is even more worthless
than yours.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.155
Well, how could that possibly be?

08:28.360 --> 08:30.032
Well, what about the commercial?

08:30.240 --> 08:33.073
- There's not gonna be a commercial.
- Why?

08:33.320 --> 08:35.754
I've got a zit.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.958
Look at it, Daddy.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.033
It's the size of the Earth itself.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.196
This is the first zit
I've had in my life...

08:56.400 --> 08:58.595
...and the commercial's
the day after tomorrow.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.997
Don't worry, Kelly.
You can hardly see it.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.953
- You mean it?
- Yes, pumpkin. Trust me.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.799
- No one will ever notice it.
- Okay.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.034
Whoa, look at the size of that zit!

09:18.880 --> 09:19.995
Before that baby blows...

09:20.200 --> 09:23.078
...better warn the villagers
living at the base of your feet.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.353
Bud, don't you see
that your sister's in pain?

09:27.560 --> 09:29.198
Try to be a little more sensitive.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.631
Sweetheart, that thing's not gonna leak
all over Daddy's shirt, is it?

09:32.840 --> 09:36.116
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.991
I probably got this from you,
you know.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.838
What else am I gonna get from you?

09:44.040 --> 09:47.157
What, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow
and my bed's gonna be wet...

09:47.360 --> 09:50.079
...and I can't find
my jammie bottoms?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.159
If you really wanna go on TV...

09:54.360 --> 09:58.672
...you could draw a little face on your zit
and go on Montel as Siamese twins.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.515
Al?

10:01.720 --> 10:04.871
Jefferson, can't you see that I'm trying
to comfort my daughter here?

10:05.120 --> 10:08.954
- It's about Emma Peel.
- Excuse me, pumpkin.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.475
What's up?

10:11.680 --> 10:14.592
They admitted that they don't have
an Avengers with Emma Peel...

10:14.800 --> 10:16.392
...but they did offer a substitute.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.437
No. No deal.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.359
- It's Peel or nothing.
- It's The Three Stooges.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.395
Oh, happy day.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.598
Pick two.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.193
Well, you're obviously
in good hands here.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.992
I'm gonna go
and start my homework...

10:49.200 --> 10:52.510
...before they start grabbing
each other's noses with pliers.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.158
Too late.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.351
- Aren't you gonna answer that?
- No.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.189
- I was happy, that means it's Peg.
- Well, you don't know that.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.875
Hello? It's Mom.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.717
Hi, Mom, I'm so glad you called.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.512
How's everything going, honey?

11:15.720 --> 11:18.075
It's terrible. I've got a huge pimple.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.829
An actual Bud Bundy growing
from my forehead.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.513
Well, you know, Uncle Sticky's
getting out of the pen today.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.837
You want him to make you up
a batch of his pimple potion?

11:30.200 --> 11:34.398
I thought Uncle Sticky's potion
is what got him sent to prison.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.235
It did. But I thought
you were desperate.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.835
No, no, no. I am, I am.
How soon can you get it here?

11:40.080 --> 11:41.195
Tomorrow.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.393
Cousin Zimo is running a truckload
of illegal fireworks to Peoria.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.398
- I'll have him drop it off in the morning.
- Cool.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.830
- You wanna talk to Grandma?
- Sure.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.673
Hey, Dad.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.834
Dad.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.156
Mom's gonna send me some
homemade pimple stuff.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.834
From Uncle Sticky, sweetheart?

12:01.040 --> 12:03.031
You remember Uncle Sticky's face,
honey?

12:03.280 --> 12:05.748
It's where we used to keep our keys.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.072
Pumpkin, I'm afraid you're gonna have
to not do this commercial.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.477
- Yeah, how much would you be losing?
- Two thousand dollars.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.995
You will do this commercial
if it kills you.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.919
Remember, nothing good
ever came out of Wanker County...

12:19.120 --> 12:20.235
...including your mother.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.557
So, now, here. Listen.
This is all the money that I've got.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.911
Go to a pharmacy
and get some real medicine.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.479
Outside?

12:28.680 --> 12:30.636
But, Dad,
what if somebody sees my pimple?

12:30.880 --> 12:33.440
Pumpkin, it's dark.
No one's gonna see the pimple.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.392
I guess you're right.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.956
I guess I'm just being, silly, huh?

12:39.160 --> 12:42.835
Whoa, look at the zits
on the blond chick.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.679
Thank God he didn't see the pimple,
huh?

12:54.080 --> 12:58.676
Two grand and The Three Stooges.
For a dead man, I'm awfully happy.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.359
You know my women's group and I
are going to protest.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.875
What? The Stooges?

13:06.680 --> 13:10.116
If you don't like them, how come you
keep getting your hair cut like Moe?

13:14.560 --> 13:17.518
Not that, you primordial ooze.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.759
It has come to my attention
that Kelly is the new Ice Hole Beer girl.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.714
Now, you have done
some low things before...

13:25.920 --> 13:29.469
...but to allow your own daughter
to flaunt her body to sell beer...

13:29.680 --> 13:31.557
...that's low even for you.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.354
Jefferson.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.474
She's right, Al.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.073
Marcie, let me explain
something to you:

13:48.400 --> 13:50.550
Oh, that's very funny.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.916
She's right, Al.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.712
But unlike evolution,
I am not letting you off the hook, Al.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.713
Now, can you please tell me...

14:02.920 --> 14:05.798
...what a woman's body
has to do with selling beer?

14:06.520 --> 14:08.795
All right. Number one...

14:09.000 --> 14:10.353
...if it wasn't for beer...

14:10.560 --> 14:14.030
...there'd be at least three people who
probably wouldn't even be married.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.393
Me...

14:17.960 --> 14:19.393
...Jefferson...

14:21.600 --> 14:24.797
...and probably Lisa Marie Presley.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.795
And number two...

14:33.000 --> 14:34.399
...since men buy beer...

14:34.600 --> 14:37.398
...advertisers have to cater
to what we want, and...

14:37.600 --> 14:40.114
Hold on to your corncob pipe.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.550
- We like pretty women.

14:42.760 --> 14:48.437
Ergo, pretty women sell good products,
ugly women sell... tennis rackets.

14:49.320 --> 14:53.438
Pretty women, cars.
Ugly women, mini vans.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.232
Pretty women make us buy beer...

14:55.440 --> 14:58.671
...ugly women make us drink beer.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.952
And if you were any more of a pig...

15:08.160 --> 15:10.958
...kids would be putting coins
in your back.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.953
Now, I promise you,
this will not go unanswered.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.470
My women's group and I
will be on the Ice Hole set to protest.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.111
Will they be wearing dainty little
overalls and matching caterpillar caps?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.114
Some will.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.436
Will you be wearing
your usual foot odour...

15:27.640 --> 15:29.995
...with matching aura of failure?

15:32.720 --> 15:34.278
Pick two.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.711
One, two.

15:38.720 --> 15:42.713
Jefferson, you don't think I'm wrong
for having Kelly do this, do you?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.629
Well, Al, she'll probably be parading
around half-naked...

15:46.840 --> 15:51.311
...to sell cheap beer to a bunch
of leering, screaming yahoos.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.593
You know, you're right, buddy,
it's a tough call.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.359
You wanna go to the nudie bar
and think about it?

16:01.120 --> 16:02.599
Okay.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.589
Well, there's only
one thing left to do.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.715
Remember...

16:53.920 --> 16:57.833
...nothing good
ever came out of Wank er County.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.635
Yeah, but how often are you right?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.637
Good point.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.237
U se our minds, not behinds
U se our minds, not behinds

17:24.680 --> 17:28.958
U se our minds, not behinds
U se our minds, not behinds

17:29.440 --> 17:32.079
Well, let me see.
What part are you gonna be playing?

17:32.280 --> 17:36.034
Handsome romantic lead or Eskimo?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.438
Take a guess.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.676
Welcome aboard, Nanuk.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.200
- Let's see, where's that...?
- Hi, there.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.471
You're not here for the handsome
romantic lead, are you?

17:49.720 --> 17:51.711
I don't play that at home.

17:52.680 --> 17:56.195
Look, we're running late here.
Has anybody seen the Bundy babe?

17:56.400 --> 17:57.992
Women are not babes.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.352
I thought we nixed the sea lions
for this commercial.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.913
We heard that.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.119
Listen, don't mind them.
I keyed their pickups on the way in.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.551
I'm Al. I'm Kelly's father.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.991
She had a blemish.
It made her a little nervous.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.549
And against her father's wishes...

18:17.760 --> 18:19.716
...she used some stuff
that was cooked up...

18:19.920 --> 18:23.833
...by my idiot wife's idiot relatives and,
well, there were some mild side effects.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.316
Nothing that can't be solved
with creative lighting, but...

18:27.520 --> 18:30.592
Well, you guys are the experts,
so why don't you tell me.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.074
Pumpkin.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.110
Well, that was a short day.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.433
This is our spokesmodel? This?

18:56.640 --> 19:00.474
We're selling beer here, fella,
not Lucky Charms.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.399
I need someone gorgeous
to sell this crap.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.794
Thank you.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.314
This should be a slam-dunk...

19:06.520 --> 19:09.193
...multi-million-dollar
discrimination lawsuit.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.312
- Discrimination suit?
- Yes. I am Marcie D'Arcy...

19:12.520 --> 19:15.796
...here on behalf of the Coalition
for the Aesthetically Challenged.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.439
"Challenged"?

19:17.640 --> 19:21.394
I'd say, " Defeated, exiled
and left for dead."

19:24.840 --> 19:26.956
You mind repeating that?

19:28.320 --> 19:30.197
As a matter of fact...

19:30.400 --> 19:32.356
...I do.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.992
Anyway, you will use Kelly
in this commercial, as she is...

19:38.200 --> 19:42.159
...or we will slap the biggest lawsuit
on you that you have ever had.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.800
Could they possibly do that?
Sue on behalf of the ugly?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.797
How can they win that?

19:48.040 --> 19:49.519
Four words:

19:49.720 --> 19:53.793
Attorney General Janet Reno.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.117
When your wife looks lik e this...

20:02.320 --> 20:05.790
...you might as well dive
into an Ice Hole.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.679
Ice Hole Beer.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.316
When it's 2 a.m.
And you gotta do something.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.519
Coming up next on
Business Week In Review:

20:15.720 --> 20:19.872
The mark eting geniuses behind
the successful media campaign...

20:20.080 --> 20:22.310
...for Ice Hole Beer.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.156
I'm finally on my way
to fame and fortune.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.875
When this beer takes off nationally
and takes Kelly with it, I'll be rich.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.317
Oh, you mean we'll be rich?

20:31.520 --> 20:33.476
Yeah. Yeah. We'll be rich.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.598
Me and Kelly.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.233
For once... And I'm not afraid to say it.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.510
- AI Bundy can't lose.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.510
Well, I was fired.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.071
- Can't win, either.
- What happened?

20:48.640 --> 20:51.677
Well, once my hair grew back
and the beard fell off...

20:51.880 --> 20:54.633
...they said I was too pretty
to be doing beer commercials.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.195
Advertisers are so afraid
of good-Iooking people...

20:57.400 --> 20:59.550
...that the producers
won't even touch me.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.149
Well, they'll touch me,
they just won't hire me.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.118
Dad.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.032
What are we gonna do
about the money?

21:06.280 --> 21:08.316
Well, don't worry,
we'll just ugly her up.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.353
Call Uncle Sticky, tell him
we need something more permanent.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.956
Sweetheart,
don't worry about a thing.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.116
When we get done
with your face this time...

21:16.320 --> 21:18.834
...you'll be giving warthogs dry heaves.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.869
Oh, that's so sweet, Daddy.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.958
But it's too late. They already
hired my ugly replacement.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.549
Already? Who?

21:29.120 --> 21:32.078
See for yourself.
Here's the commercial.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.793
Hello. Remember me?

21:40.360 --> 21:43.272
Oh, my God, she's a hundred.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.477
And she's still kicking high.
