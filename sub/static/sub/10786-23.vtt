It's beautiful.

00:46.166 --> 00:47.333
How could I refuse?

changing either of our lives

01:02.667 --> 01:04.417
My point exactly.
Yeah.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.750
So, you know what, I have to go.
I have something borrowed,

11:14.667 --> 11:17.166
I haven't finished my
best man speech yet.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.250
Any thoughts?

11:19.625 --> 11:21.083
Oh. I don't
have much to say

11:21.083 --> 11:23.417
about relationships
these days, Dawson.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.875
If you have someplace
else you'd rather be,

11:26.875 --> 11:28.083
why don't you just go?

11:28.625 --> 11:30.291
What are you
talking about?

11:31.041 --> 11:32.667
Do I have to
spell it out for you?

11:32.667 --> 11:34.041
Pacey's
going-away party.

11:36.375 --> 11:37.875
I'm here, aren't I?

11:39.208 --> 11:40.708
Yeah, in body,
but not in spirit.

11:40.708 --> 11:43.291
Joey, you've got nothing
positive to say.

11:43.291 --> 11:44.959
You're basically going
through the motions

11:44.959 --> 11:46.208
with a scowl
on your face.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.166
Dawson, I'm doing
the best I can.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.458
Can you cut me some slack?

11:49.458 --> 11:52.208
Cut me some slack, Joey.
Don't make me feel like this!

11:52.208 --> 11:53.083
Like what?

11:53.083 --> 11:54.250
Like you're
stuck with me!

11:54.708 --> 11:56.333
Alright? I don't
deserve that.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.166
You're right. I--

12:00.166 --> 12:01.917
You don't. I'm--

12:04.458 --> 12:05.834
I'm sorry.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.583
Well, why
don't you just go?

12:11.708 --> 12:13.000
All right?
give the guy my best.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.333
I'm staying.

12:26.708 --> 12:27.750
GRAMS: Oh, look!

12:28.291 --> 12:29.333
Star light, star bright,

12:29.333 --> 12:31.625
first star I see tonight.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.875
Ok, who wants
to make the first wish?

12:33.875 --> 12:35.166
Oh, my god-- ow!

12:35.166 --> 12:37.750
Ow. That's a piece
of a crab shell.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.291
Chipped my tooth.
Great. Great.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.166
Just what I need to keep men
permanently away from me.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.458
ANDIE: Well, if that
doesn't work,

12:43.458 --> 12:45.208
you can always join me
this summer in the nunnery!

12:45.667 --> 12:47.750
At least you get to have
relationships before they fail.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.583
GRAMS: Good grief, you all sound
like a bunch of old ladies.

12:51.959 --> 12:53.917
Grams, it's been a tough
couple of months.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.917
You don't know
what tough is.

12:56.250 --> 12:59.000
No offense, Grams, but you have
no idea what our lives are like.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.083
What, you think I've
never been in love before?

13:01.417 --> 13:04.625
Yeah, once. With one man
your whole entire life.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.792
You know, when I was...

13:08.083 --> 13:10.125
Just a few years
older than you,

13:11.166 --> 13:13.375
I was working at Brunswick
Naval Hospital,

13:13.375 --> 13:14.708
and I met a boy

13:14.708 --> 13:19.708
who had the most beautiful
blue eyes I have ever seen.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.875
He was leaving for
Busan in the morning,

13:23.208 --> 13:27.500
but we had an entire
glorious day on the beach,

13:28.291 --> 13:29.917
and at the end of that day,

13:30.291 --> 13:33.542
he leaned in close to me
and whispered,

13:34.750 --> 13:36.166
"Will you wait for me?"

13:37.250 --> 13:38.667
So...what'd
you do?

13:38.667 --> 13:39.667
I froze.

13:39.667 --> 13:43.291
I knew if I leaned just
two inches closer,

13:43.625 --> 13:47.208
the world as I knew it
would be changed forever.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.125
So you did
nothing?

13:50.291 --> 13:51.583
You didn't
kiss him,

13:51.583 --> 13:52.959
you didn't try
to speak to him.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.125
You just did
nothing.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.375
Nothing.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.917
Did you ever wonder
what your life

13:57.917 --> 14:00.417
might have been like
if you had kissed him?

14:00.417 --> 14:03.959
That is just the point.
I don't have to wonder.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.166
The very next day,
I got my best friend Sally

14:07.166 --> 14:08.291
to cover the shift for me.

14:08.708 --> 14:11.834
And after seven turbulent hours
in the cargo hold

14:11.834 --> 14:13.417
of a C130...

14:14.291 --> 14:15.959
I arrived in San Diego,

14:15.959 --> 14:17.208
went straight to the dock,

14:17.208 --> 14:20.500
and in front of the entire crew
of the U.S.S. Missouri,

14:21.125 --> 14:22.291
I kissed him.

14:24.083 --> 14:27.000
That's funny, I had no idea
Gramps was in the Korean war.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.166
He wasn't.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.625
Thomas Culpepper...

14:32.417 --> 14:36.000
The boy with the most beautiful
blue eyes I've ever seen...

14:37.208 --> 14:38.250
Died in Busan...

14:39.792 --> 14:41.083
in shallow water

14:41.708 --> 14:44.250
before he ever
made it off the boat.

14:50.834 --> 14:53.750
Two years later,
I married your grandfather.

14:54.542 --> 14:58.834
So I have had forty six
wonderful years with one man

14:58.834 --> 15:01.667
and one perfect kiss

15:01.667 --> 15:02.792
with another.

15:02.792 --> 15:05.250
And I have no regrets.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.125
GRAMS: Wonder how many of
you will be able to say that

15:08.125 --> 15:09.125
about your lives?

15:15.125 --> 15:16.083
Have you seen Dad?

15:16.083 --> 15:17.375
No. have you seen Joey?

15:17.375 --> 15:18.792
Uh, no.

15:40.834 --> 15:41.750
Bessie called.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.125
She said she wants you to stop
by the store on your way home.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.125
Thanks.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.291
Sure.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.000
Joey, about this afternoon...

15:54.917 --> 15:56.000
I don't want to fight.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.250
That's the last thing
I want to do.

15:58.250 --> 16:01.542
I know, I don't-- I don't want
to fight either, Dawson.

16:03.458 --> 16:04.500
I'm sorry.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.792
If we're gonna have an
honest relationship, Dawson,

16:14.792 --> 16:19.750
then there's...
Something you should know.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.625
I broke things off
with Pacey,

16:24.125 --> 16:27.458
not entirely, but in
large part because...

16:29.667 --> 16:31.166
I didn't want
to lose you.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.083
I may have lived
across the creek,

16:35.083 --> 16:37.125
but it was only when I was
rowing in this direction

16:37.125 --> 16:39.500
that I actually felt like
I was rowing home.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.083
You're so much of my life,
Dawson. I mean...

16:44.500 --> 16:47.333
Your house is my house
and your family is my family,

16:47.333 --> 16:49.166
and there's not a single
significant event

16:49.166 --> 16:51.625
I've experienced that you
haven't experienced with me,

16:51.625 --> 16:54.875
and I was so afraid
of losing that.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.542
But... if that
wasn't the choice,

16:59.917 --> 17:01.583
and if I thought
that there was a chance

17:01.583 --> 17:03.250
that you would forgive me...

17:07.416 --> 17:09.208
I may have chosen
differently.

17:12.541 --> 17:14.583
And you deserve
to know that.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.791
GRAMS: Jennifer?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.541
What's wrong?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.375
I wish that I hadn't
let Henry go

17:25.375 --> 17:27.416
without telling him
how I really feel.

17:27.416 --> 17:30.625
I wish...
now it's too late.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.500
It's never too late.

17:32.959 --> 17:34.000
Yeah, I suppose.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.458
Here's
what I suppose.

17:35.458 --> 17:36.834
[CAR SCREECHING]

17:36.834 --> 17:38.041
JEN: What on earth
are you doing?!

17:38.041 --> 17:39.375
GRAMS: We are gonna
catch that bus,

17:39.375 --> 17:42.917
and you're gonna tell
that boy exactly how you feel.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.917
What took you
so long?

18:10.375 --> 18:11.583
I got thirsty.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.625
I called Bessie,
Bessie called you.

18:15.125 --> 18:17.667
I tell you, it is not easy work
finishing things off.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.000
Pacey, what
does this mean?

18:23.083 --> 18:24.583
Well, it means
you were right.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.291
That my leaving would be
giving up on you.

18:27.625 --> 18:30.083
And I'm not quite prepared
to do that just yet.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.959
But it also means
that I need to know

18:32.959 --> 18:35.708
that you're not quite prepared
to give up on me yet either.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.250
So, all that
being said,

18:39.250 --> 18:42.083
I refer to the wall
with its...

18:42.083 --> 18:44.417
hastily yet adoringly
written S.O.S.,

18:44.417 --> 18:46.750
which I guess kinda
speaks for itself.

18:52.625 --> 18:54.166
I spent an hour
and a half

18:54.834 --> 18:56.083
staring at this
half-painted wall

18:56.083 --> 18:57.708
after we talked
last night...

18:58.834 --> 19:00.792
Just staring
and thinking.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.667
So, the way
I figure it...

19:03.333 --> 19:04.959
It's your turn
to stare now.

19:32.834 --> 19:36.333
I do promise
to love you...

19:37.083 --> 19:39.166
in good times
and in bad,

19:39.667 --> 19:42.000
in sickness
and in health.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.959
I loved you
before I knew you.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.667
I will love you
for all eternity,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.500
for you are
my beloved, Mitch.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.792
You're my best friend.

19:59.417 --> 20:02.333
I loved you
before I knew you,

20:02.959 --> 20:05.291
and I will love you
for eternity,

20:07.041 --> 20:08.875
for you are my beloved.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.875
You're my best friend.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.708
And now by the power
vested in me,

20:15.959 --> 20:20.041
I'm happy to pronounce you
husband and wife...

20:20.041 --> 20:21.291
Again.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.750
Mitch, you may
kiss the bride.

21:15.417 --> 21:18.875
ANDIE: Grams, we've been
driving for hours!

21:19.125 --> 21:20.792
His bus could be
anywhere by now.

21:20.792 --> 21:22.750
Yeah. We could
have missed him.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.500
You can't miss
a giant gray bus

21:24.500 --> 21:26.708
filled with high school
football players.

21:26.708 --> 21:28.792
GRAMS: Like that one
right there.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.041
JEN: Where?

21:30.542 --> 21:31.917
Oh, my god.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.417
-ANDIE: Whoo!
-Okay.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.458
ANDIE: Jen! Oh, my god!

JEN: Ohh...

21:37.750 --> 21:38.792
Okay!

21:40.041 --> 21:41.041
Henry?

21:41.667 --> 21:43.333
Um...Henry?

21:43.625 --> 21:45.792
Henry...Parker?

21:48.083 --> 21:49.458
Hey-- Henry!

21:49.792 --> 21:51.041
Henry Parker!

21:51.041 --> 21:52.792
Out of my way!
Come on.

21:52.792 --> 21:54.458
Henry, you in there?

21:54.458 --> 21:55.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

21:55.875 --> 21:57.917
You can't go in there. What,
have you lost your mind?

21:57.917 --> 22:00.625
Well, quite possibly, yes,
I might have lost it.

22:09.583 --> 22:10.625
Henry...

22:10.625 --> 22:12.834
Nine months ago,
you paid $500 to kiss me,

22:12.834 --> 22:14.625
and I was too dumb to
realize what that meant

22:14.625 --> 22:17.625
and what you were really
offering me, but I know now.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.333
It means that there really is
such a thing as a second chance

22:20.333 --> 22:22.417
and that no matter how old
or how jaded you are,

22:22.417 --> 22:24.208
when you meet the person
you're supposed to be with,

22:24.208 --> 22:25.500
everything's gonna be new.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.959
A sunset, a cheesy love song,
and especially sex.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.834
BOYS: Whoo!

22:31.834 --> 22:34.625
Henry, I'm the reason we
didn't have sex after prom.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.041
Trust me, I know.

22:36.041 --> 22:37.208
Not because
I was mad at you

22:37.208 --> 22:39.208
but because I was more
nervous than you were.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.417
I have been with guys before,

22:40.417 --> 22:42.500
but I have never been with
anybody that I loved,

22:42.500 --> 22:46.375
and in that way, I'm more of
a virgin than you could ever be.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.750

22:49.792 --> 22:50.834

23:19.250 --> 23:20.875
Look, I can't
do it, Pacey.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.375
I can't give you
a reason to stay.

23:24.375 --> 23:26.125
I have so much junk
to work through,

23:26.125 --> 23:27.959
I don't even know where
to begin the process it all.

23:27.959 --> 23:30.750
I mean, how I feel about you and
how I feel about Dawson--

23:31.000 --> 23:32.375
Then you've
made your choice.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.708
Right there. You've
made your choice.

23:34.708 --> 23:35.583
Good for you.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.041
I guess I have.

23:46.041 --> 23:46.583
Yeah.

23:49.375 --> 23:50.542
Wasn't so hard,
was it?

23:52.125 --> 23:53.792
Should have made it
months ago.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.041
Saved us all a lot
of time and energy.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.125
And heartache.

24:08.458 --> 24:09.834
I see all the members
of the triangle

24:09.834 --> 24:11.417
are present
and accounted for.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.875
Um, can I have
this camera?

24:13.417 --> 24:15.041
I'm gonna go take
some pictures.

24:16.750 --> 24:17.458

24:18.417 --> 24:18.959
Yep?

24:19.500 --> 24:20.959
Don't I even
get a good-bye?

24:27.333 --> 24:28.417
Good-bye, Pacey.

Just wondering,

24:39.917 --> 24:42.041

are you doing here?

24:42.458 --> 24:43.625

for the wedding.

24:46.583 --> 24:49.208
Last I heard, you were
sailing the Seven Seas.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.417
As indeed I am.

24:51.417 --> 24:52.291
Tomorrow.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.917
Today I'm here
for your parents.

24:54.917 --> 24:57.166
I'll be sure to pass on
your congratulations.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.667
Yeah, speaking of
congratulations...

25:04.667 --> 25:08.250
I guess I should be passing
some on to you.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.500
What are you
talking about?

25:11.667 --> 25:13.250
Well, she made
her choice, Dawson.

25:14.917 --> 25:15.667
You're it.

25:17.959 --> 25:19.834
You got what you wanted.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.542
Things are never gonna be
the same between us, are they?

25:36.583 --> 25:37.125
No.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.542
Yeah.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.583
Yeah, I didn't
think so.

25:46.375 --> 25:47.125
Yeah.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.083
I'll write you
every day!

25:50.083 --> 25:51.792
Just come back
in one piece!

25:51.792 --> 25:53.125
BOYS: Whoo!

25:55.041 --> 25:56.250
[LAUGHS]

25:56.250 --> 25:57.875
ANDIE: That was
awesome!

25:57.875 --> 25:59.583
You know you gotta resign
from the bitter club now.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.166
Oh, I'll still
be there in spirit.

26:01.166 --> 26:03.208
Oh, I am so proud of you.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.959
You showed great,
great courage today.

26:06.458 --> 26:07.792
How does it feel?

26:08.625 --> 26:10.208
Well, I feel like an idiot.

26:10.208 --> 26:11.625
A happy idiot.

26:11.625 --> 26:12.875
Did she say happy?

26:12.875 --> 26:14.208
You don't know how long
I've waited

26:14.208 --> 26:15.583
to hear you say that word.

26:15.583 --> 26:16.583
Yeah, you and me both.

26:16.583 --> 26:18.125
Been waiting a
long time to feel it.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.417
Ok! Ok, enough
hugging for today.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.041
You know, I think that we've
still got one thing left to do

26:26.041 --> 26:28.166
on our "carpe diem" road trip.

26:29.625 --> 26:30.750
Jack, it's your turn.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.750
JACK: No. [LAUGHS] No.

26:33.750 --> 26:34.667
No way.

26:34.667 --> 26:37.000
JEN: Our era of regret
ends right now.

26:37.250 --> 26:38.792
What's the fastest
route to Boston?

26:45.250 --> 26:46.834
You know, I used to be
able to look in your eyes

26:46.834 --> 26:48.500
and know everything
you were thinking.

26:52.041 --> 26:53.000
These days...

26:54.250 --> 26:55.792
I haven't a clue.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.875
I was just thinking
about the summer...

27:04.583 --> 27:06.542
How much there's
gonna be to do,

27:07.166 --> 27:08.375
I mean, we didn't get a chance

27:08.375 --> 27:10.375
to spend last summer
together, you and I.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.083
We're gonna have a lot
to catch up on.

27:13.083 --> 27:17.000
There'll be waterskiing
with your dad, and, um...

27:17.458 --> 27:19.708
Fourth of July
on Waldeck Island and...

27:20.166 --> 27:22.542
we can even go into
Boston for the weekend.

27:24.792 --> 27:26.083
That'll be fun.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.458
Yeah.

27:32.458 --> 27:33.083
Yeah.

27:34.333 --> 27:34.917
Yeah.

27:52.333 --> 27:53.083
Wish me luck.

28:09.166 --> 28:10.375
-Jack!
-Hey.

28:10.375 --> 28:11.333
-Hey.

28:11.667 --> 28:14.000
Uh...what are you
doing here?

28:14.667 --> 28:16.500
I-- I just drove
a really long way

28:16.500 --> 28:19.000
to tell you,
um...

28:20.625 --> 28:22.875
More sort of to try
and explain, really.

28:24.208 --> 28:25.959
No, I-- I don't
mean that. Uh...

28:26.750 --> 28:28.166
I wanna show you...

28:28.458 --> 28:30.625
Yeah, I wanna
show you that I can

28:30.625 --> 28:32.959
and that I'm not
afraid to...

28:34.375 --> 28:36.417
Oh, hell, This.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.667
Uh...Jack...

28:40.959 --> 28:42.166
No. Uh...

28:42.166 --> 28:43.792
I know there's
people around,

28:43.792 --> 28:45.000
but who cares,
right?

28:45.000 --> 28:46.041
I mean, that's
the whole point.

28:46.041 --> 28:47.625
I finally have the
courage to do this.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.500
Jack, this is Brad.

28:55.291 --> 28:56.875
As in your ex-boyfriend Brad?

28:57.333 --> 28:58.750
Uh...no.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.542
As in his boyfriend Brad.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.333
BRAD: I think I'm gonna let
you two talk this one out.

29:05.500 --> 29:06.625
BRAD: See you at practice.

29:06.625 --> 29:07.542
Ok.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.208
[EXHALES]

29:13.625 --> 29:16.041
-ETHAN: Wow. um...
-JACK: [LAUGHS]

29:17.083 --> 29:19.000
Okay, explanation time.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.333
No. No explanations necessary.

29:21.917 --> 29:24.250
It's very clear to me that
I just inducted myself

29:24.250 --> 29:25.792
into the halls of the
permanently pathetic.

29:25.792 --> 29:29.000
ETHAN: Please, Jack,
just listen.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.750
The timing just
isn't there right now.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.458
And Brad and I--

29:35.708 --> 29:37.250
Yeah, I really don't want to
hear about the details

29:37.250 --> 29:39.875
of your joyful reunion
right now, okay?

29:45.708 --> 29:46.917
Sure, Jack.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.417
I'm sorry.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.041
I really am.

30:09.917 --> 30:12.625
The first time my parents got
married, they were very young.

30:12.625 --> 30:13.875
They were just
out of college.

30:14.583 --> 30:18.500
And, um, I remember looking
at the photo album as a kid,

30:18.500 --> 30:20.083
wondering why I wasn't
in any of the pictures.

30:20.333 --> 30:22.083
It's hard when you love
someone that much

30:22.083 --> 30:23.250
to imagine
them having this,

30:23.250 --> 30:26.208
entire life that you
weren't even there for.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.500
And I have to say
that, uh...

30:29.291 --> 30:31.542
Being here today,
experiencing this firsthand,

30:32.291 --> 30:34.250
finally getting to be
in all the pictures,

30:35.250 --> 30:36.667
I wouldn't trade this
for anything.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.542
'cause I'd much rather be a part
of what you guys have now

30:39.542 --> 30:40.750
than what you had then,

30:42.208 --> 30:44.291
that point where
everything is forgiven.

30:46.834 --> 30:48.834
And I think that's
what love really means...

30:50.166 --> 30:51.792
That you can
forgive anything.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.041
So...

30:56.834 --> 30:58.041
To my parents...

30:59.375 --> 31:01.917
Who taught me that love
does not conquer all...

31:02.333 --> 31:04.083
That love ends...

31:04.875 --> 31:06.417
And begins again.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.333
GUESTS: Hear, hear.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.542
Cheers.

31:27.708 --> 31:28.708
Hey.

31:35.917 --> 31:37.667
Your speech
was beautiful.

31:40.542 --> 31:41.166
Thanks.

31:44.625 --> 31:45.750
What you said...

31:48.458 --> 31:49.875
Did you mean it,
Dawson?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Every word.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.542
Which is why you should
turn around and go.

32:01.917 --> 32:02.959
To Pacey.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.708
What?

32:07.083 --> 32:08.417
Last year, you had
the opportunity

32:08.417 --> 32:09.750
to go to Paris and study,

32:09.750 --> 32:10.917
and because of me,
you didn't.

32:10.917 --> 32:12.333
Dawson, that wasn't
your fault.

32:12.333 --> 32:13.250
Yes, it was my fault,

32:13.250 --> 32:14.750
because I should
have made you go.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.917
But I was selfish,
and I didn't want you to go.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.667
I wanted you
to stay here with me.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.083
And I refuse to make
that mistake again.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.667
Well, Dawson, I mean,
what if it's my choice?

32:26.667 --> 32:28.417
I mean, what if I want to stay?

32:28.417 --> 32:30.583
Joey...come on.

32:34.208 --> 32:35.417
Even I can see it.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.500
Pacey is this year's Paris.

32:43.417 --> 32:44.583
And this time...

32:45.375 --> 32:46.834
you have to go.

32:47.291 --> 32:48.875
You have to see
for yourself, all right?

32:48.875 --> 32:51.250
I can stand here and tell
you that it's a colossal mistake

32:51.250 --> 32:52.625
and that all roads
lead back to me,

32:52.625 --> 32:54.208
but that's not gonna make
any bit of difference.

32:54.208 --> 32:56.291
Words and speeches
sound great, but...

32:56.792 --> 32:58.375
They don't add up
to anything.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.625
All that matters right now
is what you want.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.959
I don't even know
what I want, Dawson.

33:05.959 --> 33:06.959
Yes, you do.

33:10.375 --> 33:11.583
You want him.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.458
You want him
like I want you.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.041
You love him
like I love you.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.291
[LAUGHS]

33:18.291 --> 33:21.125
The only difference is he
loves you back the same way.

33:24.291 --> 33:26.208
And you deserve that.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.959
Ok? And I'm not
gonna be the one

33:28.959 --> 33:31.834
who stands in the way
of you getting that.

33:34.375 --> 33:35.667
You're free.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.917
You can do
whatever you want.

33:42.834 --> 33:44.792
But, Dawson, I want us
to still be friends,

33:44.792 --> 33:46.625
and I want to know that
you don't hate me--

33:46.625 --> 33:48.000
They're just words, Joey.

33:50.166 --> 33:51.917
They're just words.

33:53.834 --> 33:54.834
'Cause after you're done

33:54.834 --> 33:56.792
dispensing your
pleasantries here,

33:56.792 --> 33:59.500
you're gonna turn around and
you're gonna walk away from me.

34:01.667 --> 34:02.625
Aren't you?

34:06.458 --> 34:08.041
I have to, otherwise,
I'll never know.

34:08.041 --> 34:09.083
Just go.

34:11.708 --> 34:13.917
-But, Dawson--
-Jo, go, I'm telling you,

34:13.917 --> 34:16.375
before I take it all back,
alright? Just go!

34:18.250 --> 34:19.166
Go.

34:50.542 --> 34:52.708
Hey, Jack, I'm glad you're back.

34:53.041 --> 34:54.583
Want to show you
something.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.333
I'm not really in the
mood right now.

34:57.458 --> 34:58.417
Hey, what's the matter?

34:58.417 --> 34:59.708
I just wanna
be alone.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.417
Hey, hey, hey,
you can talk to me.

35:01.792 --> 35:02.792
This is something you really

35:02.792 --> 35:04.208
don't wanna hear about,
believe me.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.375
You don't know that.

35:05.959 --> 35:06.542
Really?

35:12.041 --> 35:13.375
You wanna hear
that I found out

35:13.375 --> 35:15.583
that Ethan got back
together with his ex?

35:18.500 --> 35:20.875
You want to hear that I found
that out after I kissed him?

35:21.542 --> 35:23.917
Well, that's...
interesting.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.625
Yeah, it's-- it's
interesting, right?

35:28.208 --> 35:29.333
Come on, admit it.

35:30.125 --> 35:32.166
The thought of me kissing
another guy disgusts you.

35:32.166 --> 35:33.417
I disgust you!

35:33.417 --> 35:34.333
That is not true.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.250
Yes, it is!

35:35.792 --> 35:36.375
You're angry.

35:36.959 --> 35:38.375
You're hurting right now,
but I will not let you

35:38.375 --> 35:39.375
pick an argument with me

35:39.375 --> 35:40.917
just so you can
vent your frustration!

35:40.917 --> 35:44.291
No, no. I spent an entire year
developing this relationship...

35:44.708 --> 35:46.875
And working on it.
Now it's a wash!

35:46.875 --> 35:49.291
The whole year's a wash!
My whole life's a wash!

35:49.291 --> 35:51.417
Your life is not a wash!

35:51.792 --> 35:53.500
You hurt now because
you had the guts to

35:53.500 --> 35:55.291
to put yourself
out there

35:56.166 --> 35:57.959
and go after
what you wanted.

35:58.667 --> 36:00.917
[SOBS] I can't.

36:02.125 --> 36:03.125
[SNIFFLES]

36:03.125 --> 36:05.291
I can't keep going
through this.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.208
It's like having all the
problems of a typical teenager,

36:15.208 --> 36:18.667
and there's this whole other
level of constant fear...

36:20.250 --> 36:21.166
and pain.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.625
Do you know the anguish I
went through over a kiss--

36:25.625 --> 36:26.667
One stupid little kiss?

36:26.667 --> 36:28.333
Most people don't
have to do that!

36:28.959 --> 36:30.875
You're right.
they don't.

36:31.500 --> 36:32.917
Then why me?

36:35.500 --> 36:36.917
I don't want
to be different.

36:42.917 --> 36:44.500
I didn't ask to be gay.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.834
No more than I asked
for a gay son...

36:48.166 --> 36:50.166
But, boy,
am I glad I got one.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.708
You don't mean that.

36:53.667 --> 36:55.208
Yeah.

36:55.208 --> 36:56.458
I do.

37:43.792 --> 37:44.542
ANDIE: Oh!

37:44.792 --> 37:46.917
Behold! Your official
pick-me-up posse.

37:47.625 --> 37:48.959
Yeah. Andie and I
were chatting

37:48.959 --> 37:50.750
and thought that maybe
you could use a little company.

37:51.458 --> 37:54.458
So then I took it upon myself
to call Jack Attack here

37:54.458 --> 37:55.750
and tell him
to hurry over.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.417
And then I took it upon myself

37:57.417 --> 37:58.959
to run to the video store

37:58.959 --> 38:00.250
and grab some movies.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.834
Thanks, guys. I really
appreciate you coming over,

38:04.542 --> 38:06.959
but I really think what I need
right now is to just--

38:06.959 --> 38:08.417
Sorry, Dawson.
No can do.

38:08.750 --> 38:12.542
Yeah, I think that the words "I
wanna be alone right now"

38:12.542 --> 38:14.458
are used far too often
around here.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.959
Kinda ranks right
up there with, uh...

38:17.959 --> 38:19.250
"Can we talk?"

38:19.875 --> 38:21.500
And there's those
countless references

38:21.500 --> 38:23.458
towards all things
Freud and Spielberg.

38:23.708 --> 38:25.250
Yeah. I'm pretty sure of it.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.792
We're not in Capeside
anymore, Toto.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.083
This is some
alternate reality

38:30.083 --> 38:32.625
where our intellects are
sharper, our quips are wittier,

38:32.625 --> 38:35.291
and our hearts
are repeatedly broken

38:35.291 --> 38:36.959
while faintly
in the background,

38:36.959 --> 38:40.458
some soon to be out of date
contempo pop music plays.

38:40.458 --> 38:42.291
So why does it
hurt so much?

38:42.750 --> 38:45.500
Because our pain
makes us real, Dawson.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.083
But we can't do it alone.

38:48.583 --> 38:49.834
None of us can.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.375
Sit down.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.458
So, what'd you guys do today?

38:59.291 --> 39:00.625
Oh, my god.

39:00.625 --> 39:03.333
You are not gonna
believe these two.

39:03.959 --> 39:05.667
Well, it all started
with Jen.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.041
Well...

39:15.959 --> 39:17.125
Pacey!

39:17.125 --> 39:18.125
Pacey!

39:18.125 --> 39:19.417
Pacey!

39:21.291 --> 39:22.625
Pacey!

39:23.166 --> 39:24.333
Pace!

39:25.000 --> 39:26.708
Pacey?

39:27.250 --> 39:28.834
You want something, Jo?

39:30.083 --> 39:31.667
I want to talk to you.

39:31.667 --> 39:34.166
No, no. A bit late for this now.
I'm leaving.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.667
You can't stop me,
so don't even try.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.125
No, that's not
why I'm here.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.208
So why are you here?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.208
You wanna say
good-bye again?

39:41.834 --> 39:43.625
Maybe you wanted to rub
it in a little bit, huh?

39:43.625 --> 39:45.083
Look, I don't want
to stop you, Pacey,

39:45.083 --> 39:46.750
and I don't want to stop
Dawson, and I don't want

39:46.750 --> 39:49.250
to be stopped, not by either
of you, not by anyone, see?

39:49.542 --> 39:51.333
I mean, that's what this
whole year has been about.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.417
We've been trying to stop
each other from moving on

39:53.417 --> 39:57.333
and from growing up,
but...but not you.

39:58.041 --> 39:59.708
I mean, you're different, and...

39:59.708 --> 40:01.542
You've challenged me
every step of the way

40:01.542 --> 40:03.708
and you've been there
every step of the way.

40:04.458 --> 40:07.750
Jo, departure time is in
T minus thirty seconds,

40:07.750 --> 40:10.166
so if there's a point,
I suggest you get to it.

40:16.708 --> 40:18.583
I think I'm in love with you.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.500
You think
or you know?

40:28.250 --> 40:29.667
I know.

40:34.417 --> 40:36.708
I've known it since
the moment you kissed me

40:36.708 --> 40:37.959
and maybe even before that.

40:37.959 --> 40:40.917
And... [EXHALES]
scary as it is,

40:40.917 --> 40:42.834
I don't want to deny
it any more, Pacey.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.166
I don't want to run
from it,

40:44.166 --> 40:45.959
and I don't want
to let it run from me.

40:47.750 --> 40:48.792
So...

40:51.083 --> 40:53.458
What are we gonna
do here, Jo?

40:54.166 --> 40:56.000
I wanna come with you.

40:56.917 --> 40:58.250
[LAUGHS] What?

40:59.166 --> 41:00.083
You crazy?

41:00.083 --> 41:01.166
Mm-mmm.

41:01.166 --> 41:02.375
I wanna stop standing still.

41:02.375 --> 41:04.291
I wanna move forward.
I wanna come with you.

41:04.291 --> 41:06.959
What about Bessie and the B&B?
They need you.

41:09.041 --> 41:11.750
Not as much as I
need you, Pacey.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.625
Ah-ah-ah!

41:23.458 --> 41:24.750
[CHUCKLES]

41:27.458 --> 41:28.959
Permission
to come aboard?

41:33.500 --> 41:35.625
Permission granted.

41:47.959 --> 41:49.333
[LAUGHS]

41:50.542 --> 41:51.959
You can swim,
can't you?

41:52.500 --> 41:53.125
Of course.

41:53.792 --> 41:56.208
I'm just kinda worried about
the next change of clothes.

41:56.208 --> 41:57.333
That's nothing
to worry about.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.458
We're gonna hit the
next port in a few days.

42:00.166 --> 42:01.500
Few days?

42:01.500 --> 42:03.792
Yeah! Or a few
days after that.
