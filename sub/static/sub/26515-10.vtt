00:25.896 --> 00:28.932
[Kory] <i>I can't stop thinking
about the asylum.</i>

00:28.966 --> 00:30.634
You were talking
in your sleep.

00:30.667 --> 00:31.969
Anything revealing?

00:32.003 --> 00:34.371
I'd tell you
if I could understand
a word you were saying.

00:34.405 --> 00:36.707
<i>-Being Robin
doesn't work anymore.
-Wait.</i>

00:36.740 --> 00:38.276
[Dick] <i>But not being Robin
doesn't work either.</i>

00:38.308 --> 00:40.645
-You sure
you're gonna be okay?
-What do you think?

00:40.679 --> 00:43.046
[Donna] <i>I just realized that
I could do more good
being Donna Troy.</i>

00:43.079 --> 00:46.951
I quit.
Not Batman this time. Robin.

00:46.984 --> 00:48.520
[Donna] <i>What happened?</i>

00:48.552 --> 00:51.889
<i>I couldn't get a handle
on the violence.
It's getting worse.</i>

00:51.921 --> 00:54.225
[muffled screams]

00:54.258 --> 00:55.926
-So, how did you do it?
-Do what?

00:55.960 --> 00:57.195
Quit.

00:57.228 --> 01:00.430
[Donna] <i>I didn't quit.
I just stopped.</i>

01:00.465 --> 01:01.698
How is that different?

01:01.731 --> 01:02.801
You'll figure it out.

01:02.834 --> 01:06.436
At the asylum,
when I attacked that guy...

01:06.471 --> 01:09.707
[Kory] <i>How did it feel?</i>
[Gar] <i>I didn't hate it.</i>

01:09.740 --> 01:12.442
You shouldn't.
It's part of who you are.

01:12.477 --> 01:15.980
[Gar] <i>When I'm the tiger,
it's not completely me.</i>

01:16.013 --> 01:21.013
It's like I'm inside something
<i>controlling it,
but it has control, too.</i>

01:22.820 --> 01:25.656
-How long you
been looking for Rachel?
-Few months, I thought.

01:25.689 --> 01:28.191
[Dick] <i>Seems like a lot longer
than a few months.</i>

01:28.225 --> 01:29.427
What's that writing?

01:29.459 --> 01:30.828
Why do you have pictures
of letters

01:30.828 --> 01:32.697
in some offshoot of Sumerian
on your cell phone?

01:32.697 --> 01:34.765
That's not Sumerian.
We searched every database.

01:34.765 --> 01:35.698
I said "offshoot."

01:35.700 --> 01:38.269
This alphabet has
been lost for centuries.

01:38.302 --> 01:42.740
Rachel's birthday...
The mortality rate
spikes every year on that day.

01:42.774 --> 01:45.743
Over 200,000
additional dead worldwide.

01:45.777 --> 01:47.512
I think she's
part of a prophecy.

01:47.545 --> 01:50.213
People around you aren't safe.

02:08.831 --> 02:10.901
I have a house. In Ohio.

02:10.936 --> 02:13.736
All of you are welcome there
for as long as you want.

02:13.770 --> 02:14.772
It's the least I can do.

02:14.806 --> 02:16.606
[Dick] <i>This could be, like,
our secret base.</i>

02:16.639 --> 02:19.842
Cool.

02:19.877 --> 02:21.612
Kory? Are you okay?

02:21.645 --> 02:24.382
<i>Something's wrong with me.
What happened at the asylum...</i>

02:24.414 --> 02:28.086
If your brain is hurt,
maybe I can heal it.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.687
It's definitely
a mission statement
for your friend Kory,

02:30.722 --> 02:33.524
who's referred to by name
or as Night or Starfire.

02:33.557 --> 02:34.792

She tried to kill my daughter.

I was trying to help Kory

05:25.997 --> 05:27.699
I must have
done something wrong.

06:01.232 --> 06:05.201
You tried to kill Rachel.

06:05.235 --> 06:07.404
What? No,
I would never do that.

you remembering?

what Kory's feeling before.

But I did this time,
and she wanted to kill me.

08:16.399 --> 08:19.470
But she didn't, too.

08:19.502 --> 08:23.507
She was conflicted.

Don't be so sure.

Here.

I'm sorry I was right
about your friend
wanting to kill Rachel.

10:13.650 --> 10:16.921
You weren't.
Kory's not a killer.

10:16.955 --> 10:20.125
She kills people sometimes,
but none of this makes sense.

10:20.158 --> 10:23.727
Kory loves Rachel.
She's done nothing
but try to help her.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.464
What we saw back there,

10:26.496 --> 10:29.301
that wasn't the real Kory.

10:29.333 --> 10:32.870
You're sleeping with her,
aren't you?

10:32.903 --> 10:34.739
You're making
too many excuses for her.

10:34.772 --> 10:36.908
And you have a thing
for dangerous women.

10:36.941 --> 10:38.743
"Dangerous women."
[scoffs]

10:38.775 --> 10:43.447
Except for Dawn.
You fucked that up.

10:46.048 --> 10:47.048
Yep.

-What's it been?

11:47.845 --> 11:49.779
Twenty years
since you left town?

11:49.813 --> 11:53.216
Don't make me count.
Too long.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.519
You look great.

11:55.552 --> 11:57.955
So do you.

11:57.989 --> 11:59.691
So, what happened?
Where you been?

11:59.725 --> 12:03.160
I heard you, uh,
moved to Chicago
with a boyfriend, or...

12:03.193 --> 12:08.193
Yeah, that's,
that's a long story.

12:10.134 --> 12:12.269
You here by yourself?

12:12.302 --> 12:14.337
No, I'm with my daughter
and her friend.

12:14.370 --> 12:15.806
Oh.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.139
Never had kids myself.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.913
How... How did you know
I was here?

12:22.947 --> 12:26.583
Oh. I'm, uh, on the job.

We had some trouble
at the train station
over in Dayton.

12:32.557 --> 12:34.859
Got a call
about a couple of
cars out here.

12:34.892 --> 12:36.726
Thought I'd check it out.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.162
You see anyone around here?

12:39.196 --> 12:42.899
No.

12:42.933 --> 12:46.336
How long you been home?

12:46.370 --> 12:49.005
Just a few hours.

12:49.039 --> 12:51.875
You staying long?

12:51.908 --> 12:55.511
For good. I hope.

12:55.546 --> 12:57.883
Well, good. Uh...

12:57.916 --> 13:01.285
If you're sticking around,
maybe we should
grab a drink or something.

The Hickory Grill
has still got their
Long Island Twofer Tuesdays.

13:04.788 --> 13:08.424
[both laugh]

13:08.458 --> 13:10.427
Okay.

13:10.461 --> 13:14.498
If you give me a couple days
to get my feet under me,

13:14.530 --> 13:16.767
um, then it's a date.

13:16.801 --> 13:19.370
Sounds good.
You know where to find me.

13:19.403 --> 13:21.004
Yep.

13:21.038 --> 13:24.489
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.

13:26.442 --> 13:29.293
[car engine starts]

14:17.894 --> 14:20.464
You gotta eat.

14:20.496 --> 14:22.746
I'm not hungry.

14:25.735 --> 14:26.736
Rachel.

14:26.770 --> 14:30.307
I must have done
something to Kory.

14:30.341 --> 14:35.341
Scrambled her brain
or drove her mad.

14:35.714 --> 14:40.714
I shouldn't have done it.
I only made
things worse for her.

14:41.285 --> 14:45.155
Even if you did
do something,

14:45.188 --> 14:47.958
which I don't think you did,

14:47.991 --> 14:50.841
it was an accident.

14:54.466 --> 14:58.201
Dick and Wonder Girl
are gonna figure it all out.

14:58.235 --> 15:00.837
They'll help Kory
and bring her back.

15:00.870 --> 15:04.341
Everything's gonna be fine.

15:04.374 --> 15:05.374
Okay?

15:11.782 --> 15:16.352
You can't stay here.

15:16.385 --> 15:18.755
What?

15:18.788 --> 15:21.592
Everybody I get close to,

15:21.625 --> 15:26.625
if they stay around me
long enough, they get hurt.

15:29.066 --> 15:32.336
That's not true.

15:32.370 --> 15:36.206
Bad things happen
to people around me.

15:36.240 --> 15:40.889
-Rachel, stop.
-Don't touch me!

15:46.984 --> 15:48.719
I'm so sorry.

15:48.751 --> 15:52.624
It's okay.

15:52.657 --> 15:56.727
Okay. If the soup's awful,
you can just tell me.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.565
There wasn't
a lot to work with
in the garden.

16:01.597 --> 16:04.447
The soup was great.

16:06.836 --> 16:10.586
I'll, uh, give you a sec.

16:11.942 --> 16:16.292
-[door closes]
-What's wrong?

16:18.515 --> 16:20.384
He shouldn't be
staying with us.

16:20.418 --> 16:23.868
Why? What was he doing?

16:26.557 --> 16:30.628
He was trying to
make me feel better.

16:30.662 --> 16:35.662
And you don't
want to feel better?

16:36.000 --> 16:40.604
Or are you scared to?

16:40.638 --> 16:42.340
Look...

16:42.373 --> 16:45.109
I know, after all
you've been through,

16:45.143 --> 16:47.979
after everything
that's happened,

16:48.011 --> 16:52.549
it's scary to hold on
to anyone, but,

16:52.583 --> 16:56.586
you have to hold on
to the people you care about.

16:56.620 --> 16:59.620
The people you love.

17:04.461 --> 17:08.865
I never should have
given you to Melissa.

17:08.898 --> 17:12.269
No matter
how frightened I was.

17:12.303 --> 17:15.006
I should have
run away with you.

17:15.038 --> 17:17.641
Not from you.

17:17.674 --> 17:20.178
That's the truth.

17:20.211 --> 17:24.248
And I'm so ashamed.

17:24.281 --> 17:29.153
Don't make the same mistake
I did, Rachel.

17:29.186 --> 17:32.623
Because it left me all alone.

17:32.655 --> 17:35.205
For far too long.

18:42.992 --> 18:45.692
[door creaks shut]

18:54.771 --> 18:57.321
[leaves rustling]

19:05.782 --> 19:09.886
[phone beeping]

19:09.920 --> 19:12.019
[line ringing]

19:18.395 --> 19:20.131
[phone beeps]

19:20.163 --> 19:23.000
[line ringing]

19:23.032 --> 19:25.583
[static crackles]

19:42.452 --> 19:46.353
-[tiger growls]
-[screams]

19:53.330 --> 19:56.030
Hey. Are you okay?

19:58.701 --> 20:00.352
No, I uh...

20:09.614 --> 20:12.316
There's something wrong
with this place.

20:12.349 --> 20:13.785
What do you mean?

20:13.817 --> 20:18.817
I don't know.
I just have a bad feeling.

20:19.690 --> 20:21.325
[sniffles]

20:21.358 --> 20:25.730
Maybe I'm just stressed out.

20:25.763 --> 20:30.763
Well, I'm sorry
I freaked out on you.

20:31.603 --> 20:34.105
It's, uh...
It's been a weird day.

20:34.137 --> 20:36.273
No.

20:36.307 --> 20:37.957
No, I suck.

20:41.845 --> 20:44.749
No. You don't.

20:44.782 --> 20:48.385
I'm happy you're here,
and I hope you stay.

20:48.419 --> 20:53.089
That's what
I should have said.

20:53.124 --> 20:55.625
Thanks, Rach...

20:55.659 --> 20:57.528
Gar?

20:57.561 --> 21:00.597
Ah, stomach just feels
a little weird.

21:00.632 --> 21:03.433
Are you gonna be sick?

21:03.468 --> 21:05.303
I just need to, uh,

21:05.336 --> 21:06.804
I just need to lay down.

21:06.836 --> 21:07.836
Okay.

21:43.773 --> 21:44.608
Who is she?

21:44.608 --> 21:46.277
I'm the person
who knocked you out.

21:46.309 --> 21:48.011
Bet you can't do it twice.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.314
Kory,

21:49.347 --> 21:51.414
whatever this is
you're going through,
please, let us help.

21:51.449 --> 21:53.651
I don't need your help.

21:53.684 --> 21:58.684
[woman] <i>Koriand'r. Koriand'r.
I missed you.</i>

21:58.722 --> 22:00.156
<i>I thought you were dead.</i>

22:00.191 --> 22:04.391
[echoing] <i>Dead, dead.</i>

22:06.230 --> 22:09.333
You're getting
your memories back.

22:09.366 --> 22:10.835
Yeah.

22:10.868 --> 22:14.373
But nothing makes sense.
I can't make
order to anything.

22:14.405 --> 22:19.405
All I know is I tried to kill
a girl that I love
and I don't know why.

22:25.516 --> 22:29.415
But the answer is in here.

23:04.355 --> 23:06.890
[whirring]

23:06.923 --> 23:08.224
[Dick] Whoa.

23:08.259 --> 23:09.626
[modulating bleeps]

23:09.660 --> 23:13.259
[Donna] What's going on?

23:26.309 --> 23:28.109
[Dick] Kory?

23:43.426 --> 23:46.297
This ship...

23:46.329 --> 23:47.829
I know it.

23:51.501 --> 23:53.001
It's mine.

23:56.641 --> 23:59.410
[woman] <i>Koriand'r.</i>

23:59.442 --> 24:01.542
<i>X'Hal.</i>

24:12.589 --> 24:14.390
[ramp thuds]

25:06.544 --> 25:11.115
You should get some rest, too.

25:11.148 --> 25:16.148
You know you can talk to me.
You can tell me anything.

25:17.354 --> 25:19.923
The power I have,

25:19.958 --> 25:23.560
does it somehow
also hurt people?

25:23.594 --> 25:25.762
Make people sick?

25:25.797 --> 25:28.165
First Kory, now Gar.

25:28.199 --> 25:31.169
Rachel, none of this
is your fault.

25:31.201 --> 25:36.201
But I have hurt people before.
You know that.

25:36.539 --> 25:38.809
The darkness inside me,

25:38.843 --> 25:42.246
the thing that wants
to hurt people,
is that from him?

25:42.278 --> 25:45.083
-Who?
-My father?

25:45.115 --> 25:48.551
This thing you call darkness,
it doesn't have to be that.

25:48.586 --> 25:51.788
You can decide how to use it.

25:51.823 --> 25:55.058
But when I do, people die.

25:55.093 --> 25:59.529
But you've helped people,
too, right?

25:59.563 --> 26:00.932
I guess I've tried.

26:00.964 --> 26:03.934
You have, and you will again.

26:03.968 --> 26:08.839
You will use
whatever it is inside you
to help people.

26:08.873 --> 26:13.544
What happened today...
[sighs]

26:13.576 --> 26:15.746
It's just bad luck.

26:15.779 --> 26:18.548
[electricity crackling]

26:18.582 --> 26:21.132
And an old house.

26:26.490 --> 26:27.959
[Dick] Kory?

26:27.991 --> 26:30.259
-Kory?
-[Kory] I'm here.

26:30.294 --> 26:32.993
[ship powering up]

26:38.501 --> 26:41.739
I gotta admit...
I'm impressed.

26:41.772 --> 26:44.842
How could you
forget something like this?

26:44.875 --> 26:47.577
I come from a planet
called Tamaran.

26:47.612 --> 26:51.848
Anything else coming back?

26:51.883 --> 26:55.386
These images in my head,
but they're moving too fast.

26:55.420 --> 26:58.256
I remember I came here
to Earth on this ship.

26:58.289 --> 27:03.289
I remember standing
at this console.

27:04.462 --> 27:09.462
This book is the only thing
in here that looks old.

27:11.736 --> 27:15.506
It's called<i>Gul'ron Dez Dire.</i>

27:15.538 --> 27:18.476
"Death of Worlds."

27:18.509 --> 27:19.558
Wait...

27:41.932 --> 27:44.535
We're looking
at a future projection.

27:44.567 --> 27:46.968
Tamaran burning.

27:50.574 --> 27:55.574
Unless Rachel dies,
my world will.

27:56.646 --> 27:58.782
And how does Rachel do that?

27:58.816 --> 28:02.686
She doesn't.
Someone from somewhere else.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.855
Another planet?

28:03.887 --> 28:08.526
No, another dimension.

28:08.558 --> 28:12.997
He came here long ago.

28:13.030 --> 28:17.568
Destroyed a world,
but he was banished somehow.

28:17.602 --> 28:22.602
[exhales] But I don't know.
This could all be wrong.

28:24.441 --> 28:27.746
[beeping]

28:27.778 --> 28:31.648
This being was
summoned to Earth
to conceive a daughter.

28:31.682 --> 28:33.683
Rachel.

28:33.718 --> 28:37.453
Her father.

28:37.488 --> 28:40.325
Trigon.

28:40.357 --> 28:43.027
He was pulled back to his home
and imprisoned,

28:43.060 --> 28:46.998
but she is the doorway
that he can walk through.

28:47.030 --> 28:52.030
The anchor that will
keep him here this time.

28:52.804 --> 28:57.241
Earth will be the first planet
that he will cover
in his darkness.

28:57.275 --> 29:02.275
But eventually,
everything, all worlds,
my world, will burn.

29:02.512 --> 29:04.913
[Donna] Hold on.

29:10.054 --> 29:13.723
We may have
a more immediate problem.

29:13.758 --> 29:18.407
This is
Rachel's father, right?

29:19.529 --> 29:21.330
This is Rachel.

29:21.365 --> 29:23.701
Who's this?

29:23.733 --> 29:25.869
Rachel's mother?

29:25.903 --> 29:30.040
They look cozy.

29:30.074 --> 29:34.344
It's a family affair.

29:34.377 --> 29:37.448
Fuck.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.580
[Gar coughing]

29:47.057 --> 29:49.907
[breathing heavily]

30:36.973 --> 30:38.476
Rachel?

30:38.509 --> 30:40.544
Rachel, sweetie, come on.
You've gotta get up.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.346
What is it? Is Kory back?

30:42.380 --> 30:47.329
No. It's Gar.
He's sick. Come on.

30:51.855 --> 30:53.990
Gar.

30:54.025 --> 30:55.259
Gar, can you hear me?

30:55.292 --> 30:57.493
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't know.

30:57.528 --> 30:58.962
[knocking on door]

30:58.996 --> 31:02.066
Maybe it's Dick.

31:02.099 --> 31:06.303
Stay here with Gar.
I'll go check.

31:06.336 --> 31:08.705
Gar.

31:08.739 --> 31:10.807
[banging on door]

31:10.840 --> 31:12.977
Tommy. Hi.

31:13.009 --> 31:16.280
Hi. Uh, thought I'd bring
a housewarming gift by.

31:16.314 --> 31:17.515
I saw the lights were on.

31:17.548 --> 31:19.717
[Rachel] Mom! I can't
stop the bleeding!

31:19.750 --> 31:21.152
-What's going on?
-[Rachel] Hurry!

31:21.184 --> 31:23.453
It's her friend. He's sick.

31:23.487 --> 31:27.625
Let me have a look.

31:27.657 --> 31:29.607
[Rachel] Mom!

31:33.298 --> 31:36.000
How long has he
been like this?

31:36.032 --> 31:37.634
We don't know.

31:37.667 --> 31:41.204
He was fine
a few hours ago.

31:41.239 --> 31:45.977
It's gonna be okay.
I'm a police officer.

31:46.009 --> 31:47.412
I just charged it.

31:47.444 --> 31:50.181
There's a landline
in the kitchen.

31:50.213 --> 31:54.152
I'll be right back, okay?

31:54.184 --> 31:59.184
-[sobbing]
-It's gonna be all right.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.729
Angela's been playing us
this whole time.

32:04.729 --> 32:09.729
The Organization, the asylum,
it was all about
getting Rachel back.

32:10.468 --> 32:11.769
What are you doing back there?

32:11.801 --> 32:14.739
Going through her stuff.

32:14.772 --> 32:17.907
It says there's a way
to defeat Trigon. One way.

32:17.942 --> 32:20.510
His daughter.

32:20.544 --> 32:21.912
-Rachel?
-Yes, but

32:21.945 --> 32:24.982
first she has to
complete the Trials.

32:25.017 --> 32:28.452
-"Trials." That's this word.
-What the hell are the Trials?

32:28.486 --> 32:31.856
Four hundred consecutive days
of the harshest
warrior training.

32:31.890 --> 32:35.359
None have ever survived it.
There's no way
she could possibly do that.

32:35.393 --> 32:40.393
If anyone could,
it would be Rachel.
You know her.

32:41.231 --> 32:44.231
Then we better move.

32:47.171 --> 32:49.871
[static crackling]

32:52.810 --> 32:57.347
The line's dead.
I'll use the radio in the car.

32:57.382 --> 32:58.848
You can't call anyone.

32:58.883 --> 33:00.817
What?

33:00.851 --> 33:02.419
[flesh squelching]

33:02.451 --> 33:04.087
[groaning]

33:04.121 --> 33:06.371
[grunts softly]

33:15.865 --> 33:17.501
I'm sorry.

33:17.535 --> 33:20.871
I would have
liked to get that drink.

33:20.904 --> 33:22.740
-[body thuds]
-[glass clinking]

33:22.772 --> 33:26.673
But I'm in a relationship.

33:30.881 --> 33:32.317
Is help coming?

33:32.349 --> 33:36.788
He went into town
to get the doctor,
but Gar's getting worse.

33:36.821 --> 33:39.455
We can't wait.
You're gonna
have to help him.

33:39.457 --> 33:40.457
Me?

33:40.457 --> 33:43.794
You can do it.
You can heal him.

33:43.827 --> 33:46.263
No. Look what happened
to Kory.

33:46.297 --> 33:47.699
-And--
-Rachel, look at me.

33:47.731 --> 33:50.134
You have your father's gifts,
and you need to use them now

33:50.167 --> 33:52.435
to save your friend's life.

33:52.469 --> 33:55.138
[gasping]

33:55.173 --> 33:57.272
You can do it.

34:00.911 --> 34:03.548
Good. It's working.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.482
[Rachel breathing rapidly]
Ah!

34:05.517 --> 34:08.619
He's dying! I can feel it.

34:08.652 --> 34:13.623
No. There's gotta
be some other...

34:13.657 --> 34:17.128
Your father.

34:17.161 --> 34:21.898
He's stronger than you.
He could save Gar.

34:21.931 --> 34:24.034
He would do that for you.

34:24.068 --> 34:25.302
I don't understand.

34:25.335 --> 34:27.605
He's always been
close to you, Rachel.

34:27.639 --> 34:32.639
Always nearby,
always looking over you.
We have to hurry.

34:35.512 --> 34:39.317
You have to
open your mind, Rachel.

34:39.349 --> 34:43.554
Think about your father.
How badly you want to see him.

34:43.588 --> 34:44.922
But I thought that he was--

34:44.954 --> 34:47.458
This is the only way
to save Gar.

34:47.492 --> 34:51.092
You have to concentrate.

34:56.666 --> 34:58.766
You can do it.

35:02.972 --> 35:04.842
Yes.

35:04.875 --> 35:06.974
You can do it.

35:11.182 --> 35:16.182
That's it, sweetie.
It's happening.
You're doing it, Rachel.

35:18.021 --> 35:19.690
Yes.

35:19.722 --> 35:23.094
You did it, Rachel.

35:23.126 --> 35:26.329
Bring him home.

35:26.364 --> 35:28.764
Bring him to me.

35:45.048 --> 35:46.699
[screaming]

35:59.230 --> 36:00.579
My child.

36:09.206 --> 36:11.606
The power's out.

36:23.186 --> 36:24.255
[Kory] He's here.

36:24.288 --> 36:28.057
We're too late.
It's already started.

36:28.092 --> 36:31.842
We have to get to Rachel.

36:38.135 --> 36:39.336
My love.

36:39.369 --> 36:44.369
All of this
was for you. Everything.

36:49.614 --> 36:54.614
Your faith has
never failed me, lover.

36:57.487 --> 37:00.123
My friend is dying.

37:00.157 --> 37:04.728
Can you save him?

37:04.762 --> 37:09.762
There is nothing
I wouldn't give you.

37:25.949 --> 37:28.485
So unusual.

37:28.518 --> 37:30.469
Boy or beast?

37:42.934 --> 37:45.369
You'll have
a lifetime to decide.

37:45.402 --> 37:48.871
[gasping]

37:48.905 --> 37:50.405
Thank you.

38:04.121 --> 38:06.670
I'm finally home.

38:17.568 --> 38:21.539
[electricity crackling]

38:21.572 --> 38:23.474
What the fuck is going on?

38:23.507 --> 38:26.277
The air... It's shimmering.

38:26.309 --> 38:31.309
It's right where
the house should be.

38:33.083 --> 38:37.887
Dick, wait!

38:37.920 --> 38:39.121
Come on.

38:45.463 --> 38:49.032
Dick got through.
Why can't we?

38:49.065 --> 38:53.436
Is it time to eat the world?

38:53.471 --> 38:57.521
Not until her heart breaks.

39:02.045 --> 39:04.295
They're coming.

39:13.490 --> 39:15.958
[theme music playing]
