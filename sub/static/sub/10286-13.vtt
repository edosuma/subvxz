00:04.582 --> 00:06.174
Your Honor.

00:09.754 --> 00:11.244
Anybody seen the judge?

00:11.422 --> 00:14.186
- Not lately.
- Oh, that could be him.

00:14.425 --> 00:16.893
No. Harry usually twirls more.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.692
- Calendar update, sir.
- Thanks.

00:24.936 --> 00:26.404
My pleasure, sir.

00:26.572 --> 00:28.403
- Charley?
- Sir?

00:28.774 --> 00:31.242
I just danced you down the halls
of the building.

00:31.410 --> 00:33.378
- Yes, sir.
- Doesn't that strike you as odd?

00:33.545 --> 00:34.569
A little.

00:34.746 --> 00:37.909
Most people react with alarm
when I do that kind of stuff.

00:38.083 --> 00:41.814
- I'll try and do better next time, sir.
- Oh, no. That's okay.

00:41.987 --> 00:43.978
I appreciate your indifference.

00:44.723 --> 00:46.554
I hope you like the typing job.

00:46.725 --> 00:48.955
- Looks great.
- I can do it over if you'd like.

00:49.127 --> 00:51.527
Not for my taste.
How's that for a type job, guys?

00:51.697 --> 00:53.062
- Nice!
- Pretty.

00:53.465 --> 00:55.194
Wow. No smudges.

00:56.068 --> 00:58.434
- Keep up the good work.
- I'll try, sir.

00:59.037 --> 01:01.528
- What a nice woman.
- Perfect.

01:01.740 --> 01:05.676
Pretty, obedient, and knows
the meaning of the word "fetch."

01:06.311 --> 01:07.573
Dan!

01:07.813 --> 01:11.011
Come on! She's been running around
like an attention-starved puppy...

01:11.184 --> 01:12.742
...for the last couple of weeks.

01:12.952 --> 01:15.750
Weren't you eager to please
when you were just starting out?

01:15.922 --> 01:18.288
Sucking up to people who can help you
is one thing.

01:18.458 --> 01:21.518
Being nice to everybody is sick.

01:24.063 --> 01:26.156
Hello, gorgeous!

01:30.970 --> 01:33.996
- Tell me, what do you need, darling?
- Pack of cigarettes.

01:34.374 --> 01:36.604
They say smoking is bad
for you, you know.

01:36.776 --> 01:41.076
Then give me a plug of tobacco
and a can to spit in.

01:42.048 --> 01:44.642
I know. Who needs a lecture, right?

01:44.817 --> 01:47.718
All I'm saying is that a body like that...

01:48.121 --> 01:50.590
...you should be good to it.

01:50.891 --> 01:53.052
I would be.

01:54.395 --> 01:56.329
I'll find a vending machine.

01:57.565 --> 01:58.793
No. Wait.

01:59.066 --> 02:00.693
Here, Selma.

02:00.935 --> 02:03.062
I know your name.
I know your brand.

02:03.237 --> 02:05.467
- How much?
- They're on the house.

02:05.639 --> 02:07.698
Then I'll take a carton.

02:09.443 --> 02:12.378
Selma, I hope you won't
mind my saying this...

02:13.080 --> 02:15.810
...but I've had my eye
on you for quite a while.

02:16.550 --> 02:19.041
I need matches too.

02:19.553 --> 02:22.488
Selma, please. I'm only human.

02:24.091 --> 02:25.456
My name is Bernie.

02:26.293 --> 02:28.386
Bernie the human. Got it.

02:28.929 --> 02:31.523
But wait!
How about some dinner...

02:31.699 --> 02:33.395
...on me?
- Sure.

02:33.568 --> 02:36.969
Next time, my place.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.485 --> 03:25.386
- Well, hello again.
- I got a gun, Bernie.

03:25.554 --> 03:27.954
You look very sexy in that uniform.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.285
Bullets, Bernie. I got those too.

03:31.260 --> 03:33.524
I do very well financially, you know.

03:33.696 --> 03:36.358
- Is that so?
- You know that stand in there?

03:36.632 --> 03:38.293
That's only the tip of the iceberg.

03:38.501 --> 03:41.959
I got another one, much bigger.
Over in the municipal building.

03:42.271 --> 03:46.207
I sell more breath mints
than anybody else in the city.

03:46.475 --> 03:48.875
Life in the fast lane, huh?

03:56.052 --> 03:58.180
Ready whenever you're through
rummaging, sir.

03:58.355 --> 04:00.721
- Just a minute.
- Looking for something, Your Honor?

04:00.891 --> 04:02.188
Yeah. My rabbit's foot.

04:02.359 --> 04:04.088
The arrest report on the next case.

04:04.261 --> 04:06.923
- What did it look like?
- It was about this big, fuzzy.

04:07.097 --> 04:08.257
- Green?
- Yeah.

04:08.432 --> 04:10.366
Oh, sir, I threw it out for you.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.559
Threw it out?

04:12.736 --> 04:16.137
Miss Tracy, that was my lucky
rabbit's foot. I had it for over 25 years.

04:16.305 --> 04:18.206
- Oh, my God.
- Now, don't worry, honey.

04:18.375 --> 04:21.606
It was just laying there,
shedding on your papers...

04:21.778 --> 04:23.006
...and smelling funny.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.239
Old bunny parts do that.

04:26.717 --> 04:27.877
Sir, don't worry.

04:28.051 --> 04:30.713
I'll find that rabbit's foot
if it's the last thing I do.

04:30.887 --> 04:32.354
Don't worry about it.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.990
It was just a silly old thing, anyway.
I'll be fine.

04:44.102 --> 04:47.128
Cancel my hang-gliding lesson,
okay, Charley?

04:48.339 --> 04:52.002
If this is gonna take a while,
I need to hit the head before we start.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.741
Who might that be?

04:53.911 --> 04:56.641
Mitchell Bowers, Your Honor.
The defendant, my client.

04:56.814 --> 04:58.304
The arrest report, sir.

04:59.617 --> 05:01.551
Breaking and entering, Mr. Bowers.

05:01.719 --> 05:05.348
I'm innocent. How can you arrest a man
for breaking and entering his own home?

05:05.723 --> 05:06.951
Mr. Prosecutor?

05:07.125 --> 05:10.492
Your Honor, we have
a bit of a legal gray area here.

05:10.995 --> 05:14.829
- How gray?
- You see, Mr. Bowers here is dead.

05:16.601 --> 05:19.035
In the old days, we used to bury them.

05:19.203 --> 05:22.605
Then they never gave any trouble again.

05:23.909 --> 05:28.369
Well, Your Honor, Mr. Bowers bought
the farm in the legal sense a year ago, June.

05:28.547 --> 05:30.811
When his wife had him declared dead.

05:30.983 --> 05:34.419
Mitch? When I got that letter about you,
I had to assume...

05:34.586 --> 05:36.986
...the government knew what
they were talking about.

05:37.156 --> 05:38.384
That's your first mistake.

05:38.590 --> 05:39.818
Have a seat, pumpkin.

05:39.992 --> 05:42.358
Marrying that little twerp
was your second.

05:42.761 --> 05:44.729
- Miss Williams.
- Your Honor...

05:44.930 --> 05:47.797
...my client served with the Marine Corps
in Vietnam.

05:47.966 --> 05:51.231
He was presumed to have been
killed in action in 1973...

05:51.403 --> 05:54.429
...but in reality, he was captured
by an enemy patrol...

05:54.606 --> 05:57.507
...and spent the next several years
in one of their prisons.

05:57.676 --> 05:59.769
While I'm busting my butt trying
to escape...

05:59.945 --> 06:03.745
...she hires some lawyer to snuff me out
so she can marry that dipstick.

06:04.417 --> 06:05.975
The dipstick in question...

06:06.152 --> 06:09.918
Mr. Duane Sedgewick,
the lady's present husband.

06:10.156 --> 06:11.680
Would you all approach the bench?

06:11.858 --> 06:16.557
Why are we wasting time?
Just let me and him arm-wrestle for her.

06:17.430 --> 06:20.695
Your Honor, I can understand
Mr. Bowers' pique.

06:20.867 --> 06:23.097
This has been quite a shock
for me as well as...

06:23.269 --> 06:24.736
Stow it, four-eyes.

06:26.206 --> 06:28.766
Four-eyes? How archaic.

06:28.942 --> 06:30.603
That'll be enough name-calling.

06:30.777 --> 06:32.802
Go on, Mr. Dipstick...
I mean...

06:34.781 --> 06:37.147
Your Honor,
I'd like to clear up this notion...

06:37.317 --> 06:39.080
...that I'm some sort of home wrecker.

06:39.252 --> 06:41.482
That I seduced Nora while he was away.

06:41.654 --> 06:43.485
That couldn't be farther
from the truth.

06:43.756 --> 06:45.621
Like we used to say
in the Corps:

06:45.792 --> 06:47.556
"Any port in a storm." Right, Nora?

06:47.728 --> 06:50.196
I am telling you, it was not physical.

06:50.364 --> 06:52.832
Not for a long time.

06:53.834 --> 06:58.100
Mitch, from the time you left the States,
I was completely...

06:58.272 --> 07:00.866
...you know, celibate...

07:01.041 --> 07:02.770
...for over nine years.

07:02.977 --> 07:04.638
Say what?

07:05.813 --> 07:08.748
And all those years, I loved you.

07:08.916 --> 07:10.383
- I still do.
- Great.

07:10.551 --> 07:12.781
Then dump Mr. Potato Head here
and let's go home.

07:13.721 --> 07:16.087
- I can't do that.
- Why not, Nora?

07:16.257 --> 07:17.519
Because.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.615
I love him too.

07:20.961 --> 07:23.225
I understand that
there's a lot of heartache...

07:23.397 --> 07:25.297
...and personal anguish involved here.

07:25.466 --> 07:28.903
But I'm afraid all I can deal with is
the charge before me. Miss Tracy?

07:29.838 --> 07:33.069
- Miss Tracy?
- Still looking for the foot, sir.

07:33.241 --> 07:36.938
Would you mind putting the garbage down
and finding me the summary of damages?

07:37.112 --> 07:38.101
Right away.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.305
Would the counsels approach the bench?

07:41.149 --> 07:43.617
I'm afraid there's not much
we can do here, guys.

07:43.785 --> 07:45.753
- This is a case for a civil court.
- Agreed.

07:45.921 --> 07:48.287
But if the prosecution
would drop the charges...

07:48.456 --> 07:50.947
- Summary of the damages, sir.
- These are sticky.

07:51.126 --> 07:53.686
- Could be jelly.
- That'll come right out.

07:53.862 --> 07:56.023
- No, that just smears it.
- You missed a spot.

07:56.231 --> 07:58.199
It's fine. It's fine.
It's great.

07:58.366 --> 08:00.527
The saliva has removed
most of the jelly.

08:00.702 --> 08:04.001
What are the locks for? You never
needed them when I was around.

08:04.172 --> 08:06.936
- You never had antiques.
- Never had any use for them.

08:07.108 --> 08:08.803
Never had use for poachers, either.

08:08.977 --> 08:11.742
- I got a mind...
- lf you have, I've seen no evidence of it.

08:11.914 --> 08:13.211
Oh, honeys, please!

08:13.382 --> 08:16.874
You got 24 hours to get you and
your antiques out of my apartment.

08:17.053 --> 08:18.748
Will both of you
please stop it?!

08:18.921 --> 08:20.445
Mrs. Sedgewick.

08:20.623 --> 08:23.990
I'm... I'm sorry, Your Honor. I really am.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.758
I knew she was gonna do that.
I felt it coming on.

08:26.929 --> 08:29.022
I mean, I felt... I knew it.

08:29.765 --> 08:32.597
You see, I don't wanna hurt
either one of them.

08:32.802 --> 08:34.565
They're good men.

08:35.104 --> 08:37.265
They both, in their own ways...

08:37.506 --> 08:40.373
...have made me
the happiest woman in the world.

08:40.977 --> 08:43.605
- Come on, now, honey. Stop it.
- Don't cry, Nora.

08:43.779 --> 08:46.009
Take your hands off her,
or we'll end this quick.

08:46.182 --> 08:51.085
Oh, yes, violence! Just the sort of behavior
I'd expect from a borderline Homo sapien.

08:51.287 --> 08:54.815
Why, you...
I never even hugged my father!

08:54.992 --> 08:57.460
All right. I've had enough!

08:57.627 --> 09:01.028
So have I. Can't you see
that Nora is mine now?

09:01.264 --> 09:03.755
- Over my dead body!
- Lf you two gentlemen...

09:04.768 --> 09:06.827
- He's out cold!
- Get the ice.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.097
There's some in my refrigerator. I'll get it!

09:16.847 --> 09:20.112
Brown bag, tuna. Help yourself.

09:22.285 --> 09:23.912
Did I mention it was
on whole wheat?

09:29.793 --> 09:32.353
All right, can we sit up, Mr. Fielding?

09:32.729 --> 09:35.027
- There you go.
- There we are.

09:36.901 --> 09:39.369
- I can't breathe.
- That's normal.

09:39.804 --> 09:42.398
Not in my family.

09:43.074 --> 09:46.202
- How is he, doc?
- He took a real nasty bump on the snoot.

09:47.011 --> 09:50.538
That's based on what, nine,
10 years of higher education?

09:51.582 --> 09:53.140
It's definitely broken.

09:53.317 --> 09:56.013
- Thanks for taking care of it.
- It should be all right...

09:56.187 --> 09:58.587
...but we ought to get x-rays
as soon as possible.

09:58.756 --> 10:03.159
I mean, if it didn't set right,
we would have to re-break it, wouldn't we?

10:06.264 --> 10:08.732
- Dan, are you okay to work?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

10:08.900 --> 10:13.837
Just as long as I stay away from words
like "small claims" or "Smithsonian."

10:15.106 --> 10:16.437
- I'm sorry.
- You know...

10:16.607 --> 10:19.839
...I have a little spinal irregularity
you might find amusing also.

10:21.647 --> 10:23.342
Charley, can we try to rearrange...?

10:23.816 --> 10:25.113
Charley?

10:25.284 --> 10:28.082
No trace.
Not a piece of fur, nothing.

10:28.487 --> 10:31.513
Forget about the rabbit's foot.
It was an accident. It's gone.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.214
Don't worry about it, I'm not.

10:33.392 --> 10:34.791
What I did was unforgivable.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.758
It's forgivable.
Look, I'm not upset. I'm smiling.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.297
I wouldn't blame you
if you fired me.

10:40.532 --> 10:45.196
Charley, I'm happy with you,
and I'm happy with your work. Okay?

10:45.971 --> 10:48.633
- Thank you, sir.
- Yuck!

10:50.209 --> 10:53.372
Tuna juice. Leaky bag in the garbage.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.842
No, it's okay. I'm left-handed.

10:56.014 --> 10:57.641
- Your Honor?
- Yeah, Bull?

10:58.250 --> 11:00.377
Your Honor, I put...

11:02.589 --> 11:04.853
- I put Bowers in the holding cell.
- Good.

11:05.024 --> 11:08.482
I wanna see him and the Sedgewicks
in my chambers right after I wash up.

11:08.661 --> 11:10.094
I was hoping you'd say that.

11:11.764 --> 11:13.254
Fish.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.725
Duck.

11:19.806 --> 11:22.070
- Bernie?
- I knew you'd come back.

11:22.242 --> 11:23.470
You got any aspirin?

11:23.643 --> 11:25.076
Extra-strength or regular?

11:25.245 --> 11:27.770
If you don't see what you want,
I can order it for you.

11:27.981 --> 11:30.541
Bernie, It's not for me. It's for the DA.

11:30.717 --> 11:33.584
And please, stop making a fuss over me.

11:33.753 --> 11:35.744
I am not interested.

11:36.256 --> 11:38.884
Selma, I feel I have a lot to offer you.

11:39.425 --> 11:41.791
For example, companionship.

11:41.961 --> 11:44.522
That's why God gave us TV.

11:46.233 --> 11:48.701
Selma, you're the kind of person...

11:48.869 --> 11:51.099
...I could live out the golden years with.

11:51.705 --> 11:55.300
Bernie, I'm sure you're
a nice guy and all that...

11:55.476 --> 11:57.967
...but I am not looking for a man.

11:58.412 --> 12:01.939
Did I mention the two Plymouths
and the life insurance policy?

12:02.550 --> 12:06.418
Bernie, I want to be alone.

12:07.922 --> 12:10.015
Selma, are you trying
to tell me something?

12:15.896 --> 12:17.124
You again, huh?

12:18.666 --> 12:21.499
You know, this intimidation
stuff is just not working.

12:21.802 --> 12:23.292
So I lost my rabbit's foot.

12:23.470 --> 12:26.565
So what? It was more of a keepsake
than a lucky charm, anyway.

12:26.741 --> 12:28.675
I'm just not that superstitious.

12:28.843 --> 12:31.141
Besides, no bad luck has befallen me...

12:31.313 --> 12:36.046
...unless you want to count some jelly
on some papers or some tuna...

12:37.586 --> 12:39.053
Roll over.

12:39.221 --> 12:40.916
Roll over!

12:41.289 --> 12:43.587
Give me a dog any day.

13:05.180 --> 13:09.618
The judge would like to see you two
in his chambers, right through that door.

13:16.626 --> 13:18.093
Yeah?

13:19.395 --> 13:21.158
- Here he is, Your Honor.
- Thanks, Bull.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.763
- You need me?
- I don't think so.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.127
We're not gonna have
any more punching, are we?

13:25.301 --> 13:26.768
- No, sir.
- It's okay.

13:30.139 --> 13:32.937
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
It was just one of those things.

13:33.109 --> 13:36.272
You broke one of those things.

13:38.314 --> 13:41.750
- You wanted to see us, Your Honor?
- Yes. I wanted to see you all.

13:42.685 --> 13:44.482
Baby, are you all right?

13:44.654 --> 13:46.485
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:48.257 --> 13:49.919
Here's the aspirin.

13:51.094 --> 13:52.356
Is that comfortable?

13:52.529 --> 13:54.190
It's supposed to help drainage.

13:55.265 --> 13:57.631
I have a lot of internal weeping.

13:58.402 --> 14:01.735
Come on, Dan. Let's go find
a place for you to lie down.

14:01.905 --> 14:03.770
Okay. Don't let go.

14:03.940 --> 14:07.103
I won't. I won't. Careful.
There's a little warp in the floor.

14:10.814 --> 14:13.544
So we've got a real toughie here,
don't we?

14:13.750 --> 14:17.550
- Not really, judge, the way I see it.
- That was a rhetorical question, Mr. Bowers.

14:17.721 --> 14:19.188
I'd like a chance to answer it.

14:20.524 --> 14:22.014
A few good men.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.319
Hey, look, buddy.
You stole my wife, okay?

14:24.494 --> 14:26.189
But don't be knocking the Corps!

14:26.363 --> 14:27.591
Put a lid on it.

14:27.931 --> 14:30.627
Now, Mrs. Sedgewick...

14:32.036 --> 14:33.333
...it's up to you.

14:34.072 --> 14:37.166
- What is?
- You've gotta choose between these men.

14:37.642 --> 14:39.166
Will it be Mitch...

14:41.145 --> 14:43.636
...or husband number two?

14:49.354 --> 14:50.685
I don't...

14:51.255 --> 14:53.120
I don't know!

14:53.391 --> 14:56.622
They are two completely different men...

14:56.794 --> 14:59.058
...and yet I love them both.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.897
How do you measure love?

15:01.065 --> 15:02.828
- Well, in boot camp, we...
- Mitch.

15:03.601 --> 15:04.932
Rhetorical again, huh?

15:06.003 --> 15:08.130
But I think I've got an answer
to this problem.

15:08.373 --> 15:10.170
- You do?
- Simple, really.

15:10.341 --> 15:13.174
You're gonna feel silly
you didn't think of it yourselves.

15:13.344 --> 15:16.178
You two guys share her.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.746
- What?!
- What do you think?

15:18.984 --> 15:20.315
Mitch?

15:20.486 --> 15:22.920
This is the kind you answer.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.553
Off the record?

15:25.090 --> 15:27.217
I think your porch light's
burned out, judge.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.418
- Duane?
- I gotta go along with Mitch on that one.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.064
This may seem
a little untraditional at first...

15:33.232 --> 15:34.995
...but trust me,
you'll get used to it.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.658
It may mean an extra chair
at the breakfast table...

15:37.836 --> 15:40.236
...or working out
a sleeping schedule, but, hey...

15:40.506 --> 15:43.907
...we're talking about
Nora's happiness, aren't we?

15:46.078 --> 15:48.171
I love two people.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.279
That doesn't sound
as bad as it feels.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.382
Yeah.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.551
- Your Honor, l...
- Charley, I want you to draft a document.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.194
This is nothing official, folks.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.421
We'll just rough out a sample agreement.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.566
You can take it to your lawyers,
have it modified, add clauses.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.201
I'll get a pad.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.868
Miss Tracy?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.468
Your dress.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.467
Beef stew.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.910
You've been in the swill again,
haven't you?

16:19.446 --> 16:22.210
Everybody ready?
We'll start off with place of residence...

16:22.382 --> 16:26.113
...and move on to nocturnal visitation...
- That won't be necessary, Your Honor.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.254
- It won't?
- No.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.286
I've decided to step out of the picture.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.861
- Is this going to be a contract or...
- I'm working.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.156
- Then I should just...
- Watch.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.198
What are you saying?

16:41.435 --> 16:44.529
I'm saying I just can't stand
to see you suffer anymore, Nora.

16:44.805 --> 16:46.796
I'll never love anyone
the way I love you...

16:46.974 --> 16:50.000
...but I'd rather give you up
than make your life miserable.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.611
Mitch...

16:53.280 --> 16:54.577
...she's all yours.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.481
- That's real decent of you, Dobie.
- Duane.

16:57.751 --> 16:58.979
Oh, whatever.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.082
You're just giving me up,
just like that?

17:06.460 --> 17:09.020
Yep. Just like that.

17:09.563 --> 17:11.190
How can you do that?

17:11.365 --> 17:13.526
Don't you want to put up
a fight or anything?

17:13.701 --> 17:16.363
Duane is putting up a fight, Nora,
with himself.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.867
Takes a big man to do what he just did.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.367
Doesn't it, Mitch?

17:21.175 --> 17:22.404
Yeah.

17:24.246 --> 17:26.077
Yeah, it does.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.546
You love her that much, huh?

17:29.417 --> 17:30.645
I do.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.082
Yeah...

17:34.656 --> 17:36.556
...I guess you do.

17:38.627 --> 17:41.494
What does this guy do?
Does he stay home a lot or what?

17:41.663 --> 17:44.894
He's pretty much a homebody,
I guess you'd say.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.699
He likes to work around the apartment
in his spare time.

17:49.004 --> 17:50.471
Not like me, huh?

17:51.907 --> 17:53.807
No, not like you.

17:54.109 --> 17:56.475
Yeah, I could never get into
all that stuff...

17:56.845 --> 17:59.177
Fixing windows and puttering
around the house.

17:59.781 --> 18:02.147
Well, it's tough to putter
when you're gone...

18:02.317 --> 18:04.445
...for two and three years
at a stretch.

18:05.555 --> 18:07.022
Never got used to it, huh?

18:09.625 --> 18:10.922
Never.

18:15.798 --> 18:17.095
We'll stay in touch.

18:18.367 --> 18:19.629
Yeah.

18:19.802 --> 18:21.531
We'll stay in touch.

18:22.705 --> 18:25.265
Sir, how did you get them talking?

18:25.474 --> 18:28.773
Easy. I just made an absurd suggestion.

18:29.579 --> 18:30.841
Didn't Solomon do that?

18:31.147 --> 18:33.877
Real short judge,
works the day shift, right?

18:39.522 --> 18:41.183
Good luck to you, old man.

18:43.159 --> 18:44.626
You mean?

18:45.161 --> 18:46.652
You're a lucky guy.

18:47.631 --> 18:49.929
I know. Thanks, Mitch.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.461
But if I ever hear you've been
mistreating her...

18:52.636 --> 18:56.231
Don't be silly. I'm not as stupid as I look.

18:56.406 --> 18:57.668
You're crushing my hand.

19:01.078 --> 19:02.636
Well, judge...

19:03.480 --> 19:04.777
...about those charges...

19:04.948 --> 19:07.382
There are no charges
if nobody's pressing them.

19:07.551 --> 19:09.576
I don't see anybody pressing them.

19:09.753 --> 19:12.415
- Then I can go now?
- Sure. I'll clear it with the DA.

19:12.589 --> 19:14.147
Hey, thanks, judge.

19:15.525 --> 19:17.254
Hey, listen.

19:17.661 --> 19:19.686
I don't wanna sound like a heel...

19:19.863 --> 19:22.331
...but I got this wandering blood
in me, you know...

19:22.766 --> 19:25.030
...and I know I can't
stay home forever.

19:26.436 --> 19:28.371
And most women need the other kind.

19:29.073 --> 19:31.701
You're a pretty big guy
yourself, Mr. Bowers.

19:31.943 --> 19:33.376
Yeah. And I'm also dead, judge.

19:33.611 --> 19:35.704
Right. No identification.

19:35.947 --> 19:38.814
- No records.
- No taxes, no bills.

19:39.183 --> 19:42.050
You should let somebody know.
You've gotta earn a living.

19:42.220 --> 19:45.451
<i>Well, I'm checking the classified
of Soldier of Fortune magazine.</i>

19:45.690 --> 19:47.555
Gotta be a war going on somewhere.

19:48.860 --> 19:50.487
Adios, judge.

19:52.096 --> 19:53.324
Mitch?

19:56.768 --> 19:58.258
Take care.

19:58.569 --> 20:00.036
You too.

20:00.972 --> 20:02.200
I like him.

20:03.374 --> 20:06.537
But if I were you,
I'd tattoo a little personality on him.

20:15.954 --> 20:17.319
Get the idea?

20:25.798 --> 20:27.197
Ready, pumpkin?

20:27.533 --> 20:28.864
All set, Dobie.

20:29.168 --> 20:30.965
- Duane.
- Oh, Duane.

20:34.339 --> 20:35.636
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:35.841 --> 20:37.706
Yes, judge, thank you.

20:38.077 --> 20:39.442
You've been awfully...

20:40.045 --> 20:41.376
Strange.

20:41.547 --> 20:42.878
As long as you know.

20:44.383 --> 20:46.874
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, now.

20:50.622 --> 20:54.616
Oh, sir, you handled that
with great skill.

20:54.794 --> 20:56.318
I just got lucky.

20:58.164 --> 21:00.189
I knew you would.

21:09.075 --> 21:10.474
Oh, hello.

21:11.077 --> 21:13.204
What did I tell you
about this stuff?

21:13.446 --> 21:15.846
I'm sorry. I sent it earlier.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.446
I couldn't stop it.

21:18.384 --> 21:20.443
Don't worry.
I won't bother you anymore.

21:20.754 --> 21:22.415
Don't get depressed on me.

21:22.622 --> 21:24.249
No. I'll be all right. Really.

21:24.424 --> 21:26.153
Come on, Bernie. Chins up.

21:28.528 --> 21:29.790
You know...

21:30.029 --> 21:33.931
...nobody's sent me flowers
in 25 years.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.663
- I can't believe that.
- It's true.

21:37.104 --> 21:39.538
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:39.774 --> 21:42.265
But what you said about relationships...

21:42.443 --> 21:44.206
...living out the golden years...

21:44.512 --> 21:47.072
- Yeah?
- I'm still not interested.

21:48.315 --> 21:49.577
But dinner?

21:50.050 --> 21:52.382
- You'll go with me?
- I'll go with you...

21:52.553 --> 21:55.647
...but no more marriage talk.
- You got it.

21:56.257 --> 22:00.125
But I can't promise that
I won't get affectionate.

22:00.528 --> 22:04.089
Bring a box of Reggie Bars,
and you got a shot.

22:23.518 --> 22:24.951
Here you are, fella.

22:26.488 --> 22:29.616
Well, 18 floors
into a nice, soft mailbag.

22:29.958 --> 22:32.688
You only got eight left, pal.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.958
- Good evening, Your Honor.
- Hi, Liz.

22:36.331 --> 22:38.731
- Dan, how's the nose?
- It's all right.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.834
I figured if I stay off of it a week or so,
it'll heal very nicely. Thank you.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.736
Hi, everybody.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.533
Hi, Selma. How did it go?

22:46.708 --> 22:47.970
How did what go?

22:48.276 --> 22:50.744
Oh, come on, Selma.
Don't keep us all in suspense.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.470
How did the date go with Bernie?

22:52.647 --> 22:53.875
Oh, that.

22:54.049 --> 22:57.280
You don't have to give us all the details.
What time did you get home?

22:57.619 --> 23:00.453
Well, if you must know, very early.

23:00.623 --> 23:02.352
You didn't have a good time?

23:02.525 --> 23:03.787
I didn't say that.

23:03.960 --> 23:08.454
- You said you got home early.
- I got home around midnight.

23:08.965 --> 23:10.796
Bernie got home around noon.

23:13.703 --> 23:15.466
Ready whenever you are.
