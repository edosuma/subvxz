WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.003
Previously on 90210...
Vanessa, we are
not engaged.

00:04.045 --> 00:05.380
Liam, please, Liam! No!

00:05.422 --> 00:07.090
My name is Liam Court.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.300
I've just seen an accident.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.260
I think I've made a mistake.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.720
Max, this whole thing
was her fault.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.972
She's the one who
brought Colin in.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.765
She's the reason
he got access to my phone.

00:14.807 --> 00:15.933
Alec's been conspiring
to break us apart

00:15.975 --> 00:18.853
since the day we got
married-- it's him or me.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.562
MAX:
I'm not firing you.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.939
I'm asking you to resign.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.566
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were both here, hugging.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.151
I told you about
that video I took

00:26.193 --> 00:27.820
from that kid
at the Pop Up, right?

00:27.862 --> 00:29.321
The sex tape?
I'm gonna show it
to Silver

00:29.363 --> 00:30.823
before she does something
she'll regret.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.533
I'm from the studio, uh,
they sent me over

00:32.573 --> 00:33.742
with the latest cut
of the movie.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.911
(cheering)

00:37.454 --> 00:40.207
I really messed up.
I don't even know you anymore.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.709
Look, it's about Dixon.
He has a spinal infection.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.418
He's gonna be in the hospital
for a couple of days.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.839
You drove all the way
to Santa Barbara for me?
Yeah.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.423
DIXON:
After the accident,
the first thing I saw

00:48.465 --> 00:50.509
was you holding my hand
and I knew right then

00:50.551 --> 00:52.761
and there that I didn't deserve
you, so I promised myself

00:52.803 --> 00:54.262
that I would earn
my second chance.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.097
That I would be the man
that you want me to be.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.641
ADRIANNA:
Dixon's had a setback.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.727
I couldn't
tell him.
You still love him?

00:59.768 --> 01:00.644
Maybe.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.312
I can't do this anymore.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.153
Please, please, please.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.291
ADRIANNA:
Oh, my God!

01:23.333 --> 01:26.754
I just got an offer to open up
for Ne-Yo at the Hollywood Bowl.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.880
(gasps)

01:27.922 --> 01:29.381
Are you...

01:29.423 --> 01:31.425
No way!
Way!

01:31.466 --> 01:32.676
That is so awesome.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.553
That's great.
I'm-I'm proud of you.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.514
Thank you. I only have two days
to prepare. I need to

01:37.556 --> 01:39.683
pick out what I'm gonna wear,
rehearse with my choreographer.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.936
I don't know how I'm gonna
pull it all off.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.520
Seriously, I got to go.
Okay.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.609
Wow, that's, uh, that's huge.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.735
Yeah.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.820
I got to get her something
to congratulate her.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.739
Oh, that's sweet.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.115
Just don't mess it up.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.617
What makes you think
I'm gonna mess it up?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.952
Because last time
you got Ade a gift,

01:57.993 --> 01:59.536
it was a house key on a string.

01:59.578 --> 02:00.704
You need
to step it up.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.372
(sighs) Okay, fine.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.665
I'll, uh, step it up.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.336
So, can I borrow $200,000?

02:08.377 --> 02:09.128
What?

02:09.169 --> 02:11.590
It-it's not for Ade's gift.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.841
(clears throat)

02:12.883 --> 02:15.135
I want to start a record label.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.304
Look, I've been thinking
about it a whole lot, okay?

02:17.345 --> 02:19.640
And, uh, practically dying
kind of gives you

02:19.681 --> 02:21.058
a certain outlook on things.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.643
Dixon, you're gonna be okay.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.561
Yeah, I know, eventually,
but I definitely want

02:24.603 --> 02:25.980
to stay connected into music.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.314
That's a lot of money.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.690
Come on, Annie, please?

02:28.732 --> 02:31.026
Look, I'll pay
you back, okay?

02:31.068 --> 02:34.613
I'll even name it "Annie Is the
Best Sister Ever Records."

02:34.655 --> 02:36.115
Please?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
Fine, I'm in as an investor.
Yes!

02:38.199 --> 02:40.535
But you still need
to get Ade a really nice gift

02:40.577 --> 02:42.412
and by nice I mean nothing
that looks like a hamburger

02:42.454 --> 02:43.956
but is actually a telephone.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.291
That's cold.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.964
NAOMI:
Max?

02:52.006 --> 02:53.090
You didn't come
to bed again.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.508
That's seven nights running,

02:54.549 --> 02:57.302
seven perfectly good pieces
of lingerie going to waste.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.929
Hello?

02:58.971 --> 03:00.430
Your sex-deprived wife here.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.933
I'm sorry, honey.
I can't seem to crack

03:02.975 --> 03:05.978
this damn
C plus plus code and...

03:06.020 --> 03:07.813
I didn't realize
what time it was.
Give it to me.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.439
You can't function like this.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.941
I can't function like this.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.776
You need to hire
Alec's replacement.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.987
Alec and I were together
since day one of college.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.238
I can't just bring in
just anyone to replace him.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.033
Plus, I'm up
to my eyeballs in work.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.576
I-I don't know how
I'm supposed to find time

03:21.618 --> 03:22.870
to comb through
all these résumés.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.872
Hold on, let me see.
Let me see.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.248
Oh, well, bad font.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.709
Bad references.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.752
No job history. Oh.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.130
Bingo. See, that
wasn't so hard.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.548
Check this out:
Bryce Woodbridge,

03:34.589 --> 03:37.968
Stanford degree
in computer sciences,

03:38.010 --> 03:39.178
followed by Harvard
business school

03:39.219 --> 03:41.221
and tons of Silicon
Valley experience.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.430
He does look kind of impressive.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.349
He looks impressive...
no, he looks perfect!

03:44.391 --> 03:45.642
He's Alec 2.0.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.644
Bring him into
the office later today,

03:47.686 --> 03:48.770
have a little geek talk
with him,

03:48.812 --> 03:51.106
and ask him when he can start.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.983
Ah, great.

03:53.025 --> 03:57.320
And afterwards, I'll
come by the office

03:57.362 --> 04:00.281
and bring you lunch, and...

04:00.323 --> 04:02.283
oh, you know,

04:02.325 --> 04:03.660
put a smile back on your face.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.829
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.497
Would you like an appetizer?

04:13.087 --> 04:15.047
(phone ringing)

04:15.089 --> 04:17.925
(footsteps approaching)

04:17.966 --> 04:19.927
You better not
be screening my calls.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.847
(sighs) Sorry.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.390
That it was another
sleazy tabloid looking

04:25.432 --> 04:27.434
for a statement on
my infamous sex tape.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.561
(groans) Well, don't worry.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.897
The world's full
of teen moms and Kardashians,

04:31.939 --> 04:34.149
who are just waiting
to steal your thunder.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.735
It'll blow over soon.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.237
Not soon enough.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.738
The phone's ringing
off the hook.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.406
The studio even called
and left a message.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.451
They want to discuss strategies
for dealing with my situation.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.245
I could kill Navid.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.080
I really don't think he meant
for it to turn out like this.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.873
Silver, if you're
here to defend him...
I'm not.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.960
Actually, I'm here
to ask you a favor.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.255
Um, this might
be a little awkward,

04:56.296 --> 04:57.839
so I understand if you say no,

04:57.881 --> 05:01.760
but you've really
been there for me.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.263
I have a meeting with a
fertility specialist today,

05:04.304 --> 05:06.556
and I was wondering
if you would go with me.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.225
But I thought that...

05:08.267 --> 05:09.935
The insemination isn't working.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.561
Everyone else
my age is trying

05:11.603 --> 05:14.064
not to get pregnant
and here I am finding out

05:14.106 --> 05:15.482
that I might not be able to.

05:15.523 --> 05:18.026
Hey, you don't know
that you have a problem.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.821
(sighs) I know.
I just, I'm sorry.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.697
I just,
I don't really think

05:22.739 --> 05:25.117
I could handle another
medical crisis alone.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.619
Well, you don't have
to go alone.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.454
After a week
of dodging questions

05:29.496 --> 05:30.998
about how my ass looks
on YouTube,

05:31.039 --> 05:33.917
a day at the fertility clinic
actually sounds like fun.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.044
Thank you.

05:40.257 --> 05:44.136
CLARA:
Afternoon, Mrs. Clark-Miller.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.930
Clara, call me
Mrs. Miller-Clark.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.474
Can you let Max know
that I am here for lunch?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.434
He'll just be a minute.
He's finishing up an interview.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.936
Can I take your coat?

05:52.978 --> 05:54.771
We should probably
let Max do that.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.440
It's a newlywed thing.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.319
MAX: I would never have thought
of Z-sorting the objects

06:00.359 --> 06:02.988
at the source to simplify
the LOD-- that's genius!

06:03.030 --> 06:04.072
Naomi.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.200
Hey, you're never
gonna believe this.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.576
I think Bryce Woodbridge
is the one.

06:08.618 --> 06:13.332
Fabulous. Hire him, say good-bye
and let's have lunch.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.043
Oh, um, actually Bryce is a her.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.628
She... oh.
Bryce,

06:18.670 --> 06:19.921
this is my wife Naomi.
Oh.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.007
I think thanks
to her that we found

06:22.049 --> 06:24.051
the perfect replacement
for the CEO position.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.219
Well, so nice to meet you.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.304
Nice to meet you, too.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.848
Bryce-- interesting name.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.517
I hate it. Everyone
always thinks I'm a guy.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.436
(laughs)
You're so obviously not.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.315
Bryce and I just had the
most amazing interview.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.650
She-she knew exactly what to
do about our engines slowing

06:40.692 --> 06:42.069
to less than 16 FPS.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.529
It feels like she could jump
right in and we could get at it.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.240
Well, I'm a 100% available.
And I'm super psyched

06:46.281 --> 06:47.615
about taking the next step
with you.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.659
Good, because, uh...

06:49.701 --> 06:51.745
Max has a lot of candidates
that he has to meet

06:51.786 --> 06:54.373
before he makes
a final decision.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.084
It was so nice
meeting you.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.336
We will get back to you.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.713
It's very nice to
meet you, Bryce.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.805
Hi, guys, Jared Eng here of
celebrity news site Just Jared.

07:10.847 --> 07:15.060
Seems action star Liam Court,
of Corporate Invaders fame,

07:15.102 --> 07:16.811
was doing a little invading
of his own this weekend.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.564
His steamy sex tape
is a viral smash hit,

07:19.606 --> 07:21.649
racking up a million hits...

07:40.377 --> 07:43.213
(theme music playing)

07:58.437 --> 08:00.814
Okay, do you want to tell me
what that was about?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.774
Because I got to say,
I thought Bryce was perfect.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.109
I don't know about perfect.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.777
She was adequate and was nice.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.695
I just think you can do better.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.615
You don't want me to pick Bryce
because she's a girl.

08:10.657 --> 08:15.454
(scoffs) I do not have an issue
with you working with a girl.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.580
I would just prefer
if the girl were...

08:17.622 --> 08:20.334
rounder.
Naomi...

08:20.375 --> 08:23.586
Okay, fine, I have a problem
with you working with a girl.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.963
I'm not an idiot, Max.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.508
Bryce is beautiful and smart
and she speaks geek.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.844
You don't put a piece
of meat in front of a dog

08:30.885 --> 08:33.804
and expect it to say, "No,
thanks. I've already eaten."

08:33.847 --> 08:35.307
I'm a very loyal dog.

08:35.349 --> 08:38.018
I know.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.602
I just want
to keep you that way.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.480
And ever since we got married,

08:41.520 --> 08:44.065
we've been in the threesome
from hell and we

08:44.107 --> 08:45.942
just got out
from underneath that,

08:45.984 --> 08:48.195
and I don't want to share you
with someone else.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.447
Naomi, even if it isn't Bryce,

08:50.489 --> 08:51.781
I'm gonna have to find
a business partner.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.074
I can't run this company alone.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.909
I'll do it.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.120
That's never gonna work.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.579
Why not? Max and Naomi?

08:58.621 --> 09:01.082
We can handle anything together.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.625
Ask yourself, how did we pull
off the Phenomi-con presentation

09:02.667 --> 09:03.626
in one night?

09:03.668 --> 09:04.961
Who cracked the code?

09:05.003 --> 09:06.171
I did.
Uh-huh.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.714
And who kept those geeks
going all night long?

09:07.755 --> 09:09.549
You did.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.510
You see? We are great together.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.513
I'll have to figure out the
technical stuff, I know that.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.473
It's not quite that simple.
Why not?

09:16.515 --> 09:18.475
Tell me in one sentence
what Alec did for you.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.352
Alec did a lot more
for this company

09:20.394 --> 09:21.853
than I can put
into one sentence.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.856
I mean, he had vision,
he understood the market.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.107
He knew how to woo investors.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.734
He...
Wooing?

09:27.775 --> 09:29.777
Wooing is my specialty, Max.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.488
I can woo.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.907
(laughs)
We can be great together.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.993
I know it, I know it.
Give me a chance.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.247
Okay, I am swamped

09:40.288 --> 09:41.998
and there's a planeload
of German bankers coming

09:42.040 --> 09:43.208
to town tomorrow.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.501
Think you can handle them?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.878
Ja. Das is gut.
Ich kann es tun.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.132
Okay, well,
let's give it a try.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.468
Yes!

09:53.510 --> 09:55.345
Okay, so, uh,

09:55.387 --> 09:57.638
I didn't need both
you guys here.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.057
It's just a checkup,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.183
I've been taking my pills

10:00.225 --> 10:01.684
and all the pain
is practically gone.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.562
RILEY: You mean the pain
that you lied about until

10:03.603 --> 10:04.645
you collapsed even though

10:04.687 --> 10:06.647
I told you to see
a doctor-- that pain?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.233
I'm sorry but we
just don't trust you

10:08.275 --> 10:10.193
with your own medical care.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.821
Okay, I'm not loving that
you and you are now "we."

10:13.863 --> 10:15.865
It's not cool.
Good news, Dixon.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.451
Your lab results show
the abscess

10:17.492 --> 10:19.702
pressing on your
spinal cord has abated.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.080
And "we" are happy
to hear about that.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.041
DOCTOR:
Unfortunately I'm still worried
about the infection itself.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.960
We still haven't gotten that
under control.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.337
But he's been taking
his antibiotics religiously.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.549
Sometimes antibiotics alone
don't do the trick.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.675
Um, okay, so what do we do now?

10:34.717 --> 10:36.344
I'll prescribe something
stronger

10:36.386 --> 10:38.305
and we'll run more tests
in a couple days.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.681
But if we don't have good news
then, we may have to consider

10:40.723 --> 10:42.976
surgically removing
the infected tissue.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.478
RILEY:
That's doctor talk

10:44.519 --> 10:47.314
for life-saving spinal surgery
which could result

10:47.355 --> 10:49.190
in cord damage
and permanent paralysis.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.484
There's no reason
to sugarcoat this.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.110
Are you-are you serious?

10:52.152 --> 10:54.446
The surgery does have
inherent risks.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.323
Well, there has to be an option
other than risky surgery.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.616
RILEY: You'd rather Dixon
take a chance

10:57.657 --> 10:59.993
of dying of
an infection?

11:00.034 --> 11:01.869
Riley,
permanent paralysis is...
Sexy?

11:01.911 --> 11:05.039
No, no, no, dude,
it's permanent!

11:05.081 --> 11:07.250
Look, I understand
being in a wheelchair

11:07.292 --> 11:08.835
isn't the end of the world,

11:08.876 --> 11:10.337
but it's not what
I was hoping for.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.088
I thought I was
getting my life back.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.672
DOCTOR: Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

11:13.714 --> 11:17.010
We need the meds to do
their thing and then we'll see.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.220
Okay?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.186
Liam!
Hey, you,
look over here!

11:26.227 --> 11:27.895
You got to be
kidding me.
Just go, Liam.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.730
So, Liam, is this girl
having your love child?

11:29.772 --> 11:31.650
Or don't you got the sauce
to make it happen?

11:31.690 --> 11:32.859
Ignore them, okay?
Don't take the bait.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.402
Hey, honey,
are you Liam's new girl?

11:34.444 --> 11:35.945
Hey, this is personal.
You mind backing off?

11:35.987 --> 11:37.614
Backing off?
In case you didn't know,

11:37.656 --> 11:39.157
you're Hollywood's
latest bad boy.
Let's go.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.701
Remember, you can run
but you can't hide.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.454
What'd you say?

11:44.496 --> 11:45.872
You heard me.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.003
What the hell?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.004
You smashed my camera!

11:53.046 --> 11:54.172
You come around again,
it's gonna be

11:54.214 --> 11:55.549
more than your camera
that gets smashed!

12:05.933 --> 12:08.936
Okay, now, this is
what I meant by a gift.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.022
Man, am I glad
Naomi set us up

12:11.064 --> 12:13.191
with this private
showing, Mr. Lane.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.150
Uh, Naomi, she's great.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.485
She's been a client
for years.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.944
You can call me Neil.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.198
Those earrings are beautiful!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.740
DIXON:
You think so?

12:21.782 --> 12:23.117
I can't decide.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.036
Well, the necklaces
are obviously gorgeous, too,

12:25.078 --> 12:28.081
but don't you think they might
be saying "I'm trying too hard?"

12:28.122 --> 12:30.791
Maybe I'm not
trying hard enough.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.712
Uh, Mr. Lane--
uh, Neil,

12:33.752 --> 12:34.795
you wouldn't happen to have

12:34.837 --> 12:36.548
any, uh, engagement rings,
would you?

12:36.590 --> 12:38.007
What?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.133
Uh, I didn't bring any.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.218
I didn't know

12:40.260 --> 12:41.595
you were looking for
an engagement ring.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.637
But I can get you some.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.680
I'll call my assistant.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.932
I'll be right back.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.892
Dixon, what are you doing?!

12:47.934 --> 12:50.228
Um, look, I've been
thinking about it a lot,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.731
and I can't imagine
my life without Ade.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.065
But marriage?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.567
Dixon, you are not
ready for that.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.402
Ade isn't ready for that.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.613
Look, if this is because of
what the doctor said...

12:59.654 --> 13:00.988
Then what?

13:01.030 --> 13:04.409
Look, I'm about to go through
a serious change in my life.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.493
Okay?

13:05.535 --> 13:07.287
I think this is
exactly the right time

13:07.328 --> 13:09.247
where I need to start
thinking about my future

13:09.289 --> 13:10.749
and what I
really want.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.710
But what about what Ade wants?

13:13.752 --> 13:16.504
Dixon, if you ask her
to marry you before you know

13:16.546 --> 13:19.006
how things are going to work out
with your recovery,

13:19.048 --> 13:20.717
you're asking a lot of her.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.927
It didn't stop you
from dating Riley.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.763
Dating isn't marriage.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.556
And I knew about
Riley's condition

13:26.598 --> 13:28.057
before everything started.
It's...

13:28.099 --> 13:29.934
Look, if you care
about somebody,

13:29.976 --> 13:31.894
then you learn to
deal with it, right?

13:33.062 --> 13:36.190
I love her, Annie.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.485
And, look, you're the only
person I'm telling about this,

13:38.526 --> 13:39.818
so you got
to promise me

13:39.860 --> 13:41.529
that you won't say
anything to anyone.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.658
Okay?

13:44.699 --> 13:45.908
Fine.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.120
Thank you.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.414
So, we'll be moving you
to an IVF protocol.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.957
What exactly is that?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.959
You'll be getting
a daily estrogen shot.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.586
That will stimulate
your egg production,

13:56.628 --> 13:59.255
and if you tolerate it well,
will allow us to harvest

13:59.297 --> 14:01.132
your eggs and create
viable embryos.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.925
What do you mean,
if she tolerates it well?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.135
Is this safe?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.221
There can be some side effects,
but they're rare.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.599
I'll give you some literature so
you know what to look out for.

14:09.641 --> 14:13.144
What are my chances
of actually getting pregnant?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.938
Thousands of women go through
this procedure every year

14:15.980 --> 14:17.398
and have normal,
healthy babies.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.525
You're young and fit.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.901
You have an excellent prognosis.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.158
Okay. Let's get started.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.206
No offense, but
this seems like

14:33.247 --> 14:36.543
the least fun way to
get pregnant ever.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.044
Liam, let's just go.
I don't want any more trouble.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.504
It's fine, it's fine.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.548
I just want to make sure they
throw the book at this parasite.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.465
Morning, officers.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.719
Yeah.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.430
What?

14:49.472 --> 14:50.473
All right,

14:50.515 --> 14:51.641
there's got to be
some kind of mistake.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.267
This is, this is crazy.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.478
(camera shutter clicking)

15:07.031 --> 15:08.032
What is all this?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.534
Oh, my God,
honey, the feng shui

15:09.576 --> 15:10.702

was so wrong.

I'm not here to arrest you;
I'm here to protect you.

Protect me?
The studio is sympathetic to
what you've been going through.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.278
So they've assigned me
as your security detail.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.323
No offense, but, uh, I
can take care of myself,

17:54.365 --> 17:55.825

Really?

going so far?

17:57.493 --> 17:58.828
I'm sorry, is this funny to you?

17:58.870 --> 18:02.373
No. No. In fact, I take
your security very seriously.

with thousands of fans

18:05.835 --> 18:07.294

that photographer,

18:08.713 --> 18:10.506
the media's gonna be
all over you.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.008
So you can refuse
the security detail if you want

worse before they get better.

from here, Liam,

26:29.338 --> 26:31.131
but, uh, once we get inside,
I'll be close by

26:31.173 --> 26:32.299
in case you need anything, okay?
Okay.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.801
Actually, uh, I guess
I have an extra ticket.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.011
You want to sit with us?

26:36.053 --> 26:38.264
Sure. That would be great.
Thanks.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.560
Since when did you
have a bodyguard?

26:42.600 --> 26:43.894
She's not a bodyguard.

26:43.936 --> 26:47.398
She is from the studio
to keep away the paparazzi.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.192
From your body...
by guarding it?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.486
I hate you.
(laughs)

26:52.528 --> 26:53.571
(phone chimes)

26:53.611 --> 26:55.613
Oh, my gosh,
I can't freaking believe it!

26:55.655 --> 26:57.157
Look at what Riley just sent me.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.701
"I forgot. Not gonna make it?"

26:59.743 --> 27:01.036
What's that about?

27:01.078 --> 27:02.871
It means it's my
turn to get angry.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.664
Look, tell Ade that
I'm really sorry.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.832
Got to go.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.126

ADRIANNA:
Thank you,

28:15.068 --> 28:16.487
Los Angeles!

28:16.529 --> 28:18.947
(applause and cheering)

28:23.076 --> 28:25.287
That was amazing!

28:25.329 --> 28:27.122
Yeah. No, you're amazing.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.999
(both moaning)

28:29.041 --> 28:30.834
Mmm.
Mmm. Do you hear
the people out there?

28:30.876 --> 28:33.671
Yes.
They love you, okay?
And I love you.

28:33.711 --> 28:37.007
(laughs)
Which is why,
um... (sighs)...

28:37.049 --> 28:39.259
I have something
I want to ask you.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.136
(sighs)

28:41.178 --> 28:43.222
(laughs softly)

28:49.562 --> 28:52.356
Dixon, before you do this,
I have to tell you something.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.566
What?

28:53.607 --> 28:55.234
(gasps)
He's proposing!

28:55.984 --> 28:57.444
Oh! Oh!

28:57.486 --> 28:59.405
Uh... uh,

28:59.446 --> 29:00.989
guy, guys, guys,
guys, guys!

29:01.031 --> 29:02.575
It's not a ring. (laughs)

29:02.616 --> 29:04.826
Babe, it's-it's
not a ring.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.120
(sighs)

29:07.162 --> 29:08.955
Wait. I don't understand.
I thought

29:08.997 --> 29:10.082
you were going to...

29:10.123 --> 29:13.293
No, no. Um...
(clears throat) Look,

29:13.335 --> 29:14.836
the other day, the
doctors told me

29:14.878 --> 29:16.338
that I was gonna
need a surgery

29:16.380 --> 29:20.008
to clear my infection,
and if I got my surgery,

29:20.050 --> 29:23.095
I probably would never
fully recover.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.763
Dixon...

29:24.804 --> 29:26.806
And all I thought about
was not losing you.

29:26.848 --> 29:30.936
But then today, I
got some good news,

29:30.977 --> 29:33.397
and all I could think about was
telling you.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.899
And that's when
it hit me.

29:35.941 --> 29:39.903
All I think about is you.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.073
Music used to be the only
important thing in my life, but

29:43.115 --> 29:44.533
not anymore.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.577
It's you.

29:46.619 --> 29:49.329
So, um...

29:50.623 --> 29:52.750
Here.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.168
Oh.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.463
Wow. (laughs)

29:57.504 --> 30:00.090
Oh.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.341
Yeah. Um,

30:01.383 --> 30:03.843
I know neither one of us
are ready to get married.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.972
But, um...

30:07.013 --> 30:08.599
I'm starting a recording label,

30:08.641 --> 30:11.851
and I want you to be
the first artist that I sign.

30:11.893 --> 30:12.811
Really?

30:12.852 --> 30:15.063
Yes.
(laughs)

30:15.105 --> 30:17.232
I want to be with you
in life and in business.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.738
Adrianna...
you're my everything.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.408
Please say yes.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.952
They're beautiful.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.036
Yes?

30:30.078 --> 30:31.371
Yes!

30:31.413 --> 30:32.872
Yes, yes.

30:32.914 --> 30:33.749
Mmm.

30:33.791 --> 30:36.209
(whoops and applause)

30:36.251 --> 30:38.462
Yes.
(laughs)

30:38.504 --> 30:40.005
ADRIANNA:
Cheers!

30:40.046 --> 30:42.466
(whoops, then laughs)

30:42.508 --> 30:45.678
Okay. Let's go, guys.
We're missing Ne-Yo.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.763
Oh.
Yeah.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.893
Hey, what's wrong
with your leg?

30:53.935 --> 30:55.395
I don't know.
It's just aching a bit.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.980
Isn't that one of the
symptoms they listed

30:57.022 --> 30:58.398
in the pamphlets
the doctor gave us?

30:58.440 --> 30:59.650
I don't know.

30:59.692 --> 31:00.818
Should I call my doctor?

31:00.859 --> 31:03.195
(sighs)
They said it could be serious.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.404
I think to be sure,

31:04.446 --> 31:05.489
we should go to the ER.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.240
Lights and a siren will
get us there faster.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.743
Come on.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.830
For a non-proposal,
that was pretty romantic.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.915
Dixon always
knows what to say.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.334
I'm glad you're my everything.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.836
Except I'm not.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.714
Who was the other person?

31:21.755 --> 31:23.256
The other...?
What other person?

31:23.298 --> 31:25.884
The other person who knew the
answer to the goldfish question.

31:25.925 --> 31:27.302
Who was it?

31:27.344 --> 31:30.096
It was Alec.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.852
Okay.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.811
Okay?

31:35.853 --> 31:39.314
I'll be right back.
What?

31:39.356 --> 31:43.694
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Los Angeles, California, put
your hands together for Ne-Yo.

What the hell?

33:35.681 --> 33:36.974
Annie, hey.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.434
Ah, the concert.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.478
I, uh, totally forgot.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.021
I'm sorry, I just--
it got late,

33:43.062 --> 33:45.816
and then I couldn't
get myself together.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.025
So you stood me up?

33:47.066 --> 33:49.528
Pretty much, yeah.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.739
Why are you
doing this?

33:52.781 --> 33:54.741
I don't know, I'm just treating
you like any other girl

33:54.783 --> 33:55.993
I'm not sure
I want to keep dating.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.661
Oh, you're not sure
you want to date me?

33:57.703 --> 33:59.997
Yeah, it's a big shock, right?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.373
I mean, a guy in a wheelchair

34:01.414 --> 34:03.542
should just be falling
all over himself

34:03.583 --> 34:05.293
to date you, right?
That is,

34:05.335 --> 34:07.253
when he's not falling
all over himself

34:07.295 --> 34:09.882
'cause he can't walk, which is
a fate worse than death, huh?

34:09.922 --> 34:10.799
I never said that.

34:10.841 --> 34:11.717
You kind of did--

34:11.757 --> 34:14.302
first to Dixon
and then to me.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.469
You know, you're not
doing me any favors,

34:15.512 --> 34:16.763
even though you
act like you are.

34:16.804 --> 34:17.931
That is so unfair.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.433
You can't blame me
for caring about my brother

34:20.475 --> 34:21.726
or for trying to help.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.855
Yeah, I can, Annie, because
I don't need your help.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.360
I know we just
started dating,

34:31.402 --> 34:33.362
but the truth is,
if this actually goes somewhere,

34:33.405 --> 34:35.156
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do

34:35.197 --> 34:37.324
or how this is supposed to work.

34:39.284 --> 34:41.161
Okay.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.373
Why don't you start by
telling me what you'd do

34:43.415 --> 34:45.083
to a guy who stood you up?

34:51.297 --> 34:54.132
That's more like it.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.849
(screams)

35:02.601 --> 35:04.978
What are you doing?

35:05.020 --> 35:09.315
Annie, my life didn't end
when I stopped walking,

35:09.357 --> 35:10.901
and I'm sorry,
but it didn't start again

35:10.943 --> 35:12.193
the minute I met you.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.284
I like you, I do.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.787
I need you to treat me
like any other guy.

35:21.828 --> 35:22.829
(sighs)

35:22.871 --> 35:25.290
You do that?

35:27.084 --> 35:29.168
You mean like this?

35:49.022 --> 35:51.441
You okay?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.151
Yeah, thanks to you.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.821
I should have known
something was wrong.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.031
Ah, we're just lucky that
I noticed the symptoms.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.699
What'd the doctor say?

35:59.741 --> 36:01.994
Turns out I have a condition

36:02.035 --> 36:05.246
called hyperstimulation
syndrome,

36:05.288 --> 36:07.165
which caused
a blood clot in my leg.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.292
They put me on blood thinners

36:09.334 --> 36:12.838
and now they have
to harvest my eggs.

36:12.879 --> 36:16.675
Okay, so that's
good, right?

36:16.716 --> 36:20.512
I guess, but I'm not gonna be
able to do this again

36:20.553 --> 36:24.390
because it's too dangerous,
so...

36:24.432 --> 36:28.311
...this is kind of my one shot
at having a baby.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.439
Just this one.

Naomi?

36:55.047 --> 36:57.549

Max promoted from within.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.930
Yeah, his wife.

guys instantly hit it off,

realized

37:14.691 --> 37:18.070
that, as much as I want to,
I can't be everything to Max.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.113
Don't take the job
with the start-up.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.656
You're the perfect
candidate.

37:21.698 --> 37:22.949
Max needs you.

37:22.991 --> 37:26.244
Well, it turns out I haven't
said yes to the start-up.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.829
So that means...

37:27.871 --> 37:29.998
I'll come work for Max.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.875
Thank you.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.174
It wouldn't kill you
to wear pantsuits.

Hey, I just got an e-mail
from Bryce Woodbridge,

38:26.138 --> 38:28.056
thanking me for hiring
her as the new CEO.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.849
You want to explain
to me what's going on?

38:29.891 --> 38:34.353
What's going on is...

38:34.395 --> 38:35.814
I want you to be happy,

38:35.855 --> 38:38.566
and maybe you can't be
happy without Alec

38:38.608 --> 38:40.819
or at least someone
who's not pure evil

38:40.860 --> 38:42.695

business enough to spark

38:42.737 --> 38:45.531
your creativity
and not just redecorate

38:45.573 --> 38:47.909
and dazzle people
at lunch.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.119
If I can't make it work

38:49.161 --> 38:52.247
with someone like that
in your life,

38:52.289 --> 38:54.124
we don't stand
a chance.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.626
I love you.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.504
For the record,

I was about to propose?

39:34.873 --> 39:36.041
Uh, yes.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.302
I don't know.

I was just so freaked out
and it was such a surprise,

39:52.349 --> 39:55.352

was perfect.
