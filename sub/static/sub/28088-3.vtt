ALL LAUGH

00:30.340 --> 00:32.659
What's going on here?

00:32.659 --> 00:34.860
This is magic. Wait till you see
this.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.540
Right, come on. Do me.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.460
6'1". 14st on the button.

00:40.460 --> 00:43.580
42 chest. 11 in a shoe.

00:43.580 --> 00:48.220
CHUCKLES: That's me fitted for my
coffin. The old wooden overcoat.

00:48.220 --> 00:50.190
No measuring tape. No nothing.

00:50.190 --> 00:53.350
And I've to get a cheaper coffin,
cos I'm that wee bit wee-er.

00:53.350 --> 00:55.710
Do Meena now.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.350
This'll be the most expensive coffin
in Craiglang, huh?

00:58.350 --> 01:00.510
They'll need eight wrestlers to
carry it!

01:00.510 --> 01:02.590
SHE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE

01:02.590 --> 01:03.910
Aww.

01:05.710 --> 01:09.230
Actually, Mrs Drennan,
it was you I came in to see.

01:09.230 --> 01:13.400
Oh, no, no. Oh, I don't want
to play your deid-body coffin game.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.880
No, no, I just want to see

01:14.880 --> 01:17.040
if I could get you to come in
and do a bit of cleaning.

01:17.040 --> 01:22.560
Ooh. Cleaning down dead bodies
in preparation for the afterlife.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.840
Because the big man upstairs

01:24.840 --> 01:27.640
does not like to receive a dirty
body.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.800
SNIFFS: "Ooh, down to hell,
you dirty, stinky, manky corpse!"

01:33.800 --> 01:38.610
"We cannae have you honkin' the
place out! Get back down the
escalator!"

01:38.610 --> 01:40.850
Gentlemen, please.

01:40.850 --> 01:44.690
Just after I close, come in
and do a bit of dusting, polishing.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.330
Cash, of course.

01:47.770 --> 01:50.530
Oh, yes, Mr Sheathing.

01:50.530 --> 01:52.850
Lovely.
Deal!

01:52.850 --> 01:54.610
Oh! Oh!

01:56.290 --> 01:57.530
Deal!

02:03.980 --> 02:07.100
LAUGHTER

02:07.100 --> 02:10.139
He's a right good laugh,
this fella, isn't he?

02:10.139 --> 02:13.620
You always get hit wi'
a good bit of patter when you go in.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.140
Aye, I'll give him that - he's
funny.

02:18.140 --> 02:20.780
Have you no' got
your own magazine to read?

02:20.780 --> 02:23.140
There's a Pokenose Monthly
lying over there.

02:23.140 --> 02:26.620
Oh, sorry, son.
It looks good, but, doesn't it?

02:26.620 --> 02:28.590
What does?
Water-skiing.

02:28.590 --> 02:30.510
Are you thinking of taking it up?

02:30.510 --> 02:32.150
Oh, let's see.

02:32.150 --> 02:36.310
76, red face, pot belly, one leg,

02:36.310 --> 02:38.630
and it's difficult to hold a pint
when you're on it,

02:38.630 --> 02:41.830
so it'll no' be this year.
So, you've only got the one leg?

02:41.830 --> 02:43.790
Still, you shouldnae let that
hold you back.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.990
I've seen boys on the telly
doing it one leg.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.590
Spinning, tricks and that, you know.

02:48.590 --> 02:50.720
Mono-boarding, they call it.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.960
You're mono-boring me. I'm no'
interested.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.960
Oh, sorry, son. I cannae help
myself.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.920
There's all sorts wrong wi' me.
I take tablets for everything.

02:58.920 --> 03:03.040
I take 24 tablets in the morning

03:03.040 --> 03:05.560
and then 36 tablets at various times
throughout the day.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.240
Listen here, you old prick!

03:08.240 --> 03:11.960
It'll be a bit tickly and mad itchy,
but it's healing up.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.680
I don't mind a wee bit of tickly,
Doctor.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.040
Stop that now!

03:17.040 --> 03:18.210
Mr Ingram.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.130
Oh, look who it is -
Lennon and McCartney.

03:27.130 --> 03:30.250
We'll boot you right in
the Ringo Starrfish.

03:30.250 --> 03:33.210
Two pints, you Pete Best prick!

03:34.970 --> 03:36.570
No Tam, no Winston?

03:36.570 --> 03:38.450
Was Winston no' up at the doctor's?

03:38.450 --> 03:40.210
Was he? What's wrong with him?

03:40.210 --> 03:44.580
I don't know. A suspected burst
coupon.

03:47.220 --> 03:50.340
Goldie, please, Boabby.
What happened there?

03:50.340 --> 03:52.660
I'm gonnae throw this
in the skip behind Navid's.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.620
Cat's jumped up and knocked it down.

03:54.620 --> 03:57.420
Destroyed. Bastard.

04:06.150 --> 04:08.310
Cash.

04:08.310 --> 04:12.550
See, the thing is, my Frances,
she's distraught.

04:12.550 --> 04:16.910
Sorry to hear that.
Money for the goldie.

04:16.910 --> 04:18.709
Aye, she's gonnae miss her

04:18.709 --> 04:21.950
programmes - EastEnders, The Cakey
Bake Off...

04:23.630 --> 04:25.150
...Blue Planet.

04:25.150 --> 04:27.510
Oh, she loves the dolphins!

04:27.510 --> 04:29.630
She's dolphin daft.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.750
And the porpoises

04:31.750 --> 04:34.800
and the mollus...molluskerus.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.960
Shellfish.

04:37.480 --> 04:41.120
She's heartbroken, Boabby.
It's hard to watch.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.360
Bit like this telly.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.040
Right.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.890
Do you know what else
she likes to watch?

05:00.890 --> 05:02.290
Would I Lie To You?.

05:04.930 --> 05:08.170
I'm no' taking this to the skip.
I've just taken it out the skip.

05:08.170 --> 05:09.810
It's the same make as my own.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.010
Take it up the road,
I lie it flat down on the carpet,

05:13.010 --> 05:15.970
call the insurance - 400 quid, boom!

05:18.770 --> 05:21.810
I just hope the insurance guy's
as gullible a wanker as you, Boabby.

05:21.810 --> 05:25.060
OK, Tam, that's it.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.540
I'm no' responsible
for what's about to happen.

05:27.540 --> 05:28.860
As much as it pains me,

05:28.860 --> 05:31.700
what with only having
six regular customers,

05:31.700 --> 05:34.140
the time has come.

05:34.140 --> 05:37.540
Does Frances watch The Apprentice?

05:37.540 --> 05:38.860
Cos you're barred.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.900
Do you no' mean "fired"?

05:41.900 --> 05:47.230
Aye. Er, no, barred,
you miserable bastard.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.910
Oh, that was good!

05:55.910 --> 05:59.030
You were having a right good
carry-on wi' her, Doctor.

05:59.030 --> 06:01.990
Aye, aye, she's a scream.
Nothing gets her down.

06:01.990 --> 06:05.310
All my patients are a good laugh.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.550
There's not a day
I don't love coming in here.

06:07.550 --> 06:09.920
Ho-ho! What a hoot you get.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.040
Now, your other leg's
going to have to come off.

06:15.040 --> 06:20.440
Aye, good. Good one.
You're murder, you.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.080
It's true.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.400
ISA: Oh, Isa, hen, what have you
done?

06:30.840 --> 06:32.400
"Cash, of course."

06:32.400 --> 06:35.360
"Oh, yes, Mr Sheathing. Lovely."

06:39.210 --> 06:41.410
Right, enough!

06:43.050 --> 06:45.690
BANGING

06:48.810 --> 06:51.450
Oh! Oh!

07:03.060 --> 07:07.940
SCREAMS: Oh! Oh!

07:08.900 --> 07:11.140

MUSIC STOPS

07:40.190 --> 07:43.590
Cleaning a funeral home, by Christ!

07:43.590 --> 07:45.270
It's my knickers that'll need

07:45.270 --> 07:47.270
cleaning by the time I get up the
road.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.440
Ah, Winston, I'm sorry.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.040
Cup of tea?
No, you sit down.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.480
I'll make a cup of tea.
Plenty of time for sitting down.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.080
I'll be sitting down
for the rest of my bastardin' life.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.840
So, what did they say?

08:03.840 --> 08:05.080
WINSTON SIGHS

08:05.080 --> 08:08.160
I stopped listening after
"gangrene".

08:08.160 --> 08:10.960
He'd been sending me these letters
every fortnight for the last

08:10.960 --> 08:13.120
three months, and I just ignored
them.

08:13.120 --> 08:17.330
Was that wise? No, Jack. It was the
opposite of wise.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.170
It was wise-less.

08:19.170 --> 08:21.610
And there's nothing they can do?

08:21.610 --> 08:25.810
The amputation policy
is to catch it early.

08:25.810 --> 08:28.250
Toe before foot. Foot before leg.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.050
If I'd left those letters any

08:30.050 --> 08:32.970
longer, it would have been leg
before arsehole,

08:32.970 --> 08:38.049
arsehole before tits,
tits before heid, heid before
coffin,

08:38.049 --> 08:40.299
so I'm lucky, really.

08:40.299 --> 08:41.539
No way round about it?

08:41.539 --> 08:44.900
No' unless you're a millionaire
and you can get to Switzerland.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.460
Unless you're John Paul Getty.
Did he have rotten legs?

08:48.460 --> 08:51.700
That's right. He had a nickname.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.780
"John Paul Getty, legs like
spaghetti." He was a millionaire!

08:54.780 --> 08:56.540
Oh, aye. Sorry.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.540
Right, we promise you this -

08:58.540 --> 09:00.420
there'll be no more jokes

09:00.420 --> 09:02.180
about Hopalong Cassidy,

09:02.180 --> 09:04.430
or stumpin' up for a drink,

09:04.430 --> 09:06.510
or My Left Foot,

09:06.510 --> 09:08.790
or Long John Silver,

09:08.790 --> 09:11.150
or don't step on my blue suede
shoe...

09:11.150 --> 09:13.830
That's plenty, Jack.
Oh.

09:13.830 --> 09:17.630
Listen, I knew this day was coming,

09:17.630 --> 09:21.190
but I can take anything
that life throws at me.

09:21.190 --> 09:25.150
I'm still Winston,
and I can still take a joke.

09:25.150 --> 09:26.830
I'm no' gonnae be a victim.

09:28.030 --> 09:30.840
So, I want you to keep 'em coming.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.760
Right. We hear you.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.360
What are yous up to the day?

09:35.360 --> 09:38.400
Nothing. We're just, erm... Ooh.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.760
Ah, now, see?
That's what I'm talking about.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.280
None of that pish. Get it said.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.320
Well, we're no' up to anything.
We're just...arseing about.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.000
Arseing about. Funny.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.080
ALL CHUCKLE

09:52.080 --> 09:53.570
Very good.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.170
Right, I'll see yous later on.

10:04.610 --> 10:05.850
Aye.

10:07.450 --> 10:08.690
Funny.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.650
Jack. Victor.

10:11.650 --> 10:13.170
Hello, Navid.

10:14.290 --> 10:16.170
Hello, Tam.
Jack. Victor.

10:16.170 --> 10:18.010
Erm, have you heard about Winston?

10:18.010 --> 10:19.690
Aye, I did indeed.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.260
Rotten business.
You know an' all?

10:22.260 --> 10:25.740
Gentlemen, sometimes I think that
you wilfully forget who's in my
employ.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.140
Isa?

10:28.420 --> 10:31.500
My pal Christine's
the receptionist at the surgery.

10:31.500 --> 10:36.020
While Winston was in the waiting
room, she'd called me to tell me.

10:36.020 --> 10:39.180
So, not only do I know,
but I knew before the information

10:39.180 --> 10:41.460
had crossed the desk and hit
Winston.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.420
Terrible business.

10:46.430 --> 10:49.470
Here's the thing, Navid.
Here's our dilemma.

10:49.470 --> 10:52.070
He disnae want us
to treat him any differently.

10:52.070 --> 10:55.870
And rightly so. Your relationship is
born out of banter,

10:55.870 --> 10:58.710
badinage...persiflage, if you will.

10:58.710 --> 11:03.150
You fling insults at one another
like monkeys flinging shite at the
zoo,

11:03.150 --> 11:08.240
and if you stop that,
he'll...not have shite on him,

11:08.240 --> 11:10.280
and he disnae want that because...

11:10.280 --> 11:11.760
Och, you know what I mean.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.320
Aye, we get what you're saying,

11:13.320 --> 11:15.160
but we're just gonnae
have to band together

11:15.160 --> 11:18.000
and try and make his life a bit
easier. Agreed.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.480
We're gonnae speak to Boabby
about us building a ramp at
The Clansman.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.120
BOTH LAUGH
Mocked by the beads.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.840
Shut up, Meena.

11:28.840 --> 11:32.080
That's a great idea. I might build a
ramp.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.250
You don't need one. You're on the
level. No, for Meena. A ramp
into the van.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.490
It would help get the bastard into
it.

11:41.410 --> 11:45.250
Hey, where are you off to, boys?
Clansman.

11:45.250 --> 11:49.930
Oh, no, no, stay here a bit longer.
We'll have a catch-up.

11:52.610 --> 11:56.010
So, there's nothing can be done
to save his leg, no?

11:56.010 --> 11:59.860
No' without a tonne of money and,
well, Winston's no' got two bob, has
he?

11:59.860 --> 12:01.380
What the hell are you doing?

12:01.380 --> 12:04.260
I was gonnae pay for them!
Get out! You're barred!

12:11.220 --> 12:12.860
CREAKING

MUSIC PLAYS ON HEADPHONES

ISA SCREAMS

12:30.430 --> 12:33.190
Oh! Oh!

12:36.830 --> 12:40.510
So, Boabby, are we going to get
a green light on this ramp, or what?

12:40.510 --> 12:43.790
Let me phone somebody. I don't think
you know what you're doing.

12:43.790 --> 12:49.120
Why don't you stick to pulling
pints, and we'll stick with the
proper graft?

12:49.120 --> 12:52.720
Ha!
That's a laugh - proper graft.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.840
Try doing a late-night shift
at that creepy bastard's parlour.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.320
Oh, Isa, please.
See, it's all in the planning.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.600
This here is a shoring mould.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.440
It's called shoring, Boabby.

13:05.440 --> 13:09.640
I know all about shoring.
Well, what is it, then?

13:09.640 --> 13:12.810
Well, after a day's sailing,
a boat comes in and goes,

13:12.810 --> 13:15.210
"Right, there's the shore."

13:15.210 --> 13:21.850
And the boat comes in to...the shore
and goes up...the ramp.

13:21.850 --> 13:24.570
We're no' talking about
the Royal Yacht Britannica, Boabby.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.770
It's for a wheelchair.

13:25.770 --> 13:27.090
Britannia, Jack.

13:27.090 --> 13:29.450
Eh? What did I say?
"Britannica".

13:29.450 --> 13:33.010
You just described
a floating encyclopaedia.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.930
How much is this gonnae cost?

13:35.930 --> 13:37.370
Jack?

13:37.370 --> 13:39.860
Eh? Oh, erm, not a curdy.

13:39.860 --> 13:43.580
No, they're building a new block of
flats at the bottom of the road as
we speak.

13:43.580 --> 13:46.100
Now, myself, Victor and Shug
will saunter down there

13:46.100 --> 13:48.380
and explain to the foreman
our friend's situation

13:48.380 --> 13:52.780
and that will appeal
to his charitable side.

13:52.780 --> 13:55.620
ALL LAUGH

13:55.620 --> 13:58.060
Free cement?
Listen to these old roasters!

13:58.060 --> 13:59.220
Get to f...

13:59.220 --> 14:00.580
400.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.140
Oh, Jesus! Naw.

14:03.580 --> 14:07.310
Och, all right, fine.
It's for a good cause.

14:07.310 --> 14:09.510
THEY CELEBRATE QUIETLY

14:09.510 --> 14:12.070
Erm, can we get three pints, Boabby?

14:12.070 --> 14:14.790
It's thirsty work
thinking about building ramps.

14:14.790 --> 14:17.750
Fine. Then get to work.

14:21.670 --> 14:24.590
Tam. Isa.

14:24.590 --> 14:27.390
Where are you headed?
Nowhere.

14:27.390 --> 14:30.000
Cannae go into The Clansman.
Cannae go into Navid's.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
I've been walking about Craiglang
like a bastardin' security guard.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Even caught myself swinging
my house keys earlier, like this.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.960
Aye, must be nice, that -
walking about,

14:43.960 --> 14:45.320
on your legs,

14:45.320 --> 14:47.800
which is more than Winston'll be
doing in a few weeks.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.720
I'm no' avoiding him, Isa.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.000
In fact, I was gonnae drop by and
see him

14:52.000 --> 14:54.610
once I'd stopped
walking about...aimlessly.

14:54.610 --> 14:58.770
Aye. Well, why don't you take a walk
up tae the bookie's and get barred
fae there?

14:58.770 --> 15:01.890
Or take a walk up to the park
and maybe get barred fae there?

15:01.890 --> 15:04.250
Or take a walk up and see your
bloody pal?

15:04.250 --> 15:09.690
OK! I'll admit it - it's awkward.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.290
I mean, what do you say?

15:11.290 --> 15:14.570
If he's gonnae talk honestly to
anybody, it's gonnae be to you.

15:14.570 --> 15:17.410
He disnae want sympathy.

15:17.410 --> 15:19.860
He needs his best pal.

15:19.860 --> 15:23.060
You go up and just be yourself.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.900
No kid gloves. Just be Tam.

15:27.980 --> 15:30.100
Thanks, Isa.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.940
Tam. What?

15:33.940 --> 15:36.260
Winston's house is up there.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.020
Aye, of course it is. That way.

15:43.140 --> 15:47.230
ISA: Just be yourself. Just be Tam.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.430
Well, I suppose, on the up side,
your invalidity benefit's gonnae
jump up.

15:54.430 --> 15:56.630
I'm no' gonnae be doing
any jumping up, am I?

15:56.630 --> 15:57.950
No. Sorry.

15:59.390 --> 16:01.830
Here, I could teach you chess

16:01.830 --> 16:03.830
and we could go down to the park
on a Sunday

16:03.830 --> 16:06.670
and fleece those daft old bastards
that play. We'd make a fortune.

16:06.670 --> 16:09.920
So, you're saying to me
that this wheelchair

16:09.920 --> 16:12.560
is gonnae give me an opportunity
to make money?

16:13.880 --> 16:16.600
I'm no' gonnae need a fortune then.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.720
I'm gonnae need a fortune now
to get a specialist to save my leg.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.560
Right, OK, I was thinking -

16:25.560 --> 16:28.520
remember that pair of lovely brogues
you bought last year?

16:29.720 --> 16:31.210
Yes.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.490
Can I get them?
You'll no' be needing them.

16:33.490 --> 16:36.170
Out, you lousy bastard!

16:36.170 --> 16:39.970
I'm just being myself.
That's what Isa told me to be!

16:39.970 --> 16:43.930
You've got a black heart!
Away and be yourself somewhere else!

16:43.930 --> 16:45.010
Get out!

16:49.410 --> 16:53.330
Isa, look at that. Proper graft.

16:53.330 --> 16:56.690
Planned to perfection
and expertly executed.

16:56.690 --> 16:58.980
Run along, Isa.

16:58.980 --> 17:03.660
Run along now, and tell everybody
what you have seen here today.

17:07.140 --> 17:09.579
Tam!
Yes, Winston?

17:09.579 --> 17:12.819
I don't wish you the health to wear
them, you rat's arse!

17:12.819 --> 17:14.819
Ow!
You and I are finished!

17:27.390 --> 17:29.870
Tea - the workers' reward. There you
are.

17:29.870 --> 17:31.550
There you go. Oh, lovely, lovely.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.750
Thank you. I'll tell you something
else, boys.

17:33.750 --> 17:37.070
See that ramp? That ramp's gonnae
be there long after we're gone.

17:37.070 --> 17:40.350
People are gonnae walk by here
in years to come and they're gonnae
say,

17:40.350 --> 17:42.470
"Who forged this?"

17:42.470 --> 17:45.790
And the answer will be,
"They say that three men came

17:45.790 --> 17:48.960
"and gave of their time
selflessly and tirelessly

17:48.960 --> 17:50.840
"for the benefit of a dear friend."

17:50.840 --> 17:53.520
Yes, and that there, boys,
will be our legacy,

17:53.520 --> 17:55.680
which nobody can befoul.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.360
Oh, you little bastard!
You wee cheeky...!

18:07.720 --> 18:09.960
WHIMPERS

18:09.960 --> 18:12.520
LOCK RATTLES

18:12.520 --> 18:14.010
Oh, by Christ!

18:16.370 --> 18:20.090
Whoever you are, you can bugger off!

18:20.090 --> 18:24.330
I'm team-handed in here,
and one of them's my mate Peggy.

18:24.330 --> 18:28.050
You might have seen her about.
She's built like a brick shit-house!

18:36.340 --> 18:37.740
SHRIEKS

18:39.260 --> 18:43.060
Open the door, Mrs Drennan.
Oh!

18:43.060 --> 18:47.740
Oh, you big, lanky streak of creepy
piss. What you doing to me?

18:50.220 --> 18:55.300
That's the last straw, Mr Sheathing.
Here, I quit.

18:55.300 --> 19:00.460
If I stay here any longer, the next
person you'll be burying is me!

19:00.460 --> 19:01.780
Not quite.

19:02.950 --> 19:04.670
I think you'd better sit down.

19:10.870 --> 19:13.750
Must be a lot to lose your legs.

19:17.430 --> 19:19.030
Oh, no!

19:19.030 --> 19:21.270
I've got to be honest with you,
boys.

19:21.270 --> 19:24.070
I thought you were going to
make a total arse of it.

19:24.070 --> 19:27.030
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh!

19:27.030 --> 19:29.960
I didnae think you had it in yous.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.600
Oh! Oh!

19:32.600 --> 19:34.240
Waaah!

19:34.240 --> 19:36.880
Oh, no! Oh!

19:36.880 --> 19:39.400
I thought the whole thing
was gonnae fall flat on its face.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.800
Oh, no!

19:42.560 --> 19:46.960
Well, Boabby, when you're quite
finished blowing smoke up our arses,

19:46.960 --> 19:50.480
is there any chance we can get
three more pints to throw down our
necks?

19:50.480 --> 19:52.090
Fine.

19:59.810 --> 20:02.250
Tam's died.

20:07.730 --> 20:10.410
Well, I've been up to see Frances,

20:10.410 --> 20:13.730
and frankly,
I couldnae get much out of her.

20:13.730 --> 20:15.250
That's a first.

20:15.250 --> 20:18.020
What were you expecting?
The Gettysburg Address?

20:18.020 --> 20:21.020
What I meant was,
she was in an awful strange mood.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.980
Course she was in a strange mood,
Isa. Her man's just died.

20:24.980 --> 20:28.420
She'll be in shock, Isa.
Nothing strange about that.

20:28.420 --> 20:32.260
Well, I think one of yous should go
up.

20:32.260 --> 20:36.140
Well, I cannae go up. I barred him.
What am I gonnae say?

20:36.140 --> 20:38.460
"Oh, I'm so sorry about Tam,
Frances,

20:38.460 --> 20:41.460
"but look on the bright side -
he's no longer barred from my shop."

20:41.470 --> 20:44.190
BOABBY: Well, I'm in the same boat.

20:44.190 --> 20:46.350
"Sorry about your loss, Frances.

20:46.350 --> 20:48.030
"You're in my thoughts, hen,

20:48.030 --> 20:50.670
"as is the tab he run up over 30
year."

20:50.670 --> 20:53.750
Look, I know it should be me that
goes up,

20:53.750 --> 20:58.790
being as his best pal and all,
but what am I gonnae say?

20:58.790 --> 21:01.430
"Frances, I feel terrible about
this,

21:01.430 --> 21:03.910
"but I'm just happy
it was a heart attack he died of

21:03.910 --> 21:05.830
"and no' a brain haemorrhage,

21:05.830 --> 21:08.160
"after I bounced
those Clarks brogues off his heid"?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.640
BOTH: Jesus.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.000
Hello, boys.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Hello, Frances.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.200
We thought we'd just come round and
just check to see everything was all
right.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.010
Just wanted to see if there was
anything we could do for ye.

21:31.010 --> 21:33.810
No. Mr Sheathing's
taking care of everything.

21:33.810 --> 21:37.370
He's even going to speak,
cos I'm too upset.

21:37.370 --> 21:38.690
Right.

21:38.690 --> 21:40.610
Is that a problem?

21:40.610 --> 21:45.010
Well, it's just that Mr Sheathing
didnae really know Tam, did he?

21:45.010 --> 21:46.290
Not like all of us.

21:47.490 --> 21:49.930
OK, then.
You two can speak at his funeral.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.410
How did we get saddled with this?

21:55.420 --> 21:57.060
Oh, well, let me remind you.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.300
You said,
"Sheathing didnae really know him."

21:59.300 --> 22:02.860
Well, let me remind you.
You said, "Not like all of us."

22:02.860 --> 22:05.260
Wanker.
Call me a wanker, you wanker!

22:05.260 --> 22:08.820
Aye, well, we're a couple of
wankers, aren't we? Tam...

22:10.100 --> 22:12.140
That's us dropping like flies now.

22:12.140 --> 22:16.660
Christ, Jack, I'm really gonnae miss
him.

22:16.660 --> 22:18.420
Aye, me too.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.550
Well, we're just gonnae have
to come up with a few fitting words

22:22.550 --> 22:24.310
to send him on his way.

22:31.470 --> 22:32.910
"Dearly beloved..."

22:32.910 --> 22:36.590
Oh, you cannae start with that,
Jack. We're no' priests or
ministers.

22:36.590 --> 22:40.430
We're his pals! I mean,
what do we know about Tam?

22:40.430 --> 22:43.960
What do we know? What do we know?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.830
He was a miserable bastard.

22:45.830 --> 22:50.000
"Miserable...bastard."

22:50.000 --> 22:52.560
He used to love to con Boabby out a
pint.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.680
Aye, he did indeed. Aye.
That was always funny.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.440
Is that no' the same
as "miserable bastard"?

22:58.440 --> 23:00.280
Aye.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.040
Got it.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.120
"Although he loved Frances,
he never took her any holidays,

23:05.120 --> 23:08.240
"nor did he buy her any gifts
for her Christmas or her birthday."

23:08.240 --> 23:12.690
Again, I refer to our earlier
statement that he was a miserable
bastard.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.650
Jesus, this is much more difficult
than I thought it was gonnae be.

23:15.650 --> 23:18.690
I think we're making this tougher
than it needs to be, you know.

23:18.690 --> 23:25.330
All we need to do is speak from the
heart in a sort of freeform sense,
you know.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.890
What, like jazz?
Exactly like jazz.

23:27.890 --> 23:28.930
Like...

23:28.930 --> 23:31.170
# Bee-bop ba-doo-ba-doo-doo-doo, Tam

23:31.170 --> 23:33.650
# Boo-bop, ba-doo-ba-da-doo
Miserable bastard

23:33.650 --> 23:35.980
♪ Miserable bastard. ♪

23:46.540 --> 23:47.820
Well...

23:47.820 --> 23:50.380
STUTTERS:
...it's a smashin' day for it.

23:50.380 --> 23:52.300
Victor?

23:52.300 --> 23:55.140
Just you go on the now, Jack.

23:55.140 --> 23:57.380
Er, well, what can we...?

23:57.380 --> 23:58.980
What can we say about Tam?

23:58.990 --> 24:01.870
He was a man that we knew
for a lot of years.

24:01.870 --> 24:04.750
Er, he was just always there.

24:06.550 --> 24:13.350
People would say, "Tam, Tam, Tam,
Tam, he was some man."

24:13.350 --> 24:16.270
He was... He was tight...

24:16.270 --> 24:21.190
...er, with the rest of us.
We were a tight group.

24:21.190 --> 24:24.870
Miserable...that we all are
now that he's gone.

24:24.870 --> 24:28.480
Jack, Victor, a valiant effort,

24:28.480 --> 24:30.080
but on the whole, piss-poor.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.920
Allow me.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.440
Tam...was a miserable git.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.520
He was never happier than when
he was trying to con you out of
something.

24:42.040 --> 24:46.120
A fiver. A pint. A loaf.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.530
A fridge-freezer. A space hopper.
Och, anything.

24:49.530 --> 24:52.530
And he was always coming up
wi' some sob story

24:52.530 --> 24:56.490
to make you part wi' your money.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.770
But that got on most people's tits,
including mine.

24:58.770 --> 25:03.210
And so, the last time I saw him,
we fell out.

25:03.210 --> 25:07.690
But if I'm being honest with myself,
it made me laugh -

25:07.690 --> 25:10.210
the barefaced cheek of the man.

25:10.210 --> 25:11.970
CHUCKLING

25:11.970 --> 25:14.090
And I think Tam knew that.

25:15.620 --> 25:20.380
And I think that's why he did it -
to gie us all a laugh.

25:20.380 --> 25:23.540
I mean, if we're no' here for
a bastardin' laugh, what are we here
for?

25:23.540 --> 25:24.820
LAUGHTER

25:24.820 --> 25:26.620
Well said, Winston.

25:29.620 --> 25:33.020
Right, who wants a drink?

25:33.020 --> 25:35.940
On me. For Tam.

25:35.940 --> 25:38.060
His final freebie.

25:39.270 --> 25:41.220
A pint o' snakebite, Boabby.

25:41.220 --> 25:42.420
Two orange juice.

25:43.510 --> 25:45.670
This is grim, isn't it?
Mm.

25:48.190 --> 25:49.590
Come on.

25:54.430 --> 25:55.670
You all right?

25:55.670 --> 25:59.110
I'm about to get my leg hacked off
in five weeks.

26:00.510 --> 26:04.360
They should have just threw me down
that hole along wi' Tam this
afternoon.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.480
CLEARS HIS THROAT: We're gonnae
have a wee word wi' Frances.

26:12.160 --> 26:16.480
Boys, boys,
