WEBVTT

00:19.120 --> 00:22.520
I did what I could.
I don't think I did so badly.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.720
DIEGO ARMANDO MARADONA

00:25.800 --> 00:29.760
The best soccer player of all time

03:04.160 --> 03:08.520
THE HAND OF GOD

04:00.520 --> 04:02.280
Hi, Patrizia.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.920
That’s me. Who are you?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.240
What do you mean, who am I?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.520
I’m San Gennaro.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.040
-How do you know my name?
-I told you, I’m San Gennaro.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.520
You’re waiting for the 412 bus, right?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.800
It’ll never come,
you could be waiting for hours.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.120
You want a ride?

04:34.720 --> 04:38.680
We can take you home if you like,
Luigino Serra and I.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.360
A pleasure, Luigino Serra.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.080
No, thanks. I’ll take the bus.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.600
You can't have children, can you?

04:52.480 --> 04:53.600
Get in.

04:53.680 --> 04:58.120
On the way, I’ll explain how you can have
a child with your husband…

04:58.840 --> 04:59.880
…Franco.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.440
Let’s go, Luigino.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.880
Where are we going?

05:46.960 --> 05:51.040
We’re stopping by my house,
so I can explain it better to you.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.240
Jesus!

06:23.760 --> 06:24.760
The Little Monk!

06:26.720 --> 06:29.600
Yes, that’s him all right,
the Little Monk.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
Come here, Little Monk.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.840
Now, Patrizia, bend over

07:06.520 --> 07:08.720
and kiss the Little Monk’s head.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.680
For good luck.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.400
There!

07:19.040 --> 07:22.040
Now you can have
all the children you want…

07:23.400 --> 07:24.640
<i>My pretty Patrizia.</i>

07:24.720 --> 07:26.600
It’s 10 p.m. Where’ve you been?

07:27.680 --> 07:28.880
Wait…

07:30.240 --> 07:34.280
You won’t believe it,
but the bus was two hours late.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.040
You did it again.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.840
You did it again? Whore!

07:45.840 --> 07:47.000
Come over here!

07:51.120 --> 07:53.280
I’ll bash your head in!

07:53.360 --> 07:54.920
-Letch!
-Whore!

07:59.000 --> 08:00.480
Come here!

08:01.000 --> 08:03.840
You locked the door?
C’mon, I’m not gonna hurt you.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.160
I’m not gonna hurt you!

08:08.360 --> 08:09.800
Open up!

08:13.360 --> 08:16.040
Hurry, Marì, Franco wants to kill me.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.560
-Slow down, sweetie.
-Don’t worry, Mama.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.040
I’m falling off!

08:41.840 --> 08:42.920
What happened?

08:43.920 --> 08:46.320
The whore did it again.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.880
She was turning tricks again!

08:51.960 --> 08:54.720
That’s not true! I met San Gennaro.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.400
He took me to the Little Monk,
he’s the one who gave me the money.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.560
He told me that
I can get pregnant now.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.720
That’s why I was late.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.200
Piece of shit! I did it for you!

09:23.280 --> 09:26.040
Saverio, did you see
my sister has a bloody nose?

09:27.240 --> 09:29.440
Go get a wet cloth.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.720
You can knock it off as well.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.480
Marì, I swear to God,
it was the Little Monk.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.640
Patrizia, please, stop.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.800
Whore!

09:50.440 --> 09:51.920
Whore!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.040
I’ll go talk to him.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.040
Whore, whore and whore!

09:59.760 --> 10:02.280
Franco, you gotta stop.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.360
She’s a whore.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.280
She’s not a whore, she’s sick,
even the psychiatrist said so.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.160
Being childless sent her over the edge.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.760
-She’s depressed.
-She’s a whore.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.920
But Uncle…

10:19.280 --> 10:21.640
…what if she really saw the Little Monk?

10:24.160 --> 10:27.560
Keep saying crap like that
and you’ll flunk out of school.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.880
The baroness is such a drag.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.360
Mama, have you ever seen
the baroness’s house?

10:48.440 --> 10:51.360
Sure, when her husband was alive,
I went often.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.080
But after he died,
she doesn’t let anyone in.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.480
-What’s the house like?
-Weird.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.360
And her husband?

10:59.440 --> 11:03.240
Signor Attilio, a good man,
a famous gynecologist.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.600
She treated him like a doormat.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.120
She’d only let him go out
for 20 minutes on Saturdays.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.640
She’d fill out the gambling slip
and he’d go place the bet.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.760
Fabiè, wake up your brother,
he’s got university.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.280
Marchino, get up,
you’ve gotta go to class.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.720
-Daniela, out.
-No.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.880
Come out, I gotta go to work
and Fabietto’s gotta go to school.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.120
-Is your brother up?
-No, he was out till four.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.200
-What are you doing?
-Cutting my nails.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.240
-Can’t you cut them in your room?
-No.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.440
-Where do you get that cockiness from?
-From you!

11:43.520 --> 11:45.920
Papa, you think Maradona will come?

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
No way, he’d never
leave Barcelona for this shithole.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.160
He won’t come!

11:51.240 --> 11:55.040
See? Your sister even learns stuff
locked in that bathroom.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.280
A little bird tells me
you’re building a chalet in Roccaraso.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.080
A chalet! More like a two-room condo.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.880
With a yard! You’re making good money.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.520
My late husband
wanted a house in the mountains.

12:11.600 --> 12:16.040
I told him he’d end up in a dumpster
if he did something so foolish.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.280
Humanity is dreadful,
didn’t they tell you?

12:22.360 --> 12:24.560
No, nobody told me anything.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.640
Have you met
your sister-in-law’s boyfriend?

12:26.720 --> 12:31.120
-We will on Sunday, in Agerola.
-Agerola’s such a shithole.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.000
-The air is clean.
-All shitholes have clean air.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.680
Is that Baroness Focale?

12:36.360 --> 12:39.920
-She looks just like John Paul II.
-You’re right.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.960
But the Pope is sexier.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.040
Let me see. You look good, I like it.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.200
Goodbye, sweetie.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.600
Your neighbor went
to that wedding on Saturday.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.760
How was it?

13:03.840 --> 13:06.720
The way she tells it,
it was like Charles and Diana’s.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.800
"Incredible, enchanting,
elegant, captivating."

13:10.880 --> 13:15.840
-Nice!
-Nice? Vulgar is more like it.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.080
A wedding on Procida Island?
Just imagine.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.600
I could understand Capri, but Procida…

13:20.680 --> 13:25.280
I don’t believe her, but she says
that Franco Zeffirelli was there.

13:25.360 --> 13:29.480
He kissed her hand and said,
"What a beautiful lady!"

13:29.560 --> 13:31.720
Why don’t you believe her, Baroness?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.880
Zeffirelli bats for the other team.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.720
Imagine him kissing
that ghastly Graziella!

13:39.240 --> 13:43.480
-You really dislike her.
-She and her whole family put on airs.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.240
Just because they’re
from the north of Italy.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.760
Those dimwits think
they’re Austro-Hungarian!

13:49.840 --> 13:52.120
We’re from the Kingdom of Naples!

13:52.200 --> 13:54.320
Don’t make fun of me.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.280
Oh Madonna! Just a second.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.440
What’s she doing?

14:12.480 --> 14:13.680
Let’s go.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.600
Lovey-dovey nonsense!

14:16.680 --> 14:19.840
My husband liked that too,
but I told him in rhyme,

14:19.920 --> 14:24.120
"Attiliuccio, let me be clear,
I’m a drill sergeant, dear."

14:24.200 --> 14:27.680
-I’m going, I’m bored.
-I’ll bring your lunch?

14:27.760 --> 14:31.080
Leave it at my door
and tap the broom five times.

14:32.040 --> 14:32.880
Bye.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.360
See ya.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.800
Do you need to make a confession?

15:21.960 --> 15:23.880
Antò, can you see them?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.400
Not yet, Uncle.

15:25.880 --> 15:26.960
Fly, Dieghito…

15:27.040 --> 15:29.360
-Piece of shit.
-Stop!

15:29.440 --> 15:30.920
Piece of shit!

15:32.400 --> 15:34.720
Would you pass me the peaches in wine?

15:36.840 --> 15:40.800
Look at your mama,
she's goading Signora Gentile.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.800
She likes making her say bad words.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.880
Everybody knows Signora Gentile
is the meanest woman in Naples.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.480
And who’s got her as an in-law? Me.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.120
-Is she cold?
-No, she’s just showing off her fur coat.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.200
-You’re dripping all over yourself.
-Fuck off!

15:59.840 --> 16:01.640
Why don’t you come join us?

16:01.720 --> 16:03.880
Because you people are trash!

16:04.560 --> 16:06.840
What pleasantries
is Signora Gentile saying?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.520
In a most poetic outburst,

16:10.600 --> 16:14.600
she says she holds us all
in the highest regard.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.360
Why didn’t Daniela come?

16:18.440 --> 16:21.200
She was in the bathroom.
We waited for her for two hours.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.960
-Auntie, can you juggle the oranges?
-Of course, sweetheart!

16:25.560 --> 16:29.000
Auntie Maria!

16:32.440 --> 16:34.000
Go, Maria!

16:37.400 --> 16:38.680
She never stops.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.040
How the heck does she do it?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.680
Uncle Alfredo’s wife is here.

16:54.440 --> 16:58.760
-Austera!
-The scientist has arrived!

16:59.360 --> 17:01.680
Will you stop being an asshole?

17:01.760 --> 17:04.120
Austera, don’t pay any attention to him.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.360
-Everything okay?
-My spleen’s acting up.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.640
-Did you go for a jog?
-I’ve never jogged in my life.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.080
What are you working on
in your mysterious lab?

17:15.160 --> 17:18.840
You won’t believe it,
but my team and I

17:18.920 --> 17:22.520
are close to finding the cure for cancer.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.000
Nenè, you didn't even try
the bell peppers.

17:25.080 --> 17:29.120
Of course not, I’m doing "Witch Watch."

17:29.200 --> 17:30.680
What’s that?

17:30.760 --> 17:32.800
She means Weight Watchers.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.600
She’s already lost almost 8 pounds.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.200
Lose another 130
to match Pavarotti's weight!

17:37.280 --> 17:38.600
Shut the hell up.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.080
Don’t listen to her.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.680
Riccardino, can you see them?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.040
Not yet, Uncle.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.880
-Antò, see anything?
-Not a thing.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.840
Have any of you seen
our sister’s boyfriend?

17:50.920 --> 17:53.080
Luisella says he’s handsome.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.120
I highly doubt that.

17:55.200 --> 17:59.200
Our sister’s always been butt-ugly
and a real idiot.

17:59.280 --> 18:03.360
Please, even if you don’t like him,
don’t start with your crap.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.000
Luisella is 42.
Who knows how she found this moron.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.080
<i>"Lucean carriere zitellesche innanzi,"</i>
said the great poet.

18:11.160 --> 18:14.520
It's his classical education,
can't you tell?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.880
-You look great, <i>Mammì</i>.
-Fuck off!

18:16.960 --> 18:19.720
Here I am. Did you miss me?

18:19.800 --> 18:21.000
Terribly!

18:21.080 --> 18:24.240
Austera, have you found
a cure for Geppino?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.200
There’s no hope for him.

18:27.960 --> 18:33.160
How’s the watermelon?
My veterinarian friend gave it to me.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.240
-Be honest, though.
-It’s good.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.680
-How big a schmuck is Geppino?
-Huge. You know what he does?

18:40.760 --> 18:43.400
He looks the other way
when the vet clinics get inspected.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.080
In exchange,
he gets watermelons and champagne.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.920
-And even a fur for his mother.
-Absolutely!

18:49.000 --> 18:51.360
Sooner or later, he’ll end up in jail.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.480
-Riccardino, you see them?
-Nothin’.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.160
-Antò?
-Not yet.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.840
Silvana, what do you know
about Luisella’s new boyfriend?

18:59.920 --> 19:02.120
Only his name, Aldo.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
What does he do for a living?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.520
You’re not telling the truth, you know!

19:06.600 --> 19:08.520
-Marchino, she knows.
-I dunno.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.800
-How’s your acting career going?
-Don’t go on about that.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.840
He’s got an audition with Fellini.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.320
It’s not an audition,
Fellini’s just looking for extras.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.400
-He’s seeing 4,000 people.
-It’s still an audition.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.200
-Antò?
-Still <i>The Desert of the Tartars</i>.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.600
Antonio’s studying classics too?

20:08.520 --> 20:13.200
-<i>Mammì</i>, want some chilled watermelon?
-Piss off, stop fucking with me.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.280
Stop laughing, you idiot.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.640
I think Pelé and Di Stefano
are better than Maradona.

20:30.840 --> 20:35.120
When did you all become
such disappointments?

20:36.520 --> 20:38.800
Why are you so sure of yourselves?

20:39.360 --> 20:43.000
Stick with eating and drinking,
that’s all you know how to do.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.560
My friend who owns a bar in Turin

20:45.640 --> 20:48.160
said Agnelli has reached a deal
with Maradona.

20:48.240 --> 20:51.360
-Don’t say that in front of Alfredo.
-I don’t believe it.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.800
Agnelli has coffee there every morning
and he confided in him.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.880
Yeah, Agnelli drinks coffee
at your friend’s bar!

20:57.960 --> 20:59.560
What crap!

20:59.640 --> 21:02.960
Do you really think Maradona
will come play for Napoli?

21:03.040 --> 21:05.520
It’s all shit they make up
to sell newspapers.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.040
Ferlaino is a stingy chairman.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.280
I know him well,
he comes to the bank a lot.

21:10.360 --> 21:14.720
Fabiè, if Maradona
doesn’t come play for Napoli,

21:14.800 --> 21:16.200
I’ll kill myself.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
You understand?

21:19.760 --> 21:21.840
I’ll kill myself.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.280
Look!

21:23.960 --> 21:25.560
-They're here!
-He’s crippled!

21:26.120 --> 21:27.280
What do you mean?

21:27.360 --> 21:30.880
-He must’ve hurt himself.
-Gimme the binoculars.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.000
What is he, a war vet?

21:39.280 --> 21:40.560
He’s got a bum leg.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.960
He’s really ugly.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.840
He’s ugly as shit!

22:17.840 --> 22:19.160
Pleased to meet you.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.960
I’m Aldo Cavallo,
retired Venetian police officer,

22:23.040 --> 22:24.680
amateur pastry chef,

22:24.760 --> 22:28.840
and official fiancé
of your sister-in-law, Luisella Schisa.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.800
My intentions are very serious.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.440
You too?

22:34.960 --> 22:37.320
Why are you all such disappointments?

22:37.400 --> 22:40.600
-I wouldn’t know.
-Ignore him.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.480
Our uncle’s a lawyer.

22:42.560 --> 22:46.000
He’s grown a little cynical
after losing 18 consecutive lawsuits.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.080
It’s a pleasure, I’m Aldo Cavallo,

22:49.160 --> 22:51.720
retired Venetian police officer,
amateur pastry chef,

22:51.800 --> 22:55.320
and official fiancé
of your sister, Luisella Schisa.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.720
-My intentions are very serious.
-What intentions?

22:58.800 --> 23:03.160
I want to marry her
and make her happy for all eternity.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.120
Let’s aim for Christmas!
You’re 80 years old.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.960
-Saverio!
-He’s always joking.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.200
I’m 70, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.880
I exercise every morning.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.560
-I’m still a vigorous young man.
-A handsome young man!

23:18.640 --> 23:21.240
We have to introduce Aldo
to Signora Gentile.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.600
No, please!

23:22.680 --> 23:25.360
Instead, to celebrate their engagement,

23:25.440 --> 23:27.960
how about we go swimming
off my new boat?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.960
-Coming, Uncle Alfredo?
-Geppino, the sea…

23:32.200 --> 23:34.360
-It's a disappointment.
-He can’t swim.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.920
-Signora Gentile, will you come with us?
-Go suck a sausage!

23:39.800 --> 23:41.680
What did she say about sausages?

23:41.760 --> 23:45.280
Mama says to offer you a snack.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.480
Let’s go then.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.400
So…

24:02.080 --> 24:06.920
In honor of our much-loved Eduardo,
who resided here,

24:07.640 --> 24:13.280
I’ll recite for you, my beloved Maria,
<i>Si t'o sapesse dicere</i>.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.320
Then place a very fine mesh sieve

24:16.400 --> 24:19.400
over the mixing bowl,

24:19.480 --> 24:22.440
add the flour and cornstarch.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.400
Then sift!

24:25.040 --> 24:27.880
That’s the secret
the world has forgotten.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.680
"I want to be with you eternally."

24:32.600 --> 24:35.160
You have to sift well, my dear.

24:35.720 --> 24:39.680
Sorry, I’m a bit hot,
do you mind if I take a dip?

24:39.760 --> 24:41.600
Of course not, my love.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.920
Down she goes!

24:54.000 --> 24:55.960
The whale has submerged.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.320
Your classical education is ruining you.

25:04.040 --> 25:07.960
So, Signora Patrizia,
I was telling Luisella

25:08.040 --> 25:11.200
how to make a sponge cake.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.960
It’s not an easy recipe, of course.

25:14.040 --> 25:18.520
As I was saying,
sifting is so misunderstood.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.560
Will you show me
your little voice gadget?

25:22.120 --> 25:23.360
Certainly.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.360
She’s crazy.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.000
Crazy and a whore.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.360
Oh my God!

26:38.600 --> 26:41.200
They're chasing the cigarette smugglers

26:41.280 --> 26:44.240
and won’t stop till
they’ve dumped all the goods.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.280
The officers can’t touch them then.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.400
He really knows how to drive that boat!

27:10.560 --> 27:13.760
Fabietto, can you bring me a towel?

27:47.320 --> 27:49.800
You’ve gotten so big, Fabiè.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.320
What’s he saying?

29:50.640 --> 29:52.720
That they have to go buy batteries.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.920
Don’t look at me.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.640
There’s nothing to see.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.640
<i>I talked with Nennella.</i>

31:58.720 --> 32:00.960
There’s some hot gossip.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.160
-Now what?
-Sizzling hot!

32:04.240 --> 32:05.440
Like what?

32:05.520 --> 32:09.760
Aldo gave Luisella
some hot pink stockings.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.680
Don’t make me throw up!

32:12.320 --> 32:13.800
Come look at the house.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.480
-Where’s Daniela?
-Where do you think? In the bathroom.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.680
The fireplace will go here.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.040
Fireplace?

32:23.160 --> 32:26.360
I’ve always wanted
a house with a fireplace.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Do you think Diego will come?

32:33.080 --> 32:35.320
-No, I don’t.
-I do.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.720
So…

32:41.600 --> 32:43.680
How hot was Aunt Patrizia today?

32:44.840 --> 32:46.040
Buck naked.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.680
On a scale of one to a hundred?

32:49.440 --> 32:50.880
A billion.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.560
If you had to choose…

32:57.440 --> 33:01.680
between Maradona coming to Napoli
and screwing Aunt Patrizia…

33:05.320 --> 33:06.720
…which would you choose?

33:08.480 --> 33:09.960
Maradona.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.280
You're pretty good.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.640
What do you want? Get lost!

35:36.880 --> 35:38.880
So, how did it go?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.040
Awful.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.320
He said I have a conventional face,
I asked what that meant,

35:45.400 --> 35:48.520
and he said,
"You look like a waiter from Anacapri."

35:48.600 --> 35:50.800
So, Marchino, what did he say?

35:52.600 --> 35:55.440
He said I have a conventional face…

35:56.200 --> 35:57.560
Stefania.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.040
My dear Antonella.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.600
Agnese, Luisa, Giusy.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.360
Elisabetta…
Elisabetta’s never around.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.280
Not her, the one to the left.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.800
Camille, Celine,

36:14.800 --> 36:17.440
Eleonore, Florence.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.960
Petra… Not her, the voluptuous one!

36:23.040 --> 36:26.000
Geltrude, Inga…

36:27.120 --> 36:29.840
Fanny… what a beauty. Fanny!

36:31.040 --> 36:32.480
Olimpia.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.560
Rosa.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.240
Oh my God!

36:38.320 --> 36:40.760
Sofia, Margot.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.480
Odille.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.120
Dolores.

36:47.320 --> 36:48.520
Esmeralda.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.080
-What else did Fellini say?
-Nothing.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.640
At one point, a journalist called.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.320
Fellini says to him,
"Cinema’s not good for anything."

37:00.400 --> 37:02.040
"But it's a distraction."

37:02.760 --> 37:05.720
The journalist must’ve asked him,

37:06.240 --> 37:08.440
"A distraction from what?"

37:08.520 --> 37:11.760
And Fellini says, "From reality."

37:12.400 --> 37:14.760
"Reality is lousy."

37:15.760 --> 37:17.200
That’s all he said?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.960
Isn’t that enough?

37:20.560 --> 37:21.720
It’s him!

37:50.760 --> 37:53.440
Papa, listen to me, I swear.

37:53.520 --> 37:58.040
Do you like it?
It’s a lithograph by Guttuso, one of us.

37:58.120 --> 38:01.160
I swear it was Maradona, ask Marchino.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.800
Bullshit! Read this.
"No Napoli for Maradona."

38:05.560 --> 38:08.160
-How did the audition go?
-Don't ask.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.240
The audition! I forgot about that.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.800
-Tell him it was Maradona.
-It did look like him.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.520
-What did you rent?
-<i>Once Upon a Time in America.</i>

38:16.600 --> 38:19.280
The one with De Niro?
We’ll watch it later.

38:26.480 --> 38:29.120
Signora Pichler? Oh, good evening.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.160
This is Maestro Zeffirelli’s assistant.

38:34.120 --> 38:38.480
The maestro tells me
that you crossed paths at a wedding.

38:39.200 --> 38:43.280
He was very taken
with your radiant and lively face.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.160
That’s how he described it.

38:45.240 --> 38:49.800
The maestro is working
on a new film, about Callas.

38:50.440 --> 38:53.920
He is looking for a leading lady
and he would like to see you.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.920
Could you possibly come to Rome?

39:02.520 --> 39:06.640
Why don’t we buy a TV
with a remote like everyone else?

39:06.720 --> 39:09.000
Don’t talk nonsense, I’m a communist.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.040
-Did you go to the bathroom?
-Daniela’s in there.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.240
Friends!

39:18.080 --> 39:19.560
Fabulous news!

39:20.600 --> 39:24.000
Zeffirelli’s assistant called Graziella.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.080
He wants her to star in his next film.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.040
Hooray, Graziella!

39:37.120 --> 39:38.960
Well done!

39:39.040 --> 39:40.680
Congratulations!

39:41.360 --> 39:44.480
-What’s going on?
-Fabulous news!

39:44.560 --> 39:47.880
Graziella is going to star
in Zeffirelli’s next film.

39:47.960 --> 39:51.600
-She's going to play Callas!
-How did you know it’s Callas?

39:51.680 --> 39:53.640
I read it in <i>Gente</i>.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.320
Graziella, get ready for an Oscar!

39:56.400 --> 40:00.360
Don’t forget about us
when you get to Hollywood.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.040
I’ll never forget about you.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.760
You delivered that line so well.

40:07.680 --> 40:11.200
Let’s get home now!
What if Zeffirelli calls back?

40:11.280 --> 40:13.520
I heard the phone ringing! Hurry!

40:13.600 --> 40:15.480
We’ll celebrate on Saturday!

40:15.560 --> 40:17.520
Saturday it is!

40:18.440 --> 40:21.760
I won’t go to the premiere,
it’ll be tacky.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.480
I’m going, I’m bored.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.320
Goodbye, Baroness!

40:28.920 --> 40:30.680
What an incredible story.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.400
Incredible, is it?

40:38.280 --> 40:40.360
Will you ever stop playing pranks?

40:42.480 --> 40:44.280
You’re gonna kill her.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.880
She’ll never know it was me.

40:46.960 --> 40:51.720
Yes, she will.
Because you’re gonna tell her.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.600
We’re communists.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.800
We’re honest to the core.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.280
I’m not going by myself.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.480
You Neapolitans!

41:14.320 --> 41:16.080
You Neapolitans!

41:16.880 --> 41:20.120
It’s not true what people say,
that you’re all nice.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.400
You’re mean.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.000
That’s what you are!

41:26.800 --> 41:29.360
I never want to see you again.

41:31.480 --> 41:35.240
Don’t you dare eat any of those <i>canederli</i>.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.400
Don’t move.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.640
Hello?

41:47.720 --> 41:49.640
<i>Did your husband talk to you?</i>

41:49.720 --> 41:51.320
What do you want, bitch?

41:51.400 --> 41:55.720
<i>He hasn’t talked to you yet?</i>
<i>Then tell him he should.</i>

41:58.600 --> 42:01.280
You leave that whore now!

42:01.360 --> 42:03.960
You promised me
you wouldn’t see her anymore!

42:04.400 --> 42:05.640
Who’s she talking about?

42:06.680 --> 42:11.560
Signora Villa, Papa’s colleague.
They’ve been together for years.

42:11.640 --> 42:15.640
I can’t, you know
the situation’s complicated!

42:15.720 --> 42:18.000
Daniela! Get out of there!

42:18.080 --> 42:20.000
No, you get out!

43:15.800 --> 43:17.680
Let’s go back to bed.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.480
Fabietto!

44:02.080 --> 44:04.520
Don’t think about it.

44:05.840 --> 44:08.200
Think about Aunt Patrizia.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.680
Think about Maradona.

44:17.320 --> 44:19.000
What the fuck…

44:19.680 --> 44:21.680
I can’t stop.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.280
Hello?

44:42.600 --> 44:44.480
Pass me that whore.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.760
Okay, bye.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.120
It was Filippo Anzalone.

45:04.040 --> 45:05.800
My colleague from the bank.

45:06.360 --> 45:10.120
He was working late,
dealing with the paperwork.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.320
He wanted to tell me right away.

45:14.640 --> 45:15.640
Tell you what?

45:17.440 --> 45:19.240
13 billion in bank guarantees.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.040
Napoli bought Maradona.

45:32.160 --> 45:34.600
We’ve gotta tell
Uncle Alfredo right away.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.960
Mother of God!

46:17.400 --> 46:19.240
Happy birthday, Fabiè!

46:19.320 --> 46:22.240
-Have you been here before?
-When I was little.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.600
What are you doing for your birthday?
Going out with friends?

46:26.680 --> 46:28.360
I’m not coming home tonight.

46:28.440 --> 46:32.200
We can’t celebrate together.
Mama’s pissed off.

46:32.280 --> 46:35.080
-The situation’s…
-I don’t have friends.

46:47.960 --> 46:50.920
-How about a girlfriend?
-Yeah, right…

46:51.000 --> 46:55.120
Look, you’ll have a girlfriend soon

46:55.200 --> 46:58.160
and this misery
will be a thing of the past.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.440
But follow my advice.

47:00.520 --> 47:04.680
For your first time, take whatever comes.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.160
Even a total dog is okay.

47:09.320 --> 47:13.520
Just get your first time
out of the fuckin' way.

47:17.440 --> 47:20.400
Here, your birthday present.

47:27.760 --> 47:30.160
Stand B seats, of course.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.760
-Thank you, God!
-Don’t thank God.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.600
I’m the one
who bought you a season ticket!

47:59.280 --> 48:02.040
Signora Maria!
I’ll help you with those.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.840
Thanks, Mario.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.520
-How’s your papa?
-My papa loves me.

48:15.680 --> 48:20.000
Today I got some tests done.
Dad's got high cholesterol.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.120
Mario, what did you just do?

48:53.200 --> 48:55.480
I wanted to make you laugh.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.920
See that column?

49:02.000 --> 49:06.160
I spent the entire war leaning against it.
I was younger than you.

49:10.320 --> 49:13.480
Then one day Luigino,
the son of the doorman,

49:13.560 --> 49:15.280
came over to get me.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.480
-And he took you far away?
-No, he brought me here.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.480
To Piazzetta Serao.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.480
What was here?

49:26.920 --> 49:28.520
A 50-year-old woman.

49:29.560 --> 49:33.200
For a little sugar or anything to eat,

49:34.280 --> 49:36.880
she’d kiss us on the mouth.

49:38.160 --> 49:41.400
And since we were all different ages,

49:42.000 --> 49:45.200
she set out some bricks
for the different heights.

49:47.040 --> 49:48.000
Ingenious.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.800
Women are always ingenious.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.320
So, Luigino did take me far away.

49:59.960 --> 50:02.440
I saw your mother for the first time
there on Via Roma.

50:02.520 --> 50:06.520
She was running to the bomb shelter.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
She was late, she was worried.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.000
She was young.

50:17.240 --> 50:18.720
And she was beautiful.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.520
She still is.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.000
Yes.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.200
She still is.

50:30.640 --> 50:34.120
You sure you only want a bowl
of <i>zuppa di latte</i> for your birthday?

50:35.480 --> 50:37.760
Want me to cook you something special?

50:38.800 --> 50:40.440
<i>Zuppa di latte</i> is special.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.280
It reminds me of when I was little.

50:47.680 --> 50:51.000
Papa would be in Milan for work
and you wouldn’t feel like cooking.

50:52.640 --> 50:56.200
We'd have <i>zuppa di latte</i>
and you’d let me sleep in your bed.

50:59.800 --> 51:02.280
Maybe he wasn’t really in Milan.

51:06.200 --> 51:08.320
What do you want to do after high school?

51:09.240 --> 51:10.240
Philosophy.

51:12.520 --> 51:13.680
What’s that about?

51:17.560 --> 51:19.320
I don’t really know.

51:21.080 --> 51:25.400
I kicked him out because I had to.
I’ll let him come home in a few days.

51:25.480 --> 51:29.280
Where would he go anyway, to her?
She can’t even make<i> zuppa di latte</i>.

51:30.040 --> 51:33.200
Where else does he have it so good?

51:34.760 --> 51:38.400
I’ll let him back in on Thursday so
we can take the furniture to Roccaraso.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.080
The house is finally finished.

51:41.720 --> 51:43.840
I made you tiramisu, want some?

51:44.320 --> 51:47.400
-What about Marchino?
-We’ve lost him.

51:48.080 --> 51:51.560
I saw him with a girl today,
she’s beautiful.

51:56.800 --> 52:01.680
Want to play hide and seek?
You used to hide in my wardrobe.

52:01.760 --> 52:04.520
Mama! I don’t fit in the wardrobe anymore.

52:07.080 --> 52:10.640
You’re right, you’ve gotten too big.

52:32.280 --> 52:34.920
Fabiè, I wanted to buy you a gift.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.800
But I forgot.

52:39.840 --> 52:42.400
That’s okay, Mario,
it’s the thought that counts.

52:43.080 --> 52:44.560
Good.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.520
Bye, Fabietto!

53:36.280 --> 53:38.560
What film is it? Is it Fellini?

53:39.120 --> 53:42.880
No, some director
named Antonio Capuano.

53:43.520 --> 53:45.520
Everyone wants to work with him.

53:45.600 --> 53:47.160
Come on, move it!

53:59.440 --> 54:01.480
-Hey, Julia.
-Hi, Gennaro.

54:02.560 --> 54:06.800
Will you remind Capuano?
I’m at Galleria Toledo Theater.

54:06.880 --> 54:09.320
Don’t worry, he said he’ll come.

54:09.400 --> 54:12.440
The show’s great, it’s going well.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.520
Let me know.

54:23.680 --> 54:24.680
Hello?

54:27.960 --> 54:28.960
Who is it?

55:08.040 --> 55:13.080
I’ve seen you before,
driving a smuggler's boat.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.880
Could be. The sea’s my life.

55:22.960 --> 55:26.080
Diego scored! With a corner kick.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.280
Armà, are we goin’?

55:31.120 --> 55:32.840
-Your girlfriend?
-She’s my sister.

55:33.400 --> 55:36.040
If you like, we can go to a game together.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.920
287170, call me.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.200
-Bye.
-Have a good afternoon.

55:47.520 --> 55:49.040
Easy.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.040
What was that?

55:56.120 --> 55:58.200
There’s something behind that bush.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.560
-Probably a cat.
-Or a wolf.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.480
A wolf?

56:03.960 --> 56:05.520
Nonsense!

56:06.480 --> 56:08.440
It’s just a cat or a dog.

56:09.040 --> 56:12.760
-That’s a bear.
-Yeah, right, a bear in Roccaraso!

56:14.000 --> 56:16.400
-I’m scared, I’m going inside.
-Me too.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.240
Sir, you better come as well.

56:20.280 --> 56:22.440
What a load of crap.

56:48.440 --> 56:51.040
Kitty?

56:53.480 --> 56:55.280
Good God!

56:55.360 --> 56:57.240
Saverio, it’s behind you!

56:59.800 --> 57:01.240
Saverio!

57:01.320 --> 57:07.320
The bear of Roccaraso
is coming to gobble you up!

57:11.080 --> 57:15.360
Are you an idiot?
You gave me a heart attack.

57:15.440 --> 57:18.200
You’ve gotta stop
with these damn pranks!

57:22.160 --> 57:24.680
You were so good!

57:24.760 --> 57:26.040
Terrific!

57:31.400 --> 57:34.640
You, in the bear suit, I loved you!

57:40.840 --> 57:42.400
"Kitty!"

57:42.480 --> 57:43.960
You’re an idiot.

57:48.200 --> 57:49.800
-Did you hurt yourself?
-A lot.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.440
Pass to Diego!

58:00.880 --> 58:01.960
Damn it!

58:09.720 --> 58:11.200
Go!

58:19.080 --> 58:21.280
He’s shorter than the deli guy…

58:23.800 --> 58:26.240
Good evening, are you Geppino Lettieri?

58:26.320 --> 58:28.720
That’s me, what’s going on?

58:30.000 --> 58:31.680
We’re watching the game.

58:32.160 --> 58:33.840
The game’s over.

58:40.240 --> 58:43.680
<i>Maradona again, he tries to dribble…</i>

58:47.600 --> 58:49.120
He scored!

58:49.200 --> 58:50.200
He's the best!

58:57.680 --> 58:59.040
Are you stupid?

59:08.240 --> 59:10.000
Mother of God!

59:10.720 --> 59:11.800
What a player!

59:16.360 --> 59:18.960
<i>Maradona touched the ball with his hand.</i>

59:19.040 --> 59:23.400
<i>I think it's a handball.</i>
<i>Here’s the action replay.</i>

59:23.480 --> 59:26.320
<i>Here’s Valdano, who seems</i>
<i>to have ruined everything…</i>

59:27.800 --> 59:30.000
<i>And he scores with his fist.</i>

59:30.800 --> 59:32.560
With his hand!

59:33.520 --> 59:35.960
A god! He scored with his hand.

59:37.080 --> 59:40.560
He has avenged
the great Argentine people,

59:40.640 --> 59:45.400
oppressed by the ignoble imperialists
in the <i>Malvinas</i>.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.000
He’s a genius!

59:49.040 --> 59:51.160
It’s a political act.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.000
A revolution.

59:58.080 --> 1:00:00.520
He humiliated them, you understand?

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:03.400
He humiliated them.

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:09.800
<i>The goal was scored with his hand.</i>

1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:28.240
Where the fuck is Silvana?

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:31.200
She went to buy <i>tartufi </i>ice cream.

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.040
Yummy!

1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:36.120
What a shitty world this is.

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:40.680
You go buy dessert and
when you get back your husband’s in jail.

1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:07.880
It’s your fault!

1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:12.360
It’s your fault they arrested my son.

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:17.120
You knew he was cheating
and you didn’t stop him.

1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:19.520
‘Cause you only care about one thing.

1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:21.680
Money!

1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:36.400
Ludovica, can you
get off the bike for a sec?

1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:46.080
Signora Gentile,

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:49.720
you’re a real pain in the ass!

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:51.360
Filthy bitch!

1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:08.400
Luisella, sweetheart.

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.320
It’s a criminal offense.

1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:13.760
Stop.

1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:22.000
<i>Maradona has the ball.</i>

1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:25.120
<i>The Argentine team strikes again.</i>

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:27.760
<i>Maradona passes two opponents,</i>

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:30.480
<i>he has the ball… Maradona scores!</i>

1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:34.120
<i>Magnificent goal by Maradona!</i>
<i>This one done completely with his feet.</i>

1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:37.800
<i>There were no hands.</i>
<i>Magnificent goal by Maradona,</i>

1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:40.480
<i>which counts for this one</i>
<i>and the one before!</i>

1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:53.120
You sure you don’t wanna
come to Roccaraso?

1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:56.840
We play Empoli tomorrow. I can’t miss it.

1:02:56.920 --> 1:02:58.400
Diego’s expecting me.

1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:01.400
There’s some gnocchi in the fridge.

1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:04.680
"Then hunger proved
a greater power than grief."

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:07.360
Sometimes I don’t understand you.

1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:38.120
Watch out for the bear.

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:20.960
Fabiè!

1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:24.240
-We gotta go to Roccaraso.
-What happened?

1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:27.360
Mama and Papa are in the hospital.

1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:30.120
Name's Schisa. We’re their sons.

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:32.960
What happened?

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:39.200
Wait just a moment.

1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:20.240
Just a minute, boys. Just a minute.

1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:37.840
I knew it…

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:55.040
There was…

1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:01.200
…a carbon monoxide leak
at your parents’ house.

1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:09.920
Your mother died there
and your father here at the hospital.

1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:22.640
That’s it?

1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:28.280
That’s all?

1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:36.680
Your father, before he died,
said something.

1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:40.840
What?

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:48.360
"Marì, no pranks."

1:09:57.480 --> 1:09:59.320
You have to let me see them.

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:04.400
It’s better if you don’t.

1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:26.320
You have to let me see them.

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.640
You have to let me see them!

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:38.640
You have to let me see them!

1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:47.160
They’re unrecognizable.
You'd be alarmed.

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:09.200
You have to let me see them!

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:15.800
You have to let me see them.

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000
Let me see them!

1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:25.640
Let me see them!

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:42.520
Matteo, I forgot something.
Wait here for me.

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:12.200
Fuck face.

1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:55.400
Why aren’t you crying?
It'll do you good.

1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:00.240
"If you don't weep now,
when will you weep?"

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.920
-Daniela didn’t come?
-Sure she did.

1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.560
-Where is she?
-She went to the bathroom for a minute.

1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:18.960
And Aunt Patrizia?

1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:21.640
She’s not well.

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:24.720
She’s in the hospital,
in the psychiatric ward.

1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:28.360
Go visit her sometime.

1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:32.640
It’ll make her happy.
You always were her favorite.

1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:02.160
"Through me the way
into the suffering city."

1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:05.720
"Through me the way into eternal pain."

1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:10.760
"Through me the way
that runs among the lost."

1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:37.080
Why weren’t you at Roccaraso?

1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:40.560
You like to ski.

1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:44.000
Napoli played at home.

1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:47.240
I had to see Maradona.

1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:50.760
It was him!

1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:54.000
He’s the one who saved you!

1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:55.680
Who?

1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:57.600
It was him!

1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:01.120
It was the hand of God!

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:40.680
Don’t you wanna be an actor anymore?

1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:45.760
Filmmaking is too hard.

1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:50.800
I’d have to go to Rome.

1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:59.360
What do you call what Maradona just did?

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:05.600
A free kick?

1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:09.440
No.

1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:13.480
It’s called perseverance.

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:19.720
And I’ll never have it.

1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:24.920
So you better have it, Fabiè.

1:16:35.080 --> 1:16:36.080
Fabietto?

1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:45.120
Have you cried?

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:50.440
I can’t.

1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:53.720
What are you gonna do now?

1:16:57.920 --> 1:16:59.040
Maybe I'll watch…

1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:02.600
<i>Once Upon a Time in America.</i>

1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:06.440
Wait for me to come out
and we can watch it together.

1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:09.040
Okay.

1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:14.040
When are you coming out of the bathroom?

1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:17.000
I don’t know.

1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:20.880
You know why Papa
never left Signora Villa?

1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:25.720
No, I don’t.

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.120
They had a son eight years ago.

1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:35.760
When were you gonna tell me?

1:17:37.640 --> 1:17:40.040
When you were bigger.

1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:41.640
Which is when?

1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:46.280
Now.

1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:48.920
You’re bigger now.

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.040
Thanks.

1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:44.920
Come on, let’s go.

1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:48.000
It’s time.

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:51.280
How are you?

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:53.400
I can’t cry.

1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:57.320
Don’t worry.

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.280
It means it’s not the right time.

1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:07.000
What do you want to be when you grow up?

1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:12.840
I’m embarrassed to tell you.

1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:16.120
Anyway, it’ll never happen.

1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:18.600
It’s a crazy idea.

1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:25.040
If it’s crazy,
you’re talking to the right person.

1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:34.440
A film director.

1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:38.000
That’s what I want to be.

1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:41.240
What a great idea!

1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:45.840
If you make it, will you come get me?

1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:51.440
That way… I’ll be your muse.

1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:56.200
You already are my muse.

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:24.440
Do you remember
when you came to my house?

1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:27.280
You, your papa and your mama.

1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:32.200
That time Uncle Franco hit me.

1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:36.880
Yes.

1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:41.680
I remember every single time
I’ve ever seen you.

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:46.040
Yeah, I know.

1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:54.320
That night, Uncle Franco and I made up.

1:20:55.800 --> 1:20:57.200
We made love.

1:20:59.880 --> 1:21:02.000
And you know what?

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:04.800
I got pregnant.

1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:12.960
A week later,
Uncle Franco and I fought again.

1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:17.400
I had a miscarriage.

1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:22.160
I got by on pills.

1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:25.720
But then I couldn’t take it anymore.

1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:30.040
So I said, "Bring me here

1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:33.040
or I’ll kill myself."

1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:49.280
Remember when you said
you saw the Little Monk?

1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:56.600
I believed you.

1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:45.280
What is it, Baroness?

1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:46.640
Fabietto,

1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:50.040
a bat flew into the living room.

1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:53.200
Can you get rid of it?

1:22:56.800 --> 1:22:58.040
I can try.

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:01.920
Thank you, Fabietto.

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:05.360
Is that your husband?

1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:08.840
The famous gynecologist?

1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:21.360
The bat’s in here.

1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:10.280
I’m in my room, Fabietto.

1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:33.040
Now sit down.

1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:48.040
How are you?

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.800
Do you miss your parents?

1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:56.120
What a shitty question!

1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:00.920
You’re right, it’s a shitty question.

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:06.640
Mama said you treated
your husband like a doormat.

1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:10.040
It’s not enough
to overhear a few quarrels.

1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:12.480
Truth is,

1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:17.200
you never know what's going on
in other people’s homes.

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:24.080
-Do you still think about your husband?
-Attiliuccio?

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:26.600
No, I’ve forgotten him.

1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:31.320
You’ll forget your mother and father too.

1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:33.320
No.

1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:36.480
I’ll never forget them.

1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:43.080
It’s time to look to the future.

1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:49.360
I’m going.

1:25:53.200 --> 1:25:54.880
Fabietto?

1:25:54.960 --> 1:25:56.600
If you don’t mind,

1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:00.160
could you bring me the brush
from my dresser?

1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:08.320
One last favor,

1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:12.040
would you brush my hair?

1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:42.000
Are you looking at me?

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:48.080
Yes.

1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:52.800
Okay, Fabietto, that’s enough.

1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:08.480
Why did you put it down?

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.400
-I’m done.
-Not quite yet.

1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:17.280
You still have to brush my slit.

1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.560
What do you mean, your slit?

1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:28.240
This is my slit.

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:33.960
Go on, brush it.

1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:59.760
Attiliuccio, who knew his way around,
called it "the super pussy."

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.400
Now put down the brush

1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:27.360
and get on top of me.

1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:50.200
Don’t look at me,
bury your face in my shoulder

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:53.240
and think about a girl you like.

1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:54.560
Okay.

1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:58.320
Now tell me, what’s her name?

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:01.400
-Patrizia.
-Good.

1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:04.640
Now you have to do two things.

1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:09.120
Move this way inside me…

1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:15.400
…and call me Patrizia.

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:21.960
You have to imagine the show,

1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:25.680
because you can’t change the channel now.

1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:34.520
Patrizia!

1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:11.320
Smoke this.

1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:15.560
It’s the best part of sex.

1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:27.920
Now go.

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.360
I really liked it. Next time…

1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:33.680
Next time will be
with a girl your own age.

1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:36.280
I accomplished my mission.

1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:39.760
What was your mission?

1:30:46.040 --> 1:30:48.800
To help you look to the future.

1:31:19.200 --> 1:31:22.040
We’re thinking of going to Stromboli
this summer.

1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:26.040
Wanna come?

1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:29.440
We'll see. 

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:46.640
You got laid.

1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:49.280
You did!

1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:00.600
Spartans!

1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:04.480
When death comes for me,

1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:07.680
I shall not be found.

1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:57.440
-You were great.
-Well done, Julia.

1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:03.040
I’m sorry, Capuano wanted to come,
but he couldn’t make it.

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:07.160
-Did I do something wrong?
-No, not at all!

1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:09.720
He’s just busy editing his film.

1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:11.800
So, he’s not coming anymore.

1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:30.360
-Dude! What ya doin’ here?
-I was at the theater.

1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:32.520
I ain’t seen you at the stadium again.

1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:34.760
I had some problems.

1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:36.200
-Hop on.
-Where?

1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:38.680
On the scooter! We’ll grab a beer.

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:40.000
No, tomorrow I…

1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:43.160
You don’t got shit to do. Hop on.

1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:50.000
Hold on, or you're gonna go splat.

1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:57.040
-Nice place.
-It’s a shithole.

1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:01.120
But the babes are hot.
I gotta a soft spot for hot babes.

1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:04.920
-Where did that hottie come from?
-She’s taken.

1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.000
The fuck do I care?

1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:15.800
You get it, beautiful lady.

1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:19.320
What?

1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:25.160
He said "your mother’s a whore."

1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.160
No, he asked what you want.

1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:30.280
I got ears, he said
"Your mother’s a whore."

1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:32.640
You said "Your mother’s a whore."

1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:34.840
You called my mom a whore!

1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:41.480
Armà, stop!

1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:49.200
Wasn’t expectin’ that. Let’s scram!

1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:51.720
-Yeah, but with dignity.
-Fuck dignity!

1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:02.320
I was so scared!

1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:06.080
Naples is so beautiful from here.

1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:09.880
What’s your name again?

1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:13.160
Fabietto Schisa.
You’re a smuggler, right?

1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:16.960
Yeah, but just for now.
I wanna pilot offshore boats.

1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:20.240
-And you?
-Maybe cinema.

1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:22.560
You wanna open a cinema?

1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:27.000
Awesome, I got this guy
who can get you some fast cash.

1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:31.040
-I’m afraid of falling off.
-Nobody falls with me.

1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:35.280
And…

1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.440
I’ve never seen anyone
kick someone with flip-flops.

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.080
That’s because you don’t know me!

1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:49.280
Get off.

1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:54.040
Come with me.

1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:56.480
Where are we going?

1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:00.560
We are goin’ to Capri, to dance.
20 minutes and we’re there.

1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:02.520
To Capri?

1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.760
Yeah, to Capri!
Just shut up and have fun!

1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:15.440
I have some stuff to do tomorrow.

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:18.120
Tomorrow you gotta sleep.

1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:21.160
Tonight we’re goin’ dancing. Hold on.

1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:35.120
I’m gonna show you somethin’ cool.

1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:47.800
Awesome!

1:37:55.400 --> 1:37:59.360
You know what sound an offshore boat
makes goin’ 200 km an hour?

1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:02.080
No, what?

1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:12.720
You’re nuts.

1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:17.040
I ain’t nuts, I’m young.

1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:20.120
Ain’t you?

1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:27.320
We screwed up, shoulda gone to Ischia.

1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:32.920
Capri’s totally dead,
I thought some places’d still be open.

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:36.000
Just as well.
I don’t even know how to dance.

1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:02.000
Khashoggi!

1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:07.040
Who the fuck’s that?

1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:08.640
The richest man in the world.

1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:09.920
Wait for me.

1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.600
And she’s… Wait, what’s her name?

1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:20.360
What are you looking at?

1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:23.560
I was just trying to remember your name.

1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:27.640
Eat shit.

1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:33.960
Let’s go for a dip.

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:45.320
You know what we've become tonight?

1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:48.040
No, what?

1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:50.040
Friends.

1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.640
When we’re back in Naples,
you can meet my sis.

1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:57.840
You can’t meet my ma,
‘cause I don’t even know her.

1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.120
My pa’s in the slammer,
but I could meet your parents.

1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:07.840
We can only do the first thing.

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:10.240
Why?

1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:16.320
I’m an orphan.

1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:57.160
-Armà, wanna come to Stromboli?
-No, I can’t. I got stuff to do.

1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:33.480
Rinse off.

1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:36.000
Feola’s waiting for you.

1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:53.920
<i>Which animals, still living today,</i>
<i>have been around the longest?</i>

1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:55.600
<i>Crocodiles.</i>

1:41:55.680 --> 1:41:57.480
<i>No, what a shame!</i>

1:43:44.680 --> 1:43:46.920
Why don’t you stay another week?

1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:51.960
No. It was hard enough
getting this ferry ticket.

1:43:56.240 --> 1:43:57.240
Be careful.

1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:04.680
Of what?

1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:09.160
Of everything.

1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:10.920
Listen, Marchino…

1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:15.760
Mama and Papa aren’t around anymore.

1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:18.720
And we're not rich.

1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:22.520
We’ve got to figure out
what we want to do next.

1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:28.200
No, Fabiè…

1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:33.360
I don’t wanna think about it.

1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:39.040
It’s summer, it’s August 9th.

1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:45.080
I wanna think about Gigliola,
about getting high, friends.

1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:50.280
I wanna think about happiness.

1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:54.120
Don’t you?

1:44:56.640 --> 1:44:57.720
Don’t you?

1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:02.720
I…

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.240
After what happened to Mama and Papa…

1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:18.720
I don’t know if I can be happy.

1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:23.400
Come here.

1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:00.160
Have a safe trip.

1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:39.440
How are you doing in here?

1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:43.200
Can’t complain.
I even get to see my pop in the yard.

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:48.040
How many years did you get?

1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:51.400
I gotta wait for the trial.

1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:55.000
Fifteen maybe, or ten.

1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:58.040
I don’t wanna talk about sad stuff.

1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:01.600
Then there’s nothing to talk about.

1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:03.760
You pissed off?

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:06.120
Orphans are always pissed off.

1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:12.160
Okay, fine, I got a ma and a pa,

1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:14.600
but I’m kinda an orphan too.

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.920
You feel alone, that’s the problem.

1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:21.280
But don’t forget that you’re free.

1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:22.760
Free!

1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:24.720
Don’t ever forget it.

1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:51.600
You know what sound
an offshore boat makes?

1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:52.600
No.

1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:20.000
You never wanted me
to kiss your mouth, Giovanni!

1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:22.920
Well, fine. I’ll kiss it now.

1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:28.960
I’ll bite it with my teeth
like one bites a ripe fruit!

1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:32.040
Giovanni, why won’t you look at me?

1:49:33.080 --> 1:49:37.040
Your terrible eyes,

1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:42.000
so full of anger and contempt,
are closed now!

1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:45.240
Lift up your eyelids, Giovanni!

1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:47.400
Julia, cut!

1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:51.280
-Who said that?
-Me, Capuano.

1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:54.200
Cut, Julia.

1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:57.240
You’ve entered into
the ornamental, zero nuance.

1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:59.520
You’re self-referential,
you’re unraveling.

1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:02.720
One final note, we're tired of your shit.

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.640
Bravo!

1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:11.840
You got the fuck off the stage!

1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:14.200
Now you deserve a round of applause.

1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:18.440
It's what they all wanted,
but they didn’t have the courage.

1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:25.120
Capuano! I’m Fabietto Schisa.

1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:26.800
What the fuck do I care?

1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:30.040
-I’m a huge fan of yours.
-I fucking hate fans.

1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:33.880
I like conflict,
without conflict you don’t progress.

1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:36.880
Without conflict, it’s just sex
and sex is useless.

1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:39.400
Wait!

1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:41.440
You still here?

1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:46.560
-What are you looking at?
-Looking is all I know how to do.

1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:48.760
What d'ya want from me?

1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:51.160
What do I want? Everything!

1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:56.400
That really shocked me, I didn’t know
you could protest at the theater.

1:50:56.480 --> 1:51:00.000
You can’t, but I do
whatever the fuck I want. I’m free.

1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:03.000
-Are you free?
-I’d prefer to answer later.

1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:07.320
-Do you have courage?
-A less difficult question?

1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:11.480
Remember, those without courage
don’t sleep with beautiful women.

1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:13.440
Listen, Capuano…

1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:18.040
Now that my family has disintegrated,
I don’t like life anymore.

1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:21.840
I don’t like it anymore,
I want an imaginary life,

1:51:21.920 --> 1:51:24.240
just like the one I had before.

1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:26.520
I don’t like reality anymore.

1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:28.040
Reality is lousy.

1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:30.600
That’s why I want to make films,

1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:33.520
even though
I’ve only seen three or four.

1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:38.040
Not enough, Schisa. It’s not enough.

1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:43.440
Films…
Everyone wants to make fucking films!

1:51:43.960 --> 1:51:47.240
To make films, you gotta have balls,
do you have balls?

1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:49.040
I rather doubt it.

1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:51.920
So you need pain. You got that?

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.960
Yes, I told you, on that front I’m good.

1:51:56.040 --> 1:51:58.800
What did you tell me? What pain?

1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:02.680
No, you don’t have pain, you have hope.

1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:06.520
With hope you make
comforting films, it’s a trap.

1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.960
They left me alone, that’s pain.

1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:12.560
It’s not enough, Schisa! We’re all alone.

1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:16.480
You’re alone? I don’t give a fuck,
because you’re not original.

1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:22.000
Forget pain and think about fun,
that’s how you’ll make films.

1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:26.000
But you gotta have something to say.
You got somethin'?

1:52:26.920 --> 1:52:31.760
Imagination, creativity are myths
that aren’t good for shit.

1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:36.080
I dunno if I have something to say.
How do I know?

1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:37.960
How the fuck do I know!

1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:41.200
I only got four things to say, and you?

1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:46.440
I want to go to Rome to see
if I’m cut out for making films.

1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:49.000
Rome? The great escape…

1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:54.120
Fucking distractions, in the end
you come back to yourself,

1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:58.640
you come back to failure,
everything’s a failure, a pile of shit.

1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:04.040
No one can escape his own failure
and no one gets outta this city.

1:53:04.680 --> 1:53:08.000
Rome…
What the fuck you gonna do in Rome?

1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:11.080
Only assholes go to Rome.

1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:14.400
Do you know how many stories
there are in this city?

1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:16.000
Look!

1:53:34.680 --> 1:53:39.040
Is it possible this city
doesn’t inspire you at all?

1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:42.720
So, you got somethin’ to say?

1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:45.320
Or are you an asshole
like everyone else?

1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:47.800
Got a story to tell?

1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:49.840
Have some guts!

1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:52.480
Got a story to tell or not?

1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:56.040
C’mon, you fool!
Got a story to tell?

1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:00.840
Find the guts to tell it! C’mon!

1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:04.680
-Got a story to tell?
-Yes!

1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:06.200
Then spit it out!

1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:11.200
When my parents died
they didn’t let me see them!

1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:22.560
Don’t come undone, Fabio.

1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:39.360
-Everyone calls me Fabietto.
-Time they start callin’ you Fabio.

1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:41.760
Don’t come undone.

1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:45.440
What does that mean?

1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:48.240
You gotta figure it out yourself.

1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:51.840
You gotta figure it out yourself,
you piece of shit!

1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:53.960
Don’t come undone, Schisa.

1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:57.920
Don’t ever come undone!
You can’t allow that.

1:54:58.000 --> 1:54:59.800
What does that mean? Why?

1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:03.760
Because they didn’t leave you alone.

1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:07.640
No?

1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:08.760
No!

1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.840
They abandoned you.

1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:18.320
Listen to me, don’t go to Rome.

1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:21.960
Come see me, I’m always here.

1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:24.960
We’ll make films together!

1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:12.440
<i>You wanted to greet</i>
<i>these marvelous fans personally.</i>

1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:14.600
<i>What did it feel like, Diego?</i>

1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:18.360
<i>The greatest thing in my life.</i>

1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:25.480
<i>The match is over!</i>
<i>Napoli wins the Italian championship!</i>

1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:06.280
<i>An incredibly exciting moment,</i>
<i>Napoli wins the Italian championship!</i>

1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:10.520
<i>It's a thrilling moment…</i>

2:00:24.040 --> 2:00:27.400
-Shall we go to Trastevere?
-I wanna go out to eat.

2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:29.360
-A nice carbonara.
-<i>Cacio e pepe</i>.

2:00:30.640 --> 2:00:33.440
-Excuse me, how much longer to Rome?
-One hour.

2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:30.080
