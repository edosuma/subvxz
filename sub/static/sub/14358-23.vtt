00:12.668 --> 00:15.370
Wow, you lost a ton of weight!

00:15.404 --> 00:17.605
<i>And some, not so much.</i>

00:17.639 --> 00:19.606
Did you hear that, mike?

00:19.641 --> 00:22.409
Brian's taken up running and
says it's changed his life.

00:22.443 --> 00:25.019
Yeah, I heard. I don't
really care about running.

00:25.053 --> 00:26.238
aah.

00:26.273 --> 00:29.249
But did you see the shoes
she wore on Wednesday?

00:29.284 --> 00:30.728
<i>to die for.</i>

00:30.762 --> 00:33.104
How many pairs do
you think she has?

00:33.139 --> 00:34.608
That was fun.

00:34.643 --> 00:35.880
Yep.

00:35.915 --> 00:37.384
Kinda late, though.

00:37.418 --> 00:40.394
I was ready to go an hour ago.
I guess you missed my signal.

00:40.428 --> 00:41.933
I missed your signal?

00:41.967 --> 00:43.402
<i>I missed your signal?</i>

00:43.437 --> 00:44.907
oh, that's hilarious.

00:44.941 --> 00:46.912
I gave you so many signals,

00:46.946 --> 00:48.851
Other people's husbands
were responding.

00:48.885 --> 00:50.955
What are you talking about?

00:50.989 --> 00:53.092
Mike, you didn't hear yourself.

00:53.126 --> 00:56.534
You can't just say every thought
that pops into your head.

00:56.568 --> 00:59.039
Aw, come on. Are we
really gonna go here?

00:59.074 --> 01:01.043
Look, we're 20 years in.

01:01.077 --> 01:03.581
We got 20, 30 more,
and we're done.

01:03.615 --> 01:06.387
Can't we just ride
it out till then?

01:06.421 --> 01:09.363
And why are you so worried about it?
I said it, not you.

01:09.398 --> 01:12.371
Yeah, but you're a reflection of me.
I married you.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.379
I picked you. When you start
saying stuff like that,

01:15.413 --> 01:17.718
It's like my own arm suddenly
starts flapping uncontrollably,

01:17.753 --> 01:20.726
And there's nothing I can do to stop it.
Well, I must be doing something right.

01:20.761 --> 01:22.730
People keep inviting
us to parties.

01:22.765 --> 01:25.596
Our party's coming
up in a few weeks.

01:25.631 --> 01:27.990
People come to that.
I'm very social there.

01:28.025 --> 01:29.920
you're confusing
yourself with me.

01:29.955 --> 01:31.857
I talk. I make the chitchat.

01:31.891 --> 01:34.293
You cling to the
grill and ask people

01:34.327 --> 01:37.164
If they want cheese on that. You knew
what you were getting when you bought
me.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.069
I-I guarantee you, peoe are
going home right now saying,

01:40.104 --> 01:42.507
"can you believe mike said that?
How inappropriate!"

01:42.541 --> 01:44.943
<i>Or they're saying, "poor mike.
What a great guy.</i>

01:44.978 --> 01:48.480
Too bad he's married
to that shrew."

01:48.515 --> 01:51.318
Oh, yeah? Well, read this sign.

01:51.353 --> 01:53.722
<i>yep, some signs are
unmistakable,</i>

01:53.757 --> 01:56.092
<i>Like those that signify the
coming of spring,</i>

01:56.126 --> 01:59.025
<i>When the teenage boy wakes from
his long winter slumber</i>

01:59.059 --> 02:01.495
<i>And comes out of hibernation
to forage for food.</i>

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:15.748 --> 02:18.852
It's spring!

02:18.887 --> 02:22.291
Hey, dad, when are you cleaning
the pool for the barbecue?

02:22.325 --> 02:25.061
Coming up soon! Eh, I don't know.
That's a lot of hassle.

02:25.095 --> 02:28.800
Maybe we'll just skip the pool. What?
No! No, you gotta clean the sweet
aboveground pool.

02:28.834 --> 02:30.635
Yeah, well,
that pool's turned into

02:30.670 --> 02:32.471
A sweet aboveground
frog habitat.

02:32.505 --> 02:34.906
It's the kickoff to the
whole orson bikini season.

02:34.941 --> 02:37.776
If our family can turn our
back on this tradition,

02:37.811 --> 02:39.779
Then I don't know what
we stand for anymore.

02:39.813 --> 02:44.884
Great. I have a new tradition.
You clean it. I'm off. Bye.

02:44.919 --> 02:47.320
We have brick's thing
after school today.

02:47.355 --> 02:49.656
Oh, yes. The odd squad pageant.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.558
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

02:51.593 --> 02:53.895
Oh, sue, I was
talking to mrs. Hagen

02:53.929 --> 02:56.030
At the party last night,
and she told me

02:56.065 --> 02:57.999
That her daughter's in
the church youth group

02:58.034 --> 03:01.670
And really likes it. Youth group?
Isn't that sorta for geeks and losers?

03:01.704 --> 03:04.507
Axl! I think you should
give it a chance.

03:04.541 --> 03:06.476
You're always wanting
to join something,

03:06.510 --> 03:08.846
And there's no
tryouts for jesus.

03:08.881 --> 03:10.281
Don't worry.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.250
Mom gets on these kicks
where she feels guilty,

03:12.284 --> 03:14.152
Li she's gotta bea bett.

03:14.186 --> 03:16.120
She'll take you a few times,

03:16.154 --> 03:18.055
But she'll get tired
of driving you.

03:18.089 --> 03:19.924
You won't have to go anymore.

03:19.958 --> 03:21.359
Welcome, parents,

03:21.393 --> 03:23.294
To the first spring
social-skills-a-thon.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.063
We at the social skills group
are very excited to show you

03:26.098 --> 03:27.999
The wonderful
progress we've made.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.500
First up,

03:29.534 --> 03:32.236
<i>Brick and zack will demonstrate a
reciprocal conversation.</i>

03:32.271 --> 03:33.738
Boys.

03:35.942 --> 03:37.876
Hi, brick. How are you?

03:37.911 --> 03:40.446
Fine. Thanks for asking, zack.
How are you?

03:40.480 --> 03:42.948
I'm fine.

03:46.686 --> 03:49.756
How much are we paying
for this again? Mike.

03:49.790 --> 03:52.192
N-now I know this all
looks easy, parents,

03:52.226 --> 03:54.127
But social interactions
can be awkward

03:54.161 --> 03:57.063
For people who don't inherently
pick up the signals or cues

03:57.098 --> 03:59.032
Most of us te for granted.

03:59.066 --> 04:02.035
Not knowing the right
thing to say at a party

04:02.069 --> 04:05.138
Or other group situation
can lead to hurt feelings.

04:05.172 --> 04:08.141
First, let's show
everyone the wrong way.

04:11.345 --> 04:13.413
Hello. Can I join your group?

04:13.447 --> 04:16.850
Sure. Henry was just
talking about baseball.

04:16.884 --> 04:18.819
I don't really care
about baseball.

04:18.853 --> 04:20.754
I'm done talking to you now.

04:20.788 --> 04:22.589
uh-oh!

04:24.090 --> 04:26.491
it's funny, isn't it?

04:26.525 --> 04:28.891
That's because we, as adults,
know it's not okay.

04:28.926 --> 04:31.860
Now let's show
them the right way.

04:31.895 --> 04:34.362
<i>Oh. I don't know much
about baseball,</i>

04:34.396 --> 04:37.364
But I'd be very interested in
hearing what you have to say.

04:39.601 --> 04:41.568
You see, parents,

04:41.603 --> 04:44.571
Even if we're not interested
in what others are saying,

04:44.605 --> 04:47.506
We can't tell them that,
or people will think we're rude.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.675
Oh. Hmm.

04:49.709 --> 04:52.511
Hmm. Excuse me.

04:52.545 --> 04:55.747
Is there a height
limit for this class?

04:58.739 --> 05:00.539
<i>Sometimes the point
is so obvious,</i>

05:00.574 --> 05:02.440
<i>You don't have to say it.</i>

05:02.474 --> 05:04.208
Say it. Just say it.

05:04.242 --> 05:06.476
I knew it wasn't my
side of the family.

05:06.511 --> 05:08.979
You're always blaming me
for brick being short.

05:09.013 --> 05:11.781
I'm just saying, he might have
gotten a few things from you.

05:11.815 --> 05:15.150
You wanna go down this road?
We can go down this road.

05:15.185 --> 05:17.519
Let's go kid by kid.
Axl's knees--your family.

05:17.554 --> 05:19.254
Sue's teeth--your family.

05:19.289 --> 05:21.855
Brick's snoring... you again.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.422
Yeah, we don't have to go
down the road. Okay then.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.491
You know what you know.

05:26.525 --> 05:28.826
Hey, I was very soci aid.

05:28.860 --> 05:31.227
We-liked, pi first on evy team.

05:31.262 --> 05:33.129
Of course they're
gonna pick you.

05:33.163 --> 05:35.762
You're a freakin' skyscraper.
Brick doesn't have that luxury.

05:35.797 --> 05:37.530
Ur shrimpy genes, not mine.

05:37.565 --> 05:39.898
It's not just about
the genes, mike.

05:39.932 --> 05:42.265
Kids watch.
They watch and learn.

05:42.299 --> 05:45.033
I know, I know. I get it.
I need to set a better example.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.868
I'll do it for brick.

05:46.902 --> 05:49.237
That way,
some day in the future,

05:49.271 --> 05:51.572
He won't ever have to
have this conversation

05:51.607 --> 05:54.208
With his wife.

05:54.243 --> 05:56.143
<i>Well, spri'se for beginnings,</i>

05:56.178 --> 05:58.212
<i>And suwas giving youth
group a try.</i>

05:58.247 --> 06:01.249
<i>I mean, I want to be a good
parent and everything,</i>

06:01.283 --> 06:03.984
<i>But it was kind of a pain
to have to drive her.</i>

06:04.019 --> 06:06.086
oh. Ohh.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.320
Do you need some help?

06:08.354 --> 06:11.156
oh, thanks. Uh,
this happens all the time.

06:11.157 --> 06:13.058
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

06:15.460 --> 06:16.860
There.

06:16.894 --> 06:18.896
Oh, hey. Thanks!

06:18.930 --> 06:20.330
No problem.

06:20.364 --> 06:22.732
Hey, guys. Uh, let's
everybody come on up front,

06:22.766 --> 06:25.667
And, um, let's get these
chairs out of the way,

06:25.702 --> 06:27.669
Make a peace circle.

06:29.939 --> 06:32.440
Hey, what happened
to reverend hayver?

06:32.474 --> 06:34.875
Oh, he doesn't lead
the youth group.

06:34.910 --> 06:36.277
He does.

06:36.311 --> 06:37.778
<i>Really?</i>

06:37.812 --> 06:39.212
okay.

06:39.247 --> 06:43.016
For all you new guys,
my name is reverend timtom.

06:43.050 --> 06:46.653
Well, actually, my name is
reverend timothy thomas,

06:46.687 --> 06:49.049
But my friends-
and you are my friends--

06:49.083 --> 06:51.049
Call me reverend timtom.

06:51.050 --> 06:53.784
let's rap about
what's on your minds.

06:53.819 --> 06:55.685
* it's tough being a teen *

06:55.720 --> 06:57.887
*hen this world can be so mean *

06:57.921 --> 06:59.755
* no one takes you seriously *

06:59.789 --> 07:02.124
* you say, "who will
understand me?" *

07:02.158 --> 07:04.426
* when the world tells
you you're nothin' *

07:04.460 --> 07:06.227
* just remember that
you'rsomethin' *

07:06.261 --> 07:09.796
* yeah, it tough being a teen *

07:09.831 --> 07:12.265
* yeah, it's tough *

07:12.299 --> 07:13.666
* being a teen *

07:13.700 --> 07:16.634
*

07:24.206 --> 07:26.576
Oh. Now if we could
just convince him

07:26.611 --> 07:29.112
That cleaning out the
garage would get him girls,

07:29.146 --> 07:31.046
We'd be on to something.

07:31.081 --> 07:33.381
The urge to mate is a
powerful incentive, frankie.

07:33.416 --> 07:36.083
Makes men do crazy things.
Makes men marry.

07:36.118 --> 07:38.152
You know what else is powerful?

07:38.186 --> 07:41.020
Love and fellowship
and understanding.

07:41.054 --> 07:43.821
A lot of forces at play
in this complicated rld.

07:43.856 --> 07:46.790
It's tough being
a teen right now.

07:46.824 --> 07:48.224
Tougbeing a teen.

07:54.198 --> 07:58.066
Hey, buddy. Proud of the
good work you d yesterday.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.236
Looks like you really
learned a lot in the class.

08:01.270 --> 08:03.104
Yep. So I'm done now, right?

08:03.138 --> 08:05.438
I worked out all
my social issues?

08:05.473 --> 08:07.039
social issues.

08:07.074 --> 08:09.340
Well, son,
you're never really done.

08:09.375 --> 08:12.110
You caalways try  to bett.

08:12.144 --> 08:15.781
I think I'm obablyas g.

08:15.815 --> 08:18.582
We didhe thing,
got thzza party. I'm done.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.121
Here's the thing, brick.

08:25.155 --> 08:27.989
Everyone can always
improve, evene.

08:28.024 --> 08:31.993
I might not always set
the best example for you.

08:32.027 --> 08:34.628
I'm not always the
most social guy.

08:34.662 --> 08:37.429
Budon't get me wrong.
I was popular, really popular.

08:37.464 --> 08:38.831
Wow.

08:38.865 --> 08:41.666
The stripes on your shirt are
thicker going up and down

08:41.700 --> 08:43.567
And then thinner going sideways.

08:43.601 --> 08:46.635
Lo, brick, we got this
big barbecue coming up.

08:46.669 --> 08:49.470
What do you say you
d me go out there

08:49.505 --> 08:51.472
<i>And really try to be social.</i>

08:51.506 --> 08:53.306
It'll be like our
spring training!

08:53.340 --> 08:56.075
Our what? Is that a spts thing?

08:56.109 --> 08:57.909
Yeah, sports.

08:57.944 --> 09:00.513
I don't know much  ,

09:00.547 --> 09:03.316
But I'd be interested in
hearing what you have to say.

09:03.350 --> 09:04.616
Attaboy!

09:08.154 --> 09:12.758
* jesus was a teenager, too *

09:12.792 --> 09:16.061
* beneathhe long hair,
awkwardness and pimples *

09:16.096 --> 09:17.996
* king of the jews *

09:18.030 --> 09:22.836
* a lonely teenage savior
no one could understand *

09:22.870 --> 09:25.205
* awkward on the outside *

09:25.239 --> 09:27.840
* but inside, a wise young man *

09:27.875 --> 09:32.378
* yeah, jesus was
a teenager, too *

09:32.413 --> 09:34.281
Mm, yes, he was.

09:34.316 --> 09:36.651
He was. He was.

09:36.685 --> 09:38.085
Mahalo.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.588
Hangoo, everybody.

09:42.261 --> 09:44.162
Um...

09:44.197 --> 09:47.198
Reverend ttom,
can I ask you something?

09:47.232 --> 09:49.132
Sure. What's on your mind?

09:49.167 --> 09:50.600
Reverend timtom,

09:50.634 --> 09:53.435
Are we still going on
the field trip next week

09:53.469 --> 09:55.837
To explore all god's wonders? Yes,
we are, marcy,

09:55.871 --> 09:57.805
But I was talking to
this young lady first.

09:57.839 --> 10:00.541
Um, reverend timtom,
I was wondering

10:00.542 --> 10:03.376
If you'd like to come to
our barbecue this weekend.

10:03.411 --> 10:05.412
You can bring your guitar.

10:05.413 --> 10:06.880
Aw, that'd be beautiful.

10:06.914 --> 10:09.881
Ll be moving to my next
parish after the field trip,

10:09.916 --> 10:12.384
That'll be a nice
good-bye for me,

10:12.418 --> 10:14.453
Give me a good send-off.

10:18.157 --> 10:20.959
Is that true?
Is reverend timtom leaving?

10:20.993 --> 10:23.294
Yeah, I heard since they
refinished the pews,

10:23.328 --> 10:25.662
The parish doesn't have
enough money to keep him.

10:25.696 --> 10:28.330
But he gets me.

10:37.547 --> 10:39.748
<i>Sue was devastated to be
losing reverend timtom</i>

10:42.517 --> 10:44.451
<i>But,ue being sue,
was not gonna give up.</i>

10:47.021 --> 10:48.588
Hi, m coecting money

10:48.622 --> 10:51.557
To keep reverendimtom
in the church.

10:51.591 --> 10:54.027
He really gets teens.

10:54.061 --> 10:55.962
<i>The heck barbecue was
in full swing.</i>

10:55.997 --> 10:58.365
<i>Axl's right. It's the kickoff
to ors bikini season,</i>

10:58.399 --> 11:02.937
<i>And you just can't turn your back
on that kind of tradition.</i>

11:02.971 --> 11:04.872
God, what is going on?

11:04.906 --> 11:06.841
It's supposed to be spring!

11:06.875 --> 11:09.243
Where is global warming
when you need it?

11:09.277 --> 11:11.712
Hey! Come on in the pool,
ladies.

11:11.746 --> 11:14.214
I'll hold your
sweatshirts while you go

11:14.249 --> 11:17.050
Des, u ne to move more!

11:17.084 --> 11:18.952
Splash around. Make it look fun.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.622
Ohh.

11:21.656 --> 11:23.258
All right. So we're clear?

11:23.293 --> 11:25.162
A lot of backseat
grillers are gonna come up

11:25.196 --> 11:27.096
And try to tell you hoto do it,

11:27.130 --> 11:29.631
But you gotta stay focused
and do wt I told you.

11:29.665 --> 11:31.532
keep your mind on the meat.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.967
Thank you, mike.

11:33.001 --> 11:35.035
It's an honor to be
trusted with your grill.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.437
My dad never let me
anywhere near ours.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.240
He would squirt me
with a spray bottle.

11:43.675 --> 11:47.110
Okay. all right. Here we go.

11:47.144 --> 11:48.311
Oh.

11:48.345 --> 11:49.812
There we go.

11:49.847 --> 11:52.782
Brick! Ready to hit this
party and socialize?

11:52.817 --> 11:54.818
What are we gonna do?

11:54.852 --> 11:57.187
Look people in the eye.

11:57.221 --> 12:01.189
What are we not gonna do? Walk away
while people are still talking to us!

12:01.224 --> 12:03.358
All right. Mingle on three.
One! Two...

12:03.392 --> 12:05.959
Is that a sports thing again?

12:05.994 --> 12:08.295
Seriously, brick,
you read a hundred books a day.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.297
Can't one of 'em
be about sports?

12:10.331 --> 12:13.433
<i>I was really touched
watching them.</i>

12:13.467 --> 12:14.901
<i>Two socially awkward
creatures--</i>

12:14.935 --> 12:16.503
<i>One giant, one tiny--</i>

12:16.537 --> 12:19.539
<i>Clearly out of their element,
but willing to try.</i>

12:19.574 --> 12:22.574
<i>I just hoped they did better
than bob at the grill.</i>

12:28.379 --> 12:29.913
You're kidding!

12:29.947 --> 12:32.416
So you have ancestors
from France and belgium?

12:32.450 --> 12:34.352
Yes.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.253
Genealogy is so fascinating,
don't you think?

12:36.287 --> 12:38.655
Well, I don't know
much about that,

12:38.689 --> 12:41.856
<i>But I'd be very interested in
hearing what you have to say.</i>

12:41.891 --> 12:45.559
Hi. My name's brick.
So what do you like to do?

12:45.593 --> 12:47.326
aah!

12:55.568 --> 12:57.635
Reverend timtom! You showed up!

12:57.669 --> 13:00.038
Well, why wouldn't I?
You invited me.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.239
Well, I invite people
to a lot of things.

13:02.274 --> 13:05.544
They don't always show up.

13:05.578 --> 13:07.045
I like you.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.514
I like you, too.

13:08.548 --> 13:09.916
You're a good listener.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.383
You're a good talker.

13:11.418 --> 13:13.317
I've never met
anyone as interested

13:13.353 --> 13:15.018
In growing winter
squash as I am.

13:15.053 --> 13:17.120
Until now, I've known
little about the topic,

13:17.155 --> 13:19.454
But I've thoroughly
enjoyed this conversation.

13:19.489 --> 13:21.822
this isn't working.

13:21.857 --> 13:23.290
My body's not good

13:23.324 --> 13:25.225
At regulating its
own temperature.

13:25.259 --> 13:27.828
Maybe if we move closer,
it'll get warmer.

13:40.439 --> 13:42.341
*

13:42.375 --> 13:44.276
* it's tough being a teen *

13:44.310 --> 13:46.311
* when this world
can be so mean *

13:46.345 --> 13:48.347
* no one takes you seriously *

13:48.381 --> 13:50.748
* you say, "who will
understand me?" *

13:50.783 --> 13:53.418
Whoa. Who's the weird old
loser playing guitar?

13:53.452 --> 13:55.786
Could this geezer
be any more lame?

13:55.820 --> 13:58.655
What do you say we hit the pool?

14:00.156 --> 14:02.124
Hey, you wanna lose
the sweatshirt,

14:02.158 --> 14:05.026
And I could rub some
suntan lotion on your back,

14:05.060 --> 14:06.960
Or... You could do mine?

14:06.994 --> 14:09.161
We could set up a
suntan lotion train!

14:09.195 --> 14:11.495
* and on that day,
you'll stand and shout *

14:11.529 --> 14:14.297
Uh, hey! Look at those guys
in the pool. That looks fun.

14:15.633 --> 14:19.533
* yeah, it's tough
being a teen *

14:19.567 --> 14:23.468
* well, it's tough
being a teen *

14:24.970 --> 14:27.805
Oh! Hi, sorry. I was just
looking for a serving spoon

14:27.839 --> 14:29.873
For the macaroni salad.

14:29.907 --> 14:32.074
Um, I think it should be...

14:32.109 --> 14:33.309
Right here.

14:33.343 --> 14:36.245
Oh. How about that?
Got it on the first try.

14:36.279 --> 14:37.679
thanks.

14:37.714 --> 14:40.214
Need some help carrying
this stuff out?

14:40.249 --> 14:42.183
Oh, that'd be great. Thanks.

14:42.217 --> 14:44.652
I asked brian to
come in and help me,

14:44.686 --> 14:47.454
But I don't think
he even heard me.

14:47.488 --> 14:50.523
But that's pretty typical
these days. I understand.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.791
Really? Did you sense something

14:52.825 --> 14:55.158
The other night at
the dinner party,

14:55.193 --> 14:57.560
'cause he's just... Y-- no.
You know what? Sorry.

14:57.594 --> 15:00.461
I don't want to bore you with
my relationship troubles.

15:00.496 --> 15:02.963
Oh, I don't know
much about that,

15:02.997 --> 15:06.198
<i>But I'd be very interested in hearing
what you have to say. You would?</i>

15:06.233 --> 15:09.435
I think we got off on the
wrong foot last time.

15:09.469 --> 15:11.936
I brought you some cake.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.871
Uhh!

15:14.905 --> 15:18.173
forks are inside.

15:20.175 --> 15:22.910
It's like you wanted
all these things,

15:22.944 --> 15:26.446
But then you can't remember
what it was you wanted.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.381
I hear you.

15:28.415 --> 15:30.149
It's like something's missing.

15:30.183 --> 15:31.817
You're--you're restless.

15:31.851 --> 15:34.718
Sure. I've had that
feeling myself.

15:34.753 --> 15:36.786
You have?

15:36.821 --> 15:39.722
Wow. I just... Feel like
you get me in a way that--

15:39.757 --> 15:43.658
Ll, no one has gotten
me in a very long time.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.359
I'm glad.

15:46.393 --> 15:48.026
God, mike.

15:48.060 --> 15:50.026
The way you're looking at me...

15:50.061 --> 15:52.528
You've never looked
at me like this.

15:52.562 --> 15:54.362
Thanks for noticing.

15:54.396 --> 15:55.863
This is crazy.

15:55.897 --> 15:57.865
You wake up in the morning,

15:57.899 --> 16:00.667
And you think your
life's gonna go one way,

16:00.702 --> 16:05.574
And then it takea rn
you didn't expect.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.668
So, how do you wanna play this?

16:10.723 --> 16:12.172
I'm done talking to you now.

16:16.396 --> 16:18.831
Frankie, seriously,
give me another chance.

16:18.866 --> 16:21.835
I got distracted when
that guy started singing.

16:21.870 --> 16:24.372
It was like he was
speaking to me.

16:24.407 --> 16:27.308
There was no way I was letting
bob near the grill again.

16:27.343 --> 16:29.810
I had looked for
mike to take over,

16:29.845 --> 16:32.446
But he and brick seemed
to have disappeared.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.648
Socializing is hard.

16:34.682 --> 16:37.684
Harder than I thought.
What happened to you?

16:37.718 --> 16:41.220
I offered a boy cake,
and he punched me.

16:41.255 --> 16:43.655
I got offered somethin', too.

16:43.723 --> 16:45.657
You know, buddy,
I've been thinking.

16:45.725 --> 16:48.592
Maybe we're meant to be
who we're meant to be,

16:48.627 --> 16:51.627
And it's when we start trying
to change who we're meant to be

16:51.661 --> 16:53.562
That things get mess up.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.498
It sounds like an excuse,
but mom'd probably fall for it.

16:56.532 --> 16:59.067
No, I mean it.
Brick, are you happy?

16:59.101 --> 17:01.068
Yes. Are you happy?

17:01.102 --> 17:02.469
Yes.

17:02.504 --> 17:05.472
So why are we letting
people try to change us?

17:05.539 --> 17:08.106
We're fine just the way we are.

17:08.141 --> 17:11.141
So do I still have to
go to the social group?

17:11.175 --> 17:14.009
Eh, brick, that's kinda
your mom's thing.

17:14.042 --> 17:16.544
She wants you to go.
Just go for now.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.380
Eventually she'll get
tired of driving you.

17:23.685 --> 17:25.853
Spring sucks.

17:27.423 --> 17:30.025
Reverend timtom?

17:30.060 --> 17:31.994
I was trying to raise money

17:32.028 --> 17:34.563
So the church could
afford to keep you.

17:34.597 --> 17:35.964
I tried my best,

17:35.998 --> 17:38.533
But I only raised 6
dollars and 12 cents.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.935
Will this keep you
here another week?

17:40.969 --> 17:43.937
At least until I get my bake sale up
and running? Aw, honey, I'm not leaving

17:43.971 --> 17:46.371
'cause the church
can't affo to keep me.

17:46.405 --> 17:48.773
I'm leaving because
I gotta keep roving.

17:48.808 --> 17:51.242
It's who I am.
I'm timtom, the roving rev.

17:51.276 --> 17:54.345
I hear there's a lot of
troubled teens in dayton,

17:54.379 --> 17:56.214
So I gotta move on.

17:56.248 --> 17:58.750
But I just found you,
and now you're leaving.

17:58.784 --> 18:00.184
You gave me hope,

18:00.218 --> 18:02.653
But now everything
just seems impossible.

18:02.687 --> 18:05.890
You know, if you take the
"im" off of "impossible,"

18:05.924 --> 18:07.324
What do you get?

18:07.359 --> 18:09.860
Im. No, the other half.

18:09.894 --> 18:11.594
Possible.

18:11.662 --> 18:14.430
That's right, sue heck.
possible!

18:14.464 --> 18:17.100
You remembered my name.

18:17.135 --> 18:20.237
You only met me twice,
and you remembered my name!

18:20.271 --> 18:22.339
That's why you have to stay.

18:22.373 --> 18:23.707
You get me!

18:23.741 --> 18:27.410
When you go to dayton,
what's gonna happen to me?

18:27.444 --> 18:30.780
I'll tell you what's gonna
happen to you, sue heck.

18:30.814 --> 18:35.952
* you're gonna be just fine *

18:35.986 --> 18:40.288
* you're gonna be all right *

18:41.123 --> 18:44.858
* you don't have
to change a thing *

18:44.892 --> 18:48.560
* you're super keen
and outta sight *

18:48.595 --> 18:51.929
* you heard it from
reverend timtom *

18:51.964 --> 18:56.200
* don't let people
drag you down *

18:56.235 --> 18:58.336
* there's a power up there *

18:58.370 --> 19:00.971
* can you feel it now? *

19:01.006 --> 19:03.707
* don't let them
try to change you *

19:03.741 --> 19:06.176
* don't let 'em chip
away at who you are *

19:07.910 --> 19:11.312
It's a miracle! Thank you,
old guitar dude!

19:11.346 --> 19:12.747
whoo-hoo! Yeah!

19:12.781 --> 19:15.349
* don't let thetry
to change you *

19:15.384 --> 19:17.351
yeah! The sun's out!

19:20.288 --> 19:23.323
*

19:23.357 --> 19:25.191
Oh, mike!

19:25.225 --> 19:28.394
You looked into her eyes and
told her you understand?

19:28.428 --> 19:30.830
You can't do that to a woman.

19:30.864 --> 19:32.297
Yeah, apparently not.

19:32.332 --> 19:35.400
I guess all this
with a personality

19:35.435 --> 19:36.835
Is too much.

19:36.869 --> 19:39.436
I need to hold some back.

19:39.471 --> 19:43.905
Honestly, though, nothing happened.
Stop saying that. I know.

19:43.939 --> 19:45.706
Really? Yeah.

19:48.576 --> 19:51.410
I know you're never gonna lie to me.
That's the flip side to having a
husbanoh, you don't know that.

19:51.444 --> 19:54.513
Yes, I do. You don't know.
Lot of opportunities out there

19:54.547 --> 19:57.451
For a guy like me who
knows how to listen.

20:00.088 --> 20:04.092
* I'm done talking to you now.

20:04.126 --> 20:07.195
I've been looking for you.
You know,

20:07.229 --> 20:10.198
Some people like to use
ladybugs as their pest control.

20:10.232 --> 20:12.233
I like poison.

20:12.267 --> 20:15.369
Good old american poison.

20:15.403 --> 20:19.106
Yeah, mike and brick were never
gonna be social butterflies,

20:19.140 --> 20:20.873
But when times got rough,

20:20.907 --> 20:23.842
They figured a way to
help each other out.

20:23.876 --> 20:26.111
...Stock up with
root vegetables,

20:26.145 --> 20:29.214
Like potatoes and rutabagas-- dad,
I am terribly sorry to interrupt,

20:29.249 --> 20:31.150
But I have an emergency
that requires

20:31.184 --> 20:35.520
Your immediate attention
over there. I'm sorry.

20:35.554 --> 20:39.190
My son needs my help.
Another time?

20:39.258 --> 20:41.292
Uh, I-I look forward to it.

20:41.326 --> 20:45.029
*

20:48.334 --> 20:51.270
* fine the way you are *

20:51.304 --> 20:55.274
* gonna be fine
the way you are *

20:55.309 --> 20:56.912
* gonna be fine *
