WEBVTT

00:04.213 --> 00:07.883
Ya gotta admit, things are going
pretty well since I took over.

00:08.259 --> 00:10.094
Certainly a lot smoother lately.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.971
And based on my surveillance

00:12.096 --> 00:14.098
our four humans don't suspect
anything.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.392
Yeah, because we're killing it.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.019
Wooo-hoo-hoo!

00:18.185 --> 00:19.270
You sure are.

00:19.437 --> 00:22.773
Here are the torture ideas you asked me
to write up for next week.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.442
Ugh...

00:24.984 --> 00:26.027
So long.

00:26.152 --> 00:27.820
You're not supposed to be torturing me.

00:27.945 --> 00:32.033
From now on, make all your memos one page,
max... with pictures.

00:32.283 --> 00:37.079
Also, Quinston over here already came up with
a sick idea for how to torture Tahani.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.080
Tell him, babe.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.750
We're gonna have Tahani throw a party
for Gunnar's birthday

00:40.791 --> 00:44.128
but no one will show up,
because we'll also be throwing a party

00:44.170 --> 00:45.463
and it'll be way better!

00:45.504 --> 00:46.964
Boom!

00:47.006 --> 00:49.425
Where do you get these incredible ideas?

00:49.467 --> 00:50.509
That one just came to me.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.262
- It just, like, popped right into my noodle.
- Yeah, that's right!

00:55.264 --> 00:56.265
- Up top!
- Oh!

00:56.474 --> 00:57.600
So, that's their plan.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.518
This doesn't seem so bad.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.979
Yeah, it really tugs my nuggets.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.273
I worked so hard on my torture ideas

01:04.315 --> 01:05.649
and theirs are so basic.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.235
These Millennials, they have no work ethic.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.404
Oh, sorry, a...

01:10.613 --> 01:12.990
a "millennial" is someone who's only been
torturing people

01:13.032 --> 01:14.241
for a thousand years.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.118
"Millennial."

01:23.042 --> 01:24.335
OK, coast is clear.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.420
Not a demon in sight.

01:26.462 --> 01:27.671
Except for, you know...

01:27.755 --> 01:29.757
Is that what we should call you?
"Demon?"

01:29.799 --> 01:33.177
Well, I mean, it's not really accurate
and we consider it to be...

01:33.219 --> 01:34.428
a little racist.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.346
But it's fine.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.766
Well, um, let's start our first lesson.

01:39.100 --> 01:43.312
Tahani and Jason will have to make it up
since they're both off being fake-tortured.

01:43.354 --> 01:48.567
I'd like to mention again that a "being"
like me studying human ethics is pointless.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.613
Wouldn't you rather I work on the plans
to get us all to the real Good Place?

01:52.822 --> 01:53.697
Nope.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.866
This is school, that's your after-school job.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.828
If I could bartend when I was 11,
you can handle this.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.497
Alright, well, I've read everything
on your syllabus

02:01.539 --> 02:03.624
and how... how do I put this delicately?

02:03.999 --> 02:04.875
It's all...

02:05.292 --> 02:06.460
stupid garbage.

02:06.502 --> 02:10.172
Ah, well, are there any philosophers
that you found interesting?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.550
Lao-Tzu? Buddha? Plato?

02:12.591 --> 02:13.634
Nope. No.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.177
They're all dumdums.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.263
And terrible writers!

02:17.304 --> 02:18.889
So hard to understand.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.724
I am with you there, dog.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.018
- Mm.
- Look, we have to start somewhere

02:23.060 --> 02:25.271
so how about Socrates?

02:25.354 --> 02:26.438
alright, alright...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.941
let me just get into the mind-set of a human.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.861
"Ha, ha... Oh, I'm a human..."

02:31.902 --> 02:34.947
"and my breathing tube
is next to my eating tube."

02:35.156 --> 02:38.742
"Oh, and look!
My arms end in stupid little sticks!"

02:39.326 --> 02:41.287
OK. Proceed.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.538
Good.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.665
Ugh, this is so depressing.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.710
I'm being forced to throw a party
that I know will fail.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.589
Well, why don't you let me handle it?
I'm great at failing at stuff. Uh, Janet?

02:51.672 --> 02:52.882
Hi there!

02:52.923 --> 02:55.009
Hi! Me and Tahani are throwing a rager.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.760
So, we're going to need the essentials

02:56.802 --> 02:58.846
chips, salsa, a tank of nitrous

02:58.888 --> 02:59.847
a treasure map

02:59.889 --> 03:01.515
water-skis, a boat, water

03:01.557 --> 03:02.892
those zappy-paddles for your chest

03:02.933 --> 03:04.059
a big snake, obviously...

03:04.101 --> 03:07.229
No, no, no, ignore all of that, Janet.
Please just design a basic dinner party.

03:08.522 --> 03:12.318
I know this sucks, but I think you're great
at throwing parties.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.195
That's why they're doing this.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.446
It's what you're best at.

03:15.487 --> 03:19.783
Just like I'm the best at getting empty water
bottles to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.118
You know what?

03:21.702 --> 03:22.828
You're absolutely right.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.580
We should get a big snake?!
- No.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.790
I am the best at planning parties.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.793
Vicky may be some demonic torturer
from the netherworld

03:29.835 --> 03:32.087
but does she have taste, sophistication

03:32.296 --> 03:34.423
an encyclopaedic knowledge of
traditional and avant-garde

03:34.465 --> 03:35.382
Belgian floral design?

03:35.507 --> 03:37.092
Yes, she does!

03:38.385 --> 03:40.596
No, she doesn't.

03:40.638 --> 03:45.059
What if I throw a party that is so amazing
that it's actually better than the party

03:45.100 --> 03:48.604
that's supposed to win? When they realise
they could have come to my party

03:48.646 --> 03:50.272
they'll be sad. I won't be sad.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.565
They'll be sad!

03:51.607 --> 03:52.483
Janet?

03:52.524 --> 03:53.400
Hi there!

03:53.692 --> 03:55.110
Janet, when I turned 18

03:55.736 --> 03:57.863
I knelt in front of Princess Grace's
dress mausoleum

03:57.905 --> 04:00.324
and I swore to uphold the Hostess Code.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.868
"I, Tahani Al-Jamil"

04:03.494 --> 04:05.329
"shall do my level best"

04:05.412 --> 04:08.415
"to make every event <i>too much."</i>

04:08.582 --> 04:13.337
Model tonight's decor after my 2008
fundraiser for the Red Cross in Zurich.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.715
No... 2007!

04:22.972 --> 04:23.847
Man...

04:23.973 --> 04:26.016
Michael is not into your class.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.726
Right now, I'm the best student.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.354
I'm gonna be the velociraptor.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.732
You trying to say, "Valedictorian?"
- No.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.442
Look, dude, this isn't your fault.

04:35.484 --> 04:39.029
You've been teaching him ethics
for half an hour and he's been evil since...

04:39.071 --> 04:40.197
the beginning of time.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.074
Oh!

04:42.116 --> 04:45.452
Maybe the reason Michael can't latch onto
the ideas is because he's immortal.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.455
Look, if you live forever, then ethics
don't matter to you

04:48.497 --> 04:51.333
because basically there's no consequences
for your actions.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.835
You tell a lie, who cares?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.670
Wait a few trillion years,
the guilt will fade.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.880
Before I can teach Michael to be good

04:57.172 --> 05:00.009
I have to force him to think about what
we used to think about

05:00.050 --> 05:04.596
that life has an end, and therefore
our actions have meaning.

05:04.722 --> 05:06.140
That's what you used to think about?

05:06.181 --> 05:09.143
I used to think about how
it's weird they don't make pants

05:09.184 --> 05:12.479
that are just one big pant leg
for both your legs.

05:13.022 --> 05:13.897
You mean a skirt?

05:14.732 --> 05:15.691
No! Th...

05:16.483 --> 05:18.861
You're not getting it. And my thing
is different, so shut up.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.112
- Michael.
- Yep.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.156
Is there any way that you can die?

05:22.239 --> 05:23.115
Yeah.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.366
Actually, there is.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.659
It's called, "retirement."

05:25.951 --> 05:28.996
It's rare, but when one of us really screws
something up...

05:29.997 --> 05:31.915
And, uh, what happens exactly?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.376
Well... it's fairly straightforward

05:34.585 --> 05:38.714
my essence would be scooped out of my body
with a flaming ladle

05:38.756 --> 05:42.426
and every molecule in my body would be
placed on the surface

05:42.468 --> 05:43.719
of a different sun.

05:43.969 --> 05:44.845
Sure.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.848
So, is... is that what would
happen if your boss found out

05:47.890 --> 05:49.808
that you defected to our side?
- Yeah.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.061
OK, so that might actually happen.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.898
And if it did, there would be no more
"Michael."

05:56.023 --> 05:57.858
Think about that for a second.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.653
Imagine being retired.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.448
Everyone else is here, but you, poof.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.033
Gone. Nothingness.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.285
Inky black void. Done.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.705
OK, I'll think about that.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.337
Huh.

06:18.962 --> 06:23.300
So, you're saying I would be...

06:27.471 --> 06:28.347
no...

06:29.973 --> 06:30.849
me?

06:42.694 --> 06:43.570
OK!

06:43.904 --> 06:45.239
Now, we're getting somewhere.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.118
Dude, you broke Michael!

06:49.326 --> 06:50.786
No, no, this is good.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.663
He's having an existential crisis!

06:53.038 --> 06:55.749
It's a sort of anguish people go through
when they contemplate

06:55.791 --> 06:58.460
the silent indifference of our
empty universe.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.838
Look, the good news is...

07:00.879 --> 07:02.673
if he can work through this

07:02.714 --> 07:05.676
it's the first step towards understanding
human ethics!

07:05.717 --> 07:06.969
And what if he can't?

07:07.010 --> 07:09.346
Well, then he'll be a lifeless shell
of misery forever

07:09.388 --> 07:10.639
and we're all doomed.

07:10.806 --> 07:14.143
OK, I will be right back.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.978
Gonna go grab some Kamu!

07:17.396 --> 07:18.397
Hey, buddy.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.399
How ya doin'?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.109
Can I get you a snack?

07:22.359 --> 07:24.486
Do you eat? I can never remember.
What do you eat?

07:24.528 --> 07:25.529
Babies?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.489
You want me to get you a big fat baby?

07:27.573 --> 07:28.532
What flavour baby?

07:28.574 --> 07:30.909
How about a Cool Ranch Baby?

07:31.201 --> 07:34.204
Searching for meaning
is philosophical suicide.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.290
How does anyone do anything

07:36.623 --> 07:40.377
when you understand the fleeting nature
of existence?

07:40.669 --> 07:42.254
It's pretty easy, man.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.339
I mean, you learn about death
when you're a kid

07:44.381 --> 07:46.925
and it's just not that big a deal.

07:51.430 --> 07:55.767
Eleanor, baby, I have some sad news.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.771
Your doggie Max has passed away.
Do you know what that means?

08:00.105 --> 08:03.650
Well, sometimes when a dog is very old

08:03.692 --> 08:06.195
like, five or six or something

08:06.487 --> 08:09.072
he crosses a long rainbow bridge

08:09.114 --> 08:12.284
and at the end of that bridge
is a beautiful farm

08:12.326 --> 08:14.786
with lots of grass and trees and...

08:15.454 --> 08:17.623
I dunno, wagons, and a rainbow?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.249
I already said "rainbow"...

08:19.541 --> 08:22.169
The point is, that's where Max is.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.129
Can we visit him at the farm?

08:24.171 --> 08:27.633
Nope, because it's very far away

08:28.008 --> 08:28.884
in...

08:29.051 --> 08:29.927
Guam.

08:30.010 --> 08:30.886
It's in Guam.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.137
Can we have--
- OK, look!

08:32.179 --> 08:33.472
I'm lying, OK?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.724
Ya caught me, congratulations.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.976
The farm is made up, the bridge is made up

08:38.018 --> 08:39.895
there's no such place as "Guam."

08:40.062 --> 08:42.689
Your dog Max is dead in a duffel bag
under the deck.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.691
How did he die?

08:44.733 --> 08:46.777
The short answer is, I don't know.

08:46.818 --> 08:52.324
And the slightly longer answer is,
I didn't know how hot it gets

08:52.366 --> 08:53.700
in cars sometimes.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.245
The point is, don't be sad.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.289
Honestly, I'll get kind of annoyed
if you do get sad

08:59.331 --> 09:02.209
because it's been a very long day,
and that bitch Carol

09:02.251 --> 09:06.255
from work was really on my ass
about some stupid thing

09:06.296 --> 09:07.714
that I don't even know what it was

09:07.756 --> 09:11.134
and at the end of that long day,
I had to use one of my favourite duffel bags

09:11.176 --> 09:14.638
to do something very gross
that I did not like.

09:14.972 --> 09:18.559
Now, let's celebrate that dead dog's life
by bringing Mummy

09:18.600 --> 09:19.935
another bottle of white.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.396
Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay?

09:22.479 --> 09:23.355
Surprise me!

09:23.689 --> 09:25.524
Oh, what am I thinking? Pinot.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.943
Mumma thirsty for that Peen Greej.

09:27.985 --> 09:28.860
Go.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.531
Hey there, buddy.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.116
You feeling kinda empty?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.201
Like there's a gaping chasm in your soul?

09:36.243 --> 09:40.747
A tumbleweed, blowing aimlessly
through a vast desert of nothingness?

09:40.956 --> 09:41.832
Mm-hmm.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.084
You think that nothing we do matters, right?

09:44.126 --> 09:45.627
Yeah.
- Well, here's the thing.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.631
life isn't meaningless
and you are the very proof of that!

09:49.673 --> 09:51.842
I used to feel the way you feel right now

09:51.883 --> 09:54.678
but it turns out everything we did
on Earth mattered.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.724
In fact, actions had an actual point value!

09:58.765 --> 10:01.602
So life had a tangible meaning

10:01.643 --> 10:04.771
which means that you don't have to
feel this way anymore, buddy!

10:05.105 --> 10:06.773
Existential crisis solved.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.526
You're right.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.403
Your lives aren't meaningless.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.448
Everything on Earth counted for something.
- Sure did.

10:16.617 --> 10:21.246
The same is not true here in the afterlife,
where I exist

10:21.580 --> 10:23.081
and have always existed.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.625
OK!

10:24.875 --> 10:28.545
But, there has to be some sort of
value system, right?

10:28.629 --> 10:31.089
I mean, how else do you
judge the value of your actions

10:31.131 --> 10:32.257
outside of work?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.426
There is no "outside of work."

10:35.093 --> 10:37.846
None of us exist outside our jobs.

10:38.305 --> 10:42.184
We have no homes, we have no hobbies,
or relationships.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.478
We get the names of people to torture

10:45.020 --> 10:46.063
we torture them

10:46.355 --> 10:47.689
we get more names.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.524
Ah, OK.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.986
So... you don't actually know
if there's any purpose

10:53.028 --> 10:55.906
or... or larger meaning in all of this?

10:56.615 --> 10:57.699
Nope.
- Cool.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.368
Cool.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.079
I would say I outdid myself, but...

11:02.412 --> 11:06.041
I'm always this good,
so I simply "did" myself.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.836
Everything is perfect.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.713
Red alert. Red alert.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.882
We need help.
- What's wrong with Michael?

11:13.924 --> 11:14.966
Uh-oh. I know that look.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.719
He just snorted a bunch of printer toner.
Mike, listen to me.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.430
You have nothing to worry about.
You still have around 70% of your brain left.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.225
No, no, this is more like a
philosophy overdose.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.727
Basically, Michael just smoked a big bowl
of ennui

11:25.769 --> 11:27.979
and now he's having an existential crisis.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.023
So, we need to cheer him up.

11:30.190 --> 11:34.111
Look at how pretty the restaurant is!

11:34.236 --> 11:37.114
Didn't Tahani do a good job?

11:37.155 --> 11:41.076
Parties are mere distractions
from the relentlessness of entropy.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.536
We're all just corpses

11:43.036 --> 11:44.913
who haven't yet begun to decay.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.581
Yeah, but...

11:47.541 --> 11:48.667
balloons!

11:50.585 --> 11:52.754
OK, we all head over to Vicky's party
together.

11:52.796 --> 11:56.466
We babysit Michael in shifts so that
no one sees he's a catatonic blob.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.093
Or, you could just sit tight

11:58.343 --> 12:01.138
the entire party are going to be
heading over here soon

12:01.346 --> 12:02.973
unless I am sorely mistaken.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.021
<i>♪ I'm taking you, baby ♪</i>

12:10.731 --> 12:12.399
<i>♪ All the way to Lucky Town... ♪</i>

12:13.150 --> 12:14.317
I was sorely mistaken.

12:14.735 --> 12:17.070
OK, bud, whatever's going on right now

12:17.112 --> 12:19.197
just shove your feelings way down deep

12:19.239 --> 12:22.743
plaster on a fake smile and pretend
you're having fun, OK?

12:22.784 --> 12:25.412
Just like I used to do when someone
started talking about their kids.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.623
Hey! Welcome, guys.

12:28.707 --> 12:32.043
Wow, this is... elaborate.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.504
Gunnar was an animal rights activist

12:34.546 --> 12:37.215
so the theme of the party is "Animals!"

12:37.257 --> 12:40.260
Flying station's over there,
if you want to fly like a falcon.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.803
Wahoo!

12:41.887 --> 12:44.806
And over there, we filled a ball pit
with puppies, that's fun.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.393
Oh, and have you ever wanted to sit
in a kangaroo pouch?

12:48.560 --> 12:49.770
My whole dang life.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.439
So, we can all hang out here for a bit
and then we can head over

12:52.481 --> 12:53.857
to your party. Sound good?

12:53.899 --> 12:55.525
Yo, this place is lit!

12:55.567 --> 12:57.319
I'ma go jump in that kangie's pouch!

12:57.360 --> 12:58.695
Hey!

12:59.070 --> 13:02.324
Alright, Tahani, you just need to walk around
the party looking miserable.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.159
Great, just like that. Perfect.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.620
And then, uh, Chidi and I will keep an eye
on Michael.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.872
Where's Michael?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.794
Ah... think I found him.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.170
There they are!

13:15.212 --> 13:16.797
<i>Que pasa, muchachos?</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:19.257
Hey, there bud. You OK?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.343
OK? I'm a new man!

13:21.384 --> 13:23.845
Oh, Eleanor, thank you so much for the advice

13:23.970 --> 13:26.181
about shoving my feelings down deep.

13:26.348 --> 13:30.769
I feel so much better. It's like I'm surfin'
on this wave of positivity!

13:31.144 --> 13:32.229
Is that Janet?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.315
Oh, yeah, have you met my secretary,
Jeanette?

13:35.816 --> 13:39.319
She's a lot like Janet but she doesn't
pretend like she has all the answers.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.987
Oh, uh, hi, Jeanette!

13:41.029 --> 13:43.156
Oh, no. It's still me - Janet.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.534
Michael just asked that I change
my appearance

13:45.575 --> 13:48.411
and also say things like, "You're so funny!"

13:48.745 --> 13:51.540
And, "So, we should go to San Diego
this weekend."

13:51.998 --> 13:54.835
And, "So, how many quarterbacks
are in a home run?"

13:55.502 --> 13:57.212
I don't understand what's happening.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.840
Man, repressing your feelings is great.

13:59.881 --> 14:04.302
I was feeling stress all the time
and now it's just so easy.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.556
Babe, we need to get some food into you,
get you something to eat.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.015
I don't eat anything.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.350
She's perfect.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.018
Hey, turn that around!

14:12.143 --> 14:13.395
<i>♪ Roll them dice, baby! ♪</i>

14:14.646 --> 14:17.357
It did kinda hurt actually, but I love it.

14:17.899 --> 14:21.736
So, he's moved on from existential crisis
to just straight-up mid-life crisis.

14:21.778 --> 14:22.821
That's good, right?

14:22.863 --> 14:24.948
I knew a ton of guys like that
back in Arizona.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.868
I mean, they hit on you when they're drunk
and their breath smells like supplements

14:27.909 --> 14:29.160
but overall, they're pretty harmless.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.121
It's Chinese for "Japan."

14:31.162 --> 14:32.831
Ugh... So cool.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.791
No, no. This is worse.

14:34.833 --> 14:38.211
I mean, an existential crisis is an
acknowledgement that life is absurd

14:38.253 --> 14:40.046
and that absurdity needs to be confronted.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.174
But this is just denial. And at any moment
that denial could collapse

14:43.216 --> 14:44.259
and he'll be a mess!

14:44.301 --> 14:46.094
He is a Jenga tower of sadness!

14:46.344 --> 14:48.847
For an immortal being, he's pretty fragile.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.559
I mean, the guy contemplates his own death
for one forking minute

14:52.601 --> 14:55.186
and completely loses his grip on reality?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.695
You didn't have to come. I said I'm fine.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.823
Yeah, well, I know you guys
weren't super close, but still.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.117
It's hard, losing a parent.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.411
Eleanor! Mummy's here, baby.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.706
Oh, and who is this tall drink of wine?

15:14.998 --> 15:17.417
Um, this is my boyfriend, Sam.

15:17.459 --> 15:18.418
Sam, this is my...

15:18.460 --> 15:19.419
...mother
- Sister!

15:19.461 --> 15:21.004
Sister.
Ugh, that's not gonna work...

15:21.046 --> 15:22.547
It's my ex-husband's funeral.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.758
Thanks for blowing my cover, Doug!

15:25.342 --> 15:27.594
Listen, baby, don't be sad, OK?

15:27.969 --> 15:29.471
Your father wasn't great.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.306
Let's call him what he was

15:31.681 --> 15:33.725
a fart in the shape of a man.

15:33.850 --> 15:34.893
Can you just chill?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.895
I don't want to turn Dad's funeral
into a roast.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.314
I'm not! I'm just saying, he sucked.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.150
I mean, the only photo they could get
of him was a mugshot.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.695
He was a doof, so don't be sad
that he's gone.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.238
I'm not sad. I'm fine.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.156
Good.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.409
You know, I had a long-running bet with
Eleanor's father that I would outlive him.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.244
You wanna guess who won that one?
Come on, guess!

15:53.286 --> 15:54.537
Well, we're at his funeral.
It's pretty clear...

15:54.579 --> 15:56.164
I did! I won, he's dead!

15:56.206 --> 15:57.082
Up top!

15:59.292 --> 16:00.168
Whoa.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.670
Is there a bar?

16:01.711 --> 16:02.587
I'm just gonna...

16:05.215 --> 16:07.008
Did my mum slip you her hotel room key?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.927
Yes, yes, she did.

16:11.429 --> 16:14.015
Thanks so much for coming to
Gunnar's birthday party!

16:14.057 --> 16:18.645
Now, there was a little bit of a mix-up
and Tahani also planned a birthday party

16:18.687 --> 16:22.107
over at the restaurant, so why don't we all
head over there?

16:22.148 --> 16:23.149
Uh, no need.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.151
This party is far superior.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.820
I'm sure yours is amazing.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.239
Well, I did fine on the décor,
but I don't have...

16:29.739 --> 16:32.826
you know...
actual unicorns you can ride.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.080
So, you all just stay here and have fun.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.290
OK, well, if... if that's what you want.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.543
Let's all get back to the party then!

16:41.584 --> 16:43.086
Hang on there, <i>mis amigos!</i>

16:43.128 --> 16:44.379
- No, no, no, no...
- Wooo!

16:44.421 --> 16:45.755
- I wanna make a toast!
- Michael... oh, boy.

16:45.797 --> 16:49.217
OK, I know what you're thinking,
birth is a curse

16:49.259 --> 16:51.469
and existence is a prison

16:51.720 --> 16:53.138
but don't think about that!

16:53.179 --> 16:55.223
Don't be sad, you guys.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.268
Focus on something great, like Drakkar Noir

16:58.309 --> 16:59.227
Woo!

16:59.269 --> 17:03.106
Which I'm wearing a lot of tonight!
Or the Sharper Image catalogue

17:03.398 --> 17:05.650
what can't those guys ionise?

17:05.984 --> 17:08.653
By the way, I am feeling amazing!

17:08.862 --> 17:10.196
I'm gonna do some push-ups.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.199
Then we'll go around the room
and name our favourite cheese!

17:13.241 --> 17:15.994
OK, that's good with the speeches.
That's good, yeah...

17:16.036 --> 17:17.787
Let's all get back to the party.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.039
What was that?

17:19.080 --> 17:21.666
You didn't run any of that by me.
- Oh, I know, I know

17:21.708 --> 17:23.126
I'm sorry, babe. Listen...

17:23.168 --> 17:25.712
when you guys first took over, I was upset.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.589
But it's all good, now.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.424
I mean, anger is toxic

17:29.674 --> 17:31.342
I'm not about that negativity.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.970
<i>Mi</i> torture <i>es su</i> torture.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.139
I am so happy you're in charge.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.557
OK. Well...

17:37.891 --> 17:38.767
good!

17:39.184 --> 17:40.727
<i>Namaste, chica.</i>

17:42.103 --> 17:43.563
Do you wanna dance?
- No.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.481
OK.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.275
I'm leaving.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.694
I'm too miserable to stay here
for one more second.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.572
Why? There are baby monkeys
and dolphins to ride

17:52.614 --> 17:54.324
and a game of "Hungry, Hungry, Hippos"

17:54.365 --> 17:55.825
with actual hippos.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.495
This party is way better than ours.

17:58.661 --> 18:02.332
Why are you miserabl... oh.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.666
You stay and have fun.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.960
I'm going to go throw myself a pity party

18:06.377 --> 18:08.838
though I doubt I can even
throw one of those properly.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.136
God, I love this stuff.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.097
Ah!

18:17.138 --> 18:18.473
Let's keep this party going!

18:18.681 --> 18:20.475
What now, huh? You wanna hit the clubs?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.143
Oh, oh, oh, Vegas.

18:22.352 --> 18:25.146
No, no, even better, Dubai.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.607
Jeanette, make us a Dubai.

18:27.649 --> 18:30.276
Kinda feel like maybe

18:30.318 --> 18:32.320
we should wind down, huh, bud?

18:32.362 --> 18:34.656
No, no, can't do that... can't stop moving,
can't stop moving.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.783
If I stop moving, I'll start thinking.
And if I start thinking

18:36.825 --> 18:39.911
I'll start thinking about things
I don't want to think about, like death.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.038
Whoops...

18:42.372 --> 18:43.748
I'm thinking about it now.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.667
Yep. Thinking about death again.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.793
Oh! I know!

18:46.835 --> 18:49.170
Jeanette and I have been taking, uh,
samba lessons, huh?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.922
Let us show you how to do it. Come on.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.967
I think Vicky bought his excuse but we need
to snap him out of this.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.303
Which one of these confusing French books
will make him normal again?

18:57.512 --> 18:58.763
It's not that easy.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.808
I mean, emotionally, he's all over the map
right now.

19:01.850 --> 19:05.770
And I can't believe I'm saying this but
I don't think this can be solved with a book.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.606
What's the big whoop? I dealt
with death and I was fine.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.401
Were you? I mean... you never had
one moment where you were freaked out

19:11.484 --> 19:13.778
by the permanence of death?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.488
Never one moment like that?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.408
Hey, man, you got toothbrush holders?

19:18.616 --> 19:19.909
Uh, sure. Yeah.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.578
Right over here.
- What's this?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.204
Who has four toothbrushes?

19:23.246 --> 19:25.123
Like, Bill Gates or something?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.833
No, that's, like, for a family.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.128
Family?

19:30.461 --> 19:33.506
Like a whole family and
their toothbrushes all together?

19:34.132 --> 19:36.050
Two slots for the parent toothbrushes

19:36.092 --> 19:39.053
and two slots for their... kids?

19:40.013 --> 19:40.889
Yep.

19:41.097 --> 19:45.143
So, the parent toothbrushes can be close
to the kid toothbrushes and...

19:46.644 --> 19:47.937
watch over them, and...

19:49.731 --> 19:53.401
they can all talk about
their toothbrush feelings

19:54.319 --> 19:56.863
and they can hold
their little toothbrush hands

19:56.905 --> 19:57.947
when they're sad.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.324
And...

19:59.449 --> 20:02.076
make sure no harm ever comes
to their little bristles?

20:04.078 --> 20:05.955
Sure.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.838
Uh, you need a Kleenex?

20:13.922 --> 20:14.797
Thank you.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.549
Sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.927
A family pack?

20:29.354 --> 20:32.941
I don't know if what I'm gonna say
is gonna hurt or help, but screw it.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.692
Do you know what's really
happening right now?

20:35.318 --> 20:37.612
You're learning what it's like to be human.

20:37.946 --> 20:42.575
All humans are aware of death,
so we're all a little bit sad

20:43.243 --> 20:44.285
all the time.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.787
That's just the deal.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.123
Sounds like a crappy deal.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.210
Well, yeah, it is.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.671
But we don't get offered any other ones.

20:55.088 --> 20:59.300
And if you try and ignore your sadness,
it just ends up leaking out of you anyway.

20:59.842 --> 21:00.760
I've been there.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.387
And everybody's been there.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.429
So, don't fight it.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.350
And in the words of a very wise
"Bed, Bath and Beyond" employee

21:07.392 --> 21:08.518
I once knew...

21:08.935 --> 21:10.645
"Go ahead and cry all you want."

21:11.271 --> 21:14.107
"But you're gonna have to pay
for that toilet plunger."

21:19.112 --> 21:20.321
Got you something to eat.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.739
I'm not hungry.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.451
I just want to sit and stare at nothing

21:26.035 --> 21:28.162
and silently scream for the rest of time.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.291
I might be way off base here

21:32.000 --> 21:33.668
but you seem kinda bummed.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.045
I really thought I could throw a better party

21:36.087 --> 21:38.965
than a magical, all-powerful being.

21:39.007 --> 21:42.844
And moreover, what's this say about me?
About the life I lived?

21:42.969 --> 21:46.556
The way they're torturing me is through
event-planning mishaps.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.016
And it works!

21:48.766 --> 21:50.435
Am I really that shallow?

21:51.644 --> 21:52.520
Listen.

21:53.146 --> 21:57.233
Back in Jacksonville, I was in charge
of a 60-person dance crew.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.402
Whenever we
auditioned a new dancer

21:59.736 --> 22:02.030
we would rate them in five categories

22:02.363 --> 22:03.406
dancing ability

22:03.573 --> 22:04.532
coolness

22:04.741 --> 22:05.616
dopeness

22:05.783 --> 22:06.784
freshness

22:06.868 --> 22:08.286
and smart-brained.

22:08.453 --> 22:11.497
I would give you an eight in every category.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.249
Well, eight isn't bad, I suppose.

22:13.374 --> 22:14.959
Oh, no. Eight is the best.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.961
It was a scale of one to 13

22:17.003 --> 22:18.880
but eight was highest.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.673
The scale went up and then back down

22:20.715 --> 22:21.591
like a tent.

22:21.841 --> 22:22.717
Why?

22:23.051 --> 22:24.052
It's not important.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.387
Lately, you've been really down on yourself

22:26.596 --> 22:29.223
but you're the most
amazing person I've ever met

22:29.891 --> 22:31.142
uh, besides Michael.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.977
And he was constantly torturing us

22:33.019 --> 22:34.270
so I'd only rank him a ten.

22:34.437 --> 22:35.772
Which is worse than an eight?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.816
That's so unnecessarily confusing.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.151
The point is

22:40.610 --> 22:44.697
you're cool, dope, fresh, and smart-brained.

22:45.073 --> 22:48.326
Never seen you dance, but I bet you're good

22:48.868 --> 22:50.578
because you're good at everything.

22:51.579 --> 22:52.580
You're awesome.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.083
Be nicer to yourself!

22:55.666 --> 22:56.918
Thank you, Jason.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.798
From one eight to another.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.136
"Excellent progress this week."

23:07.178 --> 23:09.555
"Tahani, devastated by party mishap."

23:09.680 --> 23:13.976
"Eleanor continues to be a selfish monster,
creating burden for Chidi."

23:14.227 --> 23:15.561
"Selfish monster?"

23:15.603 --> 23:18.856
I brought you back from the brink
of an existential coma, dude!

23:18.898 --> 23:21.150
Selfish monster...
- No, no, I have to embellish your misery

23:21.192 --> 23:24.946
on these fake torture reports so that
my boss doesn't get suspicious.

23:24.987 --> 23:29.117
But really, I am grateful
you pulled me out of my funk.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.912
I mean, is that how you all felt on Earth?

23:32.954 --> 23:34.539
Because that was just awful.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.832
Oh, yeah, it was no fun.

23:35.873 --> 23:39.335
But you had it worse,
because you're an immortal being.

23:39.502 --> 23:42.255
Humans learn that they're going to die
when they're six.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.215
- Mm.
- How old are you?

23:44.382 --> 23:45.800
Hard to explain, really.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.220
On my birth certificate it just says,
"always".

23:49.804 --> 23:50.847
Hm. Well...

23:51.180 --> 23:54.642
now that you've become acquainted with
Existential Crises

23:54.684 --> 23:58.855
I thought we could read "Death,"
by philosopher Todd May.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.648
Sounds like the perfect beach read.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.692
Should we wait for Tahani and Jason?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.277
Where are those goofballs?

24:05.820 --> 24:09.907
So, um, we should probably discuss...

24:09.949 --> 24:12.743
That was awesome!

24:12.910 --> 24:14.203
It was...

24:14.996 --> 24:16.205
surprisingly so.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.374
But we should still discuss--

24:18.416 --> 24:20.460
You want some breakfast?
I know how to make cereal.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.961
Sure, but Jason--

24:22.003 --> 24:23.045
OK, be right back!
