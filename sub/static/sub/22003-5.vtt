test for badminton?

explain how teaching works,

-Many.
-Teaching has changed.

You can't just watch a kid play
badminton, now and give them a
mark.

That's what I would do.
Now ya gotta give them a test.

00:18.834 --> 00:22.291
They gotta know the dimensions
of the court, the rules, the
weight of the shuttle cock.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.208
-A kid can suck at badminton and
still ace badminton.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.208
-Like right now, the kid with
the top mark in my badminton
unit...

00:28.250 --> 00:30.375
Cannot hit the shuttle cock
over the net.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.875
-Please stop saying shuttle
cock. It's called a birdie.

00:32.917 --> 00:35.291
-Well, ah, question four.

00:35.333 --> 00:39.250
-The proper name for a
badminton birdie is...

00:39.291 --> 00:42.041
A. Flying cock...
-Close, 'cause it...

00:42.083 --> 00:44.959
-Not that close.
B. Air cock...

00:45.000 --> 00:46.917
-Also close.
-Still not close.

00:46.959 --> 00:50.709
C. Shuttle cock...Or
D. Subtle cock.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.875
-See what I did with C and D?
-Yeah...

00:52.917 --> 00:55.667
-I made them close, for the
kids that like to guess.

00:55.709 --> 00:58.834
Because a lot of kids will have
heard me say this word.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.542
But they weren't listening.
Shuttle cock, C.

01:01.583 --> 01:05.333
In fact, this test, I made every
answer C.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.500
-You made fifty answers C?
-Yeah.

01:07.542 --> 01:10.291
-Wouldn't they catch on,
though, by the next test?

01:10.333 --> 01:12.959

the next test all C's.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.792
D's, all D's. And they'll go...
-[Quietly]: Here we go.

No way he'd do it again!

Next test all...

01:22.917 --> 01:24.959
-A's.
-Right. Shhh.

system.

I thought he was onto it.

-Right.

It's probably easier to mark
too.

And the marks don't even count.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.750
We just have to enter it all to
cover our asses when we
give them the real marks.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.667
[Gerry]: It's stupid.
-I wanna be clear...

09:31.709 --> 09:34.500
That I don't really understand
what you're saying, but I also,
I don't care.

09:34.542 --> 09:37.041
-I should be on the court,
connecting with the kids,
teaching them.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.333
Showing them, by example,
how to be a great athlete.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.375
Instead I have to do this BS and
I don't get paid anything extra.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.333
-Yeah, that sucks.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.917
I just get my bar-back to do all
the little stuff I don't care
about.

09:46.959 --> 09:49.375
Hey Steve! Can you just listen
to Gerry for a minute?

09:49.417 --> 09:53.917
-Okay, well, for your
information, Steve, I don't
have a bar-back that can do...

09:53.959 --> 09:56.792
-Think about it...
-Wait a second...

09:56.834 --> 10:00.000
-You're gonna get it...
-I have a whole class full
of bar-backs.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.792
I have twenty five helpers,
called students.
-Haha.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.709
There it is.
-Ah! Steve-O!
[They slap hands]

10:08.250 --> 10:10.208
-I'll get it.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.375
-Okay. Hey, thanks again
for holding down the fort.

10:14.417 --> 10:18.125
-Of course. As I said, I'm
always happy to help.
Even if it means you...

10:18.166 --> 10:20.208
Sleep the whole night long,
through every feeding.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.458
-Oh, did you not have a
good night sleep?

10:22.500 --> 10:25.917
-Oh, you probably couldn't hear
from upstairs with the door shut
at the other end of the house.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.709
-Yeah, Craig didn't sleep much
last night. Neither of us did.
-Oh.

10:28.750 --> 10:31.083
That is weird, huh?
Craig, did you not...

10:31.125 --> 10:33.500
Did you not have a good
nightypoo, hey buddy?

10:33.542 --> 10:35.667
-No, he did not.

10:35.709 --> 10:38.041
-Well, you are up
for a fun day...

10:38.083 --> 10:41.333
With your dad today.
Mommy's super jealous!

10:41.375 --> 10:44.959
-What? I thought that...
-Are we good here or what?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.709
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

10:47.750 --> 10:49.834
-Umm, we're fine.
-Great!

10:49.875 --> 10:52.750
-Just maybe we could switch up
at like middle of the day?
Just for feedings or something?

10:52.792 --> 10:55.875
-We don't need to, 'cause
I prepped a bunch of bottles
for you, so...

10:55.917 --> 10:57.792
-Ahh.
-Have a great day boys.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.959
-Oh great. Hey.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.125
-[Craig squawks]
-Oh! Oh, oh, oh.

11:02.166 --> 11:05.125
-Oh?
-[Laughs]: I almost forgot.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.834
Where would you be without
the bottles? Yeah.
-Oh right.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.792
Thank you so much.
-Bye buddy.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.875
-If we need anything...
-Don't call. Just figure it out.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.709
-Yup.
-Cool.

11:16.083 --> 11:19.750
-[Craig cries a bit]
-Isn't she great?
That's how I feel.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.000
-Okay, everybody.

11:23.417 --> 11:27.458
Brandon, where's your Phys Ed
uniform?
-Ah, I forgot it.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.291
-Perfect, I need ya to do
something for me.
Come on over here.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.959
-Oh, ah...Actually I was going
to work on my history
assignment.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.417
-This is Phys Ed class, you
don't forget your uniform,
probably on purpose,

11:36.458 --> 11:39.166
so you can work on another
subject. I'm not stupid.

11:39.208 --> 11:41.625
Get over here.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.125
I have a...

11:45.166 --> 11:47.291
Phys Ed assignment for you.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.625
This is a Formative Assessment
sheet.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.834
I need you to fill that out for
me, while the class is on.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.583
-Um, what's...What's
the point of this?

11:55.625 --> 11:58.792
-There is no point. That's why
I'm getting you to do it.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.875
See how that works?
Watch the kids play.

12:00.917 --> 12:03.875
Look at everybody.
Find their name.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.917
Put a letter under the column.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.917
Add a comment, I don't care.
Just fill it out. Just make
sure it's filled out.

12:08.959 --> 12:11.875
-I guess.
-Good, have a seat.

12:11.917 --> 12:14.959
Okay everybody. Game on.
Let's go!

12:15.000 --> 12:18.083
-I hear Mrs. Robertson gives
three hours of homework a night.

12:18.125 --> 12:20.291
-[Whispers]: Noooo.
-It's too much.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.959
-That is too much! Okay,
so workload grievances.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.875
I'm gonna go right, straight to
administration about that one.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.834
Okay, what else ya got for me?

12:28.875 --> 12:31.792
-My kids say the guidance
counselor is kind of a
pervy creep.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.917
-Oh, you're kids are so
perceptive. He's disgusting!

12:35.959 --> 12:38.792
How great is this? We have
a direct line to the president.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.750
-Oh, this is great for me too.
[Laughs]

12:41.792 --> 12:46.041
We should do this more often.
-We actually do this every day!
You should join us!

12:46.083 --> 12:48.667
-Oh, that sounds like so much
fun! I would love to.

12:48.709 --> 12:50.959
-Well, cheers to that!
-Okay!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.792
Yeah, cheers to that.
Um...But...

12:53.834 --> 12:56.625
What about Principal Cheeley?
Any complaints there?

12:56.667 --> 12:58.542
-He can be a bit much!
-Yeah.

12:58.583 --> 13:02.834
-But apparently, he's a huge
step up from that awful
Principal Mason.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.125
-I don't...I think that's a
little harsh!

13:05.166 --> 13:07.959
-I heard she married the
worst teacher in the school.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.208
-Twice! And I heard she
threw a fun fair that

13:11.250 --> 13:15.792
ended with a burning cross and
klansmen dancing on stage.

13:15.834 --> 13:19.291
-Have you met her Lisa?
-[Laughs uncomfortably]

13:19.333 --> 13:23.208
Once...Twice maybe in...
Passing.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.375
-Sounds like you dodged a
bullet there.

13:25.417 --> 13:27.709
-Well, cheers to that ladies.

13:28.792 --> 13:31.166
-[Whispers]: Cheers to that.
Okay.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.250
-Pick nice!
-Ah, sorry, sir...

13:35.291 --> 13:37.417
-What...Ah! See what you did?
What do you want?

13:37.458 --> 13:39.583
-Oh, don't get so rattled.
-Whaddya want?

13:39.625 --> 13:41.750
-Oh, sorry, yeah. Could you
explain the difference between

13:41.792 --> 13:43.959
Developing and Proficient
just one more time?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.250
Proficient's better than
Developing, okay? Thank you,
see ya!

13:46.291 --> 13:48.417
-Okay, sure, sure.
Oh, another question.
-What?!

13:48.458 --> 13:50.792
-Amy's form is terrible but she
keeps making all of her shots.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.959
So, I was just wondering which
one that would be.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.750
Proficient, Not Proficient!
I don't care! I just need
you to fill that out.

13:55.792 --> 13:58.291
-[Brandon]: Okay.
-Put letters, put grades,
put comments. Who cares?

13:58.333 --> 14:01.750
-Sure, sure. Oh, another
question.
-Oh my gosh, timeout!

14:01.792 --> 14:03.959
-Sorry, sorry.
-Look, this isn't rocket
science.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.709
-No, it's not.
-It's a chart. There's names,
columns, letters.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.959
I don't care what you put in
there! I just need you to fill
it out, with anything.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.917
-It's just, all this analytical
stuff, it stresses me...

14:12.959 --> 14:16.291
I don't want to ruin, I don't
want to mess this up for you.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.500
-Okay, alright. Okay, relax.
Okay.

14:18.542 --> 14:20.667
-I'm panicking a little bit.
-Okay.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.125
I don't want you to have a
panic attack, okay? Just...

14:23.166 --> 14:26.333
[Takes a deep breath]
-[Brandon breathes]

14:26.375 --> 14:29.208
-What's your favourite subject?
-My favourite subject, ah, art.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.625
-I have an idea, come on over
here. One sec.

14:31.667 --> 14:35.041
Okay, look, look. Hey,
how about we do this.
How about we do this.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.208
From an artistic point of view.
-Oh sure.

14:37.250 --> 14:40.291
-Let's say the sheet is
your easel, right?

14:40.333 --> 14:44.417
The letters your paints and the
columns there, that's your
canvas.

14:44.458 --> 14:47.959
And the desk...
That's you're art studio.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.875
-Wow.
-Now, express yourself.

14:49.917 --> 14:52.917
-That, that really helps. And,
that was beautiful. Beautiful.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.625
-Was it? I just made it up.
I can't stand art, I think
it's a waste of a subject.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.792
-Well...
-It's stupid, I can't
believe kids take it.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.959
-Well, that's, that's
not right but...Okay.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.375
-Yeah. But anyway, if it helps
me get through this...

15:03.417 --> 15:05.625
-Sure. Okay. Thanks.
-Paint away.

15:05.667 --> 15:09.041
-Okay, get to work, alright.
Thank you!

Yes you are and if that

15:26.709 --> 15:29.875
You're nice and quiet. You don't
get that from your mom.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.208
-[Gerry knocks]: You wanted to
see me?

15:34.959 --> 15:38.500
-[Craig coos]

15:38.542 --> 15:40.709
-[Robert]: Gerry?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.583
-Hey.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.417
-I've been wanting to talk
to you about your Formative
Assessments.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.583
-[Whispers]: Dammit Brandon,
you idiot.

15:49.625 --> 15:52.750
-[Quietly]: Gerry...
They're spectacular!

15:54.834 --> 15:56.583
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.834
-Well, ah, you're welcome.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.208
You asked and I, did it.
Easy.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.709
-Thank you, Gerry.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.667
I called Lucy's mom.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.959
And I had all the information I
needed to justify her mark.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.583
It's so detailed, I felt like I
was in the gym watching
her development.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.750
-It's the reason we do those
Formative Assessments, right?

16:14.792 --> 16:18.458
So we can justify why they got
the grade they got, so...

16:18.500 --> 16:20.959
I mean this stuff is great.
These comments that you added...

16:21.041 --> 16:25.250
Like: "Jason Flicks his wrist
with the grace of a swan
taking first flight.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.875
Result? Swish."

16:27.917 --> 16:29.792
I mean, that's, poetry.

16:29.834 --> 16:32.041
I guess I was in a...

16:32.083 --> 16:34.458
Poetic sort of mind.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.834
-Now I guess I just need the
rest of your classes in.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.166
Just like this.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.959
-You said I had to do this
class. You didn't mention...

16:43.000 --> 16:45.083
-No, you start with this class
and then you do the rest
of them.

16:45.125 --> 16:48.375
-We have to do this every day
for every class? For the
whole year?

16:48.417 --> 16:50.625
-Yeah.
-[Gerry]: That's a lot of work.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.417
-Yeah. I didn't know
ya had it in ya.

16:53.458 --> 16:56.041
-I did too good.
-[Craig squawks]

16:56.083 --> 16:58.375
-Oh, you should probably...
[Mouths]: Go.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.959
-Oh my God.
Bullshit.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.250
[Gerry loudly]: Great!
-[Craig cries]

17:03.291 --> 17:06.500
-Hi ladies. I am so
sorry I'm late.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.500
What are we talking about?

17:08.542 --> 17:12.500
-Only about how annoying it
is that Pokémon cards got
banned at the school.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.458
-Oh.
-My little Troy loves them.

17:15.959 --> 17:19.083
-And guess what piece of
human garbage apparently
decided to ban them.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.250
-Principal Mason.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.792
-Ding, ding, ding.
What a stick in the mud.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.250
-Sounds like she was the worst.
-I'm sure she didn't make
that decision hastily.

17:27.291 --> 17:31.375
I mean, I'm sure she actually
put a lot of work into studying
their impact on student success.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.542
And determined that they were,
in fact...

17:33.583 --> 17:36.333
Distracting enough to lower
student averages by...

17:36.375 --> 17:38.792
I don't, I don't know, like, 7%!

17:40.083 --> 17:42.583
-Someone sounds like a
fan of Principal Mason.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.333
-I was just speculating.
[Laughs]

17:46.375 --> 17:49.875
But I can tell you what's
not speculation...

17:52.250 --> 17:54.959
She practices kissing
on her cats.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.333
-No! [Gasps]
-Yeah.

17:57.375 --> 18:00.250
-What a loser!
-Real lonely.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.250
-[Knocks]: Mr. Hunt, can I steal
Brandon for a minute please?

18:04.291 --> 18:07.792
-Oh, we're just reviewing
everything for next week's
test, so it's kind of important.

18:07.834 --> 18:10.709
-And this is very important.
-Well, very trumps kinda.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.959
Okay, get outta here Brandon.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.667
-Alright, this next thing will
definitely be on the test
so pay attention.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.917
-Ah, should I listen to that?
-No, let's go.

18:18.959 --> 18:21.166
-Only gonna say this once.
Alright...
-[Gerry]: Let's go.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.291
-[Brandon]: What's up, sir?

18:23.333 --> 18:26.166
-Oh, I need you to do some
Formative Assessment stuff
for my Grade 10 Phys Ed class.

18:26.208 --> 18:29.083
-Um, I'm in a class right now.
-Yeah, it'll just take like
twenty minutes.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.000
And you can head right
back to class.

18:31.041 --> 18:33.458
-I thought I was just
doing it for my class.
-So did I.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.667
But you were so good with
your fancy little comments,

18:35.709 --> 18:38.125
I need you to do all my classes
now.
-You said paint a canvas.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.041
-Yeah, I didn't say paint a
Picasso.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.291
Because you did such a great
job, I made you my official...

18:44.875 --> 18:46.834
-Excuse me?
-You're my F.A.G.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.917
You're my Formative Assessment
Guy. I made you a little sign
and everything.

18:49.959 --> 18:52.500
-Um, I can't miss class
every day.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.667
-You won't be long.
You'll come in quickly.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.792
And as you get better,
you'll shave off minutes.

18:56.834 --> 19:00.250
Plus you hate Phys. Ed, so I'm
gonna give you some bonus
marks for being my F.A.G.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.667
-Is it possible you could
call me something else?

19:02.709 --> 19:05.125
-No, but I can't fit Formative
Assessment Guy on the sign.

19:05.166 --> 19:09.000
You're my F.A.G! You're
Mr. F.A.G. in the school now.
-Really?

19:09.041 --> 19:10.959
-I think so! Okay?
-Sure.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.959
-So, own it! Get to work!
-[Brandon]: Can't wait! Alright.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.500
-Everybody, let's go!

19:16.542 --> 19:18.917
-Bobbi! Bobbi!
-What! What's up?

19:18.959 --> 19:22.208
-Please take Craig for a second.
-Fine, no problem.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.875
But, I thought you wanted to
pull your weight as a father.

19:24.917 --> 19:28.083
I'm sorry that spending time
with your son is such a burden
for you.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.417
-It's not a burden. It's just
that I've had him all day.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.709
It's like having another limb.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.959
I haven't had a chance to brush
my teeth, I have work to do, my
nipple's cracked, my feet hurt.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.417
-Oh fine! I'm sorry he's such
an inconvenience. Yeah.

19:38.458 --> 19:41.166
-Ooooh.
-Oh my...It's a bottle.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.458
-Ooooh.
-[Craig starts to cry]

19:43.500 --> 19:45.792
-[Bobbi]: Yeah.
-[Craig cries]

19:45.834 --> 19:48.667
-Wow, I should have never
doubted you Bobbi.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.917
-[Bobbi]: Aww.
-You grow more fresh
faced by the day.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.875
-Aw, thank you.
-[Malik]: How does she do it?

19:52.917 --> 19:55.333
Could we have round of applause
for supermom over here?

19:55.375 --> 19:57.542
-[All clap]
-Oh, come on!

19:57.583 --> 19:59.917
-Oh, thanks everybody...
I mean, I'm just doing my best.

19:59.959 --> 20:03.250
I'm doing what anybody else
would do, just maybe a
bit better.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.917
[Bobbi laughs]
Yeah, high five!

20:05.959 --> 20:08.417
Still nothing.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.834
-Deadbeat.
-Have you no shame?

20:11.875 --> 20:14.625
-What's that Craig?
Yeah, I want to go too.
