WEBVTT

00:06.760 --> 00:08.560
"Yea, thou I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

00:08.640 --> 00:10.160
I will fear no evil; for thou art with me;

00:10.280 --> 00:12.880
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

00:36.360 --> 00:40.240
Doron, the team is ready
for the briefing.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.520
[ARABIC]
[Stop it!]

01:34.600 --> 01:36.040
[I didn't do anything.]

01:36.120 --> 01:39.400
[-Stop looking at me like that.]
[-Like what?]

01:39.480 --> 01:42.000
[Quit looking at me,
it's making me nervous.]

01:42.080 --> 01:44.720
[There are no explosives on it yet,
why are you scared?]

01:47.160 --> 01:49.960
[Now you're an engineer?
Yahya Ayyash 2?]

01:50.040 --> 01:54.760
[You don't need to be Yahya Ayyash
to know the vest isn't loaded yet.]

01:57.600 --> 02:01.840
[I left an empty pocket for the <i>elemen</i>t,
as Abu Ahmad requested.]

02:01.920 --> 02:05.080
[This <i>element </i>will lead to
an all-out war in the Middle East.]

02:05.320 --> 02:06.760
[God willing.]

02:09.720 --> 02:12.840
While they are preparing Doron,
we keep our distance.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.360
Once Abu Ahmad arrives,

02:15.440 --> 02:18.480
we storm in and snatch him,
dead or alive.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.440
How do we keep track of Doron?

02:20.520 --> 02:24.720
Using every means of technology
we have, and this.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.800
You plan to use
cigarette smoke to find him?

02:30.320 --> 02:32.640
This packet has GPS
and a bugging device.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.960
As long as Doron carries it,
we can track him.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.280
How do we know Abu Ahmad
will meet with Doron?

02:38.360 --> 02:41.200
Abu Ahmad meets all his
suicide bombers personally.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.560
He's the final stop
before the vest goes on.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.080
We storm in when Doron
is already wearing the vest?!

02:47.160 --> 02:48.880
-Yes.
-No way!

02:48.960 --> 02:49.760
That's insane.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.840
Well, we can't plan
every detail up front.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.120
I trust you guys completely.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.760
Have you got
your jockstrap on?

02:59.840 --> 03:02.800
Okay, guys, in 10 minutes
we hit the road.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.440
Doron, don't worry.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.720
We've got your back.

03:28.200 --> 03:35.200
BEITUNIA
SOUTH OF RAMALLAH

04:28.160 --> 04:29.840
[Peace be upon you.]

04:46.320 --> 04:49.200
[Feel free
to smoke in the car, my friend.]

04:52.160 --> 04:56.120
[I quit about a year ago.]

04:56.280 --> 04:57.880
[You know why?]

04:57.960 --> 05:01.720
[Not for my health,
but because it's pricy.]

05:01.800 --> 05:04.760
[I used to smoke
a packet a day.]

05:05.240 --> 05:07.240
[You know how much
that cost me?]

05:07.320 --> 05:11.880
[Each month I'd spend an entire
week's salary on smokes.]

05:13.680 --> 05:16.200
[Not to mention that once I quit,]

05:16.280 --> 05:19.720
[I got back my senses
of smell and taste.]

05:20.000 --> 05:22.880
[Tomatoes were suddenly tastier.]

05:27.960 --> 05:30.840
Hey, relax, it's alright.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.200
If he can stand this guy,
he can take anything.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.720
I'd blow myself up
with that driver by now.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.160
[Today I'm already over it.]

05:38.480 --> 05:42.360
[You can smoke right before me,
it doesn't bother me. It really doesn't.]

05:53.880 --> 05:55.680
[-Is this it?]
[-Yes, my friend.]

05:55.760 --> 05:57.760
[Those were their directions.]

06:07.400 --> 06:08.600
[-Thanks, pal.]
[-Gladly.]

06:08.680 --> 06:11.000
[Should I stay
here while you wait for them?]

06:11.080 --> 06:12.840
[No, thanks, I'm fine.]

06:13.080 --> 06:14.680
Pull over.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.400
[Could I have a cigarette?]

06:17.480 --> 06:19.720
[-Sure, my friend.]
[-Thanks, buddy.]

06:30.960 --> 06:33.240
Samah is entering the building.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.160
Nabil, you guys are parked too far.
Move closer.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.160
-Any closer, and we'll be exposed.
-It's your call.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.480
-I think you're too far.
-It's okay, trust me.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.720
Make sure the drone doesn't descend,
not even for a second.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.360
According to my monitor,
he just walked in.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.240
[Samah, come in.]

07:47.640 --> 07:50.320
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

07:53.440 --> 07:56.240
[Don't worry, God is with you.]

07:56.320 --> 07:57.840
[Thanks for coming.]

07:57.920 --> 07:59.440
[Do you feel ready?]

07:59.520 --> 08:01.080
[Of course.]

08:02.720 --> 08:04.840
[This is Khaled, a heck of a guy,
he's one of ours.]

08:04.920 --> 08:08.360
[We call him <i>The Jew </i>because
everyone thinks he's a Jew.]

08:08.440 --> 08:12.280
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace and God's mercy.]

08:12.440 --> 08:14.880
[This is our engineer Samir.]

08:16.280 --> 08:19.200
[Listen, there are some things
to do before you go.]

08:19.280 --> 08:21.480
[Khaled will go over them
with you.]

08:27.600 --> 08:30.720
[-You will be wearing this vest.]
[-Careful!]

08:32.280 --> 08:35.400
[Sorry. Samir is very
precautious about his work.]

08:35.480 --> 08:38.760
[It will be put on you
very very slowly.]

08:40.800 --> 08:43.640
[Samir will walk you through
the other details.]

08:43.720 --> 08:49.360
[You must be extra careful when
you're putting this on, got it?]

08:58.720 --> 09:00.640
[-Hello?]
[-Hello, my love.]

09:00.720 --> 09:03.000
[How are you, my darling?]

09:05.160 --> 09:08.880
[-Why are you calling?
[-I miss you. Don't you miss me?]

09:08.960 --> 09:10.640
[Yes.]

09:11.800 --> 09:13.800
[What's wrong, my love?]

09:13.880 --> 09:15.560
[Nothing.]

09:16.440 --> 09:19.480
[-What are you doing?]
[-Nothing.]

09:22.000 --> 09:25.520
[-Okay, I'll be there soon.]
[-No, Walid, there's no reason for that.]

09:25.600 --> 09:27.360
[Do I need a reason
to come see my future wife?]

09:27.440 --> 09:30.080
[-No, but--]
[-No buts. I'm coming over.]

09:30.160 --> 09:32.840
[-Bye bye.]
[-No, Wali--]

09:43.000 --> 09:45.040
<i>[In the name of Allah</i>
<i>the Beneficent, the Merciful]</i>

10:24.520 --> 10:27.320
[Have you been doing this
for many years?]

10:27.480 --> 10:30.840
[One day I will have the courage
to be a Shahid myself.]

10:33.000 --> 10:36.280
[Are volunteers usually
as quiet as I am?]

10:37.160 --> 10:40.280
[You're the most talkative one
I've met so far.]

10:43.240 --> 10:44.520
[What now?]

10:45.760 --> 10:48.280
[Time to pray. This way.]

10:57.880 --> 10:59.640
[Allahu akbar.]

11:02.200 --> 11:04.040
[Allahu akbar.]

11:05.680 --> 11:07.440
[Allahu akbar.]

11:10.880 --> 11:12.760
[Allahu akbar.]

11:14.840 --> 11:17.280
[God listens to his followers.]

11:21.880 --> 11:23.720
[Allahu akbar.]

11:27.080 --> 11:29.040
[Allahu akbar.]

11:31.520 --> 11:35.440
[May God's mercy and peace
be upon you.]

11:41.960 --> 11:43.720
[Is it ready?]

11:49.400 --> 11:51.280
[-Hello.]
[-Hello.]

11:51.360 --> 11:54.360
[I have to take every item
you've got on you.]

12:00.680 --> 12:02.560
[Including the cigarettes.]

12:02.680 --> 12:03.960
[What?]

12:04.040 --> 12:06.200
[Hand over the cigarettes.]

12:06.600 --> 12:08.560
[I need them.]

12:09.520 --> 12:12.400
[Your faith will
keep you strong.]

12:12.480 --> 12:15.000
[You must be completely pure.]

12:18.560 --> 12:20.600
[I'll get rid of them
on the way there.]

12:26.400 --> 12:28.960
[Our religion forbids smoking.
It's a sin.]

12:29.040 --> 12:31.120
[You're going on a mission
in Allah's name.]

12:31.200 --> 12:34.320
[I won't let the cigarettes
stir you from that.]

12:34.400 --> 12:36.560
[Please, give me the packet.]

12:47.360 --> 12:51.080
[Samir will take you through
the practical side of the mission.]

12:51.200 --> 12:54.080
[Go ahead, Samir.
We're ready.]

12:57.000 --> 12:59.760
[The explosives
are in these pockets.]

12:59.840 --> 13:03.520
[You press this button
to detonate it...]

13:03.600 --> 13:06.080
[-Are you listening?]
[-Yes, I am.]

13:06.160 --> 13:07.720
[-Are you sure?]
[-Yes.]

13:07.800 --> 13:09.440
[-Did you see where the button is?]
[-There.]

13:09.520 --> 13:11.720
[Don't touch it!
You'll blow us up!]

13:11.800 --> 13:13.640
[Samir, calm down.]

13:13.720 --> 13:15.520
[-He's not focused.]
[-Calm down.]

13:15.600 --> 13:18.160
[He understands only
when you yell at him.]

13:18.360 --> 13:19.960
[Okay.]

13:21.680 --> 13:23.640
[-Is everything understood?]
[-Yes.]

13:23.720 --> 13:29.080
[Good. Now I will try to put it on you,
nice and slow.]

13:32.800 --> 13:35.000
[-Slide your arm in there.]
[-Slowly.]

13:38.880 --> 13:40.440
[Grab this.]

13:41.600 --> 13:45.880
[You can fasten it tightly,
as long as it's comfortable.]

13:45.960 --> 13:49.400
[Now Khaled can't say that we
don't worry about comfort.]

13:50.360 --> 13:51.800
[Keep working.]

13:51.880 --> 13:55.080
[-Is that comfortable?]
[-Yes, yes.]

13:55.680 --> 13:57.600
[Alright.
Now, this pocket--]

13:57.680 --> 13:59.040
[Let's put that there.]

13:59.120 --> 14:01.920
[We leave that pocket empty
for the added <i>elemen</i>t]

14:02.000 --> 14:05.200
[-which you'll receive in half an hour.]
[-What element?]

14:05.280 --> 14:08.200
[Something extra.
You'll know soon enough.]

14:09.280 --> 14:10.760
[Don't be scared.]

14:10.840 --> 14:12.520
[One of the best <i>Mujahidee</i>n
<i>(Jihad warriors)</i>]

14:12.600 --> 14:15.360
[in the history of Islam
will give it to you.]

14:15.560 --> 14:18.160
[-See? Now he's listening.]
[-He sure is.]

14:18.240 --> 14:19.600
[Alright then.]

14:34.920 --> 14:36.480
[Come in.]

14:47.480 --> 14:49.120
[They're beautiful. Thanks.]

14:49.200 --> 14:50.240
[That's nothing.]

14:50.320 --> 14:54.840
[I'm planning the biggest wedding ever,
it will last three whole days.]

14:54.920 --> 14:58.080
[I'll be scattering roses
all over the city, just for you.]

14:58.160 --> 15:00.440
[It will be the talk of the town.]

15:02.000 --> 15:03.640
[What is it?
Why aren't you happy?]

15:03.720 --> 15:05.840
[Everything is fine.]

15:08.360 --> 15:09.880
[Shirin.]

15:12.760 --> 15:14.320
[Shirin!]

15:15.440 --> 15:18.720
[We're getting married soon.
We must be honest with each other.]

15:18.800 --> 15:21.400
[-Whatever bothers you, bothers me.]
[-Walid...]

15:22.280 --> 15:23.960
[You're my cousin.]

15:24.040 --> 15:27.160
[I love you, but this isn't right.]

15:27.240 --> 15:29.280
[What isn't right?]

15:30.880 --> 15:33.320
[I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.]

15:33.400 --> 15:35.680
[Wait, after the wedding
you'll be completely safe.]

15:35.760 --> 15:37.920
[No, Walid,
I can't do this.]

15:38.000 --> 15:39.760
[-Shirin, just--]
[-I can't go on with this.]

15:39.840 --> 15:42.840
[-Wait a couple of days.]
[-No, I can't marry you.]

15:43.600 --> 15:46.280
[What do you mean,
you can't marry me?]

15:47.000 --> 15:49.560
[We can't get married.]

15:50.000 --> 15:52.040
[Why? Why?]

15:52.120 --> 15:54.160
[Because I don't love you.]

15:55.680 --> 15:57.800
[You're kidding, right?]

15:58.880 --> 16:00.720
[Huh?]

16:01.000 --> 16:03.520
[-You're kidding, right?]
[-No.]

16:05.360 --> 16:07.320
[-Is this because of him?]
[-Who?]

16:07.400 --> 16:10.000
[That bastard from the
the Palestine Preventive Security!]

16:10.080 --> 16:12.760
[-Your Amir Mahajne?!]
[-No.]

16:12.840 --> 16:14.800
[Then why? Why?!]

16:16.240 --> 16:17.880
[Tell me.]

16:18.520 --> 16:20.160
[Tell me!]

16:20.720 --> 16:22.080
[Do you love him?]

16:24.960 --> 16:26.760
[Do you?]

16:27.120 --> 16:28.800
[Do you?]

17:03.200 --> 17:06.720
PALESTINE PREVENTIVE SECURITY HQ
RAMALLAH

17:22.600 --> 17:25.960
[Hold it. Where to?]

17:26.040 --> 17:27.440
[Where is Abu Maher?]

17:27.520 --> 17:29.520
[He's busy at the moment,
he can't see anyone now.]

17:29.600 --> 17:31.480
[Yes, he can,
and I need to see him at once.]

17:31.560 --> 17:33.480
[I told you, he's busy.
He can't see you now.]

17:33.560 --> 17:35.200
[I can take a message
if you want.]

17:35.280 --> 17:36.520
[-A message?]
[-A ha.]

17:36.600 --> 17:38.680
[-Here's my message.]
[-Whoa!]

17:39.520 --> 17:42.320
[Who do you think you are,
you little shit?!]

17:42.400 --> 17:44.400
[I'll blow your brains out
all over the walls.]

17:44.480 --> 17:47.600
[To hell with you,
Abu Ahmad and Abu Samara.]

17:47.680 --> 17:49.400
[You can all suck my dick!]

17:49.480 --> 17:52.080
[Come here again,
and I'll slaughter you, you swine!]

17:52.160 --> 17:53.880
[Enough!]

17:53.960 --> 17:57.280
[Don't do anything
you'll regret.]

18:00.040 --> 18:01.000
[Good, you're here.]

18:01.080 --> 18:03.680
[We won't have to look for you.
You're going to jail.]

18:03.760 --> 18:05.440
[Do whatever you like,]

18:05.520 --> 18:07.720
[but first hear me out.]

18:10.800 --> 18:13.520
[-He killed two of your men?]
[-Two of our bravest.]

18:13.600 --> 18:16.600
[And he had an affair with an engaged
woman from your family?]

18:16.760 --> 18:20.320
[He violated my honor
and my family's honor.]

18:20.920 --> 18:22.320
[Hold on.]

18:22.920 --> 18:24.320
[Najib.]

18:33.720 --> 18:35.040
[Yes?]

18:35.360 --> 18:38.120
[Walid told me
some very disturbing things.]

18:38.200 --> 18:39.760
[What is it?]

18:40.280 --> 18:44.040
[Seems that one of our guys
killed two of his guys.]

18:44.160 --> 18:47.080
[-Very disturbing indeed.]
[-That's not all.]

18:47.440 --> 18:50.920
[He's also having an affair
with an engaged woman.]

18:52.080 --> 18:54.640
[But that's forbidden.]

18:54.840 --> 18:56.960
[That's what I told Walid.]

18:57.200 --> 19:00.280
[Did he give you the name
of our guy?]

19:00.360 --> 19:01.880
[Tell him.]

19:01.960 --> 19:03.840
[Amir Mahajne.]

19:09.240 --> 19:11.240
[Why are you laughing?]

19:12.360 --> 19:14.400
[Go get the USB.]

19:19.240 --> 19:21.920
[I don't know who
he's killed or fucked,]

19:22.000 --> 19:24.480
[but I'll tell you two things:]

19:24.560 --> 19:26.520
[Amir Mahajne is a Jew,]

19:26.600 --> 19:29.360
[and you and your friend
recruited him, not us.]

19:30.880 --> 19:33.360
[Want to hear him
speak Hebrew?]

19:38.280 --> 19:41.720
[-Ready?]
[-Yes, I'm ready.]

19:41.800 --> 19:44.680
There's one thing
we need to clear first.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.240
[What is it?]

19:47.320 --> 19:50.200
[Does the name Taufiq Hammed
sound familiar?]

19:50.480 --> 19:52.280
[The Panther.]

19:52.640 --> 19:55.960
[-He's waiting for you.]
[-In heaven.]

19:56.040 --> 19:58.560
[He's closer than you think.]

20:00.680 --> 20:03.240
[You're going to meet the Panther.]

20:05.760 --> 20:07.320
[Where?]

20:07.400 --> 20:08.560
[I don't know.]

20:08.640 --> 20:10.720
[They wouldn't even tell me.]

20:12.680 --> 20:15.000
[You'll get the details
on the way.]

20:15.280 --> 20:16.560
[Hold on.]

20:16.640 --> 20:19.560
[-What's up?]
[-Did you leave already?]

20:20.040 --> 20:21.760
[We're about to set out.]

20:22.440 --> 20:24.480
[Can the volunteer hear me?]

20:25.120 --> 20:26.880
[-No.]
[-Good. Listen.]

20:27.120 --> 20:29.320
[I'm about to tell you
something surprising.]

20:29.400 --> 20:32.200
[-So stay calm and act natural.]
[-I'm listening.]

20:32.280 --> 20:34.640
[-Ready?]
[-Talk.]

20:34.720 --> 20:36.800
[The volunteer is a Jew.]

20:44.240 --> 20:45.520
[Elaborate.]

20:45.600 --> 20:47.560
[He's an Israeli soldier.]

20:47.880 --> 20:49.640
[A spy,]

20:50.200 --> 20:53.120
[-from the counter-terrorism unit.]
[-I see.]

20:53.360 --> 20:55.360
[Now listen carefully:]

20:55.440 --> 20:59.240
[Take all of his belongings
and throw them away,]

20:59.720 --> 21:02.480
[as far away as possible,
it's important.]

21:04.080 --> 21:05.600
[What else?]

21:05.680 --> 21:08.400
[After that, put a bullet
through his head.]

21:10.240 --> 21:13.520
[-Are you sure?]
[-100%.]

21:16.560 --> 21:18.640
[Alright.]

21:21.680 --> 21:23.600
[Change of plan.]

21:23.880 --> 21:26.560
[-We leave in 30 minutes.]
[-Is something wrong?]

21:26.640 --> 21:29.640
[No, not at all.]

21:30.120 --> 21:31.680
[That's how the Panther works,]

21:31.760 --> 21:35.560
[always changing things at the last
minute, to be on the safe side.]

21:35.640 --> 21:38.800
[Don't worry.
This is your big day.]

21:39.280 --> 21:41.160
[Wait here, I'll be right back.]

22:11.080 --> 22:13.840
The cigarette packet is moving.
He's on his way.

22:14.680 --> 22:19.160
Nabil, Samah might be on the move,
he's in a pickup truck, it's go time.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.880
-Nurit, where is he?
-Stay on his tail, he's turning right.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.880
-There he is.
-Relax, Steve, this isn't a pursuit.

22:35.960 --> 22:36.760
Okay.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.400
Pass the pickup.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.560
Take it easy.
Steve, slow down!

22:52.080 --> 22:54.120
How come
we didn't see him leave?

22:54.200 --> 22:57.560
Nabil, close in on the pickup.
Make sure Samah is in there.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.960
-If I get too close, we'll be exposed.
-Do as I told you!

23:01.040 --> 23:04.360
Fuck this shit.
Okay, pass the vehicle.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.160
Fuck!
Samah isn't inside the pickup.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.280
-What?
-He's not inside the pickup!

23:15.360 --> 23:17.760
Go back to the junkyard,
they tricked us!

23:17.840 --> 23:19.840
Turn around, quick!

23:22.480 --> 23:23.960
Now, drive!

23:34.240 --> 23:36.680
[-Now it's your turn.]
[-Are we leaving?]

23:36.760 --> 23:38.080
[Shut up.]

23:38.160 --> 23:40.000
You wanted to be a hero, huh?

23:40.080 --> 23:42.960
Now you will die here
like a dog, you filthy Jew!

23:43.040 --> 23:45.520
[-What are you talking about?]
[-What am I talking about?]

23:45.600 --> 23:48.680
[Don't die as a liar, die as a hero,
as a man who fears God.]

23:48.760 --> 23:50.680
[On your knees. Now!]

23:50.840 --> 23:53.120
Get down, I said!

23:53.240 --> 23:56.000
[-Do you fear God? Do you?!]
[-Yes.]

23:56.080 --> 23:57.600
[Pray to Him.]

23:59.520 --> 24:01.920
["There is no god but God]

24:02.000 --> 24:03.880
[and Muhammad
is the messenger of God."]

24:03.960 --> 24:07.240
Pray to your own God.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.520
"Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God,
the Lord is One.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.600
Blessed be the name of the glory
of His kingdom forever and ever."

24:58.480 --> 25:02.080
<i>[Is it not a fact that</i>
<i>there was a time]</i>

25:02.160 --> 25:05.840
<i>[when the human being</i>
<i>was nothing to be mentioned?]</i>

25:06.160 --> 25:09.400
<i>[We created the human</i>
<i>from a liquid mixture,]</i>

25:09.480 --> 25:15.000
<i>[from two parents</i>
<i>in order to test him...]</i>

25:17.080 --> 25:20.760
<i>[thus, we made him</i>
<i>a hearer and a seer.]</i>

25:21.000 --> 25:25.600
<i>[We prepared for the disbelievers]</i>

25:25.680 --> 25:28.920
<i>[chains, shackles,</i>
<i>and a blazing Hell]</i>

25:34.040 --> 25:37.560
[Why are you here early?
Where's the volunteer?]

25:42.680 --> 25:45.160
[Come, I have something
to show you.]

25:47.400 --> 25:49.640
[You won't believe your eyes.]

26:10.240 --> 26:13.400
[Abu Maher's men caught this guy
when he left our quarters.]

26:15.040 --> 26:17.600
[They were sure
he's one of our guys.]

26:22.240 --> 26:24.600
[They sent Captain Ayub over
to interrogate him.]

26:25.480 --> 26:27.280
[Look what they uncovered.]

26:30.360 --> 26:32.040
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

26:32.120 --> 26:35.400
<i>-Gabi, what are you doing here?!</i>
<i>-I'm here on a field day.</i>

26:35.720 --> 26:37.800
[They're friends.]

26:37.880 --> 26:40.280
<i>-I met him.</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

26:40.360 --> 26:41.840
<i>Abu Ahmad.</i>

26:41.960 --> 26:44.920
<i>I met him. I've reached them,</i>
<i>I'm deep inside the system.</i>

26:45.000 --> 26:46.160
<i>-They don't realize who I am.</i>
<i>-Doron </i>--

26:46.240 --> 26:49.960
<i>I can wipe him out right now,</i>
<i>I can finish him, Gabi.</i>

26:50.040 --> 26:51.840
<i>I'm taking you home.</i>

26:53.760 --> 26:55.000
<i>[Warden!]</i>

27:40.080 --> 27:42.640
-Are you okay, bro?
-Go away.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.440
-Do you fuck her in my house?
-Does it matter?

27:59.520 --> 28:03.520
It does, to me. I asked
if you fucked her in my house.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.480
Forget it, it's not about you.

28:06.560 --> 28:11.080
Who is it about then, when you
fuck my wife in my own house?

28:12.640 --> 28:14.680
You know
I'm not that type of person.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.600
You're exactly that type.
You've always been.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.800
-Always a traitor.
-A traitor who just saved your ass!

28:20.880 --> 28:23.240
I should be killing you
right now!

28:23.320 --> 28:27.080
Then why don't you?
Shoot me in the head! Do it!

28:27.160 --> 28:29.640
You want the gun? Huh?!

28:44.520 --> 28:46.120
Do you love her?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.360
I do.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.520
Do you?

29:00.000 --> 29:04.760
-Doron, it's the third time it's ringing.
-Give it to me.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.160
[-Hello?]
[-Hello, Khaled?]

29:12.240 --> 29:15.080
[No, Khaled has left.]

29:15.360 --> 29:16.880
[He'll be back soon.]

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
[-Is this Samah?]
[-Yes.]

29:50.000 --> 29:51.920
[Is he dead?]

30:03.440 --> 30:08.680
[Just so you know, we're not
the ones who killed him.]

30:11.960 --> 30:13.880
[What's the difference?]

30:14.080 --> 30:18.080
[In the end one lives
and one dies. Right?]

30:50.640 --> 30:52.680
[-Who is it?]
[-Amir.]

31:00.400 --> 31:03.240
[It's over.
No need to hide.]

31:03.320 --> 31:05.240
[The nightmare is over.]

31:06.840 --> 31:10.160
[-What about Walid?]
[-He's alive.]

31:12.040 --> 31:14.320
[Let's get you out of here.]

31:14.400 --> 31:17.560
[-Are you hungry?]
[-You have no idea.]

31:28.520 --> 31:30.160
-How are you?
-Fine, and you?

31:30.240 --> 31:31.160
Good, thanks.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.120
[-Care to order?]
[-Sure.]

31:35.520 --> 31:39.920
[I'd like to order breakfast,
please.]

31:41.800 --> 31:44.200
[I'd also like--]

31:44.560 --> 31:46.160
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

31:46.240 --> 31:49.720
<i>-Gabi, what are you doing here?!</i>
<i>-I'm here on a field day.</i>

31:52.000 --> 31:54.480
<i>-I met him.</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

31:54.560 --> 31:56.120
<i>Abu Ahmad.</i>

31:56.240 --> 31:59.240
<i>I met him. I've reached them,</i>
<i>I'm deep inside the system.</i>

31:59.320 --> 32:02.600
<i>-They don't realize who I am.</i>
<i>-Doron--</i>

32:02.920 --> 32:06.720
And some coffee with cream.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.640
<i>[Warden!]</i>

32:08.880 --> 32:10.560
[Thanks.]
