00:36.077 --> 00:38.864
JakelJake!

00:45.920 --> 00:47.911
Jake, it's me.
It's me.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.298
Jake, it's me.
It's me.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.758
Oh, God.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.833
Hey, hey, over here!
Over here!

00:52.844 --> 00:54.175
Hey, hey, over here!
Over here!

00:56.723 --> 00:58.133
Come on.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.478
Oh!

01:22.582 --> 01:25.415
Something pulled you under.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.453
No, no, wait!

01:45.063 --> 01:47.770
I have to see
how you're healing.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.269
Kid's not getting any better.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.315
Kid's not getting any better.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.317
He's not going to.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.323
-He's gonna die.
- Stop.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.202
He's gonna die
and turn into one of those things.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.363
Hold his arms.
Tight.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.993
This is gonna hurt.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.602
- No!

02:32.527 --> 02:34.563
Get his legs.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.151
We can't stay here
much longer.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.369
Do you understand?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.281
We'll starve.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.951
He's too weak.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.581
We'd never get him
past the beach.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.163
Alex, please.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.750
I owe him.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.129
Look, if you care
for this boy,

03:02.140 --> 03:03.425
Look, if you care
for this boy,

03:03.516 --> 03:05.507
you have to consider
what he needs,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.304
you have to consider
what he needs,

03:07.353 --> 03:10.186
what is truly
best for him.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.108
What's the matter with you?
He's burnt to the bone.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.144
He's rotting.
Put him out of his misery, Alex.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.736
He's rotting.
Put him out of his misery, Alex.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.688
You have to
or I'll...

03:30.168 --> 03:31.624
It's okay.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.746
It's okay, Alex.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.506
It's okay.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.218
It's okay.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.967
Pick up, pick up.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.560
Pick up, pick up.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.228
Are you there?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.359
Can you hear me?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.315
I'm coming.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.275
We're in
the Capistrano Bight.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.734
80 miles
north-northwest of--

05:09.142 --> 05:10.882
Can't sleep?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.726
Trav.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.650
Hey.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.567
Are you here?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.205
- Yeah.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.279
What the hell?

06:21.130 --> 06:23.917
Okay, so...

06:24.008 --> 06:27.000
the seawater is what's
cooling the engines.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.086
No water,
the engines overheat.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.171
I'm guessing something's blocking
the water intake.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.297
I'm guessing something's blocking
the water intake.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.966
Pull whatever's blocking it and let's get
the hell out of here.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.676
We got to get under the boat to find
out what it is.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.181
Sun comes up
in a few hours.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.933
I'm not inclined to wait
around for someone

06:40.024 --> 06:41.764
with a .50 caliber
machine gun to roll up on us.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.395
It's pitch-dark.
We don't know what's down there.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.604
We can shine a light.

06:44.695 --> 06:45.901
Should I get you
some flippers?

06:45.988 --> 06:47.603
You going for a swim?

06:47.698 --> 06:49.654
The longer we wait,
the bigger the risk.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.607
I'll do it.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.822
Travis, it's not smart.
It's not safe.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.449
It's not how
we decide things.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.363
I think your man
just decided.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.785
Travis, wait
until daybreak.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.411
Travis, wait
until daybreak.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.295
Maddy, the boat's
got to move.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.452
Pass me that bucket.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.015
Ugh.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.019
Oh, God.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.691
- Oh!

08:48.736 --> 08:50.818
- Whoa.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.194
That's some nasty
shit right there.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.401
Yeah, it's backing up
all the way down those pipes

08:58.454 --> 08:59.739
and backing up
the whole system.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.325
- Can we fix it?
- I can try.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.406
I got to pull that poor
bastard out of the intake,

09:03.417 --> 09:04.748
I got to pull that poor
bastard out of the intake,

09:04.794 --> 09:06.785
pump this sludge out
and see if this filtration system still works.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.286
pump this sludge out
and see if this filtration system still works.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.674
- How long?
- Well, I can rebuild a carburetor,

09:13.719 --> 09:15.755
but boats aren't
really my forte.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.007
How long?

09:18.099 --> 09:19.964
All day.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.801
More or less.
I got to feel my way through it.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.760
I mean, look at this.
If that filter's gone--

09:24.855 --> 09:26.561
We don't have all day.
Get it done.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.599
Hey, man,
I am not the help.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.313
Clearly.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.655
l've upset you.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.692
Forgive me if I neglect certain niceties
in light of our current predicament.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.034
Forgive me if I neglect certain niceties
in light of our current predicament.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.908
You are a skilled
technician and a viable member of this team.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.990
Now, pretty please,
fix the goddamn boat.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.491
Now, pretty please,
fix the goddamn boat.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.080
Yeah.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.087
- Busy.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.711
- How are you feeling?
- Christ, Papa.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.341
- Fine.
- Let me see.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.968
This is infected.
Are you taking your antibiotics?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.890
I'm out.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.772
You're warm.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.524
My shoulder's
just a little sore.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.063
I didn't sleep well,
that's all.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.694
I'll be fine.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.694
I can ask Madison
for some stronger medicine.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.115
I can ask Madison
for some stronger medicine.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.821
We take care
of ourselves.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.661
What do you suggest we do?
Go to Walgreens?

10:31.714 --> 10:33.500
Pretty sure
they're closed.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.177
Don't be confused, Ofelia.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.593
This is a family matter.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.254
I'm not confused.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.010
Madison is our friend.
They've all been there--

10:43.100 --> 10:45.091
If she had to choose
between her daughter and yourself,

10:45.102 --> 10:47.218
If she had to choose
between her daughter and yourself,

10:47.313 --> 10:49.304
who do you think
she would choose?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.815
This stays with us.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.851
Understood?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.020
Do you understand,
Ofelia?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.446
Yes, | understa--

10:59.533 --> 11:01.990
Mom ? Mom.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.658
- Mom.
- Alicia.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.538
I know you're not
running on my deck.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.916
- Jesus, seriously?
- What's wrong?

11:11.003 --> 11:13.665
- What is it?
- Look over there.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.920
Are the fish biting?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.668
Do you see it?

11:16.717 --> 11:19.424
- Is that--
- Suitcases. A lot of luggage.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.878
Holy shit. Where'd that wash up from?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.762
- We need supplies.
- Alicia, no.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.719
I've been watching.
There's no one there. No infected.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.429
All that stuff
is just lying there.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.226
- There's infected in the water.
- We're not gonna swim.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.224
- It's a yard sale. I'll go.
- I'm with you.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.646
- Wait.
- If they're going, I'm going.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.102
No, listen to me,
all of you.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.433
Look, if anything
were to happen to you--

11:35.528 --> 11:38.144
Anything did happen.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.979
We're all in it.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.814
- We've seen and done--
- I know.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.028
So stop putting us
at the kids' table.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.327
- I'll watch her.
- You're gonna get slapped.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.075
Mom, we need more clothes.
We need more meds.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.826
- We need more everything.
- Valid.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.581
So we go while Travis ﬁxes the engine.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.369
We get what we can.
We come straight back.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.374
What's going on?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.672
- Dad, we're going to shore.
- Like hell you are.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.583
- We're not asking for permission.
- Excuse me?

12:00.636 --> 12:02.627
- Yeah, hold on.
- I'll take them.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.753
- Yeah, hold on.
- I'll take them.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.797
The girl is right.
We're wasting time.

12:05.808 --> 12:06.968
The girl is right.
We're wasting time.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.050
Anything goes wrong,
we'll come back quickly.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.767
Anything goes wrong,
we'll come back quickly.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.266
Okay, get in, get out.
Look for sealed pills, clothes, canned food.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.938
Okay, get in, get out.
Look for sealed pills, clothes, canned food.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.603
- And size 13 sneakers if you see them.
- It's on the list.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.817
Hey, if you see anything that's not
completely awful.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.152
lgotyou.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.279
Alicia, I can't do
geriatric chic.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.907
- What's wrong with geriatric chic?
- Relax. I got you.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.242
Get warm clothes, too, okay?
Jackets, sweaters.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.039
It's cold out there
on the water.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.285
It will be warmer
in Mexico.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.124
What does that mean?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.260
Ourcapitan
has a destination.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.636
Ourcapitan
has a destination.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.226
He has from the start.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.182
I found some charts,

12:58.277 --> 13:00.108
a map for a location
in Baja.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.229
What the hell
is in Baja?

13:04.575 --> 13:06.236
Perhaps you should
ask him.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.488
Why didn't you?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.570
I think that conversation
would not end well.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.866
I think that conversation
would not end well.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.874
You'll be more...

13:14.919 --> 13:16.705
diplomatic.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.166
I'm not known
for my diplomacy.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.559
My God.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.868
Okay, let's be quick.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.252
Everyone where
I can see you.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.329
Fill your bags,
come back.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.148
Okay.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.649
I'll only
be a minute, okay?

15:08.741 --> 15:09.947
Okay.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.154
Careful.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.027
Come on, Travis.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.114
Come on.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.330
Tra v--

17:27.421 --> 17:28.581
Travis!

17:45.272 --> 17:46.808
Travis?

18:32.694 --> 18:34.685
All these years never knowing where
you were or what you were doing.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.312
All these years never knowing where
you were or what you were doing.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.072
And now here you are.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.743
l was always there.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.787
l was just hungry.

20:35.817 --> 20:38.194
Look at you.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.662
Bet you can't bite me
through that mask now, can you?

21:15.065 --> 21:17.056
Help me, please.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.307
Help me, please.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.351
God, help me.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.442
God, help me.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.948
Mexico?

21:29.538 --> 21:31.745
Where the hell
are you taking us?

21:31.832 --> 21:34.289
Why don't we start by telling me who's been
meddling in my business?

21:34.334 --> 21:36.416
This is my business.
It's all of our business.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.952
- Perhaps our Latin friend?
- Where are we going?

21:39.047 --> 21:41.299
I saved Nick
from that death camp.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.047
And then we saved you,
Victor, remember?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.966
- | welcome you into my home.
- Who got you to your home?

21:45.053 --> 21:47.510
I give you and your family
safe passage on my boat.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.883
And you still don't trust me.
Are we not friends?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.465
Are we going to Mexico?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.019
Please.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.392
In Baja California
there's a town called Rosarito.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.438
In Baja California
there's a town called Rosarito.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.520
Southeast of this town
there are hills.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.606
And in those hills
stands a house.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.902
And in those hills
stands a house.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.451
It has food stores,
gardens,

22:11.496 --> 22:13.452
water filtration
for the well,

22:13.498 --> 22:14.954
reinforced concrete walls.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.078
And l have precious
little time to get there.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.876
It is the only safe place,
the only sound plan.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.669
You said
San Diego was safe.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.088
No longer
on the itinerary.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.507
Why lie?
Why?

22:27.679 --> 22:28.885
Were you going
to abandon us?

22:28.972 --> 22:31.213
How could I abandon
seven people at once?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.304
Let me make it simple.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.015
We're coming with you,
all of us.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.061
And you expect me
to trust you clearly more than you trust me.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.764
We have to trust
each other.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.941
Fine, you know what the real danger
is on the ocean?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.019
It's people.
Strangers. Friends.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.361
It's people.
Strangers. Friends.

22:46.406 --> 22:49.273
- This is my family.
- Exactly.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.941
Your family.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.819
We're just gonna
eat each other alive.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.905
We have to go back to back
to get this done.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.542
Good.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.044
Good.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.547
And, Victor,

23:09.596 --> 23:12.133
you even look wrong
at anyone in my family,

23:12.224 --> 23:13.760
I will throw you
overboard.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.227
You're not a killer.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.345
Hey. I got something for you.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.972
And I think it'll really
bring out your eyes.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.103
Bad luck to steal
from the dead.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.522
You should not
be joking about it.

24:06.319 --> 24:07.980
Ofelia?

24:18.790 --> 24:20.326
This shit won't do, man.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.956
You want the cillins.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.752
Codones.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.831
So amoxicillin,
oxycodone.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.046
Yeah, no,
this is useless.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.771
- Where's Chris?
- I don't know.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.644
Stay with your sister.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.231
Chris!

24:52.365 --> 24:54.151
Chris!

25:05.170 --> 25:07.161
Come on, hurry.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.787
Come on, hurry.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.088
- I got you.
_ NO"

25:28.777 --> 25:30.813
Help me.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.026
Please.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.446
- Here. Come on. Take this. Drink.
- No. No. Enough.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.572
- Here. Come on. Take this. Drink.
- No. No. Enough.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.911
Enough.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.377
Please.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.009
Please.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.737
Chris!

26:59.492 --> 27:02.234
Where is the damn boy?

27:02.329 --> 27:03.444
Chris!

27:10.920 --> 27:12.706
Where are they?

27:12.756 --> 27:14.371
I don't know.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.593
I think he went
to look for Chris.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.598
They're taking too long.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.225
I'm right behind you.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.184
Hold on, Alicia.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.790
Oh, hello.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.926
- Rust.
- You need a hand?

28:02.013 --> 28:03.719
Trust me, you don't
want any of this.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.881
I had to pull apart
the whole filtration system.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.689
I've been talking
to Strand.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.483
Uh-huh.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.240
He has a place
in Baja.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.942
Says it's fortified,
stocked, safe.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.489
Says it's fortified,
stocked, safe.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.498
And he just
came up with this?

28:32.585 --> 28:34.246
It's our best chance.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.372
We should trust him.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.593
Do we have a choice?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.007
Then it's not about trust.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.933
He's come through so far.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.516
Yep, now he has
a magic house in Baja.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.597
Travis, if we don't
have a destination,

28:55.650 --> 28:58.232
then we're just drifting,
just waiting to die.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.605
Maddy, no one wants
to live more than I do.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.646
- Okay, so we agree. - Sounds to me
like you already made your decision.

29:02.657 --> 29:03.942
- Okay, so we agree. - Sounds to me
like you already made your decision.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.983
- | just need us together on this.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.154
- | just need us together on this.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.236
We are together.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.282
We are together.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.364
But I just don't know
where we're going.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.455
But I just don't know
where we're going.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.410
- | just told you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:16.504 --> 29:18.995
That's not what I meant.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.776
Chris?

29:44.449 --> 29:46.110
Chris!

29:50.038 --> 29:52.199
- Stop!
- They're coming!

29:52.290 --> 29:53.700
They're coming!

29:54.959 --> 29:56.699
Run.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.554
Jesus.

32:01.794 --> 32:02.829
Oh, shit!

32:07.258 --> 32:08.464
Chris?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.586
Chris!

32:19.520 --> 32:20.930
Where the hell
were you?

32:20.980 --> 32:22.971
l was in there looking
for some supplies.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.015
Are you hurt?

32:25.026 --> 32:27.142
Are you hurt?

32:27.195 --> 32:29.436
Yeah, no, no.
I'm ok-- I'm okay.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.031
It wasn't--
it wasn't me.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.156
You killed one?

32:49.467 --> 32:51.458
Strand!

32:55.723 --> 32:58.305
We have to move!
We have to move!

32:58.393 --> 33:00.099
We have to move now.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.135
What happened?
Is it Daniel?

33:02.188 --> 33:04.019
- Give it. Start it.
- Go, go!

33:04.065 --> 33:05.305
Start in five.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.240
Daniel.
Where's Nick?

33:16.327 --> 33:18.704
- Let's get back to the boat.
- Where's Nick?

33:23.459 --> 33:25.165
Grab something now.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.182
Alicia!

33:53.948 --> 33:55.734
Christ, Travis.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.492
Ugh.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.570
- Go, go, go!
- Strand! Strand!

34:01.581 --> 34:03.367
- Go, go, go!
- Strand! Strand!

34:50.838 --> 34:52.578
Alicia!

35:12.610 --> 35:13.816
Go, go!

35:34.340 --> 35:35.546
Nick!

35:38.970 --> 35:40.631
Nick!

35:50.064 --> 35:51.770
Nick!

36:01.325 --> 36:03.281
- Nick, are you bit?
- I'm good, I'm good.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.158
- Are you bit?
- No, I'm good.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.863
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

36:13.754 --> 36:15.335
- Go.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.712
We need to make a stop.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.072
Can you tell
if they're okay?

36:44.118 --> 36:45.528
Are they all there?

36:45.620 --> 36:47.906
Yes.
There's more.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.533
What?

36:58.049 --> 37:00.040
- Are you hurt? What happened?
- I don't know exactly.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.257
- Are you hurt? What happened?
- I don't know exactly.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.429
- What happened?
- I'm sorry. / didn't--

37:06.474 --> 37:08.965
We got separated.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.802
I almost lost the kids.

37:14.357 --> 37:17.144
- No.
- They're dehydrated.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.558
I don't care.
There's no room.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.439
Not here.
Not where we're going.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.820
We don 't know where we're going.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.443
Mom?

37:24.533 --> 37:26.273
Yes, we do.
We're going to Mexico.

37:30.289 --> 37:32.371
Strand has a place there.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.372
There '8 food,
power, water.

37:34.418 --> 37:37.330
It's close.
Baja.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.371
He's invited us to stay
till things clear.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.542
He's invited us to stay
till things clear.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.215
- Things will never clear.
- Then we make it our home.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.679
- We don't know that it's safer down there than
anywhere-- - We're gonna find out.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.970
- How do we know it's what he says it is?
- It is what I say it is.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.467
Okay, why didn't this
come up before?

37:49.558 --> 37:51.765
Why are we just
hearing about this now?

37:51.852 --> 37:54.810
Because it's necessary now.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.933
We can't stay
on the water forever.

37:57.024 --> 37:59.891
Madison's right.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.977
We made a decision.
We have our destination.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.148
We made a decision.
We have our destination.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.360
And what about them?

38:13.374 --> 38:15.706
They're a liability. The boy's sick.
He'll turn.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.829
- He'll turn if we don't help him.
- Madison, please.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.626
Fine, fine, fine.
They won't come to Mexico.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.955
They just need some medicine
and a place to stay for the night.

38:22.049 --> 38:24.301
Look at him!
He's dying!

38:26.595 --> 38:28.722
Are you people
really debating this?

38:37.398 --> 38:40.105
We can tow them.

38:41.527 --> 38:44.064
We can tow them
to San Diego.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.396
- In their raft.
- Travis, what part of what I'm saying--

38:46.449 --> 38:47.939
They don't come
on the boat, okay?

38:48.034 --> 38:50.025
We're safe,
they get a chance.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.276
We're safe,
they get a chance.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.785
Victor.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.163
We can give you
food, water.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.334
We can give you
food, water.

39:17.646 --> 39:19.147
Okay.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.916
Please, it doesn't
have to be like this.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.793
We can bring them on.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.419
This is the best
I can do.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.306
Nick, you smell
like death.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.352
Nick, you smell
like death.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.923
This is the worst.

41:20.686 --> 41:23.553
It'll never hurt worse
than right now.

41:25.024 --> 41:27.766
And every day
will be a little better.

41:29.361 --> 41:31.693
This is the worst
it's going to be.

41:55.971 --> 41:58.633
What are you doing?

41:58.682 --> 42:01.640
Strand.
Strand!

42:01.685 --> 42:02.891
No.
