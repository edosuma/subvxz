00:01.376 --> 00:04.505
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.588 --> 00:08.217
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.300 --> 00:11.428
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.512 --> 00:14.556
On which we used to rely?

00:14.640 --> 00:18.018
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:18.101 --> 00:21.396
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.480 --> 00:23.065
All the things
that make us

00:23.148 --> 00:24.566
Laugh and cry

00:24.650 --> 00:29.821
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:34.117 --> 00:36.537
MALE TV ANNOUNCER:
Tuesday on Scarecrow and Mrs. King...

00:36.620 --> 00:39.498
My God, what did those
drug dealers do to you?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.708
Oh, they took my chest out
and threw it over there.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.836
Then they pulled my legs out
and threw them over there.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.088
Brian, you're still
watching TV?

00:46.171 --> 00:48.173
God, you've been sitting there
since I left.

00:48.257 --> 00:52.344
Yeah. I spent all morning
watching a VH1 special on Gwen Stefani.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.596
I don't know what
a "hollaback girl" is.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.640
All I know is
I want her dead.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.058
Hey, can you
hand me the remote?

00:58.141 --> 01:00.811
You know, you've been laying
around the house a lot lately.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.689
Why don't you get
a part-time job like Peter used to have?

01:03.772 --> 01:05.816
Ding, fries are done
Ding, fries are done

01:05.899 --> 01:07.651
Ding, fries are done
Ding, fries are done

01:07.734 --> 01:09.778
I gotta run, I gotta run

01:09.862 --> 01:12.114
I gotta run, I gotta run

01:12.197 --> 01:14.992
I work at Burger King making
flame broiled whoppers

01:15.075 --> 01:16.493
I wear paper hats

01:16.577 --> 01:18.620
Would you like an apple pie
with that?

01:18.704 --> 01:21.039
Would you like an apple pie
with that?

01:21.123 --> 01:22.332
Mom, guess what?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.502
I just found out I got that internship
at Mayor West's office.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.796
Wow, congratulations, Meg.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.049
Yeah, it was a really
tough interview, but I totally nailed it.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.678
All right, Meg, we're going to start
with a little word association.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.848
I'll say a word, and you say
whatever comes into your head.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.932
-Okay.
-Mosquito.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.684
-Bite.
-Hmm. Bite.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.269
-Mosquito.
-Ah, yes. Good one.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.353
-Uh, mosquito.
-Bite.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.438
-Mosquito.
-Bite.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.564
-Mosquito.
-Bite.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.648
-Bite.
-Mosquito.

01:46.732 --> 01:50.611
Aha! Very good. You are
a worthy opponent, indeed.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.363
Oh, honey,
I'm so proud of you.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.490
You see, Brian,
Meg has a job.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.202
Hey, Meg, if you're working for the Mayor,
you know what that means?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.162
Even you're doing
better than Brian.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.832
Hey, everybody,
Brian's the new Meg.

02:06.668 --> 02:10.088
Brian's the new Meg.
Brian's the new Meg.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.798
Yeah, you're
the new me.

02:11.882 --> 02:12.883
Shut up, Meg.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.223
Let's go, kids.
Time for school.

02:19.306 --> 02:23.060
Lois, I don't want to ruin your morning,
but I flushed a diaper.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.186
It's a mess up there.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.021
(car horn honking)

02:26.104 --> 02:29.441
Brian, what is this?
You're driving a cab?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.109
Well, Lois,
I realized you were right.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.445
I mean, it's time I went
out and got a job.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.113
For God sakes,
I'm seven years old.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.406
Seven? That's not bad.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.575
You know,
Todd was 15 when he died.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.118
The dog we had before you.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.995
Hey, Peter, did you call me?

02:42.079 --> 02:43.830
Yeah, I thought we'd
go to the park, Todd.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.583
Oh, you're not taking me
to the vet, are you?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.752
No, no, just a nice day
at the park.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.713
I'm a little worried that
you're gonna have me put down.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.549
I know there's been
some concern

02:53.632 --> 02:55.926
about my sphincter's
low shutter speed.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.803
No, no, we're just going
to the park, Todd.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.681
Oh, okay, well, I'll enjoy
the ride, then.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.726
Around the park
one more time, Bitterman.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.436
Peter, I'm not
your chauffeur.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.146
Not for long
with that attitude, Bitterman.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.273
(groans)

03:09.356 --> 03:11.108
Ah! This is living,
Bitterman.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.611
This set of wheels is even better than
those talking cars on that commercial.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.572
Hey, how you doing there?

03:16.655 --> 03:20.993
Listen, uh, I couldn't help but notice
you across the parking lot and, uh...

03:21.076 --> 03:23.787
You know, you're-- you're
very attractive and, uh...

03:23.871 --> 03:26.331
You want to go
behind the Applebee's and do it? Huh?

03:26.415 --> 03:31.128
You want to just go have some dirty,
stupid, insane parking-lot sex?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.380
Chuck, it's me, Morty.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.673
Yeah, 'cause we could...
What?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.508
Yeah, they had me painted.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.886
Oh! Oh, my God,
I'm so embarrassed.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.345
-Oh, my...
-Hey, how do you think I feel?

03:40.429 --> 03:42.222
-No, no, that, too, but...
-It's not all about you, you know.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.016
Morty, oh, my God,
what are you doing? Look at you.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.101
Think I was likea birthday present
for the kid or something like that.

03:46.185 --> 03:49.438
Oh, my God, look at you.
You're-- you're-- you're hot.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.731
I know.
I would've taken you...

03:50.814 --> 03:51.982
You know what I would've
done to you back there?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.859
-Yeah? Why didn't you say
-something earlier?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.068
I said all that stuff. God!

03:55.152 --> 03:56.862
Let's not--
Let's not rule anything out.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.033
Hey, look, there's Lois.
Yeah.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.159
Hey, honk the horn.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.243
(horn honking)

04:04.203 --> 04:05.787
Oh, hi, Peter.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.623
-(laughing) Ram her.
-What?

04:07.706 --> 04:09.082
I said ram her!

04:09.166 --> 04:10.584
Ah! What the hell?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.085
-Now shoot her tires out.
-What?

04:12.169 --> 04:13.170
-You got a gun?
-Well, yeah.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.546
Every cabbie carries
a gun, but...

04:14.630 --> 04:15.797
Give me the gun.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.968
(screaming)

04:21.970 --> 04:24.765
What the hell is wrong
with you, Peter? You could've killed me!

04:24.848 --> 04:26.725
Yeah, but I got
you good, Lois.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.769
Admit it.
Just say it, I got you.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.479
(laughing)

04:30.562 --> 04:32.314
Oh, all right,
you got me.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.608
-(both laughing)
-I told you.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.485
Oh, my God.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.237
Oh, no, what happened here?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.738
Oh, we got into
a little accident.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.281
It's all right.
Oh, no.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.409
Well, I guess accidents happen
when you least expect them.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.162
That's how come
they call them accidents.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.623
Oh, look, you got
the community events cork board

04:49.706 --> 04:51.333
wedged in your grill.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.668
There, that's better.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.336
Don't you all forget
to sign up

04:54.419 --> 04:56.755
for the Quahog Community
Talent Show.

04:56.839 --> 05:00.050
Talent show?
Oh, Peter, that could be fun.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.760
Do you think we have
a chance at winning?

05:01.844 --> 05:04.054
Absolutely. I love being
around the stage.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.431
-Except for that time we went to see
-Phantom of the Opera.

05:06.515 --> 05:12.104
Music is the gift
I give to you

05:12.187 --> 05:14.857
PETER:
Let's see the gross half of your face!

05:14.940 --> 05:16.108
Come on!

05:16.191 --> 05:19.111
Let's see the gross half
of your face so I can get out of here!

05:19.194 --> 05:21.029
That nose better be piggy.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.698
Shut up.
You shut up.

05:23.907 --> 05:30.539
E, E, G, G, G, G,
G, G, G, G, G

05:30.622 --> 05:33.750
B, B, B

05:33.834 --> 05:38.422
B, there it is
(chuckles)

05:38.505 --> 05:41.466
Oh, your old guitar.
I haven't seen that thing in ages.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.970
Well, Lois, I thought you and me
could do a song for the talent show.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.514
It could be just like
the old days when we used to play.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.807
You remember, Lois?

05:48.891 --> 05:51.643
Remember our band,
Handful of Peter?

05:51.727 --> 05:54.521
Hi, there. I'm Peter,
and this is Lois.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.648
We want to talk to you
about a friend of ours.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.150
He's not here tonight.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.110
Although, you know,
he's kind of here, Lois.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.945
You know, you're right.
He kind of is.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.655
Yeah, because he's
in our hearts.

06:03.739 --> 06:07.326
This is a song about that man
and his world

06:07.409 --> 06:08.994
that was taken from him.

06:14.917 --> 06:20.130
Noble Indian chief,
bring us back your ways

06:20.214 --> 06:25.886
You Indians were so awesome
in, oh, so many ways

06:25.969 --> 06:30.807
They all loved each other
regardless of the tribe

06:30.891 --> 06:33.852
One Comanche
needs a cup of sugar

06:33.936 --> 06:36.021
And the Blackfoot
would oblige

06:36.104 --> 06:37.397
Oblige

06:37.481 --> 06:42.110
The only cause of death
was drifting off to sleep

06:42.194 --> 06:44.696
And they left
this piece of wisdom

06:44.780 --> 06:46.823
That we hope
you all will keep

06:46.907 --> 06:48.033
And they said

06:48.116 --> 06:53.038
(babbling)

06:59.628 --> 07:00.838
They're gone now.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.048
How could this have happened?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.716
BOTH: How?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.094
Oh, I haven't thought
about that in years.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.096
You know, it would be fun
to write some new songs.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.723
You know what else is fun?
Watching Mr. Belvedere

07:11.807 --> 07:14.393
without people
talking so loud.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.602
So I was thinking we could...

07:15.686 --> 07:17.312
Streaks on the china

07:17.396 --> 07:19.064
Never mattered before

07:19.147 --> 07:20.399
Who cared

07:20.482 --> 07:22.359
When you drop kick
your jacket

07:22.442 --> 07:24.152
When you came through
the door

07:24.236 --> 07:25.404
No one glared

07:25.487 --> 07:26.697
(cell phone ringing)

07:28.031 --> 07:30.909
Hello. Hey, Lois,
what's up?

07:30.993 --> 07:33.745
Milk? Yeah, I'll pick some up
at the end of my shift.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.373
Oh, gotta go.
First fare of the night.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.962
I should really pick up
that milk now before I forget.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.132
You son of a bitch!

07:47.217 --> 07:49.344
Hey, Brian,
you see that magazine cover right there?

07:49.428 --> 07:50.596
See who's on it?

07:50.679 --> 07:51.847
Yeah, that's Jessica Alba.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.557
Yeah, you want to know
a secret, buddy?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.225
What?
I would do her.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.310
Really?
Oh, yeah.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.396
I just wanted you
to know a little bit about who I am.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.231
Thanks for the milk, Carl.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.485
What the hell? $400?

08:05.569 --> 08:07.487
My God, this is
a bigger rip-off than

08:07.571 --> 08:09.573
Peter's
Sounds of the Rainforest CD.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.367
This will help us
fall asleep, Lois.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.119
(crickets chirping)

08:14.203 --> 08:15.704
(monkeys screeching)

08:21.043 --> 08:22.794
(lion roaring)

08:26.465 --> 08:28.133
(truck backing up)

08:28.217 --> 08:30.427
MAN #1: All right, let's get rid
of all these trees.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.639
MAN #2: Once they're gone, this'll be
a great place to raise cheap beef.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.933
Up yours, Sting!
Yeah, yeah!

08:36.016 --> 08:37.601
Hey, what's that song
he does that I hate?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.269
Uh, "Desert Rose."

08:39.353 --> 08:41.188
Yeah, yeah,
that song sucks.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.314
(electric saw whirring)

08:44.149 --> 08:46.902
Meg, I'm going to lunch now,
and I'm having pizza.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.987
So if you see
the Noid running around,

08:49.071 --> 08:51.615
tell him if he ruins
my pizza's freshness,

08:51.698 --> 08:53.742
I'll snap his neck.

08:56.078 --> 08:59.289
Hey, Meg, I need to see
the Mayor about this $400 parking ticket.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.500
Brian, you can't
just barge in here.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.960
You have to make
an appointment.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.087
But this is
flat-out extortion.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.423
No, it's not. Adam can charge
whatever he wants for a parking ticket.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.884
You know, Meg,
that guy's been playing fast and loose

09:10.968 --> 09:12.761
with his position
for years now, and I've had it.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.429
He's a corrupt bastard.

09:14.513 --> 09:15.514
That is not true.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.099
Yes, it is.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.476
Somebody's got to stand up
and prove to this town that he's a crook.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.478
And it looks like
it has to be me.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.398
What was all the commotion?

09:24.481 --> 09:25.607
Oh, nothing,
it was just...

09:25.691 --> 09:27.109
(giggling)

09:28.443 --> 09:29.444
(shouting)

09:39.204 --> 09:40.414
(grunting)

09:40.497 --> 09:41.498
(neck snapping)

09:46.336 --> 09:49.882
Perhaps it was the Noid
who should've avoided me.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.974
Oh, you know what, Brian?

09:59.057 --> 10:01.935
It took me two hours
to spell "hat" with these things.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.021
I finally got the "T"
right side up,

10:04.104 --> 10:05.856
and then you come in here...

10:05.939 --> 10:08.275
You're a bastard.
Where are you going?

10:08.358 --> 10:11.904
I'm going to expose Mayor West
as the corrupt politician that he is.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.823
I'm on my way to meet a source
who won't talk to me over the phone.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.492
Ooh! Scandal in Quahog.
Count me in.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.459
Thank you for coming,
Deep Throat.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.961
You'll understand
if I don't come out from the shadows.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.756
My identity will be safest
if you never see my face.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.216
Uh, okay.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.843
Mayor West hasn't slept
at home for three nights.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.345
Kermit the Frog?

10:36.428 --> 10:38.639
(gasps)
Somebody talked! No one is safe!

10:38.722 --> 10:39.765
I'm getting out of here!

10:39.848 --> 10:40.933
(exclaiming)

10:41.934 --> 10:43.352
What's his appeal?

10:45.229 --> 10:49.650
They should make a tube
that sends you right to work

10:49.733 --> 10:52.486
That would save
a lot of gas

10:52.569 --> 10:55.572
But I guess there'd be
a lot of tubes

10:55.656 --> 10:57.199
Well, that wasn't
very good.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.243
We're never gonna
win that talent show.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.869
Hey, now, Peter,
you gotta remember

11:00.953 --> 11:02.663
that when we used
to write the old songs,

11:02.746 --> 11:05.999
we had a lot
of "inspiration," huh?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.794
You know, I think Brian
may have some inspiration

11:08.877 --> 11:10.337
in a cigar box under his bed.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.881
I don't know, Lois.
I don't think this is gonna work.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.092
Come on, we can't
give up on our goals.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.177
What if Jesus had done that?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.387
(children clamoring)

11:22.015 --> 11:24.935
Why is the ironing board
still out?

11:26.770 --> 11:31.733
That's-- That's my favorite
picture of Brian over there on that wall.

11:31.817 --> 11:35.445
He wants to have
sex with me so bad.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.323
(LAUGHING)

11:38.824 --> 11:40.033
He's not...

11:40.117 --> 11:42.744
He's not gonna get to.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.037
(laughing)

11:51.795 --> 11:53.505
All right. There he goes.
Let's move.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.551
I say,
what are we looking for?

11:57.634 --> 12:00.304
I don't know, some proof
of Mayor West's corruption.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.890
What are you doing here, Brian?

12:02.973 --> 12:04.266
Still trying to smear my boss?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.768
No, no, no. I actually
came to my senses

12:06.852 --> 12:08.687
and realized I was
out of line.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.522
Uh, I'm just here
to apologize.

12:11.648 --> 12:16.028
Oh, and, uh,
you're so pretty.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.864
You're always pretty.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.033
Oh, you guys are so sweet.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.619
Oh. Well, it's my pleasure.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.162
Hey, can you guys
hold on a sec?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.705
I gotta get this
to Helen in Accounting.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.624
Okay, bye.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.083
(retching)

12:32.002 --> 12:33.003
Aha!

12:33.086 --> 12:34.087
The Mayor's date book.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.756
This should tell us
what we wanna know.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.424
All right,
let's get out of here.

12:37.508 --> 12:40.469
Oh, God, I feel more delirious
than my cousin, Stewie Cruise.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.805
I'm in love with Katie Holmes!
I'm in love with Katie Holmes!

12:43.889 --> 12:46.266
I'm not gay!
Go see my new movie!

12:46.350 --> 12:48.852
I'm in love with Katie Holmes!
I'm not gay!

12:50.562 --> 12:52.940
All we need is
one incriminating entry in this date book,

12:53.023 --> 12:54.191
and that's our ticket to...

12:55.442 --> 12:57.945
Hey, Brian.
What's up?

12:58.028 --> 13:01.573
Uh, hi, uh,
Lois, Peter.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.826
Brian, did you know
this couch was here?

13:04.910 --> 13:07.621
It's so comfortable.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.457
Hey, Lois,
look how short Stewie is.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.335
(giggling)
He's so short.

13:14.545 --> 13:17.506
Oh, my God.
He is short.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.847
Well, uh, you two are
busy being nude.

13:24.930 --> 13:29.518
So, um, we'll
just, uh, head out and, uh...

13:29.601 --> 13:32.688
let you be nude.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.773
Who were those guys?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.775
I don't know.

13:36.859 --> 13:37.901
Room for one more?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.653
(vocalizing)

13:42.656 --> 13:44.950
Well, this is
the last entry in the date book.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.704
"Super secret meeting
at motel. Inform no one."

13:48.787 --> 13:50.163
I think we got him now.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.291
You know, you really shouldn't
lie on that bedspread.

13:52.374 --> 13:55.586
I saw this report
on TV about how filthy hotel rooms are.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.713
In a moment,
we will use the special lights

13:57.796 --> 14:01.758
to see just how filthy
this seemingly clean hotel room really is.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.135
(animals calling)

14:07.681 --> 14:09.349
Well? What do you see?

14:12.311 --> 14:15.856
Oh, Jem, you are
truly outrageous.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.734
Truly, truly,
truly outrageous.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.737
I see a grown man
enjoying cartoons.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.072
(SIGHING)
Well, that's it, then.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.825
The only thing this guy
is guilty of is being a whack job.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.577
Wait, wait, wait.
Somebody's coming in.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.871
Oh, it's just
some fat hooker.

14:30.954 --> 14:34.041
Oh, my God, it's Meg!

14:34.124 --> 14:35.918
-What?
-Meg and Adam West.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.336
Ew!

14:37.419 --> 14:38.754
-(sheep bleating)
-Oh, oh. Sorry, sorry.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.263
God, this is incredible.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.974
The Mayor is dating
a teenage intern, and it's Meg.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.518
What a story.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.770
This is the perfect scandal
to take him down.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.271
All we need is
taped evidence.

14:56.355 --> 14:58.357
Well, I've got
the disguises right here.

15:00.359 --> 15:03.028
I thought you were
supposed to get the suit and the top hat.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.279
I liked this one better.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.406
Anything to wear
a dress, huh?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.954
Gosh, you're swell, Meg.

15:12.037 --> 15:14.122
I really have a great time
when I'm with you.

15:14.206 --> 15:16.959
Oh, Mayor West, I feel
exactly the same way.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.211
Oh, please, please.
Call me Mayor ChapStick.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.631
Well, we should probably go.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.716
(gasps)
Here they come. Kiss me.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.054
Come on, we gotta follow them.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.639
Stewie?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.057
Huh? Oh. Oh.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.934
Everything all right?
Uh, yeah.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.394
Uh...

15:35.477 --> 15:37.688
Hey, listen,
freaking shot in the dark.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.481
You wanna do
something sometime?

15:42.526 --> 15:43.986
Great practice, Lois.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.405
We are totally ready
for that talent show.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.324
Oh, my God, Peter,
I am so wasted.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.118
All I want to do
is make cookies.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.995
(gasps)
Oh, my God, I have a great idea.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.121
Let's make cookies.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.622
We don't have to, Lois.

15:55.706 --> 15:59.418
Look, there's a magical land
of desserts right behind you.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.424
(both laughing)

16:11.972 --> 16:14.391
Help! Stop!

16:18.896 --> 16:19.897
(gasps)

16:20.022 --> 16:22.441
Oh, Brian. You scared me.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.734
Another late night, huh?

16:23.817 --> 16:26.069
Yeah, Mayor West
keeps me pretty busy.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.071
Yeah, I noticed.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.408
(gasps)
Where did you get that?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.493
Meg, what the hell
have you gotten yourself into?

16:33.577 --> 16:35.662
You realize he probably
does this with every new intern.

16:35.746 --> 16:38.248
That's not true.
Adam and I are in love.

16:38.332 --> 16:39.625
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.503
Listen, I'm warning you
because I care about you.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.297
I am going to the press
with this story, and when it hits,

16:45.380 --> 16:47.883
it'll be bigger
than Uncle Sam's nipples.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.594
Jeez! What the hell?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.429
Uh, they're called
nipples, guys.

16:52.513 --> 16:53.889
They're freaking huge.

16:53.972 --> 16:56.683
You know what? Maybe we can just all relax
and enjoy the sauna.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.438
Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles

17:01.522 --> 17:03.273
Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles

17:03.357 --> 17:05.067
I have to tell you
something, Adam.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.527
You're an alien. I know.

17:06.610 --> 17:11.031
No, no, my dog is gonna expose
our relationship to the press.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.282
Well, so what?

17:12.366 --> 17:14.618
You and I know
that we haven't done anything wrong.

17:14.701 --> 17:18.622
I told you that I'd
wait for you until you're 18 or 21.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.166
Or maybe 25,
when you can legally rent a car.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.334
They don't care.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.961
They're gonna make you
look like a monster.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.045
I see.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.672
Well, Meg,
I'm a public figure.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.465
I'm used to
the tabloids' doodie.

17:28.549 --> 17:29.967
It's you I'm worried about.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.011
You're just a sweet young lady
with her whole life ahead of her.

17:33.095 --> 17:37.307
This story could ruin your future,
and I can't let that happen.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.935
I'll take the fall,
no matter what.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.483
Good-bye, Meg.
I'll always value your friendship.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.819
I love you, Mayor ChapStick.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.321
(sighs)

17:51.405 --> 17:52.948
(Brian clearing his throat)

17:53.031 --> 17:55.367
(gasps) Brian?
What are you doing here?

17:55.450 --> 17:59.246
I, uh, just wanted
to give you this.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.498
I don't think
I'll be needing it anymore.

18:01.582 --> 18:03.667
I got so caught up in
taking down Mayor West

18:03.750 --> 18:06.086
that I just lost sight
of right and wrong.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.963
Oh. Thank you, Brian.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.673
Well, can I give you
a lift home?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.049
My cab's right outside.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.926
(shouting)

18:16.096 --> 18:17.347
(roaring)

18:23.645 --> 18:25.564
Good evening.
I'm Diane Simmons,

18:25.647 --> 18:28.984
and I'd like to welcome you
to Quahog's Fifth Annual Talent Show.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.695
Let's have a round of applause
for our first performer.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.406
There's no mustache
like my father's mustache

18:34.489 --> 18:37.534
That's the biggest mustache
in town

18:38.702 --> 18:39.786
Play me off, Johnny.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.587
Huh, what else be funny tonight?

18:48.670 --> 18:51.256
Uh, Star Jones got married.
That was in the news.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.717
Married a black fellow,
which is quite a surprise

18:53.800 --> 18:55.802
because I'd call her
quite a catch.

18:55.886 --> 18:59.473
And black guys, by and large, they're not
so helpful on a fishing vessel.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.100
Now, Portuguese,
absolutely, absolutely.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.229
I even had a couple
of Japanese guys who worked out great.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.481
Thank you very much.
You guys have been terrific.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.735
And now, our final performance
of the night.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.279
Let's hear it
for Handful of Peter.

19:14.363 --> 19:16.240
(audience applauding)

19:21.119 --> 19:26.542
In God's eyes,
everybody's hot

19:29.461 --> 19:34.925
This world has beauty
all through her

19:37.803 --> 19:42.683
Picture the fattest chick
you know

19:46.520 --> 19:51.817
God would totally do her

19:54.236 --> 19:58.282
He'd do her all the way
Even call her the next day

19:58.365 --> 20:01.869
To see how
her work was going

20:02.995 --> 20:05.581
(audience cheering)

20:06.999 --> 20:10.210
I can't believe we lost the talent show.
What'd we do wrong?

20:10.294 --> 20:12.379
Well, Dad, I think I can shed
a little light on that.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.173
You guys were so baked,

20:14.256 --> 20:17.050
you didn't sound anywhere
near as good as you thought you did.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.302
I was in the audience.

20:18.385 --> 20:22.890
(both shouting)

20:26.852 --> 20:28.228
Ah! Ah! Ah!

20:28.312 --> 20:31.440
Oh. And here we thought
the weed was inspiring us.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.026
Well, that's a popular
misconception, Mom and Dad.

20:34.109 --> 20:38.155
But the fact is
the chief ingredient in marijuana is THC,

20:38.238 --> 20:39.865
a mild form of acid,

20:39.948 --> 20:42.576
prolonged usage of which
can cause adverse effects

20:42.659 --> 20:45.287
to your sexual potency,
short-term memory loss,

20:45.370 --> 20:48.165
and can also severely damage
your brain tissue,

20:48.248 --> 20:50.417
central nervous system
and basic motor skills.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.336
To put it simply,
Mom and Dad,

20:52.419 --> 20:55.130
there's a reason
that they call it dope.

20:55.214 --> 20:57.341
Trying to watch
Mr. Belvedere.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.176
So my advice to
the two of you would be...

20:59.259 --> 21:01.553
According to
our new arrival

21:01.637 --> 21:04.306
Life is more than
mere survival

21:04.389 --> 21:07.142
And we just might
live the good life yet

21:07.226 --> 21:11.772
(vocalizing)

21:16.944 --> 21:18.946
(theme music playing)
