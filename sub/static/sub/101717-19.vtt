COOPER: Previously
on The Blacklist...

00:02.470 --> 00:04.438
I used to believe
in salvation.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.807
(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, no.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.342
(GUNSHOT)

00:08.476 --> 00:10.944
That good
was rewarded...

00:11.079 --> 00:12.980
(GRUNTING)

00:13.114 --> 00:14.448
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)

00:18.152 --> 00:19.687
...and evil punished.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.992
(VOICE BREAKING) But I don't
believe in that anymore.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.229
Not in this life.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.797
I've opened up
a new directive,

00:29.930 --> 00:31.799
like the one for Rostova,
but double the bounty.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.201
ENGEL: That won't
be necessary.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.469
I'll be there.
With Keen.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.805
Looking for me?

00:37.938 --> 00:39.273
Drive!

00:39.407 --> 00:40.808
ARAM: Liz, put the gun down.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.510
Not until I get the answer
I'm looking for!

00:45.479 --> 00:47.848
No! He knows
where Townsend is!

00:47.981 --> 00:49.117
COOPER: We have her
in custody.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.384
REDDINGTON: Harold,
bring her here.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.985
I'm the only one
who can save her.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.254
Not today.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.489
Elizabeth Keen
is a criminal.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.425
She will never
be an agent again.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.727
She will never
be a civilian.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.931
Her only hope for survival
exists in my world.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.067
****

01:19.180 --> 01:20.514
(DOOR OPENS)

01:21.449 --> 01:23.083
Mr. Townsend
is sleeping.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.285
Keen is being moved.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.719
He can't be disturbed.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.188
I need to see him.
We have people
in position...

01:27.321 --> 01:28.522
He was very clear.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.091
Keen is in FBI custody.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.393
So?

01:32.526 --> 01:37.064
So hitting
a federal convoy
is public.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.966
Messy.
I need to see him.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.234
Hey.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.236
We work for a madman.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.604
I'm separating
the man's medications,

01:43.737 --> 01:45.038
so I know
better than anyone else.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.073
He's totally insane.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.841
This is insane.

01:47.975 --> 01:48.909
Watch your words.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.010
He's feeding off this.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.445
Destroying himself
and us.

01:51.579 --> 01:52.880
The FBI raided us.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.082
There are warrants
for our arrest.
You're out of line.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.750
I mean, what the hell
is this even about?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.819
Elizabeth Keen
has to die.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.222
We should go out,
shoot feds,

02:01.355 --> 02:02.556
risk our own lives
for some lunatic?

02:02.690 --> 02:03.791
What did you call him?

02:03.924 --> 02:05.293
What did you call
Mr. Townsend?

02:05.426 --> 02:07.361
I didn't mean...
I didn't...

02:07.495 --> 02:10.731
The man
is avenging the death
of his wife and children,

02:10.864 --> 02:12.733
which means we are
the only family he has left.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.270
So we will take care of him
the way he takes care of us.

02:16.404 --> 02:19.207
Now let me do my work

02:19.340 --> 02:22.710
and don't ever disparage
the good man again.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.578
****

02:27.681 --> 02:29.750
****

02:38.592 --> 02:39.993
Where are they?

02:40.127 --> 02:42.162
The decoy convoy
is passing through
the Seventh Ward.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.130
Keen and Ressler?

02:43.264 --> 02:44.265
They held back.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.866
Left just six minutes ago.

02:45.999 --> 02:50.571
Thank you. Best guess is
they are 23 minutes out.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.005
COOPER: No interference?

02:52.139 --> 02:54.074
ARAM: Uh, nothing yet.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.010
Maybe Townsend isn't crazy
enough to hit an FBI convoy.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.812
You really believe that?

02:58.946 --> 03:01.615
I do not. Just, uh, trying
to stay optimistic here.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.254
Why are you doing this?

03:07.988 --> 03:10.658
Ressler,
you know what happens
if you take me in.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.626
I know what happens
if I don't.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.994
Townsend won't stop.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.929
And I won't bury you,
Keen.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.164
I won't stand
next to Agnes

03:17.298 --> 03:18.366
while she cries
at your funeral.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.833
You think I'm safer
in custody?

03:20.934 --> 03:22.836
Townsend has people
everywhere.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.171
He can hit me
from the inside.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.706
I won't last more than
a few days.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.674
We'll see.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.845
Even if you're right,
what then?

03:31.979 --> 03:34.982
It's over. I'll never
be an agent again.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.384
I'm going to prison.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.885
You don't know that.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.020
If Reddington
can still walk around,
you can walk too.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.922
The rules are different
for Reddington.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.227
Look, what I've done,
I can't undo.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.196
Mary Bremmer's death?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.231
The bomb in Reddington's
hospital room?

03:51.365 --> 03:53.467
Everything that happened
in Kansas.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.271
You're holding on
to a reality
that doesn't exist.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.674
Ressler, you have
to accept it.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.878
Things are never going back
to the way they were.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.615
REDDINGTON: I tried
to convey this, Harold.

04:07.748 --> 04:12.386
But once again,
we find ourselves
in a situation where,

04:12.520 --> 04:15.188
when faced
with a unique,

04:15.323 --> 04:16.557
complicated,

04:16.690 --> 04:19.860
and volatile set
of circumstances,

04:19.993 --> 04:23.431
you immediately punt
to bureaucratic protocol.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.399
Elizabeth's coming in.
I'm not releasing her,

04:25.533 --> 04:26.634
and you can be damn sure

04:26.767 --> 04:28.902
I'm not turning her
over to you.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.305
Things have changed.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.341
From the day I arrived,

04:33.474 --> 04:34.708
my intent has been

04:34.842 --> 04:36.410
to keep Elizabeth safe.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.578
To do that,

04:37.711 --> 04:38.712
I had to keep

04:38.846 --> 04:40.514
certain facts

04:40.648 --> 04:41.882
about my life hidden.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.717
Well, the truth is out.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.353
Whatever you're hiding,
Townsend knows.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.421
Yes, and because
he knows,

04:47.555 --> 04:49.523
his focus has shifted

04:49.657 --> 04:52.059
away from me
and onto Elizabeth.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.427
Why?

04:55.228 --> 04:57.030
To try to
make me understand

04:57.164 --> 04:58.231
how he suffered

04:58.366 --> 05:00.067
the day his family
was slaughtered.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.169
So he wants to kill Elizabeth
to make you suffer?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.904
Not just suffer.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.839
To understand.

05:05.973 --> 05:10.744
He experienced something
too dark to comprehend.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.814
To avenge what was done
to his family and to him,

05:15.215 --> 05:19.252
he wants to feel
that I've experienced

05:19.387 --> 05:22.690
a similar darkness
for myself.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.157
(GASPS)

05:28.396 --> 05:29.963
COOPER: Why are you
telling me this now?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.965
REDDINGTON: Because
you can't protect her, Harold.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.368
And you're about to find out
what you're up against.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.307
Part of it's my fault.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.610
I didn't stop you
before you went too far.
(CHUCKLES) Ressler.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.613
All the calls,
going to meet you
without telling Cooper.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.415
That night
you showed up
at my apartment.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.284
You weren't wrong
for wanting to help me.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.554
But I didn't help, Liz.
I only made it worse.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.656
I mean, I let how much I care

05:55.789 --> 05:57.391
about you cloud my judgment.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.092
This wasn't about
your judgment.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.561
I knew exactly
what I was doing.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.466
Look, if Reddington wants
to keep his secrets,

06:07.635 --> 06:08.569
it's fine.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.004
He can keep them all.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.807
Except for the ones that are
truth about my life

06:13.941 --> 06:15.308
and my daughter's life.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.345
Except for
the ones that explain

06:18.479 --> 06:21.449
why psychotics like Townsend
wake up every morning

06:21.582 --> 06:23.016
drooling about new
and exciting ways

06:23.150 --> 06:24.818
to murder me
and my daughter

06:24.952 --> 06:26.820
as payback for
something he did.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.223
Those he doesn't
get to hide.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.859
And I'm telling you
right now.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.194
I am so tired of
the double standard.
What double standard?

06:34.327 --> 06:36.329
You know.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.899
Reddington can do
whatever he wants,

06:39.032 --> 06:42.402
and the Task Force
just takes it in stride.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.704
We don't even know

06:43.837 --> 06:45.405
who he is.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.208
Except for that
he's a Russian spy

06:48.341 --> 06:51.211
who murdered
my adoptive father,
my mother,

06:51.344 --> 06:53.080
is responsible for
the deaths of

06:53.213 --> 06:55.415
my husband,
my half-sister,
my grandfather.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.150
Nobody's okay with that.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.218
You accept it!

06:59.987 --> 07:02.055
Doesn't matter
what he does.
It's okay.

07:02.189 --> 07:06.093
But me? I fight back
and I've "gone too far."

just got here.

Uh, okay, and, uh,

what backup would that be?

07:34.387 --> 07:37.257
We got local. Two MPD units
just joined the convoy.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.693
ARAM: Okay, negative.
I'm checking scanners now,

07:39.827 --> 07:42.329
but we specifically chose not
to ask for city reinforcement.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.897

09:05.646 --> 09:07.047

We cannot stay here.
We got to go.

She's on foot?

09:36.710 --> 09:37.878
In the Seventh Ward.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.212
Less than a minute
ahead of us.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.347
I'm sending more men.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.514
Lock the area down.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.216
Clear every block
until you find her.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.752
And then?

09:44.885 --> 09:46.186
If possible,
bring her to me.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.188
If not,

Attacked by, uh, two gunmen
posing as Metro PD units.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.788
So far they're saying
three agents down,

10:20.921 --> 10:22.890
two in the support vehicle

10:23.023 --> 10:24.357

what about Elizabeth?

She's unaccounted for.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.096
So is Agent Ressler.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.397
Although a witness
claims she saw

10:30.530 --> 10:32.232
a man and a woman
running from the scene.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.068
They're on foot? Where?
What exact location?

10:35.202 --> 10:38.271
ARAM: The convoy was hit
moving southeast
on Central at Wilmont.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.273
That won't be
the end of it.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.942
Townsend will have
more teams on the ground.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.276
Reddington,
we'll handle it.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.778
The area will be
swarming with police.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.079
We're running out
of time, Harold.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.781

22:27.514 --> 22:28.948
Is he handing out money?

22:32.118 --> 22:33.653
Hey, Mister,
can I get one of those?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.354
Depends.
You want a job?

22:35.488 --> 22:36.489
What kind of job?

22:36.623 --> 22:38.324
That money's
a finder's fee.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.126
I'm looking for finders.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.194
And if you're any good,
there's a lot more
where that came from.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.863
Who you trying to find?

22:43.996 --> 22:45.865
Big crash
over on Central.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.967
These two
took off running.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.802
They're hiding somewhere
in the Ward.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.003
You could find them
yourself.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.171
Maybe.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.506
But I know how it goes
around here.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.542
People talk,
but not to outsiders.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.876
If you want to
find someone,

22:57.009 --> 22:59.311
it's best to make arrangements
with the locals.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.213
No trouble,
just information.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.983
If you know where they are,
call the number on the card.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.852
Anybody has a problem,

23:05.985 --> 23:08.755
tell them Mr. Townsend
said it's okay.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.222
****

23:14.527 --> 23:16.829
****

23:26.072 --> 23:27.039
BINO: Anton.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.241
What's up, little man?

23:29.375 --> 23:31.110
****

23:38.885 --> 23:40.887
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

23:42.054 --> 23:43.122
Bino.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.757
I'm hoping
this is good news.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.192
Neville Townsend?

23:46.325 --> 23:47.994
That's who your people
are running from?

23:48.127 --> 23:49.161
Does it matter?

23:49.295 --> 23:50.763
You're damn right it does
and you know it.

23:50.897 --> 23:51.931
If you had told me,

23:52.064 --> 23:53.566
I would've never
gotten involved.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.267
Well, that explains
my reluctance.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.703
I don't believe this.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.037
Do you know what
Neville Townsend
will do to me

23:58.170 --> 24:00.306
when he discovers that
I'm the one who helped you?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.708
Hard to say.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.209
Probably the same thing
I would've done to you

24:03.342 --> 24:04.443
if you hadn't helped me.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.444
This isn't a joke.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.013
I'm not laughing, Bino.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.881
Townsend doesn't know
it was you,

24:09.015 --> 24:10.416
so all we have to do
is keep it that way.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.784
I'm out.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.786
You hear me? I'm out!

24:13.920 --> 24:15.287
It's too late.
You're already in.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.489
They're in transit.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.625
Deal's off.
I'm turning them over.

24:18.758 --> 24:19.959
That would be a mistake.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.093
You should've told me.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.228
Bottom line...

24:22.361 --> 24:25.464
I'm more afraid
of him than I am of you.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.599
Don't do this.

24:26.733 --> 24:27.967
If you give them
to Townsend,

24:28.100 --> 24:29.401
he'll kill them.

24:29.536 --> 24:30.903
Better them than me.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.711
****

24:51.190 --> 24:52.659
We're here.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.460
Head in and take
the staircase
on the right.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.895
That'll lead to
a basement storage room.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.463
Someone will meet you,
take you from there.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.932
Give me a hand.
He needs help getting out.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.433
Ressler.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.002
He's unconscious.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.336
Can you hear me?

25:04.470 --> 25:05.504
Open your eyes, Ressler!

25:05.638 --> 25:06.939
He's still breathing.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.507
The car keys!
Whoa, hang on.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.442
I do not care
where you were
told to take us.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.844
We are going
to a hospital
right now.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.112
Do you understand me?

25:14.581 --> 25:16.683
FBI, Walter.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.517
He's a federal agent.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.352
If he dies,
your life is finished!

25:20.486 --> 25:21.487
Now give me the keys.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.589
Can't go to a hospital.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.091
He's dying!

25:25.224 --> 25:26.959
The nearest hospital
is 30 blocks away.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.460
Your man doesn't have
that kind of time.

25:28.595 --> 25:29.962
He won't make it.
I have to try!

25:30.096 --> 25:31.530
Okay, there's a place.
It's close,

25:31.664 --> 25:33.499
but it's not a hospital.
There's a doctor.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.901
Used to work as a surgeon
before coming to America.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.468
Bino keeps one
on the payroll

25:36.603 --> 25:37.770
in case
one of his people
gets hurt.

25:39.438 --> 25:40.873
What happened to him?

25:41.007 --> 25:42.474
Are you the surgeon?

25:42.609 --> 25:44.977
This is where
you operate?
Who's this?

25:45.111 --> 25:46.145
WALTER: Trust me,
you don't wanna know.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.513
LIZ: Gunshot wound
to the chest,

25:47.647 --> 25:48.981
probably
a collapsed lung.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.482
All you have to do
is stabilize him

25:50.617 --> 25:51.884
until an ambulance
gets here.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.185
(SPEAKS MANDARIN)

25:53.319 --> 25:55.287
Get them out of here.

25:55.421 --> 25:56.488
Please.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.057
Save him.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.927
(LINE RINGING)

26:01.060 --> 26:02.394
Give that back!
They won't let you call.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.063
Whole point is this place
doesn't exist.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.365
No cops, no ambulances.
He can't stay here.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.668
WALTER: Careful now.
You don't want to insult
these good people.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.539
REDDINGTON: Harold,
sad to say things have taken

26:13.673 --> 26:15.207
a nasty turn
for the worse.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.043
The associate
I told you about

26:17.176 --> 26:19.211
has reconsidered
our arrangement.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.413
What do you mean?
I thought Keen and Ressler
were in transit.

26:21.547 --> 26:22.915
I'm sure they are,

26:23.049 --> 26:25.718
but Bino has changed
the delivery address.

26:25.852 --> 26:29.521
He found out that Elizabeth's
being hunted by Townsend,

26:29.656 --> 26:31.223
and he intends to give
Townsend what he wants.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.059
You never told him
it was Townsend?

26:33.192 --> 26:34.927
Of course not. I was trying
to motivate the man.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.729
So now what?

26:36.863 --> 26:38.197
Now we rally, Harold.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.833
Now we shock Mr. Bino
and the rest of them

26:40.967 --> 26:43.002
with our poise
and ingenuity.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.336
And how do we do that?

26:44.470 --> 26:46.005
I have no idea.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.539
Well, that's not
entirely true.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.408
I have one place
to start.

26:49.541 --> 26:52.444
That, uh, bar you mentioned,
is it still a crime scene?

26:52.578 --> 26:55.081
No, Agents Mojtabai and Park
had it processed,

26:55.214 --> 26:56.683
but they cleared out
a little while ago.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.417
Good.
Stay by the phone.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.852
If this works,

26:59.986 --> 27:02.755
you and the Task Force
will need to work quickly.

27:02.889 --> 27:05.457
****

27:13.733 --> 27:14.801
Who are you?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.602
I'm the man you answer.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.304
I'm the man
you tell the truth.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.408
Yeah, sure.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.743
Let's start
with your name.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.344
First is fine.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.713
My name is Arthur.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.080
I clean up mostly,

27:28.214 --> 27:29.481
mop the floors,
take out the trash.

27:29.615 --> 27:30.649
Okay, Arthur.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.151
Two very good friends
of mine

27:32.284 --> 27:34.186
were told to come in
by a man named Bino.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.454
You know the man I mean?

27:35.587 --> 27:38.124
Everybody knows Mr. Bino.
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.927
Bino told them to
come in so they could
enter the pipeline.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.763
Still with me, Arthur?
You know what
I'm talking about?

27:43.896 --> 27:44.897
The pipeline?

27:45.031 --> 27:46.232
So you don't?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.434
Well, that's either true
or you're playing games.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.102
I love games.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.438
In fact,
I'm playing one now,
with dominos.

27:52.571 --> 27:53.806
First, I line them up,

27:53.940 --> 27:55.374
then I knock
the first one over,

27:55.507 --> 27:59.278
and it leads to another
and then another and another

27:59.411 --> 28:01.748
until the trail takes me
where I'm trying to go.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.082
I don't know anything.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.684
Well, I should think not.
You're just the first domino.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.988
Problem is I can't reach
the end of the trail

28:09.121 --> 28:11.490
unless you fall.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.259
Leave him alone.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.660
(CHUCKLES)
Look at that, Arthur.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.163
The second domino
has revealed itself.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.465
I'm the one who
helped your friends.

28:19.598 --> 28:22.568
Sometimes the dominos fall
without even pushing them.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.503
****

28:27.639 --> 28:30.142
****

28:34.947 --> 28:36.983
** I saw the part of you

28:37.116 --> 28:39.752
** That only when you're older
you will see too...

28:39.886 --> 28:41.153
He's stable for now.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.790
But his lung,
it's badly damaged.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.157
I don't know
if it can be saved.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.827
Thank you.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.628
Can I see him?

28:49.762 --> 28:51.163
He's not awake.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.332
Please.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.701
** You held the balance of

28:55.835 --> 28:59.738
** The time that only blindly
I could read you

28:59.872 --> 29:02.541
** But I could read you

29:02.674 --> 29:04.576
** It's like you told me...

29:05.477 --> 29:07.079
Hey.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.081
I'm here.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.183
** It's not a race
to the end...

29:14.086 --> 29:15.187
I've been thinking
about what you said.

29:16.989 --> 29:20.192
How everything I've done,

29:20.326 --> 29:24.463
the choices I've made
are partly your fault.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.301
You know
that's crazy, right?

29:29.435 --> 29:34.373
Aside from being
sort of chauvinistic.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.708
****

29:41.080 --> 29:43.782
You know,
Reddington, Tom.

29:45.852 --> 29:46.785
For whatever reason,

29:46.919 --> 29:48.587
I live in a world where

29:48.720 --> 29:51.590
people aren't
who they seem to be.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.728
It's hard to know

29:59.098 --> 30:00.599
what or who to believe.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.536
But you.

30:06.538 --> 30:07.907
You've always been there.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.311
The real you,

30:13.712 --> 30:14.947
telling me the truth.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.786
And I love you for that.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.488
** But you're somebody else

30:22.621 --> 30:25.124
** Only it ain't
on the surface... **

30:25.958 --> 30:27.159
There, I said it.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.997
It wasn't in the back
of a hearse,

30:31.130 --> 30:33.665
but, hey, the back
of a Chinese restaurant

30:33.799 --> 30:35.067
is pretty good.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.636
****

30:41.573 --> 30:43.275
You're okay.

30:45.611 --> 30:46.946
We're gonna make it
out of here.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.916
I promise.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.286
BINO: Sorry, Ms. Keen.

30:56.822 --> 30:59.291
But that's a promise
you won't be able to keep.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.668
It's like the sewer system,
only with cash.

31:09.801 --> 31:10.937
(CHUCKLES) I like that.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.671
The sewer system
with cash.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.706
Bino's got spots
all over the Ward.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.077
You come in,
ask whoever runs
the spot for a loan,

31:18.210 --> 31:20.312
guaranteed against
your paycheck,

31:20.446 --> 31:22.048
which is coming
but you don't have it yet.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.482
And if you're approved?

31:23.615 --> 31:25.051
We give you the cash.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.153
Or, if you're here
to give back

31:27.286 --> 31:28.820
the loan that
we already gave you,

31:28.955 --> 31:31.023
we accept the money
and flush it to Bino.

31:31.157 --> 31:32.324
Through the pipeline.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.893
Bino's got pipes
all through the Ward.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.128
This is
just one of them.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.529
Bino called me,

31:37.663 --> 31:39.698
said he was sending
two people over

31:39.831 --> 31:42.068
that I should snatch them up
and send them through.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.236
These pipes...
Where exactly
do they lead?

31:44.370 --> 31:45.771
Bino's not stupid.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.074
The runners only know
the next step
in the journey.

31:48.207 --> 31:49.408
The next step then.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.543
I need a name.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.045
WALTER: Walter Stevens.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.546
You two
found the right guy,

31:54.680 --> 31:56.348
but I don't know anybody
named Delores.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.150
It's all right, Walter.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.418
We're associates
of Bino's.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.520
See now, I don't know
who that is either.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.555
You fellas sure you're in
the right neighborhood?

32:03.689 --> 32:04.856
Listen, friend.
I'm not your friend.

32:04.991 --> 32:05.958
Hey, I don't...
I don't know you.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.359
Now's not the time
to be brave.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.262
It's the time
to be smart.

32:10.396 --> 32:13.499
Well, if you two and this
Mr. Bino were really tight,

32:13.632 --> 32:15.201
you'd go ask him
what you want to know

32:15.334 --> 32:16.368
and you'd leave me
the hell alone.

32:16.502 --> 32:17.936
I'm out of time, Walter.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.405
Now, that's
not your fault,

32:19.538 --> 32:21.207
but I'm making it
your problem,

32:21.340 --> 32:23.409
so did you
see the two people
I'm looking for?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.111
A simple yes or no
will suffice.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.745
Yeah.

32:26.878 --> 32:29.115
And you handed them off
to another runner, correct?

32:29.248 --> 32:31.583
Again, yes or no
would be fine.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.052
No.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.956
Last chance.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.191
Tell him.
I am telling him.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.759
We never made the hand-off.

32:40.892 --> 32:43.429
By the time we got there,
that agent was out cold.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.664
He'd been shot,
wasn't breathing right.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.399
You didn't take him
to a hospital.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.600
If you did, we'd know.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.736
It's not a hospital.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.904
Not a real one, anyway.

32:53.039 --> 32:54.406
I got Agents Mojtabai and Park

32:54.540 --> 32:56.408
standing by
in the Seventh Ward.

32:56.542 --> 32:57.809
Good, because
I've got a location.

32:57.943 --> 33:00.579
Elizabeth and Donald
were taken to
the Shanghai Palace,

33:00.712 --> 33:02.248
a restaurant at
Weston and Grand.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.982
Dembe and I
are headed there now.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.984
A restaurant?
I don't have
good news, Harold.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.153
Apparently Donald
had to be taken

33:07.286 --> 33:08.787
to an
underground surgeon

33:08.920 --> 33:10.622
because there wasn't enough
time to get him to a hospital.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.224
And you don't know
his condition?

33:12.358 --> 33:14.426
No.
What about Elizabeth?

33:14.560 --> 33:15.794
I don't know.
We're on our way.

33:15.927 --> 33:16.928
Call an ambulance

33:17.063 --> 33:18.430
and tell Aram
and Agent Park
to hurry.

33:20.966 --> 33:24.436
So, you're what
all the fuss is about.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.505
Elizabeth Keen.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.607
And you're Bino?

33:30.109 --> 33:31.743
I'm confused.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.812
Reddington said
you were a friend.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.614
Reddington
has no friends.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.516
Your people
are helping us.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.486
Only because Reddington
withheld the truth.

33:40.619 --> 33:44.490
He never told me
you were running
from Neville Townsend.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.358
Get her out of here.
Take her back to The Castle.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.360
Wait. Wait,
Townsend doesn't know
you're helping me.

33:48.494 --> 33:49.961
You don't know that.
He may.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.064
Which is why
now my best option

33:52.198 --> 33:53.632
is to turn you over
and apologize.

33:53.765 --> 33:56.034
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Listen, okay?

33:56.168 --> 33:58.170
We're in the
same boat, Bino.

33:58.304 --> 34:01.307
Your life is at risk
because Reddington
withheld information.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.041
Believe me,
I understand that

34:03.175 --> 34:05.444
more than anybody
on this planet.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.646
Take her.
Townsend doesn't
even care about me.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.348
The only reason
he wants me dead

34:09.481 --> 34:10.616
is to get back at Reddington

34:10.749 --> 34:12.618
for something he did
a long time ago.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.153
What?
I don't know.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.487
What I do know is...

34:17.623 --> 34:20.259
If you want to make peace
with Townsend,

34:20.392 --> 34:22.494
you're not gonna do it
by turning me over to him.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.198
You're gonna do it
by killing Reddington.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.368
So let me guess.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.670
You'd like to
help me do that?

34:31.803 --> 34:35.507
Bino, I can't think of
anything I'd like more.

34:39.010 --> 34:39.745
Put her in the car.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.515
No. No! No!

34:43.649 --> 34:44.550
Ressler!

34:45.617 --> 34:46.518
You.

34:48.019 --> 34:49.855
That man never wakes up.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.423
Hmm?

34:51.557 --> 34:52.691
Whatever you did,

34:52.824 --> 34:53.792
undo it and get rid of him.

Hello?

35:59.057 --> 36:00.125
Elizabeth. Is she there?

36:00.259 --> 36:01.360
No.

Uh, but Agent Ressler
is here.

Uh, he's injured,
but EMTs are on site.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.566

36:07.699 --> 36:08.967
No, we don't know
where she is,

36:09.100 --> 36:11.670
but, uh, Ressler said
something about a castle?

36:12.704 --> 36:14.005
Does that mean
anything to you?

36:14.139 --> 36:15.341
I can look into it.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.508
Tell Donald to
stay in the light.

I'll call you
when we know more.

TOWNSEND: (OVER PHONE)
I understand. You did
the right thing by calling.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.486
I hope
you'll accept my apology.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.788
Reddington
intentionally misled me.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.890
Of course I'd never
agree to intervene

36:32.023 --> 36:33.158
if I'd known
you were involved.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.793

are in the Ward?

This is something that
I'm handling personally.

You own a chess club.

I'm the pawn,

me up for the slaughter.

It's a gambit.

37:51.537 --> 37:52.704
You know that term?

37:52.838 --> 37:56.742
It's when a player
sacrifices a piece

in order to gain
a positional advantage
later in the match.

38:00.412 --> 38:01.913

We're talking about
Neville Townsend,

38:09.688 --> 38:11.289
the one man
powerful enough

38:11.423 --> 38:14.292
to make Raymond Reddington
think twice.

38:15.594 --> 38:16.928
Look around.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.798
I may be small time,
but that does not mean

38:19.931 --> 38:22.368
that I don't have
big-time aspirations.

A man like Neville Townsend

38:24.403 --> 38:25.537
snaps his fingers

38:25.671 --> 38:27.439
and my life changes.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.508
Or it ends completely.

38:29.641 --> 38:33.512
Like I said,
a calculated risk.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.414
And all things considered,

38:35.547 --> 38:37.449
I like my chances.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.684
You don't know him.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.686
I do.

38:40.819 --> 38:44.089
Apparently, you're
really important to him.

38:44.222 --> 38:47.959
So important that
he came to take care
of you in person.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.928
It seems to me that
he'd be very grateful

to a guy like me
for making it easy.

seem uncalled for.
