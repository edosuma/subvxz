00:01.483 --> 00:02.683
Hi, I'm gonna be your waitress

00:02.684 --> 00:04.451
'cause my mother drank.

00:05.983 --> 00:07.201
We need a sec.

00:07.203 --> 00:10.204
Feelin' kinda generous, take two.

00:10.206 --> 00:13.307
Then he said to me,
"Dude, your vagina is weird."

00:13.309 --> 00:14.541
Dude, that's insane.

00:14.543 --> 00:15.576
It is so not weird.

00:15.578 --> 00:17.311
Your vagina's awesome.

00:17.313 --> 00:18.679
Okay, I'm ready.

00:18.681 --> 00:21.181
Now I need a sec.

00:21.183 --> 00:22.449
Well, it's over.

00:22.451 --> 00:23.817
I can't say it any more.

00:23.819 --> 00:25.519
The vagina's gone mainstream.

00:25.521 --> 00:29.356
What's next?
A clothing line at target?

00:29.358 --> 00:30.791
Aw, Max, I'm sorry.

00:30.793 --> 00:32.326
It's your favorite word.

00:32.328 --> 00:34.061
And my favorite body part.

00:34.063 --> 00:35.429
But now everyone's saying it.

00:35.431 --> 00:36.991
Well, we can
pick another word for it.

00:36.992 --> 00:39.099
Something cute, like cookie.

00:39.101 --> 00:40.734
Yeah, it sounds like a good idea

00:40.736 --> 00:42.503
until you walk past
a bunch of girl scouts

00:42.505 --> 00:45.472
selling their cookies on the street.

00:45.474 --> 00:46.794
Well, we've gotta pick something,

00:46.795 --> 00:48.575
'cause vagina's everywhere.

00:48.577 --> 00:50.644

This is invitation to
Metropolitan Museum Annual Gala.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.033
We have the invitation.
She'll be there.

01:16.035 --> 01:18.970
You are talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart.

01:18.972 --> 01:22.406
So you want me to taste your
cupcake in the ladies' room?

01:22.408 --> 01:24.475
What's inappropriate about that?

01:24.477 --> 01:26.077
That is our beer batter

01:26.079 --> 01:28.146
maple bacon spring break cupcake.

01:28.148 --> 01:29.480
Quite tasty.

01:29.482 --> 01:31.048
Do you girls have a card?

01:31.050 --> 01:32.884
Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

01:36.021 --> 01:37.955
Max, have you seen my phone?

01:37.957 --> 01:39.517
I wanna take a picture
of this bad tip

01:39.518 --> 01:40.825
and put it on Instagram.

01:40.827 --> 01:42.794
Getting loose change
used to be so depressing,

01:42.796 --> 01:44.996
but now I can
share it with strangers.

01:44.998 --> 01:46.497
Let me sum it up.

01:46.499 --> 01:47.832
Twitter is stupid.

01:47.834 --> 01:50.902
And Instagram is Twitter
for people who can't read.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.171
Where is my phone?

01:53.173 --> 01:54.733
I could've sworn
I left it right here,

01:54.734 --> 01:55.873
next to yours.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.141
I'll just call it.

01:57.143 --> 01:58.643
That's not necessary.

01:58.645 --> 01:59.977
I'm sure it'll turn up...

Max, why are you
hiding my phone in your apron?

02:08.221 --> 02:10.288
Is that the big question, really?

02:10.289 --> 02:11.889
'Cause I think
the bigger question is,

02:11.891 --> 02:13.357
why is your ringtone "My milkshake

02:13.359 --> 02:16.160
brings all the boys to the yard"?

02:16.162 --> 02:17.762
If you have to ask that,

02:17.764 --> 02:20.631
you clearly have not
seen my milkshake.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.068
Okay, here.
I'm busted.

02:24.070 --> 02:26.604
I was checking to see
if Martha Stewart called us yet.

02:26.606 --> 02:27.839
You checked it again?

02:27.841 --> 02:29.373
You check it, like, every 15 minutes.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.474
I know!

02:30.476 --> 02:32.677
I am acting like a little bitch.

02:32.679 --> 02:35.246
Max, Martha Stewart
has our business card.

02:35.248 --> 02:37.215
She liked our cupcakes.
She'll call.

02:37.217 --> 02:40.017
Look, in my defense,
she asked for our card.

02:40.019 --> 02:41.299
She got us all hot and bothered.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.020
And then what?
Nothing.

02:43.022 --> 02:45.756
Martha Stewart is cake tease.

02:47.994 --> 02:49.093
How dare you!

02:49.095 --> 02:51.229
Martha Stewart is not a cake tease.

02:51.231 --> 02:52.763
Nothing worse than a cake tease.

02:52.765 --> 02:54.799
Ask any man.

02:54.801 --> 02:57.735
Yeah, you shower,
you powder your sack.

02:57.737 --> 02:59.971
For what?

03:01.573 --> 03:03.007
Look, Max, relax.

03:03.009 --> 03:05.109
She'll call.
Everything's gonna work out.

03:05.111 --> 03:06.711
I mean, a year ago,
we didn't even have

03:06.712 --> 03:07.645
a cupcake business.

03:07.647 --> 03:09.113
Look how far we've come.

03:09.115 --> 03:10.514
I haven't come at all,

03:10.516 --> 03:13.584
thanks to the cake tease.

03:15.554 --> 03:18.890
Your cupcake is quite tasty.

03:18.892 --> 03:20.224
Do you have a card?

03:20.226 --> 03:22.393
Max, that's a good Martha Stewart.

03:22.395 --> 03:23.794
I know, 'cause I can't

03:23.796 --> 03:26.530
get her siren voice out of my head.

03:29.636 --> 03:32.637
Wow, Han.

03:32.639 --> 03:34.405
You look you were hit by a Mardi Gras

03:34.407 --> 03:36.641
and a Gay Pride float.

03:36.643 --> 03:39.043
I have just returned
from the exciting

03:39.045 --> 03:40.778
Manhattan Restaurant Trade Show.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.513
Look at all this free swag.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.415
And I've got stress balls.

03:44.417 --> 03:47.485
Well, just go in the back
and take care of yourself.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.187
Listen up, everybody.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.455
I have a big announcement.

03:51.457 --> 03:54.825
"- Well, more like
a 5'1" announcement.

03:54.827 --> 03:56.961
I am changing the diner
to state-of-the-art

03:56.963 --> 03:59.030
computer "power touch"
ordering system

03:59.032 --> 04:00.364
for food and checks.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.966
I am not learning anything new.

04:01.968 --> 04:05.002
I work here because I have no skills.

04:06.004 --> 04:07.405
You don't have to learn it, Max.

04:07.407 --> 04:08.873
It's very smart machine.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.808
- It will help you.
- -huh.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.877
That's how it started
with machines in <i>The Matrix.</i>

04:12.879 --> 04:15.479
Next thing you know,
the human race was enslaved.

04:15.481 --> 04:16.846
Been there, done that.

04:16.849 --> 04:19.617
I'm with Max.

04:19.619 --> 04:20.785
We are doing it.

04:20.786 --> 04:22.453
It's important to move the business

04:22.455 --> 04:23.754
into the future.

04:23.756 --> 04:27.058
So get with it, you luddites.

04:27.060 --> 04:30.061
girls, we got big trouble.

04:30.063 --> 04:32.129
If he starts using a new system,

04:32.131 --> 04:34.098
I won't be able to use my old system

04:34.100 --> 04:36.748
where I skim something off the top.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.483
Earl, skimming?

04:38.485 --> 04:39.885
I'm kind of shocked.

04:39.887 --> 04:41.320
I don't do it for me.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.854
You know how once a month you girls

04:42.856 --> 04:44.914
have really good night in tips?

04:44.916 --> 04:46.850
You're welcome.

04:46.852 --> 04:48.985
I have been lying awake at night

04:48.987 --> 04:50.920
trying to figure out
how we made that 200 bucks

04:50.922 --> 04:53.990
with her skills.

04:53.992 --> 04:55.992
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, Sophie.

04:55.994 --> 04:57.494
You know, every time I come here,

04:57.496 --> 05:00.430
Im 'surprised you're still open.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.401
Here you go, Sophie.

05:04.403 --> 05:06.069
Hey.

05:06.071 --> 05:07.470
Where's the little Asian woman

05:07.472 --> 05:09.773
that always hands me my menu?

05:10.275 --> 05:12.214
Asian woman?
You mean Han?

05:12.226 --> 05:13.343
Mm-hm.

05:13.345 --> 05:15.111
Sophie, Han's a man.

05:15.113 --> 05:18.047
If you say so.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.618
Is there anything special tonight?

05:22.120 --> 05:23.186
Yes.

05:23.188 --> 05:25.622
Here I am...

05:25.624 --> 05:28.591
With treats for my sweet.

05:28.593 --> 05:30.093
Aww.

05:30.095 --> 05:31.928
Day-glo zebra?

05:31.930 --> 05:34.431
That's my favorite animal.

05:36.133 --> 05:39.035
And edible underwear!

05:39.037 --> 05:42.705
That's my favorite snack.

05:42.707 --> 05:46.376
Yeah, and they're crotchless,
so less carbs.

05:48.979 --> 05:53.183
And my favorite
microwavable lube.

05:54.652 --> 05:57.554
And what's this?

05:57.556 --> 06:00.056
Toothbrushes?

06:00.058 --> 06:03.693
That's going to hurt you,
but okay.

06:05.162 --> 06:07.130
No, I want to leave them
at your house,

06:07.132 --> 06:08.965
now that you and I are exclusive.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.670
Exclusive?

06:13.672 --> 06:16.005
Wait, hold phone.

06:16.007 --> 06:17.841
Are you telling me that you and I

06:17.843 --> 06:19.342
are not exclusive?

06:19.344 --> 06:21.110
Exclusive?

06:21.112 --> 06:22.679
Come on.

06:22.681 --> 06:25.114
Stop it now.
Go on Jay Leno.

06:27.018 --> 06:30.487
Caroline, did you think
Sophie and I were exclusive?

06:30.489 --> 06:33.456
Well, you have stopped
showing us your penis.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.325
Exactly!

06:35.327 --> 06:37.794
If that's not exclusive,
I don't know what is.

06:37.796 --> 06:39.762
Exclusive!

06:39.764 --> 06:41.564
My God.

06:41.566 --> 06:45.168
Come on, stop it, before I...

06:47.973 --> 06:49.405
It happened.

06:49.407 --> 06:51.841
I split my spanx.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.074

07:01.373 --> 07:03.107

07:03.859 --> 07:06.527
It's Michelle Obama.

07:06.529 --> 07:07.995
What's this about?

07:07.997 --> 07:12.100
My sheets shrunk and I am pissed.

07:12.402 --> 07:13.935
Hello?

07:13.937 --> 07:16.304
Max, it didn't work
when you were Mick Jagger

07:16.306 --> 07:18.172
with a busted muffin tin,

07:18.174 --> 07:21.709
or Alicia keys
with a wonky shower curtain.

07:21.711 --> 07:23.611
And it really didn't work
when you were

07:23.613 --> 07:25.146
Steve Jobs back from the dead

07:25.148 --> 07:28.082
with thoughts on her panini press.

07:28.084 --> 07:29.851
Stop sober dialing Martha Stewart!

07:29.853 --> 07:31.986
Who says I'm sober?

I'm over her.

07:44.434 --> 07:46.367
When is she gonna call me?

07:46.369 --> 07:49.270
My milkshake would totally
bring her to the yard.

07:49.272 --> 07:51.606
Max, this isn't you.

07:51.608 --> 07:52.740
I mean, you're strong.

07:52.742 --> 07:54.108
You're a badass.

07:54.110 --> 07:56.777
You beat H.P.V.
With Tylenol.

07:56.779 --> 07:59.146
And it wasn't even the name brand.

07:59.148 --> 08:00.681
What's wrong with you?

08:00.683 --> 08:02.750
I was a virgin before Martha, okay?

08:02.752 --> 08:05.253
No one ever told me I was good
at anything before her.

08:05.255 --> 08:07.755
And you never forget
your first rich white woman.

08:07.757 --> 08:09.590
With or without Martha Stewart,

08:09.592 --> 08:11.158
we're gonna build
our cupcake business

08:11.160 --> 08:12.693
and be a success, I just know it.

08:12.695 --> 08:14.462
How?
How do you know that?

08:14.464 --> 08:16.531
I know because you have the talent,

08:16.533 --> 08:18.666
I have the vision,
and because I feel it.

08:18.668 --> 08:20.034
I feel it here.

08:20.036 --> 08:22.537
Blegh!
Your heart?

08:22.539 --> 08:25.706
No. My pearls...
my lucky pearls.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.543
By lucky, do you mean ugly?

08:28.545 --> 08:29.810
I've worn these every day

08:29.812 --> 08:31.479
since I was evicted
from my townhouse.

08:31.481 --> 08:33.614
This pearl necklace brings me luck.

08:33.616 --> 08:35.116
You...

08:35.118 --> 08:37.251
you think your life is lucky?

08:37.253 --> 08:41.222
This morning you used toilet
paper as a coffee filter...

08:41.224 --> 08:44.926
And then used it as toilet paper.

08:44.928 --> 08:47.094
I know this sounds silly to you,

08:47.096 --> 08:48.329
but there is something about

08:48.331 --> 08:49.730
putting on these pearls every day

08:49.732 --> 08:52.033
that makes me feel strong, confident,

08:52.035 --> 08:53.868
and like anything is possible.

08:53.870 --> 08:57.338
And as long as I have these lucky...

08:59.775 --> 09:02.510
No.
No!

09:02.512 --> 09:03.644
No, no, no, don't freak out.

09:03.646 --> 09:04.966
Don't freak out.
We'll get them.

09:08.318 --> 09:09.417
My pearls!

09:09.419 --> 09:10.885
My lucky pearls!

09:10.887 --> 09:12.987
Yes, yes, we have
identified the problem.

09:12.989 --> 09:15.056
Just pick them up.

09:22.931 --> 09:25.232
Whoa! Looks like
somebody found breakfast.

09:25.234 --> 09:27.568
No, Chestnut!

09:28.905 --> 09:30.671
I'm still using that.

09:30.673 --> 09:32.773
Well, nothing's gonna work out now.

09:32.775 --> 09:34.075
Here comes the bad luck.

09:34.077 --> 09:35.242
Don't be ridiculous.

09:35.244 --> 09:38.079
Your luck couldn't get any worse.

09:39.982 --> 09:42.049
Aah!

09:45.922 --> 09:47.955
Or could it?

09:53.195 --> 09:54.295
Okay, Earl.

09:54.297 --> 09:57.431
This is the L-520
Order System touch pad.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.767
Look how simple.
See?

09:59.769 --> 10:01.068
I'm telling you,

10:01.070 --> 10:03.537
I can't figure this
tricky little thing out.

10:03.539 --> 10:05.906
Earl, it's an on/off button.

10:05.908 --> 10:07.308
Slow down.

10:07.310 --> 10:10.277
It does both?

10:10.279 --> 10:13.347
Let me just charge this up
for you right here.

10:16.753 --> 10:17.852
This thing has been plugged

10:17.854 --> 10:20.688
more than the Kardashian sisters.

10:22.057 --> 10:24.859
I better check the old wiring
in diner first.

10:24.861 --> 10:27.294
Max, now I feel like
everyone's staring

10:27.296 --> 10:28.696
at my chest area.

10:28.698 --> 10:29.897
Well, welcome to my life,

10:29.899 --> 10:32.033
every day since I was nine.

10:32.035 --> 10:34.468
That necklace
meant something special to me.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.404
Didn't you ever
lose anything sentimental

10:36.406 --> 10:37.905
you had for a long time?

10:37.907 --> 10:40.875
My mother, but then
she found her way back.

10:40.877 --> 10:43.577
Look, I am done waiting
for Martha to call.

10:43.579 --> 10:45.780
I say we go down there
with some cupcakes,

10:45.781 --> 10:47.181
remind her how much she liked them,

10:47.183 --> 10:49.050
and suggest she puts us on her show.

10:49.052 --> 10:51.452
No, I mean, I can't go
without my pearls.

10:51.454 --> 10:53.421
And it's more than just the luck.

10:53.423 --> 10:55.890
It's who I was
before I lost everything.

10:55.892 --> 10:57.124
You know how I always say,

10:57.126 --> 10:58.759
"hi, I'm Caroline Channing,"

10:58.761 --> 11:00.194
and then touch my pearls?

11:00.196 --> 11:01.762
I'm not just introducing myself.

11:01.764 --> 11:03.164
I'm reminding myself.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.700
Well, let me remind you
of something else.

11:05.702 --> 11:07.034
Yesterday you told me

11:07.036 --> 11:09.270
we were going
to rule the world with cupcakes.

11:09.272 --> 11:11.405
Yeah, that was the pearls talking.

11:11.407 --> 11:13.407
Okay, well, now I'm talking.

11:13.409 --> 11:14.675
There is no luck.

11:14.677 --> 11:15.976
There is only work.

11:15.978 --> 11:18.012
And right now,
you're working my last nerve.

11:18.014 --> 11:20.081
So I am going down there myself.

11:20.083 --> 11:21.682
And if Martha won't help me,

11:21.684 --> 11:23.517
I'ma bust her kneecaps
with a rolling pin

11:23.519 --> 11:26.587
and then say,
"Now <i>that's</i> a good thing."

11:34.143 --> 11:35.903
Okay, what if we just
send Martha an email,

11:35.904 --> 11:37.584
so we're not just
standing in her office,

11:37.585 --> 11:38.625
begging some receptionist?

11:38.626 --> 11:40.481
- That won't do anything.
- Yes, it will.

11:40.483 --> 11:42.150
I craft amazing business emails.

11:42.152 --> 11:43.584
I went to Wharton.

11:43.586 --> 11:46.187
Please don't, Max.
That's all I have left.

11:46.189 --> 11:48.589
Max, Caroline, I found something

11:48.591 --> 11:49.857
at the restaurant trade show

11:49.859 --> 11:51.259
you might be interested in.

11:51.261 --> 11:53.027
The only restaurant trade
I'm interested in

11:53.029 --> 11:56.364
is if we can exchange you
for anybody else.

11:56.366 --> 11:58.699
You won't be laughing in a minute.

11:58.701 --> 12:00.201
Look, it's a cupcake from the new

12:00.203 --> 12:02.570
state-of-the-art
cupcake ATM machine.

12:02.572 --> 12:04.806
Sprinkles cupcakes
plans to be put them everywhere.

12:04.808 --> 12:07.675
Soon, everyone will be able
to just push a button,

12:07.677 --> 12:10.078
day or night, and get the cupcake.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.447
So, I guess what I'm saying is,

12:12.449 --> 12:14.382
you might be screwed.

12:16.385 --> 12:18.519
Delicious...

12:18.521 --> 12:20.888
And no attitude.

12:23.358 --> 12:24.859
Well, more bad luck.

12:24.861 --> 12:25.993
I thought you were kidding,

12:25.995 --> 12:27.562
but the machines are taking over.

12:27.564 --> 12:28.796
We can't compete with that.

12:28.798 --> 12:30.631
The business is done.
Game over.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.317
Man, you are never
gonna make it in the future.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.119
This is where the humans fight.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.121
This is where we march down
to Martha Stewart

12:37.123 --> 12:38.456
and demand a damn blurb,

12:38.458 --> 12:40.191
so we can compete
with the machines...

12:40.193 --> 12:44.128
Just like in "Terminator 2:
Rise of the desserts."

12:44.130 --> 12:45.930
Fine.
Let's go see Martha.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.031
She's our only hope.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.199
My lucky necklace is gone.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.268
We can no longer
just wait for magic to happen.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.602
Thank you, by the way,

12:51.604 --> 12:54.171
for never telling me
that our former plan was magic.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.944
We'll just reintroduce
ourselves and our cupcakes

12:59.946 --> 13:01.626
to Martha and impress her
all over again,

13:01.627 --> 13:03.547
even though I'm wearing
a necklace that I hate.

13:03.548 --> 13:05.516
It's limp, anemic, and lackluster.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.152
I have an Olsen twin around my neck.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.687
Here.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.155
What are you doing?

13:11.157 --> 13:14.659
So Martha will recognize me.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.260
Hi, excuse me.
Two questions.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.582
Which floor is Martha Stewart on?

13:17.583 --> 13:20.531
And should I lose this necklace?

13:20.533 --> 13:23.100
Well, your silence speaks volumes.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.623
Hi, I'm not crazy,

13:24.624 --> 13:26.304
so you can just
tell me the floor number.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.339
Elevator right over there,
15th floor,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.007
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.810
Just got a little damp.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.180
Thanks for your help.
Feels better.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.615
Smart, getting necklace advice

13:37.617 --> 13:38.949
from a guy with no neck.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.018
Wait. Is that...

13:41.020 --> 13:43.821
That's the cupcake machine
that Han was talking about.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.523
No!

13:45.525 --> 13:46.991
I was hoping it'd be ugly,

13:46.993 --> 13:49.327
but it's pink and really cute.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.596
It's like a gay R2-D2.

13:52.598 --> 13:55.766
Well, a gayer R2-D2.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.569
Who wouldn't want
a cupcake from this?

13:58.571 --> 14:01.072
No one.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.506
- We have to mess her up.
- What?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.875
Why are you carrying
spray-paint in your purse?

14:04.877 --> 14:06.744
For the same reason I carry a tampon.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.279
'Cause you never know.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.781
We are not gonna destroy
someone else's property.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.583
Well, we have to do something,

14:12.585 --> 14:14.352
'cause it's that machine or us.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.653
I know.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.023
We can open the little door
and put a poop in it.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.858
Not one of mine.
Jeez!

14:20.860 --> 14:22.626
What am I, a pig?

14:22.628 --> 14:25.129
Well, I'm not doing it.

14:25.131 --> 14:28.466
No, we just get some
puppy poop from the street.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.567
No!

14:29.569 --> 14:31.602
We are not that desperate.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.704
And I'm out of wetnaps.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.907
No, see, we already met Martha.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.642
We're just stopping by to say hi.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.044
You've already met Martha.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.846
You're just stopping by to say hi.

14:41.848 --> 14:42.980
Yes.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.482
Martha Stewart asked us for our card.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.184
Martha Stewart
asked you for your card.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.619
And where should I tell Martha

14:48.621 --> 14:49.887
she asked for your card?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.322
In the ladies' room.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.090
Martha Stewart
asked you for your card

14:53.092 --> 14:54.959
- in the ladies' room.
- Okay.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.061
Don't make it sound like that.
It happened.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.783
We cornered her
in the ladies' room and...

14:58.784 --> 15:00.544
Okay, don't make it
sound like that either.

15:00.545 --> 15:02.547
We went to a gala on the off chance

15:02.548 --> 15:03.868
that she would be gracious enough

15:03.869 --> 15:05.469
to try one of our cupcakes
and she did.

15:05.470 --> 15:06.370
She was very gracious.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.139
Yeah, maybe cornered
was the wrong word.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.007
It's not like we went there
to hunt her down.

15:10.009 --> 15:13.077
It's not like you went there
to hunt her down.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.745
It's not.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.147
Okay, I hear your tone.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.848
I see what's going down here.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.517
You think I'm some kind of a problem.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.253
Well, for the record,
Martha came on to me.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.988
All right. Okay.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.323
This is not going as well
as we had hoped.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.692
Don't know how it could
without my magic pearls.

15:28.694 --> 15:29.994
Okay, look.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.796
I get that you're not
gonna let us up there.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.518
And I don't blame you,
what, with this one

15:33.519 --> 15:34.632
talking about magic.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.534
But just so you know,
we are not lying.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.635
It happened.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.877
And after we hunted her down...

15:38.878 --> 15:40.838
because, yeah,
you got us on that, we did...

15:40.840 --> 15:42.273
Martha told us

15:42.275 --> 15:45.042
she liked our entrepreneurial drive.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.711
Well, that does sound like Martha.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.847
Okay, I'll send these up.
Have a seat.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.116
Thank you so much.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.851
And here, uh, please take one,

15:53.853 --> 15:55.186
just so you can see for yourself

15:55.188 --> 15:56.821
why Martha asked for our card.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.589
Well, I was gonna get a cupcake

15:58.591 --> 16:00.257
from that cute machine
downstairs later.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.525
Don't.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.487
I heard someone found
something nasty in that...

16:03.488 --> 16:04.295
In about an hour.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.529
Max.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.565
And this is our beer batter

16:07.567 --> 16:09.834
maple bacon spring break cupcake.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.068
Mmm.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.337
I can see why Martha...

16:13.339 --> 16:14.839
What the...

16:14.841 --> 16:16.340
I cracked my tooth!

16:16.342 --> 16:18.375
What?

16:18.377 --> 16:20.044
What is that?
Is it...

16:20.046 --> 16:21.145
is that glass?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.013
No, it's a pearl.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.715
I'm so sorry.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.817
Sorry?
You're sorry?

16:26.819 --> 16:30.287
I've been wearing Invisaligns
for 11 months!

16:32.691 --> 16:34.658
Well, there goes our big break.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.027
Never would've happened
if I had had my necklace.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.383
The one with the lucky pearls

16:38.384 --> 16:40.064
that broke into the batter
and that woman

16:40.066 --> 16:42.266
just spit into her hand
mixed with saliva and blood?

16:42.268 --> 16:44.635
That lucky necklace?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.537
Yes.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.072
Might as well face it.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.523
You and I are on our own.

16:49.525 --> 16:51.085
And not just
because of Martha either.

16:51.086 --> 16:53.394
Because there
is no such thing as good luck.

16:53.396 --> 16:54.829
Never seen it.

16:54.831 --> 16:56.764
And all lucky charms are stupid,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.566
except for <i>the</i> lucky charms,

16:58.568 --> 17:01.135
which are magically delicious.

17:04.374 --> 17:05.539
Look at it over there.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.342
Gay R2-D2
just laughing at us.

17:08.344 --> 17:09.443
You were right, Max.

17:09.444 --> 17:10.645
You and I are on our own.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.546
We're just a little
start-up cupcake company

17:12.548 --> 17:14.248
in a hard, hard world.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.651
And we gotta take matters
into our own hands.

17:16.653 --> 17:18.118
Cover me.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.453
Wait, wait, no.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.988
No, don't do it now.

17:20.990 --> 17:22.589
- The guard is right there.
- Hey, you!

17:22.590 --> 17:23.723
Stop that!

17:23.726 --> 17:25.566
What kind of freaks
deface a cupcake machine?

17:25.567 --> 17:26.426
Run, run run!

17:29.831 --> 17:33.200
Okay, stop, stop, stop.
We lost him.

17:33.202 --> 17:35.069
You know you only
tagged the wall, right?

17:35.071 --> 17:36.837
Yes, I have no luck.

17:36.839 --> 17:39.373
No one has any luck...

17:39.375 --> 17:42.943
With the possible exception
of Lindsay Lohan's lawyer.

17:44.464 --> 17:45.830
Look, it's Martha!

17:45.832 --> 17:47.865
She's getting in that car.
Give me the cupcakes.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.307
I'm going after her before she talks

17:49.308 --> 17:52.002
to that lady whose mouth we broke.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.839
Max, don't jiggle the cupcakes!

17:54.841 --> 17:56.207
Aah!

17:59.078 --> 18:00.878
My God. My God.
My God.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.979
Max, are you all right?

18:01.981 --> 18:03.347
Are you all right?

18:03.349 --> 18:05.449
I'm fine.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.384
No broken bones,

18:07.386 --> 18:09.286
which is surprising,
because when I was kid,

18:09.288 --> 18:10.821
we couldn't afford milk.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.690
Actually the only time
my mother bought milk

18:12.692 --> 18:14.725
was when my face
was on the side of the carton.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.994
Are you sure you're all right?

18:16.996 --> 18:18.762
Yeah.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.332
I guess there
is such a thing as luck.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.003
And tomorrow night

18:26.005 --> 18:27.872
when you come in for takeout, Sophie,

18:27.874 --> 18:30.241
all Max has to do
is hit this little thing.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.176
Well, if I'm allowed
to hit little things,

18:32.178 --> 18:33.644
you're next.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.647
Change makes everyone so tense.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.651
Kitchen is now closed.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.986
I have plans.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.488
Big plans.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.702
Sophie, I understand

18:50.703 --> 18:52.463
your relationship with Oleg
is complicated,

18:52.465 --> 18:53.964
so let's simplify it.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.726
Are you having sex
in our building tonight,

18:55.727 --> 18:57.535
and do I have to wear earplugs?

18:57.537 --> 18:59.603
I will be alone...

18:59.605 --> 19:01.939
But wear them anyway.

19:04.442 --> 19:06.176
Hi, um, sorry, we're closed.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.311
I do not wish to eat.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.580
I just got collect call from Oleg.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.485
She said we are closed.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.620
And who are you?

19:16.622 --> 19:18.756
I'm the last person you will see

19:18.758 --> 19:21.492
before you learn how to walk again.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.829
Stay away from Oleg,

19:25.831 --> 19:28.699
or I'll pull your intestines
out through your nose

19:28.701 --> 19:32.670
and give them to her
to wear as new necklace.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.871
Fine.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.039
I will leave.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.941
But only because
you have eyes of a python,

19:36.943 --> 19:39.043
and I have possible U.T.I.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.714
Sophie...

19:43.716 --> 19:46.550
Why don't you just admit it,
you and Oleg?

19:46.552 --> 19:47.785
What?

19:47.787 --> 19:49.520
It's not like I want him.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.522
It's just that where I come from,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.824
you never throw anything away.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.261
Here you go, ladies.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.964
Enjoy the extra tips
from your credit cards,

19:59.966 --> 20:02.299
because when Han flips that switch,

20:02.301 --> 20:04.101
the only tip I can give you is,

20:04.103 --> 20:06.270
don't wash your hair every day.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.639
It dries it out.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.575
Okay.
Here comes the future.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.311
One, two...

20:18.117 --> 20:21.185
This old building sucks me so hard.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.954
Congratulations, ladies.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.223
This is your lucky night.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.325
Speaking of luck,

20:28.327 --> 20:30.060
here are your pearls.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.062
I found most of them, but I think

20:32.064 --> 20:33.163
Chestnut ate a few.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.698
You can dig for those later yourself.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.066
Max.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.369
And it won't look the same,

20:37.370 --> 20:39.570
because you have to string them
on this cheap-ass wire

20:39.572 --> 20:41.639
I got at the hipster bead store...

20:41.641 --> 20:44.575
Beading Off.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.310
We can add this Earl bonus money

20:46.312 --> 20:47.578
to our cupcake business total.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.613
Yeah, that 150 will really put a dent

20:49.615 --> 20:51.548
in the 250,000 we need.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.650
We'll get there, Max.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.118
Because you and I have something

20:54.120 --> 20:56.020
Martha Stewart and machines don't.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.154
Unpaid bills?

20:57.156 --> 20:59.256
Mushrooms growing
on our bathroom rug?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.191
No, each other.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.193
Aww, a year later you're still

21:03.195 --> 21:06.096
trying to get me to feel things.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.418
Do you wanna know the real reason

21:07.419 --> 21:09.500
I thought this necklace was so lucky?

21:09.502 --> 21:12.936
I was wearing it the day I met you.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.471
So, I'm gonna have some extras

21:14.473 --> 21:16.040
do you wanna make one for yourself?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.875
Nah, I've had
plenty of pearl necklaces,

21:17.877 --> 21:20.878
and I find them
more sticky than lucky.

21:23.049 --> 21:26.483
Max,
ms@marthastewartinc.com.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.786
"Haven't forgotten about you, girls.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.287
Martha Stewart."

21:30.289 --> 21:32.056
Just when I thought I was out,

21:32.058 --> 21:34.992
she pulls me back in again.

21:36.262 --> 21:40.029
