WEBVTT

00:05.610 --> 00:07.580
Okay, Alex, change me back.

00:07.710 --> 00:10.150
Oh, but Daddy,
you look so cute as a goat.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.780
Let's make him eat a tin can.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.690
Not funny, Max. Alex, change me back.

00:16.820 --> 00:18.090
Okay, okay.

00:18.230 --> 00:20.390
Huminoza espinoza

00:25.230 --> 00:28.290
- We really got your goat, huh, Dad?
- Got your goat.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.800
That's it. You just laughed your way
into one hour of study hall, starting now.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.740
- Let's go.
- We didn't even...

00:33.870 --> 00:36.100
And that means
working on your wizard homework

00:36.240 --> 00:38.730
and not messing around.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.640
Who's laughing now, huh?

00:44.720 --> 00:47.810
There's something wrong with that spell.
Or maybe it's me.

00:47.950 --> 00:50.860
No, it's gotta be the spell. Okay.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.590
What are you doing
on the wizard computer?

00:55.730 --> 00:57.530
Yeah, we're supposed to be
doing our homework,

00:57.660 --> 01:00.190
not surfing the World Wide Wiz Web.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.600
l have to do a little shopping.

01:01.740 --> 01:04.230
l like to look good
when l'm doing my homework.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.700
Oh, this place
has the best no-trip high heels.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.610
No matter how high the heels are,
it's impossible to twist your ankle.

01:10.740 --> 01:11.940
l have to try some on.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.540
They were cuter on-screen.

01:19.950 --> 01:22.250
Oh, look, here's something for Justin.

01:24.420 --> 01:26.820
Check it out. Mini-dragons for sale.

01:27.230 --> 01:30.690
Okay, no. l'm getting out of here
because l don't wanna get involved.

01:32.230 --> 01:34.760
Oh, that is the cutest little dog
l've ever seen.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.490
Hey, boy.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.700
Not only is he cute,
but he's also a dragon.

01:41.110 --> 01:44.740
That's right,
a mythical creature and a dog combined.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.070
Now tell me, how many would you like?

01:48.250 --> 01:49.440
We're just looking.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.250
What would it take for me
to get you involved

01:53.390 --> 01:55.880
in one of these marvelous
little dragon-dogs today?

01:56.390 --> 01:59.020
l don't get it. ls it a dragon or is it a dog?

01:59.160 --> 02:01.920
lt was charmed to look like a dog
so it could exist in the real world.

02:02.060 --> 02:05.590
Now, beat it, kid.
l'm in the middle of a sale.

02:07.130 --> 02:08.759
Okay, how are we gonna have
a dragon-dog?

02:08.900 --> 02:10.560
Mom would totally freak out.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.170
Wait.

02:12.570 --> 02:17.340
lf you guys buy right now,
l will throw in a smoke detector,

02:17.480 --> 02:21.380
and a small device that cuts tomatoes.

02:21.780 --> 02:23.250
You mean, like a knife?

02:23.850 --> 02:25.320
Kid...

02:26.050 --> 02:29.040
Here's a roll of quarters.
Knock yourself out.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.020
- With what?
- The quarters.

02:33.490 --> 02:35.860
He seems friendly.
l bet you he's not much of a guard dog.

02:38.030 --> 02:40.470
- That is awesome.
- l like him. He's feisty.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.430
Dragon in a beagle suit,
what's the big deal?

02:43.640 --> 02:45.430
l'll tell you what the big deal is.

02:45.570 --> 02:48.700
This dog-dragon is on sale
for 5 million cubicks.

02:48.840 --> 02:53.040
And because you have a coupon--
Here, take that.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.040
--it's 20 percent off.

02:56.450 --> 02:58.510
Dude, you should totally get him.
He's on sale.

02:58.650 --> 03:01.640
Plus he'll throw in a ''tomato'' slicer.

03:01.790 --> 03:02.950
l'm sorry.

03:03.090 --> 03:05.680
l'm can't get another dog again.
No way.

03:05.830 --> 03:08.890
- Not after what happened with Willie.
- Wait, who's Willie?

03:09.030 --> 03:12.160
He's the dog we had
when you were a baby.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.530
Oh, no, here comes the tears.

03:13.670 --> 03:16.900
Or as Justin calls them, his ''allergies.''

03:19.240 --> 03:21.470
When l was 7, he got lost,

03:21.610 --> 03:24.510
and l swore
l'd never love another dog again.

03:25.610 --> 03:28.880
l gotta go.
My allergies are acting up, so...

03:31.280 --> 03:33.380
l'll take him.
Justin's gonna love me for this.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.010
But Justin just said
that he doesn't want a dog.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.490
- Trust me, Justin wants a dog.
- Trust her, Justin wants a dog.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.300
Here's 5 million cubicks in U.S. currency.
Oh, l know the exchange rate.

03:44.430 --> 03:47.200
l order from the Abercrombie and Witch
catalog all the time.

03:47.330 --> 03:48.560
Good.

03:48.700 --> 03:52.800
Your five-second warranty
just ended right now.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.300
Well, let's go find a cute doggie sweater
to match that cute doggie face.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.810
Come on. Come on, doggie.

04:06.150 --> 04:09.140
My dog burnt my homework.
That'll be a new one.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:09.920 --> 05:12.180
Justin, you're gonna love this.
Close your eyes.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.380
Okay, but l'm not gonna taste anything.

05:18.790 --> 05:19.950
Ta-da.

05:20.090 --> 05:23.530
Alex, what's that dragon-dog doing here?
l told you, l don't want another pet.

05:23.660 --> 05:25.930
Well, l think you do,
and so did the dragon seller.

05:26.070 --> 05:28.470
Of course he did, he's a dragon seller.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.540
And besides,
what are you gonna tell Mom and Dad?

05:30.670 --> 05:33.540
Mom and Dad don't have to know
he's a dragon. l'll say l found a dog.

05:33.670 --> 05:37.440
Because it's a dog and it looks like a dog,
that barks fire.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.310
Okay, l appreciate
what you're trying to do for me here,

05:40.450 --> 05:41.910
but l can't go down this path again.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.310
And besides,
you know about my allergies.

05:44.450 --> 05:45.880
lt's crying.

05:46.020 --> 05:48.210
l'm allergic to sadness.

05:48.660 --> 05:51.150
Look, l know losing Willie
broke your heart.

05:51.290 --> 05:54.190
But the truth is,
he didn't run away and get lost.

05:54.330 --> 05:56.820
He got out because...

05:58.130 --> 05:59.620
Because l kind of let him out.

06:00.570 --> 06:01.760
lt was you?

06:02.470 --> 06:04.800
Mom and Dad told me
it was the pizza delivery guy.

06:04.940 --> 06:07.370
l haven't eaten pizza in, like, eight years.

06:07.970 --> 06:09.270
Don't be mad. l was 5.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.900
l wanted to take Willie for a walk,
and he wanted to go for a run.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.010
You're saying you feel guilty?

06:15.150 --> 06:17.050
Rarely, but yes.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.250
All right.

06:19.390 --> 06:21.290
Hey, buddy.

06:21.690 --> 06:23.210
That's a good boy.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.920
Oh, he just did that thing
with his nose like Willie did.

06:27.060 --> 06:29.430
Do you like your new home, boy?

06:29.900 --> 06:31.450
He can nod.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.190
Thanks, Alex. He's awesome.

06:34.330 --> 06:37.000
- l love a good lunch rush.
- Me too.

06:37.140 --> 06:40.040
l just wish everyone
wouldn't show up at once.

06:40.170 --> 06:41.230
What's that?

06:42.040 --> 06:43.570
A dog. Just a dog.

06:45.310 --> 06:46.780
Yeah, what's it doing here?

06:46.910 --> 06:50.610
l found it wandering alone
in Waverly Place.

06:50.750 --> 06:54.080
Lonely, looking for a home.
Looking for a half-Latino family.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.280
lt's destiny. We have to keep him.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.690
Hey, buddy. How you doing, boy?

07:02.830 --> 07:06.420
- Good boy. Speak.
- No, don't speak. Don't speak.

07:06.570 --> 07:09.300
- Why not?
- Because if he speaks, there'll be fire.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.060
- What?
- What?

07:11.200 --> 07:12.360
What Max is trying to say,

07:12.510 --> 07:16.000
is that he's saving his voice
for those barking-dog albums.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.270
He does a mean Bon Jovi.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.740
Well, see, he's multi-talented.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.410
l think we should keep him, Theresa.

07:23.550 --> 07:25.380
Oh, we can't keep a lost dog.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.710
Someone's probably out of their mind
looking for him.

07:27.850 --> 07:30.450
Oh, that is so true. You're right, Mom.

07:30.590 --> 07:32.580
And we should probably
put fliers up in the city

07:32.730 --> 07:34.220
so we can find its rightful owner.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.160
Really? But he's so cute.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.760
Come on, Alex.
You pick now to be responsible?

07:39.900 --> 07:43.390
Absolutely.
We'll scour the city for the owner.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.560
And on the off chance
that we come up short,

07:45.710 --> 07:47.540
only then can we keep the dog.

07:48.710 --> 07:51.470
That's very mature, Alex.
l'm proud of you.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.440
Oh, so that's been your plan
all along, huh?

07:54.580 --> 07:56.410
Play with my fragile heart
and then crush it?

07:56.550 --> 07:58.520
What happens
if the rightful dog owner comes along

07:58.650 --> 07:59.910
and sees the lost-dog sign?

08:00.050 --> 08:02.390
No one's gonna claim it,
because it's not lost or a dog.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.490
And you're the smart one?

08:04.990 --> 08:06.050
You're right. l'm sorry.

08:06.190 --> 08:08.960
l'm just a little panicked
over what happened with Willie.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.860
Let it go. l was 5.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.660
As long as he's here,
what should we call it?

08:14.800 --> 08:17.270
Oh, l know, here's an idea. Spot.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.670
No, wait, Paws.

08:19.810 --> 08:21.300
Patches.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.870
l think we should call it Dragon.

08:24.010 --> 08:27.570
- What? Why would we call it that?
- Yeah, why?

08:27.710 --> 08:29.380
Because it's a dragon.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.310
l swear l didn't say anything.

08:31.450 --> 08:34.820
lts name is right here on its tag.
lts name is Dragon.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.650
The name Dragon is on its tag.

08:38.789 --> 08:40.280
l love the name Dragon.
Good eye, Mom.

08:40.429 --> 08:41.590
lt's like it was meant to be.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.960
Okay,
let's talk about something else now.

08:53.510 --> 08:56.530
Hey, Charlie, can l hang one of these
found-dog signs on your stand?

08:56.680 --> 08:58.670
What's in it for me, sweetheart?

08:59.410 --> 09:00.500
Where's Charlie?

09:00.650 --> 09:04.840
Let's just say Charlie went to the bank
to get the candy he owes me.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.810
And by ''candy,'' l mean money.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.490
Yeah, l kind of figured that
when you said ''bank.''

09:10.620 --> 09:12.350
Can l hang one of these signs
on your stand?

09:12.490 --> 09:14.480
l'll give you a Bronxstrami Swiss on rye.

09:14.630 --> 09:18.930
How about a Bronxstrami Swiss
and a kiss?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.760
How about a Bronxstrami Swiss
and a bowl of soup?

09:21.900 --> 09:25.130
Cup of soup, foot-long,
no cheaping out on the cheese.

09:25.270 --> 09:26.900
And a meaningful hug.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.630
No hug. Done.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.210
You'll come around. They always do.

09:32.110 --> 09:35.170
Well, l don't know who they are,
but l'm not one of them.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.480
He's just like Willie.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.650
He likes dog treats,
squeak toys and toilet water.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.120
He ate a squeak toy.
That's okay, Dragon. You're still the best.

09:46.260 --> 09:49.320
Oh, let me get a picture of you, boy. Sit.

09:50.200 --> 09:54.060
This will go great in the activities chapter
of the photo album l'm putting together.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.000
Cute pup. What's his name?

09:56.140 --> 09:57.330
Dragon.

09:57.470 --> 09:59.060
Not because he is a dragon.

09:59.210 --> 10:01.900
No, because there's no such thing
as dragons.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.800
l should stop talking.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.070
- Does he fetch?
- No, he doesn't fetch.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.510
- You probably don't want to do that.
- Go get it, Dragon.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.880
Were those wings?

10:12.420 --> 10:14.180
Oh, yeah, good one, Frankie.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.520
- A dog with wings.
- Yeah.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.810
Dragon is just like Michael Jordan.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.050
Every once in a while, a superstar comes
along and elevates the whole game.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.290
- Why is it burnt?
- lt's not burnt.

10:26.430 --> 10:27.870
lt's just like toast.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.800
You just brush off all the black stuff,
and it's good as new, see?

10:32.510 --> 10:35.240
All right. lt works for now.

10:35.370 --> 10:38.400
But something doesn't smell right
on Waverly Place.

10:40.250 --> 10:43.680
You leave the borough,
you check in with me.

10:45.050 --> 10:46.110
That was a close call.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.380
We gotta train Dragon
to act like a normal dog.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.550
Oh, there's a cat. Go get him.

10:53.590 --> 10:56.190
Not you, Dragon.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.760
All right. Hey. Stay down.

11:05.470 --> 11:07.770
He did it. But it was kind of cooler
when he would--

11:07.910 --> 11:12.040
Don't say F-L-Y around him.

11:12.310 --> 11:14.710
F-L-Y? Oh, fly.

11:15.850 --> 11:17.780
- Fly.
- Boy, it's so hot out here.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.080
Fly. Fly.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.480
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

11:21.620 --> 11:24.180
Said there's a lot of flies out here.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.120
- Where?
- Not up there, l meant ants.

11:28.390 --> 11:30.330
Flying ants.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.360
l hate ants.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.830
You know, there was this one time
your father fell asleep

11:34.970 --> 11:37.600
with a Danish on his chest,
and in the morning--

11:37.740 --> 11:39.570
We know, we know, he had an ant beard.
Go, go.

11:39.710 --> 11:42.870
- Fly, fly.
- Go get the ant spray.

11:43.110 --> 11:47.380
Man, we are lucky that the word ''fly''
came up a lot in conversation.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.310
Please tell me that was slobber.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.960
Okay. That was slobber.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.400
Come on, guys.
We gotta go check on Dragon.

12:12.540 --> 12:14.560
Yeah, we've never left him
home alone before.

12:14.710 --> 12:16.370
Hey, guys, l'm sure he's just fine.

12:16.510 --> 12:18.640
And if anyone messed with him,
he'd just breathe fire.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.770
- Yeah, that's what we're worried about.
- What?

12:20.910 --> 12:23.640
l thought we just didn't want him
to take leaks in the house.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.770
Hey, guys. Gotta go check on Dragon.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.350
- Wait, Justin.
- Justin.

12:29.490 --> 12:31.180
- l'll go tell him.
- What's the matter?

12:33.130 --> 12:34.650
Those fliers you put up worked.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.730
Dragon's rightful owner
came by and picked him up

12:36.860 --> 12:38.300
while you kids were at school.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.060
What rightful owner?

12:40.200 --> 12:42.790
Hey, guys. Where's Dragon?

12:42.940 --> 12:45.370
His owner claimed him.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.600
- His owner?
- Honey, l'm so sorry.

12:48.740 --> 12:50.830
l know how much you loved him.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.640
He's gone?

12:56.020 --> 12:57.780
There's so much we didn't get to do.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.080
Justin, l'm sorry.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.520
Thanks a lot.

13:03.820 --> 13:06.260
This is why l didn't wanna
get close to another dog.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.490
You did it to me again.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.200
You lost your found dog?

13:25.340 --> 13:27.470
Why don't you rest your head
on Frankie's shoulder

13:27.610 --> 13:29.580
and tell him all about it?

13:30.480 --> 13:32.780
l would, but l don't have time
for you to get a ladder.

13:34.450 --> 13:36.150
This is serious.
Someone claimed Dragon.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.280
But whoever it was
wasn't the real owner.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.450
That's weird,
because he looked like a dog lover.

13:41.590 --> 13:42.930
You saw him? Who was he?

13:43.060 --> 13:45.160
You got a meatball sub
with my name on it?

13:45.300 --> 13:46.390
l'll give you the bread now

13:46.530 --> 13:48.970
and you'll get your meatballs
after we find the dog-napper.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.970
The guy came out with your dog
and bought this.

13:53.810 --> 13:55.770
A program for the Hudson Dog Show.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.810
The Hudson Dog Show? When is it?

13:58.780 --> 14:01.110
Why don't you buy a copy and find out?

14:01.810 --> 14:02.910
l have to buy it?

14:03.050 --> 14:07.750
Do l come into your restaurant,
lick a sandwich and leave?

14:08.190 --> 14:10.020
Zinger!

14:10.560 --> 14:12.490
That'll be $8, please.

14:12.890 --> 14:14.550
Okay.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.320
lt's today.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.830
l'd like to return this for a refund.

14:20.970 --> 14:23.160
Zinger!

14:39.950 --> 14:41.390
May l help you?

14:42.390 --> 14:45.120
Yeah, can l get a hound of corned beef.

14:46.490 --> 14:49.090
- l'm sorry, did you say ''hound''?
- No.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.060
Man, everything reminds me of Dragon.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.390
- Everything.
- That's rough.

14:54.530 --> 14:56.130
''Rough.''

14:56.370 --> 14:58.360
That's what he used to say.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.830
- A pound of corned beef coming up.
- Thank you.

15:02.980 --> 15:05.740
Max, can you go in the back
and grab some more to-go pups?

15:06.180 --> 15:09.010
- ''Pups''?
- No. To-go cups.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.380
All he can think about is Dragon.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.580
Justin, Max, you're coming with me.
We're getting Dragon back.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.560
- Dad, we're taking our lunch break.
- Come on, guys. Hurry.

15:21.690 --> 15:23.630
''Furry.'' He was so furry.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.750
l miss him.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.670
- Three tickets for the dog show, please.
- lt's sold out.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.800
- What?
- Apparently, a lot of people like watching

15:39.950 --> 15:42.470
dogs run around on plastic grass.

15:43.580 --> 15:47.020
No dog, no way in.

15:47.650 --> 15:50.820
Large fries. See if there's a toy included.
Over.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.720
Alex will talk us in. She's a master.

15:54.860 --> 15:57.520
l totally understand.
Come on, guys, it's not happening.

15:57.660 --> 16:00.720
What? That's it?
We're not getting my dog back?

16:00.870 --> 16:03.770
Of course we're getting your dog back.
We just need to get a dog first.

16:04.270 --> 16:06.600
Where are we gonna find a dog
without an owner?

16:09.740 --> 16:10.800
lt worked. We're in.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.100
- Let's get Max.
- Okay.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.070
Okay.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.810
Huminoza espinoza

16:26.060 --> 16:27.690
Being a dog is weird.

16:27.830 --> 16:29.560
All you wanna do
is just chase your tail.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.760
l don't think l got the spell quite right.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.960
What makes you say that?

16:37.170 --> 16:39.400
l can still smell everything.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.130
Half of it l wanna put in my mouth.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.940
- Look. There he is.
- Dragon?

16:48.080 --> 16:50.240
And the dragon seller.
He stole Dragon back.

16:50.380 --> 16:53.680
- He's a con wizard.
- Come on, let's go get Dragon.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.690
Hey, you're a thief. You sold us that dog
and then stole it back.

16:56.820 --> 16:59.260
lt's the circle of life, children.

16:59.390 --> 17:00.690
We want our dog back.

17:00.830 --> 17:04.160
Look, kid,
you played the game and you lost.

17:04.300 --> 17:05.890
You know what? You go home,

17:06.030 --> 17:09.589
and the money you spent on the dog
was a lesson well learned.

17:09.740 --> 17:11.730
You're welcome.

17:11.869 --> 17:13.859
No deal. We're taking Dragon home.

17:14.010 --> 17:16.170
l don't think so.

17:16.310 --> 17:18.000
Look, he's gone.

17:19.140 --> 17:22.270
Oh, he's not gone.
He's still here. l can smell him.

17:22.410 --> 17:25.680
All we have to do
is get Max to smell the beagles.

17:25.819 --> 17:27.380
How do you know he's still a beagle?

17:27.520 --> 17:29.580
l changed him
from a dragon into a beagle,

17:29.720 --> 17:32.020
l can change him
into any dog that l want.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.220
l can change him into a terrier mix,
into an lrish bloodhound,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.390
or to whatever that is.

17:37.530 --> 17:42.130
Oh, it's not that.
That is a rat with a blow-dry.

17:43.570 --> 17:46.130
Max, can you sniff out Dragon?

17:46.270 --> 17:48.040
l can try.

17:48.970 --> 17:50.440
Nope.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.610
Not this one.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.440
Oh, definitely not this one.

17:56.980 --> 18:00.210
Are you through, freak?

18:02.860 --> 18:05.420
Bob, bring around the security trailer.
l got a sniffer.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.990
Great,
how are we gonna find Dragon now?

18:11.130 --> 18:13.760
Our sniffer just got thrown
in dog-show jail.

18:13.900 --> 18:17.270
Oh, l know. Dragons don't chase cats.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.800
lf we had a cat, all the dogs would go wild
chasing it, except for Dragon.

18:20.940 --> 18:22.740
l'm on it. l'll change myself into a cat.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.280
- But you always mess up the spell.
- Do you have a better idea? Didn't think so.

18:26.410 --> 18:29.040
Animoza espinoza

18:29.180 --> 18:31.980
How do l look? Cute, huh?

18:32.750 --> 18:35.120
- Oh, a tiger!
- Tiger?

18:37.360 --> 18:38.950
ls that a tiger?

18:39.090 --> 18:40.990
l think you messed up the spell again.

18:41.130 --> 18:43.620
Oh, no. l'm the tiger.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.390
l gotta get that spell right.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.760
Bob, bring the catnip.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.000
All of it.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.900
Make sure l get extra ketchup.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.270
Bob?

19:03.580 --> 19:05.240
Bob?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.820
Dragon.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.250
Oh, good boy.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.020
Okay, l left him a beagle,
and you found him.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.060
Good work, Velma and Shaggy.

19:22.130 --> 19:23.620
Come on.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.340
That's scary.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.410
- l still know it's you, kid.
- lt's worth a shot.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.950
Huminoza espinoza

19:41.450 --> 19:45.050
Would you like to excuse yourself
to a litter box? We're kind of busy.

19:45.790 --> 19:49.090
You know, l'd like to stay and chat,
but l've got a dog here l have to sell.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.360
Again and again and again.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.020
Not so fast. Look, you were right before.

19:55.170 --> 19:57.140
We've learned our lesson.
No hard feelings.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.290
l have hard feelings.

19:59.970 --> 20:03.370
We're just kids, and we should probably
thank someone like you

20:03.510 --> 20:05.240
for giving us street smarts

20:05.380 --> 20:08.350
and making us more cautious
with future purchases.

20:08.750 --> 20:12.410
Yeah. l am a pretty good teacher.

20:12.550 --> 20:14.710
So thank you, and have a good day.

20:14.850 --> 20:18.880
But don't forget your cage.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.150
You know, l never thought
l would say this to a customer,

20:23.300 --> 20:27.960
but it has been a pleasure
scamming you.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.300
What are you doing?
You let him get away with Dragon.

20:32.700 --> 20:36.270
You're right. l'm sorry.
Now all you have is

20:36.610 --> 20:37.870
- Dragon.
- Dragon.

20:38.010 --> 20:39.500
Alex, how did you do that?

20:39.650 --> 20:43.170
l just made him take the wrong cage,
like l do with you guys and our lunches.

20:44.180 --> 20:46.170
But who'd he take?

20:46.320 --> 20:47.680
The blow-dried rat.

20:47.820 --> 20:49.750
l saw the cage right there,
l thought on my feet,

20:49.890 --> 20:51.480
and l out-conned the con wizard.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.480
l'm good.

20:54.430 --> 20:56.120
Hairball.

20:57.930 --> 21:00.260
Yeah, you're just that good.

21:02.370 --> 21:04.730
So Dragon is really a dragon?

21:04.870 --> 21:06.130
Amazing.

21:06.270 --> 21:08.330
Actually,
there are a lot of secret dragons.

21:08.470 --> 21:11.340
No, that in a family of wizards,
l didn't see that coming.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.270
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

21:13.410 --> 21:16.310
- So can we keep him?
- Oh, l don't know, honey.

21:16.450 --> 21:19.780
Max will feed him every day, and Justin
will give him a bath and walk him.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.180
What will you do?

21:21.320 --> 21:23.880
l'm doing it.
l'm coordinating what you guys do.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.960
Actually, pets do teach responsibility.

21:27.090 --> 21:29.790
Jerry, you leave wet towels
on the bed every day.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.660
Fine, l'll air-dry. Can we keep him?

21:33.770 --> 21:35.890
Well, l don't see what harm he could do.

21:36.030 --> 21:37.830
Come on, Dragon,
let's go up to my room.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.900
Man.

21:44.540 --> 21:48.040
This time, Jerry, you can blame a dog.
This time.
