Hes-yang

00:39.153 --> 00:40.689
These Jelly Kinders aren't...

00:40.754 --> 00:42.131
alive, are they?

00:42.189 --> 00:43.189
What? No.

00:43.224 --> 00:44.328
They can't even talk.

00:44.391 --> 00:45.961
Bloo bloo-bloo bloop...

00:46.026 --> 00:46.970
Kick it!

00:47.027 --> 00:48.631
Thanks for helping me out, guys.

00:48.696 --> 00:50.369
What are these
boogers for, anyway?

00:50.431 --> 00:53.275
Oh, they're decorations for
my Biennial Gumball Ball...

00:53.334 --> 00:54.278
tonight!

00:54.335 --> 00:56.815
Sounds like it's gonna be large!

00:56.871 --> 01:00.080
Yes! So very large.

01:00.140 --> 01:02.620
I'd like you to be there
as my special guest.

01:02.676 --> 01:05.316
You want me to... go
with you to the ball?

01:05.379 --> 01:07.120
Heck yes.

01:07.181 --> 01:08.558
As my pal!

01:08.616 --> 01:10.323
Oh. Right.

01:10.384 --> 01:12.022
It starts at 7:00,
so don't be late!

01:14.889 --> 01:16.562
Fionna, we got trouble!

01:16.624 --> 01:18.433
My tail is totally frizzin' out.

01:18.492 --> 01:20.028
I'll check it out.

01:25.032 --> 01:26.238
It's Ice Queen!

01:26.300 --> 01:30.771
The Prince shall be <i>mine!</i>

01:30.838 --> 01:32.283
Back inside!

01:35.342 --> 01:37.913
Out of my way, Tomboy!

01:37.978 --> 01:40.288
Ice Queen, why you always
predatoring on dudes?

01:40.347 --> 01:43.920
Ha! You should talk, keeping
all the babes to yourself,

01:43.984 --> 01:46.055
totally ice-blocking my game!

01:46.120 --> 01:47.360
Wh a?

01:47.421 --> 01:50.334
Not... this time!

01:50.391 --> 01:53.998
Gah! Slush beast!

01:54.061 --> 01:55.335
Cake! Morningstar mode!

01:55.396 --> 01:56.670
Hup!

01:56.730 --> 01:58.767
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

02:03.637 --> 02:05.639
You saved me from the Ice Queen!

02:05.706 --> 02:07.481
Oh, uh, yeah, I guess.

02:07.541 --> 02:08.576
Is she gone?

02:08.642 --> 02:09.711
She must have fled.

02:09.776 --> 02:12.257
Fionna, you're so strong...

02:12.313 --> 02:14.759
and you look so
beautiful in the snow.

02:14.815 --> 02:16.453
What are you doing later?

02:16.517 --> 02:18.793
I was just going to go home...

02:18.852 --> 02:20.331
Come with me.

02:20.387 --> 02:21.422
Let's go out.

02:21.488 --> 02:22.489
Go out?

02:22.556 --> 02:23.626
Yeah.

02:23.691 --> 02:25.034
Let's go somewhere.

02:25.092 --> 02:26.036
What?

02:26.093 --> 02:27.037
We'd love to!

02:27.094 --> 02:28.198
Great!

02:28.262 --> 02:30.674
Meet me in the castle
gardens in an hour.

02:30.731 --> 02:31.937
Yes! We'll be there!

02:34.134 --> 02:35.238
Oh, it's a date!

02:35.302 --> 02:36.747
No, it's not.

02:36.804 --> 02:38.112
I'm sure when he said, "Go out,"

02:38.172 --> 02:39.515
he meant "Go out," not "go out!"

02:39.573 --> 02:41.075
Shut up! He's into you!

02:41.141 --> 02:42.711
Come on! You heard what he said.

02:42.776 --> 02:44.449
I'm like his guy friend.

02:44.511 --> 02:45.888
Well, that could change tonight!

02:45.946 --> 02:47.857
If it's a date, why
are you coming?

02:47.915 --> 02:49.087
I'm coming to help you.

02:49.149 --> 02:50.321
Hold on.

02:50.384 --> 02:51.692
I'm bringing my dulcimer.

02:51.752 --> 02:53.288
Aw, man!

02:53.354 --> 02:54.890
It's a conversation starter.

02:54.955 --> 02:56.730
Fine.

02:56.790 --> 02:59.168
I'll do this, if only
to prove you wrong.

03:01.795 --> 03:03.297
Mm. Let's just bail.

03:03.364 --> 03:04.434
I changed my mind.

03:04.498 --> 03:05.499
No!

03:05.566 --> 03:07.204
No retreat, girl.

03:07.267 --> 03:08.837
Hello, Fionna.

03:08.902 --> 03:10.006
And I see you brought Cake.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.310
That's cool, right?

03:11.372 --> 03:13.215
Only if it's cool
that I brought...

03:13.273 --> 03:15.310
Lord Monochromicorn.

03:16.677 --> 03:18.088
How are you, gorgeous?

03:21.582 --> 03:23.391
Accept these tokens
of our esteem.

03:23.450 --> 03:25.430
Hey, you didn't have to, guy.

03:25.486 --> 03:26.396
Nonsense.

03:26.453 --> 03:27.557
For you, Cake...

03:27.621 --> 03:29.294
A satchel of Nepetalactone.

03:29.356 --> 03:30.664
Mo-cro picked it himself.

03:30.724 --> 03:33.000
Catnip! Sweet babies!

03:33.060 --> 03:35.301
And for you, M'lady...

03:35.362 --> 03:36.864
a bouquet of posies.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.308
Oh, uh... they're...

03:39.366 --> 03:40.811
there's a surprise
at the center.

03:40.868 --> 03:42.438
Huh?

03:42.503 --> 03:43.743
A crystal sword!

03:43.804 --> 03:45.181
I'm all about swords!

03:45.239 --> 03:46.479
How did you know?!

03:46.540 --> 03:49.987
I pay attention to things I
see you being all about.

03:50.044 --> 03:51.717
Thanks, dude.

03:51.779 --> 03:53.918
It's just... wow.

03:53.981 --> 03:55.119
Come.

03:55.182 --> 03:58.220
For the wovviness has
only just begun!

04:00.988 --> 04:02.467
Psst! Fi.

04:02.523 --> 04:04.764
Tell Gumball that you
think he's "Hawt."

04:04.825 --> 04:06.099
What? No!

04:06.160 --> 04:08.197
Guys like to hear
that they're hot!

04:08.262 --> 04:09.707
Will you keep your voice down?!

04:09.763 --> 04:11.299
Oh, Fionna!

04:11.365 --> 04:12.742
Hey! What's up?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.360
I thought we might
have a little race...

04:14.401 --> 04:18.315
A playful race... To
Marshmallovvy Mweadows.

04:18.372 --> 04:19.281
Okay.

04:19.339 --> 04:20.682
But I'm gonna kick your butt.

04:20.741 --> 04:22.982
Not that I'm
thinking of butts...

04:23.043 --> 04:24.078
Excellent.

04:24.144 --> 04:25.316
Hyah!

04:25.379 --> 04:26.585
After him, Fionna!

04:26.647 --> 04:28.024
After your man!

04:32.086 --> 04:33.588
Whoooooo!

04:38.125 --> 04:41.197
Good race, Fionna.

04:41.261 --> 04:43.571
Why are y'all breathless
if we're the ones runnin'?

04:50.170 --> 04:51.012
Hup!

04:51.071 --> 04:52.641
Gumball!

04:56.910 --> 04:59.083
Sorry. I saw a pearl
Pygmy skull in there.

04:59.146 --> 05:03.185
It reminded me of you... The
way your eyes... sparkle.

05:07.354 --> 05:10.267

stupidest thing ever.

06:11.485 --> 06:13.123
See you back at the treehouse!

06:18.659 --> 06:20.104
Geez, I don't know.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.538
I've thought about it, but...
I think you could wear your

06:22.596 --> 06:24.974
pants as a shirt, if
you really needed to.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.002
Okay, okay.

06:28.068 --> 06:29.411
Now you ask me something.

06:29.469 --> 06:32.814
Oh, uh... is this a date'?

06:34.474 --> 06:37.080
Fionna... come to
the ball with me.

06:37.144 --> 06:38.919
As your... chum?

06:38.979 --> 06:40.151
No.

06:40.214 --> 06:43.252
As my <i>girlfriend</i>

06:44.718 --> 06:45.822
It was a date!

06:45.886 --> 06:46.930
There was singing and junk!

06:46.954 --> 06:47.898
I know!

06:47.955 --> 06:49.298
I was there for that part!

06:49.356 --> 06:51.859
Cake, he wants me to go to
the bail was his girlfriend!

06:51.925 --> 06:53.063
Oh, my goodness!

06:53.126 --> 06:54.126
It's almost 7:00!

06:54.161 --> 06:55.333
You need something to wear!

06:55.395 --> 06:56.499
Oh, hold on, honey.

06:56.563 --> 06:58.167
I'm gonna make this happen!

07:02.836 --> 07:04.782
How am I supposed to fit
my weapons in this?

07:04.838 --> 07:06.249
It's a ball!

07:06.306 --> 07:07.785
You don't need weapons!

07:07.841 --> 07:09.616
I'll take my retractable sword.

07:09.676 --> 07:11.622
Okay! Let's go, go, go!

07:20.787 --> 07:21.993
Lovely, lovely.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.438
Yes, I designed it myself.

07:30.797 --> 07:32.140
I've been looking for you.

07:32.199 --> 07:34.042
Well, here I am.

07:34.101 --> 07:35.341
Ha ha!

07:35.402 --> 07:37.712
Hey, I want to show
you something.

07:37.771 --> 07:38.715
Okay.

07:38.772 --> 07:39.807
Whoo!

07:39.873 --> 07:41.147
Okay, girl! See you later!

07:47.347 --> 07:48.417
What?

07:48.482 --> 07:49.522
Hey, is this your bedroom?

07:49.549 --> 07:50.994
Fionna...

07:52.686 --> 07:53.858
Whoa.

07:56.790 --> 07:57.790
What?!

08:04.831 --> 08:07.744
This was so much easier
than I thought it would be!

08:07.801 --> 08:10.975
This is really messed
up, Ice Queen!

08:11.038 --> 08:13.484
What is your problem with me?!

08:15.275 --> 08:18.313
You're what stands between
me and my Gumball!

08:22.049 --> 08:23.960
I can't believe I
fell for this trash!

08:24.017 --> 08:26.964
You got me to show up with
that dress and a pur...

08:27.020 --> 08:28.055
My purse!

08:28.121 --> 08:29.191
My Sword!

08:34.461 --> 08:35.461
Aah!

08:35.495 --> 08:36.871
You like my ice sword?

08:38.432 --> 08:39.433
Get it off me!

08:39.499 --> 08:40.499
Fionna?

08:52.379 --> 08:54.450
Yaaaaaaah!

08:57.351 --> 08:59.058
Oh, my goodness!

08:59.119 --> 09:01.759
What's going on in he-

09:01.822 --> 09:04.029
Aaaaah!

09:04.091 --> 09:05.593
Don't you touch her!

09:05.659 --> 09:06.865
Aaah!

09:06.927 --> 09:08.702
Shh! It's okay, it's okay!

09:08.762 --> 09:10.366
It was the Ice Queen.

09:10.430 --> 09:13.001
Paws off my Prince!

09:13.066 --> 09:15.376
Aaaaaah!

09:17.270 --> 09:18.613
Donk! Unh!

09:20.741 --> 09:21.742
My magic tiara!

09:21.808 --> 09:22.878
My Powers!

09:22.943 --> 09:26.083
And this is for yankin'
my heart guts!

09:27.948 --> 09:30.053
Ha ha! I'm a Queen!

09:30.117 --> 09:31.118
No.

09:31.184 --> 09:32.527
You might catch her crazy.

09:32.586 --> 09:35.328
Wow, Fionna... you're...
you're just...

09:35.389 --> 09:37.027
really incredible.

09:37.090 --> 09:38.660
Maybe we should meet up...

09:38.725 --> 09:40.227
for a date!

09:40.293 --> 09:41.465
No way, man.

09:41.528 --> 09:42.528
Not interested.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.842
I think the reason I got all
these guy friends and no

09:45.866 --> 09:49.006
boyfriend is because I don't
really want to date any of 'em.

09:49.069 --> 09:51.948
I don't need to feel like
I'm waiting to be noticed.

09:52.005 --> 09:54.747
I know who I am, and
I'll know what I want

09:54.808 --> 09:57.118
if and when it ever comes along.

09:57.177 --> 09:59.987
But there is one guy I'd
do anything to date...

10:00.047 --> 10:01.492
The Ice King!

10:01.548 --> 10:02.288
What?

10:02.349 --> 10:03.384
Me, too.

10:03.450 --> 10:05.020
Ice King's the <i>real</i> deal.

10:09.523 --> 10:13.630
Ice King is the hottest hottie,
and I can't wait to marry him!

10:13.693 --> 10:15.229
Said Fionna.

10:15.295 --> 10:18.071
Then she turned to
Prince Gumball and said,

10:18.131 --> 10:20.941
"I hope Ice King will sweep
me off my feet and take me

10:21.001 --> 10:23.811
to the farthest corner of
Ooo, where we will do nothing

10:23.870 --> 10:27.818
but kiss and eat a whole bunch
until we get fat and die!"

10:27.874 --> 10:29.376
The end.

10:29.443 --> 10:32.219
So, what did you think
of the fan-fiction

10:32.279 --> 10:33.883
I wrote about you guys?

10:33.947 --> 10:35.517
Uhh...

10:35.582 --> 10:37.289
Tell me you thought it was good!

10:37.350 --> 10:38.556
Uh, it's good! It's good!

10:38.618 --> 10:40.458
It's... it's really good, dude!
It was amazing!
