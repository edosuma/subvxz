00:02.851 --> 00:06.500
If you did separate,
I'd stay with you?

00:06.524 --> 00:08.228
Your father and I
are not going to separate.

00:08.252 --> 00:11.252
I don't want you to go.
Why can't I stay with you?

00:12.028 --> 00:15.028
Why do we make a mistake?
Why do "we", or why do I?

00:15.484 --> 00:18.484
Lack of information. Stupidity.
Or as a protest.

00:19.708 --> 00:22.244
Because he's wasted 20 years
trying to be the man

00:22.268 --> 00:24.420
that you wanted him to be.
He needs to find out who he is.

00:24.444 --> 00:27.444
Sometimes I speak - not think.
Don't tell Father.

00:28.476 --> 00:31.476
Your son can't be trusted.
What have you done?

00:32.764 --> 00:35.172
She doesn't believe it yet,
but she will.

00:35.196 --> 00:37.412
We need to talk.
The three of us.

00:37.436 --> 00:40.100
You don't know him.
Not like this.

00:40.124 --> 00:43.124
Not the man who's about to arrive.

00:46.140 --> 00:49.140
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:46.748 --> 01:48.260
Morning, Max.

01:48.284 --> 01:51.284
Good morning, Mr Goldstein.

02:28.924 --> 02:31.924
That's enough.
Right, back to work, everyone.

02:31.996 --> 02:34.996
Let's go. Come on.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.772
Back to work!

03:57.180 --> 04:00.180
Your father's on his way.

04:29.116 --> 04:32.116
How are your lessons, Max?
Very good, sir.

04:35.392 --> 04:38.392
And how's Mr Goldstein?
He's an excellent teacher, sir.

04:40.124 --> 04:43.124
You're fond of him?

04:43.388 --> 04:46.388
His lessons are thorough, sir.

04:47.356 --> 04:50.356
I have a lesson for you.

04:50.876 --> 04:53.876
Yes, sir.
I need you to deliver this letter.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.428
To Mr Roberts, sir?
He works in this factory.

05:01.756 --> 05:04.756
You're to wait for his reply.
Can you do that for me?

05:07.004 --> 05:10.004
Mr Roberts! Mr Roberts!
Letter for Mr Roberts!

05:13.660 --> 05:16.660
Mr Roberts?

05:26.972 --> 05:29.972
Mr Roberts? A letter, sir.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.220
For you, sir.

05:33.244 --> 05:36.244
And I'm supposed to wait
for your reply.

05:54.492 --> 05:56.644
Sir?

05:56.668 --> 05:59.668
I need your reply.

06:06.524 --> 06:09.524
I can't lose this job.
My family depends on me.

06:10.556 --> 06:13.556
You tell your fa...

06:19.004 --> 06:22.004
Sir, Mr Roberts says, "I can't lose
this job. My family depends on me."

06:27.068 --> 06:30.068
"Tell your father -
my family depends on me."

06:34.684 --> 06:37.684
A worker lost his hand today.

06:38.908 --> 06:41.908
Yes, sir. Whose fault is it?
Is it my fault?

06:44.032 --> 06:45.604
No, sir.

06:45.628 --> 06:48.628
So it's Mr Roberts' fault?

06:49.084 --> 06:51.236
Yes, sir.

06:51.260 --> 06:53.988
So he had to go.

06:54.012 --> 06:55.460
Yes, sir.

06:55.484 --> 06:57.252
Put your hand in my pocket. Sir?

06:57.276 --> 07:00.276
Put your hand in my pocket.

07:04.956 --> 07:06.596
What is it?

07:06.620 --> 07:08.260
Iron ore, sir.

07:08.284 --> 07:11.284
The raw material for this factory.
Yes, sir.

07:12.124 --> 07:15.124
Pure iron is soft,
you can bend it, shape it,

07:16.348 --> 07:19.348
but add impurities - carbon, dirt -
and you make it stronger.

07:22.556 --> 07:25.556
You make it steel. Yes, sir.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.820
Look at your tutor.

07:30.172 --> 07:33.172
Would you say he's iron or steel?

07:33.564 --> 07:35.012
A clever man.

07:35.036 --> 07:38.036
Learned in poetry and literature.

07:38.108 --> 07:40.068
A kind and gentle man.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.540
Your friend, it seems.

07:41.564 --> 07:43.652
Right now he thinks that I'm cruel.

07:43.676 --> 07:46.676
A cruel father
to such a sensitive young boy.

07:47.260 --> 07:50.260
Yet why doesn't he speak out?

07:55.580 --> 07:58.580
Is that the kind of man
YOU want to be?

08:02.044 --> 08:05.044
Is that the man YOU want to be?

08:07.804 --> 08:10.804
No, sir.

08:13.312 --> 08:15.972
You're iron, my son.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.996
I'm going to make you steel.

09:16.988 --> 09:19.988
Can I come in?

09:54.620 --> 09:57.620
Right now we're standing here,
the three of us.

09:58.844 --> 10:00.868
At this moment,

10:00.892 --> 10:03.892
nothing's happened,
nothing's been decided.

10:05.116 --> 10:07.652
The two of you have spoken,
I understand that.

10:07.676 --> 10:10.676
You've shared information,
that's fine.

10:12.476 --> 10:15.268
People talk, it doesn't matter.

10:15.292 --> 10:17.572
What matters is what people do.

10:17.596 --> 10:20.596
And all you've done is to invite me
up to this house for dinner.

10:23.484 --> 10:26.084
Dinner? Yes, right.

10:26.108 --> 10:29.108
Max, there's no dinner. Well, there
could be. A family dinner?

10:29.500 --> 10:32.500
I want us to take a moment, yeah.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.260
To do what?

10:36.284 --> 10:37.604
To appreciate this.

10:37.628 --> 10:40.628
There's no... no yelling, no crying,
no-one getting angry.

10:41.532 --> 10:44.532
No-one's... no-one's making threats.

10:45.948 --> 10:48.740
Just...

10:48.764 --> 10:51.764
...silence.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.980
Are we going to stand here
all night?

10:59.004 --> 11:02.004
Sure, I can do that,
I can do whatever you want me to do.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.460
I'm yours, right?

11:06.492 --> 11:09.092
There - see?

11:09.116 --> 11:10.500
You called me up here.

11:10.524 --> 11:12.484
I'm not going anywhere.

11:12.508 --> 11:14.404
I'm in no rush.

11:14.428 --> 11:17.428
So, why not just take a moment?

11:19.740 --> 11:21.572
I want to make sure.

11:21.596 --> 11:24.596
I need for all of us
to make sure

11:25.116 --> 11:28.116
that this is
a line we want to cross.

11:33.628 --> 11:35.780
Have you eaten?

11:35.804 --> 11:38.212
No.I don't want to eat.

11:38.236 --> 11:41.236
When was the last time the three
of us actually had a meal together?

11:42.652 --> 11:45.252
A long time ago.
What, about 20 years?

11:45.276 --> 11:48.276
Yeah, something like that.
Yeah, I remember.

11:48.604 --> 11:51.204
I remember actually the last meal
as a family.

11:51.228 --> 11:52.932
So come on. We'll eat.

11:52.956 --> 11:55.956
And we'll... think and decide.

11:59.036 --> 12:02.036
OK. What have you got?

12:33.532 --> 12:35.492
Are you all right?

12:35.516 --> 12:38.516
Sorry.

12:41.916 --> 12:44.916
I got it.

13:18.076 --> 13:21.076
How long before the three of us
will sit like this together again?

13:27.868 --> 13:30.340
Depends on tonight.

13:30.364 --> 13:33.364
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

13:37.020 --> 13:40.004
Do you know why you remember
our last meal?

13:40.028 --> 13:43.028
Because you knew you were going
to divorce me the next day.

13:45.724 --> 13:48.724
You didn't know? I thought we had
something worth saving.

13:52.060 --> 13:55.060
Yes, we had something...
worth saving.

13:56.032 --> 13:58.500
We also had something
that couldn't be saved.

13:58.524 --> 14:01.524
Did you give THAT a chance...
to discuss it?

14:02.172 --> 14:05.172
That's what we're going to do now.
Talk.

14:07.484 --> 14:09.060
I have a suggestion.

14:09.084 --> 14:11.364
That we don't talk. Not talk?

14:11.388 --> 14:12.964
Not right now. Not after the meal.

14:12.988 --> 14:14.820
Not at all. I told you!

14:14.844 --> 14:16.804
That's why you're here.
That's why we called you.

14:16.828 --> 14:18.404
That's why you called me. Yes.
To talk.

14:18.428 --> 14:20.644
But that's not why I'm here.
Why ARE you here?

14:20.668 --> 14:22.628
To tell you that I don't think
we should talk.

14:22.652 --> 14:25.380
This meal is a trick!
No, it's not a trick.

14:25.404 --> 14:28.404
So we feel close.
It's not a trick!

14:28.604 --> 14:30.436
Like a real family.

14:30.460 --> 14:33.252
The plate, the plate,
the dropped plate.

14:33.276 --> 14:34.408
What about the plate?

14:34.432 --> 14:37.432
The plate you dropped,
it was deliberate.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.604
It wasn't the stroke. Be honest.

14:45.628 --> 14:47.076
Max, you can't do this again.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.700
You dropped it... Refuse to talk.
..deliberately.

14:49.724 --> 14:52.132
To let us all know.
Let you know what?

14:52.156 --> 14:54.756
That this was not going
to end well.

14:54.780 --> 14:57.780
You don't want it to end well,
do you? But it can.

14:58.492 --> 15:00.260
We can just eat our meal here,

15:00.284 --> 15:02.820
we will say our goodbyes
and go back to our lives.

15:02.844 --> 15:04.740
Our broken lives.

15:04.764 --> 15:07.172
Caden, you're in love.

15:07.196 --> 15:09.604
You're getting better,
things are looking up!

15:09.628 --> 15:12.100
Why would you want to fight
with me? Over what?

15:12.124 --> 15:15.124
My work?

15:15.324 --> 15:18.324
We have to talk about this.
If we talk, we fight.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.212
This is the line, this is it,
this is the decision.

15:26.396 --> 15:28.100
Do you want to go over that line
or not?

15:28.124 --> 15:30.340
If you go over the line,
there's no coming back.

15:30.364 --> 15:33.364
How does it end?

15:36.572 --> 15:38.728
The way all fights end.

15:38.752 --> 15:39.688
Badly.

15:39.712 --> 15:42.692
Unless... not another word?

15:42.716 --> 15:45.716
Then good... for you.

15:45.788 --> 15:48.788
Good for me? Good for you too,
good for all of us.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.860
A cover-up? Cover-up!
Families are a cover-up.

15:52.892 --> 15:55.892
Families are hundreds of cover-ups.

15:57.372 --> 16:00.372
Let's just finish our meal.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.428
And then we talk.

16:18.684 --> 16:20.260
All right. Let's do it.

16:20.284 --> 16:23.284
Let's just get it over with.
Let's talk.

16:24.444 --> 16:26.020
I'm not going to stop you any more.

16:26.044 --> 16:28.260
That's it! I was trying
to help you out,

16:28.284 --> 16:31.076
but that didn't work, so let's...
Come on, let's go in the other room

16:31.100 --> 16:34.100
and we will talk.

16:43.516 --> 16:45.540
This is you.
Your mother's doing it for you.

16:45.564 --> 16:48.564
No. Fuck you, Dad.

16:49.084 --> 16:50.404
Great.

16:50.428 --> 16:51.940
OK. Thank you.

16:51.964 --> 16:54.564
Well, there we have it.

16:54.588 --> 16:57.588
We can pretend that this is
about the news or, er, ethics,

16:58.428 --> 17:01.428
journalism, society, whatever,
but, no, this is about an angry son

17:01.948 --> 17:04.948
wanting to tell his father
to go fuck himself.

17:05.596 --> 17:08.195
And that's all.
Well, now you've done it.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.220
"Fuck you, Dad." Good. Do you feel
better? Fine. Now be a man.

17:13.723 --> 17:15.811
Now be a man? Be a man.

17:15.836 --> 17:18.500
Tell your mother you don't need her
to fight your fights,

17:18.523 --> 17:21.523
and we can all go home.
All this make-believe.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.044
All this fake family.

17:23.068 --> 17:25.732
What's fake? This family.

17:25.756 --> 17:28.756
It's not true. There's no... love.

17:29.212 --> 17:30.404
That's not true.

17:30.428 --> 17:33.428
And there never was.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.724
You hear him? He's wrong.

17:38.748 --> 17:40.324
He can't make decisions like this.

17:40.348 --> 17:42.372
His thinking is not clear.

17:42.396 --> 17:43.588
I'm sitting right here!

17:43.612 --> 17:46.612
I'm not part of your conspiracy.

17:48.028 --> 17:51.028
And I'm not afraid of you.

17:51.356 --> 17:54.340
Should I be afraid of YOU?
Is that what you want?

17:54.364 --> 17:57.364
We are going to talk about
extortion, blackmail...

17:58.844 --> 18:00.292
Oh, Kathryn!..bribery...

18:00.316 --> 18:03.044
Kathryn!..theft... KATHRYN! Stop!

18:03.068 --> 18:06.068
Stop! Right now!
We have one more chance.

18:07.356 --> 18:10.356
Please... end this before it starts.

18:10.812 --> 18:12.260
You're brilliant.

18:12.284 --> 18:14.052
You're a brilliant bully.

18:14.076 --> 18:17.076
I'm belligerent when I'm right.

18:18.172 --> 18:20.964
I'm right about this.

18:20.988 --> 18:23.988
Are you ever wrong?

18:25.724 --> 18:28.724
I didn't realise
you wanted to save our marriage.

18:36.028 --> 18:39.028
You really are something else.

18:39.164 --> 18:42.164
Why are you doing this?
Are you doing it for him?

18:43.964 --> 18:45.732
It won't help him.

18:45.756 --> 18:47.332
You're trying to protect us?

18:47.356 --> 18:50.356
Yes, yes, I am. And I'm afraid.

18:51.324 --> 18:53.028
For who? For us?

18:53.052 --> 18:56.052
For you, for him...

18:56.700 --> 18:59.700
The only person who could hurt us
is you.

19:07.324 --> 19:08.900
Happy Birthday, Max.

19:08.924 --> 19:11.924
Thank you, sir.

19:15.644 --> 19:17.412
17 years old.

19:17.436 --> 19:19.652
Yes, sir.

19:19.676 --> 19:22.212
It can't have
escaped your attention

19:22.236 --> 19:25.236
that you've led a sheltered life.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.780
Sheltered in what sense, sir?

19:27.804 --> 19:30.804
Well, you know, the world outside
my factories... The passions,

19:33.500 --> 19:35.140
the pleasures...

19:35.164 --> 19:37.572
What do you need me to know?

19:37.596 --> 19:40.596
You're a small-town boy,
and it shows.

19:40.924 --> 19:43.924
In particular,
you know nothing of women.

19:46.108 --> 19:47.620
Women, sir?

19:47.644 --> 19:49.220
As a man talking to another man,

19:49.244 --> 19:52.244
tell me, what do you know of love?

20:00.124 --> 20:03.124
Nothing, sir.

20:05.948 --> 20:08.948
Russian caviar.

20:12.476 --> 20:13.860
Foie gras...

20:13.884 --> 20:16.548
Shaved Italian white truffles...

20:16.572 --> 20:19.572
And here we have, poached in butter,
the lobster tail,

20:20.028 --> 20:23.028
and steak tartare with
accoutrements.

20:23.872 --> 20:25.956
Do these foods impress you?

20:25.980 --> 20:28.980
I've never tried them, sir.

20:29.756 --> 20:32.756
Today you try them.
You try them all.

21:18.716 --> 21:21.716
Your birthday present.

21:35.164 --> 21:38.164
Top-floor suite.

21:39.644 --> 21:42.644
I'll wait here.

22:25.340 --> 22:28.340
Hello?

23:06.300 --> 23:08.772
You were expecting me?

23:08.796 --> 23:10.628
Someone like you, yes.

23:10.652 --> 23:12.868
A prostitute, you mean?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.980
Yes, ma'am.

23:15.004 --> 23:18.004
Were you hoping for a younger woman?

23:18.908 --> 23:21.908
Ma'am, I wasn't hoping for anyone.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.436
Have you ever seen a naked woman?

23:26.460 --> 23:28.100
I have, yes.

23:28.124 --> 23:31.124
Not a magazine - in the flesh.

23:32.348 --> 23:33.796
Yes, ma'am.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.820
May I ask where?

23:38.876 --> 23:41.092
There's a lake near our house.

23:41.116 --> 23:44.116
Last summer I saw a young
woman swimming.

23:45.596 --> 23:48.596
She thought she was alone.
Are you sure?

23:48.860 --> 23:49.924
Of what?

23:49.948 --> 23:52.948
That she thought she was alone?

23:55.516 --> 23:58.516
You are the most eligible bachelor
in the state.

24:02.044 --> 24:05.044
You go for regular walks?
Country strolls?

24:06.908 --> 24:09.908
Yes? Yes.

24:10.236 --> 24:13.236
Your father is not the only one
who leaves nothing to chance.

24:17.148 --> 24:20.148
Pass me my towel.

24:41.468 --> 24:44.468
Dry me.

24:58.172 --> 25:01.172
It's not an errand.

25:32.284 --> 25:35.284
Your father worries you'll fall
in love with the first naked lady

25:38.044 --> 25:41.044
who swims in a lake.

25:42.460 --> 25:45.380
That you're vulnerable.

25:45.404 --> 25:48.328
Susceptible.

25:48.352 --> 25:49.668
He's right, of course.

25:49.692 --> 25:52.692
I understand his concerns.

25:55.516 --> 25:58.516
He wants you to enjoy
the many pleasures on offer.

25:59.996 --> 26:02.996
But under conditions he controls.

26:05.436 --> 26:08.436
So that you'll never mistake
these feelings for love.

26:13.564 --> 26:16.564
Because I'm old

26:16.892 --> 26:19.892
and a woman you couldn't possibly
love...

26:20.604 --> 26:23.604
...I'm going to teach you something.

26:24.832 --> 26:27.832
Something... I was forced to learn.

26:32.444 --> 26:35.444
Aren't you going to ask
what it was?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.860
What did you learn, ma'am?

26:37.884 --> 26:39.844
How to become numb.

26:39.868 --> 26:42.084
Sex doesn't influence me.

26:42.108 --> 26:44.708
Doesn't influence the way I feel.

26:44.732 --> 26:47.732
Doesn't influence my moods
or my decisions.

26:47.996 --> 26:50.996
It's just a smell, a sound,
a sensation.

26:52.860 --> 26:55.860
I keep my real self far away,
in another body.

26:58.364 --> 27:01.364
One that no-one else can ever see
or touch or know.

27:08.924 --> 27:10.888
I'd like to thank you for your time,
but I'm sorry,

27:10.912 --> 27:13.912
there's been a mistake.

27:17.308 --> 27:19.652
Well, then.

27:19.676 --> 27:21.892
Our business here is done.

27:21.916 --> 27:24.580
And I'm sure you'll still be paid
the full amount.

27:24.604 --> 27:27.604
I'm always paid the full amount.

28:01.084 --> 28:02.852
Thank you, sir.

28:02.876 --> 28:05.876
I appreciate all the thought that's
gone into these arrangements,

28:07.228 --> 28:10.084
and I promise I won't make any rash
decisions of the heart.

28:10.108 --> 28:13.108
I knew you'd say no.

28:16.188 --> 28:19.188
You're pretending it's
because you're a proper young man,

28:20.412 --> 28:23.412
but, er, you're a nervous virgin,

28:24.124 --> 28:27.124
shy and overwhelmed.

28:28.796 --> 28:31.796
I have some suggestions
to deal with the issues you raised.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.532
I was thinking that
if I met someone,

28:34.556 --> 28:37.556
I'd introduce her to you first,
before I became... too attached.

28:40.316 --> 28:43.316
Passions are powerful forces.

28:43.580 --> 28:46.372
You think you can control them
better than other men?

28:46.396 --> 28:49.060
Better than me?

28:49.084 --> 28:51.688
I fell in love... once.

28:51.712 --> 28:53.988
With your mother.

28:54.012 --> 28:57.012
She was a dancer in Chicago
at a club called Chez Paris.

28:59.260 --> 29:02.260
I saw her one night, under
bright lights, and lost my mind.

29:03.232 --> 29:05.252
For many months I thought
of little else.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.364
I neglected my business.

29:07.388 --> 29:09.540
Travelled to Chicago
as often as I could.

29:09.564 --> 29:11.332
In the end, I married her,

29:11.356 --> 29:14.356
brought her home, as if I were her
saviour. But she belonged on stage.

29:16.348 --> 29:19.348
She was addicted to the adoration
of many men.

29:25.244 --> 29:28.244
At home, with nothing to do,
drink took hold of her.

29:29.276 --> 29:32.276
So strong on stage,
so weak in real life.

29:32.476 --> 29:35.476
You see, Max, there are only two
types of marriage -

29:37.212 --> 29:40.212
those that add,
those that take away.

29:43.100 --> 29:46.100
I thought a child might steady her,
but you only made her worse.

29:46.748 --> 29:49.748
And one day, I came home
to find her in the kitchen,

29:50.524 --> 29:53.524
sitting there, a drink in one hand,
cigarette in the other.

29:55.260 --> 29:58.260
She'd placed you on a breadboard -

29:59.164 --> 30:01.380
a tiny baby -

30:01.404 --> 30:04.004
as though you were a little
loaf of bread,

30:04.028 --> 30:07.028
with a knife by your head.

30:07.228 --> 30:10.228
When I told her she'd never see you
again, you know what she said?

30:12.476 --> 30:15.476
Nothing at all.

30:18.044 --> 30:19.812
My mother's alive?

30:19.836 --> 30:20.964
She's dead.

30:20.988 --> 30:22.244
Like I said.

30:22.268 --> 30:25.252
Dead to the real world.

30:25.276 --> 30:28.276
She's in a sanatorium.

30:32.252 --> 30:35.252
Now, son,
I want you to go back upstairs...

30:38.716 --> 30:41.716
...and fuck her.

31:45.596 --> 31:48.596
So he told you about your poor mom?

32:05.308 --> 32:08.308
Take off your gown.

32:09.916 --> 32:12.916
Take off your gown.

32:12.988 --> 32:15.988
Yes, Max.

32:32.124 --> 32:35.124
How did you know?

32:35.708 --> 32:37.412
How did I know what?

32:37.436 --> 32:40.436
That I'm in love.

32:41.724 --> 32:44.724
You said at dinner,
"You're in love." How do you know?

32:48.956 --> 32:51.956
I haven't told you.

32:54.588 --> 32:57.588
But I already know how, don't I?

32:59.964 --> 33:02.964
You taught me...

33:03.356 --> 33:06.356
...but who would you have used?

33:11.292 --> 33:14.292
Andrew.

33:15.388 --> 33:18.180
My friend.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.204
My ONLY friend.

33:21.404 --> 33:23.940
Someone I like.

33:23.964 --> 33:26.964
Someone close to me.

33:27.356 --> 33:30.356
His job was to help me.

33:31.452 --> 33:34.452
Help me walk and talk.

33:36.892 --> 33:39.892
Someone for me... spying for you.

33:42.396 --> 33:44.996
Max, is that true?

33:45.020 --> 33:46.020
Max.

33:46.044 --> 33:49.044
Is it true?

33:51.740 --> 33:54.740
My bedroom, is it bugged?

33:58.396 --> 34:01.396
A hospital...?

34:02.876 --> 34:05.876
Spying in a military hospital?

34:06.716 --> 34:09.572
And what about here? In this house?

34:09.596 --> 34:12.388
Do you listen to Mum's phone calls?

34:12.411 --> 34:15.411
Max?! Answer!

34:22.844 --> 34:25.844
What was I supposed to do?

34:26.108 --> 34:29.108
Let Caden tell every pretty nurse
everything about me?

34:30.716 --> 34:33.716
We know the secrets of nations.

34:34.172 --> 34:37.172
The private lives of presidents
and prime ministers.

34:38.012 --> 34:39.652
We could break governments.

34:39.676 --> 34:42.676
It's not an exaggeration,
or showing off - it's true.

34:44.156 --> 34:47.156
So I took precautions, that's all.

34:48.380 --> 34:51.380
Sensible precautions.

34:52.027 --> 34:55.027
You think I did this
to find out what you say about me

34:55.356 --> 34:58.356
or who you sleep with?

34:58.748 --> 35:01.748
I have a duty to my secrets.

35:03.676 --> 35:06.676
Tell me her name.

35:08.032 --> 35:11.032
You really are in love, aren't you?

35:11.548 --> 35:13.508
You're doing this for her.

35:13.532 --> 35:15.300
To show how much she means to you.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.860
To show how you're different
from me.

35:17.884 --> 35:19.460
You're a lover now.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.124
It's fine, Caden.

35:21.148 --> 35:23.684
You don't want to follow the same
path as me, I'm OK with that.

35:23.708 --> 35:26.708
Tell me her name.

35:28.764 --> 35:31.764
Her name is Orla, Orla Reid.

35:32.284 --> 35:34.692
She was born in Belfast.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.932
The youngest of three children.

35:36.956 --> 35:39.956
She's 25 years old.

35:40.476 --> 35:42.180
Her mother died when she was seven.

35:42.204 --> 35:44.676
Joined the Army when she was 16.

35:44.700 --> 35:47.700
I've seen all the assessment
reports, her medical files.

35:48.796 --> 35:51.796
I know her better than you.

35:56.032 --> 35:59.032
And... and what did you find out?

35:59.740 --> 36:02.740
Everything you should have.

36:06.652 --> 36:09.652
You couldn't let me have a friend.

36:12.284 --> 36:15.284
You couldn't even let me have
a lover.

36:17.724 --> 36:20.724
She doesn't love you.

36:20.924 --> 36:23.924
Caden! Caden!

36:25.468 --> 36:28.132
Are you OK? Jesus!

36:28.156 --> 36:31.156
What were you doing?

36:38.908 --> 36:40.932
Caden!

36:40.956 --> 36:42.660
I tried to make you great.

36:42.684 --> 36:44.388
I'm not trying any more.

36:44.412 --> 36:46.180
You were angry when I tried.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.204
You're angry when I don't.
You're just an angry, angry boy!

36:49.916 --> 36:52.916
Tell Mum how you tried.
Tell me what?

36:55.228 --> 36:58.228
Tell Mum how you tried to make me
a man.

37:00.860 --> 37:03.652
What are you talking about?

37:03.676 --> 37:06.088
Tell her...

37:06.112 --> 37:08.068
...about your lessons.

37:08.092 --> 37:11.092
You don't have to do this.

37:11.548 --> 37:14.548
All you do is print
other people's secrets!

37:14.876 --> 37:17.476
And you expect me to keep yours!

37:17.500 --> 37:19.524
No, no secret, no.

37:19.548 --> 37:22.340
A bond, a father and a son.

37:22.364 --> 37:25.364
A bond. What lessons?

37:26.844 --> 37:29.844
What are you talking about?

37:30.684 --> 37:33.684
He divorced you...

37:34.460 --> 37:37.460
...so he could teach me...
his lessons.

37:40.732 --> 37:43.732
The same lessons
his father taught him.

37:44.636 --> 37:47.636
How to be a man.

37:48.604 --> 37:51.604
How to succeed in this world.

37:55.772 --> 37:58.772
He divorced you
to get you out of the way.

38:01.084 --> 38:04.084
It had nothing to do with...

38:14.908 --> 38:17.060
It had nothing to do with what?

38:17.084 --> 38:20.084
It had nothing
to do with losing the baby.

38:22.588 --> 38:25.588
He was always planned to get you
out of the way.

38:29.820 --> 38:32.820
Max, I need you to explain

38:33.724 --> 38:36.724
what was just said.

38:37.116 --> 38:40.116
I need you to explain what my son is
talking about.

38:43.132 --> 38:46.132
What lessons?

38:50.940 --> 38:53.940
What is it?

39:05.916 --> 39:08.916
"A report on the future of steel
by Maximilian Finch."

39:11.676 --> 39:14.660
I didn't ask this of you.
No, I thought it prudent.

39:14.684 --> 39:17.684
You... thought it prudent.

39:17.948 --> 39:20.948
Sir, today the US steel industry
employs 350,000 workers.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.324
When I was born, it employed...

39:24.348 --> 39:27.348
When you were squeezed out,
pushed out, rejected.

39:29.532 --> 39:32.532
Birth is a form of rejection,
is it not?

39:33.308 --> 39:36.308
When I was born, it employed
over 550,000.

39:36.636 --> 39:39.636
"Steel production in the United
States is set to drop by half."

39:42.716 --> 39:44.484
Says who? You? Yes, sir.

39:44.508 --> 39:47.508
"Capital investment in Finch's
Factories has remained at 2%."

39:50.268 --> 39:51.780
We spend only to patch them up.

39:51.804 --> 39:54.804
But for the past 20 years,
the Japanese have been building

39:55.132 --> 39:58.132
new plants, new furnaces,
energy efficient, faster, cheaper.

39:59.356 --> 40:02.356
"Today Japan produces 136 tonnes of
steel for 1,000 man hours."

40:07.164 --> 40:08.488
Is that so?

40:08.512 --> 40:11.108
At our factories,
we produce 96 tonnes.

40:11.132 --> 40:14.132
40 tonnes less. Yes, and it's not
the men, sir, they're good men -

40:14.588 --> 40:16.804
it's their tools,
it's the equipment.

40:16.828 --> 40:19.428
Well, if it isn't the men,
who is it?

40:19.452 --> 40:20.900
Well, sir, it's us.

40:20.924 --> 40:23.924
You mean, I think,
more accurately...

40:26.684 --> 40:29.684
...that it is me.

40:31.868 --> 40:34.340
US Steel are diversifying
out of steel.

40:34.364 --> 40:36.516
My source at the company tells me

40:36.540 --> 40:39.076
they're moving into real estate,
chemicals and oil.

40:39.100 --> 40:42.100
They're planning to buy Marathon Oil
for $4 billion.

40:42.236 --> 40:44.900
Their long-term ambition is for only
a third of their profits

40:44.924 --> 40:47.924
coming from steel. Your mother...

40:53.244 --> 40:56.244
She passed away.

41:02.332 --> 41:03.972
When did she pass, sir?

41:03.996 --> 41:06.996
One month ago.

41:07.836 --> 41:09.476
A month?

41:09.500 --> 41:12.500
More like two.

41:13.148 --> 41:15.688
And...

41:15.712 --> 41:17.608
...the funeral?

41:17.632 --> 41:20.632
A small affair.

41:21.852 --> 41:24.852
Who attended, sir?
I was there. No-one else.

41:27.484 --> 41:30.484
She'd no family, no friends,
no loved ones.

41:34.844 --> 41:37.844
How was the service, sir?

41:38.108 --> 41:41.108
Quiet.

41:41.756 --> 41:43.780
Dignified.

41:43.804 --> 41:46.340
I was profoundly moved by it.

41:46.364 --> 41:49.364
She's at peace now,
peace she never found in life,

41:51.484 --> 41:54.484
and quite frankly, it's a relief.

42:30.908 --> 42:33.908
Do not stand at my grave and cry.

42:35.196 --> 42:37.284
I am not there

42:37.308 --> 42:40.036
I did not die.

42:40.060 --> 42:43.060
Do not stand at my grave and cry.

43:56.284 --> 43:59.204
Help...

43:59.228 --> 44:02.228
Help...

45:21.916 --> 45:24.916
You know the rest.
Bought my first newspaper and...

45:27.232 --> 45:30.232
...built my life.

45:32.348 --> 45:35.348
You were abused, physically,
mentally.

45:38.364 --> 45:41.364
It was abuse,
and your mother would've stopped it.

45:45.532 --> 45:48.388
My mother?

45:48.412 --> 45:51.412
My mo...

45:51.804 --> 45:54.532
Mother couldn't take care
of herself.

45:54.556 --> 45:57.556
Did it ever cross your mind
that maybe he was lying?

45:59.356 --> 46:02.356
Maybe she never tried to kill you?
Maybe she loved you?

46:03.452 --> 46:05.412
That's why he got her
out of the way?

46:05.436 --> 46:06.884
Because she loved you,

46:06.908 --> 46:08.804
because she would've protected you?

46:08.828 --> 46:11.828
Because no mother would've let
that happen to her child.

46:11.964 --> 46:14.180
No. No.

46:14.204 --> 46:17.204
That's not right, I...

46:18.812 --> 46:21.812
After my father died, I went to my
mother's hospital. It wasn't a lie.

46:24.124 --> 46:27.124
That he had her committed?
Oh, no, I don't doubt it.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.900
That's what powerful men did
when they wanted women out the way.

46:31.996 --> 46:34.996
He was one of the most powerful men
in the state.

46:35.068 --> 46:38.068
She was a dancer from a club.

46:38.460 --> 46:41.460
What chance did she have?

46:44.796 --> 46:47.796
What chance did I have?

46:49.468 --> 46:51.108
You see everyone.

46:51.132 --> 46:54.132
But you don't see him.

46:57.404 --> 47:00.404
You watched your father die?

47:04.252 --> 47:07.252
That's what you said.

47:15.388 --> 47:18.388
You looked him in the eyes...
as close as we're standing now?

47:21.980 --> 47:24.980
Closer.

47:32.156 --> 47:35.156
All that... pain.

47:38.684 --> 47:41.684
What would I have done?

47:43.228 --> 47:46.228
You did more than watch, Dad.

47:47.132 --> 47:50.132
You made sure.

47:52.828 --> 47:55.300
Why would I save him?
Why would I do that?

47:55.324 --> 47:57.604
He wouldn't have saved that man.

47:57.628 --> 47:59.396
It was an opportunity.

47:59.420 --> 48:02.420
A business opportunity, to be free.

48:02.556 --> 48:04.324
And I took it,

48:04.348 --> 48:06.692
as he taught me.

48:06.716 --> 48:09.716
It took steel to do that.

48:10.748 --> 48:13.748
You've been wanting to tell that
story your whole life, haven't you?

48:18.236 --> 48:20.260
I'm so sorry.

48:20.284 --> 48:23.284
The pain I caused you. But
I protected you from some of it too.

48:31.228 --> 48:34.020
All I wanted...

48:34.044 --> 48:37.044
...was for us to be like this.

48:43.580 --> 48:46.580
Why couldn't we be like this?

48:53.756 --> 48:56.756
Why can't we be like this?

48:57.724 --> 49:00.724
The lessons he taught you...

49:03.612 --> 49:06.612
YOUR father's lessons?

49:09.628 --> 49:12.628
No.

49:13.724 --> 49:16.724
You were never your father to me.

49:17.692 --> 49:19.588
I censored his lessons.

49:19.612 --> 49:22.612
I tried to teach you those ideas
without his cruelty.

49:25.948 --> 49:28.948
I compromised,
because I cared about you so much.

49:30.172 --> 49:32.388
The lessons failed.

49:32.412 --> 49:35.412
You needed cruelty - cruelty was
why those lessons worked.

49:36.828 --> 49:39.828
Cruelty was the whole point.

49:41.372 --> 49:44.372
You look at this family
and you think cruelty's missing?

49:44.572 --> 49:47.572
It never crossed my mind to pity
you, but right now, I do.

49:49.436 --> 49:52.436
I pity you
because you never stood a chance.

49:56.796 --> 49:59.796
A chance for what?

50:00.316 --> 50:03.316
Being a father.

50:06.332 --> 50:09.332
What do you know
about being a father?

50:09.788 --> 50:12.788
What do you know? You know nothing.
I hated my father.

50:12.860 --> 50:15.460
He was a monster, but he was right.

50:15.484 --> 50:18.484
About this world,
about how to succeed.

50:18.748 --> 50:21.748
Have you ever...? How many men
are like me in this world?

50:23.420 --> 50:26.420
I'm sorry,
I wanted you to be the same.

50:28.476 --> 50:31.476
Did you make him fire people?

50:32.512 --> 50:34.148
Did you hire prostitutes?

50:34.172 --> 50:37.172
He was 17,
he was not a child any more.

50:37.692 --> 50:40.692
He learned how to... how to be safe,
how to be careful.

50:40.956 --> 50:43.300
So you taught him how to fight

50:43.324 --> 50:45.092
and fire and fuck.

50:45.116 --> 50:46.948
I taught him how to succeed.Please.

50:46.972 --> 50:49.380
Mum and Dad, I don't want us to
fight any more!

50:49.404 --> 50:52.132
Oh, I'm not just fighting your
father. I'm fighting his father.

50:52.156 --> 50:55.076
I'm fighting
all these fucking fathers.

50:55.100 --> 50:58.100
Just let him go.

50:59.964 --> 51:02.564
I hated him.Yes.He was cruel.

51:02.588 --> 51:05.588
But he was right.

51:06.112 --> 51:08.452
He wasn't kind. He wasn't gentle.
I'm coming after you,

51:08.476 --> 51:10.436
not because of what was done
to my son

51:10.460 --> 51:12.612
or because of what was done to you.

51:12.636 --> 51:15.636
It's not gentle.
Because it keeps on being done.

51:15.772 --> 51:17.284
It is the way.

51:17.308 --> 51:20.308
Then let's find another.

51:22.492 --> 51:25.492
I came up here
to tell you we shouldn't talk,

51:25.564 --> 51:28.036
because I could see where
this would end. Now here we are!

51:28.060 --> 51:31.044
After everything I told you,
you still want to come after me?

51:31.068 --> 51:33.860
Oh, I'm coming after you
because of everything you told me.

51:33.884 --> 51:36.740
Be careful. Be very careful.

51:36.764 --> 51:39.764
Kathryn, ask yourself, is this a man
I want on my side

51:40.284 --> 51:41.988
or a man I want to fight with?

51:42.012 --> 51:45.012
This is your father talking.

51:45.660 --> 51:48.452
You'll become a threat,
like any other threat.

51:48.476 --> 51:51.476
Your father. And I deal with threats
all day long.

51:51.996 --> 51:54.996
How many threats do you deal with?
None like you.

51:55.388 --> 51:58.388
And the people you care about?
Orla? Scott?

51:59.164 --> 52:02.020
How hard will it be to break them?
Listen to yourself!

52:02.044 --> 52:05.044
If you hurt them, if you
so much as utter her name again,

52:06.780 --> 52:09.780
I will spread your most damaging
secrets all over the fucking news.

52:17.152 --> 52:19.172
Caden...

52:19.196 --> 52:22.196
...for the first time,
you sound like a man.

52:35.580 --> 52:38.580
Max.

52:41.596 --> 52:44.596
Max?

52:44.860 --> 52:46.244
There's a news story.

52:46.268 --> 52:49.268
Right now, I want to ask,
would you run it or not?

52:53.308 --> 52:56.164
What's the story?

52:56.188 --> 52:59.188
You met the Prime Minister,
both of you, and his son, Saif.

53:00.028 --> 53:02.244
Long time ago. Saif was a boy.

53:02.268 --> 53:04.420
Yeah, well, he's at Cambridge now.

53:04.444 --> 53:06.276
Studying to be a doctor.

53:06.300 --> 53:09.156
Yeah. Smart kid. Good kid.

53:09.180 --> 53:12.180
There was a time
when he was struggling.

53:13.792 --> 53:16.792
What, he started drinking?

53:17.632 --> 53:20.632
One night, drunk, the son
of the first Muslim Prime Minister

53:23.196 --> 53:26.196
of the United Kingdom started
browsing fanatical Islamic websites.

53:30.172 --> 53:33.172
In 10 Downing Street.

53:34.268 --> 53:37.268
So, why? Why would the son do that?

53:37.404 --> 53:40.404
Did he suddenly decide to become
a terrorist? No, of course not.

53:41.756 --> 53:44.228
No. The son did it because he knew

53:44.252 --> 53:47.108
how damaging it would be
to his father,

53:47.132 --> 53:50.132
how it could bring down
his father's career.

53:51.804 --> 53:54.804
The son knew.

53:57.052 --> 54:00.052
Here's my question -
would you run that story?

54:03.388 --> 54:06.388
Nope.

54:07.356 --> 54:10.356
Caden?

54:12.988 --> 54:15.988
The son made a mistake.

54:20.476 --> 54:23.476
Yes, he did.

54:35.452 --> 54:37.092
Max, listen to me.

54:37.116 --> 54:38.884
I'm always listening.

54:38.908 --> 54:41.908
You can't print that story.

54:43.132 --> 54:45.220
It's not my world.

54:45.244 --> 54:48.244
I don't shape it, it shapes me.

54:48.380 --> 54:50.212
I don't run it, it runs me.

54:50.236 --> 54:53.236
If it wasn't me,
it would be someone else like me...

54:54.780 --> 54:57.780
...but it won't ever be
anyone like you.

55:00.924 --> 55:03.924
Max...

55:04.508 --> 55:07.508
I WOULD run the story about you.

55:37.404 --> 55:40.404
Therefore we are buried with him
by baptism into death,

55:42.524 --> 55:45.524
that like as Christ was raised up
from the dead

55:45.596 --> 55:47.940
by the glory of the Father,

55:47.964 --> 55:50.964
even so we, also,
should walk in newness of life,

55:53.148 --> 55:56.148
for if we have been
planted together

55:56.348 --> 55:58.436
in the likeness of his death,

55:58.460 --> 56:01.460
we shall be also
in the likeness of his resurrection.

56:10.108 --> 56:13.108
My father was a great man.
