WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:17.350 --> 00:18.476
You're kidding me.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.062
She bet 25 million yen on a pig?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.148
That's right.

00:23.231 --> 00:27.819
Yumeko's win in turn three was so obvious
I figured you'd catch on.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.030
It was painful for me too.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.534
What makes you think you've won?
You've only beat me for one round.

00:34.617 --> 00:40.498
As long as I've got something to bet,
I'll never lose to a moron like you.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.875
What did you say?

00:42.459 --> 00:46.421
I shouldn't need to say this,
but violence is strictly forbidden.

00:48.673 --> 00:53.344
- Saotome, please don't provoke him.
- Right.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.514
On to turn five, then.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.268
<i>Stupid house pet.
I'll take everything you've got.</i>

01:00.351 --> 01:02.312
I'm betting one Kiwatari chip.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.395
Call...

01:04.480 --> 01:05.732
I mean, fold.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.943
Raise. Four Kiwatari chips.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.447
<i>No, wait. This is a bluff.</i>

01:13.031 --> 01:15.992
Call. One Kiwatari chip,
two Tsubomi chips.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.245
Reveal your hands, then.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.164
Pig. Seven and nine.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.750
<i>If she was bluffing, I should win.</i>

01:23.833 --> 01:27.587
<i>- She's...</i>
- A suit with two and five.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.219
Bet. Three Kiwatari chips.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.222
<i>Another high-stakes bet?</i>

01:39.057 --> 01:40.391
<i>I've got a pig.</i>

01:40.850 --> 01:42.435
<i>I can't risk it.</i>

01:43.019 --> 01:44.019
Fold.

01:45.146 --> 01:49.317
- Lucky me! I had a pig and still won!
- What?

01:50.318 --> 01:51.694
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:56.032
<i>This goes way beyond being good
at reading expressions or bluffing.</i>

01:57.325 --> 01:58.243
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

01:58.326 --> 02:03.206
You finally noticed?
You know, you really are dumb.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.289
Tsubomi,

02:04.707 --> 02:09.419
I imagine Kiwatari is telling you
to do this, but you should stop.

02:09.878 --> 02:15.593
Changing the position of your card
to tell him he has a suit is too obvious.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.472
From what you've done so far,
straight means spade.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.933
Slight right means club.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.309
Left means diamond.

02:23.893 --> 02:27.605
And if you put it down and slide it,
it's a heart.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.526
What was this about
how house pets can't fool humans?

02:32.068 --> 02:35.113
What you're doing is even more obvious.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.491
I know for a fact
that in Year Two, Camellia Class,

02:38.575 --> 02:45.373
Nanami Tsubomi
is your group's personal plaything.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.252
When the teams were announced,
I got a little worried.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.213
I knew you two would be working together.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.131
So...

02:55.008 --> 02:58.011
I decided to have Yumeko help me.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:36.901 --> 04:38.736
I think you let your guard down.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.532
When you checked the card,
you let your emotions show.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.328
Don't you feel bad for Tsubomi,
having such an idiot for a master?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.788
Shut up.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.041
Tsubomi, I'll show you
a better way to do it.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.877
You put your hands under the desk

04:54.961 --> 04:58.089
and use your fingers
to tell each other your cards.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.841
That's much safer.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.264
Why, you little...

05:06.347 --> 05:10.935
It seems that everyone is cheating
in some manner.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.730
Now, how to deal with this...

05:14.063 --> 05:15.231
Igarashi,

05:15.315 --> 05:19.694
I'm not saying anything
about Kiwatari and Tsubomi's cheating.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.281
If I don't, there's no reason
to stop us, right?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.364
I see.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.577
So, you want to enjoy a game
with cheating?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.287
Is that right?

05:29.871 --> 05:33.833
I think this game is more fun
with cheating.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.795
Oh, are you not good at games
where you trick each other, Kiwatari?

05:37.879 --> 05:41.049
You were basically telling us
what was in your hand, right?

05:41.632 --> 05:43.259
Fine.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.470
Let's keep going.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.057
This is getting interesting.

05:49.515 --> 05:53.478
Everyone knows exactly
what's in their hand.

05:54.062 --> 05:58.775
This game is now
just a big series of bluffs!

05:59.484 --> 06:00.568
Very well.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.111
I'm resuming the game.

06:03.696 --> 06:04.696
DEBT - 310 MILLION YEN

06:05.573 --> 06:11.120
<i>This table is covered with lies.
And the best liar will win the victory.</i>

06:12.121 --> 06:13.623
<i>A seven, eight suit...</i>

06:13.706 --> 06:15.750
Tsubomi, you play.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.833
Okay!

06:16.876 --> 06:19.837
- Call...
- No, you idiot, raise!

06:19.921 --> 06:21.964
Use your head!

06:22.048 --> 06:23.508
You're the idiot.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.762
Even if you have a good hand,
why are you telling us?

06:27.845 --> 06:29.514
- Fold.
- Fold.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.225
Why...?

06:34.060 --> 06:37.230
<i>Shit. She's slowing me down.</i>

06:37.814 --> 06:42.110
<i>Yumeko is in the lead.
I took on debt to be here.</i>

06:42.193 --> 06:48.616
<i>If I don't win, the debt will be real
and I'll be a house pet. Me, a house pet?</i>

06:48.699 --> 06:52.829
<i>Impossible. I'm an owner, not a pet.
I'll make them understand.</i>

06:53.496 --> 06:55.414
Call. One Saotome chip.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.711
If you're going for it,
you must have confidence in your hand.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.840
Just kidding!

07:03.923 --> 07:07.844
If you were really confident,
you'd be betting one of Jabami's chips!

07:08.427 --> 07:10.096
Too bad!

07:10.179 --> 07:12.140
<i>A pair? Now?</i>

07:12.640 --> 07:16.894
<i>What the hell is going on here?
Why is this happening to me?</i>

07:17.728 --> 07:19.647
Now, moving on to turn nine...

07:23.484 --> 07:26.696
<i>I have two turns left
and I'm in third place.</i>

07:26.779 --> 07:30.408
<i>If this doesn't change,
I'll end up with 50 million in debt!</i>

07:30.992 --> 07:32.285
- Tsubomi!
- Yes?

07:32.368 --> 07:33.953
Bet a Jabami chip!

07:35.121 --> 07:35.955
But...

07:36.038 --> 07:37.707
Shut up and do it!

07:37.790 --> 07:39.709
Give me your chip!

07:39.792 --> 07:44.046
You keep screwing things up,
so be useful for once!

07:44.505 --> 07:45.505
Okay.

07:46.799 --> 07:50.553
Call. One Jabami Chip.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.097
Call. One Kiwatari chip.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.557
Fold.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.226
<i>Yumeko, you must have a good hand.</i>

07:57.685 --> 08:00.062
<i>But I won't drop out here.</i>

08:00.146 --> 08:04.400
<i>Once I have Tsubomi's chip,
I'm almost certain to get first place.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:09.071
<i>There's no bluffing here. This is just
a pure bet on the cards themselves!</i>

08:09.655 --> 08:11.574
Please reveal your hands.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.078
A seven, five suit.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.581
A six, two suit.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.165
What?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.010
I won!

08:31.093 --> 08:34.222
I have 5 Jabami chips or 155 million yen!

08:34.304 --> 08:38.476
First place is mine! That's what you get.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.727
Starting tomorrow,
I'll make your lives hell.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.149
You don't know how
the game will end until it's over.

08:46.651 --> 08:51.030
Moving on to turn ten.
For better or for worse, this is the end.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.408
Everyone, make sure you don't regret this.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.619
It's over already?

08:56.702 --> 08:59.914
It feels like time went so fast.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.916
I could keep playing forever.

09:01.999 --> 09:06.003
I'm tired of this.
Let's just finish this up.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.507
<i>What? Why are they so calm?</i>

09:09.590 --> 09:13.261
<i>I'm folding this turn,
so first place is mine for sure.</i>

09:14.637 --> 09:16.222
<i>No, wait...</i>

09:16.305 --> 09:19.517
<i>There's an easy way for them
to get first place.</i>

09:20.017 --> 09:24.772
<i>For instance, Yumeko could make Saotome
bet all her Jabami chips and win,</i>

09:24.855 --> 09:26.357
<i>or the other way around.</i>

09:26.440 --> 09:30.736
<i>What do I do? How do I do this?
No, there's only one way.</i>

09:30.820 --> 09:36.492
<i>The only way to stop them is for me
or Tsubomi to win. I can win this.</i>

09:42.081 --> 09:47.420
<i>Tsubomi has a pair of nines?
This time I win for sure.</i>

09:48.212 --> 09:50.256
Bet. One Saotome chip.

09:56.929 --> 10:02.768
<i>Think carefully. Whether you bet or not,
you're going to be at least third place!</i>

10:02.852 --> 10:04.854
Call. One Jabami chip.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.690
<i>One Jabami chip?</i>

10:08.274 --> 10:09.775
What are you doing?

10:09.859 --> 10:15.031
- All we had to do is keep quiet.
- Isn't it kind of irritating right now?

10:15.740 --> 10:18.242
I'm betting on Tsubomi winning.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.579
Won't you help me?

10:22.455 --> 10:25.499
- Why would I do that?
<i>- What are they talking about?</i>

10:26.834 --> 10:32.006
Fine! I'll play along
with this stupid game of yours.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.133
Raise. Three Jabami chips.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.385
<i>Five Jabami chips.</i>

10:36.469 --> 10:39.388
<i>If Tsubomi wins, she gets 170 million?</i>

10:40.181 --> 10:42.516
<i>She'll have more than me!</i>

10:43.726 --> 10:45.227
Fold, Tsubomi!

10:45.311 --> 10:48.481
I'll never let you beat me!

10:48.564 --> 10:49.732
Fold!

10:52.360 --> 10:53.194
Okay.

10:53.277 --> 10:57.281
Tsubomi, is it okay
to let him keep abusing you?

10:57.948 --> 11:03.579
Are you just telling yourself
you have to endure it until graduation?

11:05.039 --> 11:07.458
That way of thinking is wrong.

11:08.125 --> 11:12.963
If a person doesn't fight
against injustice, nothing will change.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.549
You'll be house pet your whole life.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.302
Will you live your life
with your head down forever?

11:18.886 --> 11:21.013
Tsubomi, fold, damn it!

11:21.597 --> 11:25.226
Maybe normally you have to obey
the school's rules.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.523
But you've got a chance to fight back.
If you don't take it...

11:31.190 --> 11:35.152
you're like a pig who refuses
to walk through an open cage door.

11:35.236 --> 11:39.115
You're proving to everyone
that you're really a house pet.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.908
I...

11:42.034 --> 11:45.788
Or is that how you want to live your life?

11:46.288 --> 11:48.332
You're too scared to fight back.

11:48.916 --> 11:53.129
You'd rather suck up to him,
so he'll be a little nicer to you.

11:54.004 --> 12:00.845
I see. That may be one way to live,
though it's one I can't understand at all.

12:01.429 --> 12:07.476
Then you should get out fast,
before you make Kiwatari madder, right?

12:08.102 --> 12:12.106
Right? Tsubomi, the permanent house pet?

12:16.277 --> 12:19.321
Shut up!

12:19.405 --> 12:21.991
You don't know anything!

12:22.575 --> 12:23.575
You don't...

12:24.034 --> 12:25.744
<i>Wow, it's so pretty!</i>

12:25.828 --> 12:27.371
<i>It's amazing!</i>

12:27.455 --> 12:28.789
I'm so jealous.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.000
Right? It's so silky smooth.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.210
Like a doll's.

12:33.294 --> 12:38.340
- How long have you been growing it?
- Since I was in elementary school.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.301
It really is pretty.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.220
<i>Mittens!</i>

12:48.350 --> 12:52.188
No! Stop it!

12:52.897 --> 12:57.485
Calm down. We're not going to hurt you.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.364
We're just gonna give you a little trim.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.036
No!

13:10.164 --> 13:15.169
Why?

13:16.545 --> 13:18.714
Why are you doing something so awful?

13:19.757 --> 13:23.427
I always wanted to cut your long hair.

13:23.511 --> 13:27.598
Doesn't it feel good when you cut nails
that have gotten too long?

13:27.681 --> 13:29.183
It's the same thing!

13:29.266 --> 13:31.769
<i>The threads that held me up snapped.</i>

13:32.353 --> 13:33.353
<i>After that,</i>

13:34.063 --> 13:36.482
<i>to keep myself sane,</i>

13:37.274 --> 13:40.194
<i>I kept my feelings locked up inside me.</i>

13:41.862 --> 13:45.533
<i>But... today, right now,
things are different.</i>

13:46.700 --> 13:51.580
<i>With one choice,
I can make him suffer a terrible loss.</i>

13:52.414 --> 13:54.583
<i>The feelings I locked up are returning.</i>

13:55.417 --> 13:58.837
<i>The fear I felt that day, the loss,
the rage, the frustration...</i>

13:58.921 --> 14:00.965
<i>the desire for... revenge!</i>

14:04.552 --> 14:05.552
I...

14:06.387 --> 14:07.387
I'm...

14:08.639 --> 14:10.307
I'm not a house pet!

14:10.766 --> 14:13.018
I'm a human!

14:13.102 --> 14:14.937
THE GIRL WHO BECAME HUMAN

14:15.729 --> 14:16.897
Call!

14:18.691 --> 14:20.025
Tsubomi!

14:20.609 --> 14:24.280
I believe I asked you
to refrain from violence.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.285
You're going to regret this later.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.625
<i>This is certainly a surprise.</i>

14:36.709 --> 14:39.389
<i>As usual, everything the student council
president said was correct.</i>

14:40.045 --> 14:43.382
<i>Yumeko Jabami is insane.
Sanity will get you nowhere with her.</i>

14:44.091 --> 14:46.802
<i>Is she crazy?</i>

14:46.886 --> 14:49.179
<i>What's the point of making Tsubomi win?</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:52.182
<i>Wait, maybe there is no point.</i>

14:52.266 --> 14:56.312
<i>Maybe Yumeko's got a hand
that can't lose. A pair of tens.</i>

14:57.271 --> 14:58.355
<i>No way.</i>

14:58.439 --> 15:01.191
Please reveal your hands.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.030
It's kind of a shame to think it's over.

15:11.327 --> 15:15.748
- A two, ten. Pig.
- A pair of nines.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.752
Oh, my!
What a great hand for the last round.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.670
Congratulations!

15:22.338 --> 15:26.258
<i>She's insane.
How much did she bet on a pig?</i>

15:27.343 --> 15:30.262
<i>If I'm second place.
I'm out 10 million yen.</i>

15:30.346 --> 15:33.682
<i>Well, that doesn't matter.
I can get that amount of money.</i>

15:33.766 --> 15:38.270
<i>The bigger problem is the fact
that she disobeyed me.</i>

15:38.854 --> 15:43.651
<i>I'll make sure she never fights back.</i>

15:44.234 --> 15:45.986
Congratulations, everyone.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.197
All ten turns are complete.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.158
I will now announce the results.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.993
The winner...

15:53.619 --> 15:55.663
is Mary Saotome,

15:55.746 --> 15:59.041
with 166 million yen.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.044
Second place is Nanami Tsubomi,
with 92 million yen.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.003
Hey, wait!

16:03.087 --> 16:04.922
Third place is Yumeko Jabami...

16:05.005 --> 16:06.882
- Hey!
- ...with 74 million yen.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.177
- Fourth place is Jun Kiwatari...
- Wait! You're getting this wrong!

16:10.928 --> 16:13.931
You're not making a damn bit of sense!

16:14.598 --> 16:16.225
The results are correct.

16:16.308 --> 16:20.187
Like hell they are!
I've got five Jabami chips!

16:20.270 --> 16:23.941
That's way above 58 million on its own!

16:27.945 --> 16:31.365
Saotome, it's rude to laugh too much.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.038
I didn't think it would work so well!

16:38.122 --> 16:42.626
Part of it was luck, but a lot of it
was thanks to your acting!

16:42.710 --> 16:44.294
Yeah? Thanks!

16:45.796 --> 16:49.508
You still didn't figure it out?
Do the math.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.428
Two sets of chips
have their values swapped, right?

16:53.762 --> 16:54.762
The chips?

16:55.806 --> 16:56.974
JABAMI

16:57.057 --> 16:58.809
God, you're slow at math.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.228
All right, I'll tell you.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.023
Yumeko's and mine are switched.

17:05.773 --> 17:10.904
Yumeko's chips are worth 5 million yen,
and mine are worth 310 million.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.406
See? The math works, right?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.035
Don't be stupid. You can't just...

17:16.617 --> 17:20.914
It was in the rules, right?
You can write your own amount of debt.

17:21.582 --> 17:26.837
In other words, Yumeko only reported
5 million of her 310 million yen debt.

17:27.588 --> 17:33.552
And I have 50 million in debt,
but I reported it as 310 million.

17:33.635 --> 17:38.766
You said on your application that you took
10 million from a friend, right?

17:39.349 --> 17:42.144
We did the same thing.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.521
You weren't the only liar.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.692
An acquaintance of mine
should be getting the money now.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.987
Suzui, message from the student council.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.284
What the hell is this?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.412
<i>The rest was simple.</i>

18:00.829 --> 18:03.540
<i>I received a board
that read "310 million yen,"</i>

18:03.624 --> 18:06.085
<i>and Yumeko got one
that said "50 million."</i>

18:06.168 --> 18:08.504
<i>So, we just switched.</i>

18:09.088 --> 18:11.006
<i>And then, how strange...</i>

18:12.758 --> 18:16.512
The values of our chips were switched.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.016
I can't believe you fell for it so easily!

18:21.100 --> 18:22.601
This is stupid!

18:22.684 --> 18:25.270
Hey, this is against the rules, right?

18:25.354 --> 18:29.525
There's no rule that says you must place
your own board in front of you.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.195
That's insane! It's 260 million yen!

18:33.278 --> 18:35.364
What's in it for the student council,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.658
accepting a fake application
with an amount like that?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.786
That's none of your business.

18:41.870 --> 18:46.792
Kiwatari, it's a mistake to judge things
only by your own standards.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.420
Every person is different.

18:50.504 --> 18:54.258
There are some things they can forgive
and some things they can't.

18:54.842 --> 19:00.347
No one will ever obey you 100 percent.
That's what makes it so great, right?

19:00.430 --> 19:03.892
Shut up! I refuse to accept this!

19:03.976 --> 19:05.936
Your permission is unnecessary.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.231
We're simply recording the results
as they occurred.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.152
It's your fault for being stupid enough
to get tricked.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.404
You bitch!

19:26.665 --> 19:30.085
Violence is forbidden.
That's the third time you were told.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.840
More importantly, do you understand?

19:35.340 --> 19:40.429
You are now 310 million in debt
to the student council.

19:41.346 --> 19:45.893
If you can't pay it off...
you're going to be a house pet!

19:51.815 --> 19:54.610
That's the last of the paperwork.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.320
Thank you, everyone.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.615
It's all done.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.617
Oh, right.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.701
Tsubomi.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.788
Don't forget how you felt back there.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.754
<i>I only got second place.</i>

20:14.254 --> 20:18.300
<i>I'm still a house pet,
and I still owe 20 million yen.</i>

20:20.219 --> 20:21.553
I was fooled.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.182
<i>But I don't feel any anger.</i>

20:25.933 --> 20:28.185
<i>Yumeko gave me a chance.</i>

20:32.147 --> 20:36.193
So, that's how it happened.
Can I have that check back?

20:37.277 --> 20:40.656
<i>A small amount is one thing,
but that's 260 million yen.</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:43.200
<i>Suzui might start getting ideas.</i>

20:44.451 --> 20:48.705
So, that was it.
I thought it was a joke and got scared.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.708
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

20:51.792 --> 20:55.462
It's amazing that you could win
such a big gamble.

20:55.545 --> 20:59.341
- Congratulations, both of you.
<i>- It's almost hilarious how honest he is.</i>

21:00.175 --> 21:02.177
Okay, I'll be going.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.431
What?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.392
Thank you!

21:08.475 --> 21:12.271
Thanks to your help,
I was able to enjoy a stimulating game.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.358
Well, that goes for both of us.

21:17.025 --> 21:20.028
Now, get off me!
Where are you touching me?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.239
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:23.532 --> 21:28.870
Saotome, is it all right
if I call you Mary?

21:29.371 --> 21:32.082
We're friends now, right?

21:33.166 --> 21:35.085
Well, that's...

21:39.214 --> 21:41.133
That's fine, I guess.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.594
Thank you, Mary!

21:46.054 --> 21:47.514
- Get off me!
- Mary!

21:47.597 --> 21:51.184
<i>They're much friendlier than before.</i>

21:53.729 --> 21:56.606
<i>The game ended in the way we expected.</i>

21:57.149 --> 22:00.694
<i>It didn't matter to us, either way.</i>

22:01.445 --> 22:06.241
<i>Kiwatari is the son of a governor.
Yumeko is on our list of people to watch.</i>

22:06.908 --> 22:11.621
<i>We wanted one to defeat the other.</i>

22:12.372 --> 22:14.249
<i>So, the result was a success.</i>

22:14.833 --> 22:16.793
<i>But was this right?</i>

22:17.878 --> 22:22.299
<i>That last turn, Yumeko Jabami
volunteered to go to third place,</i>

22:22.382 --> 22:24.926
<i>taking a 30 million yen loss.</i>

22:25.844 --> 22:28.805
<i>Money doesn't drive her.</i>

22:29.556 --> 22:33.560
<i>The simplest way to control people
won't work on her.</i>

22:34.352 --> 22:35.352
<i>President...</i>

22:36.646 --> 22:41.818
<i>was it right to let go of her reins?</i>

24:19.583 --> 24:22.544
<i>You're refusing to rescind
Yumeko Jabami's life plan?</i>

24:22.627 --> 24:24.504
<i>Someone you could never understand...</i>

24:24.588 --> 24:29.384
<i>Don't worry about a thing. Let's just
enjoy ourselves as much as we can!</i>

24:29.467 --> 24:30.969
