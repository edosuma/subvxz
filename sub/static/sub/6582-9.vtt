'Previously on The Royals...'

00:01.706 --> 00:04.224
I came for the diamonds. I'm
taking them back to her.

00:04.838 --> 00:05.921
These are for you.

00:10.265 --> 00:12.749
Last time I saw you, I was in rehab.

00:12.834 --> 00:14.469
And you wouldn't share your drugs.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.711
Brandon Boone was a member of
Robert's military company.

00:18.242 --> 00:21.625
All I know is the Major who contacted
me is missing and I expect to be next.

00:21.810 --> 00:23.810
My brother didn't kill himself, did he?

00:23.879 --> 00:25.242
No. I'm the one that killed him.

00:25.514 --> 00:27.647
I won't be the girl waiting
for the guy to show.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.783
I would never be the
guy to stand you up.

00:29.851 --> 00:32.218
We may have more in
common than I realized.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.254
Maybe we can help each other.

00:34.322 --> 00:35.722
I want to have a drink.

00:35.791 --> 00:37.624
Good. Fresh pomegranate juice.

00:37.692 --> 00:40.560
(CYRUS) 'I loved Violet
and I always will.'

00:41.463 --> 00:44.280
You killed the wrong maid. Bitch.

00:45.634 --> 00:49.435
The night King Simon was attacked, what
time did he arrive back at the palace?

00:49.504 --> 00:52.622
(CYRUS) So it was Lucius, then.
Ted Pryce confirmed.

00:52.707 --> 00:55.074
That he killed Simon? He didn't.

00:55.143 --> 00:56.709
But he did kill Alistair.

00:56.778 --> 00:58.978
(DAPHNE) What's your
take on Jeffrey Stewart?

00:59.064 --> 01:01.548
That he might be an even
bigger sociopath than you?

01:01.616 --> 01:05.450
(TRUMAN) Dominique Stewart. She was
your father's true love. She died.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.087
- You killed her, didn't you?
- I did no such thing.

01:08.173 --> 01:10.456
- So you could be Queen.
- That's not true.

01:10.525 --> 01:12.375
- Admit you did it!
- I did it.

01:16.631 --> 01:18.364
'I did it.'

01:18.433 --> 01:20.283
Does any of it even matter?

01:21.770 --> 01:23.903
To Jeffrey Stewart, it does.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.507
It won't bring her back.

01:27.576 --> 01:30.143
It's not gonna bring me back.

01:30.212 --> 01:32.478
He'll just ruin his daughter's life.

01:32.547 --> 01:34.080
And so will you.

01:57.873 --> 01:59.472

01:59.541 --> 02:01.875
If Lucius was in the palace,
which clearly he was,

02:01.943 --> 02:03.543
he wouldn't have had time to leave,

02:03.612 --> 02:06.346
- attack the King and return.
- So why confess?

02:06.414 --> 02:07.847
Some people do it for notoriety.

02:07.883 --> 02:09.616
Others might be made to take the fall.

02:09.684 --> 02:12.151
Whatever the reason, there's
a bigger question to ask.

02:12.237 --> 02:13.753
If he didn't do it, who did?

02:13.838 --> 02:16.823
I've been through every frame
of footage from that evening.

02:16.892 --> 02:19.158
I even expanded the grid,
like we talked about.

02:19.227 --> 02:21.995
Eight and half million people and
not one of them saw anything.

02:22.063 --> 02:23.363
- It's impossible.
- I agree.

02:23.431 --> 02:25.698
There's no such thing
as a perfect crime.

02:26.334 --> 02:28.218
So we must be missing something.

02:30.572 --> 02:32.071
Jasper.

02:32.774 --> 02:34.841
I know I told you to
be great for Lenny.

02:35.777 --> 02:37.243
This is it.

02:38.246 --> 02:39.746
She hasn't...

02:39.814 --> 02:42.682
mentioned anything about the
birthday party, has she?

02:42.751 --> 02:45.051
If you're asking if
she's still with Mandy,

02:45.120 --> 02:46.386
the answer is no.

02:47.656 --> 02:49.322
Might be hope for you yet.

02:50.358 --> 02:52.091
Yeah. I don't think so.

02:54.729 --> 02:56.763
I'll let you know if I find anything.

What can I do for you, Rachel?

More discreet than that. Make the call.

04:05.467 --> 04:07.333
I was looking for
Princess Eleanor's room.

04:07.419 --> 04:09.502
Looks like the toilet in Trainspotting.

04:09.571 --> 04:13.039
I'll have you know, this is the first
time I've cleaned my own room ever.

04:13.429 --> 04:15.308
First boys, then drugs. Didn't you say?

04:15.377 --> 04:16.046
Indeed I did.

04:17.462 --> 04:19.678
And also girls.

04:19.731 --> 04:22.715
Obviously. But that's... a
whole other painful tale.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.283
It's a start.

04:24.352 --> 04:27.500

not getting dressed.

05:08.847 --> 05:11.197

- Please, have a seat.

06:52.033 --> 06:54.200
I need a favor.

06:54.252 --> 06:56.169
Okay.

07:01.209 --> 07:03.209
Please, have a seat. Wait.

07:03.294 --> 07:05.378
I need your weapon.

07:06.014 --> 07:08.047
Please, have a seat.

07:09.884 --> 07:11.634
I need to speak with you.

07:11.719 --> 07:13.719
In confidence.

07:18.443 --> 07:21.477
Please, take a seat.

07:21.563 --> 07:24.443
With all respect, ma'am,
I'd rather stand.

07:42.116 --> 07:44.717
(Clears throat) Excuse
me, Your Majesty.

07:44.786 --> 07:46.669
Can I be of any assistance?

07:46.754 --> 07:48.921
I plan to assemble this cot for my son.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.424
So bring me any tools I may require

07:51.492 --> 07:53.426
and keep my bourbon decanter full.

07:53.494 --> 07:55.444
Of course, Your Majesty.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.697
I'm at your service.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.512
Is there a problem, sir?

08:13.581 --> 08:15.815
Whatever it is you're
doing, it stops now.

08:15.883 --> 08:17.216
I don't follow.

08:17.285 --> 08:19.785
Accessing the surveillance database.

08:19.854 --> 08:22.622
I was gonna come to you, sir,
when I had something, eventually.

08:22.690 --> 08:25.024
- Regarding what?
- The King's murderer.

08:25.109 --> 08:27.059
The King's murderer is in prison.

08:27.128 --> 08:29.662
But it wasn't Lucius, sir.
He was in the palace.

08:29.731 --> 08:33.182
Mr. Frost, there are experts who
are paid to make this their work.

08:33.268 --> 08:35.400
Your work, however, is
to keep the Prince safe.

08:35.470 --> 08:38.037
What you're doing is not only
distracting, it's dangerous.

08:38.106 --> 08:39.922
More dangerous without my weapon.

08:40.008 --> 08:43.476
Oh, for the love of God, will you
stop it with the English accent?

08:47.649 --> 08:48.914
Look, son,

08:48.983 --> 08:53.035
there are decisions made
here every day without you.

08:53.121 --> 08:56.455
High-level, covert conversations.

08:56.524 --> 08:59.191
(American accent) If there is
something I should know...

08:59.260 --> 09:03.095
There's nothing you should know beyond
this. The King's murderer is in prison.

09:04.032 --> 09:06.582
I went out on a limb for you, Mr.
Frost.

09:07.251 --> 09:09.018
I gave you a second chance.

09:09.103 --> 09:10.870
And a first. And a third, as well.

09:16.044 --> 09:18.044
Let it go.

09:29.324 --> 09:31.757
I'm sure you're wondering
why I've asked you here.

09:31.826 --> 09:33.859
I assume it's because you
want to use me as a pawn

09:33.928 --> 09:36.012
in your quiet battle with
my mother and uncle.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.364
No. The people are upset.

09:38.433 --> 09:42.401
Our polls show a referendum to
abolish would pass in a landslide.

09:42.954 --> 09:44.670
When it does,

09:44.706 --> 09:47.039
what change will you be
able to affect then?

09:47.108 --> 09:48.874
Who said I wanted to change things?

09:48.960 --> 09:51.210
You did. On YouTube.

09:51.295 --> 09:52.912
Ten millions viewers.

09:52.980 --> 09:56.082
Now that was either an
incredibly savvy PR stunt

09:56.167 --> 09:58.634
or you were genuinely inspired

09:58.720 --> 10:00.152
and inspiring.

10:00.221 --> 10:02.254
It wasn't a PR stunt.

10:02.290 --> 10:05.474
I know you were in line for the throne.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.443
And I have to assume

10:07.528 --> 10:10.229
you wondered what type
of leader you'd be.

10:10.264 --> 10:13.332
Well, my instinct tells
me you'd be a great one.

10:13.401 --> 10:16.936
And I'm willing to give you
the chance to find out.

10:17.488 --> 10:19.038
What would I be doing, exactly?

10:19.123 --> 10:21.140
Well, I envision you

10:21.175 --> 10:25.411
as a kind of cultural
ambassador to young people.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.347
You could do a great deal here.

10:28.416 --> 10:30.316
We have the power,

10:30.385 --> 10:33.085
the influence and the relevancy
the monarchy once had.

10:34.555 --> 10:36.255
Will you at least consider it?

10:38.326 --> 10:39.625
Okay.

10:39.660 --> 10:40.826
Good.

10:40.912 --> 10:44.513
And, please, reach out if you
have any questions at all.

10:44.599 --> 10:46.932
Or if you simply want to get a drink.

10:47.001 --> 10:49.869
Lord knows, I need one some days.

10:49.937 --> 10:51.804
I know the feeling.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.640
I can see myself out.

10:56.577 --> 10:58.711
Oh, and, Liam, this position,

10:58.796 --> 11:01.380
it would be in New York.

11:01.449 --> 11:04.316
- In case that mattered.
- Good to know.

11:09.056 --> 11:10.890
I have some things to say to you

11:10.958 --> 11:14.176
and I thought it best I say
them directly and in person.

11:14.729 --> 11:17.663
Alistair Lacey is alive.

11:20.468 --> 11:23.302
So, while your intentions
were shameful...

11:24.872 --> 11:27.072
..it seems you're no murderer.

11:31.312 --> 11:34.480
And if shameless intentions
mattered around here,

11:34.549 --> 11:36.449
we'd all be in prison.

11:41.155 --> 11:43.806
You're going to be removed
from incarceration

11:43.891 --> 11:46.025
and absolved of any charges.

11:46.661 --> 11:48.711
And my position? My work?

11:48.796 --> 11:51.564
I can't forgive you for
betraying me, Lucius.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.266
I can't and I won't.

11:55.203 --> 11:57.720
Then, with all due
respect, Your Majesty...

11:58.739 --> 12:00.539
..I killed the King of England.

12:00.575 --> 12:04.310
And I will remain in
prison till my dying day.

12:04.395 --> 12:06.412
We're going to absolve
you of all charges.

12:06.447 --> 12:07.913
You will not!

12:08.499 --> 12:10.616
All the work we put into this,

12:10.685 --> 12:12.268
all the sacrifices we made...

12:12.353 --> 12:13.686
you made...

12:14.622 --> 12:17.756
..the monarchy cannot
overcome another scandal.

12:17.809 --> 12:20.409
We both know it.

12:20.495 --> 12:22.561
One more global disgrace

12:22.630 --> 12:25.030
and the people will vote to abolish.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.202
If they don't storm the gates and
burn the place down, instead.

12:30.805 --> 12:34.190
Lucius, you're in prison for
a crime you didn't commit.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.108
How could you want to protect this?

12:36.177 --> 12:37.776
Why would you care?

12:37.845 --> 12:39.645
Because it was my life.

12:39.714 --> 12:43.182
I was in league with
history and greatness,

12:43.251 --> 12:46.685
tethered to Edgar and Alfred The Great.

12:47.355 --> 12:49.855
1500 years of rule.

12:50.958 --> 12:53.459
I would rather remain in prison...

12:54.562 --> 12:56.629
..and see it all flourish,

12:56.697 --> 12:59.632
than be exonerated and see it burn.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.868
It's just a house, Lucius.

13:02.937 --> 13:04.220
No.

13:04.305 --> 13:07.273
It's a home. And it was my home.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.275
And you were my family.

13:10.278 --> 13:12.745
Cyrus is not fit to rule.

13:12.780 --> 13:14.363
Take it from him.

13:15.499 --> 13:17.416
He has an heir.

13:18.119 --> 13:19.952
A son.

13:22.206 --> 13:25.457
Cyrus told me to kill Alistair.

13:28.296 --> 13:30.296
Take it from him.

14:04.096 --> 14:06.346
You said there was
something that you needed.

14:06.431 --> 14:07.260
Right.

14:07.323 --> 14:09.432
Um, I was just wondering...

14:11.593 --> 14:13.143
Are you holding?

14:14.283 --> 14:16.797
Imogen, I... I thought you
said that you were clean.

14:16.865 --> 14:19.650
I just need a little something
to get me through the day.

14:19.735 --> 14:23.353
Viktor keeps me away from anyone or
anything that could help me out.

14:23.439 --> 14:24.488
So...

14:25.140 --> 14:27.174
- Can you?
- I can't.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.710
And I... I wouldn't.

14:29.778 --> 14:31.878
I'm sorry.

14:31.947 --> 14:33.080
Yeah.

14:33.148 --> 14:35.449
Hey, what's going on with you?

14:35.517 --> 14:39.853
This guy Viktor, he wasn't
very nice to you at the party.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.388
What's his story?

14:42.224 --> 14:44.458
He's just used to
getting what he wants.

14:44.526 --> 14:45.742
And?

14:45.828 --> 14:47.794
And... I mean...

14:48.497 --> 14:50.330
We stay in the finest hotels

14:50.399 --> 14:52.933
and go to palaces and parties
and places I could never see.

14:52.985 --> 14:54.117
So...

14:55.471 --> 14:57.671
that's why you need to get high,
because your life is so wonderful?

15:01.009 --> 15:03.810
What's behind me that's
got you all freaked out?

15:03.879 --> 15:05.696
Don't turn around, please.

15:05.781 --> 15:08.415
Just smile and laugh like
we're having a good time.

15:09.351 --> 15:11.818
I'm sorry, I have to go.

15:13.322 --> 15:16.423
But thank you. You really
are a good friend.

15:17.559 --> 15:19.659
(Posher accent) Ah, Dimitri.

15:19.695 --> 15:21.762
It's a pleasure to meet you.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.725
So what do you think
is going on with her?

15:34.810 --> 15:37.611
I don't know, Liam, but
she seemed so scared

15:37.679 --> 15:39.663
and there was nothing I could do.

15:39.748 --> 15:41.782
What did Holden say about this Viktor?

15:41.850 --> 15:43.734
Just said he's a bad guy.
Whatever that means.

15:44.937 --> 15:48.622
Len, I hate to pile it on,
but I've got some news.

15:49.591 --> 15:51.958
I picked the wrong day
to clean up my drugs.

15:52.961 --> 15:54.628
Lucius didn't kill Dad.

15:54.696 --> 15:56.229
What?

15:57.332 --> 15:59.666
- How do you know this?
- Jasper's investigating it.

15:59.701 --> 16:03.069
I know you have your issues with him, but
he's the only one I can count on lately.

16:03.138 --> 16:05.672
But you can't, Liam, and you shouldn't.

16:07.409 --> 16:09.459
You're sure it wasn't Lucius?

16:09.545 --> 16:10.844
- Yeah.
- Great.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.646
So the killer's still out there.

16:12.731 --> 16:16.483
Who the hell knows why Lucius confessed?
This place is unbelievable!

16:17.319 --> 16:19.669
You should have stayed in New York.

16:19.755 --> 16:21.171
About that...

16:26.261 --> 16:28.462
I got an offer to work
for the Deputy PM.

16:33.268 --> 16:35.235
It's in New York.

16:37.239 --> 16:39.606
I remember the moment
that you came in here

16:39.675 --> 16:41.842
and you told me you were
getting out with Ophelia.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.343
The day Dad died.

16:43.412 --> 16:44.861
I was happy for you, Liam,

16:44.947 --> 16:46.930
that you might be free from this place.

16:47.733 --> 16:49.616
And as much as I will miss you...

16:50.452 --> 16:52.502
..and I will...

16:52.588 --> 16:54.638
if I were you, I would take that offer

16:54.723 --> 16:56.323
and don't look back.

16:56.358 --> 16:58.558
You can't trust anyone around here.

17:03.131 --> 17:04.681
(Door opens)

17:04.766 --> 17:06.950
- Hey.
- Hey. You okay?

17:07.736 --> 17:10.136
Yeah. I just need to... get something.

17:12.473 --> 17:14.540
You hid a handgun in my bedroom?

17:14.576 --> 17:16.643
- Clearly.
- Stash one under my bed next time!

17:16.678 --> 17:20.946
I did. Ted just reprimanded me for
continuing to investigate the King's death.

17:21.016 --> 17:22.848
- You tell him about Lucius?
- Already knew.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.851
- Told me to let it go.
- Which you won't do.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.502
Not for a moment. I'll see ya.

17:26.588 --> 17:30.223
Jasper. Did you really hide
a loaded gun under my bed?

17:30.292 --> 17:32.158
- Yeah.
- What if someone comes in?

17:32.227 --> 17:34.694
- When was the last time?
- That's not the point.

17:34.763 --> 17:37.264
Seriously, when was the last
time you had someone in here?

17:37.332 --> 17:40.400
My birthday. I dunked Willow
in the Drunk Tank and then...

17:41.470 --> 17:43.436
There it is.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.656
Oh, shit.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.621
I'm so sorry.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.992
It happens.

18:09.831 --> 18:11.898
Your sister sets your palace on fire,

18:12.784 --> 18:15.986
you pursue a girl who knows
something about your shady past,

18:16.071 --> 18:19.739
forgetting the amazing girl in your
room for the next several days.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.341
It doesn't just happen.

18:24.713 --> 18:26.746
I...drank champagne.

18:27.332 --> 18:28.882
I had fun.

18:28.951 --> 18:31.101
And, when they evacuated the palace,

18:31.186 --> 18:33.036
I got an extra slice of cake.

18:34.556 --> 18:36.222
No drama.

18:37.109 --> 18:39.893
Come on, I want to show you something.

18:42.898 --> 18:45.615
Uh, by the way...

18:45.701 --> 18:49.235
don't think I missed the part
about you pursuing another girl.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.222
I thought you said no drama?

18:53.025 --> 18:55.075
A little drama.

18:55.744 --> 18:57.694
(Buzzes)

19:02.351 --> 19:04.751
Imogen, I was so worried.

19:04.786 --> 19:06.219
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:06.755 --> 19:09.522
Just slow down and
tell me where you are.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.526
Imogen?

19:14.062 --> 19:15.445
Imo...

19:19.034 --> 19:22.319
Sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.572
Oh, my God.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.839
Your Majesty.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.607
May I speak to you?

19:44.475 --> 19:46.074
First child?

19:47.712 --> 19:49.929
Children change everything.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.614
Yes.

19:51.683 --> 19:53.900
King Simon said that very thing.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.568
You were close to Simon.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.203
Until you had me dismissed.

19:57.288 --> 19:58.755
Yes.

19:58.823 --> 20:02.158
I believe your beloved fiance had
something to do with that, as well.

20:02.227 --> 20:03.793
Whatever you've come here to say...

20:03.862 --> 20:05.428
I'm sorry.

20:05.463 --> 20:07.063
I promise...

20:07.132 --> 20:10.700
I'm here out of concern
for you and your son.

20:12.103 --> 20:15.405
Cyrus is a dangerous man.

20:15.473 --> 20:18.241
I know everything I need
to know about the King.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.710
Fair enough.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.213
Then hear me as a mother.

20:24.299 --> 20:26.716
Royalty is irreversible.

20:26.801 --> 20:30.103
If you expose your son to
this life, to this world,

20:30.188 --> 20:31.754
there's no going back.

20:31.823 --> 20:33.806
Do you see this place?

20:33.892 --> 20:36.075
Do you think I enjoy living like this?

20:36.661 --> 20:38.728
That I want my son to live like this?

20:38.797 --> 20:42.298
Well, my son is going to enjoy
the same life that you have.

20:43.251 --> 20:45.835
And, once I marry the
King, I'll be Queen

20:45.904 --> 20:47.587
and you'll be irrelevant.

20:48.606 --> 20:50.306
I know you've struggled.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.176
Believe it or not, I did once, as well.

20:54.429 --> 20:57.330
But this decision you're
making is forever.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.616
And it's not just your forever.

21:00.685 --> 21:02.018
It's your son's, as well.

21:03.254 --> 21:05.121
The moment he's born,

21:05.190 --> 21:10.026
his life will be public and
destined and not his own.

21:11.095 --> 21:14.130
And Cyrus will be his
greatest influence.

21:14.165 --> 21:16.399
Consider that.

21:16.468 --> 21:18.367
I have.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.736
And I've made my decision.

21:20.805 --> 21:23.506
And now I would like you to go.

21:29.948 --> 21:32.081
I'm naming him Simon.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.284
You're the first to know.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.887
He wanted to disband the monarchy.

21:38.556 --> 21:40.590
Ask yourself why.

21:41.242 --> 21:43.259
My first-born son is gone.

21:44.145 --> 21:46.195
Protect yours.

21:53.238 --> 21:54.954
Here. Hold this to your eye.

21:55.039 --> 21:56.772
- (Winces)
- Gently. Gently.

21:56.841 --> 21:58.741
I'm gonna call my security detail.

21:58.810 --> 21:59.809
No.

21:59.894 --> 22:01.127
Please don't.

22:01.212 --> 22:03.880
Please. It will only make
things worse for me.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.350
This Dimitri guy, who was he?

22:08.403 --> 22:10.786
He's an acquaintance of Viktor's.

22:10.872 --> 22:13.222
So you were seeing him
and Viktor found out?

22:13.274 --> 22:14.524
No.

22:15.193 --> 22:17.059
Viktor loaned me to him.

22:21.699 --> 22:23.699
Okay, we're gonna get out of here.

22:23.768 --> 22:27.270
We're gonna go back to the palace
and we're gonna figure this out.

22:27.305 --> 22:28.638
I can't.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.306
I'm Viktor's property.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.708
- Eventually, he'll find me.
- No, no, no, no.

22:33.595 --> 22:35.661
You're nobody's property.

22:36.664 --> 22:38.281
Ever.

22:38.349 --> 22:42.001
I know this guy is powerful,
I know he's a bad guy,

22:42.086 --> 22:44.587
but the world is a big place.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.173
And the rest of your life
is a really long time.

22:48.626 --> 22:49.859
Exactly.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.596
The rest of my life will be a struggle
on my own. I can barely stay clean.

22:53.681 --> 22:55.965
I'll work some shit job.

22:56.034 --> 22:57.884
There's nothing out there for me.

22:59.904 --> 23:03.556
So you'd rather stay in this
screwed-up toxic environment,

23:03.641 --> 23:05.524
than face a life without what?

23:05.610 --> 23:08.544
- (Imogen sniffs)
- Fancy clothes and parties?

23:10.219 --> 23:11.627
Hey, hey.

23:11.695 --> 23:13.728
The girl I met in rehab...

23:15.047 --> 23:16.763
..she had fight.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.197
She had fire.

23:19.451 --> 23:23.236
And you can use that fire
and get away from all this.

23:25.575 --> 23:27.592
But to where?

23:28.761 --> 23:30.728
Anywhere but here.

23:36.102 --> 23:38.034
- (Knocking)
- Oh, it's Viktor.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.446
Imogen, open the door.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.284
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't
have called you.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.635
- Come on. Come on!
- Imogen, open the door!

24:19.446 --> 24:21.779
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.783
I am.

24:39.176 --> 24:41.243
You're both seriously missing out.

24:41.945 --> 24:45.947
- Okay. Who wants to start?
- Why are you following me?

24:46.016 --> 24:48.150
- Cos you're following him.
- Before today.

24:48.218 --> 24:49.584
- I wasn't. Were you?
- No.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.119
I was following him, though.

24:51.188 --> 24:52.454
What are you following me for?

24:52.523 --> 24:54.690
- I was following him, too.
- Why are you following me?

24:54.758 --> 24:56.925
Your accent sucks and you're
close to the Princess.

24:56.994 --> 24:59.194
- Your accent does suck.
- My accent does not suck.

24:59.263 --> 25:00.896
So everyone thinks I killed the King?

25:00.964 --> 25:03.231
No, no, son. I know you
didn't kill the King.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.300
- How's that?
- He's in love with the Princess.

25:05.369 --> 25:06.902
Can't blame you there.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.171
So you were following him.
Who was following you?

25:09.239 --> 25:10.939
Whoever killed the King, I suppose.

25:11.008 --> 25:12.441
The King's killer is in custody.

25:12.509 --> 25:14.876
35 years of service to
the crown, that man.

25:14.945 --> 25:16.545
A stellar performance record.

25:16.613 --> 25:18.880
Not even a suspect, but he
confesses months later.

25:18.949 --> 25:20.816
He's got "fall guy"
written all over him.

25:20.884 --> 25:22.651
He's right there. It wasn't Lucius.

25:23.354 --> 25:25.053
When Prince Robert was killed...

25:25.122 --> 25:26.338
By you.

25:26.423 --> 25:28.407
- There's no need for that.
- I think there is.

25:28.492 --> 25:30.359
- It's been established.
- Okay.

25:32.930 --> 25:35.197
When Robert was killed, by me,

25:35.265 --> 25:37.499
the calls came from inside the palace.

25:37.568 --> 25:39.468
Then King Simon is killed, not by me,

25:39.536 --> 25:41.403
somewhere in this area.

25:44.274 --> 25:47.542
I'm trying very hard not to
be the next dead man walking.

25:47.594 --> 25:50.846
So I figured I'd find the killer
before the killer found me.

25:51.915 --> 25:53.790
- I thought it might be him.
- It wasn't.

25:53.837 --> 25:55.470
Well, that's unfortunate.

25:55.556 --> 25:58.006
Are you sure the calls came
from inside the palace?

25:58.075 --> 25:59.925
(Text alert)

26:00.878 --> 26:02.852
Open the door. Open the door!

26:02.884 --> 26:05.367
- Viktor, please. I'm sorry.
- She's not sorry!

26:05.436 --> 26:08.504
And this is about to become
an international incident!

26:08.909 --> 26:09.868
We've gotta go.

26:10.975 --> 26:12.875
Oh, there was one more thing.

26:13.744 --> 26:15.461
Oh!

26:15.546 --> 26:17.012
That's for Prince Robert.

26:17.098 --> 26:19.415
Let's go. You're coming with me.
Come on!

26:28.126 --> 26:30.960
The Deputy Prime Minister
offered me a job today.

26:31.045 --> 26:32.995
It's in New York.

26:33.431 --> 26:35.431
Are you considering it?

26:35.516 --> 26:38.200
Possibly for all the wrong reasons.

26:38.236 --> 26:41.287
I'm interested to hear what you think.

26:41.372 --> 26:43.255
You know what I think.

26:43.341 --> 26:45.758
The monarchy puts you
in a unique position.

26:45.843 --> 26:48.577
Above the fray of politics
and self interest.

26:48.646 --> 26:52.181
We're ceremonial, for the most part.
It feels like we're irrelevant.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.883
Oh, yeah?

26:53.951 --> 26:56.185
Does that look irrelevant?

26:57.772 --> 27:00.322
You see any Members of
Parliament on there?

27:03.384 --> 27:06.051
Maybe you should remind
the Deputy Prime Minister

27:06.120 --> 27:08.087
that no-one comes to London to see her.

27:10.157 --> 27:12.124
- (Rattling)
- Open the door!

27:13.861 --> 27:16.996
- Imogen.
- Stay away from her!

27:18.199 --> 27:19.915
Argh!

27:20.001 --> 27:21.684
Let go of her! Viktor!

27:23.137 --> 27:25.604
- (Speaks Russian)
- Stay away from us!

27:25.673 --> 27:27.373
(Speaks Russian)

27:27.458 --> 27:30.376
There's always one jackass who
brings a knife to a gun fight.

27:30.444 --> 27:32.244
- You okay, Princess?
- Yeah.

27:32.913 --> 27:36.715
Say goodbye to the oil fields
in the North Sea, asshole!

27:42.640 --> 27:44.106
You did this to me.

27:45.793 --> 27:47.443
And I did it to myself.

27:47.528 --> 27:49.628
And now... I'm done doing it.

28:09.950 --> 28:11.463
Look after the Princess.

28:13.020 --> 28:15.921
Mr. Blokov and I are gonna
have a little chat.

28:36.110 --> 28:38.177
How did things go with Prudence?

28:38.245 --> 28:40.479
She seems determined to marry Cyrus.

28:41.482 --> 28:43.382
So maybe it's a sign.

28:44.352 --> 28:47.586
Have Alistair's blood tested.
Be with your true love.

28:47.672 --> 28:49.121
Find...

28:49.190 --> 28:51.757
life outside of these walls.

28:52.326 --> 28:55.077
I was listening to Liam's speech,

28:55.162 --> 28:57.096
watching him these last few days.

28:58.099 --> 29:00.666
He's so clearly Simon's son.

29:00.735 --> 29:02.768
- But you don't know that.
- I do.

29:02.837 --> 29:05.454
I know it in my heart.

29:05.539 --> 29:07.139
Let's say you're right.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.708
That doesn't mean you can't have love

29:09.777 --> 29:12.277
and life outside of these gates.

29:15.049 --> 29:17.099
This is my life.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.614
The Princess and Imogen are fine.

29:43.446 --> 29:45.906
- And the Russian?
- Oh, Mr. Blokov and I...

29:46.493 --> 29:48.560
reached an understanding.

29:48.645 --> 29:52.797
Plus, the Princess got his attention
with her North Sea oil comment.

29:53.867 --> 29:55.700
She's fierce, that girl.

29:55.769 --> 29:57.635
(American accent) You know...

30:00.407 --> 30:02.874
..I came here to steal
from them, because...

30:03.877 --> 30:05.844
..I thought they hadn't earned it...

30:06.746 --> 30:09.063
..and didn't deserve it.

30:10.083 --> 30:12.350
You had the chance to
take something valuable.

30:12.419 --> 30:15.286
You passed it up for
something priceless.

30:15.322 --> 30:17.722
You should return these
by hand this time.

who chose...

35:39.445 --> 35:42.647
to stay in a very broken,

35:42.715 --> 35:45.166
unhealthy place for so many reasons.

35:46.319 --> 35:48.653
She stayed because she felt...

35:48.721 --> 35:50.121
unworthy...

35:51.591 --> 35:53.558
..you know, unloved.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.399
