00:04.152 --> 00:05.759
where she came from, nothing,

00:05.794 --> 00:08.600
before she crawled out of
that bag in Times Square.

00:08.635 --> 00:09.813
- (Mayfair) Do you recognize her?
- No.

00:09.848 --> 00:12.275
Then why is your name
tattooed on her back?

00:12.310 --> 00:14.773
(Patterson) All of her tattoos
are brand-new.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.685
If that girl has information
about Daylight on her body

00:19.720 --> 00:22.355

very serious trouble.

I've been looking
for you my whole life.

If Jane Doe is Taylor Shaw,
then Dad is innocent.

Dad committed a murder

00:33.742 --> 00:35.360

that she's Taylor Shaw.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.354

contradict the isotope test.

- And then Dad comes out,

02:31.304 --> 02:34.872

are you in trouble?"

02:34.940 --> 02:37.465

out of the ditch,

05:09.803 --> 05:13.706
Why am I learning about this
from Patterson and not you?

05:13.773 --> 05:15.838
It doesn't
change a thing.

05:15.873 --> 05:18.093
This isotope test
on Jane's tooth

05:18.128 --> 05:21.236
stands in direct
conflict with the results

05:21.271 --> 05:23.324
matching her DNA
to Taylor Shaw.

05:23.359 --> 05:24.820
Which means
the isotope test is wrong.

05:24.855 --> 05:26.571
Which means one
of 'em is wrong.

05:26.606 --> 05:28.513
Look, I'm not talking
about some mineral

05:28.548 --> 05:30.222
that found a way
in her tooth somehow.

05:30.257 --> 05:32.127
I'm talking about her
genetic makeup.

05:32.162 --> 05:34.542
The building blocks of
her cellular identity.

05:34.609 --> 05:37.320
Chromium,
manganese,

05:37.355 --> 05:39.955
niobium, tantalum.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.918
These elements
at these ratios

05:41.953 --> 05:45.014
puts Jane's place of birth
and early childhood

05:45.049 --> 05:46.952
in Sub-Saharan Africa,

05:46.987 --> 05:48.586
which makes it
extremely difficult

05:48.621 --> 05:51.697
for her to have been born
and raised next door to you

05:51.732 --> 05:54.710
in Clearfield,
Pennsylvania.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.269
The DNA match was 99.9%.

05:57.304 --> 06:00.512
Now, the law treats
DNA as ironclad.

06:00.547 --> 06:02.368
So, why don't we?

06:02.403 --> 06:06.343
So, what, we just ignore
the isotopic evidence?

06:06.405 --> 06:09.299
Look, I know you want
Jane to be Taylor Shaw...

06:09.334 --> 06:12.072
Look, this has nothing to
do with what I want.

06:12.107 --> 06:15.497
Her DNA is Taylor's DNA.
End of story.

06:15.532 --> 06:17.951
Kurt, you can't pick
and choose evidence

06:17.986 --> 06:19.872
to suit your
preferred narrative.

06:19.907 --> 06:22.470
I shouldn't have
to tell you that.

06:23.473 --> 06:25.496
Have you told her yet?

06:25.531 --> 06:28.054

MWA?

Municipal Workers
Association.

06:50.549 --> 06:52.313
So, what, two gunmen
five minutes ago,

06:52.348 --> 06:53.815
NYPD called us already?

06:53.850 --> 06:55.233
No, they didn't.

06:55.268 --> 06:56.244
The building's
mailing address

06:56.279 --> 06:58.009
triggered a hit in our
tattoo database.

06:58.048 --> 07:00.409
A ten-digit number
on Jane's upper thigh.

07:00.444 --> 07:01.745
(Jane)
How is that an address?

07:01.780 --> 07:02.610
(Patterson)
It's not. In fact,

07:02.645 --> 07:04.865
there's, like, 37,000
possible permutations

07:04.900 --> 07:06.799

but one of them

09:51.634 --> 09:54.581
How could they have known that
this was going to happen?

09:54.639 --> 09:56.371
I don't know.

09:57.401 --> 10:00.222
Jane...

10:00.275 --> 10:03.464
Are you okay
to be here today?

10:03.499 --> 10:04.714
Last night you
seemed kind of...

10:04.749 --> 10:07.485
No, uh, the field
is the only place

10:07.520 --> 10:09.113
I feel comfortable.

10:09.148 --> 10:12.042
I know that feeling.
Trust me.

10:13.087 --> 10:14.821
I'm sorry about
last night.

10:14.889 --> 10:17.056
It was a lot
to take in.

10:17.124 --> 10:19.671
Probably too much.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.868
My sister, Sarah, she...

10:21.903 --> 10:24.789
Look, listen, Kurt, it...

10:24.824 --> 10:27.623
It wasn't Sarah.

10:27.892 --> 10:31.417
I see the way that
you look at me...

10:31.799 --> 10:35.092
and I don't know how to be
this person that you lost.

10:35.169 --> 10:37.174
(door opens)

10:37.263 --> 10:39.297
(Zapata)
I've got eyes inside.

10:42.148 --> 10:44.549
(faint police radio chatter)

10:46.321 --> 10:48.188
All right, I count
15 hostages up front

10:48.240 --> 10:50.908
plus however many
they took into the back.

10:51.296 --> 10:53.364
Look at how he's
covering the room.

10:55.296 --> 10:56.873
Optimizing angles
and sight lines.

10:56.908 --> 10:58.963
Is that part
of MWA training?

10:59.186 --> 11:01.253
The MWA has training?

11:03.401 --> 11:04.467
We got five minutes.

11:04.535 --> 11:06.102
(Reade)
How do you wanna play this?

11:10.774 --> 11:11.808
(gun slams on counter)

11:11.876 --> 11:14.044
(Velcro ripping)

11:14.111 --> 11:15.212
What are you doing?

11:15.279 --> 11:17.814
Buying us some time.

11:17.882 --> 11:21.917
(siren approaching)

11:21.985 --> 11:25.295
No one moves.
No one fires.

11:32.162 --> 11:33.628
(sighs)

11:34.608 --> 11:36.376
Sir?

11:40.570 --> 11:42.371
My name is Kurt Weller.

11:45.656 --> 11:48.343
I'm a special agent
with the FBI, okay?

11:48.410 --> 11:49.706
I'm the guy you've
been talking to.

11:49.741 --> 11:51.649
I'm unarmed.

11:51.693 --> 11:53.293
Look.

11:55.183 --> 11:56.984
- I'm here just to talk.
- (woman whimpering)

11:57.051 --> 11:58.577
Please, don't shoot me.

11:58.632 --> 11:59.920
I will kill her.

11:59.988 --> 12:03.254
The head of the WMA
is on his way here now.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.892
But he's coming
here from Jersey

12:04.959 --> 12:06.568
so we need a
little time.

12:06.603 --> 12:08.174
- Shut up!
- (sobbing)

12:08.221 --> 12:09.429
(Kurt)
Listen to me!

12:09.497 --> 12:13.454
The moment you hurt her
or anyone else in there,

12:13.489 --> 12:15.314
there's nothing more
I can do for you.

12:15.349 --> 12:17.660
You understand?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.877
I'm here as a show
of good faith.

12:20.732 --> 12:23.360
I'm putting
myself on the line

12:23.395 --> 12:25.011
to ask you for
an extension.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.078
(sobbing)

12:26.146 --> 12:30.156
Fine.
30 more minutes.

12:30.191 --> 12:31.501
Walk away.

12:35.078 --> 12:37.212
(crowd cheering
and applauding)

12:39.190 --> 12:42.258
That was too easy.
Way too easy.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.064
(woman whimpering)

12:47.132 --> 12:50.698
Hands over your head!
Over your head!

12:50.733 --> 12:54.070
Are you sure?
Thank you.

12:54.105 --> 12:55.733
Patterson just checked
our gunmen's faces

12:55.768 --> 12:58.051
against all MWA
employee photos,

12:58.086 --> 12:59.843
past and present.

12:59.911 --> 13:01.506
These guys never
worked here.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.864
(Weller) Why would they
lie about that?

13:02.923 --> 13:05.441
Look, they're bringing those
hostages out from the back.

13:07.889 --> 13:09.522
(Reade)
One of 'em is injured.

13:09.557 --> 13:10.876
Stop!

13:10.938 --> 13:13.380
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

13:13.490 --> 13:15.419
Thank you for giving
them more time.

13:15.454 --> 13:16.892
(hostages screaming)

13:16.961 --> 13:18.727
Move!
Take that building!

13:21.554 --> 13:24.356

Breach it!

Hey, you okay?

14:12.012 --> 14:13.237
What were
they doing here?

14:13.308 --> 14:15.576
Makes no sense
to me at all.

14:20.332 --> 14:21.699
What's wrong?

14:24.580 --> 14:27.226
You see that blood
on the door?

14:56.202 --> 14:58.303
(Weller)
Jane.

15:25.214 --> 15:26.948
I'm starting
to understand

15:27.015 --> 15:28.931
why this place is
tattooed on your body.

15:28.966 --> 15:30.700
What happened here?

15:30.735 --> 15:33.339
Shotgun, close range.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.919
Not much to identify.

15:38.859 --> 15:40.727
- Uhh! Ah!
- Jane!

Hey!

15:41.963 --> 15:44.364
(guns cocking)

15:44.567 --> 15:46.216
In the interest of
national security,

15:46.251 --> 15:48.569
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

15:48.604 --> 15:51.518
I'm gonna have to ask you
to identify yourself.

15:51.553 --> 15:54.537
Who are you?
What is this place?

15:54.572 --> 15:58.991
Tom Carter,
Deputy Director of the CIA.

15:59.116 --> 16:01.247
And this place...

16:01.502 --> 16:03.929
this place
doesn't exist.

16:11.478 --> 16:14.198
If we weren't
on U.S. soil,

16:14.233 --> 16:18.031
I'd say this place was
a CIA black site.

16:18.101 --> 16:19.037
(Jane)
What is that?

16:19.072 --> 16:21.454
The CIA have secret prisons
all over the world

16:21.489 --> 16:23.394
where they do things
they're not allowed to do

16:23.429 --> 16:24.735
inside the U.S.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.942
Detain people,
torture them.

16:27.009 --> 16:28.409
They're known
as black sites.

16:28.477 --> 16:31.029
Yeah, I'm not
familiar with the term.

16:31.064 --> 16:33.938
But if they were operating
one within the U.S.,

16:33.973 --> 16:35.713
that sort of thing would
bring down administrations.

16:35.748 --> 16:37.867
Well, good thing
there aren't any.

16:37.902 --> 16:39.230
Whoever this was,

16:39.265 --> 16:41.524
the gunman obviously
didn't want him to talk

16:41.559 --> 16:43.137
to the CIA at all.

16:43.172 --> 16:45.124
Upstairs was
a smoke screen.

16:45.159 --> 16:46.821
This was a hit.

16:46.868 --> 16:49.029
This is the
illustrated woman.

16:49.097 --> 16:51.765
I didn't realize they were
taking you out on field trips.

16:51.833 --> 16:53.037
(Mayfair) What the hell
are you doing here?

16:53.072 --> 16:55.569
This is
FBI jurisdiction.

16:55.637 --> 16:57.873
I thought we were
all on the same team.

16:57.908 --> 17:00.473
(laughing) Oh, now, that
is adorable.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.532
No, the FBI
are domestic.

17:02.578 --> 17:04.213
The CIA, international,

17:04.276 --> 17:06.933
which means they can't operate
within the United States.

17:06.988 --> 17:08.347
What is
this place?

17:08.415 --> 17:11.090
Well, I'm happy to fill
you in, Assistant Director,

17:11.126 --> 17:13.945
just... not in front
of a civilian.

17:13.981 --> 17:16.186
She shouldn't be here.

17:16.255 --> 17:18.857
(Weller)
Neither should you.

17:18.925 --> 17:21.126
Don't worry about it.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.529
I'll keep an eye on her.

17:26.965 --> 17:28.750
(police radio chatter)

17:28.813 --> 17:31.263
Hey... don't
sweat Carter.

17:31.302 --> 17:33.638
He's just a CIA suit
with field envy.

17:33.705 --> 17:35.869
That's not what's
bothering me.

17:35.904 --> 17:37.561
I want to review
that security footage.

17:37.596 --> 17:40.344
Yeah, sure, you just...

17:40.411 --> 17:44.314
don't need help with
that either, apparently.

17:46.852 --> 17:49.504
Repeat this or write it down
and I'll deny I ever said it,

17:49.539 --> 17:51.399
which won't be hard
since, tomorrow,

17:51.434 --> 17:53.504
this room won't be here.

17:53.539 --> 17:57.509
Unofficially, the guy
in the chair in there

17:57.544 --> 18:00.997
missing his face
is Dodi Khalil.

18:01.187 --> 18:02.721
(air hissing,
Dodi coughing)

18:02.756 --> 18:04.979
A mechanical engineer
in Pakistan

18:05.014 --> 18:07.108
that we leveraged into
an intelligence asset.

18:07.143 --> 18:09.153
This is how the CIA
treats its assets?

18:09.188 --> 18:11.439
He was feeding us
intel from a classified

18:11.507 --> 18:14.245
terrorist organization,
until they got wise.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.886
Extracting him
wasn't feasible.

18:15.921 --> 18:17.582
So, you cut him loose
and left him to die.

18:17.617 --> 18:19.581
Not how I'd put it,
but yeah.

18:19.616 --> 18:21.249
Unfortunately,
it happens.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.517
More unfortunately,
he escaped

18:23.585 --> 18:25.810
with a big old grudge
against the U.S. of A.

18:25.845 --> 18:27.855
So turning friends
into enemies.

18:27.923 --> 18:29.714
Seems to be
a CIA specialty.

18:29.749 --> 18:32.941
Dodi went underground.
We lost eyes on him.

18:32.976 --> 18:35.206
But it seems that he'd
been adapting his skills

18:35.241 --> 18:37.921
as an engineer to become
one hell of a bomb maker.

18:37.956 --> 18:39.692
He aligned himself
with a fringe group,

18:39.727 --> 18:41.497
- the Dabbur Zann.
- Dabbur Zann?

18:41.532 --> 18:43.605
It's from an old
Arabic proverb.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.716
"The buzzing of the wasp brings
destruction to its nest."

18:46.751 --> 18:49.028
I take it we're the wasp
in that scenario.

18:49.063 --> 18:50.740
(Mayfair) I've heard of
the Dabbur Zann.

18:50.775 --> 18:52.976
Multiethnic...
unusual for terrorists.

18:53.011 --> 18:54.663
Yeah, unusual
and dangerous.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.732
But they don't
operate in the U.S.

18:58.657 --> 19:01.926
I feel like you might
have old intel.

19:04.157 --> 19:06.358
(faint police radio chatter)

19:06.426 --> 19:08.594
Something's not right.

19:08.661 --> 19:10.662
(typing)

19:12.932 --> 19:15.365
Okay.

19:15.420 --> 19:19.370
Here, gunman one takes these
three hostages to the back room.

19:19.438 --> 19:24.075
Yeah... and then he
brings 'em back out, so...

19:25.811 --> 19:26.978
Wait a minute.

19:27.046 --> 19:28.213

Oh, my God.

19:32.683 --> 19:34.151
Oh, no.

19:34.219 --> 19:36.415
We caught up with Dodi
when he entered the country

19:36.450 --> 19:38.157
under a forged passport.

19:38.192 --> 19:40.770
What, you figured that he was
here to blow something up?

19:40.805 --> 19:43.026
Grabbed him,
black-sited him?

19:43.094 --> 19:44.361
This is the part
where I say

19:44.428 --> 19:47.107
I can neither
confirm nor deny.

19:47.166 --> 19:50.002
(cell phone vibrating)

19:50.234 --> 19:52.263
Well, this has
all been a smile,

19:52.298 --> 19:55.037
but, uh, I'm gonna
have to call it.

19:55.072 --> 19:56.937
You folks can
show yourselves out.

19:56.972 --> 19:59.842

three seconds.

20:19.695 --> 20:21.929
orders him to take the three
troublemaker hostages

20:21.997 --> 20:24.023
to the back.

20:24.058 --> 20:25.718
But what if the
troublemaker hostages

20:25.753 --> 20:28.034
weren't hostages at all?

To hide the part
that matters.

20:49.857 --> 20:50.594

Here, look.

20:50.629 --> 20:53.057
Look at this hostage
when he comes back out.

Sleeves are too long.
And look at that.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.731

He's wearing different shoes.

20:59.799 --> 21:01.831
It's a different guy.

21:03.142 --> 21:04.335
It's Dodi.

21:04.370 --> 21:06.405
This wasn't an execution.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.591
It's a rescue.

21:07.626 --> 21:08.485

This guy helps him take out

21:08.520 --> 21:10.779
the CIA with the other two
fake hostages,

21:10.814 --> 21:14.687
then gets taken out himself so
they can swap his body for Dodi.

21:14.722 --> 21:16.622
(Jane) They switch clothes and
give Dodi a head wound

21:16.657 --> 21:18.515
to hide his face.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.551
They start shooting hostages.

21:20.782 --> 21:23.351
Then they smuggle him out
with the rest of the injured.

21:26.825 --> 21:28.226
All right,
where's Dodi now?

21:37.768 --> 21:39.553

That's why Carter left.

21:39.592 --> 21:42.770
The CIA figured out that
Dodi was still in play.

21:43.015 --> 21:44.936
Carter said he was
a genius bomb maker, right?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.608
We gotta find Dodi,
work out exactly

21:46.676 --> 21:48.465
what the Dabbur Zann's
up to, and more importantly

21:48.500 --> 21:49.611
what kind of threat
they pose.

21:49.662 --> 21:51.211
CIA still has
a big lead on us.

21:51.258 --> 21:53.578
These two accomplices,
NYPD still got 'em?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.948
They should still be holding all
the hostages for questioning.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.215
Bring 'em here now.

21:57.824 --> 21:59.510
Dodi fell off
the CIA's radar

21:59.545 --> 22:00.818
years ago, right?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.091
And then,
when he reemerged,

22:02.158 --> 22:04.489
he was a completely
different person.

22:05.798 --> 22:07.912
I was only Taylor Shaw
for five years

22:07.947 --> 22:10.037
and then something
happened to me.

22:10.072 --> 22:13.751
A lot of things, maybe,
none of which we know.

22:13.786 --> 22:14.635
Yet.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.420
It feels like
you're waiting for me

22:17.455 --> 22:20.283
to remember something that
is never going to come.

22:20.721 --> 22:23.010
If your coming back has
taught me one thing,

22:23.593 --> 22:25.510
it's to never
give up hope.

22:30.788 --> 22:32.818
All right, let's be clear.

22:33.204 --> 22:35.930
We already know who you
are and what you did.

22:36.149 --> 22:37.789
We know the two of you
were accomplices

22:37.824 --> 22:39.173
in today's
hostage taking,

22:39.208 --> 22:42.765
the murder
of two CIA operatives,

22:42.800 --> 22:45.587
and the illegal extraction
of Dodi Khalil.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.514
The only question is...

22:48.549 --> 22:50.587
which one of you
is gonna help me?

22:50.786 --> 22:53.162
Which one of you
is going to rot away?

22:53.276 --> 22:55.534
Where is Dodi Khalil?

22:56.414 --> 22:58.220
(Zapata) Do I need to
worry about you?

22:58.255 --> 23:00.662
Nope, but you're
gonna do it anyway.

23:00.729 --> 23:02.330
You gotta watch yourself.

23:02.398 --> 23:03.898
Excuse me?

23:03.965 --> 23:06.506
It is one thing to express
concern about Jane internally.

23:06.541 --> 23:09.504
It's another thing to do
it outside of the group.

23:09.571 --> 23:11.570
Dude, you practically
took Carter's side

23:11.625 --> 23:14.675
when he was bad-mouthing
Jane back at the black site.

23:14.742 --> 23:16.677
It's not like
I said anything.

23:16.744 --> 23:18.679
What, I'm not allowed to
think my own thoughts now?

23:18.746 --> 23:20.011
You can think
your own thoughts

23:20.065 --> 23:23.883
but we have to remain
a united front.

23:23.951 --> 23:27.521
It's us against
Carter right now.

23:27.588 --> 23:28.390
Oh, you don't
think he's looking

23:28.425 --> 23:30.129
for a point
of weakness?

23:30.239 --> 23:31.820
Why don't you
worry about you?

23:31.855 --> 23:32.980
(pounding table)

23:33.015 --> 23:35.138
(Weller) You saw what
the CIA did to Dodi.

23:35.173 --> 23:38.156
This is your last chance
to help yourself.

23:38.686 --> 23:40.932
You wanna breathe
fresh air again?

23:40.967 --> 23:43.170
Do you want
to see the sun?!

23:43.205 --> 23:45.137
It's too late for me.

23:45.172 --> 23:47.104
Answer me!

23:47.172 --> 23:48.140
(sobbing)

23:48.186 --> 23:49.654
Answer me!

23:56.615 --> 23:58.783
What... the hell?

24:04.021 --> 24:06.423
You'll never find it.

24:07.892 --> 24:09.989
(Patterson) We just got their
blood work back.

24:10.024 --> 24:12.441
They're both dying of acute
radiation poisoning.

24:12.488 --> 24:14.479
This whole group
has been exposed

24:14.514 --> 24:18.301
to an extremely unstable
isotope called cesium-137.

24:18.340 --> 24:19.502
Smugglers have
been moving

24:19.570 --> 24:21.437
cesium out of Abkhazia,

24:21.505 --> 24:23.847
selling it to terrorists
on the black market.

24:23.882 --> 24:25.775
Apparently in leaky
containers.

24:25.893 --> 24:28.086
So that's why
they're so fearless.

24:28.121 --> 24:29.984
They're already dying.

24:30.019 --> 24:31.974
What do you do
with cesium-137?

24:32.009 --> 24:34.644
Make a radiological
dispersal device.

24:34.679 --> 24:36.331
The Dabbur Zann
sacrificed five of its own

24:36.366 --> 24:40.004
to release one of the world's
best bomb makers.

24:40.072 --> 24:43.708
Dodi's making 'em
a dirty bomb.

24:51.004 --> 24:52.816
With Dodi's
bomb-making abilities

24:52.851 --> 24:56.671
and the nuclear materials
provided by the Dabbur Zann,

24:56.706 --> 24:59.522
we have to assume that he's
capable of constructing

24:59.557 --> 25:02.151
a dirty bomb that could
do substantial damage.

25:02.219 --> 25:04.486
Dabbur Zann broke him out of
that black site for a reason.

25:04.554 --> 25:05.772
He still has to build it.

25:05.807 --> 25:07.331
So, let's find him
before he does.

25:07.366 --> 25:08.488
Right, but how
do we do that?

25:08.523 --> 25:11.804
The cesium-137 our radioactive
friends have been exposed to

25:11.839 --> 25:13.507
emits trackable gamma rays.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.264
A hospital in Queens

25:15.299 --> 25:17.292
has reported several
unrelated patients

25:17.327 --> 25:18.858
coming to the ER
this past week

25:18.893 --> 25:20.682
with similar
flu-like symptoms.

25:20.717 --> 25:23.732
Two of them have started
losing their hair.

25:23.767 --> 25:27.780
All of the patients live
or work in this 30-block radius.

25:27.815 --> 25:30.175
This has to be where the
Dabbur Zann have set up shop.

25:30.210 --> 25:32.640
30 blocks, that's a lot
of doors to knock on.

25:32.675 --> 25:35.054
Which is why I've got
every vehicle I can spare

25:35.089 --> 25:36.817
tasked with
combing the area.

25:36.885 --> 25:38.977
Weller, you quarterback
from here.

25:39.012 --> 25:42.170
Patterson's outfitted
each team with one of these.

25:42.205 --> 25:44.099
Portable Geiger counters.

25:44.134 --> 25:46.022
This should lead us
right to them.

25:46.285 --> 25:48.242
These potassium iodide pills

25:48.277 --> 25:50.482
should prevent you from
getting radiation poisoning

25:50.517 --> 25:53.945
until we can recover
and contain the cesium.

25:53.980 --> 25:56.013
- Bottoms up.
- One more thing.

25:56.048 --> 25:58.545
The higher the CPMs, the less
time you should stick around.

25:58.580 --> 26:01.009
Once they hit 300,
get the hell out.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.684
After that,
all the potassium iodide

26:02.719 --> 26:05.655
in the world is not
gonna help you for long.

26:08.114 --> 26:11.016
(siren whooping)

26:14.941 --> 26:16.521
(computer chirping)

26:16.963 --> 26:18.163
Think they'll find it?

26:18.241 --> 26:21.025
You don't remember playing
"Hot or Cold," do you?

26:21.217 --> 26:21.952
No.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.323
As long as those Geiger
readings are going up,

26:24.444 --> 26:26.051
it means we're
getting hotter.

26:27.009 --> 26:29.310
What happened
after I disappeared?

26:30.566 --> 26:32.159
The community imploded.

26:32.238 --> 26:36.173
No, I... I mean,
what happened with you?

26:38.642 --> 26:42.449
We had a secret
hiding spot in the woods

26:42.574 --> 26:45.881
in back of our houses.

26:45.956 --> 26:48.558
It was your
favorite place.

26:49.162 --> 26:53.274
I figured... if you
ever got away,

26:53.703 --> 26:54.995
that's where you'd go.

26:55.151 --> 26:57.393
I never gave up
on you.

26:57.590 --> 27:01.776
I know being Taylor
might not be an answer

27:01.925 --> 27:04.300
to all of your problems.

27:04.671 --> 27:06.735
But it's
a starting point.

27:07.197 --> 27:11.339
Something to hold onto,
something to build from.

27:12.641 --> 27:14.843
(computer beeping)

27:14.945 --> 27:16.077
Here we go.

27:16.269 --> 27:18.103
Team, on me.

27:19.415 --> 27:21.700
This is Agent Weller,
what have you got?

27:21.735 --> 27:23.717
<i>This is Agent Knox, we got an
old industrial building here.</i>

27:23.752 --> 27:25.145
<i>Looks vacant.
My team's standing by</i>

27:25.180 --> 27:26.498
<i>to breach the doors
on your say-so.</i>

27:26.533 --> 27:27.209
Take it.

27:27.244 --> 27:29.082
- (banging)
- <i>Clear!</i>

27:29.117 --> 27:30.893
<i>Pretty dark in here.
Lights don't work.</i>

27:30.928 --> 27:33.780
<i>I got a staircase to
the basement, heading down now.</i>

27:38.097 --> 27:40.632
<i>Pretty cold down here.
Geigers are clicking up.</i>

27:41.050 --> 27:43.026
<i>We got a door, can't hear
anything behind it.</i>

27:43.126 --> 27:45.293
<i>- Taking the door now.
- (banging)</i>

27:48.481 --> 27:49.342
<i>- (gunshots)
- Come on.</i>

27:49.409 --> 27:51.110
<i>Watch out!</i>

27:51.257 --> 27:53.635
Knox?
Agent Knox, report.

27:53.670 --> 27:54.628
<i>All clear.
Exchanged fire</i>

27:54.675 --> 27:56.668
<i>with two individuals,
now both deceased.</i>

27:56.715 --> 27:58.250
<i>Looks like neither
of them were doing too good,</i>

27:58.318 --> 27:59.352
<i>even before we got here.</i>

27:59.419 --> 28:00.831
What else do you see there?

28:00.870 --> 28:03.393
<i>Beds.
They got beds down here.</i>

28:03.428 --> 28:05.362
<i>Who the hell could sleep
in this place?</i>

28:25.546 --> 28:27.844
Find out where
those guys went.

28:27.879 --> 28:30.481
(hyperventilating)

28:41.325 --> 28:43.259
Jane.

28:43.327 --> 28:45.261
Jane,
you all right?

28:47.064 --> 28:49.465
I saw who took me.

28:50.667 --> 28:51.991
When I was little,

28:52.026 --> 28:54.392
there was this...
this stairwell

28:54.436 --> 28:56.670
and this room,
and then there was...

28:56.872 --> 28:59.474
all these children.

28:59.542 --> 29:00.775
What was he doing?

29:00.843 --> 29:03.889
Did you see him?
Did you see his face, Jane?

29:04.053 --> 29:07.882
No, I just... I just
saw his hands.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.984
And he was... God...

29:11.053 --> 29:12.786
Oh, no.

29:12.854 --> 29:14.388
What happened to me?

29:14.456 --> 29:16.057
- Hey, Jane.
- Huh?

29:16.124 --> 29:17.624
Jane, Jane.

29:17.692 --> 29:20.227
- (fighting tears)
- Here.

29:20.295 --> 29:22.729
Do you feel that?

29:22.797 --> 29:23.897
(crying)

29:23.965 --> 29:25.165
I'm here.

29:25.232 --> 29:26.999
I'm right here
with you.

29:27.068 --> 29:29.102
You're okay.

29:29.170 --> 29:31.571
Keep breathing, Jane.

29:31.755 --> 29:34.491
You're okay,
just keep breathing.

29:37.725 --> 29:39.416
Is everything
okay out here?

29:40.814 --> 29:42.581
Yeah.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.387
We're good.

29:48.455 --> 29:50.655
You sure?
She seemed a little...

29:50.723 --> 29:54.021
She's fine.
What do you got?

29:54.056 --> 29:55.529
Knox found a list
of names.

29:55.564 --> 29:57.996
Dabbur Zann?
Targets?

29:58.064 --> 29:59.297
Neither, we just ran them.

29:59.332 --> 30:01.449
All deceased, all buried
in the nearest cemetery

30:01.484 --> 30:02.766
to the radiation zone.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.464
Cesium.

30:04.499 --> 30:06.568
Where do you hide something
that makes everybody sick?

30:06.603 --> 30:08.937
A place where
everyone's already dead.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.979
(Weller)
<i>All right, cesium's close.</i>

30:32.370 --> 30:35.131
<i>Let's take a look around,
see if we can find it.</i>

30:39.747 --> 30:41.370
(device beeping)

30:41.711 --> 30:43.745
How is it
getting closer?

30:46.924 --> 30:48.491
Hang on.

30:53.583 --> 30:54.830
Cover, cover!

30:54.865 --> 30:57.730
(gunfire)

30:57.776 --> 30:58.876
Cover!

31:02.891 --> 31:03.824
Agh!

31:04.881 --> 31:05.814
Go up!

31:07.828 --> 31:08.762
Come on.

31:08.829 --> 31:10.197
Go up! Go up!

31:10.265 --> 31:12.065
(Weller)
Keep going! Move up!

31:12.133 --> 31:14.901
(gunfire continues)

31:23.923 --> 31:26.449
Dodi's got that cesium
inside that urn he's holding.

31:28.815 --> 31:30.149
Cover me!

31:30.662 --> 31:32.362
(gunfire continues)

31:47.563 --> 31:50.140
- Any ideas?
- They got the cesium.

31:50.606 --> 31:52.205
But they still gotta get
out of here with it.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.153
You make it sound like
we have the advantage.

31:54.188 --> 31:55.521
(Patterson) <i>Hey, Weller, you guys
gotta get out of there.</i>

31:55.556 --> 31:56.792
Your Geiger readings
are way...

31:56.827 --> 31:58.083
Thank you, Patterson!

31:58.118 --> 31:59.899
I think we're
a little outgunned.

31:59.934 --> 32:01.984
- We gotta keep moving.
- All right.

32:02.129 --> 32:03.829
- You ready?
- Let's go.

32:07.353 --> 32:10.039
Okay, guys, just remember
that the cesium in the urn

32:10.074 --> 32:12.451
<i>is highly unstable, but you
should be able to handle it</i>

32:12.486 --> 32:13.839
<i>for just a brief
period of time.</i>

32:13.874 --> 32:15.881
But if it breaks open...

32:15.949 --> 32:16.900
Spit it out, Patterson!

32:16.935 --> 32:19.151
Then that's it.

32:19.218 --> 32:21.886
It's game over for
everyone in the cemetery.

32:21.954 --> 32:24.422
(gunfire continues)

32:26.699 --> 32:28.019
Keeping that in mind.

32:28.054 --> 32:30.455
All right, hear that, team?
Don't shoot Dodi.

32:31.948 --> 32:34.048
(Jane) I see Dodi.
I'm heading for him now.

32:34.116 --> 32:35.783
(Reade)
I got a line on him.

32:38.687 --> 32:39.988
- (gunshots)
- Ah! Gah.

32:40.055 --> 32:42.056
Scratch it,
I'm pinned down!

32:42.124 --> 32:43.057
(machine gun fire)

32:44.471 --> 32:45.342
Uhh!

32:45.377 --> 32:47.679
Come on! Let's go!

32:50.474 --> 32:52.574
(grunting)

32:57.823 --> 32:58.990
Uhh!

33:05.173 --> 33:06.607
Ohh! Uhh!

33:09.093 --> 33:10.561
Uhh!

33:14.855 --> 33:16.689
I'm going after Dodi.

33:17.630 --> 33:19.531
I'm on my way!

33:37.347 --> 33:39.675
- (gun cocking)
- I did not want this.

33:39.710 --> 33:40.740
Any of this.

33:40.775 --> 33:42.612
Uhh!

33:42.839 --> 33:44.648
You're a popular guy,
Dodi.

33:44.716 --> 33:46.299
Talk to you about
your new friends.

33:46.334 --> 33:48.418
Get up!
Get up!

33:48.486 --> 33:49.692
Walk.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.916
Jane, you want
to put that down?

33:53.424 --> 33:54.800
Put that down.
All right.

33:54.835 --> 33:56.441
Let's get some distance
from that thing

33:56.476 --> 33:58.726
till Hazmat gets here.

33:58.772 --> 34:00.105
Walk!

34:15.156 --> 34:15.678
(gun cocking)

34:15.748 --> 34:17.650
Don't you dare.

34:21.152 --> 34:23.954
You have your shot.
Take it.

34:24.100 --> 34:27.034
I'm not you.
Drop it.

34:30.964 --> 34:33.531
You think
you're saving her.

34:33.661 --> 34:36.321
All you're doing
is killing us.

34:36.402 --> 34:38.071
(uncocks gun)

34:45.801 --> 34:47.376
Nice work.

34:47.445 --> 34:49.002
Could've used
your help out there.

34:49.078 --> 34:52.867
Oh, come on, you guys know that
we can't operate domestically.

34:52.928 --> 34:55.396
It's Reade, right?

34:55.820 --> 34:57.876
You ever think about
working for the good guys,

34:58.009 --> 35:00.279
we should talk.

35:00.336 --> 35:01.837
What's going on?

35:03.182 --> 35:05.084
Nothing.

35:07.854 --> 35:11.035
Well, hey there.
What's your name?

35:11.350 --> 35:12.833
How 'bout you
walk away now?

35:12.971 --> 35:14.939
How 'bout that?

35:23.412 --> 35:24.344
No.

35:24.715 --> 35:25.560
Get your hands off him.

35:25.595 --> 35:27.026
We'll take it
from here.

35:27.093 --> 35:27.728
Hell you will.

35:27.763 --> 35:29.789
I suggest you
stand down, son.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.560
This was a threat
on U.S. soil.

35:31.681 --> 35:34.146
Dodi's FBI jurisdiction,
and you know it.

35:34.181 --> 35:36.883
Since when do you
play by the rules?

35:37.787 --> 35:39.087
(gun cocks)

35:39.191 --> 35:40.425
Hey!

36:00.958 --> 36:03.708
Deputy Director Carter,
stand down.

36:03.743 --> 36:05.812
Mm, you stand down.

36:05.882 --> 36:06.942
(chuckling)
By my count, you folks

36:06.981 --> 36:08.356
come up a little short.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.433
Dodi's coming with us.

36:10.519 --> 36:12.935
We go back a long way,
and I know what you stand for

36:13.007 --> 36:14.742
and I know what
you're capable of.

36:14.807 --> 36:15.941
But are you really
prepared to kill

36:15.976 --> 36:18.299
five FBI agents
in cold blood?

36:18.334 --> 36:19.871
Well, don't you
mean four?

36:21.407 --> 36:24.084
And I can't give you
someone who doesn't exist.

36:24.146 --> 36:26.084
Is this about
Dodi or me?

36:26.120 --> 36:29.922
Well, why...
a bit of both, probably.

36:30.393 --> 36:32.188
Look, your people
can take full credit

36:32.270 --> 36:33.754
for the recovery
of the cesium.

36:33.789 --> 36:35.552
That's a big internal
win for the Bureau,

36:35.620 --> 36:37.185
and don't tell me
you don't need it.

36:37.254 --> 36:39.006
The CIA can have Dodi,

36:39.061 --> 36:40.998
I just wanna question him,
find out how far

36:41.033 --> 36:43.134
the Dabbur Zann's
reach is here.

36:44.088 --> 36:46.428
One day is
all I'm asking.

36:47.931 --> 36:49.165
Fine.

36:49.466 --> 36:51.934
You lend me Jane,
I'll lend you Dodi.

36:52.659 --> 36:54.149
See, one of those
tattoos on your girl

36:54.184 --> 36:55.700
has led to a damn
CIA black site.

36:55.754 --> 36:57.444
You think I don't have
questions of my own?

36:57.479 --> 36:59.705
We stumbled across
your little secret

36:59.772 --> 37:01.195
after the hostage takedown.

37:01.254 --> 37:02.662
She had nothing
to do with it.

37:02.697 --> 37:03.864
(scoffs)
Oh, come on.

37:04.031 --> 37:06.380
Why else bring her here?
Team spirit?

37:06.505 --> 37:09.212
It was Jane,
and I want her.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.320
Go to hell.

37:11.388 --> 37:14.951
You sure you want to start
a war with me today?

37:23.455 --> 37:26.590
No...
Not today.

37:28.243 --> 37:29.570
Give them Dodi.

37:29.605 --> 37:30.530
You expect me
to listen to that?

37:30.565 --> 37:32.632
Just do it!

37:35.338 --> 37:37.777
I won't forget this.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.847
Well, I actually hope
you keep it in mind.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.621
What'll the CIA
do with him?

37:50.058 --> 37:51.891
Whatever they want.

38:03.636 --> 38:05.456
(Mayfair)
You all did good work today.

38:05.597 --> 38:08.117
We averted a major
nuclear catastrophe

38:08.180 --> 38:10.695
and it looks like
the Dabbur Zann's foothold here

38:10.730 --> 38:11.944
has been dismantled.

38:12.011 --> 38:13.258
The city of New York

38:13.293 --> 38:16.057
owes you a deep
debt of gratitude,

38:16.120 --> 38:19.016
even if they'll
never know it.

38:19.085 --> 38:20.584
I'm proud of all of you.

38:20.619 --> 38:21.620
What about Carter?

38:21.655 --> 38:23.491
Let me worry about Carter.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.205
(Weller)
Jane's tattoos.

38:25.572 --> 38:26.985
It's getting hard to
ignore that they seem

38:27.020 --> 38:29.181
to be pointing us towards
government corruption.

38:29.216 --> 38:30.393
I understand your concern,

38:30.428 --> 38:32.565
but she has hundreds
of tattoos.

38:32.667 --> 38:35.282
It's too early to start
jumping to conclusions.

38:35.341 --> 38:36.951
(Patterson)
All I know is these clues

38:36.986 --> 38:39.679
are helping us
catch the bad guys.

38:39.828 --> 38:41.943
So, if they keep
doing that,

38:42.269 --> 38:44.408
we should keep
following them.

38:45.257 --> 38:46.223
Right?

38:46.312 --> 38:47.610
That's right.

38:49.727 --> 38:52.028
Now, go home
and get some sleep.

38:52.829 --> 38:54.096
(grunts)

38:55.536 --> 38:59.442
I, uh... I just
wanna say thank you

38:59.815 --> 39:02.583
for not trading me
to Carter today.

39:04.316 --> 39:07.117
For a second, I thought that
you were maybe considering it.

39:09.041 --> 39:10.730
Rest up.

39:10.826 --> 39:13.260
Tomorrow's another day.

39:25.554 --> 39:27.455
This really
wasn't necessary.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.438
It's more for me
than you.

39:29.488 --> 39:31.155
I just wanna check
out the new place,

39:31.638 --> 39:34.205
make sure it's okay.

39:34.389 --> 39:36.123
Make sure
you're okay.

39:36.311 --> 39:39.225
I'm fine, I... I...
I was just a little...

39:39.495 --> 39:41.429
(clears throat)
I'll be fine.

39:43.578 --> 39:45.713
I'm sorry
I lost it today.

39:45.993 --> 39:48.528
It's okay.
It happens.

39:57.606 --> 40:00.007
You've been
through so much.

40:00.548 --> 40:02.199
And if I'm making this
harder for you,

40:02.234 --> 40:04.214
then just tell me,

40:04.262 --> 40:07.230
'cause that's the last
thing that I want.

40:07.632 --> 40:09.966
All these expectations...

40:10.083 --> 40:12.617
I should never have
put you in that situation.

40:12.824 --> 40:14.892
Kurt...

40:15.410 --> 40:18.896
I should never have
let them take you.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.627
(whispering)
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:22.147 --> 40:24.281
It wasn't your fault.

40:26.201 --> 40:29.435
I've heard that...

40:29.707 --> 40:31.040
my whole life.

40:31.911 --> 40:34.611
But you haven't
heard it from me.

40:36.878 --> 40:39.183
It wasn't your fault.

40:42.175 --> 40:45.353
You told me Taylor
was my starting point.

40:45.450 --> 40:47.186
I think you're wrong.

40:51.561 --> 40:54.896
You...

40:55.130 --> 40:58.667
you're my starting point.

41:06.475 --> 41:08.576
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:10.646 --> 41:13.249
Okay.

41:13.331 --> 41:16.966
(door opens and closes)

41:23.383 --> 41:25.651
Hey.

41:25.909 --> 41:27.539
Don't be mad, okay?

41:27.984 --> 41:29.016
Mad about what?

41:29.051 --> 41:31.373
I just... I wa... I want you
to give this a chance.

41:31.408 --> 41:32.154
What are you talking about?

41:32.189 --> 41:33.841
Uncle Kurt, Uncle Kurt!

41:33.876 --> 41:34.865
- Hey, little buddy.
- Look!

41:34.900 --> 41:36.464
It's Grandpa!

41:42.079 --> 41:44.013
Hello, son.

41:49.467 --> 41:51.901
Kurt, don't go.

41:58.468 --> 41:59.868
(passenger door opens)

42:02.037 --> 42:03.104
(door shuts)

42:05.082 --> 42:07.216
I knew you'd
come around.

42:15.784 --> 42:18.052
Let's talk about
Jane Doe.
