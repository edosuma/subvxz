00:28.610 --> 00:30.245
Where's Reverend Lovejoy?

00:30.294 --> 00:32.683
He's never been late for christmas service.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.294
Maybe he's cheating on us 
with the episcopalians.

00:35.628 --> 00:40.066
Look at 'em, with their bright, airy 
narthex and light, flaky eucharist.

00:40.275 --> 00:43.226
I wouldn't mind dipping 
my hand in their font.

00:47.161 --> 00:48.704
Christ is born; who's on my horn?

00:48.815 --> 00:50.062
Bad news, Ned.

00:50.124 --> 00:51.906
There's been a horrible train wreck.

00:53.983 --> 00:57.476
So many little plastic christmases ruined.

00:58.067 --> 01:00.219
You want me to deliver the christmas sermon?

01:00.250 --> 01:03.022
I feel like I'm born again again!

01:07.780 --> 01:08.953
Now, don't be nervous, Ned.

01:09.053 --> 01:11.257
You've practiced this so 
many times in the shower.

01:12.387 --> 01:13.470
Paper cut!

01:17.787 --> 01:20.209
Now there's no one to deliver the sermon.

01:20.295 --> 01:22.151
Did anyone order a hero?

01:29.460 --> 01:31.787
Okay, christmas... christmas...

01:32.113 --> 01:34.117
you know how your paper boy always sends you

01:34.191 --> 01:36.256
a christmas card with his home address on it?

01:36.453 --> 01:37.523
What's up with that?

01:37.633 --> 01:39.491
I wanted you to tip me!

01:39.577 --> 01:42.036
No tip till they bring back hagar the horrible.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.737
That's not my decision.

01:43.934 --> 01:46.306
It's never anybody's decision.

01:47.753 --> 01:48.441
Anyhoo...

01:48.712 --> 01:53.347
I'd like to tell you all a little 
story I call "the first christmas."

01:55.194 --> 01:58.108
I, for one, am dying to hear it.

01:58.195 --> 02:03.690
A carpenter named Joseph was about 
to get some frankly preposterous news.

02:04.344 --> 02:07.567
Joseph, you know I have never lain with a man.

02:07.678 --> 02:09.018
Tell me about it.

02:09.190 --> 02:11.464
And yet, I am with child.

02:12.026 --> 02:14.135
A pregnant virgin?!

02:14.220 --> 02:16.480
That's every man's worst nightmare.

02:18.191 --> 02:20.163
Hail Mary, full of grace.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.922
That's not all she's full of.

02:21.959 --> 02:24.651
Quiet, you. Mary, you carry in your womb

02:24.700 --> 02:28.625
the son of god, who will grow 
up to become king of the jews.

02:28.675 --> 02:30.457
So, not a doctor...

02:30.470 --> 02:32.637
well, he will be able to heal the sick.

02:32.759 --> 02:34.617
But nothing to hang on the wall.

02:39.369 --> 02:43.826
King Herod, we three wise men come 
bearing gifts for the king of the jews.

02:44.090 --> 02:45.332
We bring gold....

02:45.663 --> 02:46.634
Frankincense...

02:46.788 --> 02:50.699
and myrrh, which I am re-gifting, 
'cause who needs myrrh?

02:50.763 --> 02:52.275
Here's the tag.

02:52.388 --> 02:53.163
Thank you.

02:53.355 --> 02:55.081
Which one should I open first?

02:56.645 --> 02:58.563
This is awkward.

02:59.754 --> 03:03.939
The king of the jews we seek is, a newborn child.

03:04.144 --> 03:08.605
Find this pretender to my 
throne and bring him to me.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.113
Now you wouldn't hurt the little boychik.

03:11.338 --> 03:12.605
Of course not.

03:12.922 --> 03:14.754
Kings don't hurt babies.

03:14.934 --> 03:17.149
Giant pointy swords hurt babies.

03:19.216 --> 03:20.359
Good king Herod!

03:20.396 --> 03:22.941
Except you don't really have the "good," so...

03:23.052 --> 03:24.675
what do you have, really, then?

03:28.599 --> 03:29.676
Now, don't you worry.

03:29.725 --> 03:31.440
I got plenty of rooms at my inn.

03:31.501 --> 03:33.100
All with brand-new carpeting.

03:33.192 --> 03:35.113
I think my water just broke!

03:35.153 --> 03:36.161
You can have the barn.

03:36.403 --> 03:39.100
Now feel free to come by the 
main house for breakfast.

03:39.398 --> 03:40.443
There won't be any.

03:47.184 --> 03:48.823
Just keep pushing, sweetie.

03:48.884 --> 03:50.544
The doctor will be here any second.

03:50.581 --> 03:52.397
Shalom, everybody.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.699
I've got some very good news.

03:56.733 --> 04:00.534
Caesar just invented the cesarean.

04:01.726 --> 04:03.506
Get him out of here!

04:09.329 --> 04:12.679
I knew I'd like him, but I never 
dreamed I'd adore him.

04:12.783 --> 04:14.566
I've got the messiah's nose.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.303
I've got the messiah's nose.

04:16.358 --> 04:16.961
Give it back.

04:16.998 --> 04:17.478
Give it back.

04:17.545 --> 04:18.572
He'll kill us all!

04:19.026 --> 04:21.165
He looks just like his dad.

04:22.421 --> 04:23.359
Not you!

04:23.458 --> 04:26.839
I'm not the father, I'm not a 
wise man, I'm nothing.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.487
This is the worst christmas ever.

04:31.430 --> 04:34.343
Maybe a little toot off the old 
wine skin'll cheer me up.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.426
My wine turned into water!

04:42.589 --> 04:44.781
Who could have performed such a cruel miracle?

04:45.879 --> 04:46.995
why, you little...!

04:48.183 --> 04:49.310
Joseph, no!

04:49.510 --> 04:51.430
He has to stay alive till he's 33,

04:51.472 --> 04:53.976
when he'll be renounced by 
his friends and crucified.

04:54.924 --> 04:55.613
Sorry, kid.

05:00.215 --> 05:03.906
Anytime anyone suffers in the 
world, he starts crying again.

05:04.047 --> 05:05.278
Can you do something?

05:05.444 --> 05:08.543
Me? But I'm watching the orange bowl.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.052
Now!

05:24.748 --> 05:26.657
You like physical comedy?

05:26.839 --> 05:27.961
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk...

05:28.224 --> 05:30.666
A... wise man?

05:30.845 --> 05:31.492
Pick two!

05:36.362 --> 05:37.594
why, I oughta...

05:39.747 --> 05:40.696
now, hold still.

05:52.205 --> 05:55.961
I think this nontraditional 
household just might make it.

05:57.908 --> 06:01.205
Jesus, Mary and Joseph we got a great family.

06:01.304 --> 06:02.849
Now, let's get some sleep.

06:03.105 --> 06:04.796
Herod is coming for the child.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.155
Manger danger!

06:06.203 --> 06:07.340
Manger danger!

06:09.520 --> 06:11.012
The kid you're looking for is in there.

06:11.146 --> 06:14.078
The other tenants have been complaining 
about the incessant swaddling

06:14.189 --> 06:15.618
all hours, day and night.

06:16.089 --> 06:19.110
Gee, chief, I feel pretty bad, 
trying to take out a baby.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.355
Don't worry, boys.

06:20.536 --> 06:23.239
No one will ever speak or write of this again.

06:24.846 --> 06:26.651
What a boffo beginning for my book!

06:31.869 --> 06:32.453
There they are.

06:32.486 --> 06:33.665
I see his head dealy.

06:33.944 --> 06:35.142
Follow that glow!

06:39.271 --> 06:40.711
They put his halo on a duck.

06:41.124 --> 06:42.595
The oldest trick in the book.

06:44.042 --> 06:44.970
What the hell are you doing?

06:45.078 --> 06:46.403
Well, he does have a halo.

06:46.691 --> 06:48.131
Hail, quackie!

06:54.764 --> 06:56.893
That ought to spruce things up.

07:09.494 --> 07:11.914
What a beautiful hanukkah bush!

07:12.064 --> 07:14.694
I say we call it a "christmas tree."

07:15.758 --> 07:16.979
A christmas tree...

07:17.034 --> 07:18.464
what a great name.

07:18.577 --> 07:20.914
Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.

07:23.961 --> 07:25.091
And did you know...

07:25.583 --> 07:30.675
That little baby Jesus grew up to be... Jesus?

07:32.796 --> 07:33.704
I know.

07:33.793 --> 07:35.056
It's weird, isn't it?

07:40.285 --> 07:43.207
The energizer bunny christmas special.

07:44.777 --> 07:47.239
I don't know why I'm so run down.

07:47.350 --> 07:49.667
I must be low on christmas spirit.

07:49.833 --> 07:51.871
It's 'cause you're using regular batteries.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.109
You forgot about energizer ultra!

07:54.128 --> 07:56.080
Now let me crawl inside you.

07:57.224 --> 07:59.134
Cold... so cold.

08:01.985 --> 08:02.945
It's santa!

08:05.091 --> 08:06.040
Grampa?!

08:06.240 --> 08:07.733
What are you doing in the chimney?

08:07.874 --> 08:09.345
Trying to kill Santa.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.152
What's it to ya?!

08:10.236 --> 08:11.540
What do you have against Santa?

08:11.635 --> 08:15.183
He screwed me over back in WWII!

08:15.470 --> 08:17.812
I was a navy pilot in the Pacific.

08:18.090 --> 08:20.953
Bart, why'd you ask him a follow-up question?

08:21.043 --> 08:22.417
It just slipped out!

08:22.474 --> 08:27.639
Yep, I was a navy pilot in the Pacific, 
along with my big brother cyrus.

08:27.923 --> 08:30.150
Cyrus? You never mentioned him before.

08:30.248 --> 08:34.850
And I'll never mention him again, 
but I loved him all the same.

08:35.374 --> 08:37.158
Okay, Abe, let's win this war quick,

08:37.359 --> 08:40.467
so we can go home and slowly 
give black folks more rights.

08:44.447 --> 08:45.803
Kamikazes at two o'clock!

08:46.024 --> 08:48.695
Well, I don't usually drink after 
lunch, but... oh, my god!

08:48.828 --> 08:51.436
The sky is full of that kind of 
plane that crashes into the boat!

08:53.998 --> 08:56.148
Cyrus, you be careful up there.

08:56.210 --> 08:59.289
Nah, I'm not worried, not as 
long as I have my good luck charm.

09:05.231 --> 09:07.803
Good thing I stole two of 
these off dead soldiers.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.703
Lieutenant, radio my brother and 
tell him to watch his tail!

09:16.982 --> 09:17.603
Quiet, you.

09:17.614 --> 09:19.069
I'm talking to my best gal.

09:19.414 --> 09:21.105
I miss you, too, Bernadette.

09:21.176 --> 09:22.250
You hang up first.

09:22.446 --> 09:25.212
No... you hang up firsT.

09:25.241 --> 09:26.060
No.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.540
You hang up first.

09:27.990 --> 09:28.880
No.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.490
You hang up first.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.380
Cyrus!

09:46.140 --> 09:49.130
You'll pay for that, you haiku-spouting savages!

09:53.260 --> 09:55.240
I wish I tried reefer!

10:27.490 --> 10:29.420
Quit lollygagging and build a fire!

10:29.660 --> 10:31.160
I don't have to listen to you.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.170
On this island, military rank means nothing.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.950
We're in a state of nature where 
the strong of will control the weak.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.450
How dare you drown the king of New Burns Island!

10:44.630 --> 10:48.590
How'd you like to be the archduke 
in charge of coconuts?

10:50.170 --> 10:51.970
No! I give up!

10:52.120 --> 10:53.020
I give up!

10:55.180 --> 10:56.550
Days turned to weeks.

10:56.700 --> 10:57.930
Weeks turned to months.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.990
Months turned back to days.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.630
Even burns was starting to look good to me.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.130
Hey, sailor, my eyes are up here.

11:11.010 --> 11:14.870
By christmas eve, our hopes 
of rescue were fading.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.970
You know, Simpson, we've had our dustups,

11:19.300 --> 11:21.070
so I've made you a little peace offering.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.030
A shaving kit?

11:25.780 --> 11:27.030
Is this pomade?

11:27.050 --> 11:30.460
It's nothing really, just seagull 
brains and snail goo.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.740
Thanks, lieutenant.

11:32.130 --> 11:33.360
Merry christmas.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.540
Incoming!

11:35.840 --> 11:36.740
Is it one of ours?

11:36.890 --> 11:38.220
Who cares? It's christmas.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.370
I want to shoot something.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.340
What in the name of the 
Tennessee valley authority?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.460
Donder! Blitzen!

11:54.810 --> 11:55.360
He's german.

11:55.530 --> 11:56.260
That's good eatin'.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.010
You useless waste of socks!

11:58.110 --> 11:59.060
That ain't no kraut!

11:59.260 --> 12:01.290
We just shot down santa claus!

12:02.000 --> 12:03.720
Oh, thank you, boys.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.720
I guess I must have run into a sudden storm.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.610
Yes, yes.

12:07.610 --> 12:09.310
Everything happens to you.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.690
My sleigh! It's ruined!

12:11.800 --> 12:12.940
Well, we'll get you up and running

12:12.940 --> 12:14.990
or my name ain't young grampa Simpson!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.440
Boys, I'm almost ready.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.270
I'm just missing Prancer...

12:40.500 --> 12:41.320
and Rudolph.

12:45.480 --> 12:49.900
And now to bring joy to boys 
and girls around the world.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.610
Damn it!

12:53.680 --> 12:55.410
Sorry, chuckles, change of plan.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.530
This sleigh is my ticket off this hellhole.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.690
And I'm keeping all the toys for myself!

13:00.160 --> 13:03.030
Because, at heart, I'm just a very wicked child.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.170
You backstabber!

13:09.370 --> 13:11.830
And I let you spoon me.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.260
Let's go, you flying hat rack!

13:39.780 --> 13:40.660
Come on, baby!

13:53.570 --> 13:55.020
Somebody should have beat

13:55.020 --> 13:56.420
you with a tricycle years ago!

14:00.200 --> 14:01.850
Thanks for everything, Abe.

14:02.180 --> 14:03.480
And now I'm off.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.600
I'll be back in a few days

14:05.640 --> 14:08.340
to take you ho-ho-home!

14:11.550 --> 14:14.070
Well, that's the craziest thing I'll ever see.

14:15.270 --> 14:16.170
Except for that!

14:16.820 --> 14:18.070
I waited and waited.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.640
But santa never came back.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.720
If I hadn't invented a jet ski made

14:21.720 --> 14:24.040
of coconuts, I'd have never gotten home.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.180
And then when I did, the war was over

14:26.180 --> 14:28.360
and the nurses were all kissed out.

14:29.940 --> 14:31.630
That's quite a tale, grampa.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.110
You little...

14:33.430 --> 14:35.000
It's true, I tells ya!

14:35.980 --> 14:36.630
It's Santa!

14:38.030 --> 14:40.570
I got an old score to settle.

14:44.470 --> 14:44.870
Doggone it!

14:45.020 --> 14:46.470
I missed him again!

14:52.530 --> 14:54.900
My brother's lucky watch!

14:55.210 --> 14:56.640
Santa must have left it.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.560
Cyrus, I miss you every day.

14:59.810 --> 15:01.490
He misses you, too.

15:01.610 --> 15:04.080
wait! He, what, who?!

15:04.160 --> 15:06.740
Your brother didn't die in the war, Abe.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.469
He crashed into Tahiti.

15:09.849 --> 15:11.490
And he liked it so much, he never left.

15:11.863 --> 15:13.875
And now, if you like,

15:14.063 --> 15:15.120
I'll take you to him.

15:15.345 --> 15:16.718
Will we be back for the

15:17.001 --> 15:18.135
tournament of roses parade?

15:18.396 --> 15:19.440
Probably not.

15:19.763 --> 15:21.171
Good, I hate that crap.

15:21.369 --> 15:22.822
Yeah, me, too.

15:23.093 --> 15:26.372
Santa, one thing's still bugging me.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.872
Why didn't you ever come back to pick me up?

15:28.123 --> 15:31.980
I kept putting it off and then 
I was just too embarrassed.

15:32.419 --> 15:34.034
Sorry I never called, Abe.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.842
I was too busy with my 15 native wives.

15:41.793 --> 15:44.839
15! Whoa, that sounds like a lot of sex!

15:45.316 --> 15:47.337
I said wives, not girlfriends.

15:49.659 --> 15:51.716
No poko-miku for Cyrus!

16:17.148 --> 16:17.863
oh my god, it's over.

16:18.092 --> 16:19.319
We're free!

16:19.639 --> 16:20.903
It's not over. It's just intermission.

16:21.258 --> 16:22.640
I said we're free!

16:24.927 --> 16:26.204
we're still doing act two.

16:26.704 --> 16:27.844
I'll be the audience.

16:28.235 --> 16:29.419
Boo! This is terrible!

16:30.365 --> 16:33.691
I hope I never hear that 
god-awful nutcracker music again.

16:34.006 --> 16:34.658
I don't know, dad.

16:34.965 --> 16:36.960
This time of year, everybody does it,

16:37.187 --> 16:39.439
'cause you don't have to 
pay for the music rights.

16:39.764 --> 16:40.658
Really?

16:41.009 --> 16:42.570
I've still gotta bake my christmas pie

16:43.031 --> 16:45.845
I've gotta get dad a lousy tie.

16:46.121 --> 16:47.887
Christmas crowds is what I hate

16:48.111 --> 16:49.357
no time left to procrastinate.

16:49.615 --> 16:51.146
So move your ass and let me pass.

16:51.556 --> 16:52.723
'cause christmas eve is here

16:55.312 --> 16:57.862
Why is this Santa suit so snug?

16:58.111 --> 16:59.763
Why should I care?

16:59.997 --> 17:00.878
It's all humbug I've jacked 
my prices up so high

17:01.326 --> 17:04.013
but there's no junk these saps

17:04.214 --> 17:05.531
won't buy last year's eggnog,

17:05.832 --> 17:06.974
a green hot dog...

17:07.183 --> 17:08.785
'cause Christmas eve is here!

17:22.077 --> 17:24.467
These holiday cookies swell my fat cat

17:24.856 --> 17:27.106
even though we're not gentile,

17:28.571 --> 17:30.804
we'll get together for a while

17:31.027 --> 17:31.787
to shoot the breeze

17:31.990 --> 17:32.647
and eat chinese

17:32.910 --> 17:34.400
'cause christmas eve is here

17:34.674 --> 17:39.728
Christmas is a family day

17:39.922 --> 17:42.540
I told grampa we'd be away he's at the door,

17:42.756 --> 17:44.610
let's hit the floor 'cause 
christmas eve is here fine.

17:46.727 --> 17:50.200
I'll spend christmas eve with the raccoons.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.879
You got me a gift?

17:57.266 --> 17:59.080
Rancid lard?!

17:59.638 --> 18:00.965
You shouldn't have.

18:02.045 --> 18:03.727
Every year at this time, I show

18:03.961 --> 18:05.794
what's probably my most requested clip.

18:06.101 --> 18:07.676
Roll it, Freddie.

18:08.031 --> 18:10.394
It's the most wonderful time of the year...

18:10.654 --> 18:18.346
"Give the audience snowballs," they said.

18:18.517 --> 18:19.790
"It'll be cute," they said.

18:26.530 --> 18:27.529
Okay, time for my annual holiday tradition:

18:28.193 --> 18:29.777
Attempting to kill myself.

19:04.377 --> 19:04.973
What's it say?

19:05.244 --> 19:06.413
Barn, as a special gift to me 
this year, will you kill me?

19:06.655 --> 19:07.568
But I already got you a wool hat.

19:07.994 --> 19:09.658
Maybe next year?

19:10.846 --> 19:12.304
Merry christmas, Homie.

19:12.912 --> 19:14.619
I think you're really gonna like this.

19:15.663 --> 19:16.779
That's great.

19:17.102 --> 19:19.334
Now I'll just get my present for you,

19:19.817 --> 19:21.811
which is...

19:22.148 --> 19:23.535
right outside the door.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.051
Oh, my god, I forgot to get Marge a present!

19:28.505 --> 19:31.629
I need a present for my wife

19:31.835 --> 19:33.428
or I'll have no sex for life

19:33.672 --> 19:34.820
diamond ring, a vase by ming

19:35.025 --> 19:36.520
some kinda useful kitchen thing

19:36.921 --> 19:38.258
I need a store I can break into

19:38.463 --> 19:39.727
or a place run by a HDU

19:39.957 --> 19:44.385
the christmas rush has cleaned me out

19:44.572 --> 19:45.922
I just have jerky made of trout.

19:46.351 --> 20:23.838
I knew you'd forget,

20:24.184 --> 20:28.724
so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me.

20:31.505 --> 20:32.859
It's just what I wanted.

20:33.444 --> 20:35.587
Here, Marge, this is for you.

20:52.747 --> 20:57.302
18 wheels, and they all missed me.

20:58.305 --> 21:04.843
