Previously on The O.C.:

00:04.526 --> 00:05.686
Good-bye, Lance.

00:08.646 --> 00:09.366
Where have you been?

00:09.446 --> 00:10.446
You're leaving?

00:10.966 --> 00:13.046
Good luck with your
new job, Carter.

00:13.126 --> 00:14.086
So long, Kirsten

00:15.286 --> 00:18.166
- No one's ever been this nice to me.
- Yeah, 'cause you're Ryan's brother.

00:18.166 --> 00:21.646
- No, it is more than that.
- Get off of me.

00:35.726 --> 00:38.406
Kirsten, did the paper come today?
I can't find it!

00:38.406 --> 00:41.006
Uh, yeah! I put it
on the couch in the living room!

00:46.806 --> 00:48.406
Do you think I look
at all like Tony Blair?

00:48.526 --> 00:50.726
- Uh... You have nicer hair.
- Thank you.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.326
- Good hair...
- Mm-hmm.

00:52.406 --> 00:53.766
Leader of Great Britain.

00:53.766 --> 00:55.406
- I would call that a wash.
- Mm-hmm.

00:55.486 --> 00:58.646
- What you drinking?
- Oh, tomato juice. Lots of anti-oxidants.

00:59.206 --> 01:00.526
So what do you think of this?

01:01.046 --> 01:03.246
- Palm Springs.
- Palm Springs?

01:04.861 --> 01:08.581
This weekend.
You... me... and the desert.

01:08.661 --> 01:11.221
Oh, Sandy, I know we talked
about a weekend, but right now...

01:11.221 --> 01:13.461
Hey, you asked for my opinion,
remember? Good Morning.

01:13.461 --> 01:16.021
Yeah, but I just really wanted you
to agree with me, man. Morning.

01:16.021 --> 01:17.501
Morning. What's up?

01:17.621 --> 01:20.861
Well, today's the first day
back from spring break, and

01:20.941 --> 01:25.781
I was planning on telling Summer about
that little misunderstanding in Miami.

01:25.901 --> 01:28.101
Where you licked the whipped cream off
the girl's naked stomach and

01:28.101 --> 01:29.461
ate the cherry out of her mouth.

01:29.501 --> 01:30.981
And why are you going
to tell her, again?

01:30.981 --> 01:32.341
Because I have a conscience.

01:32.341 --> 01:35.101
And it'll be on national television
so she'll find out sooner or later.

01:35.101 --> 01:37.621
Look, I know the idea
of telling her is scary, but

01:37.901 --> 01:41.821
believe me, when you start hiding
things... that's when the trouble starts.

01:42.301 --> 01:44.141
All right, let's go.
We're late. Come on.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.821
Well, there goes the weekend.

01:49.221 --> 01:51.941
Unless we drive up Sunday morning
and I take Monday off.

01:54.981 --> 02:01.941
- You're right. We need this.
- Wow. I'll make the plans.

02:24.461 --> 02:27.301
Synchro Scidou
pour Forom.com

03:16.341 --> 03:18.821
- Hello?
- Marissa, don't hang up, okay?

03:18.901 --> 03:21.901
- Look, I told you to stop calling me.
- Let me exp...

03:25.781 --> 03:27.461
I guess she didn't want to chat.

03:29.781 --> 03:33.821
What happened? Stable boy
get fresh with the princess?

03:37.301 --> 03:38.621
Don't you have school?

03:39.221 --> 03:41.701
I was hoping... we could...

03:42.741 --> 03:43.861
I'll pass.

03:45.941 --> 03:46.941
You know...

03:47.021 --> 03:49.541
there's not many girls that would
spend the night with a guy...

03:49.621 --> 03:52.261
and not only not mind him calling
another girl the next morning,

03:52.901 --> 03:54.701
but still be up for round two.

03:55.701 --> 03:57.901
Sure you're not taking me for granted?

04:03.381 --> 04:04.981
Look, we both know what this is.

04:08.621 --> 04:11.581
Well... we know I'm not Marissa.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.421
I leave my marks on your back.

04:33.101 --> 04:36.141
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Cohen.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.221
Okay, uh...

04:38.581 --> 04:41.861
The easiest way for me to do this
is just gonna be for me to say it,

04:41.981 --> 04:46.821
but before I do, I want you to know
how totally, you know, awful...

04:46.821 --> 04:48.181
- I know.
- What?

04:48.581 --> 04:51.861
Miami. Your whipped cream girl.
We do have cable.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.541
- So you saw me?
- I saw you.

04:57.541 --> 04:59.821
Okay, so look, I know you're angry,
and that's...

05:00.301 --> 05:02.061
- Not really.
- Perfectly...

05:05.061 --> 05:07.181
- You're not?
- Uh-uh.

05:08.661 --> 05:11.861
You know, I really thought things
were going to be different this time,

05:11.981 --> 05:13.901
but you haven't changed at all.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.381
You found new and even more
public ways of disappointing me.

05:20.501 --> 05:21.861
Zach and I kissed.

05:23.581 --> 05:24.541
- What?
- Yeah.

05:24.621 --> 05:28.381
We were having dinner and you came
on TV and that stupid...

05:28.381 --> 05:30.021
Okay. You know what?
Fine. That's okay.

05:30.021 --> 05:36.341
You've, you know, seen me and you kissed.
Just a quick, cousinly... What else happened?

05:36.421 --> 05:38.621
Nothing... much.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.901
- So what does this mean?
- I don't know.

05:45.621 --> 05:47.421
It shouldn't be this hard.

05:56.901 --> 06:00.461
Ah! There you are.
Just in time for your surprise.

06:00.581 --> 06:01.581
I'm late for work.

06:02.181 --> 06:03.821
You'll want to make time for this.

06:06.181 --> 06:08.901
- Bon appÃ©tit.
- What is that?

06:08.941 --> 06:13.781
Eggs Benedict. My specialty. Well,
my new specialty. It's my first time.

06:13.861 --> 06:15.381
I already ate breakfast.

06:15.421 --> 06:17.701
Well, consider this a midmorning snack.

06:17.821 --> 06:22.101
I was going to give it to you at 7:00, but
it took a little longer than I expected.

06:22.221 --> 06:26.101
You spent two hours making eggs Benedict
for a man with a heart condition?

06:26.221 --> 06:28.821
Doesn't that seem
a little insane to you?

06:31.501 --> 06:33.221
I'm trying to make an effort here, Cal.

06:33.901 --> 06:37.221
If nothing else,
I expect you to acknowledge that.

06:37.261 --> 06:40.141
I do. A wasted effort.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.141
- I have to go.
- Why do I even try?

06:43.221 --> 06:45.621
I ask myself the same question.

06:52.581 --> 06:56.181
Hey. Oh. Sorry.
You okay?

06:56.261 --> 07:00.421
Uh, yeah. No, I guess I'm just not used
to the hallway kiss yet.

07:01.661 --> 07:05.101
- Oh, sure. Of course.
- Um... So, tell me, how was Miami?

07:05.421 --> 07:09.541
Uh, it was a lot like Orange County.
How about you?

07:10.221 --> 07:11.901
Anything crazy happen while I was gone?

07:11.981 --> 07:15.701
No. No, it was pretty much
just business as usual.

07:16.301 --> 07:18.061
So we still have a date.
How's your weekend?

07:18.461 --> 07:21.821
- Oh. Um...
- What, you got something?

07:21.901 --> 07:25.621
No, no, it's just my mom wanted to go
shopping, but this weekend's great.

07:25.741 --> 07:29.781
Okay, great. So... Um... well,
let's do something special.

07:29.981 --> 07:33.021
- Something you want to do?
- Um... no, nothing special.

07:33.741 --> 07:36.181
I mean, nothing in particular.
It'll be special.

07:36.221 --> 07:38.821
So, uh, let's just talk
about it later, okay?

07:39.941 --> 07:41.701
Yeah, I guess.

07:45.821 --> 07:49.021
Come in!
Oh, hi, Claire. What is it?

07:49.261 --> 07:50.781
The men were cleaning out
Carter's office

07:50.861 --> 07:53.461
and they found this with a note saying
it should be given to you.

07:53.581 --> 07:55.901
Oh, thank you. You can put it there.

08:20.021 --> 08:23.381
- Hey, Summer. Wait.
- Hey, Zach.

08:23.461 --> 08:27.541
Um, I need to, uh... Here.

08:32.421 --> 08:35.900
- Did you talk to Seth?
- Yeah. I told him everything.

08:36.020 --> 08:37.981
Okay, so what does that mean about us?

08:38.341 --> 08:39.981
Zach, I can't do this right now.

08:39.981 --> 08:43.421
I need to know if what happened the
other night was just like a revenge thing

08:43.501 --> 08:45.021
or if it was something more.

08:45.101 --> 08:52.021
Honestly, in the moment, mostly revenge,
but also, I guess, something more.

08:53.541 --> 08:58.101
Well, well, well. If it isn't
my old friend, the big, fat traitor.

08:58.181 --> 08:59.781
- Hey, Seth.
- Cohen?

08:59.861 --> 09:01.821
Relax, Summer. I won't make a scene.

09:02.621 --> 09:04.061
How can you even look
at yourself in the mirror?

09:04.061 --> 09:05.701
Look, Seth, I-I need
to tell you something.

09:05.701 --> 09:07.421
You know what? Save your apology.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.181
It's not an apology.
I'm quitting the comic.

09:10.181 --> 09:11.061
- What?
- What?

09:11.061 --> 09:13.421
It's just, it's caused too many problems
between me and Summer.

09:13.501 --> 09:15.781
- It's not worth it.
- Yeah, but the launch party's Saturday.

09:15.861 --> 09:18.221
Zach, you can't.
It means too much to you.

09:18.341 --> 09:20.341
Not as much as you do.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.021
I have to go.

09:29.061 --> 09:31.181
I see what you're doing.
Let me tell you something.

09:31.341 --> 09:33.101
It's not going to work, okay?

09:33.221 --> 09:36.661
She will see it for the
cheap ploy that it is... eventually.

09:36.741 --> 09:40.061
Look, Seth,
I've always liked you, but,

09:40.101 --> 09:43.221
if I have to sacrifice our friendship
to be with Summer, I'll do it.

09:43.221 --> 09:45.901
Amazing. This whole time,
I thought you were a nice guy.

09:45.901 --> 09:49.421
Wake up. I'm a water polo player.
We're never nice guys.

09:49.421 --> 09:51.901
Well, looks like I won't have to worry
about adding you to Atomic County.

09:51.901 --> 09:55.621
You're already there, the demon water polo
player, the Ironist's nemesis.

09:55.621 --> 09:58.981
And it's going to take a little bit more than
quick quips and pop- culture-laden bromides

09:58.981 --> 10:00.461
to win Little Miss Vixen.

10:00.541 --> 10:03.021
- So it's war.
- It's war.

10:08.461 --> 10:09.621
My locker's this way.

10:09.621 --> 10:11.021
- So is mine.
- Fine.

10:11.141 --> 10:12.741
Stay on that side of the hall.

10:31.981 --> 10:33.221
What are you doing?

10:33.421 --> 10:38.741
Summer. Hey, I was, uh...
I was, uh, waiting for you.

10:39.661 --> 10:42.821
Look, my car's like completely out of gas,
so would you give me a ride?

10:42.861 --> 10:44.181
Sure. Come on.

10:44.461 --> 10:48.861
Um, the only thing is, I left a book inside,
so could you pick me up around back?

10:49.341 --> 10:50.781
Yeah. Whatever.

11:03.798 --> 11:06.638
Oh, uh, Sandy, I thought you, you'd gone

11:06.718 --> 11:08.718
No, no.
My first meeting's not till 10:00.

11:09.318 --> 11:12.598
I hope you don't mind.
I, uh, I finished the tomato juice.

11:13.558 --> 11:14.718
But there's coffee.

11:15.118 --> 11:17.198
You know, I'm just gonna go.
I'm a little late.

11:18.198 --> 11:20.998
Hey, I made a reservation
at Karake in Palm Springs.

11:21.078 --> 11:24.278
It's supposed to be,
you know, really romantic.

11:24.558 --> 11:28.398
Oh, yeah, um, I checked my schedule.
I don't think I can take Monday.

11:28.518 --> 11:31.478
Come on. It's just one day.

11:31.598 --> 11:34.558
I know, I'm-I'm sorry.
Maybe in a couple weeks?

11:34.758 --> 11:37.078
- But we'll talk about it tonight, okay?
- All right.

11:37.838 --> 11:41.958
- Hey, I don't get a kiss?
- Of course.

11:45.398 --> 11:49.878
- Oh, is that new?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I got it at Featherbrook.

11:49.878 --> 11:51.678
I picked it up at the gift shop.

11:54.158 --> 11:58.198
Well, it suits you. Have a good day.

12:15.758 --> 12:17.838
Hey, Zach, thanks
for coming on such short notice.

12:18.318 --> 12:20.918
Well, uh, let's just go
over the details of the launch.

12:20.998 --> 12:23.798
Yeah, listen, Reed,
I, uh, I only came here today

12:23.798 --> 12:26.998
to let you know that I have
to pull out of the comic.

12:29.918 --> 12:32.038
- Excuse me?
- Personal reasons,

12:32.038 --> 12:35.838
um, which I'm sure Seth can fill
you in on at a later date.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.638
But I wanted to tell you
face-to-face. I'm sorry.

12:39.678 --> 12:43.398
Okay, well, I know that you're young and
it's a comic book and it's fun, fun, fun,

12:43.398 --> 12:47.278
but to us, this is a business,
and you signed a contract.

12:47.398 --> 12:49.558
So unless you want to deal
with a lawsuit for the next four years,

12:49.558 --> 12:51.718
I suggest you stay where you are,
you order a sandwich,

12:51.718 --> 12:53.838
and let's go over
the details of the launch.

12:57.558 --> 12:59.598
- You did this.
- Hmm?

12:59.718 --> 13:02.198
Did you threaten to pull out, too,
if she didn't force me back in?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.118
Is that what you did?

13:03.118 --> 13:05.918
Oh, buddy, Zach, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:05.958 --> 13:08.238
I'm glad you're back in, if that's
what's going on, but that's it.

13:08.318 --> 13:09.878
So what's it going to be, gorgeous?

13:09.878 --> 13:12.318
Am I calling my lawyers, or are you
going to order a crab sandwich?

13:13.758 --> 13:15.038
Crab sandwich.

13:15.158 --> 13:20.278
So what's today's heart attack special,
Julie? Deep-fried ribs? Steak tartare?

13:20.718 --> 13:23.038
That Supersize guy ought
to spend some time with you.

13:23.118 --> 13:27.678
This came for you at the house. Listen,
Cal, we need to talk to a counselor.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.078
Excuse me?

13:29.398 --> 13:31.038
A counselor. A professional.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.798
Someone who can penetrate that
fortress of solitude you've erected.

13:34.838 --> 13:37.918
Of all your ideas,
that has got to be the worst.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.718
Well, then, I'm out.

13:39.878 --> 13:43.478
I mean, you're not interested in my cooking.
You're certainly not interested in my body.

13:43.478 --> 13:46.638
You said you wanted to try
and make this marriage work.

13:49.518 --> 13:55.398
You may have a point that I have
been letting you do all the work.

13:56.158 --> 13:58.318
I'm just not a counselor sort of guy;

13:58.518 --> 14:01.558
sitting on a couch,
talking about my needs.

14:02.358 --> 14:05.078
How about a date? Tomorrow night,
The Arches.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.078
I will try.

14:11.278 --> 14:12.678
We can make this work.

14:25.558 --> 14:26.958
S andy?

14:31.158 --> 14:32.438
Hello?

15:10.958 --> 15:12.958
Hi, Carter, it's, it's me.

15:13.998 --> 15:17.158
I, uh, wanted to thank you
for the necklace. It's beautiful.

15:17.478 --> 15:18.638
And...

15:21.198 --> 15:25.038
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called.
Please don't call back.

15:43.598 --> 15:48.358
- Jess? Marissa's pool? Floater girl?
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.798
And you're Ryan.
Trey and I've been hanging out.

15:51.958 --> 15:54.398
Ah, you and Trey.
Just what I need is more trouble.

15:54.798 --> 15:58.158
You think I'm trouble? You might be
even cuter than your brother.

16:01.358 --> 16:04.358
- Listen, I gotta...
- Oh, right. Marissa's waiting.

16:04.878 --> 16:06.318
Can't keep Marissa waiting.

16:07.478 --> 16:09.478
Think I could borrow a pen?

16:11.478 --> 16:12.678
Thanks.

16:16.078 --> 16:17.838
Thanks, Ryan. You're a sport.

16:23.238 --> 16:24.158
Marissa.

16:24.278 --> 16:26.918
- What are you doing here?
- Look, just let me explain, okay?

16:27.158 --> 16:28.558
There's nothing,you can say to me
that I want to hear.

16:28.558 --> 16:30.318
- Just wait.
- Let go of me!

16:30.518 --> 16:33.638
- Marissa, hi.
- Hey.

16:34.238 --> 16:35.638
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Ry.

16:35.798 --> 16:37.118
- How you doing?
- What are you doing here?

16:37.198 --> 16:40.678
Nothing. Just came to thank Marissa
for the bait shop gig. It's really good.

16:44.158 --> 16:48.278
- What'd you do to your head?
- Nothing. Just banged it on a cabinet.

16:49.438 --> 16:51.078
So what's up?
You guys want to grab a bite?

16:51.118 --> 16:55.198
No. I have to get home.
You know, my mom needs help.

16:55.398 --> 16:57.118
Yeah, I should probably
get back to work.

16:57.398 --> 17:00.078
- But, uh, I want to hear about Miami.
- Definitely.

17:02.118 --> 17:05.438
- Hey, everything all right?
- Yeah.

17:05.518 --> 17:08.397
Yeah, you know,
just my mom's usual insanity.

17:08.518 --> 17:13.157
Got ya. So, um, tomorrow night
is Seth's comic-book thing.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.278
I figure we hit that,
then maybe grab dinner?

17:15.438 --> 17:18.278
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? I mean, if you want.

17:18.358 --> 17:22.397
Yeah, sure. And I promise
I'll be in a better mood by then.

17:22.838 --> 17:24.038
Okay.

17:34.118 --> 17:36.598
<i>music from Dial M for Murder playing on TV </i>

17:39.198 --> 17:40.998
<i>Let me get you another drink.</i>

17:42.478 --> 17:44.318
Honey, I'm home!

17:45.598 --> 17:47.238
Hey, I thought we'd go out tonight.

17:48.038 --> 17:50.158
I made a reservation
at that fancy new steak joint.

17:50.158 --> 17:54.158
You know, the one with the really heavy
silverware. What do you say?

17:55.718 --> 17:56.758
Honey?

18:15.518 --> 18:19.558
Let's get you to bed.
Come on. One, two.

18:39.518 --> 18:43.798
Rise and shine.
Rise and shine.

18:44.278 --> 18:46.558
It's a beautiful morning.

18:47.758 --> 18:50.278
Come on.
Look what I brought you.

18:52.318 --> 18:54.318
Oh. Sandy...

18:54.438 --> 18:56.998
Black coffee, bacon,
those little waffles you like so much,

18:56.998 --> 19:00.678
whipped butter, two fried eggs,
fruit and O.J. I call it The Whaler.

19:00.718 --> 19:03.678
How can I resist? Thank you.

19:06.358 --> 19:08.438
Well, you were out cold
when I got home last night.

19:08.558 --> 19:11.558
Yeah. Well, I was exhausted; long week.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.038
Seemed like it was more than exhaustion.

19:15.718 --> 19:16.958
What do you mean?

19:17.558 --> 19:19.438
I'm worried about
how much you're drinking.

19:20.078 --> 19:24.118
I... I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm fine.
I mean, I was exhausted.

19:24.358 --> 19:25.918
You know, I had a couple
of drinks, so what?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.158
Well, I'm not just
talking about last night.

19:29.478 --> 19:32.478
- Have you been watching me?
- We do live together.

19:32.958 --> 19:36.878
- Should I be concerned?
- I'm fine.

19:38.158 --> 19:43.438
Look, maybe I've been drinking more
than usual, but I'll cut down, okay?

19:44.038 --> 19:47.518
So it's not something at work,
taking on too much?

19:50.078 --> 19:53.758
- Is it that Carter left?
- What?

19:53.838 --> 19:58.038
He left very suddenly.
So I figured...

19:58.598 --> 20:00.678
maybe you had to do
some of his work, too.

20:01.558 --> 20:06.998
I'm fine. And I'd appreciate it
if you'd trust me. I have to shower.

20:10.438 --> 20:14.198
- I'll put this in the microwave.
- Don't bother, I'm not hungry.

20:24.198 --> 20:28.758
You like that? Here's a little something
your master Yoda never taught you.

20:34.598 --> 20:36.918
You just threw your light
saber at me and killed me.

20:37.478 --> 20:39.038
I didn't know you could
throw your light saber.

20:39.118 --> 20:41.958
- Yeah, new game; who knew?
- Damn.

20:42.598 --> 20:45.638
Well, it's too bad Marissa's not here.
The ladies can't resist a young Jedi.

20:45.838 --> 20:47.638
Yeah, I don't know about that.

20:48.118 --> 20:50.078
- Why, you guys in a fight?
- I don't know.

20:50.278 --> 20:53.678
Ever since I got back from Miami, she's
been acting kind of nervous around me.

20:53.838 --> 20:55.638
Well, you could talk to Summer except

20:55.718 --> 20:59.518
you cannot because she's off limits until
phase two of Zach attack is complete.

20:59.878 --> 21:02.998
But, uh, I think Trey was around last
week, right? Maybe he knows something.

21:03.238 --> 21:04.918
- Did you say "phase two"?
- Yeah, see...

21:04.998 --> 21:07.918
Zach being in the comic book does me
no good unless Summer knows about it.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.918
And it ain't like
he's going to tell her.

21:12.198 --> 21:18.478
Hello. Hey. Excellent. Is Guy
Smiley still with her? Okay, stay...

21:19.198 --> 21:23.078
No, no, Leon, you can't leave, I don't care if
you have swim lessons. I'll be there in a minute.

21:24.718 --> 21:28.558
Seth, please tell me you're not using the
comic book club to spy on Summer and Zach.

21:33.718 --> 21:35.878
- Hey, Leon, they still in there?
- They just paid.

21:38.078 --> 21:40.038
Is Zach really trying
to destroy the comic book club?

21:40.038 --> 21:42.878
What?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, totally.

21:42.998 --> 21:45.038
Seth, I need to get something to eat.
My blood sugar's all low.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.478
Okay, shh! I'll be back. Stay there.

21:50.838 --> 21:53.758
Summer, Zach, hey. What a surprise.

21:53.838 --> 21:55.558
Cohen, what are you doing here?

21:55.638 --> 21:59.958
Uh... just filling up the tank, you know.
Got a big day, got the launch party tonight.

22:00.038 --> 22:03.878
Hey, Reed wanted me to tell you we should
get there a half hour early tonight, okay?

22:03.878 --> 22:06.278
Something about a Wizard
magazine interview.

22:06.398 --> 22:10.398
Hey, dementia boy. Zach quit
your stupid comic book, remember?

22:10.478 --> 22:14.318
Oh, did you not tell her yet?
Oh.

22:14.798 --> 22:17.558
Oh, did I put my foot in it again?

22:17.638 --> 22:19.718
- What's he talking about?
- I was going to tell you.

22:19.718 --> 22:22.278
I'm just gonna go. I'm sorry.

22:40.998 --> 22:44.198
- Yo!
- Yo.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.478
Hey, man, got you working, huh?

22:51.558 --> 22:55.038
Oh, yeah. Real slave drivers.
What's up?

22:55.318 --> 22:56.598
Nothing. Listen...

22:57.558 --> 23:00.318
I got to ask you something. Marissa's been
acting a little weird since I got back.

23:00.318 --> 23:03.918
She didn't happen to say anything
when you guys were hanging out, did she?

23:04.278 --> 23:05.678
Nope. I don't think so.

23:05.678 --> 23:06.718
You sure, you didn't notice anything?

23:06.718 --> 23:09.838
Uh, look, man, I got a lot of work to do.
So, no offense, but...

23:09.998 --> 23:11.758
- I don't want him to think I'm slacking.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:11.798 --> 23:14.638
But, uh, hey, man.
We'll talk later, all right?

23:17.598 --> 23:22.158
- Well, well... if it isn't baby brother.
- I just came by to see Trey.

23:22.598 --> 23:25.078
Me, too.
But I can be talked out of it.

23:25.438 --> 23:28.678
Look, whatever's going on between you two,
he needs time to get his life back together.

23:28.758 --> 23:30.998
Come on, it's not like we're serious.

23:31.278 --> 23:34.358
I mean, how could we be?
He's clearly obsessed with...

23:36.278 --> 23:37.438
Well, with someone else.

23:37.558 --> 23:39.318
You know what?
Fine. I'm not getting involved.

23:39.638 --> 23:42.198
Well, the fact is, Ryan...

23:43.518 --> 23:45.998
I've always had this fantasy
about two brothers.

23:46.398 --> 23:48.118
I think that's gonna stay a fantasy.

23:49.038 --> 23:52.078
I get it. I used to think
it was strange, too.

23:52.598 --> 23:56.038
But, apparently, I'm not the only one
into the brother thing.

24:01.638 --> 24:02.798
I have a problem.

24:03.598 --> 24:04.998
Well, come on in and join the party.

24:04.998 --> 24:09.318
Okay, I have been shopping all afternoon
and... What are you doing?

24:09.318 --> 24:14.158
I'm just erasing every vestige
of Seth and Zach from my life.

24:14.238 --> 24:16.598
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
Reed can have them.

24:19.038 --> 24:19.958
What's up?

24:20.758 --> 24:25.678
Okay, so I have this really important date
with Ryan later, and I need it to be perfect.

24:25.918 --> 24:27.598
I can't figure out what to wear.

24:27.718 --> 24:30.678
Please. You could dress as a grimmith
and stop traffic.

24:31.998 --> 24:34.198
Man, I look good in this picture.

24:37.278 --> 24:42.198
- Okay. What do you think?
- Well... Hmm. Let me see.

24:42.798 --> 24:44.958
- What is that?
- What? What?

24:45.398 --> 24:47.438
- That.
- Ouch. Ow!

24:47.558 --> 24:49.878
Coop, what were...
you've been playing rugby?

24:49.878 --> 24:52.118
Yeah, well, um... I just slipped.

24:52.878 --> 24:55.838
- And fell on your collarbone?
- Wait. So, who's Reed?

24:55.838 --> 24:57.878
Oh, she's that busty comic book tart

24:57.878 --> 25:01.558
that turned Seth into an egomaniac by
agreeing to publish his graphic novel,

25:01.678 --> 25:04.398
and then threatened to sue Zach
if he pulled out of the comic.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.358
Oh, my God, this is so her fault.

25:07.358 --> 25:09.198
- What are you talking about?
- Well, don't you see?

25:09.278 --> 25:11.798
Before she came,
there was no scheming, no fighting.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.078
The comic book was deader than dead.

25:14.998 --> 25:16.198
Oh.

25:17.438 --> 25:21.318
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Uh-uh. Nobody messes with my men but me.

25:21.878 --> 25:23.718
Oh, it ass-kicking time, Coop.

25:25.638 --> 25:27.918
Wear the black.
He won't know what hit him.

25:30.718 --> 25:34.398
- Julie. What are you doing here?
- I need to talk.

25:36.198 --> 25:37.678
Well, come into the kitchen.

25:38.398 --> 25:39.558
You want a drink?

25:40.078 --> 25:41.478
Isn't it a little bit early?

25:43.118 --> 25:46.678
- What do you want to talk about?
- Uh, well, your father.

25:47.118 --> 25:50.958
- Mm. It's not too early.
- Good point. Okay, here's the thing.

25:51.358 --> 25:55.118
Has he said anything to you,
uh, about us?

25:55.838 --> 25:59.398
My dad doesn't exactly tell me
about his romantic life.

25:59.598 --> 26:01.158
Yeah. I figured.

26:01.438 --> 26:05.078
It's just that I really, really want
this marriage to work, Kiki. I mean, ..

26:05.638 --> 26:10.558
he says he does, but... I mean, I don't
know if he means it. I mean, he's...

26:12.598 --> 26:15.518
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

26:15.598 --> 26:18.438
- How much vodka did you put in this?
- Normal amount.

26:18.958 --> 26:23.278
- Little less.
- Okay. Um... is everything all right?

26:23.398 --> 26:24.878
- Where's Sandy?
- Out.

26:24.878 --> 26:27.398
Mm-hmm. Did something happen?
Did you two have a fight?

26:27.438 --> 26:32.598
No. Yes.
Oh, God, I don't know.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.158
Seems like we've been
fighting since September.

26:36.998 --> 26:37.998
Kirsten...

26:38.998 --> 26:43.038
I know that I'm probably the last person in
the world you want to bear your soul to, but

26:43.198 --> 26:45.878
it's got to be better than getting
smashed in the middle of the day.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.598
- What happened?
- What happened?

26:51.078 --> 26:54.438
The boys left for the summer,
Sandy and I stopped communicating,

26:54.518 --> 26:57.038
Rebecca Bloom came along
and made things worse...

26:58.558 --> 27:02.238
- and then Carter.
- Well, he was cute.

27:05.318 --> 27:12.958
Something happened between me and Sandy.
This wall came between us.

27:13.718 --> 27:18.758
And Carter just... made me feel
less alone. Like Sandy used to.

27:21.798 --> 27:23.198
And now he's gone.

27:28.078 --> 27:30.558
Make sure Kid Chino's
not blocking Cosmo Girl.

27:33.518 --> 27:34.678
I have a question.

27:36.318 --> 27:41.238
Hmm. Well, where's your cutout?
Or have they not made Super Bitch yet?

27:41.718 --> 27:43.158
Is this about Seth and Zach?

27:43.238 --> 27:48.958
You and your comic have turned
those two idiots into complete... idiots.

27:49.038 --> 27:52.278
Graphic novel. And I'm trying
to run a business.

27:52.398 --> 27:54.438
You have played one against the other,

27:54.438 --> 27:58.078
manipulating Seth, and then threatening Zach
so you could end up with all of the power.

27:58.078 --> 27:59.518
I'm sorry that you feel that way.

27:59.518 --> 28:01.558
Well, you're gonna be, because
I'm going to tell them both

28:01.558 --> 28:05.558
if either of them has anything to do with
you, I'm never speaking to them again.

28:05.878 --> 28:08.558
Summer, Seth and Zach have talent.
They could have careers in comics,

28:08.558 --> 28:10.838
but you are the Nico of the group.

28:10.918 --> 28:13.598
I'm sorry.
I-I don't get references before 1990.

28:13.718 --> 28:15.998
It's your picture
people are gonna ask for.

28:16.398 --> 28:18.838
It's your face on the magazine covers.

28:18.838 --> 28:24.278
What do you want, a career in fashion,
movies? This is the perfect launching pad.

28:24.598 --> 28:27.478
And do you really think I'll be able to
control them once you have the limelight?

28:27.718 --> 28:31.878
- It'll be your show.
- You're manipulating me.

28:32.438 --> 28:34.358
But I think I like what you're saying.

28:34.678 --> 28:37.678
I have some outfits I want to show you,
but first, tell me about this Super Bitch.

28:37.678 --> 28:39.758
Do you think she could support
her own comic?

28:44.838 --> 28:46.758
- Hey.
- Hey. I was gonna pick you up.

28:46.758 --> 28:48.398
Oh, it's okay. I wanted to surprise you.

28:49.558 --> 28:51.878
Um, is this okay for
a comic book launch?

28:52.358 --> 28:53.718
It'll do.

28:58.998 --> 29:06.038
So, listen, um... you've been, um...
All right, all right. Is everything okay?

29:08.358 --> 29:10.038
Why don't you tell me?

29:53.558 --> 29:56.718
<i>- No one's ever been this nice to me.
- Yeah, 'cause you're Ryan's brother.</i>

29:56.878 --> 29:59.998
<i>No, it has been more than that.
One night. No one needs to know.</i>

29:59.998 --> 30:01.958
<i>Get off of me!</i>

30:11.238 --> 30:13.278
<i>Nobody needs to know.</i>

30:14.998 --> 30:16.158
What's wrong?

30:16.358 --> 30:17.758
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

30:17.838 --> 30:20.638
I thought I could, but it's been
too long. Too much has happened.

30:20.638 --> 30:21.198
Okay, all right.

30:21.198 --> 30:23.158
- I'm sorry.
- Let's talk...

30:31.078 --> 30:32.078
Where have you been?

30:33.838 --> 30:35.238
I was dropping your car off,

30:35.558 --> 30:38.598
you know, at the shop.
It was making a weird noise.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.358
- I got you a rental.
- Oh, thanks.

30:43.398 --> 30:44.478
We need to talk.

30:44.598 --> 30:46.638
Oh, why, does the car
need a lot of work?

30:46.998 --> 30:50.758
- About us.
- Well...

30:52.998 --> 30:55.198
in that case I'm going
to get some more water.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.278
Did something happen
between you and Carter?

31:01.398 --> 31:03.678
- Oh, don't do it like this.
- Just tell me.

31:04.278 --> 31:06.278
- Is that what you really think?
- Is it so crazy?

31:07.158 --> 31:09.878
You have a close relationship with this man
when we're going through a hard time,

31:09.878 --> 31:12.718
- and when he leaves, you go on a bender.
- Well, nothing happened.

31:12.758 --> 31:15.558
The same way nothing happened
between you and Rebecca.

31:15.678 --> 31:16.798
Why are you bringing that up again?

31:16.798 --> 31:21.678
Again? Sandy, what do you think this is?
What do you think Carter was about?

31:21.838 --> 31:24.118
- I want you to tell me.
- You left me!

31:25.318 --> 31:28.638
- Did you have an affair with him?
- You don't get it, do you?

31:33.798 --> 31:35.078
No.

31:39.575 --> 31:44.255
And then the demonic water polo player throws
his plasma ball at Kichino and the Ironist,

31:44.375 --> 31:48.575
shouting, "Welcome
to Atomic County, bitch."

31:48.575 --> 31:53.215
Then the next panel here,
Kichino catches it, he catches it...

31:53.335 --> 31:56.255
- Thank you, Seth. That was wonderful.
- I wasn't finished.

31:56.255 --> 32:00.975
Yeah, well, you read for an hour and you
described every panel. You're finished, right?

32:02.615 --> 32:04.415
That's right. Seth Cohen.

32:06.495 --> 32:08.295
- That's my water.
- Whatever. I'm thirsty.

32:08.295 --> 32:10.895
Yeah, because you went on
about 45 minutes too long.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.375
Why don't you just get a haircut, okay?

32:12.375 --> 32:14.255
Everyone's a little sick
of the Shaun Cassidy thing.

32:14.255 --> 32:19.095
Guys! As I was saying...
on behalf of Bad Science,

32:19.215 --> 32:21.815
we'd like to thank you all for coming
to the launch of Atomic County.

32:21.855 --> 32:23.535
We have one final surprise.

32:23.615 --> 32:25.575
After getting your copy signed,

32:25.575 --> 32:28.455
you will get a photo with a real-life
member of the Atomic County.

32:28.615 --> 32:31.935
I give you Little Miss Vixen.

32:48.855 --> 32:51.255
- Nice whip.
- Yeah.

32:51.655 --> 32:56.775
- Ah, Mrs. Nichol, you look beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

32:57.255 --> 32:58.415
Is Mr. Nichol with you?

32:58.495 --> 33:02.975
Oh, no. He got held up at the office,
so he asked me to meet him here. Typical.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.975
- Julie Cooper Nichol?
- Yes.

33:05.255 --> 33:08.895
This is for you. Please sign
to show that you received them.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.815
- What is it?
- I wouldn't know, ma'am.

33:30.055 --> 33:31.255
You're divorcing me?

33:31.775 --> 33:32.655
Julie.

33:32.735 --> 33:34.135
You son of a bitch!

33:34.135 --> 33:35.095
Did you have fun

33:35.095 --> 33:38.135
watching me scramble around trying to save
this marriage while you met with lawyers?

33:38.215 --> 33:40.895
- Did you enjoy it?
- Don't be ridiculous.

33:41.215 --> 33:45.135
Okay, fine. You want out. You got it.
But let me tell you something.

33:45.455 --> 33:49.855
I am going to make you pay. Pre-nup or
no pre-nup, I'll bleed you dry.

33:49.935 --> 33:51.615
You won't have a pot...

33:53.855 --> 33:55.735
You'll have to explain these first.

34:01.775 --> 34:03.135
You had me followed?

34:03.495 --> 34:07.535
You have been monitored to one degree
or another since before we were married.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.775
The affair you had
with your former husband,

34:12.215 --> 34:15.135
the tryst last year
with that high schooler Luke.

34:16.295 --> 34:20.335
- Oh, my God.
- I mean, your daughter's boyfriend?

34:20.655 --> 34:21.975
What will people think?

34:24.175 --> 34:25.574
Ex-boyfriend.

34:25.655 --> 34:31.775
Despite all of this, I was willing
to give us a chance... until that.

34:32.014 --> 34:35.054
- But nothing happened! This was...
- Oh, stop it, Julie.

34:35.935 --> 34:40.335
I don't have the stomach for it anymore.
I've gotten a hotel room.

34:40.775 --> 34:43.135
You have a week
to find somewhere else to live.

34:43.735 --> 34:46.415
Then I want you
and your daughter gone.

34:47.135 --> 34:48.735
Now get out of my office.

34:54.054 --> 34:58.255
Oh, by the way, you're fired.

35:00.255 --> 35:01.455
Oh, wow, thank you.

35:03.655 --> 35:05.095
What? Ow!

35:05.935 --> 35:07.455
Cohen, what are you doing?!

35:07.455 --> 35:09.535
Please, Summer,
I need to talk to you, okay?

35:09.535 --> 35:10.615
Can't you see I'm working?

35:10.615 --> 35:13.935
Listen, I'm sorry about what
happened in Miami, okay?

35:13.935 --> 35:16.215
I promise you it'll never happen again.

35:16.415 --> 35:20.535
Okay. That you'll never go on TV and eat whip
cream off a naked girl again? That's reassuring.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.295
Look, Summer, I'm an ass, okay?

35:23.375 --> 35:27.695
I know that. And I know I don't deserve
another shot, but I love you.

35:28.495 --> 35:31.735
And I think you love me, too.
Please?

35:33.495 --> 35:35.935
- I knew it.
- Zach, not now, okay?

35:36.015 --> 35:38.615
- Summer, you were about to say something?
- Summer, don't listen to him.

35:38.615 --> 35:41.695
- I'm not going to tell you again, buddy.
- Or what?

35:42.335 --> 35:45.935
- Or... you'll see.
- Come on, you guys, don't.

35:45.935 --> 35:49.695
I'm sorry...
Guys, guys, stop!

35:52.135 --> 35:55.495
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

36:01.255 --> 36:03.095
You guys, stop it!

36:04.935 --> 36:08.175
- Summer, Summer, I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey.
Are you all right? Is it bleeding?

36:08.895 --> 36:11.375
Everybody, the reading is over.
Thank you for coming.

36:12.135 --> 36:16.135
- Let me explain.
- Explain this! Explain this!

36:33.015 --> 36:36.575
Stop it!
God, what is wrong with you two?!

36:37.255 --> 36:39.295
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

36:39.375 --> 36:44.215
Summer, look, you just got
to choose, okay? Once and for all.

36:44.455 --> 36:46.935
He's right. You have to choose.

36:47.175 --> 36:49.695
Fine. You know what? I choose neither.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.095
- Oh, hey.
- I don't want to hear it!

36:55.295 --> 36:57.535
Just clean it up... now.

36:59.415 --> 37:03.855
Marissa, hey, it's me again.
Listen, uh, call me back, please?

37:03.935 --> 37:05.495
Just tell me what's going on.

37:10.015 --> 37:12.615
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

37:12.695 --> 37:18.095
Uh, yeah. It's just Marissa and I got in a
fight about... um, I don't even know what.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.055
Must be the night for it.
I've been out trying to find Kirsten.

37:21.175 --> 37:23.535
- I thought maybe she might've come home.
- Nah, haven't seen her.

37:24.735 --> 37:26.415
Well, I'm going to go back out.
If she comes back...

37:26.455 --> 37:28.295
Yeah, yeah. Actually, um,
I was going to...

37:28.295 --> 37:30.975
Oh, right, of course. Go see Marissa.

37:31.215 --> 37:33.375
Hey, uh, you sure it's okay that

37:33.495 --> 37:35.215
neither of us are going to go
to Seth's comic book launch.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.135
I'm hoping if I find Kirsten,
I'll get over there before it's over.

37:38.415 --> 37:40.655
- Yeah, good luck.
- Right back at you.

37:55.455 --> 37:56.655
How did you get in here?

37:56.855 --> 37:59.415
The-the back door's open.
Look, I just want to talk.

37:59.415 --> 38:00.495
Get out.

38:00.615 --> 38:04.175
Look, I'm sorry, Marissa.
Okay, I was out of my mind.

38:04.255 --> 38:05.655
And that's an excuse?

38:05.655 --> 38:08.495
I didn't plan it, okay?
It just, it just happened.

38:08.575 --> 38:11.175
- I don't want to hear it.
- Look, I just...

38:12.415 --> 38:14.135
I just want things
to go back like they were.

38:14.255 --> 38:16.215
- Okay, I never meant to hurt you?
- Me?!

38:16.575 --> 38:19.815
Me?! What about Ryan? I mean,
he's your brother! He loves you.

38:19.895 --> 38:22.495
- He would do anything for you.
- Look, I said...!

38:24.855 --> 38:29.015
- I said I'm sorry.
- And so what?

38:31.535 --> 38:33.655
You know, you don't even
deserve him as a brother.

38:37.695 --> 38:40.055
If you don't want to accept
my apology, that's fine.

38:40.575 --> 38:44.015
But I want you to promise me
you will not say anything to him.

38:45.055 --> 38:46.055
Get out.

38:48.455 --> 38:50.215
Get out before I call the police.

38:52.095 --> 38:53.295
You wouldn't.

38:55.215 --> 38:56.655
Try me.

40:36.095 --> 40:39.735
- Hey, where are you?
- I'm sorry.

40:39.815 --> 40:43.055
Oh. Honey, it was my fault.
You were trying to tell me something.

40:43.055 --> 40:46.695
I... I wasn't listening. Just tell me where
you are, and I'll come pick you up.

40:46.815 --> 40:48.295
I'm coming home.

40:50.055 --> 40:54.855
- I thought I was losing you.
- Oh... That's never going to happen.

40:56.615 --> 40:58.935
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

40:59.055 --> 41:01.455
Now, pull over, and I'll come get you.

41:03.215 --> 41:04.535
Kirsten?
