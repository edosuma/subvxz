- Hurry!

01:50.611 --> 01:51.112
Honey LEE

01:51.112 --> 01:53.697
On three.
Smile for the camera

01:55.908 --> 01:57.159
Excuse me.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.453
Lunch is served.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.455
But there's no cheese stick.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.374
Cheese stick?

02:04.375 --> 02:07.294
I'll get that real quick.
Come on, dig in.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.598
Your hotdogs.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.392
Any chance of rain today?

02:21.392 --> 02:22.685
Don't think so.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.488
The worst-ever drought
to hit the nation in fall

02:34.488 --> 02:38.492
is severely affecting crop production

02:38.492 --> 02:41.579
and causing water shortages
in mountainous regions and islands.

02:41.579 --> 02:44.999
The Met Office announced that
dry spells will continue for a period.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.667
Dad!

02:46.792 --> 02:49.295
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah!

02:49.378 --> 02:51.589
You know it's my birthday
not mom's.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.008
She had the most fun.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.678
Was it good?

02:58.387 --> 03:00.890
Reminiscent of the good old days.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.352
Dr. Kim, you were here.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.981
Just got home.
The operation just ended.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.858
Good work, sir.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.068
Where would you want these?

03:13.068 --> 03:15.070
- Over there is fine.
- Okay.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.073
Sorry for asking you to do this.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.201
If it wasn't such
an important operation...

03:20.201 --> 03:23.078
I'm glad that
I could be of help.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.582
They had a real good time.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.376
Especially Mrs. Kim.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.217
Aren't you tired?

03:36.383 --> 03:39.386
Pardon me?
Oh, of course...

03:41.388 --> 03:43.057
I'd better get going then.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.475
Good evening.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.192
How did it go?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.778
You're doing great for someone
who used to teach at university.

03:55.778 --> 03:57.488
Good job, man.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.406
Fuck! The kind of things
they'll have you do!

03:59.406 --> 04:01.992
I'm not their goddamn servant.

04:01.992 --> 04:05.913
Hey, you're the one
that begged me for a job.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.790
I spent my entire working life
doing that.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.792
You gotta be prepared
to do anything.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.671
He is one of our biggest clients.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.882
I don't think I can put up
with this crap any more.

04:16.882 --> 04:20.177
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about your family.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.972
Well, I'm barely hanging on by a thread.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.266
I'm not coming in
to work tomorrow.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.185
What? Hello?

04:28.269 --> 04:31.772
This is not
how you're supposed to live.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.196
Bro!

04:43.784 --> 04:44.785
Long time, man.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.370
What brings you here?

04:46.370 --> 04:50.291
It's Jun-woo's birthday soon
and I was passing by...

04:50.291 --> 04:52.084
Keep going then.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.294
Come on, man.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.461
Jae-hyeok!

04:57.381 --> 04:59.466
The company you work for...

05:02.469 --> 05:03.804
How is it? I mean...

05:04.179 --> 05:05.597
Is that supposed to be a joke?

05:05.597 --> 05:09.184
Of course not.
I just feel responsible.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.894
Do you, really?

05:11.395 --> 05:13.480
So much so it's killing me

05:13.480 --> 05:16.108
Then, don't show up again.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.361
Bra!

05:19.486 --> 05:21.155
And don't call me that.

05:29.371 --> 05:33.292
Have some water, honey.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.504
Is it good? Yeah?

05:39.381 --> 05:40.883
- Dad!
- Hi, dad!

05:40.883 --> 05:44.303
Did you see your brother?
You just missed him.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.389
What are you gobbling up so late?

05:47.389 --> 05:51.769
- Uncle Jae-pil bought it for us!
- It's really good.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.063
Give it a rest, will ya?

05:55.981 --> 05:59.485
Are we going to the theme park
for my birthday?

05:59.485 --> 06:00.986
Can We go?

06:00.986 --> 06:04.365
A theme park? Is that what
you should be thinking about?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.282
Hey, it's his birthday...

06:05.282 --> 06:07.868
Celebrating birthdays is
a luxury we can't afford.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.997
For crying out loud!
Is that all you think about all day?

06:12.081 --> 06:13.582
Damn it.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.211
We're not going then?

06:17.586 --> 06:21.006
Dad's very tired.
Go back to your food.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.384
Want some water, honey?

06:37.981 --> 06:40.901
That's incredibly attractive.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.486
Maybe I over did it.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.410
Did you have a rough day?

06:49.493 --> 06:50.786
No, it was a breeze.

06:50.786 --> 06:54.081
Shall I take the kids
to my mother's for a while?

06:54.206 --> 06:55.082
What?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.459
Or I could get a job somewhere.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.586
Like in a supermarket...

06:59.586 --> 07:01.964
Are you trying to embarrass me?

07:04.174 --> 07:06.385
Of course not, honey.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.764
You've got so much on your plate
and you're constantly irritated.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.600
I...

07:15.686 --> 07:17.271
It's like this.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.398
You're in a 100m race
and half way in,

07:19.398 --> 07:21.191
you're still
in the leading group.

07:21.191 --> 07:25.404
If you continue like that
you can expect a pretty good result.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.283
But then, you trip over
some stupid piece of rock.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.870
It's game over.
You screwed up your race.

07:33.162 --> 07:36.790
But you still gotta get back on your feet
and finish the race anyhow.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.585
Now, wouldn't you be irritated?

07:41.587 --> 07:44.798
Just be grateful
that we are still breathing.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.095
Get some sleep.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.477
For fuck's sake!

07:57.311 --> 07:58.896
You're sure about it this time?

07:58.896 --> 08:00.481
I'm telling you.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.484
I thought Joa Pharmaceutical
was nothing but a hollow shell.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.277
Is that what your brother said?

08:05.861 --> 08:08.864
He wouldn't even give me
the time of day .

08:08.989 --> 08:10.866
And I've got my own intel.

08:10.866 --> 08:14.369
I don't know anything about
the company's performance.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.289
I'm telling you this based on
the recent share market activities.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.667
Someone's been stocking up
on Joa Pharm's shares

08:20.667 --> 08:22.878
over the past few months.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.507
There is definitely something to it.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.884
Can you bet your life on it?

08:28.884 --> 08:31.803
Hey, this isn't simple maths.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.515
You win some, lose some.

08:37.058 --> 08:41.855
Don't you know
what your garbage intel did to my family?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.482
How it screwed up my brother's life?

08:43.482 --> 08:47.986
I never asked you
to drag your brother into it.

08:50.364 --> 08:53.283
All right, man. I'm sorry.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.785
If you screw me again,
I'll shred you to pieces.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.579
I'm certain. I'm positive.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.210
Find out who's been
buying the shares.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.795
Excuse me?

09:04.795 --> 09:07.381
Track them down
See what they look like,

09:07.381 --> 09:11.051
if they're all right and
why they bought them.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.475
I thought you quit.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.769
Give it a rest.
You know I can't.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.481
That's life, man.
You're doing just fine.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.275
- Hey!
- What?

09:26.275 --> 09:28.193
How come we don't develop
any new drugs?

09:28.694 --> 09:29.778
What new drugs?

09:29.778 --> 09:32.573
We're a pharmaceutical company

09:32.573 --> 09:34.575
and not a small one either.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.994
One good drug and...

09:36.994 --> 09:39.705
we won't have to go around
begging people to buy from us.

09:39.705 --> 09:44.585
You know the company's been sold to
a foreign-based firm called BronStar.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.880
The money-grubbing bastards
shut down our R&D department.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.966
And made us sell drugs for kickbacks.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.385
So much for new drug development, eh?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.263
Right.

09:58.473 --> 10:02.269
Getting your hands back
in the share market?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.104
Hell no.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.898
Didn't you get burned enough?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.902
You should think about your family.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.113
I said I wasn't.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.199
Just like gambling,
you gotta hit rock bottom.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.285
Lay off, man!

10:20.162 --> 10:21.663
I'm not getting back into it.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.458
I'm already finished.
I already hit rock bottom.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.672
The bastard
that talked you into it,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.592
he deserves to be skinned alive.

10:38.805 --> 10:39.890
There's nothing you can do?

10:39.890 --> 10:41.892
I have no money.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.102
Come on, don't do this.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.812
What about your wedding fund?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.981
It's long gone.

10:48.982 --> 10:49.983
Right...

10:51.151 --> 10:53.654
Just when the perfect
opportunity arises.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.491
Can you take out a loan?

10:58.367 --> 11:02.079
You screwed up your brother's life.
Trying to do the same for me, too?

11:02.162 --> 11:05.165
You make it sound like
I'm some kind of a disease.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.001
Why are you doing this then?

11:09.586 --> 11:12.881
I told you.
I have to make it up to my brother.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.591
He deserves better.

11:14.591 --> 11:18.095
He has a doctorate.
Shouldn't be a drug salesman.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.180
I owe it to my sister-in-law,
my nephew and niece.

11:22.391 --> 11:26.186
I know how you feel, honey.
but is stock trading the only solution?

11:26.186 --> 11:26.978
Yes.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.855
You can lose everything.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.483
For my brother's family,
I'll take that risk.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.567
Any day!

11:36.071 --> 11:38.198
Are you gonna leave him
like that?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.701
His salary's been garnished
since forever.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.078
And he's still going around
trying to borrow money for stocks.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.872
I'm worried
he'll resort to loansharks.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.874
Leave him before it's too late.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.876
You deserve better.

11:49.876 --> 11:54.005
Jae-hyeok, you're the one
that hooked me up with him.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.680
I didn't know
he'd turn out like this.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.768
C2H5OH, ethanol.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.771
Used as antiseptic
and to make liquor.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.481
I thought
he was a useful kind.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.691
But?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.491
CH3OH, Methanol.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.786
Makes you go blind or
could kill you if you drink it.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.707
It's poison.
That's what he is.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.878
Cut him some slack.
He's your brother.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.463
Not to me, not any more.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.256
Oh, come on.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.467
Even if he were
the most depraved criminal...

12:38.467 --> 12:40.969
- Yeon-ju.
- Yes?

12:40.969 --> 12:47.601
I'm sorry but I can't help you
with your problems now.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.395
Things are that bad?

12:50.896 --> 12:52.397
Let's just drink.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.181
You're eating in secret now?

13:26.181 --> 13:29.309
The kids couldn't sleep
because they were hungry.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.310
Why did you get up?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.979
Come and have a bite.
It's really good.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.606
I'm lost for words.

13:34.606 --> 13:39.653
Are you going into hibernation?
What have you got in your stomachs?

13:41.071 --> 13:42.364
Come on, eat up.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.079
You're slacking off.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.665
Can't we take it easy
on a day like this?

13:51.665 --> 13:54.292
Absolutely not.
What did the doctor say?

13:54.292 --> 13:57.295
Someone who drinks everyday like you
must exercise everyday

13:57.295 --> 13:58.588
Unless you want an early grave.

13:58.588 --> 14:02.801
They'll say anything to sell drugs.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.804
Do you want to make me
a widow?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.181
Whatever.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.268
Where are you going?

14:11.268 --> 14:13.186
I gotta take a leak.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.855
Do I need a permission for that, too?

14:25.490 --> 14:26.366
What the...?

14:27.701 --> 14:29.369
Give me your racket.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.705
- What for?
- Just give it to me.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.507
What have you got there?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.968
I don't know.
Just wait.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.683
Oh my God! Baby!

15:07.073 --> 15:11.494
Well, that's your problem.
Find out no matter what.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.706
If we screw up the timing because of you,
you're dead meat.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.459
I'd hurry if I were you.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.087
Full of excuses.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.591
Wait.
One moment.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.393
Are you going to be here all night?
Get a move on.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.979
Hey, you all right, man?

15:40.690 --> 15:41.691
What is it?

15:41.691 --> 15:44.402
Drowning?
It doesn't look very deep.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.488
- I don't think it was drowning.
- What is it, then? Illegal disposal?

15:47.489 --> 15:50.450
Doesn't look like it either.
Take a look yourself.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.580
What is it, then?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.791
Jae-pil.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.168
Brace yourself.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.672
What's the hell?

16:06.091 --> 16:07.300
Here.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.596
Holy shit!

16:12.389 --> 16:15.475
This is a family photo taken 2 days ago.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.395
Last night, she put her kids
to bed as always

16:18.395 --> 16:20.981
and went to bed
with her husband.

16:21.106 --> 16:25.151
And she was gone
when the husband woke up this morning.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.988
She was discovered like this
just overnight.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.283
The body was in a state of cachexia
meaning it was reduced...

16:32.283 --> 16:34.285
- to skin and bones.
- Yes.

16:34.285 --> 16:38.665
It can't have happened overnight.
It doesn't make any sense.

16:38.665 --> 16:43.294
Are you ruling out alien abduction?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.380
I saw a movie about that.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.673
What the hell?

16:46.673 --> 16:50.385
Please ignore him.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.303
This is hardly the place or the time.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.888
Apparently not.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.515
Please continue.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.562
What's even weirder is that
we have more bodies like this.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.188
How do you mean?

17:02.188 --> 17:05.483
Two more corpses
came in this morning.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.694
Each from Jamsil and Bundang.

17:09.863 --> 17:10.780
Serial murders?

17:10.780 --> 17:17.494
And a week ago, we had the bodies of
a family from Gangwon Province.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.204
Their condition was
strikingly similar to this corpse.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.205
On a national scale?

17:20.205 --> 17:22.876
It's a case for Feds then.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.377
- I'm going.
- Hey!

17:24.377 --> 17:27.797
- Don't tell the Captain.
- You can't just leave.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.090
Sorry about that.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.267
Come on! Over here!

17:39.893 --> 17:40.894
What is it?

17:41.978 --> 17:43.897
- Look over there!
- Where?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.690
There! You see?

17:47.192 --> 17:49.069
- Call for a backup.
- Yes, sir!

17:49.069 --> 17:51.905
I found them
drifting down the stream.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.411
Wake up, honey.
Wake up.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.705
What's the matter?

18:00.705 --> 18:02.499
Come and watch the news.
Hurry!

18:03.208 --> 18:04.959
What is it?

18:04.959 --> 18:08.254
So far, 58 bodies have been discovered.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.174
And reports of more bodies
are coming in as we speak.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.593
- Are we... at war?
- I don't think so.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.095
What's going on?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.764
Call Jae-pil.
He must know something.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.183
He is a lowest rank cop.
What would he know?

18:20.266 --> 18:21.684
Can you get my golf gear?

18:23.394 --> 18:26.106
You're going golfing when people
are mysteriously dropping dead?

18:26.106 --> 18:29.692
Am I supposed to watch
the news in horror?

18:29.692 --> 18:31.778
Who's going to bring bread
to the table?

18:34.906 --> 18:36.866
How about a 'good morning'
to your dad?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.371
Which course?

18:42.080 --> 18:45.083
No promising news,
only rumors of audit...

18:45.083 --> 18:47.377
Is this another flop?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.587
Jae-pil,
you're off to Gangwon-do.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.381
What for?

18:51.381 --> 18:56.469
The woman whose body we pulled
from Bundang yesterday,

18:56.469 --> 18:59.180
her husband and kids were
found dead this morning.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.306
But they were fine.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.308
They were, until yesterday.

19:02.308 --> 19:08.690
We found some pictures
from a family outing to Gangwon-do.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.399
So what?

19:09.399 --> 19:11.568
It's the same mountain stream
where another family was found dead.

19:12.360 --> 19:18.158
The Captain is certain that you'll find
toxic substances in the water.

19:18.366 --> 19:22.495
So, look for any potential
contaminators in the area.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.999
And get a tox screen.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.168
Go over it with a fine comb, okay?

19:28.501 --> 19:29.502
Hey!

19:30.378 --> 19:33.006
Why should I do this?
Send Detective Park instead.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.090
He's got things to do here.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.009
Yes, Doctor.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.804
I'm on my way now.
I'll be right over.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.267
We're not goddamn CSI.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.687
- Move your ass, now!
- I am going!

19:50.190 --> 19:52.775
Does he care about being a cop?

19:52.775 --> 19:55.570
He has a loan to pay off.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.784
Hello?

20:01.784 --> 20:03.077
Hey, how are you?

20:03.077 --> 20:05.205
Hui-jeong died.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.081
What?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.002
- Good shot!
- A great shot, indeed.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.088
What's gotten into you?

20:14.088 --> 20:17.175
I swore to avenge myself, didn't I?
Be prepared.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.260
- Did you bring enough?
- Of course, sir.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.888
Enough to cover all 18 holes.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.681
Please.
Let me take that.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.976
Did you see the news
this morning?

20:26.976 --> 20:27.685
What news?

20:27.685 --> 20:29.562
- So many died.
- What happened?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.773
Some kind of epidemic, I think.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.274
- Lim.
- Yes, sir.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.068
Can we focus on the game?

20:35.068 --> 20:39.572
Do we have to discuss
public health issues out here?

20:39.572 --> 20:42.075
Of course not.
This way, please.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.791
Are you feeling okay?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.876
You don't look so well.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.170
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm fine.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.172
You've been drinking water
all morning.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.966
I'm parched for some reason.

20:57.966 --> 21:01.678
Maybe you're dehydrated.
Please take some of this.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.599
I'm not dehydrated.
I've been like this for a few days.

21:06.891 --> 21:10.186
- I'm fine. Let's go.
- Moving on.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.481
It's perfect weather!

21:13.481 --> 21:15.692
You got the best day!

21:24.784 --> 21:27.578
This one is a 100-yard,
Which club, sir?

21:34.377 --> 21:36.296
Which club would you like?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.308
Aren't you playing this one?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.186
Dr. Kim!

21:54.480 --> 21:55.898
Doctor!

21:55.898 --> 21:57.275
What's wrong with him?

22:06.659 --> 22:09.579
Help me... Please...

22:09.871 --> 22:10.872
Dr. Kim?

22:11.497 --> 22:12.498
Dr. Kim!

22:14.792 --> 22:15.793
Dr. Kim!

22:19.505 --> 22:21.007
What happened?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.175
What's he doing?

22:29.891 --> 22:33.686
The water source starts up there,
runs through here.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.981
Then flows all the way
to join the Han River.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.776
The water is so clean and cold,

22:39.776 --> 22:43.071
it attracts a lot of tourists
in summer.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.699
This village survives of tourism.

22:46.783 --> 22:50.787
And you're saying there is
something wrong with the water?

22:50.787 --> 22:55.208
Is there a chemical factory
or a waste plant nearby?

22:55.208 --> 22:57.710
This place is off limits
to any industrial infrastructure!

22:58.503 --> 23:02.507
I'm sorry for poking around.

23:03.674 --> 23:07.970
So clean and refreshing...
Such a pity a family died here.

23:08.763 --> 23:11.265
Oh them...

23:11.265 --> 23:15.561
It was ruled family suicide
due to financial hardships.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.771
- Suicide?
- That's right.

23:16.771 --> 23:20.900
Autopsy revealed that they suffered
from severe malnutrition.

23:20.900 --> 23:26.572
And we had witnesses testify that
they were in terrible financial shape.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.573
Is that so?

23:29.909 --> 23:32.787
The way people
make light of their lives!

23:32.787 --> 23:36.290
Exactly my thoughts.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.596
What are you doing?

23:51.597 --> 23:53.766
Why are you drinking water
like that?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.393
Supper not going down well.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.603
You can't stand us
drinking water now?

23:58.896 --> 24:01.399
Aunt Hui-jeong died.

24:01.607 --> 24:05.194
Weon-jun and Gyeong-jun, too.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.662
Why are you still there?

24:14.662 --> 24:16.664
I gotta stick around
until we get the tox screen back.

24:16.664 --> 24:17.665
Doing what?

24:17.665 --> 24:21.169
Poke around some more, I guess.
He's driving me up the wall.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.171
- Where are you staying?
- Where am I staying?

24:23.171 --> 24:25.381
I'm sleeping in my car
like a dog.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.299
How come?

24:26.299 --> 24:28.092
No-one in the village
will offer me a room,

24:28.092 --> 24:29.886
I'm not welcome here.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.180
Such a weird neighborhood.

24:33.306 --> 24:36.601
Did you look into the loan
that I asked you about?

24:36.601 --> 24:39.896
I had no time. We're on full alert
because of the mass deaths.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.314
Full alert?

24:41.397 --> 24:43.774
It's our future
that's on full alert!

24:44.066 --> 24:46.652
- I gotta go.
- Give me a break.

24:49.489 --> 24:54.285
If she can't trust me,
who in the world will?

24:54.494 --> 24:56.496
So much for a trusting relationship.

25:36.994 --> 25:41.290
Can't believe I'm doing this
over a suicide case.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.293
At least the air is fresh.

25:48.881 --> 25:54.178
What the fuck is happening?

26:00.268 --> 26:01.561
Where is my cellphone?

26:06.190 --> 26:10.194
Jecheon, 11-12-2011 07:25am
Body count: 15

26:11.696 --> 26:13.489
Gochang, 11-12-2011 07:12am
Body count: 11

26:13.489 --> 26:15.575
Mungyeong, 11-12-2011 06:05am
Body count: 3

26:15.575 --> 26:18.786
Chungju, 11-12-2011 08:22am
Body count: 5

26:21.497 --> 26:24.250
Jeonju, 11-12-2011 09:05am
Body count: 23

26:24.458 --> 26:27.169
Gwangju, 11-12-2011 08:43am
Body count: 15

26:27.461 --> 26:30.256
Incheon, 11-12-2011 10:07am
Body count: 17

26:30.590 --> 26:32.383
Gangleung, 11-12-2011 09:30am
Body count: 8

26:32.466 --> 26:35.177
Busan, 11-12-2011 08:15am
Body count: 14

26:42.602 --> 26:46.480
Based on the analysis of
information collected thus far,

26:46.480 --> 26:48.107
we believe this is
a matter to be handled

26:48.107 --> 26:51.110
by the Ministry of Health
and Welfare.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.778
Are you suggesting
it's a fully fledged epidemic?

26:52.778 --> 26:54.196
We cannot be sure
at this moment,

26:54.196 --> 26:57.074
but there is no other explanation.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.660
Like the A1H1 virus
or a super bacteria?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.954
It could be something far more
dangerous than that.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.081
Set up a crisis control task force.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.875
Your priority is determining
the cause of death.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.668
Until the exact cause of death
is confirmed,

27:07.668 --> 27:10.880
no hypotheses or theories
should be discussed with the press .

27:11.088 --> 27:14.091
Pay special attention to rumors

27:14.091 --> 27:16.594
spreading through
the internet and SNS.

27:16.594 --> 27:20.306
The families and friends'
testimonies revealed that

27:20.306 --> 27:22.683
the deceased showed
an abnormal increase in appetite

27:22.683 --> 27:25.686
without gaining much weight.

27:25.686 --> 27:29.190
They all showed a sudden drop in appetite
followed by an excessive thirst,

27:29.190 --> 27:30.650
2-3 days leading
up to the death.

27:30.650 --> 27:33.152
We weren't able to find
any diseases

27:33.152 --> 27:34.779
with these exact symptoms
in the database.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.073
It could be a new disease
that is yet to be reported.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.491
It's our job to determine that.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.284
Do we have the epidemiological
analysis of the victims?

27:40.284 --> 27:42.078
We'll get the results in a week.

27:42.078 --> 27:43.788
That's unacceptable.
Make it quicker.

27:43.788 --> 27:46.666
But there is a physical time
required for the tests.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.292
Time is a luxury we don't have.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.378
I'll put a rush on it.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.595
Put up a barrier over there!

28:05.351 --> 28:07.561
- Hey.
- We got the tox screen result.

28:07.561 --> 28:08.062
And?

28:08.062 --> 28:10.981
No harmful substances were found.
It's a grade-A clean water.

28:10.981 --> 28:11.982
Nothing at all?

28:11.982 --> 28:14.985
Just some planktons,
waterborne organisms and larvae.

28:14.985 --> 28:20.991
The Captain is going on about
North Korea's biochemical weapons.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.494
That's just ridiculous.

28:23.494 --> 28:26.205
You should wrap up
and come back to Seoul.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.290
We are in complete chaos here.

28:30.584 --> 28:34.004
Why are they throwing
themselves in the water?

28:44.390 --> 28:45.558
What the heck?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.777
Mom... Mom...

28:57.486 --> 29:00.072
In the bath tub... Please...

29:15.171 --> 29:16.172
What the hell is that?

29:17.256 --> 29:20.259
Come and take a look.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.094
- What the heck?
- What are they?

29:32.396 --> 29:33.898
These are horsehair worms.

29:34.899 --> 29:38.694
Aren't they parasites that
use insects as their host?

29:38.694 --> 29:41.489
Only this time,
they chose humans .

29:41.489 --> 29:44.784
But their ecology and behavior is identical
to that of a regular horsehair worm.

29:44.784 --> 29:45.951
Are you suggesting...?

29:46.869 --> 29:49.288
That's right.
These are mutant variants.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.166
Can someone explain to us
in layman terms?

29:55.961 --> 29:58.589
Also known as
'Gordius nudatus,'

29:59.089 --> 30:04.386
they still remain mysterious creatures.

30:06.472 --> 30:10.100
They take carnivorous insects such as
grass hoppers as their host.

30:10.184 --> 30:12.812
And live inside their bodies.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.688
When the larva reaches
breeding period,

30:14.688 --> 30:19.068
it stimulates the host's central
nerve system making it jump into water.

30:19.068 --> 30:24.573
The parasite then leaves its host
to reproduce in water.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.576
It can manipulate
the host's brain?

30:28.285 --> 30:29.870
How is that possible?

30:29.870 --> 30:33.290
The precise mechanism underlying
the phenomenon is not yet understood.

30:33.290 --> 30:37.378
Their method of survival
is a mystery.

30:37.878 --> 30:43.092
Have there been any cases where
they used humans as host?

30:43.092 --> 30:44.677
None so far.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.096
Hence the term,
mutant variants.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.014
How did that happen?

30:49.014 --> 30:51.767
We don't know at this point.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.061
How did it enter the victim's body?

30:54.061 --> 30:58.858
The victims must have come in contact
with water containing the larvae.

30:59.483 --> 31:03.487
The larvae must have entered
the victim's body

31:03.487 --> 31:06.699
through the anus or mouth.

31:09.493 --> 31:14.498
And attached themselves to their organs
until they are fully mature insects.

31:14.874 --> 31:20.379
The host human unknowingly
supplies them with nutrients.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.214
When the insects reached
breeding period,

31:22.214 --> 31:25.259
the host feels an excessive thirst

31:25.259 --> 31:29.263
until eventually, throwing
themselves into water.

31:29.263 --> 31:32.266
That's when these worms
leave the body.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.896
When the organisms that lived inside
as part of the organs left all at once,

31:36.896 --> 31:41.483
the host went into shock and died,
showing signs of cachexia.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.904
That's why the corpses looked as if
they've suffered from malnutrition.

31:44.904 --> 31:48.490
You'll find the larvae in the water
where the bodies were found.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.909
Larvae?

31:50.075 --> 31:52.077
Horsehair worms are
such prolific reproducers.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.580
They lay hundreds of thousands
of eggs at a time.

31:54.914 --> 31:58.167
If they are responsible
for these deaths

31:58.375 --> 32:02.254
the crisis that we're faced with
is a lot more serious than you think.

32:02.379 --> 32:06.175
Do you know how many people
visited streams or rivers this summer?

32:06.175 --> 32:07.968
Dr. Hwang was right.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.762
It's horsehair worm.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.768
An announcement was just made
at the Crisis Control Center.

32:15.768 --> 32:19.104
Please listen to
its disturbing revelations.

32:19.897 --> 32:23.192
We have identified that the unexplained
mass deaths in recent months

32:23.192 --> 32:25.903
have been caused by
mutant horsehair worms.

32:26.195 --> 32:30.366
If you have been experiencing
a sudden increase in appetite,

32:30.449 --> 32:34.787
or have suffered from a severe thirst
over the past few days,

32:35.287 --> 32:37.873
or even if you don't have
any of these symptoms,

32:37.873 --> 32:40.167
if you've been in contact
with freshwater

32:40.167 --> 32:42.169
in ponds, lakes, rivers or streams,

32:42.169 --> 32:45.798
please visit your nearest hospital
for an immediate checkup.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.592
- Mom, I want more water.
- All right, honey.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.393
- What's wrong with you?
- Answer me!

32:57.393 --> 32:59.478
Did you take the kids
to a river in the summer?

32:59.478 --> 33:02.189
You were busy at work
so, I took the kids to...

33:02.189 --> 33:04.149
Did you go with
that friend of yours.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.484
Whose family died recently?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.485
Yes.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.363
Get them dressed.

33:09.363 --> 33:10.155
What for?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.657
We gotta take them to the hospital.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.267
Where would you like to scan?

33:39.351 --> 33:40.978
From head to toe.

33:40.978 --> 33:43.272
- Of the man.
- Yes, sir.

33:47.985 --> 33:50.696
Why do we need to
go to hospital?

33:50.696 --> 33:53.282
Because you might be
infected with parasites.

33:53.282 --> 33:55.284
We gotta make sure
that you're okay.

33:55.284 --> 33:56.785
But we're fine.

33:56.869 --> 33:58.203
Didn't you see the news?

33:58.370 --> 34:01.081
The dead people had
the exact same symptoms as you.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.208
You've been drinking water
like fish.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.002
They all did before they died!

34:06.003 --> 34:07.796
Where did you put my socks?

34:08.088 --> 34:10.674
Come on, get dressed.
We're going to the hospital.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.260
Come on, Jun-woo.
Get dressed.

34:14.887 --> 34:20.266
As you see their numbers vary
from one to as many as five.

34:20.684 --> 34:25.397
But they're all found
in the small intestine.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.065
Their sizes vary, too

34:27.065 --> 34:30.194
but the largest one
was as long as the intestine.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.905
They are much more intelligent
than you'd expect.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.199
They stick to the inner walls
of the organ

34:35.199 --> 34:39.411
pretending to be a part of it
and draw nutrients from the host.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.580
They position themselves
in the small intestine

34:41.580 --> 34:43.290
where most absorption occurs.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.460
Can't we just remove them?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.879
Extraction is impossible.

34:48.879 --> 34:52.591
It fuses itself completely
with the inner walls of the intestine

34:52.591 --> 34:53.675
much like a leech.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.469
Not only is it
technically challenging,

34:55.469 --> 34:59.890
but it could lead
to massive hemorrhaging.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.893
How can we
get rid of them then?

35:02.893 --> 35:05.187
Physical extraction is impossible.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.773
The only way would be
by drug-induced necrosis.

35:08.107 --> 35:11.693
By drug, you mean...
vermicide?

35:11.693 --> 35:14.988
They're a kind of parasite.
Vermicide could remedy the problem.

35:14.988 --> 35:18.659
Let's put together a patient group
and conduct a clinical trial.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.285
What if something goes wrong?

35:20.369 --> 35:21.954
What could go wrong?

35:22.579 --> 35:26.583
It's common sense to prescribe
vermicide for a parasitic problem!

35:27.876 --> 35:29.795
We don't know what kind of
side effects it could induce.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.380
We'll find out, won't we?

35:31.380 --> 35:33.465
Unless we try, we won't know
if it works or not.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.092
These people are not lab animals!

35:35.092 --> 35:36.802
If we do nothing,
they'll die any way.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.595
How can you say such a thing?

35:38.595 --> 35:39.805
Hey!

35:39.972 --> 35:42.683
We gotta find the cure
or they'll all die.

35:43.892 --> 35:44.977
This way, please.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.688
It's not your place.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.775
Dr. Kim, to the ER!

35:51.859 --> 35:54.570
Dr. Kim, to the ER!

35:54.570 --> 35:56.572
- Contact Dr. Kim immediately.
- Yes, sir!

35:59.992 --> 36:01.076
What happened?

36:01.076 --> 36:04.079
She was complaining of stomach pain
but no anodyne is working.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.290
What are you doing?
Hold her down.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.375
- Let's do this.
- Yes, sir.

36:08.584 --> 36:09.793
What happened?

36:09.793 --> 36:13.589
My daughter had the same symptoms
described on the news.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.674
So, I gave her some vermicides

36:15.674 --> 36:18.886
because they said it was a parasite.

36:18.886 --> 36:24.766
Within 5 minutes, she started
rolling on the floor screaming.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.685
Help her, please!

36:27.978 --> 36:29.188
Ju-hui! My baby!

36:30.981 --> 36:32.065
Another shot!

36:32.065 --> 36:34.359
Her blood pressure's dropping.

36:38.071 --> 36:38.989
No! No!

36:38.989 --> 36:43.285
We're raising the contagion warning
to the highest level.

36:43.285 --> 36:45.204
Anyone with suspicious symptoms

36:45.204 --> 36:47.497
must immediately contact
the nearest hospital

36:47.706 --> 36:50.500
to be tested for horsehair
worm infection.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.795
Follow the instructions provided by
the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

36:53.795 --> 37:00.677
We strongly advise you
to refrain from taking vermicides.

37:00.969 --> 37:06.975
and do not, under any circumstances,
go near the waterside.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.894
We ask citizens to have patience

37:08.894 --> 37:11.897
and wait until
a cure has been developed.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.776
Going near water is suicidal.

37:17.069 --> 37:20.781
As of this moment, access to any

37:20.989 --> 37:25.994
watercourses, reservoirs, cisterns
or puddles containing a body of water

37:26.078 --> 37:28.789
is strictly prohibited
until further notice.

37:31.458 --> 37:35.379
We must quarantine
all suspected cases.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.589
This is not a contagious disease
we're dealing with.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.966
It's to protect the those infected.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.759
We must prepare
for all eventualities.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.261
We stick to protocol.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.263
Even if it means putting
these lives in danger?

37:44.263 --> 37:45.180
Hey!

37:45.973 --> 37:49.101
I've been handling situations like this
since you were in diapers!

37:49.101 --> 37:51.395
I'll come up
with the countermeasures!

37:51.478 --> 37:53.689
Why don't you do your job
and get a grip on the situation?

37:53.689 --> 37:55.899
Quarantine, my ass.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.111
I'll take no more of your crap.

38:11.290 --> 38:14.293
Doctor, this is Lim.
Things must be crazy for you.

38:14.459 --> 38:18.463
It's my family.
They've been showing the symptoms.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.299
But it's absolute chaos.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.468
Sorry?
Contact the administration?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.178
Hello?

38:26.305 --> 38:28.807
Son of a bitch!
After all that I did for him!

38:29.308 --> 38:31.310
What are you doing?
We gotta go!

38:31.310 --> 38:33.979
All right.
Let me just tidy up quickly.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.106
There is no time for that.
Come on.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.984
You'll have to fix meals for yourself
while we're gone.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.987
Stop worrying about me and
think about your-goddamn-selves!

38:42.362 --> 38:44.865
Okay... I'm almost done.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.576
It's not like they'll give us
a cure right away.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.077
They haven't found one yet.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.788
They'll find one soon.
They have all the experts working on that.

38:51.788 --> 38:55.167
- Dad, my throat's burning up.
- Me, too.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.294
It's okay. Just drink some water.
You'll be fine.

38:58.503 --> 39:02.007
Yeon-ju, it's me.
I think my family is infected.

39:02.883 --> 39:04.885
They have the same symptoms.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.304
I'm contacting
all hospitals in the area.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.806
Can you hook us up with one?

39:10.349 --> 39:13.060
I see.

39:18.482 --> 39:19.983
Okay, hang on!

39:21.985 --> 39:23.862
Give us some water, please.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.072
Okay, just a minute.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.877
What are you doing here?

39:42.089 --> 39:43.298
Chief?

39:43.965 --> 39:47.386
It's all my fault.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.680
What are you talking about?

39:51.264 --> 39:55.769
I turned a blind eye to it.

39:56.561 --> 40:00.065
Pretended I didn't see anything.

40:00.065 --> 40:03.193
Slow down.
What did you see?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.487
I saw them.

40:07.197 --> 40:09.408
Saw the bastards...

40:12.577 --> 40:13.703
Hang on a second.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.289
Hey.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.374
Where are you?

40:17.457 --> 40:18.875
Still in Gangwon-do.
Why?

40:19.084 --> 40:21.670
Your sister-in-law, nephew
and niece are infected.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.968
Pick up the damn phone!

40:45.110 --> 40:46.403
Have you lost your minds?

40:46.403 --> 40:47.487
Water!

40:53.785 --> 40:56.788
Water... water...

41:10.093 --> 41:12.179
No! No!

41:20.103 --> 41:22.189
Gyeong-sun,
what's wrong with you?

41:22.189 --> 41:24.357
- Get a hold of yourself
- Water!

41:25.859 --> 41:27.652
No, Jun-woo!
Come to daddy!

41:28.570 --> 41:31.072
Please! Come to your senses!

41:35.577 --> 41:38.079
Ye-ji!
No, baby!

41:40.582 --> 41:42.876
- Water... water...
- Ye-ji, come here!

41:44.878 --> 41:46.880
No, darling!

41:47.172 --> 41:49.883
You can't go outside!
Come back in here!

41:50.383 --> 41:51.384
No! No!

41:52.302 --> 41:54.679
Ye-ji, it's dangerous, honey

41:54.679 --> 41:56.097
Come to daddy.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.359
Stop!

42:09.694 --> 42:12.072
Please wake up!

43:18.263 --> 43:20.682
Mommy...

43:47.375 --> 43:50.170
No pictures!
No pictures, please!

43:50.795 --> 43:52.380
No pictures!

43:52.380 --> 43:54.466
Please!

43:54.466 --> 43:56.593
Bo-eun!

43:56.968 --> 43:58.678
Bo-eun...

44:13.985 --> 44:19.366
Let me go!
Honey... Honey!

44:19.491 --> 44:21.159
Let me go!

44:22.160 --> 44:23.370
Honey!

44:23.370 --> 44:25.080
Fellow Koreans,

44:25.288 --> 44:29.793
I stand before you
with bitter grief in my heart

44:30.085 --> 44:32.379
and hereby declare
a national health emergency.

44:32.379 --> 44:34.589
The recent epidemic
of mutant horsehair worm

44:34.798 --> 44:39.010
has brought upon us the most
shocking and fatal damage

44:39.094 --> 44:43.098
than any other crises or disasters
we have faced.

44:43.306 --> 44:47.268
The number of deaths
has surpassed 3,000

44:47.352 --> 44:54.484
and we have 100,000 confirmed
cases of infection nationwide

44:54.484 --> 45:01.199
The number of the those infected
is estimated to be more than a million.

45:01.366 --> 45:05.078
Your government hereby
invokes emergency rule.

45:05.203 --> 45:12.502
This is an unavoidable measure to protect
the lives and safety of our people.

45:12.585 --> 45:17.382
I implore that you give us your full support
in our effort to fight this crisis.

45:17.757 --> 45:21.261
Fellow Koreans, have faith in us
and give us time.

45:21.261 --> 45:23.388
We promise to throw
everything we have

45:23.555 --> 45:28.059
into bringing you safely
through this time of need.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.396
I should have told this earlier.

45:31.563 --> 45:35.567
It was this spring
right before the summer started.

45:37.277 --> 45:43.575
I couldn't sleep
so, I came out for a dip.

45:44.075 --> 45:47.287
That's when I saw
some strangers.

45:49.414 --> 45:53.960
They released dogs
in the stream.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.890
I thought they were
some wretched bastards

46:06.890 --> 46:09.476
trying to get rid of
their sick dogs.

46:10.268 --> 46:14.481
Because the dogs were
in such terrible shape.

46:15.398 --> 46:16.900
Didn't you report it
to the authorities?

46:17.108 --> 46:21.112
We were only days away
from tourist season.

46:21.404 --> 46:23.573
Couldn't risk jeopardizing
a year's income.

46:23.573 --> 46:28.286
I collected the dogs' corpses and
buried them in the mountain.

46:29.788 --> 46:34.959
Then came the holiday season
and the tourists flocked by.

46:35.585 --> 46:38.171
And nothing happened.

46:38.880 --> 46:43.468
Then, a few months after summer,

46:43.468 --> 46:47.096
Kim's family were found
drowned in the stream.

46:48.097 --> 46:52.894
Something horrendous was happening

46:53.895 --> 46:58.483
but I was worried about ruining
the village's reputation...

47:07.075 --> 47:08.076
Hey.

47:08.076 --> 47:08.993
I tracked them down.

47:08.993 --> 47:09.869
Who?

47:09.869 --> 47:12.497
You asked me to track down
those that bought Joa Pharm's shares.

47:13.665 --> 47:14.999
I told you!

47:17.001 --> 47:18.378
What the hell are you doing here?

47:18.586 --> 47:21.506
If they have the symptoms,
redirect them straight to quarantine.

47:21.673 --> 47:24.008
There is no need
for a written diagnosis

47:24.300 --> 47:27.011
Consult the damn protocol
for running quarantine.

47:28.513 --> 47:30.181
What did you put
in the public announcement?

47:30.849 --> 47:32.851
What's the matter
with you people?

47:33.476 --> 47:34.978
How is the remedy
coming along?

47:35.061 --> 47:37.772
Still working on it, sir.

47:37.772 --> 47:38.773
Until when?

47:39.065 --> 47:40.859
After they've all drowned
themselves?

47:41.776 --> 47:43.570
Don't slack off
because it's not contagious

47:43.987 --> 47:46.364
The number of confirmed cases
has reached a million!

47:46.364 --> 47:48.283
Get your acts together!

47:51.286 --> 47:52.370
Chief!

48:03.673 --> 48:05.258
Sorry but can we have
another one?

48:07.385 --> 48:09.470
Drink up.
Good girl.

48:09.470 --> 48:11.389
I'm sorry, honey.

48:11.389 --> 48:12.056
What about?

48:12.056 --> 48:15.476
This wouldn't have happened
if I'd just stayed home last summer.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.478
I shouldn't have taken
the kids there.

48:17.478 --> 48:19.188
Don't say that.
You did nothing wrong.

48:19.188 --> 48:21.190
It's my fault
for not looking out for you.

48:24.068 --> 48:26.571
Dad, are we going to die?

48:26.571 --> 48:29.073
Don't be silly, big guy!

48:29.991 --> 48:32.201
You'll get better as soon as
you take your medicine.

48:32.201 --> 48:34.078
Why aren't they
giving it to us?

48:34.078 --> 48:36.497
They will.
It's right on its way .

48:36.497 --> 48:39.375
You work for a company
that makes medicines.

48:39.375 --> 48:41.461
Can you tell them to hurry?

48:41.878 --> 48:46.674
I'll tell them for sure.

48:46.674 --> 48:49.469
Can you keep a promise?

48:49.886 --> 48:52.180
That you'll be strong
until you get your medicine.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.474
Then, I'll take you out
to a theme park.

48:54.474 --> 48:55.391
Really?

48:55.391 --> 48:58.603
Of course! We'll go on
every single ride there,

48:58.603 --> 49:01.397
watch the firework and parade

49:01.397 --> 49:03.399
and eat candies.
What do you say?

49:03.399 --> 49:04.692
I like it!

49:04.692 --> 49:08.404
What about you, Ye-ji?
You both promised.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.156
To stay strong until you take
your medicine and get better.

49:10.156 --> 49:13.076
Okay?

49:19.582 --> 49:23.169
Since I was going to die
anyway,

49:24.170 --> 49:27.298
I took some vermicide
I had at home

49:27.882 --> 49:30.301
and the thirst went away
like magic.

49:30.468 --> 49:31.886
What was that medicine?

49:31.886 --> 49:35.890
What makes you think
I'm talking bullshit?

49:35.890 --> 49:37.392
- No, I'm not kidding...
- Hey, give me my medicine.

49:37.684 --> 49:38.977
- Hey!
- What?

49:38.977 --> 49:40.603
Give me my medicine.

49:43.856 --> 49:44.857
Here.

49:45.984 --> 49:46.985
This is the one.

49:48.361 --> 49:49.487
'Windazole?'

49:50.071 --> 49:51.155
How are the rest
of his symptoms?

49:51.864 --> 49:55.284
He's showing a sign
of slight malnutrition.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.578
But the horsehair worm
has become necrotic.

49:58.162 --> 50:01.082
There was a working
vermicide after all!

50:04.002 --> 50:06.796
Minister,
we have good news.

50:06.796 --> 50:08.381
We found the cure!

50:08.381 --> 50:10.383
The company you work for.

50:10.383 --> 50:12.093
It's a vermicide manufactured
by your company.

50:12.093 --> 50:14.303
It kills off the horsehair worm!

50:14.303 --> 50:19.183
Crisis Control Center has identified
a cure for horsehair worm parasite.

50:19.976 --> 50:25.565
A clinical test has confirmed necrosis
of the mutant horsehair worm.

50:25.565 --> 50:27.859
Crisis Control Center will

50:27.859 --> 50:31.195
with immediate and close assistance
of Joa Pharmaceutical...

50:31.362 --> 50:32.780
Windazole?

50:33.197 --> 50:34.073
Can I help you?

50:34.073 --> 50:36.200
Can I get Windazole?

50:36.200 --> 50:38.077
We don't have
that brand of vermicide.

50:39.871 --> 50:41.289
Sorry about that.

50:41.581 --> 50:43.291
Hello?

50:43.291 --> 50:45.001
- Windazole!
- Windazole, please!

51:07.774 --> 51:08.983
Hey!

51:08.983 --> 51:11.194
We've got a stock of Windazole,
don't we?

51:11.194 --> 51:12.070
Who needs it?

51:12.070 --> 51:13.488
My wife and kids are infected.

51:13.488 --> 51:15.281
How did that happen?

51:15.281 --> 51:16.491
Do we have it or not?

51:16.991 --> 51:18.701
- We don't!
- How come?

51:18.701 --> 51:21.204
The dispensary department made
an inquiry to the head office.

51:21.204 --> 51:22.205
But it's out of stock.

51:22.205 --> 51:23.956
But it doesn't make sense!

51:23.956 --> 51:26.375
Does it make sense that
it's the only known cure?

51:26.375 --> 51:28.377
The product was discontinued
as of last October.

51:28.377 --> 51:30.254
It's a product
we never cared about.

51:30.254 --> 51:32.673
There's gotta be pharmacies
we supplied to until discontinuation.

51:32.673 --> 51:35.468
I've been contacting them.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.261
I'm only half way
through the list

51:37.386 --> 51:39.764
but so far, there isn't a single
pharmacy that has it.

51:39.764 --> 51:41.891
Jae-hyeok! Jae-hyeok!

51:42.391 --> 51:43.601
I don't understand.

51:43.601 --> 51:46.604
It's been discontinued
for poor sales.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.397
How can it be
the magical cure?

51:48.397 --> 51:50.274
Even at this point,
it's extremely fortunate.

51:50.274 --> 51:53.277
If not for Windazole, we would have
a much greater catastrophe .

51:53.277 --> 51:54.904
I trust you'll spur
the production of the drug.

51:54.904 --> 51:56.948
We'll support you
with all means necessary.

51:56.948 --> 52:00.076
It'll take us some time
to reactivate production

52:00.076 --> 52:02.662
but we'll do our best.

52:02.662 --> 52:03.663
What about the crude drug?

52:03.663 --> 52:05.957
We still have them
in storage.

52:05.957 --> 52:09.377
That's a relief! What's the maximum
production capacity?

52:09.377 --> 52:11.295
100,000 doses a day.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.380
Excuse me?

52:12.797 --> 52:14.298
That's ridiculously short.

52:14.298 --> 52:17.593
Unfortunately,
that's our maximum capacity

52:17.593 --> 52:20.304
provided the machinery can
hold out.

52:20.888 --> 52:23.182
They are quite old, you see.

52:23.182 --> 52:28.604
Shouldn't be a problem.

52:29.313 --> 52:32.984
You have nothing to worry about.
Let's give it our best effort.

52:32.984 --> 52:37.780
It's almost impossible to find
Windazole in local pharmacies.

52:37.780 --> 52:42.869
Only hours after the announcement,

52:42.869 --> 52:46.164
it appears all Windazole
in the market has dried up.

52:46.497 --> 52:51.294
We're making our best effort
to reactivate production

52:51.294 --> 52:54.172
but it's taking some time
to ready the manufacturing process.

52:54.172 --> 52:58.009
If we rush, we could get
the production running by tonight.

52:58.092 --> 52:59.510
although I can't guarantee that.

52:59.510 --> 53:02.013
Don't worry.
Daddy will bring us our medicine.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.849
It's made by your dad's company.

53:05.266 --> 53:07.977
When is he coming?

53:08.477 --> 53:09.854
In no time, sweetheart.

53:15.693 --> 53:18.696
Families of those infected,
please leave the premise.

53:18.696 --> 53:19.864
Get them out of here!

53:34.086 --> 53:36.756
Please calm yourselves
and listen to me.

53:36.756 --> 53:39.050
Please listen to me
for a second!

53:39.050 --> 53:41.677
What the hell are you doing?
Why are you isolating them?

53:41.677 --> 53:42.970
It's a measure stipulated
by the government.

53:42.970 --> 53:45.389
In order to protect
the lives of those infected.

53:45.389 --> 53:47.558
Shouldn't you let them
be with their families at least?

53:47.558 --> 53:49.894
We're running out of room

53:49.894 --> 53:53.981
and we could lose control
if they are mixed with their families.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.191
Do you understand?

53:55.191 --> 53:56.901
This is in your family's
best interest.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.904
Please cooperate if you don't
want to lose them forever.

54:26.973 --> 54:28.599
Over here!

54:39.110 --> 54:40.486
What about the medicine?

54:46.575 --> 54:48.160
That's okay, honey.

54:48.577 --> 54:51.163
Your company's going into
production from tomorrow.

55:22.361 --> 55:24.655
Police? Please hurry!

55:24.655 --> 55:27.867
There are infected people outside!
Come quick!

56:04.862 --> 56:06.364
Please let me through.

56:06.364 --> 56:08.199
My child is in pain.

56:24.048 --> 56:27.468
Don't you see they're in pain?
Let go of me.

56:28.386 --> 56:30.054
Jun-woo! Ye-ji!

56:30.054 --> 56:31.972
- Water...
- Water...

56:56.497 --> 57:00.167
The worst case scenario came true.

57:00.167 --> 57:04.463
Most deaths occurred among
the patients who weren't isolated.

57:04.463 --> 57:08.175
and those that broke out
of the camps.

57:08.175 --> 57:12.763
The onset of mental derangement
is triggered without a warning.

57:12.763 --> 57:15.975
So far, the onsets have mostly
occurred during the night.

57:15.975 --> 57:19.270
It also appears to trigger
a chain reaction.

57:19.270 --> 57:22.106
Therefore, keeping the infected
patients together in isolation

57:22.106 --> 57:24.608
could lead to devastating
consequences.

57:24.608 --> 57:27.194
At this rate, things will
only turn for the worse.

57:27.194 --> 57:29.989
We're still waiting for the update
on the time of delivery,

57:29.989 --> 57:32.867
we cannot advise you
the exact time at this point.

57:32.867 --> 57:34.076
- Chief!
- Please give it a little...

57:34.076 --> 57:35.953
Everyone is calling about the time.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.663
- Tell them not to wait!
- Excuse me?

57:37.663 --> 57:42.793
The motherfuckers didn't
produce a single pill!

57:42.793 --> 57:44.295
Why aren't we
getting the medicine?

57:44.295 --> 57:46.380
Joa failed to produce any!

57:46.380 --> 57:49.383
Liars! What did you do
with the pills?

57:49.383 --> 57:51.385
What are you accusing us of?

57:51.385 --> 57:52.678
What the hell
do you take us for?

57:52.678 --> 57:54.180
Sons of bitches!

58:01.395 --> 58:02.480
Bastards...

58:06.859 --> 58:08.152
- Hey.
- I got the pills.

58:08.152 --> 58:09.862
- What?
- I got the pills!

58:12.656 --> 58:13.782
I'm sorry.

58:14.492 --> 58:17.161
It's a line that's been
discontinued for so long.

58:17.161 --> 58:21.373
Rushed reactivation seems to
have caused an overload.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.502
The machinery is very outdated.

58:24.502 --> 58:28.297
I heard that Joa spends tens of millions
each year on kickbacks.

58:28.297 --> 58:31.800
If you used a fraction of that
to invest in new machinery!

58:33.093 --> 58:37.264
I don't know what to say.

58:37.348 --> 58:39.183
There is only
one solution now.

58:39.183 --> 58:42.478
Disclose the chemical
composition of Windazole.

58:42.478 --> 58:42.978
Beg your pardon?

58:42.978 --> 58:47.066
By making the composition available,

58:47.066 --> 58:50.361
Other manufacturers can use it
to produce Windazole?

58:50.361 --> 58:51.487
That's right.

58:51.487 --> 58:54.990
By activating production lines
in 20 pharmaceutical manufacturers,

58:54.990 --> 58:58.285
we can produce enough doses
for 1 million persons in a day.

58:58.285 --> 59:02.081
But you cannot compel a company
to release the composition formula.

59:02.081 --> 59:05.584
In a national emergency,
we can force them to disclose

59:05.584 --> 59:10.005
all data submitted to KFDA
relating to Windazole.

59:10.005 --> 59:13.050
All data except
the chemical composition,

59:13.050 --> 59:15.177
if I may correct you.

59:15.177 --> 59:20.182
It is impossible for us to disclose it
before the expiration of patent.

59:20.182 --> 59:23.269
That's why we're asking for
your cooperation.

59:23.269 --> 59:25.479
Even if we decide to disclose it,

59:25.479 --> 59:29.692
it'll take some time
for other manufacturers.

59:30.067 --> 59:32.987
To set up the precise
manufacturing process.

59:32.987 --> 59:36.407
If we allocate all available
labor and equipment,

59:36.407 --> 59:39.285
and bypass legal procedures

59:39.285 --> 59:42.788
we can expect to kicks tart
production within a week.

59:42.788 --> 59:44.957
- One week?
- That's correct.

59:44.957 --> 59:46.875
It's all very hopeful,

59:46.875 --> 59:49.878
but ultimately,
it comes down to Joa's decision.

59:49.878 --> 59:51.755
It's not a charitable organization.

59:51.755 --> 59:55.384
Do you believe that Joa will
agree to release the formula?

59:55.384 --> 59:59.888
The majority shareholder of Joa
Pharmaceutical is BronStar with 51%.

59:59.888 --> 01:00:02.391
They have the decision-making
authority.

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.602
Surely, it's a matter of
convincing them.

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.270
That's correct.

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:09.398
The government will guarantee
a very generous support and benefits.

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:12.109
And we can officialize it on paper,
if you wish.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:16.280
But should you reject our offer,
we'll dispatch our best auditors.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.365
To conduct the most scrupulous audit
on Joa Pharmaceutical.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.366
Prime Minister!

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.077
Offer us your cooperation
in good faith

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:26.373
or prepare to face an insurmountable
penalty tax and shut down the company.

01:00:26.582 --> 01:00:28.083
The decision is yours.

01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:34.465
Please go away!

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.967
There is no use
hassling us like this!

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.303
You're breaking the law
by doing this!

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.889
Give us the medicine!

01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:46.101
When are they
sending us a backup?

01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:01.575
- Did you bring the money?
- Of course!

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:02.785
Come with me!

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.376
Hey! It's me!

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:13.879
Let us through!
We're employees!

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:17.299
Hey, wait!

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:21.303
One of the employees went through
the storage room with a fine comb.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.305
And found a couple of boxes.

01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:26.975
It's his last remaining batch.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:31.563
Why are you letting them through?

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:33.482
They work here.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:42.366
Son of a bitch, charging
a grand for 3-dollar pills.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.867
- Take this.
- Thanks so much, man.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.993
Let's go.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.497
Let us out!

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.786
I just need three.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.997
Come on, take it!

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:34.084
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

01:02:34.877 --> 01:02:35.878
He's got the cure!

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.463
He has the pills!

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.381
He has the pills!

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:47.097
Let go of me!
No! Let me go!

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.956
Jae-hyeok!

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.471
Jae-hyeok!

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.809
Jae-hyeok! Jae-hyeok!

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.003
How did it go?

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:04.508
They rejected your offer.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.094
Have you lost your mind?

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:11.974
Cold-blooded bastard!

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:16.979
That was the last.

01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:19.982
Why did you take it out?

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.484
Damn it!

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:24.069
How are we supposed
to get them now?

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:29.783
Hello?

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.368
Dad?

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.370
Yes, big guy.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:37.499
Where are you, dad?
Please come quick!

01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:39.376
Jun-woo! Jun-woo!

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.549
Open the gates!

01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:51.972
Jae-hyeok.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.475
Why are they throwing out
the families?

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.060
I don't know.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.479
We can't produce the drug
any time soon.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:02.274
It's a precautionary measure.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:05.903
So, we're not supposed to know
if our family is dead or alive in there?

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:07.279
It's not like that.

01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:09.990
It's exactly like that!

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:15.412
They're keeping the patients
in isolation waiting for them to die!

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:16.580
The government is doing
their best...

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.081
Shut up!
I'm not taking any more crap!

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:32.971
Hey, Gyeong-sun.

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:36.266
Why are they taking them away?

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:38.393
It's uh...

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.481
Are they giving up on us?

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:44.983
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they do that?

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:47.194
Even if they do,
don't you give up on us.

01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:49.196
Don't be silly.
You gotta be strong for me.

01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:50.781
I'm never giving up on you!

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:52.866
Kids are barely holding out.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.868
I'm sorry.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:56.787
Forgive me.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:58.664
Don't say that.

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:01.458
You're doing all that you can.

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:04.878
Honey...

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:05.963
Yeah.

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:09.383
Did you eat?

01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:12.886
Stop worrying about me!
Worry about yourself for once!

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:17.474
All right.
I'll call you later.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:29.653
Hey.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:37.786
You've got to be strong
for your baby.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.886
They're gonna be fine.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.180
I can't even look out
for my own family.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.849
Why'd I try to be a saint?

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.852
Fucking idiot!

01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:07.065
Damn brainless moron!

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.785
Don't take it out on yourself.
You're not to blame.

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:28.295
It doesn't add up.

01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:30.005
Horsehair worm is not a virus.

01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:32.257
Yet, it managed to be rampant
everywhere.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:36.887
How did Windazole disappear
from the market so quickly?

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:39.056
Until the discontinuation,

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.558
100,000 boxes were
released in the market.

01:07:42.184 --> 01:07:47.564
Each box contains 4 doses, meaning
enough for 400,000 people.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:49.399
And within a few hours
of the announcement,

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.485
the medicine went
completely out of stock.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:56.073
Maybe they were not sold out.
Maybe they were never there.

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:57.074
Then what?

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:00.786
Someone may have hoarded it away.

01:08:00.786 --> 01:08:03.080
Maybe it's being sold
on the black market.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.957
Well, the production team
told me...

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.668
Hey! Where are you going?

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:10.170
Jae-hyeok!

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:13.465
These are the people
who bought the shares?

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:14.758
They're all similar.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:18.095
No jobs or known addresses.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:20.680
Not a likely person
to buy shares.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.765
What are you suggesting?

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:24.475
They're using surrogates to
anonymously purchase the shares.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:26.185
- Who?
- No idea.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.770
You, piece of crap!

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:31.399
But one of them did
something stupid.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.276
Somebody always leaves
a trace.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:37.572
A mentally disabled old man working
at a mushroom farm bought shares.

01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:39.783
And one of the farm
owner's sons...

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:40.867
Yes?

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.453
His eldest son is a researcher
at a pharmaceutical company.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.080
None other than...

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:48.082
Joa Pharmaceutical!

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:55.090
How about this?

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:59.803
The government should
take over the company.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:04.182
Then, the composition will naturally
become the property of the government.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.977
What our investors want is profit.

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:10.479
If you offer a favorable price,
they'll take it.

01:09:10.856 --> 01:09:12.064
Prime Minister.

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.282
Windazole

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:53.064
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:56.359
The bugs are growing
at a remarkable rate.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:00.697
It only takes them 3 to 4 months
to fully develop.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:04.284
We cannot regard them
in typical biological terms.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.493
So what?

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:10.207
Once the infected show
a sign of severe thirst,

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:14.586
their appetite disappears and
they ask only for water.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.671
Once this symptom is
triggered,

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:21.259
almost all the infected were reported
to have died within 3 days.

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:24.262
Only when they were left
uncontrolled?

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:29.684
You seem to believe that death can be
avoided by preventing access to water.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:34.689
You need to understand
that it's not as simple as that.

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.066
How do you mean?

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:39.277
There'll come a day
where it takes its toll.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:40.570
Meaning?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:44.491
At some point, the bug will
put up its last-ditch fight.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:49.996
The safety of those infected cannot be
guaranteed in such circumstances.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.165
The reason they suffer is

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:57.379
because the bug is
trying to force its way out.

01:10:57.379 --> 01:11:00.090
If the effort is hampered
by an external factor

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:06.471
it will put up the final battle
for survival with all its might.

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:09.766
Sorry, we only have water.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.393
- Doctor...
- One moment, please.

01:11:11.393 --> 01:11:15.397
My kids have a stomachache
and terrible eczema.

01:11:15.397 --> 01:11:18.775
We're not allowed
to give out anything.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:22.612
Something most horrific
will happen.

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:25.156
The worms will go crazy,

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:30.662
and the infected patients will face
the worst imaginable situation.

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:33.290
That's absurd!

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.958
How long do they have?

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:38.169
It could be today
or in few days.

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:40.088
We must supply them with drugs
before it happens.

01:11:40.088 --> 01:11:44.301
If not, we'll be faced with
the most dreadful tragedy in history.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.598
Name your price.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.479
Room 502?
Got it. I'm on my way.

01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:56.581
Who is it?

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.584
I just spoke to you
on the phone.

01:13:01.086 --> 01:13:03.296
- You came alone?
- Yes.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.549
It's your lucky day.
It's my last box.

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.760
- You have the money?
- Of course.

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:11.388
Here.

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:14.891
One moment.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.273
Mom...

01:13:27.779 --> 01:13:30.782
Freeze! Police!

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.991
Hey!

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.493
Open the door.

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:35.703
Open the goddamn door!

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:39.165
Where's he gone?

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.084
Son of a bitch!

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:44.254
Damn it!

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:48.091
Sneaky bastard!
Where is the medicine?

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:50.593
I don't know
what you're talking about!

01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:56.683
Mom...

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:09.612
Please...
Please... please...

01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:11.656
Stop it!

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.955
Get a hold of yourself
or you'll end up dead!

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:25.295
Please! Snap out of it!

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:28.965
Watch your kids over there!

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:39.809
You told me
to think about my baby.

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:44.063
I got them off the internet, too.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:44.856
Shut up!

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:08.796
- Hello?
- It's me.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.509
You, goddamn cops...

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:14.385
- I'm hanging up!
- Please!

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:15.887
Don't hang up!
Just hear me out!

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:18.681
What!

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.475
I know where
they're hiding Windazole.

01:15:20.475 --> 01:15:22.268
I'm on my way there now.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.357
Listen to me carefully.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.777
They orchestrated this situation
from the very beginning.

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:34.489
A plan carefully devised
by the researchers.

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:38.284
Take it easy, man.
Just calm down for a moment.

01:15:41.496 --> 01:15:43.081
There is no need for this.

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:47.085
I only invested in the future
of the company I work for.

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:51.881
I borrowed the names because
I can't buy my company's shares.

01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:56.886
Wanna continue
with this game?

01:16:01.558 --> 01:16:03.184
How about it?

01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:07.772
No-one will bat an eyelid
if you were found dead.

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:09.774
No-one will even notice.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.693
I'll tell you!

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:19.284
Long time ago, before
the company was bought out.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.912
A special research project
was launched

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.957
with full support
of the former CEO.

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:27.875
A top secret project

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:31.588
inspired by horsehair
worm's ability

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:34.591
to manipulate
the host's brain.

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.968
We were going to make

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:39.095
a ground-breaking cure
for brain diseases

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.472
if we can discover
the secret behind

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:44.267
the protein material
that the worms produce.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:46.477
It'll be a break-through

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:49.272
for treating incurable
central nerve illnesses

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:52.108
such as brain tumors
and Alzheimer's.

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:54.193
A game changer

01:16:54.402 --> 01:16:56.779
that will change the shape of
the world's pharmaceutical market forever.

01:16:57.572 --> 01:17:01.659
The first stage of research was
to create a mutant

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:03.953
that uses mammals as a host.

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:08.791
And after countless attempts,
we succeeded.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:12.086
Unlocking the first barrier.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:17.800
Then all of a sudden, the company was
taken over by BronStar.

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:22.180
And the newly appointed CEO
dismantled the R&D department.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:27.894
They were trade men who had no interest
in new drug development.

01:17:29.187 --> 01:17:32.649
The former CEO who had his company
snatched from his hand killed himself,

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:34.651
and the research was put to stop.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:38.363
Everything was left hanging.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:41.658
And then...

01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:43.660
This is just ridiculous!

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.286
One of us jokingly
suggested that

01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:48.998
we make some profit
out of the research.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:49.999
Cheers!

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:57.298
In an highly emotional situation,
we unanimously agreed to do it .

01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:01.010
So, you developed a cure,

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:05.556
put in the market
as a common vermicide,

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:08.976
released mutant horsehair worms
and bought the company shares.

01:18:10.061 --> 01:18:11.270
That's correct.

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:14.065
You deplorable rat!

01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:16.192
You murdered thousands of people
to manipulate the share price?

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.486
We had no idea how dramatically
things would escalated out of control,

01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:20.988
We estimated tens of
thousand infected

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:23.282
and perhaps,
under a hundred dead.

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:28.996
You know, that's a lot less than
the number killed by flu each year.

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.708
Crazy motherfuckers!
What do you take the human life for?

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:32.875
Once it became
a national issue

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.712
and the share price
reached our target,

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:36.754
we were going to
clean out the shares

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.881
and release the medicine
back into the market.

01:18:39.257 --> 01:18:42.260
What do you mean you were
going to release the drug?

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:44.762
You have some stashed away?

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:48.683
About 100,000 doses.

01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:50.184
Where are you keeping it?

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.272
Where?

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:12.165
Jae-hyeok!

01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:14.250
Where is the medicine?

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:15.460
Let go of me!

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.587
Son of a bitch,
where did you hide it?

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:19.088
Over there!
It's all kept in there!

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:22.592
Wait!

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:26.262
- Open the door now.
- Let's wait for Yeon-ju!

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.181
I have the keys.

01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:31.893
She's bringing a transport
for the medicine.

01:19:31.893 --> 01:19:33.478
I don't want to hear it!

01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:34.771
Don't you know how hard
Yeon-ju is working for us?

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.481
Don't trust anyone!

01:19:36.481 --> 01:19:38.274
I told her not to tell anyone.

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:39.275
Where is the damn medicine?

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:42.987
Bra!

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.280
Over here!

01:19:56.667 --> 01:20:00.087
That's the medicine, isn't it?
Bastards!

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:07.970
Windazole...
They have Windazole.

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.972
This...

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:13.184
Sons of bitches.

01:20:20.358 --> 01:20:21.275
Jae-hyeok!

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:23.361
- No!
- Are you okay?

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:25.780
No! No, no, no!

01:20:31.077 --> 01:20:32.370
No!

01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:33.663
- Let go! No!
- No, damn it!

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:34.664
Let me go!

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.269
Hey!

01:20:56.769 --> 01:21:00.356
We're all going to die here!

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.483
Get a hold of yourself, man!

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:05.778
Goddammit!

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:24.463
Jae-pH?

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:27.884
Wake up, man!

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:41.564
This isn't why I called you.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:46.068
I always wanted you
to be happy.

01:21:47.278 --> 01:21:49.906
- You know that, don't you?
- Save your breath, idiot!

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:55.703
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, bro.

01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:00.666
We're walking out of here together.
Stay with me, all right?

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:03.252
Jae-hyeok!

01:22:23.481 --> 01:22:24.190
Jae-hyeok!

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:33.157
Jae-hyeok!
Wake up, man!

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.657
Jae-hyeok!
Are you in there? Jae-pil!

01:23:14.991 --> 01:23:18.160
Answer me!

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:20.371
Jae-pil!

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.174
Jae-hyeok!

01:23:32.383 --> 01:23:33.384
Jae-hyeok!

01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:40.474
Hey, you all right?

01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:41.851
How do you feel?

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.576
Where are you going?
You're not allowed past here.

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:48.584
Gyeong-sun!

01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:50.377
Jae-hyeok...

01:24:50.878 --> 01:24:51.879
Yeah.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.090
Where are you?

01:24:54.465 --> 01:24:55.966
What's wrong, honey?

01:24:57.176 --> 01:25:02.598
They're taking away our cellphones
I wanted to talk to you last.

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:04.100
What?

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:08.604
In case we don't meet again.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:12.608
There is something
I want you to know.

01:25:13.484 --> 01:25:16.278
What the hell are you saying?

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.280
Honey.

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:21.951
I don't want you
to blame yourself.

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.287
You did everything you could.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:26.872
Stop it!

01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:32.670
You've always been a good husband
and a good father.

01:25:33.087 --> 01:25:35.881
Don't say that.
Why would you say that?

01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:39.677
You can't do this.
You gotta stay strong, dummy!

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:46.475
I want to,
but I'm not feeling like myself.

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:49.687
I'm not sure any more.
I'm sorry.

01:25:49.687 --> 01:25:51.355
I'm not gonna hear of this.

01:25:51.564 --> 01:25:54.859
You're not gonna make
my children motherless kids.

01:25:57.987 --> 01:26:01.365
Jun-woo, say hi to your dad.

01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:03.284
Dad.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.660
Jun-woo.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.371
I miss you, dad...

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:17.173
Ye-ji, It's your dad...

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:20.885
Dad...

01:26:20.885 --> 01:26:23.971
Baby, it's daddy.
Daddy's right here.

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:28.058
When are you coming?

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:31.979
I'll be there real soon.
I'll bring you your medicine.

01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:34.481
Wait for me a little longer.

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.566
Dad...

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:36.859
No, not my cellphone!

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:43.991
Hello?
Ye-ji! Ye-ji!

01:26:44.283 --> 01:26:46.285
Hello? Hello?

01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:18.692
You don't have to confiscate
their cellphones!

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:19.902
Don't you know
what's going on?

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:22.571
The situation inside the camp
is being broadcasted live.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:25.574
Thanks to that twitter crap,
it's stirring up the public!

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:28.202
You're freaking out
the infected people.

01:27:28.202 --> 01:27:29.954
Why are you escalating
the situation?

01:27:29.954 --> 01:27:33.374
Public security is as important
as the well-being of those infected.

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.960
What about the uninfected?

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.254
Do you want the whole country
to come to a standstill?

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:41.382
I don't know how disturbed
the public is by the epidemic

01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:45.594
but could they be more in pain
than the infected?

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.680
Just a while longer.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.598
All we need is another week!

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:07.658
Worms came out of her mouth!

01:28:07.658 --> 01:28:10.160
Call for medical attention!

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:17.960
Jae-hyeok.

01:28:20.879 --> 01:28:24.174
Everything will be fine.
Don't worry.

01:28:24.675 --> 01:28:27.594
The government is taking over
Joa Pharmaceutical.

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:31.598
Then, they will disclose
the composition of the drug

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:35.311
so that other pharmaceutical
manufacturers can duplicate it.

01:28:35.311 --> 01:28:41.066
We just need to hold out for a week
for them to prepare the process.

01:28:42.568 --> 01:28:45.487
Ta-ta!
A natural soap bar made by dad!

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:46.655
Wow!

01:28:47.281 --> 01:28:49.658
That's not soap.

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:53.370
Soap is supposed
to be square or round.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:55.164
This soap is the same.

01:28:55.164 --> 01:28:58.876
The most important thing
in making a soap is fatty acid.

01:28:58.876 --> 01:29:02.880
That's what gets rid of the grime
from your hands.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.506
As long as it contains it

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:07.801
it doesn't matter
if it's star- or heart-shaped.

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:09.011
It's still soap all the same.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:10.346
Jae-hyeok!

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:13.682
They won't last another day.

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:14.975
Where is the crude drug kept?

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.561
In the production headquarters.

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:18.562
Let's go!

01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:20.356
Hey!

01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:22.191
This is nonsense!

01:29:22.191 --> 01:29:26.070
5 years ago, BronStar took over
Joa for a mere 700 million.

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:27.863
They bought a solid company

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:31.367
through a ledger manipulation
scheme and by turning it

01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:33.077
into an insolvent enterprise.

01:29:33.077 --> 01:29:37.706
Now they're trying to sell it
for 5 billion?

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:40.376
He has a point.

01:29:40.376 --> 01:29:42.586
If other pharmaceutical
companies found out...

01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:45.047
What choice do we have?

01:29:47.758 --> 01:29:49.968
Is it really possible?

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.554
As long as you have the crude drug,
you can make Windazole right away?

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:55.057
It doesn't matter
if it's square or star-shaped.

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:57.393
- It'll have the same effects.
- So, effectively,

01:29:57.893 --> 01:29:59.895
we're making
a knockoff Windazole?

01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:00.896
Something like that.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.693
Where are you?

01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:10.406
You have to listen very carefully
to what I say now.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:13.575
Grab a hold of the chairman
of the Pharmaceutical Association.

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.285
We need the help
of all manufacturers.

01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:19.081
Did you find anything?

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:23.669
The rest of the researchers have
fled the country a long time ago.

01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:28.090
Only the team leader remained
to take care of the stash.

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:31.468
You got to him before
he got rid of the medicine.

01:30:31.468 --> 01:30:33.095
- Wait a minute
- What?

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:35.472
- Did you say the 'team leader'?
- Yeah. Why?

01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:37.474
The one that got killed
in the warehouse?

01:30:37.474 --> 01:30:38.892
He was the team leader.

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:40.477
Son of a bitch!

01:30:40.477 --> 01:30:44.898
The team head and Joa's CEO
are classmates.

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:48.193
I've seen pictures of them together.
They've been friends for a long time.

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:49.403
Can you smell a rat?

01:30:49.403 --> 01:30:51.780
The Chief's been summoned
by the Commissioner.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.157
Fine!

01:30:55.576 --> 01:30:59.079
I don't think it was a plan
devised by the researchers alone.

01:30:59.079 --> 01:30:59.955
What?

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:01.874
The dead researcher was
the team leader.

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:04.877
He must have conspired
with the CEO.

01:31:05.169 --> 01:31:07.671
You see, this was
masterminded by the top brass.

01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:09.381
I'm on the sign of the contract.

01:31:10.591 --> 01:31:12.968
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:14.094
Yes, sir.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.099
Good job.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:23.479
This is the one.

01:31:24.855 --> 01:31:25.856
Windazole?

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:31.570
That's it?
All this for the money?

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:33.363
Looks like it.

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:34.990
Heartless motherfuckers!

01:31:38.368 --> 01:31:38.994
Hello?

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.078
- Where are you?
- Why?

01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:43.290
I'm at the isolation camp.
Something terrible is going on.

01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:46.084
I don't know
what's happening,

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:47.878
but tons of bodybags are
being carried out.

01:31:47.878 --> 01:31:49.671
Shouldn't you be here?

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.007
Stop the car!
Pull over, now!

01:31:57.346 --> 01:31:58.263
Why?

01:31:58.764 --> 01:32:00.349
Check in on my wife and kids!

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:01.266
What?

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:03.185
I swear I'll kill you
if anything happens to them!

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:05.687
- What about you?
- Just go, damn it!

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:18.867
Stop them!

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:42.558
Please!
Hear me out for a moment!

01:32:42.558 --> 01:32:45.060
I beg you!
Listen to what I have to say!

01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:53.277
Please!
Listen to me for a second!

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:55.904
There is a crude form
of the cure in there.

01:32:56.405 --> 01:32:59.074
With the crude drug,
we can save our families.

01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:01.493
Please help me get inside.

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:04.746
Help me help all our families!

01:33:04.955 --> 01:33:07.457
Please help me!

01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:10.877
I beg of you, please!

01:33:11.461 --> 01:33:12.588
Help me!

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:15.090
Let's help him!
Come on, everyone!

01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:47.289
Formally, Hyoin Pharmaceutical here
will own 51% of Joa's shares

01:33:47.289 --> 01:33:49.082
with the government
as the guarantor.

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:50.959
Upon request of
Joa Pharmaceutical,

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:52.878
the two CEOs will
sign the agreement.

01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:55.172
With the Prime Minister's
signature

01:33:55.172 --> 01:33:57.591
the agreement will
take immediate effect.

01:33:57.591 --> 01:33:58.884
Let's get a move on!

01:34:20.072 --> 01:34:21.782
Prime Minister! Wait!

01:34:28.288 --> 01:34:30.666
Is there a problem?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.087
You piece of shit bastard!

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:40.676
Stop them!
Don't back off!

01:35:20.549 --> 01:35:21.675
What's that?

01:35:23.552 --> 01:35:24.678
Get him!

01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:29.057
I'm the squad leader!

01:35:29.057 --> 01:35:30.392
Don't stop him!

01:35:30.976 --> 01:35:33.979
- Sir?
- Leave him alone!

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:51.163
What do you think
you're doing?

01:35:51.163 --> 01:35:53.457
Where are you keeping
the crude drug for Windazole?

01:36:08.597 --> 01:36:09.765
Don't look...

01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:15.479
Mom, my throat's itching.

01:36:15.479 --> 01:36:16.605
What?

01:36:16.605 --> 01:36:18.690
Mine, too.

01:36:21.485 --> 01:36:22.903
It's because you're thirsty.

01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:24.654
Drink some water
and you'll be fine.

01:37:20.502 --> 01:37:21.294
Here.

01:37:21.586 --> 01:37:24.005
I've never been inside
the storage room myself.

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:27.801
Only an executive
with their own key

01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:29.511
could go inside.

01:37:41.064 --> 01:37:42.065
No!

01:37:42.482 --> 01:37:44.860
If you press that,
everyone here will be killed!

01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:47.988
No!

01:37:55.704 --> 01:37:56.788
Get out of my way!

01:38:19.185 --> 01:38:22.272
Jun-woo, take your sister
and get up on the podium!

01:38:22.272 --> 01:38:24.983
Go on! Hurry!

01:39:02.771 --> 01:39:05.106
Please don't come near me!

01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:31.091
Come on, everyone!
Give us a hand!

01:39:32.467 --> 01:39:34.469
We're trying to save lives here!

01:39:34.469 --> 01:39:35.679
Hand it over!

01:39:35.679 --> 01:39:37.472
Get a forklift!

01:39:49.776 --> 01:39:50.652
Out Of my way!

01:39:55.156 --> 01:39:56.366
Get out of the way!

01:40:23.977 --> 01:40:25.562
What now?

01:40:25.562 --> 01:40:27.981
Manufactured drugs
consist of a crude drug

01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:30.483
and excipient that controls
the rate of its effects.

01:40:30.483 --> 01:40:33.570
Each manufacturer have their own
lines of vermicides in production, right?

01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:35.488
Leave the excipient,

01:40:35.488 --> 01:40:39.868
and only add the crude drug
to create mockup Windazole.

01:40:39.868 --> 01:40:42.078
Let's not go into the legality
of this process.

01:40:42.078 --> 01:40:44.205
Let's think about saving lives
for now.

01:40:44.706 --> 01:40:46.791
- When are we getting the crude drug?
- Any minute now.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:48.585
There it comes!

01:40:58.178 --> 01:41:00.764
The crude drug was passed onto
the Pharmaceutical Association just now.

01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:04.184
All participating manufacturers
will go into production by tonight.

01:41:04.184 --> 01:41:05.393
Yeah!

01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:08.271
Song Yeon-ju!

01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:12.067
Good job.
We did the right thing, huh?

01:41:35.381 --> 01:41:36.257
Jae-hyeok!

01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:38.176
Over here!

01:41:38.176 --> 01:41:39.469
Jun-woo! Ye-ji!

01:41:39.469 --> 01:41:41.679
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:52.398
You held out, my darling!
Good job.

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:06.579
Come here, Gyeong-sun.

01:42:35.358 --> 01:42:38.778
With the collective help of more than
20 pharmaceutical manufacturers,

01:42:38.778 --> 01:42:40.488
mass produced
horsehair worm remedy

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:43.992
is being delivered to
quarantine stations everywhere.

01:43:25.074 --> 01:43:27.202
Please step back!
Coming through, please!

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:40.965
James Kim,
the CEO of Joa Pharmaceutical

01:43:40.965 --> 01:43:42.967
planned the epidemic 5 years ago.

01:43:42.967 --> 01:43:47.388
They just gave up
on being human.

01:43:47.388 --> 01:43:48.556
Goddamned vermin.

01:43:48.556 --> 01:43:52.477
You should feel ashamed of yourself
thinking only about money.

01:43:52.477 --> 01:43:56.564
I learned my lesson
the hard way.

01:43:58.483 --> 01:44:02.570
So many mutant variants
in the world, huh?

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:06.074
Stop babbling and finish your food.
We'll be late for the play.

01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:14.374
Slow down, silly.
Have some kimchi.

01:44:14.374 --> 01:44:17.377
Jun-woo, hold on tight!

01:44:18.461 --> 01:44:20.380
They're really loving it.

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.257
It's been a while.

01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:24.759
I've been a terrible dad.

01:44:24.759 --> 01:44:26.761
You've been busy.

01:44:27.387 --> 01:44:28.763
I'm sorry, Gyeong-sun.

01:44:29.472 --> 01:44:31.266
There is no need for that.

01:44:31.474 --> 01:44:33.101
Dad!

01:44:33.101 --> 01:44:34.477
And thank you.

01:44:34.602 --> 01:44:35.687
What for?

01:44:35.687 --> 01:44:37.105
For pulling through.

01:44:38.106 --> 01:44:40.191
Well, thank you for saving my life.

01:44:43.361 --> 01:44:44.946
Shall we take
a family trip abroad?

01:44:44.946 --> 01:44:46.072
Abroad?

01:44:46.072 --> 01:44:48.157
We've never been
with the kids.

01:44:48.283 --> 01:44:49.575
Where to?

01:44:49.575 --> 01:44:51.452
Anywhere is fine,

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:53.454
as long as
they have tons of pharmacies.

01:44:53.871 --> 01:44:57.083
You're worried there'll be
horsehair worms abroad?

01:44:59.585 --> 01:45:00.795
What's the matter, honey?
