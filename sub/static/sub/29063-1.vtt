22:37.056 --> 22:39.357
[woman]
<i>You forgot something else.</i>

22:40.927 --> 22:41.992

22:42.628 --> 22:44.662
No. Not real.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.430
[woman] <i>That young girl...</i>
Phantom.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.399
<i>...with her family.</i>

22:49.836 --> 22:51.135
I didn't do anything.

22:52.105 --> 22:56.374
<i>She's so pretty. So young.</i>

22:57.643 --> 22:59.510
<i>Did he see her, too?</i>
No.

23:00.513 --> 23:05.549
He's not real. Aaron is not real.
Dr. Bauer said so.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.561
[knocking]

23:21.100 --> 23:22.800
Yes?

23:22.802 --> 23:26.003
Uh, my name is Monica Barfield.
I'm your new neighbor.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.839
I just moved in across
the street-- Oh!

23:29.909 --> 23:33.144
I am such a...
I'm such a klutz.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.084
I'll take this back.
You don't wanna eat it after...

23:41.521 --> 23:43.654
- Not that your floor is dirty--
- What do you want?

23:45.658 --> 23:46.757
Nothing. Just...

23:47.860 --> 23:49.026
Nothing?

23:49.162 --> 23:51.162
Did I say my name
is Monica Barfield?

23:53.166 --> 23:55.966
Okay. That makes me
an airhead and a klutz.

23:56.803 --> 23:57.902
[chuckles]

23:57.904 --> 24:00.871
These really would be happier
in the fridge.

24:01.707 --> 24:04.909
The kitchen...
It's this way? Yeah.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.148
My mother always said I was
like a bull in a china shop.

24:14.687 --> 24:15.886
I know who you are.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.956
I'm Monica Barfield,
your new neighbor.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.730
I know who you are.

24:25.731 --> 24:26.831
- Did I leave something out?
- You and I both know.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.203
- Who?
- She sent you to check up on me.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.504
Afraid not.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.873
You are not
who you say you are.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.242
Let's call Dr. Bauer
and ask her.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.778
No. Okay, okay, okay.
You got me.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.483
I'm a writer.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.718
You should leave now.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.488
No, but I wanna tell your story.
I have no story to tell.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.890
No. I wanna tell your story
from your point of view.

24:52.892 --> 24:56.494
To share your pain and torment
with those who have condemned you.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.128
Not interested.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.964
You would have the final approval
of every word in the book.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.233
Will you at least
think about it, sir?

25:02.235 --> 25:03.968
Think about all the people
it will help.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.071
[sighs]

25:08.641 --> 25:09.807
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

25:12.512 --> 25:15.112
How about, if you change your
mind and your answer is yes,

25:15.815 --> 25:17.548
all you have to do is

25:18.117 --> 25:20.618
place your broom on the
opposite side of the front door.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.286
That'll be our signal.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.524
Good night.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.862
[latch clicks]

25:41.707 --> 25:43.073
[muffled screams]

25:45.545 --> 25:47.011
What the hell
are you playing at?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.047
I'm calling the police.
Who the hell--

25:50.049 --> 25:51.849
I am the police, goddamn it.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.555
Don't you know who that is?
Bringing cupcakes over there.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.924
I do. He's a serial killer.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.561
Uh-huh? Yeah, well,
then you must have a death wish.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.630
I'm a writer, a journalist.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.732
[laughs]
I'm gonna get his story.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.736
Yeah. Yeah.
And I'm Buddy Ebsen, okay?

26:13.205 --> 26:16.240
You ain't no goddamn journalist.
I know your Realtor.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.309
She told me all about you.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.044
Said you were...

26:21.280 --> 26:24.815
unfazed by
your infamous neighbor.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.353
You never published an article in
your whole fucking life or mine.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.255
All right? Monica Barfield?

26:31.257 --> 26:33.691
You ain't no journalist.
You don't even exist.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.162
Well, too bad,

26:38.965 --> 26:40.664
Detective Dechert.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.166
Who the fuck are you?

26:44.136 --> 26:45.736
I look just like her,
don't I?

26:49.075 --> 26:51.275
But you were too late
to save her.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.377
Peter's last victim?

26:54.914 --> 26:56.213
No way. This can't be.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.882
- My sister.
- Jesus.

26:59.952 --> 27:03.120
And you're officially retired.
You're not even a cop anymore.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.922
You're just Doyle.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.125
You know what, kiddo?

27:09.128 --> 27:11.929
I'll take my badge
to my grave, all right?

27:12.231 --> 27:14.898
You better have something to drink
around here. We got to chitchat.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.936
I have whiskey.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.270
Good.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.940
Why don't you get it out.
I might drink the whole bottle.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.945
I got two questions
for you, missy.

27:29.649 --> 27:30.748
Fire away.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.853
You think that murdering little
piece of shit really got cured?

27:35.855 --> 27:37.021
[pouring]

27:37.023 --> 27:38.322
Do I look like an idiot?

27:39.659 --> 27:40.958
What's your second question?

27:41.127 --> 27:42.426
What are you up to?

27:47.033 --> 27:48.165
Win his trust.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.833
[laughs]

27:49.835 --> 27:51.235
To do what with?

27:51.437 --> 27:52.970
That's a third question.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.342
You know something? I don't think you
understand what I'm talking about.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.112
How old were you when all that happened?
Four? Five?

28:02.682 --> 28:03.781
Fourteen.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.919
Your sister
and the other victims...

28:09.288 --> 28:11.055
I don't even like
to think about it.

28:11.057 --> 28:16.226
Some of those victims were a lot
bigger and stronger than you, too.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.297
I've been training for this
my entire life.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.932
Yeah, well...

28:23.903 --> 28:25.235
I don't think
it's gonna be enough.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.008
Well, we'll have to see
about that.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.211
Good night, Detective Dechert.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.319
[footsteps fading]

29:05.811 --> 29:07.077
She was real.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.162
She's remarkable.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.040
Mmm.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.867
[sighs] Crap.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.143
[hammer tapping]

30:27.493 --> 30:30.260
[hits echoing]

30:40.940 --> 30:43.440
- Want this back?
- I didn't move the broom.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.110
I know.
It's been three days.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.479
Do you want
your cupcake plate back?

30:49.915 --> 30:53.350
No. I'm gonna start writing
my best seller starring you.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.519
I have work to do.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.560
<i>Ilex verticillata.</i>
I wouldn't plant those there.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.430
It's Latin.
I minored in botany.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.933
- [metal clanks]
- Why not?

31:10.636 --> 31:11.935
I'm sorry?

31:13.305 --> 31:14.872
Plant them there?

31:15.608 --> 31:17.441
[clears throat] Oh. Um...

31:18.210 --> 31:21.578
Well, the location isn't
conducive for optimal growth

31:21.580 --> 31:25.315
as the sun field and the
eave's drip line will just...

31:28.621 --> 31:29.920
Point taken.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.594
Did you spend a lot of
time here as a child?

31:37.596 --> 31:40.330
I know when your mom died,
you lived with your uncle.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.566
He was a pillar
of the community, they say--

31:42.568 --> 31:44.134
I don't remember any of that.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.569
[woman] <i> Liar.</i>
<i>Tell her what he did to you.</i>

31:46.438 --> 31:48.305
<i>- Peter?</i>
- Did the electroshock therapy--

31:48.307 --> 31:50.274
- No!
<i>- Show her what he did to you.</i>

31:51.076 --> 31:54.511
<i>Show her where he touched you.</i>
I'm fine now.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.049
What about your friends?
Did you ever talk about--

31:59.051 --> 32:01.652
I only had one friend during
the summers that I spent here.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.553
Aaron?
No!

32:07.126 --> 32:09.059
I never said that
I would cooperate with you.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.528
[knocking]

32:13.198 --> 32:14.564
How long were you out there?

32:16.201 --> 32:17.301
A couple of minutes.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.938
Are you spying on me?

32:21.573 --> 32:24.608
As a matter of fact,
I'm watching your ass.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.313
What was that gardening
charade all about anyway?

32:29.949 --> 32:32.616
I think you can
sleuth that out, Detective.

32:33.686 --> 32:38.422
[laughs] Let's not forget
he's a fucking psychopath, okay?

32:40.559 --> 32:42.693
And the only time
he's not nervous is...

32:43.629 --> 32:45.662
when he's got you
tied down to a table.

32:47.366 --> 32:48.465
Maybe so.

32:50.536 --> 32:53.370
But I think he's privately
intrigued by the whole book idea.

32:53.739 --> 32:59.543
Yeah, well, either that or he's sizing
you up for his new line of dolls.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.985

I'm not a baby, Uncle Charles.
I'm a grown-up boy.

Oh, you are, are you?

33:59.038 --> 34:00.237
Well, then...

34:00.239 --> 34:05.675
I guess you're ready to play
some real grown-up-boy games.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.511
You bet I am.

34:07.513 --> 34:11.648
Let's play my favorite.
It's called rock, paper, scissors.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.382
[chuckles]
That's a funny game.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.119
Oh, it's a very funny game.

34:18.524 --> 34:22.259
The loser
in rock, paper, scissors...

34:23.161 --> 34:24.661
has to let the winner...

That sounds like fun,
Uncle Charles.

[chuckling] Oh, yeah. It is.
I just wanna fiddle a bit.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.076

34:41.280 --> 34:42.746
Okay, Peter.

We can take breaks.

Oh. Well, that's good.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.642
So, what is it?

35:49.481 --> 35:53.216
All right, why don't we
talk about the 13 victims.

Um, do you recall
why you chose them?

35:57.856 --> 35:59.156
No.

He never existed.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.413
by Dr. Bauer's
electrotherapy.

39:10.415 --> 39:11.948
Ah, yes.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.385
Destructive Doyle Dechert.
Isn't that what the media called you?

39:15.587 --> 39:17.554
[laughs] Fuck you.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.589
Oh, how nice.
If you'll excuse me.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.358
No, no, no. Please.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.759
Why don't you leave
Mr. Harris alone?

39:24.996 --> 39:26.496
Leave him alone?

39:26.497 --> 39:27.997
Why would I leave him alone when he
hasn't told me about Mary Marquez?

39:27.999 --> 39:29.666
Who is Mary Marquez?

39:29.668 --> 39:31.901
The girl that went missing
down in Laconia.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.604
I don't know that name. I can't remember
the last time I've even been to that town.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.974
You're a lying piece of shit.
What did you do with the body, Peter?

39:37.976 --> 39:39.409
Do you have a warrant?

39:39.411 --> 39:40.710
Because if you don't,
which I suspect,

39:40.712 --> 39:43.079
then you have no right
to harass this man.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.916
This man?
Well, that man is a killer.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.388
He has paid his debt
to society.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.489
[laughs]

39:52.891 --> 39:55.658
According to the liberals,
I suppose.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.428
If you have a problem with
our country's justice system,

39:58.430 --> 40:00.063
then you should go
lobby Congress.

40:01.633 --> 40:02.866
Why are you protecting him?

40:04.536 --> 40:08.104
I am working with Peter--
Mr. Harris-- on his life story.

40:08.106 --> 40:09.572
[laughs] Oh, really?

40:10.075 --> 40:12.575
Is there a chapter in the book
where you, uh...

40:14.012 --> 40:16.579
where he describes
carving up Angela Grant?

40:17.449 --> 40:20.950
Or a chapter, perhaps, where he
talks about the fact that she had a--

40:20.952 --> 40:23.653
- I'm gonna call the police.
- You should leave now.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.722
- [line rings]
- [operator on phone] <i> 911.</i>

40:25.724 --> 40:28.158
- Hi. Yes. Can you please send the police over to...
- All right. All right.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.494
Uh...

40:31.663 --> 40:34.631
Never mind.
Yeah. Thank you.

40:36.701 --> 40:38.435
[sighs]

40:38.437 --> 40:42.505
I'm sorry if I overstepped.
[stammers] I didn't mean to.

40:43.875 --> 40:44.974
It's okay.

40:50.449 --> 40:51.548
Okay.

40:58.457 --> 40:59.556
Tomorrow?

41:05.831 --> 41:06.963
[latch clicks]

41:15.841 --> 41:16.973
Are you out there?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.175
Doyle!

41:20.912 --> 41:22.011
[knocking]

41:22.547 --> 41:23.646
Bastard!

41:24.583 --> 41:26.516
Do you have any fucking idea...

41:28.153 --> 41:29.586
How mad that cop made you?

41:29.821 --> 41:30.920
Um...

41:31.156 --> 41:32.255
Yeah.

41:33.825 --> 41:34.924
Here.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.196
What...

41:40.198 --> 41:43.766
You hadn't eaten all day.
I had some left over.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.036
See you tomorrow?

41:48.673 --> 41:49.772
Okay.

42:05.524 --> 42:06.956
[footsteps fading]

42:17.802 --> 42:19.702
[door opens, closes]

42:23.742 --> 42:27.844
I took the liberty to go
shopping and buy some real food.

42:28.113 --> 42:30.046
And went by
the liquor store.

42:31.316 --> 42:32.715
Got the good stuff.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.687
That was quite a little
performance you put on there.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.689
It wasn't a performance,
dickwad.

42:41.793 --> 42:42.859
You going crazy now?

42:42.861 --> 42:44.227
Don't put this on me.

42:44.963 --> 42:48.698
What did you think
you were doing?

42:48.700 --> 42:50.233
I was trying to get
a reaction out of him.

42:50.235 --> 42:53.269
By outing me? You want him to kill me?
Is that it?

42:54.039 --> 42:56.573
He kills me,
you can finally give him the needle?

42:57.175 --> 42:59.075
Uh-uh.
You got this all wrong.

42:59.844 --> 43:03.079
That girl did go missing just
a couple of towns from here.

43:03.081 --> 43:07.083
So what? That doesn't mean that she's
dead or that Peter was involved.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.285
[chuckles]

43:09.788 --> 43:10.887
You know what?

43:11.957 --> 43:13.189
You're no match for him.

43:13.191 --> 43:17.727
Okay? And if you think that's
gonna be part of the deal,

43:17.729 --> 43:20.029
you might as well forget it,
'cause that ain't gonna help you.

43:20.031 --> 43:23.700
Of course not.
Do you wanna see my black belt?

43:25.136 --> 43:26.636
That ain't gonna save you.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.237
Don't fuck with me.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.141
Don't fuck with me.

43:32.143 --> 43:36.045
I don't wanna see what happened
to your sister happen to you!

43:36.948 --> 43:39.182
You're not my goddamn father.

43:40.018 --> 43:43.786
Where were you when my parents
died in that car wreck?

43:43.788 --> 43:46.122
When I was sent
to a foster home?

43:46.124 --> 43:48.891
When I was beaten
for running away?

43:48.893 --> 43:54.130
And where the fuck were you when
I was raped by my foster brother?

43:56.101 --> 43:58.134
All right, all right.
I didn't know that.

43:58.136 --> 44:01.938
Of course.
You had your life.

44:02.774 --> 44:05.208
You had no reason
to care what happened to me.

44:06.077 --> 44:09.345
My life was over.

44:10.415 --> 44:14.817
That bastard took it from me,
and I'm gonna repay him in spades.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.052
Wanna go to jail?

44:17.922 --> 44:19.188
I'm not going to jail.

44:32.237 --> 44:34.103
So, I hear you have
a secret.

44:35.974 --> 44:37.273
Maybe I do.

44:37.876 --> 44:39.208
Did your mom find out?

44:39.210 --> 44:42.445
Yup. By the way,
I need you to cover for me.

44:42.947 --> 44:45.448
Of course, but what exactly
am I covering for?

44:45.450 --> 44:46.883
I told her I went with you.

44:47.218 --> 44:50.119
You shit.
What if she asks to see mine?

44:50.121 --> 44:53.690
Well, you can just tell her
it's on your secret place.

44:53.692 --> 44:57.293
Oh, my God.
So, how did she find out anyway?

44:58.096 --> 44:59.762
- I showed her.
- No shit.

45:00.031 --> 45:03.199
Wait, wait. Where did you--

45:03.201 --> 45:04.901
Oh, no, no, no. Look.

45:05.837 --> 45:07.170
Got it right...

45:08.940 --> 45:10.039
here.

45:10.341 --> 45:12.108
Wow, can I touch it?

45:12.110 --> 45:16.479
Ew, no. O-M-G. You let some
dirtbag inker see your tits?

45:16.481 --> 45:17.880
I mean, not completely.

45:17.882 --> 45:19.015
Did it hurt?

45:19.017 --> 45:20.316
Like a ton.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.285
- Mmm-hmm.
- I bet it did, you little bitch.

45:22.787 --> 45:24.787
I wanna get one, too.
Will you take me?

45:24.789 --> 45:26.122
Yeah, me, too.

45:26.124 --> 45:27.824
[whistle blows]

45:27.826 --> 45:30.226
I need more motivation.
I need more spirit.

45:30.228 --> 45:33.396
If I don't get that, some of you are gonna
be out on your butts. Do you hear me?

45:33.398 --> 45:34.931
- [all] Yes!
- One!

45:34.933 --> 45:36.065
[all] One!

45:36.201 --> 45:37.834
- [coach] Two!
- [all] Two!

45:37.836 --> 45:39.202
- Three!
- Three!

45:39.204 --> 45:41.337
[coach] That sucks!
One more time. Go!

45:41.339 --> 45:43.139
[whistle blows]

45:43.975 --> 45:45.408
- [coach] One!
- [all] One!

45:45.410 --> 45:46.476
- [coach] Two!
- [all] Two!

45:46.478 --> 45:47.744
[camera clicks]

45:47.746 --> 45:48.978
- Three!
- Three!

45:49.781 --> 45:51.347
- One!
- One!

45:51.349 --> 45:53.282
- Two!
- Two!

45:53.284 --> 45:54.751
- Three!
- Three!

45:55.353 --> 45:57.086
[counts continue]

46:09.534 --> 46:10.933
[sighs]

46:15.373 --> 46:16.773
Filling up, huh?

46:20.178 --> 46:21.544
Cigarette?

46:21.546 --> 46:26.115
Detective, I wouldn't expect you
to so flagrantly break the law.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.518
Well, in your case,
I make an exception.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.254
Because I'd like to see you
go up in flames.

46:32.123 --> 46:35.024
Tsk, tsk. Such anger.

46:35.026 --> 46:37.026
Yeah, stress.
It's a killer.

46:40.899 --> 46:43.833
I guess you're gonna tell me you're
a model citizen now. Is that it?

46:46.037 --> 46:48.304
Oh, Detective,
I'm a reformed man.

46:51.075 --> 46:53.876
Well, you should cut the shit,
'cause it's not gonna fly with Monica.

46:53.878 --> 46:54.977
- She has a--
- Who?

46:58.183 --> 46:59.282
Forget it.

47:01.352 --> 47:03.052
Anyway, if you'll excuse me.

47:05.190 --> 47:07.557
[pump rattles]

47:08.293 --> 47:11.294
I promised myself I'd go
bird-watching with a new friend.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.366
[engine starts]

47:21.940 --> 47:24.040
Oh. Did I come
at a bad time?

47:24.442 --> 47:26.475
No. No, not at all.

47:27.078 --> 47:28.244
'Cause if you're busy,
I can--

47:28.246 --> 47:30.546
No, really. Come in.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.350
You...

47:34.352 --> 47:35.451
Yes?

47:38.456 --> 47:40.456
Uh, I like your...

47:42.060 --> 47:43.159
The shoes, they're nice.

47:44.295 --> 47:45.628
I like them very much.

47:46.998 --> 47:48.164
The bows.

47:49.334 --> 47:51.367
That's so sweet of you.

47:51.536 --> 47:55.071
Maybe you'd like to show me around
your house, and... I don't know,

47:55.073 --> 47:58.040
free associate on your memories
from when you used to live here?

47:59.110 --> 48:01.143
- What's in that room?
- I never go in that room.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.247
Uncle Charles never let me...

48:05.583 --> 48:07.450
in there.

48:07.452 --> 48:09.485
He said there are things in
there that could hurt a person.

48:10.889 --> 48:11.954
Um...

48:12.490 --> 48:14.023
I can show you upstairs.

48:14.492 --> 48:15.925
Was this your room?

48:16.394 --> 48:17.493
No.

48:32.043 --> 48:33.142
[chuckles]

48:34.245 --> 48:36.078
Do you actually use it?
Yes.

48:37.949 --> 48:39.348
For?
Therapy.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.519
Huh.

48:44.222 --> 48:46.355
Anything you care
to share with me?

48:47.392 --> 48:48.925
Oh.

48:48.927 --> 48:50.526
For the book, I mean.
No. Maybe... I just...

48:51.996 --> 48:53.496
I'm not very spontaneous.

49:01.472 --> 49:03.272
It... It squeaked.

49:07.545 --> 49:09.211
[woman whispering] <i> Touch her.</i>

49:28.266 --> 49:29.565
Did something happen in here?

49:30.635 --> 49:32.301
Would you like some tea?

49:34.505 --> 49:36.072
[water running]

49:41.179 --> 49:42.979
The house is starting
to take shape.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.247
Sort of.

49:48.653 --> 49:49.752
You don't agree?

49:52.991 --> 49:56.192
We'll need some marmalade
for the toast. I made some.

50:00.264 --> 50:01.430
[door opens]

50:01.432 --> 50:03.032
[footsteps thudding]

50:14.512 --> 50:16.078
[whimpering]

50:18.483 --> 50:19.615
[muffled scream]

50:20.385 --> 50:21.584
[faint scream]

50:30.595 --> 50:32.361
[muffled groans]

50:33.264 --> 50:34.563
[sobbing]

50:45.676 --> 50:47.143
[footsteps]

50:49.680 --> 50:50.780
I'm okay.

50:54.052 --> 50:55.484
What was that noise?

50:56.554 --> 50:57.720
Mice.

51:14.238 --> 51:17.106
How would you describe your
relationship with Dr. Bauer?

51:17.842 --> 51:19.408
Well, she's my therapist.

51:20.344 --> 51:21.710
She cured me.

51:23.514 --> 51:26.449
How long did it take you
to eventually open up to her?

51:30.455 --> 51:31.587
[beeps]

51:34.092 --> 51:35.491
Are you afraid of me?

51:38.362 --> 51:39.462
Should I be?

51:50.374 --> 51:53.275
Did you confide in Dr. Bauer
about your first time?

51:53.277 --> 51:54.710
[sobs echoing]

51:55.713 --> 51:57.379
Did you know
that you can get cancer

51:57.381 --> 51:59.782
from breathing someone else's
cigarette smoke?

51:59.784 --> 52:03.886
[sobbing] Please let me go.
I wanna go home.

52:05.356 --> 52:09.358
My uncle loved me.
He said I was beautiful.

52:10.394 --> 52:11.894
What do you want from me?

52:13.397 --> 52:15.231
[gasping]

52:15.600 --> 52:17.233
[restraints rattling]

52:24.175 --> 52:25.708
We're ready.

52:25.710 --> 52:28.677
No, please. Ready for what?
What are you gonna do to me?

52:28.679 --> 52:30.579
[hyperventilating]

52:32.283 --> 52:34.283
Do you wanna play
rock, paper, scissors?

52:34.919 --> 52:36.318
It's my favorite.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.154
If I win, will you let me go?

52:39.724 --> 52:41.423
My uncle taught me.

52:42.627 --> 52:44.560
He always won.

52:46.597 --> 52:48.397
Then he would take his prize.

52:50.268 --> 52:51.667
Do you think
that he cheated?

52:52.737 --> 52:54.270
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

52:54.272 --> 52:56.939
No. He never did.

52:58.342 --> 53:01.777
He was a great man.
He was a great man.

53:04.916 --> 53:06.348
[gasps]

53:08.286 --> 53:09.385
Ready to play?

53:09.387 --> 53:11.520
[crying]

53:13.624 --> 53:14.757
One...

53:16.594 --> 53:17.826
two...

53:18.596 --> 53:19.795
[sobbing]

53:23.334 --> 53:24.433
...three...

53:25.336 --> 53:26.435
go.

53:27.705 --> 53:28.971
[crying]

53:30.875 --> 53:35.511
Paper covers rock.
You're not very good at this, are you?

53:35.846 --> 53:37.780
No, no. I forgot.

53:37.782 --> 53:40.416
I haven't played in a really long time.
Can we try again, please?

53:40.418 --> 53:41.717
That's too bad.

53:41.719 --> 53:42.952
What?

53:43.354 --> 53:45.254
[screams]

53:45.256 --> 53:47.356
[wailing]

53:49.427 --> 53:50.626
[gasping]

53:53.731 --> 53:55.331
Where did you just go?

53:56.234 --> 53:59.835
Where do memories go when
you aren't remembering them?

54:01.906 --> 54:03.005
Both?

54:07.745 --> 54:09.678
Peter, you can trust me.

54:15.353 --> 54:17.519
I've never told
anyone else this...

54:19.890 --> 54:22.024
but I have my own scars.

54:23.427 --> 54:26.829
My pain reaches down
on my soul.

54:27.765 --> 54:31.934
And down there are secrets
I carry like a cross.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.010
I think our work
is done today.

54:43.581 --> 54:45.314
<i>Peter's log. Day eight.</i>

54:46.317 --> 54:47.916
<i>She pushes me to...</i>

54:49.020 --> 54:51.920
<i>confess, to reveal, to...</i>

54:53.724 --> 54:54.923
<i>to trust.</i>

54:58.629 --> 54:59.728
<i>I want...</i>

55:00.998 --> 55:02.698
<i>I can't. I...</i>

55:03.834 --> 55:05.768
<i>If I tell her,
there's no going back.</i>

55:07.972 --> 55:09.071
<i>Yet, I...</i>

55:09.974 --> 55:11.540
<i>I feel...</i>

55:15.379 --> 55:17.946
<i>I sense something
familiar in her.</i>

55:19.984 --> 55:22.751
<i>What? No.</i>

55:24.088 --> 55:25.654
<i>It's for my doctor.</i>

55:26.457 --> 55:29.558
<i>No, I don't want to! No!</i>

55:29.960 --> 55:32.428
<i>I'm not going back!</i>

55:33.764 --> 55:35.097
<i>No! Stop it!</i>

55:35.099 --> 55:36.865
[scuffling]

55:43.374 --> 55:44.807
[laughs]

55:46.344 --> 55:48.377
[gasping]

55:53.984 --> 55:54.933
<i>Boo.</i>

55:54.934 --> 55:55.883
What kind of birds
are you hoping to house?

55:57.455 --> 55:58.787
Any kind, really.

56:01.359 --> 56:02.958
That is a very long pole.

56:03.594 --> 56:04.693
Squirrels.

56:09.734 --> 56:12.468
I'm sorry. I thought you
said this was a birdhouse.

56:14.004 --> 56:15.537
To keep squirrels out.

56:19.543 --> 56:21.009
I'm so sorry.

56:23.781 --> 56:26.081
I didn't mean to scare you
last night.

56:26.684 --> 56:29.785
No, it was my fault.
I was pressing way too hard.

56:30.788 --> 56:32.488
I was bothered.

56:32.923 --> 56:35.824
I asked you about
the first time you ever...

56:37.728 --> 56:39.061
hurt a girl.

56:46.404 --> 56:47.703
I can tell you that...

56:47.705 --> 56:53.876
no matter what I did or didn't
do, they would always tell on me.

56:57.148 --> 56:58.647
And then he would pour...

56:58.649 --> 57:04.686
My uncle would pour boiling water
down there because I was a nasty boy.

57:04.688 --> 57:07.423
A nasty, nasty boy.

57:11.962 --> 57:13.195
Then we'd play our game.

57:13.531 --> 57:14.930
Rock, paper...

57:15.065 --> 57:16.131
Mmm-hmm.

57:16.133 --> 57:17.933
But he always won.

57:19.970 --> 57:21.069
Always.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.673
[woman]
<i>Tell her my name.</i>

57:25.743 --> 57:26.909
<i>Tell her Barbara's here.</i>

57:29.046 --> 57:30.979
<i>Say it!</i>

57:32.216 --> 57:33.549
Barbara.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.119
I've changed.

57:37.521 --> 57:38.620
I know.

57:38.789 --> 57:39.888
No, you don't.

57:40.491 --> 57:43.659
[stammering] I believe...
I trust you.

57:48.699 --> 57:49.748
Do you?

57:49.749 --> 57:50.798
I just wanna fiddle
a little bit. Fiddle.

57:52.002 --> 57:55.237
And touch and look.

57:59.944 --> 58:01.477
[woman]
<i>You can't change.</i>

58:02.913 --> 58:04.112
The other part.

58:05.115 --> 58:06.248
Killing?

58:07.685 --> 58:08.851
Came later.

58:12.690 --> 58:14.857
No one could ever know.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.160
What... Who...

58:23.834 --> 58:26.602
Would you take off all your clothes
and let me do anything I want?

58:29.807 --> 58:30.906
Will you?

58:32.610 --> 58:36.245
Promise not to call me
a nasty boy? Not tell anyone?

58:37.781 --> 58:38.914
Ever?

58:41.118 --> 58:42.251
[gasping]

58:46.090 --> 58:47.656
[breathing deeply]

58:55.032 --> 58:56.198
[gasping]

58:59.169 --> 59:01.003
[laughing]

59:01.004 --> 59:02.838
It's not so easy
to wash your sins away, is it?

59:03.641 --> 59:08.010
I can't...
I can't let her see.

59:09.013 --> 59:11.847
Oh, Peter, you can't hide
the truth from her.

59:11.849 --> 59:14.249
She will find out.

59:14.251 --> 59:16.718
No. Shut up!

59:20.257 --> 59:21.957
[panting]

59:44.882 --> 59:46.348
[gasps]

59:46.350 --> 59:49.151
You left your door ajar.
You should be more careful.

59:50.054 --> 59:52.688
Well, you should've knocked
or something.

59:54.224 --> 59:55.691
Are you going somewhere?

59:55.993 --> 59:57.159
Um...

59:57.161 --> 01:00:00.862
I was just rearranging
some of my--

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:01.964
Here.

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:04.800
You seem to like them.

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.301
They're lovely.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:07.869
[chuckles]

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.237
Wow.

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:16.044
Would you have dinner
with me?

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:21.016
I'd like...
to make you dinner.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:25.787
I'll tell you everything
you want to know for your book,

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.690
for our book.

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.192
In an hour?

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:31.960
Um...

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.663
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:36.698
[chuckles]

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:42.170
I'm sorry if I scared you.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:43.905
It's okay.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.183
[woman] <i> Stop.</i>

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.253
<i>You'll lose everything.</i>

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:06.795
[police radio chatter]

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:10.032
Morning. I'm glad you
could make it so quickly.

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:12.734
It's not like I have a
challenging schedule these days.

01:01:12.736 --> 01:01:14.670
Right now
that sounds very enticing.

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:16.872
This is my partner,
Detective Flynn.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.241
We know each other.
Yeah, we do.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.677
[indistinct chatter]

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.715
[woman] Obviously,
this is ritualistic.

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:29.785
Does that tattoo
mean anything to you?

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:37.025
Ah, it's only
a couple of days old.

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.195
Anybody notify
the Marquez family?

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.465
Why would we do that?
This isn't the Marquez girl.

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:45.133
Well, who phoned it in?

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:46.868
Male voice.
Said he was out bird-watching and--

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.704
Son of a bitch.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.341
Just in time.

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:57.212
I'm sorry.
I didn't dress up.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:01:59.448
Won't you come in?

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:10.392
[chuckles]

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:11.493
Thank you.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.865
You really have been busy.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.767
Would you like some of this?

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:26.975
That's fine. Thank you.

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:36.518
I will answer
all your questions.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.322
Even the really
difficult ones.

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.831
[crockery clanking]

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.012
You didn't care
for the champagne?

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:06.181
I didn't wanna start
without you.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.493
Do you hate women?

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:54.429
Oh, no. Quite the opposite.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.167
I love them far too much.

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:18.286
Do you think it was possible
to find a woman who actually

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:22.524
liked what you wanted
to do with her?

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.460
Aside from the killing part.

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:28.563
I don't think--

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:32.500
What made you choose
one woman over another?

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:39.007
Dr. Bauer explained that I might
have been drawn to some kind of...

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:42.410
weakness in them.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:47.048
Weakness.

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:53.121
So, Dr. Bauer said
it was their fault?

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:55.090
Not in so many words.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:58.393
Are you sure
you didn't misunderstand her?

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:06.635
[cutlery clatters]

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:08.169
I have something for you.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.173
[singing echoing]

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:49.978
When I was
in the grip of my...

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:56.384
my sickness,
I would wear that.

01:05:57.721 --> 01:05:59.020
Why?

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:04.626
Made me feel... safe.

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.162
Why?

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:09.464
Don't remember.

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:11.533
You must.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:23.511
Were you wearing this when
you killed your last victim,

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.613
Angela Grant?

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:28.984
Oh, she was special.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:32.253
Were you being nasty
with her?

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:38.777
Yes.

01:06:38.778 --> 01:06:40.528
At first, it was just enough to...
peek...

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:43.999
to look.

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:47.535
But then...

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.175
I had to touch.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:07:01.116
Did she lose to you when you
made her play your game, Peter?

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:04.619
Because you don't play fair,
do you?

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:06.688
You're a cheater.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:08.790
Thought that
you would be different.

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.414
[choking]

01:07:16.415 --> 01:07:18.665
Did you kill her when she
could've saved her life? Rock?

[singing echoing]

- [door opens]
- [grunting]

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:39.454
Is this how it feels?

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:41.689
[whimpering]
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:45.060
[stammering] I don't wanna...

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:49.164
What? Who, me?
I'm just finishing the book.

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.166
I don't understand.

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:54.235
Sure you do.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.504
No, no, this is wrong.

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:58.239
Oh, yes, it is.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:07:59.374
[laughs]

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:03.345
No, it isn't.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:04.379
I should've known
why I was drawn to you.

01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:07.849
You're just like me.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:09.584
[scoffs]

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.252
You wish!

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:17.258
Let me help you wrap your
pea-sized brain around this deal.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.127
Your last kill...

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:22.497
was my sister.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:26.600
She was my everything.

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.269
No.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:31.639
And you didn't give a shit.

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:33.841
Well, I...

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.345
I don't give a shit.
No.

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:39.113
[whimpers]

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:41.116
Please.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:44.352
Please, please, please.
I'm cured. I'm cured.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.187
Hardly, Petey.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:50.758
[gasps] Let's play a game.
Maybe my luck will change.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:53.560
- Ready?
- [knocking]

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:55.763
Help--
Shh!

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:57.365
Shh!

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:01.368
[muffled whimpers]

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.707
Now, don't you go anywhere.

01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:10.178
Yes?

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:16.350
I'm looking for my patient, Peter Harris.
And who are you, Miss...

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:18.286
Monica Barfield.
I'm the housekeeper.

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.555
I'm sorry, Mr. Harris
is out for the evening.

01:09:20.557 --> 01:09:23.191
Funny. He didn't tell me
that he hired a housekeeper.

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:24.526
Today's my first day, ma'am.

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:26.294
Today is your first day?

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:29.363
You know, I've had a long drive,
and I don't mind waiting.

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:33.801
Mr. Harris gave me strict instructions,
no visitors. So, I'm sorry.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:37.572
Well, I am his psychotherapist,
and I really need to see him now.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.408
I'm sorry. He said no visitors.
Please leave.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:41.709
- I'm gonna go see him--
- You're gonna...

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:44.779
[muffled screaming]

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:48.649
Peter! I need this job. Please.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:50.652
Peter.
Please. Out of here.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:52.287
I can't have you
in the house.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.727
The two of you just ate
together, didn't you?

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:01.663
Yes, but he left
right afterwards

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:03.932
with instructions
not to let anyone in here.

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.467
Hmm.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.977
Is that the door
to the basement?

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:19.480
Look, Peter told me
not to have anyone in here.

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:24.953
You know what he did to
those poor women down there?

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:26.321
Those poor--

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:29.290
Last time.
I'm calling the police.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:35.496
All right. But it is imperative that you
ask Peter to call me when he gets back.

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:43.504
[phone ringing]

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:48.977
This is Dr. Bauer.

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.248
Oh, my God.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:56.384
I'm standing out in front
of his house right now.

01:10:58.288 --> 01:10:59.487
[grunting]

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:01.256
I was wrong about Peter.

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:03.891
You need to hurry.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:06.894
[panting]

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:08.896
[groans]

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:10.965
Uh-uh-uh!

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:15.403
Rock...

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:17.272
paper...

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:19.340
dead.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.410
I choose scissors.

01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:25.046
Well, carving knife.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:31.019
Did my sister beg for her life?
[gasping]

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.854
[groaning]

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.425
[stammering]
But I love you.

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:40.862
[chuckles]

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:42.329
- Not good enough.
- I thought you loved me, too.

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:44.399
Does this look like love?

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.801
[screaming]

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:53.374
You can dish it out, but you sure
as fuck can't take it, can you?

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:54.809
[whimpers]

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:57.512
I didn't do it.
It wasn't me.

01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:00.982
Aaron.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:03.818
Aaron, Aaron.

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:07.455
Aaron made me do it.

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:11.759
He doesn't exist.
No.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.562
He never did.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.332
Good-bye, Peter.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:21.836
- I can't allow that.
- [gasping]

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:25.406
Peter, you said
he doesn't exist!

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.442
Oh, I'm very real, Ashley.

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:29.777
And for the record,
he was telling the truth.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.547
I chose all the girls.

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:36.384
It was all so easy.
After all, I died as a baby.

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:38.386
- If I didn't exist...
- Aaron?

01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:40.555
...how could I be punished?

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:42.423
[whimpering]

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:45.827
And here's one more tidbit
for you to swallow.

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:49.864
Your sister
didn't die a virgin.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.599
[both groan]

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:53.835
[grunts]

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:00.675
[groaning]

01:13:00.844 --> 01:13:02.510
[roars]

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.145
[panting]

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:07.849
I dead-bolted the doors.
Don't just lie there. Go get her!

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:13.454
[rattling]

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:17.892
Hurry up.
You always take so long.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:22.029
Stop whining. I already told
you, I dead-bolted the doors.

01:13:26.803 --> 01:13:28.936
I didn't realize
we had any more of these.

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:31.472
Let's have some fun.

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:36.744
Boo.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.531
[breathes heavily]

01:13:59.469 --> 01:14:02.804
Go. Go quickly.
Don't suffer my fate.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.539
I have to end this.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.441
You're not real.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:11.045
Oh, you're quite the spitfire.

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:13.181
Oh, you have no idea.

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:16.784
I kicked Peter senseless,
and I can do the same to you.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:20.688
[both grunting]

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:28.196
[screams]

01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:30.965
[grunting]

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:34.702
[panting]

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.105
Hey!

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:39.707
Catch.

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.709
[groans]

01:14:54.257 --> 01:14:55.623
[roars]

01:15:21.918 --> 01:15:23.017
Oh, fuck!

01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:29.290
[groans]

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.302
I thought that
you'd be different.

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:45.673
But you're just like
all the rest.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.943
You're just...

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:52.847
like all the rest.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:10.865
What have you done now?

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.033
It's my birthday.

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:14.735
Stay away!

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:17.338
Come show your Uncle Charles
how much you love him.

01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:19.807
[chuckles]

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:21.676
Do you still have that little
dress I bought for you?

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:22.877
No!

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.146
I'm not a little girl.
I'm not a little girl.

01:16:25.148 --> 01:16:27.114
I'm a boy. I'm a boy!

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.816
[cackling]

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:30.918
I'm a boy.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.688
- [manic laughter]
- I'm a boy. I'm a boy. No!

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:35.856
No. Stay away.

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:37.658
[grunting]

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:43.130
[screaming]

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:04.352
[Doyle]
Oh, my God. It's over.

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:07.254
[chuckles]

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:08.689
Didn't think
I'd live to see that.

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:11.192
He will.
He's gonna get away.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:12.860
- He could get away.
- Who?

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:14.261
He's down in the study.
Aaron.

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:15.396
[Doyle] Who?

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:16.697
[Ashley] Aaron!

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:33.681
He's gone.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.118
Don't you see?

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:40.054
I was almost free.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:43.290
Now she'll never leave me alone.

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:49.830
Angela. My sister.

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:01.242
So, let me guess.

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:04.979
She thinks Harris' twin
brother was a real person.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:07.982
Now she's talking
to her own dead sister,

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:10.851
which makes her
as crazy as he was.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:14.355
[Dr. Bauer] I think she has been trying
to kill Peter her whole entire life,

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.390
and now she has nothing.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:17.692
Yeah.

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:19.960
- Is she ever gonna snap out of it?
- [phone rings]

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:21.095
Excuse me one second.

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:23.364
This is Dr. Bauer.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.199
Excuse me?

01:18:25.435 --> 01:18:27.201
<i>Okay. I'll be right down.
Thank you.</i>

01:18:29.172 --> 01:18:31.472
Dr. Bauer will be right down
to sign the release.

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:33.274
There's a waiting area
right down the hall if you--

01:18:33.276 --> 01:18:35.409
Oh, that's okay.
I'll check on the patient myself.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:39.146
- What room did you say she was in again?
- I didn't.

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:40.314
That's odd.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.317
Sir, sir. You can't--
Sir, you have to wait!

01:18:43.319 --> 01:18:44.719
[gasping]

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:50.491

Oh, my God!

[footsteps]

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.845
Oh, my God.
Okay.

01:19:11.481 --> 01:19:13.280
I'm gonna call 911.
Okay.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:15.049
Okay, I'm going to the...

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:22.823
Hey!

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:24.925
Hey!

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:28.028
Hey.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:30.498
You're not allowed to take...

01:19:31.834 --> 01:19:32.867
[groans]

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:38.506
No!

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:40.841
- [panting]
- [engine starts]

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:47.281
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:49.850
- Motherfucker!
- Dr. Bauer!

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:51.452
[all murmuring]

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:03.531
[Aaron] Mommy dropped us off
with Uncle Charles.

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:05.399
[Ashley whimpering]

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.401
He didn't want me.

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:12.306
She dropped me off with Social
Services, never to be seen again.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:19.146
Uncle Charles was abusing Peter,
so I fixed him for good.

01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:22.316
After that, it was just
my brother and me.

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:26.086
And we made damn sure
no one ever saw us together.

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:30.090
Pretty cool, huh?

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:34.061
Then we began to play
our little game.

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:36.463
Rock, paper...

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.133
dead.

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:44.271
I picked the victims,
but Peter killed them.

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:48.542
I guess it was the only way
he could get any satisfaction.

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:53.948
Sick fuck.
