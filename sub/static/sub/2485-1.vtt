01:08.074 --> 01:09.651
Perfect.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.941
Promise you'll turn me on like this
on your 70th birthday?

01:16.041 --> 01:19.040
- Promise.
- Yeah?

01:19.474 --> 01:23.774
- Happy birthday, Katie-cakes.
- Thank you.

01:23.874 --> 01:26.506
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yep.

01:50.172 --> 01:53.472
Yep, I'm gonna see you on Tuesday.
The fabric is perfect.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.805
I picked out something
very special for you.

01:56.905 --> 01:59.195
Okay. Bye. I'll see you then.

02:20.672 --> 02:23.006
Look at you,
working all hard over here.

02:23.106 --> 02:24.705
Don't even think about it.

02:24.805 --> 02:26.805
You should have let me
take you out tonight.

02:26.905 --> 02:29.372
Come on, you know I love
this kind of thing.

02:29.472 --> 02:31.341
Yeah.

02:33.271 --> 02:35.371
- Hey, let me grab it.
- No, I got it. It's okay.

02:35.471 --> 02:37.071
- Get the towel.
- Get outta here.

02:37.171 --> 02:39.462
- Alright. Alright.
- Go.

02:44.504 --> 02:46.905
Oh, my God. Look at your body
in that dress.

02:47.005 --> 02:50.270
- I look like an unmade bed.
- Scallop canapes? Seriously?

02:50.370 --> 02:52.603
- It's nothing. Here.
- Oh, you always say that.

02:52.703 --> 02:54.270
- Oh, please.
- And then you say that.

02:54.370 --> 02:55.770
Oh, plea...

02:55.870 --> 02:59.703
- At UT, she turned me down three times.
- It took him two years to notice me.

02:59.803 --> 03:03.304
- So what finally sealed the deal?
- That's none of your damn business.

03:04.104 --> 03:05.670
- Go ahead and tell 'em.
- You tell 'em.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.637
No, no, you tell 'em.

03:07.737 --> 03:10.736
When Bill and I were dating,
he told me I looked good drunk.

03:10.836 --> 03:11.970
Is it better than that?

03:12.070 --> 03:16.865
He said, "I like me better
when I'm with you."

03:17.537 --> 03:19.350
To Kate...

03:19.792 --> 03:21.944
my gorgeous wife, on her 35th birthday.

03:22.044 --> 03:24.457
- Evan, please.
- When I saw you 15 years ago,

03:24.557 --> 03:28.967
I said to myself, "There's a girl that
I need to know." And look at you now...

03:29.609 --> 03:30.875
even more amazing.

03:32.301 --> 03:35.103
Happy birthday, Kate. 15 straight.

03:35.203 --> 03:37.869
And we're just getting started.

03:40.649 --> 03:42.119
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:42.219 --> 03:44.253
What is this?

03:48.135 --> 03:49.802
What's wrong?

03:49.902 --> 03:53.202
You know, it's... it's beautiful,
and I love you so much,

03:53.302 --> 03:55.102
but I just have to say something.

03:55.202 --> 03:58.800
You guys are royally screwed.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.635
Can't help it. Your piano's out of tune.

04:05.735 --> 04:07.501
Don't listen to them, Bill.
You sound great.

04:07.601 --> 04:09.945
- Thank you. Hey, care to join me?
- Oh, God, no.

04:10.045 --> 04:14.134
Come on, Kate.
I haven't heard you play in years.

04:14.234 --> 04:15.768
Get him off the piano.

04:15.868 --> 04:18.635
- I can't even play Chopsticks now.
- It's not even a choice.

04:51.034 --> 04:52.828
That's a first.

05:30.069 --> 05:32.841
Oh, shit.

05:40.431 --> 05:42.545
Shit.

05:50.264 --> 05:53.398
Shit! Shit! Shit!

05:53.498 --> 05:55.997
Hey, you! Out! Now!

05:56.097 --> 05:58.897
- You wanna go again?
- No. No going again.

05:58.997 --> 06:02.114
- That's not what you said last night.
- Out, now.

06:03.518 --> 06:05.628
- Well, I remember your name.
- Goody.

06:05.728 --> 06:07.698
- Shit!
- Bec.

06:08.297 --> 06:11.031
Nobody calls you Rebecca,
except your old lady.

06:11.131 --> 06:13.031
She's on at you for being
a fifth-year senior.

06:13.131 --> 06:17.467
- Please put your pants on.
- After switching majors six times in three years.

06:18.298 --> 06:20.932
- Pants! Now!
- Alright.

06:43.096 --> 06:45.375
You're with your friends.

06:52.008 --> 06:55.817
We don't have to do the whole
number exchange thing, right?

06:56.331 --> 06:58.788
Right. I think I love you!

08:07.227 --> 08:10.294
I know you gotta go.
You know what, let me finish.

08:10.394 --> 08:11.927
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:13.422 --> 08:15.793
Look, I got this down
to a science, honey.

08:15.893 --> 08:17.894
I gotta go to work
in 40 minutes. Just let me...

08:17.994 --> 08:20.352
I can do it. Just give me a minute.

08:22.481 --> 08:25.673
Look, I know
that it's important to you.

08:26.227 --> 08:31.190
Just let me finish it. Okay?
There you go.

08:31.294 --> 08:33.293
Did Mrs. Trotter say
she was gonna be late?

08:33.793 --> 08:35.159
She's not coming.

08:36.315 --> 08:40.293
What do you mean?
As in all day she's not coming?

08:40.393 --> 08:43.659
- As in I let her go.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What?

08:43.760 --> 08:47.426
She made me feel like a patient.
I'm not a patient.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.993
Kate. Kate. Katie, listen.

08:50.093 --> 08:52.859
We finally found somebody
who was efficient.

08:52.959 --> 08:56.726
Somebody who I can trust. Somebody who
can be flexible when I'm running late.

08:56.826 --> 09:00.759
You can't just be making
these decisions without...

09:01.392 --> 09:06.122
- Let me call Miles.
- I'm interviewing for a replacement. Okay?

09:09.625 --> 09:11.092
Okay, this is crazy.

09:11.192 --> 09:13.459
- I'm interviewing...
- Right now?

09:13.559 --> 09:16.492
- You're interviewing for a replacement?
- Go to work and I'll interview her.

09:16.592 --> 09:18.791
Right now?
You're interviewing right now?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.013
Let me interview her,

09:21.113 --> 09:23.000
- and the you can meet her later.
- No, no. No, I don't...

09:23.100 --> 09:25.968
- It's okay.
- We'll interview her together.

09:36.658 --> 09:37.791
Oops.

09:39.539 --> 09:43.786
I'm Bec... Cartwell.
I'm here for the job interview.

09:50.394 --> 09:52.464
Thank you.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.091
So... which one of you plays piano?

09:59.191 --> 10:02.552
- I do. Did.
- Why'd you give it up?

10:04.472 --> 10:07.124
- Right.
- I assume you brought a CV?

10:09.348 --> 10:11.182
- Resume.
- No, I brought a resume.

10:11.282 --> 10:15.153
I found Bec on the university website.

10:17.229 --> 10:19.122
It says your most recent
place of employment

10:19.222 --> 10:22.812
was the Red Lobster
on the Sam Houston Tollway?

10:22.912 --> 10:25.524
Wait. Sorry. Wrong one.

10:25.624 --> 10:27.523
Yeah. It's a...

10:27.623 --> 10:31.122
little different than the one
I put in the email.

10:31.222 --> 10:33.423
I kinda padded that one.

10:33.523 --> 10:37.523
So, who was taking care of you before?
If you don't mind my asking.

10:37.623 --> 10:41.988
Not at all. We had
a lovely woman who moved on.

10:42.088 --> 10:44.155
And before that, my mother.

10:44.255 --> 10:47.222
- Wow, that takes balls.
- Yes. It wasn't perfect.

10:47.322 --> 10:50.788
If it was me and my mother,
it would have been like...

10:50.888 --> 10:52.721
braaghhh, bloodshed by lunchtime.

10:52.821 --> 10:55.922
I assume housekeeping
isn't in your skill set.

10:56.022 --> 11:00.095
Do you cook? Any nursing experience?

11:00.195 --> 11:02.855
Tell me, Bec, have you ever seen,
let alone cared for,

11:02.955 --> 11:06.172
someone suffering from a major
degenerative illness?

11:06.272 --> 11:09.755
Not really.
I've read some stuff online.

11:09.855 --> 11:12.155
You read some stuff online.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.156
Okay, well, it was nice to meet you.
I'm sure you're very bright.

11:15.256 --> 11:18.579
What did you mean by "not really"?

11:23.189 --> 11:28.425
Back in high school, I volunteered
at a nursing home in Tyler.

11:28.525 --> 11:32.295
They stuck my Grammy Jones
in there and I was there a lot.

11:32.395 --> 11:35.075
I didn't put it down
'cause it was a while ago.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.953
You got your broccoli,
you got your beets.

11:41.053 --> 11:44.220
- Evan, you're gonna be late.
- Carrots. Got your chopping board.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.520
You got your knife. After you chop...

11:47.620 --> 11:49.553
- Evan, I can show her.
- Hold on.

11:49.653 --> 11:52.220
You add your vitamins...

11:52.971 --> 11:55.210
and your immuno-boosts.

11:55.310 --> 11:58.420
Alright? We wanna keep as many
calories in her as we can.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.519
- Low fat is the enemy...
- Can I talk to you?

12:00.619 --> 12:03.450
- Just give me a second to...
- Please.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.420
Bathroom?

12:05.520 --> 12:07.387
- Yeah, it's straight back over there.
- It's that way.

12:07.487 --> 12:08.454
Sorry.

12:09.253 --> 12:11.452
Alright, this woman is a nightmare.

12:11.552 --> 12:13.987
She's not a nurse. How can I trust
that you're gonna be okay with her?

12:14.087 --> 12:16.553
Maybe she'll actually
listen to me, okay?

12:16.653 --> 12:18.653
Look, will you please just
let me take care of this?

12:18.753 --> 12:22.277
I promise you I'll make it work. Okay?

12:23.104 --> 12:24.125
Okay?

12:24.225 --> 12:26.661
Bec. Bec, could you please
cut on the cutting board?

12:26.761 --> 12:28.886
Oh, cool.

12:28.986 --> 12:33.601
So... ALS patients live, like, what...
two to five years?

12:33.919 --> 12:35.186
How long you been sick?

12:35.286 --> 12:39.985
You don't put the broccoli stems
in the blender. Just the flower heads.

12:40.085 --> 12:43.784
Don't worry, I'm not trying to calculate
when I'm gonna need to get another gig.

12:43.884 --> 12:46.617
Just curious where you are
on the timeline.

12:46.717 --> 12:49.899
- A year and a half.
- That's what gets me about this disease.

12:49.999 --> 12:53.452
Your mind stays so fuckin' sharp,
while your arms and your legs...

12:53.951 --> 12:55.418
Oh, no!

12:55.518 --> 12:57.519
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

12:59.312 --> 13:03.744
Okay. First time for everything.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.238
Okay, cool.

13:06.338 --> 13:09.968
Hey, no rush.
I'm just gonna be... right here.

13:10.068 --> 13:12.519
- Just take your time.
- Bec, I'm going to need some help.

13:15.113 --> 13:17.138
Getting on. And...

13:17.238 --> 13:21.000
I'll need some assistance after...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.168
wiping.

13:24.479 --> 13:26.185
What's funny?

13:26.285 --> 13:30.117
It's just this thing
that my roommate Jill says.

13:30.217 --> 13:34.807
She'd rather have cats than kids, until kids
learn how to shit in a litter box.

13:35.816 --> 13:39.514
Oh, God, you're probably like a nice...

13:39.614 --> 13:41.736
no-swearing,
no-sex-on-Sunday Baptist...

13:41.836 --> 13:46.084
What I am is a grown woman
who needs help using the bathroom.

13:46.184 --> 13:50.559
Okay, I am pulling your pants down.

13:51.359 --> 13:53.114
And here go...

13:53.849 --> 13:56.783
- your underwear.
- Can you skip the commentary?

13:58.791 --> 13:59.847
Okay.

14:00.254 --> 14:02.959
Why is this thing so fucking low?

14:03.059 --> 14:05.592
Bec, your language.

14:08.383 --> 14:13.417
I am unfurling the... toilet tissue.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.183
Harder please.

14:25.283 --> 14:26.450
What?

14:27.148 --> 14:29.639
Wipe harder, please.

14:29.739 --> 14:32.107
No problem.

14:33.492 --> 14:35.023
Okay,

14:35.123 --> 14:37.545
I'm lifting you up,

14:37.915 --> 14:40.724
pulling up your pants...

14:41.024 --> 14:43.446
for you...

14:45.015 --> 14:48.130
Shit. Are you okay?

14:55.748 --> 14:57.381
That wasn't even the worst part.

14:57.481 --> 15:00.082
The worst part...
was that she didn't even get mad.

15:00.182 --> 15:04.845
Like, she just sat there
with this perfect tight smile on her face.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.847
Quiet freak out, way worse.
She needs to chill.

15:07.947 --> 15:12.912
Here's to... yet another day
of finding something new I suck at.

15:15.477 --> 15:19.867
Hey, superstar, you're up.
Please don't bomb this.

15:21.364 --> 15:22.948
- You got this, Bec.
- I got it.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.181
- You got it.
- I got it.

15:24.281 --> 15:26.048
- You got it!
- I got it!

15:26.347 --> 15:27.579
Yeah, she don't got it.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.473
Hi.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.712
I'm Bec...

16:11.812 --> 16:13.209
and...

16:13.309 --> 16:17.441
it's really cool to be here
at Dirty Barry's.

16:17.595 --> 16:20.809
And now it's just me. Okay.

16:22.218 --> 16:26.374
I'm gonna sing a song.

16:36.506 --> 16:39.077
Get off the stage!

16:40.287 --> 16:42.239
- Give me one second.
- Next!

16:55.078 --> 16:57.544
Why do I keep doing this to myself?

16:57.644 --> 17:01.936
Did you know that Janis, Elvis and Waylon
all freaked out on that very same stage?

17:04.011 --> 17:06.548
- I'm Wil, by the way.
- Why can't I just stop?

17:07.971 --> 17:10.182
Speaking of which...

17:14.477 --> 17:17.243
You do know that banging
your professor is a cliche, right?

17:17.344 --> 17:22.631
We do not bang.
We exchange ideas... naked, in bed.

17:28.843 --> 17:31.175
Is she always that...?

17:31.599 --> 17:33.463
Yeah, it's not just you, dude.

17:33.563 --> 17:36.673
- Okay.
- That's a nice work coat.

17:40.342 --> 17:42.909
I don't know why I...

17:43.009 --> 17:44.898
Thanks.

17:46.408 --> 17:48.742
The only reason
I'm not totally pissed off you're late

17:48.842 --> 17:50.542
is that I just took failure
to a whole new...

17:50.642 --> 17:54.508
- Liam, here you go.
- Bec, this is Jen, my wife.

17:54.608 --> 17:57.942
Jen, this is Bec, one of my students...
and a very good one at that.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.859
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

18:00.959 --> 18:03.675
- It's good to see you.
- I'm gonna get a drink.

18:41.284 --> 18:42.802
Sorry.

18:42.902 --> 18:44.740
Bec.

18:45.177 --> 18:46.966
Bec.

18:47.305 --> 18:49.040
Hey.

18:49.339 --> 18:52.097
Can I just borrow her
for a second there?

18:52.396 --> 18:54.726
- We're actually...
- Just a sec.

18:54.826 --> 18:58.206
- You know I'm married.
- And I have a boyfriend.

18:58.306 --> 19:01.807
So you're just gonna have
to control your feelings...

19:01.907 --> 19:03.807
every time you see me with Bill.

19:03.907 --> 19:06.454
It's "Wil", actually.

19:06.707 --> 19:09.538
Or Bill. Wil. Whatever.

19:12.007 --> 19:13.751
Here.

19:14.373 --> 19:15.774
Alright. I can drive.

19:15.874 --> 19:18.304
Guys, get off my truck.

19:18.404 --> 19:21.472
- Git. Goodnight.
- Of course you have a truck.

19:21.572 --> 19:24.189
- This is a good truck.
- Yes.

19:24.389 --> 19:26.872
I knew she wouldn't work out.

19:26.972 --> 19:28.504
I tell you what,
we'll get Mrs. Trotter back,

19:28.604 --> 19:30.715
because, honestly, baby,
she was perfect for us.

19:30.815 --> 19:35.706
She was perfect. I'm just glad that
that... What was her name?

19:35.806 --> 19:37.839
Bec. Bec Cartwell.

19:37.939 --> 19:42.514
I'm just glad that that is behind us
and we can get back to the way things were.

19:42.614 --> 19:43.624
Alright, let's go to bed.

19:53.272 --> 19:55.562
You're really hot.

20:33.603 --> 20:36.737
Oh, my God, I feel like I'm sexing
a Jackson Pollock painting.

20:37.939 --> 20:39.367
Okay.

20:52.737 --> 20:54.737
Evan?

20:56.345 --> 20:58.195
Yeah?

21:01.289 --> 21:04.083
You wake me up
if you need anything. Alright?

21:04.183 --> 21:06.000
Goodnight.

21:25.268 --> 21:29.551
- What the hell is that?
- I made you eggs.

21:30.981 --> 21:34.366
Let's get one thing
real clear, real quick.

21:34.466 --> 21:37.588
I'm not girlfriend material,
so we good?

21:37.688 --> 21:40.668
Yeah, it's good, it's good.
Great. Perfect.

21:40.768 --> 21:43.423
Lose my number, Liam.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.706
Hold on. You want me back?

21:47.802 --> 21:51.907
Yep. Yep, of course, Bec.
Love to have you back.

21:53.402 --> 21:55.285
I just witnessed a hit-and-run,
and had to wait for a cop,

21:55.385 --> 21:58.738
but I did find someone
who can deliver organic vegetables.

21:59.969 --> 22:03.833
My cat was puking like crazy.
Nice suit. Italian?

22:06.502 --> 22:09.266
We're not really interested
in your excuses.

22:09.366 --> 22:11.702
This has been going on for weeks.

22:11.802 --> 22:15.768
Evan has a very demanding schedule,
and I have a very demanding condition.

22:15.968 --> 22:19.200
- You show up late again...
- Got it. Understand.

22:23.232 --> 22:25.666
- Her charms more than allude me.
- She's young.

22:25.766 --> 22:29.578
Okay, so ladies' night. You excited?

22:29.678 --> 22:30.969
Turning backflips.

22:31.069 --> 22:33.865
Hey, these are
your best friends, alright?

22:33.965 --> 22:36.800
It's important that you
don't shut everybody out.

22:36.900 --> 22:41.033
Besides, I can't cancel on Alex again.
He's gonna think I hate him.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.566
You do hate him.

22:44.451 --> 22:48.660
I miss us just... being together.

22:50.766 --> 22:55.061
Hey, I miss that, too. Okay?

22:55.461 --> 22:58.022
I'll try to get back from dinner early,
I'll say hello to your friends,

22:58.122 --> 23:01.132
and then it'll be
just you and me, alright?

23:01.232 --> 23:04.966
Okay. Love you. Bye.

23:07.704 --> 23:09.818
So before we buy out the rest of Texas,

23:09.918 --> 23:12.766
you should probably know
I can't cook anything.

23:12.866 --> 23:14.633
Like, not even Pop-Tarts.

23:14.733 --> 23:18.166
- That's fine.
- I mean, like, at all.

23:18.766 --> 23:22.365
You don't need to know how to cook.
You just need to know how to listen.

23:22.665 --> 23:24.729
Alyssa, you look so good
I almost hate you.

23:24.829 --> 23:27.165
- Oh, shut up.
- Especially after just having a baby.

23:27.265 --> 23:29.565
I'm still fat as a cow,
I haven't slept in months,

23:29.665 --> 23:33.416
and I would sell my kid
into slavery for half a Xanax.

23:33.716 --> 23:37.692
I'm not even asking for a whole Xanax,
just give me half.

23:38.591 --> 23:43.016
- So who's Evan having drinks with?
- Oh, Alex, but it's dinner.

23:43.116 --> 23:47.837
I assumed it was drinks 'cause Tom said
he saw Evan walking into some bar.

23:47.937 --> 23:50.208
Great, well, then...

23:50.308 --> 23:52.530
his dinner turned into drinks.
Which means he'll be there all night,

23:52.630 --> 23:55.693
- which means more time for us, right?
- Congratulations to us.

24:05.064 --> 24:07.782
Will you start the salmon, please?

24:08.833 --> 24:10.095
Thank you.

24:12.829 --> 24:15.184
You know, honey, you're just tired.

24:15.284 --> 24:17.397
It's gonna be a lot easier
once you get stronger.

24:17.797 --> 24:20.796
I'm not getting stronger...

24:21.219 --> 24:23.996
so please don't say that. I just...

24:24.096 --> 24:25.803
I just hate when people say that.

24:26.597 --> 24:28.730
We're just trying to be positive.
That's all.

24:28.830 --> 24:31.086
I know.

24:32.407 --> 24:34.409
- It's Evan.
- Put it on speaker.

24:35.008 --> 24:37.346
- <i>Hey, ladies!</i>
- Hey.

24:37.446 --> 24:41.872
So how's Alex?
He still a personal space invader?

24:41.972 --> 24:43.397
<i>Only until the check arrives.</i>

24:43.497 --> 24:47.330
<i>I'm hoping that Bec
might be open to a little OT,</i>

24:47.430 --> 24:48.895
<i>at time and half, of course?</i>

24:48.995 --> 24:50.562
- Why not?
- <i>Evan!</i>

24:50.762 --> 24:55.395
<i>Table's ready. That's the hostess.
Love you, hon. I gotta run.</i>

24:55.495 --> 24:57.462
I love you, too.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.095
Isn't he incredible?

24:59.195 --> 25:04.162
Ladies, if I have so much as the flu,
Bill is ready to put me out with the trash.

25:04.262 --> 25:07.229
I don't know what I'd do
without that man.

25:07.329 --> 25:10.627
- I mean, a saint that one.
- Yeah.

25:18.860 --> 25:20.061
Okay.

25:21.918 --> 25:25.662
Bec, in Evan's office, his computer.
Please bring it here.

25:25.762 --> 25:27.525
Okay.

25:34.394 --> 25:36.465
Open it.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.678
Check his emails.

25:40.931 --> 25:43.413
I'm not comfortable doing that.

25:43.613 --> 25:45.126
Then you're fired.

25:52.628 --> 25:54.494
I'll pay you $100.

25:54.793 --> 25:57.361
- You just fired me, remember?
- Two.

25:57.461 --> 26:00.694
I seriously doubt your husband's gonna leave
emails he didn't want you to find right...

26:00.794 --> 26:06.815
Yeah, he will, because he knows
I can't access them because of my hands.

26:10.460 --> 26:14.491
Fine. Fine, but I don't
want your money.

26:16.126 --> 26:18.217
Show me.

26:19.992 --> 26:22.199
See? It's nothing.

26:22.299 --> 26:25.735
Just a whole bunch of messages
in legal gibberish.

26:25.835 --> 26:28.405
There, on the bottom.

26:35.159 --> 26:37.116
Thank you.

26:37.925 --> 26:39.418
You can go.

26:40.459 --> 26:44.444
- Kate, I...
- Please, just go.

27:37.290 --> 27:39.623
Getting all Martha Stewart on my ass

27:39.723 --> 27:43.312
for not evenly chopping vegetables,
I can handle, but...

27:44.502 --> 27:47.091
- I've never seen her like this.
- Like what?

27:48.290 --> 27:50.374
I don't know.

29:06.313 --> 29:07.746
Who is it?

29:07.846 --> 29:10.486
It's her, but it's blank.

29:10.854 --> 29:13.713
I'm sure she's fine. It's not...

29:18.887 --> 29:20.919
Kate?

29:25.620 --> 29:26.963
Kate!

29:27.521 --> 29:30.867
Hey, what happened? What's going on?

29:30.967 --> 29:33.636
Hey, hey.

29:36.087 --> 29:38.054
I wet myself.

29:38.154 --> 29:41.530
Hurry. He can't see me like this.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.755
Okay. Okay.

31:09.418 --> 31:11.633
Bec, I don't wanna be here...

31:11.733 --> 31:15.117
when Evan comes home.
Can you take me somewhere?

31:15.516 --> 31:17.067
I'll pack you a bag.

31:17.167 --> 31:20.981
No, I wanna go. Right away.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.378
Katie?

32:18.115 --> 32:20.300
So what did Miss Priss text you?

32:21.614 --> 32:25.481
- Hey, you must be Kate.
- Miss Priss is fine.

32:25.581 --> 32:28.998
Kate is going to be
staying with us tonight.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.789
Okay.

32:32.214 --> 32:34.881
It's not usually like this.

32:35.380 --> 32:37.798
Yeah, sometimes it's really disgusting.

32:42.447 --> 32:46.779
It's Evan. He's home.
He wants to know where we are.

32:51.047 --> 32:52.647
Awesome.

32:53.147 --> 32:55.014
Are you sure you're okay on the couch?

32:55.613 --> 32:59.214
If I had a dollar for every time
I passed out there...

32:59.858 --> 33:03.445
Just yell if you need anything.
I'm a light sleeper.

33:08.281 --> 33:10.811
What are those?

33:15.728 --> 33:17.577
Songs.

33:18.113 --> 33:19.980
Parts, anyway.

33:20.080 --> 33:24.345
A lot of beginnings. The occasional middle.
Kinda short on ends so far.

33:24.445 --> 33:28.472
Well, is that what you wanna do?
Play music? You never mentioned it.

33:31.241 --> 33:34.555
Probably 'cause I pretty much suck.

33:35.024 --> 33:37.869
But, yeah, kinda, I guess.

33:38.812 --> 33:40.512
That's what you studied in school?

33:40.612 --> 33:44.069
Hardly. My parents didn't even want me
to go to school in Houston.

33:44.169 --> 33:47.045
Why are they so against it?

33:47.406 --> 33:49.912
Oh, I don't know.

33:50.012 --> 33:53.079
Probably 'cause I spent four years
outta high school trying

33:53.179 --> 33:57.179
with nothing to show for it.
Except drawers of these.

33:58.727 --> 34:01.393
You... You put music to them?

34:01.693 --> 34:04.612
Not to this one.
Well, not that I remember, anyway.

34:04.712 --> 34:08.489
Sometimes I write drunk.
Anyway, sleep good.

34:09.588 --> 34:10.610
You too.

34:13.702 --> 34:15.809
I'm sorry about Evan,

34:15.909 --> 34:19.475
and I know you don't like cussing,

34:21.143 --> 34:23.695
but he's a fucking asshole.

34:24.494 --> 34:26.295
Night.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.333
How long you been up?

34:47.543 --> 34:52.043
- Evan called, like, 800 times.
- I have somewhere I'd like to go.

34:54.956 --> 34:56.014
A retirement home?

34:56.114 --> 34:59.591
No, it's an assisted living community
for people of all ages.

35:03.243 --> 35:05.467
This is bullshit.

35:05.943 --> 35:08.234
Take me in, now.

35:13.102 --> 35:17.042
Our guest services administrator
will be just a minute.

35:17.142 --> 35:19.909
I bet you ladies would like
some cool refreshments.

35:20.009 --> 35:21.776
Thank you.

35:22.375 --> 35:24.949
If you're not getting good enough
care with me, then fire my ass

35:25.049 --> 35:28.342
- and find a better replacement.
- Please keep your voice down.

35:28.442 --> 35:30.895
You think anybody in here can hear me?

35:30.995 --> 35:34.642
Look, I don't exactly have a great track
record when it comes to men,

35:34.742 --> 35:38.174
but if this is about your husband having
an affair, why are you taking a bullet?

35:38.274 --> 35:41.241
- Tell him to move his ass in here.
- It's my fault, not his.

35:41.341 --> 35:43.325
That's it. That's it.

35:43.425 --> 35:46.608
Bec, what are you doing? Bec, stop!

35:46.708 --> 35:50.304
Honey, unless those sippy cups
are laced with tequila, we're outta here.

35:50.474 --> 35:54.107
I'm the one who got sick. Not him.

35:54.207 --> 35:59.139
This isn't the life he built,
the life he deserves.

36:00.317 --> 36:04.741
He turns me over in my sleep.
He feeds me, he bathes me.

36:04.841 --> 36:08.241
He does everything but breathe for me.
Believe me, he'd do that if he could.

36:08.941 --> 36:11.473
He's 37 years old.
He deserves happiness.

36:11.673 --> 36:13.740
We all deserve some happiness.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.051
What we don't all deserve...

36:16.874 --> 36:21.884
is a little extra snatch on the side
from some skanky cooze.

36:29.740 --> 36:31.007
- Last night...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

36:31.107 --> 36:35.672
Last night, what were you doing
at the top of the stairs?

36:38.140 --> 36:39.640
I just thought it'd be easier...

36:39.740 --> 36:42.807
- I know what you thought.
- No, you don't.

36:44.358 --> 36:46.833
Okay, you're right, I don't.

36:46.933 --> 36:49.507
I don't even really know you.

36:49.607 --> 36:51.674
But I'm actually starting to like you.

36:54.065 --> 36:57.849
The only other person I ever
saw up close like this was my grammy.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.284
Every Thanksgiving,

36:59.384 --> 37:02.507
my redneck cousins would bet
against her lasting 'til Christmas.

37:02.607 --> 37:06.706
And 12 years straight they lost.
Because she didn't take shit from anyone.

37:12.638 --> 37:15.154
Take me downtown.

37:21.138 --> 37:25.313
Alright. I understand. On the 15th...

37:25.438 --> 37:27.238
I gotta go. Kate.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.672
Thank God you're okay.
I've been worried sick about you.

37:30.772 --> 37:33.939
- Where the hell have you been?
- I want you to move out.

37:34.491 --> 37:36.145
- What?
- She said sh...

37:36.245 --> 37:38.570
I heard what she said.

37:39.936 --> 37:42.731
Can you give us a minute, please?
In private.

37:43.271 --> 37:44.772
Thank you.

37:47.508 --> 37:48.703
Okay.

37:50.673 --> 37:53.188
It's not what you think,
and I'm not leaving.

37:53.288 --> 37:56.592
- Then I will.
- What are you saying? You want a divorce?

37:56.692 --> 37:59.104
You're divorcing me,
after everything that we've been through,

37:59.204 --> 38:00.971
- everything that I've...
- What?

38:01.071 --> 38:03.911
Everything you've what, Evan?

38:08.370 --> 38:10.404
Katie, please.

38:11.529 --> 38:16.102
- It was a mistake. I made one mistake.
- This isn't about your mistake.

38:16.202 --> 38:19.741
This is about me not being able to live
one more second feeling guilty

38:19.841 --> 38:22.770
for what I did to your life.

38:22.870 --> 38:27.303
I can't do it anymore.
I'm not gonna... wait for you in bed.

38:27.403 --> 38:30.303
- Katie, come on, just...
- I'm not gonna share a house with you.

38:30.403 --> 38:34.303
- Katie, please.
- No. Bec! No. Don't touch me.

38:34.403 --> 38:36.357
Kate, come on.

38:38.947 --> 38:40.403
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Hi, Kate.

38:40.503 --> 38:43.102
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

38:44.001 --> 38:46.790
Oh, and he's all yours,
you skanky cooze!

39:02.770 --> 39:04.969
You alright?

39:06.656 --> 39:10.366
I think I just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

39:12.335 --> 39:14.898
You wanna give him a call?

39:18.302 --> 39:19.945
No.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.354
I'll be okay.

39:25.129 --> 39:28.207
I just feel bad.
You know, she's all alone.

39:28.307 --> 39:30.267
What if something happens to her
during the night?

39:30.367 --> 39:32.368
I just wanna say,
if I see you in a sweater set,

39:32.468 --> 39:36.267
I'm gonna go backwards
Texas hoodrat on her ass.

39:36.367 --> 39:38.242
Later.

40:46.632 --> 40:48.689
Turn it off.

40:49.332 --> 40:52.523
- Why?
- Please, just turn it off.

40:52.623 --> 40:56.648
- Is this you playing?
- Damn it, Bec, just turn it off now.

41:01.473 --> 41:05.288
<i>- You have one message from...
- Liam.</i>

41:19.364 --> 41:21.164
Hey, okay.

41:21.364 --> 41:23.962
Shit, shit, shit.

41:24.062 --> 41:25.864
Okay.

41:26.264 --> 41:28.331
Here. Drink. Drink. Hey!

41:28.431 --> 41:32.589
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.
Just breathe. Breathe with me. Breathe.

41:32.689 --> 41:36.730
Hey. What do I do?
What do I do? Shit, shit.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.498
<i>You contacted Emergency Alert.
Help is on the way.</i>

41:39.598 --> 41:43.476
- Cancel.
- What? You want me to cancel?

41:47.531 --> 41:49.433
This is...

41:49.533 --> 41:53.729
This is Bec Cartwell,
calling on behalf of Katherine Parker.

41:53.829 --> 41:58.406
I accidentally triggered the alarm
and I need to cancel it.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.280
Thank you.

42:04.096 --> 42:07.029
Don't ever do that again,
without asking me.

42:07.229 --> 42:11.245
- Hey, I thought that you...
- I don't care.

42:12.129 --> 42:16.064
It's my decision to make, not yours.

42:16.164 --> 42:18.261
You understand?

42:19.652 --> 42:21.293
Say it.

42:28.429 --> 42:30.684
I understand.

42:35.562 --> 42:37.629
Hey, you.

42:38.228 --> 42:40.477
You ever coming back to my class?

42:40.577 --> 42:42.629
Professor.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.965
It's "professor" now?

42:46.298 --> 42:48.303
That's not good.

42:49.129 --> 42:52.095
You should know you just broke
my personal record.

42:52.195 --> 42:56.171
Most unreturned phone calls
from a former girlfriend.

42:56.396 --> 42:58.928
I hardly think I was ever a girlfriend.

42:59.028 --> 43:01.329
We could work on that.

43:02.007 --> 43:03.904
If...

43:04.004 --> 43:06.597
you ever call me back.

43:08.594 --> 43:13.927
Do you think God invented sex so we could
bear each other's shortcomings?

43:14.027 --> 43:17.984
Because every time we do that,
I forget all the stuff I hate about you.

43:18.494 --> 43:21.360
I wasn't aware you hated
anything about me.

43:22.837 --> 43:25.851
So will you quit cutting my class now?

43:26.460 --> 43:27.735
Sorry.

43:28.235 --> 43:31.027
Just a lot going on with Kate right now.

43:31.127 --> 43:33.001
Kate? Who's Kate?

43:33.201 --> 43:36.160
Do you ever listen to anything I say?

43:36.260 --> 43:38.627
Kate, the patient friend
I take care of.

43:40.713 --> 43:41.626
Something funny?

43:41.726 --> 43:44.295
You're actually responsible
for another person's life?

43:48.265 --> 43:50.361
Where you going?

43:50.594 --> 43:54.993
Economists think about costs, not just
in terms of an item's monetary value,

43:55.093 --> 43:59.409
but also the opportunity costs
of a particular item...

44:10.626 --> 44:14.959
I'm now in the chair,
and it's harder to breathe.

44:15.059 --> 44:18.226
My voice, too. Especially at night.

44:18.326 --> 44:21.525
Well, that's to be expected.
This process only moves in one direction,

44:21.625 --> 44:24.534
but attitude goes a long way, Kate.

44:25.983 --> 44:28.350
- So, this one, too.
- No.

44:28.450 --> 44:31.522
- Come on.
- Yes.

44:33.661 --> 44:35.313
No, not those.

44:41.864 --> 44:44.949
Alright, take 'em
before I change my mind.

44:45.309 --> 44:47.568
Oh, my God.

44:50.624 --> 44:52.889
I look like you.

44:55.125 --> 44:57.398
Girl, go!

44:57.808 --> 45:01.723
This is, like, the Porsche of wheelchairs
and it's just sitting here.

45:01.823 --> 45:04.418
I know. Evan bought it
for me a year ago.

45:09.457 --> 45:10.857
So what's the problem?

45:11.528 --> 45:15.091
Riding in one of those
is like admitting I'm sick.

45:15.191 --> 45:17.190
Which I am, so it's crazy.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.689
Why don't you give it a whirl?
If you hate it, we'll throw it in the trash.

45:24.491 --> 45:26.532
Go, girl.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.509
I'm catching up. Go on.

45:34.556 --> 45:38.696
A little? Come on, just a little.
Give me a couple of kicks.

45:38.796 --> 45:41.687
There you go. Just try it.

45:44.289 --> 45:48.722
My husband bet you had
a spinal cord injury,

45:48.822 --> 45:51.756
but I can spot one of my own
a mile away.

45:52.056 --> 45:55.553
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes.

45:55.659 --> 45:57.856
He lost.

45:58.056 --> 46:02.319
Now he owes me the sexual favor
of my choice.

46:03.720 --> 46:07.022
I'm Marilyn and this is John.

46:07.122 --> 46:11.389
And now, in addition to other
intimate details, you also know our names.

46:11.888 --> 46:16.407
I'm Kate, and this is my...
This is Bec.

46:16.545 --> 46:19.710
After this water torture,

46:20.055 --> 46:22.905
would you care to partake

46:23.005 --> 46:26.098
in a little herbal therapy?

46:26.641 --> 46:31.275
It's not the prescribed treatment
for this painful-ass disease,

46:31.375 --> 46:35.819
but it sure does feel good.

46:51.138 --> 46:54.417
I'm a grown woman... taking up pot.

46:56.032 --> 46:58.838
Did she just say "taking up pot"?

47:00.033 --> 47:03.841
We got ourselves a wild one here!

47:04.886 --> 47:07.285
I'm happy and I don't know why.

47:09.420 --> 47:12.928
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

47:14.987 --> 47:19.419
This damn illness...
It may take my arms, my legs,

47:19.519 --> 47:23.475
my chest, my breathing, my heart...

47:23.918 --> 47:26.521
but no matter how hard it tries,

47:26.621 --> 47:30.385
it'll never be able
to take away my funk.

47:37.383 --> 47:39.206
Yeah!

47:39.306 --> 47:41.727
That's it. Hit it, girl.

47:43.153 --> 47:46.472
Yeah. Go on, girl.
Come on, girl, get it.

47:49.051 --> 47:51.180
- You seeing this?
- Hell, yeah, I see you.

47:51.287 --> 47:54.920
Shit, yeah. Yeah, you heard right.

47:55.020 --> 47:59.185
Shit, shit, damn. Shit, damn, damn.
Shit, damn, shit, damn, damn, damn, shit.

47:59.285 --> 48:01.337
Fuck.

48:02.593 --> 48:05.502
We done lost her now.

48:21.551 --> 48:25.583
Hey, Kate, it's me, Evan.

48:27.603 --> 48:30.531
Can you please just call me back?

48:31.430 --> 48:34.284
Just call me back.

48:34.384 --> 48:39.449
I just wanna hear your voice, alright?
Just let me know that you're okay.

48:49.450 --> 48:55.870
Has anyone here actually met Dirty Barry?
Because I haven't and I am here a lot.

48:55.970 --> 48:59.084
I'm not waiting for you, of course.
It's just I have lots of things to do.

48:59.184 --> 49:03.701
But I'm Wil. We spent
a night together, an evening.

49:03.801 --> 49:05.883
"Bill" Wil, remember? Hi.

49:05.983 --> 49:08.516
I remember, sort of. Hi.

49:08.616 --> 49:10.349
Hi. I'm I'm Wil.

49:10.449 --> 49:12.348
- Kate.
- Kate.

49:14.218 --> 49:15.894
Are you always such a gentleman?

49:15.994 --> 49:19.482
Oh, no. I'm actually just trying
to make a good impression

49:19.582 --> 49:21.397
so you'll tell your friend
to go out with me again.

49:21.497 --> 49:23.795
How do you know Bec?

49:25.359 --> 49:26.690
Best sex of my life.

49:26.790 --> 49:29.248
- Hey, okay, hi.
- And now she won't call me back.

49:29.348 --> 49:33.550
Shame on you, Bec. Apologize at once
and go out with this fine young man.

49:33.650 --> 49:36.782
- Your friend is very wise.
- She also happens to be my boss,

49:36.882 --> 49:41.119
so, you know, she doesn't
wanna hear about our time together.

49:42.431 --> 49:44.083
So, are you playing tonight?

49:44.183 --> 49:45.732
- No.
- Why not?

49:46.949 --> 49:50.749
'Cause there's only so much failure
and humiliation a person can take.

49:50.849 --> 49:53.408
Well, here's the thing, Bec,

49:53.508 --> 49:55.645
I heard you sing a couple of notes

49:55.745 --> 49:59.848
before you had your accident
that night that we... that we met.

49:59.948 --> 50:01.851
And if I can...

50:01.951 --> 50:05.881
name any song in three notes...
which I can, by the way...

50:05.981 --> 50:10.748
I can name a good singer in two.
And you're a really good singer.

50:11.103 --> 50:12.120
So...

50:14.457 --> 50:16.748
- So... Wil...
- No.

50:17.547 --> 50:18.887
Stop.

50:19.087 --> 50:22.581
I know what you're thinking.
He's just...

50:22.781 --> 50:26.280
- He's not...
- What? The one?

50:27.044 --> 50:30.847
Trust me, from someone
who got the one, it's overrated.

50:30.947 --> 50:34.104
Okay. It's my life to screw up
as I see fit. Okay?

50:35.513 --> 50:37.410
Okay.

50:37.980 --> 50:39.947
But...

50:40.047 --> 50:42.321
he's really cute.

50:46.013 --> 50:49.879
You know, right around the time
that I met Evan...

50:51.956 --> 50:56.048
there was this guy... Harwick Windsor.

50:56.450 --> 50:58.956
He was a musician.

50:59.961 --> 51:02.679
He came over to my house,

51:02.779 --> 51:06.864
and he stood on my porch
with a guitar...

51:07.245 --> 51:11.844
and he played a song
that he'd written for me.

51:14.579 --> 51:16.812
And when it was finished,

51:16.912 --> 51:22.577
he looked at me the way nobody
has ever looked at me.

51:28.812 --> 51:31.445
Why is it that...

51:31.718 --> 51:35.410
we want the ones that don't see us...

51:35.908 --> 51:38.968
instead of the ones that do?

51:50.311 --> 51:52.992
- Okay.
- Now lipstick.

51:54.599 --> 51:57.851
- This one?
- Too loud.

51:58.176 --> 52:00.268
For you.

52:11.610 --> 52:12.767
It's gonna be fine.

52:19.210 --> 52:21.544
- Excuse me.
- Kate, hi.

52:21.644 --> 52:23.343
- You look gorgeous.
- You too.

52:23.443 --> 52:25.443
- So glad you came.
- Me too.

52:25.543 --> 52:27.443
Hey, Taylor. Come here, honey.

52:29.189 --> 52:30.210
Hey, Taylor.

52:30.310 --> 52:33.827
Look at the beautiful present
that Auntie Kate brought you.

52:36.228 --> 52:38.677
Didn't your mommy ever teach you
it's not polite to stare?

52:38.777 --> 52:40.646
Bec.

52:42.510 --> 52:44.527
So nice to see you, Kate.
How you feeling?

52:44.627 --> 52:45.744
- Good.
- Good.

52:45.844 --> 52:48.210
Kate, there you are!

52:48.310 --> 52:52.076
Hey, pretty girl,
there's someone I need you to meet.

52:53.776 --> 52:56.011
- Hi.
- She's beautiful.

52:56.210 --> 53:00.648
Say hi to your Auntie Kate. Say hi.

53:00.748 --> 53:02.497
Can I hold her?

53:03.496 --> 53:04.473
Okay.

53:10.379 --> 53:13.040
There you go.

53:13.140 --> 53:16.309
- She looks just like you.
- I think she looks like her daddy.

53:16.571 --> 53:19.809
I read that, actually, babies look like
their daddies when they're born,

53:19.909 --> 53:22.377
so their daddies don't run...

53:25.297 --> 53:29.176
Okay, okay, okay. I got her, I got her.

53:31.072 --> 53:33.038
Just breathe. Take it slow.

53:34.908 --> 53:37.436
- I told you this wasn't a good idea.
- Is she okay?

53:37.536 --> 53:40.272
Just look at me. Just breathe.

53:52.408 --> 53:55.128
Now we know why Kate was invited.

53:55.228 --> 53:56.736
I needed to see you.

53:58.049 --> 54:00.306
You've lost weight.

54:00.842 --> 54:03.627
She says you look like shit.

54:05.790 --> 54:06.904
You've lost weight.

54:08.172 --> 54:12.072
Yeah. Yeah, maybe a little.

54:12.172 --> 54:15.851
- I'm not ready to see you, Evan.
- She's not ready to see you.

54:16.050 --> 54:18.260
Okay.

54:20.091 --> 54:22.569
I just want you to know
I never saw her again.

54:22.669 --> 54:24.372
What are you looking for? A medal?

54:24.472 --> 54:27.639
No one gives a shit
about your sex life, Evan.

54:27.739 --> 54:30.953
You're not you. You're me.

54:36.840 --> 54:40.938
It's not about Cynthia. It never was.

54:43.620 --> 54:47.940
She says it wasn't about Cynthia.
It was never about her.

54:48.439 --> 54:51.973
- It's about being invisible.
- Feeling invisible.

54:54.334 --> 54:57.018
- I love you.
- And she says she loves you.

54:57.318 --> 55:01.904
- Take care of yourself.
- And to take care.

55:20.937 --> 55:23.307
I miss him.

55:23.968 --> 55:26.207
I miss... me.

55:26.307 --> 55:28.571
- Hey.
- Us.

55:28.771 --> 55:30.004
Kate.

55:32.009 --> 55:34.887
I shouldn't have asked to hold it.

55:35.303 --> 55:36.471
- The baby?
- Yeah.

55:36.571 --> 55:38.805
No, the baby's fine, Kate.

55:38.905 --> 55:44.117
I know, but my arms.
I tried... I tried to catch her.

55:46.671 --> 55:49.190
- Did you hear her scream?
- She wasn't screaming, she was crying.

55:49.290 --> 55:52.402
Babies cry. That's what they do.

55:53.646 --> 55:56.698
I wanted a baby...

55:59.570 --> 56:01.770
so bad.

56:02.133 --> 56:05.159
I wanted to travel.

56:05.833 --> 56:08.016
I wanted to play music.

56:08.737 --> 56:11.370
Now it's too late.

56:12.469 --> 56:15.742
I have so much inside.

56:17.731 --> 56:20.107
Nothing comes out.

56:20.207 --> 56:22.670
Tell me what you want to come out.

56:23.810 --> 56:26.776
I wanna... I wanna scream.

56:26.876 --> 56:29.835
I just, I wanna...

56:29.935 --> 56:32.415
scream.

56:47.702 --> 56:51.455
Do you think we'll get invited back
to the party next year?

56:58.484 --> 57:03.089
Six months ago, you were breathing
at a 64 per cent capacity. Now it's 43.

57:03.189 --> 57:05.702
Are you wearing your BiPAP at night?

57:05.802 --> 57:07.802
No.

57:09.334 --> 57:11.422
I don't like it.

57:11.522 --> 57:14.434
It makes me feel like I'm suffocating.

57:14.534 --> 57:15.631
Well, look, Kate,

57:15.731 --> 57:19.268
it's gonna get harder and harder
for you to get oxygen into your lungs.

57:19.368 --> 57:22.301
Soon, we'll be looking
at a permanent ventilator.

57:22.401 --> 57:27.244
But when she's on the machine,
can she even talk?

57:42.966 --> 57:45.533
I never did this.

57:46.191 --> 57:48.235
Did what?

57:49.234 --> 57:51.331
Nothing.

57:53.551 --> 57:56.895
I think that's what's wrong
with my life.

57:57.332 --> 58:00.397
I didn't know this was doing nothing.

58:05.832 --> 58:08.466
I know you trust him and all,

58:09.165 --> 58:11.823
but he didn't mention even one
of the experimental drugs

58:11.923 --> 58:14.262
they're testing right now.

58:16.571 --> 58:18.899
Don't do that.

58:20.676 --> 58:24.386
- Do what?
- What all the others do.

58:24.785 --> 58:27.351
Pretend.

58:36.332 --> 58:39.935
I know it's not my place, because...

58:40.035 --> 58:43.365
I'm not the one
who has this thing, but...

58:44.887 --> 58:47.402
please don't give up.

58:51.964 --> 58:54.908
That's the thing about giving up.

58:56.118 --> 58:59.777
You don't realize you've done it
until it's too late.

59:01.326 --> 59:03.455
Like music.

59:03.555 --> 59:06.560
I didn't suddenly stop.

59:08.116 --> 59:11.580
I started playing less and less.

59:12.279 --> 59:15.337
Until I wasn't playing anymore.

59:16.036 --> 59:19.524
And it also just didn't fit with...

59:19.624 --> 59:22.145
everything.

59:23.930 --> 59:26.229
Evan-everything?

59:29.897 --> 59:32.896
Did you ever give up on something big?

59:35.264 --> 59:41.230
Besides life, singing, school,
pleasing my parents, love?

59:41.330 --> 59:44.329
No, no, no.

59:44.872 --> 59:48.022
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

59:49.487 --> 59:51.996
So this is how it goes.

59:52.096 --> 59:56.595
It's Christmas at my mother's,
New Years Eve at Alyssa's,

59:56.695 --> 01:00:01.963
and a very traditional
Thanksgiving at Keely's.

01:00:02.063 --> 01:00:04.530
Personally, I'd rather staple my tits
to a burning building

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:08.954
than have Christmas
or Thanksgiving at Keely's.

01:00:09.054 --> 01:00:11.592
You know what?

01:00:12.094 --> 01:00:14.186
Me, too.

01:00:27.262 --> 01:00:30.361
- Honey, that's Jill's date.
- Right.

01:00:31.943 --> 01:00:34.465
Okay.

01:00:35.528 --> 01:00:38.621
A toast to friends...

01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:41.073
old, new...

01:00:41.173 --> 01:00:45.195
- Reluctantly invited.
- My guest. Not reluctant.

01:00:45.595 --> 01:00:48.061
Like... I was saying...

01:00:48.161 --> 01:00:52.503
to friends, old and new,
but most of all, to Kate.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:56.746
Who's the bravest, toughest,
coolest, chick I know.

01:00:58.831 --> 01:01:01.987
- Thank you.
- To Kate.

01:01:04.323 --> 01:01:05.763
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:01:41.226 --> 01:01:43.872
Boy, you ain't got no game.

01:01:44.815 --> 01:01:47.143
Go ask her to dance.

01:01:49.683 --> 01:01:51.959
Would you care to dance?

01:01:55.159 --> 01:01:57.017
Sure.

01:02:05.658 --> 01:02:07.738
It's Brazilian.

01:02:13.239 --> 01:02:17.475
You ever wish you weren't just watching
moments like this?

01:02:17.575 --> 01:02:20.656
Oh, I'm not just watching.

01:02:20.956 --> 01:02:23.249
I feel it.

01:02:24.225 --> 01:02:28.256
Feel life more than I ever
felt it before.

01:02:33.058 --> 01:02:35.358
How come you never ask me
to translate for Kate?

01:02:36.969 --> 01:02:38.957
I read lips.

01:02:39.057 --> 01:02:41.922
- Nice try.
- It's true.

01:02:45.557 --> 01:02:50.088
- What's that mean?
- My older brother is deaf.

01:03:00.423 --> 01:03:02.257
- You just said something pervy.
- No, I didn't.

01:03:02.357 --> 01:03:04.489
What did you say? Come on.

01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:06.848
I said...

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:10.389
maybe one day you'll stop punishing me

01:03:10.489 --> 01:03:14.521
for liking you as much as I do.

01:03:19.323 --> 01:03:21.855
I should start cleaning up.

01:03:36.423 --> 01:03:38.623
Surprise.

01:03:39.123 --> 01:03:41.955
Happy Thanksgiving

01:03:42.055 --> 01:03:44.372
- to you...
- What are you doing here?

01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:47.521
- You know why I'm here.
- You're drunk.

01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:50.731
- Just a little bit.
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

01:03:50.831 --> 01:03:54.515
You know, I think you say that
because you think it makes the sex hotter.

01:03:54.615 --> 01:03:56.298
Which it does.

01:04:00.321 --> 01:04:02.687
Go home, now, to your wife.

01:04:02.837 --> 01:04:05.255
Come on. Now. To your wife.

01:04:05.355 --> 01:04:09.652
Come on. I want you. I know you want me.

01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:15.182
Oh, come on. I miss you.

01:05:25.086 --> 01:05:30.353
You can have... everything.

01:05:32.086 --> 01:05:34.610
Everything.

01:05:34.919 --> 01:05:39.540
Just don't let me end up
like that. Please.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.517
I can't die in a hospital,
strapped to a machine.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:59.122
I'm not condoning what he did.
It was wrong.

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:03.284
- For God's sake, it's time to forgive him.
- Men cheat. It happens.

01:06:03.384 --> 01:06:07.317
But she didn't have to blow up his whole
life. I mean, blow up all our lives.

01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:09.317
So, why'd you want me to come here?

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:12.418
You want me to apologize
for her inconveniencing you?

01:06:12.518 --> 01:06:14.251
Okay, you clearly
don't like me very much.

01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:16.383
Which is fine because I don't
really like you either.

01:06:16.483 --> 01:06:19.532
- Alyssa...
- So are you in the will yet?

01:06:19.632 --> 01:06:21.606
- Alyssa!
- She can't expect to come out of nowhere

01:06:21.706 --> 01:06:24.216
and expect people not to ask questions
about her intentions.

01:06:24.316 --> 01:06:26.450
- Wait.
- I mean, we were her friends first.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.547
Alyssa, shut up.

01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:37.482
Look, just tell her that we love her.

01:06:38.457 --> 01:06:41.161
And that we miss her.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.348
And that we're here.

01:06:49.449 --> 01:06:52.380
You will not believe what I...

01:06:57.315 --> 01:06:59.515
- Who's this?
- Rachel.

01:06:59.977 --> 01:07:02.749
I just thought maybe we could
give you a break some time.

01:07:02.849 --> 01:07:04.889
Okay.

01:07:06.016 --> 01:07:08.683
- So you don't cook or clean?
- Yes, absolutely...

01:07:08.783 --> 01:07:11.549
- Any experience with ALS?
- Not specifically...

01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:15.916
- She's worked with disabled people.
- But not ALS?

01:07:16.016 --> 01:07:18.877
- No.
- We'll be in touch.

01:07:19.705 --> 01:07:21.149
We'll be in touch.

01:07:21.249 --> 01:07:24.035
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:07:26.849 --> 01:07:29.745
- I'm sorry I didn't discuss it with you.
- I get it.

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:32.748
- It's not to take over.
- No, I get it.

01:07:33.002 --> 01:07:36.280
Actually, I don't get it.
What's going on?

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.867
You have school...

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:40.998
your music.

01:07:42.414 --> 01:07:44.403
I'm worried I'm asking too much.

01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:48.471
Have you ever heard me complain?
Have you? I'm fine.

01:08:34.179 --> 01:08:36.046
Hey.

01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:38.377
Hi.

01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:47.645
So, I've...

01:08:47.944 --> 01:08:50.944
been thinking about us a lot.

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:56.278
And I could have been more patient.

01:08:59.045 --> 01:09:02.312
You know, I thought that I was
at the time, but I really wasn't.

01:09:02.412 --> 01:09:06.578
And I'm sure there's 9,000 other things
that I could've done better, too.

01:09:07.816 --> 01:09:10.325
You should know...

01:09:10.769 --> 01:09:16.109
that it wasn't... it wasn't just sex.
Okay. It was...

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:18.478
I just needed...

01:09:18.578 --> 01:09:23.176
I just needed to... touch someone
without hurting 'em, that's all.

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:31.877
But I just want you to know
that I'm sorry.

01:09:36.444 --> 01:09:38.537
I'm sorry.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:51.411
Do you remember...
when we re-met after UT?

01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:55.009
- Yeah. At your concert, yeah.
- And afterwards,

01:09:55.109 --> 01:09:58.975
we went to 300 Houston
and drank Martinis.

01:09:59.374 --> 01:10:01.107
Yeah.

01:10:03.207 --> 01:10:08.801
That night, I could see in your eyes...

01:10:09.344 --> 01:10:11.545
that you didn't see me for who I was.

01:10:11.645 --> 01:10:14.430
- Kate, that's not...
- But...

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.980
then again...

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:20.824
I wanted to be the woman you saw.

01:10:21.699 --> 01:10:26.451
So... it wasn't just you.

01:10:28.002 --> 01:10:29.443
We did this.

01:10:38.873 --> 01:10:42.394
You want me to go up and down
or around and around?

01:10:50.009 --> 01:10:52.168
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:54.466 --> 01:10:57.152
Brace yourself. Your parents are here.

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:58.776
- What the hell?
- They're outside.

01:10:58.876 --> 01:11:02.684
They came by the apartment
and... Merry Christmas.

01:11:02.784 --> 01:11:03.942
Yeah.

01:11:06.663 --> 01:11:09.641
- I didn't know you were coming.
- We left you five messages.

01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:13.544
- Didn't you check them?
- Of course, Mom.

01:11:16.474 --> 01:11:18.703
Come on in.

01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:21.444
Dad.

01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:28.374
Wanna cut the evening short?
I can make a pass at your mom.

01:11:31.364 --> 01:11:34.530
- This is Kate.
- Merry Christmas.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.948
I'm Elizabeth...

01:11:38.472 --> 01:11:40.488
and this is Bruce.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:42.640
Nice to meet you.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.740
Would you like to stay for dinner?

01:11:46.884 --> 01:11:49.784
She wants to know if you want
to stay for dinner?

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.607
Thank you. I'm sure
I can whip something up.

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:57.006
I got it.

01:11:57.106 --> 01:12:01.392
Oh, that's right. I cook now, Mom.
Lasagna's in the oven.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.544
So, are you actually living here now?

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:24.790
Your wife sounds like Bec.

01:12:25.589 --> 01:12:27.481
What's in the back?

01:12:27.672 --> 01:12:31.938
Your wife's voice sounds like Bec.

01:12:34.956 --> 01:12:36.336
One... One more time.

01:12:36.473 --> 01:12:39.255
When your father and I
didn't hear from you

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:43.038
for a couple of weeks... and I didn't get
a tuition bill for a couple of months...

01:12:43.138 --> 01:12:46.971
- Can we talk about this another time?
- I decided to finally call the college.

01:12:47.471 --> 01:12:49.872
- I was gonna call you.
- Oh, really? When were you gonna call me,

01:12:50.271 --> 01:12:53.388
<i>and let me know
that you had decided to drop out?</i>

01:12:54.251 --> 01:12:56.638
No. Leave it.

01:12:56.738 --> 01:12:59.199
<i>- I'm just taking some time off.
- Rebecca,</i>

01:12:59.299 --> 01:13:03.471
you spend more time taking time off than
you do in college. What are you doing here?

01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:07.638
If you're actually asking me a question,
I'd be happy to answer it.

01:13:07.838 --> 01:13:11.394
<i>But if this is just another one of your ways
to put me down, by all means...</i>

01:13:12.485 --> 01:13:13.901
Answer it.

01:13:15.264 --> 01:13:17.953
I'm doing something...

01:13:18.053 --> 01:13:20.357
positive.

01:13:20.457 --> 01:13:24.371
Something good.
I'm helping another human being.

01:13:24.471 --> 01:13:26.604
No, Rebecca, my darling, you're not.

01:13:26.704 --> 01:13:29.971
What you are doing is exactly
what you've done your entire life.

01:13:30.171 --> 01:13:33.012
You're focusing all of your energy,

01:13:33.112 --> 01:13:37.470
all of your time, on something
that is doomed to fail.

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:40.996
That poor, poor woman
out there is going to die.

01:13:41.596 --> 01:13:45.935
And when she is gone,
where does that leave you?

01:13:46.085 --> 01:13:49.227
With no future, no degree,

01:13:49.327 --> 01:13:53.979
and no means of supporting yourself.

01:13:54.673 --> 01:13:56.761
Nothing.

01:14:02.969 --> 01:14:05.336
Merry Christmas to you, too, Mom.

01:14:06.156 --> 01:14:09.716
Come back in here, Rebecca.
I am not done talking to you.

01:14:09.816 --> 01:14:13.134
- <i>Rebecca, you come back in here.</i>
- Shit.

01:14:22.436 --> 01:14:25.085
Why didn't you tell me you dropped out?

01:14:25.185 --> 01:14:29.236
Please, Kate, I've already had,
and lost, this fight once today.

01:14:29.336 --> 01:14:31.002
Your mother is right.

01:14:31.102 --> 01:14:34.802
My mother has never been right
about anything in my entire life.

01:14:34.902 --> 01:14:37.268
- I am going to die.
- With that attitude.

01:14:37.368 --> 01:14:40.635
It's not an attitude, Bec. It's a fact.

01:14:41.034 --> 01:14:42.934
There are experimental drugs.

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:45.255
- If your doctor would...
- I want you to move out.

01:14:49.967 --> 01:14:52.533
That's ridiculous.

01:14:53.979 --> 01:14:56.926
- Who's gonna take care of you?
- I'll call my mother.

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:58.634
Your mother who lives an hour away,

01:14:58.734 --> 01:15:01.200
who hasn't been here to visit you
once since I've been here?

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:04.900
I'm not gonna let someone else
ruin their life because of my illness.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.766
I didn't tell you
about school because...

01:15:06.866 --> 01:15:10.818
Like you didn't tell me about having
an affair with a married professor.

01:15:12.344 --> 01:15:13.970
You've been damning Evan.

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:16.867
What's the difference
between you and Cynthia?

01:15:16.967 --> 01:15:19.998
I'm dying and his wife isn't?

01:15:24.067 --> 01:15:26.300
Fuck you.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.011
Fuck you.

01:15:29.367 --> 01:15:34.823
You wanna die, and you know I won't
let you, and that's what this is about.

01:15:35.475 --> 01:15:37.984
I'm outta here.

01:15:56.633 --> 01:15:59.727
Look at you.

01:16:00.231 --> 01:16:02.310
My family's home.

01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:04.466
Hi, Gwen.

01:16:04.865 --> 01:16:07.167
Oh, darlin'.

01:16:07.267 --> 01:16:08.992
You know,
I always preferred your hair up.

01:16:09.092 --> 01:16:11.865
I'm gonna send my hairdresser over
in a little while. Okay?

01:16:11.965 --> 01:16:14.832
It'll give you such confidence.

01:16:15.265 --> 01:16:18.565
Now, how come y'all
haven't opened your presents?

01:16:18.665 --> 01:16:22.202
- What in the world is going on here?
- Here, Gwen, let me help.

01:16:22.302 --> 01:16:26.900
Oh, here, I got you something special.

01:16:31.998 --> 01:16:34.507
Merry Christmas, darlin'.

01:16:45.063 --> 01:16:47.313
And you remember Evan?

01:16:48.075 --> 01:16:49.040
Hi.

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.761
- Enjoy the bar.
- Sure.

01:16:53.418 --> 01:16:55.476
I've got somebody for you to meet.

01:17:05.631 --> 01:17:10.006
There's the belle of the ball,
and my favorite niece.

01:17:10.412 --> 01:17:14.483
First things first. Inoculation.

01:17:19.429 --> 01:17:23.065
I've done too many of these
Christmas parties without you.

01:17:23.821 --> 01:17:26.148
Having fun yet?

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:30.194
Over the moon.

01:17:39.795 --> 01:17:43.926
"I told you,
it was a 'Yankee doodle dandy'."

01:17:46.977 --> 01:17:47.993
Christmas cheer.

01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:54.643
Bec.

01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:59.303
Hi.

01:18:00.096 --> 01:18:01.902
Hi.

01:18:04.502 --> 01:18:07.305
Are you playing tonight?

01:18:10.462 --> 01:18:13.023
Not feeling very musical.

01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:15.789
How's Kate?

01:18:18.154 --> 01:18:20.279
I wouldn't know.

01:18:20.379 --> 01:18:22.595
She kinda fired me.

01:18:22.695 --> 01:18:26.532
Or broke up with me.
I'm not really sure which.

01:18:27.227 --> 01:18:29.760
Turns out it's no different
than breaking up with a guy.

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:34.759
You still torture yourself listening to
their music and going to their weird places.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.156
You never called me back.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:42.394
It's complicated.

01:18:43.977 --> 01:18:45.191
It's complicated.

01:18:48.776 --> 01:18:52.206
Out of curiosity, if...

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.880
If I was to be...

01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:00.080
dumb enough to ask you out on a date,

01:19:01.926 --> 01:19:04.987
would I stand a chance?

01:19:07.893 --> 01:19:09.991
I'm just not...

01:19:11.475 --> 01:19:13.686
Alright, okay.

01:19:13.786 --> 01:19:17.233
Say hi to Kate... or...
I'm sorry about...

01:19:17.333 --> 01:19:20.958
you getting fired. She was cool.

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:25.526
Wil!

01:19:28.301 --> 01:19:32.087
I'm thinking one day I might
come to my senses, so...

01:19:34.758 --> 01:19:37.823
don't lose my number. Okay?

01:19:46.265 --> 01:19:48.141
Hello?

01:20:09.474 --> 01:20:13.739
Hey. I'm here to see Kate.

01:20:37.154 --> 01:20:38.957
Progress.

01:20:39.257 --> 01:20:43.632
- How you doing, Bec?
- Our friend Marilyn died.

01:20:43.946 --> 01:20:46.907
Oh. I'm sorry to hear about that.

01:20:50.052 --> 01:20:52.793
I thought Kate should know. Wasn't something
I wanted to tell her on the phone.

01:20:52.993 --> 01:20:55.956
Yeah, of course.

01:20:56.056 --> 01:20:57.756
Will you tell her about Marilyn?

01:20:57.856 --> 01:21:01.472
I'm not sure
that's the best idea right now.

01:21:02.389 --> 01:21:05.655
This is a copy of the letter
that Marilyn's husband

01:21:05.755 --> 01:21:07.769
sent all of her friends when she died.

01:21:11.123 --> 01:21:13.717
Kate'll wanna hear it.

01:21:25.889 --> 01:21:30.796
"Marilyn called herself
the black Lou Gehrig.

01:21:31.308 --> 01:21:34.038
Most of you know what that means.

01:21:34.138 --> 01:21:38.286
But some of Marilyn's younger friends
might appreciate knowing that Lou Gehrig

01:21:38.386 --> 01:21:40.787
was a baseball player
for the New York Yankees."

01:21:40.887 --> 01:21:45.205
He played in a record
2,130 straight games,

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:48.088
over 17 seasons,
until ALS forced him to retire.

01:21:48.188 --> 01:21:51.431
"He bid farewell to his fans
and teammates by saying,

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:55.217
'I consider myself the luckiest man
on the face of the earth.'

01:21:55.654 --> 01:21:58.421
What he meant was that although adversity
had weakened his body,

01:21:58.521 --> 01:22:01.988
it had strengthened his connection
to those around him.

01:22:02.088 --> 01:22:05.570
- To sound like anyone you know?"
- In Marilyn's final years,

01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:10.886
she developed bonds with more
people than I can count.

01:22:12.571 --> 01:22:14.820
We were married...

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:19.383
44 wonderful years.

01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:24.948
"But we were never closer
than we were during those final four.

01:22:27.386 --> 01:22:30.331
So pardon me for saying
that I too feel like the luckiest man

01:22:30.431 --> 01:22:32.580
on the face of the earth."

01:23:44.784 --> 01:23:47.051
"In the event I am not capable
of giving you full consent,

01:23:47.151 --> 01:23:49.117
I designate and appoint
the person listed below

01:23:49.217 --> 01:23:51.118
as my attorney-in-fact
for all healthcare decisions."

01:23:51.218 --> 01:23:54.951
- Why the hell didn't you say no?
- She asked for my help and I gave it.

01:23:55.051 --> 01:23:57.551
How can Evan not have medical power
of attorney? He's her husband.

01:23:57.651 --> 01:24:01.717
- He's her attorney husband.
- She can give it to whomever she wants.

01:24:03.536 --> 01:24:06.155
- Did you know about this?
- I just got off the phone with a judge,

01:24:06.255 --> 01:24:09.684
and he said that whenever a patient's health
takes a turn for the worse,

01:24:09.784 --> 01:24:12.650
changes like this... last-minute changes...
don't usually hold up.

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:14.483
- Then it's settled.
- No, it's not settled.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.551
It's not what Kate wants.
Legally, yes, you're right.

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:20.671
- No, she goes on a ventilator now.
- Evan?

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:27.409
Look, I'm sorry, Gwen.

01:24:27.509 --> 01:24:29.816
I know that you're upset, but we have
to honor what she wants to do.

01:24:29.916 --> 01:24:32.015
We have to honor what she wants to do.

01:24:32.115 --> 01:24:34.248
You heard what the doctor said, honey.

01:24:34.348 --> 01:24:37.049
If she don't do this now,
we may not see her tomorrow.

01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:41.213
I know. I know.

01:24:41.513 --> 01:24:43.545
I know.

01:24:49.065 --> 01:24:51.748
- When did she come in?
- Earlier tonight.

01:24:51.848 --> 01:24:53.682
Did they ventilate her?
She didn't want that.

01:24:53.782 --> 01:24:56.231
Not yet. They wanna talk to you first.

01:24:56.331 --> 01:24:59.366
Alright. She left it up to you.

01:24:59.866 --> 01:25:01.672
Me?

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:11.822
What did you do? What've you done?

01:26:12.869 --> 01:26:16.719
I told the doctor...
she wants to go home.

01:26:17.247 --> 01:26:19.714
And you'll put her on a ventilator?

01:26:20.513 --> 01:26:24.635
- That's not what she wants.
- Don't you tell me what my daughter wants.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.845
How dare you? She is my daughter.

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.346
Ma'am...

01:26:38.712 --> 01:26:42.709
Please... don't do this.

01:26:43.348 --> 01:26:46.441
Don't take her from us.

01:26:47.257 --> 01:26:49.879
I'm not taking her from you.

01:26:49.979 --> 01:26:53.030
I'm just taking her home.

01:30:21.706 --> 01:30:24.327
I can't do it.

01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:29.605
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

01:30:29.705 --> 01:30:32.573
I can't sit here and watch her die.

01:30:46.937 --> 01:30:50.001
I love you so much.

01:31:30.703 --> 01:31:33.713
She put me in plaid.

01:31:35.193 --> 01:31:37.082
What?

01:31:44.136 --> 01:31:47.830
If ALS didn't kill me...

01:31:48.309 --> 01:31:50.878
plaid would.

01:32:07.035 --> 01:32:09.035
Don't...

01:32:10.526 --> 01:32:13.806
come back in here tonight.

01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:26.064
Don't call for help.

01:32:36.601 --> 01:32:41.301
- Also promise...
- That's a lot of promises.

01:32:47.301 --> 01:32:50.705
Find someone...

01:32:52.062 --> 01:32:53.900
who...

01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:57.214
sees you.

01:32:59.501 --> 01:33:00.877
Someone who sees me?

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.952
You...

01:33:09.052 --> 01:33:12.916
let... him...

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.735
see the person I see.

01:33:21.133 --> 01:33:23.798
The person you see.

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:25.932
Yeah.

01:33:27.594 --> 01:33:32.079
Okay, now you gotta
promise me something.

01:33:33.376 --> 01:33:36.529
I'm gonna pay you a compliment...

01:33:36.898 --> 01:33:39.498
and you just gotta
lay there and take it.

01:33:45.532 --> 01:33:48.772
Thanks for the Manolos...

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:53.256
and for teaching me how to cook.

01:33:56.332 --> 01:33:58.161
But the biggest thing...

01:33:58.999 --> 01:34:02.198
that I have to thank you for...

01:34:03.399 --> 01:34:06.664
is that you didn't let me fuck this up.

01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:12.702
Because no one in my life
has ever done that for me.

01:34:34.163 --> 01:34:36.257
Go now.

01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:43.720
Go on.

01:37:26.624 --> 01:37:33.025
<i>Finally I'm laying down these arms</i>

01:37:33.125 --> 01:37:38.324
<i>The ones I held so close
to see me through</i>

01:37:38.424 --> 01:37:42.947
<i>And I'm just like a sparrow in a barn</i>

01:37:43.047 --> 01:37:48.003

01:37:48.558 --> 01:37:53.625
<i>I dive head-first into the dark

01:37:53.725 --> 01:37:58.657
<i>I trip and fall, I hit the ground,
I skin my knees, I just keep going</i>

01:37:58.757 --> 01:38:03.724
<i>I made a mess, I've been a mess, I guess
And guess what... life is messy</i>

01:38:03.824 --> 01:38:06.988
<i>And if I learned anything</i>

01:38:08.894 --> 01:38:12.468
<i>At least I'm falling forward</i>

01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:16.606
<i>At least I'm falling forward</i>

01:38:17.006 --> 01:38:19.119
<i>Because of you</i>

01:38:19.618 --> 01:38:22.155
