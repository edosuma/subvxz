Last season on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:06.304 --> 00:08.841
Alien structures
are going up over every city

00:08.842 --> 00:10.047
that we know about.

00:10.048 --> 00:12.812
They flew here in spaceships
and turned kids into slaves.

00:13.316 --> 00:14.667
What's happening to us?

00:15.350 --> 00:18.148
You really think you can
deal with those lizards?

00:19.052 --> 00:20.562
Skitters were our us too.

00:22.001 --> 00:23.845
Who do you think they are?

00:24.201 --> 00:25.468
I don't know.

00:25.524 --> 00:27.372
I wish we could use these
against them.

00:29.017 --> 00:31.171
We don't have enough people
 left for a suicide mission.

00:33.355 --> 00:35.185
The harness...
is a process.

00:35.416 --> 00:37.266
And Ben isn't free
from it.

00:37.332 --> 00:40.173
They'll call him back...
unless you go with them.

00:40.528 --> 00:41.950
You don't want to do this.

00:41.953 --> 00:43.654
No, I don't.

Tom?

00:57.771 --> 00:58.871
Tom.

01:34.965 --> 01:37.133
Anthony!

01:49.715 --> 01:52.751
Open fire!

02:12.872 --> 02:14.707
Where the hell
is our backup?!

02:19.814 --> 02:22.649
Keep your heads down!
Make every shot count!

02:30.825 --> 02:32.993
Remember the drill,
Five-O --

02:33.028 --> 02:35.929
arms, legs,
then the <i>cabeza!</i>

02:35.964 --> 02:37.931
You ever think you enjoying
these turkey shoots

02:37.965 --> 02:39.666
a bit too much,
convict?!

02:39.700 --> 02:41.334
Life
hands you lemons...

02:41.369 --> 02:43.203
Go!

02:43.238 --> 02:45.740
...you blow
its frigging head off!

02:51.948 --> 02:55.084
Cease fire!
Save your ammo!

02:56.720 --> 02:59.957
Cease fire!
Ben! Stop shooting!

03:04.128 --> 03:07.097
Captain!
We look good down here!

03:07.132 --> 03:09.066
Get the hell out of there!

03:09.100 --> 03:12.436
We got...eight minutes, tops,
before those beamers respond!

03:12.470 --> 03:15.139
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

03:20.112 --> 03:22.380
Jimmy, stay close!

03:24.816 --> 03:26.050
Ben! Come on!

03:26.084 --> 03:28.819
We're moving out.
Got one still moving.

03:30.288 --> 03:32.756
- Can't get a shot.
- Well, leave it!

03:33.959 --> 03:35.226
Ben!

03:50.375 --> 03:54.345
Ben! What the hell
are you doing?

04:03.855 --> 04:06.224
Ben.

04:06.258 --> 04:07.892
Ben, orders
are to bug out.

04:07.927 --> 04:10.295
There's another one.
I can feel it.

04:24.212 --> 04:25.546
Dad?

04:25.580 --> 04:27.281
Dad!

04:27.315 --> 04:29.149
It's Dad.

04:29.184 --> 04:31.385
Dad? Dad.

04:31.453 --> 04:33.855
Ben. Ben.

04:33.889 --> 04:35.557
Hal.

04:37.893 --> 04:40.328
You're alive, thank God.

We got beamers
on top of us!

05:00.849 --> 05:03.217
Where the hell
is Hal and Ben?!

05:03.252 --> 05:05.019
That wasn't
eight minutes!

05:05.054 --> 05:07.489
Looks like the bad guys
are growing a brain.

05:07.523 --> 05:09.525
Captain, hold on!
Hold on, Captain!

05:09.559 --> 05:11.894
Got to get him
in the back of the truck!

05:11.928 --> 05:13.229
Tom!

05:13.263 --> 05:14.564
He's hurt bad.
Get the back open.

05:14.598 --> 05:16.065
Let's get him
in the truck!

05:16.100 --> 05:18.334
Pope, Anthony,
get out of here now!

05:18.369 --> 05:20.336
Get him in the back!

05:20.371 --> 05:22.472
Where's he hurt?
Come on! Hurry up!

05:22.506 --> 05:25.074
Mason?

05:25.109 --> 05:27.610
Where the hell
did <i>he</i> come from?

05:29.379 --> 05:32.081
Go, go! Go, go!

05:43.460 --> 05:45.294
Easy, easy!

05:45.362 --> 05:49.432
Dr. Glass!
Dr. Glass! Anne!

05:49.466 --> 05:51.033
Somebody get Anne!

05:51.067 --> 05:52.301
Incoming!
Out of the way, people!

05:52.369 --> 05:53.436
Get out of the way!

05:53.470 --> 05:55.305
Let him through!
Easy, easy.

05:55.372 --> 05:57.240
Tom Mason is alive!
Tom?

05:57.275 --> 05:58.942
Is he okay?
Oh, my God. Tom?

05:58.976 --> 06:01.611
He's been shot.
He lost a lot of blood.

06:01.646 --> 06:03.947
Anne.
Was it a Mech?

06:03.981 --> 06:06.216
Tell Ben
it wasn't his fault.

06:06.250 --> 06:09.452
Uh, it was an accident --
friendly fire.

06:10.988 --> 06:13.322
I didn't know!
It was dark.

06:13.390 --> 06:15.491
Ben, I got to go.

06:19.996 --> 06:23.098
Ben, it's okay.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.577
Let's turn him over.

06:36.413 --> 06:38.481
No exit wound.

06:38.515 --> 06:40.917
That means the bullet's
still inside. Okay.

06:40.951 --> 06:42.351
Lourdes,
I need his pressure.

06:42.419 --> 06:44.119
Uh-huh.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.322
Dad! Dad!
Hey, buddy.

06:47.357 --> 06:48.523
What happened to him?!

06:48.591 --> 06:50.291
He's been hurt pretty bad,
buddy.

06:50.325 --> 06:52.460
But he's gonna be okay,
right?

06:52.494 --> 06:54.462
90 over 70.

06:54.496 --> 06:56.931
Start an I.V., okay,
and...

06:56.965 --> 07:00.167
go get the propofol
we found in Fitchburg.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.502
I can't stop the bleeding

07:01.536 --> 07:03.170
until I find out where
the bullet is, okay?

07:03.205 --> 07:04.672
I have to go in, Tom.

07:04.706 --> 07:07.307
Guys, I know how much
you want to be here, but...

07:07.342 --> 07:09.609
She's right. Come on.
Let's give them some room.

07:09.644 --> 07:11.444
Let's give them
some room.

07:13.213 --> 07:15.681
Come on, Ben.
It's all right.

07:15.715 --> 07:17.182
Let's give them
some room.

07:17.216 --> 07:20.318
Thanks for that.

07:20.352 --> 07:24.022
I go in blind like this,
I could make things worse.

07:24.057 --> 07:27.393
I trust you.

07:46.515 --> 07:48.349
Hey!

07:48.384 --> 07:50.317
I've been here for days!

07:50.352 --> 07:52.386
I want to know about my son!

08:05.166 --> 08:06.600
No!

08:09.771 --> 08:12.506
Don't.

08:15.109 --> 08:16.410
Karen?

08:18.145 --> 08:20.679
Sorry for this, Tom.

08:24.117 --> 08:26.452
I hope you're not afraid.

08:26.519 --> 08:28.019
Whatever you think
they've done to me,

08:28.054 --> 08:30.722
I'm still Karen.

08:37.461 --> 08:39.495
This way.

08:49.306 --> 08:51.640
You said what they were doing
to Ben was a process.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.276
Whatever it is,
can it be stopped?

08:53.310 --> 08:55.311
- That's up to you.
- Me?

08:55.346 --> 08:57.448
Tom,
it's time to face facts.

08:57.482 --> 08:59.083
They've won.

08:59.117 --> 09:02.287
There's no use prolonging
hostilities for either side.

09:02.321 --> 09:05.123
Meaning what? They're asking
for a cease-fire?

09:05.157 --> 09:07.291
No, they're allowing
the resistance

09:07.326 --> 09:09.060
to surrender.

09:09.094 --> 09:11.596
"Allowing the resistance
to surrender"?

09:11.630 --> 09:13.598
Sounds like we've been more
trouble than they expected.

09:13.633 --> 09:16.568
Don't overestimate
a few small victories.

09:16.602 --> 09:20.439
The resistance
is an inconvenience.

09:20.474 --> 09:23.575
They are offering you
a gift, Tom --

09:23.610 --> 09:26.679
a chance to have a life,
a real life,

09:26.746 --> 09:28.681
with Hal and Matt
and Ben.

09:28.748 --> 09:30.149
After everything
they've done,

09:30.183 --> 09:31.583
you expect me
to take that on faith?

09:31.618 --> 09:33.085
No.

09:33.119 --> 09:36.488
Not on faith.

09:36.522 --> 09:38.490
Once you hear
what they have to offer,

09:38.524 --> 09:42.794
I'm sure you'll understand...
everything.

10:08.711 --> 10:10.612
So, they finally
got the bullet out,

10:10.647 --> 10:12.648
but Anne says he's looking
pretty weak.

10:12.682 --> 10:15.518
Your father's a fighter, Hal.
I know that firsthand.

10:15.552 --> 10:16.853
Yeah, but you saw
the way he looked.

10:16.887 --> 10:18.521
There's no telling what else
he's been through.

10:18.556 --> 10:19.857
How's Ben handling it?

10:19.891 --> 10:21.692
He's been keeping
to himself.

10:21.726 --> 10:23.828
You know, he's got to feel
like hell.

10:23.862 --> 10:25.830
You notice anything else
about him?

10:25.864 --> 10:27.799
Look, Ben's fine,
all right?

10:27.833 --> 10:29.567
If the Skitters are still
pulling his strings,

10:29.635 --> 10:31.202
I think they'd make him miss
every now and then.

10:31.236 --> 10:34.471
I still want you
to keep an eye on him.

10:34.506 --> 10:36.140
Now, I know
that you're worried

10:36.174 --> 10:39.877
about your father, Hal,
but we got a situation here.

10:39.911 --> 10:41.712
Yeah, like how this
eight-minute escape window

10:41.746 --> 10:43.747
just turned into two.
Those munitions we lucked into

10:43.781 --> 10:45.883
allowed us to inflict
some serious pain,

10:45.917 --> 10:48.819
but these ambushes were
supposed to be a holding action

10:48.854 --> 10:50.955
till we got new orders.

10:50.989 --> 10:53.624
You're not thinking about
backing down, are you?

10:53.658 --> 10:57.029
We haven't heard word one
from any of the other units

10:57.063 --> 10:58.897
since that attack
on Boston.

10:58.932 --> 11:00.699
For all I know, we're the only
ones still left in the fight.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.802
And I'm for killing these
bastards every chance we get,

11:03.837 --> 11:06.739
but we get boxed in,
we may not come out.

11:06.773 --> 11:08.841
So we <i>don't</i> get boxed in.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.242
All right?
We're finally drawing blood.

11:10.276 --> 11:12.010
That was the point,
right?

11:12.045 --> 11:13.912
Got to hurt them
as much as they hurt us.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.792
I'm gonna go get some air.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.694
If anything changes,
just come outside.

12:02.659 --> 12:05.660
The girl told us you were
a historian before we came.

12:05.695 --> 12:06.995
Karen?

12:13.135 --> 12:14.669
It's not her anymore, is it?
I'm talking to you?

12:14.703 --> 12:17.939
She is allowing me
to speak through her.

12:17.973 --> 12:20.208
"Allowing"?
She has no choice.

12:20.242 --> 12:23.044
You took her like you took...
Ben and everything else.

12:23.079 --> 12:25.713
There was
no other way.

12:25.748 --> 12:27.315
We've studied you
in great detail, Professor.

12:27.350 --> 12:30.685
We've drawn from that
to make a proposal

12:30.719 --> 12:33.187
that would end hostilities
between us.

12:33.255 --> 12:35.590
In exchange
for sanctuary,

12:35.624 --> 12:37.659
we will set aside
a protected area

12:37.693 --> 12:40.094
where human survivors
will be relocated.

12:40.129 --> 12:41.996
Some kind
of prison camp.

12:42.031 --> 12:45.233
A place where you would be
allowed to live in peace.

12:45.268 --> 12:47.969
You must be familiar
with the concept.

12:48.003 --> 12:51.239
It's taken directly
from your own history.

12:51.273 --> 12:53.975
The worst of it.

12:54.009 --> 12:56.077
You can't hand-pick
from our darkest moments

12:56.111 --> 12:57.745
like Cambodia
or Nazi Germany.

12:57.780 --> 13:01.282
Or Nanking, My Lai,
the trail of tears.

13:01.317 --> 13:02.817
Please,
Professor Mason.

13:02.852 --> 13:05.020
We can think of dozens
of more examples.

13:05.054 --> 13:09.157
Be honest.
Oppression is in your nature.

13:09.192 --> 13:13.628
And <i>that</i> is your justification
for the murder of billions?

13:13.662 --> 13:17.732
If those atrocities
are the <i>worst</i> of us...

13:17.799 --> 13:19.734
what does that make you?

13:19.801 --> 13:24.971
The ones who will decide
if your world lives or dies.

13:30.945 --> 13:32.379
Ben, I've been looking
for you.

13:32.414 --> 13:34.215
I wanted to be by myself
for a while.

13:34.249 --> 13:35.883
You heard
what happened, right?

13:35.917 --> 13:39.353
Yeah. I know you didn't mean
to hurt dad.

13:42.391 --> 13:44.226
You're going out again.

13:44.260 --> 13:45.994
Got no choice.

13:46.028 --> 13:49.064
Pope and Anthony sent another
alien patrol our direction.

13:49.099 --> 13:51.200
We don't ambush them
on our terms,

13:51.234 --> 13:54.068
they could roll
right over us.

13:54.103 --> 13:55.336
It's not fair!

13:55.371 --> 13:57.238
I-I should be going
with you.

13:59.108 --> 14:01.709
Okay,
you're nowhere near ready.

14:01.743 --> 14:04.711
Because everyone keeps
treating me like a little kid.

14:04.746 --> 14:08.248
I'm old enough to fight.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.717
Old enough to know <i>how,</i>
<i>at least.</i>

14:10.751 --> 14:11.951
How about this?

14:12.019 --> 14:15.121
When I get back,
I'll see what I can do.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.123
Thanks.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.763
Sure you're up for this?

14:23.797 --> 14:26.933
Skitters are coming,
whether we like it or not.

14:28.836 --> 14:31.104
Hey, thanks, buddy.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.241
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead. You first.

14:34.275 --> 14:36.943
Wow. You sure know how
to impress a girl.

14:36.978 --> 14:39.712
What's next --
his and her grenade launchers?

14:39.747 --> 14:42.815
Who knows? I might do something
crazy like open a door for you.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.149
Hey, Ben!

14:44.217 --> 14:47.452
Hey, wait up!

14:50.322 --> 14:52.257
Hey, I know what happened
with Dad was an accident,

14:52.291 --> 14:53.792
but the next time
I give an order,

14:53.826 --> 14:56.394
I need to know
you're gonna listen.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.062
Whatever you say.

14:58.096 --> 15:00.798
Hey. Hold up. Hey.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.168
What's up, man?
I don't get you.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.270
I mean, as much as he got
into it with Weaver,

15:05.305 --> 15:07.106
Dad always understood
chain of command.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.977
I'll follow your orders,
but you're not Dad, okay?

15:28.094 --> 15:31.330
Pretty sweet spot
for wasting Skitters.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.165
Put a shooter up on the roof
with a Barrett.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.035
Yeah, a .50-Cal will put a hole
through anything.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.537
Maybe get
a cross fire going

15:37.571 --> 15:39.406
with that dry cleaner
right there.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.175
While you kids
get that started,

15:41.209 --> 15:42.843
me and the brain trust, we'll
get the cooties' attention.

15:42.878 --> 15:44.979
We'll come back
to the north side.

15:46.548 --> 15:49.283
Get out of the truck!
Take cover!

15:49.318 --> 15:51.385
Get out of the truck!
Do it now!

15:56.958 --> 15:59.359
Get down!

16:05.231 --> 16:08.333
Not the Harley!

16:14.841 --> 16:17.476
Pope! Stop! Stop!

16:22.082 --> 16:23.816
Come on, man.
Let it go, bro.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.051
Let it go!

16:25.085 --> 16:27.120
Come on!

16:40.607 --> 16:42.608
What the hell
went wrong?

16:42.642 --> 16:45.311
Damned if I know.
Never even got off a shot.

16:45.345 --> 16:48.347
They're onto us.
There's something else.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.016
The way they kept laying fire
into the truck

16:50.050 --> 16:51.918
after we bugged out --
it's like <i>that</i> was the target.

16:51.952 --> 16:54.654
We know
they can pick up heat.

16:54.689 --> 16:56.923
Could be the engine
is what got their attention.

16:56.958 --> 16:58.792
First time
they've targeted vehicles.

16:58.826 --> 17:00.327
First time for everything.

17:00.361 --> 17:01.861
With these beamers
on constant patrol --

17:01.896 --> 17:03.429
We're screwed and blued,

17:03.464 --> 17:05.464
and you can kiss
this ambush plan goodbye.

17:05.499 --> 17:08.535
If we can't run our trucks,
we're not mobile.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.904
The Skitters got to know
we're close.

17:10.939 --> 17:12.472
Won't be long before
they catch our scent.

17:19.548 --> 17:24.353
Captain,
you wanted to see me?

17:24.387 --> 17:26.355
Dai tells me
that you're doing a fair job

17:26.390 --> 17:27.957
of taking over for Scott.

17:27.992 --> 17:29.659
He did?

17:30.394 --> 17:31.995
I can only hope
he's right.

17:32.029 --> 17:34.697
We think that the aliens have
recalibrated their beamers

17:34.731 --> 17:36.966
to pick up the heat
coming off our vehicles.

17:37.001 --> 17:39.302
Probably using
some infrared sensor.

17:39.337 --> 17:41.839
As long as we stay put,
engines off, they can't see us.

17:41.873 --> 17:43.574
Only that's not
an option.

17:43.609 --> 17:45.843
Our patrols
just saw three alien units

17:45.877 --> 17:48.512
all walking around out there,
all within five miles.

17:48.547 --> 17:50.781
It's only a matter of time
before they nail us.

17:50.815 --> 17:52.716
If we can't move our vehicles,
we lose our mobility,

17:52.750 --> 17:55.052
and we lose most
of our supplies.

17:55.086 --> 17:57.587
We need to find
a way to mask the heat

17:57.621 --> 17:59.355
coming off those engines

17:59.390 --> 18:01.557
long enough to put some distance
between us and those patrols.

18:01.591 --> 18:02.724
Well, how far?

18:02.759 --> 18:04.726
At least 20 miles.

18:04.761 --> 18:06.862
20 miles?

18:06.896 --> 18:09.964
That would mean keeping the engines
cooled out for at least an hour.

18:12.768 --> 18:15.336
Okay.

18:15.371 --> 18:16.571
All right. I'll try.

18:16.606 --> 18:18.407
You don't get points
for effort.

18:18.441 --> 18:19.675
We don't find a way
to move those vehicles,

18:19.710 --> 18:22.411
people are going to die.

18:23.513 --> 18:25.882
No pressure.

18:35.525 --> 18:38.895
I don't care
what you wanted from us.

18:38.929 --> 18:42.698
There must have been a way
to get it peacefully.

18:42.732 --> 18:44.833
You didn't even try to talk
to us before the attack.

18:44.868 --> 18:47.102
This was never
a negotiation.

18:47.136 --> 18:49.104
That's why we'll never stop
fighting you.

18:49.138 --> 18:52.773
We have no patience
for empty bravado.

18:52.808 --> 18:55.042
So those
are our alternatives --

18:55.076 --> 18:57.110
live as prisoners or die?

18:57.144 --> 19:00.112
Why would you expect
better from us

19:00.147 --> 19:03.716
than you do
from yourselves?

19:03.750 --> 19:05.651
Because I look
around this ship,

19:05.685 --> 19:09.521
at the technology that
brought you from another world,

19:09.556 --> 19:12.791
and I want to believe
that only an advanced species

19:12.826 --> 19:16.061
could have
achieved so much.

19:16.095 --> 19:18.063
But I would be wrong.

19:18.097 --> 19:23.102
You <i>will</i> lead your people
to the neutral zone.

19:29.009 --> 19:30.877
No.

19:30.911 --> 19:33.012
Then the choice
has been made.

19:33.047 --> 19:36.183
I would be careful about drawing
too many lessons from the past.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.819
Why is that?

19:38.854 --> 19:42.957
Because our history
has yet to be written.

20:18.958 --> 20:20.559
Tom Mason, 2nd Mass.

20:20.626 --> 20:22.694
I didn't know
they had anybody else.

20:22.728 --> 20:23.995
Neither did I.

20:24.029 --> 20:25.997
Bonnie Garcia,
Vermont militia.

20:26.031 --> 20:29.701
Bastards wanted me
to lead them to my guys,

20:29.735 --> 20:32.471
talk them into buying
this sanctuary bull.

20:32.505 --> 20:35.507
That's why they took us --
to finish what they started.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.013
This isn't right.

20:54.193 --> 20:55.928
Oh, my God.

21:02.068 --> 21:04.503
Everybody run!
Don't give it a target!

21:04.537 --> 21:05.871
Run!

21:42.554 --> 21:43.934
Find your stance.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.584
Lean forward a bit.

21:47.589 --> 21:50.158
Hey, Ben!

21:50.192 --> 21:52.894
What's Matt doing
with a gun?

21:52.928 --> 21:54.996
Ben's teaching me
how to shoot.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.330
Figured it was time.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.966
He needs to learn
how to defend himself.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.136
So you just gave him a rifle
without asking me?

22:01.170 --> 22:03.539
I might have to follow
your orders on missions,

22:03.573 --> 22:06.008
but not here.

22:11.148 --> 22:13.983
Hal, wait!

22:21.091 --> 22:22.625
Go back to camp, Matt.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.596
Go back to camp.

22:27.631 --> 22:31.100
You know, maybe he's ready,
maybe he's not,

22:31.134 --> 22:33.202
but we both know
Dad didn't want that for him.

22:33.236 --> 22:35.537
Three months ago. How do you
know what he'd say now?

22:35.605 --> 22:37.439
I <i>don't</i> know
what he'd say right now,

22:37.473 --> 22:39.174
and neither do you,
okay?

22:39.209 --> 22:41.676
So how about we wait
and let Dad make that decision?

22:41.710 --> 22:43.077
Only way we win this war

22:43.112 --> 22:44.712
is by killing
every Skitter we see.

22:44.747 --> 22:47.015
If Matt's old enough
to load a gun,

22:47.049 --> 22:48.450
he's old enough
to shoot it.

22:48.484 --> 22:50.051
After what happened
with Dad,

22:50.119 --> 22:53.021
you think you're the best one
to be giving lessons?

22:53.055 --> 22:55.190
I just don't want him
to be taken away

22:55.224 --> 22:56.691
the way they took me.

22:59.561 --> 23:00.728
Or your girlfriend,
Karen.

23:07.068 --> 23:11.071
I'm not the math geek
you used to push around.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.406
Deal with it.

23:20.647 --> 23:23.415
It's like I don't
even know him anymore.

23:23.483 --> 23:25.484
Hal.

23:41.269 --> 23:43.237
Michigan.

24:45.101 --> 24:47.603
- Stop!
- Quit struggling!

24:47.637 --> 24:50.306
Stop! Get off of me!
I swear, if you don't let go of that bag,

24:50.340 --> 24:52.308
I will shoot you!
Leave me alone! It's all we have left!

24:52.342 --> 24:54.143
Please!
I <i>will</i> shoot you!

24:54.177 --> 24:55.644
No!
Do you understand?!

24:55.679 --> 24:58.447
Every store within 20 miles
has been picked clean!

24:58.481 --> 25:00.582
Please! Please!

25:12.461 --> 25:14.295
Run!

25:14.329 --> 25:16.630
If I see you again,
I'll use this!

25:40.690 --> 25:42.491
My name's Tom.

25:46.497 --> 25:49.565
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.568
I just wanted
to see your bike.

25:51.635 --> 25:53.203
No! It's mine!

25:53.237 --> 25:55.338
Hey! Hey!

25:55.372 --> 25:56.573
Stop it!

25:56.640 --> 25:59.508
I'm not letting you
steal it!

26:01.411 --> 26:03.211
Come on. Come on.

26:03.246 --> 26:05.680
I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

26:07.383 --> 26:09.651
Look, I know
that you're scared.

26:11.587 --> 26:16.392
But I'm not
gonna hurt you.

26:16.426 --> 26:18.260
If he comes back,
we don't want to be here.

26:18.328 --> 26:21.698
We had a few cans of soup.
That's all.

26:21.732 --> 26:25.702
Go ahead!
Take it and leave me alone!

26:31.442 --> 26:33.710
You hang on to it.

26:39.451 --> 26:42.721
I'm on my way
into Boston.

26:42.755 --> 26:45.690
I left some people there --
friends and family.

26:45.724 --> 26:47.225
They can help us.

26:47.259 --> 26:51.562
Bike's yours, but I sure
would love to borrow it.

26:51.597 --> 26:52.863
You can come with me.

26:52.898 --> 26:56.333
Boston?
That's hundreds of miles.

26:56.368 --> 26:59.203
Oh, I know it.

26:59.237 --> 27:01.706
I've been on foot
for weeks already.

27:01.740 --> 27:05.910
So...what do you say?

27:08.480 --> 27:10.748
Just remember
it's a loan.

27:10.783 --> 27:14.452
And only
as long as I say.

27:15.921 --> 27:18.923
And only if we don't
leave her like that.

27:22.261 --> 27:23.595
Fair enough.

27:43.008 --> 27:45.258
Captain.

27:45.259 --> 27:47.961
I'll have the med bus packed
and ready to go in a half-hour.

27:47.995 --> 27:49.228
How's Tom?

27:49.230 --> 27:51.631
I need to know what happened
to him on that ship.

27:51.666 --> 27:53.666
Ben and Lourdes are with him.
He's weak.

27:53.701 --> 27:55.268
But if we have to move,
I think it's all right.

27:59.207 --> 28:00.574
Dr. Glass!

28:04.713 --> 28:07.582
Do you know anything
about scotch?

28:09.085 --> 28:11.921
Some's good,
some's better.

28:11.955 --> 28:12.989
Why?

28:14.825 --> 28:17.926
I found this...

28:17.961 --> 28:20.062
couple of stops back.

28:20.097 --> 28:23.633
It's a Glenfiddich.

28:23.667 --> 28:25.068
30 years old.

28:25.102 --> 28:27.837
Someone
has good tastes.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.973
If we have to run,
it's just dead weight.

28:30.007 --> 28:33.611
Seemed like it'd be a shame
to waste it.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.090
Cheers.

28:45.124 --> 28:48.961
Cheers.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.207
Maybe it's a sign --
Tom coming back.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.076
How do you mean?

29:06.110 --> 29:09.379
I mean that if I hadn't let him
get on that ship...

29:11.649 --> 29:14.884
...if he'd been here,
he would have warned me

29:14.918 --> 29:18.287
that we were
pushing our luck.

29:18.322 --> 29:22.158
He would have warned me.

29:22.192 --> 29:25.294
But he wasn't here.

29:25.329 --> 29:27.897
Second-guessing doesn't change
where we are.

29:29.666 --> 29:33.636
I think you're wrong.

29:33.670 --> 29:36.172
I remember something
he told me once,

29:36.206 --> 29:39.175
about making the price
of the occupation so high,

29:39.209 --> 29:41.343
the aliens have to leave.

29:41.378 --> 29:43.712
That was the idea.

29:43.746 --> 29:48.249
He would have said your strategy
is risky but worth it.

29:48.284 --> 29:51.019
And when he wakes up,

29:51.053 --> 29:53.020
he's gonna be proud
we're still fighting.

29:53.055 --> 29:57.292
Hell, he might even have
a historical anecdote

29:57.326 --> 29:59.294
to put it all
in perspective.

30:01.264 --> 30:02.932
Captain.

30:02.966 --> 30:05.901
What the hell is this?
Fiberglass.

30:05.936 --> 30:07.136
It's light,
it's an insulator,

30:07.171 --> 30:08.805
and these warehouses
are full of it.

30:08.839 --> 30:10.073
We wrap our engines
with it,

30:10.108 --> 30:12.175
we'll get a good hour
before it heats through.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.044
I want people going
through every house,

30:14.078 --> 30:15.345
every warehouse
on the block.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.947
We're moving out A.S.A.P.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.248
Dr. Glass?!

30:18.282 --> 30:19.382
Anne?!
Ben?

30:19.417 --> 30:21.384
Anne!

30:21.419 --> 30:24.121
It's my Dad.
Something's wrong.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.890
Let's go.

30:26.924 --> 30:29.426
We're close now.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.795
We got to keep going.

30:33.230 --> 30:36.065
I don't know what happened.
He just started bleeding again.

30:36.099 --> 30:39.803
I must have missed
a fragment.

30:39.870 --> 30:42.071
He feels feverish,
too.

30:42.106 --> 30:45.108
We still have a few bottles
of I.V. antibiotic.

30:45.142 --> 30:46.909
Okay.
Okay.

30:48.478 --> 30:50.446
I'm sorry, Ben.

31:00.958 --> 31:04.461
The school's only a few miles
that way.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.066
But they'd be long gone
by now.

31:11.169 --> 31:14.271
I've been seeing
a lot of airships

31:14.305 --> 31:18.141
heading southwest
to Connecticut.

31:18.175 --> 31:21.144
Could be
they went that way.

31:21.178 --> 31:23.312
The woman we buried.

31:25.048 --> 31:26.782
That was my mom.

31:28.184 --> 31:29.918
I'm sorry.

31:32.188 --> 31:35.323
You never told me why you
helped me out with that guy.

31:38.294 --> 31:41.129
That's what people
are supposed to do.

31:41.164 --> 31:43.999
Not anymore.

31:44.033 --> 31:46.168
I don't believe that.

31:46.203 --> 31:52.175
And I'd hope that someone
would do the same for <i>my</i> kids.

31:58.314 --> 32:01.283
We were going
into the mountains,

32:01.317 --> 32:03.552
trying to find
a place to hide.

32:03.586 --> 32:06.855
I don't think that we can hide
from them anymore.

32:10.893 --> 32:13.861
My middle son, Ben --
you'd like him.

32:13.895 --> 32:15.028
He's about your age.

32:15.063 --> 32:16.063
He's dead.

32:16.131 --> 32:18.499
No.

32:18.533 --> 32:21.969
They're all dead.
That's what happens now.

32:22.003 --> 32:25.205
The aliens find you,
and they kill you.

32:25.239 --> 32:27.507
Unless
we kill them first.

32:27.542 --> 32:30.978
Come on.
We got to keep going.

32:31.012 --> 32:34.381
This engine-blanket thing
better work,

32:34.415 --> 32:36.850
or we'll be wearing
this truck for a hat.

32:36.884 --> 32:38.251
That's another thing.

32:38.319 --> 32:40.554
When the hell did I become
a damn baggage handler?

32:40.588 --> 32:43.223
I was gonna say
it kind of suits you.

32:43.257 --> 32:45.558
Yeah, well, I'll tell you,
if I had any brains,

32:45.593 --> 32:47.560
I'd steal one
of these rice rockets

32:47.594 --> 32:49.929
and kiss Weaver's glorious
revolution goodbye.

32:49.997 --> 32:51.831
Yeah, you try that,
and your brains

32:51.865 --> 32:53.899
will be scattered
across two states, Pope!

32:53.934 --> 32:56.903
You really are a true believer,
aren't you?

32:56.937 --> 32:58.338
In killing Skitters,
yeah.

32:58.372 --> 33:00.341
Yeah, well, that's pretty,
but, uh, you know,

33:00.375 --> 33:02.844
there's no law that says
you got to do it with me.

33:02.878 --> 33:05.246
My merry ex-band of outlaws
wasted your buddy,

33:05.281 --> 33:08.851
and yet here you are,
Tonto to my lone ranger.

33:08.885 --> 33:11.520
Well, first, I think you got
that "Lone Ranger" thing

33:11.555 --> 33:13.089
a bit backward.

33:13.123 --> 33:16.392
And don't think
that I forgot about Click...

33:16.426 --> 33:17.993
or when you patched me up

33:18.028 --> 33:20.529
after we went in
on that alien structure.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.264
I can't make sense
of either.

33:22.298 --> 33:23.398
We all make mistakes.

33:23.432 --> 33:25.533
Captain!

33:25.567 --> 33:26.967
Captain!

33:27.035 --> 33:28.969
Hey, Cap! Incoming!

33:29.037 --> 33:31.405
Anthony, where's Cap?
Right there.

33:31.439 --> 33:33.607
Captain, we got a Mech convoy
about a mile away.

33:33.641 --> 33:36.376
They're straight east.
They're coming this way.

33:36.410 --> 33:40.381
We move that med bus now,
Tom's not gonna make it.

33:45.922 --> 33:48.123
Convoy goes!

33:48.157 --> 33:50.959
Medical stays with Dr. Glass
until she can stabilize Tom.

33:50.993 --> 33:53.128
I need four volunteers
to stay with the bus

33:53.163 --> 33:54.530
in case
the Skitters show.

33:54.564 --> 33:56.299
You know I'm in.
Sounds good.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.567
Make that three.

33:57.601 --> 33:58.968
Four.

33:59.002 --> 34:00.470
Gather all the ammo
you can carry.

34:00.504 --> 34:03.305
Dai's got the map.
We wait for you 20 miles out.

34:03.340 --> 34:06.575
Stay safe.

34:06.610 --> 34:10.312
We're moving out, people!
Five minutes!

34:25.295 --> 34:27.362
All right, guys,
we got incoming.

34:27.429 --> 34:29.965
Okay,
we're gonna go dark.

34:33.136 --> 34:37.239
There's something there.

34:37.274 --> 34:39.241
I just
can't get ahold of it.

34:41.178 --> 34:42.411
All right, guys,
we're gonna lay low

34:42.446 --> 34:44.612
and hope the Mechs
pass us by.

34:44.647 --> 34:47.717
Nobody shoot
unless I give the order, okay?

34:47.751 --> 34:50.085
Hey.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.254
Okay?

35:04.068 --> 35:05.168
Get down!

35:05.202 --> 35:06.669
Not yet.

35:08.338 --> 35:10.306
Lourdes,
we have to hold him steady.

35:20.584 --> 35:22.252
I think I've got it.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.025
Not much to it.

35:28.059 --> 35:31.563
It was enough.
We can close now.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.242
I think they're gone.

35:45.277 --> 35:49.046
Oh, God.

35:59.293 --> 36:01.528
I think that was
our lucky day, right?

36:01.562 --> 36:04.798
Come on. Let's go.

36:10.305 --> 36:12.674
Hey, good job, man.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.843
This is bad.
We need to keep riding.

37:18.877 --> 37:21.845
It's close.

37:21.879 --> 37:23.747
I don't want to
be here anymore!

37:23.782 --> 37:26.750
That's Mech fire.

37:26.785 --> 37:28.985
That's a shotgun.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.520
That means
there's people.

37:30.554 --> 37:32.556
You said when we started
it was just a loan.

37:32.590 --> 37:34.024
Got to see
who's out there.

37:34.058 --> 37:35.492
I'll come back
when I know it's safe.

37:35.526 --> 37:38.361
My mom wanted to show me
the mountains.

37:38.396 --> 37:41.498
I'm going there.

37:41.532 --> 37:42.633
For her.

37:44.669 --> 37:46.369
I hope you find
your family.

37:48.339 --> 37:50.440
Cease fire!
Save your ammo!

37:52.576 --> 37:57.546
We got eight minutes, tops,
before those beamers respond!

37:57.580 --> 38:00.049
So let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Weaver?

38:40.494 --> 38:41.594
Dad?

38:58.756 --> 39:01.492
You're still here.

39:11.627 --> 39:14.462
I never left, Tom.

39:19.100 --> 39:21.201
You gave us
quite a scare.

39:21.236 --> 39:22.969
You feeling all right?

39:23.004 --> 39:25.906
Better.

39:28.210 --> 39:30.511
My boys?

39:32.247 --> 39:34.082
They're fine.

39:35.952 --> 39:38.421
I should have
had faith...

39:38.455 --> 39:41.358
that you'd come back
for them.

39:41.392 --> 39:44.027
Not just for them.

40:03.215 --> 40:05.951
Ben.

40:11.124 --> 40:13.192
It's okay.

40:13.226 --> 40:17.195
Dad, I, uh...

40:17.230 --> 40:19.297
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I know.

40:19.331 --> 40:23.701
It was an accident.
Come here.

40:25.404 --> 40:28.206
It doesn't matter.

40:28.273 --> 40:30.442
All that matters now
is that we're together.

40:33.479 --> 40:34.679
Dad!

40:34.714 --> 40:37.015
Oh. Ben, don't --

40:37.049 --> 40:40.518
Look at what the cat
dragged in.

40:43.622 --> 40:45.222
I missed you, old man.

40:45.290 --> 40:47.692
I missed you, too.

40:47.726 --> 40:50.261
I missed
all of you.

41:10.452 --> 41:12.186
Tom.

41:12.254 --> 41:15.122
- How you feeling?
- Like it's good to be home.

41:15.749 --> 41:18.365
Captain,
we should talk.

41:18.399 --> 41:21.327
Plenty of time for that.
You just get better first.

41:21.361 --> 41:25.209
A lot of people
will be glad to see you.

41:27.710 --> 41:29.242
Welcome back, Tom.

41:29.276 --> 41:31.239
Thanks, Dai.

41:36.238 --> 41:38.672
Professor
happen to mention

41:38.707 --> 41:42.412
how he, uh, busted out
of Skitter Central?

41:42.446 --> 41:44.583
He did not.

41:47.819 --> 41:50.253
Man strolls
onto an alien rocket,

41:50.287 --> 41:54.792
only to just come waltzing back
three months later.

41:54.826 --> 41:56.927
I don't know
about you, Cap,

41:56.962 --> 42:00.465
but I'd be throwing a flag
on that play.
