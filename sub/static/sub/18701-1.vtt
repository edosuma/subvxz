01:35.962 --> 01:38.328
He's dead. He's dead!

01:39.132 --> 01:42.226
- Lights! It's a village.
- No, no. That's Japanese.

01:42.302 --> 01:43.826
There's no choice!

01:43.903 --> 01:45.336
No, I've had enough.

01:45.405 --> 01:49.842
Bataan. Corregidor. You were wrong!

01:49.909 --> 01:54.312
We're free now. We're free.
Free to go our own ways.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.347
We're free.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.883
<i>Borneo. For most of you,</i>
<i>Borneo doesn't exist.</i>

05:26.426 --> 05:30.760
<i>An imaginary name on a map</i>
<i>like Tibet or Tierra del Fuego.</i>

05:31.464 --> 05:33.329
<i>The ends of the earth.</i>

05:33.900 --> 05:36.061
<i>But I know the island exists.</i>

05:36.769 --> 05:40.933
<i>You see, I was there near the end</i>
<i>of the Second World War.</i>

05:41.574 --> 05:44.134
<i>My war. My youth.</i>

05:45.011 --> 05:48.947
<i>I was a botanist before.</i>
<i>I've been a botanist ever since.</i>

05:49.682 --> 05:51.616
<i>That's why they chose me, I suppose.</i>

05:52.085 --> 05:54.349
<i>Special Operations trained me.</i>

05:54.921 --> 05:58.220
<i>I was to help lead the tribes</i>
<i>against the Japanese.</i>

05:58.358 --> 06:00.326
<i>But I didn't lead them, really.</i>

06:00.426 --> 06:03.361
<i>No, that was someone else.</i>

06:04.364 --> 06:08.391
<i>I knew him. He was the last King of Borneo.</i>

06:09.369 --> 06:11.837
<i>It's all right to tell his tale now.</i>

06:11.904 --> 06:14.873
<i>The wind has swept away the stench</i>
<i>of the corpses.</i>

06:14.974 --> 06:18.671
<i>And all that we remember</i>
<i>is the flare of our youth.</i>

06:39.799 --> 06:41.130
Oh, God damn.

06:47.974 --> 06:51.341
Tenga, are you all right? Tenga?

06:52.578 --> 06:53.875
Yes, sir.

06:55.848 --> 06:58.715
Don't appear to have broken anything, sir.

06:59.218 --> 07:02.153
- Yourself, sir?
- Well, I'm upside-down.

07:02.688 --> 07:03.985
Yes, sir.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.791
- Use your knife.
- Yes, sir.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.438
Sorry about that, sir.

08:15.561 --> 08:16.721
Murut?

08:17.697 --> 08:18.823
Lban?

08:20.366 --> 08:21.628
Kelabit?

08:24.804 --> 08:26.169
Comanche.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.639
He said Comanche, sir. He speaks English.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.199
I Comanche.

09:06.579 --> 09:08.513
South-southeast, sir.

09:09.615 --> 09:13.016
Towards the center and up,
into the middle of Borneo.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.937
- I'll take the first watch.
- Yes, sir.

09:39.111 --> 09:42.171
- Well, good night, sir.
- Good night, Tenga.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.942
What the hell is going on, Tenga?

11:31.390 --> 11:33.756
He's a white man, my God.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.218
He's as white as we are.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.074
My name is Fairbourne.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.176
I'm a British serving officer.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.913
Now, why have you done this?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.765
Oh, God.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.629
As I said before,
I'm a British serving officer.

12:52.238 --> 12:57.073
My name is Captain Nigel Fairbourne.
This is Sergeant Lionel Tenga, my radioman.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.302
I'm with Zed Force, Special Operations.

12:59.411 --> 13:02.972
The Japanese are losing the war,
as well as the Germans.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.177
Our side is winning. Am I right, Tenga?

13:05.251 --> 13:07.151
- Right, sir.
- Thank you.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.690
General MacArthur is back
in the Philippines.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.885
The Australians will be landing shortly
to recapture...

13:14.960 --> 13:18.521
I mean, liberate this country.

13:19.899 --> 13:23.665
I have the task of organizing resistance
amongst the tribes.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.438
We need your help, sir.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.902
The wind has veered to the West again.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.071
The British will be back.

14:24.463 --> 14:27.193
Learoyd. I am Learoyd.

14:30.936 --> 14:35.464
When I first arrived at this house, they
wanted to sell my head to the Japanese...

14:36.976 --> 14:39.103
but I didn't know about it.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.113
I had to learn their language like a child.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.284
They know a little English.

14:46.518 --> 14:49.043
It's sacred. Religious.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.880
I ought to explain
that you are in the spirit country.

14:54.260 --> 14:58.856
My people are the sons of the first man,
living by the law of the ancients.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.671
All we men are free.

15:13.512 --> 15:16.640
I have a special relationship with the spirits.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.677
I died once.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.051
I had to.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.550
I had to give up everything.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.724
Even the will to live.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.170
It started in April of '42.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.464
Just before the fall of Corregidor.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.770
When MacArthur skipped out...

15:48.714 --> 15:51.547
some of us figured it was time to go, too.

15:52.051 --> 15:53.814
I remember the waves.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.086
<i>Giant waves.</i>

15:57.656 --> 15:59.089
<i>Men drowned.</i>

16:06.131 --> 16:08.065
<i>Japs killed others.</i>

16:09.501 --> 16:11.332
<i>I alone escaped.</i>

16:21.880 --> 16:25.008
<i>I left the coastal plains,</i>
<i>and I wandered inland.</i>

16:25.217 --> 16:28.983
<i>And then I came</i>
<i>to where the real jungle begins.</i>

16:38.664 --> 16:40.894
<i>I was suffocated by the trees.</i>

16:41.133 --> 16:42.964
<i>I longed for the sky.</i>

16:44.236 --> 16:45.794
<i>But I was free.</i>

16:49.375 --> 16:51.002
<i>Free to do what?</i>

18:12.124 --> 18:15.423
<i>He had been hunting,</i>
<i>and he caught nothing.</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:17.857
<i>Only me.</i>

18:23.135 --> 18:25.467
<i>It was Gwai who brought me here.</i>

18:25.571 --> 18:28.165
<i>Of course, it was this dragon</i>
<i>tattooed on my chest...</i>

18:28.240 --> 18:29.798
<i>that probably saved me.</i>

18:29.875 --> 18:32.901
<i>I got it in Manila one night</i>
<i>when I was drunk.</i>

18:35.180 --> 18:38.980
<i>Lian the Magnificent</i>
<i>was all for selling my head to the Japs.</i>

18:39.051 --> 18:43.044
<i>He had a bunch of hotheads with him,</i>
<i>and they were all steamed up.</i>

18:43.188 --> 18:45.748
<i>They were running these people down.</i>

18:58.770 --> 19:01.170
<i>It was the women who stopped him.</i>

19:01.240 --> 19:03.606
<i>They were fascinated by my eyes.</i>

19:04.276 --> 19:06.836
<i>They said my eyes were like the sea.</i>

19:07.045 --> 19:11.379
<i>The sea means salt, and here, salt is life.</i>

20:04.236 --> 20:07.865
<i>Her name was Yoo, Gwai's sister.</i>

20:08.874 --> 20:13.470
<i>It was said from when she was a child,</i>
<i>she was born to rule.</i>

20:18.483 --> 20:20.974
Smackee. Smackee.

20:35.701 --> 20:39.228
No. Moonshine.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.005
- Moonshine.
- Moonshine.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.375
<i>I lived with the forest, like an animal.</i>

20:48.847 --> 20:53.181
<i>For the first time in my life, I was truly free.</i>

21:15.841 --> 21:19.333
<i>Men here dream of gods</i>
<i>and strike noble attitudes.</i>

21:19.511 --> 21:21.809
<i>They want to rival the heroes of the past.</i>

21:21.880 --> 21:25.441
<i>The time of Rajah Brooke</i>
<i>and the days of high adventure.</i>

21:27.352 --> 21:31.982
<i>For them, it is a man that counts, not life.</i>

23:15.827 --> 23:17.795
<i>We fought for over an hour.</i>

23:17.863 --> 23:21.492
<i>Lian the Magnificent</i>
<i>wounded me seven times.</i>

23:21.633 --> 23:23.692
<i>I struck him in the heart.</i>

23:45.257 --> 23:47.248
<i>I took him to his mother.</i>

23:47.459 --> 23:49.222
<i>We all mourned him.</i>

23:50.362 --> 23:52.023
<i>He was a bad man...</i>

23:52.197 --> 23:56.361
<i>but they all remembered the little boy</i>
<i>who played in this longhouse.</i>

24:04.309 --> 24:06.777
My children. Comanches.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.540
You call them Comanches?

24:08.613 --> 24:11.104
Yes, they remind me of Indians, you know.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.981
You know,
only not like they are in the States...

24:14.052 --> 24:15.519
like they were originally.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.351
I won't have my people
selling kachina dolls and beads...

24:18.423 --> 24:20.891
by the Grand Canyon at some train.

24:21.026 --> 24:25.087
My Comanches will remain Comanches.
Free men. Headhunters.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.264
Go on, then.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.726
What was that?

24:33.505 --> 24:36.372
You're really quite something, aren't you?

24:41.446 --> 24:44.210
<i>Many people from the longhouses came.</i>

24:44.749 --> 24:46.478
<i>They came from the black lands...</i>

24:46.551 --> 24:50.043
<i>and also from the red lands</i>
<i>where the spirits had fled.</i>

24:50.155 --> 24:52.953
<i>Six buffaloes were slaughtered and eaten.</i>

24:53.024 --> 24:55.356
<i>It lasted for three whole days.</i>

24:55.827 --> 24:58.660
<i>And then, on the third day, I spoke.</i>

24:59.664 --> 25:01.894
<i>I told you, men dream of gods.</i>

25:02.200 --> 25:05.169
<i>But you must find the words</i>
<i>to fire the dream.</i>

25:05.237 --> 25:08.263
<i>I spent a whole year learning the words.</i>

26:07.032 --> 26:09.967
<i>Well, I guess it was time I got married.</i>

26:36.361 --> 26:40.889
<i>I brought them the joy of song</i>
<i>and the fellowship of the round table.</i>

26:42.467 --> 26:45.265
<i>I had united 22 longhouses.</i>

26:45.837 --> 26:47.634
<i>Forged a new nation.</i>

26:48.807 --> 26:53.107
<i>Well, I guess I'd become King.</i>

27:01.653 --> 27:04.247
And I guess I became King.

27:08.727 --> 27:12.493
It doesn't matter what you do,
I'll never go back.

27:13.865 --> 27:15.765
What is it you wanted?

27:16.334 --> 27:17.801
In the north...

27:19.170 --> 27:22.298
the Americans are arming the Sulu pirates.

27:22.874 --> 27:27.538
In the south, other teams like mine
are organizing the Dayaks of Sarawak.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.574
There'll soon be general hostilities
in Borneo.

27:32.584 --> 27:35.052
The Australians are going to land.

27:51.036 --> 27:54.062
No one has ever controlled Borneo
from within.

27:54.139 --> 27:58.599
The Japanese, like everybody else,
have only inhabited the rim.

28:01.146 --> 28:04.980
But when we invade,
we will drive them into the center.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.544
What will your kingdom be worth then?

28:08.687 --> 28:11.053
You can no longer avoid history.

28:11.489 --> 28:13.957
This is the Forest of the Spirits.

28:17.395 --> 28:19.556
It's been like this forever.

28:30.742 --> 28:33.176
It's a real hangover morning, eh, sir?

28:55.700 --> 28:58.863
Great Mountain of the Dead.
Beyond is the Plain of Elephants.

28:58.937 --> 29:01.303
And after that, there's the sea.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.664
They'll have to leave us a way to the sea.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.834
Who? The Japanese?

29:04.909 --> 29:07.878
No, the others. The rest of the world.
After the war.

29:07.946 --> 29:11.973
We need salt from the sea.
What's life without a little salt, eh?

29:13.051 --> 29:15.986
As I said, you can no longer avoid history.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.785
Look, when I said I was a deserter,
I meant it.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.327
I quit your world and your war.

29:25.964 --> 29:28.398
This is a better world I live in.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.625
They don't know about your war.

29:30.702 --> 29:33.603
I'm their king,
and I don't want them to know.

29:35.006 --> 29:38.464
It's almost over, anyway.
You can finish it without me.

29:39.043 --> 29:40.601
And the Japanese?

29:40.678 --> 29:42.111
The jungle's a big place.

29:42.180 --> 29:46.276
They'll wander around till they die
or somebody finds them, but it won't be me.

29:46.384 --> 29:50.616
Figure it this way. You're lucky.
I could sell your heads to the Japs.

30:02.233 --> 30:03.666
Well, Tenga?

30:03.768 --> 30:07.864
Yes. Well, sir,
you do have to see it his way, sir.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.471
I mean,
he really doesn't need World War II, sir.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.339
Yes, but World War II needs him.

30:12.410 --> 30:15.709
He just doesn't bloody well understand,
that's all.

30:20.084 --> 30:23.850
You know, sir, this place is not half bad...

30:23.955 --> 30:26.014
if the sun would come out.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.486
Old Learoyd might know
what he's up to, sir.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.825
Watch it, Sergeant.
Don't let this life seduce you.

30:31.963 --> 30:33.954
Remember, you're British.

30:34.699 --> 30:36.724
No, sir. I'm African, sir.

30:36.935 --> 30:40.564
Kikuyu, the King's African Rifles.
I'm almost a savage.

30:42.073 --> 30:43.904
You're British, sir.

30:49.647 --> 30:51.012
Yes, thank you, Hornbill.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.108
This is Semit One,
acknowledging end of transmission.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.675
Over and out.

30:59.123 --> 31:00.715
Your reply from Hornbill, sir.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.886
"As far as your mad American,
make use of him as necessary...

31:03.962 --> 31:06.021
"but arrange earliest possible evacuation."

31:06.097 --> 31:08.861
- Yes, we could expect that, eh, Lionel?
- Yes, sir.

31:08.933 --> 31:12.164
Can't have any kings
save the one in London, sir.

31:18.009 --> 31:20.443
You think she understood us, sir?

31:20.712 --> 31:25.649
Yes. Maybe not the words,
but she understood.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.323
Morning, sir.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.063
Good morning, sir.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.798
Good morning, sir.

31:47.906 --> 31:52.400
I hope you know, sir,
those are the largest boots in all of Asia.

31:53.011 --> 31:55.104
And perhaps the world, for that matter.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.339
Good morning, ladies.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.882
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

31:58.950 --> 32:02.181
Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.450
Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir.

32:30.515 --> 32:32.073
I'll be damned.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.354
You! Yeah, you!

33:12.590 --> 33:15.388
- You did this with your radio!
- Yes, we have a radio. You know that.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.052
Well, the Japs heard it.
They know you're here.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.619
Well, more or less.
If we can hear them, they can hear us.

33:19.697 --> 33:22.097
And if we stay on a bit too long,
they can triangulate...

33:22.166 --> 33:24.634
and I suppose we stayed on too long!

33:24.702 --> 33:26.932
Look, I'm sorry.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.236
Well, it's simple then.
I kill you and break your radio!

33:30.375 --> 33:32.775
Well, they'll just send another man
with another radio!

33:32.844 --> 33:35.074
Listen, you can no longer avoid history!

33:35.146 --> 33:38.206
- I'm sorry. I've said that!
- Shut up. History?

33:40.051 --> 33:43.350
The world's so full of crap,
sooner or later, you're gonna step in it.

33:43.421 --> 33:45.321
You call that history?

33:46.624 --> 33:48.285
It won't go away.

33:51.929 --> 33:54.591
You've got some feathers in your hair.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.561
I want a deal.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.867
A treaty. An ambassador with a sash.
The whole banana.

34:06.944 --> 34:09.674
- Who's the boss?
- Colonel Ferguson, Zed Force.

34:09.746 --> 34:12.181
No, no, no! The kingfish! The big guy!

34:12.250 --> 34:14.377
- The banana! Top guy!
- That'll be MacArthur.

34:14.452 --> 34:17.148
MacArthur? You expect me to make a deal
with the guy that ran out on me?

34:17.221 --> 34:18.279
He came back.

34:18.356 --> 34:20.722
- Well, I'll forgive him.
- He'll be grateful.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.158
Yes, I'll bet so.

34:32.170 --> 34:35.867
- What do you want?
- Freedom to be like we are.

34:37.341 --> 34:41.038
- Anything else?
- Guns. So they can't take the freedom away.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.407
Well, I'll see what I can do.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.380
And grenades, mortars and mines,
so they can't take the guns away.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.610
Yes, I'll see what I can do.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.416
No treaty, no war.

34:53.724 --> 34:56.123
You'll do it all right. You'll do it.

34:56.194 --> 34:57.525
I know your bosses.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.621
You made us hungry. You hurt us.
Worst of all, you hurt our feelings.

35:00.698 --> 35:03.098
I know,
because I was in the labor movement.

35:03.167 --> 35:06.694
I was a renegade. I was in jail.

35:07.171 --> 35:10.231
Hell, I was a Communist!

35:11.609 --> 35:13.543
If you were a Communist...

35:15.480 --> 35:17.380
how can you be a king?

35:18.082 --> 35:20.812
Only a Communist would've thought of it.

35:20.885 --> 35:24.753
I wouldn't stay in there too long.
That's where the pigs shit.

35:28.192 --> 35:30.126
Parachutes. Parachutes.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.814
Well, what do you think?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.515
Knocked them in the eye, eh, Your Majesty?

35:58.589 --> 36:02.252
They were promised an arrival from the sky.
They've seen it. They are content.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.853
She wants to touch them
to make sure they're not ghosts.

36:07.064 --> 36:08.622
I'm Learoyd. This is my daughter.

36:08.699 --> 36:11.725
Yeah, Dave Corbett, demolition.
Dynamite Dave.

36:12.036 --> 36:14.061
- I'm an American like yourself.
- Is that so?

36:14.138 --> 36:15.230
Where are you from, Dave?

36:15.306 --> 36:18.434
Ventura, California.
A little town just north of Los Angeles.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.669
Lots of orange trees.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.542
- California. Must be nice.
- It is, sir.

36:22.613 --> 36:25.309
Have you ever seen Dorothy Lamour?

36:25.383 --> 36:27.010
Oh, mama.

36:27.418 --> 36:31.377
- She must be something, huh?
- She is, sir. I mean, Your Majesty.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.988
I asked for first rate NCO's as advisors...

36:37.061 --> 36:41.464
so that your personal authority
could gradually replace Learoyd's power.

36:41.832 --> 36:44.733
What, you mean the King, sir?
Well, he seems a good bloke.

36:44.802 --> 36:48.203
- Is he really a king?
- For now he is a king.

36:49.273 --> 36:52.333
- Your name, Sergeant?
- Conklin, sir. Team sergeant.

36:52.410 --> 36:53.934
- How do you do?
- This is Armstrong.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.638
Bren Armstrong. Heavy weapons.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.943
- Dynamite Dave. Demolition.
- How you doing, sir?

36:58.015 --> 36:59.983
- American?
- OSS, sir.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.575
- Stretch Lewis, mate. How are you?
- Very good.

37:01.652 --> 37:04.212
- Sergeant Lionel Tenga, my radioman.
- Hi, Tenga.

37:04.288 --> 37:07.257
Now I want to stress from the start
that we represent Great Britain here...

37:07.325 --> 37:10.260
the civilized world and all that it entails.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.825
We're bringing modern warfare
to these savages.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.330
This is a heavy responsibility.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.764
- Sir?
- Yes?

37:17.101 --> 37:19.160
What's the deal on the women?
Are they free?

37:19.237 --> 37:21.205
Now you're talking.

38:22.366 --> 38:24.834
Artillery. Well, that's something.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.696
- You think they can grasp it?
- Yes, it's quite simple, sir.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.799
It's like their blowpipes, only bigger.

38:32.543 --> 38:35.637
Teach them that and they won't be savages
any longer, will they?

38:48.092 --> 38:51.061
You've got that well organized, haven't you?

38:53.731 --> 38:55.289
<i>Our days passed.</i>

38:55.366 --> 38:59.598
<i>And then an incident</i>
<i>at old Sengar's longhouse on the Srai.</i>

39:06.210 --> 39:07.609
What is it?

39:08.446 --> 39:11.210
See, it can go off like this at any time.

39:13.351 --> 39:17.151
If a girl has a child, and she dies...

39:17.655 --> 39:19.020
then they kill the baby.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.718
Now, a girl from this village here,
she had a child.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.420
She had a son, and she died.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.327
Well, what's the fuss?
Why are they moving apart?

39:27.398 --> 39:31.596
Because the father is from our village.
He's a noble, an aristocrat.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.430
He took the girl. She died.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.297
Now if they kill his son...

39:39.710 --> 39:43.237
it will start a feud, a blood feud.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.043
Who is the father?

39:47.385 --> 39:50.149
My brother, Gwai.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.993
Where is the child?

40:02.666 --> 40:04.429
Bring me the child.

40:23.587 --> 40:27.148
These laws do not apply to me,
and I come from far away.

40:27.858 --> 40:31.316
So I can kill the child, as is the way.

41:23.180 --> 41:25.410
My child. This is my child.

41:43.300 --> 41:47.066
Why would you have killed this baby, huh?
Why?

41:48.105 --> 41:50.164
Why would you have let me?

42:09.326 --> 42:11.954
I've seen you do all manner of things.

42:12.229 --> 42:13.457
But now...

42:16.400 --> 42:18.197
I've seen you King.

42:55.806 --> 42:58.468
- Do you think he's sleeping with her?
- No, no, no.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.673
He says he loves his wife, and I believe him.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.110
What's the point of being king
if you can't have the girls?

43:03.180 --> 43:04.977
Well, he can have anything he wants,
but he doesn't.

43:05.049 --> 43:06.846
Well, a man is a man.

43:09.119 --> 43:11.314
You know him as well as I do.

43:12.022 --> 43:14.684
I think he's hiding something from us.

43:15.859 --> 43:17.850
There must be something.

43:22.399 --> 43:24.094
You have no wives.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.764
Who's going to keep you warm at night?

43:28.973 --> 43:33.603
She says you would enjoy
the luster of her thighs...

43:33.677 --> 43:36.237
and the velvet texture of her belly.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.679
That is if you're not too tired.

43:39.917 --> 43:41.908
Did she really say that?

43:43.687 --> 43:46.155
Well, you're twisting my arm, sir.

43:59.069 --> 44:02.197
There's no greater pleasure
than a woman's love.

44:02.539 --> 44:04.097
No, no.

44:05.009 --> 44:09.878
As you once told me,
"War must be chaste and the warrior pure."

44:10.047 --> 44:11.480
I said that?

44:12.916 --> 44:14.076
I don't trust a man...

44:14.151 --> 44:18.019
who can turn away from the hips and thighs
fashioned by the spirits.

44:18.088 --> 44:19.851
But you do. Why?

44:20.658 --> 44:22.819
Maybe it's the old morality.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.718
I love my wife.

44:25.496 --> 44:29.193
You'll go with one of these women in time.

44:35.072 --> 44:38.098
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

44:39.109 --> 44:41.634
If I have a choice
between the good or bad in a man...

44:41.712 --> 44:43.703
I choose to believe the good.

44:43.781 --> 44:45.681
The Warrior King, huh?

44:46.784 --> 44:51.312
No, you're the warrior. I'm just a king.

44:56.193 --> 44:58.184
What do you see up there?

44:59.329 --> 45:00.557
Altair.

45:01.598 --> 45:03.361
The Southern Cross.

45:04.535 --> 45:08.437
There's something here,
something you're not telling me.

45:11.241 --> 45:12.708
I'll show you...

45:14.411 --> 45:15.673
in time.

45:20.951 --> 45:23.818
We must see the Jap. Operations demand it.

45:24.655 --> 45:26.623
Or how else am I to know
they're really out there?

45:26.690 --> 45:28.885
They're out there, all right.

45:28.959 --> 45:30.756
We're gonna split up.

45:31.195 --> 45:34.494
One of us will find the Jap
on the river somewhere.

45:35.132 --> 45:37.430
If something happens,
we're gonna meet up at this open spot.

45:37.501 --> 45:40.061
Grid coordinate 32 west by 16 north.

45:40.204 --> 45:42.035
You'll have to wrap your boots.

45:42.106 --> 45:45.906
If the Japs see those prints,
they'll bomb us again, for sure.

45:46.176 --> 45:48.076
I'd rather go barefoot.

45:48.378 --> 45:50.278
Damn British stoicism.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.144
I'd have you carried upside-down on a pole
if I wanted.

45:53.217 --> 45:55.651
And I should. You've got malaria.

46:25.883 --> 46:27.373
A Jap, by God.

46:28.118 --> 46:30.245
I've never seen one before.

46:32.189 --> 46:35.852
He's got a rifle, too, and a long bayonet.

46:37.528 --> 46:38.722
Nasty.

46:39.830 --> 46:41.923
I think you ought to have a look, Conklin.

46:41.999 --> 46:45.662
No, thank you, sir.
I've seen quite enough of them before.

46:47.704 --> 46:48.932
My God.

46:50.874 --> 46:52.933
He's pissing in the river.

46:55.012 --> 46:56.809
Just like one of us.

46:57.514 --> 46:58.913
Just a man.

46:59.383 --> 47:01.613
I've got to get a closer look.

47:01.885 --> 47:04.376
I've simply got to get a closer look.

47:43.227 --> 47:44.888
Get the hell out!

48:21.131 --> 48:22.393
How long have you been here?

48:22.466 --> 48:24.832
- Quite a while, sir. And you?
- The same.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.563
He should have been here by now, sir.

48:26.637 --> 48:28.468
If we wait much longer,
their patrols will be here.

48:28.538 --> 48:32.304
No. We're not going back without him.

48:33.377 --> 48:35.971
He's just lost. He has malaria.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.299
Wait here.

48:58.802 --> 49:01.896
Keep everybody under cover.
I'll be back soon.

51:40.464 --> 51:41.658
Tenga.

51:43.467 --> 51:47.028
How long have I...
God, I can't remember a thing.

51:47.137 --> 51:49.537
- Three days, sir. Malaria.
- Oh, Jesus.

51:49.706 --> 51:53.039
You haven't been taking your quinine, sir.
Very bad.

51:54.644 --> 51:57.204
Something's happened. I can feel it.

51:57.514 --> 51:58.776
Well, it's started, sir.

51:58.849 --> 52:00.680
- What's started?
- The war.

52:00.750 --> 52:04.186
They've landed at Tarakan.
Just an Aussie brigade.

52:05.255 --> 52:07.917
Just a beachhead, but it'll grow, sir.

52:08.225 --> 52:11.058
- Stirred up a hornet's nest, they did, sir.
- I'll bet it did.

52:11.361 --> 52:13.522
Learoyd. Where's Learoyd?

52:27.978 --> 52:29.570
You saved my life.

52:29.646 --> 52:32.843
I found you. It just happened to be me.

52:33.583 --> 52:36.882
Who's Vivienne?
You kept mentioning her name.

52:38.455 --> 52:39.922
She's my fiancée.

52:40.023 --> 52:42.116
So that's why you wouldn't.

52:42.459 --> 52:45.485
I said I never trusted a man
who had no woman.

52:45.862 --> 52:48.387
I was beginning to worry about you.

52:51.268 --> 52:53.395
I'll get you what you want.

52:55.672 --> 52:57.435
She doesn't believe you.

52:57.507 --> 52:59.338
- Why not?
- Because you're white.

52:59.409 --> 53:00.706
So are you!

53:00.777 --> 53:03.143
When I came here,
I wanted to remake the world. I did.

53:03.213 --> 53:06.671
I remade my world,
but I cannot remake yours.

53:15.458 --> 53:18.188
I'll be back with the treaty.

53:21.598 --> 53:23.964
You're the only one I can trust.

53:26.403 --> 53:27.631
I know.

53:53.096 --> 53:55.496
- Life.
- Life, English.

54:08.478 --> 54:10.810
Don't start the war without me.

54:23.193 --> 54:24.490
Bye!

54:25.695 --> 54:27.424
Bye-bye.

54:59.195 --> 55:00.423
Thanks.

55:04.434 --> 55:07.164
You don't know how much you mean to me.

55:11.975 --> 55:13.966
I've missed you so much.

55:19.783 --> 55:22.251
But I'm still jealous of your jungle
and your headhunters.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.650
It's not fair, you having all the fun.

55:23.720 --> 55:25.984
Fun? You think that's fun?

55:26.056 --> 55:27.853
I suppose you still think you're Tarzan,
do you?

55:27.924 --> 55:31.155
And you think you're Lawrence of Arabia,
I'm sure.

55:32.696 --> 55:35.062
- All right, say a prayer.
- Right.

55:38.368 --> 55:40.563
Now, what about these savages?

55:40.637 --> 55:43.401
This whole thing, you've really done it.

55:44.307 --> 55:46.275
You know, the first time you radioed in...

55:46.343 --> 55:47.867
Ferguson thought you'd landed
on your head.

55:47.944 --> 55:50.139
That's not far from the truth.
He doesn't think that now, does he?

55:50.213 --> 55:54.673
Oh, no, he's very proud of you.
But this so-called King, it disturbs him.

55:55.185 --> 55:58.120
- What's he like?
- He is a king, a real king.

55:58.221 --> 55:59.688
Is he yours?

56:06.396 --> 56:07.886
Hitler's dead.

56:09.032 --> 56:12.263
The war in Europe's over.
We heard it yesterday.

56:12.836 --> 56:14.428
How do you feel?

56:14.938 --> 56:16.838
How do you feel, really?

56:17.040 --> 56:21.477
You've done a hell of a piece of soldiering,
but that's beside the point.

56:22.879 --> 56:26.280
If your American believes he's a king,
then he's mad.

56:27.684 --> 56:30.482
And if you believe his fantasy,
then you're mad.

56:30.653 --> 56:34.145
- Worse things have happened, sir.
- Yes, yes, they have.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.455
Vivienne's like a daughter...

56:42.232 --> 56:44.393
and you're like a son to me.

56:45.702 --> 56:47.329
Do you know
how many sons I have trained...

56:47.404 --> 56:51.067
and dropped in some godforsaken jungle
never to come back?

56:52.709 --> 56:55.678
Show me that respect, or at least pretend to.

56:58.448 --> 57:00.712
Tell me about these Comanches.

57:01.451 --> 57:04.181
Well, sir, there are about 600 of them.

57:05.955 --> 57:09.721
And they fight of their own free will,
depending on their mood.

57:09.793 --> 57:11.522
- Mood?
- Yes.

57:12.395 --> 57:16.593
Sometimes an entire militia
can just march off in a fit of nostalgia...

57:17.567 --> 57:19.797
to visit some ancient valley.

57:20.970 --> 57:22.403
It makes perfect sense if you're out there.

57:22.472 --> 57:24.201
It's very hard to understand if you're not.

57:24.274 --> 57:26.606
Yes, yes. So?

57:29.279 --> 57:32.305
- An army after my own heart, sir.
- Oh, stop it.

57:42.225 --> 57:44.853
You can build them roads and bridges.

57:45.428 --> 57:48.727
You can love their women,
sire their children even.

57:49.899 --> 57:53.096
You could learn from them.
My God, you can learn.

57:54.337 --> 57:56.635
But you've got to stay British.

57:58.007 --> 58:01.738
It's not contempt. It's a line of conduct.

58:02.979 --> 58:05.140
You'll never be one of them.

58:07.050 --> 58:09.518
You're no longer one of us, either.

58:10.286 --> 58:13.653
People never see you the same again.
A dead leaf.

58:23.700 --> 58:27.431
You know that one fine day,
you're gonna have to betray them.

58:29.672 --> 58:32.197
It happened to you, sir, didn't it?

58:34.511 --> 58:36.638
You've got to stay British.

58:40.617 --> 58:41.948
What was it, sir?

58:45.321 --> 58:47.448
For me, it was only a girl.

58:47.924 --> 58:50.051
But I saw India through her.

58:51.127 --> 58:55.496
I saw things that very few white men,
or any men for that matter, will ever see.

58:58.401 --> 59:00.062
I loved the East.

59:01.004 --> 59:03.131
Never the same again.

59:05.208 --> 59:09.042
But it was only a girl. I was no king.

59:09.479 --> 59:11.743
Then we have to put it to MacArthur.

59:11.848 --> 59:13.213
How do you know he was here?

59:13.283 --> 59:16.844
I told him he was here
to observe the landings at Brunei.

59:18.922 --> 59:21.755
Well, it seems like it's out of my hands.

59:22.358 --> 59:26.454
Which is just as well,
because I don't really want it on my hands.

59:43.746 --> 59:45.714
General Sutherland, sir!

59:55.625 --> 59:59.288
This is General Sutherland,
the supreme commander's Chief of Staff.

59:59.696 --> 01:00:02.563
Colonel Ferguson, sir.
Combined Special Operations.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.031
Cloak and dagger, huh?

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.335
Well, I'm sorry to say, Colonel,
that the General...

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:13.273
just doesn't have any time right now
for kings or treaties with mythical empires.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:17.236
Although I will say
it's certainly entertaining and romantic.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:20.544
- Are you the fellas who've got the King?
- Yes, sir! We do!

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.210
- Well, Dick?
- Yes, sir!

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:26.817
- Bring them in.
- Yes, sir!

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.461
King?

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.438
- Yes, sir.
- What does he want?

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.142
Well, sir, he wants freedom.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:55.043
- That's what we all want, isn't it?
- Freedom for his people, sir.

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:58.618
And a guarantee they can remain
as they are.

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:03.357
He wants an Allied promise
to protect that right, sir.

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.692
Any papers? There are always papers.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:11.131
Oh, yes, yes, I've got them, right here.

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.195
- I had a treaty drawn up.
- Sir!

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:18.670
You don't have to listen
to any more of this nonsense, sir.

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:23.468
This isn't nonsense, Dick. This is history.

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:27.877
History is written by unusual men.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.349
Some who even become kings...

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:34.888
and some who make no more mark
than that of a stone thrown into an ocean.

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.584
What we have here...

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:42.121
Well, we just don't know, do we?

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:58.745
But, Captain, if you say he's a king,
then I'll go along with it.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:01.575
I'll sign these treaties...

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:04.484
as Supreme Allied Commander
of the Pacific Forces.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:06.983
And if your king were here...

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:10.253
I'd kneel before him and offer him my sword.

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.657
If I had a sword.

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:14.527
Have copies made.

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:18.329
Handle this as you would dealings
with any other sovereign.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.460
Your copies will be returned
in the morning, Captain.

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:23.300
Right. As a matter of fact, sir,
I've got some copies here.

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:25.567
- You do, do you? Yes, you would.
- Yes.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:38.884
Thank you, sir.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.286
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.585
It's nothing.

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:45.684
Besides, you wouldn't leave until I signed,
would you?

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:47.888
Captain...

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.863
you remind me of myself.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:53.897
Thank you very much, sir.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:57.097
And let me know how things go
in the kingdom.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:02:59.563
Good day.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.614
I can't believe it.

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:11.517
- He's incredible!
- He's just a man like any other.

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:14.713
It will never be done.
He'll never have to think of it again.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.658
History will wash his hands, not yours.

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.136
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thank you.

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:04.731
You've landed in an uproar, sir. You'll see.

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:08.743
- How's Miss Vivienne and the old man, sir?
- She's fine, Tenga. She's just fine.

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:10.836
- A present from Morotai.
- Thank you, sir!

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.904
- Did you miss me?
- Of course, sir!

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.574
Things weren't the same.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.881
Sergeant Conklin got in a terrible row
with his wives, sir.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:18.943
Wives?

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.322
- Life, English!
- Life!

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.052
- Life, English!
- What is this?

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:27.118
- Refugees, sir. More come every day.
- Life, English!

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:31.292
There's been an uprising on the coast.
Japanese have been quite brutal, sir.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.867
Captain, how was your trip?

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.834
There's no controlling him, sir.

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:45.642
I've been away for three days,
and you're acting like schoolchildren!

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.491
I guess I owe you more than I can say.

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.685
But don't be fooled. It's only a bit of paper.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.456
They've broken a treaty or two before,
you know.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:41.060
No, no, no, it's you. You did this for me.

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:46.064
Not MacArthur
and not your Special Forces...

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:49.111
or the Allies,
or your whole goddamn empire!

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.805
You did this for me!

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.113
The King and the country.

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.582
Now go to sleep.

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:04.421
Life, English.

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:07.522
Life, Rajah.

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.913
So this is the Pass of the Clouds?

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.250
I said I'd show you someday.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:38.919
- Gold? Jewels?
- No, something beyond all that crap.

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:51.534
The Pass of the Clouds.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:57.503
There! There, there! There are the Punans.
They're called the honey gatherers.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.707
We call it Valley of the Children.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.914
- They're Stone Age!
- Yes.

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:11.352
They don't know of possessions.
They have no word for jealousy or greed.

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:14.419
It's absolutely amazing. Incredible, isn't it?

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:20.863
Why do you bring us here?

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:26.373
If you follow the gorge of the Padas River
and the coastal mountains, you end up here.

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:29.240
Go through their caves
and our whole valley is at your feet.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:30.710
And you're afraid the Japs might...

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.079
The Japs? I'm not afraid of the Japs.
I'm not afraid of anybody!

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:37.211
I want you to rig their caves with dynamite.

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:40.949
And if something happens, we blow it.

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:43.116
They could still come through the jungle,
like you did.

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.126
No one would want it that bad.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:49.160
We control the jungle. It's here. Dynamite!

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:54.100
- So no one will get in ever.
- So it'll be here for all of us.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:56.764
Spoken like a free man.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:09.584
<i>So ended our days of peace.</i>

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:11.882
<i>Perhaps some of the happiest of my life.</i>

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.923
<i>And with a northwesterly monsoon</i>
<i>gathering before us...</i>

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.924
<i>came our days of war.</i>

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:47.120
<i>The death agony of the Japanese army</i>
<i>in Borneo...</i>

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.953
<i>was as sad as the sinking of a great ship.</i>

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:53.461
<i>Bullets, explosives, poisoned arrows.</i>

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:57.055
<i>Men stumbling through the night,</i>
<i>mumbling incoherently.</i>

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.464
<i>Hunger.</i>

01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:02.402
<i>Men eating weeds, leeches, insects...</i>

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.337
<i>and each other.</i>

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:07.541
<i>Despair, madness.</i>

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.471
<i>For me, for us...</i>

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:13.777
<i>the same period was as thrilling</i>
<i>as a cavalry charge.</i>

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:15.107
<i>May God forgive us.</i>

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.310
Fire!

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:10.001
Advance the colors!

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:22.441
Company, double time!

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.410
What's he got there?

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.254
What do you think?

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:06.959
- It's a regression. Barbaric!
- Come on, sir. It's good for the longhouse.

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:10.127
Besides, it's also an accurate way
to keep count.

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.941
The war is getting closer.

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:27.546
They've slipped
through the whole Ninth Division.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:30.016
From the beginning,
the Nip has moved with a purpose.

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:33.816
Here from Tarakan,
up this gorge in the Crocker Range.

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:37.552
But that's not our concern.
Our concern is more immediate.

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.092
The phantom column.

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.289
- The phantom Colonel.
- That's right.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.389
These have chosen not to die.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.331
They fight like Genghis Khan.

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:49.098
Destroy everything in their path,
no prisoners.

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.436
Still wear full uniforms, weapons.

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:54.970
They even seem well-fed.

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.542
And they move as fast as we do.

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.478
- How?
- I don't know, sir.

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:03.009
But we'll know soon enough.
They're coming our way.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:07.349
They say the Colonel,
a phantom Colonel, rides a horse.

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:08.481
A horse?

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.555
- A white horse?
- I don't know, sir.

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:15.053
They seem to be going from here to...
What's this pass called?

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.597
Pass of the Clouds.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.558
Pass of the Clouds.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.207
It is the time of fear.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.847
The southwesterly wind brings death.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.447
It is the wind of the flies.

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.786
- Who says that?
- Gwai.

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:47.854
He says that it will end
when the northwesterly wind returns.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.697
- Everything ends.
- Yes.

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:54.167
Everything ends. Even me.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.399
Don't let this wind come here to us...

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.268
to our people.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.674
Forget this war.

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.636
This war is for evil men.

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.509
Send these others on.

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:10.945
Let them have the wind of the flies.

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:14.011
The wind is too strong.
The trees cannot stand in the wind.

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:17.718
I must hold them up.
It is the only good thing men can do.

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.292
Men dream.

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.019
Yes.

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.310
You'll be here to try.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.855
But he is a stranger. He's not one of you.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:13.539
- What'd she say?
- She says she wants to be just like you.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:16.448
No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:19.510
You must not be like me.
You must be much, much more.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:20.748
Not like me.

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.845
They're an hour ahead.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.822
They killed everyone here, didn't they?

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:57.876
God!

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.692
What is it, Tenga?

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.090
We know where they are, sir.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.265
What do you mean?

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:17.229
They're dead, sir. They're all dead, sir!

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.837
They've been massacred, sir!

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.105
I found bones.

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:25.613
Just bones, sir.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:28.343
- What are you saying, Tenga?
- They're eating the dead!

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:32.080
- They ain't starving.
- Cannibals! That's what he's saying.

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:35.915
That's how they're living.
That's what they're after.

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:40.690
Then we must destroy them,
every one of them, my God!

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:42.655
Every one.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:45.693
No quarter asked or given.

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.077
All right, get down!

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:26.918
Get up, for me!

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:00.818
Get him off it.

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.450
Shit, he's caught on a bayonet, mate.

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:07.656
They've gone.

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:11.427
- We've got to get to the longhouse!
- They've gone.

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:14.957
They've gone to the Pass,
the Pass of the Clouds. I feel it. I know it.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.027
We've got to blow the Pass.
They're going to...

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:20.006
They've killed everyone!
Everyone's dead. My whole crew.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:22.976
- They can march much faster than we can.
- We've got to be there by noon.

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.535
Let's put what's left of the army
between them and the longhouse.

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:27.479
- You should back off!
- Listen to me!

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.948
They've broken through!

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:31.144
We've got to get to the longhouse!

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:01.106
Blow it!

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.946
Get them out! Go! Go! Come on!

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.591
Blow it!

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:26.371
Get out of here! Damn it!

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.342
- Blow the son of a bitch!
- Get the hell out of here!

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:32.237
You don't understand! You have to go!

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:34.782
You want me to throw rocks?
Is that what you want? All right!

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:37.147
Get out of here! Scram!

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.516
Go on, move! Scram!

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:40.713
Vamoose!

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.961
The longhouse!
We've got to get to the longhouse!

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.834
There's nothing you can do!

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:13.982
Come on! We've lost time!

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.530
Gwai!

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:14.785
Conklin's got them spotted in a gorge
in the Srai by Falcon's Peak.

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:18.792
We can hold them there till morning,
and then call in for the Air Force.

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:23.497
Vengeance is futile. It never ends.
You told me that.

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:28.001
It's not man that counts, it's life, Learoyd.
It's life!

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:30.094
Blood must be answered by blood.

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:30.045
Come on.

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:59.378
Learoyd am I!

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:04.551
Bastards!

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:40.878
Rajah.

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:44.919
Why are they doing that?

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:48.585
Showing me their bravery, suffering.

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:51.288
But I've seen enough.

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.699
It's all gone...

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:59.899
all I had in this world.
None of it will bring them back.

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:02.841
They're gone for tomorrow,
the day after, forever.

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:07.410
What day is it?

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:13.283
What day is it?

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:16.621
It's August the 6th.

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:19.518
What year?

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:23.624
August the 6th, 1945.

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:26.266
It's around 8:00.

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:33.167
From this day, from this time on...

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.004
I'll never raise my hand
against another man.

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:53.687
<i>I went on to pursue the Japanese Colonel...</i>

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:56.389
<i>who, like the phantom he was, had escaped.</i>

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:07.101
<i>All Allied Armed Forces, Pacific Theater...</i>

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:12.009
<i>all Allied Forces, China, Burma, India...</i>

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.240
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.813
<i>The world will note</i>
<i>that the first atomic bomb...</i>

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:20.342
<i>was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.</i>

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:24.584
<i>We won the race of discovery</i>
<i>against the Germans.</i>

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:27.822
<i>We have used it</i>
<i>in order to shorten the agony of war...</i>

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:32.059
<i>in order to save the lives of thousands</i>
<i>and thousands of young Americans.</i>

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.897
<i>We shall continue to use it...</i>

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:38.735
<i>until we completely destroy</i>
<i>Japan's power to make war...</i>

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:14.627
Learoyd.

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.248
Learoyd.

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:02.440
Vivienne.

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.314
- Vivienne?
- Yes.

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:08.079
I'm awake.

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:14.784
- Have I been awake before?
- I thought so. Every day for a little while.

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:19.427
Where are we?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.264
What's happened?
How long have I been here?

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:25.533
You're in Brunei,
and you've been here almost three weeks.

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:29.998
The war.

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.039
What about...

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:33.838
The war is over.

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:53.182
"Leave us alone, and we'll leave you alone."

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:55.922
It's simple.

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:57.524
Eloquent.

01:38:57.598 --> 01:39:01.762
It's great stuff! Conrad! Kipling!
The days of high adventure!

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:05.135
Lord Learoyd, the Rajah Rayah!

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:10.134
An Aussie patrol was shot up yesterday.
Men have died.

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:12.644
You made a deal, signed a treaty.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.775
MacArthur signed it. I wouldn't.

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:18.443
They are not gonna tolerate any kings
running around in the hills.

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.483
He'll never come down, sir.

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:23.283
He won't toe the line.

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:26.658
He will, poor devil, one way or another.

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:31.797
Vivienne, would you get me
some of that iced tea?

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:35.492
Why, yes, of course.

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.867
- Nigel?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:46.004
No one moves very far out of line.

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:50.115
When you're young,
you think you're blazing a trail.

01:39:50.684 --> 01:39:53.653
One day you look down
and notice it's a beaten track.

01:40:04.064 --> 01:40:06.089
- That's my map, sir.
- Exactly.

01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:13.104
What's this place?

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.104
Pass of the Clouds?

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:18.505
It's nothing.

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:20.607
Just a pass, that's all.

01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:22.404
Why?

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:26.311
Division wants to put
a blocking force in there.

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:29.117
Send up a battery of 105 mm howitzers.

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:32.992
Blast him to oblivion wherever he goes.

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:35.826
Yes, it won't cost them anything.

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:39.696
They have quite a few extra
105 mm shells at the end of a war.

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:51.169
- It's not my plan, but...
- You won't have to.

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:53.935
Why?

01:40:56.183 --> 01:40:57.172
Salt.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.709
Yes?

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:02.618
They need salt.

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:05.589
They get it from the sea.

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:09.686
If you cut off their supply of salt,
the revolt will die within weeks.

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.564
- No bloodshed.
- Salt.

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.825
It's so simple.

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:19.298
What is life without a little salt?

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:27.480
Ice! How marvelous! Thank you, Vivienne.

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.312
Are you feeling all right?

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.314
Did Judas feel all right?

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:40.251
I'm sorry, Vivienne. It had to be.

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:46.058
You're so lucky to have each other.

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.463
Most of us have nothing.

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:52.566
Take something decent
out of this wretched war.

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:55.340
Somebody ought to.

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.180
We mountain people.

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:43.823
We come in peace.

01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:46.990
Just who might you be, fella?

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:51.623
He Rajah.

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:53.894
King Learoyd.

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:03.500
- You know who I am.
- Yeah.

01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:06.811
And what do you think you're doing here?

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:09.512
These are the forest people.

01:43:10.617 --> 01:43:14.519
- They need salt.
- Salt, eh? I heard that.

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:17.587
What are you gonna give me for it?

01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:19.023
You can have me...

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:21.892
Sergeant Conklin...

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.128
Colonel Mitamura.

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:28.134
But the others, they're free.

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:33.773
And what if I don't buy this arrangement?

01:44:11.912 --> 01:44:14.380
Yeah, don't cry, little one.

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:15.972
Don't cry.

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:20.409
I'll be with you in the songs they sing
in the longhouses.

01:44:20.887 --> 01:44:24.050
And then when you're older
and you have children...

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:26.319
well, you'll sing the songs to them.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.060
And then they'll sing to their children.

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:30.860
And the songs...

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:33.792
The songs will make you strong.

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:36.459
And you won't need me, anymore.

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:51.039
Okay?

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.108
Who did this?

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:58.276
He refused to speak, sir, like now.

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:02.448
The men gave him a bit of a pasting.

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:05.181
After all, sir, he is a deserter.

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:08.352
You're a disgrace to the Army!
You'll be stripped!

01:46:13.767 --> 01:46:15.792
I didn't want it to be this way.

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.093
It ends up shabbily.

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:20.303
It always does.

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:23.968
I'm sorry.

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:31.874
<i>I was never to see Borneo again.</i>

01:46:32.486 --> 01:46:35.011
<i>The wind from the sea</i>
<i>would carry me home.</i>

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:38.252
<i>Somehow, I managed to go with Learoyd.</i>

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:41.920
<i>He was in the prison hold,</i>
<i>while I had a room to myself.</i>

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:45.590
<i>He was to stand court-martial</i>
<i>in Manila for desertion...</i>

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:48.327
<i>while I was a major with a DSO.</i>

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:50.134
<i>Easy stages.</i>

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:53.704
<i>And then,</i>
<i>somewhere near the straits of Mindanao...</i>

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.549
- What's the matter, sailor?
- We've run aground, sir!

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:26.137
- Where's the prisoner kept?
- In the hold.

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:38.040
- Get forward! We've run aground!
- Aye, sir!

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.282
Aye, aye, sir.

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:42.580
Who's in charge here?

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:45.022
- Where's the prisoner?
- Over there, sir.

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:52.888
- Prisoner! You're coming with me! Come on!
- Yeah, but why have we stopped?

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:55.994
This way! Quick!

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:00.037
In there, quickly!

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:04.603
Get forward, sailor! We've run aground!

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:06.839
What are you staring at? Get going!

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:09.639
Come on!

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:12.611
Keep going!

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:14.976
Go on!

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:19.854
- Now turn around and give me those.
- I thought it was you.

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:24.520
- How well do you swim?
- Well enough.

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:27.032
- They'll take away your DSO.
- They've already given it to me.

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.830
Besides, with a bit of luck,
they'll never know.

01:48:30.303 --> 01:48:31.930
Why are you doing this?

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.296
For King and country!

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:38.036
God bless. Now get going!

01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:39.940
Life, English!

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.450
Life, Rajah.

01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:46.274
