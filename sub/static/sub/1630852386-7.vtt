WEBVTT

00:32.741 --> 00:37.454
Okay, so you take 35,
multiply by 1.8 and add 30?

00:37.537 --> 00:38.788
Thirty-two.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.041
Can you please change your phone
back to Fahrenheit?

00:41.124 --> 00:42.250
I want to learn.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.377
Oh, my God, it's 95 out there.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.546
It feels like 195 in here.

00:48.465 --> 00:52.510
Uh, so you're going to add more heat?
Why don't you open the oven and cook us?

00:52.594 --> 00:54.304
Relax, it's on the cool setting.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.140
Ah.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.933


00:59.017 --> 01:01.311
I will never take air conditioning
for granted again.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.520
I've got to buy a fan.

01:02.604 --> 01:06.107
The least we can do is push this stank
from one side of the room to the other.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.192


01:07.275 --> 01:11.654
I'm going to go to the office early
because maybe it'll be cooler in there.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.864
Blow for the road?

01:14.866 --> 01:15.700


01:22.582 --> 01:24.084
Ooh, new menu already?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.835
It's a new menu every day.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.004
Every day? That is so much work.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.423
It has to reflect
the quality of what's in season.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.674
We're not a diner, Emily.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.301
I know.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.846
Ooh, we should post this to
Chez Lavaux's Instagram account each day.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.348
Fresh produce, fresh content.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.225
Ah. I've taught you so much.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.060


01:42.811 --> 01:45.271
Wait. Where are those
delicious grilled ramps?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.272
Wilted.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.192
But I just posted
about that plate this morning!

01:49.275 --> 01:51.236
#rampedupforweek2.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.320
What can I say, Emily?

01:52.403 --> 01:56.449
You don't expect me to serve something
past its expiration date, do you?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.036
Of course not.
That would be so last-season of you.

02:00.703 --> 02:01.621
Have a good day.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.639
It's like a sauna in here.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.184
Can we turn up
the air conditioning or… on?

02:23.268 --> 02:24.978
We don't have air conditioning.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.146
We don't?

02:26.229 --> 02:27.939
It's not common in Paris.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.692
It's so unnatural, artificial…

02:30.775 --> 02:32.443
American.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.613
-It's better than sweating at your desk.
-No, it's bad for you.

02:36.114 --> 02:40.201
It makes you catch colds.
We're meant to feel the seasons change.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.287
Can't you accept nature, Emily?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.414
Must you control everything?

02:49.878 --> 02:50.712
Mosquito.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.672
<i>Now I'm at six months,</i>

02:52.755 --> 02:57.802
<i>I'm meant to sleep on my side,</i>
<i>but I can't sleep at all.</i>

02:57.886 --> 03:00.722
But at least being awake
means I get to talk to you.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.265
Lucky me.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.475
But we can
speak English if it's easier.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.435
<i>Oh, no.</i>

03:05.518 --> 03:08.021
<i>I like practicing with you.</i>

03:08.104 --> 03:11.482
<i>I studied the French for years.</i>

03:11.566 --> 03:15.987
<i>It has always been my dream</i>
<i>to work in Paris.</i>

03:16.571 --> 03:19.782
<i>If it wasn't for</i>
<i>this damn baby, I'd be there.</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:21.159
Is that Mad Mad Madeline?

03:21.242 --> 03:23.995
<i>Oh my God,</i>
<i>Emily Cooper in the house!</i>

03:24.078 --> 03:26.331
<i>-Show me that girl!</i>
-Ah!

03:26.915 --> 03:28.458
<i>Bonjour,</i> Windy City.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.877
Well, unless there is anything else…

03:30.960 --> 03:34.088
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>
<i>I've got the really, really big news.</i>

03:34.172 --> 03:37.508
<i>We are promoting</i>
<i>Pelotech's international roll-out.</i>

03:38.092 --> 03:40.887
<i>-And guess what their next stop is?</i>

03:41.429 --> 03:43.431
-France?
-<i>That's right!</i>

03:43.514 --> 03:46.601
<i>And they're</i> très <i>thrilled</i>
<i>to hear about our French office.</i>

03:46.684 --> 03:47.644
<i>I love saying that.</i>

03:47.727 --> 03:51.522
Oh, my God! I cannot believe
that we're launching Pelotech in Paris!

03:51.606 --> 03:52.649
Tell me everything.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.443
<i>So I'll start at the beginning</i>
<i>because it's so juicy…</i>

04:11.542 --> 04:12.794
Le Chef Hot?

04:12.877 --> 04:14.087
Excuse me?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.755
That's your chef smile.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.298
No it's not.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.437
Next to no tips today.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.399
At least we scored free falafel
from that food truck.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.109
No, it wasn't us.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.944
Extreme weather
always means smaller crowds.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.781
I sang "All By Myself"
to literally myself.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.992
That's not true. I was listening.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.840
What is that song?

04:58.923 --> 05:01.676
Something I'm working on. It's nothing.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.344
That's beautiful.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.472
-I didn't know you composed music.
-Yeah, I do.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.474
Or used to.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.520
I even went to music school,
but I didn't finish.

05:12.603 --> 05:16.024
My favorite teacher told me
to stop trying to write songs.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.985
It kind of crushed my confidence.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.070
So I dropped out.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.116
Then, all of a sudden,
just recently, I started writing again.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.951
What happened?

05:29.245 --> 05:30.830
You happened.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.083
Yeah, since you joined the band,

05:35.126 --> 05:39.380
I've been feeling very inspired.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.178
Oh…

05:45.720 --> 05:47.096
-Should I not have?
-No.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.308
I mean, yes. No, I wanted you to kiss me.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.518
But I have falafel breath.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.939
I don't care. I do too.
We cancel each other out.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.316
Okay, great.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.290
Hold up!

06:14.374 --> 06:16.084
There you go.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.293
Ooh! Coffee, good idea.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.253
-It's a traveler, Cooper.
-Mmm-hmm!

06:19.796 --> 06:21.631
-Oh, that's beer!

06:21.714 --> 06:23.549
-What did you call it?
-A traveler.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.052
To drink whilst you're traveling
to the next bar.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.845
Or French class.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.597
You know, one thing I'll give ol' Paris,

06:29.680 --> 06:33.101
open container laws mean
you can get on the lash whenever you want.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.602
I don't think that's true.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.312
Well, I haven't been nicked yet.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.272
Maybe tonight's the night.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.691
Fancy getting banged up abroad, Cooper?

06:40.775 --> 06:44.028
You know, the more you drink,
the more British you sound.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.113
Are you sure

06:45.196 --> 06:47.407
-we're not too drunk for French class?
-Mmm.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.533
Should we skip it?

06:49.450 --> 06:52.662
Can't. Need to get
my little attendance slip signed for work.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.416
Don't worry, love. We'll be hunky-dory.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.126
Hunky-dory?

06:58.209 --> 07:00.128
Oh, now you're just taking the piss.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.712
-Mmm-hmm.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.005
I'm a fast learner.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.731
I hope you both find your grades as funny.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.074
Alfie, can you join me
at the board, please.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.455
So, one common mistake in the test

07:35.538 --> 07:38.833
was people using <i>"je suppose"</i>
instead of <i>"j'imagine."</i>

07:38.916 --> 07:42.336
They're very similar,
but <i>"j'imagine"</i> is more abstract.

07:42.420 --> 07:47.633
Alfie, can you write on the board, please,
<i>"J'imagine que je suis en vacances."</i>

08:04.108 --> 08:05.943
What was the rest?

08:06.027 --> 08:08.070
No, not Jean Magine.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.030
<i>J'imagine.</i>

08:09.614 --> 08:12.074
-That's what I wrote.
-No.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.784
Who the hell's Jean Magine, anyway?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.411
In French, please.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.497
<i>Qui est Jean Magine?</i>

08:20.917 --> 08:23.169
I imagine
Alfie's doing his best.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.339
He doesn't have much opportunity
to speak with many French people.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.966
Now that
was bloody brilliant!

08:30.885 --> 08:31.761
What did she say?

08:40.061 --> 08:40.937
Emily.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.149
Well done. Tonight for the first time,

08:45.233 --> 08:48.486
you fully immersed yourself
in the language.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.530
You didn't overthink it.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.282
<i>Merci.</i> I don't know, really,
what came over me,

08:53.366 --> 08:54.867
but maybe it's the heatwave.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.078
Yeah, or whatever's in that cup.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.081
Alfie, I wish I could say the same to you.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.416
All good. Not bothered.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.544
I didn't think so. Hmm.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.170
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

09:07.088 --> 09:10.174
She is so into me.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.188
Yeah.
That fan did absolutely nothing.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.357
I can't wait to get home.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.652
Get out of this suit
and just stand in front of my AC.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.905
Ugh, I wish I had AC.
My building is so ancient.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.121
Well, you could come back to mine.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.039
If you'd like.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.875
I mean, if you need to cool down.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.252
Fine.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.589
But just like, you know,
for the air conditioning.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.673
Mmm!

09:51.841 --> 09:52.925
Where do you live?

10:06.647 --> 10:07.481
Mmm.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.277
I didn't know
people actually lived in La Défense.

10:11.902 --> 10:15.489
I thought it was just business offices,
board rooms and…

10:15.573 --> 10:16.866
Banks.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.998
I work in that one right there.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.834
So my company put me up here, nearby.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.629
No wonder you don't like Paris.

10:30.379 --> 10:34.258
You're not in it. This is Pittsburgh!

10:34.342 --> 10:35.426
Pittsburgh.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.095
Hmm.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.890
Who are these cuties?

10:40.973 --> 10:42.141
They came with the frame.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.518
-Ha-ha.
-I'm not joking.

10:46.854 --> 10:50.483
I mean, you could
do with a little color in here.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.818
Or life.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.153
Yeah. About that.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.822
I've been meaning to tell you something.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.282
See, I'm not a banker.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.034
I'm a spy.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.748
I knew there was something strange
about your job.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.959
-I mean, is Alfie even your real name?
-Mmm-mmm.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.086
Hmm.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.253
Can I trust you?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.047
I'm very discreet.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.217
-And you promise not to laugh?
-Promise.

11:16.884 --> 11:17.760
It's…

11:18.678 --> 11:20.346
-Judi Dench.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.473
-Hey, you promised.
-I'm sorry.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.351
Okay, truly. I won't tell a soul.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.977
-All right.
-Judi.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.484
Well, I wish I was a spy.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.611
But I'm not.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.988
I'm just a boring banker,

11:38.072 --> 11:41.242
with a boring job, in a boring apartment.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.495
Stuck in a city
where no one can understand a word I say.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.914
Then why did you come here?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.083
Not my choice.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.210
I mean, someone
from the London office had to.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.088
Everyone else is partnered up,
married, kids.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.716
But marketing…

11:57.925 --> 11:59.176
now that's a cool job.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.386
It can be.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.514
But it's not all parties on love boats.

12:03.597 --> 12:04.974
Oh, sure.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.809
What were you doing last week

12:06.892 --> 12:09.145
when you were too busy
to have a drink with me?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.104
Uh…

12:10.771 --> 12:15.025
We were busy promoting the opening
of a restaurant near my apartment.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.027
-Which one?
-Chez Lavaux.

12:17.111 --> 12:17.945
See?

12:18.946 --> 12:20.197
A restaurant opening.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.283
That's cool.

12:23.325 --> 12:27.163
I mean, your life in Paris is
far more interesting than mine.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.083
I still can't tell
if you're joking or not.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.046
See, I don't joke about everything.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.637
I get serious about things I like.

12:44.805 --> 12:45.806
Oh, really?

12:46.348 --> 12:47.391
Mmm.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.519
Like what?

12:50.603 --> 12:51.604
Like…

12:54.815 --> 12:55.816
you.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.258
In the back.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.389
No, no.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.768
Okay.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.104
-Just rip it.
-What? Okay.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.816
Are you pulling a Houdini?

14:20.067 --> 14:22.528
If that means sneaking out, yes.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.614
But, I need to borrow a getaway shirt.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.782
Take whatever.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.706
Last night was fun, Cooper.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.333
It was.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.170
You're not leaving without a kiss goodbye?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.721
Goodbye.

14:48.804 --> 14:49.763
Mmm-mmm.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.848
See you soon.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.808
Wow.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.268
You do know some French.

15:22.963 --> 15:23.964
Emily.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.592
Good morning.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.219
Or is it still night for you?

15:29.803 --> 15:32.681
Uh, where are you off to, early bird?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.309
Marché Bastille,
you have to be there at 7:00

15:35.392 --> 15:37.102
-for the best produce.
-Hmm.

15:37.186 --> 15:41.231
Where are you coming from,
wearing a man's jacket?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.232
Huh?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.026
This, no! This is mine.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.862
The oversized power suit look
is very in right now.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.155
Oh.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.740
Enjoy the market!

16:04.213 --> 16:06.632
That's what we really like
to go for here at Pelotech.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.676
From what our research tells us,

16:08.759 --> 16:11.345
exercise is more like a pastime in France.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.888
Not a lifestyle.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.766
We at Pelotech
intend to shift that mentality.

16:15.849 --> 16:19.311
One pedal stroke at a time.
And we'll do it with this.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.730
A heart-pumping cardio experience

16:21.814 --> 16:24.525
that connects riders
to a world-wide fitness community.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.610
You can ride at the same time
as your friends.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.321
Post your stats to social,
share high fives,

16:29.405 --> 16:32.116
even video chat
while you get your sweat on.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.326
I'd prefer
to ride a bike into the Seine.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.079
Why would anyone want this
when you can ride outside?

16:37.162 --> 16:39.623
Huh? You don't go anywhere.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.334
Sorry, but I don't
understand a word of French.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.919
Wish my Spanish worked over here.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.381
Can you please repeat what you said.
All I caught was "La Seine."

16:47.464 --> 16:49.717
Huh? <i>Excusez-moi,</i> I no speak English.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.096
Lucky we have our Chicago transplant here.
Emily, mind being my interpreter?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.140
Yeah. Sure.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.059
Sylvie said…

17:00.352 --> 17:02.354
for Pelotech's launch,

17:02.438 --> 17:06.108
we should stage bikes
along the Seine for people to try.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.193
Love that idea, Silvia.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.865
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Ready to ride Pelotech?</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:15.868
I guess
we work for America now.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.828
The French market
is so important to us.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.538
Once the user logs in,

17:19.621 --> 17:22.791
they can join a live ride
taking place at our New York studio

17:22.875 --> 17:26.795
or access our massive database
of prerecorded classes.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.672
They can track their progress…

17:51.070 --> 17:52.780
So, did you get a fan for your apartment?

17:52.863 --> 17:54.156
No, still hunting.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.659
Every store I try is sold out.
Oh, my God, thank you.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.747
What shall we play first?
I was thinking Sia's "Chandelier."

18:01.830 --> 18:04.333
Oh, I love that song.
Do you know it, Mindy?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.710
Yeah. Do you know it, Mindy?

18:06.794 --> 18:09.296
I feel like I've heard you
sing it somewhere before.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.341
No, no, I don't think so.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.136
It could have been someone else.
Maybe I should just zip it.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.101
I'm sure I could
stumble my way through it.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.103
Great. I'll set up the mics.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.105
Okay, what do you know?

18:26.188 --> 18:29.691
Just that you are famous
and, like, rich, rich.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.609
Okay.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.194
I didn't see you on <i>Chinese Pop Star,</i>

18:32.277 --> 18:36.448
but when I sent a picture of our band
to my cousin in Shanghai,

18:36.532 --> 18:37.658
she died.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.326
Okay, great, yeah. Okay.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.788
Étienne, can we please
maybe just keep this between us?

18:42.871 --> 18:44.998
I'm trying to reinvent myself
here in Paris.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.334
Why don't you want to tell Benoît?

18:47.417 --> 18:52.047
Well, we're new and history has proven
that when people find out I'm…

18:52.131 --> 18:53.924
The zipper princess of China?

18:54.007 --> 18:55.467
Right. That.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.928
Sometimes things get weird.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.817


19:13.235 --> 19:16.780
<i>Hey, it's Alfie.</i>
<i>Who leaves voicemails anymore? Beep.</i>

19:16.864 --> 19:18.866
-Hey, Alfie. I--
<i>-Gotcha!</i>

19:19.408 --> 19:20.909
<i>That was just me beeping.</i>

19:20.993 --> 19:22.035
<i>Here's the real one.</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:25.747
You got me! That is so you!

19:25.831 --> 19:31.420
Um, hey, it's… It's me, Emily.
Emily Cooper from French class.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.756
Yeah. You knew all that already.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.719
Anyway. Um, wow,
that beep trick really threw me.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.805
-Um, I was calling about your jacket and--

19:41.889 --> 19:44.683
<i>If you're</i>
<i>satisfied with your message, press 1.</i>

19:44.766 --> 19:46.643
<i>To re-record, press three.</i>

19:47.477 --> 19:48.937
Three. Definitely three.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.106
Ooh. That sounded desperate.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.525
It was. I met someone and we--

19:54.276 --> 19:55.527
Please spare me the details.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.237
Happily.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.199
The point is since then,
he's stopped responding to my texts.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.408
That's bad, right?

20:01.491 --> 20:05.412
Well, if it's been more than 24 hours,
then he's not into you.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.956
Or, you should file
a missing person's report.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.960
The great outdoors.

20:12.044 --> 20:17.090
See, Emily? This is how we ride in Paris.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.847
Watch where
you're going, lunatic!

20:23.931 --> 20:25.849
You watch where you're going, asshole!

20:25.933 --> 20:27.809
Shut up!

20:38.487 --> 20:40.822
Oh, thank you.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.408
Ah!

20:43.492 --> 20:46.703
Okay, well, it's official.
Alfie is a jerk.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.582
Are you sure he's ghosted you?
I mean, it hasn't been that long.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.335
Girl, I have texted him so many times.

20:54.086 --> 20:54.920
How many?

20:57.965 --> 20:59.007
Oh, girl.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.177
Oh, girl.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.096
So many texts in a row.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.722
You like him, huh?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.558
Well, I thought I did.
But now I definitely do not.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.145
Ugh, I can't believe
I have to see him again in French class.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.730
Unless he ghosts you there too.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.401
I mean, that's what ghosts do.
They totally disappear on you.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.611
-I feel so much better now.
-Mmm.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.197
You know, your pep talks
could do with a little more pep.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.115
Mmm.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.369
<i>Isn't Pete great?</i>

21:27.452 --> 21:29.121
<i>He's so taut. Like a whippet.</i>

21:29.204 --> 21:33.125
<i>Okay, so if you have a look at the budget</i>
<i>and calendar I sent over,</i>

21:33.208 --> 21:35.711
I think you'll see
that we can launch in the fall.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.964
Pardon. <i>Automne.</i>

21:39.047 --> 21:41.341
<i>I hope you don't mind me</i>
<i>starting on these documents,</i>

21:41.425 --> 21:43.176
<i>I wanted you to hit the ground running.</i>

21:43.260 --> 21:45.053
Or should I say, "riding"?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.475
So what do you think of this idea:

21:50.559 --> 21:52.644
Participate
in the Tour de France,

21:52.728 --> 21:56.148
from the comfort of your home.

21:56.231 --> 22:00.819
I think that we should leave the creative
to the people actually in Paris.

22:00.902 --> 22:04.489
The French are susceptible to having
their culture interpreted by foreigners

22:04.573 --> 22:05.949
and shoved down their throats.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.534
I totally agree.

22:07.617 --> 22:12.331
Sylvie, this is why we're going to work
so well together. We get each other.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.125
Okay, let's schedule
a weekly progress call.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.793
<i>I'm looking at this calendar,</i>

22:16.877 --> 22:19.546
and I don't see
how we can make Pelotech work.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.883
If it's an issue of scheduling
and resources, we can fix that.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.926
This is an important luxury brand for us.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.138
Just because it's expensive,
it doesn't mean it's luxury.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.306
You know?

22:29.389 --> 22:32.434
I'm sorry, but it's
just not a fit for my office.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.102
<i>Your</i> office?

22:37.147 --> 22:39.566
Let's table this for now.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.526
And in the meantime,

22:41.610 --> 22:45.113
I will send you the Gilbert Group's
hierarchy of objectives.

22:47.866 --> 22:48.867
Please don't.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.340
Uh, where's the bike gone?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.718
Did it just wheel itself out of here?

23:07.886 --> 23:10.180
-Sylvie told us to get rid of it.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.682
-Luc!
-What's going on?

23:19.439 --> 23:20.482
Oh.

23:24.861 --> 23:25.987
Come on.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.365
Okay. Okay!

23:28.949 --> 23:31.910
That's rubbish, mate!
It's offside.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.037
You Brits always call offside.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.331
-Cooper.
-Em.

23:37.332 --> 23:38.166
<i>Bonjour.</i>

23:39.084 --> 23:39.918
Hi.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.003
Thanks for texting me.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.088
Of course.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.006
Chef. Can I talk to you?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.383
Excuse me.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.300
Hi.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.762
You don't text me back, answer my calls,
and then you just show up here!

23:50.846 --> 23:52.514
What?

23:53.181 --> 23:55.976
I lost my phone.
I had no way of contacting you.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.561
I couldn't remember where you worked,

23:57.644 --> 23:59.771
but I remembered
you did an event at this place.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.774
Get in there!

24:02.858 --> 24:04.526
-That's one apiece, guv.
-No.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.652
Woo-hoo!

24:05.735 --> 24:08.196
-There's plenty of time to go.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.157
So can I have it back?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.118
-Have what back?
-My phone.

24:14.453 --> 24:18.039
I'm pretty sure it's in
that suit jacket of mine you stole.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.126
Oh.

24:23.003 --> 24:23.920
That jacket.

24:24.504 --> 24:28.550
Right. Uh, you just stay here
and watch the game, and I'll go get it.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.968
Cheers.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.221
Come on, boys. Come on.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.562
Oh, you got a fan.

24:40.645 --> 24:44.399
I have many fans. This one was a gift.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.152
Hmm. He is so into you.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.862
And he's kind of broke,

24:48.945 --> 24:52.824
so he probably dumpster-dived for it,
which makes me like him even more.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.076
It turns out
Alfie is not a ghost after all.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.079
He didn't answer his phone
because I had it.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.873
It was in his jacket that I borrowed.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.750
So really, <i>you're</i> the ghost.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.918
Yeah.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.337
I've got to run
because he's at Gabriel's restaurant.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.381
-Where they are watching soccer, together.
-Oh, crap!

25:08.465 --> 25:10.425
-How did that happen?
-I'll explain later.

25:15.805 --> 25:16.640
Hey!

25:17.349 --> 25:18.808
I'm sorry about all this.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.019
So when you said we couldn't be together,

25:21.102 --> 25:23.146
it wasn't because
you had an expiration date.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.524
You were seeing someone.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.566
He is the reason.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.072
Yeah, I guess. He's the reason.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.573
Well, it's good to know the truth.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.742
Even if it's hard to watch.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.244
What does that mean?

25:38.453 --> 25:41.790
I want you to be happy, Emily.
I just don't want to have to see it.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.418
Sitting on the sidelines,
watching you fall for someone.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.129
I didn't intend for you to see anything.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.548
This was an accident.

25:49.631 --> 25:50.882
Yeah, but you like him.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.593
I can tell.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.303
Whoa, hey!

25:56.179 --> 25:57.430
Hey, France lost!

25:57.973 --> 25:59.432
-Huh?

25:59.516 --> 26:01.017
-Oh!
-Oh, um…

26:01.101 --> 26:02.602
-The game.
-Yeah.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.729
-Here.
-Oh. Cheers, love.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.191
So, uh, you fancy grabbing a bevvy?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.944
If that's a drink, then, please.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.320
Thanks for tracking her down.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.447
No problem. She's all yours, mate.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.241
Catch you later, yeah?

26:19.953 --> 26:22.330
He's all right. I mean, for a frog.

26:23.790 --> 26:24.624
Oh, my God.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.668
Oh, shit.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.712
My phone's not here.

26:28.795 --> 26:29.754
Okay, so,

26:30.380 --> 26:33.383
before I give this back to you,
I have to delete some messages I sent you.

26:33.466 --> 26:35.802
-All right, how many?
-Too many.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.015
Oh, Cooper. Do you like me?

26:58.742 --> 27:01.369
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Ready to ride with Pelotech?</i>
