00:30.280 --> 00:33.158
What were the band Blur previously called?

00:33.240 --> 00:35.959
Oh, er...was it Seymour?
- Very good.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.917
Blimey.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.754
Right.
How many characters did Alec Guinness play

00:41.840 --> 00:43.831
in the film Kind Hearts And Coronets?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.717
Put the radio on.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.153
Seven.
- Eight.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.879
Ah, bollocks.
- I like this song.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.316
What's the most popular name for a dog
in the USA?

00:53.400 --> 00:55.197
Oh, good one.
- Shut up!

01:05.880 --> 01:09.031
I want MacDonald's Farm on.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.475
We're listening to Mummy and Daddy's music.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.790
Oh, come on, David. Be fair.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.713
He's got to learn
he can't have everything his own way.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.473
I want MacDonald's Farm on!

01:19.560 --> 01:21.551
Josh!

01:25.160 --> 01:27.549
Right.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.748
No, no, no, next.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.831
Oh, no! No, not that.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.434
No, change it.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.233
Yeah, that's all right.

01:53.320 --> 01:57.233
Right. Whose famous last words were these?

01:57.320 --> 01:59.151
''I shall hear in heaven. ''

01:59.240 --> 02:00.878
Yours, if you don't put that down!

02:00.960 --> 02:02.791
I'm trying to make things go quicker.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.233
Well, you're failing.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.469
Well, thank you.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.916
Actually, to be honest, I feel a bit sick.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.276
Well, that's cos you're reading
in the car, love.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.749
Rachel, will you put the window down?

02:18.920 --> 02:21.150
<i>What are you doing?
- Was it Mozart?</i>

02:21.240 --> 02:23.879
<i>Beethoven.
- Ah, clever!</i>

02:23.960 --> 02:25.791
<i>You're clever.</i>

02:29.080 --> 02:31.036
He did warn you he was going to be sick.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.270
I'd just had the car fully valeted.

02:33.360 --> 02:37.797
David, we've run out of tissues. Could you
give me your handkerchief or something?

02:37.880 --> 02:39.472
Tissues!

02:39.560 --> 02:40.913
OK.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.116
Oh, this is a great way to start a holiday.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.954
Oh, no!
- Oh, sweetheart!

02:48.040 --> 02:51.476
He's going to stain the leather trim.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.839
Why have we stopped? Are we lost?
- We're here.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.957
Where?
- The back of beyond, by the looks of it.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.157
Where we're staying.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.275
There?

03:40.680 --> 03:43.399
Does everyone know
what they're doing for the Millennium?

03:43.480 --> 03:47.314
Millennium? Oh, I'm trying to avoid it.
I'm sick and tired of the whole thing.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.676
Yeah, worse than Christmas.
- Still, you must have plans.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.753
Plans, my arse. No, I'm just glad
that Rachel and me are going to be together.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.274
We waited to see
what parties we were invited to.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.033
And?
- We're still waiting.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.351
You haven't been invited to any?
- Oh, yeah, course we have. Loads.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.192
Er...one.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.358
But not by people we'd
want to spend any time with.

04:07.459 --> 04:09.637
Certainly not the end of the century.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.870
Well, we thought we'd just have
a quiet night in.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.188
On New Year's Eve?

04:13.280 --> 04:17.432
Well, we weren't, you know, sure
that we'd have anything to celebrate.

04:18.154 --> 04:19.685
So, that's it, is it?

04:20.081 --> 04:22.640
I mean, this is possibly the
most historic moment of our lives,

04:22.720 --> 04:24.836
and you two are at a party
you'd rather miss,

04:24.920 --> 04:27.354
and you two are gonna be at home
watching television.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.398
What's wrong with that?
Who says you have to have a good time?

04:30.480 --> 04:33.870
New Year's always shite. The Millennium
will be a hundred times worse.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.154
Thousand.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.596
It's meaningless. It's not a moment
in history. It's a moment in time.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.240
Why do anything special? What are you doing?

04:41.320 --> 04:43.675
Oh, we're going away.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.830
We've rented this...big place,

04:45.920 --> 04:50.198
and we thought
we might invite a few friends to join us.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.874
Oh, no. You see, that...
that sounds very nice, actually.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.316
You didn't want to do anything special.
- No, no, but, you know...

04:56.400 --> 04:59.039
You should be with friends,
shouldn't you, David?

04:59.120 --> 05:01.918
Well, the question is, which friends
to invite?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.275
Oh, David, shut up!

05:04.360 --> 05:06.555
Look, we'd really like it if you all come.

05:08.480 --> 05:12.439
I would have invited you all sooner, if I'd
known we could book this particular place.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.795
Somewhere I used to go
on my family holidays,

05:15.170 --> 05:16.831
and I'd be allowed to
take a school friend.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.435
I mean, it really is fantastic.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.630
You spent your holidays here?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.756
Yeah, some of them.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.874
You'll never take my castle!

05:29.960 --> 05:31.518
I'll have your castle.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.556
En garde!

05:35.440 --> 05:37.192
Bloody hell!

05:38.040 --> 05:40.429
What were your holidays like, then, Pete?

05:52.760 --> 05:54.432
Oh, good shot, Pete!

05:54.520 --> 05:57.592
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

05:58.400 --> 06:01.198
He'll play for England one of these days,
this lad.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.875
Do you think so, Dad?
Do you really, really think so?

06:04.960 --> 06:06.916
Captain, I shouldn't wonder.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.866
When you said it's a castle, I
thought you meant in your imagination.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.316
But it really is a castle.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.277
Yeah, it was, in Tudor times.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.909
Does it have central heating?

06:21.135 --> 06:22.909
Yep. Radiators throughout.
Hot water on tap.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.513
They were clever, those Tudors.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.639
<i>This causeway floods twice a day,</i>

06:26.796 --> 06:28.991
so to leave the island,
you've got to time it right.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.116
Why would you want to leave?

06:44.160 --> 06:46.754
<i>God, it's amazing, isn't it?</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:48.751
<i>It can't come cheap, though.</i>

06:48.840 --> 06:50.796
<i>No, no, David managed to get a deal.</i>

06:50.880 --> 06:52.632
<i>For the Millennium?</i>

06:52.720 --> 06:55.439
<i>David might disappear up his own arse
sometimes,</i>

06:55.520 --> 06:57.590
<i>but he knows how to organise a holiday.</i>

07:14.760 --> 07:16.398
What are you doing?

07:16.480 --> 07:19.074
Oh, just wondering what you'd brought.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.948
You didn't happen to pack that silk thing...

07:23.040 --> 07:26.669
that I got for our first New Year together?
No? Yeah?

07:26.760 --> 07:29.479
I packed for warmth.
- Ah, well, that can't have been warm.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.278
Well, I wouldn't know.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.590
I'd hardly got it on before you took it off.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.992
Well...

07:44.000 --> 07:45.513
I think they like it.

07:45.600 --> 07:50.310
David, they absolutely love it.
You are very, very, very clever.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.758
You know, I think it's gonna be good,
this break. Don't you?

07:56.840 --> 08:00.230
Yeah, I do. I think it's gonna be
very therapeutic.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.754
Love, you don't mind us sharing a bed,
do you?

08:03.840 --> 08:06.070
Oh, shut up. Hey, come on. We're married.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.869
It's...you know. It's fine. Whatever.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.793
Hey, we had a four-poster on our honeymoon,
didn't we?

08:12.880 --> 08:16.668
One thing at a time, love.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.751
Hey, what's that noise?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.956
Do you think it's a ghost?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.560
No, I think it's an orgasm.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.437
It is.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.471
The walls here must be paper-thin.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.789
Elther that or they're bloody noisy.

08:35.880 --> 08:40.270
Come on, Pete. You can't listen.
Come on. It's private. Come here.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.437
Hey!

08:49.600 --> 08:52.194
Ah! Hi.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.316
So, you've finished, then?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.833
Unpacking, I mean.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.559
Yeah.
- David suggested we go and make a fire.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.551
Yeah...
- Yeah. A fire.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.359
Yeah. Good.
- Hot.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.755
Right. Come on. Here come the Chippendales.
Let's have a look at you.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.037
<i>Points for style!
- And physique.</i>

09:18.120 --> 09:20.634
<i>Yeah, get your kit off, lads.</i>

09:20.720 --> 09:24.872
<i>Ah, and first up,
the rugged, outdoor type, David Marsden.</i>

09:24.960 --> 09:28.475
Look at those shoulders,
honed to perfection on the golf course!

09:28.560 --> 09:30.391
<i>Come on, Daddy!</i>

09:30.480 --> 09:32.994
Yes!

09:33.080 --> 09:35.355
Devastating!

09:35.440 --> 09:38.000
<i>He sets the early pace. Well played.</i>

09:38.080 --> 09:41.197
And next up, it's Adam Williams.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.236
What's he gonna go for?

09:44.280 --> 09:46.794
Oh, he's playing safe.
He's taking on a wood chip.

09:50.360 --> 09:55.036
Thanks to the crowd, he's changed his mind.
Has he taken on more than he can chew?

09:55.120 --> 09:58.112
Go on, son. Chop to it. Come on!

10:00.920 --> 10:03.992
Oooh! Almost got your pride intact.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.911
All right. Here we go!

10:11.200 --> 10:15.079
Next, the people's favourite. La-la-la...

10:15.160 --> 10:18.038
Yes, they don't call him
The Axeman for nothing.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.999
Whole forests tremble
at the sound of his foot falling.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.278
It's a masterclass in lumberjacking.
Go for it!

10:26.360 --> 10:27.554
<i>Rubbish!</i>

10:30.240 --> 10:32.754
Ohh! Rubbish, Pete!

10:32.840 --> 10:36.071
Shut up, will you?
- I'm embarrassed.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.879
Where's your pride, Pete?

10:43.960 --> 10:46.758
Now, perhaps we should establish
a few ground rules.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.593
You're serious?

10:49.680 --> 10:52.717
Yeah. How about a swear box
for anyone mentioning the M-word?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.279
What's that?
- Motherfu...

10:54.360 --> 10:56.749
Millennium!
- Oh, no, hold on. I'm all for that.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.136
I thought you were talking
about a rota system.

10:59.673 --> 11:01.436
Cooking and cleaning
and all that bollocks.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.158
Well, we have to do that as well.

11:03.240 --> 11:08.075
Now, do we each want to do our own chores,
or take things in turn?

11:09.200 --> 11:10.997
I'm not chopping wood again.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.389
And we need to sort out a kitty system.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.314
But all this can wait, can't it, David?
- Yeah, we're on holiday.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.630
Come on. Let's have a laugh.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.435
Daddy!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.309
Oh, I don't like it!

13:10.240 --> 13:12.151
Hugh?

13:12.240 --> 13:14.515
Are you down here?

13:14.600 --> 13:16.989
I'm not playing any more.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.274
Hugh?

13:21.120 --> 13:23.270
Scared you.
- No, you didn't.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.718
Mrs Marsden, David's wet himself!

13:33.440 --> 13:36.000
''Cannon to the right of them,
Cannon to the left of them,

13:36.080 --> 13:38.389
Cannon in front of them volleyed
and thundered.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.710
Stormed at with shot and shell,

13:40.800 --> 13:42.916
Boldly they rode and well.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.958
Into the jaws of death,
into the mouth of hell,

13:46.040 --> 13:47.792
Rode the six hundred.''

13:49.000 --> 13:50.399
Yes!

13:50.480 --> 13:52.835
Well done, David!

13:53.920 --> 13:55.399
No, there's more.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.277
Hey, that was good craic tonight,
wasn't it, love?

14:00.360 --> 14:03.989
Yeah, it were a laugh. - I just hope
the nipper sleeps through tonight.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.756
Oh, now David and Karen are at it.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.520
Mercifully short, mind.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.194
Doesn't surprise me.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.233
Bloody hell.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.280
<i>Night, Adam. Night, Rachel.</i>

14:33.360 --> 14:36.238
<i>Night, Peter.
- Night, David. Night, Karen.</i>

14:36.320 --> 14:38.390
<i>Night, Peter.</i>

14:38.480 --> 14:39.833
Go on.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.751
<i>Good night, Pete.</i>

14:41.840 --> 14:44.752
<i>Night, Jenny.
- Night, Peter.</i>

14:44.840 --> 14:48.594
<i>Actually, I think I'm gonna need
another piss.</i>

14:58.280 --> 15:01.078
Er...what's that?

15:01.160 --> 15:02.388
Millennium clock.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.153
Oh, that's a quid!
- Oh, piss.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.832
How does it work?
- Batteries.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.833
Oh, I see. It's a normal clock, with a
read-out that counts down to the Millennium.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.309
Two quid!
- Oh, bugger!

15:13.400 --> 15:14.674
Is it accurate?

15:14.760 --> 15:17.035
Quartz precision.
- And it runs on batteries?

15:18.680 --> 15:21.911
Er...yeah,
we set it by the speaking clock at home.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.278
But there's no TV and radio here, so how
are we gonna know when it's the big moment?

15:26.360 --> 15:29.238
Nearly said Millennium.
- Now, that is a quid!

15:29.320 --> 15:31.595
Shite.
- Hey, have you seen this?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.752
What?
- David's written us out a rota.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.876
What?
- You and Pete are cooking tonight.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.076
Oh, no, I'm on holiday.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.310
Well, you've still got to eat.
- So have we.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.312
But me and Adam can't cook.
- Why can't we do the washing-up?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.789
You're down to do that, as well.
- Huh?

15:48.800 --> 15:51.758
She's right. We're down to do the lot!
That's not fair.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.432
Come on. What does he take us for?

15:53.520 --> 15:54.669
Women?

15:54.760 --> 15:56.830
Oh, well said, Germaine.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.553
David, why don't you just take the car?

16:04.640 --> 16:06.631
The tide will be in shortly.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.438
Do you know what you're doing?

16:08.520 --> 16:11.114
Karen,
it's a voyage of only a few hundred metres.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.350
In fact, ''voyage'' is rather a grand
word for it.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.518
Take care.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.388
Bye, David.
- Don't forget the booze, big fella.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.755
<i>You and Adam - you seem to be doing good.</i>

16:45.840 --> 16:48.354
<i>Yeah? What makes you say that?</i>

16:48.440 --> 16:50.396
I don't know. Just seeing you together.

16:50.480 --> 16:54.189
Well...actually, just sort of hearing
you together.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.955
Yeah, I think we've finally put all that...

16:58.040 --> 17:00.235
Kris stuff behind us.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.470
Yeah? Oh, that's good, Rach.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.755
Thank you.
- That's good. I'm happy for you.

17:04.839 --> 17:08.719
Thanks.
You and Pete seem to be doing OK, too.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.314
Yeah, we do, don't we?
- Yeah.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.595
It's funny, cos, sort of...

17:13.680 --> 17:17.513
I just didn't think that you could
sort of fall in love with someone, you know,

17:17.599 --> 17:19.556
all over again, but...

17:20.720 --> 17:22.278
..maybe you can.

17:22.359 --> 17:26.194
Of course you can.
Lightning strikes in the same place twice.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.829
No, it doesn't! That's the point.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.148
Oh, God!

17:33.240 --> 17:36.073
No... No, it doesn't. Er...

17:36.160 --> 17:39.470
That was a very bad example. Sorry!

17:41.560 --> 17:43.915
<i>Anyway...</i>

17:44.000 --> 17:45.956
So far, so good.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.036
Yeah. Well see.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.196
God, I love it here.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.670
<i>It's so gorgeous.
- It's beautiful.</i>

17:56.760 --> 17:59.274
It's dead boring here.
There's nothing to do.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.555
We're playing golf.
- Shot!

18:01.640 --> 18:05.269
No, we're not.
We're chipping balls into a wooden boat...

18:05.360 --> 18:07.271
Whoa! Hang on.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.669
..because we're bored shitless.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.716
I found a shop there selling fireworks.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.268
I thought we might set off a few
to welcome the New Year.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.316
Ah, that's a quid.
- No, it isn't.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.358
Yeah, it is. You said Millennium.
- No, you did.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.116
Can you guys give me a hand with that stuff?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.111
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, in a minute.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.272
We're in the middle of a tense battle.
I'm Tiger Woods, obviously.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.316
And he's Nick Faldo.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.960
Well, at least, he's playing like
Nick Faldo.

18:33.040 --> 18:37.955
Erm...sorry, but could you mind the clubs?
Cos they're brand-new.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.792
Yeah.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.951
I reckon we should shove one up his arse.
What do you reckon? A putter?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.110
A three-wood would go further.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.470
You know, I'm never coming on holiday
with him again. It's just...

18:50.560 --> 18:54.678
One night in the pub I could stand. But
if there was a lock-in, absolutely no way.

18:54.760 --> 18:58.070
He's... He's driving me mad.
All these rules and rotas.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.310
It's like being on holiday with your mam.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.791
God Almighty! I think you got a birdie.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.519
Actually, maybe an albatross.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.549
What are we gonna do about tea tonight?

19:11.640 --> 19:14.438
Cheat. Do you fancy a pint later?

19:14.520 --> 19:16.431
Oh, do I! He's only bought wine.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.476
Well...

19:31.120 --> 19:34.430
If you show me yours, I'll show you mine.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.232
Oh, my God, I didn't see you there.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.197
Are you all right?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.232
Fine.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.151
What's wrong?

20:06.840 --> 20:08.398
Nothing.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.031
Karen...I don't think anyone likes me.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.111
What?

20:21.200 --> 20:25.113
They laugh behind my back.
They don't want me around.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.679
Who?

20:26.760 --> 20:28.876
Pete and Adam. Jenny.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.957
Ramona hates me.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.313
Rachel really likes you.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.154
So, you admit it's true?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.628
David, darling, no-one dislikes you.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.995
They just maybe find you
a little bit intense,

20:46.080 --> 20:48.275
you know, playing milk monitor
the whole time.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.317
I just want people to enjoy themselves.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.678
I know you do, darling, but you can't force
them to, and they might resent you trying.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.672
You think I should tone it down a bit?

21:01.880 --> 21:04.314
Maybe you should scrap
the Cluedo tournament.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.954
OK.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.471
<i>Woo-hoo! This is great.</i>

21:20.560 --> 21:22.516
<i>Yeah. I love it.</i>

21:24.080 --> 21:28.039
Don't you think they'll miss us? - I told
them we were going on a nature ramble.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.714
What, and they believed you?
- David even wanted to come.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.756
I had to creep out behind his back.

21:34.080 --> 21:38.198
What's in this box here? Blimey, it's
the fireworks. We forgot to take them in.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.396
Oh, just put that rag on them and
keep them dry.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.718
Yes, one wouldn't want to ruin his display.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.429
No, we might piss him off slightly more!
- Yes.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.318
Oh, the life on the ocean waves!

21:54.080 --> 21:58.039
<i>Under that rock there. There's
one under the rock. Quick, quick, quick!</i>

21:58.120 --> 22:00.714
<i>Where?
- He's gone under there.</i>

22:00.800 --> 22:04.349
Come on. - It's very good of you
to come on this trip.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.079
I thought you'd spend the Millennium
with your boyfriend.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.991
Yeah, well, we had talk about it.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.832
God, that's awful.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.354
No, he'll be back next week.
I'll see him then.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.197
Got one!

22:50.280 --> 22:54.637
Another one?
You are such a good little crab-catcher!

22:57.920 --> 22:59.638
Cheers.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.554
Adam, I really think we should phone David
and let him know where we are.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.949
Pete, will you relax? We're on our holidays.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.191
Come on. We'll have these,
pick up the pizzas and be back before dark.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.658
Yeah, but it's my turn
to give the nipper a bath.

23:12.036 --> 23:13.637
I don't want to be in Jenny's bad books.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.822
Oh, right. And you think, by
telling her we're down the pub,

23:16.092 --> 23:18.748
you'll get some Brownie points?

23:19.720 --> 23:21.392
Point taken.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.678
You know something?
Since having cancer, beer's tasted better.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.997
You mean having a gonad chopped off
improves your taste buds?

23:30.080 --> 23:32.435
No, you bollocks! I mean you
appreciate it more.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.080
Yeah, obviously. It makes you
less irritable.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.752
You were so lucky having cancer.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.512
Really?

23:40.600 --> 23:42.238
Oh, you're all right now.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.788
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I'm a bollock short, but...

23:44.880 --> 23:47.872
But you got Rachel back.
You know. I wish it had happened to me.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.439
You and Jen are together.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.671
Yeah, we're under the same roof,
but we're not back together.

23:52.760 --> 23:56.070
I mean, she's making the effort,
but it doesn't come naturally.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.869
I mean, if I'd had cancer
or a near-death experience...

23:59.960 --> 24:02.349
or even been in a coma,

24:02.440 --> 24:04.954
she might learn to love me again.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.554
Well, you be careful what you wish for.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.870
Come on, let's bed these.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.358
Hey, are you sure
you're in a fit state to drive this thing?

24:15.440 --> 24:17.590
Huh? Four pints? Piece of piss!

24:17.680 --> 24:19.079
Watch this!

24:19.160 --> 24:22.118
Oi! Pack it in, will you?
- Round we go!

24:22.200 --> 24:25.033
<i>Come on! What are you doing?</i>

24:25.120 --> 24:28.192
Oi! Oi! Mind the pizzas, will you?

24:28.280 --> 24:30.589
Oi, stop mucking about.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.194
This is dangerous.
- All right, all right.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.714
See? Now look what you've done.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.633
Oh, it's all right. Just calm down,
tensionhead.

24:39.920 --> 24:44.550
Stop buggering about. These pizzas
are going cold. Just get it restarted.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.596
I'm trying!

24:48.280 --> 24:50.236
Watch it!

24:51.440 --> 24:54.989
Snap!
- Yeah!

24:55.080 --> 24:57.640
There's no sign of Adam or Pete.
Have you seen them?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.836
No.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.912
Oh, great. The baby's woken up.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.350
It's his turn to give him his bath. Oh, God.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.159
I'm coming, love! All right.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.479
Snap!

25:13.560 --> 25:15.471
Yay!

25:15.560 --> 25:17.835
Well done, Josh. Well done.

25:19.320 --> 25:22.357
<i>You don't know what you're doing.
You'll flood the engine.</i>

25:22.440 --> 25:25.113
<i>Since when did you become a marine engineer?</i>

25:25.200 --> 25:29.318
Just give it a couple of minutes,
and everything will be all right. Trust me.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.994
Yeah, you're probably right.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.036
<i>I could murder some pizza.</i>

25:41.320 --> 25:43.595
Do you think we should maybe look for them?

25:43.680 --> 25:46.478
They'll turn up. They always do.

25:46.560 --> 25:50.678
Yeah, but what if they've...
slipped on a rock or something?

25:50.760 --> 25:53.558
Well, if one of them had,
the other would have come for help.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.200
Oh, they're playing silly buggers somewhere.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.590
Either that or they're trying
to duck out of cooking the evening meal.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.468
Might be a blessing.
- I can't help worrying.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.478
Please, face it. It's not gonna work.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.152
Oh, God.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.959
Christ, it's getting dark.
What are we gonna do?

26:16.440 --> 26:19.352
I suggest we paddle.
- What with?

26:22.680 --> 26:24.079
Here - this.

26:24.160 --> 26:28.551
No, I think we should be getting back.
- No, no, to paddle with.

26:28.640 --> 26:32.428
Oh, right. OK.
You go over there and start that side, yeah?

26:32.520 --> 26:33.748
Yeah.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.831
OK, are you ready?
- Go.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.150
Oh! Hey, steady.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.355
Sorry.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.715
How are you getting on?
- Not good.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.518
No, me neither.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.556
Adam!

26:51.480 --> 26:53.436
Hey, I've found more torches.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.434
Right. Give them here. Jenny,
you've got one. Rachel, here.

26:56.618 --> 26:58.150
We each take a different direction.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.437
David, will you stop bossing us about?
- Rachel, it makes sense.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.236
Sorry. You're right.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.799
I'm going this way.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.030
Adam!

27:09.120 --> 27:11.953
Pete!
- Adam!

27:12.040 --> 27:13.314
Adam!

27:14.400 --> 27:15.628
Pete!

27:15.720 --> 27:17.676
Adam!

27:20.120 --> 27:22.156
Adam!

27:26.600 --> 27:29.990
Ah, this is no good. Forget it.
My paddle's gone soggy.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.513
Mine too.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.715
Maybe we should have another slice of pizza.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.360
I don't even know which direction
we're heading.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.635
Shh. Listen. Listen.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.234
Can you hear that?

27:43.200 --> 27:44.918
That's probably just the wind.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.670
Adam, I'm scared.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.638
We'll be all right.
The wind'll blow us back to shore.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.233
Or out to sea.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.076
Forget it. It's not working.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.155
Nothing.
- Right, let's ring the coastguards.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.789
Do you really think that's necessary?
- Karen, they could be in the water.

28:13.880 --> 28:17.839
Or they could be winding us up.
Why don't we check the house once more?

28:17.920 --> 28:22.277
David, we have checked the house. There is
no-one here. Please phone the coastguard!

28:23.360 --> 28:25.316
Right.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.111
Oh, shit.
- What?

28:30.080 --> 28:31.308
No signal.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.271
This is all your fault.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.794
<i>Oh, yeah?
You were the one that was buggering about.</i>

28:38.880 --> 28:41.792
Who wanted a near-death experience?
You had to take me!

28:41.880 --> 28:44.314
Oh, I only wanted the one pint,
and then go back.

28:44.400 --> 28:48.234
<i>Ah, away and boil your head!
- Oh, kiss my arse!</i>

28:53.440 --> 28:56.637
OK, that's the lights on outside.
- Right, I've done the tower.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.917
I need to turn his headlights on.
- Good idea. I'll get my keys.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.956
God, I need a pee.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.270
Oh, my God, Pete, look. Look!

29:12.040 --> 29:13.996
Oi! Oi! Oi!

29:14.080 --> 29:16.230
Oi, over here!

29:16.320 --> 29:18.276
Hey!

29:18.360 --> 29:19.918
Adam!

29:21.000 --> 29:24.436
They can't hear. Have you got a lighter?
- What? They'll never see that.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.193
No, you bollocks.
I'm gonna light the rag and wave it.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.236
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.350
Brilliant!
- Oi!

29:35.440 --> 29:37.829
Oi! Help! Hello!

29:40.400 --> 29:42.595
Over here!

29:42.680 --> 29:45.592
Adam!
- Adam!

29:47.400 --> 29:50.233
Karen! Karen, look. What's that?

29:53.680 --> 29:56.194
Over here! Over here!

29:56.280 --> 29:58.191
Oi! Oi!

29:58.280 --> 30:00.555
Oh, my hands are on fire!

30:00.640 --> 30:04.155
Throw it away! Throw it overboard.
- Where? Aaaarghh!

30:05.360 --> 30:09.353
Aaaarghh! We're on fire!
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

30:09.440 --> 30:14.673
Ohhhhh...shit!

30:18.440 --> 30:21.193
Eh?
- The tide's gone out!

30:21.280 --> 30:24.113
We're saved!
- Woooh!

30:28.200 --> 30:29.713
The fireworks!

30:58.040 --> 31:00.395
Were you scared?

31:00.480 --> 31:02.948
I would have made it through.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.237
The sea wasn't rough. We had pizza.

31:06.320 --> 31:09.357
Worst-case scenario:
we could have huddled up for warmth.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.396
I was.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.356
Yeah, so was I.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.864
I mean, you know, I've
just beaten cancer.

31:18.139 --> 31:20.476
I didn't think it was
fair to be lost at sea.

31:21.520 --> 31:24.193
Promise you won't ever
do anything like that again.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.992
Ever's a long time, Bradley.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.479
I'm not going anywhere.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.058
How could you be so stupid?

31:33.294 --> 31:36.395
You put your life on the line
for a pint and a takeaway pizza?

31:36.480 --> 31:38.218
Don't be daft! We weren't in any danger.

31:38.632 --> 31:40.996
Listen to me, right?
Rachel were worried sick.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.672
I didn't know what to think.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.911
Well, do you know what? A little
bit of concern would have been nice!

31:46.000 --> 31:48.070
Listen to me. I wanted you
back safely, right,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.833
so that I could throttle you!
A little light maiming.

31:50.920 --> 31:54.310
I mean, God, Pete, you could have drowned!
You could have drowned.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.868
The tide was out. It's easier
to drown in a bath.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.191
You weren't to know that.
It were pitch-black!

32:00.280 --> 32:02.874
You ought to be thankful
me and Adam are still alive!

32:02.960 --> 32:05.633
Oh, my God... I am thankful, right?

32:05.720 --> 32:09.030
I'm thankful
that our son won't grow up without his dad.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.268
Hi-di-ho.
- Hi.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.828
God, did you hear them last night?
- Who couldn't?

32:36.920 --> 32:40.390
They heard them on the mainland.
- Do you think we should say something?

32:40.480 --> 32:42.630
Yeah, like, ''Can you keep it
down in future?''

32:42.720 --> 32:45.029
What can you say? Best just to
leave them to it.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.759
They're probably not even aware
that we heard them.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.195
Pretend everything's normal.
- Morning.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.554
Morning!

32:54.040 --> 32:57.350
Sleep well?
- Yeah. You heard us rowing, then?

32:57.440 --> 32:59.158
Rowing? No.
- No.

32:59.240 --> 33:02.869
No? Oh, that's funny. It's just
that we heard you having sex all night.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.951
No, you didn't.
- Not last night.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.598
Night before.
- And last night.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.670
And this morning.
- That was me being sick.

33:09.760 --> 33:12.433
It was Ramona's paella.
- She said it was fresh.

33:12.520 --> 33:15.398
Yeah, she did.
- Josh told us where they found the crabs.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.358
Found them dead in a rock pool.
- Oh, you're joking?

33:30.400 --> 33:31.992
Are you all right, Pete?

33:33.360 --> 33:35.237
Yeah.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.756
No, actually. No. I'm annoyed with somebody.

33:38.840 --> 33:42.992
Who?
- David. He put me down to make the fire.

33:50.960 --> 33:54.032
Pete, we've never discussed
me telling Jenny about you and Amy.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.350
Are you going to apologise?
- No.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.118
I'm just very sorry it led to
so much trouble.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.053
Look, it's not your fault.

34:08.376 --> 34:11.040
It's mine. I should never have
got involved to start with.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.271
I just hope that you work things out.
I'd really hate it if you split up.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.190
What?
Me and Jenny, we're never gonna break up.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.838
At least, I hope not.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.509
I mean,
Jenny was bound to find out in the long run.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.751
You telling her...
just saved me the grief from later on.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.159
Do you think so?

34:33.800 --> 34:36.678
No. I'm just telling you that
to make you feel better.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.109
By the way, we used up all the wood
for the fire last night.

34:52.840 --> 34:56.514
<i>Hey! Go on, girls! Lovely.</i>

34:56.600 --> 34:59.398
<i>Very good. Very good.
- Go on, Jen.</i>

35:03.880 --> 35:06.474
<i>Oh, you're gorgeous.</i>

35:06.560 --> 35:09.154
Brilliant.

35:10.560 --> 35:13.358
Good arse, Karen.
- That's the stuff. Go on!

35:13.440 --> 35:16.398
Shake it, girls. Lovely.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.671
Go on, Jen. Nice.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.716
I want to get out.

35:24.800 --> 35:28.349
Come on, then. Only for a short time.
Come on. Up, up. Hello there.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.112
Hello.
- What's your name?

35:30.200 --> 35:32.873
Gilly Gall.
- Billy Ball?

35:34.560 --> 35:36.551
How are you?
- I'm thirsty.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.995
What do you want to drink?
- A gottle of geer.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.433
Gottle of geer.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.592
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.150
What? Are you looking up Karen's skirt?
- Yeah, I can see her geaver.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.319
You can see her what?
- Geaver.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.868
Now, back in the box.
- I'm not going in the gox.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.157
Go on, you dirty animal! Beast, get down.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.349
Do you remember I asked you a question once,
and you said no?

36:07.440 --> 36:09.556
Was this about three in a bed?

36:11.480 --> 36:14.950
About two in a church. Or a registry office.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.673
Yes.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.992
You mean you want to?

36:23.080 --> 36:25.150
No, I remember the question.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.276
Ah. Er...

36:27.360 --> 36:29.316
So, what do you think?

36:30.520 --> 36:32.715
I think...I love you.

36:33.680 --> 36:37.195
I think I want to spend the rest of my life
with you, have your child...

36:37.280 --> 36:39.555
Or children.
- Whatever.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.676
But...

36:43.760 --> 36:45.716
Marriage?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.155
Why? What's the point?

36:48.240 --> 36:51.198
Oh, I don't know. Tax. Presents.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.352
To make a grand statement to the world.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.396
Do you think the world's interested?

37:00.560 --> 37:02.994
How much do you think a wedding would cost?

37:03.080 --> 37:04.877
Oh, I don't know. Five grand.

37:04.960 --> 37:08.714
Then, of course, there's the honeymoon.
Not that we could afford one.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.677
Except a couple of days in Grimsby.

37:14.200 --> 37:18.432
Why don't we just blow the whole thing
on a couple of weeks in Bali...

37:18.520 --> 37:20.636
and see if the mood takes us
while we're there?

37:20.720 --> 37:22.392
Marry on a beach?

37:22.480 --> 37:25.517
Or just have great sex.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.556
Or both.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.992
I've never done it on a beach.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.838
Well, not with you, anyhow!

37:42.480 --> 37:45.552
Hey, Rach, are you going into the village?

37:45.640 --> 37:49.189
Yeah, I'm shopping for tonight. - Can I
come, please? I want to go to a chemist.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.033
Oh, I'II go for you, if you want.
- No, I fancy a break.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.872
OK.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.711
Mierda. La bateria!

38:18.800 --> 38:20.756
Joder!

38:20.840 --> 38:22.751
Ay!

38:25.560 --> 38:27.516
Baterias...

38:37.400 --> 38:40.756
It's funny, Jen,
coming back here after all these years.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.638
Yeah, this sort of place doesn't
change much, I imagine.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.472
But my memory does. You know.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.438
Rooms aren't where I thought they were.
That sort of thing.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.750
Everything looks different when
you're a kid.

38:50.840 --> 38:55.356
Yeah. Do you know, I remember once
my parents here having a blazing row.

38:55.440 --> 38:59.194
It was probably about nothing, but to my
brother and I it was the end of the world.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.555
We had visions of our parents splitting up,

39:01.640 --> 39:04.279
and each taking one of us
at the end of the summer.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.240
Of course, by suppertime it was
all forgotten.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.635
Well, David, you tell me, mate.

39:13.720 --> 39:17.838
Should parents stay together
for the sake of their kids?

39:18.920 --> 39:20.592
I don't know.

39:20.680 --> 39:24.639
I think they should stay together
for the sake of each other, frankly.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.240
Every marriage goes through its bad patches.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.551
But that's just what they are,
by and large - just patches.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.798
Maybe.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.031
You've got to give a marriage time,
to find out.

39:41.960 --> 39:45.157
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interfere. Here.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.800
You should be able to see some seals
from here.

39:49.640 --> 39:52.712
Hey! That one looks like Pete's mum.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.638
Oh, yeah! 40-30.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.711
That was uncatchable.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.268
Match point.
- Anyway, it was out.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.828
Match punto.
- It was out.

40:09.920 --> 40:10.875
No.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.758
Anyway, the girls are here.
I'd better give them a hand.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.914
Hey, no peanuts?
Now, did you get my desserts?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.753
Yeah.
We've got vanilla, chocolate and pistachio.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.718
Pistachio? I'm not supposed to be
that adventurous a cook.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.872
There you go, mate.
- Oh, cheers. Thanks a lot.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.110
What time do we want to eat?

40:45.200 --> 40:48.272
I'll tell you... Hey, what's happened
to that?

40:48.360 --> 40:50.794
What?
- My Millennium clock.

40:50.880 --> 40:53.030
That's a quid.
- It's not working.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.348
Time stands still.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.795
Someone took the batteries.
Was this you, David?

40:56.880 --> 40:59.030
Hmm? No, of course not.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.918
You hated this clock,
so who else would take the batteries?

41:02.000 --> 41:04.116
Calm down, Pete. It's just a clock.

41:04.200 --> 41:08.113
Yeah, a clock that was supposed to tell us
when the Millennium was.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.475
Er...I almost hate to say this, but...

41:10.560 --> 41:15.270
Just shut it. Just because it wasn't your
idea, you had to go and ruin it, didn't you?

41:15.360 --> 41:18.830
Grow up! I didn't touch your precious
Millennium clock.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.353
Maybe I should keep score.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.352
You know what you are?
A control freak. That's what you are.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.159
Well, you're an ungratefull little shit!
You know that?

41:26.240 --> 41:27.389
Charming.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.677
Have you thanked me once
for organising this holiday? Huh?

41:32.080 --> 41:35.516
You obviously have no idea what it involved.

41:35.600 --> 41:39.388
You don't just conjure castles
out of the air, you know.

41:39.480 --> 41:43.598
No, I used contacts, called in favours,
moved heaven and earth,

41:43.680 --> 41:46.831
to spend the Millennium here
with people I consider friends.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.420
I wanted it to be special.

41:53.121 --> 41:55.680
Something we could remember and
cherish for the rest of our lives.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.193
David, it is special.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.431
Yeah, and we will cherish it.
Or at least remember it.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.273
I even lied about the cost,
so it wouldn't be a burden.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.033
What, it was more than 500 quid?
- Of course it was.

42:06.120 --> 42:10.671
But it doesn't matter. It's my Mllennium
present, not that I was going to tell you.

42:10.760 --> 42:13.274
David, we'll pay our share.
- What?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.390
It's not the money, Rachel. It's the spirit.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.238
And no, Pete, I did not take your batteries.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.514
David, can I have a word?

42:25.600 --> 42:27.033
Is everything all right?

42:31.720 --> 42:33.676
Somebody did.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.432
The wind's getting up.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.871
David, I'm really sorry about what I said.
It wasn't fair.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.793
What? That I'm a control freak?

43:04.360 --> 43:06.316
Yeah, I'd say that was fair.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.152
I can be a pain at times.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.515
Huh! You can?

43:13.600 --> 43:15.830
You're a beginner, mate. I give lessons.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.837
I'm sorry I called you ungrateful.

43:22.920 --> 43:25.673
Hey, you want to talk about fair comment?

43:27.080 --> 43:31.949
Look, David, I really appreciate
everything you've done here. I really do.

43:32.040 --> 43:35.749
It's just that I'm not ungrateful -
I'm ungracious, which is worse.

43:36.840 --> 43:39.070
I really hope we don't fall out over this.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.392
You know, Pete,

43:42.480 --> 43:45.711
if we were to meet now,
you know, for the first time,

43:45.800 --> 43:48.473
we wouldn't be friends, would we?

43:48.560 --> 43:50.198
You'd think I was a prat.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.510
No. You'd think I was.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.114
Whereas he... is.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.591
No, well...

44:01.680 --> 44:05.798
I mean, we wouldn't be friends,
just because of the way our lives are now.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.519
We wouldn't be having a conversation
like this.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.716
We're all right, though, aren't we?

44:15.880 --> 44:17.108
Well, I am.

44:18.920 --> 44:21.036
I'm going to be a father again.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.994
Crikey! Congratulations.

44:33.800 --> 44:36.951
Not a bad way to see in the New Year.
- How are we gonna see it in?

44:37.040 --> 44:40.396
Oh, we've plenty more champagne.
- But how will we know it's midnight?

44:40.480 --> 44:44.553
We could celebrate each time someone's watch
says it's midnight. One might be accurate.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.868
Or not.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.474
No, no, it doesn't matter. OK?

44:48.560 --> 44:53.031
Like we've always said,
it's just a meaningless moment in time.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.951
What, the dawn of the new Millennium?

44:55.040 --> 44:57.952
Well...
- Mmm...

44:59.000 --> 45:01.514
That's it. That's what we should do.
- What?

45:01.600 --> 45:05.149
I'm clever. We sit outside under the stars.
- Yes!

45:05.240 --> 45:08.755
Then we'll know it's midnight,
because the Millennium bug'll kick in,

45:08.840 --> 45:11.354
and we'll watch all the planes crashing!

45:11.440 --> 45:13.158
<i>No.</i>

45:13.240 --> 45:18.234
We sit there and wait for the new dawn.
You know - the dawn of the year 2000.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.591
What? All night?

45:28.680 --> 45:30.318
What time is it?

45:31.400 --> 45:33.118
Quarter to eight.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.111
Not long now, then.

45:35.200 --> 45:39.432
Thank God for that. It's enough
to freeze your bollocks off here.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.397
Or in my case, bollock.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.436
True.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.675
Shall we do this again next year?
- Yeah.

45:46.760 --> 45:51.709
No, we can't. We're going to Bali.
- Ooh! That's a little bit special.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.756
Well, it might be special.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.235
Welcome to the year 2000, folks.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.636
Happy New Year, Rachel Bradley.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.190
Happy New Year, Karen.
- Happy New Year.

46:11.280 --> 46:14.352
Happy New Year, darling.
- Happy New Year.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.790
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.

46:17.880 --> 46:20.872
Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.520
Happy New Year, Karen.
- Happy New Year, Jen.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.596
Happy New Year, Pete.
- Happy New Year, Jen.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.511
Happy New Year.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.477
Happy New Year, Rachel.

46:32.560 --> 46:35.233
Happy New Year, Jenny.
- You too, mate.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.836
Happy New Year, Jen.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.196
I hope so.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.716
<i>Can we go to bed now?</i>

47:04.305 --> 47:10.739
