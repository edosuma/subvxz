01:00.225 --> 01:02.660
<i>My mother died
six months ago today.</i>

01:05.896 --> 01:09.333
<i>At the hospital, they told
us she'd had an aneurysm.</i>

01:13.303 --> 01:15.606
<i>There was nothing
I could do for her.</i>

01:19.277 --> 01:22.481
<i>I guess I've gotten pretty
good at pretending to be okay.</i>

01:38.229 --> 01:40.328
<i>I don't think this
stupid thing is even working.</i>

01:40.330 --> 01:41.664
<i>You turn it on?</i>

01:41.666 --> 01:43.766
<i>Of course I turned it on.</i>

01:43.768 --> 01:46.602
<i>Did you take
the lens cap off?</i>

01:46.604 --> 01:48.438
<i>Yeah, that
probably would help.</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:49.838
<i>Okay, Phoebe,
can you just...</i>

01:49.840 --> 01:50.976
<i>Okay.</i>

01:51.208 --> 01:52.241
<i>Ready?</i>

01:52.243 --> 01:54.944
<i>Rolling, and action.</i>

01:54.946 --> 01:57.445
<i>Video Diary, day 18.</i>

01:57.447 --> 02:00.750
<i>Now, today is an
extremely important day.</i>

02:00.752 --> 02:02.551
<i>Why?</i>

02:02.553 --> 02:04.686
<i>Because here is my application
to the University of Chicago,</i>

02:04.688 --> 02:06.388
<i>where I'm hoping to study
Classics in the fall.</i>

02:06.390 --> 02:07.989
<i>Have you ever heard of the Internet?</i>

02:07.991 --> 02:09.826
<i>I know nowadays you can
submit this stuff online,</i>

02:09.828 --> 02:12.595
<i>but personally, I prefer
the more traditional route.</i>

02:12.597 --> 02:15.498
<i>As you can see, this
envelope is seriously thick.</i>

02:15.500 --> 02:17.001
<i>Why is that?</i>

02:17.234 --> 02:18.868
<i>Well, question seven on
the application asks you</i>

02:18.870 --> 02:20.604
<i>to tell them what your best
and worst qualities are,</i>

02:20.606 --> 02:22.571
<i>but they only give you
three-and-a-half inches.</i>

02:22.573 --> 02:23.873
<i>Addy, watch the road.</i>

02:23.875 --> 02:25.541
<i>Three-and-a-half
inches on a page.</i>

02:25.543 --> 02:27.343
<i>I'm sorry, but my worst
qualities took up a lot more</i>

02:27.345 --> 02:28.810
<i>than three-and-a-half
inches.</i>

02:28.812 --> 02:30.647
<i>So I decided to throw
in a few extra pages.</i>

02:30.649 --> 02:31.880
<i>How many?</i>

02:31.882 --> 02:33.682
<i>- Twenty-two to be exact.
- Wow!</i>

02:33.684 --> 02:35.317
<i>- I realize that might seem a bit excessive.
- It does.</i>

02:35.319 --> 02:37.619
<i>However, how are you expected</i>

02:37.621 --> 02:40.024
<i>to express the very
essence of your being</i>

02:40.257 --> 02:42.826
<i>and your views on how
insanely crazy this world is</i>

02:42.828 --> 02:44.726
<i>in such a tiny space on a page?</i>

02:44.728 --> 02:46.295
<i>- I mean, it's absurd.
- Okay, Addy, shut up already.</i>

02:46.297 --> 02:47.596
<i>There's a mailbox right there.</i>

02:47.598 --> 02:48.930
<i>Great.</i>

02:48.932 --> 02:51.600
<i>Phoebe? Can you please film this?</i>

02:51.602 --> 02:53.335
<i>You're on me, right?</i>

02:53.337 --> 02:55.672
<i>Right.</i>

02:55.674 --> 02:57.974
<i>And now the moment we've
all been waiting for.</i>

02:57.976 --> 02:59.841
<i>I know it's a moment you're
very excited about, Phoebe.</i>

02:59.843 --> 03:01.310
<i>You're very excited
about this, aren't you?</i>

03:01.312 --> 03:02.712
<i>I'm excited to get some coffee.</i>

03:02.714 --> 03:04.513
<i>Just put it in the box already.</i>

03:04.515 --> 03:05.915
<i>Okay, give me the camera.</i>

03:05.917 --> 03:07.586
<i>Oh, Jesus, he's still not done.</i>

03:10.354 --> 03:11.654
<i>Do it.</i>

03:11.656 --> 03:12.755
<i>Hey! Move it!</i>

03:12.757 --> 03:14.590
<i>You know what?</i>

03:14.592 --> 03:16.858
<i>No. I'm not too worried
about the extra pages</i>

03:16.860 --> 03:18.862
<i>because wasn't it Virgil who said,</i>

03:18.864 --> 03:21.730
<i>"Fortune sides with him who dares"?</i>

03:21.732 --> 03:27.469
<i>Or perhaps even more apropos are
the immortal words of David Bowie,</i>

03:27.471 --> 03:29.704
<i>"I don't know where
I'm going from here,</i>

03:29.706 --> 03:32.678
<i>"but I promise it won't be boring."</i>

03:34.745 --> 03:37.613
<i>They're never going to
read 22 extra pages, Addison.</i>

03:37.615 --> 03:39.981
<i>Well, for those of us who
didn't get into Yale early, Phoebe,</i>

03:39.983 --> 03:43.087
we have to put in a little extra effort.

03:43.321 --> 03:45.089
Two medium Americanos.

03:45.323 --> 03:46.456
What's your name?

03:46.458 --> 03:48.624
Add... Screw you, Brandon.

03:48.626 --> 03:50.527
Are you seriously with this guy?

03:50.529 --> 03:52.561
Do you seriously imagine I
give a shit what you think?

03:52.563 --> 03:54.863
Yeah, but the whole school
thinks you lost your mind, so...

03:54.865 --> 03:57.566
- Hey, Kevin, two medium Americanos.
- Got it.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.636
- Are you going to pay for that?
- Nope.

03:59.638 --> 04:02.637
Two medium Americanos for
Addison coming right up.

04:02.639 --> 04:03.973
- What's going on, brother?
- How you doing, man?

04:03.975 --> 04:05.541
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

04:05.543 --> 04:07.543
- Did you read it, yet?
- Oh!

04:07.545 --> 04:09.445
What? Dude, how are you so fast?

04:09.447 --> 04:11.380
I don't understand. What did you think?

04:11.382 --> 04:13.082
We'll talk about it after
you've read the James Baldwin.

04:13.084 --> 04:14.784
Come on, man. I'm not as fast as you.

04:14.786 --> 04:16.517
Oh... Have you guys
had your first kiss yet?

04:16.519 --> 04:18.452
No, I'm waiting.

04:18.454 --> 04:19.689
- Of course you would.
- You should've seen this guy

04:19.690 --> 04:21.589
in philosophy class the other day,

04:21.591 --> 04:23.025
he nailed Miss Keneally to
the wall. It was incredible.

04:23.027 --> 04:24.593
- Why?
- Because she was giving a stupid lecture

04:24.595 --> 04:26.494
about why students cut class.

04:26.496 --> 04:28.896
And he said, "You're the
reason why students cut class."

04:28.898 --> 04:30.833
- Kevin.
- No. I said,

04:30.835 --> 04:32.735
"People like Miss Keneally
are the reason kids cut class."

04:32.737 --> 04:34.403
I was joking obviously.

04:34.405 --> 04:35.905
He wasn't joking. It was incredible.

04:35.907 --> 04:37.807
No, she is what's wrong
with the education system.

04:37.809 --> 04:39.809
- Dude, I got to work. Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

04:39.811 --> 04:42.110
Thank you. Good to see you, Phoebs.

04:42.112 --> 04:43.879
You got it.

04:43.881 --> 04:45.948
You stand up for the people,
Kevin. You're a good man.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.549
- Here you go. Sure.
- Thanks.

04:47.551 --> 04:48.785
Phoebe?

04:48.787 --> 04:50.585
- Huh? What's up?
- How's he doing?

04:50.587 --> 04:52.554
He's okay.

04:52.556 --> 04:54.158
I'll see you later.

05:06.804 --> 05:08.072
It's chilly.

05:09.974 --> 05:11.643
- Can I ask you something?
- Mmm?

05:13.076 --> 05:17.879
I feel like you hanging
out with me has, like,

05:17.881 --> 05:20.682
a detrimental effect on your
standing with the cool kids.

05:20.684 --> 05:22.651
We've always hung out, Addison.

05:22.653 --> 05:24.364
Not really. I mean, we haven't
really since eighth grade.

05:24.388 --> 05:26.157
I sort of went invisible there for a while.

05:26.390 --> 05:28.758
Okay. Well, maybe it's because
I find every guy in high school

05:28.760 --> 05:32.898
to be completely dull and predictable.

05:33.698 --> 05:35.166
And why is that?

05:35.400 --> 05:37.869
Are they predictable
because they want to hook up?

05:39.403 --> 05:40.903
Can we just get some music or something?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.605
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

05:42.607 --> 05:46.174
I feel like you see me as
somehow sexually neutral

05:46.176 --> 05:49.612
from the Latin "neuter,"
as in, without testicles.

05:49.614 --> 05:51.814
No, I don't see you that way.

05:51.816 --> 05:53.581
I hate to break it to you, Phoebe.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.049
I don't want to disappoint you.

05:55.051 --> 05:56.785
But guess what?

05:56.787 --> 05:59.024
I want what all the other guys want, too.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.495
That's okay.

06:05.496 --> 06:06.629
Really?

06:06.631 --> 06:08.698
Actually,

06:08.700 --> 06:11.167
I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

06:11.169 --> 06:15.240
And I guess now is as good
a time as any to tell you.

06:17.775 --> 06:21.246
I don't want to go off to college as a...

06:22.046 --> 06:23.515
As a what?

06:24.915 --> 06:28.850
Without having, you know,

06:28.852 --> 06:30.087
done it.

06:31.621 --> 06:32.922
Done what?

06:32.924 --> 06:34.956
Screw you, Addison.

06:34.958 --> 06:37.025
I wanna get it over with.

06:37.027 --> 06:43.064
All right? I want to have sex
with a guy who I feel safe around.

06:43.066 --> 06:44.732
You know? Who won't judge me.

06:44.734 --> 06:48.639
And who is definitely a virgin, too.

06:52.576 --> 06:54.208
You're talking about me?

06:54.210 --> 06:56.244
Wait, what? What makes you
think that I'm a virgin?

06:56.246 --> 07:00.148
Addison, shut up.

07:00.150 --> 07:03.687
So, my mom is in a meeting with the
Secretary of Commerce until 6:00 p.m.

07:05.623 --> 07:07.790
- You want to do this right now?
- Yeah.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.958
While there's a meeting between your
mom and the Secretary of Commerce?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.693
Addison, I swear to God, if
you ask me another question,

07:11.695 --> 07:14.095
- I'm gonna change my mind.
- Okay, okay, okay.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.884
Um...

08:08.886 --> 08:11.052
Do you think we should kiss?

08:11.054 --> 08:12.222
Uh...

08:15.326 --> 08:17.158
I think we should kiss.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.362
Okay.

08:39.350 --> 08:40.684
Here.

08:58.069 --> 09:00.104
- Shit! Be careful.
- Sorry.

09:01.071 --> 09:02.206
Okay.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.245
There.

09:09.245 --> 09:11.814
Okay. So...

09:11.816 --> 09:13.348
That's what this whole
thing is about, right?

09:13.350 --> 09:16.051
There? That's all you're gonna say?

09:16.053 --> 09:18.689
There? I just gave myself to you.

09:22.659 --> 09:24.293
There.

09:24.295 --> 09:25.961
Should I keep going?

09:25.963 --> 09:27.228
Sure.

09:27.230 --> 09:29.165
- Sure?
- Yeah?

09:29.167 --> 09:30.732
Yeah?

09:30.734 --> 09:31.835
Okay.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.446
- Can I keep kissing you?
- Okay.

09:57.027 --> 09:58.861
Yeah, I wonder if you can.

09:58.863 --> 10:01.997
My son is making a film
with my old video camera

10:01.999 --> 10:04.966
and he only has one tape left.

10:04.968 --> 10:09.407
And your website says that you
sell new old ones, so to speak.

10:11.776 --> 10:15.013
Yeah, VHS-Cs. Sixty minutes.

10:17.047 --> 10:19.147
Yeah, I'll hold.

10:19.149 --> 10:22.751
<i>We're here at the Seven
Stars Bakery, and as you can tell,</i>

10:22.753 --> 10:25.020
<i>it is a very active crime scene.</i>

10:25.022 --> 10:29.024
<i>And what we've learned is that
at least one person has died.</i>

10:29.026 --> 10:31.093
<i>We'll continue to
bring you information</i>

10:31.095 --> 10:32.560
<i>and details as it becomes available.</i>

10:32.562 --> 10:35.430
<i>Now, there has been
significant discussion</i>

10:35.432 --> 10:37.501
<i>about whether or not this
could be gang related.</i>

10:43.139 --> 10:44.141
Hey.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.141
Hey.

10:46.143 --> 10:47.512
So, what do you think?

10:48.912 --> 10:51.112
That was okay, right?

10:51.114 --> 10:55.016
Yeah. I mean, that... That's gotta
be some of the best sex I've ever had.

11:00.056 --> 11:01.223
I can't believe we just did that.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.493
Yeah.

11:02.726 --> 11:04.095
Are you okay?

11:04.963 --> 11:06.228
Yeah.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.064
You know, I feel like...

11:08.066 --> 11:12.300
I feel like I just checked
a really important box.

11:12.302 --> 11:16.005
I feel like I just checkmated it.

11:31.422 --> 11:32.523
What's that noise?

11:32.757 --> 11:34.893
- I think it's my pager.
- Oh...

11:40.498 --> 11:44.132
Okay. You should probably get that.

11:44.134 --> 11:46.101
I can't believe you still
actually use that thing.

11:46.103 --> 11:47.435
My dad. Can I use your landline?

11:47.437 --> 11:48.840
Yeah, sure.

11:50.374 --> 11:52.542
My mom's calling me.

11:52.777 --> 11:54.275
Oh, God, she never calls from work.

11:54.277 --> 11:56.178
- Do you think she knows?
- That's weird. I don't know.

11:56.180 --> 11:59.184
I swear to God, she has a
sixth sense about this stuff.

12:00.149 --> 12:01.285
Hello?

12:02.385 --> 12:03.986
Yeah.

12:03.988 --> 12:05.487
Wait, wait. Mom, slow down. What?

12:05.489 --> 12:07.389
<i>There was a
shooting at Seven Stars.</i>

12:07.391 --> 12:09.123
<i>A kid named Kevin
Broadus was killed.</i>

12:09.125 --> 12:10.892
Oh, my God. When?

12:10.894 --> 12:11.959
What happened?

12:11.961 --> 12:13.962
It's Kevin.

12:13.964 --> 12:15.598
<i>Kennedy High
School student Kevin Broadus</i>

12:15.600 --> 12:18.366
<i>was gunned down today by
an unidentified assailant.</i>

12:18.368 --> 12:20.868
<i>...fled the scene of
the crime on a red Honda motorcycle.</i>

12:20.870 --> 12:23.472
<i>Only one person
was targeted. No money was stolen.</i>

12:23.474 --> 12:25.873
<i>This has all the hallmarks
of a gang killing.</i>

12:25.875 --> 12:27.275
<i>We're
gonna take you now live</i>

12:27.277 --> 12:28.776
<i>to the Metro Police
press conference,</i>

12:28.778 --> 12:30.913
<i>where Detective Thompson
is taking questions.</i>

12:30.915 --> 12:31.979
<i>Still very early at this
point. We're not ruling anything out.</i>

12:31.981 --> 12:33.683
<i>Thank you all.</i>

12:33.917 --> 12:36.237
<i>We'll be with you when we have
more information. Thank you.</i>

12:47.129 --> 12:50.165
Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you
know if Detective Thompson's here?

12:50.167 --> 12:52.034
No, I think he just left.

12:53.571 --> 12:55.904
- Do they have any idea who did it?
- I doubt it.

12:55.906 --> 12:58.040
You know, these guys
usually tend to close ranks.

12:58.042 --> 12:59.574
Who? Which guys?

12:59.576 --> 13:01.142
Whatever gang he's in.

13:01.144 --> 13:03.145
They'll just hide him
until no one cares anymore.

13:03.147 --> 13:04.867
Why is everyone saying
this is a gang thing?

13:05.449 --> 13:06.551
It's D.C.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.219
Addison!

13:45.221 --> 13:47.055
Addison, why the hell
didn't you call me back?

13:47.057 --> 13:48.592
I paged you twice.

13:51.394 --> 13:52.594
Something happened.

13:52.596 --> 13:54.529
I know what happened.

13:54.531 --> 13:56.935
It's all over the news. And
I know you go to that place.

13:59.235 --> 14:00.370
What?

14:02.473 --> 14:04.309
Was he a friend of yours?

14:06.476 --> 14:08.109
Oh, no.

14:08.111 --> 14:09.379
I'm sorry.

14:12.148 --> 14:13.549
Son. I'm sorry.

14:13.551 --> 14:16.352
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna go to bed.

14:16.354 --> 14:17.388
Okay.

14:23.695 --> 14:25.660
<i>This is a
community and neighborhood</i>

14:25.662 --> 14:29.064
<i>that is concerned about the
killing of a 17-year-old.</i>

14:29.066 --> 14:32.133
<i>Well, this community
should know they can rest assured</i>

14:32.135 --> 14:34.468
<i>that the Metro D.C.
Police Department</i>

14:34.470 --> 14:38.406
<i>is doing everything in our power
to find the people who did this.</i>

14:38.408 --> 14:40.008
- <i>And we will find them.</i>
- Phoebe?

14:40.677 --> 14:43.212
Honey? You almost ready?

14:43.214 --> 14:44.748
I thought I'd take you to school.

14:44.981 --> 14:47.149
No. I can... I can drive myself. It's fine.

14:47.151 --> 14:49.684
- Just, please.
- Mom, can you leave it on? Please?

14:49.686 --> 14:53.354
No. It's really... It's not good
for you to obsess about this.

14:53.356 --> 14:55.458
I'm not obsessing.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.493
Listen, I called Denise last
night, and we both agreed

14:58.495 --> 15:02.131
that you should see her for just a
couple of sessions, that it would be...

15:02.133 --> 15:03.564
Mom, you're overreacting. Just drop it.

15:03.566 --> 15:05.166
I'm not overreacting.

15:05.168 --> 15:07.702
I just think it's a
very traumatic experience

15:07.704 --> 15:10.271
- and I think that you need to...
- I'm not traumatized.

15:10.273 --> 15:12.309
Well, I am! I'm traumatized.

15:13.476 --> 15:16.178
Just call her! Okay?

15:16.180 --> 15:17.713
I've had experience in this, you know?

15:17.715 --> 15:20.248
I've learned the hard way

15:20.250 --> 15:23.319
that you really can't pretend
that this never happened.

15:23.321 --> 15:25.588
You need to talk to somebody.

15:25.590 --> 15:28.522
And, clearly,

15:28.524 --> 15:30.595
you don't want it to be me.

15:50.714 --> 15:51.715
Addy.

15:52.416 --> 15:53.518
Yeah.

15:54.284 --> 15:56.385
Hey. Morning.

15:56.387 --> 15:57.751
Hey, Dad.

15:57.753 --> 16:01.155
If you want to stay home today, it's okay.

16:01.157 --> 16:02.491
You know, I get it.

16:02.493 --> 16:04.425
No, it's fine. I'm going in.

16:04.427 --> 16:07.463
Well, then, why don't I drive you?

16:07.465 --> 16:08.766
No, I can drive myself.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.198
Mmm...

16:11.200 --> 16:12.836
You... You all right?

16:14.738 --> 16:17.238
Not really, but...

16:17.240 --> 16:18.575
You want to talk about it?

16:20.076 --> 16:21.776
No.

16:21.778 --> 16:23.411
Thanks for this, by the way.

16:23.413 --> 16:25.347
Oh, yeah. I'm glad you
could find a use for it.

16:25.349 --> 16:27.516
You know, when I pulled it out of the box,

16:27.518 --> 16:32.386
I found all this footage of you,
you know, when you were little.

16:32.388 --> 16:33.590
The three of us.

16:34.391 --> 16:35.656
Uh-huh...

16:35.658 --> 16:38.459
Probably take a look at it sometime.

16:38.461 --> 16:41.530
All right, well, I don't
want to be late, so...

16:41.532 --> 16:42.597
All right.

16:42.599 --> 16:43.799
All right, Dad.

16:43.801 --> 16:45.802
Take it easy.

16:48.205 --> 16:49.440
Love you.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.684

17:16.233 --> 17:18.665

shop before the shooting?</i>

17:18.667 --> 17:20.367
Um, no.

17:20.369 --> 17:21.669
- Is there anything else you can tell us?
- Yes.

17:21.671 --> 17:23.772
Kevin Broadus was not in a gang.

17:24.808 --> 17:26.773
How do you know that?

17:26.776 --> 17:29.176
Well, if you knew Kevin, you
would know he wasn't in a gang.

17:29.178 --> 17:33.184
He wrote poetry, collected
books, he was in the jazz band.

17:34.318 --> 17:35.686
Okay. Thank you.

17:37.420 --> 17:38.854
Um, did you get all that?

17:38.856 --> 17:40.588
We appreciate your time.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.758
Will you please send the next person in?

17:44.762 --> 17:46.929
Uh, can I speak with Detective Thompson?

17:47.164 --> 17:49.196
He's not available right now,

17:49.198 --> 17:51.638

I'm sorry.

18:50.426 --> 18:51.893
Sir! I'm really sorry.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.462
I didn't mean to be
disrespectful or interrupt,

18:53.464 --> 18:54.695
but I just had to say something

18:54.697 --> 18:56.798
- that's really important.
- <i>Addison.</i>

18:56.800 --> 18:59.734
I saw Kevin at the coffee shop
yesterday right before it happened.

18:59.736 --> 19:01.536
Actually, Phoebe and I both did.

19:01.538 --> 19:04.505
And then after I heard the
news, I went back to coffee shop,

19:04.507 --> 19:07.709
and one of the news crew guys told me that

19:07.711 --> 19:10.279
they're going to write this
whole thing off as a gang killing.

19:10.281 --> 19:12.780
Which means they probably won't
even go after the guy who did it

19:12.782 --> 19:14.415
because there's such a small chance

19:14.417 --> 19:15.849
of them actually solving the case.

19:15.851 --> 19:17.919
<i>Addison, could you sit down please?</i>

19:17.921 --> 19:20.355
I mean, if anyone here knew Kevin,
they knew he wasn't in a gang.

19:20.357 --> 19:21.822
<i>Addison, please, enough.</i>

19:21.824 --> 19:23.325
I think this is something
we should talk about.

19:23.327 --> 19:25.029
Why am I the only one saying anything?

19:25.262 --> 19:26.728
<i>Addison, please. I've asked
you politely. Sit down!</i>

19:26.730 --> 19:28.763
Does no one care?

19:28.765 --> 19:30.298
<i>I want to hear everything you
have to say, in my office!</i>

19:30.300 --> 19:31.502
All right. Okay.

19:32.936 --> 19:34.636
<i>See me later.</i>

19:39.576 --> 19:41.975
<i>Our emotions are raw.</i>

19:41.977 --> 19:44.311
<i>Everybody in this room is hurting.</i>

19:44.313 --> 19:45.379
Really?

19:45.381 --> 19:46.716
<i>Respect is important.</i>

19:52.555 --> 19:54.621
So what's going on with you?

19:54.623 --> 19:56.390
What do you mean, sir?

19:58.361 --> 20:02.597
Look, there has been a marked
deterioration of your behavior

20:02.599 --> 20:04.335
and your attitude lately.

20:06.503 --> 20:07.605
How are you doing?

20:09.438 --> 20:11.004
I'm fine.

20:12.609 --> 20:15.079
Loss of a parent is a big deal, Addison.

20:16.646 --> 20:19.483
This has nothing to do with my mother, sir.

20:21.584 --> 20:23.417
All right.

20:23.419 --> 20:24.988
Here's what I suggest you do.

20:26.523 --> 20:28.623
Cut the theatrics.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.059
Let the police do their job.

20:31.061 --> 20:32.627
And you work your ass off.

20:32.629 --> 20:34.495
Make your mother proud.

20:34.497 --> 20:36.565
And I'll talk to Chicago.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.103
Tell them what an asset
you are to the school.

20:54.783 --> 20:57.418
<i>- Hey, no cameras in here. Turn it off.
- Sure.</i>

20:57.420 --> 20:59.386
<i>I'm here to see Detective Thompson.</i>

20:59.388 --> 21:00.789
<i>I still see the red light.</i>

21:00.791 --> 21:02.057
<i>Turn it off now.</i>

21:02.059 --> 21:03.459
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

21:03.461 --> 21:04.925
You have an appointment?

21:04.927 --> 21:07.529
Not particularly, but I
need to speak with him.

21:07.531 --> 21:10.398
He's very busy right now.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.769
Okay. I'm going to wait, all right?

21:23.546 --> 21:24.780
Hi, Detective.

21:24.782 --> 21:25.813
So you're the kid with the camera.

21:25.815 --> 21:27.648
Yeah, that's right.

21:27.650 --> 21:29.684
We've got your statement.

21:29.686 --> 21:32.020
I understand that there's
something that you'd like to add.

21:32.022 --> 21:36.691
Yeah. Um, you guys know that Kevin
Broadus was not in a gang, right?

21:36.693 --> 21:38.926
We don't know that.

21:38.928 --> 21:40.895
How do you know that?

21:40.897 --> 21:42.731
Um, well, I mean, I went to...

21:42.733 --> 21:44.699
You know, I've been friends
with him for a while,

21:44.701 --> 21:47.702
and I know that he wasn't in a gang.

21:47.704 --> 21:50.638
Who told you that he was in a gang?

21:50.640 --> 21:53.107
I thought you came here
to tell us something.

21:53.109 --> 21:56.711
I mean, I am here... I just...
I need to know what's going on.

21:56.713 --> 21:58.847
I don't have time for this.
Could you deal with this kid?

21:58.849 --> 22:00.648
- Yeah, I got it.
- Please sir, listen!

22:00.650 --> 22:02.750
My friend just got killed.

22:02.752 --> 22:06.557
And you can't expect me just to sit
around and not do anything about it, okay?

22:09.693 --> 22:13.927
Listen, son. I know he was your friend,

22:13.929 --> 22:17.632
and believe me, we want to catch
whoever did this just as much as you do,

22:17.634 --> 22:21.770
but right now, we're dealing with
24 homicides in this district alone,

22:21.772 --> 22:24.571
and that's just in the past two weeks.

22:24.573 --> 22:26.974
I'm sorry, but if you don't
have anything new to tell us,

22:26.976 --> 22:29.045
I have to get back to work.

22:30.446 --> 22:31.948
Take it easy now.

22:46.596 --> 22:47.631
Hey.

22:55.004 --> 22:57.038
I was looking for you.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.639
You okay?

22:58.641 --> 23:00.143
Yeah, I'm all right.

23:03.179 --> 23:05.515
Do you want to talk about it? Or...

23:07.216 --> 23:09.183
The police have already
made up their minds.

23:09.185 --> 23:10.886
What?

23:10.888 --> 23:12.587
You don't know that.

23:12.589 --> 23:14.088
Listen, Phoebe, one second
we were talking to him,

23:14.090 --> 23:16.656
and the next he's gone. It
just doesn't make any sense.

23:16.658 --> 23:19.961
Everyone is just moving
on like nothing happened.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.128

happened with your mom...

23:30.541 --> 23:32.540
You know, sometimes

23:32.542 --> 23:35.076
bad things, I don't know,
Addy, they just happen.

23:35.078 --> 23:36.245

"Hi, I stole your file,

26:09.131 --> 26:11.199
"and, you know, I would love if
you could talk me through it"?

26:11.201 --> 26:13.734
No, obviously not, but I think
this could lead to something.

26:13.736 --> 26:15.839
What if we could figure this out?

26:20.243 --> 26:22.944
Don't you even care?

26:22.946 --> 26:24.779
That's not what this is about.

26:24.781 --> 26:27.115
Phoebe. Come on. We... Like...

26:27.117 --> 26:29.984
I saw your posters
today outside of the gym.

26:29.986 --> 26:32.086
- I tore them down.
- What? Why?

26:32.088 --> 26:33.988
'Cause, Addison, everyone's
making fun of you.

26:33.990 --> 26:35.990
- They know it's you.
- So you're embarrassed by me?

26:35.992 --> 26:37.157
No, I'm not embarrassed by you.

26:37.159 --> 26:38.826
It's okay to have sex with me,

26:38.828 --> 26:40.860
but you don't want people
to know we're friends?

26:40.862 --> 26:42.731
Of course not! I mean, of course
it's okay that we're friends.

26:42.733 --> 26:43.464
Listen, if you're ashamed
of me, just tell me, okay?

26:43.466 --> 26:45.366
No, you idiot!

26:45.368 --> 26:47.268
I did it because of in spite
of how stupid you're being,

26:47.270 --> 26:49.706
I actually give a shit about you.

26:59.782 --> 27:01.415
Um, can I borrow your
phone? This could be a lead.

27:01.417 --> 27:02.850
Jesus Christ.

27:02.852 --> 27:05.119
Come on! Let me borrow your phone.

27:15.465 --> 27:17.134
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>

27:18.769 --> 27:19.934
Addison?

27:21.038 --> 27:22.039
Addis...

27:23.974 --> 27:27.908
- Who was it?
- I don't know. They hung up.

27:27.910 --> 27:31.913
Addison, you don't seem to realize
that I'm going through this, too.

27:31.915 --> 27:35.282
And I can't stop thinking
about it either, okay? But...

27:37.419 --> 27:39.453
It's not about you.

27:39.455 --> 27:42.859
And there's nothing you
can do to change it, okay?

27:44.494 --> 27:47.097
Now I'm late for class. I gotta go.

28:16.158 --> 28:17.357
<i>Hi, you've
reached the Schacht family,</i>

28:17.359 --> 28:19.493
<i>Sarah, Theo and Addison.</i>

28:19.495 --> 28:21.896
<i>We can't come to
the phone right now.</i>

28:21.898 --> 28:24.538
<i>So leave us a message, and we'll
get back to you as soon as we can.</i>

28:27.003 --> 28:29.937
<i>Uh, hello. This is Principal
Karlstadt at Robert Kennedy High.</i>

28:29.939 --> 28:35.309
<i>I would like, if you can, for you to
come in tomorrow at 8:30 into my office.</i>

28:35.311 --> 28:38.111
<i>It's a matter of some urgency.</i>

28:38.113 --> 28:40.214
Parents and children
should be in touch with each other.

28:40.216 --> 28:41.736
We are in touch with each other.

28:41.784 --> 28:43.317
Through a pager.

28:43.319 --> 28:45.319
Except, he had to use my
daughter's phone to call...

28:45.321 --> 28:47.053
All kids borrow each other's
phone all the time, don't they?

28:47.055 --> 28:49.123
- He doesn't have a cell phone?
- No. Is that a problem?

28:49.125 --> 28:50.565
Why didn't you get him a cell phone?

28:50.792 --> 28:51.992
Okay, let's all calm
down. Let's stay very calm.

28:51.994 --> 28:53.560
It's not a problem. It's a matter of...

28:53.562 --> 28:55.062
- It's a safety issue.
- Could we calm down please?

28:55.064 --> 28:57.063
I'm just trying to make sense of this.

28:57.065 --> 29:00.568
So, his son has put himself

29:00.570 --> 29:02.870
smack dab in the middle of a murder case.

29:02.872 --> 29:04.371
- Am I right?
- Well...

29:04.373 --> 29:06.240
Listen, my son is a good
kid. Can I just say that?

29:06.242 --> 29:07.575
I mean, he's been through
a lot this last year.

29:07.577 --> 29:09.242
Yes.

29:09.244 --> 29:11.311
He's lost his mother and
now he's lost a friend.

29:11.313 --> 29:14.214
What I'm trying to say is that
I think he's just trying to help.

29:14.216 --> 29:17.085
Right. I am not gonna let his kid

29:17.087 --> 29:19.087
jeopardize my daughter's life,

29:19.089 --> 29:20.590
nor her future for that matter.

29:20.822 --> 29:24.191
Okay. I'm gonna stop us right here.

29:24.193 --> 29:28.162
This is a very, very
precarious time for all of us.

29:28.164 --> 29:29.562
So I'd like you to keep that in mind

29:29.564 --> 29:32.299
when you discuss this with your children.

29:32.301 --> 29:34.001
Yes. Of course.

29:34.003 --> 29:36.037
Thank... Thank you for
the meeting, Mr. Karlstadt.

29:36.039 --> 29:39.906
It's been very educational. Thank you.

29:39.908 --> 29:43.210
Okay, I'll speak to you again
after you talk to your children.

29:43.212 --> 29:46.183
Thank you very much. I'll
talk with him tonight.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.921
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi.

29:53.923 --> 29:55.322
You doing okay?

29:55.324 --> 29:57.325
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

29:57.327 --> 29:59.563
Um, so, what's up with
your asshole boyfriend?

30:01.598 --> 30:03.901
It's just that I heard some
weird stuff, that's all.

30:05.068 --> 30:06.267
Do you want to talk about it?

30:06.269 --> 30:08.405
No. Not really.

30:09.238 --> 30:11.540
Oh... Okay.

30:14.276 --> 30:16.511
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:16.513 --> 30:19.146
Uh, could I have a word with you?

30:19.148 --> 30:20.348
Yeah, what's up?

30:20.350 --> 30:22.383
Can I talk to you in private?

30:22.385 --> 30:24.385
Yeah. Sure. Um...

30:24.387 --> 30:27.187
Hey, Alex, will you just watch
my stuff? I'll be right back.

30:27.189 --> 30:28.222
Yeah, sure.

30:28.224 --> 30:29.357
Thanks.

30:29.359 --> 30:31.157
I kind of wanted your advice.

30:31.159 --> 30:32.292
Yeah?

30:32.294 --> 30:33.964
Something to do with Kevin.

30:35.063 --> 30:36.996
Yeah. Um...

30:36.998 --> 30:38.935
I was in the coffee shop when it happened.

30:39.635 --> 30:41.603
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:41.605 --> 30:44.975
I saw something, and I don't
know if I should tell Addison.

30:45.675 --> 30:47.176
Tell him what?

30:48.211 --> 30:49.476
Addison.

30:49.478 --> 30:51.412
Mrs. Strauss. Do you have a minute?

30:51.414 --> 30:52.715
Sure. Come in.

30:52.948 --> 30:55.549
The guy who killed Kevin was white.

30:55.551 --> 30:58.185
I saw his wrist when
he pushed the door open.

30:58.187 --> 31:01.556
I know something was going
on with Kevin before he died.

31:01.558 --> 31:03.523
And I heard that you and him were talking

31:03.525 --> 31:07.161
because he was going through
some emotional difficulties.

31:07.163 --> 31:09.430
So, what do you think it means?

31:09.432 --> 31:11.665
I don't know, but I told the cops,

31:11.667 --> 31:13.466
but I don't think they're
looking in the right place.

31:13.468 --> 31:15.435
Why?

31:15.437 --> 31:17.538
I mean, I heard Kevin was
hanging out with that kid Noel.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.272
- Noel?
- Yeah.

31:19.274 --> 31:22.376
And I know he's mixed up
with some heavy people.

31:22.378 --> 31:23.677
They're dangerous.

31:23.679 --> 31:25.747
What we talked about was confidential.

31:25.982 --> 31:29.549
Just like the conversation we're
having right now is confidential.

31:29.551 --> 31:31.418
Yeah, of course.

31:31.420 --> 31:34.254
But I just want to know
if there's anything,

31:34.256 --> 31:37.090
you know, if you had any idea
of what was going on with him.

31:37.092 --> 31:40.627
Addison, if you want to talk about
how you feel about what's happened,

31:40.629 --> 31:41.763
we can do that.

31:41.997 --> 31:43.598
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.568
Look, just promise me you won't
tell any of this to Addison.

31:47.570 --> 31:50.169
Just not right now, okay?

31:50.171 --> 31:51.440
Yeah. Okay.

31:52.574 --> 31:54.576
- Thanks, Bo.
- Yeah. I'll see you.

31:54.578 --> 31:55.612
Yeah.

31:57.714 --> 31:59.445
I was at your school today.

31:59.447 --> 32:03.486
And I was catching a lot of shit about you.

32:04.587 --> 32:06.056
About this.

32:08.057 --> 32:09.659
What's up with this, hmm?

32:12.061 --> 32:13.562
What's going on?

32:16.532 --> 32:17.767
Addison?

32:20.535 --> 32:22.238
Remember that day

32:24.240 --> 32:25.606
that Kevin was killed?

32:25.608 --> 32:27.407
Yeah.

32:27.409 --> 32:30.478
I drove back to the coffee
shop after it happened.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.616
That's why I didn't call you.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.482
Okay.

32:34.484 --> 32:36.149
And I...

32:36.151 --> 32:38.752
I saw his body.

32:38.754 --> 32:41.457
Yeah, I saw Kevin. Like,
I saw them wheel him out.

32:43.493 --> 32:45.492
Here's this kid.

32:45.494 --> 32:47.293
He gets murdered,

32:47.295 --> 32:48.797
and no one cares.

32:49.031 --> 32:50.598
That's not true, Addy.
You know that's not true.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.099
No, it is! That's what it seems like.

32:52.101 --> 32:54.236
People care. They do. They just...

32:55.503 --> 32:57.504
Will you just do me a favor?

32:57.506 --> 33:00.406
Just stop this nonsense. This
is... This is crazy, Addison.

33:00.408 --> 33:02.643
It's not nonsense. I'm just
trying to do something good.

33:02.645 --> 33:06.280
Yeah, I... I understand, I think
I do, what you're trying to do.

33:06.282 --> 33:08.683
But this is a murder investigation.

33:08.685 --> 33:10.384
You don't know what could happen.

33:10.386 --> 33:12.153
Nothing's gonna happen!

33:12.155 --> 33:15.125
Well, I couldn't take it if
anything did happen to you.

33:19.396 --> 33:20.761
Just...

33:20.763 --> 33:23.330
If you can't do it for me,

33:23.332 --> 33:24.734
do it for her.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.434
All right?

33:27.436 --> 33:28.571
Yeah.

33:39.682 --> 33:42.416
<i>Video Diary. Day 23.</i>

33:42.418 --> 33:44.284
<i>I don't know, maybe my dad's right.</i>

33:44.286 --> 33:45.566
<i>Maybe I'm not thinking straight.</i>

33:49.559 --> 33:53.394
Maybe I shouldn't forget
about the rest of my life.

33:53.396 --> 33:54.397
Phoebe!

33:56.666 --> 33:57.731
Hey.

33:57.733 --> 33:59.299
What's up?

33:59.301 --> 34:00.302
Hi.

34:03.805 --> 34:04.907
What?

34:07.377 --> 34:14.748
Look. So, I know the other night
was purely a practical thing for you.

34:14.750 --> 34:17.819
And, you know, I have
nothing to compare it to,

34:17.821 --> 34:20.554
except for maybe porn and stuff.

34:20.556 --> 34:22.458
But I just have to say

34:23.793 --> 34:27.194
that it really was sensational,

34:27.196 --> 34:29.697
in the original meaning of the word.

34:29.699 --> 34:32.835
And I have a strong and overwhelming desire

34:33.735 --> 34:35.538
to do it again.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.675
That's bad, huh?

34:42.677 --> 34:44.647
Well, you know,

34:46.616 --> 34:50.451
when I woke up this morning, I...

34:50.453 --> 34:53.790
I looked over at the pillow
where your head had been.

34:54.757 --> 34:55.822
Uh...

34:55.824 --> 34:56.826
And I...

34:58.728 --> 35:01.665
And I kind of wished it was still there.

35:10.739 --> 35:12.773
I don't know, we're probably

35:12.775 --> 35:15.375
- just romanticizing it.
- Romanticizing it. Yeah. That's classic.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.512
But, uh...

35:18.514 --> 35:20.648
Maybe if we did it again...

35:20.650 --> 35:22.918
What? It might break the spell?

35:24.286 --> 35:26.387
That works.

35:26.389 --> 35:28.355
- Should we...
- Yeah.

35:28.357 --> 35:29.458
Okay.

35:32.527 --> 35:34.427
Are you sure your dad's not home?

35:34.429 --> 35:36.262
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.666
He's out shooting bridges for
a Belgian tourist brochure.

35:38.668 --> 35:40.770
Long way from the
<i>Washington Post, huh?</i>

35:47.409 --> 35:48.511
What?

35:50.346 --> 35:53.848
That... That
was pretty good. Right?

35:53.850 --> 35:55.949
I mean, what do you think?

35:55.951 --> 35:57.686
Better, same?

35:59.422 --> 36:00.557
Worse?

36:02.324 --> 36:04.625
Not worse, but...

36:04.627 --> 36:06.460
Okay.

36:06.462 --> 36:09.032
I mean, the spell is definitely broken.

36:10.565 --> 36:11.567
Yeah.

36:14.536 --> 36:15.705
Really?

36:23.746 --> 36:25.615
No, Addy.

36:28.683 --> 36:30.719
I want you to hold me.

36:45.735 --> 36:47.869
Is it just a one-time
thing? I mean, like...

36:47.871 --> 36:51.505
I mean, if we do do this
again, which I hope we will,

36:51.507 --> 36:56.012
I mean, like, do you want to usually
do the holding afterwards or beforehand?

36:57.813 --> 37:00.082
Usually afterwards, I'm
guessing. That's good.

37:01.484 --> 37:03.384
I'm just curious, you know.

37:03.386 --> 37:05.554
- I want to be...
- Shut up.

37:06.022 --> 37:07.324
Okay.

37:10.292 --> 37:12.360
Okay. Um...

37:12.362 --> 37:14.097
So, what? I guess we just keep...

37:14.330 --> 37:16.896
We keep doing this until
the feeling wears off?

37:16.898 --> 37:19.465
Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

37:19.467 --> 37:20.569
Okay.

37:25.842 --> 37:27.840
How are you getting home?

37:27.842 --> 37:30.202
I'm gonna grab a cab. Don't
worry about it. It's fine, okay?

37:35.551 --> 37:36.884
Hi.

37:36.886 --> 37:37.987
Hey.

37:39.788 --> 37:41.121
I brought dinner.

37:41.123 --> 37:43.056
Um, I already ate actually, but thank you.

37:43.058 --> 37:44.523
Okay.

37:44.525 --> 37:45.828
How was your trip?

37:46.828 --> 37:47.930
Good.

37:49.665 --> 37:51.066
How was class?

37:52.400 --> 37:53.733
Fine.

37:53.735 --> 37:57.637
I learned five more ways to say "hello."

37:57.639 --> 38:00.407
It was eventful.

38:00.409 --> 38:02.878
Should we talk about Addison Schacht?

38:03.913 --> 38:05.679
Wow!

38:05.681 --> 38:07.815
- You really have people everywhere, huh?
- Really?

38:07.817 --> 38:09.583
Addison Schacht. Okay.

38:09.585 --> 38:10.951
What?

38:10.953 --> 38:12.820
What's the problem?

38:12.822 --> 38:15.956
We moved up the hill and they moved down.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.657
I went in to your school yesterday,

38:17.659 --> 38:21.163
and I had a meeting with Karlstadt.

38:21.397 --> 38:24.665
He told me about Addison's
so-called "investigation"

38:24.667 --> 38:27.634
into the Broadus murder
and your involvement in it.

38:27.636 --> 38:29.737
I'm not involved in it.

38:29.739 --> 38:31.840
He's a friend of mine. That's it.

38:33.442 --> 38:34.775
So he's just a friend, huh?

38:34.777 --> 38:37.146
What does it matter?

38:37.380 --> 38:39.079
What do you have against him?

38:39.081 --> 38:41.148
It's not his fault that
his life has been so shitty.

38:41.150 --> 38:42.683
His mom died.

38:42.685 --> 38:44.451
I'm not talking about his mother dying.

38:44.453 --> 38:47.822
I'm talking about you pulling
this shit with your friend.

38:47.824 --> 38:50.590
And I just don't want you
to get involved in something

38:50.592 --> 38:53.128
that will most definitely hurt you.

38:56.699 --> 38:59.836

<i>Addison Schacht to the
Principal's office.</i>

40:06.636 --> 40:08.869
That's it, Addison. Last chance.

40:08.871 --> 40:10.103
What happened?

40:10.105 --> 40:11.038
They're suspending me for a week.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.239
What?

40:13.241 --> 40:15.141
Because they looked in my locker for
posters and they found Kevin's file.

40:15.143 --> 40:17.613
Okay. Well, what are you
going to do about it?

40:19.781 --> 40:22.215
Now I've got nothing to lose.

40:22.217 --> 40:24.016
Addison, they didn't expel you, okay?

40:24.018 --> 40:27.219
Just go home and... And chill out.

40:27.221 --> 40:29.958
They might not put it on your record.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.505
<i>A suspect

<i>Sunday
morning at 4:30,</i>

40:37.933 --> 40:40.567

40:40.569 --> 40:41.902

40:46.574 --> 40:49.175
<i>whose killer fled the scene

41:22.911 --> 41:24.844
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:24.846 --> 41:27.081
Um, is Addison home?

41:27.083 --> 41:30.753
No. Well, he should be, but no, he's not.

41:31.286 --> 41:32.786
Phoebe?

41:32.788 --> 41:34.020
- Yeah.
- Oh!

41:34.022 --> 41:35.956
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:35.958 --> 41:37.958
Well, why don't you come in? Yeah, yeah.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.159
Come on in.

41:39.161 --> 41:40.630
Yeah, okay. Um...

41:45.167 --> 41:49.737
Don't mind me. It's chili night, and
things tend to get out of control.

41:49.739 --> 41:52.105
Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

41:52.107 --> 41:54.177
So, how are you doing?

41:54.842 --> 41:56.342
Um...

41:56.344 --> 41:59.779
I'm okay. You know, considering everything.

41:59.781 --> 42:00.817
Yeah, I'm sure.

42:01.951 --> 42:04.817
Do you want to sit down? Yeah.

42:04.819 --> 42:07.119
- Sure. I don't mind standing, though, it's...
- Here.

42:07.121 --> 42:09.056
No...

42:09.058 --> 42:11.824
Some of this stuff out of the way here.

42:11.826 --> 42:13.826
Don't mind the mess.

42:13.828 --> 42:15.061
It's okay.

42:15.063 --> 42:16.663
How's your mom?

42:16.665 --> 42:19.368
- You've known her for a while, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

42:19.601 --> 42:23.136
Yeah, since... Well, since
she first came to Washington.

42:23.138 --> 42:25.371
That's almost 20 years now.

42:25.373 --> 42:29.208
Was she always so...

42:29.210 --> 42:32.112
I don't know, like that?

42:32.114 --> 42:34.681
Your mom's a perfectionist.

42:34.683 --> 42:37.150
But she's had to work real
hard to get where she's at,

42:37.152 --> 42:40.289
and you seem to be turning out pretty good.

42:42.824 --> 42:44.991
How do you think Addy's doing?

42:44.993 --> 42:47.694
I don't know actually.

42:47.696 --> 42:49.232
You know, I hope he's okay.

42:56.971 --> 42:58.073
Addy?

43:00.109 --> 43:02.342
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

43:02.344 --> 43:04.143
I saved some chili.

43:04.145 --> 43:06.880
Uh, I'm not really hungry.
I'm just gonna go to my room.

43:06.882 --> 43:08.284
Hi, Addy.

43:17.326 --> 43:19.125
What are you doing here?

43:19.127 --> 43:20.393
Oh, we're just having
some ice cream. Want some?

43:20.395 --> 43:21.997
Just waiting on you.

43:23.732 --> 43:25.435
Addison, come on!

43:27.670 --> 43:28.838
Hey!

43:34.208 --> 43:35.444
Addison?

43:36.878 --> 43:38.378
Can I come in?

43:40.415 --> 43:42.882
You have a nice little
chat about me with my dad?

43:42.884 --> 43:45.018
Come on, Addison.

43:45.020 --> 43:47.154
Look, I'm just worried about you.

43:47.156 --> 43:49.355
Well, if you came here to try to
talk me out of doing anything crazy,

43:49.357 --> 43:51.025
- don't bother.
- That's not why I'm here.

43:51.027 --> 43:54.027
I just came back from the police station.

43:54.029 --> 43:57.132
And it was a complete waste of time.

43:59.701 --> 44:00.866
I'm kidding myself.

44:00.868 --> 44:02.469
No one's gonna solve this case,

44:02.471 --> 44:05.174
and there's sure as shit
nothing I can do about it.

44:11.846 --> 44:14.114
All right. I heard something.

44:14.116 --> 44:17.784
And I don't know if it's true or not,

44:17.786 --> 44:20.788
but I've thought about it
and I can't not tell you.

44:20.790 --> 44:22.889
- What?
- You can't overreact, all right?

44:22.891 --> 44:24.424
Because I don't even know
if it means anything yet.

44:24.426 --> 44:25.737
I'm just giving you the information.

44:25.761 --> 44:27.259
Yeah, what is it?

44:27.261 --> 44:28.895
The guy was white.

44:28.897 --> 44:30.329
The guy who killed Kevin.

44:30.331 --> 44:32.935
Bo saw him. He said he was white.

44:34.270 --> 44:36.402
What do you think, it was a race thing?

44:36.404 --> 44:40.007
I don't know. Honestly, I don't think so.

44:40.009 --> 44:43.076
Bo said that Kevin was hanging around
with some pretty dangerous people.

44:43.078 --> 44:44.244
Who?

44:44.246 --> 44:46.048
Do you remember that kid Noel?

44:47.081 --> 44:48.551
Fat Noel from eighth grade?

44:48.784 --> 44:50.951
Yeah. That's who Kevin
was hanging around with.

44:50.953 --> 44:53.119
Phoebe, just because Noel listened
to gangster rap when we were younger

44:53.121 --> 44:54.855
doesn't make him dangerous.

44:54.857 --> 44:56.456
All right, Addison. Well,
look, that's what Bo told me.

44:56.458 --> 44:58.698
He said Kevin was mixed up
with some pretty heavy people.

44:58.793 --> 45:00.092
So there. I told you.

45:00.094 --> 45:02.496
Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

45:02.498 --> 45:05.398
Um, do you have Noel's number?

45:05.400 --> 45:06.866
Why would I have Noel's number?

45:06.868 --> 45:08.869
I don't... I don't know.

45:08.871 --> 45:11.840
Do you think, um... Do you
think Noel still has a Facebook?

45:14.176 --> 45:17.043
Okay, so it's Tuesday night, around 11:15.

45:17.045 --> 45:19.413
<i>We're on our way to see
our old friend Noel.</i>

45:19.415 --> 45:22.382
<i>Earlier tonight, Phoebe told
me that he might know something</i>

45:22.384 --> 45:24.183
<i>about what happened to Kevin.</i>

45:24.185 --> 45:28.487
<i>So, he invited us to this
address, 267 Otis Street.</i>

45:28.489 --> 45:31.558
Um, this is... This is Otis Street here.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.259
Wait, who are these guys? Maybe this is it.

45:33.261 --> 45:35.128
<i>I don't think this is it.</i>

45:35.130 --> 45:36.862
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
We're good. We're good.</i>

45:36.864 --> 45:38.431
<i>Addison, this
is super sketchy.</i>

45:38.433 --> 45:40.000
<i>If they see that we're,
you know, stressed out,</i>

45:40.002 --> 45:41.201
<i>they're gonna think it's weird.</i>

45:41.203 --> 45:43.003
<i>Just, you know, stay calm.</i>

45:44.272 --> 45:45.538
<i>- Shit! Shit! Shit!
- Go! Go!</i>

45:45.540 --> 45:47.074
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

45:47.076 --> 45:49.043
<i>Why the hell are we down here?</i>

45:49.045 --> 45:50.344
<i>Just give me the
address. What's the address again?</i>

45:50.346 --> 45:51.911
<i>Addison, why are you turning...</i>

45:51.913 --> 45:53.145
<i>No, that's
it. That should be it.</i>

45:53.147 --> 45:54.514
<i>There? That's an alleyway.</i>

45:54.516 --> 45:55.514
Relax, okay? It's gonna be fine.

45:55.516 --> 45:57.116
I'm not gonna relax.

45:57.118 --> 45:58.884
It's gonna be fine. We know him.

45:58.886 --> 46:00.454
- We don't know Noel.
- Yes, we do!

46:00.456 --> 46:02.155
We went to school with him for so long!

46:02.157 --> 46:04.090
- You saw Noel five years ago.
- Five, so what?

46:04.092 --> 46:06.360
- Five years ago.
- Do you see where we are right now?

46:06.362 --> 46:07.994
Fine. You can wait in the car then.

46:07.996 --> 46:10.099
No way. I'm not doing that.

46:15.103 --> 46:17.404
Is this really
where Noel's friend lives?

46:17.406 --> 46:19.105
What's his name again?

46:19.107 --> 46:21.041
He said to ask
for some guy named D. Cash.

46:26.982 --> 46:28.351
Yo, you got visitors.

46:31.453 --> 46:33.520
Come on in.

46:33.522 --> 46:37.226
Take your hands out your pockets,
man. You're making me nervous.

46:39.994 --> 46:41.494
- So, you're Addison.
- Yeah.

46:41.496 --> 46:43.232
- I'm D.
- Hey, man. Good to meet you.

46:47.869 --> 46:49.503
What's your name, baby? Who is this?

46:49.505 --> 46:51.570
You brought me a little gift right here?

46:51.572 --> 46:53.373
I'm Phoebe.

46:53.375 --> 46:55.375
- Phoebe.
- Yeah.

46:55.377 --> 46:57.476
- You want to have some fun?
- I'm okay.

46:57.478 --> 46:58.480
She's with me, man.

46:59.947 --> 47:01.215
Mmm?

47:01.217 --> 47:03.550
- I'm okay.
- What'd you say?

47:03.552 --> 47:06.152
She's... She's with me.

47:06.154 --> 47:08.487
Man, I will slap your
nose off your face, man.

47:08.489 --> 47:10.123
Shut up, Addison.

47:10.125 --> 47:12.391
Yeah, you heard her.
You better shut up, dude.

47:12.393 --> 47:13.395
All right.

47:14.563 --> 47:16.032
Hey, your friend's here.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.967
Noel, wake up, man.

47:20.969 --> 47:24.070
Hey, get your ass up,
Noel. They're here. Wake up.

47:25.273 --> 47:26.308
Is that Noel?

47:27.208 --> 47:29.208
Who's this bitch?

47:29.210 --> 47:30.947
Hey man, it's Addison.

47:32.514 --> 47:36.118
Addison, yeah. Good to see you, man.

47:38.453 --> 47:40.454
You look like shit.

47:40.456 --> 47:42.158
Well, sit down, man.

47:46.494 --> 47:48.661
Uh, so, how you been, man?

47:48.663 --> 47:51.663
You high already man. I'll
take this. Put that shit down.

47:51.665 --> 47:53.166
It's crazy, right?

47:53.168 --> 47:55.337
It's been, like, five years, six years.

47:57.105 --> 47:59.505
Why are you so interested all of a sudden?

47:59.507 --> 48:01.442
Well, um, the reason why I'm here

48:01.444 --> 48:04.277
is because I wanted to
ask you about something.

48:04.279 --> 48:07.079
- Okay. Uh...
- Uh...

48:07.081 --> 48:10.616
The shooting in Northwest at Seven Stars.

48:10.618 --> 48:14.022
I don't know if you know or
not, but this kid Kevin Broadus,

48:15.690 --> 48:18.659
who we know, he was the one who got killed.

48:18.661 --> 48:21.594
Yeah, what are you asking me for?

48:21.596 --> 48:26.334
Well, I... I heard, you know,
you guys were hanging out.

48:27.603 --> 48:30.304
So, what do you think happened?

48:30.306 --> 48:33.172
I mean, we just heard that
the guy who did it was white...

48:33.174 --> 48:35.175
Enough of this shit, man.

48:35.177 --> 48:36.745
Enough.

48:36.978 --> 48:38.746
Noel, you got this kid's number?

48:39.014 --> 48:40.145
No.

48:40.147 --> 48:41.749
I have a pager.

48:41.984 --> 48:43.451
You got a pager.

48:45.054 --> 48:46.386
Where you live, son?

48:46.388 --> 48:48.255
Uh, we're actually from Philadelphia.

48:48.257 --> 48:50.355
We're just visiting.

48:50.357 --> 48:52.358
I know where he lives. You're still
at the same place, right, Addy?

48:52.360 --> 48:54.360
Yeah. Same place.

48:54.362 --> 48:55.972
Good. I think you kids better
get going, man. Get out of here.

48:55.996 --> 48:57.197
No problem.

48:57.199 --> 48:59.331
If we hear something, who knows?

48:59.333 --> 49:01.201
Maybe we'll give you a call.

49:01.203 --> 49:02.402
All right, white boy?

49:02.404 --> 49:05.337
Okay. Thank you. I'll send him my number.

49:05.339 --> 49:08.509
Get your ass home, man.

49:08.511 --> 49:11.078
<i>Why the hell would
you tell them where you live?</i>

49:11.080 --> 49:12.813
Noel still thinks we live in Chevy Chase.

49:13.047 --> 49:15.382
We used to be rich, remember?

49:15.384 --> 49:17.152
Well, that's just great.

49:20.188 --> 49:21.790
Phoebe. I'm really sorry.

49:22.022 --> 49:23.523
- I don't want to hear it from you.
- Okay? I... I am.

49:23.525 --> 49:25.293
- I don't want to hear it!
- Okay.

49:30.766 --> 49:32.401
I need a break.

49:33.502 --> 49:35.503
I can't keep doing this.

49:37.406 --> 49:39.739
I can't be a part of this anymore.

50:24.219 --> 50:25.688
Yeah, hello. Who is this?

50:26.755 --> 50:28.855
Oh, yeah. Yes. This is he.

50:28.857 --> 50:30.190
Yeah, no.

50:30.192 --> 50:32.161
Thank you, sir, for calling.

50:33.795 --> 50:34.830
Yes.

50:36.598 --> 50:38.599
Okay.

50:38.601 --> 50:41.268
Okay. I'll see you then.

50:41.270 --> 50:43.436
Phoebe! Hi. I'm in here.

50:43.438 --> 50:46.306
Listen, I'm hanging up, all right?
Call me if you start to panic.

50:46.308 --> 50:47.309
Bye.

50:48.643 --> 50:49.875
- Good morning.
- Hey.

50:49.877 --> 50:51.578
Can we talk for a minute?

50:51.580 --> 50:53.579
We can talk later. I gotta go.

50:53.581 --> 50:55.551
It'll only take a minute.

50:57.453 --> 50:58.717
Okay.

50:58.719 --> 51:00.353
Well,

51:00.355 --> 51:02.725
Addison Schacht's father
called me last night.

51:04.759 --> 51:05.894
Yeah?

51:06.127 --> 51:09.429
It was kind of illuminating.

51:09.431 --> 51:11.697
I have to admit. I didn't...

51:11.699 --> 51:13.599
I hated the fact that he knows

51:13.601 --> 51:16.471
more about what my own
daughter is doing than I do.

51:17.471 --> 51:19.507
Did you like it over there?

51:20.509 --> 51:21.911
I mean, yeah.

51:23.578 --> 51:25.777
I don't know, Mom. It was... It was fine.

51:25.779 --> 51:27.279
Theo's a nice guy.

51:27.281 --> 51:29.616
Yeah, he's a nice person.

51:29.618 --> 51:31.918
It's true.

51:31.920 --> 51:35.523
- Okay, well...
- I just want to say that I'm... I'm...

51:38.326 --> 51:39.759
What?

51:39.761 --> 51:43.498
What I want to say is I
apologize. I'm very sorry

51:45.366 --> 51:47.900
for not listening to you.

51:47.902 --> 51:50.670
Sincerely, my intention was to help.

51:56.310 --> 51:59.380
I'm gonna head out. I
love you, Mom. I gotta go.

52:00.348 --> 52:01.817
I love you, too.

52:04.685 --> 52:05.753
<i>Okay.</i>

52:07.822 --> 52:08.891
<i>Here we are.</i>

52:09.891 --> 52:12.761
<i>Uh, 775 McKinley.</i>

52:16.797 --> 52:18.399
<i>Kevin's house.</i>

52:18.967 --> 52:20.500
<i>Uh...</i>

52:28.743 --> 52:29.978
Hi, Mr. Broadus.

52:30.212 --> 52:31.847
You must be Addison.

52:32.647 --> 52:33.849
Come inside.

52:43.958 --> 52:47.360
Would you like something to drink?

52:47.362 --> 52:48.998
I'm okay. Thank you.

52:52.634 --> 52:54.534
So,

52:54.536 --> 52:56.969
you're a friend of Kevin's?

52:56.971 --> 52:59.473
Yeah, I'd definitely say we were friends.

52:59.475 --> 53:03.309
Enough of a friend to
go to all this trouble?

53:03.311 --> 53:05.645
Sorry to be blunt, but the
fact is we'd like to know

53:05.647 --> 53:08.547
why you're taking such an interest.

53:08.549 --> 53:11.286
Do you think the police
aren't doing their job?

53:13.422 --> 53:15.991
- But...
- Then why are you so interested?

53:20.494 --> 53:22.862
Well, I...

53:22.864 --> 53:29.371
I guess it just doesn't really make any
sense why anyone would want to kill Kevin.

53:35.710 --> 53:39.014
Sorry. I'm so sorry. It's
my dad. I'll turn it off.

53:42.683 --> 53:43.750
Walter?

53:43.752 --> 53:45.321
Come with me.

53:46.420 --> 53:47.790
Come with me.

53:49.391 --> 53:50.592
Walter.

54:04.505 --> 54:07.040
My son valued his privacy.

54:07.042 --> 54:09.074
He kept us out of here for the last year.

54:09.076 --> 54:10.976
We had to break the locks.

54:10.978 --> 54:13.781
Then when my wife could
finally face coming in here...

54:21.056 --> 54:22.523
She had to find this.

54:22.991 --> 54:24.092
Open it.

54:24.793 --> 54:25.794
Open it!

54:28.362 --> 54:29.561
What is this?

54:29.563 --> 54:30.766
You want a reason?

54:32.067 --> 54:34.701
- There's your reason.
- What is that?

54:34.703 --> 54:36.436
- Look at me!
- I don't know what that is!

54:36.438 --> 54:37.603
- Why do you have a pager?
- What?

54:37.605 --> 54:38.737
- Are you a dealer?
- No.

54:38.739 --> 54:40.105
Were you supplying my son?

54:40.107 --> 54:41.541
- No. Absolutely not!
- Tell me!

54:41.543 --> 54:42.675
Walter, stop!

54:42.677 --> 54:43.712
Please.

54:44.913 --> 54:46.746
Stop! Please!

54:55.924 --> 54:57.960
What do you want from us, Addison?

54:59.828 --> 55:02.598
You want to know why my son was killed?

55:05.632 --> 55:07.402
I don't know why.

55:10.071 --> 55:13.609
But maybe we're just going to
have to learn to live with that.

55:20.514 --> 55:23.016
I'm so sorry.

55:23.018 --> 55:25.753
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to make it worse.

Um, excuse me.

57:15.763 --> 57:17.063
- Hi.
- Hey.

57:17.065 --> 57:19.197
- Hi. What's going on?
- I need to talk to you.

57:19.199 --> 57:22.134
- Addy, this is a really bad time.
- I need to talk to you.

57:22.136 --> 57:23.705
Shit. Okay, just come on.

57:26.040 --> 57:28.107
Addy, what? What's up?

57:29.576 --> 57:31.777
I just came back from Kevin's house.

57:31.779 --> 57:34.579
You know he was into
drugs? Like, serious drugs?

57:34.581 --> 57:36.815
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

57:36.817 --> 57:39.686
I don't know. Maybe that's what Strauss
meant by "emotional difficulties."

57:39.688 --> 57:41.087
Phoebe.

57:41.089 --> 57:42.857
Uh, hey.

57:44.192 --> 57:47.694
I'm sorry, Mom. Just one second.

57:47.696 --> 57:49.862
- Addy, I gotta go. I...
- Wait. I just...

57:49.864 --> 57:51.300
Phoebe! Please.

57:53.734 --> 57:55.337
Addy, what is it?

57:58.706 --> 58:03.345
You know, I never told you what
happened that day with my mom.

58:05.013 --> 58:06.047
No.

58:09.250 --> 58:10.819
She was fine.

58:12.286 --> 58:15.621
Nothing was wrong with her.

58:15.623 --> 58:17.325
That morning, we were having breakfast,

58:17.558 --> 58:20.661
and then I went to school,
and when I came back she was...

58:23.031 --> 58:24.299
It's okay.

58:26.299 --> 58:31.003
She was still sitting in the
same seat where I left her.

58:31.005 --> 58:35.110
At the hospital, they told
us that she'd had an aneurysm.

58:37.578 --> 58:39.344
Then,

58:39.346 --> 58:42.848
last week, we see Kevin at the coffee shop.

58:42.850 --> 58:44.918
- He gave us our coffee.
- Addison.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.152
He gave me back my book.

58:46.154 --> 58:47.686
It's not the same thing.

58:47.688 --> 58:48.991
Yes. It is.

58:50.023 --> 58:51.859
It is the same thing.

58:54.127 --> 58:55.930
He was fine, too.

58:58.799 --> 59:00.333
Don't you understand, Phoebe?

59:00.335 --> 59:02.337
I couldn't do anything about her.

59:04.772 --> 59:07.038
Addison.

59:07.040 --> 59:11.212
I don't know. Maybe I'm trying to
solve something that can't be solved.

59:12.380 --> 59:13.815
Addison.

59:56.424 --> 59:59.257
<i>Addison. Uh...</i>

59:59.259 --> 01:00:01.360
<i>Man, give
me the damn phone.</i>

01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:03.029
<i>Yo, it's D.</i>

01:00:03.031 --> 01:00:05.398
<i>We got something you
might want to know, man.</i>

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.069
<i>Meet us in an hour.</i>

01:00:22.282 --> 01:00:24.817
Hey. No alcohol for minors.

01:00:24.819 --> 01:00:27.022
No, we're good. Kid's with me.

01:00:34.895 --> 01:00:37.195
So, where's the girl at?

01:00:37.197 --> 01:00:39.033
You said you got something for me?

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.803
We got something for you. It's right here.

01:00:46.241 --> 01:00:49.308
Just little errands, man. No big deal.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:52.446
Look, you do this for us,
you get a name. That simple.

01:00:54.382 --> 01:00:58.016
Are you kidding me? I'm
not... I'm not gonna do that.

01:00:58.018 --> 01:01:00.087
Do I look like I'm kidding, hmm?

01:01:03.123 --> 01:01:06.494
Hmm? Okay, well, you don't want to
know nothing, man. I'm out of here.

01:01:08.063 --> 01:01:09.228
Go back.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.398
Hold on.

01:01:13.467 --> 01:01:15.503
Thatta boy. Yeah.

01:01:18.005 --> 01:01:20.105
Now we talking.

01:01:20.107 --> 01:01:21.808
You're saying if I do this for you,

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:24.045
you're going to tell me
who killed Kevin Broadus?

01:01:24.444 --> 01:01:26.244
No.

01:01:26.246 --> 01:01:29.317
But I will tell you the guy
who knows the guy who did it.

01:01:31.451 --> 01:01:33.554
Okay. And...

01:01:33.788 --> 01:01:35.186
Where do I have to take it?

01:01:35.188 --> 01:01:37.322
Back to your neighborhood.

01:01:37.324 --> 01:01:39.291
We can't go down there, man.

01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:41.125
Not in Chevy.

01:01:41.127 --> 01:01:43.929
Police would be on our
ass so tough. Sniff us out.

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:45.331
But a kid like you?

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:46.465
Golden.

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:48.170
Yeah, and crispy.

01:01:51.339 --> 01:01:53.371
No. I'm gonna need a little more info.

01:01:53.373 --> 01:01:56.509
I told you. I told you.
Addy's a quick learner, man.

01:01:56.511 --> 01:01:58.444
He's a quick learner. He ain't
even got hair on his nuts.

01:01:58.446 --> 01:01:59.911
Look at him.

01:01:59.913 --> 01:02:01.380
Give him... Give him a taste.

01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:03.148
Give him a taste.
Okay. Let me tell you.

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.918
There's a guy, you know. He
comes down, hangs out sometimes.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.520
Smack dealer from Maryland.

01:02:07.522 --> 01:02:09.322
He's out of his mind. He's...

01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:10.523
You know, he comes into D.C.
and he parties at the clubs.

01:02:10.525 --> 01:02:12.594
- That's what he likes to do.
- Yeah.

01:02:12.826 --> 01:02:14.771
And according to our friend, Kevin
was down there to buy some shit.

01:02:14.795 --> 01:02:16.395
So dealer was sitting in
his big chair, you know.

01:02:16.397 --> 01:02:18.998
He's sitting in the room with
all his homies at a table.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.534
You know, he see Kevin. He decides
to pick on him a little bit.

01:02:21.536 --> 01:02:23.503
Nothing too serious.

01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:25.471
The next thing you know, Kevin
went right back at the guy,

01:02:25.473 --> 01:02:28.206
and shit, man. Like he
was going back and forth.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:29.541
It made the guy look bad.

01:02:29.543 --> 01:02:31.076
Bad. Real bad.

01:02:31.078 --> 01:02:33.145
This kid disrespected the wrong guy.

01:02:33.147 --> 01:02:35.248
Disrespected him, man.
I don't even know what Kevin said,

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.483
but he said something
because he got a big laugh.

01:02:38.485 --> 01:02:41.922
I mean, he... He signed
his own death warrant. Shit.

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.991
When... When was this?

01:02:45.993 --> 01:02:48.262
A couple of days before he got shot.

01:02:52.299 --> 01:02:56.434
You're saying that all he did

01:02:56.436 --> 01:02:59.174
was say the wrong thing to the wrong guy?

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.243
Wrong damn thing, man.

01:03:38.011 --> 01:03:39.313
Oh, my God.

01:03:53.493 --> 01:03:54.696
Addison?

01:03:54.929 --> 01:03:56.395
Alex?

01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:57.663
- Uh...
- What the hell are you doing here?

01:03:57.665 --> 01:03:59.098
Is this 27... I think I have the...

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.099
Shit. Really?

01:04:01.101 --> 01:04:03.101
Alex, who is it?

01:04:03.103 --> 01:04:05.371
Uh, okay. Okay. Um...

01:04:05.373 --> 01:04:08.007
Just act normal like I
left my sports bag at school

01:04:08.009 --> 01:04:09.074
and you're dropping it off as a favor.

01:04:09.076 --> 01:04:10.509
This for you?

01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:12.110
Just give it to me for God's sake.

01:04:12.112 --> 01:04:14.413
All right. Thank you. Bye!

01:04:14.415 --> 01:04:17.282
No, you're funny. Get
the hell out of here. Go. All right.

01:04:17.284 --> 01:04:18.386
See you later!

01:04:23.056 --> 01:04:26.692
Hey, D. I did it. What's the name?

01:04:26.694 --> 01:04:29.395
<i>What name? What
are you talking about, man?</i>

01:04:29.397 --> 01:04:31.262
Come on, D. What's
the name? We had a deal.

01:04:31.264 --> 01:04:33.398
<i>Don't rush me, man.</i>

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.168
<i>Now, the guy we told you
about, his name is Mike.</i>

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:38.003
<i>Mike Lorriner.</i>

01:04:38.005 --> 01:04:40.072
<i>He was there when Kevin got
into it with that dealer.</i>

01:04:40.074 --> 01:04:41.794
And what's the address?

01:04:47.147 --> 01:04:49.348
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Phoebe! Phoebe. Mike Lorriner.

01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:52.518
Write this down, okay? Mike
Lorriner. 9756 Fork Lute Road.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.755
This is the guy who knows
who did it. D. just told me.

01:04:54.989 --> 01:04:56.688
<i>Okay. So you already
called the police, right?</i>

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.556
No, no, no. It's fine. I'm
just gonna go talk to him.

01:04:58.558 --> 01:05:00.326
<i>Addison, don't be
stupid. Do not go there.</i>

01:05:00.328 --> 01:05:02.427
<i>Just give the police the
address and let them go.</i>

01:05:02.429 --> 01:05:04.429
- Phoebe, I got it covered.
- <i>Addison!</i>

01:06:31.252 --> 01:06:33.184
Hey.

01:06:33.186 --> 01:06:35.223
Uh, hi. Are you Mike Lorriner?

01:06:37.491 --> 01:06:39.257
- Who are you?
- Um...

01:06:39.259 --> 01:06:43.628
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to bother you, but...

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:47.299
I heard that you knew something
about what happened in D.C.

01:06:47.301 --> 01:06:48.800
a few days ago.

01:06:48.802 --> 01:06:51.304
You know, the kid who got
shot at the coffee shop.

01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:53.605
D.C.? I don't know anything, man.

01:06:53.607 --> 01:06:55.275
It's about Kevin Broadus.

01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:58.677
Uh, he was a friend of mine.

01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:00.746
I don't know what you're talking
about, man. Get out of here.

01:07:00.748 --> 01:07:02.348
I heard that he pissed off a drug
dealer or something, and you...

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:04.349
Do you know the guy?

01:07:04.351 --> 01:07:06.617
I don't know, I just... I just...
What did I just say to you?

01:07:06.619 --> 01:07:08.420
Did you hear me?

01:07:08.422 --> 01:07:11.655
I... I said, I... I...
I don't know nothing.

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:13.659
- All right? Now... Now just get...
- All right.

01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:15.194
Get off my property.

01:07:15.196 --> 01:07:17.596
Okay. Sorry, man. I'll go. I'm leaving.

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:20.869
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Who... Who gave you my name?

01:07:22.302 --> 01:07:23.871
Who... Who told you to come here?

01:07:24.103 --> 01:07:25.770
I'm sorry. It's just a mistake, okay?

01:07:25.772 --> 01:07:27.508
Of course it was a mistake.

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.612
Who told you?

01:07:32.447 --> 01:07:34.645
Uh...

01:07:34.647 --> 01:07:36.482
This guy I know, D. Cash. He just...
He said that you were there when...

01:07:36.484 --> 01:07:39.219
D. Cash? D. Cash gave you my name?

01:07:40.788 --> 01:07:42.286
Yeah.

01:07:42.288 --> 01:07:43.521
Okay.

01:07:43.523 --> 01:07:44.655
Okay.

01:07:44.657 --> 01:07:46.458
Uh...

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.626
Okay. Well, you... You... You tell D. Cash

01:07:48.628 --> 01:07:51.199
that he probably shouldn't
be running his mouth.

01:07:52.732 --> 01:07:54.599
- You got it?
- Okay.

01:07:54.601 --> 01:07:57.570
I'm gonna just go now. Okay?

01:07:57.572 --> 01:07:58.737
Whoa, what... What is that?

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:00.675
What is that light?

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:04.746
Are you... are you filming this?

01:08:07.848 --> 01:08:10.351
My man. Are we making a movie?

01:08:11.918 --> 01:08:15.190
Well, I... I guess I'm
ready for my close-up.

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:18.357
Look, man.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:19.759
If you don't know anything,
it's fine. I can just leave.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.629
Do you think I will not use this?

01:08:25.398 --> 01:08:26.401
Bang!

01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:29.870
That was pretty good, huh?

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:37.309
You don't even know who
that dealer was, do you?

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:39.947
The one your boy Kevin pissed off.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.919
That was D., you idiot.

01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:50.258
Oh, he played you.

01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:54.493
See, now I'm in a spot.

01:08:54.495 --> 01:08:56.528
Uh, you know, I... I...

01:08:56.529 --> 01:09:00.267
I did that ungrateful asshole a favor.

01:09:03.537 --> 01:09:05.807
And this is the thanks I get?

01:09:10.343 --> 01:09:13.279
Well, fuck the both of you.

01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:26.685
<i>Why is that? Well, question
seven on the application asks you</i>

01:10:26.687 --> 01:10:28.820
<i>to tell them what your best
and worst qualities are,</i>

01:10:28.822 --> 01:10:31.590
<i>but they only give you
three-and-a-half inches.</i>

01:10:31.592 --> 01:10:33.160
<i>Three-and-a-half
inches on a page.</i>

01:10:33.392 --> 01:10:35.627
<i>I'm sorry, but my worst
qualities took up a lot more</i>

01:10:35.629 --> 01:10:37.061
<i>than three-and-a-half
inches.</i>

01:10:37.063 --> 01:10:38.796
<i>So I decided to write
a few extra pages.</i>

01:10:38.798 --> 01:10:40.565
<i>How many?</i>

01:10:40.567 --> 01:10:42.734
<i>- Twenty-two to be exact.
- Wow!</i>

01:10:42.736 --> 01:10:44.103
<i>- I realize that might seem a bit excessive.
- It does.</i>

01:10:44.105 --> 01:10:45.703
<i>However,
how are you expected</i>

01:10:45.705 --> 01:10:47.905
<i>to express the very
essence of your being</i>

01:10:47.907 --> 01:10:50.810
<i>and your views on how
insanely crazy this world is</i>

01:10:50.812 --> 01:10:52.052
<i>in such a tiny space on a page?</i>

01:11:02.623 --> 01:11:04.088
He's fine.

01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:07.726
- He's very drowsy, but he's stable.
- Okay.

01:11:07.728 --> 01:11:09.048
Yeah, he's going to be all right.

01:11:11.632 --> 01:11:12.730
Well...

01:11:12.732 --> 01:11:15.069
Hi. Sorry. He's asking for Phoebe.

01:11:19.606 --> 01:11:20.608
Okay.

01:11:25.945 --> 01:11:28.412
Hmm.

01:11:28.414 --> 01:11:30.082
You want some coffee or something?

01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:31.552
Coffee? No.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:39.960
Phoebe's here.

01:11:44.498 --> 01:11:45.767
Thank you.

01:11:51.806 --> 01:11:52.839
Hi.

01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:54.575
Hi.

01:12:01.147 --> 01:12:03.150
You smell nice.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.821
Did they find Lorriner?

01:12:09.589 --> 01:12:11.657
Yeah.

01:12:11.659 --> 01:12:14.562
They caught him. Somewhere in Virginia.

01:12:16.963 --> 01:12:19.732
He still had the gun on him, Addy.

01:12:19.734 --> 01:12:22.136
They think it's the same
gun he used to kill Kevin.

01:12:24.538 --> 01:12:26.941
And they got D. Cash and Noel, too.

01:12:31.812 --> 01:12:33.147
The Broaduses know.

01:12:35.615 --> 01:12:37.017
They know who killed their son.

01:12:38.651 --> 01:12:40.685
You talked to them?

01:12:40.687 --> 01:12:43.087
Yeah, they came by.

01:12:43.089 --> 01:12:45.025
They left that letter for you.

01:12:48.062 --> 01:12:50.097
I'm still so mad at you.

01:12:51.499 --> 01:12:52.600
I know.

01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:56.771
I should thank you.

01:12:57.972 --> 01:12:59.703
Why?

01:12:59.705 --> 01:13:02.776
Because if it weren't for
you, I'd probably be dead.

01:13:05.612 --> 01:13:08.947
Really? Because I totally
thought you had it covered.
