00:11.053 --> 00:12.447
Your true purpose beckons you.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.682
But you hesitate.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.726
- Why?
- Because I'm weak.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.728
- Why are you weak?
- Because I'm impure.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.105
- How do you purge yourself?
- Through prayer.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.816
Kneel.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.194
Pray that your heart

00:27.236 --> 00:28.612
will be cleansed of all doubt.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.240
Your mind made certain
of your mission.

00:34.744 --> 00:36.704
For these

00:36.746 --> 00:39.248
are the moments
around which history pivots.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.668
Sanctify me in your holy name.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.842
Purify me in your holy fire.

00:54.638 --> 00:57.933
Strengthen me
in your holy breath.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.352
Good.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.772
Now strip him.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

02:20.808 --> 02:22.560
Help! Someone help!

02:22.601 --> 02:26.313
- Quickly.
- Oh... Oh, my God.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.108
What the fuck?

02:29.149 --> 02:32.695
She was on about that bloke
as was took away last night.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.947
And you, what? You helped her
tie the fucking noose?

02:34.989 --> 02:36.949
I didn't think
she'd do anything like this.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.492
Eh?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.787
Well, this is a right cock-up.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.998
- That it is, sir...
- Oh, sh...

02:47.877 --> 02:49.378
Go on, Vig!

02:50.754 --> 02:52.923
- Get her! Get her!
- Let me go!

02:52.965 --> 02:54.383
Come on.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.011
Philo!

03:06.645 --> 03:10.524
Philo is fucking dead, you twat.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.911
What are you waiting for?

03:23.495 --> 03:26.498
I want to look you in the eyes.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.960
What do you think
you're gonna see?

03:30.002 --> 03:32.212
A darkness.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.632
An emptiness.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.718
Some sign of your true nature.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.138
My true nature? I've got very
good at hiding my true nature

03:41.180 --> 03:43.390
thanks to you, you fuck.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.479
No sign of remorse whatsoever.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.482
Remorse?

03:51.523 --> 03:52.942
For what?

03:55.945 --> 03:57.780
Don't you dare.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.867
You tore her apart.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.036
Gutted her like a fish!

04:04.078 --> 04:05.621
Your own mother!

04:05.663 --> 04:09.625
You think I killed
Aisling Quarelle?

04:09.667 --> 04:12.252
Say her name again.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.963
Go on.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.339
I dare you. Say it.

04:16.382 --> 04:19.551
She didn't deserve
to die like that.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.304
In such a terrible way.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.306
No.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.810
She didn't.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.020
Put the gun down.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.023
Beg.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.192
Beg me for your life.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.860
Go on.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.154
The way she begged you
for hers. Beg!

04:39.196 --> 04:42.241
It wasn't me she was begging.
Put the gun down.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.326
Oh, fuck this.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.874
- Piece of ancient shit...
- I wouldn't do that.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.971
I didn't kill my mother.

05:04.013 --> 05:07.266
I didn't even know who she was.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.268
The first time I saw her,

05:09.309 --> 05:14.106
she was lying in a pool
of her own blood, murdered.

05:14.148 --> 05:20.070
By you, I thought, till now.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.032
She left me at a foundling home.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.951
I grew up with nothing
but questions.

05:25.993 --> 05:30.456
And I'm never gonna be able
to ask them of her now, am I?

05:32.541 --> 05:34.918
But I can ask you.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.713
Me?

05:37.755 --> 05:41.216
You, Father.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.221
I was a college student

05:46.263 --> 05:51.351
when I first saw her at some
late night salon on the Row.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.604
Her performance made
an impression on me,

05:53.645 --> 05:57.691
and I was just drunk enough
to say so.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.110
Much to the amusement
of some elites

06:00.152 --> 06:02.279
who had been flirting with her.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.323
Here was some farm boy
from the Hinterlands

06:04.364 --> 06:07.868
fawning over
the queen of the Row.

06:07.910 --> 06:12.289
But she didn't permit me
the embarrassment.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.708
She sent them away.

06:20.422 --> 06:25.803
She was something
of a pastoral girl herself,

06:25.844 --> 06:29.556
homesick for the mountains
of Anoun.

06:31.558 --> 06:36.396
When winter came,
I brought her here.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.274
To my family's summer house.

06:42.444 --> 06:48.117
They were the strangest and most
uncomplicated days of my life.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.707
I thought they'd never end.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.422
But then my father
discovered our secret.

07:04.341 --> 07:08.637
So it wasn't you
she was afraid of.

07:08.679 --> 07:12.015
- It was him.
- My father wasn't

07:12.057 --> 07:14.601
a conventionally powerful man,

07:14.643 --> 07:19.606
but he was brutal,
with brutal friends.

07:23.652 --> 07:27.865
He threatened to kill her
unless I called it off.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.327
That was the last time
you saw her?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.955
She asked to see me
one more time.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.417
I... never showed up.

07:40.002 --> 07:44.047
Just left her there in the club
where we first met.

07:44.089 --> 07:48.218
I never knew what it was
she needed to tell me,

07:48.260 --> 07:50.220
until now.

07:50.262 --> 07:55.100
It's clear to me
it was about you.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.520
I was a coward.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.732
My father was right.

08:01.773 --> 08:06.820
I never would've gotten where I
am had I stayed with her, but...

08:06.862 --> 08:10.782
something inside me
died that day.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.746
I wouldn't be surprised
if you despise me.

08:20.584 --> 08:24.171
I want to hate you,

08:24.213 --> 08:28.383
but it's a familiar story.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.385
Too familiar, maybe.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.846
Mine starts in Tirnanoc.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.861
I trust your guest found
her way home this morning, sir?

08:47.903 --> 08:49.529
She did.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.326
And do you imagine
you'll be seeing her again?

08:54.368 --> 08:57.913
I fail to see
what concern it is of yours.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.957
Quiet right, sir.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.170
No, no. Tell me, Fergus.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.882
I beg your pardon, sir?

09:10.842 --> 09:13.011
Do you disapprove
of my behavior?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.891
Does the thought of it
repulse you?

09:17.933 --> 09:20.143
You answer me, Fergus!

09:25.774 --> 09:28.443
What concern is that of yours?

09:28.485 --> 09:34.032
Sir, surely you know
if anyone were to find out...

09:34.074 --> 09:37.828
And how exactly
would they find out, Fergus?

09:37.869 --> 09:40.998
Are you saying I can no longer
rely on your discretion?

09:41.039 --> 09:42.833
I'm only saying this affair

09:42.874 --> 09:45.294
is not as well-hidden
as you imagine.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.922
- People are already talking.
- Talking.

09:48.964 --> 09:52.342
- That's all they do, isn't it?
- It's not all they can do, sir.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.594
It's dangerous,
what you're doing.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.806
I'm well-acquainted
with danger, Fergus.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.226
Is she?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.862
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.281
- Are you going somewhere?
- Something's come up.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.199
I-I tried
to tell you last night.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.994
- I knocked on your door at half past seven.
- Oh.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.371
I must've fallen asleep.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.082
Are you coming down
with something, dear?

10:24.124 --> 10:27.502
It must've been the book
I was reading. Uh...

10:27.544 --> 10:28.712
Where are you going?

10:28.754 --> 10:30.380
The Swan is ready.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.591
- Swan?
- Where's my tobacco?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.218
This new ship of yours?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.220
We take its maiden voyage today.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.139
We'll head up the coast
to Port Hoy

10:39.181 --> 10:40.849
and then come directly back.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.560
Is Mr. Agreus to accompany you?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.647
Wouldn't that be a lark, dear?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.900
We should invite him to dinner
when you come back.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.569
Hmm? Another scheme?

10:52.611 --> 10:54.237
No. To celebrate, as friends.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.490
Friends?

10:56.531 --> 11:00.619
Well, business partners,
at least.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.497
Come now, Imogen.

11:03.538 --> 11:07.084
- What?
- Parties,

11:07.125 --> 11:10.379
private dinners, auctions?

11:10.420 --> 11:13.256
I'm quite sure I don't know
what you're insinuating.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.092
It's just that people
would start

11:15.133 --> 11:17.928
to make unflattering assumptions
if you continue on this course.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.930
Who gives a damn
what people think?

11:19.971 --> 11:21.640
Imogen!

11:21.681 --> 11:23.892
It's just exhausting,

11:23.934 --> 11:27.312
constantly worrying about
what people might think.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.149
It's no way to live, Ezra.

11:31.191 --> 11:36.571
You speak as though
this, uh, creature

11:36.613 --> 11:38.824
has truly become
a friend to you?

11:38.865 --> 11:42.327
- No, of course not.
- So?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.538
Well, what is he, then?

11:44.579 --> 11:47.040
A neighbor.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.544
- Yes?
- An acquaintance.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.714
A Puck.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.304
I'll see that
she's released, but...

12:01.346 --> 12:04.933
you can't return to the city.
You understand that?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.768
The killer's still out there.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.355
Which you are in no position
to investigate.

12:10.397 --> 12:15.068
From what you've told me,
you're the next target.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.904
I can't just stand by.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.866
As far as anyone knows,
you were taken to be executed.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.868
Stay dead.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.870
You'll live longer.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.038
I'll see this ugliness settled.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.875
Turn your eye to the chances
you have left

12:29.916 --> 12:32.169
with that girl of yours.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.797
Before it's too late.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.133
Trust me on this.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.599
Vignette...?

12:45.640 --> 12:47.601
- Stonemoss.
- Vignette Stonemoss.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.479
I'll take care of it.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.651
I wish I knew you better.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.450
Godspeed, my boy.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.229
Was it that Longerbane girl?

13:38.610 --> 13:42.447
Did you really think your driver
would keep that secret?

13:44.783 --> 13:46.868
Fine. Yes.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.745
I was with Sophie.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.789
Sophie Longerbane.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.628
Well, I'd advise you
to stay away from her.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.047
I would think you'd be relieved
I wasn't on the Row.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.966
That girl...

14:01.007 --> 14:03.134
is twice as dangerous
as anything on the Row.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.971
You don't know
that family like I do.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.473
I knew her father
before you were even born.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.100
And he was a snake.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.851
- He's never wronged me.
- How can you

14:11.893 --> 14:14.396
even say that
after he kidnapped you?

14:14.437 --> 14:17.816
Do you take me
for a fucking fool?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.821
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
It was for your own good.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.198
- It's always been for your own good.
- As if you have

14:25.240 --> 14:27.826
- any idea what my own good was.
- You don't see the big picture

14:27.867 --> 14:29.953
- from where you're standing.
- Then show it to me.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.329
Jonah, y-you have to trust me.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.748
No, if you have some reason
for me to reconsider my choices,

14:33.790 --> 14:35.500
you can explain it
to me like an adult.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.835
She's leader of the opposition.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.396
- I'll see whom I please.
- No, not her.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.838
Why the fuck not?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.190
- Because...
- Oh, because, because what?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.067
- Because she's smarter than you? Hmm?
- No, not her.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.944
- Because she's more beautiful?
- Because... Not her, not her...

14:44.968 --> 14:46.219
Because she's younger than you?

14:46.261 --> 14:48.013
Because she's your sister.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.714
Shut that bloody dog up.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.795
I know who you are.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.968
Fight the false
imprisonment of fae.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.137
Thank you very much.
Help out Vignette.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.514
Come on, ladies.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.349
- Moira?
- Take it.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.142
Thank you.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.560
I'll-I'll pay you back.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.937
Don't worry about it.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.438
We look after our own, eh?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.148
Hello, Patrick.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.859
Thank you, you're a gentleman.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.950
What do you want, Philo?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.077
I'm just here for Vignette.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.162
Well, as far as I'm aware,

16:36.204 --> 16:38.415
her current address
is a holding cell

16:38.456 --> 16:41.292
under constabulary number six.
At least until this fucking

16:41.334 --> 16:43.336
- bribe is paid.
- You don't have to worry

16:43.378 --> 16:45.964
about that.
She's being released.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.676
What d'you mean,
she's being released?

16:51.720 --> 16:54.139
I wish to see the Magister
of Police at once.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.391
What may I say of the reason?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.476
You may say it is urgent.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.148
Pour me a cup of tea, will you?

17:03.189 --> 17:05.483
Um...

17:05.525 --> 17:07.109
Krik.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.656
A new world is upon us, Krik.
Change is coming

17:12.699 --> 17:14.451
to this city.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.412
Ah. It starts now,

17:17.454 --> 17:21.165
with the one thing
my father could not give me.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.292
Freedom.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.502
Vignette...

17:25.545 --> 17:27.797
Stonemoss.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.054
Your tea.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.855
You're not Krik.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.501
Death to the tyrant!

18:04.542 --> 18:06.294
The Hidden One is revealed.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.712
- Death to the tyrant!
- Oi!

18:07.754 --> 18:09.130
He has revealed!

18:09.172 --> 18:12.175
Death to the tyrant!
He has revealed!

18:22.644 --> 18:25.230
He's-he's still breathing.
He's alive.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.161
You're growing rather bold,

18:40.203 --> 18:43.873
showing up at my house like
this, in broad daylight no less.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.083
I won't be long.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.001
Come now, don't be
so pessimistic.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.753
We can't, Sophie.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.922
We can't what?

18:50.964 --> 18:52.507
We can't keep doing this.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.221
Ah.

18:58.263 --> 19:01.349
I see what this is.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.143
Your mother told you, did she?

19:04.185 --> 19:07.230
Told me what?

19:07.272 --> 19:10.692
About her affair with my father.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.532
- You knew?
- Calm down, Jonah.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.951
- You knew we were...
- I knew it was a possibility.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.679
What, and-and the possibility
alone didn't...

19:21.703 --> 19:23.079
Didn't what?

19:23.121 --> 19:25.790
Oh, I don't know,
give you some pause?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.212
Why should it?

19:31.254 --> 19:35.717
I grew up alone,
locked up in this place.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.637
No friends, no siblings,
no family,

19:39.679 --> 19:42.390
apart from a distant,

19:42.432 --> 19:44.809
bitter father.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.645
And then a stranger
comes into my life,

19:47.687 --> 19:51.149
with whom I feel some shred
of a connection.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.777
Why should that give me
any pause at all?

19:57.864 --> 20:00.992
Because the world out there
has boundaries.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.994
Well, since when
have you ever cared

20:03.036 --> 20:05.038
about that world's boundaries?

20:07.040 --> 20:10.043
We don't belong to that world.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.086
It belongs to us.

20:14.631 --> 20:18.009
We are descended from emperors

20:18.051 --> 20:20.386
and pharaohs.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.472
You really think
this is the first time

20:22.513 --> 20:25.266
this has happened
in our family tree?

20:25.308 --> 20:30.146
This is how power was born.

20:34.192 --> 20:37.070
You could be a force
to be reckoned with.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.379
- What's this?
- An offer.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.214
Something to consider.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.132
Come in.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.301
What is it, Jenila?

21:00.343 --> 21:01.928
A messenger from Balefire.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.972
Master Jonah
is to return at once.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.691
Where is that Critch traitor?

21:14.732 --> 21:16.651
He's being interrogated
at the Keep.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.333
We're questioning
all the Critch servants,

21:18.361 --> 21:19.797
and we'll be replacing them,
of course.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.114
How is he?

21:21.155 --> 21:23.366
- He's stable for now.
- I need to see him.

21:23.408 --> 21:27.286
No. He's-he's weak.
He needs to rest.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.872
Jonah, don't...

21:29.914 --> 21:32.083
Don't upset him.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.008
Jonah.

21:49.767 --> 21:53.855
They say I'm likely to survive.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.649
That was a close call.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.693
Indeed.

21:59.736 --> 22:03.656
Tell me...
did it cross your mind

22:03.698 --> 22:06.868
how ill-equipped I was to assume
your responsibilities

22:06.909 --> 22:08.411
if you hadn't.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.246
Hadn't what?

22:10.288 --> 22:12.248
Survived.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.917
But I'm likely to.
They-they say that I'm likely...

22:14.959 --> 22:16.294
I keep thinking how...

22:16.335 --> 22:19.547
odd it is that you
never remedied that,

22:19.589 --> 22:21.966
with so much at stake.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.302
That you'd always let me
get away with anything.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.305
If I was too soft, it's because
I have such love for you.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.557
But no ambitions, no plans.

22:29.599 --> 22:34.312
It's as if you never saw me
as a true successor.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.232
That's preposterous.
You carry my very name.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.777
Your name and little else.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.071
Where is this coming from?

22:43.112 --> 22:45.239
Mother told me the truth.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.657
Jonah.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.245
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.706
You expect me to believe that?

22:53.748 --> 22:57.376
As much as you...
hated Ritter Longerbane?

22:57.418 --> 23:00.004
You knew something.
You've at least suspected.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.965
- Suspected?
- Really?

23:03.007 --> 23:07.845
In-in-in quiet moments,
in the dead of night,

23:07.887 --> 23:11.349
you never scrutinized

23:11.390 --> 23:13.017
my sleeping face and wondered...

23:13.059 --> 23:16.854
Wondered if you were
really my son.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.066
There it is.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.946
There it is.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.865
Early on.

23:27.907 --> 23:32.495
Longerbane was a rival
for her affections, after all.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.580
But, Jonah,

23:34.622 --> 23:37.708
you are my boy.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.752
My boy.

23:39.794 --> 23:42.171
And I'm proud
that you have my name.

23:42.213 --> 23:44.757
Couldn't give a fuck
about your name...

23:44.799 --> 23:47.593
or her ridiculous
prophecy, frankly.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.887
Jonah, where are you going?

23:49.929 --> 23:52.473
Jonah, come back.

23:52.515 --> 23:55.017
- Jonah.
- Goodbye, Chancellor.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.436
Jonah!

24:01.899 --> 24:04.277
Why?

24:06.904 --> 24:08.698
So...

24:08.739 --> 24:11.826
you're Breakspear's

24:11.868 --> 24:13.870
bastard son?

24:13.911 --> 24:16.080
So it would seem.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.418
And Vini knew your secret,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.420
that you were a-a half-blood

24:22.461 --> 24:24.463
all this time?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.216
Since Tirnanoc.

24:29.260 --> 24:32.263
That explains so much.

24:37.894 --> 24:40.563
Just, um...

24:40.605 --> 24:42.815
just take care of her.

24:44.859 --> 24:47.403
Please.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.447
I will.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.825
Not that she needs me
the way I need her.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.286
Oh, she does.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.998
Open that drawer.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.338
Go on.

25:16.265 --> 25:20.561
She brought it
all the way from Anoun.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.147
It was all she brought.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.733
I told her to burn it
and have done with you,

25:25.775 --> 25:27.526
but she wouldn't.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.239
- Should've known then, really.
- Known what?

25:33.282 --> 25:36.118
That she still loved you,
you idiot.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.004
Oh, hello.

26:29.422 --> 26:33.217
This is the servants' entrance,
Miss Imogen.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.178
Yes, I'm aware of the irony.
Very amusing.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.268
Well, aren't you going
to invite me in?

26:52.153 --> 26:54.613
What are you doing here?

26:54.655 --> 26:56.866
I thought we might...

26:58.743 --> 27:01.746
You thought we might... what?

27:01.787 --> 27:06.542
Well... you know.

27:06.584 --> 27:09.837
I'm sure I don't.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.923
You're being very difficult.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.552
Well, you came to my house.
I'm merely asking why.

27:16.594 --> 27:21.015
Don't you think we have some...

27:21.057 --> 27:22.099
matters to discuss?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.559
It's early.

27:23.601 --> 27:26.604
Won't your brother be wondering
where you are?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.731
He's left town for the night.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.276
What?

27:32.318 --> 27:33.903
You shouldn't be here.

27:33.944 --> 27:37.281
You can't just expect me
to pretend it never happened.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.201
That's exactly what I expect.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.995
And you?
Can you forget so easily?

27:44.372 --> 27:46.248
Don't flatter yourself.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.292
I beg your pardon.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.670
It would be improper for me
to say more.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.589
Well, don't hold back
on my account.

27:53.631 --> 27:54.840
We're both adults.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.051
Very well. You want the truth?

27:57.093 --> 27:58.719
I think I deserve it.

27:58.761 --> 28:02.723
The truth, Miss Imogen,

28:02.765 --> 28:04.975
is that you are a callow

28:05.017 --> 28:06.685
and graceless lover,

28:06.727 --> 28:10.189
and yesterday was
utterly forgettable.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.777
You're lying.

28:14.819 --> 28:17.405
What do you know?

28:17.446 --> 28:20.741
I know enough.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.744
I know there are things
a man can't fake.

28:23.786 --> 28:26.622
What do you want me to say?

28:29.125 --> 28:31.502
That it obsesses me?

28:31.544 --> 28:34.380
The smell of your hair, the feel
of your skin against mine.

28:34.422 --> 28:38.342
That I haven't stopped thinking
about it all day?

28:40.928 --> 28:44.682
But you wish to, is that it?

28:49.061 --> 28:53.190
There are some pursuits
even I can't afford.

28:59.530 --> 29:02.700
Then why even bother with this
whole ridiculous charade?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.202
Charade?

29:05.244 --> 29:07.955
The house. The clothes. The art.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.374
What is the point in
pretending to be one of us

29:10.416 --> 29:13.127
if there is any part of this
life you cannot have?

29:13.169 --> 29:15.588
Oh, yes, that's it, isn't it?

29:15.629 --> 29:19.592
That's how your kind goes
through life, isn't it?

29:19.633 --> 29:21.343
Perfectly entitled.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.887
Thinking everyone wants
to be you,

29:22.928 --> 29:24.889
and the whole bloody world
belongs to you.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.783
Well, if you mean we don't
apologize for our ambitions,

29:26.807 --> 29:27.892
then you're right.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.293
When we want something,
we take it.

29:33.647 --> 29:36.775
And what is it that you want?

29:36.817 --> 29:40.488
You know good and well
what I want.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.156
Get dressed.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.998
- Ezra.
- Go home and wait for me.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.959
This is between myself
and Mr. Agreus.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.718
Get out of the bed.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.720
Out.

31:37.855 --> 31:38.897
Ezra...

31:42.401 --> 31:45.321
Ezra, please.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.739
Get away!

31:48.240 --> 31:51.118
You, turn and face the wall.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.333
Turn around and face the wall,
you animal.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.552
You whore! You whore.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.804
How dare you consort
with a fucking animal!

32:10.846 --> 32:12.765
You'll destroy us!

32:30.783 --> 32:32.326
Now you've done it.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.620
All of this,

32:34.662 --> 32:38.624
everything you have
is going to go.

32:38.666 --> 32:41.585
You're dead, Puck.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.212
You're as good as dead.

32:48.050 --> 32:50.636
- Imogen, what are you doing?
- Agreus, we have to go.

32:50.678 --> 32:52.364
- We have to leave now.
- But this is my house.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.890
I know, but the police will not
see it that way.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.409
They will come
and they will see a Puck

32:56.433 --> 32:58.227
standing over a bleeding man.
Please.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.228
Are you insane?

32:59.269 --> 33:01.689
Where-where will you go?

33:01.730 --> 33:04.817
I-Imogen, you-you can't leave.
Im-Imogen!

33:04.858 --> 33:08.821
Open the door.
Open the door!

33:08.862 --> 33:11.740
Wherever you will go,
I-I will find you both!

33:11.782 --> 33:13.158
I will find you!

33:15.828 --> 33:17.913
Something's not right.

33:21.834 --> 33:25.129
Well, surely he wouldn't have
forgotten, would he?

33:26.171 --> 33:28.590
Moira!

33:28.632 --> 33:30.217
She's dead.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.218
Who?

33:31.260 --> 33:32.344
The Haruspex.

33:32.386 --> 33:35.180
The Haruspex?

33:35.222 --> 33:36.849
Fleury, did you say
the Haruspex?

33:36.890 --> 33:38.892
What do you mean?

33:41.687 --> 33:43.397
Coming through.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.842
Was it the Darkasher?

34:11.884 --> 34:14.928
Why her?

34:14.969 --> 34:16.929
She knew something.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.226
Or she saw something.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.067
It didn't take her liver,
though.

34:33.572 --> 34:37.409
Inspector...

34:37.451 --> 34:41.455
I've been waiting for you.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.349
The press have
got wind of the incident.

34:43.373 --> 34:46.335
They're starting
to ask questions.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.668
Anything else?

34:47.710 --> 34:50.005
You were holding this
when you were attacked.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.799
Thank you.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.717
Has the magister of police
arrived yet?

34:53.759 --> 34:55.469
He's still on his way.

34:55.511 --> 34:58.555
Damn it. Hurry him up.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.310
You sent for me?

35:05.062 --> 35:06.688
I did.

35:06.730 --> 35:10.108
Darling... is there anything
I can get for you?

35:10.150 --> 35:13.195
- No.
- I hate to see you like this.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.155
Some water.

35:20.244 --> 35:22.746
I just wanted to tell you that

35:22.788 --> 35:25.791
I spoke to Jonah earlier.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.547
Oh? How did that go?

35:31.588 --> 35:34.925
He may have inadvertently
helped me solve a little riddle

35:34.967 --> 35:37.344
that I've been
mulling over lately.

35:37.386 --> 35:39.513
Oh.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.433
What sort of riddle?

35:43.475 --> 35:45.561
Is she still alive?

35:45.602 --> 35:48.397
I am...

35:48.438 --> 35:51.108
suspended in the gloaming,

35:51.149 --> 35:54.069
between day and night...

35:55.654 --> 36:00.075
...between the breath
and the silence,

36:00.117 --> 36:04.079
with the warp and weft
of creation

36:04.121 --> 36:07.165
unfurled before me.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.588
I can see it all so clearly now.

36:12.629 --> 36:16.550
Every thread.

36:16.592 --> 36:20.095
Every intersection.

36:20.137 --> 36:24.850
What if my dear wife

36:24.892 --> 36:29.521
always harbored
some private reason

36:29.563 --> 36:33.275
to doubt that her boy
was my son?

36:33.317 --> 36:34.526
You're delirious.

36:34.568 --> 36:39.072
But it was my son who was
augured for greatness.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.533
And I had no other.

36:41.575 --> 36:45.913
Until, by some means
known only to her,

36:45.954 --> 36:47.873
she discovered a secret.

36:47.915 --> 36:48.874
I'm getting the doctor.

36:48.916 --> 36:52.085
A secret that
even I didn't know.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.047
There was,
somewhere in the world,

36:55.088 --> 36:57.674
another son.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.386
Who did this?

37:01.428 --> 37:05.265
Should have seen it sooner.

37:05.307 --> 37:09.186
It was right in front of me
all along.

37:09.227 --> 37:13.398
The interest she took
in my work.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.360
Now she had a problem.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.070
She had no way of knowing

37:18.111 --> 37:20.989
if the future
promised to her child,

37:21.031 --> 37:24.660
the future she'd gambled
everything on,

37:24.701 --> 37:27.162
belonged, in fact, to another.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.206
But she knew at least

37:29.247 --> 37:32.334
that it couldn't belong
to a dead man.

37:32.376 --> 37:36.588
She was always
such a curious girl.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.424
Too curious.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.677
Who? Who was?

37:43.804 --> 37:46.556
The chancellor's wife.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.351
Where is he?

37:49.393 --> 37:51.269
I've met him, Piety.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.271
Where?

37:53.313 --> 37:55.482
He can never amount to anything.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.985
Not here.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.695
He's a half-blood.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.697
- He's no threat to our...
- Where is he?

38:01.738 --> 38:04.449
Jonah is the one.
He is my son.

38:04.491 --> 38:08.412
The future you've been promised
belongs to him. Only him.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.932
- I can't take that chance. Tell me where he is.
- Piety, Piety,

38:10.956 --> 38:13.583
no one need know any of this.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.585
But this must stop now.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.170
No. Tell me.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.089
God's noose, Piety!

38:19.131 --> 38:21.049
It's just a circus trick!

38:21.091 --> 38:23.010
Pay any pig charlatan 50 stivers

38:23.051 --> 38:24.779
and they'll tell you anything
you want to hear!

38:24.803 --> 38:26.513
- Tell me, tell me.
- It's not real.

38:26.555 --> 38:28.306
- You have to tell me.
- It's not real!

38:28.348 --> 38:31.018
It never was, Piety!

38:31.059 --> 38:34.062
Tell me. Tell me.

38:34.104 --> 38:37.566
Tell me! Tell me!

38:37.607 --> 38:40.193
Tell me!

38:40.235 --> 38:43.822
You will, one way or another.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.126
I sense her, even now.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.586
Her rage...

38:57.627 --> 39:00.922
is a bruise on time itself.

39:00.964 --> 39:04.259
Makes her strong, makes her...

39:04.301 --> 39:06.553
powerful.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.517
Her dark work is not yet done.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.519
Not yet.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.859
More blood has been shed.

39:20.901 --> 39:23.612
Your father's blood.

39:53.225 --> 39:57.187
His secrets are hers now.

39:57.229 --> 40:00.357
Like father, like son.

40:01.817 --> 40:06.363
She knows your weakness.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.116
A girl.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.159
A Pix.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.372
The one you love

40:15.413 --> 40:18.542
is in grave danger.

40:34.349 --> 40:38.436
"Vignette Stonemoss."

40:43.650 --> 40:45.443
You've got
friends in high places,

40:45.485 --> 40:48.446
don't you?

40:48.488 --> 40:51.700
They even sent a coach
to pick you up.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.288
She's hers now.

40:56.329 --> 40:59.416
Time is running out. Go.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.961
Go, go.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.760
How are you
going to get into Balefire?

41:10.802 --> 41:13.471
Same way that thing gets out.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.855
Right, then. I'll find her.

41:21.897 --> 41:24.107
I'll see you soon.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.147
It's something to consider.

42:23.875 --> 42:28.004
Lady Piety was the last person
to see him alive.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.174
- Where is she?
- No one has seen her since.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.593
- Find her.
- Magister,

42:33.635 --> 42:35.905
you can't seriously think she
had something to do with this?

42:35.929 --> 42:37.931
He was alive when
she was in the room.

42:37.973 --> 42:39.933
Now he's dead, and she's gone.

42:39.975 --> 42:41.786
Clearly the Puck
attacker had coconspirators...

42:41.810 --> 42:43.395
Find her!

42:43.436 --> 42:46.273
Yes, Chancellor.

42:48.942 --> 42:50.735
"Chancellor..."

42:50.777 --> 42:52.570
It's true.

42:52.612 --> 42:55.740
Until the next election,
you are acting chancellor.

43:07.627 --> 43:10.588
I'm not a violent person.

43:10.630 --> 43:14.467
I don't want to do this.

43:16.344 --> 43:19.139
But I will if you force me to.

43:19.180 --> 43:21.891
You don't want
to do what, exactly?

43:21.933 --> 43:24.728
Just tell me
where your friend is,

43:24.769 --> 43:27.063
and you'll never have to know.

44:12.275 --> 44:14.235
It's you?

44:14.277 --> 44:16.946
- You made the Darkasher?
- Shut up.

44:16.988 --> 44:18.782
I'm the one asking
the questions.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.408
Where is he?

44:20.450 --> 44:22.994
What do you want with him?

44:23.036 --> 44:26.623
Fuck. Are you not
hearing me at all?

44:26.664 --> 44:29.584
Do you understand
what's at stake here?

44:29.626 --> 44:34.005
Do you have any idea
what I've done?

44:46.851 --> 44:50.939
I-I, I don't know where he is.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.359
Would you tell me if you did?

44:54.401 --> 44:56.361
Mm, no.

44:56.403 --> 44:58.655
I didn't think so.

45:03.910 --> 45:07.956
And I gave you every chance
in the world to save yourself.

45:07.997 --> 45:10.750
You should have just told me.

45:26.599 --> 45:30.145
I think we're in luck.

45:30.186 --> 45:33.356
He's coming for you.

46:40.965 --> 46:43.593
All right.

47:45.071 --> 47:48.908
I should have known
you'd come for her.

47:48.950 --> 47:51.744
- What have you done with her?
- She's fine.

47:51.786 --> 47:54.163
It's not about her.

47:54.205 --> 47:57.375
It was never about any of them.

47:57.417 --> 48:00.003
It was only about you.

48:00.044 --> 48:02.046
It's always been about you.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.302
You know, the irony is that
I would never have even known

48:07.343 --> 48:10.388
you existed if not for your
mother's blackmail note.

48:10.430 --> 48:12.015
Blackmail note?

48:12.056 --> 48:14.934
The lengths a mother
goes to, eh?

48:17.353 --> 48:18.521
I can't take any chances.

48:18.563 --> 48:21.107
Not after all I sacrificed.

48:21.149 --> 48:25.236
I've come too far
to turn back now.

48:25.278 --> 48:29.240
The time has come
to finish this.

48:29.282 --> 48:31.659
It's finished.

48:33.703 --> 48:35.747
Oh, but it's not.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.562
He wasn't alone.

50:22.603 --> 50:24.522
There are others.

50:24.564 --> 50:27.984
The Puck will give us names.
It's only a matter of time.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.236
I want emergency measures
in place today.

50:30.278 --> 50:31.696
Am I perfectly clear?

50:31.738 --> 50:35.074
Now, unless
there is anything else,

50:35.116 --> 50:37.869
I have a parliamentary address
to prepare for.

50:39.412 --> 50:41.456
Oh, Mr. Millworthy,
there you are.

50:41.497 --> 50:43.332
You sent for me, sir?

50:43.374 --> 50:47.545
- I did indeed.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

50:47.587 --> 50:49.714
It's a horrid ordeal.

50:49.756 --> 50:52.925
Has your mother
been located yet?

50:52.967 --> 50:56.763
No. No, she remains
unaccounted for.

50:56.804 --> 50:59.724
- Ah.
- Uh, but th-this was found

50:59.766 --> 51:01.434
among her personal effects.

51:01.476 --> 51:03.436
What is it?

51:03.478 --> 51:05.396
A faerie was found dead
on the Row last week.

51:05.438 --> 51:08.608
A singer of some repute
in her day.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.860
Aisling.

51:10.902 --> 51:15.156
Yes. I'm to understand
you moved in the same circles.

51:15.198 --> 51:18.159
It was a long time ago.

51:18.201 --> 51:20.453
But you did know her?

51:20.495 --> 51:25.792
Forgive me, sir, but why did
you call me here, if I may ask?

51:30.046 --> 51:32.048
Read it.

51:37.386 --> 51:39.388
Out loud, please.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.809
"Dearest Lady Piety,

51:42.850 --> 51:46.145
"forgive me for involving you
in this sad business,

51:46.187 --> 51:49.315
"but you will understand
in a moment why one such as I

51:49.357 --> 51:52.068
"might not trust your husband
to do right.

51:52.109 --> 51:56.489
"The truth is, I have fallen on
hard times since last I saw him.

51:56.531 --> 51:58.699
"But with
election season nearing,

51:58.741 --> 52:01.953
"I am sure the papers
would pay very good money

52:01.994 --> 52:06.624
to hear the story
of the half-blood son..."

52:07.917 --> 52:10.962
"...the story
of the half-blood son

52:11.003 --> 52:15.424
I bore by the chancellor."

52:15.466 --> 52:18.135
- Sir, I think that...
- It would appear

52:18.177 --> 52:20.096
this letter was written
by your faerie friend.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.156
What do you think about that?

52:21.180 --> 52:23.015
No.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.060
It's not her style.

52:27.937 --> 52:31.649
- Are you quite sure?
- Yes.

52:33.234 --> 52:36.153
She was my dear friend.

52:36.195 --> 52:37.673
That's not her voice.
That's not her way.

52:37.697 --> 52:41.284
No, I am certain. Aisling would
never write such a letter.

52:41.325 --> 52:44.495
I was afraid you'd say that.

52:47.582 --> 52:49.083
I've decided that I'm no longer

52:49.125 --> 52:51.961
in need of
an arts and letters tutor.

52:57.717 --> 52:59.594
I understand, sir.

52:59.635 --> 53:01.929
But I am in need
of an honest man.

53:03.556 --> 53:05.641
Sir?

53:10.354 --> 53:12.690
Special advisor
to the chancellor.

53:17.987 --> 53:19.113
Thank you.

53:24.869 --> 53:27.830
You are a steadying influence,
Mr. Millworthy.

53:27.872 --> 53:30.583
I will need that.

53:30.625 --> 53:32.668
In the hard days to come.

53:32.710 --> 53:36.088
Sorry.
What hard days to come?

53:36.130 --> 53:38.257
It turns out that this
Puck assassin was a member

53:38.299 --> 53:39.717
of a larger radical
organization.

53:39.759 --> 53:41.010
What? What do you mean?

53:41.052 --> 53:43.971
And what does that mean
for the city and the Row

53:44.013 --> 53:45.431
and all the innocent fae?

53:45.473 --> 53:48.017
It means that things
are going to get worse

53:48.059 --> 53:49.769
before they get better.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.211
Where is it you're going?

53:58.235 --> 53:59.862
Port Hoy.
Then to New Freehold.

53:59.904 --> 54:02.323
Somewhere a pair like us
won't raise eyebrows.

54:02.365 --> 54:04.825
Well, I wish you luck.

54:04.867 --> 54:07.286
You're not cross with me,
are you?

54:07.328 --> 54:09.413
Why would I be cross with you?

54:09.455 --> 54:11.165
I don't know.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.085
Oh.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.630
Look, Vini... um...

54:17.672 --> 54:20.174
I'm your friend above all.

54:20.216 --> 54:23.135
Always your friend.
I-I just want you to be happy.

54:23.177 --> 54:25.179
That's all I want.

54:25.221 --> 54:28.265
So go on. Be happy.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.062
You, too.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.566
I love you.

54:37.608 --> 54:41.028
Oh, I love you, too.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.618
Oh, piss off. Go on.

55:14.103 --> 55:15.896
Come here, you dirty Critch.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.648
Those are the orders.
Back to the Row.

55:17.690 --> 55:19.650
Okay, move along, thank you.

55:19.692 --> 55:21.652
Pardon me.

55:21.694 --> 55:24.572
Thank you.

55:24.613 --> 55:28.325
Uh, you can't be here.
You have to go back to the Row.

55:28.367 --> 55:29.952
Back to the Row? Why?

55:29.994 --> 55:32.371
You don't understand.
We're just trying to leave.

55:32.413 --> 55:34.290
No Critch are getting in
or out of the city

55:34.331 --> 55:36.625
- until further notice.
- Why? What's going on?

55:36.667 --> 55:39.670
The chancellor's been
assassinated by Puck cultists.

55:39.712 --> 55:42.548
All Critch are to be sequestered
to the Row.

55:42.590 --> 55:44.967
No exceptions.

55:51.182 --> 55:55.394
We're being signaled
back into port, sir.

55:55.436 --> 55:57.980
All vessels are to return.

55:59.982 --> 56:02.234
Ignore them.

56:04.487 --> 56:06.864
Let them chase us
if they'd like.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.992
What course shall we set?

56:10.034 --> 56:13.996
The captain would like to know
where to take us.

56:15.039 --> 56:17.041
Somewhere new.

56:18.959 --> 56:20.628
Somewhere far away.

56:24.173 --> 56:25.424
Surprise us.

56:25.466 --> 56:28.803
Ma'am. Sir.

56:44.568 --> 56:46.129
"I'm sure the papers
would pay very good money

56:46.153 --> 56:47.672
"to hear the story
of the half-blood son

56:47.696 --> 56:50.491
I bore by the chancellor."

57:05.131 --> 57:08.050
Colors suit you.

57:08.092 --> 57:09.885
Looking over your speech?

57:11.929 --> 57:14.348
Actually I was just considering
your offer.

57:14.390 --> 57:16.851
Of marriage.

57:16.892 --> 57:19.103
Marriage? You make it sound
so small and ordinary.

57:19.145 --> 57:21.689
- And what were you thinking?
- A dynasty.

57:21.730 --> 57:24.150
What were you thinking?

57:24.191 --> 57:26.402
I was thinking it looks rather
like this blackmail note

57:26.443 --> 57:27.903
that was sent to my mother.

57:33.784 --> 57:35.786
Aren't you the clever one?

57:35.828 --> 57:38.664
It's true.

57:38.706 --> 57:41.417
You're responsible
for everything.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.436
I confess I wasn't expecting you
to work that out so soon.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.755
Still, it's exciting to know
I can still be surprised.

57:46.797 --> 57:48.966
How did you know...?

57:49.008 --> 57:51.343
The secret was so... buried.

57:51.385 --> 57:54.722
Nothing is ever truly buried
from those who look.

57:54.763 --> 57:56.158
My father had been collecting
dirt on the chancellor

57:56.182 --> 57:57.433
for quite some time.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.727
He was bound to chance
upon the rumors.

57:59.768 --> 58:01.979
Devastating if true.

58:02.021 --> 58:04.148
But he refused
to make use of them

58:04.190 --> 58:07.109
beyond the occasional jab
or insinuation

58:07.151 --> 58:09.195
on the floor of Parliament.

58:09.236 --> 58:13.240
Some residual feelings
for your mother, I expect.

58:13.282 --> 58:16.368
I, of course,
had no such compunction.

58:16.410 --> 58:18.287
No such compunction?
My father's

58:18.329 --> 58:20.164
fucking dead because
of this letter!

58:20.206 --> 58:21.433
And yet your eyes
are perfectly clear.

58:21.457 --> 58:24.627
Why is that?
Tell me, have you wept at all?

58:24.668 --> 58:27.087
I could have you put in irons.

58:27.129 --> 58:29.256
You could... but you won't.

58:29.298 --> 58:30.883
Give me one reason not to.

58:30.925 --> 58:32.843
You're about to march out there

58:32.885 --> 58:34.803
and announce
that the most powerful city

58:34.845 --> 58:37.056
in the world has a new leader.

58:37.097 --> 58:39.350
Because of that letter.

58:40.768 --> 58:43.187
Isn't it curious that the stroke
of a girl's pen

58:43.229 --> 58:45.564
can change
the course of history?

58:48.525 --> 58:50.694
Why did you do this?

58:50.736 --> 58:54.573
Because chaos
creates opportunity.

58:54.615 --> 58:56.492
For what?

58:56.533 --> 58:57.826
For us.

59:00.996 --> 59:02.748
They are ready for you, sir.

59:02.790 --> 59:06.710
You are chancellor now.

59:06.752 --> 59:09.088
The real game is about to begin.

59:09.129 --> 59:12.633
It's time for you to decide.

59:12.675 --> 59:15.386
Are we to be friends?

59:15.427 --> 59:18.138
Or are we to be enemies?

59:29.233 --> 59:32.027
Ladies and gentlemen
of Parliament...

59:32.069 --> 59:36.615
the Leader of the Opposition
and the Chancellor.

59:55.384 --> 59:58.929
My friends...

59:58.971 --> 01:00:01.598
I come to you at this moment
of great loss

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.851
with an urgent message.

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:07.313
We are a city under siege.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.231
From threats the likes of which

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.859
my father
could not have fathomed.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:16.739
Threats from without...
and within.

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:23.579
We stand at the precipice
of a great and secret war.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.541
It is not a war we asked for.

01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:30.878
But by God,
it is a war we will win!

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.926
Even now,
measures are being taken

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.763
to protect the people
of this great city.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.974
We will prevail.

01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:48.812
We will steel ourselves against
those who plot our destruction.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:54.735
We will meet their eyes
and not blink.

01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:56.695
We will not compromise.

01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:59.239
We will not negotiate.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:00.616
Come on, move along.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.409
See, now,
I believe you've made a mistake.

01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:04.161
I was born here.

01:01:04.203 --> 01:01:06.663
No exceptions, come on.
Keep moving.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.461
We will hunt them...

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:15.589
to the very edge of the world.

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:26.016
We do not know
what the future holds.

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:29.978
But we know this.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:34.900
Petty politics have divided
this chamber for far too long.

01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:36.527
Divided we are weak.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:40.239
We cannot be weak.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.324
Not today.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:45.953
Today we have a common enemy.

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:51.291
And we must stand as one
if we are to prevail.

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:56.713
I ask you now...

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:02.636
...honorable leader
of the opposition.

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:05.722
Will you stand with me?

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:15.315
I will.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:18.401
We will!

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.476
Fuck this, I'm leaving.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:51.685
Fleury.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.322
Vignette!

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:11.163
Vignette!

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:13.207
There you go, darling.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:18.253
You're all right, mate.
You're all right.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.796
Just Critch, mate, move along.

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:23.175
Philo!

01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:32.309
Philo, I beg you,
don't make trouble.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.522
I'll find a way out.

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:38.774
We've got a flier!

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.126
- Let me go!
- Fleury, they'll shoot you

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.736
out of the fucking sky!
No!

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.283
Oh, God.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.452
I'll find a way.

01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:25.112
I told you, mate.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.364
It's just Critch.
Move on.

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:32.244
I am Critch.

01:04:57.311 --> 01:04:59.896
Thank you, Chancellor.

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:03.025
A new day is dawning.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:06.069
A change is coming
to this city.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:09.865
Together, we have crossed
a line in the sand.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.909
And we can never go back.
