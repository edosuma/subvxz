00:10.940 --> 00:13.684
That's wonderful. Do you have
any views on lesbian priests?

00:13.809 --> 00:16.186
- I'm not interested.
- Masturbation?

00:16.311 --> 00:18.355
- I don't believe in it.
- Just let it be?

00:18.480 --> 00:19.940
Just let it all hang out.

00:20.065 --> 00:22.443
Do you believe in that statute in Arizona

00:22.568 --> 00:26.405
that says if you get an erection
it's a felony or a misdemeanour?

00:26.530 --> 00:30.492
You can't go around and
expose yourself to everybody.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:45.757 --> 00:49.261
The welfare system is creating
generations of freeloaders.

00:49.386 --> 00:53.056
So overexaggerated, welfare.
You're worried about a mother of eight.

00:53.182 --> 00:56.059
If these are reborn Christians
as they claim they are,

00:56.185 --> 01:00.606
if they took care of the underprivileged,
we wouldn't have a welfare state.

01:00.731 --> 01:05.027
Instead of building glass cathedrals,
buying TV stations, paying off prostitutes.

01:05.152 --> 01:08.780
If Jesus came back today
he'd never stop throwing up.

01:14.203 --> 01:17.456
Since he's repeatedly talked about
his homosexuality on the air,

01:17.581 --> 01:19.625
you're very quick, you know?

01:19.750 --> 01:24.004
You know what I saw this morning
that was real disgusting?

01:24.129 --> 01:26.173
Yeah, you saw yourself in a mirror.

01:31.553 --> 01:34.848
Why are you listenin' now?
You must have a need to be miserable.

01:34.973 --> 01:37.142
You don't make me miserable.

01:37.267 --> 01:40.103
You see what a hypocrite
you're makin' of yourself?

01:40.228 --> 01:44.858
You can't enjoy my show, cos you got
no sense of humour. Take a hike!

01:49.446 --> 01:52.032
- How much did you say you weigh?
- 167.

01:52.157 --> 01:56.453
That's insane. Your body's
supposed to be a temple, a cathedral.

01:56.578 --> 02:01.124
You're making it a garbage disposal.
Call me up when you lose 50 pounds.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.462
Weapons is a big business.
We fall for the old patriotic crap.

02:05.587 --> 02:08.507
Right now, Iran is the most
hated country in the US.

02:08.632 --> 02:10.925
We need an enemy
so we can make more weapons.

02:11.050 --> 02:14.846
In ten years we'll all be driving
Iranian cars, the Khomeini wagon,

02:14.972 --> 02:17.516
and goin' to chichi Iranian restaurants.

02:17.641 --> 02:20.143
Remember what barbarians the Japs were?

02:20.268 --> 02:23.355
You're always doing all the speaking.

02:38.495 --> 02:40.539
21 minutes remaining in the hour.

02:40.664 --> 02:44.918
Hey, people, you know what
we're talkin' about tonight?

02:45.043 --> 02:48.463
Jew-boys. Anti-Semitism, racism, hate.

02:48.588 --> 02:51.425
There's a lotta kike-haters
among you nice Gentiles.

02:51.550 --> 02:56.138
Let's hear from you. You're not ashamed
of what you believe in, are you?

02:56.263 --> 03:00.434
This is Kraus. WLD, the voice of
the Midwest. 90,000 watts from Chicago.

03:00.559 --> 03:04.730
Sickago. Whatever you wanna call it.
Hey, you know what, partner?

03:04.855 --> 03:08.650
I'm an old Jew myself. Yeah.
Show me how brave you are, now.

03:08.775 --> 03:13.155
Call up this Jew-boy and we'll
talk turkey right after this message.

03:14.030 --> 03:17.659
- You're askin' for it tonight, Dan.
- Fuck 'em if they can't take it.

03:17.784 --> 03:22.289
You hate Jews because they all
got syphilis? How do you know that?

03:22.414 --> 03:24.916
It's in the Bible, in Genesis.

03:25.041 --> 03:27.669
Don't tell me about the Bible.
You never read it.

03:27.794 --> 03:31.006
A TV evangelist quoted you
the anti-Semitic parts. Take a walk!

03:31.214 --> 03:33.550
Line two, you're on the air. What?

03:33.675 --> 03:38.013
I just wanted to say that the Holocaust,
that was a big exaggeration.

03:38.138 --> 03:40.056
An exaggeration?

03:40.182 --> 03:43.602
I mean, there were some Jews killed,
but that was just war.

03:43.727 --> 03:47.772
- There were a lot of Gis killed too.
- What about the gas chambers?

03:47.898 --> 03:51.359
All that was, those Jews
had to get their lice taken off.

03:51.485 --> 03:55.739
- It was like taking 'em to the dry-cleaners.
- Did you say dry-cleaners?

03:55.864 --> 03:59.701
Uh-huh. You take somethin' to
the dry-cleaners, it don't hurt it any.

03:59.826 --> 04:03.038
Sometimes it shrinks a little,
but you can still wear it.

04:03.163 --> 04:08.335
People say "How can you let
these guys on the air with all their hate?"

04:08.460 --> 04:12.589
Short of inciting a riot, let 'em say
what they want, as ugly as it may be.

04:12.714 --> 04:15.467
That's a free enterprise of ideas.

04:15.592 --> 04:17.636
Bye-bye.

04:17.928 --> 04:21.765
- We just about blew the damn board.
- Bob, what've we got tomorrow?

04:21.890 --> 04:25.310
- Transsexuals.
- God bless America.

04:26.561 --> 04:28.104
Good night.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.602
No!

06:53.583 --> 06:56.461
Damn you, son of a bitch.
I'll kick the shit outta you.

06:56.586 --> 06:58.630
Lighten up, Ronnie.

06:59.589 --> 07:01.633
Boy, you got a mouth on you.

07:08.389 --> 07:11.351
My boy and me were target shootin'.

07:11.476 --> 07:13.853
I guess we forgot all about it.

07:13.978 --> 07:17.607
Do you know what somethin'
like that would do to my rotor?

07:17.732 --> 07:20.443
I didn't think you were
gonna cut this section today.

07:20.568 --> 07:25.114
- You're supposed to clear these fields.
- Ooh, you got a temper too, don't ya?

07:25.240 --> 07:27.951
- Maybe.
- Where you from, girl?

07:28.076 --> 07:30.536
- Texas.
- Real cowgirl, huh?

07:31.871 --> 07:35.583
Look, I don't need this shit.
I'm just trying to do my job.

07:45.218 --> 07:49.722
What do you get if you mix five Mexicans,
a Chinaman and five coloured?

07:49.847 --> 07:51.891
A water sprinkler that sounds like this.

07:52.016 --> 07:55.728
Spic-spic-spic-spic-spic-chink-
nigger-nigger-nigger-nigger-nigger.

07:56.104 --> 07:58.773
Give me a Colorado Motherfucker.

07:58.898 --> 08:01.317
Yes, ma'am.

08:01.442 --> 08:04.487
- Ever have a Colorado Motherfucker?
- Mm-mm.

08:05.446 --> 08:07.657
He's cute.

08:10.451 --> 08:13.496
I'm real glad I went back on the pill.

08:13.621 --> 08:16.290
Here's your Motherfucker, ma'am.

08:16.416 --> 08:19.502
- Taste this. You gotta taste this.
- No, thanks.

08:33.683 --> 08:36.394
...backs his car
into the window of the bank

08:36.519 --> 08:42.442
and dumps the cow on the floor of the
lobby, to pay 'em back for what he owes.

08:42.567 --> 08:47.280
- You're yankin' my chain.
- I'm not. It really happened in Crawford.

08:51.451 --> 08:53.494
- Who is she?
- I never seen her before.

08:53.619 --> 08:55.663
She must be from the combines.

09:03.212 --> 09:06.174
Hey, cowgirl. Buy you a beer.

09:06.299 --> 09:09.051
- Got a beer.
- Well, I'll buy you another beer.

09:10.052 --> 09:11.929
No, thanks.

09:12.054 --> 09:15.975
You always like this,
or do some folks just bring it out in you?

09:17.518 --> 09:21.230
Come on, Texas, let's go out there.
We can have one dance, can't we?

09:21.355 --> 09:25.276
I'll keep my hands in my pockets
and I won't bust your feet. I promise.

09:33.576 --> 09:36.329
You can take your hands
out of your pockets.

09:39.373 --> 09:41.334
Yee-haw!

09:44.128 --> 09:46.130
Let's get outta here.

09:47.256 --> 09:49.717
- What's your name?
- Katie Phillips.

09:50.968 --> 09:52.970
I'm Gary. Hi.

09:55.723 --> 09:59.644
So, you dance with all the girls
who work the combines?

09:59.769 --> 10:03.356
Honey, you combine girls
are the biggest thing to hit this town.

10:03.481 --> 10:08.945
These old boys here, every year about
this time, they think it's Santa Claus.

10:11.239 --> 10:13.241
- Texas, right?
- Texas.

10:16.744 --> 10:19.830
It's the first time I've danced
in three years.

10:19.956 --> 10:22.083
- Right.
- Since my wife died.

10:23.209 --> 10:25.044
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:25.419 --> 10:28.422
<i>♪ And sing of Rosa Lee</i>

10:28.589 --> 10:32.969
<i>♪ But the Yellow Rose of Texas
beats the belles of Tennessee</i>

10:33.094 --> 10:37.014
Old Doc Adams, if he didn't know
somethin', he'd tell you it was nerves.

10:37.181 --> 10:41.978
These young doctors, in air-conditioned
offices, usin' all these big words...

10:42.144 --> 10:45.314
They tell you what you got.
I liked it better the other way.

10:45.481 --> 10:48.067
What is it exactly you do got, Shorty?

10:48.234 --> 10:50.236
Haemorrhoids.

10:51.153 --> 10:53.489
Howdy, Hank.

10:53.656 --> 10:56.200
- I said howdy, Hank.
- Howdy.

11:02.290 --> 11:05.835
I gotta go. I gotta put my kids to bed.

11:06.669 --> 11:10.172
- I'll give you a ride.
- I'll just be ridin' with Betty J...

11:13.426 --> 11:16.178
I think Betty Jo is gonna need the car.

11:16.345 --> 11:19.015
Wayne isn't old enough
for a driver's licence yet.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.892
Come on. I'll keep my hands in my pockets.

11:22.059 --> 11:25.146
You ever seen a man drive with his feet?

11:27.440 --> 11:31.736
- You like workin' them combines?
- Well, I used to work in a diner.

11:31.861 --> 11:35.197
You know, waitin' tips
and pushin' their hands away.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.288
I miss that guy.
You ever listen to that guy?

11:42.455 --> 11:46.584
- Radio guy that got killed.
- Oh, I just saw about it on the TV.

11:47.877 --> 11:51.922
Yeah, well, there ain't nothin'
on the radio now, that's for sure.

11:52.048 --> 11:54.467
There's rock'n'roll.

11:54.633 --> 11:58.554
I hate rock'n'roll.
It gives me a headache.

11:58.721 --> 12:00.973
I suppose you like rock'n'roll?

12:01.140 --> 12:03.642
I hate heavy metal.
That gives me a headache.

12:03.809 --> 12:07.146
- Hey, we got somethin' in common.
- Yeah.

12:13.694 --> 12:16.072
Hey! Hello!

12:16.697 --> 12:18.699
Hello!

12:26.665 --> 12:28.918
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:29.084 --> 12:32.755
- Daddy said to bring this. I'm Rachel.
- Well, thanks, Rachel.

12:32.922 --> 12:37.384
Daddy said to ask you to come over
to dinner with us tonight.

12:38.385 --> 12:42.014
- Excuse me. Dinner?
- Grandma's makin' a pot roast.

12:42.181 --> 12:43.390
A pot roast?

12:43.557 --> 12:46.393
She makes the best pot roast
in the whole wide world.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.687
- What does she put in it?
- Garlic.

12:48.854 --> 12:50.397
Garlic? You like garlic?

12:50.564 --> 12:54.777
Yep. But if I eat too much, I get diarrhoea.
Do you ever get diarrhoea?

12:54.944 --> 12:57.613
- I sure try not to.
- Is it fun riding up there?

12:57.780 --> 13:00.241
- It is. You want a ride?
- Sure.

13:00.407 --> 13:03.661
You got great music up here.

13:03.828 --> 13:06.413
Wait till I tell Joey.
He's gonna get red-assed.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.041
- Who's Joey?
- My brother.

13:28.978 --> 13:31.313
- Hi, Shorty.
- Hi, Katie. How you doin'?

13:31.480 --> 13:33.482
- Good.
- Good.

13:35.859 --> 13:40.739
- Hi! I stuck my finger in the pot roast.
- Ooh, is it good?

13:40.906 --> 13:43.325
Great. Grandma, Katie's here.

13:43.492 --> 13:46.161
Hi. I'm Gladys. Gary's mom.

13:46.328 --> 13:49.415
- Hi. Katie Phillips.
- That roast is all ready.

13:49.582 --> 13:53.794
I don't know where the fellas are.
Probably tendin' to that poor old horse.

13:53.961 --> 13:56.880
Sit yourself down.
Would you like somethin' to drink?

13:57.047 --> 14:00.968
- She likes beer.
- Ah. I think I'll join you.

14:01.135 --> 14:03.137
It's so darned hot.

14:03.304 --> 14:06.932
She never lets me do anything.
She still thinks I'm a baby.

14:07.099 --> 14:11.145
Our horse is real sick.
I hope she'll be OK.

14:12.021 --> 14:15.524
Hi, Katie. This is my son Joey.

14:15.691 --> 14:17.818
Pleasure to meet you.

14:17.985 --> 14:20.821
There's the next President.
Ain't that a kick in the ass?

14:20.946 --> 14:24.783
Is that what you wanna do
when you grow up?

14:24.950 --> 14:26.410
Oh.

14:27.161 --> 14:33.000
I'm announcing my candidacy because it's
time for someone to start telling the truth.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.169
Who knows? Maybe, huh, Joey?

14:35.294 --> 14:38.589
Sit down, please. Get comfortable.

14:40.007 --> 14:43.344
- We have to return America...
- You can sit here.

14:43.469 --> 14:45.512
...to real Americans.

14:45.637 --> 14:49.433
That's the message
of the Jack Carpenter candidacy.

14:49.558 --> 14:52.019
Well, he's kinda cute.

14:52.144 --> 14:56.982
Him? He's a turkey.
They're all a bunch of turkeys.

14:58.317 --> 15:01.153
Hey, thanks, Mom.
Just what I wanted. Katie?

15:01.278 --> 15:04.114
- I'll get another for myself.
- Oh.

15:04.239 --> 15:09.745
...tried and tested in the bureaucratic
battlefield in Washington.

15:09.870 --> 15:13.207
May I introduce Mr Robert Flynn.

15:13.332 --> 15:16.877
- Bob?
- Thank you, Jack.

15:17.002 --> 15:18.420
Bobby.

15:18.545 --> 15:23.050
What this country desperately needs

15:23.175 --> 15:25.844
is leadership.

15:25.969 --> 15:31.100
And Jack Carpenter is a leader
who can put this country back on track.

15:31.225 --> 15:33.227
Do you know...

15:33.852 --> 15:36.188
- Excuse me.
- That's OK.

15:37.272 --> 15:39.399
Do you know him?

15:39.525 --> 15:42.152
Nah.

15:42.277 --> 15:47.908
Give us your best shot. We expect a lot of
your left-Iiberal barbs and we're ready.

15:48.033 --> 15:51.036
- I'm really glad you came.
- Thanks.

15:51.745 --> 15:57.125
You guys... Maybe you oughta wash
your hands before dinner or somethin'?

15:58.919 --> 16:01.505
Mm. This tastes so good.

16:01.630 --> 16:04.466
Do you think I could have
some more potatoes?

16:06.426 --> 16:10.722
- She's still growin'. Eats like a mule.
- Well, she looks growed just fine to me.

16:11.014 --> 16:12.432
Me too.

16:12.558 --> 16:16.770
- Did you really give her a ride?
- I told you he was gonna get red-assed.

16:16.895 --> 16:19.940
Young lady, I'm just gonna
wash your mouth out with soap.

16:20.065 --> 16:22.860
- Daddy says it.
- Well, Daddy's a man.

16:22.985 --> 16:25.153
Can you give me a ride sometime too?

16:25.279 --> 16:28.782
- She's real busy. She got work to do.
- Sure I can, Joey.

16:28.907 --> 16:32.703
Thanks! Can she ride on the
merry-go-round with us tomorrow too?

16:32.828 --> 16:36.373
- Don't know why not, if...
- Neato! That's neato!

16:37.398 --> 16:41.461
Before you excuse yourself, young man,
you help Grandma clear the table.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.009
We got white cake later, if you want.

16:47.134 --> 16:50.262
- Oh, I love white cake.
- I do hate those store-bought cakes.

16:50.387 --> 16:53.140
All smell of the Cellophane
they're wrapped in.

16:53.265 --> 16:56.935
I always bake my cakes from scratch.
No matter if anybody else does.

16:57.060 --> 17:01.523
- Not just cake, but everything's changing.
- Don't get yourself all riled up, Mom.

17:01.648 --> 17:04.693
- You know it ain't right.
- You know I know it, Mom.

17:04.818 --> 17:08.821
It just ain't the same country
I grew up in, that's all.

17:08.946 --> 17:11.282
The bad just pushes out the good.

17:11.407 --> 17:14.661
- There's filth and trash everyplace.
- Mom.

17:15.787 --> 17:18.790
Sorry. I'll just go and get my white cake.

17:20.541 --> 17:23.337
Well, it's hard around here.

17:23.462 --> 17:27.590
Old people losing their past.
Young people losing their farms.

17:29.426 --> 17:34.139
- Nobody does anything about it.
- I know. I grew up in a town just like this.

17:35.849 --> 17:38.435
- Was that picture taken in...
- Oh.

17:41.396 --> 17:44.775
- Mom, I asked you not to put this out.
- Well, I like it.

17:49.196 --> 17:53.408
Hey, this is the best white cake
in the whole white world, isn't it?

17:53.533 --> 17:55.452
- You hush.
- It is.

18:16.439 --> 18:17.808
Yeah!

18:26.733 --> 18:30.028
- No, more, Dad!
- Aaah!

18:30.153 --> 18:32.197
Yes!

18:34.157 --> 18:36.159
Oh, let's go by Uncle Sam.

18:36.284 --> 18:39.830
- I'll take one of you guys together.
- OK, smile.

18:39.955 --> 18:41.957
Smile!

18:42.082 --> 18:43.416
Great.

18:44.042 --> 18:49.214
- Here you are, darlin'.
- Oh, wait, Shorty. Let me get your picture.

18:49.339 --> 18:53.885
You taste these, you're gonna
leave this big ugly thing for me.

18:54.010 --> 18:57.681
- How long you been drivin' combines?
- It's just only my first year.

18:57.806 --> 19:01.184
- Do you like it?
- I like travellin' around meetin' people.

19:01.309 --> 19:05.397
- But I don't like the motels much.
- I can understand that.

19:05.522 --> 19:08.567
- Thank you.
- Hey, Lyle. You know Katie?

19:08.692 --> 19:11.862
- Yeah.
- Lyle went way back with my dad.

19:11.987 --> 19:16.283
There was a real man for you. He could
eat a bear for breakfast and shit bullets.

19:16.408 --> 19:18.618
How do you know he shit bullets, Lyle?

19:18.743 --> 19:21.997
- Your mouth full of obscenities again?
- Hiya, Reverend.

19:22.122 --> 19:25.166
- Hey, I got somethin' for you, Reverend.
- Hey!

19:25.292 --> 19:27.335
There's the old quarterback.

19:40.807 --> 19:42.976
Hey, Gary!

19:43.101 --> 19:46.730
When the hell are we gonna go huntin'?
I'm gettin' rusty.

19:49.316 --> 19:52.193
I don't know, Buster,
but I'll let you know.

19:54.696 --> 19:58.950
- You ever been huntin'?
- When I was young, my daddy took me.

19:59.075 --> 20:02.746
I got cherry bombs,
snappin' crackers and big nukes.

20:02.871 --> 20:08.335
Hellfire, Buster, you got enough stuff there
to blow up the town on the Fourth of July.

20:08.460 --> 20:11.963
Government's found a new way
to put the farmers back on their feet.

20:12.088 --> 20:16.176
- How's that, Shorty?
- It's gonna take away the pick-ups.

20:18.887 --> 20:21.765
Say, why are you taking all the pictures?

20:21.890 --> 20:25.977
I always take a lot of pictures.
I got a whole album of 'em at home.

20:27.062 --> 20:32.108
What is the matter with you, Wes? Scared
your face is gonna bust the camera?

21:10.522 --> 21:12.774
- You ain't gonna invite me in, are you?
- No.

21:12.899 --> 21:14.943
It ain't time yet, is it?

21:15.068 --> 21:20.240
Well, you better go in, or else I'm gonna
end up making your bed or somethin'.

21:20.365 --> 21:24.452
Hey, girl. Happy Independence Day.

21:34.796 --> 21:38.133
Hello. Yes.

21:42.971 --> 21:47.350
They're all in the barn.
It's Beauty. She's too sick.

21:47.475 --> 21:50.812
Daddy said we're gonna
have to put her to sleep.

21:56.860 --> 22:01.239
Please, Dad, we don't have to.
She'll be OK. She'll be all right, Dad.

22:01.364 --> 22:05.285
- Katie, tell him, please. Katie, tell him!
- I can't watch it.

23:16.147 --> 23:20.401
I gotta go. My mama's gonna have
an operation. I just got a call.

23:21.152 --> 23:23.571
- When are you comin' back?
- Couple of days.

23:23.696 --> 23:28.368
I can't get any work done anyway.
It's gonna take a while for it to dry out.

23:28.493 --> 23:32.747
- Where are you goin'?
- Her mom's sick. She's goin' home.

23:32.914 --> 23:35.958
- Ain't you gonna give me my ride?
- Sure she is, Joey.

23:36.084 --> 23:38.169
- You promise?
- I promise.

23:40.004 --> 23:42.256
I'm sorry about Beauty, Gary.

23:44.467 --> 23:47.470
Katie, we'll be waitin' for you.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.044
Weaver.

24:22.505 --> 24:24.590
Put your tag on, Miss Weaver.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.721
- ...his, uh, his father.
- No, please.

24:30.847 --> 24:33.182
You say no, but we all do.

24:34.517 --> 24:36.602
Gary Simmons's father, sir.

24:37.019 --> 24:40.314
His father joined
the Sons of Liberty in 1978.

24:40.440 --> 24:44.986
He refused to pay his taxes. The IRS went
after him. They put a lien on his farm.

24:45.111 --> 24:48.656
His father hung himself. His wife
divorced him, moved to California.

24:48.781 --> 24:53.035
She was killed in a hit-and-run accident.
The driver was never apprehended.

24:53.161 --> 24:56.414
Her body was so badly bruised,
we believe the driver reversed

24:56.539 --> 24:58.124
and drove over her again.

24:58.249 --> 25:01.085
Can we put him
out in California at the time?

25:01.210 --> 25:04.172
We are still working on it.

25:04.297 --> 25:07.758
He almost won the Medal of Honor
when he ran into a VC bunker

25:07.884 --> 25:10.428
and killed five Vietcong
after being wounded.

25:10.553 --> 25:12.638
He did win a medal for being wounded.

25:13.431 --> 25:17.935
- He did win a medal for a wound.
- What did you find, Weaver?

25:18.060 --> 25:20.980
She hasn't found anything yet,
sir, but we're still...

25:21.105 --> 25:23.524
I don't believe there is anything to find.

25:23.649 --> 25:26.194
I'm afraid I'm being sent
on a wild-goose chase.

25:26.569 --> 25:29.947
A car like his was seen
speeding away from Kraus's garage.

25:30.072 --> 25:34.994
A half-drunk witness identified two digits
in a licence plate in a car similar to his.

25:35.119 --> 25:37.163
All right.

25:37.288 --> 25:40.041
Now, whose side are you on, anyway? His?

25:40.166 --> 25:44.629
Don't start that shit with me, Michael.
My loyalties are perfectly intact.

25:44.754 --> 25:48.966
No one mentioned your loyalties,
but we've heard a lot about his family,

25:49.091 --> 25:52.094
his fondness for white cake,
his fondness for horses...

25:52.220 --> 25:54.972
Hey, what are we doing here?
Are we targeting him?

25:55.097 --> 25:57.558
- On what basis?
- On my gut's basis, OK?

25:57.683 --> 25:59.685
I've a very sensitive gut.

25:59.810 --> 26:04.482
Comes from a long-time-standing
proximity to certain erogenous zones.

26:04.607 --> 26:07.944
What about the Chicago PD?
What are they coming up with?

26:08.069 --> 26:10.780
- Marty?
- We got over 100 people on the case, sir.

26:10.905 --> 26:15.034
We got nothin'. As far as we're concerned,
Gary Simmons is a real long shot.

26:15.159 --> 26:16.744
See any guns?

26:16.869 --> 26:20.665
Duffin, they got more guns
in that part of the country than people.

26:20.790 --> 26:24.752
If you're talkin' about Mac-10s, no.
Look, Kraus was a lightning rod.

26:24.877 --> 26:30.091
- Anyone with a radio coulda killed him.
- So Gary's got a radio, right?

26:30.216 --> 26:33.970
Dog-lovers, left-wingers, right-wingers.
Anyone coulda done it.

26:34.095 --> 26:38.391
You skipped the fat ladies.
You wanna know what my gut instinct is?

26:38.516 --> 26:42.144
- The fat ladies got him.
- They certainly had cause.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.356
Let me know what you decide.

26:52.321 --> 26:54.365
That's his ex-wife.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.369
OK, guys, that'll do it for today, thanks.

27:05.710 --> 27:08.170
- I think what you're doing is great.
- Thank you.

27:08.295 --> 27:11.507
- Al Sanders, in from DC.
- Nice to meet you.

27:11.632 --> 27:16.053
Catherine Weaver, first time undercover,
acting like 16-year-old on first date.

27:16.178 --> 27:18.848
- I love 16-year-olds.
- You're sick, Duffin.

27:18.973 --> 27:21.600
All you yuppies are sick.

27:21.726 --> 27:25.020
Anyway, it's nice to see ya.

27:25.146 --> 27:27.189
I missed you.

27:31.652 --> 27:33.988
- You look great.
- Thanks, Michael.

27:36.407 --> 27:40.202
- Well, I always did like this view.
- Oh, Michael, you really piss me off.

27:40.327 --> 27:43.372
- Good. We still feel the same.
- No, we don't.

27:43.497 --> 27:47.918
Come on over here.
I really, really did miss you.

27:48.627 --> 27:50.671
The Reverend.

27:50.796 --> 27:53.174
Wes. Shorty.

27:54.258 --> 27:58.387
And Dean, he's the sheriff's deputy.
And the guy is a war hero.

27:58.512 --> 28:03.726
- Are you gonna hold all that against him?
- Not in the '80s. It's back in style.

28:03.851 --> 28:06.604
Gary's no more violent
or racist than anyone up here.

28:06.729 --> 28:09.857
- What does that mean?
- It means they tell black jokes.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.109
Whaddaya got on this guy?

28:13.277 --> 28:16.113
It's a beautiful baby, don't you think?

28:16.780 --> 28:19.617
- What about ZOG?
- What'd you expect, Michael?

28:19.742 --> 28:23.662
That I'd see "ZOG" painted on the side
of the barn next to "Duane loves Mary"?

28:23.787 --> 28:26.248
Who's Duane?

28:26.373 --> 28:30.002
Think there's any reason
to consistently muddied licence plates?

28:30.127 --> 28:32.922
Yes. When it rains, farm fields get muddy.

28:33.047 --> 28:36.467
He smells too good. He's the kind of guy
who needs an Alamo to defend.

28:36.592 --> 28:40.888
- He's perfect for the part.
- We want him to be perfect for the part.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.852
He's a good-looking guy, right, Cathy?

28:49.480 --> 28:52.149
You want something?
I'll give you something.

28:52.274 --> 28:56.779
- He named his dog after Ronald Reagan.
- Well, he ain't all bad.

29:07.289 --> 29:10.501
- Hi. Hi, Catherine.
- Hi, Jasper.

29:20.719 --> 29:24.056
Your mother had her operation
in St Joseph's Hospital in Dallas.

29:24.223 --> 29:29.061
She's in room 320. Her name is Emma.
She'll be home in a week in Wells.

29:29.228 --> 29:33.357
We'll have an agent there. Your home
phone number is 214-817-1701.

29:33.482 --> 29:36.568
Memorise that. If you need me,
I can be there in 1 ½ hours.

29:36.694 --> 29:38.070
You're paranoid.

29:38.237 --> 29:41.365
I didn't recruit you off that campus
to lose you now.

29:41.532 --> 29:43.742
You already lost me.

29:45.661 --> 29:48.497
I thought maybe you were gonna ask me up.

29:48.622 --> 29:51.375
- Let it go.
- I don't want to.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.293
I do.

29:53.794 --> 29:57.297
Don't you think you like this guy
just a little bit too much?

29:57.464 --> 30:01.176
I like him. Ain't that the shits, huh?

30:01.844 --> 30:04.263
It is, where I come from.

30:04.430 --> 30:06.807
I like you too.

30:06.974 --> 30:11.979
- What's your mother's phone number?
- 214-817-1702.

30:12.146 --> 30:14.815
- 01.
- 01.

30:24.491 --> 30:27.578
Rachel! Joey!

30:30.497 --> 30:32.583
Hello? Rachel?

30:32.750 --> 30:35.169
They've all gone to church!

30:37.546 --> 30:43.927
We are mugged on our streets,
and our neighbours are afraid to help us.

30:44.887 --> 30:50.309
Our children's minds
are poisoned with filth.

30:50.434 --> 30:57.399
And our judges are afraid to cast that filth
into the fires of righteousness!

30:58.025 --> 31:03.363
Our schools can teach
that we come from apes,

31:03.530 --> 31:09.661
but can't teach
that we are created by God.

31:09.828 --> 31:13.123
- How's your mom?
- She's fine.

31:13.290 --> 31:16.502
Our cities are dying of sexual disease.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.754
- Amen.
- Amen.

31:19.963 --> 31:27.304
The Lord's wrath comes down on those
who live by promiscuity and perversion!

31:27.471 --> 31:29.181
Amen.

31:29.598 --> 31:38.857
Listen to me, Americans. We are the true
descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.

31:39.024 --> 31:42.653
We are God's chosen people!

31:43.195 --> 31:46.448
We are the sons of Abel.

31:46.615 --> 31:48.992
We must awaken.

31:49.451 --> 31:55.749
The time is comin'.
A long-forgotten wind is starting to blow.

31:55.916 --> 31:57.709
Amen.

31:57.834 --> 32:00.754
Right behind you, Grandma.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.548
He preaches with
the devil's own pitchfork.

32:03.674 --> 32:07.886
- The devil hasn't got a pitchfork.
- How do you know? You seen him?

32:08.053 --> 32:10.389
- A pitchfork.
- Hold on. I got somethin' for ya.

32:10.555 --> 32:12.766
You gonna come to Grandma's for dinner?

32:12.933 --> 32:17.145
We're gonna watch a cowboy movie.
Daddy loves cowboy movies.

32:17.312 --> 32:20.774
- You will come, won't you?
- Well, I gotta go check the fields.

32:20.941 --> 32:23.485
What for? They're still wet
even with this wind.

32:23.652 --> 32:26.238
You ain't gonna be weed-whackin' today.

32:26.405 --> 32:30.033
Why don't you guys ride home
with Grandma? We'll go get the beer.

32:34.246 --> 32:36.665
I love your family.

32:36.832 --> 32:41.420
It's sweet of you to say that, Katie.
You know what? I do too.

32:54.016 --> 32:56.018
What are we doing?

32:57.227 --> 32:59.604
I think we're lookin' for beer.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.591
No.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.760
Go slow.

34:14.137 --> 34:16.348
And take off your watch.

34:35.534 --> 34:39.079
That's the first time since my wife died.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.373
How did she die?

34:44.125 --> 34:47.629
Oh, she left me.
She went out to California.

34:50.047 --> 34:53.592
She got hit by a car.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.304
Maybe it was that goddamn war.

34:56.429 --> 35:01.309
Maybe I worked the farm too hard. Maybe
I didn't pay enough attention to her.

35:02.602 --> 35:04.813
Maybe she read too many magazines.

35:07.315 --> 35:09.359
It was my fault.

35:10.944 --> 35:13.738
But I learned from it.

35:26.251 --> 35:29.254
I don't wanna play Zog!
I wanna play dolly!

35:29.379 --> 35:31.464
You always wanna play dolly!

35:31.589 --> 35:33.842
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!

35:33.967 --> 35:36.928
I don't wanna play dolly!
I wanna play Zog!

35:40.140 --> 35:42.851
No! Stay here and play dolly with me!

35:42.976 --> 35:45.437
It's real easy. Here, take one.

35:45.562 --> 35:48.356
- I wanna play with my dolls.
- What are you playin'?

35:48.481 --> 35:51.609
- He never wants to play dolly.
- What do you wanna play?

35:51.735 --> 35:53.820
- I don't like dolls.
- What's Zog?

35:53.945 --> 35:57.157
- I don't know.
- Come on.

35:57.282 --> 36:01.661
Dog. It's a game. I'm the dog.
She's the cat. It's real dumb.

36:01.786 --> 36:04.247
- Morning.
- Morning.

36:04.372 --> 36:07.625
- Didn't you sleep good?
- No, I slept OK.

36:07.751 --> 36:10.420
Can you take me on the ride
on the combine now?

36:10.545 --> 36:13.048
- Sure.
- Hot shit, Dad, we're goin' on a ride!

36:13.173 --> 36:14.549
After breakfast.

36:19.846 --> 36:22.515
Hey, you wanna go huntin' with us tonight?

36:22.640 --> 36:26.061
- I'm truly tired.
- I'd really like you to come. It's important.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.146
Can I go huntin', Dad, please?

36:28.271 --> 36:30.565
- Maybe when you're bigger.
- I'm big, Dad.

36:30.690 --> 36:33.735
Yeah. Goddamn, it's hot today.

36:35.820 --> 36:39.032
Maybe we oughta
look for some beer later on.

36:41.326 --> 36:42.619
OK.

36:50.001 --> 36:54.089
Goddamn grain elevator.
It's always breakin' down.

36:54.214 --> 36:58.218
They get the parts in Aba Dabba
or some goddamn Arab place.

36:58.343 --> 37:02.806
Get the parts in Aba Dabba, send
the wheat to Russia, feed the commies,

37:02.931 --> 37:06.017
so they can sell the goddamn
equipment to the Aba Dabbas,

37:06.142 --> 37:09.062
so they can turn around and sell it to us,
so we can sit here

37:09.187 --> 37:11.856
and goddamn boil ourselves to death.

37:13.233 --> 37:15.610
I sure as goddamn shit don't get it.

37:21.699 --> 37:25.537
Goddamn it, Elmer!
What the goddamn shit is goin' on?

37:37.298 --> 37:41.803
Coke machine works. Least anyways
they don't make that in Aba Dabba.

37:42.554 --> 37:44.597
I don't think.

37:50.979 --> 37:53.022
Aw!

38:08.871 --> 38:11.791
- When we goin' huntin'?
- Told you. I don't like huntin'.

38:11.916 --> 38:13.960
Hey, you'll like this.

38:16.921 --> 38:19.340
How you doin', Del?

38:19.674 --> 38:22.010
Have a good crop this year?

38:22.135 --> 38:24.762
Had a pretty good crop myself.
How 'bout you?

38:24.887 --> 38:27.432
I'm talkin' to ya, Del.

38:28.224 --> 38:32.520
I'm talkin', Del.
One neighbour to another.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.897
Chewin' the shit, that's all.

38:35.023 --> 38:38.985
- I ain't heard you give me no answer, Del.
- You ain't no neighbour of mine.

38:39.110 --> 38:42.655
Come on, Gary. We don't want
no trouble. We're just waitin'.

38:42.780 --> 38:47.285
- What's that spot on your face, Jud?
- That's a birthmark, Gary.

38:47.410 --> 38:50.413
Yeah? You sure about that, Jud?

38:52.248 --> 38:56.085
It ain't one of them spots you get
from that there AIDS, is it, Jud?

38:56.210 --> 39:01.174
You ain't been airin' your back door
like one of them dyin', spotted faggots?

39:02.175 --> 39:05.261
- You son of a bitch.
- Don't fuck with me, Jud.

39:05.386 --> 39:08.765
You hear me, Del? You hear me, Del?

39:18.858 --> 39:21.527
What'd you do that for?

39:21.652 --> 39:24.655
I ain't the one who started it all.

39:24.781 --> 39:28.868
It ain't no big deal anyhow.
Some people here just don't like me.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.581
Katie...

39:35.541 --> 39:41.547
I'm gonna get down on my hands and
knees, right here, with all them lookin',

39:41.672 --> 39:43.883
unless you come huntin' with me.

39:44.008 --> 39:47.512
You know that, don't you? Yes, I am.

39:47.637 --> 39:50.139
All right. I'll go huntin'.

39:50.264 --> 39:52.683
- You're coming?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.603
OK.

39:59.023 --> 40:01.150
I've never been huntin' at night.

40:05.029 --> 40:08.741
Ah, it's gonna be a real mud hunt tonight.

40:08.866 --> 40:13.204
- What are we huntin'? Deer?
- It ain't deer season.

40:24.882 --> 40:26.926
Come on.

40:30.263 --> 40:32.306
- Shorty.
- Hi, Gary.

40:35.351 --> 40:38.437
Come on. Watch your step. It's slippery.

40:45.236 --> 40:48.656
All of you know Katie.

40:48.781 --> 40:52.577
- Hi, Katie.
- Give me a weapon, Shorty.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.288
All right, Gary. Right here.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.877
Gimme another one, Shorty.

41:01.961 --> 41:04.005
And a clip.

41:09.343 --> 41:13.180
This is a Mac-10
fully automatic machine pistol.

41:13.306 --> 41:17.476
- You pull this trigger here.
- She ain't got no place here.

41:17.602 --> 41:20.187
- Shut up.
- Here, Gary.

41:20.980 --> 41:23.024
Thanks.

41:23.941 --> 41:27.612
You know what this is. Pop that in.
Here's your magazine release.

41:28.070 --> 41:30.948
Pull this baby back, you got
one up the snout, ready to go.

41:31.324 --> 41:34.785
- You ain't goin' huntin' with that.
- Oh yeah, we are.

41:57.642 --> 41:59.935
Shut up.

42:04.732 --> 42:06.776
Sorry we're late, Shorty.

42:16.327 --> 42:19.330
Cocked and ready. Here y'are, boy.

42:19.455 --> 42:23.042
You'd better start runnin'.
You got ten bullets.

42:23.167 --> 42:26.003
- And 30 seconds.
- You'd better run, nigger.

42:39.767 --> 42:42.853
- We're gonna get some black stuff.
- OK, let's do it.

42:49.652 --> 42:52.154
- Come on.
- No.

42:57.660 --> 43:02.331
I love you. I gotta be honest with you.
You gotta know everything.

43:05.084 --> 43:10.089
It's just training. It's your first hunt.
You'll get used to it. Come on.

43:10.214 --> 43:13.843
All right. Don't stand around
in a cluster fuck. Fan out.

43:17.513 --> 43:19.473
Goddamn it, he shot Duke!

43:20.015 --> 43:23.144
I said spread out over there,
goddamn it. Don't group up.

43:23.269 --> 43:25.312
Get some of them lights out.

43:29.859 --> 43:32.528
Goddamn him to fuckin' hell! He shot Duke!

43:32.653 --> 43:35.156
OK, get up, Buster. Come on.

43:35.281 --> 43:37.783
Move it, Buster!

43:39.869 --> 43:42.830
I'm gonna kill that fuckin' nigger.

43:47.334 --> 43:51.714
- Hey, Shorty, it's Bambi!
- Don't shoot at it!

43:52.256 --> 43:54.717
Come on, goddamn it. Don't group up!

43:54.842 --> 43:56.969
Come on. Put some of them lights out.

43:58.512 --> 44:00.848
Gary! He's over here!

44:08.856 --> 44:10.900
You bastard, I'll kill you!

44:11.650 --> 44:13.694
You bastard!

44:14.904 --> 44:17.156
He's got six left!

44:17.281 --> 44:19.491
Better make it a good one, Satchmo!

44:20.743 --> 44:26.248
Yee-haw! What's the matter?
We're not a big enough target for you?

44:30.461 --> 44:33.380
That's six, nigger. You got four left.

45:03.494 --> 45:05.454
You got two left, boy!

45:07.956 --> 45:11.085
- We're losin' him!
- Goddamn, you missed him!

45:18.884 --> 45:21.637
Come on, lighten up.

45:28.644 --> 45:34.566
- Hey, Gary. Looky here. His gun.
- Oh, this ain't gonna take much longer.

45:44.618 --> 45:48.122
He's wounded. Your fucking game is over.

45:48.247 --> 45:50.916
Shit. Rain. Come on.

46:00.050 --> 46:02.803
Hey, Gary, over here!

46:04.972 --> 46:08.475
Hell, boy, my baby sister
shoots better than you do.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.644
Got us a coon in a trap.

46:16.942 --> 46:19.236
It's your first time, right?

46:19.361 --> 46:21.822
So let her do it.

46:22.072 --> 46:25.117
First one, Katie.
It's your kill. Go get him.

46:25.242 --> 46:27.286
You can do it, Katie.

46:31.248 --> 46:34.543
Walk up there,
point your weapon, pull the trigger.

46:51.643 --> 46:53.437
Don't kill me.

46:58.567 --> 47:01.570
- Don't even think about it, Wes!
- Gary, she knows.

47:01.862 --> 47:05.032
It don't matter! Finish him off!

47:06.875 --> 47:09.244
No!

47:10.662 --> 47:14.166
No!

47:28.096 --> 47:31.141
We'll get you somethin'
to warm you up when we get home.

47:31.266 --> 47:33.727
Just take me to the motel.

47:35.103 --> 47:38.190
Aw, come on, Katie. Come on, now.

47:43.195 --> 47:46.823
It was just a nigger.
There's plenty more where he came from.

47:49.534 --> 47:54.289
I didn't want there to be anything
between us. I love you that much.

47:54.414 --> 47:57.292
If you love me,
I got nothin' to worry about.

47:57.417 --> 48:00.420
But if you don't,
I don't care about goin' to jail.

48:00.545 --> 48:04.132
But one thing's for sure,
we're gonna kick the hell outta Zog.

48:04.257 --> 48:06.301
Who's Zog?

48:07.177 --> 48:09.846
Zionist Occupation Government.

48:09.971 --> 48:14.893
It means the goddamn Jews are runnin'
our country with their nigger police.

49:31.094 --> 49:32.053
Michael.

49:56.786 --> 49:59.372
Where the fuck are you goin', sugar?

50:00.239 --> 50:01.233
Hey!

50:11.051 --> 50:13.053
Cunt!

50:28.610 --> 50:30.695
Oh.

50:30.862 --> 50:33.698
Just hold me. Just hold me real hard.

50:33.823 --> 50:35.617
Oh.

50:35.742 --> 50:37.744
You're sure nobody followed you?

50:45.794 --> 50:48.713
We'll never find the body, Cathy.

50:48.880 --> 50:52.926
I can testify. I was there.
I saw everything.

50:54.010 --> 50:57.263
- I just didn't do anything.
- There wasn't anything you could do.

50:57.430 --> 51:00.016
They're guilty. You're not.

51:00.183 --> 51:04.145
- It wasn't the first hunt they were on.
- No shit.

51:06.398 --> 51:11.403
We'll never find the bodies, Cathy.
I want them for Kraus.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.364
We have a body there.

51:14.531 --> 51:16.783
We can put them away for ever.

51:16.950 --> 51:20.245
- You have to go back in.
- No, I can't go back in.

51:21.079 --> 51:24.290
I need you to link them with Kraus.

51:25.041 --> 51:27.377
You're the only one who can do it.

51:30.004 --> 51:32.215
How could I even look at him again?

51:33.758 --> 51:35.760
How could I let him touch me?

51:37.011 --> 51:39.431
I feel dirty.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.725
I feel so dirty.

51:41.891 --> 51:45.729
I never said you had to
sleep with him, did I?

51:45.895 --> 51:48.022
Did I?

51:48.940 --> 51:50.942
How could you have?

51:54.279 --> 51:56.072
I thought...

51:56.239 --> 51:58.241
Why?!

51:59.075 --> 52:03.371
I didn't sleep with him.
I made love to him.

52:03.538 --> 52:07.250
- What the hell difference does it make?!
- Take it easy, Mike.

52:08.877 --> 52:13.339
Look, I'm in too deep, Michael.
Maybe my loyalties are all screwed up.

52:13.506 --> 52:16.050
I'm off balance.

52:17.302 --> 52:20.221
That would be a convenient excuse
for you, wouldn't it?

52:20.388 --> 52:23.892
You have to go back in.

52:26.853 --> 52:29.272
You just want me
to go back in to punish me.

52:29.939 --> 52:32.025
No.

52:32.192 --> 52:35.653
You feel dirty? What's more important?
Putting them behind bars?

52:35.820 --> 52:38.364
How many others
do you think they're gonna kill?

52:38.531 --> 52:42.827
And how dirty do you think you'd feel
if you didn't do anything about it?

52:43.912 --> 52:47.665
I just don't know
how I could have been so wrong.

52:47.832 --> 52:49.834
How I let him...

52:51.586 --> 52:53.588
If you could see him with his family.

52:53.755 --> 52:59.093
Yeah, well, I don't know. I guess your gut
instinct's just really not that good, right?

53:00.178 --> 53:02.180
Now you know.

53:04.390 --> 53:08.353
Don't go along too easily. Make their
garbage look new to you. Play it normal.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.813
Don't be too quick to convert.

53:10.939 --> 53:14.400
You don't want him to think
that you're an easy lay, do you?

53:14.525 --> 53:19.572
About Wes. Wesley John Bond, paroled
from San Quentin three years ago.

53:19.697 --> 53:23.326
He headed up a racist group
called the Aryan Brotherhood in the joint.

53:23.451 --> 53:26.829
He has a sheet going back 15 years,
all of it in California.

53:26.955 --> 53:29.332
Forcible rape, sodomy, aggravated assault.

53:29.499 --> 53:32.001
And he tried to be
a mercenary in South Africa.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.504
Yeah, I just wish I knew
how he wound up here.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.839
- Shit floats.
- Well, stay away from Wes.

53:37.006 --> 53:40.051
He's a freak's freak,
and Gary's using him.

53:40.468 --> 53:43.429
We've got nothing on the others.
They seem like losers.

53:43.554 --> 53:47.517
You know, if I was Gary,
I'd like losers. I bet Gary likes losers.

53:47.642 --> 53:51.396
Treat losers right, they make
good soldiers. I learned it in the Marines.

53:51.521 --> 53:53.564
I learned it in the FBI.

53:56.025 --> 53:59.278
- Take it.
- If he finds it, I'm dead.

53:59.404 --> 54:01.447
Make sure he doesn't find it.

54:04.033 --> 54:06.619
You're just doing a job. That's all it is.

54:13.626 --> 54:15.670
- Hey, Theresa.
- Hello, Katie.

54:27.807 --> 54:31.477
Mornin'. Where you been?

54:31.602 --> 54:35.231
I drove. I went past the Interstate.

54:36.983 --> 54:39.027
I came back.

54:41.738 --> 54:44.240
Did you come back for your stuff?

54:44.365 --> 54:46.534
It's over there.

54:50.663 --> 54:52.665
No.

54:57.378 --> 55:01.215
Katie, you come back cos you love me?

55:02.675 --> 55:05.178
Cos if you do, I need to know.

55:08.181 --> 55:10.224
Say it.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.562
Please say it.

55:20.693 --> 55:22.737
I love you.

56:22.213 --> 56:24.257
Combines are leavin'.

56:28.386 --> 56:31.305
So? You're stayin'.

56:34.809 --> 56:37.478
Well, I guess it's sad
to see your friends leavin'.

56:37.937 --> 56:40.773
You got a place now.

56:41.482 --> 56:43.901
What'd you kill him for?

56:44.026 --> 56:46.779
Just for the fun of it?

56:46.904 --> 56:49.198
It ain't fun killin' anything.

56:49.323 --> 56:51.367
It was self-defence.

56:51.492 --> 56:54.287
He had a gun.
We were protectin' ourselves.

56:54.412 --> 56:59.417
All we're tryin' to do is
protect ourselves. Self-defence.

56:59.542 --> 57:01.627
I don't like killin' anybody.

57:02.545 --> 57:08.134
- I don't like people hurt.
- They ain't people. They're mud people.

57:12.013 --> 57:16.267
You know, with you helpin'
with the farm and the kids,

57:16.392 --> 57:19.228
I think we got a chance
at a real family again.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.626
Well, there's plenty of space.

57:42.752 --> 57:47.256
And, Katie, there's a closet here
ain't got nothin' in it.

57:47.381 --> 57:50.426
I only got the one suitcase, Gary.

57:50.551 --> 57:52.595
Oh, yeah.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.847
Uh...

57:54.972 --> 57:58.434
I changed this around after my wife died.

57:58.559 --> 58:00.603
Ain't been anybody here since.

58:01.729 --> 58:04.565
Anyway, I want you
to feel like it's home, OK?

58:05.733 --> 58:08.778
Hey, guys. Katie's gonna be
stayin' with us from now on.

58:08.903 --> 58:11.572
- Are you gonna be our mommy?
- Mom's dead.

58:11.697 --> 58:14.325
I don't care.
I don't hardly even remember her.

58:14.450 --> 58:17.328
- I do.
- Rachel! Joey!

58:17.453 --> 58:19.497
Uh, comin', Mom!

58:21.290 --> 58:24.251
- Katie's gonna move in.
- Is she?

58:28.714 --> 58:31.258
Can you talk to her?
Smooth it over? Just be nice.

58:31.383 --> 58:33.427
Just be nice, OK?

58:39.016 --> 58:41.685
Can I help you in the kitchen,
Mrs Simmons?

58:43.062 --> 58:46.273
He's been hurt once.
I don't want him hurt again.

58:48.734 --> 58:51.111
I'm not gonna hurt him.

58:51.237 --> 58:53.906
Will you cut this shit? You been drinkin'?

58:58.827 --> 59:01.789
We'll wait another day and see.

59:01.914 --> 59:05.960
This ain't your business. It's mine.

59:06.627 --> 59:09.588
Katie. Katie?

59:09.713 --> 59:12.258
Rachel?

59:12.383 --> 59:15.219
Aren't you gonna give me
a good-night kiss?

59:15.344 --> 59:17.846
All right. In a minute. You go upstairs.

59:23.352 --> 59:26.272
- I'll give you a hand.
- Well, I'm almost done.

59:26.939 --> 59:31.735
"Wash and dry together, laugh and cry
together." My mama always says that.

59:34.071 --> 59:36.490
What was that all about?

59:36.615 --> 59:39.034
- What?
- With Wes.

59:39.702 --> 59:41.996
Oh.

59:42.121 --> 59:45.249
Well, it seems old Wes thinks
you're a grasshopper.

59:46.458 --> 59:49.670
Grasshopper? He is weird.
Do I look like a grasshopper?

59:49.795 --> 59:54.842
No, no, no. The kinda grasshopper
that's gettin' in people's hair all the time.

59:54.967 --> 59:57.261
Like the FBI, CIA.

59:57.386 --> 01:00:01.473
KGB, JDL, NAACP... that kinda grasshopper.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:07.021
- I'm a what?
- So, are you a grasshopper?

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:11.066
Shit, yeah.

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:14.445
I'm gonna go kiss the kids good night.

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:20.576
Get in. Come on.

01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:24.330
Good night, Rachel. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.832
Good night, Katie.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:30.169
Daddy said we don't have to
have no secrets no more.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:33.964
- What secrets?
- About the niggers and the rabbis.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:38.302
- And the race traitors.
- And Zog. They're the sons of Cain.

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:42.806
Rachel, do you know what a rabbi is?

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:45.017
- You know.
- He's got a big, dirty beard.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:48.270
- With lice in it.
- And he does it to little kids.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:52.232
Niggers do it too.
They do it in the back, in the butt.

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:54.401
That's gross.

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:59.698
We're the good guys. One day, we'll
kill all the dirty niggers and the Jews,

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.868
and everything's gonna be neat.

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:06.622
Do you know what a cow kiss is?

01:01:17.508 --> 01:01:19.551
Turn out your light, Joey.

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:28.977
Will do. Will do.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.941
- You done already?
- Um, I was just watching you.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.612
Well, come on, I'll show you.

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:50.541
- You know anything about computers?
- No. Just games and stuff like that.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:55.796
Yeah. Well, I can talk to anybody I want.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.800
We have systems operators
all over the country.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:06.306
Welcome to the American Liberty Network.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:09.142
- Oh, wow.
- It talks too.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:19.903
Neat, huh?

01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:41.842
My dad, when I was a kid, told me

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:45.554
"No amount of carrying on
is gonna make the wheat grow faster."

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:49.391
"Don't rock the boat."
He changed his mind later on.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:54.146
We're gonna rock this goddamn boat.

Thank you.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.880

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.175

- Yeah.

01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:11.139
Well, check it once in a while.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:15.185
- I thought we were goin' campin'.
- We are.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:00.021
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi, Gary.

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:04.067
- I gotta get these kids fed.
- Toby made a big pot of stew.

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:07.487
- Great, Ellie. Go to the table.
- Hi. Hi, Katie.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.285
You guys eat
and hurry up and get to sleep.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:16.204
- Can't I stay up a little?
- No, you cannot stay up.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.999
Goddamn, that's good beef stew, Toby.

I'll be along, Wes.

01:05:44.149 --> 01:05:48.236
- Hey, Shorty. Where's Gary?
- Oh, he'll be back in a minute.

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.905
Come on out here.
Sit down and warm your toes.

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:53.074
Gets kinda nippy up here.

01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:57.787
- I just got the kids to sleep.
- You're real good with them.

01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.956
They're nice kids.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:06.921
- Where'd everybody go, anyway?
- Oh, visitin' friends, puttin' kids to bed.

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:09.507
I'm kinda the old watchdog here.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.016
How do you feel about this?

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.647
It's all kinda new to me, you know?

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:30.403
I never really known
any Jews or niggers before.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:34.074
- I don't like hurtin' people.
- Well, I don't either.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:36.242
I don't even like seein' a fight.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:41.790
But, if we don't fight back, they'll take it
all away from us, the whole country.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.042
Jew-boy judges, and bankers,

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:48.922
and politicians with
their nigger police, and Orientals.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:53.426
- All of these people with guns.
- I know. I don't like it either.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:57.639
Hell, I have to close my eyes
every time I pull the trigger.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.976
You got a good heart, Katie.
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:05.730
But you learn. You gotta do
what's gotta be done.

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.526
I learned too.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:16.324
All I ever wanted was just to
raise my crops and raise my boy.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:22.122
The bank took my farm
and Vietnam took my son.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.084
I got nothin' left to take.

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:34.592
I ain't in this for myself, either.
I got a good heart too, Katie, just like you.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:52.610
- What are you doin' up?
- I can't sleep. I got the hiccups.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.279
You do?

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.406
Boo!

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.783
I'll lay down with you.
Good night, Shorty.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.744

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:23.725
- Oh, it's nice here.
- Yeah. I bet you're hungry, too.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.894
- Yeah.
- Well, we got breakfast.

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:31.733
Bob Daniels, Chattanooga,
you're wanted at the registration desk.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:34.611
Hey, Lyle!

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:38.031
Have a nice day, Lyle!

01:08:38.156 --> 01:08:41.390
I done told you not to say that to me!
I done told you.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:47.790
Lyle thinks "Have a nice day"
is a Jewish plot to put us all to sleep.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:51.627
- Can we play ball now, Dad?
- What are you doin'? You got school.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.881
- Wes, help me out.
- Let's go, you monkeys! School time.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:57.050
Go, go.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:01.179
How sweet.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:04.890
There they are, over there.

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:07.100
- This is school?
- Yeah.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.612
- Very good.
- How's she doin'?

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:22.325
She's doin' great, Gary.
She's a better shot than you are.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:29.122
Isn't that great? This scratches.
This doesn't feel good.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.667
No, it doesn't, does it?

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.587
- Freeze!
- Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:37.965
- Freeze!
- Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.009
Freeze! Target!

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.053
Shoot!

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.767
Pay attention to the target.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.939
Site it. Just a little bit below the target.
Take a deep breath.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:01.781
Oh, Jesus, Katie.
What'd you do? Close your eyes?

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:04.659
- I guess so.
- Concentrate.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:07.912
Get that Jew-boy right in the eye.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.380
Holy shit.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.176
- Beginner's luck.
- You was connin' me.

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:29.058
Hey, Gary! Gary, we got Lugers.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:33.271
- Look at this.
- This boy's got original Lugers for sale.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:37.024
- Get outta here.
- What did you say, brother?

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:41.737
My dad got a Purple Heart fightin'
uniforms like that and your Adolf Hitler.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.282
I don't wanna hear about it.
Get outta here.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:46.492
Go jack off with your Lugers.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:53.666
- Oh, Jesus.
- What'd you do that for?

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:58.337
Because they're assholes and they're
losers. You're an asshole too, Lyle.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:01.340
We got more assholes here
than they got in California.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:04.927
California? He's from Oshkosh,
Wisconsin. That's Johnson.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.096
I put $50 down on that gun.

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:13.269
What the hell'd he mean by that?
Why'd he call me an asshole for?

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:15.521
Beats the shit outta me, Lyle.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:23.112
Hey, Gary. Gary.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.783
The stuff is here. Wake up, man.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.703
OK.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:44.175
Yeah, they wouldn't give it to me, man.
They didn't trust me.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:48.054
- They got what we want?
- They got a whole truckload of shit.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:24.764
- Look out for the bear, Wes.
- Fuck you.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:30.304
Don't worry about them bears.
It's them wolverines.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:34.183
- A wolverine'll kick the piss out of a bear.
- Is that right?

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:42.692
Come on, Wes. It's probably
somebody sneakin' out to take a crap.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:44.860
I heard somethin'.

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:29.238
Gettin' jumpy, Wes?

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:41.292
This old blue-gummed nigger
gets to heaven. St Pete's there.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.711
Yeah, sure, Shorty. I gotta go.

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:53.387
I saw you.

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.556
I saw you, cunt.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:03.314
- What the fuck...
- She was out in the woods, Gary.

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:07.109
- What the fuck you doin'?
- She was out in the fuckin' woods.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:10.196
I've been sittin' by this fire all night.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:15.075
- You touch her, I'll kill you.
- I tell you, she was out there.

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:21.624
Go get Dean and Buster.
We gotta talk. In your tent.

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:33.260
- Where?
- New York, San Francisco, LA,

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:36.639
- Miami, Chicago, Atlanta.
- When?

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:40.017
- Three days after the hit.
- When's the hit?

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.894
I'll let you know.

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:56.116
No, you cannot have another rock.
That's it with the rocks.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.994
Good morning, everybody.

01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:03.540
My name's Jack Carpenter and
I'd like to be your man in Washington.

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:09.922
We're running a campaign here
to return America to real Americans.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:14.134
- Hey, isn't that your friend?
- So let's get organised.

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:22.476
Unless you want the Jews, niggers and
faggots to keep on telling you what to do.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.604
Course, you know
it's gonna take some financin'.

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:30.192
- God. Look at him.
- We got some donation pledge cards.

01:15:30.317 --> 01:15:33.153
You can sign and put it
on your credit card.

01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:36.573
Don't give me anything,
unless you can afford it.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:39.159
- I mean that, now.
- No, you don't.

01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:44.289
You don't care if they
can afford it or not.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:47.459
All you care about is
buyin' yourself another Cadillac.

01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:51.213
- Or maybe a new fancy suit.
- Who are you, mister?

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:55.008
- Whose side are you on?
- Come on, now, Gary.

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:59.054
- We're all on the same side here.
- I ain't on his side.

01:15:59.179 --> 01:16:01.890
You think you're gonna win, Mr Big Shot?

01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:06.103
You ain't got a prayer, pal.
You're just in it for the ride.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.564
Well, you ain't ridin' on my back.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:11.358
All you're doin'
is distractin' people here.

01:16:11.483 --> 01:16:15.362
- Maybe that's what you wanna do.
- I'll talk to him.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:20.617
A boy with your speakin' talents, maybe
you oughta be runnin' instead of me.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.996
I ain't real sure which one of us
is the politician, friend.

01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:28.917
- Fuck you.
- You gotta clean up your speakin' style.

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:34.631
Jesus Christ, Bobby. You had to go
and hitch your wagon to him?

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:38.469
What the fuck did you do that for,
Bobby? Why, man? Why?

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.888
What did I keep tellin' you back in Nam?

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:44.391
I said you're the best point man
I ever saw, but stick to that.

01:16:44.516 --> 01:16:48.312
Don't do nothin' else.
You leave the formations to me.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:51.148
But look at him.
There ain't nothin' inside.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:53.650
And what'll you do
when the shit hits the fan?

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:57.863
When he starts stealin' money
or dickin' some jailbait.

01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:02.017
I'm proud to sign your Bible.
This is our cement!

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:07.706
This is the only constitution
we'll ever need.

01:17:07.831 --> 01:17:09.333
All right!

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:12.753
God, look at him.
He's gonna ruin everything for us.

01:17:13.837 --> 01:17:16.231
Do you think I'd ever let him do that?

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.472
I ain't never gonna let nobody do that.

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:26.183
You hear me, point? You hear me?

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.019
Yeah, I hear you, Bobby. I hear you.

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:34.399
Hey, I'm the best point man
you ever saw, right?

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.737
The war's over now, isn't it, Gary?

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.742
- The fuck it is, Bobby.
- The fuck it is.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:49.456
I know what I'm doin'. I always did
set up a hell of a formation, didn't I?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:52.125
Yeah, you always did, Bobby.

01:17:56.922 --> 01:18:00.467
That's why you should be
head of the whole damn thing.

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:11.979
Carpenter is a straw man. He's not
into murder. He's into upward mobility.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:14.523
Gary's right.

01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:18.819
You're talking New York, LA, Chicago,
San Francisco, Miami and Atlanta?

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:21.279
Three days after the hit.
That's all I heard.

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:25.575
Hit? Hit who? Hit what?
What the hell's goin' on, huh?

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:30.080
Hits, mortars, submachine guns, enough
of 'em to outfit a goddamn division.

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:32.833
And still nothing about Kraus?

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:36.294
What do you want me to do?
Walk up and ask him if he killed Kraus?

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.547
Nobody wants you to do that.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:43.176
Hell, yes, they killed Kraus.
That's how we get 'em.

01:18:43.301 --> 01:18:48.056
The rest is chickenshit. They'll be off
in a year with good behaviour.

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:50.851
- Wes knows.
- Wes knows what?

01:18:51.643 --> 01:18:54.730
- About me.
- He can't. How could he know?

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.691
Michael, he knows! He's been all over me.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:02.154
He's a nutcake. It's probably
his way of showing affection.

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:05.615
Here. I found these.
They belong to his gun.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.619
Nine millimetre. Mac-10.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:15.709
- She's got to prove herself to them.
- She has. They trust her.

01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:19.504
- Whaddaya want me to do, kill someone?
- Hope you won't have to.

01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:21.757
I didn't join up to kill anyone.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:27.137
Michael, you promised me
that I wouldn't get dirty.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:30.307
You were using me. You're still using me.

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:33.143
You're lettin' me use you.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:36.229
Everybody uses everybody, girl.

01:19:36.354 --> 01:19:39.024
It's just a matter of what
you're being used for.

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:42.611
What it is... is the only important thing.

01:19:42.986 --> 01:19:45.906
Michael, they could be anywhere.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:50.202
We'll find you a safe home, house,
place, whatever. You'll be all right.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.747
Katie's here! Katie's back!

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:56.708
- Where you been all day?
- I went to the mall.

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:58.043
All day?

01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:00.504
I don't have to tell
you how long I'll be gone.

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.298
- Hey, kids, go get some napkins.
- I'll get the beer.

01:20:03.423 --> 01:20:07.260
- You quit crowdin' me.
- You're a fuckin' wildcat, aren't you?

01:20:07.385 --> 01:20:09.471
What were you doin' at the mall all day?

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:12.057
Shoppin'.

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:15.143
Yeah? Anything for me?

01:20:15.268 --> 01:20:17.687
Maybe. Maybe it's a surprise.

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:20.607
- Let me see.
- Look what you did.

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:23.944
- What?
- You put the forks in the wrong place.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.488
Daddy, the forks go on the left side.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:31.243
What are you doin'?

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.204
Where's my surprise?

01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:36.915
Just a minute.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.960
Liaison completed.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.962
Assignments completed.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.724
Liaison completed.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.693
<i>♪ Ta-dah</i>

01:21:09.614 --> 01:21:12.867
You don't have to dress
like a ten-dollar whore for me.

01:21:13.326 --> 01:21:15.328
You look like a whore.

01:21:24.754 --> 01:21:26.923
I'm not a whore.

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:29.342
Then why do you dress like one?

01:21:44.107 --> 01:21:46.109
Katie, I'm sorry.

01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:48.945
It's just that I got
a lot of pressure on me.

01:21:53.116 --> 01:21:55.869
I got a real big job to do next week.

01:22:01.374 --> 01:22:03.877
We'll park the van here on Madison Street.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:06.963
- What about the others?
- We'll meet them at Navy Pier.

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:12.343
And they'll be ready. We go in like
Wild Bill Hickok and stick 'em up.

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:15.180
And maybe we ain't gonna
have to shoot anybody.

01:22:15.346 --> 01:22:17.599
- And what if we do?
- Then we do.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.809
She ain't gonna shoot nobody.

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:23.938
- She will if she has to.
- No, she won't.

01:22:27.358 --> 01:22:30.570
- You scared?
- Why do you want me to go in?

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:35.200
- You got a better eye than I do.
- That ain't the reason.

01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:38.119
Reason enough.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:40.288
I'm gonna go get the kids.

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:45.418
- Mom's gonna bring 'em.
- Well, I'll save her the trouble.

01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:13.863
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Daddy.

01:23:16.574 --> 01:23:19.244
- Who'd you call?
- When?

01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:21.955
Who'd you call on the way to Mom's?

01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:24.499
You followed me? Is that what you did?

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:26.960
Who the fuck did you call?!

01:23:27.126 --> 01:23:29.212
Go on! Get up to your rooms!

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:32.215
I called your mother.
I told her I was comin'.

01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:41.766
Mom? Did Katie call you
before she picked up the kids?

01:23:42.767 --> 01:23:45.520
Yeah, she called and said
for me to get them ready.

01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:48.940
...to investigate presidential
candidate Jack Carpenter

01:23:49.107 --> 01:23:53.236
for alleged misappropriation
of campaign funds.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.238
Thanks, Mom.

01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:59.784
Oh, boy. Yes, I've heard the reports.
No, I'm not concerned.

01:24:00.159 --> 01:24:02.996
I think this shows that some people

01:24:03.162 --> 01:24:06.666
are being made
very nervous by my candidacy.

01:24:15.174 --> 01:24:17.927
What do you need me for?
I should keep the car running.

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:21.431
It's a little late for that crap now.
You're goin'.

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:23.850
- You boys know Chicago?
- I'm from Boston.

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:26.644
- Not me. I'm from Tallahassee.
- Let's go!

01:24:29.105 --> 01:24:31.649
- We know Chicago, don't we, Shorty?
- Sure do.

01:24:44.954 --> 01:24:47.332
- Wesley?
- What's so funny?

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:53.546
Ah, just thinkin'. My great-grandaddy
used to rob stagecoaches.

01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:57.425
No shit? My great-grandaddy
was the town marshal.

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:02.305
My grandfather owned a bank.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.682
I manage a bank myself.

01:25:10.396 --> 01:25:13.024
The wind is startin' to blow.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.445
You're gonna wanna zip that up.

01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:19.864
It's a bulletproof vest.

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:42.929
Good morning! We rob banks!

01:25:43.054 --> 01:25:45.515
- Lay on the ground.
- Get on the floor!

01:25:46.182 --> 01:25:49.393
- Get on the floor! Get over here!
- Listen up!

01:25:49.727 --> 01:25:53.564
- Don't move! Get on the ground!
- You two, get over there!

01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:57.318
You blink your eyes and
I'll blow your goddamn head off!

01:25:57.443 --> 01:25:59.570
We don't want any heroes today!

01:25:59.695 --> 01:26:01.739
I mean that!

01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:39.193
- What happened?
- It's all right.

01:26:43.155 --> 01:26:45.199
Nice shot.

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:52.582
Katie, come on.

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:57.670
Thank you, everybody. Have a nice day!

01:27:22.528 --> 01:27:27.074
Shit. Shut the fuck up!
You call yourself a cop? You fucked...

01:27:27.199 --> 01:27:29.243
Shut up!

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:34.248
When you get on Lake Shore Drive,
hang a left.

01:27:34.373 --> 01:27:36.417
Shut up!

01:27:39.295 --> 01:27:41.339
Take him out.

01:27:41.464 --> 01:27:45.009
Shut the fuck up!
Call yourself a fucking cop?

01:27:50.014 --> 01:27:54.060
- About four blocks!
- All right.

01:27:54.185 --> 01:27:57.938
- Watch your speed.
- I'm goin' slow. Don't worry about it.

01:28:05.863 --> 01:28:07.907
Shut up!

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:18.125
He's dead.

01:28:33.849 --> 01:28:38.395
Katie, come on, let's go. Why don't you
drive home? I'll see you tomorrow.

01:28:46.987 --> 01:28:49.031
Shorty and I will take care of Wes.

01:28:49.156 --> 01:28:51.200
You did real good.

01:28:54.161 --> 01:28:59.041
I don't understand. There was only
supposed to be three guards in that bank.

01:29:05.172 --> 01:29:09.635
- Michael, I... I shot a guard.
- He was gonna kill you.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.513
- It was self-defence.
- He was an innocent.

01:29:12.638 --> 01:29:17.268
He was caught in a crossfire.
We didn't know he'd be there. I'm sorry.

01:29:17.393 --> 01:29:19.687
You're sorry? Where were you?

01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:23.566
- We decided to let it happen.
- Great, without telling me.

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:26.777
We couldn't contact you.
We don't want 'em for bank robbery.

01:29:26.902 --> 01:29:30.197
We wanna know how they'll use
the money. They netted 3.2 million

01:29:30.322 --> 01:29:32.408
on four bank heists across the country.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:36.036
They're buildin' some kind of a war chest.

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.833
- And what about Wes?
- What about him?

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:44.295
You said he was onto ya.
I took him out. Didn't wanna risk it.

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.755
Oh, you did it for me.

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:50.301
Yes, I did it for you.
And the world's a better place.

01:29:50.426 --> 01:29:53.053
Look, Michael. Just forget it.

01:29:53.178 --> 01:29:55.222
I've had it.

01:29:58.267 --> 01:30:01.312
You've had enough, huh?
That's it. Another job half done.

01:30:01.437 --> 01:30:05.900
Kinda like the décor here, your stint
with the Peace Corps, our relationship.

01:30:06.025 --> 01:30:11.155
- You never cared about us.
- I care a great deal about you, Cathy.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.574
- No, you don't.
- You ended us, not me.

01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:16.160
That was self-defence.

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.248
The guard's OK. He's out of danger.

01:30:21.373 --> 01:30:24.543
She's troubled about killing old Wes.

01:30:25.085 --> 01:30:28.464
How do you feel about
droppin' that piece of shit, Al?

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.717
Terrific.

01:30:31.842 --> 01:30:35.054
Like cleaning something off my shoe.

01:30:44.271 --> 01:30:46.315
Katie!

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.236
Katie!

01:30:51.362 --> 01:30:54.239
I missed you. I didn't think
you were ever coming back.

01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:57.326
I always think about you, Rachel.
I love you.

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:59.953
- A whole big bunch?
- A whole big bunch.

01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:06.168
- Are you all alone?
- Joey's in his room.

01:31:06.293 --> 01:31:08.337
Rachel...

01:31:09.546 --> 01:31:12.674
Remember you said
we didn't have to have secrets any more?

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.137
Yeah, and I told you about the Jews
and the niggers and the sons of Cain.

01:31:17.262 --> 01:31:20.391
Do you still think it's right
to hurt other people?

01:31:22.601 --> 01:31:26.271
What about all those little girls
whose daddies have black skin?

01:31:26.397 --> 01:31:30.275
Don't you think they love their daddies
just as much as you do?

01:31:31.276 --> 01:31:35.030
In America we can do anything we want,
except hurt other people.

01:31:35.155 --> 01:31:39.076
- Can I tell Daddy?
- No, this'll be our secret.

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:41.787
Best friends always have secrets.

01:31:41.912 --> 01:31:46.750
- I don't have a best friend.
- Neither do I. And I need one.

01:31:46.875 --> 01:31:48.919
- Me too.
- Do you know what a cow kiss is?

01:31:49.044 --> 01:31:51.130
I showed you what it was.

01:31:56.593 --> 01:31:59.555
Daddy's here. You don't need me any more.

01:32:08.147 --> 01:32:10.190
Hi.

01:32:12.609 --> 01:32:15.362
Oh, I know it's rough the first time.

01:32:15.487 --> 01:32:18.157
I know that.

01:32:18.282 --> 01:32:21.910
But, Katie, whew,
you were so relaxed when... bam!

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.913
- Girl, you got the instinct.
- No!

01:32:25.038 --> 01:32:28.542
- Yeah, you do. I know you.
- No, I don't. What did we do it for?

01:32:28.667 --> 01:32:30.752
- What?
- What did we rob a bank for?

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:33.630
What did Wes die for?
What did I shoot somebody for?

01:32:33.755 --> 01:32:36.466
You're upset.
I understand that. OK, listen.

01:32:36.592 --> 01:32:38.635
You tell me.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.804
Who's that money for?

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:44.850
Friends of ours.

01:32:44.975 --> 01:32:47.019
What friends?

01:32:50.063 --> 01:32:52.107
Friends.

01:32:54.026 --> 01:32:57.613
<i>♪ The devil's right hand,
The devil's right hand</i>

01:32:57.738 --> 01:33:01.825
<i>♪ My mama said the pistol
was the devil's right hand</i>

01:33:02.868 --> 01:33:05.579
- No smooching.
- That's gross.

01:33:08.957 --> 01:33:13.003
I love this place. You know,
it could be so good again for them.

01:33:13.128 --> 01:33:15.631
Like it was for me
when I was a little kid.

01:33:16.381 --> 01:33:20.552
We're gonna make it good
for 'em again, ain't we, Katie? Ain't we?

01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.388
- Huh?
- Yeah, Gary.

01:33:23.555 --> 01:33:26.892
Yeah. Oh, yes, we are.

01:33:28.644 --> 01:33:30.687
Marry me.

01:33:32.731 --> 01:33:34.733
Will you marry me?

01:33:36.151 --> 01:33:38.695
Ah, you don't have to answer me right now.

01:33:47.954 --> 01:33:51.541
That's the power plant there.
They got three guards, 24 hours a day.

01:33:51.708 --> 01:33:56.004
Our boys back East will knock that out.
Kill all the lights in Jew York City.

01:33:56.171 --> 01:33:58.423
What the hell's that gonna prove?

01:33:58.590 --> 01:34:00.592
They got ten guys dressed as cops

01:34:00.759 --> 01:34:04.221
who are gonna go into Harlem
and shoot the niggers.

01:34:04.471 --> 01:34:08.266
Hot damn. That's what
I'm gonna do. That is fun.

01:34:08.558 --> 01:34:12.187
- What do you wanna do, Dean?
- I wanna go to Harlem.

01:34:12.354 --> 01:34:16.233
Niggers are gonna riot.
They think this country's theirs.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.694
But we're gonna show 'em it ain't.

01:34:20.404 --> 01:34:24.616
In San Francisco, we're gonna kill
some faggots. And in Chicago...

01:34:24.866 --> 01:34:27.369
Sickago,

01:34:27.536 --> 01:34:31.832
we're gonna put four loads
of dynamite in the courthouse.

01:34:31.957 --> 01:34:33.583
Mother of shit!

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:37.295
This country ain't gonna know
what the fuck happened.

01:34:37.462 --> 01:34:40.132
- What about the hit?
- We do that three days before.

01:34:40.298 --> 01:34:43.593
- That's what sets it off.
- Who's the target?

01:34:46.138 --> 01:34:48.140
Who's gonna do it, Gary?

01:34:50.267 --> 01:34:52.060
Me and you.

01:34:56.106 --> 01:34:59.359
- I went for a drive.
- I didn't ask where you'd been.

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:03.697
Yes.

01:35:05.073 --> 01:35:07.075
Yes?

01:35:10.203 --> 01:35:12.205
Yes?

01:35:12.664 --> 01:35:14.875
Yes? Whoo!

01:35:16.293 --> 01:35:18.295
Come on, let's call Mom.

01:35:21.381 --> 01:35:23.758
- What's her number?
- My mom?

01:35:23.925 --> 01:35:26.678
- Yeah.
- 214...

01:35:27.721 --> 01:35:31.641
817-1701.

01:35:38.231 --> 01:35:41.151
Mrs Phillips? Yeah. Hold on, please.

01:35:41.318 --> 01:35:44.613
Hi, Mom? I'm gettin' married.

01:35:44.779 --> 01:35:47.949
No, I'm not kiddin'.

01:35:48.116 --> 01:35:50.952
- No, it's... it's true. Yeah.
- Gimme that.

01:35:51.119 --> 01:35:53.121
- Mrs Phillips?
- Call her Emma.

01:35:53.288 --> 01:35:59.127
Uh, Emma. Yeah. Hi. I'm Gary Simmons.
And I'm the lucky guy.

01:36:03.089 --> 01:36:06.009
Well, when are we gonna do it, Katie?

01:36:06.134 --> 01:36:08.637
Do what?

01:36:08.803 --> 01:36:10.972
Do what? When are we gonna get married?!

01:36:11.139 --> 01:36:15.602
- Shh. The kids are sleeping.
- Oh, they're OK. How about tomorrow?

01:36:16.811 --> 01:36:19.648
Well, I gotta wait
till my mama gets better.

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:23.735
Aw, the hell with your mama.
I wanna get married now.

01:36:23.902 --> 01:36:28.657
- What about that thing we gotta do?
- Oh. Well, there ain't nothin' to that.

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:30.909
It's so easy.

01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:34.579
You wanna see how easy it is?
I'll show you how easy it is.

01:36:56.893 --> 01:36:59.187
All these names?

01:36:59.312 --> 01:37:01.356
Look at 'em.

01:37:04.442 --> 01:37:06.778
They're all friends of ours.

01:37:06.903 --> 01:37:11.449
High-up friends, low-down friends,
all helpin' us, lookin' out for us.

01:37:11.574 --> 01:37:14.703
We can hit a thousand people
and it ain't nothin'.

01:37:21.126 --> 01:37:23.420
- Hey, what are you gonna wear?
- What?

01:37:23.545 --> 01:37:27.382
Come on, Katie, what kinda
wedding dress are you gonna wear?

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.011
Marry in blue, your guy'll be true.

01:37:32.137 --> 01:37:36.516
- Marry in brown, you'll live in town.
- Marry in green, ashamed to be seen.

01:37:36.641 --> 01:37:39.227
Marry in yellow, you got the right fellow.

01:37:39.352 --> 01:37:41.896
Marry in grey, be sad someday.

01:37:43.106 --> 01:37:46.025
Marry in white, it'll be all right.

01:37:51.948 --> 01:37:54.325
You're so pretty.

01:37:54.451 --> 01:37:56.828
You smell like a horse.

01:38:04.377 --> 01:38:07.338
You're never gonna
turn against me, are you?

01:38:07.464 --> 01:38:09.507
No.

01:38:14.053 --> 01:38:16.097
She couldn't go along with me.

01:38:18.099 --> 01:38:20.852
She got pregnant.

01:38:20.977 --> 01:38:23.021
Had an abortion.

01:38:26.024 --> 01:38:28.443
She killed my baby.

01:38:28.568 --> 01:38:31.696
She said she'd rather kill it than...

01:38:39.245 --> 01:38:41.623
She tried to turn the kids against me.

01:38:43.791 --> 01:38:45.835
She ran away from me.

01:38:46.502 --> 01:38:49.255
Writin' them and callin' them
behind my back.

01:38:55.595 --> 01:38:59.849
I had to share my life with you.
All of it.

01:38:59.974 --> 01:39:02.227
I couldn't go through all that again.

01:39:02.352 --> 01:39:04.938
You gotta be with me
every step of the way.

01:39:07.899 --> 01:39:09.943
I didn't have no choice with her.

01:39:12.028 --> 01:39:14.906
Who killed her?

01:39:17.367 --> 01:39:19.410
Wes.

01:39:20.745 --> 01:39:23.164
I'm all alone in there.
Can I sleep in here?

01:39:23.289 --> 01:39:25.750
Oh, Rachel, not again.

01:40:23.766 --> 01:40:25.768
Michael?

01:40:43.035 --> 01:40:45.538
Where have you been?
I've been here two hours.

01:40:45.663 --> 01:40:49.375
- We got held up.
- You don't get held up! This is my life!

01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:03.765
What do we have, Cathy?

01:41:05.183 --> 01:41:10.646
So we got some photos of Kraus
with a black X mark over his face?

01:41:10.771 --> 01:41:13.274
What does that prove?

01:41:13.399 --> 01:41:17.320
If we bust them for the bank robbery,
what about these people?

01:41:18.362 --> 01:41:20.656
Somebody else'll pull the trigger.

01:41:23.451 --> 01:41:25.661
We're almost there.

01:41:25.786 --> 01:41:27.830
All we need is the name.

01:41:29.248 --> 01:41:31.292
Ted Kennedy, Jesse Jackson,

01:41:31.417 --> 01:41:35.213
Coleman Young,
Howard Metzenbaum, Kissinger.

01:41:35.338 --> 01:41:40.468
Myroff. Myroff is an investigative
reporter from Louisville.

01:41:40.593 --> 01:41:44.305
Terry Sheridan. Terry Sheridan is
a linebacker for the Miami Dolphins.

01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:47.892
We can't possibly protect
these people for God knows how long.

01:41:48.017 --> 01:41:51.812
What are they supposed to do?
Crawl into a room and stay there?

01:41:51.938 --> 01:41:55.608
We need the name.
Or the time and the place.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.403
We'll monitor their schedule.

01:42:00.696 --> 01:42:02.740
Then it's over.

01:42:05.868 --> 01:42:08.120
I can't stand it any more.

01:42:18.130 --> 01:42:20.299
I wish I could do it instead of you.

01:42:23.052 --> 01:42:25.638
I'd give anything
if I could do it for you.

01:42:27.807 --> 01:42:29.850
You know that, don't you?

01:42:31.978 --> 01:42:34.021
You do, don't you?

01:42:35.731 --> 01:42:39.568
I'd better take this stuff back
before he notices it's gone.

01:42:43.656 --> 01:42:45.700
Gary?

01:42:56.711 --> 01:42:58.671
Hi.

01:42:58.796 --> 01:43:00.840
You look funny.

01:43:01.507 --> 01:43:05.177
- How was your doctor visit?
- Fine. Everything's fine.

01:43:05.302 --> 01:43:07.722
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, they're at Mom's.

01:43:07.847 --> 01:43:11.767
- We gotta go out, so I gotta get ready.
- Oh. Where are we goin'?

01:43:11.892 --> 01:43:14.270
- Get me a beer, will ya?
- Yeah.

01:43:19.859 --> 01:43:21.986
Where are we goin'?

01:43:22.111 --> 01:43:24.155
Just over here.

01:43:29.285 --> 01:43:30.703
Relax.

01:43:41.797 --> 01:43:44.300
- What are we doing here?
- Waitin'.

01:43:55.519 --> 01:43:57.855
He's here.

01:43:58.856 --> 01:44:00.900
You stay here.

01:44:23.923 --> 01:44:26.091
I brought somethin' for ya.

01:45:10.636 --> 01:45:14.557
You've got point, Gar.
We're gonna win this war.

01:45:20.062 --> 01:45:22.106
OK, Bobby.

01:45:22.398 --> 01:45:24.441
I brought you somethin' else.

01:45:27.778 --> 01:45:29.863
It's your hit, point.

01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:32.199
And everything you need is inside.

01:45:58.934 --> 01:46:00.936
Who was that?

01:46:02.062 --> 01:46:04.064
The Lone Ranger.

01:46:05.983 --> 01:46:08.444
The Lone Ranger rides again.

01:46:13.532 --> 01:46:16.201
Why won't you tell me?

01:46:16.326 --> 01:46:18.328
Who's crowdin' who now?

01:46:24.334 --> 01:46:27.004
We go to Denver tomorrow.

01:46:27.421 --> 01:46:30.007
- Why?
- You know why.

01:46:47.816 --> 01:46:49.818
What's the matter with you?

01:46:52.488 --> 01:46:54.490
Nothin'. I'm just tired.

01:47:05.959 --> 01:47:07.503
Good night.

01:47:08.921 --> 01:47:10.923
I love you, Katie.

01:48:03.934 --> 01:48:05.936
- Denver. Tomorrow.
- Are you sure?

01:48:06.103 --> 01:48:10.482
Yes. If I disappear now,
he'll stop everything.

01:48:10.607 --> 01:48:12.347
I have to go through with it.

01:48:15.654 --> 01:48:17.656
All right.

01:49:26.099 --> 01:49:28.143
You all right, Gary?

01:49:29.227 --> 01:49:33.899
I gotta check on the fires. You want me to
start plantin' now or wait till you're back?

01:49:34.024 --> 01:49:36.526
Uh, I don't know, Shorty. Wait, I guess.

01:49:37.235 --> 01:49:39.321
- Come on, Katie.
- Bye, Rachel.

01:49:39.446 --> 01:49:42.824
- Why do you always have to be leaving?
- Yeah, but I'll come back.

01:49:42.949 --> 01:49:46.244
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I love you, Rachel.

01:49:46.369 --> 01:49:49.498
- A whole big bunch?
- A whole big bunch.

01:49:49.623 --> 01:49:51.666
You be a good girl, OK?

01:49:52.542 --> 01:49:54.961
Gladys.

01:50:20.612 --> 01:50:23.073
Why don't you put on some rock'n'roll?

01:50:24.032 --> 01:50:26.326
You don't like rock'n'roll.

01:50:26.451 --> 01:50:28.870
I know, but you do.

01:50:46.805 --> 01:50:49.224
I thought we were going to Denver.

01:50:49.349 --> 01:50:51.810
Oh... I changed my mind.

01:51:01.695 --> 01:51:04.281
I wanna get somethin' to eat. Can we stop?

01:51:15.125 --> 01:51:17.377
Made these myself.

01:51:24.342 --> 01:51:26.803
Come on, I thought you were hungry.

01:51:26.928 --> 01:51:28.972
Oh, I am.

01:51:34.769 --> 01:51:37.689
Look, I really have to go to the bathroom.

01:51:37.814 --> 01:51:39.858
Go to the bathroom, too?

01:51:41.401 --> 01:51:44.362
- Well, I guess we gotta stop, don't we?
- Yeah.

01:52:23.151 --> 01:52:25.779
Katie. Katie, it's me.

01:52:27.238 --> 01:52:30.867
- Yeah?
- Sorry, uh, that men's room don't work.

01:52:30.992 --> 01:52:34.746
You don't mind, do you? Good. Excuse me.

01:52:37.290 --> 01:52:42.087
Oh, stand guard there and keep
an eye out. I don't wanna get caught. OK?

01:52:48.343 --> 01:52:50.929
Some pinhead spelled "hell" with one L.

01:53:00.522 --> 01:53:02.273
Sickago.

01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:45.108
Oh, we got some time.

01:53:46.651 --> 01:53:48.695
You want another sandwich?

01:54:18.808 --> 01:54:21.603
Relax, Katie.

01:54:35.033 --> 01:54:37.493
You nervous, Catherine?

01:54:39.370 --> 01:54:41.831
And your name ain't Phillips, either.

01:54:42.999 --> 01:54:45.043
It's Weaver.

01:54:46.085 --> 01:54:50.465
Your mom ain't sick.
You don't have any folks.

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:56.054
They were killed in a car crash
when you were a kid.

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:04.604
You're under arrest.

01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:07.774
Put it down, Gary.

01:55:10.943 --> 01:55:12.362
Please.

01:55:17.659 --> 01:55:20.953
What'd you bring me
up here for if you knew?

01:55:23.956 --> 01:55:27.543
I wanted 'em to find
a dead FBI agent shooter.

01:55:31.714 --> 01:55:34.092
Boy, ain't that rich?

01:55:35.218 --> 01:55:37.011
Put it down, please.

01:55:37.345 --> 01:55:39.555
You were their whore all along.

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:43.684
No. In the beginning
I was falling in love with you.

01:55:45.228 --> 01:55:47.814
You laid down with me
to get what they wanted.

01:55:47.939 --> 01:55:51.109
I didn't think there was anything to get.

01:55:51.234 --> 01:55:53.444
Put it down.

01:55:54.570 --> 01:55:56.614
What for?

01:55:58.199 --> 01:56:00.243
What the hell for?

01:56:15.383 --> 01:56:18.469
- You gonna shoot me?
- Don't. Please.

01:56:21.472 --> 01:56:23.641
Oh, God! I loved you, Katie.

01:56:27.645 --> 01:56:29.313
Put it down!

01:56:55.089 --> 01:56:58.801
There's the gun up there
in the glass window!

01:56:59.886 --> 01:57:04.557
- Call an ambulance! Bring him in!
- Oh, my God! They're escaping!

01:57:39.675 --> 01:57:42.261
Did Jack Carpenter
say anything before he died?

01:57:42.428 --> 01:57:46.390
- Will you put up another candidate?
- Will you announce your candidacy?

01:57:46.515 --> 01:57:50.937
When a man is gunned down in the street

01:57:52.021 --> 01:57:58.986
because of what he stands for,
you tell me where this country is going.

01:57:59.153 --> 01:58:04.659
And the saddest part is that that's
exactly what Jack was always saying.

01:58:04.825 --> 01:58:07.662
That we have got to return this country...

01:58:07.787 --> 01:58:11.499
- He saw me.
- ...to the country that we grew up in.

01:58:11.666 --> 01:58:15.628
They got a second killer.
Carpenter didn't have a chance.

01:58:15.795 --> 01:58:18.130
Neither would you, without your gun.

01:58:19.048 --> 01:58:23.427
And if I have to run
in Jack Carpenter's stead,

01:58:24.303 --> 01:58:26.681
then that's what I will do.

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:30.309
Got here as soon as I could.

01:58:30.434 --> 01:58:32.895
We are bustin' people
all over the country.

01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:35.898
That printout you gave us was a gold mine.

01:58:36.023 --> 01:58:40.528
We got money, weapons. Washington
is gonna make a statement in an hour.

01:58:40.695 --> 01:58:43.155
We did it, Cathy.

01:58:43.322 --> 01:58:45.616
We got 'em.

01:58:45.783 --> 01:58:48.244
It's the best thing
that ever happened to them.

01:58:48.411 --> 01:58:52.289
- Now they got their own martyr.
- We got 'em, Cathy. Don't you get it?

01:58:52.456 --> 01:58:56.252
- Busting 'em all over the country.
- Gary knew who I was.

01:58:56.627 --> 01:58:58.629
How?

01:58:58.796 --> 01:59:01.549
- They got someone on the inside.
- They couldn't have.

01:59:01.674 --> 01:59:03.759
They got friends all over.

01:59:04.802 --> 01:59:08.431
- It doesn't matter. We'll get 'em.
- We'll never get 'em.

01:59:09.181 --> 01:59:11.350
Anyway, we'll never get all of 'em.

01:59:12.893 --> 01:59:18.315
You can't stop 'em by waiting for 'em
to commit a crime each time, Michael.

01:59:18.441 --> 01:59:20.693
Where are you goin'?

01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:23.612
- I had to kill him.
- Of course you had to kill him.

01:59:23.737 --> 01:59:26.282
- I didn't have any choice, right?
- No.

01:59:28.325 --> 01:59:31.829
Where are you goin'? You need
protection. They know who you are.

01:59:31.996 --> 01:59:35.207
They'll put you in that computer
and they'll all know.

01:59:35.374 --> 01:59:37.835
Stay with us. We're your family.
We protect you.

01:59:38.002 --> 01:59:40.171
No, I never had a family, Michael.

01:59:40.337 --> 01:59:43.090
You were my family.
The Bureau was my family.

01:59:43.257 --> 01:59:45.342
I trusted you. You used me.

01:59:45.509 --> 01:59:49.305
You betrayed me. I betrayed...
I don't have a family any more.

01:59:49.471 --> 01:59:54.018
- I don't have anything. I got too dirty.
- We won, for Chrissake!

01:59:54.518 --> 01:59:58.022
- You won.
- Catherine, where are you gonna go?

01:59:58.189 --> 02:00:00.274
Just away.

02:00:00.441 --> 02:00:02.943
Cathy, there ain't no going away.

02:00:43.943 --> 02:00:46.779
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I love you.

02:00:46.904 --> 02:00:49.365
- A whole big bunch?
- A whole big bunch.

02:00:55.913 --> 02:00:57.957
