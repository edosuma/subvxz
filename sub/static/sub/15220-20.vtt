00:25.112 --> 00:28.574
Theorising that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,

00:28.574 --> 00:32.077
Dr Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator

00:32.077 --> 00:34.121
and vanished.

00:38.834 --> 00:41.920
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:41.920 --> 00:44.882
facing mirror images
that were not his own...

00:44.882 --> 00:49.386
and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:50.262 --> 00:54.766
His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,

00:54.766 --> 00:59.313
who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:59.646 --> 01:03.692
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.692 --> 01:06.778
striving to put right
what once went wrong...

01:06.778 --> 01:10.073
and hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:10.073 --> 01:12.117
will be the leap home.

01:13.410 --> 01:15.454
(BOOING AND JEERING)

01:18.915 --> 01:20.792
PA: This should be
one heck of a match.

01:20.792 --> 01:24.087
The Executioners have
devastated everybody they've faced

01:24.087 --> 01:27.174
and tonight doesn't look like
it's going to be any different.

01:27.883 --> 01:31.136
Tag me! What are you doing? Tag me!

01:32.054 --> 01:35.140
Executioner I isn't even
waiting for the young Soviet -

01:35.140 --> 01:37.142
Get in there!
Oh, this looks ugly!

01:37.517 --> 01:39.603
Let's go.
OK.

01:39.603 --> 01:41.647
Whoa!

01:43.106 --> 01:45.317
Prepare to die, Russki!

01:49.321 --> 01:51.365
Whoa!

03:08.900 --> 03:11.987
PA: The Executioner has the kid
in the airplane spin.

03:12.487 --> 03:16.449
I guess this is what they call
'learning things the hard way'!

03:16.449 --> 03:18.493
Whoa!

03:19.536 --> 03:21.663
Terry, get up!

03:21.663 --> 03:23.915
Get up! Get up!

03:23.915 --> 03:26.585
The big man is going
for the flying guillotine.

03:26.585 --> 03:29.588
This could be the all she wrote
for the kid from Moscow!

03:29.588 --> 03:34.176
Oh! I sure hope this youngster has
a few more tricks up his sleeve,

03:34.176 --> 03:36.386
cos he's definitely going
to need them.

03:37.137 --> 03:40.640
Go!
And that's one right here.

03:43.476 --> 03:45.520
What'd you do that for?

03:46.188 --> 03:48.064
Come on, Joe, get up!

03:50.108 --> 03:52.110
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

03:52.277 --> 03:54.070
I er...
Get to your corner.

03:54.070 --> 03:57.574
An unconventional move, for sure.
You're out!

03:57.574 --> 03:59.826
I'll make my way into the ring
for the decision.

04:00.452 --> 04:03.204
Are you OK?
Get a doctor in.

04:03.204 --> 04:05.582
Ladies and gentleman, the winner,

04:05.582 --> 04:08.793
in a time
of one minute and eight seconds,

04:08.793 --> 04:10.962
Ivan and Nikolai,

04:10.962 --> 04:14.674
the Battling Russkies!
Yeah!

04:16.216 --> 04:19.678
As you folks at home can see,
this is really not a popular -

04:19.678 --> 04:22.098
Shut up, you capitalist pig!

04:23.141 --> 04:25.185
Did you people see my brother, huh?

04:25.852 --> 04:29.356
We are the two finest acts
in the world!

04:29.898 --> 04:33.485
We are the fastest,
we are the smartest

04:33.485 --> 04:35.528
and we are the strongest.

04:35.779 --> 04:39.866
We are champions!
(GROWLS)

04:40.575 --> 04:42.619
(GROWLS)

04:43.995 --> 04:47.290
These two...are imposters!

04:48.500 --> 04:51.252
My brother Nikolai and I,

04:51.252 --> 04:53.421
we ask the question,

04:53.421 --> 04:58.176
why do the famous Shiloh Boys
avoid us, huh?

04:59.219 --> 05:01.429
Why do you think this is so,
my brother?

05:01.429 --> 05:03.807
Cos...they...

05:03.807 --> 05:07.268
they're afraid of us.
Ah! That's right!

05:07.268 --> 05:11.356
They are afraid to lose
their championship belts, huh?

05:12.148 --> 05:15.819
Tell them, brother, what we will do
if we ever get them in the ring.

05:16.903 --> 05:19.906
We will treat them like
the capitalist pigs that they are.

05:19.906 --> 05:22.992
Ah! That's right!

05:23.618 --> 05:26.538
We shall eat them.

05:26.538 --> 05:29.332
Eat them like the pigs
that they are.

05:33.503 --> 05:35.547
Give me that mike.

05:37.841 --> 05:40.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't touch that dial.

05:40.510 --> 05:43.513
We'll be back
with another terrific match

05:43.513 --> 05:46.015
from the Georgia Wrestle-A-Thon,

05:46.015 --> 05:49.185
after these messages
from our local sponsors.

05:56.943 --> 05:59.070
What are you looking at?

06:01.322 --> 06:03.366
(MUFFLED) Nothing. Nothing at all.

06:17.547 --> 06:19.924
Boy, we made some people
mad out there. Mad?

06:19.924 --> 06:22.051
Hell, they'd like
to tear our heads off.

06:22.343 --> 06:24.387
Wait a second.

06:26.055 --> 06:28.183
You're not Russian.

06:28.183 --> 06:30.560
Ha! Well, don't tell me,

06:30.560 --> 06:32.604
tell that bunch out there.

06:36.733 --> 06:40.028
That was one hell of a move
back there. Where'd you learn it?

06:40.445 --> 06:43.823
Oh, I just er...just
kind of invented it.

06:43.823 --> 06:45.867
Oh, you kind of invented it, huh?

06:46.117 --> 06:48.161
Well, listen.
I know you're new at this,

06:48.161 --> 06:50.830
but next time you're
going to go inventing something,

06:50.830 --> 06:54.083
just let everybody know first, huh?
Lamar likes the matches to go

06:54.083 --> 06:57.795
a little longer than
a minute and eight seconds.
He knows how long the matches

06:57.795 --> 07:01.007
are going to be before they start?
How long and who's going to win.

07:01.007 --> 07:04.510
All except the title matches -
then it's every man for himself.

07:09.307 --> 07:11.726
It just must be all the excitement.
Yeah.

07:11.726 --> 07:14.729
You are the manager,
you've got to take control.

07:14.729 --> 07:16.981
Look, it-it was a mistake.

07:18.066 --> 07:19.984
Would you er...mind telling me

07:19.984 --> 07:22.403
what the hell you think
you were doing out there?

07:23.821 --> 07:27.158
Well, you see, I was er...
Look, he was trying to make a point.

07:27.158 --> 07:30.453
What point?
That we're ready for a title shot.

07:30.453 --> 07:33.247
Oh, is that what
the poster thing was about?

07:33.790 --> 07:37.168
To try to pressure me
into giving you a title match?

07:37.168 --> 07:40.421
Well, you saw that move
that Terry made, it was terrific.

07:40.421 --> 07:42.632
It was incredible,

07:42.632 --> 07:44.926
but it wasn't in the script.

07:44.926 --> 07:48.680
Oh, so he got a little carried away,
what damage did it do?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.560
How is he?

07:54.560 --> 07:57.522
He has a slight concussion.
Can he wrestle tomorrow?

07:58.272 --> 08:00.900
He should probably rest.
That is not what I asked.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.777
I need him
on the undercard tomorrow.

08:03.695 --> 08:05.738
No.

08:08.658 --> 08:10.493
No damage done, huh?

08:10.493 --> 08:13.246
Oh, so he's young,
but it was still one hell of a move.

08:13.246 --> 08:17.583
Now, look, I have already signed
with the Shiloh Boys

08:17.583 --> 08:19.627
to meet the Mongolians tomorrow.

08:19.919 --> 08:22.463
Now, you have got to wait your turn.

08:23.047 --> 08:25.258
And no more of that kicking stuff.

08:30.263 --> 08:32.765
Well, I guess that's that.

08:33.099 --> 08:35.226
I'm not going to give up that easy.

08:35.727 --> 08:37.520
He's all right.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.647
Cheer up, little brother.

08:39.647 --> 08:41.691
At least we won this time.

08:44.402 --> 08:46.654
'If this was the thrill of victory,

08:46.654 --> 08:49.615
I didn't want to be around
for the agony of defeat.

08:51.909 --> 08:56.038
The optimistic part of my brain was
saying that maybe the worst was over,

08:56.038 --> 09:00.668
but the realistic side kept telling
me that my troubles had just begun.'

09:03.129 --> 09:05.715
You know, that was
one hell of a move out there.

09:07.508 --> 09:11.012
Yes, siree. Those kind of moves
will get you a lot of attention.

09:11.721 --> 09:13.764
Carl was really impressed.

09:14.348 --> 09:16.392
He was?

09:17.143 --> 09:19.812
Wasn't too happy about this.
Oh, yeah, well...

09:21.230 --> 09:23.274
I thought it was great -

09:23.941 --> 09:26.903
Hey! I'm taking a shower.
Get out of here! Come on in!

09:26.903 --> 09:28.863
- but brave.

09:28.863 --> 09:31.032
Look, you know,
I really need to er...

09:31.032 --> 09:33.534
take a shower now,
cos I'm kind of sweaty.

09:33.534 --> 09:37.413
And, probably, this'd be a good time
for you to er...you know, leave.

09:38.331 --> 09:41.459
OK?
Well, sweat never hurt anything.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.253
In fact, I insist on it.

09:44.962 --> 09:48.799
I just can't get over
how young and attractive you are.

09:49.675 --> 09:52.261
Not like the rest of these animals.

09:52.261 --> 09:55.473
Sherri!
Oh, damn.

09:55.890 --> 09:59.435
Sherri, where are you?
Quit your yelling! I'm right here!

10:05.399 --> 10:07.443
Er...nice hat, Mr Shiloh.

10:07.902 --> 10:12.031
Well, looky here, if it ain't
the leaping little poster-eater.

10:12.031 --> 10:13.866
How's it going, boy?

10:14.450 --> 10:18.454
What are you doing in here?
I was just congratulating the kid.

10:19.121 --> 10:21.499
You got to be -
We were just talking, all right?

10:22.291 --> 10:24.335
You got to get that close to talk?

10:24.794 --> 10:27.672
You ain't trying to rustle my wife,
are you, boy?

10:27.672 --> 10:31.342
Rustle? Oh, no. As a matter of fact,
we were just about to do it,

10:31.342 --> 10:33.511
right here on the floor,
when you walked in.

10:33.511 --> 10:35.638
BOTH: What?

10:35.638 --> 10:37.682
Ha! She's kidding.

10:37.682 --> 10:39.850
She's just a kidder!

10:39.850 --> 10:42.853
Such a kidder.
Tell him you're kidding, OK?

10:49.276 --> 10:51.696
Come on, Carl,
let's go get something to eat.

10:52.363 --> 10:54.407
I'm starving.

10:56.575 --> 10:58.619
Watch your step, pee-wee.

10:59.578 --> 11:02.915
I'd hate to have
to break you in half.

11:28.190 --> 11:30.234
You know, that's the first time

11:30.234 --> 11:33.070
I have ever seen a vending machine
with a head on it.

11:33.070 --> 11:35.114
Who is that?

11:35.656 --> 11:38.951
Carl Shiloh.
And who's the lady in red?

11:38.951 --> 11:41.829
Mrs Carl Shiloh - you ready for that?

11:41.829 --> 11:45.666
Really? Yeah.
Boy, she better have strong bones.

11:45.666 --> 11:48.669
Well, having strong bones
would be a big plus around here, Al.

11:48.669 --> 11:51.130
What's going on?
Erm...

11:52.173 --> 11:56.260
Well, let's see. July 23rd, 1955.

11:56.260 --> 11:59.096
Your name is Terry Sammis
and you and your brother

11:59.096 --> 12:03.684
are professional wrestlers, AKA the
Battling Russkies. Clever name, huh?

12:04.101 --> 12:06.312
Ronny?
Yeah, well, that's your brother

12:06.312 --> 12:08.856
and you're managed by your mother,
Lottie.

12:08.856 --> 12:12.151
Where am I?
Er...Atlanta, Georgia.

12:12.151 --> 12:16.030
It's a live television
wrestling show of some sort -

12:16.030 --> 12:18.657
Everybody acts like I'm new at this.
Well, you are.

12:18.657 --> 12:20.951
Terry just joined the team
about a week ago,

12:20.951 --> 12:24.788
when his oldest brother, Frank,
died in a car crash.

12:25.122 --> 12:29.251
And the father was known
as Slammin' Sammy Sammis.

12:29.251 --> 12:32.004
You're kidding?
Would I make up a name like that?

12:32.004 --> 12:34.757
He worked the circuit for ten years
until he passed away,

12:34.757 --> 12:36.550
never made it to the big time.

12:36.550 --> 12:38.928
And before Frank died, he and Ronny

12:38.928 --> 12:41.764
were touted
as legitimate title contenders.

12:42.473 --> 12:44.850
So that's what I'm doing here then,
right? Well -

12:44.850 --> 12:47.061
Help get them a shot at the title?
Ronny!

12:47.811 --> 12:49.897
Ronny!

12:50.314 --> 12:52.441
Ronny! Where's your brother?

12:52.441 --> 12:54.443
Well, he's in the...

12:54.443 --> 12:56.820
Oh. Oh, Ronny.
Oh, calm it, Mom.

12:56.820 --> 12:59.156
Get out here.
What's going on?

12:59.365 --> 13:01.408
We got it.

13:01.784 --> 13:03.869
Got what?
A title match!

13:03.869 --> 13:06.997
As long as Terry doesn't do
any more of those fancy kicks,

13:06.997 --> 13:10.084
you're wrestling
for the championship!

13:10.084 --> 13:12.836
What? What about the Mongolians?
Oh, they're in jail.

13:12.836 --> 13:16.215
Seems like they got drunk in Denver
and punched out a couple of cops.

13:16.215 --> 13:18.842
Lamar is into this
for a lot of money,

13:18.842 --> 13:22.513
so instead of cancelling,
he offered the match to us.

13:23.180 --> 13:26.183
Why?
Cos he doesn't have anybody else.

13:26.809 --> 13:30.062
Oh, I wish your father and
your brother were here to see this.

13:31.063 --> 13:33.691
Oh, I better go
and sign those contracts,

13:33.691 --> 13:36.026
before he changes his mind.

13:37.861 --> 13:41.282
Well, smile, little brother.
This is what we've been waiting for.

13:42.950 --> 13:46.412
Don't tell me that was Mom.
Yeah, that's Mom. This is great.

13:46.412 --> 13:49.915
It's incredible. I leap in here
to help get them a title shot -

13:49.915 --> 13:52.418
Sam - The way I'm looking at this
I get it right away -

13:52.418 --> 13:55.212
Sam. Sam. Sam.
What?

13:55.212 --> 13:58.590
Ronny cannot wrestle
in that title match. Why not?

13:58.590 --> 14:01.468
Because if he does,
he's going to die.

14:08.654 --> 14:12.158
How could a guy like that, in that
kind of shape, die tomorrow night?

14:12.158 --> 14:15.328
Well, Ziggy's
still working on the specifics.

14:15.328 --> 14:17.663
Er...he's got family er...

14:17.997 --> 14:21.334
Oh, Myra. That's Ronny's wife, Myra.
Yeah.

14:21.334 --> 14:24.962
They've been married eight year
They've got a little boy named Hank.

14:24.962 --> 14:28.257
Oh, no. Al, look, I need to know
exactly what happened to him. Oh...

14:28.257 --> 14:30.927
Well, I'll go back
and see if I can't hurry it up. OK.

14:30.927 --> 14:33.012
But, listen, in the meantime,

14:33.012 --> 14:35.890
you've got to think of a way
to keep him out of the ring.

14:38.142 --> 14:39.852
(SIGHS)

14:40.937 --> 14:42.772
Myra was really excited.

14:42.772 --> 14:45.107
She couldn't believe
it was finally happening.

14:45.107 --> 14:46.943
It is unbelievable all right.

14:46.943 --> 14:49.362
Hank even got on the phone,
made me promise

14:49.362 --> 14:51.906
I'd hang my championship belt up
over his bed.

14:52.698 --> 14:56.369
Oh, maybe after we win this thing
I could get us a house, huh?

14:56.786 --> 14:58.996
Sure be nice
to get the family off the road.

14:58.996 --> 15:00.998
Yeah, yeah. That would be nice.

15:00.998 --> 15:04.210
Listen, I-I know you're really
cramped up in that little trailer,

15:04.210 --> 15:07.338
but things will be different
after we win this belt, I promise.

15:07.338 --> 15:09.840
You know what?
Since Lamar won't let you use

15:09.840 --> 15:13.719
any more of those fancy kick moves,
maybe we should work on a new hold.

15:14.136 --> 15:16.472
How do you feel about the sleeper?
Sleeper?

15:16.472 --> 15:18.391
Oh, yeah. Real crowd-pleaser.

15:18.391 --> 15:20.935
All you got to do
is get your arm round a guy's neck,

15:20.935 --> 15:23.729
cut off his oxygen.
What, you just make the guy pass out?

15:24.063 --> 15:26.774
Yeah, just an idea.

15:26.774 --> 15:29.110
If we're going to be
the main attraction,

15:29.110 --> 15:31.153
we got to pump this thing up a bit.

15:31.153 --> 15:33.239
Yeah, erm...well...

15:34.532 --> 15:37.201
You know, are you sure
we're really ready for this?

15:38.452 --> 15:42.331
What do you mean? Maybe we're in
a little over our heads, that's all.

15:42.331 --> 15:46.961
Over our heads? Look, Terry, I know
you were just a kid when Pop died,

15:46.961 --> 15:49.672
but you got to remember
how much he wanted to be champ.

15:49.672 --> 15:51.590
No, I-I remember that.

15:52.133 --> 15:54.010
It's just that sometimes...

15:54.010 --> 15:56.554
I think you need
to do what's right for yourself.

15:57.013 --> 15:59.181
For myself?

15:59.181 --> 16:01.934
What about Frankie?
What about his dream?

16:02.727 --> 16:05.438
Ronny...Frankie's dead.

16:06.647 --> 16:08.691
I know he's dead.

16:10.276 --> 16:12.278
I held him in my arms.

16:13.612 --> 16:15.740
Look...

16:15.740 --> 16:17.950
I made him a promise, Terry.

16:18.826 --> 16:21.662
I gave him my word
that I'd get those belts.

16:25.833 --> 16:29.420
And what are we talking about?
This is a celebration, right?

16:30.254 --> 16:32.173
Two more coming up,

16:32.173 --> 16:35.885
for the next tag-team champions!

16:36.844 --> 16:38.804
Two more beers!

16:38.804 --> 16:40.931
I hope you're not planning
on a hangover

16:40.931 --> 16:44.226
to keep him out of the ring.
About as good as I got right now.

16:44.477 --> 16:48.022
Has Ziggy come up with anything
about how he was killed? He wasn't.

16:48.022 --> 16:50.775
What do you mean he wasn't?
He wasn't killed. He just died.

16:51.150 --> 16:53.652
You told me he was killed
during the match. I did.

16:53.652 --> 16:55.488
Well, I mean he is going to.

16:55.488 --> 16:58.616
Well, eyewitnesses ringside
said that Ronny was tagging out

16:58.616 --> 17:00.534
and he just collapsed.

17:00.534 --> 17:03.913
Which happens when your heart stops.
He died from heart failure?

17:03.913 --> 17:07.165
According to the death certificate.
Well, what was the cause of it?

17:07.165 --> 17:09.251
We don't know, it's not determined.

17:09.877 --> 17:12.922
Right, Al, have Ziggy
run Ronny's medical history.

17:12.922 --> 17:16.634
I want to know
everything that has happened to him
from the moment he was born.

17:16.634 --> 17:19.178
Everything? OK.
That will take a little time.

17:19.178 --> 17:21.305
Why don't you ask him?
You're a doctor.

17:22.765 --> 17:26.352
To you, I'm a doctor. To them,
I'm a wrestler, remember? Oh.

17:26.352 --> 17:28.186
The only thing I can do right now

17:28.186 --> 17:30.314
is make sure he doesn't
over exert himself.

17:30.314 --> 17:32.441
If what you're telling me is right,

17:32.441 --> 17:35.694
then any stress is going to kill him.
RONNY: Well, looky here.

17:35.694 --> 17:37.821
How about a bar fight?
Huh?

17:37.821 --> 17:40.199
If you boys want to belly-up
I'll buy them. Oh, no.

17:40.199 --> 17:42.034
We don't drink with no communist.

17:42.034 --> 17:44.995
Why don't we take him outside
and hang him from the flagpole?

17:44.995 --> 17:47.998
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on,
fellas? Stay out of it, Terry.

17:47.998 --> 17:51.168
Would you listen to that?
They even talk like Americans.

17:51.168 --> 17:53.545
I seen Germans do that once
in a war movie.

17:53.545 --> 17:57.383
Well, we sound like Americans
because we are Americans.

17:57.591 --> 17:59.969
What do we look like?
A couple of idiots?

18:00.678 --> 18:02.763
Hey, we watch television.

18:02.763 --> 18:06.058
We seen you two strutting around
in your little red outfits.

18:07.017 --> 18:10.521
OK. OK. I get what this is all about.
Look...

18:10.521 --> 18:12.564
those are just characters
that we play.

18:12.773 --> 18:14.692
Would you listen to this guy, Eddy?

18:14.692 --> 18:17.695
Next thing he'll be telling us
that wrestling ain't real.

18:17.695 --> 18:21.240
These are the kind of guys that keep
those fishing programmes on the air.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.951
Don't even try to explain it
to these morons.

18:24.118 --> 18:27.454
Oh, maybe you'd like to step outside
and say that? Oh, you got it.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.040
Yeah - No, no, no. Look, guys.
We don't want to do that.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.335
We don't. We don't want to fight
with you guys. You know what I think?

18:33.335 --> 18:35.838
I think they're chicken.
Is that what you two are?

18:35.838 --> 18:38.048
A couple of commie chickens.
(SQUAWKS)

18:39.800 --> 18:42.302
Yes, we are.
We are chickens, actually.

18:42.302 --> 18:44.680
Besides, you guys
look like you're pretty tough

18:44.680 --> 18:47.641
and er...we really wouldn't
want to mess with you, you know.

18:47.641 --> 18:50.644
Oh, what the hell - Nah, so
we're just going to leave right now,

18:50.644 --> 18:53.605
and you guys can get back
to whatever it is you were doing, OK?

18:53.605 --> 18:56.608
Come on, man, let's go. Let's go.
Yeah, you fly him out of here,

18:56.608 --> 18:59.737
before we have to pluck you.
I should kick this boy's head off

18:59.737 --> 19:02.948
is what I should be doing -
Ronny, come on. It's not worth it.

19:02.948 --> 19:06.493
You gonna let him off that easy?
Get him out of here, Sam.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.579
You going to push me?

19:13.959 --> 19:17.171
Myra, you should have seen
his flying feet.

19:17.171 --> 19:19.923
Too bad we can't do
that kind of stuff in the ring.

19:19.923 --> 19:22.468
I'm sure it was wonderful. More?

19:22.468 --> 19:26.221
Oh, no, no, no. I'm getting stuffed
here. It's really, really good.

19:26.221 --> 19:29.475
Now, don't you act like it was
our fault. That guy asked for it.

19:29.475 --> 19:31.351
They always ask for it.

19:31.351 --> 19:34.813
You know, one of these times you're
going to run into the wrong person.

19:34.813 --> 19:36.815
Honey, we can
take care of ourselves.

19:36.815 --> 19:40.319
If you'd ever come to any
of these matches, you'd know that.

19:40.319 --> 19:42.821
If I want to see violence,
I'll watch the news.

19:48.535 --> 19:52.289
I just don't understand why you two
have to pretend to be Russians.

19:52.289 --> 19:56.210
Well, I explained that. See, there's
good guys and there's bad guys.

19:56.210 --> 19:59.671
And right now, we happen
to be the bad guys, right, sport?

20:00.005 --> 20:02.049
Right!
Right.

20:02.925 --> 20:05.761
Well, I know one little bad guy
who needs to go to bed.

20:05.761 --> 20:08.305
Hmm, I think she's talking
about you, little man.

20:08.305 --> 20:10.974
Do I have to?
Yes.

20:19.316 --> 20:22.110
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong?
Put him down. Put him down.

20:22.110 --> 20:24.238
You all right?
Yeah...

20:24.238 --> 20:26.657
I just feel a little dizzy,
that's all.

20:26.657 --> 20:29.117
I just got up
from the table too fast.

20:29.117 --> 20:32.120
Here, I'll take him.
No! It's all right, I'll do it.

20:36.708 --> 20:39.670
Come on, hero.
Let's go read a bedtime story.

20:43.507 --> 20:46.426
I know he's you brother,
but sometimes...

20:49.638 --> 20:51.807
I'm worried about him, Terry.

20:52.349 --> 20:54.643
This has happened before,
is that right?

20:55.018 --> 20:57.062
At first, it was every so often.

20:57.312 --> 20:59.398
And now,
it's happening all the time.

20:59.815 --> 21:02.150
He wakes up at night
in a cold sweat.

21:03.360 --> 21:06.154
I asked him to see a doctor,
but you know your brother,

21:06.154 --> 21:08.573
he'd rather die
than admit he's sick.

21:10.117 --> 21:13.829
You know, the worst thing is I think
he'd quit this crazy business

21:13.829 --> 21:16.456
if it weren't
for that promise he made to Frank.

21:17.499 --> 21:20.711
That and...
That and what?

21:22.462 --> 21:24.506
Your mother.

21:24.923 --> 21:28.427
I don't want to offend you,
Terry, but...

21:28.427 --> 21:30.721
sometimes,
I think she'd risk everything

21:30.721 --> 21:32.764
just for that stupid title.

21:33.265 --> 21:35.309
She's -
What?

21:36.310 --> 21:38.353
Obsessed?

21:40.022 --> 21:42.065
I better go see
how the boys are doing.

21:47.738 --> 21:50.032
I don't know
why Ronny ever married that girl.

21:51.366 --> 21:53.702
She's weak.
She's worried about him.

21:54.202 --> 21:56.830
Who, Ronny?
She's worried he might be sick.

21:57.456 --> 21:59.499
He doesn't look sick to me.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.461
Maybe a little tired.
Mom...

22:05.505 --> 22:07.924
..has Ronny ever had any trouble
with his heart?

22:09.760 --> 22:11.636
What are you talking about?

22:12.804 --> 22:15.140
Well, I - I just
have this feeling that...

22:15.140 --> 22:17.559
that maybe he shouldn't wrestle
tomorrow night,

22:17.559 --> 22:19.936
that if he does something bad
is going to happen.

22:19.936 --> 22:24.858
Not wrestle? But, Terry...Terry,
this is our big chance.

22:24.858 --> 22:28.612
This is what we have been dreaming
about, what we've been working for.

22:28.612 --> 22:31.073
Could we at least have a doctor
check him out first?

22:31.073 --> 22:33.033
Look, I told you before, he's fine.

22:33.033 --> 22:35.535
I only want what's best for my boys.

22:36.787 --> 22:39.414
What's best for us?
Or what's best for Pop and Frankie?

22:42.084 --> 22:44.252
Son...

22:44.252 --> 22:48.507
if you're scared I can always
get someone else to take your place.

22:54.346 --> 22:56.473
You're going to thank me later,

22:56.473 --> 22:58.558
when you're world champions.

22:59.935 --> 23:01.978
Night!

23:05.398 --> 23:08.652
'I could hardly blame Lottie
for thinking I was afraid.

23:08.652 --> 23:13.740
After all, I was asking her to throw
away the family dream on a feeling.

23:14.783 --> 23:17.077
I had to come up
with something more concrete

23:17.077 --> 23:19.496
if I was going to convince Ronny
not to wrestle.

23:21.122 --> 23:23.375
I hope these trailers
have name tags.'

23:27.671 --> 23:29.756
Hello? Anybody home?

23:31.591 --> 23:33.593
Oh, this is fun (!)

23:33.593 --> 23:36.179
Can't find my trailer,
can't find the lights.

23:39.641 --> 23:41.685
(SIGHS)

23:42.811 --> 23:46.773
Why doesn't anything good
ever happen to me? Maybe it just did.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.794
It's just been so hot lately.

23:56.461 --> 23:58.505
What are you doing here?

24:02.425 --> 24:05.261
The air conditioner
in our trailer's busted.

24:08.892 --> 24:12.186
Carl's real good at wrecking things,

24:12.186 --> 24:15.148
but when it comes to fixing them...

24:15.148 --> 24:17.567
he's just all thumbs.

24:26.242 --> 24:29.037
Why don't you come over here
so I can see you better?

24:29.662 --> 24:31.497
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

24:32.624 --> 24:35.919
Why not?
Because you're a married woman.

24:36.586 --> 24:38.838
And I just don't think
that it would look good.

24:41.090 --> 24:43.927
To who?
Well, to your husband, for one.

24:44.886 --> 24:47.055
Remember him?
The man you're married to.

24:47.347 --> 24:50.391
The rather large man
who enjoys ripping things apart.

24:53.144 --> 24:55.188
Don't worry about him.

24:56.147 --> 24:58.816
He's busy watching
The Three Stooges.

25:00.526 --> 25:04.155
He won't even know...that I'm gone.

25:08.242 --> 25:10.620
Yeah, right.
And what do you think he would do

25:10.620 --> 25:12.622
if he saw you here like this?

25:13.956 --> 25:16.084
Before...

25:16.084 --> 25:18.211
or after he kills you?

25:18.211 --> 25:20.254
Yeah, right. And that is my point.

25:20.672 --> 25:23.591
The thought of you two fighting
over me,

25:23.591 --> 25:26.177
well, it just makes me want
to quiver.

25:26.177 --> 25:28.262
Yeah, well, me too.
Relax.

25:28.262 --> 25:30.640
Relax, come on.

25:30.890 --> 25:34.936
No-one is even going to catch you,
silly. (BANGING)

25:35.395 --> 25:37.980
Sherri!
Uh-oh.

25:38.523 --> 25:40.692
(BANGING)

25:40.692 --> 25:45.446
I know you're in there
with that wife-stealing weasel!

25:46.781 --> 25:48.616
Sherri!
Ssh!

25:48.616 --> 25:51.202
I'm going to pull his arms off.
Maybe he'll go away.

25:51.202 --> 25:53.371
I'm going to pull his legs off.

25:53.371 --> 25:56.707
I'm going to pluck his eyeballs
from his head!

25:57.375 --> 25:59.502
Where is that moron?

25:59.502 --> 26:01.546
Sherri!

26:03.381 --> 26:05.425
(SCREAMS)

26:06.175 --> 26:08.344
He's going to kill you!

26:08.344 --> 26:10.972
You act like this happens
all the time. It does.

26:11.889 --> 26:15.184
Open up,
you back-stabbing wife stealer.

26:15.184 --> 26:18.813
I've been doing some checking,
and it turns out Mrs Sasquatch here

26:18.813 --> 26:21.190
gets her jollies
from watching her husband

26:21.190 --> 26:23.943
dismember other men on her behalf.
What?

26:23.943 --> 26:27.155
Yeah, she's left a trail
of broken necks from coast-to-coast.

26:27.613 --> 26:30.992
You set me up?
Well, a girl's got to have a hobby.

26:31.284 --> 26:33.536
And she's got a point.
(BANGS AND SHOUTS)

26:36.539 --> 26:38.749
That's not going to help.
Why not?

26:41.252 --> 26:43.421
Got you!

26:43.421 --> 26:47.341
Does that hurt?
Now I'm going to tear your head off

26:47.341 --> 26:50.178
and shove it up your -
(SCREAMS)

26:50.720 --> 26:52.930
I tried to warn you.

26:52.930 --> 26:54.974
Warn me?! You tried to kill me.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.894
Ah, I'm going to die.

26:58.895 --> 27:00.938
Sam, get in here.

27:02.899 --> 27:04.942
Argh! Oh...

27:10.615 --> 27:12.366
Come on, get up!

27:13.367 --> 27:15.411
I think he is letting himself in.

27:15.995 --> 27:18.206
Come on, up out of there. Up!
I'm trying.

27:18.581 --> 27:21.334
Sam! Sam, come on.

27:21.334 --> 27:24.587
You want to stay down there
or you want to get out? Come on up!

27:29.091 --> 27:31.218
Oh, Carl.

27:31.218 --> 27:33.554
Can't you do anything right?

27:36.933 --> 27:40.186
Can you believe it? Can you believe
how she set me up like that?

27:40.186 --> 27:42.688
Well, you know, there's women
that get a big thrill

27:42.688 --> 27:44.523
out of watching men suffer.

27:44.941 --> 27:47.526
Trust me on this.
I've been married to most of them.

27:48.527 --> 27:50.613
I got to get out of here, Al.

27:50.613 --> 27:53.407
Any luck on getting Ronny
to drop the match? No, no.

27:53.824 --> 27:57.495
He's determined as ever to keep his
promise to Frank to get those belts.

27:57.495 --> 28:00.539
How about Mom?
She's as wrapped up in this as he is.

28:00.539 --> 28:03.376
Does Ziggy have anything new
on his medical history?

28:03.376 --> 28:07.129
Well, it turns out that wrestlers
move around as much as the military,

28:07.129 --> 28:09.298
but don't worry,
we'll get something soon.

28:09.298 --> 28:12.802
We just have to find some way to let
Ronny know that he's in danger.

28:13.052 --> 28:15.471
Yeah, well, how we going to do that?
Well...

28:15.930 --> 28:18.849
Maybe if I could get him examined
by a doctor, you know.

28:18.849 --> 28:21.102
Or get him to a -
How? How you going to do that?

28:21.102 --> 28:24.563
No! No! No!
Come on, guys, pick it up.

28:24.855 --> 28:28.526
Well, I'll go back and try
and hurry Ziggy up and...

28:28.526 --> 28:31.362
And er...good luck.
Get that camera over here, OK?

28:32.780 --> 28:37.201
Why, you're on the undercard! You're
about as tough as my grandmother.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.954
Make sure those lights are good,

28:39.954 --> 28:42.873
I don't want any burnouts
during the show tomorrow.

28:42.873 --> 28:45.000
Kid, what are you doing here
so late?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.002
I couldn't sleep.

28:47.002 --> 28:48.963
Slam him, dammit!

28:49.171 --> 28:51.507
You're not dancing with your sister.

28:54.969 --> 28:58.347
Could I...could I talk to you?
Well, I am a little busy right now.

28:58.347 --> 29:00.391
Look, it's really important.

29:07.314 --> 29:10.234
Sure you don't want anything?
No, no. I'm fine, thanks.

29:10.776 --> 29:12.945
So, what can I do for you?

29:12.945 --> 29:15.656
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about the match tomorrow.

29:15.656 --> 29:17.491
Well, everything will be OK

29:17.491 --> 29:19.660
if you promise to keep your feet
on the floor.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.787
No, no.
That's not exactly what I meant.

29:22.413 --> 29:24.415
Well, what then?
Er...

29:25.833 --> 29:28.752
..Lamar, I need you
to cancel the match.

29:30.087 --> 29:33.132
You what? Now...now,
listen, don't get me wrong,

29:33.132 --> 29:36.594
I mean, we really appreciate the
opportunity and everything, but...

29:36.594 --> 29:38.679
See, I just don't think
that right now

29:38.679 --> 29:40.931
would be a good time for Ronny
to wrestle.

29:40.931 --> 29:43.225
I...I really don't understand.

29:43.225 --> 29:46.520
Well...see, he's very sick.

29:47.062 --> 29:50.357
Well, why didn't he come to me
earlier and tell me about it?

29:50.357 --> 29:52.693
Well, I'm not sure
that he really knows.

29:52.693 --> 29:54.737
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

29:54.737 --> 29:57.156
Let me get this straight.
You're saying he's sick

29:57.156 --> 29:59.658
and he doesn't know it?
It's kind of hard to explain.

29:59.658 --> 30:02.661
Oh, I can imagine. Now, come on.

30:02.661 --> 30:07.374
I have got a lot of money invested
in putting this match together,

30:07.374 --> 30:10.002
and I am just not going
to blow it off.

30:10.377 --> 30:12.463
I'm not saying you have to do that,

30:12.463 --> 30:15.674
I'm just saying maybe you could
go out and get a...new team?

30:17.176 --> 30:19.386
Where?

30:19.386 --> 30:21.639
I mean, we...we are 24 hours away

30:21.639 --> 30:23.807
from when the camera starts to roll.

30:24.642 --> 30:27.728
Oh, my son. Look...

30:27.728 --> 30:30.981
you're just nervous.
Now you go home,

30:30.981 --> 30:34.193
you get some sleep - everything'll
look better in the morning.

30:37.947 --> 30:40.115
Let me just say this, if I'm right,

30:40.115 --> 30:43.661
and Ronny does get hurt,
you're going to be held liable.

30:44.745 --> 30:46.789
And you could lose everything.

30:47.581 --> 30:51.502
Now, all I'm asking is that
you just bring a doctor in and...

30:51.502 --> 30:53.545
do a checkup on him, that's all.

30:56.048 --> 30:58.092
All right. All right.

30:59.259 --> 31:02.471
Have him in the dressing room
tomorrow morning at eight o'clock.

31:02.471 --> 31:05.099
He'll be there. All right.
Yes, sir. Thank you.

31:11.647 --> 31:13.983
I don't understand
why they're doing this.

31:13.983 --> 31:17.361
Well, I think they're probably
just worried something might happen

31:17.361 --> 31:21.198
and they want to cover all the bases.
If you ask me it's the Shilohs.

31:21.198 --> 31:24.284
I think they're afraid they're
going to lose their belt - Terry!

31:24.284 --> 31:26.453
Ronny!

31:26.453 --> 31:29.790
How you feeling today, son?
I don't know what this is all about,

31:29.790 --> 31:33.335
but you go tell them there ain't
no way it's is ever going to work.

31:33.335 --> 31:36.547
Whoa! Now what the hell
you're talking about?

31:36.547 --> 31:39.800
I'm talking about the Shilohs,
I know who's behind this.

31:41.218 --> 31:44.555
Well, now...

31:44.555 --> 31:47.641
I don't know where
you're getting your information,

31:47.641 --> 31:52.563
but this has got absolutely
nothing to do with the Shilohs.

31:54.148 --> 31:56.275
You want to blame somebody,

31:56.275 --> 31:58.318
you talk to your brother.

31:59.111 --> 32:01.864
This is your idea?
Now, listen to me.

32:01.864 --> 32:05.451
Myra's been talking to me about some
of the problems you've been having,

32:05.451 --> 32:07.536
the dizzy spells,
shortness of breath -

32:07.536 --> 32:09.788
Well, I've been
on the road for almost a year,

32:09.788 --> 32:11.832
I'm just a little bit beat,
that's all.

32:11.832 --> 32:14.042
There's more to it than that,
you know that.

32:14.042 --> 32:19.923
Why don't...we just let Dr Greggs
here finish his exam?

32:20.382 --> 32:22.426
And then we'll all know.

32:24.970 --> 32:28.557
Breath in...

32:28.557 --> 32:30.684
and out.

32:30.684 --> 32:32.811
Breath in...

32:32.811 --> 32:34.938
and out.

32:34.938 --> 32:36.982
You can put your shirt on now.

32:37.858 --> 32:39.902
Well?

32:40.152 --> 32:43.238
He's fit as a fiddle. There's
a little congestion in his lungs,

32:43.238 --> 32:45.073
but nothing to worry about.

32:45.073 --> 32:46.909
Well, there you go.

32:46.909 --> 32:49.286
Wait a minute,
that's all you're going to do?

32:49.286 --> 32:51.455
What else would you suggest?

32:51.455 --> 32:54.750
Well, I would suggest starting
with chest X-rays,

32:54.750 --> 32:58.462
then maybe an
EKG, MRI, do a CAT scan.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.007
CAT scan?
Look, if he has a heart defect,

33:02.007 --> 33:04.510
there's no way
a simple examination like this

33:04.510 --> 33:06.845
is ever going to be able
to figure that out.

33:06.845 --> 33:08.972
Heart defect?
Oh, now...

33:08.972 --> 33:12.434
Look, I'm saying that - Excuse me?
- there's no way you can tell

33:12.434 --> 33:14.770
from this kind of an exam -
Terry, that's enough!

33:14.770 --> 33:16.813
I know what I'm talking about here!

33:17.147 --> 33:19.900
I apologise for my brother.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.152
He's just been
a little bit jumpy lately.

33:24.279 --> 33:26.949
All right...we'll see you later.

33:26.949 --> 33:28.992
Yeah, later.

33:36.416 --> 33:39.253
Ronny, you can't do this.

33:39.836 --> 33:41.672
Now, you know I'm right, don't you?

33:41.672 --> 33:43.882
You know
there is something wrong with you.

33:43.882 --> 33:47.135
I know that I promised Frankie
that I would get those belts,

33:47.135 --> 33:49.263
and I'm not going to quit
till I get them.

33:51.556 --> 33:53.517
Even if it kills you?

33:53.684 --> 33:55.727
Even if it kills me.

34:05.966 --> 34:08.009
So, Lamar didn't do anything?

34:08.301 --> 34:11.012
Oh, yeah, yeah. He had
the ring doctor check Ronny out.

34:11.012 --> 34:14.181
Oh, well, he must have
picked up something. Uh-huh.

34:14.181 --> 34:16.309
He did. He picked up his medical bag

34:16.309 --> 34:19.396
right after he pronounced
Ronny fit as a fiddle. Fit?

34:19.396 --> 34:21.940
This doctor must walk like a duck.
(WHIRRING)

34:21.940 --> 34:24.192
What?
Well, because he's a quack.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.235
This handlink is going nuts here.

34:26.820 --> 34:31.032
Oh! Oh, it's Ronny's medical
history. Thank you, Ziggy. Finally.

34:31.032 --> 34:32.826
And?
Well, let's see.

34:32.826 --> 34:34.953
The normal childhood illnesses,

34:34.953 --> 34:37.121
a couple of broken bones,

34:37.121 --> 34:41.251
rheumatic fever when he was eight,
he was bed-ridden a couple of weeks.

34:41.251 --> 34:44.045
No nose bleeds -
No, no, no, wa-wa-wait a second.

34:44.045 --> 34:46.130
That could be it. That could be it.
What?

34:46.130 --> 34:49.842
The rheumatic fever. That could have
caused damage to his heart. It's...

34:49.842 --> 34:51.719
mitral stenosis.
Michael who?

34:51.719 --> 34:54.264
No, no, no. Mitral stenosis.
Oh, mitral.

34:54.264 --> 34:56.600
A narrowing of the valves
around the heart.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.935
That could have been
a result of the fever.

34:58.935 --> 35:02.188
That could cause his heart to fail?
Mitral stuff? Yes, it could.

35:02.188 --> 35:04.399
And it will.
I've got to go talk to him.

35:06.151 --> 35:08.194
Watch that the door
doesn't fall off!

35:11.239 --> 35:13.533
Ronny, come on.
You need medical attention.

35:13.533 --> 35:16.328
What are you talking about?
When you were eight years old,

35:16.328 --> 35:19.497
you contracted rheumatic fever.
I think it damaged your heart -

35:19.497 --> 35:22.626
damage that could kill you
if you wrestle tomorrow night.

35:22.626 --> 35:24.711
Oh, come on. You're going to tell me

35:24.711 --> 35:27.547
that something
that happened 20 years ago - Ronny!

35:29.299 --> 35:31.343
How did you know about that fever?

35:32.260 --> 35:34.346
You weren't even born yet.

35:36.473 --> 35:39.100
Er...well, you know,
Frankie told me about it.

35:39.392 --> 35:41.353
Well, so what? I was sick.

35:41.353 --> 35:44.397
Kids get sick.
Yeah, not like that.

35:44.898 --> 35:46.983
We were so worried about you.

35:47.233 --> 35:50.028
We weren't even sure
that you were going to live.

35:50.028 --> 35:53.490
Don't do this, Mom. Look, what if -
That was a long time ago.

35:53.490 --> 35:55.533
What if Terry is right?

35:55.867 --> 35:59.871
You know, the doctor said there
could be problems later on, but...

35:59.871 --> 36:01.956
I never thought that it...

36:03.291 --> 36:05.335
Maybe we should wait.
What?

36:05.877 --> 36:09.923
At least until we can get you
checked out, by a specialist. No!

36:10.298 --> 36:13.635
Look, I have already lost
a husband and a son.

36:13.635 --> 36:15.970
I am not going to lose you too!

36:17.931 --> 36:19.974
There'll be other nights.

36:21.976 --> 36:24.104
I'll go tell Lamar.
Wait!

36:24.104 --> 36:26.439
Wait! This is my life
we're talking about

36:26.439 --> 36:28.775
and I'm going to decide
what I do with it.

36:28.775 --> 36:31.528
Look, what if Terry is right?
What if he's wrong?

36:31.820 --> 36:33.696
I'm not going to throw this away.

36:33.696 --> 36:37.492
You two do whatever you have to do,
but I'm going to get in that ring

36:37.492 --> 36:40.703
and I'm going to wrestle
for the title, with or without you.

36:40.995 --> 36:43.081
Ronny!

36:47.460 --> 36:49.587
I don't think this is a good idea.

36:49.587 --> 36:51.714
I don't have a choice, Al.

36:51.714 --> 36:53.716
Besides...

36:53.716 --> 36:55.969
I got a plan.
Oh, yeah. What kind of a plan?

36:56.553 --> 36:59.264
Ronny dies because he wrestles,
right? So?

36:59.264 --> 37:01.141
So I make sure that he doesn't.

37:01.141 --> 37:03.309
Well, what are you going to do?

37:03.309 --> 37:05.395
I don't tag out.
What?

37:05.395 --> 37:07.355
That's not a plan, that's suicide.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.440
Look, you got a better idea?

37:11.484 --> 37:14.028
OK. All right. So you wrestle,
which I think is nuts.

37:14.028 --> 37:17.991
But how does that solve the problem
of getting Ronny treated? Well...

37:19.492 --> 37:21.578
..I have an idea for that too.

37:22.704 --> 37:24.789
Ronny.

37:26.791 --> 37:29.961
Listen, about what happened.
Oh...forget it.

37:29.961 --> 37:32.005
No, I don't want to forget it.

37:32.630 --> 37:34.674
I want to make a deal with you.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.720
What kind of deal?
Yeah, what kind of deal?

37:39.804 --> 37:42.974
I want you to give me your word
that if we win the title tonight

37:42.974 --> 37:46.561
you'll check in to a hospital
for a complete physical examination.

37:46.561 --> 37:48.688
But there's nothing wrong with me.

37:48.688 --> 37:50.773
Then it won't matter, will it?

37:52.400 --> 37:54.485
Deal?

37:55.737 --> 37:58.823
Yeah, it's a deal.
OK.

38:01.326 --> 38:04.120
Both here.
Just about to get started.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.249
You two got any questions?

38:08.249 --> 38:11.336
You just make sure you get
those belts shined up real nice.

38:15.340 --> 38:17.425
You're kidding, right?

38:18.551 --> 38:21.846
I mean... Oh, now wait a minute.

38:22.221 --> 38:24.724
You don't honestly
think you're going to win?

38:24.724 --> 38:28.394
You're damn right we do.
Now what's going on here, Lamar?

38:28.645 --> 38:31.898
Oh, come on, I thought
you boys had that figured out.

38:31.898 --> 38:34.484
Figured what out?
You can't win.

38:34.484 --> 38:38.237
Can't win? What are you talking
about? This is a title match.

38:38.655 --> 38:40.990
Well, you bet it's a title match.

38:41.741 --> 38:43.826
And you boys are the Russians.

38:44.202 --> 38:47.455
Now, how the hell is it going
to look to the American public

38:47.455 --> 38:51.417
to have a couple of communists
be the world champions?

38:52.126 --> 38:55.671
But we're not from Russia,
we're from Arkansas.

38:57.673 --> 39:00.718
I know that, you know that,

39:00.718 --> 39:03.096
but John Q Public don't know that.

39:03.805 --> 39:07.350
To him, you represent
the epitome of evil.

39:07.767 --> 39:09.811
Something to be destroyed.

39:11.145 --> 39:14.690
All right.
If it'll make you feel better...

39:14.690 --> 39:18.069
the exposure you are going
to get from this match

39:18.069 --> 39:21.864
is going to keep you boys
working for years.

39:22.323 --> 39:24.325
This ain't right.
This is a title match

39:24.325 --> 39:26.494
and we ought
to have a chance of winning it.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.579
He's right.

39:33.209 --> 39:35.336
This is the real thing.

39:35.336 --> 39:37.964
Man to man, fight to the death.

39:40.550 --> 39:43.386
I'll see you in the ring, boy.

39:44.595 --> 39:49.559
Uh-oh. According to Ziggy, there's a
75.3% chance he's going to kill you.

39:50.643 --> 39:53.729
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

39:54.313 --> 39:59.193
And welcome to
Georgia Wrestle-A-Thon.

40:00.278 --> 40:03.656
Tonight's programme -
Sam, you can't do this.

40:03.990 --> 40:07.451
You don't know anything - What
chance does Ronny have if I don't?

40:11.122 --> 40:13.207
It is time for the main event.

40:13.708 --> 40:18.379
It is a no-time-limit,
tag-team championship bout.

40:22.216 --> 40:25.720
Introducing...the challengers.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.598
(BOOING)
They are from Moscow.

40:30.057 --> 40:35.313
(BOOING)
They weigh in at 510lb.

40:35.313 --> 40:41.319
Ivan and Nikolai,
the Battling Russkies!

40:41.319 --> 40:43.404
Yeah!

40:43.738 --> 40:45.865
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

40:45.865 --> 40:47.950
the champions.

40:48.326 --> 40:54.206
They have a combined weight
of...538lb.

40:54.832 --> 40:58.085
They hail
from the great state of Texas.

40:58.461 --> 41:02.173
Introducing...Carl and Clem,

41:02.173 --> 41:04.717
the Shilohs!

41:04.717 --> 41:06.802
(CHEERING)

41:09.639 --> 41:12.683
You're going down, boy.

41:18.105 --> 41:20.149
Er...Sam, I...

41:20.524 --> 41:22.443
Just checking.
I'll start.

41:22.443 --> 41:24.528
No, no. I got it.
All right.

41:24.528 --> 41:26.530
Listen...

41:26.530 --> 41:28.491
you just be real careful.

41:29.492 --> 41:33.412
And here we go, folks -
You know, Sam er...

41:33.412 --> 41:35.581
he's probably all talk.

41:35.831 --> 41:37.708
He's probably just all talk.

41:41.796 --> 41:44.715
Yeah, maybe he's not all talk, Sam.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.843
I think I'll step down.

41:48.344 --> 41:50.471
The champion isn't wasting any time.

41:52.181 --> 41:55.893
It looks like Nikolai
has a few surprises of his own.

41:56.644 --> 41:59.772
I just don't think
you want to get the Shilohs angry.

42:01.691 --> 42:03.818
They're feeling each other out.

42:03.818 --> 42:05.736
Stalking each other.

42:05.736 --> 42:08.114
These two teams
have never met each other before.

42:08.739 --> 42:11.075
You can't miss him.
He can't see you, brother.

42:11.075 --> 42:13.160
Hold up!

42:15.705 --> 42:17.498
Oh, my boy!

42:20.334 --> 42:24.422
Carl Shiloh looks as ready
as I've ever seen him.

42:25.756 --> 42:29.176
Heck, there's no time - You're going
to be dead meat, Shiloh!

42:30.803 --> 42:32.888
It could be a long night.

42:34.181 --> 42:36.851
Carl picks up Nikolai.
Here comes the knee drop!

42:38.352 --> 42:40.813
Oh! That's got to hurt.

42:42.481 --> 42:45.067
Tag my arm! Tag my arm!

42:46.026 --> 42:48.195
He's pulling his hair,
that's unfair!

42:48.487 --> 42:51.073
No! I'm just not sure
how much more he can take.

43:23.814 --> 43:25.983
At the last he manages to kick off,

43:25.983 --> 43:28.694
but I just don't know
how much more punishment

43:28.694 --> 43:30.863
he can take from this big Texan.

43:36.076 --> 43:38.162
I told you, boy!

43:38.954 --> 43:41.040
Sam, are you OK?

43:42.082 --> 43:45.461
Do I look OK?
Oh, well, not really.

43:45.711 --> 43:48.631
Sam, this is insane.
You've been in there for an hour.

43:48.631 --> 43:50.758
I got to beat him, Al.
Beat him?!

43:50.758 --> 43:53.719
You couldn't even slow him down
with a tranquilliser gun.

43:55.679 --> 43:57.681
That's the answer.
What's the answer?

43:57.681 --> 44:00.517
You did it, Al. What?
I got to put him to sleep.

44:00.517 --> 44:03.771
Sure, sing him a lullaby (!)
How can you put him to sleep?

44:04.480 --> 44:06.899
I'm going to cut off the oxygen
to his brain.

44:07.650 --> 44:09.652
What?
Cut off the oxygen to his -

44:11.278 --> 44:13.530
Brain? What brain?

44:15.991 --> 44:18.577
I think the champ's ready
to finish it.

44:21.622 --> 44:27.836
Looks like Carl Shiloh is setting up
Nikolai for his famous whip!

44:32.424 --> 44:35.386
Oh, wait! Wait a second!

44:35.386 --> 44:38.555
Nikolai's got Carl in the sleeper!

44:38.555 --> 44:40.724
(BOOING)

44:40.724 --> 44:43.686
The sleeper! You got him.
You got him, Sam.

44:44.144 --> 44:46.730
You go with that sleeper!
Squeeze him!

44:47.231 --> 44:49.566
He's going...
Squeeze him!

44:49.942 --> 44:52.611
He's going!
Squeeze him!

44:53.112 --> 44:55.155
He's gone!

44:58.158 --> 45:01.495
You did it! You did it, Sam!
All right!

45:01.495 --> 45:03.747
Oh, I can't believe it!

45:05.040 --> 45:07.292
You saw it!

45:07.292 --> 45:09.545
We have new tag-team champions!

45:09.795 --> 45:14.049
Nikolai and Ivan,
the Battling Russkies!

45:14.049 --> 45:16.844
Unbelievable!

45:19.221 --> 45:21.223
Yeah, thanks.

45:25.394 --> 45:27.688
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

45:27.688 --> 45:30.399
Tell you what,
I don't feel very smart right now.

45:31.817 --> 45:34.445
You could've been killed out there.
So could you.

45:35.404 --> 45:37.573
I don't understand why you did this.

45:37.573 --> 45:39.533
You will
after you go to the hospital.

45:39.533 --> 45:41.994
Oh, will you come off of that -
Hey, hey, hey.

45:43.120 --> 45:45.205
You want to see the sleeper again?

45:46.623 --> 45:48.750
Huh?

45:48.750 --> 45:50.878
All right. All right.
All right, I'll go.

45:50.878 --> 45:52.880
A deal's a deal.
Yeah.

45:56.675 --> 45:58.760
Is he going to be OK, Al?

45:58.927 --> 46:00.804
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, he's going to be OK.

46:00.804 --> 46:03.098
He'll just get some medication
for his heart.

46:03.098 --> 46:05.350
He doesn't wrestle again, does he?
No.

46:05.350 --> 46:07.561
No, but his son does.
What?

46:07.936 --> 46:10.439
His son does in
the '68 Olympics, silver medalist.

46:10.439 --> 46:12.483
You're kidding? That's great.

46:12.774 --> 46:14.943
Bring him in here. Through here.

46:14.943 --> 46:17.654
Right over here.
Right here on this nice table.

46:17.654 --> 46:19.781
Here you go.

46:19.781 --> 46:22.242
Oh! Honey!

46:22.242 --> 46:24.328
Honey. Sweetheart.

46:25.287 --> 46:27.873
What did they do to you?

46:32.878 --> 46:35.047
It's your fault.

46:35.047 --> 46:38.842
Look at him.
Look what you did to my baby.

46:39.718 --> 46:43.138
I just wish he'd have caught you
in that trailer

46:43.138 --> 46:46.308
and torn you up, hard.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.687
Oh, honey.

46:50.687 --> 46:52.773
How's my little pumpkin?

46:53.523 --> 46:55.609
Momma's going to take you home.

46:56.276 --> 46:58.820
Er... No.
Yeah.

46:59.071 --> 47:02.616
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
It'll make you feel better.

47:02.616 --> 47:06.119
No, I really - I would do it if...
And she wouldn't even feel it.

47:06.828 --> 47:10.123
I really... I don't think
that I would ever do anything...

47:16.088 --> 47:18.173
(SIREN)

47:19.883 --> 47:21.885
Get the kids to their room now.
Go!

47:22.636 --> 47:24.721
Move, move!

47:25.138 --> 47:27.099
Come on, Hank. Get to cover!

47:27.516 --> 47:29.685
Get down!

47:29.685 --> 47:31.812
And put your mask on.
Why?

47:31.812 --> 47:35.023
The Russians just dropped a bomb
on New York City.

47:35.399 --> 47:38.735
What?
It's World World III!

47:39.820 --> 47:41.905
Get down!

47:43.699 --> 47:45.784
Oh, no.
