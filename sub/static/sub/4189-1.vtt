01:26.487 --> 01:30.241
<i>Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard,</i>
<i>Los Angeles, California.</i>

01:30.407 --> 01:33.524
<i>It; s about five o; clock in the morning.</i>

01:33.687 --> 01:38.158
<i>That; s the homicide squad, complete</i>
<i>with detectives and newspapermen.</i>

01:39.047 --> 01:44.246
<i>A murder; s been reported from one</i>
<i>of those houses in the 10000 block.</i>

01:44.407 --> 01:47.285
<i>You; ll read about it</i>
<i>in the late editions.</i>

01:47.447 --> 01:51.042
<i>You; ll get it over your radio</i>
<i>and on television,</i>

01:51.207 --> 01:56.486
<i>because an old-time star is involved,</i>
<i>one of the biggest.</i>

01:56.647 --> 02:00.401
<i>But before you hear it all distorted</i>
<i>and blown out of proportion,</i>

02:00.567 --> 02:03.764
<i>before those Hollywood</i>
<i>columnists get their hands on it,</i>

02:03.927 --> 02:08.318
<i>maybe you; d like to hear the facts,</i>
<i>the whole truth.</i>

02:08.487 --> 02:12.082
<i>If so, you; ve come to the right party.</i>

02:12.247 --> 02:16.365
<i>The body of a young man was found</i>
<i>in the pool of her mansion,</i>

02:16.527 --> 02:21.601
<i>with two shots in his back and one</i>
<i>in his stomach. Nobody important.</i>

02:21.767 --> 02:25.601
<i>Just a writer with a couple</i>
<i>of B-pictures to his credit.</i>

02:26.607 --> 02:30.361
<i>The poor dope!</i>
<i>He always wanted a pool.</i>

02:30.527 --> 02:37.046
<i>In the end, he got himself a pool,</i>
<i>only the price turned out a little high.</i>

02:38.887 --> 02:43.438
<i>Let; s go back about six months</i>
<i>and find the day when it all started.</i>

02:43.607 --> 02:47.486
<i>I was living in an apartment house</i>
<i>above Franklin and lvar.</i>

02:47.647 --> 02:49.956
<i>Things were tough at the moment.</i>

02:50.127 --> 02:53.836
<i>I hadn; t worked</i>
<i>in a studio for a long time.</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:58.922
<i>So I sat there grinding out</i>
<i>original stories, two a week.</i>

02:59.087 --> 03:01.999
<i>Only I seemed to have lost my touch.</i>

03:02.167 --> 03:07.480
<i>Maybe they weren; t original enough,</i>
<i>maybe they were too original.</i>

03:07.647 --> 03:11.925
<i>All I know is,</i>
<i>they didn; t sell.</i>

03:12.887 --> 03:14.798
Yep?

03:23.607 --> 03:25.677
- Joseph C Gillis?
- That's right.

03:25.847 --> 03:30.079
- We've come for the car.
- What car?

03:30.247 --> 03:34.763
1946 Plymouth convertible,
California licence 40 R 116.

03:34.927 --> 03:38.556
- Where are the keys?
- Why should I give you them?

03:38.727 --> 03:42.436
The company's played ball long
enough, you're three payments behind.

03:42.607 --> 03:45.519
And we've got a court order.
The keys.

03:45.687 --> 03:50.158
- Or do you want us to haul it away?
- The car isn't here.

03:50.327 --> 03:53.364
- Is that so?
- I loaned it to a friend.

03:53.527 --> 03:56.917
- He took it to Palm Springs.
- Gone away for his health?

03:57.087 --> 04:02.798
- If you don't believe me, look.
- We believe you, now believe us.

04:02.967 --> 04:06.926
That car better be here by noon
tomorrow or there'll be fireworks.

04:07.087 --> 04:09.806
You say the cutest things.

04:20.367 --> 04:26.522
<i>I needed about $290 and I needed</i>
<i>it real quick, or l; d lose my car.</i>

04:26.687 --> 04:30.646
<i>It wasn; t in Palm Springs,</i>
<i>and it wasn; t in the garage.</i>

04:30.807 --> 04:33.605
<i>I was way ahead</i>
<i>of the finance company.</i>

04:33.767 --> 04:37.123
<i>I knew they; d come</i>
<i>and I wasn; t taking chances.</i>

04:37.287 --> 04:42.486
<i>So I kept it across the street</i>
<i>behind Rudy; s shoeshine parlour.</i>

04:42.647 --> 04:45.798
<i>Rudy never asked any questions</i>
<i>about your finances,</i>

04:45.967 --> 04:49.323
<i>he; d just look at your heels</i>
<i>and know the score.</i>

04:53.207 --> 04:56.438
<i>I had an original story</i>
<i>kicking around Paramount.</i>

04:56.607 --> 05:02.204
<i>My agent said it was dead,</i>
<i>but I knew a bigshot who liked me.</i>

05:02.367 --> 05:06.838
<i>The time had come to take advantage</i>
<i>of it. His name was Sheldrake.</i>

05:07.007 --> 05:12.365
<i>He was a smart producer</i>
<i>with a set of ulcers to prove it.</i>

05:13.087 --> 05:16.159
You've got five minutes.
What's your story about?

05:16.327 --> 05:21.526
A baseball player, a rookie shortstop
that's batting 347, once did a hold-up,

05:21.687 --> 05:25.123
but he's trying to go straight,
except some gamblers won't let him.

05:25.287 --> 05:28.484
They tell him
he's got to throw the World Series?

05:28.647 --> 05:31.115
More or less. I've got a gimmick.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.324
- Got a title?
- "Bases Loaded". There's an outline.

05:34.487 --> 05:38.400
Call readers department, find out
what they have on "Bases Loaded".

05:39.527 --> 05:42.678
They're pretty hot about it
at Twentieth, except Zanuck's all wet.

05:42.847 --> 05:45.042
Can you see
Ty Power as the shortstop?

05:45.207 --> 05:47.767
You've got the best man, Alan Ladd.

05:47.927 --> 05:51.397
It'd be a change of pace for Ladd.
And simple to shoot.

05:51.567 --> 05:55.879
Lots of outdoors stuff. I bet you
could make it for under a million.

05:56.047 --> 05:58.515
- Excuse me.
- There's a great part for Bill Demarest.

05:58.687 --> 06:02.646
An old trainer got beaned,
goes out of his head sometimes.

06:02.807 --> 06:06.925
Hello, Mr Sheldrake. "Bases Loaded",
I covered it with a two-page synopsis.

06:07.087 --> 06:09.362
- Thanks.
- But I wouldn't bother.

06:09.527 --> 06:11.165
- What's wrong?
- It's from hunger.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.045
Nothing for Ladd?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.880
It's a rehash of something
not very good.

06:16.047 --> 06:21.804
You'll be glad to meet Mr Gillis,
he wrote it. This is Miss Kramer.

06:21.967 --> 06:28.520
The name's Schaefer, Betty Schaefer.
I wish I could crawl in a hole with it.

06:28.687 --> 06:33.715
- If I could be of any help.
- Sorry, I just didn't think it was good.

06:33.887 --> 06:35.878
I found it flat and trite.

06:36.407 --> 06:39.956
What kind of material do you
recommend? Joyce, Dostoyevsky?

06:40.127 --> 06:42.277
I think pictures should say something.

06:42.887 --> 06:47.119
Just a story won't do. You'd have
turned down "Gone with the Wind".

06:47.287 --> 06:51.485
No, that was me. I said,
"Who wants to see a Civil War picture?"

06:52.487 --> 06:57.197
I hated "Bases Loaded" because I knew
your name. I'd heard you had talent.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.278
This year, I'm trying to earn a living.

06:59.447 --> 07:02.803
So you take plot 27 A,
make it glossy and slick?

07:02.967 --> 07:06.164
Those are dirty words.
You sound like New York critics.

07:06.327 --> 07:10.240
- That'll be all Miss Kramer... Schaefer.
- Goodbye, Mr Gillis.

07:10.407 --> 07:13.524
Next time, I'll write you
"The Naked and the Dead".

07:13.687 --> 07:18.522
Well, seems like Zanuck
has got himself a baseball picture.

07:18.687 --> 07:22.043
Don't think I thought
this would win an Academy Award.

07:22.207 --> 07:26.758
We're looking for a Betty Hutton.
Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?

07:26.927 --> 07:29.521
- Frankly, no.
- Wait a minute.

07:29.687 --> 07:32.884
If we made it a girls' softball team,
put in a few numbers,

07:33.047 --> 07:37.677
might be a musical: "It Happened in
the Bullpen: The Story of a Woman".

07:38.727 --> 07:42.845
Are you trying to be funny, because
I'm out of laughs. I need a job.

07:43.007 --> 07:46.795
- I haven't got a thing.
- Any assignment, additional dialogue.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.400
Nothing, honest.

07:51.287 --> 07:56.441
Mr Sheldrake, could you let me have
300 bucks as a personal loan?

07:56.847 --> 07:59.441
Could I? Gillis...

08:01.367 --> 08:03.961
Last year, somebody talked me
into buying a ranch,

08:04.127 --> 08:06.641
so I borrowed the money.

08:06.807 --> 08:11.756
This year, I had to mortgage the
ranch to keep up my life insurance...

08:15.167 --> 08:17.920
<i>After that,</i>
<i>I drove down to headquarters.</i>

08:18.087 --> 08:21.045
<i>That; s how a lot of us</i>
<i>think about Schwab; s drugstore.</i>

08:21.207 --> 08:24.916
<i>Kind of a combination office,</i>
<i>Kaffeeklatsch and waiting room.</i>

08:25.087 --> 08:28.875
<i>Waiting... Waiting for the gravy train.</i>

08:30.647 --> 08:35.198
<i>I got myself ten nickels and started</i>
<i>sending out a general SOS.</i>

08:35.366 --> 08:38.164
<i>I couldn; t get hold of my agent,</i>
<i>naturally.</i>

08:38.327 --> 08:41.524
<i>So I called a pal of mine,</i>
<i>Artie Green.</i>

08:41.687 --> 08:44.406
<i>An awful nice guy,</i>
<i>an assistant director.</i>

08:44.567 --> 08:48.924
<i>He could let me have twenty,</i>
<i>but twenty wouldn; t do.</i>

08:49.087 --> 08:54.320
<i>Then I talked to a couple of yes-men</i>
<i>at Metro. To me, they said no.</i>

08:54.487 --> 08:58.162
<i>Finally, I located that agent of mine.</i>
<i>The big faker!</i>

08:59.087 --> 09:02.716
<i>Was he out digging up</i>
<i>a job for poor Joe Gillis?</i>

09:02.887 --> 09:07.324
<i>He was hard at work in Bel Air,</i>
<i>making with the golf sticks.</i>

09:09.767 --> 09:15.000
You need $300? Of course I could
give you $300, only I'm not going to.

09:15.167 --> 09:18.284
- No?
- I'm not just your agent.

09:18.447 --> 09:21.917
- It's not the 10%. I'm your friend.
- You are?

09:22.087 --> 09:25.318
The finest things have been
written on an empty stomach.

09:25.487 --> 09:29.036
Once your talent gets into that
Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through.

09:29.207 --> 09:33.359
Forget that! It's a car I'm talking
about. Losing it is like losing my legs.

09:33.527 --> 09:38.282
Greatest thing that could happen.
Now you'll have to sit down and write.

09:38.447 --> 09:42.122
What do you think I've been doing?
I need $300.

09:42.287 --> 09:47.645
Sweetheart, maybe what
you need is another agent.

09:57.207 --> 10:01.041
<i>As I drove back towards town,</i>
<i>I took inventory of my prospects.</i>

10:01.207 --> 10:03.596
<i>They now added up to exactly zero.</i>

10:03.767 --> 10:06.839
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>I just didn; t have what it takes.</i>

10:07.007 --> 10:10.886
<i>The time had come to wrap up</i>
<i>the Hollywood deal and go home.</i>

10:11.047 --> 10:15.404
<i>Maybe if I hocked all my junk, there; d
<i>be enough for a ticket back to Ohio,</i></i>

10:15.567 --> 10:20.357
<i>to that $35-a-week job at the copy</i>
<i>desk of the; ; Dayton Evening Post; ;,</i>

10:20.527 --> 10:25.282
<i>if it was still open, back</i>
<i>to the smirking delight of the office.</i>

10:25.447 --> 10:29.122
<i>All right, why don; t you</i>
<i>take a crack at Hollywood?</i>

10:29.287 --> 10:31.084
<i>Maybe you think you could...</i>

10:32.487 --> 10:34.159
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

11:27.687 --> 11:30.759
<i>l; d landed in the driveway</i>
<i>of some big mansion</i>

11:30.927 --> 11:33.646
<i>that looked rundown and deserted.</i>

11:33.807 --> 11:36.560
<i>At the end of the drive</i>
<i>was a lovely sight.</i>

11:36.727 --> 11:41.482
<i>A great big empty garage,</i>
<i>just standing there going to waste.</i>

11:41.647 --> 11:47.244
<i>If ever there was a place to stash</i>
<i>a car with a hot licence number.</i>

11:55.167 --> 11:57.840
<i>There was another</i>
<i>occupant in that garage.</i>

11:58.007 --> 12:00.919
<i>An enormous</i>
<i>foreign-built automobile.</i>

12:01.087 --> 12:04.397
<i>It must; ve burned up</i>
<i>ten gallons to a mile.</i>

12:04.567 --> 12:10.483
<i>It had a 1932 licence. I figured that; s
<i>when the owners had moved out.</i></i>

12:11.207 --> 12:16.406
<i>I couldn; t go back to my apartment</i>
<i>now those bloodhounds were on to me.</i>

12:16.567 --> 12:21.436
<i>The idea was to stay at Artie Green; s
<i>until I could make that bus for Ohio.</i></i>

12:21.607 --> 12:24.883
<i>Once in Dayton,</i>
<i>l; d drop the credit boys a postcard</i>

12:25.047 --> 12:28.801
<i>telling them</i>
<i>where to pick up the jalopy.</i>

12:30.487 --> 12:33.684
<i>It was a great big</i>
<i>white elephant of a place.</i>

12:33.847 --> 12:37.522
<i>The kind crazy movie people</i>
<i>built in the crazy twenties.</i>

12:37.687 --> 12:40.963
<i>A neglected house</i>
<i>gets an unhappy look.</i>

12:41.127 --> 12:43.516
<i>This one had it in spades.</i>

12:43.687 --> 12:46.918
<i>It was like that old woman</i>
<i>in; ; Great Expectations; ;,</i>

12:47.087 --> 12:51.285
<i>that Miss Havisham in her rotting</i>
<i>wedding dress and her torn veil,</i>

12:51.447 --> 12:55.804
<i>taking it out on the world</i>
<i>because she; d been given the go-by.</i>

13:01.167 --> 13:04.398
You there, why are you so late?

13:05.527 --> 13:09.839
Why have you kept me
waiting so long?

13:17.647 --> 13:18.966
In here.

13:26.207 --> 13:28.926
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blowout. I thought...

13:29.087 --> 13:32.602
- Go on in.
- Maybe I'd better take my car...

13:32.767 --> 13:35.235
Wipe your feet.

13:37.527 --> 13:39.279
Go on.

13:43.287 --> 13:46.518
You're not properly
dressed for the occasion.

13:46.687 --> 13:50.521
- What's the occasion?
- Have him come up, Max.

13:50.687 --> 13:53.599
- Up the stairs.
- Listen for a minute...

13:53.767 --> 13:57.442
- Madame is waiting.
- For me?

13:58.607 --> 14:00.279
OK.

14:06.807 --> 14:09.799
If you need help
with the coffin, call me.

14:28.487 --> 14:30.000
This way.

14:36.287 --> 14:37.845
In here.

14:38.367 --> 14:41.200
I put him on my massage table
by the fire.

14:41.367 --> 14:45.918
He always liked fires
and poking at them with a stick.

14:50.487 --> 14:54.196
We'll bury him in the garden.
Any city laws against that?

14:55.567 --> 14:57.523
- I wouldn't know.
- I don't care, anyway.

14:57.687 --> 15:01.805
I want the coffin to be white
and specially lined with satin,

15:01.967 --> 15:05.357
white or deep pink.

15:07.447 --> 15:11.599
Maybe red, bright, flaming red.
Let's make it gay.

15:20.287 --> 15:24.678
How much? Don't give me
a fancy price just because I'm rich.

15:26.407 --> 15:30.958
Lady, you've got the wrong man.
I had some trouble with a flat tyre.

15:31.127 --> 15:35.962
I pulled in till I could get a spare.
I thought the house was empty.

15:36.127 --> 15:40.757
- It is not. Get out.
- I'm sorry.

15:40.927 --> 15:46.206
I'm sorry you lost your friend.
I don't think red is the right colour.

15:46.367 --> 15:51.282
- Haven't I seen you before?
- Get out, or shall I call my servant?

15:51.927 --> 15:55.397
You're Norma Desmond.
You were big in silent pictures.

15:57.247 --> 16:02.002
I am big. It's the pictures
that got small.

16:02.487 --> 16:05.763
I knew there was
something wrong with them.

16:05.927 --> 16:08.157
They're dead, they're finished.

16:08.327 --> 16:12.161
There was a time
when they had the eyes of the world.

16:12.327 --> 16:16.639
But that wasn't good enough.
They had to have the ears, too.

16:16.807 --> 16:21.358
So they opened their big mouths
and out came talk, talk, talk!

16:21.527 --> 16:25.679
That's where the popcorn business
comes in. Buy it to plug your ears.

16:25.847 --> 16:29.396
Look at them in the front offices,
the masterminds!

16:29.567 --> 16:31.558
They smashed the idols!

16:31.727 --> 16:34.321
The Fairbankses,
the Gilberts, the Valentinos!

16:34.487 --> 16:37.001
Who've we got now? Some nobody.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.920
Don't blame me. I'm just a writer.

16:40.607 --> 16:43.963
You are? Writing words,
words, more words.

16:44.127 --> 16:46.960
You've made a rope of words
and strangled this business.

16:47.127 --> 16:49.925
But there's a microphone
to catch the last gurgles,

16:50.087 --> 16:52.726
and Technicolor to photograph
the swollen tongue.

16:52.887 --> 16:57.563
- Sh! You'll wake up the monkey.
- Get out! Max.

16:57.727 --> 17:00.116
Next time
I'll bring my autograph album.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.996
Or maybe some cement
and ask for your footprint.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.164
It's OK, OK. I'm going.

17:09.327 --> 17:13.036
Just a minute, you.
You're a writer, you said.

17:13.207 --> 17:15.925
- Why?
- Are you or not?

17:16.087 --> 17:21.366
- That's what's on my Guild card.
- And you have written pictures?

17:21.527 --> 17:24.325
I sure have. Want a list of my credits?

17:24.487 --> 17:27.160
I want to ask you something.
Come in here.

17:27.327 --> 17:29.887
Last one was about
Okies in the Dust Bowl.

17:30.047 --> 17:32.003
You'd never know
because on screen

17:32.167 --> 17:35.443
the whole thing
played on a torpedo boat.

17:43.247 --> 17:45.636
Intimate, isn't it?

17:47.647 --> 17:51.037
The wind gets in that pipe organ.
I ought to take it out.

17:51.207 --> 17:53.277
I'd teach it a better tune.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.517
Young man, tell me something.

17:55.687 --> 17:59.362
How long is a movie script
these days? How many pages?

17:59.527 --> 18:01.563
Depends whether
it's "Donald Duck" or "Joan of Arc".

18:01.727 --> 18:07.085
This is to be a very important picture.
I've written it myself. Took me years.

18:07.247 --> 18:09.203
Looks like enough
for six important pictures.

18:09.367 --> 18:12.086
It's Salome's story.
I'll have DeMille direct.

18:12.567 --> 18:16.799
- DeMille?
- We made a lot of pictures together.

18:16.967 --> 18:20.926
- And you'll play Salome.
- Who else?

18:21.847 --> 18:24.122
I didn't know
you were planning a comeback.

18:24.287 --> 18:27.199
I hate that word. It's a return.

18:27.367 --> 18:31.645
A return to the millions who've never
forgiven me for deserting the screen.

18:31.807 --> 18:35.561
- Fair enough.
- Salome. What a woman.

18:35.727 --> 18:39.436
What a part. The princess
in love with a holy man.

18:39.607 --> 18:41.643
She dances the dance
of the seven veils.

18:41.807 --> 18:45.163
He rejects her, so she demands
his head on a golden tray.

18:45.327 --> 18:48.717
Kissing his cold, dead lips.

18:49.367 --> 18:52.882
- They'll love it in Pomona.
- They'll love it everyplace.

18:53.047 --> 18:55.481
Read the scene
just before she has him killed.

18:55.647 --> 18:57.842
Another writer
may steal your material.

18:58.007 --> 19:00.362
I'm not afraid. Read it.

19:00.527 --> 19:04.918
Bring something to drink.
Sit down. Is there enough light?

19:05.087 --> 19:09.638
- I've got 20-20 vision.
- I said sit down.

19:13.167 --> 19:15.920
<i>Well, I had no</i>
<i>pressing engagement.</i>

19:16.087 --> 19:18.965
<i>Except with those boys</i>
<i>from the finance office.</i>

19:19.127 --> 19:23.439
<i>And she; d mentioned</i>
<i>something to drink. Why not?</i>

19:23.607 --> 19:28.806
<i>Sometimes it; s interesting to see</i>
<i>just how bad bad writing can be.</i>

19:28.967 --> 19:31.640
<i>This promised to go the limit.</i>

19:31.807 --> 19:37.359
<i>What would a handwriting expert</i>
<i>make of her childish scrawl?</i>

19:38.727 --> 19:42.117
<i>Max wheeled in</i>
<i>some champagne and caviar.</i>

19:42.287 --> 19:47.486
<i>Later I found out Max was the only</i>
<i>other person in that grim castle.</i>

19:47.647 --> 19:51.162
<i>And I found out</i>
<i>a few other things about him.</i>

19:51.327 --> 19:54.842
<i>As for her, she sat coiled up</i>
<i>like a watch-spring,</i>

19:55.007 --> 19:57.760
<i>her cigarette clamped</i>
<i>in a curious holder.</i>

19:57.927 --> 20:00.885
<i>I could sense her watching me</i>
<i>through those dark glasses,</i>

20:01.047 --> 20:03.800
<i>defying me not to like what I read,</i>

20:03.967 --> 20:07.926
<i>or maybe begging me</i>
<i>in her own proud way to like it.</i>

20:08.087 --> 20:11.124
<i>It meant so much to her.</i>

20:16.607 --> 20:18.837
<i>It sure was a cosy set-up.</i>

20:19.007 --> 20:24.081
<i>That bundle of raw nerves and Max</i>
<i>and a dead monkey upstairs,</i>

20:24.247 --> 20:28.718
<i>and the wind wheezing through</i>
<i>that organ once in a while.</i>

20:34.967 --> 20:38.164
<i>Later on, just for comedy relief,</i>

20:38.327 --> 20:42.036
<i>the real guy arrived</i>
<i>with the baby coffin.</i>

20:42.207 --> 20:45.517
<i>It was all done with great dignity.</i>

20:45.687 --> 20:48.759
<i>He must have been</i>
<i>a very important chimp.</i>

20:48.927 --> 20:52.715
<i>The great-grandson</i>
<i>of King Kong maybe.</i>

20:55.047 --> 20:59.723
<i>It got to be eleven, and I felt</i>
<i>a little sick at my stomach,</i>

20:59.887 --> 21:03.766
<i>what with that sweet champagne</i>
<i>and that tripe l; d been reading,</i>

21:03.927 --> 21:08.079
<i>that silly hodgepodge</i>
<i>of melodramatic plots.</i>

21:08.247 --> 21:14.482
<i>However, by then, l; d started</i>
<i>concocting a little plot of my own.</i>

21:14.647 --> 21:18.845
- Well?
- This is fascinating.

21:19.007 --> 21:21.362
Of course it is.

21:22.407 --> 21:27.356
Maybe it's a little long and repetitious,
but you're not a professional writer.

21:27.527 --> 21:32.521
- I wrote that with my heart.
- Sure you did.

21:32.687 --> 21:34.803
That's what makes it great.

21:36.087 --> 21:40.603
- But it needs a little more dialogue.
- What for?

21:40.767 --> 21:44.919
- My eyes can say anything I want.
- It could use some shears.

21:45.087 --> 21:48.875
- I will not have it butchered.
- Of course not.

21:49.047 --> 21:53.325
But it ought to be organised, edited.
You can find somebody.

21:53.487 --> 21:57.241
Who? I'd have
to have somebody I could trust.

21:57.407 --> 21:59.921
When were you born?
What zodiac sign?

22:00.087 --> 22:03.124
- I don't know.
- What month?

22:03.287 --> 22:05.164
December, 21 st.

22:05.327 --> 22:08.717
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians,
you can trust them.

22:09.607 --> 22:12.519
- Thank you.
- I want you to do this work.

22:12.687 --> 22:18.478
Me? I'm busy. I just finished a script
and I'm doing another assignment.

22:18.647 --> 22:20.877
I don't care.

22:21.327 --> 22:25.479
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get $500 a week.

22:25.647 --> 22:29.845
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.

22:30.007 --> 22:33.920
- I'll read the rest at home.
- I couldn't let it out of my house.

22:34.087 --> 22:37.921
- Finish it here.
- It's getting kind of late.

22:39.047 --> 22:42.084
- Are you married, Mr?
- Gillis. Single.

22:42.247 --> 22:45.523
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. Alto Nido apartments.

22:45.687 --> 22:49.441
- Something's wrong with your car?
- There sure is.

22:49.607 --> 22:53.043
- Why not stay here?
- I'll come back early tomorrow.

22:53.207 --> 22:56.643
Nonsense.
There's a room over the garage.

22:56.807 --> 23:00.846
Max will take you there.
Max!

23:03.727 --> 23:07.766
<i>I felt kind of pleased</i>
<i>with the way l; d handled the situation.</i>

23:07.927 --> 23:11.078
<i>I dropped the hook,</i>
<i>and she snapped at it.</i>

23:11.247 --> 23:15.286
<i>My car would be safe down below</i>
<i>while I patched up the script.</i>

23:16.247 --> 23:19.637
<i>And there should be</i>
<i>plenty of money in it.</i>

23:23.807 --> 23:26.367
This room hasn't been
used for a long time.

23:26.527 --> 23:30.156
It'll never make "House Beautiful",
but it's OK for one night.

23:30.327 --> 23:36.323
- I made your bed this afternoon.
- How did you know I'd stay?

23:36.487 --> 23:41.607
The bathroom's there. I put in some
towels, soap and a toothbrush.

23:44.527 --> 23:48.725
Say, she's quite a character
that Norma Desmond.

23:48.887 --> 23:52.516
She was the greatest.
You wouldn't know, you're too young.

23:52.687 --> 23:56.157
In one week,
she received 17,000 fan letters.

23:56.327 --> 23:59.603
Men bribed the hairdresser
for a lock of her hair.

23:59.767 --> 24:04.682
There was an Indian maharajah who
came to beg one of her stockings.

24:04.847 --> 24:07.998
Later he strangled himself with it.

24:08.167 --> 24:11.603
Well, I sure turned
into an interesting driveway.

24:11.767 --> 24:14.964
You did, sir. Goodnight, sir.

24:20.207 --> 24:23.597
<i>I pegged him as slightly cuckoo, too.</i>

24:24.087 --> 24:26.601
<i>A stroke maybe.</i>

24:26.847 --> 24:32.763
<i>The whole place seemed stricken</i>
<i>with a creeping paralysis,</i>

24:32.927 --> 24:37.842
<i>out of beat with the rest of the world,</i>
<i>crumbling apart in slow motion.</i>

24:38.887 --> 24:43.756
<i>There was a tennis court,</i>
<i>or rather the ghost of a tennis court,</i>

24:43.927 --> 24:47.476
<i>with faded markings</i>
<i>and a sagging net.</i>

24:50.887 --> 24:55.403
<i>And, of course, she had a pool.</i>
<i>Who didn; t then?</i>

24:55.567 --> 25:00.721
<i>Mabel Normand and John Gilbert</i>
<i>swam in it 10,000 midnights ago.</i>

25:00.887 --> 25:04.516
<i>And Vilma Banky</i>
<i>and Rod La Rocque.</i>

25:04.687 --> 25:08.566
<i>It was empty now. Or was it?</i>

25:14.487 --> 25:21.279
<i>There was something else going on:</i>
<i>the last rites for that hairy old chimp,</i>

25:21.447 --> 25:24.757
<i>performed</i>
<i>with the utmost seriousness,</i>

25:24.927 --> 25:28.886
<i>as if she were laying to rest</i>
<i>an only child.</i>

25:29.607 --> 25:33.566
<i>Was her life really as empty as that?</i>

25:41.527 --> 25:46.555
<i>It was all very queer,</i>
<i>but queerer things were yet to come.</i>

25:54.527 --> 26:00.045
<i>That night I had a mixed-up dream.</i>
<i>In it there was an organ grinder.</i>

26:00.207 --> 26:03.916
<i>I couldn; t see his face,</i>
<i>but the organ was draped in black.</i>

26:04.087 --> 26:07.557
<i>And a chimp</i>
<i>was dancing for pennies.</i>

26:07.727 --> 26:11.925
<i>When I opened my eyes,</i>
<i>the music was still there.</i>

26:12.087 --> 26:14.043
<i>Where was I?</i>

26:15.487 --> 26:20.561
<i>Oh, yes, in that empty room</i>
<i>over her garage.</i>

26:20.727 --> 26:26.040
<i>Only it wasn; t empty any more.</i>
<i>l; d had a visitor.</i>

26:26.207 --> 26:30.997
<i>Someone had brought in my belongings,</i>
<i>my books, typewriter and clothes.</i>

26:32.487 --> 26:34.921
<i>What was going on?</i>

26:51.847 --> 26:57.126
Hey, you! Max, whatever your name
is, what are my things doing here?

26:57.287 --> 27:01.360
I'm talking to you. My clothes
and things are up in the room.

27:01.527 --> 27:05.406
Naturally. I brought them myself.

27:05.567 --> 27:10.118
- Is that so?
- What's the matter? Anything missing?

27:10.287 --> 27:14.075
- Who asked you to?
- I did.

27:14.247 --> 27:17.842
I don't know why you're so upset.
Stop that playing, Max.

27:18.007 --> 27:22.159
It seemed like a good idea
if we are to work together.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.686
I'm to fix your script. There's nothing
in the deal about staying here.

27:26.847 --> 27:29.964
- You'll like it here.
- I've my own apartment.

27:30.127 --> 27:32.402
You owe three months' rent.

27:32.567 --> 27:36.401
- I'll take care of that.
- It's all taken care of, all paid for.

27:38.767 --> 27:40.917
We'll deduct it from my salary.

27:41.607 --> 27:45.202
Let's not be small about such matters.
We won't keep books.

27:45.687 --> 27:50.317
- Unpack Mr Gillis's things.
- It is done, Madame.

27:50.487 --> 27:54.799
- Pack 'em up again. I'm not staying!
- Make up your mind.

27:54.967 --> 27:58.084
Do you want this job or don't you?

27:59.887 --> 28:03.562
<i>I wanted the job and the dough</i>
<i>and to get out of there quickly.</i>

28:05.687 --> 28:09.680
<i>I thought if I got going</i>
<i>I could finish it in a couple of weeks.</i>

28:09.847 --> 28:14.967
<i>But it wasn; t so simple getting</i>
<i>coherence into her wild hallucinations.</i>

28:15.127 --> 28:19.917
<i>It was made tougher with her</i>
<i>around all the time, hovering over me,</i>

28:20.087 --> 28:25.241
<i>afraid l; d do injury</i>
<i>to that precious brainchild of hers.</i>

28:29.967 --> 28:31.923
What's that?

28:32.087 --> 28:35.079
- Just a scene I threw out.
- Which scene?

28:35.247 --> 28:38.159
The slave market.
It's better to cut directly to...

28:38.327 --> 28:40.636
Cut away from me?

28:40.807 --> 28:44.163
It's too much of you.
They don't want you in every scene.

28:44.327 --> 28:49.162
Then why do they still write me fan
letters and beg for my photographs?

28:49.327 --> 28:53.115
Because they want to see me -
me, Norma Desmond.

28:53.287 --> 28:55.403
Put it back.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.320
OK.

29:10.167 --> 29:11.964
<i>I didn; t argue with her.</i>

29:12.127 --> 29:16.564
<i>You don; t yell at a sleepwalker.</i>
<i>He may fall and break his neck.</i>

29:16.727 --> 29:21.642
<i>That; s it. She was still sleepwalking</i>
<i>along the giddy heights of a lost career.</i>

29:21.807 --> 29:26.483
<i>Plain crazy when it came</i>
<i>to that one subject: her celluloid self.</i>

29:26.647 --> 29:28.956
<i>The great Norma Desmond.</i>

29:29.127 --> 29:33.439
<i>How could she breathe in that house</i>
<i>so crowded with Norma Desmonds?</i>

29:33.607 --> 29:39.762
<i>More Norma Desmonds</i>
<i>and still more Norma Desmonds.</i>

29:41.047 --> 29:43.277
<i>It wasn; t all work, of course.</i>

29:43.447 --> 29:46.883
<i>Three times a week,</i>
<i>Max hauled up that painting</i>

29:47.047 --> 29:50.005
<i>presented to her by some</i>
<i>Nevada chamber of commerce.</i>

29:50.807 --> 29:54.595
<i>And we; d see a movie,</i>
<i>right in her living room.</i>

29:54.767 --> 29:58.123
<i>So much nicer than going out,</i>
<i>she; d say.</i>

29:58.287 --> 30:02.166
<i>The plain fact was</i>
<i>she was afraid of that world outside,</i>

30:02.327 --> 30:06.320
<i>afraid it would remind her</i>
<i>that time had passed.</i>

30:07.447 --> 30:11.963
<i>They were silent movies, and Max</i>
<i>would run the projection machine.</i>

30:12.127 --> 30:13.879
<i>Just as well.</i>

30:14.047 --> 30:18.563
<i>It kept him from giving us</i>
<i>an accompaniment on that organ.</i>

30:20.167 --> 30:23.796
<i>She; d sit very close to me,</i>
<i>and she; d smell of tuberoses.</i>

30:23.967 --> 30:27.437
<i>Not my favourite perfume,</i>
<i>not by a long shot.</i>

30:27.607 --> 30:31.600
<i>Sometimes as we watched,</i>
<i>she; d clutch my arm or my hand,</i>

30:31.767 --> 30:33.837
<i>forgetting she was my employer,</i>

30:34.007 --> 30:39.923
<i>just becoming a fan, excited about</i>
<i>that actress up there on the screen.</i>

30:40.567 --> 30:44.003
<i>I don; t have to tell you</i>
<i>who the star was.</i>

30:44.167 --> 30:49.480
<i>They were always her pictures.</i>
<i>That; s all she wanted to see.</i>

31:13.727 --> 31:18.596
Still wonderful, isn't it?
And no dialogue.

31:18.767 --> 31:22.646
We didn't need dialogue.
We had faces.

31:22.807 --> 31:28.677
There just aren't any faces like
that any more. Maybe one, Garbo.

31:29.647 --> 31:34.437
Those idiot producers, those imbeciles!
Haven't they got eyes?

31:34.607 --> 31:37.201
Have they forgotten
what a star looks like?

31:37.367 --> 31:40.040
I'll be up there again, so help me!

31:49.887 --> 31:52.879
<i>Sometimes there; d be</i>
<i>a little bridge game.</i>

31:53.047 --> 31:57.165
<i>With a twentieth of a cent a point.</i>
<i>l; d get half her winnings.</i>

31:57.327 --> 32:02.799
<i>Once they ran up to 70 cents, which</i>
<i>was about the only cash I ever got.</i>

32:02.967 --> 32:05.720
<i>The other players</i>
<i>would be actor friends,</i>

32:05.887 --> 32:09.516
<i>dim figures you may still remember</i>
<i>from the silent days.</i>

32:09.687 --> 32:12.247
<i>I thought of them as her waxworks.</i>

32:12.407 --> 32:15.604
- One diamond.
- One heart.

32:17.367 --> 32:21.042
- A spade.
- Pass.

32:21.207 --> 32:24.324
- Three no trump.
- Pass.

32:24.487 --> 32:28.878
- Pass.
- Empty the ashtray, Joe, dear.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.801
- Some men outside ask for you.
- I'm not here.

32:57.967 --> 32:59.844
- That's what I said.
- Good.

33:00.007 --> 33:03.920
But they found your car and
they're going to tow it away.

33:04.087 --> 33:09.605
Where's the ashtray?
Joe, can't we have the ashtray?

33:14.967 --> 33:18.482
- I want to talk to you.
- Not now, I'm playing three no trump.

33:18.647 --> 33:20.638
They've come for my car.

33:20.807 --> 33:23.446
I've forgotten
how many spades are out!

33:23.607 --> 33:26.917
- I need money now.
- Can't you wait until I'm dummy?

33:27.087 --> 33:29.840
- No.
- Please.

34:03.047 --> 34:06.801
- Now, what is it? Where's the fire?
- I've lost my car.

34:06.967 --> 34:09.197
I thought it
was a matter of life and death.

34:09.367 --> 34:14.235
It is, to me. That's why I came to this
house and took this job, ghost-writing.

34:14.407 --> 34:17.922
You're being silly. We don't need
two cars, we have one.

34:18.087 --> 34:22.558
Not a cheap thing made of chromium
and spit: an Isotta Fraschini.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.195
Ever heard of Isotta Fraschinis?

34:25.367 --> 34:29.485
All handmade. Cost me $28,000.

34:31.607 --> 34:36.681
<i>So Max got that old bus</i>
<i>off its blocks and polished it up.</i>

34:36.847 --> 34:40.556
<i>She; d take me for rides</i>
<i>in the hills above Sunset.</i>

34:40.726 --> 34:43.605
<i>The whole thing</i>
<i>was upholstered in leopard skin,</i>

34:43.766 --> 34:47.396
<i>and had one of those car phones,</i>
<i>all gold-plated.</i>

34:49.567 --> 34:52.922
- That's a dreadful shirt.
- What's wrong with it?

34:53.087 --> 34:59.356
Nothing, for work in a filling station.
I'm bored with that jacket and pants.

35:00.887 --> 35:04.277
Max, what's the very best
man's shop in town?

35:04.447 --> 35:08.486
I don't need any clothes and
I don't want you buying them for me.

35:08.647 --> 35:12.879
Why begrudge me a little fun?
I just want you to look nice.

35:13.047 --> 35:16.244
And must you chew gum?

35:21.487 --> 35:24.638
There's nothing like
blue flannel for a man.

35:24.807 --> 35:26.604
This one, single-breasted.

35:26.767 --> 35:30.316
Now we need a topcoat.
Show me your camel's hair.

35:30.487 --> 35:33.081
- Evening clothes?
- I don't need a tuxedo.

35:33.247 --> 35:37.798
Of course you do. A tuxedo, tails
and, if you aren't careful, a cut-away.

35:37.967 --> 35:41.516
- Tails, that's ridiculous!
- For parties and New Year's Eve.

35:41.687 --> 35:45.362
- Where are your evening clothes?
- This way, madam.

35:48.247 --> 35:51.876
Here are some camel's hair,
but feel this, it's vicuña.

35:52.047 --> 35:56.484
- It's a little more expensive.
- The camel's hair will do.

35:57.487 --> 36:02.322
Well, as long as the lady's paying
for it, why not take the vicuña?

36:11.447 --> 36:14.803
<i>The last week in December,</i>
<i>the rains came.</i>

36:14.967 --> 36:21.281
<i>A great package of rain. Oversized</i>
<i>like everything else in California.</i>

36:21.447 --> 36:26.316
<i>It came right through the old roof</i>
<i>of my room above the garage.</i>

36:26.847 --> 36:29.805
<i>She had Max move me</i>
<i>to the main house.</i>

36:29.967 --> 36:32.356
<i>I didn; t much like the idea.</i>

36:32.527 --> 36:36.236
<i>The only time</i>
<i>I had to myself was in that room.</i>

36:36.407 --> 36:40.878
<i>But, it was better than sleeping</i>
<i>in a raincoat and galoshes.</i>

37:15.607 --> 37:19.680
- Whose room was this?
- The room of the husband.

37:19.847 --> 37:25.205
The husbands, I should say.
Madame's been married three times.

37:29.327 --> 37:35.084
I guess that's the one you can see
Catalina from, only this isn't the day.

37:46.967 --> 37:50.926
What's with the door?
There's no lock.

37:51.087 --> 37:55.399
There are no locks
anywhere in this house, sir.

37:59.647 --> 38:02.878
How come? There must be a reason.

38:03.047 --> 38:05.607
- The doctor suggested it.
- What doctor?

38:05.767 --> 38:10.716
Madame's doctor. Madame
has moments of melancholy.

38:10.887 --> 38:14.436
There have been
some attempts at suicide.

38:14.607 --> 38:18.316
We have to be very careful.
No sleeping pills, no razor blades.

38:18.487 --> 38:22.002
We shut off the gas
in Madame's bedroom.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.842
Why? Her career? She got enough
out of it. She's not forgotten.

38:26.007 --> 38:32.401
- She still gets those fan letters.
- Don't look closely at the postmarks.

38:33.607 --> 38:36.883
You send them. Is that it, Max?

38:37.047 --> 38:39.641
I'd better press
your evening clothes, sir.

38:39.807 --> 38:44.085
Mr Gillis has not forgotten
Madame's New Year's party?

38:44.247 --> 38:48.445
No, I haven't. I suppose
all the waxworks are coming?

38:48.607 --> 38:53.442
I wouldn't know, sir.
Madame made the arrangements.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.638
<i>There it was again.</i>

39:12.807 --> 39:17.005
<i>That room of hers.</i>
<i>All satin and ruffles.</i>

39:17.167 --> 39:19.761
<i>And that bed like a gilded rowboat.</i>

39:19.927 --> 39:25.638
<i>The perfect setting</i>
<i>for a silent movie queen. Poor devil.</i>

39:25.807 --> 39:30.801
<i>Still waving proudly to a parade</i>
<i>which had long since passed her by.</i>

39:33.807 --> 39:38.198
<i>It was at her New Year; s party that</i>
<i>I found out how she felt about me.</i>

39:38.367 --> 39:41.962
<i>Maybe l; d been an idiot</i>
<i>not to have sensed it was coming.</i>

39:42.127 --> 39:45.722
<i>That sad, embarrassing revelation.</i>

39:49.847 --> 39:52.156
Joe!

39:56.447 --> 40:00.406
You look absolutely divine.
Turn around.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.364
- Please!
- Come on.

40:02.527 --> 40:06.315
Perfect! Wonderful shoulders,
and I love that line.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.842
- It's padding, don't be fooled.
- Here.

40:09.527 --> 40:12.439
Dressing up was always
just wearing my dark blue suit.

40:12.607 --> 40:16.156
I don't like the stud.
I want you to have a luscious pearl.

40:16.327 --> 40:18.443
I'm not going to wear earrings.

40:19.647 --> 40:22.844
- Let's have a drink.
- Shouldn't we wait for the others?

40:23.007 --> 40:24.440
Max, champagne.

40:25.527 --> 40:28.439
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.

40:30.247 --> 40:35.879
Here's to us! This floor
used to be wood, but I had it changed.

40:36.047 --> 40:41.724
Valentino said, "There's nothing
like tile for a tango." Come on.

40:41.887 --> 40:46.324
- Not on the same floor with Valentino.
- Just follow me.

41:02.807 --> 41:06.846
- Don't bend back like that.
- It's that thing, it tickles.

41:07.007 --> 41:08.998
It does?

41:32.567 --> 41:36.242
- It's 10.15. What time will they arrive?
- Who?

41:36.407 --> 41:38.602
- The other guests.
- There aren't any.

41:38.767 --> 41:43.283
We don't want to share this night
with others. This is for you and me.

41:43.447 --> 41:46.200
- Oh?
- Hold me tighter.

41:46.367 --> 41:47.686
OK.

41:49.127 --> 41:54.485
Come midnight, how about
smashing glasses over Max's head?

41:54.647 --> 41:58.162
- You think this is funny.
- A little.

42:05.367 --> 42:08.279
<i>An hour dragged by.</i>

42:08.447 --> 42:13.726
<i>I felt caught like the cigarette</i>
<i>in that contraption on her finger.</i>

42:17.167 --> 42:22.161
What a wonderful next year
it's going to be. What fun we'll have.

42:22.327 --> 42:27.003
I'll fill the pool or open my Malibu
house and you can have the ocean.

42:27.167 --> 42:31.763
When our picture's finished, I'll buy
you a boat and we'll sail to Hawaii...

42:31.927 --> 42:33.838
You won't buy me anything more.

42:34.007 --> 42:39.240
Don't be silly. Here. I was going
to give it to you at midnight.

42:41.367 --> 42:43.403
I can't take it.
You've bought me enough.

42:43.567 --> 42:48.561
Shut up! I'm rich, richer than
all this new Hollywood trash.

42:48.727 --> 42:50.445
I've got $1 million.

42:50.607 --> 42:57.922
I own three blocks downtown, I've got
oil in Bakersfield pumping, pumping.

42:58.087 --> 43:00.396
It's for buying us anything we want.

43:00.567 --> 43:04.560
- Cut out that "us" business.
- What's the matter with you?

43:04.727 --> 43:08.117
What right do you have
to take me for granted?

43:08.287 --> 43:11.120
What right? You want me to tell you?

43:13.047 --> 43:18.326
Have you thought I may have a life
of my own, a girl I'm crazy about?

43:19.127 --> 43:22.642
Who? Some car-hop or dress extra?

43:22.807 --> 43:25.241
I'm all wrong for you.

43:25.407 --> 43:29.002
You want a Valentino, somebody
with polo ponies, a big shot.

43:29.167 --> 43:35.606
What you're trying to say is you
don't want me to love you. Say it.

44:48.487 --> 44:52.924
<i>I didn; t know where I was going.</i>
<i>I just had to get out of there.</i>

44:53.087 --> 44:58.957
<i>I had to be with people my own age.</i>
<i>I had to hear somebody laugh again.</i>

45:00.167 --> 45:01.964
<i>I thought of Artie Green.</i>

45:02.127 --> 45:06.518
<i>There had to be a New Year; s
<i>shindig in his apartment.</i></i>

45:06.687 --> 45:10.396
<i>Writers without a job,</i>
<i>composers without a publisher,</i>

45:10.567 --> 45:14.560
<i>actresses so young they still</i>
<i>believed the guys in the casting office.</i>

45:14.727 --> 45:19.721
<i>A bunch of kids who didn; t give a hoot,</i>
<i>so long as they had a yuck to share.</i>

45:21.127 --> 45:25.200
<i>Hollywood for us ain; t been so good</i>
<i>Got no swimming pool</i>

45:25.367 --> 45:32.079
<i>Very few clothes</i>
<i>All we earn are buttons and bows</i>

45:33.407 --> 45:34.965
- Hello, Joe.
- Tom.

45:35.127 --> 45:38.199
- How are you?
- Hi, Joe.

45:40.087 --> 45:42.726
- Whaddya know, Joe Gillis!
- Hi, Artie.

45:42.887 --> 45:47.915
Where you been keeping that gorgeous
face? I almost reported you missing.

45:48.087 --> 45:51.796
You all know Joe Gillis, the famous
screenwriter, uranium smuggler,

45:51.967 --> 45:54.276
and Black Dahlia suspect.

45:55.247 --> 45:57.522
- Give me your coat.
- Let it ride.

45:57.687 --> 45:59.917
- You are going to stay?
- Yes.

46:00.087 --> 46:03.796
Then come on. What is this, mink?

46:05.447 --> 46:10.362
Judas H Priest, who'd you borrow
that from? Adolphe Menjou?

46:10.527 --> 46:13.678
- Close, but no cigar.
- You're not really a smuggler?

46:13.847 --> 46:16.361
- Where's the bar?
- Come on.

46:19.127 --> 46:20.640
- Good party.
- The greatest.

46:20.807 --> 46:23.446
They call me the Elsa Maxwell
of the assistant directors.

46:23.607 --> 46:28.237
Go easy on that punchbowl. Budget
only calls for three drinks per extra.

46:28.407 --> 46:31.524
- Fake the rest.
- Can I stick around a while?

46:31.687 --> 46:35.316
- Sure. This'll go on all night.
- No, I mean a couple of weeks?

46:35.487 --> 46:38.160
- We've a vacancy on the couch.
- I'll take it.

46:38.327 --> 46:43.606
I'll have the bellhop take care
of your luggage. Just register it here.

46:45.007 --> 46:46.963
- Hello, Mr Gillis.
- Hello.

46:47.127 --> 46:50.802
- You know each other?
- Betty Schaefer, Sheldrake's office.

46:50.967 --> 46:53.527
- Sure, "Bases Loaded".
- Wait.

46:53.687 --> 46:56.440
This is the woman I love.
What's going on?

46:56.607 --> 46:58.916
She's a fan for my literary output.

46:59.087 --> 47:01.647
- Hurt feelings department.
- Where's the phone?

47:01.807 --> 47:04.196
Over by the rainbow room.

47:12.967 --> 47:16.676
When you're through
with that thing, can I have it?

47:19.607 --> 47:22.804
- Hey, you forgot this.
- Thanks.

47:22.967 --> 47:27.802
- I've been hoping to run into you.
- To recover your knife in my back?

47:27.967 --> 47:30.959
I felt guilty, so I got out
some of your old stories.

47:31.127 --> 47:35.245
- You sweet kid.
- One's called something "Window".

47:35.407 --> 47:40.162
- "Dark Windows". How'd you like it?
- I didn't, except for about six pages.

47:40.327 --> 47:42.795
You've got a flashback there...

47:42.967 --> 47:45.527
Is there someplace we can talk?

47:45.687 --> 47:48.281
How about the rainbow room?

47:48.807 --> 47:52.686
Joe, I said you could
have my couch, not my girl.

47:52.847 --> 47:54.758
This is shop talk.

47:55.727 --> 47:59.720
There's a short stretch of my fiction
you found worthy of notice?

47:59.887 --> 48:02.959
The flashback scene when she tells
about being a schoolteacher.

48:03.127 --> 48:06.483
- I had a teacher like that.
- Maybe that's why it's good.

48:06.647 --> 48:10.481
- It's true and moving. Why not?
- Who wants true and moving?

48:10.647 --> 48:13.320
Drop that attitude.
It's something worthwhile.

48:13.487 --> 48:16.718
- Shall I start now?
- Seriously. I've got ideas.

48:16.887 --> 48:21.244
I've got some, too.
This is New Year's Eve, let's live it up.

48:21.407 --> 48:25.685
For instance? We could make some
paper boats and have a regatta.

48:25.847 --> 48:29.806
- Or turn on the shower full blast.
- Or capture the kitchen.

48:29.967 --> 48:32.401
- Are you hungry?
- Hungry?

48:32.567 --> 48:36.640
After twelve years in the Burmese
jungle, I'm starving, Lady Agatha...

48:36.807 --> 48:40.402
...starving for a white shoulder.
- Phillip, you're mad.

48:40.567 --> 48:44.606
Thirsting for the coolness of your lips.

48:45.047 --> 48:48.084
You can have the phone now.

48:48.647 --> 48:50.842
No, Phillip, we must be strong.

48:51.007 --> 48:53.077
You're still wearing
the Coldstream Guards uniform,

48:53.247 --> 48:56.045
furthermore,
you can have the phone now.

48:56.207 --> 48:58.323
OK.

48:58.487 --> 49:00.876
Suddenly
I'm terribly afraid of losing you.

49:01.047 --> 49:04.437
You won't. I'll get us a refill
of this horrible liquid.

49:04.607 --> 49:08.395
- You'll be waiting for me?
- With a wildly beating heart.

49:08.567 --> 49:12.446
Life can be beautiful.

49:30.407 --> 49:33.046
Hello, Max. I need a favour.

49:33.807 --> 49:36.367
I'm sorry, I cannot talk now.

49:36.527 --> 49:42.124
Yes, you can. Put my old clothes
and my typewriter in my suitcase.

49:42.287 --> 49:47.486
- I'll have somebody pick them up.
- I've no time. The doctor is here.

49:48.607 --> 49:50.484
What doctor? What's going on?

49:50.647 --> 49:54.799
Madame got the razor
from your room and cut her wrists.

49:54.967 --> 49:58.482
What? Max! Max!

50:08.887 --> 50:10.320
I got the recipe.

50:10.487 --> 50:15.561
Two packages of cough drops
dissolved in warm grape juice...

50:21.847 --> 50:23.485
Hey, Joe!

50:31.207 --> 50:33.323
Happy New Year!

50:37.367 --> 50:40.245
- How is she?
- She's in her room.

50:40.407 --> 50:45.527
Be careful, don't race upstairs.
The musicians mustn't know.

51:27.807 --> 51:29.923
Go away.

51:38.927 --> 51:41.202
What silly thing was that to do?

51:41.367 --> 51:45.326
To fall in love
with you was the idiotic thing.

51:46.487 --> 51:49.240
Sure would've
made attractive headlines.

51:49.407 --> 51:51.762
"Great star kills herself
for unknown writer."

51:52.567 --> 51:56.799
Great stars have great pride.

52:01.087 --> 52:05.399
Go away. Go to that girl of yours.

52:09.487 --> 52:12.160
Look, I was making that up,

52:12.327 --> 52:16.002
because I thought
the whole thing was a mistake.

52:16.247 --> 52:19.956
I didn't want to hurt you.
You've been good to me.

52:20.127 --> 52:23.802
You're the only person
in this stinking town that has.

52:23.967 --> 52:27.198
Just say thank you and go.
Go, go!

52:27.367 --> 52:31.758
Not until you promise to act
like a sensible human being.

52:31.927 --> 52:34.999
I'll do it again. I'll do it again!

52:37.047 --> 52:40.084
I'll do it again.

53:29.007 --> 53:31.282
Happy New Year, Norma.

53:41.327 --> 53:44.637
Happy New Year, darling.

54:00.727 --> 54:05.278
- Hello.
- Is this Crest View 51733?

54:05.447 --> 54:09.645
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but I must speak to Mr Gillis.

54:09.807 --> 54:13.004
- He's not here.
- Where can I reach him?

54:13.167 --> 54:17.922
- Maybe somebody else could tell me.
- Nobody can give you any information.

54:18.087 --> 54:21.875
And you will please not call again.

54:22.847 --> 54:25.202
Max!

54:26.487 --> 54:29.957
Who was it, Max? What is it?

54:30.927 --> 54:35.842
Nothing, Madame. Somebody
enquiring about a stray dog.

54:36.007 --> 54:39.636
Our number must be similar
to the number of the pound.

54:40.407 --> 54:44.605
Wait. Get the car out
and take the script to Paramount.

54:44.767 --> 54:48.362
- Deliver it to Mr DeMille in person.
- Very good.

54:53.967 --> 54:57.516
- You're sending it to DeMille?
- Yes. This is the day.

54:57.687 --> 55:00.759
My astrologer read
DeMille's horoscope and mine.

55:00.927 --> 55:03.441
- She read the script?
- DeMille's Leo, I'm Scorpio.

55:03.607 --> 55:05.677
Mars has been transiting
Jupiter for weeks.

55:05.847 --> 55:09.681
Today is the day
of the greatest conjunction.

55:09.847 --> 55:12.805
Turn around, darling. Let me dry you.

55:14.927 --> 55:18.317
I hope you realise scripts don't sell
on astrologers' charts.

55:18.487 --> 55:20.557
It's not the script, I'm selling me.

55:20.727 --> 55:23.400
DeMille always said
I was his greatest star.

55:23.567 --> 55:26.240
When did he say it, Norma?

55:26.407 --> 55:31.276
All right, it was quite a few years ago.
But I've never looked better in my life.

55:31.447 --> 55:36.840
You know why? Because
I've never been as happy in my life.

55:39.607 --> 55:44.556
<i>A few evenings later, we were visiting</i>
<i>one of the waxworks for bridge.</i>

55:44.727 --> 55:50.165
<i>She; d taught me bridge by then, just</i>
<i>as she; d taught me fancy tango steps,</i>

55:50.327 --> 55:54.320
<i>and what wine to drink with what fish.</i>

55:55.287 --> 55:58.643
That idiot! He forgot
to fill my cigarette case.

55:58.807 --> 56:03.278
- Have one of mine.
- They're dreadful and make me cough.

56:06.007 --> 56:09.079
Pull up at the drugstore.
I'll get you some.

56:09.247 --> 56:11.761
You're a darling.

56:31.847 --> 56:36.204
Give me a package of those
Turkish cigarettes... Abdullas.

56:37.607 --> 56:41.361
Stick 'em up, Gillis,
or I'll let you have it.

56:42.687 --> 56:44.439
Hi, Artie. Evening, Miss Schaefer.

56:44.607 --> 56:48.566
- I'm so glad to see you.
- You walked out on the mob?

56:48.727 --> 56:52.322
Sorry about New Year's. Would you
believe I stayed with a sick friend?

56:52.487 --> 56:55.684
Someone in the formal set,
with a ten-carat kidney stone?

56:55.847 --> 56:58.805
Stop it. Where've you been
keeping yourself?

56:58.967 --> 57:04.121
- I've got wonderful news for you.
- I haven't been keeping myself at all.

57:04.287 --> 57:06.755
I called your agent,
the Screenwriters' Guild.

57:06.927 --> 57:09.077
Your apartment gave me
a Crest View number.

57:09.247 --> 57:13.206
There was someone with an accent
growling: you weren't there,

57:13.367 --> 57:14.959
they never heard of you.

57:15.127 --> 57:17.800
Is that so?
What's the wonderful news?

57:17.967 --> 57:20.720
- Sheldrake likes the teacher angle.
- What teacher?

57:20.887 --> 57:24.402
"Dark Windows". He thinks
it could be made into something.

57:24.567 --> 57:27.479
- Where's the cash?
- Where's the story?

57:27.647 --> 57:30.320
I bluffed it out with a few notions.

57:30.487 --> 57:32.398
- But it needs work.
- I feared so.

57:32.567 --> 57:35.479
I've got 20 pages
and a good male character.

57:35.647 --> 57:38.684
Write plenty of background
so they'll need an extra director.

57:38.847 --> 57:42.157
Shut up.
If we could get a story...

57:42.327 --> 57:45.205
I've given up writing on spec.

57:45.367 --> 57:49.042
- But this is half sold.
- In fact, I've given up writing.

57:49.207 --> 57:54.804
- Mr Gillis, if you please?
- I'll be right there.

57:54.967 --> 57:58.277
The accent! This guy's in the pay
of a foreign government.

57:58.447 --> 58:01.359
- Check those studs and cufflinks.
- I must go.

58:01.527 --> 58:05.440
- Thanks for the interest in my career.
- It's not yours, it's mine.

58:05.607 --> 58:07.598
I'd hoped to get in on this deal.

58:07.767 --> 58:10.839
I don't want to be a reader.
I want to write.

58:11.007 --> 58:14.158
- I'm sorry if I crossed you up.
- You sure have.

58:14.327 --> 58:16.363
So long.

58:26.047 --> 58:30.040
- It took you hours.
- I ran into some people I know.

58:30.207 --> 58:33.961
- Where are my cigarettes?
- Where are your?

58:35.047 --> 58:37.607
Norma, you're smoking too much.

58:40.287 --> 58:43.120
<i>Whenever she suspected</i>
<i>I was getting bored,</i>

58:43.287 --> 58:45.721
<i>she; d put on a live show for me.</i>

58:45.887 --> 58:48.196
<i>The Norma Desmond Follies.</i>

58:48.367 --> 58:52.440
<i>Her first number was always</i>
<i>the Mack Sennett Bathing Beauty.</i>

59:00.327 --> 59:05.003
I can still see myself in the line:
Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand.

59:05.167 --> 59:07.556
Mabel was always
stepping on my feet.

59:07.727 --> 59:11.276
What's the matter?
Why are you so glum?

59:11.447 --> 59:15.281
Nothing's the matter. I'm having
a great time. Show me some more.

59:15.447 --> 59:21.886
All right. Give me this. I need it for
a moustache. Now, close your eyes.

59:27.807 --> 59:30.446
<i>Something was the matter all right.</i>

59:30.607 --> 59:35.123
<i>I was thinking about that girl</i>
<i>of Artie; s, that Miss Schaefer.</i>

59:35.287 --> 59:38.836
<i>She was like all writers</i>
<i>when we first hit Hollywood,</i>

59:39.007 --> 59:42.886
<i>itching with ambition,</i>
<i>planning to get your names up there:</i>

59:43.047 --> 59:47.245
<i>; ; Screenplay by; ;, ; ; Original story by;; .</i>

59:49.047 --> 59:52.926
<i>Audiences don; t know somebody</i>
<i>sits down and writes a picture.</i>

59:53.087 --> 59:56.477
<i>They think the actors</i>
<i>make it up as they go.</i>

59:56.647 --> 59:59.923
Open your eyes.

01:00:31.287 --> 01:00:34.802
- Madame's wanted on the telephone.
- Don't interrupt me.

01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:36.844
- Paramount's calling.
- Who?

01:00:37.007 --> 01:00:39.601
Paramount Studios.

01:00:39.767 --> 01:00:43.442
Now do you believe me?
I told you DeMille would jump at it.

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:47.646
It is not Mr DeMille in person,
it's someone named Gordon Cole.

01:00:47.807 --> 01:00:50.560
- He says it's very important.
- Certainly it is.

01:00:50.727 --> 01:00:52.718
Important enough for Mr DeMille
to call me personally.

01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:57.517
The idea of having some assistant
call me! Say I'm busy and hang up.

01:00:57.687 --> 01:01:00.042
Very good, Madame.

01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:08.717
How do you like that?
We've made 12 pictures together.

01:01:08.887 --> 01:01:10.764
His greatest successes!

01:01:10.927 --> 01:01:13.999
- Maybe he's busy shooting.
- I know that trick!

01:01:14.167 --> 01:01:17.477
He's trying to belittle me,
to get my price down.

01:01:17.647 --> 01:01:23.119
I've waited 20 years for this.
DeMille can wait till I'm good and ready.

01:01:26.727 --> 01:01:29.958
<i>About three days later,</i>
<i>she was good and ready.</i>

01:01:30.127 --> 01:01:32.516
<i>Incredibly, there; d been some more</i>

01:01:32.687 --> 01:01:35.645
<i>of those urgent calls</i>
<i>from Paramount.</i>

01:01:35.807 --> 01:01:40.039
<i>So she put on about half a pound</i>
<i>of make-up, fixed it up with a veil,</i>

01:01:40.207 --> 01:01:43.597
<i>and set forth</i>
<i>to see DeMille in person.</i>

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:51.124
Madame will pardon me, the shadow
over the left eye is not quite balanced.

01:01:51.287 --> 01:01:53.562
Thank you, Max.

01:02:07.087 --> 01:02:09.726
Hold that noise!

01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:13.876
- Hey!
- To see Mr DeMille, open the gate.

01:02:14.047 --> 01:02:16.402
He's shooting. Got an appointment?

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.444
No appointment necessary.

01:02:18.607 --> 01:02:21.838
- I'm bringing Norma Desmond.
- Norma who?

01:02:22.007 --> 01:02:26.319
- Norma Desmond.
- Jonesy, hey, Jonesy.

01:02:26.487 --> 01:02:31.607
Yeah? Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond!

01:02:31.767 --> 01:02:34.804
- How've you been, Miss Desmond?
- Open the gate.

01:02:34.967 --> 01:02:39.040
- Sure, Miss Desmond. Come on.
- They can't enter without a pass.

01:02:39.207 --> 01:02:42.279
Miss Desmond can. Come on.

01:02:51.207 --> 01:02:53.675
- Where's Mr DeMille shooting?
- Stage 18.

01:02:53.847 --> 01:02:56.998
Thank you, Jonesy.
And teach your friend some manners.

01:02:57.167 --> 01:03:00.876
Without me he'd have no job,
because there'd be no Paramount.

01:03:01.047 --> 01:03:05.325
- You're right, Miss Desmond.
- Go on, Max.

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:13.726
Stage 18.

01:03:14.647 --> 01:03:20.677
<i>All right, notify Henry Wilcoxon.</i>
<i>Spread that out so I can see it.</i>

01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:24.637
<i>Keep quiet back there!</i>

01:03:24.807 --> 01:03:27.640
Norma Desmond's
coming to see Mr DeMille.

01:03:27.807 --> 01:03:32.085
<i>Hit that with a light, somebody,</i>
<i>so I can get a look at that scape.</i>

01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:36.684
<i>Back up a little. Get out of the way!</i>
<i>You fellow at the back.</i>

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.917
Norma Desmond's
coming to see Mr DeMille.

01:03:39.087 --> 01:03:41.476
Norma Desmond?

01:03:42.247 --> 01:03:44.966
- Wait a minute.
- Harry Wilcoxon?

01:03:45.127 --> 01:03:49.757
Draw your sword and raise that drape
with it. Samson's lying over here.

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:53.317
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see you, Mr DeMille.

01:03:53.487 --> 01:03:57.036
- Norma Desmond?
- She must be a million years old.

01:03:57.207 --> 01:04:00.563
Where does that put me?
I could be her father.

01:04:00.727 --> 01:04:05.642
- Sorry, Mr DeMille.
- It must be about her awful script.

01:04:05.807 --> 01:04:07.957
What can I tell her?

01:04:08.127 --> 01:04:12.245
I can tell her you're in the projection
room, give her the brush.

01:04:12.407 --> 01:04:15.638
Thirty million fans gave her
the brush. Isn't that enough?

01:04:15.807 --> 01:04:18.002
- I didn't mean...
- Of course not.

01:04:18.167 --> 01:04:22.160
You didn't know Norma Desmond
as a lovely girl of 17,

01:04:22.327 --> 01:04:26.923
with more courage and wit and heart
than ever in one youngster.

01:04:27.087 --> 01:04:31.285
- I hear she was a terror to work with.
- Only toward the end.

01:04:31.447 --> 01:04:34.837
A dozen press agents
working overtime

01:04:35.007 --> 01:04:38.795
can do terrible things
to the human spirit.

01:04:39.767 --> 01:04:41.405
Hold it.

01:04:47.127 --> 01:04:50.961
- Don't you want to come along?
- It's your script, your show.

01:04:51.127 --> 01:04:54.005
- Good luck.
- Thank you, dearest.

01:04:56.967 --> 01:04:58.844
Well, hello, young fellow.

01:04:59.007 --> 01:05:01.965
- Hello, Mr DeMille.
- Good to see you.

01:05:02.127 --> 01:05:04.561
I saw you last someplace very gay.

01:05:04.727 --> 01:05:07.287
I remember I was dancing on a table.

01:05:07.447 --> 01:05:12.885
A lot of people were. Lindbergh
had just landed in Paris. Come on in.

01:05:14.767 --> 01:05:17.998
Norma, I must apologise
for not calling you.

01:05:18.167 --> 01:05:19.759
You'd better, I'm very angry.

01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:23.237
- You can see I'm terribly busy.
- That's no excuse.

01:05:23.407 --> 01:05:26.797
- You read the script, of course?
- Yes.

01:05:26.967 --> 01:05:31.119
You could've called me yourself,
instead of leaving it to an assistant.

01:05:31.287 --> 01:05:36.202
- What assistant?
- Don't play innocent. Gordon Cole.

01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:37.686
Gordon Cole?

01:05:37.847 --> 01:05:40.236
If you hadn't been pretty interested,

01:05:40.407 --> 01:05:45.606
he wouldn't have tried to get me
on the telephone ten times.

01:05:45.767 --> 01:05:47.997
I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.

01:05:48.167 --> 01:05:52.399
Why don't you sit in my chair
and make yourself comfortable?

01:05:52.567 --> 01:05:57.357
- Thank you.
- That's the girl. I won't be a moment.

01:05:57.527 --> 01:06:01.520
Bring me a telephone
and get me Gordon Cole.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:18.964
Hey, Miss Desmond.

01:06:19.607 --> 01:06:26.445
- Miss Desmond, it's me, Hog-eye.
- Hello, Hog-eye.

01:06:29.127 --> 01:06:32.164
Let's get a good look at you.

01:06:34.207 --> 01:06:36.118
Look, there's Norma Desmond.

01:06:36.287 --> 01:06:38.926
Norma Desmond!

01:06:39.087 --> 01:06:41.521
- Norma Desmond!
- I thought she was dead.

01:06:41.687 --> 01:06:45.202
- How nice to see you!
- Welcome home. Remember me?

01:06:45.367 --> 01:06:48.677
Of course I do. Hello, Patsy.

01:06:48.847 --> 01:06:52.522
- Have you met Miss Desmond?
- It's a great pleasure.

01:06:52.687 --> 01:06:56.919
Gordon, this is C B DeMille. Have
you been calling Norma Desmond?

01:06:57.087 --> 01:07:01.205
Yes, Mr DeMille. It's that car of hers,
an old Isotta Fraschini.

01:07:01.367 --> 01:07:05.042
Her chauffeur drove it here the other
day. It's perfect for the Crosby picture.

01:07:05.207 --> 01:07:10.406
- We want to rent it for two weeks.
- Oh, I see.

01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:13.525
Well, thank you very much,
thank you.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:32.484
Hog-eye,
turn that light back where it belongs.

01:07:45.927 --> 01:07:49.203
Well, I got hold of Gordon Cole.

01:07:49.367 --> 01:07:51.801
Did you see how they came?

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:56.597
You know, some crazy things
happen in this business, Norma.

01:07:56.767 --> 01:08:00.601
I hope you haven't lost
your sense of humour.

01:08:00.767 --> 01:08:03.281
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:07.281
I didn't realise what it would be like
coming back to the studio.

01:08:07.447 --> 01:08:11.122
- I'd no idea how much I missed it.
- We've missed you, too.

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:14.279
We'll be working again.
We'll make our greatest picture.

01:08:14.447 --> 01:08:17.917
- I want to talk to you about that.
- Isn't it a good script?

01:08:18.087 --> 01:08:23.719
It has some good things in it, but
it would be a very expensive picture.

01:08:23.886 --> 01:08:25.684
I don't care.

01:08:25.846 --> 01:08:30.158
I want to work again. You don't know
what it means knowing you want me.

01:08:30.327 --> 01:08:34.115
Nothing would please me more
if it were possible.

01:08:34.287 --> 01:08:38.041
Remember, I don't work before
10 a.m. and never after 4.30 p.m.

01:08:38.846 --> 01:08:41.997
- We're ready, Mr DeMille.
- All right.

01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:49.163
Why don't you sit here and watch?
Pictures have changed quite a bit.

01:08:49.327 --> 01:08:51.397
All right, let's go.

01:08:51.767 --> 01:08:53.883
Hit 'em all.

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:58.443
Roll 'em. Speed.

01:09:06.807 --> 01:09:10.004
You see those offices there, Mr Gillis?

01:09:11.127 --> 01:09:15.200
They used to be Madame's
dressing-room. The whole row.

01:09:15.447 --> 01:09:17.517
That didn't leave much
for Wallace Reid.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:20.599
He had a great
big bungalow on wheels.

01:09:20.767 --> 01:09:25.886
I had the upstairs. You see where it
says "Readers Department"?

01:09:26.046 --> 01:09:30.962
I remember my walls were
covered with black patent leather.

01:09:38.327 --> 01:09:41.080
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:09:52.287 --> 01:09:56.803
Here's that funny car Cole was
talking about. Can we look it over?

01:09:56.967 --> 01:09:59.640
What's so funny about it?

01:10:05.567 --> 01:10:10.277
If there's anything in "Dark Windows"
you can use, take it, it's all yours.

01:10:10.447 --> 01:10:13.325
For heaven's sakes!
Come in, have a chair.

01:10:13.487 --> 01:10:17.275
- I mean it. Help yourself.
- Why should you do that?

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:21.565
You get $100,000, buy me chocolates;
an Oscar, I get the left foot.

01:10:21.727 --> 01:10:25.561
I would do that, but I'm not
good enough to do it alone.

01:10:25.727 --> 01:10:29.800
- What about those ideas you had?
- See if they make sense.

01:10:29.967 --> 01:10:34.324
First, throw out all that psychological
mess, exploring the killer's sick mind.

01:10:34.847 --> 01:10:36.565
Psychopaths sell like hot cakes.

01:10:36.727 --> 01:10:39.639
This is a story about teachers,
their threadbare lives.

01:10:39.807 --> 01:10:43.038
She teaches day classes
while he teaches night school.

01:10:43.207 --> 01:10:45.004
The first time they meet...

01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:48.045
- I haven't time to listen.
- I'll make it short.

01:10:48.207 --> 01:10:51.040
- It's your baby.
- Couldn't we work evenings?

01:10:51.207 --> 01:10:54.722
Six in the morning? This month
I'm completely at your disposal.

01:10:54.887 --> 01:10:57.845
- Artie's out of town.
- What's Artie to do with it?

01:10:58.007 --> 01:11:01.716
- We're engaged.
- Good for you.

01:11:01.887 --> 01:11:04.401
- You couldn't find a nicer guy.
- I agree.

01:11:04.567 --> 01:11:07.320
They're on location in Arizona
making a Western.

01:11:07.487 --> 01:11:12.515
I'm free every evening and weekend.
We could work at your place.

01:11:12.687 --> 01:11:16.885
It can't be done. Stop being
chicken-hearted and write that story.

01:11:17.047 --> 01:11:19.925
- I hate you.
- Don't make it too dreary.

01:11:20.087 --> 01:11:23.682
How about this? She teaches
daytimes, he teaches at night.

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:27.476
They don't know each other
but share a room. It's cheaper.

01:11:27.647 --> 01:11:31.765
They sleep in the same bed.
In shifts, of course.

01:11:31.927 --> 01:11:34.760
Are you kidding? I think it's good.

01:11:34.927 --> 01:11:37.919
- So do I.
- Let me show you where it fits in.

01:11:38.087 --> 01:11:40.999
- So long.
- Oh, you...

01:11:46.127 --> 01:11:47.446
What?

01:11:47.607 --> 01:11:51.520
I found out the reason for those
telephone calls from Paramount.

01:11:51.687 --> 01:11:55.566
It's not Madame they want,
it's her car they want to rent.

01:11:55.727 --> 01:11:57.843
What?

01:12:00.007 --> 01:12:03.124
Goodbye, Norma.
We'll see what we can do.

01:12:03.287 --> 01:12:07.917
I'm not worried. The old team
together again. Nothing can stop us.

01:12:08.087 --> 01:12:11.124
The old team? Yeah.

01:12:12.167 --> 01:12:15.159
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mr DeMille.

01:12:23.287 --> 01:12:26.484
- How'd it go?
- It couldn't have gone better.

01:12:26.647 --> 01:12:30.162
He has to finish this picture first.
Mine will be next.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:36.125
Get Gordon Cole.
Tell him to forget about her car.

01:12:36.287 --> 01:12:39.006
Say he can get
another old car someplace.

01:12:39.167 --> 01:12:42.443
I'll buy him five old cars if necessary.

01:12:48.887 --> 01:12:51.355
<i>After that, an army of beauty experts</i>

01:12:51.527 --> 01:12:54.644
<i>invaded her house</i>
<i>on Sunset Boulevard.</i>

01:12:54.807 --> 01:12:57.765
<i>She went through</i>
<i>a merciless series of treatments.</i>

01:12:57.927 --> 01:13:01.681
<i>Like an athlete training for the Olympics,</i>
<i>she counted every calorie,</i>

01:13:01.847 --> 01:13:04.077
<i>went to bed every night at nine.</i>

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:07.444
<i>She was absolutely</i>
<i>determined to be ready,</i>

01:13:07.607 --> 01:13:10.644
<i>ready for those cameras</i>
<i>that would never turn.</i>

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:48.076
- Darling, are you there?
- Yes.

01:13:48.247 --> 01:13:52.638
Don't turn around.
Keep your eyes on the book.

01:13:53.527 --> 01:13:57.202
I just came to say goodnight.
You mustn't see me.

01:13:57.367 --> 01:14:00.245
- I'm not very attractive.
- Goodnight.

01:14:00.407 --> 01:14:03.160
- I've lost half a pound.
- Good.

01:14:03.327 --> 01:14:07.036
I was worried about my throat.
This woman's done wonders.

01:14:07.207 --> 01:14:11.803
- Good.
- You'd better get to bed yourself.

01:14:11.967 --> 01:14:17.803
- I think I'll read a little longer.
- You went out last night, didn't you?

01:14:17.967 --> 01:14:20.401
- Why do you say that?
- I know.

01:14:20.567 --> 01:14:24.799
I had a nightmare and screamed
for you. Where were you?

01:14:24.967 --> 01:14:29.438
- I went for a walk.
- No, you didn't. You took the car.

01:14:29.607 --> 01:14:34.635
I drove to the beach. You don't
want me to feel I'm locked up here?

01:14:34.807 --> 01:14:38.641
Of course not.
I just don't want to be left alone.

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:42.800
Not while I'm under this strain.
My nerves are torn to shreds.

01:14:42.967 --> 01:14:47.643
All I ask is for you to be
a little patient and a little kind.

01:14:48.927 --> 01:14:53.205
- I haven't done anything.
- Of course you haven't.

01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:57.042
I wouldn't let you. Goodnight, darling.

01:15:24.967 --> 01:15:29.677
<i>Yes, I was playing hookey</i>
<i>every evening along in there.</i>

01:15:29.847 --> 01:15:35.604
<i>It reminded me of being twelve,</i>
<i>sneaking out to see a gangster film.</i>

01:15:35.767 --> 01:15:40.716
<i>This time, it wasn; t to see a picture,</i>
<i>it was to try and write one.</i>

01:15:40.887 --> 01:15:42.798
<i>That story Betty Schaefer dug up</i>

01:15:42.967 --> 01:15:46.960
<i>kept going through my head</i>
<i>like a dozen locomotives.</i>

01:15:47.127 --> 01:15:52.520
<i>So we started working on it,</i>
<i>nights when the studio was deserted,</i>

01:15:52.687 --> 01:15:55.759
<i>up in her little cubby-hole of an office.</i>

01:16:10.727 --> 01:16:13.002
I got the funniest letter from Artie.

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:15.886
It's rained every day
since they got there.

01:16:16.047 --> 01:16:19.722
They rewrote the whole picture
for rain and shot half.

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:23.359
Now the sun's out,
nobody knows when they'll get back.

01:16:23.527 --> 01:16:27.440
- Good.
- Why good? I miss him terribly.

01:16:27.607 --> 01:16:30.804
- I mean this good dialogue will play.
- It will?

01:16:30.967 --> 01:16:35.119
Sure, especially with lots of music
drowning it out.

01:16:35.287 --> 01:16:39.439
- Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
- Constantly.

01:16:39.607 --> 01:16:42.405
In all seriousness, this is really good.

01:16:42.567 --> 01:16:46.321
- It's fun writing with you.
- Oh, thanks.

01:16:59.647 --> 01:17:03.845
- Who's Norma?
- Who's who?

01:17:04.007 --> 01:17:07.238
I'm sorry, I don't usually read
private cigarette cases.

01:17:07.407 --> 01:17:11.764
Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine.

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:15.283
A middle-aged lady,
very foolish and very generous.

01:17:15.447 --> 01:17:17.517
I'll say, this is solid gold.

01:17:17.687 --> 01:17:20.281
I gave her advice on an idiotic script.

01:17:20.447 --> 01:17:24.645
The old familiar story. You help
a timid soul across a crowded street.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:29.039
She turns out to be a multi-millionaire
and leaves you all her money.

01:17:29.207 --> 01:17:32.438
That's the trouble with you readers.
You know all the plots.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:36.316
Now suppose you proofread
page ten while the water boils, OK?

01:17:36.487 --> 01:17:38.842
OK.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:03.319
<i>Sometimes when we got stuck,</i>

01:18:03.487 --> 01:18:06.320
<i>we; d make a little tour</i>
<i>of the drowsing lot.</i>

01:18:06.487 --> 01:18:11.845
<i>Not talking much, just wandering</i>
<i>down alleys between the stages,</i>

01:18:12.007 --> 01:18:16.046
<i>or through the sets they were getting</i>
<i>ready for the next day; s shooting.</i>

01:18:16.207 --> 01:18:21.361
<i>In fact, it was on one of those walks</i>
<i>when she told me about her nose.</i>

01:18:21.527 --> 01:18:23.279
Look at this street.

01:18:23.447 --> 01:18:27.759
All cardboard, all hollow,
all phoney, all done with mirrors.

01:18:27.927 --> 01:18:31.761
I like it better
than any street in the world.

01:18:31.927 --> 01:18:35.761
Maybe because
I used to play here when I was a kid.

01:18:35.927 --> 01:18:37.963
Were you a child actress?

01:18:38.127 --> 01:18:42.803
No, I was born two blocks from
the studio, Lemon Grove Avenue.

01:18:42.967 --> 01:18:46.516
My father was head electrician here.
Mother still works in wardrobe.

01:18:46.687 --> 01:18:48.917
- Second generation, huh?
- Third.

01:18:49.087 --> 01:18:52.682
Grandma did stunt work for Pearl
White. I'm from a picture family.

01:18:52.847 --> 01:18:54.997
They expected me to become a star.

01:18:55.167 --> 01:18:59.285
So I had ten years of dramatic
lessons, diction, dancing.

01:18:59.447 --> 01:19:03.235
Then the studio made a test.
They didn't like my nose.

01:19:03.407 --> 01:19:06.797
Slanted this way a little.
So I had it fixed.

01:19:06.967 --> 01:19:10.926
Then they loved my nose,
only they didn't like my acting.

01:19:14.847 --> 01:19:18.806
- Nice job.
- It should be, it cost $300.

01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:21.197
- That's sad.
- Not at all.

01:19:21.367 --> 01:19:25.519
It taught me sense. I worked up
from the mail room to being reader.

01:19:25.687 --> 01:19:29.965
Come clean. At night you weep
for the lost close-ups, those galas.

01:19:30.127 --> 01:19:33.836
Not once. What's wrong with being
the other side of the cameras?

01:19:34.007 --> 01:19:37.841
- It's really more fun.
- Three cheers for Betty Schaefer.

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:43.923
- I will now kiss that nose of yours.
- If you please.

01:19:45.687 --> 01:19:48.406
May I say that you smell real special?

01:19:48.567 --> 01:19:53.846
- Must be my new shampoo.
- That's no shampoo.

01:19:54.007 --> 01:19:57.204
It's more like freshly laundered
linen handkerchiefs,

01:19:57.367 --> 01:20:00.325
like a brand-new automobile.

01:20:00.487 --> 01:20:04.002
- How old are you?
- 22.

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:09.195
Smart girl. Nothing like being 22.

01:20:09.367 --> 01:20:15.203
May I suggest, if we're ever to finish
this story, stay at least two feet away.

01:20:15.367 --> 01:20:18.325
The first time
you see me coming any closer,

01:20:18.487 --> 01:20:21.638
clunk me on the head with a shoe.

01:20:21.807 --> 01:20:27.279
Now, back to the typewriters,
by way of Washington Square.

01:21:10.207 --> 01:21:14.758
What is it, Max?
Want to wash the car?

01:21:14.927 --> 01:21:17.805
Or are you spying in your off hours?

01:21:17.967 --> 01:21:22.643
Be careful as you cross the patio.
Madame may be watching.

01:21:22.807 --> 01:21:26.766
How about going up the kitchen stairs
and undressing in the dark?

01:21:26.927 --> 01:21:29.680
I'm not enquiring
where Mr Gillis goes every night.

01:21:29.847 --> 01:21:35.444
Why don't you? I'm writing a script
and I'm going to finish it!

01:21:35.607 --> 01:21:39.759
It's just that I am greatly
worried about Madame.

01:21:39.927 --> 01:21:43.442
Sure you are.
And we're not helping her any.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:48.123
Feeding her lies and more lies,
getting herself ready for a picture.

01:21:48.287 --> 01:21:52.803
- What happens when she finds out?
- She never will.

01:21:52.967 --> 01:21:57.199
That is my job
and it has been for a long time.

01:21:57.367 --> 01:22:03.237
Understand, I discovered her when
she was sixteen. I made her a star.

01:22:03.407 --> 01:22:07.161
I cannot let her be destroyed.

01:22:07.327 --> 01:22:13.277
- You made her a star?
- Yes, I directed all her early films.

01:22:13.447 --> 01:22:17.201
There were three young directors
who showed promise in those days.

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:22.646
D W Griffith, Cecil B DeMille
and Max Von Mayerling.

01:22:24.527 --> 01:22:26.677
And she's turned you into a servant.

01:22:26.847 --> 01:22:31.079
It was I who asked to come back,
humiliating as it may seem.

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:33.841
I could've continued my career,

01:22:34.007 --> 01:22:38.956
only I found everything
unendurable after she'd left me.

01:22:39.127 --> 01:22:43.882
You see, I was her first husband.

01:23:09.847 --> 01:23:12.407
You're here, Joe.

01:23:13.127 --> 01:23:15.243
When did you come home?

01:23:19.367 --> 01:23:24.282
Oh, Joe, where were you?
Is it a woman?

01:23:24.447 --> 01:23:28.884
I know it's a woman. Who is she?
Why can't I ask you?

01:23:29.047 --> 01:23:32.039
I must know.

01:24:22.887 --> 01:24:25.196
What's the matter?

01:24:27.327 --> 01:24:32.242
Betty, wake up.
Why are you staring at me like that?

01:24:32.407 --> 01:24:35.319
Oh, was I? I'm sorry.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:37.955
What's wrong with you tonight?

01:24:38.127 --> 01:24:40.721
- What is it?
- Something came up.

01:24:40.887 --> 01:24:44.721
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?

01:24:50.807 --> 01:24:53.321
I just don't.

01:25:00.407 --> 01:25:05.197
What have you heard?
Come on, let's have it.

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:08.837
Is it about me?

01:25:19.687 --> 01:25:24.681
Betty, there's no use running out on it.
Let's face it, whatever it is.

01:25:24.847 --> 01:25:31.036
- I got a telegram from Artie.
- From Artie? What's wrong?

01:25:31.207 --> 01:25:33.960
He wants me to come on to Arizona.

01:25:34.127 --> 01:25:38.723
He says it only costs two dollars
to get married there.

01:25:38.887 --> 01:25:41.606
It would save us a honeymoon.

01:25:41.767 --> 01:25:47.125
Why don't you? We can finish
the script by Thursday.

01:25:47.287 --> 01:25:50.643
Stop crying. You're getting married.
That's what you wanted.

01:25:50.807 --> 01:25:53.765
I don't want it now.

01:25:53.927 --> 01:26:00.400
- Why not, don't you love Artie?
- Course I love him. I always will.

01:26:00.567 --> 01:26:05.402
I'm not in love with him
any more, that's all.

01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:07.637
What happened?

01:26:08.527 --> 01:26:11.041
You did.

01:26:22.807 --> 01:26:25.799
<i>It wasn; t until I got back</i>
<i>to my peculiar prison</i>

01:26:25.967 --> 01:26:29.118
<i>that I started facing the facts.</i>

01:26:30.287 --> 01:26:35.645
<i>There it was. Betty Schaefer; s future</i>
<i>right in the palm of my hand.</i>

01:26:35.807 --> 01:26:40.801
<i>Betty Schaefer engaged to Artie</i>
<i>Green, as nice a guy as ever lived,</i>

01:26:40.967 --> 01:26:45.040
<i>and she was in love with me - me.</i>

01:26:56.567 --> 01:27:00.719
<i>She was a fool not to sense there</i>
<i>was something phoney in my set-up.</i>

01:27:00.887 --> 01:27:03.959
<i>I was a heel not to have told her.</i>

01:27:04.127 --> 01:27:08.917
<i>But you just can; t say those things</i>
<i>to somebody you; re crazy about.</i>

01:27:09.087 --> 01:27:14.002
<i>Maybe I could get away with it,</i>
<i>get away from Norma.</i>

01:27:14.167 --> 01:27:18.797
<i>Maybe I could wipe</i>
<i>the whole nasty mess out of my life.</i>

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:29.517
Hello, is this Gladstone 9281?

01:27:29.687 --> 01:27:33.839
May I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer?
She must be home by now.

01:27:34.407 --> 01:27:39.561
Hey, Betty, here's that
weird-sounding woman again.

01:27:39.727 --> 01:27:44.755
Well, what is this anyway?
This is Betty Schaefer.

01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:49.205
Forgive me for calling so late,
but I feel it's my duty.

01:27:49.367 --> 01:27:53.997
It's about Mr Gillis.
You do know Mr Gillis?

01:27:54.167 --> 01:27:58.001
Exactly how much
do you know about him?

01:27:58.167 --> 01:28:04.720
Do you know where he lives,
how he lives, what he lives on?

01:28:05.247 --> 01:28:09.206
Who are you? What do you want?
What business is it of yours?

01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:13.406
Miss Schaefer,
I'm trying to do you a favour

01:28:13.567 --> 01:28:17.003
and spare you a great deal of misery.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:21.763
You may be too young to even
suspect there are men of his sort.

01:28:21.927 --> 01:28:25.715
I don't know what he's said,
but he does not live with relatives,

01:28:25.887 --> 01:28:30.039
nor with friends
in the usual sense of the word.

01:28:30.207 --> 01:28:33.324
Ask him. Ask him again.

01:28:38.007 --> 01:28:41.158
That's right, Betty,
ask me again. This is Joe.

01:28:41.687 --> 01:28:45.805
Joe, where are you?
What is this all about?

01:28:47.607 --> 01:28:51.077
Better yet,
come out and see for yourself.

01:28:51.247 --> 01:28:56.480
The address is
10086 Sunset Boulevard.

01:29:09.847 --> 01:29:13.556
Don't hate me, Joe.
I did it because I need you.

01:29:13.727 --> 01:29:17.959
I need you as I've never needed
you before. Look at me.

01:29:18.127 --> 01:29:22.439
Look at my hands,
my face, under my eyes.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:25.519
How can I work if I'm wasting away
under this torment?

01:29:25.687 --> 01:29:30.477
You don't know what I've been
through these last weeks.

01:29:35.967 --> 01:29:40.882
I bought a revolver. I stood in front
of that mirror, but I couldn't do it.

01:29:41.047 --> 01:29:43.436
Don't just stand there hating me.

01:29:43.607 --> 01:29:48.123
Shout at me, strike me,
but don't hate me.

01:29:48.287 --> 01:29:51.120
Say you don't hate me, Joe.

01:30:04.727 --> 01:30:08.800
Here's 10079, Connie.
It must be over there.

01:30:17.967 --> 01:30:22.995
- Betty, let me come with you.
- No, I'll be all right.

01:30:29.087 --> 01:30:33.763
I love you, Joe.
I love you, Joe.

01:30:33.927 --> 01:30:36.122
I love you.

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:43.155
What are you going to do, Joe?
What are you going to do?

01:30:50.447 --> 01:30:54.156
It's all right, Max. I'll take it.
Hello, Betty.

01:30:54.327 --> 01:30:57.046
I'm so scared.
Is there something awful?

01:30:57.207 --> 01:30:59.596
Come on in.

01:31:04.887 --> 01:31:07.959
Ever been in one of these
old Hollywood palazzos?

01:31:08.127 --> 01:31:11.642
That's from when they were making
$18,000 a week tax-free.

01:31:11.807 --> 01:31:16.085
Careful of these tiles, they're slippery.
Valentino used to dance here.

01:31:16.247 --> 01:31:19.796
- Is this where you live?
- You bet.

01:31:19.967 --> 01:31:23.004
- Whose house is it?
- Hers.

01:31:23.167 --> 01:31:26.239
- Whose?
- Look around, there's a lot of her.

01:31:26.407 --> 01:31:31.800
If you don't remember the face, you've
heard the name. Norma Desmond?

01:31:31.967 --> 01:31:34.322
- That was her on the phone?
- Drink?

01:31:34.487 --> 01:31:37.285
There's always champagne,
plenty of caviar.

01:31:37.447 --> 01:31:41.281
- Why did she call me?
- Jealous.

01:31:41.447 --> 01:31:45.565
Ever see so much junk? She had
the ceiling brought from Portugal.

01:31:45.727 --> 01:31:47.843
And look at this.

01:31:50.007 --> 01:31:51.725
Her own movie theatre.

01:31:51.887 --> 01:31:57.200
I didn't come to see a house.
What about Norma Desmond?

01:31:57.367 --> 01:32:01.997
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is an enormous place.

01:32:02.167 --> 01:32:06.683
Eight master bedrooms.
A sunken tub in every bathroom.

01:32:06.847 --> 01:32:10.203
There's a bowling alley in the cellar.

01:32:11.727 --> 01:32:16.005
It's lonely here,
so she got herself a companion.

01:32:16.167 --> 01:32:18.158
Very simple set-up.

01:32:18.327 --> 01:32:21.603
Older woman who's well-to-do.

01:32:21.767 --> 01:32:25.396
A younger man
who's not doing too well.

01:32:25.567 --> 01:32:28.400
- Can you figure it out?
- No.

01:32:28.567 --> 01:32:34.119
- I'll give you a few more clues.
- No, I haven't heard any of this.

01:32:34.287 --> 01:32:38.246
I never got those telephone calls
and I've never been in this house.

01:32:38.407 --> 01:32:40.398
Get your things and let's go.

01:32:42.487 --> 01:32:44.125
All my things?

01:32:44.287 --> 01:32:48.041
My 18 suits, my custom-made
shoes, the six dozen shirts,

01:32:48.207 --> 01:32:52.723
the cufflinks, the platinum key-chains
and the cigarette cases?

01:32:52.887 --> 01:32:56.516
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on where?

01:32:56.687 --> 01:32:59.440
To a one-room apartment
I can't pay for,

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:02.679
to a story that may sell
and very possibly won't?

01:33:02.847 --> 01:33:07.204
- If you love me, Joe.
- Look, sweetie, be practical.

01:33:07.367 --> 01:33:11.406
I've got a good deal here.
A long-term contract with no options.

01:33:11.567 --> 01:33:15.845
I like it that way.
Maybe it's not very admirable.

01:33:18.487 --> 01:33:22.685
Well, you and Artie can be admirable.

01:33:24.647 --> 01:33:28.720
I can't look at you any more, Joe.

01:33:31.007 --> 01:33:36.161
How about looking for the exit?
This way, Betty.

01:33:50.167 --> 01:33:56.436
Good luck, Betty. You can finish
that script on the way to Arizona.

01:33:56.607 --> 01:34:00.520
When you and Artie get back,
if you ever want a swim...

01:34:02.087 --> 01:34:04.647
...here's the pool.

01:34:46.527 --> 01:34:49.519
Thank you, darling. Thank you, Joe.

01:34:51.207 --> 01:34:53.163
Joe.

01:35:16.767 --> 01:35:20.237
May I come in, Joe?
I've stopped crying.

01:35:20.407 --> 01:35:24.002
I'm all right again.
Tell me you're not cross.

01:35:24.167 --> 01:35:27.876
Tell me everything
is just as it was, Joe.

01:35:30.047 --> 01:35:31.958
Joe.

01:35:34.607 --> 01:35:37.201
What are you doing, Joe?

01:35:42.287 --> 01:35:45.324
- What are you doing?
- I'm packing.

01:35:48.007 --> 01:35:51.443
- You're leaving me?
- Yes, I am, Norma.

01:35:51.607 --> 01:35:54.326
No, you're not. Max! Max!

01:35:55.287 --> 01:36:01.203
Thanks for the handsome wardrobe
and for the use of all the trinkets.

01:36:03.047 --> 01:36:05.880
- The rest's in the drawer.
- It's yours.

01:36:06.047 --> 01:36:10.438
I'd take it, only it's too dressy
for a copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.

01:36:11.007 --> 01:36:16.286
These are nothing. You can have
anything. What do you want?

01:36:16.447 --> 01:36:18.165
Money?

01:36:18.327 --> 01:36:22.320
You'd be throwing it away.
I don't qualify for the job any more.

01:36:22.487 --> 01:36:27.242
You can't go. Max!
I can't face life without you.

01:36:29.767 --> 01:36:33.840
- You know I'm not afraid to die.
- That's between you and yourself.

01:36:34.007 --> 01:36:38.319
You think I made that up
about the gun, don't you? All right.

01:36:46.327 --> 01:36:50.559
See? You didn't believe me.
You don't think I have the courage?

01:36:50.727 --> 01:36:53.639
- Sure, if it makes a good scene.
- You don't care.

01:36:53.807 --> 01:36:55.843
Hundreds of thousands will!

01:36:56.007 --> 01:36:59.920
You'd be killing yourself to an empty
house. The audience left years ago.

01:37:00.087 --> 01:37:03.602
- That's a lie. They still want me.
- No, they don't.

01:37:03.767 --> 01:37:06.884
- What about DeMille?
- He was sparing your feelings.

01:37:07.047 --> 01:37:10.039
- The studio only wanted your car.
- What?

01:37:10.207 --> 01:37:13.677
DeMille didn't have
the heart to say. None of us has.

01:37:13.847 --> 01:37:19.160
That's a lie. They want me.
I get letters every day.

01:37:19.327 --> 01:37:24.082
You tell her, Max. Do her that favour.
Tell her there'll be no picture.

01:37:24.247 --> 01:37:26.920
The only fan letters
are the ones you write.

01:37:27.087 --> 01:37:30.318
That isn't true. Max!

01:37:30.487 --> 01:37:34.036
Madame is the greatest star
of them all.

01:37:34.207 --> 01:37:38.519
I will take Mr Gillis's bags to the car.

01:37:43.167 --> 01:37:47.285
You heard him. I'm a star.

01:37:47.447 --> 01:37:50.120
You're a woman of 50. Grow up.

01:37:50.287 --> 01:37:54.599
There's nothing tragic about being 50,
unless you try to be 25.

01:37:54.767 --> 01:37:58.123
The greatest star of them all.

01:38:03.287 --> 01:38:05.596
Goodbye, Norma.

01:38:06.967 --> 01:38:12.519
No one ever leaves a star.
That's what makes one a star.

01:38:18.327 --> 01:38:21.558
Joe! Joe!

01:38:22.927 --> 01:38:24.883
Joe!

01:38:30.127 --> 01:38:32.357
Joe!

01:39:03.687 --> 01:39:08.078
The stars are ageless, aren't they?

01:39:14.487 --> 01:39:17.957
<i>Well, this is where you came in.</i>

01:39:18.127 --> 01:39:22.723
<i>Back at that pool again.</i>
<i>The one I always wanted.</i>

01:39:22.887 --> 01:39:26.960
<i>It; s dawn now and they must; ve</i>
<i>photographed me a thousand times.</i>

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:30.836
<i>Then they got a couple</i>
<i>of pruning hooks and fished me out</i>

01:39:31.007 --> 01:39:33.237
<i>ever so gently.</i>

01:39:33.407 --> 01:39:37.525
<i>Funny how gentle people</i>
<i>get with you once you; re dead.</i>

01:39:38.247 --> 01:39:41.319
<i>They beached me</i>
<i>like a harpooned baby whale.</i>

01:39:41.487 --> 01:39:47.164
<i>And started to check</i>
<i>the damage, just for the record.</i>

01:39:47.727 --> 01:39:52.881
<i>The whole joint was jumping, cops,</i>
<i>reporters, neighbours, passers-by.</i>

01:39:53.047 --> 01:39:56.722
<i>As much whoop-de-do as we get</i>
<i>when they open a supermarket.</i>

01:39:56.887 --> 01:39:59.447
<i>Even the newsreel guys</i>
<i>came roaring in.</i>

01:39:59.607 --> 01:40:03.725
<i>Here was an item</i>
<i>everybody could have some fun with.</i>

01:40:03.887 --> 01:40:09.200
<i>The heartless so-and-sos.</i>
<i>What would they do to Norma?</i>

01:40:09.367 --> 01:40:14.646
<i>Even if she got away with it in court,</i>
<i>crime of passion, temporary insanity,</i>

01:40:14.807 --> 01:40:17.401
<i>those headlines would kill her.</i>

01:40:17.567 --> 01:40:20.365
<i>; ; Forgotten star a slayer. ; ;</i>

01:40:20.527 --> 01:40:24.884
<i>; ; Ageing actress. ; ;
<i>; ; Yesterday; s glamour queen. ; ;</i></i>

01:40:34.887 --> 01:40:38.800
Coroner's office.
I want to speak to the coroner.

01:40:40.127 --> 01:40:43.278
- Who's on this phone?
- I am. Get off!

01:40:43.447 --> 01:40:45.039
This is more important.

01:40:45.207 --> 01:40:47.198
"Times" city desk?
Hedda Hopper speaking.

01:40:47.367 --> 01:40:49.517
I'm talking from
Norma Desmond's bedroom.

01:40:49.687 --> 01:40:53.316
Don't bother with a rewrite.
Take it direct. Ready?

01:40:53.487 --> 01:40:56.001
As day breaks over
the murder house, Norma Desmond,

01:40:56.167 --> 01:41:00.922
famous star of yesteryear, is
in a state of complete mental shock.

01:41:01.087 --> 01:41:03.123
A curtain of silence surrounds her

01:41:03.287 --> 01:41:06.165
in the boudoir of her house
on Sunset Boulevard...

01:41:06.327 --> 01:41:10.036
Was it a sudden quarrel?
Had you had any trouble before?

01:41:11.127 --> 01:41:14.039
How come this gun was right there?

01:41:14.207 --> 01:41:18.837
This guy, where did you meet him?
Where did he come from?

01:41:19.007 --> 01:41:23.125
Had you thought of doing
something like this before?

01:41:23.287 --> 01:41:27.838
Was theft involved? Did you catch
him trying to steal something?

01:41:28.007 --> 01:41:30.840
- The newsreel cameras are here.
- Tell them to go.

01:41:31.007 --> 01:41:33.601
This is no time for cameras.

01:41:33.767 --> 01:41:38.557
Now, Miss Desmond,
is there anything you want to tell us?

01:41:38.727 --> 01:41:43.801
Cameras? What is it, Max?

01:41:48.567 --> 01:41:52.082
- The cameras have arrived.
- They have?

01:41:52.247 --> 01:41:56.525
- Tell Mr DeMille I'll be right on set.
- What is this?

01:42:01.207 --> 01:42:05.041
It's one way to get her downstairs.

01:42:05.207 --> 01:42:10.042
Let's have the car right outside. OK.

01:42:11.367 --> 01:42:15.519
- Everything will be ready, Madame.
- Thank you, Max.

01:42:15.687 --> 01:42:21.045
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but I must get ready for my scene.

01:42:21.207 --> 01:42:23.357
- What's happening?
- Any statement?

01:42:23.527 --> 01:42:25.882
Is there a confession?

01:42:26.047 --> 01:42:28.686
- Everything set up?
- Just about.

01:42:28.847 --> 01:42:31.441
- Lights ready?
- All set.

01:42:42.927 --> 01:42:45.725
OK, fellas, hold it, hold it!

01:42:48.407 --> 01:42:50.796
Quiet, everybody!

01:42:53.087 --> 01:42:54.679
Lights.

01:42:58.807 --> 01:43:00.365
Ready, Norma?

01:43:02.647 --> 01:43:06.959
What is the scene? Where am I?

01:43:09.447 --> 01:43:11.438
This is the palace staircase.

01:43:14.167 --> 01:43:17.239
Oh, yes, yes.

01:43:17.407 --> 01:43:21.525
Down below
they're waiting for the princess.

01:43:23.247 --> 01:43:24.680
I'm ready.

01:43:25.487 --> 01:43:30.003
All right. Cameras. Action!

01:43:32.567 --> 01:43:37.687
<i>So they were turning after all,</i>
<i>those cameras.</i>

01:43:37.847 --> 01:43:44.116
<i>Life, which can be strangely merciful,</i>
<i>had taken pity on Norma Desmond.</i>

01:43:44.287 --> 01:43:49.884
<i>The dream she had clung to</i>
<i>so desperately had enfolded her.</i>

01:44:16.727 --> 01:44:20.925
I can't go on with this scene,
I'm too happy.

01:44:21.087 --> 01:44:25.683
Mr DeMille, do you mind
if I say a few words? Thank you.

01:44:25.847 --> 01:44:30.796
I want to say how happy I am to be
in the studio making a picture again.

01:44:30.967 --> 01:44:36.678
You don't know how I've missed you.
I'll never desert you again.

01:44:36.847 --> 01:44:41.204
Because after "Salome" we'll make
another picture and another.

01:44:41.367 --> 01:44:46.885
You see, this is my life.
It always will be. There's nothing else.

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:50.881
Just us and the cameras

01:44:51.047 --> 01:44:55.598
and those wonderful people
out there in the dark.

01:44:56.887 --> 01:44:59.242
All right, Mr DeMille,
I'm ready for my close-up.
