时间轴：~dispirited 后期：渔夫

00:10.900 --> 00:12.440
Previously on 24

00:12.440 --> 00:15.070
We need to pick him off to
try to save the president.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.710
I'll make a run for the lockdown room.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.880
There are five canisters of ch-4.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.880
All we need is one stray bullet.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.890
A suicide play, Jack.

00:22.950 --> 00:24.468
We don't have a choice.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.230
Don't you move!

00:32.659 --> 00:33.820
We have the president!

00:33.860 --> 00:35.090
The president is secure!

00:35.130 --> 00:36.430
I'm so sorry, Jack.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.060
I know that he was your friend.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.460
It was supposed to be me.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.570
Juma and his men were not working alone.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.330
And right now, the only lead
we've got is Ryan Burnett.

00:43.370 --> 00:45.140
He knew about the attack
on the White House,

00:45.180 --> 00:48.140
And chances are, he's gonna
know who Juma was talking to.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.550
I'm thinking about

00:49.610 --> 00:51.150
Bringing Olivia on

00:51.220 --> 00:54.250
As a special advisor.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.050
Nobody's forgotten what she
did during the campaign.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.950
Leaking damaging personal information

00:57.990 --> 00:59.520
About your opponent to the press.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.990
She's changed.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.790
It's not the past that concerns me.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.019
Do you think any of this

01:04.060 --> 01:06.090
Would've happened if my
mother had a chief advisor

01:06.130 --> 01:08.360
Who knew what the hell was going
on in her administration?

01:08.400 --> 01:10.490
I just got off the phone
with Ethan Kanin.

01:10.530 --> 01:13.530
He's ordering me to let
Bauer interrogate Burnett.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.400
Look, I didn't want to go
behind your back,

01:15.440 --> 01:16.870
But you didn't leave me any choice.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.370
I want you to clean out your office

01:18.410 --> 01:19.770
And hand in your badge.

01:19.810 --> 01:21.064
I'm suspending you.

01:21.110 --> 01:24.310
Jack Bauer's on his way to
Kennedy memorial hospital.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.280
Burnett will tell him everything.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.910
I have already sent somebody
to the hospital

01:27.950 --> 01:29.336
To deal with Burnett.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.680
He can take care of Bauer
at the same time.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.320
You lay one finger on him, it's over.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.960
Right.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.790
Juma's attack failed.

01:37.860 --> 01:39.576
He's dead, so are his men.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.390
Somebody get me the hell out of here!

01:42.430 --> 01:43.830
You're not going anywhere.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.930
What happened?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.056
What's going on?

01:55.380 --> 01:57.360
Damn it, Bauer, open the door!

01:58.920 --> 02:02.320
I want a high-priority APB
issued for Jack Bauer.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.580
Larry, it's Jack. Listen to me.

02:03.620 --> 02:04.890
I'm being set up.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.420
Don't let them get away with this.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.130
This threat is not over.

02:08.130 --> 02:13.130
The following takes place
between 9 p.m and 10 p.m.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.550
I dropped my wife
off here five hours ago,

03:13.590 --> 03:15.790
And now no one can tell me where she is.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.420
Mr O'Brian, the White House
has been attacked.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.060
We're in the midst
of an urgent protocol.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.610
Exactly. That's why I'd like to

03:20.650 --> 03:22.130
know if my wife all right.

03:22.170 --> 03:23.360
She is; she's fine.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.370
Where is she?

03:25.440 --> 03:26.570
Tell me.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.600
She's in a holding room
on the third floor.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.300
What…? She's been arrested.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.140
That's absurd.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.170
What's she charged with?
I want to see her.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.870
Listen, I've already told you
more than I should have.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.080
When agent Moss returns, he'll tell you

03:37.120 --> 03:38.140
Everything you need to know.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.410
In the meanwhile, I'm gonna have

03:39.450 --> 03:41.250
To ask you to wait in
the conference room, okay?

03:41.290 --> 03:42.380
Please. I'm sorry.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.850
Please escort him
to the conference room.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.990
Thank you.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.150
Janis, Larry's calling for you.

03:48.190 --> 03:49.320
He says it's urgent.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.490
What line? Three.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.130
Sign here, verifying you understand

03:53.200 --> 03:54.960
The terms of your suspension,

03:55.000 --> 03:56.330
And again here…

03:56.400 --> 03:58.000
Agent walker?

03:58.070 --> 03:59.200
Go ahead, I'm listening.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.240
Larry, it's Janis.

04:01.310 --> 04:03.010
Ryan Burnett is dead.

04:03.070 --> 04:04.670
How?

04:04.740 --> 04:06.340
Bauer was interrogating him
when it happened,

04:06.380 --> 04:07.832
And we're responsible.

04:07.850 --> 04:09.770
You're saying that Bauer killed Burnett?

04:09.810 --> 04:10.950
I don't know.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.110
He escaped before I could get to him.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.700
He called me, said he was being

04:14.740 --> 04:16.786
set up and he wouldn't come in.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.420
I lost him, Janis.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.620
I lost him, and it's on me to find him.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.950
Just tell me what you need.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.490
I already sent out a priority,
all-agency APB.  

04:26.530 --> 04:28.160
I need you to follow up on that.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.530
I'm coming back to the office right now.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.130
I'll coordinate the search operation
from there.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.140
Okay.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.040
Open an all-agency channel

04:37.110 --> 04:38.870
With flags for immediate action
on Jack Bauer.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.370
I'll make sure the local
police departments

04:40.410 --> 04:41.340
Are linked in.

04:41.410 --> 04:42.370
On it. Thank you.

04:42.410 --> 04:43.740
Janis, what did Larry say?

04:43.780 --> 04:45.210
Jack get anything out of Burnett?

04:45.250 --> 04:46.280
You're suspended.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.580
I cannot discuss this with you.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.980
Janis, this was my case.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.980
Tell me if Jack got anything
out of Burnett.

04:51.020 --> 04:53.220
Burnett is dead.

04:53.290 --> 04:55.138
Well, tell me what happened.

04:55.190 --> 04:58.030
Bauer was there, and now he's missing.

04:59.230 --> 05:00.590
Janis, the channel's open.

05:00.630 --> 05:01.630
Thank you.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.160
That's all I know, honestly.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.972
So, please, let me get
back to work, okay?

05:09.010 --> 05:12.046
Please attach Jack Bauer's
profile to the APB.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.930
Got you.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.610
Walker.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.640
Renée, it's Jack.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.070
Don't hang up the phone, please.

05:49.110 --> 05:51.280
Whatever they told you,
I did not kill Burnett.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.380
Renée?

05:53.450 --> 05:54.550
Yeah.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.690
Bill was right.

05:55.750 --> 05:56.980
There are still very powerful people

05:57.020 --> 05:58.680
Involved in this conspiracy
that were not named

05:58.720 --> 06:00.160
In Dubaku's drive.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.520
They're trying to cover their tracks.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.490
They killed Burnett, and
they're framing me for it.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.160
Even if I wanted to help you, Jack,

06:05.200 --> 06:07.020
Larry has every law enforcement
agency within 100 miles

06:07.060 --> 06:08.660
Looking for you, and
I have been suspended.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.930
All I want you to do is make an ID.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.530
I got a frame grab from the
hospital's surveillance.

06:12.570 --> 06:13.560
I sent you a photo

06:13.600 --> 06:14.970
Of the man who did kill Burnett.

06:15.010 --> 06:17.340
It's in your inbox.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.110
Renée, this man is

06:21.180 --> 06:22.810
The only connection
I have to whoever else

06:22.850 --> 06:24.140
Is involved in this thing.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.420
Please, I need your help.

06:27.490 --> 06:28.720
Look, I know you don't agree

06:28.760 --> 06:30.250
with some of thing I did to the

06:30.290 --> 06:34.260
But… I'm telling you the truth.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.760
Renée?

06:37.830 --> 06:40.760
You know what?

06:40.830 --> 06:41.960
Forget it. I'm-I'm sorry.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.030
I made a mistake.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.314
I'll call you back at this number.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.240
Metro police,

06:52.310 --> 06:53.640
This is the FBI reporting.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.110
We have a suspect, Jack Bauer,
that's escaped custody.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.526
All available units, please respond.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.020
Yes, Quinn.

07:08.090 --> 07:09.938
Bauer got away from the FBI.

07:09.990 --> 07:10.960
How?

07:11.030 --> 07:12.130
Well, Bauer is

07:12.200 --> 07:13.490
An extremely impressive operative.

07:13.530 --> 07:15.230
You don't have to tell me that.

07:15.270 --> 07:18.130
But the FBI has launched a
major effort to apprehend him.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.400
He won't be able to avoid them for long.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.570
Well, we'll see, won't we?

07:21.610 --> 07:24.030
Monitor the situation, keep me apprised.

07:24.070 --> 07:25.240
Yes, sir.

07:26.710 --> 07:29.510
If Bauer connects us to Juma,

07:29.580 --> 07:30.870
It could seriously impede
this operation.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.920
Yes, it could.

07:35.350 --> 07:36.810
Is the shipment on time?

07:36.850 --> 07:39.360
Yes. Due into port in the next hour.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.620
Then I don't foresee a problem.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.190
Once the weapons are deployed,

07:43.230 --> 07:47.124
Then it doesn't matter what Mr.
Bauer or anyone else knows.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.730
Something wrong?

07:49.800 --> 07:52.340
No, sir.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.340
Mr Seaton, I get no pleasure

07:56.410 --> 08:01.140
From the knowledge that
people will die at our hands.

08:01.210 --> 08:05.180
One single soul, the loss of
one soul is tragic to me,

08:05.250 --> 08:07.610
Let alone the numbers
we're talking about!

08:07.650 --> 08:09.650
But do not forget that every war

08:09.690 --> 08:11.880
Worth fighting involves
collateral damage.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.660
And what we're doing

08:13.720 --> 08:16.090
Is fundamentally and
absolutely necessary!

08:16.130 --> 08:18.090
And I know you understand that!

08:18.130 --> 08:19.530
Of course.

08:28.510 --> 08:30.370
Wake up our colleagues

08:30.440 --> 08:32.370
And have them assembled in one hour.

08:32.409 --> 08:35.340
And tell them to pack their
pajamas and their toothbrushes.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.650
It's gonna be a long night.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.790
Yeah?

08:50.860 --> 08:52.700
–I have an I. D
–Who is it?

08:52.760 --> 08:53.860
John Quinn.

08:53.930 --> 08:55.316
Black ops combat vet.

08:55.370 --> 08:57.090
Served tours all over the world.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.660
Now he works for Starkwood.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.030
The defense consultant?

09:00.070 --> 09:01.470
Uh, yeah, they started out
as consultants,

09:01.510 --> 09:03.370
But over the past few years,
while you were

09:03.410 --> 09:04.970
Out of the country,
the Pentagon outsourced

09:05.010 --> 09:07.000
Billions of dollars
in contracts to them.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.010
What kind of contracts?

09:08.050 --> 09:09.410
Manpower.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.070
Starkwood's basically a private army.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.780
They recruit ex-soldiers
and swat team members

09:12.820 --> 09:14.272
From around the world,

09:14.320 --> 09:16.450
Then they hire them back to
the military security teams.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.320
We're talking thousands of men
deployed here and abroad.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.650
Starkwood work with Juma?

09:20.690 --> 09:22.650
Well, if they did, it wasn't
on the books.

09:22.690 --> 09:25.690
But, you know, if anyone
knows, it's senator Mayer.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.100
Why Mayer?

09:28.170 --> 09:29.560
After he dismantled CTU,

09:29.600 --> 09:30.860
He launched several
other investigations.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.530
One of them has been
looking at Starkwood.

09:32.570 --> 09:34.060
What were they accused of?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.470
The hearings are classified, but

09:35.510 --> 09:38.440
Supposedly, Mayer has enough
to put them out of business.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.070
Okay, I'm gonna need to talk to him.

09:40.110 --> 09:41.710
See if you can access the CIRG logs.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.270
They should have a location on him.

09:43.310 --> 09:46.310
Okay. I'll send you Mayer's
location as soon as I have it.

09:46.350 --> 09:47.550
Thanks.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.050
Agent walker still here?

09:52.090 --> 09:53.350
She was just in her office.

09:53.390 --> 09:54.890
But there's somebody waiting to see you

09:54.930 --> 09:57.372
In the conference room. They need to…

10:21.650 --> 10:23.310
Just have a few more forms to fill out,

10:23.350 --> 10:24.350
Then I'm taking off.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.964
You hear what happened at the hospital?

10:28.230 --> 10:29.650
After everything that Jack's done today,

10:29.690 --> 10:32.360
Do you really believe
that he murdered Burnett?

10:32.400 --> 10:33.630
I don't know.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.360
I… I don't care.

10:35.430 --> 10:37.390
He's a federal fugitive
and needs to be found.

10:37.430 --> 10:40.940
But you think it's possible
that he did this?

10:41.010 --> 10:44.040
I'm not sure I do.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.140
It's been a long day.

10:48.210 --> 10:50.280
Go home, get some sleep.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.722
–I'll call you in the morning.
–Okay.

11:03.590 --> 11:05.130
Excuse me, Larry.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.760
Morris O'Brian is waiting
in the conference room.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.970
He wants to know why his wife
is in holding.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.940
Renée talked to Bauer.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.770
How do you know?

11:17.810 --> 11:20.270
Access her phone log
for the last 15 minutes

11:20.310 --> 11:21.290
And get into her workstation,

11:21.330 --> 11:22.440
find out what she's been doing

11:22.480 --> 11:24.080
All right.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.640
If we want to catch Bauer,
she's our best shot.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.690
Okay.

11:35.690 --> 11:38.650
We've received confirmation
that president Taylor

11:38.690 --> 11:40.560
will be making a statement
to the country shortly.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.930
She is expected to address the
attack on the white house

11:42.970 --> 11:44.690
That ended an hour ago
in a startling rescue.

11:44.730 --> 11:47.238
Now, based on the few details we have,

11:47.300 --> 11:49.760
We do know the rescue
resulted in the death

11:49.800 --> 11:52.308
Of general Juma and all of his forces.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.500
Angela, how much lead time
does the media need,

11:55.540 --> 11:57.740
Once I'm finished with my revisions?

11:57.780 --> 12:00.040
The major outlets will
put us on immediately.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.340
I'll be done shortly.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.680
Thank you, Angela.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.360
I have a thought

12:08.420 --> 12:10.050
About the speech, if
you'd like to hear it.

12:10.090 --> 12:11.190
Of course.

12:11.260 --> 12:13.860
Right now your main thrust
is reassurance.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.760
The attacks are behind us,

12:15.830 --> 12:17.530
Everything's going to be back to normal.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.560
But I think you're missing
an opportunity here.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.400
To do what?

12:21.470 --> 12:23.140
Claim victory.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.070
To say that Juma's death
means standing up

12:25.110 --> 12:27.140
To tyranny works, and that your decision

12:27.180 --> 12:29.570
To send troops into Sangala
was the right one.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.480
I'm not sure that this is

12:31.550 --> 12:33.580
The appropriate time
to sound triumphant, Livy.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.020
A lot of lives were lost today.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.150
And by addressing those deaths,
you give them meaning.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.990
Those people are heroes

12:41.060 --> 12:43.832
Who died in a war
that was worth fighting.

12:45.530 --> 12:46.730
Let's work it in.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.970
Come in.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.300
Madam president, I have
some troubling news.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.122
May I speak with you alone?

13:02.140 --> 13:04.714
You my speak freely in front of Olivia.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.380
Just after the attack
on the White House,

13:11.420 --> 13:12.810
Jack Bauer came forward

13:12.850 --> 13:14.434
With a disturbing claim.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.110
He said there were people

13:16.160 --> 13:18.990
Still at large who were
involved in the conspiracy—

13:19.030 --> 13:21.560
Persons unknown who had helped Juma

13:21.630 --> 13:23.430
Plan and execute the attacks.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.846
Did Bauer have any evidence of this?

13:25.870 --> 13:27.400
Nothing concrete.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.960
But he promoted the notion
that Ryan Burnett

13:30.000 --> 13:32.530
Was our best chance
of identifying these people,

13:32.570 --> 13:35.370
And Bauer asked to be allowed
to question him.

13:35.410 --> 13:39.450
This was supposed to be
a controlled situation.

13:39.510 --> 13:43.880
A ploy to intimidate Burnett
into giving up intel.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.620
So, I granted Bauer's request.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.046
It was a terrible mistake.

13:52.060 --> 13:54.330
What happened, Ethan?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.030
Burnett is dead.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.800
My God…

13:57.870 --> 13:59.370
The evidence suggests

13:59.430 --> 14:01.800
That he was killed by Bauer.

14:01.870 --> 14:03.600
I don't believe it!

14:03.670 --> 14:06.730
His claim of another party
being involved in the attacks

14:06.770 --> 14:08.740
Appear to have been a fabrication.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.110
A fabrication.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.710
It may have something to do
with Bill Buchanan's death;

14:12.750 --> 14:14.010
No one knows.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.380
But madam president,

14:16.450 --> 14:17.810
I take full responsibility.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.210
I was trying to insulate you.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.560
To provide you with deniability

14:21.620 --> 14:23.520
In case anything went wrong.

14:23.590 --> 14:27.352
Or was it because you thought
the president would say no?

14:27.460 --> 14:28.930
Olivia.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
Where is Bauer now?

14:32.470 --> 14:33.930
At large.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
The FBI is devoting its full
resources to the manhunt.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.910
Let me know the minute they find him.

14:39.970 --> 14:41.580
Yes, ma'am.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.180
Madam president…

14:47.720 --> 14:49.950
I'm sorry.

14:59.990 --> 15:01.930
Looks like everything.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.140
She's on the move.

15:23.120 --> 15:23.980
Where's Bauer?

15:24.020 --> 15:25.190
I don't know.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.250
Don't you lie to me.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.950
We traced two calls from your cell

15:27.990 --> 15:29.450
To a phone that was reported stolen.

15:29.490 --> 15:32.420
And we know you accessed a
classified government database

15:32.460 --> 15:35.090
And sent someone's name
and address to Bauer.

15:35.130 --> 15:38.290
Renée, that makes you an
accessory after the fact.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.470
Now tell me where he is.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.070
I can't.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.540
Damn it!

15:43.610 --> 15:45.470
I still don't believe that he did this.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.800
Then explain to me why he's
not turning himself in,

15:47.840 --> 15:50.070
And letting us help him find
this mysterious third party.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.640
Because he was framed
and he doesn't trust

15:51.680 --> 15:53.010
Our ability to work through it.

15:53.050 --> 15:54.580
And, you know, after what
we've put him through,

15:54.620 --> 15:56.072
How can you blame him?

15:56.690 --> 16:00.848
You're actually willing To sacrifice
everything to protect him.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.650
Once Jack finds the evidence,
he will call us.

16:05.690 --> 16:09.130
You know, Janis is decrypting
what you sent.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.160
It's not going to take her a long time.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.630
We are going to find him.

16:12.670 --> 16:15.330
Renée, tell me whose
information you sent.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.600
I'll let the A.G know that
you're cooperating.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.540
I'm sorry, Larry.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.310
Put her in holding.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.910
Mirandize her.

16:47.270 --> 16:48.326
Good night, sir.

16:48.370 --> 16:50.700
See you in the morning.

17:39.090 --> 17:42.090
Hello?

17:48.460 --> 17:50.260
Keep your hands where
I can see them, senator.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.030
Bauer.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.030
Take a seat.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.400
I know what you did to Ryan Burnett.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.140
I'm not going to let you
butcher me like you did him.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.380
You want me dead, Bauer,

18:06.450 --> 18:08.040
You'll have to kill me where I stand.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.510
If I wanted to kill you, senator,

18:09.550 --> 18:10.510
You'd be dead already.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.050
Now take a seat!

18:23.530 --> 18:24.830
You're a real enigma, Bauer.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.930
An hour after you save the
president from terrorists,

18:27.970 --> 18:30.430
You murder a federal
witness in cold blood.

18:30.470 --> 18:32.240
I didn't kill Burnett.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.610
This man did.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.132
Do you know who he is?

18:35.180 --> 18:36.210
No.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.340
His name is John Quinn.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.380
He works for Starkwood.

18:39.450 --> 18:42.240
What in the world does Starkwood
have to do with this?

18:42.280 --> 18:43.402
I don't know yet.

18:43.450 --> 18:45.430
But I do know they sent
someone to kill Burnett

18:45.470 --> 18:46.830
And frame me to cover up
their involvement

18:46.870 --> 18:48.120
In everything that's happened today,

18:48.160 --> 18:50.800
Including the attack on the white house.

18:52.390 --> 18:53.990
That's a hell of a theory, Bauer.

18:54.030 --> 18:56.360
But you'll have to spin
a better story than that

18:56.400 --> 18:58.190
If you expect it to get you
off the hook.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.130
Senator, I did not come
here to clear my name.

19:00.170 --> 19:01.940
I'm trying to understand

19:02.000 --> 19:04.130
The connection between
Juma and Starkwood.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.040
There isn't one.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.800
I've spent the better part of six months

19:09.840 --> 19:12.250
Investigating Starkwood.

19:12.310 --> 19:13.810
If there was a connection
to Juma or Sangala,

19:13.850 --> 19:14.840
I would know it.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.510
I want to see every file you have

19:16.550 --> 19:18.180
Concerning that investigation.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.950
Look…

19:22.020 --> 19:25.230
Starkwood has let their
security teams run amok

19:25.290 --> 19:29.030
All over the world, with no oversight.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.690
They've bribed their way
into large contracts,

19:30.730 --> 19:32.630
They've tried to influence
foreign policy

19:32.670 --> 19:35.030
To their own benefit— all good reasons

19:35.070 --> 19:37.000
Why this country should
not be outsourcing

19:37.040 --> 19:41.170
Its military operations
to private corporations.

19:41.240 --> 19:45.210
And I am going to shut them down.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.650
But there is nothing to remotely suggest

19:48.720 --> 19:52.080
They'd be involved in terrorist
attacks on their own country

19:52.120 --> 19:53.920
For any amount of money.

19:53.990 --> 19:56.520
Maybe they have different
reasons for helping Juma.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.090
Like what?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.590
I don't know.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.860
Sir, I believe this country
is still under attack,

20:01.900 --> 20:03.390
And there has to be a reason.

20:03.430 --> 20:08.512
And I'm supposed to believe this, Coming
from a man who's holding me hostage?

20:09.270 --> 20:11.184
I need access to those files.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.780
And if the connection

20:14.840 --> 20:17.850
Between Juma and Starkwood isn't there,

20:17.910 --> 20:20.910
Will you turn yourself in, then?

20:23.950 --> 20:26.390
Just open the files, sir.

20:42.470 --> 20:44.470
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:44.540 --> 20:47.430
The president will be making
a brief statement tonight.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.910
Good luck, mom.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.810
I'm sure you'll understand,

20:51.880 --> 20:53.710
Based on the events of today,

20:53.750 --> 20:56.410
There will be no opportunity
for follow-up questions.

20:56.450 --> 20:57.780
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:57.820 --> 21:00.790
The president of the United States.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.330
Thank you very much.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.930
Thank you.

21:17.770 --> 21:19.200
Thank you.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.240
My fellow Americans, John Adams,

21:25.310 --> 21:28.610
The first president to take up
residence in the white house,

21:28.650 --> 21:30.820
Once prayed for heaven to bestow

21:30.880 --> 21:32.820
Its blessings on this place.

21:32.890 --> 21:36.250
Tonight, those blessings
have seen us through

21:36.320 --> 21:39.990
A brutal attack by a desperate tyrant.

21:40.060 --> 21:43.000
We have lost friends
and loved ones here,

21:43.060 --> 21:45.700
But we have prevailed.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.060
I have commanded law
enforcement agencies,

21:48.100 --> 21:50.160
Emergency services and first responders

21:50.200 --> 21:51.460
To keep their deployment level…

21:51.500 --> 21:52.800
Mr Kanin, Ken Dellao, CNB.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.100
I'm wondering if you can
confirm some information

21:55.140 --> 21:56.600
I received a short time ago?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.300
Ken, this is clearly not the time…

21:58.340 --> 22:01.840
Yeah, I'm, I'm going to be Reporting
in this evening's broadcast

22:01.880 --> 22:03.810
That a rogue ex-federal
agent named Jack Bauer

22:03.850 --> 22:07.690
Is the prime suspect in the
murder of Ryan Burnett.

22:07.750 --> 22:10.460
cannot forget today's events.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.650
The lives we lost…

22:11.690 --> 22:12.950
Where did you get this?

22:12.990 --> 22:14.860
So, it's true, then?

22:14.930 --> 22:16.560
I'm not confirming anything.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.060
I'll also be reporting That you
authorized Bauer's release from custody

22:20.100 --> 22:24.040
And arranged for his access
to the victim.

22:24.100 --> 22:27.970
daughters and sons,
brothers and sisters,

22:28.040 --> 22:30.240
But they have not taken our spirit.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.050
Make no mistake, today's attacks

22:33.110 --> 22:34.840
Were intended to crush our resolve.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.250
Mr Kanin.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.720
I said no comment.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.750
But America is not so easily broken.

22:40.790 --> 22:44.960
Our military action in
Sangala has been a success.

22:45.020 --> 22:47.440
At this hour, our forces

22:47.440 --> 22:49.520
have taken control of Sangala city.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.730
We have won.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.590
I see you're back to your old tactics.

22:53.630 --> 22:55.270
What?

22:55.330 --> 22:57.260
You leaked the story of Burnett's murder

22:57.300 --> 22:58.800
And my involvement to the press.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.876
Ethan, I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:06.950 --> 23:10.120
Olivia, don't bother denying it.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.010
I can count on one hand
the number of people

23:12.050 --> 23:14.550
Who knew I'd authorized Bauer's release.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.790
So another one of your errors in

23:16.790 --> 23:18.860
judgment bites you have

23:18.920 --> 23:22.390
And you think you can lay
the blame on me.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.120
Do you realize what you've done?

23:24.160 --> 23:26.470
In trying to hurt me,

23:26.530 --> 23:29.730
You'll have caused tremendous
damage to your mother.

23:29.770 --> 23:32.200
The president has gone on record

23:32.270 --> 23:36.710
That torture is unacceptable
under any circumstances.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.570
When this gets out, it will
look like Bauer was sent

23:39.610 --> 23:40.640
Exactly for that.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.240
It'll be a political disaster.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.810
You've gone too far this time.

23:43.850 --> 23:45.810
I'm not listening to you anymore.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.510
I'm not going to let you
get away with this.

23:47.550 --> 23:49.250
Get your hands off me.

23:50.620 --> 23:53.060
As Americans,

23:53.130 --> 23:54.790
We should stand together proud

23:54.830 --> 23:56.020
Of what we have achieved.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.760
Thanks to the efforts and the sacrifices

23:59.830 --> 24:04.640
Of so many, this place,
our national home,

24:04.700 --> 24:07.510
Stands tall tonight.

24:07.570 --> 24:11.480
And all our citizens can sleep
soundly with the knowledge

24:11.540 --> 24:16.810
That the blessings of freedom
continue to shine upon us all.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.980
No, there's been no sign of
Bauer in the northeast sector,

24:20.020 --> 24:22.650
So expand your cordon
to the 25-mile mark.

24:22.690 --> 24:24.720
And be prepared to back up metro.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.420
I'm directing them to begin
random traffic stops, citywide.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.290
Thank you.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.360
I isolated the data Renée
uploaded to Bauer,

24:32.400 --> 24:34.060
But I can't get past the file header.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.430
What does that mean?

24:35.500 --> 24:37.230
She encrypted the name
and address she used,

24:37.270 --> 24:38.900
And I can't seem to crack it.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.200
You can't? She used her
personal computer.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.670
This is very serious encryption.

24:42.710 --> 24:46.310
I mean, there are some high-level
people who can do it. Like who?

24:46.350 --> 24:47.870
Chloe O'Brian— but from what you've

24:47.910 --> 24:49.410
told me, she's still loyal to Bauer.

24:49.450 --> 24:52.320
Is her husband still here?

24:52.320 --> 24:54.300
Yeah. He's waiting to see you.

24:54.550 --> 24:58.420
According to her file, he's
a level-six analyst, too.

24:58.420 --> 24:59.150
Yeah. He's waiting to see me.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.590
I have no idea how much
longer I'm going to be here.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.320
Just do me a favor and
give Prescott his babu

25:04.360 --> 25:05.720
Before you put him down.

25:05.760 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, I'm going to have
to call you back. Yeah.

25:10.070 --> 25:11.852
Mr O'Brian, I'm Larry Moss.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.670
Yeah, I'd like to see my wife.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.870
All right.

25:23.550 --> 25:25.550
What the bloody hell are you
holding her for?

25:25.590 --> 25:28.420
Obstruction, evidence tampering.

25:28.490 --> 25:30.380
I think you should be
more concerned about

25:30.420 --> 25:32.490
What you can do to get her out. Sorry?

25:32.530 --> 25:34.360
Help us find Jack Bauer.

25:34.430 --> 25:38.200
Last I heard from Chloe, Jack
was working for the bureau.

25:38.260 --> 25:39.590
That's you, if I'm not mistaken.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.200
He was.

25:41.270 --> 25:43.530
Until he snapped and murdered
a federal witness.

25:43.570 --> 25:44.940
Really?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.670
I find that hard to believe.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.330
All that's relevant here
is that your wife

25:48.370 --> 25:50.100
Is going to be prosecuted
for colluding with Bauer,

25:50.140 --> 25:51.700
Unless you help us find him.

25:51.740 --> 25:53.250
Mr O'Brian,

25:53.310 --> 25:55.080
A short time ago,

25:55.150 --> 25:57.040
One of our agents was
in touch with Jack Bauer.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.120
She sent a name and address

25:59.180 --> 26:00.880
That we assume is his next destination.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.720
Unfortunately, it's encrypted
with blowfish 148.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.190
No one here knows how to crack that.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.230
Therefore, we need your help.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.030
Please.

26:12.330 --> 26:15.230
Jack Bauer and my wife
have a very long history.

26:15.270 --> 26:17.060
I consider him to be a friend.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.730
And he'll have his day in court.

26:18.770 --> 26:20.070
But the case against your wife

26:20.110 --> 26:22.170
Is rock solid.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.510
I can't.

26:24.580 --> 26:28.610
We're talking about her serving
a minimum sentence of 15 years.

26:28.650 --> 26:32.280
Your son will be 19 by the
time she gets out of prison.

26:43.230 --> 26:47.570
I want guarantees of full immunity,

26:47.630 --> 26:50.630
No jail time, expulsion of
all charges from her record.

26:50.670 --> 26:51.730
You have my word.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.470
You are a witness to this agreement.

26:53.510 --> 26:54.440
Yes.

26:54.510 --> 26:56.910
Show me the file.

26:56.980 --> 26:58.070
Original information—

26:58.110 --> 27:00.850
16 or 32-bit word length?
Thirty-two.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.180
Native or modified data points?

27:04.220 --> 27:06.620
Native.

27:06.690 --> 27:11.090
The designer of this algorithm

27:11.160 --> 27:12.750
Built a backdoor into his code.

27:12.790 --> 27:15.020
Decryption's a piece of cake if
you know the override codes.

27:15.060 --> 27:16.230
And you do?

27:16.300 --> 27:18.100
Yeah.

27:18.160 --> 27:20.030
Will this take long?

27:20.100 --> 27:21.800
Course not.

27:25.170 --> 27:27.270
Mr O'Brian, can you tell me specifically

27:27.310 --> 27:29.440
When you'll have the file decrypted?

27:29.480 --> 27:31.510
Yes.

27:34.210 --> 27:35.450
Now.

27:35.510 --> 27:38.060
Your agent sent Jack to

27:38.060 --> 27:40.620
951 Deerbrook avenue, Georgetown,

27:40.690 --> 27:42.850
Residence of senator Blaine Mayer.

27:42.890 --> 27:44.790
Assemble the field teams.

27:44.860 --> 27:48.090
Tell them we have
a probable location on Bauer.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.500
And get metro pd on the way.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.560
No luck reaching Mayer on his cell

28:06.600 --> 28:07.690
or at the house.

28:07.760 --> 28:08.880
The phone company said

28:08.920 --> 28:10.320
The line was shorted out on-site.

28:10.360 --> 28:11.420
Yeah, that's Bauer.

28:11.460 --> 28:12.846
Why is he doing this?

28:12.860 --> 28:14.220
Because Mayer spent the last six months

28:14.260 --> 28:16.390
Trying to send Bauer to prison
for the rest of his life.

28:16.430 --> 28:20.630
All right, metro pd is closing
in on Mayer's residence.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.030
I've authorized them to move in

28:22.070 --> 28:23.970
As soon as they're in position
and at strength.

28:24.010 --> 28:28.640
I told them, and I'm telling you, it
is impossible to overestimate Bauer.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.640
He has more training and more experience

28:30.680 --> 28:32.640
Than anybody in this room,
and that includes myself.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.020
Okay, let's move.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.440
Agent Moss will be running
on-point tactical

28:37.480 --> 28:38.880
with FBI teams on five.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.420
All units must register and
log their com through me,

28:41.460 --> 28:45.530
And I will distribute recognition
codes and credentials.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.620
Chloe… I can't believe you.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.190
You're helping them catch Jack.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.700
I did it for you.

28:53.770 --> 28:55.500
This is the last thing
I would have wanted.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.400
How could you do this?
Let's see, for a start,

28:57.440 --> 28:59.270
I thought it might be nice
to spare Prescott

28:59.310 --> 29:02.440
The inconvenience of having
a convict for a mother.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.270
Jack saved your life. I don't deny
that I owe him.

29:05.310 --> 29:10.050
But my child and my marriage
comes first,

29:10.120 --> 29:12.350
And it should for you, too.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.880
Chloe, love, you've helped Jack enough.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.720
You have.

29:16.790 --> 29:22.400
And you can't go deciding to
make this sacrifice on your own.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.190
But he didn't do what
they're saying he did.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.960
Then he can prove that when
they take him into custody.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.670
If they give him the chance.

29:46.190 --> 29:50.120
At the hearing this morning,
you said you had no regrets

29:50.190 --> 29:51.760
About what you've done.

29:51.830 --> 29:55.730
But what I saw was a man full of regret.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.230
Of course I have regrets, senator.

30:01.240 --> 30:04.070
I regret losing my family.

30:04.140 --> 30:07.100
My wife was murdered
because I was responsible

30:07.140 --> 30:12.180
For protecting David Palmer
during an assassination attempt.

30:12.250 --> 30:14.310
My daughter can't even look at me.

30:14.350 --> 30:17.420
Every day, I regret looking
into the eyes

30:17.480 --> 30:19.262
Of men, women and children,

30:19.320 --> 30:20.680
Knowing that, any moment,

30:20.720 --> 30:22.820
Their lives might be deemed expendable

30:22.860 --> 30:24.820
In an effort to protect the greater good.

30:24.860 --> 30:29.630
I regret every decision or
mistake I might have made

30:29.700 --> 30:33.500
That resulted in the loss
of a single innocent life.

30:33.570 --> 30:36.670
But you know what I regret the most?

30:36.740 --> 30:40.440
Is that this world even needs
people like me.

30:40.510 --> 30:44.240
So you think I'm naive to believe

30:44.310 --> 30:46.610
We need to hold ourselves to
a higher standard of combat?

30:46.650 --> 30:49.580
Doesn't even matter
what I think, senator.

30:49.650 --> 30:51.310
You just need to understand
where I work,

30:51.350 --> 30:55.112
Things get a lot messier than
where you work on the hill.

30:55.720 --> 30:59.360
What you've lost, Mr. Bauer, is tragic.

30:59.430 --> 31:01.420
What you've been compelled to do

31:01.460 --> 31:05.030
In the name of saving innocent life is tragic.

31:05.100 --> 31:10.300
Sometimes we need to incur
the most horrible losses

31:10.370 --> 31:12.510
In order to uphold the ideals

31:12.570 --> 31:14.500
That this country was founded on.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.340
How can we presume to lead the world

31:17.410 --> 31:20.080
Unless we set an example?

31:22.250 --> 31:23.880
You make it sound so simple.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.810
Well, maybe it's simpler than you think.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.820
Maybe all the things that you've seen

31:27.860 --> 31:31.952
And all the things that you've
done have cloud of your vision.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.700
Look at this.

31:39.870 --> 31:41.400
Tell me about this car accident.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.500
That has nothing to do with Juma.

31:43.540 --> 31:44.794
Who was the victim?

31:44.840 --> 31:46.130
A source inside of Starkwood.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.470
A whistle-blower.

31:47.540 --> 31:48.970
Unfortunately, he was also a drunk.

31:49.010 --> 31:51.070
He was killed when he wrecked his car

31:51.110 --> 31:52.510
On the way home from Atlantic City.

31:52.550 --> 31:54.910
Blood alcohol off the charts.

31:59.950 --> 32:01.720
Senator, this was no accident.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.750
Your informant was murdered by the same man

32:03.790 --> 32:05.420
Who took Ryan Burnett out this evening.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.820
What does this mean, Bauer?

32:06.860 --> 32:09.090
They were scared of what he had to say.

32:09.130 --> 32:10.620
What does your informant have on Starkwood?

32:10.660 --> 32:11.960
He made a lot of wild accusations,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
But not a single one of them panned out.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.560
Maybe you didn't dig deep enough.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.560
Senator, I need to know exactly what he told you.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.710
He alleged that Starkwood

32:19.770 --> 32:21.400
Was blackmailing Pentagon officials.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.770
That they were involved in assassination plots.

32:23.810 --> 32:26.370
Even that they were seeking
to acquire their own WMDs.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.680
Specifically what?

32:27.750 --> 32:29.440
Well, I don't remember, but I'm sure

32:29.480 --> 32:32.516
That his interview transcript should be there.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.760
Okay, I got it.

32:35.820 --> 32:38.020
Oh, my God.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.190
That's it.

32:39.260 --> 32:40.330
What?

32:40.390 --> 32:41.520
Your informant claims that Starkwood

32:41.560 --> 32:43.220
Was trying to acquire a bio-weapon.

32:43.260 --> 32:44.630
That's your connection to Juma.

32:44.670 --> 32:45.660
I don't understand.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.430
When Juma was in power, it was rumored

32:47.470 --> 32:49.500
That he was running an illegal weapons program.

32:49.540 --> 32:51.270
He was developing a bio-weapon,

32:51.310 --> 32:52.470
But nobody could prove it.

32:52.510 --> 32:54.140
But the people that I knew in Sangala

32:54.180 --> 32:56.940
Believed he was testing these
weapons on his own population.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.210
He used a remote village,

32:58.250 --> 32:59.640
Released some kind of pathogen.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.880
Everyone there was struck with dementia,

33:01.920 --> 33:04.120
Paralysis and eventually died.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.774
Why wasn't this pursued?

33:05.790 --> 33:07.180
'cause Juma destroyed all the evidence.

33:07.220 --> 33:08.620
He firebombed the village before anyone

33:08.660 --> 33:10.350
Could get there, and un officials

33:10.390 --> 33:12.820
Had a hard time believing
that Juma had the technology

33:12.860 --> 33:14.960
Or expertise to develop such a weapon.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.560
But Starkwood… they had both.

33:17.630 --> 33:19.690
The technology and the expertise.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.900
And what did Juma have to offer Starkwood?

33:21.940 --> 33:23.830
A safe haven to develop the weapon

33:23.870 --> 33:26.630
And an endless supply of victims to test it on.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.940
Even if all this was true, why in the world

33:30.010 --> 33:32.254
Would Starkwood want a bio-weapon?

33:32.280 --> 33:35.010
Senator, you've been trying
to dismantle Starkwood

33:35.050 --> 33:36.634
For the last six months.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.680
Maybe they planned on fighting back.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.780
But regardless, if they have a weapon like this,

33:40.820 --> 33:43.526
You better believe they intend to use it.

33:44.830 --> 33:45.930
Senator Mayer!

33:45.990 --> 33:46.950
This is metro pd!

33:46.990 --> 33:49.000
Don't you move.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.270
Hold on. Hold on!

33:56.740 --> 33:58.230
You're obviously on to something.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.540
They can help you

33:59.610 --> 34:01.770
Find the evidence you need to prove your case.

34:01.810 --> 34:04.170
Right now everyone thinks I killed Ryan Burnett.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.310
–No one's gonna listen to me.
–I can protect you.

34:06.350 --> 34:07.810
I can order them to help us.

34:07.850 --> 34:09.139
Starkwood infiltrated the white house.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.510
As soon as they find out you're going after them

34:11.550 --> 34:13.150
For a bio-weapon, they'll bury the evidence.

34:13.190 --> 34:15.960
Then we'll keep the circle small.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.889
I can make this happen.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.389
It's time for you to start
trusting the institutions

34:20.429 --> 34:23.860
That you've sacrificed so much to protect.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.909
Trust isn't my greatest asset.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.540
Son, you have to start somewhere.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.670
Senator!

34:31.739 --> 34:33.409
This is metro pd!

34:33.469 --> 34:35.648
You really think you can do this?

34:35.679 --> 34:37.480
I know I can.

34:39.449 --> 34:41.449
Let 'em in.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.250
Coming!

34:54.929 --> 34:56.659
No!

35:53.590 --> 35:54.790
You wanted to see me?

35:54.830 --> 35:57.760
Yes, Livy.

35:59.100 --> 36:00.660
Ethan just come to me with
something very disturbing.

36:00.700 --> 36:04.396
I assume it's about the press
leak regarding Jack Bauer.

36:05.170 --> 36:08.230
Ethan seems to think you had
something to do with it.

36:08.270 --> 36:09.610
I didn't.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.310
I already told him that.

36:11.380 --> 36:13.010
Well, given the past experience

36:13.050 --> 36:15.340
Between the two of you, he's not convinced.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.480
And what do you think?

36:17.550 --> 36:20.410
I think I need to hear what you have to say.

36:20.450 --> 36:22.350
There's nothing she can say, madam president.

36:22.390 --> 36:24.180
She was one of the few people

36:24.220 --> 36:25.750
Who knew all the details.

36:25.790 --> 36:28.660
More people knew than you think.

36:28.730 --> 36:30.580
I just got off the phone with the

36:30.620 --> 36:32.260
white house secretary producer

36:32.300 --> 36:33.400
At CNB.

36:33.470 --> 36:35.030
He won't give me the source's name,

36:35.070 --> 36:36.260
But he's willing to confirm

36:36.300 --> 36:38.430
That the leak came from
someone inside the federal

36:38.470 --> 36:39.870
Marshal's office.

36:39.940 --> 36:42.440
He'll guarantee it didn't
come from the white house,

36:42.480 --> 36:43.880
Or from me.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.280
This is verifiable?

36:48.980 --> 36:51.110
Producer's name is Charlie Isakson.

36:51.150 --> 36:52.780
Here's his number.

36:52.850 --> 36:55.490
You can call him yourself if you'd like.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.460
I offered Isakson some

37:03.500 --> 37:05.320
Exclusive time with you if he killed the story,

37:05.360 --> 37:07.100
And he agreed.

37:07.170 --> 37:09.130
So as long as we get Bauer in custody,

37:09.170 --> 37:12.338
We should be able to keep the fallout contained.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.230
Ethan, under the circumstances,

37:14.270 --> 37:16.110
I think it seems clear

37:16.180 --> 37:18.180
That you were mistaken.

37:19.650 --> 37:21.580
I'm satisfied.

37:21.650 --> 37:22.750
Are you?

37:22.810 --> 37:25.220
Yes, madam president.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.720
I'm sorry, Olivia,

37:26.790 --> 37:28.620
If I misjudged

37:28.690 --> 37:30.320
The situation…

37:30.390 --> 37:31.790
And you.

37:31.860 --> 37:34.230
I want to know

37:34.290 --> 37:36.590
If the FBI's any closer to finding Bauer.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.160
Yes, ma'am.

37:38.230 --> 37:40.530
That's all.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.680
I'm sorry

37:50.740 --> 37:53.440
–I put you on the spot like that.
–I understand.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.440
Ethan didn't give you much of a choice.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.610
I just hope

37:56.680 --> 37:59.518
They find Bauer before this gets any worse.

41:17.780 --> 41:19.380
You're dying.

41:19.450 --> 41:21.020
Just tell me where

41:21.090 --> 41:23.290
The weapons are coming in.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.360
When are they getting here?

41:26.390 --> 41:28.190
They're already here.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.000
Janis, it's Larry.

42:06.060 --> 42:07.900
We got here too late.

42:07.970 --> 42:09.760
Bauer murdered senator Mayer.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.400
Escalate the search for him to region-wide.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.530
I want reinforcements from every branch

42:14.570 --> 42:16.600
Within 50 miles brought into this.

42:16.640 --> 42:17.640
Copy that.

42:17.710 --> 42:18.910
At this point…

42:18.980 --> 42:22.310
Orders are to shoot on sight.

42:25.550 --> 42:26.780
Yeah.

42:26.850 --> 42:28.050
Tony, it's Jack.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.880
Jack, I've been monitoring
the FBI bandwidth.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.320
What the hell's going on?

42:31.360 --> 42:33.250
Listen, man, I need your help. Where are you?

42:33.290 --> 42:34.660
3rd street and b.

42:34.730 --> 42:36.020
Okay, listen to me, I need you

42:36.060 --> 42:37.520
To meet me at the port of Alexandria.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.590
I need you to bring a weapons
and a surveillance package.

42:39.630 --> 42:41.690
–Get there as soon as possible.
–Jack, wait.

42:41.730 --> 42:45.470
I can't. I'll get back to you
as soon as I'm en route.
