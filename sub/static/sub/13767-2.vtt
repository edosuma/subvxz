WEBVTT

00:02.878 --> 00:05.380
Nine days

00:02.878 --> 00:05.380
past expiration.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.635
Ugh!

00:09.677 --> 00:11.094
Here.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.183
Ugh! Turned carbonated.

00:19.895 --> 00:22.940
Expired two months ago.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.484
You don't have the guts.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.991
(coughing)

00:38.747 --> 00:41.082
When was the last

00:38.747 --> 00:41.082
Christmas we had eggnog?

00:41.124 --> 00:42.918
I think before Dewey.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.717
It's all you, man.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.093
(gagging)

00:52.135 --> 00:54.972
This is a game that

00:52.135 --> 00:54.972
has no winners.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.889
Well, that's the last

01:33.260 --> 01:36.889
of my Halloween candy.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.142
All that sugar,

01:38.473 --> 01:41.142
all those cavities.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.353
We're the real

01:41.184 --> 01:43.353
winners, guys.

01:44.563 --> 01:47.148
Are you coming over

01:44.563 --> 01:47.148
Saturday?

01:47.190 --> 01:48.525
For what?

01:48.567 --> 01:50.151
For what?!

01:50.193 --> 01:51.779
The Leonid meteor shower!

01:51.820 --> 01:53.154
Only once

01:51.820 --> 01:53.154
in a lifetime

01:53.196 --> 01:54.990
do the mighty

01:53.196 --> 01:54.990
Leonids reveal

01:55.032 --> 01:57.158
their full beauty

01:55.032 --> 01:57.158
before bedtime.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.243
I wish I could, guys,

01:58.285 --> 01:59.787
but Francis is coming

01:58.285 --> 01:59.787
home this weekend.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.413
And since he missed

01:59.828 --> 02:01.413
Halloween last week,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.164
we're going to

02:01.455 --> 02:03.164
hang out together.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.332
Are you sure?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.334
Stevie has

02:04.374 --> 02:06.334
a new telescope,

02:06.376 --> 02:10.047
and I was thinking that

02:06.376 --> 02:10.047
after the meteor shower

02:10.089 --> 02:12.424
we could watch

02:10.089 --> 02:12.424
Mrs. Feldman shower.

02:12.466 --> 02:16.386
And you call yourself

02:12.466 --> 02:16.386
a scientist.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.268
It's been

02:22.059 --> 02:23.268
a week, sweetie.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.227
Take off the costume.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.353
But I like it.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.188
It's filthy. Come here.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.398
(groans)

02:31.318 --> 02:33.654
Go put some clothes on,

02:31.318 --> 02:33.654
sweetie.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.697
(groaning)

02:42.121 --> 02:43.204
(chuckling)

02:43.246 --> 02:45.082
What you doing?

02:43.246 --> 02:45.082
I don't know.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.793
There's something about the way

02:45.124 --> 02:47.793
you swish that brush around

02:47.835 --> 02:49.128
that just drives me...

02:49.168 --> 02:50.211
(car engine revving,

02:49.168 --> 02:50.211
tires squealing)

02:50.253 --> 02:51.755
Damn! That blue car!

02:55.050 --> 02:57.011
That's three times this week.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.929
That joyriding son of a...

02:58.971 --> 03:00.806
Hal, just call the police.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.849
I have.

03:01.890 --> 03:02.808
They won't do anything.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.309
Lois, I swear,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.309
one of these days,

03:04.351 --> 03:05.853
I'm going to catch up

03:04.351 --> 03:05.853
to that punk,

03:05.894 --> 03:07.604
I'm going to

03:05.894 --> 03:07.604
drag him out of his car,

03:07.646 --> 03:09.314
and I'm going

03:07.646 --> 03:09.314
to beat him senseless

03:09.356 --> 03:11.733
until he understands

03:09.356 --> 03:11.733
that there's a certain thing

03:11.775 --> 03:13.234
called the law.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.445
Don't let him get to you.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.445
Come on.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.531
Well, when's it going to stop?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.407
When Dewey here is smashed

03:19.449 --> 03:21.869
into a lifeless pulp?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.705
Put some clothes on, son.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.790
(groans)

03:30.335 --> 03:33.254
Halloween sucked this year

03:30.335 --> 03:33.254
without Francis.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.049
The eggs and shaving

03:33.296 --> 03:35.049
cream I can keep.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.010
But what am I ever going

03:35.090 --> 03:38.010
to do with this stuff?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.887
It was supposed to be

03:39.928 --> 03:41.555
our first Halloween

03:39.928 --> 03:41.555
as mindless vandals.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.431
But Francis got in trouble

03:41.596 --> 03:43.431
at school,

03:43.473 --> 03:45.266
so we had to go

03:43.473 --> 03:45.266
trick-or-treating

03:45.308 --> 03:46.518
like a bunch

03:45.308 --> 03:46.518
of little kids.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.187
Oh, look at you three.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.270
What are you?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.522
A beat-up hillbilly.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.524
And you?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.524
Just give us the candy.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.275
Oh, I bet you're a ghost.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.485
I'm a marshmallow.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.945
Oh, and a cute one at that.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.156
I just want to stick a fork

03:56.987 --> 03:59.156
in your belly

03:59.198 --> 04:00.281
and roast you

03:59.198 --> 04:00.281
over an open flame

04:00.323 --> 04:02.701
till you're

04:00.323 --> 04:02.701
nice and crispy.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.120
It's embarrassing

04:02.743 --> 04:05.120
at our age--

04:05.162 --> 04:07.288
coming home with candy.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.707
Give me that.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.294
Hey!

04:13.336 --> 04:15.380
Hey! Hey!

04:17.049 --> 04:19.760
Pull over, you gutless...

04:22.971 --> 04:25.682
I got kids!

04:25.724 --> 04:27.059
You lousy...

04:28.977 --> 04:31.312
...son of a...

04:32.397 --> 04:34.399
(screams, groans)

04:35.567 --> 04:37.527
This guy is a menace.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.529
Now, I've tried to

04:37.569 --> 04:39.529
get him on my own,

04:39.571 --> 04:42.323
but the truth is,

04:39.571 --> 04:42.323
it's not a job for one man.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.534
It is a community problem,

04:44.576 --> 04:46.327
and all we have to do

04:46.369 --> 04:48.038
is work together.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.207
If we all keep an eye out

04:48.080 --> 04:50.207
for this guy,

04:50.249 --> 04:53.252
I think we should be able

04:50.249 --> 04:53.252
to catch him pretty quickly.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.711
Why don't you

04:53.293 --> 04:54.711
clean up your yard?

04:54.753 --> 04:56.213
(others agreeing)

04:54.753 --> 04:56.213
What?

04:56.255 --> 04:59.216
Why don't you just move?

04:59.258 --> 05:00.717
Look, this isn't about me.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.385
These meetings are

05:00.759 --> 05:02.385
always about you.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.845
You're the sole

05:02.427 --> 05:03.845
reason we meet.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.722
Those kids of yours

05:03.887 --> 05:05.722
should be in jail.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.058
How would you like it

05:05.764 --> 05:08.058
if you scrimped and saved

05:08.100 --> 05:10.351
all your life to live

05:08.100 --> 05:10.351
in a nice neighborhood,

05:10.393 --> 05:13.396
and then a bunch

05:10.393 --> 05:13.396
of godless monsters moved in

05:13.438 --> 05:15.190
and destroyed

05:13.438 --> 05:15.190
all your dreams?

05:16.566 --> 05:18.526
Okay, back to the subject.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.526
I'd like to pass around

05:18.568 --> 05:20.737
a sign-up sheet for a stakeout.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.864
(laughter)

05:24.199 --> 05:28.162
Well... thanks for your time.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.412
MAN:

05:28.203 --> 05:29.412
You're welcome.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.290
(quiet murmuring)

05:32.415 --> 05:33.625
Hello?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.418
LOIS:

05:33.667 --> 05:35.418
Hi, Francis.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.045
Welcome home.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.966
Too old to hug your mom?

05:41.008 --> 05:41.842
Mom, I've been waiting

05:41.883 --> 05:43.384
at the bus station

05:41.883 --> 05:43.384
for three hours.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.053
Why didn't anybody

05:43.426 --> 05:45.053
come to pick me up?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.180
What?

05:46.221 --> 05:48.223
I sent your father.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.437
Oh, Francis, I'm sorry.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.274
He's battling his archenemy.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.109
What, the squirrel's back?

05:59.151 --> 06:01.987
No, it's a human this time.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.404
MALCOLM:

06:02.029 --> 06:03.404
Francis!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.073
Hey!

06:05.115 --> 06:06.992
Did you guys tear it up

06:05.115 --> 06:06.992
on Halloween?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.702
Oh, yeah.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.702
We were out of control.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.620
Kids were running;

06:08.743 --> 06:10.620
people were screaming;

06:10.662 --> 06:13.623
babies were crying.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.417
We went trick-or-treating.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.419
It just didn't feel

06:16.459 --> 06:18.419
right without you.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.005
I had fun.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.005
Shut up, Dewey.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.423
Couldn't you have gotten

06:20.047 --> 06:22.423
in trouble after Halloween?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.009
Guys, I'm sorry.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.426
I know I let you down,

06:25.468 --> 06:27.428
but I really didn't

06:25.468 --> 06:27.428
have a choice.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.807
The commandant's fake leg was

06:27.470 --> 06:30.807
just lying there in the closet

06:30.849 --> 06:33.143
begging for a novelty

06:30.849 --> 06:33.143
bumper sticker.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.435
It was a snap decision,

06:34.477 --> 06:36.230
but I really think

06:34.477 --> 06:36.230
I did the right thing.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.439
That's all right.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.439
There's always next year.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.650
Well, why do we have

06:38.481 --> 06:40.650
to wait a year?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.278
Guys, Halloween

06:43.320 --> 06:45.239
isn't a date

06:43.320 --> 06:45.239
on the calendar.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.240
Yeah, it is.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.657
It's the 31st.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.451
No, Halloween is in your hearts.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.288
Every time a little kid

06:50.493 --> 06:53.288
cries in fear,

06:53.330 --> 06:54.706
that's Halloween.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.542
Every time something repulsive

06:57.584 --> 07:00.879
ends up in a mailbox,

06:57.584 --> 07:00.879
that is Halloween.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.174
As long as you carry

07:00.921 --> 07:04.174
the spirit of destruction

07:04.216 --> 07:08.262
and vandalism in your hearts,

07:04.216 --> 07:08.262
every day is Halloween.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.264
No, look, it is the 31st.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.932
(sighs)

07:13.225 --> 07:16.895
Men, we are going to have

07:13.225 --> 07:16.895
Halloween this weekend.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.529
Hal, you have been out

07:24.152 --> 07:26.529
here for seven hours.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.864
Come to bed.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.158
Look, Lois, I am

07:27.906 --> 07:30.158
doing this for the boys.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.161
We can't just let our street

07:30.200 --> 07:33.161
become a speedway.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.662
Got to protect my family,

07:34.704 --> 07:36.581
even if it means

07:34.704 --> 07:36.581
sitting in this van

07:36.623 --> 07:38.208
every night for a month.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.294
It's a matter of principle.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.962
Mmm. Before you go to sleep,

07:42.003 --> 07:44.131
I'd like you

07:42.003 --> 07:44.131
to replace my pee jar.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.216
(grunts, clears throat)

07:55.558 --> 07:58.395
(gasping)

08:00.147 --> 08:01.606
No!

08:01.648 --> 08:03.524
Son of a...

08:06.486 --> 08:07.528
(gasps)

08:07.570 --> 08:10.991
(yells)

08:11.032 --> 08:13.034
(sobbing)

08:23.586 --> 08:25.755
Boys, the time has come.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.343
You're about to see the device

08:29.384 --> 08:32.387
that will change

08:29.384 --> 08:32.387
the face of Halloween forever.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.183
Behold.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.605
That's not

08:39.644 --> 08:42.605
a flying chocolate maker.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.359
This is just

08:42.647 --> 08:45.359
a bunch of tubes.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.567
Trust me.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.568
I do trust you,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.612
but I expected something

08:47.610 --> 08:49.612
a little more...

08:49.654 --> 08:51.572
Oh, my God.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.572
Will this work?

08:51.614 --> 08:52.573
Absolutely.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.368
What? What is it?

08:54.409 --> 08:56.495
It looks like an

08:54.409 --> 08:56.495
incredibly powerful slingshot.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.665
A slingshot capable of hurling

08:56.536 --> 09:00.665
objects over a distance

09:00.707 --> 09:03.418
of two city blocks.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.505
Picture yourself--

09:06.546 --> 09:07.881
you're walking down the street,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.590
you're minding

09:07.922 --> 09:09.590
your own business,

09:09.632 --> 09:11.676
when all of a sudden... bam!

09:09.632 --> 09:11.676
(gasping)

09:11.718 --> 09:13.594
You're hit

09:11.718 --> 09:13.594
by a ten-pound balloon

09:13.636 --> 09:15.222
filled with shaving cream,

09:13.636 --> 09:15.222
paint

09:15.263 --> 09:17.598
or any number

09:15.263 --> 09:17.598
of foul-smelling liquids.

09:19.642 --> 09:24.398
And you never,

09:19.642 --> 09:24.398
ever know who did it.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.441
It's the perfect

09:24.439 --> 09:26.441
weapon.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.028
Reese, are you crying?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.821
No.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.866
(rustling, clattering outside)

09:39.371 --> 09:41.456
(groans)

09:45.668 --> 09:47.795
What are you doing?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.630
I've had it, Lois.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.632
I'm building a speed bump.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.634
Hal, would you look

09:51.674 --> 09:53.634
at yourself?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.011
It's 4:00 in the morning.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.637
You're out here

09:55.053 --> 09:56.637
in your pajamas

09:56.679 --> 09:58.306
mixing cement

09:56.679 --> 09:58.306
in a wheelbarrow.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.017
It's going to rip the suspension

09:58.348 --> 10:01.017
right out from under him.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.810
There'll be some

10:01.059 --> 10:02.810
chassis damage.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.645
Oh, boy, I'd hate

10:02.852 --> 10:04.645
to be the one

10:04.687 --> 10:06.647
who has to realign

10:04.687 --> 10:06.647
his connecting rods.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.066
(sighs)

10:08.108 --> 10:10.651
That guy's not going

10:08.108 --> 10:10.651
to know what hit him.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.946
(car engine revving)

10:12.987 --> 10:13.988
Yee-ha!

10:20.703 --> 10:23.373
Okay, we got eggs,

10:23.415 --> 10:26.667
shaving cream, water balloons.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.087
I don't know,

10:26.709 --> 10:29.087
I'm just not feeling it.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.671
These eggs are

10:29.129 --> 10:30.671
pretty rotten.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.174
Yeah, I know,

10:30.713 --> 10:33.174
but it's all just so...

10:33.216 --> 10:34.675
standard.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.055
I mean, we have a whole new

10:36.761 --> 10:39.055
breed of weapon here.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.681
We need to live up to that.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.017
We need to start thinking

10:40.723 --> 10:43.017
outside the box.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.417
So if you'll just spend

11:05.123 --> 11:07.417
a couple of hours

11:07.459 --> 11:08.293
waiting for him here,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.378
I know the guy

11:08.335 --> 11:10.378
will come racing by,

11:10.420 --> 11:11.588
and then you can

11:10.420 --> 11:11.588
arrest him

11:11.630 --> 11:14.299
and this whole thing

11:11.630 --> 11:14.299
will be over once and for all.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.301
I want some help

11:14.341 --> 11:16.301
protecting my family.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.928
So you weren't held up

11:16.343 --> 11:18.928
at gunpoint?

11:20.472 --> 11:21.722
Okay, that was a lie.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.724
But I've been calling

11:21.764 --> 11:23.724
you people for weeks

11:23.766 --> 11:24.976
and not getting

11:23.766 --> 11:24.976
any help.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.727
No one is listening to me.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.771
Is this your speed bump?

11:33.860 --> 11:36.363
It was a good bump, Hal.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.074
(grunting)

11:43.411 --> 11:45.372
You want a sandwich?

11:51.169 --> 11:52.462
Easy.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.636
Good.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.346
Just let me talk to him.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.057
I'll get this whole thing

12:01.388 --> 12:04.057
straightened out in two minutes.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.983
Get the car.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.909
(hammering)

12:27.247 --> 12:29.416
Let's go through

12:27.247 --> 12:29.416
this one more time.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.791
Malcolm,

12:29.457 --> 12:30.791
what's your job?

12:30.833 --> 12:31.668
Aimer.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.669
Reese?

12:31.710 --> 12:32.669
Loader.

12:32.711 --> 12:33.794
Dewey, what do you do

12:33.836 --> 12:35.255
if you see Mom

12:33.836 --> 12:35.255
and Dad coming?

12:35.296 --> 12:37.632
(screeching)

12:40.677 --> 12:41.802
Excellent.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.097
Where'd they

12:41.844 --> 12:44.097
go, anyway?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.394
Okay, look--

12:46.849 --> 12:49.394
we've got his license plate.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.811
We've got his address.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.397
That's more than enough

12:50.853 --> 12:52.397
to get...

12:52.439 --> 12:53.690
Hal!

12:55.650 --> 12:56.735
What are you doing?

12:56.775 --> 12:58.194
Shh. Get down.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.820
I'm letting the air

12:58.236 --> 12:59.820
out of his tires.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.698
No, Hal.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.617
Okay, but then

13:01.740 --> 13:03.617
we go home.

13:03.658 --> 13:04.701
Hello.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.497
I have an idea.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.625
You can't steal his car.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.209
I'm not stealing his car.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.919
I'm just taking it

13:13.251 --> 13:14.919
elsewhere for a while.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.421
It'll teach the kid a lesson.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.547
No, Hal.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.840
I'm putting the key

13:17.589 --> 13:19.840
in the lock.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.840
No, Hal.

13:19.882 --> 13:20.841
I'm opening the door.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.051
No, Hal.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.844
I'm getting in the car.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.844
No.

13:23.886 --> 13:24.929
I am turning on the engine.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.098
(engine revving)

13:27.140 --> 13:30.143
Oh, ow. Just... (groans)

13:30.184 --> 13:31.519
(gasping)

13:31.561 --> 13:32.853
This is crazy.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.689
You can't just take

13:32.895 --> 13:34.689
a person's car.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.899
There are laws...!

13:34.731 --> 13:36.899
(screams)

13:36.941 --> 13:38.777
(gasping)

13:38.817 --> 13:42.322
Oh. Oh... serious engine.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.575
He must have bored out

13:42.363 --> 13:45.575
the cylinders in this puppy.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.867
Pull over.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.453
Remember that Maverick

13:46.909 --> 13:48.453
I used to have?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.455
I don't want to talk

13:48.495 --> 13:50.455
about your old muscle car.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.872
(engine roars)

13:51.914 --> 13:54.167
(both gasping)

13:54.208 --> 13:55.876
Scared?

13:55.918 --> 13:56.919
Of course I'm scared.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.380
You've turned into

13:56.961 --> 13:59.380
a crazy person.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.926
Do it again.

14:04.927 --> 14:05.886
Oh!

14:08.306 --> 14:10.308
All right, let's

14:08.306 --> 14:10.308
try a test shot.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.728
Reese, just get me

14:10.350 --> 14:13.728
a small water balloon.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.105
Malcolm, you got me a target?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.449
We've got a target.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.911
Listen, you idiot, the optics

14:27.950 --> 14:30.911
on the Newtonian reflector

14:30.953 --> 14:32.913
don't even approach

14:30.953 --> 14:32.913
a Schmidt-Cassegrain.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.124
It's a nice century--

and go home

17:27.129 --> 17:28.088
was, like, 20 miles ago.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.090
What if we just kept going?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.091
What are you talking about?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.552
I'm talking about you and me

17:32.593 --> 17:34.554
running away and spending

17:32.593 --> 17:34.554
the rest of our lives

17:34.595 --> 17:38.098
on some... I don't know,

17:34.595 --> 17:38.098
some hidden beach in Mexico

17:38.140 --> 17:40.894
with no jobs and no kids.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.103
Oh, it's not that simple, Hal.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.898
Why not?

17:44.939 --> 17:47.942
I mean, we would have

17:44.939 --> 17:47.942
to change our names, but...

17:49.151 --> 17:51.946
I'd be Raul.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.990
You'd be Consuela.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.115
Consuela?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.951
Sí.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.125
You think they'd send

18:02.832 --> 18:05.125
the  federales  after us?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.377
Huh! Of course.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.546
But they'd

18:06.419 --> 18:08.546
never find us.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.964
We'd be outlaws.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.298
Oh, we'd be legends.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.133
We'd be living

18:11.340 --> 18:13.133
every parent's dream.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.385
We'd be folk heroes.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.012
Like Bonnie and Clyde.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.972
Raul and Consuela.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.017
Spearing fish.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.977
Climbing for coconuts.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.145
Living naked as monkeys.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.648
Oh... Raul.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.324
(car alarm blaring,

18:35.281 --> 18:37.324
people screaming)

18:37.366 --> 18:38.576
ALL:

18:37.366 --> 18:38.576
Yeah!

18:38.618 --> 18:40.327
I think I speak

18:38.618 --> 18:40.327
for all of us

18:40.369 --> 18:42.038
when I say

18:40.369 --> 18:42.038
that tonight ruled!

18:42.080 --> 18:43.163
Totally.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.248
We own you all.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.416
No one is safe.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.334
We are the kings

18:45.458 --> 18:47.334
of this block.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.169
Did you hear me, world?

18:49.211 --> 18:52.673
Violence just got

18:49.211 --> 18:52.673
a little more random!

18:57.095 --> 18:58.846
Reload! Reload!

19:00.222 --> 19:01.348
This is incredible.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.850
Their accuracy

19:01.390 --> 19:02.850
is amazing.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.060
Make it stop!

19:04.102 --> 19:05.436
Who are these guys?

19:08.064 --> 19:09.356
It's tofu.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.568
Angle: 47.9 degrees.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.694
Check.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.572
Brakes locked.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.199
This is for

19:16.614 --> 19:19.199
all the times

19:19.241 --> 19:22.036
I've been called

19:19.241 --> 19:22.036
"butt-tweefer."

19:22.078 --> 19:23.079
Fire!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.499
What do you mean,

19:25.247 --> 19:26.499
Krelboynes?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.835
I guess they've

19:26.540 --> 19:28.835
built their own catapult.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.003
That's impossible.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.211
How could they do that?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.047
Where would they

19:31.253 --> 19:33.047
get the materials?

19:33.089 --> 19:34.924
It's a funnel

19:33.089 --> 19:34.924
and surgical tubing.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.593
Stevie's garage

19:34.966 --> 19:37.593
is filled with that stuff.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.219
What are we

19:37.635 --> 19:39.219
going to do?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.220
We're going to fight.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.221
They're Krelboynes.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.389
They're nothing.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.308
We can fight. We can fight.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.019
We can fight.

19:46.060 --> 19:49.147
We can fight.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.857
We have to surrender.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.025
Francis is right.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.275
We have to

19:52.066 --> 19:53.275
give up, Reese.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.485
Come on,

19:53.317 --> 19:54.485
you wussies.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.236
Just shoot me

19:54.527 --> 19:56.236
over there.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.238
I'll kick their

19:56.278 --> 19:58.238
asses myself.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.657
Get it off!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.241
Oh, my God!

20:01.283 --> 20:02.242
Get it off!

20:02.284 --> 20:04.495
They're surrendering.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.874
And I suppose I've never been

20:04.537 --> 20:07.874
offered the chance to surrender.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.584
Keep firing!

20:12.336 --> 20:15.756
Well, they won't even

20:12.336 --> 20:15.756
let us surrender honorably.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.968
Boys, it's time

20:15.798 --> 20:18.968
to run away like cowards.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.683
(all groaning)

20:25.725 --> 20:27.768
Well, there is

20:25.725 --> 20:27.768
some comfort in knowing

20:27.810 --> 20:31.271
what the next two hours

20:27.810 --> 20:31.271
of my life are going to be like.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.899
Oh. Look.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.316
A shooting star.

20:40.698 --> 20:43.492
Well, I'm thinking

20:40.698 --> 20:43.492
much more clearly now.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.286
Yeah, I think

20:43.534 --> 20:46.286
we both are, Hal.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.206
I guess Mexico's

20:46.328 --> 20:48.206
not really an option.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.207
No, I don't think so.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.290
No. No.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.876
It would have been

20:50.332 --> 20:51.876
fun, though.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.961
Oh, yeah.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.547
So, what do we do now?

20:56.589 --> 21:01.177
Well, I assume the car has

20:56.589 --> 21:01.177
been reported stolen already,

21:01.219 --> 21:04.013
and we've probably

21:01.219 --> 21:04.013
left our share

21:04.055 --> 21:07.767
of DNA evidence in here.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.493
It's only a

21:24.450 --> 21:26.493
30-mile walk.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.996
We'll be home

21:26.535 --> 21:28.996
for breakfast.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.331
You know, I'm glad

21:29.038 --> 21:31.331
we didn't run away.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.333
Yeah, me, too.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.545
What was my name again?

21:36.587 --> 21:38.589
Raul, baby.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.589
Oh, yeah.
