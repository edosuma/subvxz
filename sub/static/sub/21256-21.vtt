WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.480
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.510 --> 00:02.920
Uh, we wanna welcome

00:02.960 --> 00:04.520
Eliza's brothers, Carter and Jamie.

00:04.540 --> 00:07.180
And I don't think that everyone
knows our foster son, Corey.

00:07.210 --> 00:08.880
Have you heard anything about my mom?

00:08.900 --> 00:10.700
She had an appointment
with the judge again.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.000
I hope she didn't show up.

00:12.020 --> 00:13.280
I want you to be my moms.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.799
Eliza thought they were
cool with you marrying us.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.566
But I guess it's just
important to her parents

00:17.590 --> 00:19.580
that we get married by
an actual minister.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.320
I need to talk to you about Emma.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.290
You got a job offer in India.

00:23.330 --> 00:25.800
- Jesus, I...
- Go to India. I'm done.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.260
We still haven't seen
your final grades yet.

00:28.300 --> 00:29.610
We both went to college in Boston,

00:29.630 --> 00:30.900
so we got back together.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.415
But then, he went on tour and came back

00:32.439 --> 00:33.740
and gave me crabs, so...

00:33.820 --> 00:36.036
Why do you assume that all
corporate lawyers are charlatans?

00:36.060 --> 00:38.860
Why do you assume you need to
mansplain what my job as a lawyer is?

00:38.960 --> 00:40.376
I think someone has a crush on you.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.630
He's not my type.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.646
Eliza's brother says
that he has a girlfriend,

00:43.670 --> 00:46.120
but do you kind of get,
like, a gay vibe from him?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.920
How many have you had?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.440
_

00:51.330 --> 00:54.270
- _
- JIM: It's a prenuptial agreement.

00:54.310 --> 00:56.660
I'd like you to read it and
sign it before the wedding.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.816
Your first love is getting
married this week.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.840
Is that weird at all?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.960
I guess, yeah. Maybe a little.

01:09.260 --> 01:10.460
Hey, you.

01:10.490 --> 01:12.450
- Don't forget your toiletries.
- Oh, yeah.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.060
Are you excited?

01:14.100 --> 01:15.460
- Yeah.
- Me too.

01:17.270 --> 01:19.200
Hey, Jude, will you, uh,
help him with his bag?

01:19.230 --> 01:20.260
Sure.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.100
I don't need help.

01:22.190 --> 01:23.390
Yeah, I know.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.420
All right, we're leaving
in 30 minutes, guys!

01:25.460 --> 01:27.560
Forgot my bridesmaid's dress.

01:27.590 --> 01:28.619
"Forgot?"

01:28.620 --> 01:30.399
I didn't know you were moving to Turks.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.200
Hey, I like options.

01:32.230 --> 01:34.600
Hey, can I, uh, talk to you?

01:40.440 --> 01:41.660
Jesus.

01:42.410 --> 01:44.370
Excuse me. Little help here.

01:44.410 --> 01:47.180
Why don't you ask your travel
buddy, Wyatt, for help?

01:47.210 --> 01:49.350
Oh, my God. I never...

01:49.380 --> 01:52.150
seriously asked him to
come with me to Europe.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.350
And even if we did go together,

01:54.390 --> 01:56.466
it would only delay your
business for a couple months.

01:56.490 --> 01:58.030
And it's not like you have any jobs yet.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.590
I'm tired of waiting for people

01:59.620 --> 02:02.230
who bail on me when they
get a better offer.

02:02.260 --> 02:04.360
Emma did not bail on you.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.700
She asked you to go with her.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.260
And what am I gonna do in India?

02:07.300 --> 02:09.580
Do yoga all day? Get enlightened?

02:10.139 --> 02:12.680
No. From now on, it's all
about me and what I want.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.170
Have you heard from your friend yet?

02:15.210 --> 02:17.340
Aaron's friend's friend. No.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.099
Okay, but you've read it
though, right? I mean, it's

02:19.100 --> 02:20.309
pretty straightforward.

02:20.310 --> 02:21.440
On the face.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.800
But there's language in there
that I'm not familiar with.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.280
You need a prenup expert.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.100
The real question is why you
have to sign anything at all.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.700
- Doesn't Eliza trust you?
- No, it's her dad.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.020
She didn't even know about
this until he sprung it on me.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.920
Why is he springing it on you days
before you're supposed to get married?

02:37.430 --> 02:40.430
Unless he doesn't want you
to have a lawyer look at it.

02:40.470 --> 02:43.330
I really... I can't handle
conspiracy theories right now.

02:43.370 --> 02:45.130
Um...

02:45.880 --> 02:47.540
I have to take this.

02:47.570 --> 02:48.600
Hey, what's up?

02:50.540 --> 02:53.280
Uh, I mean, yeah, I'd love to,

02:53.310 --> 02:55.510
but I'm, uh... I'm getting married.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.580
Could it wait a couple weeks?

03:00.020 --> 03:02.150
Hey, Scott.

03:02.190 --> 03:03.320
What's up?

03:03.460 --> 03:05.250
Can I have a word with your moms?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.500
So, finally she shows
up for a court date,

03:09.530 --> 03:12.040
and suddenly the judge thinks
that she's fit to be a parent?

03:12.080 --> 03:13.920
She completed the parenting classes

03:13.930 --> 03:15.840
and the 30-day rehab and for now,

03:15.880 --> 03:18.430
he's just granting her
unsupervised visits.

03:18.470 --> 03:21.570
Well, then, I mean, you know,
if she's been sober for 30 days

03:21.610 --> 03:23.980
after a decade of drug
abuse, by all means...

03:24.060 --> 03:26.760
So what else? I know you didn't
just come to tell us that.

03:27.550 --> 03:29.410
When Corey's mother heard that

03:29.450 --> 03:31.660
you were taking him out of
the country, she got scared

03:31.700 --> 03:33.450
that maybe you wouldn't bring him back.

03:33.490 --> 03:36.150
- That's ridiculous.
- I told her that, but

03:36.190 --> 03:37.970
the judge rescinded the permission

03:37.980 --> 03:39.100
to take Corey to the wedding.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
- What?
- I'm really sorry.

03:40.121 --> 03:41.160
- Bullshit!
- No way.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.200
We'll find a respite family to
put him in while you're gone.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.860
Oh, no, no, no. No. Absolutely not.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.460
He is not staying with strangers.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.300
- One of us is gonna stay home.
- I'll stay.

03:48.330 --> 03:51.570
No one should have to
miss your son's wedding.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.479
It's just for a few days.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.740
Corey will be fine.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.140
What's wrong?

04:00.580 --> 04:02.180
Is there a problem?

04:58.240 --> 05:00.100
- Welcome to Beaches, sir.
- Thank you.

05:05.110 --> 05:07.920
Listen, we're here at Beaches

05:07.940 --> 05:09.959
in Turks and Caicos. All right?

05:09.960 --> 05:12.150
I will, uh, get you the
number, uh, later.

05:12.180 --> 05:13.320
Look. Look at that sign.

05:13.350 --> 05:15.080
Eliza and Brandon.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.290
- It's crazy.
- Wow!

05:18.390 --> 05:20.320
Are the Fishers treating you well?

05:20.360 --> 05:22.960
Yes, they're nice. They have an Xbox.

05:23.130 --> 05:25.080
Whoa! You must be in heaven!

05:25.100 --> 05:26.860
- We wish you were here.
- Yeah.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.310
Maybe we'll bring you here
to celebrate your adoption?

05:29.420 --> 05:30.500
That would be awesome.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.500
We'll call later to say good night.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.270
Everybody say good night to Corey!

05:36.310 --> 05:38.370
- Bye, Corey.
- See you later.

05:38.580 --> 05:40.180
Miss you all.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.210
He seems okay, right?

05:45.250 --> 05:46.940
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:47.450 --> 05:48.680
What?

05:49.720 --> 05:51.370
I just think we need
to be a little careful

05:51.380 --> 05:53.430
about making promises we
might not be able to keep.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.330
Well, nobody is gonna
take him away from us.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.080
I'm feeling bad about
this destination wedding.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.100
Don't be silly.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.546
Gram can't come because of Grandpa.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.160
And Gramma can't fly because
of her knee surgery.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.450
And Dad's not coming until tomorrow.

06:06.470 --> 06:08.140
- Yeah, but we're all here.
- Yeah.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.070
- It's gonna be great.
- We're gonna have fun.

06:10.110 --> 06:11.270
- Relax.
- Yes, yes, yes.

06:11.310 --> 06:13.280
- Loosen up, we're on the island now.
- Okay.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.326
All right. Yeah, I know.

06:15.350 --> 06:17.350
Welcome, everyone.

06:17.380 --> 06:18.380
- Hi!
- Hi!

06:18.420 --> 06:20.520
- Hey!
- Hey, how are you?

06:20.960 --> 06:22.550
Hi!

06:22.590 --> 06:25.250
These are my friends
and other bridesmaids,

06:25.290 --> 06:27.120
Ashley and Jayden.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.220
Nice to meet you.

06:28.260 --> 06:31.290
And then, these are Brandon's moms,

06:31.330 --> 06:33.260
Stef and Lena.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.200
- Hi!
- Hi!

06:35.230 --> 06:37.400
His brothers, Jude and Jesus.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.170
Welcome to paradise.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.440
And these are Brandon's sisters,

06:41.470 --> 06:43.540
Mariana and Callie.

06:44.580 --> 06:47.180
- Hi.
- After the rehearsal dinner tonight,

06:47.210 --> 06:49.320
we're gonna do a little
impromptu bachelorette party.

06:49.460 --> 06:52.180
- Ooh, that sounds like fun.
- Great.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.800
Mmm, wait a second,

06:53.840 --> 06:55.480
if the girls are doing
a bachelorette party,

06:55.500 --> 06:57.800
that means we have got to
have a bachelor party.

06:57.840 --> 06:58.850
- No.
- Yes.

06:58.860 --> 07:00.040
- No. No.
- Yes.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.840
Fine. We're gonna make
it a surprise then.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.280
You just told me.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.330
So, once everyone's
settled into their rooms,

07:07.370 --> 07:09.440
my parents are having a
little welcome lunch

07:09.500 --> 07:11.470
in the Seaside Beach Cabana.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.070
Hmm. Welcome lunch.

07:14.110 --> 07:16.310
Wonder if they're going
to actually let us host

07:16.340 --> 07:17.500
the rehearsal dinner tonight?

07:17.780 --> 07:19.520
Of course they will.

07:20.310 --> 07:21.426
They wouldn't let us marry them.

07:21.450 --> 07:23.280
Obviously, they want us
to have nothing to do

07:23.310 --> 07:24.519
- with this wedding.
- Would you try to

07:24.520 --> 07:25.880
behave yourself, please.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.096
I don't know what you're talking
about. I always behave myself.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.500
- I'll be there.
- I think we're all gonna be there.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.560
So, this goes to my room.
It's under Brandon Foster.

07:33.590 --> 07:35.100
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.270
You brought your keyboard?

07:36.290 --> 07:37.880
Uh, yeah.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.360
Yeah, I got a call about,

07:39.400 --> 07:41.560
uh, scoring this short
film right before I left.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.500
So, you're gonna be working

07:43.530 --> 07:45.400
over our wedding and honeymoon?

07:45.440 --> 07:48.560
No. Just at night, you know.
Like, when you're asleep.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.760
Well, why can't you just
do it when we get back?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.060
Well, it's got to be ready

07:52.080 --> 07:53.956
in, like, two weeks for
the Venice Film Festival.

07:53.980 --> 07:56.210
Hey, look, I promise it won't take

07:56.250 --> 07:58.780
any attention away from
you or the wedding. Okay?

07:59.140 --> 08:01.350
- Okay.
- I love you.

08:01.390 --> 08:02.420
I love you, too.

08:02.450 --> 08:04.150
Oh. Hey, sir, actually, um...

08:04.190 --> 08:05.370
We've got to be delicate with this.

08:05.390 --> 08:06.536
I... I'll just take it myself.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.390
Totally fine. Thank you so much.

08:08.430 --> 08:09.460
Thank you.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.326
You don't think you should,
like, maybe warn them?

08:25.350 --> 08:27.520
- Warn them?
- They're going to be surprised.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.190
I sure hope so.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.159
- Welcome!
- Well, hello, there.

08:32.190 --> 08:33.490
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:33.530 --> 08:36.130
We were so sorry to hear
that Corey couldn't come.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.799
Oh, thank you, we were too.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.280
So, his mother wants him back?

08:41.039 --> 08:42.970
Well, she wants visitations.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.620
And, uh, how will that affect
your plans to adopt him?

08:45.640 --> 08:47.340
- Well, it won't.
- Uh, we don't know yet.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.940
- Well...
- Do your other adopted kids

08:49.980 --> 08:51.380
ever see their real parents?

08:51.410 --> 08:54.010
Well, we're their real parents.

08:54.050 --> 08:56.860
Oh, of course, I meant their
real mothers and fathers.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.090
Well, real mothers and
fathers are the people that

09:01.120 --> 09:02.500
raise them and care for them.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.160
They're referred to as birth parents.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.890
And, yes. They, uh...

09:05.930 --> 09:06.990
they've all met them,

09:07.030 --> 09:09.520
and they're in their lives
to varying degrees.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.960
Well, I guess Mariana
and Jesus probably have

09:12.000 --> 09:13.600
the most contact with their, uh...

09:13.660 --> 09:15.000
their birth mother.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.330
What's that like, having your
ex-husband married to Ana?

09:18.340 --> 09:20.920
I mean, it must be interesting.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.210
Well, like you said, we're
an interesting family.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.110
Right?

09:26.150 --> 09:27.959
Thank goodness. I'm
glad that we are having

09:27.960 --> 09:29.340
a small, intimate wedding.

09:29.380 --> 09:32.540
Can you imagine if you had to
explain us to all of your friends?

09:34.160 --> 09:35.990
Can you imagine?

09:37.990 --> 09:40.190
I am gonna go check out the spread.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.960
- Yes.
- Looks delicious. Excuse me.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.160
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.070
I'm actually hungry myself, so...

09:52.010 --> 09:53.170
Did you see that?

09:53.210 --> 09:54.340
Yeah.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.050
It's only been a couple
days, but I missed you.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.310
- I missed you, too.
- Mmm.

10:04.220 --> 10:07.120
Maybe, uh, we can sneak away

10:07.160 --> 10:09.020
before the rehearsal dinner?

10:09.060 --> 10:10.190
How about right now?

10:10.220 --> 10:12.320
- We can't now.
- Why not?

10:18.370 --> 10:19.370
Um...

10:20.370 --> 10:23.300
so I hate to bring this up right now,

10:23.340 --> 10:25.199
but my dad's been asking if

10:25.200 --> 10:26.969
you had a chance to sign the thing?

10:26.970 --> 10:30.310
Uh, no, not yet. But...

10:30.340 --> 10:32.950
I mean, look, I have no problem with it.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.350
I just, uh...

10:34.380 --> 10:36.120
I'm having Callie take a look...

10:36.150 --> 10:38.160
- You asked Callie?
- Yeah.

10:38.990 --> 10:40.116
I mean, she's a lawyer, you know.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.440
Great.

10:43.090 --> 10:45.190
- What?
- I'm sure she hates me now.

10:45.230 --> 10:47.090
Eliza, she doesn't hate you, okay.

10:47.130 --> 10:48.599
She wanted a friend
to take a look at it,

10:48.600 --> 10:50.600
someone who knows these
things, you know.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.146
She's just waiting to hear
back from him. That's it.

10:52.170 --> 10:53.840
I don't care about the prenup.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.970
I know we're never
getting divorced, so...

10:56.000 --> 10:57.200
I know, but your dad does,

10:57.240 --> 10:59.120
and I don't want to make
a big drama out of it.

11:00.340 --> 11:02.419
Look, if Callie doesn't hear back

11:02.420 --> 11:03.479
from her friend by the end of the day,

11:03.480 --> 11:05.010
I'll just sign it, and that'll be it.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.320
Okay?

11:07.280 --> 11:09.680
Hey, we're in this beautiful place,

11:09.720 --> 11:12.180
and I don't want you to stress out.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.340
I just want us to have
the perfect wedding.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.390
Okay?

11:17.960 --> 11:19.020
Yup.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.230
Wow, the water's so blue.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.930
Can't wait to go swimming.

11:24.970 --> 11:26.060
Yeah, totally.

11:31.210 --> 11:32.620
It is on.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.220
It is not on.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.540
Ugh!

11:43.860 --> 11:45.860
I think she stole your line.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.160
Oh no, not you. Ugh, my ex.

11:50.190 --> 11:52.060
Oh, the guy who, uh...

11:52.090 --> 11:54.160
You know what? I'm just
gonna go grab a drink.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.400
Yeah.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.780
So, did you hear from any of the judges

11:59.800 --> 12:00.940
you interviewed with?

12:01.070 --> 12:03.900
I did. I heard from Judge Wilson.

12:04.370 --> 12:05.420
And?

12:05.520 --> 12:08.120
And he offered me the clerkship.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.620
I'm so sorry to hear that.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.240
You must be devastated.

12:12.950 --> 12:15.140
I am holding out for Judge Engleman.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.380
I know I don't have to mansplain to you,

12:18.720 --> 12:21.240
but it's a big deal to get
a clerkship of any kind.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.960
Congratulations.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.090
Thank you.

12:39.170 --> 12:41.210
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.500
So, your brother...

12:45.110 --> 12:46.480
does he have a girlfriend?

12:48.560 --> 12:49.660
He's gay.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.050
Really?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.260
I mean, what's the story with Mat?

12:53.280 --> 12:54.900
Is he really in a rock band?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.380
That's the rumor.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.840
Isn't he your ex?

12:58.360 --> 13:01.300
Yeah, but, I mean, if you're
hot for him, go for it.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.620
But I should disclose
that he gave me crabs.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.500
You really want Moms
seeing you with that?

13:17.010 --> 13:18.400
Drinking age here is 18.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.540
Uh-huh.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.680
He is so gay.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.660
I heard he has a girlfriend.

13:30.820 --> 13:33.190
I've been with a lot of
guys who have girlfriends.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.920
Really? You've been with a lot of guys?

13:36.720 --> 13:38.360
Is that why you're taking PrEP?

13:40.170 --> 13:41.580
How do you know about that?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.659
When you were hammered
at the graduation party

13:46.660 --> 13:48.310
and I had to put you to bed,

13:48.340 --> 13:51.340
I picked up some of your
clothes, and the bottle fell out.

13:52.410 --> 13:54.980
Really? It fell out?

13:55.550 --> 13:57.280
Should I be worried?

13:57.320 --> 13:59.150
Are you having safe sex?

13:59.190 --> 14:01.090
If I was a girl,

14:01.120 --> 14:03.200
would you act the same way
if this was birth control?

14:04.230 --> 14:07.130
Would you suddenly assume
I was going to be unsafe?

14:07.160 --> 14:09.760
If you were a 19-year-old
girl on birth control,

14:09.770 --> 14:12.030
hooking up with a lot
of people, then yeah.

14:12.070 --> 14:13.540
I would be just as worried.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.100
It's not just HIV you
have to think about.

14:18.140 --> 14:19.720
There are STIs.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.270
Look, the CDC recommends PrEP

14:22.310 --> 14:24.800
for all sexually active gay men. Okay?

14:25.820 --> 14:27.540
I'm being responsible.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.180
And just because, you know,

14:29.220 --> 14:31.066
you haven't hooked up with
anyone in five years,

14:31.090 --> 14:32.696
doesn't mean you have to be
uptight about the rest of us.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.100
How would you know anything
about my sex life?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.460
You know what? You're right.

14:37.490 --> 14:39.820
I guess I wouldn't seeing
that we barely talk.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.540
I'm gonna grab something to eat.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.520
Hey. So, uh, have you heard back yet?

14:59.580 --> 15:00.580
Not yet.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.620
Okay. Well, Eliza's getting
pressure from her dad, so...

15:03.680 --> 15:05.990
Why doesn't she just
stand up to him then?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.770
If the prenup wasn't her idea?

15:07.780 --> 15:09.820
Because I don't want her
to. So, can you just...

15:09.840 --> 15:12.000
Yeah. I'll text Aaron right now.

15:12.130 --> 15:13.280
Thank you.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.860
I was thinking of trying one of those.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.310
Yeah? You, uh, ride them on the sand?

15:25.350 --> 15:27.150
I think in the water.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.080
Wanna find out?

15:59.180 --> 16:01.310
Uh, you're blocking my sun.

16:01.350 --> 16:03.200
You told Jayden that I was gay?

16:03.860 --> 16:06.380
Oh. I thought she was
talking about Jude.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.360
- I'm sure.
- Hey!

16:09.820 --> 16:11.540
who wants to go in the water?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.130
Uh...

16:15.160 --> 16:16.500
Uh, me!

16:43.420 --> 16:46.300
Then the cops show up at
my place a few days later.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.860
A.J. makes it out the back.

16:51.130 --> 16:52.360
With me.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.530
What are you doing?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.359
Hey.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.360
I, uh, I'm just...

17:00.370 --> 17:01.740
watching the short.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.040
Sorry.

17:06.180 --> 17:07.858
Look, I know the timing is bad,

17:07.859 --> 17:09.720
but it's getting a lot of buzz.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.020
There will be other shorts with buzz,

17:12.050 --> 17:13.329
but we're only getting married once.

17:13.349 --> 17:15.390
It's not like you're getting paid.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.760
I just want you to be present.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.300
I know.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.260
I am.

17:25.329 --> 17:26.400
Okay.

17:36.210 --> 17:37.460
Hey.

17:37.780 --> 17:40.660
Hey. Where's your neck accessory?

17:42.550 --> 17:44.180
Ashley?

17:46.020 --> 17:47.970
So, are we still doing
this thing tonight?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.220
Well, we're broken up.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.360
Don't you think it's gonna
be a little awkward?

17:53.390 --> 17:56.090
Not as awkward as you telling
those girls I gave you crabs.

17:56.130 --> 17:58.160
- Well, you did.
- Well, I didn't.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.280
I wasn't the one who slept with
someone when we were together.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.270
- We were broken up.
- We were in a fight.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.820
A fight in which you broke up with me.

18:04.220 --> 18:06.420
Okay, I'm not having
this conversation again.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.210
- Fine. Forget it.
- But...

18:12.380 --> 18:14.310
I will do our thing tonight.

18:14.350 --> 18:15.660
For Brandon.

18:16.450 --> 18:18.020
For Brandon.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.220
Meet me in an hour.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.430
So, I want to know who
invented the water tricycle.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.800
Yeah, and why they thought
it was a good idea.

18:32.170 --> 18:34.330
- So, what village are you in?
- Caribbean.

18:34.370 --> 18:37.100
I'm in Seaside. 205.

18:37.140 --> 18:38.420
205, huh?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.700
That wasn't trying to
tell you my room number.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.310
- Really?
- I... I swear.

18:42.340 --> 18:45.340
Look. I know it's like a thing

18:45.380 --> 18:47.340
to get laid at weddings, but

18:47.440 --> 18:49.460
if that's what you're working at here,

18:49.500 --> 18:51.120
it's just not gonna happen.

18:51.150 --> 18:53.100
Why are you so sure that's
what I want to happen?

18:53.350 --> 18:55.980
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to bruise your ego.

18:56.490 --> 18:58.460
What are you trying to do?

18:58.490 --> 19:01.090
You know, besides do everything
in your power to make me feel

19:01.130 --> 19:03.050
like a masochist for wanting
to get to know you?

19:04.900 --> 19:06.879
It's just been a while since I've been

19:06.880 --> 19:08.420
interested in anybody.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.520
Okay. So you forgot how?

19:11.270 --> 19:14.340
Or you're just not that
into me? Which is cool.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.200
I wouldn't mind being friends.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.420
Yeah. I wouldn't mind that either.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.080
Great. So...

19:21.120 --> 19:23.150
maybe you could be nice to me now?

19:23.180 --> 19:24.480
I'll try.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.920
Okay.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.620
I'll see you tonight.

19:35.330 --> 19:38.300
This was taken during Brandon's
Twilight vampire phase.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.220
And this was a bad hair phase.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.460
This is his current very happy phase.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.770
Eliza, you came into our son's life

19:51.780 --> 19:53.360
after a rather dark period,

19:53.400 --> 19:56.470
and you have lit him up like
we've never seen before.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.270
As you can see, Brandon
and Eliza had something

19:58.280 --> 19:59.960
in common right from the very start...

19:59.980 --> 20:01.540
red hair.

20:01.570 --> 20:02.570
And it didn't stop there.

20:02.571 --> 20:04.339
They both enjoyed playing dress-up.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.580
So, Jude is the gay son?

20:08.640 --> 20:10.250
Yeah, I think so.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.150
Music of course.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.980
And they both enjoyed
sticking out their tongues.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.320
Yeah.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.060
- _
- LENA: And boating.

20:20.070 --> 20:21.650
_

20:21.660 --> 20:24.560
- Yes, boating.
- Look at these.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.100
And posing with strange statues.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.440
Very strange.

20:28.940 --> 20:30.550
Uh, I think it's pretty clear

20:30.570 --> 20:31.780
that it was meant to be.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.240
Eliza, thank you for loving our son,

20:36.100 --> 20:38.280
and we wanna welcome you to our family.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.280
We love you.

20:45.250 --> 20:49.140
Well, we certainly can't compete
with that lovely slideshow.

20:49.220 --> 20:50.220
Hmm.

20:50.230 --> 20:52.900
Stef and Lena, thank you so very much.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.230
Yes, thank you.

20:54.260 --> 20:56.859
So we, uh... we'll keep this brief,

20:56.860 --> 20:59.530
which means I'll do the talking.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.940
Uh...

21:03.400 --> 21:04.600
Brandon...

21:04.640 --> 21:05.820
you're a fine young man.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.740
Our beloved and only daughter

21:08.780 --> 21:10.410
made a good choice.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.210
However, if you ever
hurt her, I'll kill ya.

21:13.580 --> 21:16.180
Now, that said, uh, we would like

21:16.210 --> 21:18.500
to present our wedding
gift to you tonight.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.420
Heads up.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.520
- What are these?
- Those are keys

21:24.560 --> 21:26.520
to your very own condo in Santa Monica.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.739
Three bedrooms, two baths, and

21:28.740 --> 21:30.500
just blocks from the beach.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.020
All you have to cover are the HOA fees,

21:33.060 --> 21:34.630
property taxes, and insurance.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.230
Oh, and of course we'll
help you furnish it.

21:37.270 --> 21:39.640
We just wanted you two to
choose all that yourselves.

21:41.140 --> 21:43.079
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.640
Thank you.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.380
Okay, if you don't marry
the brother, I will.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.820
Wow.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.390
Oh, also, we arranged

21:59.420 --> 22:01.320
for a little entertainment.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.980
I... I hope that's okay?

22:46.510 --> 22:47.580
Hey.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.620
Brandon told me that you're
looking over the prenup,

22:52.480 --> 22:55.350
and I just wanted to let you
know it wasn't my idea.

22:56.180 --> 22:58.420
It's really not a big deal, at all.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.560
- Well, maybe not to you. But...
- What?

23:05.620 --> 23:07.099
I just...

23:07.100 --> 23:09.199
I wonder if you've thought about

23:09.200 --> 23:10.920
how it makes Brandon feel?

23:11.000 --> 23:14.360
Your parents obviously don't trust him,

23:14.400 --> 23:16.470
and you're not really
doing anything about it.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.470
No, I'm happy to tell them
that... he's not gonna sign it,

23:19.500 --> 23:22.240
but, you know, he doesn't want me to.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.310
I'm just trying to protect my brother.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.350
Your brother.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.279
So how do you think they eat the

23:33.280 --> 23:35.040
fire without burning their throats?

23:35.250 --> 23:36.700
Hmm?

23:38.590 --> 23:39.780
Here you go.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.999
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.190
Oh, so, we're drinking now?

23:45.160 --> 23:46.900
- I'm only having one beer...
- Mm-hmm.

23:46.940 --> 23:48.740
... and the drinking age is 18 here.

23:49.570 --> 23:50.840
You all right, sweetheart?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.800
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.180
Why?

23:55.760 --> 23:58.440
Hey, I just wanted to
say thank you so much

23:58.480 --> 24:01.280
for this incredible party
and the slideshow.

24:01.310 --> 24:02.720
It was really sweet.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.280
You both must have worked
really hard on that.

24:06.550 --> 24:08.280
It can't compare to a condo.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.590
You're welcome, sweetheart.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.100
Look, just make sure that you are clear

24:13.120 --> 24:15.330
on any strings attached. Okay?

24:15.340 --> 24:16.970
Yes. Do you remember when my parents

24:16.980 --> 24:18.740
gave us the down payment for our house.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.180
And later on, there was
a misunderstanding

24:21.190 --> 24:22.990
about whether it was a gift or a loan.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.040
Just be careful.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.140
Hey, can we have your attention please?

24:30.020 --> 24:32.239
Brandon, Eliza asked us

24:32.240 --> 24:34.180
to sing something that you wrote,

24:34.250 --> 24:35.959
which took a lot of thinking

24:35.960 --> 24:37.530
since we didn't want to embarrass you.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.620
I'm just... I'm just kidding.

24:40.650 --> 24:43.490
What were you and my
sister talking about?

24:43.520 --> 24:44.840
The prenup?

24:46.520 --> 24:47.960
You know about that?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.640
Tell him not to sign it.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.780
- Have you read it?
- No.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.100
But I know my dad,

24:54.140 --> 24:56.620
and I'm sure it's not
entirely fair to Brandon.

24:56.820 --> 24:59.400
So, we're gonna sing
a song that he wrote.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.780
Thanks.

25:00.980 --> 25:04.380
Brandon, you're not only my best friend,

25:04.620 --> 25:06.980
you're the most talented
composer I know.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.720

27:16.250 --> 27:18.350
- Jayden.
- Yes.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.480
Anyways, technically,

27:23.520 --> 27:25.320
I did break up with him over the phone.

27:25.350 --> 27:27.460
And he immediately slept
with someone else.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.600
Yeah, but what if we're meant to be?

27:29.630 --> 27:30.859
It's a wedding.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.440
Everyone gets nostalgic at weddings.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.360
Just try not to do something
you'll regret later.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.899
"If you don't have each other's backs,

27:41.900 --> 27:43.440
who will?"

27:44.570 --> 27:45.920
Callie.

27:47.640 --> 27:48.700
No.

27:49.310 --> 27:50.320
Mine.

27:51.610 --> 27:53.280
Oh.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.880
What's going on with you and Eliza?

27:57.920 --> 27:58.920
Nothing.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.190
I got you now.

28:06.430 --> 28:08.200
- Oh!
- Whoo-hoo.

28:13.540 --> 28:15.500
Every girl in here is underage.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.080
I thought you had a girlfriend?

28:20.410 --> 28:23.110
We're not, like, exclusive.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.250
Do you have a boyfriend?

28:31.290 --> 28:32.350
No.

28:33.580 --> 28:35.950
Although, I did, all
throughout high school.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.000
His name was Noah.

28:38.190 --> 28:39.900
He went to Syracuse

28:39.980 --> 28:41.530
and has a new boyfriend.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.300
But, uh, we're still friends.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.819
Oh!

28:46.820 --> 28:48.259
That's what I'm talking about.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.839
- Come on, who's next?
- Brandon, my brother,

28:49.840 --> 28:50.840
you wanna play?

28:50.920 --> 28:52.840
Make it interesting. Five bucks a point?

28:52.940 --> 28:54.479
No, no, no, no. We're
not playing for money,

28:54.480 --> 28:55.519
I don't have any to lose.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.860
Oh, come on, you have a
condo and a sugar mama.

28:57.940 --> 28:59.380
My wife is not supporting me.

28:59.540 --> 29:01.199
If you don't make it as a film composer,

29:01.200 --> 29:02.560
you can always go work for my dad.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.280
Hey, Carter.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.700
Okay, Eliza understands I'm not
gonna make it big overnight.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.840
She's accustomed to a certain lifestyle.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.220
He's just busting your balls.

29:11.260 --> 29:13.290
You know, she always
gets what she wants.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.700
Oh!

29:18.980 --> 29:20.420
I think we need some beers.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.530
Yes.

29:21.570 --> 29:24.240
I think it's time we blow
this popsicle stand.

29:25.510 --> 29:27.110
Come on. Let's go.

29:27.820 --> 29:30.380
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

29:30.410 --> 29:31.410
Hey.

29:32.580 --> 29:35.100
So I heard back from my friend

29:35.280 --> 29:37.420
about the prenup.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.960
He doesn't think it's fair to Brandon.

29:41.860 --> 29:43.590
He says he shouldn't sign it.

29:45.140 --> 29:48.300
I think maybe, uh, you
should tell him yourself.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.170
You sure you don't want to tell him?

29:53.370 --> 29:54.560
Why?

29:55.820 --> 29:58.340
'Cause I know he was your first love.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.820
Is that why you don't
want him to marry me?

30:03.510 --> 30:05.560
'Cause you still have feelings for him.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.350
Hey, hey, hey! We are
crashing your party!

30:09.380 --> 30:11.000
Whoo! Oh, thank God.

30:11.020 --> 30:12.550
We were dying of boredom!

30:12.590 --> 30:13.979
Let's all dance.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.390
Really? Tell me more.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.400
How's it going?

30:26.180 --> 30:27.470
Good.

30:31.020 --> 30:33.800
State Assembly, that's ambitious.

30:33.980 --> 30:35.680
I haven't decided if I'm gonna run.

30:35.740 --> 30:36.939
They asked her because she's done such

30:36.940 --> 30:38.309
a good job on the school board.

30:38.310 --> 30:40.610
But the seat isn't even in our district.

30:40.650 --> 30:42.960
We'd have to sell our house and move.

30:42.980 --> 30:44.520
Well, it's a big deal.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.420
Of course, with the
kids out of the house,

30:46.460 --> 30:48.016
you really don't need
all those bedrooms.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.390
Oh, it's still nice for
them to come home to.

30:50.430 --> 30:51.800
Plus, we still have Corey, so...

30:51.840 --> 30:53.080
Hmm.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.000
I assume you'll be running
for a Democratic seat?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.180
Yes.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.230
We hope that we can
count on your support?

31:18.390 --> 31:20.880
So, what would it take to
get you on the dance floor?

31:20.940 --> 31:22.360
A lot more alcohol.

31:22.390 --> 31:23.880
Can I buy you a drink?

31:23.920 --> 31:25.980
It's all inclusive. But yes.

31:26.230 --> 31:28.260
Vodka cranberry.

31:30.160 --> 31:33.200
Hey, did you tell moms
I was taking PrEP?

31:33.240 --> 31:35.170
- No.
- Are you sure about that?

31:35.580 --> 31:37.800
Yeah, I'm sure about that. Why?

31:39.540 --> 31:41.540
Because they asked if I was all right.

31:41.580 --> 31:43.380
Because it's obvious that you're not.

31:44.450 --> 31:46.859
Jude, I'm sorry that I haven't

31:46.860 --> 31:48.249
been in your life that much,

31:48.250 --> 31:50.820
but this last year of law
school was really grueling.

31:50.980 --> 31:53.420
And we text, like, almost every day.

31:53.460 --> 31:55.900
Look, don't worry about it.

31:55.940 --> 31:58.360
All right? Forget what
I said. It's fine.

32:01.530 --> 32:03.130
Hey.

32:13.060 --> 32:16.420
Look, I don't want you
to sign the prenup.

32:17.550 --> 32:18.560
Why?

32:18.640 --> 32:20.920
Callie's friend said
it's not fair to you.

32:21.420 --> 32:23.220
Why would she tell you that?

32:23.250 --> 32:25.500
I just hate this whole thing.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.920
- I'll just go tell my dad...
- No, no, no.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.420
Don't tell your dad

32:29.460 --> 32:31.240
because he's just gonna
think I put you up to it

32:31.260 --> 32:33.390
and that I'm after your
money or something.

32:33.430 --> 32:35.119
He won't think that.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.360
And what's the deal with
this condo... by the way?

32:37.400 --> 32:39.170
What... What are these HOA fees,

32:39.200 --> 32:40.840
and what other strings
are attached here?

32:40.900 --> 32:42.856
I don't think there are any
other strings attached.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.346
Uh, no. When it comes to your parents,

32:44.370 --> 32:46.260
there are always strings attached.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.000
And not everyone graduates from college

32:49.040 --> 32:51.020
and immediately gets a
job with the LA Phil.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.180
Just so you know.

32:52.210 --> 32:53.640
Of course I do.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.960
Do you?

32:55.060 --> 32:56.480
Do your parents?

32:56.520 --> 32:57.960
It doesn't matter what they think.

32:58.020 --> 32:59.390
No, I think it does matter.

32:59.420 --> 33:01.570
Sometimes I think it's the only
thing that matters to you.

33:01.590 --> 33:04.390
That... That's why my
moms aren't marrying us

33:04.430 --> 33:06.590
and we have this destination wedding

33:06.630 --> 33:09.360
that only half my family can show up to.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.059
We've both been drinking.
Let's not have a stupid

33:11.060 --> 33:12.100
fight over nothing.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.800
Nothing? This is... This is nothing?

33:14.900 --> 33:17.400
Why don't you go back to your
room and work on your short?

33:17.600 --> 33:20.100
So you can accuse me
of not being present?

33:20.610 --> 33:22.240
- Okay.
- That's...

33:23.550 --> 33:25.140
Fine.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.350
Whoo!

33:44.500 --> 33:46.570
- What are you doing?
- Dancing.

33:46.600 --> 33:47.819
Between Jayden and me.

33:47.820 --> 33:49.299
You're making a fool out of yourself.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.860
I'm just trying to stop you from
doing something you'll regret.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.340
I'm single. I can do whatever I want.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.280
You still love Emma, and Emma loves you.

33:57.310 --> 33:58.390
And you always get back together.

33:58.410 --> 34:01.620
Once. We broke up and got
back together one time.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.000
And it's different this
time. Thanks to you.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.450
Thanks to me? What did I do?

34:05.490 --> 34:08.420
You just had to tell me about
her job offer in India.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.360
What? So you would just
rather her pass up

34:10.389 --> 34:12.406
this amazing opportunity and
you never know about it?

34:12.429 --> 34:14.429
Yes. Absolutely.

34:14.460 --> 34:16.360
Because then we'd still be together.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.679
But as usual, you just
can't shut your mouth

34:18.739 --> 34:20.600
about things that aren't your business.

34:20.719 --> 34:22.659
And when you finally decide
which of your multiple

34:22.659 --> 34:24.540
job offers you wanna take, please,

34:24.620 --> 34:27.370
pick the one as far away
from me as possible.

34:46.230 --> 34:48.530
You're gorgeous.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.500
We should hang out.

34:50.530 --> 34:52.570
We should do something
tonight. I don't know.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.580
What do you wanna do? I'll
do whatever you wanna do.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.470
I don't care.

35:04.410 --> 35:05.580
Hey, bud.

35:06.580 --> 35:08.920
- I think you need to call it.
- I'm fine.

35:09.060 --> 35:11.220
No. No, you're not. All right?

35:11.250 --> 35:12.350
Let's go.

35:13.390 --> 35:15.420
Come on. Come on.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.260
So I'd ask you back to
my room for a drink,

35:21.300 --> 35:23.160
but I wouldn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

35:23.980 --> 35:26.300
Or maybe you're just not interested

35:26.330 --> 35:28.200
now that I'm being nice to you.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
I wouldn't say that.

35:37.380 --> 35:39.250
I should... probably...

35:40.140 --> 35:41.740
Yeah, me too.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.780
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:05.860 --> 36:09.180
So, Eliza knows about us.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.210
Our history, I mean.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.250
- Did you tell her?
- No.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.220
How... How did she find out?

36:18.520 --> 36:19.520
I don't know.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.160
Maybe Mariana?

36:24.200 --> 36:25.390
Shit.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.470
Why did you tell her that I
shouldn't sign the prenup?

36:30.500 --> 36:32.170
Why didn't you just tell me?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.580
I thought it would be
better coming from her.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.840
She thinks I don't
want you to marry her.

36:48.580 --> 36:50.620
Maybe I don't want to.

36:50.650 --> 36:52.220
Marry her.

36:54.860 --> 36:56.100
I'm just...

36:56.860 --> 36:58.960
suddenly questioning if she...

37:00.920 --> 37:02.780
really is the one.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.440
Why are you having doubts?

37:20.140 --> 37:21.880
Because of the prenup?

37:22.580 --> 37:25.280
I mean, it's everything, you know?

37:25.310 --> 37:27.120
I'm just... I'm suddenly...

37:27.740 --> 37:31.120
questioning if she even
really gets me, you know?

37:32.590 --> 37:34.320
Maybe nobody does.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.800
I get you.

37:42.300 --> 37:44.740
You're the only person who's...

37:44.860 --> 37:47.740
ever really taken care of me.

37:50.570 --> 37:53.400
Like, when you found me at Coachella.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.410
How you knew I'd be there.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.940
If you hadn't come and brought me home,

37:59.960 --> 38:02.080
I don't know what I would have done.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.360
I think you're the person I...

38:08.320 --> 38:10.290
trust most in the world.

38:13.290 --> 38:15.130
Ditto.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.240
It's late.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.440
Yeah.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.090
Hey. You okay?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.160
I thought you'd be back in
your room with Ashley by now.

38:49.430 --> 38:52.430
Ashley's not the person I
want to take back to my room.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.510
Going down. Easy.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.250
All right, just...

39:12.320 --> 39:14.560
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.470
- Come on. I want...
- No, no, no, no.

39:16.490 --> 39:18.160
You're drunk. All right?

39:18.190 --> 39:22.530
You need to sleep this off.

39:29.170 --> 39:30.370
I'm so messed up.

39:34.860 --> 39:36.270
I know.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.640
It's okay.

39:39.860 --> 39:41.380
You're okay.

39:44.380 --> 39:47.390
Will you stay until I fall asleep?

39:49.320 --> 39:50.390
Sure.

39:52.530 --> 39:55.390
Okay. Let's get in bed.

39:55.430 --> 39:56.780
There you go.
