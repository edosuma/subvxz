Zinberg: <i>...and will be performed by Dr.
Schoenweiss and Klein</i>

01:25.118 --> 01:28.619
<i>with Dr. Haas assisting.</i>

01:28.754 --> 01:30.754
I'll be in surgery B with Dr. Jacobi

01:30.923 --> 01:34.092
performing a thyroidectomy
on the Itskowitz boy.

01:34.126 --> 01:35.693
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

01:35.895 --> 01:39.930
Regardless of your participation
in these surgeries,

01:40.065 --> 01:42.833
I want all of you to review the cases

01:42.902 --> 01:44.869
and familiarize yourselves

01:44.969 --> 01:48.005
with every aspect of the procedures.

01:48.139 --> 01:52.842
Now, I want to welcome
a new member of our team

01:52.944 --> 01:55.578
at the rank of third surgeon

01:55.746 --> 01:58.382
who has joined us
from the Knickerbocker,

01:58.449 --> 02:02.318
Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.

02:02.419 --> 02:04.953
You can all call me Bertie.

02:05.022 --> 02:07.089
Zinberg: Only in your off-hours.

02:07.257 --> 02:10.526
In the hospital you
will be Dr. Chickering.

02:12.162 --> 02:15.331
At Mount Sinai, we're a bit
more formal than the Knick.

02:15.332 --> 02:17.533
Certainly.

02:17.534 --> 02:20.101
Anything else?

02:20.136 --> 02:22.470
I am not a Jew.

02:22.471 --> 02:25.040
(laughter)

02:25.174 --> 02:27.275
But I worked on many
of them at the Knick.

02:27.476 --> 02:30.645
Recent immigrants mostly,
so I learned a little Yiddish.

02:30.646 --> 02:32.513
<i>Azoy?</i>

02:32.514 --> 02:34.749
<i>A bissel.</i>

02:34.783 --> 02:36.716
It will be helpful.

02:36.885 --> 02:40.620
Another one of Dr. Chickering's
gifts is for lab work.

02:40.788 --> 02:44.258
So in order to give him a
chance to get settled in,

02:44.359 --> 02:46.560
he'll join Guggenheim in the lab

02:46.794 --> 02:50.064
to search for surgical applications
for the new gland extract.

02:51.799 --> 02:54.500
I... I wasn't aware of
any new gland extract.

02:54.568 --> 02:57.203
It's an interesting substance

02:57.371 --> 02:59.672
that's been taken from the
glands of several animals

02:59.706 --> 03:02.075
by a Pole named Cybulski.

03:02.176 --> 03:04.310
I have no idea what he calls it,

03:04.378 --> 03:07.646
but we're calling it adrenaline.

03:07.814 --> 03:10.382
You'll help us learn if it
has any practical uses.

03:12.051 --> 03:15.187
So, unless there are
any other questions,

03:15.321 --> 03:17.689
I'll see some of you on grand rounds

03:17.823 --> 03:20.625
and the rest of you at second meeting.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.466
There's a second one of these meetings?

03:28.533 --> 03:30.734
At noon. And a third at 6:00.

03:30.735 --> 03:32.636
So be prepared.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.940
(chuckles)

03:37.075 --> 03:39.276
The first day of school
is always the hardest.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.247
Do I look that lost?

03:44.415 --> 03:48.050
No, it was more the
disappointed look on your face

03:48.252 --> 03:50.652
when you were told you'd be
working in the lab to start.

03:52.256 --> 03:54.724
Did Dr. Zinberg notice?

03:54.792 --> 03:56.792
Well, you concealed it well.

04:00.197 --> 04:02.431
He's letting me know
that I'm going to have

04:02.565 --> 04:04.366
to earn my way into the operating room

04:04.600 --> 04:08.470
and letting them know that he's
going to ease me into the fold.

04:08.571 --> 04:11.173
There's thought in everything he does.

04:11.241 --> 04:14.409
He's a very deliberate man.

04:14.610 --> 04:17.012
Is that why he has you taking
notes of his meetings?

04:18.447 --> 04:21.149
Why, because I couldn't
possibly be a surgeon like you?

04:22.918 --> 04:26.521
No, I just meant... no, I'm sorry, I...

04:26.555 --> 04:27.522
you're a surgeon.

04:27.556 --> 04:29.557
I... I hadn't...

04:29.591 --> 04:32.460
Look at you. (laughs)

04:32.494 --> 04:34.728
No, I'm not a surgeon.

04:34.763 --> 04:36.663
I'm not even a nurse.

04:36.664 --> 04:39.232
I'm...

04:39.434 --> 04:42.702
I'm writing a story about Dr.
Zinberg for "Collier's."

04:42.770 --> 04:44.804
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

04:44.905 --> 04:46.540
You write for "Collier's"?

04:46.740 --> 04:49.309
Yes, is that more surprising
than being a surgeon?

04:49.510 --> 04:52.611
Are you the girl who went
undercover for that article

04:52.745 --> 04:55.747
about sanitariums and lunatic asylums?

04:55.782 --> 04:57.949
Genevieve Everidge?

04:58.018 --> 05:00.118
Why, do you want to meet her?

05:00.153 --> 05:02.221
Well, I just imagine

05:02.356 --> 05:05.191
that she's a very exciting
person to talk to.

05:07.594 --> 05:10.295
Oh, she is.

05:12.365 --> 05:14.899
Yeah, especially when you take her out.

05:15.001 --> 05:19.337
So let's say Friday evening around 7:00.

05:27.612 --> 05:29.546
<i>- Mazel.
- Empty?</i>

05:29.814 --> 05:32.048
Cornelia: <i>Even Cleary was speechless
when he opened the coffin.</i>

05:32.183 --> 05:33.783
You're certain it was the correct grave?

05:33.784 --> 05:35.184
<i>I can read a headstone, Algie.</i>

05:35.186 --> 05:38.288
Sorry, it's just so odd.

05:38.523 --> 05:41.091
<i>It's like someone knew there'd
be people looking for Speight</i>

05:41.292 --> 05:43.359
<i>and wanted to make certain
he couldn't be found.</i>

05:43.360 --> 05:47.496
Yes, well, obviously they wanted you
to leave this alone and so do I.

05:47.664 --> 05:50.700
Speight didn't just
drunkenly fall overboard.

05:50.867 --> 05:53.702
There is more here and I
can't give up on it now.

05:53.703 --> 05:55.271
Yes, you can.

05:55.472 --> 05:57.658
If someone wanted him dead
or wanted the cause hidden,

05:57.659 --> 06:00.808
it's a matter for the police,
Cornelia, not for you.

06:00.843 --> 06:02.910
You're being reckless.

06:05.648 --> 06:07.249
Again.

06:28.336 --> 06:30.371
Not here.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.440
Not now.

06:35.443 --> 06:36.942
When?

06:53.126 --> 06:55.059
Thank you.

06:55.128 --> 06:56.488
Give us one more smile, love.

06:58.565 --> 07:00.465
You are yourself again.

07:02.902 --> 07:04.936
Are you tired?

07:05.037 --> 07:06.705
It has been an eventful morning.

07:06.872 --> 07:10.408
Perhaps I should lay down,
gather my strength.

07:10.542 --> 07:12.110
I can help Dorothy make lunch later.

07:12.111 --> 07:13.577
Dorothy: <i>Of course.</i>

07:42.305 --> 07:45.441
She does seem better, doesn't she?

07:46.743 --> 07:49.110
I'm praying for her.

07:49.179 --> 07:51.146
Our family certainly doesn't want

07:51.281 --> 07:53.682
to have to have her locked away for good.

07:57.754 --> 07:59.987
But what she is now is not acceptable.

08:01.657 --> 08:04.125
To whom?

08:04.126 --> 08:05.693
To us.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.763
To anyone.

08:08.930 --> 08:13.000
Everett, she's a baby
killer and a madwoman.

08:13.135 --> 08:16.237
Facts known not just
in New York anymore.

08:16.271 --> 08:18.071
(clears throat)

08:19.507 --> 08:22.576
They're talking in Philadelphia?

08:22.710 --> 08:25.579
Ethel's fiancé broke
off their engagement.

08:25.780 --> 08:29.683
And I'm living in hope like
some pathetic spinster.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.418
<i>She will get better.</i>

08:31.452 --> 08:33.753
We're all hoping.

08:33.886 --> 08:36.355
But I know Eleanor
wouldn't want her collapse

08:36.490 --> 08:39.491
to affect Ethel and me the way it has.

08:44.631 --> 08:46.599
(sloshing)

08:49.803 --> 08:52.236
We meet again.

08:52.238 --> 08:54.606
Mr. Robertson.

08:56.242 --> 08:59.411
I, um... I saw you in here
with these sick men.

08:59.545 --> 09:02.814
You're very good.
You brighten their day.

09:02.848 --> 09:05.216
Well, how could you not?

09:07.052 --> 09:10.554
Were you referring to
the comatose patient?

09:10.689 --> 09:14.057
The men who were delirious on morphine?

09:14.158 --> 09:16.159
Or the ones who were asleep?

09:16.261 --> 09:19.296
(chuckles) Then you brighten mine.

09:21.666 --> 09:23.300
Don't you believe me?

09:23.368 --> 09:25.034
I'm holding a full bedpan,

09:25.168 --> 09:28.237
so it's harder to believe
than you realize.

09:28.439 --> 09:31.841
Look, you're a quick and
clever girl and I like that,

09:32.075 --> 09:35.277
but when will you stop being
clever and give me a chance?

09:35.446 --> 09:37.880
There's no shortage of not
so clever nurses around here

09:37.881 --> 09:40.883
all hired by you

09:40.951 --> 09:42.917
who've already given you a chance

09:42.918 --> 09:44.653
and then some.

09:44.754 --> 09:47.689
But you're the one that has me intrigued.

09:47.790 --> 09:49.724
Do you already have men courting you?

09:51.461 --> 09:54.028
You hesitated. I'm gonna
take that as a no,

09:54.196 --> 09:57.332
which tells me I shouldn't
give up the chase.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.801
Then tell me, Mr. Robertson...

10:02.203 --> 10:03.604
do you believe in God?

10:05.774 --> 10:07.708
Do you read the Bible,

10:07.709 --> 10:09.543
go to church

10:09.611 --> 10:11.846
and lead a Christian life?

10:13.982 --> 10:16.082
You're hesitating.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.317
So I'm gonna take that as a no.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.655
Which tells me you should most
definitely give up the chase.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.232
Clara! Clara!

10:34.401 --> 10:36.000
Thackery on phone: <i>What happened to her?</i>

10:36.001 --> 10:37.990
She broke into Hackett's
office and gave herself

10:37.991 --> 10:40.238
a heroin injection big
enough to kill an elephant.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.007
Fucking putrid scene.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.642
<i>Where's the body now?</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:46.134
Family is sending someone up
from the city to collect it.

10:46.135 --> 10:48.178
Turns out, her real name
is Marianne Horner.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.347
Family's got some big
copper mining company.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.849
Absolutely not.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.118
I can understand your trepidation.

10:54.119 --> 10:55.786
Trepidation?

10:55.921 --> 10:58.288
You want to cut our dead daughter open

10:58.457 --> 11:02.426
and root around inside her
like some jewelry box.

11:02.628 --> 11:05.997
It's enough that we've had to
live with her cocaine addiction.

11:06.097 --> 11:09.098
<i>She allowed men into her mouth</i>

11:09.166 --> 11:10.967
<i>in exchange for the drug.</i>

11:13.304 --> 11:16.272
Our friends believe that she's
been away in Virginia at college

11:16.341 --> 11:18.307
and came down with the flu.

11:18.509 --> 11:20.977
How do you suggest we explain
that there will be no funeral

11:20.978 --> 11:24.647
because a doctor wants to open
her up and study her insides?

11:26.817 --> 11:29.084
Mrs. Horner, you feel the same?

11:29.219 --> 11:31.987
My wife is not in a place
to think rationally.

11:32.021 --> 11:33.756
Can't you see that?

11:35.892 --> 11:37.726
Look, you have my heartfelt sympathies,

11:37.961 --> 11:41.195
but you must understand that
I'm trying to save girls

11:41.296 --> 11:43.665
like your daughter with my work.

11:47.169 --> 11:48.837
But let's be frank here, your daughter

11:48.838 --> 11:51.158
isn't the only person in the
family who has a problem.

11:52.508 --> 11:55.476
You have as much interest
in finding a cure as I do.

11:55.711 --> 11:59.780
You help me, and perhaps with
what I learn, I can help you.

12:02.384 --> 12:05.886
I'll work as fast as I can and
you can bury her in a few days.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.221
You won't cut her face?

12:10.024 --> 12:12.425
I'll protect it with my life.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.594
You promised I'd have my fee, Mr. Cleary.

12:14.862 --> 12:17.964
And you'll have it. Mrs. Showalter
here is gonna cover all your costs.

12:18.231 --> 12:20.991
You've heard of the Showalters, yeah?
Probably own this building.

12:21.201 --> 12:24.737
Be that as it may, if I don't have
the amount at my office by tomorrow,

12:24.872 --> 12:26.739
your nun will need to
find another lawyer.

12:37.717 --> 12:39.183
You didn't have to come.

12:39.251 --> 12:40.685
I should have come sooner.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.621
You're here now.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.708
All rise.

13:04.843 --> 13:07.777
The Honorable Parkinson
Bothamly presiding.

13:10.448 --> 13:11.814
Be seated.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.719
Mr. Whitting, you asked for
this pretrial hearing, correct?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.320
I did, Your Honor.

13:18.456 --> 13:23.659
In front of me are 16
past cases thrown out

13:23.860 --> 13:25.989
due to proven entrapment by
the New York Vice Department.

13:25.990 --> 13:28.030
All of which have no relevance here.

13:28.164 --> 13:30.331
Each case on its own merits, Counselor.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.101
But an examination of the
files will clearly show

13:33.336 --> 13:36.404
uncommon similarities between
those wrongly accused citizens

13:36.473 --> 13:38.606
and my client Sister Harriet.

13:38.641 --> 13:40.440
I think it only fair...

13:40.642 --> 13:43.711
Do not tell me what is fair in
my courtroom, Mr. Whitting.

13:45.814 --> 13:48.582
"Lo, children are a
heritage from the Lord

13:48.717 --> 13:52.319
and the fruit of the
womb is His reward."

13:52.320 --> 13:54.021
Excuse me?

13:54.022 --> 13:55.790
Psalm 127.

13:56.057 --> 13:59.392
I'm surprised the devil allows you
to remember any verse, Miss Dolan.

13:59.393 --> 14:02.128
But hear me,

14:02.296 --> 14:04.731
the devil will not influence
me in my decisions.

14:04.966 --> 14:07.701
He is no more a power over me
than your pretender in Rome.

14:07.702 --> 14:08.802
Your Honor!

14:08.870 --> 14:10.269
<i>You have shown the true</i>

14:10.371 --> 14:13.173
murderous nature of your people.

14:13.340 --> 14:17.509
I will use this courtroom
and the strength of my God

14:17.744 --> 14:20.879
to sound a warning against the
people now flooding our shores

14:21.047 --> 14:25.718
and let real Americans
know exactly what you are.

14:28.989 --> 14:31.889
<i>The trial will formally
commence on the 15th.</i>

14:33.592 --> 14:34.872
<i>- Next case.
- (bangs gavel)</i>

14:43.435 --> 14:45.870
What the fuck just happened?

14:51.910 --> 14:53.777
Gallinger: <i>You haven't
seen the new club yet.</i>

14:53.778 --> 14:55.645
Yale built theirs down the street.

14:55.713 --> 14:57.413
It's almost 12 stories.

14:57.549 --> 15:00.450
But you'll see ours
is far more tasteful.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.187
Is this how I used to do it?

15:05.188 --> 15:07.890
Of course.

15:07.925 --> 15:09.925
It looks wrong to me.

15:09.927 --> 15:12.228
It looks lovely.

15:12.262 --> 15:13.929
I can start again.

15:16.199 --> 15:17.933
Are you all right, Ellie?

15:19.703 --> 15:22.971
I just want everything to
be right for you, Everett.

15:23.205 --> 15:26.407
You always used to love to show
me off to your classmates.

15:26.609 --> 15:30.078
Now I'm afraid there's not
much left to brag about.

15:30.079 --> 15:32.180
Nonsense.

15:33.816 --> 15:36.417
You will always be

15:36.586 --> 15:38.786
the most beautiful girl
in the world to me.

15:38.887 --> 15:42.189
But I've lost so much weight.

15:42.290 --> 15:45.325
My dress will be hanging off of me.

15:45.326 --> 15:47.260
And my color...

15:47.261 --> 15:49.562
It's just a...

15:49.764 --> 15:53.166
class reunion with a bunch
of boring Penn Medical men

15:53.167 --> 15:55.635
and their wives.

15:55.803 --> 15:58.437
Far too many of whom also
happen to be their cousin.

15:58.505 --> 16:01.507
What would I even say to them?

16:01.609 --> 16:04.143
That I've recently been locked away?

16:04.144 --> 16:06.612
And the dinner...

16:06.747 --> 16:09.615
what if one of my teeth comes loose?

16:12.652 --> 16:15.153
<i>(chatter)</i>

16:25.197 --> 16:27.098
Gallinger.

16:27.133 --> 16:29.034
Ah, there you are.

16:29.035 --> 16:30.434
Griscom and Lloyd.

16:30.602 --> 16:33.437
If you find one, you'll
always find the other.

16:33.538 --> 16:36.106
(chuckles) Looking well, Everett.

16:36.341 --> 16:39.710
We're now in practice in Rye
in our own hospital together.

16:39.711 --> 16:41.011
(clinks)

16:41.046 --> 16:42.847
Must be a fine institution.

16:43.048 --> 16:45.549
And you're still slicing them
up at the Knick, I presume?

16:45.550 --> 16:46.750
Yes.

16:46.884 --> 16:49.518
Certainly made of stronger
stuff than we are.

16:50.554 --> 16:52.788
Henny, it's lovely to see you.

16:52.857 --> 16:54.390
Mary, how are all your people?

16:54.458 --> 16:56.125
Political, as always.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.562
There's usually an Ingersoll
campaigning for something somewhere.

16:59.697 --> 17:02.365
Where is Eleanor? I'd love to see her.

17:02.466 --> 17:05.532
Visiting relatives on Long Island.

17:05.734 --> 17:08.569
I'm afraid she left me to face
the class of '91 all by myself.

17:08.672 --> 17:10.672
Well, it's only for one night.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.574
Or has she left you for good?

17:12.642 --> 17:14.376
- (laughs)
- Ooh.

17:14.477 --> 17:17.512
No, she'll be back. I'm sure of it.

17:17.512 --> 17:19.281
Pardon me.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.855
Drexler: You've seen the
streets of this city.

17:27.990 --> 17:30.557
The dregs of the world are coming here.

17:30.726 --> 17:34.595
Every country emptying
their slums into our ports.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.964
Italians, Jews,

17:36.999 --> 17:39.165
any Semite, really,

17:39.266 --> 17:42.602
Slavs with their darkness and filth,

17:42.670 --> 17:45.305
gypsies and homosexuals,

17:45.539 --> 17:50.510
the dim-witted, infirm, and
defective everywhere we look.

17:50.578 --> 17:53.446
But among them, the Negro,

17:53.547 --> 17:55.680
the one we brought here ourselves,

17:55.782 --> 17:58.550
he could be the largest danger of all.

17:58.618 --> 18:00.986
Gallinger, good to see you.

18:01.054 --> 18:03.022
Don't let me interrupt.

18:03.190 --> 18:05.024
Van Pelt: We were just
discussing eugenics.

18:05.025 --> 18:09.161
Drexler and I are both teaching
courses on the subject this year.

18:09.229 --> 18:10.996
Do you know much about it?

18:11.031 --> 18:13.531
Heard a few things.

18:13.699 --> 18:16.034
Breed the best with the
best to get the best.

18:16.202 --> 18:19.404
But it's just as important
that the laggards,

18:19.438 --> 18:21.272
the worst of our species,

18:21.406 --> 18:23.808
don't get the chance
to continue their line

18:23.909 --> 18:26.344
or contaminate a better one.

18:26.445 --> 18:29.879
And Negroes are the largest threat?

18:30.081 --> 18:33.450
There's a reason that as a
people they've never succeeded.

18:33.584 --> 18:36.753
Science is proving their weak intellect

18:36.821 --> 18:39.222
and innate lack of character.

18:39.290 --> 18:41.224
If they continue to breed,

18:41.392 --> 18:45.195
if they, heaven forbid,
begin to mix in with us,

18:45.296 --> 18:47.396
we'll forfeit potential greatness

18:47.497 --> 18:50.266
for the mongrelization of our species.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.301
Van Pelt: <i>Forgive us our preaching.</i>

18:52.502 --> 18:56.638
Drexler and I are both a bit
evangelical on the subject.

18:56.740 --> 18:59.108
Rockefeller, Carnegie, Harriman,

18:59.276 --> 19:01.010
they're all putting
money towards teaching.

19:01.011 --> 19:02.778
Colleges and medical schools

19:02.912 --> 19:05.513
are adding eugenics courses in droves.

19:05.514 --> 19:07.215
It's the future.

19:07.316 --> 19:09.884
And it's coming just in time.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.124
All: <i>Amen.</i>

19:23.698 --> 19:25.866
Speak freely, brother.

19:27.302 --> 19:29.669
Confess yourself without fear.

19:30.839 --> 19:33.007
You're in the presence of God.

19:34.509 --> 19:36.543
- I have thieved.
- Amen.

19:36.544 --> 19:39.145
My whole life.

19:39.313 --> 19:42.448
- I stole from my employer.
- Amen, brother.

19:42.616 --> 19:45.618
- I stole from my wife's widowed mother.
- Amen.

19:45.686 --> 19:48.287
Anybody else I could dupe.

19:48.488 --> 19:52.458
- I made promises I knew I would never keep.
- Amen.

19:52.526 --> 19:54.426
I hurt anybody who ever loved me

19:54.527 --> 19:57.595
and I never felt a moment of regret.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.531
Amen, brother.

19:59.732 --> 20:03.735
Instead, I felt a vain glory
for having succeeded in it.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.404
Amen.

20:05.571 --> 20:08.907
But I succeeded nothing
outside of destroying myself.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.510
I know that God is punishing me,

20:13.511 --> 20:15.579
but I hope,

20:15.580 --> 20:17.915
I pray

20:18.050 --> 20:20.751
that He can see just
how much I've changed.

20:20.752 --> 20:23.620
Stay on the path

20:23.688 --> 20:25.523
and His forgiving light

20:25.590 --> 20:28.258
will soon shine down upon you.

20:29.593 --> 20:31.561
Amen. Amen.

20:31.562 --> 20:33.696
All: Amen.

20:34.698 --> 20:37.567
Who else among us...

20:39.436 --> 20:43.239
needs to unburden themselves tonight?

20:51.214 --> 20:53.215
I have a heavy heart.

20:57.453 --> 20:59.121
The heart of a sinner.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.293
My daughter.

21:06.561 --> 21:08.296
Works as a nurse.

21:08.397 --> 21:11.599
She's seen some vile, awful sickness,

21:11.867 --> 21:16.337
but nothing comes close to the
disease Satan can infect in you.

21:16.405 --> 21:19.439
The cure... confession.

21:22.043 --> 21:24.578
Open up that medical kit, Lucy.

21:26.781 --> 21:29.682
Take out that medicament
and cast the devil out.

21:33.721 --> 21:35.688
Go on, Cricket.

21:50.337 --> 21:53.904
- Bertie: Right, are you ready?
- (laughs)

21:54.073 --> 21:56.034
I can't believe you
haven't been here before.

21:58.911 --> 22:02.113
(chatter)

22:07.486 --> 22:09.320
Here we are.

22:09.422 --> 22:11.555
So when you did your exposé,

22:11.689 --> 22:13.890
how were you able to gather
all that information

22:13.992 --> 22:16.460
without anyone becoming suspicious

22:16.527 --> 22:18.395
or getting drugged yourself?

22:18.596 --> 22:20.997
Well, I seduced the orderlies
with filthy stories

22:21.032 --> 22:23.267
and erotic pictures.

22:23.268 --> 22:24.801
Really?

22:24.802 --> 22:26.703
(laughs)

22:26.704 --> 22:29.238
No. No.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.641
- No, of course not.
- Oh.

22:31.675 --> 22:33.276
No, I paid them off.

22:33.444 --> 22:37.313
Ahem, a well-offered
bribe can be an art.

22:37.348 --> 22:39.382
Perhaps I'll bribe you.

22:39.516 --> 22:41.484
- To do what?
- (flash powder pops)

22:43.387 --> 22:45.153
I'll think of something.

22:45.221 --> 22:47.922
But you liked the article?

22:47.991 --> 22:49.924
Oh, I loved the article.

22:50.159 --> 22:53.528
But I don't want people thinking
all medicine is like that.

22:53.629 --> 22:55.797
Psychiatry is a very new field

22:55.965 --> 22:58.700
and things always look
worse at the beginning.

23:00.136 --> 23:02.636
Not all things.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.771
No, not all things.

23:04.806 --> 23:07.241
(fiddles playing)

23:14.582 --> 23:17.418
Well, that's why I'm
writing about Zinberg.

23:17.419 --> 23:18.718
Right.

23:18.819 --> 23:21.020
A positive story about medicine.

23:22.589 --> 23:24.190
And if it happens to show a Jew

23:24.358 --> 23:26.759
who isn't a Lower East
Side ghetto peasant,

23:26.760 --> 23:28.828
all the better.

23:28.996 --> 23:31.197
Before I met Zinberg,
the only Jews I had met

23:31.332 --> 23:33.766
were destitute patients at the Knick.

23:35.335 --> 23:38.303
Hmm. Well, now you know two who aren't.

23:39.439 --> 23:41.506
You?

23:41.541 --> 23:43.542
Jewish? (laughs)

23:43.576 --> 23:46.111
Yeah, from head to toe.

23:46.212 --> 23:48.313
But don't worry, it's not catching.

23:48.415 --> 23:51.416
No, no, no, it's... I didn't mean...

23:51.584 --> 23:54.518
it's just that... it's just
Genevieve Everidge is a very...

23:54.520 --> 23:56.387
Goyisha name?

23:56.422 --> 23:57.921
- Well...
- Yeah.

23:58.023 --> 24:00.023
Yeah, it reeks of old money.

24:00.092 --> 24:02.326
A finishing school girl.

24:02.361 --> 24:04.695
But you aren't?

24:04.696 --> 24:07.064
Maybe I am.

24:07.199 --> 24:09.966
No one knows and I don't want them to.

24:10.068 --> 24:13.570
When you read Genevieve Everidge,

24:13.704 --> 24:16.339
she's anything you want her to be.

24:18.742 --> 24:22.145
And I doubt people would feel
the same way about Esther Kohn,

24:22.280 --> 24:24.947
a shirtmaker's daughter from Pittsfield.

24:27.117 --> 24:29.551
I would.

24:29.719 --> 24:33.121
Said Columbia University's
Bertram Chickering Jr.

24:33.323 --> 24:36.659
The only Presbyterian surgeon
at Mount Sinai Jews' Hospital.

24:37.927 --> 24:40.362
Hmm.

24:40.497 --> 24:43.698
Seems we're both swimming
in each other's ponds.

25:05.753 --> 25:07.688
How lucky am I?

25:10.825 --> 25:12.826
You're always so sweet to me.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.930
Well, I do love to be with you,

25:17.964 --> 25:19.832
however infrequent.

25:22.603 --> 25:24.570
I should be more attentive.

25:40.719 --> 25:42.654
I do like that.

25:50.129 --> 25:52.229
Phillip: And when I do this?

25:52.330 --> 25:54.365
Cornelia: That's nice, too.

26:04.809 --> 26:06.243
That wasn't so bad, was it?

26:06.244 --> 26:08.145
(chuckles)

26:08.146 --> 26:09.912
No.

26:09.913 --> 26:12.081
It was nice.

26:12.082 --> 26:14.550
(laughs)

26:15.452 --> 26:17.253
Ahem.

26:20.691 --> 26:22.358
Is it too soon to ask
if you feel pregnant?

26:22.359 --> 26:23.926
(laughs)

26:25.695 --> 26:26.895
It doesn't work that way.

26:26.962 --> 26:28.563
No? How would you know?

26:30.866 --> 26:32.768
I work in a hospital.

26:33.803 --> 26:35.670
Did work.

26:42.811 --> 26:45.145
I went and saw Sister Harriet today.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.682
Why would you do that?

26:48.817 --> 26:52.486
She's my friend and she's
really up against it.

26:52.554 --> 26:55.022
The judge was brutal.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.758
Well, she's not a very
sympathetic defendant.

26:57.959 --> 27:01.227
And her lawyer costs more
than she could ever afford.

27:01.295 --> 27:04.163
I was thinking we could help her.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.401
What?

27:08.569 --> 27:11.270
You're asking me to help
fund a baby killer.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.272
She helped women in trouble.

27:13.307 --> 27:14.941
She's a murderer.

27:16.610 --> 27:18.277
How can someone who wants to have a baby

27:18.278 --> 27:20.196
possibly sympathize
with someone like that?

27:22.449 --> 27:25.083
Did you know that she
was aborting babies?

27:25.151 --> 27:27.085
You said she was your friend.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.488
- You must have.
- No.

27:29.489 --> 27:31.690
Of course not.

27:33.692 --> 27:36.026
Stay away from her.

27:36.094 --> 27:38.830
Only God can save her now.

28:34.550 --> 28:36.684
(snorts)

28:40.489 --> 28:42.589
(snorts)

28:49.931 --> 28:52.799
(moaning)

29:28.133 --> 29:30.101
John?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.803
<i>Abby.</i>

29:42.481 --> 29:44.347
Thanks.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.316
How long were you away?

29:46.317 --> 29:48.452
Too long.

29:49.953 --> 29:52.021
But you're better now?

29:52.089 --> 29:54.557
Yeah, yeah. I feel good.

29:54.558 --> 29:57.159
Really.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.895
How are you?

29:58.962 --> 30:01.263
Your arm bothering you?

30:01.331 --> 30:03.933
Been having muscle spasms.

30:03.934 --> 30:05.668
Anything else?

30:07.771 --> 30:10.238
Insomnia.

30:10.339 --> 30:12.608
<i>The headaches are much worse.</i>

30:14.744 --> 30:17.713
Well, you should have come to see me.

30:17.747 --> 30:19.681
<i>What for, John?</i>

30:19.682 --> 30:23.218
There's no cure.

30:23.352 --> 30:26.053
And we both know where
I'm ultimately headed.

30:31.092 --> 30:32.960
Lucy: <i>Looks like it was a good night.</i>

30:35.431 --> 30:37.798
People give more when they feel worse.

30:42.169 --> 30:44.704
Just as long as they feel
better when they leave, right?

30:50.778 --> 30:52.712
I know I feel better.

30:54.816 --> 30:56.850
Do you?

30:58.952 --> 31:01.053
<i>I do.</i>

31:07.293 --> 31:09.194
While I was up there...

31:12.031 --> 31:15.332
I honestly could feel
forgiveness wash over me.

31:15.367 --> 31:19.103
<i>I felt lighter, safer.</i>

31:21.507 --> 31:23.607
<i>I felt free.</i>

31:31.183 --> 31:33.449
Girl, you is far from free.

31:35.753 --> 31:39.589
The spittle you let fly
from your wretched mouth

31:39.724 --> 31:43.393
<i>was the most disgusting,
humiliating sewage</i>

31:43.427 --> 31:45.295
<i>my ears have ever heard.</i>

31:47.331 --> 31:50.900
Daddy, I had to confess.

31:53.737 --> 31:56.138
<i>How else could I be welcomed
back into God's arms?</i>

31:56.239 --> 31:58.574
You think God is just gonna...

31:58.675 --> 32:01.143
forgive a stupid girl like you?

32:02.946 --> 32:05.480
You not only made yourself look foolish,

32:05.548 --> 32:06.981
you made me look worse.

32:07.116 --> 32:10.251
- I didn't mean to.
- No, you didn't mean to.

32:10.352 --> 32:13.221
Just like you didn't mean to lie.

32:14.857 --> 32:17.525
Didn't mean to steal.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.928
To take a drug.

32:20.062 --> 32:22.563
To fuck a stranger. I should have known.

32:22.731 --> 32:25.899
I said to your mama since
the day you was born

32:25.934 --> 32:28.035
how dumb you was.

32:28.036 --> 32:29.837
(gasps)

32:29.871 --> 32:32.439
<i>(Lucy crying)</i>

32:32.541 --> 32:34.875
You know why I call you Cricket?

32:34.976 --> 32:37.077
Because that's what you sound like.

32:37.078 --> 32:39.079
(panting)

32:39.247 --> 32:41.981
Every time you speak,
it makes my skin crawl.

32:43.283 --> 32:45.651
<i>And tonight...</i>

32:45.653 --> 32:48.654
<i>tonight...</i>

32:48.923 --> 32:51.239
- <i>(belt buckle clinks) - ...it took
the power of the Almighty for me</i>

32:51.240 --> 32:53.492
<i>not to squash you while you
was chirping away in church.</i>

32:53.493 --> 32:54.994
Daddy.

32:56.263 --> 32:58.429
Please.

32:58.497 --> 33:00.832
- Daddy.
- Don't make it worse.

33:00.833 --> 33:03.068
Please. Please.

33:03.269 --> 33:05.509
- Please don't.
- You know what you earned yourself.

33:12.511 --> 33:14.945
(crying)

33:16.448 --> 33:18.482
(whimpers)

33:18.584 --> 33:22.019
- (smacking)
- (crying)

33:24.590 --> 33:27.691
Leo: <i>The Polish doctor discovered
the gland secretion existed.</i>

33:27.826 --> 33:30.027
Doc at Johns Hopkins
thought he'd crystalized it,

33:30.261 --> 33:33.496
but turned out he had only
isolated a benzoyl derivative.

33:33.631 --> 33:36.266
Then this Japanese
fellow on 103rd Street,

33:36.333 --> 33:38.101
he crystalized it for real.

33:38.102 --> 33:39.202
Genius.

33:39.336 --> 33:41.037
No, the genius was that he patented it.

33:41.038 --> 33:42.839
He's the one who called it adrenaline.

33:45.009 --> 33:47.210
Hmm.

33:47.311 --> 33:49.812
His heart's beating rapidly.

33:50.013 --> 33:53.015
We're just looking to see if it
cures his sniffles to start.

33:57.020 --> 33:59.721
There might be side effects to consider.

33:59.723 --> 34:01.523
Or other uses.

34:03.359 --> 34:06.460
So how was your little
excursion to Huber's Palace

34:06.495 --> 34:09.831
with the girl writer?

34:09.965 --> 34:11.764
You're already the talk of the hospital.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.766
The charming <i>shaygetz.</i>

34:13.869 --> 34:16.204
She's like no one I've known.

34:16.237 --> 34:18.639
The things she's seen.

34:18.741 --> 34:20.708
I'm worried I'm no match for her.

34:22.043 --> 34:23.909
(grunts)

34:26.748 --> 34:30.449
We might consider
trying on larger animals

34:30.484 --> 34:32.118
or even humans.

34:32.319 --> 34:35.521
Dr. Zinberg is very specific
about his protocols.

34:36.757 --> 34:38.757
Start on mice.

34:38.824 --> 34:41.426
Present our findings.

34:41.494 --> 34:44.529
Then on to rats, guinea pigs.

34:44.697 --> 34:48.033
Then cats, dogs, pigs,
and only then to humans.

34:50.070 --> 34:53.038
Well, we could at least try injecting
the drug in different doses.

34:53.106 --> 34:55.974
Just the sniffles, Chickering.

34:56.074 --> 34:57.808
You can be aggressive around here,

34:57.943 --> 34:59.944
but we don't go in for sloppy or stupid.

34:59.945 --> 35:02.113
Of course.

35:03.615 --> 35:06.017
What do you mean no match?

35:06.185 --> 35:08.419
You trying to bed her or
beat her in badminton?

35:08.520 --> 35:11.822
I'm not trying to bed her, Leo.

35:13.958 --> 35:16.860
If it came to that,

35:17.028 --> 35:20.430
I worry I'm not experienced
enough for her

35:20.531 --> 35:22.966
the way an older man might be.

35:22.967 --> 35:24.834
Ah.

35:24.969 --> 35:28.738
There's experience out
there for the taking.

35:28.773 --> 35:31.207
I get mine every Tuesday

35:31.308 --> 35:34.476
at a Negro brothel on 29th Street.

35:34.611 --> 35:37.646
As experiences go,
it's worth every penny.

35:37.647 --> 35:39.581
(chuckles)

35:46.623 --> 35:49.324
The papers are signed.

35:51.828 --> 35:53.728
You have your subway partner.

35:53.930 --> 35:57.032
Did you convince your father
to sell some of his ships?

35:57.233 --> 36:01.002
I've been able to find some
savings for the company

36:01.170 --> 36:04.071
which I think could be put
to better use elsewhere.

36:04.139 --> 36:06.006
Better than in reinvesting?

36:06.241 --> 36:09.509
How does your father feel about
you betting against him?

36:09.510 --> 36:12.112
He doesn't know.

36:12.247 --> 36:14.614
<i>And I'd like to keep it that way.</i>

36:14.916 --> 36:19.153
If he wants to stay blindly adrift in
the 19th century, that's his business.

36:21.989 --> 36:24.223
Now here's to ours.

36:35.803 --> 36:38.924
Gallinger: It shouldn't be difficult
to excise from the base of the tumor.

36:39.973 --> 36:42.174
Yes, there it is.

36:47.546 --> 36:50.149
We will now bisect the healthy
liver tissue leading to the tumor

36:50.150 --> 36:52.917
and tie off all blood
vessels contained within.

36:53.119 --> 36:55.119
(quietly) Or we could
simply strangle the vessels

36:55.120 --> 36:56.913
leading to the tumor and not
bother the healthy liver.

36:56.914 --> 36:58.109
Which would be lazy.

36:58.110 --> 37:00.524
As opposed to slicing the liver
further, which would be idiotic.

37:00.525 --> 37:03.325
There is no idiocy in removing blood
supply for any future tumors.

37:03.395 --> 37:07.098
It will be done delicately and
the decision has been made.

37:08.533 --> 37:10.534
Nurse Pell.

37:10.669 --> 37:12.509
Please hand Dr. Gallinger a clean scalpel

37:12.536 --> 37:14.070
with our thinnest blade
so he may carry out...

37:14.172 --> 37:17.040
- You want me to do it?
- Yes.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.708
Yes.

37:26.417 --> 37:30.219
I will now bisect the healthy liver
tissue leading to the tumor...

37:31.721 --> 37:36.125
and tie off each blood
vessel contained within.

37:55.777 --> 37:58.446
Edwards.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.981
Can I get your assistance
in Pathological?

38:01.083 --> 38:02.783
I think I might be onto something.

38:02.784 --> 38:04.617
Let's go.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.355
Thack.

38:08.356 --> 38:10.223
Yes?

38:15.063 --> 38:17.697
Why do you always go to him?

38:17.732 --> 38:19.666
What do you mean?

38:19.800 --> 38:22.834
Why do you always
choose Edwards over me?

38:24.738 --> 38:27.673
Well, this is simply something
for which he's better suited.

38:30.543 --> 38:34.313
It was me who saved you.

38:35.916 --> 38:37.515
And I'm eternally grateful.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.218
You know my appreciation
for you is not an issue here.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.288
I just need someone with whom I
can work with on this research.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.057
Since he started here,

38:46.292 --> 38:48.993
Edwards has invented and improved
procedure after procedure,

38:49.061 --> 38:50.828
technique after technique.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.831
Everett, if you want
to collaborate with me,

38:55.100 --> 38:59.203
then jealousy won't serve you a tenth
as well as ambition and effort.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.841
Thackery: <i>So that's the enemy.</i>

39:04.910 --> 39:08.545
The syphilis spirochete.

39:09.747 --> 39:13.416
Our goal is to kill that bastard.

39:13.417 --> 39:15.684
Eloquent.

39:15.786 --> 39:17.853
How do you propose to do that?

39:17.955 --> 39:21.056
So I read in this Austrian journal

39:21.258 --> 39:24.693
that several syphilis patients
inexplicably improved.

39:24.995 --> 39:28.330
The only link was that all had been
suffering from various other illnesses...

39:28.431 --> 39:31.600
strep, pneumonia, meningitis.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.383
I've heard similar stories in Europe.

39:33.384 --> 39:35.637
The belief is that the syphilis
spirochete was killed off

39:35.638 --> 39:38.273
by something in the strep
or the pneumococcus.

39:38.441 --> 39:40.675
No, that wasn't what
killed the syphilis at all.

39:40.843 --> 39:43.512
I have tried to kill that
thing under the microscope

39:43.547 --> 39:44.813
with everything I can think of.

39:44.814 --> 39:47.047
Anything I can safely
put in a human body.

39:47.049 --> 39:48.081
Nothing worked.

39:48.150 --> 39:50.017
I thought it was indestructible

39:50.152 --> 39:53.754
until finally it died
on its own one night

39:54.022 --> 39:57.224
while I was working under the light
of several lamps focused on my work.

39:57.326 --> 40:00.661
- It's light sensitive?
- No.

40:00.662 --> 40:03.029
It's the heat.

40:03.230 --> 40:06.332
I was baking under those lamps
and so was the disease.

40:08.302 --> 40:10.870
Syphilis can be killed by temperature.

40:10.871 --> 40:12.738
How high?

40:12.840 --> 40:15.575
106, 107 degrees Fahrenheit.

40:15.576 --> 40:17.109
(chuckles)

40:17.244 --> 40:19.744
If I can induce a fever
in a syphilis patient

40:19.812 --> 40:22.047
and get it high enough,

40:22.148 --> 40:24.149
I can bake the disease to death.

40:24.250 --> 40:27.586
Yes, and the patient in the process.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.754
You are talking about lethal temperatures.

40:29.856 --> 40:33.292
Yes, to cure a lethal disease.

40:36.595 --> 40:38.563
(sighs)

40:38.763 --> 40:42.032
Suppose you could induce the
fever using something curable.

40:42.101 --> 40:44.602
- Like what?
- Malaria.

40:44.803 --> 40:47.538
It's a deadly disease
inducing terribly high fever,

40:47.639 --> 40:50.308
but with a relatively dependable cure.

40:50.309 --> 40:51.909
Quinine.

40:51.943 --> 40:53.943
Well, let's try it.

40:54.112 --> 40:56.580
(scoffs) We would need
extensive research.

40:56.614 --> 40:58.081
The risks are enormous.

40:58.149 --> 40:59.849
No, no, that could take years.

40:59.917 --> 41:02.819
I don't have that time.

41:05.456 --> 41:06.756
You?

41:06.757 --> 41:10.659
No, Abby.

41:10.793 --> 41:14.363
She's developing motor
coordination problems.

41:15.432 --> 41:18.234
You know, the blood vessels in her brain

41:18.301 --> 41:21.169
are swelling and clotting.

41:21.304 --> 41:24.673
Won't be long before the seizures come.

41:24.674 --> 41:26.608
The thrombosis.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.543
And death.

41:40.822 --> 41:42.690
Where do we start?

41:43.792 --> 41:46.526
Where we usually do,

41:46.528 --> 41:48.528
with a pig.

41:52.033 --> 41:54.593
Wingo: <i>Yes, changes are always
expected during construction,</i>

41:54.669 --> 41:56.437
<i>but what you're asking
is quite extensive.</i>

41:56.438 --> 41:59.105
Well, the board thinks the matter

41:59.274 --> 42:01.274
important enough to
implement the changes.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.208
Well, I understand the Inebriety Ward,

42:03.444 --> 42:06.179
but some of these things you're
asking for make very little sense.

42:06.180 --> 42:09.848
Changing ceiling heights,
moving walls, why?

42:09.883 --> 42:11.817
It's all very disruptive,

42:12.052 --> 42:14.353
not to mention it will cost a
fortune in materials and manpower.

42:14.455 --> 42:16.088
The board wants what it wants.

42:16.156 --> 42:17.390
Then I should speak to them.

42:17.391 --> 42:19.791
Mr. Wingo, I sympathize,

42:19.892 --> 42:21.993
but questioning the board to their faces

42:22.128 --> 42:24.396
is not a recipe for keeping your job.

42:24.397 --> 42:26.030
I should know.

42:26.132 --> 42:27.732
I fought these on your behalf

42:27.866 --> 42:31.269
and nearly found myself
out on the street.

42:31.370 --> 42:34.138
I don't want that fate to befall you,

42:34.407 --> 42:37.908
a man who does not have nearly the
history with these men that I do.

42:40.078 --> 42:42.780
Thank you for your counsel.

42:42.847 --> 42:44.315
The changes will be made.

42:44.316 --> 42:46.116
Good.

42:46.318 --> 42:49.119
Make me a list of the extra
materials you'll need

42:49.254 --> 42:53.055
and I'll send them along
to the contractors.

42:53.090 --> 42:55.090
Where is the tender?

42:55.192 --> 42:56.926
Where's the fire tender, damn it?

42:57.027 --> 42:58.127
Who's supposed to be on watch?

42:58.128 --> 43:00.062
It's Mr. Blackledge, sir.

43:00.164 --> 43:02.231
I think he went to piss. (chuckles)

43:02.399 --> 43:04.399
Well, when he buttons up,
tell him he's fired.

43:04.401 --> 43:06.803
He can follow that piss down the hole.

43:06.870 --> 43:08.571
You're the new tender now.

43:08.772 --> 43:10.939
Make sure the fires don't go out
and don't burn the place down

43:11.107 --> 43:13.542
or you can follow Blackledge
and his piss. Understood?

43:13.610 --> 43:16.077
- Understood?
- Yes, Mr. Wingo.

43:16.078 --> 43:18.046
Go.

43:20.116 --> 43:21.483
Well done, Frazier.

43:21.551 --> 43:23.352
I won't allow negligence.

43:23.386 --> 43:26.620
Perhaps just to be safe,

43:26.788 --> 43:30.991
we should slow construction
down a bit despite the cost.

43:31.126 --> 43:33.994
We don't want to take
any unnecessary risks.

43:35.930 --> 43:38.098
I have to be hard on these men.
They have to know who's boss.

43:38.099 --> 43:40.300
Of course.

43:40.435 --> 43:44.003
I have always said a little bit of fear

43:44.071 --> 43:46.606
can be a very good thing.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.019
- Jimmy.
- You piece of shit.

44:01.221 --> 44:03.316
- You're...
- Not in a fucking hole in the ground?

44:03.317 --> 44:05.239
- No, I ain't.
- I had nothing to do with it.

44:05.240 --> 44:06.992
I swear I do not know
who took out Bunky.

44:06.993 --> 44:08.427
And sliced me up good.

44:08.562 --> 44:11.663
Bellevue boys sewed me
up like a rag doll.

44:11.764 --> 44:15.033
But here I am. And here you are.

44:15.068 --> 44:16.968
Jimmy, please...

44:17.070 --> 44:20.004
I ain't here to bust you up.

44:20.105 --> 44:22.473
I'm just delivering a message.

44:22.575 --> 44:24.742
You got to come to Tammany Hall

44:24.910 --> 44:27.412
and make your accounts
for this here building.

44:27.446 --> 44:29.313
You work for Tammany?

44:29.448 --> 44:32.617
Yeah. And I ain't Jimmy to you no more.

44:32.685 --> 44:35.084
People call me formal now.

44:35.119 --> 44:38.054
I'm Mr. James Fester.

44:39.691 --> 44:41.691
You'd do well to remember that.

44:46.097 --> 44:47.898
Okay.

45:10.819 --> 45:13.822
Mr. Barrow gave me very
specific instructions

45:14.022 --> 45:16.524
that I must have a written
report of the patient's ailment

45:16.659 --> 45:18.526
before I can dispense
any of the narcotics.

45:18.527 --> 45:21.663
And only to a doctor or a nurse.

45:23.165 --> 45:24.833
Answer me this, then.

45:24.967 --> 45:27.468
How am I supposed to write a report

45:27.569 --> 45:29.470
from Houston Street or wherever

45:29.738 --> 45:32.873
when I've just picked up a body that's
been kicked in the chest by a mule?

45:33.007 --> 45:37.778
Now, having those drugs on the ambulance

45:38.012 --> 45:42.182
could be the difference between
putting them on the ward

45:42.250 --> 45:44.717
or putting them in the morgue.

45:54.094 --> 45:55.928
Good news, Herman.

45:56.096 --> 45:59.731
I was at the club last night
carousing with the fellows

45:59.832 --> 46:03.034
and we got to talking about you.

46:03.102 --> 46:05.537
I've now got enough backers

46:05.705 --> 46:08.106
to bring you in to
interview for membership.

46:08.107 --> 46:10.008
Really?

46:10.042 --> 46:11.242
<i>Not to worry.</i>

46:11.377 --> 46:12.877
<i>I'll be by your side the whole time</i>

46:12.878 --> 46:15.113
trumpeting your worthiness.

46:16.548 --> 46:17.915
Least I can do.

46:18.016 --> 46:20.951
- Thank you.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

46:24.723 --> 46:27.591
<i>- (people chatting)
- (piano playing)</i>

46:30.729 --> 46:32.763
Thank you.

46:42.306 --> 46:44.874
Junia: I didn't want
to keep you waiting.

46:44.975 --> 46:47.010
I had to finish my school studies

46:47.110 --> 46:49.311
and do my hair just right for you.

46:49.380 --> 46:51.079
I hope you'll forgive me.

46:51.113 --> 46:52.915
Excuse me, I am next.

46:52.982 --> 46:55.483
Hermie, sorry. I didn't see you.

46:55.585 --> 46:58.253
Apparently not. Hello, Judge Corwin.

46:58.254 --> 47:00.422
Herman.

47:00.623 --> 47:03.692
It's just that I've been so
distracted with my school studies

47:03.827 --> 47:05.861
<i>and doing my hair just right for you.</i>

47:05.962 --> 47:07.662
<i>Please don't be mad, Hermie.</i>

47:07.763 --> 47:10.765
You know how special you are to me.

47:10.932 --> 47:13.601
And to the judge and to
that fat fellow before him

47:13.669 --> 47:15.502
and to the Spaniard before him.

47:15.604 --> 47:18.405
Yes, I have been waiting that long.

47:18.507 --> 47:20.841
Ever since you obtained a new boss,

47:21.009 --> 47:23.410
it seems harder than ever to see you.
Why is that?

47:23.612 --> 47:26.813
Did he take out an advertisement
in "The Morning Telegraph"?

47:26.981 --> 47:30.383
Hmm? Is there a billboard
of you on Broadway?

47:30.485 --> 47:33.653
- Are you jealous?
- (scoffs)

47:33.855 --> 47:37.591
I just thought you would always
want me at the head of the line.

47:37.592 --> 47:39.392
I do.

47:39.594 --> 47:42.327
It's not my fault. They
make me do it that way.

47:43.797 --> 47:46.599
I am not an idiot, Junia.

47:46.700 --> 47:50.302
I'm well aware this is a job for you.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.371
(sighs)

47:55.375 --> 47:57.776
I just thought you and I

47:57.944 --> 48:00.845
would always be more than
another six-dollar sale.

48:00.846 --> 48:02.580
Oh.

48:04.116 --> 48:05.683
You are.

48:08.353 --> 48:10.755
When I go to sleep at night,

48:10.823 --> 48:13.691
I think of your sweet smile.

48:13.793 --> 48:16.693
I dream of your hugs and kisses.

48:18.329 --> 48:21.098
And when I wake, I count the
hours until I see you again.

48:21.165 --> 48:23.166
You know I do, don't you?

48:23.167 --> 48:25.068
Yes.

48:27.204 --> 48:30.040
I wish I could be with
only you all the time.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.844
I'm trapped here.

48:34.878 --> 48:37.079
And you're all I have.

48:38.882 --> 48:41.250
A life with you is all I dream of.

48:42.920 --> 48:46.288
- I'm sorry.
- Shh.

48:46.323 --> 48:48.423
Don't you be sorry.

48:50.526 --> 48:53.762
It is not your fault you ended up here.

48:57.333 --> 49:00.101
Is that really what you want?

49:01.537 --> 49:03.204
You want to be with me?

49:05.074 --> 49:07.041
More than anything in the world.

49:11.012 --> 49:12.212
Then you will be.

49:12.246 --> 49:14.948
(crowd cheering)

49:31.565 --> 49:33.833
There we go.

49:33.901 --> 49:36.635
That should guarantee it.

49:39.874 --> 49:42.540
All right, Otto,

49:42.609 --> 49:44.877
let's get you delira and excira.

49:44.878 --> 49:46.778
Arm.

49:48.381 --> 49:51.049
(whispering)

49:51.150 --> 49:53.651
You ready? Ready? Come on! Come on!

49:55.755 --> 49:57.355
No cheap shots. Shake hands.

49:57.456 --> 49:59.016
- Cleary: Come on, boyo!
- Wrestle!

49:59.057 --> 50:01.959
Come on!
Rip his fucking arm off!

50:02.995 --> 50:05.596
Yeah!

50:06.665 --> 50:08.098
Come on!

50:08.099 --> 50:10.101
Come on!

50:12.270 --> 50:14.304
- (crowd booing)
- (shouting stops)

50:14.305 --> 50:16.773
Otto. Otto.

50:16.774 --> 50:18.875
Otto!

50:19.010 --> 50:22.712
- Man: <i>Otto!</i>
<i>- Man #2: Come on, get up!</i>

50:24.849 --> 50:26.149
Shit.

50:27.818 --> 50:29.953
(pig grunting)

50:50.205 --> 50:52.874
(squealing)

50:59.548 --> 51:01.149
Here.

51:04.119 --> 51:06.419
105.

51:06.454 --> 51:08.621
Our syphilitic sow

51:08.723 --> 51:11.892
is now three degrees above normal.

51:13.628 --> 51:16.462
We have no idea if quinine will
even cure malaria in a pig.

51:16.530 --> 51:18.631
Well, in five more degrees,

51:18.733 --> 51:20.667
we'll load her up with it and find out.

51:20.802 --> 51:24.170
In the meantime, we let the fever rage.

51:24.204 --> 51:26.338
You've got a visitor.

51:26.339 --> 51:28.007
Excellent.

51:28.041 --> 51:29.842
Thank you, gentlemen.

51:29.977 --> 51:32.178
I need to begin a full dissection

51:32.212 --> 51:35.047
of this girl's body.

51:35.248 --> 51:39.084
And I'll return in an hour and
take the pig's temperature.

51:39.319 --> 51:42.086
You know, if people actually
knew what you did in here,

51:42.254 --> 51:44.722
they wouldn't trust you to
give them a fucking aspirin.

51:44.724 --> 51:47.058
(men chuckle)

51:57.335 --> 51:59.436
<i>(phone rings)</i>

52:08.713 --> 52:10.613
Yes?

52:11.582 --> 52:13.450
Put it through.

52:19.356 --> 52:21.858
(rings)

52:21.892 --> 52:24.460
(clears throat)

52:24.528 --> 52:26.929
Dr. Edwards speaking.

52:29.266 --> 52:31.132
What?

52:33.435 --> 52:35.270
Right now?

52:43.112 --> 52:45.229
Evaline: <i>Have another piece of cake.
I made it myself.</i>

52:45.230 --> 52:46.248
Woman: <i>I shouldn't.</i>

52:46.482 --> 52:48.682
<i>There's only so many pounds
a girl can dance away.</i>

52:48.750 --> 52:50.517
Evaline: <i>You can afford it.</i>

52:50.719 --> 52:53.820
<i>Algie went on and on about
how pretty you were,</i>

52:53.955 --> 52:56.190
<i>but he didn't do your
silhouette justice.</i>

52:59.394 --> 53:02.229
<i>(woman laughs)</i>

53:02.297 --> 53:05.098
Algie, look who's here.

53:10.404 --> 53:12.471
Opal.

53:21.481 --> 53:23.048
Hello, sweet.

53:23.149 --> 53:26.318
We finally get to meet
this wife of yours

53:26.452 --> 53:29.687
after hearing about her
for all these months.

53:29.689 --> 53:31.756
It's been so long.

53:31.858 --> 53:34.993
Let me get my arms around you again.

53:35.128 --> 53:37.495
She sailed into Boston on the Saxonia

53:37.530 --> 53:39.363
day before yesterday.

53:39.364 --> 53:40.864
Boston?

53:40.966 --> 53:43.500
Where I thought you would be.

53:43.602 --> 53:45.769
But I learned my mistake.

53:45.938 --> 53:48.439
This country is so big
with so many cities.

53:48.506 --> 53:50.374
I came here straightaway.

53:50.375 --> 53:52.509
To my parents?

53:52.611 --> 53:54.611
Who greeted me like family.

53:54.679 --> 53:57.113
Because that's what you are.

53:57.148 --> 53:59.249
That's what I am.

54:01.285 --> 54:04.287
Also a mess after all this travelling.

54:04.355 --> 54:06.022
I need to freshen up a bit.

54:06.157 --> 54:07.924
Absence may make the heart grow fonder,

54:08.159 --> 54:11.394
but a little bit of lip rouge
will make the heart beat quicker.

54:11.495 --> 54:14.663
Down the hall just to the right.

54:14.697 --> 54:16.565
Won't be a moment.

54:26.643 --> 54:29.211
Who on earth is that woman?

54:30.646 --> 54:33.414
She is my wife just as she said she is.

54:33.715 --> 54:37.085
You think that's something you might
want to tell us, that you got married?

54:37.219 --> 54:39.720
Boy, that's not something
you just forget about.

54:39.822 --> 54:41.922
I guess I hoped that she would.

54:42.024 --> 54:44.725
You should have told us. Why'd you lie?

54:46.395 --> 54:48.895
(sighs)

54:48.930 --> 54:51.164
It happened so fast.

54:53.101 --> 54:55.202
We were in Paris.

54:55.369 --> 54:58.405
Medicine was going well.
People were accepting me.

54:58.439 --> 55:02.142
We met and I was happy.

55:04.912 --> 55:06.578
- But then...
- But then.

55:06.713 --> 55:09.015
There is always a "but then" with you.

55:09.116 --> 55:10.682
You run hot and then you run cold.

55:10.750 --> 55:12.718
And then you run and run.

55:12.953 --> 55:15.633
How in the world did you think
this wouldn't catch up with you?

55:15.655 --> 55:17.356
I don't even know what she wants.

55:17.457 --> 55:19.191
I know exactly what she wants.

55:19.259 --> 55:21.159
That girl is determined.

55:24.496 --> 55:26.164
What did I miss?
