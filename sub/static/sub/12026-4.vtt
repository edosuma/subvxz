<i>It's kind of funny putting</i>

to step it up this year for me,
and here's his opportunity,

03:49.396 --> 03:51.296
so let's hope he can deliver.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.431
I've got three rules.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.066

listen to everything

03:54.068 --> 03:56.068
but don't bring your (bleep)
knowledge here.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.369
My second (bleep) rule,

03:57.371 --> 03:59.238
never let them know
how smart you are.
Mike: Gotcha.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.974
My third (bleep) rule,
don't give a (bleep),

04:01.976 --> 04:03.609
because the less you give
a (bleep), man,

04:03.611 --> 04:05.410
the happier your (bleep)
trip is going to be.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.945
I'm telling you the truth.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.380
Mike:
So I was talking to Mark

04:08.382 --> 04:10.849
and he said he kind
of wants me to uh,

04:10.851 --> 04:12.651
me to follow behind
for the first trip,

04:12.653 --> 04:15.988
so I'll hold off
on the super truckin'.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.158
So I'll just be following
behind,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.361

for you.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.263

04:24.265 --> 04:25.764
is here's a guy that thinks
he knows everything

04:25.766 --> 04:28.066
and he's in for a rude (bleep)
awakening.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.003

I guess we're off.
