00:03.733 --> 00:05.052
So, what are your plans?

00:05.253 --> 00:07.813
My two best seasons
were with the Rangers...

00:07.973 --> 00:10.965
...so I think here
is my best chance to capitalize.

00:11.133 --> 00:14.330
I saved a few dollars. I'm looking
at a couple bar opportunities.

00:14.493 --> 00:17.132
- One over here on 14th.
- You were spying on me?

00:17.293 --> 00:19.090
No, not spying.

00:19.293 --> 00:23.206
I know it's all my fault. I'm just trying
to find a way to turn things around.

00:23.373 --> 00:25.682

OFFICER 1: Kid got stomped.
- DOA?

00:52.693 --> 00:54.684
He's still alive,
but his skull's bashed in.

00:54.893 --> 00:56.884
She saw it and those guys over there.

00:57.053 --> 00:58.281
I'll go talk to these guys.

OFFICER 1: Marie DeLucci.

OFFICER 2: All right. Thanks.
- Marie, I'm Detective Simone.

01:04.053 --> 01:06.806
I guess he's dead, isn't he?
Is he dead?

01:06.973 --> 01:10.329
They say he's badly hurt.
Can you tell me what you saw?

01:10.493 --> 01:11.926
It was two of them.

01:12.093 --> 01:15.290
The first guy came out with
a baseball bat and he knocked him down.

01:15.453 --> 01:17.683
And then he started hitting him
and kicking him.

01:17.893 --> 01:21.966
And then another one came up in a car,
jumped out and hit and kicked him too.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.169
That's when I went over there
to the grocery.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.528
- He was yelling to them in Italian.
SIMONE: Who's that?

01:26.733 --> 01:27.927
MARIE:
The grocer was.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.124
Then they jumped in the car
and drove away.

Did you get a look at the plate number?

01:32.413 --> 01:34.244
MARIE:
No, I didn't really look at the car.

01:34.453 --> 01:36.091
It was an ordinary car. It was blue.

- Can you tell me anything else?
- They looked really strong.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.130

- I'm Detective Sipowicz.

- Bruno and I did.

Well, Bruno doesn't speak
too much English.

02:04.813 --> 02:06.451
No, he speaks Italian.

02:06.613 --> 02:09.332
- I'm shaking over what happened here.
- Which was what?

02:09.532 --> 02:11.444
Well, Bruno was making me
my sandwich.

I get breakfast here every morning.
A salami sandwich.

- Sickening.
- Did you ever see them before?

02:23.533 --> 02:25.649
I've seen the kid
they stomped around, I think.

SIPOWICZ: What about the other guys?
HO YT: I didn't recognize them.

02:28.453 --> 02:30.250
How would you describe them?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.332
Mesomorphs.

02:32.493 --> 02:35.053
- Mesomorphs?
- Two mesomorphs.

02:35.213 --> 02:37.204
- I don't know what that is.
- Muscly guys.

02:37.413 --> 02:41.247
- Are you some kind of teacher?
- I'm a painter. I got a loft up the street.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.967
It just came over the radio.
The kid's DOA.

Well, my car got vandalized.
Insurance said I need to file a report.

- Yeah. They did a job.

punctured the tires.

04:54.013 --> 04:55.810
- Any idea who did it?
- No. No idea.

04:56.013 --> 04:58.891
I got to the bar around 8 at night.
I closed at 4 a.m.

04:59.093 --> 05:01.527
- That's when I found it.
- This happened once before?

05:01.733 --> 05:05.123
Five days ago. Pricks punctured the tires
so they can't be patched.

05:05.333 --> 05:09.292
To tell you the truth, this type of case
has what we call a low solvability factor.

05:09.453 --> 05:12.445
I'm here because my insurance guy said
if I don't talk to you...

05:12.653 --> 05:13.847
...he can't pay the claim.

- Harold knows. Don't you, Harold?

there's not much we can do.

12:32.533 --> 12:37.766
Sometimes it's drugs mixed
in these things. Did Carlos deal or use?

12:37.933 --> 12:40.128
- No.
- He run with a gang?

12:40.293 --> 12:44.002
- Uh-uh. He did his own thing.
- His own thing? What would that be?

12:44.213 --> 12:47.091
- He was a tagger.
- He was a tagger, huh?

12:47.253 --> 12:49.721
What about that?
That's got the look, man.

12:49.933 --> 12:53.005
- He did beautiful tags.
- Yeah. That's sensational.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.289
You know if Carlos
was in a beef with anybody?

12:55.493 --> 12:57.848
Witnesses saw him attacked
by two white guys.

12:58.053 --> 12:59.964
He was in Little Italy.

13:01.253 --> 13:02.891
Guinea sons of bitches!

13:03.053 --> 13:05.283
- I hope they all die!
- Who are you talking about?

13:05.493 --> 13:08.610
He was warned by some guineas
about tagging in their neighborhood.

13:08.813 --> 13:10.724
You know who they are?
You ever seen them?

13:10.893 --> 13:13.168
No. He said, "Guineas."

13:13.733 --> 13:16.406
All right, thanks for you help, Amalia.
Where do you live?

13:16.573 --> 13:19.212
80919th Street, 2B.

13:19.373 --> 13:21.967
Hey, Amalia, what's all the talk, huh?

13:22.893 --> 13:25.202
- They customers?
- Yeah.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.165
He's such an asshole.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.444
I'm going home. I don't feel good.

13:30.613 --> 13:33.844
JIMENEZ: You can't go! Come back here!
AMALIA: Go screw yourself.

13:34.053 --> 13:35.805
SIPOWICZ:
Another community service murder.

13:35.973 --> 13:38.533
Yeah, I'm not crazy about
graffiti either, Andy.

13:38.693 --> 13:42.732
- This kid was brained with a bat.
- Yeah. Maybe that's a little strong.

13:54.573 --> 13:58.566
Woman dropped a dime on them. She'd
seen them chasing a Puerto Rican kid.

13:58.733 --> 14:01.531
- She saw him get stomped?
- No. They chased him off her block.

14:01.693 --> 14:04.287
Couldn't see what happened.
She hears about the homicide.

14:04.453 --> 14:08.605
An hour ago, she's looking out her
window and sees them outside the Ucilli.

14:08.773 --> 14:11.003
- Loudmouth Frankie Pisciotta's place?
- Yeah.

14:11.173 --> 14:12.652
SIMONE: This woman give her name?
FANCY: No.

14:12.813 --> 14:15.407
She stayed on the line
until we picked them up.

14:15.613 --> 14:17.444
This girlfriend said he was a tagger...

14:17.653 --> 14:20.850
...and he was threatened by some
Italians in Little Italy for tagging.

14:21.013 --> 14:24.085
Looks like they qualify. Ran them
through BCI, they got no sheets.

14:24.253 --> 14:28.007
- Maybe they're ambitious boys.
- Uniform gave them Miranda warnings.

14:28.173 --> 14:29.811
Take them to One and Two, would you?

14:29.973 --> 14:33.090
Maybe we should get photos on these
guys in case they won't stand a lineup.

14:33.253 --> 14:35.483
- Yeah.
- I'll get the camera.

14:36.453 --> 14:37.852
Detective?

14:40.853 --> 14:43.606
- You drop her off?
- Yeah, I waited till the locksmith left.

14:43.773 --> 14:46.810
- How'd she seem?
- Well, you know, somewhat upset.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.409
- All right. Thanks a lot for taking her.
- All right. No problem.

14:50.773 --> 14:54.243
- Sylvia get home all right?
- Yeah. The locksmith just left.

14:54.413 --> 14:57.485
They say you don't have to change
them after a purse snatch.

14:57.653 --> 14:59.006
Can't do any harm.

14:59.413 --> 15:02.723
Uh, she seemed somewhat upset...

15:02.893 --> 15:05.726
...and I figured it would help
her peace of mind.

15:11.213 --> 15:13.488
- See what you got there?
OFFICER: Yeah.

15:14.693 --> 15:17.765
SIMONE: Jerry Panetti.
- That's right.

15:17.973 --> 15:20.089
SIMONE: Want something to
drink, Jerry? Some coffee?

15:20.293 --> 15:22.249
No. I don't want nothing.

15:22.413 --> 15:25.450
- How old are you?
- 19.

15:25.653 --> 15:27.848
SIMONE: Do you work over at the Ucilli?
PANETTl: Yeah.

15:28.053 --> 15:31.966
- Your buddy, Paul, he works there too?
- Yeah. We're busboys.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.169
SIMONE: You working this morning?
- No.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.130
Were you out with Paul?

15:36.693 --> 15:38.604
- This morning?
SIPOWICZ: Yeah, this morning, Jerry.

15:38.773 --> 15:41.890
And this better be the truth because
we got a report from a witness.

15:42.093 --> 15:44.084
- My right to remain silent?
- You can.

15:44.253 --> 15:47.689
You got the right to an attorney,
what you say can be used against you.

15:47.853 --> 15:49.002
So, what's the answer?

15:49.213 --> 15:51.681
- To what?
- What did you and Paul do this morning?

15:51.853 --> 15:54.003
Nothing. We just hung out.

15:54.853 --> 15:57.242
All right. Were you riding around
in a car?

15:57.973 --> 15:59.611
A little bit.

15:59.773 --> 16:01.968
SIMONE: Whose car?
- Paul's car.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.012
Just cruised around.

16:04.173 --> 16:07.882
Driving around Elizabeth Street? Up
around Grand? Up near Bruno's Market?

16:08.053 --> 16:10.647
No. We didn't go that way.
We went down the other way.

16:10.813 --> 16:15.250
Jerry, do you know anybody
named Carlos Herrera? Chato?

16:15.453 --> 16:17.648
Nope. Who's that?

16:17.853 --> 16:21.413
He's a kid that was killed this morning
across the street from Bruno's Market.

16:21.413 --> 16:21.970
He's a kid that was killed this morning
across the street from Bruno's Market.

16:22.173 --> 16:24.926
- Beat to death with a ball bat.
- I never heard of him.

16:25.093 --> 16:28.483
SIMONE: Cruising around, did you see
anybody getting chased? Getting hurt?

16:28.693 --> 16:30.923
- Anybody getting attacked?
- No.

16:31.133 --> 16:34.648
You got nothing to tell us about Chato
Herrera getting assaulted and killed?

16:34.853 --> 16:37.003
I don't know anything about that.

16:37.173 --> 16:38.367
Let me tell you something.

16:38.573 --> 16:41.963
We got somebody who saw you chasing
somebody down the street this morning!

16:42.173 --> 16:44.209
Not me, man.
It had to be somebody else.

16:44.373 --> 16:47.809
All right, you sit here and think about
this while we talk to your buddy.

16:47.973 --> 16:51.682
If he tells different than what you said,
you're gonna be jammed up here.

16:51.853 --> 16:53.047
SIPOWICZ:
Hey.

16:55.213 --> 16:58.205
- What's that for?
- My scrapbook.

17:03.213 --> 17:04.248
Deep thinker, huh?

17:04.453 --> 17:07.888
Yeah, with these guys, you gotta
wonder if the gene pool dried up.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.325
Paul Bellini.

17:18.492 --> 17:20.723
- Are you asking me or telling me?
- What?

17:21.532 --> 17:23.012
Hey.

17:23.492 --> 17:25.801
- Your name's Paul Bellini, right?
- Yeah.

17:25.973 --> 17:29.124
Were you riding around in a car
with Jerry Panetti this morning?

17:29.293 --> 17:31.602
- I decline that.
- What do you mean you decline it?

17:31.813 --> 17:34.646
We have a witness that puts you
at an incident this morning.

17:34.813 --> 17:37.008
We're looking to clear that up.

17:37.173 --> 17:40.210
- I decline that incident.
- He declines that too.

17:40.733 --> 17:44.203
- You work over at the Ucilli, don't you?
PAUL: It's a free country, right?

17:44.413 --> 17:46.449
SIMONE: That's Frank Pisciotta's place?
- You bet.

17:46.613 --> 17:48.569
SIMONE: Your boss have a policy
on taggers, Paul?

17:48.733 --> 17:50.883
Because everyone knows
he's got a temper.

17:51.053 --> 17:53.567
- He get pissed off about graffiti?
- Listen to this.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.803
You wanna talk to me, I want a lawyer.

17:55.973 --> 17:59.170
If Crazy Frankie sent the busboys
to brain this guy, Paul...

17:59.373 --> 18:01.364
...you want to get out
in front of that now.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.728
It wasn't your idea.
Things went out of control.

18:03.933 --> 18:06.572
I decline that answer.
I want to talk to a lawyer...

18:06.773 --> 18:08.604
...and I'm declining my entire rights.

18:11.453 --> 18:13.444
Say "moron," Paul.

18:18.613 --> 18:20.683
- Pisciotta brought lawyers.
- Pisciotta.

18:20.893 --> 18:23.930
In the old days, that cokehead would've
been whacked before he was 25.

18:24.133 --> 18:26.693
I'm Jack Palermo.
That's my associate, Joel Fineman.

18:26.853 --> 18:29.572
My clients are Panetti and Bellini.
Have they been charged?

18:29.733 --> 18:31.849
- Not yet.
- Then I would like them released.

18:32.053 --> 18:34.123
- Why did you guys arrest these kids?
- Whoa, hey.

18:34.293 --> 18:35.408
These are good boys.

18:35.573 --> 18:38.929
Yeah? They trustworthy types? Did
you loan them your Louisville Slugger?

18:39.133 --> 18:40.885
Could you produce my clients, please?

18:41.093 --> 18:42.685
SIMONE:
What do you know about that tagger?

18:42.853 --> 18:46.687
Some asshole got what was coming
to him. That's got nothing to do with us.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.884
- That's not what we heard.
- Yeah? From who?

18:49.053 --> 18:51.521
- Where's your witnesses?
- Let us help you with that.

18:51.693 --> 18:54.730
We'll get you a list so you can
threaten everybody alphabetically.

18:54.893 --> 18:56.770
We're verging
on unlawful detention here.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.491
There's your clients.

19:00.253 --> 19:02.244
PISCIOTTA: How are you doing?
- Okay, Mr. Pisciotta.

19:02.413 --> 19:04.449
Listen. Go along with the lawyers, huh?

19:04.613 --> 19:07.332
Frank takes care of his fellas.
You work for me, I work for you.

19:07.533 --> 19:10.331
That's the first guy over 5'6"
I ever seen work for you.

19:10.493 --> 19:14.486
Don't you guys have some kind of height
requirement on your job applications?

19:14.653 --> 19:15.881
What I heard, detectives...

19:16.053 --> 19:19.489
...this P.R. Tagger wrote, "Jose's a fag."
He got someone pissed off.

19:19.653 --> 19:21.245
Get out of here, Pisciotta.

19:22.973 --> 19:25.248
I think there's your hot lead.
Locate some Joses.

19:25.413 --> 19:27.449
Yeah, tell your story
while you're walking.

19:27.613 --> 19:29.604
Don't get a nosebleed, Frankie.

19:29.773 --> 19:33.686
PISCIOTTA: Heights. Nosebleeds.
- Frankie and his guinea pygmies.

19:33.853 --> 19:36.686
- We got photos of the busboys.
- Bring the witnesses in.

19:36.893 --> 19:40.966
Yeah, Frank's probably out on the street
now urging them to cooperate.

19:54.733 --> 19:58.487
MEDAVO Y:
I don't know if you noticed, Donna...

19:58.653 --> 20:01.486
...but I was speaking
with Harold Rutansky before.

20:01.653 --> 20:05.885
I don't know why. Detective Martinez
was taking that report.

20:06.053 --> 20:10.490
Come on. That man was part
of your life for what, a whole year?

20:10.653 --> 20:13.929
He may be part of it again
for all I know.

20:14.093 --> 20:16.448
You know what happened
to Harold's car, Gregory?

20:16.613 --> 20:17.841
MEDAVO Y:
It was vandalized.

20:18.053 --> 20:20.044
You know anything about that?

20:22.013 --> 20:25.210
- What, you think maybe I did it?
- I don't know what to think.

20:26.093 --> 20:27.731
What'd I do, Donna?

20:27.893 --> 20:32.011
Maybe I hung around Harold Rutansky's
bar until the street was deserted.

20:32.173 --> 20:35.848
And then I took an ice pick to
his tires and a key to his bodyworks.

20:36.013 --> 20:39.608
- Is that how you got me figured?
- I'm sorry for asking that. I apologize.

20:39.773 --> 20:41.365
How could you make that accusation?

20:41.573 --> 20:45.486
I apologize.
I don't know what to think anymore.

20:46.893 --> 20:48.690
Donna, what is going on here?

20:49.853 --> 20:52.572
I have never been so unhappy.

20:52.733 --> 20:55.406
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.923
Please, can't we get together
tonight and talk?

21:01.093 --> 21:05.086
No, Greg. The last thing I want
right now is you and me talking more.

21:05.293 --> 21:06.965
- I'll only get more upset.
- Yeah.

21:07.173 --> 21:08.133
Okay, okay.
I don't want to make you upset.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.122
Okay, okay.
I don't want to make you upset.

21:09.293 --> 21:10.806
SIMONE:
This is Detective Simone.

21:10.973 --> 21:13.168
We're gonna be putting together
a lineup.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.483
Could you round me up
some possible suspects?

21:15.653 --> 21:17.211
I hope you feel better.

21:31.893 --> 21:34.487
SIMONE: Listen, if you could
just have them give me a call.

21:34.653 --> 21:37.725
- Yeah. Detective Simone.
- I want to see Detective Simone.

21:37.893 --> 21:40.327
- Detective Simone's over there.
- Thanks.

21:40.493 --> 21:43.246
Officer Simone? I'm Jim DeLucci.

21:43.453 --> 21:46.684
You contacted my daughter Marie
about the lineup business.

21:46.853 --> 21:50.323
She's not coming in. She's not gonna
be pointing the finger at nobody.

21:50.533 --> 21:52.205
We're investigating a homicide.

21:52.413 --> 21:55.485
Somebody was murdered. Your
daughter's very important to this case.

21:55.653 --> 21:58.121
I don't want her involved.
I'm not gonna allow it.

21:58.333 --> 22:02.724
- She said she was willing to cooperate.
- I don't give a damn. She's 15.

22:02.933 --> 22:06.130
I'm responsible for her. And I'm not
letting you put her through this.

22:06.293 --> 22:08.523
She's leaving town.
She's not gonna be available.

22:08.693 --> 22:11.287
She's not coming in
and she's not gonna testify.

22:11.453 --> 22:14.889
- I understand all your concerns here.
- I'm not stupid.

22:15.973 --> 22:19.409
My family, they walk through
that neighborhood every day.

22:19.573 --> 22:21.165
- Did somebody threaten you?
- Nobody.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.607
- Nobody?
- Nobody.

22:22.773 --> 22:24.445
Because we can offer protection.

22:24.613 --> 22:27.286
If she makes an ID,
we may not need her at the trial.

22:27.453 --> 22:30.286
Just forget about my daughter,
and we'll leave it at that.

22:30.453 --> 22:32.489
She's having nothing to do with this.

22:32.653 --> 22:35.008
Just leave her alone.

22:38.173 --> 22:39.162
No more phone calls.

22:39.373 --> 22:41.733
MAN:
I need Fancy's signature on this now.

22:44.773 --> 22:46.172
No.

22:53.093 --> 22:54.492
No.

22:55.413 --> 22:57.244
They're not in there, huh, Bruno?
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

22:57.453 --> 22:59.284
He knows what I'm saying.

22:59.453 --> 23:02.843
You understand more than you let on,
don't you, Bruno?

23:03.053 --> 23:05.203
You understand "Frank Pisciotta"?

23:05.413 --> 23:09.292
What did he say to you? Pick these
guys out and watch your grocery burn?

23:09.493 --> 23:11.484
You want me to translate?

23:16.693 --> 23:21.369
No. <i>Finito,</i> Bruno.
You're done. Come on.

23:27.293 --> 23:30.171
- Did you want to see someone?
- Mr...

23:30.333 --> 23:32.688
- The detective. What's his name?
- Sipowicz?

23:32.893 --> 23:35.123
Yeah. He left a call for me.
My name's Hoyt.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.370
- Mr. Hoyt. You got the message, huh?
HO YT: Yeah, I did.

23:38.533 --> 23:39.693
SIMONE: We wanted you to take a look
at a couple of pictures.

23:39.693 --> 23:40.921
SIMONE: We wanted you to take a look
at a couple of pictures.

23:41.093 --> 23:43.049
- Hey, Bruno.
- Hello, Mr. Hoyt.

23:43.253 --> 23:45.926
- They got you down here too, huh?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.249
How's it going, Walter?

23:48.413 --> 23:50.210
Okay. Bruno's kind of disturbed, huh?

23:50.373 --> 23:52.967
I was telling him we wanted
him to look at the pictures.

23:53.173 --> 23:56.051
Yeah, come here. Have a seat.
Sit over there.

23:56.213 --> 23:58.886
This is in connection with this morning?

23:59.053 --> 24:03.251
Tell us if you recognize
any of these people. If so, from where?

24:07.613 --> 24:10.332
- That's one of them.
- Tell me where you recognize him from.

24:10.493 --> 24:14.327
He's one of the guys who beat that kid.
He was the one with the bat.

24:14.493 --> 24:16.165
Look at these.

24:19.093 --> 24:22.085
That's the other guy.
The one that jumped out of the car.

24:22.293 --> 24:25.683
We're gonna arrange some lineups.
We want you to stick around for that.

24:25.853 --> 24:28.048
- How long will that take?
- Could be a few hours.

24:28.253 --> 24:29.447
I can't. I've got a night job.

24:29.653 --> 24:32.087
SIPOWICZ: Could they give
you the night off?

24:32.253 --> 24:33.925
I need the money.

24:35.053 --> 24:38.045
Okay, we'll see if we can set it up
in the morning.

24:38.213 --> 24:41.922
- Did Bruno pick the same guys?
- I can't discuss that with you.

24:42.133 --> 24:44.328
We'll call you and let you know
when to come in.

24:44.493 --> 24:45.608
Okay.

24:46.133 --> 24:47.168
Listen, thanks.

24:47.333 --> 24:49.688
We really appreciate
your cooperation on this.

24:50.453 --> 24:52.762
- I heard that kid was a tagger.
SIMONE: Yeah, he was.

24:54.133 --> 24:57.045
Some of those guys do interesting work.

25:01.453 --> 25:05.082
Get the feeling this guy doesn't realize
that Pisciotta will reach out.

25:05.613 --> 25:06.602
Yeah.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.331
After he makes this ID...

25:08.533 --> 25:12.367
...Walter might want to check into
one of them artists' colonies.

25:23.693 --> 25:27.208
You know, it's not necessary, James,
you being out here with me.

25:27.413 --> 25:29.210
No problem.
I wasn't busy tonight anyhow.

25:29.373 --> 25:32.888
Yeah. You'd only have been sleeping.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.044
I mean, I know it's a long shot.

25:35.213 --> 25:37.727
You might grab the guy.
He's done this twice, right?

25:37.893 --> 25:40.361
He vandalized this car repeatedly.

25:41.573 --> 25:44.292
I can't stand her thinking it was me.

25:44.733 --> 25:47.691
Donna's not thinking straight right now
is all I can figure.

25:47.853 --> 25:52.324
That she would think that
I could deface this guy's automobile.

25:52.533 --> 25:55.730
- That I'd be capable of that.
- You wonder what gets in their minds.

25:57.133 --> 25:59.249
The truth is...

25:59.413 --> 26:01.768
...I feel it's me that's made her upset.

26:01.933 --> 26:04.925
If her thinking's off kilter,
it's at my doorstep.

26:05.413 --> 26:07.722
I've exhibited jealousy...

26:07.893 --> 26:10.327
...and didn't trust her enough.

26:10.533 --> 26:13.889
I've also shown a lack of fun in life...

26:14.053 --> 26:16.965
...and how much I enjoyed
our relationship.

26:17.133 --> 26:19.044
I didn't get that across to her.

26:19.213 --> 26:21.443
A little time.
It'll straighten things out, Greg.

26:21.613 --> 26:23.604
Yeah. I don't know.

26:24.413 --> 26:27.689
It may have deteriorated
to too great an extent.

26:31.773 --> 26:35.083
- Why don't you go home, James?
- No, I'll hang around a while, all right?

26:43.173 --> 26:45.448
I was a skater when I was a kid.

26:46.293 --> 26:46.693
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:46.693 --> 26:47.489
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:48.333 --> 26:50.210
Out on Long Island.

26:52.053 --> 26:54.772
That's one of the first things
her and I did.

26:56.773 --> 26:58.968
Me and Donna went ice skating.

27:13.773 --> 27:15.286
Thanks a lot.

27:27.293 --> 27:29.090
That was Phil DeNatale on the phone.

27:29.253 --> 27:32.529
They recovered your purse and ID.
Some gin mill men's room.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.048
- Your keys were in it.
- Good.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.721
He said they'll get it back
to you tomorrow.

27:37.893 --> 27:41.283
- I wish you'd eat something.
- Maybe later.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.530
- You're gonna get sick if you don't...
- I will eat when I'm hungry.

27:54.693 --> 27:56.126
Sylvia.

27:56.893 --> 27:59.202
- Did this guy lay hands on you?
- No.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.523
You seem so upset.

28:12.453 --> 28:16.924
My purse was stolen once before
in law school.

28:17.373 --> 28:19.284
Uh-huh.

28:19.693 --> 28:21.968
And I was attacked.

28:24.853 --> 28:27.413
After he stole my purse...

28:28.773 --> 28:31.367
...he forced me into a stairwell.

28:32.173 --> 28:34.892
And he assaulted me sexually.

28:37.213 --> 28:39.090
I got raped.

28:39.653 --> 28:41.211
Sylvia...

28:42.013 --> 28:46.291
- So this brought a lot of that back.
- Yeah.

28:47.373 --> 28:49.762
They catch the guy?

28:50.933 --> 28:53.322
I didn't report it right away.

28:55.653 --> 28:57.883
I had a lot of trouble with it...

28:58.613 --> 29:00.490
...emotionally.

29:00.773 --> 29:03.446
Took me six weeks to come forward.

29:03.613 --> 29:05.843
I'd like to kill the guy.

29:08.533 --> 29:10.922
I didn't tell you before...

29:12.093 --> 29:14.243
...because I hated it so much.

29:15.293 --> 29:18.012
I hated thinking about it.

29:19.653 --> 29:21.132
Sure.

29:25.613 --> 29:27.569
I was afraid...

29:30.813 --> 29:34.203
...that you would think
of me differently.

29:43.453 --> 29:45.045
No.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.327
I think you're beautiful.

29:57.493 --> 29:59.484
And I love you.

30:16.613 --> 30:19.889
Hey. Hey, what's this?

30:22.213 --> 30:23.771
It's nothing.

30:24.613 --> 30:27.047
When do you think
you might want to call it a night?

30:27.213 --> 30:30.808
What did Rutansky say?
He leaves around 4.

30:32.253 --> 30:34.483
I don't know if I got
two more hours left in me.

30:34.653 --> 30:37.531
- I was up late last night.
- Yeah. You had that driving job.

30:37.733 --> 30:41.965
I'm looking to put a few dollars away.
Get a down payment for a house.

30:43.453 --> 30:46.331
Go home, James.
I got the portable radio if I need help.

30:46.493 --> 30:49.371
- Sector car knows you're here?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'll be all right.

30:49.573 --> 30:50.972
All right.

30:51.173 --> 30:54.006
I really appreciate you
hanging out with me.

30:54.173 --> 30:54.853
It's no problem.

30:54.853 --> 30:55.330
It's no problem.

30:55.493 --> 30:57.723
- I'll see you in the morning, all right?
- Yeah.

30:58.573 --> 31:02.612
- I'll see you at the house.
- Greg, don't exhaust yourself, all right?

31:02.773 --> 31:04.411
Don't worry.

31:04.573 --> 31:06.962
That don't do anyone
any good, am I right?

31:07.773 --> 31:09.843
Yeah. It's a good point.

31:26.573 --> 31:28.291
FANCY:
Morning, Greg.

31:29.213 --> 31:31.363
- Greg?
- Huh?

31:31.573 --> 31:35.088
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. How you doing, lieu?

31:35.253 --> 31:37.813
I was just catching 40 winks.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.410
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31:51.613 --> 31:54.002
I look like a storm drain, huh?

31:54.173 --> 31:57.324
- Yeah, I was up all night.
- Yeah? Why?

31:57.493 --> 32:01.850
I grabbed up the guy
on that vandalism complaint.

32:02.013 --> 32:03.924
- The guy that keyed Harold's car?
- Uh-huh.

32:04.093 --> 32:07.085
I gave the collar to a radio car team.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.329
Rutansky didn't know
the guy from Adam.

32:09.493 --> 32:13.372
Turns out that him and a guy were
in an altercation a couple years ago.

32:13.573 --> 32:15.564
The guy's an unruly fan.

32:15.733 --> 32:19.043
Rutansky clocked him one night
outside the Garden.

32:20.093 --> 32:24.848
Anyway, the guy recognized
Rutansky in his bar last week.

32:25.053 --> 32:29.763
He watched what car he got into.
The next night he starts doing bodywork.

32:29.973 --> 32:32.123
RUTANSKY: How's it going?
- Yeah. How you doing?

32:32.293 --> 32:33.726
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi, Harold.

32:33.893 --> 32:35.929
You gonna sign
that corroborating affidavit?

32:36.093 --> 32:39.130
Yeah, I'm meeting those two
uniform cops. We're gonna go to court.

32:39.293 --> 32:42.251
Greg caught that guy
vandalizing my car.

32:42.413 --> 32:43.812
So I understand.

32:44.013 --> 32:47.608
I don't even remember the guy. I got
in a fight with him a few years ago.

32:47.773 --> 32:49.365
Well, I'm glad he was apprehended.

32:49.533 --> 32:50.932
RUTANSKY:
You're my guardian angel.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.852
Every time we rub shoulders,
something good happens for me.

32:54.053 --> 32:57.443
- Anyway, thanks again.
- Yeah, no problem. Just doing my job.

32:57.653 --> 32:58.642
Sure.

32:58.813 --> 33:01.327
- Take care, Donna.
- Take care, Harold.

33:05.933 --> 33:07.412
That was very nice of you.

33:07.573 --> 33:10.610
So I'm out from under the cloud?

33:10.773 --> 33:12.889
No longer a suspect?

33:13.933 --> 33:16.527
- No longer a suspect.
- Good.

33:17.373 --> 33:18.692
I feel a lot better.

33:18.893 --> 33:21.851
- We should talk later, Greg.
- Yeah. Good. I'd like that.

33:23.173 --> 33:24.526
MARTINEZ:
How's it going, Greg?

33:24.733 --> 33:26.246
- Okay. How's yourself?
- All right.

33:26.413 --> 33:28.529
- Sarge said you collared up on that guy.
- Yeah.

33:28.693 --> 33:30.411
I gave him to the guys in the sector.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.882
- I miss everything.
- All you had to do was go home.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.964
- Morning, Donna.
- Morning.

33:37.133 --> 33:40.443
Well, I gotta shave.
We'll talk later, huh?

33:40.613 --> 33:42.410
We'll talk later.

33:49.573 --> 33:52.041
Take a good look,
and if you recognize anybody...

33:52.213 --> 33:54.124
...tell me where you know him from.

34:00.133 --> 34:01.407
Number four.

34:01.573 --> 34:05.725
- Where do you recognize him from?
- He beat that kid with the baseball bat.

34:07.053 --> 34:09.408
SIMONE: Everyone but
number four can go.

34:09.572 --> 34:11.085
Everybody but number four.

34:11.253 --> 34:14.085
- They'll bring in the next group now.
- All right.

34:14.253 --> 34:19.532
- Say, aren't you Walter Hoyt, the artist?
- Yeah. Where do you know me from?

34:19.693 --> 34:23.322
I've seen you around the neighborhood
or a gallery opening or something.

34:23.493 --> 34:25.370
Yeah. I guess that could be.

34:25.533 --> 34:27.808
Come here, Palermo.

34:28.693 --> 34:30.922
MAN:
All right, next group, come on in.

34:34.612 --> 34:37.605
- You keep your mouth shut in there.
- Watch your tone of voice.

34:37.773 --> 34:39.445
You do not talk to that witness!

34:39.612 --> 34:41.524
I was being friendly.
I recognize the guy.

34:41.693 --> 34:44.810
You happen to be trying to send him
a message Pisciotta knows him.

34:44.973 --> 34:47.612
Do it again, you're gonna
recognize my fist in your smush.

34:47.813 --> 34:49.963
Now get back in there.

34:57.653 --> 34:59.848
- You ready, sir?
HO YT: Yeah.

35:04.653 --> 35:06.769
Anybody in this group you recognize?

35:06.933 --> 35:08.969
Yeah. I recognize number two.

35:09.173 --> 35:11.448
- Say from where.
HO YT: He drove up in the car...

35:11.613 --> 35:15.083
...jumped out, kicked the kid while
the other was beating him with the bat.

35:15.253 --> 35:17.972
- Everyone but number two can go.
- Everybody but number two.

35:18.173 --> 35:20.687
SIMONE: Will you put number two
in the cage with the other guy?

35:20.853 --> 35:22.844
I want to talk to them.

35:23.013 --> 35:24.685
MARTINEZ:
Come on, let's go.

35:24.973 --> 35:27.487
MAN: Come on, guys.
Right through here.

35:30.493 --> 35:33.132
- Am I through?
- Yeah. We're done for today.

35:33.733 --> 35:34.848
Let's go outside.

35:35.013 --> 35:37.652
They'll tell you
how the rest of this is gonna go.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.722
SIMONE: You okay?
- Yeah.

35:43.933 --> 35:48.006
You'll go before the grand jury, tell what
happened and how you made these IDs.

35:48.213 --> 35:51.683
The defendants aren't gonna be there.
Or this shyster, Palermo.

35:51.853 --> 35:54.321
It's just gonna be you,
the grand jury and the DA.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.127
Yeah, right.

35:57.373 --> 35:59.284
How about we put you
in a hotel till then?

35:59.453 --> 36:00.647
I'll go back to my place.

36:00.813 --> 36:02.724
What's the matter with
staying in a hotel?

36:02.893 --> 36:06.124
- I work in my place. I paint there.
SIMONE: Yeah...

36:07.413 --> 36:10.450
These guys work at the Ucilli,
which is Frank Pisciotta's place.

36:10.653 --> 36:11.972
He's a hooked-up guy.

36:12.133 --> 36:16.763
We'd be lying to you if we didn't tell
you that you could be in harm's way.

36:16.973 --> 36:19.123
You know, ID'ing these guys.

36:19.293 --> 36:22.490
What's gonna happen? They gonna
gun me down in the street?

36:22.653 --> 36:24.291
SIMONE:
Well, to tell the truth...

36:25.133 --> 36:28.364
...they'll probably try to reach out
with money first.

36:28.573 --> 36:31.883
- Try to get you to change your story.
- What if I don't?

36:32.053 --> 36:36.171
What you should do, Walter, is stay in a
hotel for a few days till the grand jury.

36:36.333 --> 36:38.608
SIMONE:
Then it's six months before the trial.

36:38.813 --> 36:41.771
You should think about relocating
to another part of the city.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.401
- I work in my loft.
SIPOWICZ: There's other lofts.

36:44.573 --> 36:49.089
It's just not a great idea you staying
there once the indictments come out.

36:54.973 --> 36:57.328
Maybe I can get something in Brooklyn.

36:58.733 --> 37:01.770
Yeah. Let's talk about it inside.

37:01.933 --> 37:03.730
SIPOWICZ:
I'll be right in.

37:08.133 --> 37:10.124
- Did you have a good chat?
- Yes. We're done.

37:10.293 --> 37:12.602
Before you go,
I want you to see our lavatory.

37:12.773 --> 37:16.812
- I don't need to see your lavatory.
- It's a wonderful, wonderful lavatory.

37:17.093 --> 37:19.084
Take a message, attorney Palermo.

37:20.573 --> 37:23.485
Tell Frank Pisciotta from me,
anything happens to Walter Hoyt...

37:23.653 --> 37:26.292
...that grease trap that he runs
is gonna be full of rats.

37:26.493 --> 37:30.168
It'll be boarded up and have Health
Department notices slapped all over it.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.807
- You through?
- He'll have State Liquor up his ass.

37:32.973 --> 37:36.204
He'll have the fire marshals one day,
the Building Department the next.

37:36.373 --> 37:39.365
He's gonna be paying so many fines,
all you'll get is IOUs.

37:39.533 --> 37:41.569
- Are you through now?
- Yeah, I'm through now.

37:41.733 --> 37:45.203
You tell that coked-out
son of a bitch what I said.

37:53.453 --> 37:57.207
- So Walter's decided to stay at a hotel.
- I think that's smart.

37:58.053 --> 38:01.329
I'm gonna make a quick call to the DA,
Walter. Get you set up.

38:06.453 --> 38:08.045
So...

38:09.333 --> 38:11.972
You a pretty good painter, Walter?

38:12.253 --> 38:13.891
I think I am.

38:14.613 --> 38:16.331
What kind of stuff you do?

38:17.333 --> 38:20.086
I'm redefining negative space...

38:20.373 --> 38:21.522
Uh-huh.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.328
...by imploding line.
- Uh-huh.

38:25.853 --> 38:27.923
SIMONE:
You're okayed, Walter.

38:28.093 --> 38:30.812
They just need to make
some notifications.

38:31.973 --> 38:33.486
Bobby.

38:35.693 --> 38:39.003
You mind if I don't take him to
the hotel? I'm meeting Sylvia for lunch.

38:39.213 --> 38:40.248
Yeah, no problem.

38:40.413 --> 38:44.201
- You break bad with that lawyer?
- For all the good it's gonna do.

38:47.093 --> 38:49.368
SIMONE:
All right, Walter. Let's take a ride.

38:53.813 --> 38:56.088
See you later, Walter.

39:01.133 --> 39:03.522
- Lieutenant?
FANCY: Yeah. What is it, Donna?

39:07.093 --> 39:09.561
Lieutenant, I've got
some vacation time on the books.

39:09.773 --> 39:12.367
And if it's all right,
I'd like to take some of it.

39:12.533 --> 39:15.093
Well, it's your time, Donna.
That's what it's there for.

39:15.253 --> 39:18.450
- When would you wanna go?
- I'd like to go immediately.

39:18.613 --> 39:20.569
I've got all the monthly reports
caught up.

39:20.773 --> 39:22.570
I checked with the chief of detectives.

39:22.733 --> 39:24.689
They've got replacements
in the temp pool.

39:24.853 --> 39:27.572
I don't want to intrude, Donna,
but is everything all right?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.769
Anything at the office
causing you a problem?

39:29.933 --> 39:32.242
No. I just need to get away.

39:33.373 --> 39:36.012
All right. Take care of yourself.

39:37.493 --> 39:39.563
- Thank you, lieutenant.
- Yeah.

39:46.333 --> 39:48.972
Detective, do you have a moment?

39:50.253 --> 39:52.369
Of course.

40:01.173 --> 40:03.733
I thought we could talk after work.

40:04.133 --> 40:08.331
I'm, uh, gonna take
some vacation time, Greg.

40:08.493 --> 40:11.610
- When?
- I'm leaving right away.

40:12.253 --> 40:13.242
Uh-huh.

40:13.413 --> 40:19.363
I'm not sure for how long. I haven't even
decided how I'm gonna spend the time.

40:20.493 --> 40:22.165
Sure.

40:22.653 --> 40:26.646
Well, there's no reason
you'd have to know.

40:26.813 --> 40:30.089
I just know I gotta get away.

40:30.293 --> 40:34.081
Um, I haven't fared well in all of this.

40:34.253 --> 40:37.404
I think that's a good idea,
Donna, you know...

40:37.573 --> 40:41.361
...just go away for an
undetermined length of time.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.449
I'm glad you understand.

40:45.773 --> 40:49.846
And if you don't have a destination...

40:50.493 --> 40:52.723
...you'll find one when you get there.

40:55.213 --> 40:57.124
Donna, whatever you do...

40:57.813 --> 40:59.849
...you know, wherever you go...

41:00.333 --> 41:02.051
...I want you to know...

41:02.693 --> 41:05.605
...I just want you to be happy.

41:06.373 --> 41:11.731
If that could be with me, I think
you know that's my preference.

41:13.413 --> 41:15.051
But I love you.

41:16.013 --> 41:18.402
And whatever makes you happy...

41:19.453 --> 41:22.365
...that's what I hope happens for you.

41:30.293 --> 41:32.249
I'll see you soon.

41:33.053 --> 41:35.123
Whenever.

41:51.013 --> 41:54.050
Hey, I saw you and her talking.

41:54.693 --> 41:56.809
- She's leaving.
- She's leaving?

41:56.973 --> 41:59.726
Yeah. She's gonna take
her vacation time.

41:59.893 --> 42:01.406
She wants to get away.

42:01.573 --> 42:04.565
Jeez, I thought with you
grabbing that guy out there...

42:04.773 --> 42:08.368
Yeah. Well, she's looking
at finding her bearings.

42:08.533 --> 42:12.811
She may find she wants to resume
with me or she may not.

42:13.253 --> 42:15.289
Uh-huh.

42:16.973 --> 42:21.205
Don't let me go out there, James.
I want to ask her not to leave.

42:21.893 --> 42:24.773
- But I know it's not the right thing to do.
- Yeah. Not if she wants some space.

42:24.773 --> 42:25.523
- But I know it's not the right thing to do.
- Yeah. Not if she wants some space.

42:25.693 --> 42:29.003
- I want to go and ask her to stay.
- You're right for not doing that.

42:29.973 --> 42:31.452
Would you do me a favor, James?

42:31.613 --> 42:34.002
Would you just look out there
and see if she's gone?

42:34.173 --> 42:35.731
Sure.

42:43.813 --> 42:46.202
Yeah, she's gone.
I guess she left for lunch.

42:46.413 --> 42:48.688
No, no. She's not coming back.

42:49.653 --> 42:53.566
She's uh...
She's left for her vacation.

42:54.893 --> 42:56.292
Yeah.

42:58.733 --> 43:00.963
Which is good.

43:06.693 --> 43:08.729
SIPOWICZ: How's it going?
- Okay. I'm hungry.

43:08.893 --> 43:11.282
That's good because
you didn't eat breakfast, either.

43:11.453 --> 43:12.727
How'd your lineup go?

43:12.893 --> 43:14.724
The witness stood up.
He picked the guys.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.009
COSTAS: Good.
- Could you hold up for just a second?

43:17.173 --> 43:20.483
We have an overflow
from Central Booking here.

43:26.413 --> 43:28.973
Did you go to that
rape treatment center?

43:29.133 --> 43:30.964
They were really helpful.

43:31.133 --> 43:33.647
One of my counselors
is still there from six years ago.

43:33.813 --> 43:36.202
So you didn't have to start
from scratch.

43:36.373 --> 43:38.728
I'm not gonna be able to skate through.

43:39.373 --> 43:42.445
- A lot of feelings will be coming back.
- Sure.

43:43.893 --> 43:47.044
She said there's a men's group too,
if you're interested.

43:47.853 --> 43:51.368
- You think I gotta do that?
- I think it might be good.

43:53.413 --> 43:56.644
It's not a perpetual thing, though, right?

43:56.813 --> 43:59.008
No. Not perpetual.

43:59.173 --> 44:01.687
Only as long as it's useful.

44:09.493 --> 44:12.291
Thanks for being here for me, Andy.

44:12.453 --> 44:14.728
Where else am I gonna be?

45:04.573 --> 45:05.562
