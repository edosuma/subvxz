previously on dark matter.

00:02.036 --> 00:03.769
[three]
who are you?

00:03.771 --> 00:05.604
[one] we all woke up
just like you.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.606
No idea who we are
or how we got here.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.376
[six] we're nothing but
a bunch of low life mercenaries.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.380
One of the dreams
she experienced was of one of u,

00:14.382 --> 00:16.348
Sabotaging the stasis pods.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.616
[weapon charging up]

00:17.618 --> 00:18.384
[six] what's inside?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.086
[five]
secrets.

00:20.087 --> 00:21.787
How do you think the rest
of the crew will react

00:21.789 --> 00:24.089
When they find out
that you're an impostor?

00:25.126 --> 00:28.761
[jace] who are you and what
the hell are you doing with my ?

00:34.135 --> 00:35.601
This is ridiculous.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.669
We're the most wanted
criminals in the galaxy

00:37.671 --> 00:40.606
And we can't even scrape togethr
enough money to buy a decent me.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.375
[six] well, we could if you
hadn't lost those weapons.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.577
We were ambushed.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.779
It wasn't our fault.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.047
So you keep saying.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.548
Alright, there's
no point in arguing.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.550
There's nothing we
can do about it now.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.652
Sure there is.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.753
We do what we do best... Rob so.

00:55.756 --> 00:59.658
[three chuckles]

00:59.660 --> 01:01.160
Anyone in particular?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.661
I say ferrous corp.

01:02.663 --> 01:06.331
We find their closest outpost,
and we just nail it... Hard.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.167
They're already
pissed off at us, right?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.668
How much worse could it be?

01:09.670 --> 01:10.669
What do you think?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.171
I think it's a terrible--

01:12.173 --> 01:15.674
[three coughing]

01:15.676 --> 01:18.110
Sorry, wrong pipe.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.845
You were saying?

01:21.682 --> 01:24.583
Sure, it's what we do, right?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.252
Yeah.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.822
What about the vault?

01:29.824 --> 01:31.857
What vault?

01:31.859 --> 01:33.392
I think that's what it is.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.127
It's down in the lower levels,

01:35.129 --> 01:37.396
At the end of
a maintenance shaft.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.299
I found it when i was
exploring the vents.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.474
[two] this is the door you
saw in your dream, isn't it?

01:48.476 --> 01:50.826
[five]
yeah.

01:50.827 --> 01:53.177
[six] well if i were a pirate a,
and apparently i am,

01:53.180 --> 01:56.515
This is the kind of place
i might just pick to hide my lo.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.383
[two] has anyone else
been down here before?

01:58.385 --> 02:01.186
[three] no, definitely not me.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.198
Alpha-numeric lock code.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.567
Which none of us
can remember.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.870
You ever dream
about the code, kid?

02:17.872 --> 02:20.306
No.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.741
But it's still rattling
around in your head isn't it?

02:22.743 --> 02:25.310
[one] what do you want to do,
crack her skull open?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.812
Dig around with a spoon?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.413
Believe me, if i thought
that would help--

02:28.415 --> 02:29.615
[five scoffs]

02:29.617 --> 02:31.250
[android] two, come in please.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.885
Go ahead.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.519
[android] i think you should all
come up to the bridge immediate.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.321
We're receiving a transmission.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.606
From who?

02:37.607 --> 02:38.890
Someone who says he knows you.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.444
[android] the signal's weak
this far from the nearest g-com.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.346
There may be some interference.

03:01.348 --> 03:05.117
[two]
okay.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.887
I should warn you: He seems to e
a man of little patience and ta.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.190
Ah.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.191
Portia lin et al.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.193
Thanks for keeping me waiting.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.195
Your android, a little testy, b,

03:16.197 --> 03:17.963
You might want
to check that out.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.798
[android confused]
i thought i was nothing but pat.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.867
Is there something
we can do for you?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.435
[man laughing]

03:23.437 --> 03:26.572
Is there something
they can-- you hear that?

03:26.574 --> 03:29.808
There was, definitely something
you could do for me, your job.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.577
The one i set up for you?

03:31.579 --> 03:32.762
With ferrous corp?

03:32.763 --> 03:33.946
The one you
completely messed up?

03:33.948 --> 03:36.215
This ringing any bells?!

03:36.217 --> 03:38.584
There were
unforeseen circumstances.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.452
[woman] babe, have
you seen my inhaler?

03:40.454 --> 03:41.987
No, i haven't
seen your inhaler!

03:41.989 --> 03:43.822
I'm on the phone!

03:43.824 --> 03:45.591
This is interstellar,
you have any idea

03:45.593 --> 03:46.858
How much this costing me!

03:46.860 --> 03:48.327
Get outta here!

03:50.631 --> 03:53.532
[man inhales]

03:53.534 --> 03:59.571
[man coughing]

03:59.573 --> 04:01.640
[man clears chest]

04:01.642 --> 04:04.343
Anyway, where were we?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.944
Oh right, you were talking about

04:05.946 --> 04:08.413
How you were gonna
make it up to me.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.248
Were we?

04:09.250 --> 04:10.633
I didn't think--

04:10.634 --> 04:12.017
Let me bottom line
this for you, okay?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.286
Ferrous wants your heads.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.288
Without their backing
you've got no political protect,

04:16.290 --> 04:18.790
Which, given your records,
i think we can all agree,

04:18.792 --> 04:20.359
Is not a good thing.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.127
But it's okay.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.894
I'm gonna take care of it,
i'm gonna smooth things over.

04:23.897 --> 04:24.997
And in exchange,
you're gonna do a job for me.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.698
What kind of job?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.966
Oh walk in the park.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.636
Salvage job, nothin' to it.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.305
Which is why you're gonna do it
for half of your normal rate.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.339
[three] no way.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.981
[android] it's a freighter,
iss far horizon.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.418
It apparently suffered some kind
of catastrophic system failure,

04:46.420 --> 04:50.355
The resulting explosion exposed
most of the upper decks to spac.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.624
None of the crew survived.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.660
Unfortunately, the data stream
provided by your friend

04:54.662 --> 04:56.895
Was a little short
on information.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.431
I don't think he's our friend.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.599
[six]
he's a handler.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.766
He gets the jobs, we do the job.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.320
Like an agent.

05:04.321 --> 05:06.872
[three] i don't know, guy
seems like a scumbag to me.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.775
What?

05:09.777 --> 05:12.678
I'm not allowed
to have standards?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.680
The thing i don't get is why us?

05:14.682 --> 05:17.883
Why not hire some licensed
salvage operation to do the job?

05:17.885 --> 05:20.686
[two] if i had to guess,
there's something illegal on th.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.622
Stolen goods,
drugs, who knows?

05:23.624 --> 05:24.890
Something valuable?

05:24.892 --> 05:26.391
Can we trust him?

05:26.393 --> 05:28.060
Well, we have worked
with him before--

05:28.062 --> 05:30.029
We need him.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.997
Without our memories,
we have no other connections.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.799
We're completely on our own.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.805
Am i wrong?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.645
[two] we're nine hours out from
the freighter's last known loca,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.580
So everyone get some sleep.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.922
[door slides open]

05:56.924 --> 05:58.824
Oh, h-hi.

05:58.826 --> 06:02.094
Um, i just came by
to see if you wanted to um...

06:02.096 --> 06:05.530
[three groans]

06:05.532 --> 06:07.766
Hey.

06:10.371 --> 06:15.674
If you wanted to go over
the plans, for the salvage.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.142
Oh, sure.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.679
Why don't we go up to the bridge
and we'll go over it.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.683
Are you coming?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.451
Yeah.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.395
[android] as far as we know,
the ship's ftl drive is intact,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.497
But navigation from
the bridge is impossible.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.066
If we can establish a remote lik
in the engineering section,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.835
I might be able to upload
a jump sequence from here.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.872
The ship will fly itself
to its original destination.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.608
[one] you do know the guns
are just a precaution, right?

06:49.610 --> 06:50.809
The ship's abandoned.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.949
There might be rats.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.785
I hate rats.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.690
[two]
android, come in.

07:05.692 --> 07:06.792

i'm reading you.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.692
Go ahead.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.561
[two]
we're in.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.429
Life support's operational, but.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.798
It's a little cold in here.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.066
[android] the ship is operating
on emergency power only,

07:15.068 --> 07:16.835
But i estimate at least six hous

07:16.837 --> 07:19.538
Before life support
shuts down completely.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.506
That should be more
than enough time.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.952
Understood.

07:22.953 --> 07:24.397
We'll head to engineering now.

07:24.398 --> 07:25.842
[three] i think we should
look around a little first.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.612
We came here to do a job.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.881
You said it yourself,
there might be some nice,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.850
Tasty contraband kicking
around here somewhere.

07:31.852 --> 07:32.851
Which they want back.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.152
That's why they hired us.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.821
Half the ship's exposed to spac.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.339
Who's gonna be surprised

07:37.340 --> 07:38.856
If there's a little
contraband that goes missing?

07:38.859 --> 07:43.195
Am i right, hmm?

07:43.197 --> 07:44.629
Yeah.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.764
Absolutely.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.866

07:47.868 --> 07:49.201
We're barely making a profit he.

07:49.203 --> 07:53.205
Maybe we should
at least take a look.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.707
[two]
alright, fine.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.208
I'll head down to engineering,
and hook up the link.

Well in the meantime,

09:09.883 --> 09:10.882
I highly doubt that.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.584
Despite your low center of grav,

09:12.586 --> 09:14.586
You possess neither
the strength nor the stamina

09:14.588 --> 09:17.022
To pull my body weight
over any significant distance.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.659
No, i mean could you
help me with something?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.161
Of course.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.662
I, on the other hand,
possess the strength

09:23.664 --> 09:26.865
And stamina to convey
you with great ease.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.933
No dragging required.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.568
Whoa.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.236
No i just need your help
with something in the infirmary.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.172
No heavy lifting.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.774
Okay.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.681
Where did you find this?

09:42.683 --> 09:47.819
It was in that storage room,
where i found the dead boy.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.021
Did you find anything else?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.123
No.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.192
I thought it was
just data storage,

09:54.194 --> 09:57.929
But i've tried everything,
i can't read it.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.900
I'm not surprised,
because it's not data storage.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.702
Then what is it?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.003
Curious.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.005
The molecular structure
is similar to that

10:07.007 --> 10:10.875
Of a subatomic matrix card,
but on a much smaller scale.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.911
What does that mean?

10:12.912 --> 10:14.946
If i had to guess,
i would say this is part

10:14.948 --> 10:16.281
Of some larger system
designed to

10:16.283 --> 10:19.050
Access pockets of
extra-dimensional space.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.990
Why would somebody
want to do that?

10:24.992 --> 10:28.093
I ask myself that
question all the time.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.895
Rarely do i get
a satisfactory answer.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.698

10:33.700 --> 10:36.801
Thanks anyways.

Do me a favor, don't tell any
of the others about this, okay?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.980
I thought you had
resolved to trust them.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.082

11:37.731 --> 11:40.765
I think the other side of
this wall is exposed to space.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.100
Could be pressure or
temperature difference

11:42.102 --> 11:43.968
Causing the metal to warp.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.838
Maybe this isn't such a good id.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.707

13:09.923 --> 13:11.890
Looks fresh.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.224

what're you talking about, six?

13:13.226 --> 13:16.060
How could that be?

13:16.062 --> 13:18.062
Answer me! Who's blood?

13:18.064 --> 13:19.831

most likely theirs.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.848
[six] we've got

13:38.451 --> 13:40.185
How did they die?

13:40.187 --> 13:42.220
I don't think it
was an accident.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.855
[four] it was
a violent attack.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.590
Not with
conventional weapons.

13:45.592 --> 13:49.961
Whoever did this used
their bare hands... And teeth.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.130
I-i'm sorry, did you say "teeth?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.832
Correct.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.133
Okay, that's it.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.835
Fall back to my position.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.470
We'll finish hooking up the link
and get the hell out of here.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.175
One and three, are you reading ?

14:05.445 --> 14:08.346
[one] we're getting a lot
of interference over the radio.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.149
Could be residual
radiation from the explosion.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.183
[three]
so?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.886
So i'm not a fan
of radiation.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.087
We should head back.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.189
Nah, not yet.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.290
This ship has yet
to give up it's riches.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.967
Do we have to have
this talk again?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.536
Remember that i am not
the one who had his face

14:31.538 --> 14:34.272
Surgically altered so that
he could infiltrate our crew.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.440
It doesn't prove anything.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.942
Maybe not.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.443
But it sure does make you
wonder though, doesn't it?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.912
How long are you gonna
hold this over me?

14:40.914 --> 14:42.347
I don't think that far ahead.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.215
Well just remember,
when you're blackmailing someon,

14:44.217 --> 14:47.252
You need to be really careful
not to push them too far.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.187

then do it.

It's be gonna
be hidden, right?

to be in plain sight.

you're not the real jace corso,

What the hell happened
between you and two?

pretty obvious, isn't it?

No but i totally would have.

No, in fact,
she came on to me.

At least he was
before he turned into that.

he's the only one.

through every scrap of data

19:30.670 --> 19:32.436

See if the infirmary
survived the explosion

19:34.207 --> 19:36.474
And tap into those logs.

In the meantime, we've gotta
get two back to the ship.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.748
Understood.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.316
[four]
we can't do that.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.317
You heard the recording.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.385
It's a contagion.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.386
She's been bitten.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.587
We don't know
anything for sure.

no, no.

thing that happened here

of a partial report.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.797
She said it was
a possible contagion,

19:59.799 --> 20:01.766
That might have been
transferred by contact.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.833
She said it was "likely."

20:02.835 --> 20:06.304
Whatever.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.605
Even if you are infected,

20:07.607 --> 20:09.607
Maybe there's something
we can do about it.

Maybe there's a treatment,
if we can catch it soon enough.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.212

compared to that one.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.796
The ship's infirmary is equipped
with an isolation chamber.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.265
It would be more than adequate
for quarantine purposes.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.601
And once you're inside,
we can scan for the presence

20:36.603 --> 20:38.603
Of any known viruses in
our medical database.

for symptoms to appear,

to know for sure.

for an answer.

21:04.530 --> 21:05.763

21:05.765 --> 21:07.531
With radio communications
on the freighter.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.300
There must be some
kind of interference.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.002
See if you can figure
out what's causing it.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.637
Understood.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.438
[four] there may
not be interference.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.440
It's possible they're not respog
because they were also attacked

21:16.442 --> 21:19.410
And are either dead
or incapacitated.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.479
That's what i like about you,

21:21.481 --> 21:23.581
Always looking on
the bright side.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.083
I'm realistic.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.584
Those two can
handle themselves.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.986
I'd be more worried about
them attacking each other.

21:28.988 --> 21:29.920

21:29.922 --> 21:32.056
Good point.

corridor look familiar?

We're going in circles.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.892
Don't be ridiculous.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.044
I have a very keen
sense of direction.

21:53.046 --> 21:55.046
And don't ask me
how i know that!

21:55.048 --> 21:56.781
This is great.

Excuse me?

22:08.428 --> 22:10.461
Yeah, you play all humble,

22:10.462 --> 22:12.495
But deep down you think
you're better than the rest of .

22:12.498 --> 22:14.765
You think we're scum bags,
and somehow you're different.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.467
Well, maybe not all of you.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.069
You're always going
on about the "team"

a planet called taurian alpha.

It was the site of
a pharmaceutical research facil,

28:41.854 --> 28:45.322
But it's now
under galactic quarantine.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.925
I'm guessing something
went wrong with the research.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.128
The trees on taurian alpha live
for tens of thousands of years.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.831
It was thought their
chemical structure could be used

28:53.833 --> 28:55.132
To synthesize a drug
that would effectively

28:55.134 --> 28:57.067
Make human beings immortal.

just gonna let that go.

abide by the quarantine.

to smuggle out whatever they ca,

again somewhere else.

get very far.

within three hours of exposure.

there's no cure.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.287
Maybe not for me.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.390
I thought i could make
things different, you know?

33:46.392 --> 33:47.657
Take a different path.

33:47.659 --> 33:52.362
Now it looks like
i might not get the chance.

33:52.364 --> 33:56.166
Do me a favor,
don't give up on the others.

34:14.586 --> 34:18.188
[one] hold on, i think
i got something here.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.790
[zombie wheezes]

34:19.792 --> 34:20.724
[three]
you sure?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.692
You see another way down?

34:22.694 --> 34:24.094
No.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.433
[one]
ugh.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.734
Slight problem.

34:30.736 --> 34:31.835
[three]
what?

34:31.837 --> 34:38.475
[zombies wheezing]

34:38.477 --> 34:40.310
Oh boy.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.812
How many?

34:41.814 --> 34:46.750
Seven or eight, they don't look
like they're doing too good.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.786
The lack of air must be
affecting them more than us.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.189
Well that's good.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.557
Easier for me to pick off.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.524
No!

34:54.526 --> 34:56.326
No more bullets.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.528
Let's remember what
happened last time.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.664
So what's your great idea?

35:00.666 --> 35:04.201
I say we just go down
there and walk right past them.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.402
For real?

35:05.404 --> 35:06.587
Yeah.

35:06.588 --> 35:07.771
If one of them
gives you any trouble,

35:07.773 --> 35:09.539
Just give 'em a swift kick.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.541
Look, they're dying
even faster than we are.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.677
Let's take advantage
of that while we still can.

35:13.679 --> 35:18.115
God, you better be right,
this better work.

35:22.387 --> 35:23.153
Alright.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.889
Shut'er down.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.657
[three sighs]

35:37.870 --> 35:40.203
Marauder, this is the raza.

35:40.205 --> 35:42.255
I did it.

35:42.256 --> 35:44.306
I managed to tap into the freigs
emergency life support.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.243
Restoring o2 levels now.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.546
Thank god.

35:53.485 --> 35:58.155
[zombies breathing heavily]

35:58.157 --> 35:59.890
What's that noise?

36:01.527 --> 36:04.227
Fresh air.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.329
Get back up here, now!

36:06.331 --> 36:07.597
Too late.

36:07.599 --> 36:16.406
[rapid shots firing]
bang, bang, bang

36:22.381 --> 36:24.581
You can come down now.

36:29.254 --> 36:34.691
[guns reload]

36:40.399 --> 36:42.699
So much for no bullets.

36:42.701 --> 36:46.970
It was only a few.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.905
You're welcome.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.275
Let's get going.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.985
[six] this is the marauder.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.787
I've got 'em. We're heading bac.

37:18.270 --> 37:18.969
[android]
he's clean as well.

37:18.971 --> 37:21.004
No sign of the virus.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.405
[three]
told 'ya.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.241
I didn't even get a scratch.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.609
Now let's go
finish this job?

37:25.611 --> 37:27.377
Hold on.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.580
How much time?

37:30.582 --> 37:34.651
I should start showing
symptoms any minute now.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.287
I'm sorry.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.022
If there was
anything i could've done...

37:43.762 --> 37:46.713
I know.

37:46.714 --> 37:49.665
But while you're still you, thes
one more thing we need to discu.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.001
What?

37:56.908 --> 38:00.377
This is a big mistake.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.945
Do it.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.291
You didn't really think
we were gonna let that thing

38:14.293 --> 38:16.526
Fly itself back to
civilization, did you?

38:16.528 --> 38:19.329
Well, i guess there's no way
we're getting paid now huh.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.498
Too bad.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.000
I'm just surprised because

38:24.002 --> 38:26.503
I thought that we
had an arrangement.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.574
You have something
you'd like to say?

38:37.883 --> 38:39.816
I think i'll save it for later.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.532
[one] how long
has it been?

38:55.534 --> 38:56.866
Over five hours.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.402
Shouldn't she have started
to show symptoms by now?

38:59.404 --> 39:01.604
Normally, yes.

39:01.606 --> 39:03.373
I say we scan her again.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.507
We already did that.

39:04.509 --> 39:05.542
Look at her.

39:05.544 --> 39:06.409
Nothing's happening.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.445
She's not changing.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.347
What do we have to lose?

39:24.863 --> 39:29.599
It's gone.

39:29.601 --> 39:30.567
That can't be.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.485
[two]
i knew it.

39:31.486 --> 39:32.402
I knew i wasn't changing.

39:32.404 --> 39:33.670
Let me out of here.

39:33.672 --> 39:34.504
I'm done.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.472
[one]
she's right.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.539
Let her out.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.841
[four] are you
sure that's wise?

39:37.843 --> 39:38.842
You saw the results.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.510
No virus detected.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.911
[six]
how is that possible?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.680
[android] according to
the far horizon's medical logs,

39:43.682 --> 39:45.949
No one has ever had
a successful immune response

39:45.951 --> 39:47.484
To the virus before.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.518
[four]
exactly.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.619
But that doesn't
change the fact

39:49.621 --> 39:51.554
That the virus is
no longer present.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.423
There is no threat.

39:59.564 --> 40:02.399
[one] look, guys, i can't explat
any better than you can.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.800
But what are we going do?

40:03.802 --> 40:06.102
Keep her in there forever?

40:26.691 --> 40:28.691
I don't suppose there's
any chance we can just

40:28.693 --> 40:31.027
Pretend like this never happene?

40:35.200 --> 40:36.633
Didn't think so.

40:57.622 --> 40:58.788
[beeping]

40:58.790 --> 40:59.889
Yup.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.959
[beeping]

41:05.697 --> 41:06.496
Hey.

41:06.498 --> 41:07.481
Hey.

41:07.482 --> 41:08.465
I hope i'm not
disturbing you.

41:08.467 --> 41:11.118
No, it's fine, what's up?

41:11.119 --> 41:13.770
Look, i wanted to say i'm sorry
about losing the freighter.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.206
But one was right,
it was just too dangerous.

41:16.208 --> 41:17.674
That's fine.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.876
It just would have been
nice to get a little cash

41:19.878 --> 41:21.778
In our pockets for once.

41:21.780 --> 41:25.949
Maybe get up
to something fun.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.953
You know... There are
other ways to have fun

41:29.955 --> 41:34.257
That don't cost anything.

41:34.259 --> 41:37.193
I am uh, i'm a little, tired.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.596
You know it's been a crazy day.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.501
Right.

41:44.503 --> 41:45.969
Next time.
