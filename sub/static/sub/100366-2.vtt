WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:01.964
The sun is not going to explode!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.645
There are no fireballs or meteorites.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.285
It is an invisible geomagnetic storm
that could disrupt things.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.685
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

00:09.720 --> 00:12.605
Stage one of a bad solar storm
would knock out satellites,

00:12.640 --> 00:16.045
potentially destabilising all transport
and navigation systems.

00:16.079 --> 00:18.423
Our daughter is in trouble, Robert!

00:18.508 --> 00:21.673
It's Georgia. They can't bring her
round, she's not breathing!

00:21.709 --> 00:23.093
I just don't have time for this.

00:23.287 --> 00:24.338
Anna?

00:25.123 --> 00:29.288
His sister was in Visegrad, not
a good place to be a young woman.

00:29.324 --> 00:32.244
He went to look for her,
and he just vanished.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.565
Jesus Christ!

00:36.600 --> 00:38.637
Air traffic control
are reporting a mayday

00:38.673 --> 00:40.450
from a diverted flight
from Malaga to Oslo.

00:40.486 --> 00:42.006
They think he's running on fumes.

00:44.356 --> 00:46.550
I'm afraid the news is not
what we were hoping for.

00:46.586 --> 00:50.192
We can expect a massive geomagnetic
storm surge in the coming hours.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.685
This is now a national emergency

00:52.720 --> 00:55.240
and COBRA will remain active
till its conclusion.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.885
This is your Local Resilience Forum.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.085
We are working to restore power,
but it may be some time.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.600
Emergency services
are operating at full capacity,

01:05.636 --> 01:07.964
so only dial 999 if it's a genuine...

01:08.000 --> 01:09.680
Unofficial reports have confirmed

01:09.716 --> 01:12.237
that four super-transformers
on the electricity grid

01:12.273 --> 01:13.201
have been burned out.

01:13.237 --> 01:16.281
Major cities, including London,
are also in chaos...

01:16.317 --> 01:17.746
The blackout has claimed
its first casualties,

01:17.782 --> 01:19.827
with two people killed in a collision
course by faulty traffic lights...

01:19.863 --> 01:23.462
The government has invoked
the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act,

01:23.748 --> 01:26.033
which allows it to limit
freedom of movement...

01:26.069 --> 01:27.486
Authorities say some of the blackouts

01:27.522 --> 01:29.047
are more serious than others.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.798
Four regions, North Wales,
East Scotland,

01:31.834 --> 01:33.631
Cornwall and Northumberland,

01:33.667 --> 01:36.207
have suffered major damage
to their infrastructure.

01:36.243 --> 01:37.964
- You OK, Fraser?
- Ah, yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.445
Just trying to get through
to my dad's care home,

01:40.480 --> 01:42.805
but their phone system must be wireless.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.445
He called me just before
the mobile masts went down.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.333
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

01:47.369 --> 01:49.591
He's just convinced
there's a plot against his dog.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.131
Good evening, everyone.

01:56.167 --> 01:58.295
Now, I have spoken to Her Majesty

01:58.720 --> 02:00.775
and informed her of the measures
I intend to take

02:00.811 --> 02:02.496
under the emergency legislation.

02:02.532 --> 02:04.724
These will include travel restrictions

02:04.760 --> 02:06.557
to and from the worst-affected areas,

02:06.593 --> 02:08.475
which I will use the army to enforce.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.205
I'm also enabling special tribunals
in the case of civil disorder.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.622
MI5 are monitoring the situation.

02:14.658 --> 02:16.765
I'll give the Home Secretary
a security briefing

02:16.800 --> 02:18.205
right after this COBRA.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.678
And there's no need
to adjust the terror threat yet.

02:20.878 --> 02:24.443
We've drawn-up a contingency plan
which you should all have.

02:24.479 --> 02:25.564
Fraser?

02:25.715 --> 02:26.760
OK.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.685
Right now, our biggest problem

02:28.720 --> 02:32.045
is that emergency staff
cannot get to their places of work

02:32.080 --> 02:34.383
and all the navigational systems
are out.

02:34.837 --> 02:36.877
The map shows the worst-affected areas,

02:36.913 --> 02:38.596
colour-coded according to severity.

02:38.632 --> 02:41.038
Why are the big conurbations
not showing,

02:41.074 --> 02:42.759
London, Birmingham, Manchester?

02:42.795 --> 02:44.520
Well, unlike the coastal nodes,

02:44.556 --> 02:47.161
we're hoping that most of
the major cities will be fixed

02:47.197 --> 02:48.435
within the next 48 hours.

02:48.760 --> 02:49.949
As for the rest...

02:49.985 --> 02:52.670
How long does
transformer replacement take?

02:52.913 --> 02:55.678
It depends, but in some cases
it can be a question of weeks.

02:55.714 --> 02:56.799
Weeks?!

02:56.989 --> 02:58.694
And those are the lucky ones.

02:58.906 --> 03:02.746
Four badly-hit areas,
but only three spare transformers.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.718
- Then...?
- Tough choices.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.520
One area is gonna be left behind.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.245
If anybody's gonna be
Puerto Rico here, it's Wales, right?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.125
I might remind the Home Secretary

03:16.160 --> 03:18.301
that I'm very proud
of my Welsh ancestry.

03:18.337 --> 03:20.605
I apologise to the Head of Intelligence

03:20.640 --> 03:23.840
for my poor attempt at gallows
humour at a difficult moment.

03:24.568 --> 03:26.688
Well, there's no doubt
of its difficulty.

03:27.773 --> 03:30.773
It could be months before we're
back on our feet, and even then...

03:31.680 --> 03:33.925
...the economic costs are incalculable.

03:34.635 --> 03:38.734
But, we can get through this
if we remain strong

03:39.200 --> 03:40.240
and stay together.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.405
My biggest concern right now
is keeping the hospital running

03:53.440 --> 03:55.167
so we can care for
the plane crash injuries.

03:55.203 --> 03:57.521
OK. Well, we've got a helicopter coming

03:57.557 --> 03:59.362
with blood and medical supplies.

03:59.398 --> 04:01.923
- We feel completely abandoned here.
- You're not.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.685
I'm coming with the supplies,

04:03.720 --> 04:05.695
and I'll see what it's like
on the ground there.

04:05.731 --> 04:07.576
I'll report directly back to the PM.

04:07.612 --> 04:08.637
OK.

04:08.836 --> 04:10.085
Thanks, Fraser.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.207
What's it like everywhere else?

04:12.600 --> 04:15.685
Well, in spite of the fears
of social meltdown,

04:15.720 --> 04:17.618
it sounds like most people
are out on the streets

04:17.654 --> 04:19.617
having a party and getting pissed.

04:19.653 --> 04:21.398
This proud island race.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.921
Oh, give it a few hours, some sore heads

04:23.957 --> 04:26.402
and the mood's likely
to change very quickly.

04:26.438 --> 04:28.125
We've also got trouble brewing

04:28.160 --> 04:30.633
at the new Hadley Brook
Immigration Removal Centre.

04:30.669 --> 04:33.745
Basically, everything's going wrong
here and I haven't got the staff,

04:33.781 --> 04:35.901
but we'll find a way.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.858
Hang on in there, Stuart,
and keep me posted.

04:39.831 --> 04:40.831
Will do.

Ellie's friend... is in a coma

04:55.680 --> 04:57.437
after they took drugs together.

04:58.760 --> 05:03.520
There will inevitably be questions
about the provenance of the drugs.

05:05.034 --> 05:07.753
- You need to be very careful.
- I know.

05:08.436 --> 05:10.201
Any suggestion that you were in any...

05:10.237 --> 05:11.357
I'm not stupid, Anna.

05:12.084 --> 05:13.844
Now, do you have transport home?

05:15.231 --> 05:18.116
Uh... I'm staying at Francine's,
it's just over the river.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.041
I think she's gonna say yes.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.325
Great!

05:21.360 --> 05:24.200
We can use Archie's rage
to reconnect Cornwall.

05:30.374 --> 05:31.414
Robert.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.983
Is Peter going to...

05:36.197 --> 05:38.042
Is Peter going to speak to Ellie?

05:38.078 --> 05:40.583
I haven't fully signed off
on Francine yet, by the way.

05:40.619 --> 05:42.764
Just remember,
you can't be seen to be...

05:42.800 --> 05:44.528
Didn't you notice I changed the subject?

05:44.564 --> 05:46.929
I did, that's why I changed it back.
Peter's awfully smart,

05:46.965 --> 05:48.689
but it's a moot point
whether he knows the difference

05:48.725 --> 05:50.410
between getting his ducks in a row

05:50.446 --> 05:52.824
- and perverting the course of justice.
- I heard you, Anna.

05:53.471 --> 05:56.038
Now, please, get out of here...

05:56.806 --> 05:58.511
..before I get cross with you.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.485
I'll be back in four hours.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.531
Make it six.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.680
Tired people make bad decisions.

07:59.494 --> 08:01.974
- Chief Constable Collier.
- Come through.

08:04.859 --> 08:05.884
Thank you.

08:10.826 --> 08:13.685
Over a third of our officers
failed to turn up for their shifts.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.725
The transport system's in total chaos.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.728
You're gonna have to bus in extra staff.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.729
All our resources are being directed,

08:19.765 --> 08:21.547
dealing with causalities
from the plane crash

08:21.583 --> 08:22.993
and trying to keep
the hospital functioning.

08:23.029 --> 08:25.012
Sir, they're piling up mattresses.

08:25.048 --> 08:27.504
You know what they're gonna do,
set fire to them,

08:27.540 --> 08:28.825
use them to start a riot.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.796
We can't control this.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.615
This place is a bomb waiting to go off.

08:35.803 --> 08:37.168
I need to get back.

08:37.719 --> 08:41.085
- So, you're just gonna leave us?
- You're not the only emergency, Hugh.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.471
This is an absolute clusterfuck!

08:43.506 --> 08:45.752
I hear you and I'm gonna talk to London

08:45.788 --> 08:47.687
and try and explain
what we're facing here, OK?

09:01.680 --> 09:03.000
Hey, come join us.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.485
Please come over.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.205
Come on!

09:24.120 --> 09:26.836
Look, mate, you should keep your
distance, look where you're going.

09:32.451 --> 09:35.832
So, what type of drugs
were involved, exactly?

09:35.920 --> 09:39.645
OK, so, coke, but we only had
a couple of grams between us.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.372
Oh, portion control, that's good

09:43.360 --> 09:45.440
And then we had the tea
to take the edge off.

09:47.068 --> 09:49.351
And that was made from
the fentanyl patches.

09:49.508 --> 09:51.793
And then I think Georgia
took a couple of benzos,

09:51.829 --> 09:53.687
- but they were hers.
- Just to stop you there, Ellie.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.483
I don't think it's sensible
to start dividing responsibility...

09:56.519 --> 09:58.724
- Well, the police are gonna ask her...
- Sure. Sure.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.565
So, we have a scenario where Georgia
supplied some of the drugs...

10:01.601 --> 10:03.633
No, I didn't say she supplied,
they were hers.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.402
And I suppose the point
is whether anything...

10:05.438 --> 10:06.760
The coke, the fentanyl,

10:06.796 --> 10:08.001
all the Class A stuff,

10:08.242 --> 10:09.282
who got hold of that?

10:13.064 --> 10:14.113
Right.

10:15.346 --> 10:19.771
So, what I'm saying here is that we
need to manage this very carefully,

10:19.807 --> 10:21.201
thinking about
the long-term repercussions...

10:21.237 --> 10:23.565
On what? On Georgia, or on Dad's career?

10:23.601 --> 10:26.082
- On everything.
- There is no long-term for Georgia.

10:26.118 --> 10:27.722
She's bloody braindead now,

10:27.758 --> 10:29.279
- thanks to your utter stupidity.
- Robert...

10:29.315 --> 10:31.332
All right, getting back to
the practicalities of an inquiry...

10:31.368 --> 10:32.490
I cannot take part in this conversation.

10:32.526 --> 10:33.787
I think you're absolutely
right, Prime Minister.

10:33.823 --> 10:35.019
You've had a lot on your plate.

10:35.055 --> 10:37.485
WSo, why don't you leave this to
Rachel and me to discuss with Ellie?

10:38.695 --> 10:41.375
You're OK to leave it with us
to sort out what's best for Ellie?

10:45.441 --> 10:48.014
I have to make a final decision
on those transformers.

10:59.085 --> 11:01.752
You have to say that Georgia
provided all the drugs.

11:01.788 --> 11:02.788
No way.

11:02.824 --> 11:05.137
- It's not going to affect her...
- It will affect her family,

11:05.173 --> 11:06.187
and it's not true.

11:06.223 --> 11:08.692
Do you want to spend
three years in prison?

11:10.323 --> 11:12.816
Your dad's right about one thing,
her life is effectively over.

11:12.852 --> 11:16.105
You do still have some control
over yours, though.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.360
All of these copied.

11:38.715 --> 11:41.000
So uh... what have we decided?

11:41.191 --> 11:43.455
- Uh... We haven't.
- Then, we must.

11:43.843 --> 11:45.461
So, we come back to the same issue,

11:45.934 --> 11:47.974
three transformers for four regions.

11:53.649 --> 11:56.702
All four crisis zones are gonna suffer,

11:57.486 --> 11:59.869
but one of them is gonna be
in a whole world of pain.

12:00.075 --> 12:01.360
And in terms of sourcing?

12:01.480 --> 12:03.456
Most Europeans countries
have replacements.

12:03.492 --> 12:05.657
We do have one on order
from KPG in Germany.

12:05.693 --> 12:06.769
How long?

12:07.095 --> 12:08.460
Hopefully within a week.

12:08.496 --> 12:10.966
In an ideal world, of course.

12:12.187 --> 12:13.733
Do we have a loser yet?

12:15.939 --> 12:18.164
I honestly think Scotland is a gimme,

12:18.200 --> 12:20.205
- and we can toss a coin for the...
- Toss a coin!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.900
It's a figure of speech, Robert!

12:22.263 --> 12:24.413
I'm just saying that
some people's lives will change,

12:24.449 --> 12:26.769
- whatever we decide.
- What do you think, Fraser?

12:30.410 --> 12:32.384
- I agree on Scotland.
- Hm.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.205
The plane crash factor does make
the transportation issue even harder

12:37.240 --> 12:38.560
with the A1 closed, so...

12:40.880 --> 12:42.381
Northumberland can wait.

12:42.835 --> 12:45.915
Get the rest on the road with
military protection immediately.

12:54.677 --> 12:57.209
You're not really one of us,
are you, Fraser?

12:57.245 --> 12:59.690
- No, I'm a civil servant.
- Uh-huh.

13:00.295 --> 13:02.336
But in your heart, you believe...

13:02.372 --> 13:03.617
In public service.

13:04.135 --> 13:07.518
But if it's any consolation,
my dad's one of your biggest fans

13:07.554 --> 13:08.815
and thinks you should
be leading the country.

13:08.851 --> 13:09.845
Ah!

13:09.881 --> 13:12.388
He's a mean-spirited old bastard
and a borderline racist

13:12.424 --> 13:14.549
with early-stage dementia.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.340
Good man!

13:16.375 --> 13:18.830
If only there were more like him,
I'd be choosing my cabinet.

13:19.415 --> 13:20.775
Keep it up, Fraser.

13:22.014 --> 13:24.099
Even if you do wear a secret red rose,

13:24.135 --> 13:25.735
you're doing an excellent job.

13:51.492 --> 13:53.897
No, the emergency generator
isn't working either.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.112
That's what he's trying to fix.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.268
OK. Yeah.

13:58.801 --> 14:00.366
Yeah. He's downstairs now.

14:00.750 --> 14:01.707
Hang on.

14:02.751 --> 14:05.708
- I'm looking for Edin Tosumbegovic.
- Oh, uh...

14:05.804 --> 14:07.204
Are you his partner? He said...

14:08.470 --> 14:09.875
Room 505.

14:10.135 --> 14:13.195
I would give you a key-card,
but... the doors are not working.

14:13.231 --> 14:14.351
Stairs are over there.

14:15.113 --> 14:16.153
Thank you.

14:25.676 --> 14:28.152
Fraser, got a message
from your father's care home,

14:28.188 --> 14:29.410
they'd like you to call urgently.

14:29.858 --> 14:32.574
I've been trying to get in touch.
How did they call?

14:32.610 --> 14:33.617
Landline.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.859
Must have got hold of
a non-cordless phone.

14:37.454 --> 14:38.554
Thanks.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.615
Hiya.

15:08.130 --> 15:09.130
Hi.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.284
Yeah, it's uh... Fraser Walker.

15:12.813 --> 15:14.807
Sorry about that.
The phones keep going down.

15:31.714 --> 15:33.568
Th-thanks... Thanks for letting me know.

15:34.661 --> 15:35.932
Yeah. Thank you.

16:38.474 --> 16:39.474
Anna?

17:05.594 --> 17:07.075
I have an hour.

17:12.345 --> 17:13.825
I never found Emina.

17:18.074 --> 17:20.498
She was seen at the Vilina Vlas Hotel.

17:22.655 --> 17:23.726
That's where the Chetniks...

17:23.762 --> 17:25.521
I know what happened to women there.

17:31.043 --> 17:33.283
Most of them were barely women.

17:36.045 --> 17:37.283
Now, it's a...

17:39.591 --> 17:40.911
...boutique hotel.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.499
Nobody cares
what once happened in those rooms.

17:50.345 --> 17:51.985
You think she was killed there?

17:56.588 --> 18:00.568
There's a witness who says she was
taken to the bridge over the Drina.

18:03.409 --> 18:05.195
Executed there and...

18:10.033 --> 18:11.433
..thrown into the river.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.136
Why didn't you contact me again?

18:21.172 --> 18:25.014
I went out of my mind.
Your parents would tell me nothing!

18:27.733 --> 18:29.993
I was captured just outside Visegrad.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.143
They sent me to a camp.

18:38.165 --> 18:39.205
Afterwards?

18:43.015 --> 18:46.575
It took me a little time
to... recover from that experience.

18:50.473 --> 18:53.973
When I was better, I went home,
to take care of my parents.

18:54.948 --> 18:56.228
And met somebody else.

18:59.869 --> 19:01.589
It wasn't as easy as that.

19:04.817 --> 19:09.297
My parents had lost their daughter
in... terrible circumstances.

19:11.705 --> 19:14.145
So, you married a Muslim girl
to please them?

19:15.473 --> 19:17.562
I couldn't let them lose a son, as well.

19:18.275 --> 19:20.635
I couldn't break their hearts
all over again.

19:24.712 --> 19:26.156
So, you broke mine.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.498
It wasn't a...

19:53.739 --> 19:55.539
...particularly happy marriage.

19:59.185 --> 20:00.890
I don't think I made her very happy.

20:00.926 --> 20:02.408
And where is she now?

20:06.497 --> 20:08.617
She died a little over a year ago.

20:18.954 --> 20:20.754
My God, look, look at the sky.

20:22.767 --> 20:24.541
Aurora borealis.

20:26.239 --> 20:27.386
In London!

20:30.075 --> 20:31.355
It's the solar storm.

21:22.558 --> 21:24.643
The number of passengers confirmed dead

21:24.679 --> 21:29.330
from the Amara Airlines Flight LM36
from Malaga has risen to 42.

21:29.366 --> 21:31.211
Due to ongoing transport problems

21:31.247 --> 21:33.216
affecting the A1 following that crash,

21:33.252 --> 21:36.177
many victims' families
still can't reach their loved ones.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.215
Use the RAF to bring
the victims' families up.

21:39.093 --> 21:40.218
...hospital near Hexham.

21:40.254 --> 21:42.739
Authorities are still struggling
to put a figure

21:42.775 --> 21:45.743
on the number of fatalities
caused by the nationwide blackout,

21:45.779 --> 21:49.159
but current estimates put the number
between 10 and 15.

21:49.195 --> 21:50.139
Excuse me, sir.

21:50.175 --> 21:53.093
While air crash investigators are yet
to publish their official verdict,

21:53.129 --> 21:55.814
the Amara Airlines crash
is believed to have been caused

21:55.850 --> 21:58.068
by the solar storm's effect on avionics.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.973
I just got word from the hospital.

22:06.971 --> 22:08.256
A little while ago,

22:08.695 --> 22:11.855
Georgia's parents agreed to
switch off her life-support machine.

22:14.665 --> 22:16.350
She's died.

22:16.386 --> 22:18.537
Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

22:23.055 --> 22:25.375
Oh, I'm so sorry.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.521
Listen, El...

22:33.546 --> 22:37.686
...I'm your father, darling,
and I love you very much.

22:39.034 --> 22:41.514
I know you would never
intentionally hurt anyone.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.154
Georgia made her own choices.

22:46.148 --> 22:47.856
Her poor parents.

22:52.465 --> 22:55.025
It's a terrible decision
for any parent to make.

22:57.623 --> 22:59.583
But it's time for you to move on now.

23:02.493 --> 23:04.090
This will pass, OK?

23:08.227 --> 23:09.307
This will pass.

23:18.180 --> 23:19.985
So, she died.

23:20.147 --> 23:22.507
They switched off
the life-support machine.

23:24.546 --> 23:28.471
Takes some of the pressure off their
emergency generators, I suppose.

23:28.807 --> 23:32.295
Even by your standards,
that is remarkably callous.

23:32.331 --> 23:35.370
I'm not terribly sympathetic
to posh druggies.

23:35.690 --> 23:39.966
Normally, there would be an absolute
shitstorm on the front pages.

23:40.002 --> 23:43.327
Yeah. Not a bad time
to bury a potential scandal.

23:43.832 --> 23:46.397
He must be hoping
it will all just go away.

23:46.433 --> 23:47.438
Hm!

23:47.790 --> 23:50.022
What is your interest here?

23:51.073 --> 23:52.846
I am a Russian mole,

23:52.882 --> 23:55.767
seeking to engineer
the prime minister's resignation

23:55.803 --> 23:58.768
and install puppets
at every level of government.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.644
- But really?
- Oh, really?

24:02.226 --> 24:03.984
I only ever have one interest.

24:04.655 --> 24:06.171
Our national security.

24:31.090 --> 24:32.255
Thank you.

24:32.291 --> 24:33.416
Stuart.

24:33.974 --> 24:36.139
It is complete chaos here!

24:36.175 --> 24:38.480
Please tell me it isn't going on
for much longer.

24:38.516 --> 24:40.583
I need to get back
for the return flight to London.

24:44.695 --> 24:46.764
Do not abuse the staff!

24:47.215 --> 24:51.849
We are trying to deal with
an extremely difficult situation.

24:51.885 --> 24:55.242
We will attempt to speak to you
as soon as we possibly can.

24:55.931 --> 24:57.936
Please, try and stay calm.

24:57.972 --> 24:59.857
- You see what I'm talking about?
- Yeah.

24:59.893 --> 25:01.958
The situation is getting worse here,
minute-by-minute.

25:01.994 --> 25:03.239
Sorry, just a second.

25:05.482 --> 25:08.407
Do not try and charge devices
from our power supply.

25:08.658 --> 25:11.623
We are operating
with emergency generators.

25:12.134 --> 25:13.939
Right, get back to them

25:13.975 --> 25:15.642
and tell them we'll get over there
as soon as we can.

25:15.899 --> 25:17.812
There's trouble
at the new detention centre.

25:17.848 --> 25:19.251
I have to get down there
and take a look.

25:19.287 --> 25:21.794
I'll ride shotgun if you can
get me back here in an hour.

25:22.817 --> 25:24.891
OK, let's go. This way.

25:28.112 --> 25:29.632
The end of the world!

25:31.570 --> 25:33.998
I've not been unfaithful
to my husband in all our marriage.

25:34.503 --> 25:35.748
It wasn't...

25:36.100 --> 25:37.060
I didn't...

25:37.630 --> 25:38.562
...plan this.

25:38.598 --> 25:41.102
You didn't purposefully
arrange the Northern Lights?

25:41.138 --> 25:43.496
Oh, yeah, that, I did, but...

25:43.948 --> 25:44.948
No.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.062
Has he been unfaithful to you?

25:58.493 --> 25:59.573
Probably.

26:00.836 --> 26:01.916
Don't ask.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.000
It's not a trade-off.

26:10.004 --> 26:11.204
Do you feel bad?

26:14.918 --> 26:16.322
Not now.

26:18.939 --> 26:20.219
Are you happy together?

26:25.200 --> 26:27.352
- Happy?
- Mm.

26:34.715 --> 26:36.988
I'm gonna go check the basement,
it's taking too long.

26:37.024 --> 26:38.024
OK.

26:53.939 --> 26:55.939
- How's it going?
- Yeah, I think we're OK.

27:04.193 --> 27:06.118
What if someone recognises me?

27:06.154 --> 27:08.639
Live a little dangerously,
hide behind me.

27:12.285 --> 27:14.650
For God's sake!

27:22.773 --> 27:24.898
No! Help! Help!

27:24.934 --> 27:26.054
Help!

27:41.335 --> 27:42.455
Help me!

27:43.969 --> 27:44.969
Help!

27:45.468 --> 27:46.508
Edin.

27:48.518 --> 27:49.478
Help!

27:50.665 --> 27:52.705
Help! Help! Somebody help!

27:53.384 --> 27:55.443
- Help!
- God. What happened?

27:55.748 --> 27:58.585
The generator,
it just... it just exploded.

27:58.625 --> 28:00.950
Hey, easy.

28:00.986 --> 28:03.111
- It just exploded.
- God, your hand.

28:03.147 --> 28:05.832
- We need to get water on these.
- I have to clear out the hotel.

28:05.922 --> 28:07.607
I have to clear the hotel.

28:07.985 --> 28:10.270
No! I have to clear the hotel.

28:10.306 --> 28:11.551
Go!

28:11.587 --> 28:12.627
Water, Anna!

28:17.237 --> 28:18.197
He's dead.

28:18.670 --> 28:19.750
He's dead.

28:21.122 --> 28:22.442
Quick, we need to go.

28:34.871 --> 28:35.951
Get out.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.401
So, how will they get
the replacement transformer

28:39.437 --> 28:40.962
through the site of the plane crash?

28:40.998 --> 28:42.860
There is no replacement transformer.

28:42.896 --> 28:44.767
- Not yet, anyway.
- Wait.

28:45.167 --> 28:46.680
It could take weeks to get installed,

28:46.716 --> 28:47.892
but there isn't even one on the way?

28:47.928 --> 28:49.743
There are only three spares
for four regions,

28:49.779 --> 28:52.104
- we had to make some tough decisions.
- Fuck me!

28:53.182 --> 28:55.761
- They're exploring all the options.
- You better bring guns next time,

28:55.797 --> 28:57.451
because this is one night without power,

28:57.487 --> 28:59.027
what's it gonna be like in a week?

29:06.384 --> 29:07.802
This doesn't look good.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.591
Some of the prisoners
must have got out and nicked a car.

29:10.948 --> 29:12.068
I'll get out.

29:12.733 --> 29:14.333
Be quick, and careful!

29:23.883 --> 29:25.003
Hurry up!

29:27.809 --> 29:28.889
Right, go.

29:30.510 --> 29:31.859
Who are these people?

29:32.190 --> 29:34.077
They look like asylum seekers.

29:34.329 --> 29:35.894
I'm not so bothered about them,

29:35.930 --> 29:39.255
but there's also high-security
criminals awaiting deportation.

29:39.405 --> 29:41.673
And if any of those bastards get out,

29:42.152 --> 29:44.069
it's a completely different story.

30:03.304 --> 30:05.457
I have to go in and see
if they're all right in there.

30:06.615 --> 30:09.342
- What do you want to do?
- I'm coming with you, of course.

30:09.378 --> 30:10.378
Are you sure?

30:34.891 --> 30:37.056
Fire! Fire!

30:37.092 --> 30:38.777
- Fire!
- Get out of the hotel!

30:38.813 --> 30:40.018
- Get out!
- Get out!

30:40.054 --> 30:44.219
- Get out of the building! Fire!
- Fire!

30:44.415 --> 30:45.615
Is anyone in there?

30:47.350 --> 30:49.437
- Get out of the hotel, there's a fire.
- Fire!

30:49.517 --> 30:50.597
Fire!

30:52.542 --> 30:54.307
Come on. Come on, this way.

31:23.230 --> 31:24.355
Hugh?

31:24.853 --> 31:27.024
Hugh! Where is everyone?

31:27.239 --> 31:30.279
They all ran away
when the office was stormed.

31:30.885 --> 31:32.010
It was chaos.

31:32.046 --> 31:33.828
The prisoners in the main blocks
all broke out.

31:34.316 --> 31:35.582
I've been stabbed.

31:37.373 --> 31:38.438
Don't worry.

31:38.887 --> 31:40.603
We'll get you to the hospital.

31:40.639 --> 31:41.867
Fraser, give me a hand.

31:46.809 --> 31:47.974
Shit!

31:48.010 --> 31:49.752
The high-security
prisoners are getting out.

31:49.788 --> 31:50.835
Christ!

31:51.554 --> 31:52.679
Fraser, come on!

31:52.777 --> 31:54.839
We have to get him out of here,
or they'll finish him off!

31:54.875 --> 31:57.055
Hey! Hey!

31:57.880 --> 32:00.347
Fire's everywhere! Come on, this way!

32:01.903 --> 32:04.873
Help! Help!

32:05.055 --> 32:06.540
Get out of here. Go!

32:06.575 --> 32:08.316
I can't open the door!

32:08.574 --> 32:09.574
Hey!

32:19.420 --> 32:20.505
Come on.

32:20.541 --> 32:21.586
It's this way.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.532
Help!

32:35.040 --> 32:36.365
Get away from the door!

32:36.401 --> 32:38.854
- I am!
- Go to the back of the room!

32:40.412 --> 32:42.252
- Are you away from the door?
- Yes!

32:46.367 --> 32:47.532
Edin?

32:47.867 --> 32:49.832
- Come on!
- Where... Edin?!

32:49.868 --> 32:51.193
Come on!

32:51.229 --> 32:53.554
- Edin!
- Come on!

32:53.590 --> 32:55.355
- We have to leave!
- Edin!

32:55.391 --> 32:56.475
We can't stay here.

32:56.511 --> 32:58.296
The smoke is getting thicker!

32:58.332 --> 32:59.617
Come on, come on.

32:59.653 --> 33:00.757
Go, go, go!

33:00.793 --> 33:01.833
Come on!

33:03.287 --> 33:04.452
Hurry up.

33:04.710 --> 33:05.955
You're all right.

33:05.991 --> 33:07.575
Let's get him in the back.

33:09.978 --> 33:10.978
Oi! Oi!

33:12.318 --> 33:13.483
Get back! Back!

33:13.519 --> 33:15.884
Stay back, mate!
I'm telling you, stay back!

33:15.920 --> 33:16.965
Get back!

33:17.001 --> 33:18.366
Stay back, I'm telling you!

33:23.273 --> 33:24.878
- Go!
- Quick.

33:24.914 --> 33:25.954
Go!

33:33.079 --> 33:34.079
Go! Go!

33:36.162 --> 33:37.247
Shit!

33:37.283 --> 33:38.443
Right, hold on.

33:43.097 --> 33:44.137
Jesus!

33:47.329 --> 33:48.454
Hit the brakes!

33:48.490 --> 33:49.530
I'm trying!

33:50.815 --> 33:52.540
- Right, hold on!
- Hit the brakes!

33:59.423 --> 34:00.468
Come on!

34:01.253 --> 34:02.413
Come on, move!

34:04.034 --> 34:05.199
We need to get out.

34:16.206 --> 34:17.478
We need to get out. Come on.

34:20.317 --> 34:22.556
Anna? Anna!

34:24.308 --> 34:25.469
Are you all right?

34:25.911 --> 34:28.277
- Are you OK?
- I can't... I can't breathe.

34:28.393 --> 34:29.641
Take her.

34:30.547 --> 34:31.712
Come on.

34:34.679 --> 34:38.005
- Are you OK?
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

34:38.041 --> 34:40.045
You need to get up. Come on!

34:40.081 --> 34:41.127
Come on.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.859
I've got you. I've got you.

34:44.187 --> 34:45.706
Come on! Come on.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.159
We've gotta... gotta move. Come on!

34:58.296 --> 34:59.249
Come on!

35:01.936 --> 35:03.016
Help!

35:03.836 --> 35:06.225
- Come to me.
- Help!

35:08.702 --> 35:09.862
Here you are now.

35:12.293 --> 35:14.173
That's it, that's it. I've got you.

35:14.209 --> 35:15.209
Lie on me.

35:40.384 --> 35:43.749
Well, I bet that wasn't covered
on the civil service entrance exams.

35:45.221 --> 35:47.741
That's the last time
anyone calls me a pen pusher!

35:55.271 --> 35:56.911
My dad died tonight.

36:00.278 --> 36:01.398
He was in a care home.

36:02.734 --> 36:06.383
He tried to move when a power cut
hit and fell down the stairs.

36:14.965 --> 36:16.605
I'm very sorry to hear that.

36:17.536 --> 36:20.316
I made a nasty joke about him
before he died.

36:25.336 --> 36:28.281
I make nasty jokes about my family
all the time.

36:28.317 --> 36:29.917
It doesn't mean I don't love them.

36:35.002 --> 36:37.399
Well, I gotta get back to London.

36:41.322 --> 36:42.955
Don't forget us, OK?

36:44.740 --> 36:47.265
I promise you I'll do
everything in my power

36:47.379 --> 36:48.859
to help you get through this.

37:10.719 --> 37:11.759
Robert.

37:14.035 --> 37:15.115
Robert.

37:17.886 --> 37:18.906
Robert.

37:22.134 --> 37:23.174
Come to bed.

37:26.128 --> 37:28.083
I can't. Not yet.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.677
I must phone Georgia's parents.

37:34.438 --> 37:36.118
Give them our condolences.

37:37.699 --> 37:40.864
I can't let Ellie face
the possibility of prison, Robert.

37:40.900 --> 37:42.486
I know, I know.

37:44.039 --> 37:47.439
I'm the lawyer, leave it to me
and Peter, we will get through this.

37:55.281 --> 37:56.486
What is it?

37:57.209 --> 38:00.114
The voltage instability issue
has been rectified.

38:01.842 --> 38:04.367
Power will soon be restored
to the major cities.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.200
But the rest of the country...?

38:06.994 --> 38:10.575
Certain places won't be able to
turn a light on for quite some time.

38:14.712 --> 38:16.792
Pff! Sorry I woke you.

38:21.774 --> 38:23.163
I'm glad it was you.

39:21.187 --> 39:22.352
Hey.

39:23.917 --> 39:24.957
Hey.

39:25.747 --> 39:26.907
Hey.

40:02.973 --> 40:04.653
If you need me, I'll be over there.

40:14.191 --> 40:16.211
Oh, come on! Now's not the ti...

40:18.821 --> 40:21.061
- Oh, God, I think he recognised me.
- No.

40:27.324 --> 40:29.941
10-45 to Gold Commander.
Receiving? Over.

40:33.876 --> 40:35.401
Gold Commander receiving.

40:35.437 --> 40:38.183
Some very distressed kids have
just walked in from the university.

40:38.219 --> 40:41.438
- You need to hear this, sir.
- OK, I'm on my way.

40:43.465 --> 40:44.585
I have to go.

40:45.789 --> 40:46.989
Will I see you again?

40:50.629 --> 40:52.269
You said you were going home.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.680
Do you want me to?

41:21.284 --> 41:22.988
The police have arrived
to talk to Ellie.

41:24.548 --> 41:25.588
Already?

41:26.825 --> 41:28.238
You'd think they had
better things to do.

41:28.274 --> 41:29.703
Given the circumstances they need to...

41:29.739 --> 41:31.896
I understand
the bloody circumstances, Peter.

41:31.932 --> 41:34.497
You're telling my daughter
it's OK to lie to the police.

41:35.455 --> 41:37.633
With all due respect, I think you
might need to talk to your wife

41:37.669 --> 41:39.136
about that side of things,
Prime Minister.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.263
There is something else.

41:48.935 --> 41:50.380
A situation has developed

41:50.415 --> 41:53.678
at the university next to the Hadley
Brook Immigration Removal Centre.

41:54.488 --> 41:55.980
Reports are very confused,

41:56.015 --> 41:58.071
but it seems a group of the escapees
have got in there

41:58.107 --> 41:59.689
and started to attack the students.

42:00.289 --> 42:01.369
Oh, God.

42:08.705 --> 42:10.426
- Is Anna back yet?
- I'm not sure.

42:10.462 --> 42:11.542
I need Anna for this.
