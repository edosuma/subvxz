00:44.340 --> 00:46.411
I told you to
keep an eye on her!

00:46.444 --> 00:50.017
I was. It came on so suddenly.

00:58.564 --> 01:00.099
Get some towels
and another pillow.

01:13.953 --> 01:15.456
There may still be a chance.

01:15.489 --> 01:18.027
Get her ready.

01:32.147 --> 01:33.418
She's the last one.

01:57.187 --> 02:01.094
Where's my baby?

02:01.127 --> 02:02.296
Where's my baby?

02:03.696 --> 02:05.132
I'm sorry, Mrs. Slater.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.507
No.

02:10.541 --> 02:12.344
No!

02:12.376 --> 02:18.687
No!

04:40.873 --> 04:50.388
Does anybody have a hairbrush?
I can't find it anywhere!

04:50.421 --> 04:53.661
I just hope there are enough
bags to carry all this.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.432
Well, we moved it on
here in the same bags, Mom.

05:01.471 --> 05:03.775
Does anyone ever
clean that pool?

05:03.808 --> 05:05.311
Hardly.

05:05.345 --> 05:08.450
Mrs. Slater says she's not paying
anyone to clean it if we never use it.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.786
How are we supposed to use it
if it's always dirty?

05:10.819 --> 05:13.558
Yeah. It sounds like
Mrs. Slater, all right.

05:13.591 --> 05:15.227
Well, we've just had the
pool man over,

05:15.259 --> 05:17.329
so you can swim all summer
while you're at home.

05:20.601 --> 05:24.373
I'm not moving back home, Mom.

05:24.406 --> 05:25.876
This has nothing
to do with you.

05:26.645 --> 05:29.416
I just have a lot
to think about.

05:29.449 --> 05:32.220
Like what I'm going to do
with the rest of my life.

05:32.254 --> 05:35.911
Well, don't you think
after four years of college

05:35.912 --> 05:38.763
you'd have a start
in those decisions?

05:38.796 --> 05:40.765
Katie, stop packing!

05:40.799 --> 05:43.271
Hi, Mrs. Rose,
how you doing?

05:43.303 --> 05:47.943
Katie, come here a second.

05:47.976 --> 05:51.250
I just want you to stay till
Friday to help set things up.

05:51.283 --> 05:52.452
How about it?

05:54.353 --> 05:57.927
By Friday, we're going to have
this place looking outrageous!

05:57.960 --> 05:59.663
Come on, yes or no?

06:00.296 --> 06:04.736
All six of us are staying.

06:04.769 --> 06:05.838
Ok.

06:05.871 --> 06:07.474
Great!

06:07.507 --> 06:10.545
By the way, don't worry
about a date for Friday night.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.416
-I went ahead and fixed you up!
-You what?

06:12.449 --> 06:15.654
No need to
thank me! Ciao!

06:48.938 --> 06:52.544
Yes?

06:52.577 --> 06:59.922
Thank you. You can send
her right in.

06:59.956 --> 07:01.726
They're just
asking for talks.

07:01.758 --> 07:02.992
You've got to reconsider.

07:03.026 --> 07:04.663
My mind
is made up.

07:04.696 --> 07:07.368
I intend to spend this summer as
I've spent all the rest.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.636
But the environment
here is so much more helpful.

07:09.670 --> 07:12.074
I told you,
there'll be no one at the house.

07:12.106 --> 07:14.411
It was closed for
three months today.

07:14.445 --> 07:16.515
I understand, but
anything might happen.

07:16.547 --> 07:23.625
At least here, we're
prepared to handle it.

07:23.659 --> 07:27.031
His condition is getting worse.
You know it as well as I do.

07:27.063 --> 07:28.900
We both knew the risks.

07:28.934 --> 07:33.541
For 20 years, you've been
blaming me for what happened.

07:33.573 --> 07:34.842
Don't you see?

07:34.876 --> 07:36.780
You're living in
a fantasy world.

07:36.813 --> 07:38.648
You've got to
forget the past.

07:38.681 --> 07:40.952
Live with what
you have today.

07:40.985 --> 07:43.490
You have done a good
job of forgetting.

07:43.523 --> 07:45.394
Well, I never will.

07:46.627 --> 07:49.065
If you try to stop me from
living as I please,

07:49.098 --> 07:51.635
I'll see that what you
did is remembered.

07:56.075 --> 07:59.548
I've had a
new tag made.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.151
This must be worn
at all times,

08:02.185 --> 08:05.022
just in case there
are any problems.

08:05.756 --> 08:07.693
There'll be no problems.

08:07.726 --> 08:08.995
Good day.

08:25.554 --> 08:27.056
Vicki, where
you taking me?

08:27.090 --> 08:35.837
Just wait.

08:35.870 --> 08:38.073
Holy shit, look
at this place.

08:38.107 --> 08:40.611
Is it deserted
enough for ya?

08:40.644 --> 08:41.812
Come on, let me try it.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.853
Do like I told you,
though, all right?

08:46.887 --> 08:48.990
Yeah, yeah,
I will, I will.

08:49.023 --> 08:51.060
Aim it at that
sack over there.

08:51.093 --> 08:54.165
Ok.

08:56.936 --> 09:00.008
Will you get off me?

09:00.041 --> 09:05.116
Go on, pull the trigger. Just...

09:22.041 --> 09:23.042
All right, all right.

09:23.076 --> 09:25.581
Come on, come on up front,
I'll start this time.

09:25.614 --> 09:29.086
-Ok.
-A toast to law school.

09:29.118 --> 09:33.693
May it be the three shortest
years of my life.

09:33.726 --> 09:35.630
I hope so!

09:35.663 --> 09:36.832
Ok, ok.

09:37.766 --> 09:40.370
Here is to reaching
my fullest capacity.

09:40.403 --> 09:42.206
Bout a quart and a half!

09:44.976 --> 09:48.315
Here's to Pan Am,
my new employer.

09:48.348 --> 09:51.654
May they never find out
I'm scared of flying!

09:54.625 --> 09:55.918
To my mother,

09:55.919 --> 09:59.800
who never let me forget I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

09:59.832 --> 10:04.273
Mama, you were wrong...
It's up my nose!

10:23.170 --> 10:25.873
Come on, Katie.

10:25.907 --> 10:27.143
Ok.

10:27.176 --> 10:29.446
I wanna thank you all.

10:29.478 --> 10:30.981
Noo, no

10:31.247 --> 10:32.483
No, I'm serious.

10:32.517 --> 10:38.460
I wanna thank you all for
helping me become what I am today.

10:38.492 --> 10:40.228
Wasted!

10:45.070 --> 10:51.246
Morgan, it's your turn.

10:51.278 --> 10:56.220
We realize this takes a
lot of thinking, Morgan.

10:56.254 --> 10:57.990
Ok.

10:58.022 --> 11:02.429
A toast to... to...

11:05.801 --> 11:09.006
God, I'm... excuse me!

11:10.408 --> 11:12.880
God!

11:12.913 --> 11:15.117
What are you girls doing here?

11:16.151 --> 11:17.387
Who, us?

11:17.420 --> 11:19.257
The house is closed.

11:19.289 --> 11:21.326
What are you girls doing here?

11:21.360 --> 11:23.497
Well...

11:23.530 --> 11:25.031
You tell her, Diane.

11:25.065 --> 11:27.302
It's all very
simple, Mrs. Slater.

11:27.335 --> 11:30.875
We had to move the graduation
party from the Silver Bear.

11:30.908 --> 11:32.244
Move it?

11:32.276 --> 11:35.281
Insufficient funds.

11:35.314 --> 11:36.917
So, we...

11:36.950 --> 11:39.955
We're having the party here.

11:39.987 --> 11:40.588
Really?

11:40.589 --> 11:42.391
We're only staying a
couple of extra days

11:42.425 --> 11:43.828
to set it up.

11:43.860 --> 11:46.999
And whose idea was all this?

11:47.033 --> 11:51.439
Well, Vicki thought the house would be
the perfect place, and we all agreed.

11:51.472 --> 11:53.209
Vicki.

11:53.242 --> 11:54.979
Where is she?

11:55.177 --> 11:58.049
We haven't seen her.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.888
I'll speak to her later.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.392
As for you girls,

12:03.424 --> 12:08.365
how could you even think of
having a drunken spree in my house?

12:10.101 --> 12:12.104
There'll be no party here.

12:12.138 --> 12:13.473
The house is closed.

12:13.505 --> 12:16.612
I want you all out by tomorrow.

12:16.645 --> 12:20.318
Good night.

12:20.350 --> 12:26.861
Sheesh.

12:26.894 --> 12:29.331
The wicked witch of the
west strikes again.

12:29.364 --> 12:31.067
She can't kick us out, can she?

12:31.101 --> 12:34.138
No way. The bylaws
say we can stay.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.876
Like always, she's just
flapping her wings.

12:36.910 --> 12:39.915
Why does she always close
the house on June 19th?

12:39.947 --> 12:41.984
Every other house stays
open through the weekend.

12:42.017 --> 12:43.387
Who knows?

12:43.420 --> 12:46.023
-She's retiring, anyways.
-Nuh-who said?

12:46.056 --> 12:48.594
-I heard talk about it.
-I can't believe it!

12:48.627 --> 12:52.033
-She's an institution around here.
-She's the sorority mascot.

12:52.066 --> 12:55.571
Yeah, the house jackass.

12:55.604 --> 12:58.376
Well, maybe this place'll
finally get a normal house mother.

12:58.409 --> 13:01.825
The kind who sits in her
room and drinks tea.

13:01.826 --> 13:03.763
She is different.

13:03.797 --> 13:06.802
Just a shame she's
gotten so weird.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.338
She used to lend a little tradition
to the house, you know?

13:09.372 --> 13:12.311
Slater is the last
of her breed.

13:12.344 --> 13:16.117
When she goes, the
species'll be extinct.

13:16.150 --> 13:17.353
Let's propose a toast.

13:18.753 --> 13:20.923
To Mrs. Slater.

13:20.956 --> 13:24.462
The house mother to end
all house mothers.

13:24.496 --> 13:30.072
Yeah, that's for sure.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.976
Wait a
minute. Not here.

15:16.008 --> 15:18.145
Why not?
We always do it here.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.916
Not tonight.

15:20.950 --> 15:23.555
Count to 20, I'll
meet you upstairs.

15:23.588 --> 15:30.164
-What?
-Count to 20, Rick.

15:37.510 --> 15:41.449
Vicki?

15:41.482 --> 15:46.625
Vicki?

15:46.657 --> 15:51.465
Vicki?

15:55.037 --> 16:00.046
Look what daddy bought
his little girl.

18:50.251 --> 18:52.554
You filth!

18:52.588 --> 18:57.562
Trash like you doesn't
belong in my house.

18:57.594 --> 19:04.406
Slater, I'm
going to kill you!

19:04.440 --> 19:05.809
You bitch!

19:08.812 --> 19:11.418
I'll get back at you if
it's the last thing I do!

19:11.450 --> 19:16.793
You hear me, goddamn it!

19:16.826 --> 19:23.839
-Vicki, what are you doing?
-Bitch!

19:27.511 --> 19:28.712
Vicki, what
are you doing?

19:28.745 --> 19:30.415
We can't swim
the damn thing, anyway,

19:30.448 --> 19:31.816
what's the difference?

19:31.850 --> 19:36.292
Jesus.

19:36.325 --> 19:38.630
How was that romantic
little skinny-dip last night?

19:39.762 --> 19:41.099
You shut up.

19:41.131 --> 19:43.335
-Chill out.
-My water bed got slashed to pieces,

19:43.369 --> 19:45.506
and all I should
is joke about it?

19:45.539 --> 19:47.542
I'm telling you guys,
she tried to kill me!

19:47.575 --> 19:49.479
Come on, Vicki,
you deserved it.

19:49.511 --> 19:51.817
Can't you fuck anywhere else?

19:51.849 --> 19:53.585
Mrs. Slater really flipped.

19:53.618 --> 19:55.723
She's never gone
that crazy before.

19:55.755 --> 19:56.792
Wait till the party.

19:56.824 --> 19:58.927
God, when she sees the liquor,
she'll have a stroke.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.064
To hell with her.

20:01.098 --> 20:04.904
Sick of worrying about
what Slater thinks.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.773
We run this house!

20:06.806 --> 20:09.745
For four years, we've had to
put up with her and her shit!

20:09.779 --> 20:12.884
She's right, that lady's
been a royal pain in the ass.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.519
Yeah, well there's
been a million times

20:14.552 --> 20:16.790
that bitch has
screwed us all over.

20:16.823 --> 20:20.696
We can't let her get away
with this time, right?

20:20.729 --> 20:24.434
Do you have something in mind, or are
you just exercising your mouth again?

20:24.468 --> 20:25.972
Yeah, I do have
something in mind.

20:26.606 --> 20:29.711
Slater wants things to be
as they used to be, right?

20:29.744 --> 20:31.246
Ok.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.487
Well, how about if we give her a
good old-fashioned sorority prank?

20:35.519 --> 20:37.956
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

20:37.989 --> 20:39.692
What, are you kidding?

20:39.726 --> 20:44.769
-Like what?
-Wait a minute. Let me think.

20:44.802 --> 20:46.237
How about we
T.P. her room?

20:46.271 --> 20:47.072
No, no, no.

20:47.073 --> 20:49.476
How about the old dog shit
in a paper bag routine?

20:49.508 --> 20:51.445
No, we did that
freshman year, no.

20:51.479 --> 20:52.947
How about a bucket
of water over her door?

20:52.979 --> 20:54.115
So when she comes
in, she gets it?

20:54.149 --> 20:56.553
Tomorrow morning, we
could short-sheet her bed?

20:56.586 --> 20:58.021
No, no, no, no.
I got a great one.

20:58.055 --> 21:00.594
Let's spread glue on
her toilet seat!

21:00.627 --> 21:01.595
I got it!

21:01.628 --> 21:03.532
It's perfect!

21:03.564 --> 21:05.802
Well, are you interested or not?

21:05.835 --> 21:08.006
This is silly.

21:08.038 --> 21:11.577
I mean, we're supposed to be
mature adults by now, right?

21:11.610 --> 21:15.983
One more fling won't
set us back any.

21:16.016 --> 21:18.121
Ok.

21:18.155 --> 21:21.203
We'll do it on Friday, right
before our party starts?

21:21.204 --> 21:22.728
Ok, sounds great.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.863
Evaluation as follows,

21:43.895 --> 21:45.898
Condition clearly stems
from Mrs. Slater's

21:45.932 --> 21:48.503
extremely difficult and
traumatic delivery.

21:49.303 --> 21:52.043
Since that point, the
slow progression towards

21:52.075 --> 21:54.213
a psychotic break
has been evident.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.718
X-rays taken after
an errant cephalogram

21:57.751 --> 22:01.223
reveal the cortex undergoing
a process of decay.

22:01.257 --> 22:07.767
Patient's advanced age is
aggravating the condition.

22:07.800 --> 22:12.743
My recommendation is for
immediate advanced treatment.

22:12.776 --> 22:17.183
The next three months must be spent
under complete clinical supervision.

22:17.215 --> 22:20.185
Allowed to live in an
uncontrolled environment,

22:20.220 --> 22:24.794
there's a good chance that any traumatic
episode could act as a stimulus

22:24.827 --> 22:28.134
for the patient's
latent violence.

22:43.892 --> 22:45.862
Vicki, where'd you
get this thing?

22:45.894 --> 22:49.667
I have my sources.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.771
-Is it loaded?
-Of course not.

23:01.688 --> 23:05.160
Go ahead, it's not
going to bite you.

23:05.193 --> 23:06.930
Bam!

23:06.963 --> 23:09.934
That's not funny.

23:09.966 --> 23:11.402
Vicki, this is crazy.

23:11.436 --> 23:14.775
I mean, a joke is one
thing, but a gun?

23:14.807 --> 23:20.050
Trust me, Katie, have
I ever been wrong?

23:20.084 --> 23:23.056
Right before
the party starts,

23:23.089 --> 23:26.895
Slater's going to be in for
one very big surprise.

23:43.888 --> 23:45.458
Hold it,
hold it up here.

23:45.490 --> 23:48.429
Well, it's heavy.

23:48.462 --> 23:50.231
Ok.

23:50.264 --> 23:51.900
I think we're going
to have to go up.

23:53.204 --> 23:54.205
Ready?

23:54.240 --> 24:00.115
-You got it?
-Ok, don't drop it on me.

24:07.326 --> 24:09.897
Take all that junk down!

24:09.929 --> 24:11.999
It's a disgrace!

24:12.032 --> 24:14.304
I want all of you to
pack your belongings

24:14.338 --> 24:15.974
and leave this
house at once.

24:16.007 --> 24:18.877
Do you hear?

24:18.911 --> 24:21.047
What if we don't?

24:21.080 --> 24:25.254
You have a lot to learn
about this world, young lady.

24:25.288 --> 24:28.327
Mrs. Slater, you seem to
be missing something.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.130
Where is it?

24:30.162 --> 24:36.172
Go check out by the pool.

25:01.145 --> 25:02.982
Go ahead, take a swim.

25:03.015 --> 25:05.320
You like getting
people wet, right?

25:05.353 --> 25:07.088
I should teach you
a lesson or two.

25:07.122 --> 25:10.260
Are you threatening me?

25:10.292 --> 25:15.234
If that gun is real,
you are all in serious trouble.

25:15.268 --> 25:17.906
We thought you might need
a little persuading.

25:17.938 --> 25:19.441
What's wrong with a swim?

25:19.475 --> 25:24.417
Come on, it's not much to ask for four
years of putting up with your shit.

25:24.450 --> 25:27.155
Now, go on.

25:27.187 --> 25:30.158
-Get out of my way.
-Go on!

25:30.192 --> 25:33.197
Vicki...

25:36.102 --> 25:37.204
What the hell
are you doing?

25:37.237 --> 25:38.606
I know exactly
what I'm doing!

25:38.640 --> 25:40.042
Vicki, it's not
funny any more!

25:40.075 --> 25:41.077
Shut up, Liz!

25:41.109 --> 25:42.912
You all want this
as much as me.

25:42.945 --> 25:44.482
Someone's gonna hurt.
Give me that gun!

25:47.052 --> 25:50.591
She's all right.

25:50.623 --> 25:53.128
Ok, Slater.

25:53.161 --> 25:54.365
Move it!

25:55.666 --> 25:59.272
-Vicki, you don't want to do this!
-Come on!

25:59.306 --> 26:01.676
Shut up! Go on!

26:01.709 --> 26:04.413
-Vicki, Vicki, give me the gun.
-All the way in.

26:04.447 --> 26:07.385
Vicki, I don't
think you wanna do this.

26:07.419 --> 26:08.954
Vicki, what
are you doing?

26:08.988 --> 26:11.058
No! Stop!

26:11.092 --> 26:12.560
Vicki, don't!

26:12.593 --> 26:13.562
Vicki, no!

26:23.577 --> 26:24.712
You
didn't really think...

26:24.746 --> 26:27.617
-You're wonderful!
-You don't believe us?

26:37.766 --> 26:42.541
My God.

26:42.575 --> 26:44.144
Get a blanket, somebody!

26:44.176 --> 26:46.181
Quick, quick!
Get her out!

26:46.214 --> 26:49.085
All right, all right, easy, easy.
Watch her head, watch her head.

26:49.118 --> 26:53.025
God, come on.

26:53.059 --> 26:55.196
Where is the blanket? Come on!

26:55.228 --> 26:57.031
Put her on a blanket!

26:57.065 --> 26:58.232
Ok, ok, who knows
what to do?

26:58.733 --> 27:01.038
Stevie, know what to do?

27:01.070 --> 27:02.239
Roll her over!
Roll her over!

27:02.272 --> 27:03.474
-This is impossible!
-Watch her head!

27:03.509 --> 27:08.216
-Shut up, Vicki!
-I don't think she's breathing, Stevie!

27:08.249 --> 27:09.618
She's not breathing!

27:09.651 --> 27:11.122
Try and get an
ambulance, move it!

27:11.154 --> 27:11.988
Wait a minute.

27:12.023 --> 27:13.025
What good's an
ambulance gonna do now?

27:13.057 --> 27:14.625
There might still
be a chance, hurry!

27:14.659 --> 27:15.827
Don't you realize
what we've done?

27:15.861 --> 27:20.302
-It was an accident!
-That doesn't matter!

27:20.335 --> 27:25.411
We killed her.

27:26.645 --> 27:30.117
My God,
the band's here.

27:30.151 --> 27:32.688
Vicki?

27:32.721 --> 27:34.424
Morgan, run to the
door and stall the band!

27:34.458 --> 27:38.365
-Hurry!
-Ok.

27:38.398 --> 27:44.275
Ok, shit.
She doesn't have any relatives.

27:44.307 --> 27:46.811
We either hide the body,
or face the police.

27:46.845 --> 27:50.783
I am calling an ambulance.

27:50.817 --> 27:54.657
Katie! Katie!

27:54.689 --> 27:58.362
If you call now,
it's over for all of us!

27:58.396 --> 28:00.401
Please, Katie,
please do what she says.

28:01.134 --> 28:02.036
I don't wanna get in trouble.

28:02.069 --> 28:10.648
Katherine, listen to Vicki.
You've got to!

28:10.682 --> 28:11.818
Come on, Vicki!

28:11.850 --> 28:13.322
What are we gonna do with her?

28:13.354 --> 28:14.856
Come on, let's hurry!

28:14.890 --> 28:16.125
Let's hide
her in the house.

28:16.159 --> 28:20.164
No, no,
someone'll find her.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.767
The pool.

28:21.799 --> 28:24.138
It's perfect for now. We can
get her out tomorrow morning.

28:24.172 --> 28:25.573
She's gonna float!
Won't she float?

28:25.606 --> 28:28.411
-Stevie, won't she float?
-How the hell should I know?

28:28.444 --> 28:30.575
I have an idea. Diane, run
to the porch and get as many

28:30.576 --> 28:32.552
towels as you can find,
something to sink her with.

28:32.585 --> 28:35.257
Stevie, go to the pool house, get a
rope, and something to cut it with.

28:35.289 --> 28:36.590
Hurry up!

28:36.624 --> 28:38.227
-Help me!
-Ok!

28:38.260 --> 28:39.296
Got it.

28:39.329 --> 28:44.571
Katie, you, too, come on!

28:44.603 --> 28:46.173
Jesus.

28:53.616 --> 28:54.985
Put it underneath her!

28:55.018 --> 28:56.220
I can't reach over...

28:56.253 --> 28:58.022
-Lift her head.
-I can't!

28:58.056 --> 28:59.991
-Just move her!
-Yes, you can. Lift it up a bit.

29:00.025 --> 29:01.460
Goddamn it, give it to me.

29:01.492 --> 29:03.695
-What about that down there?
-Put it through here.

29:03.729 --> 29:05.097
Tie this all through.

29:06.330 --> 29:08.333
-Make sure she's not gonna get out.
-It's ok.

29:08.366 --> 29:14.174
God!

29:24.217 --> 29:27.555
Get out of here.

30:30.757 --> 30:34.761
Zeta, Eta, Theta,
lota Lambda, Moo, Nu...

30:34.795 --> 30:38.667
-You forgot Kappa.
-Zeta...

30:38.699 --> 30:40.736
Yeah,
I heard Finzer failed.

30:40.769 --> 30:41.804
What?

30:41.836 --> 30:44.373
What do you care?
I thought you hated him.

30:44.405 --> 30:46.774
I do, but I copied
all his answers.

30:46.807 --> 30:48.143
Are you in a frat?

30:48.175 --> 30:49.511
Yeah, I'm a Beta.

30:49.545 --> 30:52.114
Really? You don't look
like a Greek.

30:52.146 --> 30:57.319
-Kata, Omicron, Pi.
-Hey, look at him.

30:57.353 --> 31:01.524
Yeah.
He is cute.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.190
Bobby?

31:31.224 --> 31:33.560
It's over this way.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.694
It's over here.

31:34.895 --> 31:38.165
My favorite tree in
the whole world.

31:38.197 --> 31:43.736
You gotta watch out for squirrels here,
cause they can jump real high.

31:43.770 --> 31:50.278
Here, you can use this one.

31:50.311 --> 31:52.179
Bobby?

32:25.516 --> 32:26.885
Vicki, where's Katherine?

32:26.917 --> 32:32.924
Peter... Katie's upstairs.

32:56.450 --> 32:58.385
Hi.

32:58.417 --> 32:59.521
You must be Katherine.

33:00.722 --> 33:03.425
I'm Peter, hi.

33:03.457 --> 33:07.461
-Hello.
-Vicki told me... are you ok?

33:07.494 --> 33:13.936
Yeah. I'm ok.

33:13.968 --> 33:15.471
Would you like to
be left alone?

33:16.272 --> 33:21.745
No, it's just... its nothing.

33:23.045 --> 33:24.415
Damn it.

33:25.482 --> 33:27.585
Look, blind dates
are silly, anyway.

33:29.954 --> 33:32.957
Why don't I just go?

33:32.989 --> 33:36.627
Wait...

33:36.660 --> 33:39.597
I'm all right, really.

33:39.631 --> 33:41.967
Are you sure?

33:41.999 --> 33:45.603
You
wanna go downstairs?

33:45.636 --> 33:46.771
Great, great.

33:46.805 --> 33:51.543
I bought this for you.

33:51.575 --> 33:52.813
It was very sweet.

33:53.613 --> 33:55.849
Thank you.

34:11.665 --> 34:13.467
Do you wanna dance?

34:13.500 --> 34:16.004
Not now.

34:16.036 --> 34:17.672
How about a drink?

34:17.705 --> 34:19.009
Maybe later.

34:20.408 --> 34:21.978
I could use one.

34:22.011 --> 34:23.413
I'll be right back, ok?

35:14.135 --> 35:15.737
Get the... help me!

35:16.804 --> 35:19.807
One... two...

35:19.840 --> 35:21.143
-There's a wet t-shirt contest!
-Really?

35:21.176 --> 35:24.880
Yeah, yeah.

35:24.913 --> 35:26.982
Nice try!

35:28.783 --> 35:29.751
That one was good.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.756
-Are you ok?
-Get her out of there. My God.

35:32.789 --> 35:36.793
Diane, here give me...

35:36.826 --> 35:37.927
Careful.

35:40.695 --> 35:42.665
Shit, the pool lights.

35:42.865 --> 35:44.434
What is somebody
turns them on?

38:23.075 --> 38:24.644
No, no, please.

38:25.010 --> 38:27.912
No, please, no!

38:35.888 --> 38:39.125
Thank you very much.

38:39.158 --> 38:41.027
Thank you.

38:41.060 --> 38:42.796
We've come to a special part
of the evening tonight,

38:42.829 --> 38:44.865
I think one you've all
been waiting for.

38:45.231 --> 38:47.000
Will you, just clear the
dance floor here please?

38:47.034 --> 38:50.070
Get everybody to back
off a little bit.

38:50.104 --> 38:51.073
That's good.

38:51.105 --> 38:54.108
Let's get our graduating
ladies out front here.

38:54.141 --> 38:57.312
Give em a big hand!

38:57.345 --> 39:05.954
Let's get em all
out front here.

39:05.987 --> 39:08.757
Ok, quiet down, quiet down
out there, quiet down.

39:08.791 --> 39:10.626
Where's Stevie?

39:10.659 --> 39:13.229
She's upstairs polishing
her tennis shoes.

39:18.635 --> 39:22.072
Ok, we're gonna the snowball off
with these six ladies up here.

39:22.105 --> 39:24.708
You all can join
in after while.

39:24.741 --> 39:28.746
Vicki?

39:35.687 --> 39:38.089
Where's my gun?

39:38.122 --> 39:42.161
Upstairs.

39:42.194 --> 39:44.296
Hey, how'd your
little prank go?

39:44.330 --> 39:48.335
Just fine.

40:08.757 --> 40:10.292
This is really gross.

40:10.324 --> 40:12.261
When's the last time
they cleaned this pool?

40:12.294 --> 40:14.429
Looks ok to me.

40:23.338 --> 40:26.743
Where is Stevie?

40:26.776 --> 40:28.845
I can't believe a
house mother like

40:28.879 --> 40:30.948
Mrs. Slater would let
all this happen.

40:32.248 --> 40:33.850
Just the way
I like it.

40:33.884 --> 40:35.953
Well, go ahead,
pig, jump in!

40:35.986 --> 40:40.992
Wait a minute,
I gotta prepare.

40:52.303 --> 40:56.374
You know, I'm really
glad this is working out.

40:56.408 --> 41:02.449
I'm really having a
nice time. Are you?

41:02.482 --> 41:03.951
I'm a sea pig!

41:09.890 --> 41:14.896
My God!

41:31.948 --> 41:33.349
I'm a sea pig.

41:45.362 --> 41:51.168
She's alive.

41:51.201 --> 41:55.440
We put her back in the pool,
and she was still alive!

41:55.472 --> 41:57.544
You and Stevie are the ones
to blame for that.

41:57.576 --> 41:59.411
You said she was dead, not me!

41:59.444 --> 42:00.711
Who's to blame for shooting her!

42:00.747 --> 42:02.982
How was I supposed to know
there's another bullet in the gun!

42:03.015 --> 42:08.020
It doesn't matter now.

42:08.054 --> 42:09.689
Where is Stevie?

42:09.723 --> 42:11.591
I've looked all over for her.

42:11.592 --> 42:15.329
She must have left before
she could turn off the...

42:15.363 --> 42:17.130
It's a good thing she didn't.

42:17.164 --> 42:20.267
We would have never known
Mrs. Slater is still alive.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.403
How do we know she is alive?

42:22.436 --> 42:24.038
What do you think she
floated out of that pool?

42:24.071 --> 42:25.941
Or, maybe she got
sucked down the drain?

42:25.973 --> 42:27.107
Do you believe this?

42:27.140 --> 42:28.410
Look what we're talking about!

42:28.443 --> 42:31.011
Jeanie, stop.

42:31.044 --> 42:32.547
Morgan may be right.

42:32.581 --> 42:34.362
Mrs. Slater could have
collapsed somewhere

42:34.363 --> 42:35.550
just after getting
out of the pool.

42:35.583 --> 42:39.888
We have got to find her,
before somebody else does.

42:39.922 --> 42:43.327
I cannot believe you, Vicki.

42:43.359 --> 42:48.232
You'd sacrifice anything
to save yourself.

42:48.266 --> 42:51.535
Even Mrs. Slater's life?

42:51.568 --> 42:56.574
And what about
the rest of you?

43:01.646 --> 43:04.615
I am calling the police,
I cannot live with this anymore.

43:04.649 --> 43:06.452
Listen to me!

43:06.484 --> 43:09.153
If she were alive, wouldn't
the police be here by now?

43:09.187 --> 43:10.955
She's right, she would
have called hours ago.

43:10.988 --> 43:12.091
What if she can't?

43:12.125 --> 43:15.561
What if she's lying on the
ground bleeding to death?

43:15.594 --> 43:20.132
If she were alive, she
would have reached a telephone.

43:20.165 --> 43:22.301
Face it, Katie.

43:22.335 --> 43:30.178
Mrs. Slater is dead.

43:30.210 --> 43:31.311
She won't call.

43:31.345 --> 43:32.914
But what do we do?

43:33.113 --> 43:35.316
Well, Mrs. Slater couldn't
have gotten far.

43:35.349 --> 43:37.218
Let's check around the
outside of the house.

43:37.251 --> 43:40.288
Morgan, go unpack Slater's clothes,
so it looks like she's left.

43:40.321 --> 43:46.227
We can find her, but we're
gonna have to hurry.

44:31.411 --> 44:33.280
-Don't do that, Diane!
-I'm sorry.

44:33.313 --> 44:35.115
-Have you seen anything?
-No, have you?

44:35.148 --> 44:40.155
No. Come on.

46:00.088 --> 46:02.091
Water?

46:02.125 --> 46:04.527
Give me something stronger.

46:04.560 --> 46:09.167
She's all right.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.504
How'd she ever get up
in the attic like that?

46:11.538 --> 46:13.806
Why would she struggle all
that way, just to get up there?

46:13.841 --> 46:14.943
God, who knows?

46:14.975 --> 46:16.344
Where's her cane?

46:16.378 --> 46:18.980
I don't know! Must be in the
attic, I didn't see it in the pool.

46:19.014 --> 46:21.918
Don't have time to worry about
that now! We gotta get rid of her!

46:21.951 --> 46:23.821
-Ok.
-What about the old cemetery?

46:23.853 --> 46:32.234
Nobody would ever
find her there.

46:32.267 --> 46:33.668
Get
away from her!

46:36.204 --> 46:37.507
Morgan!

46:37.539 --> 46:40.843
-God.
-Let her go!

46:40.877 --> 46:43.882
We haven't got time to
waste pampering her!

46:43.915 --> 46:44.950
She's a baby.

46:44.983 --> 46:47.786
Her and Stevie, leaving
us to do this ourselves.

46:47.819 --> 46:50.222
For Christ's sakes,
we're in this together.

46:50.255 --> 46:56.266
After this is over...

47:00.571 --> 47:02.541
Cowards.

47:02.574 --> 47:04.909
You're all a bunch
of goddamn cowards.

48:48.716 --> 48:52.722
Morgan?

48:58.863 --> 49:04.071
Have you guys seen Morgan?

49:04.104 --> 49:08.109
Morgan?

49:30.204 --> 49:32.108
Morgan, it's me.

49:32.142 --> 49:33.978
Are you in there?

49:34.011 --> 49:38.017
Morgan?

50:24.880 --> 50:27.316
We're not carrying
her all the way, are we?

50:27.348 --> 50:28.550
Nope.

50:28.584 --> 50:29.819
Hey, hey, where did you get those?
Those are mine!

50:29.853 --> 50:32.823
-We're using your car, Liz.
-No, wait! I just got it!

50:32.857 --> 50:34.892
Goddamn it, Liz, yours is the
only car that isn't blocked in.

50:34.926 --> 50:36.460
Forget it,
we're not using it!

50:36.494 --> 50:38.833
Diane, you take them.

50:38.865 --> 50:41.268
Wait, it's too crowded in
the front of the house.

50:41.300 --> 50:42.504
We'll meet you at
the old garage.

50:42.537 --> 50:43.471
Hurry!

50:43.504 --> 50:46.041
God, we gotta find
something to put her in.

50:46.074 --> 50:47.076
What we are gonna use?

50:48.477 --> 50:53.852
Vicki?

50:53.885 --> 51:00.528
That's perfect.

51:11.408 --> 51:16.015
Watch the feet, Liz,
be... shit. Come on.

51:16.048 --> 51:18.451
Ouch.

51:28.399 --> 51:31.102
Come on.

54:57.981 --> 54:59.350
God!

54:59.548 --> 55:00.752
What are you
doing up here?

55:01.720 --> 55:03.888
I'm not really sure.

55:03.921 --> 55:05.391
Well, I saw you
go up the steps,

55:05.424 --> 55:07.561
and I was just
wondering what you...

55:09.296 --> 55:11.900
Look at all this stuff.

55:11.933 --> 55:15.872
This is a neat room.

55:15.905 --> 55:22.949
You know what?
Why don't you go downstairs?

55:26.319 --> 55:30.358
This used to be
one of my favorite things.

55:30.390 --> 55:38.502
Peter, why don't you go downstairs
and get yourself another drink?

55:38.535 --> 55:45.612
-My God.
-What is it?

55:45.646 --> 55:47.749
-Peter, go, go downstairs.
-But...

55:47.781 --> 55:51.788
Go on!

56:44.523 --> 56:51.934
Is that you guys?

56:51.968 --> 56:57.543
Jeanie?

56:57.575 --> 57:00.079
Vicki?

57:02.682 --> 57:05.687
Liz?

57:51.982 --> 57:54.719
We just have to get to the
garage, and we're home free.

57:54.752 --> 57:56.622
What is someone sees us?

57:56.655 --> 57:58.925
Stop
worrying, just push!

58:00.058 --> 58:01.628
Almost there.

58:06.501 --> 58:07.771
You guys, my dress...

58:08.238 --> 58:14.446
Hurry, get out of here.

58:27.563 --> 58:29.165
Come here.

58:29.198 --> 58:36.641
Come here!

58:36.674 --> 58:37.944
657 to dispatch.

58:38.177 --> 58:39.613
657, go ahead.

58:39.646 --> 58:41.482
Yeah, I got a
fender bender here.

58:41.515 --> 58:44.920
Send car 412 down here
on campus on my 1020.

58:44.954 --> 58:46.055
Ten-four, acknowledged.

58:46.088 --> 58:47.157
Yeah, and
also be advised

58:47.189 --> 58:50.027
I got two female suspects here.

58:50.061 --> 58:52.197
Ten-four.
Please keep us advised.

58:52.229 --> 58:53.633
Ten-four.

58:55.202 --> 58:57.572
Hell of a time to be
taking out the trash.

58:58.105 --> 59:00.682
We always take the trash
out on Friday night.

59:00.683 --> 59:01.542
Yeah.

59:01.575 --> 59:03.979
At 1:43
in the morning?

59:04.981 --> 59:06.014
Sororities.

59:06.682 --> 59:07.717
What you got in there?

59:07.751 --> 59:09.754
Nothing, officer.
We had a large party tonight,

59:09.787 --> 59:11.154
there's a lot of people
who had a lot of...

59:11.188 --> 59:13.091
We had an awful lot of
garbage to get rid of.

59:13.124 --> 59:14.495
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:14.928 --> 59:16.062
657, go ahead.

59:16.094 --> 59:18.798
1019 to station.

59:18.831 --> 59:20.600
I'll be right there.

59:20.633 --> 59:23.105
Look, turn this thing around
and get it back up to house.

59:23.139 --> 59:26.644
And don't let me catch you around
here anymore, you understand?

59:26.676 --> 59:35.788
-We'll see, thank you, officer.
-Good night.

01:00:00.957 --> 01:00:07.831
Jeanie!

01:00:07.864 --> 01:00:10.069
Jeanie, what happened?

01:00:10.103 --> 01:00:12.706
Did somebody do this to you?

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:15.643
Who?

01:00:15.676 --> 01:00:18.245
Where did it happen?

01:00:18.279 --> 01:00:22.185
-Gate.
-Gate?

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:24.120
Jeanie, I'm gonna
have to get help.

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:25.756
I'm gonna get somebody,
we'll take you to the hospital.

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:28.727
Cane.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.963
Cane.

01:00:31.564 --> 01:00:37.105
Ok, Jeanie, it's gonna be all right,
ok? I promise. I'll be right back, ok?

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:41.144
Come on.

01:00:49.154 --> 01:00:52.759
Bye, meet me down
at the bar, ok?

01:03:28.635 --> 01:03:30.504
Jeanie!?

01:03:30.538 --> 01:03:35.312
Katherine, what are you, what is
wrong? Why won't you just tell me?

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:38.083
Something's happened to them.

01:03:38.117 --> 01:03:40.385
What are
you talking about?

01:03:40.419 --> 01:03:43.023
Three of my
friends are missing.

01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:46.961
I'm calling the police.

01:03:46.994 --> 01:03:51.267
Are you sure about this?

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.903
Couldn't they have
just left the party?

01:03:52.937 --> 01:03:54.812
Nobody saw them leave,
and Jeanie was in

01:03:54.813 --> 01:03:56.642
no condition to go
anyplace by herself.

01:03:56.675 --> 01:03:58.143
Should I get
your house mother?

01:03:58.175 --> 01:04:00.212
They're gonna wanna
speak to her.

01:04:00.245 --> 01:04:02.282
Sheriff's department.

01:04:02.315 --> 01:04:04.117
This is Sgt. Palmer.

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.253
Hello?

01:04:06.287 --> 01:04:07.456
Hello?

01:04:07.489 --> 01:04:09.592
What are you doing?

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:12.095
Katherine?

01:04:12.128 --> 01:04:17.602
You're probably right, that they
just must have left the party.

01:04:17.635 --> 01:04:19.404
It's late, I think you
better be leaving.

01:04:23.209 --> 01:04:24.579
I'm sorry, Peter.

01:04:37.428 --> 01:04:38.698
She isn't here!

01:04:39.564 --> 01:04:42.102
What?

01:04:42.135 --> 01:04:43.670
Diane?

01:04:43.704 --> 01:04:46.342
Diane?

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:50.647
Diane? The keys are
here. Where is she?

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:52.649
This is
really unbelievable.

01:04:52.683 --> 01:04:55.320
Why am I always
saving everyone's ass?

01:04:55.353 --> 01:05:01.362
Forget it, let's just
get this over with.

01:05:41.148 --> 01:05:44.786
I'm sorry to be calling so
late, but I found this necklace.

01:05:44.819 --> 01:05:45.712
Who is this?

01:05:45.713 --> 01:05:48.392
My name's Katherine Rose,
you don't know me.

01:05:48.424 --> 01:05:52.530
I found this medical alert tag, and I
called the number, they connected me.

01:05:52.563 --> 01:05:54.166
What's
the name on the tag?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.502
-Slater.
-Dorothy Slater?

01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:58.539
Yes, she's our house
mother at the sorority.

01:05:58.572 --> 01:05:59.773
That's where I'm calling from.

01:05:59.806 --> 01:06:02.777
Yes I know the house.
is something wrong?

01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:06.482
Well, during our party here,
one of the girls was...

01:06:06.515 --> 01:06:08.285
attacked...

01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:10.154
that's where I found the tag.

01:06:10.187 --> 01:06:11.288
Where's
the girl now?

01:06:11.321 --> 01:06:12.290
I don't know.

01:06:12.324 --> 01:06:14.860
She's disappeared.
Two other girls have also.

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:18.164
Where's Mrs. Slater?

01:06:18.197 --> 01:06:19.367
She's not here.

01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:22.737
Now,
listen to me carefully.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.574
I doubt anything's happened
to your friends.

01:06:24.873 --> 01:06:26.643
But I think I'd
better come over.

01:06:27.176 --> 01:06:29.313
Stay in the house
until I arrive.

01:06:47.999 --> 01:06:49.336
I don't see any.

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:50.438
Wait!

01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:55.476
There's one over there.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:08.492
Ok.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.528
We'll dig it a couple of
feet deeper and we're set.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:17.570
-All right.
-Come on.

01:07:41.664 --> 01:07:43.601
-Dr. Beck?
-Yes, Katherine?

01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:47.004
-Yes, please come in.
-Thank you.

01:07:47.038 --> 01:07:50.174
I found this in the room of one
of the girls who disappeared.

01:07:50.206 --> 01:07:55.414
A few nights ago I heard
music coming from up here.

01:07:55.447 --> 01:07:58.151
Mrs. Slater must have spent
a lot of time in this room.

01:07:58.185 --> 01:07:59.620
What else
have you found?

01:08:06.793 --> 01:08:08.930
We have to find Mrs. Slater.

01:08:08.964 --> 01:08:13.970
Do you know where she is?

01:08:21.044 --> 01:08:25.850
Why did she wear this?

01:08:32.557 --> 01:08:34.493
24 years ago,
she came to me.

01:08:36.127 --> 01:08:40.166
She heard about my work with other
women, unable to bear children.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.903
As risky as it was, and knowing
the odds were against her,

01:08:42.935 --> 01:08:46.474
she went through with
the experimental procedure.

01:08:46.508 --> 01:08:49.511
All she ever wanted in life
was to have a child.

01:08:49.545 --> 01:08:51.948
What happened?

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:55.618
It was a bitter disappointment
for her, as much as for me.

01:08:55.652 --> 01:08:58.689
The delivery
was terribly traumatic.

01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:04.261
Ever since then, she's been
in a world of her own.

01:09:04.295 --> 01:09:05.798
Who's Eric?

01:09:07.732 --> 01:09:08.901
Where did you hear that name?

01:09:08.934 --> 01:09:13.906
It's on the card, right there.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:16.747
Every June 19th she
celebrates his birthday,

01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:20.015
as if she had a normal,
loving son.

01:09:20.046 --> 01:09:24.852
So that's why she always closed
the house before June 19th.

01:09:24.886 --> 01:09:29.026
Katherine, we've got
to find Mrs. Slater.

01:09:29.058 --> 01:09:30.225
Where is she?

01:09:35.299 --> 01:09:40.906
That tag, I found it in the same
spot where Jeanie was attacked.

01:09:40.938 --> 01:09:42.341
Could Mrs. Slater have done...

01:09:42.374 --> 01:09:44.710
You think Mrs. Slater has something
to do with your missing friend?

01:09:44.743 --> 01:09:46.845
I don't know!

01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:50.951
There's something you're
not telling me.

01:09:50.984 --> 01:09:56.991
-What is it?
-My god.

01:10:32.033 --> 01:10:35.171
All right, all right.
All right, Katherine.

01:10:35.204 --> 01:10:38.908
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:43.680
No!

01:10:43.714 --> 01:10:47.217
Three girls
at 413 Danfair Road.

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:50.955
That's on the Sorority Row.

01:10:50.988 --> 01:10:53.291
Yes, Dr. Nelson Beck!

01:10:55.292 --> 01:10:56.193
Wait a minute.

01:10:56.228 --> 01:10:58.731
One second,
officer. What is it?

01:10:58.765 --> 01:11:00.301
Cemetery.

01:11:00.334 --> 01:11:04.672
Vicki and Liz must still be
there. It's less than a mile away.

01:11:04.704 --> 01:11:05.905
Mrs. Slater could
have followed them.

01:11:05.938 --> 01:11:07.643
What cemetery?

01:11:07.675 --> 01:11:10.678
Parkview, on Perry Street.

01:11:10.711 --> 01:11:12.179
Hello, officer?

01:11:12.214 --> 01:11:16.085
We think she may have headed for the
Parkview Cemetery on Perry Street.

01:11:16.117 --> 01:11:18.721
Two girls are there now.

01:11:18.755 --> 01:11:20.858
Yes! I'll meet you there!

01:11:24.161 --> 01:11:27.999
Is it deep enough yet?

01:11:28.031 --> 01:11:30.001
Yeah, that
oughta do it.

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:34.040
Why don't you go pull
the van around?

01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:17.790
Liz, what
are you doing?!

01:12:17.824 --> 01:12:22.162
Liz?

01:12:29.036 --> 01:12:30.906
Liz!

01:12:30.939 --> 01:12:33.910
Shit! What are you doing?

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:09.119
The gun went off again.

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:14.058
She fell back in the water.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:16.160
I wanted to call an ambulance,

01:13:16.928 --> 01:13:22.869
but we were so scared.

01:13:22.901 --> 01:13:28.909
We thought that she
was dead.

01:13:29.575 --> 01:13:34.782
The body we found must
have been Stevie's.

01:14:37.324 --> 01:14:39.627
He's alive.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.933
Please, get back in the car.

01:14:44.965 --> 01:14:48.035
Please.

01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:52.207
Come.

01:15:22.376 --> 01:15:24.146
What happened to the police?

01:15:24.178 --> 01:15:25.381
They're not coming.

01:15:26.013 --> 01:15:27.482
Yes they are, they
said they were!

01:15:27.516 --> 01:15:30.354
What are you doing?

01:15:30.387 --> 01:15:34.191
Just a mild sedative.

01:15:34.223 --> 01:15:39.362
Please, get out of the car.

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:52.413
Come on.

01:15:52.446 --> 01:15:55.449
Stay there.

01:16:17.174 --> 01:16:25.185
Come on, come on, come on.
Get up, get up, get up.

01:16:49.612 --> 01:16:51.648
Stay there.
It's all right.

01:16:51.682 --> 01:16:56.689
Relax, Katherine.

01:17:02.328 --> 01:17:05.199
Mrs. Slater was the last
one I used the drug on.

01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:09.336
Like the others, Eric was born
with certain abnormalities.

01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:18.448
I warned her, it's what we
expected would happen.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.416
Eric spent every summer away
from the clinic in the attic.

01:17:21.449 --> 01:17:23.721
I told Mrs. Slater that his
condition was worsening.

01:17:24.386 --> 01:17:25.689
She wouldn't listen.

01:17:27.624 --> 01:17:29.527
He must have seen everything
from the attic window.

01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:37.237
Do you understand?
I must find him.

01:17:37.269 --> 01:17:43.309
You're the last one of
your friends alive.

01:17:43.343 --> 01:17:44.345
You're the bait.

01:17:44.878 --> 01:17:46.613
No.

01:17:46.646 --> 01:17:49.284
Don't move, or make a sound.

01:18:29.832 --> 01:18:31.835
How are you, Katherine?

01:19:25.564 --> 01:19:31.572
Peter, no!

01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:41.888
Katherine, the only way
to get Eric is to trap him.

01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:55.371
That boy downstairs
is only tranquilized.

01:20:55.404 --> 01:20:58.908
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:00.577
I've got to find him.

01:21:00.609 --> 01:21:01.944
No one must know about him.

01:21:01.978 --> 01:21:08.519
I'd be ruined if anyone
knew what I did.

01:21:08.553 --> 01:21:12.858
I beg you.

01:21:12.891 --> 01:21:14.993
You've got to help me.

01:21:15.027 --> 01:21:19.100
I must bring Eric back!

01:21:19.132 --> 01:21:20.701
Katherine...

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.115
No, no!

01:22:58.149 --> 01:23:01.488
Mom...

01:23:21.944 --> 01:23:23.813
Ok.

01:23:23.846 --> 01:23:29.953
Ok, ok.

01:26:25.795 --> 01:26:28.465
Katie, it's all Vicki's fault.

01:26:28.499 --> 01:26:30.734
Katie, why did you
call the police?

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:31.904
Katie, it's your turn.

01:26:31.936 --> 01:26:34.271
-We're waiting for you.
-Katie, come on.

01:26:34.304 --> 01:26:36.906
We're waiting. Come on.

01:26:36.938 --> 01:26:39.341
Katie, come on.

01:26:39.373 --> 01:26:42.243
We won't go away, Katie.
