WEBVTT

00:00.985 --> 00:02.185
Gabi?

00:08.993 --> 00:11.326
"I took your advice, Sofia."

00:11.362 --> 00:13.062
Hmm.

00:13.097 --> 00:16.241
"By the time you read this,
I'll be on the plane with Josh,

00:16.265 --> 00:19.922
and we'll be one of those annoying
couples who can't stop making out."

00:19.947 --> 00:21.545
- Aww.
- "Thank you.

00:21.570 --> 00:24.539
"I would have never done
this without you pushing me.

00:24.573 --> 00:27.471
- (phone ringing)
- "I love you, I love you, I love you."

00:27.541 --> 00:30.097
<i>I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!</i>

00:30.312 --> 00:35.414
(sobbing and muttering)

00:35.449 --> 00:37.473
...his therapist!

00:37.498 --> 00:39.485
Josh is on the plane
with his therapist?!

00:39.520 --> 00:40.953
Yes.

00:40.989 --> 00:42.454
Did you say anything to him?

00:42.490 --> 00:44.935
No. What was I supposed to say?

00:44.960 --> 00:48.435
That I thought I was ready to
forgive him because I'm so stupid?

00:48.460 --> 00:52.579
Or... or how I thought he was my
one-in-a-million 'cause I'm so stupid?

00:52.604 --> 00:56.168
Or how I thought he was excited
to see me 'cause I'm so stupid?

00:56.718 --> 00:58.693
Gabi, you have to stop blaming yourself.

00:58.718 --> 01:02.245
<i>You know what? You're
right. I blame you!</i>

01:03.109 --> 01:06.224
You're the one who told me to come on
the plane and throw myself in his arms

01:06.249 --> 01:07.678
like a big stupid!

01:08.366 --> 01:10.681
Okay, Gabi, just calm down.

01:10.717 --> 01:12.183
You're already on the plane.

01:12.209 --> 01:15.125
And hey, you always
wanted to go to Australia.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.821
No, I haven't!

01:17.223 --> 01:22.363
This stupid plane is stopping in Hawaii,
which makes this trip even longer.

01:22.388 --> 01:25.041
No, no, that's great. You
just get off in Hawaii.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.059
And do what?

01:27.084 --> 01:30.742
I don't know anybody. I
don't speak the language.

01:31.767 --> 01:34.390
Listen to me, just get
off the plane in Hawaii,

01:34.401 --> 01:36.148
and then buy a ticket to San Francisco.

01:36.549 --> 01:38.276
I can't.

01:38.301 --> 01:41.779
I used up all my miles with
a one-way trip to Australia.

01:41.804 --> 01:43.649
That's okay. You can use some of mine.

01:43.674 --> 01:45.916
You don't have any left either.

01:46.717 --> 01:48.250
I'm sorry.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.531
I may have a way to help you out.

01:52.556 --> 01:54.335
I'll do it. What is it? I'll do it.

01:55.939 --> 01:57.939
(theme music playing)

02:01.278 --> 02:03.367
<i>♪ She in the spotlight ♪</i>

02:03.392 --> 02:05.176
<i>♪ And she turned my head ♪</i>

02:17.860 --> 02:22.460
So, um, how is it exactly
that you're going to help me?

02:23.385 --> 02:25.099
Okay. This is the thing.

02:25.307 --> 02:29.642
I'm in a situation very similar
to yours, but way sadder.

02:30.145 --> 02:34.009
Okay, no offense, but there is nothing
worse than what just happened to me.

02:34.770 --> 02:36.504
I got stood up at the altar.

02:37.340 --> 02:39.241
Okay, I'm gonna give
you one of these back.

02:39.815 --> 02:41.103
Oh, there's more.

02:41.379 --> 02:46.546
I am on my honeymoon
right now, by myself.

02:47.199 --> 02:48.964
You're on your "one-y-moon"?

02:50.072 --> 02:52.064
That would be funny if
I hadn't had my heart

02:52.089 --> 02:53.795
ripped from my body and stomped on.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.130
(sighs)

02:55.155 --> 02:56.475
So, here's my offer.

02:56.500 --> 03:01.261
I'm heading to this resort in
Maui called Flip Flops for Lovers,

03:02.524 --> 03:06.128
which I have been exploring on my phone,

03:06.153 --> 03:09.962
only to find out that the entire
resort is for couples only.

03:10.844 --> 03:12.810
Which is where you come in.

03:13.571 --> 03:16.780
Are you asking me to
ask Josh and Dr. Rounds

03:16.805 --> 03:18.987
if they want to buy your
honeymoon package off of you?

03:20.245 --> 03:21.767
What? No.

03:21.972 --> 03:26.690
I was gonna suggest that you
come on my honeymoon with me.

03:26.818 --> 03:28.114
Not for sex or anything.

03:28.139 --> 03:31.254
You mean, like, as mutually
devastated strangers?

03:32.227 --> 03:33.427
Exactly.

03:33.452 --> 03:34.826
And before you answer,

03:34.851 --> 03:37.367
my name is Adam Foley.

03:37.586 --> 03:39.012
I'm a really good guy.

03:39.037 --> 03:40.336
Let's Google me.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.372
So, look,

03:43.407 --> 03:45.193
I own my own T-shirt company.

03:45.218 --> 03:46.645
"Shirt-for-brains."

03:47.952 --> 03:50.544
I made this shirt.

03:51.514 --> 03:53.247
Ju Mar!

03:53.272 --> 03:56.000
Hahaha! I don't get it.

03:57.127 --> 03:59.462
Amanda was supposed
to wear the other half.

03:59.487 --> 04:01.022
(gasps)

04:01.058 --> 04:02.789
Aww!

04:02.916 --> 04:04.619
Oh...

04:05.428 --> 04:06.795
So, what do you say?

04:07.099 --> 04:11.849
Come with me, and, in return, I'll
buy you a ticket back to San Francisco?

04:11.874 --> 04:12.995
(scoffs)

04:13.020 --> 04:16.870
I don't know. A luxury hotel, free
food, free booze. What's in it for me?

04:16.896 --> 04:19.151
(laughs)

04:19.176 --> 04:22.535
Gabi, will you be my fake wife?

04:22.560 --> 04:25.294
- Fake yeah, I will. (laughing)
- (laughing)

04:32.030 --> 04:35.169
I can't believe our rental beach
house turned out to be such a hellhole.

04:35.194 --> 04:37.621
It was so old and disgusting in person.

04:37.646 --> 04:39.592
It looked nothing like the photos.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.135
Well, now you know how
all your online dates feel.

04:44.727 --> 04:46.822
I just got off the phone
with the rental company,

04:46.847 --> 04:50.268
- and they're giving us a full refund.
- Oh! Then we can stay here.

04:50.293 --> 04:52.462
I already checked. They
still have rooms available.

04:52.487 --> 04:57.624
Aloha! I'm Danny. Welcome to Flip Flops
for Lovers, a couples only retreat.

04:57.649 --> 04:58.849
May I check you in?

04:58.874 --> 05:02.058
Wait. Couples only? As
in no singles allowed?

05:02.201 --> 05:05.254
Yup. So, which one of you is the couple?

05:05.279 --> 05:06.479
- We are.
- We are!

05:07.544 --> 05:09.947
Oh my God, you're a thrupple!?

05:10.599 --> 05:11.808
A whupple?

05:11.966 --> 05:13.517
A three-person couple.

05:13.542 --> 05:16.980
We're trying to increase business
by penetrating... no pun intended...

05:17.005 --> 05:18.876
the three-person relationship market.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.958
So, if you three are lovers,

05:20.983 --> 05:22.204
- Eww.
- Eww.

05:22.229 --> 05:23.751
I'll give you three nights for free?

05:23.776 --> 05:25.157
- Oh!
- Ménage à trois.

05:25.182 --> 05:27.082
- Spicy!
- Let's start having sex now.

05:27.772 --> 05:30.633
(Flight attendant) <i>And for those of
you continuing with us to Australia,</i>

05:30.658 --> 05:34.043
<i>please remain seated while
our Hawaii passengers deplane.</i>

05:34.578 --> 05:36.141
Wow, you know, I'm actually kind of glad

05:36.166 --> 05:38.058
the Dingo people sent me
on a commercial flight.

05:38.195 --> 05:39.958
Feels good to rough it
every once in a while.

05:40.312 --> 05:41.608
Ooh, hot towel!

05:43.720 --> 05:46.546
Plus, private jets are
much harder to sneak onto.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.249
Kidding.

05:48.659 --> 05:50.644
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:52.596 --> 05:54.238
You know, I've never been to Australia?

05:54.263 --> 05:57.043
- Mmm.
- I mean, look, koalas!

05:57.068 --> 05:58.348
Aww.

05:58.373 --> 06:00.792
I recently read the koala
population is suffering

06:00.817 --> 06:02.690
due to a catastrophic
outbreak of chlamydia.

06:02.715 --> 06:05.369
Yeah. I guess that's what they
get for being so darn cute.

06:05.394 --> 06:08.394
(laughing)

06:08.419 --> 06:10.901
You're funny. This is funny.

06:10.926 --> 06:12.240
Life's funny.

06:12.893 --> 06:15.164
- Yeah. (laughing)
- Mmm.

06:15.189 --> 06:16.415
What are we talking about?

06:16.783 --> 06:19.174
Just how we ended up
on this plane together.

06:19.909 --> 06:21.657
You bought a ticket and followed me?

06:21.971 --> 06:23.589
Should I have not done that?

06:24.693 --> 06:26.293
No. You know, it...

06:26.318 --> 06:28.685
it actually feels good to have
someone to talk to right now.

06:28.710 --> 06:31.425
And someone to see Australia with.

06:31.450 --> 06:34.192
Josh, you've been so consumed
with this Gabi situation,

06:34.217 --> 06:37.302
you need what we therapists
call "an emotional vacation."

06:37.327 --> 06:38.575
I like vacations.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.153
Great. So, maybe after the Dingo awards,

06:41.178 --> 06:43.146
we can visit the Sydney Opera House,

06:43.171 --> 06:44.808
hit up a few bars in Melbourne,

06:44.817 --> 06:47.261
and make passionate love
beside the Great Barrier Reef.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.243
What's that now?

06:51.260 --> 06:52.460
(scoffs)

06:52.485 --> 06:54.002
I'm kidding!

06:54.150 --> 06:56.773
(chuckles) It's all a part
of the emotional vacation.

06:56.798 --> 06:58.928
You gotta laugh, let loose,

06:58.953 --> 07:00.178
put a baby in me.

07:01.270 --> 07:03.457
- What?
- What?

07:03.482 --> 07:04.698
(laughs)

07:04.723 --> 07:06.090
This is fun.

07:10.266 --> 07:12.172
Oh. There they are.

07:12.197 --> 07:15.632
First two seats on the righ-ay-ay...
She's looking over here!

07:15.657 --> 07:19.486
Aww, look how cute
that T-shirt is on Gabi.

07:19.511 --> 07:22.861
Gabi... gabby me! I can't stop talking.

07:22.886 --> 07:25.282
I never noticed how blue your
eyes are. What color are mine?

07:25.307 --> 07:26.906
Red, like the devil.

07:33.928 --> 07:35.128
Oh!

07:35.218 --> 07:37.617
Maui wowie!

07:38.787 --> 07:40.455
Oh, my God.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.555
Oh! Right, they went all out.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.360
They wrote your names in flowers.

07:45.588 --> 07:47.341
Ugh. So lame, I hate it.

07:49.116 --> 07:52.930
Look, they have his and her
merman/mermaid beach towels.

07:53.235 --> 07:55.860
Amanda picked the deluxe
mer-marriage package.

07:56.838 --> 07:58.499
I miss her so much.

07:58.798 --> 08:00.132
Oh, okay.

08:00.157 --> 08:03.491
Listen, I get it, all right? What
she did to you was unforgivable.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.742
You ask her to marry
you, and she says yes,

08:05.767 --> 08:08.241
and then she leaves you standing
at the altar waiting for her

08:08.266 --> 08:11.084
because all of a
sudden, she can't commit,

08:11.109 --> 08:14.203
and then she kisses her therapist,
and she flies with her to Australia!

08:14.228 --> 08:16.358
You know what, I've
had it! Screw Amanda!

08:17.991 --> 08:20.271
- Amanda?
- No...

08:20.581 --> 08:21.781
Josh.

08:23.214 --> 08:24.414
(sighs)

08:25.398 --> 08:27.319
Oh my God, they have Jet Skis.

08:27.362 --> 08:28.810
I like Jet Skis.

08:30.436 --> 08:32.297
And a pool with a swim-up snack bar.

08:32.322 --> 08:33.937
(gasps) A swim-up snack bar?

08:33.972 --> 08:39.171
You know, I have always wanted to order
a panini and a martini in a bikini.

08:41.046 --> 08:43.095
That's just the beginning.
They have tons of stuff.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.268
Snorkeling, parasailing,

08:45.293 --> 08:47.217
- swimming with dolphins.
- (gasps)

08:47.242 --> 08:48.941
That sounds like so much fun.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.886
But do you know what
sounds like even more fun?

08:50.922 --> 08:53.749
Taking pictures of
us doing those things.

08:53.774 --> 08:55.929
Revenge pictures. Tons of 'em.

08:55.954 --> 08:58.523
And when we post them on
Instagram, and Amanda sees them,

08:58.548 --> 09:01.242
she's gonna dump Dr. Rounds,
and come crawling back!

09:01.516 --> 09:03.168
Let's do one right now.

09:03.976 --> 09:05.235
Cheese.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.460
(shutter clicks)

09:10.974 --> 09:12.873
(laughing)

09:12.898 --> 09:16.763
I've got to say, I love this
grass skirt. It's very breezy.

09:17.380 --> 09:20.231
And the picture of you in it
already has 100 likes on Instagram.

09:20.256 --> 09:21.815
But I think that's probably just because

09:21.840 --> 09:23.927
you didn't know you were
supposed to wear underwear.

09:24.325 --> 09:27.115
I know now. Thanks to that seagull.

09:28.682 --> 09:30.712
Need anything from the bar, my bride?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.680
Oh, just something old, something new,

09:32.705 --> 09:35.038
something blended, and
something blue. (chuckles)

09:35.063 --> 09:37.230
- What?
- A margarita.

09:40.635 --> 09:41.835
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:41.860 --> 09:44.717
Ooh... oh, my bad, Hawaiian Gabi.

09:45.461 --> 09:47.166
- Yolanda, it's me.
- Hmm?

09:47.353 --> 09:49.139
And you know my name.

09:49.164 --> 09:51.287
Mm... maybe these aren't as
watered down as I thought.

09:51.484 --> 09:53.991
No, Yolanda, it's really me, it's Gabi.

09:54.281 --> 09:56.945
Girl, Alo-hey!

09:57.417 --> 10:00.539
What the hell are you doing in
Hawaii at the same resort as me?

10:00.564 --> 10:03.110
Oh, well, I went to go surprise
Josh on his flight to Australia,

10:03.135 --> 10:05.352
but he was on the plane with
his therapist, so I called Sofia,

10:05.377 --> 10:07.047
and I bawled my eyes out,
and then I met this guy

10:07.072 --> 10:09.339
whose fiancée left him at the altar,
so he asked me to be his fake wife

10:09.364 --> 10:11.940
because this place is couples only,
and it's turning out to be really fun.

10:11.965 --> 10:13.330
What are you doing here?

10:14.266 --> 10:17.201
Well, Alan, Elliot, and I went
splitsies on a vacation rental,

10:17.226 --> 10:19.342
but it turned out to be a
bust, so we ended up here,

10:19.367 --> 10:21.172
but they only take
couples, so Alan, Elliot,

10:21.197 --> 10:22.736
and I are pretending to be a thrupple!

10:22.761 --> 10:25.437
Oh, haha! Well, bottoms up.

10:25.462 --> 10:27.624
Ah! That's Elliot's job.

10:35.786 --> 10:38.854
Josh, you are one photogenic man!

10:38.890 --> 10:41.879
Yeah, what can I say?
The camera does love me.

10:42.227 --> 10:43.504
I do, too.

10:43.529 --> 10:45.903
Love taking pictures.

10:45.928 --> 10:47.575
Say "dingo."

10:47.600 --> 10:49.006
Dingo!

10:49.537 --> 10:51.772
Seriously, you should post these photos.

10:51.797 --> 10:53.607
I don't know. Isn't that
a little egotistical?

10:54.100 --> 10:55.377
Okay, maybe just a few.

10:57.107 --> 10:58.540
Wow...

10:58.754 --> 11:01.395
Looks like Gabi's been
posting a lot lately.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.719
With some guy. Who is this guy? Does
that look like Hawaii? Is that Hawaii?

11:04.964 --> 11:07.675
Oh, that's the guy I saw
her get off the plane with.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.621
Little Miss Thing doesn't
waste time, does she?

11:11.020 --> 11:13.260
Gabi was on our plane?
The plane that we were on?

11:13.785 --> 11:15.910
Or someone that looked like her.

11:15.935 --> 11:17.668
Was it her? It might have been her.

11:17.693 --> 11:19.957
Could have been her... It was her.

11:20.803 --> 11:22.395
Why didn't you tell me?

11:22.420 --> 11:25.900
Because it was after you and I had made
all those plans to hang out together.

11:25.925 --> 11:27.892
Gabi was on my plane.
Why would she be...

11:28.736 --> 11:30.000
Oh, my God.

11:30.746 --> 11:32.172
She came to find me.

11:32.207 --> 11:33.923
She must have wanted to...

11:34.285 --> 11:36.350
Oh my God, she came to forgive me!

11:36.375 --> 11:39.182
Wait, why did she leave
without... Oh, my God!

11:39.654 --> 11:41.158
She must have seen us.

11:41.381 --> 11:43.199
I can't believe you
didn't say anything to me.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.499
Josh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:45.524 --> 11:47.359
You said you wanted a vacation from her.

11:47.384 --> 11:48.602
No, no, no.

11:48.627 --> 11:51.306
You said I wanted a vacation
from her. I want her.

11:52.864 --> 11:54.067
Did you hear that?

11:54.465 --> 11:55.872
"I want her." Did I
just have a breakthrough?

11:55.897 --> 11:57.356
I think I just had a breakthrough.

11:58.044 --> 12:00.503
I'm finally ready to be with Gabi.

12:00.538 --> 12:03.431
Well, congratulations.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.950
Haha. To me!

12:04.975 --> 12:06.309
My plan worked.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.221
My plan to follow you here,

12:08.246 --> 12:11.473
to kiss you, to start crying right now.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.624
It was all meant to make you
realize your true feelings for Gabi.

12:14.649 --> 12:16.574
So... you're welcome.

12:17.902 --> 12:19.765
Okay, so I'm gonna go.
Hey, good luck to you.

12:20.598 --> 12:23.062
And to you. Haha.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.642
Oh God, I need to call my therapist.

12:30.433 --> 12:33.701
(laughing) Okay, the way you
jumped when you saw that sea turtle.

12:33.726 --> 12:37.137
Listen, I assume everything is a great
white shark until proven otherwise.

12:38.774 --> 12:40.669
Adam, do you know what I had today?

12:40.815 --> 12:42.504
Five jumbo shrimp cocktails?

12:42.980 --> 12:46.547
Yes. And... fun.

12:46.582 --> 12:49.382
Me too. Do you know what my
favorite part of the day was?

12:49.417 --> 12:52.327
Lying down on the bed
and ordering room service.

12:52.863 --> 12:54.121
When did we do that?

12:54.146 --> 12:55.771
Right now. Ha!

12:57.280 --> 12:58.524
Did you see that?

12:58.549 --> 12:59.936
(chuckles) What?

12:59.961 --> 13:03.065
I just flopped onto the
bed, but it was a happy flop.

13:03.090 --> 13:06.585
An "I had an amazing day" flop.
Not a "God, I miss Amanda" flop.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.809
Hey, maybe that's why
they call it Flip Flops?

13:08.834 --> 13:09.727
(chuckles)

13:09.752 --> 13:12.429
Maybe. Probably not, but maybe.

13:13.235 --> 13:14.754
Okay. You try it.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.844
Uh-ugh!

13:17.177 --> 13:20.436
Hey, I didn't think about
Josh when I flopped either.

13:20.964 --> 13:23.457
Do you know that's the first
time you mentioned his name today?

13:23.482 --> 13:25.159
And the last.

13:25.951 --> 13:28.144
So, you're okay with just
ordering room service?

13:28.169 --> 13:31.200
- No. I wanna order a movie, too.
- Done.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.664
What do you want to eat?
I'm kinda craving a...

13:34.689 --> 13:35.955
- banana split.
- Banana split.

13:38.430 --> 13:39.729
You know what else I'm craving?

13:39.765 --> 13:41.541
- Pepperoni pizza.
- Pepperoni pizza.

13:41.994 --> 13:44.720
Oh, my God. You know what's
so great about you, Adam?

13:44.745 --> 13:46.557
Everything is so easy.

13:46.582 --> 13:48.173
- No drama.
- (chuckles)

13:48.198 --> 13:50.373
You know, this is the best
honeymoon that I've ever been on.

13:50.398 --> 13:52.003
- Me, too. (laughs)
- (laughs)

13:54.883 --> 13:56.083
Hello?

13:56.108 --> 13:57.356
(laughs)

13:57.381 --> 13:59.240
Yes, this is Mrs. Foley.

14:00.060 --> 14:03.454
Um, I'd like to order a banana split,

14:03.479 --> 14:05.465
and a pepperoni pizza,

14:06.057 --> 14:07.989
- and...
- It's okay. Go ahead.

14:08.012 --> 14:09.273
and a jumbo shrimp cocktail.

14:10.413 --> 14:12.412
Okay. Thanks.

14:13.916 --> 14:16.112
Okay, so, movie.

14:16.137 --> 14:17.671
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

14:18.486 --> 14:20.500
<i>- Frozen.
- 40-Year-Old Virgin.</i>

14:21.384 --> 14:23.299
Okay, maybe it only works with food.

14:26.339 --> 14:27.772
(knocking)

14:27.797 --> 14:29.081
- Dessert!
- Dessert!

14:33.166 --> 14:34.366
Gabi?

14:34.391 --> 14:36.829
Uh, no, actually, it's "Mrs. Foley."

14:37.152 --> 14:38.357
Amanda?

14:39.202 --> 14:40.921
Wait, no, not the Amanda that...

14:43.714 --> 14:46.284
♪ I love to live alone ♪

14:46.293 --> 14:47.524
- (phone rings)
- Oh!

14:47.549 --> 14:49.986
♪ That is my telephone ♪

14:50.011 --> 14:50.959
(ringing continues)

14:50.984 --> 14:53.264
Oh... it's Gabi.

14:53.576 --> 14:54.776
(phone rings again)

14:54.929 --> 14:57.000
Am I a bad friend if
I don't answer that?

14:57.171 --> 14:59.033
I'm just gonna suck
it up and answer that.

14:59.311 --> 15:01.286
Hey, Gabi!

15:01.647 --> 15:02.880
<i>Look at me!</i>

15:02.905 --> 15:06.075
<i>Adam's ex-fiancée showed up in
Hawaii and punched me in the face!</i>

15:06.100 --> 15:07.348
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

15:07.569 --> 15:10.420
Oh my God, Gabi, well... (sighs)

15:10.445 --> 15:12.880
I mean, I hate to be insensitive, but
what did you think was gonna happen

15:12.905 --> 15:15.436
once you started posting
provocative photos of you and Adam?

15:15.576 --> 15:17.943
Oh, okay, so this is all my fault?

15:18.483 --> 15:19.804
All I'm saying is...

15:19.828 --> 15:21.129
<i>No, no, no! You know what?</i>

15:21.802 --> 15:23.035
I'm gonna go talk to Yolanda.

15:23.060 --> 15:26.184
She's drinking at the bar,
and not in such a judgy mood.

15:28.332 --> 15:30.714
You ever get freaky in the Lazy Groove?

15:32.915 --> 15:34.118
Yolanda!

15:34.143 --> 15:37.849
You can't spend the whole time trying
to pick up married guys at the bar.

15:37.874 --> 15:39.974
Oh, watch me.

15:40.637 --> 15:43.706
If Danny finds out we're a fake
thrupple, we won't get the free nights.

15:43.731 --> 15:45.433
- Oh, fine.
- Now, come on.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.950
Elliot signed us up for volleyball.

15:46.975 --> 15:50.159
Uh, volleyball? Oh, hell no.

15:50.184 --> 15:52.312
My game is croquet.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.784
- Hey, Hawaiian Gabi.
- Hey, Hawaiian Gabi.

15:58.010 --> 15:59.963
Hey. Hey, how's it look?

15:59.988 --> 16:01.204
Much better.

16:01.229 --> 16:03.276
I can't believe you let
that girl sucker-punch you.

16:03.301 --> 16:05.846
You know what? I get why she did it.

16:05.871 --> 16:08.713
She came here to fight for
the person that she loves.

16:09.081 --> 16:11.471
I wish somebody would
fight for me like that.

16:11.496 --> 16:12.696
Mmm...

16:12.748 --> 16:14.371
Um... uh, Gabi... uh...

16:14.396 --> 16:16.512
When you want somebody,
you just know it.

16:16.537 --> 16:20.454
You know. How hard is it to say "I
want you. I want to be with you."

16:20.864 --> 16:22.064
- Gabi?
- (gasps)

16:22.089 --> 16:23.701
Oh my God, tell me you heard that, too?

16:28.490 --> 16:30.060
I want you.

16:30.854 --> 16:32.595
I need to be with you.

16:33.927 --> 16:36.706
Gabi, I'm ready.

16:36.899 --> 16:39.924
(slurping)

16:44.689 --> 16:45.955
(knocking)

16:48.602 --> 16:50.459
- Hey.
- Hello, Adam!

16:50.484 --> 16:53.866
It's just me and my three
very large Hawaiian friends

16:53.891 --> 16:56.046
who hunt sharks for a living.

16:56.747 --> 16:58.736
- Amanda's not here.
- Oh, thank God.

16:59.767 --> 17:02.555
Um, she's not coming
back any time soon, right?

17:02.798 --> 17:06.421
She broke a nail when she punched you,
so she's in the salon getting it fixed.

17:06.445 --> 17:09.021
Great. So, I will pack fast.

17:09.047 --> 17:12.803
Um, you are not gonna believe
what just happened. Um...

17:12.828 --> 17:16.330
when I was in the bar getting
ice for my cheek, Josh showed up.

17:16.356 --> 17:18.771
No way! Was Dr. Rounds with him?

17:18.797 --> 17:20.334
No, no. He was all by himself.

17:20.358 --> 17:23.237
It turns out, he didn't even
invite Dr. Rounds on his trip.

17:23.262 --> 17:24.924
She just showed up on the plane.

17:24.949 --> 17:28.730
And so he flew all the way here to tell
me he's finally ready to be with me.

17:28.755 --> 17:31.569
So we're flying back to
San Francisco. First class.

17:32.613 --> 17:34.130
That's amazing!

17:34.155 --> 17:36.701
And Amanda says she wants
to give us another try, too.

17:36.726 --> 17:37.926
Wow.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.136
You and I should have gotten
fake married weeks ago.

17:41.133 --> 17:44.937
Wow. So we both ended up
getting exactly what we wanted.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.905
I guess we did.

17:47.319 --> 17:50.052
And it wouldn't have happened
without you. Thank you, Gabi.

17:50.551 --> 17:51.887
- My pleasure.
- (chuckles)

17:52.423 --> 17:56.001
I mean, obviously Amanda and I
have a few things to work out.

17:56.026 --> 17:58.128
Abandonment issues, trust issues...

17:58.153 --> 17:59.720
Anger management issues.

18:00.751 --> 18:02.994
Lot of issues. Lot of issues.

18:03.556 --> 18:05.423
Okay, well, this is everything, so...

18:05.458 --> 18:07.007
I'm gonna get going.

18:07.032 --> 18:10.028
Right. Well, what can I say?

18:10.063 --> 18:12.731
I had a wonderful fake time, Mrs. Foley.

18:12.756 --> 18:15.348
Mr. Foley, I never had
such a good time faking it.

18:18.937 --> 18:20.614
- Ooh! Oww! Oww!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:20.639 --> 18:22.205
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

18:29.616 --> 18:31.006
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

18:31.982 --> 18:33.707
With my suitcase.

18:33.796 --> 18:35.096
Got your passport?

18:35.121 --> 18:37.348
Yeah, we're in America,
you don't need a passport.

18:42.226 --> 18:45.590
What... just... happened?

18:46.763 --> 18:49.830
Okay. Gotta go, gotta
go, gotta go, gotta go.

18:51.121 --> 18:52.321
Josh!

18:53.535 --> 18:55.270
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:55.295 --> 18:56.761
I have a surprise for you.

18:56.786 --> 18:59.551
Since we're already in Hawaii,
and it is so romantic...

18:59.576 --> 19:02.476
Shwa! Last available room.

19:02.501 --> 19:04.634
Ocean view. Right here.

19:07.483 --> 19:08.729
- Right here?
- Yeah.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.753
Oh my God, look at your
face. You're so excited!

19:18.020 --> 19:21.425
Whoa, Elliott, I didn't know
you were that good at volleyball.

19:21.450 --> 19:25.526
Please. Smacking around
white balls is my specialty.

19:25.950 --> 19:27.150
Right, Alan?

19:28.285 --> 19:31.654
I told you, I don't like it.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.511
Do you realize with three free nights,

19:35.536 --> 19:38.526
our whole stay is costing us
the same as that crappy rental?

19:38.832 --> 19:40.869
To thrupples.

19:40.894 --> 19:43.126
(All) Thrupples!

19:43.269 --> 19:47.439
Guys, the hotel would like to
commemorate your special relationship

19:47.464 --> 19:49.370
with a picture of the
three of you kissing.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.605
Oh, no!

19:51.206 --> 19:53.833
I, uh, got a cold.

19:54.647 --> 19:55.847
Achoo.

19:57.580 --> 20:01.214
You know, if I found out you were
faking it just to get the free nights,

20:01.239 --> 20:02.560
I'd have to charge you.

20:02.788 --> 20:05.044
Wait one second, mister!

20:05.069 --> 20:07.966
How dare you question the moral
integrity of this thrupple!

20:07.991 --> 20:10.122
Yeah! We're the real deal.

20:10.157 --> 20:12.635
That's right, honey.
We're a pudding parfait.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.994
Chocolate on the top,
butterscotch in the middle,

20:15.029 --> 20:17.676
and vanilla on the bottom.

20:19.113 --> 20:23.166
Oh, good. So you don't mind proving
it by kissing in the kissing booth.

20:23.191 --> 20:24.783
- Not at all.
- Our Pleasure.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.067
Where's the tequila?

20:29.729 --> 20:35.659
(camera shutter snaps)

20:37.832 --> 20:40.822
There you go, honey.
Proof is in the pudding.

20:40.847 --> 20:43.921
Vanilla, Butterscotch, let's bounce.
