00:45.179 --> 00:47.221
It's a funny thing.

00:47.556 --> 00:51.309
No matter how low you sink,
there's still a right and a wrong.

00:51.769 --> 00:54.228
And you always end up choosing.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.940
You go one way
so you can try to live with yourself.

00:58.567 --> 01:01.402
Or go the other
and still be walking around.

01:01.570 --> 01:03.946
But you're dead and you don't know it.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.364
I was coming through Texas
on my way to Mexico.

02:28.532 --> 02:30.950
I needed some time to hide out.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.453
I had spent most of my life on the dodge.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.249
Drunk or sober, I got no complaints.

02:38.417 --> 02:41.669
Even if I did get my hands dirty
on the way.

04:15.013 --> 04:16.555
Jericho.

04:16.723 --> 04:19.934
It was a jerkwater town
maybe 50 miles from the border.

04:20.310 --> 04:23.604
Dirt streets, ramshackle buildings.

04:23.772 --> 04:27.066
And one thing for sure,
you couldn't find it anywhere on the map.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.957
For the most part, I was a big-city guy.

05:25.125 --> 05:29.170
I like pavement under my feet
and bright lights after the sun goes down.

05:29.421 --> 05:30.463
I figured this burg...

05:30.630 --> 05:33.966
...was the kind of place you gassed up
the car, got something to eat.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.802
If you got stuck, maybe spent a night.

05:39.181 --> 05:41.182
Then I got a look at her.

05:41.892 --> 05:44.310
That's when all the fun started.

06:26.728 --> 06:30.523
It's not a good idea
to be looking at Mr. Doyle's girl that way.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.359
I remember a guy once told me
this is a free country.

06:33.527 --> 06:37.363
Jacko. This guy thinks it's a free country.

06:39.324 --> 06:40.699
Now you're free to go.

06:45.664 --> 06:49.667
Sheriff's office is right over there
in case you wanna complain about anything.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.674
Your light's out.

07:43.763 --> 07:47.141
I seen it. Right outside the window.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.852
You know what I'm gonna do about it?

07:50.103 --> 07:52.855
Not a goddamn thing.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.941
But I know what you ought to do.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.445
You ought to get your spare,
put it on your car...

07:59.613 --> 08:02.114
...and just drive on out of town.

08:03.074 --> 08:04.158
Ain't that right, Bob?

08:04.951 --> 08:08.370
Hmm. You gotta forgive Old Bob.
He ain't much for talk.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.835
Oh, hold it.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.754
Let me tell you something.

08:16.922 --> 08:19.840
If you're really planning
on sticking around...

08:20.133 --> 08:21.800
...don't be coming to me for help.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.427
You're on your own here.

08:23.595 --> 08:26.180
We already got a fella in the window
of the undertaker.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.098
Do yourself a favor.

08:28.266 --> 08:31.810
First thing, get a firearm.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.491
First customer I seen all week.

08:47.577 --> 08:50.496
Want a whiskey or beer?
Don't have much else to offer.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.997
Whiskey.

08:52.916 --> 08:54.458
What happened to Prohibition?

08:56.419 --> 08:58.796
We don't pay much attention to it here.

08:59.923 --> 09:03.175
- You got a phone in this place?
- Who you wanna call?

09:04.219 --> 09:05.302
My mama.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.559
Sure. We got phones.

09:12.727 --> 09:13.811
But they ain't working.

09:13.979 --> 09:16.438
You gotta have a switchboard operator
to run them.

09:17.857 --> 09:23.779
- You got electricity?
- Yeah. Got that. Runs on gas generators.

09:23.947 --> 09:26.115
Hope they stay working.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.034
Nobody left to fix them if they go bust.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.327
To tell the truth...

09:30.495 --> 09:34.248
...most of what they call decent folks
been run off.

09:34.582 --> 09:37.876
Really ain't much left here
but a ghost town.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.380
Some damn sheriff.

09:41.548 --> 09:45.301
Making a profit just staying in the middle
grafting off both sides.

09:45.468 --> 09:49.972
I think Mr. Doyle bought him off first.
Or maybe it was Strozzi.

09:50.181 --> 09:53.142
Who's Strozzi?

09:54.019 --> 09:55.936
That's the other gang here.

09:56.104 --> 09:59.106
Strozzi and the Italian fellas.

09:59.274 --> 10:02.901
Both gangs took over this town.
Run off all the regular folks.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.237
Come from the same big city.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.031
They don't like each other much.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.867
Bootleggers.

10:10.035 --> 10:13.329
You got Strozzi at the Sweetwater
and Doyle's bunch at the Alamo.

10:14.956 --> 10:18.292
They leave me be
because I stay to myself.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.252
Heh. They think I'm crazy.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.089
What the hell are you doing?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.724
Gonna go see the fellas
who wrecked my car.

10:34.142 --> 10:36.185
Have a little talk with them.

10:41.649 --> 10:44.443
I hadn't gotten a real warm reception...

10:44.611 --> 10:47.446
...but I started thinking
maybe this was my lucky day.

10:48.323 --> 10:50.657
A crook for a sheriff
and two bootlegger outfits...

10:50.825 --> 10:52.576
...that hated each other.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.580
If I played it right, I could make
some easy money and move on.

11:04.672 --> 11:06.090
Ma'am.

11:24.442 --> 11:25.818
I thought I made it clear...

11:25.985 --> 11:29.279
...who you can and can't be looking at
around here.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.158
That's Mr. Doyle's property.

11:34.536 --> 11:36.286
I came here to see you.

11:36.454 --> 11:38.747
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.583
Did you get that car of yours fixed yet?

11:44.170 --> 11:46.713
I'm running a little low on cash.

11:48.550 --> 11:51.760
I was wondering if you could maybe
help pay the damages.

11:52.387 --> 11:54.471
I guess maybe you'll have to kill me.

11:56.808 --> 11:57.891
It'll hurt if I do.

12:25.295 --> 12:29.339
Tell Mr. Doyle if he'd hired smarter guys,
none of this would've happened.

12:39.642 --> 12:43.061
It's all about booze.
Gets smuggled through here from Mexico.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.939
We're a part of a family operation
in Chicago.

12:46.107 --> 12:48.317
So what we got here
is close to a civil war.

12:48.485 --> 12:49.985
Except now we got a truce.

12:50.153 --> 12:52.362
What's my guess?
This truce ain't gonna last.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.281
Especially after Hickey gets back.

12:54.449 --> 12:55.824
That's why you're here.

12:57.035 --> 12:58.785
Who's Hickey?

12:59.162 --> 13:02.915
Hickey is Doyle's right-hand man.
He's a sweetheart, this guy.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.125
Looks like somebody carved him up
for dinner.

13:05.293 --> 13:06.710
Talks like this.

13:06.878 --> 13:08.420
Forget it. Heh.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.131
What about you? You got a name?

13:14.636 --> 13:17.387
- Smith.
- Smith. What? Smith what?

13:17.555 --> 13:19.765
- What, you got a first name?
- John.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.475
- John Smith.
- Ha.

13:21.643 --> 13:23.602
- John Smith. All right.
- That's a good one.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.271
You on the run, huh?

13:26.439 --> 13:28.023
Where you from, Mr. Smith?

13:28.441 --> 13:29.900
Back east.

13:30.109 --> 13:33.612
John Smith from back east. All right.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.198
I heard you wanted to see me.

13:36.533 --> 13:37.699
Yeah, that's right.

13:37.909 --> 13:40.827
What's the matter?
What, did I interrupt something important?

13:42.872 --> 13:44.873
She was doing her nails.

13:45.041 --> 13:48.460
Well, this is Lucy.
Yeah, she's a real nice girl.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.546
A real pretty girl. Got a big mouth...

13:50.713 --> 13:54.132
...but she's gonna keep it shut
and act very friendly now, right?

13:54.300 --> 13:57.761
Lucy, would you please take Mr. Smith
to his room?

14:02.016 --> 14:05.394
So I guess Strozzi hired himself
another bum.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.648
- You got it all figured out, do you?
- Yeah. I'm a fortune teller.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.234
Don't worry.
Working for Strozzi has its advantages.

14:12.402 --> 14:14.319
You're gonna love your room.

14:15.405 --> 14:18.323
The skirt was from just outside of Cicero.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.494
Strozzi told me he had her sent down here
to keep up his morale.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.122
It was the first time I ever heard it
called that.

14:25.290 --> 14:29.376
But try and keep it down up here, okay?
My room's right underneath.

14:29.544 --> 14:33.297
I'll try not to make too much noise
when I'm jumping up and down on the bed.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.925
Sunday dinner was a real event.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.719
Strozzi might've been small-time...

14:38.886 --> 14:42.514
...but he tried to run things like he was
somebody important back in Chicago.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.933
He had an army of 20 shooters.

14:45.101 --> 14:48.186
As far as I could see,
most of them were goofballs.

14:48.438 --> 14:50.772
It was all right out of some dime novel.

14:55.945 --> 14:57.696
You don't like pretty girls, huh?

14:59.449 --> 15:01.283
- How's the food?
- Good.

15:02.827 --> 15:06.538
I brought these mamas in from Chicago.
Food here is terrible.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.707
It's good, huh?

15:09.167 --> 15:11.376
- Yeah. I like garlic.
- All right.

15:24.057 --> 15:27.476
- What is this? Nobody waits?
- You're late.

15:27.644 --> 15:30.729
- I had important business.
- While you were doing...

15:30.897 --> 15:33.690
...your important business,
things are happening.

15:33.858 --> 15:38.945
We now have a new employee.
Mr. Smith, this is Giorgio Carmonte.

15:39.906 --> 15:43.408
He killed Finn.
That's Doyle's best guy next to Hickey.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.452
No!

15:46.037 --> 15:47.371
I know all about it.

15:47.538 --> 15:49.122
And you hire him?
- Yeah.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.417
What do you think that looks like to Doyle
in keeping the truce?

15:52.585 --> 15:55.379
You wanna tip Doyle off?
Plus, who the hell is he?

15:55.588 --> 15:57.506
Doyle's guys are scared of him.

15:57.674 --> 15:59.925
He was in town 20 minutes,
he killed one of them.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.095
Doyle ain't gonna do a goddamn thing
with Hickey out of town.

16:03.262 --> 16:06.973
The only thing that cockroach might try
is to hire this guy for himself.

16:07.141 --> 16:10.686
Yeah, well, I don't like it.
I don't like changes at the last minute.

16:10.853 --> 16:12.646
And I don't like new faces...

16:19.195 --> 16:22.572
You got a problem with me, Giorgio,
you take it up with your boss.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.533
I just work here.

16:35.002 --> 16:38.046
So I decided to give up my free room.

16:38.840 --> 16:42.509
I had seen the real thing
and these guys were a long way from it.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.558
I wasn't sure
if he was getting a box ready for me...

16:49.726 --> 16:52.853
...or if he just wanted to say thanks
for the business.

17:01.696 --> 17:03.196
Well, look who's here.

17:05.907 --> 17:09.286
Last time I saw you
you was gonna have a talk with some fellas.

17:09.454 --> 17:11.954
Next thing I hear, one of them is dead.

17:12.123 --> 17:14.624
Conversation sort of went downhill.

17:17.753 --> 17:19.755
Ain't that right, Bob?

17:24.176 --> 17:26.636
He don't talk much.
But his ears work good.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.976
You got a room you could rent me?

17:33.144 --> 17:36.521
Surprised you ain't staying
with your friends at the Sweetwater.

17:36.731 --> 17:40.025
There's a room upstairs.
Tell you the truth, I can use the money.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.902
You got a name?

17:42.361 --> 17:44.112
Mine is Joe.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.240
Okay, Joe.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.745
You let me know when this runs out.
I'll give you some more.

17:51.913 --> 17:53.246
Yes, sir.

17:53.414 --> 17:57.125
- Got girls for hire in this town?
- Hell, yes.

17:57.335 --> 17:59.544
You're in West Texas.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.465
Round the corner. Third door on the left.

18:05.176 --> 18:07.385
You can certainly afford them.

18:15.812 --> 18:18.355
You remind me of this guy
that used to come see me...

18:18.523 --> 18:20.065
...when I worked in New Orleans.

18:20.233 --> 18:23.318
He looked a lot like you.
You ever been to New Orleans?

18:23.945 --> 18:27.781
He was nice.
He wasn't as quiet as you, though.

18:27.949 --> 18:29.741
But you two almost look like brothers.

18:29.909 --> 18:36.623
Except he had tattoos.
I think that he was in the Navy, but...

18:36.791 --> 18:41.545
No. And he used to come and see me
every Friday or Saturday night.

18:41.712 --> 18:44.130
His name was Clarence.

18:44.549 --> 18:47.551
I had a lot of fun in New Orleans.

18:48.636 --> 18:53.265
Sorry I ever came to this lousy town.
There's nothing to do here.

18:53.432 --> 18:56.935
I'd take every dance class imaginable...

18:57.103 --> 19:00.438
...because I wanted to be a dancer...

19:00.606 --> 19:02.899
...and so I came here because it's off... Aah!

19:26.340 --> 19:28.758
Let's go!
Hurry up. Let's get out of here, man.

19:29.176 --> 19:30.719
- Move! Move!
- Go! Go!

19:30.887 --> 19:33.513
Come on! Get out of the way!

19:50.156 --> 19:52.032
I didn't do it.
- What?

19:52.199 --> 19:54.409
- I didn't have nothing to do...
- Who set me up?

19:54.577 --> 19:55.994
- Who?
- They forced me!

19:56.162 --> 19:58.872
They said they'd kill me.
I didn't have no choice.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.582
Give me a name.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.375
Give me a name, goddamn it.

20:02.543 --> 20:04.377
A guy that works for Doyle.

20:04.545 --> 20:06.963
It was Doyle's bunch.

20:07.131 --> 20:10.008
- Please don't tell them I told you.
- Shut up!

20:11.010 --> 20:13.553
Please, I'm sorry.

20:13.721 --> 20:15.889
Her name was Wanda.

20:16.599 --> 20:19.100
Crossing me was nothing personal.

20:19.268 --> 20:23.021
She was just trying to make a living
in a world where big fish eat little fish.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.898
Come on.

20:25.399 --> 20:28.902
By the time the law showed up,
I was long gone...

20:29.236 --> 20:31.571
...but the sheriff didn't let me down.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.240
He investigated the whole thing...

20:34.408 --> 20:36.576
...then arrested the hooker.

20:39.747 --> 20:43.083
I went down to the Red Bird,
asked that old geezer who runs the place...

20:43.250 --> 20:44.709
...where I could find you.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.628
Where are we headed?

20:47.088 --> 20:48.463
A juke joint outside of town.

20:48.631 --> 20:51.091
Strozzi wants everybody there.

20:51.425 --> 20:53.635
Is he gonna make another speech?

20:53.803 --> 20:56.054
He don't keep me too well-informed.

20:56.597 --> 20:58.431
Giorgio's acting like he's in charge...

20:58.599 --> 21:02.060
...because he's the son of somebody
important, Strozzi's boss in Chicago.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.562
Strozzi and Giorgio are really cousins.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.648
Strozzi don't admit it, though.

21:07.191 --> 21:09.234
Not a family man.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.027
Where does that leave you and him?

21:15.241 --> 21:18.785
Slim's was a fast 20 minutes
out across the desert.

21:18.953 --> 21:21.955
Two stories of wood
in the middle of nowhere.

21:22.123 --> 21:26.251
It was the kind of place that looked like
the special was chicken-fried steak.

21:27.545 --> 21:29.587
Strozzi told me Giorgio
and the other guys...

21:29.755 --> 21:32.632
...got a real hot head
about the kind of money you're getting.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.885
Giorgio don't like you too much,
in case you haven't noticed.

21:36.053 --> 21:39.347
Why does a guy send his girlfriend
to come find me?

21:40.141 --> 21:45.061
Strozzi figures I wouldn't be dumb enough
to do anything out of line, so he sent me.

21:45.980 --> 21:48.314
Well, that must make you feel real proud.

21:48.482 --> 21:50.442
Quit being a shitheel, all right?

21:50.609 --> 21:53.695
I get enough of that from Strozzi,
thank you.

21:54.071 --> 21:57.282
You sure you're not dumb enough
to do anything out of line?

21:58.617 --> 22:00.577
I'm just curious.

22:00.745 --> 22:03.163
Your boyfriend got a first name?

22:03.914 --> 22:05.415
Yeah.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.084
But only in the bedroom.

22:11.297 --> 22:14.007
As usual, she was trying to act tough...

22:14.175 --> 22:16.718
...but anybody could see
it was paper-thin.

22:16.886 --> 22:20.472
Even with a second-rater like Strozzi,
she was in way over her head.

22:34.904 --> 22:37.822
Well, for Christ's sweet sake,
it took you two long enough.

22:39.575 --> 22:40.867
Kiss my ass.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.829
It's raining outside, Giorgio.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.247
Hard to drive in the rain.

22:46.916 --> 22:50.168
Like he said, what took you so long?

22:50.336 --> 22:52.837
Maybe you don't hear too good.
It's raining.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.339
- Uhn!
- You know...

22:54.507 --> 22:57.467
...you're getting to be more
of a wise-ass Polack every day...

22:57.635 --> 22:59.427
...and it ain't so cute no more.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.888
You know what happens
to wise-ass Polack dames?

23:02.056 --> 23:04.641
They get their wise asses kicked.

23:07.728 --> 23:10.980
When I was in this whorehouse,
Doyle sent a couple guys to visit me.

23:13.943 --> 23:18.071
- I had to kill them both.
- You killed two more of Doyle's guys?

23:18.239 --> 23:20.156
Is that bullshit or is that true?

23:20.324 --> 23:22.826
Look, I don't give a damn about Doyle.

23:22.993 --> 23:25.411
If he lost two men tonight,
that's good news.

23:26.330 --> 23:29.916
This Doyle, he's trying to outbid me
with my own suppliers. The mick bastard.

23:30.084 --> 23:32.544
Yeah, I try to do business with him,
it's bullshit.

23:33.546 --> 23:36.965
Now, we got a shipment coming in
from Monterrey next week.

23:37.133 --> 23:40.718
Mr. Doyle has got one coming in
tomorrow.

23:40.886 --> 23:44.430
This is where you're gonna start
to earn your pay.

23:54.775 --> 23:58.653
There's five trucks.
Maybe 200 cases.

23:58.821 --> 24:02.907
We deliver at 200 bucks a case.
That's 200 grand in our books.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.160
Plus,
you know what's really the frosting?

24:05.327 --> 24:07.537
We get Doyle's trucks.

24:07.705 --> 24:11.249
You know how hard it is
to buy a truck in Mexico?

24:19.884 --> 24:22.969
We crossed the border
a couple hours before dawn.

24:23.137 --> 24:25.763
Strozzi had a plan he thought
would make him look good...

24:25.931 --> 24:28.099
...to the big boss back in Chicago.

24:28.267 --> 24:32.896
It involved hijacking, murder,
corruption of the military...

24:33.063 --> 24:35.481
...and sticking me right out front.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.365
Who in the hell are you supposed to be?

24:44.533 --> 24:46.784
This might be a good time for you guys
to give up.

24:55.336 --> 24:57.754
- What is this?
- Told you we couldn't trust Mexicans.

24:58.380 --> 25:01.799
I'm gonna send Smith back with Santo
to keep an eye on Doyle.

25:01.967 --> 25:05.261
You stay with the trucks
till they get to Matamoros.

25:23.864 --> 25:25.907
It was a massacre.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.910
Couldn't say I was real sorry...

25:29.078 --> 25:31.746
...but it was a rough way to check out.

25:36.293 --> 25:40.129
Now, I don't know how reliable
she's ever gonna hold up as a witness.

25:40.297 --> 25:41.631
She's some kind of a vagrant.

25:41.799 --> 25:44.008
Might even be here for immoral purposes.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.135
How much to get her out?

25:46.303 --> 25:49.389
Well, a hundred will send her on her way
right away.

25:49.556 --> 25:53.309
I've been thinking about how Doyle's men
knew I was at that whorehouse.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.813
I figure your deputy here
heard me last night at the Red Bird...

25:56.981 --> 26:00.566
...came over here and told you about it
and you sold the information to Doyle.

26:00.734 --> 26:03.152
How am I doing so far, sheriff?

26:03.821 --> 26:07.991
You are one suspicious fella.
Ain't he, Bob?

26:08.158 --> 26:10.702
Maybe I was a little rough on you
last night.

26:10.869 --> 26:13.037
Maybe I shortchanged you.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.331
If I was you, I'd get out of here.

26:16.125 --> 26:18.418
Doyle's men are gonna think
you tipped me off.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.005
You got a bus comes through this town?

26:22.172 --> 26:24.882
Yeah, at noon, every day.

26:28.846 --> 26:30.388
Make sure she gets on it.

26:30.556 --> 26:33.474
I got some information you may wanna sell
to Mr. Doyle.

26:33.642 --> 26:37.520
He's gonna find out soon enough,
but you might be the one to give it to him.

26:37.688 --> 26:42.233
A shipment of booze he had coming up from
Mexico got hijacked by some bandidos.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.570
Tip like that ought to be worth
at least a grand.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.405
You better be right...

26:47.573 --> 26:51.075
...because if Doyle should send Hickey
after me...

26:51.243 --> 26:53.745
...he's coming directly for you.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.621
I keep hearing about Hickey.

26:55.789 --> 26:57.540
Sounds like a real scary guy.

26:57.875 --> 27:00.251
Let me tell you just how scary.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.754
It goes that when he was 10 years old...

27:03.088 --> 27:08.885
...gets a butcher knife
and cuts his father's throat from ear to ear.

27:09.053 --> 27:13.097
Then they stick him in an orphanage.
Fifteen years old, he burns it to the ground.

27:13.390 --> 27:14.599
Heh.

27:14.808 --> 27:18.436
You just make sure you mark me down
for half of that thousand.

27:26.362 --> 27:27.945
Think maybe you and I should talk.

27:28.739 --> 27:31.449
I don't think these people appreciate you.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.998
You gonna be my hero?

27:39.333 --> 27:42.543
I thought you were just a guy
who did things for money.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.128
Yeah.

27:44.671 --> 27:47.340
I'm just a guy that does everything
for money.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.136
Anybody see you come up here?

27:52.304 --> 27:53.638
No.

27:57.810 --> 27:58.851
Appreciate me?

27:59.019 --> 28:00.770
You don't know the half of it.

28:00.938 --> 28:04.482
Let me tell you, I don't have to take it
from these bastards.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.485
Going back to Chicago
on the first thing out of here that moves.

28:09.071 --> 28:10.947
What's so funny?

28:11.115 --> 28:13.157
You're not going anywhere.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.743
You're just blowing off a little steam.

28:16.161 --> 28:19.664
Oh, yeah?
You hear the way Strozzi talked to me?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.207
That grease ball?

28:21.375 --> 28:22.500
To hell with him.

28:22.668 --> 28:25.545
You know, Strozzi's out of town
for the day.

28:26.004 --> 28:28.339
- So is Giorgio.
- So?

28:28.507 --> 28:31.384
Did Strozzi tell you he's paying me
a lot of money?

28:32.428 --> 28:35.763
Well, there may be a way for you
to get your hands on some of it.

28:37.808 --> 28:40.726
You gonna tell me why you would do
such a nice thing?

28:41.353 --> 28:43.396
Because I'm a nice guy...

28:43.856 --> 28:45.022
...a sweet guy.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.859
Yeah, right.

28:52.823 --> 28:54.615
Like I said...

28:55.659 --> 28:57.743
...I don't think they appreciate you.

28:59.329 --> 29:02.290
See, I think you're a very smart girl.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.543
You hear things...

29:05.711 --> 29:07.712
...the inside word.

29:09.256 --> 29:11.382
I'm the kind of guy...

29:11.758 --> 29:14.886
...that likes to have all the information
he can get...

29:18.056 --> 29:20.641
...so if you give me the inside word...

29:21.059 --> 29:23.978
...I'll give you an extra hundred or so
a week...

29:24.813 --> 29:26.439
...just between me and you.

29:35.073 --> 29:38.701
Strozzi and Giorgio
were gonna be back the next day.

29:39.203 --> 29:43.456
I smelled the real money was gonna come
from working Doyle's side of the street.

29:43.624 --> 29:45.791
They'd make the first move.

29:52.758 --> 29:56.219
Mr. Doyle wants you to come work for us
full-time.

29:56.386 --> 29:58.304
I'm not sure he can afford it.

29:58.472 --> 29:59.764
Try me.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.974
A thousand dollars.

30:02.142 --> 30:05.269
A week or a day?

30:07.105 --> 30:09.440
I'm surprised you're not mad at me.

30:11.735 --> 30:15.571
I thought you might hold it against me,
me killing three of your guys.

30:16.490 --> 30:19.325
It's the only cure I know for being stupid.

30:20.786 --> 30:21.786
Hey, dummy!

30:23.121 --> 30:24.497
Bring us your best stuff.

30:24.665 --> 30:27.875
Yes, sir, Mr. Doyle.
Right away, sir.

30:32.339 --> 30:36.342
I know you already got a job
working for Strozzi...

30:36.510 --> 30:40.388
...but I figure you for the kind of guy
that goes to the highest bidder...

30:40.556 --> 30:44.976
...just like those Mexicans
that were supposed to guard my booze.

30:48.438 --> 30:51.148
Strozzi was behind that, wasn't he?

30:54.319 --> 30:58.990
How would you like to kill Strozzi
and that little punk Giorgio?

31:00.158 --> 31:03.703
From what I hear, a guy like yourself...

31:03.870 --> 31:06.163
...you only care about the money, right?

31:07.416 --> 31:09.250
I mean it as a compliment.

31:09.418 --> 31:10.835
That's why we're all here.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.837
Where's Hickey?

31:14.089 --> 31:16.507
You heard about Hickey, huh?

31:17.301 --> 31:19.135
I heard he talks kind of funny.

31:19.303 --> 31:24.056
Yeah, well, that's the way you sound
when somebody slices your face...

31:24.224 --> 31:27.977
...jams an ice pick in your voice box.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.983
Hickey can get awful messy, though.

31:34.276 --> 31:36.819
This should be an inside job.

31:36.987 --> 31:40.323
We need somebody nice and neat
like you.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.119
I'll think about it.

31:45.871 --> 31:47.705
You're making a mistake!

31:49.583 --> 31:51.876
Maybe you're just not very smart.

31:52.252 --> 31:54.462
What the hell are you holding back for?

31:54.630 --> 31:57.715
You think the meek are gonna inherit
the Earth?

31:58.425 --> 32:01.010
If they do,
you won't be there to enjoy it.

32:04.723 --> 32:09.727
I might have been a gun for hire,
but I wasn't exactly an assassin.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.229
Maybe Doyle figured
there wasn't much difference.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.607
Tell Hickey I say hello.

32:15.901 --> 32:20.237
If I was going to get into Doyle's wallet,
I needed something big to sell him.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.995
Ha-ha. You don't quit me.

32:28.163 --> 32:31.666
Nobody quits me. What is it? Doyle?
What did he do? He offer you more money?

32:31.833 --> 32:33.584
Keep the 500 you owe me.

32:33.752 --> 32:37.004
The rest is mine for the work I did
down in Mexico.

32:38.298 --> 32:41.842
- You let him walk away? Nobody goes.
- We don't need you. Never.

32:42.010 --> 32:44.095
You get back here,
you yellow son of a bitch.

32:47.516 --> 32:49.475
- Get him, now.
- Put those down!

32:49.643 --> 32:51.102
Berto. Smith.

32:53.063 --> 32:56.649
Something you wanna say to me, Giorgio,
huh?

33:02.280 --> 33:03.447
Fucking kill you, bastard.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.457
It's not your fault Giorgio's a halfwit.

33:15.168 --> 33:17.837
You really wanna get killed
for a halfwit?

33:23.218 --> 33:24.468
Let it go.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.262
Put it down.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.281
Hey.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.492
Tell Mr. Doyle I turned Strozzi down.

34:04.050 --> 34:05.801
What the hell you grinning about?

34:05.969 --> 34:07.511
Goddamn, that was great.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.346
I guess you don't work for Strozzi
no more.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.938
You ever wash these, Joe?

34:27.949 --> 34:31.534
Working for Strozzi
had about played itself out.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.955
Until Hickey showed up,
I was out of moves.

34:35.123 --> 34:37.541
I decided to dry out a little.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.960
Went two days without a drink.

34:40.128 --> 34:42.295
For me, that's pretty good.

34:47.385 --> 34:51.138
You know, sitting out here in the open
just might not be a real good idea...

34:51.306 --> 34:54.266
...for a fella that's got
as many enemies as you got.

34:55.268 --> 34:56.893
I thought everybody liked me.

34:57.687 --> 34:59.897
I'm such a nice guy.

35:02.818 --> 35:05.194
This is Mr. Doyle's girl.

35:06.488 --> 35:08.239
I'm bringing her back from church.

35:10.367 --> 35:13.869
Going to church makes her feel better
about keeping company with Mr. Doyle.

35:15.288 --> 35:17.081
That right, honey?

35:21.086 --> 35:23.671
You don't wanna miss out
on the big money.

35:24.381 --> 35:28.259
This little war with Strozzi's
gonna be over soon.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.276
Hickey's back.

35:57.205 --> 35:58.956
McCOOL:
We got problems.

35:59.541 --> 36:02.960
Strozzi broke the truce,
hit our trucks in Mexico...

36:03.128 --> 36:05.004
...killed all our guys...

36:05.171 --> 36:06.463
...jacked the whole load.

36:16.433 --> 36:19.018
Hey. How's my car?

36:19.185 --> 36:22.229
Oh, I fixed that inner tube
and I fixed that headlight.

36:22.397 --> 36:25.316
She's good as new,
except for that windshield.

36:25.483 --> 36:28.736
I ordered new glass,
but it's gonna take a while.

36:30.655 --> 36:31.739
Will this cover it?

36:31.907 --> 36:34.783
Twenty dollars? That's way too much.

36:35.493 --> 36:39.163
But I got some information I'll trade you
for the change on it.

36:39.915 --> 36:42.583
A fella come around here
asking me about your car...

36:42.751 --> 36:45.586
...wanted to look at the registration
and check your name.

36:45.754 --> 36:47.838
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.674
He just went on ahead
and looked anyway.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.676
But guess what.

36:53.261 --> 36:56.680
- He didn't find that registration, did he?
- That's right. Heh.

36:57.182 --> 36:59.183
You can keep that change.

36:59.351 --> 37:03.687
- This fella say what his name was?
- He didn't say, but I know who it was.

37:03.855 --> 37:09.610
One of them Italian boys
been hanging around town named Giorgio.

37:10.904 --> 37:12.363
Thanks.

37:27.837 --> 37:30.047
All right, so come on.

37:30.215 --> 37:32.132
Jesus Christ!

37:32.300 --> 37:34.510
Somebody answer the goddamn phone!

37:34.678 --> 37:38.180
Maybe Chicago found a way
to get through. Yeah?

37:39.057 --> 37:40.849
Ah. Looks like I struck pay dirt.

37:41.017 --> 37:42.393
Who's this? Giorgio?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.770
Yeah. Who's this?

37:44.938 --> 37:46.814
You remember me.

37:46.982 --> 37:48.565
The high-paid nobody.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.734
I got a message for Strozzi.

37:50.902 --> 37:54.363
Yeah, well, we don't need any messages
from jerks like you, all right?

37:54.531 --> 37:58.659
Don't be stupid. Just because I don't work
for you doesn't mean I can't be a friend.

37:58.827 --> 38:00.536
I don't wanna see your boss get hurt.

38:01.913 --> 38:06.667
Yeah. You tell him that Doyle knows that
he's the one that hijacked his shipment...

38:07.460 --> 38:09.586
...but maybe you got a bigger problem.

38:09.754 --> 38:13.340
There's a rumor Ramirez is gonna go back
on Doyle's payroll.

38:13.508 --> 38:17.177
Who knows? Maybe it's all just bullshit.
You getting this, Giorgio?

38:17.345 --> 38:18.971
Yeah, I'm getting it.

38:19.139 --> 38:20.389
All bullshit.

38:20.849 --> 38:22.850
Yeah, good boy.

38:23.309 --> 38:25.769
You tell your cousin to watch his ass.

38:32.736 --> 38:35.195
The Italians were winning
in New York and Chicago...

38:35.780 --> 38:37.865
...but they weren't doing too good
in Jericho.

38:38.033 --> 38:41.577
I don't care who said what, just
take care of those cases before I get back.

38:41.745 --> 38:45.581
A little past 9 that night,
I got a look at Giorgio leaving town.

38:45.749 --> 38:49.084
You could almost see the price tag
hanging around his neck.

38:57.552 --> 39:01.013
I just came by to tell you that me
and Strozzi made it up this morning.

39:01.181 --> 39:02.473
I got an investment there...

39:02.640 --> 39:06.977
...so we can forget about the other day
like it never happened, right?

39:07.687 --> 39:10.814
I mean,
it was just one time for fun, right?

39:14.736 --> 39:16.653
Business is business.

39:16.821 --> 39:19.823
I don't wanna get myself
in the middle of anything here.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.659
Strozzi's gonna take care of me.

39:27.207 --> 39:29.750
I saw that punk Giorgio
sneak out of town.

39:29.918 --> 39:31.001
Where's he headed?

39:31.503 --> 39:33.712
He went to El Mirado.

39:34.047 --> 39:35.839
What's he doing down in Mexico?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.382
What he always does.

39:37.550 --> 39:40.594
Drinks, messes around,
goes to whorehouses.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.931
I'm surprised Strozzi didn't go.

39:44.099 --> 39:47.267
- He must be getting pretty used to whores.
- Goddamn you.

39:48.770 --> 39:50.229
What?

39:53.149 --> 39:55.567
I think you're forgetting about our deal.

39:56.778 --> 40:01.115
Now, why did Giorgio go to Mexico?

40:06.162 --> 40:09.915
He went to finish doing
some business with Ramirez.

40:12.168 --> 40:16.672
Pay him off,
and the cop they got for security.

40:19.008 --> 40:20.717
I gotta go.

40:23.763 --> 40:25.973
We're quits now, right?

40:28.059 --> 40:29.768
We're quits.

40:35.441 --> 40:37.734
That mouthy little cousin
of Strozzi's, Giorgio...

40:37.902 --> 40:40.612
...he's on his way down to Mexico,
see a friend of yours.

40:40.780 --> 40:42.573
Fella named Ramirez.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.200
You know a guy named Ramirez, do you?

40:45.368 --> 40:47.911
Gonna pay him back for the hijack.

40:48.246 --> 40:51.165
- How do you like the story so far?
- Good. Keep talking.

40:51.332 --> 40:53.083
He's gonna see a cop down there too.

40:53.251 --> 40:56.628
This cop's responsibility was security
on this side of the border.

40:56.796 --> 40:58.255
I guess he's gonna get paid too.

40:58.423 --> 41:02.551
They're probably all planning
their next shipment. Gonna use your trucks.

41:03.303 --> 41:04.845
You know...

41:06.306 --> 41:07.848
...I don't want to be pushy...

41:08.016 --> 41:11.727
...but this kind of information's
a little too valuable to be given away.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.689
Giorgio's very important to Strozzi.

41:15.857 --> 41:18.192
If something were to happen to him...

41:19.027 --> 41:22.279
...it would be very bad for Strozzi,
don't you think?

41:26.534 --> 41:28.619
Take as much as you want.

41:28.786 --> 41:30.329
You work for me now.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.498
I'll just take the 2000 we agreed upon.

41:34.167 --> 41:36.543
You work with us,
you work with the winners.

41:37.045 --> 41:39.546
Anything else is stupid.

41:41.466 --> 41:43.175
I'll think about it.

41:47.472 --> 41:50.140
What are you holding back for?
I don't play this style.

41:50.308 --> 41:53.060
What the hell are you holding back for?

41:57.523 --> 41:59.483
His name's Smith.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.985
At least that's what he says.

42:05.615 --> 42:07.324
This is Hickey.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.909
I told you about him.

42:10.161 --> 42:12.162
He told me all about you.

42:13.456 --> 42:16.333
Been hearing about you
all over town, actually.

42:17.126 --> 42:20.045
I especially like that orphanage story.

42:20.380 --> 42:24.341
He tell you about all them little kids
burning up like candles?

42:25.009 --> 42:26.301
My favorite part.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.180
You shot some of our guys.

42:31.307 --> 42:33.267
I guess I did.

42:34.143 --> 42:35.894
The ones that deserved it.

42:36.062 --> 42:38.855
Well, you got Finn.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.941
He's Doyle's best shooter.

42:42.986 --> 42:44.361
I thought you were the best.

42:44.862 --> 42:47.364
No, just the best-looking.

42:47.907 --> 42:50.534
Enough of this bullshit!

42:50.910 --> 42:52.452
This game is finished.

42:52.620 --> 42:55.289
Come on. We gotta talk.

42:58.251 --> 43:00.460
I guess you better go talk.

43:02.046 --> 43:03.547
Yeah.

43:08.428 --> 43:10.262
Don't believe everything you hear.

43:23.609 --> 43:27.571
El Mirado was about 30 miles
across the Rio Grande.

43:28.239 --> 43:31.491
The whole town
was celebrating some saint's day...

43:31.659 --> 43:34.369
...which meant everybody
was either drunk...

43:34.537 --> 43:35.912
...or working on it.

43:39.917 --> 43:43.670
Doyle took my bait and sent a car
due south the next morning.

43:44.213 --> 43:47.924
You didn't have to be real smart
to guess who the passenger was.

44:46.067 --> 44:47.401
No, thanks.

45:22.728 --> 45:24.438
Looks to me you're a cop.

45:24.730 --> 45:26.648
You wearing a gun, Red?

45:27.191 --> 45:28.233
Yes, sir.

45:28.693 --> 45:30.318
That's good.

45:30.695 --> 45:34.865
Maybe you're the kind of guy
that'd shoot an unarmed man in the back.

45:41.873 --> 45:43.748
Make your play.

45:57.054 --> 45:59.556
We're taking you out of here, Giorgio.

46:01.517 --> 46:02.809
Just don't shoot me.

46:02.977 --> 46:06.730
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.334
She looks like her mother.

46:27.502 --> 46:30.086
It's all right. He's asleep.

46:31.923 --> 46:34.758
I parked a couple miles from here
and walked in.

46:35.259 --> 46:37.260
Why do you come out here?

46:39.972 --> 46:42.349
Doyle lets me be alone here.

46:43.768 --> 46:46.603
It's the only place they don't watch me.

46:48.606 --> 46:50.398
Why do you stay with him?

46:50.816 --> 46:53.109
People don't own other people.

46:53.486 --> 46:57.989
A year ago, my husband gambled
with Mr. Doyle.

46:58.324 --> 47:01.952
After he lost me,
he went back across the border.

47:02.119 --> 47:03.954
He was ashamed.

47:07.250 --> 47:10.585
When Doyle took me from my daughter...

47:12.838 --> 47:14.631
...I went to sleep.

47:19.011 --> 47:22.514
All I had left was to pray.

47:31.065 --> 47:33.650
My fear is my curse.

47:35.486 --> 47:37.279
What's yours?

47:40.658 --> 47:43.201
I was born without a conscience.

47:47.915 --> 47:51.585
There's a fella here
come to see you.

47:51.752 --> 47:55.380
John Smith, meet Captain Tom Pickett.

47:55.548 --> 47:58.049
He is the head ranger here in my district.

47:58.217 --> 48:00.176
He generally just comes down when...

48:00.344 --> 48:03.221
Shut up, Galt. Sit down, Mr. Smith.

48:07.643 --> 48:11.688
Now, sheriff, Mr. Smith and I
are gonna have a drink.

48:11.939 --> 48:14.774
We got a lot to talk about tonight.

48:15.735 --> 48:17.861
I'm here about a murdered policeman.

48:18.029 --> 48:22.115
Got himself killed other side of the river
in some crumby little Mexican town.

48:22.283 --> 48:24.868
Few locals killed too...

48:25.202 --> 48:29.331
...and a double dealing comandante
named Ramirez.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.836
But the man I'm concerned about
was an American on the border patrol.

48:35.004 --> 48:38.048
Had a family.
Well-liked by his brother officers.

48:38.215 --> 48:40.383
He strayed a little bit
in some departments...

48:40.551 --> 48:43.553
...but he was an officer of the law
just the same.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.931
You know anything about his death, son?

48:49.060 --> 48:52.395
- No, I don't think so.
That's odd.

48:52.855 --> 48:54.898
Don't hardly seem possible.

48:55.066 --> 48:59.235
Mr. Galt here says you're real well-informed
on what happens around here.

49:00.738 --> 49:02.781
You saying I did it?

49:03.574 --> 49:06.576
I asked if you knew anything about it,
not if you did it.

49:06.744 --> 49:11.665
The crime has been solved, son. Mexican
police picked up two armed drifters...

49:11.832 --> 49:15.085
...from the state of Florida
across the border. Handed them over.

49:15.252 --> 49:17.921
They ain't confessed yet, but they will.

49:19.131 --> 49:21.216
I just can't get past the idea...

49:21.384 --> 49:25.679
...that maybe one of these two bootleg
gangs had something to do with it.

49:26.263 --> 49:29.974
I learned a long time ago
to trust my instincts.

49:30.267 --> 49:33.395
Now listen real careful,
because here is the point, son.

49:33.562 --> 49:36.564
Things in this town are out of control.

49:36.732 --> 49:40.485
Two gangs is just one too many.

49:40.820 --> 49:42.570
I'm not an idealist.

49:42.738 --> 49:46.449
I know a lot of things that people do
are awful low...

49:46.617 --> 49:49.494
...but that's between them and God.

49:50.079 --> 49:52.205
Do you believe in God?

49:53.207 --> 49:55.709
I believe in God, son.

49:56.627 --> 49:59.629
But what I'm concerned with
is keeping a lid on things.

49:59.797 --> 50:03.967
And what we got here in Jericho
is just way out of hand.

50:04.135 --> 50:06.970
And Sheriff Galt here,
he can't do much about it, right?

50:07.138 --> 50:11.266
Matter of fact, it might be fair to say
he's part of the problem, right?

50:11.517 --> 50:15.812
Now, you been going back and forth playing
both sides according to Mr. Galt here.

50:15.980 --> 50:18.982
Making yourself a lot of money
out of all this.

50:19.150 --> 50:21.776
Well, it's over, son.

50:22.319 --> 50:24.696
I'm coming back here in 10 days.

50:24.864 --> 50:28.658
I'm gonna bring
about 20 rangers with me.

50:28.826 --> 50:32.454
I will tolerate one gang
because that is the nature of things.

50:32.621 --> 50:35.123
A certain amount of corruption
is inevitable.

50:35.291 --> 50:37.751
But if I find two gangs here
when I get back...

50:37.918 --> 50:41.337
...then in a couple of hours,
there will be no gangs here.

50:43.424 --> 50:45.008
So it's simple.

50:45.176 --> 50:47.177
One gang quits and goes home.

50:48.846 --> 50:52.015
You boys work it out.
I don't give a damn which one.

50:52.183 --> 50:56.728
Just so long as one side leaves,
or maybe one side loses.

50:57.104 --> 51:00.857
That's fine too, son.
Kill as many as you want.

51:01.025 --> 51:03.359
Just don't kill no innocent people
around here.

51:03.527 --> 51:05.528
I wouldn't like that.

51:10.367 --> 51:12.452
Been real nice talking to you, captain.

51:13.037 --> 51:17.707
Likewise, son. Only one more thing.

51:19.460 --> 51:23.171
When I come back, if I was you...

51:23.714 --> 51:25.298
...I'd be gone.

51:41.857 --> 51:44.067
You tell Strozzi we got his boy Giorgio.

51:44.235 --> 51:48.571
Tell him he wants him back to bring 100
thou to the crossing at the five-mile road.

51:48.739 --> 51:51.741
- Tell him to make it 3 in the afternoon.
- The trucks.

51:51.909 --> 51:55.870
Oh, yeah. And we'll give youse two days
to give us our trucks back.

52:12.972 --> 52:15.431
All the vultures showed up
for the exchange.

52:16.141 --> 52:20.311
If I was honest, I guess
I'd have to include myself in the roll call.

52:20.479 --> 52:23.940
But if there was a hundred grand
being handed over for Giorgio...

52:24.108 --> 52:26.776
...I wanted to take a real good look
at it.

52:29.113 --> 52:30.947
Stick around.

52:45.629 --> 52:48.131
You get the briefcase,
you let go of the rope.

53:05.316 --> 53:06.691
Don't shoot. They got Giorgio.

53:12.698 --> 53:14.908
We're even now. You got one choice.

53:15.075 --> 53:17.535
- Give up your whole operation.
- Santo.

53:27.463 --> 53:29.380
Son of a bitch.

53:29.548 --> 53:33.051
Until I get Giorgio back,
she stays with me.

53:33.218 --> 53:36.054
And I guess you know what I'm gonna
be doing with her, right?

53:37.890 --> 53:39.974
Bring him across!

53:45.439 --> 53:47.941
Don't try anything stupid, Doyle.

53:48.317 --> 53:49.984
Nice and easy, huh?

53:50.152 --> 53:52.528
You don't wanna get the girl killed, right?

53:55.491 --> 53:57.367
Go. Get her back, now.

53:57.534 --> 54:00.286
You all right? Did they touch you?
They do anything?

54:00.454 --> 54:02.956
Strozzi!
I'm gonna settle things with you, Strozzi.

54:03.123 --> 54:04.749
I promise, you wop bastard.

54:04.917 --> 54:08.002
I promise. I promise!

54:57.678 --> 55:01.222
I had a visitor about 3
in the afternoon the next day.

55:01.724 --> 55:03.516
She'd had enough of Jericho...

55:03.684 --> 55:06.519
...but was too broke
to buy a bus ticket out.

55:09.106 --> 55:11.274
I slipped her 500 bucks.

55:11.442 --> 55:13.693
Usually, I wasn't such a sucker...

55:13.861 --> 55:16.821
...but somebody had smacked her around
pretty good.

55:19.283 --> 55:21.951
He's been in a real bad mood...

55:23.495 --> 55:26.914
...ever since his cousin
got traded back for that girl.

55:27.791 --> 55:32.128
He's been fighting with Giorgio,
acting like a real jerk...

55:33.338 --> 55:36.132
...yelling at anything that gets near him.

55:38.719 --> 55:41.345
I never seen him drunk before...

55:42.139 --> 55:45.183
...but he was really in the bag last night.

55:47.561 --> 55:49.312
What'd you do?

55:51.774 --> 55:53.900
I called him a name.

55:55.319 --> 55:59.322
So he slapped me,
slugged me a couple times.

56:01.492 --> 56:03.618
Threw my clothes out on the street.

56:04.036 --> 56:06.662
So I figured I'd get even.

56:08.165 --> 56:10.708
I told him about me and you.

56:14.880 --> 56:18.341
Well, I guess things could be worse.

56:21.470 --> 56:23.805
When you get back
to wherever it is you're going...

56:23.972 --> 56:27.308
...maybe you should try and find yourself
a better class of guy.

56:30.687 --> 56:33.564
No guy's gonna ever wanna mess
with me again.

56:35.859 --> 56:37.777
Your face will heal up.

56:37.945 --> 56:39.362
Your looks are all right.

56:53.252 --> 56:56.045
How is this gonna heal up?

57:00.801 --> 57:03.636
Like he said, I got a big mouth.

57:12.229 --> 57:15.064
He had three guys hold me down.

57:17.234 --> 57:19.735
Told Giorgio to slice it off.

57:34.793 --> 57:36.961
They were real drunk.

57:41.592 --> 57:45.428
But everything you ever did to me,
you did on purpose, right?

57:51.059 --> 57:52.101
Right?

58:02.863 --> 58:06.782
Did you finish all your business
inside with the little princess?

58:08.076 --> 58:10.620
Just make sure she gets on that bus.

58:11.955 --> 58:14.081
You know something, amigo?

58:14.625 --> 58:18.127
I think I just spotted a chink
in your armor.

58:18.420 --> 58:22.965
When you go down,
it's gonna be over a skirt.

58:32.517 --> 58:35.811
For most of my life,
I made my own rules.

58:36.146 --> 58:39.482
You don't do any favors.
You don't ask for any.

58:39.775 --> 58:42.151
Watch the percentages.

58:43.111 --> 58:46.697
But you can know the rules
and still do the wrong things.

58:47.324 --> 58:49.909
The only thing I knew for sure was this:

58:50.077 --> 58:53.996
Strozzi, Doyle, and every son of a bitch
that worked for them...

58:55.999 --> 58:58.668
They were all gonna be better off dead.

59:04.508 --> 59:08.302
There's somebody out here
to see you, Mr. Doyle.

59:14.017 --> 59:15.184
I thought it over.

59:15.352 --> 59:16.894
I'll take the job.

59:18.188 --> 59:19.855
You must smell a winner.

59:20.357 --> 59:22.233
I get a thousand in advance.

59:23.277 --> 59:24.860
Nobody's worth that much.

59:25.404 --> 59:26.737
He's good.

59:34.079 --> 59:35.204
Better than that?

59:35.372 --> 59:37.206
Put that goddamn gun away!

59:37.374 --> 59:38.416
Put it away!

59:38.583 --> 59:40.084
Save it for Strozzi!

59:40.252 --> 59:42.128
Suit yourself.

59:42.296 --> 59:43.754
Buy him.

59:49.594 --> 59:51.053
A thousand.

59:51.221 --> 59:53.723
And a thousand more when we win.

59:53.890 --> 59:56.058
It's settled. Let's have a drink on it.

59:56.226 --> 59:57.435
What about the girl?

59:57.602 --> 59:59.061
- What girl?
- The one you keep.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.732
Strozzi gets ahold of her again,
he'll blackmail you right out of town.

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:05.234
Don't worry about it.

01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:07.194
We got her in a safe place.

01:00:07.362 --> 01:00:09.238
And eight guys out there on watch.

01:00:09.865 --> 01:00:11.741
Eight's not gonna be enough.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:14.744
Strozzi's got some new trigger men
coming in town tonight.

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.996
Where'd you hear all this?

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:20.958
Maybe it's just a rumor.

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:24.086
You want me to check it out?

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.590
I want you and Hickey here with me.

01:00:29.009 --> 01:00:33.596
If Strozzi's got new help coming in,
chances are he's gonna try to rush us here.

01:00:34.056 --> 01:00:37.016
You go out to the country, check on her.

01:00:37.184 --> 01:00:39.393
She means a lot to me.

01:00:39.853 --> 01:00:42.521
McCool can tell you how to get there.

01:02:06.731 --> 01:02:08.065
The girl upstairs?

01:02:52.486 --> 01:02:53.527
You don't have to.

01:02:53.695 --> 01:02:56.572
- Don't come any closer. I'll kill her.
- Just put the gun down.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.908
Keep away from her
or I swear, I'll kill her.

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:00.242
No!

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.167
Get dressed. We gotta get out of here.

01:03:11.505 --> 01:03:13.422
Gotta get you to Mexico.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.090
Come on. Move.

01:03:22.682 --> 01:03:24.475
Here, take this money.

01:03:24.643 --> 01:03:27.144
Take it. I got it from Doyle.
I want you to use it.

01:03:27.312 --> 01:03:29.813
Get across the border
and don't come back.

01:03:29.981 --> 01:03:31.690
Come on. Get going.

01:03:37.489 --> 01:03:38.989
Go.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.050
Go.

01:04:07.561 --> 01:04:10.312
I always liked sinners
a lot better than saints.

01:04:14.734 --> 01:04:17.152
She was real easy to look at...

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.990
...but I hoped I never saw her again.

01:04:52.314 --> 01:04:54.273
They're all dead inside.

01:04:54.441 --> 01:04:55.858
I found them last night.

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.276
Where's the girl?

01:04:57.861 --> 01:04:59.403
I don't know.

01:04:59.571 --> 01:05:01.071
Strozzi must have taken her.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.342
All of them.

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.638
This is a slaughter.

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:29.183
You were right
about those extra trigger men.

01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:35.689
Must've taken 15 or 20 of Strozzi's guys
to pull this off.

01:05:36.775 --> 01:05:39.693
This whole thing is turning on us.

01:05:43.657 --> 01:05:47.117
When you found them out here,
why didn't you drive back and tell us...

01:05:47.285 --> 01:05:48.827
...instead of just waiting here?

01:05:49.371 --> 01:05:52.373
Figured the girl ran off
when the fighting started.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.417
I stuck around
hoping maybe she'd come back.

01:05:56.795 --> 01:05:58.003
She didn't.

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.598
This one hasn't been fired.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.769
Must have got killed
before he got a shot off.

01:06:19.359 --> 01:06:22.152
Strozzi's jealous of me
giving her a chance.

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:27.950
She grew up in some filthy little village.

01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:33.747
Told me her mother was a Yaqui Indian.

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:41.463
Didn't know much about her father,
except he was white.

01:06:42.674 --> 01:06:45.050
She married some lowlife wetback.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:51.807
The only thing he ever gave her
was a kid.

01:06:54.853 --> 01:06:58.814
Jesus Christ,
she only had one dress till she met me.

01:07:00.442 --> 01:07:02.317
The way she looked...

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.865
...the way her eyes looked...

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:12.786
...I couldn't help taking her
out of all that.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.002
We gotta hit Strozzi soon...

01:07:21.421 --> 01:07:23.172
...get her back.

01:07:24.382 --> 01:07:27.050
We have to get this thing over with.

01:07:28.094 --> 01:07:31.138
I'm gonna head back into town
and see what I can find out.

01:07:31.306 --> 01:07:34.266
Maybe Strozzi doesn't know
I work for you guys yet.

01:07:38.563 --> 01:07:41.190
We have to get this thing over with.

01:07:46.654 --> 01:07:48.530
Hickey was suspicious...

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.700
...Doyle was nuts
and McCool was stupid.

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:54.536
Except maybe I was the dumb one.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:59.166
If I had any brains, I would've
kept on driving straight south into Mexico.

01:08:16.643 --> 01:08:18.560
Keep her gassed up and ready to go.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:22.147
Yes, sir, I'll do her, but pretty soon
you're gonna be on your own.

01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:24.566
Come next week I'm getting the hell out.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.109
Ain't no business here.

01:08:26.277 --> 01:08:29.112
This town is finished.

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:41.542
As usual, it was hot as hell...

01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:45.002
...and the wind picked up the dust so much
you could taste it.

01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:46.630
The whisky helped...

01:08:46.798 --> 01:08:50.091
...but I didn't wanna get sloppy
so I switched to beer.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.937
Somehow I had the feeling
the walls were moving in on me.

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:06.358
It's funny how it all works out.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:10.737
For one little second, you think
you're gonna get away free and clear...

01:09:12.657 --> 01:09:15.283
...but you end up paying the price.

01:09:16.077 --> 01:09:18.078
No exceptions.

01:09:18.246 --> 01:09:22.374
Everybody pays the price,
even a bum like me.

01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:33.760
Take the guns.

01:09:37.055 --> 01:09:38.640
What is it?

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:45.981
Strozzi doesn't have Doyle's half-breed.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:48.984
McCool went across the border
looking for her...

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:50.819
...down in El Mirado.

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:53.322
And run into a guy
with an interesting story.

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:55.824
He'd seen her heading out.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:59.202
She sold our car to some guy
for a couple of hundred bucks.

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:01.330
Took a bus south.

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:04.166
So Strozzi didn't take her.

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:08.253
Maybe, if you believe the guy's story.

01:10:08.922 --> 01:10:10.631
Why would a guy lie?

01:10:10.798 --> 01:10:12.925
Which leaves the question
of how she got away.

01:10:13.092 --> 01:10:15.302
Big question.

01:10:16.763 --> 01:10:18.180
Not that we give a damn.

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:19.765
Indian girl, you know.

01:10:19.933 --> 01:10:23.602
It's not like she was the Blessed Virgin,
is it?

01:10:26.022 --> 01:10:28.231
Out there in the country...

01:10:28.816 --> 01:10:31.777
...only a real fine gunner
could have nailed that many...

01:10:31.945 --> 01:10:33.362
...all by himself.

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:37.366
But you work for us.
Why would you do that?

01:10:41.245 --> 01:10:42.663
Maybe you don't work for us.

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:46.458
Maybe you take the money,
do what you want.

01:10:46.626 --> 01:10:49.920
Are you one of them?
You an independent?

01:10:50.088 --> 01:10:51.713
Who you running from?

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:55.717
Jericho's a good place to stop
on your way to Mexico...

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:58.011
...running from the feds.

01:10:58.179 --> 01:11:00.889
For chrissakes,
everybody's running from something.

01:11:01.057 --> 01:11:04.101
No. See, working for people
like me and Doyle work for...

01:11:04.268 --> 01:11:05.894
...has an advantage.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:08.647
The payroll covers a lot of ground.

01:11:19.033 --> 01:11:20.659
You scared?

01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:25.330
Water's getting cold.

01:11:48.146 --> 01:11:49.938
Where is she?

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:34.483
He's nothing without a gun.

01:13:23.324 --> 01:13:28.120
After a while, you stop hearing
your bones break, your teeth rattle.

01:13:28.287 --> 01:13:32.457
You just concentrate on holding tight
to that little part right at the center.

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.835
The rest doesn't matter.

01:13:35.002 --> 01:13:37.587
They're gonna take the rest anyway.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.546
Must've crawled off.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:03.215
Block the streets.

01:15:03.382 --> 01:15:05.675
Wall him up! Wall him up!

01:15:05.843 --> 01:15:07.010
Find him for me.

01:15:07.178 --> 01:15:09.137
Search this whole hick town.

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:12.182
Look over there. Over there!
There, there! Over there!

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:14.309
Tear up every goddamn inch
of this place!

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:17.312
- Find him.
- Go on. You guys, come with me.

01:15:23.027 --> 01:15:24.694
Get those cars.

01:15:24.862 --> 01:15:27.155
Wall up these streets.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.574
Find him! Find him!

01:15:29.742 --> 01:15:30.825
Hey, come with me.

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:33.662
All right.
Come on around the back.

01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:52.180
Now. Clear.

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:54.557
Come on. Over here. Let's go.

01:15:54.725 --> 01:15:55.767
Come on.

01:16:02.316 --> 01:16:03.525
Find him.

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.402
Find him!

01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:09.614
Here! He's gotta be here.

01:16:11.325 --> 01:16:13.034
Nobody in, nobody out!

01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:16.037
Search this place.
Upstairs, behind the bar.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:17.580
Now! Find him!

01:16:17.748 --> 01:16:19.749
You, where is he? I know he's here.

01:16:19.917 --> 01:16:21.167
- Who?
- Smith!

01:16:21.335 --> 01:16:23.962
- Oh!
- Don't hold out on me, you shitheel!

01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:27.048
I will stick a knife in your throat!

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:32.220
Check the closets.

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:36.349
Nothing in here.
Not here.

01:16:37.435 --> 01:16:39.394
I'm telling you, don't you mess with me.

01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:40.937
This is not a game!

01:16:41.105 --> 01:16:42.605
Don't play around!

01:16:42.773 --> 01:16:45.650
You don't wanna talk to me?
You won't talk to anybody anymore.

01:16:45.818 --> 01:16:46.860
You think I'm kidding?

01:16:48.779 --> 01:16:49.863
Where is he?

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:56.244
Little fella doesn't wanna talk to us?

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:04.377
He came here, didn't he?

01:17:04.879 --> 01:17:08.423
Oh.
- Hold it. Goddamn it. Hold it.

01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:09.758
You hold it, John Law.

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.176
It's gone way past you.

01:17:11.344 --> 01:17:14.596
- This thing with Strozzi is over.
- You know where he is right now?

01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:18.016
He's holed up with the rest of his gang
waiting for new shooters...

01:17:18.184 --> 01:17:19.893
...that are coming to help him out.

01:17:20.061 --> 01:17:21.227
Where's Smith?

01:17:21.395 --> 01:17:23.521
He's at Slim's Roadhouse.

01:17:25.691 --> 01:17:27.525
We checked all over. He ain't upstairs.

01:17:27.693 --> 01:17:30.362
Come on. Load it up.
We're going to the roadhouse.

01:17:30.529 --> 01:17:32.906
You better be right.

01:18:05.523 --> 01:18:08.983
- What took you so long?
- I had to make it look good.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.337
You know, my helping you out
don't make a hell of a lot of sense.

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:31.005
But I'm betting on the ranger.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.218
I know that the big-money days
are just about done...

01:18:35.386 --> 01:18:37.011
...but don't kid yourselves, boys.

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.889
It could still come down real hard.

01:18:40.307 --> 01:18:42.016
Mr. Smith...

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:44.227
...I will help hide you.

01:18:44.395 --> 01:18:48.523
But I prefer you'd be unarmed
and on your way the hell out of this town.

01:18:49.233 --> 01:18:52.777
That move you made
for Doyle's little honey...

01:18:52.945 --> 01:18:53.987
...in this league...

01:18:55.489 --> 01:18:57.615
...that will get you broke and dead.

01:18:57.783 --> 01:19:00.326
Both at the same time.

01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:35.278
By the time we got
to Slim's Roadhouse...

01:19:35.446 --> 01:19:38.615
...Strozzi's men were trapped
inside the burning building.

01:19:38.782 --> 01:19:40.950
The ones that made a run for it got shot.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:44.412
The ones that stayed inside got cooked.

01:19:44.872 --> 01:19:47.582
None of them were gonna make it home
to Chicago.

01:19:54.006 --> 01:19:55.423
Don't shoot! Don't shoot me!

01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:58.092
I know where the money is.
Don't shoot me!

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:01.262
How about it, Strozzi! What's it gonna be?

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.515
I give up. You can have it.

01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:06.768
You can have everything. Take it all.

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:10.271
No!

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:14.609
No!

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.696
No!

01:20:24.912 --> 01:20:25.954
Kill him.

01:20:43.973 --> 01:20:45.682
Let's go.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:11.499
After the fire dies down, go inside.

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:14.502
Pull out Smith's body if you can find it.

01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:17.672
He's gotta be dead.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.632
He didn't come out.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.510
Everybody in there has gotta be dead.

01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:51.205
A little after dawn, Joe and Galt
got me to the abandoned church.

01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:57.211
The bill for helping the Indian girl
included kicked-in ribs...

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:59.047
...a broken nose...

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:01.549
...one eye mashed up pretty good.

01:22:01.717 --> 01:22:06.346
But all I needed was a gun
and some time to heal.

01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:35.750
Hey, Joe.

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.015
That's enough.

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.685
Get him inside.

01:23:05.114 --> 01:23:06.280
Give him a little more.

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.449
He needs another drink.
- No.

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:11.119
No!

01:23:12.079 --> 01:23:13.788
No!

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:17.291
We know he ain't dead yet.

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.086
We counted the bodies out there.

01:23:20.963 --> 01:23:24.298
Maybe you should take your shoes off
and look at your toes.

01:23:25.134 --> 01:23:28.636
Hickey gets back,
we'll be cutting them off one by one.

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:43.735
I knew by the sound of the car
it wasn't Joe.

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:52.660
It's a funny thing about people.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:56.998
One time out of a hundred,
they turned out better than you expect.

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:01.627
Just your old amigo.

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:06.758
Joe got caught making his daily run.

01:24:06.925 --> 01:24:10.636
The food, the bandages,
they just gave him away.

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.346
Hickey?

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:16.267
No, McCool and a couple other guys.

01:24:16.894 --> 01:24:19.854
Hickey and Doyle are in Mexico.

01:24:20.439 --> 01:24:24.317
Doyle's still looking
for that half-breed Indian girl.

01:24:25.402 --> 01:24:28.529
I mean, is that a persistent little bastard
or what?

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:31.532
Where did they take Joe?

01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:33.659
They're all over at Strozzi's hotel.

01:24:33.827 --> 01:24:36.370
Doyle moved them all over there
after winning the war.

01:24:45.798 --> 01:24:48.841
You really think
that you're gonna fight anybody with that?

01:24:49.927 --> 01:24:52.053
I can get a gun with it.

01:25:03.732 --> 01:25:06.567
That's the only help you gonna get.

01:25:31.885 --> 01:25:34.720
I always hated it when I owe somebody.

01:25:40.644 --> 01:25:44.105
But sometimes
you just gotta play out a bad hand.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.639
There were gonna be a lot more
wooden boxes in Smiley's window.

01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:21.434
But what the hell.

01:26:21.602 --> 01:26:23.936
Everybody ends up dead.

01:26:25.063 --> 01:26:26.814
It's just a matter of when.

01:28:34.234 --> 01:28:36.027
Well, thank you.

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:54.462
God!

01:28:55.213 --> 01:28:56.839
Damn!

01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:01.218
Go back to the Red Bird.

01:29:01.386 --> 01:29:03.387
Get my valise.

01:29:03.597 --> 01:29:05.473
Bring another bottle of whiskey.

01:29:05.932 --> 01:29:08.684
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.451
What's that?

01:29:27.162 --> 01:29:30.206
It's a message for Hickey.

01:29:30.749 --> 01:29:33.834
Him and Doyle get back,
you tell them I'm out at Slim's Roadhouse.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:35.377
Slim's Roadhouse?

01:29:35.545 --> 01:29:37.129
It's burned to the ground.

01:29:37.297 --> 01:29:39.882
It's gone, the whole place.

01:29:41.426 --> 01:29:42.676
Are you all right?

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:44.512
When is that ranger due back?

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.806
Day after tomorrow.

01:29:48.767 --> 01:29:51.185
That will give you enough time
to get it cleaned up.

01:29:51.353 --> 01:29:54.772
Cleaned up? I'm just gonna
haul those bodies out of the hotel...

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:58.651
...take them out in the desert and
let the coyotes chew on them for a while.

01:29:58.819 --> 01:30:00.486
Then I'm headed for Houston.

01:30:00.654 --> 01:30:03.280
Even Frank the undertaker is leaving town,
for chrissake.

01:30:03.448 --> 01:30:05.950
What kind of town we gonna have
without an undertaker?

01:30:06.118 --> 01:30:08.369
How about you, Joe?
You're staying put, ain't you?

01:30:08.537 --> 01:30:10.871
No, sir.
Right now, I'm going with him.

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:12.248
Like hell you are.

01:30:12.415 --> 01:30:14.708
I just wanna see this thing finished.

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:16.669
I earned it.

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:39.024
Joe and I sat up all night
waiting for Hickey and Doyle.

01:30:40.527 --> 01:30:44.530
When this thing got started,
all I wanted to do was make some money.

01:30:44.948 --> 01:30:48.242
Somewhere along the way,
it all got personal.

01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:56.584
You know...

01:30:56.877 --> 01:31:01.589
...for a guy with no principles,
sometimes you act kind of peculiar.

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:04.592
Don't go getting mushy on me, Joe.

01:31:05.552 --> 01:31:07.595
I was just trying to say thank you.

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:10.931
When I hear people thanking me,
I generally start running.

01:31:12.267 --> 01:31:13.684
How's your wound doing?

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:16.562
Hurts like hell.

01:31:17.063 --> 01:31:21.567
Closest doctor to here anymore
is just across the river in Mexico.

01:31:21.735 --> 01:31:23.736
I can show you the way.

01:31:30.202 --> 01:31:31.535
Go on back there and hide.

01:31:31.703 --> 01:31:33.454
Go find a spot. Go on.

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:35.206
Stay hidden.

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:12.868
You had me fooled.

01:32:13.036 --> 01:32:15.871
I really thought you burned up
with the rest of them.

01:32:16.039 --> 01:32:17.081
I knew better.

01:32:17.249 --> 01:32:20.000
It was always gonna come down
to something like this.

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:23.254
I want you thinking about me
when you're dying.

01:32:23.421 --> 01:32:26.006
Looks to me like you're the one bleeding.

01:32:26.258 --> 01:32:27.549
Now, hold it.

01:32:27.717 --> 01:32:29.051
We can get you a doctor.

01:32:29.219 --> 01:32:30.344
Get you patched up.

01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:33.180
You're gonna run this town with us.
I need you.

01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:36.183
Give me a fair fight,
you won't need a doctor.

01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:38.519
Now, wait. We don't need the guns.

01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:41.939
You, me and Hickey, we won this war.
We're survivors.

01:32:42.107 --> 01:32:43.607
We won! We won!

01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:54.201
I haven't found the girl yet.

01:32:54.369 --> 01:32:56.287
You know, the girl.

01:33:00.834 --> 01:33:03.127
You must know where she is.

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.754
You think we can still find her?

01:33:05.922 --> 01:33:07.881
We can go to Mexico.

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:09.842
She's up there in the mountains.

01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:11.677
Some little village.

01:33:11.845 --> 01:33:13.846
She had a kid.

01:33:14.556 --> 01:33:16.432
A little girl.

01:33:18.018 --> 01:33:19.768
I gotta get her back.

01:33:31.031 --> 01:33:32.406
I'm telling you we can be partners.

01:33:38.038 --> 01:33:40.998
That's for what he done to my town. Ha-ha.

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:43.584
You're gonna have to kill me too.

01:33:43.752 --> 01:33:45.419
No. Don't worry.

01:33:45.587 --> 01:33:47.338
I'm all done.

01:33:47.505 --> 01:33:49.673
I'm just gonna watch.

01:34:10.862 --> 01:34:13.614
I don't wanna die in Texas.

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:15.949
Chicago maybe.

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:20.621
You can meet me there if you want,
and try and kill me.

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:34.593
Maybe you're the kind of guy...

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:37.179
...that would shoot an unarmed man
in the back.

01:34:37.347 --> 01:34:39.390
Done worse than that.

01:34:58.076 --> 01:35:01.620
I can't say it all went exactly
the way I planned.

01:35:02.497 --> 01:35:04.998
But I was right about one thing.

01:35:06.376 --> 01:35:09.002
They were all better off dead.

01:35:17.804 --> 01:35:21.890
Goddamn, I wasn't real sure
this old gun would still shoot.

01:35:24.394 --> 01:35:27.354
Looks like you got yourself a new car.

01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:50.627
And that was it.

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:54.047
It ended about the same place
where it started.

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:57.217
Out in the desert on the road to Mexico.

01:35:57.552 --> 01:36:00.596
And I was just as broke as when I arrived.

01:36:01.014 --> 01:36:03.223
But something would turn up.

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:05.225
It always does.
