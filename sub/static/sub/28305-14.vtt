00:01.871 --> 00:03.568
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, you recall
Jane and Rafael

00:03.612 --> 00:05.744
got back together. That's
right, love was in the air.

00:05.788 --> 00:09.400
Which reminds me... We only have 72 more hours
of breathable oxygen

00:09.444 --> 00:14.231
before all known
life-forms on Mars go extinct.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.407
Yes, Rogelio shot his pilot
forThis Is Mars.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.756
Now he just had to wait

00:17.800 --> 00:20.194
to see if it will be
picked up to series.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.761
Oh, and Xiomara was at
a career crossroads as well.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.025
I'm thinking about
going to nursing school.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.678
And speaking of smart moves...

00:26.722 --> 00:28.637
Petra finally, finally got

00:28.680 --> 00:30.552
full control over the Marbella.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.075
Which brings us to Rafael.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.034
See, he used to own
the Marbella.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.644
Only now,
he works in real estate.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.254
That's right, friends.
Rafael's life

00:37.298 --> 00:39.169
had gone in
a different direction.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.389
But there was one huge
bright spot.

00:41.432 --> 00:44.261
Will you marry me?Yes.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.220
I know! I'm excited, too.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.222
Plus, they'd started talking
about the future.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.398
Would you ever consider
having more kids?

00:50.441 --> 00:52.095
I'd be open
to talking about that.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.357
How sweet, right?

00:53.401 --> 00:55.446
So let's start
planning that wedding.

00:58.362 --> 01:01.757
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was 25 years old,

01:01.800 --> 01:03.672
she got married
for the first time.

01:03.715 --> 01:07.415
And, friends,
it was a very happy day.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.503
Well, not for him.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.592
I know this is
terrible timing,

01:10.635 --> 01:12.246
but I love you, Jane.

01:12.289 --> 01:13.986
Don't marry
Michael, please.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.380
But, friends,
he didn't say any of that.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.339
Instead, he said...

01:18.382 --> 01:20.906
Good luck.
You look beautiful.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.344
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
They say, if you love someone,

01:23.387 --> 01:27.217
let them go,
which Rafael did that day.

01:27.261 --> 01:30.525
And he wasn't going
to make that mistake again.

01:30.568 --> 01:31.917
Can't breathe.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.355
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.183
Let the wedding planning begin.

01:36.226 --> 01:37.923
Barry, I don't care

01:37.967 --> 01:39.490
who you have to
kill or sleep with

01:39.534 --> 01:41.188
or kill then sleep with.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.711
I need this pickup.
Do something.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.321
You always tell me

01:44.365 --> 01:46.758
what a powerful agent
you are, and right now

01:46.802 --> 01:48.412
all I'm hearing
are a lot of excuses.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.371
Is that your superpower?
Excuses?!

01:50.414 --> 01:51.546
What's going on?

01:51.589 --> 01:53.504
The studio has
the first cut of his pilot,

01:53.548 --> 01:55.158
but there's been
radio silence,

01:55.202 --> 01:56.464
so he's freaking out.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.424
I don't think he's breathed
in two days.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.730
Poor Dad.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.340
You wear glasses now?

02:03.384 --> 02:05.473
I'm still waiting to hear about
my nursing school application,

02:05.516 --> 02:07.953
so I've been distracting myself
with some medical reading.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.607
Turns out I needed
reading glasses.

02:09.651 --> 02:12.044
Plus, you know,
they make me feel smarter.

02:12.088 --> 02:14.046
Oh...
Okay, wedding planning.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.048
Should we get to it?ROGELIO:
Yes.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.876
That's the attitude
I need from you, Barry.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.226
Earn that ten percent.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.792
Okay, why don't
the four of us

02:20.836 --> 02:22.403
start talking and Dad can...Wait, Ma.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.405
Can I see that mole?

02:24.448 --> 02:27.059
Is it raised?
You have to think F.A.T.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.236
Flat, asymmetrical,
tri-color.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.194
Those are the scary moles that
need to be checked right away.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.413
Wow.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.287
What can I say?

02:37.331 --> 02:39.811
Runs in the family.JANE: Aw, aw.

02:39.855 --> 02:42.423
Does anyone maybe want to talk
about anyone's upcoming wedding?

02:42.466 --> 02:45.208
Yes, of course.
Sorry, yes. Just...

02:45.252 --> 02:46.470
The sequel is never as good
as the original.

02:46.514 --> 02:47.819
What?

02:47.863 --> 02:49.473
Barry's trying
to get me excited about

02:49.517 --> 02:51.954
a follow-up to Tiago
to take my mind off the pilot.

02:51.997 --> 02:54.130
You know what might
take your mind off the pilot?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.958
Your daughter's wedding!

02:56.001 --> 02:58.265
Yes. Good.
Let's talk wedding.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.747
I'm sorry, I have
to take this call.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.227
Do you mind if we
postpone this meeting?

03:04.271 --> 03:05.837
I really want to give it
my full attention.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.491
Yeah, of course.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.927
Talk to me, Barry.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.146
Okay, I'm gonna go
read up on that mole.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.104
You might have to
have it checked, Ma.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.602
RAFAEL:
Well, I want to plan
the wedding with you.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.517
You do?
Mm-hmm.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.650
I do. Go ahead,
what's first on your list?

03:35.693 --> 03:37.304
Finding an officiant.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.001
You don't want
to use your priest?

03:39.044 --> 03:40.785
Come on.
I know the Catholic

03:40.829 --> 03:42.396
wedding ceremony
isn't your thing.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.049
So I did a little
research, and I found

03:44.093 --> 03:46.356
a Unitarian minister
who respects all beliefs

03:46.400 --> 03:47.879
and comes highly recommended.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.664
Mm, that sounds
really nice.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.622
Good, because I already
wrote him a very long

03:51.666 --> 03:53.233
and persuasive e-mail.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.973
We have an appointment
the day after tomorrow.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.888
I'll be there. What is next?

03:56.932 --> 03:58.238
Um, where do you
want to get married?

03:58.281 --> 04:00.370
Inside or
outside? Or...

04:00.414 --> 04:02.242
something that looks like
it's outside but is actually

04:02.285 --> 04:03.939
inside a soundstage,
because if we ask,

04:03.982 --> 04:05.288
my dad will build it for us.

04:05.332 --> 04:08.465
Outside.
Actual outside.

04:08.509 --> 04:09.901
That's what I want, too.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.208
Um... which...

04:12.252 --> 04:13.688
guides my dress choice.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.646
And luckily,
my fashion expert lands

04:15.690 --> 04:17.213
in a few hours.
Oh, yeah.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.910
First bridal shop
appointment with Lina

04:18.954 --> 04:20.347
is Tuesday, right?

04:20.390 --> 04:23.567
It is so sexy when you
closely read our calendar.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.308
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.789
I think I read something
about a hair test... tomorrow?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.357
Ooh, baby, don't stop.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.709
Oh, I can't wait to marry you.

04:34.752 --> 04:37.015
I can't wait to marry you, too.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.020
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG. I missed Lina.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.718
Hello, bride!

04:43.761 --> 04:45.328
Oh! Hello,
matron of honor.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.938
How was your flight?

04:46.982 --> 04:48.505
Perfect. I totally mastered

04:48.549 --> 04:50.333
the Benzos-Chardonnay
cocktail, mmm.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.379
And I made it here before
that huge storm that's

04:52.422 --> 04:54.337
supposed to hit. Thank God.
Danny was so worried.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.513
Oh, how is Danny?
And the new apartment?

04:56.557 --> 04:58.341
And F.I.T.?

04:58.385 --> 05:01.257
F.I.T.? Is that another
scary mole acronym?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.694
Great. I still
can't believe that

05:03.738 --> 05:06.828
I'm in school
for fashion. Ah. Of course.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.265
And I love everything about it.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.833
I even like doing
homework now. What?

05:11.876 --> 05:14.226
I never thought I'd hear
you say that sentence.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.706
I know.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.100
And I'm gonna find you
the perfect dress

05:18.143 --> 05:20.276
with my new highly educated
designer brain.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.061
Which is not going to be
anything like this teal tragedy.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.802
God, it feels
so good to be here

05:24.846 --> 05:26.674
as a guest
and not an employee.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.153
Oh, don't rub it in.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.416
Speaking of...

05:29.459 --> 05:31.331
How is the writing going?

05:31.374 --> 05:34.072
I'm getting closer
to the end of my novel.

05:34.116 --> 05:37.598
And I really think
I found my voice.PETRA: This is mine.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.687
This is mine. This is mine.

05:39.730 --> 05:43.343
Mine, mine, mine, mine.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.519
Petra certainly found
her voice.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.913
Oh, it's all
officially 100% mine, Krishna.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.480
Congratulations, Ms. Solano.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.613
I have so many plans to take
the Marbella to the next level,

05:52.656 --> 05:54.658
and I want to hear
your ideas, too.Oh, well, okay.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.356
I was thinking
we could expand...Shut it. Oh, my God.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.401
That's Chef Ludo.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Who-do?

05:58.445 --> 06:00.185
Ludo Lefebvre, the famous chef.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.187
How does Rafael know him?
Does he know him?

06:02.231 --> 06:04.712
I don't know that he...Shh! I'm trying to listen.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.017
LUDO:
Wait.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.584
You have
three kids now?
Yeah.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.151
Yeah, I just dropped off

06:09.194 --> 06:10.761
two-thirds of them
at the kids' club.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.067
What about you?

06:12.110 --> 06:13.764
On vacation now.
With the family.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.418
Oh, well, times have changed.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.985
It's good to see you, buddy.You, too.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.943
All right.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.424
Oh!
How do you
know Chef Ludo?

06:21.468 --> 06:22.860
Wh-wh...
Where did you come from?

06:22.904 --> 06:25.210
I own the place.
It's my job to lurk. Explain.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.734
I used to run into him
all the time

06:26.777 --> 06:28.388
back when I was
in the hotel circuit.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.259
I just can't believe
such a renowned chef

06:30.302 --> 06:32.392
is here in the hotel.
It just feels like kismet.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.655
Why's that?I'd love to pitch him

06:34.698 --> 06:36.004
a collaboration
with the Marbella

06:36.047 --> 06:37.658
now that it's mine,
mine, all mine. Yay.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.442
Do you think you
could introduce us?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.618
Oh, uh...

06:41.662 --> 06:43.838
uh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.058
RAFAEL:
It just felt weird
for her to ask me

06:47.102 --> 06:48.886
for my help like that
with no acknowledgement.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.801
I mean, this hotel
used to be mine.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.064
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
His, his, all his.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.805
I get it, but do you want to go

06:54.849 --> 06:56.894
back to the
hotel life?

06:56.938 --> 06:59.854
Back to whiskey and investors
and... tight shirts?

06:59.897 --> 07:01.333
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I can't imagine that shirt

07:01.377 --> 07:02.900
getting any tighter. I mean, of course.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.641
Really?

07:04.685 --> 07:06.338
The Marbella was my hotel.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.731
I put so much into it.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.690
It-it meant everything to me.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.126
Then I think you should talk

07:11.169 --> 07:12.736
to Petra about
how you feel.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.522
Yeah. Okay. I will.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.089
Love you. Love you, too.
Okay, bye.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.787
Okay. The groom is good.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.223
Sorry. Let's talk dresses.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.312
Perfect.
What were you thinking?

07:23.355 --> 07:25.532
Well, this is my second wedding,

07:25.575 --> 07:28.448
so I wanted to go a little more
nontraditional this time.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.407
But not too nontraditional.
I don't want to scare my abuela.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.931
Mm-hmm.I was thinking I could wear

07:33.975 --> 07:38.719
a mermaid-inspired dress
since that's what I was wearing

07:38.762 --> 07:41.591
the first time Raf and I
saw each other at the Marbella.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.987
Wow. You really like that idea?:
No.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.772
Honestly, I think
it's really cheesy.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.428
So, uh, what's going on?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.300
Danny and I are having trouble
conceiving,

07:55.344 --> 07:59.827
so I wanted to ask you if
I could have one of your eggs.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.872
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. That didn't go over easy.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.226
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Where were we?

08:08.270 --> 08:12.970
I didn't even know you two
were trying to have a baby.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.189
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes.

08:14.232 --> 08:15.669
Lina was looking
to poach Jane's eggs.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.671
We have been for a while.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.369
And I totally thought Danny
was shooting blanks, and...

08:20.412 --> 08:23.372
but he was tested, and his
junk's spunky as hell.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.853
Apparently,
I'm the problem.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.463
Something's not working.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.638
Anyway, turns out
I could've been

08:28.682 --> 08:30.031
way sluttier
in high school.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.293
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well...

08:31.336 --> 08:32.947
I am so sorry, Lina.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.470
Are you okay?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.037
Yeah, totally.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.735
I just don't want
some rando anonymous donor.

08:38.779 --> 08:42.434
And I-I'd ask one of my sisters,
but you know them.

08:42.478 --> 08:45.916
They're kind of bitchy
party animals, and...

08:45.960 --> 08:50.138
you're so good and smart
and not bitchy.

08:50.181 --> 08:53.707
And... I want my kid
to be like you.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.666
So, will you consider it?

08:56.710 --> 08:59.843
Of course I'll consider it.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.803
I-I'm... I'm flattered
you'd even ask.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.154
It's just, um,

09:06.197 --> 09:08.156
a big decision, so...

09:08.199 --> 09:10.375
I should talk to Raf about it.Yeah.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.855
You okay?

09:11.899 --> 09:14.031
You've been quiet
since you got here.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.599
I'm fine. I just have
to talk to you about something.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.732
A big something or
a little something?

09:18.775 --> 09:20.864
I'll tell you later.XIOMARA:
Tell what?

09:20.908 --> 09:22.823
ROGELIO:
Yes, tell
everyone, Jane.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.607
Dad, is that Instagram live?

09:24.651 --> 09:26.609
I have an incredibly
active online following,

09:26.653 --> 09:28.611
so I decided to give them an
all-access pass into my life,

09:28.655 --> 09:31.005
including a seat at our
family dinner table.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.833
In return, they will
flood the Internet

09:32.876 --> 09:36.488
with #ThisIsMars
to build up some buzz.

09:36.532 --> 09:40.971
Right, uh,
TowelTuesday349 from Phoenix

09:41.015 --> 09:43.626
who just sent me
an eggplant emoji.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.628
How long are you doing this?Until we get picked up.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.675
It's like a hunger strike,
but less sad.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.199
Well, do it
somewhere else.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.679
Jane's gonna tell us
something important.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.028
I wasn't, actually.Go, Rogelio!

09:54.071 --> 09:56.247
I'll fill you all in
later. Don't worry.

09:56.291 --> 10:00.034
Oh, yes, MattyMatt2828,
my wife does wear the pants,

10:00.077 --> 10:01.992
but remember-- I wear the tail!

10:02.036 --> 10:04.647
#ThisIsMars!

10:04.691 --> 10:07.432
So, what were you
gonna tell us?Well,

10:07.476 --> 10:11.001
Lina is struggling
to have a baby, and she asked

10:11.045 --> 10:13.177
if I can give her
one of my eggs.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.963
Oh. Wow.

10:16.006 --> 10:19.009
That's touching
that she asked you.

10:19.053 --> 10:21.229
I don't think
you should do it.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.927
Thank God
you said it.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.537
Wait, why?

10:25.581 --> 10:26.800
Because we know you, Jane.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.105
Think about
when you were pregnant

10:28.149 --> 10:29.629
and planning
to give up the baby.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.892
It was really hard
for you to let go.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.807
But this is different.
I'm not gonna be pregnant.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.418
I'm just gonna be donating one
of my eggs to my best friend.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.898
RAFAEL:
No.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.029
You're donating your
biological child

10:39.073 --> 10:41.423
to your best
friend to raise.

10:41.466 --> 10:42.946
I mean, the baby
will technically

10:42.990 --> 10:44.731
be Mateo's brother
or sister, right?

10:44.774 --> 10:47.124
And are you uncomfortable
with that?

10:47.168 --> 10:49.300
I'll support you no matter what.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.085
It's your body,

10:51.128 --> 10:52.477
it's your choice.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.001
But I'm just
worried that...

10:54.044 --> 10:57.221
it'll be harder than you think
for you to let go.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.093
"Let go of...?"
Dad, stop.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.834
I'm sorry,
my followers

11:00.877 --> 11:02.400
crave content,
and they were not enjoying

11:02.444 --> 11:04.359
the tour of Alba's bedroom.Oh...

11:04.402 --> 11:05.665
Xiomara...

11:10.017 --> 11:13.934
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to... There you are.

11:13.977 --> 11:17.764
So, I was thinking,

11:17.807 --> 11:20.157
you know what the perfect
stress reliever might be?

11:20.201 --> 11:21.985
Yes.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.987
A series pickup.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.207
No, besides that.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.209
No, I do not.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.864
But everyone should message
me what they think it is.

11:30.907 --> 11:35.390
And don't forget to add
#RoOnMars, #ThisIsMars,

11:35.433 --> 11:38.001
#ThisWontBeMars
WithoutASeriesPickup.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.351
of an audience.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.092
Turn that thing off.No, I can't.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.616
I promised them nonstop coverage
until we get a pickup.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.228
And I cannot disappoint
my #Rogelifans.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.491
Well, I can.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.971
No. No.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.887
Enjoy nature. Track the storm.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.415
And you...

12:00.458 --> 12:02.504
enjoy this view.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.903
That was great.Mm.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.470
Think you'll be able to sleep?

12:12.514 --> 12:14.211
Maybe.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.604
It's hard to relax
when your dream's

12:15.647 --> 12:18.128
just out there, you know?

12:18.172 --> 12:19.390
Up to someone else.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.915
Yeah, I get it.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.482
I'm worried, too, about getting
into nursing school.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.049
I know.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.269
That's another thing
that's stressing me out.

12:28.312 --> 12:31.272
I talked about it a few hours
ago on my livestream.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.797
But talking
doesn't change anything.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
The truth is,
it's out of our hands.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.540
You have to let it go.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.456
I know. I'm trying.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.638
Huh.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.422
I think your heart's off-rhythm.

12:51.466 --> 12:55.209
Well, that's ridiculous.
I have impeccable rhythm.

12:55.252 --> 12:58.255
And we just had a round
of incredible lovemaking.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.083
I don't know.
Maybe we should go to a doctor.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.824
Xiomara, you sent Alba
to the doctor

13:01.868 --> 13:04.087
for her mole fat,
and it was nothing.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.524
You're letting all of that
medical reading get to you.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.228
LINA:
I'm a little worried,

13:14.271 --> 13:17.274
because you look like that
dragon girl from that nerd show.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.538
Yeah, it's a bit much.

13:20.582 --> 13:23.237
Maybe we can try another style?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.108
Less Khaleesi?

13:25.152 --> 13:27.110
Do you have a book
or something?

13:27.154 --> 13:29.156
Please and thank you.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.292
So, what did Raf say?

13:35.336 --> 13:38.295
He's supportive, but
he was also worried

13:38.339 --> 13:40.080
that I wouldn't be able
to let go--

13:40.123 --> 13:42.082
which I obviously
would have to.Uh-huh.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.954
So I guess I just
have some questions.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.261
Of course. Yeah.
Ask me anything.Um...

13:47.304 --> 13:49.219
What would I be to this child?

13:49.263 --> 13:52.048
Um, the favorite aunt?

13:52.092 --> 13:54.311
I mean, you'd have very little
competition from my sisters.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.097
And what about Mateo?

13:57.140 --> 13:59.882
Uh, would they be,
like, cousins?

13:59.926 --> 14:02.929
Cousins sounds great.
Yes. Great.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.670
And, um,

14:05.714 --> 14:09.239
would we tell the baby
how he or she was conceived?

14:10.240 --> 14:13.200
Oh, um, I don't know.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.157
We'd have to.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.812
Okay.
When?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.770
Uh, w-we'd figure that out.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.556
I think as soon as he
or she could understand.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.036
Right.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.212
But that would be
my decision.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.344
Because I'd be the mom.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.303
And this would be,
like, the kind of thing

14:29.346 --> 14:32.306
that you'd let go of, right?

14:36.527 --> 14:38.268
RAFAEL:
Can you talk for a minute?

14:38.312 --> 14:41.619
I don't want this
to affect our relationship,

14:41.663 --> 14:43.578
but I have been thinking
a lot about the hotel, and...

14:43.621 --> 14:45.232
Yesterday was weird, right?

14:45.275 --> 14:46.276
The whole Ludo thing?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.235
I've been thinking
about it, too.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.063
Really?

14:50.106 --> 14:51.368
Yeah. I mean,

14:51.412 --> 14:53.675
this was your hotel,
and so for me to ask you

14:53.718 --> 14:55.155
for advice
just feels somehow wrong.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.244
So,

14:57.287 --> 14:58.506
I had an idea.

14:58.549 --> 15:01.117
A way for both of us to benefit.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.165
I want to offer you a job.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.949
And a percentage of everything
we'd build together

15:06.993 --> 15:08.385
going forward.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.562
When did you do all this?

15:11.606 --> 15:13.608
Had everything brought up
from storage last night.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.312
I think we could do
great things together,

15:22.356 --> 15:24.749
starting with
the Chef Ludo collaboration.

15:24.793 --> 15:28.318
You know, I bet he'd really
respond to the idea

15:28.362 --> 15:30.277
of a branded restaurant
in the Marbella.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.366
Or a pop-up.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.976
Given how trendy
pop-ups are,

15:34.020 --> 15:35.978
what if we translated that
to the hotel space?

15:36.022 --> 15:38.024
Well, he's done pop-ups.Still, it's certainly
more exciting

15:38.067 --> 15:39.242
than a branded restaurant.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.635
We'd do a rotation,

15:40.678 --> 15:42.985
a new hot chef every month
with Ludo supervising.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.031
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, I want that calendar.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.337
Could be great.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.861
So, does that mean you're in?

15:49.905 --> 15:52.560
So I said yes. I'll keep
my real estate job for now,

15:52.603 --> 15:54.562
but I'm excited
to get back to it.

15:54.605 --> 15:55.780
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.130
Thanks.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.001
I'm happy, too.
But I got to dive in.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.002
Ludo's only here

16:00.046 --> 16:01.003
two more days,

16:01.047 --> 16:02.352
so can we reschedule

16:02.396 --> 16:03.745
our appointment
with the minister?

16:03.788 --> 16:05.486
Oh, no. Really?

16:05.529 --> 16:06.878
I'm sorry.

16:06.922 --> 16:07.923
No, it's fine.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.272
I'll beg him to switch.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.144
As long as you promise
to fill out

16:11.187 --> 16:13.450
the list of questions he sent
to get to know us better.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.756
Wow, a list.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.410
No wonder you wanted this guy.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.933
On it.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.152
How'd it go with Lina?

16:19.195 --> 16:22.459
Uh, it was, uh, complicated.

16:22.503 --> 16:25.027
I might just say no
and blame it on you.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.247
Don't you dare.
I am scared of Lina.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.684
Ooh. I see Mateo.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.252
Good luck with your meeting.WOMAN: Jane.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.255
Hey, congratulations.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.778
Uh...

16:40.173 --> 16:42.653
Congratulations, Jane.
We're all so happy for you.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.091
Happy for me because...?

16:45.134 --> 16:48.442
Mateo told everyone that
you're expecting a baby.

16:48.485 --> 16:49.878
Mazel tov.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.358
Oh...

16:52.315 --> 16:54.317
Uh...

17:03.457 --> 17:05.415
Ugh. Sorry I'm late.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.201
You won't believe what happened.

17:08.244 --> 17:11.073
What?Uh, Dad, I really don't want
to be on camera right now.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.467
Anything you can say to me,
you can say to my fans.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.991
They want to be part of
your wedding planning so badly.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.254
Just give me a minute
to make a call.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.429
You got it. No problem.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.129
Stop. Stay there.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.913
All seven million of you.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.046
9.4 million and rising.

17:30.310 --> 17:33.052
Raf? Where are you?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.183
RAFAEL:
Change of plans.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.098
I'm at a bar
with Ludo and Petra.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.492
I won't be home until late.
I'm so sorry.

17:38.535 --> 17:41.103
It's just been crazy.
He wants to set up a meeting!

17:41.147 --> 17:43.627
And he wants to drink-- a lot.

17:43.671 --> 17:47.849
Oh, okay, well, uh, I was gonna
tell you when you got home,

17:47.892 --> 17:50.112
but Mateo thinks
we're having a baby.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.419
Oh, I love you, too, baby.

17:52.462 --> 17:55.726
Uh, uh, never mind.
See you tonight.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.777
So, yes, while This Is Mars
is the most important project

18:02.820 --> 18:04.431
of my career,
my daughter's happiness

18:04.474 --> 18:07.347
is the most important
project of my life.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.044
Speaking of,
where's our groom?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.741
Oh, he's gonna miss
this wedding meeting

18:10.785 --> 18:12.787
because he's at happy
hour with a new client.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.310
Wow. Day drinking?

18:14.354 --> 18:16.225
Is he turning back
into the old Rafael?

18:16.269 --> 18:18.053
No, definitely not.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.142
To catch you up,
her fiancé Rafael

18:20.186 --> 18:22.536
has quite a history.
Look him up.

18:22.579 --> 18:25.016
Okay, let's talk color schemes.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.757
MATEO:
Why isn't Daddy home yet?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.933
He's working late tonight.
You'll see him in the morning.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.848
So, hey,

18:30.892 --> 18:32.894
I wanted to ask
you something.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.853
How come you told your class
I'm having a baby?

18:35.897 --> 18:37.551
I heard you and Daddy talking

18:37.594 --> 18:39.901
about a brother
or sister for me.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.034
The baby will
technically be Mateo's

18:43.078 --> 18:44.775
brother or sister, right?

18:44.819 --> 18:47.561
Oh, honey,
I'm not having a baby.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.780
What Daddy meant
was I may be helping

18:49.824 --> 18:51.260
Lina have one.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.784
What do you mean?

18:53.828 --> 18:55.873
Hmm. Remember how we talked

18:55.917 --> 18:58.180
about how you came
from a little egg?

18:58.224 --> 19:01.227
Well, Lina's little
eggs aren't working,

19:01.270 --> 19:04.186
so she asked
if she can borrow one of mine

19:04.230 --> 19:05.927
so that she can
have a baby

19:05.970 --> 19:07.581
to love and take care of.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.540
Will we ever get to see it?Sometimes.

19:10.584 --> 19:13.935
But not a lot, because it'll be
Lina and Danny's child,

19:13.978 --> 19:15.284
and they live
in New York.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.243
But it would be your baby.

19:17.286 --> 19:21.247
Biologically, but not actually.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.163
I'm confused.You know what?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.295
Me, too.

19:26.339 --> 19:29.298
Which is why I haven't decided
if I'm going to do it.

19:29.342 --> 19:32.345
Because it's
a really big decision.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.042
Don't worry, Mommy.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.305
You'll decide right.
You always do.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.351
Oh.

19:43.617 --> 19:44.966
Pink means pregnant.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.576
But I've never had sex.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.361
It's not a stupid milkshake.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.927
It's a baby,

19:49.971 --> 19:51.973
and I'm gonna
get attached to it.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.237
Can't breathe.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.239
Oh, sorry.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.548
LINA:
What are you thinking?

20:01.591 --> 20:03.332
JANE:
Uh, not for me.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.769
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or me. Barf.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.423
Are you sure?

20:07.467 --> 20:11.297
You don't want to walk around,
get a feel for it?

20:11.340 --> 20:13.342
Wait, why? You like it?

20:13.386 --> 20:14.778
Oh, no, girl. I hate it.

20:14.822 --> 20:15.997
But my fingers
are cramped from doing

20:16.040 --> 20:17.564
all those buttons,
so I need a little break

20:17.607 --> 20:18.565
before I undo them.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.001
Fair enough.

20:20.044 --> 20:23.265
So, have you thought more
about how you'd feel

20:23.309 --> 20:25.224
on the whole letting go front?

20:25.267 --> 20:27.051
Yeah.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.053
And I want to be able to,

20:29.097 --> 20:32.187
but I have some
more questions.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.668
Okay. Ask them.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.627
What will you do with
any extra embryos?

20:37.671 --> 20:39.281
I'm not sure.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
I-I guess we have to see
how it goes.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.373
Well, uh, how many are
you planning to implant?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.636
I don't know yet.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.638
So you might do multiples?

20:48.682 --> 20:50.858
I haven't thought
about all those specifics yet.

20:50.901 --> 20:53.077
You're gonna have to think
about these things.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.383
I will.

20:54.427 --> 20:57.038
Okay, uh, so who
would the baby go to

20:57.081 --> 21:00.128
if you and Danny... died?

21:00.171 --> 21:01.347
What?Like I said, these are...

21:01.390 --> 21:02.870
Okay, you know what?
This is a mistake.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.306
You clearly can't let go.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.047
Of course I can't just
let go, because it's not

21:06.090 --> 21:07.788
a milkshake, Lina;
it's a baby.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.920
A milkshake?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.400
I just mean that
it's a big deal.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.186
You think I don't know that?

21:15.230 --> 21:17.101
I have been trying
to get pregnant

21:17.145 --> 21:19.190
for over a year,

21:19.234 --> 21:21.497
with all the shots
and the hormones

21:21.541 --> 21:23.325
and the millions
of doctors' appointments,

21:23.369 --> 21:25.196
so I really don't
need you telling me

21:25.240 --> 21:27.068
that I'm a bad mother
before I even start.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.293
Lina!

21:34.336 --> 21:36.773
Lina, I am so sorry.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.122
I didn't mean to
make you feel worse.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.560
It just hurts
that you clearly think

21:40.603 --> 21:42.997
I'm not taking
this whole thing seriously.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.694
It makes me feel
like a bad mom,

21:44.738 --> 21:47.784
which I already feel like
because I can't get pregnant.

21:47.828 --> 21:50.526
Like even God doesn't
think I'm cut out for it.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.616
Okay, you are not
going to be a bad mom.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.227
I don't think that, and God
definitely doesn't think that.

21:56.271 --> 21:58.360
If that was his criteria
for handing out babies,

21:58.404 --> 21:59.927
all your sisters
would be barren.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.145
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Agreed.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.930
What about all
your questions before?

22:02.973 --> 22:05.628
You wouldn't have asked
anyone else all that stuff.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.717
That's true,

22:07.761 --> 22:10.416
because I wouldn't consider
doing it for anyone else.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.156
Only you.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.031
ROGELIO:
What can I say? I am touched

22:17.074 --> 22:19.686
that you Rogeli-superfans

22:19.729 --> 22:22.123
have been with me for two days,

22:22.166 --> 22:25.431
three hours and six minutes.

22:25.474 --> 22:28.608
Unfortunately, still nothing
from the studio on my pilot,

22:28.651 --> 22:29.870
but that's okay.

22:29.913 --> 22:33.047
We soldier on, and we exfoliate,

22:33.090 --> 22:34.875
and we moisturize.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.268
And I want you to know
from the bottom of my heart...

22:40.359 --> 22:41.838
My heart.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.971
Rogeli-fans, send help!

22:48.976 --> 22:51.065
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, we last left Rogelio
clutching his chest.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.458
Thank God you didn't
have a heart attack.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.068
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Agreed. Thank God.

22:54.111 --> 22:57.245
Thank God, Dad.XIOMARA:
What are you wearing?

22:57.288 --> 23:00.161
I ran out
when I heard.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.031
I'm okay.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.251
It was just a...

23:03.294 --> 23:04.948
f...

23:04.992 --> 23:07.516
Lone atrial
fibrillation,

23:07.560 --> 23:09.562
an electrical problem
with the heart,

23:09.605 --> 23:11.215
likely brought on
by stress.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.479
Oh.But he had a procedure,
and he's gonna be fine.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.219
Yeah, they shocked me
with some paddles,

23:15.263 --> 23:17.918
and turns out I was holding
them wrong when I played

23:17.961 --> 23:21.704
Dr. Ramon Sierra
in Doctores Enamorados.

23:21.748 --> 23:26.187
I'm just so happy you're
all right. I was so scared.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.276
I know. Me, too.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.452
And I'm sorry I ruined
your wedding dress shopping...

23:30.496 --> 23:32.062
again.

23:33.890 --> 23:34.935
I'm your father.

23:38.721 --> 23:41.420
I want you guys to go.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.422
I want you to go. Go now.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.988
Wow.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.903
Oh, that feels like
a lifetime ago.

23:46.947 --> 23:51.168
I can't believe you've only been
in my life for seven years.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.996
You know, all the cells
in your body

23:53.040 --> 23:56.260
regenerate every seven years,
so technically

23:56.304 --> 23:58.959
you've known each other
your whole lives.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.004
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw. Look who's nerding out.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.093
I really hope she gets
into nursing school.

24:03.137 --> 24:05.095
Well, I need a lot more
lifetimes with you,

24:05.139 --> 24:06.706
so you have to manage
your stress.

24:06.749 --> 24:07.881
I will.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.841
So, is this your wedding dress?

24:11.885 --> 24:14.583
This? No. Ugh. I was trying
it on when I saw your video,

24:14.627 --> 24:16.455
and I didn't have
time to take it off.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.500
Oh, thank God,
because it's hideous.

24:22.635 --> 24:25.202
I brought
your clothes,

24:25.246 --> 24:27.117
but the bridal shop
made me give them

24:27.161 --> 24:28.728
a credit card
for the dress.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.078
Ugh, do I even want to know
how much I owe you?

24:33.646 --> 24:36.213
Oh.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.215
Ah, well,

24:38.259 --> 24:40.566
I'm either wearing this
to the wedding

24:40.609 --> 24:42.611
or living in it.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.531
Feels like the storm's
coming any minute, huh?

24:49.575 --> 24:52.273
Yeah, it's felt that way
the past few days.

24:52.316 --> 24:55.015
Maybe it'll pass.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.234
So, listen...
Look...

25:00.281 --> 25:03.589
I think I know why I freaked out
about telling the baby early

25:03.632 --> 25:05.721
about the egg donation.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.987
I know my dad so well now.

25:11.031 --> 25:14.643
Um, sometimes I forget
it was such a-a trauma

25:14.687 --> 25:19.996
when he came back and I realized
my mom had lied for so long.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.912
Oh, my God. I kind of
forgot about that.

25:24.392 --> 25:27.177
Me, too, actually.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.744
So, anyway, uh...

25:28.788 --> 25:30.659
that's why it's
really important to me

25:30.703 --> 25:32.705
that the baby know the truth
from the beginning.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.663
I get it.
And no problem.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.796
If we do this,
we'll tell the baby

25:36.839 --> 25:39.015
as soon as she's old
enough to understand.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.060
Thank you.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.976
And listen,
you're right.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.064
This isn't an ice cream.

25:44.107 --> 25:45.152
Milkshake.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.719
Whatever.

25:46.762 --> 25:49.112
The point is, it's
a really big deal.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.201
And I might
feel insecure,

25:51.245 --> 25:54.683
but you deserve the answers
to any questions you have.

25:54.727 --> 25:57.338
So pull out that list.

25:57.381 --> 26:00.210
I don't have a...
Jane.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.436
Okay, timing.
Okay.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.699
Would you want to do it
before or after the wedding?

26:10.743 --> 26:12.919
Up to you.
Great. I'd prefer
to do it after.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.224
Of course.

26:14.268 --> 26:17.227
Uh, s-so are you getting
married soon or...?

26:17.271 --> 26:18.707
Hopefully. Raf and I
have an appointment
Okay.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.405
with a minister in an hour
so that I can lock down a date.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.103
Got it. Perfect.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.322
Just curious. How many more
questions do you have?

26:25.366 --> 26:27.281
37.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.544
Mm. Okay.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.807
Let's do this.

26:31.851 --> 26:35.115
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here. Now.

26:35.158 --> 26:36.812
Raf, are you almost here?

26:36.856 --> 26:38.640
I am so sorry,
but I'm not gonna make

26:38.684 --> 26:40.033
the meeting with the minister.

26:40.076 --> 26:41.295
The meeting that starts
in one minute?

26:41.338 --> 26:43.166
I know, I feel terrible,

26:43.210 --> 26:46.039
but we're down to the wire
with prep for our Ludo meeting.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.650
I already rescheduled once.
There's no way you can get here?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.217
I'm sorry.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.522
But I trust your judgment,

26:51.566 --> 26:53.263
and if you like him,
we'll book him.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.874
Okay, I'll handle it.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.266
Did you e-mail me
your questionnaire?

26:56.310 --> 26:59.574
I didn't get to it.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.750
It's fine. I'll deal
with wedding stuff.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.317
Good luck on your meeting.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.058
Jane?

27:06.625 --> 27:09.323
Uh, will your fiancé
be joining us?

27:09.366 --> 27:11.586
Actually, uh, Raf got tied up
in a last-minute work thing.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.153
He's really sorry
he couldn't be here.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.981
No worries.
Life happens.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.723
I'm sure I will learn a lot
from his questionnaire.

27:17.766 --> 27:21.161
Right. Actually, Raf didn't have
a chance to finish his.

27:21.204 --> 27:25.252
It's just a-a really busy time
at work for him right now.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.602
He's actually got two jobs.I understand.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.171
But it's important that you two
are on the same page

27:31.214 --> 27:33.347
when it comes
to your priorities.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.871
Of course, 100%.
Don't worry,

27:35.915 --> 27:38.831
Raf and I are totally in sync
regarding priorities.

27:38.874 --> 27:41.703
Then again, he's not here,

27:41.747 --> 27:44.706
and he didn't
do the work.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.056
It might be prudent
to have a conversation

27:47.100 --> 27:49.102
about Rafael's commitment
to your family,

27:49.145 --> 27:50.973
if you want me to marry you.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.671
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.194
Are storm clouds gathering?

27:54.237 --> 27:55.630
Nope. False alarm.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.066
Just more thunder.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.459
Maybe the storm won't come.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.113
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Trust me, it will.

28:00.156 --> 28:01.984
Anyway,
to sum things up,

28:02.028 --> 28:03.420
we'd have a different chef
every month,

28:03.464 --> 28:04.944
and you would supervise
their menus.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.554
This may be
a kids' hotel,

28:06.597 --> 28:08.556
but those kids have
parents with good taste.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.123
And deep pockets.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.341
So, what do you think?

28:11.385 --> 28:14.736
I don't know,
it just feels... passé.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.607
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Maybe that means something
different in French.

28:16.651 --> 28:20.350
You know, boring,
played out, stale.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.439
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Guess not.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.311
I feel I've already
done the pop-up thing.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.574
Uh, wh-what if we
explored the idea

28:26.617 --> 28:29.708
of an exclusive
branded partnership?

28:29.751 --> 28:31.622
Yeah. What my colleague
is trying to say is,

28:31.666 --> 28:33.320
we know you've
done pop-ups before,

28:33.363 --> 28:34.495
but this would be

28:34.538 --> 28:36.105
a unique opportunity
to do that

28:36.149 --> 28:38.629
with your branding
inside a hotel.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.284
And, of course, I'd give you
a percentage of the revenue

28:41.328 --> 28:42.721
whenever guest
chefs came through.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.679
Okay, keep talking.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.512
What the hell were you thinking?

28:51.555 --> 28:53.122
What was I thinking?

28:53.166 --> 28:55.298
You totally undermined me.We discussed this.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.865
You had no right
to bring your idea

28:56.909 --> 28:58.301
into the conversation
without my permission.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.434
Your permission? If I'm
gonna help you with this,

29:00.477 --> 29:02.523
then I need to have a voice.You do have a voice.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.177
One that I can overrule
since it's my hotel.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.440
Your hotel? Seriously?Yes, seriously.

29:06.483 --> 29:09.138
After my sister took my shares
and you somehow got them back

29:09.182 --> 29:10.792
all for yourself?Oh, please.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.533
You wouldn't have been able
to open up so much

29:12.576 --> 29:14.753
as a food truck if it wasn't
for your rich daddy.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.233
When I got the Marbella, it was
in shambles, saddled in debt.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.366
You basically ran it
into the ground.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.976
I was the one who did
all the hard work

29:21.020 --> 29:22.456
to turn the Marbella
into something great,

29:22.499 --> 29:23.979
so I really don't need
your advice.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.676
If that's how you feel,

29:25.720 --> 29:27.243
then maybe we shouldn't
work together.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.418
There's the door.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.039
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, Jane finally had

29:40.082 --> 29:41.518
answers to all her questions.

29:41.562 --> 29:44.608
Except, you know,
the really big one.

29:44.652 --> 29:45.827
What do you think, Faith?

29:45.871 --> 29:48.177
If I give Lina the egg,
can I let go?

29:49.875 --> 29:52.486
Wow. Uh, Lina,
you guys are...

29:52.529 --> 29:54.662
Matching. Cute, right?

29:54.705 --> 29:56.838
Spiked heels
elongate the calves.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.057
LINA:
Work it, girl.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.407
No, stop.
Don't work it.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.408
RAFAEL:
Jane?

30:01.451 --> 30:02.626
Hey.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.846
How'd it go?Uh, not great.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.979
Petra and I got into it
over some hotel stuff.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.894
I'm sorry again
for missing the meeting.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.417
How was the minister?

30:10.460 --> 30:13.986
Oh, uh... Reverend Fairdale
didn't think

30:14.029 --> 30:16.205
he was the right fit for us,
but it's fine.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.991
There are plenty of other
officiants in the sea, right?

30:20.296 --> 30:22.037
Is it because I wasn't there?

30:22.081 --> 30:23.865
Of course not. It was just
a personality thing.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.998
Jane.It's fine. I promise.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.869
I'm gonna get some sleep.
I'm beat.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.874
I love your eggs, Mommy.
I want more.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.834
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Looks like everyone wants
Jane's eggs these days.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.445
But not the Lina eggs;
the scrambled ones.

30:39.881 --> 30:40.839
Yeah, I got that.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.231
Here you go, kiddo.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.885
And remember, when
you get to school,

30:43.929 --> 30:45.887
you need to let everyone
know you made a mistake

30:45.931 --> 30:47.236
and Mommy isn't pregnant.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.890
I'll remember.

30:48.934 --> 30:49.891
But, did you decide
if you're gonna do

30:49.935 --> 30:51.980
the egg thing for Lina?

30:53.373 --> 30:55.114
I'm still thinking about it.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.464
Because it's so complicated.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.683
Why do you even want
to do it, then?

31:00.946 --> 31:04.297
Because I love Auntie Lina
so much.

31:04.340 --> 31:07.822
And it would be
a gift to help her.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.085
And you were such
an unexpected gift for me.

31:10.129 --> 31:11.826
I want to pass that on.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.916
Because you have to
go the extra mile

31:14.960 --> 31:16.570
for the people you love.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.006
Even if it's hard.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.531
And no matter what
Lina's answers

31:21.575 --> 31:23.403
to those questions are...

31:23.446 --> 31:25.927
I know you'll raise your
kid with so much love,

31:25.971 --> 31:27.886
and that's
what matters.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.149
So, yes, I'll
give you my eggs.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.890
Wow.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.369
Thanks so, so much.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.936
But, actually,
I don't want them.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.938
What? Why not?

31:36.982 --> 31:37.983
No, they're really
great eggs.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.636
I mean, I-I
got pregnant

31:39.680 --> 31:42.161
literally the first time
sperm even touched one.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.945
And I really think
that I can let go.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.339
Yeah, but I don't know if I can.

31:46.382 --> 31:50.125
Look, you are this
amazing person and mother,

31:50.169 --> 31:53.650
and I was talking to Danny,
and I realize

31:53.694 --> 31:55.870
I'm just so extra sensitive
to your judgment

31:55.914 --> 31:58.003
because I look up
to you so much.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.919
Every time I make
a bad decision, I see your face.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.225
Can you imagine how much worse
it would be seeing it

32:03.269 --> 32:05.575
stare up at me out of a
five-year-old's body?

32:05.619 --> 32:07.316
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I mean, I can.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.231
Bad Mommy!

32:09.275 --> 32:11.103
I'll just ask one
of my sisters.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.713
I can handle their bitchiness.

32:12.756 --> 32:15.063
I just don't want
to complicate our friendship.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.760
It's too important to me.

32:16.804 --> 32:19.285
To me, too.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.113
But if you change your mind,

32:21.156 --> 32:22.897
know I would do it.Thanks.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.118
And all of your questions
did get me thinking.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.336
Mm.Danny and I

32:27.380 --> 32:29.382
would like it if you
were the baby's guardian

32:29.425 --> 32:31.036
if anything happened to us.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.996
Of course. I'd be honored.

32:36.563 --> 32:37.999
Okay, okay.
Enough crying.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.219
Okay.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.962
I have something for you.

32:45.354 --> 32:48.009
Oh, my God,
did you draw this?Yeah.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.402
A-And you don't have to wear it.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.752
But if you like it,
I can use that ugly button dress

32:51.795 --> 32:53.188
that you had to buy
as a foundation.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.364
This is my wedding dress.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.279
Really?It's perfect.

32:57.323 --> 33:00.021
I'm sending my mom a
picture of it right now.

33:00.065 --> 33:03.024
Oh. S-Sorry. One sec.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.809
Hey, listen, I know you said
it wasn't my fault

33:05.853 --> 33:08.464
that the reverend won't
marry us, but it obviously is.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.249
And, like you said,
sometimes you have to go

33:10.292 --> 33:12.077
the extra mile
for people that you love.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.036
So... I am heading over
to the church right now

33:15.080 --> 33:16.081
to get him back.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.778
What? What's wrong?

33:19.084 --> 33:21.738
Hey there. Thanks for giving me
a minute. I'm Rafael Solano.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.914
I'm Jane Villanueva's fiancé.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.221
I just wanted to bring
you my questionnaire.

33:26.265 --> 33:27.440
It's a little late.I know.

33:27.483 --> 33:28.876
And-and I know
how it must have looked

33:28.919 --> 33:30.138
when I didn't show up
for the appointment,

33:30.182 --> 33:31.618
and so I understand
why you turned us down,

33:31.661 --> 33:33.533
but I just really want...JANE: Can we, uh...

33:33.576 --> 33:35.883
talk outside for a second?What are you doing here?

33:35.926 --> 33:37.928
I didn't turn you down because
you missed the appointment.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.582
Your fiancée here
went off on me.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.109
It might be prudent
to have a conversation

33:44.152 --> 33:46.067
about Rafael's commitment
to your family,

33:46.111 --> 33:47.851
if you want me to marry you.

33:47.895 --> 33:50.071
Are you serious?
Excuse me?

33:50.115 --> 33:52.073
You have no idea
what that man's overcome

33:52.117 --> 33:54.684
and sacrificed
for our relationship,

33:54.728 --> 33:56.512
so don't you dare
question his commitment.

33:56.556 --> 33:59.254
I mean, you can't even commit
to a religion.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.082
What the heck
is Unitarian anyway?

34:01.126 --> 34:03.084
Wow! Ha!

34:04.129 --> 34:05.869
We're just gonna go.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.351
Well, thank you
for sticking up for me.

34:09.395 --> 34:12.354
Are you kidding me? After
everything you've gone through.

34:12.398 --> 34:15.270
I won't have anyone
doubting your commitment

34:15.314 --> 34:17.055
to me or our family.

34:17.098 --> 34:20.188
No one can be there
all the time, for everything.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.756
You're allowed to miss things
to chase your dreams.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.410
Thank you.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.412
Mm.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.196
You're a pretty great person.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.198
No wonder Lina wants your eggs.

34:30.242 --> 34:33.158
Oh, turns out
she doesn't want them anymore.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.855
Why not? You
have great eggs!

34:34.898 --> 34:37.031
I know.
That's what I said.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.120
But it just feels
too complicated for her.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.687
She's gonna ask
her sisters.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.254
Well, that makes it easier.

34:42.297 --> 34:43.994
Yeah. It really does.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.257
But, man, all that

34:45.300 --> 34:48.173
baby talk made me think
about our future baby

34:48.216 --> 34:49.826
and how I can't wait for that.

34:49.870 --> 34:52.916
So maybe we could talk about

34:52.960 --> 34:54.788
a timeline for adoption?

34:54.831 --> 34:58.835
Well, I've actually
also been thinking about that.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.622
And I realized that I...

35:02.665 --> 35:05.277
I definitely don't want
more kids.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.195
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And... there's our storm.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.639
You don't want
more kids?

35:19.682 --> 35:22.946
We talked. You said that
you were open to adoption.

35:22.990 --> 35:26.341
I-I was open to it.

35:26.385 --> 35:29.039
But all that Lina talk
just got me thinking.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.564
And... I'm already
spread so thin

35:31.607 --> 35:36.003
with work and three young
and complicated children.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.657
And...

35:37.700 --> 35:39.920
my life just feels full.

35:41.008 --> 35:44.098
Wow. Okay.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.752
So, what do we do now?

35:45.795 --> 35:47.362
What do you mean?

35:47.406 --> 35:50.626
I told you--
there are no deal breakers.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.193
We're getting married.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.890
And if you don't want
more kids,

35:53.934 --> 35:56.632
then we won't have them.

35:56.676 --> 35:57.459
I'm sorry.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.809
I wish I felt differently.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.202
It's okay.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.639
Uh, I mean,
I'm a little sad,

36:03.683 --> 36:05.075
but I get it.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.729
Besides,

36:06.773 --> 36:09.515
one of us may change
our mind someday.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.561
Yeah. You might.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.738
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

36:15.782 --> 36:18.132
one of them eventually would.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.569
I won't tell you who,
but you can probably guess.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.137
See? Look how good
we are at communicating.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.140
That Reverend Fairdale
is a big, dumb bozo.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.320
Like you said,
probably not a great fit.

36:35.889 --> 36:38.370
We can never go back to
this church!

36:41.199 --> 36:42.504
Mmm.I love you.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.245
I love you, too,
but I'm soaked,

36:44.289 --> 36:45.855
so can we get
in the car?

36:45.899 --> 36:47.292
Yeah, sorry, sorry! Here.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.209
Under the car!

36:51.252 --> 36:52.645
Got 'em!

36:52.688 --> 36:54.429
Uh, never mind!
Don't got 'em!

36:54.473 --> 36:55.778
Aah!

36:57.302 --> 36:58.390
Aha!

36:58.433 --> 37:00.479
Quick, get in the car
before we get wet!

37:05.005 --> 37:06.920
What happened?

37:06.963 --> 37:08.748
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Despite spending an average of

37:08.791 --> 37:11.490
94 minutes a day in the gym,
your father is sort of clumsy.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.535
We, uh, weathered
a storm.

37:14.928 --> 37:17.670
Welcome back from
the hospital, Papa!

37:17.713 --> 37:20.847
Matelio! Your smiling face
warms my heart.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.283
But this is
totally unnecessary.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.458
I told you guys,

37:23.502 --> 37:24.459
I'm fine.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.338
Ooh.

37:33.381 --> 37:34.600
Mm.

38:17.817 --> 38:18.992
Oh. Salud.

38:19.035 --> 38:20.602
Many salud.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.604
XIOMARA:
Many salud.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.128
What's with the smirk?

38:25.172 --> 38:26.260
It's not a smirk.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.522
It's a smile.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.524
I've got an idea.

38:29.568 --> 38:30.960
About our officiant.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.269
Yes, that's brilliant.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.316
Abuela,

38:38.359 --> 38:41.014
we would love it
if you would marry us.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.898
Oh.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.514
I want to let all my Rogeli-fans
know that I am fine.

39:02.557 --> 39:05.038
That last post
gave us all quite a scare,

39:05.081 --> 39:07.127
but it was also
an important reminder

39:07.170 --> 39:10.565
that life is short and precious.

39:10.609 --> 39:13.394
More than a career

39:13.438 --> 39:15.962
or fame, what truly keeps
my heart beating

39:16.005 --> 39:17.442
is the people
I love.

39:17.485 --> 39:20.183
Which is why I'm signing off

39:20.227 --> 39:22.751
and letting this pilot thing go.

39:22.795 --> 39:25.406
It's in the hands of God.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.626
And the studio executives.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.501
That was beautiful,
Rogelio.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.198
Thank you.

39:35.242 --> 39:36.635
I didn't mean a word.

39:36.678 --> 39:39.202
I want American superstardom
more than ever.

39:39.246 --> 39:40.595
I know.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.423
But, look, babe,

39:42.467 --> 39:44.425
you have to find a way
to de-stress.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.861
It's bad for your health.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.733
And you have to listen to me,

39:47.776 --> 39:49.082
because...

39:50.126 --> 39:52.825
...I got into nursing school.

39:52.868 --> 39:53.956
What?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.524
I just got the e-mail.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.009
I'm so happy for you
that I actually do feel

40:03.052 --> 40:04.010
a little calmer.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.011
You're a liar.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.708
Maybe,
but I love you,

40:06.752 --> 40:08.493
and I'm so proud of you.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.018
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from one happy couple

40:12.061 --> 40:13.019
to another.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.673
Okay. Officiant, check.

40:14.716 --> 40:17.240
Sayonara, list one.

40:17.284 --> 40:19.242
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Only 14 more lists to go.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.244
Mm, that's why
I'm marrying you.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.246
Hot checklist pillow talk.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.335
Ooh.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.512
I'm sorry.
I'm just excited. I'm...

40:27.555 --> 40:29.775
Everything's
finally coming together.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.777
It is, except
one thing.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.344
My best man isn't
speaking to me.

40:35.955 --> 40:37.522
Because you overstepped.

40:37.565 --> 40:41.917
Whatever happened in the past,
it is her hotel now.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.136
Her baby.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.964
You have to let go, too.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.490
Rafael. Hi.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.710
Listen, I was angry and...

40:51.753 --> 40:52.841
No, I get why.

40:52.885 --> 40:54.147
I overstepped.
And for this to work,

40:54.190 --> 40:55.975
you have to
be the boss.

40:56.018 --> 40:58.194
That's true. But, also,

40:58.238 --> 41:00.240
look, I've just been on my own
for a while,

41:00.283 --> 41:02.068
so it's hard
to let someone else in.

41:02.111 --> 41:03.591
But I do want your ideas,
and I think

41:03.635 --> 41:04.940
we could really do
great things together.

41:04.984 --> 41:05.985
And that's what I want.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.900
Me, too.

41:07.943 --> 41:09.902
But, also,
our family's come a long way,

41:09.945 --> 41:12.034
and I don't want to risk that.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.688
Me, either. So...

41:13.732 --> 41:15.951
if things get weird,

41:15.995 --> 41:17.953
I will step away.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.259
PETRA:
Sounds good.

41:19.302 --> 41:20.913
Okay, I'll talk to you
in the morning, okay?

41:20.956 --> 41:22.088
Yeah. Bye, Petra.

41:22.131 --> 41:24.743
Bye.

41:24.786 --> 41:26.527
Mother!

41:26.571 --> 41:28.616
What the hell are
you doing in my car?!

41:28.660 --> 41:30.531
I heard you got
your hotel back.

41:30.575 --> 41:32.533
You need to help
your mother.

41:32.577 --> 41:33.926
Oh, please. I'm-I'm not...

41:33.969 --> 41:36.929
Think very carefully
before you speak, Petra.

41:36.972 --> 41:39.453
I tell fortunes,
and I read yours.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.889
And if you
do not help me,

41:40.933 --> 41:42.325
something terrible...
