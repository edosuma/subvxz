WEBVTT

00:07.181 --> 00:10.967
Fosse/Verdon. All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.316 --> 00:15.058
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.717
NANDOR:
Guillermo, I want you to go

00:21.760 --> 00:23.240
tomorrow, and I want you to get

00:23.284 --> 00:26.069
some of those things
that humans use for smelling.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.332
Rhymes with "hoses."

00:28.376 --> 00:29.855
Noses?

00:29.899 --> 00:31.944
NANDOR:
No. It's a green, spiky stick.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.859
You know, with the colors
on the top.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.731
You got the red.
"I love you.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.733
-Here's some..."
-Roses.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.300
NANDOR:
Roses, yes.

00:39.343 --> 00:43.086
The Baron's attic has got a bitof a dank whiff.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.305
Since the Baron arrived,

00:44.348 --> 00:46.046
things have been very stressful.

00:48.004 --> 00:50.311
That's our familiar.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.313
NANDOR:
He's staying in our attic
at the moment, and

00:52.356 --> 00:56.491
that's a lot of storage space
that we-we can't use.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.449
When is he going
to leave, anyway?

00:58.493 --> 00:59.929
Shh, Nadja!

00:59.972 --> 01:02.236
Guillermo.

01:04.368 --> 01:05.543
Well, pull it, then.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.329
-NADJA: Oh!
-Too loud!

01:08.372 --> 01:09.765
-He needs to pipe down
with that.
-Yes.

01:09.808 --> 01:11.723
-When will he leave?
-Shh.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.117
Nadja, you must keep
your voice down, my darling.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.511
Oh, for goodness' sake,
I'm not scared of him.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.513
-Oh...

01:20.558 --> 01:23.039
The Baron has awakened?

01:27.043 --> 01:30.177
Sorry, was that a yes?

01:31.830 --> 01:33.136
-LASZLO: Was it a nod?
-No, I asked and she went,

01:33.180 --> 01:34.920
she went and did this.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.226
That is a nod,
I've seen her do it before.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.749
What, this? Like this?

01:37.793 --> 01:39.273
-He's awake.
-COLIN: He's awake.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.752
Oh, he's awake.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.928
All right, I-I can feel

01:42.972 --> 01:45.496
his energy, it's very dark
and angry, and I think

01:45.540 --> 01:48.369
it's pointed at you guys.

01:48.412 --> 01:49.544
Hate to be you guys.

02:25.449 --> 02:29.758
In Europe, a couple of centuries
ago, the Baron was a fun guy.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.587
And we got up to some
very messy business together.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.415
-Yes.
-Problem is,

02:34.458 --> 02:36.199
he's turned up recently

02:36.243 --> 02:39.811
with what only can be describedas pretty old-fashioned ideas.

02:39.855 --> 02:43.380
He's obsessed with the idea ofvampires taking over all humans,

02:43.424 --> 02:46.209
which, at first, you're like,
"Oh, that's a cool idea,"

02:46.253 --> 02:48.777
but then, after a while,
it's like,

02:48.820 --> 02:50.779
"Sorry, why are we doing this?"

02:50.822 --> 02:52.998
Yeah.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.348
You can bet your balls
he's gonna be furious

02:54.391 --> 02:56.001
we haven't come up
with a conquering plan.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.220
NANDOR:
Maybe he's not angry.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.656
Maybe he's just wanting a chat?

02:58.700 --> 03:01.355
Get up with the latest
vampire gossip.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.791
--That's highly unlucky, Nandor.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.358
The man's a fucking psychopath.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.011
I think he's going
to kill us all.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.361
That's more likely.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.363
Baron, we are here.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.669
But there's really no needfor any kind of grand entrance.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.629
Or j-just do your bit--
that's fine, too.

03:17.675 --> 03:21.070
♪ In nomine Patris...♪

03:21.113 --> 03:23.028
My slumber is...

03:23.072 --> 03:24.116
complete.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.379
Great.
Uh, we weren't sure

03:25.422 --> 03:27.468
that you wanted us
to conquer the whole

03:27.511 --> 03:29.644
of North America, or just, you
know, maybe a couple streets?

03:29.687 --> 03:31.863
Silence!

03:31.907 --> 03:35.824
I have heard so much of
the wonders of this New World,

03:35.867 --> 03:39.262
yet I have seen of it
not but this attic.

03:39.306 --> 03:42.483
Uh, would you like us
to get you a TV?

03:42.526 --> 03:43.875
No.

03:43.919 --> 03:46.661
I want to see the sights.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.663
-I want a night on the town.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.274
A night on the town?

03:51.318 --> 03:53.102
Really? I mean,
won't that be a bit difficult

03:53.145 --> 03:54.146
with your, um...?

03:55.583 --> 03:56.497
Oh.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.499
You were saying?

03:58.542 --> 04:03.112
: No, but I'm sure
we can help you fit in.

04:04.592 --> 04:05.854
Marvelous.

04:05.897 --> 04:09.292
-Ah, relax.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.860
This is going to be fun.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.078
No.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.515
Oh, that's the documentary crew.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.523
We are so sorry that...

04:22.566 --> 04:25.917
our houseguest ate
your sound recordist.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.963
NADJA:
This... what is this
"conquering America" stuff?

04:28.006 --> 04:29.443
He's going to get us killed.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.445
Not unless he tries
to kill us himself first.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.577
-He threw me
straight across the room.
-Most importantly, we are...

04:35.362 --> 04:36.450
...that he ate
your sound recordist.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.538
That was very...

04:38.582 --> 04:41.106
Yeah. Wasn't very cool.
We'll, uh,

04:41.150 --> 04:43.326
we'll make sure
we look after you people.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.762
And how are we going to do that?

04:44.806 --> 04:46.198
I don't know, uh...

04:51.029 --> 04:52.596
NADJA:
Of course it's a trap.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.337
Why would the Baron want
to go on a night out?

04:54.381 --> 04:56.426
Because he wants to know howmuch of America we've conquered.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.341
And when he finds out thatwe've just conquered our street

04:58.385 --> 05:00.474
and part of Ashley Street,
he's going to kill us.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.737
But if we seriously think
he's gonna "quack" us...

05:02.780 --> 05:04.782
-NADJA: Which we do.
-...then we should
"quack" him first.

05:04.826 --> 05:07.132
You want us to quackhim?

05:07.176 --> 05:10.701
If you think he's gonna
"whack" us first, yes.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.922
Laszlo, be quiet. We will not
discuss this any further.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.489
It is the greatest violation

05:15.532 --> 05:18.492
of the unnatural order
by which we live.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.581
Also, can he even die?

05:20.624 --> 05:22.757
-NADJA: Oh, my...

05:22.800 --> 05:24.149
NANDOR:
You happy now? You just scared

05:24.193 --> 05:25.499
the shit out of all three of us?

05:25.542 --> 05:26.978
Hmm? You don't knock anymore?

05:27.022 --> 05:29.372
Is this the new you? Hmm?

05:29.416 --> 05:31.505
Sorry, I just wanted to inform
you that the Baron's ready.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.158
-Oh.
-NADJA: God...

05:33.202 --> 05:34.508
He's really terrifying.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.162
Yes, okay, well, we all are,
we are vampires.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.381
Well...

05:38.425 --> 05:40.470
-Eh.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.953
Get out.

05:44.996 --> 05:47.259
We shall call this night
Operation...

05:47.303 --> 05:49.610
Accidentally Kill the Baron.

05:49.653 --> 05:53.048
Absolutely not. At least think
of a different name.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.399
This conversation
never happened.

06:06.496 --> 06:09.281
She keeps looking at me.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.503
Don't look at her.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.031
Bloody hell,
he's wearing two ruffs.

06:20.075 --> 06:25.515
-Let our grand evening
on the town commence.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.995
-NADJA: Yes! Very good.
- Yes.

06:27.038 --> 06:30.825
Yes, uh, this is what
you're going to wear?

06:31.695 --> 06:33.871
Is it not right?

06:33.915 --> 06:37.571
Y-Yes, I mean, you look
the... dog's knackers.

06:37.614 --> 06:41.052
But, um, where we come from,
two ruffs

06:41.096 --> 06:43.228
means you're up for anything.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.796
Uh, it's best just to kind ofblend in like-- like we are now.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.624
Yes.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.844
Yes, I see.

06:49.887 --> 06:53.674
I want to walk amongst
the commoners unnoticed.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.632
-NADJA: Yes.
-A prince amongst paupers.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.591
-NADJA: Yes, very good.
Very good.
-NANDOR: Exactly.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.071
Two ruffs don't make a right.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.728
Colin Robinson.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.905
Oh, wow. Uh... hello.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.820
NANDOR:You wouldn't happen to have any

07:09.864 --> 07:13.302
human-type clothes
to lend to the Baron?

07:13.345 --> 07:16.827
Uh, yeah, I-I could
scrounge something up.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.046
What size are you?

07:18.089 --> 07:19.700
Mm, this size.

07:19.743 --> 07:23.268
And what kind of vibe
are-are you going for?

07:23.312 --> 07:27.055
Jeans, T-shirt? Are you a jeansand T-shirt type of guy?

07:27.098 --> 07:28.709
Probably not shorts.

07:28.752 --> 07:33.278
Um, maybe some cords,
some w-wale cords.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.280
He is not coming along, is he?

07:35.324 --> 07:37.500
I will take care of it.

07:37.544 --> 07:41.112
Oh, okay. But don't make
a big thing out of it.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.897
-Mm?
-Okay.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.640
LASZLO:
Vampires have hidden
amongst humans

07:46.683 --> 07:48.337
for millennia.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.600
There are some in the community that believe

07:50.644 --> 07:53.734
that vampires
should rule the world.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.518
One such person

07:55.562 --> 07:56.737
is the Baron.

07:56.780 --> 07:59.087
And he's become a massive prick.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.306
Absolutely agree.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.353
LASZLO:
Which is ironic,
because he doesn't have one.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.664
Where is he?

08:10.707 --> 08:13.144
He was right behind us.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.798
-LASZLO: Ah.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.887
NANDOR:
He's going to frighten
the townspeople.

08:16.931 --> 08:20.108
-Oh.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.197
-LASZLO: Um...
-MAN: Holy shit.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.329
A lot of these buildings
are, uh, are taverns,

08:24.373 --> 08:26.767
-or bars as they call them.
-NADJA: Don't mind him.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.116
-WOMAN: Did you see that?
-Why are these pedestrians

08:28.159 --> 08:29.378
making rictus faces at us?

08:29.421 --> 08:30.597
MAN 2:
Oh, my God.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.424
Devils suck, man.

08:32.468 --> 08:33.425
We are vampires!

08:33.469 --> 08:34.601
Shh! What are you doing?

08:34.644 --> 08:36.777
He is literally going around,

08:36.820 --> 08:40.128
telling everyone, "Nice to meetyou, I am vampire."

08:40.171 --> 08:41.912
And, you know,
there's only so many times

08:41.956 --> 08:44.741
you can say that he's joking,
because look at his face.

08:44.785 --> 08:48.179
-Yo, Laz. Nadja. Whoa...

08:48.223 --> 08:51.792
I was just, uh, stocking upon some brews for the big game.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.968
Who is this guy?

08:54.011 --> 08:56.144
NADJA:
No, no, no. This is
our neighbor Sean, sire.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.798
NANDOR:
He brings our trash cans in

08:57.841 --> 08:59.756
when we forget them.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.978
What the fuck? How did he...?

09:04.021 --> 09:05.588
LASZLO:
Shut up.
You won't remember anything

09:05.632 --> 09:08.591
from the last five minutes.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.767
Yo, Laz, Nadja.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.943
I was just going to stock up
on some more brews.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.424
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
-LASZLO: No, no, no, no...

09:16.904 --> 09:18.732
BARON:
We will fill this place

09:18.775 --> 09:21.430
with the carcasses
of the conquered.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.954
Some humans will become slaves.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.435
The rest, food.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.872
Slave.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.874
WOMAN :
Pharmacy, pick up
line three, please.

09:30.918 --> 09:31.875
Pharmacy, line three.

09:33.442 --> 09:34.835
Food.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.185
He's as mad as a wax banana.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.187
-He's a fucking liability.
-I think it might be

09:39.230 --> 09:40.754
better if he dies.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.887
How about we just put his coffinon a nice, long ocean journey?

09:43.931 --> 09:46.977
Look at this wonderful talisman.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.240
-Whoop.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.765
Need I haggle
with the proprietor?

09:51.808 --> 09:54.855
-Just put it in your pocket.
-Hmm. It is done.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.902
BARON:
Let us see, what to drink.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.643
What to...

10:03.472 --> 10:04.473
-LASZLO: Oh, no, no.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.825
NANDOR:Oh, give him a nice hug from us.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.827
-Is he okay? I...
-NADJA: Ha, ha.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.873
Whoa, dear. Hi.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.440
The Baron is being
very loud and obvious

10:15.484 --> 10:18.922
and vampirey and reckless.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.795
He had
a very high alcohol content.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.449
Do you think maybe
we should move the body?

10:24.493 --> 10:27.061
Now he's just gone up
to a drunk man

10:27.104 --> 10:28.932
and he's drunk
the drunk man's blood

10:28.976 --> 10:31.065
that has made him drunk.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.241
Okay. That's a...

10:33.284 --> 10:34.895
Just a little dizzy. Okay.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.288
-A little dizzy, little dizzy.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.337
I am better.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.469
Back in the saddle.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.384
The drinking saddle!

10:47.516 --> 10:48.735
That was bollocks.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.525
♪ We need you now...♪

10:56.568 --> 10:58.962
You people are as much fun
as the plague.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.051
Remember the plague?
And how much fun it was?

11:01.095 --> 11:02.531
That's this.

11:02.574 --> 11:05.273
-Let's liven this place up.
-Not too lively.

11:05.316 --> 11:09.277
It's very important to just
blend in and go with the flow.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.713
Or we could do shots.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.107
Shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots,

11:13.150 --> 11:15.500
shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots,

11:15.544 --> 11:16.937
shots, shots, shots, shots.

11:18.765 --> 11:19.896
LASZLO:
For God's sake.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.986
Oh, who wants a shot?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.509
We could do shots.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.862
Just a minute.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.734
-And I said,

11:31.778 --> 11:34.911
"No, how do you like
yourstakes?"

11:34.955 --> 11:38.001
And pushed itright through his stupid heart.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.136
You know I'm not really a baron.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.746
NANDOR :
Yes, you are.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.748
You're the Baron.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.969
No, I am not. It was a nickname.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.753
To tease me.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.625
Barren, B-A-R-R-E-N.

11:53.669 --> 11:54.757
Huh.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.846
Because I cannot sire offspring

11:56.890 --> 11:59.893
due to my lack of genitals.

11:59.936 --> 12:02.199
-Hello-- whoop!
-There it isn't.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.766
NADJA:
I like it.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.987
All I ever wanted
was a child of my own.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.426
Well, I don't know, Baron.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.385
Maybe we could be your children.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.561
-NADJA: Yes.
-Yes.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.998
-Yes.
-Also, maybe

12:18.041 --> 12:20.217
you want to pull
your pants back up now or...?

12:20.261 --> 12:22.393
Hmm? Oh, of course.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.613
NADJA:
Aw...

12:28.965 --> 12:31.011
NADJA:
The Baron,

12:31.054 --> 12:33.013
he told us very sad story.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.929
We might not kill him now--

12:35.972 --> 12:37.931
no, not going to kill him.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.412
BARON:
It's just hard.

12:41.456 --> 12:45.025
I used to derive such pleasure
from killing,

12:45.068 --> 12:46.940
but now... it's just a thing

12:46.983 --> 12:50.813
I do because... why?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.815
Because I've always
done it, I guess?

12:52.859 --> 12:56.253
And these dark rages
that overtake me,

12:56.297 --> 12:58.690
oh, my mind is devouring itself.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.040
Aw...

13:00.083 --> 13:01.476
We're all going through shit.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.217
It's hard doing what we do.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.175
BARON:
You know...

13:05.219 --> 13:07.177
this is going
to sound odd, but...

13:07.221 --> 13:09.049
I was thinking of killing
all of you tonight.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.180
NADJA:
Ah.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.008
-Yeah, yeah, I was.
-Ah.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.836
BARON:
What have I become?

13:19.233 --> 13:20.930
Guess what.

13:23.672 --> 13:26.414
We were going to kill you
tonight, too.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.725
NANDOR:
We were going to kill you!

13:33.769 --> 13:36.685
It was, it was Laszlo's idea.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.209
-Yeah, it was.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.645
He had the stake,

13:40.689 --> 13:42.082
-the...

13:42.125 --> 13:43.997
...stake...

13:44.998 --> 13:47.478
I beg your pardon?

13:47.522 --> 13:48.915
NANDOR:
Uh...

13:48.958 --> 13:50.525
LASZLO:
He was just joking, it was,

13:50.568 --> 13:52.875
it was just an idea
that we were kicking upstream.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.964
NANDOR:
Was more of a "what if"
situation.

13:55.008 --> 13:58.663
-Like, "What if?" and then "No."-Shut up.

14:00.361 --> 14:03.538
You... "kicked upstream"

14:03.581 --> 14:06.671
the idea of killing...

14:06.715 --> 14:08.108
me?

14:08.151 --> 14:10.675
As a joke. Nothing more.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.112
NADJA:
Just a-- a laugh.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.156
NANDOR:
Nothing happened.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.689
LASZLO:
Oh...

14:24.733 --> 14:26.343
-Your faces!
-Oh, the Baron...

14:26.387 --> 14:27.779
-Oh...
-You shithead.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.694
BARON:
Oh, I am proud of you.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.696
If I were you, I would have
done the same thing.

14:33.089 --> 14:34.351
BARON:
Where is next?

14:34.395 --> 14:36.266
You know what I have
always wanted to try?

14:36.310 --> 14:37.964
-Coprophilia.
-No.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.574
Pizza pie.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.098
Is it as wonderful
as they sa...?

14:42.142 --> 14:43.926
Coprophilia?

14:43.970 --> 14:45.710
Sire, this is an even worse idea

14:45.754 --> 14:47.582
than when we tried
to invade Vienna.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.105
It's certainly going
to make you very ill.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.194
I'm having pizza pie.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.762
Oh, no, no, no.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.331
Mmm.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.334
Mmm.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.944
The garlic burnt a little,
but...

15:07.384 --> 15:09.082
Down he goes.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.779
-NANDOR: He's up again.

15:10.822 --> 15:11.780
NADJA:
The Baron has eaten

15:11.823 --> 15:13.956
some human food and now his body

15:14.000 --> 15:16.611
is being propelled around
by his own vomit.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.091
-LASZLO: Is he all right?-NANDOR: Now, where's he going?

15:18.134 --> 15:19.788
NADJA:
So, that's what's happening

15:19.831 --> 15:21.137
