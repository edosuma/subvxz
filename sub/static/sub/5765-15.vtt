WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.029
Previously on The Good Wife:
Should we tell Mom?

00:03.070 --> 00:06.631
They sent them to Mom
to hurt her, so I say no.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.797
You, Mr. Florrick, have
been granted a retrial.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.501
Yes.

00:10.540 --> 00:13.134
(gallery exclaims)

00:13.180 --> 00:15.273
ZACH:
He's taking pictures
of our front door.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.107
So who is it?

00:17.810 --> 00:19.118
I don't know.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.485
Maybe we should just
get on with our d...
(knocking)

00:29.530 --> 00:32.090
Here we go.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.066
I love you both.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.208
(softly):
Hi.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.673
Hi.

01:05.860 --> 01:06.827
Hey, Dad.

01:06.860 --> 01:09.055
Zach.

01:09.870 --> 01:10.825
Come here.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.065
(chuckles)

01:16.870 --> 01:18.838
Hi, Grace.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.703
We made you a cake.

01:21.740 --> 01:26.109
Would that be
an upside-down pineapple cake?

01:31.290 --> 01:32.848
Aw...

01:33.890 --> 01:36.120
SHERIFF:
It must remain connected

01:36.160 --> 01:39.129
at all times to your phone.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.320
Any tampering results

01:40.360 --> 01:43.363
in immediate termination
of the program.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.560
The transmitter

01:44.600 --> 01:46.739
is to be worn around
your ankle at all times.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.260
It's waterproof
and shockproof.

01:48.300 --> 01:51.303
It sends a signal to the
HMD every five minutes.

01:51.340 --> 01:53.638
It must not cross this line.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.329
If you accidentally
cross the line...

01:55.380 --> 01:56.347
(alarm beeping)

01:56.380 --> 01:57.472
...you'll hear
an alarm

01:57.510 --> 01:59.171
(alarm stops)
then you'll receive
a telephone call

01:59.220 --> 02:00.209
from our monitoring center.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.344
You need to answer that
call within five rings

02:03.390 --> 02:04.743
or you're terminated
from the program.

02:04.790 --> 02:05.745
Do you understand?

02:05.790 --> 02:07.382
I understand.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.282
It's okay.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.594
You are confined to the
apartment 24 hours a clay.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.292
There is no use of cell
phones or Internet-based

02:16.330 --> 02:18.423
communications,
passive or active.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.438
No e-mail, no Web surfing.

02:20.470 --> 02:21.664
How will you know?

02:21.700 --> 02:22.667
Zach.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.928
No Internet communications.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.335
Will that be a problem?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.404
No.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.839
Now I need to attach the
transmitter to your ankle.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.177
Do you want to...?

02:30.210 --> 02:32.246
Right over here.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.918
Excuse me.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.577
Let me know
if this is too tight.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.748
It's just like
Cinderella.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.623
PETER: _
You're really all right

02:43.660 --> 02:44.729
with all of this?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.694
Yeah, yeah, it's cool.

02:46.730 --> 02:47.492
I was doing some research

02:47.530 --> 02:49.259
on who else
was under house arrest.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.838
Um... Aung Suu Kyi,
Roman Polanski.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.735
(chuckles)
Okay, Zach.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.567
Hey, Dad, there's something
that I want to show you

02:56.610 --> 02:57.599
on my computer.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.607
ALICIA:
Grace,

02:58.640 --> 03:01.438
will you help me
with the dishes?

03:01.480 --> 03:02.742
Maybe tomorrow after school.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.704
Sure. I'm not going anywhere.

03:07.750 --> 03:11.789
I like it-- the apartment.

03:15.490 --> 03:18.687
It's a fifth
the size.

03:18.730 --> 03:19.992
Do you miss the house?

03:20.030 --> 03:22.294
No.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.321
Sometimes.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.300
(sighs)

03:31.810 --> 03:34.631
I have to_ work in
the morning, so...

03:34.680 --> 03:36.272
(chuckles)

03:36.310 --> 03:37.641
It's weird, isn't it?

03:37.680 --> 03:40.012
You're going to work,
I'm staying home.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.574
(chuckles)

03:41.620 --> 03:43.645
Yeah.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.949
It's good to
have you home.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.489
MAN:
What was the first thing I saw?

03:59.540 --> 04:02.964
Well, I guess it was the body.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.604
And this was the victim,
Miles Wagner?

04:05.640 --> 04:06.834
Yes, sir.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.370
MAN:
I'm glad he's dead!

04:08.410 --> 04:09.604
I should have
done it myself!

04:09.650 --> 04:10.708
MAN 2:
He deserved it!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.775
I hope you rot in Hell, Wagner.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.811
Shenﬁs.
(gavelbangs)

04:14.850 --> 04:16.943
Members of the jury,
you are again instructed

04:16.990 --> 04:18.719
to disregard
these outbursts.

04:18.750 --> 04:19.819
I'm sorry. Mr. Landry.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.589
As you were saying, Detective.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.053
Mr. Wagner owns
Linked Asset Management

04:23.090 --> 04:24.682
on the 75th floor,

04:24.730 --> 04:26.618
and it appeared he
was gunned down

04:26.660 --> 04:28.719
as he was walking
to his car.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.364
What else did you find
at the scene, Detective?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.664
Well... him.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.792
Brad Broussard.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.467
Covered in blood.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.899
And how did he kill Wagner?

04:36.940 --> 04:38.828
Objection.
Withdrawn.

04:38.870 --> 04:41.703
How was Wagner killed?

04:41.740 --> 04:42.946
Two 9mm bullets

04:42.980 --> 04:44.675
in the torso,
one point-blank

04:44.710 --> 04:45.699
in his neck.

04:45.750 --> 04:46.944
MAN:
Way to go, Brad!

04:46.980 --> 04:48.811
(gavelbangs)

04:48.850 --> 04:50.738
WOMAN:
You'll show Brad?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.314
Yes, but I think you should.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.384
He wanted a girl.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.411
It's, uh, it's
not a girl.

04:56.690 --> 04:59.853
Men don't know
what they want.
(chuckles)

04:59.900 --> 05:01.925
Uh, d-do you think

05:01.960 --> 05:03.928
he'll ever get out on bail?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.858
We're trying.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.629
And visitation?

05:07.670 --> 05:09.467
It's hard.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.863
Because we're not married?

05:13.140 --> 05:14.903
You-you'll give it to him?

05:15.940 --> 05:17.805
LANDRY:
Now, the accused was

05:17.850 --> 05:19.579
Mr. Wagner's
bodyguard?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.110
DETECTIVE:
Yes, snr.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.549
And did he carry a gun?

05:22.590 --> 05:24.546
Yes, a 9mm.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.888
The same as the murder weapon.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.787
Now, did Mr. Broussard
seem agitated

05:29.830 --> 05:30.785
when you questioned him?

05:30.830 --> 05:31.888
He did.

05:31.930 --> 05:34.023
He had been encouraged to
invest his life savings

05:34.060 --> 05:36.790
with Mr. Wagner, and,
well, that was lost, too.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.366
WOMAN:
Yeah, he lost mine, too!

05:38.400 --> 05:39.594
(gavelbangs)
JUDGE:
Order!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.699
Lost with the rest
of his investments?

05:41.740 --> 05:43.605
Could you explain?

05:43.640 --> 05:46.473
Mr. Wagner and a partner
ran a mutual fund,

05:46.510 --> 05:47.909
which was one
of the largest feeders

05:47.940 --> 05:49.601
to Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.471
And that was, in your opinion,
Mr. Broussard's motive?

05:52.520 --> 05:53.839
Yes.

05:53.880 --> 05:54.847
Thank you, Detective.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.586
(gallery murmuring)

05:56.620 --> 05:57.746
ALICIA (whispers):
Brad.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.587
Hey. Where's Judith?

05:59.620 --> 06:02.009
She'll be in in a minute.
She wanted you to have that.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.379
It's a boy.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.421
JUDGE:
Order. Order.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.553
He's so beautiful.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.160
Detective, let's return
to this motive, shall we?

06:10.200 --> 06:13.135
Mr. Wagner lost my client's
life savings of $98,000?

06:13.170 --> 06:14.762
Is that correct?

06:14.800 --> 06:15.835
I'm not aware of the amount.

06:15.870 --> 06:16.837
Well, I am.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.906
It was $98,000.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.398
And yet, do you know how
much Mr. Wagner lost for his

06:22.450 --> 06:23.701
other clients?

06:23.750 --> 06:26.469
No, ma'am.
$800 million.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.647
Your Honor, does Ms. Lockhart
actually need a witness?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.908
In the form of an objection,
Mr. Landry.

06:29.950 --> 06:31.838
Argumentative.
Overruled.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.778
Half the people in this court
are here because Mr. Wagner

06:33.820 --> 06:35.481
lost their savings.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.748
Objection.

06:36.790 --> 06:37.927
Withdrawn.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.927
But, Detective,

06:38.960 --> 06:43.624
if having your savings
devastated by Mr. Wagner

06:43.670 --> 06:47.538
constitutes motive, aren't there
thousands of suspects?

06:47.570 --> 06:49.959
Ma'am, thousands of suspects
weren't seen entering

06:50.010 --> 06:51.898
the parking garage
at the time of the murder.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.704
Thousands of suspects
didn't own the murder weapon.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.641
Now, this 9mm gun
owned by Brad...

06:57.680 --> 06:58.647
did you ever find it?

06:58.680 --> 06:59.772
No.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.879
And the $50,000 in cash

07:01.920 --> 07:04.582
that Miles Wagner
was carrying that night...

07:04.620 --> 07:06.019
did you find that on the scene?

07:06.050 --> 07:06.948
No.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.810
Any theories on how my client

07:08.860 --> 07:11.556
got rid of the gun
and the money?
No, ma'am.

07:11.590 --> 07:14.229
And when you arrived at the
scene and you found my client,

07:14.260 --> 07:16.922
as you say,
"covered with blood,"

07:16.970 --> 07:18.528
what did you find him doing?

07:18.570 --> 07:19.730
I don't understand.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.988
Did you find him choking
Mr. Wagner,

07:22.040 --> 07:23.928
firing bullets into his body?

07:23.970 --> 07:24.959
No.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.638
Then what did
you find him doing?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.147
Applying CPR.

07:31.180 --> 07:32.670
And do you consider that

07:32.720 --> 07:33.869
a fairly common
M0 for a killer?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.842
Argumentative.
That's fine,
Your Honor.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.040
I don't have
anything more.

07:37.090 --> 07:37.886
So where are we

07:37.920 --> 07:39.911
on other suspects?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.951
Well, in most cases
we'd be struggling.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.480
In this,
we're drowning.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.986
Everybody wanted
Wagner dead.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.157
That is the fifth fruit basket
we've gotten

07:47.200 --> 07:49.998
this week for representing
the man who killed him.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.258
Yes, I just wish
all these supporters

07:51.300 --> 07:53.268
actually thought
he was innocent.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.734
Well, for reasonable doubt,
we just need to give the jury

07:55.770 --> 07:57.658
another suspect,
so let's find somebody.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.007
Hey,

07:59.040 --> 08:00.177
you lost your ballistics
expert, didn't you?

08:00.210 --> 08:03.008
Oh, yeah, turns out Wagner
looted his mutual fund, too.

08:03.050 --> 08:03.846
Why?

08:03.880 --> 08:05.279
I have someone
you should meet.
Oh.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.743
Oh, Alicia, by the way,

08:06.780 --> 08:08.611
I-I'm moving you
onto the Haskin tax case.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.242
Cary, you'll take
witness prep.

08:11.890 --> 08:12.959
Why, did I do
something wrong?

08:12.990 --> 08:14.810
No, no, no, you were great.
We're just moving around

08:14.860 --> 08:15.781
junior associates.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.959
Just send your notes
down to Cary to take over.

08:17.990 --> 08:20.857
Okay, we still need
to pursue the money angle.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.198
Wagner's aide said
he left with $50,000

08:23.230 --> 08:26.097
he had hidden in his office,
so where is it?

08:26.130 --> 08:28.667
Cary, if you could start moving
on that, I'd appreciate it.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.930
TV ANNOUNCER:
You're watching Reality TV.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.677
Reality 24-7.

08:33.710 --> 08:37.771
Next on Reality TV:
his pain is your pain,

08:37.810 --> 08:39.971
his troubles are your troubles.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.683
They call him the Gorilla Boy,
and he'll steal your heart.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.198
(intermittent beeping)

09:08.610 --> 09:10.749
(bottles clattering)

09:10.780 --> 09:12.771
(intermittent beeping continues)

09:14.280 --> 09:16.214
(smoke detector beeps)

09:16.250 --> 09:17.945
(intermittent beeping continues)

09:17.990 --> 09:21.312
Hey, it's me.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.918
Let's get to work.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.780
(intermittent beeping continues)

09:24.830 --> 09:26.058
It sends the wrong message.

09:26.090 --> 09:28.354
What is the right message?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.799
You need an ambassador.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.024
E|i Gold is a thug.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.129
You need someone
who's effective.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.034
E|i Gold is effective.

09:34.070 --> 09:34.991
Gets things done.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.905
Gold, Golden. Who
are we going to hire next--

09:36.940 --> 09:38.237
Goldilocks?

09:38.270 --> 09:39.362
Childs will come after you.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.775
Hire Eli Gold

09:40.810 --> 09:41.902
as your campaign manager,
he'll know

09:41.940 --> 09:42.975
you're planning
to run against him.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.045
Wait.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.173
(beeping stops)

09:47.080 --> 09:48.616
(intermittent beeping resumes)

09:48.650 --> 09:49.617
Hey, Dad,

09:49.650 --> 09:51.242
do you have a minute?

09:51.290 --> 09:54.384
You need some help
with your homework?

09:54.420 --> 09:56.388
No.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.126
_I scanned these
Into my computer

09:58.160 --> 10:00.697
before Grandma threw
the originals away.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.665
They were on our doorstep
in an envelope.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.258
Someone knocked on
our door, then left.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.666
What?
It's faked.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.669
I can tell because
of the light in your eyes.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.132
Please don't tell Mom.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.172
I haven't shown it
to her.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.632
Daniel.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.648
(clears throat)

10:21.920 --> 10:24.388
I want a meeting with E" Gold.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.149
Peter, I think
that's a mistake.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.350
He's a wartime
conSIgIIere.

10:27.390 --> 10:28.789
Now.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.752
Today.

10:36.360 --> 10:40.364
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

10:49.280 --> 10:50.440
ALICIA:
They lived together

10:50.480 --> 10:52.175
for the last three years.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.974
She's pregnant
with Broussard's baby

10:55.020 --> 10:56.009
and therefore should be granted

10:56.050 --> 10:58.211
the same visitation rights
as a married couple.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.287
That's our argument anyway.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.856
So what did
you do wrong?

11:02.890 --> 11:04.152
What did I...?

11:04.190 --> 11:06.329
Why are you being
taken off the case?

11:06.360 --> 11:08.157
Oh.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.294
They want me
on the Haskin tax thing.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.737
Okay.

11:17.140 --> 11:19.108
So, are you going to talk
to her?

11:19.140 --> 11:20.402
VVho?
DIane.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.805
What about?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.398
Why she's favoring Cary
over you.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.940
I don't know that she is.

11:25.980 --> 11:27.277
How long before
this little competition

11:27.320 --> 11:28.469
between Cary and you is over?

11:28.520 --> 11:30.283
A month.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.288
And eight days.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.118
If Diane is showing favoritism,
then you need to deal with that.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.309
And if she's not,

11:36.360 --> 11:38.282
then you need
to deal with that.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.957
Diane is a partner.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.820
I'm a junior associate.
Yeah, whatever.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.828
What?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.189
Alicia, you're a good lawyer,
but you're always waiting

11:45.230 --> 11:47.039
for people
to give you things.
I am not.

11:47.070 --> 11:48.139
Okay.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.808
Then, everything
will work out perfectly.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.202
Talk to Diane.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.376
Tell her she's wrong to
take you off the case

11:58.410 --> 12:00.241
and that Cary is
going to screw it up.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.488
Or... wait for something
good to happen to you.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.427
Does she have a moment?

12:12.460 --> 12:14.928
She's in with the
ballistics expert.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.291
DIANE:
Yeah.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.218
Uh-huh.

12:19.270 --> 12:20.532
Well, it's not
an all-out war,

12:20.570 --> 12:22.197
but, I mean, Will
has his troops,

12:22.240 --> 12:23.264
I have mine.

12:23.310 --> 12:27.337
He tried to fire my tax
litigator, so I had to,

12:27.380 --> 12:28.506
um...

12:28.540 --> 12:29.529
counterattack.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.140
Uh, listen. I'm, uh, in
the office with someone.

12:32.180 --> 12:34.319
Lunch? Good.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.341
Sorry about that, Mr....
McVeigh.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.449
Oh, my goodness.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.048
What an unfortunate name.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.250
Hopefully no relation?

12:40.290 --> 12:41.484
Hopefully.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.220
Um, well,
I see you were the, uh,

12:45.260 --> 12:48.354
ballistics expert in the
Crown Narrows appeal,

12:48.400 --> 12:49.958
but you left halfway through.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.297
Why?

12:51.330 --> 12:52.831
Found out he was guilty.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.965
Is that a deal breaker?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.901
It is. That's why my rates
are so reasonable.

12:58.940 --> 13:02.330
So, if you find,
or you believe you find

13:02.380 --> 13:06.077
that a client is guilty,
you-- what?-- quit?

13:06.110 --> 13:07.179
Yes.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.176
And if you're on the stand?

13:09.220 --> 13:11.381
I will excuse myself.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.158
(chuckling):
Really? My goodness.

13:15.190 --> 13:16.953
You're like something
out of Melville.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.258
(clears throat)

13:22.500 --> 13:25.264
So, why, uh, should I,
uh, hire you,

13:25.300 --> 13:26.858
besides your reasonable rates?

13:26.900 --> 13:29.368
Well, because the
prosecution's case

13:29.400 --> 13:30.936
rests almost exclusively

13:30.970 --> 13:32.835
on tying your client
to the murder weapon,

13:32.880 --> 13:34.575
and I can prove
that it's not his.

13:34.610 --> 13:37.078
Really?
Yes.

13:37.110 --> 13:38.304
Well, your predecessor--

13:38.350 --> 13:40.238
the expert
that you would replace--

13:40.280 --> 13:43.283
intended to show
that the 9mm

13:43.320 --> 13:45.413
was common and the shell
markings negligible.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.213
Is that not your defense?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.318
No, that's not my defense.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.420
Well, uh, what is?

13:51.460 --> 13:54.429
I don't like Chicago.

13:54.460 --> 13:57.099
(both chuckling)

13:57.130 --> 13:58.495
Let me guess.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.896
You like the country.
Yes.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.430
Some cabin somewhere

14:02.470 --> 14:04.563
where you write angry letters
to the editor?

14:08.410 --> 14:10.378
Oh, um, I've offended you?

14:10.410 --> 14:11.604
No. No.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.174
We're clone.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.017
I'll talk to you soon.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.419
(chuckling)

14:22.460 --> 14:24.018
Do you have a moment, Diane?

14:24.060 --> 14:26.381
(chuckling):
Uh, I... I have no idea.

14:26.430 --> 14:30.366
I think I've just been visited
by the Marlboro Man.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.389
VVho?

14:31.430 --> 14:32.465
Oh, our ballistics
expert,

14:32.500 --> 14:35.663
although I-I don't know
if he actually is ours.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.406
Ithink I hired him.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.203
I'm sorry to bother you.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.003
Ijust...

14:41.040 --> 14:42.507
I'm better than Cary.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.206
On the Broussard homicide.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.070
On the eyewitness cross.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.418
I've been working on this case
for three months intensely,

14:50.450 --> 14:51.678
and Cary is just coming on.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.381
I agree.

14:53.420 --> 14:54.682
You...

14:54.720 --> 14:55.948
Well, then, why?

14:55.990 --> 14:57.548
Why... why was I pulled off it?

14:57.590 --> 14:59.080
I don't know.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.449
It wasn't my idea.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.388
Whose?

15:02.430 --> 15:03.897
Will's.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.331
Thank you.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.707
Do you have a moment, Will?

15:15.740 --> 15:17.344
Actually, I don't.
I got a lunch.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.007
How about later this afternoon?

15:23.320 --> 15:25.538
Well, you two do have
a complicated relationship.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.512
You know, an unrequited thing.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.152
What does that even mean?

15:29.190 --> 15:31.055
An unrequited thing?

15:31.090 --> 15:32.455
Look, I don't
really deal well

15:32.490 --> 15:33.457
with all this
high school stuff.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.957
And wouldn't that make
him want me on the case,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.991
not off it?
I don't know.

15:38.030 --> 15:40.169
Alicia, complicated
relationships

15:40.200 --> 15:42.464
are a breeding ground for
misinterpreted action.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.137
Going now.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.159
Bye.

15:48.710 --> 15:50.075
(laughing)

15:50.110 --> 15:51.475
No problem.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.649
I'd like to be helpful
in any way I can.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.375
I won't end up on
your naughty list?

15:55.420 --> 15:57.547
(gallery laughing)

15:57.590 --> 15:59.740
LANDRY:
So, this was at 9:35?

15:59.790 --> 16:02.554
WITNESS:
Yes, uh, when my shift
was over.

16:02.590 --> 16:05.229
I... Iwork
as a Santa Claus

16:05.260 --> 16:06.750
across the street.

16:06.790 --> 16:10.260
And I saw a man
in a black suit

16:10.300 --> 16:13.565
enter the parking garage
at 9:35.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.238
Is the man in court today?

16:15.270 --> 16:16.532
Yes.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.435
That young man there.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.698
Uh, I'm sorry to say.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.605
LANDRY:
Now, Mr. Broussard said he

16:21.640 --> 16:24.143
didn't enter the parking garage
until after the shooting,

16:24.180 --> 16:26.444
but this would have him
entering the garage before.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.243
That's what I saw.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.508
Thank you, Chris.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.381
That is your real name,
isn't it?

16:32.420 --> 16:33.682
(laughing):
Oh, you.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.689
(gallery laughing)

16:36.720 --> 16:38.153
Take out Santa.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.522
Oh, I'd love to.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.425
So, Mr. Suggs,

16:42.460 --> 16:43.461
Chris...

16:44.470 --> 16:46.688
My goodness, that's a
real beard, isn't it?

16:46.730 --> 16:48.163
(chuckles)
Yes, it is.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.497
You want to tug it?

16:49.540 --> 16:51.269
Actually, I would. Yeah.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.561
(laughter)

16:52.610 --> 16:54.237
(grunts playfully)

16:55.310 --> 16:56.629
Okay, so, as you testified,

16:56.680 --> 16:59.274
you work as a Santa
during the holiday season.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.278
What do you do for work
in the off-season?

17:01.320 --> 17:02.514
I get by.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.541
Up at the North Pole?

17:04.590 --> 17:05.443
(laughing)

17:05.490 --> 17:07.549
(chuckles)
No, really. What do you do?

17:07.590 --> 17:10.252
Well, there's commercial work.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.453
And I've _worked
as a movne extra.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.695
Yeah, a porno movie.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.268
Objection:
relevance.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.494
Sustained.
CARY:
So, Chris,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.201
how do you stay warm
out there

17:23.240 --> 17:24.707
on those cold nights
during the holiday season?

17:24.740 --> 17:27.231
I stay warm.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.430
Yeah... but how?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.675
It was 22 degrees
the night of the murder,

17:31.710 --> 17:33.371
with a windchill
factor of five.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.843
The Santa suit is warm.
Because we got
a statement

17:35.880 --> 17:38.587
from the supervisor
on your last job. Your Honor?

17:38.620 --> 17:41.589
And he said he got complaints
about you drinking.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.222
He's a liar.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.228
CARY:
Really?
He's on your naughty list.

17:47.260 --> 17:50.161
So...

17:50.200 --> 17:54.762
you were 55 feet
from the garage--

17:54.800 --> 17:57.132
we measured it--

17:57.170 --> 17:58.728
and you were drinking...

17:58.770 --> 18:00.271
I had one drink.

18:00.310 --> 18:02.130
And you were drinking,

18:02.180 --> 18:07.311
and you still swear
that you saw that man?

18:07.350 --> 18:09.739
I already said what I said.

18:09.780 --> 18:10.849
CARY:
Yes, you did.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.539
Well, thank you, Santa.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.785
And just one last thing:
ho, ho, ho.

18:14.820 --> 18:17.323
Objection. Your Honor!

18:17.360 --> 18:18.850
CARY:
Withdrawn.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.619
(intermittent beeping)

18:23.170 --> 18:25.161
(intermittent beeping continues)

18:32.270 --> 18:34.170
So, this is the kitchen cabinet.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.177
Yep.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.529
And this...
this must be

18:36.580 --> 18:38.468
the faked photo.
Do you have the original?

18:38.510 --> 18:39.602
Nope.

18:39.650 --> 18:40.446
The envelope it came in?

18:40.480 --> 18:41.811
Thrown away.
Thrown away or destroyed?

18:41.850 --> 18:44.648
Thrown away.
Well, that was clumsy.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.839
(intermittent beeping continues)

18:45.890 --> 18:47.687
Yeah.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.153
So, Eli, look.

18:49.190 --> 18:50.282
Considering your
reputation,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.150
I think we're going
to have to talk

18:52.190 --> 18:53.589
about a few
ground rules.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.598
And what have you heard
about my reputation?

18:55.630 --> 18:56.756
That you speak
your mind,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.598
your mind tends
toward expletives,

18:59.630 --> 19:01.666
you are a classically
trained pianist,

19:01.700 --> 19:03.634
and you require Saturdays off.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.706
Who told you about Saturdays,
shiksa Bambi over there?

19:05.740 --> 19:08.607
PETER:
I've also been told
that in a street fight,

19:08.640 --> 19:10.449
you're the man.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.643
(intermittent beeping continues)

19:13.680 --> 19:15.568
You want me _
to watch my swearing?

19:15.620 --> 19:18.748
Listen, considering
my circumstances,

19:18.790 --> 19:19.814
my home will
remain our base,

19:19.850 --> 19:21.613
and my wife and children
live here.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.651
(beeping continues)

19:25.730 --> 19:26.526
(beeping stops)

19:26.560 --> 19:27.925
You need to replace
the strainer.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.927
(closes dishwasher)

19:28.960 --> 19:30.518
Okay, first of all...

19:30.570 --> 19:32.458
Peter?
Yes.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.730
The only reason I'm here
is because what I've heard

19:34.770 --> 19:36.328
about your reputation.
Which is?

19:36.370 --> 19:37.439
You're a son...

19:37.470 --> 19:40.598
Can I say "son of a bitch,"
or is that too salty?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.904
That's fine.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.840
You, sir, are a son of a bitch,

19:44.880 --> 19:48.441
but a son of a bitch who likes
to change things for the better.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.617
I've also heard
that you're toxic,

19:49.650 --> 19:51.345
and if I join
your merry little band

19:51.390 --> 19:52.618
of political hobbyists here,

19:52.650 --> 19:54.652
I'm going to end up
regretting it.

19:55.690 --> 19:57.726
That sounds about right.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.798
Okay, here's my first
piece of advice.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.320
Fire Bambi.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.429
Hey.
And hire your son.

20:05.470 --> 20:06.528
This is the best piece

20:06.570 --> 20:09.368
of oppo research
this campaign has done.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.708
Yes, but we're still trying
to figure out who it is.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.332
Oh, I know who it is.
VVho?

20:12.370 --> 20:13.837
It's a Federal
Investigator

20:13.880 --> 20:15.871
doing scout work
for a possible indictment.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.715
How do you know that?

20:23.750 --> 20:24.444
You can't know that.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.685
Oh, I know a lot
of things, lady.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.857
The question is:
why don't you know it?

20:27.890 --> 20:30.324
Look, you're under
Federal investigation.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.487
What you need to find out
is why.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.768
LANDRY:
Mr. Knox, what was
your relationship

20:42.800 --> 20:44.529
with the victim?
WOMAN:
Go to hell!

20:44.570 --> 20:46.333
Ma'am._
He stole my retirement!

20:46.370 --> 20:48.270
He stole everything!

20:48.310 --> 20:50.847
Free Brad Broussard!
Free Brad Broussard!

20:50.880 --> 20:52.905
JUDGE:
Order.
(gavel banging)

20:52.950 --> 20:56.579
Order. I will clear
this entire courtroom

20:56.620 --> 20:58.542
if there is one more outburst.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.841
My apologies, Mr. Knox.

20:59.890 --> 21:01.448
Mr. Wagner and I

21:01.490 --> 21:03.788
built our investment firm
up from nothing.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.751
Sadly, I was the one

21:04.790 --> 21:06.678
who suggested he hire Brad

21:06.730 --> 21:08.493
as a bodyguard
and driver.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.418
Now, the accused
phoned you on the night

21:10.470 --> 21:11.823
of the murder,
didn't he?
Objection, Your Honor.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.395
This wasn't in Mr. Knox's
statement to the police.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.998
Yes, Your Honor,
Mr. Knox

21:16.040 --> 21:17.530
has since deepened
his memory

21:17.570 --> 21:18.764
of the events
of that night.

21:18.810 --> 21:19.765
Oh, come on.
"Deepened"?

21:19.810 --> 21:21.607
I'll allow.
KNOX:
Yes.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.777
Brad did phone me.

21:22.810 --> 21:23.799
He was very upset.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.078
He wanted
to get married,

21:25.110 --> 21:28.318
and he needed his life savings
to buy a house.

21:28.350 --> 21:31.683
And what did
you tell him?
Well, I tried
to calm him down.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.984
He was talking
about confronting Mr. Wagner.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.851
I tried to explain
that we

21:35.890 --> 21:37.426
were both tricked by Madoff,

21:37.460 --> 21:39.348
but he wouldn't listen,
and he hung up.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.449
Oh. Thank you, Mr. Knox.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.821
Ten-minute recess.
(gavelbangs)

21:43.870 --> 21:46.919
I think we've narrowed
your suspects down to one.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.778
I just wanted
to know...

21:56.580 --> 21:57.877
Just wanted to know what?

22:02.520 --> 22:04.886
I'll... I'll get these out
to you in a second.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.882
What's wrong?

22:12.930 --> 22:15.398
I checked with Diane.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.398
Why I'm no longer on the
Broussard homicide.

22:17.430 --> 22:18.863
She said it was
your deCISIon.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.936
Yes.

22:20.970 --> 22:23.131
I just wanted to make sure I
hadn't done anything wrong.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.001
No, no, no, no.
Of course not.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.928
Then I don't get it.

22:29.980 --> 22:32.505
Maybe it was a mistake.

22:32.550 --> 22:34.472
I... I've been feeling guilty

22:34.520 --> 22:37.489
lately about pulling you away

22:37.520 --> 22:40.512
on the Rucker defense
and the Memorial North suit.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.651
I just thought that...

22:45.860 --> 22:49.159
I just thought with Peter
coming home...

22:49.200 --> 22:50.827
your life's
complicated enough.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.498
I should give you a break.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.996
But I don't want a break.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.031
I want to be here. I want
to be doing a good job.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.708
You are doing a good job.

22:58.740 --> 23:00.879
Then use me.

23:00.910 --> 23:02.377
(knocking on door)

23:03.950 --> 23:06.805
Peter can take
care of himself.

23:06.850 --> 23:08.511
He's irrelevant to this.

23:08.550 --> 23:09.869
I want to be here.

23:10.950 --> 23:12.941
I want you to be here.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.723
Then...

23:21.160 --> 23:23.151
Then I'm here.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.631
Okay.

23:45.220 --> 23:46.710
Knox has an alibi.

23:46.750 --> 23:47.956
He and his wife
were gomg

23:47.990 --> 23:49.651
to a Christmas party
later that night,

23:49.690 --> 23:51.920
and were dressing at home
at the time of the murder.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.598
His alibi is
his wife?
Yeah.

23:53.630 --> 23:55.052
Housekeeper was off
for the night,

23:55.100 --> 23:56.692
and the daughter
was out at a party.

23:56.730 --> 23:58.129
Well, then let's get
to the wife. What else?

23:58.170 --> 24:00.126
Well, logically,

24:00.170 --> 24:01.660
there is a motive.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.669
I looked into the Knox
and Wagner partnership.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.166
They were facing
indictment,

24:06.210 --> 24:07.632
and both their bank accounts
were frozen.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.773
Now, although they swore

24:09.810 --> 24:11.471
that they would fight
the charges together,

24:11.510 --> 24:13.546
the Feds were trying to turn one
against the other.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.047
I like it.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.240
Knox kills Wagner to keep
him from testifying.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.612
Can we get anything certain
from the Feds?

24:18.650 --> 24:20.515
I can try.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.516
(indistinct conversations)

24:24.530 --> 24:26.521
(phone ringing)

24:28.900 --> 24:30.891
We need your help.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.231
(knocking on door)

24:40.270 --> 24:42.807
Get your name out fast.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.876
Mrs. Knox,

24:44.910 --> 24:46.047
I'm Alicia Florrick.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.547
Not interested.

24:47.580 --> 24:50.549
Not fast enough.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.546
Mrs. Knox, I'm Alicia Florrick.

24:52.590 --> 24:55.559
I just have a few questions.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.729
Maybe try another name.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.928
(Irish accent):
Trapped here, living
in this limbo.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.926
The first week it
was the reporters.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.768
Then they disappeared,
then it was the haters.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.109
All the people who
lost their money.

25:12.140 --> 25:15.109
I wanted to yell,
"He disgusts me, too."

25:15.140 --> 25:17.608
Then why are you
supporting his alibi?

25:17.650 --> 25:19.709
Well, that's a question
I've asked myself.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.069
Were you here together
all night?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.645
I was here.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.317
He went out?

25:26.350 --> 25:29.080
I will remain discreetly silent.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.281
That's from Chicago Children

25:31.330 --> 25:32.854
Fighting Cancer,
isn't it?

25:32.890 --> 25:34.619
Yes, a donation gift.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.548
My husband and I attended that

25:36.600 --> 25:37.760
fund-raiser last year.
It's a good cause.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.290
Terrible Swedish meatballs.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.298
(chuckles)

25:41.340 --> 25:43.296
I'm sorry, Mrs. Florrick,

25:43.340 --> 25:46.309
but if you're looking for a
hero, I'm afraid I'm not it.

25:46.340 --> 25:47.705
We're looking
for the truth.

25:47.740 --> 25:49.571
Oh, yes, well, aren't we all?

25:49.610 --> 25:51.749
Rachel, if we happen
to get you on the stand,

25:51.780 --> 25:53.645
would we be happy
with the results?

25:55.680 --> 25:58.080
Let me put it this way.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.111
Yes.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.254
But we both know

26:02.290 --> 26:03.882
you won't be getting me
on the stand,

26:03.930 --> 26:05.886
because my husband
won't allow it.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.921
DIANE:
She's right.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.928
_ We've run smack
Into spousal prIVIIege.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.928
Knox can prevent her
from testifying.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.597
But spousal privilege
is supposed

26:13.640 --> 26:15.631
to foster open communication
in a marriage,

26:15.670 --> 26:17.092
and there's no
marriage here.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.300
They sleep in
separate rooms.

26:18.340 --> 26:19.261
She hates him.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.608
His scandal has turned
her life into hell.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.245
Nope. Tried it
in another case.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.271
Courts respect marriage
too much.

26:26.310 --> 26:27.504
Even bad ones.

26:27.550 --> 26:29.939
And the state is keeping Judith
from visiting Brad in lockup

26:29.980 --> 26:31.743
because they're
not married.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.143
Marriage: an institution
fraught with ironies.

26:33.190 --> 26:36.114
There is an exception
to spousal privilege.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.151
A third person present.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.919
I doubt if Knox is stupid
enough to tell his wife

26:39.960 --> 26:41.359
to lie_ in front
of a thIrd person.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.594
Their daughter.

26:43.430 --> 26:45.398
Worth a try. Check that out.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.637
WILL:
Rachel Knox is Irish.

26:47.670 --> 26:48.659
You could try to argue

26:48.700 --> 26:50.167
their marriage was
a green card fraud on the state.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.259
Okay, we have a new mission now.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.937
We need to break
spousal privilege

26:53.980 --> 26:55.379
so we can get Rachel Knox
on the stand

26:55.410 --> 26:56.377
to testify against her husband.

26:56.410 --> 26:59.948
We do that, Brad Broussard
has a fighting chance.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.353
I don't think you're right,
but we have someone looking

27:10.390 --> 27:12.381
into a possible Federal
investigation.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.356
Just so we're clear.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.369
If we're going to fight,
you're going to lose.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.392
Peter trusts me.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.067
Golden may want
you here,

27:24.110 --> 27:25.737
but Peter is the
ultimate decider.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.362
He's the one who's...

27:27.410 --> 27:28.775
What are you doing?

27:28.810 --> 27:31.802
Lowering my pants
so you can kiss my ass.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.383
(car horns honking)

27:47.430 --> 27:49.398
I have two questions for you.
Two?

27:49.430 --> 27:51.398
Really?
They're multiplying.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.421
The Broussard homicide.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.267
Did you offer to make
Wagner a deal?

27:55.300 --> 27:56.938
No idea.
Not one of mine.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.267
But you can find
out, right?

27:58.310 --> 27:59.459
I can do a lot of things.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.728
I'm just not feeling
motivated.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.099
The second?

28:03.140 --> 28:05.142
Peter Florrick.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.375
You know what, guys?

28:07.410 --> 28:09.344
I will be right upstairs
in just a minute.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.348
No.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.779
No, you're not getting
anything from me on that.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.811
Sounds serious.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.283
No, sounds like a "no comment."

28:18.330 --> 28:20.025
It's just that...

28:20.060 --> 28:22.722
Actually, you're right.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.297
I'm not going to get anything
from you, am I?

28:26.330 --> 28:28.139
Okay, what is it?

28:28.170 --> 28:30.138
No, it's Florrick--
he's not one of yours.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.728
You won't be interested.

28:33.780 --> 28:35.771
Okay.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.009
Where did you get that?

28:41.050 --> 28:42.119
You know him?

28:42.150 --> 28:44.482
Where did you get that?

28:46.520 --> 28:48.715
I'll handle this.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.225
Hey.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.327
Okay.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.520
All right, tonight?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.460
9:00. We'll talk.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.320
Okay.

29:06.540 --> 29:08.337
McVEIGH:
Yeah.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.804
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.841
Yeah.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.512
Mm-hmm.

29:18.550 --> 29:21.781
Hey, uh...
so I got a client here.

29:23.390 --> 29:25.358
Yeah. Yeah,
lunch sounds good.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.358
Okay.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.029
Is that Photoshopped?

29:30.060 --> 29:31.459
You and the Barracuda?
No.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.422
No, she was at a pro-life rally.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.165
Oh, of course.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.360
And you always

29:36.400 --> 29:38.368
keep her picture
just right there?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.401
No. No, that was for you.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.037
I got it framed, too.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.342
(chuckles)

29:44.380 --> 29:45.938
I'm honored.

29:45.980 --> 29:47.379
So, what do you have to show me?

29:47.410 --> 29:51.187
You... you remind me
a little of her.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.812
Oh, good.

29:52.850 --> 29:53.851
(laughs)

29:53.890 --> 29:55.289
Which part: quitting
the governorship

29:55.320 --> 29:57.151
or the moose hunting?

29:57.190 --> 29:59.329
Standing up for your values.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.499
Okay.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.395
Nothing good will come
out of this conversation.

30:04.430 --> 30:06.489
So, what do you have?

30:11.370 --> 30:12.564
Um...

30:12.610 --> 30:14.578
am I to follow?

30:26.550 --> 30:27.949
(beeping)

30:45.240 --> 30:46.264
They're not mine.

30:46.310 --> 30:48.278
Ongoing cases.

30:48.310 --> 30:51.609
This is a gun identical
to your clients.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.072
Beretta 92FS.

30:53.110 --> 30:55.249
I seem to spend my life
around guns these days.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.248
And this is his ammunition.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.545
9mm 115 grain, FMJ.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.319
FMJ?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.351
Full metal jacket.
Oh, like the movie.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.967
Loud.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.297
No barriers to the sound.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.296
Just like the garage.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.137
There was a janitor
two levels up.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.603
He heard nothing.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.608
Visible gunpowder burns.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.608
Stippling...

31:24.650 --> 31:26.606
here, here around the wound,

31:26.650 --> 31:28.641
in a circle.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.616
The victim.

31:31.650 --> 31:34.153
Half circle of stippling.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.055
Police say his coat collar
caused the half circle.

31:36.090 --> 31:37.409
What, you disagree?

31:37.460 --> 31:40.054
A line here.

31:42.430 --> 31:43.522
Meaning?

31:51.610 --> 31:54.204
Stippling-- a half moon.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.208
The victim was
In a car.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.502
Passenger seat.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.404
Killer was driving.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.317
He got out, came around,
fired point-blank.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.375
Sound was absorbed partly
into the automobile.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.388
That's why the janitor
didn't hear anything.

32:05.420 --> 32:06.409
Then he fired twice more.

32:06.450 --> 32:07.485
You might want
to cover up again.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.511
(two gunshots)

32:11.530 --> 32:13.486
Killer opened the door,
pulled him out,

32:13.530 --> 32:16.522
tossed him on the floor,
then he took off in the car.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.268
You're not going
to get reception in here.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.996
And I already checked.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.200
Checked what?

32:24.240 --> 32:25.969
There was no evidence

32:26.010 --> 32:27.466
of a shooting
in Mr. Broussard's car.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.070
But you are confident,
Mr. McVeigh,

32:30.110 --> 32:31.475
that the shooting

32:31.510 --> 32:33.307
happened in a car.

32:33.350 --> 32:37.013
My conﬁdence isn't
as important as the science.

32:37.050 --> 32:38.984
Clearly, there is an imprint

32:39.020 --> 32:41.318
of a seat belt shoulder
strap on the Victim.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.612
So I sought out information
on the vehicles

32:43.660 --> 32:46.481
of the other principals
mmsmm.

32:46.530 --> 32:50.751
What did you discover about
the car belonging to Mr. Knox,

32:50.800 --> 32:52.688
the victim's business
partner?
Objection.

32:52.730 --> 32:54.698
I'm not sure why you're
objecting, Counselor.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.492
I haven't heard anything yet.
Overruled.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.758
I tried to investigate
Mr. Knox's automobiles

32:58.810 --> 33:01.301
to discover if there
were Signs of a shooting.

33:01.340 --> 33:04.241
The police report says
three cars were clean.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.271
But he had four cars registered.

33:07.510 --> 33:10.115
What happened to his fourth car?

33:10.150 --> 33:12.539
Mr. Knox claimed
that it was stolen,

33:12.590 --> 33:14.285
day after the murder.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.457
It was never recovered.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.720
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.

33:18.760 --> 33:21.297
No problem.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.717
(sighs)

33:50.290 --> 33:51.621
(taps finger)

33:52.630 --> 33:54.621
WILL:
Who's it from?

33:56.100 --> 33:57.499
Oh, no one.
I mean, I don't know.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.088
Probably a
secret admirer.

33:59.130 --> 34:01.598
Well, yeah.
I mean, I have a lot of those.

34:02.740 --> 34:05.300
Nice work on
Broussard today.

34:05.340 --> 34:06.659
Thanks.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.536
Look, I know we're going through
a lot of turmoil here

34:10.580 --> 34:12.241
over the direction of the firm,

34:12.280 --> 34:14.077
with Stern gone
and all, but

34:14.120 --> 34:16.418
wherever we end up...

34:16.450 --> 34:18.509
I respect you, Diane.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.615
Didn't they say that
to Secretariat

34:21.660 --> 34:23.184
before they put him down?

34:23.220 --> 34:24.585
I don't think they said "Diane."

34:42.580 --> 34:44.571
(laughs)

34:47.850 --> 34:49.841
(laughing)

34:53.590 --> 34:56.559
(gentle melody plays,
people conversting indistinctly)

34:56.590 --> 34:58.558
KALINDA:
It's so cold out here.

34:58.590 --> 34:59.818
I like the cold.

34:59.860 --> 35:02.499
Part of the program training is,
they drop you in freezing water,

35:02.530 --> 35:03.724
and you tread water
for 20 minutes.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.762
Yeah, but this
is dinner.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.534
I have something
I want you to consider.

35:12.570 --> 35:13.764
Going inside?

35:13.810 --> 35:15.175
Uh-uh.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.336
Join us.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.769
Join you?

35:18.810 --> 35:21.142
And you are?

35:21.180 --> 35:23.148
The FBI.

35:23.180 --> 35:25.239
You'd be a good investigator.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.689
You're being serious?

35:26.720 --> 35:27.846
Yeah.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.858
Why?

35:30.890 --> 35:32.824
I like you.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.293
You're good.

35:34.330 --> 35:35.649
President Obama

35:35.700 --> 35:37.759
got us more money,
and the hiring freeze is over.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.394
Yeah, I've
already got a job.

35:42.370 --> 35:44.338
This one's better.

35:44.370 --> 35:46.133
(quietly):
Defense of your country.

35:48.610 --> 35:50.635
Who's the man in the photo?

35:50.680 --> 35:52.170
Oh. What photo?

35:52.210 --> 35:53.802
The photo I showed you earlier.

35:53.850 --> 35:56.739
What's going on with the
Florrick investigation?

35:56.780 --> 35:58.384
Listen,

35:58.420 --> 36:01.287
I want you to work under me.

36:07.390 --> 36:11.269
And feed me random things
that you come by.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.927
Things about Florrick?

36:12.970 --> 36:14.335
Yes, that.

36:14.370 --> 36:15.792
Other things.

36:20.810 --> 36:21.777
No.

36:22.810 --> 36:24.971
Thank you, but

36:25.010 --> 36:27.979
I'm... I'm happy where I am.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.217
And where is that?

36:37.860 --> 36:39.487
They found Broussard's gun.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.555
What?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.749
The murder weapon.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.360
It was anonymously sent
to the Chicago PD.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.662
And?

36:46.700 --> 36:48.668
Bad news.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.429
It's your client's.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.341
Broussard thinks
his gun was stolen.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.699
He says Knox knew
where he kept it,

36:59.750 --> 37:00.739
in the glove compartment.

37:00.780 --> 37:01.872
It is pretty
suspicious--

37:01.920 --> 37:04.309
showing up anonymously right
after our best day in court.

37:04.350 --> 37:05.783
Any hope on breaking
spousal privilege?

37:05.820 --> 37:06.684
Nothing on the
green card.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.381
We're still looking
for the daughter,

37:08.420 --> 37:09.819
but she's out
of the country.

37:09.860 --> 37:11.487
Okay, meet upstairs
in half an hour.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.418
It's gonna be a late night.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.460
ALICIA:
Excuse me?

37:21.600 --> 37:23.397
Just resting my eyes.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.668
Yo
ul
re.. ?

37:24.710 --> 37:26.905
Eli Gold.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.828
My husband hired you.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.440
You're taller
than I expected.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.640
Thank you.

37:33.680 --> 37:34.817
I thought, as we're going

37:34.850 --> 37:38.809
to be in each other's lives,
I should introduce myself.

37:38.850 --> 37:41.614
Oh, that's really
not necessary.

37:41.660 --> 37:45.881
So, you're the force
behind the force, huh?

37:45.930 --> 37:47.682
No. I'm nobody, Mr. Gold.

37:47.730 --> 37:49.755
I'm just working. Working here.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.755
You don't want him to run?

37:50.800 --> 37:51.892
What did I say

37:51.930 --> 37:53.659
that would suggest that to you?

37:53.700 --> 37:54.894
Just your manner.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.932
And what does my manner suggest
to you now?

37:57.970 --> 37:59.301
(laughs)
Quick question.

37:59.340 --> 38:00.705
What do you think of Kya?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.702
No.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.741
What?

38:04.780 --> 38:06.873
Your political squabbles
are your own, not mine.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.946
Don't try to manipulate me.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.384
You're right.
My apologies.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.944
You know, um,

38:13.990 --> 38:16.083
you and I

38:16.120 --> 38:18.554
are going to be the best
of friends, Mrs. Florrick.

38:18.590 --> 38:20.558
And do you
know why?
I have no idea.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.727
Because you're
cautious,

38:21.760 --> 38:23.751
and so am I.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.791
Your husband isn't.

38:25.830 --> 38:27.923
Nice meeting you.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.637
Although I find the late arrival

38:33.670 --> 38:35.103
of this gun suspicious,

38:35.140 --> 38:37.802
I would be remiss if I didn't
allow it into evidence.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.649
Mr. Landry, please make it
available to the defense.

38:42.980 --> 38:46.416
I think we have to start talking
about a deal.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.486
But the ballistic evidence.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.488
We've knocked holes
in their case,

38:50.520 --> 38:52.750
but I don't know
if the holes are big enough.

38:52.790 --> 38:53.950
JUDITH:
How many years?

38:56.730 --> 38:57.799
Second degree murder,

38:57.830 --> 38:58.967
ten years.

38:59.000 --> 38:59.989
With time off for
good behavior,

39:00.030 --> 39:01.668
it would be four and a half.

39:01.700 --> 39:02.928
And if we wait
for a jury?

39:02.970 --> 39:04.835
If convicted?

39:04.870 --> 39:06.701
Minimum sentence
of 45 years.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.401
No parole,

39:08.440 --> 39:09.998
no time off.

39:16.550 --> 39:18.882
He'd be four years old.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.683
You didn't do it.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.785
See him grow up...

39:23.820 --> 39:26.084
it would be worth it.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.624
I think we've been
going about this all wrong.

39:32.670 --> 39:33.898
What?

39:33.930 --> 39:35.534
The $50,000 missing
from Wagner.

39:35.570 --> 39:36.867
What happened
to it?
Exactly.

39:36.900 --> 39:38.902
Knox's bank account
was frozen,

39:38.940 --> 39:40.567
he still has
that 50 grand.

39:40.610 --> 39:41.872
Unless he buried it
somewhere.

39:41.910 --> 39:44.401
I think we found our way
around spousal privilege.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.975
We can get Rachel Knox
to testify on the stand.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.079
How?

39:48.110 --> 39:49.919
LANDRY:
Rachel Knox can't testify.

39:49.950 --> 39:51.588
Spousal privilege is

39:51.620 --> 39:52.917
very clear.

39:52.950 --> 39:54.884
Yes, it is, Your Honor,
which is why she can testify.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.912
Spousal privilege is pierced
when there is a conspiracy

39:57.960 --> 39:59.154
between spouses.

39:59.190 --> 40:00.657
What conspiracy?

40:00.690 --> 40:02.021
We subpoenaed the records

40:02.060 --> 40:03.755
of Chicago Children
Fighting Cancer.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.997
Mrs. Knox had recently
been given a Spire Award

40:07.030 --> 40:08.895
for making
a large donation,

40:08.940 --> 40:10.464
$50,000 to be exact.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.559
An amount that
cannot be explained

40:12.610 --> 40:14.976
through normal
financial channels.

40:15.010 --> 40:16.932
You're accusing Mrs. Knox
of murdering Miles Wagner?

40:16.980 --> 40:19.869
No. Rachel Knox helped her
husband dispose of the money

40:19.910 --> 40:21.207
acquired from the victim.

40:21.250 --> 40:24.117
This makes her an agent
of her husband's crime,

40:24.150 --> 40:26.641
which breaks spousal privilege.

40:27.690 --> 40:29.851
RACHEL:
You want to know

40:29.890 --> 40:31.482
what happened on the night
of the murder?

40:31.530 --> 40:32.656
DIANA:
Yes,

40:32.690 --> 40:35.158
between the hours
of 9:00 and 10:00.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.730
My husband left.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.988
And when did he return?

40:45.870 --> 40:47.838
An hour later.

40:47.870 --> 40:50.976
And what did he have

40:51.010 --> 40:53.069
in his possession?

40:53.110 --> 40:54.668
A suitcase...

40:55.950 --> 40:57.975
...fi||ed with cash.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.554
Thank you.

41:40.260 --> 41:42.251
(laughs)

41:44.060 --> 41:46.062
(sighs)

41:52.140 --> 41:54.870
(chuckles)

41:55.910 --> 41:58.572
PETER:
Ow! Oh.
(Grace laughs)

41:58.610 --> 42:00.646
All right, here,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:00.680 --> 42:03.148
You're not going
to strike me out. Go.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.114
PETER:
Aah!
(Grace laughs)

42:05.150 --> 42:06.811
Right there to first base.
Hey, babe.

42:06.850 --> 42:08.147
How was work?

42:08.190 --> 42:10.055
That good, huh?

42:10.090 --> 42:12.058
No, it's just role reversal.

42:12.090 --> 42:14.058
How about
some pizza?

42:14.090 --> 42:15.227
We sent out.

42:15.260 --> 42:16.591
Yeah. No.

42:16.630 --> 42:18.052
I think I just
want some wine.
Okay.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.226
I'll pour.

42:19.270 --> 42:21.067
I want to talk _
to you about something.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.330
ALICIA:
What?
Just something.

42:23.370 --> 42:25.031
(quietly):
Don't worry.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.570
ALICIA:
How could they hide this
from me?

42:29.610 --> 42:30.736
Well,

42:30.780 --> 42:32.179
I think they
kept it from you

42:32.210 --> 42:33.541
because they wanted
to protect you.

42:37.380 --> 42:38.745
I know.

42:38.790 --> 42:39.916
I talked to Zach.

42:39.950 --> 42:41.019
He knows he was wrong.

42:41.050 --> 42:42.312
It...

42:42.360 --> 42:44.783
Yeah, but their hearts
were in the right place.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.024
(sighs)

42:46.060 --> 42:48.221
I can't even absorb this.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.251
I know.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.299
Oh, now, wait, wait.

42:54.330 --> 42:56.093
Don't talk to them now.

42:56.140 --> 42:58.768
I told them we'd talk
to them tomorrow, okay?

42:58.810 --> 43:00.163
I don't know anymore.

43:00.210 --> 43:02.303
I don't know...

43:02.340 --> 43:04.103
You had a long day.
(sighs)

43:04.140 --> 43:06.279
Here.

43:06.310 --> 43:08.175
We're gonna work
this out tomorrow.

43:08.210 --> 43:09.575
I don't know if we will.

43:11.950 --> 43:14.089
We will.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.280
PETER:
Hey.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.787
ZACH:
Hey.

43:16.820 --> 43:18.014
PETER:
Okay, are you ready?

43:18.060 --> 43:19.152
ZACH:
Bring it on, Dad.

43:19.190 --> 43:21.021
Go ahead, back up.

43:21.060 --> 43:21.958
Back up, Zach,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.628
because this one's
gomg over the fence.

43:24.670 --> 43:27.719
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

43:27.770 --> 43:29.032
PETER:
Are you challenging me?

43:29.070 --> 43:32.039
