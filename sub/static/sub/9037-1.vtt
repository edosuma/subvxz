00:05.438 --> 00:07.639
- Oh, look who's here.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.108
Guys, I got to go, okay?
I'm late.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.175
- Okay.
- I'll see you guys.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.477
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.379
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.214
I'm late.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.216
- Yeah, ray, listen, ally drew
this picture of our family,

00:17.218 --> 00:18.784
And now she wants to put it
up on the fridge.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.285
- Yeah, so?

00:20.287 --> 00:21.286
- Well, look at it.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.454
There's ally and the twins,

00:22.456 --> 00:23.455
And there's you and me,

00:23.457 --> 00:26.091
And, look at your parents.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.359
- Oh, she made them giants.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.162
- Yeah.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.730
- With sharp teeth and claws.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.535
- Yeah, and they're
attacking our house.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.070
- Stop it,
I'm showing him.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.571
- No, this way.
It goes this way.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.807
- She's very perceptive.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.108
- We can't put this
on the fridge.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.610
Your parents
are going to see it.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.545
- Do you like
my picture, daddy?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.180
- Um, yes, I do.
I do, sweetie.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.748
- Honey, how come you made
grandma and grandpa

00:49.750 --> 00:51.216
Look so scary?

00:51.218 --> 00:52.551
- That's not
grandma and grandpa.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.254
Those are
Halloween monsters.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.623
- Oh.
- Okay.

00:57.625 --> 01:01.460
- Grandma and grandpa
aren't monsters.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.699
- Ah, youth.
- Yup.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.505
- Hi, I'm ray, and I live here
in long island

01:13.507 --> 01:16.775
With my wife debra,

01:16.777 --> 01:19.645
My six-year-old daughter,
and twin two-year-old boys.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.646
All: Whee!

01:20.648 --> 01:23.582
My parents...

01:23.584 --> 01:25.484
Live across the street.

01:25.486 --> 01:35.594
That's right.

01:35.596 --> 01:45.704
That's right.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.606
- They're gonna call it, man.
There's no way.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.141
There's no way
they're gonna get it in.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.310
- So none of these
are real massages?

01:53.480 --> 01:55.280
- Well, andy,
why would a real masseuse

01:55.282 --> 01:57.116
Have a black bar
across her eyes?

01:59.719 --> 02:01.620
- You know why?
The black matches her whip.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.759
- So all of this is sex?

02:07.761 --> 02:09.862
- Yes, it's sex.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.763
- Then these prices
are very reasonable.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.734
[phone rings]

02:15.736 --> 02:17.503
- Press box.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.171
Yeah, hold on one second.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.206
Kevin, it's roy firestone.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.207
- Ooh. Roy's calling.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.842
- "ooh. Roy's calling.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.145
"I'm on tv with roy.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.746
Mmm, roy firestone."

02:27.748 --> 02:29.515
- You're not a little jealous,
are you, andy?

02:29.517 --> 02:30.816
- No, I'm not jealous.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.285
So kevin does the play-by-play
for the mets,

02:33.287 --> 02:36.488
And I'm just
his humpbacked stat guy.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.656
Well, you know what?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.458
Without me, he wouldn't
know what to say.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.728
He'd open up his mouth,
and meat would fall out.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.829
- Thanks.
Yep, I'll tell him now.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.364
All right, roy.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.332
Yeah!
You know who that was?

02:47.334 --> 02:50.235
That was
roy freaking firestone.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.938
- Did he ask you
to a sleepover?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.740
- You, my friend,
are gonna be on tv.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.575
- Me?
What are you talking about?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.243
- Harvey johnson's
taking a vacation,

02:58.245 --> 02:59.511
And roy wants you
to fill in with us

02:59.513 --> 03:01.580
On sportscall
with roy firestone.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.714
- Get out of here.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.715
Come on, I don't--

03:03.717 --> 03:04.783
I don't know tv.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.251
I'm a sportswriter.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.654
- Roy specifically asked
for a newspaper guy

03:08.656 --> 03:11.823
Or a chinese person.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.258
- Wait a minute.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.626
Wait, wait, wait,
that's a live tv show.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.861
- It's 30 minutes.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.696
Come on, it's the easiest money
you ever made.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.431
- Easier than
the 40 bucks he got

03:19.433 --> 03:23.235
When you couldn't do
seven push-ups?

03:23.237 --> 03:24.236
- It was ten, andy.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.638
I couldn't do ten push-ups.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.574
- It doesn't matter
because you stopped after two.

03:31.477 --> 03:32.611
- So you're in, right?

03:32.613 --> 03:33.946
- I don't know.
I got to--

03:33.948 --> 03:35.347
Come on, I got to
think it over.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.615
- I got to let them know
tonight, ray.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.783
- Roy wants me?

03:37.785 --> 03:39.351
Come on, he knows who I am.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.519
- Everybody knows who you are.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.887
You know sports, you --

03:41.889 --> 03:44.289
You get to the heart,
the poetry, that is sports.

03:44.291 --> 03:48.427
- Oh, I'm having the stomach
that is nauseous.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.962
- You're sure he knows me.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.230
- Yes!
- He's read my stuff?

03:51.232 --> 03:52.764
- He knows it all.
Come on!

03:52.766 --> 03:54.600
- But you think I'll do
all right on there?

03:54.602 --> 03:55.867
- You're gonna do great,
man, come on.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.868
- All right, I'll do it.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.403
- Yeah, that's the man I know.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.371
- Oh, man,
I got to call debra.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.872
- Yeah, look at you.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.507
- Debra's gonna flip, man,
when she hears this.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.876
- Whoo!
Tv big shot.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.478
- Hi.
Oh, hi, michael.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.579
Michael answered the phone.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.248
His first time.
He's never done that.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.249
- Huh, first time.

04:10.251 --> 04:13.318
What is he, 14 now, ray?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.453
- He's two.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.388
Yeah, hi, it's daddy.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.856
No, I know daddy's not home.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.857
I'm daddy.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.559
No, I'm daddy!

04:20.561 --> 04:22.327
Yeah, I--
is mommy--

04:22.329 --> 04:23.328
Hello?

04:23.330 --> 04:25.364
No, don't go get daddy!

04:25.366 --> 04:27.466
He dropped the phone.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.734
Is somebody there?

04:28.736 --> 04:29.968
Somebody there
to pick up the phone?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.370
Debra.
I hear you, debra.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.704
You're walking
right by the phone now.

04:32.706 --> 04:33.705
Look down.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.674
Look down, debra!

04:35.676 --> 04:36.675
I'm in the phone!

04:41.314 --> 04:44.683
You know what my mother did?

04:44.685 --> 04:48.654
She sent flyers out
all over the neighborhood.

04:48.656 --> 04:52.324
My father told everybody
at the elks.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.425
Give me--
give me some tips, man.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.626
Tell me something.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.927
- Just make love
to the camera, ray.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.765
Hey, what do you say, fellas?

04:59.767 --> 05:00.932
- Hey, roy.
- Good to see you.

05:00.934 --> 05:01.932
You all know james worthy.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.502
- Hey, james,
good to see you again.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.936
- Ray, good
to see you again.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.705
- You all ready
for the big show?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.073
- I guess so.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.808
I don't do tv much.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.511
Ever.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.579
First time.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.648
Kind of got
some butterflies going.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.450
- Well, you know,
I don't get the butterflies.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.753
I just throw up
before every live show.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.522
- We're live in 30 seconds.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.623
- Wait, I didn't throw up yet.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.727
How do you sit?

05:28.729 --> 05:30.095
Do you sit--
do you cross your legs much?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.531
- I don't, but I can't.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.733
- Okay, everybody, stand by.

05:34.735 --> 05:38.770
In 5, 4, 3, 2...

05:38.772 --> 05:40.405
- Listen, can I get--
- hello again, everybody.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.406
I'm roy firestone,

05:41.408 --> 05:43.075
And this is sportscall.

05:43.077 --> 05:44.609
Our guest all this week

05:44.611 --> 05:45.977
From the great
laker championship team

05:45.979 --> 05:47.479
Is mr. James worthy,

05:47.481 --> 05:48.680
And as always,

05:48.682 --> 05:50.349
The radio voice
of the new york mets,

05:50.351 --> 05:51.350
Mr. Kevin daniels.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.451
Good to see you, kevin.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.618
- Roy.
James.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.354
How are you, folks?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.622
- And a brand-new face
from newsday,

05:57.624 --> 05:59.691
A fine columnist,
mr. Ray barone.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.926
Good to see you,
ray.

06:00.928 --> 06:05.864
- Howdy.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.865
- Our subject tonight--

06:06.867 --> 06:08.133
Athletes and steroids.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.434
As you might know,

06:09.436 --> 06:10.769
There's an increasing
use of steroids

06:10.771 --> 06:11.769
Among amateur athletes,

06:11.771 --> 06:15.107
And, ray, you wrote a very
interesting piece about that.

06:15.109 --> 06:16.641
- Ahem, yes, I did, roy.

06:18.911 --> 06:20.645
- Why don't you tell us
about that, ray?

06:20.647 --> 06:22.414
- Um...

06:22.416 --> 06:23.515
It's a growing problem.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.083
It's a growing problem.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.552
Steroids is--

06:27.554 --> 06:28.620
I'd say it's even--

06:28.622 --> 06:29.654
It's gotten to be
a bit of a...

06:31.457 --> 06:32.457
- Epidemic?

06:32.459 --> 06:33.992
- No, no, no,

06:33.994 --> 06:35.494
It's not an epidemic.
It's out of control.

06:35.496 --> 06:39.898
It's kind of like a...

06:39.900 --> 06:40.899
All: Epidemic.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.435
- Yeah.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.736
What they did was,

06:44.738 --> 06:46.405
They took a group
of olympic athletes,

06:46.407 --> 06:48.607
And they axed them
if using steroids

06:48.609 --> 06:50.575
Would guarantee you
a gold medal

06:50.577 --> 06:52.411
But would also kill you
in five years,

06:52.413 --> 06:53.712
Would you still do it?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.148
64% of them said yes.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.482
- Wow, really?

06:57.484 --> 06:58.617
- That's alarming.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.424
- I really enjoyed the piece.
A terrific piece.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.625
You did a great job.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.093
- Oh, thanks.
Thanks, roy.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.162
You know, when a program
succeeds like that,

07:10.164 --> 07:12.531
A lot of that stuff just gets
swept right under the rug.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.965
- Right.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.600
And what's gonna
happen is that

07:15.602 --> 07:18.837
It's later that these kids
are gonna realize that--

07:18.839 --> 07:22.073
Oh, they've made
a horrible mistake, you know?

07:22.075 --> 07:23.608
They don't realize it
at first...

07:23.610 --> 07:25.577
[scratching amplified
by microphone]

07:25.579 --> 07:28.980
But what happens is, you know,
they're sacrificing what once,

07:28.982 --> 07:31.049
You know, was the ideal.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.653
The ideal dream.
The american dream, you know.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.856
[voice obscured by scratching]

07:37.858 --> 07:38.990
But I have to tell you
this one thing...

07:45.565 --> 07:46.565
- Hello.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.468
- Hooray!
- Yay! Yay!

07:49.470 --> 07:50.769
- What are you doing?
Come on.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.769
- Capturing the moment.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.238
- All right, come on,
dad, cut it out.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.106
- Great action shot!

07:55.108 --> 07:56.675
- Oh, come on,

07:56.677 --> 07:59.611
Let me be the first one
to hug my big tv star.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.779
Whoo!
- It wasn't that good.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.148
- Hey, frank,
take a picture.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.616
- Come on, come on,
come on.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.718
- They should give you the show.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.620
You're better
than that other guy.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.921
- Kevin?
- No, no, the other one,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.591
The one who was acting
like the boss.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.125
- Roy firestone?

08:14.127 --> 08:15.760
- You were the whole show!

08:15.762 --> 08:17.262
- Come on.

08:24.971 --> 08:28.573
- Now you got television.

08:28.575 --> 08:29.574
Way to go.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.912
- Frankly, I felt a little
awkward there, you know.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.580
- Oh, you'd never know.

08:35.582 --> 08:39.551
- Here's james worthy
listening to you talk.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.052
- You took pictures of me
on the television.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.053
- Sure.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.723
How often is my son on the tube?

08:44.725 --> 08:46.691
- I was on when
we busted john gotti.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.762
- Yes, but you didn't have
any lines, dear.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.734
- So what did you think?
- Oh, you were great.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.835
What did they say at the show?

08:56.837 --> 08:58.069
- Yeah, I think they liked me.
- Yeah?

08:58.071 --> 09:00.105
- Of course they liked you!

09:00.107 --> 09:02.841
- It was like watching
joe garagiola.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.845
- Look, this one is roy smiling

09:06.847 --> 09:08.079
At something I said right there.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.214
- I remember when he did that.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.583
Yeah, I saw that.
That was great.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.018
They like you.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.986
- All right,
all right, come on!

09:14.988 --> 09:16.955
It's a tv show.
That's all it is.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.056
We could blow that one up.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.191
That one could get blown up.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.192
- Ray!

09:30.336 --> 09:31.937
- Hey, I was just
talking to kevin--

09:31.939 --> 09:32.937
- Ray, look at this.
Look at this.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.906
Ally drew another
picture of our family,

09:34.908 --> 09:36.575
And she still says
that these monsters

09:36.577 --> 09:37.809
Aren't your parents.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.579
- All right, so maybe...

09:40.581 --> 09:41.313
Maybe they're not.

09:41.315 --> 09:42.981
- Ray, this one is bald,

09:42.983 --> 09:44.783
And this one's carrying
a covered dish.

09:50.957 --> 09:51.956
- You know what?
Save that.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.327
Someday a therapist
may want to see it.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.829
Listen, I was just
talking to kevin,

09:57.831 --> 09:59.931
And harvey johnson's gonna
be out again tomorrow,

09:59.933 --> 10:01.733
So they want me
to do the show again.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.702
- Oh, I thought it was
just a one-time deal.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.270
- Yeah, well,
things went pretty well there.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.371
Everybody seemed to like it,

10:06.373 --> 10:07.806
So I figured, hey, why not?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.975
- Hey, great, great.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.943
Yeah, that's really great.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.181
- What?

10:16.183 --> 10:17.782
- Nothing.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.284
- Well, I mean,
you're pursing your lips.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.719
What's wrong?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.053
- I'm not pursing.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.294
- Puh-puh-puh!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.763
- What?
No, I just--

10:31.765 --> 10:32.763
Okay.

10:32.765 --> 10:33.832
Okay, it's just...

10:33.834 --> 10:35.900
Maybe before the next show,
you could...

10:35.902 --> 10:37.369
Just practice a few words

10:37.371 --> 10:39.304
You kind of had
just a little bit of trouble

10:39.306 --> 10:40.305
Saying tonight.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.339
- Like what--
- no, no, no.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.374
Don't get so excited.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.109
It is not a big deal.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.011
- Come on,
I'm gonna be on television.

10:46.013 --> 10:46.811
- Okay, look.

10:50.683 --> 10:51.883
"asterisk."

10:51.885 --> 10:54.085
You were talking
about some record

10:54.087 --> 10:55.420
That had an asterisk
next to it.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.955
- Yeah? Yeah?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.724
- Yeah.
Asterisk.

10:59.726 --> 11:03.395
- Well, come on.
Asterix.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.864
Asterix.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.265
I said asterix
on television!

11:07.267 --> 11:08.333
- It's okay.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.701
No, no, no, no,
it's okay. Just...

11:09.703 --> 11:11.236
Just...Asterisk.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.704
- Asterix.
- Asterisk.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.072
- Asterix.
- Aster--

11:14.074 --> 11:15.974
- Oh, I know!
Stop showing off!

11:15.976 --> 11:18.109
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You know what?

11:18.111 --> 11:20.211
Maybe it would be easier if you
just break it into two parts.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.246
Aster, risk.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.981
- Aster, risk.

11:22.983 --> 11:23.982
- Asterisk.

11:23.984 --> 11:24.983
- Asterix.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.151
Ohh.

11:26.153 --> 11:29.921
- You know, ray,
nobody even cares.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.190
Next time that word comes up,
maybe just say...

11:32.192 --> 11:33.825
Little star.

11:33.827 --> 11:34.959
- What else?
What else?

11:34.961 --> 11:35.960
What other words?

11:35.962 --> 11:37.762
- Well, I mean,

11:37.764 --> 11:38.963
You're asking me, right?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.699
- Yeah.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.101
- You're asking me.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.235
- Yeah, what are you doing?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.104
I'm axing you.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.406
Oh.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.340
- Yeah.
"ask."

11:49.342 --> 11:50.709
Sometimes you say...

11:50.711 --> 11:51.710
- Ax.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.711
Ax.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.879
Oh, man.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.414
- No, no, no,
honey, come on.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.283
You just got to practice
those words.

11:58.285 --> 12:01.152
Just practice those words.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.153
- Why?

12:02.155 --> 12:04.089
Why didn't you tell me this?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.190
You should've told me

12:05.192 --> 12:08.426
The first time
I axed you something.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.062
- I never thought you were gonna
be on television.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.163
You know what we could do?

12:12.165 --> 12:13.798
Let's put them all
in a sentence.

12:13.800 --> 12:19.170
Say, um, "I asked you to put
the asterisk with the...

12:19.172 --> 12:21.773
Cinnamon."

12:21.775 --> 12:23.308
- Cinnamum?

12:23.310 --> 12:26.111
Cinnamum.
Cinnamum.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.112
Oh, my god, I'm a monkey.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.050
Did I say cinnamum on the show?

12:32.052 --> 12:33.184
- No, no, no, no.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.285
It's just a good thing to know

12:34.287 --> 12:37.288
For when we're at the ihop.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.288
Come on.
Come on.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.459
"I asked you to put the asterisk
with the cinnamon."

12:41.461 --> 12:43.094
- I asked you...
- Good. Good.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.263
- To put the asterisk

12:45.265 --> 12:46.264
With the cinnamum.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.800
Cinnam--

12:48.802 --> 12:49.801
All right, you know what?

12:49.803 --> 12:50.802
No more ihop.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.939
- Ray, it's--

12:54.941 --> 12:56.541
It's just those
couple of words, that's all.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.541
I mean, you were really--

12:57.543 --> 12:59.144
We told you
you were great on the show.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.378
- Yeah, you told me.
You told me.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.378
I believed you.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.047
- No, really, honey,
you were terrific.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.084
- Oh, don't, don't!

13:06.086 --> 13:06.985
I'm sorry I axed.

13:17.963 --> 13:18.963
- Hi.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.031
- Oh, hi, dear.
You hungry?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.199
- No.

13:21.201 --> 13:25.937
- Sit down.
I'll make you a sandwich.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.372
- Oh, ally gave you
one of her paintings?

13:27.374 --> 13:28.907
- Yeah.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.141
Look how big we are

13:30.143 --> 13:31.409
Compared to the rest
of the family.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.280
- Yeah, that's great.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.280
Listen...

13:36.282 --> 13:39.384
You guys ever notice that I say
certain words funny?

13:39.386 --> 13:40.819
- What do you mean?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.987
Like glockenspiel or tushy?

13:46.058 --> 13:47.325
- Not funny words, dad.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.426
Do I mispronounce words?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.094
I'm just axing.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.831
- No, I think you speak
beautifully, dear.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.832
Why?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.533
What's wrong?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.836
- Debra thought I had trouble
on the show last night

13:57.838 --> 13:58.903
With certain words.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.438
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.907
It sounds like she's being
a little nitpicky.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.375
- Yeah?

14:04.377 --> 14:05.977
So you really think I was
all right last night?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.312
- Yeah.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.847
- Oh, good. Good,

14:08.849 --> 14:10.114
'cause I'm gonna do it
again tonight.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.349
- They want you back?

14:14.486 --> 14:16.154
- What does that mean?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.622
- Nothing,
it's just that we--

14:17.624 --> 14:21.993
We thought it was over.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.261
- So you did notice
the words.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.929
- Listen, you got
bigger problems

14:24.931 --> 14:25.997
Than your little words there.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.068
- Like what?

14:30.070 --> 14:32.203
- Like scratching
the microphone.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.972
Nobody could hear
what the hell was going on.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.241
- But at least the scratching

14:36.243 --> 14:37.642
Kept him from waving
his hands around

14:37.644 --> 14:39.611
Like he was landing planes.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.446
- The microphone was much worse.
- No, no.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.381
- It seemed like he'd never been
on television before.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.416
- He never has been
on television before,

14:45.418 --> 14:47.352
But he's had his hands
his whole life.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.120
- The microphone was
much more annoying!

14:49.122 --> 14:52.523
Ray, which
is more annoying?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.025
This....

14:54.027 --> 14:55.026
Or this?

14:55.028 --> 14:57.262
[imitates microphone
crackling]

14:57.264 --> 14:58.329
- I did that?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.231
- Yeah.
Now that you mention it,

15:00.233 --> 15:01.933
Your voice was
kind of monotonous.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.102
- I didn't mention that.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.939
- Well, you tended to
drone on and on, dear.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.642
- It was very off-putting.

15:10.644 --> 15:12.510
- My god.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.979
- You see? Like that.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.181
Most people would say,
"my god!"

15:21.186 --> 15:23.187
You got to try
and make your voice

15:23.189 --> 15:25.323
Go up and down more,

15:25.325 --> 15:27.659
High and low.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.394
I would absolutely love

15:29.396 --> 15:33.598
A nice dill pickle.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.667
Pickle, marie.

15:35.669 --> 15:36.668
- Oh, oh.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.407
- Wait, so...

15:43.409 --> 15:45.343
So let me get this
straight, dad.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.245
Everything you said
after the show last night

15:47.247 --> 15:48.980
Was a lie,
and behind my back,

15:48.982 --> 15:50.148
You've been talking
about how bad I was.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.420
You think I stunk.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.988
You think I stunk!

15:56.990 --> 15:59.023
- Oh, what difference
does it make what we think?

15:59.025 --> 16:00.558
They asked you back.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.660
- But keep in mind
some of the things we told you,

16:02.662 --> 16:06.197
Because I got to see
people during the day.

16:06.199 --> 16:10.501
- Oh, my god.
The supermarket.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.501
- You lie to me.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.404
You lie to me,
and you do it so well.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.406
How long has this
been going on?

16:15.408 --> 16:17.108
- Three weeks.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.984
- Oh, my god, look at you.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.385
Look at you.
Oh, my god.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.288
You've been lying to me
my whole life, haven't you?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.190
"oh, raymond,
you're such a great writer,

16:32.192 --> 16:33.758
You could've been
writing poetry."

16:33.760 --> 16:35.426
How about in high school, ma?

16:35.428 --> 16:36.561
"oh, don't worry, ray,
the girls,

16:36.563 --> 16:38.129
They don't know
what they're missing."

16:38.131 --> 16:39.364
They knew!

16:39.366 --> 16:41.132
They knew,
and they didn't miss it.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.133
How about this, ma?

16:42.135 --> 16:43.501
Were you lying when you said,

16:43.503 --> 16:44.501
"oh, the day you were born

16:44.503 --> 16:46.037
Was the happiest day
of our lives"?

16:46.039 --> 16:48.606
- No, that's true, it was.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.410
Don't eat that now, robert.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.749
- What's going on?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.784
- You know they've been lying
to us our whole lives?

16:59.786 --> 17:02.487
Any time they ever tried to make
us feel good about ourselves.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.688
- When did that happen to me?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.160
- Oh, honey, I'm sure
we lied to you plenty of times.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.131
- You got to get
your own place, man.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.465
- Oh, don't be silly.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.466
We love having you here.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.505
- Oh, my god.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.505
- Ray...

17:21.507 --> 17:23.608
We told you
you were a good writer

17:23.610 --> 17:26.210
So that you would think
you were a good writer, see?

17:26.212 --> 17:28.079
Then somebody gave you a job.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.680
That's what parents do.

17:29.682 --> 17:33.518
They all lie to their kids
for their own good.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.186
- But other parents
aren't lying, ma.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.654
They believe
in their children.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.189
- No, they don't.

17:43.695 --> 17:44.695
- All right, that's it.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.797
That's it, okay?

17:45.799 --> 17:47.098
No more lies, all right?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.599
Don't help me anymore!

17:48.601 --> 17:51.736
- That was good:
High and low.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.238
Use that on the show tonight.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.339
- Oh, my god,

17:55.341 --> 17:56.774
I can't believe I got to
do a show now.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.076
- You'll be wonderful, dear.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.211
- Ma, please, no more lies!

18:03.515 --> 18:05.817
- They say that because the pros
can hit it so far

18:05.819 --> 18:08.686
That they should lengthen
the length of all the courses,

18:08.688 --> 18:10.455
And, uh...

18:10.457 --> 18:12.690
You know, I know
I'm probably droning on here,

18:12.692 --> 18:14.358
But, um...

18:14.360 --> 18:15.827
But what about tradition?

18:15.829 --> 18:18.863
There's always tradition
and history and stuff,

18:18.865 --> 18:22.266
And I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know,

18:22.268 --> 18:24.702
I support the changes
in baseball, but--

18:24.704 --> 18:26.204
Look, let me ax--
ax--

18:26.206 --> 18:27.672
Ask you something here.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.240
Uh...

18:29.242 --> 18:32.810
Shouldn't a sport sometimes
should adopt--adapt--

18:32.812 --> 18:34.712
Adapt and grow,
but aren't there times

18:34.714 --> 18:36.481
That a sport
shouldn't adopt--adapt--

18:36.483 --> 18:38.249
And, uh...

18:38.251 --> 18:39.250
And not grow?

18:39.252 --> 18:40.251
Probably not grow.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.546
- Oh, hi, honey.

19:10.415 --> 19:11.782
That didn't go
very well, did it?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.189
- Not your best moment there,
raymond.

19:22.461 --> 19:23.761
- What are you doing?

19:23.763 --> 19:24.929
- We're being honest.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.498
You said
that's what you wanted.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.433
- I could've eaten
a box of alpha-bits

19:29.435 --> 19:30.835
And crapped
a better interview.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.350
- Well, what did you think?

19:46.352 --> 19:48.719
- Honey, I begged you to say
"little star."

19:50.923 --> 19:53.291
- It was even worse
than last time.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.360
- You made me hate tv.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.300
- Want me to play it back
for you, raymond?

20:04.303 --> 20:06.204
- All right, all right.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.506
All right, come on, I wanted you
to be honest, but...

20:08.508 --> 20:10.942
It couldn't have been
all bad.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.277
Dad, I made my voice
go high and low like you said.

20:13.279 --> 20:16.347
- That didn't work.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.216
- What about my little
steinbrenner joke?

20:18.218 --> 20:19.750
- Wasn't funny.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.752
It's not nice to hurt
other people's feelings.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.987
- Well, what about this?

20:22.989 --> 20:24.488
- This is funny.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.260
- All right, come on.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.361
I mean, it could've been--

20:30.363 --> 20:31.729
There had to be something there.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.930
I was--

20:32.932 --> 20:34.632
I sat there, and...

20:34.634 --> 20:36.467
Come on.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.903
Come on!

20:38.905 --> 20:41.839
- I thought there were
a lot of good things, ray.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.840
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.375
Like, those other guys are so

20:44.377 --> 20:45.776
Polished and professional,

20:45.778 --> 20:47.712
And you were really,
like, human.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.747
All: Yeah.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.015
- Yeah, but what about
what I said, though?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.016
I mean, did it make sense?

20:52.018 --> 20:53.884
- Oh, yes.
Yeah.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.488
I got some of it.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.290
- So I mean, it wasn't
a total disaster?

20:59.292 --> 21:01.892
- Ah, no.
- Not what we meant at all.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.495
- Well, how many
total disasters are there?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.333
- Ray, the fact that you could
go on live television

21:09.335 --> 21:10.434
With such little experience--

21:10.436 --> 21:12.470
That really says a lot.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.738
- You were great, dear.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.273
- At least I tried it, right?

21:15.275 --> 21:16.274
I mean, it's better.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.541
It's better to try than to...

21:17.543 --> 21:18.542
Not try.

21:18.544 --> 21:19.744
- Yes!

21:19.746 --> 21:22.546
[all talking at once]

21:24.916 --> 21:26.817
- Okay!

21:26.819 --> 21:27.818
Okay.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.656
Thanks.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.392
- Better than broadway.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.893
- Okay.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.328
All right,
I got some makeup on.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.329
I'm gonna take
the makeup off,

21:38.331 --> 21:39.330
And then I'll come back.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.931
- Okay.
Yeah.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.833
You were so good, I bet they
have you back on again.

21:42.835 --> 21:43.934
I'm sure they will.

21:43.936 --> 21:44.969
- It's all about you,
raymond.

21:50.342 --> 21:50.941
- Robert.

22:03.955 --> 22:07.491
- Whew.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.527
I don't think
that was a total disaster.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.329
[chuckles]

22:13.532 --> 22:16.033
- Well, how many total disasters
are there?
