17:20.406 --> 17:23.467
Your Honor, may I address the court?

17:24.042 --> 17:26.773
- Listen, I-- I don't--
- I...

17:28.180 --> 17:29.204
...am a hooker.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.645
Renee, don't.

17:30.816 --> 17:37.153
You see, I degrade myself for money
because I don't like myself very much.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.257
- Please.
- No, that's--

17:39.425 --> 17:41.894
That's not entirely true.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.424
I don't like myself at all.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.292
[WHIMPERING]
And this man...

17:50.903 --> 17:54.203
...made me feel like a princess.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.308
Do you know why?

18:01.013 --> 18:03.141
You know why?

18:04.050 --> 18:06.781
Well, I don't know why either.

18:06.953 --> 18:11.515
[SOBBING]
Can somebody please tell me why?

18:11.691 --> 18:14.023
Okay, okay. It's gonna be okay.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.059
- Let's call it a night, Mac.
- Right.

18:16.228 --> 18:19.163
- Uh, I'll get her some water.
- Thank you, Flo.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.597
Everything under control, Bull?

18:27.373 --> 18:31.674
Right. I've been meaning to go in
for that brain scan.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.709
All right, folks, show's over.

18:38.217 --> 18:42.313
Why did she have to do this?
Now I feel sorry for her.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.752
Let's take her into my office.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.620
Maybe I'll get one for Christmas.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.367
Okay, now take a deep breath.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.366
Feel any better?

18:59.538 --> 19:01.597
I feel dizzy and nauseous.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.005
Reality. Does that to you sometimes.

19:05.411 --> 19:09.871
I don't even know why
I came here, but I knew I just had to.

19:10.049 --> 19:14.077
I think it had something to do
with self-respect.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.915
You had an attack of dignity.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.121
Hopefully, it's chronic.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.420
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

19:26.065 --> 19:27.931
Should we call a doctor?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.063
Good idea.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.704
- You hurt?
- No.

19:31.871 --> 19:37.139
I would like somebody
to take an x-ray of you...

19:37.309 --> 19:39.243
...to tell me what you are.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.609
Because no man
can be that compassionate.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.484
You're wrong there, Renee.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.813
<i>He's</i> a man, all right.

19:47.987 --> 19:51.150
Admittedly, there aren't many around
who are as special as he is...

19:51.323 --> 19:53.121
...but there are a few.

19:53.292 --> 19:58.059
And, if we're lucky.
If we're very, very lucky...

19:58.230 --> 20:01.791
...one crosses our path in a lifetime.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.569
Are we talking about the film <i>Gandhi?</i>

20:09.675 --> 20:11.200
Some of them are cute too.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.845
[CHUCKLES]

20:13.012 --> 20:16.004
- Come on, now. Upsy-daisy.
- I feel so embarrassed.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.344
Oh, forget it.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.447
You know something?

20:21.353 --> 20:23.947
It's not what other people think
that counts.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.717
It's how we feel about ourselves.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.382
[SIGHS]

20:28.561 --> 20:31.155
You make me feel beautiful.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.794
Yeah, well, red's your color.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.991
Ha, ha. It's not the dress.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.967
I know, but if I hear one more compliment,
I think I'm gonna throw up.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.264
[CHUCKLES]

20:40.439 --> 20:42.669
Hey, that reminds me, I'm hungry.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.639
- How about you?
- Yeah, I could use a bite.

20:48.814 --> 20:53.217
Great. I know this quaint little
all-you-can-eat liver joint down the block.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.218
If you'll be there,
then it's gonna be wonderful.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.618
[CHUCKLES]

21:07.933 --> 21:10.300
He is one special man.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.233
Yeah, he is.

21:12.404 --> 21:15.203
Come on, I know a quaint little
all-you-can-eat kelp bar...

21:15.374 --> 21:17.468
...next to the liver joint.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.004
Dan.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.210
It's time.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.855
Sheila, ha, ha, about the wheelchair--

21:32.024 --> 21:33.321
Shh.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.551
You're talking again, Dan.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.625
By the way...

21:38.798 --> 21:42.098
...three of my friends from Sweden
will be joining us.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.329
I'm afraid they're not very bright.

21:45.504 --> 21:46.994
I hope you don't mind.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.235
Good.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.811
The hotel address is on the key.

21:53.979 --> 21:58.644
We'll be waiting for you
in the Marquis de Sade suite.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.142
Bite.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.416
Don't be late...

22:05.591 --> 22:08.492
...or we'll have to start without you.

22:21.707 --> 22:25.575
Light a candle for me.

22:31.650 --> 22:34.244
Uh, could you give me a hand, please?

22:36.322 --> 22:38.256
Bravo. Huzzah.

22:39.091 --> 22:43.050
- No, really. Come on, I'm serious.
- Come on, gang. Kelp's on me.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.561
Wait. No, no, no, wait. You wouldn't.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.962
We would, we want to, we did.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.766
Flo. Flo.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.534
Phil. Phil.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.199
Come here, come here, come here.
Hurry up.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.936
Look, they are waiting.
You have to help me out.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.206
Sure, pal.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.287
