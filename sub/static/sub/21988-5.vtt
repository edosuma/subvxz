WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:06.507
WOMAN:
Okay, everybody, here we go.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.677
Meeting time.

00:09.710 --> 00:13.181
Melissa, whenever
you're ready to start.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.287
(exhales)

00:19.320 --> 00:24.092
My sponsor says that
this program is simple.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.526
"Just let go and let God."

00:25.559 --> 00:26.794
But since she's not
here this morning,

00:26.827 --> 00:29.097
I'll have to be honest
and tell you

00:29.130 --> 00:31.432
that I have no idea
what that means.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.101
(laughter)

00:33.134 --> 00:34.702
You know, when I let go,
it usually involves

00:34.735 --> 00:37.071
a bottle of Jack
and a jail cell.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.440
God has yet
to bail me out.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.410
But I'm sober today,
a month and some change...

00:42.443 --> 00:43.711
(chuckles)

00:43.744 --> 00:47.715
And I owe it all
to the people that I've

00:47.748 --> 00:49.317
met in these rooms.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.051
(applause)

00:58.592 --> 01:00.628
Clay?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.696
Would you like to share?

01:04.865 --> 01:06.667
(clears throat)

01:06.700 --> 01:10.104
Pass.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.242
Hey.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.709
Hey.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.877
Great share today.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.247
Oh. Thanks.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.882
You know, I've been
coming to this meeting

01:21.915 --> 01:23.217
for over a month,
and I don't think

01:23.251 --> 01:25.419
I've heard you share
even once.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.255
I'm not judging,
by the way.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.123
You learn as much
from others.

01:31.259 --> 01:34.262
Well, I got
some good news

01:34.295 --> 01:35.696
I think you're
gonna like.

01:35.729 --> 01:39.233
I finally did it.
I dumped my boyfriend.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.203
I packed a bag and I-I
bailed late last night.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.838
And I'm officially homeless.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.407
(chuckles softly)

01:48.309 --> 01:51.179
Sometimes homeless is
an upgrade.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.614
He was about to do
something really stupid,

01:53.647 --> 01:55.283
and he thought I'd
go along with it.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.284
He thought wrong.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.285
Good for you.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.619
He didn't take it too well.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.754
Well, that's not
your concern, is it?

02:00.788 --> 02:04.158
He made it my concern.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.300
Why don't you just
finally turn

02:12.333 --> 02:13.601
that bastard in, Melissa?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.369
I can't do that.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.338
Well, at least let me have
a little word to the bloke.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.207
It's over, Clay.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.674
Now I got to run.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.875
I've got a friend
who's picking me up.

02:21.909 --> 02:22.943
She's taking me
apartment hunting

02:22.976 --> 02:25.313
before I head to work.
(chuckles)

02:42.863 --> 02:44.532
No, no, let go of me!

02:44.565 --> 02:46.234
(screams)

02:46.267 --> 02:47.501
Melissa!

02:49.002 --> 02:50.971
Melissa!

02:51.004 --> 02:54.242
*

03:31.412 --> 03:32.646
Rough morning, McGee?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.781
Terrible.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.483
It's Delilah, isn't it?

03:35.516 --> 03:37.285
She's leaving you
for somebody else?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.987
No, Delilah is not leaving me.
Not yet, at least.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.022
She may run for the hills
when she sees this.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.291
Whoa!

03:43.324 --> 03:45.293
(Torres laughing)

03:47.395 --> 03:50.030
Wow. Where-Where'd
you find this?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.332
It was in my in-box
this morning.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.401
Came from a fake e-mail account.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.470
Hmm. That is one
perfectly coiffed

03:56.504 --> 03:58.672
perm you got there, McGee.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.274
It's just a thing of beauty.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.510
Forget the hair, someone
turned me into a damn meme.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.545
I got memed.
What the hell's a meme?

04:04.578 --> 04:07.548
Oh, they're basically
shared images

04:07.581 --> 04:09.350
on social networks,

04:09.383 --> 04:11.385
and the funniest photos
get shared the most.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.886
The more you know,

04:12.920 --> 04:14.622
the less you understand.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.689
McGEE:
Boss, I never meant

04:15.723 --> 04:17.024
for this photo
to ever be seen,

04:17.057 --> 04:18.058
let alone turned
into a meme.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.693
I can see why, McGee.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.695
Hey, you're late--
you better have a good excuse.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.930
I just watched one of my friends

04:22.963 --> 04:24.465
get snatched
off the damn street.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.933
Where?
Across from the navy yard

04:25.966 --> 04:27.067
outside St. Peter's.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.536
I phoned Metro
and made a statement,

04:28.569 --> 04:29.803
but there wasn't much I could do

04:29.837 --> 04:31.071
because it all happened
so quickly.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.440
You get a make on the car?

04:32.473 --> 04:33.907
Nissan Altima, black.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.343
I didn't get eyes on the plate.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.076
You said the victim's a friend?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.878
Melissa's a good mate of mine.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.080
Last name?
I wish I knew.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.615
I've got a pretty good idea
who did it, though.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.650
Her ex.

04:42.683 --> 04:43.884
There a history of abuse?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.354
I knew she needed me.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.455
I could have saved her.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.089
You still can.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.492
It doesn't fall under
NCIS jurisdiction, Gibbs.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.061
And you don't care.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.396
That's good to know.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.797
So, I took the liberty
of texting

04:56.830 --> 04:58.832
a selfie of Melissa and me
down to Abby.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.001
She's running it through
facial recognition as we speak.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.302
Go.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.105
Uh, Clay, wait up.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.540
Don't you think
it's kind of strange

05:06.574 --> 05:07.808
not to know
your friend's last name?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.042
I think it's a little strange

05:09.076 --> 05:10.478
to go to church
on Tuesday mornings.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.412
Well...

05:11.445 --> 05:13.581
Might be a British thing.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.984
Still no match?
Uh, no.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.819
And I don't expect one
anytime soon.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.522
I mean, I am fishing
in a vast ocean here.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.590
Well, how do we make
the ocean a pond?

05:22.623 --> 05:23.757
By only searching

05:23.791 --> 05:25.393
Web sites and networks

05:25.426 --> 05:26.660
that are connected to Melissa.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.662
Like, what type of work
does she do?

05:28.696 --> 05:29.863
She's a secretary.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.465
Works for the
government, I think.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.001
Well, a government job
in D.C., imagine that.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.404
And she talks a lot about
her childhood dachshund,

05:36.437 --> 05:37.571
uh, Theodore.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.473
Does Theodore have
a Facebook page?

05:39.507 --> 05:41.442
No, he's a dog, Abby.
No thumbs.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.444
Owners who build pages
about their pets

05:43.477 --> 05:44.244
are, like,
a dime a dozen.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.446
You got to get
with the times, Clay.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.047
I know she likes to play

05:47.080 --> 05:48.682
old-school arcade games,
like Ms. Pac-Man.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.950
She rides a bike
at the weekend,

05:49.983 --> 05:51.051
even joined some club.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.053
Like a Hells Angels-type club?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.055
No, like a ten-speed-type club.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.558
Oh, too bad. I was
picturing little Theodore

05:57.591 --> 06:00.628
in, like, a tiny,
badass leather vest.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.597
Okay, I got a match.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.766
REEVES: That's her.
Melissa Goodman.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.568
I'll see what
I can find on her.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.105
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.874
And-and you don't have
to answer.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.443
Are you a, um...

06:15.476 --> 06:16.977
a friend of Bill's?

06:20.581 --> 06:21.549
Yes.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.050
I knew it.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.618
I mean, church
on a Tuesday morning.

06:24.652 --> 06:27.655
Most priests aren't
even that godly.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.156
Does anyone else know?

06:29.189 --> 06:31.859
Just Bishop.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.027
We traveled through
Scotland together last year,

06:34.061 --> 06:37.130
and she'd see me go off
to these meetings.

06:37.164 --> 06:40.033
Well, if you ever
need to talk, the...

06:40.067 --> 06:42.736
Sciutos descend
from a long line

06:42.770 --> 06:44.171
of over-indulgers.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.906
I know what a struggle it is.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.408
And I'm really proud of you.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.980
Uh, Melissa Goodman's
apartment is co-leased

06:53.013 --> 06:54.582
with an Edward Holdren.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.315
REEVES:
Has to be the boyfriend.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.650
BISHOP:
He drives a black Altima

06:56.684 --> 06:58.085
and is a civilian engineer

06:58.118 --> 07:00.688
who works for the Office
of Naval Intelligence...

07:00.721 --> 07:03.657
REEVES:
Thanks, Abby.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.493
We have the address
for Melissa's apartment

07:05.526 --> 07:07.461
in Anacostia.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.996
Up until yesterday, she lived
there with her boyfriend,

07:09.029 --> 07:10.498
who works for the ONI.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.999
File's been flagged.
Flagged for what?

07:12.032 --> 07:14.067
That's a good question.
Bishop, take Reeves.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.603
Check out her place.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.005
Nick, come on.
Let's go.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.907
REDDING:
Doing everything I can.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.543
Yeah, I know.
(knock on door)

07:22.576 --> 07:24.478
I'll call you back.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.646
Captain Redding?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.148
Special Agents Gibbs

07:28.181 --> 07:29.583
and Torres, NCIS.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.151
We're looking
for Edward Holdren.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.520
Well, join the club.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.588
I was just about to call NCIS.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.189
Eddie Holdren's
a chief engineer

07:36.223 --> 07:37.925
on one of our
classified projects.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.693
He's been U.A.
for the last two days.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.962
Well, that explains why
his file was flagged.

07:41.995 --> 07:47.134
This isn't just about his
little disappearing act.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.569
Would you shut that?

07:53.674 --> 07:57.010
He has a laptop,
and it is loaded

07:57.044 --> 07:59.513
with some of our
most sensitive intel.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.048
Concerning what?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.917
Sorry, that's "need to know."

08:14.928 --> 08:16.997
I gave some thought
to becoming a cop.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.732
It wasn't in the
cards, though.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.033
You want to know why?
Mm.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.869
I've got flat feet.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.006
Okay, here we are, this is
Melissa and Eddie's place.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.975
Before I let you in, can you
clue me in on what you're...?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.710
Can you step away
from the door?
(sighing): All right.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.545
Thank you.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.518
REEVES:
NCIS!

08:47.728 --> 08:48.962
(pulls back curtain)

08:50.631 --> 08:52.633
Clear.
Clear.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.271
Well... it seems like
he left in a hurry.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.740
The place is a mess.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.109
Newspaper's two days old.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.011
BISHOP: Melissa and Eddie
in happier times.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.981
I've got something.
Hmm?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.116
Broken lamp.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.784
Eddie threw it at Melissa

09:10.818 --> 09:12.219
during a fight last week.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.254
She shared about it
the next day.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.626
Looks like blood.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.793
REEVES:
Found some more.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.999
(sighs)

09:26.033 --> 09:29.136
Melissa needed me.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.672
(sighs)
And I dropped the ball.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.841
(dog barking)

09:36.209 --> 09:38.045
Will you look at this moron?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.713
Hey.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.186
Don't you think it's time you
told Gibbs how you know Melissa?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.288
I mean, now that this is
officially our case?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.958
Our case, my life.
Yeah, but

09:50.991 --> 09:52.993
what are you afraid of, Clay?
I mean, you really think Gibbs,

09:53.026 --> 09:54.194
or anyone else
for that matter,

09:54.227 --> 09:55.696
is gonna judge you?

09:55.729 --> 09:59.667
Can you, um, get those to Abby?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.269
Where are you going?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.772
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.346
(clears throat)

10:13.380 --> 10:15.816
Agent Sloane?
Yep?

10:15.849 --> 10:17.317
Clayton Reeves, MI6.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.053
Well, hello there,
Clayton Reeves, MI6,

10:20.087 --> 10:21.154
What can I do for you?

10:21.188 --> 10:22.690
I want some advice.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.758
We're investigating
an abduction.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.727
Victim, Melissa Goodman.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.097
Suspect, Eddie Holdren.
Only witness, you.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.032
I just filled her in
on the case.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.234
He asked me to build
a profile of Eddie Holdren.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.303
Great.
And I told him

10:36.336 --> 10:38.105
it would take me some time,

10:38.138 --> 10:39.406
which, unfortunately,
you don't have.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.743
First 24 hours
in an abduction is critical.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.778
I know. We don't
even have a lead

10:44.812 --> 10:46.179
on where Holdren's
taken Melissa.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.148
You'll find one--
that's what you do best.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.751
Let me worry about the mindset
of her boyfriend--

10:50.784 --> 10:52.185
that's what I do best.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.321
You know, I still can't believe
I let this happen.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.756
She's your friend.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.024
Keep your focus.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.026
Keep your emotions out of it.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.828
It's not your fault.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.229
I know.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.964
You say that, but I don't think

11:03.997 --> 11:05.298
you completely believe it,
do you?

11:09.002 --> 11:12.873
Hey, was Melissa pretty open
with you about things?

11:12.906 --> 11:13.774
Yes.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.008
Was there anyone else

11:15.042 --> 11:16.810
she might have been
more open with?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.278
I think so.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.047
GIBBS:
Her sponsor?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.884
Gibbs, I was gonna...
Reeves, go.

11:28.822 --> 11:33.493
Still no transactions on Melissa
or Eddie Holdren's credit cards.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.095
I tried triangulating
their locations again,

11:35.128 --> 11:37.164
but both their cell
phones are shut off.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.299
Abby said the blood we found
in the apartment is a match

11:39.332 --> 11:40.233
for Melissa.
Apartment's clear,

11:40.267 --> 11:43.370
no sign of the ONI laptop
Holdren stole.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.475
Can I help you?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.211
You know, Bishop,
a wise man once said,

11:51.244 --> 11:53.814
"Do not keep secrets from people

11:53.847 --> 11:56.283
who make a living
being human lie detectors."

11:56.316 --> 11:57.484
You just made that up.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.220
Well, even if I did, a, a wise
man could have said that.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.956
Honesty is the cornerstone
of any great team.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.158
Don't you think,
Bishop?
I honestly wish you two

12:05.192 --> 12:07.427
would just man up
and say what's on your minds.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.897
All right, Reeves.
We don't think he's telling

12:09.930 --> 12:11.531
the full story
about this morning.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.000
And we don't think
he's the only one

12:13.033 --> 12:15.302
playing fast and loose
with the truth.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.537
You guys think I'm lying to you?
We think that if there was

12:17.570 --> 12:20.173
an honest police force,
you'd be the chief.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.442
Yeah, but you haven't even
questioned Reeves' story once.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.443
And you know
what I think?

12:23.476 --> 12:25.545
I think that you don't need
to ask questions,

12:25.578 --> 12:27.280
because you already know
the answers.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.316
I mean, come on, he doesn't know
his friend's last name?

12:29.349 --> 12:32.285
And who goes to church
on Tuesdays?

12:32.319 --> 12:34.154
An alcoholic.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.791
I was there for a
12-step meeting.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.294
That's how I
know Melissa.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.132
We're both in recovery.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.434
Gibbs figured it out.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.002
What took you two so long?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.103
It's not a big deal, Clay.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.304
Why didn't you just tell us?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.841
It's not something
I like to talk about.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.375
So I don't.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.110
Well, I respect that.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.948
And you.

13:00.981 --> 13:01.548
Me, too,

13:01.581 --> 13:02.582
Clay.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.084
Yeah, I was telling McGee

13:04.117 --> 13:06.119
we should just mind
our own business.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.388
Need to take a ride.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.361
You sure we're gonna find
Melissa's sponsor here?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.362
Her name's Nancy D.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.198
Her home group throws
a social here once a week.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.233
Melissa wouldn't miss it.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.334
Hey, uh,

13:21.368 --> 13:23.904
are all these people
really sober?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.238
Yes, Nick.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.274
It's a sober party.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.377
It's a sober party.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.279
Isn't that an oxymoron?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.514
I party sober
all the time.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.150
Here comes Scrabble night.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.152
Yeah, once a week Delilah
and I get together

13:39.186 --> 13:41.121
with some couples, do
competitive Scrabble.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.256
It's so crazy, we
stick to Diet Cokes.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.324
Dude.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.593
This is you, right?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.330
It is you.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.266
Ah, looks like
you chopped your lettuce.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.402
That's a
shame, man.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.106
What, my meme has
over 120,000 shares?

14:00.573 --> 14:02.275
Why are you smiling?
Huh?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.077
I'm not.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.916
Nancy D?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.317
Yes.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.886
Officer Reeves, NCIS.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.922
I need to talk
about one of your sponsees.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.224
Melissa Goodman.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.459
Oh, God, did something happen?
She usually checks in at night,

14:19.492 --> 14:22.095
but I haven't heard from her
in a couple of days.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.396
She's been abducted.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.065
What?

14:25.098 --> 14:27.034
When?

14:27.067 --> 14:30.337
Earlier this morning,
after our step-study
meeting at St. Peter's.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.106
You were there?
Melissa's a friend.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.607
Was it Eddie?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.312
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.548
I begged Melissa
to break up with him,

14:41.581 --> 14:43.216
but she just...

14:43.250 --> 14:45.085
she couldn't do it.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.353
The more that he
would hit her,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.021
the more she would
cover for him.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.589
Last week she had to hide out
at his cabin

14:49.622 --> 14:53.026
for a couple of days
just waiting for her
bruises to heal.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.462
What cabin?

15:06.473 --> 15:08.008
What the hell is this?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.576
Can't be good.
Black Altima.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.411
That's the car that I saw.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.416
Federal agents!

15:16.449 --> 15:18.685
He killed her.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.593
Clay?

15:26.626 --> 15:28.195
(gasps)

15:28.228 --> 15:31.198
(Melissa sobbing)

15:31.231 --> 15:33.000
I killed him.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.335
I had to.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.448
(takes deep breath)

15:48.481 --> 15:50.350
I can't stop shaking.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.751
Here, you want some water?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.386
How about a vodka neat?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.387
How about a double?

15:55.522 --> 15:58.291
Just some recovery humor.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.260
Thank God the girl
made it out alive.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.162
Must've put up
a hell of a fight.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.065
Any leads on the stolen laptop?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.699
Yeah, we're working on it, Leon.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.601
Well, work faster--
the undersecretary of the Navy

16:08.635 --> 16:10.770
just called to read me in
on Holdren's project.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.372
His team was
working on...

16:12.405 --> 16:14.041
Airtime Delta.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.776
That's the DoD's latest
unmanned aerial vehicle.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.313
That laptop houses
the operating system
and the design plans.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.315
Well, yeah,
that's definitely a problem.
(phone rings)

16:22.349 --> 16:23.783
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.418
I'm on my way.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.520
Palmer.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.323
How you doing?
Good. How we doing here?

16:30.357 --> 16:32.725
(crying):
I can't believe Eddie's dead.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.228
I know you think I'm crazy,

16:35.262 --> 16:37.064
but I loved him.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.498
Leaving Eddie was
the hardest thing

16:38.531 --> 16:39.632
I've ever done.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.401
How long were you two together?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.803
Two long years...

16:43.836 --> 16:46.106
for Eddie.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.641
(sniffles)

16:48.675 --> 16:51.444
He saw me at my worst.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.081
When-when I'd pass out
in-in-in the kitchen,

16:54.114 --> 16:56.416
he would pick me up
and he would bring me to bed.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.086
And... when
I was sick,

16:59.119 --> 17:00.420
he'd hold my hair back,

17:00.453 --> 17:02.489
It was Eddie
who got me sober.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.491
Only you could do that.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.359
Eddie knew I was sick,

17:06.393 --> 17:09.329
and-and he-he refused
to give up on me.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.499
(sniffles)
He believed in me.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.267
He beat you.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.335
You leaving him

17:15.368 --> 17:17.270
was the best decision
you ever made.

17:17.304 --> 17:20.473
I didn't leave him
because we fought, Clay.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.175
You know how I said

17:22.209 --> 17:24.611
he was planning on doing
something stupid?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.346
E-Eddie's team,

17:26.379 --> 17:29.349
they created some
groundbreaking drone,

17:29.382 --> 17:31.851
and Eddie thought it was, like,

17:31.884 --> 17:36.356
a good opportunity
to take the intel

17:36.389 --> 17:38.658
and sell it
to the highest bidder.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.493
And he thought you'd
go along with it.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.495
I flipped out.
I-I told him, I told him,

17:42.529 --> 17:44.531
I want no part of this.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.867
And I left
but I think he panicked.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.836
He must have thought that
I wanted to turn him in or...

17:49.869 --> 17:53.406
The next morning he...

17:53.440 --> 17:56.109
he grabbed me...

17:56.143 --> 17:58.778
and he, he drove us straight
to the cabin.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.481
How'd you get the gun
away from him?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.616
He was wobbling and s-slurring

18:03.650 --> 18:06.519
like, like he'd been drinking.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.155
And I knew why.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.223
He needed the liquid courage
to kill you.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.326
When he made his move...

18:13.360 --> 18:15.395
I made mine.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.265
And we-we fell to the ground,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.733
and we wrestled
for a bit, and then...

18:20.767 --> 18:24.171
Bam. (sobs)

18:24.204 --> 18:26.439
The gun just went off.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.709
Okay, listen.
Okay, listen, Melissa.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.744
You're doing great, okay?
We're nearly done here.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.447
I just need you to
help us figure out

18:34.481 --> 18:37.450
where Eddie has stashed
the stolen laptop.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.520
Do you think you can
do that for me?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.522
I'm sorry, Clay.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.625
I-I don't think I can.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.861
I told you everything I know.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.498
VANCE:
Well, I've seen
that look before.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.732
Talk to me, Jack.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.368
Intensive, sustained fear

18:55.402 --> 18:56.869
is often directly tethered

18:56.903 --> 18:59.206
to the suppression
of relevant memories.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.507
Are you saying

19:00.540 --> 19:02.342
that she might
know more than she realizes?

19:02.375 --> 19:05.278
Given the profound trauma
that she endured,

19:05.312 --> 19:06.713
it's only
reasonable to assume

19:06.746 --> 19:09.182
that her fear of
Eddie is paralyzing.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.384
Was paralyzing.
Eddie's dead.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.652
She should know that,
she killed him.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.888
Yes, and on a
cerebral level,

19:15.922 --> 19:18.758
she is aware that he's
no longer a threat,

19:18.791 --> 19:21.394
but in order to access
those suppressed memories,

19:21.428 --> 19:22.595
she needs to feel it, too.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.564
So what exactly
are you suggesting?

19:26.699 --> 19:29.602
It was a quick,
clean death.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.238
Single shot.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.772
Bullet through the heart.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.842
But, judging by the
skinned knuckles,

19:35.875 --> 19:38.445
the scraped knees,
the claw marks on his neck,

19:38.478 --> 19:40.613
I would say that the fight
that preceded the death

19:40.647 --> 19:42.582
was no holds barred.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.851
Down and dirty.
Got a tox report?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.620
Abby just sent it down,
so I'm still reviewing it,

19:47.654 --> 19:50.590
but Eddie Holdren
had 80 milligrams

19:50.623 --> 19:52.659
of the opioid oxycodone

19:52.692 --> 19:54.727
in his system.
That a lot?

19:54.761 --> 19:56.629
Gibbs, even if he
was a heavy user,

19:56.663 --> 19:59.499
and there's no indication that
he was, that would be enough

19:59.532 --> 20:02.235
to severely effect
his equilibrium.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.736
Probably made it
much easier for his victim

20:03.770 --> 20:05.572
to wrestle the gun
away from him.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.441
Dr. Palmer.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.977
Do you mind giving us a moment
with the deceased, please?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.545
Do I mind,
Agent Gibbs?

20:14.514 --> 20:15.948
No.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.617
No, I don't mind.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.421
(whispers):
Well, this is, uh, different.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.889
Yeah, well,

20:22.922 --> 20:26.526
new agents means new ideas.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.828
It's okay, he can't
hurt you anymore.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.631
All right.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.636
I'm so sorry, Eddie.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.272
I want you to know,

20:39.306 --> 20:42.375
I'll always remember
the good times.

20:48.481 --> 20:53.720
But no matter what,
I'll never forget the bad ones.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.426
Hey. It's hard.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.696
Why did you stay?

21:03.730 --> 21:06.699
I thought...

21:06.733 --> 21:11.604
if I tried hard enough,
I could help him.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.306
Help him how?

21:13.340 --> 21:15.608
I guess, help him

21:15.642 --> 21:18.010
to control his temper,

21:18.044 --> 21:19.746
but...

21:19.779 --> 21:21.714
he'd just control me more.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.883
He was so insecure.

21:23.916 --> 21:27.454
He'd freak out
if I didn't answer my phone

21:27.487 --> 21:28.588
by the second ring.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.722
I know the type.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.023
MELISSA:
And it only got worse.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.794
He started tagging along
on my bike club.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.796
Wanted to keep an eye on who

21:36.829 --> 21:38.598
I was talking to.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.567
So he was pretty obsessive.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.869
MELISSA:
Humiliating.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.904
I tried to sneak out
last weekend.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.740
Without him.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.478
And when I got to our
storage unit to get my bike,

21:51.511 --> 21:53.513
he'd changed the lock.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.782
Why would he change the lock?

21:55.815 --> 22:00.753
Figured he just... did not want
me to go to my bike club.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.022
Hey.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.957
Here you go.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.594
Let me just give you
a second alone.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.734
Or maybe he was hiding
something?

22:22.542 --> 22:24.544
You get that?

22:26.946 --> 22:31.017
Well, if someone wanted
to hide a laptop,

22:31.050 --> 22:33.586
this would be a prime spot.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.561
Hey.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.762
You okay?

22:42.795 --> 22:43.830
You've only said, like,

22:43.863 --> 22:45.698
two words since
we left the office.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.635
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you upset your
anonymity was broken?

22:48.668 --> 22:51.771
Because nobody judges you.
I mean,

22:51.804 --> 22:53.773
who would,
considering...
Considering what?

22:53.806 --> 22:55.708
You know, just,
what you've been through.

22:55.742 --> 22:56.676
Oh, you mean foster care?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.010
You think that's why

22:58.044 --> 22:59.746
I'm an alcoholic?
That is not
what I said.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.181
I was only acknowledging
the fact

23:02.214 --> 23:03.783
that, you know,
you-you've, you've been

23:03.816 --> 23:05.518
through a lot.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.720
But you know what?
I don't know, Clay.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.456
I don't know because
you're so damn bottled up,

23:09.489 --> 23:10.657
you won't tell me, so...

23:10.690 --> 23:12.158
Tell you what?

23:12.191 --> 23:14.794
About the late night
beatings from Daddy Dearest?

23:14.827 --> 23:15.862
Clay...
Or how about
the cigarettes

23:15.895 --> 23:17.864
that used to get
put out on my body?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.866
What do you want
to know exactly?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.100
Why didn't someone help you?

23:21.133 --> 23:22.835
Like, move you to a new family?

23:22.869 --> 23:25.505
This was the new family.

23:25.538 --> 23:28.708
I... I-I can't imagine
how you must feel.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.743
But...

23:30.777 --> 23:33.880
we're all as sick
as our secrets, Clay, and...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.181
we all need
someone to talk to.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.116
Even you.

23:37.149 --> 23:40.587
I'm just saying I'm-I'm here
for you if you need me.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.822
I know that, Ellie.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.826
(sighs)

23:52.164 --> 23:55.635
Well, that's odd.
Hmm?

23:57.670 --> 24:00.106
The Christmas decorations
are on top of the Easter box.

24:00.139 --> 24:03.643
The Easter box should've been
put away last.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.979
And why is the Christmas box
the only one taped shut?

24:11.684 --> 24:14.153
Probably because of this.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.956
I'll get it to Abby.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.908
Surprise.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.110
I just thought
I'd check in on you.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.980
I could use the company.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.589
Did you guys find
what you were looking for?

24:49.622 --> 24:51.057
Possibly.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.593
I got some good
news for you.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.028
We just got word back from the
Virginia state police captain.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.864
You're in the clear.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.932
Remember what
they say.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.735
Pain is a touchstone
for spiritual growth.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.271
If God brings you to it,
He will bring you through it.

25:05.304 --> 25:08.875
There is no chemical solution
for a spiritual problem.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.910
Just keep first things first...

25:10.943 --> 25:11.911
And this, too,

25:11.944 --> 25:13.813
shall pass.
(laughs)

25:13.846 --> 25:15.247
(chuckles)

25:15.281 --> 25:17.617
When I was new, all
these damn clichés

25:17.650 --> 25:19.285
would drive me crazy.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.821
Five years later,
they all make sense.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.222
You gonna be okay?

25:23.255 --> 25:25.925
Yeah, I think so.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.928
There's this meditation meeting
around the corner.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.630
If you want to go with.

25:30.663 --> 25:31.964
That's so sweet.

25:31.998 --> 25:32.965
(clicks tongue)

25:32.999 --> 25:34.734
Got to finish up these pies

25:34.767 --> 25:36.636
before the women's
meeting tonight.

25:36.669 --> 25:37.970
It's a potluck.

25:38.004 --> 25:38.971
What kind of pies?

25:39.005 --> 25:40.740
Chicken pot.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.275
It's my family's special recipe.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.644
The ladies love them.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.878
Not just the ladies.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.014
Us men have to eat, too,
you know.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.982
And nothing tastes
better than free food.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.884
You could stop by, if you want.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.654
For some reason,
I don't think

25:54.687 --> 25:55.888
the girls are gonna
kick you out.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.356
(both laugh)

25:57.389 --> 25:58.825
(sighs)

25:58.858 --> 26:01.060
Hang in there.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.864
BISHOP:
Holdren's drone is
dubbed "Airtime."

26:04.897 --> 26:07.066
But he'd obviously have
to be pretty stupid

26:07.099 --> 26:08.901
to not disguise the
name of the file.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.870
Well, when it comes
to stupidity,

26:10.903 --> 26:13.239
I would not
underestimate this guy.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.242
Yeah, Abby's right. This guy did
steal classified Navy material,

26:16.275 --> 26:18.010
and confessed to his
battered girlfriend.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.712
ABBY:
Keeping that in mind,

26:19.746 --> 26:22.915
where's the most obvious place
to hide a metadata file?

26:22.949 --> 26:24.951
The cache.
The cache.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.789
McGEE:
Well, this is definitely
the stolen ONI file,

26:29.822 --> 26:31.691
but where's the
schematics and software?

26:31.724 --> 26:32.992
There's only headers left.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.694
All the data's
been transferred.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.996
Well, let's hope Holdren
didn't have a chance to sell it.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.634
VANCE:
Clock's ticking, Gibbs.

26:41.668 --> 26:44.937
We need to recover the stolen
software while we still can.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.238
Running through all
of Holdren's contacts,

26:46.272 --> 26:48.007
building a list
of possible buyers.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.910
Situation's even worse
than the Navy led us to believe.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.679
I thought we were
all on the same side.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.013
The project is need-to-know

26:54.046 --> 26:56.015
because of the potential
implications.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.851
Navy's plan was for Airtime
to eventually replace

26:58.885 --> 27:00.920
their entire fleet of UAVs.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.189
If this intel lands
in the wrong hands,

27:03.222 --> 27:05.324
every drone
that's currently in the air

27:05.357 --> 27:06.926
will soon be grounded.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.129
It's really nice of them
to let us know.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.665
Since it's on us
to find the damn thing.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.343
BISHOP: Eddie may not
have had many friends,

27:24.376 --> 27:26.746
but he had a lot of associates.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.315
Several dozen had contact
with him just last week.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.482
Could any of them be,
uh, any possible buyers?

27:30.516 --> 27:33.119
Well, it's gonna take us time
to tick all these names

27:33.152 --> 27:35.021
off the list.
GIBBS:
Well, then stop wasting it.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.089
I need a lead now!

27:39.158 --> 27:40.893
What?

27:43.395 --> 27:44.797
Hello, folks.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.032
I had a thought.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.666
Permission to come aboard?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.739
So you're searching
for potential buyers

27:52.772 --> 27:54.206
by probing Eddie's cell phone

27:54.240 --> 27:55.407
and e-mail, correct?

27:55.441 --> 27:56.943
BISHOP: Along with
all his landline calls,

27:56.976 --> 27:58.477
credit card records
and online search history.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.046
That's a hell of a paper trail.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.048
And a whole lot of ground
to cover.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.916
Especially if you consider
that the best criminals

28:03.950 --> 28:05.918
don't leave trails.
McGEE: Eddie Holdren
hardly seems

28:05.952 --> 28:07.219
like a seasoned criminal.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.454
No.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.322
But anyone looking to buy

28:10.356 --> 28:13.292
stolen Navy software
probably is.

28:13.325 --> 28:16.328
Exactly. They'd make sure there
was nothing on Eddie's records

28:16.362 --> 28:18.164
that could lead us to them.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.866
Well, if we nix
Eddie's paper trail,

28:19.899 --> 28:21.467
then what do you suggest
we follow?

28:21.500 --> 28:23.269
His footprints.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.271
Not digital, but physical.

28:25.304 --> 28:28.407
We shift our focus
to his real life movements.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.309
I know who can help with that.
Melissa.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.278
Gibbs, I'm pretty sure
I know where I can find her.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.013
Yeah, let's go.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.050
(drawer closes)

28:39.385 --> 28:41.153
Hey, new game plan,
less paper cuts.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.856
You're welcome to the bullpen
anytime, Agent Sloane.

28:43.890 --> 28:44.891
You can call me Jack.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.158
Thanks, Nick.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.927
Oh, come on,
you got to be kidding me.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.361
Something wrong, McGee?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.764
You tell me.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.768
Oh, yeah.
Wow.

28:55.802 --> 28:56.936
Um, McGee got memed.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.171
He's a McMeme.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.807
That's really unfortunate.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.209
Well, he hasn't even
noticed the worst part.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.913
What?
60,000 more shares?

29:06.946 --> 29:09.048
(Torres laughs)
Welcome to NCIS.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.951
(both laugh)

29:11.984 --> 29:13.820
Especially what she
said at the end.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.988
Oh, when she said thanks, thank
you to all those nice people.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.223
I know.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.925
It was good.
I'm glad we came.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.893
Clay.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.061
Hey.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.396
What are you doing here?

29:24.430 --> 29:25.932
We came for the free food.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.299
Oh.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.935
I don't believe we've met.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.303
Special Agent Gibbs.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.372
I bet you are.
Oh, my God.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.941
Nancy, please.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.575
Okay, okay, I'm-I'm going.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.211
Lord, have mercy.

29:39.245 --> 29:42.014
(laughs)
That's so embarrassing.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.817
With her as my sponsor, it's
a miracle I've stayed sober.

29:44.851 --> 29:48.020
I took my 30-day chip last week.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.589
I know it doesn't probably sound
like such a big deal...

29:50.622 --> 29:51.991
It does to me.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.026
You doing a 30 in 30?

29:54.060 --> 29:55.995
30 meetings in 30 days?

29:56.028 --> 29:58.931
Sponsor's orders.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.433
Are you in the program,
Agent Gibbs?

30:01.467 --> 30:03.569
No. No, a friend.

30:03.602 --> 30:07.940
Well, I know you didn't come
all this way to bum a free meal.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.108
How can I help you?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.977
Did you notice any changes

30:11.010 --> 30:13.045
in Eddie's routine recently?

30:13.079 --> 30:18.317
No. He was always either
at home with me or at work.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.852
Are you sure?

30:19.886 --> 30:21.020
There was one night,
a couple weeks ago,

30:21.053 --> 30:23.355
he was acting kind of strange.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.457
Strange how?
I caught him
sneaking out

30:25.491 --> 30:27.126
in the middle of the night.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.861
He said he had to go
back to the office

30:28.895 --> 30:32.031
to catch up on some work, but...

30:32.064 --> 30:33.199
You didn't believe him?

30:33.232 --> 30:35.968
I wasn't sure what to believe.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.436
The thought even crossed my mind

30:37.469 --> 30:40.006
that he might've been
cheating on me.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.942
Especially since his phone
was turned off.

30:47.646 --> 30:48.614
Okay. Anything?

30:48.647 --> 30:50.049
Nope, not yet.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.283
Are you sure
extracting these locations

30:51.317 --> 30:53.052
is even possible, Abby?

30:53.085 --> 30:54.853
Have a little faith, Reeves.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.924
Aha! Ha!

30:57.957 --> 30:59.258
Not my first day.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.626
And we're lucky
that Eddie Holdren's

31:00.659 --> 31:02.428
ride came equipped
with EDR.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.430
Event Data Recorder.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.966
This baby recorded everywhere
the car went.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.534
It's a comprehensive,
time-stamped

31:08.567 --> 31:11.537
log of all of his travels.
REEVES: Punch up

31:11.570 --> 31:13.105
all his destinations
from two weeks ago.

31:13.139 --> 31:14.373
McGEE:
Two minutes, three tops.

31:14.406 --> 31:18.444
Hey, uh, did either of you know
Gibbs has a friend in recovery?

31:18.477 --> 31:19.478
Gibbs has friends?

31:19.511 --> 31:21.147
Well, at least one.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.648
Must be a close mate, too.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.016
'Cause Gibbs
was well-versed.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.117
He even knows the lingo.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.652
Well, did he say who it is?

31:27.653 --> 31:29.621
Right, anonymous.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.590
Okay, eyes on
the prize, McGee.

31:31.623 --> 31:34.293
You're moving slower
than a herd full of snails

31:34.326 --> 31:36.162
traveling through peanut butter.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.164
Okay, let me just bypass
this final

31:38.197 --> 31:40.099
finicky little firewall,
and there we go.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.567
REEVES: Nice work.
Can you confine

31:41.600 --> 31:43.502
the search to show
only trips made between

31:43.535 --> 31:45.137
midnight and 5:00 a.m.?

31:45.171 --> 31:47.106
McGEE:
Only one.

31:47.139 --> 31:51.343
Two Saturdays ago, he drove to
976 Rosewood Drive at 2:17 a.m.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.678
It's in Alexandria.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.313
ABBY:
Four Score Café?

31:54.346 --> 31:56.348
The food can't be so good that
he's driving all the way

31:56.382 --> 31:58.117
across town
in the middle of the night.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.586
Maybe it was a late-night
meeting with his buyer.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.055
Let's see if there's
video surveillance.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.129
REEVES: Surprised how many
people are still coming in

32:10.162 --> 32:11.397
after 2:00 a.m.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.099
Sunday morning.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.366
Bars just closed.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.102
Can't go to the after-party

32:16.135 --> 32:17.970
without getting yourself
some chicken and waffles.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.206
That's just irresponsible, man.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.408
McGEE: Well, there's our
boy Eddie, right on time.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.076
TORRES:
Why is he not going in?

32:24.110 --> 32:25.377
He's waiting on the buyer.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.249
McGEE: Wait, that's Nancy,
Melissa's sponsor.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.385
TORRES:
What is Nancy doing

32:33.419 --> 32:35.187
meeting Eddie at
2:00 in the morning?

32:36.588 --> 32:38.290
Good question.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.726
What's this all about?

32:40.759 --> 32:42.361
The software you helped steal.

32:42.394 --> 32:45.064
It belongs to the Navy.
They'd like it back.

32:45.097 --> 32:48.500
I've never stolen anything
in my life.

32:48.534 --> 32:51.003
Call Melissa, she'll tell you
how ridiculous this is.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.271
You sure you want us to do that?

32:52.304 --> 32:53.639
'Cause if we call her,

32:53.672 --> 32:55.207
we're gonna have to tell her
about your

32:55.241 --> 32:56.508
late-night rendezvous
with Eddie.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.245
Eddie? Melissa's boyfriend?

32:59.278 --> 33:01.380
I would never do that.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.283
She's my sponsee.
That relationship is sacred.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.286
Besides,
I've never even met Eddie.

33:09.188 --> 33:14.460
Well, I'd say Melissa
needs a new sponsor.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.561
Well, why is that?

33:15.594 --> 33:18.030
Last I checked, sponsors are
still allowed to date.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.231
You said you and Eddie
never met.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.499
Because we haven't.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.501
That's you with Eddie.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.236
Melissa's boyfriend.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.805
No, this is me with Austin.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.674
My boyfriend.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.177
We met on an online dating site
a couple months ago.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.145
(clears throat)

33:37.249 --> 33:38.450
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.693
Does Melissa know?

33:59.738 --> 34:01.540
(sighs)

34:03.409 --> 34:04.576
Palmer, you called me.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.478
Yeah, like,
15 minutes ago.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.647
Could've been less.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.416
Uh, not that there's
a specific amount of time

34:10.449 --> 34:12.351
for you to respond when I call
with something urgent.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.385
But...
Do you got something?

34:13.419 --> 34:14.386
God, I hope so.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.555
Uh, Abby and I revisited
Holdren's test results.

34:16.588 --> 34:19.258
We found that the oxycodone
had metabolized

34:19.291 --> 34:20.859
in an abnormal fashion.
Abnormal how?

34:20.892 --> 34:21.960
Well, the drug's
chemical compound

34:21.993 --> 34:24.696
had already been altered
prior to coming into contact

34:24.730 --> 34:26.765
with the hydrochloric acid
in his stomach.

34:26.798 --> 34:28.767
So, after further testing,
Abby and I concluded

34:28.800 --> 34:32.838
that the oxycodone had been
altered by a very specific acid

34:32.871 --> 34:35.141
typically found
in cayenne pepper.

34:35.174 --> 34:39.778
So, Eddie either mixed the drug
with his own food or...

34:39.811 --> 34:41.113
He was drugged.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.581
McGEE:
Drugged by who?

34:42.614 --> 34:43.815
Melissa?

34:43.849 --> 34:45.151
I mean, she...

34:45.184 --> 34:46.652
she was the only one
that was with him.

34:46.685 --> 34:47.753
She said so herself.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.455
Yeah, it's difficult
to drug someone

34:49.488 --> 34:50.756
when you've got a gun
pointed to your head.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.459
Besides,
I watched Eddie kidnap her.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.361
No, you saw
someone kidnap her.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.496
Don't tell me you believe
this rubbish, too, McGee?

34:57.529 --> 34:58.797
TORRES:
Hey, listen,

34:58.830 --> 34:59.865
I understand that
she's your friend,

34:59.898 --> 35:00.866
all right,
but this is a theory.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.302
It's not rubbish.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.436
Stop arguing.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.471
Start digging.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.805
I didn't know we stopped.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.808
I completed my profile
on Eddie Holdren.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.877
To my surprise,
there was no evidence

35:11.910 --> 35:13.312
of trauma in his adolescence.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.780
No history of abuse.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.782
Prior to Melissa, his
relationships with women

35:16.815 --> 35:19.618
were not only cordial,
but loving.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.687
I actually spoke to
his college girlfriend,

35:21.720 --> 35:23.889
who refused to believe that
Eddie would ever be capable

35:23.922 --> 35:25.157
of violence against anyone.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.925
People change.
SLOANE: True,

35:26.958 --> 35:29.495
but a radical shift in psyche
almost always occurs

35:29.528 --> 35:33.165
as the result of a traumatic
event in one's formative years.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.633
Holdren had none.
Doesn't mean

35:34.666 --> 35:36.235
he's not the monster
Melissa says.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.603
It's possible...

35:37.636 --> 35:39.205
but not probable.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.473
When we factor in the
credibility of our source,

35:41.507 --> 35:44.276
everything we've been told
about Eddie and his temper

35:44.310 --> 35:46.645
comes from the same person,
Melissa Goodman.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.447
You saying she's a liar, yeah?

35:48.480 --> 35:49.915
SLOANE:
When my profile on Eddie

35:49.948 --> 35:52.318
didn't match the picture
that Melissa painted,

35:52.351 --> 35:54.953
I focused my attention on her
and I'm sorry to say, Reeves,

35:54.986 --> 35:58.190
what I found was
a cunning, vindictive

35:58.224 --> 35:59.191
narcissist.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.892
She checked all the boxes

36:00.926 --> 36:03.395
for antisocial personality
disorder, Gibbs.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.596
She also had motive.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.432
She found out that Eddie
was cheating on her.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.400
And this would've been
her chance to get revenge on him

36:08.434 --> 36:09.835
and make a small fortune
doing it.

36:09.868 --> 36:10.969
Yeah, by stealing intel
from Eddie's laptop

36:11.002 --> 36:12.571
and selling it
to the highest bidder.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.841
All theory, no real
evidence here.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.277
Yeah, Bishop.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.478
Yeah.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.980
I'll be right up.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.950
Melissa Goodman.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.653
I want to know everything
there is about her.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.221
Keep digging.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.956
Found the laptop,
but the design plans

36:30.989 --> 36:34.593
and operating system data
for Airtime were removed.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.895
I can't believe how far
this has gone.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.597
With Holdren going missing

36:38.630 --> 36:41.867
to being accused of kidnapping
and then turning up dead.

36:41.900 --> 36:42.868
Captain Redding.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.403
Gibbs.
What do we have?

36:44.436 --> 36:45.504
Picked up chatter
on the Dark Web.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.607
Airtime is being put up for sale
to the highest bidder.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.877
With Holdren dead,
then who's doing this?

36:51.910 --> 36:52.911
I think we may have an idea.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.546
We do?

36:54.580 --> 36:55.947
Yeah, Dark Web.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.383
How do we know
they really have it?

36:57.416 --> 36:59.285
They offered a preview,
a few lines of coding.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.686
We analyzed it.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.388
Unfortunately, it's ours.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.258
Torres, I got
something here.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.993
Oh, good, 'cause I got nothing.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.262
The day before Melissa Goodman
was abducted,

37:10.296 --> 37:12.264
she transferred $10,000
to an Andrew Lewis.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.265
Ten grand?

37:13.299 --> 37:14.733
That's interesting.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.635
What's really interesting
is when I tracked his address

37:16.668 --> 37:17.903
through his bank account,

37:17.936 --> 37:20.272
he lives in the same building
as Melissa.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.106
TORRES:
Really?

37:21.139 --> 37:22.774
Why are you looking
at that twit?

37:23.909 --> 37:25.010
What, you know him?
Yeah,

37:25.043 --> 37:27.746
that's the manager of
Melissa's apartment building.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.748
He was snooping around when
Bishop and I was having a look.

37:29.781 --> 37:30.982
Why would she give him
ten grand?

37:31.016 --> 37:33.385
Who knows? Maybe she was
prepaying her rent.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.686
Come on, Reeves.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.987
McGEE: Jimmy, hey,
you got something?
JIMMY: Yes.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.490
I just catalogued
Eddie Holdren's stomach content

37:38.524 --> 37:40.326
and found out what dish the
cayenne pepper was sprinkled on

37:40.359 --> 37:41.460
to drug him...

37:41.493 --> 37:43.395
His last meal:
chicken pot pie.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.263
REEVES:
Pot pies.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.499
Something we should know,
Reeves?

38:00.979 --> 38:03.081
Hey.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.917
No, I'm still waiting
for the buyer.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.386
I'll call you back in a few.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.387
Okay.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.988
(beeps)

38:11.990 --> 38:13.325
Hello, Melissa.

38:13.359 --> 38:14.693
Clay.
(chuckles nervously)

38:14.726 --> 38:15.961
What a surprise.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.430
What are you, uh,
waiting on a date?

38:18.464 --> 38:22.501
No, no, God,
it's way too soon for that.

38:22.534 --> 38:25.837
I, uh, waiting for a friend
for dinner.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.574
Might as well keep each other
company while we wait, eh?

38:28.607 --> 38:30.542
(chuckles)

38:31.910 --> 38:34.413
(sighs)

38:34.446 --> 38:35.814
Something wrong?

38:35.847 --> 38:36.982
No, of course not.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.988
Would you excuse me for a second
while I make a phone call?

38:43.021 --> 38:44.122
Sure.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.358
(dialing)

38:49.895 --> 38:52.398
(phone ringing)

38:54.165 --> 38:55.834
Hello, Melissa.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.969
Calling your buyer?

39:00.739 --> 39:02.874
You set me up?

39:02.908 --> 39:05.076
Please,

39:05.110 --> 39:07.713
take a seat.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.548
I said sit down!

39:18.757 --> 39:21.126
We know you transferred ten
grand to your building manager's

39:21.159 --> 39:24.129
checking account the day before
you were supposably kidnapped.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.498
You paid him
to fake the kidnapping.

39:26.532 --> 39:27.799
In fact,

39:27.833 --> 39:30.135
you've been
faking a lot of things.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.139
(sniffs)

39:35.941 --> 39:37.142
Whiskey and Coke.

39:37.175 --> 39:40.145
You didn't come
into the program for help.

39:40.178 --> 39:41.813
You joined because you found out

39:41.847 --> 39:43.549
your boyfriend
was cheating on you.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.885
He got what he deserved.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.720
You asked Nancy
to be your sponsor

39:48.754 --> 39:50.589
because you found out
she was the other woman.

39:50.622 --> 39:54.426
And you targeted me
for your insurance policy.

39:54.460 --> 39:57.863
Who better to corroborate
your story than a fed?

39:57.896 --> 40:00.899
See, I was your key witness.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.738
(sighs) And now
I'm your worst nightmare.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.778
On your feet.
Let's go.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.213
Hey, you want a to-go cup
for that cocktail?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.615
Liquor is not
quite the same

40:16.648 --> 40:17.883
where we're taking you.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.985
Probably because they
make it in a toilet.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.637
TORRES: Still trying to
figure out who memed you, bud?

40:38.670 --> 40:40.972
Nope. Put all my
hacking skills to work,

40:41.006 --> 40:43.041
and I am proud to say,
I now know exactly

40:43.074 --> 40:44.543
who it was.

40:44.576 --> 40:45.711
BISHOP: Torres.
What?

40:45.744 --> 40:47.513
I didn't even know
what a meme was

40:47.546 --> 40:49.948
until McGee's extremely
humiliating experience.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.182
No, it wasn't Torres.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.719
Not unless he posted it from
the Bastille quarter in Paris

40:53.752 --> 40:54.720
earlier this week.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.254
Ol' Paree, huh?

40:56.287 --> 40:57.656
Mysterious.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.558
Hey, who memed you, buddy?

40:59.591 --> 41:02.127
Someone who is about to be
very, very sorry.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.095
'Cause when you mess
with the bull...

41:04.996 --> 41:07.198
...you get the horns.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.136
Oh... my God.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.672
Tony?

41:15.206 --> 41:17.275
TORRES:
Who's Tony?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.244
An old friend.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.246
TORRES:
What, you were friends

41:21.279 --> 41:23.214
with the bass player
from Flock of Seagulls?

41:24.883 --> 41:26.752
(whistles)

41:26.785 --> 41:30.221
Got a lot to catch up on, Gibbs.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.997
MAN:
So, I sat down last night

41:39.030 --> 41:41.066
and wrote a thorough inventory
for the first time

41:41.099 --> 41:42.734
since I was a newcomer, and,

41:42.768 --> 41:45.604
(laughs):
I got to tell you, I mean...

41:47.172 --> 41:48.273
Rachel?

41:48.306 --> 41:49.841
REEVES:
Clay.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.945
Alcoholic.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.684
(sighs)

42:06.625 --> 42:10.028
I've been coming
to this meeting for months.

42:10.061 --> 42:13.799
All you know about
me is my name.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.902
And my disease.

42:18.303 --> 42:20.305
A good friend recently told me

42:20.338 --> 42:23.809
that we're as sick
as our secrets.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.011
And I think she's right.

42:29.615 --> 42:33.819
And I'm sick of paying
for other people's sins.

42:36.254 --> 42:41.259
My name is Clayton Dante Reeves.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.263
And I have a story to tell.
