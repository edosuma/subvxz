WEBVTT

07:47.968 --> 07:49.067
Yes?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.502
Hi, Hailey.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.137
Ben.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.339
You remembered.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.075
To be honest, I didn't
think you would.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.510
I'd say welcome back

07:58.512 --> 08:01.146
but that would imply that I
give a shit about this place.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.918
It's good to see
you, you look good.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.287
So do you.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.155
Oh.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.059
Sorry about your dad.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.329
What are you doing here?

08:17.331 --> 08:19.297
I thought I saw you earlier.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.932
Couldn't believe it.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.601
I had to come see for myself.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.603
I wasn't sure if
it was really you.

08:27.774 --> 08:31.376
Do you wanna let me in? We
can catch up like old friends.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.750
It's quite a collection.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.689
Yeah.

08:52.666 --> 08:56.735
You never really
liked me, did you?

08:58.372 --> 08:59.237
What?

09:00.507 --> 09:01.573
Come on.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.843
Think I didn't notice
the look on your face?

09:04.845 --> 09:07.746
I wasn't
expecting a drop-in.

09:08.582 --> 09:11.416
No, that's not it.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.387
It's okay, you can tell me.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.625
You were mean.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.627
What?

09:23.730 --> 09:26.665
You were mean to me.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.099
You pushed me, teased me.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.904
I don't quite
remember it that way.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.773
You threw rocks at me

09:34.775 --> 09:36.608
when we go swimming in the lake.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.078
Shit.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.415
I forgot about that.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.020
Ouch.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.825
Did that hurt?

09:56.730 --> 09:57.596
Yeah.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.468
I'm sorry.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.170
I'll live.

10:10.544 --> 10:11.710
What about that one?

10:12.779 --> 10:13.912
No.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.547
No, that one wasn't you.

10:15.549 --> 10:16.615
Oh.

10:23.757 --> 10:24.723
I was bored, okay?

10:25.592 --> 10:26.691
A lot.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.761
Growing up, there
wasn't much to do

10:29.763 --> 10:31.730
when you live in the
middle of nowhere.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.600
Gotta entertain
yourself somehow.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.401
Yeah.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.804
I just didn't wanna see people.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.140
What do you mean?

10:43.310 --> 10:46.745
I didn't want
anyone, you know,

10:46.747 --> 10:48.780
hugging me or crying on me

10:48.782 --> 10:51.016
or telling me their
deepest condolences.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.417
It's just better that way.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.721
Yeah, you mean easier?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.692
Yeah.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.129
I guess.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.764
I guess it doesn't
matter anyway.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.564
I'm not staying.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.034
No?

11:09.936 --> 11:11.503
No.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.438
It's a long way
to come for nothing.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.607
He's my father.

11:15.609 --> 11:16.741
Yeah, was.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.680
To our fathers.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.290
How do you drink that stuff?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.758
It was his favorite.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.194
He kept it hidden
in his dresser.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.296
You get used to the taste.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.898
That's not a very
good hiding spot.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.300
My dad used to hide
his in an old toolbox.

11:43.670 --> 11:44.636
He wasn't hiding it.

11:44.638 --> 11:45.737
I knew exactly where it was.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.908
Why'd he hide it, then?

11:53.513 --> 11:54.913
He trusted me.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.416
Do you miss him?

12:03.824 --> 12:04.656
Of course.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.759
If your dad died,
wouldn't you miss him?

12:09.229 --> 12:13.098
Ah, fortunately my
dad is alive and well.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.333
Right.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.002
That's a good
thing, that's good.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.106
We are having a dinner tonight

12:21.108 --> 12:22.874
for Tressa's birthday.

12:22.876 --> 12:26.077
Yeah, we still celebrate
it every year, you know.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.948
Dinner, cake, the usual.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.350
Yeah, I remember.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.152
We'd like it if
you could join us.

12:36.723 --> 12:40.258
I just got in, so I...

12:40.260 --> 12:43.294
Yeah well it would be
just like you remember.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.765
You remember, it'd be you, me,

12:46.767 --> 12:47.999
my dad, your dad.

12:48.902 --> 12:49.834
He never missed it.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.972
I can't imagine he would.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.039
Yeah, not one year.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.809
You know, even after you left.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.378
He'd even pick up the cake.

13:01.948 --> 13:02.881
Sounds like him.

13:03.717 --> 13:04.816
Yeah.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.820
And it would mean a lot
to my dad, you know.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.822
He'd like to keep
the tradition going.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.725
And since your dad,
he can't make it,

13:13.727 --> 13:15.560
it would mean a
lot if you would.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.764
Specially since you're back,

13:19.766 --> 13:20.799
however long that is.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.837
He's probably cooking
up the fish as we speak.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.340
Yeah.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.342
Yeah, it's okay.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.411
I don't really like fish either.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.213
But all you gotta do is smile,

13:36.416 --> 13:38.082
pretend like you're
having a good time.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.388
Can you do that, Hailey?

15:24.190 --> 15:25.189
Smells good.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.090
Yeah.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.725
Dad doesn't cook much anymore

15:27.727 --> 15:29.861
but he hasn't lost his touch.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.601
That one's mine.

15:38.972 --> 15:42.006
I won it at the
Summer Catch of '97.

15:42.876 --> 15:46.110
I was the only kid under
18 that won a prize.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.046
Yeah.

15:49.783 --> 15:50.949
It was a good summer.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.084
I've never been.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.018
To the Summer Catch?

15:55.322 --> 15:56.788
No, fishing.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.123
Oh.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.661
Yeah, we did it all the time.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.595
If you didn't catch it,

16:04.597 --> 16:05.797
You don't eat it.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.133
It's an old family motto.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.803
I haven't used it since,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.540
well, not for a while now.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.345
It's good to see you again.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.646
It's been a long time.

16:23.850 --> 16:24.983
My deepest condolences.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.187
As you know, your dad
and I were very close.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.198
Glad you could join us.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.467
Tonight is very special.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.105
Thanks for inviting me.

16:48.942 --> 16:50.174
You didn't have to do that.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.978
What kind of neighbors
would we be if we didn't?

16:53.980 --> 16:56.014
Besides, you used to
be a regular here.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.017
I'm sure we'll have
lots to talk about.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.488
Well, that dinner's not
gonna finish itself.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.822
Can I help with dinner?

17:04.824 --> 17:07.225
No, thank you, but
I've got it covered.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.693
Benny'll keep you company.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.029
Take her jacket for her too.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.564
You want me to roll
out a red carpet for her

17:13.566 --> 17:14.432
while I'm at it?

17:19.506 --> 17:20.705
Forgive him, Hailey.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.241
We don't entertain much.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.510
Ben forgets how to act

17:25.512 --> 17:26.978
when there's company around.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.527
Hailey.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.230
Hailey!

18:19.232 --> 18:20.598
What?

18:20.600 --> 18:21.466
You okay?

18:22.902 --> 18:24.135
Yeah.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.237
Are you sure?

18:26.239 --> 18:27.972
You got the deer in
the headlights look.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.141
Yeah, yeah.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.043
No, I'm good.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.958
I need a cigarette.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.161
Where's my jacket?

18:50.163 --> 18:51.129
In the closet.

18:51.998 --> 18:52.897
Right.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.346
You hear that?

19:08.348 --> 19:09.847
Yeah.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.816
Good, then do something
about it, will ya?

19:21.127 --> 19:23.194
And don't let her leave.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.175
Hi.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.210
Hi, it's okay.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.546
It's okay.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.350
Hi.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.619
Hi, buddy.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.590
It's okay.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.195
It's okay, come here.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.597
Come on.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.270
Hi.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.540
It's okay.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.277
Come on, I'm not gonna hurt you.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.546
Come on.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.647
You like dogs?

20:19.185 --> 20:22.253
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.490
Don't be.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.627
Looks like he likes you.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.629
He doesn't like anyone.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.265
Even you?

20:37.237 --> 20:41.205
Do you always
keep him in a cage?

20:41.207 --> 20:42.273
Yeah, more or less.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.343
I mean, that's why
he doesn't like you.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.348
Can I bum a drag?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.325
I don't remember
you having a dog.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.461
We didn't.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.631
My dad got him a few years back,

21:06.633 --> 21:08.199
thought it'd be a good idea.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.468
For what?

21:11.471 --> 21:12.803
I don't know.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.439
Didn't work anyway.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.041
It just became my problem.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.013
- I had a dog once.
- Hey.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.349
It didn't go very well.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.985
He had two white front paws

21:27.987 --> 21:29.220
and I called him Socks.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.222
- Socks?
- Mhmm.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.327
That's when I was like 11, so.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.864
What happened to him?

21:41.601 --> 21:42.900
I don't know.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.971
Woke up one morning and

21:51.344 --> 21:52.242
he was gone.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.143
Dogs run off,
it's what they do.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.513
Yeah.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.418
Why do you think we
keep him in a cage?

22:08.995 --> 22:09.860
Dinner's ready.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.274
Thank you.

22:23.276 --> 22:24.208
Looks good.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.277
It was her favorite.

22:28.281 --> 22:31.349
Not fancy, but it'll
get the job done.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.284
Yeah, he says that every year.

22:33.286 --> 22:34.185
Yeah, probably.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.192
You know, nothing
brings me more joy

22:41.194 --> 22:43.527
than to see you sitting
here tonight, Hailey.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.763
Just as it used to be.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.266
So what have you been up to?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.436
How are you handling it
without your old man?

22:55.308 --> 22:56.407
Okay, I guess.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.480
I keep thinking that I'll
see him standing there

23:02.482 --> 23:03.981
every time I walk into a room.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.469
That's natural.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.421
Unfortunately, it
never really goes away.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.033
Tressa really liked
you, you know?

23:23.035 --> 23:25.202
She used to braid my hair

23:25.204 --> 23:26.904
and taught me how to do it.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.007
She was really nice to me.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.709
Yeah, she was
nice to everyone.

23:31.711 --> 23:32.576
Still.

23:39.452 --> 23:42.620
I guess you're probably
pretty happy to be home?

23:42.622 --> 23:44.121
How many years has it been?

23:45.925 --> 23:48.025
I don't know,
maybe seven or eight?

23:48.861 --> 23:49.693
Hmm.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.598
What?

23:55.535 --> 23:56.634
Nothing, it's just,

23:58.237 --> 23:59.303
where does time go?

24:11.584 --> 24:15.219
My star will find her way home.

24:15.955 --> 24:16.821
What?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.660
Something your
dad used to say.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.397
That's what he
called you, isn't it?

24:28.568 --> 24:29.400
Yeah.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.170
I didn't
believe him, but he knew.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.038
He always knew.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.478
I'm sure you made
him very happy.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.882
You look a lot like
him too, you know.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.586
Same misshapen knuckles
and everything.

24:50.690 --> 24:54.325
Then again, I've
actually never seen

24:54.327 --> 24:55.526
photos of your mother.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.395
Neither have I.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.673
Eat something.

25:10.510 --> 25:11.709
Before it gets cold.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.784
So what have you been up to?

25:20.786 --> 25:22.553
You must have a lot
of stories to share.

25:22.555 --> 25:23.687
No, not really.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.790
It's boring.

25:27.793 --> 25:29.426
I own an apartment.

25:31.297 --> 25:35.799
It's small and it's
nice but it's mine.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.468
And I found a job
that people are nice.

25:37.470 --> 25:38.969
Oh, that's good.

25:38.971 --> 25:39.803
Yeah.

25:42.475 --> 25:44.108
You have a lot of trophies.

25:47.513 --> 25:48.612
Fishing's in our blood.

25:50.516 --> 25:51.715
Most of them are Tressa's.

25:52.552 --> 25:53.751
I have a few.

25:54.987 --> 25:55.819
Ben has one.

25:55.821 --> 25:56.654
Four.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.326
Me and your dad, we
fished quite a bit.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.564
He was a very patient man.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.067
Very patient.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.439
Never leaving until
he caught something.

26:17.510 --> 26:18.943
Just staring at the line.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.614
Never taking his eyes off it.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.791
I didn't know that.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.327
You didn't know what,

26:37.697 --> 26:39.496
that your dad was patient
or that he fished?

26:41.634 --> 26:42.700
Either.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.034
We didn't really
keep in touch, so.

26:46.539 --> 26:49.607
We spent almost every
weekend out there.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.576
We'd catch 'em and
Benny would gut 'em.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.644
Yeah.

26:53.646 --> 26:54.845
I got pretty good too.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.315
Ben looks at
gutting as an artform.

26:59.919 --> 27:04.188
But it's fishing itself,
that's the real art.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.726
Any fisherman worth his
salt will tell you that.

27:10.596 --> 27:11.629
Tressa was very good.

27:13.666 --> 27:14.898
Oh Lord, was she ever.

27:16.602 --> 27:17.901
Just like her grandfather.

27:23.442 --> 27:24.775
We'd spend hours out
there, just me and her.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.749
Even on the days that we'd
come back with nothing were

27:34.320 --> 27:36.220
still some of the
best days I've had.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.860
Sounds like you
were really close.

28:12.792 --> 28:13.757
Not today.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.067
Ben.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.406
Don't worry.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.641
Wouldn't wanna ruin it.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.745
- So how long are you-
- I have a question.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.915
What was it like growing
up in that house?

28:39.719 --> 28:40.651
What?

28:40.653 --> 28:41.885
Your house.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.354
I'm just curious.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.222
Ben!

28:46.092 --> 28:46.957
What?

28:48.427 --> 28:49.760
You're being impolite.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.730
No, I'm just
talking to Hailey.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.400
Why would you ask me that?

28:56.402 --> 28:57.901
I'm just making conversation.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.471
Why don't you get some air?

29:02.775 --> 29:04.074
It's freezing out.

29:04.777 --> 29:05.843
It'll do you good.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.126
Ben's a little
touchy these days.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.762
Specially on Tressa's birthday.

29:32.271 --> 29:32.970
You don't like carrots?

29:36.542 --> 29:37.841
I'm just not quite hungry.

29:39.612 --> 29:42.780
It's probably
not what you were expecting.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.815
I wasn't expecting anything.

29:44.817 --> 29:45.916
Mmm.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.284
Somehow I doubt that.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.460
Could I use your restroom?

29:57.830 --> 29:58.729
Sure.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.598
I'll check on Ben,

30:01.600 --> 30:03.700
make sure he hasn't
wandered off too far.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.737
Does he do that?

30:06.739 --> 30:07.838
He likes the woods.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.042
It's still down the
hall on the right.

31:41.734 --> 31:42.966
What are you doing in here?

31:45.838 --> 31:48.138
I was looking
for the restroom.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.108
It's not in here.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.914
I don't like people
in here, Hailey.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.385
Did you touch anything?

32:01.387 --> 32:02.486
Of course not, I...

32:12.464 --> 32:15.532
She was really pretty.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.000
Yeah, she was.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.270
Let me show you to the restroom.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.373
Okay.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.483
There you go.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.518
Thanks.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.814
Where are you going?

34:10.816 --> 34:12.382
I was just gonna
go check on Ben.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.084
Well that's
very nice of you.

34:14.086 --> 34:15.819
- Yeah, I'll just be a second.
- Hold on.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.255
There's no need.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.057
He's fine.

34:20.993 --> 34:22.059
Just needs to cool off.

34:23.529 --> 34:24.327
Right.

34:26.432 --> 34:28.165
We still have chocolate cake.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.168
You like chocolate
cake, don't you?

34:32.771 --> 34:33.570
Yeah.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.139
Well, speak of the devil.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.779
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.347
I got a little carried away.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.283
All is forgiven.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.251
Right, Hailey?

34:50.189 --> 34:51.288
Right.

34:52.424 --> 34:56.259
Benny, escort Hailey
back to the table.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.763
We'd hate for her
to get lost again.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.371
After you.

36:00.859 --> 36:05.929
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

36:07.799 --> 36:11.268
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

36:20.145 --> 36:25.215
♪ Happy birthday ♪

36:26.885 --> 36:29.352
♪ Dear Tressa ♪

36:43.202 --> 36:46.703
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

36:55.247 --> 36:56.112
Benny.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.415
Get Hailey another bottle.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.184
This one's looking
a little worn out.

37:01.186 --> 37:02.085
I'm actually good,

37:02.087 --> 37:03.520
- thanks.
- Nonsense.

37:03.522 --> 37:07.157
Besides, you're gonna want
a cold one for the toast.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.600
It's been a few years
since you've been back.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.303
Your father must be honored

37:53.305 --> 37:56.106
that you're carrying
on this tradition.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.528
Tradition?

38:02.530 --> 38:03.613
Celebrating her
memory, of course.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.985
After all, it was his idea.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.994
There's not a day that goes by

38:17.996 --> 38:19.462
when I don't think of you.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.534
There's not a moment that passes

38:27.239 --> 38:28.805
where I don't wonder
what kind of a person

38:28.807 --> 38:30.006
you would have become.

38:32.311 --> 38:35.879
What kind of life
you would have had.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.751
You were my everything.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.358
My whole world.

39:26.198 --> 39:27.430
You believe in God, Hailey?

39:34.039 --> 39:35.772
I bought a hammer
a few weeks back

39:37.309 --> 39:39.242
from that hardware store.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.745
The one that sells ties
in a box for a dollar.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.316
I wasn't in there for
any particular reason.

39:46.318 --> 39:47.484
I just wanted to look.

39:50.322 --> 39:52.322
I found myself in aisle three,

39:53.058 --> 39:54.124
staring at this one.

39:57.195 --> 39:58.061
A claw hammer.

40:00.432 --> 40:01.765
I don't know why I chose it.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.501
There were several
hammers to choose from.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.504
Call me crazy, but,

40:10.108 --> 40:12.075
I felt like it was
staring back at me.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.814
I started to fantasize

40:19.851 --> 40:21.918
about all the things
I could do with it.

40:25.457 --> 40:26.656
It was light, durable.

40:30.228 --> 40:30.894
Solid.

40:34.099 --> 40:34.931
Perfect.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.908
You know, losing a child is like

40:48.747 --> 40:49.762
losing a limb.

40:49.764 --> 40:50.780
You never quite
function the same again.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.822
And when a father
stops believing in God,

41:01.226 --> 41:03.026
there's no telling
what he might do.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.064
What's happening?

41:11.403 --> 41:12.502
What's happening?

41:14.840 --> 41:15.705
What?

41:17.576 --> 41:18.408
What did?

41:22.747 --> 41:26.149
What did you do?

41:27.252 --> 41:28.084
Ketamine.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.187
A powerful tranquilizer.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.189
They say it's used
to take down horses.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.459
I don't know how
much he gave you.

41:36.461 --> 41:39.395
Ben isn't exactly a chemist
when it comes to measurements.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.033
It's probably not
a pleasant feeling.

41:46.137 --> 41:49.539
Right now, you're losing
all motor function ability.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.575
Your heart rate is increasing

41:53.678 --> 41:54.711
which is only making
the experience

41:54.713 --> 41:55.912
all that much worse.

41:58.450 --> 41:59.549
No sense fighting it.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.538
Thanks for coming, Hailey.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.376
I'm sure Tressa appreciates it.

42:59.544 --> 43:00.710
Hey, you know where to go?

43:00.712 --> 43:01.945
Yeah, I know a place.

43:01.947 --> 43:04.113
Make sure it's
far enough away.

43:04.115 --> 43:07.183
Don't be messing around
out there, you hear me?

43:07.185 --> 43:08.518
Hey, you hear me?!

43:08.520 --> 43:09.452
Jesus!

43:09.454 --> 43:10.587
I hear you!

43:13.725 --> 43:15.224
What about her car?

43:15.226 --> 43:18.027
We'll take care
of that when you get back.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.462
Be back in an hour.

43:19.464 --> 43:20.563
Mhmm.

43:20.565 --> 43:22.465
I'm saving those
dishes for you too.

44:04.843 --> 44:07.677
You sing songs?

44:10.115 --> 44:12.815
Oh, Tressa and I, we'd always
sing in the car together

44:12.817 --> 44:14.851
on family road trips.

44:18.823 --> 44:21.924
We'd do it real loud
to piss off our dad.

44:26.965 --> 44:30.533
I bet you're real
pissed at me right now.

44:31.469 --> 44:32.402
I don't blame you.

44:38.677 --> 44:40.743
I just want you to know,

44:42.681 --> 44:44.013
it wasn't my idea, okay?

44:47.485 --> 44:49.118
I like you, Hailey.

44:50.855 --> 44:51.721
I really do.

44:56.728 --> 45:00.430
I'm sure we would have
been great friends.

45:01.733 --> 45:03.533
But it's a family thing.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.040
You know I never
liked my sister?

45:13.978 --> 45:15.278
Yeah I loved her and everything.

45:18.883 --> 45:20.717
She was always dad's favorite.

45:24.055 --> 45:24.921
Even now.

45:30.829 --> 45:33.229
I know he wishes it was me.

45:37.869 --> 45:39.936
Hey, I like this song.

46:55.113 --> 46:56.813
Thank you, Hailey.

47:01.286 --> 47:04.487
It feels good to have
someone to talk to.

49:10.748 --> 49:11.614
Hailey!

49:49.620 --> 49:50.486
Hailey!

49:53.291 --> 49:54.156
Hailey!

49:56.794 --> 49:57.660
Hailey!

50:00.164 --> 50:04.100
Hailey!

50:04.102 --> 50:05.201
Hailey!

52:13.131 --> 52:14.330
Okay, okay.

53:24.068 --> 53:25.434
Socks never ran away.

53:28.172 --> 53:31.373
My dad, he woke me
up that morning.

53:34.145 --> 53:37.146
He told me to go
to the backyard.

53:39.250 --> 53:41.951
He had Socks tied to the post.

53:43.721 --> 53:46.255
He told me we couldn't keep him

53:47.191 --> 53:49.458
and I had broken the rule.

53:51.162 --> 53:54.063
Said that I need to be punished.

53:56.867 --> 54:01.804
He put the knife in my hand.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.073
He told me he does it

54:06.510 --> 54:07.343
or I do.

54:10.381 --> 54:13.015
And it's the only way I'd learn.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.087
I made it quick.

54:20.424 --> 54:22.024
He wouldn't have.

54:27.398 --> 54:28.297
It was quick.

55:26.123 --> 55:27.423
Hello, my girl.

55:35.466 --> 55:36.665
I know you're hungry.

55:47.945 --> 55:50.245
Are you gonna be a good
girl for me tonight?

55:54.719 --> 55:57.853
If you don't, you'll be
in here for another week.

55:59.890 --> 56:01.590
Daddy doesn't wanna
put you in here

56:02.693 --> 56:04.426
but you leave him no choice.

56:08.466 --> 56:09.431
You want your sandwich?

56:16.040 --> 56:16.905
Good girl.

56:19.643 --> 56:20.476
Go ahead.

56:22.713 --> 56:23.579
Hey.

56:32.189 --> 56:33.455
Who's my star?

57:45.296 --> 57:46.929
Thanks.

57:46.931 --> 57:48.797
I appreciate this.

57:48.799 --> 57:50.566
My truck won't even
make it two miles

57:50.568 --> 57:51.467
without breaking down.

57:51.469 --> 57:52.568
Yeah, don't worry about it.

57:52.570 --> 57:54.169
I'm heading into town anyway.

57:55.072 --> 57:56.472
Is Ben coming?

57:56.474 --> 57:58.674
No, he's off somewhere
doing god knows what.

57:59.477 --> 58:00.809
Let's get going.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.412
I wanna make it to the
shop before it closes.

58:03.414 --> 58:05.414
And Murray always
shuts down early

58:05.416 --> 58:07.850
to knock back a few and
thinks no one notices.

58:14.625 --> 58:15.991
I mean he's sitting
in a bar on a Tuesday

58:15.993 --> 58:17.593
when he's supposed to
be running the shop.

58:17.595 --> 58:19.661
What does he think,
no one sees him?

58:20.764 --> 58:23.365
Murray's not the
sharpest tool in the shed.

58:23.367 --> 58:24.800
And then when you do
get him in the garage

58:24.802 --> 58:26.368
he does nothing but
bitch and complain

58:26.370 --> 58:27.536
about his workload
as you're trying

58:27.538 --> 58:29.538
to fill out your paperwork.

58:29.540 --> 58:30.772
Asshole.

58:30.774 --> 58:32.541
There's other
mechanics, you know?

58:32.543 --> 58:33.342
Who?

58:33.344 --> 58:34.710
Joe's dumb ass son?

58:35.446 --> 58:36.211
Or Marty?

58:36.213 --> 58:37.446
That shithead.

58:37.448 --> 58:39.448
Always charges me
extra for special parts

58:39.450 --> 58:41.517
he needs to bring in from China.

58:41.519 --> 58:43.018
Yeah, no thanks.

58:43.020 --> 58:45.120
Why don't I take a look at it?

58:45.122 --> 58:47.356
No, I couldn't
ask you to do that.

58:47.358 --> 58:48.657
Why, you got a
problem with me now?

58:48.659 --> 58:50.225
No, of course not.

58:51.896 --> 58:53.562
I do however, have a problem

58:53.564 --> 58:55.697
with that cancer stick
you're sucking on.

58:57.368 --> 58:58.867
You know the rules.

58:58.869 --> 59:01.069
My truck, my rules.

59:01.071 --> 59:02.471
Ben had better
arguments than that

59:02.473 --> 59:03.472
when he was six.

59:05.576 --> 59:06.608
He's a smart kid.

59:07.645 --> 59:10.045
I see a lot of myself in him.

59:10.047 --> 59:11.280
Don't start, Adams.

59:14.318 --> 59:15.717
You need anything?

59:15.719 --> 59:17.319
No, I'm good.

59:17.321 --> 59:18.086
Okay.

59:18.088 --> 59:19.288
Just be a sec.

59:25.663 --> 59:27.629
Son of a bitch.

59:33.871 --> 59:34.736
Ow!

1:00:00.397 --> 1:00:01.797
Hey, I picked up some dill.

1:00:03.133 --> 1:00:05.734
We fry up those
fish, a little lemon,

1:00:05.736 --> 1:00:06.635
put some dill on.

1:00:08.572 --> 1:00:08.971
Got everything you needed?

1:00:12.776 --> 1:00:15.911
Still upset Murray
talked your ear off?

1:00:15.913 --> 1:00:16.845
You know Murray.

1:00:17.648 --> 1:00:19.548
Yeah, well.

1:00:19.550 --> 1:00:21.817
One of these days, he's
gonna be dead Murray.

1:00:24.588 --> 1:00:25.454
You all right?

1:00:26.624 --> 1:00:27.723
I'm fine.

1:00:29.059 --> 1:00:30.425
You look a little bit sick.

1:00:30.427 --> 1:00:31.293
I'm fine.

1:00:34.932 --> 1:00:35.797
If you say so.

1:00:57.755 --> 1:00:58.820
Hey!

1:00:59.923 --> 1:01:01.056
Don't forget your part.

1:01:17.274 --> 1:01:18.640
You sure you don't
need any help?

1:01:18.642 --> 1:01:19.508
No.

1:01:20.778 --> 1:01:21.643
All right.

1:01:21.645 --> 1:01:22.744
Take it easy.

1:01:42.299 --> 1:01:43.131
No, no!

1:04:41.879 --> 1:04:43.745
Everything's
okay now, darling.

1:04:45.983 --> 1:04:46.915
I promised you.

1:04:50.988 --> 1:04:53.054
I always kept my
promises, didn't I?

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:58.994
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:05:10.774 --> 1:05:12.807
I did the dishes,
no need to thank me.

1:05:13.577 --> 1:05:15.443
Ben, Ben?

1:05:18.916 --> 1:05:20.015
Ben!

1:05:23.921 --> 1:05:24.753
Hailey.

1:05:27.724 --> 1:05:28.757
This is unexpected.

1:05:31.528 --> 1:05:33.094
I can see how it would be.

1:05:34.698 --> 1:05:35.997
Where's Ben?

1:05:37.134 --> 1:05:38.466
He's not here.

1:05:38.468 --> 1:05:40.035
Yeah, I can see that.

1:05:40.037 --> 1:05:41.136
Where is he?

1:05:42.773 --> 1:05:44.973
Do you know when
a dog is in pain,

1:05:44.975 --> 1:05:46.808
it makes this high pitched tone?

1:05:48.045 --> 1:05:49.144
It's excruciating.

1:05:54.051 --> 1:05:54.883
Where's Ben?

1:05:57.287 --> 1:06:00.755
Where's Ben?!

1:06:00.757 --> 1:06:02.023
Where's my son?!

1:06:05.896 --> 1:06:06.962
Why are you here?

1:06:10.968 --> 1:06:12.734
You're not supposed to be here.

1:06:14.071 --> 1:06:15.804
I came to tell
you about Tressa.

1:06:50.207 --> 1:06:51.072
Hailey.

1:06:54.311 --> 1:06:55.276
What are you doin'?

1:06:59.182 --> 1:07:00.015
Okay.

1:07:02.152 --> 1:07:03.118
I'll see you later.

1:07:12.029 --> 1:07:13.895
You know I can read
your face like a book.

1:07:13.897 --> 1:07:15.997
You can't even
read a book, Adam.

1:07:15.999 --> 1:07:18.333
Let alone read my face.

1:07:18.335 --> 1:07:20.468
Okay, your bid.

1:07:20.470 --> 1:07:22.203
I'm leaving.

1:07:22.205 --> 1:07:23.938
T, hold on, I need your help.

1:07:26.043 --> 1:07:27.042
Hey, Tressa.

1:07:27.044 --> 1:07:28.309
Off to work?

1:07:28.311 --> 1:07:29.244
Isn't that obvious?

1:07:29.246 --> 1:07:31.179
Hey, let's show some manners.

1:07:31.181 --> 1:07:32.013
Sorry.

1:07:32.015 --> 1:07:32.981
Dad, I gotta go.

1:07:34.051 --> 1:07:35.350
What
time you coming home?

1:07:35.352 --> 1:07:37.352
I don't
know, late, probably.

1:07:37.354 --> 1:07:39.187
You want
me to give you a ride?

1:07:39.189 --> 1:07:41.189
I'll get Cass to drive me.

1:07:41.191 --> 1:07:41.990
Are you sure?

1:07:41.992 --> 1:07:43.258
Yeah.

1:07:43.260 --> 1:07:45.060
Does Ben know Hailey's here?

1:07:45.062 --> 1:07:46.261
Ah, he knows.

1:07:46.263 --> 1:07:48.163
Won't come out of his room.

1:07:48.165 --> 1:07:49.898
Okay, I have to go.

1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:52.267
Hey, whoa whoa, hold up.

1:07:52.269 --> 1:07:53.635
You forgetting something?

1:07:56.673 --> 1:07:58.173
Seeya.

1:07:58.175 --> 1:07:59.174
Love you, darling.

1:07:59.176 --> 1:08:00.175
I'll save you a plate.

1:08:00.177 --> 1:08:01.176
All right.

1:08:01.178 --> 1:08:02.143
That right there,

1:08:03.213 --> 1:08:04.179
that's my good luck.

1:08:04.181 --> 1:08:06.347
Oh, now I should be worried?

1:08:06.349 --> 1:08:09.651
Indeed you should.

1:08:13.356 --> 1:08:14.355
Remember, Hailey.

1:08:16.093 --> 1:08:18.693
Daddy needs you to be a
good girl for me tonight.

1:08:26.937 --> 1:08:27.802
Okay?

1:08:30.407 --> 1:08:31.272
Good girl.

1:08:49.159 --> 1:08:50.291
Tressa.

1:08:50.293 --> 1:08:51.159
Tressa.

1:08:52.262 --> 1:08:54.129
Mr. Adams?

1:08:54.131 --> 1:08:55.196
What are you doing here?

1:08:56.399 --> 1:08:58.166
What was that?

1:08:58.168 --> 1:08:59.033
What?

1:09:00.003 --> 1:09:00.835
A cigarette?

1:09:02.072 --> 1:09:04.272
What if it's your dad that
pulled up instead of me?

1:09:04.274 --> 1:09:06.241
Can you please not tell him?

1:09:06.243 --> 1:09:08.176
Please, I promise I
don't do it very often.

1:09:08.178 --> 1:09:10.345
Hey, you don't have
to worry about me.

1:09:10.347 --> 1:09:13.081
You just have to be
more careful, okay?

1:09:13.083 --> 1:09:15.083
Okay, thanks.

1:09:15.085 --> 1:09:16.985
Come on, I'll give
you a ride home.

1:09:16.987 --> 1:09:19.154
I'm waiting for my
friend, she's closing.

1:09:19.156 --> 1:09:22.323
Well, I can give you a ride
home right now if you want.

1:09:25.128 --> 1:09:26.661
Okay.

1:09:26.663 --> 1:09:28.263
One sec.

1:09:28.265 --> 1:09:30.198
Hey, you want a milkshake?

1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:31.032
We have mint.

1:09:34.171 --> 1:09:35.036
She'd love one.

1:10:01.798 --> 1:10:02.630
How was work?

1:10:04.034 --> 1:10:05.200
It was okay.

1:10:06.403 --> 1:10:08.970
I spilled ketchup
on Mr. Soleman.

1:10:08.972 --> 1:10:10.238
Who's that?

1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:12.307
My old history
teacher.

1:10:12.309 --> 1:10:14.142
He left a good tip too.

1:10:14.144 --> 1:10:15.410
Oh, how could he not?

1:10:15.412 --> 1:10:16.644
I'm sure you're probably
one of his favorites.

1:10:16.646 --> 1:10:18.313
Uh, no, he hated me.

1:10:19.883 --> 1:10:21.249
Why would you say that?

1:10:22.485 --> 1:10:24.085
It was the way
he used to stare at me.

1:10:28.024 --> 1:10:29.290
Probably admires you.

1:10:30.927 --> 1:10:32.293
That's stupid.

1:10:36.032 --> 1:10:37.398
Depends on your perspective.

1:10:48.245 --> 1:10:49.944
Why are we stopping?

1:10:49.946 --> 1:10:52.780
Oh, I thought I heard
something in the engine.

1:10:54.351 --> 1:10:55.617
Sounded like a rattling sound.

1:10:55.619 --> 1:10:56.651
You don't hear that?

1:10:57.721 --> 1:10:59.087
I didn't hear anything.

1:11:00.890 --> 1:11:02.790
Just let me take a
look. I'll just be a sec.

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:14.702
What are you
doing out this late?

1:11:16.539 --> 1:11:18.273
Isn't it way past your bedtime?

1:11:20.477 --> 1:11:21.743
What is it?

1:12:07.324 --> 1:12:08.589
Your shake's melting.

1:12:16.199 --> 1:12:19.033
Wanna know what I was
thinking the whole time?

1:12:19.035 --> 1:12:20.234
How much I hated mint.

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:23.571
Where is she?

1:12:27.143 --> 1:12:28.009
I don't know.

1:12:29.279 --> 1:12:31.012
You don't know?

1:12:31.014 --> 1:12:33.181
Why are you telling me this?

1:12:33.183 --> 1:12:35.850
Because it wasn't my fault.

1:12:35.852 --> 1:12:37.185
I was just a little kid.

1:12:38.388 --> 1:12:39.687
You lived under his roof.

1:12:40.990 --> 1:12:42.857
His blood is in your veins.

1:12:44.227 --> 1:12:45.226
He raised you.

1:12:46.830 --> 1:12:48.563
That doesn't make you innocent.

1:12:52.869 --> 1:12:53.968
I'm not my father.

1:12:56.172 --> 1:13:01.109
No.

1:13:01.378 --> 1:13:06.481
Not yet.

1:14:21.257 --> 1:14:22.323
Oh my god!

1:15:25.522 --> 1:15:26.387
Do it!

1:15:27.824 --> 1:15:28.689
Do it!

1:15:31.060 --> 1:15:31.926
Do it.

1:15:34.564 --> 1:15:35.897
I told you.

1:15:36.699 --> 1:15:37.698
I'm not my father.

1:15:47.644 --> 1:15:49.877
Do you believe I was
never a violent man?

1:15:53.483 --> 1:15:54.749
I had the hammer.

1:15:56.653 --> 1:15:57.485
I was ready.

1:15:59.222 --> 1:15:59.787
I needed to.

1:16:03.092 --> 1:16:03.958
I wanted to.

1:16:07.397 --> 1:16:08.629
I went to your home.

1:16:09.599 --> 1:16:11.666
To make him pay for what he did.

1:16:15.038 --> 1:16:16.337
But he was already dead.

1:16:19.442 --> 1:16:20.308
A stroke.

1:16:24.247 --> 1:16:25.613
He died peacefully

1:16:28.518 --> 1:16:31.752
when my daughter
decayed somewhere

1:16:33.289 --> 1:16:34.522
I'll never know!

1:16:41.097 --> 1:16:42.763
Goodbye, Gregory.

1:16:42.765 --> 1:16:43.965
Where are you going?

1:16:45.301 --> 1:16:46.167
Hailey!

1:16:47.604 --> 1:16:48.469
Hailey!

1:16:49.405 --> 1:16:50.271
Hailey!
