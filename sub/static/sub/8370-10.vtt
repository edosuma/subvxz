Mmm-mmm!

You look tasty!

01:19.267 --> 01:21.969
Who's there?

01:22.020 --> 01:26.106
I'm Makuu the crocodile!
And I'm gonna eat you!

01:30.145 --> 01:31.278
Mmm-mmm!

01:31.312 --> 01:33.147
GOIGOI: You look tasty!

01:34.282 --> 01:37.067
Goigoi... the jackal?

01:37.069 --> 01:39.370
That's right.
And I'm gonna eat you!

01:45.160 --> 01:46.293
Mmm-mmm!

01:46.327 --> 01:48.045
JANJA: You look tasty!

01:48.079 --> 01:49.046
Huh?

01:50.081 --> 01:51.965
JANJA: I'm gonna eat you!

01:52.000 --> 01:53.083
Janja the hyena!

01:53.134 --> 01:55.002
Ahhh!

01:55.053 --> 01:56.136
<i>- ALL: Help!
- Ahhh!</i>

01:56.171 --> 01:57.304
- Lion Guard!
- Thank goodness!

01:57.338 --> 01:59.056
What is it?
What's wrong?

01:59.090 --> 02:00.090
- Makuu!
- Goigoi!

02:00.141 --> 02:03.927
- Janja!
- Lion Guard, we'll need to split up!

02:03.978 --> 02:06.847
Fuli, you and Ono
take on Goigoi.

02:06.898 --> 02:09.265
Beshte, you and Bunga
go after Makuu.

02:09.268 --> 02:11.101
Leave Janja to me!

02:11.103 --> 02:13.270
You three, take us to 'em!

02:13.321 --> 02:15.105

<i>ALL: Lion Guard defend!</i>

02:21.162 --> 02:25.866
- Okay, where was Janja?
- Right behind my den!

02:25.917 --> 02:27.918
Okay. Stay back.

02:29.337 --> 02:32.923
Janja! Show yourself!

02:34.959 --> 02:37.127
Huh. Nobody here.

02:37.129 --> 02:39.346
All right, Makuu!
We're coming to getcha!

02:42.967 --> 02:46.220
Hello?
Makuu?

02:46.271 --> 02:49.223
Maybe he heard us and ran!
Or swam!

02:49.274 --> 02:51.225
Anyway, he's gone now!

02:51.276 --> 02:54.194
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

02:54.229 --> 02:57.064
Makuu ate all the roots
I was having for lunch!

02:58.983 --> 03:01.869
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

03:01.903 --> 03:04.238
Oh, no sign of Goigoi from above.

03:04.289 --> 03:09.076
I searched around every tree in
these woods. Not a jackal in sight.

03:09.127 --> 03:11.962
But... My leafy greens
are gone!

03:11.996 --> 03:13.213
The jackals
must have eaten them!

03:13.248 --> 03:14.832
Hmm.

03:14.883 --> 03:17.084
Well, at least they didn't eat you.

03:17.135 --> 03:20.254
There's no trace of Janja and
his hyenas anywhere around here.

03:22.140 --> 03:24.057
Not even their scent.

03:24.092 --> 03:27.060
And, believe me, if they
were around, you'd smell them.

03:27.095 --> 03:28.979
But they were here!

03:29.013 --> 03:32.149
They've eaten all the bugs that
I was going to eat for lunch!

03:32.183 --> 03:34.234
Hey, the crocodiles
ate my lunch, too!

03:34.269 --> 03:36.069
And the jackals ate mine!

03:36.104 --> 03:38.188
Did you find Makuu or Goigoi?

03:38.239 --> 03:39.239
- Nope!
- No.

03:39.274 --> 03:40.324
- Nothing.
- Uh-uh.

03:40.358 --> 03:43.193
Strange.
Janja wasn't here either.

03:43.244 --> 03:46.163
I bet Makuu, Goigoi,
and Janja heard us coming!

03:46.197 --> 03:48.332
See, that's just
how good we are.

03:48.366 --> 03:51.952
We just show up, and all
of those baddies run off!

03:52.003 --> 03:53.253
KION: I'm not so sure.

03:53.288 --> 03:56.924
I didn't even find any hyena tracks.

03:56.958 --> 03:58.208
No sign of Janja at all.

03:58.210 --> 04:01.211
Hey, wait. I didn't see
any jackal tracks, either!

04:01.262 --> 04:04.932
- Did we see any crocodile tracks?
- Uh, I don't think so.

04:04.966 --> 04:08.218
And last I checked, none
of them eat roots or leaves.

04:08.220 --> 04:12.856
Right. And Janja
doesn't usually eat bugs...

04:12.891 --> 04:16.108
Are you sure it was Makuu,
Goigoi and Janja you saw?

04:16.144 --> 04:19.196
Well, I didn't
actually see Janja.

04:19.230 --> 04:20.947
I didn't see Goigoi, either.

04:20.982 --> 04:23.867
I didn't stick around
long enough to see Makuu.

04:23.902 --> 04:25.068
But I sure heard him.

04:25.119 --> 04:28.071
He said, "Mmm-mmm!

04:28.073 --> 04:29.239
"You look tasty!

04:29.290 --> 04:31.124
"I'm gonna eat you!"

04:31.159 --> 04:32.960
That's what Goigoi said.

04:32.994 --> 04:35.913
- And Janja!
- Wait.

04:35.915 --> 04:39.082
Makuu, Goigoi and Janja
all said the same thing?

04:40.168 --> 04:42.085
Something weird is going on.

04:42.136 --> 04:44.087
Ono, scout the Pride Lands.

04:44.138 --> 04:47.090
See if you can find
Makuu, Goigoi and Janja.

04:47.092 --> 04:48.976
Affirmative!

04:50.094 --> 04:51.895
Hold on!
Do you hear that?

04:51.930 --> 04:53.180
JANJA: We've got you now!

04:53.231 --> 04:54.932
Sounds like Janja!

04:54.934 --> 04:57.935
- Janja? Ahhh!
- This way!

04:57.937 --> 05:01.238
You guys wait here.
Time to figure out what's going on.

05:01.272 --> 05:05.158
- Till the Pride Lands' end...
- ALL: Lion Guard defend!

05:07.111 --> 05:09.246
I don't hear Janja anymore.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.948
I can't see him either!

05:12.284 --> 05:13.951
Shh...

05:14.002 --> 05:16.007
Janja. Come on.

05:19.874 --> 05:23.293
Wait!
It's not Janja!

05:23.344 --> 05:28.131
No, no, no, I'm not.
I'm Tamaa the drongo!

05:28.133 --> 05:31.301
- A drongo...
- Well, don't worry, Tamaa.

05:31.303 --> 05:33.136
We won't let Janja hurt you.

05:33.187 --> 05:36.023
Why would Janja hurt me?

05:36.057 --> 05:39.977
Oh, right!
You heard him just now.

05:39.979 --> 05:41.945
Yeah, and he sounded close.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.948
Oh, he was.
Very close indeed!

05:44.983 --> 05:47.901
But then he
and his hyenas ran off.

05:47.952 --> 05:51.989
- They went... that-a-way!
- Thanks, Tamaa!

05:52.040 --> 05:53.991
Till the Pride Lands' end...

05:54.042 --> 05:56.994
<i>ALL: Lion Guard defend.</i>

05:57.045 --> 05:59.913
Good thing that drongo actually
saw where the hyenas went!

05:59.964 --> 06:02.165
Yeah, he's the first one
to see anything!

06:03.001 --> 06:04.167
<i> Hapana!</i>

06:04.218 --> 06:06.053
Tamaa's a drongo!

06:06.087 --> 06:08.171
That explains everything!

06:08.173 --> 06:11.101
Everyone, everyone!
Follow me! Quick!

06:11.221 --> 06:13.143
- Ono?
- I figured it out. Come on!

06:14.062 --> 06:15.012
Okay.

06:17.849 --> 06:19.016
Mmm-mmm!

06:19.067 --> 06:21.018
You look tasty!

06:21.020 --> 06:23.020
I'm gonna eat you!

06:25.990 --> 06:27.190
KION: Not so fast!

06:27.192 --> 06:29.109
Un-Bunga-lievable!

06:29.160 --> 06:31.161
You sounded just like Janja.

06:31.195 --> 06:33.330
That's because
he's a drongo.

06:33.364 --> 06:37.000
And drongos can make their
voice sound like other animals.

06:37.035 --> 06:40.253
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, it's true.

06:40.288 --> 06:42.289
I can sound
like other animals.

06:42.340 --> 06:45.208
Any other animal
in the Pride Land, really.

06:45.259 --> 06:47.177
It's my little talent.

06:47.211 --> 06:49.927
Which you've been using to scare animals

06:49.979 --> 06:52.265
- all over the Pride Lands.
- Admit it!

06:52.300 --> 06:54.051
Who, me?
No!

06:54.102 --> 06:55.910
I never...

06:57.105 --> 06:59.973
I mean...
It wasn't me who...

07:01.142 --> 07:03.060
I can explain...

07:03.062 --> 07:06.813
All right, kids. You got me.

07:06.864 --> 07:10.984
I pretended to be Janja.
And Makuu. And Goigoi.

07:11.035 --> 07:14.905
But so what?
Is there any harm in that?

07:14.956 --> 07:18.041
You scared little animals,
so they'd run away.

07:18.076 --> 07:22.079
Is it my fault that my
performances are so convincing?

07:22.081 --> 07:23.914
It's a compliment, really.

07:23.916 --> 07:25.966
But you did it
to steal their food!

07:26.000 --> 07:28.085
Steal?
No, no, no!

07:28.136 --> 07:30.087
It's an act!
It's a show!

07:30.089 --> 07:33.223
It's all in fun!
I do some voices...

07:33.257 --> 07:35.617
and if my audience happens to leave me a

07:35.618 --> 07:37.978
little food as a reward,
well, is that so wrong?

07:38.012 --> 07:40.897
- Uh, yeah.
- Who do you think you are?

07:40.932 --> 07:42.049

- Bunga. Focus.

If I had an amazing talent like yours,

09:46.224 --> 09:49.860
You're right!
Of course you're right.

09:49.894 --> 09:52.279
Why, oh, why,
did I never think of that?

09:52.313 --> 09:56.983

snouts and mouths of the innocent?

The pain.

- Hmm...
- I feel so ashamed.

- Tell you what.

And this time, I can see them.

10:28.349 --> 10:30.934
And we're here wasting time
talking to you.

No more imitating!

you to dinner.

- Sure.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.288
They're gonna
be the main course!

10:53.174 --> 10:54.257
Good one, Janja.

10:54.292 --> 10:55.959
Yeah.

10:59.964 --> 11:02.215
What's so funny, hyena?

11:02.266 --> 11:05.268
- Uh, nothin'...
- Don't you remember?

11:05.303 --> 11:10.140
Janja made that great joke
about eatin' the impalas.

11:10.142 --> 11:14.311
- Er, wait how did it go again?
- Stuff it, fur brain.

11:14.362 --> 11:17.314
I'm going to give you hyenas
till the count of three

11:17.365 --> 11:19.316
to get out
of the Pride Lands.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.318
You can count to three?

11:21.369 --> 11:24.154
Ooh, I wanna hear it!

11:24.205 --> 11:25.956
Nice seein' ya, Kion.

11:25.990 --> 11:28.908
Love to stay and chat,
but we were just leaving.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.994
We were?

11:31.045 --> 11:35.081
- One... Two...
- We're going, we're going!

11:36.300 --> 11:38.134
The faster, the better.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.920
That was a close call.

11:40.972 --> 11:43.166
You said it.
We were so busy

11:43.201 --> 11:45.175
searching for phony
crocs, jackals and hyenas,

11:45.177 --> 11:47.927
we almost missed
the real hyenas' attack.

11:47.979 --> 11:50.063
Let's just hope Tamaa
keeps his promise

11:50.097 --> 11:52.182
so we don't have
any more false alarms.

11:58.356 --> 12:00.106
Hi. How ya doin'?

12:00.157 --> 12:03.193
Ooh. That's a nice sized
pile of grubs you got there!

12:03.244 --> 12:05.028
Uh, thank you.

12:05.030 --> 12:08.031
So, uh, you think
you're gonna eat 'em all?

12:08.082 --> 12:09.249
Probably.

12:09.283 --> 12:11.868
'Cause I wouldn't mind
eating a bite or two,

12:11.919 --> 12:14.037
if you've got some to spare.

12:14.088 --> 12:16.172
I'm feeling a little peckish.

12:16.207 --> 12:18.925
Ha! Get it?
Peckish!

12:18.959 --> 12:22.879
I've got a beak, see?
I peck things with it.

12:22.881 --> 12:24.047
Pretty funny, right?

12:25.049 --> 12:26.299
Uh, yeah.

12:30.221 --> 12:32.889
Seriously, do you have
some food you can give me?

12:32.891 --> 12:36.226
- I'm really hungry.
- Sorry, but these are my grubs.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.061
You'll need to find your own.

12:38.112 --> 12:40.230
I bet you wouldn't
say that to Janja!

12:45.953 --> 12:50.040
You know, sometimes I think
the Lion Guard doesn't like us.

12:50.074 --> 12:51.958
I know, right?

12:51.992 --> 12:54.077
So now what are
we gonna eat, Janja?

12:54.079 --> 12:56.996
Mmm-mmm!
You look tasty!

12:57.048 --> 13:01.134
- I'm gonna eat you!
- Me?

13:01.168 --> 13:03.053
Did you just say
you're gonna eat me?

13:03.087 --> 13:04.220
No!

13:04.255 --> 13:07.257
Does that mean
you're gonna eat me?

13:07.259 --> 13:11.311
No, fur brains.
It means I didn't say anything.

13:11.345 --> 13:16.182
- But somebody did.
- Yeah. It sure sounded like you.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.984
Yeah, he did.

13:18.018 --> 13:21.274
And he also sounded
like he's over there.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.942
Mmm-mmm.
Did you hear me?

13:28.112 --> 13:30.280
I said I'm going to eat you!

13:30.282 --> 13:33.867
Yeah, I heard you.
Grab that bird.

13:36.170 --> 13:38.088
Wait, don't eat me.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.207
I mean, wait, don't eat me!

13:41.258 --> 13:43.259
He is a little small.

13:43.294 --> 13:45.211
Hardly enough to go around.

13:45.262 --> 13:47.964
If he helps us
with my new plan,

13:47.966 --> 13:50.049
maybe we won't eat him at all.

13:50.101 --> 13:53.781
- What do you need me to do?
- Oh, you'll see.

13:56.107 --> 13:58.308
Now just say
what I told you to say.

13:58.310 --> 14:01.832
But make it sound like
you're Kion. Got it?

14:02.947 --> 14:04.898
Uh, I don't think I can.

14:04.949 --> 14:06.900
I've never done Kion's
voice before.

14:06.951 --> 14:08.868
Oh, is that so?
Well, that's okay.

14:08.903 --> 14:10.286
I gotcha. No problem.

14:10.321 --> 14:13.156
So how's about you sayin'
somethin' for me in your own voice?

14:13.207 --> 14:15.291
Sure, I can do that!
What do you want me to say?

14:15.326 --> 14:17.043
Say goodbye.

14:17.077 --> 14:19.295
'Cause if I'm not eating
impala today,

14:19.330 --> 14:21.998
I'm eating drongo!

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
You know,
now that I think about it...

14:24.051 --> 14:27.003
maybe I can do Kion's voice!

14:28.923 --> 14:30.140
Hey, impalas!

14:30.174 --> 14:31.891
It's me, Kion.

14:31.926 --> 14:33.927
Leader of the Lion Guard.

14:33.978 --> 14:36.179
The hyenas are back
in the Pride Land.

14:36.230 --> 14:38.848
So you better
run to the Outlands!

14:42.153 --> 14:44.904
Impalas, what are you waiting for?

14:44.939 --> 14:48.074
Hyenas are coming!
Escape to the Outlands!

14:48.108 --> 14:49.943
Right now!

14:49.994 --> 14:52.028
You don't have to tell me twice!

14:52.079 --> 14:54.330
Panic and run, panic and run.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.201
Shoo! Scat! Run!

15:10.097 --> 15:12.882
Let's go, boys.

15:12.884 --> 15:15.018
Our dinner is being delivered!

15:15.052 --> 15:16.886
I sounded good, didn't I?

15:16.937 --> 15:19.889
Would you believe I'd never
done Kion's voice before?

15:19.891 --> 15:21.974
Ya gotta love it. Right?

15:22.359 --> 15:26.279
So, can I go now?
I did what you asked!

15:26.313 --> 15:28.940
Hmm... not yet.

15:29.984 --> 15:32.118
You still might come in handy.

15:32.152 --> 15:35.038
I think I'll keep you
around for a while.

15:37.075 --> 15:39.909
Could you at least
stop breathing on me?

15:39.911 --> 15:41.911
I've got sensitive feathers.

15:41.913 --> 15:43.246
Sensitive feather.

15:47.918 --> 15:49.252
Pretty quiet.

15:49.254 --> 15:51.921
Guess Tamaa really
is keeping his promise.

15:53.307 --> 15:56.175
No sign of Janja, Cheezi
and Chungu either.

15:56.227 --> 15:59.062
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

15:59.096 --> 16:00.897
Head for the Outlands.

16:00.931 --> 16:05.068
- They're the only safe place to be.
- Whoa! What? No!

16:05.102 --> 16:07.186
Where'd you get
such a crazy idea?

16:07.238 --> 16:10.273
- From Kion.
- I never said that.

16:10.275 --> 16:13.826
Yes you did. I heard you
say it to the impalas.

16:13.861 --> 16:18.114
And everyone knows zebras have the
best hearing in the Pride Lands.

16:18.116 --> 16:22.091
So if you heard Kion say
"Go to the Outlands,"

16:22.136 --> 16:25.171
- why didn't you go?
- I am going! I just...

16:25.205 --> 16:28.124
Uh, don't know
where the Outlands are.

16:28.175 --> 16:30.293
Hold on.
You say you heard me?

16:30.344 --> 16:35.048
- But you didn't see me.
- So? Hearing is believing.

16:35.099 --> 16:38.948
- Not with Tamaa the drongo around.
- But why would Tamaa

16:38.983 --> 16:41.104
fool the impalas into
going to the Outlands?

16:41.138 --> 16:43.890
Sounds more like Janja to me.

16:43.941 --> 16:46.976
Maybe it was Janja.
And Tamaa.

16:46.978 --> 16:48.278
I know Tamaa's a troublemaker,

16:48.312 --> 16:51.030
but you really think
he'd help Janja?

16:51.065 --> 16:53.032
Maybe he didn't have a choice.

16:53.067 --> 16:55.963
C'mon, Lion Guard.
To the Outlands!

16:57.071 --> 16:58.871
Just a minute.

16:58.906 --> 17:01.157
I thought we weren't supposed
to go to the Outlands!

17:06.964 --> 17:07.997
Come on, fellas!

17:22.180 --> 17:24.847
This was so easy.

17:24.897 --> 17:27.983
I should've got myself
a drongo a long time ago.

17:28.018 --> 17:30.103
You better
get used to us, birdy.

17:30.154 --> 17:33.022
'Cause I'm never
letting you go!

17:34.241 --> 17:37.994
Hear that?
You're never gettin' away from us!

17:40.914 --> 17:44.200
Why would I want to get away?
This is a great set-up!

17:44.251 --> 17:47.411
Yeah!
Huh?

17:47.446 --> 17:48.871
I've always worked alone.

17:48.922 --> 17:51.207
But it's gonna be a lot easier
now that I have a partner.

17:51.209 --> 17:55.211
- Partner?
- Sure! Didn't you hear Janja?

17:55.213 --> 17:58.881
From now on it's just
gonna be me and him!

17:58.883 --> 18:02.935
Just you and Janja?
But what about us?

18:02.970 --> 18:06.189
Oh, I hadn't thought about that.

18:06.223 --> 18:08.057
With me helping Janja,

18:08.108 --> 18:10.810
I don't know if he'll
need you two anymore.

18:10.861 --> 18:13.062
- He won't?
- Not with me around.

18:13.113 --> 18:16.149
But if you were to let me go...

18:17.901 --> 18:21.120
- Uh-uh.
- Ah. Ow. Easy.

18:21.155 --> 18:23.239
Nice try, birdie.

18:23.290 --> 18:27.076
But we ain't lettin' you
go till Janja says so.

18:27.078 --> 18:28.244
Is that a fact?

18:28.246 --> 18:30.046
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

18:32.082 --> 18:33.966
I see...

18:34.001 --> 18:37.636
- Cheezi, let the bird go!
- Uh, okay, Janja.

18:40.057 --> 18:43.518
I don't think it was
really Janja who said that.

18:43.519 --> 18:46.979
No kidding!
Janja's gonna be super mad.

18:47.014 --> 18:50.850
- What are we gonna tell him?
- How about...

18:50.901 --> 18:51.934
nothin'?

18:53.187 --> 18:57.156
Phew. My little talent sure
got me out of that mess.

18:57.191 --> 19:00.276
But it got those
impalas into a mess.

19:00.278 --> 19:02.161
I've gotta try and help 'em.

19:07.951 --> 19:10.119
Let the impalas go, Janja!

19:11.288 --> 19:13.840
You hear that?

19:13.874 --> 19:16.092
We've got you surrounded, hyenas!

19:18.295 --> 19:20.179
There is no way out!

19:21.965 --> 19:24.967
You better run away while you can!

19:26.303 --> 19:30.056
Or be prepared
to fight the Lion Guard!

19:31.892 --> 19:33.142
They're everywhere!

19:36.029 --> 19:47.123
- Any sign of the hyenas, Ono?
- Negative. I don't see them.

19:47.157 --> 19:49.158
This is your last chance, hyenas!

19:49.160 --> 19:50.993
But I do hear something!

19:50.995 --> 19:53.045
Leave now or we're
gonna come get you!

19:53.080 --> 19:54.997
Hey, that was me.

19:55.048 --> 19:56.132
But I'm right here.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.834
It's Tamaa! Come on!

19:58.335 --> 20:01.137
Wow. I really
sounded heroic.

20:01.171 --> 20:03.923
Hey! Wait for me!

20:03.974 --> 20:05.224
You asked for it.

20:05.259 --> 20:07.226
We are comin' in!

20:07.261 --> 20:09.846
Unless you leave now.

20:11.148 --> 20:15.017
Which way we gonna run?
They're all around us!

20:15.019 --> 20:17.019
I don't know.
Maybe we can...

20:17.021 --> 20:19.906
Hey, why isn't there
a bird in your mouth?

20:22.109 --> 20:25.268
You are running out of time, Janja!

20:25.303 --> 20:29.248
Nice try. But we know
the Lion Guard ain't here.

20:29.283 --> 20:32.368
- That's what you think.
- Oh, he's really good!

20:32.370 --> 20:34.871
That time he didn't even
move his mouth.

20:34.922 --> 20:37.874
Get away from the bird, Janja!

20:40.961 --> 20:43.179
Kion!

20:43.213 --> 20:44.881
It's not what you think.

20:44.932 --> 20:47.049
See, uh, we, we were
just helping out

20:47.051 --> 20:50.052
these poor lost impalas.

20:50.103 --> 20:52.889
You know, we thought
we'd show 'em the way home.

20:52.940 --> 20:55.191
We'll take care of the impalas.

20:55.225 --> 20:57.310
Why don't you find
your own way home?

20:57.361 --> 20:59.979
We'll do that.
Let's go, fellas!

21:02.199 --> 21:04.066
And don't come back!

21:11.041 --> 21:13.125
Sorry. I was on a roll.

21:21.335 --> 21:23.920
That was a brave thing
you did back there, Tamaa.

21:23.971 --> 21:25.304
You helped
save the impalas.

21:25.339 --> 21:28.891
Thanks, guys. It felt great
to use my talent for good.

21:28.926 --> 21:32.261
But just so you know,
I don't growl like that.

21:32.312 --> 21:34.096
Ah, good tip.

21:34.147 --> 21:36.265
And this time, I really
have learned my lesson.

21:36.316 --> 21:38.317
From now on,
I'm sticking to my promise.

21:38.352 --> 21:40.903
No more imitating others.

21:41.939 --> 21:43.239
Unless it's for good!

21:43.273 --> 21:46.943
That's great, but couldn't
you imitate me one last time?

21:46.994 --> 21:48.027
Okay.

21:48.078 --> 21:50.635
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

21:51.198 --> 21:53.282
I really do have a great voice.

21:54.307 --> 21:57.154
