02:03.120 --> 02:05.240
So you ready for the math test?

02:05.280 --> 02:06.360
If by "ready"

02:06.361 --> 02:07.440
you mean "in a blind panic

02:07.480 --> 02:08.539
because I don't understand

02:08.541 --> 02:09.600
any of it",

02:09.639 --> 02:11.800
[shrieking]

02:11.840 --> 02:13.640
then yes, I'm completely ready.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.960
[sighs]

02:22.000 --> 02:23.160
Mhmm...

02:23.200 --> 02:25.160
I'm never gonna get this!

02:27.040 --> 02:28.060
What's the penalty

02:28.061 --> 02:29.080
for skipping a test?

02:29.120 --> 02:30.440
Seriously?

02:30.441 --> 02:31.760
You'd rather skip it than study?

02:32.600 --> 02:33.840
I just...

02:33.880 --> 02:35.920
have other things on my mind.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.380
Don't... don't look now, but

02:40.381 --> 02:41.960
Miss Perfect is coming this way.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.400
I gotta get out of here.

02:47.760 --> 02:48.880
- Why?

02:48.881 --> 02:50.000
- Please!

02:52.440 --> 02:53.680
I know a place.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.080
- [Vincent] In the old days,
- this would be

02:58.120 --> 03:00.080
- Where the groundskeeper
- would live.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.360
- Everybody just sorta
- forgot about it,

03:03.400 --> 03:06.520
So I just sorta moved in.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.800
[Mia] Moved in?

03:07.840 --> 03:09.240
[door creaks open]

03:15.720 --> 03:17.640
[Mia] This is all your stuff?

03:17.680 --> 03:19.060
[Vincent] Yeah, I've been sorta

03:19.061 --> 03:20.440
accumulating it for a while.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.040
Nobody ever comes in here.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.880
Really? Ever?

03:23.920 --> 03:26.040
Ever. So feel privileged.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.940
It's like walking around

03:29.941 --> 03:31.280
inside your brain.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.680
I saw you looking at

03:35.681 --> 03:37.080
those blank pages in your book.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.000
- Dunno why that's suddenly
- so important...

03:54.080 --> 03:56.280
WOAH! That was blank!

03:56.320 --> 03:58.400
[sighs] How does that work?

03:58.440 --> 04:00.120
That's a long story.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.680
Hey, pass me that CD...

04:10.120 --> 04:11.496
- [Vincent] I don't know
- what you're doing,

04:11.520 --> 04:13.640
But somehow it's so exciting.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.640
Yeeehaa!

04:15.680 --> 04:17.920
Um... Vincent,

04:17.959 --> 04:19.800
- I know this is
- sort of your place.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.959
- But I gonna have to ask you
- a really big favour.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.160
Could you... um...

04:25.200 --> 04:26.480
leave?

04:26.520 --> 04:28.360
Leave?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.160
I think better when I'm alone...

04:46.000 --> 04:47.460
- Wait... What are you gonna...

04:47.461 --> 04:48.920
- Please, Vincent.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.280
Hi Mia.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.560
Say your password.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.480
"Many where there once was one,

05:09.520 --> 05:10.680
persist until

05:10.681 --> 05:11.840
your task is done."

05:22.800 --> 05:25.000
[screams]

05:27.960 --> 05:29.160
Oof!

05:30.360 --> 05:31.480
[snort]

05:31.520 --> 05:33.280
Lyria!

05:39.760 --> 05:41.400
Hi to you too.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.580
How long have you been

05:42.581 --> 05:43.720
trying to get that?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.520
[fireworks exploding]

05:45.560 --> 05:46.740
Oh! Looks like there's

05:46.741 --> 05:47.920
some kind of celebration!

05:47.960 --> 05:49.160
This I gotta see.

05:49.161 --> 05:50.360
Are you coming?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.960
- [snorts]
- Okay.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.720
Well I can see you're busy.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.440
I'll come back after the party.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.000
[fireworks and cheering]

06:07.280 --> 06:08.920
[cheers and applause]

06:13.040 --> 06:14.080
DING DING!

06:14.120 --> 06:15.480
Take me to Yuko!

06:20.440 --> 06:21.920
Hello?

06:21.960 --> 06:23.000
I'm right here!

06:23.001 --> 06:24.040
Ever think of looking?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.460
I did, but you kind of blend

06:25.461 --> 06:26.840
in with the crowd.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.180
And speaking of crowd,

06:28.181 --> 06:29.480
what's all this for?

06:29.520 --> 06:32.200
Only the best parade ever!

06:34.480 --> 06:35.880
And here comes the hero now!

06:35.920 --> 06:37.440
[Phuddle] Oh no,

06:37.441 --> 06:38.960
you're the heroes!

06:39.000 --> 06:40.600
No, you are! [chuckles]

06:40.640 --> 06:42.280
You're all heroes!

06:43.080 --> 06:44.320
Phuddle!

06:44.360 --> 06:46.520
Mia! Can you believe it?!

06:46.560 --> 06:48.800
And all because I made this!

06:48.840 --> 06:50.720
Oops... Woah...

06:51.680 --> 06:53.000
Ha ha!

06:54.240 --> 06:55.720
[loud cheering]

06:57.800 --> 06:59.520
Today we celebrate a new hero

06:59.521 --> 07:01.240
among the elves.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.880
A most unusual hero indeed.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.000
It is because of this hero

07:06.040 --> 07:07.680
that the wicked Panthea

07:07.681 --> 07:09.320
has at last been driven back,

07:09.360 --> 07:11.500
and will soon be banished

07:11.501 --> 07:13.640
from Centopia forever.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.160
Elfin friends, I give you...

07:17.200 --> 07:19.480
The Trumptus!

07:19.520 --> 07:21.880
[cheering]

07:25.120 --> 07:27.080
[cries] Thank you! Thank you!

07:29.040 --> 07:30.340
[Raynor] The Trumptus

07:30.341 --> 07:31.640
will hold this place of honour

07:31.680 --> 07:33.840
within the palace.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.840
Now! Get out there and use it!

07:35.880 --> 07:37.100
It's not saving any unicorns

07:37.101 --> 07:38.320
sitting here!

07:41.640 --> 07:43.240
Hey, you had it yesterday!

07:43.280 --> 07:45.160
I'm the prince, I should get it!

07:45.200 --> 07:46.400
- Nuh uh!
- Uh-huh!

07:46.440 --> 07:48.360
Nuh uh!

07:48.400 --> 07:50.320
[both grunt]

07:51.480 --> 07:53.080
Wait, hold on!

07:53.120 --> 07:54.300
"When there are many

07:54.301 --> 07:55.480
where once was one."

07:55.520 --> 07:57.200
- It's the new oracle
- from my book.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.480
Phuddle,

07:58.481 --> 07:59.720
why have only one Trumptus?

07:59.760 --> 08:01.720
Why not make more?

08:01.760 --> 08:02.960
- Uhmmm...

08:02.961 --> 08:04.160
- "Many where once was one!"

08:04.200 --> 08:05.200
Give every elf

08:05.201 --> 08:06.201
their own Trumptus.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.100
And "To persist ensures

08:08.101 --> 08:09.960
the day is won!"

08:10.000 --> 08:11.680
That must mean if we don't quit,

08:11.720 --> 08:13.400
Panthea won't stand a chance!

08:13.440 --> 08:15.080
[Raynor] That's brilliant!

08:15.120 --> 08:16.320
Phuddle, begin work

08:16.321 --> 08:17.520
on more Trumptuses...

08:17.560 --> 08:19.400
- ieeh... Trumpti...
- Aa... ah...

08:19.440 --> 08:21.000
- More of those things!
- Mhmmm...

08:21.040 --> 08:22.960
- Immediately!
- Of course!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.920
- I'll get right on that.
- Heh heh...

08:24.960 --> 08:26.640
Here I go! Heh heh.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.840
Making aah... more.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.440
[thunder]

08:36.240 --> 08:38.720
[Panthea] You haven't brought me

08:38.721 --> 08:41.200
a fresh unicorn horn in days

08:41.240 --> 08:42.740
and you are blaming it

08:42.741 --> 08:44.240
on some... flute?

08:44.280 --> 08:46.240
Trombone?

08:46.280 --> 08:47.800
Tuba?

08:47.840 --> 08:50.040
Eeh... Trumptus MA'M!

08:50.080 --> 08:52.680
And it's decimating my...

08:52.720 --> 08:54.000
your army.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.720
Nonsense!

09:03.040 --> 09:05.240
[meows]

09:05.280 --> 09:06.980
[Panthea] You told me

09:06.981 --> 09:08.680
that unicorns regularly graze

09:08.720 --> 09:10.120
in a valley here.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.520
So why are you here,

09:12.560 --> 09:15.480
and not there capturing them?!

09:15.520 --> 09:16.900
That valley

09:16.901 --> 09:18.280
is unapproachable by sky.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.380
We'd be spotted

09:19.381 --> 09:20.440
from the elf palace

09:20.480 --> 09:22.200
long before we got there...

09:22.240 --> 09:24.960
Ugh! You can walk, can't you?!

09:25.880 --> 09:27.200
Yes, my MA'M!

09:27.240 --> 09:29.320
Then why aren't you doing it?!

09:29.360 --> 09:32.040
Right away, anything you say!

09:32.080 --> 09:34.240
UGH!!

09:50.880 --> 09:52.280
Wow! When you want something

09:52.281 --> 09:53.680
you really don't give up do you?

09:53.720 --> 09:54.840
[Yuko] Mia!

09:56.160 --> 09:57.200
Hurry up!

09:58.640 --> 09:59.980
Well, enjoy your apple.

09:59.981 --> 10:01.320
I'll see later.

10:06.520 --> 10:07.960
[Mo] The unicorns are here...

10:07.961 --> 10:09.400
at least a dozen of them.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.660
And the munculus are coming

10:10.661 --> 10:11.880
this way, from the east.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.040
By land this time,

10:13.041 --> 10:14.161
staying hidden in the trees.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.720
We almost flew right past them

10:15.721 --> 10:17.240
on our way back from scouting.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.280
Good thing

10:18.281 --> 10:19.281
Yuko had her eyes peeled.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.580
Mia could go out there

10:20.581 --> 10:21.840
and warn the unicorns.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.080
They'll listen to her.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.320
Any way I can help.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.680
It wouldn't matter.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.080
They're cornered in that valley.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.640
It's like a box canyon.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.320
How fortunate it is, then,

10:30.360 --> 10:31.840
that we have the Trumptus.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.440
Where is it?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.720
It must be found!

10:38.760 --> 10:40.480
Whoever took it

10:40.481 --> 10:42.200
must be really short!

10:42.240 --> 10:44.400
[all] Phuddle?!

10:44.440 --> 10:46.000
- Come on. We'll find him.

10:46.001 --> 10:47.560
- You've not seen him?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.520
- Not since he left
- to make more Trumptuses!

10:49.560 --> 10:51.060
- He's not in the workshop!

10:51.061 --> 10:52.560
- He's not in the courtyard!

10:52.600 --> 10:53.880
Prince Mo, you and Yuko

10:53.881 --> 10:55.160
return to the valley

10:55.200 --> 10:56.280
and keep an eye

10:56.281 --> 10:57.360
on those munculus.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.760
- We're on it!

10:58.761 --> 11:00.120
- Mia, you must find Phuddle.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.360
And find him soon.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.680
For those unicorns,

11:02.720 --> 11:04.600
time grows perilously short.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.760
[Mia] Phuuuuddle?

11:07.800 --> 11:09.440
Phuddle?

11:09.480 --> 11:10.680
Phuddle!!

11:12.120 --> 11:13.480
Phuddle?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.080
[Phuddle cries]

11:17.360 --> 11:18.460
- Phuddle?

11:18.461 --> 11:19.560
- Oh, hey.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.660
Um... just checking for...

11:21.661 --> 11:23.720
knee lint. Yeah... he he...

11:23.760 --> 11:25.100
Nope, everything looks okay.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.440
He he...

11:26.480 --> 11:27.920
Oh well, that's enough break.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.360
Back to work!

11:29.400 --> 11:31.200
- You can forget about working
- right now.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.616
- Just bring
- whatever Trumptuses you've made

11:32.640 --> 11:34.600
To the throne room right away!

11:34.640 --> 11:35.980
Right now?

11:35.981 --> 11:37.320
Um... all of them?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.620
- Yes! It's important!

11:38.621 --> 11:39.880
- The thing is... ugh...

11:39.920 --> 11:41.520
- I don't know
- if I can carry them all!

11:41.560 --> 11:42.840
Then I'll help you.

11:42.841 --> 11:44.120
How many are there?

11:44.160 --> 11:46.160
- Well, lemme see there's...
- hmmm...

11:46.200 --> 11:49.200
Oooh... carry the two... um...

11:49.240 --> 11:51.160
Zero. There are zero.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.320
Well... That's okay.

11:52.321 --> 11:53.440
Just bring the original.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.740
Um... there's kind of a problem

11:54.741 --> 11:56.000
with that too.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.080
[gasps]

12:04.520 --> 12:05.800
[chuckles nervously]

12:05.840 --> 12:07.200
This is the Trumptus?!

12:07.240 --> 12:08.720
What happened to it?!

12:08.760 --> 12:09.976
- I couldn't remember
- how I made it,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.240
So I took it apart to check!

12:11.280 --> 12:12.640
There are some pieces in there

12:12.680 --> 12:14.400
it's just impossible to copy.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.880
- There's no way
- I'll ever be able to make more.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.760
That's the bad news.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.840
"When there are many

12:19.841 --> 12:20.880
where once was one."

12:20.920 --> 12:21.940
I didn't think

12:21.941 --> 12:22.960
it meant many pieces!

12:23.000 --> 12:24.600
- You have to put it
- back together!

12:24.640 --> 12:26.080
That's the other bad news.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.960
I can't... remember... how.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.040
WHAT?! You must have had a plan

12:31.080 --> 12:32.496
- or a blueprint
- or something, right?

12:32.520 --> 12:34.960
That's right! My blueprint!

12:35.000 --> 12:36.480
I forgot it out in the woods!

12:36.481 --> 12:37.960
I keep it in my thinking tree!

12:38.000 --> 12:39.600
Then we're going out to get it.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.880
- The munculus
- will reach those unicorns soon.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.640
There's no time to waste!

12:45.560 --> 12:46.920
Agh!

12:56.280 --> 12:59.760
Keep going! Keep going!

12:59.800 --> 13:01.480
We'll reach those unicorns

13:01.481 --> 13:03.160
before sundown!

13:03.200 --> 13:06.160
Onward, munculus!

13:08.920 --> 13:10.680
What I wouldn't give

13:10.681 --> 13:12.440
for a Trumptus right about now.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.680
You can't remember

13:13.681 --> 13:14.880
which is your thinking tree?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.360
Well look at them!

13:16.400 --> 13:18.560
They all kinda look the same!

13:18.600 --> 13:19.640
But didn't you used to

13:19.641 --> 13:20.680
live in these trees?

13:20.720 --> 13:22.560
- I didn't live here.
- I used to come here

13:22.600 --> 13:24.000
Whenever I wanted to think.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.360
So, like you know, almost never.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.080
- But I'm almost sure
- it was a tall one.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.680
Made of wood. With leaves.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.160
[snorts]

13:31.200 --> 13:32.880
You got that right.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.720
- What did she say?
- Was that about me?

13:34.760 --> 13:35.880
- [snorts]

13:35.881 --> 13:37.000
- Well this is useless.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.680
- There are
- hundreds of these trees.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.780
We'll never find

13:39.781 --> 13:40.840
those blueprints in time.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.920
Okay, here's the plan:

13:44.960 --> 13:47.400
I hide in a hole. And you...

13:47.440 --> 13:49.280
- don't tell anyone
- where the hole is.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.576
- We're gonna
- have to tell the king

13:50.600 --> 13:51.640
The Trumptus is gone.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.280
Whaddya mean "we".

13:53.320 --> 13:54.760
I'm not telling him.

13:54.761 --> 13:56.200
I've got a hole to dig!

13:56.240 --> 13:57.320
Hey!

13:57.360 --> 13:59.000
Lyria, are you coming?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.120
[snorts slightly]

14:00.160 --> 14:02.040
Okay... if you insist.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.720
- [Raynor] Gone? What do you mean
- it's gone?

14:15.760 --> 14:17.600
Well, not so much gone.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.680
No, it's not gone at all.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.480
I've got it right here!

14:22.600 --> 14:24.400
And here.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.200
And some of it here.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.420
- We're doomed.

14:28.421 --> 14:29.600
- Oh dear.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.360
We tried to fix it!

14:31.361 --> 14:33.080
It's just too complicated.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.560
[sighs] I'll just...

14:34.561 --> 14:36.000
turn into a puddle now,

14:36.040 --> 14:37.640
if you don't mind.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.680
Prince Mo,

14:38.681 --> 14:39.681
how would you describe

14:39.720 --> 14:40.960
the munculi numbers?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.440
Overwhelming.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.440
- We lack the numbers
- to resist them.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.000
There is little chance

14:46.001 --> 14:47.520
those unicorns can be saved.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.920
Come on, Mo! There's gotta be

14:48.921 --> 14:50.280
a way to save them.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.520
- Mo!
- I'm sorry, father.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.600
Somebody has to

14:54.601 --> 14:55.640
help those unicorns.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.400
You have to stop them!

15:02.120 --> 15:04.040
[sighs]

15:04.080 --> 15:05.700
There are some who abandon hope

15:05.701 --> 15:07.320
as soon as they face difficulty.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.580
And there are those,

15:08.581 --> 15:09.800
like Mo and Yuko,

15:09.840 --> 15:11.560
who never abandon hope.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.320
Which kind do you suppose

15:13.360 --> 15:15.100
keeps the world

15:15.101 --> 15:16.840
from falling to pieces?

15:16.880 --> 15:18.360
"To persist

15:18.361 --> 15:19.840
ensures the day is won."

15:19.880 --> 15:22.040
- We need to have another look
- at those pieces.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.360
Phuddle?

15:24.400 --> 15:26.200
Phuddle, wait!

15:26.240 --> 15:28.060
I wish I never invented

15:28.061 --> 15:29.880
this thing in the first place!

15:29.920 --> 15:31.400
We can't quit now!

15:31.440 --> 15:32.880
Yuko and Mo need us!

15:32.920 --> 15:33.960
It's too hard.

15:33.961 --> 15:35.000
It can't be done.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.736
- Phuddle, how long did you work
- on the Trumptus

15:36.760 --> 15:38.240
Before you got it right?

15:38.280 --> 15:39.660
Years! When I started,

15:39.661 --> 15:41.040
it was a kazoo.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.880
But you never quit, right?

15:42.920 --> 15:44.280
You kept trying and trying

15:44.281 --> 15:45.640
until it was perfect.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.136
- And look what happened
- because of that.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.000
You saved Centopia.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.480
This morning there was a parade

15:50.481 --> 15:51.920
for something you made!

15:51.960 --> 15:54.240
That was pretty cool.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.700
Right now, Yuko and Mo,

15:55.701 --> 15:57.120
and all those unicorns,

15:57.160 --> 15:58.880
need us to keep trying.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.040
But how?

16:00.041 --> 16:01.160
Without those blueprints,

16:01.200 --> 16:02.220
all these pieces

16:02.221 --> 16:03.240
could fit anywhere.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.800
[elves] Oh, wow!

16:06.680 --> 16:08.000
[Mia] Lyria?

16:12.560 --> 16:14.640
My blueprints!

16:14.680 --> 16:15.940
- [gasps] You found them?!

16:15.941 --> 16:17.200
- [snorts]

16:17.240 --> 16:18.440
- What'd she say?
- She said

16:18.480 --> 16:20.160
She doesn't give up easy.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.160
The Trumptus is only this big!

16:25.200 --> 16:26.660
How can the blueprints

16:26.661 --> 16:28.120
take up all this space?

16:28.160 --> 16:29.440
Oh it's a complicated piece

16:29.441 --> 16:30.720
of musical equipment.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.256
- Do you know
- how much research I did

16:32.280 --> 16:33.960
- When I designed it?
- How much?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.880
None! If I had researched it,

16:35.920 --> 16:37.260
maybe some of this

16:37.261 --> 16:38.600
would make sense!

16:38.640 --> 16:40.480
- [sighs] Okay, start
- at the beginning.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.160
What does that say?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.080
That's a doodle of a chipmunk.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.880
- I like to doodle
- when I'm designing.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.080
I also like chipmunks.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.320
Okay, how hard can it be?

16:52.160 --> 16:53.560
Let the master do it.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.280
Was that parade today for you?

16:55.320 --> 16:56.600
I don't think so.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.640
[blows]

16:57.680 --> 16:58.840
[rubbing noises]

16:58.880 --> 17:00.720
Ughh... ow...

17:00.760 --> 17:04.119
Come on! Fit! FIT!

17:04.160 --> 17:06.079
Uugh!

17:06.119 --> 17:07.720
I told you it can't be done!

17:07.760 --> 17:09.520
- Why won't you
- listen to me?! Huh?

17:13.599 --> 17:14.920
[Mia] Wait a second.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.440
That... looks like... that.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.040
And it looks like

17:19.040 --> 17:20.599
it attaches... to that!

17:20.640 --> 17:23.440
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.760
- Hey!
- Now we're getting somewhere!

17:25.800 --> 17:27.640
- That's a corner piece!
- Yes!

17:27.680 --> 17:29.280
That one screws into the side!

17:29.320 --> 17:31.056
- If that one goes there,
- this one goes there!

17:31.080 --> 17:33.240
Here's another one!

17:33.280 --> 17:35.600
Ok, look, it fits! Perfect!

17:42.040 --> 17:43.456
- [whispering] We have
- to warn them!

17:43.480 --> 17:45.440
No! You'll just spook them,

17:45.480 --> 17:47.216
- and they'll run straight
- at the munculus.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.080
Our only hope is surprise.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.280
So you think there is hope?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.920
- Not really.
- Great.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.416
- As long as
- we're on the same page.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.200
Shh. Here they come.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.800
They haven't seen us.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.760
- Let's go!
- Not yet.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.340
Wait until they're in the open.

18:06.341 --> 18:07.880
Everybody ready!

18:07.920 --> 18:10.080
[Mo] At my signal!

18:10.120 --> 18:11.536
- [muttering] Let's go,
- let's go, let's go...

18:11.560 --> 18:12.680
Wait!

18:16.800 --> 18:18.200
[Mo] Three...

18:18.240 --> 18:19.480
two...

18:19.520 --> 18:21.480
one... let's go!

18:25.560 --> 18:27.280
Oh great.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.580
Can I have one day

18:29.581 --> 18:31.840
that isn't ruined by elves?

18:31.880 --> 18:33.440
[neighing]

18:35.520 --> 18:36.600
[hissing]

18:37.680 --> 18:39.040
[whinnies]

18:39.080 --> 18:40.520
SPLASH! SPLASH!

18:40.560 --> 18:42.520
FSSHHH FSSSHH

18:44.920 --> 18:46.320
SPLASH!

19:00.440 --> 19:02.160
Agh!

19:02.200 --> 19:03.560
Yaa!

19:06.960 --> 19:08.120
[neighs]

19:09.080 --> 19:10.200
[Yuko grunts]

19:11.160 --> 19:12.720
Ugh!

19:12.760 --> 19:13.880
Woaa!

19:20.040 --> 19:21.240
[gasps]

19:22.240 --> 19:23.400
Aargh!

19:24.520 --> 19:25.560
[grunts]

19:28.480 --> 19:31.360
[grunting]

19:31.400 --> 19:33.440
[laughs triumphantly]

19:35.560 --> 19:37.320
BLUUUUURPP!

19:39.920 --> 19:42.120
BLUUUUUUUUUURPP!

19:46.560 --> 19:47.680
Catch!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.160
You might need that!

19:55.120 --> 19:58.600
BLUUUUUURRPP!

20:01.800 --> 20:03.400
This thing really works!

20:03.440 --> 20:05.320
BLUUUUUUUURP!

20:08.080 --> 20:10.320
BLUUUURRPPP!

20:11.360 --> 20:14.040
Oooh! Hold your ground!

20:14.080 --> 20:17.200
We will not back down!

20:18.160 --> 20:19.360
BLUUUUUUUUURP!

20:19.400 --> 20:22.720
Back down! Back down!

20:23.560 --> 20:24.720
[hissing]

20:26.200 --> 20:27.920
- Yeah!
- Yuhu!!

20:30.880 --> 20:32.280
[neighs]

20:36.600 --> 20:38.840
[Yuko] (CHUCKLING) Yeah!

20:43.960 --> 20:47.920
[elves] Yeah! Hurray!!

20:47.960 --> 20:49.140
- That seemed to go well.

20:49.141 --> 20:50.320
- It sure would be nice

20:50.360 --> 20:52.176
- to have more Trumptuses,
- though, wouldn't it?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.856
- I bet I could figure it out
- if I could just

20:53.880 --> 20:55.400
- Take it apart
- one more time...

20:55.440 --> 20:57.840
NO! One will do fine, thank you.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.480
Uh-oh, that doesn't look right.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.620
- I can fix it!

21:01.621 --> 21:02.720
- That's okay.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.200
I'm sure it's just

21:04.201 --> 21:05.640
a loose connection or something.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.280
- Loose connections
- are my specialty.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.480
I loosely connect things

21:08.481 --> 21:09.640
all the time.

21:09.680 --> 21:10.760
Let's just give it

21:10.761 --> 21:11.840
a few seconds,

21:11.880 --> 21:13.360
maybe it'll fix itself.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.400
Things never fix themselves.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.640
- It takes a master!

21:16.641 --> 21:17.840
- Uh oh.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.120
See ya Phuddle!

21:19.121 --> 21:20.360
Say goodbye to Yuko and Mo.

21:26.960 --> 21:27.960
Aw. What's wrong

21:27.961 --> 21:28.961
with this thing?!

21:29.000 --> 21:30.880
Low battery! Darnit!

21:48.040 --> 21:49.220
- I'm back.

21:49.221 --> 21:50.400
- Back?

21:50.440 --> 21:52.160
I mean... done.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.040
I'm done.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.580
People say I'm weird.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.080
But you really take the cake.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.920
What was that all about?

21:58.960 --> 22:01.000
- I'm sorry for kicking you
- out of your own place.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.440
Are you gonna

22:03.441 --> 22:04.520
do that every time?

22:04.560 --> 22:06.220
You mean, you're not mad?

22:06.221 --> 22:07.880
I can come back here?

22:07.920 --> 22:10.000
- Any time.
- Just don't mess up my mess?

22:10.040 --> 22:12.080
I can study here?

22:12.120 --> 22:14.720
You know. Math.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.696
- I thought you said
- you were going to skip the test.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.300
Yeah, well, I figure I'll

22:18.301 --> 22:19.880
give it another shot, right?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.320
Do you feel like studying?

22:21.321 --> 22:22.720
I could use your help.

22:22.760 --> 22:23.960
Well then...

22:28.160 --> 22:30.200
step into my brain.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.160
- But your brain
- needs some re-decorating.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.040
- I think
- I'll hang up some curtains.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.120
Curtains?

22:35.160 --> 22:36.320
Or an air freshener.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.680
And a couple of plants.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.920
Okay now you're pushing it.

22:38.960 --> 22:39.960
[laughs]
