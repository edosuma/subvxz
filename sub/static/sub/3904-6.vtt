WEBVTT

00:10.844 --> 00:12.985
<i>W.M.D.  Got them W.M.D.</i>

00:14.009 --> 00:15.616
You better move it on down.

00:15.940 --> 00:16.797
It ain't pretty.

00:17.816 --> 00:18.861
It doesn't have to be.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.456
It just needs to pull them
from the places still worth salvaging.

00:27.016 --> 00:27.485
Alright.

00:29.503 --> 00:30.900
I told the other shifts

00:31.216 --> 00:32.506
now I'm telling you:

00:33.504 --> 00:35.708
When I ride my district
at the end of this week

00:36.184 --> 00:37.629
I want to see empty corners.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.004
They bring it here,
or the other two free-zones

00:42.309 --> 00:43.821
or you bang them senseless.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.941
Anything you need to do, you do.

00:47.617 --> 00:50.548
Up to a body that can't walk
itself out of an emergency room

00:50.830 --> 00:52.226
I'll back up you and your men.

00:52.343 --> 00:53.305
You understand me ?

00:53.787 --> 00:57.258
Now,'ve detailed our I.I.D. representative
to the range for the entire week.

00:57.868 --> 01:00.831
All citizen complaints will be handled
by Lieutenant Mello here.

01:03.167 --> 01:04.855
Whatever it takes.

01:05.501 --> 01:06.897
Man, I ain't even dirty.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.163
I got rights an' shit.

01:08.398 --> 01:09.979
Go with the one
about staying silent.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.214 --> 01:20.606
Shit like this
don't happen in Hamsterdam.

01:22.456 --> 01:24.768
You gonna humble us
for just standin' somewhere ?

01:24.802 --> 01:26.117
Fuck y'all !
We in america.

01:27.613 --> 01:28.611
West Baltimore.

01:31.087 --> 01:33.373
I swear to god, officer Herc

01:34.065 --> 01:35.293
you unhook babycakes

01:35.669 --> 01:37.651
and my peoples be
down where you want us.

01:37.674 --> 01:38.390
Swear to god.

01:44.149 --> 01:46.701
Fuck with a man's ride,
you're gonna get his attention.

01:46.808 --> 01:47.500
Babycakes ?

01:47.535 --> 01:48.661
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.

01:52.649 --> 01:55.159
Motherfuckers gonna hear
from my motherfuckin' lawyer.

01:55.238 --> 01:57.184
This right here
is some outrageous shit.

01:57.207 --> 01:57.759
You think ?

01:59.940 --> 02:01.477
Fuck y'all lyin' motherfuckers.

02:05.489 --> 02:06.016
Gentlemen.

02:17.786 --> 02:19.252
That is outrageous.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.789
Come on, sweetheart.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.110
Bust your ass out of here.

03:07.587 --> 03:08.690
Still Maryland.

03:09.558 --> 03:12.429
But if y'all don't take that shit
down to Hamsterdam tomorrow

03:12.500 --> 03:14.294
the next time
it's gonna be West Virginia.

03:14.576 --> 03:16.828
That little star right there ?
Across from the dipper ?

03:17.168 --> 03:18.001
That's north.

03:19.010 --> 03:20.543
You wanna go the other way.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.458
Assholes.

05:12.666 --> 05:13.844
Homecoming

05:45.261 --> 05:47.148
<i>Landfills, got Landfills.</i>

05:58.711 --> 06:01.409
<i>W.M.D. Got that W.M.D.</i>

06:07.082 --> 06:09.451
We'll start the interior
construction within the week.

06:09.475 --> 06:11.410
Which means we need
to readdress the budget.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.091
Readdress how ?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.448
Well, for one, the price
of steel has doubled.

06:14.471 --> 06:16.055
It'll triple
if we don't buy it now.

06:16.078 --> 06:18.589
- Ain't the steel bought already ?
- Not the bulk of it, no.

06:18.608 --> 06:21.881
And then there are the gutting costs.
They exceeded our original expectations.

06:21.893 --> 06:23.816
He needs to wear
the hat when he's on-site.

06:23.852 --> 06:25.013
Code, you know.

06:27.157 --> 06:28.483
Gutting costs went up, huh ?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.066
That was due to your modifications.

06:30.091 --> 06:32.073
The changes you asked for
in those loft units.

06:32.097 --> 06:33.656
Necessitating new permits.

06:33.669 --> 06:34.912
Which means another delay.

06:34.946 --> 06:35.800
Unless we expedite.

06:35.822 --> 06:38.275
Bring the architect and his
people back in over the weekend

06:38.297 --> 06:40.034
and get something
to the city on monday.

06:40.045 --> 06:41.898
Whoa, man, that part
of his original fee ?

06:41.910 --> 06:43.236
No, this was unanticipated.

06:43.354 --> 06:46.200
Look, y'all fucked up,
so y'all supposed to take the hit, right ?

06:46.259 --> 06:47.197
Excuse me ?

06:47.267 --> 06:49.707
I mean, my man here don't know
shit about no gutting costs

06:49.731 --> 06:51.877
he don't know nothing
about no price of no steel.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.707
He just tryin'
to get some shit built

06:54.397 --> 06:56.720
and y'all supposed to have
expertise behind this.

06:56.801 --> 06:58.937
Only what I'm sayin' is
it seem like the expertise

06:58.959 --> 07:00.403
ain't where it supposed to be.

07:00.484 --> 07:01.710
Unfortunately, Mr. Barksdale

07:01.721 --> 07:03.750
cost overruns are
the nature of the business.

07:04.185 --> 07:05.874
We should discuss
this over lunch.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.809
Ah, hell no, man,
I got elsewhere to be.

07:13.561 --> 07:14.746
This is the Marlo kid.

07:14.805 --> 07:18.276
He's fresh blood for the organization.
Bell's given him the best real estate.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.511
The Barksdale people
took what they needed

07:20.512 --> 07:22.222
when the towers
came down, no problem.

07:22.258 --> 07:23.723
Stringer hasn't missed a step.

07:24.321 --> 07:25.611
He's still selling drugs.

07:25.671 --> 07:26.562
Lotta drugs.

07:26.796 --> 07:28.087
He's not dropping bodies.

07:28.158 --> 07:31.056
Nah, he doesn't need to.
He's got all the corners he needs.

07:31.889 --> 07:33.389
And I'm supposed to give a shit ?

07:33.471 --> 07:34.773
Lieutenant, two weeks

07:35.407 --> 07:36.662
Bell looked insulated

07:36.943 --> 07:40.017
like he had enough legitimate front
to be able to be just the bank.

07:40.298 --> 07:43.209
What Kima's found out is he's still
directly involved with the drugs.

07:43.281 --> 07:45.767
Otherwise, why the face-to-face
with the Stanfield kid ?

07:45.779 --> 07:47.714
He's still connected
to the day-to-day.

07:48.571 --> 07:51.020
We come back six, eight months

07:51.242 --> 07:53.271
you won't even get him
in a room talking drugs

07:53.295 --> 07:54.268
much less handling any.

07:54.315 --> 07:55.735
It's now or never, Lieutenant.

08:03.764 --> 08:05.158
Stringer Bell is quiet.

08:06.437 --> 08:07.846
And if he's quiet

08:08.303 --> 08:10.776
I don't give a fuck
if we come back a year from now

08:10.788 --> 08:13.146
and find out he's on
the greater Baltimore committee.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.574
This unit is about the bodies.

08:28.597 --> 08:31.365
<i>Major Forrester, call two-four-six-two.
Major Forrester.</i>

08:38.817 --> 08:40.166
What the fuck is this ?

08:40.671 --> 08:43.119
Ten-page report
on the heroic police work

08:44.150 --> 08:47.330
undertaken to retrieve officer
Dozerman's service weapon.

08:50.649 --> 08:54.332
Send that upstairs, keep the bosses
outta your ass for a while.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.655
You actually did all this ?

08:58.860 --> 09:00.045
Would it matter if I had ?

09:02.957 --> 09:03.426
Jay

09:05.619 --> 09:06.781
I'm a murder police

09:07.426 --> 09:08.834
I got a double on my plate.

09:09.924 --> 09:10.992
I'm gonna work it.

09:21.866 --> 09:23.883
We ain't got Fayette
and Poppleton neither ?

09:23.895 --> 09:24.702
What the fuck ?

09:24.761 --> 09:26.919
I'm workin' on it, man.
The avenue corners, too.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.690
What you mean
you workin' on it, man ?

09:28.714 --> 09:31.083
Why we ain't at least have
a shop setup down the block ?

09:31.119 --> 09:31.587
We did.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.476
There was a setback.

09:34.121 --> 09:35.458
Ran our boys off.

09:36.137 --> 09:36.559
Who ?

09:37.591 --> 09:39.186
- Just some player, man.
- Listen.

09:40.488 --> 09:42.870
Let him tell me.
We hire him for muscle.

09:43.022 --> 09:44.043
The boy, Marlo.

09:44.864 --> 09:48.052
Marlo, who the fuck is Marlo ?
He tied into one of the mobs ?

09:48.181 --> 09:49.108
Young boy.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.668
Runnin' it on his own, too.

09:50.844 --> 09:54.503
Got maybe 15 spots
along here and the avenue.

09:56.381 --> 09:58.504
An independent with
no fuckin' support ?

09:58.563 --> 10:01.203
Got all the prime real estate
and we doin' what exactly ?

10:03.466 --> 10:05.273
Young boy ran us
off the corner.

10:06.794 --> 10:08.941
I'm losing
my motherfuckin' mind, man.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.728
And I sincerely mean
your girl no disrespect but...

10:18.396 --> 10:21.446
Tosha wasn't killed because
she just happened by that mess.

10:21.540 --> 10:23.498
I think we all know that, right ?

10:24.718 --> 10:25.728
She was a player.

10:26.513 --> 10:27.463
We know that much.

10:28.532 --> 10:30.760
We got the science
that says she'd fired a gun

10:30.772 --> 10:31.804
when it all went down.

10:31.874 --> 10:33.994
Gun wasn't there for us to find

10:34.041 --> 10:36.375
but that just means someone
grabbed it up, right ?

10:37.126 --> 10:38.990
I mean, your girl she, uh...

10:39.988 --> 10:41.473
definitely had her say

10:41.920 --> 10:44.125
when everybody else
on that street was talking.

10:45.215 --> 10:46.201
Am I wrong ?

10:49.297 --> 10:51.311
Well, I got witnesses
on the scene that said

10:51.323 --> 10:53.622
she was there right in
the middle of a drug robbery.

10:53.657 --> 10:55.733
Boy by the name a' Omar
was in on it, too.

10:57.141 --> 10:58.912
Nobody saying Tosha was an angel.

11:00.042 --> 11:01.098
Nobody saying that.

11:04.969 --> 11:06.295
But what are they saying ?

11:07.445 --> 11:08.923
The crew Tosha was runnin' with

11:08.946 --> 11:11.468
maybe they didn't throw
the shot that killed her.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.162
But if they don't come to me
early and tell the true story

11:14.245 --> 11:17.095
I guarantee they won't
breathe a free breath

11:17.118 --> 11:19.370
until them cicadas come back.

11:26.069 --> 11:27.745
Y'all get the word
to the right people.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.218
And you've spoken to
the medical examiner, correct ?

11:39.370 --> 11:40.051
What's he say ?

11:41.384 --> 11:42.569
He says it's lumpy.

11:44.000 --> 11:44.715
Lumpy ?

11:45.314 --> 11:48.247
He says if an investigation
can come up with a credible scenario

11:48.270 --> 11:50.792
he's willing to change
the cause of death to homicide.

11:50.839 --> 11:52.630
Do you even have a suspect here ?

11:55.939 --> 11:57.956
Look, I don't know
how you city guys do it.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.525
But down here in Annapolis,
we try to duck a punch or two.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.020
Not lean into every last one.

12:03.087 --> 12:04.988
My county doesn't
need another murder.

12:27.045 --> 12:28.382
I'm glad you could came.

12:30.277 --> 12:31.872
Ladies, Reverend Wright

12:31.883 --> 12:34.053
I'd like you to meet
my husband, Cedric Daniels.

12:34.077 --> 12:34.840
Nice to meet you.

12:35.461 --> 12:36.553
Not that I've seen, no.

12:37.609 --> 12:39.531
- She was invited, right ?
- Oh, of course.

12:39.779 --> 12:41.750
Eunetta doesn't make it
too much nowadays.

12:41.820 --> 12:42.982
Not even council meetings.

12:43.533 --> 12:46.606
I think Eunetta's gonna have her
hands full come the primary.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.538
Mayor will pull her through.

12:50.371 --> 12:51.520
He still have coattails ?

12:51.638 --> 12:52.939
Sheeeeet, boy.

12:53.304 --> 12:55.509
You look up incumbent
in the damn dictionary

12:55.531 --> 12:58.300
and you'll see Clarence
Royce smiling back at you.

12:58.804 --> 13:00.353
He gets his whole ticket through.

13:00.634 --> 13:03.554
Mayor's got a new poll
showing his negatives

13:03.938 --> 13:05.897
they've really jumped
in the last year.

13:06.754 --> 13:09.722
Not that he's gonna be putting
a press release out about that.

13:10.591 --> 13:12.866
I hear you took a swipe
at Hizzoner the other day

13:12.902 --> 13:14.062
on that witness murder.

13:14.098 --> 13:15.318
Not at the mayor directly.

13:15.752 --> 13:18.509
But we had the police brass in
front of the subcommittee and

13:19.493 --> 13:21.836
I dunno, there's just
no excuse for what happened.

13:22.153 --> 13:23.631
You keep on it, Councilman.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.449
A little smack here and there

13:25.473 --> 13:27.432
does this administration
a world of good.

13:29.402 --> 13:31.479
That's why we need
new blood on the Council.

13:32.221 --> 13:34.203
Keep everybody honest.

13:52.027 --> 13:53.329
Don't embarrass yourself.

13:56.907 --> 13:57.434
So...

13:59.334 --> 14:01.317
your murder's never
gonna be a murder

14:01.341 --> 14:03.612
and Daniels's got his head
all up in another case.

14:04.868 --> 14:07.085
You know what the hardest part
of being a police is ?

14:08.809 --> 14:10.342
Yeah, explaining to your wife why

14:10.377 --> 14:12.888
she has to take antibiotics
for your kidney infection.

14:16.664 --> 14:19.244
I was gonna say trying to make
the job actually matter.

14:19.750 --> 14:20.279
That too.

14:23.844 --> 14:26.308
Speaking of your ex wife,
what's up there ?

14:26.638 --> 14:27.236
Nothing.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.274
She's got her hooks in some lawyer.

14:30.991 --> 14:31.742
Money guy.

14:32.398 --> 14:33.642
Fuck it and fuck her.

14:34.815 --> 14:36.000
So what, you movin' on ?

14:40.221 --> 14:42.903
Yeah, I might have some fresh
hope, now that you mention it.

14:46.035 --> 14:49.154
Yeah, there's this woman
at this thing for my kids.

14:50.288 --> 14:52.634
She, like, raises money
for the school and all that.

14:52.658 --> 14:53.057
You know.

14:54.206 --> 14:57.198
She's got a face, a body and
a brain all working together.

14:57.221 --> 14:59.626
And she looks
like the kind who might

15:00.142 --> 15:02.873
tell me when my shit stinks,
which is probably what I need.

15:04.374 --> 15:06.017
She's kinda like Freamon with tits.

15:08.399 --> 15:09.959
So what, you get her number ?

15:10.369 --> 15:11.679
No, not exactly.

15:11.983 --> 15:14.107
Hey, what kinda detective
would I be if I couldn't

15:14.129 --> 15:16.006
track a white woman
in Baltimore, right ?

15:19.466 --> 15:20.182
There you go.

15:29.457 --> 15:31.123
You were so smooth tonight.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.007
You had them eating
right out of your hand.

15:36.193 --> 15:37.893
It's what you need from me, right ?

15:40.497 --> 15:41.740
Anyway, it wasn't too bad.

15:42.807 --> 15:44.478
I'm getting better at it, I guess.

15:44.948 --> 15:45.523
You are.

15:54.797 --> 15:56.674
Cedric. Maybe we could...

15:58.797 --> 15:59.524
I don't know.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.388
Right now

16:05.573 --> 16:07.473
you tell me where you need me

16:07.919 --> 16:10.587
and whether you want the class
"a" or the class "b" uniform.

16:10.599 --> 16:11.314
And I'm there.

16:17.296 --> 16:18.878
More than that, I just don't know.

16:27.668 --> 16:28.090
So.

16:31.164 --> 16:31.551
So.

16:33.986 --> 16:35.020
I'm sayin' what the fuck ?

16:39.148 --> 16:40.379
Take a deep breath, man.

16:42.198 --> 16:44.002
I mean take a long deep breath

16:44.212 --> 16:46.241
and know that if you call the shot,
we at war

16:46.734 --> 16:47.473
we at war.

16:47.778 --> 16:49.373
I'm there like I always been.

16:55.729 --> 16:57.875
Thing about turf, man,
it ain't like it was.

16:59.153 --> 17:02.122
I mean you ain't got to pay
no price of buying no corners.

17:05.815 --> 17:08.840
Since when do we buy corners ?

17:09.532 --> 17:10.952
We take corners.

17:11.844 --> 17:13.662
Man, you gonna buy
one way or another.

17:14.202 --> 17:17.042
Whether it's the bodies that
we done lost or you gonna lose

17:17.795 --> 17:20.175
time in the joint that's
behind us or ahead of us.

17:20.188 --> 17:22.463
I mean, you gonna
get some shit in this game

17:22.486 --> 17:24.046
but it ain't shit for free.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.289
I mean how many
corners do we need ?

17:31.344 --> 17:32.646
How much money can a nigger make ?

17:32.728 --> 17:34.277
More than a nigger can spend.

17:34.336 --> 17:37.148
And we ain't gonna be around
to spend what we done made already.

17:37.229 --> 17:39.693
Shit, I didn't think I was
gonna be around this long.

17:42.988 --> 17:44.044
Well, we here now.

17:45.597 --> 17:48.306
The fact is we got
every mob in town :

17:48.341 --> 17:50.358
Eastside, Westside,
ready to pull together

17:51.320 --> 17:54.393
share territory on that good shit
that Prop Joe puttin' out there.

17:54.425 --> 17:56.934
We take the shit downtown
and we get in the money game

17:56.935 --> 17:58.554
that niggers ain't going to jail.

18:00.337 --> 18:02.491
I mean, we past
that run and gun shit, man.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.884
Like we fund us a package

18:04.920 --> 18:06.866
and we ain't got to see
nothing but bank.

18:07.288 --> 18:09.799
Nothing but cash.
No corners, no territory, nothing.

18:10.772 --> 18:13.369
We make so much got-damn
straight money, man.

18:13.768 --> 18:15.282
The government come after us, man

18:16.290 --> 18:17.792
ain't shit they can say.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.891
Businessmen, huh ?

18:21.486 --> 18:24.521
Let the younguns
worry about how to retail

18:26.013 --> 18:27.020
we're the wholesale.

18:28.382 --> 18:31.092
I mean, who gives a fuck
who's standing on what corner

18:31.420 --> 18:33.411
if we're taking
that shit off the top

18:34.385 --> 18:35.745
putting that shit to good use

18:36.449 --> 18:38.021
makin' that shit work for us ?

18:39.511 --> 18:41.106
We could run more than corners, B.

18:42.080 --> 18:42.666
Period.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.724
We could do like
Little Willie, man

18:46.725 --> 18:48.824
back in the day,
with all that number money.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.017
And run this got-damn city.

18:58.940 --> 19:00.079
Like businessmen.

19:05.856 --> 19:09.164
Man, just lemme talk to the boy, Marlo,
see if I can't smooth this shit out.

19:09.187 --> 19:10.693
I mean it ain't gonna be overnight

19:10.694 --> 19:12.618
cuz the nigger already
knows what he knows.

19:14.306 --> 19:15.255
But I think I could

19:15.749 --> 19:17.015
talk some sense in his head.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.181
Yeah, I ain't no suitman,
businessman, like you.

19:25.718 --> 19:27.935
You know, I'm just
a gangster, I suppose.

19:29.865 --> 19:31.015
And I want my corners.

19:39.194 --> 19:40.273
<i>I've gotta tell ya</i>

19:41.295 --> 19:42.408
<i>I'm having a tough time </i>

19:42.432 --> 19:44.955
<i>wrapping my head around the
reality of you being paroled.</i>

19:45.365 --> 19:48.579
<i>Trust me, I won't fully comprehend it
until I'm sipping my first martini.</i>

19:51.373 --> 19:52.324
<i>Toby, I'm...</i>

19:54.482 --> 19:56.452
Homide police
went to Tosha's people.

19:56.605 --> 19:59.021
Talking about how
they know she was in the mix.

19:59.150 --> 20:02.362
Sayin' they got witnesses an' shit.
They called your name on it, too.

20:08.061 --> 20:09.800
- So what they say ?
- They called me.

20:10.784 --> 20:12.462
Hey, yo, I know this cop, man.

20:13.248 --> 20:14.539
Maybe we should help him out.

20:15.394 --> 20:16.637
Tell him who did what.

20:16.709 --> 20:18.140
Yo, stop wallin', Kimmy.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.981
A-ight, now I said I got this.

20:20.051 --> 20:22.893
Tosha's people want to know from me
exactly what happened that day.

20:22.929 --> 20:23.867
That's all I'm saying.

20:23.879 --> 20:26.554
Well tell 'em she caught one tryin'
to take the boys down, man.

20:26.566 --> 20:28.830
Ain't no need to involve
the police in none of this.

20:28.841 --> 20:30.472
Sound to me like
he involved already.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.981
Kimmy, I told you, I got this.

20:32.838 --> 20:33.647
<i>Time !</i>

20:34.656 --> 20:35.289
<i>Asshole.</i>

20:46.631 --> 20:50.056
My husband worked for
Mr. Cooper at the american can.

20:50.631 --> 20:51.862
He made good money.

20:52.524 --> 20:54.729
We saved up and bought this house.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.941
There were some white families
still living in the neighborhood then.

20:59.023 --> 21:01.297
The neighborhood
has changed, Mrs. Hazel.

21:02.275 --> 21:04.834
This is a picture of the house.

21:10.194 --> 21:13.150
City owned, taxes paid and all.

21:13.493 --> 21:14.959
It is very nice.

21:17.387 --> 21:18.713
But I can't afford that.

21:18.782 --> 21:20.624
You don't have
to worry about the money.

21:20.871 --> 21:22.032
It's all taken care of.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.844
This is a special program we have.

21:25.078 --> 21:31.295
It's for people who are living
in really bad situations

21:31.905 --> 21:34.063
with the drug trafficking
you see outside.

21:35.424 --> 21:38.826
And this is a good neighborhood.

21:39.588 --> 21:42.673
It's safe and it's on
the number 19 line.

21:44.691 --> 21:46.418
And it's walkin'
distance from your church.

21:47.426 --> 21:51.601
Officer, this is
the only home I know.

21:51.883 --> 21:53.384
It's all I got.

21:53.818 --> 21:58.178
Now you say you have a program
that can place me somewhere else.

21:58.389 --> 22:01.556
But you ain't got no program
for what's outside my door ?

22:15.572 --> 22:16.627
You weren't lying.

22:19.803 --> 22:20.307
I told you.

22:20.331 --> 22:22.665
And I've been all over
these blocks like you said.

22:23.251 --> 22:25.305
I haven't seen any cameras,
nobody peekin'.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.581
And monk man
and his crew been here

22:28.604 --> 22:31.114
for grindin' for days
and knockers ain't even blinked.

22:31.665 --> 22:32.405
Tell you what.

22:33.883 --> 22:36.122
Send my people over.
Not too many.

22:36.181 --> 22:37.390
Just some of the younguns.

22:37.591 --> 22:40.910
Keep the package real small,
in case it's a trap.

22:41.262 --> 22:43.209
I'ma hear directly
from you on this.

22:44.077 --> 22:44.616
I'm on it.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.051
Shit is just bugged out, you know ?

22:56.654 --> 22:58.852
String called, said to tell you
he's gonna be late

22:58.865 --> 23:01.011
behind something he needed
to see down the way.

23:06.537 --> 23:07.886
So what you tellin' me we weak ?

23:07.943 --> 23:09.704
Boss, I reached out to Black Donnie.

23:11.392 --> 23:14.373
Okay, spit it out, man.
Listen, stop fucking double talkin' me.

23:15.957 --> 23:18.151
Black Donnie said
he ain't having any of it.

23:18.327 --> 23:20.720
Said Brother Mouzone
put a hex on all of us.

23:22.033 --> 23:22.973
What 'bout Peacock ?

23:23.323 --> 23:25.752
Peacock when a hired
out some dominicans.

23:27.046 --> 23:28.113
What about Eggy Mule ?

23:28.500 --> 23:29.263
Eggy locked up.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.562
Caught a nickel
with the feds for a pistol.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.178
How 'bout Shorty Boyd ?

23:35.703 --> 23:38.174
Shorty Boyd went
and cleaned his whole ack' up.

23:40.567 --> 23:42.643
Yeah, I know. Fucked us all up.

23:43.934 --> 23:44.814
What we got ?

23:46.245 --> 23:49.354
Soldier you sent at us, Cutty,
he gonna work out

23:49.526 --> 23:51.871
but the rest of them dudes,
I dunno.

23:52.916 --> 23:54.030
A-ight, listen big man,

23:54.101 --> 23:56.634
you about to earn your fuckin'
keep around here right now.

23:57.111 --> 23:58.565
You go out, you get Cutty

23:58.646 --> 24:01.251
and get the best of the rest
and put a hurtin' on Marlo.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.542
I want my corners.

24:08.598 --> 24:09.290
Fuck.

24:11.589 --> 24:12.304
What now ?

24:12.469 --> 24:13.383
Problems, Mr. Bell.

24:13.407 --> 24:15.284
Naw, this ain't
the time for problems, man.

24:15.307 --> 24:16.116
I got places to be.

24:16.140 --> 24:17.947
We're being told it
may take weeks before

24:17.957 --> 24:19.703
we can get the city
inspectors back down

24:19.714 --> 24:20.748
here to approve these site changes.

24:20.771 --> 24:21.253
Weeks ?

24:21.394 --> 24:23.013
Every day we wait, you lose money.

24:23.180 --> 24:23.875
What the fuck ?

24:23.898 --> 24:26.009
How does anybody make
any money in this game ?

24:26.046 --> 24:28.402
Every time I think we good,
y'all back in my pockets.

24:35.132 --> 24:36.305
You need to make a call.

24:36.715 --> 24:37.220
Again ?

24:38.182 --> 24:39.554
He's the consultant, right ?

24:39.636 --> 24:42.521
You're paying him a nice chunk
of change to consult, right ?

24:43.365 --> 24:45.391
This is why we have
a politically connected guy

24:45.415 --> 24:46.447
like that on the payroll.

24:46.647 --> 24:49.708
He goes downtown and does for us
what we can't do for ourselves.

24:51.725 --> 24:53.227
Democracy in action, Mr. Bell.

24:58.585 --> 24:59.441
A-ight, look.

24:59.816 --> 25:01.876
Me and Slim, we gonna
work through the alleys

25:01.899 --> 25:03.079
and hit 'em from this side.

25:03.831 --> 25:06.436
I want you, to come through here.

25:07.826 --> 25:08.811
Slow down.

25:09.469 --> 25:10.302
Through the intersection.

25:10.371 --> 25:13.034
Hold, why don't
we just come up this way

25:13.058 --> 25:15.697
then we don't have to worry
'bout crossin' no intersection.

25:15.919 --> 25:17.057
Come that way.

25:17.690 --> 25:20.024
You puttin' your driver
in the line of fire, man.

25:20.610 --> 25:21.396
Think on it.

25:21.831 --> 25:23.156
He gettin' taken out.

25:23.648 --> 25:24.938
Car gonna crash.

25:25.455 --> 25:26.617
Now, where that put you at ?

25:26.628 --> 25:29.604
Besides you don't wanna be shooting
cross your driver, do you ?

25:30.917 --> 25:32.536
A-ight, so come in easy.

25:33.145 --> 25:36.431
They ain't gonna be lookin' for you
'cause we gonna have their full attention.

25:36.465 --> 25:39.754
Hey, look, pick your targets,
drop 'em and move out quick.

25:40.024 --> 25:40.728
Who drivin' ?

25:40.787 --> 25:41.784
I'm under the wheel.

25:41.936 --> 25:43.497
Alright, you make sure
you slow down

25:43.509 --> 25:45.491
at the end of the block
and toss your weapons.

25:45.562 --> 25:49.008
And get rid of any shell casings
that kick back in the car.

25:49.255 --> 25:50.697
Poh-leece can trace them shits.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.059
Toss the gloves too, right ?

25:52.211 --> 25:53.443
Naw, hold on to them.

25:53.688 --> 25:55.930
They gonna have
that D.N.A. Shit all on 'em.

25:56.258 --> 25:58.883
Alright, look, it's gonna
take us some time to get set up

25:59.153 --> 26:02.097
soe need ya'll to lay back
'bout four, five blocks.

26:02.390 --> 26:04.853
And when we ready, we're
gonna hit you on the burner.

26:05.158 --> 26:07.714
Which y'all hold t'til I call you.
You got it ?

26:08.137 --> 26:09.521
We gonna handle our end.

26:09.876 --> 26:12.446
You just make sure some fuckin'
way left out there for us.

26:13.067 --> 26:15.554
'Cause I don't wanna feel
like I'm just someamn decoy.

26:15.718 --> 26:16.832
Damn right about that.

26:19.308 --> 26:21.533
It's just a relocate, no big deal.

26:21.908 --> 26:23.857
I'm not asking for
round-the-clock protection

26:23.868 --> 26:24.772
or anything like that.

26:24.807 --> 26:25.522
No big deal ?

26:26.214 --> 26:27.458
Come on, Bunny, where the fuck

26:27.470 --> 26:29.370
am I gonna find a house
for this old broad ?

26:29.393 --> 26:30.354
I got one already.

26:30.918 --> 26:32.507
It's a foreclosure
up off the harford road.

26:32.542 --> 26:34.582
All you gotta do is file
the emergency petition

26:34.594 --> 26:35.919
my boys will move her in.

26:38.453 --> 26:40.601
She's witnessing against
a violent drug crew.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.624
Without her cooperation,
I doubt if it'll go forward.

26:43.647 --> 26:44.832
She's 73 years old.

26:46.486 --> 26:48.621
She's a brave old broad
to be doing this, I guess.

26:48.644 --> 26:49.488
C'mon, Ray.

26:49.888 --> 26:52.210
Look, we just lost
a witness in a drug case.

26:52.281 --> 26:54.213
We don't wanna
lose another one so quick.

26:58.822 --> 27:01.227
If Rawls gets wind of this,
you forged my signature.

27:03.619 --> 27:04.944
Where's she living now, anyway ?

27:04.968 --> 27:06.739
She's on Vincent Street, sector two.

27:07.314 --> 27:08.311
Bad location, huh ?

27:08.968 --> 27:10.200
You wouldn't believe it.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.593
We should wait for the call.

27:18.932 --> 27:20.539
Man, what if that
crew got lookouts ?

27:20.575 --> 27:23.285
Motherfucker, if we wait, it'll
be all over time we get there.

27:23.891 --> 27:25.041
Plus, look I'm sayin'

27:25.415 --> 27:26.952
how's that gonna play with Avon

27:27.691 --> 27:28.922
they takin' all the credit.

27:41.795 --> 27:42.851
Yo, fellas, strap up.

27:55.805 --> 27:57.845
There go that
motherfucker Nay-Nay, man.

27:58.467 --> 27:59.335
I say we take him.

27:59.394 --> 28:00.706
We should wait for the call.

28:00.707 --> 28:02.385
Man, we wait,
he gonna get away, man.

28:07.208 --> 28:07.970
Go, go, go.

28:16.388 --> 28:17.420
Get out, get out !

28:35.665 --> 28:36.592
What the fuck.

28:43.743 --> 28:46.640
Didn't I say something about waiting
for a fucking phone call.

29:01.196 --> 29:02.288
You know how you blow-off

29:02.312 --> 29:04.293
half the invitations
you get to be somewhere ?

29:04.304 --> 29:07.026
Ribbon cuttings,
playground clean-ups and shit ?

29:07.296 --> 29:08.293
I got to, no choice.

29:08.586 --> 29:10.391
I was gonna cut out
on one the other day,

29:10.403 --> 29:12.551
it was a fundraiser
for the delta phis, you know ?

29:12.573 --> 29:14.772
But I drag-ass over to the forum
to show the flag

29:14.784 --> 29:16.967
and who's there in his ironsides
but Odell Watkins.

29:17.635 --> 29:18.948
The rainmaker himself.

29:18.972 --> 29:20.655
Yeah, talking in public about

29:20.667 --> 29:22.608
being kinda disappointed
in the Mayor.

29:24.631 --> 29:26.414
Disappointed, yeah ?

29:27.188 --> 29:27.925
Like how ?

29:28.043 --> 29:30.260
Like sincerely disappointed...

29:30.835 --> 29:32.675
the way you'd be
with one of your kids.

29:32.699 --> 29:34.775
Like he really wanted to see
the Mayor pressed, you know ?

29:35.577 --> 29:36.539
Got me thinking.

29:36.985 --> 29:39.624
Maybe somebody can take a run
at Royce in next year's primary.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.296
Like who ?

29:40.730 --> 29:41.927
Madame Council President ?

29:43.405 --> 29:45.141
Or Mickey Pepper
would give him a fight.

29:45.165 --> 29:47.734
Mick's already said he doesn't
want to leave the legislature.

29:47.745 --> 29:48.496
He won't risk it.

29:49.095 --> 29:51.433
Well, you gotta
have someone with balls.

29:51.680 --> 29:52.794
And somebody black.

29:54.471 --> 29:56.055
This being Baltimore and all.

30:03.067 --> 30:04.041
How many y'all take ?

30:04.627 --> 30:05.073
Two.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.122
Didn't get nary a shot off.

30:09.894 --> 30:11.959
Speak to the quality
of Barksdale's people.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.549
He gonna have to come back at you.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.140
You know it ain't gonna stop at this.

30:16.281 --> 30:17.325
I don't want it to stop.

30:17.923 --> 30:19.473
Barksdale weak today.

30:22.311 --> 30:24.347
They ain't working
with the ammunition I got.

30:25.121 --> 30:26.834
No doubt, you carryin'
a full clip.

30:27.479 --> 30:30.330
But what you gonna do when you sittin'
at the head of the table ?

30:30.365 --> 30:33.098
Once you there,
you got to hold it down.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.080
Sound like one
of them good problems.

30:39.250 --> 30:43.332
Prisons and graveyards
full of boys who wore the crown.

30:43.848 --> 30:45.030
Point is, they wore it.

30:45.652 --> 30:47.130
It's my turn to wear it now.

30:50.238 --> 30:51.517
We're gonna do this, right, Chris ?

30:51.951 --> 30:54.401
- We gonna do this, son.
- It's ready yesterday, dawg.

30:56.734 --> 30:57.624
White t's, man ?

30:58.410 --> 30:59.923
Need to get yourself some white t's.

31:03.842 --> 31:05.402
So you workin'
your plan, huh, Bubs ?

31:05.871 --> 31:07.308
Dollar here, dollar there, Kima.

31:08.727 --> 31:10.006
So, what's up ? Why you call ?

31:10.862 --> 31:11.824
Jus' checkin' in.

31:12.199 --> 31:14.299
You still interested
in the boy Marlo, right ?

31:15.871 --> 31:16.258
No ?

31:17.297 --> 31:18.435
You wanna keep gettin' paid

31:18.447 --> 31:20.341
you need to get your ass
up to park heights

31:20.351 --> 31:23.061
school yourself on a jamaican
named Kintel got them corners.

31:24.112 --> 31:24.768
Kintel, huh ?

31:25.813 --> 31:27.712
My bosses don't
give a fuck about Marlo.

31:27.818 --> 31:29.179
Stringer's people neither.

31:30.105 --> 31:30.844
That's too bad.

31:31.408 --> 31:31.959
Yeah.

31:32.545 --> 31:34.244
'Cause now we got
a whole lot of drama.

31:34.267 --> 31:34.924
What happened ?

31:35.358 --> 31:37.504
That young buck, Marlo,
ain't gettin' runned off.

31:37.540 --> 31:39.816
He jus' dropped two Barksdale
soldiers on the corner

31:39.839 --> 31:41.517
of Mount and Fayette
a few hours past.

31:41.529 --> 31:41.858
What ?

31:42.773 --> 31:44.251
Corners all jumpin' bad.

31:44.673 --> 31:46.657
I thought Marlo
had them corners for Stringer.

31:46.668 --> 31:48.721
- We saw them meet.
- I don't know what you saw

31:48.732 --> 31:50.855
all I know is Marlo
is flying his own colors.

31:51.231 --> 31:53.283
Westside about
to be all Baghdad an' shit.

31:55.077 --> 31:57.033
But ya'll looking
for jake, what's his name ?

31:57.057 --> 31:57.456
Kintel ?

31:57.890 --> 31:59.274
Y'all too fickle for Bubs, man.

31:59.308 --> 31:59.896
I swear.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.813
A little gift for you and your boys.

32:04.247 --> 32:04.818
Call me.

32:06.754 --> 32:08.314
Whitey sale ! Whitey sale !

32:10.213 --> 32:12.935
Deputy, I am aware of the
incident and my men are on it.

32:13.533 --> 32:15.887
We called in the seven-to-three
flex squad early

32:15.922 --> 32:17.155
and my D.E.U. is canvassing.

32:17.764 --> 32:18.855
<i>And what do we know ?</i>

32:19.958 --> 32:22.105
Only that it seems to be rival gangs.

32:22.621 --> 32:23.736
What does homicide have ?

32:23.765 --> 32:25.050
<i>Fuck homicide.</i>

32:25.218 --> 32:27.236
<i>I'm asking you
for answers right now, Major.</i>

32:27.283 --> 32:28.269
Sir, my men..

32:28.291 --> 32:29.841
<i>And you damn sure have none.</i>

32:29.852 --> 32:31.142
My men are out there...

32:36.938 --> 32:39.119
What do we know that we
can actually tell the man ?

32:39.154 --> 32:40.574
Like you said, rival gangs.

32:40.597 --> 32:41.641
Which gangs ?

32:42.320 --> 32:42.990
Gangs.

32:43.319 --> 32:44.961
Assholes who don't like each other.

32:50.855 --> 32:52.978
I'm sorry, Major.
But we got nothin' on it.

33:04.807 --> 33:07.270
Play it. It don't make me
no never mind.

33:07.396 --> 33:08.464
It's all 'bout trumps.

33:14.481 --> 33:15.396
Evenin', omar.

33:18.018 --> 33:18.898
Evenin', Bruiser.

33:24.798 --> 33:26.358
Speakin' 'of them trumps now.

33:34.269 --> 33:35.055
Hey, everybody.

33:38.093 --> 33:39.818
What's for dinner, Jen ?
I'm starvin'.

33:40.558 --> 33:41.390
It's working.

33:46.958 --> 33:47.849
Hi, daddy.

33:48.870 --> 33:50.160
How you doin', beautiful ?

33:50.230 --> 33:51.521
Daddy, we shared with you.

33:53.186 --> 33:53.937
That's nice.

33:54.781 --> 33:57.207
Hey, Jen, you seen that tape
I was watchin' last night ?

33:57.217 --> 33:58.908
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:58.930 --> 33:59.822
You gotta see this.

34:00.314 --> 34:02.579
Videotape from last monday
night's council meeting.

34:02.613 --> 34:05.612
Keiffer tried to block my resolution
but I laid him out good.

34:05.788 --> 34:07.724
I was in rare form, baby.

34:08.263 --> 34:11.032
- You seen that tape ?
- Maybe you left it in the VCR.

34:13.984 --> 34:16.188
What... sonofabitch.

34:18.876 --> 34:19.764
Who the hell...

34:19.766 --> 34:21.960
Daddy, Franky shared
his sammitch with you.

34:22.466 --> 34:25.868
We hid it so no one else could
eat it before you came home.

34:34.652 --> 34:36.929
Could I get some chips
and pickles with that too ?

34:40.940 --> 34:42.440
I don't want to disrespect you.

34:44.822 --> 34:46.382
String been good to me, you know ?

34:47.110 --> 34:48.563
Not just my bills.

34:48.833 --> 34:51.166
Him and Avon probably
think they owe me that much.

34:52.643 --> 34:55.306
And it ain't what people might
be thinking or saying, either.

34:55.422 --> 34:56.596
What they saying, honey ?

34:57.206 --> 34:58.965
It ain't like I don't miss Dee.

35:00.281 --> 35:01.079
I do.

35:02.510 --> 35:05.290
Yeah, well, I miss him too

35:06.017 --> 35:07.612
but he's been gone a while now.

35:08.163 --> 35:09.136
More than a year.

35:11.975 --> 35:13.031
Stringer's fine

35:14.450 --> 35:15.518
no denying that.

35:18.462 --> 35:19.776
I feel safe around him.

35:22.931 --> 35:24.562
You asking to get with String

35:26.626 --> 35:27.517
I'm okay with that.

35:29.276 --> 35:30.626
Thought you was gonna be mad.

35:34.508 --> 35:37.558
I mean, everything with Dee
is so messed up, you know ?

35:38.121 --> 35:39.952
I mean, every time
I think about it...

35:41.418 --> 35:42.977
and you know this one police

35:43.482 --> 35:45.758
he came by here
and brought it all up again.

35:46.826 --> 35:47.318
Who did ?

35:47.963 --> 35:49.464
Police detective from the city.

35:50.297 --> 35:53.241
The one tried to turn Dee on Avon
when he got pulled up in Jersey.

35:54.660 --> 35:55.282
White boy ?

35:56.150 --> 35:57.370
- Bushy hair ?
- Yeah.

35:59.106 --> 35:59.763
What he say ?

36:02.320 --> 36:03.329
What he say ?

36:04.807 --> 36:09.534
He said maybe D'Angelo didn't take

36:10.847 --> 36:13.417
you know... take his own life.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.923
He said maybe
it was something else.

36:19.070 --> 36:20.338
And he came to you with it ?

36:21.289 --> 36:22.684
Left his card here one day

36:23.490 --> 36:25.132
but I didn't say
nothing to the man.

36:25.578 --> 36:26.798
Just told Stringer is all.

36:34.938 --> 36:36.709
She's gonna run for Council ?

36:37.448 --> 36:38.234
She is.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.131
Probably win, too, if I know her.

36:43.043 --> 36:44.498
And you're the proud husband ?

36:51.180 --> 36:53.198
Not sure how that makes me feel.

36:54.523 --> 36:56.928
It's just for show until
the election next year.

36:59.145 --> 37:01.339
A city police lieutenant
looks good on her arm.

37:02.265 --> 37:04.259
Who even cares anymore ?

37:04.808 --> 37:06.168
Half the country are separated

37:06.191 --> 37:08.643
the other half are getting
divorced for the second time.

37:08.654 --> 37:09.511
This is a favor.

37:10.179 --> 37:10.625
For her.

37:12.502 --> 37:13.546
It's hard to explain.

37:24.653 --> 37:26.436
Look, I disappointed her.

37:28.607 --> 37:30.448
She lived through me
for a lotta years

37:31.527 --> 37:33.815
telling herself I was tracked
for deputy commissioner

37:33.837 --> 37:36.054
at worst and past the police
department, who knows ?

37:37.686 --> 37:40.151
And there we were some things
that happened a long time ago

37:40.162 --> 37:41.091
when I was in Eastern.

37:43.276 --> 37:44.327
I guess she wanted more out of me

37:45.847 --> 37:48.200
and after a lot of years
and a lot of plans

37:49.315 --> 37:51.556
it turns out I have
a better head for police work

37:51.578 --> 37:53.173
than I do for climbing the ladder.

37:53.525 --> 37:55.251
She hung in there
thinking my career

37:55.262 --> 37:57.370
was going to turn
into some kind of big deal

37:57.710 --> 38:00.114
and I probably let her
believe it just to keep peace.

38:02.426 --> 38:04.020
Now she wants
to be the big deal.

38:07.246 --> 38:08.677
What do you want ?

38:14.765 --> 38:16.818
I just don't want
to disappoint her anymore

38:17.428 --> 38:18.155
and right now

38:18.939 --> 38:21.156
I'm more help showing up
at some chicken dinner

38:21.191 --> 38:22.785
in my wedding ring and dress blues

38:23.267 --> 38:25.355
then being the
not-even-divorced-yet husband

38:25.378 --> 38:26.832
with the white woman on his arm.

38:37.143 --> 38:38.691
I'm going to do what I can to see

38:38.715 --> 38:40.650
she gets what she
wants this time around.

38:42.715 --> 38:43.758
Nothing more than that.

38:45.294 --> 38:46.691
Last seen Gerard, man

38:46.714 --> 38:48.803
he was racin' bullets
up on Fayette Street.

38:49.225 --> 38:50.679
He appeared to be winnin', too.

38:50.785 --> 38:52.575
Look, man,
until he shows back up

38:52.599 --> 38:54.651
we ain't gonna know
what happened out there.

38:54.968 --> 38:57.080
I damn sure know one
fuckin' thing for sure.

38:57.467 --> 39:00.318
Two our people are chalked
and we ain't got shit to show for it.

39:00.365 --> 39:02.437
Man, police gonna
be real heavy on this, man.

39:02.461 --> 39:03.693
I say we slow down.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.628
Take our time
to build our muscle up...

39:05.652 --> 39:07.774
No, I ain't got no more
motherfuckin' time, man !

39:07.845 --> 39:10.085
When the word comes that this boy,
Marlo, punkin' me

39:10.109 --> 39:11.141
what am I look like ?

39:11.435 --> 39:13.158
I'm gonna go do this
shit my damn self.

39:13.182 --> 39:15.036
Naw, man, you just
this minute got home.

39:15.058 --> 39:16.793
Your name come up
in a murder beef, man

39:16.794 --> 39:17.968
they gonna pull your parole.

39:17.991 --> 39:19.035
Let me take care of this.

39:19.070 --> 39:21.111
We was thinkin', man,
me and Cutty, you know

39:21.135 --> 39:22.894
so we could hit
back at 'em ourselves.

39:22.918 --> 39:24.521
That way there
won't be no fuckups.

39:24.545 --> 39:27.173
Look, you two
niggers get on it, man.

39:28.990 --> 39:29.905
And get it right.

39:34.575 --> 39:36.698
You see how shit
had to be handled, man.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.433
The game is the fucking game.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.150
Period.

39:39.713 --> 39:40.921
Same as it ever was.

39:42.598 --> 39:44.522
I dunno though, man.
I mean...

39:50.903 --> 39:51.395
I mean...

39:52.122 --> 39:54.633
I dunno, I was just down the way
with one of our younguns

39:54.645 --> 39:56.346
on Vincent Street
where they got them

39:56.357 --> 39:58.000
you know, empty houses over there.

39:59.113 --> 40:00.544
And they got crews over there

40:01.143 --> 40:03.641
twirlin' dope and coke like
the shit was candy.

40:05.495 --> 40:08.263
Kids with a lemonade stand.
It's a different world down there.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.902
Like the cops just standing
around like that shit was...

40:11.981 --> 40:12.486
legal.

40:13.225 --> 40:15.794
I mean, every day.

40:17.178 --> 40:18.021
It actually was business.

40:25.025 --> 40:26.621
What you sayin', man.
What's up ?

40:31.102 --> 40:31.747
Nothin', man.

40:34.209 --> 40:34.844
Nothin' at all.

40:38.433 --> 40:40.451
Our C.I. tells us those
are Stringer's people.

40:40.462 --> 40:42.514
You want us to be about
the bodies, now we are.

40:42.902 --> 40:44.872
We had this kid, Marlo
working for Stringer

40:44.884 --> 40:45.881
but that might be wrong.

40:45.928 --> 40:47.734
He might be going
to war for those corners.

40:58.439 --> 40:59.623
Let me be clear :

41:00.397 --> 41:02.555
This is no longer
about Stringer Bell.

41:02.825 --> 41:05.089
Or Kintel fucking Williamson.
Or any of them.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.433
What is my rank, Detective Greggs ?

41:10.086 --> 41:10.837
My rank !

41:11.599 --> 41:12.409
Lieutenant, sir.

41:13.523 --> 41:15.353
What is my rank,
Detective McNulty ?

41:20.349 --> 41:21.964
If you can't
remember that much

41:21.989 --> 41:24.104
then you can go
the hell back to narcotics.

41:24.697 --> 41:27.514
And you can go to whatever the
hell unit will still have you.

41:28.416 --> 41:30.164
Now get the fuck out
of my office.

41:59.126 --> 42:00.649
Your message said you'd be here.

42:03.183 --> 42:04.533
Still, I kinda thought it'd be

42:04.557 --> 42:06.644
one of your minions
showed up in the flesh.

42:08.099 --> 42:10.057
You called on some
of my people's people.

42:12.544 --> 42:13.249
I'm just workin'.

42:15.617 --> 42:17.365
Doin' what a man is supposed to do.

42:18.269 --> 42:19.508
Well, I know you been busy.

42:20.717 --> 42:24.178
Caught some talk from the young men
you rousted over there on the Westside.

42:26.254 --> 42:28.306
That was about a gun,
belonged to a police.

42:29.866 --> 42:31.813
Yeah, caught some
talk about that, too.

42:34.511 --> 42:37.232
This here's about something else.

42:38.253 --> 42:41.498
Girl by the name of Tosha,
got her head blowed off in a firefight.

42:47.070 --> 42:49.639
If you're not here to cooperate,
then why are you here ?

42:53.603 --> 42:56.430
Okay, I could just pull up
that other girl from your squad.

42:57.710 --> 42:59.071
She ain't gonna talk to you.

42:59.540 --> 43:01.006
Ain't nobody gonna talk to you.

43:01.393 --> 43:03.317
I just came here
to make that clear, man.

43:03.423 --> 43:04.255
Ain't no thing.

43:05.428 --> 43:07.200
'Cause I already
got me an eyeball wit.

43:07.726 --> 43:08.255
You do ?

43:09.534 --> 43:10.742
I dunno 'bout that.

43:11.024 --> 43:13.862
Old Bruiser, he be blind behind
that fortified half the time.

43:14.820 --> 43:17.682
Shit, you gonna have to dry him out
just to get him on the stand.

43:18.246 --> 43:20.791
'Sides, he done had
a change o' heart to that story.

43:21.412 --> 43:22.668
That's what I heard, anyway.

43:23.801 --> 43:26.417
An' past that, you gonna have to call
this one of them

43:27.579 --> 43:28.857
cost-of-doin'-business things

43:28.892 --> 43:30.886
you all police be talkin'
about all the time.

43:31.062 --> 43:31.755
Ya feel me ?

43:32.516 --> 43:33.677
No taxpayers.

43:33.912 --> 43:35.460
Shit, way y'all lookin' at things

43:35.719 --> 43:37.280
ain't no victim to even speak of.

43:37.502 --> 43:39.168
Bullshit, boy. No victim ?!

43:39.285 --> 43:41.303
I just came from
Tosha's people, remember ?

43:41.350 --> 43:43.168
All this death,
you don't think that ripples out ?

43:43.426 --> 43:45.898
You don't even know what
the fuck I'm talkin' about.

43:49.861 --> 43:51.797
I was a few years
ahead of you at Emondson.

43:51.810 --> 43:54.190
But I know you remember
the neighborhood, how it was.

43:57.369 --> 43:59.081
We had some bad boys for real.

44:01.287 --> 44:02.424
Wasn't about guns

44:03.282 --> 44:05.404
so much as knowin'
what to do with your hands.

44:06.260 --> 44:07.855
Those boys could real rack it.

44:14.154 --> 44:14.823
My father...

44:17.228 --> 44:18.320
had me on the straight.

44:20.897 --> 44:23.208
But like any young man
I wanted to be hard, too.

44:24.134 --> 44:27.255
So I'd turn up at all the house parties
where the tough boys hung.

44:29.013 --> 44:30.761
Shit, they knew
I wasn't one of them.

44:34.796 --> 44:36.814
Them hardcases would
come up to me and say :

44:36.837 --> 44:39.007
"go home, schoolboy,
you don't belong here."

44:42.596 --> 44:45.200
Didn't realize at the time
what they were doin' for me.

44:50.385 --> 44:52.238
As rough as that
neighborhood could be

44:54.519 --> 44:56.114
we had us a community.

44:56.571 --> 44:58.836
Nobody, no victim,
who didn't matter.

44:59.564 --> 45:04.511
And now all we got is bodies,
and predatory motherfuckers like you.

45:05.285 --> 45:09.073
And out where that girl fell,
I saw kids actin' like Omar

45:10.093 --> 45:12.756
callin' you by name.
Glorifyin' your ass.

45:13.809 --> 45:16.905
Makes me sick, motherfucker,
how far we done fell.

45:38.535 --> 45:39.532
25,000.

45:39.837 --> 45:41.877
You don't need more
than that to get it done.

45:42.265 --> 45:43.133
The fuck you say ?

45:43.355 --> 45:46.179
I'm just tellin' you how they do
down at zoning and permits.

45:46.765 --> 45:48.478
They know you got
a general contractor

45:48.479 --> 45:50.602
and his people out there
sittin' on their ass.

45:50.636 --> 45:52.931
They know you payin'
twice that every week they sit.

45:52.956 --> 45:54.648
25 gets me the permits ?

45:55.840 --> 45:57.459
20 gets you the permits.

45:58.163 --> 46:01.283
Five is for me for bribin'
these downtown motherfuckers.

46:01.952 --> 46:04.107
I mean, I'm the one
got to risk walkin' up

46:04.130 --> 46:06.981
to these thievin' bitches
with cash in hand, right ?

46:07.755 --> 46:08.858
I'm telling you, String.

46:09.748 --> 46:11.555
The people running
the city nowadays ?

46:11.777 --> 46:13.732
They make the last
bunch look sanctified.

46:14.437 --> 46:16.431
I mean, this some shameful shit.

46:27.528 --> 46:28.665
Permits come when ?

46:29.533 --> 46:30.074
Monday.

46:30.860 --> 46:31.422
Latest.

46:42.941 --> 46:43.867
<i>Spider bags !</i>

46:44.829 --> 46:45.709
<i>Spider bags !</i>

46:46.237 --> 46:47.847
Cutt, that's him.

46:48.773 --> 46:49.265
Fruit.

46:53.219 --> 46:54.696
Yo, I know that nigger, man.

46:55.553 --> 46:57.090
Owe me money, actually.

47:04.891 --> 47:06.591
She ain't say it like that.

47:07.155 --> 47:09.395
She say it like she wanted
to get pregnant an' shit.

47:10.439 --> 47:10.850
A-ight.

47:38.920 --> 47:41.431
Damn, I opened up too early, man.

47:41.748 --> 47:42.827
I stepped on your shot.

47:43.788 --> 47:45.101
Come on, let's book.

47:49.123 --> 47:51.692
Yo, there go
five-oh right there, yo.

47:52.361 --> 47:53.580
Yeah, I know it's nothing.

47:55.411 --> 47:57.100
The cops be lettin'
niggas grind down here.

47:57.169 --> 48:00.571
It all... get the fuck out
of here little hoppers.

48:00.629 --> 48:01.779
Get out of here, son.

48:01.804 --> 48:03.374
Look at these little minis.

48:03.515 --> 48:04.982
Hey, yo, what if he lock us up ?

48:06.119 --> 48:07.562
I hope y'all got toothbrushes ?

48:09.048 --> 48:11.335
'Cause down in boy's village,
you know what I'm sayin'

48:11.359 --> 48:14.491
if you don't have no toothbrush,
you gonna be usin' some other boy's brush

48:14.514 --> 48:16.427
or rubbin' your teeth
with your damn finger.

48:16.438 --> 48:17.604
If you don't get locked up

48:17.628 --> 48:19.743
y'all can keep an extra
20 each off the pack.

48:25.846 --> 48:27.055
... got that fire, baby ?

48:31.230 --> 48:33.564
Come on, Tommy, give it up already.

48:33.869 --> 48:36.239
Look, Terri,
you gotta do this for me.

48:36.716 --> 48:38.253
Tell me why
you wanna be mayor.

48:38.405 --> 48:40.329
Why should I vote
for you over Royce ?

48:40.423 --> 48:43.390
'Cause something is wrong in that city
and I think I can fix it.

48:43.613 --> 48:46.745
This guy, he don't give a shit
about tackling the problems.

48:46.987 --> 48:49.005
Crime is outta fucking control.

48:49.286 --> 48:52.125
Last week, a kid witness
in a drug case turns up

48:52.148 --> 48:54.013
shot dead because
of flaws in the system.

48:54.037 --> 48:55.727
I go to the Mayor
who promises action.

48:55.750 --> 48:59.093
And then, "mister reform-is-more-than-
-the-watchword-of-my-administration"

48:59.105 --> 49:01.510
pats me on the ass,
thanks me for my concern

49:01.674 --> 49:03.175
points me out the door. The end.

49:03.503 --> 49:05.938
So, with crime as the issue

49:05.939 --> 49:08.289
the great white father
rides to the rescue.

49:08.884 --> 49:12.462
Against a black incumbent mayor,
in a city that's 65% black ?

49:12.931 --> 49:15.417
Black, white, green...
people are pissed off.

49:15.567 --> 49:17.408
What makes you
think this is doable ?

49:17.584 --> 49:21.338
One, I hear the mayor's got problems
in his base and with key supporters.

49:21.608 --> 49:23.778
Two, I got
the Police Commissioner

49:23.836 --> 49:25.956
Royce's own man,
telling me all kinds of stuff

49:25.980 --> 49:28.994
about his fucked-up department
and about Royce's inner circle.

49:29.088 --> 49:31.516
And three, Tony Gray,
from the Fifth District

49:31.657 --> 49:33.700
comes pretty close
to telling me he's thinking

49:33.713 --> 49:34.639
about a run for mayor.

49:34.896 --> 49:36.164
That'd split the black vote.

49:37.654 --> 49:38.766
You'd still need a player

49:38.789 --> 49:40.628
who gives the black
middle-class permission

49:40.663 --> 49:42.036
to vote against one of their own.

49:42.411 --> 49:44.088
You got one of those
in your pocket ?

49:44.182 --> 49:45.449
Not many of those around.

49:47.150 --> 49:47.772
Elijah ?

49:48.792 --> 49:51.607
Congressional black caucus
ain't gonna save your skinny white ass.

49:51.665 --> 49:54.376
What about Odell Watkins ?

49:54.527 --> 49:56.216
Well, it's funny you
should mention him

49:56.228 --> 49:58.867
cuz I don't think he's too
happy with the Mayor right now.

49:59.395 --> 49:59.876
I dunno.

49:59.900 --> 50:02.680
I hear a new poll shows Royce's
negatives are pretty high.

50:02.750 --> 50:04.428
You'd have to raise
a load of dough.

50:13.236 --> 50:15.067
He has to see it.
I know he sees it.

50:17.260 --> 50:18.504
It's past that now.

50:18.586 --> 50:20.182
It's about us showing some respect.

50:20.193 --> 50:21.354
Oh, fuck respect.

50:22.645 --> 50:24.416
- He ain't right.
- No, he ain't.

50:24.905 --> 50:25.691
But at this point

50:25.715 --> 50:27.638
with you on the other
side of the argument

50:27.674 --> 50:28.647
he'd rather be wrong.

50:29.363 --> 50:31.368
Maybe if the word
came down from on high

50:32.577 --> 50:34.114
it might change his mind.

50:37.653 --> 50:41.804
I mean, if your friend Bunny Colvin's
up to his ass in bodies

50:42.555 --> 50:44.475
then he'd take all
the help he can get.

50:49.484 --> 50:51.478
Not that you'd ever
go behind anybody's back

50:51.502 --> 50:54.352
or anything like that, right ?

50:58.256 --> 50:58.866
No way.

51:00.261 --> 51:01.846
Two more murders yesterday

51:02.678 --> 51:04.636
and another three today...

51:05.447 --> 51:06.677
including a 14-year-old.

51:07.381 --> 51:08.695
We're doing all we can.

51:09.246 --> 51:13.176
You're at 260 for the year
and it's barely october.

51:13.516 --> 51:15.802
You promised me 275 or under, Erv.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.219
I had that as a promise.

51:17.243 --> 51:17.677
Sir...

51:17.724 --> 51:20.117
we see 300 before the new year

51:20.139 --> 51:23.130
and I'm not sure that I can
justify a full term for you.

51:23.916 --> 51:25.864
Now I hate to say it,
but there it is.

51:32.147 --> 51:33.414
Barksdale's people and who ?

51:34.420 --> 51:39.182
Marlo Stanfield, the new kid,
we've been on him a couple weeks.

51:40.251 --> 51:42.302
But Daniels' people
are up in the Northwest.

51:43.546 --> 51:45.387
Your war's only
gonna get worse, Major.

51:47.847 --> 51:49.655
The Northwest has been
quiet for weeks.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.757
You willing to back door your
lieutenant like this, huh ?

51:58.091 --> 51:59.275
You ain't changed, Jimmy.

52:01.586 --> 52:02.360
Shit.

52:03.873 --> 52:05.106
It's always about your case.

52:07.369 --> 52:08.296
You do what you can.

52:14.820 --> 52:16.074
Keep my name out of it.

52:33.140 --> 52:33.727
How it go ?

52:34.395 --> 52:36.988
We got one of the two
of the motherfuckers you know.

52:37.105 --> 52:38.278
You mean, you motherfuckers

52:38.302 --> 52:40.519
come strollin' in here
all walkin' tall and shit...

52:40.530 --> 52:43.156
Yo, B, I, man, I'm sayin', man.
We were blazin' on them dudes.

52:43.168 --> 52:45.725
Man, you know what I'm sayin',
just got in the heat, man.

52:45.747 --> 52:47.390
We were blazin' though.
It was like...

52:47.414 --> 52:49.888
Alright relax, man, I already heard.
Go sit down.

52:50.319 --> 52:51.938
I'm not tweakin'
behind none of this.

52:51.973 --> 52:54.671
That's one less motherfucker
that's breathin' than was yesterday

52:54.683 --> 52:56.525
you know what I'm sayin',
so we all good.

52:56.536 --> 52:58.132
But I'm surprised at you,
though, man.

52:58.155 --> 52:59.668
Shit didn't get by you back when.

53:00.327 --> 53:01.758
Wadn't my man's fault, man.

53:01.922 --> 53:04.116
I unloaded on
the youngun too soon, man.

53:04.689 --> 53:06.708
Gave him enough room
to buck and run, man.

53:06.837 --> 53:08.830
I fucked that shit up
myself, you know...

53:08.937 --> 53:09.582
Hold on.

53:13.581 --> 53:14.614
It's on me.

53:15.939 --> 53:17.616
I had that kid in my sights

53:18.379 --> 53:21.757
close enough to take off his Kangol
and half his dome with it.

53:23.598 --> 53:24.924
I couldn't squeeze the trigger.

53:27.587 --> 53:28.477
Couldn't do it, man.

53:31.797 --> 53:32.361
Why not ?

53:36.162 --> 53:37.253
Wadn't in me, I guess.

53:40.044 --> 53:42.707
You know, whatever it is in you

53:44.220 --> 53:45.792
that lets you flow like you flowin'
