02:16.402 --> 02:18.734
Brenda. Brenda.
Brenda.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.297
- Brenda.
- Yes?

02:22.375 --> 02:24.309
- Mrs. Doyle?
- Yes?

02:24.377 --> 02:28.404
- Can I help you?
- I am Art Dodge from Art's Gallery on Lincoln Road.

02:28.481 --> 02:32.178
- I have Mr. Doyle's painting.
- Painting?

02:32.252 --> 02:35.312
Yeah, the one
he bought last week.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.879
My husband?
Benjamin Doyle?

02:37.957 --> 02:41.825
<i>Please accept my condolences.
He was a wonderful man, a wonderful man.</i>

02:41.895 --> 02:44.989
I never knew Benjamin
to be interested in art.

02:45.064 --> 02:49.091
He was.
He really was.

03:12.058 --> 03:15.084
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning.</i>

03:15.161 --> 03:17.561
- Business letter?
- What business?

03:17.630 --> 03:20.724
I'm writing my mother for money.
I've given up asking you.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.734
- Any calls?
- No.

03:22.802 --> 03:27.171
- Come on. None?
- Power and Light, Ma Bell, Sammy's Deli.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.333
I don't want to know.
I'm dead.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.071
- Well, that should simplify matters for somebody.
- Who?

03:32.145 --> 03:35.979
Hillerman. He says he's gonna kill you
for up to six months' back rent.

03:46.759 --> 03:49.353
- You remind me of my father.
- Is that a proposition?

03:49.429 --> 03:51.363
Come on.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.559
You both love to read
the obituaries.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.006
Oops.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.350
<i>- Hola, Conchita.
- Ah, Mrs...</i>

05:18.418 --> 05:22.320
<i>- Uh, Miss Kerner, please come in.
- Thank you.</i>

05:22.388 --> 05:26.154
- The service is private.
- I'd like to see Mr. Palletto.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.386
<i>- El senor?
- El senor.</i>

05:28.461 --> 05:32.192
<i>- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- What's the matter, Conchita?</i>

05:32.265 --> 05:36.133
Excuse me, I am Art Dodge
from Art's Gallery on Lincoln Road...

05:36.202 --> 05:38.932
and I have the painting
Mr. Palletto bought last week.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.496
I said I'd
deliver it today.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.737
- I think you better come in.
- Sure.

06:02.995 --> 06:06.590
You want me to believe
my dad bought that?

06:06.666 --> 06:09.533
Oh, it was your father?
I-I'm sorry. Eh, well, maybe...

06:09.602 --> 06:12.867
Maybe this is not
the right moment, but yeah.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.430
Last Monday
at my gallery.

06:15.508 --> 06:19.308
That's strange.
Last Monday Dad was in a hospital.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.878
- Did I say "last Monday"?
- Mm-hmm.

06:23.950 --> 06:28.614
Maybe... maybe it was
two Mondays ago.

06:28.688 --> 06:32.624
All I know is it was
definitely a Monday.

06:32.692 --> 06:35.820
What's definite is you're
a son of a bitch...

06:35.895 --> 06:37.829
with no respect
for a dead man...

06:37.897 --> 06:40.388
or his family's
suffering.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.399
But you're lucky.

06:44.470 --> 06:47.633
I'm going to help you understand
what suffering is.

06:52.612 --> 06:57.242
Eh... I-I-I can come back
another time.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.551
My father hated
modern art.

07:01.621 --> 07:04.556
He thought the people
who made it were pansies...

07:05.925 --> 07:09.554
and the people
who bought it were suckers.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.722
But they love it.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.998
When they get through
with you...

07:18.070 --> 07:21.335
your face is gonna look
like a Picasso.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.341
Wait, wait, wait.

07:23.409 --> 07:27.505
Maybe this is all
a big misunderstanding.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.515
What did you say
your father's name was?

08:09.922 --> 08:12.516
Let me in.

08:23.402 --> 08:27.998
- I'm sorry, Mama.
- Thank you. Thank you, dear.

08:31.143 --> 08:34.010
Thanks for coming,
Betty.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.014
Good-bye, Gene.

08:37.884 --> 08:41.115
You have my
deepest sympathy.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.780
No. You have mine.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.484
Oh.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.629
I hope time heals all your...

08:53.866 --> 08:56.960
- You're pushing it, pal.
- Pain.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.660
Maria, take care
of Mama.

10:02.134 --> 10:05.103
<i>Betty. Betty.
We need to talk.</i>

10:05.171 --> 10:09.403
<i>I have nothing to say to you, Gene. I
only came out of respect for your father.</i>

10:09.475 --> 10:11.443
Well, Betty, look.
I'm in bad shape.

10:11.510 --> 10:15.105
I'm at home crying my eyes out,
and you're out having a good time.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.548
I'd be having a better time if you
didn't follow me everywhere I went.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.917
You know the happiest day
of my father's life?

10:21.988 --> 10:24.218
The day you and I
got married.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.554
- You know the happiest day of my life?
- What?

10:26.626 --> 10:29.026
The day we got divorced.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.586
- Now get out of my way and leave me alone, you big bully.
- Ooh. Ow.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.599
Betty, Betty.
I'm seeing Dr. Huffeyer.

10:34.667 --> 10:38.967
Oh, great.
That's just great.

10:39.038 --> 10:42.838
Out of all the shrinks in Miami,
you have to go see mine?

10:42.908 --> 10:45.433
Well, I'm not gonna see him anymore because
I don't want to share anything with you...

10:45.511 --> 10:48.878
- not even this planet!
- He's helping me change.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.919
- I'm channeling all my anger
into some positive crap.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.114
Listen to me, damn it!
I've changed! Ow!

10:59.725 --> 11:02.387
I love you!

11:55.815 --> 11:58.648
<i>You can come out now.</i>

12:01.687 --> 12:03.712
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

12:03.789 --> 12:07.555
That was exciting,
with those big lugs looking for you...

12:07.626 --> 12:11.562
and Gene standing there
not knowing you were in the back seat.

12:11.630 --> 12:14.326
I had a hunch something great
was gonna happen today.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.891
<i>- It did. I'm still alive.
- Yeah.</i>

12:19.438 --> 12:23.374
- Sorry.
- For now. Thanks to you.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.535
I'm Betty.
Betty Kerner.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.911
- Art Dodge.
- It's really nice to meet you, Art.

12:29.982 --> 12:34.681
<i>Same here, Betty.</i>

12:36.122 --> 12:38.920
I guess you are not
going downtown, right?

12:38.991 --> 12:41.585
Uh-uh.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.568
Let me see if you got this right.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.578
<i>- Arriba.
- Arriba.</i>

13:33.646 --> 13:35.580
<i>- Abajo.
- Abajo.</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:38.242
<i>- Al centro.
- Al centro.</i>

13:38.317 --> 13:40.649
<i>- Por dentro.
- Por dentro.</i>

13:44.356 --> 13:46.290
Mmm.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.457
I'm loaded.
Um, what about you?

13:51.530 --> 13:53.589
No.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.760
No, I cry too much.
Don't you ever cry?

13:56.836 --> 14:00.932
Oh, yeah, sure I do. Whenever I
pay taxes, which isn't often anyway.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.338
- You're crazy.
- So are you.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.344
A match made in heaven.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.983
A very long,
pretty blond eyelash.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.488
- Take it with your finger.
- Yeah.

14:17.556 --> 14:20.047
- Okay.
- Make a wish.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.153
- Okay.
- Blow it away.

14:29.368 --> 14:33.634
<i>Who is it?</i>

14:33.706 --> 14:35.640
<i>It's Ellen, darling. Open up.</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:38.973
Oh, gee, in a second.
Just...

14:39.044 --> 14:41.274
<i>Oof!</i>

14:43.215 --> 14:44.807
Oh. Ohh!

14:52.524 --> 14:55.357
I was right.

14:57.496 --> 15:00.727
A match made in heaven.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.495
Hey, that's
Betty Kerner.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.659
And who's that bimbo
with her?

15:36.735 --> 15:38.669
Let's check it out.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.671
Hmm.

15:40.739 --> 15:44.197
They say that the
third time is the charm.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.244
Third what?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.746
- Marriage.
- Oh.

15:48.814 --> 15:52.773
Who was the first?

15:52.851 --> 15:54.682
Gene.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.687
- Who was the second?
- Gene.

15:56.755 --> 15:59.690
You married that guy
twice?

15:59.758 --> 16:02.591
Now ask me who's
gonna be the third.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.858
Miss Kerner. Hey, Miss Kerner,
who's your new friend?

16:05.931 --> 16:08.900
- Eh...
- My fiancé.

16:47.806 --> 16:50.639
Cool.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.502
One, two, three!

17:18.569 --> 17:20.595
<i>Aah!</i>

17:23.342 --> 17:27.278
Boom, boom!
Can you guess what I am thinking?

17:35.354 --> 17:37.288
Can you guess
what I'm thinking?

17:37.356 --> 17:39.620
I'm sorry.

17:39.691 --> 17:43.218
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.
I-I-I thought that...

17:43.295 --> 17:45.490
You can go out
the same way you came in.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.261
Sure. Uh...
I'm sorry.

17:49.334 --> 17:52.735
<i>Wild guess,
but are these yours?</i>

17:54.073 --> 17:56.268
Yes.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.275
Sorry.

18:01.980 --> 18:04.915
- I'm sorry.
- I know. Now try "good-bye."

18:04.983 --> 18:07.508
Good-bye.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.824
<i>Oh, Dios.</i>

18:13.892 --> 18:16.861
<i>But I have to have it fitted tomorrow.</i>

18:16.929 --> 18:19.056
<i>Ciao.</i>

18:19.131 --> 18:22.191
<i>- How long have you known him?
- Seems like forever.</i>

18:22.267 --> 18:24.827
<i>Oh, less than
24 hours then.</i>

18:24.903 --> 18:28.771
Oh, yes, Hopper.
Of course you can be the flower dog.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.901
<i>Right?</i>

18:31.977 --> 18:36.141
<i>So do I get a new bridesmaid's getup, or should
I just put some more miles on the old one?</i>

18:38.217 --> 18:40.151
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:40.219 --> 18:44.747
<i>- You've met my sister Liz already.
- Yeah.</i>

18:44.823 --> 18:47.291
<i>Lay down, now.</i>

18:47.359 --> 18:50.886
Hello?

18:50.963 --> 18:55.627
No, no, no, the invitations should read
"The Honorable Art Dodge," don't you think?

18:55.701 --> 18:58.499
- The invitations?
- Yeah. Engraved.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.800
And they should be
in the mail by Tuesday.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.205
Okay. Ciao.
Fantastic. Bye.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.711
- Betty, can I talk to you alone?
- Yeah, in one second.

19:06.778 --> 19:09.144
In one second.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.507
Father Larrabee.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.814
He's on the golf course?

19:14.887 --> 19:18.823
<i>- Wow, you hooked yourself the big one, didn't you?
- Do you have a cellular number?</i>

19:18.891 --> 19:22.054
This must go way beyond
your wildest little gigolo dreams.

19:22.127 --> 19:25.563
<i>Okay. Thanks.
Isn't he adorable?</i>

19:25.631 --> 19:28.794
- Yeah.
- Betty, we need to talk.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.927
- Wait.
- What about? Your allowance?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.097
<i>- Father Larrabee, it's Betty.
- Look...</i>

19:34.173 --> 19:37.768
<i>- I don't need to. I've seen enough.
- It's good? Great.</i>

19:37.843 --> 19:41.370
No, no. He's a different one.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.438
Yes, but he's wonderful,
and you'll love him.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.110
<i>I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.</i>

19:47.186 --> 19:50.587
So how does
the third sound?

19:50.656 --> 19:53.420
It's my birthday.
I'll be 33.

19:53.492 --> 19:58.225
<i>It's my third wedding,
and three is my lucky number.</i>

19:58.297 --> 20:01.164
- Great. Great.
- Yes?

20:01.233 --> 20:05.693
- Eh, I've got to go to work.
- It has a job. How refreshing.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.039
<i>- Gotta go. Bye.
- Have a good day.</i>

20:10.108 --> 20:13.202
Come on, buddy.
Come on, boy.

20:13.278 --> 20:17.237
- I don't think she likes me.
- Oh, don't listen to her.

20:17.316 --> 20:22.481
She's been involved with this guy who's a
married man. It's been a really bad deal.

20:31.496 --> 20:35.762
<i>I see congratulations
are in order.</i>

20:35.834 --> 20:39.668
I am not getting married.
It's like a big misunderstanding.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.434
<i>- Okay?
- Oh, so, like, you've explained it to her...</i>

20:42.507 --> 20:44.771
and everything's all
straightened out for ya?

20:44.843 --> 20:48.108
<i>- Well, no, not exactly.
- Uh-huh.</i>

20:48.180 --> 20:50.774
<i>Everything is totally
high or low with her.</i>

20:50.849 --> 20:53.943
She'll be down on me soon enough,
and then it'll all be over.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.817
Trust me. She's a girl
with big extremes.

20:56.888 --> 21:00.255
So I see.
Manny's in there.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.259
He's been in there
for an hour.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.057
- Come on, Gloria.
- What do you want me to do?

21:05.130 --> 21:07.928
I feel sorry for the guy.
We owe him for two paintings.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.061
Is the I RS in there?
Maybe you feel sorry for everyone I owe.

21:12.137 --> 21:16.301
Everyone? No.
I don't believe in self-pity.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.208
Manny. Just the man
I wanted to see.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.738
- Art.
- What's that?

21:24.816 --> 21:29.515
Wow!
This is terrific.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.148
- I can sell it in a week.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

21:32.224 --> 21:34.419
- It's been hanging here for three months.
- Really?

21:34.493 --> 21:37.189
I'm taking them all home.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.924
<i>- Art?
- Yeah?</i>

21:39.998 --> 21:42.432
You still haven't paid me
for the last two.

21:42.501 --> 21:45.834
Wha...
You should thank me.

21:45.904 --> 21:49.931
Manny,
if Vincent van Gogh...

21:50.008 --> 21:52.533
had been paid
for his paintings...

21:52.611 --> 21:55.341
they would be worthless
today.

21:55.414 --> 21:59.111
You shouldn't be thinking about money.
You're an artist.

21:59.184 --> 22:02.881
You're a real one.
I can see that in your eyes.

22:02.954 --> 22:06.720
Huh? Yeah, yeah!
Believe me. Yeah.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.618
You know...
You know, Manny...

22:10.696 --> 22:14.063
Manny, go home and paint.

22:14.132 --> 22:17.624
Paint, Manny, paint.
Come on. Eh?

22:17.703 --> 22:20.900
- Yeah, yeah. Maybe you're right.
- Yeah, I'm right.

22:20.972 --> 22:23.907
- But what about you?
- What about me? What? What?

22:23.975 --> 22:28.275
- You were good.
- Good is the same as bad.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.713
It has to be brilliant.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.751
Yeah. So why is it
hanging on your wall?

22:36.455 --> 22:39.618
Well, it's just, uh...

22:39.691 --> 22:42.717
reminding me not
to pick up a brush again.

22:42.794 --> 22:46.855
Yeah. You like it?
Take it.

22:46.932 --> 22:51.926
It's yours. Consider it an advance
on what I owe you.

22:52.003 --> 22:53.937
Huh?

22:57.008 --> 22:59.602
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

22:59.678 --> 23:03.205
Real artists
don't need words.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.084
Eh?

23:08.420 --> 23:10.752
All right.

23:10.822 --> 23:13.382
Good-bye.
See you, huh?

23:29.574 --> 23:32.338
- What's Manny doing with your painting?
- I'm redecorating.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.404
It was the nicest thing
in here.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.653
Excuse me, miss.

23:50.729 --> 23:54.256
You have a provocative
work of art here.

23:54.332 --> 23:57.597
May I take it home
and live with it for a few days...

23:57.669 --> 23:59.603
before I make
my final decision?

23:59.671 --> 24:02.765
And which work of art
would that be?

24:02.841 --> 24:06.470
You. You're the most
beautiful one here.

24:06.545 --> 24:10.379
No, I will not go home
with you, Mr. Dodge.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.715
I'm sorry. Have we met?
See, sometimes my memory fails me.

24:14.786 --> 24:19.746
I-I have...
Korsakov's Syndrome, which means...

24:19.825 --> 24:24.558
If it means always hitting on me,
I'd say you have a terminal case.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.224
- Art, your dad's here.
- l...

24:30.068 --> 24:33.663
Dad, what are you doing here?
I told you I'd pick you up.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.899
I wanted to save you
the trouble.

24:35.974 --> 24:40.502
<i>The last time you saved me the trouble, I
had to track you down at the police station.</i>

24:40.579 --> 24:42.570
I was not lost.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.241
I was arrested for demonstrating against
the death penalty.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.014
Me and my comrades
from the Lincoln Brigade.

24:49.087 --> 24:51.021
Did I ever show you
my scar?

24:51.089 --> 24:54.115
- She has seen it.
- It's a lovely scar, Mr. Dodge.

24:54.192 --> 24:58.492
I'm the only man alive
with two navels.

25:13.044 --> 25:14.978
What's this?

25:15.046 --> 25:18.709
We live in a big, red,
horrible building.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.978
That was in Madrid,
remember?

25:21.052 --> 25:25.284
We moved here four years ago
when Mom died.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.155
Your mother was a fine woman.
Don't drag her into this.

25:28.226 --> 25:30.558
Come on.
Well, this is our home now.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.961
I know that.
You got the big room.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.056
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

25:35.133 --> 25:39.797
- You have the one with the best ventilation.
- That's true.

25:41.706 --> 25:45.073
<i>Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.</i>

25:45.143 --> 25:50.080
<i>Ooh, yes! Yes.
That is exactly what I want.</i>

25:50.148 --> 25:54.983
Hold on. Okay, one cake with the three
in Roman numerals.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.817
That way each one
can be a different flavor.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.916
One could be vanilla, one could be
carrot, and one could be strawberry.

26:01.993 --> 26:05.588
What? Ooh, mocha.
Mmm, that sounds good.

26:05.664 --> 26:08.360
Should we lose the vanilla
or the strawberry?

26:08.433 --> 26:11.994
- Betty, we need to talk and...
- He wants to talk about it.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.004
<i>- I'll call you back. Good-bye.
- Excuse me.</i>

26:14.072 --> 26:18.509
I am not losing the carrot.
God, you are so gorgeous.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.445
You know that? You're gonna look
so good with me up at the altar.

26:24.549 --> 26:27.382
- Eh, excuse us a second. Can you come here?
- Yeah.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.756
Eh...

26:32.824 --> 26:35.384
Listen, Betty, um...

26:35.460 --> 26:39.191
I-I couldn't sleep
last night, uh...

26:39.264 --> 26:42.165
Um... I don't know where to begin.

26:42.233 --> 26:45.464
You are so... special.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.471
Mmm.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.633
Yeah. One in a million.
A real lifesaver.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.904
- I-I owe you big time.
- No.

26:52.978 --> 26:56.812
But, you know,
I was thinking...

26:56.881 --> 27:00.647
"Betty is just too good
for me."

27:02.654 --> 27:04.781
It's like a voice
that says...

27:04.856 --> 27:09.259
"Art, you don't
deserve her."

27:09.327 --> 27:12.455
- It... um...
- What are you saying?

27:12.530 --> 27:14.623
A-All I am saying...

27:14.699 --> 27:17.190
is... is just... wow.

27:17.268 --> 27:20.704
Two weeks. Is that long enough?
I mean, marriage.

27:20.772 --> 27:24.765
Huge in the decision
department, right? Huh?

27:37.022 --> 27:39.388
- What the hell did you do to my sister?
- Nothing, nothing.

27:39.457 --> 27:41.391
- l...
- Don't you hurt her.

27:41.459 --> 27:45.054
All I said to her was
that we were moving a little too fast.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.360
I thought guys like you
always moved too fast.

27:47.432 --> 27:51.027
If you're gonna play the stud,
at least have the common decency...

27:51.102 --> 27:53.070
to do it well
and make her happy.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.650
Betty...

28:07.886 --> 28:09.854
I'm sorry.

28:09.921 --> 28:14.051
- I really didn't mean to upset you.
- Oh, darling, I'm strong.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.992
I spoke to Dr. Huffeyer...

28:17.062 --> 28:20.327
and he said that as long as
I externalize my feelings...

28:20.398 --> 28:24.630
without inhibition...
even my anger...

28:24.703 --> 28:26.796
then everything is fine.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.362
So I'm fine.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.376
And I don't want you
to feel that you can't be...

28:32.444 --> 28:34.469
completely honest with me...

28:34.546 --> 28:38.949
because marriage needs to be based
on openness and trust...

28:39.017 --> 28:42.418
as well as basic
sexual compatibility.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.157
Everything is fine.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.626
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

28:50.695 --> 28:53.061
Everything is fantastic.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.631
- Good.
- Except for your sister.

28:59.704 --> 29:04.073
Uh... I don't think
she's too crazy about me.

29:04.142 --> 29:07.771
- Well, that's because you're not her type.
- Huh?

29:07.846 --> 29:11.907
I mean, she teaches modern
art at the university, for God's sake.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.687
<i>She goes for those
quasi-intellectual types...</i>

29:16.755 --> 29:20.122
with the glasses
and the frown lines...

29:20.191 --> 29:22.955
<i>and Siberian movies.</i>

29:29.000 --> 29:32.458
<i>Don't. I don't want
to hear it anymore.</i>

29:38.443 --> 29:41.037
<i>You're not gonna leave her.</i>

29:41.112 --> 29:44.013
She knows it.
You know it.

29:44.082 --> 29:47.449
And finally,
I know it.

29:49.387 --> 29:51.617
<i>Bye.</i>

30:12.076 --> 30:14.738
- What's this?
- Mrs. Doyle returned it.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.315
What kind of country
is this...

30:18.383 --> 30:21.580
where people don't even
respect the last wishes of the dead?

30:29.894 --> 30:32.954
Shall I read you the mail or throw it
directly into the wastebasket?

30:33.031 --> 30:36.000
You should only read
love letters.

30:36.067 --> 30:38.661
But they are love letters.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.670
Here's a love letter
from the bank...

30:40.738 --> 30:44.230
and one from the
insurance company...

30:44.309 --> 30:48.405
and, ooh,
very romantic.

30:48.479 --> 30:51.277
A letter
from your optician...

30:51.349 --> 30:54.546
accompanied, of course,
by the bill for your last contacts.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.521
Bills, bills, bills.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.184
Is that all people
ever think about?

31:01.259 --> 31:04.387
What if I don't pay? What are
they gonna do, gouge my eyes out?

31:04.462 --> 31:06.692
I wouldn't give them
any ideas.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.240
Pay the man.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.659
Is Mr. Dodge in?

31:41.733 --> 31:46.932
Do me a favor and tell my brother Arthur
to stop playing hide-and-seek with me.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.940
<i>Tell him I need to
speak to him tonight, you understand?</i>

31:51.676 --> 31:56.010
- Uh, Mr. Dodge.
- You are looking for my brother too?

31:56.080 --> 32:00.983
<i>If you see him before I do,
please tell him I am in town.</i>

32:21.339 --> 32:24.797
Tell him I am in town.

32:27.211 --> 32:29.805
Tell him...

32:29.881 --> 32:32.475
Bart is in town.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.570
Art Dodge, please.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.102
Someone who sounds like Art
calling for Art.

33:05.216 --> 33:08.617
- Hello?
- Hello. I'm calling Art Dodge.

33:08.686 --> 33:11.621
His gallery said I could
reach him at this number.

33:13.257 --> 33:16.385
Fifteen minutes?
I'll call back.

33:16.461 --> 33:19.988
It's his brother, Bart.

33:20.064 --> 33:22.123
All right. Fine.
Bye.

33:23.368 --> 33:26.132
Fine, fine. Fine.

33:35.113 --> 33:38.776
Gloria, it's me.
Listen, it's important.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.580
Call me at Betty's
in exactly, uh...

33:41.652 --> 33:43.586
twenty minutes.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.693
Hi.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.096
Hi.

33:55.166 --> 33:59.626
- Oh, your brother called.
- What? What did you say?

33:59.704 --> 34:02.264
She said your brother called.
What's the matter? Is he dead?

34:02.340 --> 34:06.538
- Since when do you have a brother?
- Since I was 12 minutes old.

34:06.611 --> 34:09.670
- You're twins?
- Yeah.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.840
Huh. Absolutely identical.
Yeah.

34:11.916 --> 34:13.940
That's a happy thought.

34:14.018 --> 34:18.181
Well, we look the same, but,
uh, we've got nothing in common.

34:18.255 --> 34:22.716
I mean, he paints, he
broods, he lives for his art.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.728
He doesn't even like
to sell it.

34:24.795 --> 34:27.389
Maybe he just likes
what he does.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.956
Yeah, who knows?
It takes all kinds.

34:30.034 --> 34:34.596
You know what? He burns some of
his paintings. He's... He's crazy.

34:34.672 --> 34:37.971
That sounds like a colossal
waste of time to me.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.373
Sounds like he might
even be a human being.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.538
<i>- When was the last time you saw him?
- Years.</i>

34:42.612 --> 34:45.980
<i>Last I heard, he was in Italy.</i>

34:46.050 --> 34:48.449
Sorry.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.453
<i>Hello?</i>

34:51.556 --> 34:53.989
Yeah. Hold on.
It's for you.

34:54.058 --> 34:56.583
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.186
Really?

35:00.665 --> 35:03.429
- Hello?
- At the tone, the time will be...

35:03.501 --> 35:06.993
exactly 8:30.
Beep.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.938
Gloria, Gloria.
Have you got Bart there?

35:10.007 --> 35:12.601
- I just don't know how to answer that one.
- Let me talk to him.

35:12.677 --> 35:16.670
There must be an easier way
to get a girl into the sack.

35:16.747 --> 35:19.045
Bart? Oh, God!

35:19.117 --> 35:21.449
I can't believe
it's you, man!

35:21.519 --> 35:24.545
I can't believe this is how I'm
using my degree in architecture.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.022
How long are you here for?
What are your plans?

35:27.091 --> 35:30.322
Met this guy a couple of days
ago, works for Sentinel Express.

35:30.394 --> 35:33.227
Maybe we'll have a few drinks. I'll
check out his overnight delivery.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.231
You know, I really
want to see you.

35:35.299 --> 35:38.826
Your relationships with women are
getting more and more bizarre, Art.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.701
- You want to get that looked at.
- When can we get together?

35:41.772 --> 35:43.967
Maybe you should try the
personals. You know what I mean?

35:44.041 --> 35:46.305
- I see, I see.
- Have you considered masturbation?

35:46.377 --> 35:48.311
Well, I can't
promise anything.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.813
<i>Oh, come on.
Promise me something.</i>

35:50.882 --> 35:54.750
- Okay, we'll talk tomorrow.
- Sure, if you're still alive and out of a straitjacket.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.811
- Seriously. Look after yourself,
will ya?

35:57.889 --> 36:01.655
You now owe me four weeks' salary.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.160
- Okay, okay. See you. All right?
- Okay.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.389
Bye, bye, bye.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.398
This guy is incredible.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.400
Love to meet your family.

36:10.468 --> 36:13.562
Personally, I'd rather meet
the Manson family.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.368
"Furthermore,
Mr. President...

36:16.440 --> 36:20.069
"the situation in Algiers
is a disaster.

36:21.145 --> 36:24.342
<i>Dad, Bart's in Miami.</i>

36:24.415 --> 36:27.441
"And the firing...

36:27.518 --> 36:31.784
"of the surgeon general...

36:33.691 --> 36:36.626
<i>"was a major...</i>

36:38.763 --> 36:40.697
"mistake.

36:42.466 --> 36:44.400
What a woman."

36:45.469 --> 36:49.701
I said Bart is in town.

36:49.774 --> 36:52.607
That's nice.

36:52.677 --> 36:54.804
You... You know who
Bart is, don't you?

36:54.879 --> 36:56.813
Of course I do.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.044
I mean, your son,
my twin brother.

37:00.117 --> 37:03.746
- I know who Bart is!
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:03.821 --> 37:07.416
Just because, uh, someone might
call and want to talk to him.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.925
Or you... you might meet
someone who mentions him to you.

37:09.994 --> 37:13.088
I just don't want you to act like you've
never heard of him. You know what I mean?

37:13.164 --> 37:16.133
Believe me, if I'm gonna forget
either son...

37:16.200 --> 37:18.430
it'll be you.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.436
Thank you.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.813
I'm not going to help you!

37:31.882 --> 37:35.784
The next time you're in a jam, I'd
prefer you were straight with me!

37:35.853 --> 37:37.787
I knew it.
I mean, yes, yes.

37:37.855 --> 37:42.121
Your brain works just fine when
something's in it for you, of course.

37:42.193 --> 37:46.129
Listen, you son of a bitch,
and may your mother forgive me.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.529
What is this bullshit
all about?

37:48.599 --> 37:51.864
Well, I was just trying to get you
to help me without having to ask you.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.666
- That's all.
- So ask me.

37:54.739 --> 37:58.266
- I'm your father, right?
- Ah.

38:00.911 --> 38:03.004
Is it money or women?

38:03.080 --> 38:06.709
No, it's...
You don't have to help me.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.344
No, no, you don't want to,
you don't have to do it.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.945
- Money or women?
- Women.

38:13.024 --> 38:16.118
<i>Is she... special?</i>

38:18.195 --> 38:21.130
So what's the problem?

38:23.067 --> 38:26.195
- I'm gonna get married.
- It's about time.

38:26.270 --> 38:28.465
To her sister.

38:29.607 --> 38:34.310
Oh.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.508
Her sister.

38:38.582 --> 38:42.211
This... This twin...

38:42.286 --> 38:44.720
with the idiotic name.

38:44.789 --> 38:47.280
H-He's going to
fix all that?

38:47.358 --> 38:51.089
- Damned if I know. Huh.
- Hmm.

39:01.739 --> 39:05.641
Listen, any second now a woman is
gonna walk in here asking for me.

39:05.710 --> 39:09.578
Tell her I am not in, but she
can speak to my brother Bart.

39:09.647 --> 39:12.582
<i>Bart. Get it?</i>

39:14.652 --> 39:18.281
Yeah, I lie to the woman you're engaged
to, but it's not as bad as it sounds.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.290
I get it. Mm-hmm.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.738
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

39:43.814 --> 39:45.748
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

39:45.816 --> 39:48.546
I'm looking for
Mr. Art Dodge.

39:48.619 --> 39:51.247
- He's not in at the moment.
- Oh.

39:51.322 --> 39:56.885
<i>But if you like, you can
speak with his brother... Bart.</i>

39:56.961 --> 40:00.158
Bart's here?
Oh, I'd love to meet him.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.792
- You mean you don't know him?
- Well, he just arrived from Italy.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.962
Ohh! Of course.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.465
And who shall I say
is here?

40:10.541 --> 40:12.668
Betty Kerner,
Art's fiancée.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.876
- Bart?
- Yes?

40:19.950 --> 40:24.751
Your... brother's
fiancée is here.

40:24.822 --> 40:28.588
- A Miss Kerner.
- Please, uh, send her in.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.693
Right this way.

40:37.768 --> 40:41.636
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.536
So, you are Betty.

40:50.681 --> 40:53.445
I'm surprised.

40:53.517 --> 40:55.451
So am I.

40:55.519 --> 40:57.987
You're not at all alike.

40:59.723 --> 41:04.092
My brother is obviously attracting
more perceptive women these days.

41:04.161 --> 41:07.494
Thank you.
What do you mean, "these days"?

41:07.565 --> 41:10.125
Well, let's just say...

41:10.201 --> 41:12.795
the girls he used to
bring around...

41:12.870 --> 41:15.395
didn't have your class...

41:15.473 --> 41:17.941
or subtlety.

41:18.008 --> 41:21.466
My brother has
a certain charm.

41:21.545 --> 41:25.072
But don't you find him
a little... boring...

41:25.149 --> 41:28.277
a bit, um, limited?

41:28.352 --> 41:30.650
Not yet.

41:30.721 --> 41:32.655
Art says you're an artist.

41:32.723 --> 41:37.888
You can't really say that about a person
until he's been dead at least, uh, ten years.

41:37.962 --> 41:40.487
What a point of view.

41:40.564 --> 41:42.498
That's so pedantic.

41:42.566 --> 41:44.431
- Eh?
- I mean romantic.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.663
Ah.

41:46.737 --> 41:49.069
My sister
would love you.

41:49.139 --> 41:52.074
Why don't you come by with
Art for dinner tonight?

41:52.142 --> 41:54.838
And you can talk about art
and the meaning of life.

41:54.912 --> 41:57.506
- l-l-l...
- I won't take no for an answer.

41:57.581 --> 42:00.948
- 9:00.
- Okay. Okay.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.452
I can't wait
for my brother.

42:06.624 --> 42:09.821
Miss Fletcher,
if my brother shows up...

42:09.894 --> 42:13.386
please tell him
I need to speak to him.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.898
Betty, a pleasure.

42:15.966 --> 42:17.900
Until tonight, then.

42:17.968 --> 42:20.300
Yeah. Tonight.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.695
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

43:10.187 --> 43:13.156
<i>- Betty! You been here long?
- No.</i>

43:13.223 --> 43:15.885
- I met your brother.
- Ohh.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.554
- You're right. He's very complicated.
- Yeah.

43:18.629 --> 43:20.620
But you know what?
He would make a great best man.

43:20.698 --> 43:25.533
Fabulous idea!
He'll love that.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.798
I-I am not sure.

43:27.871 --> 43:29.805
- I'll check it out.
- Okay.

43:29.873 --> 43:34.003
<i>Your brother wants you to call
him anyway. It sounded important.</i>

43:34.078 --> 43:38.674
Darling, would you wait for
me in the car? I won't be long.

43:38.749 --> 43:41.343
Okay. You'll be
at the wedding?

43:41.418 --> 43:44.683
- Wouldn't miss it.
- Okay.

43:55.699 --> 43:59.726
<i>You know, I don't mind lying about
the check being in the mail...</i>

43:59.803 --> 44:02.931
or that some kid's
the new Jackson Pollock...

44:03.007 --> 44:07.535
but I just don't think $7.50
an hour covers whatever this is.

44:07.611 --> 44:11.172
Well, you choose.

44:11.248 --> 44:14.012
It's that or back
to the suicide hot line.

44:17.554 --> 44:20.182
- Art?
- What now?

44:20.257 --> 44:24.023
My name is Gloria. Don't you
ever call me Miss Fletcher again.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.100
What are you doing here? Why do
you follow me everyplace that I go?

44:31.168 --> 44:33.398
I'm not following you. I'm looking out
for you. Someone's gotta protect you.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.904
<i>- You can't take care of yourself.
- I don't want your protection.</i>

44:35.973 --> 44:38.908
<i>- I want you to leave me alone.
- What are you doing with this guy?</i>

44:38.976 --> 44:41.570
Yeah, Art, Art, it's...
it's great to see you again.

44:41.645 --> 44:44.739
You know, Betty's been saying
such wonderful things about you.

44:44.815 --> 44:47.010
Don't touch him!
Don't even get near him.

44:47.084 --> 44:50.349
I'm just trying to congratulate him. Anyone
who makes you happy makes me happy.

44:50.421 --> 44:53.015
You are not fooling me, Gene.
I know you.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.957
No, you know the old Gene. I'm not
the same guy. I mean, give me a chance.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.961
l... here. Here.
I brought you some flowers.

44:59.029 --> 45:00.963
- Thank you.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

45:01.031 --> 45:02.965
- I'm just a warmhearted guy.
- Wh... What are you...

45:03.033 --> 45:04.967
- Hey! Hey!
- What... What are you doing?

45:05.035 --> 45:07.970
What are you doing?
Giving him the kiss of death?

45:18.182 --> 45:21.208
Kiss of death? What kiss of death?
What is that?

45:21.285 --> 45:23.719
He kisses you,
you're history.

45:23.787 --> 45:27.223
<i>- Didn't you ever see The Godfather?
- Which one?</i>

45:35.199 --> 45:37.565
- Just a moment, sir.
- Sure.

45:47.544 --> 45:49.808
<i>You must be Bart.</i>

45:50.547 --> 45:52.481
And you must be Liz.

45:55.252 --> 45:57.914
So Art told you about me?

45:57.988 --> 46:02.015
Well, eh, he tells me
that you two...

46:02.092 --> 46:04.287
got off
on the wrong foot.

46:04.361 --> 46:07.853
That's a very artful way of putting it.

46:07.931 --> 46:10.161
Yeah, I suppose it is.

46:10.234 --> 46:13.795
- I know he comes off as a little, uh...
- Slick?

46:13.871 --> 46:15.896
Uh, slick.
Really?

46:15.973 --> 46:18.373
- I think he's cool.
- Cool, slick. Whatever.

46:18.442 --> 46:21.843
It's... it fits him.
He's a very smooth operator.

46:21.912 --> 46:25.075
He had to be to survive.

46:25.149 --> 46:29.210
- Survive what?
- Well, we grew up without any money.

46:29.286 --> 46:34.155
You know, I was an artist,
and the kids used to kick my ass all the time.

46:34.224 --> 46:37.022
<i>- He protected me.
- Hello, Bart.</i>

46:37.094 --> 46:40.552
- Hi.
- Hi. Art just called and he can't come.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.998
He said there's some kind of problem
with your dad?

46:44.067 --> 46:48.026
Yeah, the old man's got Korsakov's Syndrome.
You know, memory problems.

46:48.105 --> 46:51.006
Well, it was very nice of Art
to let you come.

46:51.074 --> 46:54.737
Very nice. He's got
a very nice side to him.

46:56.246 --> 46:58.214
Dinner's out
on the veranda.

46:58.282 --> 47:01.149
- This way.
- Oh.

47:01.218 --> 47:04.085
- This is a very nice house, hmm?
- Thank you.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.885
- Wow.
- Glad you came?

47:07.958 --> 47:11.189
For me,
there is only Rimbaud.

47:11.261 --> 47:14.025
Rimbaud. Why?

47:14.097 --> 47:17.362
Well, it's obvious.
He's the original.

47:17.434 --> 47:21.268
I mean, Seagal and Van Damme
are just cheap imitations.

47:23.073 --> 47:26.201
I admire him because
he had the good sense...

47:26.276 --> 47:28.471
to quit while he
was still ahead.

47:28.545 --> 47:31.844
I disagree.
I think that two sequels was plenty.

47:33.217 --> 47:37.153
Honey, Rimbaud, not Rambo.
Poet, French, dead.

47:37.221 --> 47:41.453
I'm just trying to change the
subject before I fall asleep...

47:41.525 --> 47:43.459
<i>face down in my plate.</i>

47:43.527 --> 47:46.894
So are you saying that all artists
should quit when they're 18?

47:46.964 --> 47:51.196
Well, no, but th-they should
have enough sense to stop...

47:51.268 --> 47:53.202
when their best work
is behind them.

47:53.270 --> 47:55.932
You're not gonna
smoke that, are you?

47:56.006 --> 47:57.940
No, I'm gonna eat it.

48:20.697 --> 48:23.291
Excuse me.

48:23.367 --> 48:26.461
My ex-brother-in-law.
He's big on drama.

48:28.538 --> 48:30.563
Unlike your sister.

48:30.641 --> 48:33.769
Get off of my dock,
you maniac.

48:33.844 --> 48:38.645
<i>Are you crazy? Somebody should
take you away and, and lock you up.</i>

48:38.715 --> 48:40.979
Do you know what day
this is, darling?

48:41.051 --> 48:46.250
- Yeah, it's the day they take out the trash.
- It's our anniversary.

48:46.323 --> 48:50.020
No, it's not.
Our anniversary is June 8.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.960
Our second anniversary.

48:53.030 --> 48:54.964
You came all the way here
to tell me that?

48:55.032 --> 48:58.365
I've been paying Dr. Huffeyer a lot
of money so that I could forget it.

49:07.411 --> 49:11.677
<i>Remember the church in Cabo?</i>

49:11.748 --> 49:14.945
<i>That funny little priest.</i>

49:15.018 --> 49:17.987
The burro that ate my bouquet.

49:20.724 --> 49:23.056
It's not gonna work.

49:25.128 --> 49:27.961
No, but the music
is great.

49:30.667 --> 49:32.601
Why, thank you.

49:35.072 --> 49:37.006
Hi, there.

49:38.942 --> 49:41.274
Go for it.

49:51.922 --> 49:56.052
Fireworks and flowers are not gonna
do it, Gene, and neither are mariachi.

49:56.126 --> 49:59.653
They were playing this song.

50:01.465 --> 50:04.332
These are the guys.
I flew 'em in first class.

50:04.401 --> 50:08.269
I even had to get Pablo out of prison,
so it would be perfect for you.

50:13.810 --> 50:15.641
Dance with me?

50:15.712 --> 50:18.772
Go away.

50:20.150 --> 50:22.084
Please?

50:23.754 --> 50:25.688
One last time.

50:25.756 --> 50:29.954
On my honor, I-I'll
never bother you again.

50:32.229 --> 50:34.163
Dance with me?

50:50.247 --> 50:53.375
Have you ever been married?

50:53.450 --> 50:55.384
- No.
- Never.

50:58.722 --> 51:00.656
- Hopper.
- Oh.

51:00.724 --> 51:04.387
So Hopper is, uh,
illegitimate.

51:04.461 --> 51:06.895
Yeah.

51:37.227 --> 51:40.822
Would that little monkey
of yours do this for you?

51:40.897 --> 51:45.857
Ooh! If there's an ape
in my life, it's you.

51:47.637 --> 51:51.038
- Get out of here!
- What did I do?

51:54.544 --> 51:58.571
<i>Of all the manipulative,
scum-sucking... Good night.</i>

51:58.648 --> 52:01.617
- Good night.
- I hate you, Eugene Palletto.

52:01.685 --> 52:03.619
So, eh...

52:05.689 --> 52:09.022
do we have to
stop dancing?

52:09.092 --> 52:11.026
- No.
- Nah.

52:19.536 --> 52:23.529
It's as if he wants me to be, like, this
perfect housewife, but we're not even married.

52:23.607 --> 52:25.541
It's so ridiculous.

52:25.609 --> 52:29.340
Then afterwards, you know, it's
really hard for me to be mad at him...

52:29.412 --> 52:32.347
- for too long because I love him so...
- But that's the point.

52:32.415 --> 52:35.942
The machine
creates the tension.

52:36.019 --> 52:38.681
- Bart?
- Hi.

52:38.755 --> 52:41.019
- Hi.
- What a surprise. What are you doing here?

52:41.091 --> 52:43.685
- I work here.
- Uh, that's right, that's right.

52:43.760 --> 52:46.456
- You have time for a coffee?
- Yeah.

52:46.530 --> 52:48.464
- Good. Let's go.
- Okay.

52:48.532 --> 52:51.467
Okay, guys, it was very nice
talking to you, huh?

52:51.535 --> 52:53.469
<i>- Bye-bye.
- All right. Bye.</i>

52:53.537 --> 52:55.471
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

52:55.539 --> 52:58.736
Unfortunately, they don't emphasize
technique these days.

52:58.808 --> 53:02.107
Perfect. You can smother an idea
with technique.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.979
But these kids have things in their heads
they can't get down on paper.

53:06.049 --> 53:08.540
What good is an idea
if it stays up here?

53:08.618 --> 53:11.178
You might as well be
an artist who doesn't paint.

53:11.254 --> 53:14.018
Now, that's my definition
of a coward.

53:19.629 --> 53:22.496
Are you working now?

53:22.566 --> 53:24.500
I can't seem to stop.

53:24.568 --> 53:26.729
I'd love to see
some of your work.

53:26.803 --> 53:30.136
But you just got here,
so there's probably nothing to show yet.

53:30.207 --> 53:33.938
Actually, I shipped
a few pieces here and...

53:34.010 --> 53:36.171
Really?

53:36.246 --> 53:39.238
- If you got a little time...
- Now is good.

53:39.316 --> 53:41.648
- Now?
- Yeah.

53:41.718 --> 53:44.585
Um, okay, great, great.
Uh...

53:44.654 --> 53:49.523
Just, uh, let me make a call,
and we're on our way.

53:49.593 --> 53:51.527
Okay.

53:55.565 --> 53:58.159
Manny, it's Art.
Listen.

53:58.235 --> 54:02.035
You've got to come over to the gallery.
People are going nuts about you.

54:02.105 --> 54:04.972
<i>Art's Gallery.</i>

54:05.041 --> 54:09.102
Gloria, it's me. This is crucial.
You gotta do me a favor.

54:09.179 --> 54:12.512
- Oh, joy.
- Look, Manny'll be there any minute.

54:12.582 --> 54:15.517
- Is he gonna be a twin too?
- This is not a game.

54:15.585 --> 54:19.544
- Keep him there for an hour.
- How do you propose I do that?

54:19.623 --> 54:24.060
<i>Use your charm.</i>

54:45.915 --> 54:48.383
<i>- I'm nervous. Uh...
- Don't be.</i>

54:49.686 --> 54:52.621
<i>You're the first person
to see them in a long time.</i>

54:58.228 --> 55:00.822
They are no big deal,
really.

55:00.897 --> 55:03.695
<i>Bart, they're very good.
I like them.</i>

55:03.767 --> 55:06.668
I like them a lot.

55:07.737 --> 55:09.637
Good.

55:14.911 --> 55:18.677
- Is that yours?
- Yeah.

55:18.748 --> 55:21.546
- I love that.
- Yeah?

55:23.019 --> 55:25.317
It's beautiful.
You know why?

55:25.388 --> 55:27.288
No.

55:27.357 --> 55:30.349
It's both simple
and heartfelt.

55:40.770 --> 55:42.761
Keep it.

55:42.839 --> 55:46.605
- What? Are you kidding?
- Take it. My gift.

55:46.676 --> 55:50.043
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Of course you can.

55:50.113 --> 55:52.138
I want you to have it.

55:52.215 --> 55:57.416
Please.

56:03.827 --> 56:06.887
Oh, I love this.

56:06.963 --> 56:09.557
Good.

56:19.809 --> 56:21.743
Well, I better go.

57:29.379 --> 57:32.177
You were very talented.

57:32.248 --> 57:36.207
<i>Todavia no se porque lo
dejaste. Este es muy bueno.</i>

58:00.410 --> 58:02.776
- Hi.
- How was your swim?

58:19.829 --> 58:22.389
Art's Gallery.

58:22.465 --> 58:25.366
Gloria, any messages
for me?

58:25.435 --> 58:28.666
Hillerman. He read about your, "merger
with the Kerner fortune..."

58:28.738 --> 58:30.933
is, I believe,
how he put it...

58:31.007 --> 58:33.874
- so he's raising the rent.
- Any other calls?

58:33.943 --> 58:35.968
One, but it's not
for you.

58:36.045 --> 58:38.980
If you see your brother Bart,
tell him I have a message for him.

58:39.048 --> 58:41.175
Wait, wait, wait!

58:47.156 --> 58:50.421
<i>Art's Gallery.</i>

58:50.493 --> 58:54.486
Gloria, this is Bart.
Do I have any calls?

58:54.564 --> 58:58.159
As it happens, a certain
Liz Kerner called.

58:58.234 --> 59:00.327
She said
she'd call back.

59:00.403 --> 59:03.133
Bart, I'm worried
about your brother.

59:03.206 --> 59:05.902
You should be, Gloria.
We'll discuss it later.

59:07.977 --> 59:10.502
I'm going to fix myself
a drink.

59:10.580 --> 59:13.674
<i>- Anybody want anything?
- I'd love a vodka tonic.</i>

59:13.750 --> 59:16.218
<i>- Liz, what about you?
- No, thanks.</i>

59:18.488 --> 59:21.855
No, Hopper, it's not me. It's not me.

59:42.979 --> 59:45.413
<i>No, cancel that order! Excuse me.</i>

59:45.481 --> 59:48.245
Maria, could you use another phone?
Thank you.

59:48.318 --> 59:51.082
What? What?
No, forget it!

59:51.154 --> 59:53.679
<i>Don't accept those conditions.</i>

59:53.756 --> 59:56.782
Hello?

59:56.859 --> 01:00:00.454
This is Bart Dodge.
May I speak to Liz, please?

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:06.961
- Hello?
- Liz? It's Bart.

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:09.129
- You called?
- Yeah.

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:11.730
We were having kind of
a lazy day here and...

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:14.743
You want to come by?
Your brother's here.

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:17.803
Can't make it
this afternoon.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.976
Oh, how about dinner, then?
Just the two of us.

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:25.316
Sure. Good.
Much better.

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:27.583
9:00 okay?

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:31.491
- Can you make it a bit later?
- 9:30, then.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.826
Let's compromise. 10:00.

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:37.764
Okay. You want to
talk to Art?

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.325
Sure. Put him on.

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:42.837
Okay, hold on a second.
Art!

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:56.017
- Phone for you. It's your brother.
- Oh.

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:58.076
- Can you hold that?
- Yeah.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:01.089
Thanks. Thanks.

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:03.091
Um, Bart?

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:09.025
That's no problem.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:12.932
Sounds great. Yeah, well.
See you later.

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:15.436
Bye.

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:19.367
Yeah.
I forgot the ice.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.384
- Here you are.
- Hmm. Thank you.

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.721
How's Bart?

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:35.758
Bart. Bart's fine.
He's fine.

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:39.852
<i>Very happy, actually.</i>

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:44.229
Eh, Betty, I got a problem
making dinner tonight, uh...

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.495
Miss this dinner,
my darling...

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:49.697
and your problems
are just beginning.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:10.657
- Oh, la, la, monsieur.
- What?

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.719
If you permit me to say, you
are committing a hideous crime.

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:17.664
Doctors orders. It's the only
way she can take her medicine.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:22.034
Monsieur, that is
a Chateau Fontegnac.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.699
This is not a wine
to toy with.

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:27.504
<i>- Pardon.
- Look, buddy, it's my wine.</i>

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.511
I paid for it.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.446
Now, if I want to piss in it,
that's my business.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:35.951
<i>- Okay?
- As you wish, monsieur.</i>

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.286
<i>Espece de cochon.</i>

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:51.390
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.938
Thank you.

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.435
Cheers.

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.309
<i>Arriba. Abajo.</i>

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.974
<i>- Al centro.
- Por dentro.</i>

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:10.018
Whatever.

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:21.390
Mmm. Oof.

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:03.735
Ohh, Art,
I love you.

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:06.240
Hmm.

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:08.243
I know.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.353
I'm sorry.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:04.427
Huh.

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:11.005
I wanted to see if, um...

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.578
Aiieee! Ai, ai, ai!

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.693
It's always raining
when you need a cab.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.738
Uh... do you think Art has
anything I could change into?

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.739
Upstairs?

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:46.900
Are you hungry?

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.245
Famished.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:56.308
- Here?
- Yeah. Do you know it?

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:58.819
I had dinner here
not too long ago.

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:11.266
It's okay.

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:15.833
- People sure stare at you.
- No, they're looking at you.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:22.071
<i>Nice to see you again,
monsieur.</i>

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:24.635
Eh, we'd like
a bottle of wine.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.342
<i>Eh, Chateau Fontegnac.</i>

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:31.845
Alas, monsieur,
I am desolated.

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:34.617
<i>Some person...</i>

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.420
<i>has committed an atrocity...</i>

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:40.018
against
the very last bottle.

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:44.032
<i>I think if you take a careful look in
the cellar, you'll find another one.</i>

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.467
<i>Certainement, monsieur.</i>

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:50.096
If you promise not
to piss in it.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:57.207
- He's French.
- They shouldn't let him out of the cellar.

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.213
Yeah.

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:03.217
So, um, your sister...

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.583
my brother.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:09.715
Think we'll be dancing at
their 50th wedding anniversary?

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.056
I have no idea.

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:16.588
She might just marry him twice and then
move on to the next lucky contestant.

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:20.692
You know,
Art is a little worried.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:24.672
He thinks they might
be rushing things and...

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:28.506
<i>It's too late now. The
Titanic has already sailed.</i>

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:32.673
Maybe you can talk to Betty
about it, be the voice of reason.

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:35.842
The only voice Betty listens
to is the call of the wild.

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:38.716
Yes.

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:06.174
Perfect.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.840
Hmm.

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.657
<i>- Thank you.
- Je vous en prie.</i>

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:32.098
Psst!

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:35.301
Shall I distract the lady
now while you slip...

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:37.777
a little something
into her wine?

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:41.408
<i>What a character, huh?</i>

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.417
You really crack me up.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.546
<i>Oh, dites donc.</i>

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.292
To you.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:59.133
- I hope we can be friends.
- We'll have to be.

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:02.328
We'll be related, almost
like brother and sister.

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.304
Right.

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:06.738
You don't like the idea?

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.971
Yeah, yeah.
It's just that, uh...

01:09:10.045 --> 01:09:14.277
this makes what I'm thinking
about taboo in most civilizations.

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:30.595
Would you like
to come in?

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:34.135
Maybe I should
go home.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.502
Nobody's waiting up
for you, are they?

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:45.273
So to top it all off...

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:48.544
he shoots his underpants
over the shower door to me.

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.676
No, I don't believe it.

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:53.517
Poor guy.
What a way to start a day.

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.523
How about me?

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:58.321
Well, you were
taking a shower.

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:01.158
I mean, he was the one
humping the glass door.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.664
He must have been
terribly humiliated.

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:06.064
Right. I was
just violated.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:09.161
Not you.
You are too tough.

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:13.040
Tough?

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:41.702
Too tough?

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:19.200
No, no, no.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.675
No, Betty.

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:24.474
No, Betty, no, no.

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.480
No, no.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:29.415
No, no!

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:37.357
You were dreaming about my sister.

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:41.021
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:44.429
When we were growing up, every
boyfriend I had had a crush on her.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.196
Did that sound like
a good dream?

01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:50.102
- Hmm?
- No, I guess not.

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:55.370
Ohh!
I was at the wedding.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:00.904
It was a nightmare.
I was the...

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:04.214
The best man...

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:07.414
and I couldn't move.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:11.391
And then...
there you were...

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.394
Beautiful and perfect.

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:16.659
Let's just forget
about Betty and Art.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:19.997
Yeah.
Let's forget 'em.

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:22.594
Yeah.

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:30.034
Where are you going?

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:34.173
To splash some cold water
on my face.

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.255
Hmm.

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:21.663
Hmm. Ohh, God.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.563
I have this
incredible headache.

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:30.127
- Me too.
- You do?

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:33.072
I think I need
an aspirin. Yeah.

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.713
- Oh.
- Good morning.

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:40.715
Good morning.

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:47.887
Aspirin. Aspirin.
Yeah.

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.510
<i>Bart?</i>

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:17.081
I'll be right out.

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:34.301
Oh, I feel like
my head's gonna pop...

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:37.532
<i>like I've been in a coma
or something.</i>

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.540
Will you rub my neck
for a minute?

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:41.508
<i>- Neck? Yeah, yeah.
- Please?</i>

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:43.511
Thanks.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:49.079
Did I drink a lot
last night?

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.085
Well...

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:56.858
- Right.
- What's wrong?

01:14:56.925 --> 01:15:01.555
Forgot the aspirin. We both
had too much last night.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.791
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.145
Ohh!

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:26.384
<i>Hey, what took you
so long?</i>

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:29.185
- l-I-I-I hopped in the shower.
- I need one too.

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:32.193
- I'm late for work.
- Yeah, and...

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:53.173
<i>Art?</i>

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:59.253
<i>Art!</i>

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:08.521
Whew! Ohh.

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.966
- You're not dressed yet.
- No.

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:23.978
I think I'm going to
take a shower.

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:25.980
Another one?

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:28.380
Yeah, I forgot, uh,
my ankles.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.994
Ooh! Aah! Ow!

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:52.940
<i>- You up?
- Didn't you hear me calling you?</i>

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.168
Soap in my ears.

01:16:57.245 --> 01:17:00.112
Did I leave the water on?
Yeah.

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:02.343
<i>Ohh.</i>

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:34.378
Ohh!

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.688
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.724
I gotta go,
but you stay.

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:46.522
- I'll have Maria make you breakfast.
- Yeah. That's okay.

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:50.031
I'd better be off. I don't
want to run into Bart... Art!

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.992
- I'll call you later.
- Sure.

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:08.082
Bye.

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:42.281
Art?

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.217
- Art!
- What?

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:51.291
I'm leaving now.

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.293
I have a date.

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:56.421
You're on the 9:00 to Puerto Vallarta.

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:58.432
Um...

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.434
I-I'm just going to
fall back and...

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:06.132
regroup for a while
and...

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.233
make a plan.

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.301
Dumping one sister
at the altar...

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:13.313
and leaving the other
with a cheap one-night stand?

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:16.509
That's some fine plan.

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.519
You should
write that down.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:22.614
You know...
1,000 ways to humiliate...

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:26.127
degrade, generally make
everyone miserable.

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.296
See ya.

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:45.008
<i>- All right.
- I'm gonna play these ones.</i>

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.516
- Give me...
- You want two fives still?

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:50.642
I'll take one.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:53.984
<i>- What you got?
- I'll take one.</i>

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.559
<i>- I'll take two.
- You're taking two?</i>

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:00.561
<i>- Two I'm taking.
- All right.</i>

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.564
<i>- Give me one.
- I'll take one.</i>

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:07.534
- Hey, wait a minute. That's my card.
- What's the matter with you?

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:09.832
Hey, hey, hey.
I need your help.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:13.500
- I saw you pull an ace out of your shoe.
- I didn't do it!

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:17.238
- I'm in a jam. You gotta help me.
- I can't. I'm in a hole.

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:21.146
This is serious. You gotta go
out, start the car and wait for me.

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:25.312
- Let me finish this hand.
- There is no time. Someone is after me.

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:28.515
- Cool! Way better than poker.
- Better than poker!

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.821
Where's my hat?

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:34.191
<i>I'm coming, I'm coming!</i>

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:37.493
- Come on, boys! I don't wanna be late!
- Okay! Go, go!

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.693
- The car is right here.
- Move, move!

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.827
- All right.
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:45.100
<i>- I'm bad at driving.
- Who's driving? Who's driving?</i>

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:46.868
Just get in.

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:50.537
<i>Okay, let's go, let's go.</i>

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:54.709
All right,
get back in there.

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:57.843
<i>You remember how, don't ya?
- Of course I do.</i>

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:00.911
Idiot son of mine. Who else
would own a stick shift?

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:04.789
It's like making love to a woman...
put it in slowly and then floor it.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.454
<i>What do you know?
You haven't even got a license!</i>

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:10.692
<i>- It's only because I can't see.
- What are you doing? It's not even raining!</i>

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:13.165
I don't know.
Wait a minute. Something...

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.905
<i>I don't understand!</i>

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:20.567
<i>All right!</i>

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:28.476
Move! Move! Let's go!

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.451
Come on!

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:33.316
- There!
- Hey! Now you're talking!

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.556
Take it slowly!

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:47.131
- Go back to
the home, you old farts!

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:49.432
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:57.771
<i>Positively Homeric!</i>

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:01.111
<i>- I can't, I'm telling you!
- I'm telling you! I'm telling you!</i>

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:03.707
<i>: El embrague!: El
El embrague!</i>

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:06.151
<i>Eso, eso! Alli, arriba!</i>

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:11.154
Taxi!

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:28.999
- Hey! They're coming!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:31.011
No! Hey!

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:56.301
I can't concentrate
on these pedals!

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:58.305
I'll steer!
Just step on it!

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.334
Come on!

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:05.140
It's all right!
Look out!

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:12.548
Keep going! Keep going!
Keep going! Stomp on it!

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:23.757
There's a valley in Spain
called Jarama

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:27.529
It's a place that
we all know so well

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:31.561
It was there that we gave
of our manhood

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:35.006
Where so many of
our brave comrades fell

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:37.442
<i>Viva la República!</i>

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:40.777
<i>Go, go! We can make it!</i>

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.750
Aaah! Stop!
We're gonna die!

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:47.447
Relax! lt'll be fine! I've
seen it done a thousand times!

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.717
Not in real life!

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:03.068
Yes! Yes! We done it!

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:38.269
- All right, all right.
- Let him out.

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:41.274
- I think I can do it.
- One leg at a time.

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:43.776
- My behind is broken.
- I got it, I got it.

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:48.305
- I'll never dance again. I know it.
- Okay, you guys go ahead.

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:50.317
I'll get the car back
tomorrow, all right?

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:52.945
And hey, hey...
Thanks.

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:57.515
Son, don't let that asshole brother
of yours get you into any more trouble.

01:24:57.592 --> 01:25:00.083
Next time you have a problem,
call me.

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:02.129
- These guys are useless.
- I will.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:06.327
<i>- Avanti.
- We are proud of the Lincoln Battalion</i>

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:10.531
And the fight for Madrid
that we made

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:14.564
There we fought like true sons
of the people

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:18.544
As part of
the 15th Brigade

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:41.660
- Art.
- I know you hate me, but can I come in?

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:43.670
I'm not alone.

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:48.241
- Manny.
- Hi, Art.

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:51.938
I-I took your advice
about the charm.

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:55.710
- So maybe I got a little carried away.
- I'll say.

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:59.378
- Well, uh...
- Is, uh, something the matter?

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:03.390
Um, I was just looking for a quiet place
to spend the night, but, uh...

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:08.150
<i>- It wouldn't be here, would it?
- Wait a second.</i>

01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:10.754
You and... Manny?

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:14.063
When I said his brush strokes
spoke volumes...

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:16.501
I had no idea.

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:19.665
- You know what else?
- No, please. Don't tell me.

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:23.210
Key to the studio.

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:26.213
<i>- You can spend the night there.
- Thanks, Manny.</i>

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:41.328
Who is it?

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:49.202
Hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.204
Wait, wait, wait...
Aah!

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:54.605
- Are you guys crazy or what, huh?
- I think we're "what."

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:15.195
Wait. Wait...

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.130
Aaah!

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:26.606
<i>- Uh... no.
- Not his face!</i>

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:34.681
We want the groom
to look pretty tomorrow.

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.444
<i>- He might not dance so good.
- Look...</i>

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:41.852
I am leaving. She's all yours.

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:46.622
Yeah, schmucks like you always
bail out at the last minute...

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.889
no matter who
takes the fall.

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:51.363
Luckily I'm here
to protect Betty.

01:27:54.168 --> 01:27:57.626
You started somethin',
and you're gonna finish it.

01:27:57.705 --> 01:28:00.640
You're gonna go there
and marry her tomorrow...

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:04.337
and what's more,
you're gonna make her happy.

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:08.508
Because, so help me,
if you ever make Betty cry...

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:12.610
I'm gonna break one bone
for every tear.

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:15.281
And you know
she cries a lot.

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:26.122
I just gotta get rid of all
of this negative energy!

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.168
<i>- Doctor's orders!
- Not his face, boss!</i>

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:32.803
<i>- Who says?
- Uh, you did, boss.</i>

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:34.899
- You did, boss.
- Y-you did.

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:43.443
You always gotta listen
to the boss.

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:10.210
Oh, my God.

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:16.783
<i>Bart?</i>

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:23.152
Oh, my...

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:25.215
Are you all right?

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:27.227
<i>- Ohh!
- I've been better.</i>

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:30.355
Ohh.
Here, let me help you.

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:33.093
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:36.603
- It's all right.
- Is something broken?

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:39.640
- A rib, maybe.
- Owwie.

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.867
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:44.878
We should call somebody.

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:50.116
What?

01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:52.118
You're so...

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:55.722
Iovely.

01:29:56.824 --> 01:29:59.793
- Please be quiet.
- No, no. I mean it.

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.795
When you are like this...

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:05.398
Frowning...

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:08.668
It is fantastic.

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:17.069
Um, I am very happy
you came.

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.324
I think
you're getting better.

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.328
Ooh.

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:37.330
Tell me what happened.

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:39.628
What happened?

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.861
I love you, Liz.

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:45.905
That's what happened.

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:51.336
From the moment
I laid eyes on you...

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:56.281
when I stepped
in the shower...

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:58.284
and there you were...

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.287
glaring at me
through the water.

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.653
- That was Art.
- Yeah.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:06.352
I am Art.

01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:10.090
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's not a joke. It's not a joke.

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:18.204
- All right, what does Betty keep on her night table?
- Uh...

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:22.299
Five bottles of pills
and...

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:24.435
three boxes of Kleenex
and...

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:27.680
a beautiful picture
of you.

01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:30.478
- I can't believe this.
- Sure you can.

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:32.542
Sure you can.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.054
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, I can.

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:38.751
I believe you can betray Bart like this,
betray my sister, betray me...

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:42.557
No, the person I've betrayed the most...
is myself.

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.564
Why?
Because you stopped?

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:47.430
Because you could've
gotten away with it?

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:50.437
- Yeah, you really blew it.
- I want you to be with me.

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:53.531
Not with someone else.

01:31:57.311 --> 01:32:00.041
You know...

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:02.048
I've always loved you.

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:11.090
- Don't.
- Please.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.794
- Don't do this.
- Please, please. Please.

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:08.348
You know what
I'm thinking about?

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:10.350
Your mother.

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:13.353
I'm sure she'd give you
a good whipping.

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.355
You sure as hell
deserve one.

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.357
Yeah.

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.292
I remember when
you and Bart were born.

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:22.295
She cried
for a whole month.

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:03.202
<i>You sure someone who lives in
this house wants to marry you?</i>

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:06.034
<i>Not me, Dad.
Art. Art!</i>

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:10.976
What amazes me is that Art doesn't want
to marry someone who lives in this house.

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:12.979
What made you
change your mind?

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:15.607
I don't know whether
to laugh or cry.

01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:17.617
- Congratulations.
- No, Manny.

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:20.279
I am not the one
who's getting married.

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:22.845
It's my brother Art.
You follow?

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.392
- Yeah, sure.
- Bart.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.725
My name is Bart.
Bart.

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:35.865
We could speak
to the preacher.

01:34:35.936 --> 01:34:38.871
I'm sure he'd marry us
on the spot.

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:41.874
I'd love to, but you're just
too young and foolish for me.

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:50.516
Bart.

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:52.518
Hi.

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:57.185
- Hi.
- Um...

01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:59.192
- What?
- I have to tell you something.

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.524
But I don't want you to get angry.
Promise me.

01:35:01.595 --> 01:35:06.658
- I could never be angry with you.
- Not with me, with your brother.

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:11.398
- What?
- He told me that he loved me last night.

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:14.373
- Well...
- You promised.

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:17.104
We can't let him
marry Betty.

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:21.780
Great.

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:25.216
What you do now is tell Betty
what you just told me.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.454
Right.
You're right.

01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:30.319
Yeah.

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.383
It's just that
it's so hurtful.

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:35.952
A-And you...
I'm really sorry.

01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:37.964
I know, I know, I know.

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:43.002
Liz.

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:46.963
Do you feel anything
for Art?

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:51.810
No.

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:54.814
How did things
get so screwed up?

01:36:25.045 --> 01:36:26.979
I gotta get these
checked.

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.951
I saw Art last night...

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:37.650
<i>and he said some things
that made it clear...</i>

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:42.059
that he's not ready for the kind
of commitment that you deserve.

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:46.295
Well, I think he is.

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:51.831
He said he's had feelings for
me since the day he met me.

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:56.002
No offense, Lizzie, but your record
with men is really not all that great.

01:36:56.076 --> 01:37:00.172
<i>You've never known how to read them
and you still don't.</i>

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:03.478
He said... he loved me.

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.883
Well, I'm sure
that he does.

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:07.887
He kissed me.

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:10.890
There.
I kissed you too.

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:13.893
But that doesn't mean
that I'm in love with you.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.334
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:27.997
- Art?
- Yes, Manny, yes.

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:33.069
I'm glad you could make it. One more
Dodge and we can have a used car lot.

01:37:33.147 --> 01:37:35.274
<i>You knew Ernest Hemingway
personally?</i>

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:38.045
<i>- Hi.
- Yes. We played golf together.</i>

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:40.609
<i>- Uh, see you later, huh?
- Hemingway never hit the front lines...</i>

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.919
until the only people aiming at him
were the photographers.

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:49.962
<i>I mean no.</i>

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:52.965
So, my dear, just relax
and follow your instincts.

01:37:53.033 --> 01:37:56.969
Fly in the sky, free like a bird.

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.306
What have you done?

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:03.866
Don't you know that it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding?

01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:06.378
Um... I'm sorry.

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:09.883
We're not gonna have
bad luck, are we?

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:12.441
Hmm?

01:38:12.519 --> 01:38:16.011
'Cause I just want
everybody to be happy.

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:27.399
So, you must be
the famous Art.

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.402
Dr. Huffeyer,
I presume.

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:31.404
Huffeyer. A pleasure.
Yes. Right.

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:34.407
Betty talks about you
all the time.

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:37.410
I have to admit I'm even
just a little bit jealous.

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:42.541
What you have achieved in a very short time
I haven't come close to in years of treatment.

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:45.551
What a beautiful ring.
Where did you find it?

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:48.554
You're not going to believe this,
but it fell from heaven.

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:52.490
Ah. Does it say "Love you, Huffy"
on the inside?

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:54.493
It's... It's...
It's my ring.

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:56.495
- I need it.
- Sorry... Sorry, Doctor.

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:58.497
See you later, eh?

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:02.768
Are you really going to
go through with this?

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:04.770
Any reason I shouldn't?

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:10.505
- Bart's looking for you everywhere.
- Is he?

01:39:10.577 --> 01:39:13.512
- He wants to talk to you.
- He told you that?

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:16.481
Yes. Now stay here.
It's incredibly important.

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:19.417
- He told you that too?
- Yes.

01:39:19.486 --> 01:39:23.650
I'm gonna go get him. You
just wait here. Don't move.

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:28.060
Did you tell Betty
about last night?

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.188
You... Ohh.

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.847
Ohh!

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:08.032
<i>Grow up!</i>

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:20.105
- Hello?
- Maria.

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:24.173
- Um, get me Dr. Huffeyer.
- I'll check the garden, miss. Hold on one second.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.881
Bart. Bart, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:40:29.957 --> 01:40:34.018
Betty won't listen to me.
You have to convince Art to call it off.

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:37.222
- Right.
- No, no, this way. This way.

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:39.356
Bye.

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:44.359
So what is the big deal?
What do you want me to do?

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:48.101
- Hold up the ceremony?
- I won't let him make my sister unhappy.

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:50.109
Is that
the only reason?

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:54.210
Okay.

01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:56.715
I-I'm gonna look for him
right now.

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:59.218
He's waiting for you.

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:01.550
Here?

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.058
Mmm. Mmm.

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.364
Art?

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.667
Art.

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.770
Look, man.

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:25.101
You can't do this to Betty.
You've got to call it off.

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.371
You amaze me.

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:32.783
You just show up after four years,
and right away you launch into sermons?

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:34.878
<i>- Geez, Bart!
- Art?</i>

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:37.389
<i>- Sermon, my ass.
- Bart?</i>

01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:40.393
You are about to make the all-time
biggest possible mistake, and you know it.

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:44.227
And look at me when I am talking to you! You
are going to make Betty totally miserable.

01:41:44.298 --> 01:41:47.290
<i>Everything is
so damned simple for you.</i>

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:51.326
Look, in two days,
you've got everything...

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:53.771
everything
I've always wanted.

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:58.210
<i>Your problem is, you've never
known what you've wanted.</i>

01:41:58.278 --> 01:41:59.643
Hello!

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:08.548
Maybe I don't know
what I want...

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:11.716
but at least I don't run away
every time there is a problem!

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:24.295
Did he think
he could pull this off?

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:28.774
Does your brother think I'm
brain-dead? Shut up! Don't answer that!

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:32.243
I could change my mind
and croak you right here!

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:36.305
Gene. Listen good.
I mean, Bart is right.

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:40.547
<i>You are the one who is in love with
Betty, and you're telling me to marry her?</i>

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:45.957
- It doesn't make any sense.
- When was the last time things made any sense?

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:50.019
What you want, what I want,
isn't worth squat.

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:53.965
The only thing that matters here
is what Betty wants...

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:57.197
And what she wants is you.

01:42:57.271 --> 01:43:00.707
And so help me God, she's going
to get you, probably not for long.

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:04.403
See, guys like you, you come and go.
You're just a temp!

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:09.114
But I'm forever...

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:14.612
because I...
I really love her.

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:20.755
So now, pal...

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:24.058
You and I got a date
with fate...

01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:26.895
- All right.
- At the altar.

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:32.935
Are you ready, dear?

01:43:33.006 --> 01:43:36.965
<i>"Wedding March"]
- [Guests Murmuring]</i>

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:39.308
<i>She looks gorgeous.</i>

01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:42.610
Cheer up, dear boy.
It's a wedding, not an execution.

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:28.826
<i>Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here...</i>

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:31.955
before our Lord God
and this company...

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:35.798
<i>to unite this man
and this woman...</i>

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:38.702
<i>in the bonds
ofholy matrimony...</i>

01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:41.764
to join this couple
together...

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:44.606
until... death.

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:48.079
<i>Seeing some of those present...</i>

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:51.447
Lord, you must
be thinking...

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:56.319
"I've seen these faces
somewhere before."

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:02.956
Let us remember...

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:05.931
the solemnity
of this ceremony.

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:09.958
<i>Listen to my questions...</i>

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:13.939
<i>and give thought
to all of your answers.</i>

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:16.669
<i>If anyone knows any reason...</i>

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:20.577
<i>these two people should not
bejoined in marriage...</i>

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:24.777
speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:37.290
I do.

01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:43.864
No, dear. Remember?

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:46.633
<i>- That comes later.
- No.</i>

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.214
You pig!

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:58.547
You worthless, selfish
son of a bitch!

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:01.883
- You only think of yourself!
All the time!

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:05.220
<i>You may be rich,
but you're a creep, and I love you!</i>

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:09.625
I do love you.

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:55.502
No, Hopper. Not now.

01:46:56.977 --> 01:46:59.411
You son of a bitch.

01:47:27.507 --> 01:47:30.442
What would Freud
have made of this?

01:47:54.267 --> 01:47:56.827
I couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

01:47:56.903 --> 01:48:00.270
<i>Uh, I've gotta
go back to Italy.</i>

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:04.436
Responsibilities.

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.807
I have kids.

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:11.407
<i>Three boys.</i>

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:13.544
Three?

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.952
Yeah.

01:48:16.022 --> 01:48:18.513
Three little bambinos.

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:22.428
Luigi and Paolo
and, and...

01:48:22.496 --> 01:48:24.964
<i>- Gi...
- Giuseppe?</i>

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:27.932
<i>- Giulio.
- Giulio.</i>

01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:30.299
Is there a wife?

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:34.238
<i>Hate the woman.
I haven't spoken to her for years.</i>

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:37.572
The boys live with their grandma.

01:48:39.012 --> 01:48:42.846
But yesterday the old lady
fell down the stairs and...

01:48:42.916 --> 01:48:45.510
Dead?

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:49.214
Paralyzed...
from the neck down.

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:55.951
Well...

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:57.963
good-bye.

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:01.292
I'm sorry.

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:03.563
Give my love to Art.

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:09.398
He's not good enough
for you.

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.511
Neither am I.

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:23.718
Good-bye, Liz.

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:27.785
Good-bye...

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:34.499
Art.

01:49:44.110 --> 01:49:46.578
All right, now!

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:49.479
Yea!

01:50:17.577 --> 01:50:20.171
You really should...

01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:25.016
See you around.

01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:28.543
- Okay. See you, see you. How are you doing?
- Fine.

01:50:28.622 --> 01:50:31.386
<i>I love the show. Bye.</i>

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:36.521
Well, uh...

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:39.224
congratulations.

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:42.427
The gallery's gonna do much better
with you running it.

01:50:42.502 --> 01:50:47.269
- Well, I think I have a better eye for talent.
- You're referring to me?

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:51.367
But there's one client I think you
should handle personally.

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:58.448
There is only
one true work of art...

01:50:58.518 --> 01:51:02.249
in this whole room...
you.

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:17.632
See you later, kids.

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:24.702
Hello.

01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:28.046
Hello.

01:51:30.383 --> 01:51:34.410
I've been told this painting's
not for sale.

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:37.650
It already has an owner.

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:41.057
I don't think she,
she cares about it anymore.

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:43.459
I knew the artist.

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:46.897
I doubt it.

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:50.129
You and him don't move
in the same circles.

01:51:50.203 --> 01:51:53.536
Maybe I'm talking
to the wrong person.

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:02.273
I'm sorry.

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:04.748
Oh, God.

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:08.447
The first time I set eyes on
you, everything else faded away.

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:12.753
I mean, from that moment on,
for me there was only you.

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:15.090
Only me?

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:18.096
<i>You mean my sister first
and then me.</i>

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:21.759
- You had a pretty good deal there, admit it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:24.963
Do you honestly think I was having fun?
I mean, think about it.

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:28.064
- Why did you lie to me?
- Because you never gave me a chance.

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:32.635
Because I couldn't stand being rejected
and then seeing you fall in love with Bart.

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:35.977
<i>- You are Bart!
- No, Bart doesn't exist!</i>

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:38.381
All right.
You miss Bart?

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:41.386
I'll stop being Art,
and I'll be Bart.

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:44.150
You really are a brick short,
aren't you?

01:52:44.224 --> 01:52:47.387
From the moment I met you.

01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:51.892
Art already told me that.
Or was that Bart?

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:55.059
Just tell me,
who do you want me to be?

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:27.365
So was that
Art or Bart?

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:31.369
Just me.
