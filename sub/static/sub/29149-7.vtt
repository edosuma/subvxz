10:15.975 --> 10:17.891
W... We'd rather you stayed here.

10:17.892 --> 10:19.891
I've got this pathetically weak bladder.

10:19.892 --> 10:22.349
I'm like an old woman
who's had a baby somehow.

10:22.350 --> 10:23.558
- So, I'm gonna...
- KENNETH: Well...

10:23.559 --> 10:24.632
But I'm... I'm so sorry.

10:24.633 --> 10:26.433
- I'll be right back. Okay.
- (LAWYERS MUMBLE)

10:29.767 --> 10:33.099
Who's the pilot today? Not Serge, right?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.808
- No, sir. Serge is off rotation.
- LOGAN: Good.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.391
I like a boring bastard flying me.

10:38.392 --> 10:40.725
Serge always looks as
if his dick's still wet,

10:40.726 --> 10:43.350
and he's gonna give me the
name of a good fucking pinot.

10:51.809 --> 10:53.224
Are you all right, son?

10:53.225 --> 10:56.182
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm
good. Thanks for the ride.

10:56.183 --> 10:58.182
LOGAN: It's good to see you.

10:58.183 --> 11:01.058
Good to see you, too, Dad. I
hope we can swing it with Mom.

11:03.058 --> 11:05.057
Yeah, I... I was gonna say,

11:05.058 --> 11:07.683
you know, that thing up at Argestes...

11:07.684 --> 11:11.891
Oh. No, yeah. Mm-mm. It's not...

11:11.892 --> 11:13.974
I... I didn't even know you were there.

11:13.975 --> 11:16.600
I mean, if I did, I would... Y'know?

11:16.601 --> 11:19.017
Oh, I know. Yeah, I know. Sure.

11:22.350 --> 11:24.308
Did I even make contact?

11:24.309 --> 11:28.224
Um... I don't... think s...

11:28.225 --> 11:30.391
Yeah, I'm not quite sure
what we're talking about,

11:30.392 --> 11:32.100
- to be honest.
- Because...

11:33.183 --> 11:36.641
that's not something I'd do. Y'know?

11:36.642 --> 11:40.642
Yeah, I know. I know
that. I know. I know.

11:45.642 --> 11:46.726
Fucking...

11:47.767 --> 11:51.933
cars, buildings, everywhere.

11:53.225 --> 11:55.808
RHEA JARRELL: He didn't
tell you I was coming?

11:55.809 --> 11:57.433
No. No, he did not.

11:57.434 --> 12:00.342
For a media guy, he's not
the greatest communicator.

12:00.892 --> 12:02.191
RHEA: Thank you.

12:02.192 --> 12:04.766
I was going anyway to check
out some theater, and he asked

12:04.767 --> 12:07.141
would I talk through a
couple things with him.

12:07.142 --> 12:08.683
- Bounce some stuff.
- KENDALL: Uh-huh.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.684
- You feelin' bouncy?
- Honestly?

12:11.392 --> 12:13.266
A little deflated.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.182
After all the retreats I've done,

12:15.183 --> 12:17.433
you know, still got a bit of an ego.

12:17.434 --> 12:19.099
Uh-huh.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.808
Hey! Hi! (CHUCKLING)

12:21.809 --> 12:23.183
(CHUCKLING) Hey!

12:25.017 --> 12:27.600
Oh. Hey, Rhea.

12:27.601 --> 12:30.474
- Dad, Rhea's here.
- LOGAN: Yeah, well...

12:30.475 --> 12:31.974
Not a big deal.

12:31.975 --> 12:34.308
ROMAN: Course it's not a
big deal. Why would it be?

12:34.309 --> 12:37.433
- LOGAN: It's convenient.
- Okay, well, here we go.

12:37.434 --> 12:40.516
Roy boys on tour, and
we got 'em in all sizes.

12:40.517 --> 12:43.308
Alpha, beta, cuck.

12:43.309 --> 12:45.474
He's fucking leaving the country?

12:45.475 --> 12:47.057
Rather than speak to me.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.683
How long have you known this?

12:48.684 --> 12:51.057
Plans change, so...
He wanted to apologize.

12:51.058 --> 12:52.142
Bullshit.

12:52.975 --> 12:54.350
- TOM: Hey.
- You...

12:55.017 --> 12:56.266
Hey, Shiv. Hey.

12:56.267 --> 12:57.632
- Hey.
- What... Hey, oh...

12:57.633 --> 12:59.040
- Do you know he's gone?
- TOM: Can I ask you about something?

12:59.041 --> 13:00.439
Can you believe this? He's gone.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.474
And his fucking flunkies
didn't even tell me,

13:02.475 --> 13:04.766
running interference
for him. I won't have it.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.224
I'm not gonna chase him around the party

13:06.225 --> 13:07.850
like a schoolgirl with a crush.

13:07.851 --> 13:08.973
No, absolutely.

13:08.974 --> 13:11.683
Hey, um, I just wanted to
check it definitely is bullshit

13:11.684 --> 13:13.558
this... this internal investigation?

13:13.559 --> 13:15.308
Y'know, he hasn't even
responded to the memo.

13:15.309 --> 13:17.851
TOM: Because that didn't
feel all that bullshitty.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.016
It wasn't all softballs?

13:21.017 --> 13:23.057
You ever been hit in
the face with a softball?

13:23.058 --> 13:24.683
I mean, just how inside this are you?

13:24.684 --> 13:26.433
'Cause there isn't a world,
is there, in which I get

13:26.434 --> 13:28.766
hung out to dry, in which
I have to play the fuckbag?

13:28.767 --> 13:29.899
- Is there? I mean...
- No.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.358
... he supports me, right? Logan?

13:31.359 --> 13:33.099
I mean, never mind the
jokes and the "ha ha",

13:33.100 --> 13:35.099
he's not gonna fry me, is he?

13:35.100 --> 13:38.600
No, Tom. No. I... You know what?
I think I have to go out there.

13:38.601 --> 13:41.100
I have to... go and fix this, okay?

13:46.517 --> 13:47.559
You okay?

13:48.267 --> 13:49.683
Sure.

13:49.684 --> 13:52.016
RHEA: Oh, sure. "Sure".
Don't poke the bear.

13:52.017 --> 13:54.057
He can take anything. Load him up.

13:54.058 --> 13:56.516
Oh, I don't fucking know.

13:56.517 --> 13:59.600
All this energy. I'm
gonna have to fight now

13:59.601 --> 14:01.725
for every fucking shareholder vote.

14:01.726 --> 14:04.433
My ex-wife, my old friends turning.

14:04.434 --> 14:08.141
I kill Sandy. Sandy
kills me. So fucking what?

14:08.142 --> 14:10.099
The next Zucker-fucker comes along

14:10.100 --> 14:11.974
and swallows you whole.

14:11.975 --> 14:13.433
Shits you out as an app.

14:13.434 --> 14:15.099
(WEAKLY) Yeah...

14:15.100 --> 14:19.725
We've had some private
polling on potential next CEOs,

14:19.726 --> 14:21.141
who'd play well.

14:21.142 --> 14:22.850
I'd value your thoughts.

14:22.851 --> 14:24.349
On the kids?

14:24.350 --> 14:25.974
Who's got it? Huh?

14:25.975 --> 14:28.766
I... (CHUCKLES) I could
do with a clear eye.

14:28.767 --> 14:31.434
As execs, okay. Well...

14:33.434 --> 14:35.834
Shiv thinks she's smarter than she is.

14:36.517 --> 14:38.224
Roman could actually be good,

14:38.225 --> 14:39.392
but, um...

14:40.309 --> 14:42.099
but nowhere near right now.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.932
Kendall's... I don't know.

14:43.933 --> 14:45.558
It's like you put him in a big diaper,

14:45.559 --> 14:47.600
and now he can shit
himself whenever he likes.

14:47.601 --> 14:49.641
- (CHUCKLES)
- Uh, he has all the shots

14:49.642 --> 14:51.224
but he doesn't know when to play them.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.434
- (LOGAN LAUGHS)
- I... I don't know. (CHUCKLING)

14:55.142 --> 14:56.725
Yikes.

14:56.726 --> 15:00.224
Look at them. Fucking
coochie-fucking-coo.

15:00.225 --> 15:02.766
Yeah, I haven't seen him
like this for a while.

15:02.767 --> 15:05.891
Yeah, not since Sally Anne
and the summer of the horses.

15:05.892 --> 15:08.099
- Remember that shit?
- Right.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.766
- ROMAN: Well...
- Do you think, um...

15:10.767 --> 15:12.600
like, do you think they're fucking?

15:12.601 --> 15:14.309
Oh my God, could you imagine?

15:15.726 --> 15:17.683
Like a rhino fucking a hummingbird.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.266
She'd have to go cowgirl, right?

15:19.267 --> 15:22.474
Otherwise, he'd just like
snap her like a candy cane.

15:22.475 --> 15:28.057
Dude, are you... like...
talking yourself hard right now?

15:28.058 --> 15:30.141
Boys! Come on through.

15:30.142 --> 15:34.099
ROMAN: Come through, I guess.
All right. Come through what?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.974
- So...
- ROMAN: Mm-hm?

15:35.975 --> 15:37.017
Shiv's memo.

15:39.109 --> 15:40.850
KENDALL: Okay, we're...
we're... we're what?

15:40.851 --> 15:44.516
We're putting the concept
of Siobhan on the table

15:44.517 --> 15:45.891
for general discussion?

15:45.892 --> 15:48.224
You're tearing apart my
sister's pious bullshit

15:48.225 --> 15:50.141
for your entertainment? I
had a dream like this once.

15:50.142 --> 15:52.266
It's just good to air some views.

15:52.267 --> 15:53.350
ROMAN: Mm.

15:54.017 --> 15:55.183
KENDALL: Okay.

15:57.642 --> 16:00.391
Yeah, I mean, I think
the... the twin quotes

16:00.392 --> 16:03.974
from Thomas Aquinas and
Amelia Earhart really...

16:03.975 --> 16:07.850
- (ALL LAUGH)
- ... kick us off with a bang.

16:07.851 --> 16:10.725
ROMAN: Wow, so many pictures.
All the smiling children,

16:10.726 --> 16:13.141
all the various hues, that...
that melted the heart

16:13.142 --> 16:15.766
- of even this hardened racist.
- (RHEA LAUGHS)

16:15.767 --> 16:19.308
I... I like the spacing.
Um... Luxurious.

16:19.309 --> 16:21.224
- It is.
- But the protein.

16:21.225 --> 16:24.725
Well, there's no shortage
of concepts, for sure.

16:24.726 --> 16:27.182
It's a rich gumbo of
ideas and buzz words.

16:27.183 --> 16:30.683
Look, we should be gentle.
It's easy to be overly critical

16:30.684 --> 16:32.516
of the workings of a major corporation

16:32.517 --> 16:34.182
when you have no experience running one.

16:34.183 --> 16:36.558
I... You can't blame her
for a lack of experience.

16:36.559 --> 16:38.725
Well, sure you can. Just
watch, you'll get the hang of it

16:38.726 --> 16:40.182
- soon enough.
- (RHEA LAUGHS)

16:40.183 --> 16:41.766
GREG HIRSCH: No, thanks.
But those are really good.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.974
Those are organic. I'll
grab him and see what's...

16:44.975 --> 16:46.374
Hey, Tom.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.891
- TOM: Hey, Greg! How ya doin'?
- Good, good. Yeah.

16:48.892 --> 16:50.266
- Hey, bud.
- Good, yeah. Just busy.

16:50.267 --> 16:52.141
Just, uh... Why are you, um...

16:52.142 --> 16:54.266
- Sure, what's going on?
- Um, I'm just have a few, uh,

16:54.267 --> 16:57.558
- a few pals over for dinner.
- Ooh, look at you, Fancy Dan.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.266
The Greg Man. (LAUGHS)
What are you talking about?

17:00.267 --> 17:02.516
- Hey.
- Welcome to the next wave.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.683
Just a talking shop for renewal.

17:04.684 --> 17:06.441
(MOCKING) "Just a
talking shop for renewal".

17:06.442 --> 17:08.266
- (TOM LAUGHS)
- (CHUCKLES FEEBLY)

17:08.267 --> 17:10.141
No, no, no. It's good.
It's good. We're good.

17:10.142 --> 17:11.932
Listen, I wanted to, um,

17:11.933 --> 17:14.141
I wanted to ask you. I
was in the area, actually,

17:14.142 --> 17:16.473
that's why I came round.
I wanted to ask you,

17:16.474 --> 17:20.932
uh, how was today with
the guys? The interview?

17:20.933 --> 17:22.058
Oh, yeah. Um...

17:22.767 --> 17:25.473
Uh, yeah. Okay, I...

17:25.474 --> 17:28.098
- Uh, a little bit jittery.
- Mm-hmm.

17:28.099 --> 17:29.516
Uh, a bit of a stress comedown.

17:29.517 --> 17:31.641
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- You know, I, uh, got a haircut.

17:31.642 --> 17:33.600
Even though I didn't
really need a haircut.

17:33.601 --> 17:34.974
- Right.
- I think I just wanted someone

17:34.975 --> 17:38.461
to touch my head, you know.
Soothing. And, um,

17:38.462 --> 17:40.233
- I guess I found it a little bit stressful...
- Uh-huh. Great. Great.

17:40.234 --> 17:42.224
So, here's my thing.
Greg, you know the papers?

17:42.225 --> 17:44.391
The copies? I want them.

17:44.392 --> 17:46.016
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

17:46.017 --> 17:48.141
I did my part of the
deal. You got the office,

17:48.142 --> 17:50.182
a pretty little Gustav
Klimt poster up there,

17:50.183 --> 17:52.641
and now it's time for me
to <i>habeas the corpus.</i>

17:52.642 --> 17:56.141
GREG: No, right, right. I...
I... I mean, I just guess, uh...

17:56.142 --> 17:59.016
I... I just guess that they're,
like, my insurance policy.

17:59.017 --> 18:01.016
Yeah, but you don't
need an insurance policy.

18:01.017 --> 18:02.808
Well, in case things were to turn nasty.

18:02.809 --> 18:04.141
They're not gonna turn nasty.

18:04.142 --> 18:06.974
Okay? No one's gonna
break your legs, y'know?

18:06.975 --> 18:08.641
Okay, well that feels a bit nasty.

18:08.642 --> 18:11.808
But it's the insurance which
is causing the nastiness.

18:11.809 --> 18:15.850
If you were uninsured, you'd
be a lot safer. Ironically.

18:15.851 --> 18:17.658
Okay, well, they're not actually here,

18:17.659 --> 18:19.974
- so I don't really know what to tell you.
- Okay. Greg. Greg, Greg. Look.

18:19.975 --> 18:24.766
Okay, you played your
hand very well. I like it.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.516
- (CHUCKLES)
- I do.

18:26.517 --> 18:28.558
But we need to end this now.

18:28.559 --> 18:32.975
Or I tell Logan that you took
copies of sensitive documents.

18:33.642 --> 18:35.142
O... Okay, that...

18:37.933 --> 18:39.182
Well, I don't...

18:39.183 --> 18:41.433
Okay, well, I... I keep them at...

18:41.434 --> 18:43.182
I keep them at the office.

18:43.183 --> 18:44.725
You keep them at the office?

18:44.726 --> 18:46.266
Yeah. 'Cause they're work.

18:46.267 --> 18:47.850
I'll go... I'll go in early,

18:47.851 --> 18:49.516
and I'll give them to
you first thing tomorrow.

18:49.517 --> 18:51.477
Right. Right. (SNAPS
FINGERS) But... But... But...

18:53.100 --> 18:55.016
Except I can't trust you.

18:55.017 --> 18:56.725
- (SIGHS)
- Okay, it's not personal.

18:56.726 --> 18:59.224
I just can't trust you.
So, in a friendly way,

18:59.225 --> 19:00.809
I'm staying here tonight,

19:02.350 --> 19:04.016
and I'm gonna travel
in with you tomorrow,

19:04.017 --> 19:06.057
and I'm gonna go with you to
wherever you have the papers,

19:06.058 --> 19:07.641
- and then later, together...
- Dude.

19:07.642 --> 19:10.016
... we're gonna dispose
of them off-premises.

19:10.017 --> 19:13.891
And if you squeal or
you try to take copies,

19:13.892 --> 19:16.559
- I'll break your legs.
- (CHUCKLES)

19:19.309 --> 19:23.392
Sorry, I hope you didn't mind
eating in. But it's just...

gone to the pub apparently,

Yeah, but he loves it, doesn't he?
