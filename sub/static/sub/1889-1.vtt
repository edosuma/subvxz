01:18.189 --> 01:19.745
Where is he?

01:36.609 --> 01:39.543
Next diver, Zheng Jun, 5225B

01:40.095 --> 01:45.890
Zheng Jun! Zheng Jun! Zheng Jun!

01:59.631 --> 02:00.989
- Zheng Jun!
-What's going on?

02:01.049 --> 02:02.924
- Zheng Jun! 
- Jheng Jun!

02:14.412 --> 02:16.030
The third victim in the mysterious "smile murders"

02:15.530 --> 02:18.190
Turned up today.

02:18.344 --> 02:20.618
The deceased is diving star Zheng Jun.

02:21.118 --> 02:22.082
Eyewitness accounts state

02:21.582 --> 02:24.753
he died suddenly in mid-air, during a dive.

02:24.253 --> 02:26.218
The cause of death is unknown.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.362
Later that night crowds of Zheng Jun's fans

02:28.862 --> 02:30.864
gathered to mourn his death.

02:30.922 --> 02:33.099
While expressing their grief,

02:32.599 --> 02:34.105
mourners also called for answers from the police,

02:33.605 --> 02:35.793
demanding to know

02:35.293 --> 02:37.887
what measures are being taken to solve the case.

02:37.387 --> 02:40.438
With pressure on the police mounting from mourners

02:39.938 --> 02:42.344
and bereaved family members,

02:41.844 --> 02:45.373
Police Commissioner Ma stated in an interview yesterday

02:45.528 --> 02:48.280
that she would soon be making a public statement.

02:47.780 --> 02:50.115
Next is entertainment news.

03:41.012 --> 03:47.265
BADGES OF FURY

03:57.876 --> 04:00.378
- I'm a cop. 
- Excuse me, two wiskeys,

04:01.452 --> 04:03.100
I'm a cop...

04:03.316 --> 04:04.977
- I'm a cop... 
- Knock it off!

04:04.835 --> 04:07.825
the whole world will know you're a cop!

04:08.706 --> 04:09.924
Madam,

04:10.610 --> 04:14.409
you said this was a Scottish theme party...

04:15.590 --> 04:16.870
That's right...

04:18.021 --> 04:21.041
Are you sure this isn't a Scottish crossdressing party?

04:20.914 --> 04:22.405
Who said that?

04:22.185 --> 04:24.924
I got that kilt on vacation in Scotland two years ago.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.185
For myself.

04:31.049 --> 04:32.225
What?

04:32.671 --> 04:34.121
Ooooh! Bomb!

04:34.341 --> 04:35.978
What? Huang Fei Hong, what did you say?

04:35.743 --> 04:36.941
Four 2's!

04:37.394 --> 04:38.980
Where are you?

04:42.179 --> 04:44.362
Hello! What are you staring at?

04:44.067 --> 04:46.038
Show him the royal flush!

04:46.456 --> 04:49.764
Hello! This chef's got beated so hard!

04:49.604 --> 04:51.255
The exchanged is in the dance hall,

04:50.911 --> 04:52.360
Why are you in the back kitchen?

04:52.054 --> 04:53.705
I'm obviously

04:53.219 --> 04:54.464
laying in ambush

04:54.075 --> 04:55.421
The minute they see a problem,

04:55.060 --> 04:57.113
they'll try to leave through the kitchen.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.788
I say show him the royal flush!

04:58.392 --> 05:00.576
Four 2's came out, now the ace is the highest.

05:00.202 --> 05:02.052
Just show him the royal flush!

05:07.639 --> 05:10.436
That, right here, is a man who understands fashion!

05:10.290 --> 05:14.819
It's not every man who can put on a dress and pull it off!

05:16.268 --> 05:19.022
And look at you, taking a designer skirt,

05:18.803 --> 05:21.352
and murdering it.

05:21.161 --> 05:23.827
How are you any different from a murderer?

05:23.602 --> 05:25.019
A murderer!

05:25.190 --> 05:27.206
You're making fun of me?

05:27.015 --> 05:28.289
Yeah!

05:28.547 --> 05:30.503
Laughing at me?

05:30.795 --> 05:32.282
Wang Bu Er, calm down!

05:31.742 --> 05:33.104
Mocking at me?

05:32.762 --> 05:36.200
He just means he's enjoying the spectacle of you, is all!

05:35.964 --> 05:37.889
Not everyone understands fashion.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.313
Respect the man's trade.

05:38.993 --> 05:40.421
He's so rude!

05:40.634 --> 05:41.876
Madam,

05:41.527 --> 05:43.790
if I believed that, my name wouldn't be Wang Bu Er!

05:43.438 --> 05:44.785
my name wouldn't be Wang Bu Er!

05:44.427 --> 05:46.664
That's right, your name wouldn't be Bu Er,

05:46.302 --> 05:48.094
because that's not a stupid name at all!

05:49.474 --> 05:51.388
Madam, let's switch channels.

05:54.559 --> 05:55.930
What's the matter?

05:56.091 --> 05:58.248
Madam, I have to ask you something.

05:59.064 --> 06:02.537
Why did you make Huang my Partner?

06:02.287 --> 06:04.034
Is that a problem?

06:03.839 --> 06:05.548
I just want to know why.

06:05.609 --> 06:07.522
Because you're too impulsive!

06:07.558 --> 06:11.075
Hang is a grizzled old cop who survives.

06:10.884 --> 06:13.596
I figured if anybody could neutralize you, it's him.

06:13.328 --> 06:16.606
Umm... I don't want to interrupt,

06:16.822 --> 06:18.500
but I'm not a grizzled old cop.

06:18.397 --> 06:19.926
I'm a nicely-aged veteran.

06:20.592 --> 06:21.873
Channel 3.

06:23.270 --> 06:24.780
Look,

06:24.519 --> 06:26.220
with a cop like Huang,

06:25.949 --> 06:28.998
he can't make it as a pop idol, he can't act,

06:28.744 --> 06:31.665
he talks too much, and he's trouble. How did he make it on the force?

06:31.401 --> 06:34.267
He might be old, and obnoxious,

06:33.925 --> 06:36.363
and talk too much,

06:36.006 --> 06:39.238
But he solved a lot of big cases when he was young.

06:39.250 --> 06:43.245
He's made it this far beacuse he's good at his job.

06:43.262 --> 06:44.701
Thank you, Madam!

06:45.026 --> 06:46.637
How are you still listening?

06:46.297 --> 06:47.962
Hello? Hello? You think I want to listen?

06:47.684 --> 06:49.671
With the way you're changing frequencies,

06:49.325 --> 06:52.573
if I can still hear you, it's a good bet the suspects can hear you, too.

06:53.433 --> 06:54.759
It's been a long time!

06:54.436 --> 06:56.514
- Yes it has, did you miss me?
- I missed your goods.

06:56.214 --> 06:57.732
Whatever you missed, I have!

06:58.437 --> 07:01.332
Team A reports a visual on target!

07:02.743 --> 07:04.033
Everyone get ready!

07:03.747 --> 07:04.523
Stay on alert.

07:04.141 --> 07:05.893
Remember, we don't move

07:05.514 --> 07:07.410
until both the money and the merchandise change hands.

07:07.512 --> 07:09.570
A Scottish jig!

07:18.509 --> 07:19.831
The money?

07:21.632 --> 07:22.812
The goods?

07:24.147 --> 07:26.386
Quit it! Hurry up! Hurry!

07:26.104 --> 07:27.581
Alright, money!

07:29.051 --> 07:30.368
Get colser...

07:31.546 --> 07:32.672
Boss.

07:33.352 --> 07:34.970
These guys don't waste time!

07:34.703 --> 07:36.506
Money and merch are on the table!

07:36.552 --> 07:38.429
Wang Bu Er, get back to position!

07:40.066 --> 07:43.147
Wait until they exchanged the meney and the merchandise!

07:43.064 --> 07:45.762
Before that, don't them get suspicious!

08:00.634 --> 08:02.111
Chen Hu!

08:01.791 --> 08:03.365
Chen Hu? What's a Chen Hu?

08:03.278 --> 08:06.025
Chen Hu, the crime boss who disappeared 7 years ago!

08:05.747 --> 08:07.109
Where?

08:06.904 --> 08:08.211
Short hair,

08:08.429 --> 08:09.837
black trenchcoat,

08:09.970 --> 08:11.831
heading in my direction.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.900
It is Chen Hu! It's Chen Hu!

08:13.601 --> 08:15.257
No away,

08:14.997 --> 08:16.679
just when we're about to wrap up,

08:16.498 --> 08:18.201
we get a Chen Hu!

08:17.947 --> 08:20.681
Wang Bu Er, get back to position!

08:20.496 --> 08:22.284
Tonight the target is Guo Xiao Bao!

08:22.016 --> 08:24.402
I'll send Team C to pick up Chen Hu.

08:24.173 --> 08:25.565
This can't wait anymore.

08:26.384 --> 08:28.918
Chen Hu is a dangerous criminal.

08:28.799 --> 08:31.450
Special cases like him deserve special task forces.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.994
We've already waited 7 years!

08:32.702 --> 08:34.068
We can't wait any more!

08:33.759 --> 08:35.926
What are you worried about? We've waited 7 years,

08:35.745 --> 08:37.462
we can wait a little longer.

08:37.138 --> 08:38.955
How much longer?

08:38.982 --> 08:40.424
Until I retire.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.034
Wait...

08:45.797 --> 08:48.504
- Now, it's time for tonight's prize drawing, 
- What happened?

08:48.225 --> 08:51.239
"Fate's Lucky Choice"! Let's get started!

08:51.947 --> 08:53.506
I'd like everyon's attention,

08:53.210 --> 08:55.590
because tonight's lucky winner is...

08:56.165 --> 08:58.153
is...

09:00.118 --> 09:02.116
...This gentleman!

09:02.224 --> 09:03.524
Police!

09:04.141 --> 09:07.673
I wasn't laughing at you! I swear...

09:08.047 --> 09:09.626
Long time no see!

09:09.515 --> 09:10.924
That's quite a short skirt!

09:38.383 --> 09:39.613
Madam...

09:40.108 --> 09:41.800
What are you hearing?

09:41.540 --> 09:43.420
I'm listening to the sound of my career

09:43.706 --> 09:46.349
going up in smokes.

09:46.265 --> 09:48.180
Madam, "smoke" is uncountable.

10:45.292 --> 10:47.101
Hanung Fei Hong, Hunag Fei Hong,

10:47.035 --> 10:48.629
go hlep Wang Bu Er!

10:48.372 --> 10:49.553
Hung Fei Hong?

10:49.683 --> 10:50.904
Hung Fei Hong?

10:52.556 --> 10:53.862
Hung Fei Hong?

10:54.545 --> 10:56.288
Ahhh!

12:05.430 --> 12:07.497
Who exactly are you?

12:07.596 --> 12:09.818
Oh, right, forget to introduce myselft...

12:09.786 --> 12:10.701
Police!

13:08.656 --> 13:10.054
Chen Hu!

13:10.073 --> 13:12.259
The long arm of the law always gets its man!

13:13.434 --> 13:14.684
Nice line.

13:21.229 --> 13:23.371
You're a nexus for the universe's incompetence.

13:29.736 --> 13:31.854
It was a simple case.

13:31.634 --> 13:33.486
Both suspects escaped,

13:33.330 --> 13:35.261
we lost the goods and the evidence,

13:35.014 --> 13:37.392
and Chen Hu, one of our most wanted men, also got away!

13:38.391 --> 13:40.979
So what happened, exactly?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.894
Do you want me to get so mad that I bite down on my gun?

13:44.336 --> 13:45.701
Madam!

13:45.444 --> 13:47.501
We weren't expecting Chen Hu.

13:47.345 --> 13:49.345
I've already taken temporary measures

13:49.060 --> 13:50.388
to minimize the damage.

13:50.517 --> 13:52.936
You pulverized the bar, that's your minimized damage?

13:53.358 --> 13:55.718
All that proves is that you don't know what you're doing!

13:55.572 --> 13:56.762
You idiots!

13:56.567 --> 13:57.929
You morons!

13:57.727 --> 13:59.211
Your wastes of air!

13:59.697 --> 14:01.041
Thank you, Madam!

14:03.348 --> 14:04.777
For what?

14:06.995 --> 14:08.750
I'm thinking exactly what you are.

14:08.855 --> 14:10.606
I always tell them...

14:10.561 --> 14:12.884
I always say, the chief is smart,

14:12.679 --> 14:13.868
listen to her!

14:14.177 --> 14:16.018
Cut the Bullshit!

14:16.058 --> 14:18.591
I have 18 people lying in the hospital

14:18.493 --> 14:20.899
and a million-dollar bill from the bar.

14:20.921 --> 14:23.738
Who's plying for this? Who's taking responsibillity?

14:23.480 --> 14:24.565
Me!

14:25.583 --> 14:27.055
This wasn't their fault.

14:26.910 --> 14:29.038
If you see fit to consign me to a desk, i'll take it!

14:29.694 --> 14:30.919
Fine!

14:31.055 --> 14:33.016
Starting tomorrow, you're my secretary!

14:34.650 --> 14:36.170
I know nothing about computers.

14:35.926 --> 14:37.252
You theree

14:37.876 --> 14:40.655
are going to write me a very detailed report,

14:40.511 --> 14:41.693
and if I don't like it,

14:41.489 --> 14:42.962
you guard the parking garage from now on!

14:43.018 --> 14:44.191
Yes, Madam...

14:45.153 --> 14:47.335
The workday is over,

14:47.074 --> 14:48.482
we'll write it tomorrow.

14:54.757 --> 14:57.222
Do you know why I'm still a police officer?

14:56.975 --> 14:59.274
I have a master's degree in criminal investigation,

14:59.003 --> 15:00.806
and another in criminal psychology.

15:00.730 --> 15:01.977
When I was a detective,

15:01.664 --> 15:03.354
I solved two major cases and won three awards for excellence.

15:02.996 --> 15:03.978
But with all that, I still haven't been promoted.

15:03.637 --> 15:04.965
Do you know why?

15:04.645 --> 15:07.022
Because you're stupid.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.995
I'm stupid?

15:08.664 --> 15:10.340
You are the source of my stupidity!

15:10.016 --> 15:11.028
Me?

15:10.735 --> 15:12.410
If it weren't for you, I'd be commissioner already!

15:12.089 --> 15:14.178
Do you think you'd have any success if it weren't for me?

15:13.872 --> 15:15.657
Do you remember the Causeway Bay vice roundup,

15:15.654 --> 15:16.843
and the thief I caught in Sham Shui Po two years ago?

15:16.540 --> 15:17.802
How could I forget?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.941
We didn't catch a single thief or a single prostitute.

15:18.798 --> 15:21.030
But on the same raid, I found a counterfeiting ring,

15:20.796 --> 15:22.702
and caught a serial killer in a brothel.

15:22.410 --> 15:23.480
Don't you get it?

15:23.223 --> 15:24.764
Where would you be if it weren't for me?

15:24.204 --> 15:25.408
Now get on your knees and thank me!

15:25.136 --> 15:26.710
Me, kneel and thank you?

15:26.432 --> 15:28.592
If the day actually comes when you help me solve cases,

15:28.003 --> 15:29.195
I'll build a shrine

15:28.845 --> 15:30.937
- and burn incense with you. 
- But not to me?

15:30.756 --> 15:32.207
If not to me, then to who?

15:31.873 --> 15:33.760
Your tombstone!

15:33.788 --> 15:34.932
Again with the fighting?

15:34.762 --> 15:36.156
Just get married.

15:36.031 --> 15:37.711
We fight, so we should get married?

15:37.516 --> 15:39.120
By the logic, I should marry you!

15:38.824 --> 15:40.023
If you married me,

15:39.700 --> 15:42.228
I'd naver come home and you're die pining for me!

15:41.935 --> 15:43.550
Do you actually think I'd marry you?

15:43.251 --> 15:45.116
I'd be scared you couldn't handle the loneliness.

15:44.851 --> 15:46.463
Touch me if you want get hurt!

15:46.170 --> 15:48.203
- Dare you hurt me! 
- Stop stop, let go!

15:47.812 --> 15:49.718
- Hey, stop! 
- Yeah, I will marry you!

15:49.405 --> 15:50.771
Let's go, go get married!

15:50.514 --> 15:51.674
Go! Get moving!

15:51.354 --> 15:53.056
Who caught the suspect last night?

16:01.325 --> 16:02.821
You're a hero, sir!

16:03.951 --> 16:06.090
These are top-secret files.

16:07.547 --> 16:09.038
This is the head of an internet film piracy group

16:08.770 --> 16:11.996
that we interpol have been chasing for five years!

16:12.063 --> 16:13.199
Bi Touren.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.665
BitTorrent?

16:17.356 --> 16:18.596
In those years,

16:19.192 --> 16:21.609
he uploaded illegal copies of movies,

16:21.867 --> 16:23.678
includeing "Love is Not Blind"...

16:23.759 --> 16:24.922
Have you seen it?

16:25.083 --> 16:26.574
He didn't know what he was doing.

16:27.017 --> 16:28.193
Go easy on him.

16:27.896 --> 16:30.862
Lately he's been focusing on domestic kung fu movies,

16:30.752 --> 16:31.951
like "Fearless",

16:32.028 --> 16:33.419
"The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"...

16:34.019 --> 16:35.667
Hey, you look kind of familiar.

16:36.340 --> 16:37.870
Piracy is theft!

16:38.250 --> 16:39.499
Monsters like that should be shot!

16:42.350 --> 16:45.860
Actually I was the one who caught him.

16:45.642 --> 16:48.074
Actually, I planned the whole operation.

16:47.810 --> 16:49.288
I was in command.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.303
Congratulations.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.196
Just doing my job.

16:53.370 --> 16:54.921
Wait a second.

16:55.632 --> 16:58.196
may I have your attention, please!

17:00.805 --> 17:02.115
Don't worry,

17:02.018 --> 17:03.944
I was just taking a picture to remember this by.

17:03.728 --> 17:05.858
Say cheese!

17:16.071 --> 17:18.415
Babe, finally, you picked up the phone.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.855
Listen, don't get mad, don't get mad.

17:18.755 --> 17:20.104
Just let me explain, okay?

17:21.108 --> 17:23.339
All want is one more chance, okay?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.037
Oh shut up!

17:51.168 --> 17:52.526
Detective Wang!

17:55.284 --> 17:58.364
The deceased was Wang Feng, male, 32,

17:58.232 --> 17:59.821
a real estate project manager

17:59.693 --> 18:01.460
He was unmarried, had diabetes,

18:01.342 --> 18:02.655
and was a member of Greenpeace,

18:02.450 --> 18:04.079
an environmentalist.

18:15.102 --> 18:16.505
Miu Miu?

18:21.479 --> 18:23.252
Orange juice...

18:26.754 --> 18:28.459
This is a murder.

18:28.197 --> 18:31.275
And I think, the murderer is a jilted, and perverted, lover

18:31.236 --> 18:34.648
who drinks orange juice, and wears fake Miu Miu heels,

18:43.081 --> 18:44.690
Why did it have to be you?

18:46.108 --> 18:48.430
It's a cruel god

18:49.217 --> 18:51.057
that makes me bring you in myself.

18:50.883 --> 18:52.662
I know how the story began,

18:52.527 --> 18:54.497
but I naver guessed it would come to this.

18:54.187 --> 18:56.266
I don't want our relationship to end like this either,

18:56.569 --> 18:58.434
but I'm a police officer,

18:59.525 --> 19:01.115
and this is my duty.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.094
Yeah, yeah, you're a cop,

19:03.220 --> 19:05.331
You think this is "infemal Affairs"?

19:05.098 --> 19:07.089
Can you maybe use your brain?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.840
Are bad guys that easy to catch?

19:09.206 --> 19:12.171
I just spilled the drink a minute ago,

19:11.934 --> 19:15.006
and I bought these shoes in Europe,

19:14.853 --> 19:16.496
and they're genuine.

19:23.030 --> 19:26.253
You, take those stupid glasses off.

19:25.953 --> 19:28.226
You're here to gather evidence, not pretend you're cool.

19:33.712 --> 19:35.981
Hey, help us out, alright?

19:36.494 --> 19:38.961
Bring it over here. Okay, turn it.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.536
By my observatins, I deduce this is a murder case.

19:42.777 --> 19:45.676
By your observations, even I should be in jail.

19:45.471 --> 19:46.797
Where's your evidence?

19:47.342 --> 19:50.250
Who would commit suicide by drowning themselves in cement?

19:51.721 --> 19:54.167
Get him back to the station.

19:54.467 --> 19:57.513
Madam, the piece of cement is too big.

19:57.292 --> 19:59.079
He won't fit in the van.

19:58.808 --> 20:00.806
So get a bigger vehicle.

20:00.883 --> 20:03.623
If we call now, they won't be here for another hour.

20:03.449 --> 20:04.791
Then wait.

20:04.509 --> 20:07.214
There might be important evidence in his phone.

20:07.143 --> 20:08.666
Don't break it.

20:14.266 --> 20:15.782
If you want something done, do it now.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.488
Waiting is for the helpless.

20:17.255 --> 20:18.602
Go examine this cell phone.

20:25.026 --> 20:26.755
Wang Bu Er!

20:31.889 --> 20:33.388
How is the autopsy on this body coming?

20:33.103 --> 20:34.429
We've been sitting on our butts too long,

20:34.098 --> 20:35.339
We need a case we can solve!

20:35.572 --> 20:36.943
I don't know.

20:36.607 --> 20:38.605
I'm the janitor.

20:40.996 --> 20:42.764
How is the autopsy on this body coming?

20:42.433 --> 20:43.768
We've been siting on our butts too long,

20:43.413 --> 20:44.659
we need a case we can solve!

20:45.496 --> 20:46.912
I've done tests,

20:46.690 --> 20:48.518
but I can't find an obvious reason for death.

20:48.557 --> 20:51.009
I don't think this is a suicide, though.

20:51.107 --> 20:52.284
Why?

20:52.065 --> 20:53.849
Because of how he looks,

20:54.578 --> 20:56.017
What about it?

20:56.275 --> 20:57.647
He's smiling.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.959
Do you remember the "smile murders" case?

20:59.657 --> 21:00.599
Sure.

21:00.373 --> 21:02.952
The only similarity was the smile on their faces.

21:02.580 --> 21:05.025
So I think it's the same killer,

21:04.736 --> 21:07.038
a serial killer.

21:06.714 --> 21:08.760
A serial killer!

21:08.441 --> 21:09.817
And, I've discovered

21:09.473 --> 21:11.363
the same woman present

21:11.069 --> 21:13.418
at each of the victims funerals.

21:13.151 --> 21:14.861
She wore that?

21:14.527 --> 21:16.906
Criminal psycohology

21:16.826 --> 21:19.470
says murderers go to the funerals of their victims

21:19.177 --> 21:21.996
to relive the thrill of the murder.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.861
Wow, that's sick!

21:23.593 --> 21:25.394
And if he said pigs could climb trees,

21:25.280 --> 21:27.426
You'd believe that, too.

21:27.802 --> 21:30.153
They're climbing now! Go look!

21:29.906 --> 21:32.209
The woman's name is Liu Ji¤Ñ...

21:33.028 --> 21:35.188
Liu Jin Shui.

21:34.915 --> 21:38.358
She's the ex-girlfriend of every dead body here.

21:39.094 --> 21:40.803
Crimes of passion.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.043
I think that's a good analysis,

21:41.757 --> 21:43.576
Really? You think so too?

21:43.276 --> 21:45.383
Right, it just hit its five day average again.

21:45.265 --> 21:48.893
If you ask me, in the next three days, this stock is definitely going up.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.861
Hey, keep personal calls on personal time.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.523
Okay, that's it for now.

21:54.227 --> 21:58.405
Wang Bu Er, the motive here is obvious.

21:58.528 --> 22:01.210
We cant's afford any more delays.

22:01.055 --> 22:03.894
We need the murder suspect apprehended!

22:07.121 --> 22:08.457
Where's Bu Er?

22:08.963 --> 22:10.968
You're his boss,

22:10.683 --> 22:12.598
and I'm not his nanny.

23:00.787 --> 23:03.665
We face many challenges in our society.

23:04.017 --> 23:07.274
With a unified will, we can face

23:07.301 --> 23:09.783
and overcome these obstacles.

23:09.655 --> 23:11.389
We can bridge the divisions that separate us.

23:11.062 --> 23:12.262
Look out!

23:33.652 --> 23:34.803
Cut!

23:35.323 --> 23:36.713
Cut! Cut!

23:40.094 --> 23:41.279
Hold on, hold on...

23:41.300 --> 23:42.493
Get that shot! Get that shot!

23:42.581 --> 23:43.929
Get that shot! Get that shot!

23:43.666 --> 23:45.736
That was beautiful.

23:45.764 --> 23:48.214
- We got that scene just now, right? 
- Yeah.

23:48.396 --> 23:49.471
That scene

23:49.158 --> 23:52.562
was probably the best work I've ever done as a director.

23:52.294 --> 23:53.600
it Just came together, perfectly.

23:53.239 --> 23:56.617
With your directorial talent, you make it look easy.

23:56.294 --> 23:57.721
Of course.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.623
Who are you?

23:58.067 --> 23:59.752
The police!

24:00.168 --> 24:01.354
The police?

24:01.059 --> 24:02.773
Why did you kill your boyfriends?

24:02.484 --> 24:03.772
What are you saying?

24:03.463 --> 24:05.322
You have the right to remain silent.

24:04.992 --> 24:06.472
Everything you say

24:06.114 --> 24:07.692
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

24:08.293 --> 24:10.753
Our lead actress is a murderer?

24:10.604 --> 24:13.678
Oh, we can sell that! We can... sell that.

24:20.048 --> 24:24.255
Let's do good cop bad cop.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.928
You be the bad cop.

24:25.671 --> 24:27.310
You get to be the good cop?

24:27.422 --> 24:29.627
And I'm the bad cop. Why?

24:29.353 --> 24:31.570
Anyone could see

24:31.236 --> 24:33.451
I'm a more convincing good cop.

24:34.417 --> 24:36.457
If you were playing an idiot, you'd get an Oscar.

24:42.911 --> 24:44.619
What?

24:47.463 --> 24:49.030
When we go in there,

24:48.720 --> 24:52.900
let's do the good cop bad cop routine.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.843
You play the bad cop.

24:54.725 --> 24:57.760
I'm the bad cop? Why do I have to be the bad cop.

24:57.485 --> 25:00.777
I'm a more convincing good cop.

25:00.527 --> 25:01.883
So what are you saying I look like?

25:01.522 --> 25:04.237
I'm not saying you look like anything.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.896
I'm just saying, comparatively,

25:06.038 --> 25:08.015
I seem nicer.

25:07.661 --> 25:09.107
But I'm a better actress.

25:08.728 --> 25:11.003
That's exactly right.

25:10.641 --> 25:13.774
I'm a terrible actor,

25:13.402 --> 25:15.604
so I can only play myself.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.462
You know, that's kind of true.

25:17.425 --> 25:18.763
You have to be really nasty.

25:18.402 --> 25:19.135
Really nasty?

25:18.635 --> 25:19.705
Swear at her.

25:19.205 --> 25:20.144
Swear at her...

25:20.063 --> 25:21.170
Then beat her up.

25:21.051 --> 25:22.920
Beat her up? That's no good.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.236
I don't mean really hit her,

25:24.112 --> 25:26.891
I mean, make it like you're about to, then I'll restrain you.

25:27.081 --> 25:28.296
and then I'll hit you.

25:27.948 --> 25:30.059
Why are you going to hit me?

25:30.155 --> 25:33.005
I'm the good cop, you're the bad cop, right?

25:32.727 --> 25:35.804
I don't agree with you hitting her.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.531
Am I right?

25:36.201 --> 25:38.989
- This is crazy! 
- Fine...

25:45.455 --> 25:48.697
Miss Liu, you're even more beautiful in person than the movies.

25:48.532 --> 25:51.087
You killed them, right? Confess.

25:50.803 --> 25:51.866
It wasn't me.

25:52.113 --> 25:54.217
I don't know why they died.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.241
It's a shame this isn't a movie,

25:58.576 --> 26:00.346
because you're a good actress.

26:01.591 --> 26:05.605
You don't know why they died, so you're blaming me.

26:05.756 --> 26:07.379
Incompetent!

26:16.120 --> 26:18.375
Hey! Hey! Hey!

26:18.919 --> 26:21.043
Don't be nervous... Don't be nervous...

26:22.507 --> 26:24.313
Don't be nervous... Don't be nervous...

26:24.094 --> 26:25.524
What are you doing?

26:25.395 --> 26:26.417
What are you doing?

26:26.235 --> 26:28.388
You said I'm incompetent? Hey! Hey! Hey!

26:28.103 --> 26:31.273
What are you doing? Calm down! Calm down! Let me go!

26:30.939 --> 26:33.921
She can't handle a punch from you!

26:33.780 --> 26:37.601
Calm down... Calm down... Sit down, sit down...

26:37.591 --> 26:39.499
Calm down... Calm down...

26:40.193 --> 26:42.227
Miss Liu, don't be frightened,

26:41.935 --> 26:43.874
we're just doing our jobs.

26:47.011 --> 26:48.282
Please continue.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.588
I didn't do it, there's nothing to admit.

26:52.847 --> 26:55.048
Why don't you tell me

26:54.903 --> 26:57.059
why I would kill them?

26:58.397 --> 27:01.890
Well, and this is just my presonal opinion,

27:02.222 --> 27:05.183
after your four ex-boyfriends dumped you

27:04.957 --> 27:06.590
like a bag of old pantyhose,

27:06.803 --> 27:08.753
You didn't feel like it was fair,

27:08.461 --> 27:10.249
so you killed them.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.109
A woman at your age,

27:14.292 --> 27:16.945
with no boyfriend, no one to pay attention to you,

27:16.790 --> 27:19.314
no one to spoil you, no one to love you...

27:19.252 --> 27:20.481
Every day, you wake up and go to work,

27:20.193 --> 27:23.458
and you see the street full of couples,

27:23.247 --> 27:25.976
while you're alone,

27:26.155 --> 27:28.125
and it's sad, actually.

27:27.864 --> 27:29.737
When we take a woman like you,

27:29.574 --> 27:31.260
and toss you out alone into the cold, wide, world,

27:31.031 --> 27:33.402
you're a ticking time bomb.

27:33.365 --> 27:35.804
What are you talking about?

27:36.741 --> 27:37.929
Madam!

27:43.725 --> 27:45.356
You have a lot of reports to write.

27:45.306 --> 27:47.398
More reports?

27:48.116 --> 27:50.229
One about why you broke the trash can,

27:50.989 --> 27:53.419
one on why you arrested a suspect without evidence,

27:53.559 --> 27:55.554
oh, one on why a film company is filling suit against us,

27:55.816 --> 27:58.819
And if you don't let her go, you'll have another to write.

28:00.395 --> 28:04.174
Quit saying "you" all the time, We're all cops.

28:04.471 --> 28:06.875
You arrested her. I wasn't there.

28:07.448 --> 28:08.562
Let her go.

28:08.492 --> 28:10.251
Why should I?

28:10.691 --> 28:12.479
Commissioner's orders.

28:13.211 --> 28:15.769
Right, uh, Miss Liu,

28:15.504 --> 28:17.679
we're sorry for taking up your valuable time.

28:17.693 --> 28:19.328
If you'll just take a look at this

28:18.828 --> 28:21.485
and sign if there're no problem, you can go.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.847
Did the power go out?

29:22.610 --> 29:24.730
Every man here is staring at me,

29:25.020 --> 29:26.851
Why are you pretending not to?

29:26.845 --> 29:28.697
I'm not into girls.

29:30.214 --> 29:32.262
I think you're scared of your wife.

29:33.483 --> 29:36.356
You know why we have so many harassment cases?

29:36.451 --> 29:37.996
Do you see what she's wearing?

29:37.798 --> 29:41.019
Just because I show it doesn't mean you can touch it.

29:43.513 --> 29:45.187
Have you seen enough?

29:46.881 --> 29:48.627
Miss, who are you looking for?

29:52.546 --> 29:53.766
My little sister.

29:53.609 --> 29:55.151
Your little sister?

29:59.521 --> 30:02.980
My instincts tell me this big sister is a problem.

30:02.891 --> 30:04.953
Big sister? Who?

30:05.090 --> 30:06.759
Liu Jin Shui's big sister.

30:08.143 --> 30:10.443
My instincts tell me the workday is over.

30:19.021 --> 30:20.060
Gao Min...

30:22.788 --> 30:23.701
Jin Shui...

30:30.887 --> 30:32.549
Are you okay?

30:36.728 --> 30:37.946
Jin Shui...

30:42.861 --> 30:44.674
You've got some nerve,

30:44.389 --> 30:47.002
bringing my cousin's ex-boyfriend out to show off like this.

30:47.165 --> 30:49.460
Are you out to steal everything she has?

30:49.509 --> 30:50.572
Hey,

30:50.855 --> 30:52.272
leave it alone.

30:53.275 --> 30:57.531
Sometimes, things happen that nobody expects.

30:57.065 --> 31:00.381
And with love, sometimes you can't help it.

31:00.144 --> 31:01.911
sometimes two people are drawn to each other.

31:01.608 --> 31:04.274
The most important thing in life is happiness, isn't it?

31:04.149 --> 31:06.719
And you're her maternal cousin,

31:06.946 --> 31:09.117
you're not my direct relative, if I'm not mistaken?

31:09.589 --> 31:11.438
Are you hungry?

31:11.353 --> 31:13.634
Want me to make something to put in your tum-tum?

31:13.513 --> 31:14.988
Sis,

31:15.866 --> 31:17.474
I'm not in the mood for this.

31:17.652 --> 31:20.190
You and Gao Min go home, okay?

31:30.772 --> 31:34.121
Don't say I'm being crazy, she's jealous of you.

31:39.489 --> 31:41.655
Why should she be?

31:41.549 --> 31:43.247
She's my sister.

31:43.364 --> 31:46.844
if she wasn't jealous, why would steal your boyfriends?

31:46.899 --> 31:48.704
I don't know why,

31:48.807 --> 31:50.995
but she seems different lately.

31:59.845 --> 32:02.374
This is the victim's residence.

32:02.646 --> 32:04.727
Yes, of course it's the victim's residence.

32:04.404 --> 32:05.864
The search warrant?

32:05.814 --> 32:07.454
No warrant.

32:07.329 --> 32:08.857
if we show them the search warrant,

32:08.516 --> 32:10.365
the people in the house will have their guard up.

32:10.024 --> 32:12.197
It could influence what evidence we can gather.

32:12.048 --> 32:15.043
Alright, but if there's someone there, what do we do?

32:14.817 --> 32:19.493
I checked, he lived alone. Now no one's here.

32:19.703 --> 32:21.640
Then why aren't we using the search warrant?

32:22.934 --> 32:23.948
I forgot it.

32:23.586 --> 32:24.730
You forgot?

32:26.869 --> 32:29.475
Why in grace's name do I have to know you.

32:31.075 --> 32:34.278
Because you're blessed.

32:35.450 --> 32:36.927
Blessed?

33:01.045 --> 33:03.761
If you can't even handle this, I don't know how you became a sergeant!

33:03.667 --> 33:05.278
With my brain!

33:06.073 --> 33:07.370
I'll toss you up.

33:07.205 --> 33:08.403
Toss?

33:08.072 --> 33:09.362
Can you climb up?

33:15.674 --> 33:17.140
How much do you weigh?

33:18.426 --> 33:19.781
75 pounds...

33:22.609 --> 33:24.087
There you go!

33:39.198 --> 33:43.143
- You... You're trying to kill me! 
- As a police officer,

33:42.664 --> 33:45.093
you should know better than to provide false evidence!

33:44.805 --> 33:47.382
You're not 75 pounds!

33:50.015 --> 33:53.248
I've been eating a lot lately...

33:53.472 --> 33:55.013
I might be around 85 right now.

33:54.882 --> 33:56.038
How much?

33:57.153 --> 33:59.344
Okay, 120!

34:02.727 --> 34:03.670
Again!

34:03.963 --> 34:05.272
Again?

34:05.098 --> 34:06.324
Come on!

34:15.197 --> 34:16.934
150!

34:18.360 --> 34:20.425
I am not!

34:21.563 --> 34:23.965
There's... glass...!

34:27.980 --> 34:30.139
Wang Bu Er, I will kill you!

34:38.534 --> 34:40.161
There's someone here!

34:50.313 --> 34:51.878
Who are you?

34:52.886 --> 34:53.803
I...

35:04.343 --> 35:06.921
Hey, get me out of here first!

35:15.835 --> 35:17.940
Hey! Get me out!

35:31.461 --> 35:32.472
You...

37:41.634 --> 37:42.978
Me.

37:43.685 --> 37:47.833
If you'd said you were the insurance agent, I wouldn't have bad to beat you so bad!

37:48.952 --> 37:52.082
You... you didn't say were po...

37:51.967 --> 37:53.235
...lice.

37:55.010 --> 37:58.452
Hey, look at these.

37:59.637 --> 38:00.666
Look,

38:00.729 --> 38:03.759
our victim obviously had relationships

38:03.613 --> 38:06.072
with both of these women.

38:06.911 --> 38:09.906
And it's very possible

38:09.631 --> 38:11.909
that he wanted to marry one of them.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.792
It's suicide to ask two women

38:15.468 --> 38:17.314
to share one diamond.

38:17.047 --> 38:18.056
Good,

38:18.026 --> 38:22.264
then we don't need to...

38:21.976 --> 38:23.183
...pay compensation.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.844
When did the deceased buy insurance?

38:25.615 --> 38:29.708
Not... not more than a week ago.

38:29.358 --> 38:32.886
It became effective on the day he...

38:33.026 --> 38:34.526
...died.

38:36.596 --> 38:38.581
Who was the beneficiary?
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:40,021
I...

38:39.882 --> 38:41.266
What?

38:41.030 --> 38:43.810
I...

38:43.915 --> 38:46.125
I can't tell you...

38:51.667 --> 38:53.190
Sign it.

38:57.222 --> 38:58.861
You're the beneficiary?

38:58.876 --> 39:01.222
If you love me, sign it!

39:01.233 --> 39:02.817
It's called "Love's Guarantee".

39:02.759 --> 39:04.236
We have to break up.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.457
The truth is,

39:06.524 --> 39:07.987
I'm still in love with your sister.

39:09.294 --> 39:11.499
You men are all the same.

39:11.869 --> 39:13.902
Every time, you date my sister,

39:13.808 --> 39:15.561
then tell me you love me,

39:15.573 --> 39:17.627
until I start to get serious.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.806
then you all want to run back to her.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.383
And you're all shameless enough to propose to her!

39:22.422 --> 39:23.920
Listen.

39:23.676 --> 39:26.312
I migth dress a little sexier.

39:26.201 --> 39:28.376
but I keep my promise.

39:29.631 --> 39:31.916
I'm going to propose to your sister.

39:31.928 --> 39:33.222
Fine.

39:33.306 --> 39:35.021
If you don't love me,

39:35.274 --> 39:36.265
sing it.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.791
Sign it if I don't love you?

39:37.725 --> 39:39.728
"Love's Compensation."

39:48.294 --> 39:51.267
You won't be stealing your sister's boyfriends anymore.

39:51.905 --> 39:53.543
I'm the last one.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.668
We'll see.

40:14.193 --> 40:15.518
Hello, Uncle Liu.

40:16.470 --> 40:19.101
- He's asleep? 
- He is.

40:19.276 --> 40:21.169
Um, about your movie

40:21.374 --> 40:23.357
and what happened with it...

40:23.427 --> 40:25.331
sorry to hear about that.

40:26.318 --> 40:28.219
I don't know why...

40:28.487 --> 40:32.452
These last few years, nothing good has happened to me.

40:44.653 --> 40:50.020
The Eyes of Heaven - Fortune Teller

40:57.877 --> 41:00.025
I don't believe in this stuff. Forget it.

40:59.861 --> 41:01.418
We're here already,

41:01.164 --> 41:02.900
and I heard he's good.

41:02.613 --> 41:05.208
he has "the eyes of heaven", he can see everything.

41:08.505 --> 41:12.743
Did you see that? He knows we're here.

41:13.053 --> 41:15.642
Maybe that's why.

41:15.705 --> 41:17.372
Let's go in.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.626
Master, I never pictured you as such a stylish man!

41:33.507 --> 41:34.739
Fortune telling

41:34.554 --> 41:38.712
is actually just the scientific analysis of sufficient data.

41:38.793 --> 41:41.298
Miss, you're an actress

41:41.086 --> 41:42.382
and you're here to ask about your career?

41:42.050 --> 41:43.686
Tell us about her love life!

41:44.242 --> 41:45.748
We'll get to that.

41:46.110 --> 41:49.976
You were born in 1982, in the second lunar month?

41:50.154 --> 41:52.006
How did you know that?

41:51.707 --> 41:54.414
Because you filled that in when you made the appointment for her.

41:54.525 --> 41:57.521
Did you see I made the appointment six months ago?

41:57.348 --> 42:01.147
You've had significant difficulties in your career lately.

42:01.067 --> 42:03.618
You can't land a leading role.

42:03.302 --> 42:04.904
But how could you know that?

42:04.542 --> 42:06.280
Entertainment news.

42:05.929 --> 42:08.285
Some stupid cop went and wreaked havoc on your set,

42:07.941 --> 42:10.696
everyone knows that. Look.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.457
Eyes of Haven,

42:12.245 --> 42:15.088
could you tell us one of your own predictions?

42:15.649 --> 42:17.181
Of course.

42:26.396 --> 42:29.491
The whites of your eyes are full of red lines,

42:29.289 --> 42:31.615
What does that mean, Master?

42:32.128 --> 42:33.957
That means

42:33.909 --> 42:35.924
she may have stayed up all night,

42:35.681 --> 42:38.030
she's had too much alcohol, she just got done crying,

42:37.730 --> 42:39.432
or she has an eye infection.

42:39.102 --> 42:41.050
Enough, let's go.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.138
But!

42:42.793 --> 42:45.473
The blood vessels on the upper part of the whites of your eyes are straight and vertical!

42:45.136 --> 42:47.140
You're under a curse!

42:46.812 --> 42:48.345
Yeah right!

42:47.963 --> 42:50.934
The curse you're under is called the Star of Solitude,

42:50.615 --> 42:53.181
it means you'll always be alone!

42:52.810 --> 42:54.663
And...

42:54.299 --> 42:57.930
And only women can set this curse.

42:57.579 --> 42:58.845
Master,

42:59.225 --> 43:01.103
is there any way to remove it?

43:00.735 --> 43:02.195
Yes.

43:01.927 --> 43:04.055
Get the person cursing her

43:03.728 --> 43:05.408
to stop.

43:12.385 --> 43:14.727
Why did you bring me to Yi Yi's house?

43:14.501 --> 43:16.615
So you could find out the truth.

43:17.187 --> 43:20.387
Don't be stupid, alright? He was a fraud!

43:20.070 --> 43:22.734
If you don't go, I will.

43:22.672 --> 43:23.908
Wait!

43:36.353 --> 43:37.792
You?

43:37.833 --> 43:39.471
What you hungry now?

43:39.780 --> 43:42.424
Why did you put a curse on your sister?

43:42.515 --> 43:44.133
Yor're crazy!

43:45.128 --> 43:47.602
What is it that makes you want to hurt her?

43:48.104 --> 43:51.005
Come on, let's go! Quit causing problems for everyone!

43:50.884 --> 43:53.674
I'm asking you a question! Your sister is good to you,

43:53.375 --> 43:55.331
so why do you steal her boyfriends?

43:55.008 --> 43:57.469
I don't steal them,
³­ ¾È »¯¾ú¾î¿ä,

43:57.126 --> 43:59.792
they dumped her all by themselves!

44:00.887 --> 44:02.693
What did you say?

44:04.024 --> 44:05.755
I said,

44:05.564 --> 44:07.761
stop trying to be a movie star in real life.

44:07.919 --> 44:09.546
Sure,

44:09.341 --> 44:11.815
in the movies, all the men love you.

44:11.561 --> 44:15.039
In real life, your men love me.

44:15.367 --> 44:16.872
Now,

44:17.182 --> 44:21.477
is that my problem, or is that your problem?

44:31.165 --> 44:35.515
All these years you're never understood me.

44:35.764 --> 44:38.412
I don't want to be a star,

44:38.575 --> 44:41.001
I want to be a actress.

44:43.274 --> 44:45.830
She's already inside.

45:22.857 --> 45:25.702
Do you want me to come up and talk about it?

45:26.639 --> 45:29.457
No. I want to be alone!

45:47.095 --> 45:49.313
Give me one more chance!

45:49.199 --> 45:50.566
I know I was wrong,

45:50.268 --> 45:52.375
but once I was with her, I missed you every single day!

45:52.397 --> 45:54.176
I just... I got confused.

45:53.946 --> 45:56.002
Leave me alone!

45:55.986 --> 45:59.611
Jin Shui! Jin Shui! Jin Shui!

45:59.312 --> 46:00.537
I love you!

46:00.767 --> 46:02.438
Marry me!

46:06.073 --> 46:08.129
Are you serious?

46:30.161 --> 46:31.918
Even here, you can eat?

46:32.159 --> 46:34.200
I can't get off work on time,

46:33.902 --> 46:35.709
and now I can't eat on time?

46:35.378 --> 46:36.668
It's weird.

46:36.404 --> 46:39.904
Why do all the victims have that smile?

46:39.550 --> 46:42.212
Yeah, they all have that smile.

46:41.874 --> 46:43.848
Maybe something hit him in the acupressure point for laughter.

46:43.902 --> 46:45.708
You've been reading too many kung fu novels.

46:45.800 --> 46:48.066
Just because you don't know doesn't mean it's not real.

46:48.060 --> 46:52.006
Doctor, um, where is the laughter acupressure point?

46:52.280 --> 46:56.738
According to Western medicine, there's no such thing!

46:56.748 --> 46:58.507
You don't know where they are?

46:58.201 --> 47:00.311
On the bottom of your foot, and here.

47:02.511 --> 47:03.942
Just kidding, just kidding.

47:03.594 --> 47:05.561
If you believe that,

47:05.231 --> 47:08.080
then I know the Jax Arm Pull.

47:07.899 --> 47:10.279
If there really is an acupressure point for laughter,

47:09.949 --> 47:12.284
I'll serve you tea and give you massages,

47:11.979 --> 47:13.790
and I'll marry you...

47:19.735 --> 47:21.871
I'll go write the report, bye.

47:39.307 --> 47:41.098
Why is my picture up there?

47:41.063 --> 47:43.135
Anyone who has a relationship

47:42.870 --> 47:45.344
with the suspect goes up there,

47:45.222 --> 47:49.990
But here... there's a blank spot, and I didn't know who to put here.

47:51.717 --> 47:54.800
Anyone with a relationship?

47:54.533 --> 47:56.015
We have a realtionship.

47:55.688 --> 47:58.710
Shouldn't your picture be next to mine?

47:58.710 --> 48:01.235
What kind of a relationship are we supposed to have?

48:01.054 --> 48:04.017
I'm your superior,

48:03.920 --> 48:06.769
and I have better taste than that...

48:08.807 --> 48:12.181
We're partners! And of course we have a relationship as partners.

48:12.015 --> 48:12.804
Exactly.

48:12.524 --> 48:15.192
We work together, with one will and one heart.

48:14.692 --> 48:15.969
Right...

48:15.593 --> 48:18.140
And it raises our effectiveness as police.

48:17.830 --> 48:20.223
Yeah, alright, then raise it, increase it...

48:20.278 --> 48:22.476
Chief, I'd like to file a complaint.

48:22.174 --> 48:23.443
One of my co-workers

48:23.098 --> 48:26.538
- is trading stocks on company time. 
- Okay, that's all.

48:28.278 --> 48:30.408
Am i? Do you have proof?

48:30.091 --> 48:31.640
Well, then what were you doing?

48:31.372 --> 48:32.816
I'm raising my insurance coverage!

48:32.464 --> 48:33.647
Is there a difference?

48:33.265 --> 48:34.916
Yes, there is.

48:34.910 --> 48:37.166
If I didn't increase my coverage,

48:36.867 --> 48:39.355
the insurance company wouldn't tell me

48:39.003 --> 48:43.853
who the beneficiary of the victims insurance policies was.

48:46.150 --> 48:47.948
Who was it?

48:50.747 --> 48:56.416
Dai Yi Yi? She's the biggest suspect right now.

49:02.523 --> 49:04.115
Where's Wang Bu Er?

49:11.379 --> 49:14.134
Don't worry about the fine print,

49:13.866 --> 49:15.757
there's nothing in there to hurt you.

49:15.646 --> 49:18.634
All you have to do is

49:18.345 --> 49:20.863
initial Page 4, 8,

49:20.616 --> 49:23.097
12, 13, and 14.

49:23.711 --> 49:26.791
Okay, well, then... look, look! Everyone look!

49:26.537 --> 49:28.287
That's a lot of insurance!

49:28.186 --> 49:29.369
I'm looking, i'm looking...

49:29.014 --> 49:31.883
Uncle Lucky, making your men buy life insurance from me

49:31.601 --> 49:33.685
was very generous.

49:33.351 --> 49:36.507
No man has ever made me feel so secure.

49:36.298 --> 49:38.512
You bet.

49:38.261 --> 49:41.180
You know what they call Uncle Lucky?

49:40.937 --> 49:42.731
Tiger Crane Lucky!

49:43.943 --> 49:46.058
A tiger over here, a crane over there!

49:45.759 --> 49:47.564
One man, two animals!

49:46.889 --> 49:50.605
Brothers! Your life insurance today is on me!

49:51.369 --> 49:53.493
Alright! Good! Thank you. Uncle Lucky!

49:55.659 --> 49:57.891
Dai Yi Yi!

49:59.821 --> 50:02.244
What'll you have?

50:05.666 --> 50:07.725
Police!

50:10.172 --> 50:12.323
You... you're Dai Yi Yi?

50:12.055 --> 50:13.797
Yeah.

50:14.679 --> 50:20.540
Uncle Lucky, I'm scared. I don't know that man.

50:21.183 --> 50:22.451
Him?

50:24.230 --> 50:26.541
Don't warry, I'll handle him.

50:31.444 --> 50:33.313
Hey, what's the problem?

50:35.537 --> 50:37.619
I'm a cop, working a case.

50:39.742 --> 50:42.124
You ever heard of Tiger Crane Lucky?

50:42.041 --> 50:45.475
Go home if you know what's good for you.

50:45.382 --> 50:47.335
You can still walk out of here with your face intact!

50:52.638 --> 50:54.758
Get him out of here!

54:24.665 --> 54:26.583
What are you laughing at?

54:27.152 --> 54:28.845
Get out of here!

54:30.716 --> 54:32.799
Boys, stir-fry him.

54:32.552 --> 54:34.565
Hey! Get moving!

54:34.958 --> 54:36.168
Go!

54:37.548 --> 54:38.627
Hey!

54:38.493 --> 54:39.404
Get him!

54:39.461 --> 54:41.412
After him!

54:41.253 --> 54:43.849
After him!

54:58.171 --> 55:01.666
After him! Hurry!

55:04.203 --> 55:05.372
This way!

55:08.015 --> 55:08.988
Ater him! Hurry!

55:14.379 --> 55:16.492
Hurry!

55:17.315 --> 55:20.255
Ater him! Hurry!

55:27.582 --> 55:29.016
Where did he go?

55:29.502 --> 55:33.664
I think he went that way. Let's go!

55:39.798 --> 55:42.180
God! I'm gonna need a shower!

55:41.975 --> 55:44.657
Uncle Lucky, over here!

55:44.375 --> 55:47.003
I know, I know... You can't see I can barely breathe?!

55:47.111 --> 55:49.713
- This guy's wearing me out. 
- Uncle Lucky, hurry!

55:51.314 --> 55:54.708
When criminals know kung fu, they're unstoppable!

56:09.510 --> 56:11.384
Police!

56:18.065 --> 56:20.197
I look good today, right?

56:20.417 --> 56:21.854
Yeah.

56:21.562 --> 56:22.859
You're lucky today,

56:22.561 --> 56:25.402
because you get to be the good cop, and I'll be the bad cop.

56:25.190 --> 56:28.850
With how you look, you couldn't be evil.

56:29.305 --> 56:31.523
I'm more of a bad guy.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.436
Come on, for work.

56:38.171 --> 56:40.027
Out of the way.

56:43.132 --> 56:45.291
You're lucky today,

56:44.982 --> 56:47.864
because you get to be the good cop, and I'll be the bad cop.

56:48.134 --> 56:49.417
Fine.

56:52.142 --> 56:54.235
Dai Yi Yi!

57:03.976 --> 57:06.876
Wow...

57:07.681 --> 57:09.641
What?

57:10.363 --> 57:14.660
Miss Dai, we're very grateful for your cooperation today.

57:14.928 --> 57:16.689
Miss Dai...

57:17.330 --> 57:19.135
Hello.

57:19.722 --> 57:23.667
You probably didn't kill those guys,

57:25.410 --> 57:28.068
Wang Bu Er, I'd like to have a word with you.

57:27.981 --> 57:29.691
Come outside with me.

57:33.034 --> 57:34.916
Go!

57:36.323 --> 57:37.936
Excuse me.

57:39.551 --> 57:41.126
Go!

57:41.561 --> 57:42.893
What was that?

57:42.600 --> 57:44.116
I thought you were the bad cop!

57:44.291 --> 57:46.798
I was playing by instinct.

57:46.464 --> 57:50.001
The minute I stepped in there I just felt she's...

57:49.981 --> 57:51.223
innocent.

57:50.861 --> 57:52.744
innocent my tuchus.

57:52.839 --> 57:55.542
I'll be the bad cop, and you, you don't talk to me.

57:58.700 --> 58:00.643
We know you killed them,

58:00.315 --> 58:01.990
so just come clean,

58:01.664 --> 58:03.914
and we can all save a lot of time.

58:04.334 --> 58:07.878
Fine, I killed them.

58:07.568 --> 58:09.280
Did you really kill them?

58:08.939 --> 58:10.117
No.

58:09.738 --> 58:11.062
Then why did you say you did?

58:10.955 --> 58:13.110
You told me to.

58:12.762 --> 58:14.640
I'm cooperating with the police.

58:14.445 --> 58:16.912
You wanna play games with me?

58:16.787 --> 58:20.598
Sit down, clam down. This is very impolite.

58:20.672 --> 58:22.265
Don't worry.

58:26.232 --> 58:28.787
Why did you make them buy insurance?

58:28.519 --> 58:30.518
Because I sell insurance.

58:30.564 --> 58:34.570
So we have reason to suspect you.

58:34.222 --> 58:38.560
You murdered them for the insurance payouts.

58:38.238 --> 58:39.449
Evidence?

58:39.077 --> 58:41.484
We found these in your house.

58:41.133 --> 58:43.468
They're almost identical to the needle we found

58:43.100 --> 58:44.676
on one of the victims.

58:44.269 --> 58:45.906
How do you explain that?

58:45.588 --> 58:48.066
It's a nomal thing for people to have sewing needles

58:47.701 --> 58:49.892
around the house.

58:49.499 --> 58:51.922
Don't tell me you don't have sewing needles...

58:54.873 --> 58:57.906
You're the national darts champion,

58:57.757 --> 59:00.790
throwing needles would be easy for you.

59:00.854 --> 59:02.409
How do you explain that?

59:01.909 --> 59:04.609
So knowing darts means I can throw needles?

59:04.522 --> 59:07.895
I guess people who play soccer know kickboxing, too.

59:07.832 --> 59:10.097
She has a really good point.

59:10.732 --> 59:13.144
From the stuffy old clothes you're wearing,

59:12.832 --> 59:14.874
and your temper,

59:15.225 --> 59:17.838
I'd say you're chronically single, right?

59:17.508 --> 59:19.856
Who the heck are you talking about, you catty skank?!

59:20.530 --> 59:21.982
Release her!

59:21.658 --> 59:24.678
You bet I will I'm the sergeant here, and I decide when she goes!

59:24.626 --> 59:27.993
Her always is here, and she has an alibi.

59:31.477 --> 59:33.986
You understand me.

59:41.918 --> 59:43.705
Liu Jin Shui.

59:47.464 --> 59:49.336
ID?

59:51.853 --> 59:54.294
Sign here.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.234
Alright, you can go.

01:00:21.998 --> 01:00:23.744
Jin Shui,

01:00:23.997 --> 01:00:25.963
forgive me...

01:00:26.358 --> 01:00:28.688
I just got confused.

01:00:28.912 --> 01:00:31.242
I couldn't resist the temptation.

01:00:33.155 --> 01:00:35.104
But you're the one love.

01:00:37.899 --> 01:00:39.446
Jin Shui,

01:00:39.496 --> 01:00:41.512
you told me once

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:43.580
that the men who date you

01:00:43.404 --> 01:00:45.962
end up under a curse,

01:00:45.897 --> 01:00:47.965
bad things happen to all of them.

01:00:50.838 --> 01:00:52.785
To tell you the truth,

01:00:53.949 --> 01:00:56.670
I tried to quit you,

01:00:58.794 --> 01:01:01.196
but after everything these last few months,

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:04.832
I know I can't...

01:01:09.488 --> 01:01:11.780
If I can be with you,

01:01:13.568 --> 01:01:15.449
I'm not scared of anything.

01:01:19.757 --> 01:01:21.560
Marry me.

01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:43.932
I'd like a plane ticked, Hong Kong to Sanya,

01:01:43.668 --> 01:01:45.631
the earliest you have available.

01:01:51.295 --> 01:01:53.390
Madam, I just saw

01:01:53.034 --> 01:01:55.374
Liu Jin Shui retrieve Gao Min's belongings.

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:56.526
Is she gone?

01:01:56.162 --> 01:01:57.643
Yeah.

01:01:57.285 --> 01:02:00.440
and I heard her booking a ticket fight out of Hong Kong.

01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:12.452
Airport.

01:02:30.921 --> 01:02:33.122
Hello Kitty?

01:02:34.733 --> 01:02:36.757
Officer Wang, what's the problem?

01:02:36.398 --> 01:02:38.174
I need to commandeer your vehicle!

01:02:38.493 --> 01:02:39.857
Why?

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.349
Because I need to follow that car!

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:43.697
Okay! Get in!

01:03:11.324 --> 01:03:12.951
Miss,

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:15.397
it looks like someone is trying to get your attention?

01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:24.078
That's my husband, he had an affair while I was pregnant.

01:03:24.317 --> 01:03:29.052
That pig! I'll lose him for  you.

01:03:55.049 --> 01:03:58.374
Miss, your husband seems like a very clingy man.

01:03:59.532 --> 01:04:02.577
But I have to say I admire his persistence.

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:26.714
Oh my, Officer Wang, you're incredible!

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.031
Take care!

01:05:53.905 --> 01:05:55.442
I lost her.

01:05:55.087 --> 01:05:56.782
You think of something to stop her.

01:05:56.424 --> 01:05:58.200
- We can't let her get on that plane! 
- What? Think of something?!

01:05:57.833 --> 01:06:00.707
What am I supposed to think of? How do I stop her?

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.435
Have a pleasant journey.

01:06:35.246 --> 01:06:37.640
Miss Liu, we'll need you to come with us,

01:06:37.267 --> 01:06:39.543
We have something very important to discuss with you.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:55.705
And this is our female lead, Miss Liu Jin Shui.

01:06:55.384 --> 01:06:57.212
Let's give her a round of applause!

01:07:03.968 --> 01:07:07.308
Wait, what is this?

01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:08.575
We want you to star in a movie.

01:07:08.236 --> 01:07:11.062
Since when do the police make movies?

01:07:10.704 --> 01:07:13.227
We do! Of cause we do.

01:07:12.844 --> 01:07:16.473
The Triads funded "Young and Dangerous", and after that,

01:07:16.261 --> 01:07:17.968
a lot of people wanted to be gangsters.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.147
As police, we had to answer that,

01:07:19.783 --> 01:07:22.244
so we produced a series called "Police Stroy"!

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.404
Then "Police Story 2",

01:07:23.013 --> 01:07:24.972
"Police Story 3 : Super Cop",

01:07:24.587 --> 01:07:26.121
"New Police Story",

01:07:25.715 --> 01:07:27.127
and after that, the sixth one,

01:07:26.645 --> 01:07:30.512
"New New Police Story: the Beautiful Transformer."

01:07:33.276 --> 01:07:35.060
Hey, don't think we're making this up.

01:07:34.672 --> 01:07:38.427
We're the ones

01:07:38.043 --> 01:07:40.083
who made Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh famous!

01:07:39.729 --> 01:07:42.959
so that was you, the Hong Kong police, who made them famous?

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:44.774
I'm just asking

01:07:44.392 --> 01:07:47.483
if you'd like to be as famous as they are?

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:49.958
Speaking as a Hong Kong Royal Police sergeant,

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:51.904
and as a producer,

01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:53.542
I am inviting you to make a movie with us.

01:08:08.057 --> 01:08:09.095
Wang Bu Er?

01:08:16.277 --> 01:08:18.770
You told me to think of something to keep her here.

01:08:21.528 --> 01:08:23.180
Go after her.

01:08:22.969 --> 01:08:24.988
Go!

01:08:33.054 --> 01:08:36.104
You don't want to star a leading role?

01:08:37.429 --> 01:08:39.590
Shut up,

01:08:39.473 --> 01:08:41.345
it's obviously fake.

01:08:41.514 --> 01:08:45.406
Wow, they're idiots! They don't think!

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.425
No movie companies in Hong Kong have the money

01:08:46.064 --> 01:08:49.548
to put on press conferences these days.

01:08:49.554 --> 01:08:50.966
No,

01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:54.417
it's just that

01:08:55.093 --> 01:08:57.995
I know nothing good could ever happen to me.

01:08:59.798 --> 01:09:01.488
There's a place I want to show you.

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:08.684
Look!

01:09:08.591 --> 01:09:09.908
Look!

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:11.870
Do you know how cruel their deaths were?

01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:13.573
No.

01:09:13.455 --> 01:09:15.537
You didn't love them?

01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:16.337
No.

01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:18.469
How cold-blooded are you?

01:09:18.212 --> 01:09:20.041
I don't know who they are.

01:09:26.448 --> 01:09:27.897
Oh, sorry.

01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:30.340
So here these three are,

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:32.566
on more and they can start a Beatles cover band.

01:09:33.265 --> 01:09:38.037
Did you love them?

01:09:37.723 --> 01:09:40.832
Every one of them proposed to me,

01:09:41.024 --> 01:09:45.518
and I said yes to every one and I meant it.

01:09:45.377 --> 01:09:47.537
So what do you think?

01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:52.127
Do you want to know the truth of how they died?

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:54.089
Very much.

01:09:56.739 --> 01:09:58.862
Let me be number four.

01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:00.896
Marry me.

01:10:01.634 --> 01:10:03.914
You're crazy.

01:10:04.396 --> 01:10:08.311
This is my first time proposing in a graveyard, so help me out, alright?

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:11.978
For their sake, at the graves of your exes, say yes... Hey!

01:10:16.722 --> 01:10:21.849
hainan

01:10:36.005 --> 01:10:38.371
I know I was wrong...

01:10:40.942 --> 01:10:43.274
But let's start over, okay?

01:10:43.429 --> 01:10:45.916
Give me another chance!

01:10:48.353 --> 01:10:50.453
Come on, just marry me already!

01:10:50.152 --> 01:10:51.643
Oh shut up!

01:10:51.965 --> 01:10:55.925
You know, that is really mean!

01:11:11.457 --> 01:11:13.321
What are you doing here?

01:11:13.004 --> 01:11:14.480
Waiting for you.

01:11:14.834 --> 01:11:16.576
So you want to marry me?

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:20.381
You want to use a fake marriage with me

01:11:20.057 --> 01:11:21.953
as bait for the real killer?

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.468
Then as of right now, we are engaged.

01:11:35.397 --> 01:11:36.947
Wait, wait, wait...

01:11:37.417 --> 01:11:39.005
What are you doing?

01:11:39.204 --> 01:11:42.427
If we're acting, let's go all the way.

01:11:42.491 --> 01:11:44.913
I brought all my bags.

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.773
Who says lovers have to live together?

01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:50.297
Lovers have to live together.

01:11:51.217 --> 01:11:55.082
For all we know, the real killer might be watching us right now.

01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:57.904
Where?

01:12:00.908 --> 01:12:03.136
He can even see me from there?

01:12:03.857 --> 01:12:05.702
I'm just kidding, don't be scared.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.581
You're crazy.

01:12:18.399 --> 01:12:19.748
Mr. Wang,

01:12:19.438 --> 01:12:21.170
your fiance has finished changing!

01:12:44.588 --> 01:12:47.081
Okay, look this way. Now smile, more.

01:12:46.928 --> 01:12:49.242
Look over here, smile.

01:12:49.384 --> 01:12:51.019
Smile.

01:12:51.382 --> 01:12:52.646
Hey.

01:12:59.368 --> 01:13:02.095
This necklace, it's gorgeous...

01:13:03.409 --> 01:13:05.804
My dad gave it to me years ago.

01:13:05.651 --> 01:13:07.324
With diamond this size,

01:13:07.006 --> 01:13:08.757
you know it's fake.

01:13:10.736 --> 01:13:12.244
Sis?

01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:15.855
You guys... go ahead...

01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:20.875
Congratulations!

01:13:21.918 --> 01:13:24.995
Mom gave you this doll for your birthday.

01:13:25.061 --> 01:13:26.612
Do you remember?

01:13:30.136 --> 01:13:31.772
Of course.

01:13:32.051 --> 01:13:34.589
And then you stole it,

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.980
then broke it.

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:38.359
Actually I kept it,

01:13:38.168 --> 01:13:40.380
and I fixed it.

01:13:40.137 --> 01:13:42.537
This was your favorite toy,

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.707
how could I throw it away?

01:13:44.407 --> 01:13:47.936
Now, it goes back to its owner.

01:13:48.277 --> 01:13:50.123
I want you to be happy.

01:13:51.588 --> 01:13:53.901
I've said some things that weren't nice

01:13:53.643 --> 01:13:56.157
because I wanted you to know what you're up against.

01:13:55.969 --> 01:13:57.730
I wanted you to put that dream away

01:13:57.376 --> 01:13:59.939
and com back to the real world.

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:02.188
Don't blame me for that.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.211
Sis,

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.421
all these years, I've been blaming you.

01:14:14.443 --> 01:14:18.209
I was angry at you for stealing my boyfriends.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.861
I thought you were trying to steal my happiness.

01:14:25.004 --> 01:14:27.727
But I get it now,

01:14:28.271 --> 01:14:31.118
you were just trying to see if they really loved me.

01:14:31.282 --> 01:14:32.786
Thank you!

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:36.283
Sis, don't thank me for that.

01:14:36.245 --> 01:14:38.534
I really just wanted your boyfrineds.

01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:49.368
The Tears of Loneliness,

01:14:49.032 --> 01:14:52.685
Stolen from a New York museum in 2002.

01:14:52.836 --> 01:14:54.722
It was a legendary heist,

01:14:54.411 --> 01:14:56.301
the Debonair Diamond Hijack.

01:14:56.685 --> 01:14:58.036
Get this appraised.

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.788
Yes, Sir!

01:14:58.558 --> 01:14:59.794
Hey!

01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:07.677
Perfect Robberies - History's Five Greatest Art Thefts

01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:29.831
Why did you kill them?

01:16:30.047 --> 01:16:31.470
Because I like murder!

01:16:31.127 --> 01:16:34.045
I Killed all five! Happy now?

01:17:53.053 --> 01:17:55.027
Don't move!

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:56.630
Uncle Liu,

01:17:56.331 --> 01:17:58.433
How do you feel today?

01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:02.535
Where's my cousin?

01:18:02.194 --> 01:18:03.482
Why isn't he here?

01:18:04.031 --> 01:18:05.614
Uncle Liu.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.280
I'm getting married soon.

01:18:09.126 --> 01:18:10.766
Look,

01:18:10.418 --> 01:18:13.641
this is my husband-to-be. His name is Wang Bu Er.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.268
He's stupid, but kind fo cute.

01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:19.010
I think I'm going to be happy with him.

01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:21.922
Uncle Liu.

01:18:22.287 --> 01:18:24.743
we'd like you to be a legal witness of our wedding.

01:18:31.336 --> 01:18:34.070
Your hiding place was almost perfect!

01:18:34.068 --> 01:18:35.788
Too bad you met me!

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.847
Wang Bu Er?

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:38.706
What are you doing here?

01:18:39.163 --> 01:18:40.714
Liu Xing,

01:18:40.562 --> 01:18:43.030
have you actually enjoyed being in bed for three years?

01:18:45.308 --> 01:18:48.387
How can you speak to my uncle like that?

01:18:48.129 --> 01:18:51.294
I saw a photo of your father

01:18:50.964 --> 01:18:52.830
and your uncle together,

01:18:53.121 --> 01:18:56.407
and after I saw the necklace during out wedding photos,

01:18:56.039 --> 01:18:57.869
I finally understood.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.969
Your uncle and your father were celebrities a decade ago, master thieves

01:19:00.757 --> 01:19:04.506
who pulled off a heist at the New York Museum of History!

01:19:04.995 --> 01:19:08.748
Your uncle is the man who's been killing all your boyfriends.

01:19:08.748 --> 01:19:10.139
Shut up!

01:19:10.296 --> 01:19:13.328
My uncle is paralyzed, how could he...

01:19:13.105 --> 01:19:15.869
Your first boyfrined died three years age,

01:19:15.545 --> 01:19:18.447
at the same time your uncle was paralyzed.

01:19:18.207 --> 01:19:21.448
Pretending to be paralyzed was the best way to avoid suspicion.

01:19:21.111 --> 01:19:23.581
Just now, when I fought with your son,

01:19:23.235 --> 01:19:26.140
he took all the responsibility.

01:19:25.788 --> 01:19:28.245
- He said he did it all himself. 
- It was me,

01:19:27.887 --> 01:19:29.943
I killed every on of them!

01:19:29.604 --> 01:19:32.604
But after I saw his skill with the needles, I know...

01:19:32.483 --> 01:19:34.911
I knew there had to someone else.

01:19:48.108 --> 01:19:49.406
You're a very patient man.

01:19:50.198 --> 01:19:52.619
when the first three victims got struck,

01:19:52.258 --> 01:19:55.086
they were moving at high speeds.

01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:59.547
The cause of death

01:19:59.171 --> 01:20:01.453
was a needle striking laughter acupressure point,

01:20:04.254 --> 01:20:08.950
causing instant, total-body muscle paralysis,

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:13.714
which is why they died with a smile on their faces.

01:20:14.785 --> 01:20:17.331
And you were hidden so well, it was almost flawless.

01:20:17.006 --> 01:20:18.468
But of all the mistakes to make,

01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:19.931
tell me why a paralyzed man

01:20:19.595 --> 01:20:22.664
would keep a pair of sandals under his bed?

01:20:26.648 --> 01:20:32.643
So the sandals were what gave it away?

01:20:32.287 --> 01:20:35.134
Sorry, thoses sandals are mine...

01:21:24.068 --> 01:21:26.645
You'll naver escape.

01:21:28.936 --> 01:21:31.495
Can you get up and say that?

01:21:50.366 --> 01:21:51.517
Hey!
01:21:51,854 --> 01:21:52,835
...Get him!

01:21:53.223 --> 01:21:54.954
In this condition? Still?

01:21:54.718 --> 01:21:56.322
...Get him!

01:21:55.999 --> 01:21:57.958
You're not scared you'll die?

01:21:57.615 --> 01:21:59.255
Go get him!

01:21:59.558 --> 01:22:01.610
Are you alright?

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:03.107
Take care of him!

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.302
Where are you going?

01:22:06.323 --> 01:22:08.372
You just told me to go get him!

01:22:15.641 --> 01:22:19.418
Bu Er, are you okay?

01:22:53.351 --> 01:22:54.779
You fool!

01:22:54.445 --> 01:22:57.155
You think you'll be able to fight after running so long?

01:23:35.034 --> 01:23:37.566
Nice moves!

01:25:55.996 --> 01:25:59.015
You can't win, give up.

01:26:11.678 --> 01:26:13.245
Give up?

01:26:15.245 --> 01:26:17.376
To you?

01:26:21.569 --> 01:26:24.833
Seven of you couldn't beat me!

01:26:25.683 --> 01:26:27.056
Well...

01:26:28.067 --> 01:26:29.825
How about eight?

01:27:08.599 --> 01:27:11.827
Wo-tahhhhhhh...

01:27:24.013 --> 01:27:25.972
Your father and your uncle

01:27:25.787 --> 01:27:28.548
were both famous museum thieves.

01:27:29.728 --> 01:27:35.106
When your father was still alive, he left you an inheritance,

01:27:34.938 --> 01:27:38.249
with the condition that you had to be married before age 30,

01:27:37.956 --> 01:27:41.277
otherwise it would automatically pass to your uncle,

01:27:40.919 --> 01:27:42.663
Mr. Liu Xing.

01:27:42.231 --> 01:27:45.522
So, your uncle had to stop you

01:27:45.131 --> 01:27:46.867
from getting married before you turn 30.

01:27:46.446 --> 01:27:49.120
Wouldn't it just be simpler to kill me?

01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:52.914
That's something I don't understand either.

01:27:54.546 --> 01:27:58.252
Your necklace was actually a very important cultural artifact,

01:27:58.207 --> 01:28:00.191
so we've already sent it back to the New York museum.

01:28:00.646 --> 01:28:03.775
That necklace was the last thing my father every gave me.

01:28:04.061 --> 01:28:06.804
Actually, he left you something else.

01:28:07.975 --> 01:28:11.603
This is called "Lily's Ocean".

01:28:11.402 --> 01:28:14.524
It was the item your uncle desired most.

01:28:14.248 --> 01:28:18.373
But even your uncle misunderstood. This isn't a famous painting,

01:28:18.286 --> 01:28:20.172
it's one your father painted himself.

01:28:20.355 --> 01:28:22.716
Your father was one of the world's best art thieves,

01:28:22.406 --> 01:28:24.473
and he had all the treasures he could want.

01:28:24.103 --> 01:28:26.472
But he didn't have a family.

01:28:26.097 --> 01:28:28.083
This is called "Lily's Ocean"

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.434
because your mother's English name was Lily.

01:28:30.069 --> 01:28:32.649
He wanted you to get married before 30

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:35.912
because he wanted to remind you to cherish the people close to you...

01:28:38.362 --> 01:28:42.081
Did you hear that? Cherish the people close to you...

01:28:54.482 --> 01:28:56.005
Uncle Liu,

01:28:56.476 --> 01:28:58.334
how have you been lately?

01:28:59.018 --> 01:29:01.018
Great,

01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:02.960
I don't have to lay in bed all day.

01:29:02.639 --> 01:29:04.316
Uncle Liu,

01:29:05.208 --> 01:29:06.779
there's something I want to know.

01:29:06.533 --> 01:29:10.000
You worked so hard to stop me from getting married,

01:29:10.544 --> 01:29:13.019
but why didn't you just kill me?

01:29:15.962 --> 01:29:18.235
You're family.

01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:21.571
And all these years, you've been taking care of me.

01:29:21.726 --> 01:29:25.624
I was greedy, not evil. How could I kill you ever money?

01:29:27.416 --> 01:29:28.992
Uncle Liu,

01:29:29.663 --> 01:29:31.546
when you get out,

01:29:32.832 --> 01:29:34.495
I'll keep taking care of you.

01:29:39.863 --> 01:29:41.369
Let's go.

01:29:48.686 --> 01:29:50.722
Jin Shui,

01:29:50.701 --> 01:29:52.900
I'm sorry.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.444
You caught a serial killer, and found the thieves

01:30:18.201 --> 01:30:20.027
who robbed the New York museum.

01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:21.647
Two birds with one stone!

01:30:21.659 --> 01:30:23.102
Congratulations!

01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:24.220
You'll get a promotion.

01:30:24.525 --> 01:30:27.771
Huang Fei Hong, you can officially begin your retired life.

01:30:27.699 --> 01:30:28.810
Wang Bu Er,

01:30:30.113 --> 01:30:32.640
You've finally done something not completely stupid. Well done!

01:30:32.432 --> 01:30:35.413
So, you get early retirement and a pension increase,

01:30:35.153 --> 01:30:37.280
and I get nothing.

01:30:38.252 --> 01:30:39.819
Baby!

01:30:43.717 --> 01:30:46.054
Can you believe these women today?

01:30:45.703 --> 01:30:47.391
They don't even get to know you before they come on to you!

01:30:47.099 --> 01:30:48.527
I'll kill you.

01:30:48.636 --> 01:30:50.154
That's my wife.

01:31:03.283 --> 01:31:04.448
Baby!

01:31:04.242 --> 01:31:05.480
Honey,

01:31:05.387 --> 01:31:07.331
honey, you look taller!

01:31:07.002 --> 01:31:09.517
For the sake of our kids, I have to be!

01:31:12.488 --> 01:31:16.488
No wonder he always wants to get off work early.

01:31:17.258 --> 01:31:18.643
Wang Bu Er,

01:31:27.614 --> 01:31:30.631
can I tell you something?

01:31:30.566 --> 01:31:33.940
Did something happen to your new boyfriend?

01:31:33.731 --> 01:31:35.857
No, of couse not.

01:31:36.296 --> 01:31:39.706
But I'm still under the Star of Solitude.

01:31:40.014 --> 01:31:42.656
Well, you shouldn't dwell on these things.

01:31:42.313 --> 01:31:45.042
Luck, love, fate... that can all change in an instant.

01:31:45.391 --> 01:31:50.090
That's right. So I'd like you to help me change my luck.

01:31:50.931 --> 01:31:54.662
Would you be my boyfriend?

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:59.031
That's very flattering,

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:01.786
and I appreciate your frankness, But...

01:32:01.525 --> 01:32:04.086
the truth is, there's no forcing love,

01:32:03.769 --> 01:32:05.943
and there's already...

01:32:06.857 --> 01:32:08.500
someone I have feelings for.

01:32:08.716 --> 01:32:11.989
I had no idea you had such good taste.

01:32:11.937 --> 01:32:16.150
But if you like me, you should just tell me.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:20.608
Bu Er!

01:32:21.305 --> 01:32:27.328
