For your freedom,
a spell.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.645
Yes?

09:09.715 --> 09:12.878
Make this man-noodle Braco
into a walking love magnet!

09:12.952 --> 09:14.943
[Laughs evilly]

09:15.021 --> 09:16.852
This I can do.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.483
But can you pay the price,
Braco?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.584
The price is your
freedom, man.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.994
This price lies outside
of our arrangement.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.032
To receive, you must pay.

09:27.099 --> 09:28.794
Hmm. All right.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.392
Well,
maybe no dark magic.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.266
I'll pay any
price for love!

09:32.338 --> 09:33.566
[Laughs]

09:33.639 --> 09:34.606
Swazaa!

09:34.674 --> 09:36.141
Aaahhh!

09:36.208 --> 09:37.266
Release!

09:37.343 --> 09:39.607
Who's that? What?

09:39.679 --> 09:40.509
Raarghh!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.946
[Sighs]

09:43.015 --> 09:45.040
Am I a walking love magnet?

09:45.117 --> 09:47.085
Well, you paid the price,
no doubt.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.814
And I want to
have your babies.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.219
To the Princess then!

09:50.289 --> 09:51.119
Yo, wait!

09:51.190 --> 09:52.817
What about me?!

09:52.892 --> 09:54.826
And what's your
number-one priority?

09:54.894 --> 09:56.919
To find someone special
to share my life with.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.190
Awesome.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.231
[Chuckles]

09:59.298 --> 10:00.731
You ready to go
on some dates?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.789
Uh, yeah.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.061
Who should I date?

10:03.135 --> 10:05.399
There's a guy named
Braco who's really nice.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.234
Ooh. Where is he?

10:07.306 --> 10:08.466
BRACO:
I'm here!

10:08.541 --> 10:09.599
Braco?!

10:09.675 --> 10:10.733
What happened to you?!

10:10.810 --> 10:12.402
I paid the price for love.

10:12.478 --> 10:13.570
Was it worth it?

10:13.646 --> 10:14.840
Do you love me?

10:14.914 --> 10:16.108
Yes, I love you.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.410
Then marry me!

10:17.483 --> 10:20.316
We'll travel the world,
have adventures,

10:20.386 --> 10:23.753
make the babes,
get fat and weird,

10:23.823 --> 10:26.815
and float up to 50th
dead world, right?

10:26.892 --> 10:28.450
Oh, Braco.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.722
I don't want
any of that mess.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.856
I <i>do</i> love you, but it's
the undifferentiated love

10:33.933 --> 10:36.128
I feel for all
candy citizens.

10:36.202 --> 10:39.831
I couldn't permit one of my
citizens to suffer the way

10:39.905 --> 10:42.237
I saw you
suffering over me.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.139
And so I made you this.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.542
Meet my doppleganger...
Pbot.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.204
[Clunk!]

10:48.280 --> 10:49.804
Uh, this feels super-wrong.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.213
Oh, Braco!

10:51.283 --> 10:52.477
[Smooches]

10:52.551 --> 10:54.451
Let's get out of
this smelly lab.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.714
Okay!

10:55.788 --> 10:57.153
[Snap!]

10:57.223 --> 10:58.417
Thank you, Princess!

10:58.491 --> 11:00.618
Whoo!

11:00.693 --> 11:02.490
You're welcome, my love.

11:02.561 --> 11:03.459
Where is he?

11:03.529 --> 11:04.723
Where's Braco?!

11:04.797 --> 11:06.230
I let him go, Peps.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.198
I knew he couldn't
be happy without me,

11:08.267 --> 11:10.292
so I built him
a robo-wife!

11:10.369 --> 11:11.734
You should have
given him to me!

11:11.804 --> 11:12.668
[Slap]

11:14.006 --> 11:17.601
[Indistinct singing]

11:29.188 --> 11:33.124
[Singing continues]

11:41.000 --> 11:47.991
