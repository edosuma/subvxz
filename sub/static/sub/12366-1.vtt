00:00.606 --> 00:04.256
Hot in Cleveland is recording
in front of a live studio audio.

00:05.196 --> 00:07.340
Airplane mirrors aren't accurate,
are they?

00:07.508 --> 00:09.342
Of course not.

00:12.496 --> 00:13.496
Excuse me,

00:13.848 --> 00:15.093
- are you...
- Yes.

00:15.218 --> 00:18.416
I am Victoria Chase.
One tries to be inconspicuous.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.285
Yes. That hat screams, "ignore me."

00:23.327 --> 00:25.276
Some fans are reluctant
to approach me

00:25.401 --> 00:27.450
<i>Ever since the edge of tomorrow
was canceled.</i>

00:27.575 --> 00:29.861
Playing Honor Saint raven
for the past 27 years

00:29.986 --> 00:32.610
Has been a privilege
and it is always so gratifying

00:32.735 --> 00:35.486
To meet those that
I have moved and touched.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.622
Actually, what I was going to ask was,
"are you comfortable?"

00:41.111 --> 00:43.292
No, but I will be when you
bring me a drink.

00:43.471 --> 00:45.294
- Champagne, three.
- Right away.

00:45.749 --> 00:48.099
Okay, Victoria, put away your phone.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.033
Joy, put away your spreadsheets,

00:50.158 --> 00:52.408
I want to have a toast.
Thank you.

00:53.065 --> 00:54.720
Here's to number 122.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.598
Cash in your miles and fly
to Paris with your best friends.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.061
- This is gonna be fun.
- Yes.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.548
I'm gonna get a napkin.
Be right back.

01:11.855 --> 01:13.114
Anders is on the plane.

01:13.492 --> 01:14.865
Your husband, Anders?

01:15.143 --> 01:16.143
Oh my God!

01:16.702 --> 01:19.036
Just calm down. You didn't know
he was going to Paris?

01:19.205 --> 01:21.706
We haven't spoken in months.
Our lawyers told us.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.666
Your lawyers are right.
Ignore him.

01:24.219 --> 01:26.627
It's just a hideous coincidence.

01:28.642 --> 01:32.383
But what if it's not a coincidence?
What if he's missing me too?

01:32.690 --> 01:34.969
And Los Angeles was filled
with so many sad memories,

01:35.094 --> 01:38.044
He's flying to Paris
to fill a void in his life?

01:39.094 --> 01:42.226
What if this is our "meet on top of the
empire state building" moment?

01:42.395 --> 01:44.562
<i>Have you been watching
sleepless in Seattle again?</i>

01:47.468 --> 01:49.668
But I got it down to once a month.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.445
- I was up for a part in that movie.
- Of course you were.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.156
Igo talk to him.

01:55.521 --> 01:58.658
Remember, romantic comedies
are like cellulite cures.

01:58.783 --> 02:00.633
Every one of them is a lie.

02:03.178 --> 02:04.478
Oh, my goodness.

02:05.998 --> 02:07.548
- Melanie.
- Anders.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.297
I didn't see you get on the plane.
What a surprise.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.715
You're the one full of surprises.
Traveling to Europe,

02:14.840 --> 02:17.219
reading fiction,
and drinking club soda?

02:17.882 --> 02:20.347
I know. Where's your workaholic drunk
of a husband?

02:20.868 --> 02:22.818
I'm divorcing him, but you...

02:24.877 --> 02:26.074
Hi, I'm Kim.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.533
I haven't even gone on a date yet
And he's taking his fiancÃ©e to Paris.

02:39.265 --> 02:40.715
And she's so young.

02:41.742 --> 02:43.270
She's half my age.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.938
Darling,
that really isn't that young.

02:46.575 --> 02:47.875
My fake age.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.939
Oh, my God. She's a child.

02:51.005 --> 02:54.131
I say we kill him and make
his underage whore watch.

02:55.225 --> 02:58.484
Listen, I know how painful this is,
but maybe...

02:58.609 --> 03:01.501
maybe this is your chance
to finally move on.

03:01.988 --> 03:04.142
Mel, you deserve so much better.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.493
She's right.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.978
You're the kindest, most loving
person in the world.

03:08.265 --> 03:10.648
I hope the plane crashes
and kills them both.

03:12.272 --> 03:13.422
Make it stop!

03:13.547 --> 03:15.069
She didn't cause this!

03:16.155 --> 03:17.154
Make it stop!

03:17.322 --> 03:20.665
<i>This is Captain Reid speaking.
All passengers and flight attendants</i>

03:20.790 --> 03:23.118
Please take your seats,
fasten your seat belts.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.119
I knew something
like this would happen.

03:28.244 --> 03:30.644
All the great ones
go down in planes.

03:31.128 --> 03:34.171
<i>We've been cleared for an
emergency landing. Please remain calm.</i>

03:37.890 --> 03:40.885
All I cared about was being successful,
and now I'm gonna die

03:41.010 --> 03:43.597
and I never got married
Or had children!

03:43.766 --> 03:45.672
And I never won a daytime Emmy!

03:45.797 --> 03:49.801
Not even the season I so courageously
battled Lyme disease!

03:50.486 --> 03:52.445
And I've never done
anything impulsive

03:52.570 --> 03:55.526
except get on this plane
and look where that got me!

03:55.694 --> 03:58.044
<i>I need everyone to brace for impact.</i>

03:58.391 --> 04:01.448
- I love you guys.
- I love you too.

04:01.617 --> 04:05.369
And I swear that if I survive this,
I am going to stop being so vain.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.731
And scared of everything.

04:07.856 --> 04:11.860
And I'm never gonna complain
about anything ever, ever again.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.214
<i>We have safely landed in Cleveland.</i>

04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
Cleveland?

04:21.262 --> 04:23.540
Hot In Cleveland 1x01
"Pilot"

04:23.665 --> 04:26.288
Hot In Tracksuit Team
www.forom.com

04:26.413 --> 04:29.143
Logdo, Thirteen, Skualler
and Sososeries

04:29.955 --> 04:31.979
Great. My husband's engaged

04:32.147 --> 04:34.062
and we're in a dive bar
in Cleveland.

04:34.187 --> 04:37.887
I googled Cleveland and get hammered,
And this is what came up.

04:38.012 --> 04:41.363
Along with some very disturbing
pictures of Drew Carey.

04:44.401 --> 04:47.119
Why are the men looking
at us like that?

04:47.288 --> 04:50.683
No, I get recognized a lot,
but this is different.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.325
I remember that look. It's...

04:54.254 --> 04:55.254
Desire.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.297
They're looking at us.

05:00.069 --> 05:01.919
In L.A., they look past us.

05:02.925 --> 05:04.887
- Ladies.
- How you doing?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.292
I feel young and hot...

05:11.270 --> 05:15.069
Like they're undressing me with
their eyes and not finding spanx.

05:15.632 --> 05:18.317
To think that we spend
all that time and effort

05:18.442 --> 05:20.342
and money trying
to look ten years younger

05:20.467 --> 05:23.656
and ten pounds lighter, and all we had
to do was crash-land in Cleveland.

05:24.794 --> 05:27.303
Where all the men look like real men

05:27.428 --> 05:29.620
and the women look like real women.

05:30.044 --> 05:32.744
And everyone's eating
and no one's ashamed.

05:34.782 --> 05:36.543
I'm gonna order chili fries.

05:38.785 --> 05:40.297
Are your chili fries good?

05:40.624 --> 05:42.224
Can Lebron James jump?

05:44.013 --> 05:45.513
Can who do what now?

05:47.021 --> 05:48.171
They're good.

05:48.506 --> 05:50.506
We'll have three orders and...

05:51.384 --> 05:52.984
Three not-light beers.

05:54.063 --> 05:56.563
Coming right up, and the guys
at that table over there,

05:56.732 --> 05:58.607
would like for you to join them.

05:59.515 --> 06:02.393
Look how adorably
heterosexual they are.

06:03.453 --> 06:05.603
In L.A., it's always a question.

06:06.802 --> 06:09.284
Okay, girls.
Let's go have some fun.

06:09.409 --> 06:12.204
- Oh, why the hell not?
- Wait. Are you sure?

06:12.457 --> 06:14.305
We appear to have landed
in a dimension

06:14.430 --> 06:16.467
where men hit on women
their own age.

06:16.592 --> 06:18.942
We owe it to science to investigate.

06:21.983 --> 06:23.299
Are you guys leaving?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.592
No, we're just pulling your
chairs out for you.

06:25.949 --> 06:28.249
- <i>They have gentlemen here.</i>
- Nice.

06:30.975 --> 06:33.524
- Have an onion ring.
- I might do that.

06:34.548 --> 06:37.229
- Hi, my name is Hank.
- Hi, Hank. Melanie.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.897
- I'm bill.
- James.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.525
- And this is Joy and I'm...
- We know who you are.

06:41.787 --> 06:43.038
Victoria Chase.

06:43.329 --> 06:46.091
I got addicted to edge of tomorrow
One summer I got laid up.

06:46.216 --> 06:49.533
The year you were Honor Saint Raven
and her evil sister Silver Saint Raven.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.953
And her even eviler sister
Magnolia Saint Raven.

06:54.842 --> 06:57.037
Many daytime actors
have done dual roles,

06:57.162 --> 06:59.862
But I was the first one
to tackle a triple.

07:00.138 --> 07:01.788
And the Emmy goes to...

07:02.693 --> 07:03.793
Susan Lucci.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.716
Finally!

07:06.868 --> 07:09.218
So, Melanie, are you an actress too?

07:10.972 --> 07:12.422
Well, you could be.

07:12.547 --> 07:16.119
You remind me of that really
pretty actress who was in that...

07:16.244 --> 07:18.396
that movie.
I can't remember her name.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.980
It doesn't matter.

07:23.464 --> 07:25.232
So what brings you guys here?

07:25.357 --> 07:27.279
Actually, we're on our way to Paris.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.916
Melanie wrote this book called

07:29.041 --> 07:31.190
<i>200 things every woman should
do before she dies,</i>

07:31.315 --> 07:33.911
And she figured she really
should do at least one of them.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.206
Yes, and number 122 is fly
to Paris with your best friends.

07:38.295 --> 07:41.043
A writer and an actress.
So what do you do?

07:41.421 --> 07:44.046
You're looking at the eyebrow
queen of Beverly hills.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.048
I do a lot of celebrities.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.270
Mostly women.

07:47.395 --> 07:49.608
Oprah, Cher, Ryan Seacrest.

07:53.699 --> 07:54.848
Shot in the dark.

07:55.027 --> 07:57.101
Are you ladies all unattached?

07:57.269 --> 07:58.525
At the moment.

07:58.650 --> 08:00.604
Melanie's going
through a divorce, and

08:00.772 --> 08:02.815
Victoria's been married,
like, 20 times.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.110
Which in L.A. is, like, five,
and for an actress is barely one.

08:07.686 --> 08:08.890
Here we go, ladies.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.351
Only cheese fries?

08:14.476 --> 08:16.924
You girls are light eaters, huh?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.024
To Cleveland!

08:27.954 --> 08:29.633
God, what were we thinking?

08:29.802 --> 08:32.419
Alcohol and salt and trans fats?

08:33.586 --> 08:37.589
I know. French fry grease is literally
sweating from my pores.

08:42.585 --> 08:44.188
I wonder if Mel's up yet.

08:44.835 --> 08:46.035
I'll call her.

08:49.898 --> 08:51.948
Melanie Moretti's room, please.

08:52.898 --> 08:53.898
Really?

08:54.607 --> 08:56.157
She never checked in.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.871
Should we be worried?

08:59.039 --> 09:01.707
No, it's Melanie.
She never does anything crazy.

09:08.324 --> 09:10.024
I'm moving to Cleveland.

09:11.945 --> 09:13.745
You're such a little slut.

09:15.774 --> 09:17.139
I know, right?

09:18.854 --> 09:22.639
Oh, my God. You guys,
Hank is so amazing and sweet.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.321
He told me that I was luscious.

09:26.996 --> 09:28.696
He said I was delicious.

09:29.644 --> 09:32.144
I tell you,
it's the French fry grease.

09:35.278 --> 09:36.528
He's a plumber.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.758
Right? Right?

09:38.883 --> 09:40.994
I mean, how many times
have we fantasized

09:41.119 --> 09:43.769
about a man who could
actually fix things?

09:44.471 --> 09:46.078
He showed me all around Cleveland

09:46.203 --> 09:48.295
and I'm telling you,
It's nothing like we think.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.129
They have symphonies
and museums and light opera.

09:51.254 --> 09:54.615
Okay, so nobody really likes
those things, but they have 'em!

09:54.740 --> 09:56.261
We hear what you're saying,

09:56.525 --> 09:58.388
But you've lost your freaking mind.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.986
I'm telling you,
I'm moving to Cleveland.

10:02.111 --> 10:04.895
Melanie, friends don't
let friends move to Cleveland.

10:06.110 --> 10:08.310
Just take a look at this listing.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.937
"For sale or lease,

10:14.146 --> 10:17.603
Victorian with guest cottage,
7,000 square feet"...

10:18.526 --> 10:21.720
Well, that price has got
to be missing a zero.

10:22.470 --> 10:23.509
Oh, my God.

10:23.634 --> 10:25.326
I know, right?
It's amazing?

10:25.451 --> 10:27.351
No, it's a picture of Oprah.

10:28.390 --> 10:29.796
Look at those brows.

10:30.193 --> 10:31.643
That's not my arch.

10:32.011 --> 10:34.132
She's being plucked by someone else.

10:34.427 --> 10:36.078
It was probably retouched.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.011
I mean, I get all of my photos...

10:38.136 --> 10:40.586
I mean, I hear that people
do do that.

10:41.811 --> 10:45.661
I've built my business on being
the salon that does Oprah's brows.

10:45.864 --> 10:48.186
This is the work
of that Russian chick on rodeo.

10:48.311 --> 10:49.711
Bloody Foreigners.

10:52.377 --> 10:54.945
Well, would looking at
cheap real estate cheer you up?

10:55.376 --> 10:59.011
Probably not, but I just can't
lie here licking my wounds.

10:59.761 --> 11:00.811
Although...

11:06.874 --> 11:08.574
I love it. I'll take it.

11:09.153 --> 11:10.460
What are you doing?

11:10.629 --> 11:12.859
We're getting on a plane
for Paris tomorrow.

11:12.984 --> 11:15.994
I was going to Paris to find romance,
but I've found it here,

11:16.119 --> 11:18.135
and I get to keep all my miles.

11:19.285 --> 11:20.554
This is crazy.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.544
Look, it's a month-to-month lease,

11:22.669 --> 11:24.924
And a month here costs
the same as a night in Paris.

11:25.049 --> 11:26.685
- Here you go.
- And here you go.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.397
Now there's just one thing about
this place that I should mention.

11:30.745 --> 11:33.045
Why are you renting to prostitutes?

11:38.332 --> 11:40.055
This is Elka Ostrovsky.

11:40.180 --> 11:42.233
She's a caretaker
who comes with the house,

11:42.358 --> 11:43.906
If you wish to retain her.

11:44.031 --> 11:46.321
She stays out in the guest cottage.

11:46.446 --> 11:48.540
I'll leave you to get
all that worked out.

11:53.107 --> 11:54.671
Hi. I'm Melanie.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.427
I'm gonna be leasing the place.

11:56.552 --> 11:59.652
I've been the caretaker
of this house for 50 years,

11:59.777 --> 12:01.477
but you can kick me out.

12:04.186 --> 12:05.682
- I wouldn't...
- No worries.

12:05.851 --> 12:09.300
If you can escape from the Nazis,
you can handle anything.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.773
You escaped from the Nazis?

12:13.032 --> 12:16.182
Escaping from the Nazis
was the least of my worries.

12:18.309 --> 12:20.709
Well, you don't
hear that very often.

12:21.687 --> 12:23.537
So what are you, like, 100?

12:24.897 --> 12:26.247
I don't like you.

12:28.068 --> 12:29.998
Aren't you that girl from that show?

12:30.239 --> 12:32.376
Yes, yes, I am.
Are you a fan?

12:35.972 --> 12:38.872
When it was cancelled,
I said, "good riddance."

12:48.813 --> 12:50.560
Does anyone else smell pot?

12:51.621 --> 12:53.121
What are you, a cop?

12:55.388 --> 12:56.988
Then what's it to you?

13:00.396 --> 13:03.281
I can't wait to tell Hank.
He said he'd call.

13:03.559 --> 13:05.359
They all say they'll call.

13:10.959 --> 13:12.409
It's him. It's him.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.553
That's shameful.

13:16.143 --> 13:19.409
I haven't even looked
at another man since 1949.

13:20.953 --> 13:23.003
When the husband dies, you die.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.803
But you're not dead.

13:25.886 --> 13:27.136
Inside you die.

13:28.511 --> 13:30.942
Oh, you still maintain the Shell.

13:36.776 --> 13:40.335
I have a date.
My first date in 25 years.

13:40.624 --> 13:42.881
He wants me to meet him
at the Windy Highland Marina.

13:43.006 --> 13:45.640
- Do you know where that is?
- It's where whores go.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.094
You're too old to act like this.

13:50.219 --> 13:52.497
She's not old.
40 is the new 30.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.350
And 50 is the new 40.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.050
- What's 80?
- It's still 80.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.145
And I still don't like you.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.423
Apparently I have a caretaker,
whatever that means.

14:05.548 --> 14:06.967
I also have a date.

14:07.317 --> 14:09.181
Hank is making dinner
for me on his boat.

14:09.559 --> 14:11.933
Plumbers in Cleveland
can afford boats?

14:13.097 --> 14:14.481
This is crazy.

14:14.606 --> 14:17.939
You're uprooting your whole life
for some guy you met at a bar?

14:18.108 --> 14:20.108
I mean, what do you
even know about this guy?

14:20.452 --> 14:22.702
I know that
I've never felt so alive.

14:22.827 --> 14:25.177
And you know what?
Maybe at our age,

14:25.302 --> 14:27.365
we're just supposed
to pounce on these things.

14:28.379 --> 14:29.659
My kids are in college.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.000
Anders has clearly moved on.

14:33.197 --> 14:36.208
So why am I gonna rush back to L.A.
and a very empty house?

14:38.748 --> 14:39.878
Don't wait up.

14:42.447 --> 14:45.668
- What are you doing?
- What Melanie should have done.

14:45.901 --> 14:47.052
Googling Hank.

14:47.473 --> 14:49.557
Good idea. Let's find out
about this guy.

14:49.682 --> 14:52.377
Put in "Hank, plumber, Cleveland,

14:52.802 --> 14:54.309
Windy Highland Marina."

14:55.319 --> 14:57.346
This is why the Internet
was invented.

14:57.471 --> 14:59.459
For men to find pictures
of naked celebrities

14:59.584 --> 15:02.150
and women to cyber-stalk
the men they trust.

15:02.683 --> 15:04.622
Look. Okay, here's an image of him

15:04.747 --> 15:06.447
from a month ago with...

15:07.543 --> 15:08.543
his wife.

15:08.971 --> 15:11.308
Well, who didn't see that coming?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.007
What would be on your list?

15:20.570 --> 15:22.771
- Honestly?
- No, lie to me.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.462
Honestly,
I have always wanted to learn

15:28.969 --> 15:29.970
to tango.

15:30.361 --> 15:33.181
Yeah. Rose in my teeth.
The whole bit.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.338
- Oh, my God. Me too!
- Really?

15:35.463 --> 15:38.813
- Let's do it together.
- That would be... I'd really...

15:39.417 --> 15:40.480
really like that.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.116
Melanie, there's...

15:44.351 --> 15:46.486
there's something I really
think you should know,

15:46.750 --> 15:48.000
and I have been

15:48.634 --> 15:50.365
picturing myself telling you

15:50.825 --> 15:53.493
and coming up with these
really awful scenarios.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.117
He's married!

15:57.327 --> 15:59.677
Not that bad, but kind of like that.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.426
Oh, my God.

16:02.805 --> 16:05.577
That's what you were trying...
Oh, my God.

16:05.702 --> 16:07.002
Melanie, please.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.050
Please don't.
Stop, stop, stop!

16:09.219 --> 16:10.668
You can just leave.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.408
- But this is my boat.
- Just go!

16:16.199 --> 16:17.599
Please just don't.

16:22.379 --> 16:23.629
What can we do?

16:24.525 --> 16:25.775
Let's kill him.

16:26.938 --> 16:28.777
That's your solution to everything.

16:28.902 --> 16:31.052
Well, could we just try it once?

16:32.528 --> 16:35.701
I just wanted to feel
young and stupid.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.066
Now I just feel stupid.

16:40.427 --> 16:41.677
Stupid and old.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.487
You're not old.

16:43.612 --> 16:45.091
40 is the new 25.

16:45.764 --> 16:47.339
I thought 40 was the new 30.

16:47.678 --> 16:51.078
If we're just gonna make
crap up, I'd rather be 25.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.554
- Excuse me.
- I said go away!

16:54.723 --> 16:57.891
- There's something I need to say.
- You've said and done quite enough.

16:58.436 --> 17:01.436
I didn't go to that bar
with this in mind,

17:01.604 --> 17:04.546
but then three incredibly
beautiful, sophisticated women

17:04.671 --> 17:06.273
came in and sat down at my table.

17:07.430 --> 17:08.430
Go on.

17:12.324 --> 17:16.123
You were so breathtakingly beautiful
that I couldn't stop myself.

17:16.248 --> 17:17.993
I am a plumber

17:18.261 --> 17:19.996
who's stuck in a bad marriage and

17:20.165 --> 17:23.375
who hurt someone he never
should have hurt. I am so sorry.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.715
For sophisticated ladies, we shouldn't
have burst in on you like that.

17:30.733 --> 17:34.737
But when one of us is in trouble,
then nothing else in the world matters.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.188
My God. It's my agent.
Everybody, just shut up.

17:38.313 --> 17:39.683
He thinks I'm in Paris.

17:42.448 --> 17:43.498
Oui, hello?

17:49.580 --> 17:51.380
Well, let's talk tomorrow.

17:52.147 --> 17:55.990
Well, I have an audition
for the next transformers movie.

17:57.249 --> 17:59.327
- What part?
- To play Megan fox's

18:00.123 --> 18:01.223
grandmother.

18:03.259 --> 18:05.918
If anybody thinks you look
like a grandma, they're crazy.

18:06.347 --> 18:08.420
Thank you. He's a keeper.

18:13.549 --> 18:16.899
Oh, God, I don't wanna audition
for grandmothers' parts.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.764
I loved being the queen of daytime.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.350
I've put everything in my business.

18:23.988 --> 18:26.271
If that doesn't work out,
I've got nothing.

18:26.699 --> 18:27.699
Or...

18:28.164 --> 18:30.275
you have the chance
to change something.

18:30.958 --> 18:31.958
Number 72.

18:32.693 --> 18:34.143
Re-invent yourself.

18:35.972 --> 18:38.172
Oh, God, I really want to do that.

18:39.465 --> 18:41.615
I know it may sound crazy, but...

18:42.260 --> 18:44.210
I think I wanna do that here.

18:45.279 --> 18:49.210
You're not gonna become one of those
women who like themselves, are you?

18:50.713 --> 18:52.913
Cause everybody hates those women.

18:54.541 --> 18:56.009
Let me ask you something.

18:56.434 --> 18:59.434
What's the deal with old ladies
and track suites?

19:00.502 --> 19:01.556
It's simple.

19:01.865 --> 19:03.803
In your twenties you dress for men.

19:03.928 --> 19:06.378
In your forties
you dress for success.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.595
In your eighties you dress
for the bathroom.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.101
Should all move on.

19:22.925 --> 19:25.080
So, too bad about that married guy.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.725
When I was your age, we didn't get
into that kind of trouble.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.006
My husband was
the only man I ever dated.

19:35.537 --> 19:39.302
Didn't you wanna try another one out,
I mean, you know, just to compare?

19:43.871 --> 19:45.517
That's a sinful thought.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.030
So, you're OK, Mel?

19:51.820 --> 19:52.899
Yeah, I'm good.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.000
You guys have
a very early flight tomorrow.

19:55.125 --> 19:58.215
So please, just go to Paris
and have a wonderful time.

19:58.340 --> 20:02.084
I don't know. Somehow I can't seem
to get excited about Paris anymore.

20:04.378 --> 20:05.428
Your joy...

20:06.601 --> 20:10.605
Instead of two weeks in Paris we could
spend 2 weeks in Cleveland. I mean...

20:10.731 --> 20:12.131
The Paris of Ohio.

20:13.621 --> 20:15.021
No, that's Toledo.

20:19.441 --> 20:20.760
What should we do now?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.388
I say...

20:22.588 --> 20:24.556
We go to that bar
where men think we're hot.

20:24.866 --> 20:25.916
I'll drive.
