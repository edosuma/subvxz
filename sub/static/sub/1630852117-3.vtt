00:58.433 --> 00:59.267
Yo, C.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.233
-How'd you get in here?
-The other gentleman let us in.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.652
Would it be okay to start in here now?

01:10.820 --> 01:12.864
Yeah, please. Yeah, go ahead.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.001
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What's up, champ?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.087
Time to get that work in, baby.
It's gym time.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.756
Yes, sir. Give me a minute,
lemme throw my shit on.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.424
All right, cool.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.553
We're gonna hit them legs today.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.430
-Yes, sir.
-Mm-hmm.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.321
<i>A lot of people kid themselves.</i>

01:53.905 --> 01:57.408
<i>They… They know when they were born,</i>
<i>they know where they're going,</i>

01:57.492 --> 02:00.328
<i>they know about whether</i>
<i>they're gonna go to heaven, to hell.</i>

02:00.411 --> 02:02.372
<i>They think they know. They kid themselves.</i>

02:02.455 --> 02:04.332
<i>But the only people who are,</i>
<i>you know, happy</i>…

02:05.875 --> 02:08.461
<i>…are the people</i>
<i>who are comfortable. That's right.</i>

02:51.212 --> 02:52.213
Yeah.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.923
<i>Yeah. Your brother's in town.</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:56.426
<i>You promised you'd have</i>
<i>our fucking money when he got here.</i>

02:56.509 --> 02:58.761
Yeah. Well, look, it's a lot of money.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.889
You know, I gotta move slow.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.682
<i>Slow gets your legs broken, Carlton.</i>

03:02.765 --> 03:05.560
<i>Slow gets you one eye</i>
<i>like Sammy Davis. Don't go slow.</i>

03:05.643 --> 03:08.813
Hey, Savvas. I'm gonna have
your money this week, all right?

03:09.439 --> 03:10.523
<i>Good. Hang on.</i>

03:11.191 --> 03:13.359
<i> I'll ask him</i>
<i>about our brother now,</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:14.694
<i>see what he has to say.</i>

03:15.862 --> 03:17.238
<i>Carlton, you seen Ari?</i>

03:18.656 --> 03:19.741
Ari?

03:19.824 --> 03:23.786
Nah, nah. Like, I seen him, like,
day before yesterday, something like that.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.913
<i>-Yesterday?</i>
-Yeah.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.289
<i>When?</i>

03:26.789 --> 03:29.542
I don't wear a watch.
Three, four, something like that.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.419
He was hounding me for that money too.

03:31.502 --> 03:34.297
<i>He saw him the day before</i>
<i>yesterday, but he doesn't know yet.</i>

03:34.380 --> 03:36.591
<i>Come to the club tonight, Carlton.</i>

03:36.674 --> 03:40.345
<i>-Nikos and I wanna talk to you.</i>
-Yeah, okay. All right. Yeah.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.557
Come to the club. Yep.
Turn it up. All right. See you there.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.607
Mm.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.237
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna get something to eat.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.490
Cool, man, then Cosmic Jack at 5:00?

04:42.573 --> 04:43.950
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

04:44.033 --> 04:44.951
Hey.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.372
I hope you understand, I was dealing
with a lot of shit yesterday, Hersch.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.045
Yeah, I get it, man.
You know, shit tough on you right now.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.548
I appreciate you, though.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.551
I appreciate everybody I got around me.

05:01.634 --> 05:05.805
Every last person.
I appreciate the fuck out of you all, man.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.266
-All right, here we go. I'm out, man.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.225
All right, man.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.893
-Want me to go with you?
-No. You good.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.021
-Okay. Cool. In a minute.
-In a minute!

05:13.104 --> 05:13.938
Appreciate you, man.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.275
Mm-mm-mmm.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.281
Hmm. Looking for new material?

05:24.907 --> 05:28.578
No. That stuff has a weird way
of just falling on my lap.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.579
Oh.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.083
I'm sorry that I ran up on you yesterday.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.084
That was…

05:35.585 --> 05:37.837
I don't know if you are,
'cause you're doing it again.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.882
-Oh, right…
-I'm fucking with you.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.093
-It's a joke.
-Yeah, okay.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.555
I actually owe you an apology.
Yesterday was a little crazy for me.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.682
I had a lot of shit going on.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.769
But today is much better.
I'm in a better space, so…

05:52.852 --> 05:53.811
Good for you.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.230
-I mean, who needs crazy in their lives?
-Not me.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.692
That's for damn sure.
I got way too much of it.

06:00.568 --> 06:04.530
And I do remember you, you were
introducing yourself again, but…

06:05.198 --> 06:07.450
I remember you from
last time I was here, like a year ago.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.826
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I was on tour.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.412
And you were very specific
about getting my egg white order right.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.413
Mm-hmm.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.333
But you didn't come to the show,
I left you tickets, you never came.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.879
I was going through it with my ex.
I mean, he wasn't my ex then but…

06:19.962 --> 06:20.797
Got it.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.258
You like standing up
over sitting down, or…?

06:24.342 --> 06:25.676
Oh! For…

06:25.760 --> 06:27.387
-Yeah, okay.
-Yes, please.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.764
Talking about break-ups, take a load off.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.351
-I can relate, I'm going through a damn--
-Divorce.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.269
-Yeah.
-I saw.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.315
-How are you handling it?
-The divorce?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.316
Mm-hmm.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.736
Not well.
It is what it is, what you gonna do?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.572
Yeah, me too.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.283
I haven't even been on a date

06:49.367 --> 06:51.911
since me and that fool
I was in love with broke up.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.162
Not one date?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.998
-Nothing. No. Nothing.
-None? Wow.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.042
Not one.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.977

07:16.060 --> 07:19.272
You can, but fans' hearts break

07:19.355 --> 07:22.400
A little slip up, we're gonna
get it cleaned up. Okay?

07:22.483 --> 07:23.401
What's next?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.029
<i>Yeah, I'll go.</i>
<i>Uh, Kid called other night.</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:30.616
<i>He asked me to put,</i>
<i>like, 500K together, immediately.</i>

07:31.492 --> 07:33.828
<i>He said he wanted</i>
<i>to "do more for Carlton."</i>

07:33.911 --> 07:35.788
Jesus. Okay, what'd you say?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.832
<i>-I said that we should wake you up.</i>
Good.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.417

<i> Guys,</i>
<i>Carlton's not the only problem.</i>

07:41.294 --> 07:43.838

07:43.921 --> 07:46.048

07:46.132 --> 07:48.259
Okay, everybody take a breath, okay?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.513
Isn't there a way maybe that helps us?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.223
<i>Wait, how?</i>

07:54.307 --> 07:56.642
Well, you know,
everybody's up the guy's ass.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.020
Isn't it a lot more appealing
to go away for six months?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.438
Get out of the public eye.

08:00.521 --> 08:03.107
Do the sequel to a huge blockbuster movie?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.943
-We're not gonna push him that way, but--

08:06.027 --> 08:07.570
Guys, I gotta go. This is my wife.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.531
Terry, you do not move that money
until you hear from me. Okay?

08:10.615 --> 08:11.699
<i>Got it.</i>
-Bye.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.244
-Hey.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.371
-Okay.
<i>-It read a little frantic. You okay?</i>

08:17.455 --> 08:19.540
Yeah. I am. I am. Um…

08:19.624 --> 08:22.668
I reached out 'cause, um,
look, Kid is up to his old shit again.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.963
And it is getting to me in…
in ways that I just…

08:26.547 --> 08:29.550
I thought I was over. It's… getting to me.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.928
<i>Are you staying on track with your eating?</i>

08:32.678 --> 08:35.097
Yeah. Um… about that.

08:46.734 --> 08:47.735
What up, champ?

08:48.486 --> 08:49.320
Man!

08:50.655 --> 08:53.366
Dude, I really feel like we're gonna
get away with this shit, man.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.701
We got a problem.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.955
-What problem?
-Ari's scumbag brothers want to see me.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.333
-Why?
-Probably to ask if I've seen Ari.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.586
Yeah, I went through his phone and, uh…

09:06.295 --> 09:08.214
he didn't tell 'em
he was coming to see us, so…

09:08.297 --> 09:09.549
Why do you have the phone?

09:10.007 --> 09:13.219
What if he has Find my Friends
or some shit like that on his phone?

09:13.302 --> 09:15.638
Criminals don't use Find my Friends, K.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.642
Besides, it's a burner phone,
you can't trace it.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.645
All right, so, you go see 'em.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.064
After you go see 'em,
you tell 'em that you ain't seen Ari.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.026
Yeah.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.487
-Little more complicated than that.
-Why's that?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.872
They're my silent investors
in the restaurant.

09:41.956 --> 09:42.832
I'm sorry?

09:44.542 --> 09:48.045
They're my silent investors
in the restaurant.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.463
I'm into 'em deep.

09:51.090 --> 09:51.966
Real deep.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.218
How much?

09:56.721 --> 09:57.972
Six hundred thousand.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.520
You don't think that's information
I'm supposed to know?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.856
God, man!

10:07.523 --> 10:09.817
All the money that you've taken from me,

10:09.900 --> 10:13.279
and now you took 600K from
Greek gangsters whose brother we killed?

10:17.241 --> 10:18.701
Give me your phone.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.786
-What you gonna do?
-Gimme your phone.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.708
Here.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.960
All right, okay.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.049
Yo, look, you know who this is.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.301
Uh, quick video message
to let you guys know

10:35.384 --> 10:38.054
that I'm gonna go ahead
and pay Carlton's $600,000 debt.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.222
I'll wait for Monday morning,
the banks open,

10:40.306 --> 10:41.974
I'll wire you guys the money ASAP.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.978
Uh, this is a visual
and verbal contract between us.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.438
All debts will be paid.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.691
-All right, done. Listen to me, bro.
-Oh, bro….

10:50.775 --> 10:52.401
Hey, listen. This is what I wanna do.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.154
All right, give them this.
Let them see the video.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.615
When they see the video,
they'll know they got their money.

10:57.698 --> 11:01.118
When they know, that takes away
all motives of you killing Ari.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.453
There's no reason for you.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.830
Uh, bro…

11:06.415 --> 11:08.834
I mean, this is way over the top, but…

11:08.918 --> 11:11.420
-I really appreciate you. Really.
-Yeah.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.214
Oh, man.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.132
Fuck.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.679
C, if we get through this, we good.

11:20.304 --> 11:21.263
Yeah.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.433
I mean…

11:25.059 --> 11:26.686
Hate losing the restaurant and everything.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.856
C, the restaurant, that shouldn't even
be a thought right now, man.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.859
-That's not the priority, man.
-Right.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.113
The priority is getting through this.

11:38.030 --> 11:38.948
All right?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.660
Maybe you come on the road with me
for the next couple weeks.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.537
-Word?
-Yeah.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.332
Come on the road. We… We chill.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.752
We do whatever it is that we do.
Right? Let things settle down.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.630
Then we come back,
we talk about the restaurant then.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.508
You wanna open it? We discuss that then.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.094
-I'm with that.
-Yeah.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.929
-I'm with that.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.348
That's Hersch.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.393
I've got radio promo
I gotta do with Cosmic Jack.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.479
Cosmic Jack hates you.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.982
Talks shit about you all the time.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.903
You don't think you should call
and defend me, jackass?

12:17.987 --> 12:18.988
No.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.156
You're rich.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.240
Got it made.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.908
Got a great life.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.786
He spends most of his day
in a radio booth.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.538
That's a good point.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.209
Look, I'm gonna go get some rest.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.546
Clear my head,
so I don't say something stupid.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.882
Why don't you
come to the show when you're done?

12:37.965 --> 12:40.217
Yeah, if I don't get gutted like a fish.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.846
I think it's too soon
for that joke. Don't you?

12:48.851 --> 12:50.186
Coming, coming, coming.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.189
-Hey.
-What up, champ?

12:53.731 --> 12:56.734
Uh, just grab a second
before Cosmic Jack.

12:56.817 --> 12:57.860
Yeah.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.697
Um, I wanna…
I'm just checking in with you, man.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.741
Yesterday was like…

13:04.575 --> 13:06.911
Haven't seen
that version of you in a long time.

13:07.578 --> 13:08.662
It was a tough day.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.123
-It was.
-Yeah, I had a tough one.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.794
I had a lot of shit going on. You know?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.505
I didn't deal with it properly,
so it kept building up,

13:17.588 --> 13:19.632
and before I knew it, I don't know,

13:20.132 --> 13:22.092
I was just being an asshole, my fault.

13:23.093 --> 13:26.263
I'm not looking for an apology,
I'm just checking in with you. For real.

13:26.889 --> 13:30.226
I'm glad you came up, man.
I wanted to talk to you about the whole…

13:31.393 --> 13:32.895
All this Carlton shit.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.231
Everything that's going on.
I kind of feel like…

13:36.190 --> 13:38.901
because there's so much,
I need to cut him a break.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.946
Oh. That's not
what I thought you were gonna say.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.199
No, listen,
my reason for saying that is because,

13:45.282 --> 13:48.118
regardless of the money issues
or all his fuck-ups,

13:48.202 --> 13:51.497
I don't want that shit to become mine.
Like, I don't wanna deal with it.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.458
Right, but it's Carlton
we're talking about. It comes back on you.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.751
I know that, Todd.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.255
I know what you're saying.
I know where you're coming from.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.216
I know why,
'cause you're like a brother to me.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.885
But I want you to understand,
he is my actual brother.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.681
There isn't a world where I can leave that
man hanging. I have to be there for him.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.766
Regardless of the problems,
it is what it is.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.601
I'd never ask you to not do that.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.145
I just gotta
speak my truth on this though.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.774
I respect your love for your brother
and I have your back.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.235
My guy.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.655
All right.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.449
Hersch is in the Sprinter,
we're good to go.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.910
Done. Where's, uh, where's Billie at?

14:31.203 --> 14:34.081
-I don't know, gave her the afternoon off.
-Uh, well, call her.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.749
She can come to the radio station,

14:35.833 --> 14:37.918
and I can go over
the beginning of the show.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.753
I wanna talk to her
about some other stuff.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.047
-I've got good news for her.
-Okay. I'll call her up.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.442
-I'm hungry. Y'all hungry?
-Oh, yes.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.527
I need to eat, man. Oh, here we go.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.281
Okay, listen, guys,
when I come back,

15:07.364 --> 15:10.284
I will try my best to get everybody,
but we gotta run. Okay?

15:10.367 --> 15:12.036
-Can we talk?
-Gene. Hey. Listen.

15:12.119 --> 15:15.080
Yesterday, man, my bad.
I snapped on you, I shouldn't have.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.875
I was having a shitty day.
That's my bad. I'll take that, okay?

15:17.958 --> 15:19.543
Okay. I just need one minute.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.671
How about I make it better for you?
VIP tickets to my show tonight.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.672
Deal?

15:24.298 --> 15:25.341
Huh?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.843
-Really?
-Yeah, solid. Todd, do that for me.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.887
At will call, okay?
We got tickets for you.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.805
We gotta go, we're gonna be late.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.812
Jay and Beyoncé wanna
throw you an after-party at Up&Down

15:38.896 --> 15:40.689
after the Madison Square Garden opening.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.858
-Cool?
-Yes, very nice. I'm into that.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.776
Okay.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.569
And, um…

15:47.196 --> 15:48.989
…we don't have to decide <i>now</i> now,

15:49.073 --> 15:51.492
but the studio
is all over me about the sequel.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.827
They wanna just start to negotiate.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.830
-And I think there's no reason not--
-Todd, listen to me.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.165
Tell them I'm in.

15:59.833 --> 16:00.668
Really?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.211
Dead-ass. Tell them I'll do it.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.048
-Okay.
-All right.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.009
-It's a sequel. How bad can it be? Huh?
-It can't… I--

16:09.635 --> 16:10.970
Billie, what do you think?

16:11.053 --> 16:13.847
-You think it's a good idea?
-Yeah, if you say it is, boss.

16:13.931 --> 16:14.890
What is that?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.893
What's that?
That's not convincing at all.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.648
Yassa, boss, sounds great.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.149
Oh, wow.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.947
I hope you don't use that accent
when you open for me at the Garden.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.367
New York will not like that.
You fuck around, you get boo-ed.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.620
Boo-ed bad. They'll think
you're doing Kizzy from <i>Roots.</i>

16:36.704 --> 16:39.081
Or the lady from <i>The Help</i>.
I don't know what that was.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.709
Was that Grilla?
Is she doing Grilla right now?

16:41.792 --> 16:45.504
That's a hell of a way to say I'm sorry
when all you had to say was, "I'm sorry."

16:45.587 --> 16:46.463
You don't wanna do it?

16:46.547 --> 16:48.382
-I didn't say that.
-Did you say you did?

16:48.465 --> 16:50.426
-I haven't said anything.
-Take your time.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.760
-Think about it.
-Billie!

16:51.844 --> 16:54.555
While you do that,
let's talk about my opening five.

16:54.638 --> 16:58.267
What do we got? Where are we at?
Where can we go? What can we do?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.894
Okay, the last few days
have given you a lot of material.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.396
You got a lot to work with. Right?

17:02.479 --> 17:06.525
You got your brother,
you got your wife dating a sports god. Uh…

17:06.608 --> 17:08.819
Oh, your first movie
that's about to cross a billion,

17:08.902 --> 17:11.113
knowing half your points
are going to Monyca.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.282
What else you doing
that we don't know about? Huh?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.244
You in trouble or…
you on the run from the law?

17:21.248 --> 17:22.374
No.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.712
Yeah, what we have is fine.
That's enough. That's hard.

17:26.795 --> 17:30.215
That's the area we wanna be in.
Um, yeah, stay there, man.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.842
Fuck, I feel good.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.224
-Yo, what's up?
-<i>You forgot to call me back.</i>

17:39.308 --> 17:40.809
Uh, my bad. I got tied up.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.895
<i>We're not gonna talk about</i>
<i>the Shade Room thing?</i>

17:42.978 --> 17:45.439
Shade Room thing?
You talking about your date?

17:45.522 --> 17:48.567
Uh, no, I guess that's what happens
when you get divorced, right?

17:48.650 --> 17:49.860
<i>You're not mad?</i>

17:49.943 --> 17:52.654
No, I woke up this morning very grateful,

17:52.738 --> 17:56.575
appreciative for everything that I have,
I decided not to let anything bother me.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.952
<i>I'll take that. And I'm sorry.</i>

17:59.036 --> 18:01.580
<i>Hey, Christian may call you tomorrow.</i>
<i>He freaked out a bit.</i>

18:01.663 --> 18:03.582
<i>-I'll let him tell you.</i>
Tell me what?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.419
<i>-Well, he's mad at me. Very mad.</i>
-Tell him to call me in the morning.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.046
<i>-All right. Bye.</i>
All right. Bye.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.548
<i>Philly's music leader. MIX 95.6…</i>

18:11.632 --> 18:13.634
-<i>Kid, Kid, Kid.</i>

18:13.717 --> 18:16.512
First, <i>Anti-Verse </i>is fire!

18:16.595 --> 18:18.388
-Going across a billion.
-Yes, sir.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.892
Your first. How does that feel being
part of a movie that everybody's seen?

18:21.975 --> 18:24.144
Uh… I mean, amazing.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.521
It's a little unreal, man.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.857
I'm in a conversation now
with Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle

18:28.941 --> 18:30.776
about best Black superhero. Right?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.486
Uh… You can't write that.

18:32.569 --> 18:36.240
Now, is that the thing for you?
Big budget movies from here on out?

18:37.449 --> 18:41.328
I mean, I wouldn't say it's the thing.
It's not like I have one thing.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.622
But this is what
my fans are enjoying right now,

18:43.705 --> 18:46.291
and it makes me wanna give them
more of it. I'll say that.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.585
Well, since you brought up fans,

18:48.669 --> 18:51.588
you know you're trending
for giving old boy the business yesterday

18:51.672 --> 18:52.881
at the children's hospital.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.676
Word on the street is
he's one of your biggest.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.720
-I hear you can be hard to deal with.
-I can be hard to deal with?

18:58.804 --> 19:01.640
-That's just what I hear.
-Kinda sounds like you're hating.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.058
-A little bit.
-Me?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.852
-Yeah. A little bit. No?
-No, not at all.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.645
Maybe I'm reading into it wrong.

19:06.728 --> 19:07.604
Um…

19:07.688 --> 19:11.608
Look, to clear this up,
Gene <i>is</i> one of my biggest fans.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.027
In life, you make mistakes.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.905
I'm not perfect.
I've never claimed to be. Um…

19:16.989 --> 19:18.490
This was a mistake that was made

19:18.574 --> 19:20.909
and I might have to
walk it back and make it right.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.703
Fans can be hard to win back.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.706
I don't think they're hard to win back
if you don't mind humbling yourself,

19:25.789 --> 19:29.168
which I have no problem with. Um…
I got Gene coming to the show tonight.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.629
You know, he's coming backstage,
we'll hang out, we'll talk, we'll laugh.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.630
You should come.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.674
-You should actually come and hang out.
-Okay.

19:35.757 --> 19:36.967
Shoot.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.886
I don't think-- Do you have VIP passes?

19:40.596 --> 19:41.471
Okay.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.598
-Yeah.
-Real funny.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.122
I got this.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.281
-Here you go.
-Yeah, what's up?

20:42.491 --> 20:45.786
-All right
-So, about that money I owe you.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.537
Yeah, we'll get to that.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.041
We still haven't heard from Ari.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.585
Even though we've tried him many times.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.671
Hmm. That's strange.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.048
Usually he hollers back
when I reach out to him.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.883
You think he doesn't return our calls?

20:59.967 --> 21:02.886
Nikos, I'm not saying that, man.
I'm saying that, you know…

21:04.054 --> 21:06.640
maybe he's off somewhere
blowing off steam or something.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.768
No, that might be
how your people do things.

21:09.851 --> 21:13.105
Go off, get wasted,
curl up with your baby's mama.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.734
You fucking make your family worry,
but that's not how my people operate.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.905
Right. Right.
So you know how my people act, huh?

21:21.989 --> 21:24.741
And yet here you are,
asking <i>me</i> where <i>your</i> brother is.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.286
Hey, hey. Ease up, man. Ease up.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.163
Look, hurting me
ain't gonna help you find your brother.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.502
Hey, Ari hasn't called us,
and he knows better.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.091
Truth.

21:42.634 --> 21:47.389
Yo. Sometimes Ari dips when
he doesn't wanna be bothered by y'all.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.974
What the fuck is "dips"?

21:49.766 --> 21:52.102
Like, avoids. Both of youse.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.815
Why are we
talking with this asshole?

21:56.898 --> 21:58.317
Why are we still sitting here?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.652
Let's break his face,
remind him who we are.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.945
He knows who we are.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.488
Right? Carlton?

22:04.406 --> 22:05.490
You know who we are?

22:05.574 --> 22:06.783
Nikos, I'm just saying,

22:06.867 --> 22:08.994
your brother,
sometimes he feels like y'all

22:09.077 --> 22:10.787
don't see what he can bring to the table.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.915
You know,
that shit gets a little old, man.

22:13.999 --> 22:17.586
So, sometimes people get tired
of getting looked down on.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.173
People thinking they don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

22:21.673 --> 22:25.385
Yeah. Sometimes people
get fed up with that shit.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.054
They wanna bounce.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.140
You know what I'm talking about.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.268
Look, here's my advice.

22:33.352 --> 22:37.147
Instead of tearing up all Philly trying
to find your brother, just fall back.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.191
And, you know, when Ari shows up,

22:39.274 --> 22:41.902
then he can tell you
why he did what he did.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.946
Answer might surprise you.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.574
-Shit culture.
-Tell me about it.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.826
I told you
if Carlton knew something,

22:49.910 --> 22:51.745
he would tell us if we were face-to-face.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.746
Definitely.

22:53.372 --> 22:57.000
So, you're saying we treat Ari
the way your brother treats you?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.960
Ari said
he's a shitty fucking brother to you.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.879
-Hey.
-Hey what?

23:02.214 --> 23:03.632
-You torture Ari.
-Me?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.217
What the fuck are you talking about?

23:05.300 --> 23:07.302
You've been yelling at him his whole life.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.762
So, I'm gonna go ahead

23:08.845 --> 23:10.889
and let y'all work
this family shit out, all right?

23:12.516 --> 23:17.104
Carlton, we appreciate your honesty.
But we still expect our money, this week.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.106
Oh, oh, oh. About that.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.529
<i>Yo, look, you know who this is.</i>

23:25.612 --> 23:27.697
<i>Uh, quick video message</i>
<i>to let you guys know</i>

23:27.781 --> 23:30.450
<i>that I'm gonna go ahead</i>
<i>and pay Carlton's $600,000 debt.</i>

23:30.534 --> 23:32.536
<i>I'll wait for Monday morning,</i>
<i>the banks open,</i>

23:32.619 --> 23:34.037
<i>I'll wire you guys the money ASAP.</i>

23:34.121 --> 23:38.250
<i>Uh, this is a visual</i>
<i>and verbal contract between us.</i>

23:38.333 --> 23:39.709
<i>All debts will be paid.</i>

23:39.793 --> 23:42.337
Yeah. Okay, uh, we good?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.589
-We're good. We're good.

23:47.801 --> 23:48.844
Oh, Carlton.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.888
No transfer. Cash.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.640
Oh, make it happen.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.395
Yeah. You boys have a good time, man.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.527
Fuck.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.704
<i>Leave a message.</i>
<i>Don't forget, I write my own jokes.</i>

24:15.787 --> 24:17.414
I met with them cats tonight.

24:18.415 --> 24:22.377
They, uh, they want cash.
And they're not playing.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.965
Look, I'm gonna skip the concert tonight.
Talk to you tomorrow.

24:41.897 --> 24:45.650
So, I cannot stop thinking
about Kid's weird turnaround today.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.235
We were talking about that.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.613
What? First he offers me
Madison Square, weird,

24:49.696 --> 24:52.866
then he lets his wife off the hook
for being with her new dick in public.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.744
And then he tells Hersch
he's grateful. "Grateful."

24:55.827 --> 24:56.786
What is that?

24:56.870 --> 24:59.164
-Did he find Jesus? I'm serious.

24:59.247 --> 25:03.293
Or what? Is he like Ebenezer Scrooge,
he just woke up from some badass dream?

25:03.376 --> 25:06.755
You know what he is?
He's happy. He's killing it on stage.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.133
Can you grab him?

25:11.635 --> 25:13.094
-You gonna run these jokes now?
-Yeah.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.304
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.934
Billie, I didn't tell him
about the Will Ferrell thing,

25:19.017 --> 25:21.603
so this Madison Square thing is genuine.

25:21.686 --> 25:25.899
Question is, are you ready
to do the thing you've been dying to do

25:25.982 --> 25:27.984
since we found your ass on YouTube?

25:28.068 --> 25:30.445
-I mean, I don't know. To be honest.
-You don't know?

25:30.529 --> 25:33.365
Yeah. It's been a minute
since I did a set, first of all.

25:33.448 --> 25:37.285
-So I don't know if I have the material.
-Maybe you should find the material.

25:37.827 --> 25:41.248
'Cause if you say no to this,
20 years from now,

25:41.331 --> 25:44.000
right before you pass out drunk
in some gross bar,

25:44.084 --> 25:47.420
you're gonna think,
"Oh, my God, I could have gotten on stage

25:47.504 --> 25:50.298
at Madison Square fucking Garden

25:50.382 --> 25:53.301
and done all the jokes
you're pissed at him for not doing."

25:53.802 --> 25:57.347
Come on. Say yes.
Time for the star to shine.

25:57.430 --> 25:58.932
I'll think about it. Don't touch me.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.434
All right.
Hey, man, time for the star to shine!

26:01.518 --> 26:04.145
Dude, what a great
group of people, all of them.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.647
-Seriously. Yeah.
-Yeah?

26:05.730 --> 26:06.815
You're so fucked.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.943
All right. Come on. Let's get one in.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.152
Uh…

26:11.236 --> 26:13.280
Dear Heavenly Father,
I come to You and, uh…

26:13.863 --> 26:16.866
I guess I wanna say thank you,
thank you for all that you've given

26:16.950 --> 26:20.203
and… and allowed us to do
on this amazing journey we've been on.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.162
Um…

26:21.246 --> 26:25.083
I know I don't talk to You as much
as I possibly should. I'll do better.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.586
Thank you for the ability
to make people laugh.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.964
I ask that You let this audience tonight
receive these jokes

26:31.047 --> 26:34.175
and laugh as hard as they possibly can.
In Your name we pray.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.510
-Amen!
-Amen.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.845
-All right. You good?
-Yes.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.388
-I'll be outside.
-Let's get it.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.056
Be right out. Right out. Um…

26:40.140 --> 26:42.183
Hey, um, just wanted to double check.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.811
Haven't heard you
get your prayer on like that in a while.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.646
-Need anything? You good?
-I'm good.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.065
-I'm good.
-Have a great show.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.066
Come on.

26:51.693 --> 26:52.652
Yo, Kid!

26:53.153 --> 26:55.572
There he is. What up?

26:55.655 --> 26:59.117
Whoa, whoa, okay, Axel Foley.
Calm down, we're friends. It's Will.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.911
From the plane.
I loaned you my cell phone charger.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.456
-Yeah.
-And you kept it.

27:04.539 --> 27:05.874
My company has a suite here,

27:05.957 --> 27:08.710
I was telling my boss about
how we were chopping it up on the plane.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.338
I'm about to go on stage,
maybe after I'm done, we can finish.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.883
-Sure. First, this is Shelly.
-Hey, Kid. Great to meet you.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.385
Since you're in town,
our company would like to have you

27:17.469 --> 27:19.554
at our fundraising gala
for charity this week.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.307
If you're free,
15, 20 minutes tops. That's it.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.560
I would love to talk more.
I gotta get on stage, maybe after that.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.438
Last year we had Kenan Thompson.
I mean, he was fantastic.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.607
But if we could get you,
it'd be fantastic.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.485
-Talk to Todd.
-We're gonna take you over to the VIP.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.362
Gene! Talk to them.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.489
Gene! Hey!

27:41.034 --> 27:44.329
This is exactly how I pictured
backstage would be.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.747
It's cool, right?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.167
I just passed by Mario Lopez.

27:50.877 --> 27:53.672
That's not the biggest star
you're gonna see tonight, I promise.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.591
Duh. Who's bigger than you, right?

27:56.675 --> 27:59.719
-Oh, come on, Gene. Stop it.
-One-minute warning.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.347
-Thank you.
-But we still need to have that talk.

28:02.430 --> 28:05.016
No, man. No. We don't. That's over.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.769
Let's put that behind us.
That's water off a duck's ass.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.105
We don't ever
have to talk about that again.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.607
No, no, no. This isn't about the hospital.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.401
It's about last night.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.153
-What about last night?
-I saw you at the park.

28:17.821 --> 28:18.655
What?

28:21.241 --> 28:23.910
-I followed you last night.
-Thirty seconds, Kid.

28:25.078 --> 28:29.124
I felt so bad
with you being angry with me

28:29.749 --> 28:32.919
that I desperately wanted
to tell you how sorry I was.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.295
Why would you follow me?

28:34.379 --> 28:37.215
I couldn't tell you because, um…

28:38.174 --> 28:39.300
you were occupied.

28:42.512 --> 28:43.888
Dumping that body.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.394
-I have footage of the whole thing, but--
-Wait, Gene.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.604
What did you just say?

28:51.688 --> 28:54.107
I have footage of the whole thing,
but I figured…

28:54.190 --> 28:56.151
-Lower your voice. Lower…
-You're up, superstar.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.070
If I showed you footage of the kids,
you'd know I wasn't lying.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.031
-Listen to me. Why would you follow?
-Gene, he's gotta go.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.534
Come on into the VIP.
You're up. Here we go.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.162
-We can talk about it after.
-After the show. Let's go.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.538
Coming to the stage,

29:08.621 --> 29:11.040
the motherfucker
you've been waiting for all night!

29:12.834 --> 29:13.877
Grilla had a good set.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.129
They're warm
and ready for you to slay them.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.006
You good?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.802
Gonna be a good one. Have fun.

29:23.511 --> 29:28.933
Ladies and gentlemen, make noise!

30:04.427 --> 30:05.804
Billie in the house!

30:07.931 --> 30:09.390
We love you, Kid!

30:27.450 --> 30:28.284
Fuck.
