00:01.002 --> 00:02.462
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.671 --> 00:03.463
Major is a zombie.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.131
I'm a zombie, too.

00:05.340 --> 00:07.509
Those 322 people
are suspected zombies.

00:07.717 --> 00:09.678
- Kill them?
- I'm a fan of
submarine movies.

00:09.886 --> 00:11.596
Cut to the sailor
who receives that order

00:11.805 --> 00:14.391
closing that hatch
on his comrades.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.935
The man that closes that
hatch is a hero, isn't he?

00:17.143 --> 00:18.019
If this doesn't work...

00:18.228 --> 00:19.562
If the cure doesn't happen...

00:19.771 --> 00:21.189
- It's going to.
- But if it doesn't...

00:21.398 --> 00:23.483
I don't want to come back
as a zombie.

00:23.692 --> 00:27.529
A private military contractor
buying out my little energy
drink business.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.823
<i>Your factories,
labs, all of it.</i>

00:31.282 --> 00:32.283
<i>Drake's alive.</i>

00:32.492 --> 00:33.952
I just saw your zombies.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.120
They're all alive!

00:38.790 --> 00:40.458
It's cool you're letting
Ravi and me stay here.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.460
I drove by my place,

00:42.669 --> 00:44.921
my front yard is still
occupied by reporters
and looky-loos.

00:45.130 --> 00:48.258
I know you're still rolling
on drummer brain, but you
need to switch to this.

00:48.466 --> 00:49.384
Janko brain.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.137
Vaughn sent Janko to kill me.

00:52.345 --> 00:54.723
It's pretty clear he wants
both of us eliminated.

00:54.931 --> 00:56.850
We need to stay alive
long enough to rescue Drake

00:57.058 --> 01:00.437
and the rest of your
kidnapped zombies
from Vaughn's basement.

01:00.645 --> 01:03.773
Our best chance is
you joining me on this
soldier-for-hire brain.

01:03.982 --> 01:06.067
I know. Look, we need
to get 'em all out.

01:06.276 --> 01:09.070
All right. I promised
our district attorney
he'd see his kid again.

01:09.279 --> 01:10.530
And there was this woman,

01:10.739 --> 01:12.407
Natalie.

01:12.615 --> 01:17.162
I promised her I'd be
the first thing she saw
when she defrosted.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.999
I can't believe that murdering
little troll is just going to
get away with everything.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.835
Well, let's hope karma
bites Mr. Boss in the arse.

01:24.044 --> 01:25.587
What's up?

01:25.795 --> 01:28.173
The Mayor officially shut down
the Mr. Boss task force,

01:28.381 --> 01:31.342
what with my star witness,
Blaine, losing his memory.

01:31.551 --> 01:33.428
And you know
that smug son of a bitch

01:33.636 --> 01:35.597
is going to take
this as a sign that he can
do whatever he wants.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.640
Uh, Blaine or Mr. Boss?

01:41.352 --> 01:42.896
Eggs?

01:43.104 --> 01:45.356
Seriously, could anyone be
having a worse day than me?

01:46.566 --> 01:48.276
Hey. It's me again.

01:48.443 --> 01:50.737
I have a feeling
you're not listening
to these messages,

01:50.945 --> 01:53.740
but I'm really hoping we can
get together and talk, Dale.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.451
I wish you could trust
I had a good reason
to do what I did.

01:58.495 --> 01:59.662
Please call me back.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.165
I miss you.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.088
Here it is, boys.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.965
The Great Northern Railway's
premiere passenger train,

02:11.174 --> 02:12.300
the Empire Builder.

02:12.509 --> 02:13.927
When this baby's
whistle blows,

02:14.135 --> 02:15.762
I might, too.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.055
We've got some news, boss.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.139
Did you find my boy Drake?

02:18.348 --> 02:20.100
No, but we did find this.

02:21.392 --> 02:22.519
Lucky U.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.022
Got a bunch of it
flooding the streets.

02:26.231 --> 02:27.690
I thought we closed
that spigot when we
took care of Blaine.

02:27.899 --> 02:29.234
Where did it come from?

02:29.442 --> 02:31.194
Shaved-head punk is Don E.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.113
Giant with the eye patch,
he's new.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.115
- So, these two have
taken over Blaine's business?
- Yeah.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.199
I want them dead.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.826
Extra bloody.

02:38.034 --> 02:38.952
You sure?

02:39.160 --> 02:41.412
- So soon...
- I won, Kenny.

02:41.621 --> 02:44.499
Seattle threw in the towel.
I own this city.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.000
So, let's take our
victory lap.

02:49.712 --> 02:50.964
How are you feeling?

02:52.924 --> 02:55.510
Like I let an entire
city full of people down.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.554
I was contemplating
going door to door

02:57.762 --> 03:00.098
handing out
"sorry I suck so bad"
gift baskets...

03:00.306 --> 03:01.933
Hey. You're being
too hard on yourself.

03:02.142 --> 03:03.768
Mmm. I'm not.

03:03.977 --> 03:05.520
Trust me.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.856
I couldn't build a case
against Mr. Boss.
That's on me.

03:08.064 --> 03:09.399
You did your best.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.317
This is kind of
a "results matter" situation,

03:11.526 --> 03:12.777
and my best wasn't
good enough.

03:12.986 --> 03:15.572
Maybe you're too good.
Of a person, in general.

03:15.780 --> 03:19.409
I'm something of
an expert on the whole
"nice guys finish last" thing.

03:19.617 --> 03:22.996
- Mmm.
- Personally, I've been
toying with the idea of, uh,

03:23.204 --> 03:24.289
becoming a bad boy.

03:24.497 --> 03:25.623
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

03:25.832 --> 03:27.375
Start banging
my mates' girlfriends,

03:27.584 --> 03:29.669
get into strip club fights,

03:29.878 --> 03:31.212
tip a few cows.

03:31.421 --> 03:32.964
I can't imagine you
doing any of that.

03:33.173 --> 03:35.425
Well, you can't imagine
good Ravi cow tipping,

03:35.633 --> 03:37.594
but bad Ravi?

03:37.802 --> 03:39.971
He'll knock a broad-arse
bovine on her side
without a second thought.

03:40.180 --> 03:43.183
I don't buy into the whole
"nice guys finish last" thing.

03:48.021 --> 03:49.564
What the hell?

03:49.772 --> 03:50.940
"Can you believe the news?

03:51.149 --> 03:52.400
"Tell me you have
stock options, too.

03:52.609 --> 03:54.110
"See you at the company
party tomorrow."

03:54.319 --> 03:55.945
Who's that from?

03:56.154 --> 03:58.573
Dr. Wyatt Tomlin.
One of the younger guys
I train at Max Rager.

03:58.781 --> 04:02.243
A party could
be the perfect opportunity
to sneak into the basement.

04:03.703 --> 04:05.288
Um... Company.

04:06.748 --> 04:08.458
Oh. Hey.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.001
- Hi.
- 'Sup?

04:14.339 --> 04:16.758
Okay, good night.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.640
I'm guessing we
won't be needing
this inflatable mattress.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.817
It would've been so sweet
if the DA's office

04:35.026 --> 04:36.361
had been able
to nail Mr. Boss.

04:36.569 --> 04:38.947
Life would be all like...

04:41.532 --> 04:43.826
Instead it's all
Ken Burns <i>Civil War-</i>y...

04:48.706 --> 04:50.458
We have to start
watching our asses.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.419
Where the ha-zell is
Blaine with my Thai food?

04:55.296 --> 04:56.422
The rice man cometh.

04:57.507 --> 04:59.550
Go give him a hand, Chief.

04:59.759 --> 05:03.012
Loony bastard probably
can't remember how to
untie plastic to-go bags.

05:16.693 --> 05:18.486
Oh, damn!

05:20.238 --> 05:21.823
Don't kill me! Please!

05:21.990 --> 05:23.866
You want money?
I'll give you
whatever you want.

05:24.075 --> 05:26.286
Can you spring all
of my buddies from jail?

05:26.494 --> 05:29.080
The ones doing time, thanks
to your old boss and the
District Attorney's office.

05:29.289 --> 05:30.748
That's all on Blaine, man.

05:30.957 --> 05:32.500
He started out trying
to mess with Mr. Boss.

05:32.709 --> 05:33.918
After a while,
I think all he wanted

05:34.127 --> 05:36.963
was to keep knocking
boots with that hot DA.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.174
- It's love, man.
It makes you dopey.
- Now Blaine's dead,

05:40.341 --> 05:42.969
and somehow Lucky U
is back on the streets.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.762
And I'm guessing

05:44.971 --> 05:47.473
that he's not the brains
behind the operation.
Which leaves...

05:47.682 --> 05:48.641
Me?

05:48.850 --> 05:50.810
I'm a glorified gopher.
I'm no one.

05:51.019 --> 05:52.061
Blaine's still running things.

05:53.855 --> 05:55.189
Don't lie to me, boy.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.607
I was there the night
Blaine met his maker.

05:56.816 --> 05:58.943
Dude! He's still kicking.

05:59.152 --> 06:01.070
- He's coming here,
right now with Thai...

06:05.992 --> 06:07.118
Go!

06:07.327 --> 06:08.619
See?

06:08.828 --> 06:10.038
See how valuable I am?

06:10.246 --> 06:11.622
Your guy's never
going to catch him.

06:11.831 --> 06:14.125
- I know Blaine...
- Shut up. You're both dead.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.462
Okay! Okay!

06:17.670 --> 06:19.839
Just make it quick.
One to the head, bam,
like Chief there.

06:20.048 --> 06:24.052
No throat-slitting,
gut shot nonsense.
I can't handle pain, man.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.096
Are your fricking
hands shaking?

06:29.057 --> 06:31.267
Damn, son.

06:31.476 --> 06:33.728
- My hand's not shaking!
- Aw, man. Just move close.
It'll make it easier to aim.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.439
What? Mr. Boss
couldn't send a pro?
Am I your first?

06:43.529 --> 06:44.947
I hope it hurts.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.793
Hand to God.
Blaine's really alive.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.753
- He showed up
at the funeral home.
- That's the truth, boss.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.630
We slit his throat.
How in the hell
could he be alive?

07:00.838 --> 07:02.548
Maybe it was
a miracle or something?

07:02.757 --> 07:04.467
A miracle?

07:04.675 --> 07:07.845
The only miracle is that
I'm not asking Kenny
to shoot you right now.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.681
I want Blaine dead.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.433
Dead, dead.

07:12.642 --> 07:14.310
And when it's done,
cut his head off,

07:14.519 --> 07:16.312
bring it to me in a hat box.

07:16.521 --> 07:17.814
This is Seattle,

07:18.022 --> 07:19.065
not Sleepy Hollow.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.235
I'm still processing zombies,

07:22.443 --> 07:24.737
and now you're
giving me secret labs?

07:24.946 --> 07:27.323
Are all the zombies being
dangled over a shark tank?

07:27.532 --> 07:29.283
It is a good deal to digest.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.870
Hey. Dr. Wyatt finally
returned my text.

07:34.747 --> 07:35.706
Clive...

07:37.750 --> 07:41.587
I never got to thank you
for everything you did
to get me out of jail.

07:41.796 --> 07:45.007
- You saved me.
- It had a bit more to do with
the future of the species.

07:45.216 --> 07:46.175
Still.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.180
Be like Private Ryan.

07:51.389 --> 07:52.598
Earn this.

07:52.807 --> 07:54.600
That's the plan.

07:54.809 --> 07:57.145
So, it turns out the party
at Max Rager tonight
is a lock-in,

07:57.353 --> 07:58.521
down in their
underground parking lot.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.731
Prison-themed.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.942
Because of their new
Super Max drink.

08:03.151 --> 08:04.569
A prison theme?

08:05.570 --> 08:07.238
White people.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.365
So, the party starts
at 8:00 p.m.,
but by 10:00 p.m.,

08:09.574 --> 08:11.492
the gates will be locked,
and no one will be
allowed in or out.

08:11.701 --> 08:13.619
That's a pretty tight window
to make something happen.

08:13.828 --> 08:15.121
And by "make something
happen," you mean...

08:15.329 --> 08:16.789
We're going to break
into Max Rager

08:16.998 --> 08:18.666
and free Drake and the other
zombies in the basement.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.294
The biggest hurdle
is the elevator doesn't
go all the way down

08:21.502 --> 08:23.379
without the handprint
of someone with authorization.

08:24.172 --> 08:26.215
I have an idea.

08:26.424 --> 08:28.926
So, what? You plan on
<i>Weekend At Bernie's-</i>ing

08:29.135 --> 08:31.137
a dead Janko
through the halls
of Max Rager?

08:31.345 --> 08:33.764
- Of course not.
- We'll just take his hand.

08:33.973 --> 08:36.934
You're going to cut off
a dead man's hand and use
it to open an elevator?

08:37.143 --> 08:38.978
I think it's Janko's
mercenary brain that's
making them think

08:39.187 --> 08:40.354
this is a reasonable idea.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.315
I guess it is kind of grisly.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.691
I'm not hearing other ideas.

08:49.906 --> 08:51.657
Maybe Dr. Wyatt?

08:51.866 --> 08:54.160
- Who?
- One of the doctors who
works in the basement lab.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.703
Young guy. I train him.

08:55.912 --> 08:57.580
He likes me and I've heard
him say some things

08:57.788 --> 08:59.790
that make me think
he might be sympathetic
to the zombie cause.

08:59.999 --> 09:01.709
Maybe I can talk him
into letting us downstairs.

09:01.918 --> 09:03.169
If everything goes right,
we could be in by the time

09:03.377 --> 09:05.004
the party starts
and out before lock-down.

09:05.213 --> 09:06.672
Even if this guy lets
you in the basement,

09:06.881 --> 09:08.549
what do you do when
you find the zombies?

09:08.758 --> 09:10.593
I mean, how you gonna
get out of the building?

09:10.801 --> 09:13.429
We'll have 20 nearly
invulnerable zombies.
We'll figure it out.

09:13.638 --> 09:15.556
- No warrant.
- We don't plan
on arresting anyone.

09:15.765 --> 09:17.183
And if someone
gets in the way?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.352
Then things will likely go
south for that someone.

09:20.603 --> 09:21.771
They have Drake.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.690
I can't help you with this.

09:24.899 --> 09:25.942
I would never expect you to.

09:27.068 --> 09:29.445
This is a zombie thing.

09:29.654 --> 09:32.323
Are you sure this Dr. Wyatt
is even someone
you can count on?

09:33.658 --> 09:35.868
Well...

09:36.077 --> 09:38.371
Vlad, look what I found
in the back of that metal
cabinet in the storage room.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.415
It's genuine Utopium, boy!

09:41.624 --> 09:44.544
It's the real thing.
First stock options,
now free drugs?

09:44.752 --> 09:47.213
Who knew this evil
underground lair gig
would have actual perks?

09:47.421 --> 09:50.299
Wyatt, that's all the stuff
they pulled from the pockets
of the party boat zombies.

09:50.508 --> 09:51.759
- Yeah?
- Put it back.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.098
Young scientists!

09:57.265 --> 09:59.183
Vamoose!
I need a moment alone
with my little girl.

10:03.563 --> 10:04.772
The papers are all signed.

10:04.981 --> 10:07.567
As of midnight tomorrow,
the company, all of it,

10:07.775 --> 10:11.070
will belong to
Fillmore-Graves Enterprises.

10:11.279 --> 10:12.530
And they are?

10:12.738 --> 10:13.906
Uh, they're a private
military contractor.

10:14.115 --> 10:17.743
Think Blackwater,
but less cuddly.

10:17.952 --> 10:21.581
The company is selling
for more money than
I could ever spend

10:21.789 --> 10:24.083
over multiple lifetimes.

10:24.292 --> 10:27.503
And now, with all these
zombie guinea pigs,
finding a cure for you

10:27.712 --> 10:29.505
will have my full attention.

10:30.548 --> 10:31.591
Wow.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.386
You're doing all this for me?

10:36.095 --> 10:37.722
Yeah, I am.

10:37.930 --> 10:41.517
Yet you couldn't
hold an elevator door
open for three seconds.

10:41.726 --> 10:45.605
You really need
to move past this, Rita.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.734
Grudges are like
poison for the... The chi.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.612
I promise you, one day,
years from now,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.322
we're gonna be sipping
limoncello on the patio

10:54.530 --> 10:56.449
of my new Lake Como estate,

10:56.657 --> 10:58.075
watching your kids

10:58.284 --> 11:00.786
run around, assuming you
can still have kids...

11:00.995 --> 11:02.955
Whatever, maybe they'll
be adopted. Who cares?

11:03.164 --> 11:04.749
Anyway, limoncello,

11:04.957 --> 11:07.043
frolicking kids and...

11:07.251 --> 11:08.502
We're gonna lock eyes

11:08.711 --> 11:10.755
across a sundrenched patio

11:10.963 --> 11:12.173
and we'll think,

11:12.340 --> 11:14.133
"Remember

11:14.342 --> 11:18.387
"that whole crazy
secret basement thing?

11:21.641 --> 11:23.601
"Oh, how far we've come."

11:23.809 --> 11:25.936
Any progress
on the guinea pigs?

11:28.606 --> 11:30.441
I'm never going
to see my son again.

11:30.650 --> 11:32.360
Hey.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.528
You gotta try to calm down
a little bit, buddy,
all right?

11:34.737 --> 11:36.072
We're gonna find
a way out of this.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.366
He thinks I killed myself.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.784
He's never gonna get over it.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.206
What the hell?

11:47.166 --> 11:48.501
That's the guy
they took yesterday.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.130
What did they do to him?

11:53.339 --> 11:56.634
Now, which one of you freaks
wants to try cure version
number three, huh?

11:57.843 --> 12:01.222
Eeny, meeny, miny...

12:01.430 --> 12:03.099
Whoa!

12:03.307 --> 12:04.642
Three's my lucky number.

12:05.476 --> 12:06.394
Look at you.

12:06.602 --> 12:07.812
The brave one.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.980
Why don't you
put the cattle prod down?

12:10.189 --> 12:11.357
We can have a brave-off.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.610
Yeah, that's what I thought.

12:14.819 --> 12:15.736
Get down on your knees.

12:20.491 --> 12:21.826
Door!

12:25.037 --> 12:25.996
Come on. Let's go.

12:34.714 --> 12:36.006
<i>Listen up, cater waiters.</i>

12:36.215 --> 12:38.384
We're low on the
bacon-wrapped
release steaks,

12:38.592 --> 12:40.136
so push the
shank steak crostini

12:40.344 --> 12:42.304
and the shish kebab.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.099
No sign of your
buddy, Dr. Wyatt, and
we're almost out of time.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.726
I don't know
where he could be.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.520
Let's take another lap.

12:49.729 --> 12:53.232
<i>Attention. Lock-down will
begin in three minutes.</i>

12:53.441 --> 12:55.359
What should we do?

12:55.568 --> 12:57.445
We're inside now.
We see this through.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.363
You know anyone else
who works in the lab?

13:01.240 --> 13:03.576
Twelve o'clock,
plaid shirt, tats.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.162
I'm pretty sure he's
one of their basement guys.
I've seen him with Wyatt.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.455
He's a total dick in the gym.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.248
I doubt he'd help us.

13:09.457 --> 13:11.208
We should've
taken the damn hand.

13:21.719 --> 13:23.345
Hey.
<i>You've reached Liv's phone.
Leave a message.</i>

13:23.554 --> 13:24.847
It's after 10:00.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.849
You were gonna call me
when you made it out.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.017
Call me.

13:38.611 --> 13:40.362
I'm sorry, Detective.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.490
There is no circumstance
under which I can let
you into this party...

13:42.698 --> 13:44.158
Sir.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.786
They've taken this
prison theme pretty far,
haven't they?

13:46.994 --> 13:50.623
You see, unlike you,
I'm not pretending
to be law enforcement.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.416
I need to speak with
Mr. Du Clark right now.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.044
Not gonna happen.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.963
Mr. Du Clark's taken
every precaution
to make this a truly

13:58.172 --> 13:59.465
private party.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.425
The gate is on
a timed release.

14:01.634 --> 14:03.636
I couldn't open
it even if I wanted to.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.347
Hey, man.
We need to get in.
Our set's about to start.

14:07.473 --> 14:10.100
Uh, right, Mr. Thomas.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.186
You are very much

14:12.394 --> 14:13.687
on the list.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.106
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

14:19.652 --> 14:20.778
I'm with the band.

14:22.530 --> 14:23.906
Look, man,

14:24.114 --> 14:26.200
you cannot tell Mr. Du Clark
that I let you in.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.118
I'm begging you.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.954
Say it was Rob Thomas.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.997
You cannot believe the crap
that guy gets away with.

14:42.091 --> 14:44.718
Hello?

14:44.927 --> 14:48.389
With everything that's
going on, I have no
business feeling this happy,

14:48.597 --> 14:50.015
yet, here I am, feeling...

14:51.934 --> 14:53.060
Nauseous.

14:53.269 --> 14:55.646
All this food
and nothing to eat.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.942
So, guess who's
coming to dinner.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.869
It's insane
to let him stay here.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.787
He showed up here
afraid for his life.

15:11.996 --> 15:14.415
Mr. Boss sent
hit men to Shady Plots.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.250
You're making
my case for me.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.710
Think about what
it means if something
happens to Blaine.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.211
We still don't know who
his brain clients are.

15:19.420 --> 15:20.796
He dies, they don't get fed.

15:21.005 --> 15:22.590
It's just one night.
I'm working on a safe house.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.051
Can we at least lock
him in the hall closet?

15:26.635 --> 15:27.720
Blaine?

15:33.225 --> 15:35.227
"Peyton, went to find
some food.

15:35.436 --> 15:39.106
"Text me once you've
reached a verdict on
whether or not I can stay."

15:39.273 --> 15:41.609
I'm sure
he'll be back in a minute.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.660
- Major?
- Uh, Art History.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.078
Which is why I'm doing this.

15:56.582 --> 15:57.625
There's Wyatt.

15:57.833 --> 15:58.792
Ten o'clock.

16:01.337 --> 16:02.296
He's on the move.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.926
At first, it was just
a collection of thoughts,

16:07.134 --> 16:08.552
then I realized,
this is a book...

16:08.761 --> 16:11.388
Ah, cocktails!

16:11.597 --> 16:12.556
Perfect timing.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.516
Cellblock Mango,

16:14.725 --> 16:16.101
or Convicted Melon?

16:16.310 --> 16:17.603
Which would you prefer, Viv?

16:18.270 --> 16:19.688
...vian.

16:19.897 --> 16:22.316
I only drink liquor
that comes out of a barrel.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.901
The way God intended.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.322
Double-fisted it is, then.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.367
So tell me about all
the cool stuff your
mercenaries will be doing

16:31.575 --> 16:33.661
when you pump 'em
full of Super Max.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.537
They gonna be dodging bullets

16:35.746 --> 16:37.289
Keanu Reeves-style, huh?

16:37.498 --> 16:40.459
You know, the thing about
private military contractors

16:40.668 --> 16:43.295
is that they love gabbing
with strangers about
what they do.

16:43.504 --> 16:47.299
So, I've noticed you
have a lot of undercover
security here tonight.

16:47.508 --> 16:50.886
- Do I?
- Your fake prison guards
are packing real heat.

16:51.095 --> 16:53.055
Those side arms aren't props.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.557
- Do your parties tend
to get that out of hand?
- No.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.226
They never get out of hand.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.770
Always safe, never sorry.

16:59.979 --> 17:01.855
That's my mantra.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.607
Why isn't he texting me back?

17:03.816 --> 17:05.693
Well, maybe his battery died.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.028
Let's give it another
20 minutes and I'll go
out looking for him.

17:10.322 --> 17:11.573
See? It's gonna be fine.

17:19.123 --> 17:20.874
You know how many
of my buddies you've
put away, lady?

17:21.041 --> 17:22.584
I'd just as soon kill you,

17:22.793 --> 17:25.295
so you need to keep it down.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.882
If you know
where to find Blaine,

17:29.091 --> 17:31.844
you should tell him
Kenny has his piece of ass.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.680
I can see why Blaine would
want to keep nailing you.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.016
The second the police
become involved, she's dead.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.559
If we hear a siren,

17:38.767 --> 17:40.477
if we hear chatter
on the police band,

17:40.686 --> 17:43.689
if one of our many
sources in the SPD
gives us a heads up,

17:43.897 --> 17:45.566
she's done.

17:50.154 --> 17:53.032
<i>Who's ready to have

17:54.950 --> 17:58.370
<i>I cannot tell you how

17:58.579 --> 18:00.247
<i>His music is ripped</i>

18:00.456 --> 18:02.624

- For you.
- This is such a bad idea.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.828
Ah, yeah.

19:21.036 --> 19:22.162
That's happening.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.580
It's good.

19:23.789 --> 19:24.873
Excellent.

19:25.082 --> 19:26.583
Yes.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.585

What do you think?
Up or down?

19:51.024 --> 19:54.027
You didn't tell me the dude
from Matchbox Twenty would
be here. I might've come.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.737
I can't believe
you're here now.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.531
You were supposed
to be out by now.
I was worried.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.116
We saw Dr. Wyatt
head to the stairwell,

19:59.324 --> 20:00.617
but we're not sure
which direction he went.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.035
Let's start downstairs.

20:04.830 --> 20:09.126
Ah, Detective Babineaux...
And Daft Punk.

20:09.334 --> 20:13.922
See, normally, this would
be a great surprise, but I
really hate party crashers.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.883
If you're not invited,
just don't come.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.176
It's simple manners, really.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.846
Take 'em down.
Throw 'em in one of the cells.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.348
We'll use them for parts.

20:25.642 --> 20:26.977
All right. Turn around.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.318

21:41.176 --> 21:42.928
Just like the ones
at the boat party.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.808
Take this.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.226
I'll walk you
through how to use it.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.190
Let's rock and roll.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.986
Sorry, that's all
the firepower I've got.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.780
There's always
"In case of fire" power.

22:06.827 --> 22:09.288
Okay. If we run into more
of those red-eyed things,
we'll be ready.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.832
You need to aim for the head,
all right. That's the only
way to kill them.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.043
You should also probably
know that they're not
interested in the two of us.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.795
The only brains they want
are human ones.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.174
Shall we see
if that elevator takes
us out of here?

22:25.929 --> 22:27.222
Those people up there...

22:30.726 --> 22:32.019
Let's go see if they
need some help.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.745
Looks like the party's over.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.208
Everyone's dead.

22:56.668 --> 22:57.878
Or undead.

22:59.129 --> 23:00.297
Watch your backs.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.721
<i>Come on, dude.
Wake up.</i>

23:13.310 --> 23:16.063
Hey. What the hell happened?

23:16.271 --> 23:17.439
Where's our district attorney
friend?

23:23.111 --> 23:24.488
They took Peyton,

23:24.696 --> 23:26.031
and pistol whipped me.

23:26.239 --> 23:27.699
Mr. Boss' guys?

23:27.908 --> 23:29.409
They just want you.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.411
They figured you'll go
looking for Peyton.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.706
And why would Mr. Boss
think I'd endanger
myself to save her?

23:34.915 --> 23:37.751
Because, as I understand it,

23:37.959 --> 23:39.294
you were, uh,

23:40.754 --> 23:41.838
involved with her.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.257
How deeply?

23:44.466 --> 23:46.676
A merciful God
spared me the details.

23:47.552 --> 23:49.805
Damn, mate.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.682
As wickets go,
this one is hella sticky.

23:54.226 --> 23:55.477
What to do?

23:56.436 --> 23:57.938
Uh, poor Rob Thomas.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.481
This is how
a skull breaks.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.066
Hey.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.484
I think I found our
ticket to the basement.

24:11.785 --> 24:12.744
Heads up.

24:19.543 --> 24:22.504
A massive zombie outbreak
means never having
to say you're sorry.

24:24.756 --> 24:26.341
Survivors.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.143
Move! Move! Move!

24:40.730 --> 24:42.732
Clive! Get in here!
They're coming after you!

24:57.664 --> 24:58.748
Major! Come on!

25:06.673 --> 25:08.592
This is why I self-park.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.968
How many more rounds
of ammo do we have left?

25:10.177 --> 25:11.511
Not enough.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.846
Any signal?

25:18.226 --> 25:19.769
Poor guy.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.938
They must be trying to wipe
out your whole operation.

25:23.773 --> 25:25.150
There's more blood, over here.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.318
Looks like it leads out.

25:33.617 --> 25:35.452
Good lord.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.787
You seem a bit familiar
with how things work.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.414
What have you got for me?

25:39.623 --> 25:40.624
We've been over this.

25:40.832 --> 25:41.750
You're not coming.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.502
I am.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.420
Sorry. If I go out, it's going
to be in a blaze of glory,

25:45.629 --> 25:47.047
not by friendly fire.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.341
So you know,

25:49.549 --> 25:52.302
I'm squad leader on my
<i>Call of Duty</i> World League
Challenge Division team.

25:52.511 --> 25:53.678
I know what I'm doing.

25:56.598 --> 25:57.682
One.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.691
What's that?

26:06.900 --> 26:09.110
Don E. said it belonged
to the Chaos Killer.

26:09.319 --> 26:10.612
Not sure what they are.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.947
We should roll.

26:21.915 --> 26:24.417
These windows aren't
long for this world.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.758
Not the most efficient
use of our bullets.

26:31.967 --> 26:33.385
We've been breached.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.262
There's no way
to close this up.

26:35.470 --> 26:36.805
Look, more are gonna
find this way in.

26:37.013 --> 26:38.265
I've got six rounds left.

26:38.473 --> 26:39.724
I've got three,
but only two for them.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.519
No way I'm getting
eaten alive.

26:45.855 --> 26:46.815
There's another option.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.025
I could scratch you.

26:49.234 --> 26:50.110
You wanna turn me
into one of them?

26:50.318 --> 26:51.653
Not one of them.

26:51.861 --> 26:52.779
One of us.

27:00.996 --> 27:03.164
They're here.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.208
I can't believe they're
holding Peyton right here
at Mr. Boss headquarters.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.960
They want me to find them.

27:08.169 --> 27:09.754
Make sure the lights stay off.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.674
- I'm opening the door.
- We're going in? Now?

27:12.882 --> 27:15.510
I'm scouting around
back to see if there's
a better plan of attack.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.012
You won't go in without me,
right?

27:17.220 --> 27:19.097
I'm considering using you
as a human shield.

27:27.105 --> 27:28.273
Head in the game, boys.

27:28.481 --> 27:29.649
We're expecting company.

27:36.197 --> 27:37.324
What the hell, man?

27:37.532 --> 27:39.200
You moved her?

27:39.409 --> 27:40.827
- Freed up her feet?
- She said her legs
were going numb.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.213
Another 10 minutes,
she would've put this
through your temple.

28:00.597 --> 28:01.723
Come on, Blaine.

28:06.186 --> 28:07.896
Oh, no.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.439
Did you hear that?

28:44.349 --> 28:46.059
All right, Chinatown.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.769
I got your girlfriend here,

28:47.977 --> 28:48.978
and I'm walking out.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.751
It's okay, it's okay.

29:21.636 --> 29:24.973
Clive! That was my last round.

29:25.181 --> 29:28.977
We don't have enough
time or ammunition
to argue about this.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.895
I need to scratch you.

29:31.104 --> 29:33.982
I appreciate the offer,
but I think I'll stick
with my original plan.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.153
Get some!

29:42.282 --> 29:43.575
Come on!

29:43.783 --> 29:44.868
Get some!

29:46.244 --> 29:47.537
Who the hell is that?

29:53.168 --> 29:54.127
Uh...

29:55.044 --> 29:56.463
Thank you.

29:56.671 --> 29:58.506
Vivian Stoll,
Fillmore-Graves Enterprises.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.175
Clive Babineaux, Seattle PD.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.177
This is Liv Moore from
the Medical Examiner's office.

30:02.385 --> 30:03.344
You're gonna be a busy girl.

30:04.679 --> 30:05.805
Major Lilywhite.

30:06.681 --> 30:09.184
Personal trainer.

30:09.392 --> 30:13.730
Guess those reports
about Max Rager causing
manic episodes were true.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.565
Looks that way.

30:15.774 --> 30:17.692
We were out of ammo.
You got here
in the nick of time.

30:17.901 --> 30:19.486
I'm the new owner here.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.863
I'm starting
to think I overpaid.

30:22.071 --> 30:25.700
- We should go.
- We think there may be
more survivors down below.

30:25.909 --> 30:26.868
We're gonna check it out.

30:27.577 --> 30:28.536
Right.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.497
Okay. Well, good luck.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.457
I'm gonna head up
to the gate and call
for reinforcements.

30:32.665 --> 30:33.792
Take these.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.043
What about you?

30:35.835 --> 30:37.212
I'll be fine.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.713
You think you need both those?

30:44.928 --> 30:46.095
Here goes nothing.

30:50.475 --> 30:51.726
<i>Thank you,
Jeffrey Grunderson.</i>

30:51.935 --> 30:53.144
<i>Live to the Max.</i>

30:54.729 --> 30:56.314
Yeah, thanks, Jeffrey.

30:59.609 --> 31:02.779
Okay, zombie cells
are behind those doors.

31:02.987 --> 31:04.197
I'll try to get
some lights on.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.585
Holy mother of...

31:17.794 --> 31:19.128
What the hell are these?

31:19.337 --> 31:21.005
They're Romeros.

31:21.214 --> 31:23.591
This is what we'd become
if we didn't get any brains.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.718
Once you're this far gone,
there's no coming back.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.429
Hey, roomie.

31:28.638 --> 31:31.975
Well, if it isn't
the poster child
for poetic justice.

31:32.183 --> 31:34.102
Did someone have
a lab accident?

31:34.310 --> 31:36.521
I'm gonna guess,

31:36.729 --> 31:39.023
based on that dismembered
hand in your belt, that you
weren't invited down here.

31:39.232 --> 31:40.441
Bet I know what
you're looking for.

31:41.818 --> 31:43.111
Who you're looking for.

31:43.319 --> 31:44.362
Where are they?

31:45.280 --> 31:47.031
Hey, baby.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.451
I can access the control panel
to get you to your zombies.

31:50.660 --> 31:51.786
They're right through
that door.

31:55.957 --> 31:56.916
It's locked.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.669
Come on, guys.

32:01.838 --> 32:03.506
We're all on
the same side here.

32:03.715 --> 32:05.925
We all hate my dad.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.385
We all want
to survive the night.

32:07.594 --> 32:08.845
We've all seen Major naked.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.180
- I haven't seen...
- Do it, Major.

32:11.389 --> 32:13.808
She makes one false
move, I'll put a bullet
in her brain.

32:14.017 --> 32:15.935
That's the spirit!

32:16.144 --> 32:18.813
Just punch in 867-5309.

32:19.689 --> 32:20.648
What can I say?

32:20.857 --> 32:21.774
Dad loves the '80s.

32:26.404 --> 32:27.488
Nothing up my sleeves.

32:28.698 --> 32:30.533
Come here.
Open those doors.

32:32.660 --> 32:34.621
Sheesh. I mean,

32:34.829 --> 32:37.749
I've had bad break-ups before,
but really, Major?

32:38.416 --> 32:39.500
Go.

32:47.342 --> 32:49.510
- It's clear.
- Move.

32:49.719 --> 32:51.804
I'm guessing
no funny business?

32:51.971 --> 32:52.931
Go.

32:58.811 --> 33:01.522
Welcome to the after-party,
folks!

33:01.731 --> 33:03.524
Major? Can you hear me?

33:03.733 --> 33:06.152
Are we having fun yet?

33:06.361 --> 33:08.821
Save your breath.
It's solid steel.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.365
Looks like it's
just you and me.

33:11.699 --> 33:12.742
And them.

33:15.745 --> 33:17.163
Oh, my God.

33:17.372 --> 33:19.207
Drake?

33:19.415 --> 33:21.584
I recognize some
Chaos Killer victims.

33:21.793 --> 33:25.129
There's Tim Addis.
Floyd Baracus.

33:30.426 --> 33:31.386
Oh, damn.

33:41.646 --> 33:42.689
Drake.

33:49.612 --> 33:52.281
Drake. It's me. Liv.

33:52.490 --> 33:54.075
You remember me, don't you?

33:54.283 --> 33:55.535
Try to remember.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.205
Liv, we need to get these
others out of here.

33:59.414 --> 34:01.499
We can still save them.
It's why we're here.

34:01.708 --> 34:04.460
Just give me a minute, okay?

34:04.669 --> 34:08.089
Oh, Major.
It's such a shame you're not
seeing what I'm seeing.

34:08.297 --> 34:10.341
'Cause it's a whole Lifetime
movie playing out

34:10.550 --> 34:12.135
in the next room.

34:12.343 --> 34:13.803
Seems your gal

34:14.012 --> 34:15.805
had a zombie on the side.

34:16.014 --> 34:17.473
Good night, sweet zombie.

34:17.682 --> 34:18.850
Cue the strings.

34:23.312 --> 34:25.064
Yeah, I'm bored.

34:25.273 --> 34:28.609
Seems to me the key
demo here is men

34:28.818 --> 34:31.446
30 to 48.

34:31.654 --> 34:34.907
And our demo loves action,
don't we?

34:35.116 --> 34:38.077
- Vaughn, please don't.
- Action it is.

35:12.862 --> 35:13.988
Dead.

35:14.197 --> 35:15.698
Oh, man!
She shot him!

35:15.907 --> 35:17.241
Okay? Shot him dead!

35:18.201 --> 35:19.619
Well, more dead.

35:19.827 --> 35:21.871
A couple more deaths,

35:22.080 --> 35:23.623
we're gonna be able
to change this Lifetime
movie into a Greek tragedy.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.585
Hey. Wonder what
this button does.

35:34.717 --> 35:36.177
Liv, you smell that?

35:36.385 --> 35:37.553
It's some kind of gas.
We need to get out of here.

35:40.598 --> 35:42.475
You go.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.060
The stairs are back there
somewhere.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.312
Liv.

35:46.521 --> 35:49.440
Let the brain take over.
You're a soldier.
You've been trained for this.

35:51.567 --> 35:52.860
Uh-oh, honey.

35:53.069 --> 35:55.071
All our guinea pigs
are escaping,

35:55.279 --> 35:58.574
and with them,
your chances for a cure.

35:58.783 --> 36:00.743
Did you ever care about me?

36:00.952 --> 36:02.495
Do you hear yourself?

36:02.703 --> 36:04.580
Do you hear yourself?

36:04.789 --> 36:07.834
Making this moment about you!

36:08.042 --> 36:11.129
'Cause I'm the one
who stands to lose
a billion dollars tonight!

36:11.337 --> 36:12.839
Not to mention my reputation!

36:13.047 --> 36:14.841
One hundred dead employees,

36:15.049 --> 36:17.051
one dead Rob Thomas.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.428
I mean, this just looks bad.

36:19.637 --> 36:20.847
You think Twitter's
gonna be kind?

36:21.055 --> 36:24.767
- Vaughn, let us out!
- And you...

36:24.976 --> 36:28.271
You made a lot of bad
life choices, Major!

36:28.479 --> 36:31.107
You could've been
on my Gulfstream.

36:31.315 --> 36:34.777
Party stops
to Rio, Berlin, Ibiza...

36:34.986 --> 36:38.197
I bet you'd have made
a hell of a wingman.

36:38.406 --> 36:41.159
Nothing wrong with
my sloppy seconds.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.370
But no soup for you,
my friend.

36:44.579 --> 36:46.080
Whatever's happening up there,

36:46.289 --> 36:47.665
you're to blame!

36:49.000 --> 36:50.251
Dinner is served!

36:50.459 --> 36:51.878
Go get 'em, guys!

36:56.799 --> 36:57.800
What's the dealio?

36:58.634 --> 37:00.094
Will no one rid me

37:00.303 --> 37:03.514
of this meddlesome
Jason Priestly-type?

37:03.723 --> 37:05.474
Hey! Hey, dummies!

37:05.683 --> 37:06.809
There's your first course.

37:07.018 --> 37:08.895
Hot cross brains.
Right there!

37:12.315 --> 37:13.566
Oh...

37:14.609 --> 37:16.194
Snap.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.779
Yeah, I'm arguing
with a dead guy.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.992
<i>Et tu,</i> Major?

37:23.201 --> 37:26.162
Okay. This seems hardly
worth my time.
Tell you what.

37:29.957 --> 37:33.336
That gas should
de-animate you.

37:33.544 --> 37:35.671
Work in about
a minute or so.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.633
I'll come in after
you're out for the count,

37:38.841 --> 37:40.801
take that ax and put
everybody out of his misery.

37:41.010 --> 37:41.928
Sound like a plan?

38:01.280 --> 38:02.531
<i>- Unauthorized access.</i>
- Come on. Come on!

38:02.740 --> 38:04.116
Come on!

38:04.325 --> 38:06.244
- Ah!
<i>- Unauthorized access.</i>

38:08.788 --> 38:10.539
Here's Major!

38:10.748 --> 38:13.000
Okay, I can see you're upset.

38:17.129 --> 38:20.925
I would not go out there.
There are zombies
and poison gas. Ooh.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.219
And they're gonna be
in here any second.

38:30.643 --> 38:31.852
Ah!

38:33.229 --> 38:34.355
Hey!

38:38.526 --> 38:40.653
Help me! Help me, my friend.

38:40.861 --> 38:42.738
I know you're a fan
of submarine movies,

38:42.947 --> 38:44.865
- so I'm sure
you'll understand.
- No, no, no, no!

38:45.408 --> 38:47.201
No! Ah!

38:48.911 --> 38:49.870
Good luck.

38:50.746 --> 38:51.789
No!

38:52.873 --> 38:54.834
No!

38:55.042 --> 38:57.044
Major! Major!

38:57.253 --> 38:58.587
Help me!

38:58.796 --> 39:00.423
Help me!

39:00.631 --> 39:01.757
Ahhh!

39:04.010 --> 39:05.261
Use the clicker.

39:05.469 --> 39:07.221
Lock the door behind me.
We'll be right back.

39:09.807 --> 39:11.225
What do you think
we're gonna find down there?

39:11.434 --> 39:12.768
No idea.

39:12.977 --> 39:14.812
- Got any ammo?
- Uh-uh.

39:18.774 --> 39:19.775
Here.

39:38.336 --> 39:39.628
I'm so sorry about Drake.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.092
I killed him.

39:45.301 --> 39:47.053
He was already gone, Liv.
That wasn't him.

39:47.261 --> 39:48.679
Are there any other survivors?

39:48.888 --> 39:50.097
They're in Vaughn's office.

39:52.475 --> 39:54.518
I have to call this in.

39:54.727 --> 39:57.563
Even though I have no idea
how any of this is gonna
get explained away.

39:57.772 --> 40:00.524
Super Max.
It created a violent
chain reaction.

40:00.733 --> 40:04.487
Armed guards lost their heads
and began firing on
rampaging employees.

40:04.695 --> 40:06.280
You really think
that's gonna fly?

40:06.489 --> 40:08.240
You think "zombie outbreak"
has a better chance?

40:10.326 --> 40:13.412
Her name is Natalie.
She has dark hair.
She's about 5'6".

40:13.621 --> 40:15.247
She's pretty.
About 30 years old.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.249
I recognize you.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.793
I just hired you to train me.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.962
You were in the elevator
the day I got kidnapped.

40:22.963 --> 40:24.632
You're that guy.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.175
I remember him, too.

40:26.384 --> 40:28.010
Yeah, I saw Natalie.

40:28.219 --> 40:29.303
Where was she?

40:29.512 --> 40:30.679
This tattooed guard
led her away.

40:30.888 --> 40:31.806
They never brought her back.

40:33.849 --> 40:35.726
No, every ambulance you have.

40:35.935 --> 40:38.354
However many can be sent,
that's how many you need
to get here.

40:38.562 --> 40:40.231
Hurry.

40:40.439 --> 40:42.942
Those zombies in there
can't be seen by
normal doctors.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.652
They have almost no pulse.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.195
Doctors will figure out
there's something
wrong with them.

40:46.404 --> 40:48.489
You. Identify yourself.

40:49.198 --> 40:50.741
Seattle PD.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.368
Who the hell are you?

40:52.576 --> 40:54.370
We're the people here
to kick ass and take names.

40:54.578 --> 40:56.789
- Any more survivors?
- There's a whole
bunch in here.

40:56.997 --> 40:58.290
- Load 'em up.
- Wait a minute.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.667
You see this badge?

40:59.875 --> 41:01.585
I take my orders
from Vivian Stoll.

41:01.794 --> 41:04.088
- Where's your boss now?
- She's securing
the parking garage.

41:06.132 --> 41:07.550
Hold down the fort.

41:07.758 --> 41:09.009
I'll be safe down there.

41:09.218 --> 41:11.053
- Hurry back.
- I think I'll take the stairs.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.350
<i>♪ I'm not crazy</i>

41:16.559 --> 41:18.102

41:18.310 --> 41:21.021

Hungry?

41:32.408 --> 41:33.576
Come on out here.

41:36.078 --> 41:39.790
You ready for the new
world order, Olivia Moore?

41:39.999 --> 41:41.792
Ready to do your part
for your kind?

41:43.043 --> 41:44.128
I don't know what...

41:44.295 --> 41:47.465
Someday soon,
Seattle's gonna be the capital
of the zombie homeland,

41:47.673 --> 41:49.508
and a lot of people
aren't gonna wanna
see that happen.

41:51.427 --> 41:53.053
So are you with us

41:53.262 --> 41:54.847
or against us?

41:55.055 --> 41:56.599
