04:08.304 --> 04:09.974
Hello.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.644
What are you doing
in my house?

05:50.005 --> 05:51.274
We're gonna be late.

05:53.342 --> 05:54.678
I got it.

06:13.829 --> 06:16.366
There you are.
Who knew you had so much stuff?

06:18.067 --> 06:19.704
Your dad is the Tetris king.

06:25.875 --> 06:30.844
- She doesn't have to like it. Not why we're doing this.
- Where's Luke at?

06:30.846 --> 06:33.113
He's at the ball park with his friends.
We're gonna pick him up...

06:33.115 --> 06:35.950
- Jesus, we are late.
- You expect something else from this family?

06:35.952 --> 06:36.987
No, I do not.

06:38.387 --> 06:40.221
Ain't no way we're gonna
get there before dinner.

06:40.223 --> 06:41.992
Uncle Marv said
he could leave a key.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.424
Okay.

06:44.426 --> 06:45.395
Huh?

06:46.930 --> 06:48.065
Oh, boom!

06:49.031 --> 06:50.000
Let's go!

06:51.101 --> 06:52.269
Seat belt, missy.

07:13.089 --> 07:14.358
Luke!

07:19.930 --> 07:21.229
We just started a new game.

07:21.231 --> 07:23.498
Sorry, kiddo.
We're already late.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.038
Hey, let me know how it goes.

07:30.005 --> 07:31.041
Okay.

07:32.942 --> 07:35.275
Why can't I just
stay here for the weekend?

07:35.277 --> 07:38.246
- By yourself? No, sir.
- All my friends do it.

07:38.248 --> 07:40.281
- Yeah, exactly.
- Exactly.

07:40.283 --> 07:41.916
Besides, it might be nice
for you to help your sister

07:41.918 --> 07:43.217
move into her
new school tomorrow.

07:43.219 --> 07:44.454
Hold on.
I'm gonna leave a message.

07:45.921 --> 07:46.955
You smell horrible.

07:46.957 --> 07:48.589
Hi, Uncle Marv.
It's Cindy.

07:48.591 --> 07:50.325
We got a late start,

07:50.327 --> 07:54.195
so we're not going to be
to Gatlin Lake until, um,

07:54.197 --> 07:55.430
around 9:00 or 10:00.

07:55.432 --> 07:56.864
Hey, guys, cut it out.

07:56.866 --> 07:58.265
We'll just stop for a bite.

07:58.267 --> 08:00.635
Do you guys remember
Uncle Marv and Aunt Sheryl?

08:00.637 --> 08:03.537
I remember Uncle Marv
smelled like wet dog and beer.

08:07.176 --> 08:10.477
You know Mom and Dad are going broke over
sending you to boarding school, right?

08:10.479 --> 08:12.580
Hey, we never said that.

08:12.582 --> 08:14.851
Why else would you guys
have canceled the cable?

08:19.421 --> 08:20.490
See? I was right.

08:24.293 --> 08:26.628
- You think I wanted this?
- I think you like the attention.

08:26.630 --> 08:28.161
- You're a dick.
- You're a queef.

08:28.163 --> 08:29.132
Whoa!

08:30.599 --> 08:31.835
What-what's queef?

08:36.138 --> 08:37.240
Seriously, what's a queef?

08:55.358 --> 08:58.161
- You want me to go get her?
- She's punishing us.

09:02.666 --> 09:04.598
Folks need another couple
of minutes with the menus or...

09:04.600 --> 09:07.003
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna
need a few, thank you.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.007
I'll go.

09:23.353 --> 09:24.555
Not even gonna
pretend, huh?

09:27.357 --> 09:28.559
What difference
does it make?

09:41.103 --> 09:42.573
What difference
does it make, right?

09:45.007 --> 09:47.176
Just ditch those before
you get to your new school.

09:49.713 --> 09:51.379
God forbid they kick me out.

09:51.381 --> 09:53.614
Oh, they're not gonna
give up that easy.

09:53.616 --> 09:55.452
No, no. Not like
you and Dad, huh?

10:00.623 --> 10:02.526
I wish someone
had done this for me.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.497
You turned out fine.

10:07.664 --> 10:08.999
You didn't
know me back then.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.536
I made mistakes.
A lot of them.

10:15.137 --> 10:18.706
Teenagers do stupid shit, Mom.
I am a teenager.

10:18.708 --> 10:20.611
This is more than
stupid shit, Kins.

10:22.177 --> 10:23.379
This past year?

10:25.482 --> 10:28.149
Sabrina, Laurie, none of them.

10:28.151 --> 10:31.052
None of their parents
are sending them off.

10:31.054 --> 10:33.321
Well, I'm not their mother.
I'm yours.

10:33.323 --> 10:34.257
They're lucky.

10:35.492 --> 10:37.094
And I am worried about you.

10:39.728 --> 10:41.198
And now you won't
have to worry.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.236
Be just the three of you again like
it always should have been, right?

10:50.073 --> 10:51.408
You believe that?

12:16.859 --> 12:18.294
There even anybody here?

12:19.661 --> 12:22.199
I think everybody leaves
after Labor Day.

12:45.821 --> 12:48.858
The office is
a little further down.

14:16.546 --> 14:18.645
They left a note, said they'd
see us in the morning.

14:18.647 --> 14:20.814
We're staying in number 47.

15:34.523 --> 15:36.356
This is nice, right?

15:36.358 --> 15:37.793
Mm. Cozy.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.566
Okay, so, who's staying
in this trailer?

15:45.568 --> 15:46.603
All of us.

15:47.336 --> 15:48.869
Of course.

15:52.809 --> 15:53.810
Hmm.

15:55.610 --> 15:57.611
Is there someone else
staying here?

15:57.613 --> 15:58.547
That's weird.

16:00.717 --> 16:02.616
Hmm. Should I toss it?

16:02.618 --> 16:04.117
What, are you
gonna eat it?

16:04.119 --> 16:06.353
- Throw it out.
- It smells fine. It's beef and broccoli.

16:06.355 --> 16:08.356
- Please do not eat that.
- I love it.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.627
- There are no glasses.
- Just chug, woman.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.562
Remember when we went
camping in the Rockies?

16:14.564 --> 16:16.529
- That's exactly what I was referring to.
- Mm-hmm.

16:19.569 --> 16:21.836
Is that Uncle Marv?

16:21.838 --> 16:23.471
- Probably.
- He probably smelled the wine.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.976
Mom, there's someone knocking.

16:27.709 --> 16:30.012
No, don't get up.
I've got it.

16:35.118 --> 16:37.451
It's a girl.

16:37.453 --> 16:38.387
Girl?

16:44.660 --> 16:45.996
Can I help you?

16:47.662 --> 16:48.831
Is Tamara home?

16:52.667 --> 16:54.403
I think you have
the wrong trailer.

16:57.172 --> 16:58.474
Okay.

17:09.084 --> 17:10.483
I didn't think anyone else
was staying here.

17:10.486 --> 17:12.953
She must be lost.

17:12.954 --> 17:16.026
All right, guys. You wanna
play some cards or something?

17:21.930 --> 17:24.767
- Well, you and me.
- It's you and me.

17:41.217 --> 17:43.085
You guys sure
you don't wanna join us?

17:44.152 --> 17:46.019
Oh, come on.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.956
Can we just have one last evening
where you're not on your phones?

17:55.730 --> 17:56.700
Okay.

17:57.700 --> 17:58.834
Thank you.

18:02.537 --> 18:04.471
What do you wanna play?

18:04.473 --> 18:06.940
Five hundred.
We'll keep you here all night.

18:06.942 --> 18:08.411
Oh.

18:15.084 --> 18:17.251
Come on, why don't
you just put that down,

18:17.253 --> 18:19.589
just for a while,
and join us?

18:25.126 --> 18:26.462
Sweetheart, this, um...

18:29.565 --> 18:30.866
this parent gig,
you know, it's, uh...

18:33.102 --> 18:34.004
it's tough.

18:35.203 --> 18:37.606
The bad grades.
Cutting class.

18:38.874 --> 18:39.942
We're just scared,
you know?

18:53.623 --> 18:54.524
Thank you.

18:59.895 --> 19:01.961
- Hey. Hey, baby doll.
- Where are you going?

19:01.963 --> 19:03.030
I need some air.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.567
Should I go after her?

19:07.569 --> 19:09.969
No. It'll only
make it worse.

19:09.971 --> 19:11.141
Either one of us.

19:13.241 --> 19:14.911
Luke, you go talk to her.

19:16.112 --> 19:17.611
What? Why?

19:17.613 --> 19:18.748
Because you're her brother.

19:20.283 --> 19:22.486
Can you please do
what your mother asks you?

19:26.322 --> 19:27.491
Okay.

19:28.924 --> 19:30.493
I don't know what you guys
want me to say to her.

19:41.970 --> 19:44.106
No one said
it would be easy.

19:53.015 --> 19:54.184
Kinsey!

19:57.853 --> 19:58.921
Hey, Kins!

20:14.135 --> 20:15.604
Kinsey!

20:39.961 --> 20:42.028
What are you doing?

20:42.030 --> 20:44.898
I don't know. Mom told me
to come hang with you.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.900
- Such a bitch.
- Just being dramatic.

20:47.902 --> 20:49.639
- Yeah, ya think?
- I meant you.

20:50.805 --> 20:51.807
Fuck off.

20:56.144 --> 20:58.344
You know you're supposed
to inhale those? Cigarettes.

20:58.346 --> 21:00.584
You're supposed to like, um,
actually inhale them.

21:01.784 --> 21:03.883
Come on.

21:03.885 --> 21:06.288
Ah, Sis,
just get over it.

21:08.123 --> 21:11.161
They wanna send you away.
I mean, boo-fuckin'-hoo.

21:12.728 --> 21:15.262
Yeah, you're
out of here next year.

21:15.264 --> 21:16.866
You get to start
your own life.

21:19.067 --> 21:20.636
Maybe it's like that
for you too.

21:23.139 --> 21:25.141
You know, this place
could be a fresh start.

21:28.309 --> 21:30.012
You could be
whoever you want to be.

21:43.124 --> 21:44.026
Don't.

21:55.970 --> 21:57.871
You really think
we're doing the right thing?

22:01.242 --> 22:02.709
I know we are.

22:02.711 --> 22:04.314
It's not like
we haven't tried everything.

22:07.216 --> 22:08.184
Yeah.

22:20.496 --> 22:24.931
It'll be nice to have the house
back to ourselves again, I guess,

22:24.933 --> 22:26.268
once Luke goes off to college.

22:31.273 --> 22:33.209
We can do it on the couch
like we used to.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.115
I look so tired.

22:42.383 --> 22:43.752
You look beautiful.

23:03.271 --> 23:04.473
I love you.

23:09.879 --> 23:11.344
You lock 'em out?

23:11.346 --> 23:12.315
Mm-mmm.

23:27.095 --> 23:30.063
Guys, the door's not even locked.

23:30.065 --> 23:31.301
Is Tamara home?

23:34.469 --> 23:37.273
You lost or something?
You want me to call someone?

23:40.375 --> 23:41.877
Are you okay?

24:12.274 --> 24:13.209
Same girl?

24:15.110 --> 24:16.045
Yeah.

24:17.046 --> 24:18.411
Where are the kids?

24:18.413 --> 24:20.282
- What?
- Did they wander off?

24:26.921 --> 24:28.223
Luke!

24:29.424 --> 24:30.359
Kinsey!

24:32.393 --> 24:34.127
I'm gonna get my shoes.

24:34.129 --> 24:35.495
I'm sure they're okay.
I mean...

24:35.497 --> 24:37.566
- That girl weirded me out, hon.
- Yeah. Yeah, that was...

24:40.268 --> 24:41.805
a little...

25:06.027 --> 25:07.894
Remember when I was
in Little League?

25:07.896 --> 25:10.330
You used to follow me
to the park.

25:10.332 --> 25:13.499
Yeah, I always wanted to play.
You never let me.

25:13.501 --> 25:15.537
Well, 'cause you were little, Sis.
That's just how it goes.

25:17.573 --> 25:20.243
You could barely lift up the
bat, let alone hit anything.

25:23.545 --> 25:25.245
Here.

25:25.247 --> 25:26.615
Wind up for the pitch.

25:31.487 --> 25:33.022
Mmm, what about
the mailbox?

25:35.924 --> 25:37.990
Oh, nice.

25:37.992 --> 25:40.326
- Should have let me play.
- Hmm.

25:40.328 --> 25:44.497
What do you think Uncle Marv and Aunt
Sheryl do here all alone in the winter?

25:44.499 --> 25:45.631
Oh, I don't know.

25:45.633 --> 25:48.067
Probably have tons
of filthy, porno sex.

25:48.069 --> 25:49.004
Ew.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.008
Weird.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.478
Yeah.

25:59.715 --> 26:01.885
- Are you scared?
- No.

26:12.428 --> 26:13.563
Hello.

26:24.605 --> 26:25.973
Hello.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.274
Oh, geez!

26:28.276 --> 26:30.009
I'm gonna kill you.
That's not funny.

26:30.011 --> 26:31.346
Oh, God.

26:44.692 --> 26:48.195
Mmm. Bingo.

26:48.197 --> 26:49.563
Okay, yes. One shot.

26:49.565 --> 26:51.230
- Three.
- Two.

26:51.232 --> 26:52.399
All right.

26:56.071 --> 26:57.707
- What was that?
- I don't know.

27:03.778 --> 27:06.015
- Come on, we should get out of here.
- Wait. Wait.

27:12.321 --> 27:13.256
Is somebody there?

27:15.556 --> 27:17.360
- Luke, seriously, let's go.
- No, let's just...

27:30.271 --> 27:31.206
Hello.

27:35.411 --> 27:36.645
Is somebody there?

27:45.787 --> 27:47.586
Oh, geez.

27:50.292 --> 27:51.494
It scared me
half to death.

27:56.364 --> 27:58.698
What the hell is that?

28:01.335 --> 28:02.438
Nothing.

28:11.513 --> 28:12.415
What the hell?

28:19.455 --> 28:20.690
What the fuck?

28:25.561 --> 28:27.063
- Luke.
- What?

28:48.150 --> 28:49.815
Oh, my God.

28:55.657 --> 28:57.490
Come on.

28:57.492 --> 28:59.094
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

29:11.773 --> 29:13.873
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:13.875 --> 29:15.742
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

29:15.744 --> 29:17.476
- Did we come from that way? No, no...
- I don't... I don't know.

29:17.478 --> 29:18.648
It all looks the same.

29:19.614 --> 29:20.613
Here. Okay.

29:22.316 --> 29:24.251
- Jesus!
- You guys, what the hell is going on?

29:24.253 --> 29:26.686
Uncle Marv and Aunt Sheryl are all cut
up and there's blood everywhere...

29:26.688 --> 29:28.487
- Luke.
- If this is a joke...

29:28.489 --> 29:30.890
It's not a joke. I swear I
would not joke about this.

29:30.892 --> 29:32.325
Where was this?
Where did you see this?

29:32.327 --> 29:36.396
In one of the trailers. One of the
trailers was open and we went inside.

29:36.398 --> 29:37.863
I'm... I'm not...
I'm not messing with you.

29:37.865 --> 29:39.865
I swear.

29:39.867 --> 29:42.370
He's not. He's not.
I... We both swear.

29:44.338 --> 29:45.538
They're all cut up.

29:45.540 --> 29:46.840
Okay, get Kinsey
back in the trailer.

29:46.842 --> 29:48.207
What?

29:48.209 --> 29:50.209
- Take Kinsey back to the trailer.
- Okay.

29:50.211 --> 29:52.879
Call the police
and lock the door, okay?

29:52.881 --> 29:53.783
Okay.

29:55.816 --> 29:57.284
- Do you know how to get back there?
- Yeah.

29:57.286 --> 29:59.186
- Can you show me?
- Yeah, I think so.

29:59.188 --> 29:59.789
We came from there.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.128
I'm scared, Dad.

30:06.862 --> 30:08.397
Who would do
something like that?

30:18.306 --> 30:19.909
Okay.

30:24.478 --> 30:26.246
- You're okay.
- No, I'm not.

30:26.248 --> 30:29.282
- You're okay.
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

30:29.284 --> 30:32.451
They weren't okay. They weren't okay.
They weren't okay.

30:34.355 --> 30:37.657
You are going to be okay.
It's okay.

30:37.659 --> 30:38.828
It's okay.

30:44.298 --> 30:45.200
Mom.

30:47.436 --> 30:49.839
Mom, the phones.
The phones.

30:59.448 --> 31:00.516
Mommy.

31:02.417 --> 31:03.619
Oh, my God.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.612
Oh, my God.

31:36.817 --> 31:37.886
Hello.

31:39.888 --> 31:41.287
Hello.

31:41.289 --> 31:43.355
<i>9-1-1 emergency.</i>

31:43.357 --> 31:44.392
Hello, can you hear me?

31:50.966 --> 31:52.468
Hello. Can you hear me?

31:54.536 --> 31:55.403
- Mom.
- Hello?

31:56.337 --> 31:57.272
Hello? Hell...

31:58.673 --> 32:00.774
Mom. Mom.

32:00.776 --> 32:02.007
Mom?

32:02.009 --> 32:03.645
Mom.

32:05.613 --> 32:07.781
What do you want? Hello?

32:07.783 --> 32:09.716
- Hello!
- Mom!

32:09.718 --> 32:12.819
Can you hear me?
I need to report a murder.

32:12.821 --> 32:14.290
Hello. Can anyone hear...

32:18.093 --> 32:19.892
No.

32:23.931 --> 32:25.598
Get in the bedroom!

32:25.600 --> 32:26.699
Shut it!

32:29.571 --> 32:31.737
In the bathroom!
Shut the door!

32:37.045 --> 32:38.680
God. Please, God.

32:54.662 --> 32:57.063
Leave us alone!

32:57.065 --> 32:58.334
Mommy.

33:00.102 --> 33:01.370
Who is she?

33:35.469 --> 33:37.035
- Okay.
- I got it. I got it.

33:37.037 --> 33:38.838
- I'm gonna lift you up.
- Okay.

33:46.014 --> 33:47.616
Pull yourself up!

33:51.987 --> 33:53.488
Come on!

33:56.690 --> 33:58.056
Go! You go! Run!

33:58.058 --> 33:59.958
Oh, my God!

33:59.960 --> 34:03.095
Run. You have to run!

34:03.097 --> 34:04.866
No. Oh, my God.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.734
Baby, go.

34:12.706 --> 34:13.806
Mommy!

34:18.913 --> 34:21.047
Let go of her!

35:16.538 --> 35:17.773
This is it, right?

35:18.607 --> 35:19.608
Yeah, it's this one.

35:23.511 --> 35:25.678
- Okay, just wait here.
- What?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.246
Just let me look.

35:27.248 --> 35:29.218
I've already been there.
I've already seen it.

35:59.180 --> 36:01.616
They don't work.

36:03.151 --> 36:04.553
Back room.

36:36.084 --> 36:38.817
We gotta call the cops.

36:38.819 --> 36:41.823
- You got a phone on you?
- No, I... I think I left it back at the trailer.

36:43.991 --> 36:44.959
Okay.

36:48.363 --> 36:49.931
What the fuck?

36:50.765 --> 36:51.667
Right there.

36:55.303 --> 36:57.770
Fuck.

36:57.772 --> 36:58.873
Oh, fuck.

37:06.381 --> 37:08.614
<i>Hi, Uncle Marv. It's Cindy.</i>

37:08.616 --> 37:10.283
<i>We got a late start,</i>

37:10.285 --> 37:14.120
<i>so we're not going to be to Gatlin
Lake until, um, around 9:00 or 10:00</i>

37:14.122 --> 37:15.324
Shit.

37:16.056 --> 37:17.656
What was that?

37:20.962 --> 37:23.196
- Dad?
- Shh.

37:35.810 --> 37:38.581
Fuck! Get down!

37:44.118 --> 37:45.685
Who is that?

38:04.239 --> 38:06.339
Okay, we're gonna
get back to Mom and Kinsey.

38:06.341 --> 38:08.741
Okay, we're gonna make
a run for it, okay?

38:08.743 --> 38:10.243
- Mm-hmm.
- You're gonna run like hell.

38:10.245 --> 38:11.277
- I'm gonna be right behind you.
- Okay.

38:11.279 --> 38:13.212
And you don't stop until
we get right back to them.

38:13.214 --> 38:14.149
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:16.216 --> 38:17.151
Go!

38:23.892 --> 38:24.960
Dad.

38:31.198 --> 38:32.364
Shit.

38:41.843 --> 38:43.076
- What are you doing?
- There was a gun.

38:43.078 --> 38:44.647
I remember they used
to have a gun in here.

38:47.948 --> 38:48.916
Hang on.

38:55.390 --> 38:56.658
Do you know how to use that?

38:58.460 --> 39:00.062
Are you... Are you
really gonna shoot them?

39:08.469 --> 39:10.103
Okay, you have five seconds!

39:10.105 --> 39:13.004
Five seconds to leave
and then I start shooting!

39:16.277 --> 39:17.680
Five!

39:18.513 --> 39:19.681
Four!

39:20.448 --> 39:21.781
Three!

39:22.817 --> 39:23.952
Two!

39:25.120 --> 39:26.087
One!

39:40.134 --> 39:41.203
Go check back there.

39:47.875 --> 39:48.843
They're gone.

39:50.344 --> 39:51.413
Okay, we'll go back.

39:52.781 --> 39:54.216
Come on,
you stay with me. Okay?

39:57.285 --> 39:58.219
Come on!

40:10.098 --> 40:11.033
Oh, my God.

40:16.805 --> 40:19.071
No!

40:19.073 --> 40:20.007
Okay.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.777
Help!

40:24.212 --> 40:25.280
Please!

40:42.897 --> 40:45.801
Fuck! Kinsey! Cindy!

40:50.171 --> 40:51.205
That's my phone.

41:22.169 --> 41:23.337
Oh.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.843
Dad, what is it?

41:32.279 --> 41:33.314
No, no, no!

41:39.319 --> 41:41.987
We have
to go find your sister.

41:41.989 --> 41:45.558
Listen to me! We're
gonna go find your sister, okay?

41:45.560 --> 41:47.158
- I need you to be with me.
- Okay.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.895
What do we have to do?

41:48.897 --> 41:50.562
I'm gonna get the car
and we're gonna go find her.

41:50.564 --> 41:51.833
All right? Okay?

41:53.567 --> 41:54.969
Kinsey!

42:14.087 --> 42:15.022
Kin!

42:17.357 --> 42:19.260
Kinsey!

42:22.529 --> 42:23.865
Where is she?

42:26.600 --> 42:28.202
Come on, Kins!

42:33.607 --> 42:35.109
Kinsey!

42:38.478 --> 42:40.112
Kinsey!

42:40.114 --> 42:42.013
Oh, shit!

43:01.502 --> 43:04.038
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

43:28.161 --> 43:30.996
Hello?

44:36.064 --> 44:37.562
Leave us alone!

44:37.564 --> 44:39.531
But we've just started.

44:39.533 --> 44:40.501
Aah!

45:03.857 --> 45:06.424
Oh, God. Dad?

45:06.426 --> 45:08.726
No. Dad. Dad. Dad, wake up.

45:08.728 --> 45:10.562
Wake up. Come on.

45:10.564 --> 45:13.332
Fuck. Luke, Dad.

45:13.334 --> 45:14.667
Fuck.

45:14.669 --> 45:16.368
- You okay?
- Fuck.

45:16.370 --> 45:17.402
Oh, my God.

45:20.507 --> 45:22.241
Aah! I can't...

45:22.243 --> 45:24.275
I can't.

45:24.277 --> 45:28.746
Okay, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm gonna, uh,
try and, uh, pull-pull it out.

45:28.748 --> 45:31.317
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna...
I'm gonna...

45:31.319 --> 45:34.587
Aah! Shit.

45:34.589 --> 45:36.821
Fucking...

45:36.823 --> 45:39.460
Tell me what to do.
What do you want me to do?

45:41.261 --> 45:43.596
Okay, you...
you gotta get out of here.

45:43.598 --> 45:44.897
I'm not gonna leave you.

45:44.899 --> 45:47.266
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

45:47.268 --> 45:49.134
- You gotta find your sister.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

45:49.136 --> 45:50.071
She needs you.

45:51.806 --> 45:54.339
The gun.
Okay, find the gun.

45:54.341 --> 45:57.143
Um... Here.

45:57.145 --> 45:59.511
- You know how to use that thing?
- No.

45:59.513 --> 46:01.647
You just...
It's loaded, okay?

46:01.649 --> 46:04.482
Pull back on the hammer and
then you squeeze the trigger.

46:05.620 --> 46:07.585
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

46:07.587 --> 46:09.221
You're gonna be okay.

46:09.223 --> 46:12.393
Oh, fuck.

46:14.895 --> 46:17.562
Okay. Okay.

46:17.564 --> 46:19.665
I'm gonna go find her, okay?

46:19.667 --> 46:21.734
We're gonna get the cops. We're
gonna get the ambulance, okay?

46:21.736 --> 46:23.105
I'm gonna be right back.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.243
I'm proud of you.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.515
I know.

47:19.593 --> 47:22.296
Aah!

47:23.464 --> 47:25.834
Fuck! Aah!

47:39.747 --> 47:41.449
Please.

47:42.783 --> 47:44.685
Please.

47:46.486 --> 47:49.621
Please.

47:49.623 --> 47:52.391
Why are you
doing this?

47:52.393 --> 47:53.826
Fuck!

48:10.745 --> 48:14.879
Please. Hey, whatever it is
you're doing, just stop.

48:14.881 --> 48:17.850
Okay, you leave
my family alone.

48:17.852 --> 48:20.051
Let my family go.

48:20.053 --> 48:21.953
Please.

48:24.424 --> 48:26.525
Please.

48:30.598 --> 48:34.732
Okay. Okay, can we just
talk about this, okay?

48:36.370 --> 48:38.569
Aah!

48:38.571 --> 48:40.071
Fuck!

48:40.073 --> 48:42.940
Aah!

48:42.942 --> 48:45.310
You mother... Fuck you!

48:45.312 --> 48:48.315
Aah! Aah!

50:36.457 --> 50:37.859
Oh, my God.

50:41.828 --> 50:43.497
Kinsey!

51:12.091 --> 51:13.660
Hello.

52:02.710 --> 52:05.112
Whee!

52:08.982 --> 52:10.584
No, no, no.

52:13.520 --> 52:14.652
Stop!

52:14.654 --> 52:17.623
Let her go.

52:17.625 --> 52:19.594
Luke.

52:21.529 --> 52:23.031
Luke. Luke.

52:31.739 --> 52:33.641
Put the fucking knife down.

52:35.975 --> 52:37.744
Put the knife down!

53:00.301 --> 53:02.770
Are you gonna shoot me?

53:05.272 --> 53:07.873
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

53:07.875 --> 53:10.308
Give me the gun, Luke.
Give me the gun.

53:10.310 --> 53:13.515
- Run! Run!
- I will fucking shoot her! I will fucking shoot her!

53:19.719 --> 53:22.589
Go, go, go.

53:41.375 --> 53:43.942
Hey, Luke, the window.

53:43.944 --> 53:46.844
- Do you think you can reach it?
- Yeah, I could give it a try.

53:46.846 --> 53:48.913
Yeah, I'll boost you.

53:48.915 --> 53:50.951
Oh, shit, it hurts.

53:55.089 --> 53:57.054
- You ready?
- Okay.

53:57.056 --> 53:59.357
Okay.

53:59.359 --> 54:03.096
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

54:13.640 --> 54:15.306
Oh, my God.

54:15.308 --> 54:17.911
Okay. Hey, you're okay.
Hey, hey.

54:23.116 --> 54:25.049
There's so much blood.

54:25.051 --> 54:26.752
- Grab that shirt off, okay?
- What?

54:26.754 --> 54:28.288
Take that flannel off.

54:29.422 --> 54:30.991
Okay.

54:35.062 --> 54:36.663
It's okay.

54:42.169 --> 54:43.171
Mom.

54:44.837 --> 54:47.205
I know.

54:47.207 --> 54:49.908
Hey, we're gonna
get out of this.

54:49.910 --> 54:52.243
- I tried to get her... I tried to get her hand.
- We're gonna get out of this.

54:52.245 --> 54:53.944
Stop.

54:53.946 --> 54:56.147
I had her hand.
I couldn't get her.

54:56.149 --> 54:58.016
I was so mean.

54:58.018 --> 54:59.687
- I was so...
- Hey.

55:01.187 --> 55:04.089
Do you remember that...
Hey, do you remember that...

55:04.091 --> 55:06.891
that time that I fell out
of that tree at Marshpoint.

55:06.893 --> 55:08.893
Do you remember that?

55:08.895 --> 55:10.395
- You remember that.
- Yeah.

55:10.397 --> 55:12.196
Right.

55:12.198 --> 55:14.065
You...

55:14.067 --> 55:17.002
- You rode your bike home even though it was broken.
- Yeah.

55:17.004 --> 55:18.804
You were an idiot.

55:18.806 --> 55:21.806
Total idiot.
Mom found me on the couch.

55:21.808 --> 55:24.946
I was eating pizza, trying to
pretend like nothing happened.

55:27.314 --> 55:29.147
My leg was
all swollen and blue,

55:29.149 --> 55:32.420
and she was like, "Luke,
what the fuck did you do?"

55:35.189 --> 55:36.487
- Aah!
- It's okay.

55:40.861 --> 55:43.261
It's okay.

55:43.263 --> 55:46.498
- She probably said it just like that too.
- It was exactly like that.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.400
"Luke, what the fuck
did you do?"

55:48.402 --> 55:50.338
And she tells us
to watch our mouths.

55:51.939 --> 55:53.674
Here, give me your arm.

55:57.277 --> 55:59.310
It's my fault
that she's dead.

55:59.312 --> 56:01.078
Kins, stop.

56:01.080 --> 56:03.748
No, you wouldn't
have been here, Luke.

56:03.750 --> 56:06.851
- You wouldn't have been here if I wasn't such a fuck-up.
- Stop. Just shut up.

56:06.853 --> 56:08.520
- No.
- Shut up.

56:08.522 --> 56:10.855
You know that's not true.

56:10.857 --> 56:13.424
- I'm sorry.
- You know that.

56:13.426 --> 56:14.861
I'm sorry.

56:17.897 --> 56:20.200
Why are they
doing this to us?

56:21.502 --> 56:22.837
Why?

56:24.937 --> 56:27.205
Okay, we got to find
a way out of this.

Okay, we got to get

Hi. Um, yeah, we need help. There's

Um, I don't know.
I'm not sure.

58:53.620 --> 58:56.520
I wasn't... I wasn't paying attention.
It's some trailer park.

58:56.522 --> 58:58.589
I don't know.
I don't know where we are.

58:58.591 --> 59:01.458
Um... Uh... Uh... Uh, Gatlin Lake.

59:01.460 --> 59:03.263
It's Gatlin Lake.

Hello?

59:07.600 --> 59:08.935
Hello?

59:28.689 --> 59:30.321
Just leave us alone.

59:37.663 --> 59:39.901
Just leave us alone!

01:02:13.553 --> 01:02:16.120
I killed one of yours.

01:02:16.122 --> 01:02:17.724
How's that feel, huh?

01:02:19.558 --> 01:02:21.259
How's that fucking feel?

01:04:24.417 --> 01:04:25.853
Luke! Luke!

01:04:28.587 --> 01:04:29.790

Come on.
I need you to help me. Ready?

01:04:59.652 --> 01:05:02.587
Come here. I got you.
Right here. Right here.

01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:04.388
Right here. Right here.

Okay. We need

Oh, my God, please. No.

Okay. Come here.
Come on. It's okay.

- Okay, I need... I need... I need you to help my brother.

01:06:47.893 --> 01:06:50.728
He's at the clubhouse. I told him
to meet me at the clubhouse.

01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:52.663
That's where
he might be.

01:06:52.665 --> 01:06:55.433
And there are these crazy people,
and they're trying to kill us.

01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:18.758
Where are the keys?

01:07:19.859 --> 01:07:22.763
Where are the keys?

01:07:35.575 --> 01:07:37.643
Come on, come on, come on.

Get off! Get off! Get off!

01:08:41.707 --> 01:08:43.009
Why are you doing this?

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:48.715
Why not?

Oh, thank God.
