03:47.894 --> 03:49.161
Hey.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.866
Hey, hey.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.061
Mama...

08:55.334 --> 08:58.370
You goin' for a ride?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.574
Looks that way.

09:00.674 --> 09:04.276
Want some company?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.813
Your knee's not right.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.682
Then I'll take the quad.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.849
That thing spooks Shadow.
You know that.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.957
Those stalls still need
to be cleaned out.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.859
Unless you want to pay
somebody else to do it?

09:18.959 --> 09:22.027
No. I'll do it.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.196
Which trail are you taking?

09:25.698 --> 09:27.634
The wash.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.870
Why do you always got
to ride the damn wash?

09:29.970 --> 09:33.040
- 'Cause it's the best trail.
- Yeah, it is.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.307
That's why we can't keep the
damn Mexicans out of it.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.265
If I see any "damn Mexicans,"

09:46.666 --> 09:49.178
I'll tell 'em hello from you.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.028
Did you bring a
walkie-talkie with you?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.730
Yup!

09:56.830 --> 10:00.431
Don't leave that
coffee cup out there.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.317
Shit, dude! What the hell?

10:18.819 --> 10:20.787
- We're going shooting today.
- So go.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.289
Come with us, ass hat.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.692
I don't feel like shooting cactus
with you two faggots today.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.525
We're not shootin' cactus today.

10:33.832 --> 10:37.302
- Come on.
- Ah! You dick!

14:04.510 --> 14:07.280
Thank you. Thank you. Very.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.416
You're very welcome.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.651
The na... the name?

14:11.751 --> 14:13.384
Do you speak English?

14:17.157 --> 14:18.892
His name is Shadow.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.593
Shadow.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.293
It's okay.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.803
<i>Sí, sí,</i> work.

15:18.283 --> 15:20.351
Oh.

15:34.599 --> 15:36.234
<i>Sí.</i>

15:59.691 --> 16:01.995
Yes, please.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.561
<i>Gracias, gracias.</i>

16:04.730 --> 16:06.197
Sorry.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.370
Okay.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.779
Good day!

16:19.879 --> 16:22.181
Good day.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.271
No shit.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.205
You guys! You guys, come here!

17:21.808 --> 17:23.409
Quick!

17:24.911 --> 17:27.213
There's some Mexicans
right there in the wash.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.182
Where?

17:29.282 --> 17:32.752
- Right there by that tree right there.
- I don't see 'em.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.919
Use your scope, dude.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.761
Okay, yeah, I got 'em.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.530
Yeah, those guys
are definitely illegal.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.866
- How do you know for sure?
- Duh, Sean.

17:46.966 --> 17:50.034
You think they're here
just out for a stroll?

17:50.336 --> 17:52.338
Hand me the 06.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.708
No, dude, you can't just start
shooting at those guys.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.412
I so knew you two fags
would puss out on me!

17:59.512 --> 18:02.215
Look, I told you,
we're only gonna scare them.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.317
You don't shoot at them.
You shoot near them.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.219
- Now, give me the gun.
- Screw you.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.554
Fine.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.757
I'll use this old piece of shit.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.493
Sure I don't miss and hit one of 'em.

18:14.893 --> 18:18.164
You're such a dick. Just make sure
you aim way far away from them.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.531
Yeah, no shit, bozo.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.507
I'm just gonna scare 'em...

18:27.607 --> 18:30.140
back across the line.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.945
Oh!

19:06.045 --> 19:07.380
Brad, what the hell?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.283
- That last shot was way too close!
- I didn't hit him, Sean!

19:10.383 --> 19:13.053
Besides, the point is to get close
so it scares the shit out of them.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.722
Brad, check it out.
See that big ol' jug of water?

19:18.024 --> 19:19.492
Yeah. I got it.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.628
You hit that thing,
it'll scare the hell of out 'em.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.363
Plus, they won't have
any water, right?

19:23.463 --> 19:26.232
Then they'll totally have to run their
sorry ass back across the line.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.301
Genius.

19:28.401 --> 19:32.036
- Hey, hand me some more 06 shells, dude.
- Let me take a look at this shit.

19:37.709 --> 19:40.447
Are you freaking crazy?
The thing's, like, right next to them.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.548
You could totally screw that shot up!

19:42.648 --> 19:45.318
We're not using my dad's rifle to
shoot that close to those guys.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.820
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

19:46.920 --> 19:51.088
Look, why don't you show Kev and I
what a safe distance is to be shot at?

19:51.390 --> 19:54.077
It's a killer scope on that thing.
You're not gonna hit 'em.

19:54.177 --> 19:57.828
Go for it, Sean-o. You could
shoot the tits off a fly.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.681
- No!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

20:15.781 --> 20:19.252
- Sean, you just took out that lady, man!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

20:19.352 --> 20:21.487
What the hell did you
shoot her for, dude?

20:21.587 --> 20:22.822
I didn't shoot her, asshole!

20:22.922 --> 20:25.725
She came over the wash! I was
trying to miss the fucking Mexican!

20:31.364 --> 20:32.232
- Oh, God.
- She's moving.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.962
- She's moving, dude. Look, look.
- You swear to God?

20:34.062 --> 20:35.826
I swear to God. Just look.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.142
What are we gonna do?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.477
We got to get out of here.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.849
- What? We can't just leave her there!
- You want to go down there, Sean?

20:49.949 --> 20:53.686
When we get back, we'll call 911
from a payphone or something.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.821
Besides, the Mexican
guy was helping her!

21:07.133 --> 21:09.133
Oh, f...

21:12.672 --> 21:15.006
- Oh, what happened?
- Uh...

21:17.809 --> 21:21.678
Where's Roy? Roy!

21:23.448 --> 21:25.483
My horse?

21:29.554 --> 21:31.722
Get my horse.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.857
Jose!

21:35.193 --> 21:38.464
My horse. My horse.

21:38.564 --> 21:41.868
- I-I-I get horse.
- Get my horse.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.538
Shadow?

21:49.508 --> 21:52.510
Oh. Shadow.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.092
- I have horse.
- All right.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.900
Hey.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.935
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

22:16.035 --> 22:18.602
Hey!

22:19.604 --> 22:21.739
Hey!

22:25.076 --> 22:27.613
Roy.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.853
- Livy.
- It's all right.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.984
What are we gonna do?
My dad's gonna kill me!

23:05.084 --> 23:07.587
Dude, your dad's never gonna
find out unless you freak out.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.889
She looked pretty bad to me,
dude. Maybe he hit her.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.691
I didn't hit her, you dick!
I was aiming at the ground!

23:11.791 --> 23:16.113
Shut up, Kevin! Look, we got to swear
not to tell anybody about this ever.

23:16.213 --> 23:19.532
Nobody! Because if anyone
finds out, we're all screwed!

23:19.632 --> 23:21.000
I'm not. I didn't even shoot at all!

23:21.100 --> 23:24.504
It doesn't matter, dumbass.
You're an accessory to the crime.

23:24.604 --> 23:27.639
- Sean's the one who shot her.
- Shut up!

23:52.964 --> 23:56.033
<i>Amigos!</i>

24:19.557 --> 24:21.224
Okay.

24:27.365 --> 24:30.935
We're gonna have to ask
you some more questions.

24:31.937 --> 24:35.575
Later. Tomorrow, I mean. Okay,
I'll drive you back to the house.

24:35.675 --> 24:40.111
No, no, I got to put up Livy's horse.

24:40.913 --> 24:44.416
Roy, we can get the
horse back to the barn.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.984
Nope.

25:56.688 --> 25:59.156
Uncle Roy?

27:07.125 --> 27:09.626
Really sorry, Roy.

27:13.464 --> 27:17.667
Roy, the sheriff mentioned they'd be
coming by here tomorrow morning, and...

27:17.767 --> 27:20.606
Kaye and I thought we could
stay out here with you tonight.

27:20.706 --> 27:23.141
If that suits you.

28:45.858 --> 28:49.492
Mom! I don't know how to do this one.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.032
Carry the 1.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.000
You got it.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.471
Dave, someone's at the door!

29:00.971 --> 29:04.208
- Dave?
- I'll get it!

29:05.210 --> 29:07.044
Carly?

29:12.583 --> 29:14.920
Carly.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.522
Can I help you?

29:22.026 --> 29:23.863
Dave?

29:23.963 --> 29:25.097
- Hey!
- Oh!

29:25.197 --> 29:27.865
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

29:33.137 --> 29:36.005
Carly, come here.

29:37.976 --> 29:42.446

38:45.856 --> 38:49.425
Okay, well, you let

39:13.350 --> 39:14.924
Good morning.

39:15.024 --> 39:18.990
I'm going to be teaching the class today.
Mrs. Edwards has had a family emergency.

39:19.090 --> 39:23.096
Hey, did you hear what happened?
Some illegals killed Mrs. McNary.

39:23.196 --> 39:25.326
- Mrs. McNary?
- She was riding on her ranch,

39:25.426 --> 39:28.665
and they were trying to steal
her horse, and they killed her.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.670
Young lady in the front,
please turn around.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.837

Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, now.

41:01.291 --> 41:03.194
Come on, back off.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.296
That's not the guy I saw.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.936
You're sure?

41:11.036 --> 41:13.037
Yeah, I'm sure.

41:13.137 --> 41:17.108
- Well, then, there may have been two.
- Why do you say that?

41:17.208 --> 41:20.744
Well, we picked him up
in a stolen truck, and...

41:21.246 --> 41:25.348
One of the things we found in the
truck was this. You recognize this?

41:26.250 --> 41:27.950
Yeah.

41:31.755 --> 41:34.993
Soon as we told him what happened,
he started talkin' pretty fast.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.859
He told us that he and another
guy that he was traveling with...

41:37.959 --> 41:40.632
met up with a woman on a horse,
and she gave him that blanket.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.541
He says that somebody was shooting
at him, and the lady fell off her horse...

41:44.641 --> 41:47.038
- and hit her head.
- That's a bunch of bullshit.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.841
I know, I'm just... just telling
you what the man said,

41:49.941 --> 41:51.643
keeping you in the
loop like I promised.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.646
I should have shot that son of
a bitch when I had the chance.

41:54.746 --> 41:58.782
I saw that you had a firearm
on you when we got there.

41:59.784 --> 42:02.025
- Were you shootin' at 'em, Roy?
- No.

42:02.125 --> 42:04.721
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

42:05.423 --> 42:08.763
- There were shots.
- There were shots?

42:08.863 --> 42:13.098
Yeah, they were rifle shots. That's why
I went out there in the first place.

42:13.198 --> 42:17.068
Well, why the hell didn't you tell me that
before? That's pretty damned important.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.771
I don't know, I...

42:19.871 --> 42:22.740
Hell, Randall, I mean, we was...

42:23.742 --> 42:25.610
All right, somethin' else.

42:25.710 --> 42:29.748
Now, our man in there I.D.'d the
same guy you did in the mugs.

42:29.848 --> 42:32.882
- He did?
- He did.

43:01.077 --> 43:02.881
- Hello, Matthew.
- How are you, Martha?

43:02.981 --> 43:06.817
Good, good. Got that good
apple wine ready for you.

43:06.917 --> 43:10.153
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay.

43:30.374 --> 43:31.910
- There you go.
- Thank you.

43:32.010 --> 43:33.344
- You got it.
- All right.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.412
- Give my best to your wife.
- I will.

44:30.634 --> 44:32.436
No.

44:50.420 --> 44:54.092
No. Oh.

44:56.094 --> 44:59.130
You're sure that's the guy
you standin' over Livy, right?

44:59.230 --> 45:04.433
- Yeah, that's him.
- Well, then I'd say we got our guy.

45:04.835 --> 45:06.402
Hmm.

45:07.604 --> 45:09.407
What?

45:09.507 --> 45:11.183
I don't know.

45:11.283 --> 45:16.447
Come on, Roy. How many times you and
I stood here and watched these boys...

45:16.547 --> 45:19.335
lie through their teeth just so
we'd send 'em back across the line

45:19.435 --> 45:23.053
- with a spanking and a warning?
- A bunch.

45:24.055 --> 45:27.809
I know it's not much for comfort, and
it ain't gonna bring Livy back, but...

45:27.909 --> 45:32.353
we got him, and he's
gonna be punished.

45:32.630 --> 45:35.466
Did you already have
your boys do a sweep?

45:35.566 --> 45:38.603
Yeah, but they didn't find anything,
but now I know you heard those shots too

45:38.703 --> 45:41.139
I'm having 'em do
another broader search.

45:41.239 --> 45:45.133
- Yeah, when? I told you that yesterday.
- Terrence is doin' a transport,

45:45.233 --> 45:48.377
and Matthew and Lewis are
pickin' up the slack, so soon.

45:50.380 --> 45:54.986
This afternoon, or early
tomorrow morning, latest.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.156
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

45:59.958 --> 46:01.790
Roy.

46:04.761 --> 46:06.729
We got him.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.548
<i>¿Bueno?</i>

46:35.759 --> 46:37.226
Paulina!

49:24.628 --> 49:26.695
<i>Vámonos!</i>

50:22.352 --> 50:24.353
<i>Vamos, vamos.</i>

52:18.400 --> 52:20.469
Hello.

52:58.541 --> 53:00.744
<i>Vámonos.</i>

53:02.546 --> 53:04.481
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

53:22.867 --> 53:24.535
<i>No! No!</i>

53:24.635 --> 53:26.705
<i>No!</i>

54:00.970 --> 54:05.608
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

54:06.110 --> 54:10.780
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

54:11.782 --> 54:16.419
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

54:17.021 --> 54:21.658
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

55:00.298 --> 55:02.231
Hey!

56:00.256 --> 56:02.059
No, no, no.

57:08.590 --> 57:10.494
No. No, no, no, no.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.698
Shh, shh, shh.

58:18.327 --> 58:19.863
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:38.815 --> 58:39.981
<i>Bueno.</i>

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:46.776
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:50.447
<i>Hello, I'm calling from
family first funeral service.</i>

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:53.616
<i>We wanted to let you know that
we've completed the process,</i>

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:57.287
<i>and you can pick up the
ashes at your convenience.</i>

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:15.505
Uncle Roy?

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:35.359
- Going for a ride?
- Looks that way.

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.828
Want some company?

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.398
No.

01:01:46.068 --> 01:01:48.303
No, I don't.

01:01:48.605 --> 01:01:51.507
But thank you, Kaye.

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:54.779
Thanks for offerin'.

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:06.321
You bring that pony back wet,
you'll catch hell from me. Understood?

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:08.793
Yes, ma'am.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:46.790
- What are you doin' up here?
- This is where the shooter was.

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:52.696
That's got to be well over 800 yards.
Are you sure it was from here?

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:57.933
I saw him from that bluff over there,
above the wash where Livy was killed.

01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:01.703
That's where I found these.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:06.743
- Roy...
- Found the leads down in the wash.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:10.180
Maybe you could match some of those up
with the lead in that body down there.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.849
Roy, you know you shouldn't...

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.919
You shouldn't have moved these.
Hell, you shouldn't even be up here.

01:09:16.019 --> 01:09:21.290
This is my land, Randall. Well,
somebody's got to do your job for you.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:25.093
Check 'em out. They're marked.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:29.163
Shooter must do his own reloads.

01:09:31.265 --> 01:09:33.303
Did you get a maker on the vehicle?

01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:36.975
No. Some kind of a
four by four. Green.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:43.380
Not many guys around
who can make that shot.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:47.283
Yeah, well, there's plenty of people pretty
angry about what happened to Livy, Roy.

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:51.785
Well, those people got no more business
bein' on my land than the damn Mexicans.

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:54.360
Randall...

01:09:55.286 --> 01:09:56.859
I want to talk to Ramirez.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.663
You know I can't allow that.
You're officially a civilian.

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:03.733
Besides, you're the spouse of the victim,
and that man is the prime suspect.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:06.302
- How's it gonna look...
- I spent over 25 years sittin'

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:09.973
in the same chair you park your
butt in now, the chair I put you in.

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:13.543
I know better than anybody that there's
a lot of things you can't do as sheriff,

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:16.746
but lettin' me talk to
Ramirez ain't one of 'em.

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.453
I have to...

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:12.968
You got five minutes.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.985
Jesus, Roy.

01:12:24.172 --> 01:12:25.974
Yeah.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:28.777
It figures.

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.186
No.

01:12:39.821 --> 01:12:41.458
<i>- ¿Carro?</i>
<i>- Si.</i>

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:42.690
No.

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:02.672
Oh, hi.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.474
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:07.043
That's okay. We've just
been here a few minutes.

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:08.945
- I'm Marily.
- Hi.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:10.480
How do you like the
front of the house?

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.881
- And the neighborhood?
- It's good.

01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:13.116
- Oh, good.
- Good.

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:15.652
I have the code to the garage,
and I can open the front door

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:18.254
and let myself in that way,
and then I can let you in.

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.757
Ah, there it is.

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:34.103
Oh-oh, my...

01:14:48.716 --> 01:14:50.753
Sean!

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:54.389
Sean!

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:57.226
Sean Louis Pat!

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.795
What?

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:01.598
Your dad wants to see
you in the garage!

01:15:01.698 --> 01:15:03.266
Why?

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.537
Why?

01:15:09.517 --> 01:15:13.576
- Why?
- But he said right now.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:34.528
Those were out on the ground off the
South Ridge of Roy McNary's land.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:38.301
And my .30-06 reloads.

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:40.903
I haven't been out
there huntin', son.

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:44.173
Besides, I always pick up my empties.

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:47.910
I even make a mark
on 'em with a sharpie,

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:52.914
just so I can tell
which ones are mine.

01:15:57.485 --> 01:16:00.054
Those are mine.

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:14.236
Any idea how they got out there, son?

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.007
What the hell were you thinking?
Was this your stupid idea?

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:19.909
Don't you turn your back on me!

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:23.078
Let me talk. Let me talk to him.

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:43.432
Well, the boys are tellin'
different stories.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:46.034
Two of 'em are sayin' that they
were shooting at the Mexicans...

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:48.805
'cause they were beating on Livy
and tryin' to steal her horse.

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:52.007
You know damned well
that's not what happened.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:54.909
Do I?

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:58.047
I mean, you thought those Mexicans
were beatin' on Livy too.

01:16:58.147 --> 01:17:01.818
I sat here and listened to you
tell me when you pulled up,

01:17:01.918 --> 01:17:04.220
that Mexican was trying
to steal Livy's horse.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.356
- Randall...
- That's what you said.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.894
What... what do we got here really?

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:16.199
Roy, I mean... so now we know that the
boys were shooting at the Mexicans.

01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:21.103
Livy didn't die of a gunshot
wound, Roy. That's a fact.

01:17:25.473 --> 01:17:28.609
He's my son, for God's sake.

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:32.213
Livy was my wife.

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:41.522
Who was the shooter?

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:45.293
Well, the boys are tellin'
different stories, and they're...

01:17:45.393 --> 01:17:48.731
- all trying to back each other...
- Randall.

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.869
Who was the shooter?

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.706
Sean.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.679
The shooter was Sean.

01:18:11.919 --> 01:18:13.991
- Flora, can it wait?
- Just thought both you sheriffs...

01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:16.826
might want to know that a lady called
over here just now and said she found

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:19.695
a bunch of illegals hiding
out in a garage in Phoenix.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:23.166
She said one of the illegals asked
her to call over here for her.

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:26.501
She said the woman is
Miguel Ramirez's wife.

01:19:07.976 --> 01:19:10.412
Melina Ramirez?

01:20:28.556 --> 01:20:32.060
<i>Si?</i> Flora?

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.600
Jesus. I'll call you
back in a minute.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.238
- Roy! Roy, you can't take her in there.
- Well, Flora and I just came by.

01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:19.208
- We, uh, both have to pee.
- Oh, stop! You can't take her in there!

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:20.543
No, no, don't.

01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:23.145
Miss Flora, she can't be in there.
You can't go in there.

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:25.848
Where are the boys at? Where's Sean?

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.582
Anybody but Ramirez been charged yet?

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:45.835
You know those boys
aren't flight risk.

01:21:45.935 --> 01:21:47.670
Now, they've been released
to their parents recognizance.

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:51.199
Well, that's a dumb idea since it was on
your and their parents recognizance...

01:21:51.299 --> 01:21:55.044
that the boys are out there poppin'
off rounds at people in the first place.

01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.642
- No, you tell them...
- Did you talk to the D.A. yet?

01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:01.381
You told him what's goin' on here?

01:23:01.481 --> 01:23:05.170
You told him about your
boy's involvement? Huh?

01:23:10.119 --> 01:23:11.420
No, no, no...

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.101
You go ahead and you
call him, and you tell him

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:28.968
how you tampered with
the damned evidence!

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:53.222
- Hello, Señor.
- <i>Hola.</i>

01:24:53.322 --> 01:24:57.925
Thank you for, uh,
bringing <i>mija</i> my house.

01:25:14.942 --> 01:25:16.977
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.022
Son-in-law.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.356
Oh, <i>si.</i>

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.900
<i>Bueno.</i>

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.982
- Evening.
- Good evening.

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:29.418
- Citizenship?
- American.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:32.486
- Do you have some I.D.?
- I do.

01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:35.557
- Roy?
- Edward.

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:37.226
Hi, Flora. How are you?

01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:39.762
Oh, good to see you, Edward.

01:26:39.862 --> 01:26:43.766
Hey, Roy, listen. I was really
sorry to hear about Livy.

01:26:45.768 --> 01:26:49.704
- What are you doing in Mexico?
- Droppin' off a friend.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.509
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:26:53.609 --> 01:26:55.976
Well, it was good to see you both.

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:58.179
Same here.

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:19.902
You can't walk in here and tell
me that Ramirez is without blame.

01:27:20.002 --> 01:27:23.071
I mean, none of this would have happened if
it hadn't been for those goddamn Mexicans

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:25.318
- walkin' across your land.
- None of this would have happened...

01:27:25.418 --> 01:27:29.042
if you'd changed the combination
on your goddamn gun locker.

01:27:36.083 --> 01:27:37.920
Okay, but you got to
do one thing for me.

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:42.358
Those boys got to pay for what
they did, Randall. Sean does too.

01:27:42.458 --> 01:27:44.882
I know that, and I know he does,
and he's gonna have to live with it...

01:27:44.982 --> 01:27:48.495
- for the rest of his life.
- So do I.

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:51.133
All I'm asking you...

01:27:51.735 --> 01:27:56.605
is that you say something on
his behalf at the deposition.

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:02.449
I'm asking you as a father,

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:05.410
and as a friend.

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:09.583
It was an accident.

01:28:10.185 --> 01:28:12.520
Randall...

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:19.226
The only way I will do that is if he tells
the truth about what happened out there.

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:21.630
He will.

01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:25.534
You know, being a
dumbass is no excuse.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:28.438
I know that.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.673
All right.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.615
Yours?

01:29:15.617 --> 01:29:18.054
Mine and my wife's.

01:29:34.503 --> 01:29:37.337
- Horse man.
- Oh, <i>si.</i>
