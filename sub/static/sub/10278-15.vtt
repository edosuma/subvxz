WEBVTT

00:04.140 --> 00:06.434
E. R.

00:06.435 --> 00:07.591
Previously on the E. R.

00:07.592 --> 00:09.485
So the baby's a girl today.

00:09.486 --> 00:10.937
You turned me in?

00:11.138 --> 00:13.836
There's a guy from the medical board
here, questioning my competency.

00:13.837 --> 00:16.730
Minority kids don't have the same
access to academic opportunities.

00:16.731 --> 00:17.684
You want to address that...

00:17.585 --> 00:21.012
...by advancing underqualified applicants
at the expense of our integrity and theirs?

00:21.013 --> 00:23.118
I want him to have an interview.

00:23.158 --> 00:25.796
Everyone deserves to be comforted
in their darkest hour.

00:25.797 --> 00:28.846
Too bad you weren't there to comfort
the little girl he killed.

00:28.847 --> 00:31.229
I didn't need to be. God was there.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.409
Was he?

00:32.409 --> 00:34.810
Bishop Stewart, can you hear me?

00:35.311 --> 00:37.195
Call 911.

00:43.568 --> 00:45.145
Again.

00:49.989 --> 00:52.658
It hurts when I breathe.
Could it be my heart?

00:52.825 --> 00:55.149
E. R. 7x15 "THE CROSSING"

00:55.327 --> 00:57.319
Something wrong?

00:57.495 --> 00:59.736
- Hey.
- What?

00:59.913 --> 01:03.246
- Is there something wrong with my heart?
- Probably a bruise to your chest wall.

01:03.416 --> 01:06.866
We'll get an x-ray to make sure.
You were lucky.

01:07.044 --> 01:10.910
We'll probably be sifting through
the walking wounded until morning...

01:11.088 --> 01:14.172
...but I think we're over the hump.
Carter brought up the last critical.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.673
- How many came in?
- Thirty-seven. Five in surgery.

01:17.843 --> 01:20.547
Only two ER deaths.
That's not too bad, considering.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.547
If you don't count the DOAs.

01:22.722 --> 01:25.722
You did a great job. You should
go home. We got it from here.

01:25.891 --> 01:27.930
- The board's backing up.
- We're fine. Go home.

01:28.101 --> 01:30.176
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.502 --> 02:06.791
Hey. You leaving?

02:07.630 --> 02:09.705
No, I thought I'd check on the bishop.

02:10.507 --> 02:15.049
- Another critical come in?
- No. That's it.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.796
Is she stable?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.923
- Yeah. After three rounds of terbutaline.
- Good.

02:20.097 --> 02:22.718
- It was scary, though.
- Yeah.

02:24.142 --> 02:26.679
So are you heading home soon?

02:27.936 --> 02:29.727
I don't know.

02:31.189 --> 02:32.469
You okay?

02:32.732 --> 02:34.558
Yeah.

02:55.582 --> 02:58.701
- Any change?
- He didn't want the breathing mask.

03:00.252 --> 03:02.742
- Has he been awake?
- Napping on and off.

03:15.096 --> 03:16.258
What time is it?

03:18.182 --> 03:19.379
11:30.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.058
You're here late.

03:21.893 --> 03:23.766
You'll have to be intubated soon.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.348
On a ventilator?

03:28.731 --> 03:32.016
Your oxygen level is down to 65
on 100% oxygen-

03:32.192 --> 03:34.861
I've seen what happens
after a ventilator.

03:35.194 --> 03:40.353
- If it drops below 50...
- Thanks. But no thanks.

03:42.116 --> 03:46.824
Anyway, my bags are packed.

03:52.624 --> 03:55.493
E. R.

04:42.202 --> 04:43.482
SEVEN HOURS EARLIER

04:43.661 --> 04:45.359
Water! I need water.

04:45.394 --> 04:47.053
- Mr. Martin!
- It stings!

04:47.228 --> 04:48.972
Mr. Martin, just give it a few seconds.

04:49.148 --> 04:50.178
No, it stings.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.813
- A few seconds and the pain will fade.
- Need some help?

04:52.985 --> 04:55.226
No. I just put in a drop of Alcaine.

04:55.403 --> 04:57.443
Mr. Martin fell asleep
under a tanning lamp.

04:57.614 --> 05:00.484
I wasn't tanning. I was depressed
due to lack of sunlight.

05:00.658 --> 05:03.149
Tell me about it.
Got back from lunch and it was dark.

05:03.328 --> 05:04.656
UTI in 4 is gone.

05:04.829 --> 05:07.320
- Groundhog see its shadow this year?
- Seeing his shadow...

05:07.498 --> 05:09.823
...has nothing to do
with how much sunlight we get.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.661
Yes, it does.
Six more weeks of winter.

05:11.836 --> 05:13.495
Seven-year-old with diarrhea
and wheezing.

05:13.671 --> 05:15.829
Ordered Solu-Medrol
and breathing treatments.

05:16.007 --> 05:17.631
- Any history of asthma?
- Nope.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.460
- Fever or cough?
- Nothing.

05:19.635 --> 05:22.505
- Carter, want to figure this one out?
- Bring it on.

05:22.679 --> 05:24.589
Okay, that's it. Weaver's on at 6:00.

05:24.765 --> 05:28.893
Could you tell her I'm finished testing
tonight so she can stop avoiding me?

05:29.061 --> 05:30.603
How'd your personality test go?

05:30.770 --> 05:33.855
I scored somewhere between
serial killer and talk-show host.

05:34.024 --> 05:36.479
- I thought they were memory tests.
- That was Monday.

05:36.651 --> 05:38.644
What's next, Rorschach? Spelling bee?

05:38.820 --> 05:41.393
Swimwear competition,
sudden-death Twister.

05:41.572 --> 05:43.482
Who knows? Maybe a chili cook-off.

05:43.658 --> 05:47.821
The needle goes in, but you can
squeeze on the owie ball. See that?

05:47.995 --> 05:49.158
- What's up?
- Hold that for me?

05:49.330 --> 05:52.035
Kid freaked out when
I tried to start an IV.

05:52.208 --> 05:55.042
- Who's...?
- She's a new intern for Pedes.

05:55.210 --> 05:58.247
- to give you medicine. And then
it won't hurt anymore, okay?

05:58.422 --> 06:02.040
Hey, Jason. I'm Dr. Carter. I understand
you're having some trouble breathing.

06:02.217 --> 06:03.497
- You mom?
- Yes.

06:03.677 --> 06:06.215
- Any history of asthma here?
- No.

06:06.388 --> 06:08.510
Mrs. Fabrone works as a
cleaning lady at a church.

06:08.681 --> 06:11.220
She found a bottle of holy water
in the sanctuary and thought...

06:11.393 --> 06:13.800
- ... it might help with Jason's diarrhea.
- Holy water?

06:14.146 --> 06:18.475
Only it tasted funny. When Jason started
coughing, she checked. It was lamp oil.

06:18.775 --> 06:23.069
- He aspirated holy oil?
- I guess so.

06:24.072 --> 06:27.072
That's the common duct.
We don't cut that. What time is it?

06:28.117 --> 06:30.690
-4:55.
- No, no, no. Your interview tomorrow.

06:30.869 --> 06:34.073
- Oh. 10:00 a. m.
- Get there by 9:30.

06:34.248 --> 06:36.204
Right.

06:36.416 --> 06:38.374
- So why do you want to be a doctor?
- What?

06:39.127 --> 06:42.082
- It's a common question in the interview.
- Oh, yeah.

06:42.256 --> 06:46.088
Clips. So, what's the answer?

06:46.260 --> 06:48.252
I wanna help people?

06:48.428 --> 06:50.087
No?

06:50.263 --> 06:55.340
All right. Now we dissect
the gallbladder from the liver.

06:55.518 --> 06:57.510
- What's the right answer?
- You tell me.

06:57.687 --> 06:58.801
The money?

07:00.106 --> 07:01.648
I wanna be a role model.

07:01.816 --> 07:04.568
- If you're not gonna take this seriously-
- I am. I just don't know.

07:04.902 --> 07:08.105
- I guess I always thought it'd be cool.
- Well, at least that's honest.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.154
- So I should say that?
- Of course not.

07:10.324 --> 07:12.316
Dr. Benton, how much
longer do you have?

07:12.492 --> 07:13.524
Are you timing me?

07:13.744 --> 07:15.653
Mass-cas called in.
They need you downstairs.

07:15.829 --> 07:17.787
- What happened?
- They didn't give details.

07:17.957 --> 07:21.407
All right. Let me get some more suction.
I'll be maybe 15 minutes.

07:22.169 --> 07:24.955
You should hang out.
You never know what you'll see.

07:25.129 --> 07:29.507
Great job, Jason. I'll stop by and see
you later, okay? You're admitting him?

07:29.675 --> 07:33.376
Yeah, just for a day. Keep him on
continuous nebs and monitor his sats.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.674
- Where's mom?
- She went to go talk to her priest.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.975
Could've used you, actually.
She got a little upset after you left.

07:40.144 --> 07:42.516
About her kid or because
she stole from the church?

07:42.788 --> 07:48.573
My friend used to lift communion wine
for us. He just went to confession.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.727
- What about you?
- Me? I just got sick.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.029
- So you're a heathen.
- Protestant.

07:54.199 --> 07:56.156
Is there a difference?

07:56.326 --> 07:58.319
- Will you sign this for me?
- What is it?

07:58.495 --> 08:01.910
It's for my supervisor. If you think
I did a good job with the kid.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.245
"Child Life Specialist."

08:03.417 --> 08:04.827
Intern. First day.

08:05.001 --> 08:07.327
Oh, yeah? Hey, welcome. John Carter.

08:07.879 --> 08:09.421
Rena Trujillo. Nice to meet you.

08:10.131 --> 08:11.459
And you.

08:12.842 --> 08:15.511
- Don't forget your voodoo doll.
- It's a procedure doll.

08:15.678 --> 08:17.836
They make them life-size
for really big kids?

08:18.097 --> 08:20.670
- Why, you lonely?
- Yeah. I work a lot.

08:20.849 --> 08:22.178
That's too bad.

08:22.351 --> 08:24.260
- John, Luka needs you.
- Abby, this is Rena.

08:24.478 --> 08:27.763
Hi. A train derailed by Lakeshore.
They need to set up a triage center.

08:28.273 --> 08:29.767
Excuse me.

08:30.484 --> 08:32.107
- Any passenger cars?
- Commuter train.

08:32.277 --> 08:33.557
- How many?
- They don't know.

08:33.736 --> 08:35.777
They're pulling bodies out.
They need docs on-site.

08:35.947 --> 08:39.530
Prep trauma rooms, set up Curtain 2
and 3 for majors. Pull everybody in.

08:39.701 --> 08:41.859
- Carter, let's go.
- Is the chopper already here?

08:42.035 --> 08:44.528
- They'll meet us on the roof.
- We don't have an Attending.

08:44.706 --> 08:47.196
Kerry's due in 15. Call me
if you have any problem.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.498
Four units of O-neg.

08:49.836 --> 08:52.622
Move all stable patients into the hall.
Double up the rooms.

08:52.797 --> 08:54.339
Anyone walking waits in Chairs.

08:54.507 --> 08:56.878
Put all surgical teams on alert
and notify the O.R.

08:57.050 --> 09:00.254
- Already did. We're low on vents.
- Then grab some from the ICU.

09:00.429 --> 09:03.216
- Found it.
- Randi, call the nursing supervisor...

09:03.390 --> 09:06.177
- ... float some nurses from the unit.
- They'll need them up there.

09:06.352 --> 09:08.427
- Get them from Med-Surg.
- Oh, my God.

09:39.341 --> 09:42.924
Captain Davis, incident commander.
We were evacuating the first car...

09:43.095 --> 09:46.594
...when it rolled. I got a man crushed
underneath. His legs are pinned.

09:46.765 --> 09:50.679
14 DOAs so far, we're still pulling them
out. Two middle cars are the worst.

09:50.852 --> 09:53.426
- What happened?
- An automobile stalled on the tracks.

09:53.605 --> 09:56.974
We think the brakes on the back cars
failed when the train tried to stop.

09:57.150 --> 10:00.186
Blunt chest trauma over here,
dropping his pressure!

10:00.361 --> 10:03.315
I've got it. You take the crush injury.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.443
- What's on the monitor?
- Sinus tach.

10:05.617 --> 10:08.024
- Vitals?
- BP, 90/60. Pulse is 120.

10:08.202 --> 10:10.872
I was supposed to fly.
My damn flight was canceled.

10:11.038 --> 10:12.283
Okay. Rales on the left.

10:12.456 --> 10:15.243
My chest.
Feels like something tore inside.

10:15.459 --> 10:17.914
Try a 14-gauge and bolus
a liter of saline.

10:18.086 --> 10:19.795
Mitch! Mitch, I'm sorry, man!

10:19.964 --> 10:21.339
Don't apologize to me.

10:21.506 --> 10:23.630
I didn't know it was
gonna tip over like that.

10:23.801 --> 10:26.967
BP, 85/60. Pulse, 110.

10:27.137 --> 10:30.802
- I need something more for the pain.
- What did you give him?

10:30.974 --> 10:33.465
Ten of morphine. Held off
when he dropped his pressure.

10:33.643 --> 10:35.968
Give him five more,
but after the liter.

10:39.399 --> 10:42.400
- How long till you can get him out?
- We couldn't lift it with the jacks-

10:42.569 --> 10:44.525
- How long?
- How long do you have?

10:44.737 --> 10:47.228
- Get a jack on this.
- That's not gonna hold.

10:47.406 --> 10:50.157
- She conscious?
- Yeah.

10:50.325 --> 10:53.030
- I'm Dr. Kovac. What's your name?
- I couldn't get out.

10:53.245 --> 10:55.487
- Your name? Do you know your name?
- Shannon.

10:55.664 --> 10:57.158
- Okay. Does your neck hurt?
- No.

10:57.332 --> 10:58.495
Hey, Luka!

11:00.044 --> 11:01.952
- What?
- We may need a surgeon.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.160
Call it in.

11:04.213 --> 11:06.669
We might not be able to get him out.
I need a surgeon...

11:06.841 --> 11:09.167
- ... with a field amputation kit.
- He's on stand-by.

11:09.344 --> 11:12.013
No, not on stand-by. Here now.
He's losing a lot of blood.

11:54.053 --> 11:56.046
Help.

11:57.431 --> 12:01.345
- Ma'am, has someone examined you?
- They're looking for my son.

12:01.519 --> 12:03.642
He wanted to go to the bathroom
by himself.

12:03.813 --> 12:06.303
- Okay, let's get you out.
- I can't move my legs.

12:06.481 --> 12:09.436
- Does your neck hurt?
- Please, you have to find my son.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.934
- Okay, lean forward.
- I can't!

12:15.073 --> 12:17.565
Doris!

12:17.743 --> 12:19.569
- Are you allergic to any medicines?
- No.

12:19.744 --> 12:22.117
- He's wearing a blue sweater.
- Doris!

12:22.289 --> 12:25.159
- In a sec!
- I need a line and a set of vitals!

12:25.333 --> 12:26.792
He's 7.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.415
He wanted to go
to the bathroom by himself.

12:29.587 --> 12:32.754
Saline, wide open. Nasal O-2,
and get me if she's hypotensive.

12:32.924 --> 12:35.759
Please, you have to find him!

12:41.057 --> 12:45.054
- Are you looking for a little boy?
- He's pinned. We have to cut him free.

12:45.269 --> 12:48.103
- Can you get a BP?
- No room. Pulse is thready.

12:48.271 --> 12:50.063
- How do I get in there?
- The roof.

12:50.232 --> 12:52.105
Systolic's 95.

12:52.275 --> 12:56.107
Make it two liters. Radio the IC.
I need the metal cut before we transport.

12:56.279 --> 12:57.940
- Did they find him?
- I think so.

12:58.115 --> 13:00.985
- Is he okay?
- I don't know yet.

13:01.159 --> 13:04.160
- What's his name?
- Myles.

13:25.307 --> 13:27.845
- Where is he?
- Over here.

13:45.410 --> 13:47.485
- Got an airway?
- Breathing on his own.

13:47.662 --> 13:50.413
We're waiting on a circular saw.

13:50.706 --> 13:54.538
Myles? Myles, can you hear me?

13:57.797 --> 14:01.581
Pupils, poorly reactive. Looks like a closed
head injury. We need to get him out.

14:01.801 --> 14:05.750
- I told you, equipment's on its way.
- Get it here, now!

14:24.614 --> 14:26.820
She's throwing PVCs.
Do you want us to treat?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.198
- What?
- Ectopic beats. Can we give lidocaine?

14:29.368 --> 14:31.076
- What's the injury?
- Train hit her car.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.661
- Possible pubic ramus fracture.
- Not at her age. Just get her to County.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.824
- Where's the amputation?
- Over here.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.914
We've got a crush injury to the legs.
BP's 90/65 with fluids.

14:41.087 --> 14:42.997
I don't know how much longer
we can keep it that way.

14:43.173 --> 14:47.800
- They can't get him out?
- They're trying to, but...

14:49.262 --> 14:52.714
- You all right? You okay?
- Damn it.

14:53.516 --> 14:56.008
I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:57.687 --> 14:59.229
- What's his name?
- Who?

14:59.397 --> 15:01.306
- The firefighter.
- Lorcan.

15:01.524 --> 15:05.308
I had to inflate two BP cuffs to use
as tourniquets. Watch your step.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.060
- Right.
- You okay?

15:08.238 --> 15:09.614
Yes.

15:09.782 --> 15:13.364
Lorcan, I'm Elizabeth Corday.
I'm a surgeon.

15:13.535 --> 15:15.243
You gonna cut them off?

15:15.412 --> 15:17.700
Only if I have to. Now, listen.

15:17.872 --> 15:20.708
We can't give you more pain medication
because we need to keep...

15:20.876 --> 15:23.746
...your blood pressure up.
So I'm going to give you a nerve block.

15:23.921 --> 15:25.083
Do it fast.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.164
Prep the groin area. Betadine.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.831
- How much fluid in?
- Three liters saline, two of O-neg.

15:30.051 --> 15:32.009
20-gauge for the injection.

15:32.179 --> 15:35.629
These cuffs aren't holding. I'm gonna
reinflate them and then clamp them.

15:35.806 --> 15:37.764
- Lorcan, you want me to call Patty?
- No!

15:37.934 --> 15:39.807
- You sure?
- I'm not dying, man.

15:40.019 --> 15:42.557
- All right, buddy.
- Who's Patty?

15:42.772 --> 15:44.182
Patty's my ex-wife.

15:44.398 --> 15:47.269
Guys and I were going out after the shift
to celebrate my divorce going through.

15:47.443 --> 15:50.693
- Get back. We're gonna hammer through.
- Just a second!

15:50.905 --> 15:53.110
- Come on, let's do this!
- Hold on, Lorcan.

15:53.281 --> 15:54.657
Get me out!

15:54.825 --> 15:56.319
Got it?

15:56.535 --> 15:59.072
- Done.
- Thanks.

16:07.962 --> 16:08.994
That's it!

16:09.172 --> 16:13.419
Okay, on three. One, two, three...

16:18.389 --> 16:21.889
- Where's the backboard?
- Paramedics are bringing it in.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.887
All right.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.682
Is he still breathing?

16:31.860 --> 16:35.026
- Yes. Good air entry.
- How many did you say we could take?

16:35.196 --> 16:37.273
I didn't. They're transporting
all over the city.

16:37.449 --> 16:39.441
We're two docs down
and a surgeon in the field.

16:39.617 --> 16:42.702
- You want me to page Dr. Greene?
- He's at his competency testing.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.531
Find out how many they're sending us.

16:44.706 --> 16:47.457
Malucci's on his way with the
first air-evac. Possible aortic rupture.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.036
- Peter, you're up first.
- Got it.

16:49.211 --> 16:50.953
No, elevator. Call CT.

16:51.129 --> 16:54.295
Have them cancel all elective cases.
I don't want them jamming up on us.

16:54.465 --> 16:57.134
Stay close to me.
If you have any questions, ask.

16:57.301 --> 17:01.678
Don't be surprised if the nurses push
you out of the way. It's their job.

17:01.847 --> 17:03.840
- I don't need to stay?
- Only if you want to.

17:04.016 --> 17:06.137
Blunt chest trauma, asymmetric BPs.

17:06.309 --> 17:09.180
Dropped his pressure en route.
60 palp. Tachy at 120.

17:09.354 --> 17:11.893
- Sir, do you know where you are?
- I was taking a plane.

17:12.066 --> 17:15.185
- Oriented times one only.
- Marked tachypnea. Pulse ox, 88.

17:15.359 --> 17:16.855
- Heart sounds muffled.
- What's that mean?

17:17.029 --> 17:19.648
- Trashed his aorta.
- The major artery from the heart.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.945
- Neck veins are distended.
- He's in tamponade.

17:22.157 --> 17:23.486
Have the O.R. prime bypass.

17:23.660 --> 17:25.818
- You our new third-year?
- No, I'm just applying.

17:25.996 --> 17:27.821
Come on. Get over here.

17:27.997 --> 17:30.323
- Move!
- Let's prep for pericardiocentesis.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.698
Too late. Lost the pulse.

17:33.127 --> 17:36.827
Thoracotomy tray. You better put on
a gown. It's gonna get bloody in here.

17:39.217 --> 17:41.173
- What do you got?
- Abdominal wound.

17:41.343 --> 17:43.550
BP's 120/90.
We're taking her to Lakeshore.

17:43.721 --> 17:47.468
Are you kidding me? She needs a trauma
center. All right. Reroute to County.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.346
- Give her 10 more of MS. Do it!
- We're supposed to rotate-

17:50.519 --> 17:51.977
- Doc! Doc!
- Yeah?

17:52.145 --> 17:54.719
Tracheal shift to the left.
I need to stick him.

17:55.398 --> 17:58.150
- What's his pulse ox?
-88 on high-flow O-2.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.186
I can't hear anything with all this noise.

18:04.365 --> 18:05.527
Did you get it?

18:06.743 --> 18:08.699
I don't know.

18:12.248 --> 18:14.619
- Are these all ours?
- No, it's the damn news.

18:15.125 --> 18:17.201
Okay, he's moving air.
Take him to County.

18:17.378 --> 18:20.581
Not Lakeshore. County. Tell them
he needs a chest tube, maybe a vent.

18:24.050 --> 18:25.593
Stop! Stop!

18:25.761 --> 18:28.251
- You okay?
- I think I may have strained my back.

18:28.471 --> 18:29.883
Come on! Keep digging!

18:30.057 --> 18:32.179
We can't. The weight of the train
will shift on you.

18:32.350 --> 18:33.809
- That crane coming?
- From Indiana.

18:33.977 --> 18:35.850
- What?!
- It's on its way, Lorcan.

18:36.020 --> 18:37.051
What's his pressure?

18:37.146 --> 18:39.388
85 palp. Pulse 110. Four units in.

18:40.817 --> 18:42.940
- Can you assist?
- Yeah. I can start.

18:43.153 --> 18:48.194
Lorcan, listen to me. I'm gonna have to
proceed with amputating both your legs.

18:48.366 --> 18:51.401
No! I've had people trapped
for hours before we got them out!

18:51.619 --> 18:54.288
I appreciate that.
But you've lost too much blood.

18:54.455 --> 18:58.155
If I don't amputate and control
the bleeding, you're going to die.

18:59.292 --> 19:02.496
Okay, then. I'm gonna start.

19:02.754 --> 19:06.455
Do you understand? I have to start now.

19:08.093 --> 19:09.586
Prep the area.

19:10.929 --> 19:11.960
10 blade.

19:19.270 --> 19:20.645
Can you tell my fortune with these?

19:20.813 --> 19:24.432
Pick up each card from your pile and put
it under the card to which it belongs.

19:24.609 --> 19:25.771
Is that the death card?

19:25.943 --> 19:29.526
I'll tell you if you're right or wrong.
Are you ready to begin?

19:29.697 --> 19:32.104
- Hit me.
- Begin.

19:33.284 --> 19:37.032
No. No, just try the next card.

19:39.122 --> 19:41.874
No.

19:42.126 --> 19:45.328
- Yes.
- Third one's a charm.

19:45.503 --> 19:47.330
Yes.

19:48.339 --> 19:49.798
Yes.

19:49.966 --> 19:52.042
- Yes.
- Look, two hands.

19:52.218 --> 19:53.878
Yes.

19:54.053 --> 19:55.299
- No.
- No?

19:55.513 --> 19:56.628
No.

20:00.143 --> 20:01.257
No.

20:01.811 --> 20:04.432
- Ever say anything besides yes or no?
- No.

20:09.235 --> 20:13.446
I've isolated the femoral artery.
Retract distally.

20:13.614 --> 20:16.104
- Got some oozing from the SFA.
- Mitch?

20:16.283 --> 20:20.031
- Can't do much about that in the field.
- Mitch!

20:20.203 --> 20:24.035
- I'm right here, buddy.
- I think maybe you should get Patty.

20:24.374 --> 20:28.917
- You got it.
- I need to dissect this vessel out. Metz.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.168
- What? What is it?
- Carter, quick. Clamp that. Clamp it.

20:35.342 --> 20:39.008
- What, what, what, what?
- Medial to the muscle bed. Clamp it now.

20:39.180 --> 20:42.134
- Is it your back?
- It's coming and going.

20:42.349 --> 20:45.516
- Intermittent pain?
- Yes.

20:45.686 --> 20:47.844
How often?

20:48.647 --> 20:50.687
- What's her pressure?
- Dropping. 80 palp.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.858
- Myles.
- Start her on dopamine. Titrate to 100.

20:54.028 --> 20:55.438
Save him, please.

20:55.612 --> 20:58.697
- How long till you are through?
- I don't know. Ten minutes, maybe.

21:03.537 --> 21:05.114
Pupils are still sluggish.

21:05.288 --> 21:07.446
Okay. 0.3 of atropine.
Do you have any mannitol?

21:07.624 --> 21:09.700
- On board.
- Hang 40 grams.

21:09.876 --> 21:13.209
- He's hypertensive and bradying down.
- I know.

21:13.379 --> 21:15.585
He could have a bleed.
You're not coming with us?

21:18.426 --> 21:22.293
Okay, load him. I'll be right back.

21:25.724 --> 21:28.678
Carter, I have to take this boy in.
There is a woman back there...

21:28.852 --> 21:32.138
...impaled, with spinal shock. And I want
you to stay with... What is it?

21:32.314 --> 21:33.891
- She's having contractions.
- What?!

21:34.107 --> 21:38.401
- She's having contractions at 25 weeks.
- I need tocolytics and a fetal monitor.

21:38.569 --> 21:41.239
I can keep on going
if I can just get them to stop.

21:41.448 --> 21:42.692
- Have any terbutaline?
- No.

21:42.865 --> 21:44.111
- In the rig?
- We don't carry it.

21:44.326 --> 21:47.824
You should fly back with us. Carter, take
the mother. The woman down there.

21:48.037 --> 21:50.196
What about him?
We opened the interior compartment.

21:50.415 --> 21:52.288
- Call another surgeon!
- We're out of O-neg.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.166
We have to finish him now.

21:54.335 --> 21:57.834
If we put you on the chopper, could you
monitor this boy on the flight back?

21:58.005 --> 22:00.922
Yes. But he could exsanguinate
from his left leg.

22:01.133 --> 22:04.584
- You were a surgical resident, yeah?
- Interned. For a year.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.933
- Trauma panel and get a HemoCue.
- Sinus, rate of 95.

22:12.102 --> 22:13.644
- Any chest pain?
- No.

22:13.812 --> 22:17.430
Mild guarding. No rebound.
Set her up for a CT and put in a Foley.

22:17.607 --> 22:20.144
- Is that man from the train?
- Yeah.

22:20.318 --> 22:21.481
- Is he dying?
- I don't know.

22:21.694 --> 22:24.945
Abby, could you shut the doors?
Type and cross for four. Dip a urine.

22:25.115 --> 22:27.273
More O-neg on the infuser.
The heart's not filling.

22:27.450 --> 22:29.277
- Unit seven going up.
- Got it. Cut.

22:29.452 --> 22:32.369
- Okay, you're done. We gotta shock him.
- Hold on. Couple more sutures.

22:32.538 --> 22:34.447
Dr. Benton, Dr. Finch needs you.
Bad leg injury.

22:34.665 --> 22:35.945
Got it.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.453
Clear!

22:37.626 --> 22:39.833
Malucci, he's all yours.
You get a rhythm, send him up.

22:40.004 --> 22:42.126
- White, you're coming with me.
- Still in V-fib.

22:42.297 --> 22:45.084
Another amp of epi.
Stand by with lidocaine. Clear.

22:45.592 --> 22:48.166
Peter, I have a right orbital trauma
with loss of vision.

22:48.345 --> 22:50.835
Set up the slit lamp,
tetracaine and fluorescein.

22:51.014 --> 22:53.968
Dr. Benton, blunt abdominal trauma.
Possible liver injury.

22:54.142 --> 22:56.515
- What's the crit?
- Thirty-four, but he's pretty tender.

22:56.687 --> 22:59.805
- Do an ultrasound. If you see fluid-
- Chuny, I need vitals now.

22:59.981 --> 23:02.816
- Traumatic extrusion of the tibia.
- You call Ortho?

23:02.984 --> 23:05.771
- Yes, but he's looking pretty dusky.
- Hold on, that's my bone!

23:05.987 --> 23:09.071
All right. All the major vessels
seem intact. Just try to get him up.

23:09.281 --> 23:11.986
- Peter, Carter needs to talk to you.
- Not now!

23:12.201 --> 23:14.027
He's performing a double
amputation by himself.

23:14.202 --> 23:15.828
- What?!
- A guy pinned under a train.

23:15.996 --> 23:18.569
- Don't worry. That can be reattached.
- Give another 20 MS.

23:18.748 --> 23:21.204
Okay, he's on Bravo Three.

23:21.668 --> 23:24.504
- Carter, what are you doing?
- Left anterior thigh.

23:24.713 --> 23:27.120
I've incised through the fascia
and muscle planes.

23:27.298 --> 23:29.457
I need to isolate
the neurovascular bundle.

23:29.676 --> 23:32.001
- I thought Corday went with you.
- She did.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.210
What is she doing?

23:33.430 --> 23:35.221
We've got to control his airway.

23:35.390 --> 23:39.174
BP's rocketing, 240/120.
Pulse, down to 30.

23:39.352 --> 23:42.935
Another mig of atropine
and mix Nipride.

23:43.106 --> 23:48.396
- He's in respiratory distress.
- I'll intubate. 6.5 ET tube.

23:48.569 --> 23:52.187
- Should we stay on the ground?
- No, let's go.

23:52.364 --> 23:56.196
Fifty of lido, one of Pavulon, 50 of sux.

23:56.285 --> 23:58.076
You okay?

23:58.245 --> 24:00.321
No.

24:17.555 --> 24:21.137
Using the dull edge of the Metz, let
your finger continue blunt dissection...

24:21.308 --> 24:24.226
...of the artery from
the neurovascular bundle.

24:24.395 --> 24:28.808
- What?
- Blunt dissection-

24:29.316 --> 24:32.483
You' re gonna have to shout.
I can barely hear you.

24:32.653 --> 24:36.437
Do you know what you' re doing?
Does anybody know what they' re doing?!

24:40.827 --> 24:42.108
What's he down to now?

24:42.204 --> 24:44.824
190/100. Pulse, 44 after two migs.

24:44.997 --> 24:47.915
- Try 80 of Lasix.
- Let them take him downstairs.

24:48.084 --> 24:50.457
Go! Go straight to CT.

24:50.629 --> 24:53.084
There's a case on the table.

24:53.256 --> 24:56.921
- He probably has an epidural.
- I'll tell him.

24:57.093 --> 25:00.877
- How often you been having back pain?
- Every four or five minutes.

25:01.180 --> 25:03.172
When's the last time
you felt the baby move?

25:05.101 --> 25:07.591
I don't know. I haven't.

25:08.437 --> 25:09.600
Okay.

25:10.647 --> 25:12.605
Got it!

25:13.275 --> 25:16.026
Can you call on the radio
and see how he is?

25:16.194 --> 25:21.152
- We'll be there soon.
- BP, 96/65. Pulse is 110.

25:22.159 --> 25:25.693
Am I gonna die? Am I?

25:25.870 --> 25:26.985
We'll get you out.

25:27.163 --> 25:31.375
If I die before I get there, you have to
make sure they take care of Myles.

25:32.210 --> 25:33.538
- They will.
- He's 7.

25:33.711 --> 25:34.742
I know.

25:34.920 --> 25:40.723
His father's in Kansas City on business.
We were coming back from visiting him.

25:41.093 --> 25:43.797
I thought it'd be fun
for Myles to take the train.

25:43.970 --> 25:45.631
What about the sciatic nerve?

25:45.806 --> 25:48.723
Pull it down as far as possible,
then apply an Ochsner clamp.

25:49.977 --> 25:52.432
That one. Third to the right.

25:53.354 --> 25:54.683
Okay. I got it. Now what?

25:54.856 --> 25:57.394
Put a second clamp
five millimeters distally.

25:58.985 --> 26:02.104
We' re gonna get you through this,
Lorcan. You're gonna be all right.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.446
Remove the proximal clamp
and ligate the crushed area.

26:05.616 --> 26:08.321
-0-Vicryl?
- No, no, no. Nonabsorbable.

26:08.494 --> 26:12.824
- Peter, this boy's herniating.
- Use silk if you've got it.

26:12.999 --> 26:16.202
- Okay. Done that. Now what?
- We've got to drain the hematoma.

26:16.377 --> 26:18.168
Carter, I've gotta go.
Call me on your cell phone.

26:18.337 --> 26:20.459
- I don't have it. It's in my locker.
- Find one.

26:20.630 --> 26:23.797
- Peter, now. Keep bagging him.
- What do I do about this nerve?

26:23.967 --> 26:26.423
- Step off in the right parietal region.
- Dr. Benton?

26:26.595 --> 26:29.085
- Pulse ox is dropping.
- Dr. Benton?!

26:29.472 --> 26:31.264
- What is it?
- You have a cell phone?

26:31.433 --> 26:33.176
- Do you?
- No.

26:33.351 --> 26:36.352
- Terbutaline's on board.
- Repeat in another hour.

26:36.521 --> 26:39.522
- You sure McLucas hasn't answered?
- We just paged her. Give her a second.

26:39.691 --> 26:41.315
- What about Mark?
- He's on his way.

26:41.484 --> 26:46.395
Okay. You're about 25% effaced.
But dimpled, not dilated.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.898
- Okay? We can control that.
- You think so?

26:49.075 --> 26:51.744
- An OB Resident's on his way.
- I don't want a Resident!

26:51.910 --> 26:54.484
You have to calm down.
And focus, okay?

26:54.663 --> 26:57.036
- Give the terbutaline a chance to work.
- Mark's on the phone.

26:57.208 --> 26:59.165
- What line?
- Three.

26:59.918 --> 27:02.623
- Climbing again, 220/115.
- Blown right pupil.

27:02.796 --> 27:04.872
He needs a burr hole.
Where's your perforating drill?

27:05.048 --> 27:06.875
- Is 1 open?
- Yeah. Malucci's calling it.

27:07.050 --> 27:10.300
Connect the chisel bit. Let's keep
hyperventilating. Let's move!

27:10.470 --> 27:12.842
- Coming through!
- Hold on. I gotta move this guy out.

27:13.014 --> 27:15.221
No, no, no. Shove him up
against the wall. Move!

27:15.392 --> 27:17.882
Have somebody shave his head.
Give me 8.5 gloves.

27:18.061 --> 27:20.303
Sit him up to 30 degrees.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.602
Carter's on line three.
He needs to talk to you.

27:22.773 --> 27:25.728
White, get over here and hold
the phone up to my ear. 10 blade.

27:25.902 --> 27:29.816
- Pressure's through the roof, 260/140.
- Not good. Up the Nipride to three mics.

27:29.989 --> 27:32.610
Put my glasses down.
Carter, talk to me. Where are you?

27:32.783 --> 27:35.700
- Sciatic nerve.
- All right, good. Cut proximally...

27:35.911 --> 27:38.402
...and let the muscle retract
into the muscle belly.

27:38.581 --> 27:40.988
Lorcan, they found Patty.
They' re gonna send a truck...

27:41.166 --> 27:43.918
- ... to take her straight to the hospital.
- No, no. Forget it.

27:44.086 --> 27:45.248
Okay. Cutting now.

27:45.420 --> 27:47.911
Good. Make sure you use
a scalpel instead of scissors.

27:48.090 --> 27:51.755
- Otherwise you'll get a neuroma.
- She's on her way. She wants to come.

27:51.927 --> 27:54.417
- No! No! Not now!
- Would you please hold him still?!

27:55.012 --> 27:57.338
- Okay, now what?
- Take two Kellys...

27:57.515 --> 28:00.600
...and clamp the femoral artery
and vein together.

28:00.810 --> 28:03.764
- I don't want her to see me like this!
- Can you give him something?

28:03.979 --> 28:06.103
- He's seizing!
- Five of Ativan.

28:06.566 --> 28:08.308
Five of Valium.
Put the phone right here.

28:08.484 --> 28:09.765
I don't want her to see me!

28:09.944 --> 28:12.897
- You gotta hold him still until it kicks in.
- You're almost free.

28:13.113 --> 28:16.363
- Is that two clamps each or altogether?
- Two clamps altogether!

28:16.575 --> 28:17.689
- Two of Ativan?
- Five.

28:18.284 --> 28:20.443
Am I clamping the vein
and the artery separately?

28:20.662 --> 28:22.987
Carter, clamp the vessels
as one unit at both ends.

28:23.165 --> 28:25.287
Ativan's on board. Still seizing.

28:25.500 --> 28:29.367
All right. You know what?
I gotta go in. Just reparalyze him.

28:29.587 --> 28:32.293
- Both proximally...
- Don't do it!

28:32.507 --> 28:35.958
- ... and distally or one proximally-?
- Carter, just clamp the damn vessels!

28:38.262 --> 28:41.216
- How many liters in?
- Two and a half. Lost a pulse.

28:41.391 --> 28:44.177
- She's in V-fib. Charge to 200.
- Do you want to run her inside?

28:44.351 --> 28:46.973
No, here. Paddles.

28:47.855 --> 28:49.977
Charging.

28:51.609 --> 28:52.889
Clear!

28:53.068 --> 28:56.318
- Still in V-fib.
- Charge to 300. Clear.

28:56.488 --> 28:59.822
Mark, penetrating back injury.
Needs to go straight to the O.R.

28:59.992 --> 29:02.529
All right, I'll tell Randi.

29:07.415 --> 29:09.408
Mark.

29:09.709 --> 29:11.950
- You feeling any more contractions?
- I'm sorry.

29:12.128 --> 29:13.160
Don't be.

29:13.338 --> 29:16.089
I slipped and fell.
I thought it was just backache.

29:16.257 --> 29:18.464
- Did you give her terbutaline?
- Ten minutes ago.

29:18.634 --> 29:19.915
Fetal heart tones?

29:20.094 --> 29:22.003
One fifty-five. No decels.

29:22.095 --> 29:23.127
Well, that's good.

29:23.222 --> 29:26.637
- They haven't stopped.
- You gotta give it some time to work.

29:26.809 --> 29:28.801
Or maybe we should try magnesium.

29:29.019 --> 29:33.348
We will if we have to. Okay?
Let's just wait and see.

29:34.733 --> 29:38.481
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.018
- Irrigate.
- More Ativan?

29:40.196 --> 29:42.687
No. Stopped seizing once he relieved
intercranial pressure.

29:42.866 --> 29:46.365
Suction catheter. Carter,
are you through the tibia yet?

29:46.870 --> 29:48.494
Done. Almost there, Lorcan.

29:48.663 --> 29:51.533
Good. Use the rongeur
to bevel the anterior apex.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.950
- Where is that?
- Sharp edge at the end of the bone.

29:54.127 --> 29:56.000
- What's his pressure?
- Down to 170/60.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.703
They' re all sharp! Damn it!

29:58.923 --> 30:01.378
- It's the anterior surface.
- Dr. Weaver, I need you.

30:01.592 --> 30:03.715
- What patient?
- The girl whose car got hit.

30:03.928 --> 30:06.050
- I'm sorry. What?
- The anterior surface.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.677
- Get him upstairs.
- Carter, you're almost there.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.055
When you're done, use the
rongeur to crack the fibula.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.806
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold on! Hold on!

30:13.979 --> 30:16.350
Dr. Benton!

30:16.522 --> 30:18.811
Dr. Benton!

30:19.234 --> 30:20.514
Good luck.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.148
BP's low. Want me to put
the dopamine back on?

30:24.322 --> 30:26.991
- Hold the elevator!
- No. This one goes straight up.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.909
- Status, post-cardiac arrest.
- I just opened up this kid's head.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.615
Did you evacuate the clot?

30:33.831 --> 30:37.615
- There's still active bleeding at the site.
- She's in shock. Lucky he got her back.

30:37.835 --> 30:39.413
All right, go.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.085
No. Take the boy first.

30:42.589 --> 30:44.582
Call Neurosurg, tell them
we're on our way.

30:44.758 --> 30:46.916
I need two units of FFP
and an ICP monitor.

30:47.093 --> 30:48.256
Eighty-five palp.

30:48.929 --> 30:50.091
Start the dopamine.

30:54.684 --> 30:58.516
- What is it?
- I wanted to ask you something. He die?

30:58.688 --> 31:00.764
- Who?
- That man.

31:00.940 --> 31:03.811
They cut open his chest,
but he died.

31:03.985 --> 31:07.152
- Yes. He had a fatal injury.
- What about the boy?

31:07.322 --> 31:08.946
He went up to surgery.

31:09.115 --> 31:12.282
- Is he going to die?
- I don't know.

31:13.786 --> 31:17.369
Is there someone we can call for you?
Your mom or dad?

31:17.540 --> 31:19.247
They won't understand.

31:20.334 --> 31:21.614
Won't understand what?

31:23.670 --> 31:28.379
I thought it would be painless.
The train would hit my car...

31:28.550 --> 31:31.006
...I'd just be gone.

31:49.070 --> 31:52.106
Yeah, don't talk to me about saturated.
You haven't seen saturated.

31:52.281 --> 31:54.320
Chuny, I need a trauma panel.
What's open?

31:54.491 --> 31:56.234
I don't care. I'm admitting them!

31:56.410 --> 31:59.364
- Carter, they're holding O.R. 6-
- I was just there. No surgeon.

31:59.538 --> 32:00.866
- Is he stable?
- Yeah...

32:01.040 --> 32:02.996
...but I had to sedate him
with 10 of Valium.

32:03.166 --> 32:04.411
- Carter, are you deaf?
- What?

32:04.584 --> 32:06.542
I keep shouting, you keep
getting on the elevator?

32:06.712 --> 32:09.581
- Is this the pre-op amputation?
- This is the post-op amputation.

32:09.756 --> 32:12.461
What, in the field?
What did they use, a chain saw?

32:12.634 --> 32:14.507
- Dr. Benton talked me through-
- You did this?

32:14.678 --> 32:15.757
There was nobody else-

32:15.929 --> 32:19.096
Well, by all means, let's get whoever's
available. You ought to try it next time.

32:19.266 --> 32:22.135
- Maybe if you'd respond to your page-
- I can't wear my pager in the dojo.

32:22.309 --> 32:25.513
Brenda knew where I was.
Should have called her. Let's go.

32:25.688 --> 32:28.642
Dr. Weaver, flail chest in 4 just
dropped his pulse ox down to 81.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.191
Carter, can you take this?

32:30.359 --> 32:34.024
- Yeah, give him another one. I'll clean up.
- Maybe I should have just let him die.

32:34.196 --> 32:35.690
- Good work, Carter.
- I know.

32:35.864 --> 32:37.987
Really. He was lucky
that you were out there.

32:38.158 --> 32:40.364
- Thank you. I'm coming!
- Carter!

32:40.535 --> 32:42.030
- Kerry?
- Yeah.

32:42.204 --> 32:44.825
- You have a suicidal ideation?
- Young girl in Trauma 2.

32:44.998 --> 32:47.571
- Does she have a plan?
- Parked her car in front of a train.

32:47.751 --> 32:50.455
- I suppose that qualifies.
- She's also in a major depression.

32:50.628 --> 32:52.621
- Flat affect?
- No real remorse.

32:52.797 --> 32:55.334
- About the suicide attempt?
- For the train wreck.

32:55.508 --> 32:56.706
Oh, my.

32:59.094 --> 33:02.629
- Think you're gonna get off before 12?
- Probably not.

33:03.265 --> 33:04.296
Okay.

33:05.726 --> 33:09.261
- I'll try to be quiet.
- No. Wake me.

33:10.898 --> 33:12.689
Something wrong?

33:12.858 --> 33:14.269
Hey.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.317
- What?
- There something wrong with my heart?

33:17.487 --> 33:20.322
Probably a bruise to your chest wall.
We'll get an x-ray to make sure.

33:20.490 --> 33:22.233
- You were lucky.
- We're still sifting through...

33:22.408 --> 33:24.448
...the walking wounded,
but we're over the hump.

33:24.619 --> 33:27.371
- Carter just took the last critical.
- How many came in?

33:27.539 --> 33:31.156
Thirty-seven. Five up in surgery.
Only two ER deaths.

33:31.333 --> 33:34.169
- That's not bad, considering.
- If you don't count the DOAs.

33:34.337 --> 33:37.124
You did great work today.
You should go home. We got it.

33:37.298 --> 33:39.623
- Board's backing up.
- That's all right. Go home.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.425
- Shirley called for you.
- What?

33:41.594 --> 33:45.176
O.R. nurse. You asked her to call when
the mom and son came out of surgery.

33:45.348 --> 33:47.055
- Did they?
- Yeah. They're in Recovery.

33:47.224 --> 33:50.510
Mom's got sensation in her legs,
and the kid's neurologically intact.

33:50.686 --> 33:54.553
- That's good, right?
- Yeah. That's good.

34:06.492 --> 34:08.367
You still here?

34:08.536 --> 34:11.572
The nurses put me to work,
thought I was a volunteer or something.

34:11.746 --> 34:15.496
Good. Now you've got an experience
to talk about in your interview.

34:15.668 --> 34:18.835
- I don't know.
- It's yours. You might as well use it.

34:19.588 --> 34:24.215
- I mean, I don't know if I want to.
- Want to what?

34:24.384 --> 34:26.259
What I saw tonight...

34:26.429 --> 34:29.382
Most people go their whole lives
without seeing stuff like that.

34:29.556 --> 34:34.099
Drilling into a little boy's head.
Guys having their legs cut off.

34:34.268 --> 34:38.562
- People dying right in front of you.
- You get used to it.

34:38.773 --> 34:42.308
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

34:42.694 --> 34:46.063
- But thanks for helping me find out early.
- Go to the interview.

34:46.489 --> 34:49.360
- Dr. Benton-
- You may feel differently in a few days.

34:50.076 --> 34:52.862
- I know, but-
- Hey, give yourself options.

34:58.584 --> 34:59.699
Anything?

34:59.877 --> 35:04.622
No contractions since the third round.
Fetal heart rate looks good.

35:04.798 --> 35:07.634
- So it's over.
- Aside from bed rest.

35:07.801 --> 35:10.043
How long do you think?

35:10.220 --> 35:13.174
You can catch me up on my soaps.

35:13.348 --> 35:14.842
It'll be okay.

35:16.101 --> 35:20.180
When I felt the baby move before,
obviously I knew it was in there, but...

35:20.354 --> 35:24.518
- Suddenly this feels real, you know?
- Yes, Mom.

35:24.692 --> 35:27.776
OB's waiting, and Transpo promises
they'll be down soon to take you up.

35:27.987 --> 35:29.779
- Thanks, Abby.
- The monitor stays on...

35:29.948 --> 35:33.031
- ...for at least 24 hours.
- I'll keep it on until I give birth.

35:33.242 --> 35:36.196
You just have to slow down.
No more helicopters.

35:36.912 --> 35:38.739
Right.

35:43.836 --> 35:46.077
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:46.671 --> 35:50.171
- You leaving?
- No. I thought I'd check on the bishop.

35:51.342 --> 35:54.842
- Another critical come in?
- No. That's it.

35:56.430 --> 35:57.629
Is she stable?

35:58.183 --> 36:01.433
- Yeah. After three rounds of terbutaline.
- Good.

36:01.645 --> 36:03.601
- Yeah. It was scary, though.
- Yeah.

36:03.771 --> 36:06.097
You heading home soon?

36:06.524 --> 36:07.804
I don't know.

36:09.568 --> 36:13.067
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:26.001 --> 36:29.500
- Any change?
- He didn't want the breathing mask.

36:29.671 --> 36:33.039
- Has he been awake?
- Napping on and off.

36:40.973 --> 36:42.349
What time is it?

36:43.851 --> 36:47.055
-11:30.
- You're here late.

36:47.230 --> 36:51.441
- You'll have to be intubated soon.
- On a ventilator?

36:52.735 --> 36:56.353
Your oxygen level is down to 65
on 100% oxygen.

36:56.530 --> 36:58.855
I've seen what happens
after the ventilator.

36:59.074 --> 37:03.023
- If it drops below 50-
- Thanks, but no thanks.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.577
Anyway...

37:06.665 --> 37:08.372
...my bags are packed.

37:14.005 --> 37:15.380
How long do I have?

37:17.383 --> 37:18.498
Maybe hours.

37:19.927 --> 37:23.012
- Then I'd better hear it now.
- Hear what?

37:23.181 --> 37:26.264
- Your confession.
- Bishop, I don't think...

37:26.433 --> 37:29.304
That's what you came up here for,
isn't it?

37:31.229 --> 37:35.393
- I wanted to check on you.
- You're searching for your faith.

37:36.151 --> 37:38.607
You think you lost it,
but you only buried it.

37:40.196 --> 37:41.656
It's never left you.

37:58.214 --> 38:02.626
In the name of the Father, of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

38:02.801 --> 38:04.794
Amen.

38:05.304 --> 38:08.638
May God, who enlightens
every heart...

38:08.808 --> 38:11.642
...help you to know your sins
and trust in his mercy.

38:13.145 --> 38:15.517
- Father, I can't...
- Luka.

38:16.022 --> 38:18.810
Your heart is burdened, Luka.

38:19.484 --> 38:23.696
Talk to me.
Let me take that burden with me.

38:30.494 --> 38:33.164
I don't know. I...

38:35.625 --> 38:37.997
Lost my family.

38:41.255 --> 38:46.842
Danijela, my wife, she wanted
to move out of Vukovar.

38:47.010 --> 38:50.878
But I had to finish my internship.

38:52.265 --> 38:57.472
And soon it was too late.
It wasn't safe to move.

38:58.062 --> 39:02.107
I was gonna get some supplies...

39:02.275 --> 39:05.809
...and I made them stay behind.

39:05.987 --> 39:09.023
I was just crossing the street when...

39:09.198 --> 39:12.484
...the mortar shell hit
the apartment building.

39:16.497 --> 39:18.620
Go on.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.412
I ran inside.

39:30.803 --> 39:36.045
There were my neighbors. Hurt.
Bleeding. Dying. But I passed them by.

39:36.266 --> 39:37.925
I had to get to my family.

39:38.351 --> 39:39.727
Danijela!

39:40.312 --> 39:41.640
Danijela!

39:50.905 --> 39:52.981
Luka.

39:57.703 --> 39:59.909
Luka...

40:08.630 --> 40:10.622
Marko...

40:49.085 --> 40:51.956
A piece of shrapnel had torn
into Danijela's spleen...

40:52.130 --> 40:53.589
...and she was bleeding to death.

40:54.215 --> 40:59.209
When I turned back to my daughter,
she wasn't breathing.

40:59.387 --> 41:04.594
I lost her pulse. But as long as
I kept doing CPR and breathing...

41:04.767 --> 41:08.266
...for my daughter,
I thought she had a chance.

41:08.812 --> 41:13.024
I could only pray that someone
would get there to help.

41:23.660 --> 41:28.121
If I had picked up Danijela at that
moment and gotten her to the hospital...

41:28.290 --> 41:33.497
...she could have had surgery.
You know, she could have lived.

41:33.670 --> 41:36.504
But I couldn't leave my little girl.

41:42.929 --> 41:48.281
I waited and prayed.
I prayed someone would come.

41:52.688 --> 41:54.894
And no one came.

41:56.191 --> 41:57.602
No one came.

42:00.529 --> 42:03.897
Jasna. Jasna.

42:06.576 --> 42:10.953
I called out for hours
as I stayed there...

42:11.122 --> 42:14.787
...breathing for her, doing CPR.

42:19.630 --> 42:22.999
I finally had to stop from exhaustion.

42:30.057 --> 42:32.513
I lost them all.

42:35.228 --> 42:39.060
You couldn't sacrifice the one
to save the other.

42:39.983 --> 42:42.770
Even if you had,
you'd still blame yourself.

42:49.033 --> 42:51.904
These things can't be explained.

42:52.078 --> 42:54.486
Why it happens.

42:54.956 --> 42:59.250
The providence of God
and the mysteries of life and death...

42:59.419 --> 43:02.869
...are the very fiber of our faith.

43:05.007 --> 43:10.381
They were gifts of love and life.

43:11.471 --> 43:14.638
You are a gift of love and life.

43:15.016 --> 43:17.768
Don't turn your back on them.

43:20.313 --> 43:25.936
God, father of all mercies,
through the death and resurrection...

43:26.111 --> 43:28.945
...of your only begotten Son...

43:30.030 --> 43:32.782
...was reconciled himself to the world...

43:32.950 --> 43:37.612
...and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins.

43:38.163 --> 43:41.414
Through the ministry of Holy Church...

43:41.583 --> 43:44.953
...may God give you pardon and peace.

43:45.963 --> 43:49.581
And I absolve you of all your sins...

43:50.634 --> 43:54.133
...in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

43:54.888 --> 43:57.509
...and of the Holy Spirit.

43:59.976 --> 44:02.051
Amen.
