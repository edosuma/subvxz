01:37.389 --> 01:40.117
Come on, let's go. Come on,
everyone, let's go.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.662
- I'm open, I'm open. Throw it again.
- I'm open.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.796
<i>Okay, let's see who we got here.</i>

01:50.277 --> 01:53.130
<i>"Virge Hoogesteger."
What kind of name is that?</i>

01:53.196 --> 01:54.343
<i>"Youngest of 6."</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:58.807
<i>Worked in the family diner before
joining up. Writes home every week.</i>

01:58.869 --> 02:00.596
<i>"Nicknamed 'The Virgin."'</i>

02:00.662 --> 02:03.982
Come on, we need a little
teamwork here. Come on, fellas.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.768
<i>Now, who's this goon?</i>

02:05.834 --> 02:08.402
<i>"Jack Bocci from the
South Side of Chicago.</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:10.985
<i>Graduate of several
reform schools."</i>

02:11.048 --> 02:12.741
<i>Better keep him in the background.</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:14.367
Bullshit!

02:16.303 --> 02:19.782
<i>This is the religious one. Oh,
there's always a religious one.</i>

02:19.848 --> 02:23.828
<i>"Eugene McVey from Cleveland."
There's always one from Cleveland.</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:28.044
<i>"Nineteen, high-strung, always
coming down with something."</i>

02:28.106 --> 02:30.049
<i>How'd he get in this bunch?</i>

02:32.194 --> 02:36.845
<i>"Richard 'Rascal' Moore.
Eighteen, 5-foot-4, 120 pounds.</i>

02:36.907 --> 02:39.635
<i>Has a real reputation
as a ladies' man."</i>

02:39.701 --> 02:42.054
<i>At least, that's what he says.</i>

02:43.288 --> 02:46.733
<i>"Clay Busby, a farmer's
son." Now, look at this.</i>

02:46.792 --> 02:49.236
<i>"When his father lost their
farm in a poker game...</i>

02:49.294 --> 02:52.364
<i>Clay started playing piano
in a New Orleans cathouse."</i>

02:52.422 --> 02:53.899
<i>Oh, the papers will love that.</i>

02:53.965 --> 02:55.783
Come on. I'm open.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.697
<i>This kid couldn't be more
Irish if he tried. "Danny Daly.</i>

02:59.763 --> 03:02.707
<i>'A' student, editor of the
school paper, Valedictorian.</i>

03:02.766 --> 03:06.666
<i>"He volunteered the day after
he graduated from college."</i>

03:06.728 --> 03:07.875
Danny! All right!

03:07.938 --> 03:12.043
<i>That's not bad. I think we've got
something to work with here.</i>

03:12.109 --> 03:15.383
Oh, come on. Get up, get up.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.593
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

03:19.866 --> 03:21.934
They're coming in!

03:32.337 --> 03:34.781
That's 15, 16.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.535
- There's another one.
- Hurry, you're counting today.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.787
At this point, 15 or 16.
Sir, they're still coming in.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.047
How can I promise you
24 planes tomorrow?

03:50.105 --> 03:52.549
I don't even know if
they'll all make it back.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.463
Where?

03:55.610 --> 03:58.554
I thought we hit that
target a month ago, sir.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.175
Yes, I know we have to
keep the pressure on...

04:01.241 --> 04:04.470
but I lost almost a quarter
of my squadron, sir.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.519
Yes, sir.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.060
I will have the ground crews
work through the night.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.479
But I was hoping to give
the boys a little break.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.774
We're having a dance tonight in
honor of the group's first ann...

04:19.341 --> 04:21.035
Yes, sir.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.622
Yes, I will give you an
update when I know more.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.330
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.921
Sir, 18 planes, three still out.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.186
So that's the crew of
the <i>Memphis Belle</i>, huh?

04:47.245 --> 04:50.145
Those are the enlisted men. You're
meeting the officers this afternoon.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.645
They must be the 10 luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.735
- They're just ordinary men, colonel.
- Are you kidding?

05:01.343 --> 05:04.162
Ordinary? First they
volunteer for all this...

05:04.221 --> 05:07.325
and then they fly 24
missions without a scratch.

05:07.390 --> 05:11.336
- That doesn't sound very ordinary to me.
- Two more, sir.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.139
You know, people back home are getting
pretty discouraged by our losses.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.268
They're starting to think daylight
bombing is a big mistake.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.147
- It's the only way we're gonna win this war.
- We gotta get that message across.

05:30.205 --> 05:34.105
That's where I come in. The nation is
gonna fall in love with those boys.

05:34.167 --> 05:38.363
The first crew in the Eighth Air Force
to complete their tour of duty.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.239
- They haven't done it yet.
- They will.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.117
You're gonna make
sure of that. Right?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.911
One more. Just one more.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.251
Boy, it'd be great if
everybody came back today.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.883
- With the dance and everything.
- I give them 4-to-1.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.919
Any takers?

06:00.986 --> 06:03.930
- Yeah, I'll have some of that.
- Show me your money, Jack.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.933
- Genie, loan me some money, huh?
- What do I look like, Wells Fargo?

06:06.992 --> 06:09.265
- No, you look like a weenie...
- There it is!

06:12.497 --> 06:14.941
I heard they brought in a
swell band for the dance.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.353
- Maybe they'll let you croon a tune.
- No, sirree.

06:17.419 --> 06:21.319
- You sing to us in the plane all the time.
- Yeah, but you guys ain't got no taste. Heh.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.569
- Abandon ship now, everybody!
- Let's get out of here!

07:03.632 --> 07:05.793
- Let's go!
- Come on, come on, hurry up!

07:05.800 --> 07:08.369
Hurry up! Let's get out of here!

07:32.994 --> 07:35.722
So you named the plane after
your girl back home, right?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.266
Heh, that's a great angle.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.776
You don't sound like you're
from the south, though.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.062
I met her when I was in
Memphis on business.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.152
Yeah, I bet she's a
living doll, eh, Dennis?

07:45.215 --> 07:46.817
She's a very fine woman, sir.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.822
Uh-huh.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.870
Oh, a lifeguard? Wow, that's a
pretty responsible job, eh, Luke?

07:53.932 --> 07:57.878
Well, it's rough basking in the sun all
day, having girls swarm all over you.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.164
So I joined up. Had to get
away from all of that.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.879
- That's good.
- Yeah.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.837
All right. "Val." And
what is that short for?

08:06.903 --> 08:08.175
"Valentine."

08:09.447 --> 08:11.424
I bet the women love that.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.309
Now, you're the bombardier...

08:13.368 --> 08:17.814
and, uh, I understand you have 4 years
of medical school under your belt.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.102
Believe me, as soon as your picture
comes out in <i>LIFE</i> magazine...

08:21.167 --> 08:24.988
every man, woman and child in America
is gonna want you to be their doctor.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.817
Would you look at the camera, Phil?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.661
Sit up straight.

08:32.761 --> 08:36.366
- Smile?
- What is there to smile about, sir?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.794
You guys have finished 24 missions.
One more and you go home.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.375
That'd sure make me smile.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.169
Well, you're not me.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.893
Would you please just
take the picture?

08:47.736 --> 08:49.276
- Is that all, sir?
- Not quite.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.676
You'll go back home in the
<i>Belle,</i> fly all over the U.S...

08:53.742 --> 08:56.937
making speeches, getting people
to buy more war bonds...

08:56.995 --> 08:59.939
work longer hours,
put out more planes.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.602
And, uh, believe me, you'll be
wined, womened and songed...

09:03.668 --> 09:06.317
from one end of the
States to the other.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.234
It'll be tough, but, uh, we
all have to make sacrifices.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.074
- You mean we're gonna be famous, sir?
- I'm afraid so, Luke.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.074
- Colonel Derringer?
- Ah-ah-ah.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.334
I'm Army PR. You can call me Bruce.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.954
We'll follow your orders
to the best of our...

09:23.021 --> 09:26.842
These are not orders, Dennis.
We're working together on this.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.595
Fine. But I don't want the other men
finding out about this yet.

09:30.653 --> 09:35.099
Pictures in <i>LIFE?</i> Wine, women and song?
You gotta tell them. They'll go nuts.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.558
I don't want them going nuts.
I want them thinking about their jobs.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.475
Come on, we could do our jobs in
our sleep. Why can't they know?

09:43.166 --> 09:45.268
Because I said so.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.277
My father used to say that.

09:52.926 --> 09:58.283
Dennis, you're the boss. You tell the
crew whenever you think it's right.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.748
Now, can we have
just one more shot?

10:01.976 --> 10:05.046
What? Are you kidding me?

10:05.355 --> 10:07.056
- What are you smiling about?
- Ha-ha-ha.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.256
You're the one that put this
unclean deck in this barracks.

10:10.318 --> 10:14.468
Okay, get your money. Once
again, Jack Bocci gets stiffed.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.601
Clay, shouldn't you let the sarge
go through Becker's stuff?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.731
Sarge will just send
it to Becker's widow.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.063
We don't want her getting
anything embarrassing.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.194
- Candy bar.
- Me.

10:28.878 --> 10:33.654
Danny, which one of these do you like better?
This one's shiny aluminum. It's very modern.

10:33.716 --> 10:38.492
And this one is a little more homey,
with the brick and the little bushes.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.499
- This one. Why?
- Well, it's important, see.

10:41.558 --> 10:45.162
I'm gonna plan to open a bunch of
restaurants exactly like the first one.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.922
So you could go to Detroit and
get the same hamburger...

10:47.981 --> 10:50.129
you got in Baltimore
or in Philadelphia...

10:50.191 --> 10:53.010
Nobody's gonna want the same
old food everywhere they go.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.676
Sure they do. It's comforting.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.930
- It's com... It is comforting.
- Love letters.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.225
- Wife or girlfriend?
- Ooh, read them out loud. Get me in the mood.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.018
Girlfriend.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.905
- Pocketknife. Photos.
- Does he have any clean socks in there?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.526
Hey. Dirty book.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.410
Hey, I'll take it.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.905
Ah.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.328
Hey, look.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.709
- Becker forgot his good-luck charm.
- Poor slob.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.711
Should've worn it around his neck.
Then he'd never forget it.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.372
- Rubbers.
- Dibs!

11:30.315 --> 11:32.133
Virge the Virgin won't need these.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.966
Promise me if you ever lose
your cherry, you'll tell me.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.721
I'll send it to you COD.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.223
Say, Clay, give me.
Becker owed me 10.

11:39.282 --> 11:43.353
- Jack, don't take his money.
- Hey, clam up, you mug-face, he owed me.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.184
What do you guys
know about Germany?

11:45.288 --> 11:46.890
- Pretty women.
- Good beer.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.356
- The hamburger's named after a town there.
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

11:50.418 --> 11:54.068
A little bird tells me that's where
they're sending us tomorrow.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.487
- Are you sure?
- Uh, we ain't going to Crowdville.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.901
Our plane's broke.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.490
- No, it's fixed.
- Christ, let's go break it.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.914
They wouldn't send us to
Germany our last time.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.576
- They'd send us on a milk run to France.
- I hope so.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.790
They would.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.172
Anybody want the rest of this stuff?
Who wants the cigarettes?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.333
Let me take the razor blades.

12:17.904 --> 12:22.931
<i>All the little birdies went tweet-tweet
'Neath the spreading chestnut tree</i>

12:22.992 --> 12:28.144
<i>I said, I love you
And there ain't no ifs or buts</i>

12:28.206 --> 12:32.106
<i>He said, I love you
And the blacksmith shouted</i>

12:32.168 --> 12:33.520
Chestnuts!

12:33.586 --> 12:38.613
<i>Underneath the spreading chestnut tree
There he said he'd marry me</i>

12:38.675 --> 12:44.703
<i>Now you ought to see our family
'Neath the spreading chestnut tree!</i>

12:54.524 --> 12:55.796
Eugene!

12:56.651 --> 12:58.879
Hey, Genie.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.432
I'm sending this to your wife.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.725
Now they're saying we may be
going to Germany tomorrow.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.024
My short, young life could be
snuffed out in an instant.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.731
I volunteered because I
thought it would be fun.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.692
I never thought I could...

13:17.088 --> 13:20.988
Oh, Faith, when I think I might
never see the stars again...

13:21.050 --> 13:23.448
or listen to good music...

13:23.553 --> 13:25.997
or talk to a beautiful
girl like you...

13:27.140 --> 13:29.038
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.828
You need a drink. I'll...
I'll be right back.

13:33.521 --> 13:38.718
Oh, Danny, she is crazy about me.
She's gonna jump on me any second.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.303
Think you had enough?

13:44.365 --> 13:47.435
How come they brought <i>LIFE</i> magazine?
Are they trying to jinx us?

13:47.493 --> 13:51.018
Forget about it. Let's get a
couple girls. Let's go dance.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.026
Tell me the truth. The truth.
Are you scared?

13:55.084 --> 13:56.561
No.

13:56.919 --> 14:00.193
I'm Val. Come on.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.194
That's my favorite food
in the whole world.

14:05.261 --> 14:09.036
You've never had a hamburger? Unbelievable.
You don't know what you're missing.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.791
They sound wonderful.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.170
It's been so long
since I had any meat.

14:14.395 --> 14:18.875
See, I work the meat very slowly, you
know, very tenderly. That's the secret.

14:18.941 --> 14:23.342
And I rub in a little Worcestershire
and add a little garlic, a little thyme.

14:23.446 --> 14:27.767
And then I ease it into a patty very
gently so I don't bruise the meat.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.436
Virge, you're making me so hungry.

14:45.635 --> 14:49.831
We're gonna have to excite people on
this bande tour, inspire them, you know?

14:49.931 --> 14:53.911
Now, Dennis, he's a fine man, but
he doesn't have your enthusiasm.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.873
I'm a qualified pilot, same as him. They
just didn't have a plane ready for me...

14:57.939 --> 15:02.089
so he's, uh, a big-shot pilot and
I'm sitting in the dummy seat.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.881
Hey. You're no dummy, Luke.
We both know that.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.805
Being captain?

15:09.867 --> 15:14.894
Well, uh, you've got nine men who are
totally depending on you. Do you...?

15:15.415 --> 15:19.770
So, what did you do before the war?
I was in the furniture business.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.531
This isn't like making furniture.
See what I mean?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.909
Right. Yeah.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.114
- I'm not making any sense, am I?
- No, no, you are.

15:31.514 --> 15:35.869
Look, thanks a lot, captain. Uh,
I'm gonna get back to my date.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.345
Yeah, it's the truth.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.053
<i>Green eyes</i>

15:49.115 --> 15:53.186
<i>A pool wherein my love lies</i>

15:53.244 --> 15:57.269
<i>So deep that in my searching</i>

16:25.443 --> 16:27.796
Well, I...

16:29.113 --> 16:31.090
I'm gonna miss you, gal.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.052
We, uh...

16:35.203 --> 16:37.271
been together a long time...

16:37.330 --> 16:40.980
and, well, you've
never let me down.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.775
I can't say that about many people.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.030
You know how to take
care of your man...

16:50.092 --> 16:54.413
and, well, that's about the best thing a
fellow can say about any gal, I guess.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.540
I can't believe it.

17:00.436 --> 17:04.131
It's gonna be over so soon.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.095
I can't imagine going home.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.051
Home, heh. Yeah.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.808
Won't be the same, will it?

17:34.929 --> 17:36.497
Good night.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.683
Virge, I wish you'd
talk to me like that.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.891
Shh. You know what the captain
would do if he caught us here?

17:59.954 --> 18:03.433
He'd murder me. This is...
Oh, jeez, put that out.

18:03.499 --> 18:07.149
Come on. Let's just get this over
with and get back to the dance.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.315
Ah! Wait, wait.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.366
There. What's that?

18:12.466 --> 18:15.490
Oh, my wrench. I've been looking
for that. Where'd you find it?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.914
- Under my bum.
- Oh, thanks.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.495
Boy, I thought someone had
stolen it. I got worried...

18:20.558 --> 18:23.958
Virge, forget the bloody wrench.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.841
I'm sorry. Shh, sorry.
Here, here, let me rub it.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.878
You've never done this
before, have you?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.388
Why? Am I doing something wrong?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.560
No.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.234
Hey, fellas. Is that your
brand-new plane out there?

18:54.342 --> 18:57.036
- Yeah. <i>Mother and Country.
- Mother and Country.</i>

18:57.094 --> 18:58.571
Aw.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.818
- Had our first practice today.
- How'd it go?

19:00.848 --> 19:04.248
Well, we need a couple more.
And if you guys have any advice...

19:04.310 --> 19:07.209
Yeah. Get a gun, shoot
yourself in the foot, go home.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.611
Now, that's good advice.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.920
Are those size eights?

19:10.024 --> 19:13.253
How about leaving a will saying
when you get your ass shot off...

19:13.319 --> 19:16.889
that those nice shiny new
pumps come to me, huh?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.058
Rascal.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.316
You okay?

19:36.050 --> 19:37.493
Yeah.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.824
Nerves, I guess.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.115
They were just fooling around.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.917
I remember when I first got here.

19:44.975 --> 19:49.205
- Same thing.
- I'd give anything to be in your place.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.965
One more and you
guys get to go home.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.627
Sometimes I wish I could stay.

19:54.944 --> 19:58.594
Heh, sounds crazy,
but I'm used to it here.

19:59.573 --> 20:03.849
These guys... These jerks
are like brothers to me.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.230
I never had any brothers.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.108
I have four older sisters.

20:10.584 --> 20:14.188
When we get back home, I don't know when
we're all gonna get together again.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.232
We come from all over.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.492
I guess that's why I keep
taking their pictures. Heh.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.074
You'll be like that with your crew.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.577
Here. Close your eyes.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.038
Go on.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.959
It's good luck.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.174
Excuse us, fellas.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.941
Hey, Clay, now's your chance.
Get up there and sing.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.823
I'm not gonna get up in front
of all these folks and make...

20:57.882 --> 21:01.361
- Come on, you're a great singer.
- Oh, no, I couldn't do that. Uh-uh.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.911
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, uh...

21:06.515 --> 21:08.367
we have, uh...

21:08.726 --> 21:10.920
10 very special men here tonight.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.800
And, uh, I'm sure you
know who I mean.

21:15.858 --> 21:20.464
They're just about to become the
first crew in the Eighth Air Force...

21:20.529 --> 21:24.099
to fly their 25th
and final mission.

21:24.158 --> 21:27.432
Let's hear it for the crew
of the <i>Memphis Belle.</i>

21:27.495 --> 21:29.313
- Hip-hip!
- Hurray!

21:29.371 --> 21:31.644
- No, no. It's bad luck.
- Hip-hip!

21:31.707 --> 21:34.185
Hip-hip.

21:44.804 --> 21:49.250
Let's do "Danny Boy" in C, and I'm
gonna come in on the second part.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.666
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.418
Um...

21:55.481 --> 21:57.834
this buddy of mine keeps
begging me to sing and...

21:59.235 --> 22:02.009
Well, it looks like I ain't
gonna get out of it this time.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.218
So here goes.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.142
<i>Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes</i>

22:10.204 --> 22:13.604
No, get back here. You're
not getting out of this.

22:13.666 --> 22:20.445
<i>From glen to glen
And down the mountainside</i>

22:22.383 --> 22:29.367
<i>The summer's gone
And all the roses falling</i>

22:29.890 --> 22:33.790
<i>It's you, it's you must go</i>

22:33.853 --> 22:37.457
<i>And I must bide</i>

22:40.568 --> 22:45.515
<i>But come ye back
When summer's in the meadow</i>

22:45.573 --> 22:50.429
<i>Or when the valley's hushed
And white with snow</i>

22:51.036 --> 22:56.188
<i>It's I'll be here in sunshine
Or in shadow</i>

22:56.250 --> 23:01.607
<i>Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
I love you so</i>

23:20.649 --> 23:23.127
I don't wanna die.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.263
I don't wanna die!

23:32.828 --> 23:35.056
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

23:58.312 --> 24:00.631
- Captain Dearborn. Captain Dearborn.
- Yeah?

24:00.689 --> 24:04.794
Mission today. Breakfast,
0600. Briefing, 0645.

24:04.860 --> 24:08.385
- Lieutenant Sinclair.
- I'm up, I'm up.

24:10.407 --> 24:14.137
- Where's Lieutenant Lowenthal?
- Val, where's Phil?

24:14.203 --> 24:17.603
Uh, he's in the can.
He couldn't sleep.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.856
- He had nerves.
- Yeah, can't say as I blame him.

24:20.918 --> 24:23.862
- Give them hell today, sir.
- Yeah.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.842
Jack.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.427
Oh, no.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.389
I can see it. I get back home,
I'm doing it to the wife...

24:54.451 --> 24:57.805
the door breaks open, and
there's Danny taking a picture.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.896
- Anybody seen my St. Anthony's medal?
- Isn't he the patron saint of missing things?

25:02.001 --> 25:04.195
Yeah, I can't find him.

25:05.796 --> 25:10.743
Chief? Chief, I need you
over hereto look at this.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.370
Bogey, 6 o'clock, low.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.660
- Good morning.
- Morning, lieutenant.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.290
What, are you drunk?

25:20.394 --> 25:23.543
- Why? Are you?
- Are you kidding? We got a mission.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.090
I know, that's why.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.588
See, I'm gonna get it today.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.971
My number's up. My luck's run out.

25:31.697 --> 25:34.926
And I'm gonna die, so I wanna give
you something to remember me by.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.057
You gotta get ahold
of yourself, junior.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.722
I don't want your watch.
Everybody's counting on you.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.433
What about my cuff links?
You want my gold cuff links?

25:42.499 --> 25:45.148
- They got my initials...
- You'll let everybody down.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.484
Want my New York Yankee
baseball cards? I got DiMaggio.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.566
What about my Rita Hayworth pinup?

25:51.300 --> 25:54.700
Stick your finger down your throat.
Stick your finger down your throat.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.490
Stick your finger down your throat
or I'm gonna do it for you.

26:03.145 --> 26:05.293
I feel better.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.600
You're not thinking of sneaking
this on the plane, are you?

26:16.658 --> 26:20.058
Danny, I am shocked at your behavior.
Virge goes out for the pass.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.187
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, wise guys. Knock it off!

26:24.249 --> 26:25.441
Found it.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.481
- Hey. Here.
- Dance with me, Danny.

26:27.503 --> 26:28.855
This is not funny.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.207
These powdered eggs would gag
a buzzard. You done with that?

26:44.311 --> 26:47.585
Know what? It's gonna be a milk
run today. I can feel it in my bones.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.633
That's what you said last time.
They sent us to Wilhelmshaven.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.636
- I hope they don't send us back there.
- They wouldn't do that.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.298
Not to my mama's baby boy. Heh.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.476
- Thanks.
- Give them hell today, sir.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.933
- Bacon?
- Yeah.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.808
- Eggs?
- No.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.477
Give him extra. He's real hungry.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.701
- Morning, men.
- Morning.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.702
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah.

27:17.761 --> 27:18.953
Stop it.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.490
You won't have a chance to
do that after today, sir.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.160
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure
about that. Right, Dennis?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.329
Oh!

27:30.399 --> 27:33.878
Well, looks like we've all got
the jitters this morning.

27:33.986 --> 27:37.386
- I'll see you after briefing.
- Chief.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.849
How the hell is he gonna get
through a navigator's briefing?

27:46.915 --> 27:49.234
On a wing and a prayer.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.899
I thought we'd have a little
more practice before we went up.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.942
You'll do fine.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.950
Ten-hut.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.492
At ease, gentlemen.

28:08.604 --> 28:13.756
I hope you all had a good time last
night, but now it's back to business.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.846
The target for today is Bremen.

28:27.706 --> 28:31.151
We've been given a chance today to
make a real difference in this war...

28:31.210 --> 28:33.688
so let's do this job
the best we can.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.357
Leave the rest in the hands of God.

28:36.423 --> 28:41.245
With luck, it'll all be over soon and
we can go back home to our families.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.872
Good luck. Over to
you, Major Comstock.

28:44.514 --> 28:48.209
Good morning, gentlemen. Sergeant,
would you get the lights?

28:48.268 --> 28:50.666
This is our target area right here.

28:50.729 --> 28:54.459
Long, rectangular buildings. The only
long, rectangular buildings in the area.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.796
You can't miss them.

28:55.859 --> 28:59.213
Note this S-shaped road going through
the factory for your sighting.

28:59.321 --> 29:04.097
The Flugzeugbauer factory is a major
assembly plant for 190 fighter planes.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.478
Now, you're leading
the group today.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.898
Three hundred and sixty planes
are bombing on your command.

29:09.957 --> 29:13.152
So let's be accurate.
This is a civilian area here.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.940
This is a hospital. These are houses.
This is a school and a playground.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.860
Note the railway tracks
north-northwest.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.039
- Hey. Bremen.
- Bremen?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.575
- Oh, we're dead men. We're dead.
- Shut up, Rascal.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.330
- You shut up, Virgin.
- Cut it out.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.621
Clay, what are the odds today?

29:31.687 --> 29:34.085
You figure they're gonna
overload us with bombs...

29:34.147 --> 29:37.467
so it's 30-to-1 we'll crash and
blow up on takeoff, right?

29:37.526 --> 29:40.175
Then they're gonna throw every
fighter they got at us...

29:40.237 --> 29:41.930
Skip the gory details.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.384
- Basically, we're finished.
- Chief's coming.

29:54.001 --> 29:57.480
<i>Amazing grace</i>

29:57.546 --> 30:02.322
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

30:02.384 --> 30:09.208
<i>That saved a wretch like me</i>

30:09.266 --> 30:12.836
<i>I once was lost</i>

30:12.894 --> 30:16.544
<i>But now am found</i>

30:16.606 --> 30:22.588
<i>Was blind but now I see</i>

32:03.088 --> 32:06.613
- Uh, tower, this is Army 485. Over.
<i>- 485, go ahead.</i>

32:06.716 --> 32:09.865
Uh, this is a radio check. Charlie,
Uncle, Victor, Tango, Nancy.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.373
- Please acknowledge. Over.
<i>- 485, I read you.</i>

32:13.432 --> 32:16.081
Soon as you're ready, call in.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.337
Bombardier checking in.

32:18.395 --> 32:19.838
Navigator checking in.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.790
Top turret checking in.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.006
Radio operator checking in.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.221
Ball turret checking in.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.974
Right waist gunner checking in.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.386
Left waist gunner checking in.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.682
Tail gunner checking in.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.980
Intercoolers.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.770
- Set.
- Generators.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.482
- Set.
- Fuel boost pumps.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.241
Set.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.783
Good. Crew, assume
positions for takeoff.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.740
Uh, chief, there's a jeep coming.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.205
- Hey, captain.
- Yeah?

32:58.268 --> 32:59.415
We got a delay.

32:59.478 --> 33:03.003
There's a cloud cover over the target
but a strong chance it'll blow over.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.292
- Stand by until further notice.
- For how long?

33:05.358 --> 33:07.335
They don't tell me doodly, sir.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.505
Damn it. They always do this.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.016
We're delayed. There's cloud
cover over the target.

33:13.074 --> 33:16.734
<i>They're asking us to stand down until
further notice. Danny, tell the others.</i>

33:16.786 --> 33:20.186
Fellas, the target's clouded
over. We're delayed.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.976
Aw, son of a bitch!

33:23.043 --> 33:25.566
- Snafu.
- Situation normal.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.573
All fucked up.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.359
Hear that, Clay?

33:30.759 --> 33:34.363
Okay, Luke, let's take this extra time
to double double-check everything.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.282
Let's make this our
best mission yet.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.996
- Brakes.
- Didn't you hear?

33:39.059 --> 33:42.914
There's complete cloud cover over
Bremen. We're not going anywhere.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.626
Brakes.

33:46.816 --> 33:50.887
Set. They were set before,
and they're still set.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.923
Intercoolers.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.637
Check.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.265
- Burners.
- On.

33:58.328 --> 34:01.898
- Generators.
- Off.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.277
- Fuel booster pumps.
- On.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.779
- Hydraulic pressure.
- Check.

34:07.837 --> 34:11.237
- Fuel-transfer valves.
- Off.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.743
Oxygen supply.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.746
Say, Pop, is it busted?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.502
I don't know what's wrong with it.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.382
I got one just like that at home. Why
don't you let me take a look at it?

34:27.524 --> 34:28.824
Ah, you're just nervous.

34:28.858 --> 34:32.588
I'm not. The thing jammed on me last
mission. I have to sit in this rattrap.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.382
I checked it out top to bottom.
It's okay. Take it easy.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.676
Gee, thanks, Virgin.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.103
- The name's Virgil.
- Not to me, it isn't.

34:40.203 --> 34:44.774
- You know, Rascal, I could tell you something.
- What could you tell me, Virgin?

34:45.375 --> 34:46.943
Nothing.

34:53.300 --> 34:57.405
All you gotta do is call on the intercom and
say you have a little trouble in the tail.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.868
I come back, you give me
the gun for five minutes.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.456
- It's against regulations, sir.
- Come on. Screw the regulations.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.792
Sir, if they found out, they'd put
my hot dog in a bun and chow down.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.299
Nobody's gonna find out.
This is between you and I.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.585
Come on, I just wanna get my
hands on a gun just once.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.401
How am I gonna get girls back
home if I haven't killed a Nazi?

35:15.447 --> 35:18.471
Clay, please. I'll do anything you say.
Just name your price. Come here.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.476
Wild dog.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.184
- Anything, sir?
- Anything. anything.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.849
Give me your dog.

35:37.510 --> 35:41.456
- Seven-to-1 we're not going.
- Let's just go and get it over with.

35:41.514 --> 35:45.289
I'd rather get it over going to
a nice little French target.

35:45.352 --> 35:48.126
If we bail out, we can hide in
some French girl's hayloft.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.961
Rascal, is that all
you think about?

35:50.023 --> 35:52.342
Yes, Virgin, it is. I have
to make up for you.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.970
- Why don't you grow up, Rascal?
- Shut up, Virgin. You make me sick.

35:56.029 --> 35:59.303
- Why don't the both of you shut up?
- All right. All right.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.184
- Come on.
- Calm down.

36:01.242 --> 36:04.642
Getting excited isn't gonna
make this go any faster.

36:04.704 --> 36:08.058
Just relax. Try to be a
little bit more like Phil.

36:12.295 --> 36:15.490
- Hey, what do we got here? Poetry.
- Hey, give it back.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.322
- We have a poet on board.
- May I have my book, please?

36:18.385 --> 36:21.329
- Why don't you read us a poem, Danny?
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.468
- I wanna hear some poetry.
- No, no, no.

36:23.473 --> 36:26.042
No, nothing's finished.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.203
I didn't know you wrote.
Read us something.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.463
Yeah, I wanna hear
some poetry. Come on.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.129
- Come on, Danny, don't be shy.
- Read us something you've started.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.971
We got a regular old
Shakespeare on board, fellas.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.631
Frilly words there.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.802
- You got a good tone, Jack, heh.
- Tone-deaf.

36:50.291 --> 36:54.396
<i>I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above</i>

36:54.462 --> 36:55.609
Oh, Lord.

36:58.007 --> 37:02.487
<i>Those that I fight I do not hate
Those that I guard I do not love</i>

37:07.142 --> 37:10.746
<i>Nor law, nor duty bade me fight</i>

37:11.312 --> 37:14.507
<i>Nor public men, nor cheering crowds</i>

37:15.233 --> 37:17.176
<i>A lonely impulse of delight</i>

37:18.027 --> 37:20.721
<i>Drove to this tumult in the clouds</i>

37:25.869 --> 37:30.395
<i>I balanced all, brought all to mind</i>

37:30.790 --> 37:33.393
<i>The years to come
seemed waste of breath</i>

37:34.461 --> 37:36.563
<i>A waste of breath the years behind</i>

37:38.339 --> 37:43.366
<i>In balance with this
life, this death</i>

37:52.479 --> 37:54.456
Captain!

37:54.522 --> 37:59.048
You're going up. Start engines
in five minutes. Five minutes.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.061
Say, lieutenant, lieutenant, um...

38:09.120 --> 38:12.690
I was thinking, if you really want to,
you can come back and fire my gun.

38:12.749 --> 38:15.068
- I'm not giving you my dog.
- Oh, lieutenant.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.480
I don't want that flea-bitten,
mangy old pooch anyway.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.567
Okay. Wake up, Phil.
Time to go to work.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.120
Here we go, boys.

43:25.770 --> 43:29.625
Okay, Mona baby. We're gonna
get us a nice 109 today.

43:29.690 --> 43:31.792
We did it before,
we'll do it again.

43:31.901 --> 43:35.346
Sweet-talking your gun won't help,
Jack. Just straight shooting.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.632
Hey, shut up, Gene.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.093
Well, you know, when I got
my two Nazi fighters...

43:40.159 --> 43:41.511
Hey, shut up.

43:42.870 --> 43:45.018
Okay, Jack.

43:49.627 --> 43:52.025
- Climb power.
- I know.

43:52.088 --> 43:55.658
- Watch the cowl flaps.
- I know.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.669
Look out! Oh, my God!

44:41.846 --> 44:44.950
Luke, take over for a minute.

44:46.809 --> 44:51.130
Hey, it's <i>Baby Ruth.</i>
Who's our right wingman?

44:51.189 --> 44:53.007
<i>Mother and Country.</i>

44:53.065 --> 44:56.260
Oh, swell. The rookie crew.

44:56.736 --> 44:59.180
- Soup?
- No, thank you, sir.

44:59.238 --> 45:01.557
- Luke?
- No, thanks.

45:05.578 --> 45:10.024
- Captain, okay if I arm my bombs?
- Yeah, go ahead.

45:10.458 --> 45:13.607
- Val, take this.
- You're not gonna die.

45:13.669 --> 45:15.112
Just in case.

45:15.213 --> 45:18.908
You're flak-happy. Now, just
do your job and shut up.

45:34.607 --> 45:36.050
Bombs armed.

45:36.108 --> 45:39.337
Rascal, there's nothing
wrong with the ball turret.

45:39.403 --> 45:43.679
- Don't worry your pretty head about it, Virge.
- I'm just doing my job, Rascal.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.685
Oh, now you do it?
Thanks a lot, buddy.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.939
- Okay?
- Yes, thank you.

46:05.513 --> 46:08.412
We're at 10,000 feet. Let's
hear those oxygen checks.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.619
<i>Clay, how you doing back there?</i>

46:11.686 --> 46:13.914
Well, I'm doing just
fine, lieutenant.

46:26.033 --> 46:29.637
Captain, we're exactly 5 miles
south-southwest of Great Yarmouth.

46:29.745 --> 46:33.349
We're in formation. This
is the rally point.

46:34.750 --> 46:37.945
Okay, boys. We're on our way.

47:12.079 --> 47:15.058
Okay, listen, men. I'm showing
30 below zero up here.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.563
<i>Let's be careful.</i>

47:16.625 --> 47:20.275
<i>Don't touch your guns with your bare
hands or they'll freeze right to it.</i>

47:20.338 --> 47:23.032
<i>I don't want anyone losing
any fingers up here.</i>

47:23.090 --> 47:25.318
<i>Keep checking your masks
for frozen saliva.</i>

47:25.384 --> 47:27.907
<i>That ice gets down there and
blocks your oxygen flow.</i>

47:27.970 --> 47:30.448
<i>- I don't want anyone passing out on me.</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

47:30.514 --> 47:34.790
- In short, don't drool.
<i>- In short, check your mask, Rascal.</i>

47:35.227 --> 47:37.705
All right, let's keep
the intercom free.

47:37.772 --> 47:42.002
<i>Call out those fighters and don't shout.
We can hear you loud and clear.</i>

47:42.485 --> 47:46.431
<i>Let's make this our best run yet, boys,
one that we can really be proud of.</i>

47:46.489 --> 47:48.762
Right in the pickle
barrel, huh, Dennis?

47:48.824 --> 47:52.428
<i>That's right. Keep your minds
on your job, work together...</i>

47:52.495 --> 47:54.097
<i>and stay alert.</i>

47:55.039 --> 47:58.018
Captain, I'm getting A.F.N.
here. Can I put it on?

47:58.084 --> 48:00.528
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Please, sir? Come on, captain.</i>

48:00.586 --> 48:04.281
<i>All right, Danny, but when
I say that's enough...</i>

48:04.340 --> 48:09.241
<i>Why do breezes sigh every evening</i>

48:10.054 --> 48:14.876
<i>Whispering your name as they do?</i>

48:14.934 --> 48:20.461
<i>And why have I the feeling
Stars are on my ceiling?</i>

48:20.523 --> 48:25.925
<i>I know why and so do you</i>

48:25.986 --> 48:31.058
<i>When you smile at me</i>

48:31.117 --> 48:35.188
<i>I hear gypsy violins</i>

48:35.246 --> 48:36.814
Lord have mercy, Jack.

48:36.872 --> 48:42.524
<i>When you dance with
me, I'm in heaven</i>

48:42.586 --> 48:46.907
Heaven? Come to my bunk.
I'll give you heaven, honey.

48:47.716 --> 48:52.242
<i>I can see the sun when it's raining</i>

49:02.148 --> 49:04.842
Okay, let's test our guns.

49:21.750 --> 49:24.069
Little friends, 3 o'clock high.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.664
Oh, God.

49:34.722 --> 49:37.575
I'd give anything to fly a fighter.

49:38.058 --> 49:40.331
You're all alone. You can
do anything you want.

49:40.394 --> 49:42.417
That's flying.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.833
It's the best pen money can buy.

49:44.899 --> 49:48.754
- Why can't I have the baseball cards?
- They're for him. Here you go, Jack.

49:48.819 --> 49:52.890
I'm more of a football fan myself.
You know the Bears?

49:55.326 --> 49:56.473
There. Happy?

49:56.535 --> 49:58.308
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks, Jack.

49:58.370 --> 50:00.347
Thanks, Genie.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.440
<i>Mother and Country calling
Memphis Belle. Come in.</i>

50:05.503 --> 50:08.948
- Read you, <i>Mother</i>. What's wrong?
<i>- Nothing, Danny. I just had a question.</i>

50:09.006 --> 50:12.110
Stan, we're not supposed to use
the radio unless it's an emergency.

50:12.176 --> 50:14.199
<i>Oh, sorry. It was
about my log book.</i>

50:14.261 --> 50:18.207
<i>Whether I should write down every radio
communication I hear or just some of the, uh.</i>

50:18.265 --> 50:21.494
Write down everything. Later on
you'll figure out what's important.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.662
- We better sign off.
<i>- Okay, thanks, Danny.</i>

50:23.729 --> 50:24.921
<i>I won't bother you again.</i>

50:24.980 --> 50:27.924
Hey, smile, I'm gonna
take your picture here.

50:35.199 --> 50:37.176
Hope it comes out.

50:38.452 --> 50:42.273
<i>Okay, boys, we're getting close to enemy
territory now, so let's be on guard.</i>

50:42.331 --> 50:45.401
<i>Call out the fighters as
soon as you see them.</i>

50:45.459 --> 50:48.904
Clay, you sure sang great last night.
You should do like we keep saying.

50:48.963 --> 50:52.863
After the war, go to Hollywood and get
a record contract like Frank Sinatra.

50:52.925 --> 50:56.450
Yeah, so we can say
we knew you when.

50:56.512 --> 51:00.082
No. I'm gonna get a nice little farm,
a nice little wife, and settle down.

51:00.140 --> 51:03.870
Luke's the one who should go to Hollywood.
Shoot, he could star in the movies.

51:03.936 --> 51:07.256
Man. Maybe. Maybe.

51:07.314 --> 51:11.294
I don't know what I'm gonna do
after the war, except not work.

51:11.360 --> 51:16.011
Yeah, Luke, why go back to the daily grind
of being a lifeguard? Take it easy.

51:16.115 --> 51:18.092
I know exactly what I'm gonna do.

51:18.158 --> 51:21.387
Oh, Virge, if I hear one more word
about that stupid restaurant...

51:21.453 --> 51:22.645
It's not stupid.

51:22.705 --> 51:26.355
At least I've got a plan. What are
you gonna do after the war, Rascal?

51:26.417 --> 51:29.566
Come to your restaurant
and rob it. Ha, ha.

51:29.628 --> 51:32.823
<i>Valentine's the smart one.
He's almost a doctor already.</i>

51:32.881 --> 51:35.825
<i>Hey, what kind of doctor
you gonna be, Val?</i>

51:35.884 --> 51:37.702
A rich one.

51:37.761 --> 51:40.614
What about Phil? What's he
gonna be after the war?

51:40.681 --> 51:42.783
I know. A mortician.

51:47.062 --> 51:51.668
Well, hey, fellas, think about this.
My family has a furniture business.

51:51.734 --> 51:56.431
We make furniture and then we sell it.
You could all come to work for me.

52:02.786 --> 52:05.435
Like I said, don't
give it a thought.

52:05.831 --> 52:09.686
Yeah, that's just what we need, you ordering
us around for the rest of our lives.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.320
"Let's do the preflight check."

52:11.378 --> 52:14.378
<i>- Yeah. "Don't hog the intercom."
- "Call out them fighters."</i>

52:14.381 --> 52:17.221
<i>- "Check your masks."
- "Let's make this our best run yet."</i>

52:18.927 --> 52:21.246
I'm not that bad.

52:23.932 --> 52:27.502
Say, Danny-boy, you didn't say what
you're gonna do when it's all over.

52:27.561 --> 52:32.167
Clay, I don't even like to think about it.
I mean, what if something happens?

52:32.232 --> 52:36.838
I mean, well, we could all be old
men by the time the war is over.

52:38.113 --> 52:40.716
It just seems so far
away, you know?

52:41.450 --> 52:43.678
I'm sorry, fellas.

52:43.744 --> 52:45.312
<i>Bandits, five o'clock.</i>

52:54.088 --> 52:56.031
Go get them, little friends.

52:59.176 --> 53:03.656
<i>Hold your fire until Jerry's in range.
Don't waste your ammunition.</i>

53:17.152 --> 53:19.596
<i>I said, hold your fire.</i>

53:19.655 --> 53:22.554
- That was Genie the weenie. Ha, ha.
- Shut up, jackass.

53:33.293 --> 53:35.373
<i>- Six o'clock high.
- Nine o'clock high.</i>

53:35.379 --> 53:37.356
<i>Two 190s, 12 o'clock high.</i>

53:37.423 --> 53:40.493
<i>Three fighters, 9 o'clock coming
around. Keep your eyes on them.</i>

53:40.592 --> 53:43.115
<i>Top turret, 11 high.
Can't reach them.</i>

53:43.178 --> 53:45.280
Got them in my sights, lieutenant.

53:45.347 --> 53:47.620
<i>Bogey, 4 high. Danny, see him?</i>

53:47.683 --> 53:50.662
<i>Two more, 12 o'clock
high, coming fast.</i>

53:57.943 --> 53:59.761
Couple coming in faster. Too high.

53:59.820 --> 54:02.514
- I've got another one on my back.
- I'm on him.

54:08.662 --> 54:11.122
<i>Two went low. Watch
them, waist gunner.</i>

54:11.165 --> 54:12.892
<i>They're flying close today.</i>

54:12.958 --> 54:14.856
<i>5 o'clock high. Looks like a 190.</i>

54:16.503 --> 54:18.276
<i>This guy at 10, he's smoking.</i>

54:18.338 --> 54:20.782
<i>I saw the left waist of
Mother and Country hit him.</i>

54:20.841 --> 54:24.115
<i>Son of a bitch. First
time out, he gets a kill.</i>

54:24.553 --> 54:26.075
<i>He's bailing out.</i>

54:29.266 --> 54:33.087
<i>Call out any planes you see going down
so Danny can put them in his log book.</i>

54:33.145 --> 54:36.249
<i>You know, we've done
this before, captain.</i>

54:36.315 --> 54:38.634
<i>Fighters at 9, but
they're staying away.</i>

54:45.199 --> 54:46.551
<i>One at 10:30.</i>

54:46.617 --> 54:48.719
<i>- Ten-thirty high or low?
- Low, low.</i>

54:48.786 --> 54:51.890
<i>- Here they come.
- Looks like we got company, 7 o'clock.</i>

54:54.792 --> 54:59.147
<i>One-oh-nine, 3 o'clock.
Somebody's going down, 2 o'clock.</i>

55:05.928 --> 55:07.826
<i>109s coming at 10 level.</i>

55:07.888 --> 55:10.207
Come on. Come on.

55:11.892 --> 55:13.790
Come to Papa, you son of a...

55:15.187 --> 55:17.881
<i>I almost had him. Damn it.
Hey, Wiener.</i>

55:17.940 --> 55:20.520
He's coming around again.
Jack, get the greedy bastard.

55:24.863 --> 55:27.512
Two more at 6. They're coming in.

55:31.119 --> 55:33.313
They're going after
the first flight.

55:41.755 --> 55:44.028
<i>Windy City's</i> on fire.

55:49.471 --> 55:53.041
- Why don't they do something?
- Come on, bail out, you guys.

55:53.100 --> 55:54.793
Come on, wake up. Get out.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.875
Jesus, there's a hole
in the pilot's window.

56:01.358 --> 56:03.381
Hold on.

56:04.570 --> 56:05.842
- Call in.
- Tail.

56:05.904 --> 56:07.881
Ball turret. Get us out of here.

56:07.948 --> 56:09.808
- Right waist.
- Keep calling in.

56:09.867 --> 56:12.686
- Bombardier.
- Navigator, check in.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.473
<i>- Navigator.</i>
- Phil.

56:15.539 --> 56:17.812
Here. Navigator checking in.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.353
<i>When I say check in,
that means right away.</i>

56:20.419 --> 56:22.863
Somebody's guts are
all over the nose.

56:22.921 --> 56:25.649
<i>Any damage? Crew,
check your stations.</i>

56:25.716 --> 56:27.284
- Nose okay.
<i>- Tail okay.</i>

56:27.342 --> 56:29.922
<i>- Radio room okay.
- Keep calling out those bandits.</i>

56:42.816 --> 56:44.213
They're gone.

56:44.818 --> 56:48.092
Yep. Hit and run.

56:50.949 --> 56:54.053
Captain, I just heard from C Cup.
They're taking over the lead.

56:54.119 --> 56:56.267
- You hear that, Val?
- Roger.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.524
Okay, C Cup's lead plane now.

56:58.582 --> 57:02.027
- When they drop their bombs, so do we.
<i>- Got it.</i>

57:05.297 --> 57:06.740
<i>Any chutes from Windy City?</i>

57:15.265 --> 57:18.460
Them guys didn't even have
time to pee in their pants.

57:18.518 --> 57:21.747
- Here one minute, gone the next.
<i>- If you gotta go, that's the way.</i>

57:21.813 --> 57:24.632
Listen, do we have
to talk about it?

57:24.691 --> 57:28.011
Hey, fellas, I heard a good one from
the waist gunner of <i>Windy City.</i>

57:28.070 --> 57:29.217
What was his name?

57:29.279 --> 57:31.302
- Cooley.
- No, I mean the left one.

57:31.365 --> 57:33.513
What, am I talking
to myself? Cooley.

57:33.575 --> 57:35.755
- I mean the right one.
<i>- I know the guy.</i>

57:35.786 --> 57:37.566
- Tall guy?
<i>- He wasn't so tall.</i>

57:37.621 --> 57:39.519
Well, everybody's tall to me.

57:39.957 --> 57:42.435
<i>- Lindquist.</i>
- No, no, no.

57:42.501 --> 57:45.650
<i>- Something like that.
- Virge, you're not even close.</i>

57:46.171 --> 57:50.276
Anyway, a plane gets shot down. The guy
bails out and the gestapo gets him.

57:50.342 --> 57:53.742
His leg is broken, so they have to
amputate. He says, "Do me a favor."

57:53.804 --> 57:56.302
<i>After you cut it off, give
it to one of your pilots</i>

57:56.303 --> 57:58.685
<i>and have him drop it over
my base in England."</i>

57:58.725 --> 57:59.872
<i>And they do it.</i>

57:59.935 --> 58:03.335
<i>- Don't tie up the intercom.
- Wait, this is a quick one.</i>

58:03.397 --> 58:05.499
The next week, they cut
off his other leg.

58:05.565 --> 58:09.010
He says again, "Will you drop it
over my base?" And they do it.

58:09.069 --> 58:11.422
The next week, they
gotta cut off his arm.

58:11.947 --> 58:15.267
<i>He asks one more time, "Will you
please drop it over my base?"</i>

58:15.325 --> 58:18.395
This time, they say, "Nein,
this we can't do anymore."

58:18.453 --> 58:24.026
And he says, "Why not?" And they say:
“We think you're trying to escape."

58:27.921 --> 58:30.069
<i>- Son of a gun.
- I don't get it.</i>

58:30.132 --> 58:34.032
That was pretty good, Rascal.
I think even Dennis liked that one.

58:34.886 --> 58:37.455
Stoller. That's the
guy's name. Stoller.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.241
No, no, no.

58:39.307 --> 58:41.205
<i>Stoller wasn't on Windy City.</i>

58:41.268 --> 58:44.292
- You sure?
- Wait, it'll come to me here.

58:44.813 --> 58:48.668
Oh, yeah. I can see
that guy's face.

58:49.276 --> 58:51.174
Yeah, me too.

58:54.614 --> 58:56.967
Well, whatever his name was...

58:57.034 --> 58:58.886
it was a good joke.

58:58.952 --> 59:02.181
Okay, men. Let's
stop fooling around.

59:02.247 --> 59:05.021
Jerry's out there.
Let's look sharp.

59:06.209 --> 59:09.563
Damn. Are the little
friends leaving already?

59:10.255 --> 59:12.904
<i>Well, they sure know
when to run out of fuel.</i>

59:12.966 --> 59:15.160
<i>They ain't dumb.</i>

59:21.850 --> 59:24.920
My medal. Oh, my God, my medal.
Where...? Where's...?

59:24.978 --> 59:27.126
My medal, have you seen it?

59:40.827 --> 59:42.850
Hey, Wiener.

59:44.122 --> 59:45.724
- Thanks, buddy.
- Here.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.485
No!

59:48.543 --> 59:50.862
- Why'd you do that?
- Now we're even!

59:52.130 --> 59:55.951
- Right waist. Right waist, call in.
<i>- I'll kill you!</i>

59:56.009 --> 59:58.282
Radio operator, get back there
and see what's happened.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:00.990
Hey, hey!

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:03.437
Don't ever touch me when
I'm on my gun. You hear me?

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:05.077
Break it up! Jack!

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:07.086
- Break it up.
- Get him back on his guns.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:08.292
- Gene.
- What?

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.799
- What happened?
- Jack threw my medal out the window.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.756
I'm finished, Danny. I'm finished.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:20.350
No, you're not. Look, here. Here,
take my lucky rubber band.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:24.229
It works. I swear to God it works.
You'll be all right. You okay?

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:26.724
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.643
- You'll be okay. I want it back.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.194
<i>Navigator, give us a position.</i>

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.658
Sir, that's the Third
Reich down there.

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:45.038
Now the shit really hits the fan.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:07.306
Sir, uh, I think you
better come take a look.

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:17.449
No, we gotta liven
up that whole area.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.907
And make sure the banner
is centered, right?

01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:25.874
What's the meaning of this?

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:29.878
Then put the piano up on the platform.
It's just a little party, colonel.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.164
I did not order this.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.377
I didn't order this.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.918
Leave this stuff to me. The
<i>Memphis Belle</i> is my job.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.553
And my job is to approve
everything on this base.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.965
I did not authorize a homecoming.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.226
Craig, you're working a little
hard at being a hard-ass.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:48.434
What's the harm in a little party in
honor of these guys? They're special.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:51.770
I have 24 crews up there.
They are all special to me.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:56.780
That's a great story, but baloney's
my business. I know it when I see it.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:02:00.863
All you care about is getting planes
in the air, results, brownnosing HQ.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.905
- The only man in the whole...
- Come with me.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.540
You don't care if these men live or die.
It's just another airplane. If it was...

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:13.000
Sit down.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.251
Start reading.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.970
This one's from a father whose son
had his head blown off over Lorient.

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:30.230
- Craig, I think you're cracking up.
- Read it!

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.868
<i>"Dear Colonel Harriman:"</i>

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.500
<i>Thank you for your
letter about Tommy.</i>

01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:42.116
<i>He was only at your base a month...</i>

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:45.620
<i>but must have made a big impression because
you described him down to his boots.</i>

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.999
<i>I wish you could have told me...</i>

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:53.913
<i>how Tommy died, but I guess we have
to be careful about security and all.</i>

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:56.457
<i>I'm glad he was brave and
did his job to the end.</i>

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:59.968
<i>Maybe his mother and I
raised him right after all.</i>

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:08.769
<i>I guess we'll get used to him being
gone, but not too soon, I hope.</i>

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:11.771
<i>"I can always read your letter,
and that will bring him back."</i>

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.978
<i>Dear sir: Your letter
of December 10th...</i>

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.984
<i>finally made me realize
that my husband is gone.</i>

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:21.114
<i>I have been living in the false hopes that
the telegram I received was a mistake.</i>

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:24.867
<i>Dear sir: I am writing on
behalf of my parents...</i>

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:28.621
<i>who appreciated your letter to
them about my brother's death.</i>

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.829
<i>We were all glad to know
that Frank didn't suffer...</i>

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:34.414
<i>and was not alone when he died.</i>

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.547
<i>I saw him off at the train station
when he left to go overseas.</i>

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:41.255
<i>He was happy and excited to be doing
something important with his life.</i>

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.718
<i>He couldn't stop looking at
the stripes on his shoulder.</i>

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.473
<i>I hope when this is over, the
world will have learned...</i>

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:50.431
<i>that there's a better way
to solve its problems.</i>

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.016
<i>My prayers are for my
husband's comrades.</i>

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:57.104
<i>May they fly safely and return
home to their loved ones soon.</i>

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.316
<i>Best wishes, Mrs. Peterman.</i>

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.714
Bandits, 5 o'clock.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.401
<i>Bogey, 5 o'clock low.</i>

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.351
<i>Blackwell, 3 o'clock high.</i>

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:37.315
<i>I said don't yell on the intercom.</i>

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.895
Breaking low at 5 o'clock.
Ball turret, watch out.

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:45.235
<i>Watch that fighter. He'll twist.
He's doing a half-roll.</i>

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:51.078
That guy had blue eyes.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.293
<i>Tail gunner, one
coming down from 6.</i>

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:59.500
<i>One-ninety, 12 o'clock high.</i>

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.586
He's going for C Cup.
Look out. Look out.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.014
Oh, God. He doesn't
have a parachute.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.895
- Everybody make sure you've got your chutes.
- Parachutes?

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:20.400
- There isn't enough room to breathe in here.
- Then put your safety strap on.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.060
- It hurts.
- Do it.

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.239
Captain, I just heard from C Cup.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:38.080
They're dropping out of formation.
We're in the lead now.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:41.041
Bye-bye, C Cup.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.506
The bogeyman's gonna get them.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.798
Danny, get me C channel
to talk to Group.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.218
Those poor bastards.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.232
This is the <i>Memphis Belle.</i>

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.893
We're lead plane now.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:07.656
I'm gonna do my best to get the bombs right
in the pickle barrel and get us out safe.

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:12.490
<i>I'm gonna need all the help you can give me,
so let's tighten up and be on our toes.</i>

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:16.748
<i>We're 3 minutes, 30 seconds
from the bomb run.</i>

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.799
Bloodsucker, 1 o'clock level.
Ball turret, watch out.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:47.817
I'm jammed, Virge. He's coming at me.
Help me, Virge! He's coming right at me!

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:56.995
And your mother too.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.326
Damn.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.211
Oh, my God. Jack's hit. Jack's hit.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:16.349
<i>- Val, get back there and look at Jack.</i>
- I'm 2 minutes from the bomb run, captain.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:20.102
<i>- Okay. Gene, take care of it.</i>
- Hold still. Hold still. Let me look.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.108
What are you laughing about?

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:35.277
It's a scratch. Look, it's nothing.
And you're screaming like a stuck pig.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.539
They destroyed my
favorite harmonica.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:43.622
Oh, you rotten son of a bitches!

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:49.503
You son of a bitch. You
scared the shit out of me.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:07:59.809
How'd you do that?

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.471
Magic.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:06.850
<i>Flak, 12 o'clock level.</i>

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.939
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:14.574
They got something like 500
antiaircraft guns around Bremen.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.451
I could live without
knowing that, lieutenant.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:21.331
<i>Hey, Clay, what are the odds of
us getting out of here alive?</i>

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:24.037
Uh, just figuring that out.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:25.576
Damn.

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:29.956
- Oh, jeez.
<i>- What's wrong, ball turret?</i>

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:33.218
A big piece of Nazi flak
just hit my turret.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.549
<i>- Well, are you okay?</i>
- I guess.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.714
<i>- You guess or you are?</i>
- I am.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:41.430
All right. I hope everybody's
wearing their flak jackets.

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:52.608
<i>Mother and Country
calling Memphis Belle.</i>

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:56.774
<i>Danny, this flak is not like I expected.
Can't the captain fly above it or something?</i>

01:08:56.841 --> 01:09:00.821
No, we've gotta fly straight
through it or we'll be off target.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:04.036
- It's just, uh, 4 minutes.
<i>- Yeah, just.</i>

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.553
Bombardier, I'm turning
on the autopilot.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.224
You're flying the plane
from here to target.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.439
- She's all yours.
- Roger.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.613
Hold her steady, Val.

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:44.580
Christ, I've never seen
it this thick before.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:48.622
Luke's hit! Luke's hit!

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.834
- Jesus Christ!
- It's not me. It's not me, it must be you.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.975
- It's not me.
- I think he's in shock.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:56.925
- No, I'm not. You're in shock.
- Val, better get up here quick.

01:09:56.984 --> 01:10:00.179
- Hey, I'm on the bomb run.
- Well, it's definitely not me.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.177
Definitely not me either.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.184
It's gotta be somebody!
There's blood all over the cockpit!

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:06.686
It's tomato soup.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.357
What was that?

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.990
There's a hole as big as
my dick in the left wing.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.695
We're losing fuel.

01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:27.578
Virge, get on the
fuel-transfer pump.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.234
Oh, the electrics must
be out on the left side.

01:10:32.235 --> 01:10:34.439
The pump's not responding.
I'll do it by hand.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.660
Luke, get back there, give him a hand.
We need to save as much fuel as we can.

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:39.544
- Unh.
<i>- Two minutes to target.</i>

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.476
Bomb bay door is open.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.824
Jesus.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:05.283
- Virge.
- Okay.

01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:17.753
Bombardier to pilot. Target is covered.
Looks like a smoke screen.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:21.419
Fuel transfer complete.
I think we saved a little.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.009
Bombardier, how does
that target look?

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:27.258
Target totally obscured.

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:31.521
Thirty seconds to target.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:58.331
Listen, Val, I need those bombs on target.
The whole group is bombing with us.

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:01.250
Well, if I can't see, I can't see.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:11.219
- What do you think you're doing?
- We came to bomb a factory.

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.905
We're gonna bomb a factory, even
if it means going around again.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:18.060
Going around on a bomb run is suicide.
That's like asking the Nazis to blow us...

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.148
Luke, I'm in command.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:24.778
Captain, what do you want me to do?

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:34.909
Shit.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:42.208
- Bombardier, give me a report.
<i>- Visibility, zero.</i>

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.303
You do it and we're dead.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.434
- We're going around again.
- Damn!

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:56.348
Danny, get me C Channel
to talk to Group.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:04.860
Get off of me.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:09.361
- Just drop them, Val.
- Just shut up!

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:12.322
Please.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:19.462
<i>It'll take five minutes to get
back to the start of the bomb run.</i>

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.588
Navigator, give me a position.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:27.007
<i>- Navigator. Did you hear me?</i>
- Yes, sir.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:32.675
<i>Everybody listen.</i>

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:36.472
I know you wanna drop the bombs
and get the hell out of here.

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:39.481
But there's civilians down there.
There's a school next door.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.190
If we don't drop these in the pickle barrel,
there's gonna be innocent people killed.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:46.822
- What's the difference? They're all Nazis.
- Luke, shut up.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:51.736
Now, I don't wanna do this
any more than you do.

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:54.121
We were sent here
to bomb a factory.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.521
<i>If we don't do it, somebody's gonna have
to come back here again and do it for us.</i>

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:02.414
<i>Nobody said this was
gonna be fun and games.</i>

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.129
<i>It's our job. Ours. Nobody else's.</i>

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:08.302
<i>If we do this thing right...</i>

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.964
<i>it's something we can be
proud of our whole lives.</i>

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.100
<i>That's all I want,
fellas. Believe me.</i>

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:20.607
Now, let's get back to work. Call out
those fighters when you see them.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:39.163
<i>- Bandits, 3 o'clock high.</i>
- I see them.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:58.140
<i>Four right there on the level.
They'll be all over us in a second.</i>

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:05.268
<i>Calling in four,
lining up to come in.</i>

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.983
Bandit, 12 o'clock high.
Cockpit, he's heading for you.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:15.119
What am I supposed
to do, spit on him?

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:23.370
- Tail gunner, how you doing back there?
- I'm just peachy, lieutenant.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.965
Well, if you need any
help, let me know.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.547
<i>I sure will, but I think
I'm doing fine right now.</i>

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:34.638
Oh, lieutenant, um, actually,
I do need some help back here.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:37.641
- Tail gunner, what's wrong?
<i>- I'm running out of ammo.</i>

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.178
I'll take care of it.

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:43.268
Why can't somebody else do it?
Left waist, right waist.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:46.309
<i>Chief, we got fighters
all over us back here.</i>

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:49.695
Dennis, I'm the only one
not doing anything.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.941
Okay. But make it fast.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:55.701
<i>Watch that fighter at 10.
He's coming in a half-roll.</i>

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.581
<i>- I see him. He's a 109.
- Jerry, 5 high. Gene, watch yourself.</i>

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.704
<i>Blackwell's, 2 high, breaking under.
Watch them, ball turret.</i>

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.710
<i>Read you, bombardier.</i>

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:11.293
Hey. Clay.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.428
Hey. Watch it, watch it.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:16.055
Great.

01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:19.642
I owe you one, brother.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.223
Nice view you got out here.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.935
<i>Tail gunner, see that bandit at
7 low? He's all yours, Clay.</i>

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.978
<i>Two bogeys coming in 4 high.</i>

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:34.031
<i>They're Messerschmitts,
coming fast.</i>

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.443
<i>Ball turret, 109
coming in about 7 low.</i>

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:40.079
<i>I'm on him. Two of them, 3 high.
Keep your eyes on them.</i>

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:42.865
<i>Seven level, coming in
like a son of a bitch.</i>

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:44.830
I got him. I got him! Whoo-hoo!

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.752
<i>I got him!</i>

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:56.804
It's the rookies.
They got the rookies.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:02.264
<i>Memphis Belle to Mother
and Country. Come in.</i>

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.724
<i>Memphis Belle to Mother
and Country. Come in!</i>

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:07.057
<i>Oh, my God, oh, no! Oh, God, no!</i>

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.858
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ, no!</i>

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.020
How many chutes from
Mother and Country?

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.359
<i>I saw two.</i>

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.567
Yeah, two.

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:08.159
<i>Captain, this is the bomb run.</i>

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:10.828
Okay, bombardier.
I'm turning it over to you.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:12.668
- Roger.
- It's all yours, Val.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:20.095
Luke, after delivery, on
the way to rally point...

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:24.350
I'm gonna take some evasive action
to avoid this flak. Be ready on rudder.

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:27.557
Whatever you say, Dennis.
You know what you're doing.

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:42.326
Bombardier, how does
that target look?

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.659
Like shit.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:11.305
Captain, I still can't see a thing.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:29.411
Oh, Lord, come on.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.538
Bombardier, how does
that target look?

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:40.133
Target's still covered, captain.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.758
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.769
<i>Captain, do you read me?</i>

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:55.141
Yes, I read you.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:02.114
My sight says I'm over the target.
I've gotta do something.

01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:05.025
<i>Now, what do you want me to do?</i>

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:19.373
That's it.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:24.087
That's it. That's it. Bombs away.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:09.891
Okay, boys, we've done
our job for Uncle Sam.

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:11.846
Now we're flying for ourselves.

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.369
Bomb doors closing.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:45.923
Jerry, breaking low to 9 o'clock.
Ball turret, watch it. Watch it.

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:49.255
I'm jammed. I'm stuck again.
Oh, shit, I'm stuck again.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:51.215
Virge, get me out of here.

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:55.223
Virge, get down here and help me.
He's coming right at me. I'm jammed again!

01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:57.103
Virge, help!

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:01.274
Rascal!

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:16.783
Grab hold of me. I'll undo your
safety strap. Hold on, okay?

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:20.160
- Come on up here, buddy.
- Oh, Jesus, help me!

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:23.581
Grab on to me. I got you, Rascal,
I got you! Grab hold of me!

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:27.547
Come on. Come on, Rascal, come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.635
You're okay. You're safe.
You're safe.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:36.678
You're all right. You're gonna be okay,
okay? Listen to me. You're all right.

01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:40.643
You're okay, all right? You're okay.
Come here. You're okay.

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:43.104
You're okay. You're going home.
You're going home.

01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:57.205
- Now what?
- Call in.

01:22:57.264 --> 01:22:59.867
<i>- Call in now.</i>
- Grab the fire extinguisher!

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.077
I'll take care of Danny.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:15.257
Rascal, watch Danny!

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:23.436
- Danny's hurt.
- Val, Danny's hurt.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:26.944
<i>- Get back there and see what you can do.</i>
- Well, how bad is it?

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:30.106
<i>Well, I guess it's pretty bad, Val.</i>

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:33.151
- What are you doing? It's Danny.
- I can't. There's fighters...

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.366
- I'll cover your gun. Just go.
- Maybe somebody in the back can...

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:37.871
Hey, hey, you're the doctor.

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:40.954
That's just it.
I'm not, Phil. I lied.

01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:43.953
I had two weeks of medical
school before I enlisted.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:45.746
I don't know anything.

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:50.133
You just do it.

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:39.053
<i>Captain, somebody just shot a
big chunk out of the tail.</i>

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.262
There's a fire in Number 4.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:47.604
Cut fuel. Feather prop. Fire
extinguishers. Generator off.

01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:51.728
- Call out those fighters.
- Oh, jeez. Danny's in bad shape.

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.280
- How's Rascal?
- He's okay.

01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:55.236
The extinguisher's not working.

01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:57.902
Gotta do something quick or
we're gonna lose that wing.

01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.115
We gotta dive.

01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:04.207
- I'm gonna need your help to pull out of it.
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:05.913
<i>Memphis Belle to Group.</i>

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:09.546
We're gonna have to dive to put out
this fire. Wingman, you're lead plane.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.207
Everybody, hang on.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:56.968
Two seventy-five.

01:25:57.027 --> 01:26:00.552
- We're exceeding maximum dive speed.
- We've gotta level her out.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:04.435
Fire's not out. Just a bit more. A bit
more and we're gonna lose the wing.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:07.767
Trust me. Just a few seconds more.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:10.098
Come on, baby, come on.

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:19.691
It's out!

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:27.662
Come on, baby. Hold on, hold on.

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:04.327
Crew, we're at 10,000 feet.
You can come off oxygen.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.378
Thanks, Luke.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:17.378
Once in a while, I'll
do something right.

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:22.762
I don't know what else to do.
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:26.596
- How far is it to base?
- On three engines, two, two and a half hours.

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:29.307
Two and a half hours?
He'll never make it.

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:31.471
- Val, help him.
- What do you want from me?

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:35.313
This man needs a hospital.
All I got is a stupid first-aid kit.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.239
Here you go, Danny.

01:27:46.386 --> 01:27:48.580
Okay, okay. There's one
more thing we can do.

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:49.955
What? Let's do it.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:52.288
We can put a parachute
on him and push him out.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.420
- Jesus Christ, Val.
- It's crawling with Germans down there.

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:58.458
- They'll take him to a hospital.
- If they don't kill him.

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:01.593
It's his only chance. Another crew
did it. This guy lost an arm.

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:04.755
- But that guy was conscious.
- Danny can't even pull the cord.

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.093
We can pull it first.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:08.509
- He could fall in a lake.
- Val, can't we wait?

01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:11.724
We'll be over the North Sea in
10 minutes. It's gonna be too late.

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:14.686
Well, if we're gonna do it,
we're gonna have to do it now.

01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:21.039
- Watch his back.
- Keep his head up.

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:24.191
- Don't push, don't push.
- Careful, careful. Come on.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.155
All right, Val, I'll go along with
anything you say. You're the doctor.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:31.540
We just don't have a choice.
We've gotta do it.

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:33.666
- Tell the men that's my decision.
- Dennis...

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:36.954
Phil, I don't want any argument.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.292
Val, Val.

01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:41.132
- Please don't do it.
- It's his only chance.

01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:44.010
You're his only chance, but
you're too chicken to help him.

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:45.591
If he stays on board, he'll die.

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:48.257
If you throw him out, he's
gonna die, and you know it.

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:58.016
Val, you can save him.

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:03.147
So what if you're not a doctor yet?
You can help him. I know you can.

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:06.032
Val, he needs you. He's gonna die.

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:10.116
Don't do this, Val. You'll always
regret it. I know you're scared.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.995
But we're all scared.
Now go help Danny.

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:21.670
Let's go. All right, hold
his head. Okay. All right.

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:26.966
Come on, baby.

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.848
- Come on, Babe Ruth.
- Let's do it.

01:29:31.575 --> 01:29:33.518
Come on, baby.

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.981
There they are!

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:02.418
Seven.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.048
- Eight.
- No, nine.

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:06.585
Did you get that one over there?

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:14.059
- How many so far?
- Nine, sir.

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:17.972
- There's another one out there.
- And the <i>Belle?</i>

01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:20.686
No, sir. Not yet.

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:28.736
Feather prop. Cut fuel.

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:32.952
Listen, men. We're flying
on two engines now.

01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:35.284
Let's lighten up. Throw
out everything you can.

01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.996
We're close enough to
home, so lose your guns.

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:41.875
We never did get that
fighter, did we?

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:44.881
Ah, shit on a stick.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:49.928
Whoa, Emma. You can
have my bullets too.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:02.019
Ain't that a pretty sight?

01:31:22.352 --> 01:31:26.002
<i>I balanced all, brought all to mind</i>

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:30.969
<i>The years to come
seemed waste of breath</i>

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:34.176
<i>A waste of breath the years behind</i>

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:37.934
<i>In balance with this
life, this death</i>

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.721
Yeats.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:43.018
It's okay, Danny.

01:31:43.665 --> 01:31:46.939
I didn't write that.
It was W.B. Yeats.

01:31:48.545 --> 01:31:51.649
- I couldn't...
- Take it easy.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.369
Don't do this to me, Danny.

01:32:02.142 --> 01:32:03.414
Damn it.

01:32:06.104 --> 01:32:08.332
Come on. Danny.

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:10.592
One more. One more like that.

01:32:18.158 --> 01:32:20.852
You try that again
and I'll kill you.

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:50.381
Landing gear.

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:01.513
Somethings wrong.

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:04.304
Something is wrong. One
wheel didn't come down.

01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:06.768
Take it back up. We'll belly-land.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:09.559
Nothing's coming up,
nothing's going down.

01:33:09.626 --> 01:33:12.024
The electrics must be totally out.

01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:17.784
All right. Virge, lower the wheel by hand.
Luke, tell me when it's down.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:20.411
Crew, take positions
for crash landing.

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:23.039
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:26.372
Get out of the way. Come on,
Jack. You gotta help me.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:42.892
- We're losing Number 3.
- Are we out of fuel?

01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:45.595
Fuel gauge is shot. How long
can we fly on one engine?

01:33:45.662 --> 01:33:49.062
I don't know.
I guess we'll find out.

01:34:37.922 --> 01:34:39.615
Come on. Come on.

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:42.402
Get out of the way, Virge.
Move. Let me in there.

01:35:00.987 --> 01:35:03.215
Come on, come on. Faster, faster.

01:35:07.118 --> 01:35:10.597
Come on. I got it, I got it.

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:31.830
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling</i>

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.383
Hurry it up!

01:35:40.026 --> 01:35:42.220
We're not gonna die.
We're not gonna die.

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:51.263
Oh, my God. It's only
got one wheel down.

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:26.597
Flaps.

01:36:26.656 --> 01:36:29.225
We're not gonna die.
We're not gonna die.

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:36.232
We're gonna live.

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:40.004
We made it! We made it, Genie!

01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:42.131
We're home, Danny-boy.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.588
Oh, thank God.

01:37:50.156 --> 01:37:52.554
Danny-boy, we're home. We're home.

01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:35.181
- Easy, easy.
- I'm gonna need the IV.

01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:42.813
I love you!

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:58.624
Welcome back, boys.
Terra firma, huh? Ha, ha.

01:38:58.683 --> 01:39:02.879
We can clear this whole area out.
Just put him down in front.

01:39:02.937 --> 01:39:05.085
This is fine.

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:07.959
Can we have the officers in front?

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:11.049
Uh, Luke, why don't you
come around in the front?

01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:15.846
Okay, uh, now, officers in the center.
Luke, come here up front.

01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:18.352
Just take the picture, Bruce.

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:21.890
What's wrong, cap?

01:39:22.305 --> 01:39:28.627
