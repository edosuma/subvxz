00:11.720 --> 00:13.000
The night is very special.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.000
<i>Used to sit and write at home
And now I am noticed</i>

00:18.080 --> 00:20.240
<i>Silence is an answer too
I learn from it</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:23.320
<i>Chances don’t just come along
I grab them</i>

00:23.400 --> 00:26.040
<i>Don’t know about others
But I go straight through them</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:28.600
<i>I set out to find a new world
And found new rules</i>

00:28.680 --> 00:30.960
<i>Why do you sit dejected?
Get back up</i>

00:31.040 --> 00:33.840
<i>How right are you?
Ask yourself, not them</i>

00:33.920 --> 00:36.440
<i>Those who want
To see you fall fly over them</i>

00:41.000 --> 00:44.200
Maybe there’s magic or something,
but at night whenever I sit to write,

00:44.280 --> 00:46.640
I’ll get ideas for songs.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.880
Mom would never sleep. When I’d get home,

00:49.960 --> 00:51.640
she’d be annoyed and say,
“The Night King is back."

02:08.000 --> 02:09.760
At night, there is motivation

02:09.840 --> 02:14.160
and a power that pushes people
to make things happen.

02:16.039 --> 02:18.040
It’s been in our blood since childhood.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.600
This is the energy of my city.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.600
Thank you.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.360
AMI BEHRAM SHROFF, WINNER
INCA MIXOLOGIST OF THE YEAR

06:00.440 --> 06:01.800
BACARDI LEGACY
FINALIST

06:27.040 --> 06:28.720
"Let her do what she wants" kind of thing.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.360
Patio for you?
You didn’t taste this, right?

08:53.880 --> 08:56.360
Mumbai is a city of hustlers
and I’ve been hustling from day one

08:56.440 --> 08:57.720
and I’m still doing it.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.880
The streets of Mumbai
have always been my teacher.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.680
I've learned more
from the streets than in school.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.560
When I was in school,
the teacher made us stand up

09:17.640 --> 09:19.880
and say our names and where we live.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.200
I stood up and said, “I live in Dharavi.”

09:31.560 --> 09:34.000
My classmates laughed at me.
They said, “You live in Dharavi.”

09:36.640 --> 09:38.880
“That's where thieves live.”

09:41.120 --> 09:44.120
I felt bad.
Did I really live in a place like that?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.320
What’s up, Sunil?

09:59.200 --> 10:03.880
But when I explored it,
I found it very beautiful.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.400
Muslims, Christians, and Hindus
stay together and chill together here.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.320
There has been so much development lately

10:31.400 --> 10:34.200
so people now see Dharavi
in a different light.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.040
Everyone says Dharavi is heart-shaped.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.240
So I think of Dharavi as Mumbai's heart.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.280
-What’s up, boys in the hood?
-What’s up?

10:49.840 --> 10:53.080
Let’s do a cipher,
let’s have some fun. Let’s go.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.240
<i>Believe in yourself
Don’t count your mistakes</i>

10:55.320 --> 10:56.160
<i>Brother, you will never fall</i>

10:56.240 --> 10:58.120
<i>Feel the intoxication in my voice</i>

10:58.200 --> 10:59.640
<i>When I write with tenacity</i>

10:59.720 --> 11:01.880
Mumbai is a city that never sleeps.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.360
The night is a space
where there are no interferences.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.600
We are in our own skin.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.760
I meet dreamers too, all types of people.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.120
<i>-Both spell danger, a lovely…
-Combo!</i>

11:28.200 --> 11:30.400
<i>People's nature changes me
Like the weather</i>

11:47.720 --> 11:50.840
<i>I sit at home and enjoy the view
It's green till the eye can see</i>

11:50.920 --> 11:54.600
<i>I rep both Bombay and Punjab
My flow is cold like the north</i>

11:55.720 --> 11:58.880
Mumbai rap is different because
it has many different languages.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.640
Marathi, Tamil, Hindi.
This is a powerful mix.

12:02.720 --> 12:03.880
<i>Gum for kites</i>

12:03.960 --> 12:07.440
<i>Using plastic balls dipped in water
To play ball with each other</i>

12:07.520 --> 12:08.840
<i>During the school holidays
You remember everything</i>

12:08.920 --> 12:10.840
There is story, there is pain.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.720
People don’t want to just listen
to songs about cars

12:16.800 --> 12:19.080
as everybody doesn’t have a car
in their home.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.960
Not everyone parties every day.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.160
This is why I feel Gully rap
is so relatable.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.240
The whole country thinks,
“Yes, he is describing my story.”

12:39.200 --> 12:43.680
When I’m rapping or making music
I never think, “I am from the streets.”

12:45.280 --> 12:47.480
If I had that mentality,

12:47.560 --> 12:50.560
I wouldn’t be able to compete
with other rappers.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.480
I always think of myself
in terms of hip hop.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.320
I can fight with anyone. I am no less.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.880
After joining Gully Gang,
I started performing in different shows

13:04.960 --> 13:07.640
and now, even in different cities.

13:08.360 --> 13:13.120
Gully Gang is a crew that every boy
from the street dreams of joining,

13:13.800 --> 13:18.400
a role model for upcoming artists from
the streets who want to do something big.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.760
I can’t hear anything.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.800
Can you hear my rap
from the mic from there?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.640
Is the mic off? It’s off.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.640
<i>Hard work has been my cheat code</i>

13:43.720 --> 13:46.120
<i>Beast mode
I don’t stop, I reload</i>

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
<i>I’m in full control like
I got my hands on a remote</i>

13:56.840 --> 14:01.000
I’ll be interacting with my fans
after a long break.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.000
I’ve been waiting for a long time
to perform on stage again

14:05.080 --> 14:07.080
and I want to see how the audience
responds to my songs.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.120
Like, when I drop a beat,
are they making noise?

14:10.200 --> 14:13.480
This gets me very excited
and I’m very happy

14:13.560 --> 14:15.880
that I’m performing for a crowd today.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.440
What ingredients are in the dish?
Ginger, garlic, and?

14:59.160 --> 15:00.240
Cumin seeds, etc.?

15:00.320 --> 15:01.400
Chaat spice mix.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.040
Wow!

16:00.360 --> 16:03.240
into something that is crave-worthy,
that’s addictive,

16:03.320 --> 16:04.840
that’s satisfying, that’s comforting.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.360
-Did you make it spicy?
-Yes.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.560
Can I get <i>pav bhaji</i> chutney
on the side, please?

16:10.640 --> 16:11.560
-I’ll bring it, yes.
-Thank you.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.240
-Today is very hot.
-Yes, it is hot.

17:05.320 --> 17:09.760
We have to stand in the heat

17:09.839 --> 17:13.240
for eight to fourteen hours,
so I am used to it.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.040
A lot of customers told me that
they have eaten at 5-star restaurants.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.440
They have eaten <i>pav bhaji</i> that
costs 450 rupees in the Taj Mahal Hotel

18:02.520 --> 18:05.240
but they told me,
“It was not as tasty as yours.”

18:07.000 --> 18:11.760
I never dreamt my restaurant
would be crowded

18:11.840 --> 18:15.040
or families would wait in line.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.880
Mumbai is good.
There is beauty and business.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.280
I guess I was ten when I came to Mumbai.

18:35.840 --> 18:39.240
I used to sell all sorts of fruits
from a handcart.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.920
Previously, there were mills in Tardeo.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.200
Many laborers worked there.

18:52.560 --> 18:58.400
So at the end of their shift,
people would come and have a meal.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.200
My mind started racing.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.640
I thought I should also start
a food business.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.320
Then I started to make <i>pav bhaji</i>
my own way.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.360
Is everything ready to be made?

19:17.440 --> 19:21.200
Make seven to eight plates of <i>pav</i>
for him. Make them hot.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.360
-Add one more. That will do.
-Add one more.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.360
I used to cook it by using oil

19:29.440 --> 19:34.160
but I thought I should sell a dish
of higher quality.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.600
So I replaced it with butter,
which was typically used in restaurants.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.480
It’s okay that butter
is an expensive item,

19:41.560 --> 19:43.000
but I didn’t think much about that.

19:43.080 --> 19:48.600
If they asked, I’d give it.
It grew slowly, but it worked.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.680
It took time, but it worked.

20:02.040 --> 20:05.680
People started coming
after hearing good things about my food.

20:05.760 --> 20:10.040
They came from Lal Baug, Parel,

20:10.120 --> 20:13.480
Byculla, Bhandup,

20:13.560 --> 20:14.760
and a lot more places.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.880
When I bought this shop,
even families started to come.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.240
They didn’t come while
I was still selling it on my handcart.

21:15.760 --> 21:20.480
I will say at night the glow
and the charm of Tardeo

21:20.560 --> 21:22.480
is because of Sardar Pav Bhaji

21:22.560 --> 21:26.520
and people say Sardar
is the "Sardar of <i>pav bhaji</i>."

21:26.600 --> 21:28.400
He is the king of <i>pav bhaji</i>.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.720
I was a cartman
who progressed to be a shopkeeper.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.640
I was happy,
but I didn’t stop working hard.

21:39.200 --> 21:45.120
People say one who hasn’t eaten at
Sardar’s Pav Bhaji hasn’t seen Mumbai.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.720
What better praise can there be?

23:00.840 --> 23:03.640
The father replies,
"There is one thing that you do for others

23:03.720 --> 23:05.280
and one thing that you do for yourself.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.120
What is it that you do for yourself?"

23:35.640 --> 23:36.680
<i>Namaskaram</i>, friends.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.760
How does it taste like?

30:38.840 --> 30:40.800
-It tastes fruity.
-It tastes fruity.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.600
-Can I try?
-Yes.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.920
-Will I die?
-No.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.280
It is spicy, okay.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.720
How much is this?

32:54.640 --> 32:59.200
Mumbai is a perfect city
for artists and strugglers.

32:59.280 --> 33:02.560
I think Mumbai has a lot of opportunities.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.040
I never wanted fame or money.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.320
I wanted to make my hood proud,
to make Dharavi proud.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.840
Is everyone here enjoying themselves?

33:48.920 --> 33:51.680
What’s up?
Everyone raise their hands with me.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.440
<i>Sometimes I think of what to write
It seems like every day is the same</i>

33:55.520 --> 33:59.400
<i>Friends call me and ask
“Bro, what’s today’s scene?”</i>

33:59.480 --> 34:02.000
<i>There’s a new scene here every day
Who gets to fulfill their dreams?</i>

34:02.080 --> 34:04.760
<i>No sleep in my eyes
Passion keeps its need away</i>

34:04.840 --> 34:07.600
<i>What I decide always gets done
Don’t bow to anyone</i>

34:07.680 --> 34:10.120
<i>I used my songs to win
Next, I rapped about the streets</i>

34:10.200 --> 34:12.400
<i>Third song, the beat was sick
Fourth song, I sorted my scene</i>

34:12.480 --> 34:15.400
<i>Then, on my plate was a full meal
But I still wasn’t happy</i>

34:15.480 --> 34:17.320
<i>I’ve been hungry ever since
And I couldn’t chill</i>

34:17.400 --> 34:19.080
<i>Our parties come with long bills</i>

34:19.159 --> 34:21.880
<i>If you challenge me
I’ll go for the kill…</i>

34:23.320 --> 34:27.000
I like to perform while making eye contact
with every single person

34:27.080 --> 34:29.320
and that’s what energizes me.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.800
I feel that people are here for me
and I am here for them.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.760
<i>I live in my dreams</i>

34:38.560 --> 34:42.840
Do you want to hear the bars?
Do you want to hear my bars and headbang?

34:42.920 --> 34:44.760
Everyone, raise your hands. Let’s go.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.760
Once more, everyone raise your hands.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.679
<i>Used to sit and write at home
Now I am noticed</i>

34:50.760 --> 34:53.199
<i>Silence is an answer too
I learn from it</i>

34:53.280 --> 34:55.600
<i>Chances don’t just come along
I grab them</i>

34:55.679 --> 34:58.360
<i>Don’t know about others
But I go straight through them</i>

34:58.440 --> 35:00.960
<i>I set out to find a new world
And found new rules</i>

35:01.040 --> 35:03.480
<i>Why do you sit dejected?
Get back up</i>

35:03.560 --> 35:06.160
<i>How right are you?
Ask yourself, not them</i>

35:06.240 --> 35:09.160
<i>Those who want to see you fall
Fly over them</i>

35:13.720 --> 35:16.720
I feel proud of my roots.
I’m happy where I came from

35:16.800 --> 35:19.320
and if my hood is proud of me,
it’s a win for me.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.000
People support each other
and know each other's pain.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.480
They ask each other, “How are you doing?”

35:28.440 --> 35:32.160
It teaches us how to be united
and how to carry ourselves.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.040
I learned this from my hood, Dharavi.

35:37.720 --> 35:41.720
My name is MC Altaf
And I’m from Dharavi, Mumbai 17.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.360
MC Altaf!

36:02.680 --> 36:05.800
-How many masala <i>pavs</i>? One plate?
-Yes.
