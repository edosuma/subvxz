WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:07.572
Let me guess, you're either
hiding from our neighbor Dave,

00:07.616 --> 00:10.010
or the Jehovah's Witnesses
are back.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.055
Look, I just want
to get my newspaper,

00:12.099 --> 00:14.014
but every time I go outside,

00:14.057 --> 00:16.929
the guy just sneaks up on me
all quiet like a Prius.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.235
[laughs]

00:18.279 --> 00:19.584
You know,
the other day,

00:19.628 --> 00:21.238
he cornered me talking
about Michigan.

00:21.282 --> 00:25.068
I spent 30 minutes listening
to him rank the Great Lakes.

00:25.112 --> 00:28.028
[laughs] Yup, he did
the same thing to me,

00:28.071 --> 00:30.943
and, ironically,
Lake Superior not number one.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.556
What kind of world do we live in

00:34.599 --> 00:37.037
where a man can't go
outside his own home

00:37.080 --> 00:39.213
without having to say hello
to his neighbor?

00:40.127 --> 00:41.432
What are you doing?

00:41.476 --> 00:42.912
He's hiding from Dave.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.914
Why? The only thing
scary about him

00:44.957 --> 00:46.785
are the tiny shorts he jogs in.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.352
Tell me about it.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.224
The last time I saw
that much white meat

00:50.267 --> 00:51.790
it was fried
and in a bucket.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.792
[laughter]

00:53.836 --> 00:56.273
Well, I know he's not like
most folks around here,

00:56.317 --> 00:58.188
but I think Dave
is kind of cool.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.451
All I know is, since they
moved into this neighborhood,

01:00.495 --> 01:02.801
I feel like I'm on house arrest.

01:02.845 --> 01:06.022
Well, I say don't you let
fear of Dave imprison you, Pop.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.806
Throw off the chains
of your oppressor

01:07.850 --> 01:09.504
and go get that newspaper,
my brother!

01:12.855 --> 01:14.639
But before you do,
close your robe.

01:14.683 --> 01:15.988
I can see your chicken nuggets.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.164
Hey.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.648
Dad, what are
you doing?

01:23.692 --> 01:26.303
I'm seeing if Calvin's outside.
I want to give him something.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.697
I was talking about your shorts.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.918
Well, this is what people
wear in California.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.138
It's so you don't overheat
when you're running.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.836
That's smart, 'cause if
I wore those to school

01:37.880 --> 01:39.751
I'd definitely get chased.

01:39.795 --> 01:43.842
Yeah, by all the ladies.

01:43.886 --> 01:48.020
Ready for school, Grover?
Whoa, look at those sexy legs.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.849
Told you.Why are you still here?

01:50.893 --> 01:52.851
I thought you were
going for a run.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.679
Oh, I'm about to. I was
hoping to catch Calvin outside.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.203
I want to give him
a key to our house.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.682
Really?
Yeah.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.162
Don't you think it's
a little too soon for that?

01:59.206 --> 02:01.208
Uh, well, no,
he's our neighbor.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.166
We gave all our neighbors
keys back in Michigan.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.603
Grammy says people
in Michigan are good,

02:05.647 --> 02:09.303
not like here where they're all
criminals and Hollywood elites.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.436
When did Grammy say that?

02:12.480 --> 02:14.830
Just now. We're texting.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.180
Oh, hey, guys,
there's Calvin.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.357
Buddy, have
a great day. Bye.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.665
Mom, what do you think
of Dad's shorts?

02:23.708 --> 02:25.667
Honestly, I thought
they were yours.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.803
Hey, Calvin!
Oh.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.065
Hey, Dave.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.110
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.459
I want to give you something.

02:35.503 --> 02:38.723
Really? There's enough fabric
in those for pockets?

02:38.767 --> 02:40.986
Here you go.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.162
What's that?

02:42.205 --> 02:43.380
Well, it's a key to our house.

02:43.424 --> 02:44.816
I want you to have it.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.383
I now pronounce
us neighbors.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.560
Nah, I'm good, man.

02:49.604 --> 02:50.648
[chuckles]

02:50.692 --> 02:52.476
Wh-What do you mean
you're good?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.217
I don't need a key
to your house.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.697
What if there's an emergency,

02:55.740 --> 02:57.089
or you want to borrow
something and we're not home,

02:57.133 --> 02:58.787
or it's my birthday
and you want to throw me

02:58.830 --> 02:59.962
a surprise birthday party.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.921
I'm not throwing you
a surprise party.

03:02.965 --> 03:06.098
Exactly what someone throwing me
a surprise party would say.

03:06.142 --> 03:10.059
Look, Dave, I don't know what
it's like where you're from...

03:10.102 --> 03:11.408
Oh, it is beautiful.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.105
I mean, the trees,

03:13.149 --> 03:15.238
they go on for miles.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.110
Okay, look, that's-that's
not what I'm talking about.

03:18.154 --> 03:21.766
Around here, we don't give out
keys to people we just met.

03:21.810 --> 03:22.898
Well, how come?

03:22.941 --> 03:25.640
Simple, people are terrible.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.295
No, they're not,
people are great.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.600
You should try giving them
the benefit of the doubt.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.602
I do. I doubt them every day.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.432
Okay, look, just
take the key, okay?

03:35.476 --> 03:38.957
O-Okay, if I take this key,
can I go read my paper in peace?

03:39.001 --> 03:40.176
Absolutely.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.264
Oh, fine.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.093
All right, talk to you later.
See you.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.921
Oh, and just
one more thing, um...

03:45.964 --> 03:48.402
Dave, we had a deal.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.404
I was just wondering,

03:50.447 --> 03:53.102
is there anything maybe
that you want to give to me?

03:53.145 --> 03:55.278
Yes, some advice.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.845
Stop jogging through
the neighborhood

03:56.888 --> 03:59.630
in your hot pants.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.589
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

04:01.632 --> 04:02.894
♪ Welcome to the hood.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.684
I thought you guys
were going to the park.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.989
It's kind of hot out,

04:11.033 --> 04:12.687
so we thought we'd just
hang out here instead.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.515
Dad says he doesn't
want to go outside

04:14.558 --> 04:16.691
because Mr. Calvin
didn't give him a key.

04:19.215 --> 04:23.611
Grover, it's called father/son
confidentiality.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.482
Are you still hung up
on this key thing?

04:25.526 --> 04:27.745
It's awkward now.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.225
Like when you wave to someone

04:29.269 --> 04:32.228
who you thought was waving
to you, but they weren't.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.710
I told you to stop
waving at everyone.

04:35.753 --> 04:40.018
I'm a waver, Gemma.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.672
It's what I do.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.239
You know I love how
enthusiastic you are,

04:43.283 --> 04:46.111
but sometimes it can get
a little out of hand.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.765
Name one time.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.985
You proposed to me
on our third date.

04:50.028 --> 04:53.380
Yeah. That is because...

04:54.381 --> 04:55.773
we had just had sex.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.777
I'm just saying sometimes
you're ready for things

04:59.821 --> 05:01.257
before other people are.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.693
It might take a while
for Calvin.

05:02.737 --> 05:06.175
Yeah, but it's been a month,
and by that time...

05:06.828 --> 05:08.830
...we had had
a bunch of sex.

05:08.873 --> 05:11.267
Come on, baby, I'll take you,
and if you want to connect

05:11.311 --> 05:12.616
to Calvin, maybe you should try
finding something

05:12.660 --> 05:14.183
you guys have in common.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.968
I'll try, but this guy doesn't
even have a favorite lake.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.321
What up! What up!Oh, hey, baby.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.410
Well, I see you brought
your laundry again.

05:23.453 --> 05:26.195
That's right,
colors and a few whites,

05:26.238 --> 05:28.806
just like this neighborhood
since the Johnsons moved in.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.767
Well, here, let me
take those for you.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.377
Ma, how come you still
do Marty's laundry,

05:34.421 --> 05:35.857
but you won't
do mine?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.380
It's because
he doesn't live here.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.426
It's how I make sure
I see my baby boy.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.297
Yeah, if she wants
to see you,

05:41.341 --> 05:43.212
all she has to do
is check the couch.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.434
Baby, leave him alone.
He's looking for a job.

05:47.477 --> 05:50.393
What job? Manager
of throw pillows?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.134
[laughing]

05:52.177 --> 05:55.355
Yeah, that sounds
like a cushy job.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.444
Oh, and by the way,

05:57.487 --> 05:59.794
this fell out of your
pocket in the wash.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.665
[groans]What's wrong?

06:01.709 --> 06:03.798
It's a key to Dave's house.

06:03.841 --> 06:06.322
He gave it to me
in case of an emergency.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.238
Like I'm gonna help him
in an emergency.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.762
I think that's nice.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.634
We could all learn
a lesson from Dave,

06:13.677 --> 06:15.897
how to open our hearts
to our neighbors, right?

06:15.940 --> 06:17.812
That guy can't teach me
anything.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.553
Well, you know,
I'm glad he moved in.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.816
Giving out keys,
waving at everybody.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.905
He is the most entertaining
thing to happen around here

06:23.948 --> 06:25.733
since Crackhead Victor
found that horse.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.736
Remember when he tried
to footrace him?

06:28.779 --> 06:31.739
[laughter]

06:31.782 --> 06:33.436
Ay, well, you might
not like it, Pop,

06:33.480 --> 06:34.785
but, uh, Dave lives here now.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.570
That makes him
part of our community.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.136
No, no, it doesn't.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.921
You don't let someone
into your community

06:39.964 --> 06:41.923
just because they give you
a spare key.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.620
Come on now,
let's go work on this truck.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.100
Aw, come on, Pop.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.102
That truck is always broke,
and it never works.

06:47.145 --> 06:49.496
Then you two got something
in common. Come on now.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.804
Hey, guys.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.459
What year is that, a '64?

06:56.503 --> 06:58.940
Close, '65.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.116
Oof, should've known.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.945
'64 didn't have turn signals
above the headlights.

07:03.988 --> 07:07.122
Oh, you sound like you know a
thing or two about trucks, Dave.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.211
Well, you know,
I am from Michigan.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.083
Detroit, the Motor City,

07:12.127 --> 07:14.129
The D.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.698
Dave from The D!

07:22.485 --> 07:24.139
See you guys got
a V-8 in there

07:24.182 --> 07:25.532
instead of the straight six.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.968
That's like 50 more horses, huh?

07:27.011 --> 07:28.883
Yes, it is.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.841
So I guess you do
know your stuff.

07:30.885 --> 07:34.236
Yeah, like I said,
Dave from the D.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.848
Dad, I want to use the iPad.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.503
Are you done googling
Mr. Calvin's truck?

07:44.768 --> 07:46.770
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.991
What is wrong with you?

07:50.034 --> 07:52.384
Googling another
man's truck?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.735
Bruh.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.651
I was just trying to find
some common ground with you.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.088
[scoffs] What, by lying to us
that you know about trucks?

08:00.131 --> 08:02.394
Yeah.
Yeah, but in a
neighborly way.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.005
Wh-What's going on here, man?

08:05.876 --> 08:08.400
Uh, look, I know I don't
always show my emotions.

08:10.881 --> 08:14.189
But the other day
when I gave you a key

08:14.232 --> 08:17.018
and you didn't give me
one back, it bothered me.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.890
Bruh.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.632
You know what? You want a key?
You know what? Fine.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.242
Here. Here's a damn key.

08:24.286 --> 08:27.028
Are you sure?
I don't want to impose.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.422
Okay.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.994
I can't believe
you like that guy.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.040
I can't believe
you gave him a key.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.042
I gave him akey.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.696
I didn't give
him thekey.

08:42.739 --> 08:45.220
Okay, then what was that one to?

08:45.263 --> 08:46.874
Oh, that was to
your Uncle Clyde's

08:46.917 --> 08:49.398
storage locker
in West Covina.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.748
Yeah, if ever he
needs 35 broken TVs

08:51.792 --> 08:54.446
or a box of autographed
Hammer pants, he all set.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.544
[whistling][door closes]

09:04.587 --> 09:08.983
Ooh, look at you
looking all fresh and sexy.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.812
Girl, you treating me
like a piece of meat.
[laughs]

09:11.855 --> 09:13.857
And I like it.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.252
Mmm.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.254
What's got you all riled up?

09:19.297 --> 09:22.692
Well, Gemma told me about
how you gave Dave the key,

09:22.736 --> 09:26.217
and it got me to thinking what
a big, generous man I married,

09:26.261 --> 09:29.220
and I guess it put me
in a generous mood, too.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.700
[laughing]

09:30.744 --> 09:32.528
Yeah, you know, baby,
a-about the key--

09:32.572 --> 09:34.399
you know, I-I was...No, no, listen, baby.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.053
Shh. Don't be
embarrassed, okay?

09:36.097 --> 09:37.925
I love it when
you're not afraid

09:37.968 --> 09:41.102
to let people see past that
rough and tough exterior.

09:41.145 --> 09:44.322
Makes me know that you are
still that big, soft teddy bear

09:44.366 --> 09:47.064
that I married
and I'm in love with.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.631
[both laugh]

09:48.675 --> 09:51.808
Yeah?
Yeah. [laughs]

09:51.852 --> 09:55.769
And you know what
bears like? Honey.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.814
[both laughing]

10:00.643 --> 10:02.123
That taste good, too.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.733
Uh-huh.
[laughing]

10:03.777 --> 10:05.648
I made the boys
go to the movies,

10:05.692 --> 10:09.260
so I will be waiting
for you in the cave.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.788
[door opens, closes]

10:16.572 --> 10:18.661
Man, I know that key was fake,

10:18.705 --> 10:20.663
but Lord,
this about to get real.

10:24.319 --> 10:27.061
♪ Today is a good day
[laughs]

10:27.104 --> 10:29.280
♪ Nah, nah-nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah... ♪

10:29.324 --> 10:31.674
My, this smells
good up in here.
Ah.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.197
I'm making banana pancakes.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.069
I'll fix you a plate.
Sit down.

10:35.112 --> 10:38.072
All right. Ma, what's got you
in such a good mood?

10:38.115 --> 10:39.508
Well, let's just say

10:39.551 --> 10:41.336
while you and your brother
were out last night,

10:41.379 --> 10:43.947
your father and I had
a... sensual evening.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.995
And there goes my appetite.

10:48.038 --> 10:51.302
♪ Today is a good day,
today is a good day ♪

10:51.346 --> 10:53.914
♪ Nah, nah-nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah... ♪Yeah, baby.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.524
How you doing, baby?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.265
Mwah.[both laugh]

10:57.308 --> 11:00.311
I would ask for some more honey,
but I believe we fresh out.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.704
Ooh. [laughs]

11:01.748 --> 11:03.401
Hey, man.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.968
That was family honey.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.667
You want me
to make you a plate, babe?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.146
Yeah.
You know, I'll be right back.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.105
I'm-a go get my paper.Oh, guess what.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.672
Mm-hmm.I'll keep it warm for you.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.151
[laughs]
You always do.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.631
[laughs]

11:15.675 --> 11:17.459
Enjoy your pancakes, son.

11:18.852 --> 11:21.419
Your father's a good man.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.421
Yeah? And why do
you say that?

11:23.465 --> 11:25.162
Well, he's finally starting

11:25.206 --> 11:28.122
to open up to Dave,
just like I told him to do.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.124
Yeah, opened up by
giving him a fake key.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.778
A fake key? Now what now?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.433
You know, look, Dave
wouldn't let it go, Ma,

11:35.477 --> 11:38.306
so Dad just gave him
a fake key to shut him up.

11:38.349 --> 11:41.352
[sighs]
So he didn't listen to me?

11:41.396 --> 11:42.963
He doesn't listen to anyone.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.182
And to think I spent all morning

11:45.226 --> 11:47.228
getting honey out of my sheets!

11:51.406 --> 11:53.538
Ah. Yeah.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.192
[door rattling]What?

11:55.236 --> 11:56.846
Hey, baby. Tina?

11:56.890 --> 11:58.718
The door locked accidentally.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.371
[door rattling]

12:03.766 --> 12:06.595
You thought you was slick.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.380
Lying to me
about giving Dave the key?

12:09.424 --> 12:11.556
Babe, let me explain.Oh. You're gonna explain.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.907
Mm-hmm.Okay. Wait. What you...?
Who you calling?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.473
Hey, Dave!

12:15.517 --> 12:17.475
Yeah.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.043
Can you do me a favor?
I'm at the store,

12:20.087 --> 12:22.742
and apparently, Calvin
locked himself outside.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.222
Uh-huh. [laughs]
Big dummy.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.485
Tina, come on.
Baby, I'm your husband.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.574
We were sensual last night.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.968
Oh, you will? Oh.

12:32.012 --> 12:35.232
Thanks so much, Dave.
You're the best. [laughs]

12:35.276 --> 12:36.930
And you ain't.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.411
Hey, Malcolm?

12:40.455 --> 12:42.109
Hey, Malcolm!
Malcolm, come on, man.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.285
Your mama trippin'.
Come and unlock the door!

12:45.808 --> 12:47.767
I can't help you, bruh.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.642
[door closes]

12:53.685 --> 12:56.514
Hey, Calvin, I just
got off with Tina.

12:56.558 --> 12:59.430
Got your keys
right here.

12:59.474 --> 13:02.259
Malcolm! Malcolm, come on,
open the door, please.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.609
I love you, son.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.961
I told you you
wouldn't regret this.
[laughs]

13:08.004 --> 13:11.138
All right, let me
open her up for you.All right.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.835
Okay.
Yeah.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.271
[laughs]

13:14.315 --> 13:15.838
Here we go.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.275
There we go.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.060
Why are you blocking the door?

13:20.103 --> 13:22.453
I'm not blocking the door.Okay.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.804
[laughs, mumbles]

13:24.847 --> 13:27.894
Gotta change these out.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.547
This isn't a key to
your house, is it?

13:29.591 --> 13:31.549
Of course it is.
You sure?

13:31.593 --> 13:34.291
Sure I'm sure.So if I put this key

13:34.335 --> 13:36.076
in that lock,
that door'll open?

13:36.119 --> 13:38.774
It will not.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.125
Unbelievable!
Look,

13:42.169 --> 13:44.388
Dave, no.
Let me explain it to you, Dave.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.999
Don't be like that.
Dave!

13:46.042 --> 13:48.044
Dave from the D!

13:49.524 --> 13:51.091
What are you making?

13:51.134 --> 13:52.614
Mac and cheese.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.050
I needed some comfort food.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.965
Why is it brown?

13:56.009 --> 13:58.272
All we had was chocolate milk.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.320
Sweetie, you got to get
over this Calvin thing.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.714
But we're neighbors.
We should be friends.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.629
I know you're upset,
but you do realize

14:07.672 --> 14:09.196
this is kind of your fault.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.327
How?

14:10.371 --> 14:12.025
Come on, admit it.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.896
The real reason
you gave Calvin a key

14:13.940 --> 14:15.680
is because you were hoping
he'd give you one.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.379
Like when you give me a back rub
because you want one, too.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.729
Oh, that's not true.
I don't even like back rubs.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.600
I do it because
I want to have sex.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.517
Exactly. You're not giving it
because you want to,

14:26.561 --> 14:28.824
you're giving it because
you want something in return.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.739
In fact, sometimes I
think the only reason

14:30.782 --> 14:32.567
you wave at
everybody is because

14:32.610 --> 14:34.221
you want them to wave at you.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.310
How dare you?

14:36.353 --> 14:39.008
Just saying, maybe you
should think about it

14:39.052 --> 14:42.446
while you wallow in your
disgusting pity pasta.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.668
What are you doing here?

14:46.711 --> 14:48.191
I got to get
my laundry back.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.714
Man, I'm down to
my swimming trunks.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.978
Hey.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.240
Yeah, well, I don't think
you want to be here.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.763
Moms is still not talking
to Pops,

14:54.806 --> 14:56.591
and he's blaming me
for ratting him out.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.027
Okay, well, in that case,

14:58.071 --> 14:59.768
I'm just gonna turn these
inside out.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.684
Well, well, well.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.381
If it ain't the dynamic duo:

15:04.425 --> 15:07.167
Laundry Boy and the Snitch.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.083
You know, I got a job.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.649
I could just buy some
new underwear.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.782
Hey, Marty.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.784
Mommy was just about
to fold your laundry.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.134
Hmm.Oh, yeah, and here's yours.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.919
Oh. Thanks. Okay.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.703
All right.
All right, Tina.

15:21.746 --> 15:25.272
Babe, I already apologized for
not being straight with you.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.056
I mean, what else
do you want?

15:27.100 --> 15:30.494
I want you to apologize to Dave
for lying to him.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.714
But it was one
little white lie.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.846
Yeah, to one
little white guy.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.848
[both laugh]

15:36.892 --> 15:40.548
Besides, I don't
owe him an apology.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.116
All I wanted to do
was work on my truck

15:43.159 --> 15:44.595
and live my life.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.901
But he wouldn't let it go.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.381
Oh, yeah, Pops,
you're right.

15:47.424 --> 15:48.730
You the real victim here.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.775
See?I was being sarcastic.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.603
I know, but it was working,
right?

15:53.604 --> 15:56.216
Listen, I know Dave can be
a little extra,

15:56.259 --> 15:59.001
but he's our neighbor, and you
are a better man than that.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.394
Is he?
Not really.

16:02.178 --> 16:04.224
Yes, he is.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.356
Who built the manger
for our Christmas pageant?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.620
Who fixed Old Mrs. Kim's
transmission for free?

16:09.664 --> 16:11.231
And who held a fundraiser

16:11.274 --> 16:13.624
to fix all the basketball courts
in the park?

16:13.668 --> 16:15.975
Okay. Nice try, Tina.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.889
See, I see what you're
doing right here.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.805
You're doing that thing where
you try to make me feel bad

16:20.849 --> 16:22.894
for being such a good person.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.461
It's working, isn't it?Damn right it is.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.072
Ugh.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.643
Hey, Gemma.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.949
Hey, Calvin.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.298
Is Dave here?

16:35.342 --> 16:36.865
Hold on, let me check.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.566
He says he's not here.Okay.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.003
Dave, come on, man.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.140
Calvin.

16:51.184 --> 16:54.143
Look, I shouldn't have done you
wrong like that,

16:54.187 --> 16:57.668
so I brought you a real key.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.192
No, I don't want it anymore.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.412
Come on, man, take the key.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.413
I told you I don't want it.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.067
Come on, man, take the key.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.199
No.Dave, take it.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.983
No, thank you.You know what?

17:16.122 --> 17:19.168
You really trying
to outrun me, Calvin?

17:19.212 --> 17:21.736
Yeah.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.912
You're lucky I didn't stretch.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.568
Okay, look, I realize now

17:27.611 --> 17:29.439
that I gave you this key
for the wrong reason.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.180
I was trying to force you
to be my friend.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.052
Clearly, you're not interested.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.185
[sighs] You know, Dave,
you seem like a nice guy.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.492
Thank you.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.365
But friendship
starts with trust.

17:42.409 --> 17:45.934
And for you, that may come easy,
but it doesn't for me.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.763
I mean, only trust people
that I have a history with.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.286
And that takes time.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.203
Okay.
All right.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.726
I hear you.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.076
I understand.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.468
Good. Good.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.122
You want to start to
make history right now.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.605
That's not what I meant at all.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.128
Okay. Okay.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.738
I-I've got a good idea.
Just hear me out.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.262
It's an old classic
we use at work.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.264
It's called a trust fall.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.570
Oh, no.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.138
No. I'm not doing none
of that hippy-dippity

18:16.182 --> 18:17.618
hacky sack nonsense.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.620
Calvin, please
just give me this.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.839
No. Not feeling it.

18:21.883 --> 18:25.365
Well, maybe what you're
feeling... is scared.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.194
[laughs]
I'm not scared.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.065
Prove it.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.545
Okay. All right.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.590
If I do this,
we'll be done?

18:33.634 --> 18:34.591
I promise.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.419
This is what I get

18:36.463 --> 18:38.726
for being better
than everybody else.

18:38.769 --> 18:39.944
Okay, this-this
is gonna be great.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.990
Now turn around.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.557
Okay. You got--
turn-- all right.I-I-I got it.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.428
Turn around.
Turn around,
cross your arms.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.734
[sighing]:
All right.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.083
Okay, take a
deep breath in.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.737
[inhales]
Okay.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.653
And fall back
into my arms.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.918
I can't do it, man.
I can't do it.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.573
Okay. You're doing great.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.228
Now fall back
into my arms.
Okay.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.881
Stop rushing my trust.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.448
All right?

19:05.492 --> 19:06.971
I'm-I'm gonna do it.All right.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.843
All right, I'll do it.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.453
Here we go.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.455
Arms crossed,
deep breath.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.327
And, uh...

19:14.370 --> 19:16.285
I'm falling.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.287
Oh. [chuckles]You did it.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.810
Oh, you got me. Okay.I got you.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.465
All right.Okay. Okay.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.163
Okay, now. [grunts]
Upsy-daisy.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.990
Yeah.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.818
Nah, Dave, you know,
it's like you said.

19:27.862 --> 19:31.170
You know, I'm starting to feel
something historical here.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.823
You know?
[groaning]

19:32.867 --> 19:34.303
I'm starting to feel
something, too, man.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.784
Up we go.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.829
No, you know,
get comfortable, Dave.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.527
You know, 'cause it's
like I said, you know,

19:40.570 --> 19:42.137
trust takes time.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.226
You know?

19:44.270 --> 19:46.315
So tell me about
those lakes again.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.838
You know, and where you grew up.[groaning]

19:47.882 --> 19:49.666
I always wondered about.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.712
I know it's Superior, that's
the main one, everybody knows.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.323
Is Ontario a lake?
Yeah.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.544
How far are you from Eight Mile,
where Eminem grew up? You...?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.808
Oh, man, this is great.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.114
This is like a Sleep Number bed.
It's actually very nice.

20:09.599 --> 20:12.254
[groans]

20:12.298 --> 20:14.082
Gemma.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.954
Uh, can you get me another bag
of peas for my back?

20:16.998 --> 20:18.739
This one's all mushy.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.871
I'll bring one right up.Okay.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.438
And could you bring me
some aspirin?

20:23.439 --> 20:24.919
Sure, honey.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.877
Thanks.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.097
And then maybe a snack.
Just...

20:29.140 --> 20:31.578
something salty but not crunchy.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.580
Okay, Dave.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.625
[knocking at door]

20:38.672 --> 20:39.890
Hey.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.240
Hey, Tina.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.589
I just came to check on Dave.

20:42.632 --> 20:43.894
How's his back?

20:43.938 --> 20:44.982
It's killing me.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.767
Aw.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.421
Well, tell him
to feel better.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.293
Oh, and I also wanted to
bring you a key to our house.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.121
Are you sure
it's okay with Calvin?

20:54.122 --> 20:55.950
[both laugh]

20:55.993 --> 20:57.430
Boys are stupid.
