00:44.120 --> 00:48.600
Remember, think bold!
Think bright! Think big!

00:49.280 --> 00:51.480
And when you finish
crafting your trees,

00:52.320 --> 00:55.520
the magic really begins,
the Manifestation Spell!

00:56.400 --> 00:58.720
Picture your family clearly in your mind

00:59.440 --> 01:03.160
and see them come to life
on your family trees.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.840
Wow!

01:11.000 --> 01:15.560
All of my history, now let us see,
show me my relatives on this family tree.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.240
Oh, hey, Granny Hubble.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.240
Auntie Mo.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.920
Hi, Mum!

01:25.040 --> 01:27.960
I want hearts and souls
in this work, witches.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.960
Your family tree
is an extension of who you are.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.520
Yours is more of a family twig.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.720
Well, yours is more like
a family argument.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.520
My family are just very busy, actually.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.640
Sybil!

01:59.720 --> 02:00.880
Here, Sybil!

02:01.480 --> 02:02.840
Catch it! I've got it!

02:03.120 --> 02:05.200
- Miss Drill?
- Don't let them have it.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.840
Look at me! Give it!

02:07.400 --> 02:08.680
Sybil, catch it!

02:08.960 --> 02:09.960
Good news!

02:10.680 --> 02:11.760
Oh!

02:12.240 --> 02:15.800
This year is very much a trial run,
but I know I won't be disappointed.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.840
I won't let you down, Miss Cackle.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.080
Bear in mind there may be some reluctance
from other teachers,

02:21.640 --> 02:23.080
but nothing you can't handle.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.680
Yeah!

02:28.440 --> 02:30.480
I conclude Miss Drill is very happy.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.440
Reset, girls!

02:44.720 --> 02:46.800
- Mildred Hubble!
- Sorry.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.560
You did that on purpose.
I saw you.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.360
How come your dad's not on your tree?

02:59.200 --> 03:02.720
It's quite tricky to manifest someone
when you don't know what they look like.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.120
Hasn't your father
ever wanted to meet you, Mildred?

03:09.680 --> 03:10.880
I guess not.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.080
Ethel didn't say anything
I hadn't already thought.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.280
And, anyway, I reckon my dad's
some sort of rock star wizard

03:56.360 --> 03:58.000
that didn't have any time to see me.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.920
Like my dad.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.920
Sorry.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.240
Or that he's been traveling the world
for the last 12 years

04:06.320 --> 04:07.720
and has no idea I exist.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.480
Has your mum told you anything?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.560
She once told me he was a prince
in a faraway land.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.839
But I was about five,
so I think I need an update on that story.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.959
He could be super magical.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.440
But you know your magic is passed on
through the maternal line.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.840
It comes from your mum.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
Not my mum.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.560
I almost asked about him
over the holidays,

04:30.640 --> 04:32.160
but I didn't know what to say.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.760
What if she thinks I'm not happy
and gets upset?

04:35.120 --> 04:37.720
Your mum knows you're happy.
You're like best friends.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.080
Mildred?
This had better not be a midnight feast.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.320
Just practicing my Imitation Spells.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.720
<i>♪ Let us think of them ♪</i>

04:55.040 --> 04:59.120
<i>♪ With pride ♪</i>

05:03.560 --> 05:07.080
Well met, and good morning,
dear sisters.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.600
This is a very special assembly

05:10.000 --> 05:13.680
where I have invited a sporting hero
to speak to you all.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.280
She was known as "the Star of the Sky"
just a few short years ago,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.720
and I'm sure you'll make her feel
very welcome.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.680
I give you Miss Drill!

05:31.600 --> 05:33.560
Miss Drill was the Star of the Sky!

05:35.920 --> 05:37.160
It's from Felicity.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.640
"Miss Drill to Announce Sports Day."

05:39.720 --> 05:40.920
Oh, no!

05:41.280 --> 05:44.000
Witches need to be alert...

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720
strong...

05:49.360 --> 05:50.360
and quick.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.920
Great catch, Clarice!

05:54.680 --> 05:57.680
Cat-like reflexes
are what we're striving for,

05:57.760 --> 06:02.120
and so, Physical Education, or "PE,"

06:02.200 --> 06:04.880
is one of the most important things
you'll learn

06:04.960 --> 06:06.960
whilst here at Cackle's Academy.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.360
Along with magic, I suppose.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.760
Now, now, Hecate.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.120
And I know you'll be thrilled to learn

06:14.200 --> 06:17.080
that our Second Year Sports Day
will be held tomorrow.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.440
How did she know about Sports Day
before Miss Drill has even announced it?

06:22.440 --> 06:24.800
Felicity has got eyes and ears everywhere.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.240
Since Mr. Rowan Webb
has been teaching it so successfully,

06:28.320 --> 06:31.560
this year we're adding
the Fly High Competition.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.640
I wish he wouldn't do that.
He's so disgusting.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.160
Why do you have to be so horrible
all the time? He's really nice.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.400
I'm delighted to tell you, girls,

06:46.080 --> 06:50.920
that Sports Day is finally getting
the recognition it deserves.

06:51.520 --> 06:56.320
This year, the results will count
toward your end-of-year grade!

07:00.440 --> 07:03.640
I am doomed.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.200
It's so hard to pick just two events,

07:07.280 --> 07:09.960
but for me, it's the Broomstick Hurdles
and Witchball.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.040
How are you this excited
about chasing a ball into a goal?

07:14.120 --> 07:15.520
It's a net!

07:15.840 --> 07:17.000
I should pick events

07:17.080 --> 07:19.600
where there's the least danger
of something going wrong.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.800
Which ones are you going to do?

07:22.120 --> 07:26.000
Hmm, let me think...
Maybe the Absolutely-No-Way Race,

07:26.520 --> 07:28.720
followed by
the Not-In-a-Million-Years Jump.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.400
It beats lessons.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
Sports Day's fun!

07:34.960 --> 07:36.760
At my last school, I smashed my glasses

07:36.840 --> 07:41.080
right before the hundred metres
and ran off course into a mud swamp.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.520
The whole school laughed at me.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
Sorry.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.680
My dad took about a million photos.
He's so embarrassing.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.280
I think that's sweet.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.520
Sorry, Millie.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.280
I didn't mean... you know.
I'm lucky to have him.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.480
Oh, no, it's okay.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.440
Actually, I've decided
I'm going to look for my dad.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.120
- Cool!
- How? What are you gonna do?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.080
Well, I need to find out his name.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.760
How do I find his name?

08:16.320 --> 08:19.360
Maybe I can look
at my birth certificate or...

08:19.440 --> 08:21.760
Mildred, aren't you forgetting something?

08:23.040 --> 08:24.040
What?

08:24.920 --> 08:26.520
- You're a witch!
- You're a witch!

08:29.960 --> 08:32.720
We need to get out of here soon
before we get caught.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.640
I think I know what I'm doing.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.760
What if he actually appears?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.240
He probably won't.
You're not that good.

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
True.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.640
A whisper through time,
a search into space.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.240
Give us a hint at my father's face.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.200
Give us a hint at my father's face.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.280
Give us a hint at my father's face.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.800
Give us a hint at my father's face.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.720
Helpful.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.200
Oh, it's just you lot
making all that noise.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.600
Using unauthorized magic, were we?

09:20.680 --> 09:25.000
We're trying to find Mildred's father,
so don't you dare say a word.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.480
Of course I wouldn't.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.080
Not when it's something so serious.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Good luck.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.720
I fail to see how running about
playing games

09:40.800 --> 09:43.320
can improve our witches in any way.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.400
Well, speaking as "Star of the Sky,"

09:47.480 --> 09:51.720
I can tell you that being active and fit
keeps you strong.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.680
And in my view,
that's the most important thing of all.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.000
Hey, Miss Froggy!

10:11.080 --> 10:13.280
- You kept that one quiet.
- Well, wouldn't you?

10:13.680 --> 10:14.800
Now, now, girls.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.200
Mr. Rowan Webb!

10:19.760 --> 10:22.360
What if there's someone
on your tree you didn't put there?

10:22.640 --> 10:24.440
Well, if you have strong family links,

10:24.520 --> 10:26.920
people can just pop up
when you're not expecting them.

10:28.840 --> 10:29.840
He's high up.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.320
Does that mean that...?

10:33.280 --> 10:35.040
Mr. Rowan Webb is your grandfather.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.240
He can't... He just...

10:38.320 --> 10:39.680
It's like Miss Mould said,

10:40.200 --> 10:42.960
"Some members of your family
will manifest on their own

10:43.040 --> 10:44.880
if there are strong family connections."

10:45.480 --> 10:49.600
So, Mr. Rowan Webb must be my dad's dad.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.800
Do you think he knows about you?

10:51.880 --> 10:54.800
He can't do.
He was a frog when Millie was born.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.480
But they have always got on well.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.640
It must be why I'm magic.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.320
I know magic's supposed to come
from your mum,

11:04.400 --> 11:06.760
but normal rules
don't seem to apply to me.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.680
You need to talk to him.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.560
What's on your mind, Tadpole?

11:14.920 --> 11:18.200
Something unusual happened
in art class this morning.

11:18.280 --> 11:22.720
Oh, yes, Miss Mould encourages
that sort of thing, doesn't she?

11:23.920 --> 11:28.120
- We were doing family trees...
- Trees? Oh, I love trees.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.240
Mine was pretty small, really.
More like a pot plant.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.000
But the thing about it was...

11:36.120 --> 11:38.920
was... um...

11:39.600 --> 11:41.040
What was the thing?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.280
Hmm?

11:46.800 --> 11:49.440
What I'm trying to ask is...

11:53.600 --> 11:56.000
would you give me some extra coaching
in the Fly High?

11:57.760 --> 11:58.920
The Fly High?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.320
I didn't know how to ask.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.760
I've never managed to get over the bar
without bruising something.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.800
Ah. Well, I'd be glad to.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.120
But I'm sure you don't need to worry.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.640
You're like me.

12:12.200 --> 12:16.240
Plenty of jumping experience in the pond,
if you get my drift.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.200
Hmm!

12:18.640 --> 12:21.880
Pond. Drift. Get it?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.080
No time to waste.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.680
Follow me!

12:32.280 --> 12:34.240
I also have some medals for the girls.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.040
- What a splendid idea!
- Wonderful!

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
Oh...

12:39.280 --> 12:41.760
Some people are taking this
very seriously.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.920
Rightly so,

12:43.520 --> 12:46.240
now they know
the Star of the Sky's in their midst.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.320
Indeed.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.560
Think like a frog.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.200
Ribbit.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.320
Go!

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Don't worry.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.080
We've got all afternoon.

13:05.880 --> 13:06.880
Ah!

13:06.960 --> 13:09.360
This is exactly what I need
to get out of Sports Day.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.560
If I look poorly enough,
Miss Drill will have to believe me.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.120
You're cheating?
That's not your usual style.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.160
You still don't get how much I hate
Sports Day, do you?

13:19.880 --> 13:20.920
It's very, um...

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
green.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.480
It's perfect.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.720
You should have seen us today.
It's so obvious we're related.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.080
So, why didn't you ask him?

13:34.360 --> 13:36.720
I opened my mouth,
but the words wouldn't come out.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
It's silly, really.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.720
- I hope I make him proud tomorrow.
- You will.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.440
Lights out, girls.
Busy day tomorrow.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.640
Are you sure about taking
this potion?

13:46.720 --> 13:50.040
- What potion?
- Enid will explain. I'll be fine.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.240
It's not really against the rules.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.920
I'm not using magic for bad, am I?

14:05.320 --> 14:08.200
"Take one tablespoon
for instant colour change."

14:34.840 --> 14:36.360
Midnight, it's working!

14:37.400 --> 14:39.960
Ah, time for me to practice my ill face.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.880
I've never really looked
much like my mum, have I, Tabby?

15:20.800 --> 15:21.880
It worked, then?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.840
You're... purple.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.440
What?

15:29.560 --> 15:31.560
I look like a massive bruise!

15:31.960 --> 15:32.960
What happened?

15:33.560 --> 15:35.680
I might have taken more
than I was supposed to.

15:35.760 --> 15:40.160
It says here that the colour
will wear off in 36 hours.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.040
Thirty-six hours?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.080
Maud, are you going to be okay?

15:44.160 --> 15:46.680
I'm definitely not going anywhere
near Sports Day now.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.840
I've already sent a sick note.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.840
What if someone checks?

15:51.240 --> 15:53.080
This is a disaster.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.320
Sorry, Maud, we'd better get out there.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.920
I'm gonna talk to Mr. Rowan Webb
properly today.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.960
I'm this close to finding out
about my dad.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.280
Good luck.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.280
Wish I could be there for you.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.920
Testing, testing. Hee!

16:29.480 --> 16:32.720
Whoo-hoo!

16:41.240 --> 16:45.160
I now declare Sports Day open!

16:46.440 --> 16:50.400
I think it's going to her head.
She's insufferable.

16:50.680 --> 16:54.160
I don't know.
I think she's quite inspiring.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.720
Where's Maud?

17:02.880 --> 17:05.160
She's, uh... not feeling very well.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.800
She's a berry...
I mean, I mean, very funny colour.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.680
Didn't you get her note?

17:11.760 --> 17:15.000
Sickness is not an excuse.
I've got a schedule to keep.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.880
Catch a touch of blueberry-it is, did we?

17:34.280 --> 17:37.760
I'm sorry, Miss Drill.
I just couldn't face Sports Day.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.680
So you tried to trick me
into believing you were ill?

17:42.680 --> 17:46.000
Team One to the Broomstick Hurdles

17:46.080 --> 17:49.480
and Maud Spellbody to the Fly High.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.560
Maud Spellbody to the Fly High.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.560
Uh, she's not well.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.560
I'd just mess it up.
People will laugh at me.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.600
It's important to you
to be good at things, isn't it?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.680
It feels nice to be good at things.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.000
But I'll tell you what feels even nicer.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.000
Improving.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.520
Working hard at something
even when it's difficult for you.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.200
I bet no one's ever laughed at you.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.400
Actually, they have.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.920
When I was about your age,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.680
I was showing off during
a broomstick gymnastics competition.

18:28.680 --> 18:32.920
I fell off
and everyone collapsed laughing.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.240
But now you're amazing on a broomstick.
How did that happen?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.880
I decided enough was enough.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.400
I wanted to show all those people
who laughed at me

18:42.480 --> 18:44.080
that I could be brilliant.

18:44.680 --> 18:45.760
But weren't you scared?

18:46.120 --> 18:49.440
Very! But being scared can be
a good thing.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.280
That's why I'm a sports teacher now,

18:53.080 --> 18:55.320
to help other people
be the best that they can be.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.200
I suppose I've never really tried
that hard in PE.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.480
Well, now's your chance.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.440
You know, I've wanted Sports Day
to mean something at this school

19:07.520 --> 19:09.840
for a very long time.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.560
I suppose I better show them
what purple power can really do.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.240
Maud's on her way.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.680
How do you know all this stuff?

19:21.600 --> 19:24.120
Ears to the ground, Mildred.
Ears to the ground.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.560
Fly her up, fly her high,
send her soaring through the sky!

19:36.080 --> 19:38.520
- Good luck, Tadpole.
- Thanks, Granddad.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.840
What did you say?

19:43.920 --> 19:47.120
Don't worry, I know.
Or maybe you don't know.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.320
Anyway, you popped up on my family tree.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
Me?

19:51.360 --> 19:55.360
Oh, I can't... I can't be
your granddad, Tadpole.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.320
In fact, I... I can't be
anyone's granddad.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.400
I don't have children.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.760
But... But I thought...

20:03.840 --> 20:06.280
Let's... Let's talk later, huh?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.680
You really would believe anything,
wouldn't you, Mildred Hubble?

20:13.520 --> 20:14.520
You?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.760
Did you put Mr. Rowan Webb on my tree?

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
Just a little joke.

20:26.840 --> 20:31.520
Purple power, purple power,
purple power.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.280
Maud Spellbody to the Fly High.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.480
Maud Spellbody to the Fly High.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.760
People are laughing at her.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.960
Well, Ethel, I should be thanking you.

20:48.520 --> 20:51.480
If it wasn't for your help,
I wouldn't be so good at the Fly High.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.160
I'll take Maud's turn.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.720
I might not be your granddad,

21:03.800 --> 21:08.440
but I can tell you that you are going
to be absolutely brilliant at this.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.520
Think like a frog.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.760
Correction.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.560
Mildred Hubble at the Fly High.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.320
Good luck, Mildred!

21:36.880 --> 21:39.120
That's one way to get rid of her.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.200
Maybe a dash too much frog power.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.760
I didn't know I was that good.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.920
As if being a Spellbody
wasn't embarrassing enough!

21:59.760 --> 22:00.880
Purple power.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.840
At least you can't tell how red I've gone.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.280
- Need a hand, Tadpole?
- I'm okay.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.200
Hee! Quite some distance
you managed there.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.400
I must have done something wrong.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.600
Back where it all began, eh?
No wonder you thought we were related.

22:25.680 --> 22:26.800
Yeah. Sorry about that.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.480
Oh, don't be sorry.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.680
A shame it's not true, really.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.040
If I did have a granddaughter...

22:36.040 --> 22:39.800
I'd rather like her to be just like you.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.120
I hope my granddad
will be just like you, too.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.040
If I've got one.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.680
You don't know much
about that side of the family, then?

22:51.760 --> 22:54.480
We were doing family trees
and it made me think about my dad.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.480
Who he is
and what I might be missing out on.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.960
Well, if you've got a question
about your family,

23:01.040 --> 23:03.360
isn't there someone you should ask?

23:05.840 --> 23:07.520
No one knows where you are.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.240
Another half hour won't matter.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.720
I haven't got a scrap of makeup on
on here.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.280
Ooh! Ugh!

23:26.400 --> 23:30.080
I'd normally say "Mildred shouldn't
have cheated," but look at me,

23:30.160 --> 23:31.720
I've done exactly the same thing.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.360
It was kind of my fault.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.400
I magicked the pole
because I thought you'd use it next.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.400
You magicked the pole for me?

23:41.840 --> 23:44.560
I didn't want you to worry
about being laughed at.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.160
Thanks. That means a lot.

23:52.440 --> 23:56.080
Sport was never my strongest subject,
apart from the odd bit of netball.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.960
We play Witchball here.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.480
You have to do it
without touching the ball.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.000
How do you do it without...

24:02.080 --> 24:04.240
Oh, do you know what?
I'm not even going to ask.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.680
I thought I was getting good
at the Fly High.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.200
I wondered if maybe
I'd inherited the skill.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.760
Not from me, love.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
No...

24:19.120 --> 24:20.680
from my dad.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.560
I knew this day would come.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.080
Okay.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.520
What do you want to know about him?
About your dad?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.440
Was he... magic?

24:44.960 --> 24:46.960
Training to be a plumber, he was.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.680
Dave.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.240
A magic plumber?

24:50.960 --> 24:51.960
No.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.400
And he's not a prince either.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.480
Does he know about me?

25:02.480 --> 25:05.760
We'd completely lost touch
by the time I found out I was having you.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.120
So, he's just a normal man.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.440
A lovely one, though.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.480
Kind, funny...

25:17.240 --> 25:18.240
quite clumsy.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.040
We could always have a go
at tracking him down again if you like.

25:26.880 --> 25:27.880
Maybe one day.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.680
I'm not sure I'm ready.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.040
I like hearing about him, though.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.600
Here, this will keep your glasses on.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.440
Thanks, Enid.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.560
On your marks,

25:53.560 --> 25:54.560
get set...

25:56.360 --> 25:57.360
go!

25:58.200 --> 26:00.120
- Go, Maud!
- Go, Maud!

26:10.840 --> 26:13.440
It's like being chased
by a giant beetroot.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.520
Whoa!

26:16.760 --> 26:19.200
I wasn't last! I wasn't last!
I wasn't last!

26:19.560 --> 26:22.000
- You did it!
- Great job, Maud.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.480
Thanks.
I couldn't have done it without you.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.880
Today was a very special day
at the academy.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.760
We saw witches applying themselves
at school for the very first time.

26:39.040 --> 26:44.400
Witches who overcame fear
and difficulty to take part.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.800
And witches who quite literally
went above and beyond.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.480
Well done, girls.

26:54.560 --> 26:59.400
And I'm thrilled to announce
that this will now become a yearly event.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.840
Will you please join me
in congratulating Miss Drill?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.400
It really has taken on
a life of its own overnight.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.120
You see, Mildred?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.040
Having a smaller family
doesn't make you a lesser witch.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.800
And you've always got us.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.800
Anyway, we're sisters more than friends.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.560
Maybe I've got all the family I need.
