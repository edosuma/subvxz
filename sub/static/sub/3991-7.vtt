WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:05.026
- The reason you've kept failing
to capture

00:05.070 --> 00:07.038
the Chesapeake Ripper is
I already had him.

00:07.070 --> 00:10.267
- I see the Ripper,
but I don't feel the Ripper.

00:10.310 --> 00:15.077
- Franklyn,
the lion is not in the room.
- He's, um, he's eating them.

00:15.110 --> 00:19.319
The real Chesapeake Ripper is
gonna make sure everybody
knows it.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.786
I don't think we've ever been
alone In a room together,
have we?

00:22.820 --> 00:25.311
- My name is Mariam Lass.
I'm actually just a trainee.

00:25.350 --> 00:28.114
- She was a very brave
young woman.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.357
- [Jack, it's Miriam.
I don't want to die like this.]

00:35.730 --> 00:39.734
- The Chesapeake Ripper kills
in sounders of three.

00:39.770 --> 00:43.558
He did his first victims
In nine days.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.329
Annapolis, Essex,

00:46.380 --> 00:49.543
Baltimore. He didn't kill again

00:49.580 --> 00:53.346
for 18 months. Then there was
another sounder of three
In as many days,

00:53.380 --> 00:55.439
all of them in Baltimore.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.313
I use the term

00:58.350 --> 01:02.525
"sounders" because it refers
to a small group of pIgs.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.529
That's how he sees his victims;
not as people,

01:05.560 --> 01:08.449
not as prey.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.131
Pigs.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.234
Eleven months after the sixth
victim, there was a seventh.

01:17.270 --> 01:21.673
Two days later, the eighth is
killed in his workshop.

01:21.710 --> 01:25.441
Every tool on the pegboard
where they hung was used
against him,

01:25.480 --> 01:27.448
and as with previous murders,

01:27.480 --> 01:29.641
organs were removed.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.659
The removal of organs
and abdominal mutilations means

01:32.690 --> 01:36.251
someone with anatomical
or surgIcal know-how.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.848
There...

01:37.890 --> 01:41.291
is a distinctive brutality.

01:44.300 --> 01:48.259
An FBI trainee named Miriam Lass

01:48.300 --> 01:50.803
was investigating private
medical records

01:50.840 --> 01:54.332
of all the known victims
when she disappeared.

01:54.380 --> 01:57.201
She's believed to be
the Ripper's ninth, but no trace

01:57.250 --> 01:59.241
of her_ was found--
untII recently,

01:59.280 --> 02:01.168
two years later,

02:01.220 --> 02:03.848
when her_ severed arm was
dIscovered.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.852
Only because he wanted it to be.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.491
True to

02:12.530 --> 02:14.828
his established pattern,

02:14.860 --> 02:19.832
the Chesapeake Ripper has
remained consistently
theatrical.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.843
(singing in Italian)

04:26.930 --> 04:30.696
- It's been too long since
you've properly cooked
for us, Hannibal.

04:30.730 --> 04:32.869
- Come over and I will cook
for you.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.437
- I said properly.
Means dinner and the show.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.529
Have you seen him cook?
It's an entire performance.

04:37.570 --> 04:41.734
He used to throw _
such equISIte dInner partIes.

04:41.780 --> 04:44.908
You heard me. Used to.

04:44.950 --> 04:47.373
- And I will again,
once inspiration strikes.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.845
I cannot force a feast.
A feast must present itself.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.448
- It's a dinner party,

04:53.490 --> 04:55.583
not a unicorn.
- Oh, but the feast is life.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.679
You put the life in your belly
and you live.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.891
(She chuckles.)

04:59.930 --> 05:02.421
- I believe this young man is
trying to get your attention.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.495
- Hello.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.669
- Hi. It's so good to see you.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.362
This is my friend Tobias.
- Good evening.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.675
- How do you two know
each other?

05:12.710 --> 05:14.837
- There should remain
some mystery to my lIfe

05:14.880 --> 05:17.644
outside the opera.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.410
- I'm one of his patients.

05:20.450 --> 05:24.887
- Did you enjoy the performance?
- I did. I loved it.
Every mInute.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.048
- His eyes kept wandering.
More interested

05:28.090 --> 05:30.058
in you than what was happening
on stage.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.888
- Oh, don't say too much.
You must leave something

05:32.930 --> 05:36.889
for us to discuss next week.
Franklyn, good to see you.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.797
- You _too.
- TobIas.

05:46.070 --> 05:49.107
Who's hungry?
(She chuckles.)

05:49.140 --> 05:52.348
***

06:17.540 --> 06:20.373
(phone ringing)

06:22.040 --> 06:25.942
(phone ringing)

06:25.980 --> 06:28.744
(phone ringing)

06:30.750 --> 06:33.685
(phone ringing)

06:35.920 --> 06:38.423
(phone ringing)

06:40.230 --> 06:43.461
(phone ringing)

06:45.500 --> 06:48.560
(phone ringing)

06:48.600 --> 06:52.479
(phone ringing)

06:52.510 --> 06:54.899
(vibrating and ringing)

07:11.930 --> 07:14.899
- Hello?

07:14.930 --> 07:15.453
The victim was found

07:15.500 --> 07:17.798
in a hotel room bathtub.

07:17.830 --> 07:21.038
There were abdominal mutilations
and organ removal on the scene.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.868
- Sounds more like an urban
legend than the Ripper, no?

07:23.910 --> 07:26.970
- I've had the room sealed.
You'll get it fresh.

07:27.010 --> 07:30.207
- Fresh? Fresh as a daisy?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.616
- Fresh enough for to tell me
whether or not it's the Ripper.

07:32.650 --> 07:34.572
Then you can go back to class.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.884
- Oh, you don't want me
in a classroom.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.809
You want me to wrap my head
so tight around the Ripper

07:39.860 --> 07:41.816
I won't go back to class
until he's caught.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.725
- Your bad luck
that you're the best, pal.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.853
- Expecting another couple
of bodies after this one?

07:45.890 --> 07:47.858
- If it's the Ripper,
yes, I am.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.528
- Don't let the Ripper
stir you up.

07:50.570 --> 07:54.597
The reason he left you
Miriam Lass's arm

07:54.640 --> 07:57.666
is so he could poke you
with it.

07:57.710 --> 08:00.178
- Why not the rest of her?

08:00.210 --> 08:03.179
- His other victims...

08:03.210 --> 08:05.701
he wanted to humiliate in death,

08:05.750 --> 08:08.844
like... like a public
dissection. She was different.

08:10.850 --> 08:14.854
- He was probably impressed
that she was able to find him.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.222
He may be starting
another cycle, Will.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.899
- The Ripper contacted you

08:19.930 --> 08:21.659
directly.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.794
If he was killing again,
he wouldn't be subtle about it;

08:24.830 --> 08:28.664
He would just pick up the phone.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.600
Any more phone calls, Jack?

08:30.640 --> 08:32.733
- No.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.736
Look, if this is the Ripper,
there'll be at least

08:34.780 --> 08:37.908
two more bodies and then nothing
for months, maybe a year.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.111
We'll have a window
of opportunity to catch him

08:40.150 --> 08:43.847
and that window will close.
The last time the window closed,

08:43.890 --> 08:46.950
I lost the Ripper
and I lost Miriam Lass.

08:46.990 --> 08:50.084
I don't intend to do that again.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.728
(police radio chatter)

09:00.000 --> 09:02.764
Has anyone touched the body?
- For once, local police

09:02.810 --> 09:06.132
behaved themselves.
- It's fairly evident the man's
dead just by looking at him.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.968
- I touched the body.
A lot going on with that body.

09:09.010 --> 09:11.843
Surgery was performed
and then un-performed.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.010
- Surgery was un-performed with
bare hands, sutures clawed open.

09:16.050 --> 09:19.349
I, uh, I also... did
a little bit of touching.

09:19.390 --> 09:23.156
- Pieces of him were torn off
from the bed to the bathroom,

09:23.190 --> 09:24.782
like breadcrumbs.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.909
- Surgery wasn't performed here.
There would be a lot more blood.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.931
- If he's moving his victims,
he could be

09:38.970 --> 09:41.803
performing the mutilations
in the same transport.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.842
- Find the car,
find the killer.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.771
- He tore open his own sutures.
- It wasn't to get
to his kidney.

09:47.820 --> 09:52.086
The Ripper already took it
with him. Or her.
- I'd say him.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.089
- What did he take
out of the chest?
- Going for the heart.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.281
Probably interrupted.
It's intact. Traumatized,

09:57.330 --> 10:00.219
but it's intact.

10:00.260 --> 10:01.989
- Everybody out.

10:12.210 --> 10:16.032
(soft ambient pulse)

10:41.970 --> 10:45.303
- Signs of a struggle indicate
he's suffering from a severe,

10:45.340 --> 10:48.309
violent emergence
from deep sedation.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.245
Oh!

10:55.080 --> 10:58.015
(both grunting with effort)

11:09.100 --> 11:11.091
His heart seizes up.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.175
I open his chest wall.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.939
I spread the ribs.

11:23.950 --> 11:27.317
I... I take his heart
in my hand.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.339
Internal cardiac massage.

11:40.430 --> 11:45.060
(breathing shakily)

11:45.100 --> 11:47.967
J".Jack?

11:51.510 --> 11:54.104
This wasn't brutal.

11:54.140 --> 11:57.268
The killer wasn't killing;
he was trying to save his life.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.271
The Ripper ever do that?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.784
- It's the Chesapeake Ripper.
- (Will): It's not the Ripper.

12:11.830 --> 12:16.961
- There are_ _
too many SImIIarItIes.
- There aren't enough.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.422
- Knife wounds are cuts,
not stabs.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.529
Anatomical knowledge,
dissection skills, mutilation,

12:20.570 --> 12:23.266
organs removed,
victim clothed, on display.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.904
We got 22 signature components
all attributable

12:25.940 --> 12:27.908
to the same kille_r.
- Twenty-two pos5Ible

12:27.940 --> 12:30.909
signature components.
- It's the Ripper.

12:37.450 --> 12:41.181
- Are you sure?
- More or less.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.029
- Tell me why you're sure.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.528
- The Ripper left
a victim

12:45.560 --> 12:48.529
in a church pew using his tongue
as a page marker

12:48.560 --> 12:52.064
in the Bible he was holding.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.193
This isn't that.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.037
This is a medical student

12:56.070 --> 12:58.561
or a trainee or someone trying
to make an extra buck

12:58.610 --> 13:01.101
in a back-alley surgery,
and it went bad.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.506
Actively bad.

13:07.350 --> 13:10.513
You'll catch the Ripper
eventually.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.586
- Yeah, well,
I want to catch him now.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.579
And when I do, you're not gonna
get a chance to shoot him,

13:16.620 --> 13:18.588
'cause I'm gonna do that.

13:18.630 --> 13:21.451
- You can't just jack up the law
and get underneath it.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.092
- Can't I?

13:30.970 --> 13:33.837
Tell me how you see the Ripper,
Will.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.202
- I see him

13:37.250 --> 13:42.119
as one of those
pitiful things

13:42.150 --> 13:44.084
sometimes born

13:44.120 --> 13:46.145
in hospitals.

13:46.190 --> 13:49.353
They feed it,
keep it warm,

13:49.390 --> 13:53.554
but they don't put it
on the machines.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.559
They let it die.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.160
But he doesn't die.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.601
He looks normal.

14:07.940 --> 14:10.374
And nobody can tell what he is.

14:10.410 --> 14:14.016
- Good morning. Please come in.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.067
Would you like to discuss
our chance encounter?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.590
(Franklyn chuckles.)

14:31.630 --> 14:34.098
- It wasn't
altogether by chance.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.462
I kind of... kinda thought
you'd be there--

14:37.510 --> 14:40.206
which isn't why I was there.
1-1... I was there

14:40.240 --> 14:42.208
because I like
that sort of thing.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.573
Uh, it just occurred to me
that... that you might
like it too.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.419
- In fact, I do.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.111
- I tried to get your attention.

14:49.150 --> 14:51.414
- I was aware of that.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.259
- I knew that you were aware,

14:53.290 --> 14:56.555
even though you were pretending
that you weren't.

14:56.590 --> 15:00.321
- It would be unethical
to approach a patIent

15:00.360 --> 15:03.921
or acknowledge in any way our
relationship outside this room

15:03.970 --> 15:07.337
until that patient gives
consent.

15:07.370 --> 15:10.533
- But I really don't know
who you are outside this room.

15:10.570 --> 15:13.073
- I'm your psychiatrist.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.499
- I want you to be my friend.
- Of course you do.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.576
I have intimate knowledge
of you.

15:17.610 --> 15:20.943
- And we like the same things.
I think that we would make
good friends.

15:20.980 --> 15:24.245
It makes me sad
that I have to pay to see you.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.654
(Franklyn sighs.)

15:36.660 --> 15:38.594
- I am a source of stability

15:38.630 --> 15:41.235
and clarity, Franklyn.
I'm not your friend.

15:41.270 --> 15:44.501
- I'm a great friend.

15:44.540 --> 15:48.738
I was listening to, uh,
Michael Jackson last night,

15:48.780 --> 15:53.046
and I burst into tears, and...

15:53.080 --> 15:55.947
my eyes are burning right now
just thinking about it.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.550
You know what I think is
the saddest thing

16:01.590 --> 16:07.551
about him dying is that I will
never get to meet him,

16:07.600 --> 16:10.467
and I feel like
if I was his friend

16:10.500 --> 16:13.492
that I... I would have
been able to...

16:13.540 --> 16:16.338
help save him from himself.

16:18.340 --> 16:22.003
- In this Michael Jackson
fantasy, how is your
friendship returned?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.571
- I just get to touch greatness.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.252
- Hello. Come on in.

16:39.660 --> 16:43.027
This always goes better if I'm
perfectly honest with you.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.619
- What would be the point
otherwise?

16:46.670 --> 16:50.037
- Well, one of us has
to be honest.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.731
- I'm honest.

16:51.770 --> 16:54.330
- Not perfectly.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.530
- As honest as anyone.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.344
- Not really.

16:59.380 --> 17:02.816
I have conversations
WIth a verSIon of you

17:02.850 --> 17:08.459
and hope that the actual you
gets what he needs.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.583
- A version of me?

17:10.630 --> 17:13.326
- Naturally,

17:13.360 --> 17:16.557
I respect
its meticulous construction,

17:16.600 --> 17:18.568
but you are wearing

17:18.600 --> 17:22.559
a very well-tailored
"person suit".

17:22.600 --> 17:24.739
- Do you refer to me
as "Person Suit"

17:24.770 --> 17:27.102
with your psychiatrist friends?

17:27.140 --> 17:31.440
- I don't discuss patients
with my psychiatrist friends,

17:31.480 --> 17:36.076
especially since I only have
one patient who chose to ignore

17:36.120 --> 17:38.281
my retirement.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.414
- A patient who wears
a person suit.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.578
- Maybe it's
less of a person suit
and more of a human veil.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.360
That must be lonely.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.868
- I have friends.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.095
And the opportunities
for friends.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.233
You and I are friendly.

17:59.240 --> 18:03.574
- You are my patient
and my colleague, not my friend.

18:03.610 --> 18:06.340
At the end of your hour,

18:06.380 --> 18:09.315
I will pour you
a glass of wine.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.886
Nevertheless,

18:10.920 --> 18:14.856
you will be drinking it
on the other side of the veil.

18:14.890 --> 18:17.381
- Why do you bother?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.422
- I see enough of you
to see the truth of you.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.668
And I like you.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.725
Red or white?

18:28.300 --> 18:31.633
- I think something pink,
don't you?

18:36.580 --> 18:38.138
Good evening, Will.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.579
Please come in.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.512
- Oh, you've been drinking.

18:45.550 --> 18:48.849
- I had a glass of wine
with my last appointment, yes.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.448
- Drinking with a patient.

18:50.490 --> 18:54.256
- Ah, SHE was drinking
with a patient.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.463
I have an unconventional
psychIatrIst.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.889
- Well, we have that
in common.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.165
- Am I your psychiatrist,

19:04.210 --> 19:06.804
or are we simply having
conversations?

19:06.840 --> 19:11.777
- "Yes" I think is the answer
to that.

19:11.810 --> 19:14.370
- Then having a glass of wine
before seeing a patient,

19:14.420 --> 19:17.309
I assure you,
is very conventional.

19:17.350 --> 19:20.217
Especially
for evening appointments.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.923
- Huh. How long have you been
seeing a psychiatrist?

19:23.960 --> 19:26.929
- Since I chose
to be a psychiatrist.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.332
- Thank you.

19:40.910 --> 19:46.200
- I read the Freddy Lounds
article. Chesapeake Ripper
has struck again.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.979
- No, no, no.
No, it's not the same guy.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.547
- Maybe it's never been
the same guy.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.753
- Oh, what, now he has a friend?
(Will chuckles.)

19:54.790 --> 19:56.883
- Any variations
in the murders

19:56.920 --> 20:00.356
that might suggest there could
be more than one Ripper?
- Some variations.

20:05.930 --> 20:08.364
- The victims were
all brutalized.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.903
What was the brutalization
hiding?

20:10.940 --> 20:13.738
- The careful

20:13.780 --> 20:15.839
surgical removal

20:15.880 --> 20:19.509
and preservation of vital
organs.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.511
- Valuable organs.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.284
- Organ harvesters?

20:28.320 --> 20:31.289
- Jack's looking for a serial
killer he can't seem to catch.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.992
It's a brilliant diversion.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.624
- That's an interesting theory.

20:38.970 --> 20:42.337
I will keep it in mind
if another body drops.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.759
- Please do.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.529
- (doctor): Any other
infections?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.707
- (Hannibal): You seem convinced
I'm diseased.

20:49.740 --> 20:52.948
- I was asking
a broader question.
A disease is an infection.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.312
An infection isn't
always a dIsease.

20:55.350 --> 20:57.511
- That is true.
- You should just tell me now,

20:57.550 --> 21:00.553
because I'm going to find out,
and it will affect

21:00.590 --> 21:02.956
your insurance if you lie.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.959
- May I ask
for your business card, please,

21:05.990 --> 21:08.720
for my records?

21:45.100 --> 21:47.295
- (frustrated shout): Agh!

22:08.390 --> 22:09.789
- Do you need a hand?

22:09.820 --> 22:12.755
- I think I must have hit
a rock or something.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.792
It gouged my gas tank.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.926
Have we met before?

22:32.750 --> 22:36.709
- Found him in a schoolbus
SIttIng across the aIsle
from himself.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.639
Not only did the Ripper take
his kidney...

22:42.060 --> 22:44.585
...but he also took his heart,
which, if you'll recall, is what

22:44.630 --> 22:47.690
he tried to do in the hotel but
was interrupted before he could
paint his picture.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.528
- The Ripper wasn't painting
a picture in the hotel.
Someone else was.

22:55.570 --> 22:58.164
- You_ still think that he was
rIppIng out a heart
to save a life?

22:58.210 --> 23:02.032
- Yes, I do.
- The Ripper painted
THIS picture, for sure.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.809
In big, broad strokes.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.459
- Could both victims' organs
have been harvested
for transplant?

23:14.490 --> 23:17.926
- Subtle variation on waking up
in a tub of ice missing
a kidney?

23:17.960 --> 23:20.929
- I love a good urban legend.
You could put the organs

23:20.960 --> 23:23.895
on a ventilator long enough
to coordinate the donation.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.694
- At the hotel,
the victim's abdominal aorta

23:26.730 --> 23:29.164
and inferior vena cava--
that's like the kidney's

23:29.200 --> 23:31.430
in-and-o_ut for blood--
were entIrely removed.

23:31.470 --> 23:34.974
- They're like USB cables.
You keep them intact for
an easy reconnect.

23:35.010 --> 23:36.978
- Were Mr. Caldwell's heart
and kidney disconnected

23:37.010 --> 23:39.069
for easy reconnect?
- Yeah.

23:39.110 --> 23:43.012
- Um, other Ripper victims--
organs and USB cables missing?

23:43.050 --> 23:44.608
- It's inconclusive

23:44.650 --> 23:47.016
due to the degree
of mutilation, but yes,

23:47.050 --> 23:50.679
that is how the Ripper rips.
- Two different killers,
same agenda?

23:50.730 --> 23:52.925
- Is the organ harvester
disguising his work

23:52.960 --> 23:57.158
as the crimes _
of a semi kIller, or IS
the serial killer disguising

23:57.200 --> 23:59.191
his crimes as the work
of an organ harvester?

23:59.230 --> 24:02.996
- The Chesapeake Ripper wants
to perform.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.804
Every brutal choice has...

24:05.840 --> 24:08.070
elegance,

24:08.110 --> 24:09.702
grace.

24:11.710 --> 24:15.476
His mutilations hide
the true nature of his crimes.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.580
(piano music playing)

24:20.590 --> 24:22.182
- I've been unspeakably rude.

24:22.220 --> 24:23.824
I haven't offered you a drink.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.556
- I appreciate beer
more than wine.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.627
- It's not what you appreciate;
it's that you appreciate.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.025
A compromise?

24:31.070 --> 24:34.062
Beer brewed in a wine barrel.
Two years.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.933
I bottled it myself.
(P0P!)

24:36.970 --> 24:38.961
- I'm impressed.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.181
A Cabernet Sauvignon

24:51.220 --> 24:53.609
wine barrel.
- I love your pallet.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.914
- I love your beer.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.929
I taste oak.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.928
What else do I taste in there?

25:01.960 --> 25:04.190
- I will only answer that
yes or no.

25:04.230 --> 25:07.290
- Are you serving this
at your dinner party?

25:07.330 --> 25:09.798
- No. This is your reserve.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.660
- My own private reserve?

25:11.710 --> 25:13.234
Why, thank you.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.704
- I'm curious about something.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.749
Are you purposefully avoiding
the subject of Will Graham?

25:20.780 --> 25:23.271
- Absolutely.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.538
- Not on my account, I hope.

25:25.590 --> 25:28.081
I'm happy
to get your perspective.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.953
- No, it's
on Jack Crawford's account.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.083
I don't want any information
about Will

25:33.130 --> 25:35.257
that I shouldn't have
as his friend.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.599
- Did Jack ask you
to profile the Ripper?

25:38.630 --> 25:41.963
- Not since I consulted
on the case with Miriam

25:42.000 --> 25:44.161
before she disappeared.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.633
- Crawford's trainee.
- Yeah.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.877
- Very sad.

25:48.910 --> 25:53.574
- You had me examining
PhD candidates that week.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.317
- And I'm grateful you were
examining PhD students
and not the Ripper.

25:57.350 --> 26:02.583
You realize those candidates
thought we were haVIng
an affair.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.781
Why didn't we?

26:04.830 --> 26:08.220
- You were already
having an affair.

26:08.260 --> 26:10.353
Will does that too,
you know.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.891
- What? Have affairs?

26:12.930 --> 26:16.229
- Flirtatiously change
the subject. You have
that pathology in common.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.238
- Or we just have you
in common.

26:18.270 --> 26:21.979
I recall even before I met Will,
you never spoke about him.

26:22.010 --> 26:24.205
- Probably because
I just want everybody

26:24.250 --> 26:26.605
to leave him alone.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.988
It's not even about Will.

26:31.020 --> 26:33.181
Jack's obsessed with

26:33.220 --> 26:36.018
the Chesapeake Ripper and he's
grooming Will to catch him.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.721
- And I sincerely hope
he does.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.187
(opera music)

27:57.170 --> 28:00.333
(baritone singing in Italian)

28:45.190 --> 28:47.385
- They're all missing
different organs.

28:47.420 --> 28:51.049
Before, we were looking at
waiting lists for a heart
or a kidney.

28:51.090 --> 28:53.058
Now we're looking at hearts,

28:53.090 --> 28:56.298
kidneys, livers, stomachs,

28:56.330 --> 28:58.389
pancreases, lungs.

28:58.430 --> 29:01.092
This guy,
he's missing a spleen.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.539
A spleen!

29:02.570 --> 29:06.438
Who the hell gets
a spleen transplant?

29:06.470 --> 29:09.030
- Intestines are the only organ
missing from this body?

29:09.080 --> 29:11.071
- Yes, right, so we're either
looking for someone

29:21.560 --> 29:24.358
- He's selling
these organs to someone.

29:24.390 --> 29:26.858
_ - We don't even know
If he's transplantIng them

29:26.890 --> 29:30.496
within the US. He could
be exporting them to China.
- The Chinese have a cultural

29:30.530 --> 29:32.828
taboo that restricts voluntary
donation. You gotta die

29:32.870 --> 29:34.929
with all your parts
or you dishonor Mommy and Daddy.

29:34.970 --> 29:37.495
- I mean, you could still kill
a guy for parts. That doesn't
break that taboo.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.337
- I was agreeing with you.

29:39.370 --> 29:42.931
Well, I was.
- Your tone was a little...

29:42.980 --> 29:45.801
- (Jack): OK, OK.
(They clear their throats.)

29:45.850 --> 29:47.442
How many killers?

29:47.480 --> 29:49.243
- Two.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.248
- You confident one of them is
the Chesapeake Ripper?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.542
- At least one of them, yep.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.159
- Good morning.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.054
Please come in.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.867
- I discovered
that we are cheese folk.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.372
I saw you shopping for cheese.
I didn't say hello,

30:17.410 --> 30:20.140
because you were
so uncomfortable the last time

30:20.180 --> 30:21.909
that I did.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.918
- This city is very small.

30:23.950 --> 30:26.248
- Yes. Jos's.

30:26.290 --> 30:30.056
Jos's has the best selection
of artisanal cheeses

30:30.090 --> 30:32.183
in Baltimore, city or county.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.959
(Franklyn chuckles.)

30:34.000 --> 30:36.218
Cheese is my passion.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.228
You ever heard of tyromancy?

30:38.270 --> 30:41.239
- Divination by cheese.

30:41.270 --> 30:43.932
- It was my gateway to cheeses.

30:43.970 --> 30:48.407
It was like a Magic 8 Ball
that you can eat.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.943
Tobias, he, um...

30:50.980 --> 30:52.971
he doesn't eat dairy.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.514
- Do you desire Tobias sexually?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.357
- No.

31:03.390 --> 31:06.655
God, no. Uh... no.

31:06.690 --> 31:10.228
Not to_ be defensive.
I just, um...

31:10.260 --> 31:12.490
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I was in a "fraternity".

31:12.530 --> 31:14.634
I-I-I tried things, you know?

31:14.670 --> 31:16.365
Uh, um...

31:16.400 --> 31:18.561
It's just not my brand.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.499
- You care deeply about Tobias

31:21.540 --> 31:23.371
despite differences.

31:23.410 --> 31:26.948
He's your best friend,
but you're not his.

31:26.980 --> 31:29.972
- Well, it's sad when you say it
like that.

31:32.450 --> 31:35.180
- You often worry
about being alone?

31:35.220 --> 31:38.257
- I worry about hurting.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.654
Being alone comes with a...

31:42.700 --> 31:44.668
a dull ache.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.668
Doesn't it?

31:46.700 --> 31:49.066
- It can.

31:51.070 --> 31:55.074
(Requiem, "Lacrimosa",
by Mozart)

33:06.150 --> 33:08.368
- It's better that it's
just the two of us.

33:11.350 --> 33:13.511
- (Hannibal): Will?

33:13.550 --> 33:15.279
- Dad.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.584
- Yes?

33:17.620 --> 33:19.485
- There's someone else here.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.764
- Will?

33:26.800 --> 33:28.392
Will?

33:35.080 --> 33:37.776
I have a 24-hour
cancellation policy.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.745
- What time is it?

33:41.780 --> 33:43.475
- Nearly nine o'clock.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.482
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No apology necessary.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.753
- I must have
fallen asleep.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.728
Was I sleepwalking?

33:57.760 --> 33:59.466
- Your eyes were open,

33:59.500 --> 34:02.492
but you were not present.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.132
- Jeez.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.074
I felt as if I was asleep.

34:08.110 --> 34:11.705
I need to stop sleeping
altogether.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.241
Best way
to avoid bad dreams.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.217
- Well, I can see

34:18.250 --> 34:20.286
why you have bad dreams.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.551
- What do you see, Doctor?

34:27.130 --> 34:29.348
- Sum up the Ripper
in so many words?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.753
- Choose them wisely.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.098
- Oh, I always do.

34:33.130 --> 34:36.588
Words are living things.
They have personality,

34:36.640 --> 34:38.608
point of view,

34:38.640 --> 34:40.608
agenda.

34:40.640 --> 34:43.837
- They're pack hunters.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.246
- Displaying one's enemy
after death

34:46.280 --> 34:48.510
has its appeal
in many cultures.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.518
- These aren't_
the RIpper's enemIes,

34:50.550 --> 34:52.745
these are pests
he's swatted.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.115
- Their reward
for their cruelty.

34:57.160 --> 35:00.527
- Oh, he doesn't have a problem
with cruelty.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.529
Their reward is
for undignified behavior.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.529
These_dissections are
to dIsgrace them.

35:06.570 --> 35:09.562
It's... it's
a public shaming.

35:11.570 --> 35:13.401
- Takes their organs away

35:13.440 --> 35:16.273
because, in his mind,
they don't deserve them.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.709
- In some way.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.518
- Who's this?

35:27.550 --> 35:29.518
- It's Jack_ Crawford's
traInee.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.528
She's not like
the other victims.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.791
The Ripper had no reason
to humiliate Miriam Lass.

35:34.830 --> 35:38.197
- Seems _to me
he was humIIIatIng someone.

35:38.230 --> 35:40.494
- Yeah, he was
humiliating Jack.

35:40.530 --> 35:43.397
- Did it work?

35:45.410 --> 35:47.605
- I'd say it worked
really well.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.910
- I've been looking for
the kill truck--a van or SUV--

35:59.950 --> 36:03.750
but it was a whole lot easier
than that.

36:03.790 --> 36:06.759
- What am I looking at here?
- One of the hotel security
cameras.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.395
- Kill truck?
- It's a prIvate ambulance.

36:09.430 --> 36:12.627
- The city works with dozens
of private ambulance companies.
- Including this one,

36:12.670 --> 36:16.162
but not as a first responder.
A first responder driving
away from the emergency?

36:18.970 --> 36:21.165
- Have a seat.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.949
- Ambulance would be
a smart place to perform

36:25.980 --> 36:27.845
surgery. If the cops show up,

36:27.880 --> 36:30.610
blend in and drive away.

36:35.290 --> 36:37.485
- Where's Will Graham?

36:37.520 --> 36:39.488
Will. There you are.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.852
And Dr. Lecter.
What a surprise. We have a lead.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.767
Would you care to, uh, help us
catch the Ripper?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.530
- How could I refuse?

36:48.570 --> 36:52.358
- That ambulance isn't
in rotation. It hasn't
even been out of the shed.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.503
- Surveillance footage says
it has been.

36:54.540 --> 36:57.509
- Well, nobody's signed her out.
My road sheet's got her down
for repairs.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.508
- And who signed her in
for repairs?

36:59.550 --> 37:01.518
- Devon Silvestri. He's one
of our part-tIme drIvers.

37:01.550 --> 37:04.542
- Does he want to be a doctor?
- He's taking the MCATs.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.286
- What?

37:07.320 --> 37:08.810
- It was there this morning.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.680
- It was there this morning.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.553
Well. Is Mr. Silvestri working

37:13.590 --> 37:15.626
today?
- He's not on the schedule.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.924
- Is there GPS
on that ambulance?

37:17.960 --> 37:20.929
- Mm-hmm. _
- Encrypted messagIng,
or remote tracking?

37:20.970 --> 37:23.598
- We can't afford that kind of
hardware. We use consumer grade.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.507
- Digital trunk system.
- Yeah.

37:26.540 --> 37:30.579
-_Jack. If the ambulance radio
Is on, I can use a DF sweep
to find it.

37:30.610 --> 37:32.942
- Good.

37:32.980 --> 37:36.245
- This is very educational.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.784
- Show me your hands.
- I can't.

38:11.820 --> 38:15.358
- Show me your hands.

38:15.390 --> 38:19.326
- He'll die.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.021
- Dr. Lecter!

38:27.930 --> 38:30.535
I need you to assess
the situation here, Doctor.

38:36.580 --> 38:39.344
- He was removing his kidney.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.041
Pooﬂy.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.878
I can stop the bleeding.
- Do it.

38:56.130 --> 38:59.361
Have you got it?
- I've got it.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.789
- Mr. Silvestri, put your hands
behind your head

39:01.840 --> 39:05.936
and exit the vehicle slowly.
Do it.

39:05.970 --> 39:09.929
(classical choral music)

39:09.980 --> 39:11.971
On the ground. On your knees.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.071
(handcuffs clicking)

39:31.700 --> 39:34.931
(Violin Concerto in F minor,
RV 297, "Largo", by Vivaldi)

40:04.030 --> 40:07.420
- I have a butcher who carries
sow's blood.

40:07.470 --> 40:09.461
Centrifugate--

40:09.500 --> 40:11.604
separate the matter
from the water--

40:20.010 --> 40:21.978
Serve with tomatoes
In suspenSIon

40:22.020 --> 40:24.443
and everybody will
love the sweet taste.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.048
Are you sure you can't stay?

40:26.090 --> 40:28.615
- Uh, I don't think
I would be good company.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.480
- I disagree.

40:32.490 --> 40:34.651
But before you go,

40:34.700 --> 40:37.123
what became
of Mr. Sylvestri's donor?

40:37.160 --> 40:39.025
- You saved his life.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.837
- Been a long time
since I used a scalpel
on anything but a pencil.

40:44.870 --> 40:47.737
- Why'd you stop being
a surgeon?

40:47.770 --> 40:50.739
- I killed someone--
or, more accurately,

40:50.780 --> 40:52.998
I couldn't save someone.
But it felt like killing them.

40:53.050 --> 40:56.019
- You were an emergency room
surgeon. It has to happen
from time to time.

40:56.050 --> 40:58.883
- It happened one time too many.

40:58.920 --> 41:02.151
I transferred my passion for
anatomy into the culinary arts.

41:02.190 --> 41:05.159
I fix minds instead of bodies,

41:05.190 --> 41:07.681
and no one's died as a result
of my therapy.

41:07.730 --> 41:09.698
(Will chuckles.)

41:09.730 --> 41:11.891
- I have to go.

41:11.930 --> 41:15.195
I have a date
with the Chesapeake Ripper.

41:15.240 --> 41:20.064
- Or is that Rippers?
- Devon Silvestri was harvesting
organs, but not with the Ripper.

41:20.110 --> 41:22.078
There's no connection
between them.

41:22.110 --> 41:24.806
- Jack must be devastated.

41:24.850 --> 41:27.000
- I imagine he is.

41:30.250 --> 41:31.808
Enjoy the wine.

41:31.850 --> 41:33.249
- Thank you.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.072
(applause)

42:13.930 --> 42:17.855
Before we begin,
you must all be warned:

42:17.900 --> 42:20.869
nothing here... is vegetarian.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.595
(quiet chuckles)

42:22.640 --> 42:24.631
Bon apptit.
