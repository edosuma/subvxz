01:07.117 --> 01:08.327
Towels.

01:38.608 --> 01:39.901
Lord Miraz?

01:40.819 --> 01:42.362
You have a son.

01:45.740 --> 01:48.368
The heavens have blessed us.

01:51.079 --> 01:53.373
You know your orders.

01:58.002 --> 01:59.879
General Glozelle?

02:02.257 --> 02:04.050
Yes, my lord.

02:38.752 --> 02:39.837
Five more minutes.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.798
Won't be watching
the stars tonight, my prince.

02:42.882 --> 02:44.884
Come. We must hurry.

02:48.012 --> 02:51.265
- Professor, what's going on?
- Your aunt has given birth...

02:52.475 --> 02:53.768
...to a son.

02:59.190 --> 03:00.441
Come.

03:51.159 --> 03:53.328
You must make for the woods.

03:53.411 --> 03:55.789
- The woods?
- They won't follow you there.

03:58.917 --> 04:01.586
It has taken me
many years to find this.

04:03.713 --> 04:06.758
Do not use it except
at your greatest need.

04:06.842 --> 04:09.010
Will I ever see you again?

04:09.094 --> 04:12.097
I dearly hope so, my prince.

04:12.180 --> 04:15.976
There is so much more
I meant to tell you.

04:16.059 --> 04:19.730
Everything you know
is about to change.

04:19.814 --> 04:21.899
Close the drawbridge!

04:22.525 --> 04:23.985
Now, go.

04:29.782 --> 04:31.993
- Halt!
- Halt!

04:47.842 --> 04:50.094
A son! A son!

04:50.178 --> 04:54.724
Lady Prunaprismia has this night
given Lord Miraz a son!

05:47.736 --> 05:51.698
Which of you superstitious old women
wants to spend the night in a cell?

08:04.042 --> 08:05.544
He's seen us.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.226
Take care of him.

08:27.899 --> 08:29.901
No!

08:34.197 --> 08:37.284
- Mind yourself, love.
- I'm sorry.

08:37.366 --> 08:39.077
Watch where you're going!

08:39.160 --> 08:40.828
Wait for me!

08:54.010 --> 08:56.554
You go to Saint Finbar's?

08:56.637 --> 08:57.805
That's right.

08:57.889 --> 09:01.267
I go to Hendon House.
Across the road.

09:02.393 --> 09:03.853
I've seen you...

09:05.438 --> 09:06.898
...sitting by yourself.

09:09.442 --> 09:13.029
Yes, well, I prefer to be left alone.

09:15.490 --> 09:16.991
Me, too.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.118
What's your name?

09:21.245 --> 09:23.498
- Phyllis.
- Susan!

09:25.833 --> 09:27.877
You'd better come quickly.

09:31.756 --> 09:33.257
Paper here!

09:34.300 --> 09:35.968
Get your daily paper!

10:13.841 --> 10:14.883
Edmund!

10:17.386 --> 10:19.429
Go on! Kick him in the face!

10:32.317 --> 10:34.987
Stop it. Break it up.
That's enough. Come on.

10:36.363 --> 10:38.198
That's it. Get up.

10:39.408 --> 10:40.535
Act your age!

10:49.461 --> 10:52.255
- You're welcome.
- I had it sorted.

10:53.882 --> 10:55.425
What was it this time?

10:56.426 --> 10:58.970
- He bumped me.
- So you hit him?

10:59.053 --> 11:03.475
No. After he bumped me,
they tried to make me apologise.

11:03.558 --> 11:05.268
- That's when I hit him.
- Really?

11:05.351 --> 11:08.480
- Is it that hard just to walk away?
- I shouldn't have to.

11:08.563 --> 11:11.691
I mean, don't you ever get tired
of being treated like a kid?

11:11.775 --> 11:13.359
We are kids.

11:13.443 --> 11:15.320
Well, I wasn't always.

11:16.738 --> 11:18.406
It's been a year.

11:19.824 --> 11:21.910
How long does he expect us to wait?

11:21.993 --> 11:24.579
I think it's time to accept
that we live here.

11:24.662 --> 11:27.123
It's no use pretending any different.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.419
Oh, no.

11:33.129 --> 11:36.300
- Pretend you're talking to me.
- We are talking to you.

11:38.636 --> 11:41.347
- Quiet, Lu.
- Something pinched me!

11:41.430 --> 11:42.932
- Stop pulling!
- Not touching you.

11:43.015 --> 11:46.268
Look, would all of you just...
What is that?

11:46.352 --> 11:48.687
- It feels like magic.
- Everyone hold hands.

11:48.771 --> 11:50.773
- I'm not holding your hand!
- Just...

12:57.382 --> 12:59.301
Shame you're not as quick as me, Ed!

12:59.384 --> 13:01.720
Last one in's a rotten egg.

13:01.803 --> 13:02.929
Watch out!

13:04.556 --> 13:06.224
Here it comes!

13:14.608 --> 13:16.276
Wait a minute!

13:20.030 --> 13:21.740
Come on, Susan. Hurry up!

13:22.532 --> 13:24.368
Come on, it's lovely.

13:26.579 --> 13:27.955
Edmund.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.543
Ed? Ed!

13:37.590 --> 13:40.718
- What is it?
- Where do you suppose we are?

13:40.802 --> 13:42.637
Well, where do you think?

13:42.720 --> 13:45.598
Well, I don't remember
any ruins in Narnia.

14:38.861 --> 14:40.612
Wonder who lived here.

14:48.328 --> 14:50.372
I think we did.

14:58.714 --> 15:00.215
Hey, that's mine.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.759
- From my chess set.
- Which chess set?

15:02.843 --> 15:06.263
I didn't exactly have a solid gold
chess set in Finchley, did I?

15:11.852 --> 15:13.313
Can't be.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.655
- Don't you see?
- What?

15:24.574 --> 15:25.867
Imagine walls.

15:28.912 --> 15:30.497
And columns, there.

15:35.043 --> 15:37.462
And a glass roof.

15:45.929 --> 15:47.430
Cair Paravel.

16:23.259 --> 16:26.345
Wait. Wait, my lord.
It is not what you think.

16:26.428 --> 16:28.681
Then what is it?

16:28.764 --> 16:30.599
We're not exactly sure.

16:35.938 --> 16:37.857
Impossible.

16:47.366 --> 16:51.787
I warned this council when it
put its trust in Lord Miraz...

16:52.913 --> 16:55.374
...there would be consequences.
- No.

16:55.458 --> 16:58.335
We can't accuse
the Lord Protector without proof.

16:58.419 --> 17:01.505
How long are we going
to hide behind that excuse?

17:01.590 --> 17:04.800
Until every chair
in this chamber is empty?

17:06.261 --> 17:10.015
Lords of the council,
my apologies for being late.

17:10.098 --> 17:12.893
I wasn't aware we were in session.

17:13.518 --> 17:16.021
No doubt you were otherwise occupied.

17:18.732 --> 17:20.233
My lord?

17:20.983 --> 17:24.112
Ever since the death
of Caspian the ninth,

17:24.195 --> 17:27.574
you've behaved
as if you were king.

17:27.656 --> 17:31.870
Now it seems that from behind his walls
even Prince Caspian has gone missing.

17:32.871 --> 17:35.874
My deepest condolences, Lord Miraz.

17:36.416 --> 17:39.586
Imagine, losing your nephew,

17:39.669 --> 17:42.088
the rightful heir to the throne,

17:42.172 --> 17:45.717
on the very night your wife
has blessed you with a son.

17:47.093 --> 17:49.471
Thank you, Lord Sopespian.

17:49.554 --> 17:52.891
Your compassion is a boon
in this troubled time.

17:52.974 --> 17:56.687
I trust you can tell us how such
a tragedy could have occurred.

18:02.568 --> 18:05.655
That is the most
disturbing news of all.

18:10.409 --> 18:15.123
Our beloved Caspian was abducted...

18:18.501 --> 18:20.545
...by Narnians.

18:21.587 --> 18:23.589
You go too far, Miraz.

18:23.673 --> 18:28.344
Expect us to stand by while you blame
such a blatant crime on fairy tales?

18:35.017 --> 18:36.310
What?

18:38.855 --> 18:43.234
We forget, my lords,
Narnia was once a savage land.

18:44.485 --> 18:46.571
Fierce creatures roamed free.

18:47.905 --> 18:51.577
Much of our forefathers' blood was shed

18:51.660 --> 18:54.246
to exterminate this vermin.

19:00.169 --> 19:02.588
Or so we thought.

19:03.380 --> 19:06.633
But while we've been bickering
amongst ourselves...

19:08.260 --> 19:12.973
...they've been breeding
like cockroaches under a rock!

19:13.056 --> 19:16.768
Growing stronger. Watching us.

19:19.688 --> 19:21.815
Waiting to strike!

19:26.361 --> 19:30.282
And you wonder why we don't like you.

19:31.742 --> 19:35.412
Well, I intend to strike back.

19:37.414 --> 19:41.251
Even if I have to cut down
the entire forest,

19:41.335 --> 19:45.298
I assure you,
I will find Prince Caspian

19:45.381 --> 19:49.552
and finish what our ancestors began.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.697
- Catapults.
- What?

20:10.990 --> 20:15.161
This didn't just happen.
Cair Paravel was attacked.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.920
Don't suppose you have
any matches, do you?

21:06.881 --> 21:08.257
No, but...

21:09.341 --> 21:10.843
...would this help?

21:10.926 --> 21:13.762
You might have mentioned that
a bit sooner.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.642
I can't believe it.
It's all still here.

22:12.155 --> 22:14.741
I was so tall.

22:14.825 --> 22:16.827
Well, you were older then.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.706
As opposed to hundreds of years
later... when you're younger.

22:35.763 --> 22:38.015
- What is it?
- My horn.

22:38.099 --> 22:41.561
I must've left it on my saddle
the day we went back.

23:03.207 --> 23:06.627
When Aslan bares his teeth,
winter meets its death.

23:08.296 --> 23:10.131
When he shakes his mane...

23:12.049 --> 23:13.718
...we shall have spring again.

23:17.680 --> 23:23.102
Everyone we knew...
Mr Tumnus and the Beavers...

23:25.814 --> 23:27.065
...they're all gone.

23:34.364 --> 23:36.867
I think it's time we found out
what's going on.

23:50.339 --> 23:51.965
He won't stop staring.

23:52.674 --> 23:54.009
So don't look.

24:07.356 --> 24:09.066
Here's far enough.

24:18.409 --> 24:19.661
Drop him!

24:19.744 --> 24:22.080
Crows and crockery!

25:04.873 --> 25:06.458
'Drop him'!

25:09.043 --> 25:11.504
That's the best
you can come up with?

25:11.588 --> 25:13.716
A simple 'thank you' would suffice.

25:13.799 --> 25:16.677
They were doing fine
drowning me without your help.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.471
Maybe we should have let them.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.682
Why were they trying
to kill you, anyway?

25:23.309 --> 25:26.228
They're Telmarines.
That's what they do.

25:26.312 --> 25:29.523
Telmarines? In Narnia?

25:29.607 --> 25:32.735
Where have you been
for the last few hundred years?

25:33.736 --> 25:35.362
It's a bit of a long story.

25:44.830 --> 25:47.750
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.086
You're it?

25:51.170 --> 25:54.089
You're the kings and queens of old?

25:55.424 --> 25:57.927
High King Peter, the Magnificent.

25:58.761 --> 26:01.180
You probably could've
left off the last bit.

26:02.807 --> 26:04.266
Probably.

26:06.310 --> 26:07.646
You might be surprised.

26:09.689 --> 26:12.609
You don't want to do that, boy.

26:12.692 --> 26:14.736
Not me. Him.

26:32.295 --> 26:33.505
Edmund!

26:33.588 --> 26:36.383
You all right?

26:56.236 --> 26:58.280
Beards and bedsteads!

26:58.363 --> 27:01.199
Maybe that horn worked after all.

27:02.076 --> 27:03.327
What horn?

27:23.139 --> 27:25.975
This bread is so stale.

27:26.058 --> 27:29.520
I'll just get him some soup.
He should be coming around soon.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.856
I don't think
I hit him hard enough.

27:31.939 --> 27:33.608
Nikabrik, he's just a boy.

27:33.691 --> 27:38.070
He's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy.
You said you were gonna get rid of him.

27:38.154 --> 27:41.657
No. I said I'd take care of him.

27:41.741 --> 27:45.036
We can't kill him now.
I just bandaged his head.

27:45.119 --> 27:48.080
It would be like murdering a guest.

27:48.164 --> 27:50.500
How do you think his friends
are treating their guest?

27:50.583 --> 27:54.170
Trumpkin knew what he was doing.
It's not the boy's fault.

27:58.592 --> 28:00.052
Stop! Stop!

28:00.803 --> 28:02.846
Hold it. No, no!

28:02.930 --> 28:05.974
I told you we should have killed him
when we had the chance.

28:06.058 --> 28:09.269
- You know why we can't.
- If we're taking a vote, I'm with him.

28:09.353 --> 28:11.438
We can't let him go. He's seen us.

28:11.522 --> 28:13.106
That's enough, Nikabrik!

28:13.190 --> 28:15.317
Or do I have to sit on your head again?

28:16.985 --> 28:19.696
And you. Look what you made me do.

28:20.697 --> 28:22.991
I spent half the morning on that soup.

28:24.493 --> 28:26.203
What are you?

28:26.286 --> 28:29.581
You know, it's funny
that you would ask that.

28:29.665 --> 28:32.084
You think people would know
a badger when they saw one.

28:32.167 --> 28:33.710
No. No, I mean...

28:35.212 --> 28:38.465
...you're Narnians.
You're supposed to be extinct.

28:39.258 --> 28:40.801
Sorry to disappoint you.

28:44.179 --> 28:47.516
Here you go. Still hot.

28:47.599 --> 28:51.104
Since when did we open a boarding house
for Telmarine soldiers?

28:51.187 --> 28:52.438
I'm not a soldier.

28:53.481 --> 28:57.152
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.321
What are you doing here?

29:02.490 --> 29:04.033
Running away.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.957
My uncle has always wanted my throne.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.254
I suppose I have only lived this long

29:16.337 --> 29:18.965
because he did not have
an heir of his own.

29:21.384 --> 29:25.930
- Well, that changes things.
- Yeah.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.308
Means we don't have
to kill you ourselves.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.643
You're right.

29:32.770 --> 29:35.899
- Where are you going?
- My uncle won't stop until I am dead.

29:35.982 --> 29:39.569
But you can't leave.
You're meant to save us.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.156
Don't you know what this is?

30:10.434 --> 30:13.020
You have quite a library, doctor.

30:16.065 --> 30:19.985
Is there anything particular
you seek, my lord?

30:20.069 --> 30:23.531
I think I've already found
what I'm looking for...

30:25.616 --> 30:28.410
...in one of my soldiers!

30:47.180 --> 30:50.350
What do you know
of Queen Susan's horn?

30:51.059 --> 30:53.728
It was said to be magic.

30:53.812 --> 30:55.438
Magic?

30:55.522 --> 31:00.610
The Narnians believed it could summon
their kings and queens of old.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.739
At least, such was the superstition.

31:07.534 --> 31:11.872
And what does Caspian
know of this superstition?

31:11.955 --> 31:17.127
My lord, you forbade me
from mentioning the old tales.

31:19.129 --> 31:21.256
So I did.

31:27.888 --> 31:33.059
I will say this. If Caspian
does know of the Deep Magic,

31:33.143 --> 31:36.481
my lord would have
good reason to be nervous.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.206
First our prince...

31:54.040 --> 31:55.625
...now his tutor.

31:55.708 --> 31:58.878
If the members of Miraz's
own house are not safe,

31:58.961 --> 32:02.298
- are any of us?
- Lord Sopespian!

32:02.381 --> 32:05.343
Those are dangerous words,
Lord Sopespian.

32:05.426 --> 32:08.179
But these are
dangerous times, general.

32:08.721 --> 32:13.267
One should choose his words
as carefully as he chooses his friends.

32:18.189 --> 32:21.359
How long until the bridge is finished?

32:21.442 --> 32:24.946
- Construction continues on schedule.
- That's not good enough.

32:25.029 --> 32:27.281
I need my army across that river now.

32:27.365 --> 32:30.494
May I suggest you contribute
some of your own men?

32:30.577 --> 32:32.788
I've only so many at my disposal.

32:33.330 --> 32:36.291
A fact you'd be wise to remember.

32:38.460 --> 32:40.003
Go to Beruna.

32:40.087 --> 32:44.466
Take as many troops as you need.
We must get to Caspian before they do.

32:45.717 --> 32:47.052
'They,' my lord?

32:47.136 --> 32:49.930
It's time you learned your history.

33:20.002 --> 33:21.211
They're so still.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.968
They're trees. What'd you expect?

33:29.137 --> 33:30.805
They used to dance.

33:32.891 --> 33:35.935
Wasn't long after you left
that the Telmarines invaded.

33:37.312 --> 33:39.856
Those who survived
retreated to the woods.

33:39.939 --> 33:42.400
And the trees,

33:42.484 --> 33:47.113
they retreated so deep into themselves
that they haven't been heard from since.

33:47.197 --> 33:51.242
I don't understand.
How could Aslan have let this happen?

33:51.326 --> 33:52.619
Aslan?

33:53.328 --> 33:55.997
Thought he abandoned us
when you lot did.

34:01.002 --> 34:03.087
We didn't mean to leave, you know.

34:04.464 --> 34:06.800
Makes no difference now, does it?

34:06.883 --> 34:09.344
Get us to the Narnians...

34:09.969 --> 34:11.471
...and it will.

34:49.092 --> 34:50.302
Hello, there.

34:55.349 --> 34:58.310
It's all right. We're friends.

35:04.775 --> 35:06.193
Don't move, Your Majesty.

35:13.743 --> 35:15.203
Stay away from her!

35:19.583 --> 35:20.959
Shoot, Susan! Shoot!

35:34.639 --> 35:38.768
- Why wouldn't he stop?
- I suspect he was hungry.

35:53.658 --> 35:54.826
Thanks.

35:57.913 --> 35:59.498
He was wild.

36:01.166 --> 36:03.335
I don't think he could talk at all.

36:04.544 --> 36:07.215
Get treated like
a dumb animal long enough,

36:07.298 --> 36:09.217
that's what you become.

36:11.385 --> 36:14.764
You may find Narnia a more savage place
than you remember.

36:33.282 --> 36:34.951
I can hear you.

36:37.745 --> 36:40.957
I just think we should wait
for the kings and queens.

36:42.708 --> 36:45.878
Fine! Go then! See if the others
will be as understanding!

36:45.962 --> 36:47.505
Or maybe I'll come with you.

36:47.588 --> 36:50.216
I want to see you
explain things to the minotaurs.

36:51.801 --> 36:53.010
Minotaurs?

36:54.428 --> 36:55.596
They're real?

36:55.680 --> 36:57.140
And very bad-tempered.

36:57.223 --> 37:00.560
- Yeah, not to mention big.
- Huge.

37:01.895 --> 37:04.773
What about centaurs?
Do they still exist?

37:04.857 --> 37:07.818
Well, the centaurs will
probably fight on your side.

37:07.901 --> 37:10.946
But there's no telling
what the others will do.

37:12.906 --> 37:14.408
What about Aslan?

37:19.955 --> 37:22.416
How do you know so much about us?

37:22.499 --> 37:25.169
- Stories.
- Wait a minute.

37:25.252 --> 37:27.921
Your father told you
stories about Narnia?

37:28.797 --> 37:30.466
No, my professor, he...

37:32.718 --> 37:33.760
Listen, I'm sorry.

37:33.844 --> 37:37.681
These are not the kind of questions
you should be asking.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.478
- What is it?
- Human.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.189
- Him?
- No. Them.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.944
- There they are!
- Run!

38:03.458 --> 38:04.876
Now!

38:14.385 --> 38:16.554
- Oh, no.
- Wait. I'll go.

38:22.268 --> 38:25.063
Take it. Go!
It's more important than I am.

38:58.347 --> 39:00.266
Get him out of here.

39:10.818 --> 39:12.069
Where are you?

39:28.002 --> 39:31.881
Choose your last words
carefully, Telmarine.

39:33.340 --> 39:34.592
You are a mouse.

39:36.427 --> 39:39.138
I was hoping for something
a little more original.

39:39.221 --> 39:40.639
Pick up your sword.

39:44.101 --> 39:45.395
No, thanks.

39:45.479 --> 39:48.732
Pick it up! I will not fight
an unarmed man.

39:48.815 --> 39:50.859
Which is why I might live longer

39:50.942 --> 39:53.778
if I choose not to cross blades
with you, noble mouse.

39:53.862 --> 39:57.365
I said I would not fight you.
I didn't say I'd let you live!

39:57.449 --> 39:59.117
Reepicheep!

39:59.201 --> 40:01.286
- Stay your blade!
- Trufflehunter?

40:01.369 --> 40:05.457
I trust you have a very good reason
for this untimely interruption.

40:05.540 --> 40:09.002
- He doesn't. Go ahead.
- He's the one who blew the horn.

40:10.962 --> 40:14.049
- What?
- Then let him bring it forward.

40:17.677 --> 40:20.472
This is the reason we have gathered.

40:26.186 --> 40:27.479
I don't remember this way.

40:27.562 --> 40:30.732
That's the problem with girls.
You can't carry a map in your heads.

40:30.816 --> 40:33.944
That's because our heads
have something in them.

40:34.027 --> 40:37.614
I wish he'd just listen
to the D.L.F. in the first place.

40:37.697 --> 40:40.827
- D.L.F.?
- Dear Little Friend.

40:42.411 --> 40:45.581
Oh, that's not at all
patronising, is it?

40:48.709 --> 40:50.878
I'm not lost.

40:50.962 --> 40:52.046
No.

40:53.631 --> 40:56.175
You're just going the wrong way.

40:56.259 --> 40:58.719
You last saw Caspian
at the Shuddering Woods,

40:58.803 --> 41:01.722
and the quickest way there
is to cross at the river Rush.

41:01.806 --> 41:05.184
But unless I'm mistaken,
there's no crossing in these parts.

41:05.268 --> 41:08.312
That explains it, then.
You're mistaken.

41:31.085 --> 41:35.007
You see, over time, water erodes
the earth's soil, carving deeper...

41:35.090 --> 41:36.758
Oh, shut up.

41:36.842 --> 41:40.053
- Is there a way down?
- Yeah, falling.

41:40.137 --> 41:43.056
Well, we weren't lost.

41:43.140 --> 41:46.310
There's a ford near Beruna.
How do you feel about swimming?

41:46.393 --> 41:48.437
I'd rather that than walking.

41:49.688 --> 41:51.148
Aslan?

41:51.690 --> 41:54.568
It's Aslan!
It's Aslan over there!

41:55.277 --> 41:57.112
Don't you see? He's right...

42:01.283 --> 42:02.493
...there.

42:03.327 --> 42:05.537
Do you see him now?

42:06.789 --> 42:08.624
I'm not crazy.

42:08.707 --> 42:11.460
He was there.
He wanted us to follow him.

42:14.588 --> 42:17.508
I'm sure there are any number
of lions in this wood.

42:17.591 --> 42:20.677
- Just like that bear.
- I think I know Aslan when I see him.

42:21.970 --> 42:24.556
Look, I'm not about
to jump off a cliff

42:24.640 --> 42:26.767
after someone who doesn't exist.

42:26.850 --> 42:29.270
The last time I didn't believe Lucy

42:29.354 --> 42:31.773
I ended up looking pretty stupid.

42:37.695 --> 42:39.489
Why wouldn't I have seen him?

42:39.572 --> 42:41.950
Maybe you weren't looking.

42:43.952 --> 42:45.245
I'm sorry, Lu.

43:11.896 --> 43:13.523
Kill him!

43:13.606 --> 43:15.316
- Telmarine!
- Liar!

43:16.568 --> 43:17.652
Murderer!

43:17.735 --> 43:20.989
All this horn proves is they've stolen
yet another thing from us!

43:21.072 --> 43:23.951
- I didn't steal anything.
- Didn't steal anything?

43:24.034 --> 43:26.871
Shall we list the things
the Telmarines have taken?

43:26.954 --> 43:28.539
- Our homes!
- Our land!

43:28.622 --> 43:30.958
- Our freedom!
- Our lives!

43:31.041 --> 43:32.126
You stole Narnia!

43:32.209 --> 43:35.546
You would hold me accountable
for all the crimes of my people?

43:35.629 --> 43:37.047
Accountable...

43:37.965 --> 43:39.467
...and punishable.

43:40.634 --> 43:42.970
That is rich coming from you, dwarf.

43:43.053 --> 43:47.099
Have you forgotten it was your people
who fought alongside the White Witch?

43:47.183 --> 43:50.978
And I'd gladly do it again,
if it would rid us of these barbarians.

43:51.061 --> 43:54.607
Then it's lucky that it is not
in your power to bring her back.

43:55.649 --> 43:59.153
Or are you suggesting that we ask
this boy to go against Aslan now?

44:02.490 --> 44:06.118
Some of you may have forgotten,
but we badgers remember well,

44:06.202 --> 44:10.873
that Narnia was never right
except when a Son of Adam was king.

44:10.956 --> 44:13.876
He's a Telmarine!
Why would we want him as our king?

44:13.959 --> 44:15.836
Because I can help you.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.673
- It's a trick!
- At least hear him out!

44:18.757 --> 44:22.344
Beyond these woods, I'm a prince.

44:23.220 --> 44:26.014
The Telmarine throne
is rightfully mine!

44:26.097 --> 44:30.393
Help me claim it,
and I can bring peace between us.

44:31.728 --> 44:35.649
It is true. The time is ripe.

44:36.775 --> 44:39.069
I watch the skies,

44:39.152 --> 44:43.740
for it is mine to watch
as it is yours to remember, badger.

44:45.367 --> 44:50.330
Tarva, the lord of victory,
and Alambil, the lady of peace,

44:50.413 --> 44:53.458
have come together
in the high heavens.

44:54.709 --> 44:59.172
And now here,
a Son of Adam has come forth...

45:00.549 --> 45:03.510
...to offer us back our freedom.

45:03.593 --> 45:06.721
Is this possible? Do you really
think there could be peace?

45:06.805 --> 45:09.474
Do you? I mean, really?

45:09.558 --> 45:14.647
Two days ago, I didn't believe
in the existence of talking animals...

45:14.730 --> 45:17.483
...or dwarves... or centaurs.

45:19.068 --> 45:22.280
Yet here you are
in strength and numbers

45:22.363 --> 45:25.408
that we Telmarines
could never have imagined.

45:25.491 --> 45:30.872
Whether this horn is magic or not,
it brought us together.

45:31.747 --> 45:33.666
And together,

45:33.749 --> 45:36.419
we have a chance
to take back what is ours.

45:37.670 --> 45:43.009
If you will lead us,
then my sons and I...

45:44.177 --> 45:46.888
...offer you our swords.

45:57.190 --> 46:00.610
And we offer you our lives,
unreservedly.

46:02.278 --> 46:06.032
Miraz's army will not
be far behind us, sire.

46:06.115 --> 46:11.163
If we are to be ready for them, we need
to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.

46:14.333 --> 46:17.461
I'm sure they will be here soon.

46:28.472 --> 46:30.974
These ones!
And these ones!

46:34.144 --> 46:36.271
Timber!

46:36.939 --> 46:39.566
- Get back!
- Watch your back!

46:40.943 --> 46:42.486
Look out!

46:44.363 --> 46:46.865
- Steady, steady!
- Timber!

47:04.300 --> 47:07.387
Perhaps this wasn't the best way
to come after all.

47:36.082 --> 47:38.751
So where exactly
do you think you saw Aslan?

47:41.337 --> 47:44.466
I wish you'd all stop trying
to sound like grown-ups.

47:44.549 --> 47:47.802
I don't think I saw him,
I did see him.

47:48.511 --> 47:50.680
I am a grown-up.

47:51.473 --> 47:53.683
It was right over...

47:53.766 --> 47:55.477
Lucy!

48:00.608 --> 48:01.859
...here.

48:52.202 --> 48:54.204
Lucy, are you awake?

49:00.127 --> 49:02.295
Why do you think I didn't see Aslan?

49:07.425 --> 49:09.427
You believe me?

49:09.511 --> 49:12.472
Well, we got across the gorge.

49:15.183 --> 49:17.185
I don't know.

49:19.104 --> 49:21.648
Maybe you didn't really want to.

49:25.443 --> 49:28.321
You always knew we'd be
coming back here, didn't you?

49:28.905 --> 49:30.657
I hoped so.

49:35.579 --> 49:39.583
I finally just got used
to the idea of being in England.

49:39.666 --> 49:42.085
But you're happy
to be here, aren't you?

49:44.004 --> 49:46.132
While it lasts.

51:51.301 --> 51:53.052
Lucy.

51:56.264 --> 51:58.141
Lucy.

52:06.733 --> 52:08.818
Aslan!

52:18.953 --> 52:21.623
I've missed you so much!

52:25.251 --> 52:27.796
- You've grown.
- Every year you grow...

52:27.879 --> 52:29.882
...so shall I.

52:31.759 --> 52:36.096
Where have you been?
Why haven't you come to help us?

52:37.264 --> 52:40.309
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

52:48.275 --> 52:50.152
Susan! Wake up!

52:52.571 --> 52:56.158
Certainly, Lu.
Whatever you like.

53:18.764 --> 53:20.516
Wake up.

53:36.825 --> 53:38.285
Aslan?

54:17.115 --> 54:18.576
No, stop!

54:40.723 --> 54:42.683
Prince Caspian?

54:42.767 --> 54:45.394
Yes? And who are you?

54:45.478 --> 54:47.480
Peter!

54:57.365 --> 55:00.535
- High King Peter.
- I believe you called.

55:00.618 --> 55:04.080
Well, yes, but...
I thought you'd be older.

55:04.997 --> 55:07.708
If you like, we could
come back in a few years...

55:08.084 --> 55:11.754
No. No, that's all right.
You're just...

55:11.838 --> 55:14.758
You're not exactly what I expected.

55:17.928 --> 55:19.096
Neither are you.

55:20.472 --> 55:23.350
A common enemy unites
even the oldest of foes.

55:23.433 --> 55:27.688
We have anxiously awaited
your return, my liege.

55:27.771 --> 55:30.065
Our hearts and swords
are at your service.

55:30.149 --> 55:31.900
Oh, my gosh, he is so cute.

55:31.984 --> 55:35.404
- Who said that?
- Sorry.

55:36.947 --> 55:40.325
Your Majesty, with the greatest respect,

55:40.409 --> 55:43.871
I do believe 'courageous,'
'courteous,' or 'chivalrous'

55:43.954 --> 55:46.165
might more befit a knight of Narnia.

55:46.248 --> 55:49.418
Well, at least we know some of you
can handle a blade.

55:49.501 --> 55:52.463
Yes, indeed. And I have
recently put it to good use,

55:52.546 --> 55:54.631
securing weapons for your army, sire.

55:54.715 --> 55:58.969
Good. Because we're going
to need every sword we can get.

55:59.052 --> 56:02.556
Well, then, you will probably
be wanting yours back.

56:22.118 --> 56:25.121
How much did they take?

56:25.205 --> 56:27.624
Enough weapons and armour
for two regiments.

56:27.707 --> 56:31.127
But... there's more.

56:33.755 --> 56:37.509
'You were right to fear the woods.'

56:37.592 --> 56:42.263
- 'X'?
- Caspian. The tenth.

56:42.347 --> 56:46.059
I apologise, my lord.
The blame is mine.

56:46.142 --> 56:47.685
I know.

56:49.437 --> 56:50.855
Tell me, general...

56:52.440 --> 56:54.275
...how many men did you lose?

56:54.901 --> 56:57.987
- None, my lord.
- None?

56:58.071 --> 57:03.285
They came like ghosts,
in the dead of night. We never saw them.

57:05.120 --> 57:07.957
Then how do you explain your injuries?

57:17.091 --> 57:19.343
I asked...

57:19.426 --> 57:21.637
...how many men were killed

57:21.720 --> 57:25.474
during this bloody Narnian attack?

57:26.976 --> 57:31.272
Of which you were a fortunate survivor.

57:33.732 --> 57:35.734
General...

57:36.694 --> 57:38.445
...how many?

57:53.127 --> 57:55.045
Three.

58:03.305 --> 58:06.099
I apologise, Lord Sopespian.

58:07.100 --> 58:12.063
Caspian is not a victim
of this savage uprising.

58:12.147 --> 58:13.690
He is the instigator.

58:18.820 --> 58:21.990
It seems Narnia is in need
of a new king.

58:31.416 --> 58:33.502
Well, it's good you have troops,

58:33.585 --> 58:37.297
but we need some fortifications.
Somewhere to train.

58:40.842 --> 58:44.471
So? What are they like?

58:44.554 --> 58:49.768
Malcontents, complainers,
stubborn as mules in the morning.

58:49.851 --> 58:51.771
So you like them, then.

58:53.064 --> 58:54.899
Well enough.

01:00:13.228 --> 01:00:18.066
It may not be what you are used to,
but it is defensible.

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:21.069
Peter. You may want to see this.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.587
It's us.

01:00:40.924 --> 01:00:43.009
What is this place?

01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:46.054
You don't know?

01:02:22.943 --> 01:02:24.862
He must know what he's doing.

01:02:31.912 --> 01:02:33.872
I think it's up to us now.

01:03:06.905 --> 01:03:09.324
It's only a matter of time.

01:03:09.407 --> 01:03:13.328
Miraz's men and war machines
are on their way.

01:03:14.204 --> 01:03:17.249
That means those same men
aren't protecting his castle.

01:03:17.332 --> 01:03:19.042
What do you propose we do,
Your Majesty?

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:21.753
- We need to get ready for it.
- To start planning for...

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.096
Our only hope is to strike them
before they strike us.

01:03:30.179 --> 01:03:31.973
Crazy. No one has taken that castle.

01:03:32.056 --> 01:03:35.560
- There's always a first time.
- We'll have the element of surprise.

01:03:35.643 --> 01:03:38.521
- But we have the advantage here!
- If we dig in,

01:03:38.604 --> 01:03:41.524
we could probably
hold them off indefinitely.

01:03:43.317 --> 01:03:46.237
I, for one, feel safer underground.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.448
Look. I appreciate
what you've done here,

01:03:49.532 --> 01:03:52.076
but this isn't a fortress. It's a tomb.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.703
Yes. And if they're smart,

01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:56.664
the Telmarines will just wait
and starve us out.

01:03:56.747 --> 01:04:00.585
- We could collect nuts!
- Yes! And throw them at the Telmarines.

01:04:00.668 --> 01:04:02.753
Shut up!

01:04:02.837 --> 01:04:04.839
I think you know where I stand, sire.

01:04:09.594 --> 01:04:13.514
If I get your troops in,
can you handle the guards?

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:21.106
Or die trying, my liege.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:25.068
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Sorry?

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:29.781
You're all acting like
there's only two options.

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:32.367
Dying here, or dying there.

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:36.246
- I'm not sure you've been listening.
- No, you're not listening.

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:39.625
Or have you forgotten who really
defeated the White Witch, Peter?

01:04:42.085 --> 01:04:44.880
I think we've waited
for Aslan long enough.

01:08:39.702 --> 01:08:40.745
Professor?

01:09:04.685 --> 01:09:07.523
- I have to find him.
- You don't have time.

01:09:07.606 --> 01:09:11.484
- You need to get the gate open.
- You wouldn't be here without him.

01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:13.028
And neither would I.

01:09:16.156 --> 01:09:18.908
You and I can deal with Miraz.

01:09:18.992 --> 01:09:21.161
And I can still get
to the gate in time.

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:48.814
Yes, I'm a mouse.

01:10:10.044 --> 01:10:12.797
We were expecting someone,
you know, taller.

01:10:12.881 --> 01:10:16.509
- You're one to talk.
- Is that supposed to be irony?

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.020
Five more minutes?

01:10:28.313 --> 01:10:30.857
What are you doing here?

01:10:32.442 --> 01:10:36.237
I didn't help you escape
just so you could break back in.

01:10:37.155 --> 01:10:38.781
You have to get out

01:10:38.865 --> 01:10:41.327
before Miraz learns you're here.

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:43.245
He's going to learn soon enough.

01:10:44.246 --> 01:10:45.873
We are giving him your cell.

01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:51.212
Don't underestimate Miraz
as your father did.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.882
What are you talking about?

01:10:56.133 --> 01:10:58.010
I'm sorry.

01:11:16.278 --> 01:11:19.698
Thank goodness you're safe.

01:11:19.782 --> 01:11:21.116
Get up.

01:11:26.497 --> 01:11:28.249
- Caspian?
- Stay where you are.

01:11:28.332 --> 01:11:31.877
- What are you doing?
- I should think it's obvious, dear.

01:11:31.961 --> 01:11:35.924
You know, some families might
consider this inappropriate behaviour.

01:11:36.007 --> 01:11:38.218
That doesn't seem to have stopped you!

01:11:38.301 --> 01:11:40.470
But you are not like me, are you?

01:11:42.305 --> 01:11:46.143
It's sad. The first time
you've shown any backbone...

01:11:46.226 --> 01:11:47.644
...and it's such a waste.

01:11:50.856 --> 01:11:53.692
Put the sword down, Caspian.

01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:58.697
- I don't want to do this.
- We don't want you to either.

01:12:03.785 --> 01:12:05.412
This used to be a private room.

01:12:05.495 --> 01:12:08.748
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be in the gatehouse!

01:12:08.832 --> 01:12:10.000
No!

01:12:11.001 --> 01:12:13.837
Tonight for once, I want the truth.

01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:17.340
Did you kill my father?

01:12:22.053 --> 01:12:23.805
Now we get to it.

01:12:24.681 --> 01:12:26.975
You said your brother died in his sleep.

01:12:27.058 --> 01:12:29.020
That was more or less true.

01:12:29.103 --> 01:12:32.231
Caspian, this won't
make things any better.

01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:35.359
We Telmarines would have
nothing had we not taken it.

01:12:35.443 --> 01:12:37.653
Your father knew that
as well as anyone.

01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:40.114
How could you?

01:12:40.198 --> 01:12:42.700
For the same reason
you will pull that trigger.

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:45.870
- For our son.
- Stop!

01:12:45.953 --> 01:12:48.748
- Stay right there.
- You need to make a choice, dear.

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:51.125
Do you want our child to be king?

01:12:51.209 --> 01:12:54.212
Or do you want him
to be like Caspian here?

01:12:57.381 --> 01:12:59.926
- Fatherless!
- No!

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:01.969
Caspian!

01:13:32.459 --> 01:13:34.294
What's that supposed to mean?

01:13:36.296 --> 01:13:39.842
- We're under attack!
- Sound the alarm!

01:13:39.925 --> 01:13:42.845
Men! Grab your bows!

01:13:47.307 --> 01:13:50.435
- Peter!
- Our troops are just outside! Come on!

01:13:55.232 --> 01:13:56.567
Now, Ed! Now!

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.153
- Signal the troops!
- I'm a bit busy, Pete!

01:14:21.843 --> 01:14:25.096
Peter! It's too late.
We have to call it off while we can.

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.973
No, I can still do this!

01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:30.059
Help me!

01:14:47.619 --> 01:14:51.164
Exactly who are you
doing this for, Peter?

01:14:56.294 --> 01:14:57.545
Come on!

01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:09.057
Charge!

01:15:14.605 --> 01:15:16.524
We're under attack!

01:15:22.446 --> 01:15:24.740
Attack! Attack!

01:15:42.758 --> 01:15:44.510
For Narnia!

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:26.303
Archers!

01:16:28.096 --> 01:16:29.556
Pick a target!

01:16:32.058 --> 01:16:33.143
Take aim!

01:16:41.693 --> 01:16:42.736
Ed!

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:46.759
Get that gate closed.

01:18:40.439 --> 01:18:41.773
Fall back!

01:18:48.405 --> 01:18:50.073
We need to retreat! Now!

01:18:52.577 --> 01:18:54.787
Go! Get her out of here!

01:18:55.538 --> 01:18:58.166
Back to the gate! Go!

01:19:03.796 --> 01:19:07.300
- Caspian!
- I'll find him!

01:19:07.383 --> 01:19:11.471
Go! Get out! Go!
Get out! Retreat!

01:19:16.392 --> 01:19:18.144
Follow me!

01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:54.181
Give the order.

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.310
My men are still down there.

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:01.647
Draw back!
Get out! Retreat!

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:06.652
Now!

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.199
Fire!

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:37.892
Run for your life!
Save yourself!

01:20:52.157 --> 01:20:54.034
Peter! The bridge!

01:21:10.425 --> 01:21:11.843
Leave us! Go, brothers!

01:21:12.928 --> 01:21:15.972
In the name of Aslan!

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.117
What happened?

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.910
Ask him.

01:22:18.536 --> 01:22:21.038
- Peter.
- Me?

01:22:21.122 --> 01:22:23.749
You could've called it off.
There was still time.

01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:25.459
No, there wasn't, thanks to you.

01:22:25.543 --> 01:22:28.379
If you kept to the plan,
those soldiers might be alive.

01:22:28.462 --> 01:22:31.216
If you'd stayed here like I suggested,
they definitely would be!

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:35.262
- You called us, remember?
- My first mistake.

01:22:35.345 --> 01:22:38.724
No. Your first mistake was thinking
you could lead these people.

01:22:41.894 --> 01:22:45.355
I am not the one who abandoned Narnia.

01:22:45.439 --> 01:22:49.860
You invaded Narnia. You have no more
right to lead it than Miraz does.

01:22:49.943 --> 01:22:51.695
You, him, your father...

01:22:52.529 --> 01:22:55.073
Narnia's better off
without the lot of you.

01:22:55.949 --> 01:22:57.326
Stop it!

01:23:38.535 --> 01:23:41.120
What are you all standing around for?

01:23:43.456 --> 01:23:45.959
Telmarines will be here soon enough.

01:23:48.795 --> 01:23:52.382
Thank you...
my dear little friend.

01:23:58.096 --> 01:24:02.684
- Well done, lads.
- Move it faster, mate. Too slow!

01:24:12.485 --> 01:24:15.071
Beruna pledges its troops.

01:24:15.155 --> 01:24:19.034
Galma pledges its troops.

01:24:19.118 --> 01:24:21.996
Tashbaan pledges its troops.

01:24:22.079 --> 01:24:25.749
Ettinsmoor pledges its troops.

01:24:55.404 --> 01:24:59.450
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

01:25:24.976 --> 01:25:27.979
Are you so glad
of that magic horn now, boy?

01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:33.360
Your kings and queens have failed us.

01:25:33.443 --> 01:25:38.782
Your army's half dead. And those
that aren't will be soon enough.

01:25:40.242 --> 01:25:42.828
What do you want?
Congratulations?

01:25:44.287 --> 01:25:48.041
You want your uncle's blood.
So do we.

01:25:49.292 --> 01:25:53.129
You want his throne?
We can get it for you.

01:26:10.439 --> 01:26:14.777
You tried one ancient power.
It failed.

01:26:14.861 --> 01:26:18.030
But there is a power greater still.

01:26:18.906 --> 01:26:22.869
One that kept even Aslan at bay
for near a hundred years.

01:26:36.799 --> 01:26:39.093
Who's there?

01:26:40.178 --> 01:26:41.762
I am hunger.

01:26:44.807 --> 01:26:46.642
I am thirst.

01:26:48.186 --> 01:26:50.980
I can fast a hundred years...

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:53.691
...and not die.

01:26:54.567 --> 01:26:57.361
I can lie a hundred nights
on the ice...

01:26:58.029 --> 01:26:59.906
...and not freeze.

01:27:00.656 --> 01:27:05.871
I can drink a river of blood
and not burst.

01:27:06.705 --> 01:27:10.918
Show me... your enemies!

01:27:12.002 --> 01:27:16.173
What you hate, so will we.

01:27:16.256 --> 01:27:19.009
No one hates better than us.

01:27:22.721 --> 01:27:27.184
And you can...
guarantee Miraz's death?

01:27:28.227 --> 01:27:30.103
And more.

01:27:42.324 --> 01:27:44.827
Let the circle be drawn.

01:28:55.941 --> 01:28:57.151
Wait.

01:29:00.863 --> 01:29:02.490
This isn't what I wanted.

01:29:05.159 --> 01:29:10.206
One drop of Adam's blood
and you free me.

01:29:10.289 --> 01:29:12.541
Then I am yours, my king.

01:29:13.334 --> 01:29:14.752
No!

01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:38.025
Stop!

01:30:19.276 --> 01:30:21.945
Come on! Come.

01:30:23.029 --> 01:30:24.531
Get away from him!

01:30:29.995 --> 01:30:31.413
Peter, dear.

01:30:32.164 --> 01:30:33.790
I've missed you.

01:30:36.168 --> 01:30:37.460
Come.

01:30:38.044 --> 01:30:39.839
Just one drop.

01:30:42.091 --> 01:30:44.760
You know you can't do this alone.

01:31:15.708 --> 01:31:18.628
I know. You had it sorted.

01:32:06.552 --> 01:32:09.555
Why did you never tell me
about my father?

01:32:12.224 --> 01:32:17.145
My mother was a Black Dwarf
from the Northern Mountains.

01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:21.900
I risked my life all these years

01:32:21.984 --> 01:32:25.612
so that one day...

01:32:25.696 --> 01:32:29.742
...you might be a better king
than those before you.

01:32:32.412 --> 01:32:34.747
Then I have failed you.

01:32:38.334 --> 01:32:43.131
Everything I told you,
everything I didn't,

01:32:43.214 --> 01:32:47.135
it was only because I believe in you.

01:32:47.218 --> 01:32:53.183
You have a chance to become the most
noble contradiction in history.

01:32:56.436 --> 01:32:59.814
The Telmarine who saved Narnia.

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:26.467
You're lucky, you know.

01:33:28.344 --> 01:33:30.304
What do you mean?

01:33:31.889 --> 01:33:33.724
To have seen him.

01:33:35.935 --> 01:33:40.147
I wish he'd just given me
some sort of proof.

01:33:42.441 --> 01:33:46.195
Maybe we're the ones who need
to prove ourselves to him.

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:54.078
Pete. You'd better come quickly.

01:34:57.058 --> 01:35:00.729
Cakes and kettledrums.
That's your next big plan?

01:35:01.563 --> 01:35:06.318
Sending a little girl into the darkest
parts of the forest? Alone!

01:35:06.401 --> 01:35:10.322
- It's our only chance.
- And she won't be alone.

01:35:12.408 --> 01:35:16.204
Haven't enough of us died already?

01:35:16.287 --> 01:35:20.708
Nikabrik was my friend too.
But he lost hope.

01:35:21.459 --> 01:35:24.462
Queen Lucy hasn't.
And neither have I.

01:35:25.588 --> 01:35:26.964
For Aslan.

01:35:27.632 --> 01:35:29.133
For Aslan!

01:35:34.055 --> 01:35:37.642
- Then I'm going with you.
- No. We need you here.

01:35:37.725 --> 01:35:40.686
We have to hold them off
until Lucy and Susan get back.

01:35:41.729 --> 01:35:43.272
If I may...

01:35:47.985 --> 01:35:52.114
Miraz may be a tyrant
and a murderer...

01:35:53.908 --> 01:35:58.663
...but as king, he is
subject to the traditions...

01:35:58.746 --> 01:36:02.583
...and expectations of his people.

01:36:02.667 --> 01:36:06.420
There is one in particular
that may buy us some time.

01:36:14.763 --> 01:36:17.391
Perhaps they intend to surrender.

01:36:17.474 --> 01:36:18.976
No.

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.939
They are much too noble for that.

01:36:26.275 --> 01:36:30.737
'I, Peter, by the gift of Aslan,
by election and by conquest,

01:36:30.821 --> 01:36:35.951
High King of Narnia, Lord of Cair
Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands,

01:36:36.034 --> 01:36:39.163
in order to prevent
the abominable effusion of blood,

01:36:39.246 --> 01:36:43.834
do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to
single combat upon the field of battle.

01:36:43.917 --> 01:36:49.089
The fight shall be to the death.
The reward shall be total surrender.'

01:36:52.092 --> 01:36:54.428
- Tell me, Prince Edmund...
- King.

01:36:55.512 --> 01:36:59.683
- Pardon me?
- It's King Edmund, actually.

01:36:59.766 --> 01:37:02.437
Just 'King,' though.
Peter's the high king.

01:37:03.396 --> 01:37:05.356
I know, it's confusing.

01:37:07.984 --> 01:37:10.820
Why would we risk such a proposal

01:37:10.904 --> 01:37:14.282
when our armies could
wipe you out by nightfall?

01:37:15.325 --> 01:37:18.286
Haven't you already
underestimated our numbers?

01:37:18.953 --> 01:37:24.000
I mean, only a week ago
Narnians were extinct.

01:37:24.083 --> 01:37:26.252
And so you will be again.

01:37:26.336 --> 01:37:28.630
Well, then you should have
little to fear.

01:37:30.548 --> 01:37:32.592
This is not a question of bravery.

01:37:32.675 --> 01:37:36.387
So you're bravely refusing
to fight a swordsman half your age?

01:37:38.431 --> 01:37:41.559
I didn't say I refused.

01:37:41.643 --> 01:37:44.145
You shall have our support,
Your Majesty.

01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:45.980
Whatever your decision.

01:37:46.064 --> 01:37:51.069
Sire, our military advantage alone
provides the perfect excuse to avoid

01:37:51.152 --> 01:37:54.155
- what might otherwise be...
- I'm not avoiding anything!

01:37:55.825 --> 01:37:57.409
I was merely pointing out

01:37:57.493 --> 01:38:00.329
that my lord is well
within his rights to refuse.

01:38:00.412 --> 01:38:02.915
His Majesty would never refuse.

01:38:03.999 --> 01:38:06.752
He relishes the chance
to show the people

01:38:06.836 --> 01:38:09.088
the courage of their new king.

01:38:14.301 --> 01:38:15.386
You.

01:38:19.306 --> 01:38:23.894
You should hope your brother's sword
is sharper than his pen.

01:38:28.607 --> 01:38:33.028
Destrier has always served me well.
You are in good hands.

01:38:33.112 --> 01:38:34.738
Or hooves.

01:38:40.411 --> 01:38:43.664
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:38:47.793 --> 01:38:49.295
Look.

01:38:51.423 --> 01:38:53.758
Maybe it is time you had this back.

01:38:56.303 --> 01:39:00.765
Why don't you hold on to it.
You might need to call me again.

01:39:07.814 --> 01:39:11.943
- You might need to call me again?
- Oh, shut up.

01:39:58.074 --> 01:40:01.035
If it should appear
to be going poorly...

01:40:05.873 --> 01:40:07.959
Understood, Your Majesty.

01:40:21.472 --> 01:40:25.643
I hope you won't be too disappointed
when I survive.

01:40:56.175 --> 01:40:58.760
There is still time to surrender.

01:41:01.096 --> 01:41:03.015
Well, feel free.

01:41:03.098 --> 01:41:05.559
How many more must die for the throne?

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.145
Just one.

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:36.257
- Ride!
- They've seen us!

01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:53.399
- Take the reins.
- What are you doing?

01:41:53.483 --> 01:41:58.196
I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if
you'll be going alone after all.

01:43:15.733 --> 01:43:17.735
Are you sure you don't need that horn?

01:44:33.938 --> 01:44:37.525
Does His Highness need a respite?

01:44:37.608 --> 01:44:39.277
Five minutes?

01:44:40.528 --> 01:44:41.737
Three!

01:45:01.257 --> 01:45:02.967
Lucy?

01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:06.387
She got through... with a little help.

01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:09.432
- Thanks.
- Well, you were busy.

01:45:09.515 --> 01:45:14.188
I assume you won't let things
get that close again!

01:45:19.401 --> 01:45:22.446
You better get up there.
Just in case.

01:45:22.529 --> 01:45:24.990
I don't expect the Telmarines
will keep their word.

01:45:29.828 --> 01:45:32.247
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:45:32.331 --> 01:45:33.916
Be careful.

01:45:35.292 --> 01:45:36.752
Keep smiling.

01:45:49.389 --> 01:45:51.433
How does he look to you?

01:45:51.934 --> 01:45:53.435
Young.

01:45:56.146 --> 01:46:00.484
But His Majesty's doing
extremely well... for his age.

01:46:08.868 --> 01:46:10.370
I think it's dislocated.

01:46:15.041 --> 01:46:18.419
What do you think happens
back home if you die here?

01:46:22.507 --> 01:46:25.552
You know you've always been there,
and I never really...

01:46:28.721 --> 01:46:29.973
Save it for later.

01:48:19.209 --> 01:48:20.669
Respite!

01:48:24.256 --> 01:48:25.674
Respite.

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:28.844
Now's not the time for chivalry, Peter!

01:48:29.886 --> 01:48:31.388
Show no mercy!

01:48:51.409 --> 01:48:53.953
Look out!

01:49:19.896 --> 01:49:22.315
What's the matter, boy?

01:49:23.441 --> 01:49:25.610
Too cowardly to take a life?

01:49:29.655 --> 01:49:31.741
It's not mine to take.

01:50:14.076 --> 01:50:16.620
Perhaps I was wrong.

01:50:16.703 --> 01:50:22.209
Maybe you do have the makings
of a Telmarine king after all.

01:50:35.764 --> 01:50:37.850
Not one like you.

01:50:47.110 --> 01:50:50.071
Keep your life.

01:50:50.154 --> 01:50:53.616
But I am giving the Narnians
back their kingdom.

01:51:24.731 --> 01:51:25.940
My king.

01:51:29.235 --> 01:51:33.531
I'll deal with you when this is over.

01:51:34.408 --> 01:51:37.411
It is over.

01:51:51.926 --> 01:51:56.180
Treachery! They shot him!

01:51:56.263 --> 01:51:58.682
They murdered our king!

01:51:59.517 --> 01:52:01.519
Be ready!

01:52:03.312 --> 01:52:04.480
Peter!

01:52:11.070 --> 01:52:12.821
Go!

01:52:20.037 --> 01:52:23.249
To arms, Telmar!

01:52:23.332 --> 01:52:25.084
To arms!

01:52:29.214 --> 01:52:30.257
Loose!

01:52:55.782 --> 01:52:57.284
Cavalry!

01:52:59.202 --> 01:53:03.039
Attack!

01:53:19.514 --> 01:53:21.850
Archers to the ready!

01:53:45.583 --> 01:53:47.335
Narnians!

01:53:47.418 --> 01:53:50.713
Charge!

01:54:11.984 --> 01:54:15.154
One, two...

01:54:15.238 --> 01:54:17.699
Three, four...

01:54:17.783 --> 01:54:20.619
Five, six...

01:54:22.996 --> 01:54:24.414
Take your aim!

01:54:26.166 --> 01:54:27.584
Stay with them!

01:54:29.837 --> 01:54:33.006
Eight, nine...

01:54:33.090 --> 01:54:35.133
Get ready!

01:54:36.718 --> 01:54:38.387
Now!

01:55:00.576 --> 01:55:03.453
Stop! Back! Back!

01:55:05.038 --> 01:55:07.708
Hold it now! Hold it!

01:55:10.878 --> 01:55:11.920
Now!

01:55:27.645 --> 01:55:30.523
Charge!

01:55:43.203 --> 01:55:44.495
Charge!

01:56:11.649 --> 01:56:13.317
You're a mouse.

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:15.778
You people have no imagination.

01:56:46.392 --> 01:56:48.227
Loose! Loose!

01:56:56.277 --> 01:56:57.820
Lucy?

01:57:06.705 --> 01:57:08.290
Back to the How!

01:57:13.545 --> 01:57:15.046
Cut off their escape!

01:57:15.130 --> 01:57:16.464
Loose!

01:57:18.258 --> 01:57:20.218
Loose!

01:57:27.392 --> 01:57:30.812
Brace yourselves!

01:57:32.063 --> 01:57:33.648
Back to the How!

01:58:21.489 --> 01:58:23.115
Crush them all.

01:59:33.979 --> 01:59:35.063
Aslan!

01:59:44.573 --> 01:59:47.911
I knew it was you.
The whole time, I knew it.

01:59:47.994 --> 01:59:50.246
But the others didn't believe me.

01:59:50.330 --> 01:59:52.790
And why would that stop you
from coming to me?

01:59:55.627 --> 01:59:58.463
I'm sorry. I was too scared
to come alone.

02:00:00.381 --> 02:00:02.425
Why wouldn't you show yourself?

02:00:02.509 --> 02:00:05.762
Why couldn't you come roaring in
and save us like last time?

02:00:05.845 --> 02:00:09.432
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

02:00:14.437 --> 02:00:19.567
If I'd have come earlier, would everyone
who died... could I have stopped that?

02:00:21.611 --> 02:00:24.697
We can never know
what would have happened, Lucy.

02:00:24.781 --> 02:00:29.035
But what will happen
is another matter entirely.

02:00:29.118 --> 02:00:31.538
- You mean you'll help?
- Of course.

02:00:31.621 --> 02:00:35.291
- As will you.
- Oh, I wish I was braver.

02:00:35.375 --> 02:00:38.253
If you were any braver,
you'd be a lioness.

02:00:38.336 --> 02:00:43.342
Now, I think your friends
have slept long enough, don't you?

02:01:15.332 --> 02:01:17.418
Come on!

02:02:21.149 --> 02:02:22.526
Lucy.

02:02:48.845 --> 02:02:51.180
For Aslan!

02:02:56.602 --> 02:02:59.438
We can defeat them
if we draw them to the river.

02:02:59.522 --> 02:03:02.525
We must regroup. To Beruna!

02:03:02.608 --> 02:03:04.652
To the bridge!

02:04:02.586 --> 02:04:04.338
Charge!

02:04:32.408 --> 02:04:35.286
What is happening?

02:04:35.370 --> 02:04:38.331
- The river!
- Retreat!

02:04:38.414 --> 02:04:40.416
Back! Back!

02:05:42.521 --> 02:05:44.148
Come on.

02:06:12.677 --> 02:06:15.138
Assemble on that bank!

02:06:17.432 --> 02:06:19.684
You will not be harmed!

02:06:21.394 --> 02:06:23.730
Surrender your weapons!

02:06:23.772 --> 02:06:26.107
Take off the armour!

02:06:42.791 --> 02:06:46.419
Rise, kings and queens of Narnia.

02:06:50.006 --> 02:06:51.341
All of you.

02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:58.849
I do not think I am ready.

02:06:58.932 --> 02:07:02.228
It's for that very reason
I know you are.

02:07:50.568 --> 02:07:53.279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

02:07:53.362 --> 02:07:55.531
Thank you.

02:07:57.618 --> 02:08:02.581
Hail, Aslan!
It is a great honour to be in...

02:08:06.585 --> 02:08:09.254
I'm completely out of countenance.

02:08:09.338 --> 02:08:13.217
I must crave your indulgence
for appearing in this unseemly fashion.

02:08:15.052 --> 02:08:17.137
Perhaps a drop more?

02:08:17.221 --> 02:08:20.307
- I don't think it does that.
- You could have a go.

02:08:21.642 --> 02:08:23.352
It becomes you well, small one.

02:08:23.435 --> 02:08:26.230
All the same, great king,

02:08:26.313 --> 02:08:31.818
I regret that I must withdraw, for a
tail is the honour and glory of a mouse.

02:08:31.902 --> 02:08:35.364
Perhaps you think too much
of your honour, friend.

02:08:35.447 --> 02:08:40.327
Well, it's not just the honour.
It's also great for balance.

02:08:40.410 --> 02:08:43.914
And climbing.
And grabbing things.

02:08:43.997 --> 02:08:47.376
May it please Your High Majesty,
we will not bear the shame

02:08:47.459 --> 02:08:50.463
of wearing an honour
denied to our chief.

02:08:50.547 --> 02:08:53.466
Not for the sake of your dignity,

02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:56.302
but for the love of your people.

02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:06.813
Look! Thank you, my liege.
I will treasure it always.

02:09:06.896 --> 02:09:11.609
From this day forward it will serve
as a great reminder of my huge humility.

02:09:13.653 --> 02:09:17.740
Now, where is this dear little friend
you've told me so much about?

02:09:37.886 --> 02:09:39.971
Do you see him now?

02:10:44.913 --> 02:10:47.832
Because you have snuck in...

02:10:47.916 --> 02:10:51.002
I'm sorry, but their future
in that world shall be good.

02:10:51.962 --> 02:10:54.047
Your Majesty?

02:11:03.723 --> 02:11:07.227
We are ready.
Everyone has assembled.

02:11:16.528 --> 02:11:20.949
Narnia belongs to the Narnians,
just as it does to man.

02:11:21.032 --> 02:11:25.287
Any Telmarines who want to stay
and live in peace are welcome to.

02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:27.747
But for any of you who wish,

02:11:27.831 --> 02:11:31.418
Aslan will return you
to the home of our forefathers.

02:11:31.501 --> 02:11:34.547
It's been generations
since we left Telmar.

02:11:34.630 --> 02:11:36.966
We're not referring to Telmar.

02:11:37.049 --> 02:11:39.760
Your ancestors were seafaring brigands.

02:11:39.844 --> 02:11:42.513
Pirates run aground on an island.

02:11:42.597 --> 02:11:47.727
There they found a cave, a rare chasm
that brought them here from their world.

02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:50.563
The same world as our kings and queens.

02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:55.526
It is to that island I can return you.

02:11:55.610 --> 02:11:59.655
It is a good place for any
who wish to make a new start.

02:12:01.782 --> 02:12:02.909
I will go.

02:12:05.203 --> 02:12:06.829
I will accept the offer.

02:12:14.712 --> 02:12:16.339
So will we.

02:12:20.676 --> 02:12:26.516
Because you have spoken first,
your future in that world shall be good.

02:13:09.268 --> 02:13:11.353
- Where did they go?
- They killed them.

02:13:11.436 --> 02:13:15.190
How do we know he is not
leading us to our death?

02:13:15.274 --> 02:13:18.819
Sire. If my example
can be of any service,

02:13:18.902 --> 02:13:21.697
I will take 11 mice through
with no delay.

02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:32.750
- We'll go.
- We will?

02:13:32.834 --> 02:13:36.004
Come on. Our time's up.

02:13:37.505 --> 02:13:39.424
After all...

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:43.428
...we're not really
needed here anymore.

02:13:47.849 --> 02:13:50.310
I will look after it until you return.

02:13:50.393 --> 02:13:52.437
I'm afraid that's just it.

02:13:54.439 --> 02:13:56.191
We're not coming back.

02:13:59.277 --> 02:14:00.320
We're not?

02:14:01.237 --> 02:14:02.530
You two are.

02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:07.410
At least, I think he means you two.

02:14:08.369 --> 02:14:10.288
But why?

02:14:10.371 --> 02:14:13.666
- Did they do something wrong?
- Quite the opposite, dear one.

02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:15.710
But all things have their time.

02:14:15.793 --> 02:14:19.215
Your brother and sister have learned
what they can from this world.

02:14:19.298 --> 02:14:21.926
Now it's time for them
to live in their own.

02:14:24.011 --> 02:14:25.971
It's all right, Lu.

02:14:27.514 --> 02:14:30.351
It's not how I thought it would be...

02:14:30.434 --> 02:14:32.811
...but it's all right.

02:14:32.895 --> 02:14:36.565
One day you'll see, too.
Come on.

02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:12.894
I'm glad I came back.

02:15:14.312 --> 02:15:16.398
I wish we had more time together.

02:15:18.817 --> 02:15:21.194
It would never have worked, anyway.

02:15:21.278 --> 02:15:22.946
Why not?

02:15:23.029 --> 02:15:25.657
I am 1,300 years older than you.

02:15:46.219 --> 02:15:49.389
I'm sure when I'm older I'll understand.

02:15:50.432 --> 02:15:53.393
I'm older and don't think
I want to understand.

02:17:10.931 --> 02:17:13.475
Aren't you coming, Phyllis?

02:17:23.735 --> 02:17:26.530
You don't think there's
any way we can get back?

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.075
I've left my new torch in Narnia.
