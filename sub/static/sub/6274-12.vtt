on our door late at night,

explained that, uh, his clients

11:01.567 --> 11:04.535
might be willing to rescind
their charges against me,

the police investigation,

Which is why I will fight this
all the way to court.

inappropriately with a child

may have already gotten out.

didn't touch that boy.

could ruin your reputation.

cannot come from the clinic.

my hard-earned wages

Perhaps you're right.

12:38.447 --> 12:40.998
Perhaps the risk to our work
is too great.

so we can get back to work.

still upset about New York.

to talk about New York.

I-I owe you an apology.

is not what he seems.

get through this, as well.

13:14.734 --> 13:17.151

on our next book,

13:17.203 --> 13:20.504
to remove the "MD"
from my name.

to reschedule--

14:02.665 --> 14:04.832
have sat through
a million press conferences,

14:04.867 --> 14:08.168
so instead, we thought, "Why not
take an open-house approach?"
