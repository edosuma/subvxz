They call it the "Sooner State."

00:45.920 --> 00:49.506
So named for those early pioneers
who jumped the gun

who tend to live
by the principle of feast or famine.

not all legends are about victory.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.959
-You have a lot of other things going on.
-Okay, name three things.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.377
{Stammering}

15:21.378 --> 15:24.756
Geology, science club,

15:25.215 --> 15:29.385
debating, music, catfish pond.
How many more do you want?

15:29.386 --> 15:31.387
-And if l wrestle, l can't do all that?
-No.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.472
Why? Will it make me stupid?

15:32.598 --> 15:35.183
Apparently,
because that was a stupid question.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.393
Cal, l know wrestling. it’s demanding.

15:37.645 --> 15:41.022
it will take you away from other things.
Everything else just...

15:43.108 --> 15:44.400
Why now?

15:46.612 --> 15:49.405
-'Cause Mike wrestled.
-l know. You already said that.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.908
-And Dad wrestled.
-And it ate them up.

15:54.328 --> 15:57.622
Mike also got hurt,
and he was built like a car.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.584
You're a beanpole.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.835
Thanks for reminding me.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.046
Should we pretend
you're something else?

16:05.422 --> 16:07.215
No. They have
a 1 35-pound weight class.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.424
Have you forgotten that?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.426
Why are you so interested
in Mike now anyway?

16:13.430 --> 16:14.889
l don't know.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.435
l guess, l mean, he and Dad
probably spent a lot of time together.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.105
And what are... What are you thinking?

16:22.439 --> 16:25.066
He's goanna... He's goanna help you?

16:25.693 --> 16:27.443
Help you know your father?

16:30.114 --> 16:35.451
He won't. He will just disappoint you.
You have no idea who Mike is.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.619
He's my brother.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.538
Right.

16:39.248 --> 16:44.669
One you've seen maybe...
What? Once or twice in 1 0 years.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.087
Whose fault is that?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.481
Pump, you are a never-ending source
of mystery to me.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.401
LULl: Who are you talking to?

17:09.403 --> 17:10.486
No one.

17:16.785 --> 17:20.747
-What's wrong?
-l'm just trying to get this pump fixed.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.290
it’s driving me crazy.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.751
{Sighs}

17:28.005 --> 17:29.172
l want to wrestle, Luli.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.507
l thought you were.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.343
-What happened?
-l told my mom about it.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.929
-And?
-And she just about gave birth.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.306
Mmm.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.315
-You wearing that outfit to school today?
-Do you like it?

17:47.775 --> 17:49.150
it’s, uh...

17:49.902 --> 17:52.904
-it’s different.
-Good. l was aiming for different.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.740
So, you like it, then?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.367
{Sighing} Sure.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.374
l'd love to see you wrestle.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.646
Who're you looking for?

19:09.606 --> 19:10.606
Mike Charley?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.108
Yeah.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.486
l'm Calvin. His brother. ls he here?

19:36.466 --> 19:37.550
Mike?

19:39.136 --> 19:42.638
Cal. Calvin.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.475
How'd you get here?

19:47.269 --> 19:49.562
Bus. Then l walked.

19:51.481 --> 19:54.150
Can l use your bathroom?
it was a long ride.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.911
-What brought you here?
-Well, l was kind of thinking

20:05.037 --> 20:08.331
that maybe you could,
you know, show me how to wrestle?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.668
Just... Just sometime.

20:12.878 --> 20:16.255
l mean, l was thinking l'd try out
at 1 35 pounds.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.341
But l don't know much.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.304
-l don't think l'd be much good to you.
-Well, l think l could be good

20:23.931 --> 20:26.891
with the right kind of training.
Just the basics.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.478
in fact, l've been studying it a bit.
About leverage mostly, seems like.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.689
You know,
just getting the right angle and...

20:34.191 --> 20:35.608
l don't know what l'm talking about.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.692
Why do you want to wrestle
all of a sudden?

20:39.196 --> 20:40.363
l don't know.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.531
Cal, l'm just real busy right now.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.121
Coach can teach you the basics.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.083
That's why he's there.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.379
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.719
Maybe we could...
We could just visit once in a while.

21:04.721 --> 21:08.599
There isn’t... There isn’t much in my life
that you're goanna want to be a part of.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.893
l just thought
'cause we're brothers, maybe...

21:10.978 --> 21:12.228
Not right now.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.966
Hey, Jim.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.760
-Hey. How are you?
-Hey.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.556
-Can l talk to you for a minute?
-Okay.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.601
Cal's not interested in wrestling.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.189
l don't know. He seems eager to learn.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.691
He's looking for Mike.

21:59.234 --> 22:02.778
l've already lost one kid to this sport.
l don't want to go through it again.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.490
Sharon, l doubt the sport had anything
to do with it, one way or the other.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.785
Anyway, it's not really up to me
whether Cal wrestles or not.

22:11.830 --> 22:16.792
There are things about Mike
you don't know. Cal doesn't know.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.420
You know, it turns out
he wasn't as unbreakable

22:19.504 --> 22:22.048
as everybody made him out to be.
Nobody is.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.258
You know, if l say no to Cal,

22:24.384 --> 22:26.594
you're just asking
for a different kind of trouble.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.054
l'll tell you what l'll do.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.806
How about l watch him just to make sure
he's there for the right reasons?

22:32.851 --> 22:35.603
And if another Mike shows up
at tomorrow's practice

22:35.687 --> 22:39.065
willing to sacrifice everything in his life
for this,

22:39.816 --> 22:43.069
-you're going to tell him to ease off?
-Yes, l will.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.030
-At the cost of victories?
-Trust me.

22:47.240 --> 22:52.119
l... l don't really even know you,
but you... You better be telling the truth.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.706
That kid is all l got.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.835
-Sharon.
-Yeah.

23:00.837 --> 23:01.837
How is Mike?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.423
l don't know.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.276
-RED: Hey, there.
-Hey.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.821
-How's it go?
-Catch anything?

23:27.864 --> 23:30.408
Yeah. A nice shoe bass.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.828
Put up a hell of a struggle.
{Chuckling}

23:33.870 --> 23:35.413
-CAL: They always do.
-Mmm.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.669
Want to share some
of those heavy thoughts you're carrying?

23:43.880 --> 23:45.297
l don't know.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.135
Yeah, l guess so.

23:49.886 --> 23:52.430
You ever wanted something,

23:53.515 --> 23:55.891
you know, or someone,
or wanted to get someplace,

23:55.934 --> 23:58.060
but just didn't know how?

24:00.772 --> 24:01.897
Yeah.

24:02.649 --> 24:05.901
l wanted to be a Western movie star

24:06.027 --> 24:08.070
and ride off into the sunset with the girl.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.156
Like John Wayne.

24:10.657 --> 24:11.866
Why didn't you?

24:11.950 --> 24:13.742
Couldn't ride a horse.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.035
{Laughing}

24:15.495 --> 24:16.871
Well, yeah.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.248
Hmm.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.963
All right, l'll tell you.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.925
-l want to wrestle.
-Wrestle?

24:30.260 --> 24:31.302
Mmm-hmm.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.513
-What's the hold-up?
-l don't think l can compete.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.933
You ever wrestled before?

24:37.934 --> 24:40.811
-No. Never.
-That's your problem.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.771
it’s foreign to you.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.940
it’s fear of the unknown, kid.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.609
{Chuckling SOFTLY}

24:47.944 --> 24:50.613
So, who's this someone
you're looking for?

24:50.739 --> 24:52.156
Someone?

24:52.282 --> 24:55.284
You said something or someone.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.955
-it’s... it’s my brother.
-Oh.

24:59.956 --> 25:05.794
So this brother has something to do
with your wanting to wrestle?

25:07.172 --> 25:10.966
Yeah. Maybe. Why would you ask that?

25:13.595 --> 25:15.804
Old man intuition.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.768
Just follow your instincts. You'll be fine.

25:24.981 --> 25:29.568
lf you use crappie instead of worms,
you might have better luck.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.534

Good job.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.401
l got to go.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.030
l'll call you.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.285
l forgot to tell you, your brother called.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.916
He said he was wrestling or something
this week.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.429
l saw Luli at the match last night.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.100
l'd say she is all the girl you can handle.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.309
Luli's not my girl.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.480
-Does she know that?
-Ma, come on.

30:59.315 --> 31:00.315

31:04.571 --> 31:08.115
She's going through
an interesting phase right now.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.742
She needs a woman in her life.

31:11.661 --> 31:15.330
Yeah. Her mom never comes
to see her any more.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.917
She has four brothers? Wow.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.003

Are you all right?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.728
You mean,
am l going to keep wrestling?

31:37.812 --> 31:40.981
Yeah. l guess that's what l mean.

Yeah.

l mean, l can't really quit.
l'm the only 1 35-pounder on the team.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.495
And that kid was about
the best 1 35-pounder in the state,

31:55.580 --> 31:57.414
so l figure it can't get much worse.

-{GLASS Shattering}

33:22.917 --> 33:25.794
Hey, Donald. Do you think
l'm the worst 1 35-pounder in the region?

33:25.878 --> 33:27.713
You haven't officially wrestled
in enough matches

33:27.839 --> 33:30.465
to be considered the worst wrestler
in the region.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.468
According to
the State Athletic Commission.

33:34.679 --> 33:38.473
Do l think there is anyone in the region
you can defeat before the year is over?

33:39.892 --> 33:41.476
it’s mathematically possible.

33:41.894 --> 33:44.229
Oh. Well, thanks for not saying no.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.107
Hey, dingle berries.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.444
l heard your brother used to be the man.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.487
-Didn't help you too much, did it?
-So?

33:54.741 --> 33:57.951
So now he's a punk.
Losers. {Snickering}

33:58.536 --> 33:59.911
{TYRES Screeching}

34:05.501 --> 34:08.545
-Muskogee County?
-l didn't know Barrow could read.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.842
"Mike Charley,
a 28-year-old, was arrested

34:13.926 --> 34:15.342
"and charged with major assault."

34:17.847 --> 34:19.973
"Repeat offender. $5,000 bail."

34:24.270 --> 34:26.313
RED: Hello, young fellow!

34:27.523 --> 34:28.690
Hello.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.984
Hey, l haven't seen you in a bit.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.571
-Yeah.
-How'd that wrestling thing turn out?

34:35.531 --> 34:36.656
Oh, uh...

34:37.574 --> 34:40.534
Yeah, l'm quitting. Wasn't right for it.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.913
According to whom?

34:44.165 --> 34:46.666
Well, l haven't won a single match.

34:46.958 --> 34:50.337
Not surprising.
Seeing as how a month ago,

34:50.505 --> 34:52.880
you didn't know a wrestling mat
from a bath mat.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.551
How's that brother of yours?

34:59.514 --> 35:00.555
He's, uh,

35:00.932 --> 35:02.182
not really interested.

35:02.934 --> 35:07.104
l know a little something about brothers.
l had eight of them.

35:07.563 --> 35:11.566
lf you need your brother,
l can promise you that he needs you.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.693
Now, he may not know it
like you know it.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.029
But he does.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.826
Don't give up
on that wrestling thing. Yeah.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.578
l have a good feeling about you.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.600
Hey.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.645
-What are you doing?
-l need to borrow your scooter.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.355
l'll bring it back tonight.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.071
-Are you in trouble?
-No.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.990
l need you to give this note
to Coach Tenant. Promise?

36:00.074 --> 36:01.283
Yeah.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.994
Wow, this is exciting.
l feel like we're eloping.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.203
Yeah, except you isn’t coming.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.291
At least kiss me goodbye.

36:11.085 --> 36:12.210
All right.

36:14.213 --> 36:18.091
-Thank you. l owe you one.
-l'll be collecting, too.

36:18.217 --> 36:19.467
And it won't be on the cheek!

36:19.594 --> 36:20.802
All right.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.055
{Engine Startling}

36:40.281 --> 36:43.658
LAWYER: Your Honour,
my client's altercation with Mr Brock

36:43.659 --> 36:47.537
was a reaction to
both physical and verbal taunts.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.665
l believe Mr Charley felt
that he was fighting for his life.

36:51.125 --> 36:54.502
in addition, he has made arrangements
to enter into alcohol rehab

36:54.670 --> 36:57.797
and personal therapy to address
his issues with anger management.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.676
l would ask, at this time,
that the Court allow my client

37:01.677 --> 37:04.679
to pursue this
under the state's supervision.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.932
Thank you, Counsel.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.685
Mr Charley,
anything you care to add, sir?

37:14.690 --> 37:16.024
{Sighs}

37:17.026 --> 37:18.485
Your Honour,
l don't go looking for trouble.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.946
l got put in a situation,

37:21.822 --> 37:23.490
well, l reacted the only way l know how.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.951
You seem to have a history of that,
Mr Charley.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.245
CAL: Your Honour. Ma'am?

37:30.039 --> 37:33.083
Hi. May l say something on his behalf?

37:33.584 --> 37:35.085
Tell the Court your name, please.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.713
Calvin Charley. Mike Charley’s brother.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.716
Step forward. Please.

37:49.558 --> 37:53.728
My dad died when l was young.
And my mom works a lot.

37:55.064 --> 37:59.484
But Mike sort of took the place of my dad
after he passed on.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.781
And he teaches me a lot of things
that my mom can't.

38:05.741 --> 38:09.744
Your brother is in a lot of trouble.
You do realise that, don't you?

38:09.745 --> 38:11.871
Yes. Yes, ma'am, l do.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.417
But l think that sometimes
guys come after Mike

38:15.543 --> 38:17.961
'cause they see him
as some kind of a target.

38:18.087 --> 38:22.090
And he and l have this deal, right,
where l will go out with him

38:22.174 --> 38:24.134
and l'll always step in
if any kind of trouble starts

38:24.593 --> 38:26.177
so he can just walk away.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.766
l just... l wasn't there this time.

38:33.352 --> 38:36.229
Your Honour,
l'm goanna give you my word

38:36.355 --> 38:39.649
that you won't see either one of us
in your courtroom ever again.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.363
l need Mike.

38:49.243 --> 38:51.536
We kind of carry each other.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.792
He's all l got.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.771
-You hungry?
-Yes.

39:17.813 --> 39:20.815
l'm really hungry. Yeah.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.068
What do you want?

39:24.987 --> 39:27.947
l don't know. it’s been a lot of years.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.075
l meant what do you want to eat?

39:30.993 --> 39:32.577
Oh! {CHUCKLES}

39:32.661 --> 39:33.828
Okay. Um...

39:34.413 --> 39:35.830
Sorry, l...

39:36.207 --> 39:38.416
l don't know. l'm kind of having trouble
with my weight.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.710
You know, keeping it down.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.009
Thanks. Actually, l'm starving.

39:56.602 --> 39:59.729
You know, Mike,
l don't want anything from you.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.190
l just want to know you.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.818
Cal, l been alive 28 years.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.862
l just couldn't tell you much
about the last eight or so.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.866
-What happened?
-l don't know.

40:12.451 --> 40:15.703
One day Dad was there
and we had a plan. And then...

40:18.290 --> 40:19.833
Well, then he wasn't.

40:23.879 --> 40:28.883
Luli? Hey! l was hoping to catch you.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.223
-Hey, Mrs Charley.
-Your old scooter finally quit?

40:37.852 --> 40:40.437
Well, it isn’t been running too good.
That's for sure.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.939
You wouldn't happen to know
where Cal is, would you?

40:44.900 --> 40:47.068
-Wrestling practice, l imagine.
-No.

40:47.486 --> 40:50.905
No. l went by the gym on my way home.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.909
-Hmm?
-Mmm?

40:55.536 --> 40:58.872
Yeah. He got up
awful early this morning.

40:59.582 --> 41:00.665
Too early.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.711
-He does like to study.
-Yes, he does.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.922
And you're not a very good liar, darling.

41:07.923 --> 41:11.468
Well, ma'am, l only had two ways to go.

41:11.552 --> 41:14.929
Lie to you
or break a promise to my best friend.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.557
Fair enough. l'm just worried about him.

41:17.683 --> 41:20.935
One thing l know about Cal is
he'll be all right.

41:21.812 --> 41:22.937
lf that helps.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.940
Okay. l appreciate that.

41:27.693 --> 41:31.279
Come by sometime. We'll do girl things.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.157
l'd like that, ma'am.

41:37.411 --> 41:38.828
So l won the geology essay competition

41:38.954 --> 41:41.956
and used the winnings
to build a catfish farm.

41:41.957 --> 41:46.002
it makes me a little bit of money
when l can actually keep it running.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.964
Mostly l just like to go out there
and think.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.008
Mom know you're here?

41:53.344 --> 41:56.971
No. No, she doesn't know l'm here.
So l should probably go.

42:02.978 --> 42:03.978
How is she?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.441
She's... She's okay.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.987
l think she wishes she had girls.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.741
She misses you.

42:19.119 --> 42:20.995
Cal, l stayed away

42:23.999 --> 42:25.250
because...

42:29.004 --> 42:30.046
You want me to teach you
how to wrestle?

42:32.800 --> 42:37.554
No. No, Mike, you've got a lot going on.
it’s not that important.

42:39.598 --> 42:41.432
Yes, l would love it
if you'd teach me to wrestle.

42:51.485 --> 42:54.696
-l'll do the best l can.
-Me, too.

43:03.163 --> 43:04.664
{CHUCKLES}

43:14.258 --> 43:15.508
Where have you been?

43:17.928 --> 43:19.053
Nowhere.

43:20.598 --> 43:21.848
Just hanging out with friends.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.085
What is this place?

43:53.088 --> 43:54.213
Church.

43:56.091 --> 43:57.342
You ready?

43:58.427 --> 44:00.094
-Hey!
-Okay.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.555
Three parts to become
a complete wrestler.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.516
Offence, defence, and psychology.

44:07.353 --> 44:11.564
We'll talk psychology later.
Today we're goanna work on speed.

44:12.316 --> 44:15.526
Leverage. Knowledge and strength.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.944
Okay.

44:17.905 --> 44:18.988
We're goanna have to build yours.

44:19.114 --> 44:20.114
{GRUNTS}

44:24.244 --> 44:25.536
{SCOFFS}

44:26.747 --> 44:29.123
Oh! He's back. Drinks all around.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.250
What, did you take
a little vacation, Charley?

44:32.002 --> 44:33.127
You wish.

44:33.128 --> 44:35.880
Funny.
No one seemed to notice you missing.

44:35.964 --> 44:37.965
-Why'd you bring it up then?
-Cal, l need you right now.

44:38.092 --> 44:40.259
The rest of you circle up.
Get started on your own.

44:41.136 --> 44:42.553
Hey, circle them up. Let's go.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.314
Cal, we had to forfeit the match
because of you.

44:54.274 --> 44:57.360
Now, l give each one of my wrestlers
one shot to save their ass

44:57.486 --> 45:00.154
before l toss them from the team.
This is your shot.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.157
l had to help my brother with something.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.494
Screw up again and you're done.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.287
-Do we understand each other?
-Yes, sir.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.872
All right.
Now get out there with the rest of them.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.165
Thank you, sir.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.795
Lebrowski, l see you.

45:16.171 --> 45:17.338
it’s called a watch. Get one.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.180
Cal, get up.

45:26.890 --> 45:29.142
Back straight. Back straight.
Move with your back straight.

45:29.184 --> 45:32.145
That's where you get your strength.
And when you circle...

45:34.565 --> 45:36.315
Look at my left leg.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.568
Don't take your eyes off it. Look at it.

45:39.194 --> 45:41.195
And when you're ready
to make your move,

45:41.280 --> 45:43.281
halfway through, switch to the right.

45:43.824 --> 45:44.991
Tie me up with the right.

45:45.117 --> 45:46.951
With your right leg on mine,
you keep me from panning out,

45:47.035 --> 45:49.412
-and take me down. You understand?
-Yeah.

45:50.205 --> 45:51.372
Here.

45:54.334 --> 45:55.918
{Grunting}

45:58.380 --> 45:59.714
{Mike Laughing}

46:00.174 --> 46:03.968
So the next time, you actually
shoot for the leg you're looking at.

46:04.803 --> 46:07.847
Or maybe you don't.
Maybe you don't look at all.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.308
You just keep coming and juke it.

46:11.143 --> 46:12.226
Knowledge.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.354
-You learn quick.
-You teach quick.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.856
{Mike Laughing}

46:17.232 --> 46:20.610
Hey, l read you once pinned a guy
with a reverse cradle in a close match.

46:20.736 --> 46:21.819
Yeah, reverse cradle.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.238
That's not a move you want to shoot for,

46:24.239 --> 46:26.407
especially against a wrestler
who is any good.

46:26.533 --> 46:28.826
it’s an easy way to get pinned
if you don't know what you're doing.

46:30.078 --> 46:32.246
-How does it work?
-{Laughing} Easy, bud.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.665
Let's learn to walk
before we can run, okay?

46:34.792 --> 46:36.042
Yeah.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.044
Hey, did you get a job yet?

46:40.047 --> 46:41.839
-No.
-l got you one.

46:43.592 --> 46:45.176
Through my geology class.

46:45.260 --> 46:46.636
l know some guys
at Sooner Pipe Works.

46:47.429 --> 46:50.097
They can get you off the rigs, you know.
Put you in a truck.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.349
Servicing the online wells.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.562
Money isn’t bad. it’s pretty steady.

46:59.107 --> 47:04.028
-l isn’t out of line about that, am l?
-{Laughing} No. No, l just...

47:05.197 --> 47:06.489
l isn’t used to getting that kind of help.

47:14.790 --> 47:15.998
What was it like working with Dad?

47:24.633 --> 47:25.800
{SOFTLY} l tell you, man. it wasn't work.

47:28.053 --> 47:30.596
it just seemed like Dad always knew
what to do with me.

47:32.224 --> 47:33.307
Yeah.

47:36.311 --> 47:37.728
-You finish your homework?
-Yep.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.147
-Want to do mine?
-No.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.945
{Grunting}

47:54.830 --> 47:56.330
Nice hiney.

47:56.874 --> 48:00.126
Thank you. Speaking of hineys,
my mom wants you to stop by.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.337
-Your mom wants to see my hiney?
-She didn't say.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.300
All right. Tell me about your opponent
for tomorrow.

48:10.053 --> 48:13.472
He's five and five.
l've never seen him before,

48:13.557 --> 48:15.141
but he lost to a kid
who beat me 11 to two.

48:15.934 --> 48:16.976
All right.

48:18.353 --> 48:20.062
You know, Mom's probably
goanna be there tomorrow.

48:20.564 --> 48:21.772
Good.

48:22.941 --> 48:24.108
Are you goanna talk to her?

48:26.361 --> 48:30.072
Cal, l never said anything
about going to meets.

48:30.365 --> 48:33.075
-You understand.
-No, l don't understand.

48:33.368 --> 48:35.453
There's goanna be a lot of folks
in that gym.

48:35.579 --> 48:37.914
They're goanna want to talk to me
about what l've been doing lately.

48:40.375 --> 48:42.376
instead of those trophies
l won ten years ago.

48:45.380 --> 48:47.173
That's including Mom.

48:47.591 --> 48:49.300
Tomorrow's about you.

48:49.384 --> 48:50.718
l'm not going to get in the way
of your match.

48:51.303 --> 48:54.388
-When are you going to talk to Mom?
-{SHARPLY} That's not why we're here.

48:55.307 --> 48:57.391
No, l... l know.

49:02.689 --> 49:04.190
Psychology.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.819
1 29 and a half. Step down, please.

49:09.404 --> 49:10.947
The first time you see your opponent
is the weigh-in.

49:11.031 --> 49:12.823
Official: Next weight class, 135.
Claremore?

is such a risk

-Whatever's on tap is fine.
-You got it.

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:44.184
Here you go.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:29.729
l don't want to do this, man.

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.898
l don't think you've got
a whole lot of choice in the matter.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.578
{Grunting}

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.256
{GRUNTS}

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:59.235
{PHONE Ringing}

01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:04.866
Hello?

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.203
What?

01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:11.873
{Stammering} What?

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:15.043
Where?

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:19.255
l... l can't understand you.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:25.678
Cal?

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:31.059
Was that Mike?

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:35.230
Why is he calling you?

01:10:35.981 --> 01:10:37.607
What did he say?

01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:40.693
l don't know. He's drunk.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.279
{SCOFFS} No, he's not drunk.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.240
He's in jail!

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:47.075
That's bullshit, Mom. He's not drunk.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.701
How would you know?

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:50.328
{Shouting} Cal, how would you know?

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:52.455
Because l see him every day!
That's how l know!

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:54.707
We've been working on the mat
every day for the last month.

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:57.418
He hasn't had one drink the whole time,
so something happened.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:58.628
-A month?
-Yes, a month!

01:10:58.712 --> 01:11:00.088
And that's where you've been?

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.547
How else do you think
l've won anything, Mom?

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:02.715
Coach Tenant.

01:11:02.716 --> 01:11:04.717
He's working with two dozen
different wrestlers, Mom! Come on!

01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:07.095
How and where did you find Mike?

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:09.806
in his house. it’s not that hard
if you're really looking for him.

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:13.685
Stop it. That's not what l'm asking you.
This is me you're talking to!

01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:15.728
You've never kept anything
from me before.

01:11:15.854 --> 01:11:18.147
You've just spent more time with Mike
in the past month

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.734
than l have in the past ten years!
And you don't even know him

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.152
and you don't think l should know?

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:24.362
l didn't want it to go wrong.

01:11:24.488 --> 01:11:25.571
-What?
-Mike.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.532
-Why?
-Because...

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:30.743
Because he's my brother.
l have the right to know my own brother.

01:11:58.772 --> 01:12:02.191
{SOFTLY} What did the two of you
talk about? Huh?

01:12:03.777 --> 01:12:05.194
Wrestling.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.156
That's it?

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:12.160
Work and school.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:16.414
it’s not like we talk about the wives
or kids or our favourite colours.

01:12:17.624 --> 01:12:19.167
l mean, l don't even know him
that well, do l?

01:12:19.793 --> 01:12:21.794
That's not fair, Cal.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.883
l was afraid of you and Mike together.

01:12:27.634 --> 01:12:29.385
-Why?
-Mike is

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:31.804
unpredictable.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.391
l became afraid of him. l...

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.811
l didn't know how to help him.

01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:45.610
But you're the best friend l've ever had.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.538
What exactly happened in the car?

01:12:58.665 --> 01:12:59.916
{Sighing} Mmm.

01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:04.837
Your dad and Mike

01:13:07.841 --> 01:13:12.845
were headed to Eufaula
to scout one of Mike's opponents.

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:16.140
That's what they did.
These guys were prepared, Cal.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:22.271
But there was...
There was heavy snow, ice.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.985
Mike was thrown from the car.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.865
Mac wasn't.

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:37.412
l begged them not to go.

01:13:38.997 --> 01:13:41.999
Dad knew Mike
could take this other kid, but...

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:47.880
And he didn't think
they needed to go, but...

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.006
But Mike pushed it.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:53.469
l remember him throwing
your dad's words back in his face.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:55.179
"Take no opponent for granted."

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.060
So Mac did what he always did.

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:04.230
He kept his word.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.819
Did Mike quit wrestling after that?

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:14.615
No. No. He got hurt a year later. But...

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:21.038
He really gave up
the night your dad died.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:25.668
He blamed himself for Mac's death.

01:14:26.044 --> 01:14:28.921
l think maybe... {Sniffling}

01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:31.007
What?

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.012
l was...

01:14:37.264 --> 01:14:38.347
{Sighs}

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.683
Cal, l was so lost.

01:14:40.767 --> 01:14:41.934
{Stifles SOB}

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.937
l was so devastated.

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:48.566
And l didn't know it at the time.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:53.946
But l... l blamed him, too.
And Mike felt it.

01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:56.240
{GROANS}

01:14:56.533 --> 01:15:00.953
l was 1 8 when Mike was born.
Your dad and l were just kids.

01:15:00.954 --> 01:15:03.873
He was my first.
And your first is always your baby.

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.709
l mean, you were an adult
when you came out.

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:07.960
l had to ask for your lD.

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:09.587
{Chuckling}

01:15:12.132 --> 01:15:14.258
Then l lost both of them.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.553
Ma, you said

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:20.973
that Mike blamed himself

01:15:22.142 --> 01:15:24.143
for Dad's being killed?

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:27.146
l mean, did anybody ever tell him
it wasn't his fault?

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:35.780
l think everybody in here has a shot
at the medal round this weekend.

01:15:36.114 --> 01:15:37.323
All right, the next couple of days,

01:15:37.407 --> 01:15:39.742
we're goanna show them
what we're made of.

01:15:39.826 --> 01:15:42.787
Let's get it in our heads
right now. Okay?

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:47.917
l'll see you guys in the morning.
Bus leaves at 7:30 sharp. Be here.

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:50.795
Let's get our hands in here.

ALL: Tornadoes!

{STUDENTS Chattering}

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.705
Something told me l should be here.

01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:10.082
Why now?

01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:15.087
Cal.

01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:19.675
He believes in you.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:23.846
{Sighing} And he was right.

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:29.101
A friend in the DA's office,

01:17:31.104 --> 01:17:34.315
a guy l dated for about 20 minutes,

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:37.068
ran down the waitress
where you were arrested.

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:39.904
She'll testify you didn't take a drink

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:43.115
and you didn't start the fight.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:49.121
l talked with your parole officer.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.751
Cal needs you, Mike.

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:56.420
it scares you, doesn't it?

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.965
Yes.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.138
{TREMULOUSLY} This scares me.

01:18:13.146 --> 01:18:16.148
But Cal really wants you
to be there for him.

01:18:18.151 --> 01:18:20.152
And l want you to be there.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.072
For Cal.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.158
You know, Mike?

01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:30.913
l've tracked you over three states.

01:18:31.164 --> 01:18:36.168
And not a day goes by that l don't think
maybe this is the day you'll show up.

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:41.340
And l'm listening to Cal tell me
that you two wrestle, that you talk!

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:43.342
And l'm thinking, "l want that."

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:46.178
l want... l want my son back!

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:48.389
But l still don't know how!

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:53.102
Let's get you out of here.

What the hell?

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:21.273
You don't belong here.

01:20:21.858 --> 01:20:24.485
-Maybe l do.
-No, you don't.

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:28.197
No.

01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:37.373
For all the goodness your dad brought
to your life, l don't believe

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.086
he ever taught you how to accept loss.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.008
it was always about showing up

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.261
prepared.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.098
l need you to show up.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.142
Maybe l'm not right for Cal.

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.231
it’s like you said,

01:21:03.316 --> 01:21:04.859
l just don't think l know how to lose.

01:21:06.319 --> 01:21:07.695
You do now.

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:12.324
This may sound simple,

01:21:15.161 --> 01:21:17.329
but that boy waiting for you

01:21:18.331 --> 01:21:21.166
hasn't experienced the pain
we've been through.

01:21:24.337 --> 01:21:25.838
l can't

01:21:27.757 --> 01:21:29.341
breathe sometimes.

01:21:34.347 --> 01:21:36.098
{TREMULOUSLY} Because in my heart,

01:21:38.351 --> 01:21:40.352
l know l blamed you at a time

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:45.941
when l should have been protecting you.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.778
And l never made it right.

01:21:51.948 --> 01:21:53.365
{Sobbing}

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.368
l am so sorry.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:03.083
l'm your mother, but l was...

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:07.379
l was choking on my grief and my anger.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:15.387
But, baby, we have to somehow

01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:19.183
put Mac to rest.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.145
{SOFTLY} Yeah.

01:22:23.688 --> 01:22:26.523
l think that's what Cal is trying to do.

He's...

{Sniffles}

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.636
{TREMULOUSLY}
l couldn't pull him from the car.

Cal... Cal is...

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:11.235
Let him.

Was l right?

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:38.595
it seems that you were.

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:41.223
ls he out now?

l'm not sure.

01:23:52.235 --> 01:23:56.196
Hopefully, he's working some things out.

01:23:56.489 --> 01:23:57.489
How'd you do?

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:01.285

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.498
Now, go wrestle.

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:10.294
When you show up, things happen.

01:24:12.505 --> 01:24:14.715
