WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.446
- (siren wails)
- Ash Williams, you're under arrest

00:08.600 --> 00:09.761
for the murder of Amber Corey.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.809
- Baal: Shh.
- There's a demon in here.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.611
He's hidden among us.
He could be in any one of you.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.286
I got a problem.
What if I'm Baal?

00:17.440 --> 00:20.125
- (screaming)
- Wait, wait, wait!

00:20.280 --> 00:21.691
You're not thinking straight.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.286
Ruby: Baal gets into people's psyches,
turning them against each other,

00:24.440 --> 00:26.647
- until they annihilate themselves.
- Thomas, this isn't you.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.371
- Don't you ever shut the fuck up?!
" (gasps)

00:29.520 --> 00:33.286
- Linda: It's over!
- Hey, toots. Come to Daddy.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.283
I'm going to send you back to hell
where you belong.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.488
And how exactly?

00:37.680 --> 00:40.126
The Necronomicon is gone,
and I'm up here.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.124
(gasping, retching)

00:43.280 --> 00:45.647
- Is that Sumerian?
- I told you I'm him.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.202
No, Pablo. You're not Baal.
You're our only hope of stopping him.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.882
(cat screeches)

00:59.160 --> 01:01.401
(Pablo groaning, panting)

01:03.840 --> 01:05.444
Never seen this before.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.682
The Book of the Dead
festering inside a live human body.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.650
- That's good, right? No?
- Ash.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.206
- (barking)
- (electricity buzzing)

01:18.840 --> 01:19.921
What's happening?!

01:21.320 --> 01:23.561
- Pablo?
- (roaring)

01:39.600 --> 01:41.523
- Oh, my God.
- Pablo?

01:44.200 --> 01:46.282
Come on, buddy,
quit fooling around.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.363
You're scaring me--
uh-uh, these people.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.000
Oh, no.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.403
Kelly:
Ash, what's wrong with him?

01:59.520 --> 02:02.091
- (whispers) Ash?
- Pablo?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.610
Buddy.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.085
- (gasps)
- (both scream)

02:10.039 --> 02:12.042
(music playing)

02:15.880 --> 02:17.848
Where the hell is he?!
He's a murderer!

02:18.000 --> 02:19.001
- (crowd clamoring)
- You're supposed to protect this town.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.885
You let this guy come back
and do all this right under your nose?!

02:22.040 --> 02:24.122
- Now listen to me.
- I want justice for my daughter!

02:24.280 --> 02:26.362
Justice for Amber!

02:28.080 --> 02:30.321
(slow motion yelling)

02:44.400 --> 02:46.050
It's hard, isn't it?

02:46.200 --> 02:49.090
Resisting the urge to shoot
that vile woman in the head.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.605
- (slow motion yelling continues)
- (electricity buzzing)

02:50.760 --> 02:52.250
I don't blame you.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.761
Make these people respect you,
not think of you as the guy

02:54.920 --> 02:58.527
who lost his town
and his wife to Ash Williams.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.887
(chuckfing)

03:04.440 --> 03:06.886
(crowd screaming)

03:11.360 --> 03:13.931
(yelling)

03:14.080 --> 03:15.764
Who are you?

03:17.120 --> 03:19.327
Well, uh, just like that hooker

03:19.480 --> 03:21.369
you saw in Detroit last summer?

03:22.960 --> 03:26.442
(Baal's voice) I can be
whoever you want me to be, sugar.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.007
(gasps)
Oh, Jesus.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.561
Well, the Son of God might be
a stretch, but you get the point.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.324
What's happening?

03:33.520 --> 03:34.646
(slow motion yelling)

03:34.800 --> 03:38.600
- I just want my family back.
- Oh.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.962
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.327
I could take her out,
or you could take her out.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.561
It doesn't really matter.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.167
We both know that she's not
the one that you want, so...

03:51.120 --> 03:54.602
- What are you going to do about it?
- Ash Williams is a murderer!

03:54.760 --> 03:56.808
What are you going to do about it?!

03:57.000 --> 03:59.651
(yelling continues)

03:59.840 --> 04:01.842
(indistinct whispering)

04:03.320 --> 04:05.971
Can't you just cut it out of me?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.122
Doesn't work like that.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.408
It's not like there's
a physical book inside you.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.171
It's more like you're becoming
one with the book.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.322
Like a spiritual convergence.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.124
Wait a minute,
this convergence,

04:17.279 --> 04:20.011
once it happens,
what does that mean for Pablo?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.970
Once the book
manifests completely,

04:23.120 --> 04:24.565
there'll be no Pablo.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.370
That's a nay-no.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.081
- Look, Ash, I understand--
- Do I need to spell it out to you?

04:30.240 --> 04:32.402
It's a nay-no on no-Pablo.
Are we clear?

04:32.560 --> 04:35.450
Just so you're clear,
the Necronomicon is the only way

04:35.600 --> 04:37.204
we can banish Baal
back to the underworld.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.249
Nuh-uh, I got a plan for Baal,

04:39.400 --> 04:43.041
and it doesn't involve recycling Pablo
into some stupid book.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.363
I'm going to find him, take my chainsaw,
shove it right up his ass.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.171
He is never going to
show his face to you.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.881
Even if you do somehow manage
to find him, he'll just jump bodies.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.724
(chuckles)
Way ahead of you.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.928
You see that?
That's a pet tracker.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.447
I got that 'cause Eli
kept getting into my weed stash

04:59.600 --> 05:00.761
and wandering around my trailer.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.322
All I got to do is find Baal once,
shove this down his throat.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.642
That way,
even if he sheds his skin,

05:06.800 --> 05:09.371
I can still find him,
take my chainsaw...

05:09.520 --> 05:11.284
And shove it right up Baal's ass?

05:11.440 --> 05:12.851
You're like the daughter I never had.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.571
Your chainsaw is never
going to stop Baal,

05:16.720 --> 05:18.324
no matter where you shove it.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.164
But there may be a way.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.130
If we can allow the convergence
to continue a little longer,

05:24.280 --> 05:27.762
I can isolate the right passage
to cast Baal back.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.365
Uh, okay.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.206
So maybe we can add your thing
on top of my great pet tracker plan.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.567
We get Pablo right up close,
he does his voodoo,

05:35.720 --> 05:37.449
and, well, the rest
will just fall into place.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.002
- Don't overthink it.
- Guys, Pablo's going to be...

05:47.840 --> 05:49.729
- fine.
- Get him up to my room.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.090
Do not kill Pablo.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.811
And don't get any of that crap
on my stuff.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.007
Linda, I made a promise to you,
so I'm going to go out now

05:58.160 --> 06:00.162
and find your ex-husband?

06:00.320 --> 06:02.129
Thank you, Ash.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.363
Despite everything that's happened,
I still want to make sure he's okay.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.090
Yeah, yeah, me too.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.129
Listen, don't worry
about a thing, okay?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.009
You're safe here, I promise.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.288
Woman:
Murderer! Get out!

06:13.440 --> 06:15.363
Man:
Go back to where you came from!

06:15.560 --> 06:18.484
- (crowd yelling)
- Man: Get the hell out of here!

06:18.640 --> 06:20.642
Woman:
Our children are dead!

06:21.800 --> 06:23.450
Man: Take your evil and go!

06:26.480 --> 06:28.608
Well, I found him.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.569
Thomas is out there?

06:30.720 --> 06:33.769
- What the hell is he doing?
- Ooh, I wouldn't do that.

06:38.200 --> 06:42.000
- We're good.
- Lacey, go wait for me upstairs.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.130
- (feedback sounding)
- Emery: Ash Williams!

06:45.280 --> 06:48.807
You've been ordered to surrender yourself
into my custody right now!

06:48.960 --> 06:51.406
- (crowd yelling)
- Thomas? Why are you doing this?

06:51.560 --> 06:54.484
You saw what Ash did.
You know he's protecting us.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.682
(yelling continues)

06:58.680 --> 07:02.207
All I know is if he doesn't
come out willingly,

07:02.400 --> 07:04.721
we're coming in there
to drag him out!

07:06.800 --> 07:09.883
- You hear me, Williams?!
- Okay, we cannot let this crowd in here

07:10.040 --> 07:12.361
to screw up whatever
Ruby's doing with Pablo.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.170
- I got an idea.
- (gun cocks)

07:19.800 --> 07:21.040
You want Ash?!

07:21.200 --> 07:24.283
Well, you fuckwads better know
how to walk through lead!

07:25.360 --> 07:29.206
Okay, so, I just fired a gun
at a crowd of civilians.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.362
Yeah, that's like a felony.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.728
- Hey, what-- what-what's that for?
- Protection.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.202
I'm sorry, how is salt
meant to protect him?

07:43.360 --> 07:45.203
It's not, it's meant
to protect us from him.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.449
Don't worry,
everything is going to be fine.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.922
It's just a precaution.
Right?

07:52.920 --> 07:56.561
I'm going to use an incantation
to accelerate the convergence.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.087
It's going to hurt
a lot more than this, isn't it?

07:59.240 --> 08:00.571
It'll be over quickly.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.761
(crowd yelling)

08:08.880 --> 08:10.325
Back off now,

08:10.480 --> 08:14.804
or I will fuck your faces with bullets!

08:16.400 --> 08:18.482
- Too much?
- I totally bought it.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.286
- (glass shattering)
- (thudding upstairs)

08:21.440 --> 08:23.204
Sounds like they're trying
to break in upstairs.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.521
- I'm good down here.
- (gun cocks)

08:24.680 --> 08:25.761
Okay, I'll be right back.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.929
(faint breathing)

08:35.600 --> 08:38.649
- (breathing increases)
- (heartbeat)

08:38.799 --> 08:41.371
(floorboards creaking)

08:41.520 --> 08:43.443
(breathing continues)

08:49.200 --> 08:51.931
(Ruby speaking foreign language)

08:54.080 --> 08:56.526
(speaking foreign language)

08:59.120 --> 09:01.122
(groaning)

09:04.120 --> 09:06.122
(faint growling)

09:08.440 --> 09:09.965
(screaming)

09:10.120 --> 09:12.043
Stay strong, Pablo!

09:12.200 --> 09:14.567
It feels like my skin
is going to explode!

09:14.720 --> 09:16.563
(Ruby continues
speaking foreign language)

09:16.720 --> 09:17.960
(door slams)

09:24.280 --> 09:26.282
(speaking foreign language)

09:31.840 --> 09:35.162
It looks like something's not right.
By that pendant.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.368
(gasping, groaning)

09:39.480 --> 09:41.323
Please! Please!
You have to stop this!

09:41.480 --> 09:43.642
Pablo, I need to take that pendant.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.450
- (electricity zapping)
- (snarling)

09:45.640 --> 09:48.530
- (distorted screaming)
- Fuck.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.489
(speaking in Sumerian)

10:10.160 --> 10:12.731
(floorboards creaking)

10:25.880 --> 10:27.769
(voice whispers "Ash")

10:35.200 --> 10:37.680
(creaking)

10:37.840 --> 10:39.763
(yelling in Sumerian)

10:40.720 --> 10:42.848
(screaming)

10:52.360 --> 10:53.566
(panting)

10:53.720 --> 10:56.883
Pablo. Oh, my God.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.890
(door creaking)

11:05.680 --> 11:07.682
(crowd shouting outside)

11:27.000 --> 11:29.480
- Ah!
- Both: Oh!

11:29.640 --> 11:30.721
- Chet!
- Hey!

11:30.880 --> 11:33.167
- What are you doing in here?!
- Uh...

11:35.280 --> 11:37.567
nothing.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.730
(wind howling)

11:44.640 --> 11:46.290
(growling, snarling)

11:46.440 --> 11:48.807
- (rumbling)
- Uh, Chet?

11:48.960 --> 11:50.803
- Yeah?
- We should get out of here.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.042
Right.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.964
(growling)

11:56.520 --> 11:58.602
Move your butt, Chet!

12:01.080 --> 12:03.003
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.926
They have the book.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.122
- (wind howling)
- (wind chimes clinking)

12:45.200 --> 12:46.201
(voice whispers "Ash")

12:50.200 --> 12:52.123
What the hell
were you doing in that room?

12:52.280 --> 12:55.124
Dude, there's a huge mob
coming for you.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.281
I came to warn you!

12:56.440 --> 12:59.250
What were you doing
in Cheryl's room with her stuff?

13:01.240 --> 13:03.527
Oh, wait!
Is that Cheryl's room?

13:03.680 --> 13:05.523
- (Ash scoffs)
- Woman: Ash?

13:08.520 --> 13:10.488
Ashley?

13:22.080 --> 13:24.686
(door creaking)

13:25.560 --> 13:27.130
Ash: Cheryl?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.049
- Cheryl.
- Cheryl?

13:29.240 --> 13:32.403
Ash? Is that you?

13:32.560 --> 13:33.846
I'm scared.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.362
Yeah. It's me, Cheryl.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.447
How'd you get here, sis?

13:41.600 --> 13:45.571
I don't know.
I-l don't understand any of this.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.490
Where's Dad?

13:50.360 --> 13:53.091
Urn... Dad's not here right now.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.040
Well, you look different.
What happened to you?

13:59.320 --> 14:00.560
Pancakes?

14:00.720 --> 14:03.007
Chet?

14:03.160 --> 14:05.401
- Chet Kaminski?!
- Yep.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.688
You're all grown up.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.365
Oh.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.727
Well, uh, you look pretty good, too.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.247
Hate to rain on anybody's parade,
but, Cheryl,

14:14.400 --> 14:16.448
you're not supposed to be here.

14:17.680 --> 14:21.446
You died after you got branch-banged
by a demon tree about 30 years ago.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.648
- I died?
- Yeah.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.729
It was pretty horrific.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.410
You don't remember any of that?

14:27.560 --> 14:30.689
Seems like the kind of thing
somebody would remember.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.001
- They're trying to kill us!
- You ever shoot a gun before?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.969
What? We're not going to
try to kill them, are we?

15:24.120 --> 15:26.168
Unfortunately no.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.681
We just got to keep them at bay
as long as we can, okay?

Cool, um, I'll just, uh,
wait in your room.

Don't!
Don't go in there, it's not safe.

We are eating a giant

Are you good down here for a minute
while I try and unfuck the situation?

18:11.560 --> 18:13.528
I got it. Go.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.887
- Where have you been?
- (whispers) Shut up.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.089
- Emery: Lay down your weapons!
- Family reunion. My sister, Cheryl.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.244
- What?
- Yeah, I killed her decades ago.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.402
Now she's back.
I got to find her, and kill her again.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.483
Wait, she came back
but now you've lost her?

18:30.640 --> 18:32.210
Focus up.
We got to find Cheryl.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.010
Hey, why don't you deal
with your dead sister

18:34.160 --> 18:36.447
while I stop your inbred,
asshole neighbors

18:36.600 --> 18:38.329

18:38.480 --> 18:41.006
- Huh, hey.
- Emery: Ash!

18:41.160 --> 18:44.642
Ruby, shit's gone so sideways
it's basically upside down.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.201
Have you found the spell--

18:47.360 --> 18:50.762
- What did you do to him?
- It's working.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.091
- This is "working"?
- I've accelerated the process,

18:56.280 --> 18:59.284
but we can't control
when the specific spell will manifest.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.204
Bullshit, you can't.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.283
Pablo, listen up.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.442
You might be converging
with the book or whatever,

19:05.600 --> 19:08.251
but you are still
a fucking Ghost Beater.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.731
You call the shots,

19:09.880 --> 19:12.326
not some glorified,
demonic romance novel.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.361
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.808
I said, do you hear me?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.171
I got this.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.641
There's my powerful vagina.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.567
What do we do
when the spell appears?

19:28.720 --> 19:31.485
Put this back on him.
It'll halt any further convergence.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.967
Pablo, quit fucking around.

19:35.120 --> 19:38.124
Find the spell we need
to send this asshole home.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.168
(groaning)

19:50.080 --> 19:51.366
It's coming.

I don't want to play with that!

21:00.920 --> 21:03.366
- (Ash grunts)
- (horn blows)

21:03.520 --> 21:05.488
I want to play with this!

21:26.720 --> 21:29.007

21:31.360 --> 21:34.170
It worked.
Now we have the spell to defeat Baal.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.890
- Oh!
- What's wrong?

21:36.040 --> 21:39.487
(panting)
It's an old wound.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.688
All right, well, do your voodoo,
and heal yourself.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.889
- I don't do that anymore.
- What are talking about, Ruby?

21:45.040 --> 21:47.407
Wolverine that shit back together.
We don't have time.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.881
I mean I can't.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.569
My children stole my immortality.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.564
Don't look at me like that.
I don't want your sympathy.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.927
(wails)

22:00.080 --> 22:03.004
Deadite Cheryl: Come on, Ash!
We got to brush those teeth!

I told you to wait upstairs.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.008
Chill, I'm just looking for a beer.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.442
Oh, relax!
Just want one.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.090
You can pound the other five.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.089
- Oh!
- You're going to have to go through him

22:30.280 --> 22:33.602
- to get to me. (cackling)
- No way.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.923
Throughout everything,
Chet is the only friend of mine

22:37.120 --> 22:39.009
- who always stood by me.
- Oh.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.606
Never lied to me,
never let me down,

22:41.760 --> 22:44.047
never, ever, betrayed me.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.407
Uh, Ash,
I should probably tell you...

22:46.560 --> 22:50.360
- It's okay, pal. Me, too.
- Aw, you guys!

22:50.520 --> 22:52.807
So sweet!

22:53.760 --> 22:56.684
Too bad, 'cause if you
won't go through him...

22:56.840 --> 22:58.410
I will!

Man: What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

23:40.400 --> 23:42.687
Let's get one thing straight, yo-yos,

23:42.840 --> 23:45.446
I kill demons, not people.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.726
- (crowd jeering)
- Bullshit!

23:46.880 --> 23:49.884
Unless those people are demons
who look like people.

23:50.040 --> 23:54.011
And then I kill people, but they're
not really people, they're demons.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.361
- You understand?
- (crowd shouting)

23:55.520 --> 23:57.807
In a minute, I'll prove it.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.851

- Man #2: He's full of it!

24:04.360 --> 24:07.204
Yep, any minute now.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.721
Man: What are we waiting for?
Just shoot him!

24:12.880 --> 24:15.645
Hang in there.
It's going to be worth it.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.891

- You can't stop us.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.082
We'll kill you all.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.605
Oh, my God! She's a demon.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.411
- Yep, told you so.
- Man: Do something!

25:14.560 --> 25:17.404
- Woman: Oh, please, Ash!
- Man: Help us!

25:17.560 --> 25:19.847

25:20.000 --> 25:21.923
(buzzing)

25:22.120 --> 25:25.044
Hey, Cheryl, remember the time
we played hide-and-seek?

25:25.200 --> 25:27.851
I hid in the trunk of the car, and you
locked me in, wouldn't let me out?

25:28.040 --> 25:29.565
(chuckles)
Remember that?

25:29.720 --> 25:32.166
- So do I.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.846

25:36.960 --> 25:39.566
- (gasping)
- (snarling)

25:42.040 --> 25:46.090
And that, Elk Grove,
is how you take care of business.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.641
Well, Cheryl,
it's been fun catching up.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.928
Sorry I got to kill you.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.971
Again.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.884
- (buzzing)
- (screaming)

26:08.320 --> 26:10.482
I hope we all
learned something today.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.011
(Deadite Cheryl groans)

26:13.160 --> 26:15.162
Not again.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.051

26:23.680 --> 26:25.762
- Ash, behind you!
- What's that?

26:35.440 --> 26:37.329
So you're Baal?

26:37.480 --> 26:40.484
Good,
because I'm carving you up next.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.564
Shh.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.808
(Baal's voice)
Let's stop arguing.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.925
Wouldn't it be much easier
to work together?
