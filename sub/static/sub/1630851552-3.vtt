00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.900
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:38.330 --> 00:40.165
"Otis and the Kittens."

00:59.518 --> 01:02.145
Cock-a-doodle-do!

01:03.647 --> 01:05.147
Good morning, Sal.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.234
Guess I'm the last one up.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.448
Good morning, Polly.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.998
Thank you, Otis.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.378
There we go. Now, let's get
these hay bales up into that barn.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.467
One. Two. Three.

01:35.804 --> 01:36.889
Hi, Mama Cat.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.974
Hi there, Otis.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.644
Come here. I wanna show you something.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.189
What do you wanna show me?

01:51.528 --> 01:53.697
These are my new baby kittens.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.367
Hi there.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.662
They're so cute, Mama Cat.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.788
Thank you.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.833
They're very sleepy,
but I wanted you to meet them.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.799
Why is this little guy all alone?

02:13.550 --> 02:14.885
That's my Frisky.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.347
He just loves being cozy
inside that old hat.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.307
Hi, Frisky.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.184
I'm Otis.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.072
Hold the hay.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.242
This kitty wants to play!

02:38.325 --> 02:39.326
Don't you?

02:46.959 --> 02:49.837
It's okay. You two have fun.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.635
Let's play outside, Frisky.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.763
Come on!

03:04.434 --> 03:05.561
Can't catch me.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.523
Oh, Frisky.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.942
Where are you?

03:15.362 --> 03:17.406
I didn't see you back there.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.533
Wanna go for a ride?

03:33.297 --> 03:35.716
Here comes Frisky!

03:41.889 --> 03:43.098
Hit the brakes!

03:44.641 --> 03:45.851
That's Polly.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.187
She sounds worried.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.480
Let's get rolling to help.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.697
No wonder Polly was barking.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.699
Look at all that smoke.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.327
We need to call for help.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.037
I can do that.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.421
Oh, no! The barn!

04:15.881 --> 04:17.298
I'll call the fire department.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.595
Where are you going, Frisky?

04:23.305 --> 04:25.557
Help! Someone, please help!

04:25.641 --> 04:26.975
Hit the brakes!

04:29.394 --> 04:32.314
Oh, no! Mama Cat, are you okay?

04:32.898 --> 04:36.068
We're all right, Otis.
But we're a little scared.

04:39.530 --> 04:43.075
We'd like to come down,
but it's not safe to go out the door.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.077
And we're too high up to jump.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.083
Frisky! No! We can't go inside the barn.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.626
It's not safe.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.088
We all have to stay back.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.131
Stay away from the smoke.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.721
I'm a hearty helper.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.015
There must be something I can do.

05:15.691 --> 05:18.318
Great gears! I can use the hay elevator.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.996
Franny the fire truck's here.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.959
I'm on it, Otis.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.670
I'll fizzle that fire as fast as I can.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.715
And I'll use the hay elevator
to get the cats down.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.675
I'll help.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.761
Let's get rolling to the rescue.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.229
We're gonna have to push harder.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.903
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff.

06:00.986 --> 06:05.115
I'm gonna work hard even when it's tough.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.624
Gotta get this to Mama Cat.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.129
We can do this.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.800
Just a little bit closer.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.224
Come on down, Mama Cat.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.986
Thank you, Otis.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.365
We never would've gotten
out of that barn without you.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.616
Happy to help.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.912
You're welcome, Frisky.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.417
Okay, everybody, the fire is out.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.837
-Good job, team.
-You did it.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.380
Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

07:01.463 --> 07:04.466
And thank you, Franny,
for helping put out the fire.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.801
Of course.

07:07.553 --> 07:11.306
Otis! I saw how you helped
Mama Cat and her kittens.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.642
Way to be a brave, hearty helper.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.436
And you stayed safe too.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.313
Thanks, Franny.

07:18.397 --> 07:23.485
In fact, this fire truck thinks that
you deserve to be an honorary fire deputy.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.114
Wow.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.784
Look, Frisky. I'm a fire deputy.

07:36.665 --> 07:37.875
Oh, no!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.084
Hit the brakes!

07:44.882 --> 07:46.508
Are you okay, Mama Cat?

07:51.763 --> 07:54.558
We're just a little sad
that our home is ruined.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.611
It's because of all that water
I sprayed to put out the fire.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.738
It's okay, Franny.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.698
I'm glad you saved our barn.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.285
Is it safe to go inside?

08:15.204 --> 08:16.872
Yep. All clear.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.969
It's okay, my sweet kitties.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.721
Our barn will get fixed.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.182
But, for now, we can't stay here.

08:38.809 --> 08:43.273
Mama Cat, is it okay for me
to help you find a place to stay?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.943
We would love that, Otis.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.614
You can stay with me in my barn.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.329
Now, hop on and let's get rolling.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.544
You'll have a cozy bed again in no time.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.470
There you go, Mama Cat.

09:13.554 --> 09:17.224
This should be a nice,
soft spot for your kittens to sleep.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.268
And I'll sleep right next to you.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.230
Come on.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.695
What do you think, Frisky?

09:31.446 --> 09:33.448
-Frisky?
-Frisky?

09:34.867 --> 09:36.159
Where are you?

09:36.785 --> 09:38.370
I'll find him, Mama Cat.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.788
Frisky?

09:40.706 --> 09:41.957
Frisky?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.422
Frisky, where'd you go?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.719
Oh, Frisky?

09:56.555 --> 09:58.015
There you are.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.017
What's wrong, Frisky?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.728
Don't you wanna sleep
in your new kitty nook?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.400
You wanna sleep in your straw hat.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.571
But it's soaking wet.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.823
That's why you're so sad.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.453
There must be something else
you can sleep in.

10:22.915 --> 10:23.916
Hey there.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.085
Oops.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.797
Wait. You like sleeping in a hat.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.175
And I have a hat.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.096
You can make my hat
your cozy spot for now.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.682
Really.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.894
Let's get rolling to the other barn
and give it a try.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.780
There you go.

11:01.787 --> 11:04.623
I'm so happy my kittens are
safe and sound.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.999
Thank you, Otis.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.296
You're welcome.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.966
On our farm, we all help each other.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.218
Sweet dreams, Frisky.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.809
Hi, Polly. Sleep tight.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.077
"Putt, Puff, Puttedy Pup!"

12:12.357 --> 12:14.067
Good morning.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.197
What a sunshiny, farm-tastic day.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.866
Good morning, Polly.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.619
Wake up, little pup. Up, up, up.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.596
That hubcap is shining light
right at you, Polly.

12:45.766 --> 12:46.767
That's better.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.145
Just a little tractor trick.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.733
You wanna play?

12:55.651 --> 12:56.735
Me too.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.781
But we've got lots of chores to do first.
Come on.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.705
Sal.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.794
It's time to get going
and do some crowing.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.588
Wha-- I need to wake up the farm.

13:16.672 --> 13:19.216
Cock-a-doodle-do!

13:31.687 --> 13:33.188
Morning, Polly.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.401
Come on, Polly-pup.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.944
Let's get in gear.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.946
We've got chores to do.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.702
Polly!

13:48.078 --> 13:50.914
We've gotta go this way, Polly. Follow me.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.254
Plowing the field, plowing the field.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.591
Plow, plow, plow, plow, plow.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.512
One job done and just a few more to go.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.476
Come on.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.980
Polly!

14:15.063 --> 14:17.274
The hay bales are this way.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.193
Let's go.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.078
Hay bales are all cleared.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.586
Hey there, Otis.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.379
Hello, Polly.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.215
Hi, Rusty.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.718
We're gonna put these hay bales
in the barn. Wanna come?

14:46.803 --> 14:48.555
Wish I could.

14:48.639 --> 14:51.433
But I'm not moving too fast these days.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.477
You two go. You're on a roll.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.354
Okay. See you later.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.441
Polly!

15:00.609 --> 15:02.027
Follow me.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.533
Okay, Polly-pup.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.993
I'll unload the hay, and then we can play.

15:17.251 --> 15:18.377
There we go.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.589
Okay, Polly, it's time to play.

15:25.801 --> 15:26.802
Polly?

15:28.220 --> 15:29.555
Polly?

15:30.264 --> 15:32.558
Oh, Polly?

15:32.641 --> 15:34.434
Did you wander off again?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.773
Hey, where'd you go?

15:40.399 --> 15:43.527
Polly, where are you?

15:45.237 --> 15:47.489
Sal. Have you seen Polly?

15:47.573 --> 15:51.368
Nope. Sorry, Otis. But I'll let you know
if I cock-a-doodle-do.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.786
Okay.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.248
Daisy. Rosalie.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.749
Have you seen Polly?

15:58.250 --> 16:01.295
No, Otis. Can't say that we have.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.505
If we do, we'll moo.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.007
Okay, thanks.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.261
Polly?

16:09.344 --> 16:12.014
Where are you?

16:12.097 --> 16:14.808
Hey, Celeste. Have you seen Polly?

16:14.892 --> 16:17.561
No. But I hope you find her soon.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.396
It's getting dark.

16:24.276 --> 16:26.445
Polly?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.489
It is getting dark.

16:29.573 --> 16:30.949
Hit the brakes.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.410
Polly might be lost.

16:33.911 --> 16:35.329
And scared.

16:38.332 --> 16:39.833
I'm a hearty helper.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.252
There must be something I can do.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.837
I'm gonna find her.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.298
Let's get rolling!

16:47.841 --> 16:49.009
Polly?

16:50.010 --> 16:51.428
It's so dark.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.055
It's hard to see.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.266
That's better.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.561
Polly?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.191
My headlights.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.109
They're not working.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.446
It's so dark out here.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.910
Okay. Putt, puff, puttedy--

17:15.536 --> 17:17.329
I need to take a deep breath--

17:18.747 --> 17:20.332
…chuff.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.795
The moonlight helps a little.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.839
I wish I could take it with me.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.513
Maybe I can take the moonlight with me.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.102
Great gears. Look at that.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.896
This hubcap is as good as a headlight.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.236
Polly?

17:50.612 --> 17:52.155
Polly?

17:52.781 --> 17:54.950
It's working. I can see.

17:55.701 --> 17:57.703
I'll find you, Polly.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.206
What was that?

18:07.629 --> 18:10.465
It's just a crow cawing hello.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.634
Polly?

18:13.677 --> 18:15.220
Polly? Is that you?

18:17.181 --> 18:18.182
It's a skunk.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.060
Excuse me.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.399
The moonlight's gone.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.569
Oh, no.

18:30.652 --> 18:33.030
I can't find Polly if I can't see.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.368
Hello? Who's there?

18:40.245 --> 18:42.122
Otis? That you?

18:42.706 --> 18:43.707
Rusty!

18:44.833 --> 18:46.502
I'm so happy to see you.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.880
-What are you doing out here in the dark?
-Polly's lost.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.383
But my headlights are out,
and my hubcap stopped working.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.345
So I can't look for her.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.932
She's all alone.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.642
Hit the brakes.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.353
She must feel so scared.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.482
That poor pup.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.150
We have to find Polly.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.236
And I won't give up until we do.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.363
Maybe these can help.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.490
Yeah! Come on.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.075
Let's get rolling.

19:22.246 --> 19:26.250
-Is everything okay, Rusty?
-Oh, shucks, Otis.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.752
I can't quite go as fast as you.

19:30.671 --> 19:33.590
If I could give you
my headlights, I would.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.100
Great gears.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.351
I know!

19:46.019 --> 19:49.606
You can be my headlights,
and I can be your engine.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.567
-What do you think?
-Sure.

19:51.650 --> 19:54.319
Now, that's what I call a bright idea.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.488
Let's go find Polly.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.532
Let's get…

20:00.617 --> 20:02.327
rolling.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.293
Polly?

20:10.961 --> 20:12.629
Polly?

20:13.255 --> 20:14.756
Polly?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.008
Polly?

20:16.091 --> 20:17.551
I don't see her.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.845
-Do you, Rusty?
-Not yet.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.347
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff,

20:22.431 --> 20:24.975
we won't give up till we find Polly-pup.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.977
Polly?

20:28.103 --> 20:29.730
Polly?

20:31.148 --> 20:32.941
-Polly?
-Polly?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.403
Polly?

20:37.404 --> 20:38.989
Polly?

20:41.325 --> 20:42.576
Polly? Is that you?

20:45.454 --> 20:47.206
It's just a branch.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.957
Let's keep searching.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.922
Polly? Polly?

20:56.715 --> 20:59.468
Did you hear that?
I'd know that "arf" anywhere.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.140
And I'd know that tail anywhere.

21:07.768 --> 21:10.729
Oh, Polly. Are you scared?

21:12.814 --> 21:15.692
It's me, Otis. And Rusty too.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.950
Polly! We found you.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.788
You're welcome, Polly.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.540
I'm so glad I could help.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.334
Come on. Let's go home together.

21:41.510 --> 21:42.970
Otis!

21:43.053 --> 21:46.181
Hey, everybody! Look who we found!

21:48.725 --> 21:51.061
-Polly!
-Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

21:51.144 --> 21:53.063
Polly. We saved you dinner.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.528
I'm glad you're home too, Polly-pup.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.073
-So am I.
-Me too.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.199
Yeah.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.119
You did it, Otis.

22:07.202 --> 22:09.705
I couldn't have done it
without you, Rusty.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.666
I'm always here to help.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.877
We all help each other.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.087
On our farm, that's what we do.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.964
You said it, Otis.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.761
You're right, Polly-pup.

22:24.845 --> 22:26.388
We never got to play.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.059
I'll follow you this time.
