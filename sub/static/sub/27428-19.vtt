<i>When you hear about college,</i>

00:14.551 --> 00:17.453
<i>it's often described
as the time of your life.</i>

00:19.621 --> 00:22.010
<i>Bliss, paradise...</i>

00:22.042 --> 00:23.846
<i>- ...utopia.</i>

00:34.304 --> 00:35.938
<i>But when you're in it,</i>

00:35.971 --> 00:38.941
<i>sometimes all you feel is the stress,</i>

00:40.410 --> 00:42.212
<i>...the pressure...</i>

00:44.380 --> 00:46.615
<i>...and the loneliness.</i>

01:15.211 --> 01:16.813
What the hell's going on?

01:16.845 --> 01:18.648
Hey.

01:55.988 --> 01:58.087
Yo, I'm about to Postmates
this Jimmy John's.

01:58.121 --> 01:59.122
You want in?

01:59.155 --> 02:00.557
The halls were just flooded with EMTs

02:00.589 --> 02:02.057
because they thought a student
killed themselves.

02:02.090 --> 02:04.193
H-How are you even thinking
about food right now?

02:04.227 --> 02:05.295
I'm sorry, okay?

02:05.328 --> 02:07.197
Everybody copes with stressful
situations differently,

02:07.229 --> 02:09.232
and I'm just trying to process
what happened to P.J.

02:09.264 --> 02:11.233
So I ask you again... do you
want a tasty sandwich or not?

02:11.267 --> 02:12.568
Are you for real?

02:14.470 --> 02:16.139
Get me a six-inch Perfect Italian.

02:16.172 --> 02:18.608
Son, this P.J. shit is nuts.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.244
Yo, thank God that his roommate
saw this morbid-ass tweet

02:21.276 --> 02:23.312
and called 911.

02:23.346 --> 02:25.914
Can you imagine
what would've happened to him?

02:25.948 --> 02:28.051
They did a sweep of his room
and said they found some pills.

02:28.084 --> 02:28.985
He didn't take any.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.954
But they did find some.

02:30.987 --> 02:33.055
This whole situation is on me.

02:33.089 --> 02:33.990
What?

02:34.023 --> 02:37.827
Yeah, I have a confession to make, okay?

02:37.859 --> 02:39.762
I saw P.J.'s tweet,
but I scrolled past it

02:39.795 --> 02:41.965
to watch a video of a monkey
from Thailand attack a man.

02:41.997 --> 02:43.799
Bro, this... this is isn't on you.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.770
P.J.'s been tweeting
about being depressed.

02:46.803 --> 02:48.305
I feel like everybody is.

02:48.337 --> 02:49.805
It's crazy to me. I don't get it.

02:49.839 --> 02:53.008
So, like, since when has it ever
been cool to be depressed?

02:53.042 --> 02:55.444
Since all these rappers started
confessing about their struggles

02:55.477 --> 02:57.646
and everybody thought
that shit was cool.

03:01.017 --> 03:02.651
I swear, every time I'm on IG,

03:02.685 --> 03:05.121
I'm seeing people post about their
feelings and what meds they're on.

03:05.154 --> 03:07.122
Yeah, but that's what I'm
talking about...

03:07.156 --> 03:09.125
people doing it just for the flex.

03:09.157 --> 03:10.626
Like P.J.

03:10.660 --> 03:12.996
He was all about
that whole sad-boy wave.

03:13.029 --> 03:15.597
But that doesn't mean the guy
wasn't really suffering.

03:15.631 --> 03:17.000
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, but it's impossible

03:17.032 --> 03:20.102
to tell who's <i> really</i> doing it
for the flex

03:20.136 --> 03:21.371
or who's actually struggling.

03:21.404 --> 03:24.206
Maybe, but this... this happened <i>
way</i> too close to home.

03:24.239 --> 03:25.641
So I'm going to make it my mission,

03:25.674 --> 03:27.142
I'm gonna do whatever it takes

03:27.175 --> 03:28.444
to find out if anyone who's living here

03:28.477 --> 03:29.978
is really going through something

03:30.012 --> 03:32.982
or they're just... you know,
walking around being dramatic.

03:33.014 --> 03:36.720
Oh, I'm sooo depressed!

03:36.752 --> 03:40.190
My life is literally just over.

03:41.191 --> 03:43.293
<i>This dude hasn't left
the house for 2 1/2 years.</i>

03:43.325 --> 03:44.894
Uh, did y'all not hear what I just said?

03:44.926 --> 03:47.563
Uh, Zoey, we're watching a documentary

03:47.597 --> 03:49.566
about an 800-pound man named Robert

03:49.598 --> 03:51.167
who's fused to his couch.

03:51.199 --> 03:52.334
So, uh...

03:52.368 --> 03:55.672
- Big Rob's life is over.
- You're being melodramatic.

03:55.704 --> 03:57.706
- Yeah.
- I'm not.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.408
My major got declined.

03:59.442 --> 04:03.980
Um... I didn't get into
the School of Fashion, so...

04:04.013 --> 04:06.583
Again, Big Rob can't see his own penis.

04:06.615 --> 04:09.017
Why would they reject you?

04:09.050 --> 04:10.018
I don't know.

04:10.051 --> 04:11.988
Something about having a low GPA

04:12.020 --> 04:13.355
and being on academic probation

04:13.388 --> 04:15.824
and dropping some mandatory
fashion class last semester.

04:15.857 --> 04:17.494
- It's literally insane.
- Come here.

04:17.527 --> 04:21.596
- I know, this really sucks.
- Mm-hmm.

04:21.630 --> 04:23.566
But you're still gonna do
the Fundie Run, right?

04:23.590 --> 04:24.533
No!

04:24.558 --> 04:26.236
God, I have no desire
to run around half-naked

04:26.268 --> 04:29.204
in a race that's supposed to
celebrate declaring a major!

04:29.237 --> 04:30.874
Which I don't have!

04:30.907 --> 04:32.876
On the bright side,
you don't need one to run.

04:32.909 --> 04:34.778
- We did it when we were freshmen.
- Mm-hmm.

04:34.811 --> 04:36.412
Whupped everybody's ass, too.

04:36.446 --> 04:38.047
And we're gonna do it again this year.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.785
You guys do realize, though,
it's just chaos in underwear?

04:41.818 --> 04:44.187
- It's not, like, a real race.
- Oh, baby girl,

04:44.220 --> 04:47.190
when you've been training
all year for the NCAA finals,

04:47.222 --> 04:49.057
everything in life is a race.

04:58.934 --> 05:01.203
If I wasn't wearing wedges,
I would've had that ass.

05:01.237 --> 05:02.472
I don't think y'all get it.

05:02.504 --> 05:04.106
This isn't about some stupid race.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.443
I mean, sure, maybe I'm being
a bit melodramatic

05:06.475 --> 05:07.876
by saying my life is over,

05:07.910 --> 05:11.580
but my dream of majoring in fashion is.

05:14.850 --> 05:17.052
I mean, Robert had dreams, too.

05:17.085 --> 05:18.987
All right. Excuse me. Hey, guys!

05:19.020 --> 05:21.758
Thank you so much
for taking the time to be here.

05:21.790 --> 05:23.492
I really do appreciate it.
Let's get to it.

05:23.525 --> 05:24.660
- I wanted to...
- Yo. Yo.

05:24.693 --> 05:26.429
What time does the shrimp truck come?

05:27.629 --> 05:29.064
There's a slight delay
on the shrimp truck.

05:29.097 --> 05:30.667
In the meantime, I thought
we could, you know,

05:30.700 --> 05:33.136
- roundtable a bit, chop it up.
- Wait. Wait, wait.

05:33.169 --> 05:35.839
Like, how long are you talkin'
for the shrimp, though?

05:38.207 --> 05:39.242
Five minutes.

05:39.275 --> 05:41.611
Like... Like a <i> regular</i> five
or Black five?

05:44.145 --> 05:45.948
There's no shrimp. I don't have shrimp.

05:45.982 --> 05:47.650
I'm sorry. There never was
a shrimp truck coming.

05:47.683 --> 05:49.519
- I don't have the money for it. Sorry.
- You got me

05:49.551 --> 05:51.087
all [bleep] up, Aaron, okay?!

05:51.119 --> 05:53.188
I understand
your frustration, Rafael, I do,

05:53.222 --> 05:55.694
but I gathered you guys here
to discuss mental health.

05:55.719 --> 05:56.813
That's what we need...

05:56.837 --> 05:57.983
No, we need... Guys, come on.

05:58.008 --> 05:59.210
- We need this.
- I told you,

05:59.235 --> 06:01.960
you can't promise Black people
shrimp, bro.

06:01.985 --> 06:04.708
Whatever. I decided that
it was best to check in

06:04.733 --> 06:06.622
after what happened to P.J.
That's our friend.

06:06.647 --> 06:08.325
I just want to see how
everybody's feeling.

06:08.350 --> 06:10.940
Hungry, [bleep]! Hungry!

06:10.972 --> 06:12.174
Funny. Anyway...

06:12.208 --> 06:13.208
The school gave me

06:13.242 --> 06:15.177
this cool, little
crisis prevention handbook,

06:15.210 --> 06:17.280
and I just want to float
a few questions by you.

06:17.313 --> 06:18.882
Here we go. First question...

06:18.914 --> 06:21.317
does anyone have a history of
mental illness in their family?

06:23.219 --> 06:24.821
No?

06:24.854 --> 06:26.789
Gran-Daadi Vikash heard voices.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.223
Okay.

06:28.256 --> 06:29.893
Good. Uh, second question...

06:29.926 --> 06:32.395
Do you ever feel despondent
and don't know why?

06:37.066 --> 06:39.469
Oh, so, I'm the <i> only</i> one
that feels a little melancholy

06:39.501 --> 06:41.037
when my head hits the pillow at night.

06:41.070 --> 06:42.672
Great. Appreciate the participation.

06:42.705 --> 06:44.240
Does anyone besides Vivek

06:44.273 --> 06:48.210
ever find themselves
anxious about the future?

06:48.244 --> 06:50.078
I mean...

06:50.112 --> 06:52.553
I feel anxious about the lack
of shellfish in my future.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.641
Yo, come on, man,

06:53.665 --> 06:54.757
he's trying to do something, bro.

06:54.758 --> 06:56.084
- Be serious.
- Thank you.

06:56.109 --> 06:57.702
O-Okay. Well, seriously,

06:57.727 --> 06:59.061
if I had a problem,

06:59.086 --> 07:02.130
I wouldn't sit around here,
being sad and anxious.

07:02.162 --> 07:03.772
I'm gonna either pray it out,

07:03.796 --> 07:05.192
I'm-a sweat it out...

07:05.193 --> 07:07.318
...or if that don't work,
I'm gonna light up.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.294
Okay, so...

07:08.319 --> 07:10.061
Yeah, you must be living your best life,

07:10.099 --> 07:12.730
'cause your hairline is... ♪ Traaaash ♪.

07:12.755 --> 07:14.839
Okay, okay.

07:14.864 --> 07:16.269
So, I understand that you guys think

07:16.301 --> 07:17.546
that what I'm trying to do is whack,

07:17.573 --> 07:20.676
but I'm really just trying
to create an environment

07:20.710 --> 07:22.210
so that we can have an open dialogue

07:22.244 --> 07:24.639
about what's really going on
in our lives, okay?

07:24.671 --> 07:25.955
So please, bear with me.

07:25.982 --> 07:27.514
Are any of you experiencing

07:27.539 --> 07:30.619
a sense of isolation
or depersonalization?

07:33.388 --> 07:35.691
Um... I'm sorry.

07:35.725 --> 07:37.527
I don't even know what that means.

07:37.559 --> 07:39.962
It's like when you feel disconnected

07:39.996 --> 07:42.966
or not like yourself.

07:42.999 --> 07:46.469
You're, like, the passenger
in your own mind.

07:46.501 --> 07:49.364
Kind of like how, uh, Kid Cudi felt

07:49.389 --> 07:50.676
when he made the "Pursuit of Happiness".

07:50.701 --> 07:53.643
- You know that song?
- Yeah. Okay, yeah.

07:53.676 --> 07:55.411
In that case,

07:55.436 --> 07:58.146
I've been hella depersonalized before.

07:58.179 --> 08:00.215
Okay, good! This is great.

08:00.249 --> 08:01.883
Communication, dialogue.

08:01.917 --> 08:03.318
Now, has anyone ever felt like a rapper

08:03.352 --> 08:05.455
whose name starts with Lil'
or thought about,

08:05.487 --> 08:07.222
I don't know, getting face tattoos?

08:10.126 --> 08:11.260
Okay.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.462
All right.

08:13.496 --> 08:14.998
All right. Well...

08:15.030 --> 08:17.766
I think we need to get these
people some shrimp.

08:20.813 --> 08:23.172
I just don't want to let anyone down.

08:23.205 --> 08:25.617
There's <i> so</i> much pressure.

08:25.642 --> 08:28.466
Between trying to keep my grades up

08:28.491 --> 08:31.060
and missing my family,

08:31.093 --> 08:34.496
I feel like sometimes I can't
even shake the sadness.

08:36.565 --> 08:37.499
I get that.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.570
There's sometimes I wake up and
I feel like I just, you know,

08:40.602 --> 08:42.871
can't get out of bed.

08:42.904 --> 08:45.440
Okay, so, when you guys feel like this,

08:45.474 --> 08:47.109
how do you go about dealing with it?

08:47.143 --> 08:49.644
- I don't.
- You don't?

08:49.677 --> 08:51.413
Wait, but you don't think
you should, I don't know,

08:51.446 --> 08:54.249
talk to a counselor or therapist
just to,

08:54.282 --> 08:55.417
- you know...
- I did that.

08:55.450 --> 08:56.752
Over at the health center.

08:56.785 --> 08:58.421
It was a joke.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.590
Like, a 2-week wait
for a 15-minute appointment

09:01.623 --> 09:04.460
with some old White lady
who kept telling me

09:04.493 --> 09:07.597
I look like some actress named "Jackée".

09:07.629 --> 09:09.264
That's why I don't mess with it.

09:09.297 --> 09:12.567
You just... ride it out.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.604
Okay, but has it ever gotten so low

09:14.637 --> 09:16.172
to where you feel like you...
you <i> couldn't</i> ride it out?

09:21.343 --> 09:22.478
Yo, this...

09:22.511 --> 09:24.447
this doesn't seem like a flex, bro.

09:33.122 --> 09:34.524
Here.

09:34.556 --> 09:38.594
Zucchini bread is known
to help with the sadness.

09:38.627 --> 09:40.496
And eczema.

09:40.528 --> 09:41.496
Hmm.

09:44.032 --> 09:46.536
Oh, my God...

09:46.569 --> 09:48.671
This is so good.

09:48.704 --> 09:50.306
Is there anything you can't do?

09:50.339 --> 09:51.840
- I haven't found it yet.
- Mm.

09:51.873 --> 09:54.643
Do you think this bread will
help me figure out my major?

09:54.676 --> 09:57.547
Zoey, you don't need a major
to do fashion.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.282
You barely need a major to do anything.

09:59.315 --> 10:00.383
How many people do you know

10:00.416 --> 10:02.484
that actually work in the fields
they studied?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.987
My mom. My dad.

10:05.019 --> 10:07.822
Literally anyone who's been
to college in my entire family.

10:07.855 --> 10:10.292
Okay, fine. They're weird.

10:10.325 --> 10:11.460
But real talk,

10:11.493 --> 10:14.529
this whole major thing is just
society's attempt to put us in a box.

10:14.562 --> 10:16.032
Nice, coming from the guy

10:16.065 --> 10:18.234
who got into the fashion program
freshman year.

10:18.267 --> 10:19.902
Of high school.

10:19.935 --> 10:21.804
They recruited me. But...

10:21.836 --> 10:23.538
don't make this about me, baby.

10:23.571 --> 10:25.474
Hmm. Ding, ding, ding.

10:25.507 --> 10:27.910
Think we found the one thing
he's not good at...

10:27.942 --> 10:29.345
pep talks.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.581
The point is, people in fashion
don't <i> need</i> a degree.

10:32.614 --> 10:35.150
Even <i> having</i> one puts you <i> miles</i>
ahead of the game.

10:35.183 --> 10:36.751
So why don't you just take the time

10:36.785 --> 10:39.822
to explore other stuff
you have interest in?

10:39.854 --> 10:41.590
Well, I mean, I've always been

10:41.623 --> 10:43.825
kind of intrigued by psychology.

10:43.859 --> 10:45.595
That's perfect.

10:45.628 --> 10:47.196
You have a purple aura.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.431
People love talking to you.

10:49.465 --> 10:52.468
And honestly, you'll be purple
at whatever you choose.

10:55.204 --> 10:57.173
Damn it!

10:57.205 --> 10:59.908
He is good at everything.

11:04.312 --> 11:05.947
Okay. So...

11:10.819 --> 11:12.455
You sure you don't want me
to come back when you're...

11:12.488 --> 11:14.690
when you're finished?

11:16.425 --> 11:17.760
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.695
It's a seven-day juice cleanse,

11:19.728 --> 11:21.297
but I'm-a drink 'em all in one day.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.733
Your boy figured
out how to beat the system.

11:23.766 --> 11:27.036
Why wait a whole week
just to be healthy?

11:27.069 --> 11:28.471
Pretty sure that's not how it works.

11:28.503 --> 11:31.206
I'm pretty sure it <i> is</i> how it works.

11:31.239 --> 11:32.575
Sorry.

11:32.608 --> 11:33.976
I drank 17 juices.

11:34.008 --> 11:37.279
- I'm both full and very, very hungry.
- Mm.

11:37.312 --> 11:38.614
It's so confusing.

11:38.647 --> 11:40.449
Anyway, talk to me, brother.

11:40.481 --> 11:42.984
Okay. Uh, well, I was...

11:43.018 --> 11:44.820
I was talking to some residents
at Hawkins,

11:44.853 --> 11:48.324
and I just think that they could
really use a therapist.

11:48.356 --> 11:50.792
- Just to talk to, you know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:50.825 --> 11:52.260
I'm sure everyone over at Hawkins

11:52.293 --> 11:53.895
is going through a hard time right now.

11:53.928 --> 11:55.463
Since P.J.'s incident,

11:55.497 --> 11:59.101
we are taking the situation
very, very seriously.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.336
But it doesn't seem like it,

12:01.369 --> 12:03.605
'cause I-I went to
the health center earlier today,

12:03.638 --> 12:04.907
and they said there's
a huge waiting list

12:04.940 --> 12:06.941
because there's only <i> five</i> counselors

12:06.974 --> 12:09.311
- for the entire student population.
- Ah.

12:09.345 --> 12:10.946
- That's crazy. Yeah.
- Yes.

12:10.979 --> 12:13.516
That's exactly why we're
bringing in <i> temporary</i> counselors

12:13.548 --> 12:15.518
for the students to talk to.

12:15.551 --> 12:17.119
What if these problems aren't temporary?

12:17.152 --> 12:19.488
What if... It's... It's bad enough

12:19.521 --> 12:21.022
that there's limited
resources for everybody,

12:21.056 --> 12:23.025
but there's even less for us.

12:23.057 --> 12:26.095
Do you know there's not a single <i> Black</i>
therapist in that health center?

12:26.128 --> 12:27.162
Not one.

12:27.196 --> 12:28.497
Yet we're the ones struggling

12:28.529 --> 12:29.864
with the normal stresses of college,

12:29.897 --> 12:31.667
uh, going to a predominantly
White school,

12:31.700 --> 12:32.968
and having to deal with the pressures

12:33.000 --> 12:34.602
of being Black in America.

12:34.636 --> 12:36.138
It's just... It's... It's a lot.

12:36.171 --> 12:39.709
I get it, man.

12:39.742 --> 12:41.711
I really do. I get it, man.

12:41.744 --> 12:43.680
Great. Thank you. So... So you can help?

12:46.514 --> 12:49.484
I would if I could.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.287
Cal U just doesn't have
the money in the budget.

12:54.489 --> 12:56.157
Just doesn't have...

12:56.191 --> 12:58.594
Right. Got it.

13:01.930 --> 13:05.133
You know, they'll spend millions
of dollars on a new arena

13:05.167 --> 13:07.302
to make more millions off Black bodies,

13:07.335 --> 13:08.870
but won't invest in our minds?

13:08.903 --> 13:11.172
It's... baffling to me.

13:11.205 --> 13:12.340
I'm sorry, Aaron.

13:12.373 --> 13:14.810
I wish there was... more I could do.

13:14.843 --> 13:17.213
Yeah, me too.

13:29.488 --> 13:30.580
Hey, Freshman.

13:30.605 --> 13:32.126
What's good?

13:32.151 --> 13:33.979
Just deciding my future.

13:34.018 --> 13:35.553
I'm thinking a psychology major,

13:35.579 --> 13:38.816
possible astronomy minor.

13:38.849 --> 13:40.384
You do know astronomy has nothing to do

13:40.418 --> 13:43.155
with horoscopes, right?

13:43.188 --> 13:44.489
I do now.

13:44.521 --> 13:45.790
- Right.
- Yay...

13:45.824 --> 13:48.627
Wait, so, why are you looking
for a new major?

13:48.660 --> 13:50.328
I thought you were trying to get
into the fashion school?

13:50.361 --> 13:51.663
Well, I am, but, you know,

13:51.695 --> 13:53.731
I don't have to major in it to do it.

13:53.765 --> 13:54.966
Well, good.

13:54.998 --> 13:57.702
Honestly, we need more Black
psychologists, so good for you.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.838
And at least psychology
is a... a-a real major.

14:00.872 --> 14:01.973
So is fashion.

14:02.006 --> 14:04.476
Yeah, but it's not really
helping people.

14:04.508 --> 14:07.211
Mm, fashion is all about helping people.

14:07.245 --> 14:08.213
Oh, come on, Zoey.

14:08.246 --> 14:09.581
No disrespect, but helping people

14:09.613 --> 14:11.682
is facilitating
better mental health resources.

14:11.715 --> 14:13.150
Not pairing your V-neck blouse

14:13.184 --> 14:14.653
with some low-rise Hollister jeans.

14:14.685 --> 14:15.886
- It's just...
- Mm, pause.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.856
- First of all, yuck.
- Right?

14:17.888 --> 14:18.989
And second of all,

14:19.022 --> 14:21.058
it's not just about
creating someone's look.

14:21.092 --> 14:23.261
I mean, it's...
it's honestly an extension

14:23.294 --> 14:24.763
of who that person is.

14:24.795 --> 14:26.897
An expression of identity,

14:26.930 --> 14:30.868
of our wants, our... p-political views.

14:30.901 --> 14:33.104
Political views.

14:33.137 --> 14:34.839
Oh, my... Are you kidding?
Think about it.

14:34.872 --> 14:37.342
Like, the suffragettes,

14:37.375 --> 14:38.710
uh, the Black Panthers,

14:38.742 --> 14:40.511
and, you know what, I hate to say it,

14:40.545 --> 14:42.713
- but, like, the KKK.
- Mm.

14:42.747 --> 14:45.851
They made statements with their outfits.

14:45.883 --> 14:47.785
The KKK?

14:47.819 --> 14:49.221
That was your closing argument?

14:49.253 --> 14:51.223
My closing argument is,

14:51.256 --> 14:54.025
fashion has always been
a powerful political tool

14:54.058 --> 14:57.429
used to communicate a message,
positive or negative,

14:57.462 --> 15:03.101
and that's a million percent
a real thing for me.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.369
Okay, so then, why...

15:05.402 --> 15:06.570
Well, I ask again,

15:06.603 --> 15:09.107
why are you majoring
in psychology and not fashion?

15:09.140 --> 15:12.944
Because I didn't get into
the School of Fashion, so...

15:12.977 --> 15:15.480
...now I'm at a dead end.

15:15.512 --> 15:16.781
I get that.

15:16.814 --> 15:18.550
I feel like I'm at
a dead end, too, right now.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.252
It's like, at the end of my road,

15:20.285 --> 15:22.788
there's a big brick wall.

15:22.820 --> 15:25.824
So, what's happening?

15:25.857 --> 15:28.593
Cal U doesn't give a damn
about Black mental health,

15:28.626 --> 15:32.146
and I can't get them
to do anything about it.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.630
So...

15:33.631 --> 15:36.101
you understand what I'm talking about.

15:36.133 --> 15:38.669
We're just two people sitting here,

15:38.703 --> 15:40.972
trying to save the world.

15:41.005 --> 15:42.439
Hmm.

15:42.473 --> 15:43.775
You think you're funny, huh?

15:43.808 --> 15:45.277
<i>You</i> think I'm funny.

15:45.309 --> 15:47.279
You're fine.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.149
But, you know what?

15:51.181 --> 15:52.817
Just because they're telling you "no"

15:52.851 --> 15:54.152
doesn't mean you have to listen.

15:54.184 --> 15:57.655
What you're doing
is just way too important.

15:57.689 --> 15:59.089
So screw Cal U.

15:59.122 --> 16:01.593
Sometimes you just got
to figure out a way

16:01.626 --> 16:03.694
around the wall.

16:03.728 --> 16:05.664
That is solid advice.

16:05.697 --> 16:07.444
Not bad, Sophomore, not bad at all.

16:07.469 --> 16:09.501
Mm, Sophomore?

16:09.534 --> 16:10.921
What happened to Freshman?

16:10.946 --> 16:12.782
Oh, you know, just...

16:12.816 --> 16:14.484
testing something new.

16:14.517 --> 16:16.920
<i>Talking to Aaron helped me realize</i>

16:16.952 --> 16:19.956
<i>that there was no reason
I couldn't take my own advice.</i>

16:19.989 --> 16:23.426
And looking back
on my styling experiences,

16:23.460 --> 16:26.662
I've learned to connect with
clients to help them communicate

16:26.695 --> 16:29.398
what they want to say
about themselves to the world.

16:29.431 --> 16:32.134
But I've also learned how
fashion can be used

16:32.167 --> 16:35.171
to communicate a message
on a larger scale.

16:35.205 --> 16:37.840
And so, to help me better
explore the intersection

16:37.873 --> 16:41.844
of fashion and social movements
in a comprehensive way,

16:41.878 --> 16:46.450
I'm here to ask your permission
to create my own major...

16:46.483 --> 16:48.452
the Sociology of Fashion.

17:05.902 --> 17:07.037
Hey, man.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.171
Yo.

17:10.006 --> 17:13.877
Um, I'm sorry. Why...
Why are you here, exactly?

17:13.910 --> 17:16.012
I heard what went down the other night.

17:16.046 --> 17:17.681
Yeah, it was pretty rough.

17:17.713 --> 17:20.549
You're gonna come in.
All right, come in. Sit down.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.817
- How you feeling, man?
- I don't know.

17:21.851 --> 17:23.553
A little numb, a little shocked.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.690
It all kind of feels like...
a bad dream.

17:26.722 --> 17:28.057
I feel that.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.327
I've, uh,... I've had some dark times.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.998
- Really?
- Really dark times.

17:35.030 --> 17:36.732
Came over to bring you this.

17:36.766 --> 17:39.870
It's, um... zucchini bread.

17:39.902 --> 17:42.572
It's super fire.
Took me two days to perfect it.

17:42.604 --> 17:43.906
Well, thank you, man.

17:43.940 --> 17:46.176
That's... real nice of you.

17:46.209 --> 17:47.844
Try it, bro. Go on.

17:47.876 --> 17:50.513
Taste it. Get in there.

17:50.546 --> 17:52.348
All right.

17:58.921 --> 18:00.156
- Damn.
- Right?

18:00.190 --> 18:01.825
- That's good.
- I know.

18:01.857 --> 18:03.025
When I was going through
my rough moments,

18:03.058 --> 18:04.927
someone taught me
to always look for happiness

18:04.960 --> 18:06.300
- in the little things.
- Mm-hmm.

18:06.325 --> 18:08.531
So, next time you find yourself

18:08.565 --> 18:11.368
marinating in a hopeless, grim road,

18:11.401 --> 18:13.836
just think about the little things.

18:13.870 --> 18:15.939
Do you think that what happened
the other night was me?

18:16.873 --> 18:18.341
Uh, yeah.

18:18.373 --> 18:20.911
They said some guy with weird
hair at Hawkins tried to end it.

18:20.943 --> 18:22.778
No, man! That was P.J.

18:22.812 --> 18:24.381
And nobody tried to end anything.

18:24.413 --> 18:26.083
- P.J.?
- Yeah.

18:26.115 --> 18:28.017
- That's fire.
- P.J... P.J...

18:28.050 --> 18:30.686
Ohh, wow, P.J.!

18:30.719 --> 18:32.184
That makes so much more sense.

18:32.209 --> 18:34.044
No wonder nobody in the group
was talking about it.

18:34.069 --> 18:34.988
Yeah.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.747
I'm actually working
on a little something

18:36.772 --> 18:38.215
to help the whole situation.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.308
Check her out.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.702
Organizing a fundraiser to help get

18:40.736 --> 18:42.639
better mental health support
for the students here.

18:42.671 --> 18:45.475
Wow. That's...

18:45.508 --> 18:46.542
That's major.

18:46.575 --> 18:48.544
- Yeah.
- Well, you know,

18:48.576 --> 18:49.912
if you need help with anything,
you know,

18:49.944 --> 18:52.814
a little, uh, gluten-free
zucchini bread to auction off...

18:52.847 --> 18:54.549
...hit me up.

18:59.788 --> 19:02.090
<i>So, I had no idea if my presentation</i>

19:02.123 --> 19:03.425
<i>impressed the board</i>

19:03.459 --> 19:05.628
<i>or just confused them into saying "yes".</i>

19:05.661 --> 19:08.264
<i>But later that night, I was informed...</i>

19:08.296 --> 19:10.999
Your girl is officially declared.

19:11.033 --> 19:13.569
The Sociology of Fashion!

19:13.602 --> 19:14.970
Now I just got to find my crew

19:15.004 --> 19:16.806
so we can go kill this Fundie Run.

19:16.838 --> 19:18.907
That's right. Murder in a tutu!

19:36.292 --> 19:38.861
<i>As I ran with my girls, I realized</i>

19:38.893 --> 19:41.296
<i>that, despite
all the stress and pressure,</i>

19:41.329 --> 19:43.450
<i>college really</i> is <i> bliss,</i>

19:43.475 --> 19:45.701
<i>paradise, utopia.</i>

19:45.735 --> 19:47.937
<i>And, sure, there were challenges.</i>

19:47.969 --> 19:50.105
<i>But once you push past them,</i>

19:50.139 --> 19:51.873
<i>it really is amazing.</i>

19:54.977 --> 19:56.112
- Oh!
- Oh!

20:00.850 --> 20:04.654
<i>Until the next challenge
inevitably presented itself.</i>

20:04.687 --> 20:08.123
Yeah, hi. Uh, we need... we need
a campus medic immediately.

20:08.156 --> 20:09.591
My friend just fell.

20:12.517 --> 20:15.464
All right. Black minds, everybody.

20:15.498 --> 20:17.834
Black minds, my man. Pay attention.

20:17.866 --> 20:19.534
They don't want you to know.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.720
Oh-ho, not on my watch!

20:26.745 --> 20:28.210
I'm coming! Hold on!

20:31.380 --> 20:32.715
Ohh.

20:32.748 --> 20:34.750
You guys are about
to <i> make</i> life, not end it.

20:34.784 --> 20:36.085
Okay. Well, continue.

20:36.117 --> 20:37.753
There's way too many candles
in here, though.

20:37.787 --> 20:39.087
It's a fire hazard. So just...

20:39.121 --> 20:40.818
...keep that in mind.

20:40.843 --> 20:42.295
All right. Thank you.
