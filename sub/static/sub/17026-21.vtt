Previously, on "ER.."

00:05.973 --> 00:07.175
I'll be with you in a second!

00:07.241 --> 00:08.442
I found a baby.
I think it's dying.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.710
I'm gonna need
to appoint someone

00:09.777 --> 00:10.943
from the hospital staff

00:11.011 --> 00:12.146
to be his protective custodian

00:12.213 --> 00:13.381
while he's in here.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.216
You up for it?

00:15.283 --> 00:17.185
So many times in my life

00:17.251 --> 00:19.987
I've-I've failed
to take a chance.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.222
Don't worry, Neela, I'm not here

00:21.289 --> 00:22.690
to try and convince you to stay.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.658
If you can handle
being with a guy

00:24.725 --> 00:25.793
who gets stuck by needles

00:25.859 --> 00:27.295
and kicked by patients and..

00:27.361 --> 00:28.429
...takes an occasional slug

00:28.496 --> 00:31.099
of radiation to his cajones..

00:31.165 --> 00:32.700
...well, then, I can
certainly stomach

00:32.766 --> 00:34.302
some occasional gunfire.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.310
I got a meeting at 9:00.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.577
Maybe the weekend
would be better.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.180
Well, he's getting
discharged tomorrow.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.315
You're about to
start a shift.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.183
I can get someone to cover.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.618
Look, it's okay
to be nervous.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.720
We don't know anything
about this baby.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.054
Most times, you don't.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.489
He seems pretty perfect
right now.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.057
I'd rather do this
when we can spend

00:57.125 --> 00:58.392
some real time with him.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.161
Well, let's just start
with five minutes

01:00.228 --> 01:01.962
and take it from there.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.364
- Good morning.
- Yes, it is.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.733
I will pick you up at 8:30.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.169
- What should I wear?
- Something fancy.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.903
- I hate surprises.
- Okay, okay.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.038
It involves fine dining

01:11.105 --> 01:12.273
and some other things.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.408
- Archie!
- It's going to be a big night.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.546
Big night?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.548
- Popping the question?
- What, are you crazy?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.082
We're still
in the honeymoon phase.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.118
A year from now,
we could hate each other's guts.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.319
And I thought
romance was dead.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.387
No, the big surprise

01:26.454 --> 01:27.621
is I have been studying

01:27.688 --> 01:29.357
an instructional
DVD for two weeks.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.492
Morris, what happens in your
bedroom stays in your bedroom.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.093
I'm taking her salsa dancing.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.962
She's Puerto Rican,
it's in her blood

01:35.028 --> 01:36.364
and I have to work on it.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.965
- Yes, you do.
- Dr. Morris.

01:38.031 --> 01:38.999
You should be
dressed for work

01:39.066 --> 01:40.168
before you start your shift.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.302
No, no, I'm not on today.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.070
I'm volunteering
at Camp Del Corazon.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.772
- Is that today?
- Camp del what?

01:44.838 --> 01:47.074
Yeah, it's a program for kids
who have had open heart surgery.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.676
Kids with heart disease
running around?

01:48.742 --> 01:51.212
Yeah, so we should get
some business down here.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.413
No, it's nothing too strenuous.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.114
Arts and crafts, face-painting

01:54.182 --> 01:55.216
maybe a little charades.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.418
Excuse me, Cate. Ca-can we..

01:57.485 --> 01:59.387
I-I'm gonna go upstairs
and check on--

01:59.453 --> 02:01.589
Felix Kirsh, found
unconscious in Lincoln Park.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.524
Scalp hematoma and blood
from his right ear.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.426
- Trauma rooms are full.
- Curtain two.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.428
Started seizing as we pulled up.
Gave four of Ativan.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.363
Alright, draw up another two.
Did he fall?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.531
Might've been mugged.
Police were there.

02:10.598 --> 02:11.732
We've got to consider cardiac

02:11.799 --> 02:14.568
'metabolic, and
toxicologic etiologies.'

02:14.635 --> 02:16.270
Alright, that's more like it.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.138
Um, I'll-I'll
just start 'em off.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.940
(Chuny)
'Ready? One, two, three.'

02:20.007 --> 02:21.642
Now.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.944
Felix, open your eyes,
look at me, Felix.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.247
He's postictal,
did you call his parents?

02:26.314 --> 02:27.748
- Didn't have time for that.
- Here's his ID.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.082
Ruptured his eardrum.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.452
I can come back after work.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.120
Pupils equal and reactive.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.422
Since you got
everything under control

02:34.488 --> 02:35.789
I'm going to pediatrics
for a few minutes.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.891
Alright, gram of Dilantin
over 20.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.196
(Cate)
'How are you
doing today, hmm?'

02:42.263 --> 02:44.765
Did you get
a good night's sleep?

02:44.832 --> 02:47.134
Did you, did you?

02:47.201 --> 02:49.370
He likes the rocker.

02:49.437 --> 02:52.039
I want you to meet someone.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.207
I want you
to meet my husband.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.042
- His name's Russell.
- Hello.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.610
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.647
[baby cooing]

03:02.250 --> 03:04.117
Settle down, little man.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.254
Settle down, settle down.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.821
You know, I think he
seemed happier with you.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.023
Y-y-you want to take..

03:10.090 --> 03:12.426
Oh, n-n-no, no need to fuss.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.127
Russell's a good guy.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.230
That's better.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.165
That's better, yeah.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.000
He's tracking objects
with his eyes.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.070
- 'And he smiles at people.'
- 'Yes, you do.'

03:23.136 --> 03:25.639
Yeah, the developmental
milestones of a two-month-old.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.577
Oh, you're a very advanced
young man.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.811
Uh-huh.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.746
[laughing]

03:33.547 --> 03:35.215
My protective custodianship

03:35.283 --> 03:37.251
is over when he's discharged.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.419
Uh-huh.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.120
If we're serious about adopting

03:40.187 --> 03:41.755
we have to take
a state certified

03:41.822 --> 03:44.024
parenting class.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.859
When do we start, huh?

03:50.130 --> 03:51.399
Let's start now.

to see The Big Kahuna.

- Hey, Kahuna, this is Archie.
- 'Okay'.

to meeting you.

* Blame it on the boogie *

04:56.897 --> 04:59.132
* Don't you blame it
on the sunshine.. *

04:59.199 --> 05:00.401
You know, on a second thought

05:00.468 --> 05:02.770
see that kid over there?
His name is Logan.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.672
'See if you can
get him to join us.'

- Okay, alright.
- Yeah.

I never cared much for,

No.

What do you.. What do you like?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.674
'You're wasting your time'

05:40.741 --> 05:43.377
because I don't want
to be here, okay?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.745
My parents made me come.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.281
Have you been
out of the country?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.718
Uh, two months ago,
Machu Picchu.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.153
Uh, I might not need
a scalpel then.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.889
- Kayson called about a biopsy.
- Yeah, I'll call him back.

05:55.956 --> 05:56.990
He faxed the report.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.598
Thanks.

Hey, doc. Do I need
a tetanus shot?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.506

more than five years, yeah.

Oh, my god.

Botfly larvae, it's, uh,
endemic to South America.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.023
Are the-are they taking
over my body?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.593
The fly lays eggs on you

06:32.660 --> 06:34.428
and the larvae burrows
under the skin.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.898
You'd know if there's any more.
I'll be back.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.501
- Your bookshelves are empty.
- 'You need some artwork.'

06:40.568 --> 06:41.735
(Neela)
'Yeah, I'm still in boxes.'

06:41.802 --> 06:42.970
'The way they're working me'

Hey, look, Simon's here.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.012
Hey, there,
this is my new home.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.080
That's impressive.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.683
Oh, check this out.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.618
(Tony)
'Wow, assistant
professor of surgery.'

06:57.685 --> 06:59.820
We get residents from Tulane.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.355
So, I do have
a faculty position.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.057
Well, I'll be sure
to tell Dubenko.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.460
I brought you your stuff
you wanted from home.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.361
- Who are you talking to?
- County.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.363
Oh, yeah? Hey, guys.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.700
- Hi, Ray.
- Ray.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.670
Um, I'm gonna be late
for the OR.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.938
I just wanted to check in.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.240
- Call anytime.
- Yeah, we miss you.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.709
Take care.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.743
Bye.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.879
[cheering]

07:29.416 --> 07:30.751
Yeah!

07:30.818 --> 07:32.452
Okay, so the rule
of the friendship bracelet

07:32.520 --> 07:34.154
is that you can't keep it
for yourself.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.524
You have to give it
to someone really special.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.026
Who are you giving
yours to, Xena?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.328
I haven't decided yet.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.097
You can give it to your husband.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.633
I don't have one of those.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.967
Do you have a boyfriend?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.201
Not right now.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.638
Do you?

07:51.539 --> 07:53.106
A boyfriend?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.374
Yeah, right.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.408
Why not?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.578
Guys tend to avoid me.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.747
What? Come on.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.515
You're pretty
and you're smart.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.751
I'm a freak with scars
and a bad heart.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.418
I had a cardiac arrest
in math class

08:05.485 --> 08:06.453
and the paramedics had to came

08:06.520 --> 08:07.788
'and give me CPR.'

08:07.855 --> 08:10.023
It's kind of a buzzkill
to the guys.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.526
That and my internal
defibrillator.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.261
What's your heart defect?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.563
Tetralogy of Fallot.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.031
- So, you had a BT shunt?
- Mm-hmm.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.433
I had hypo plastic
left heart syndrome.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.169
'I needed a Norwood, Glenn'

08:22.235 --> 08:23.871
'and Fontan before
my transplants.'

about camp

08:25.573 --> 08:27.007
is that we all fit in.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.342
You don't have
to worry about your scar.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.178
Just be yourself and go crazy.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.784
(male #1)
'Put it up, put it up.'

08:42.990 --> 08:44.892
- Whoo!
- 'Nice shot, nice shot.'

08:44.958 --> 08:46.326
[panting]

08:46.393 --> 08:47.895
What's up, Xena?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.631
Oh, just a little
arts and crafts.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.799
Oh, I got to cool down.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.166
Hey, Emily, you wanna, you wanna

08:53.233 --> 08:54.735
to check out the slime slide?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.604
Um, I, uh, have to get

08:56.670 --> 08:58.538
something from my backpack.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.973
Is she not suppose to exercise?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.675
No, she's in good shape,
it's just this is her

09:01.742 --> 09:03.611
first time at camp
and her parents really don't

09:03.677 --> 09:04.845
let her do very much.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.718
Thread to 40 centimeters.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.720
Taking needle out, opsite.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.055
We'll titrate to 10cc's an hour.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.490
You did great, Felix.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.827
This is Dr. Kirsh, Felix's dad.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.429
Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.463
I'm Dr. Banfield.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.698
'We spoke.'

09:26.466 --> 09:27.434
Hey, there.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.669
Hey.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.403
Are you a physician?

09:30.470 --> 09:31.805
No, physics professor.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.642
At the world famous
Enrico Fermi Institute.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.143
Are you okay?

09:36.209 --> 09:37.544
'How'd you hit
your head so hard?'

09:37.611 --> 09:39.179
I don't remember.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.814
We're trying to
figure out if he fell

09:40.881 --> 09:42.315
or if something made him faint.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.817
(Kirsch)
'You know, I've
heard that, uh..'

09:43.884 --> 09:44.852
sometimes, sleep deprivation

09:44.918 --> 09:46.086
can lead to seizures.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.387
It can.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.421
'He was up all last week'

09:48.488 --> 09:50.023
burning the midnight oil

09:50.090 --> 09:52.492
but he aced all his midterms.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.761
Indeed, I did.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.731
You wanna have a seat?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.266
Thank you.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.768
(Cate)
'Yeah, it could be a while'

10:00.834 --> 10:02.235
'before they take him upstairs.'

10:02.302 --> 10:05.205
"How much of human life
is lost in waiting?"

10:06.573 --> 10:07.841
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.944
We'll be right back.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.279
Okay if I take him
to the curtains?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.314
Uh, that'll be fine.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.017
Can you imagine having
a dad like that?

10:17.084 --> 10:17.851
I like him.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.687
He's concerned, devoted.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.221
Think about the pressure
that kid's under.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.091
Fits the profile,
acting out, doing drugs.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.159
Well, check it out,
but I doubt it.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.428
I'll have psych come
down for an assessment.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.263
Knock yourself out.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.965
Dr. Banfield.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.433
There's someone here
to see you.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.802
Mm, okay.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.403
(Frank)
'That's Megan.'

10:40.040 --> 10:42.375
I dropped off a baby
a couple of weeks ago.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.777
I remember.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.212
I can't sleep at night.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.815
The baby is doing fine.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.883
- He is?
- Yes.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.819
He's well taken care of.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.989
Are you alright?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.861
No. No.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.562
I made a mistake,
I want him back.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.864
I wanna keep him.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.407
My mom says she can help.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.411
And I'll be getting a check
from the state

11:18.478 --> 11:20.513
SO, we'll be okay.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.482
What about high school?

11:22.549 --> 11:23.951
I can go back.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.822
You know, being a mom
isn't so easy.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.025
I see girls younger
than me doing it.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.796
So, you're sure about this?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.570
Okay, I'll talk
to our social worker

11:43.636 --> 11:46.339
but, uh, it might be a while.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.374
I'll wait.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.281
Megan.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.483
You know..

11:56.549 --> 11:57.717
You just seem a little confused.

11:57.785 --> 11:58.786
Are you sure you don't want

11:58.852 --> 12:00.720
to think about this some more?

12:00.788 --> 12:02.089
I already have.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.059
I made a bad decision and..

12:07.761 --> 12:09.029
I just want to do what's right.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.335
Alright, so there's a tear
in the dura mater.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.503
The outermost, toughest

12:16.569 --> 12:19.306
of the three meninges
covering the brain.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.307
AP Biology.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.608
Okay, well,
you're gonna be on bed rest

12:21.674 --> 12:23.276
for about five days
till it heals.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.945
I cancelled all my appointments
but I've got

12:25.012 --> 12:26.980
a couple of classes,
okay if I'm back at six?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.216
- No problem.
- I'm not going anywhere.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.884
Alright.

12:30.951 --> 12:31.919
Cell phone's on.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.353
See you, kiddo.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.790
Okay, what do you remember
about this morning?

12:36.857 --> 12:39.259
I cut through the park
on my way to school.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.862
Sometimes, I jump
over these rocks.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.263
I guess I slipped.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.331
Anything else?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.435
So, tell me, how does a freshman

12:48.501 --> 12:50.470
end up in AP Biology?

12:50.537 --> 12:51.805
All my classes are AP.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.341
Sounds like a lot of stress.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.475
Not really.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.977
Have you been sad lately?

12:58.545 --> 12:59.980
Alex on line two.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.548
- He says it's important.
- Alright.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.649
You know, after a concussion

13:02.715 --> 13:03.884
as time goes by you can start

13:03.951 --> 13:04.985
to remember more so make sure

13:05.052 --> 13:06.286
to tell me if that happens.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.055
I got something to tell you
when you're done.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.089
Alright.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.658
Hello.

13:11.724 --> 13:12.692
What do you mean it doesn't fit?

13:12.759 --> 13:13.861
I specifically ordered

13:13.927 --> 13:15.963
for a '65 dashboard.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.530
- How was camp?
- Amazing.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.032
- I wish I could stay all day.
- Alright.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.001
I'll call
for a return authorization.

13:21.068 --> 13:24.371
No, they were not supposed
to send a six-CD changer.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.840
Okay, okay, bye.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.175
Getting a new stereo?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.643
No, actually.
My-my car got broken into.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.879
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.949
Oh, PD has some new info.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.151
Witnesses saw a fight
in Lincoln Park, this morning

13:38.218 --> 13:40.620
where they found your kid,
at least four teenagers

13:40.687 --> 13:42.589
grabbing and shoving each other.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.857
- Frank?
- Thanks.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.358
What's Neela doing
on your computer?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.861
It's a screen shot.
You missed her video chat.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.996
Oh, how is she?

13:49.062 --> 13:50.030
Never thought she'd be happy

13:50.097 --> 13:51.098
in Louisiana, but I was wrong.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.000
She looks good, she sounds good.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.501
I got three new ones to present.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.803
Come on. Why am I the only
attending on the floor?

13:56.870 --> 13:58.071
Good afternoon.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.273
Hedda Lanford,
24 weeks pregnant.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.408
Congratulations.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.143
Complains of left leg pain
and swelling.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.577
It got so bad, I couldn't walk.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.080
- Any shortness of breath?
- No, just the leg.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.681
- They're good vitals.
- Okay, trauma two.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.718
Dr. Brenner, paramedics are
five minutes out with a hot MI.

14:11.784 --> 14:12.920
Okay, call the cath lab

14:12.986 --> 14:14.554
and grab me when they're here.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.390
- Has the baby been moving?
- Mm-hmm, maybe a little less.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.226
But, I could be
imagining things.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.362
Let's get some fetal heart tones
and prep the SonoSite.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.231
- Simon.
- Yeah?

14:24.297 --> 14:26.299
- Want me to take her upstairs?
- What for?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.601
After 20 weeks, we like
to send them to OB.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.737
The baby's viable,
they get better monitoring.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.405
That'd be fine
if she had belly pain.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.641
- They can check out her leg.
- Well, we'll do a better job.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.742
I'm worried about a blood clot

14:35.808 --> 14:37.077
and mom comes first
not the baby.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.112
Alright, then she needs an NST.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.281
- So get a fetal monitor.
- Are you okay?

14:41.348 --> 14:42.715
- Yeah.
- You seem a little--

14:42.782 --> 14:44.584
Look, there's supposed
to be double attending coverage

14:44.651 --> 14:46.819
but I'm looking after
40 patients by myself.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.855
Set up a duplex scan.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.491
Keep going, man.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.960
[bell clanging]

14:53.026 --> 14:54.427
Yeah! Yeah. Good job, kid.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.528
[cheering]

14:55.595 --> 14:56.563
Good job!

14:58.231 --> 15:00.667
Oh, this is pretty cool.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.069
It's a baby wall.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.170
I've been up on one

15:03.236 --> 15:05.638
like, twice that size.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.174
You wanna race me to the top?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.775
I'll give you ten bucks
if you win.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.543
You think you can bribe me?

15:10.610 --> 15:13.246
- That is so pathetic.
- 'No, I can't.'

15:13.313 --> 15:14.982
(Vera)
'It's not as hard
as it looks, really.'

15:15.048 --> 15:16.449
- It's-it's fun, It's..
- I don't want to.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.917
Hey, what's going on?

15:17.985 --> 15:19.452
She's afraid to try.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.421
You know what?

15:21.488 --> 15:23.623
Have you ever had a dream
where you were flying?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.027
What was it like?

15:29.196 --> 15:30.630
Don't look at the ground.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.698
One more step!

15:31.764 --> 15:32.865
No, I'm...you know, I'm

15:32.932 --> 15:33.900
I'm coming down, guys.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.835
No! Keep going.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.870
Okay, I'm gonna..

15:37.937 --> 15:39.906
I'm gonna keep going.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.841
Oh, no!

15:41.908 --> 15:44.477
I don't think I can do this.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.379
[bell clanging]

15:46.446 --> 15:47.480
[cheering]

15:47.547 --> 15:49.282
Yeah!

15:49.349 --> 15:50.984
- You got it!
- 'Two.'

15:51.051 --> 15:52.952
- Three!
- 'You got it!'

15:53.020 --> 15:55.155
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

15:55.222 --> 15:56.823
Good job right there!

15:56.889 --> 15:57.991
You, too.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.392
Hey!

16:01.561 --> 16:02.762
That was awesome.

16:02.829 --> 16:03.997
Oh.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.811
Hey.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.680
Russ, I got some bad news.

16:24.451 --> 16:28.255
Definite DVT, there's a large
blood clot in the thigh.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.289
How does that happen?

16:29.356 --> 16:30.490
As the uterus grows

16:30.557 --> 16:32.159
it compresses the pelvic veins.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.960
Pregnancy makes
the blood more coagulable.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.162
So, we need to treat you

16:35.228 --> 16:37.130
with a blood thinner
called heparin.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.165
Is that safe for the baby?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.466
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.034
It took us three years
to get pregnant.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.402
Well, heparin doesn't cross
the placenta.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.003
What if you
don't give it to me?

16:45.872 --> 16:47.074
Well, a piece of the blood clot

16:47.140 --> 16:48.108
could break off

16:48.175 --> 16:49.376
and travel to your lungs.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.943
It's called a
pulmonary embolism.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.080
And you can die from that.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.282
Um, my brother-in-law's an OB.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.016
Do you mind if we
discuss this with him?

16:57.084 --> 16:58.251
That's a good idea.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.619
Look, I think
we're wasting valuable time.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.454
This is a no-brainer.
Heparin's safe.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.656
It'll save your life.
It'll save your baby's life.

17:03.723 --> 17:07.627
So, let's prep
a 5,000 unit bolus, please.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.661
Excuse me.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.865
Hey? Hey!

17:12.932 --> 17:14.401
What is their problem?

17:14.467 --> 17:15.568
They just need a little time.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.470
Well, Banfield can deal
with them

17:17.537 --> 17:19.606
'cause I'm supposed
to go over to this heart camp.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.842
Oh, well, they're going to
love you with that attitude.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.310
Well, maybe I won't go.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.346
Look, I know it's a hard time.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.649
It'll get better.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.983
What are you talking about?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.685
Neela.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.154
Neela, look, Sam

17:34.221 --> 17:35.955
tell your gossip circle
not to worry.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.291
I've moved on,
and I'm fine, okay?

17:42.929 --> 17:44.197
You really need me here?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.532
You're my designated runner.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.566
Okay.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.602
Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:51.404 --> 17:52.605
(Archie)
'Okay, okay.'

17:52.672 --> 17:54.541
(The Big Kahuna)
'Alright, two down.'

17:54.607 --> 17:55.642
'Bases loaded.'

17:55.708 --> 17:56.676
Bring me home, baby.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.077
'Bring me home, Vera.'

17:58.845 --> 17:59.812
Yeah!

17:59.879 --> 18:00.947
[indistinct]

18:01.013 --> 18:03.950
Vera, pour it on faster!

18:04.016 --> 18:06.186
We can get a grand slam.
Bring it home!

18:08.588 --> 18:09.556
[grunts]

18:10.657 --> 18:12.559
(The Big Kahuna)
'What happened?'

18:12.625 --> 18:15.027
- Okay.
- What's going on, honey?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.496
My defibrillator's firing.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.864
Let me check the carotid.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.866
[grunts]

18:19.932 --> 18:21.134
I think she's in V-tach.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.370
[indistinct chatter]

18:25.037 --> 18:26.906
(Cate)
'And I'll do a Hennepin
with him sitting up.'

18:26.973 --> 18:29.075
Back in the socket.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.443
Alright, immobilizer

18:30.510 --> 18:32.312
and a post-reduction film.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.580
When we lived in San Diego

18:33.646 --> 18:35.782
I saw a surfer throw
his shoulder out.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.284
San Diego's nice.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.152
We were there for
about two years.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.820
Oh, how long
have you lived here?

18:40.887 --> 18:41.854
Since September.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.393
- Are you having any eye pain?
- Uh-uh.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.894
Look, Archie,
I know I volunteered

18:47.960 --> 18:49.662
but if you've got
enough help, then I--

18:49.729 --> 18:51.164
No, we're completely
short-staffed now.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.199
You need to get over there.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.666
This is so not necessary.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.702
Well, good, 'cause
it's not gonna take very long.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.271
- ICD discharge.
- You want a 12 lead?

18:58.338 --> 18:59.939
I gotta grab the programmer.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.174
We're gonna interrogate.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.511
- Who is that?
- The Big Kahuna.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.779
Chief of pediatric
cardiology at Rush.

19:06.846 --> 19:07.914
'He runs the camp.'

19:07.980 --> 19:09.249
Normal sinus, 84.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.117
Okay, send Lytes and a troponin.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.952
Hey, I'm Vera.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.521
Felix, what happened?

19:14.587 --> 19:17.490
I have a defibrillator
in my chest.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.458
Cool.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.527
I think it shocked me
by accident.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.628
Did it hurt?

19:21.694 --> 19:22.795
'A little.'

19:22.862 --> 19:24.264
Like a horse kicked me.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.098
Hey, Rojo, Xena, um,
can you call upstairs

19:26.165 --> 19:27.133
and tell them I'm alright?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.269
Rojo? Xena?

19:31.204 --> 19:33.172
Okay, so Vera says she's fine

19:33.240 --> 19:34.907
and she'll be back really soon.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.410
[cheering]

19:37.477 --> 19:38.478
(Chuny)
'You ready?'

19:38.545 --> 19:40.280
Okay, so what we have to do is

19:40.347 --> 19:42.815
we all have to get
from this side to the other side

19:42.882 --> 19:45.352
without going through
the same hole twice.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.686
Can I go first?

19:46.753 --> 19:47.720
Sure, go ahead.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.958
[cheering]

19:52.024 --> 19:54.361
Wow, it's like cirque du soleil.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.431
Good job!

19:59.932 --> 20:01.301
Don't touch the web.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.736
Hey.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.104
what?

20:05.171 --> 20:07.039
Well, if everyone goes
through the web

20:07.106 --> 20:10.610
- It kind of builds a team.
- That's stupid.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.912
He doesn't have to do it
if he doesn't want to.

20:12.979 --> 20:13.980
It would mean a lot to the kids

20:14.046 --> 20:15.682
if you'd join in.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.050
It wouldn't mean a lot to me.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.452
Why don't you do it for them?

20:22.755 --> 20:24.857
You really want me
to go to the other side?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.058
Yeah.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.328
[yelling]

20:32.098 --> 20:33.300
I did it.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.234
'Look at me. I'm on
the other side.'

20:35.968 --> 20:37.437
Bingo.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.372
That'll tell you
if it was V-tach?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.341
This will tell us everything.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.313
Oh.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.114
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.882
Felix is getting a bed at 7:00.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.718
- How's your headache?
- I think it's better.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.753
(Vera)
'So, how'd you get
a name like Felix?'

20:53.820 --> 20:55.087
After Felix Bloch.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.489
He was a physicist who won

20:56.556 --> 20:59.191
the Nobel Prize
for nuclear magnetic resonance.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.927
- Like in MRI scans.
- 'Yeah.'

21:00.993 --> 21:02.261
His work led to that.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.463
He was a giant.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.264
Studied with Heisenberg
and Schrodinger.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.367
Schrodinger had a cat.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.668
You know about that?

21:08.735 --> 21:10.537
He didn't actually have a cat.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.838
It was like
a thought experiment.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.540
Uh, the cat in the box
is either alive

21:13.606 --> 21:15.742
or dead depending
on a random event.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.243
Okay, I am completely confused.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.578
That makes two of us.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.879
(The Big Kahuna)
'Great news.'

21:19.946 --> 21:21.247
It was just sinus tach.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.683
When you ran, your pulse
rate went up to 180.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.452
That means she can go back?

21:25.518 --> 21:28.388
Well, she got shocked six times

21:28.455 --> 21:30.490
so I think we got
to keep you in the hospital.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.624
I'm not getting admitted.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.959
- 'Not during camp.'
- Honey.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.429
This thing zaps you
at a heart rate of 160.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.630
So, if you exert yourself
at all--

21:37.697 --> 21:39.366
Why don't you set it higher?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.103
That's a good idea.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.738
'We could do that.'

21:45.805 --> 21:47.039
'Okay.'

21:47.106 --> 21:48.941
Okay, no shocks..

21:49.008 --> 21:51.043
until 200.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.814
But only till after
the dance, alright?

21:54.881 --> 21:55.848
'Huh?'

21:55.915 --> 21:56.716
All right.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.385
Two weeks later,
and she can just

21:58.451 --> 22:00.119
walk in the door
like nothing happened?

22:00.186 --> 22:01.354
That's what she did.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.955
'There must be some kind
of a time limit.'

22:03.022 --> 22:04.090
There isn't.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.525
She's in high school.

22:05.592 --> 22:06.893
We're in a much better position
to care for that baby.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.195
- That isn't the issue.
- We have resources.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.730
We have a home.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.865
We have maturity. Doesn't
that count for something?

22:12.932 --> 22:13.700
She's his mother.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.368
That counts more than anything.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.703
'It's not a done deal.'

22:16.769 --> 22:18.337
The case worker
still has to talk

22:18.405 --> 22:20.006
to the mom and the grandmother.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.241
It will take a week
for the determination.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.910
You let me know how that goes.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.545
Russ, come on.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.014
You know the system.

22:29.215 --> 22:30.617
Maybe there's
something else to do.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.553
We keep working,
we keep praying, we keep going.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.588
I've been doing that
for seven years.

22:37.857 --> 22:38.825
There you go.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.159
(Archie)
'They really need me'

22:40.226 --> 22:41.561
and I have to cancel tonight.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.130
Well, you can come down here.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.934
You would? Really?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.268
Do you.. Do you
own a sleeping bag?

22:49.335 --> 22:50.570
It was nice to meet you.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.071
Maybe I'll see you around?

22:52.138 --> 22:53.873
Yeah.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.075
We could take Felix
to the dance.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.611
It's only for kids who've
had open-heart surgery.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.947
- He has an open skull fracture.
- That's close.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.382
Not to mention a catheter
in his spinal column.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.151
He has to stay on bed rest.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.519
Lemme see what I can do.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.488
So, how's it going in here?

23:09.622 --> 23:11.591
(Felix)
'Okay.'

23:11.658 --> 23:13.560
Dr. Gates, would you
take a seat.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.597
I-I get very frustrated
because I like to get

23:17.664 --> 23:19.198
to the bottom of things.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.167
I need to know the truth.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.370
Did you know Felix's parents
have to move every year or two?

23:24.437 --> 23:25.605
Academic careers.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.374
New universities.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.177
Doesn't give you much
chance to put down roots

23:32.344 --> 23:33.513
'make friends.'

23:33.580 --> 23:34.981
When you feel like an outsider

23:35.047 --> 23:38.551
sometimes you fall in with kids
who do dangerous things.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.353
- Like drugs.
- My urine test was negative.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.122
You have Tardieu spots.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.292
'Little red dots
near your eyes.'

23:46.358 --> 23:47.894
'Now, maybe you don't remember'

23:47.960 --> 23:50.597
but it can happen when someone
tries to choke you.

23:52.899 --> 23:53.866
Felix?

23:56.302 --> 23:57.470
Felix?

24:01.474 --> 24:03.810
Did someone grab you
around the neck?

24:09.516 --> 24:10.717
Not the neck.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.752
The chest.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.524
It's called
suffocation roulette.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.527
You hold your breath
and someone squeezes

24:20.593 --> 24:21.828
you from behind.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.431
The first one to pass out loses.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.133
Kids die from playing that game.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.835
Or get brain damage.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.137
You're too smart a kid
to be doing that.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.842
They're my friends.

24:36.676 --> 24:37.910
(Samantha)
'Dr. Banfield.'

24:37.977 --> 24:39.211
We need you in Trauma Two
right away.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.913
[intense music]

24:40.980 --> 24:43.082
My pregnant DVT lady
has sudden onset chest pain.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.684
- She's on heparin?
- For the past hour.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.619
- What's her pressure?
- 110/65.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.420
I already did the EKG.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.589
[groaning]

24:49.656 --> 24:50.890
Alright, tell me
about your pain.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.559
Hurts when I take a breath.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.393
Could a blood clot
have gone to her lung?

24:54.460 --> 24:55.562
I would say yes.

24:55.628 --> 24:56.663
There's a new right axis

24:56.729 --> 24:58.497
deviation and S-one Q-three.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.532
But she's on heparin.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.600
Well, it's not a perfect drug.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.668
What do we do now?

25:01.734 --> 25:03.135
Okay, we could try TPA.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.937
It's a powerful
clot-busting medicine.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.706
If it works,
she's back to normal

25:06.773 --> 25:08.541
with only a one percent
risk of death.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.409
What about the baby?

25:10.476 --> 25:11.778
(Cate)
'There are no good studies.'

25:11.844 --> 25:13.079
TPA definitely carries

25:13.145 --> 25:15.514
a risk of miscarriage
or fetal death.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.816
How big of a risk?

25:16.883 --> 25:19.652
- Ten percent, maybe more.
- 'Oh, God.'

25:19.719 --> 25:21.888
What about a vena cava filter?

25:21.954 --> 25:25.692
If we put a filter
in your main vein here

25:25.758 --> 25:26.893
'we could prevent future clots'

25:26.959 --> 25:28.194
'from traveling to your lung'

25:28.260 --> 25:29.596
but it takes time.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.898
We...we don't wanna
hurt the baby.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.133
What would you do?

25:39.505 --> 25:40.773
I don't care.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.275
I don't care if we have
to stay in here all day.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.777
Yeah, me, neither.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.213
They keep bugging me
to play their stupid games.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.280
Well, they don't get it.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.616
They don't understand.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.720
Hey, we could..
We could flush some

25:53.786 --> 25:54.987
tennis balls down the toilets.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.356
That would back
them up for days.

25:57.423 --> 26:01.093
Or.. I know where
there's some spray paint.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.396
We could tag, camp sucks

26:04.463 --> 26:05.598
all over the walls of the gym.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.866
Huh?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.300
Or we can pull some fire alarms

26:08.367 --> 26:10.703
make 'em evacuate all
the patients from the hospital.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.008
Or, you know, we can..

26:16.075 --> 26:18.878
We can just sit here
and...and do nothing.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.215
You think I'm being a jerk.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.386
No, I think that you're
not letting yourself

26:27.453 --> 26:28.821
have a good time.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.758
It's not a good time..

26:32.625 --> 26:34.360
...because Sean's not here.

26:38.030 --> 26:38.998
Sean?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.402
I met him in September.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.471
We were in for heart caths.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.540
We both had truncus arteriosus.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.242
You know what that is?

26:50.309 --> 26:51.277
Yeah.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.580
Ever since we were babies

26:54.647 --> 26:55.948
we had the same operations

26:56.015 --> 26:57.750
and were on the same meds.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.120
He had never been to camp.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.490
I kept telling him
how great it was.

27:04.556 --> 27:05.524
'We made plans.'

27:05.591 --> 27:07.259
We talked and texted every day.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.230
He thought he could win
the Kahuna's fart contest.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.066
'We were gonna
have so much fun.'

27:17.036 --> 27:18.304
He had to go to surgery
last week

27:18.370 --> 27:19.906
for a conduit replacement.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.342
Died on the table.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.281
Logan, I'm sorry.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.423
(cellphone ringing)

27:42.028 --> 27:42.995
Hello.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.131
'Yeah, I know.. I know.'

27:45.197 --> 27:47.133
I'll.. I'll be
there as soon I can.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.707
Not a good week all around.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.409
What?

28:00.780 --> 28:03.182
A good friend of mine
is in the ICU.

28:04.616 --> 28:05.785
Yeah.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.822
I tried really hard
to get her a heart transplant

28:09.889 --> 28:14.193
but...now she's back
in rejection.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.296
It's pretty bad.

28:19.766 --> 28:20.933
What are you doing here?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.836
Well, I...I stopped by

28:23.903 --> 28:25.805
but she's in a coma.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.309
I've been intubated
like ten times.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.478
When I'm deeply sedated

28:32.544 --> 28:34.613
I can hear everything.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.148
I can even tell
who's in the room.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.352
She'll know if you're there.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.826
Trached a month ago
for myasthenia gravis.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.828
Was bleeding this morning,
opened up at Triage.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.329
It's a tracheo-
innominate fistula

28:50.396 --> 28:51.597
from pressure necrosis.

28:51.663 --> 28:52.865
(Tony)
'Alright, four units of O-neg.'

28:52.932 --> 28:55.067
Have thoracic
surgery hold an OR.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.469
'He's pouring out faster
than we can transfuse.'

28:57.536 --> 28:58.805
Overinflate the trach cuff.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.606
That can tamponade the bleeder.

29:00.672 --> 29:01.673
You want the rapid infuser?

29:01.740 --> 29:02.942
Absolutely.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.377
'Alright, this isn't helping.'

29:05.444 --> 29:06.678
Any more air, and
I'll burst the cuff.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.214
Give me a number four Shiley.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.917
- That's a pediatric size.
- No, wait and see.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.852
(Chuny)
'Hemocue's only 8.2.'

29:18.357 --> 29:20.459
(Cate)
'Okay, now you can put
your finger in the trach hole'

29:20.526 --> 29:22.528
'and compress against
the posterior sternum.'

29:22.594 --> 29:23.996
- Like this?
- 'Well done.'

29:24.063 --> 29:25.597
Now, get your ass up to the OR.

29:25.664 --> 29:27.533
Thank you.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.802
Hey, we took her
to radiology for the filter.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.703
She crashed before they started.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.840
BP 70 palp, tachy to 120.

29:33.906 --> 29:34.941
'We may need to intubate her.'

29:35.007 --> 29:36.408
What's going on?

29:36.475 --> 29:38.144
More than likely,
it's another blood clot.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.678
I think we need
to think about TPA.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.047
(male #2)
'No, we decided
we didn't want it'

29:41.113 --> 29:42.448
we don't wanna hurt the baby.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.782
Things have changed since then.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.451
No...honey, honey..

29:45.517 --> 29:46.685
honey, honey, talk to me.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.154
I...honey, I need
your help here.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.655
Wait, what are you doing?

29:49.721 --> 29:50.722
Wait, wait, wait!

29:50.789 --> 29:51.824
What-what are you doing?

29:51.891 --> 29:54.160
[heavy breathing]

29:58.030 --> 29:58.898
(Cate)
'Baby looks great.'

29:59.665 --> 30:01.467
'Placenta is perfect.'

30:01.533 --> 30:03.936
No sign of bleeding.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.137
Thank you.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.472
And the clot in your lung

30:06.538 --> 30:08.274
has completely dissolved.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.976
[sighs]
For a minute, I thought

30:10.042 --> 30:11.844
I was gonna lose both of you.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.913
We like it when things work out.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.618
Dr. Banfield, you gave
TPA without consent.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.153
Yes, I did.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.256
Well, what if there had
been a bad outcome?

30:24.323 --> 30:26.158
She's young and healthy
and was about to die.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.726
Do I need consent
to shock her heart

30:27.793 --> 30:29.228
if she has cardiac arrest?

30:30.796 --> 30:32.431
I guess you got lucky.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.732
You saved that lady?

30:33.799 --> 30:36.568
Yep...and her baby, too.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.804
Uh, I'll get these to the lab.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.172
You're still here?

30:40.239 --> 30:42.041
The guy with the bleeding neck?

30:42.108 --> 30:43.575
He's okay after surgery.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.478
Is there someplace
we could talk?

30:48.314 --> 30:49.415
In here.

31:03.662 --> 31:04.897
What's on your mind?

31:08.600 --> 31:10.636
I've been thinking
about it, and..

31:12.304 --> 31:14.140
I want him to be proud of me.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.311
Yes.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.449
To do that, though..

31:23.515 --> 31:25.451
..I would wanna make
something of myself.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.921
And I would be somebody who..

31:28.988 --> 31:30.589
Who did something important.

31:32.658 --> 31:33.625
Like you.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.196
Like me?

31:38.064 --> 31:39.498
Make a difference, you know?

31:42.701 --> 31:43.902
That's a good goal.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.209
I don't know if I'd really
be able to do that

31:50.276 --> 31:52.011
if I quit school right now.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.548
Having a kid, it's going
to be really hard.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.419
That's true.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.326
The nurses told me you
were the custodian of the baby?

32:13.232 --> 32:15.167
Does that mean you wanted
to adopt him?

32:21.473 --> 32:24.576
My husband and I
were thinking about it.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.323
I'm just scared
I'll never see him again.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.063
That-that-that doesn't
have to happen.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.734
You can watch him grow up.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.970
Get to know him,
be a part of his life.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.272
It's..

32:54.840 --> 32:57.043
...called an open adoption.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.747
How do we do that?

33:05.551 --> 33:07.886
If-if we all agree

33:07.953 --> 33:09.321
we can work it out.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.396
[sighs]

33:22.934 --> 33:25.737
[instrumental music]

33:29.208 --> 33:31.009
What is taking so long?

33:31.077 --> 33:32.411
(Vera)
'Uh, give us two minutes.'

33:32.478 --> 33:34.146
I'm timing you.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.247
Tony, we're on next.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.382
We didn't even do a sound check.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.649
(Vera)
'Just start without us.'

33:38.584 --> 33:40.252
Go in, I'll wait.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.720
(Claudia)
'Archie!'

33:41.787 --> 33:42.788
Hey!

33:42.854 --> 33:44.090
I am so glad you're here!

33:45.491 --> 33:47.393
His name is Rojo.
Who are you?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.961
Uh, this is my friend, Claudia.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.930
Do you have a scar?

33:51.997 --> 33:54.766
A big one.
From here to here.

33:54.833 --> 33:55.801
What do you think?

33:57.002 --> 33:58.304
Hey, beautiful!

33:58.370 --> 33:59.671
(Tony)
'Looking good there, Felix.'

33:59.738 --> 34:02.040
- Good to be the king.
- Alright, let's go!

34:02.108 --> 34:04.710
[cheering]

34:09.848 --> 34:12.751
[instrumental music]

34:37.309 --> 34:38.710
(Archie over PA)
'Hello? Is this thing on?'

34:38.777 --> 34:40.512
Alright, hello, Chicago!

34:40.579 --> 34:41.780
[cheering]

34:41.847 --> 34:42.813
Yeah!

34:44.014 --> 34:45.784
Alright, prepare
to be blown away.

34:46.784 --> 34:47.753
[cheering]

34:47.819 --> 34:48.786
Here we go!

34:48.853 --> 34:49.821
[instrumental music]

34:49.888 --> 34:51.223
I have one question.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.924
How you feelin' out there?

34:52.991 --> 34:54.159
[cheering]

34:55.293 --> 34:56.995
(Archie)
'I can't hear you!'

34:57.062 --> 34:59.097
I said, how you feelin'?!

34:59.165 --> 35:01.933
[cheering]

35:02.000 --> 35:03.034
Hey, Rojo

35:03.101 --> 35:04.703
how do you feel?

35:04.770 --> 35:05.737
[instrumental music]

35:06.505 --> 35:08.640
Wow!

35:08.707 --> 35:09.675
* I feel good *

35:11.477 --> 35:13.512
* I knew that I would now *

35:14.980 --> 35:17.249
* Well I feel good *

35:18.217 --> 35:20.219
* I knew that I would now *

35:21.920 --> 35:22.888
* So good *

35:23.789 --> 35:24.956
* So good *

35:25.023 --> 35:26.258
* I got you *

35:27.526 --> 35:29.695
* Wha I feel nice *

35:31.263 --> 35:33.232
* Like sugar and spice *

35:34.366 --> 35:37.269
* I feel nice *

35:37.336 --> 35:39.671
* Like some sugar and spice *

35:41.373 --> 35:42.541
* So nice *

35:43.242 --> 35:44.676
* So nice *

35:44.743 --> 35:45.777
* I got you *

35:47.979 --> 35:49.147
* Ha *

35:54.220 --> 35:56.154
* Mmm when I hold you *

35:56.222 --> 35:58.290
* In my arms *

35:58.357 --> 36:01.293
* I know I can do no wrong *

36:01.360 --> 36:04.496
* And when I hold
you in my arms *

36:04.563 --> 36:07.233
* My love won't do no harm *

36:07.299 --> 36:09.568
* I feel nice *

36:10.402 --> 36:12.504
* Like sugar and spice *

36:13.872 --> 36:16.942

* Like sugar and spice *

36:20.779 --> 36:21.747

36:22.448 --> 36:23.882
* So nice *

36:23.949 --> 36:25.217
* I got you *

36:32.157 --> 36:34.693
* Ah.. Yeah *

36:38.297 --> 36:40.198
- Dr. Brenner.
- Hey.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.703
What are we stopping
in here for?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.004
Checking on a patient.

36:46.071 --> 36:49.475
* I feel good.. *

36:50.609 --> 36:53.044
You people have some
very unusual therapies.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.746
* Well I feel good *

36:56.081 --> 36:57.182
* Like I knew I would *

36:57.249 --> 36:58.417
They seem quite effective.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.453
* So good *

37:02.153 --> 37:03.355
* So good *

37:03.422 --> 37:04.690
* I got you.. *

37:06.425 --> 37:07.959
* And I feel nice *

37:08.026 --> 37:09.661
[humming]

37:09.728 --> 37:11.730
- Like sugar--
- Alright, shh, shh, shh.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.465
[whispering]
Everybody's sleeping.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.134
This is room 209.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.636
Hey, can I stay
for a little while?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.738
- We'll be quiet.
- You need to get back to camp.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.508
And visiting hours were
over three hours ago.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.775
Come on, you can say good night.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.350
- Good night.
- Night.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.584
(Samantha)
'Good luck, Felix.'

37:36.655 --> 37:39.291
Alright. Hey, give
them some privacy.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.294
Quite a day today, huh?

37:42.961 --> 37:44.663
Yeah.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.433
Oh, thank you for coming
out to dinner with my mom.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.934
You're welcome.

37:49.000 --> 37:49.968
Took the heat off of me.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.770
For some reason she loves you.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.505
Well..

37:53.572 --> 37:55.574
You wanna come to her
colonoscopy with me next week?

37:59.611 --> 38:01.913
Excuse me? Privacy?

38:01.980 --> 38:04.816
[instrumental music]

38:31.377 --> 38:32.644
(Archie)
'Hey!'

38:32.711 --> 38:35.213
- 'Oh-oh!'
- 'Busted..'

38:35.280 --> 38:37.349
Back to your tent.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.284
'Boys stay on the boys' side.'

38:39.351 --> 38:40.519
'Got that?'

38:41.219 --> 38:42.688
[laughing]

38:47.359 --> 38:49.227
Alright, let me know if you hear
anything out there, alright?

38:49.294 --> 38:52.163
- Yes, sir.
- Alright.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.499
- Thirsty?
- No.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.935
- You hungry?
- Ugh.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.837
I had too many s'mores.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.207
Not quite as good as Charlie
Trotter's would have been.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.075
- This was way more fun.
- Really?

39:04.142 --> 39:05.444
Definitely.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.447
You are something else.

39:08.514 --> 39:09.681
You went from a night
on the town

39:09.748 --> 39:12.350
to a night in a pup tent
without a hitch.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.753
Yeah, life's too short to whine.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.854
It is.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.792
You know, you spend a day
with these kids..

39:20.859 --> 39:21.927
...you realize..

39:37.643 --> 39:40.145
This...this is totally
random..

39:42.414 --> 39:45.917
...but sometimes
I imagine a night..

39:48.119 --> 39:49.455
...you know, in-in the future..

39:53.592 --> 39:56.127
...a night where
I would take you out..

39:56.194 --> 39:59.865
...spend money and make
a big deal about it...

40:12.711 --> 40:14.846
And it would end like this..

40:22.387 --> 40:23.889
...when I ask you to marry me.

40:28.994 --> 40:29.961
What do you think?

40:32.263 --> 40:33.899
I think I'd say yes.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.013
(Vera)
'Dr. Morris?'

40:50.348 --> 40:52.784
I can't fall asleep.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.420
Yeah, she's never been
to a sleepover before.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.623
She's homesick.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.558
Well, what do you..
What do you need, Em?

40:59.625 --> 41:02.594
My dad tells me a bedtime
story every night.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.696
Not a problem. Alright.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.002
Okay, let me see.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.207
Once upon a time..

41:17.676 --> 41:19.711
there was a little blood cell

41:21.112 --> 41:24.850
...who couldn't find
his way to the lungs.

41:24.916 --> 41:27.719
Now he was..
He was blue all the time

41:27.786 --> 41:29.821
but he wished that he was red.

41:29.888 --> 41:32.290
He needs a Rastelli operation.

41:32.357 --> 41:33.491
(Archie)
'Wha..'

41:33.559 --> 41:35.493
'No, no, no,
a Blalock-Taussig.'

41:35.561 --> 41:36.928
He has tetralogy.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.998
Hey, who's telling the
story anyway, huh?

41:40.065 --> 41:41.032
[Emily chuckle]

41:42.133 --> 41:43.201
[Archie laughing]

41:43.268 --> 41:47.505
(Russell)
'Three ounces down the hatch.'

41:47.573 --> 41:51.643
How about a...nice
burp for Russell?

41:56.514 --> 41:57.683
Okay.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.017
- Oh.
- Oh!

41:59.084 --> 42:01.620
[laughing]

42:01.687 --> 42:04.255
Hey, that was a good one.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.057
That was a quick one.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.159
There we go.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.161
High five. Yes!

42:10.228 --> 42:12.497
Now tomorrow, we're going
to work on that fist bump.

42:12.564 --> 42:13.732
Okay?

42:14.633 --> 42:17.102
[baby cooing]

42:17.168 --> 42:18.637
Mmm.

42:18.704 --> 42:19.938
[baby fussing]

42:20.005 --> 42:20.906
Oh.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.274
There we go. There we go..

42:26.144 --> 42:28.079
[indistinct]

42:41.693 --> 42:43.094
