00:25.708 --> 00:27.333
<i>I've always thought</i>

00:27.833 --> 00:29.666
<i>that the sound of an IV drip</i>

00:29.750 --> 00:32.000
<i>is similar to the sound
of the clock ticking.</i>

00:33.125 --> 00:35.000
<i>It calms you down</i>

00:35.083 --> 00:36.333
<i>and makes you feel peaceful.</i>

00:38.041 --> 00:39.250
<i>However,</i>

00:39.750 --> 00:42.458
<i>it's also like you're counting down
to the end of your life.</i>

01:08.041 --> 01:09.541
Che-kai, you're up?

01:10.958 --> 01:12.416
How do you feel?

01:13.291 --> 01:14.541
Doctor, where's my dad?

01:14.625 --> 01:16.125
He's conscious now.

01:16.208 --> 01:18.375
But you should be prepared.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.250
He might

01:20.333 --> 01:21.791
only have a few days left.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.666
Che-kai.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.333
I have something to tell you.

01:27.791 --> 01:30.208
<i>Dad, let me ask you something.</i>

01:31.333 --> 01:34.541
<i>If you knew that life would end this way,</i>

01:36.000 --> 01:37.875
<i>would you choose to start it?</i>

01:37.958 --> 01:39.250
THOSE LEFT BEHIND

01:41.791 --> 01:44.458
<i>Welcome back
to</i> Music Under a Starry Night.

01:44.541 --> 01:45.583
<i>We were just talking about A-Lin</i>

01:45.666 --> 01:47.916
<i>who recently signed with
a new company, E Shine.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:49.750
<i>Everyone is looking forward</i>

01:49.833 --> 01:51.958
<i>to her first album at the new company.</i>

01:52.041 --> 01:54.625
<i>What kind of surprise
will she have for us?</i>

01:54.708 --> 01:57.833
<i>We've heard that
the producer is Wang Po-han.</i>

01:57.916 --> 02:01.125
<i>He's a top producer
who has won a Golden Melody Award.</i>

02:01.208 --> 02:02.500
<i>Their collaboration will lead</i>

02:02.583 --> 02:04.583
<i>to another best-selling album, right?</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:06.291
<i>Let us wait and see.</i>

02:06.375 --> 02:09.041
<i>Next, we will play you an old English song</i>

02:09.125 --> 02:10.458
<i>"First Poem."</i>

02:12.333 --> 02:13.708
SLEEPING PILLS

02:16.833 --> 02:18.666
<i>We've talked about this.</i>

02:18.750 --> 02:20.125
<i>Your songs are good,</i>

02:20.208 --> 02:22.583
<i>but they don't fit the album.</i>

02:23.708 --> 02:24.750
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

02:25.750 --> 02:27.083
There's no need to be sorry.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.750
I know I'm just not good enough

02:28.833 --> 02:30.083
to write songs like this.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.916
<i>Po-han, you're too rational.</i>

02:33.000 --> 02:35.375
Pop songs have their formulas.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.250
That's how you make money.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.750
<i>But they might not touch people's hearts.</i>

02:41.791 --> 02:42.666
<i>Don't worry.</i>

02:42.750 --> 02:44.791
<i>I'll get you the copyright.</i>

02:44.875 --> 02:45.750
<i>Okay?</i>

02:45.833 --> 02:48.375
<i>Okay. You probably didn't get much sleep.</i>

02:48.458 --> 02:50.958
<i>Get some rest. Bye.</i>

03:08.833 --> 03:09.916
What theâ€¦

03:19.708 --> 03:20.625
Hello?

03:20.708 --> 03:22.583
<i>Hello, is this Wang Po-han?</i>

03:22.666 --> 03:23.666
Yes.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.000
<i>This is the police station.</i>

03:25.083 --> 03:25.958
What?

03:26.041 --> 03:27.416
<i>This is not a crime, is it?</i>

03:27.500 --> 03:30.250
I was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.083
I didn't do anything.
I didn't steal anything!

03:32.166 --> 03:33.375
-You can ask--
-Keep talking

03:33.958 --> 03:35.208
and I'll lock you up.

03:37.833 --> 03:38.958
Ms. Yu,

03:39.041 --> 03:40.333
is there anything missing?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.416
-Not yet.
-I told you!

03:42.500 --> 03:43.875
I really didn't steal anything.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.208
-I just didn't--
-But I need to go back

03:46.291 --> 03:48.041
and check all the valuable equipment.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.958
I swear I didn't touch
any of your equipment.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.333
You know I was only there
for K's belongings.

03:53.416 --> 03:55.208
Also, she hit me.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.208
Didn't she break the law?

03:56.291 --> 03:58.166
I think I'm missing a camera lens.
Write that down.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.083
Lying is also a crime, isn't it?

04:00.750 --> 04:03.083
Here's some money.
I'm bailing out my sister.

04:03.666 --> 04:05.875
Little guy,
you're bribing a police officer!

04:05.958 --> 04:07.125
That won't do.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.875
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

04:08.958 --> 04:09.916
Name?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.791
Why can he cut in line?

04:13.125 --> 04:14.541
He can go first if he's in a hurry.

04:15.666 --> 04:17.375
What's your sister's name?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.375
An Yi-chi.

04:19.458 --> 04:21.125
Who are you looking for, sir?

04:21.875 --> 04:22.708
An Yi-chi.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.416
I'm really sorry, Ms. Yu.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.583
Check when you get back.

04:29.666 --> 04:31.833
I'll pay for anything missing.

04:31.916 --> 04:34.083
I told you, I don't have that song.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.125
I'll let it slide today.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.500
If this happens again, I'll sue you.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.125
I'm sorry.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.541
What are you doing?

04:47.041 --> 04:48.541
You told me to do whatever it takes

04:48.625 --> 04:50.375
to get the copyright.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.041
I wasn't talking about breaking the law.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.541
You can't even do such a simple thing.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.666
Buckle up.

05:09.750 --> 05:10.666
Okay.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.208
So did you find anything

05:19.291 --> 05:21.291
about copyright transferring in there?

05:21.875 --> 05:23.333
No.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.375
But, you know what I found?

05:28.916 --> 05:29.916
What's that?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.208
K's diary.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.041
So you didn't just break in,

05:38.125 --> 05:39.541
you actually stole something.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.833
But it's K's diary.

05:42.916 --> 05:43.875
I think

05:43.958 --> 05:46.458
there might be something
about the copyright in here

05:46.541 --> 05:49.000
or where he got the inspiration for it.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.083
I'm serious.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.416
Po-han,

05:52.500 --> 05:55.750
can you please drive Ke-le and me home?

05:57.916 --> 05:59.000
Po-han?

06:01.166 --> 06:02.000
-Po-han!
-What?

06:03.625 --> 06:05.791
An Yi-chi, let's go home.

06:06.916 --> 06:08.833
Just leave him here.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.083
An Yi-chi, your boss is so heavy.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.041
He's really heavy.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.333
An Ke-le, come here.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.125
Take off Po-han's shoes for me.

06:31.750 --> 06:32.750
I need to go to bed.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.583
Hey, An Ke-le.

06:38.416 --> 06:39.541
Why are these so tight?

06:44.458 --> 06:45.541
Why are these so tight?

06:47.916 --> 06:49.791
-An Yi-chi.
-What?

06:49.875 --> 06:51.208
One week.

06:51.833 --> 06:52.708
What?

06:53.708 --> 06:55.875
If you can't get
the copyright in one week,

06:56.458 --> 06:57.875
don't bother coming to work.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.416
You're in my house right now.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.875
How dare you threaten me?

07:18.958 --> 07:21.416
<i>I hear that you are looking
for a love song.</i>

07:21.500 --> 07:22.708
<i>Give me a chance.</i>

07:22.791 --> 07:25.250
-What? This person has the wrong number.
<i>-Perhaps, I'm the one you want.</i>

07:37.958 --> 07:39.750
<i>That day, I woke up in the hospital.</i>

07:40.958 --> 07:42.375
<i>The doctor told me that</i>

07:42.875 --> 07:44.458
<i>my dad only had a few more days to live.</i>

07:46.708 --> 07:49.708
<i>I thought that was the worst situation.</i>

07:57.333 --> 07:58.333
Kai-kai.

08:00.625 --> 08:01.791
Mom?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.791
<i>So the doctor said</i>

08:09.000 --> 08:10.708
your dad only has a few days left?

08:13.750 --> 08:14.750
Yes.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.583
At least he won't feel pain anymore.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.583
Maybe it's not a bad thing.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.625
He has been enduring it all
for a decade already.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.000
It's enough.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.583
I'll drive you.

08:57.125 --> 08:58.166
Let's go.

09:04.458 --> 09:05.541
Mom.

09:08.541 --> 09:10.041
Do you want this

09:10.541 --> 09:11.958
to end soon?

09:16.416 --> 09:18.250
Who would want to be sick like that?

09:20.500 --> 09:21.916
Your dad has had a hard time.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.958
It's hard for you.

09:27.916 --> 09:29.416
It's hard for me too.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.166
Over the past ten years,

09:33.083 --> 09:35.208
we've all worked hard enough.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.583
We did our best.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.125
Okay?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.125
If it were me lying there,

10:03.791 --> 10:05.291
what would you do?

10:13.791 --> 10:15.333
Kai-kai, go home and get some rest.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.458
You have class tomorrow.

10:17.958 --> 10:19.708
I'll take care of your dad tonight.

10:26.833 --> 10:27.958
I'll get going then.

10:42.291 --> 10:43.416
You bitch!

10:43.500 --> 10:44.958
-I'm sorry.
-Why?

10:45.041 --> 10:47.291
-It's all your fault!
-I didn't know. I'm sorry.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.666
I'm really sorry.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.875
-How dare you call him?
-I'm so sorry!

10:50.958 --> 10:51.958
This is crazy.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.916
You are a mistress! You're so shameless!

10:54.000 --> 10:55.708
How dare you call him?

10:55.791 --> 10:56.750
-You called him?
-I'm sorry!

10:56.833 --> 10:57.750
-I'm so sorry!
-Stop it!

10:57.833 --> 10:59.041
-I'll make you cry!
-I'm sorry!

10:59.125 --> 11:00.583
-It's none of your business!
-Okay. What are you doing?

11:00.666 --> 11:02.250
-Don't do that.
-What's wrong with you?

11:02.333 --> 11:04.333
-I'm sorry.
-I told you not to do that.

11:04.416 --> 11:07.208
-Why?
-What are you doing, Sung Yuan-yuan?

11:11.666 --> 11:12.750
Hello?

11:14.083 --> 11:15.750
Yes, okay.

11:16.625 --> 11:17.666
Got it.

11:17.750 --> 11:18.916
Why did you hit her?

11:19.708 --> 11:21.000
Sir,

11:21.083 --> 11:22.375
she's just a child.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.500
I'm fine.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.916
Just let me leave.

11:26.416 --> 11:27.500
Miss,

11:27.583 --> 11:29.208
look at your injuries.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.291
At least let her pay
for your hospital bills.

11:32.333 --> 11:33.666
I'm fine.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.958
I don't need it.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.458
I'm here for Sung Yuan-yuan.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.250
Yuan-yuan.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.833
Sir, excuse me.

11:46.916 --> 11:49.000
-I'm Sung Yuan-yuan's aunt.
-Hello.

11:49.083 --> 11:49.916
I'm sorry.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.041
She hasn't been herself lately.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.750
Could you please let it go?

11:53.833 --> 11:55.041
<i>What about our family?</i>

11:55.625 --> 11:57.708
What about those who are left behind?

11:59.291 --> 12:02.041
-This is a battery case--
-She's usually a good kid.

12:02.125 --> 12:02.958
It's justâ€¦

12:04.333 --> 12:07.375
She lost her family in a car accident.

12:07.458 --> 12:08.625
She's the only one left.

12:08.708 --> 12:10.083
She's only acting like this

12:10.166 --> 12:11.583
because she's upset.

12:11.666 --> 12:13.750
-She would never do--
-Please calm down, miss.

12:17.041 --> 12:18.000
Sir,

12:18.083 --> 12:19.208
please.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.541
She's too young to have a criminal record.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.250
Yuan-yuan, stop that. It's embarrassing.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.541
It's embarrassing?

12:30.625 --> 12:32.000
Who does it embarrass?

12:34.875 --> 12:36.416
My parents?

12:39.666 --> 12:41.208
Sung Yuan-yuan, keep it together.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.000
You're not the only one
who lost your family.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.208
<i>That night,</i>

12:56.208 --> 12:58.791
<i>Sung Yuan-yuan,
who didn't shed a single tear,</i>

12:59.916 --> 13:01.625
<i>had so much pain</i>

13:02.125 --> 13:03.500
<i>and loneliness in her eyes.</i>

13:04.666 --> 13:06.375
<i>I knew how it felt.</i>

13:15.000 --> 13:16.416
So you're not going to sue me?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.666
-Then I'm leaving.
-Miss!

13:21.750 --> 13:23.000
-Yuan-yuan!
-Yuan-yuan!

13:25.291 --> 13:26.333
Aren't you thatâ€¦

13:26.416 --> 13:27.708
Why are you here?

13:28.458 --> 13:29.875
If you don't intend to sue,

13:30.916 --> 13:32.708
please check the statement.

13:32.791 --> 13:34.458
If there are no more issues,
please sign your name.

14:04.041 --> 14:04.916
I'm sorry.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.291
I didn't know my dad

14:08.958 --> 14:10.333
hit your family with his car.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.125
So what if you knew?

14:12.916 --> 14:14.375
Can they come back to life?

14:17.458 --> 14:19.208
Regarding the compensation
for the accident,

14:19.708 --> 14:21.250
I'll pay you back slowly.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.291
Whatever.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.166
No wonder you kept hitting me.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.083
You can hit me all you want from now on.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.291
I said I won't hit you again.

14:42.625 --> 14:44.500
I thought it was strange.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.250
Who transfers during
the last semester of high school?

14:48.875 --> 14:52.541
You're here for revenge, aren't you?

14:56.250 --> 14:58.083
I just wanted to see

14:58.666 --> 15:00.541
how the killer's son is doing.

15:02.541 --> 15:03.958
It turns out he's doing terrible.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.541
That's not even the worst thing.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.458
What do you mean?

15:12.958 --> 15:14.541
The doctor said that my dad

15:15.458 --> 15:17.166
will pass away in a few days.

15:20.416 --> 15:21.958
There's nothing I can do.

15:26.916 --> 15:28.250
Hey,

15:29.041 --> 15:30.750
why were you hitting that lady?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.750
She was my dad's mistress.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.333
My parents had been arguing
about this for a while.

15:44.541 --> 15:46.875
I went through my dad's phone records

15:47.375 --> 15:49.541
and found out that
when the accident happened,

15:50.250 --> 15:51.750
that lady just called to make a fuss.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.125
That's whenâ€¦

16:00.041 --> 16:02.458
That's enough. I'm hungry.

16:02.541 --> 16:03.958
Let's go get some food.

16:07.291 --> 16:11.291
They have instant noodles and <i>oden</i> here.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.416
I want to eat braised meat.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.625
That's expensive.

16:17.208 --> 16:18.750
After all, you're buying.

16:18.833 --> 16:19.833
Come on.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.208
I want to eat pig blood's cake, pigskin,

16:24.291 --> 16:26.041
-and enoki mushrooms.
-Don't order too much.

16:26.125 --> 16:27.416
Why not?

16:28.208 --> 16:30.125
â€¦and cabbageâ€¦

16:32.458 --> 16:33.416
Dad,

16:33.500 --> 16:35.666
where's the CD you mentioned last time?

16:37.791 --> 16:39.750
MAE, BENEDICT GARFIELD

16:46.708 --> 16:48.000
Oh no,

16:48.625 --> 16:50.000
I can't listen to it anymore.

16:58.958 --> 17:00.250
The CD is broken,

17:01.500 --> 17:02.750
but their song

17:03.333 --> 17:04.791
hasn't disappeared.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.708
Butâ€¦

17:07.791 --> 17:08.875
Che-kai.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.625
Some things might break,

17:13.125 --> 17:14.458
they might disappear,

17:15.333 --> 17:17.458
but they'll exist in other forms.

17:20.708 --> 17:21.750
Right here.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.833
You'll remember it forever.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.375
Right?

17:54.250 --> 17:55.541
<i>Chang Che-kai.</i>

17:55.625 --> 17:56.916
Chang Che-kai.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.041
What?

18:00.125 --> 18:01.375
The teacher is asking for you.

19:20.583 --> 19:24.125
THE LATE CHANG KUN-CHENG'S ASHES

19:54.083 --> 19:55.958
PING HE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE

19:56.041 --> 19:57.958
CHANG CHE-KAI,
CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA

20:02.958 --> 20:04.500
If we sell the house,

20:04.583 --> 20:07.791
we'll be able to pay off compensation.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.208
The remaining moneyâ€¦

20:10.708 --> 20:12.208
Keep it for yourself.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.291
Here.

20:14.791 --> 20:16.000
Keep it nicely.

20:22.541 --> 20:23.583
I'm sorry.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.041
Take care of yourself.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.208
You're all grown up now.

20:36.791 --> 20:38.125
Take care of yourself.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.000
I have to go.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.125
Mom!

20:52.041 --> 20:53.916
I promise I'll take care of myself.

20:54.541 --> 20:56.166
I won't bother you again.

20:56.666 --> 20:58.250
Please don't go.

21:11.916 --> 21:13.250
<i>Stay for tests?</i>

21:13.750 --> 21:15.375
What are they for?

21:15.458 --> 21:17.000
While you were unconscious,

21:17.083 --> 21:19.375
we did some emergency blood tests.

21:19.458 --> 21:22.375
Some abnormalities were found.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.125
Abnormalities?

21:25.208 --> 21:26.458
What do you mean?

21:27.708 --> 21:29.083
You might

21:30.250 --> 21:31.666
have what your dad has.

21:35.541 --> 21:37.666
<i>If it were me lying there,</i>

21:40.291 --> 21:41.625
what would you do?

21:53.875 --> 21:55.875
Kai-kai, go home and get some rest.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.958
You have class tomorrow.

21:58.041 --> 22:00.166
I'll take care of your dad tonight.

22:09.583 --> 22:10.625
Mom.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.875
Don't go.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.750
It's okay.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.500
I'll get going then.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.708
Mom!

22:53.083 --> 22:54.125
Mom!

23:52.166 --> 23:53.666
An Yi-chi.

23:54.958 --> 23:56.125
You're mine.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.416
I want to hold you while I sleep.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.791
You're like a baby.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.375
Thank you for being my baby.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.208
Hey,

24:23.291 --> 24:24.416
wake up.

24:25.625 --> 24:26.708
Hey.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.708
Hey!

25:03.958 --> 25:05.041
You're up?

25:05.125 --> 25:06.291
Yes.

25:14.791 --> 25:16.958
-Where's your sister?
-She went out to run some errands.

25:17.041 --> 25:18.375
She'll be right back.

25:30.958 --> 25:32.083
Let's eat.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.375
-Your sister made it?
-It's delicious, right?

25:54.458 --> 25:56.291
These ready-to-eat
food packets are expensive.

25:56.375 --> 25:58.750
But you're a VIP, so we can splurge a bit.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.458
You're my sister's boss.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.500
You must make a lot of money, right?

26:07.333 --> 26:08.666
What?

26:09.333 --> 26:10.750
Let me ask you something.

26:10.833 --> 26:12.333
You're not married yet, right?

26:12.416 --> 26:14.041
Do you have a girlfriend?

26:14.125 --> 26:16.125
Or maybe a boyfriend?

26:17.125 --> 26:18.625
I'm single

26:18.708 --> 26:19.541
and I like women.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.375
-Maybe you can consider--
-No.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.000
Not interested.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.375
Your sister is less mature than you are.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.333
She's not interested in you anyway.

26:28.916 --> 26:29.833
That's good.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.250
Po-han, you're up?

26:38.833 --> 26:39.750
Yes.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.791
I'm done.

26:48.291 --> 26:50.416
What? You got into a fight with my son?

26:53.333 --> 26:54.291
Your son?

27:02.875 --> 27:04.541
I read K's diary yesterday.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.208
He wrote about his mom.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.958
So I went over to Pop Hit.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.166
But Pang said

27:11.250 --> 27:13.083
K never talked about his mom.

27:15.208 --> 27:16.416
What if

27:16.500 --> 27:19.875
we get a private detective
to look into it?

27:19.958 --> 27:21.791
Okay, I'll do that.

27:23.416 --> 27:25.125
Would you like to read his diary?

27:25.208 --> 27:28.416
There might be some clues in there.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.416
I don't want to read someone's diary.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.666
It's not classy.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.583
You said we're running out of time
to get the copyright.

27:35.666 --> 27:38.708
Even so, you still have
to scrub the bottom of your bowls.

27:38.791 --> 27:39.833
What?

27:39.916 --> 27:40.750
I did.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.375
They're so oily. Let me do it.

27:42.458 --> 27:43.500
Out of the way.

27:52.208 --> 27:54.375
Why does your son call you his sister?

27:56.875 --> 27:58.916
I had Ke-le when I was in college.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.333
His dad's not in the picture.

28:00.833 --> 28:02.750
I think it's just easier

28:02.833 --> 28:03.958
if he calls me his sister.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.333
Did you tell him to do that?

28:09.208 --> 28:10.625
You think I would do that?

28:11.333 --> 28:12.375
Who knows?

28:24.500 --> 28:26.750
-An Yi-chi?
-It wasn't me.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.000
It really wasn't me. I wouldn't dare.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.416
It must have been An Ke-le.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.625
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Hold on.

28:32.708 --> 28:33.708
I need to take this.

28:36.625 --> 28:39.500
CHENG EN HOSPITAL - DR. HSIEH

28:40.083 --> 28:41.125
Hello?

28:43.458 --> 28:44.583
Okay, I understand.

28:45.750 --> 28:46.833
Thank you.

28:46.916 --> 28:48.208
Bye.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.416
What's wrong?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.041
Nothing.

28:55.125 --> 28:57.208
Go and wash your face.

28:57.291 --> 28:58.333
I'll do the dishes.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.333
Excuse me.

31:05.791 --> 31:07.208
Hey, you're in the way.

31:07.291 --> 31:08.458
I'm sorry.

31:10.041 --> 31:12.041
-Please add this.
-Sure.

31:14.875 --> 31:16.000
What's up?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.041
Nothing.

31:25.875 --> 31:28.458
I told you in the text message
I sent yesterday.

31:28.541 --> 31:30.541
Kai-kai didn't leave me anything.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.916
I know, ma'am.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.875
But this song might have been
your son's last work.

31:38.875 --> 31:43.000
Do you have any information
about the copyright to this song?

31:45.333 --> 31:47.708
He doesn't tell me things like that.

31:48.625 --> 31:50.875
There was only one person
he was closest to,

31:51.375 --> 31:52.916
Sung Yuan-yuan.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.083
You can talk to her.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.250
We heard she's gone too.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.333
Other than Sung Yuan-yuan,

32:03.416 --> 32:07.208
do you know who else Che-kai was close to?

32:12.791 --> 32:15.375
So after you left Chang Che-kai,

32:15.458 --> 32:17.625
you never talked to him again?

32:20.791 --> 32:23.583
<i>You said your name is Sung Yuan-yuan?</i>

32:25.166 --> 32:26.458
Ma'am,

32:26.958 --> 32:28.125
I'm sorry.

32:32.791 --> 32:34.250
I'm going

32:35.708 --> 32:37.458
to do something very bad to you.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.666
That was for Chang Che-kai.

32:46.291 --> 32:48.333
<i>You may think I'm selfish.</i>

32:49.083 --> 32:51.083
I abandoned my child.

32:53.750 --> 32:56.291
But frankly, the past few years
haven't been easy for me.

32:57.958 --> 33:00.458
Kai-kai is a great kid.

33:00.541 --> 33:04.708
He let me care for him
during his final days.

33:04.791 --> 33:06.583
I'm already grateful for that.

33:06.666 --> 33:09.541
So you never thought
of turning back all these years?

33:09.625 --> 33:10.875
An Yi-chi.

33:14.666 --> 33:16.875
Can you even imagine what I went through?

33:18.375 --> 33:20.791
Have you ever taken care
of a family member who has cancer?

33:22.541 --> 33:26.791
I met his dad 30 years ago.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.625
That's when
I started dealing with all this.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.708
From the early stages

33:31.791 --> 33:33.458
all the way to the end,

33:35.333 --> 33:38.375
you never knew
when he'd suddenly pass away.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.000
That kind of uncertainty,

33:41.208 --> 33:43.416
<i>all those medical bills and hospital feesâ€¦</i>

33:43.500 --> 33:44.833
<i>That kind of mental tortureâ€¦</i>

33:46.541 --> 33:48.416
<i>How would you be able to understand?</i>

33:50.875 --> 33:52.416
What about Chang Che-kai?

33:52.500 --> 33:53.625
What did he do wrong?

33:54.291 --> 33:55.708
What did he do wrong to deserve that?

33:55.791 --> 33:57.833
Would you be able to understand?

33:57.916 --> 33:59.875
You think I don't blame myself?

33:59.958 --> 34:01.625
I cried all night at the hospital,

34:01.708 --> 34:03.541
but what can I change?

34:06.083 --> 34:07.875
I feel sorry for Kai-kai.

34:09.208 --> 34:11.041
But who feels sorry for me?

34:12.041 --> 34:13.958
Just because I'm his mom,

34:14.041 --> 34:15.208
do I deserve all this?

34:15.291 --> 34:18.833
I had to experience the loss
of two of the people I love the most.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.083
What are you talking about?

34:20.916 --> 34:22.875
You don't deserve to be a mom.

34:24.500 --> 34:25.500
That's right.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It's hard. You're tired all the time.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.416
<i>Everything you do is for him.</i>

34:32.500 --> 34:35.000
<i>Every penny you earn</i>

34:35.083 --> 34:37.291
<i>is to fill a bottomless hole of debt.</i>

34:37.375 --> 34:38.958
An-an, it's time for the meeting.

34:39.041 --> 34:39.958
Okay.

34:40.625 --> 34:43.375
Maybe you don't even know
how to have hope.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.125
Every day that passes

34:48.666 --> 34:50.000
just adds on extra frustration.

34:53.375 --> 34:55.000
But you can't run away.

34:57.291 --> 34:59.541
You just can't.

35:02.041 --> 35:03.916
<i>Because at that time, Chang Che-kai</i>

35:05.791 --> 35:07.000
<i>only had you.</i>

35:19.875 --> 35:20.833
Mom.

35:45.875 --> 35:46.916
An Yi-chi.
