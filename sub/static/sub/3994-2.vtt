00:32.119 --> 00:34.679
Hello.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.199
Are you all right?

00:36.200 --> 00:38.279
What is it, dear? Are you lost?

01:49.280 --> 01:52.159
Well, that was tedious.
You went on the tube like that?

01:52.160 --> 01:54.200
None of the cabs would take me.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.279
Nothing?

02:05.280 --> 02:08.598
Military coup in Uganda.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.199
Another photo of you
with the...

02:13.200 --> 02:17.159
Well, um, Cabinet reshuffle?

02:17.160 --> 02:18.719
Nothing of importance?

02:18.720 --> 02:21.319
God!

02:21.320 --> 02:25.199
John, I need some. Get me some.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.999
No. Get me some.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.519
No. Cold turkey we agreed,
no matter what.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.999
Anyway, you've paid
everyone off, remember?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.599
No-one within a two-mile radius
will sell you any.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.279
Stupid idea. Whose idea was that?

02:38.401 --> 02:40.240
Mrs Hudson!

02:45.560 --> 02:51.399
Look, Sherlock, you're doing
really well, don't give up now!

02:51.400 --> 02:52.600
Tell me where they are!

02:52.601 --> 02:54.000
Please, tell me.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.039
Please.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.519
Can't help, sorry. I'll let you know
next week's lottery numbers.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.760
It was worth a try.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.439
My secret supply, what have you done
with my secret supply?

03:12.440 --> 03:14.639
Cigarettes, what have you done
with them?

03:14.640 --> 03:18.599
You never let me touch your things!
Chance would be a fine thing.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.559
I thought you weren't
my housekeeper. I'm not.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.999
How about a nice cuppa and perhaps
you could put away your harpoon?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.400
I need something stronger than tea.
Seven percent stronger.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.119
You've been to see Mr Chatterjee
again. Pardon?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.540
Sandwich shop. That's a new dress,
but there's flour on the sleeve.

03:37.541 --> 03:39.959
You wouldn't dress
like that for baking.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.679
Sherlock...
Thumbnail. Tiny traces of foil.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.839
Been at the scratch cards again.
We all know where that leads.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.799
Kasbah Nights. Racy for a
Monday morning, wouldn't you agree?

03:49.800 --> 03:53.159
I wrote a blog on the identification
of perfumes. You should look it up!

03:53.160 --> 03:55.820
Please! Don't pin your hopes
on that cruise with Mr

03:55.821 --> 03:58.479
Chatterjee, he's got a wife
nobody knows about. Sherlock!

03:58.480 --> 04:00.660
Well, nobody except me.
I don't know what

04:00.661 --> 04:02.839
you're talking about,
I really don't!

04:05.000 --> 04:08.599
What the bloody hell was all
that about? You don't understand.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.920
Go after her and apologise.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.759
Apologise?

04:13.760 --> 04:16.320
John, I envy you so much.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.159
You envy me?

04:19.160 --> 04:22.239
Your mind, it's so placid,
straight-forward, barely used.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.799
Mine's like an engine,
racing out of control.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.560
A rocket, tearing
itself to pieces,

04:26.561 --> 04:28.319
trapped on the launch pad.
I need a case!

04:28.320 --> 04:31.879
You've just solved one, by harpooning
a dead pig, apparently!

04:31.880 --> 04:34.519
That was this morning.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.080
When's the next one?
Nothing on the website?

04:41.160 --> 04:45.119
"Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes.
I can't find Bluebell anywhere.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.359
"Please, please,
please can you help?"

04:47.360 --> 04:50.359
Bluebell? A rabbit, John!
But there's more.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.879
Before Bluebell disappeared,
it turned luminous.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.000
"Like a fairy," according
to little Kirsty.

04:55.001 --> 04:57.119
Then the next morning,
Bluebell was gone.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.279
Hutch still locked,
no sign of a forced entry.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.279
What am I saying, this is brilliant!
Phone Lestrade.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.239
Tell him there's an escaped rabbit.
Are you serious? It's this or Cluedo.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.599
No.
We are never playing that again.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.359
Why not? It's not possible
for the victim to have done it.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.119
It was the only possible solution.
It's not in the rules.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.959
Well, then, the rules are wrong!

05:19.440 --> 05:20.799
A single ring.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.559
Maximum pressure,
just under the half second.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.040
Client!

05:26.640 --> 05:30.319
Dartmoor, it's always been
a place of myth and legend,

05:30.320 --> 05:33.679
but is there something else
lurking out here?

05:33.680 --> 05:35.879
Something very real.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.759
Dartmoor is also home to one the
government's most secret of operations,

05:39.760 --> 05:42.799
the chemical and biological weapons
research centre,

05:42.800 --> 05:46.359
which is said to be even more
sensitive than Porton Down.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.919
Since the end of
the Second World War,

05:48.920 --> 05:52.559
there have been persistent stories
about the Baskerville experiments.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.119
Genetic mutations,
animals grown for the battlefield.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.840
There are many who
believe that within this

05:58.841 --> 06:01.559
compound, in the heart of
this ancient wildness,

06:01.560 --> 06:04.879
there are horrors beyond imagining.

06:04.880 --> 06:09.039
But the real question is,
are all of them still inside?'

06:09.040 --> 06:11.680
I was just a kid.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.359
It was on the moor.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.479
It was dark, but I know what I saw.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.840
I know what killed my father.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.720
What did you see?

06:24.721 --> 06:27.279
I was just about to say.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.079
Yes, in a TV interview.
I prefer to do my own editing.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.880
Yes. Sorry, yes, of course.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.199
Excuse me.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.320
In your own time.

06:39.321 --> 06:41.560
But quite quickly.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.119
Do you know Dartmoor, Mr Holmes? No.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.719
It's an amazing place,
it's like nowhere else,

06:50.720 --> 06:54.279
it's sort of bleak, but beautiful.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.440
Not interested. Moving on.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.719
We used to go for walks,
after my mum died, my dad and me.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.239
Every evening,
we'd go out onto the moor.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.320
Good. Skipping to the
night that your dad was

07:06.321 --> 07:08.400
violently killed, where
did that happen?

07:10.240 --> 07:12.839
There's a place,

07:12.840 --> 07:17.520
it's a sort of local landmark,
called Dewer's Hollow.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.360
That's an ancient name
for the devil.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.960
So?

07:25.040 --> 07:27.200
Did you see the devil that night?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.119
Yes.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.679
It was huge.

07:35.680 --> 07:40.160
Coal-black fur with red eyes.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.039
It got him.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.800
Tore at him, tore him apart.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.999
I can't remember anything else.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.919
They found me the next morning,
just wandering on the moor.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.959
My dad's body was never found.

08:04.440 --> 08:09.159
Red eyes, coal-black fur,
enormous...

08:09.160 --> 08:10.599
A dog? Wolf?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.160
Or a genetic experiment.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.959
Are you laughing at me, Mr Holmes?

08:16.960 --> 08:18.160
Why, are you joking?

08:19.280 --> 08:23.239
My dad was always going on about the
things they were doing at Baskerville.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.199
About the type of monsters
they were breeding there.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.479
People used to laugh at him.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.999
At least the TV people
took me seriously.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.078
And I assume did wonders
for Devon tourism. Yeah...

08:36.080 --> 08:41.438
Henry, whatever did happen
to your father, it was 20 years ago.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.318
Why come to us now?

08:43.320 --> 08:48.359
Not sure you can help me, Mr Holmes,
since you find it all so funny!

08:48.360 --> 08:52.960
Because of what happened last night.
Why, what happened last night?

08:54.600 --> 08:56.599
How... How do you know?

08:56.600 --> 08:58.119
I didn't know, I noticed.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.839
You came up from Devon
on the first train this morning.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.240
You had a disappointing
breakfast and a black coffee.

09:03.241 --> 09:05.639
The girl across the
aisle fancied you.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.079
Though initially keen,
you've changed your mind.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.879
You are anxious to have
your first cigarette of the day.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.960
Sit down, Mr Knight, and do
please smoke. I'd be delighted.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.519
How on Earth did you notice
all that? It's not important...

09:28.520 --> 09:31.839
Punched out holes where your
ticket's been checked. Not now.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.760
I've been cooped-up for ages!
You're showing off.

09:33.761 --> 09:35.679
I am a show-off,
that's what we do.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.160
Train napkin you used to mop up
the spilled coffee.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.799
Strength of the stain shows
that you didn't take milk.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.719
There are traces of ketchup on it
and on your lips and sleeve.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.239
Cooked breakfast, or the nearest
thing those trains manage. Sandwich.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.479
How did you know
it was disappointing?

09:50.480 --> 09:53.839
Is there any other type of breakfast
on a train? The girl.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.039
Female handwriting's distinctive,
wrote her number on the napkin.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.599
I can tell from the angle she wrote
at that she was sat across from you.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.460
After she got off, I
imagine you used the

10:02.461 --> 10:04.319
napkin to mop up
your spilled coffee,

10:04.320 --> 10:06.119
accidentally smudging the numbers.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.160
You've been over the
last four digits in

10:08.161 --> 10:10.199
another pen, so you wanted
to keep the number.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.079
You used the napkin to blow your
nose, so you're not that into her.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.759
Then there's the nicotine stains on
your shaking fingers. I know the signs.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.820
No chance to smoke
when on the train, no

10:18.821 --> 10:20.879
time to roll one before
you got a cab here.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.519
It's just after 9.15,
you're desperate.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.199
The first train from Exeter
to London leaves at 5.46am.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.320
You got the first one,
so something important

10:28.321 --> 10:30.440
must have happened last night.
Am I wrong?

10:32.720 --> 10:33.959
No.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.839
You're right.

10:35.840 --> 10:40.199
You're completely, exactly right.

10:40.200 --> 10:44.600
Bloody hell, I heard you were quick.
It's my job. Now shut up and smoke.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.999
Em.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.879
Henry, your parents both died
and you were what, seven years old?

10:56.880 --> 10:58.519
I know, that...

11:02.640 --> 11:05.119
That must be quite a trauma.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.799
Now, have you ever thought that maybe
you invented this story, this...

11:12.880 --> 11:14.959
to account for it?

11:14.960 --> 11:18.359
That's what Dr Mortimer says.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.399
Who? His therapist. My therapist.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.759
Obviously.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.119
Louise Mortimer.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.719
She's the reason
I came back to Dartmoor.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.919
She thinks I have to face my demons.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.239
What happened when you went back
to Dewer's Hollow last night?

11:32.240 --> 11:34.400
You went there on the
advice of your therapist

11:34.401 --> 11:36.559
and now you're
consulting a detective.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.480
What did you see that
changed everything?

11:38.481 --> 11:40.399
It's a strange
place, the Hollow.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.839
It makes you feel
so cold inside, so afraid.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.320
Yes, if I wanted poetry,
I'd read John's emails to

11:47.321 --> 11:49.799
his girlfriends, much funnier.
What did you see?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.239
Footprints.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.519
On the exact spot
where I saw my father torn apart.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.959
Man's or a woman's?

12:00.960 --> 12:04.879
Neither. They were... Is that it?
Nothing else? Footprints, is that all?

12:04.880 --> 12:07.079
Yes. But they were...

12:07.080 --> 12:10.759
Dr Mortimer wins. It's a childhood
trauma masked by an invented memory.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.640
Boring. Goodbye, Mr Knight,
thank you for smoking.

12:12.641 --> 12:14.519
What about the footprints?

12:14.520 --> 12:18.039
They're probably paw prints, could
be anything, therefore nothing.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.240
Off to Devon with you
and have a cream tea on me.

12:20.241 --> 12:24.040
Mr Holmes, they were
the footprints of a gigantic hound.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.679
Say that again.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.520
I found footprints, they were big...

12:33.521 --> 12:35.119
No, no, no, your exact words.

12:35.120 --> 12:39.400
Repeat your exact words from a moment
ago, exactly as you said them.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.639
Mr Holmes,

12:43.640 --> 12:49.240
they were
the footprints of a gigantic hound.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.479
I'll take the case. Sorry, what?

12:55.480 --> 12:57.420
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention,

12:57.421 --> 12:59.359
it's very promising.
Sorry, what?

12:59.360 --> 13:02.599
A minute ago, footprints were boring,
now they're very promising?

13:02.600 --> 13:04.660
It's got nothing to do
with footprints, you

13:04.661 --> 13:06.719
weren't listening.
Baskerville, heard of it?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.759
Vaguely. It's very hush-hush.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.359
Sounds like a good place to start.
You'll come down?

13:11.360 --> 13:13.678
I can't leave London
at the moment, far too busy.

13:13.679 --> 13:16.080
But don't worry,
I'm putting my best man onto it.

13:16.081 --> 13:18.240
I can always rely on John
to send me the relevant

13:18.241 --> 13:20.399
data, as he never
understands a word of it.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.760
What are you talking about?
You don't have a case!

13:22.761 --> 13:25.119
You were complaining...
I've got Bluebell!

13:25.120 --> 13:27.960
The case of the vanishing
glow-in-the-dark rabbit.

13:27.961 --> 13:30.800
NATO's in uproar.
You're not coming, then?

13:34.960 --> 13:36.200
OK.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.880
OK.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.919
I don't need those any more,
I'm going to Dartmoor.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.879
You go on ahead, Henry, we'll follow
later. Sorry, so you are coming?

13:54.880 --> 13:58.559
20-year-old disappearance,
a monstrous hound?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.840
I wouldn't miss this for the world!

14:04.920 --> 14:08.439
..cruise together, you had
no intention of taking me on a boat!

14:09.960 --> 14:13.439
Looks like Mrs Hudson
finally got to the wife in Doncaster.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.480
Wait until she finds out
about the one in Islamabad.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.880
Paddington Station, please.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.640
There's Baskerville.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.159
That's Grimpen Village.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.759
So that must be...

15:37.760 --> 15:40.599
Yes, Dewer's Hollow.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.279
What's that?

15:43.280 --> 15:44.919
A mine field?

15:44.920 --> 15:49.519
Technically,
Baskerville's an army base,

15:49.520 --> 15:52.439
so I guess they've always been keen
to keep people out.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.840
Clearly.

16:18.680 --> 16:22.439
Right, three tours a day.
Tell your friends, tell anyone.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.719
Don't be strangers. And remember,
stay away from the moor at night,

16:25.720 --> 16:28.039
if you value your lives!
Take care.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.160
It's cold.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.400
That part doesn't change.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.600
What does?

16:55.880 --> 17:00.160
There's something else.
It's a word.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.319
Liberty.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.439
Liberty?

17:09.440 --> 17:11.480
And there's another word.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.598
In.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.040
I. N.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.359
Liberty In.
What do you think it means?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.439
Sorry we couldn't do
a double room for you boys.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.119
That's fine. We're not...

17:39.120 --> 17:41.039
There you go.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.160
Ta. I'll just get your change.
Ta.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.599
There you go.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.119
I couldn't help noticing, on the map
of the moor, a skull and crossbones?

17:58.120 --> 17:59.560
That.

18:02.520 --> 18:06.759
Pirates? No. The Great Grimpen
Minefield, they call it. Right.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.319
It's not what you think.
It's the Baskerville testing site.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.119
It's been going for 80-odd years.

18:12.120 --> 18:16.279
I'm not sure anyone really knows
what's there any more.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.079
Explosives? Not just explosives.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.300
Break into that place
and if you're lucky,

18:21.301 --> 18:23.519
you just get blown
up, so they say.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.199
In case you're planning
a wee stroll. Ta. I'll remember.

18:26.200 --> 18:30.359
Aye. No, it buggers up tourism a bit,
so thank God for the demon hound.

18:30.360 --> 18:34.319
Did you see that show? The
documentary? Quite recently, yeah.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.680
God bless Henry Knight
and his monster from hell.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.839
Ever seen it? The hound?
Me? No, no.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.359
Fletcher has.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.999
He runs the walks, the monster walks for
the tourists, you know. He's seen it.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.679
That's handy for trade.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.040
I'm just saying we've been
rushed off our feet, Billy.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.399
Yeah, lots of monster hunters.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.799
It don't take much these days,
one mention on Twitter and whoomph!

18:55.800 --> 18:57.319
We're out of WKD.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.319
Right. What with the monster
and the ruddy prison,

19:00.320 --> 19:02.239
I don't know how we sleep nights.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.759
Do you, Gary? Like a baby.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.879
That's not true. He's a snorer.
Hey, ssh.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.239
Is yours a snorer? Got any crisps?

19:11.240 --> 19:16.200
Yeah. No. All right? Right,
take care. Bye. Take care, bye.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.600
Mind if I join you?

19:25.200 --> 19:30.719
It's not true, is it, you haven't
actually seen this hound thing?

19:30.720 --> 19:35.559
Are you from the papers? No,
nothing like that, just curious.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.119
Have you seen it? Maybe.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.079
Got any proof?

19:40.080 --> 19:43.799
Why would I tell you if I did?
Excuse me.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.519
I called Henry. Bet's off John,
sorry. What? Bet?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.820
My plan needs darkness.
We've got another

19:49.821 --> 19:52.119
half an hour of light.
Wait, wait, what bet?

19:52.120 --> 19:55.919
I bet John here 50 quid that you
couldn't prove you'd seen the hound.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.839
Yeah, the guys in the pub
said you could.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.320
Well, you're going to lose
your money, mate. Yeah?

20:02.321 --> 20:05.039
Yeah. I seen it.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.200
Only about a month ago.
Up at the Hollow.

20:07.201 --> 20:09.359
It was foggy, mind,
couldn't make much out.

20:09.360 --> 20:12.319
I see. No witnesses, I suppose.
No, but... Never are.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.319
No, wait. There.

20:15.320 --> 20:20.719
Is that it? It's not exactly proof,
is it? Sorry, John, I win.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.119
Wait, wait, that's not all. People
don't like going up there, you know.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.479
To the Hollow.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.799
Gives them a bad sort of feeling.

20:30.800 --> 20:34.039
Is it haunted?
Is that supposed to convince me?

20:34.040 --> 20:36.639
Nah, don't be stupid!
Nothing like that.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.399
But I reckon
there is something out there.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.319
Something from Baskerville, escaped.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.759
A clone? A super-dog? Maybe.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.760
God knows what they've
been spraying on us

20:46.761 --> 20:48.759
all these years, or
putting in the water.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.879
I wouldn't trust them
as far as I could spit.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.320
Is that the best you've got?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.439
I had a mate once
who worked for the MOD.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.479
One weekend we were meant to go
fishing, but he never showed up.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.959
Well, not till late.

21:02.960 --> 21:06.679
When he did,
he was white as a sheet.

21:06.680 --> 21:09.559
I can see him now.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.439
"I've seen things today,
Fletcher," he said,

21:13.440 --> 21:15.639
"that I never want to see again.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.479
"Terrible things."

21:19.480 --> 21:23.479
He'd been sent to some secret
army place. Porton Down, maybe.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.799
Maybe Baskerville,
or somewhere else.

21:25.800 --> 21:30.959
In the labs there,
the really secret labs,

21:30.960 --> 21:34.840
he said he'd seen terrible things.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.479
Rats as big as dogs, he said.

21:39.480 --> 21:43.880
And dogs, dogs the size of horses.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.240
We did say 50.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.240
Ta.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.720
Pass, please.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.759
Thank you.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.319
You've got ID for Baskerville?!

22:44.320 --> 22:45.639
How?

22:45.640 --> 22:49.399
It's not specific to this place.
It's my brother's.

22:49.400 --> 22:53.560
Access all areas. I, um, ahem,
acquired it ages ago. Just in case.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.279
Brilliant. What's the matter?
We'll get caught. We won't!

22:59.280 --> 23:01.319
Well, not yet.
Caught in five minutes.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.799
"Hi, we thought we'd have a wander
around your top secret weapons base."

23:04.800 --> 23:08.399
"Really? Great. Come in, kettle's
boiled." That's if we don't get shot.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.640
Clear. Thanks very much. Thank you.

23:12.960 --> 23:16.719
Straight through, sir.
Mycroft's name literally opens doors.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.399
I've told you, he practically is
the British Government.

23:20.400 --> 23:24.440
I reckon we've got about 20 minutes
before they realise something's wrong.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.599
What is it? Are we in trouble?
Are we in trouble, sir.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.639
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
You were expecting us?

23:56.640 --> 24:00.959
Your ID showed up straight away,
Mr Holmes. Corporal Lyons, security.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.740
Is there something wrong, sir?
I hope not,

24:03.741 --> 24:06.519
Corporal, I hope not.
We don't get inspected here.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.920
Ever heard of a spot check?

24:07.921 --> 24:11.959
Captain John Watson,
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Sir.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.239
Major Barrymore won't be pleased,
sir. He'll want to see you both.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.799
I'm afraid we won't have time.
We need the full tour.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.600
Right away. Carry on.
That's an order, Corporal. Yes, sir.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.479
Nice touch.
Haven't pulled rank in ages.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.160
Enjoy it? Yeah.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.559
How many animals do you keep down
here? Lots, sir.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.839
Any ever escape? They'd have to know
how to use that lift, sir.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.879
We're not breeding them that clever.
Unless they have help.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.119
And you are? It's all right,
Dr Frankland,

25:34.120 --> 25:37.759
I'm just showing these gentlemen
around. New faces, how nice.

25:37.760 --> 25:41.040
Careful you don't get stuck here,
though, I only came to fix a tap.

25:42.840 --> 25:46.519
How far down does that lift go?
Quite a way, sir.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.479
And what's down there?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.199
Well, we have to keep
the bins somewhere, sir.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.880
This way please, gentlemen.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.239
So what exactly is it that you do
here?

26:00.240 --> 26:04.159
I thought you'd know, sir,
this being an inspection.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.679
Well, I'm not an expert, am I?

26:05.680 --> 26:10.279
Everything from stem cell research to
trying to cure the common cold, sir.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.559
But mostly weaponry?
Of one sort or another, yes.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.719
Biological, chemical? One war ends,
another begins, sir.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.879
New enemies to fight.
We have to be prepared.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.399
OK, Michael,
let's try Harlow 3 next time.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.319
Dr Stapleton... Stapleton?

26:33.320 --> 26:36.239
Yes? Who's this?

26:36.240 --> 26:41.239
Priority ultra, ma'am, orders from
on high. An inspection. Really?

26:41.240 --> 26:43.460
We are to be accorded every
courtesy, Dr Stapleton.

26:43.461 --> 26:45.679
What's your role at Baskerville?

26:46.800 --> 26:50.719
Accorded every courtesy,
isn't that the idea?

26:50.720 --> 26:53.839
I'm not free to say.
Official secrets.

26:53.840 --> 26:57.759
You most certainly are free,
and I suggest you remain that way.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.199
I have a lot of fingers
in a lot of pies.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.199
I like to mix things up.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.839
Genes, mostly.
Now and again, actual fingers.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.439
Stapleton! I knew I knew your name.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.479
I doubt it.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.959
People say there's no such thing
as coincidence.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.520
Dull lives they must lead.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.620
Have you been talking
to my daughter?

27:21.621 --> 27:23.559
Why did Bluebell have
to die, Dr Stapleton?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.800
The rabbit?
Disappeared from inside a locked

27:25.801 --> 27:28.039
hutch, which was always suggestive.
The rabbit?

27:28.040 --> 27:29.920
Clearly an inside job.
You reckon?

27:29.921 --> 27:32.239
Why? Because it glowed in the dark.

27:32.240 --> 27:35.719
I have absolutely no idea what
you're talking about. Who are you?

27:39.120 --> 27:41.919
We've seen enough for now.
Thank you so much. That's it?

27:41.920 --> 27:44.159
That's it. It's this way, isn't it?

27:44.160 --> 27:45.679
Just a minute!

27:45.680 --> 27:49.479
Did we just break into a military
base to investigate a rabbit?

28:17.880 --> 28:21.480
Ha! 23 minutes.
Mycroft's getting slow.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.520
Hello, again.

28:37.560 --> 28:38.799
Major...

28:38.800 --> 28:41.119
This is bloody outrageous!
Why wasn't I told?!

28:41.120 --> 28:44.759
Major Barrymore, is it?
Yes, well, good.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.479
Very good, we're very impressed.
Aren't we, Mr Holmes?

28:47.480 --> 28:50.180
Hugely. The point of
Baskerville was to eliminate

28:50.181 --> 28:52.879
bureaucratic nonsense!
Sorry, Major. Inspections!

28:52.880 --> 28:55.720
Can't remain unmonitored
for ever, goodness

28:55.721 --> 28:58.559
knows what you'd get up to.
Keep walking. Sir!

28:59.760 --> 29:02.439
ID unauthorised, sir. What?
I've just had the call.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.639
Is that right? Who are you?

29:04.640 --> 29:09.119
Look, there's obviously been
some kind of mistake.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.559
Clearly not, Mycroft Holmes.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.320
Computer error.
It'll all have to go in the report.

29:13.321 --> 29:15.079
What the hell's going on?

29:15.080 --> 29:17.999
It's all right, Major,
I know who these gentlemen are.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.719
You do? Yeah,
I'm getting a little slow on faces,

29:20.720 --> 29:24.199
but Mr Holmes here isn't someone
I expected to show up in this place.

29:24.200 --> 29:28.319
Well... Good to see you again,
Mycroft.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.580
I had the honour of
meeting Mr Holmes at

29:31.581 --> 29:34.840
the WHO conference in...
Brussels, was it?

29:36.160 --> 29:39.399
Vienna. Vienna, that's it.

29:39.400 --> 29:44.600
This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major.
There's obviously been a mistake.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.919
On your head be it, Dr Frankland.

29:50.920 --> 29:54.800
I'll show them out, Corporal.
Very well, sir.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.319
Thank you.

30:04.320 --> 30:08.279
This is about Henry Knight,
isn't it? I thought so.

30:08.280 --> 30:11.020
I knew he wanted help,
but I didn't realise

30:11.021 --> 30:13.759
he was going to contact
Sherlock Holmes!

30:13.760 --> 30:15.680
Don't worry, I know
who you really are.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.599
I'm never off your website.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.239
I thought you'd be wearing the hat.
That wasn't my hat.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.999
I hardly recognise him
without the hat. It wasn't my hat.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.159
I love the blog, too, Dr Watson.
Cheers.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.119
The pink thing. And that one about
the aluminium crutch. Yes.

30:29.120 --> 30:32.599
You know Henry Knight?
Well, I knew his dad better.

30:32.600 --> 30:36.439
He had all sorts of mad theories
about this place.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.479
Still, he was a good friend.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.519
Listen, I can't really talk now.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.719
Here's my cell number.

30:44.720 --> 30:48.039
If I can help with Henry,
give me a call.

30:48.040 --> 30:51.239
I never did ask, Dr Frankland,
what exactly is it that you do here?

30:51.240 --> 30:54.239
Mr Holmes,
I would love to tell you,

30:54.240 --> 30:57.159
but then, of course,
I'd have to kill you.

30:57.160 --> 31:02.039
That would be tremendously ambitious
of you. Tell me about Dr Stapleton.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.159
I never speak ill of a colleague.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.639
But you'd speak well of one,
which you're clearly omitting to do.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.759
I do seem to be, don't I?

31:09.760 --> 31:11.360
I'll be in touch. Any time.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.279
So? So?

31:16.280 --> 31:18.359
What was all that about the rabbit?

31:18.360 --> 31:22.199
Please,
can we not do this, this time?

31:22.200 --> 31:27.199
Do what? You being all mysterious
with your... cheekbones,

31:27.200 --> 31:30.359
and turning your coat collar up
so you look cool.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.480
I don't do that. Yeah, you do.

31:46.880 --> 31:51.999
So, the email from Kirsty.
The missing luminous rabbit.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.079
Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother
specialises in genetic manipulation.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.799
She made her daughter's rabbit
glow in the dark?

31:59.800 --> 32:02.159
Probably a fluorescent gene.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.599
Removed and spliced into the
specimen. Simple enough, these days.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.159
So?

32:07.160 --> 32:13.519
So we know that Dr Stapleton performs
secret genetic experiments on animals.

32:13.520 --> 32:17.760
The question is, has she been working
on something deadlier than a rabbit?

32:20.320 --> 32:23.120
To be fair,
that is quite a wide field.

32:39.800 --> 32:40.959
Hi. Hi.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.760
Come in, come in.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.680
This is...

32:53.720 --> 32:56.839
Are you, um, rich?

32:56.840 --> 32:58.400
Yeah. Right.

33:07.040 --> 33:12.359
There's a couple of words,
it's what I keep seeing.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.159
Liberty.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.360
Liberty? Liberty. And...

33:19.760 --> 33:21.600
In.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.319
It's just that.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.760
Have you finished?

33:29.680 --> 33:32.160
Mean anything to you?
Liberty in death, isn't

33:32.161 --> 33:34.640
that the expression?
The only true freedom.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.679
What now, then?

33:42.680 --> 33:45.519
Sherlock's... got a plan? Yes.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.919
Right. We take you back out
onto the moor.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.479
OK... And see if
anything attacks you. What?

33:51.480 --> 33:54.399
That should bring things to a head.
At night?

33:54.400 --> 33:58.159
You want me to go out there
at night? That's your plan?

33:58.160 --> 34:00.679
Brilliant! Got any better ideas?
That's not a plan.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.840
If there is a monster out
there, John, there's

34:02.841 --> 34:05.000
only one thing to do.
Find out where it lives.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.440
(Sherlock.)

35:38.120 --> 35:41.520
(U, M, Q, R, A. Umqra?)

35:46.920 --> 35:49.080
(Sherlock.)

35:57.440 --> 36:00.519
(Sherlock.)

36:00.520 --> 36:01.919
(Sherlock?)

36:01.920 --> 36:05.519
Met a friend of yours? What?

36:05.520 --> 36:07.239
Dr Frankland?

36:07.240 --> 36:10.519
Right. Bob, yeah.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.359
He seems pretty concerned about you.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.959
He's a worrier, bless him.

36:14.960 --> 36:19.119
He's been very kind to me
since I came back.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.279
He knew your father? Yeah.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.999
But he works at Baskerville. Didn't
your dad have a problem with that?

36:26.000 --> 36:29.799
Well, mates are mates, aren't
they? I mean, look at you and John.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.479
What about us?

36:31.480 --> 36:36.839
Well, I mean, he's a pretty
straightforward bloke and you...

36:36.840 --> 36:41.520
Well, they agreed never to talk
about work, Uncle Bob and my dad.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.960
Dewer's Hollow.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.360
(Sherlock.)

38:26.920 --> 38:30.239
My god, my god,
my god! My god! My god!

38:30.240 --> 38:32.120
Did you see it?

38:47.040 --> 38:49.759
Did you hear that? We saw it.
We saw it!

38:49.760 --> 38:52.520
No, I didn't see anything.

38:53.720 --> 38:56.079
What? What are you talking about?

38:56.080 --> 38:59.440
I didn't see anything.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.959
Look, he must have seen it.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.559
I saw it. He must have.
He must have.

39:10.560 --> 39:14.759
I... Why? Why?
Why would he say that?

39:14.760 --> 39:17.279
It was there, it was.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.479
Henry, Henry, I need you
to sit down. Try and relax, please.

39:20.480 --> 39:24.439
I'm OK, I feel OK. I'm going to give you
something to help you sleep. All right?

39:24.440 --> 39:26.759
This is good news, John.

39:26.760 --> 39:30.479
It's... it's... it's good.

39:30.480 --> 39:33.239
I'm not crazy.

39:33.240 --> 39:37.559
There is a hound there, there is.

39:37.560 --> 39:43.360
And Sherlock, he saw it too.
No matter what he says, he saw it.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.879
Well, he's in a pretty bad way.
He's manic.

39:57.880 --> 40:02.839
Totally convinced there's some
mutant super-dog roaming the moors.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.639
And there isn't, though, is there?

40:04.640 --> 40:07.559
If people knew how to make
a mutant super-dog, we'd know.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.839
It'd be for sale.
I mean, that's how it works.

40:10.840 --> 40:15.159
Listen, on the moor I saw
someone signalling, Morse.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.559
I guess it's Morse.
It doesn't seem to make much sense.

40:19.761 --> 40:24.840
U, M, Q, R, A,
does that mean anything?

40:26.240 --> 40:28.359
So, OK, what have we got?

40:28.360 --> 40:32.199
We know there's footprints,
because Henry found them,

40:32.200 --> 40:34.599
and so did the tour guide bloke.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.240
We all heard something.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.439
Maybe we should just look for
whoever's got a big dog.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.600
Henry's right. What?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.799
I saw it, too.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.959
What? I saw it too, John.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.759
Just... just a minute, you saw what?

40:56.760 --> 40:59.520
A hound. Out there in the Hollow.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.960
A gigantic hound.

41:07.320 --> 41:13.279
Look, Sherlock,
we have to be rational about this.

41:13.280 --> 41:19.599
OK, now you,
of all people, can't just...

41:19.600 --> 41:23.039
Let's just stick to what we know,
yes? Stick to the facts.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.340
Once you've ruled out the
impossible, whatever

41:25.341 --> 41:27.639
remains, however
improbable, must be true.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.480
What does that mean?

41:36.360 --> 41:39.199
Look at me, I'm afraid, John.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.879
Afraid.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.039
Sherlock.

41:43.040 --> 41:47.639
I've always been able to
keep myself distant.

41:47.640 --> 41:51.239
Divorce myself from feelings.

41:51.240 --> 41:55.199
But look, you see,
body's betraying me.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.919
Interesting, yes, emotions.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.679
The grit on the lens,
the fly in the ointment.

41:59.680 --> 42:05.079
Yeah, all right, Spock,
just... take it easy.

42:05.080 --> 42:08.959
You've been pretty wired lately,
you know you have.

42:08.960 --> 42:12.239
I think you've just gone out there
and got yourself a bit worked up.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.759
Worked up?

42:13.760 --> 42:15.040
It was dark and scary.

42:15.041 --> 42:18.240
Me? There's nothing wrong with me.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.680
Sherlock...

42:33.160 --> 42:37.280
Sherl... There is nothing wrong
with me! Do you understand!?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.880
You want me to prove it, yes?

42:43.920 --> 42:46.200
We're looking for a dog, yes?
A great big dog,

42:46.201 --> 42:48.479
that's your brilliant theory.
Cherchez le chien!

42:48.480 --> 42:50.999
Where shall we start?
How about them?

42:51.000 --> 42:54.159
The sentimental widow and her son,
the unemployed fisherman.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.420
The answer's yes. Yes?
She's got a West Highland

42:56.421 --> 42:58.679
Terrier called Whisky, not
what we're looking for!

42:58.680 --> 43:00.460
For God's sake!
Look at his jumper, hardly worn.

43:00.461 --> 43:02.239
Clearly he's uncomfortable.

43:02.240 --> 43:06.039
Could be the material or the hideous
pattern, suggests it's a present.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.679
He wants into his mother's
good books. Why? Probably money.

43:08.680 --> 43:11.359
He's treating her to a meal,
but his own portion is small.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.400
He wants to impress her,
but he's trying to

43:13.401 --> 43:15.439
economise on his own food.
Maybe he's not hungry.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.680
No, small plate, starter.
He's practically licked it clean.

43:17.681 --> 43:19.919
She's nearly finished
her pavlova.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.240
If she'd treated him,
he'd have had as much as he wanted.

43:22.241 --> 43:25.479
He's hungry and not well-off, you
can tell by his cuffs and shoes.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.199
Only a mother would give him
a Christmas present like that.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.079
It could be an aunt or older
sister, but mother's more likely.

43:31.080 --> 43:34.239
He was a fisherman, the scarring on
his hands is distinctive, fish hooks.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.599
They're old,
suggesting long-term unemployment.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.919
Not much industry here, so he's turned
to his widowed mother for help. Widowed?

43:39.920 --> 43:41.780
She's got a man's
wedding ring on a chain

43:41.781 --> 43:43.639
around her neck, clearly
her late husband's

43:43.640 --> 43:45.380
and too big for her finger.

43:45.381 --> 43:47.119
She's well-dressed, but
her jewellery is cheap.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.560
She could afford better,
but she's kept it, sentimental.

43:49.561 --> 43:52.639
The dog? There are tiny hairs on her
leg but none above the knees,

43:52.640 --> 43:55.199
suggesting it's a small dog,
probably a terrier.

43:55.200 --> 43:58.479
It is a West Highland Terrier called
Whisky. "How do you know that?"

43:58.480 --> 44:00.420
She was on the same
train as us and I heard

44:00.421 --> 44:02.359
her call its name.
That's listening.

44:02.360 --> 44:05.039
I use my senses, unlike some people,
so you see, I am fine.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.040
In fact, I've never been better,
so just leave me alone!

44:09.600 --> 44:11.560
Yeah, OK.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.480
OK.

44:16.080 --> 44:20.079
Why would you listen to me? I'm just
your friend. I don't have friends.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.560
No.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.720
I wonder why.

45:37.480 --> 45:41.360
Mr Selden,
you've done it again!

45:43.640 --> 45:45.999
I keep catching it with my belt.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.080
God!

46:03.080 --> 46:05.560
So?

46:20.880 --> 46:23.640
You're a bad man.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.960
That's so mean!

48:02.080 --> 48:06.039
More wine, doctor? Are you
trying to get me drunk, doctor?

48:06.040 --> 48:08.359
The thought never occurred.

48:08.360 --> 48:10.660
Because a while ago I thought
you were chatting me up.

48:10.661 --> 48:12.959
Where did I go wrong?

48:12.960 --> 48:14.900
When you started asking
about my patients.

48:14.901 --> 48:16.839
Well, I am one of
Henry's oldest friends.

48:16.840 --> 48:19.599
Yeah, and he's one of my
patients, so I can't talk about him.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.719
Although he has told me
about all his oldest friends.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.360
Which one are you? A new one?

48:26.800 --> 48:29.959
OK, what about his father?
He wasn't one of your patients.

48:29.960 --> 48:33.119
Wasn't he some sort of
conspiracy nutter... theorist?

48:33.120 --> 48:36.119
You're only a nutter if
you're wrong. And was he wrong?

48:36.120 --> 48:39.519
I should think so. But he got
fixated on Baskerville, didn't he?

48:39.520 --> 48:41.799
With what they were doing in there.

48:41.800 --> 48:45.239
Couldn't Henry have gone the
same way, started imagining a hound?

48:45.240 --> 48:47.319
Why do you think
I'll talk about this?

48:47.320 --> 48:51.999
Because I think you're worried about
him and because I'm a doctor too.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.600
And because I have another friend
who might be having the same problem.

49:05.520 --> 49:08.719
Dr Watson! Hi. Hello.

49:08.720 --> 49:12.159
How's the investigation going?
Hello.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.479
What, investigation?

49:13.480 --> 49:16.719
Didn't you know? Don't you read
the blog? Sherlock Holmes.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.799
It's... Sherlock who?

49:18.800 --> 49:20.999
Private detective. This is his PA.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.079
PA? Well, live-in PA. Perfect!

49:24.080 --> 49:25.399
Live-in..?

49:25.400 --> 49:28.119
This is Dr Mortimer,
Henry's therapist.

49:28.120 --> 49:31.599
Hello. Bob Frankland.

49:31.600 --> 49:35.279
Listen, tell Sherlock I've been
keeping an eye on Stapleton.

49:35.280 --> 49:37.719
Any time he wants a little chat.
All right?

49:43.040 --> 49:47.720
Why don't you buy him a drink?
I think he likes you.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.039
Morning!
How are you feeling?

50:11.040 --> 50:12.799
I...

50:12.800 --> 50:15.079
I didn't sleep very well.
That's a shame.

50:15.080 --> 50:17.840
Shall I make us some coffee?
Look, you've got damp!

50:39.560 --> 50:41.840
Listen, last night...

50:45.040 --> 50:47.319
Why did you say
you hadn't seen anything?

50:47.320 --> 50:50.519
I mean, I only saw the hound
for a minute, but... Hound?

50:50.520 --> 50:54.399
What? Why do you call it a hound?
Why a hound?

50:54.400 --> 50:56.519
Why? What do you mean?
It's odd, isn't it?

50:56.520 --> 50:58.599
It's a strange choice of words,
archaic.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.780
That's why I took the case.
"Mr Holmes, they

51:00.781 --> 51:02.959
were the footprints
of a gigantic hound."

51:02.960 --> 51:05.039
Why say "hound"?

51:05.040 --> 51:08.720
I don't know, I've never...

51:06.080 --> 51:08.720
Actually, I'd better skip
the coffee.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.359
Did you get anywhere
with that Morse code?

51:40.360 --> 51:41.679
Nah.

51:41.680 --> 51:45.879
U, M, Q, R, A, wasn't it? Umqra.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.799
Nothing. Qra...

51:47.800 --> 51:50.879
Look, forget it. I thought
I was onto something, I wasn't.

51:50.880 --> 51:52.559
Sure? Yeah.

51:52.560 --> 51:55.719
How about Louise Mortimer,
did you get anywhere with her? No.

51:55.720 --> 51:58.679
Too bad.
But did you get any information?

51:58.680 --> 52:00.239
You're being funny now?

52:00.240 --> 52:03.279
Thought it might break the ice,
a bit.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.919
Funny doesn't suit you.
Let's stick to ice.

52:06.920 --> 52:08.559
John... It's fine.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.740
Wait, something happened
to me last night,

52:10.741 --> 52:12.919
something I've not
experienced before.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.380
Yes, you said. Fear, Sherlock
Holmes got scared, you said.

52:15.381 --> 52:17.839
It was more than that, John.
It was doubt.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.439
I felt doubt.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.580
I've always been able
to trust my senses, the

52:21.581 --> 52:23.719
evidence of my own eyes,
until last night.

52:23.720 --> 52:26.220
You can't actually believe
that you saw some

52:26.221 --> 52:28.719
kind of monster?
No, I can't believe that.

52:28.720 --> 52:32.400
But I did see it,
so the question is, how? How?

52:33.800 --> 52:35.279
Yes.

52:35.280 --> 52:37.079
Yeah, right, good.

52:37.080 --> 52:41.080
So you've got something to
go on, then. Good luck with that.

52:42.880 --> 52:46.559
Listen, what I said before, John,
I meant it.

52:46.560 --> 52:49.239
I don't have friends.

52:49.240 --> 52:50.480
I've just got one.

52:55.320 --> 52:56.720
Right.

52:59.400 --> 53:00.440
John.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.919
John! You are amazing!
You are fantastic!

53:04.920 --> 53:07.159
Yes, all right,
you don't have to overdo it.

53:07.160 --> 53:09.760
You may not be the most
luminous of people, but as a

53:09.761 --> 53:12.359
- conductor of light, you are unbeatable.
- Cheers What?

53:12.360 --> 53:14.700
Some people who aren't
geniuses have an ability

53:14.701 --> 53:17.039
to stimulate it in others.
You were saying sorry.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.440
Don't spoil it. So what have I done
that's so bloody stimulating?

53:22.000 --> 53:23.039
Yeah?

53:23.040 --> 53:26.879
What if it's not a word,
what if it is individual letters?

53:26.880 --> 53:28.679
You think it's an acronym?

53:28.680 --> 53:30.600
Absolutely no idea, but...

53:33.000 --> 53:35.999
- What the hell are you doing here?!
- Nice to see you too

53:36.000 --> 53:39.039
I'm on holiday, would you believe?
No, I wouldn't.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.399
Hello, John. Greg.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.600
I heard you were in the area.
What are you up to?

53:42.601 --> 53:45.759
Are you after this Hound of Hell,
like on the telly?

53:45.760 --> 53:47.980
I'm waiting for an explanation,
Inspector, why are you here?

53:47.981 --> 53:50.199
I've told you, I'm on holiday.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.560
You're brown as a nut.
You're clearly just back

53:52.561 --> 53:54.919
from your holidays.
I fancied another one.

53:54.920 --> 53:58.399
This is Mycroft, isn't it?
Now, look... Of course it is.

53:58.400 --> 54:03.159
One mention of Baskerville and he sends
down my handler to spy on me, incognito.

54:03.160 --> 54:06.479
Is that why you're calling
yourself "Greg"? That's his name.

54:06.480 --> 54:09.519
Is it? Yes.
If you'd ever bothered to find out.

54:09.520 --> 54:10.960
Look, I'm not your handler.

54:10.961 --> 54:13.519
And I just don't do
what your brother tells me.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.879
Actually, you could be just the man
we want. Why?

54:16.880 --> 54:19.079
Well, I've not been idle, Sherlock.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.999
I think I might have found something.
Here.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.719
I didn't know if it was relevant.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.860
Starting to look
like it might be.

54:25.861 --> 54:27.999
That is an awful lot of meat
for a vegetarian restaurant.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.079
Excellent.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.680
A nice, scary inspector
from Scotland Yard, who

54:31.681 --> 54:34.279
can put in a few calls,
might come in very handy.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.560
Shop.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.639
What's this?

54:52.640 --> 54:55.159
Coffee. I made coffee.
You never make coffee.

54:55.160 --> 54:58.320
Don't you want it?
You don't have to keep apologising.

54:59.920 --> 55:01.160
Thanks.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.120
I don't take sugar.

55:13.400 --> 55:16.399
These records go back
nearly two months.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.079
That's nice. It's good.

55:18.080 --> 55:21.119
Is that when you had the idea,
after the TV show went out?

55:21.120 --> 55:24.039
It's me. It was me.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.159
I'm sorry, Gary. I couldn't help it.

55:27.160 --> 55:30.999
I had a bacon sandwich at Cal's wedding
and one thing led to another. Nice try.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.279
Look, we were just trying to give
things a bit of a boost, you know?

55:36.280 --> 55:40.119
Let a great big dog run wild up
on the moor, it was heaven-sent.

55:40.120 --> 55:42.799
It was like us
having our own Loch Ness monster.

55:42.800 --> 55:46.919
And where do you keep it? There's
an old mine shaft. It's not too far.

55:46.920 --> 55:50.079
He was all right there. Was?

55:50.080 --> 55:53.720
We couldn't control
the bloody thing. It was vicious.

55:54.760 --> 55:56.639
And then, a month ago,

55:56.640 --> 56:01.919
Billy took him to the vet
and, you know...

56:01.920 --> 56:03.080
He's dead?

56:04.240 --> 56:05.319
Put down.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.999
Yeah. No choice.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.679
So it's over.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.839
It was just a joke, you know.

56:11.840 --> 56:13.359
Yeah, hilarious

56:13.360 --> 56:17.120
You've nearly driven
a man out of his mind.

56:34.120 --> 56:38.119
You know he's actually pleased
you're here? Secretly pleased.

56:38.120 --> 56:39.559
Is he?

56:39.560 --> 56:41.199
That's nice.

56:41.200 --> 56:44.519
I suppose he likes having
all the same faces back together.

56:44.520 --> 56:48.199
Appeals to his... his...

56:48.200 --> 56:49.919
Asperger's?

56:49.920 --> 56:53.239
So, you believe them about having
the dog destroyed? No reason not to.

56:53.240 --> 56:55.479
Well, hopefully
there's no harm done.

56:55.480 --> 56:57.780
I'm not quite sure what I'd
charge them with, anyway.

56:57.781 --> 57:00.079
I'll have a word with
the local force.

57:00.080 --> 57:02.199
Right, that's that, then.
Catch you later.

57:02.200 --> 57:07.039
I'm enjoying this. It's nice
to get London out of your lungs.

57:07.040 --> 57:10.399
So that was their dog that people
saw out on the moor? Looks like it.

57:10.400 --> 57:13.479
But that wasn't what you saw,
that wasn't just an ordinary dog.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.680
No. It was immense.

57:14.681 --> 57:17.239
It had burning red eyes,
and it was glowing, John,

57:17.240 --> 57:20.400
its whole body was glowing.

57:22.120 --> 57:27.119
I've got a theory, but I need to get
back into Baskerville to test it.

57:27.120 --> 57:30.119
How? Can't pull off
the ID trick again.

57:30.120 --> 57:31.360
Might not have to.

57:32.880 --> 57:36.520
Hello, brother, dear. How ARE you?

58:01.440 --> 58:03.799
Afternoon, sir.
Can you turn the engine off?

58:03.800 --> 58:04.839
Thank you.

58:04.840 --> 58:07.439
I need to see Major Barrymore
as soon as we get inside.

58:07.440 --> 58:11.159
Right. Which means you'll have to
start the search for the hound. OK.

58:11.160 --> 58:12.599
In the labs.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.559
Stapleton's first.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.120
It could be dangerous.

58:30.400 --> 58:31.840
You know I'd love to

58:31.841 --> 58:35.119
I'd love to give you unlimited
access to this place. Why not?

58:35.120 --> 58:38.919
It's a simple enough request, Major.
I've never heard of anything so bizarre.

58:38.920 --> 58:43.799
You're to give me 24 hours, it's what
I negotiated, not a second more.

58:43.800 --> 58:47.039
I may have to comply with this
order, but I don't have to like it.

58:47.040 --> 58:49.140
I don't know what the hell you
expect to find here, anyway.

58:49.141 --> 58:51.239
Perhaps the truth. About what?

58:51.240 --> 58:53.479
I see.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.359
The big coat should have told me.

58:55.360 --> 58:58.439
You're one of the conspiracy lot,
aren't you?

58:58.440 --> 59:00.240
Well, then, go ahead, seek them out,

59:00.241 --> 59:03.959
the monsters, the death rays,
the aliens.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.079
Have you got any of those?

59:06.080 --> 59:07.480
Just wondering.

59:08.560 --> 59:12.599
A couple.
Crash landed here in the '60s.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.919
We call them Abbott and Costello.

59:14.920 --> 59:17.000
Good luck, Mr Holmes.

59:44.920 --> 59:47.599
God!

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.400
God!

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.280
Come on.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.840
Hello?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.439
No, come on. Come on.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.039
(No... Don't be ridiculous.)

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.519
(Pick up.)

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.000
Damn it.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.560
(Right.)

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.839
(It's here. It's in here with me.)

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.999
'Where are you?'

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.759
(Get me out, Sherlock,
you've got to get me out.)

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.320
(The big lab,
the first lab that we saw.)

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.719
'John... John?'

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.680
(Now, Sherlock! Please!)

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.359
'All right, I'll find you.
Keep talking.'

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.279
(I can't, it'll hear me.)

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.600
'Keep talking. What are you seeing?

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.919
'John?'

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.279
(Yes, I'm here.)

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.800
'What can you see?'

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.360
(I don't know. I don't know,
but I can hear it now.)

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.439
(Did you hear that?)

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.600
'Stay calm, stay calm.
Can you see it?

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.999
'Can you see it?'

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.599
(No, I can't.)

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.680
I can see it.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.560
(I can see it.)

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.680
(It's here.)

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.639
Are you all right? John?

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.159
Jesus Christ! It was the hound!

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.879
Sherlock, it was here, I swear it,
Sherlock, it must, it must...

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.079
Did-did you see it? You must have!

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.319
It's all right, it's OK now.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.039
NO, IT'S NOT! IT'S NOT OK!

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.519
I saw it, I was wrong!

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.439
Well, let's not jump
to conclusions. What?

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.759
What did you see? I told you, I saw
the hound? Huge, red eyes? Yes.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.919
Glowing? Yeah.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.359
No. What?

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.159
I made up the bit about glowing.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.799
You saw what you expected to see
because I told you.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.759
You have been drugged.
We have all been drugged. Drugged?

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.660
Can you walk?
Of course I can walk.

01:06:48.661 --> 01:06:50.560
Come on, then.
It's time to lay this ghost.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.239
Back again?
What's on your mind this time?

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.679
Murder, Dr Stapleton.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.720
Refined, cold-blooded murder.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.520
Will you tell little Kirsty what
happened to Bluebell, or shall I?

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.879
OK. What do you want?

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.920
Can I borrow your microscope?

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.439
Are you sure you're OK?
You look very peaky.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.960
No, I'm all right.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.879
It was the GFP gene from a jellyfish,
in case you're interested. What?

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.439
In the rabbits. Right, yeah.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.799
Aequorea victoria,
if you really want to know.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.319
Why? Why not?

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.239
We don't ask questions like that
here. It isn't done.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.079
It was a mix-up, anyway. My daughter
ended up with one of the lab specimens,

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.119
so poor Bluebell had to go.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.559
Your compassion is overwhelming!
I know.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.000
I hate myself sometimes.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.078
So, come on, then, you can trust me,
I'm a doctor,

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.879
what else have you got
hidden away up here?

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.238
Listen, if you can imagine it,

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.679
someone is probably doing it
somewhere. Of course they are.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.439
Cloning? Yes, of course.
Dolly the Sheep, remember?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.439
Human cloning? Why not?

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.399
And what about animals? Not sheep.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.959
Big animals.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.238
Size isn't a problem. Not at all.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.819
The only limits are
ethics and the law and

01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:49.399
both those things can
be very flexible.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:52.559
But not here, not at Baskerville.
It's not there!

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.479
Jesus! Nothing there!
It doesn't make any sense!

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:57.078
What were you expecting to find?

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.198
A drug, of course.
It has to be a drug.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.879
An hallucinogenic
or a deliriant of some kind.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.999
There's no trace of anything
in the sugar. Sugar? Sugar, yes.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.580
A simple process of elimination.
I saw the hound,

01:09:07.581 --> 01:09:10.158
saw it as my imagination
expected me to see it.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.999
A genetically engineered monster.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.559
I knew I couldn't believe my eyes, so
there were seven possible reasons,

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.999
the most possible being narcotics.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.839
Henry Knight, he saw it too, but
you didn't, John. You didn't see it.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.859
We have eaten and drunk
the same things since

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.879
we got to Grimpen,
apart from one thing.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.158
You don't take sugar in your coffee.
I see, so?

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.999
I took it from Henry's kitchen,
his sugar.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.999
It's perfectly all right.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.359
But maybe it's not a drug.
No, it has to be a drug.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:43.080
How did it get into our systems?
How?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.999
There has to be something,
something...

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.800
Something...

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.479
Something buried deep.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.999
Get out. What?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.160
Get out, I need to go to
my mind palace. Your what?

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.839
He's not going to be doing much talking
for a while, we may as well go.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.319
His what? His "mind palace".

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.639
It's a memory technique,
a sort of mental map.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.879
You plot a map with a location,
it doesn't have to be a real place.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.439
You deposit memories there.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.380
Theoretically, you
never forget anything.

01:10:20.381 --> 01:10:22.319
All you do is find
your way back to it.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.799
So this imaginary location could be
anything, a house or a street? Yeah.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.680
But he said "palace", he
said it was a palace?

01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:29.560
Yeah, well, he would,
wouldn't he?

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.920
# You ain't nothing... #

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.240
Hound.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.439
My god!

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:05.760
My god! My god! I am so...
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.199
John? Yeah, I'm on it.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:30.599
Project HOUND. I must have
read about it, stored it away.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.599
An experiment in
a CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.880
H-O-U-N-D.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.879
That's as far as my access goes,
I'm afraid.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.879
There must be an override,
a password?

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.160
I imagine so,
but that'd be Major Barrymore's.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.679
Password, password. Password.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.680
He sat here when he thought it up.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.919
Describe him to me? You've seen him.
But describe him.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.759
He's a bloody martinet, a throw-back,
the sort they'd have sent into Suez.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.340
Good, excellent, old-fashioned.
Traditionalist.

01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:16.919
Not the sort to use his
children's name as a password.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.719
He loves his job, proud of it and this
is work-related. So what's at eye level?

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.359
Books.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.399
Jane's Defence Weekly, bound copies.
Hannibal.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.880
Wellington. Rommel.
Churchill's History of the

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:30.359
English-Speaking Peoples,
all four volumes.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.439
Churchill, he's fond of Churchill.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.420
Copy of The Downing Street
Years, one to five.

01:13:35.421 --> 01:13:37.399
Separate biographies
of Thatcher.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.439
Mid-1980s, at a guess.
Father and son.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.740
Barrymore Senior, medals,
Distinguished Service Order.

01:13:42.741 --> 01:13:45.039
That date, I'd say
Falklands veteran.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.839
Right, Thatcher's a more likely bet
than Churchill. That's the password?

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.400
No! With a man like Major Barrymore,
only first name terms would do.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.279
Hound.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.720
Jesus.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.120
Project HOUND.
A new deliriant drug which

01:14:50.121 --> 01:14:53.279
rendered its users
incredibly suggestible.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.580
They wanted to use it
as an anti-personnel

01:14:55.581 --> 01:14:57.879
weapon, to totally
disorientate the enemy

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.000
using fear and stimulus.

01:15:00.001 --> 01:15:02.119
But they shut it down and
hid it away in 1986.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.140
Because of what it did to the
subjects they tested it on.

01:15:04.141 --> 01:15:06.159
And what they did to others.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.640
Prolonged exposure
drove them insane.

01:15:08.641 --> 01:15:11.119
Made them almost
uncontrollably aggressive.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.799
So, someone's been doing it again?
Carrying on the experiments?

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.359
Attempting to refine it, perhaps.
For the last 20 years. Who?

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.839
Those names mean anything to you?

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.799
No, not a thing.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.839
Five principal scientists.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.600
20 years ago.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.079
Maybe our friend's somewhere
in the back of the picture?

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.400
Someone old enough to be there at
the time of the experiments in 1986?

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.480
Maybe somebody who says
"cell phone" because of

01:15:41.481 --> 01:15:44.439
time spent in America?
You remember, John? -mm.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.319
Here's my, cell number.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.679
He gave us his number,
in case we needed him.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.679
My god, Bob Frankland.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.460
But Bob doesn't work on...
He's a virologist.

01:15:52.461 --> 01:15:54.239
This is chemical warfare.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.479
That's where he started, though.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.180
He's never lost the
certainty, the obsession

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:02.879
that that drug
really could work.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.400
Nice of him to give us his number.
Let's arrange a little meeting.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.319
Hello?

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.999
Who's this? You've got to find Henry.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.919
It's Louise Mortimer.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.359
Louise, what's wrong?

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.640
Henry was, was remembering. Then...

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.559
He tried...

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.039
He's got a gun, he went
for the gun and tried to... What?

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.519
He's gone. But you've got to stop
him, I don't know what he might do.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.559
Where, where are you?

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.559
His house. I'm OK. I'm OK.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.479
Right, stay there.
We'll get someone to you, OK?

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.399
Henry? He's attacked her. Gone?

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.079
There's only one place he'll go,
back to where it started.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.040
Lestrade? Get to the Hollow. Dewer's
Hollow, now! And bring a gun.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.440
I'm sorry.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.840
I'm so sorry, Dad.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.599
No, Henry, no, no! Get back!

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.879
Get away from me!
Easy, Henry, easy. Just relax.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.599
I know what I am,
I know what I tried to do.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.159
Just put the gun down, it's OK.
No, no! I know what I am!

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.759
Yes, I'm sure you do, Henry.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.999
It's all been explained to you,
hasn't it?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.919
Explained very carefully. What?

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.559
Someone needed to keep you quiet,

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.999
needed to keep you as a child, to
reassert the dream you both clung on to,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.839
because you had started to remember.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.780
Remember now, Henry,
you've got to remember

01:18:26.781 --> 01:18:29.719
what happened here when
you were a little boy.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.599
I thought it had got my dad.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.319
The hound. I thought... Jesus!

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.399
I don't... I don't know any more!
I don't!

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.540
No, Henry!
Henry, for God's sake!

01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:43.679
Henry, remember.
"Liberty In." Two words.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.000
Two words a frightened little
boy saw here 20 years ago.

01:18:46.001 --> 01:18:48.319
You'd started to piece
things together.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.999
Remember what happened here
that night.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.439
It wasn't an animal, was it, Henry?

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.600
Not a monster.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.400
A man.

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.079
You couldn't cope.
You were just a child.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.119
So you rationalised it
into something very different.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.159
Then you started to remember,
so you had to be stopped.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.199
Driven out of your mind so that no-one
would believe a word that you said.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.639
Sherlock!

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.399
It's OK.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.519
It's OK, mate.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.719
But we saw it, the hound,
last night. We did, we s...

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.359
No, but there was a dog, Henry,

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.479
leaving footprints, scaring witnesses,
but nothing more than an ordinary dog.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.239
We both saw it, saw it as our
drugged minds wanted us to see it.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.640
Fear and stimulus,
that's how it works.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.559
But there never was any monster.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.039
Sherlock?

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.679
No! No, no, no, no!
Henry, Henry... Sherlock!

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.399
No, no! No, no, no, noooo!

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.920
Henry.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.719
Sherlock, are you seeing this?

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.620
Right, he is not drugged,
Sherlock, so what's that?

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:45.519
No! What is it?!

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.119
All right, it's still here.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.359
But it's just a dog, Henry. It's
nothing more than an ordinary dog.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.439
My god!

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.600
Christ!

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.280
No. No!

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.759
It's not you, not you!

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.960
.. Urgh...

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.559
The fog. What? It's the fog,
the drug, it's in the fog!

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.620
Aerosol dispersant, that's
what it said in the records.

01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:39.679
Project HOUND, it's the fog!

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.479
A chemical minefield.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.879
For God's sake, kill it! Kill it!

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.919
Look at it, Henry.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.160
No, no, no. Come on, look at it!

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.519
You bastard.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:14.119
You... bastard!

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.040
20 years! 20 years of my
life, making no sense!

01:22:16.041 --> 01:22:17.959
It's all over now, come on.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.919
Why didn't you just kill me?

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.519
Because dead men get listened to,
he needed to do more than kill you.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:26.839
He had to discredit every word
you ever said about your father.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.399
And he had the means
right at his feet.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:33.239
A chemical minefield,
pressure pads in the ground,

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.759
dosing you up every time
that you came back here.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.279
Murder weapon
and scene of the crime all at once.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.359
This case, Henry.
Thank you.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.440
It's been brilliant! Sherlock. What?

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.000
Timing.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.639
Not good? No, no, it's OK.

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.519
It's fine. Because this means...

01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.199
this means that my dad was right.

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.679
He'd found something out, hadn't he?

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:06.959
And that's why you killed him,
because he was right,

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:13.119
and he'd found you right
in the middle of an experiment!

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.720
Frankland!

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.760
Frankland! Keep running.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.039
Come on, keep up!

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.040
It's no use, Frankland.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.640
Thanks, Bill.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.039
So they didn't have it put down
then, the dog? Obviously.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.079
I suppose they just couldn't
bring themselves to do it.

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.480
I see.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.000
No, you don't.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.880
No, I don't. Sentiment? Sentiment.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.360
Listen, what happened to me
in the lab?

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.639
Do you want some sauce with that?

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.860
I hadn't been to the Hollow.
How come I heard

01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:08.079
those things there?
Fear and stimulus, you said?

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.159
You must have been dosed with it
elsewhere. In the lab, maybe?

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.999
You saw those pipes,
pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.559
And they were carrying the gas, so...
Ketchup was it, or brown? Hang on.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.999
You thought it was in the sugar. You
were convinced it was in the sugar.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I'd better get going,
there's a train

01:25:24.001 --> 01:25:25.999
leaving in half an hour,
so if you want...

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.839
God! It was you.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.319
You locked me in that bloody lab.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.839
I had to, it was an experiment.
An experiment?! Ssh.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.320
I was terrified, scared to death!
I thought the drug

01:25:37.321 --> 01:25:39.799
was in the sugar, so I
put some in your coffee.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.480
Then I arranged everything
with Major Barrymore.

01:25:42.481 --> 01:25:45.160
Totally scientific, laboratory
conditions, literally.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:54.439
(It's in here with me.) All right,
keep talking, I'll find you.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.399
Keep talking. (I can't, it'll hear
me.) Tell me what you're seeing.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.279
I don't know, but I can hear it now.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.020
I knew what effect it
had had on a superior

01:26:07.021 --> 01:26:09.759
mind, so I needed to try
it on an average one.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.359
You know what I mean.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.159
But it wasn't in the sugar. No, well,

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.560
I wasn't to know you'd already
been exposed to the gas.

01:26:18.561 --> 01:26:20.959
So you got it wrong. No.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.200
You were wrong. It wasn't in
the sugar, you got it wrong. A bit.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.440
It won't happen again.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.079
Any long-term effects?

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.160
None at all. You'll be fine once
you've excreted it. We all will.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.280
I think I might have taken care
of that already.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.080
Where are you going?
I won't be a minute.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.640
Got to see a man about a dog.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.400
All right, let him go.
