00:04.768 --> 00:06.533
I missed ya, girl.

00:06.621 --> 00:09.132
The <i> Cloudslayer</i>
flies again!

00:09.220 --> 00:12.851
<i>Cloudslayer?</i> That is way
better than the <i>Sunchaser.</i>

00:12.939 --> 00:17.095
Whoo! Why would Huey and Louie
want to miss thi-i-is?

00:18.056 --> 00:20.815
- I think I may have some idea.
- Their loss.

00:20.902 --> 00:25.524
Dewey and Della Duck on their
first high-flying adventure!

00:25.720 --> 00:28.999
Not "adventure."
Business venture.

00:29.087 --> 00:31.069
We are headed to Boarway,

00:31.157 --> 00:34.390
home of the Von Drake
Doomsday Vault!

00:34.478 --> 00:36.531
Ooh!

00:36.618 --> 00:39.337
- A sterile seed depository.
- Meh.

00:39.603 --> 00:42.179
My old colleague
Ludwig Von Drake

00:42.267 --> 00:46.350
collected millions of seeds for
safekeeping in case of apocalypse.

00:46.438 --> 00:50.249
Unfortunately, the vault's been
damaged by melting permafrost.

00:50.337 --> 00:51.892
We must convince the owners

00:51.980 --> 00:55.397
to hire McDuck Bin Securities
to fix it.

00:55.617 --> 00:58.633
If we manage to get there
in one piece.

00:58.845 --> 01:01.907
Please, Uncle Scrooge. I've been
flying since before Donald could walk.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.277
Och, fine.
You know what you're do...

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:15.195 --> 01:18.945

01:24.304 --> 01:27.853

02:30.169 --> 02:32.056
<i> The noble seed.</i>

02:32.144 --> 02:34.585
Our hope for
a better tomorrow.

02:34.673 --> 02:38.690
Carefully tended, a seed
will sprout with promise.

02:38.778 --> 02:40.837
That's what your father,
Ludwig, wanted for you...

02:40.925 --> 02:44.782
what any parent wants for their
child really... -

02:44.870 --> 02:46.851
to see them thrive in the face

02:46.939 --> 02:48.554
of an uncertain tomorrow.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.893
In that vault
lies everything

02:50.981 --> 02:54.295
the world needs to survive
a doomsday scenario:

02:54.383 --> 02:56.110
food, water, shelter,

02:56.198 --> 02:58.480
poison darts,
vampire antitoxin,

02:58.568 --> 03:03.281
and... the fabled Money Tree
of Aurum Oros.

03:03.470 --> 03:05.914
- Oh!
- Money tree?

03:06.002 --> 03:08.186
Owlson, why didn't you tell me
there was a money tree?

03:08.274 --> 03:11.557
It was one of several points in the
presentation I prepared for you,

03:11.644 --> 03:13.826
which I'm now realizing
you didn't read.

03:13.913 --> 03:15.228
Great.

03:15.315 --> 03:19.211
The money tree is the most
venerated of vegetation.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.848
To gaze upon
even its seed

03:21.936 --> 03:25.552
- is to know the true meaning of wonder.
- Ah!

03:25.676 --> 03:27.656
I swear to lock them up
so tight

03:27.744 --> 03:31.194
that nothing will ever touch those
seeds until the end of the world.

03:31.547 --> 03:33.610
Aw.

03:33.698 --> 03:34.930
Mm!

03:37.860 --> 03:39.337
We've got to see
those money tree seeds

03:39.424 --> 03:40.743
before Scrooge
locks them up forever!

03:40.830 --> 03:42.512
Jinx! Double jinx!

03:42.647 --> 03:45.235
My son, literally
running toward adventure.

03:45.323 --> 03:48.117
I've never been more proud
than this moment.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.336
Race ya to the <i> Cloudslayer!</i>

03:58.925 --> 04:02.275
The Doomsday Vault
is the key to our future.

04:02.362 --> 04:04.938
So far, so good.

04:05.201 --> 04:08.918
A future in which I make
more money than McDuck,

04:09.006 --> 04:12.222
win our bet,
and win his company!

04:12.410 --> 04:14.391
Here's where you come in.

04:17.209 --> 04:19.860
I break into the vault,
grab the money tree,

04:19.947 --> 04:21.797
we split the profits 90/10,

04:21.885 --> 04:24.048
then I blow up the vault
to cover our tracks!

04:25.351 --> 04:27.700
What he means is,

04:27.787 --> 04:31.121
we will respectfully blow
your minds

04:31.209 --> 04:33.777
with how secure
we'll make that vault,

04:33.865 --> 04:35.465
- for half the price.
- Uh-huh.

04:35.553 --> 04:37.242
And if you don't
give us the job,

04:37.330 --> 04:40.079
I'm just gonna steal
the tree anyway, so-o-o...

04:42.768 --> 04:46.084
So sorry, everyone.
Deepest apologies.

04:46.172 --> 04:47.941
I can't believe he lost us
another contract.

04:48.029 --> 04:51.790
Congratulations, Mr. McDuck.
You have the job there.

04:52.967 --> 04:56.084
No more cockamamie ploys!

04:56.443 --> 04:57.924
Cockamamie ploy?

04:58.012 --> 04:59.931
That was clearly
a maniacal scheme.

05:00.019 --> 05:01.896
How long have you
worked for me?

05:01.984 --> 05:04.650
I don't work for you! I am
the only one who keeps you

05:04.738 --> 05:07.405
from ruining this company
with your brainless plots!

05:08.327 --> 05:09.708

05:13.373 --> 05:15.348
Better luck next time,

05:15.435 --> 05:17.381
See you back in Duckburg.

05:19.025 --> 05:22.074
Uh, where is my plane?

05:22.310 --> 05:24.115

Keep going.

05:46.266 --> 05:48.281
When I was stuck on the moon,
all I thought about

05:48.368 --> 05:49.748
was teaching you
how to adventure.

05:49.836 --> 05:52.396
Well, that and avoiding
horrifying moon monsters.

05:52.779 --> 05:55.021
But you're already

Copilot to pilot,
we're a go for, um, uh,

06:00.046 --> 06:01.561
flying, I guess?

06:01.648 --> 06:03.514
Copilot? No way.

06:03.602 --> 06:06.185
You're pilot material, buddy.
Take the stick!

06:06.389 --> 06:09.998
Me, fly the <i> Suncha...</i>
I mean,<i> Cloudslayer?</i>

06:10.086 --> 06:12.451
Scrooge won't even let me
touch the toaster.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.121
You're my kid.
You can do anything.

06:15.289 --> 06:18.123
You are the best mom!

06:27.148 --> 06:29.448
Now, close your eyes.

06:32.022 --> 06:33.683
Feel the sky.

06:38.576 --> 06:41.058
I'm doing it.
I'm Dewey-ing...

06:52.165 --> 06:54.213
I am so sorry.

06:54.503 --> 06:56.854
For what?
That was a perfect first try.

06:56.942 --> 06:59.091
I'm so proud of you,
Dewey.

06:59.518 --> 07:01.384
To adventure!

07:08.726 --> 07:11.342
So, you want to do this
the easy way...

07:11.538 --> 07:12.807
or the fun way?

07:12.895 --> 07:15.344
I am offended
you had to ask.

07:15.862 --> 07:18.137
Easy, Beakley.
Della wouldn't just

07:18.224 --> 07:20.729
steal an aircraft
and set out on a whim.

07:20.852 --> 07:22.674
Oh, you know,
except for that one time.

07:22.762 --> 07:24.916
But she's matured,
and I'll just...

07:25.130 --> 07:27.712
- What in the blazes?
- Aha! Capture Scrooge,

07:27.800 --> 07:30.612
force him to get me to the
vault, steal the money tree.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.949
Brilliant scheming,
Glomgold.

07:34.971 --> 07:38.275
Beakley, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

07:42.885 --> 07:46.299
Oh, well, seems I'm headed
to the vault anyway.

07:46.387 --> 07:48.002
Might as well
take your plane.

07:48.090 --> 07:49.799
Oh, Owlson took my plane.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.802
I captured you
so I could take yours.

07:57.549 --> 07:59.779
Looks like we're walking.

07:59.866 --> 08:01.651
With no gear, no supplies?

08:01.739 --> 08:04.555
You want to march blindly,
without thinking? Uh...

08:04.643 --> 08:07.244
I forgot who I was talking to.

08:07.332 --> 08:09.448
Let's go back to base camp.
We need to prepare.

08:09.536 --> 08:11.702
I know where I'm going!

08:19.244 --> 08:21.119
You're on thin ice, Glomgold.

08:21.207 --> 08:22.840
I don't have to listen
to you, McDuck.

08:22.928 --> 08:25.804
No, you are
literally on...

08:31.789 --> 08:34.331
All part of the scheme!

08:39.938 --> 08:42.706
Money tree, here we come!

08:48.300 --> 08:49.862
I can't stop laughing!

08:59.738 --> 09:00.995
Pretty weird way

09:01.083 --> 09:03.083
to build a bridge.

09:04.359 --> 09:06.779
Dewey, honey, I don't think they
built it with a big hole in it.

09:06.866 --> 09:08.594
It must've been torn apart
when the ice melted

09:08.681 --> 09:10.300
and this
crevice widened.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.363
<i>Welcome, survivors.</i>

12:08.714 --> 12:10.996
<i>because
here comes the one.</i>

12:11.113 --> 12:14.263
No rush, honey!
You're doing great!

12:14.351 --> 12:17.133
<i>One quarter.
One eighth.</i>

12:17.221 --> 12:18.769
Not helping!

12:24.671 --> 12:29.121
<i>See? Now, that wasn't
so hard at all.</i>

12:32.004 --> 12:35.293
You're alive?
Oh, you're alive!

12:35.538 --> 12:38.821
Whoo! I was inches from death,
terrified, then boom!

12:38.923 --> 12:41.981
You pulled it out at the last
second for maximum tension!

12:42.113 --> 12:43.929
Uh-huh.

12:44.016 --> 12:47.613
What else will Dewey and Della conquer
together in the forbidden vault?

12:47.701 --> 12:50.134
Yetis?
Escaped lab experiments?

12:50.222 --> 12:54.106
Bacteria that will strip the very
flesh from our bones? Let's find out!

12:54.193 --> 12:56.527
Yeah. Let's Dewey it.

13:00.836 --> 13:04.086
I'm freezin'
me tail feathers off!

13:04.731 --> 13:07.699
What would the kids want
in the seed vault?

13:07.809 --> 13:10.660
Besides the opportunity
to inconvenience me?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.663
Ech! The sooner
we find them,

13:12.751 --> 13:14.666
the sooner
I can be rid of you.

13:14.754 --> 13:17.559
Oh, what the crebbins
is this mess?

13:17.647 --> 13:21.464
It's gonna cost me thousands to
replace these mangled mechanisms.

13:21.552 --> 13:24.101
It's fine,
as long as they're safe.

13:24.249 --> 13:25.754
Let's press forward.

13:25.842 --> 13:28.057
Hang on.
I'm dryin' off by the fire.

13:28.327 --> 13:29.457
Fire?

13:31.286 --> 13:34.809
I cannae turn my back for one second!
We've gotta move!

13:34.897 --> 13:37.998
Fine. I'll dry off quicker.

13:56.425 --> 14:00.008
<i>Welcome to my doomsday
seed vault...</i>

14:00.173 --> 14:01.496
- Cool!
- Oh, wow!

14:01.584 --> 14:04.293
<i>...encompassing
all the entirety</i>

14:04.381 --> 14:06.458
<i>of plant life
on this planet,</i>

14:06.546 --> 14:09.864
<i>including some very rare
and mythological plants.</i>

14:10.184 --> 14:13.052
<i>I have treated each
and every little seed</i>

14:13.139 --> 14:16.856
<i>with my Von Drake Super-growth
formula... patent pending...</i>

14:16.944 --> 14:18.856
<i>So you don't starve to death</i>

14:18.944 --> 14:21.574
<i>while you're waiting
for your crops to grow.</i>

14:23.115 --> 14:25.130
<i>It will cause them to grow</i>

14:25.217 --> 14:26.999
<i>at immense rates.</i>

14:27.095 --> 14:28.730
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

14:28.983 --> 14:31.899
<i>I wouldn't plant them
within a mile of each other,</i>

14:31.987 --> 14:34.114
<i>for safety reasons.</i>

14:37.455 --> 14:40.349
So which one of these boxes
are the money tree seeds in?

14:45.271 --> 14:47.971
Right...

14:50.776 --> 14:52.676
...there.

14:56.916 --> 14:59.750
Boy, it's a good thing we've got
this giant arm to help out.

15:02.975 --> 15:05.525
Ah, phooey! Come on!

15:05.791 --> 15:08.417
Ya worthless
hunk of junk! Ow!

15:08.505 --> 15:11.521
Sorry, kid. Looks like we came
all this way for nothing.

15:11.683 --> 15:14.378
So much for our first great
adventure together.

15:18.437 --> 15:22.237
If I don't make it, tell my
brothers I was the best one!

15:24.210 --> 15:27.092
Whoa!

15:27.179 --> 15:29.680
Yeah!

15:34.479 --> 15:37.202
Okay, just boulder up those
lockers like a rock wall.

15:37.290 --> 15:41.059
Then once you have a seed, base-jump
back to the platform, and...

15:43.662 --> 15:45.221
Wait. Is this crazy?

15:45.309 --> 15:47.658
Crazy is my middle name!

15:47.967 --> 15:49.073
Are you sure?

15:49.161 --> 15:51.416
No, it's...
it's actually Dingus.

15:51.537 --> 15:52.713
Ew, really?

15:52.801 --> 15:54.823
No, I mean
it's pretty dangerous.

15:54.911 --> 15:57.027
I can do this part
if you want.

15:57.243 --> 15:59.846
Mom, relax.
I'm your son.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.690
I can Dewey it.
I can do anything,

16:02.778 --> 16:04.596
just like you told me!

16:05.786 --> 16:09.010
Of course you can,
my little hero!

16:13.800 --> 16:15.133
Huh?

16:28.340 --> 16:30.455
I made it!

16:30.542 --> 16:32.157
Of course you did!

16:37.182 --> 16:39.968
So beautiful!
So worth it!

16:40.056 --> 16:42.056
I knew you could...

16:46.125 --> 16:48.507
- Oops.
- Aah!

16:57.603 --> 17:00.009
This is all
your fault, Scrooge!

17:00.220 --> 17:02.435
You shackled us together!
You poured gasoline

17:02.523 --> 17:04.438
on the fire with no sense
of consequence!

17:04.531 --> 17:06.165
What was I supposed to do?

17:06.327 --> 17:09.315
Make me...
not do that?

17:09.424 --> 17:11.338
<i>Oh, I notice
the room is on fire.</i>

17:11.425 --> 17:13.729
<i>I will activate
the sprinklers.</i>

17:13.817 --> 17:15.632
Blast! Frozen!

17:15.720 --> 17:18.143
<i>And to preserve
the seeds of humanity,</i>

17:18.246 --> 17:21.229
<i>I will hereby
seal off the room!</i>

17:23.665 --> 17:25.377
Perfect!

17:28.300 --> 17:30.315
Aah! Save me, Scrooge!

17:30.402 --> 17:32.541
Okay, calm down.

17:32.629 --> 17:34.318
Just need to open
the door using

17:34.406 --> 17:36.557
the panel,
which the children broke.

17:36.645 --> 17:38.794
So, we simply climb out
that vent...

17:38.882 --> 17:41.698
that has also been compromised by
Della and Dewey's senseless actions.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.980
Or for good reasons. Don't want
to jump to any conclusions.

17:44.067 --> 17:45.915
The most pressing matter
is the fire.

17:46.003 --> 17:48.019
So, we just need to
activate the sprink...

17:49.645 --> 17:52.203
Can you never think
anything through, Della?

17:52.291 --> 17:54.711
It's been over a decade,

17:54.799 --> 17:56.906
and she's still the same
headstrong kid,

17:56.994 --> 17:58.749
jumping blindly
into danger

17:58.837 --> 18:00.796
or space
or any other disaster

18:00.884 --> 18:03.515
without a thought to the
damage she leaves behind!

18:03.602 --> 18:06.118
Whoa.
You've got, like,

18:06.205 --> 18:10.040
your own whole personal thing
going on there.

18:23.884 --> 18:25.065
Move!

18:25.153 --> 18:27.259
Great.
Now I'm cold again.

18:35.439 --> 18:37.282
Dewey, are you okay?

18:37.369 --> 18:38.658
I got this, Mom!

18:38.746 --> 18:40.845
Totally under control!
Do not worry!

18:40.933 --> 18:42.581
Kids!

18:42.926 --> 18:45.942
Oh. They were after the tree.
That makes sense.

18:46.030 --> 18:49.393
You were running a
counter-scheme this whole time!

18:49.481 --> 18:53.845
Send your family ahead while
you slow down old Glommy, eh?

18:54.151 --> 18:55.766
That's my money tree!

18:55.854 --> 18:57.810
I don't care about
the stupid tree.

18:57.898 --> 18:59.796
My family is in danger!

18:59.884 --> 19:03.523
When you abduct me, you can
decide what's important!

19:03.611 --> 19:05.513
Okay, just get
some momentum going,

19:05.601 --> 19:07.609
then swing yourself out
onto that nearest branch.

19:07.697 --> 19:09.012
You can do it!

19:13.969 --> 19:16.140
I can't! I can't do it!

19:16.429 --> 19:18.662
Mo-o-om!

19:22.137 --> 19:23.320
I got you.

19:24.616 --> 19:25.828
I've always got you.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.937
Give me that! And that!
Hey, no touching!

19:37.242 --> 19:40.914
Ah, that's better.
And you two!

19:41.037 --> 19:43.437
Uncle Scrooge,
I can explain.

19:45.248 --> 19:47.163
Explain what?

19:47.251 --> 19:50.000
That you stole my plane,
put us all in danger,

19:50.088 --> 19:52.586
oh, and destroyed
humanity's only hope

19:52.674 --> 19:54.589
for surviving
the end of the world?

19:54.677 --> 19:58.195
Did you ever think of how you
were gonna get out of this? Hmm?

20:01.242 --> 20:02.672
Simple. We jump.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.176
Oh, no, you don't!
No more jumping headfirst into...

20:05.264 --> 20:06.757
Trust me.

20:07.615 --> 20:10.283
We can do this.
I got you.

20:13.325 --> 20:15.257
Now!

20:28.004 --> 20:29.961
I thought
we'd leave through here.

20:30.049 --> 20:31.961
- How did you...
- What?

20:32.049 --> 20:34.607
You gave a whole big presentation
with a map. I paid attention.

20:34.695 --> 20:36.229
When you're stuck in space
for 10 years,

20:36.316 --> 20:37.997
you pay attention
to exit strategies.

20:45.697 --> 20:47.968
Dewey!

20:48.467 --> 20:50.711
I'm sorry, Mom.
I let you down.

20:50.799 --> 20:52.914
I'm not the adventurer
you hoped I'd be.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.817
No, honey.

20:54.911 --> 20:57.760
I will always believe
you can do anything,

20:57.973 --> 21:01.208
but you never have to
prove anything to me.

21:02.589 --> 21:05.220
Oh, how am
I gonna fix this?

21:05.308 --> 21:07.390
You cannae!
You failed, McDuck!

21:07.486 --> 21:11.187
Now the Von Drakes are going to fire
you, give me the job, and then...

21:11.275 --> 21:13.423
I may have a way
out of this mess.

21:23.508 --> 21:25.423
Learned a lot about
welding gold on the moon.

21:25.589 --> 21:27.651
It's a right
bonny bin.

21:27.739 --> 21:30.024
And since the gold came
from the money tree,

21:30.137 --> 21:32.919
you saved me millions
in construction costs.

21:33.007 --> 21:35.682
And we harvested enough seeds
to double what they had in...

21:37.170 --> 21:40.220
I'm just gonna let someone else
put these seeds back.

21:40.719 --> 21:42.601
But who's got all the money?

21:42.688 --> 21:44.086
Glomgold does!

21:44.174 --> 21:47.257
Prepare to lose our bet
<i>and</i> your company!

21:49.681 --> 21:54.602
Uh... No!
Curse you, gentle breeze!

21:54.690 --> 21:56.196
Aah!
