It's Jennifer.
She's been taken.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.737
Jennifer was kidnapped
by guards working for a man

14:04.770 --> 14:06.761
named Marko Jankowics.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.005
I didn't realize
you and Jennifer

14:10.050 --> 14:11.608
were still in contact.
We're not.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.242
I hadn't heard
from her in months,

14:13.280 --> 14:15.748
and then she called me
last night, crying.

14:15.780 --> 14:17.782
I could barely understand
what she was saying,

14:17.820 --> 14:20.618
something about being scared
and on the run.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.379
From a drug dealer
like Sarkany?

14:24.830 --> 14:27.594
Does Jennifer use drugs?
I don't know.

14:27.630 --> 14:30.690
She said she was stranded
in Federal Hill in Baltimore.

14:30.730 --> 14:33.563
She hadn't
even started thanking me
for picking her up,

14:33.600 --> 14:36.865
and SUVS blocked my car
and two armed guards got out.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.537
I killed one,

14:38.570 --> 14:41.676
but by the time I had,
Jennifer was gone.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.678
And the print
from the guard I Shot

14:43.710 --> 14:46.975
showed that he was muscle
for Jankowics.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.779
What are you
not telling me?

14:50.820 --> 14:53.357
Nothing.
That's all I know.

14:55.220 --> 14:59.828
Sarkany is an Eastern European
purveyor of LSD.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.294
Even if She was
uSIng somethIng,

15:02.330 --> 15:04.594
Jennifer would not be worth
the time and effort

15:04.630 --> 15:05.961
to get nabbed.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.696
There must be more
to the story.

where to find him,
