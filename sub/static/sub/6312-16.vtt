WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:06.729
Subject is a 54-year-old
Caucasian male,

00:06.770 --> 00:09.068
moderately overweight.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.738
The hair on the left side of
the head is mated with blood,

00:11.770 --> 00:14.330
but there are no apparent
external wounds.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.245
Because he was stabbed
through the ear.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.112
Ice pick?

00:19.150 --> 00:21.209
Stiletto knife.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.389
The assailant was right-handed,
shorter than the victim,

00:23.420 --> 00:24.546
probably a woman.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.615
The victim knew her

00:26.660 --> 00:28.480
or was at least comfortable
enough With her

00:28.520 --> 00:30.351
to let his guard down.

00:30.390 --> 00:33.496
You_here for a reason
or Just to show off?

00:33.530 --> 00:34.792
I'm here about the Gupta case.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.764
Watson and I believe
we've identified

00:36.800 --> 00:39.496
the individual who murdered him.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.567
Trouble is, the DNA evidence
doesn't match our suspect.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.703
Or anyone else
in Mr. Gupta's life.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.800
There's no way anyone
but the killer left that sample.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.377
I agree. It's the only thing
that makes sense.

00:51.410 --> 00:54.516
So I did a little digging
and I found the DNA's source.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.142
Great.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.589
Who was it?
You.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.680
You are the killer,
according to the evidence.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.649
Got a sample of your DNA
from a discarded water bottle.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.523
An outside lab compared that
to the test results

01:08.560 --> 01:10.699
from the sample
found on the body.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.391
Perfect match.

01:16.770 --> 01:19.603
I contaminated the sample
with my own DNA.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.505
Obviously it was a mistake.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.303
These things happen
from time to time.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.545
Never on my watch.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.276
Can you still
close the case?

01:28.320 --> 01:31.778
We have enough evidence to put
the true culprit away for life.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.811
But the contaminated DNA test

01:33.860 --> 01:35.782
will complicate things
for the prosecutor.

01:35.820 --> 01:40.154
They're gonna want me to
testify, explain what happened.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.656
(sighs)

01:41.700 --> 01:44.726
Thanks for letting me know.

01:46.770 --> 01:49.204
You still on for
chess this Thursday?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.834
Been brushing up
on my Dvoretsky.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.531
You're gonna have
your hands full.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.378
Looking forward to it.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.439
(panﬁng)

02:08.190 --> 02:10.385
(animal growling)

02:19.870 --> 02:21.895
(animal growling)

02:25.340 --> 02:26.876
(animal growling)

02:29.480 --> 02:30.879
(grunts)

02:36.250 --> 02:38.389
(tires screech)

02:38.420 --> 02:40.888
Mister, you okay?!

02:40.920 --> 02:42.649
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.681
Mister.

02:53.670 --> 02:55.638
*

03:01.410 --> 03:02.672
WATSON:
Nice place.

03:02.710 --> 03:04.302
HOLMES:
It's a grotesquery.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.875
It's an edifice
to its owner's wealth.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.583
It's a brag made of brick,
stone and drywall.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.214
My late father
built it.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.923
After he plowed over
two farms and a school.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.951
He named it
Baskerville Hall.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.390
Small wonder that your father
and mine were friends.

03:21.430 --> 03:22.397
Sherlock Holmes.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.624
Henry.

03:23.670 --> 03:24.819
And you must be
Miss Watson.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.292
Yes. Hi.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.967
He sends his condolences,
my father.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.309
I appreciate that.
You said that

03:30.340 --> 03:31.967
you had some concerns
over your brother's death.

03:32.010 --> 03:33.534
I read about what happened.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.309
According to the news,
it was an accident.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.308
The coroner's report
said he was running,

03:37.350 --> 03:39.818
slipped off an embankment
and got hit by a truck.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.875
You sound skeptical.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.717
Charles ran in
Central Park every day.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.547
He knew those trails
backwards and forwards.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.649
He wouldn't run near the top
of an embankment like that,

03:47.690 --> 03:49.726
let alone accidentally
falling into traffic.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.978
So you think he was pushed.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.521
_ All I know is
my family has a lot of money.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.549
And where there's money...

03:55.600 --> 03:57.693
There's motive for murder.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.335
Who stands to inherit
in the event of Charles's death?

04:02.370 --> 04:03.735
I do.

04:03.770 --> 04:05.601
But I loved Charles.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.733
And I already have more money
than I know what to do with.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.975
I think this may be
about his business.

04:10.010 --> 04:12.274
He was _a venture
capitalist.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.312
He invested in tech start-ups,
and he was uncompromising

04:17.020 --> 04:18.612
I'm sure he made enemies.

04:18.650 --> 04:21.619
Are you thinking
of anyone specific?

04:21.660 --> 04:23.719
No. Ijust think
it's the best place to start.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.421
Understood.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.894
But any talk of motive
is premature at this point.

04:27.930 --> 04:31.297
We would start by establishing
the facts of the case.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.991
So you'll look into it?

04:33.040 --> 04:36.032
We'll examine the scene
of Charles's death.

04:36.070 --> 04:37.867
But not because of

04:37.910 --> 04:39.468
your connection to my father.

04:39.510 --> 04:40.977
If anything, we're gonna
have to look past that.

04:41.010 --> 04:43.001
I'll pay you whatever you need.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.642
My thoughts exactly.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.999
We'll be in touch.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.329
Henry Baskerville's wrong.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.659
His brother wasn't pushed,
he was chased.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.668
Looks like he ran
straight through these bushes.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.531
He must've been
scraped up pretty badly,

05:07.570 --> 05:08.969
but he never slowed down.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.060
Adrenaline narrows
the field of vision.

05:12.110 --> 05:14.601
Hence the term "a blind panic."

05:14.640 --> 05:16.073
It was night.

05:16.110 --> 05:18.670
Charles was fleeing
a relentless pursuer.

05:18.710 --> 05:21.417
He was running at full speed
and he glanced behind him

05:21.450 --> 05:22.815
at whoever was chasing him.

05:22.850 --> 05:24.488
He wouldn't have
seen the embankment

05:24.520 --> 05:26.408
until it was too late.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.485
The question is:
who was chasing him?

05:28.520 --> 05:30.556
Ground's frozen; has
been for some time.

05:30.590 --> 05:33.957
So no footprints.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.960
But... notice how these branches
are broken twice.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.729
Once by Charles,

05:40.770 --> 05:43.136
once by his pursuer.

05:43.170 --> 05:46.139
Whoever was chasing him
was big.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.968
Several inches
wider than Charles.

05:49.010 --> 05:51.342
Ran with a low stance.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.554
What is it?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.660
Someone else.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.998
A third party.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.498
Forced their way through here
from just behind this tree.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.132
Headed south.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.833
Away from Charles
and whoever was chasing him.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.939
Judging by
the degree of browning

06:25.980 --> 06:29.017
on the breaking points of this
twig, I'd say that both paths

06:29.050 --> 06:31.484
were created _
at roughly the same tIme.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.056
So maybe a witness.

06:33.090 --> 06:35.615
Saw something, ran.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.525
What was he doing here, alone
in the middle of the night

06:37.560 --> 06:40.654
in the dead of winter?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.190
He was drinking.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.697
(sniffs)

06:43.730 --> 06:47.894
Fortified wine
of the cheapest variety.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.971
It's from a liquor store just
half a mile south of here.

06:56.010 --> 06:59.104
Time-stamped an hour before
Charles's death.

06:59.150 --> 07:01.948
Should be more than enough for
you to track down our witness.

07:01.980 --> 07:04.039
Me?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.648
Where you going?

07:05.690 --> 07:08.955
It's the first
Thursday of the month.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.958
Wait, you're leaving
to go play chess?

07:17.570 --> 07:19.219
Hey, spare a little change?

07:19.270 --> 07:22.637
Hey, s-spare some change
for an Iraq vet?

07:22.670 --> 07:24.558
Here you go.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.204
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.641
Pretty lady gives me a 20,
she can do whatever she wants.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.648
You bought a bottle
of fortified wine

07:32.680 --> 07:34.648
from BRN Liquor
a few nights ago.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.682
They gave me your name,
said you were a regular,

07:36.720 --> 07:38.187
told me that you
work this area.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.085
They treat me okay.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.054
They don't act like
I got the plague or nothing.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.058
You brought the
bottle to the park,

07:44.090 --> 07:46.456
and then you saw something that
scared you, and you ran away.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.222
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.830
Hey, I just want to know
what you saw.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.189
No, y-you're from
the hospital.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.969
Y-You just want me to
say something crazy

07:57.010 --> 07:58.568
so you can take me away.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.134
Y-You want me
to take my meds.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.932
No, I just want to know
what you saw.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.005
And I want to help you
find a place to stay tonight.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.779
Here, you can take the money
either way.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.843
There was this guy.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.552
H-He was running,
he was afraid.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.717
Did you see who was chasing him?

08:15.760 --> 08:18.228
It wasn't a who, it was a what.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.922
What do you mean?

08:20.960 --> 08:22.860
It was an animal.

08:22.900 --> 08:27.530
Big like a... like a bear
or like a giant wolf.

08:27.570 --> 08:30.698
It had this-this
crazy growl like...

08:30.740 --> 08:32.731
(imitates growling)

08:34.280 --> 08:36.999
And it was glowing.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.301
Like a lantern.

08:38.350 --> 08:41.569
It was glowing?

08:45.620 --> 08:46.917
Checkmate.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.281
The usual.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.892
Actually, Eugene, your play has
been distinctly subpar today.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.898
Are you aware
that our average game lasts

08:54.930 --> 08:56.192
approximately 46 moves?

08:56.230 --> 08:59.063
I don't really
keep track.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.795
It speaks to your skill.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.262
And yet, today we've played
four games of

09:02.300 --> 09:05.235
21, 33, 28 and 19 moves.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.704
Add that to your rather
sleepy disposition,

09:07.740 --> 09:10.709
your work on the Gupta case,
and,uh".

09:10.750 --> 09:12.968
I must say, I'm concerned.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.239
I'm fine.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.646
Two months ago, a bomb
went off in this facility

09:18.690 --> 09:22.012
and a close friend of yours
was killed in the blast.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.858
You yourself were nearly killed.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.120
I can only imagine
the trepidation you must feel

09:27.160 --> 09:28.195
coming to work here.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.629
It's a small wonder
you've started

09:29.670 --> 09:30.728
taking anti-anxiety medication

09:30.770 --> 09:32.169
while at work.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.302
(chuckles softly)

09:37.340 --> 09:38.864
Lot of people take
anti-anxiety meds.

09:38.910 --> 09:41.333
That may be,
but based on my observations,

09:41.380 --> 09:43.769
you're taking
an unusually large dose,

09:43.810 --> 09:46.005
enough to produce
mild cognitive impairment.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.870
19 moves, Eugene.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.013
And you missed
an obvious avenue of escape.

09:50.050 --> 09:53.349
I'm sorry I'm not
giving good chess.

09:53.390 --> 09:56.052
Like you said, I have
a lot on my mind.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.682
Yeah, and yet
you're not in therapy.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.220
You're just self-medicating.

09:59.260 --> 10:00.898
I'm fine.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.160
Lunch break's over.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.690
I should get back to it.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.220
You've got another 13 minutes.

10:06.270 --> 10:09.762
Yeah, well, maybe I've taken
enough beatings for one day.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.801
Thanks for the games.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.909
What's all that?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.382
Case materials.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.920
Those are old cases.

10:31.960 --> 10:32.995
What are they doing
back up here?

10:33.030 --> 10:34.918
I expected you home
hours ago.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.666
Were you not able to find
the man who witnessed

10:36.700 --> 10:38.327
Charles Baskerville's
run through the woods?

10:38.370 --> 10:39.997
Ifound him.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.735
Helped him find a shelter.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.101
He was homeless.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.869
Did he see
who was chasing Charles?

10:44.910 --> 10:47.003
(sighs)

10:47.040 --> 10:49.179
Sort of.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.214
Giant, glowing wolf.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.718
Or a very small bear.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.741
Like I said,
the guy was off his meds,

10:57.790 --> 10:59.678
he was drunk. I mean...

10:59.720 --> 11:01.210
Why do you look like

11:01.260 --> 11:02.409
you're taking
this seriously?

11:02.460 --> 11:04.087
Because it is,
in its way,

11:04.130 --> 11:06.894
a confirmation that Charles
was chased to his death.

11:06.930 --> 11:10.764
By a giant four-legged animal
that was lit up like a lantern.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.360
As you said, the man you spoke
with was in an altered state--

11:13.400 --> 11:17.029
maybe two-- but he was there
and he did see something.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.765
What if Charles's pursuer

11:18.810 --> 11:22.906
was just a large man in bulky,
light-reflecting winter gear?

11:22.950 --> 11:25.168
Oh, you have
a very large man in mind?

11:25.210 --> 11:26.768
While you were out,

11:26.820 --> 11:28.117
Henry Baskerville
gave me access

11:28.150 --> 11:29.845
to his brother's
socral media account.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.187
As you know, it's common

11:31.220 --> 11:33.188
for such accounts
to become memorials

11:33.220 --> 11:35.211
in the event
of their user's death.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.057
I wanted to see who had
visited Charles's page

11:37.090 --> 11:38.318
and who'd left
their condolences,

11:38.360 --> 11:40.954
and I discovered this.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.122
It's a messaging app.

11:46.170 --> 11:48.195
There are two distinct inboxes--

11:48.240 --> 11:51.232
one for friends and one for
messages from strangers.

11:51.270 --> 11:53.875
There's no evidence that Charles
ever accessed either of them.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.105
But the second inbox
drew my attention.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.738
WATSON: "You're committing
crimes against nature.

11:59.780 --> 12:02.510
You will reap the whirlwind."

12:02.550 --> 12:04.484
These are death threats.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.784
All left by the same
anonymous user.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.288
He apparently took issue
with Charles's biotech ventures

12:09.320 --> 12:11.754
under the aegis
of one of his companies,

12:11.790 --> 12:13.326
Baskerville Genetics.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.193
Producers of such horr_ors
as drought-resrstant rice

12:16.230 --> 12:18.221
and improved-yield cotton.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.090
And you couldn't find him.

12:20.140 --> 12:23.166
He's proven quite adept
at concealing his identity.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.236
But he did let slip one
telling personal detail.

12:26.270 --> 12:29.842
"Pray we never
meet in person.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.905
I'm twice your size."

12:33.920 --> 12:36.946
You really think
that someone killed Charles

12:36.990 --> 12:38.480
because of the work
we were domg?

12:38.520 --> 12:40.488
The work you do
is controversial.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.988
(sighs)
Well, it shouldn't be.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.919
As you can see, the genetically
modified organisms we create

12:45.960 --> 12:47.825
are harmless.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.896
Pest-resistant potatoes.

12:49.930 --> 12:51.818
Hens that can
produce more eggs.

12:51.870 --> 12:53.497
The fact remains,
Charles Baskerville received

12:53.540 --> 12:55.531
death threats over
his association with this lab,

12:55.570 --> 12:56.935
and then died.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.460
Well, we all
receive threats.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.205
It's a hazard
of the trade.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.377
One of the people

13:01.410 --> 13:03.901
who sent threats
to Charles stood out.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.372
The way he described himself

13:05.410 --> 13:07.116
fit the physical description
of our killer.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.845
We thought if he threatened
anyone else here,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.416
we might be able
to identify him.

13:10.450 --> 13:13.385
IfI could see
the notes in question...

13:13.420 --> 13:16.958
Sherlock has them on his phone.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.393
(barks)

13:25.430 --> 13:27.432
That is not
a pest-resnstant potato.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.563
No, that's Cornwall.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.534
He's a very special dog.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.470
I can tell.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.174
WATSON:
Oh, my God.

13:37.210 --> 13:39.576
It's glowing.

13:40.980 --> 13:43.039
Is he also modified
to account for his whereabouts

13:43.090 --> 13:45.945
the night Charles Baskerville
was murdered?

13:51.960 --> 13:53.621
WATSON :
Good boy.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.457
Technically,
Cornwall's a chimera.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.491
An animal with genetic material
from two different species.

13:57.530 --> 13:59.191
In his case,
we introduced

13:59.230 --> 14:02.563
jellyfish DNA to make
his skin bioluminescent.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.999
He seems very sweet.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.359
He is.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.275
And he loved Charles.

14:07.310 --> 14:11.178
They used to throw
that ball around all the time.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.212
As for Cornwall's whereabouts
the night Charles died,

14:13.250 --> 14:15.115
he's never left the lab.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.913
How can you be certain?

14:16.950 --> 14:18.941
We monitor him
constantly.

14:18.990 --> 14:21.288
The jellyfish DNA
is an experiment.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.651
If he stays healthy,

14:22.690 --> 14:24.658
_ that means we can
Introduce genetic code

14:24.690 --> 14:26.282
for resisting cancer

14:26.330 --> 14:28.423
or enhancing motor skills,
controlling blood sugar.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.098
You name it.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.098
Well, he could be
the "GMO-trocity"

14:32.130 --> 14:33.461
that triggered the threats.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.593
People who send
those kinds of messages

14:35.640 --> 14:38.268
aren't particularly discerning
in their judgments.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.130
"GMO-trocity"?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.932
The person you're
looking for used

14:41.980 --> 14:43.004
that exact term?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.347
Multiple times a message.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.268
Yes, I received similar threats.

14:46.310 --> 14:47.971
Dozens a week.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.011
Actually, our security people
are looking into it.

14:50.050 --> 14:51.210
I'll call them.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.184
I hope by now

14:53.220 --> 14:56.018
they've managed
to locate the sender.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.354
WATSON: Mr. Selden,
we work with the police.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.027
Please answer the door.

15:02.060 --> 15:04.164
I can hear you breathing.
Open up.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.567
Or would you prefer we spoke
with your probation officer?

15:16.010 --> 15:18.547
What do you want?

15:20.580 --> 15:22.411
I heard about
Charles Baskerville's

15:22.450 --> 15:24.987
little accident on the news.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.578
(grunts)

15:26.620 --> 15:28.713
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer perverter of science.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.182
Actually,

15:30.230 --> 15:31.424
we don't think it
was an accrdent.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.155
Not exactly.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.395
We think someone was chasing
him the night that he died.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.125
And you thought that I...?

15:37.170 --> 15:38.421
(chuckles)

15:38.470 --> 15:41.689
Baskerville was offed
Sunday night, right?

15:41.740 --> 15:43.469
Just after 9:00.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.070
I was at a comedy club
with my sister.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.600
Big mistake.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.733
Every bozo that got onstage

15:49.780 --> 15:52.374
made me the centerpiece
of their routines.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.248
Fat shaming is the last
acceptable prejudice in America.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.759
We found you through your
posts on anti-GMO Web sites.

16:01.790 --> 16:04.350
We know that you communicate
with a lot of people

16:04.390 --> 16:06.085
who share your outlook.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.519
Do you think any of them ever
threatened Charles Baskerville?

16:08.560 --> 16:13.031
Nah. The people on those sites
are mostly whiners and posers.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.230
Unlike you?

16:14.270 --> 16:15.635
I put myself

16:15.670 --> 16:17.365
out there.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.231
GMOs are a threat
to human existence.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.703
Modiﬁed foods
can make us sick.

16:22.740 --> 16:26.278
Modiﬁed diseases
could wipe us out.

16:26.310 --> 16:28.710
I tell the people making
the stuff what's what.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.718
So you've sent threats
to people

16:30.750 --> 16:33.389
other than the employees
of Baskerville Genetics?

16:33.420 --> 16:36.583
Take a look at my research
on the table.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.281
Go ahead.

16:41.730 --> 16:45.564
You think they're the only ones
creating abominations?

16:49.170 --> 16:50.535
This is a chicken?

16:50.570 --> 16:51.798
Engineered to be

16:51.840 --> 16:54.673
featherless _
for easrer processmg.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.201
You could've eaten one of_ those
and not even known It.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.399
Hmm.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.042
Hey, you should
take a look at this.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.378
What precisely is this?

17:08.420 --> 17:09.819
SELDEN:
A war dog.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.351
Made for the US. military.

17:12.390 --> 17:14.255
It's supposed to be stronger,

17:14.300 --> 17:16.723
smarter and faster
than a normal dog.

17:16.760 --> 17:20.196
And willing to kill on command.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.629
But, hey, let them

17:22.670 --> 17:26.606
keep telling you
how harmless GMOs are.

17:26.640 --> 17:30.440
Oh, I'll admit Charles and I
had our disagreements.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.777
HOLMES:
He underbid you

17:31.810 --> 17:33.744
on several valuable contracts.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.816
Beat you to market
with drought-resistant rice

17:38.120 --> 17:40.384
Then he got hit by a truck--
karma.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.718
I'm still not sure why I'm here.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.455
The department's decided
to reopen the investigation

17:44.490 --> 17:46.355
into Charles Baskerville's
death.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.597
We now have reason to believe
he was murdered.

17:48.630 --> 17:49.858
You think I did it?

17:49.900 --> 17:51.663
WATSON:
A witness told us

17:51.700 --> 17:56.091
that Charles was chased down
by some sort of strange anImal.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.337
It might even be
as strange as this.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.575
(chuckles)

18:02.610 --> 18:05.204
You think I sicced
one of these on him?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.878
And being accused of murder
is humorous why?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.616
Because this animal
doesn't exrst.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.709
WATSON: We have evidence
that your company

18:12.750 --> 18:14.854
has been developing
these so-called war dogs

18:14.890 --> 18:16.653
for the US. military.

18:16.690 --> 18:19.750
According to public records,
the US. Army Research

18:19.790 --> 18:22.793
Laboratory gave you $5 million
in preliminary development funds

18:22.830 --> 18:25.719
for something they call
"an enhanced canine asset."

18:25.770 --> 18:29.228
They did,
but that picture's a mock-up.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.602
It's concept art
from our proposal,

18:31.640 --> 18:33.505
the one that got us
that grant.

18:33.540 --> 18:35.599
So you're saying you never
actually developed these dogs?

18:35.640 --> 18:38.370
The Army wanted the animals
to be fast, strong, smart,

18:38.410 --> 18:39.775
practically wanted them to talk.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.471
It was too much.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.249
We tried a dozen
different approaches,

18:43.290 --> 18:45.884
but every attempt ended up
either stillborn or nonviable.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.512
BELL:
Got any way to prove that?

18:47.560 --> 18:48.913
ANTON:
Call the ARL.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.281
When they saw our results,
they cut off our funding.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.491
Point is,
I can't kill anyone

18:53.530 --> 18:55.691
with a super dog
that doesn't exist.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.564
Look, you want to identify
people who wanted Charles dead?

19:01.600 --> 19:04.398
Easy-- make a list of everyone
he ever patent-jacked.

19:06.910 --> 19:09.231
You know about
the patent-jacking, right?

19:09.280 --> 19:11.748
Patent-jacking?

19:11.780 --> 19:14.476
A neologism for
the hijacking of patents.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.839
Or so I infer.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.383
Charles Baskerville had it
down to an art form.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.719
Now say you're a start-up with
a brilliant idea but no money.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.648
He'd give you
working capital in exchange

19:23.690 --> 19:25.920
for shares in the company
and seats on your board.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.929
But once he had
a controlling Interest, bang.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.521
He'd liquidate the company
and sell off its assets.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.390
Mostly to himself.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.965
And most especially the patents.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.299
He stole the hopes and dreams of
dozens of brilliant inventors.

19:40.340 --> 19:44.447
If you really think someone
sent a monster after him,

19:44.480 --> 19:46.744
I'd start with them.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.714
HOLMES:
Corporate records of

19:48.750 --> 19:50.809
Charles Baskerville's meetings
with more than

19:50.850 --> 19:53.410
30 of his alleged
patent-jacking victims.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.586
We do not want

19:54.620 --> 19:55.917
for suspects.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.552
I'm surprised Henry
didn't mention

19:57.590 --> 20:00.252
this patent-jacking before.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.653
Well, it's possible
he wasn't aware.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.361
Some people have a way
of blinding themselves

20:03.400 --> 20:05.459
to the faults of those
that they love or admIre.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.730
Did you know that
American icon

20:07.770 --> 20:09.897
Thomas Edison used
similar techniques

20:09.940 --> 20:11.601
to acquire many of his patents?

20:11.640 --> 20:13.608
He would invite
young Inventors

20:13.640 --> 20:14.868
to show him their creations,

20:14.910 --> 20:16.673
and then he would
have his employees

20:16.710 --> 20:19.349
reverse-engineer their work
and then patent the results.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.677
The real inventors

20:20.720 --> 20:21.778
wouldn't see a penny.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.845
I get it now.
Yeah.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.609
The only thing Edison didn't
patent was patent-jacking.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.015
No, I'm not talking about that;
I'm talking about

20:28.060 --> 20:29.709
all this stuff
that you've been reading.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.580
Our recent cases-- Hawes.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.497
Yeah, he's been struggling.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.327
That Gupta thing.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.362
The contaminated DNA.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.630
I wanted to make certain that
there weren't other mistakes.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.797
And?

20:42.840 --> 20:45.365
I found some typos.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.401
His reports have been
more perfunctory of late.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.839
That's it?

20:48.880 --> 20:50.472
For now.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.644
After everything that happened,
he was prescribed

20:54.680 --> 20:57.387
certain medications, and I fear
he's been misusing them.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.342
That's why you left yesterday
to talk to him.

20:59.390 --> 21:00.652
Mm-hmm.
How'd it go?

21:00.690 --> 21:01.884
Pooﬂy.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.456
Is there anything
you want me to...?

21:03.490 --> 21:05.879
No, I thinkI know
what I need to do next.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.857
Hmm.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.323
Find something?

21:12.370 --> 21:15.669
I think Henry did know about
his brother's patent-jacking.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.009
These are minutes from
a meeting that Charles had

21:18.040 --> 21:20.065
with one of those companies
he screwed over.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.305
Henry was in attendance.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.419
If he was present at other
meetings with other victims,

21:27.450 --> 21:30.749
that would suggest he was
an active participant

21:30.790 --> 21:32.678
in his brother's crime.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.551
If Charles really was killed
over patent-jacking,

21:34.590 --> 21:36.080
Henry could be a target, too.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.385
HENRY: Charles didn't
do anything wrong.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.057
The owners of the start-ups
he liquidated

21:41.100 --> 21:42.749
were well compensated.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.097
Did they want more than that?

21:44.130 --> 21:45.961
Maybe, but I can't see
any of them

21:46.000 --> 21:48.036
being angry enough
to commit murder.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.095
Imagine you're one of the
inventors that Charles fleeced.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.529
Imagine watching him make
millions from your brainchild,

21:52.570 --> 21:53.832
while you're forced
to walk away

21:53.880 --> 21:56.531
with $100,000 and
a hearty handshake.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.899
I'll take a look at my notes

21:57.950 --> 21:59.838
from the meetings
you mentioned, okay?

21:59.880 --> 22:02.815
See if anyone stands out,
but that's the best I can...

22:04.890 --> 22:06.016
Henry?

22:06.050 --> 22:07.449
Sorry.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.879
Thought I saw something
in my backyard.

22:11.490 --> 22:13.128
What the hell?

22:13.160 --> 22:15.458
WATSON:
Something wrong?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.593
There's something out there.

22:17.630 --> 22:20.463
It's glowing.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.468
Henry, stay away
from the windows.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.728
What the hell's going on?

22:23.770 --> 22:26.864
We're not sure, but whatever it
is, we think it chased Charles

22:26.910 --> 22:27.934
into traffic the other night.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.607
HOLMES: Just don't let it get
anywhere near you.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.777
We're calling the police.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.777
Can-can you describe
what you saw?

22:34.820 --> 22:36.640
Uh, I... H don't know.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.944
Uh, it's an animal,
uh, it's on four legs.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.480
(glass shatters)

22:40.520 --> 22:41.817
Oh, my God.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.884
It's in the house.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.888
(animal growling)

22:44.930 --> 22:46.682
Henry, what's that noise?

22:46.730 --> 22:49.096
It-it's the animal,
it's the thing.

22:49.130 --> 22:50.620
Tell me the cops are coming.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.625
Henry, be quiet.

22:51.670 --> 22:52.967
It's in the damn house.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.991
(growling continues)

22:56.940 --> 22:59.033
(pounding)

22:59.070 --> 23:00.469
It's breaking down the door.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.178
Henry, I think I might know
what's attacking you.

23:07.210 --> 23:09.815
I need you to go outside,
go to your swimming pool.

23:09.850 --> 23:12.045
Keep the swimming pool
between you and it.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.079
But...

23:13.120 --> 23:15.452
The swimming pool. Now, Henry!

23:15.490 --> 23:17.481
Police are
on their way.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.464
WATSON: We're consultants
with the NYPD.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.467
Captain Gregson called about us.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.694
HENRY:
I have no idea what it is.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.459
I've never_ seen
anything lIke It before.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.467
Excuse me.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.808
Hey. Are you okay?

23:30.840 --> 23:32.660
Yes, thanks to
your partner.

23:32.710 --> 23:34.837
You said to keep the
pool between me and it.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.600
How did you know it would
try to run across the tarp?

23:38.650 --> 23:40.447
(mechanical clanking)

23:40.480 --> 23:42.016
Only slightly
less outrageous

23:42.050 --> 23:44.018
than a glowing mastiff,
wouldn't you agree?

23:44.050 --> 23:46.587
(mechanical clanking, growling)

23:56.260 --> 23:59.127
Just when you think
you've seen everything.

23:59.170 --> 24:01.661
You said it was based
on one of the patents

24:01.700 --> 24:03.236
Charles Baskerville looted?

24:03.270 --> 24:04.806
Several, actually.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.205
From multiple sources.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.707
That's one of the reasons
I wasn't able

24:07.740 --> 24:09.230
_ to work out
Its true nature sooner.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.578
Yeah, about that.

24:11.610 --> 24:13.578
The distinctive growl
I heard over the phone,

24:13.620 --> 24:15.576
that was the first clue,
and that comes

24:15.620 --> 24:17.884
from these high-efficiency
hybrid engines

24:17.920 --> 24:20.616
developed by
Devonshire Robotics.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.150
The vague dog-like
appearance is

24:22.190 --> 24:23.589
due to this reinforced frame--

24:23.630 --> 24:25.257
that was patented
by a different company.

24:25.290 --> 24:28.088
A third company developed
these terrain-adaptive legs.

24:28.130 --> 24:29.256
So on, so forth.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.961
Charles only held on

24:31.000 --> 24:33.264
to biotech and genetic
engineering patents for himself.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.961
The rest he sold off.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.833
So someone bought
his stolen patents

24:37.870 --> 24:39.838
and made a Terminator.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.030
Sherlock shared
what we know

24:41.080 --> 24:42.570
with a friend who works in

24:42.610 --> 24:43.975
automation
and artIfICIal Intelligence.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.001
HOLMES: She confirmed
that it employs

24:46.050 --> 24:48.644
fire-and-forget targeting,
like a missile.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.739
An operator pilots it
until it acquires

24:50.790 --> 24:53.042
a visual lock on its target,

24:53.090 --> 24:56.059
at which point it can be ordered
to eliminate that target

24:56.090 --> 24:57.921
without any further input.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.882
WATSON: That's why it fell
into the covered pool.

24:59.930 --> 25:01.158
It was target-fixated on Henry.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.849
It charged at him full-speed,

25:02.900 --> 25:04.993
didn't realize the tarp
wasn't solid ground.

25:05.030 --> 25:06.793
I don't see any guns.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.661
How did it expect to kill him

25:08.700 --> 25:10.031
once it caught him?

25:10.070 --> 25:12.630
It tore through a solid oak door
with its front legs.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.604
It was gonna stomp him to death?

25:14.640 --> 25:17.029
Do we know
whose Idea It was

25:17.080 --> 25:18.604
to build this thing?

25:18.650 --> 25:20.618
We can guess
who paid for it, right?

25:20.650 --> 25:24.313
The military, same as with those
genetically-engineered war dogs?

25:24.350 --> 25:26.614
Unfortunately, they haven't
returned our calls.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.117
we've got calls into
Devonshire Robotics

25:30.160 --> 25:31.752
and the other plundered firms.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.894
And hopefully one of them
will be able to tell us

25:33.930 --> 25:35.921
who acquired
their patents.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.295
Welcome to _
Stapleton Innovations.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.195
I'm Rodger Stapleton.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.662
Yeah, Detective Bell.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.007
This is Sherlock Holmes
and Joan Watson.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.007
They consult for
the department.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.803
Like to ask you

25:47.840 --> 25:49.808
a few questions about this.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.811
Where'd you find it?

25:53.850 --> 25:56.774
At the home of the man
it tried to maul last night.

25:56.820 --> 25:58.981
We were hoping you could
explain how it got there.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.779
(electronic rock music playing
over TV)

26:05.660 --> 26:07.355
We shot this a few months ago.

26:07.390 --> 26:10.826
I think it'll help explain a few
things about the Gus machine.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.191
You named your
killer robot Gus?

26:13.230 --> 26:15.061
Oh, it wasn't
designed to kill.

26:15.100 --> 26:18.809
It's supposed to carry gear for
the infantry, like a pack mule.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.832
And yet we're investigating two
different attacks by your mule,

26:21.880 --> 26:23.233
one of them fatal.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.838
LAURA:
Someone obviously used

26:24.880 --> 26:27.246
one of the Guses in a
way that was off-spec.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.113
"One of the Guses"?

26:30.150 --> 26:32.186
We've built a total
of ten Gus robots.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.984
The one used in the attacks
has to be Gus Five.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.181
And how can you be certain?

26:37.220 --> 26:40.189
Because Gus Five
is... was missmg.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.255
About six weeks ago,
we shipped Gus Five

26:42.300 --> 26:44.268
to the Army Research Lab's
proving grounds

26:44.300 --> 26:45.961
in Maryland.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.969
They said he
never arrived.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.069
Did you call the police?

26:50.100 --> 26:52.068
The ARL ordered
us not to.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.078
The entire project
is classified.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.930
They assigned the case

26:55.980 --> 26:57.845
to the Defense Criminal
Investigation Serwce.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.405
Some agents came and
conducted interviews,

27:00.450 --> 27:02.338
but that was the last
we heard from them.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.416
And you're sure it was
stolen in transit?

27:04.450 --> 27:06.008
RODGER: Well, we haven't
ruled anything out.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.881
Could have been taken
by someone here.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.218
It also could have been someone
at the shipping company

27:10.260 --> 27:12.023
or the testing facility.

27:12.060 --> 27:13.948
Or maybe it wasn't
an inside job at all.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.821
Can you think of anyone
in Stapleton Innovations

27:16.860 --> 27:20.296
who might have motive to kill
Charles and Henry Baskerville?

27:20.330 --> 27:23.299
Actually, I can.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.069
Me.

27:27.810 --> 27:30.370
Did Henry tell you about
the Baskerville trust?

27:30.410 --> 27:31.946
He did not.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.345
You know each other?

27:35.420 --> 27:38.241
The trust is where Charles
got most of his money,

27:38.290 --> 27:40.178
from the estate of
Hugo Baskerville,

27:40.220 --> 27:41.312
the rail baron.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.713
It passes,

27:42.760 --> 27:45.354
intact,
to the oldest surviving heir.

27:45.390 --> 27:48.928
That was Charles;
now it's Henry.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.359
I'm their cousin.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.960
So you're next in line.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.834
Next and last,
as far as anyone knows.

27:56.870 --> 27:59.338
But I loved Charles;
same goes for Henry.

27:59.370 --> 28:01.201
I wouldn't hurt them,
not for anything.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.071
BELL:
Can you tell us

28:03.110 --> 28:05.840
where you were last night
and Sunday evening?

28:05.880 --> 28:07.871
Montana.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.740
I got back
this morning.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.441
Charles's funeral
is tomorrow.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.311
I go on a grouse hunting trip
every year with my friends.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.079
They'll tell you,
I was there the whole week.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.089
_ The Baskerville trust seems
like a strong motive for murder.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.121
Yeah, but Stapleton's alibi
seemed pretty solid,

28:22.160 --> 28:23.764
unless you think
he could've remote-controlled

28:23.800 --> 28:25.097
Gus Five from Montana.

28:25.130 --> 28:26.825
Anything's possible.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.497
Well, maybe we should look
at the Army Research Lab.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.292
Could be someone there
up to no good.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.729
I don't think we'll have
to go that far afield.

28:35.810 --> 28:37.402
BELL:
It's a nice smoking area.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.442
You want to tell us
what you're looking for?

28:39.480 --> 28:42.074
Looking for someone.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.940
The individual who smokes
this brand of cigarette.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.446
VVho?

28:45.490 --> 28:47.378
You didn't smell it on him
during the meeting?

28:47.420 --> 28:48.387
(door opens)

28:48.420 --> 28:50.923
Mr. Barrymore.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.279
So nice of you
to join us.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.298
Your arrival in this
area was ineVItable

28:54.330 --> 28:55.991
after such a
stressful meeting.

28:56.030 --> 28:58.328
Uh, something wrong?

28:58.370 --> 29:00.895
Well, it was clear that you
were hiding something from us.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.237
Specifically, you
seemed uncomfortable

29:02.270 --> 29:04.238
when your boss was
providing his alibi.

29:04.270 --> 29:05.862
So I'd like to know why.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.174
BELL:
You withhold information

29:08.210 --> 29:11.509
on a murder case, Mr. Barrymore,
that's felony obstruction.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.519
Look, Rodger was lying
through his teeth, all right?

29:14.550 --> 29:16.313
He wasn't in Montana.

29:16.350 --> 29:18.545
How do you know?

29:18.590 --> 29:19.909
It's an open secret
at the company

29:19.950 --> 29:21.110
that his hunting trips are BS.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.027
He lies to his wife about them,
and we all have to cover.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.255
Is there a mistress?

29:26.290 --> 29:29.396
More like a series of
professmnal arrangements.

29:29.430 --> 29:30.590
He goes whoring.

29:30.630 --> 29:33.167
BARRYMORE: I ran into him at a
strip club in Manhattan once

29:33.200 --> 29:35.532
when he was supposed to be
hunting elk in Colorado.

29:35.570 --> 29:38.562
He was with this girl,
really expensive-looking.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.032
He invited me
to sit with him.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.879
We had drinks.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.207
I even walked him
back to his hotel.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.049
Do you remember
where this was in Manhattan?

29:45.080 --> 29:47.344
It's some fancy place.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.211
Uh, the Undershaw?

29:49.250 --> 29:52.310
That's less than a mile from
where Charles Baskerville died.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.228
If you're here
for another match...

30:05.270 --> 30:08.091
I'm not.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.109
No new homicide victims
Since yesterday,

30:11.140 --> 30:12.562
so you're not here
for a body.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.579
No, I'm here for you.

30:15.610 --> 30:18.306
Look”.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.102
I told you yesterday...

30:20.150 --> 30:21.469
You're not fine, Eugene.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.078
I know.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.111
And I know 'cause I've
been where you are.

30:25.150 --> 30:27.482
(scoffs)
I'm an addict now?

30:27.520 --> 30:29.351
No.

30:29.390 --> 30:30.550
(sighs)

30:32.430 --> 30:36.389
See, there was this woman,
once upon a time, right?

30:36.430 --> 30:39.399
And to me, uh...

30:39.430 --> 30:42.968
to me, she was
the woman, you know?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.969
And she died.

30:46.010 --> 30:49.537
Well, (chuckles)
I thought she did.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.571
And I lost myself.

30:54.050 --> 30:57.542
Yeah, the pain was, um...

30:57.580 --> 31:00.879
it was very intense,
so I began to self-medicate,

31:00.920 --> 31:02.615
and then my work
began to suffer,

31:02.660 --> 31:04.184
and 1-1 made
these small mistakes.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.324
Small errors at
first, and then

31:07.360 --> 31:09.351
much larger ones.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.891
And eventually my own
ineptitude was so apparent

31:11.930 --> 31:15.229
that... I couldn't deny it.

31:15.270 --> 31:17.568
And my self-esteem shattered.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.569
And then I just,
I fell into this spiral

31:20.610 --> 31:24.102
of... self-pity,
addiction and-and despair.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.141
I... I don't know

31:26.180 --> 31:27.442
whether you're an addict or not.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.948
Uh, I don't think you are.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.982
But you're not well.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.421
I'm hurting.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.257
But I'll manage.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.497
I am managing.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.094
You just...

31:46.130 --> 31:49.691
You're standing
on a precipice...

31:49.740 --> 31:52.402
and I cannot watch you
tumble over it, mate.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.945
I refuse to.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.479
All right?

32:05.750 --> 32:07.411
BELL:
Your Signature on

32:07.450 --> 32:09.714
room service receipts.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.548
Testimony from hotel staff
confirming you were a guest.

32:13.590 --> 32:16.252
And final receipt charged
to Stapleton Innovations.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.518
WATSON:
You already admitted you had

32:18.570 --> 32:20.162
motive to kill
the Baskervilles.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.464
To top it off, the department's
computer experts

32:22.500 --> 32:25.003
confirmed that
your activation codes

32:25.040 --> 32:26.530
were used to trigger
the Gus robot

32:26.570 --> 32:28.674
when it attacked
Charles and Henry.

32:28.710 --> 32:32.009
It's not looking good for you,
Mr. Stapleton.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.019
You might think about
cutting a deal with the DA.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.312
I didn't do it.

32:36.350 --> 32:38.147
That's not what
the evidence says.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.612
The evidence
is wrong.

32:39.650 --> 32:41.151
I already told you.

32:41.190 --> 32:44.159
I loved Charles.
I love Henry.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.556
And my activation codes
aren't much of a secret.

32:46.590 --> 32:49.093
I use them in front _
of my employees all the time.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.360
And, yes, I may not
have been in Montana,

32:51.400 --> 32:53.220
but I wasn't alone either.

32:53.270 --> 32:55.488
I was with a friend

32:55.540 --> 32:57.735
at the time of
Charles's death.

32:57.770 --> 33:02.230
I was with another friend on the
night that Henry was attacked.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.249
I'm happy to have them
confirm my story.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.498
I'm guessing
when you say "friend,"

33:07.550 --> 33:09.108
you mean prostitute.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.549
If you paid them
for their company,

33:10.580 --> 33:12.514
they're not gonna be
the most credible witnesses.

33:12.550 --> 33:16.714
You want proof that
I didn't try to kill my cousins

33:16.760 --> 33:18.523
to inherit
the Baskerville trust?

33:18.560 --> 33:21.290
Fine. I have a perfect way
to do that.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.719
We're listening.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.399
I'll punch him in the face.

33:26.430 --> 33:27.397
Or you.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.136
Rodger...
No.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.536
Either way, it's assault
on a police officer-- a felony.

33:31.570 --> 33:34.698
Four witnesses-- there's
no way I dodge a conVIction.

33:34.740 --> 33:39.040
And it would prove
you're innocence how?

33:39.080 --> 33:40.479
The terms of
Hugo Baskerville's will

33:40.510 --> 33:42.171
are very clear.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.212
No one guilty of a felony
can inherit the trust.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.458
I'm convicted of assault,
I'll be disinherited.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.381
So how 'bout it?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.825
(door opens)

33:56.860 --> 33:59.420
WATSON:
Hold on to your hat.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.698
Rodger Stapleton's friends

34:00.730 --> 34:03.460
backed up his alibi.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.206
And were they both
ladies of the night?

34:05.240 --> 34:06.537
Yes.

34:06.570 --> 34:08.128
Stapleton was paying
for their services

34:08.180 --> 34:10.375
the two nights in question.

34:10.410 --> 34:13.504
It's hard to imagine
he's not paying them again now.

34:13.550 --> 34:17.111
You seem determined to
keep him as a suspect.

34:17.150 --> 34:18.811
It was hard to buy anything
he was selling today.

34:18.850 --> 34:21.410
Even that offer
to plead guilty to a felony.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.758
Maybe he thought it was worth
sacrificing his inheritance

34:23.790 --> 34:25.257
to avoid a murder conviction.

34:25.290 --> 34:26.723
It's possible.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.421
_ But if the evidence
is telling us a different story,

34:28.460 --> 34:30.223
perhaps we should listen.

34:30.260 --> 34:33.229
You have a better suspect
in the Baskerville family tree?

34:33.270 --> 34:36.489
Hypothetically, thousands.
And none.

34:36.540 --> 34:39.236
Even if we're wrong
about the murderer,

34:39.270 --> 34:40.862
we could be right
about the motive.

34:40.910 --> 34:43.231
Killing Henry and Charles
and framing Rodger

34:43.280 --> 34:44.702
with one of his robots

34:44.750 --> 34:46.502
clears the way for another
claimant to the trust.

34:46.550 --> 34:49.610
Okay, so who's next in line?

34:49.650 --> 34:51.641
At first glance,
no one.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.386
It appears the
Baskerville men,

34:54.420 --> 34:57.150
apart from Hugo himself,
struggle with infertility.

34:57.190 --> 34:59.750
Henry and Charles
have no children.

34:59.790 --> 35:02.156
Rodger Stapleton
has no legitimate offspring.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.465
And as far as I can tell,
no by-blows from his wenching.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.365
There's also been a
fair share of bad luck.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.336
Henry and Charles's sister Clara
died of cancer in her teens.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.201
Their first cousin
was killed in Afghanistan,

35:13.240 --> 35:14.400
and Rodger's older brother Ike

35:14.440 --> 35:16.670
died in a car_crash
in Australia.

35:16.710 --> 35:18.473
So after Charles's death,

35:18.510 --> 35:21.343
the only living heirs
are Rodger and Henry.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.439
The only known living heirs.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.708
I reviewed
Hugo Baskerville's will.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.445
For_a man
of his time,

35:26.490 --> 35:28.458
he was remarkably enlightened
about bastards.

35:28.490 --> 35:30.617
He allowed that
a lovechild could inherit,

35:30.660 --> 35:33.185
provided there were
no legitimate heirs remaining.

35:33.230 --> 35:34.595
So while the many branches

35:34.630 --> 35:38.225
of this tree might
appear barren,

35:38.270 --> 35:40.568
who's to say that
some unknown cross-pollination

35:40.600 --> 35:42.158
has not borne fruit?

35:42.200 --> 35:43.428
If that's true,

35:43.470 --> 35:47.167
all we have to do
is look through...

35:47.210 --> 35:49.770
120 years of birth records
to find a new suspect.

35:49.810 --> 35:51.471
We could spend

35:51.510 --> 35:53.501
_ the next few months
d0ing genealogical research,

35:53.550 --> 35:55.871
but I think there might be
a more expeditious way

35:55.920 --> 35:58.639
to identify the murderous
Baskerville heir.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.454
I don't know.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.321
I suppose there could be
another heir,

36:05.360 --> 36:07.681
but he or she could've been born
anywhere in the world,

36:07.730 --> 36:09.425
at any time in the last century

36:09.460 --> 36:11.428
to any one of
several dozen people.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.530
True, but I believe there's
a way to find our needle

36:14.570 --> 36:16.891
without searching
a world full of haystacks.

36:18.740 --> 36:23.439
All you need to do is murder
your cousin, Rodger Stapleton.

36:28.450 --> 36:30.441
*

36:42.400 --> 36:44.868
(exhales deeply)

36:44.900 --> 36:46.265
(scoffs)

36:46.300 --> 36:48.359
It's, like, 100 degrees in here.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.868
It's precisely 95 degrees.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.868
Ideal for yoga and tortoises.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.999
I thought it best
not to overtax the furnace.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.679
Yeah, well, as long as you don't
set all those papers on fire.

36:59.710 --> 37:01.007
Reexamining the evidence

37:01.050 --> 37:03.314
will not help events
progress any faster.

37:03.350 --> 37:04.442
(sighs)

37:04.490 --> 37:06.344
So no news.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.483
Nothing as of yet.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.978
You know, it's been five days
since Henry killed Rodger.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.590
I'm well aware, thank you.

37:14.630 --> 37:16.848
What about Hawes?
Have you heard from him?

37:16.900 --> 37:18.322
(cell phone chimes)

37:20.630 --> 37:22.461
Finally.

37:22.500 --> 37:25.628
It appears our endgame
has begun.

37:25.670 --> 37:28.707
My Australian birth certiﬁcate,

37:28.740 --> 37:32.369
listing my father
as Ike Stapleton.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.617
You'll forgive my skepticism,

37:34.650 --> 37:38.040
but no one in the family has had
any contact with Ike Stapleton

37:38.080 --> 37:40.844
since he left the US. in 1972.

37:40.890 --> 37:44.519
He died when I was five.
Car crash.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.859
My mom says he was
a bit of a hippie.

37:47.890 --> 37:51.667
They weren't together long,
but she says I have his chin.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.724
I don't hear
an Australian accent.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.067
I lost it.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.898
Years ago, when I moved
to LA. for college.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.500
Look, I know I don't look much
like a Baskerville,

38:02.540 --> 38:05.941
and I know I kind of
just came out of nowhere,

38:05.980 --> 38:08.949
but I'm happy to take
a DNA test if you'd like.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.716
Of course.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.728
If you won't
take my word for it...

38:19.760 --> 38:21.455
take his.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.563
Uh, this is...

38:28.130 --> 38:29.495
Uncle Rodger

38:29.540 --> 38:31.565
tracked me down
when I was in college.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.965
We exchanged the occasional
e-mail over the years,

38:34.010 --> 38:36.899
and when I got my masters in
robotics, he offered me a job.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.874
He never mentioned
any of this to me.

38:38.910 --> 38:40.901
Or to the Baskervilles.

38:40.950 --> 38:42.975
And he never mentioned
the Baskervilles to me.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.442
Not once.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.481
I only found out
about the trust last week

38:46.520 --> 38:47.987
when the police came to see him.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.454
You know, all this time,
Ithought

38:50.490 --> 38:52.355
he tracked me down
to make up for the way

38:52.390 --> 38:56.394
he treated my father, but now I
wonder if he was setting me up.

38:56.430 --> 38:58.466
Setting you up?

38:58.500 --> 39:00.024
I would have made a good patsy

39:00.070 --> 39:02.789
for when he killed his cousins,
don't you think?

39:02.840 --> 39:03.864
(Holmes scoffs)

39:03.900 --> 39:06.039
What was that?

39:06.070 --> 39:07.765
I have some guests.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.046
HOLMES:
Good show, Miss Lyons.

39:14.080 --> 39:17.379
Quite clever of you to posit
that Rodger wanted to frame you,

39:17.420 --> 39:19.888
when in fact, you framed Rodger.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.080
Oh, that's right.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.678
You thought he was dead,
didn't you?

39:22.720 --> 39:24.529
Murdered by Henry here.

39:24.560 --> 39:28.087
Conveniently making you the
heir to the Baskerville trust.

39:28.130 --> 39:30.621
Well, it was
in all the papers.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.093
But you of all people
should know

39:32.130 --> 39:33.791
not to believe
everything you read.

39:33.830 --> 39:36.390
The e-mails she just handed over
were forgeries, right?

39:36.440 --> 39:38.738
I sure as hell
didn't write them.

39:38.770 --> 39:41.830
You tricked me.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.905
We created a vacuum,
and the heir rushed in.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.908
Or more specifically,
the heiress.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.942
WATSON: We recorded
your meeting with Miss Chambers.

39:48.980 --> 39:50.709
It doesn't prove
that you sent Gus Five

39:50.750 --> 39:53.048
after the Baskerville brothers,
but it should be enough

39:53.090 --> 39:55.581
for police to get a warrant
to search your home and car.

39:55.620 --> 39:58.088
Your plan was elaborate and
quite some time in the making,

39:58.120 --> 40:00.827
so it's hard to believe there
isn't some evidence to be found.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.429
It's true,

40:04.470 --> 40:06.665
she does have
your brother's chin.

40:10.170 --> 40:12.161
("Stories"

40:30.520 --> 40:33.728
Eugene. Come in.

40:33.760 --> 40:36.058
* Pages that need a rewrite...

40:36.100 --> 40:37.658
(clears throat)

40:37.700 --> 40:39.691
I, um...

40:39.730 --> 40:42.563
came by to give you these.

40:45.940 --> 40:48.067
Files on your fellow M.E.s?

40:48.110 --> 40:52.149
The three most likely to put up
with your, uh, visits.

40:52.180 --> 40:56.139
Pick one, and I will warn the
unluclq winner what to expect.

40:56.180 --> 40:59.149
So you're going somewhere.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.214
(sighs)

41:00.250 --> 41:01.979
You were right.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.612
As usual.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.127
I've been struggling.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.128
I told the chief M.E.
what's been going on,

41:07.160 --> 41:09.025
and, uh, we decided
it might be best for me

41:09.060 --> 41:11.221
_ to take medical leave_
till I can get my head straight.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.262
Until then, call me

41:13.300 --> 41:15.996
the P.T.S.D.M.E.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.133
Well, you'll be back.

41:18.170 --> 41:20.502
Maybe a month or two.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.872
Maybe never.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.777
I get, uh, offers all the time
to run my own morgue.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.903
Smaller cities, mostly.

41:27.950 --> 41:29.838
Portsmouth, Tucson,

41:29.880 --> 41:31.609
Boise.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.242
More pay, less stress.

41:33.290 --> 41:34.245
(chuckles)

41:34.290 --> 41:35.917
Fewer memories.

41:37.690 --> 41:40.284
Well, any one of them's
going to be lucky to have you.

41:40.330 --> 41:43.754
I'm just thinking it over
so far.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.791
I'll keep you posted.

41:45.830 --> 41:48.219
But, in case
I decide to move on...

41:49.900 --> 41:52.539
...thank you.

41:52.570 --> 41:54.902
For bullying some sense into me.

41:54.940 --> 41:58.171
What are bullies for?

41:58.210 --> 42:01.008
* We leave behind...

42:01.050 --> 42:02.017
(sighs)

42:02.050 --> 42:03.779
* Stories

42:03.820 --> 42:06.584
* Ooh-ooh *

42:06.620 --> 42:09.680
* Ooh-ooh... *

42:09.720 --> 42:14.123
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh *

42:14.160 --> 42:15.821
* Stories

42:15.860 --> 42:17.919
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... *
