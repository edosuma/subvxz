00:01.540 --> 00:04.040
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:04.040 --> 00:05.120
Michaela: I cheated on you
with Asher.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.250
You made a mistake.
Mistakes happen.

00:06.250 --> 00:07.120
Your feelings for her
are absolutely not real.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.290
Michaela:
Asher -- Oh, my God!

00:08.290 --> 00:09.460
-Aah!
-Just stop!

00:09.460 --> 00:11.080
What about letting someone
get close?

00:11.080 --> 00:12.920
You are not ready
for this.

00:12.920 --> 00:13.670
Try me.

00:15.500 --> 00:16.920
You can tell me anything.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.540
Do you know if Ron was
in contact with the Governor?

00:19.540 --> 00:22.670
No, I don't remember him
talking much about the Governor.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.830
Who gave you the order?
D.A. Miller.

00:24.830 --> 00:26.540
We're filing a wrongful death
suit against the state.

00:26.540 --> 00:27.830
You're naming
the Governor?

00:27.830 --> 00:29.620
Annalise: You're going to
scare Tegan from filing.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.170
The Castillos
got to me.

00:31.170 --> 00:32.500
God forbid I'm gonna
let them do to Cora

00:32.500 --> 00:34.040
what they did
to your father.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.210
I'll file it.
I'm your lawyer.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.380
Get me everything
we have on Ms. Winterbottom

00:38.380 --> 00:39.830
by morning.
You got it.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.210
Connor: I never told you
about that night.

00:41.210 --> 00:42.460
No, you haven't.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.540
I was the one
who chopped up the body.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.710
I did it! Arrest me!

00:45.710 --> 00:47.040
I'm the murderer!

00:49.790 --> 00:53.500
Annalise: Welcome to your final
final criminal law exam --

00:53.500 --> 00:57.790
your last chance to convince me
that you deserve to graduate.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.960
Now, in your packets
is your client's file.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.920
You have 10 minutes
to review the case,

01:02.920 --> 01:04.120
come up with a defense,

01:04.120 --> 01:06.420
and argue against me.

01:06.420 --> 01:10.540
Whoever comes up with
the best defense wins this.

01:10.540 --> 01:14.500
The 64-K C&G bonus
that no one won last semester.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.040
If either of us wins,
we split the money.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.620
When I win,

01:17.620 --> 01:18.880
I'm keeping that money
for me.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.620
Now, I will pick names
to determine the order.

01:23.620 --> 01:25.420
Once someone tries
a strategy,

01:25.420 --> 01:26.960
it's off the table
for good.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.830
So the person who goes last
has more time to know the case?

01:29.830 --> 01:32.500
It's as unfair
as the American justice system.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.540
Now, today's case?

01:34.540 --> 01:37.040
Is a conspiracy to murder.

01:38.790 --> 01:42.920
The client? Is a famous,
powerful, legendary woman.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.620
Her name...?

01:45.620 --> 01:47.830
Snow White.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.040
The prosecution alleges
that Ms. White

01:52.040 --> 01:54.210
manipulated
the Seven Dwarfs

01:54.210 --> 01:56.670
to push her stepmother,
the Queen,

01:56.670 --> 02:00.210
over a cliff.

02:00.210 --> 02:04.290
Ms. White claims
that the Dwarfs acted alone.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.540
Now, the rest of the details
are in your packets.

02:08.540 --> 02:10.710
Your 10 minutes start...

02:12.750 --> 02:14.120
Now.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.380
Man: Governor, what's your
response to Nate Lahey's claim

02:21.380 --> 02:22.880
that you conspired
to kill his father?

02:22.880 --> 02:25.120
The only conspiracy here
is against me.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.460
Mr. Lahey's suit states
there's proof

02:26.460 --> 02:27.750
you were involved
in the murder.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.880
Fake news.
Aren't you
at all concerned

02:29.880 --> 02:32.790
that this wrongful death suit
could lead to criminal charges?

02:32.790 --> 02:35.620
My concern here
is for Mr. Lahey.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.580
He's pointing his grief
in the wrong direction.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.500
It was Emmett Crawford
who conspired

02:40.500 --> 02:42.670
to kill Nathaniel Lahey Senior,
not me...

02:42.670 --> 02:44.880
Then why doesn't the suit name
Mr. Crawford?

02:44.880 --> 02:48.330
Because Mr. Lahey's attorney
is leading him astray.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.380
Do you think Ms. Winterbottom
has a conflict of interest?

02:50.380 --> 02:52.620
That's up for the Judge
to decide...

02:52.620 --> 02:54.540
As my client, you have
the power to waive

02:54.540 --> 02:56.080
any conflict of interest.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.210
I'm filing the waiver
with the judge this morning.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.000
What?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.670
You're good.

03:02.670 --> 03:04.290
You're just
realizing that?

03:04.290 --> 03:05.500
Man: Do you believe
Emmett Crawford

03:05.500 --> 03:07.040
bribed D.A. Miller
to take part in the murder?

03:07.040 --> 03:08.250
I have no idea.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.380
I imagine the FBI
will be able

03:10.380 --> 03:11.830
to shed more light on that

03:11.830 --> 03:14.920
once they release the results
of their investigation.

03:14.920 --> 03:19.040
I don't think this suit
was about money for Mr. Lahey.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.080
That said,
grief is a powerful emotion

03:21.080 --> 03:22.830
that can cloud
anyone's judgment...

03:22.830 --> 03:24.380
Is it bad that I agree
with her?

03:24.380 --> 03:26.080
Tell Bonnie. She's the idiot
that took the case.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.000
Which is none
of our business.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.960
So, let's study.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.170
Okay, any chance
she'd do O.J.?

03:30.170 --> 03:31.080
Too obvious.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.460
Uh...Al Capone?

03:32.460 --> 03:34.170
He was AK's exam
in '05.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.960
Lizzie Borden?
Leopold and Loeb?

03:35.960 --> 03:38.330
Green smoothies
with omega-3 shots!

03:38.330 --> 03:39.960
-Perfect brain food.
-That and Adderall.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.040
Throw some ganja
in there --

03:41.040 --> 03:42.290
that's my type
of study bud.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.580
If we fail,
we don't graduate.

03:43.580 --> 03:44.790
You do both realize that,
right?

03:44.790 --> 03:46.250
There is no way
that Annalise

03:46.250 --> 03:47.710
is gonna fail you all
at this point.

03:47.710 --> 03:49.080
Of course she would.
Hell, yeah, she'd fail us.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.290
What's it matter? We're at
the bottom of our class, anyway.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.040
Not true.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.210
You're 98th out of 123.

03:54.210 --> 03:55.670
At a top law school.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.670
That doesn't mean
you're gonna work at a top firm.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.500
I have a solution. We should
just form our own law firm --

03:59.500 --> 04:01.420
Millstone, Millstone,
and Walsh.

04:01.420 --> 04:02.790
Where am I?
You're the second Millstone

04:02.790 --> 04:04.040
after we get betrothed.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.420
I'm gonna graduate,
pass the bar,

04:05.420 --> 04:07.040
and have
an incredible legal career.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.210
Oh, Casey Anthony?

04:08.210 --> 04:09.620
Ew.
Why?

04:09.620 --> 04:11.670
No, not the case --
the smoothie.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.170
Really gross, Ols.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.880
Annalise: Congrats.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.620
The Governor
knows your name now.

04:39.620 --> 04:42.670
Nate was gonna file this
with or without me.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.250
At least this way,
we're the ones managing him.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.000
And who's managing you?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.500
That's not why you're here
right now?

04:48.500 --> 04:49.670
They killed Emmett,

04:49.670 --> 04:51.380
they almost beat Frank
to death.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.040
You don't think they're gonna do
the same thing to you?

04:53.040 --> 04:56.670
What happened to you
in rehab?

04:56.670 --> 04:59.080
You came home afraid,

04:59.080 --> 05:00.830
hiding behind
restraining orders.

05:00.830 --> 05:03.040
Any time we've hit back
at those people,

05:03.040 --> 05:05.460
they've come at us
even harder.

05:05.460 --> 05:08.380
This is what you've always
wanted for me --

05:08.380 --> 05:11.170
to stand up and fight.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.420
Be proud of me.

05:12.420 --> 05:15.330
Bonnie...

05:15.330 --> 05:17.380
This isn't your fight.

05:34.170 --> 05:36.120
Isn't this the penthouse?

05:36.120 --> 05:37.670
Send me a copy of
the Winterbottom file tonight.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.080
No problem.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.040
Frank:
Maybe we sit this one out?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.540
Let Bonnie do her thing
in court,

05:50.540 --> 05:51.920
pray Miller stays guilty.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.250
Pray?

05:53.250 --> 05:55.040
God works
in mysterious ways.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.330
God wants us
to keep Bonnie alive.

05:57.330 --> 06:00.250
Or did you already go back
to loving Laurel?

06:00.250 --> 06:02.420
Don't act like I'm the only one
with skin in this game.

06:02.420 --> 06:03.500
I never said you were.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.620
I mean Nate.

06:04.620 --> 06:05.670
No way you're done
with that guy.

06:05.670 --> 06:07.210
Oh, shut your damn mouth.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.290
You're talking
about tanking a case

06:09.290 --> 06:11.880
that could get the guy some
damn peace about his father --

06:11.880 --> 06:14.540
Enough.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.830
She was screwing a man
that she's accusing of murder.

06:16.830 --> 06:18.580
The conflict of interest
is insane.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.290
Bonnie already filed
the waiver.

06:20.290 --> 06:22.210
Well, we have to make it
sound worse...

06:24.880 --> 06:25.960
You got something?

06:27.960 --> 06:30.210
Get Bonnie's phone records.

06:33.330 --> 06:34.790
Judge Bonaparte:
Before we bring in the jury,

06:34.790 --> 06:37.380
I understand the
Attorney General has a request.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.120
Your Honor, the State
wants a hearing

06:39.120 --> 06:41.710
on Ms. Winterbottom's conflict
of interest in this case.

06:41.710 --> 06:43.790
My relationship
with Ronald Miller

06:43.790 --> 06:45.540
pre-dates my knowledge
of any information

06:45.540 --> 06:46.960
linking him
to the conspiracy.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.250
It's not Ms. Winterbottom's
relationship

06:48.250 --> 06:49.790
with D.A. Miller
that's the conflict,

06:49.790 --> 06:51.880
it's her relationship
with his mother.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.710
Here we have
phone records

06:53.710 --> 06:55.540
proving that Ms. Winterbottom
and Mrs. Miller

06:55.540 --> 06:57.540
spoke frequently
after his death.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.380
In addition, Your Honor,
we'd like to call Sheila Miller

06:59.380 --> 07:00.880
to testify here today.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.080
Mrs. Miller, Bonnie Winterbottom
has accused your son

07:11.080 --> 07:12.750
of being involved
in a murder,

07:12.750 --> 07:15.500
yet you spoke on the phone
with her many times. Why?

07:15.500 --> 07:18.620
Sheila: Well, at first, Bonnie
didn't accuse Ron of anything.

07:18.620 --> 07:21.420
In fact, she told me
she thought he was innocent.

07:21.420 --> 07:22.880
And she was going
to help me prove it.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.460
Objection to relevancy.

07:24.460 --> 07:25.920
It speaks
to Ms. Winterbottom's motives

07:25.920 --> 07:28.210
in bringing this case.

07:28.210 --> 07:29.750
I'll allow it.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.500
Mrs. Miller, do you think
Ms. Winterbottom

07:32.500 --> 07:35.420
ever actually cared about you
or your son?

07:35.420 --> 07:38.750
When Ron died,
there was so much pain,

07:38.750 --> 07:42.830
and I needed someone
t-to share it with me.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.120
And that person was Bonnie.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.290
But it was all lies.
All of it.

07:49.290 --> 07:50.920
You're sick.
You're really sick.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.000
Judge Bonaparte:
Mrs. Miller, please.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.330
Why are you doing this?
Is it for money?

07:54.330 --> 07:56.290
Your Honor, I have nothing
further for Mrs. Miller.

07:59.710 --> 08:02.710
Ms. Winterbottom, you have
any questions for the witness?

08:02.710 --> 08:04.380
No, Your Honor.
Because this testimony

08:04.380 --> 08:06.330
doesn't change the fact
that Mr. Lahey

08:06.330 --> 08:08.460
expressly waived
any conflicts.

08:08.460 --> 08:12.000
And yet now I find that conflict
too severe.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.080
I'm siding with
the Attorney General on this.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.500
Mr. Lahey, I suggest you
find another lawyer

08:16.500 --> 08:17.790
and refile the suit.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.040
Tegan:
No need, Your Honor.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.830
Tegan Price, Managing Partner
at Caplan & Gold.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.290
I'll step in
and take the case.

08:23.290 --> 08:25.420
Your Honor, Ms. Price's
conflict of interest

08:25.420 --> 08:26.710
is equally glaring.

08:26.710 --> 08:28.580
Conjecture by the defense
has no bearing

08:28.580 --> 08:29.880
on a conflict determination.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.830
Frank: Bonnie got kicked off
the case.

08:31.830 --> 08:33.330
Good job.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.380
Except now Tegan's
the lawyer.

08:35.380 --> 08:36.620
What?

08:36.620 --> 08:39.250
Judge just okayed
change of counsel.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.920
Trial's on.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.040
Time's up.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.170
Our first victim is...

08:52.170 --> 08:53.670
Mr. Maddox.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.000
You have three minutes.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.830
A conspiracy is an agreement
between two or more people

08:57.830 --> 08:59.330
to commit a crime.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.920
But the nature of this
agreement, to kill the Queen,

09:01.920 --> 09:04.290
is a matter of Snow White's word
versus an informant's.

09:04.290 --> 09:06.290
Now, if I want the jury
to acquit my client,

09:06.290 --> 09:07.710
they need
to hear her side...

09:07.710 --> 09:10.460
which is why my strategy is
to put Snow White on the stand.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.420
Rookie mistake.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.000
Most defense lawyers
advise their clients

09:14.000 --> 09:15.460
to avoid testifying.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.670
Snow White's likable.
She's smart, friendly.

09:18.670 --> 09:20.380
It'll be really hard
for a jury to believe

09:20.380 --> 09:21.790
she'd ever conspire
to murder anyone.

09:21.790 --> 09:24.460
But once she's up there, you
can't control what she'll say.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.080
It's a necessary risk.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.000
Tegan: Hells no are we putting
the Governor on the stand first!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.250
-That's always been the plan.
-Your plan.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.120
My plan is to start
with the grunts at the bottom,

09:34.120 --> 09:35.500
the guards
who killed Senior.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.580
The mean-looking one first.

09:36.580 --> 09:38.710
We can't put Gladden
on the stand.

09:38.710 --> 09:40.250
Why?
I only got her to admit

09:40.250 --> 09:42.380
that Ron ordered the hit
by offering her immunity.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.790
I got fired
before I could do that.

09:43.790 --> 09:46.210
So why does that mean we skip
right to the Governor?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.620
Show her.

09:51.540 --> 09:53.670
What happened to being scared
for Cora's life?

09:53.670 --> 09:56.580
She's on assignment
for the government

09:56.580 --> 09:58.620
somewhere in the Middle East
with a security detail.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.580
But you raise
a compelling point.

10:00.580 --> 10:01.960
I don't have to do this.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.540
I can go home,
run a bubble bath --

10:03.540 --> 10:05.540
ooh, I love bubble baths --
and drink gin.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.210
Here.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.330
It's the Governor's car.

10:14.330 --> 10:15.500
And?

10:15.500 --> 10:17.040
It's outside
Ron's apartment.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.460
Just days
before Senior's murder.

10:26.790 --> 10:29.170
Asher:
They're boning, huh?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.040
Do you know that?
No, but how upset
you just got

10:31.040 --> 10:33.500
breaks my heart a little.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.620
Tegan took over
Nate's civil suit.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.080
Why?
Bonnie got kicked off.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.750
Do you think, if he wins,
he'll share his millions?

10:38.750 --> 10:40.250
Good news!

10:40.250 --> 10:42.080
I hacked into Middleton

10:42.080 --> 10:43.880
and found all
of your admissions essays.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.000
Why?
You've all been so down
about your futures,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.460
I thought you need
a little reminder

10:47.460 --> 10:49.500
about why you came to law school
in the first place.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.880
God, you're such a nerd.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.540
"After completing a clerkship
for Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

10:54.540 --> 10:55.710
I plan to join

10:55.710 --> 10:57.420
the Legal Assistance Corp
of California

10:57.420 --> 10:59.250
in hopes of running
for Attorney General."

10:59.250 --> 11:00.460
Ugh!

11:00.460 --> 11:02.290
Then governor,
then eventually the White House.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.080
Fat chance
of that happening now.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.420
They've let worse
into the White House.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.000
Oliver: Okay, next --

11:07.000 --> 11:09.080
"Ever since I became
openly gay,

11:09.080 --> 11:12.920
I've wanted to be a role model
for the LGBTQ youth..."

11:12.920 --> 11:14.620
-Awww, so cute.
-That's inspiring!

11:14.620 --> 11:15.750
You brought a tear
to my eye.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.710
Just get on with Asher's.
Okay.

11:17.710 --> 11:21.250
"My plan is to become a
prosecutor in the D.A.'s office

11:21.250 --> 11:22.710
before running
for a judgeship

11:22.710 --> 11:25.750
and ultimately becoming
a federal circuit judge..."

11:25.750 --> 11:27.580
So basically your dad.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.750
Except I became morally corrupt
in a worse way.

11:29.750 --> 11:30.920
Lower your voice.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.420
Whatever. Oli's right.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.750
I feel better now,
murders be damned.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.000
Shh! Come on.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.540
You're gonna lose.
I hope you know that.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.580
Thank you for the encouragement,
friend.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.040
What about Cora?

11:43.040 --> 11:44.790
Last I heard,
you were afraid for her life.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.210
I got over that.

11:46.210 --> 11:48.420
Alright, so what's going on?
Your ego?

11:48.420 --> 11:50.330
'Cause wearing that crown
comes with a heavy price.

11:50.330 --> 11:51.500
I've been wearing
that heavy-ass crown

11:51.500 --> 11:52.920
for a long time,
Annalise.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.000
Well, you haven't been running
this place for very long.

11:55.000 --> 11:55.830
I'm talking about before.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.250
Before when?

11:58.250 --> 11:59.460
I'm not talking
about this here.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.790
You brought it up.
You know all my crap, so go.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.080
I want to understand.

12:06.670 --> 12:10.500
You know I lost
my whole family.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.420
Plane crash.

12:12.420 --> 12:16.210
And, uh, how I coped
with that...

12:16.210 --> 12:19.000
Well, it was Jorge
who helped me.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.670
How?
It doesn't matter.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.120
I-I'm your friend, Tegan.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.420
All you need to know is
that asking for Jorge's help

12:24.420 --> 12:25.790
put me under his thumb.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.920
And I'm tired of being
under any man's thumb.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.080
So screw him,
screw the Governor...

12:30.080 --> 12:31.380
I want to be free.

12:31.380 --> 12:34.120
You of all people
understand that.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.580
You want my help?

12:35.580 --> 12:36.670
No.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.460
You're putting the Governor
on the stand.

12:42.460 --> 12:46.540
Oh, I get it now,
you're jealous.

12:46.540 --> 12:47.540
Fine.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.380
Then I don't have to cancel
my date tonight.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.330
Robert again?

12:53.330 --> 12:55.830
Now who's jealous?

12:59.120 --> 13:00.210
Robert: You know,
I half-expected

13:00.210 --> 13:02.000
you to cancel on me
tonight.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.750
I already bought
all the ingredients.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.830
How flattering.
Yeah.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.620
What I meant was...

13:09.620 --> 13:11.250
I'm surprised

13:11.250 --> 13:13.920
that you're not helping
Tegan out with the civil suit.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.290
It's her case, not mine.

13:15.290 --> 13:16.790
Yeah, but you're the one
that took the Governor on

13:16.790 --> 13:18.250
at the Supreme Court.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.120
How can you not want
to face her in open court?

13:20.120 --> 13:21.830
I don't think the case
is winnable.

13:21.830 --> 13:24.290
I'm sorry?
Am I hearing this correctly?

13:24.290 --> 13:26.330
The great slayer
of all dragons,

13:26.330 --> 13:29.330
rage-against-the-machine
Ms. Annalise Keating,

13:29.330 --> 13:31.000
who I am not
an expert on yet.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.710
Clearly.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.460
But I do know this --

13:34.460 --> 13:37.000
you do not anticipate defeat
in the courtroom.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.830
Unless you distancing yourself
from the case

13:38.830 --> 13:40.540
has something to do
with the fact

13:40.540 --> 13:42.880
that the client
is your ex.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.330
There's plenty of photos
of the guy online.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.710
By the way,
he's, like, 90% muscle.

13:51.710 --> 13:55.080
Do you expect me to look
like that under this shirt?

13:55.080 --> 13:57.460
The state killed Nate Senior
because of me.

13:57.460 --> 13:59.000
Revenge
for my SCOTUS win --

13:59.000 --> 14:00.920
the one
you keep bringing up.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.580
I'm staying away
this time.

14:03.580 --> 14:04.750
Don't tell me I'm wrong.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.330
I'm not.

14:06.330 --> 14:10.290
I'm just learning
when to stop fighting, is all.

14:10.290 --> 14:11.540
You seem to like fighting
with me.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.960
Please.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.120
We haven't even gotten
close to a fight.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.670
You'll know, believe me.

14:44.580 --> 14:48.000
Need a hand?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.580
Tegan's sending
a messenger.

14:52.580 --> 14:54.380
I'm going to bed.

15:04.540 --> 15:08.170
His mother doesn't know
a damn thing about you.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.460
It was just
the grief talking.

15:17.460 --> 15:20.000
Good night.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.250
Tegan: Governor, have you ever
met or spoken to

15:32.250 --> 15:34.880
former District Attorney
Ronald Miller?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.290
Not that I recall.

15:36.290 --> 15:38.380
But I --
I meet a lot of people.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.210
So you never discussed
Nathaniel Lahey's

15:40.210 --> 15:41.420
Supreme Court case
with him?

15:41.420 --> 15:42.750
No.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.420
Or getting back
at Annalise Keating

15:44.420 --> 15:45.460
for embarrassing you?

15:45.460 --> 15:47.380
Objection,
asked and answered.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.960
That's okay. No.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.750
And I would remember
if someone had embarrassed me.

15:53.540 --> 15:56.460
Governor, how many cars
does the State give you

15:56.460 --> 15:57.670
for official business?

15:57.670 --> 16:01.210
One, but I have access to others
if necessary.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.380
Is anyone else authorized
to use the official one?

16:03.380 --> 16:04.620
Not to my knowledge.

16:04.620 --> 16:07.080
Is this your car
for official business?

16:10.040 --> 16:11.500
I believe so.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.620
This image was taken
by a street camera

16:13.620 --> 16:16.460
outside of Ronald Miller's
residence on October 25th,

16:16.460 --> 16:21.620
just days before
Nathaniel Lahey was killed.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.580
You said
you never met Miller.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.210
How do you explain it
being there?

16:29.710 --> 16:31.460
I can't.

16:35.790 --> 16:37.170
No further questions.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.290
Governor, why did you fire
your aide Paige Dodson?

16:43.290 --> 16:45.040
Objection, relevance.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.500
Laying foundation,
Judge.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.920
I'll allow it.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.620
Go ahead.

16:50.620 --> 16:55.040
Paige showed a pattern of
unprofessional decision making.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.620
Booking your official car
for her own personal use?

16:58.620 --> 17:00.250
Several times.

17:00.250 --> 17:04.880
And each time, she had
to fill out a requisition form

17:04.880 --> 17:08.080
like this, correct?

17:08.080 --> 17:09.420
Yes.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.750
Can you tell us the date
written there?

17:11.750 --> 17:13.790
October 25th.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.580
The same night the car was
parked near Mr. Miller's home.

17:16.580 --> 17:19.460
Are you accusing my aide
of conspiring with D.A. Miller?

17:19.460 --> 17:21.750
No. But Paige was seeing
a gentleman friend

17:21.750 --> 17:23.250
who lives
near Mr. Miller's building.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.120
This is hearsay unless
Ms. Dodson testifies herself.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.290
She's out of the country.

17:27.290 --> 17:29.420
But we have the gentleman,
Joseph Lee, here

17:29.420 --> 17:30.920
to testify to the relationship,
Your Honor.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.500
Permission to call him
to the stand?

17:32.500 --> 17:35.380
I think the jury would
appreciate hearing from him.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.000
Governor,
you may step down.

17:45.710 --> 17:47.210
Annalise: I told you
the Governor would sell out

17:47.210 --> 17:48.710
all the people
below her...

17:48.710 --> 17:51.000
She doesn't care who she has
to throw under the bus or bribe.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.210
Okay, if you're just here to rub
salt in our wounds, leave.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.380
What if I know how to win?

17:55.330 --> 17:56.620
How?

17:56.620 --> 17:58.000
Stop going after
the Governor

17:58.000 --> 17:59.170
and take out
the one person

17:59.170 --> 18:01.830
who you know ordered
Senior's murder.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.580
Miller.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.620
Gladden won't say that
on the stand without immunity.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.210
But you have another witness
right here.

18:08.210 --> 18:10.380
You figured out Miller
was guilty before anyone else.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.380
Tell the jury why.

18:11.380 --> 18:12.920
Okay.
That's not a terrible idea.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.580
Nah.
Why?

18:14.580 --> 18:16.750
Miller's mom already made Bonnie
a liability, that's why.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.880
The jury
didn't see that.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.580
And as his
one-time girlfriend,

18:19.580 --> 18:20.960
the jury will believe
Miller told her things

18:20.960 --> 18:23.750
he told no one else.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.500
Unless you disagree?

18:34.210 --> 18:36.830
Annalise: Mr. Millstone.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.210
I've decided to have Ms. White
plead guilty.

18:43.210 --> 18:44.880
You want Snow White
to go to prison?

18:44.880 --> 18:47.080
I'll negotiate an immunity deal
for no jail time.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.620
One of the Dwarfs already made
a deal,

18:48.620 --> 18:50.040
that's how the police
got enough evidence

18:50.040 --> 18:51.420
to arrest Snow White.

18:51.420 --> 18:52.960
Probably Doc,
total evil mastermind name.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.420
But whatever Dwarf it was,

18:55.420 --> 18:57.000
we know this to be true --
he's a man.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.670
And this is olden times,
where women are even more

18:58.670 --> 19:00.670
subjugated by men
than they presently are,

19:00.670 --> 19:04.080
so I'll argue that Ms. White
was a victim of male toxicity.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.500
She felt afraid and bullied,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.580
and she had no choice
but to act in a conspiracy

19:07.580 --> 19:08.750
to murder another woman.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.880
It was kill or be killed.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.290
And she chose life.

19:13.290 --> 19:15.040
How can we blame her
for that?

19:22.540 --> 19:24.380
Bonnie is about
to take the stand,

19:24.380 --> 19:26.170
which means she's about
to become the star witness

19:26.170 --> 19:28.040
in the case
she got kicked off of,

19:28.040 --> 19:29.290
which means the case
is tanked

19:29.290 --> 19:31.920
and there's no way that Nate
is getting any money...

19:33.920 --> 19:35.210
You're such a loser.

19:35.210 --> 19:36.420
I know.

19:37.670 --> 19:38.790
Hey. Oh!

19:38.790 --> 19:40.080
Sorry.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.790
All good.

19:41.790 --> 19:44.460
Uh, thank you for still
sending me your tax law outline.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.330
Yeah, of course.
We had a deal.

19:46.330 --> 19:49.120
Yeah, I know,
but that was before, you know...

19:50.920 --> 19:52.880
You and Asher
back together again?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.080
No.
Really?

19:54.080 --> 19:55.540
Because I can feel his eyes

19:55.540 --> 19:57.500
burning a hole in the back
of my head all week.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.540
What?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.420
And I meant what I said
about wanting to be single.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.580
Yeah, I mean, you --

20:05.580 --> 20:06.670
you say a lot of things,
though.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.790
Excuse me?

20:08.790 --> 20:12.290
I'm just saying you claim
to be this independent woman,

20:12.290 --> 20:14.380
but from what I hear?

20:14.380 --> 20:16.120
You've been with a guy
almost your entire time

20:16.120 --> 20:17.960
here in law school.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.170
Did Peyton tell you that?

20:19.170 --> 20:21.420
So it's true?
You are a hypocrite.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.210
I don't need a man in my life
to make me feel good.

20:24.210 --> 20:26.620
You sure, considering
the whole dad stuff?

20:26.620 --> 20:29.000
Are you...

20:29.000 --> 20:31.170
I don't have daddy issues.

20:31.170 --> 20:33.750
You make one bad choice of a guy
after the next, Michaela.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.670
Hey, study buddy.

20:35.670 --> 20:36.750
Ready to grind?

20:36.750 --> 20:38.210
Yeah, you bet.

20:38.210 --> 20:39.710
Thank you.

20:40.830 --> 20:42.540
Peyton's really smart.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.040
What'd he say to you?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.330
I'm fine.

20:53.330 --> 20:55.120
I'm fine.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.170
A.G. Chavez:
Ms. Winterbottom, would you say

21:00.170 --> 21:02.670
you and Ronald Miller
were in love?

21:02.670 --> 21:04.170
Yes.
So how did you
come to believe

21:04.170 --> 21:07.210
that Ronald was involved
in Nathaniel Lahey's murder?

21:07.210 --> 21:09.710
I received first-hand
information from someone

21:09.710 --> 21:12.540
that the murder
was orchestrated by Ron.

21:12.540 --> 21:15.040
Does this someone have
a name?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.250
I can't give you their name
without putting them,

21:17.250 --> 21:18.920
and their family,
in serious danger.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.330
Or you're making it all up

21:20.330 --> 21:22.330
to win a huge settlement
for your friend?

21:24.330 --> 21:26.120
I loved Ron.

21:26.120 --> 21:30.540
But now I am here telling
all of you that I was fooled.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.380
With anonymous hearsay.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.460
I tried to give
this person immunity

21:34.460 --> 21:36.420
when I worked at the D.A.
Before you were fired
by the FBI

21:36.420 --> 21:38.080
for fabricating
a criminal record?

21:38.080 --> 21:40.500
Objection!
Goes to credibility.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.040
Overruled.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.460
I was fired
for going after the truth.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.170
Which is what
you should be after, too.

21:47.170 --> 21:48.670
All any of us here want
is the truth.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.420
No, you want to protect
the Governor.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.290
Because I won't let you make up
fake witnesses

21:52.290 --> 21:53.790
the way you made up
a fake criminal record?

21:53.790 --> 21:56.540
This person is real --
they know what happened.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.330
So if you actually want
to hear it,

21:58.330 --> 22:01.670
all you have to do
is give them immunity.

22:01.670 --> 22:03.580
Agree to that,

22:03.580 --> 22:05.040
then I'll give you
their name.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.330
Tegan:
Whew, is it hot in here?

22:08.330 --> 22:10.710
Winterbottom turned the heat
all the way up!

22:10.710 --> 22:13.420
Now the State has
to grant Gladden immunity

22:13.420 --> 22:15.250
or the jury will think
they're shady.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.380
Girl, yes!

22:17.380 --> 22:19.710
If Gladden testifies,
we don't know what she'll say.

22:19.710 --> 22:22.420
I'll break her.
If you don't,
our case is dead.

22:22.420 --> 22:25.290
We lost our only chance
to take out the Governor.

22:25.290 --> 22:28.120
Let's see if Gladden
gets her immunity,

22:28.120 --> 22:31.380
and then we can plan
next steps.

22:31.380 --> 22:33.170
Bad news.

22:33.170 --> 22:34.960
The A.G. gave Gladden
immunity.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.170
She's testifying tomorrow.

22:37.170 --> 22:38.960
Don't worry.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.040
She hasn't forgotten me.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.540
This is
ADA Winterbottom's number.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.670
Tell her
Miller ordered the hit.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.830
Do whatever
you have to do.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.500
Not a problem.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.040
Michaela: Just like you
taught us Day 1

23:05.040 --> 23:06.380
of our first year
of law school,

23:06.380 --> 23:07.330
I found a better suspect
than Snow White for this murder.

23:07.330 --> 23:09.040
Kinda basic going
to your 1L days,

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
isn't it, Ms. Pratt?

23:10.040 --> 23:12.500
Basic or obvious?

23:12.500 --> 23:14.460
I'm just surprised that none
of you other 18 people

23:14.460 --> 23:16.880
came up
with this other suspect --

23:16.880 --> 23:18.790
Snow White's father,
the King.

23:18.790 --> 23:20.290
He framed
his own daughter?

23:20.290 --> 23:22.500
Yes.
What evidence
can you present the jury?

23:22.500 --> 23:25.120
The statistic that
30,000 women worldwide

23:25.120 --> 23:26.880
are killed by intimate partners
every year.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.500
The King also had power
and money

23:28.500 --> 23:29.920
to command his henchmen
to do his bidding

23:29.920 --> 23:31.380
and keep their mouths shut
after.

23:31.380 --> 23:33.750
Power is how you form
a viable conspiracy.

23:33.750 --> 23:35.500
This is all
circumstantial inference.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.670
Doesn't matter.
We're convincing a jury.

23:37.670 --> 23:39.000
And regular folks
love to believe

23:39.000 --> 23:40.420
that the most
successful people,

23:40.420 --> 23:43.210
"elites," if you will,
are hypocrites.

23:43.210 --> 23:44.790
Whether it's true or not,
the jury will believe

23:44.790 --> 23:46.170
that the rich husband
did it

23:46.170 --> 23:48.920
just so that their lives don't
seem so small by comparison.

23:56.830 --> 23:58.920
You're the rebound,
idiot.

24:00.420 --> 24:02.460
Did somebody call Gustav?

24:02.460 --> 24:04.250
Our book-upuncture special

24:04.250 --> 24:08.380
is good
for maximum relaxation.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.580
Stop.

24:10.580 --> 24:11.880
What'd he say to you?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.080
He called me a hypocrite.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.330
I'll destroy him.

24:14.330 --> 24:16.250
What if he's right?

24:16.250 --> 24:18.040
I claim to be
this badass feminist,

24:18.040 --> 24:20.120
but maybe I'm really just afraid
of being alone.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.500
That just makes you
a person.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.960
A normal person.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.500
I want to be better.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.960
I got to be honest --
all this makes it really hard

24:25.960 --> 24:28.960
not to want to punch
his face in again.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.420
It's not about him.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.290
He said mean things to you,
and now you feel bad.

24:33.290 --> 24:35.710
And we did things to him,
Asher.

24:35.710 --> 24:37.920
I mean, think about that.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.580
He came here to find out things
about his father --

24:39.580 --> 24:43.040
his --
his father, who I...

24:43.040 --> 24:44.750
I mean, it's our fault.

24:44.750 --> 24:45.670
What the hell?!

24:45.670 --> 24:46.960
I'm sorry.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.040
I should've asked.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.000
Go home.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I'm sorry.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.790
Just let me study.

25:03.790 --> 25:04.830
I'm too tired
to come over.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.670
And I already ate.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.670
Let me make you
something real.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.170
I just want to see you.

25:10.170 --> 25:11.920
I'm okay.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.380
Honestly.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.620
Just ignore
whatever Frank told you.

25:16.620 --> 25:18.540
I'm not calling about Frank.

25:18.540 --> 25:19.920
He did tell me what's going on,
though.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.290
What?

25:23.290 --> 25:25.330
He told me
he wants to be with you.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.580
And you?

25:34.500 --> 25:37.290
Are you asking so that
you can get involved again?

25:37.290 --> 25:39.750
You know
that wasn't me.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.420
I don't, actually.

25:41.420 --> 25:42.790
See, the fact
that you say that

25:42.790 --> 25:44.580
tells me that you're upset
with me.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.580
I'm upset with Frank,

25:46.580 --> 25:47.790
but maybe that was
your whole point

25:47.790 --> 25:49.750
of bringing
any of this up.

25:49.750 --> 25:52.620
Listen. I want
whatever you want, Bonnie.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.420
I don't know
what I want yet.

25:57.420 --> 25:58.420
Okay.

25:58.420 --> 25:59.620
Sorry.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.170
Forget I even brought it up.

26:03.290 --> 26:04.540
Annalise.

26:04.540 --> 26:06.330
Oh, my God,
my brakes aren't working.

26:06.330 --> 26:07.170
Bonnie?

26:07.170 --> 26:08.080
I can't stop!

26:08.080 --> 26:09.500
Oh, my God!

26:09.500 --> 26:10.710
Help!
Bonnie?

26:10.710 --> 26:11.420
Help!

26:11.420 --> 26:12.670
Help!

26:12.670 --> 26:14.330
Bonnie!

26:14.330 --> 26:16.040
Gladden: The state gave me
immunity so that I'll testify.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.620
That's the point --

26:17.620 --> 26:19.290
they can't arrest me
for anything I say in court.

26:19.290 --> 26:21.380
Uh-huh.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.710
Of course I'm scared,
but you're not getting it --

26:22.710 --> 26:24.000
I don't have a choice.

26:25.580 --> 26:26.830
If I don't show up,
then they will arrest me.

26:26.830 --> 26:28.750
No, I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

26:32.580 --> 26:33.750
Hey.

26:48.290 --> 26:51.170
Maybe
we turn ourselves in.

26:51.170 --> 26:53.460
If you lose it,
I'm gonna lose it worse.

26:53.460 --> 26:56.290
No. They're gonna kill us all
if we keep this up.

26:56.290 --> 26:58.460
I'll go to jail, fine,

26:58.460 --> 26:59.880
but only after I kill
whoever did this.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.710
Shh, quiet.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.330
I'm Dr. Michaels.
I was in the ER

27:04.330 --> 27:05.670
when the paramedics
brought her in.

27:05.670 --> 27:07.290
Just tell us
if she's dead.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.830
My strategy is to put
the conspiracy charge itself

27:15.830 --> 27:17.710
on trial.
You want to fight
a hypothetical

27:17.710 --> 27:19.080
on your final exam?

27:19.080 --> 27:20.420
Even if my client said
bad things

27:20.420 --> 27:21.880
about the Queen,
it's free speech.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.420
It doesn't mean she joined
a conspiracy.

27:23.420 --> 27:25.210
The state's witness says
it was Snow White's idea

27:25.210 --> 27:26.500
for them
to kill the Queen.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.580
So what?
Every kindergartner is taught

27:28.580 --> 27:31.210
not to jump off the bridge
just 'cause someone says to.

27:31.210 --> 27:33.380
And the Dwarfs aren't children,
they're adults.

27:33.380 --> 27:34.670
They have free will.

27:34.670 --> 27:36.790
They chose to do this,
not my client.

27:36.790 --> 27:39.460
Charles Manson was convicted
of conspiracy to murder

27:39.460 --> 27:40.830
even though the state
couldn't prove

27:40.830 --> 27:42.500
that he ordered
the slayings.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.000
Manson already had
a record.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.540
Ms. White's record
is unblemished.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.670
She shouldn't take the fall
for the Dwarfs' crime.

27:48.670 --> 27:50.500
They have blood
on their hands.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.250
They should pay
the price.

27:56.290 --> 27:58.000
Hey.
Where the hell have you been?

27:59.290 --> 28:00.920
I went for a run.
No, I mean,

28:00.920 --> 28:02.540
why didn't you tell me
where you were going?

28:02.540 --> 28:04.460
What's going on?

28:04.460 --> 28:06.880
Look, I love you,
and things are insane again,

28:06.880 --> 28:11.000
so you can't just disappear
without telling me.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.330
Sorry.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.170
You know,
if we're being honest,

28:15.170 --> 28:16.290
I didn't tell you
where I was going

28:16.290 --> 28:18.670
because I'm kind of
annoyed...at you.

28:18.670 --> 28:21.210
I mean, this whole
"look how amazing and great

28:21.210 --> 28:25.460
you all were three years ago"
thing...

28:25.460 --> 28:28.540
You're overcompensating.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.210
For what?

28:30.210 --> 28:32.080
Me telling you about the night
with Sam.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.920
And I get it. You don't want
to see me like that.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.040
But --
I don't think that's right.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.580
It's a lot to take in,
Oli.

28:37.580 --> 28:39.170
I'd be doing
the same thing.

28:39.170 --> 28:41.750
Our first night together,
you seduced me to hack someone.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.620
I've never thought
you were a Pollyanna.

28:43.620 --> 28:46.330
But to know
that that's in me?

28:46.330 --> 28:47.960
I mean,
maybe my dad was right.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.330
No, your dad
doesn't know you.

28:49.330 --> 28:50.750
I do.

28:50.750 --> 28:53.120
And we all have darkness
in us.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.670
But you have good parts
in you, too.

28:56.670 --> 28:58.040
Just to hide the bad parts.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.460
Well, so?
It's better than not hiding it.

29:00.460 --> 29:02.080
And, yeah, I brought out
that essay

29:02.080 --> 29:08.080
because I'm proud to be married
to the guy that wrote that.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.960
And, yeah,
maybe I'm naive,

29:10.960 --> 29:13.580
but I still think

29:13.580 --> 29:17.380
that you can be the gay hero
that we never had.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.540
I don't.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.500
Well, then, I guess
we'll agree to disagree.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.040
No, I mean, I don't want
to be anyone's hero.

29:25.420 --> 29:30.830
I just want to be safe
and boring and happy.

29:33.210 --> 29:35.670
You're not happy?

29:35.670 --> 29:37.460
Are you?

29:53.250 --> 29:55.460
Dr. Michaels: It's called
a subperiosteal hematoma,

29:55.460 --> 29:57.960
basically a bone bruise
on your skull.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.710
Luckily, the airbag
helped diminish the injury,

29:59.710 --> 30:02.330
but we need to keep you here
for observation overnight.

30:02.330 --> 30:03.750
Watch for hemorrhaging,
clotting...

30:03.750 --> 30:05.170
But she's gonna be okay?

30:05.170 --> 30:06.580
That's why
we want her here.

30:06.580 --> 30:08.920
To make sure she doesn't
lose consciousness again.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.080
Do you understand?

30:11.290 --> 30:13.420
She needs rest.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.830
We'll be right here.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.670
I love you, Bon.

30:24.670 --> 30:26.830
You hear me?

30:26.830 --> 30:30.210
You're my whole damn life.

30:30.210 --> 30:31.710
I love you.

30:44.540 --> 30:45.790
Nate: Hey.

30:46.830 --> 30:48.040
How is she?

30:48.040 --> 30:49.830
She's gonna be okay.

30:49.830 --> 30:51.040
We don't know that.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.330
You feel good about this?

30:55.330 --> 30:56.290
Frank.

30:56.290 --> 30:57.960
She might die
'cause of you.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.000
You said Bonnie's okay?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.170
You got your justice
already.

31:00.170 --> 31:02.040
I didn't get nothing.
Miller's dead.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.290
How is that nothing?
He's dead,

31:03.290 --> 31:04.620
and Bonnie's the one
suffering for it.

31:04.620 --> 31:07.120
Annalise: Enough, Frank!

31:07.120 --> 31:10.920
You don't get to hurt her
anymore.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.290
Frank, stop.

31:12.290 --> 31:13.580
Let's go.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.500
What?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.290
Did you get to Gladden?

31:29.290 --> 31:30.380
No.
You called before I could.

31:30.380 --> 31:33.330
Good. Because there's
another way to fix this.

31:33.330 --> 31:35.170
I beat Xavier to death
or the Governor?

31:35.170 --> 31:36.750
Shut up. Listen.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.460
You were right, Frank.

31:38.460 --> 31:39.500
You were right.

31:45.580 --> 31:46.830
I can't do it.

31:46.830 --> 31:47.880
You don't have a choice.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.670
Xavier will kill me.

31:49.670 --> 31:51.920
I'll kill you first.

31:51.920 --> 31:56.080
And your son,
husband...

31:56.080 --> 31:57.790
whoever you love.

32:05.210 --> 32:07.250
Tegan: Officer Gladden,
at the inquest

32:07.250 --> 32:08.920
for Nathaniel Lahey Senior's
murder,

32:08.920 --> 32:10.290
you testified that

32:10.290 --> 32:12.790
Mr. Lahey stabbed you
with a pencil

32:12.790 --> 32:14.670
and attempted
to grab your gun.

32:14.670 --> 32:15.710
Correct?

32:15.710 --> 32:17.290
Gladden: Yes.

32:17.290 --> 32:21.380
And that's why your partner,
C.O. Wagner, shot Mr. Lahey.

32:21.380 --> 32:23.580
You called it
an act of self-defense?

32:23.580 --> 32:24.790
Yes.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.960
Were you ordered to lie
at that inquest?

32:30.790 --> 32:32.120
I'll rephrase.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.960
Did any person
or superior of yours

32:34.960 --> 32:36.620
order you
and Officer Wagner

32:36.620 --> 32:38.460
to shoot Mr. Lahey
that night?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.750
I...was just doing my job.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.540
Okay.
Let's be absolutely clear.

32:46.540 --> 32:48.750
Was your job that night
to murder an innocent man?

32:48.750 --> 32:50.170
Objection,
leading the witness.

32:50.170 --> 32:52.080
Sustained.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.750
Officer Gladden, were you
or were you not

32:54.750 --> 32:57.960
ordered to make sure
Nathaniel Lahey died that night?

33:00.210 --> 33:02.080
Paula,
look at this man.

33:03.460 --> 33:06.540
His father was about to get
the mental health care

33:06.540 --> 33:08.920
he'd been denied
his whole life

33:08.920 --> 33:10.170
when he was shot
and killed.

33:10.170 --> 33:11.580
Counsel is testifying,
Your Honor!

33:11.580 --> 33:14.750
So who told you
to murder Nathaniel Senior?!

33:14.750 --> 33:16.750
D.A. Miller?!
Objection!
No bona fide basis!

33:16.750 --> 33:18.420
Unburden yourself
of this guilt

33:18.420 --> 33:19.750
and tell us
who made you do this.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.830
I'm so sorry.
Judge, stop this!

33:21.830 --> 33:23.210
-Ms. Price, you are in contempt.
-Who ordered the hit?!

33:23.210 --> 33:25.750
Tell us finally who ordered you
to kill that man!

33:25.750 --> 33:27.290
Okay!

33:29.750 --> 33:31.500
Okay...

33:36.960 --> 33:39.120
Xavier Castillo.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.420
You were right, Frank.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.460
We need to tell them
the truth.
No.

33:46.460 --> 33:48.380
What's more important
to you?

33:48.380 --> 33:50.540
To put Xavier away
or to protect a lie?

33:50.540 --> 33:51.790
Bonnie will hurt herself
again.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.500
She's stronger now, Frank.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.210
We need to tell them
the truth.

33:56.210 --> 33:59.040
That's loving Bonnie.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.880
Tegan: Did Xavier Castillo
use anyone else

34:00.880 --> 34:02.670
to communicate with you?

34:02.670 --> 34:04.000
No.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.380
But isn't it true
D.A. Ronald Miller

34:06.380 --> 34:09.420
arranged for Mr. Lahey's
transfer that night?

34:09.420 --> 34:12.830
D.A. Miller tried to move
the transfer earlier to stop us.

34:12.830 --> 34:15.000
Xavier found out
and changed the plan.

34:16.830 --> 34:18.330
Xavier will kill me.

34:18.330 --> 34:20.420
I'll kill you first.

34:20.420 --> 34:23.330
And your son,
husband...

34:23.330 --> 34:25.330
whoever you love.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.120
Or you can tell
the truth.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.790
We were pressured
to do this...

34:29.790 --> 34:33.290
But it was my choice.

34:33.290 --> 34:37.380
I helped kill
an innocent man.

34:37.380 --> 34:41.170
There are no words to say
how sorry I am.

34:41.170 --> 34:43.710
What I did, it...

34:43.710 --> 34:45.880
it's evil.

34:47.540 --> 34:50.000
I deserve whatever punishment
you want to give me.

35:09.330 --> 35:11.620
Oliver: Okay, you can come down,
but keep your eyes closed!

35:11.620 --> 35:12.620
-Oliver.
-We're wasting time.

35:12.620 --> 35:13.790
This better be good.

35:13.790 --> 35:15.960
It's gonna be worth the wait,
I promise.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.250
Okay, now open your eyes!

35:20.080 --> 35:22.580
Puppies!

35:24.210 --> 35:25.960
Why?
Well, you needed
a study break.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.040
What's a better study break
than a puppy party?

35:28.040 --> 35:29.040
See,
you can't think of one.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.080

Since Officer Gladden
is a state employee

35:57.170 --> 35:59.170
who has admitted her involvement
in your father's death --

35:59.170 --> 36:01.830
Murder.

36:01.830 --> 36:04.710
I've been authorized to award
compensation for damages.

36:04.710 --> 36:06.290
How much?

36:18.210 --> 36:20.500
$10 million is the most
we've ever awarded a plaintiff

36:20.500 --> 36:22.460
in a wrongful death suit,
Mr. Lahey.

36:22.460 --> 36:23.540
Stipulations?

36:23.540 --> 36:24.920
Boiler plate.

36:24.920 --> 36:27.080
But the headline is you waive
all future claims

36:27.080 --> 36:28.750
to sue anyone involved
in this case.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.120
Of course.
We need time to discuss.

36:41.330 --> 36:43.670
The FBI is probably arresting
Xavier right now.

36:43.670 --> 36:44.500
What about the Governor?

36:44.500 --> 36:45.960
Xavier will turn on her.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.460
'Cause he'll make a deal,
get less time?

36:48.460 --> 36:49.830
Hell no.

36:49.830 --> 36:51.380
What are my options?

36:51.380 --> 36:53.790
We ask for a continuance
to pause the trial

36:53.790 --> 36:56.920
and take the time to investigate
the Governor's involvement.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.790
Do that.
That will also give
the Governor

36:58.790 --> 37:01.790
more time to doctor evidence,
make it go missing.

37:01.790 --> 37:04.710
And even if you win then,
there will be endless appeals.

37:04.710 --> 37:06.380
You might not see a cent
until you're an old man.

37:06.380 --> 37:07.710
I don't care
about the money.

37:07.710 --> 37:09.040
Do you care
about going to jail?

37:11.750 --> 37:13.830
Hypothetically,

37:13.830 --> 37:16.330
if you were involved
in any criminal activity

37:16.330 --> 37:19.880
related
to your father's murder...

37:19.880 --> 37:22.830
or D.A. Miller's...

37:22.830 --> 37:25.750
that, too, could come out
if we continue the suit.

37:30.080 --> 37:34.460
This doesn't end
until we bury Birkhead.

37:36.330 --> 37:39.790
on the wrongful death suit
of Nathaniel Lahey Senior.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.500
Prison guard Paula Gladden
took the stand

37:42.500 --> 37:44.330
and confessed
that she and her partner

37:44.330 --> 37:46.210
were ordered to murder
Mr. Lahey

37:46.210 --> 37:48.790
by Xavier Castillo.

37:48.790 --> 37:51.580
Gladden alleged that
deceased D.A. Ronald Miller

37:51.580 --> 37:53.620
tried to stop the shooting
from happening

37:53.620 --> 37:56.000

News Anchor: There's been

38:33.420 --> 38:35.670
are seeking to arrest
Mr. Castillo,

38:35.670 --> 38:38.920
whose father, Jorge,
is in federal prison.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.670
Sources tell us investigators
have no evidence

38:41.670 --> 38:44.040
of a connection
between the Castillo family

38:44.040 --> 38:45.710
and Governor Birkhead.

38:45.710 --> 38:47.330
Governor Birkhead:
I'm as surprised as anyone

38:47.330 --> 38:49.920
that Xavier Castillo
is involved in this case.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.040
But as I've said all along,

38:52.040 --> 38:54.250
it's my belief
that Emmett Crawford

38:54.250 --> 38:56.210
was at the heart
of this conspiracy

38:56.210 --> 38:58.920
to kill
Nathaniel Lahey Senior.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.120
Today's events
have not changed my mind.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.710
As a partner at Caplan & Gold,

39:03.710 --> 39:06.420
Mr. Crawford had both
legal and personal ties

39:06.420 --> 39:08.380
to the Castillo family...

39:08.380 --> 39:10.040
Annalise: You've reached the
voicemail of Annalise Keating.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.120
Please leave a message.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.420
Hey.

39:13.420 --> 39:15.620
I know you said
they wouldn't win,

39:15.620 --> 39:19.000
but I got a feeling you had
something to do with this.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
So, congratulations.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.880
Governor Birkhead:
My sympathy for the junior
Mr. Lahey notwithstanding,

39:25.880 --> 39:28.250
his insistence
on my involvement

39:28.250 --> 39:31.830
is and always has been
complete fiction.

39:31.830 --> 39:34.830
I thereby accept
today's turn of events

39:34.830 --> 39:36.960
as a total exoneration.

39:36.960 --> 39:40.290
I expect the FBI will be
releasing a statement

39:40.290 --> 39:42.500
saying as much very soon.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.620
Annalise: I still think
she's guilty.

39:44.620 --> 39:47.080
Even after every single one
of your defenses.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.580
So if I was on the jury,

39:48.580 --> 39:50.920
I would have no choice
but to convict Ms. White.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.500
There are at least 20 convincing
defenses on that board.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.210
Not according to me.
So you're gonna fail
all of us?

39:55.210 --> 39:56.750
I didn't say that,
but I definitely don't think

39:56.750 --> 39:58.580
that anyone earned this.

39:58.580 --> 40:00.540
Maybe I should just keep
this check for myself.

40:00.540 --> 40:02.040
Well, that was never mentioned
as an option.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.540
Well, I didn't think
I would be the only one

40:03.540 --> 40:07.790
to figure out this twist
in this case.

40:07.790 --> 40:10.460
After all these years,
you think that I wouldn't

40:10.460 --> 40:13.580
have a trick up my sleeve
for your final exam?

40:13.580 --> 40:15.170
Think.

40:15.170 --> 40:17.460
Who can tell me
what you all missed?

40:19.170 --> 40:21.580
Fine. Hint.
The Queen did it.

40:21.580 --> 40:24.170
The Queen killed herself?
T-There's no evidence of that.

40:24.170 --> 40:25.080
I didn't say
she killed herself.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.750
But she's the victim.

40:26.750 --> 40:27.540
Dead.

40:27.540 --> 40:29.170
Is she?

40:29.170 --> 40:30.790
Asher: O-M-G.

40:30.790 --> 40:33.120
There's no body!
Explain.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.830
The case study, uh,
it says the Dwarfs

40:34.830 --> 40:35.960
pushed the Queen
off the cliff.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.580
But not that anyone
ever found a body.

40:37.580 --> 40:38.710
Meaning?

40:38.710 --> 40:41.460
She faked her death
and framed Snow White.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.210
And that's the best defense
I've heard all day.

40:43.210 --> 40:44.750
Mr. Millstone,
come and get your check.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.620
Yeah!

41:13.580 --> 41:14.960
Man:
VIP Results. Good evening.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.290
Hi.

41:16.290 --> 41:18.750
Would you like to begin
the process?

41:18.750 --> 41:21.290
Yes. I'm ready.

41:21.290 --> 41:24.040
Okay, let's start
with deleting your hard drive.

41:27.710 --> 41:29.290
Done. Now what?

41:29.290 --> 41:31.620
Collect your money, key card,
and passport.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.920
Got 'em.
Pack them and keep them close
to your person at all times.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.420
Finished.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.120
Use the back stairwell
and exit the building.

41:49.290 --> 41:50.880
A car will be waiting
for you.

41:55.670 --> 41:57.040
Get inside, and your driver
will take you

41:57.040 --> 41:59.080
to a pre-arranged location.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.670
Once you arrive,
we'll call you

42:04.670 --> 42:06.380
with further instructions.
