00:01.523 --> 00:04.144
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant</i>

00:04.146 --> 00:06.007
<i>named Vandal Savage
conquered the world</i>

00:06.009 --> 00:07.942
<i>and murdered my wife and child.</i>

00:07.944 --> 00:10.631
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

00:10.633 --> 00:12.460
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

00:12.462 --> 00:14.737
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

00:14.739 --> 00:18.051
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance
to, the Time Masters.</i>

00:18.053 --> 00:20.281
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

00:20.283 --> 00:25.253
<i>but if we succeed, they will
be remembered as Legends.</i>

00:27.558 --> 00:29.624
<i>Previously on "Legends
of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:29.626 --> 00:32.127
Boys, ship's all yours.

00:32.128 --> 00:34.196
Mick!

00:34.198 --> 00:36.264
What are you gonna do, Snart?

00:36.266 --> 00:38.100
My husband and I get
along just fine on our own.

00:38.102 --> 00:39.601
We're still waiting on Sara

00:39.603 --> 00:41.536
and the two lovebirds to get back.

00:41.538 --> 00:45.040
Seems they've taken quite a shine to 1958.

00:48.245 --> 00:51.359
Sara swore her allegiance
to the League of Assassins.

00:51.361 --> 00:53.181
<i>It's time for her to return home.</i>

00:53.183 --> 00:55.383
My friend Thea calls it a bloodlust.

00:55.385 --> 00:57.619
Argh!

00:57.621 --> 00:59.755
- Sara, stop!
- I'm a monster.

01:01.425 --> 01:03.471
Not this guy again.

01:03.473 --> 01:05.749
<i>Captain, Chronos has
breached the starboard hatch.</i>

01:05.751 --> 01:06.397
How is that possible?

01:06.399 --> 01:08.775
Clearly he's received some new
toys from his Time Master friends

01:08.777 --> 01:10.465
since our last encounter.

01:11.835 --> 01:13.468
- _
- 1958's swell and all,

01:13.470 --> 01:16.037
but I miss the Internet...

01:16.039 --> 01:18.473
and cell phones.

01:18.475 --> 01:21.042
Gideon! Seal the bulkheads from here...

01:26.817 --> 01:27.949
Grey, come on! Let's do this!

01:27.951 --> 01:29.284
If we merge on the Waverider,

01:29.286 --> 01:30.886
it could destroy the entire ship!

01:30.888 --> 01:32.053
Um, are you not paying attention

01:32.055 --> 01:33.221
to what Chronos is doing?

01:33.223 --> 01:34.556
Fall back!

01:34.558 --> 01:36.091
Get to the Jumpship!

01:39.163 --> 01:40.896
Hey, come on!

01:40.898 --> 01:42.130
You sure it was a good idea

01:42.132 --> 01:43.598
leaving the Terminator on the bridge?

01:43.600 --> 01:44.900
Gideon has lockdown protocols which...

01:44.902 --> 01:46.701
<i>Have been overridden, Captain.</i>

01:46.703 --> 01:49.337
<i>Chronos is utilizing superior
Time Master technology.</i>

01:49.339 --> 01:51.740
<i>I cannot countermand his orders.</i>

01:52.776 --> 01:54.810
Uh...

01:54.812 --> 01:56.578
what are they doing?

01:56.580 --> 01:57.779
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:02.319 --> 02:04.953
Where did they go?

02:04.955 --> 02:06.388
Better question:

02:06.390 --> 02:08.523
why did they leave us?

02:11.595 --> 02:12.861
He's timejumping the ship.

02:12.863 --> 02:14.529
The ladies will be left in 1958.

02:14.531 --> 02:17.098
- What about Ray?
- Like I said.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.768
Let's go! We have to stop him!

02:21.638 --> 02:23.705
Argh!

02:23.707 --> 02:24.873
Oh!

02:24.875 --> 02:26.675
Gideon, open the doors on my mark.

02:26.677 --> 02:28.710
Get to the Jumpship and escape.

02:28.712 --> 02:30.512
We are not abandoning you.

02:30.514 --> 02:33.582
No, you are obeying a direct
order from your captain.

02:37.221 --> 02:38.687
Now, Gideon.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.397 --> 02:48.930
I don't know if the Jumpship will even fly

02:48.932 --> 02:50.665
from the Temporal Zone.

02:55.572 --> 02:57.239
It doesn't matter.

02:57.241 --> 02:59.107
- We're not leaving our team.
- What happened to:

02:59.109 --> 03:00.742
"We could destroy the whole ship"?

03:00.744 --> 03:03.111
A preferable alternative
to losing our friends.

03:03.113 --> 03:06.114
Don't you agree?

03:06.116 --> 03:08.283
Yeah.

03:11.021 --> 03:12.520
<i>We could've just opened
the door, Jefferson.</i>

03:12.522 --> 03:14.923
Sorry, I got a little carried...

03:14.925 --> 03:17.125
away.

03:24.935 --> 03:26.101
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

03:26.103 --> 03:28.970
Oh, God. Where's Chronos?

03:28.972 --> 03:31.473
<i>He absconded with Mr.
Snart on the Jumpship.</i>

03:31.475 --> 03:32.674
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

03:32.676 --> 03:34.175
Why would Chronos take Snart?

03:34.177 --> 03:35.510
Gideon, can you track them?

03:35.512 --> 03:37.712
<i>We have a more pressing matter.</i>

03:40.384 --> 03:41.650
Strap yourselves in.

03:45.322 --> 03:46.755
What's going on?

03:46.757 --> 03:48.823
Chronos has sabotaged
the navigation system.

03:48.825 --> 03:50.926
Unless we can find a
way to alter the course,

03:50.928 --> 03:52.160
we'll be trapped in the Temporal Zone

03:52.162 --> 03:53.194
for all time.

03:53.196 --> 03:54.696
Gideon...

03:54.698 --> 03:56.464
<i>I cannot override Chronos' commands.</i>

04:01.538 --> 04:02.537
What did you do?

04:02.539 --> 04:06.041
Rebooted Gideon.

04:06.043 --> 04:07.909
Until she's fully operational,

04:07.911 --> 04:09.678
we're free-falling through time.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.460
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

04:34.638 --> 04:36.571
We just have to stay calm.

04:36.573 --> 04:39.174
Wherever they timejumped... whenever...

04:39.176 --> 04:41.910
they'll come back to
this exact same moment.

04:48.967 --> 04:52.053
_

04:52.055 --> 04:53.888
They're not coming back.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.290
Let's go.

04:55.292 --> 04:57.092
Look, as a former Eagle Scout

04:57.094 --> 04:58.560
with over 100 merit badges...

04:58.562 --> 05:00.261
no big deal...

05:00.263 --> 05:02.464
the first rule of getting
lost is stay the same place.

05:02.466 --> 05:04.032
That way, you can be found.

05:04.034 --> 05:06.134
And as a former member of
the League of Assassins,

05:06.136 --> 05:07.702
the first rule when you've been attacked

05:07.704 --> 05:09.504
is to keep moving.

05:09.506 --> 05:12.941
I sort of think League wisdom
trumps the Eagle Scouts here.

05:12.943 --> 05:15.810
Plus, Savage is still out there.

05:15.812 --> 05:17.212
Guys, the rest of the team

05:17.214 --> 05:19.147
would not leave us marooned in 1958.

05:19.149 --> 05:21.916
Except for, that's exactly what they did.

05:21.918 --> 05:23.885
You said it yourself...
you have a time machine,

05:23.887 --> 05:26.454
and you're never late.

05:27.657 --> 05:29.991
They're not coming back.

05:36.166 --> 05:40.535
- _
- One good thing about 1958: no car alarms.

05:40.537 --> 05:42.504
I didn't think they had
cars in Nanda Parbat.

05:42.506 --> 05:45.273
Dated a lot of delinquents as a teenager.

05:47.711 --> 05:49.677
And now we're the delinquents.

05:49.679 --> 05:51.246
If we leave Harmony Falls,

05:51.248 --> 05:52.747
how's the rest of the team gonna find us?

05:52.749 --> 05:54.449
We don't know if they're looking for us.

05:54.451 --> 05:57.452
But we know Savage is. We can't take him.

05:57.454 --> 05:58.953
That means we can't stay here.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.757
Let's go.

06:11.918 --> 06:14.415
_

06:15.383 --> 06:19.007
_

06:19.876 --> 06:23.211
Oh, what did you do to our apartment?

06:23.213 --> 06:24.779
I'm creating a time beacon...

06:24.781 --> 06:26.314
a transponder which matches

06:26.316 --> 06:28.450
the Waverider's quantum signature,

06:28.452 --> 06:30.518
basically creating a radio wave firewall

06:30.520 --> 06:32.487
that only our team can see.

06:32.489 --> 06:34.556
It's cute that you think either of us

06:34.558 --> 06:36.958
understood a word of that.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.594
But I hope it works.

06:39.596 --> 06:41.129
In the meantime,

06:41.131 --> 06:43.865
maybe we should invest in some real beds.

06:49.573 --> 06:52.119
_

07:01.017 --> 07:02.283
Congratulations.

07:02.285 --> 07:04.919
You are a doctor.

07:04.921 --> 07:07.188
You know, I thought about
going to medical school once.

07:07.190 --> 07:09.691
Here you go. $10,000 salary.

07:09.693 --> 07:12.026
That's it? I made more as a barista.

07:12.028 --> 07:13.328
Well, it's 1958.

07:13.330 --> 07:14.462
You're lucky to make that as a woman.

07:14.464 --> 07:16.598
TouchÃ©. Your turn.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.033
I miss Netflix.

07:19.035 --> 07:20.969
Aha!

07:20.971 --> 07:23.104
The time beacon radio
is officially complete.

07:23.106 --> 07:25.140
- Well, great.
- Okay, here we go.

07:25.142 --> 07:26.741
Come on.

07:26.743 --> 07:29.811
Here we go.

07:29.813 --> 07:31.146
Hope there's a spot on that game

07:31.148 --> 07:32.680
that says "Return to the Waverider,"

07:32.682 --> 07:35.283
because that's what's about to happen.

07:35.285 --> 07:36.985
Here we go.

07:42.392 --> 07:44.225
I just have to fix a few of the kinks.

07:44.227 --> 07:46.594
The next version will
be much less explosive.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.296
Next version?

07:48.298 --> 07:50.064
I thought you said you were
gonna say something to him.

07:50.066 --> 07:51.566
Say what?

07:51.568 --> 07:53.735
That your beacon... it's a waste of time.

07:53.737 --> 07:56.037
They're not coming back, Ray.

07:56.039 --> 07:58.306
And it's not because
the Waverider is broken,

07:58.308 --> 08:00.074
or they're lost, or they can't find us,

08:00.076 --> 08:01.242
or whatever.

08:01.244 --> 08:02.644
It's because they're dead.

08:02.646 --> 08:04.345
And the sooner that you accept that,

08:04.347 --> 08:06.247
the sooner you can move on...

08:06.249 --> 08:08.783
the sooner we can all move on.

08:08.785 --> 08:10.451
So what? We're just supposed to give up?

08:10.453 --> 08:12.987
On being rescued, yeah.

08:17.594 --> 08:21.062
- Sara, what are you doing?
- I can't stay here.

08:21.064 --> 08:22.997
I need to find somewhere I belong.

08:22.999 --> 08:25.166
Sara, wait. You can't go.

08:25.168 --> 08:26.668
Savage is still out there.

08:26.670 --> 08:29.771
Don't draw undue attention on yourselves.

08:29.773 --> 08:32.039
Sara.

08:32.042 --> 08:33.674
Look, you two have each other.

08:33.677 --> 08:35.143
Most people,

08:35.145 --> 08:36.510
in any time period,

08:36.513 --> 08:39.780
aren't that lucky.

08:39.783 --> 08:42.850
Take care.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.690
- _
- Which gives us mesoscopic polymer

08:48.692 --> 08:51.359
and biomolecular simulations.

08:51.361 --> 08:52.594
Yes, Mr. Gates?

08:52.596 --> 08:53.828
If that's true,

08:53.830 --> 08:55.430
and you can soften matter,

08:55.432 --> 08:56.831
then doesn't that mean

08:56.833 --> 08:59.968
you could theoretically
miniaturize an atom?

08:59.970 --> 09:01.736
In theory, yes.

09:01.738 --> 09:03.171
But trust me,

09:03.173 --> 09:04.806
you don't want to try it at home.

09:04.808 --> 09:08.643
And definitely not for at
least another, mm, 40 years.

09:08.645 --> 09:10.111
Uh, aren't you supposed to be at home?

09:10.113 --> 09:11.646
I thought you said your son was sick.

09:11.648 --> 09:12.814
Yes, William.

09:12.816 --> 09:14.449
My in-laws are at my house,

09:14.451 --> 09:16.985
so if you don't mind,
I'd rather be in here.

09:17.988 --> 09:20.722
Your son is Bill Gates?

09:20.724 --> 09:22.123
Bill?

09:22.125 --> 09:24.492
That has a nice ring to it.

09:27.297 --> 09:28.863
Midterms are next week.

09:28.865 --> 09:30.832
Go ahead and pick up an
exam book on your way out.

09:30.834 --> 09:31.933
Class dismissed.

09:42.145 --> 09:45.213
- Happy second anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.353
I thought we said no gifts.

09:52.355 --> 09:53.755
I know.

09:53.757 --> 09:55.223
Just open it.

09:58.695 --> 10:00.161
Your time beacon?

10:00.163 --> 10:01.796
I thought we could destroy it together.

10:01.798 --> 10:03.431
You don't have to do that.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.833
I want to.

10:05.835 --> 10:08.703
You know, I never thought
that I could build a life

10:08.705 --> 10:11.572
with anybody but Anna.

10:11.574 --> 10:15.209
But, um, that's exactly what we've done,

10:15.211 --> 10:19.013
in the most unlikely
time and place imaginable.

10:19.015 --> 10:21.783
And I know it may sound strange,

10:21.785 --> 10:22.984
but I'm...

10:22.986 --> 10:26.220
glad that we were stranded here.

10:26.222 --> 10:27.455
Me too.

10:27.457 --> 10:28.623
I have one more surprise for you.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.091
Ray.

10:36.132 --> 10:38.499
- The beacon.
- _

10:38.501 --> 10:40.768
It's picking up a signal!

10:46.543 --> 10:49.544
Shiby-washo,
sara-so-so.

10:49.546 --> 10:51.746
You are suffering from
linguistic disorientation.

10:51.748 --> 10:54.282
It's a side effect of
such a severe time jump.

10:54.284 --> 10:55.917
- I can't hear anything.
- It'll pass.

10:55.919 --> 10:57.685
- What?
- Gideon, status update?

10:57.687 --> 11:00.288
<i>I am detecting a time beacon
signaling the Waverider.</i>

11:00.290 --> 11:02.323
<i>But then again, this is 1960.</i>

11:02.325 --> 11:03.691
1960?

11:03.693 --> 11:05.059
<i>The temporal navigation system</i>

11:05.061 --> 11:06.661
<i>was compromised and did its best</i>

11:06.663 --> 11:09.097
<i>to return us as close
as possible to 1958.</i>

11:09.099 --> 11:11.799
Salypso changa.

11:30.019 --> 11:31.853
Sorry we're late.

11:48.745 --> 11:52.614
Two years. You left us stranded in 1958.

11:52.616 --> 11:54.216
That was never my intention.

11:54.218 --> 11:57.018
Can't we rev the ship back up,

11:57.020 --> 11:59.253
go back to 1958, and
pick <i>that</i> us up?

11:59.255 --> 12:01.289
You know very well that we can't.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.157
Travel back to events we participated in

12:03.159 --> 12:04.960
without time folding in on itself.

12:04.962 --> 12:07.067
- Raymond.
- Good to see you.

12:07.069 --> 12:08.763
Good to see you. Glad you're back.

12:08.765 --> 12:10.031
Martin.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.435
It's just...

12:13.437 --> 12:15.056
I have 50 midterms to grade next week...

12:15.058 --> 12:16.238
by hand...

12:16.240 --> 12:17.639
and I've just come to terms

12:17.641 --> 12:19.974
with living in the technological dark ages.

12:19.976 --> 12:21.451
I have students who count on me.

12:21.453 --> 12:24.679
Kendra and I have friends and a life...

12:24.681 --> 12:26.915
Ray.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.251
This is what we've been waiting for.

12:29.253 --> 12:30.852
Remember the mission.

12:30.854 --> 12:35.590
We can finally be ourselves again.

12:37.394 --> 12:39.761
Look, I'm sorry. This is all...

12:39.763 --> 12:42.697
very intense.

12:42.699 --> 12:46.134
It's been two years for us.

12:46.136 --> 12:47.569
We thought you guys were dead.

12:47.571 --> 12:50.238
That very well might have been the case.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.506
Chronos attacked us.

12:51.508 --> 12:53.675
He sabotaged the ship and took Snart.

12:53.677 --> 12:55.877
We need to recover Ms. Lance as well.

12:55.879 --> 12:58.580
- Where is she?
- Uh, no idea.

12:58.582 --> 13:01.249
People go their separate
ways, lose track of each other.

13:01.251 --> 13:02.417
Gideon, search the timeline

13:02.419 --> 13:03.685
for any reference of a Sara Lance,

13:03.687 --> 13:06.087
or a blonde vigilante, circa 1960.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.155
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

13:07.157 --> 13:10.225
Why did Chronos take Snart?

13:10.227 --> 13:11.927
Couldn't he have taken you all in?

13:11.929 --> 13:13.495
You sound dubious.

13:13.497 --> 13:16.131
If Chronos was gonna settle
for taking one person,

13:16.133 --> 13:18.567
you'd think it would be you.

13:18.569 --> 13:21.937
He took Snart for a reason.

13:37.321 --> 13:38.753
Uh, hello?

13:38.755 --> 13:41.489
A UFO sighting in Hub City in 1960

13:41.491 --> 13:44.025
has created a time anomaly.

13:44.027 --> 13:46.428
It looks like your friends survived.

13:46.430 --> 13:49.898
And what would they be doing in 1960?

13:49.900 --> 13:52.334
That is out of the question, Mr. Palmer.

13:52.336 --> 13:54.336
What are we talking about?

13:54.338 --> 13:55.870
You changed.

13:55.872 --> 13:58.039
Yeah, I couldn't wait to get back in jeans.

13:58.041 --> 13:59.307
So what's going on?

13:59.309 --> 14:00.709
I have to go back to our apartment.

14:00.711 --> 14:02.143
Why?

14:02.145 --> 14:03.778
Because when we were unexpectedly picked up

14:03.780 --> 14:06.414
by a time ship, I was not
carrying the ATOM suit.

14:06.416 --> 14:07.949
And not for nothing, but we spent

14:07.951 --> 14:10.051
the last two years
together in that apartment.

14:10.053 --> 14:11.386
Is there anything you
want me to pick up for you?

14:11.388 --> 14:12.787
Your favorite coffee mug?

14:12.789 --> 14:14.322
Our lucky water vase?

14:14.324 --> 14:15.890
Lucky water vase?

14:15.892 --> 14:18.727
Yeah, it's a long but endearing story.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.097
Nothing?

14:22.099 --> 14:23.632
Don't you care about
anything that we left behind?

14:23.634 --> 14:26.001
Yes, but I don't think that I need

14:26.003 --> 14:28.903
to go back to the apartment
to get any of our old junk.

14:28.905 --> 14:31.806
Old junk? We lived there this morning.

14:31.808 --> 14:35.310
We certainly can't leave
Raymond's exo-suit back in 1960.

14:35.312 --> 14:37.212
I'll accompany you back to your apartment.

14:37.214 --> 14:39.214
We'll recover the future tech

14:39.216 --> 14:42.517
and any lucky ceramics.

14:44.921 --> 14:46.154
Ray...

14:46.156 --> 14:47.722
I'll get those blouses you like.

14:50.827 --> 14:54.663
Well, I hope that Sara takes
to being back on the team

14:54.665 --> 14:56.431
better than Ray seems to be taking it.

14:56.433 --> 15:00.168
Depends, I suppose, on
where exactly she ended up.

15:00.918 --> 15:02.904
_

15:18.021 --> 15:19.454
_

15:24.227 --> 15:25.827
<i>Ta-er
al-Sahfer.</i>

15:25.829 --> 15:28.563
I can see that the herbs
and meditation are working.

15:28.565 --> 15:31.466
Your thirst to kill no
longer clouds your judgment.

15:31.468 --> 15:32.867
Proceed.

15:38.442 --> 15:40.608
Stand up.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.243
I've enjoyed watching you train.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.713
I have never seen a
pupil advance so quickly.

15:44.715 --> 15:47.115
I've had time to learn who I am,

15:47.117 --> 15:48.817
and what it is I'm meant to do.

15:48.819 --> 15:51.953
We will watch this one closely, Talia.

15:51.955 --> 15:53.621
There is much you can learn from her.

15:57.894 --> 15:59.361
So, uh...

15:59.363 --> 16:02.397
what's so special about me?

16:02.399 --> 16:05.233
I mean, aside from my
sparkling personality.

16:05.235 --> 16:06.501
Back on the Waverider,

16:06.503 --> 16:08.103
you could've taken your boy, Rip.

16:08.105 --> 16:09.604
But you took me instead.

16:09.606 --> 16:11.272
Why?

16:11.274 --> 16:12.741
Hey, if you're gonna kill me,

16:12.743 --> 16:16.745
you could at least tell me what's going on.

16:16.747 --> 16:19.681
You should have figured it out by now.

16:28.558 --> 16:30.725
After all,

16:32.295 --> 16:35.330
I am supposed to be the dumb one.

16:43.304 --> 16:47.493
How?

16:47.495 --> 16:48.455
I think I deserve to know

16:48.457 --> 16:50.020
what the hell is going on here!

16:50.022 --> 16:51.262
You deserve nothing.

16:51.264 --> 16:53.990
Says the man who sold
us out to the pirates.

16:53.992 --> 16:55.509
When I dropped you off in that forest,

16:55.511 --> 16:57.860
I meant to kill you. That was the plan.

16:57.862 --> 16:59.328
You should've stuck with the plan

16:59.330 --> 17:01.697
and done me a favor.

17:01.699 --> 17:05.001
I wish there were some other way, Mick.

17:05.002 --> 17:06.536
You haven't got the guts.

17:06.538 --> 17:08.604
You want to kill me, kill me.

17:08.606 --> 17:11.174
Only one of us is
walking out of here alive.

17:11.175 --> 17:12.442
You're right.

17:14.982 --> 17:16.267
I knew you lacked the guts.

17:18.483 --> 17:20.715
I am sorry, Mick.

17:20.718 --> 17:23.152
I may not have trusted you
on the ship with the team,

17:23.154 --> 17:27.156
but I always, always
was coming back for you.

17:27.157 --> 17:29.692
Seems like one of us lost track of time.

17:29.694 --> 17:30.760
Well, how long did you...

17:30.762 --> 17:32.195
By the time they found me,

17:32.197 --> 17:35.064
I'd nearly lost my mind.

17:35.066 --> 17:36.532
I was so weak,

17:36.534 --> 17:39.569
I was strangling rats to survive.

17:39.571 --> 17:42.939
When who found you?

17:42.941 --> 17:44.707
The Time Masters.

17:48.046 --> 17:51.214
They took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

17:51.216 --> 17:53.583
Time doesn't exist there
the way it does on Earth.

17:53.585 --> 17:56.986
I've spent lifetimes
being restored by them,

17:56.988 --> 18:00.790
training by them, fighting by them...

18:00.792 --> 18:02.625
being reborn.

18:02.627 --> 18:05.394
And, uh, when exactly did your new friends

18:05.396 --> 18:08.030
give you the, uh, lobotomy?

18:11.436 --> 18:13.240
You think I was hunting
you and your friends

18:13.242 --> 18:15.638
because the Time Masters made me?

18:15.640 --> 18:18.341
They barely had to ask.

18:20.545 --> 18:24.614
Hey, uh, can we talk for a sec?

18:24.616 --> 18:26.115
Just... with everything that's going on,

18:26.117 --> 18:28.518
I don't know that this is the best time.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.853
You say that like there's
gonna be a better time.

18:32.624 --> 18:35.825
Okay.

18:35.827 --> 18:38.995
Look, we spent every night
the last two years together,

18:38.997 --> 18:40.997
playing board games, eating,

18:40.999 --> 18:42.231
deciding who was gonna cook

18:42.233 --> 18:43.533
and who was going to wash dishes,

18:43.535 --> 18:44.967
falling asleep to "The Ed Sullivan Show."

18:44.969 --> 18:46.769
But the second you saw the Waverider,

18:46.771 --> 18:48.638
it was like those two years never happened.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.806
Look, we were both trying to adapt

18:50.808 --> 18:54.076
to an impossible situation.

18:54.078 --> 18:55.645
But you are not a college professor,

18:55.647 --> 18:58.748
and I'm definitely not a librarian.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.350
So honestly, I'm just excited

19:01.352 --> 19:03.719
to be able to be myself again.

19:03.721 --> 19:05.354
I mean, aren't you even a little bit happy

19:05.356 --> 19:06.856
to be back on the ship?

19:06.858 --> 19:09.091
I was happy with the
life we built together,

19:09.093 --> 19:11.394
what I thought would be our future.

19:11.396 --> 19:14.430
And this just all feels
like moving backwards.

19:16.034 --> 19:18.634
Moving backwards.

19:18.636 --> 19:23.005
What if Sara didn't move
forwards with her life...

19:23.007 --> 19:24.740
she moved backwards?

19:24.742 --> 19:28.110
She said she wanted to go to
a place where she belonged.

19:28.112 --> 19:31.547
What's the one place in
1958 she already called home?

19:31.549 --> 19:33.316
The League of Assassins.

19:33.318 --> 19:34.850
There is one source that we could check

19:34.852 --> 19:35.842
to test your theory.

19:35.844 --> 19:37.973
Gideon, bring up the Shadow Record.

19:37.975 --> 19:38.867
Shadow Record?

19:38.869 --> 19:41.057
<i>The list of every member
of the League of Assassins</i>

19:41.059 --> 19:43.693
<i>since the invention of
writing in 3200 B.C.</i>

19:43.695 --> 19:45.861
Fascinating, except these sheets of papyrus

19:45.863 --> 19:47.463
are entirely blank.

19:47.465 --> 19:49.098
No, no, no. The League uses invisible ink.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.835
I did my graduate thesis at
the Academy on their history.

19:52.837 --> 19:53.936
Gideon.

19:53.938 --> 19:55.438
Sara said that Ra's al Ghul

19:55.440 --> 19:57.173
had lived nearly a
century before she met him.

19:57.175 --> 19:58.674
Thanks to the Lazarus Pit.

19:58.676 --> 20:01.510
It's basically a life-extending Jacuzzi,

20:01.512 --> 20:04.580
located in a place that's the
opposite of life-extending.

20:04.582 --> 20:06.849
You should count yourself
lucky, Dr. Palmer.

20:06.851 --> 20:08.317
Only a handful of outsiders

20:08.319 --> 20:09.952
have been inside the League's fortress

20:09.954 --> 20:11.687
and lived to tell the tale.

20:11.689 --> 20:13.189
<i>You are correct, Captain.</i>

20:13.191 --> 20:15.024
<i>There is a mention
of a Ta-er al-Sahfer.</i>

20:15.026 --> 20:16.993
That's Sara's League of Assassins name.

20:16.995 --> 20:19.829
According to the Shadow Record,
she joined the League in 1958.

20:19.831 --> 20:21.497
Incredible... Sara became a member

20:21.499 --> 20:22.798
of the secret organization

20:22.800 --> 20:24.834
that trained her to be an assassin

20:24.836 --> 20:27.436
50 years prior to when
she initially joined.

20:27.438 --> 20:29.071
Sara needs our help.

20:29.073 --> 20:30.506
By all accounts, Ra's al Ghul

20:30.508 --> 20:34.310
is a very controlling,
very homicidal fanatic.

20:34.312 --> 20:38.114
Gideon, chart a course for Nanda Parbat.

20:43.454 --> 20:45.588
Look, if you're gonna kill
me, just do it already.

20:45.590 --> 20:47.890
I'm not gonna kill you.

20:47.892 --> 20:50.593
I'm gonna take a trip back to Central City

20:50.595 --> 20:54.664
and visit your baby sister.

20:54.666 --> 20:56.632
The beautiful thing about time travel

20:56.634 --> 20:59.201
is I get to kill her more than once.

21:01.706 --> 21:03.706
I can kill Lisa in front of you,

21:03.708 --> 21:04.840
go back in time,

21:04.842 --> 21:06.475
kill her in front of you again

21:06.477 --> 21:08.411
and again and again.

21:08.413 --> 21:10.780
<i>Sir, several anomalies
in the timeline</i>

21:10.782 --> 21:13.516
<i>suggest that the Waverider has
touched down in Nanda Parbat.</i>

21:13.518 --> 21:16.052
Chart a course.

21:17.355 --> 21:18.921
I used to think the most beautiful thing

21:18.923 --> 21:20.956
on Earth was fire.

21:20.958 --> 21:22.491
Now I know

21:22.493 --> 21:24.126
it's vengeance.

21:34.639 --> 21:36.005
Perhaps Jefferson and I should...

21:36.007 --> 21:37.339
Extricating Sara from the likes

21:37.341 --> 21:38.674
of the League requires stealth.

21:38.676 --> 21:40.609
So no Firestorm for the two of you.

21:40.611 --> 21:42.845
And you're out of practice,

21:42.847 --> 21:46.682
so no ATOM suit unless
absolutely necessary.

21:46.684 --> 21:49.118
Look out!

21:51.756 --> 21:53.756
Thanks.

21:53.758 --> 21:55.291
Well done, Jefferson.

21:57.595 --> 21:59.895
You guard the exit while I find Sara.

21:59.897 --> 22:01.530
We will be in and out of here faster

22:01.532 --> 22:02.798
than you can say "Ra's al Ghul."

22:02.800 --> 22:04.867
Shh.

22:25.690 --> 22:29.225
Sara.

22:29.227 --> 22:30.993
It's me.

22:30.995 --> 22:32.194
Rip?

22:32.196 --> 22:33.829
I'm here to bring you back.

22:33.831 --> 22:36.132
I'm so sorry that it's taken me so long.

22:36.134 --> 22:37.767
- Who else is here?
- The entire team.

22:37.769 --> 22:39.101
Well, except for Mr. Snart.

22:39.103 --> 22:40.870
I'll explain everything back on the...

22:43.841 --> 22:45.102
_

22:45.104 --> 22:47.025
_

23:01.297 --> 23:02.463
Something's wrong.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.031
They should have been back by now.

23:04.033 --> 23:06.100
Well, I think this counts
as absolutely necessary.

23:06.102 --> 23:07.668
I've got my exo-suit shrunk down,

23:07.670 --> 23:09.636
and I can miniaturize
and do some tiny sneaking.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.900
It's been two years since
you've used that suit.

23:11.902 --> 23:12.757
And that's after you scavenged it

23:12.759 --> 23:14.312
for parts for your time beacon.

23:14.314 --> 23:15.682
You don't even know if it works.

23:15.684 --> 23:17.670
Is now really the time for
your little marital spat?

23:17.672 --> 23:18.537
We're not married.

23:18.539 --> 23:21.215
Can we just keep it down, please?

23:36.031 --> 23:38.232
- Sara?
- Found her.

23:38.234 --> 23:41.402
_

23:41.404 --> 23:42.736
Oh... hey.

23:45.374 --> 23:46.540
Hey.

23:48.544 --> 23:50.444
_

23:54.250 --> 23:56.917
Sara, what the hell?

23:56.919 --> 23:58.986
You shouldn't have come here.

23:58.988 --> 24:01.855
Yeah, I'm starting to get that.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.924
We came here to rescue you.

24:03.926 --> 24:05.959
I don't need to be rescued.

24:05.961 --> 24:07.327
I've found peace here.

24:07.329 --> 24:09.096
Peace with the League of Assassins?

24:09.098 --> 24:11.532
That must be the first time that
sentence has ever been uttered.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.933
Oh, I can't believe I'm back here.

24:12.935 --> 24:14.701
If this is retribution of some kind

24:14.703 --> 24:16.470
for stranding you in 1958...

24:16.472 --> 24:19.973
It is the will of Ra's al Ghul.

24:19.975 --> 24:23.510
Trespassers are to be executed.

24:30.085 --> 24:31.819
We just need a little more
time to get through to her.

24:31.821 --> 24:33.587
Do Time Masters have a
different understanding

24:33.589 --> 24:34.988
of the word "executed"?

24:34.990 --> 24:36.623
No, no, no. It's called "time drift."

24:36.625 --> 24:38.926
When one spends too long
in an alien timeline,

24:38.928 --> 24:41.762
one loses ties with one's former self,

24:41.764 --> 24:43.096
former identity.

24:43.098 --> 24:44.131
Oh, my God.

24:44.133 --> 24:45.499
What?

24:45.501 --> 24:47.167
I didn't understand it before,

24:47.169 --> 24:50.771
but my powers... they went dormant.

24:50.773 --> 24:52.573
- What are you talking about?
- My wings.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.241
You must have noticed
that I haven't been able

24:54.243 --> 24:57.311
to "hawk out" in almost two years.

24:57.313 --> 25:00.881
I just thought that you didn't want to.

25:00.883 --> 25:02.149
Why didn't you tell me?

25:02.151 --> 25:03.884
Because it was so hard

25:03.886 --> 25:06.286
for you to give up hope
that the team would return.

25:06.288 --> 25:08.455
When you finally did, you
started to be happy again,

25:08.457 --> 25:12.059
and I couldn't bear
telling you that I wasn't.

25:12.061 --> 25:14.228
- That ain't good.
- I had no idea.

25:14.230 --> 25:15.963
Look, Ray,

25:15.965 --> 25:18.265
I loved being with you.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.067
I wasn't just losing my powers.

25:20.069 --> 25:23.337
I was losing my memories of my past lives.

25:23.339 --> 25:25.272
I was starting to lose myself.

25:25.274 --> 25:29.443
I'm sorry. I...

25:29.445 --> 25:32.446
But, look, you didn't have to protect me.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.413
I could have handled the truth.

25:33.415 --> 25:35.415
It couldn't have been so
easy for Raymond, either,

25:35.417 --> 25:37.918
having to give up being the ATOM.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.487
I'm sorry, can we have a private moment?

25:40.489 --> 25:42.956
I think we all wish you would've had

25:42.958 --> 25:45.192
this moment in private.

25:47.229 --> 25:49.062
Don't you think that we were meant

25:49.064 --> 25:52.099
for something greater
than being stuck in 1960,

25:52.101 --> 25:53.967
eating fondue with the neighbors?

25:53.969 --> 25:56.169
Yeah, we were meant to be
tortured and executed in

25:56.171 --> 25:57.671
Nanda "I can't believe
I'm back here" Parbat.

25:57.673 --> 26:00.507
<i>If</i> we die,

26:00.509 --> 26:04.411
at least it would be in
pursuit of a greater purpose.

26:04.413 --> 26:06.380
- That's it.
- What's it?

26:06.382 --> 26:08.315
Ra's al Ghul's purpose in
life is to see that the League

26:08.317 --> 26:10.651
continues with all of its
ancient traditions intact...

26:10.653 --> 26:12.686
Including murdering intruders?

26:12.688 --> 26:15.322
I will appeal to Ra's al Ghul's respect

26:15.324 --> 26:17.291
for the League's traditions,

26:17.293 --> 26:22.195
invoking one of them right now.

26:22.197 --> 26:23.864
Well, what kind of traditions, man?

26:23.866 --> 26:25.299
Guards!

26:27.536 --> 26:28.902
Guards!

26:33.342 --> 26:35.709
Would you mind loosening
these up a little bit

26:35.711 --> 26:37.811
before you leave?

26:39.615 --> 26:41.315
Just out of curiosity,

26:41.317 --> 26:43.517
what do you think your new
masters are gonna do with you

26:43.519 --> 26:46.353
once you've delivered the team up to them?

26:46.355 --> 26:48.488
I don't expect there's a pension plan

26:48.490 --> 26:51.391
for old bounty hunters.

26:51.393 --> 26:53.226
Once they get what they want from you,

26:53.228 --> 26:55.963
they're gonna toss you aside.

26:55.965 --> 26:57.698
Like you tossed me aside?

26:57.700 --> 26:59.866
You and I both made choices
that led us to this moment.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.636
What matters, Mick, is your next move.

27:02.638 --> 27:03.904
And I'm willing to bet

27:03.906 --> 27:06.406
that some little piece of the old you

27:06.408 --> 27:09.543
is in that armor somewhere.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.911
No.

27:10.913 --> 27:12.746
You're wrong.

27:15.117 --> 27:16.316
Mr. Hunter.

27:16.318 --> 27:19.119
Captain, as point of fact.

27:19.121 --> 27:20.621
Right.

27:20.623 --> 27:22.556
Well, I do hope your
request for an audience

27:22.558 --> 27:25.125
is not an attempt to
justify your trespass here.

27:25.127 --> 27:26.960
Most certainly not.

27:26.962 --> 27:29.296
But it would be remiss of me
if I didn't use this opportunity

27:29.298 --> 27:32.132
to reiterate that Sara

27:32.134 --> 27:35.002
is very important to me...

27:35.004 --> 27:36.470
to all of us.

27:36.472 --> 27:38.972
And as she is to me.

27:38.974 --> 27:42.943
And as you can all see, she
has chosen to remain here.

27:42.945 --> 27:45.345
Yes, well, if that is her wish,

27:45.347 --> 27:47.280
we will indeed honor it.

27:47.282 --> 27:48.915
Well, thank you.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.285
But your deaths will make
that concession irrelevant.

27:52.287 --> 27:54.321
Well, according to my
understanding of League Law,

27:54.323 --> 27:57.758
the whole death thing can be avoided,

27:57.760 --> 28:00.260
should we prevail at trial.

28:00.262 --> 28:03.930
Yeah, I don't think these guys
are the "People's Court" type.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.033
I demand a trial by combat.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.038
And how is a man such
as you so well-versed

28:11.040 --> 28:13.674
on our traditions?

28:13.676 --> 28:15.642
Do we have an accord?

28:21.083 --> 28:23.050
May victory be yours.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.155
I was under the impression
that I would be fighting you.

28:28.157 --> 28:30.390
Then it would seem your
understanding of our laws

28:30.392 --> 28:31.558
requires some refinement.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.926
You see,

28:32.928 --> 28:36.663
I may choose any champion I wish,

28:36.665 --> 28:38.799
as may you.

28:44.873 --> 28:46.640
I'll do it.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.975
You haven't had very much
experience in swordsmanship,

28:48.977 --> 28:50.577
Mr. Palmer.

28:52.748 --> 28:55.082
I nominate Ms. Saunders.

28:55.084 --> 28:57.184
What? No.

28:57.186 --> 28:58.418
Didn't you hear? She can't even hawk...

28:58.420 --> 29:01.054
I accept.

29:01.056 --> 29:02.956
- Kendra, you can't...
- I've got this.

29:53.175 --> 29:54.674
You have to put a stop to this.

29:54.676 --> 29:56.476
Sara taught Kendra to
control her warrior side.

29:56.478 --> 30:00.113
I believe that Kendra can
remind Sara of her humanity.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.951
Before or after Sara kills her?

30:04.953 --> 30:06.186
Sara.

30:06.188 --> 30:07.554
<i>Ta-er
al-Sahfer.</i>

30:07.556 --> 30:10.223
Whatever your name is now.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.259
I know you don't want to kill me.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.934
Argh!

30:20.936 --> 30:23.270
Want is irrelevant.

30:23.272 --> 30:26.306
I serve Ra's al Ghul.

30:52.968 --> 30:55.001
Remember that move?

30:55.003 --> 30:57.437
You taught it to me.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.140
Your teacher was excellent.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.418
Sara, no!

31:13.488 --> 31:15.021
Argh!

31:23.131 --> 31:25.632
Sara.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.567
You're not a murderer or an assassin.

31:27.569 --> 31:29.302
_

31:29.304 --> 31:30.470
No!

31:30.472 --> 31:31.638
You're the White Canary.

31:45.687 --> 31:47.187
I know that sound.

31:49.424 --> 31:50.891
Chronos.

32:03.174 --> 32:04.174
_

32:05.470 --> 32:07.240
_

32:14.144 --> 32:16.797
You can't face him; you can't defeat him.

32:16.799 --> 32:18.261
_

32:18.263 --> 32:20.470
_

32:20.644 --> 32:21.644
_

32:41.490 --> 32:44.239
You brought him here. It's
only right you kill him.

32:50.966 --> 32:52.799
It's a long story, pal.

32:56.505 --> 32:57.671
Ray!

33:56.098 --> 33:59.499
- You son of a bitch.
- Don't do it.

33:59.501 --> 34:02.002
- Don't kill him.
- Snart?

34:02.004 --> 34:04.171
Sorry, don't kill Chronos?

34:04.173 --> 34:07.707
He's not Chronos. Show them.

34:21.723 --> 34:23.523
My God.

34:23.525 --> 34:25.992
There is no God.

34:36.690 --> 34:37.958
I imagine you have some questions

34:37.960 --> 34:40.205
about what you witnessed.

34:40.206 --> 34:44.076
When the lady you call Sara
Lance first arrived here,

34:44.078 --> 34:46.043
her skills were unmatched.

34:46.045 --> 34:50.382
It was as if she had
completed the training before.

34:50.384 --> 34:54.253
I suppose that's because
you're both from the future.

34:54.255 --> 34:56.688
When I came to your doorstep,

34:56.690 --> 34:59.591
for the second time in my life,

34:59.593 --> 35:03.362
I thought that I could find a home here,

35:03.364 --> 35:05.464
that this is where I really belong.

35:05.466 --> 35:07.900
But your soul is divided

35:07.902 --> 35:09.568
by your ability to kill

35:09.570 --> 35:13.272
and your desire to show mercy.

35:13.274 --> 35:16.275
And there is no place for one so conflicted

35:16.277 --> 35:20.179
within the League.

35:20.181 --> 35:22.981
<i>Ta-er
al-Sahfer,</i>

35:22.983 --> 35:24.716
I release you.

35:26.153 --> 35:29.321
You can reclaim your previous name

35:29.323 --> 35:31.590
and your past life.

35:31.592 --> 35:33.992
Thank you.

35:41.669 --> 35:43.101
In October 2008,

35:43.103 --> 35:45.003
please see that your
daughter is off the coast

35:45.005 --> 35:46.805
of an island in the North China Sea...

35:46.807 --> 35:48.106
Lian Yu.

35:48.108 --> 35:50.609
Why would I send Talia on such a journey?

35:50.611 --> 35:53.412
Not Talia.

35:53.414 --> 35:55.280
Your daughter yet to be born.

35:55.282 --> 35:57.049
I'm pretty sure you'll call her Nyssa.

36:05.159 --> 36:06.925
You think this is all over?

36:06.927 --> 36:10.162
I will kill every single one of you.

36:10.164 --> 36:12.764
I will watch you all burn!

36:12.766 --> 36:14.233
You...

36:14.235 --> 36:16.115
you should have killed
me when you had the ch...

36:20.174 --> 36:22.374
You owe us an explanation.

36:22.376 --> 36:23.909
Yes, it's quite remarkable

36:23.911 --> 36:25.544
Mr. Rory is working

36:25.546 --> 36:28.313
for the Time Masters,
considering you killed him.

36:28.315 --> 36:31.650
If you think back, I never
actually said I killed him.

36:31.652 --> 36:33.518
No, you just let us think that you did.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.654
I didn't have to try too hard, did I?

36:35.656 --> 36:37.322
Well, maybe I should have.

36:37.324 --> 36:39.358
And at least he wouldn't
have would up a chew toy

36:39.360 --> 36:41.393
for the Time Masters.

36:41.395 --> 36:44.263
But if you did, we wouldn't
have this opportunity.

36:44.265 --> 36:47.199
An opportunity? To do what?

36:49.336 --> 36:53.238
To reform Mr. Rory.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.673
He killed Aldus.

36:54.675 --> 36:57.042
Under the influence of the Time Masters.

36:57.044 --> 36:59.678
Chronos killed Aldus.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.249
Mr. Rory was fighting on our side that day.

37:02.251 --> 37:05.884
I know what it's like to be
trained by an organization

37:05.886 --> 37:07.853
for one purpose, to kill,

37:07.855 --> 37:11.423
and the kind of loyalty
that it can inspire.

37:11.425 --> 37:14.259
I need to know that we can reach Rory.

37:14.261 --> 37:15.527
For my own sake.

37:15.529 --> 37:16.928
The Time Masters took one of our own

37:16.930 --> 37:19.431
and turned him against us.

37:19.433 --> 37:23.235
I say we undo their handiwork.

37:23.237 --> 37:26.505
Rory saved my life back in the gulag.

37:26.507 --> 37:28.907
He's more than just a
criminal and an arsonist.

37:28.909 --> 37:30.042
He's a member of our team.

37:30.044 --> 37:31.710
He's a lost cause.

37:31.712 --> 37:34.946
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

37:34.948 --> 37:38.817
You will see that miracles
abound on this old timeship.

37:40.521 --> 37:45.223
Gideon, start the regeneration process.

37:45.225 --> 37:47.592
What do you mean by "regeneration"?

37:47.594 --> 37:49.294
I took genetic samples from each of you

37:49.296 --> 37:52.030
at the start of our voyage
for this exact eventuality.

37:52.032 --> 37:55.233
Why am I only hearing about this now?

37:55.235 --> 37:56.902
Because none of you had lost a limb yet.

38:00.374 --> 38:02.941
Ow.

38:25.332 --> 38:27.799
So were you gonna tell me?

38:27.801 --> 38:29.334
Sorry, tell you what?

38:29.336 --> 38:32.938
That you were moving
into your room without me?

38:32.940 --> 38:34.339
Oh, um,

38:34.341 --> 38:40.278
I just assumed that you wanted some space.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.848
You made it pretty clear that
you were over our old life.

38:42.850 --> 38:46.184
Look...

38:46.186 --> 38:50.188
just because I wasn't
satisfied with the circumstances

38:50.190 --> 38:53.125
doesn't mean I didn't
fall in love with you.

38:57.931 --> 39:00.165
It's just, I...

39:00.167 --> 39:02.634
I don't want to lose you.

39:02.636 --> 39:05.370
And I don't want to lose you.

39:05.372 --> 39:07.739
For the first time

39:07.741 --> 39:10.876
in probably centuries,

39:10.878 --> 39:14.679
I actually got to decide who
I want to fall in love with,

39:14.681 --> 39:19.017
instead of having it decided for me.

39:19.019 --> 39:20.819
So it doesn't matter where

39:20.821 --> 39:23.889
or when we are.

39:23.891 --> 39:27.559
You're the person I want to be with.

39:30.297 --> 39:31.563
Wow.

39:31.565 --> 39:33.999
That was... was that, like, rehearsed?

39:34.001 --> 39:38.103
Because that was really good.

39:38.105 --> 39:41.339
So...

39:41.341 --> 39:42.874
what do you want?

40:08.035 --> 40:10.202
I believe we're ready to leave 1960.

40:10.204 --> 40:13.104
And go where? I mean, when?

40:13.106 --> 40:14.773
2147.

40:14.775 --> 40:17.808
Mere decades before Vandal
Savage conquered the world.

40:17.810 --> 40:20.645
I thought you had no idea where he was.

40:20.647 --> 40:23.248
You said Savage had been lost to history.

40:23.250 --> 40:25.450
Not world-changing history.

40:25.452 --> 40:27.018
Records of the period are scarce,

40:27.020 --> 40:28.854
but I've always known

40:28.856 --> 40:31.690
that Vandal Savage can be located in 2147.

40:31.692 --> 40:33.658
So why haven't you told us this sooner?

40:33.660 --> 40:36.194
Because that period of history
is fraught with more peril

40:36.196 --> 40:37.796
than I was willing to risk.

40:37.798 --> 40:39.498
We have no choice

40:39.500 --> 40:44.302
but to stop Vandal Savage in 2147...

40:44.304 --> 40:47.806
or to die trying.

40:47.808 --> 40:50.542
Well, I've died before.

40:50.544 --> 40:52.410
So have I.

40:56.517 --> 41:01.353
Gideon, plot a course
for Kasnia Conglomerate...

41:04.157 --> 41:06.758
The year 2147.
