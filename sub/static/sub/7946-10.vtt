15:20.334 --> 15:22.209
- Remember what he
- always used to say?

15:22.250 --> 15:23.709
ALL: "Put it in the trash,

15:23.710 --> 15:25.167
or I'll put it

15:22.250 --> 15:25.167
in your dinner."

15:27.083 --> 15:28.167
(SOBS) I really

15:28.168 --> 15:29.250
miss that guy.

15:29.292 --> 15:30.334
Hey!

15:30.375 --> 15:31.709
Is Roger here?

15:31.751 --> 15:33.268
- I don't want him to know
- I'm taking a study break.

15:33.292 --> 15:34.792
But if I don't, I'm gonna

15:34.793 --> 15:36.292
have a study-breakdown.

15:36.334 --> 15:37.397
Roger's cleaning the

15:37.398 --> 15:38.459
plants on the terrace.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.959
- He said,
- "They're dirty!"

15:41.876 --> 15:43.792
They're planted in dirt!

15:43.834 --> 15:44.877
And what's next?

15:44.878 --> 15:45.918
Mopping the floor

15:43.834 --> 15:45.918
of the fish tank?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.022
Jessie, can't we

15:48.023 --> 15:49.042
get Bertram back?

15:49.083 --> 15:51.042
Roger is totes annoying!

15:51.083 --> 15:52.230
I never thought I'd hate

15:52.231 --> 15:53.375
a man who could

15:51.083 --> 15:53.375
rock a cravat,

15:53.417 --> 15:55.000
but here we are.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.209
He alphabetized my

15:58.210 --> 15:59.417
practical jokes.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.771
He actually took the

16:00.772 --> 16:02.083
fun out of pranking!

16:02.125 --> 16:04.042
He's a monster!

16:04.083 --> 16:05.563
And he makes me

16:05.564 --> 16:07.042
go to bed at 8:30!

16:07.083 --> 16:08.334
8:30 is your bedtime.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.125
- I know!
- It's awful!

16:10.167 --> 16:12.000
- Now I stay awake
- all through school!

16:14.042 --> 16:15.042
Oh! (GROANS)

16:16.417 --> 16:18.209
Although I admire

16:18.210 --> 16:20.000
Roger's meticulous nature

16:20.042 --> 16:22.000
- and high
- academic standards,

16:22.042 --> 16:23.042
I must admit...

16:25.083 --> 16:27.000
- I am chafing
- something fierce.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.022
Look, guys,

16:30.023 --> 16:31.042
I miss Bertram too,

16:31.083 --> 16:32.542
- but there's
- nothing we can do.

16:32.584 --> 16:33.834
He's having the time

16:33.835 --> 16:35.083
of his life at his new job.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.292
How do you know?

16:36.334 --> 16:37.542
Don't ask.

16:37.584 --> 16:39.375
- I can't re-live
- that again.

16:39.417 --> 16:40.480
Just trust me,

16:40.481 --> 16:41.542
he's moved on.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.772
Besides, I know Roger is

16:42.773 --> 16:43.959
kind of a perfectionist,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.918
but he's not that bad.

16:45.959 --> 16:47.042
ROGER: Fraeulein Jessie,

16:47.083 --> 16:49.000
- you're not taking
- a break, are you?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.042
Hide me!

16:50.083 --> 16:51.083
Whoa!

16:53.500 --> 16:54.542
(SNIFFS)

16:54.584 --> 16:56.167
Who's been eating in here?

16:56.209 --> 16:57.542
I smell deviled eggs.

17:01.626 --> 17:03.042
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

17:09.166 --> 17:11.125
- Perfect. That's
- the whole stack.

17:11.626 --> 17:12.917
Danke.

17:12.959 --> 17:15.209
Where are you going?

17:15.250 --> 17:16.375
(MOCK GERMAN ACCENT)

17:16.376 --> 17:17.500
Away from these stinking

17:15.250 --> 17:17.500
flash-karten.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.021
Do you really want

17:20.022 --> 17:21.041
to quit now and do

17:19.000 --> 17:21.041
the minimum?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.834
Or, as I've heard this

17:22.835 --> 17:24.584
family say, "Luke it"?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.584
- But I was up
- all night studying!

17:26.626 --> 17:28.084
These bags under my

17:28.085 --> 17:29.542
eyes are so big they

17:26.626 --> 17:29.542
could carry groceries.

17:29.584 --> 17:30.772
The heavy stuff, like

17:30.773 --> 17:31.959
milk and detergent!

17:32.584 --> 17:34.542
Jessie, when I arrived,

17:34.584 --> 17:35.814
this family was

17:35.815 --> 17:37.042
languishing under

17:34.584 --> 17:37.042
the care of a butler

17:37.083 --> 17:38.188
who didn't know his

17:38.189 --> 17:39.292
crumb catcher from

17:37.083 --> 17:39.292
his cummerbund.

17:39.334 --> 17:41.417
Are you okay?

17:41.459 --> 17:43.643
- I haven't seen you this upset - since you
found that apple - Core in the couch cushions.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.959
It had fuzz on it!

17:45.000 --> 17:46.400
- I was just happy
- Luke ate fruit.

17:47.417 --> 17:49.167
It's unacceptable!

17:49.209 --> 17:51.083
- I must make
- everything perfect.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.584
And nothing is going

17:52.585 --> 17:54.042
to stand in my way.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.751
(YELLS) No!

17:55.792 --> 17:56.918
I had these sorted into

17:56.919 --> 17:58.042
masculine, feminine

17:55.792 --> 17:58.042
and neuter nouns!

17:58.083 --> 17:59.209
- (GASPS)
- Roger!

17:59.250 --> 18:00.375
Get a grip!

18:00.417 --> 18:01.417
Ow!

18:03.292 --> 18:04.355
Did you just give me

18:04.356 --> 18:05.417
a black and blue butler?

18:05.459 --> 18:07.417
- You left me
- no choice.

18:07.459 --> 18:08.730
Look, it's good

18:08.731 --> 18:10.000
to try your best,

18:10.042 --> 18:11.584
- but not at the
- expense of all fun,

18:11.626 --> 18:12.918
Sleep, and contact

18:12.919 --> 18:14.209
with upholstery.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.793
Nobody is perfect, Roger.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.334
Not even you.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.334
That's, that's...

18:19.375 --> 18:21.042
- That's so true!
- Oh!

18:21.083 --> 18:22.230
I just don't know any

18:22.231 --> 18:23.375
other way to live.

18:23.417 --> 18:24.480
My mother always

18:24.481 --> 18:25.542
demanded perfection

18:23.417 --> 18:25.542
from me.

18:25.584 --> 18:26.834
- Oh, I get it,
- my father...

18:26.876 --> 18:28.022
Do you know how

18:28.023 --> 18:29.167
hard it is to make

18:26.876 --> 18:29.167
friends in kindergarten

18:29.209 --> 18:30.602
- when you're wearing
- a three-piece suit?

18:30.626 --> 18:31.813
(BAWLING)

18:31.814 --> 18:33.000
Roger, okay...

18:35.542 --> 18:37.042
There, there.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.667
- Snot into my skirt
- all you want.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.059
- You're the one
- who does the laundry.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.292
(WAILING)

18:45.083 --> 18:46.563
Make sure that silver

18:46.564 --> 18:48.042
is good and

18:45.083 --> 18:48.042
polished, Bertie.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.000
- I want to be able
- to see you in it.

18:51.709 --> 18:53.042
- Okay? Is everybody
- decent?

18:53.083 --> 18:55.000
- Children entering
- the premises.

18:55.042 --> 18:56.042
(ALARM SOUNDING)

18:58.751 --> 19:00.667
What was that?

19:00.709 --> 19:01.980
The foyer is wired

19:01.981 --> 19:03.250
to go off whenever

19:00.709 --> 19:03.250
children enter.

19:03.292 --> 19:04.834
Unfortunately, the

19:04.835 --> 19:06.375
electrified floor doesn't

19:03.292 --> 19:06.375
seem to be working.

19:06.417 --> 19:07.459
What!

19:09.083 --> 19:10.667
- So, what are you
- all doing here?

19:10.709 --> 19:12.126
The kids have

19:12.127 --> 19:13.542
something to

19:10.709 --> 19:13.542
say to you.

19:13.584 --> 19:15.250
- Bertram, we want
- to apologize.

19:15.292 --> 19:16.855
Yeah, we never should

19:16.856 --> 19:18.417
have pulled that

19:15.292 --> 19:18.417
stupid prank.

19:18.459 --> 19:20.083
We are terribly sorry...

19:20.125 --> 19:21.376
Even though I am,

19:21.377 --> 19:22.626
as usual, blameless.

19:24.292 --> 19:25.709
Please come back.

19:25.751 --> 19:28.167
We really miss you.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.250
Tough toenails, tykes!

19:30.292 --> 19:32.168
You didn't appreciate

19:32.169 --> 19:34.042
Bertie when you had him,

19:30.292 --> 19:34.042
and now he's mine!

19:34.083 --> 19:35.542
He signed a contract.

19:35.584 --> 19:37.667
That wasn't a contract.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.376
You forced me to autograph

19:39.377 --> 19:41.042
a picture of myself for

19:37.709 --> 19:41.042
your nightstand.

19:41.083 --> 19:42.355
(CHUCKLES)

19:42.356 --> 19:43.626
Potato, pot-ah-to!

19:43.667 --> 19:45.459
It's binding!

19:46.792 --> 19:47.938
I'll tell you what's

19:47.939 --> 19:49.083
binding, these shorts!

19:51.709 --> 19:53.250
- And why do you
- want me back?

19:53.292 --> 19:54.292
Isn't Roger

19:54.293 --> 19:55.293
the perfect butler?

19:55.334 --> 19:57.042
- We don't want
- the perfect butler.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.167
We want you!

19:59.751 --> 20:01.168
We have seen what

20:01.169 --> 20:02.584
too much perfection

19:59.751 --> 20:02.584
can lead to,

20:02.626 --> 20:04.000
and it is not pretty.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.960
Seriously, I would show

20:07.961 --> 20:09.751
you the rash if I could

20:06.167 --> 20:09.751
get these pants off.

20:11.125 --> 20:12.417
(CHUCKLES)

20:12.459 --> 20:13.667
Bertram.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.022
Look, you may not be

20:15.023 --> 20:16.334
perfect, but...

20:17.083 --> 20:18.375
You're perfect for us.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.626
And we love you.

20:23.417 --> 20:25.667
Oh, I love you guys, too.

20:25.709 --> 20:27.125
(ALL SOBBING)

20:27.167 --> 20:28.209
Ugh!

20:28.626 --> 20:30.042
Okay.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.417
- Bertram's back!
- (CLAPPING)

20:31.792 --> 20:32.792
Wait!

20:33.584 --> 20:35.751
What about me?

20:35.792 --> 20:37.667
- You miscreants
- have each other,

20:37.709 --> 20:38.751
But now I'm all

20:38.752 --> 20:39.792
alone again.

20:39.834 --> 20:40.939
Where's Rhoda's

20:40.940 --> 20:42.042
happy ending?

20:42.083 --> 20:43.459
Jessie?

20:43.500 --> 20:44.522
Sorry to disturb.

20:44.523 --> 20:45.542
Ooh!

20:45.584 --> 20:46.584
Rhoda likey.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.083
Thank you for accepting

20:49.084 --> 20:50.084
my resignation.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.584
Auf Wiedersehen.

20:51.626 --> 20:52.792
Not so fast!

20:52.834 --> 20:54.564
Jezebel, who is this

20:54.565 --> 20:56.292
tasty piece of schnitzel?

20:58.083 --> 20:59.188
This is our

20:59.189 --> 21:00.292
ex-butler, Roger.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.083
Charmed.

21:02.626 --> 21:04.042
You're hired.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.709
- Don't you need
- to see my credentials?

21:05.751 --> 21:07.500
- I can see
- them from here.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.000
- I'm too young for this.
- Let's bounce.

21:12.209 --> 21:13.792
So, how do you

21:13.793 --> 21:15.375
feel about pirates?

21:15.417 --> 21:17.292
Oh! Shiver me timbers!

Aw!

21:31.336 --> 21:32.709
Isn't he adorable?

21:32.751 --> 21:34.230
Look, he's making

21:34.231 --> 21:35.709
those cute

21:32.751 --> 21:35.709
little snot bubbles.

21:35.751 --> 21:37.834
(CHUCKLES)

21:37.876 --> 21:39.147
I just got an A

21:39.148 --> 21:40.417
on my mid-term.

21:40.459 --> 21:41.563
Not that it counts.

21:41.564 --> 21:42.667
Stupid pass-fail!

21:43.834 --> 21:45.500
- Awesome, how
- does it feel?

21:45.542 --> 21:46.584
(CHUCKLES)

21:46.626 --> 21:48.125
- No, seriously,
- describe it to me.

21:48.167 --> 21:49.292
I've never gotten an A.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.042
It feels great.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.105
Almost as great as

21:53.106 --> 21:54.125
having Bertram back.
