At our reunion, she said shewished she was a better baker,

08:38.934 --> 08:42.730
and I said, anyone can masterthe most complicated recipes

08:42.772 --> 08:44.398
if they have the bestingredients

08:44.398 --> 08:45.983
and the right measurements.

Well, have a good night,Verna.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.502
Oh, trust me, I will.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.337
It's the only time I sleeplike a baby.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.465
Out here in the freshmountain air.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.467
Bye.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.844
Buh-bye.

09:59.181 --> 09:59.849
That was weird.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.142
Hmm.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.440
Oh, wait, here, hold this.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.317
I come bearing the giftof fitness.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.109
Cool.

10:10.151 --> 10:10.985
Mmhmm.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.570
I've always wantedone of these.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.447
Now you can countyour steps.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.325
Does it count your blessings,too?

10:17.366 --> 10:20.119
Cause today feels pretty greatwith you here,

10:20.161 --> 10:22.788
and Mom and Dad.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.833
I can't believe I'm gettingmarried in five days.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.501
Promise me we'll always bethis close,

10:27.501 --> 10:28.836
even after you're married?

10:28.836 --> 10:30.671
Always.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.173
Race you.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.147
[sighs] It's breathtakingup here.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.192
Sugar was right.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.737
We take for granted livingso close to the mountains.

10:54.779 --> 11:00.534
Listen, it's peace and quiet,just nature and us.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.161
[terrified screams] Somebody help!

11:02.203 --> 11:04.038
Do you hear that?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.664
[screaming]

11:05.706 --> 11:07.541
It's coming from down there.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.751
Come on.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.338

Help, it's Sugar, help me!

11:25.559 --> 11:27.520
Help!

11:27.561 --> 11:28.979
(Operator) 911, what's your emergency?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.523
I need help.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.024
A... a woman is drowning.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.985
Help! Help!!

11:35.027 --> 11:36.195
She's trapped!

11:36.237 --> 11:40.616
I'm at the... at the creek,at, uh, Clear Mountain.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.911
Ruby, come on, pull!

11:43.911 --> 11:44.829
[groans]

11:44.870 --> 11:45.579
Below the cliff.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.373
At... at Sunrise Point.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.624
[straining]

11:48.666 --> 11:49.708
Come on Sugar, please!

11:49.750 --> 11:51.043
She's trapped under a log.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.586
She's... she's in the water.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.839
[straining]

11:54.880 --> 11:56.757
Okay, this way.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.801
My sister is tryingto pull her out.

11:58.843 --> 11:59.468
Okay, I got her!

11:59.510 --> 12:01.345
I got her!

12:01.387 --> 12:02.930
Flip her!

12:02.972 --> 12:05.266
Oh, my gosh, Sugar!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.063
[sobbing]

12:11.105 --> 12:11.897
Come on, Sugar!

12:11.939 --> 12:12.731
Come on, Sugar!!

12:12.773 --> 12:14.442
Stay with me,stay with me!

12:14.442 --> 12:16.652
Her name is Sugar Albert.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.279
They're doing CPR now,please hurry.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.488
Please come back to me,please!

12:19.530 --> 12:22.783
Please, come back to me,Sugar! Please!

12:22.825 --> 12:24.285
Please. It's not working!

12:24.326 --> 12:26.120
It's not working!She's not breathing!

12:26.120 --> 12:27.037
Help me!

12:27.079 --> 12:29.123
It's okay. Take a break!Take a break!

12:29.123 --> 12:30.958
Sugar, please, please,please come back!

12:30.958 --> 12:32.126
She's not breathing!

12:32.126 --> 12:33.544
Come on, Sugar.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.504
Come on!

12:35.546 --> 12:37.631
[sobbing]

12:40.968 --> 12:44.221
So, how long were youout here hiking for?

12:44.263 --> 12:47.850
Um... An hour, about.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.310
Sugar wanted to go takea selfie

12:49.310 --> 12:53.189
up at Sunrise Pointfor our website.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.690
Did you go with her?

12:54.732 --> 12:57.318
No, I had to go backto the baking convention.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.277
What time?

12:58.319 --> 13:00.488
Um, around 7:00?

13:00.488 --> 13:04.116
How'd you know to come back,that she was in trouble?

13:04.158 --> 13:06.243
Excuse me?And you are?

13:06.285 --> 13:09.163
Detective Jake Killian.Seattle Homicide.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.331
Homicide?

13:10.331 --> 13:15.085
Yeah, it's standard protocolfor an unattended death.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.254
So, how'd you know she wasin trouble?

13:17.296 --> 13:21.717
Well, I was walking back, andthen I heard this faint scream,

13:21.759 --> 13:24.386
and I turned around and Istarted running towards it,

13:24.428 --> 13:28.224
and it got louder and louder,and then it just stopped.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.059
And it took me a coupleof minutes,

13:30.100 --> 13:31.227
but then I saw her.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.896
Sugar, she was trappedunder a log in the creek.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.231
And how was she trapped?

13:35.272 --> 13:37.817
Her body was jammedbetween the rocks and the log.

13:37.858 --> 13:38.943
Oh, you were here too?

13:38.984 --> 13:41.195
Yeah, I helped try to pullher out.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.197
My sister and I werehiking nearby.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.324
Any idea how she gotin the creek?

13:45.366 --> 13:46.492
She could have fallen.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.827
It rained overnight,gets real slippery.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.872
The current could've carried heruntil she hit the log.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.041
Could she swim, Megan?

13:54.083 --> 13:55.209
Yeah.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.753
Maybe she hit her headon the way down.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.171
Yeah, that's possible.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.382
I should have neverlet her go.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.134
You did everything you could.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.219
Okay, thanks everyone.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.721
Did... did we get their contactinformation?

14:07.721 --> 14:09.932
All right, we'll be in touch,okay.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.855
I can't believe she's gone.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.441
You need anything,anything at all, okay,

14:19.483 --> 14:20.401
you just call us.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.735
Thank you.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.237
Now get some rest.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.408
Okay to bag up the body?

14:27.408 --> 14:28.242
Not yet.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.368
I called the M.E.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.452
Really?

14:30.494 --> 14:32.580
Falls happen all the timearound these parts.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.999
My money is on an accidentaldrowning.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.084
Excuse me, I just got the call.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.503
Is that my wife?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.546
You Sam Albert?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.423
Yeah.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.300
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.551
What happened?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.762
We think she slipped and felloff the cliff up there.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.306
Uh, we're still investigating.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.890
Where are you...

14:51.932 --> 14:53.225
Where are you taking her?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.227
Oh, she'll be taken to themorgue when we're done here.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.604
The morgue?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.606
But if it was an accident, sheshould go to the funeral home.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.066
In cases like this, the M.E.has to do a full autopsy

15:01.108 --> 15:04.403
before returning the bodyto the family.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.280
Can I see her?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.366
Yeah, of course.You wanna show this to him.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.464
I'm gonna go backto the hotel.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.049
Okay.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.808
I know that look.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.518
I'm sorry, but you sawher husband.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.562
He acted like it wasa business deal.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.148
And how would you reactif that happened to Kevin?

15:41.148 --> 15:41.982
Not like that.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.901
Exactly.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.277
We should get back.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.197
Tell Mom the news.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.324
Yeah. Okay.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.581
Hang on a second.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.707
This is the point where

15:58.749 --> 16:01.835
the officer said Sugarcould've fallen from.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.505
Look, do you see that?

16:04.546 --> 16:08.884
Doesn't that look likefreshly broken branches?

16:08.926 --> 16:11.178
And that area right there,it looks...

16:11.220 --> 16:12.346
it looks like it'sbeen disturbed.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.390
Here, hold this.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.686
And the sign's crooked,too.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.896
[camera shutter snaps]

16:20.938 --> 16:22.690
Hey, look.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.525
Do you see that lens?

16:24.566 --> 16:28.112
I think that popped out ofsomeone's glasses.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.031
[camera shutter snaps]

16:31.073 --> 16:32.700
That would be a scary fall.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.411
Ruby, you're scaring me.What's going on?

16:35.452 --> 16:37.204
I need to talk to Dad.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.707
I'm not sure this isan accident.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.383
I can't believe Sugar's dead.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.219
It's obvious how much you cared for her, Mom.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.762
We're so sorry.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.308
Would you like some tea?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.810
I know.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.357
You need to talk?

17:05.398 --> 17:07.192
[sighs]

17:07.233 --> 17:08.609
-Yeah.-Come on.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.531
Something feels off.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.075
And there was a homicidedetective at the scene.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.243
You don't think Sugar's deathwas an accident?

17:17.243 --> 17:18.494
Right.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.080
It may be, I don't know, I don'thave half your instincts.

17:21.123 --> 17:21.832
No, no, no.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.915
Don't sell yourself short.

17:22.915 --> 17:24.251
Let's just talk it through.Talk to me.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.170
All right, just tell mewhat's bothering you.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.088
Well, the detective at the sceneautomatically assumed

17:28.088 --> 17:30.257
that Sugar fell off the cliffand drowned.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.467
Okay.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.886
But I got a good look at herbody when I was doing CPR.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.930
It was pristine,not a scratch.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.432
That's odd.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.391
Right?

17:39.433 --> 17:40.434
Yup.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.437
Look at these photos I tookat the scene.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.272
If she fell down that cliff,

17:45.272 --> 17:46.940
she would've hit the rocky slopeon the way down.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.026
And she would've hadvisible injuries.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.235
I don't think she fell.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.779
All right, can you prove it?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.448
Well, look, see that?

17:54.448 --> 17:55.908
Looks like there could'vebeen a fight.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.243
I mean, maybe someone triedto push Sugar,

17:58.285 --> 17:59.453
and she got away.

17:59.453 --> 18:03.332
And they chased her downto the creek,

18:03.373 --> 18:04.708
and... and drowned her.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.626
Right.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.086
And there's more.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.128
More?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.421
Sugar's husband, Sam,showed up at the creek,

18:09.463 --> 18:11.632
and he seemed completelydetached,

18:11.632 --> 18:14.551
unemotional for someonewhose wife just died.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.969
That's strange.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.971
Dad, what should I do?

18:18.013 --> 18:20.849
You need to followthat Herring hunch.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.477
You have always had a knackfor digging deeper

18:23.477 --> 18:26.814
on your consumer investigations,right?

18:26.855 --> 18:30.567
So, you could just dig deeperon this.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.783
I'll start running testsright away.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.992
Sure.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.328
Ruby?

18:41.370 --> 18:42.329
Tommy.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.373
I'm sorry, I didn't meanto interrupt.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.290
What are you doing here?

18:45.332 --> 18:47.835
You two know each other?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.044
Not really.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.003
We just met.

18:50.003 --> 18:50.921
Yup.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.631
Someone going to tell mewhat's going on?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.258
This is one of my witnesses.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.342
Witnesses?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.970
Yeah, I was at the scene todayon the mountain.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.013
Charlotte and I were hiking.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.558
Sugar Albert was one ofmy mom's good friends.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.477
Oh. Sorry, Ruby.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.354
I forgot that's whereCharlotte's wedding is

19:07.354 --> 19:08.438
this weekend.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.107
This has us all really rattled.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.776
Well, I'm sure Jake will getto the bottom of it.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.195
He just transferredfrom New York.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.864
Actually, I'm from Seattleoriginally.

19:16.905 --> 19:20.909
Ruby's an investigative consumerreporter from Channel 57.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.078
"News we can use."

19:23.120 --> 19:24.955
Her dad John's my godfather.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.874
John and my dad,they're best friends.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.041
Oh, small world.

19:28.041 --> 19:28.876
Sure is.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.502
So, Ruby, how can I help?

19:30.544 --> 19:33.881
I haven't startedthe autopsy yet.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.215
Maybe we should talk later.

19:35.257 --> 19:39.303
Well, if it's about the case,speak openly.

19:39.344 --> 19:45.225
Well, I'm... I'm worried Sugar'sdeath might not be an accident.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.729
Ruby... what was yourlast name again?

19:48.770 --> 19:49.396
Herring.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.814
Ruby Herring.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.649
As in "red herring?"

19:52.691 --> 19:53.734
Hmm, it's cute.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.069
Is it cute if a killer walks?

19:56.111 --> 19:58.530
Cause I think I saw some thingsthat could be evidence.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.823
Don't you have a weddingto go to?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.074
I'm fine.

20:01.116 --> 20:04.620
Maybe you two should move thisto my office.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.331
(whispers) I don't like tensionin front of the victims.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.248
Of course.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.917
I'll get startedon those x-rays.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.252
Thank you.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.130
I'll show you whereTommy's office is.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.054
I noticed the same thingabout the lack of injuries,

20:22.095 --> 20:24.598
but I'm not ready to callthis a murder.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.934
What if I told you Sugarwas threatened last night?

20:26.934 --> 20:29.519
I heard her on the phonearguing with someone.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.230
And you saw her husbandat the scene.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.524
He was cold as ice,barking out questions.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.362
Okay guys, let's seewhat these bones can tell us.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.614
Yeah, how about we do thisin private?

20:40.614 --> 20:42.616
[clears throat]

20:42.658 --> 20:45.077
Off the record, right Ruby?

20:45.118 --> 20:46.453
Absolutely.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.455
You can trust her.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.375
Fine.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.961
But against my better judgment.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.801
Good, so nothingbroken here.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.136
Nothing here either.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.721
No obvious head trauma.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.141
I'll look closer later, but Idon't see any major injuries.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.601
Also, didn't find any cutsexcept for

21:09.643 --> 21:11.520
where she was caughtunder the log.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.855
So, does this mean she didn'tfall off the cliff?

21:13.897 --> 21:15.857
Definitely raises doubt.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.484
I would expect to see traumato the body

21:17.484 --> 21:20.320
based on how you describedthe height and the terrain.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.739
Let's take a look at her lungs.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.950
Now we got something.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.493
You see that?

21:26.493 --> 21:27.869
Pulmonary edema.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.329
Fluid in the lungs.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.622
She likely drowned.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.041
Or someone drowned her.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.043
We still have to run a lot moretests to be sure,

21:35.085 --> 21:39.464
but I think there's enough hereto call this a suspicious death.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.674
Alrighty, then.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.718
I'll get started ona full autopsy.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.178
(Both) Good.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.514
Can I get a commenton the record?

21:47.556 --> 21:48.682
Not yet.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.350
And I'd appreciate you don'treport on anything

21:50.350 --> 21:51.852
you saw here today.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.812
If the public thinksit's an accident,

21:53.854 --> 21:56.064
then the killerwon't see me coming.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.275
Hmm, can't promise anything.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.193
Thank you for your time,Tommy.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.486
I'll see you at the wedding.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.572
Got my dancing shoesall ready.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.407
Save me a dance.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.036
[sighs]

22:09.703 --> 22:12.039
Any advice on how to get herto back off?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.707
Not really.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.876
[laughs]

22:15.876 --> 22:18.211
You don't know Ruby.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.382
A woman is dead.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.301
The police think that she could've been murdered.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.762
This New York City detectivecan't tell us how

22:26.803 --> 22:27.888
to do our jobs.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.473
He's actually from Seattle.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.515
What's his name?

22:30.557 --> 22:31.892
Jake Killian.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.643
Hmm, sounds handsome.What's he like?

22:33.685 --> 22:34.895
What is this,the dating game?

22:34.936 --> 22:37.064
I know that he's not happywith me poking my nose

22:37.064 --> 22:39.024
where he thinksit doesn't belong.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.400
Hmm.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.694
How do you feel about helpingCraig out on crime beat?

22:42.736 --> 22:45.113
You know since you have an inon the story.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.407
I don't know, this is my mom'sfriend we're talking about,

22:47.407 --> 22:48.950
and I have to get backto Charlotte.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.410
Oh, come on, Ruby.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.996
The baking event is at the samehotel as the wedding.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.624
There could be suspects,witnesses,

22:55.665 --> 22:57.250
right under your nose.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.087
The nose that doesn't belong.

23:00.128 --> 23:03.924
This is your mom's good friend,Ruby.

23:03.965 --> 23:04.633
Okay.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.760
Yeah, okay, I'll help.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.511
Great.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.387
I'll let Craig know.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.765
Ruby, is there any more news?

23:11.765 --> 23:13.934
Tommy thinks Sugar drowned,

23:13.934 --> 23:16.311
and there's no easy wayto tell you this, Mom,

23:16.353 --> 23:20.857
but the detective doesn't thinkit was an accident.

23:20.899 --> 23:21.691
What?

23:21.733 --> 23:23.318
You mean she was murdered?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.195
Right now he's calling itsuspicious,

23:25.237 --> 23:27.948
but Tommy's doing an autopsy.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.450
Who would do this to her?

23:30.450 --> 23:33.370
Do they think the killer's hereat the hotel?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.288
And what about Sugar's niece?

23:35.330 --> 23:36.957
She was at the scene.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.126
Megan? No, she triedto save her.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.628
I think it... could bethe husband.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.296
Mom, how well do you know Sam?

23:43.338 --> 23:44.673
Not well.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.800
Uh, Sugar met him after college.

23:46.800 --> 23:51.471
Uh, Frank wants me to do someinvestigating here at the hotel.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.057
If you think it'll findSugar's killer,

23:54.099 --> 23:55.976
then you should.

23:55.976 --> 24:00.272
I'm always here if you wannajust talk things through.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.982
If you... if you need it.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.567
Thanks, Dad.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.236
And Charlotte, I promise,as your Maid of Honour,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.238
you always come first.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.489
Hi, Herrings.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.324
My condolences about Sugar.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.826
I know you're all very close.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.327
Thank you.

24:14.327 --> 24:15.745
Uh, Derek.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.915
The station wants me to lookinto the story.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.125
I was wondering, uh,

24:20.167 --> 24:23.253
I was going to head overto the baker's conference.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.213
Maybe you could introduce meto the organizer?

24:25.255 --> 24:26.548
Oh, of course.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.299
Come with me.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.050
Great, thanks.

24:29.092 --> 24:29.676
Bye guys.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.760
Bye.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.268
Ellie, how you holding up?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.144
Okay.

24:39.186 --> 24:42.022
Our keynote speaker is dead.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.773
Not exactly good for business.

24:43.815 --> 24:48.028
Oh, uh, this is Ruby Herring,a friend of mine and Sugar's.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.947
Oh, my condolences.

24:50.989 --> 24:54.409
I recognize you,from TV, right?

24:54.451 --> 24:56.578
That's me,Channel 57 News.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.580
[cell phone dings]

24:59.539 --> 25:01.249
Oh, I'm wantedat the front desk.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.751
Uh, thanks, Derek.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.754
So, what brings youto our event?

25:05.795 --> 25:08.757
I'm actually staying here at thehotel for my sister's wedding.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.717
I was just curious about it.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.887
Okay. I'd be happyto show you around.

25:13.887 --> 25:14.721
That'd be great.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.264
Okay.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.943
Some bakers have alreadydeveloped products

25:27.984 --> 25:29.402
they're trying to sell.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.862
Others have business ideas

25:30.904 --> 25:32.781
and they're hoping to landan investor.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.950
Sugar and Sam actuallygot their start here.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.743
I didn't know that.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.997
So, this happened at 7:00 AM,right?

25:41.039 --> 25:41.665
Mmhmm.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.083
All right.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.086
Any other hikersin the area that...

25:46.086 --> 25:49.381
that might've seen something?

25:49.422 --> 25:50.548
It was early.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.592
The only people around wereRuby and Charlotte.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.718
Mmhmm.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.096
Did Sugar have any enemiesthat you know of?

25:56.137 --> 25:58.848
She was a tough business woman.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.350
Wait...

26:00.392 --> 26:02.269
Enemies?

26:02.269 --> 26:03.395
What are you saying?

26:03.436 --> 26:05.605
Oh, I'm just being thorough.

26:05.647 --> 26:06.940
Poor girl.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.361
If you'll excuse me, I'm goingto see how she's doing.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.862
Thank you for your time,Ellie.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.072
My pleasure.

26:14.114 --> 26:17.242
Come back next year when thingsare back to normal.

26:21.788 --> 26:22.747
Hi, Megan.

26:22.789 --> 26:23.540
Hey.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.541
Detective.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.960
We seem to keep bumpinginto each other.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.963
I'm beginning to thinkyou're following me.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.465
How are you holding up?

26:32.465 --> 26:34.884
Honestly? I'm numb.

26:34.926 --> 26:38.680
This has been likea bad dream.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.265
Well, thank youfor your time.

26:40.307 --> 26:43.018
We'll be in touch, okay?

26:49.482 --> 26:50.900
Can you tell mewhat's going on here?

26:50.942 --> 26:54.195
Why does that detectivekeep asking me questions?

26:54.237 --> 26:56.823
(quietly) Someone might've beenout to get Sugar.

26:56.823 --> 26:59.743
Seriously? But why?

26:59.784 --> 27:02.329
Everybody looked up to Sugar.

27:02.370 --> 27:05.332
She wasn't just my aunt,Ruby.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.292
She was my mentor.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.045
I can only imagine how hardthis is for you.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.797
Uh, you said that Sugartook selfies,

27:12.839 --> 27:16.509
do you know if she posted themto the website?

27:16.509 --> 27:18.845
No. But, um, she sent themto me

27:18.845 --> 27:21.181
because I do the socialmedia stuff.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.183
Do you still have them?

27:23.224 --> 27:26.269
Yeah, I just shared themwith that detective.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.271
Could I take a look?

27:38.823 --> 27:41.076
Do you mind if I send theseto myself?

27:41.117 --> 27:42.952
No problem.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.037
Thanks.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.375
Great.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.835
May I have your attention,please?

27:50.877 --> 27:53.838
I know we're all saddenedand shocked

27:53.880 --> 27:57.759
by the passing of ourdear friend, Sugar Albert.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.260
She was a visionary.

27:59.302 --> 28:02.430
I have a quick notefrom her husband Sam here

28:02.472 --> 28:04.057
that I'd like to share with you.

28:04.099 --> 28:08.061
"I want to thank you foryour prayers and condolences.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.272
"Sugar and I were notonly partners in business,

28:11.314 --> 28:14.025
"but partners in life.

28:14.067 --> 28:17.070
"We had a saying.

28:17.112 --> 28:20.240
"A couple that bakes together,stays together."

28:20.281 --> 28:22.909
[laughs mockingly]"Bakes together stays together."

28:22.951 --> 28:24.536
That's ridiculous.

28:24.577 --> 28:25.495
What do you mean?

28:25.537 --> 28:26.746
Well.

28:26.788 --> 28:30.625
I'm not one to gossip, but Sugarand Sam were all business.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.669
That was a sham marriageif I ever saw one.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.504
"...Hope to see you there."

28:34.546 --> 28:36.047
Thank you.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.800
I'm Ruby.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.886
Ah, Marian Rabbel.Marian's Organic Bakery.

28:41.928 --> 28:42.554
[laughs]

28:42.595 --> 28:43.930
I was Sugar's mentor.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.056
Taught her everythingshe knew about

28:45.098 --> 28:47.142
the organic baking business.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.227
Not that she was ever grateful.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.272
She stole some ofmy best recipes.

28:54.315 --> 28:57.861
So, you're the one behind allSugar and Sam's great recipes.

28:57.902 --> 29:01.364
Well, I'm not one to brag,but yes.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.324
Do you come to this conferenceevery year?

29:03.366 --> 29:04.492
I do, yes.

29:04.534 --> 29:07.120
It's nice to see whatthe competition is up to.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.621
Well, hopefully it's notall work.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.124
I mean, did you get a chanceto see the hiking trails?

29:11.124 --> 29:12.125
They're spectacular.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.960
Oh, no. I don't...

29:14.002 --> 29:15.962
Marian?

29:15.962 --> 29:17.756
Can we please talk,Nicole?

29:17.797 --> 29:19.299
Talk to my lawyer.

29:19.340 --> 29:19.966
[sighs]

29:19.966 --> 29:21.009
Yikes, who was that?

29:21.050 --> 29:22.802
Oh, another traitor.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.637
Who knew bakerscould be so bitter?

29:24.679 --> 29:26.014
[laughs]

29:26.055 --> 29:27.140
Are you Ruby Herring?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.058
The investigative reporter?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.185
Yes.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.896
I knew it, you have the mostbeautiful red hair.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.314
Will you take a selfie with me?

29:34.355 --> 29:36.065
Okay.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.192
[shutter snaps]

29:37.233 --> 29:38.902
I got my money backfrom a shady car repairman

29:38.943 --> 29:40.278
because of you.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.739
"News we can use."

29:42.780 --> 29:46.951
Your timelines have a lot ofinconsistencies, Mr. Albert.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.787
I'm telling you the truth.

29:48.828 --> 29:52.957
Well, you told me you were inyour car still 20 minutes away

29:52.999 --> 29:56.544
from the hotel when you gotthe news about your wife.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.297
Yep, that sounds about right,yeah.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.882
Yeah.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.677
You see, the problem is,I've got your phone records.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.095
You can't do that.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.681
Well, you're on a joint planwith your wife, so...

30:08.723 --> 30:10.141
yeah, I can.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.977
And they tell me that your cellphone is pinging off a tower

30:13.019 --> 30:17.357
near the hotel at that time,which means you weren't driving,

30:17.398 --> 30:18.900
you were at the resort.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.528
It was a frantic day.

30:21.528 --> 30:26.533
Maybe I was closerthan I thought.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.409
Tell me.

30:28.451 --> 30:29.869
How's your marriage?

30:29.869 --> 30:35.708
We had our ups and downslike every other couple.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.253
But I loved Sugar.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.380
Can you tell me about the fightyou had with her last night?

30:40.380 --> 30:41.881
How do you know about that?

30:41.881 --> 30:43.633
Just answer the question.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.386
It was a business disagreement.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.012
Hmm.

30:48.054 --> 30:52.517
You, um, you ever gone hikingaround the trails in the hotel?

30:52.559 --> 30:54.060
No, that was Sugar's thing.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.729
Can you tell me whereyou're going with all of this,Detective?

30:56.771 --> 30:59.274
The officer said thatit was an accident.

30:59.315 --> 31:02.527
Yeah, well, that officerwas mistaken.

31:05.071 --> 31:08.908
Do I need to get myselfa lawyer?

31:08.908 --> 31:10.118
Well, have you done anythingwrong?

31:10.159 --> 31:12.120
No.

31:12.161 --> 31:13.997
I've answeredall your questions.

31:14.038 --> 31:14.956
I'd like to go now.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.416
You're free to go.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.418
But don't go far.

31:18.418 --> 31:25.091
Oh, and uh, with Sugar'sdeath... the business.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.635
It's all yours now, right?

31:37.604 --> 31:39.439
So, what are Kevin andthe groomsmen wearing

31:39.439 --> 31:40.607
in their boutonnières?

31:40.648 --> 31:43.109
White roses to complimentmy bouquet.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.652
Great.

31:44.694 --> 31:45.528
[phone rings]

31:45.570 --> 31:46.571
Oh, it's Angela.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.781
Give me a second.

31:48.781 --> 31:49.949
Hi, Ange.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.826
What's the latest on the case?

31:51.868 --> 31:53.870
Well, I'm still suspiciousof the husband,

31:53.912 --> 31:57.790
so I'm keeping an eye on him,but in the meantime,

31:57.832 --> 31:59.626
I met someone today.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.461
As in a date for the wedding?

32:01.461 --> 32:02.295
No, Cupid.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.756
You're just as bad as my sister.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.466
A new suspect.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.967
Do tell.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.511
Okay, go online. Her name is Marian Rabbel.

32:10.553 --> 32:11.888
R-A-B-B-E-L.

32:11.930 --> 32:12.972
Okay.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.938
She doesn't look like a killer.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.439
Well, she's not wearing darkglasses and a hoodie,

32:21.481 --> 32:23.149
but she's got a bite to her.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.151
And she had a feudwith Sugar.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.153
She posted something earlier,did you see it?

32:27.153 --> 32:28.488
It's cryptic.

32:28.529 --> 32:29.989
This one.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.699
"Cut sugar out of your life.

32:31.741 --> 32:34.452
You're better off without her."

32:34.494 --> 32:35.662
What does that mean?

32:35.703 --> 32:39.082
Is that a typo or evil subtlety?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.166
I'd say the latter.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.293
She said that Sugar's marriagewas a sham,

32:42.335 --> 32:44.462
and maybe Sam and Sugarweren't even together.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.881
So, you're back to thinkingthat the husband's a suspect?

32:46.923 --> 32:49.884
I know, I know, this whole crimething is like a twisted game

32:49.926 --> 32:51.844
of ping-pong.

32:51.844 --> 32:52.637
I have an idea.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.013
Okay?

32:54.055 --> 32:55.348
Will you check out the accounting clerk's website for me,

32:55.348 --> 32:56.683
make sure those two are even married?

32:56.724 --> 32:59.560
And her real nameis Verna Albert.

32:59.602 --> 33:02.063
I can see why she went with Sugar.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.315
Good call, Ruby.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.359
They filed for divorcenot too long ago.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.027
Oh, but wait...

33:08.069 --> 33:11.364
They withdrew their filing

33:11.406 --> 33:14.826
and there are two differentaddresses listed.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.745
Hmm, maybe Marian was right.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.080
Ruby.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.791
We need your opinion over hereon the bridesmaid bouquets.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.000
Angela, I gotta run.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.378
Let me know if you findanything else.

33:25.878 --> 33:28.089
Like I said, Detective.It's policy.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.341
Policy. Okay.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.010
All I'm asking for is yoursurveillance video

33:33.052 --> 33:35.346
from yesterday morning.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.557
Simple.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.892
If I have to get a warrant,I will,

33:39.892 --> 33:42.979
and I can have officerscrawling all over this place.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.397
I didn't say I wouldn'tgive it to you,

33:44.439 --> 33:46.858
I told you I needed to clear itby corporate,

33:46.899 --> 33:49.569
which I will do first thingin the morning.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.612
You know, I'm gonna meet youguys in the restaurant.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.906
Is that the detective?

33:53.948 --> 33:55.241
He's cute.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.534
Are you serious right now?

33:56.576 --> 33:57.994
Yeah.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.330
Gentlemen.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.875
Looking gorgeous as ever,Ruby.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.084
You know this guy?

34:05.126 --> 34:06.502
You know this guy?

34:06.544 --> 34:08.795
Yes, and yes.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.422
Uh, is everything okay?

34:10.465 --> 34:13.592
I was explaining companypolicy to the detective.

34:13.592 --> 34:18.014
Call me the second you hearfrom corporate.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.183
Ah, no taste at all.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.268
Does that tactic ever workfor you?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.271
I know what I'm doin'.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.106
Can I talk to you for a second?

34:27.148 --> 34:30.025
Yeah, I guess, since I haveno video to look at.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.527
Great.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.616
Look what Marian postedon her page.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.784
Oh, sugar-free cookies.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.328
Yeah, she definitely killed her.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.621
You're not readingbetween the lines.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.748
Between that and the mudon her shoes?

34:43.790 --> 34:45.958
Do you know how many people hikearound this place?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.251
Okay, then how about Sam?

34:47.293 --> 34:49.128
Did you know that he and Sugarfiled for divorce,

34:49.128 --> 34:50.630
and then later changedtheir mind?

34:50.670 --> 34:52.380
I bet their company's wortha fortune.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.466
$15 million.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.967
A better motive than stealingcookie recipes.

34:55.967 --> 34:56.969
Look, I gotta go.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.263
Wait, can I show yousomething else?

34:59.305 --> 35:01.140
It's important.

35:01.140 --> 35:01.766
All right.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.975
[clears throat]

35:02.975 --> 35:04.352
I took photos at Sunrise Pointon the cliff's edge,

35:04.393 --> 35:06.020
right after Sugar died.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.814
Yeah, we took our photos too.

35:07.814 --> 35:08.940
Okay, so then you sawthe difference

35:08.981 --> 35:10.149
between Sugar's selfies

35:10.191 --> 35:13.027
and the photos taken laterat the exact same point?

35:13.069 --> 35:15.238
Yeah, I'm meeting our cyber guyin the morning.

35:15.279 --> 35:18.032
Okay, well, I'm no cyber expert,but look.

35:18.074 --> 35:21.494
In Sugar's selfies takenat 6:28 AM at Sunrise Point,

35:21.536 --> 35:24.330
the sign and the branchesare intact.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.458
In my photos, taken at 8:32,

35:27.500 --> 35:29.752
the sign is crooked andthe branches are broken.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.380
Oh, and did you see the lenson the ground?

35:32.421 --> 35:33.965
Yeah, we took it in for testing.

35:34.006 --> 35:35.174
Well, does Sam wear glasses?

35:35.216 --> 35:37.426
Have you brought him in yet?

35:37.468 --> 35:38.427
I can't tell you that.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.679
You did, didn't you?

35:39.679 --> 35:43.099
He is a person of interest,and that's all we know.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.351
And that's off the record.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.895
Look, tough to step awayand let me do my job.

35:47.937 --> 35:50.106
I think you're forgettingthis is my job.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.568
Oh, well I thought you were"news we can use,"

35:53.609 --> 35:57.321
"do your homework," "a littletime saves a lot of money."

35:57.363 --> 35:58.447
You watched?

35:58.489 --> 36:01.534
Yeah, I uh, I caught a couplesegments online.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.870
We could work together,you know.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.789
No, sorry. I only workfor Law Enforcement.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.207
See you, Ruby.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.334
[sighs]

36:10.376 --> 36:11.752
Ouch.

36:15.548 --> 36:16.382
Hi, Frank.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.008
Ruby.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.301
What do you got for me?

36:18.342 --> 36:19.385
There's been a breakin the case,

36:19.385 --> 36:21.387
but not to be reportedyet, okay?

36:21.429 --> 36:24.348
Uh, let me hear what it is,first.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.602
They're looking into Sam Albert,the husband.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.604
Ha, it's always the husband.

36:29.645 --> 36:30.730
Nice work.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.356
Well, they're just lookinginto him for now.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.150
I'll keep you posted.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.114
(TV) There are new developments in the suspicious death

36:40.156 --> 36:41.866
of Sugar Albert.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.785
Albert died yesterday morningduring a hike near her hotel.

36:44.827 --> 36:47.997
It was initially believed to bean accidental fall off a cliff.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.374
But was later ruled to be a suspicious death.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.084
Police are now looking at her husband,

36:52.084 --> 36:54.337
and business partner,Sam Albert,

36:54.378 --> 36:55.421
as a person of interest.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.465
[chokes and coughs]

36:57.506 --> 36:59.217
The big question now... was it murder?

36:59.258 --> 37:01.928
This is Craig Powers, on the Crime Beat.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.473
Hi, Ruby.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.558
Oh, Ellie. Hi.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.936
That was such a sweet noteyou read from Sam

37:09.977 --> 37:11.938
at the baker's conferenceyesterday.

37:11.979 --> 37:14.273
What a love story.

37:14.315 --> 37:18.361
I can't imagine losing your bestfriend and business partner.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.612
How is he doing?

37:19.612 --> 37:24.367
Sam's doing just fine,despite a certain news report.

37:24.408 --> 37:29.121
Yeah... How welldo you know Sam?

37:29.163 --> 37:31.791
We're acquaintances.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.293
How about that news report?

37:34.335 --> 37:35.378
The mystery deepens.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.798
Wait, Ellie, I just had...

37:38.839 --> 37:41.842
So only a few days tillCharlotte's big day.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.302
I'm sorry you have to doall of this.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.972
I know, I should bein full wedding mode.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.640
Hey, can I ask youa question?

37:47.682 --> 37:50.685
Did Sam check in to the hotelthe morning that Sugar died?

37:50.726 --> 37:52.353
As I told that pushy detective,

37:52.395 --> 37:55.106
I can't disclose personalguest information.

37:55.147 --> 37:57.400
Not even a friend ofthe guest?

37:57.441 --> 38:00.152
Well, technically,since Sam isn't a guest,

38:00.152 --> 38:02.029
I guess I can makean exception.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.782
Wait, are you saying that Samdidn't check in?

38:04.824 --> 38:05.741
Nope.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.076
Sugar and Sam requestedadjoining rooms,

38:07.118 --> 38:09.412
so he needed to check into get his own key.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.831
Huh.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.875
Do you think maybe I couldpossibly take a peek

38:14.917 --> 38:17.545
at the surveillance videos?

38:17.586 --> 38:19.088
I don't have a badge.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.923
Plus, don't you want to knowwhat happened to Sugar?

38:20.965 --> 38:23.259
Nothing like a good mysteryat the hotel.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.761
Well... I supposeI owe you one

38:25.803 --> 38:28.431
because you helped me passcalculus in senior year.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.182
Hmm.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.309
Lead the way.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.065
Everything goes on the cloud.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.400
Just click on the thumbnails

38:39.442 --> 38:42.236
and you'll get times and locations on the property.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.362
You're amazing.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.531
Oh, by the way, you saidsomething in the kitchen

38:45.573 --> 38:47.533
about Sugar the daywe arrived?

38:47.575 --> 38:49.535
It didn't mean much then,but now...

38:49.577 --> 38:50.703
Oh, my comment about

38:50.703 --> 38:53.039
"not working with the granddame of baking?"

38:53.080 --> 38:55.207
She was close to offeringme a job.

38:55.207 --> 38:57.793
You know I have a degree in uh,food science, right?

38:57.835 --> 38:59.211
How did I not know that?

38:59.211 --> 39:00.087
It's true.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.839
Well, at the very last minute,

39:01.881 --> 39:03.549
she offered the jobto her niece.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.967
Nepotism at its best.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.886
I was surely more qualifiedfor the job,

39:06.886 --> 39:09.764
but the two were so close.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.058
I know she was a family friendof yours,

39:12.099 --> 39:15.227
but her nickname wasSugar the Shrew.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.438
Mm. Harsh.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.065
All right, let's get to work.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.733
We've got a lot of videoto get through.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.485
Hmm-mm.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.412
(Ruby) Wait, there he is, at 6:00 AM.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.247
(Derek) What floor is that?

39:35.289 --> 39:36.749
(Ruby) Looks like the first floor.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.001
Uh, that's room 102,our largest suite.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.921
Let me check the guest registry.

39:43.422 --> 39:44.757
Ellie Bluth.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.134
Ellie Bluth.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.721
Well, let's see what timehe left the room.

39:52.473 --> 39:55.518
Ah, he didn't leave againuntil 7:30.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.978
Sugar died a little after 7:00.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.106
That could clear him.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.191
I'm not convinced.

40:05.111 --> 40:09.281
I saw Ruby talking to a veryattractive police officer.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.117
Any updates fromDetective Dreamy?

40:11.117 --> 40:14.245
It's Detective Killian,and after this morning

40:14.286 --> 40:17.289
I'm pretty sure he'll never talkto me again.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.959
Frank ran the story about Sambeing a person of interest,

40:19.959 --> 40:21.669
even though I asked him not to.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.963
But this is becoming a reallybig story in town.

40:24.004 --> 40:26.132
Not just here, it's beenon the news everywhere.

40:26.173 --> 40:28.759
Yeah, even though Jake is stillcalling it a suspicious death.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.595
It's like he's waiting for aconfession to fall on his lap.

40:31.637 --> 40:32.638
Ruby, um...

40:32.638 --> 40:34.598
I mean, he was a New YorkCity detective,

40:34.640 --> 40:37.309
I can't imagine they workedat this pace there.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.979
He's so stubborn.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.772
Well, maybe he's just thorough.

40:41.814 --> 40:42.731
Hi.

40:42.773 --> 40:43.983
Standing here.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.317
(flustered)Detective...

40:45.317 --> 40:46.652
I... I was...

40:46.652 --> 40:50.698
Mom, um, we have a meetingwith the pastry chef, remember?

40:50.739 --> 40:52.241
Sorry man, he's makinga cake

40:52.283 --> 40:56.620
in the shape of a golf course,so...

40:56.662 --> 41:01.792
Detective, we could really usesome help filling these bags.

41:03.252 --> 41:06.088
Oh. Um, okay.

41:10.509 --> 41:11.844
Is she serious?

41:11.886 --> 41:12.887
Oh, yeah.

41:12.928 --> 41:15.222
Mom doesn't joke about hercandied almonds.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.307
Oh.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.225
[clears throat]

41:18.267 --> 41:20.853
I'm sorry about this morning.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.396
You know, maybe sinceyou don't cover crime,

41:22.438 --> 41:24.607
I should tell you that"off the record" means

41:24.648 --> 41:26.358
"not reportingcritical information."

41:26.400 --> 41:27.735
Yes, I know what it means,

41:27.776 --> 41:29.904
and I did ask my bossnot to run it.

41:29.945 --> 41:31.947
I thought you werethe reporter on this.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.032
Don't you have any say?

41:33.073 --> 41:35.868
No. Remember, I'ma consumer reporter.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.077
Yeah, I'm only helpingout on this

41:37.119 --> 41:39.246
because I was at the sceneof the crime,

41:39.288 --> 41:41.582
and because Sugar's a friend.

41:41.624 --> 41:46.337
I didn't ask for this story.Literally stumbled onto it.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.380
Crime is my dad's thing.

41:48.422 --> 41:51.550
Yeah, he's quite the legend backin the department.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.385
Yeah, he had a real knackfor it.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.387
And the detectivesrespected him.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.389
Seemed like uh, it'd bea natural fit for you

41:57.431 --> 41:59.850
to cover crime too, no?

41:59.892 --> 42:02.978
I never wanted to be comparedto my dad.

42:03.020 --> 42:07.691
To be honest, I was afraidI'd let people down

42:07.733 --> 42:10.402
if I didn't live upto his reputation.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.363
And most importantly, I didn'twant to let him down.

42:12.404 --> 42:14.490
Yeah, and I don't want to letmy chief down.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.908
Sugar's a big name in this town,

42:15.950 --> 42:19.828
and it's my first casein Seattle.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.456
I'm, uh, glad I could help outwith the wedding prep,

42:22.498 --> 42:25.668
but I've gotta go see ahighfalutin manager about,

42:25.709 --> 42:27.419
uh, these security videos.

42:27.461 --> 42:31.257
Um, yeah, about that.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.883
I kind of already saw 'em.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.260
I knew you were gonnasay that.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.594
Get this.

42:35.594 --> 42:38.222
Sam was already in the hotelthe morning that Sugar died.

42:38.264 --> 42:40.349
He was walkinginto a room at 6:00 AM.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.935
Okay, well, I guess thatexplains why his cellphone

42:42.935 --> 42:45.980
was pinging off local towers.

42:46.021 --> 42:47.147
You know the room?

42:47.189 --> 42:48.357
Ellie Bluth.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.483
Oh.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.360
Baking fair organizer, huh?

42:51.402 --> 42:53.988
I wonder why he wentto her room so early.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.282
Well, whatever the reason was,

42:56.282 --> 42:59.451
Sugar was murderedaround 7:00 AM,

42:59.493 --> 43:02.955
so Sam couldn't have killed herif he was with Ellie.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.791
It was room 102.The ground floor.

43:05.833 --> 43:09.253
They have patios, so theycould've both slipped out.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.254
Exactly.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.422
Right.

43:11.463 --> 43:12.965
And Ellie's still here,so we could go talk to her.

43:12.965 --> 43:13.966
We?

43:13.966 --> 43:14.800
[laughs]

43:14.800 --> 43:16.844
Ruby, I got this.

43:16.885 --> 43:17.970
But I know her.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.179
Okay, how about I give youthe exclusive

43:19.221 --> 43:24.435
when I'm ready to make the storypublic, okay?

43:24.476 --> 43:25.436
Okay.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.314
Ruby, there's a problem.

43:28.314 --> 43:29.606
[sighs]

43:30.649 --> 43:32.067
He came down with the flu.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.902
I'm so sorry.

43:33.944 --> 43:35.821
Oh, I'll start callingall the bakeries.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.114
This wedding is cursed.

43:37.156 --> 43:37.906
No, no, no.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.366
Don't say that, dear.

43:39.408 --> 43:41.035
Hi ladies.

43:41.076 --> 43:43.746
Just here to pick upall my baking tools.

43:43.787 --> 43:46.165
I'm headed home today.

43:46.165 --> 43:47.416
Is everything okay?

43:47.458 --> 43:50.169
We don't have anyone to bakeCharlotte's cake.

43:50.210 --> 43:52.004
Oh, I could do it.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.048
You have so much going onright now.

43:54.089 --> 43:56.008
Oh, we could never ask youto do that.

43:56.050 --> 43:59.345
It would actually really help metake my mind off things.

43:59.345 --> 44:04.058
I haven't slept in days,and this has been really hard.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.851
Oh, you poor thing.

44:05.851 --> 44:07.186
Are you sure?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.312
I'd be honoured.

44:08.354 --> 44:11.315
I could use Sugar's sketch.

44:13.859 --> 44:15.319
[knocking]

44:20.157 --> 44:21.492
Ellie Bluth?

44:21.533 --> 44:22.368
Can I help you?

44:22.409 --> 44:23.619
Yeah, Detective Killian.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.120
Seattle PD.

44:25.162 --> 44:28.374
I need to ask you some questionsabout Sugar Albert's death.

44:28.374 --> 44:30.709
Well, I really don't knowanything.

44:30.751 --> 44:35.172
Why was Sam Albert in your roomthe morning she died?

44:35.214 --> 44:37.883
[uncomfortably]Um, he came by to go over

44:37.883 --> 44:41.387
some last-minute arrangementsfor the conference.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.931
At 6:00 AM in the morning?

44:43.972 --> 44:45.391
We had a lot to do.

44:45.432 --> 44:48.143
That was the first day.

44:48.185 --> 44:50.396
I know you're insinuating thatSam could've had something

44:50.396 --> 44:54.191
to do with Sugar's death,but he was here with me.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.068
The whole time.

44:56.110 --> 44:59.947
I really have to go now,Detective. Um...

45:05.285 --> 45:06.745
Sam? Where are you?

45:06.787 --> 45:08.914
Call me.

45:08.914 --> 45:11.417
[sighs]

45:11.417 --> 45:12.835
Oh, hi, Ellie.

45:12.876 --> 45:13.836
Ruby.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.170
You seem to pop up a lot.

45:15.212 --> 45:19.383
I just had a few questionsfor you.

45:19.425 --> 45:23.178
So now you're playing bridesmaidand detective?

45:23.220 --> 45:26.557
I'm just trying to find outthe truth.

45:26.598 --> 45:29.893
My mom can barely focus on mysister's wedding she's so upset,

45:29.935 --> 45:33.981
but thank you for your time.

45:35.023 --> 45:36.567
Wait.

45:37.568 --> 45:40.612
If you want to know who reallyhad it out for Sugar,

45:40.654 --> 45:43.365
talk to Marian Rabbel,the baker.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.117
There was bad bloodbetween those two.

45:45.159 --> 45:46.952
I know that Sugarstole some recipes,

45:46.952 --> 45:48.620
but was there more to it?

45:48.662 --> 45:49.955
A lot more.

45:49.997 --> 45:52.791
Marian was the first to havean organic bakery in the area.

45:52.791 --> 45:54.960
She was Sugar's mentorbefore she left

45:55.002 --> 45:56.879
to start her own business.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.132
Not only did Sugar becomethe main competitor,

46:00.174 --> 46:04.178
but Sugar and Sam kept gettingbigger and bigger.

46:04.219 --> 46:05.512
Marian didn't like it.

46:05.554 --> 46:07.306
She didn't take it very well.

46:07.306 --> 46:08.849
Enough to kill her?

46:08.891 --> 46:12.352
Truth be told, she does havequite the temper.

46:12.394 --> 46:14.271
You should talk to herpartner of hers,

46:14.313 --> 46:15.647
Nicole Wellworth.

46:15.689 --> 46:17.816
Actually, soon to beformer partner.

46:17.858 --> 46:20.819
They're trying to sellthe business and part ways.

46:20.861 --> 46:22.321
Can I ask you justone more question?

46:22.321 --> 46:26.074
Do you know why Sam andSugar called off their divorce?

46:26.116 --> 46:28.494
I think I've told you enough.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.840
[rain patters]

46:41.840 --> 46:43.675
Uh, Detective.

46:43.675 --> 46:46.678
Detective.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.640
I just talked to Ellie.

46:49.681 --> 46:50.891
Of course you did.

46:50.933 --> 46:53.352
She said that we should belooking into Marian Rabbel.

46:53.352 --> 46:56.563
To divert attention awayfrom her and Sam.

46:56.605 --> 46:58.565
She's already sayingthey're each other's alibis.

46:58.607 --> 47:00.609
So, are you gonna bringSam in again?

47:00.651 --> 47:03.028
He lawyered up.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.864
What about the autopsy?Is it done?

47:05.864 --> 47:07.699
Bye, Ruby.

47:11.036 --> 47:14.164
[rain patters]

47:16.542 --> 47:18.710
[phone rings]

47:18.710 --> 47:19.878
Tommy Madden.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.129
Tommy, it's Ruby.

47:21.171 --> 47:23.215
What's the latestwith Sugar's autopsy?

47:23.257 --> 47:24.800
Off the record,right Ruby?

47:24.842 --> 47:26.802
Detective Killianwill have my head.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.303
Yes, of course.

47:28.345 --> 47:30.472
I'm expecting the lastof my tests back today.

47:30.514 --> 47:32.182
In the meantime,after you left,

47:32.224 --> 47:34.101
some post-mortem bruising appeared.

47:34.142 --> 47:36.311
I found a foot-sized bruise on her back.

47:36.353 --> 47:37.271
Really?

47:37.312 --> 47:38.730
What do you think it means?

47:38.730 --> 47:42.025
Well, she was either kicked orforcibly pushed down by someone.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.403
So now can you officiallycall it murder?

47:44.403 --> 47:46.905
I'll have my final rulingby the end of the day.

47:46.905 --> 47:48.657
Okay, I'll see you later.

47:48.699 --> 47:51.076
I'm on my way to check outa lead.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.590
[knocking]

48:08.927 --> 48:09.928
Nicole?

48:09.928 --> 48:11.930
Hi, I'm Ruby Herringwith Channel 57 news.

48:11.972 --> 48:14.933
I saw you at the baker'sconference yesterday?

48:14.933 --> 48:16.310
How can I help you?

48:16.351 --> 48:19.605
I just wanted to ask you afew questions about Marian.

48:19.646 --> 48:21.064
I can't talk about her.

48:21.106 --> 48:23.317
We're in the middleof some legal stuff.

48:23.358 --> 48:25.527
It's about Sugar Albert's death.

48:25.569 --> 48:26.778
What about it?

48:26.778 --> 48:29.448
I heard Marian had somepretty big issues with Sugar.

48:29.448 --> 48:31.783
Just looking into some motivesfor the news.

48:31.825 --> 48:34.453
Wait, you think Mariancould've done this?

48:34.453 --> 48:37.623
I didn't say that.

48:37.623 --> 48:40.375
How do you take your coffee?

48:42.169 --> 48:44.421
Mmm.

48:44.463 --> 48:45.505
It's delicious.

48:45.547 --> 48:46.590
Hm.

48:48.508 --> 48:50.594
I'll talk to you about Marian.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.512
But not on TV.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.641
So, um, how longdid you know Marian?

48:55.641 --> 48:57.934
She brought me in as a partnera few years ago.

48:57.976 --> 49:01.355
Mmm.

49:01.396 --> 49:04.524
I think this is the bestmarble cake I've ever had.

49:04.566 --> 49:07.527
I can see why Marian wantedto go into business with you.

49:07.569 --> 49:09.071
It's a secret family recipe.

49:09.112 --> 49:09.988
Mmm.

49:09.988 --> 49:12.491
But the businessisn't doing so well?

49:12.491 --> 49:15.452
We started losing moneyafter I signed on.

49:15.494 --> 49:17.204
The bakery was emptyhalf the time.

49:17.245 --> 49:19.831
Couldn't competewith Sugar and Sam.

49:19.873 --> 49:20.999
Their flagship store

49:20.999 --> 49:23.043
became a real touristdestination in Seattle.

49:23.085 --> 49:27.047
Anyway, Marian startedcutting corners behind my back.

49:27.089 --> 49:29.174
Using cheap ingredients.

49:29.174 --> 49:31.301
We were supposedto be all-organic.

49:31.343 --> 49:33.345
Did anyone else knowabout this?

49:33.387 --> 49:36.014
A supplier told Sugar,

49:36.014 --> 49:39.518
and that's whereit gets complicated.

49:39.518 --> 49:41.269
Marian was in the middleof suing Sugar

49:41.311 --> 49:42.938
for stealing her recipes.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.524
So, when Sugar foundout Marian's secret,

49:45.565 --> 49:47.025
she used that against her.

49:47.025 --> 49:50.070
As in, "drop the lawsuitor be exposed."

49:50.112 --> 49:51.196
Yes.

49:51.196 --> 49:52.906
Sugar was going to destroyMarian's reputation,

49:52.948 --> 49:55.742
and mine too since I washalf owner of the bakery.

49:55.784 --> 49:57.577
So, what's it like to workwith Marian?

49:57.619 --> 50:00.288
Oh, that woman has a temper.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.249
What, is she violent?

50:02.290 --> 50:04.960
She'll throw a few thingsin the kitchen.

50:05.001 --> 50:08.380
But if you're asking ifshe could murder someone?

50:08.380 --> 50:10.924
I find that hard to believe.

50:13.218 --> 50:14.928
You've reached the voicemail of Detective Killian,

50:14.970 --> 50:16.680
Seattle PD Homicide.

50:16.722 --> 50:17.764
Leave a message.

50:17.806 --> 50:19.433
Detective, it' s Ruby.

50:19.474 --> 50:21.184
I know you're not interestedin the cookie lady,

50:21.226 --> 50:26.565
but I learned some pretty crazystuff about her feud with Sugar.

50:26.606 --> 50:28.984
I'm headed to her bakery now.

50:33.447 --> 50:38.201
[door bells jingle]

50:38.243 --> 50:39.327
Hello?

50:40.746 --> 50:42.122
Hello?

50:42.164 --> 50:45.208
Hello, anyone here?

50:45.250 --> 50:46.752
Who said you couldcome back here?

50:46.793 --> 50:48.420
Marian, you scared me.

50:48.420 --> 50:52.215
Are you here as a customeror a reporter?

50:52.257 --> 50:53.175
Both.

50:53.216 --> 50:55.260
I'd be happyto buy something.

50:55.260 --> 50:56.845
All organic, right?

50:56.887 --> 50:58.930
What's that supposedto mean?

50:58.930 --> 51:02.100
Just curious if it's stillan organic bakery.

51:02.100 --> 51:06.021
I heard that you've been lookinginto me.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.273
You better stay outof my business, Red.

51:08.273 --> 51:11.109
Word is, Sugar heardabout your choice ingredients

51:11.109 --> 51:13.111
and threatened to expose you.

51:13.153 --> 51:15.614
Sugar was a horrible person.

51:15.655 --> 51:17.657
Is that what you were talkingto her about on the trail

51:17.699 --> 51:19.659
the morning Sugar died?

51:19.701 --> 51:24.956
I wouldn't blame youif you got mad.

51:24.956 --> 51:28.293
Saw the mud on your shoes,just a guess.

51:28.335 --> 51:31.129
Look what you made me do.

51:31.129 --> 51:32.798
[door bells jingle]

51:32.798 --> 51:34.466
Ruby? You there?

51:34.508 --> 51:36.259
Yeah, in the kitchen.

51:38.678 --> 51:39.304
Where'd she go?

51:39.346 --> 51:41.223
She went that way.

51:46.311 --> 51:47.979
[camera shutter snaps]

51:51.608 --> 51:53.401
Marian Rabbel, Ineed you to stop.

51:53.443 --> 51:55.695
No, leave me alone.

51:55.737 --> 51:56.988
Detective Killian.

51:57.030 --> 51:58.698
Homicide.

51:58.740 --> 52:00.867
I need to ask you a couple ofquestions down at the station.

52:00.909 --> 52:02.577
Why? I've done nothing wrong.

52:02.619 --> 52:05.497
Well then, you have nothingto worry about.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.416
Fine, but I haveto lock up first.

52:18.176 --> 52:19.344
Good thing I was hereto rescue you,

52:19.386 --> 52:21.137
could've had a dough-ingon our hands.

52:21.179 --> 52:22.013
[laughs]

52:22.055 --> 52:23.181
Is that the bestyou can do?

52:23.181 --> 52:24.182
"A dough-ing?"

52:24.182 --> 52:25.851
And this damselwas not in distress,

52:25.892 --> 52:27.018
I had it covered.

52:27.060 --> 52:30.105
Well, I'm uh, taking her into question her.

52:30.146 --> 52:31.648
Good. And I think I shouldbe there.

52:31.690 --> 52:32.732
You spooked the suspect,

52:32.774 --> 52:34.609
she might not give usanything anymore.

52:34.651 --> 52:36.403
And I gotta spend the nightwith the cookie lady,

52:36.444 --> 52:38.363
and not at my poker gamewhere I should be.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.365
Well, I wouldn't want a goodlead to get in the way

52:40.407 --> 52:41.658
of your full house.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.660
You do realize I should bewith my sister right now,

52:43.702 --> 52:45.370
who's getting married.

52:45.370 --> 52:46.329
What's stopping you?

52:46.371 --> 52:48.373
Justice.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.125
Listen, I talked to Marian'sbusiness partner.

52:50.166 --> 52:52.127
You're gonna want to hearwhat she had to say.

52:52.168 --> 52:52.878
Okay.

52:52.919 --> 52:56.464
And look what I just got.

52:57.757 --> 53:02.888
Tommy told you aboutthe footprint on the body, huh?

53:02.929 --> 53:07.809
All right, at the station,you need to be quiet,

53:07.851 --> 53:09.728
like a ghost, okay?

53:09.769 --> 53:11.479
Got it.

53:11.771 --> 53:14.774
[sirens wail]

53:28.330 --> 53:29.080
Hey.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.040
Ready?

53:30.081 --> 53:31.082
Yeah.

53:31.082 --> 53:32.709
So, uh, I got her inthe interrogation room,

53:32.751 --> 53:34.586
I'm just aboutto interview her.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.545
But you can't come.

53:35.587 --> 53:37.088
[exasperated]Of course.

53:37.088 --> 53:38.256
Okay?

53:38.256 --> 53:41.468
Oh, and make sure you ask herabout Sugar's threats.

53:41.509 --> 53:43.428
All right, I will.

53:43.470 --> 53:44.262
Stay here.

53:44.304 --> 53:45.055
Got it.

53:45.096 --> 53:47.182
Okay.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.683
[sighs]

53:55.273 --> 53:57.317
So where were you the morningSugar died?

53:57.359 --> 54:00.737
I was at the hotel forthe baking conference.

54:35.146 --> 54:36.481
Sugar wouldn't take any of my calls,

54:36.523 --> 54:39.526
so I had to wait for the chanceto be alone with her.

54:39.567 --> 54:41.820
I got up real early 'causeI know she likes

54:41.820 --> 54:44.197
to watch the sun rise when she's at the resort.

54:44.239 --> 54:47.659
This was about Sugar's threats?

54:47.659 --> 54:49.869
That reporter ladyhas a big mouth.

54:49.911 --> 54:52.664
I planned on telling Sugar  that I was dropping the lawsuit

54:52.706 --> 54:54.082
and selling the bakery.

54:54.124 --> 54:56.293
I figured I could keepmy reputation intact

54:56.334 --> 54:59.587
if she'd back offon exposing me.

54:59.629 --> 55:00.964
Did you find her that morning?

55:01.006 --> 55:02.590
Yes, by the trailhead.

55:02.632 --> 55:04.467
She wouldn't hear me out,though.

55:04.509 --> 55:08.722
Said she was meeting someone togo hiking and didn't have time.

55:08.763 --> 55:10.306
Did anyone see you together?

55:10.348 --> 55:13.685
I don't know, but you haveto believe me.

55:13.727 --> 55:17.564
The only thing sweet aboutthat woman was her fake name.

55:17.605 --> 55:18.857
But I didn't kill her.

55:18.898 --> 55:20.525
Then why'd you run awayfrom me at the bakery?

55:20.567 --> 55:23.486
Red was making me feellike a suspect.

55:23.528 --> 55:26.364
Thought you might be a cop.

55:26.364 --> 55:27.824
Could I please getsome water?

55:27.866 --> 55:30.535
It is hot in here.

55:30.577 --> 55:32.037
Sure.

55:32.037 --> 55:33.913
Be right back.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.176
Caught a glimpse.

55:46.217 --> 55:47.177
Yeah.

55:47.218 --> 55:49.471
I'm starting to wonderif she's innocent.

55:49.512 --> 55:51.306
I'm starting to wonderif she's guilty.

55:51.347 --> 55:54.809
She has motive, her businessreputation are at stake,

55:54.851 --> 55:56.561
and she was with Sugarthat morning.

55:56.561 --> 55:58.063
Yeah, but you saw her limpback at the bakery.

55:58.104 --> 56:00.190
How could she chase Sugardown and drown her?

56:00.231 --> 56:03.234
Hmm, people want someone dead,they find a way.

56:03.234 --> 56:04.986
[phone beeps]

56:07.822 --> 56:11.242
(Both) Oh, it's Tommy.

56:11.284 --> 56:13.870
So, what are you gonna dowith her?

56:13.912 --> 56:14.746
Uh, keep her in there.

56:14.746 --> 56:16.998
Let her, uh,bake a little.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.751
Hmm, I would hate to beon your bad side.

56:19.751 --> 56:22.378
Who says you're not already?

56:26.841 --> 56:28.510
Tommy.

56:28.551 --> 56:29.886
Shouldn't you bewith Charlotte?

56:29.928 --> 56:31.387
The wedding's in three days.

56:31.429 --> 56:33.473
I'm taking her for drinks laterwith the bridal party.

56:33.515 --> 56:34.933
So, what'd you find?

56:34.974 --> 56:37.102
Well, pending a coupletoxicology reports,

56:37.102 --> 56:38.645
the autopsy's done.

56:38.686 --> 56:40.313
(Both) And?

56:40.355 --> 56:41.648
What's with you guys?

56:41.689 --> 56:44.943
After excluding all othermanners of death,

56:44.984 --> 56:50.448
it's my official ruling thatSugar or Verna Albert, drowned.

56:50.448 --> 56:51.449
No surprise there.

56:51.491 --> 56:52.784
Yes, but I foundsome other things

56:52.784 --> 56:56.079
that are quite intriguing.

56:57.455 --> 57:00.333
The vic had a high level ofdiphenhydramine in her system.

57:00.375 --> 57:01.459
What is that?

57:01.459 --> 57:02.877
Sleeping pills.

57:02.919 --> 57:04.170
Oh, that's odd.

57:04.212 --> 57:06.965
She said she sleeps like a babyin the fresh mountain air.

57:06.965 --> 57:08.133
Well, it's odd, all right.

57:08.174 --> 57:10.176
She had double the recommendeddosage.

57:10.218 --> 57:12.679
Not to mention, the levelnever should have been

57:12.720 --> 57:15.265
that high first thingin the morning.

57:15.306 --> 57:17.267
Can you tell whenthe drug was ingested?

57:17.308 --> 57:19.102
I can't pinpoint it,but given the high level

57:19.144 --> 57:21.938
and the fact that she was stillable to hike on a mountain,

57:21.980 --> 57:25.984
best guess... within an hourbefore she died.

57:25.984 --> 57:27.527
Maybe the killer put itin her breakfast.

57:27.569 --> 57:31.114
Or in her water bottle, soshe'd be groggy for the hike.

57:31.156 --> 57:33.491
It would make it easier to drownher that way.

57:33.533 --> 57:34.659
Exactly.

57:34.659 --> 57:35.535
Hmm.

57:35.577 --> 57:36.661
How about the bruisingon her back,

57:36.661 --> 57:38.872
you said it looked likea shoe print.

57:38.913 --> 57:40.165
Any idea what kind of shoe?

57:40.165 --> 57:42.500
Given the tread markings,probably a running shoe.

57:42.542 --> 57:46.504
Remember, Marian had mud onher tennis shoe that morning.

57:46.504 --> 57:48.131
Yeah, still could've been Sam,though.

57:48.173 --> 57:50.133
It's a clue to be sure, butI have an even bigger one.

57:50.175 --> 57:52.510
I found skin cellsunder her fingernail.

57:52.510 --> 57:54.387
I sent a sample to the lab.

57:54.429 --> 57:57.807
Turns out it's not Sugar's DNA.

57:57.849 --> 57:58.850
Hmm.

57:58.892 --> 58:01.352
We get a match and we mighthave our killer.

58:01.352 --> 58:02.729
It's a good thing,

58:02.770 --> 58:06.816
'cause I'm listing SugarAlbert's manner of deathas homicide.

58:08.485 --> 58:10.069
[sighs]

58:11.237 --> 58:12.655
So, what do we do next?

58:12.697 --> 58:16.326
Well now, the police, as in me,continue to investigate.

58:16.367 --> 58:18.995
We need DNA samples fromeveryone involved in this case.

58:19.037 --> 58:21.080
Do you think they'll give themto you willingly?

58:21.122 --> 58:22.582
Well, I hope so.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.334
Getting warrants is gonnabe tough.

58:24.375 --> 58:25.710
Someone dies on a quietmountain,

58:25.710 --> 58:28.546
you've got a circumstantial caseat best.

58:28.546 --> 58:29.839
Can I ask you for a favour?

58:29.881 --> 58:30.798
Sure.

58:30.840 --> 58:33.051
I really need you to holdthis story.

58:33.051 --> 58:34.928
The killer doesn't knowany of this,

58:34.969 --> 58:39.015
and remember, you get theexclusive when I make an arrest.

58:39.057 --> 58:40.808
I'm a vault.

58:40.850 --> 58:42.060
'Kay.

58:42.101 --> 58:44.687
Wait, aren't youforgetting something?

58:44.729 --> 58:45.730
What?

58:45.730 --> 58:48.149
Your suspect asked for water.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.235
(Both) DNA.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.073
Where was the water cooler,Portland?

58:55.073 --> 58:55.698
[laughs]

58:55.740 --> 58:57.951
Sorry. Police business.

58:57.992 --> 58:59.869
[clears throat]

59:03.957 --> 59:07.961
Well, you're free to go now,but, um, don't go far, okay?

59:08.002 --> 59:10.421
You're not going to interrogateme underneath the hot lights?

59:10.463 --> 59:11.422
[laughs]

59:11.422 --> 59:13.591
We'll save it for the cop show.

59:46.958 --> 59:48.501
Can you send this to the lab,please?

59:48.543 --> 59:50.420
Thank you.

59:50.461 --> 59:51.296
That was easy.

59:51.337 --> 59:52.380
Yeah, yeah.

59:52.422 --> 59:54.215
I wish I could say the samefor Sam Albert.

59:54.257 --> 59:55.800
He's not too happywith me right now.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.093
Well, maybe I could help.

59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.138
I could pay him a visit,try and get some of his DNA.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.640
No, I don't want you interferingwith a suspect

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.310
at a critical pointin the investigation.

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.686
Okay then.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:09.522
I have a date with my sister.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.927
Ellie Bluth.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.273
Ellie, did you for...

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:53.608
Hi.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.692
Hi Sam.

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.194
I'm Ruby Herring.

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:59.238
I wanted to come by and givemy condolences from the family.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.366
John and Bonnie's daughter.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.117
Yeah.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.243
Well, thank you.

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:05.745
That's very nice, thank you.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.498
You probably know I'm a reporterwith Channel 57.

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:09.832
Mmhmm.

01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:11.918
I wanted to highlight some ofSugar's business accomplishments

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:13.670
for a story I'm doing.

01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:17.465
You know, it's only beenthree days since she passed.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.133
I... I don't think I'm readyfor that right now.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:21.969
Wait, please, it'll only takea minute.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:24.847
Sugar really meant a lotto my mom.

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:28.726
I want to learn moreabout her legacy.

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:30.812
Come in.

01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:38.236
You know what, um,could I grab a water?

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:39.987
I'm just thirstyall of a sudden.

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.781
Sure.

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:45.076
Beautiful flowers, thank you.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.702
Of course.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.177
There you are.

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:03.761
Thanks.

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:04.595
You're welcome.

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:05.555
So, tell me.

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:07.432
What do you wantto know about Sugar?

01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:10.726
Excuse me, could I use yourladies' room really quick?

01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:15.064
Sure, uh, it's just, uh,down the hall on the right.

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:15.773
Okay, got it.

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:16.983
Thanks.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:38.463
Hmm.

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:40.757
He'd probably miss this.

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:48.264
This I can work with.

01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:59.692
Ruby, is everything okay?

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.990
You know what, I completelylost track of time.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:09.327
I forgot I have an appointmentthat I'm going to be late for.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:10.912
Could I come back another time?

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.413
Sure.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.498
That'd be great, thanks.

01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:15.124
Okay.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.964
Can I ask you a personalquestion?

01:03:22.006 --> 01:03:24.884
Well, I guess it dependswhat it is.

01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:28.262
Are you in a relationshipwith Ellie Bluth?

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.723
You weren't kiddingabout personal, were ya?

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:34.727
Look, my marriage to Sugar endeda long time ago.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:38.815
The romantic side.

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:40.024
Ellie and I are old friends,

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:41.400
we were discussing what to do

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:45.571
about a critical and privatebusiness decision that morning

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:46.822
in the suite.

01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:50.243
So, you called off the divorcebecause of business.

01:03:50.284 --> 01:03:53.955
Yes.

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.456
You should tellthe police that.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.290
[laughs]

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.625
No.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.545
That'd only make things worse,give them an even bigger motive.

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:02.880
I mean, you just, you watchthose crime shows,

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.550
the husband's always guilty.

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:08.427
I really am sorry about Sugar.

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:10.012
Thank you.

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:11.556
[sighs]

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.072
[gasps]

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:30.241
Oh, my goodness! You scared mehalf to death.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.660
What did you not understandabout not coming here?

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:37.331
What, I'm not allowed to paycondolences to my mom's friend?

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.333
And how'd you know I was here,anyway?

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:42.086
Well, apparently, my guy'sa fan of yours.

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:43.421
Oh.

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:45.172
Well, next time I'll be sureto wear a hat and dark glasses.

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.925
Speaking of, did you knowthat Sam wears glasses?

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.136
All right, well,since you're here,

01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:51.596
did you find anything else?

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:52.346
Yep.

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.640
Just call me Nancy Drew.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:56.309
Bet you didn't knowshe was a redhead.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:58.311
More like a strawberry blonde.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:00.730
You read Nancy Drew too,didn't you?

01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:04.650
I will neither confirm nor denythat I read Nancy Drew.

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:06.360
This is from his hairbrush,

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:09.864
and this might haveEllie's DNA on it.

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:11.782
Hmm.

01:05:13.117 --> 01:05:16.120
Well, these are bothinadmissible in court,

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:18.247
and I could get in trouble if,uh,

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.708
my chief thinks I asked youto do this.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.293
Yeah, but you didn't.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:23.628
You have to use it.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:26.130
At the very least to helpexclude or include Ellie and Sam

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.465
as suspects.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:30.968
All right. I'll put a rushon it.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:34.764
And, um, nice work.

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:36.098
Really?

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.559
Really.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:39.894
Thank you.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:44.190
I have to... go,I um, to meet

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:46.901
with the cake bakerand the caterer,

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.736
there's a whole listof things...

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.906
that I have to get done.

01:05:54.575 --> 01:05:59.747
Oh, I know Sugar would've givenyou her stamp of approval.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.499
It's beautiful, Megan.

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.000
And thank you for doing this

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.587
under such difficultcircumstances.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.548
You know what,it's my pleasure.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:12.885
I never knew how therapeutic itwould be to make a wedding cake.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.554
Charlotte, let's go.

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:20.685
Would you mind if I asked youa couple questions about Sugar?

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:22.103
Anything to help.

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:23.354
Great.

01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:25.022
Did you know that Sam and Sugarcalled off their divorce

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.691
because of the business?

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:27.900
Yeah.

01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:29.068
You knew about that?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.403
He mentioned it.

01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:34.657
He also said something abouta "critical business decision"

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.951
the day that Sugar died?

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:39.370
He was probably talking aboutthe conglomerate

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:42.373
that wanted to buy Sugar and Samout for millions.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:43.249
Wow.

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:45.376
Sugar wanted to sellbut Sam didn't.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:46.085
Really.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:47.878
Well, did she convince him?

01:06:47.878 --> 01:06:49.547
She didn't have to.

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:52.425
Sugar owned 51 percentof the company.

01:06:52.466 --> 01:06:54.135
Why didn't he want to sell?

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.720
I mean, that's a lot of money.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.138
He loved running the company,

01:06:57.179 --> 01:07:00.099
and he didn't really want abunch of strangers stepping in.

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:01.600
Besides, he thoughtif he held out,

01:07:01.642 --> 01:07:04.103
he might take the businessto new heights.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:07.773
What's gonna happenin the business now?

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:12.695
I... I haven't really foundthe right moment to ask, um.

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:15.906
Sam's been planning the funeralall week, so...

01:07:15.948 --> 01:07:17.032
I'm sorry.

01:07:17.074 --> 01:07:20.411
Ruby. Are they gonna catchwhoever did this?

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.830
I wish I had the answers.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.340
We've gone really far, I thinkwe should turn back.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.509
Not yet.

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.969
You've been really distracted,Ruby.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.180
What's going on?

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.473
Well, I didn't wantto say anything,

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:41.932
since we're supposedto be relaxing,

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:44.685
but I'm looking for Sugar'swater bottle.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.271
Tommy found sleeping pillsin her system,

01:07:47.271 --> 01:07:49.190
we think she might'vebeen drugged.

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.024
Really?

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:51.275
Yeah.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:55.070
The map says that the creek goesabout another three miles.

01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:58.199
Three miles.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.241
[sighs]

01:07:59.283 --> 01:08:01.952
If you think it'll help.

01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:04.580
You're the best.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.085
I guess we should head back.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:11.629
It's probably long gone.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:12.797
Sorry.

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:14.632
It's okay.

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:16.425
Hey, what is that?

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:18.010
Can you hold this?

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:35.569
[gasps]

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:36.403
Oh, my goodness, Ruby.

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:38.697
You found it.

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:40.991
Yeah, maybe.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.167
Jake?

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.962
What are you doing here?

01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:54.462
Yeah, I just came to takea second look,

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:55.840
see if I missed anything.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.006
You too, huh?

01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:58.801
Oh, I don't thinkyou've formally met my sister.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:00.344
This is Charlotte.

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:01.136
Hi.

01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:02.263
Congratulationson your wedding.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.389
Thank you.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.224
There's a lot to do.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:06.934
I'm gonna head backto the hotel,

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.435
um, are you okay here?

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.354
Yeah. I'll be right behind you.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:10.979
Okay.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:11.856
Nice to meet you.

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:13.774
You too.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:18.028
I found this a couple milesdown the creek.

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:19.697
I think maybe the currentcould've carried it.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.823
Could be Sugar's.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:22.783
Well, thanks.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.703
I'll, uh, I'll getit checked out.

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:27.496
Find anythingwith the DNA test?

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:29.122
No, no, not yet.

01:09:29.163 --> 01:09:31.167
What about the eyeglass lens?

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:34.211
It turns out that's for someonewho's nearsighted.

01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:36.462
Beyond that,couldn't tell us much.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.464
Hmm.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.049
[phone rings]

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.259
Sorry.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:45.890
Uh, it's the lab.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:47.308
Yeah, it's Killian.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.310
Uh-huh.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:50.394
Got it.

01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:52.770
All right, thanks for puttinga rush on it.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:55.024
So?

01:09:55.065 --> 01:09:57.193
I can't tell you, Ruby.

01:09:57.234 --> 01:09:58.319
Was it Sam?

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:58.986
No.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.113
Marian?

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:02.072
[clears throat]

01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:04.366
Oh my gosh, it was Marian,wasn't it?

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:05.284
Look, Ruby.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:06.702
I appreciate everythingyou've done,

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:10.748
but your Nancy Drewmoment ends here.

01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:13.500
Uh, whatever you think you know,just...

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:17.338
just put a lid on it untilI can bring her in, okay?

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:24.178
[bushes rustle]

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:27.264
Hello?

01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:29.266
Hello, who's there?

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:42.821
Derek!

01:10:42.863 --> 01:10:43.989
You scared me.

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:48.452
Don't look so surprised.Believe it or not, I hike.

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:51.121
So, how's the investigationgoing?

01:10:51.121 --> 01:10:53.499
I'm not really workingon it anymore.

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.833
Hmm.

01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:57.419
It's hard to believe that Sugarmet her demise on this mountain.

01:10:57.461 --> 01:10:59.463
Yeah.

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:00.965
Well, better catch upwith my sister,

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:02.925
she's waiting for me.

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:03.842
Bye.

01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:05.261
Bye.

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:12.393
We don't need to be playinggames here, Ms. Rabbel.

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:17.940
How do you explain your DNAunder her fingernail?

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:19.692
I tracked down a hiker,

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:23.779
a witness who saw you threatenSugar the morning she died.

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.572
It's not what you think.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:28.367
When I saw Sugar that morning,she tried to get away.

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.869
I... I blocked her.

01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:33.706
She stumbled and she grabbedmy arm for balance.

01:11:33.747 --> 01:11:35.207
Her nail cut my skin.

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:38.002
I still have the scratch, see?

01:11:38.043 --> 01:11:41.046
But she stumbled,and I fell with her.

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:44.300
I inflamed an old knee injury.

01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:46.343
There was a running shoe imprinton her back,

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:48.512
size 9.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:51.265
If I'm not mistaken,you're a size 9?

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:53.517
Yeah, me and millionsof other people.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:59.231
You have motive, opportunityand means.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:00.566
In light of the new evidence,

01:12:00.607 --> 01:12:02.526
I'm placing youunder arrest for murder.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:03.360
What?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.903
Cuff her.

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:07.573
[clears throat]

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.366
Can I take my apron off?

01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:11.368
No.

01:12:11.368 --> 01:12:13.120
I love that colour.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.544
[phone rings]

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:23.714
Hmm, it's Ange.It'll be quick, okay.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.132
'Kay.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.929
Hi Ange, what's up?

01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:35.309
I just heard from a source at PDthat Marian Rabbel was arrested.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.061
I can't keep this from Frank.

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:39.688
Can't keep whatfrom Frank?

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:43.692
Marian Rabbel was arrestedfor Sugar Albert's murder.

01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.402
They have her DNA.

01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:46.570
Ruby?

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:49.073
I promised Jake I wouldn't sayanything about the DNA.

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:51.700
I can't believe he didn'ttell me she was arrested...

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.911
Oh, so it's Jake now.

01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:57.289
Are you still a reporter,or this Jake guy's new bestie?

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.540
I don't think Marian did it,

01:12:58.582 --> 01:13:01.043
that woman is a straight shooterif I ever saw one.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:06.048
Yeah, well, DNA doesn't lie.

01:13:07.841 --> 01:13:10.427
Sorry, I'll call you tomorrow.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.640
[sighs]

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:18.310
Well, that is a new recordfor the shortest career

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.562
in crime reporting ever.

01:13:20.604 --> 01:13:22.272
At least someone'sbeen arrested.

01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:24.441
Yeah, the wrong person.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.652
You know what, I don't wantto talk about the case anymore,

01:13:26.693 --> 01:13:28.946
I want to focus on you.

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:31.573
I have a surprise.

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:35.786
Oh, this is so sweet.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.662
[laughs]

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:40.082
Look at you in front ofthe camera.

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:42.709
I was always so enviousthat you knew what you wanted

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.920
at such a young age.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:47.881
You wanted to bea ballet dancer.

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.925
That was a kid's dream.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:53.595
I ended up an accountant,played it safe.

01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:56.056
But you also wanted to be a wifeand a mom,

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.891
and you're embarking on thatjourney right here

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:59.977
and right now.

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:03.480
I'm jealous you have yourpersonal life all figured out.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:08.318
We're two halves,always have been.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.987
I love you, Ruby.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:11.864
I love you more.

01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:14.324
I'm so rigging the bouquet toss.

01:14:14.324 --> 01:14:15.659
You're so bad.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.077
[laughs]

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.662
[sighs happily]

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:19.955
Is that Sugar?

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:25.669
Yeah, those are her selfiesshe took at Sunrise Point.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.838
Wait, do you see that?

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.177
That speck in Sugar's glasses.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.179
Looks like shoes.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:37.431
Looks like pink running shoes.

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:41.268
She wasn't alone on that hill.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.353
I... I need to find Dad.

01:14:43.353 --> 01:14:44.730
Wow!

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:47.107
Did you talk to the detective about this?

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.194
He said my armchair sleuthingdays are over.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.278
Pfft.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.779
Just when I thought we werein this together,

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:55.699
he got pretty arrogant.

01:14:55.699 --> 01:14:59.661
Well, detectives, they carrya lot of baggage.

01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:01.455
But I think you shouldcall him.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.040
Show him what you found.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.211
But, I am afraid you're goingto have to let this go.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:09.880
See you at dinner tonight,okay?

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:10.547
Thanks.

01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:12.090
Love you.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:18.472
[phone rings]

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.306
[sighs]

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.182
Killian.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.726
Detective, I need to talkto you.

01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:23.769
I guess you heard.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.354
We got our arrest.

01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:28.398
As promised, the interview'syours if you want it.

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:30.734
Yeah, about that...

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.028
Oh, please don't second-guessthis.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.030
You've got the wrong person.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:35.822
[sighs]

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.032
Marian makes sense.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:39.785
The DA agrees, he reviewedall the evidence,

01:15:39.826 --> 01:15:41.912
he wants to move forwardwith the murder charges.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.288
Okay, just hear me out.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:46.416
Take a look at the second selfe Sugar took.

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.418
Do you see the reflection in the photo?

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.254
Those are pink running shoes.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:51.380
Yeah, and?

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:54.258
And Marian was wearingwhite running shoes.

01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:56.885
Derek, the hotel managerwas wearing pink running shoes

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:58.262
when I saw him today.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:00.514
Oh, well he does lookkiller in pink.

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:02.266
No, I'm being serious.

01:16:02.307 --> 01:16:03.100
[sighs]

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:05.102
Well, case closed, then.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:06.812
Look, Ruby.

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:08.647
Maybe the person in pinkwas just a hiker

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:11.483
who was there when Sugar wastaking the picture, you know?

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:12.609
It's a popular spot.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.152
I'm sorry, I'm not buying it.

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:16.905
Did you notice that Marian wearsreading glasses?

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:19.574
The lens in the dirt belongsto somebody who's nearsighted.

01:16:19.616 --> 01:16:21.994
When I was looking atsurveillance videos with Derek,

01:16:22.035 --> 01:16:23.453
he took his glasses off.

01:16:23.453 --> 01:16:24.788
He's nearsighted.

01:16:24.788 --> 01:16:26.873
We don't even know if the lensbelonged to the killer.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.083
Did you test the water bottle?

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.960
Did it have diphenhydraminein it?

01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:31.044
[sighs]

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.713
Look, the water bottlewas found miles away

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:33.714
from the crime scene.

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.340
It could... it could beanybody's.

01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:36.842
But you need to test it.

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:37.801
Look, Ruby.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:41.013
I... I got paperwork to finish.Okay?

01:16:41.054 --> 01:16:42.139
Enjoy the wedding.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.682
[sighs]

01:16:52.232 --> 01:16:53.275
Hey Ruby.

01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:54.026
Hey, Megan.

01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:55.777
Big day tomorrow, exciting.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:56.862
Yeah.

01:16:56.903 --> 01:16:57.988
You know, you should really trythat steam room,

01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:59.448
it's so relaxingbefore all the mayhem.

01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:00.949
Oh, I was just aboutto do a workout,

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:03.160
but maybe I'll go after.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.745
I didn't knowyou wore glasses.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:07.331
Only when my contactsare bugging me.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.833
So, uh, what's next for you?

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:12.294
Actually, I have somegood news.

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:13.170
Really?

01:17:13.211 --> 01:17:15.339
Sam decided not to sellthe company,

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.342
and he promoted me tovice-president after all.

01:17:18.383 --> 01:17:20.427
Oh wow, that's wonderful.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:25.182
I know.

01:17:25.223 --> 01:17:26.641
Do you like yourfitness tracker?

01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:27.934
Cause I have the same one.

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.353
I can't live without it.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:33.649
10,000 steps a day, minimum.

01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:46.953
[to herself] Same water bottle,pink running shoes...

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.125
Do you use the heart ratefunction?

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.169
Sure do.

01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:59.591
160 beats a minute, and I know I'm getting a solid workout.

01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:02.677
[exhales]

01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:06.807
Okay, well, see you later.

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:07.557
Yeah.

01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:08.141
Bye Ruby.

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.102
Bye.

01:18:16.441 --> 01:18:17.484
Did you watch the report

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.777
I did the other dayon fitness trackers?

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:20.570
Oh Ruby, we nevermiss your segments.

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:21.655
Well, this is Megan's tracker.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:22.781
I swapped hers with mine.

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:24.408
Oh yeah, good thinking.

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:25.742
Now we can see what wasreally going on

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:27.994
with Megan on the trailthe morning Sugar died.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.996
Might tell us if somethinggot her heart rate up.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.039
Like murder.

01:18:31.081 --> 01:18:32.207
Very clever.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:35.335
Okay, so Megan saidthat she found Sugar at 7:00

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:39.214
on Tuesday morning.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:42.426
Look at the patternof Megan's heart rate.

01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:46.179
At 6:30 AM it spikesto 160 beats per minute,

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:50.225
and at 6:40 it dropsto 60 beats per minute,

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:53.145
and that lasts for 20 minutesuntil 7:00,

01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:55.105
when her pulse shoots back upto 160,

01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:57.357
the time that she claimedshe tried to save Sugar.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.109
Wait, I don't understandone bit of this.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:01.653
Well, Megan said that shewas walking back to the hotel.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.947
If that's true, then whywould her heart rate spike

01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:06.783
and then drop for 20 minutes,and then spike again.

01:19:06.783 --> 01:19:09.119
Well, if she hadjust committed murder,

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.288
wouldn't her heart continueto race?

01:19:11.329 --> 01:19:13.123
Yeah, but this was premeditated.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:14.791
I mean, Megan knewwhat she was doing.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:15.709
What do you think, Dad?
