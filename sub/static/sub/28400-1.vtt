In those rooms, you have
cameras in the strangest places,

01:54.784 --> 01:57.719
cameras that are so
small you can't see them

01:57.721 --> 01:58.656
and you won't know.

02:12.536 --> 02:13.467
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:13.469 --> 02:15.269
we will shortly be landing.

02:15.271 --> 02:16.437
We'll have to get
all hand baggage

02:16.439 --> 02:18.175
stowed securely
beneath your seat.

02:19.141 --> 02:20.542
We would also ask now

02:20.544 --> 02:21.542
that all the electronic
equipment be switched off

02:21.544 --> 02:24.679
and properly and safely
stowed for our landing.

03:08.758 --> 03:09.823
You
know how with alcohol,

03:09.825 --> 03:11.292
some people say it's become

03:20.537 --> 03:23.804
The trouble with smoking marijuana
is that most users really

03:23.806 --> 03:26.374
do believe that after a
few marijuana cigarettes,

03:26.376 --> 03:27.809
they're better soldiers,

03:27.811 --> 03:30.345
believe they're sharper
and can shoot better.

03:30.347 --> 03:33.381
They also believe their
reactions are faster as well.

03:33.383 --> 03:35.215
They think it increases.

03:35.217 --> 03:37.685
They think it does all
kinds of great things.

03:37.687 --> 03:40.255
The trouble is that,
subjectively, the person feels

04:09.718 --> 04:11.518
Have a seat at
the bar, I'll be right with ya.

04:13.856 --> 04:14.856
Thank you.

04:14.858 --> 04:15.690
I'll let
him know you're here.

04:15.692 --> 04:16.493
Thanks.

04:40.283 --> 04:41.418
I'm workin'.

04:42.285 --> 04:43.287
You're closed.

04:47.456 --> 04:48.492
Give me 10 minutes.

04:51.795 --> 04:53.695
Sophia, come on.

04:53.697 --> 04:55.396
I just worked a double.

04:55.398 --> 04:56.764
I'm tired and I wanna go home.

04:56.766 --> 04:58.733
Let's just have a drink.

04:58.735 --> 05:00.468
The bar is closed.

05:00.470 --> 05:01.603
Then let's go somewhere else.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.370
You didn't just cross an ocean

05:03.372 --> 05:06.974
after how many whatever
years just to see me.

05:06.976 --> 05:09.310
I wanted to see
some of my friends.

05:09.312 --> 05:10.848
None
of your friends live here.

05:13.483 --> 05:14.649
I know why.

05:14.651 --> 05:15.586
Because of this.

05:17.721 --> 05:18.719
- That's...
- I wanna come.

05:18.721 --> 05:19.586
No.

05:19.588 --> 05:20.454
- Yeah.
- No.

05:20.456 --> 05:21.322
It's not your thing.

05:21.324 --> 05:22.423
It is my thing.

05:22.425 --> 05:23.890
Adapted by Aaron
Campbell, it's my thing.

05:23.892 --> 05:25.459
No, it's not your thing.

05:25.461 --> 05:26.563
You won't like it.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.205
Just cut the shit.

05:37.507 --> 05:38.740
What the fuck is going on?

05:38.742 --> 05:39.742
I need your help.

05:42.012 --> 05:43.344
With?

05:43.346 --> 05:44.512
What happened, is it dad?

05:44.514 --> 05:46.546
No, it's not dad, he's fine.

05:48.617 --> 05:49.719
I, uh,

05:53.490 --> 05:55.289
I started seeing someone.

05:55.291 --> 05:56.723
It wasn't serious,

05:56.725 --> 05:58.058
and it was never gonna
work out or anything.

05:58.060 --> 05:59.697
I mean, he's my teacher.

06:01.064 --> 06:02.930
I know, and he's married.

06:02.932 --> 06:04.899
And I didn't know
that part, okay.

06:04.901 --> 06:09.372
I cut it off, and then
he started to follow me.

06:10.839 --> 06:14.244
And then he, he
started to threaten me.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.550
And then he got physical.

06:21.617 --> 06:25.456
And Aaron, I'm really scared.

06:27.089 --> 06:28.691
Do you have a place to stay?

06:29.591 --> 06:30.827
I need to stay with you.

06:31.694 --> 06:32.926
No.

06:32.928 --> 06:34.394
- Aaron.
- No.

06:34.396 --> 06:36.397
I don't have any room.

06:36.399 --> 06:37.832
You don't have room for me?

06:37.834 --> 06:38.865
No.

06:38.867 --> 06:39.870
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

06:41.036 --> 06:42.370
Bad shit happens.

06:42.372 --> 06:44.738
But you can't just parachute in

06:44.740 --> 06:49.043
and expect people to just
drop their lives to attend to

06:49.045 --> 06:50.877
- whatever it is you're doing.
- Okay, okay.

06:50.879 --> 06:53.714
You know what,
I'll just book BNB.

06:53.716 --> 06:55.752
It'll be super simple.

06:56.952 --> 06:58.586
Is that a little easier for you?

06:58.588 --> 06:59.454
Lookit.

06:59.456 --> 07:00.324
Here we go.

07:02.759 --> 07:03.593
Ah, here we go.

07:06.795 --> 07:08.564
Okay, yeah, this
place looks cool.

07:15.904 --> 07:16.939
Ah, in like that.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.375
I'm sorry.

07:28.617 --> 07:30.450
We're gonna cross
paths at some point.

07:30.452 --> 07:31.754
I flew all the way here.

07:33.088 --> 07:34.021
Okay.

07:34.023 --> 07:35.725
Thank you for talkin' to me.

07:47.069 --> 07:47.937
Come on.

07:49.004 --> 07:49.872
Come on.

08:17.966 --> 08:18.836
Thank you.

09:24.734 --> 09:25.999
How are you?

09:26.001 --> 09:27.570
I'm good, how are you?

09:29.572 --> 09:30.704
I'm good.

09:30.706 --> 09:33.107
It's nice to see your face.

09:33.109 --> 09:35.609
What has been, like
not even 24 hours?

09:35.611 --> 09:36.710
Is that your brother's place?

09:36.712 --> 09:37.712
Where are you?

09:37.714 --> 09:39.213
No, I rented this place.

09:39.215 --> 09:41.114
Oh, nice.

09:41.116 --> 09:43.917
Lookit, they
left me wine, okay.

09:43.919 --> 09:46.152
You're doing okay?

09:46.154 --> 09:48.122
I thought you'd be
staying at your brother's.

09:48.124 --> 09:49.891
Yeah, you know,
we're gonna hang out.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.693
It's just, it's actually better
for me to have my own space.

09:52.695 --> 09:53.893
He just doesn't like surprises,

09:53.895 --> 09:57.531
and I think I shocked him
by just kind of coming home.

09:57.533 --> 10:00.868
Hey, listen, I handed
in your paper for you.

10:00.870 --> 10:02.069
Actually, Marco wasn't in.

10:02.071 --> 10:06.172
But he send me a text asking
if I knew where you were.

10:06.174 --> 10:07.407
Did you talk to him?

10:07.409 --> 10:09.209
- Did you tell him where I was?
- He's not getting any info

10:09.211 --> 10:10.978
- out of me, that piece of shit.
- Okay.

10:10.980 --> 10:13.748
Listen, I'm really
glad you're back home

10:13.750 --> 10:16.584
and you're taking a little
bit of time for yourself.

10:16.586 --> 10:18.018
Um.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.987
Yeah, thanks, thank you.

10:19.989 --> 10:21.622
I wish I could
be there with you,

10:21.624 --> 10:23.891
but I'm gonna be late for class.

10:23.893 --> 10:25.528
Yeah, yeah, you go.

10:26.929 --> 10:29.629
Um, thank you.

10:29.631 --> 10:31.331
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

10:31.333 --> 10:33.166
Bye.

14:06.982 --> 14:08.348
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, excuse me!

14:08.350 --> 14:09.483
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:09.485 --> 14:11.050
- Whoa, sorry.
- What are doing?

14:11.052 --> 14:12.887
I was, I was just
makin' a phone call.

14:12.889 --> 14:14.954
I didn't wanna disturb you,
I was tryin' to be quiet.

14:14.956 --> 14:16.857
Sorry, there's a fire
escape in the back.

14:16.859 --> 14:17.858
How did you get in here?

14:17.860 --> 14:20.127
I know, you're
Sophia Campbell?

14:20.129 --> 14:21.262
Yes.

14:21.264 --> 14:22.262
I'm Glen.

14:22.264 --> 14:23.229
Okay.

14:23.231 --> 14:24.565
This is, this is my place.

14:24.567 --> 14:26.199
Why are you in here?

14:26.201 --> 14:28.169
You chose shared space.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.502
I don't know what that means.

14:29.504 --> 14:32.272
Look at your
phone, the website.

14:32.274 --> 14:33.940
You chose shared,
that's all this is.

14:33.942 --> 14:35.575
I just would really
prefer if you left.

14:35.577 --> 14:36.810
Okay, I'm gonna go.

14:36.812 --> 14:38.212
- I'm just telling you...
- Yeah.

14:38.214 --> 14:39.879
What happened, okay, I'm
not creeping in on you.

14:39.881 --> 14:41.382
Everything's fine.

14:41.384 --> 14:43.983
Tomorrow, we'll find
you somethin' new, okay.

14:43.985 --> 14:44.888
Full refund.

14:46.288 --> 14:48.421
This is just a misunderstanding.

14:48.423 --> 14:50.190
This is just a mistake.

14:50.192 --> 14:51.825
Okay.

14:51.827 --> 14:54.862
If you need anything
else, you've got my number.

14:54.864 --> 14:56.262
Listen, I've got a
couple properties.

14:56.264 --> 14:58.265
- You can stay here tonight.
- I just need you to go.

14:58.267 --> 14:59.269
Goodnight.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.156
Sophia.

16:27.289 --> 16:30.324
Hey.

16:30.326 --> 16:32.392
Hey.

16:32.394 --> 16:34.395
I, uh, I didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

16:35.530 --> 16:37.064
I should have
given you a heads-up.

16:37.066 --> 16:38.165
I mean, I'm sorry I barged
in on you like that.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.599
I'm, I wasn't,

16:39.601 --> 16:42.236
I'm, like, really embarrassed.

16:42.238 --> 16:43.403
I was actually out
with a couple friends.

16:43.405 --> 16:45.908
So it's a little blurry.

16:48.177 --> 16:49.142
It's all good.

16:49.144 --> 16:49.977
Are you staying?

16:49.979 --> 16:51.145
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:51.147 --> 16:52.112
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, that's fine.

16:52.114 --> 16:53.046
- Okay.
- I mean,

16:53.048 --> 16:54.047
I've got other properties.

16:54.049 --> 16:55.181
Well, I mean, if there's
anything I can get ya,

16:55.183 --> 16:56.150
just, you know, send me a text.

16:56.152 --> 16:57.084
Okay.

16:57.086 --> 16:57.984
I will.

16:57.986 --> 16:58.651
Enjoy your day.

16:58.653 --> 16:59.520
You too.

16:59.522 --> 17:00.523
Okay, bye.

17:06.061 --> 17:06.930
Sophia?

17:09.432 --> 17:11.401
Do you wanna grab a
drink or somethin'?

17:12.335 --> 17:13.202
A drink?

17:14.170 --> 17:15.435
Right now?

17:15.438 --> 17:16.306
Yeah.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.638
Are you, like,
sweaty, or,

17:18.641 --> 17:20.173
are you gonna wear that?

17:20.175 --> 17:21.709
Yeah, a drink for you, sure.

17:21.711 --> 17:24.978
I'm almost done, and I still
kind of have a hangover.

17:24.980 --> 17:27.450
So a drink would be awesome.

17:29.317 --> 17:30.718
Um, yeah.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.186
Okay.

17:32.188 --> 17:34.020
Just one and I pick the spot.

17:34.022 --> 17:34.690
Just one.

17:37.292 --> 17:38.160
Okay.

17:40.061 --> 17:41.228
So what're you doin'?

17:41.230 --> 17:42.464
I'm just
bummin' around.

17:43.398 --> 17:44.664
Bummin' around town.

17:44.666 --> 17:45.599
Yeah.

17:45.601 --> 17:46.767
This is your running spot?

17:46.769 --> 17:47.636
Yeah.

17:49.672 --> 17:50.603
So is this your go-to?

17:50.605 --> 17:52.338
My brother works here.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.407
Your brother works here?

17:53.409 --> 17:54.642
Yeah.

17:54.644 --> 17:57.210
He's off today, so you can
simmer right down.

17:57.212 --> 17:59.680
You said you're
visiting from somewhere?

17:59.682 --> 18:00.951
Yeah, Italy.

18:01.683 --> 18:02.882
Nice.

18:02.884 --> 18:05.753
Yeah, I'm in my second year
of culinary school there.

18:05.755 --> 18:08.421
Culinary school,
so, like a chef.

18:08.423 --> 18:09.757
Yeah.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.324
Not yet.

18:11.326 --> 18:12.526
To be.

18:12.528 --> 18:15.395
So you have properties,
you rent properties.

18:15.397 --> 18:16.332
That's your thing?

18:18.334 --> 18:19.201
Yes.

18:21.069 --> 18:23.504
Yeah, that's my thing.

18:23.506 --> 18:24.604
Yeah.

18:24.606 --> 18:27.607
You know, it's self-made
with a partner.

18:27.609 --> 18:28.776
But you know...

18:32.181 --> 18:34.148
I'm sorry, I gotta go out.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.449
Can I, I gotta check this.

18:35.451 --> 18:36.682
- Totally.
- I'm sorry.

18:36.684 --> 18:38.218
No, yeah, totally.

19:09.551 --> 19:10.551
Sorry.

19:10.553 --> 19:11.451
That's okay.

19:11.453 --> 19:12.419
Business.

19:12.421 --> 19:13.353
Everything's okay?

19:13.355 --> 19:14.587
Oh, yeah, everything's good.

19:14.589 --> 19:15.457
Cool.

19:19.561 --> 19:21.697
So do you take all
your renters on dates?

19:23.164 --> 19:27.433
You know, I don't, I
don't really do this a lot.

19:27.435 --> 19:32.307
Just, I've kinda got a thing
for pretty redheaded girls.

19:34.576 --> 19:35.441
Do you wanna eat?

19:35.443 --> 19:37.146
Should we eat something?

19:38.146 --> 19:40.613
I'm not, I'm not hungry.

19:40.615 --> 19:41.550
- Oh?
- No.

19:43.152 --> 19:44.485
Do you not eat on first dates.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.885
I don't.

19:45.887 --> 19:47.520
Anything else you
don't do on first dates?

19:47.522 --> 19:48.855
Um, I'm not gonna
sleep with you,

19:48.857 --> 19:50.224
if that's what you're asking.

19:50.226 --> 19:51.190
You're not gonna
sleep with me?

19:51.192 --> 19:51.991
I have a boyfriend

19:51.993 --> 19:52.860
- back home.
- You have a boyfriend?

19:52.862 --> 19:54.228
I do have one, yeah.

19:54.230 --> 19:55.698
Good, what's your
boyfriend's name?

19:56.798 --> 19:58.198
Ben.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.466
Italian Ben?

19:59.468 --> 20:01.401
- Italian Ben.
- Italian Ben, good.

20:01.403 --> 20:03.202
- Thank you.
- Nice.

20:03.204 --> 20:04.203
Would you
like somethin' to eat?

20:04.205 --> 20:05.607
No, yeah, that's fine, thanks.

20:06.608 --> 20:08.508
So do you have dinner plans?

20:08.510 --> 20:09.711
Yeah, with you, I hope.

20:11.579 --> 20:13.515
But not here again.

20:14.817 --> 20:15.748
Again?

20:15.750 --> 20:17.386
Yeah, you ate here last night.

20:18.753 --> 20:21.123
Um, I'm sorry.

20:23.159 --> 20:25.261
How do you know that
I ate here last night?

20:26.162 --> 20:27.760
- Relax.
- Relax?

20:27.762 --> 20:28.895
How do you know that

20:28.897 --> 20:30.363
- I ate here last night.
- I looked at your Instagram.

20:30.365 --> 20:31.667
You posted here last night.

20:32.867 --> 20:34.601
You creeped me?

20:34.603 --> 20:35.536
Of course I creeped you.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.437
You're staying at my place.

20:37.439 --> 20:38.939
Did you creep me?

20:38.941 --> 20:39.776
No.

20:41.576 --> 20:42.412
I bet I tried.

20:43.913 --> 20:45.145
Okay, I
couldn't find you.

20:45.147 --> 20:50.350
You're probably under some weird
alias, fuckin' Running Man.

20:50.352 --> 20:51.785
No, I mean, listen, I just,

20:51.787 --> 20:53.386
I wanted to check
out who you were.

20:53.388 --> 20:55.824
And you just happened
to be beautiful.

20:57.660 --> 21:00.526
Maybe I wanna see your
jacket on my bedroom floor.

21:00.528 --> 21:04.765
Wow.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.736
do you say that to
all your renters, too?

21:08.537 --> 21:10.737
Only the redheads.

22:09.464 --> 22:10.430
Last night I was asleep,

22:10.432 --> 22:11.664
when I started hearing
these weird noises.

22:11.666 --> 22:15.768
Out of nowhere, the owner of
this place barges in on me.

22:15.770 --> 22:18.537
I grab a pan, and
he's like, whoa, easy.

22:18.539 --> 22:19.972
Like, I'll give you a refund.

22:19.974 --> 22:20.907
Like, it's all good.

22:20.909 --> 22:22.412
And I'm like, get out of here.

22:23.345 --> 22:24.710
And then I'm shopping today,

22:24.712 --> 22:27.447
and he, like,
randomly runs by me.

22:27.449 --> 22:29.415
And then we ended
up going for a beer.

22:29.417 --> 22:32.952
Okay, that is
the most random story ever.

22:32.954 --> 22:33.921
I don't know, he's cute.

22:33.923 --> 22:37.724
And he's like, he's
funny, and I don't know.

22:37.726 --> 22:39.058
We kind of left it open-ended.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.559
Like, I think we're gonna
have dinner tonight.

22:40.561 --> 22:41.995
Go out, have fun.

22:41.997 --> 22:44.698
That's exactly what you're
supposed to be doing back home.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.632
That's why you're there.

22:46.634 --> 22:48.367
Call me tomorrow, let
me know how it goes.

22:48.369 --> 22:49.304
Bye, love you.

23:55.104 --> 23:56.469
Do you like movies?

23:56.471 --> 23:58.138
Yeah, sure, I like movies.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.575
Okay, what's your fave?

24:01.076 --> 24:03.008
Um, Casablanca.

24:03.010 --> 24:04.009
What?

24:04.011 --> 24:05.379
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

24:05.381 --> 24:06.846
I've never seen Casablanca.

24:11.619 --> 24:12.885
Have you seen Casablanca?

24:12.887 --> 24:13.987
- No.
- Yeah, you have.

24:15.958 --> 24:19.461
Um, I have this thing later.

24:21.163 --> 24:22.030
It's a play.

24:23.398 --> 24:24.733
The White Devil.

24:25.834 --> 24:27.570
Yeah, do you
wanna come with me?

24:28.537 --> 24:29.635
Tonight?

24:29.637 --> 24:31.738
Yeah, my brother wrote it.

24:31.740 --> 24:32.805
Your brother wrote this play?

24:32.807 --> 24:33.707
Yeah.

24:33.709 --> 24:35.475
Sure, yeah.

24:35.477 --> 24:36.410
Sounds frightening.

24:36.412 --> 24:37.846
A revenge tragedy.

24:39.147 --> 24:40.814
I've never been to a play.

24:40.816 --> 24:42.015
What?

24:42.017 --> 24:43.686
Yeah, you know,
it's a nice night.

24:44.952 --> 24:46.489
Why not get out?

24:47.655 --> 24:50.457
I found your little,
uh, your little stash.

24:50.459 --> 24:51.490
You did?

24:51.492 --> 24:52.825
Your little collection.

24:52.827 --> 24:54.760
Well, if you're so inclined,

24:54.762 --> 24:57.963
I happen to make a
fantastic cocktail.

24:57.965 --> 24:59.034
- Yes?
- One drink.

24:59.968 --> 25:01.535
And that's it.

25:01.537 --> 25:04.171
And then we go watch your
brother's stupid play.

25:04.173 --> 25:05.139
You don't have to go with me.

25:05.141 --> 25:06.472
- I have someone else lined up.
- Is this,

25:06.474 --> 25:07.540
no, you do not.

25:07.542 --> 25:08.410
I do.

25:17.051 --> 25:18.617
Hey, what's up, dude?

25:18.619 --> 25:20.389
Hey Kal,
what's goin' on?

25:38.240 --> 25:41.540
Are you
trying to get me drunk?

25:41.542 --> 25:42.411
Maybe.

25:43.545 --> 25:44.544
Whoo.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.998
I feel like, um, you're trouble.

26:07.001 --> 26:08.168
Cheers.

26:08.170 --> 26:09.105
Cheers.

26:13.075 --> 26:15.111
You don't even know me.

26:16.711 --> 26:18.748
I don't wanna know you.

26:20.249 --> 26:21.116
Hmm.

26:22.550 --> 26:23.749
Let's try harder.

26:45.707 --> 26:46.640
So what's this?

26:46.642 --> 26:48.074
- These are just like...
- They're just...

26:48.076 --> 26:50.009
Your pants too loose, or what?

26:50.011 --> 26:51.277
Well, I gotta hold
my pants up somehow.

26:51.279 --> 26:53.880
Yeah, I mean, what's a belt?

26:53.882 --> 26:55.015
It does?

26:55.017 --> 26:55.882
Go, do it.

26:55.884 --> 26:57.284
Ooh.

26:57.286 --> 26:58.884
Do the other one, balance
it out.

27:00.221 --> 27:01.321
It's like an instrument.

27:01.323 --> 27:02.492
It hit my nipple.

27:08.963 --> 27:10.196
This is a lovely dress.

27:10.198 --> 27:11.163
Thank you.

27:11.165 --> 27:13.165
You look good in white.

27:13.167 --> 27:15.168
It's your color.

27:15.170 --> 27:17.240
Is it a color?

27:19.007 --> 27:19.873
No.

27:42.263 --> 27:43.662
House is open.

27:43.664 --> 27:44.533
Okay.

27:51.740 --> 27:54.239
What mockery hath
death made of thee?

27:57.679 --> 27:58.548
Huh.

28:00.082 --> 28:02.084
My love, why have
you forsaken me?

28:05.953 --> 28:06.888
I miss you.

28:41.390 --> 28:46.596
Guilty men.

28:47.061 --> 28:48.063
So short a life.

29:09.884 --> 29:13.189
This is beyond melancholy.

29:16.724 --> 29:18.961
I dare my fate to do its worst.

29:20.127 --> 29:21.864
The pain has passed.

29:46.054 --> 29:47.857
Of all these horrors.

29:49.458 --> 29:50.326
At last,

29:53.795 --> 29:55.664
this terrible vision,

29:58.266 --> 30:02.337
I will drown my
weapon in their blood.

30:03.872 --> 30:07.143
With this, her bounty
shall turn to good.

30:37.838 --> 30:38.707
Thank you.

31:33.194 --> 31:35.527
You fucking loser.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.230
Glen?

33:57.404 --> 33:58.273
Hello?

34:09.516 --> 34:11.217
Hey, it's Sophia,
leave a message.

34:12.186 --> 34:13.686
Soph, I didn't
see you at the show.

34:13.688 --> 34:15.121
I'm goin' out for a drink.

34:15.123 --> 34:16.722
Hey, it's
Sophia, leave a message.

34:16.724 --> 34:19.757
Sophia, it's me.

34:19.760 --> 34:23.228
Call me as soon as you get this.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.340
Yeah.

35:07.342 --> 35:09.010
Martha, this is Aaron.

35:10.512 --> 35:12.311
Listen, I can't get
a hold of Sophia.

35:12.313 --> 35:15.718
And her phone is out of service.

35:16.717 --> 35:18.083
I can't leave a voicemail.

35:18.085 --> 35:20.253
She's not responding
to my texts.

35:20.255 --> 35:22.755
She was gonna come see this
play that I had goin' on,

35:22.757 --> 35:25.124
and she didn't show up.

35:25.126 --> 35:27.293
I just wanna know if
she's been in touch.

35:27.295 --> 35:28.597
I'm just worried about her.

35:38.572 --> 35:39.572
I got this.

35:39.574 --> 35:40.576
You got table eight?

35:44.144 --> 35:45.246
We need table six.

35:48.750 --> 35:49.617
Hang on.

36:06.501 --> 36:07.867
How's my table eight?

36:07.869 --> 36:09.101
Table eight, two minutes.

36:09.103 --> 36:10.302
Okay, good.

36:10.304 --> 36:12.505
Listen, Kev, I
gotta leave early.

36:12.507 --> 36:14.139
- Tonight?
- Yeah, is that okay?

36:14.141 --> 36:16.374
Yeah, I'm sure Steve
can cover for you.

36:16.376 --> 36:18.244
Yeah, my sister,
she's in town.

36:18.246 --> 36:20.112
And I can't get ahold of her.

36:20.114 --> 36:21.313
I don't know where she is.

36:21.315 --> 36:22.583
Your sister was
here yesterday.

36:24.518 --> 36:26.452
She was, Sophia
was here yesterday?

36:26.454 --> 36:27.452
She was here.

36:27.454 --> 36:29.121
She was sitting in the
front with some guy.

36:29.123 --> 36:31.124
Who was it, someone
regular or some random?

36:31.126 --> 36:33.729
Random guy, it looked
like they were on a date.

36:36.164 --> 36:37.496
Okay, all right, all right.

36:37.498 --> 36:38.565
So, you got this?

36:38.567 --> 36:39.865
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Thanks, buddy, you're a pal.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.434
All right.

36:41.436 --> 36:42.304
Thank you.

37:22.443 --> 37:23.441
How can I help you?

37:23.443 --> 37:25.744
Sorry, I'm
looking for somebody.

37:25.746 --> 37:26.581
Okay.

37:27.748 --> 37:29.414
I'm looking for
my sister, Sophia.

37:29.416 --> 37:30.883
She stayed in this house.

37:30.885 --> 37:34.720
She booked this place
last time I saw her and...

37:34.722 --> 37:36.222
Nobody was here
when we got here.

37:36.224 --> 37:36.889
Nobody was here?

37:36.891 --> 37:38.324
No.

37:38.326 --> 37:39.659
Are you are owner
of this house?

37:39.661 --> 37:41.293
No, no, we're renting.

37:41.295 --> 37:42.929
My wife rented
over the internet.

37:42.931 --> 37:44.329
Is there somethin' wrong?

37:44.331 --> 37:45.597
If you see her, can
you please tell her

37:45.599 --> 37:47.300
to call her brother,
if she comes back here

37:47.302 --> 37:48.534
- for any reason?
- It would be my pleasure.

37:48.536 --> 37:50.269
Sure.

37:50.271 --> 37:51.637
Wish I could help.

37:51.639 --> 37:52.508
Okay.

37:54.208 --> 37:55.273
Thank you.

37:55.275 --> 37:55.941
Okay.

39:19.327 --> 39:21.459
My sister, she's
gone missing, Sophia Campbell.

39:21.461 --> 39:22.561
And
you're her brother?

39:22.563 --> 39:23.561
Yes.

39:23.563 --> 39:24.929
And then
what's goin' on here?

39:24.931 --> 39:27.633
She just got off
a plane from Italy.

39:27.635 --> 39:31.604
And there was this
guy, some married guy.

39:31.606 --> 39:34.907
And he was stalking her, and
she wanted to stay at my place.

39:34.909 --> 39:36.608
I told her that she couldn't.

39:36.610 --> 39:39.545
And so she booked
an online rental.

39:39.547 --> 39:42.380
I went to the house, and
I can't find the owner.

39:42.382 --> 39:43.782
I can't track him down.

39:43.784 --> 39:45.050
And there's somebody
else renting there,

39:45.052 --> 39:47.385
and they haven't seen my sister.

39:47.387 --> 39:48.621
Does she have a
drinking problem,

39:48.623 --> 39:50.555
or does she do anything
stronger, harder?

39:50.557 --> 39:52.825
She's a partier, she's 25.

39:52.827 --> 39:53.829
That's what they do.

39:54.795 --> 39:57.429
There's something not
right about that place.

39:57.431 --> 39:58.930
I don't know what it is, but
there's something not right.

39:58.932 --> 40:00.900
Can you come with, why
don't we just go there?

40:00.902 --> 40:02.601
Relax,
you have to file this

40:02.603 --> 40:03.601
with the crime officer,

40:03.603 --> 40:05.403
who's gonna look into
this further, all right.

40:05.405 --> 40:07.740
We're gonna do our best
to find your sister.

41:35.096 --> 41:36.829
We're sorry,
you have reached a number

41:36.831 --> 41:38.130
that has been disconnected
or is no longer...

43:10.056 --> 43:12.992
I'm looking for
some kind of device

43:12.994 --> 43:16.996
that can detect cameras,
like hidden cameras.

43:16.998 --> 43:17.929
Do you have anything like that?

43:17.931 --> 43:19.033
Yeah, of course.

43:20.233 --> 43:21.101
Gimme a second.

43:29.744 --> 43:32.146
Frequency detector,
straight out of China.

43:33.648 --> 43:35.748
It'll detect any wireless
camera in short range.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.818
Looks like it has red
light scanning, too.

43:38.952 --> 43:40.653
Can you tell me
how this works?

45:48.748 --> 45:49.817
Oh, fuck you.

46:14.775 --> 46:16.909
Kal, listen, I'm sorry,
I need your help.

46:16.911 --> 46:18.776
Yeah, what's
goin' on, you all right?

46:18.778 --> 46:21.179
I'm in a house,
it's Sophia, she's missing.

46:21.181 --> 46:22.313
Your sister's missing?

46:22.315 --> 46:23.315
Yeah.

46:23.317 --> 46:24.450
Did she rent
the house you're in?

46:24.452 --> 46:25.450
Yes.

46:25.452 --> 46:28.454
Kal, there are cameras
all over this house,

46:28.456 --> 46:30.889
little pinhole
cameras everywhere,

46:30.891 --> 46:33.791
in the smoke alarm, in the
bedroom, in the bathroom.

46:33.793 --> 46:34.992
I'm in the basement,

46:34.994 --> 46:37.095
and I've found a network
connecting all these cameras.

46:37.097 --> 46:38.863
- It's looking right at me.
- Pinhole cameras?

46:38.865 --> 46:40.932
Yeah, I think they're
watching me right now.

46:40.934 --> 46:42.333
Wait, what the fuck?

46:42.335 --> 46:43.969
I had to tear the wall down.

46:43.971 --> 46:47.005
Somebody did not want
this to be found.

46:47.007 --> 46:47.940
Send me some pictures.

46:47.942 --> 46:49.208
I need to see the setup.

46:49.210 --> 46:51.209
Professionals did this.

46:52.213 --> 46:54.079
Can you grab
the IP address off it?

46:54.081 --> 46:55.046
Yeah.

46:55.048 --> 46:56.784
All right,
turn on the monitor.

46:58.052 --> 46:59.217
Is it on?

46:59.219 --> 47:00.821
- Yeah.
- Hit Command + Enter.

47:01.956 --> 47:03.387
You'll see the
DOS window pop up.

47:03.389 --> 47:05.090
Type in ipconfig.

47:07.427 --> 47:09.061
You get it?

47:09.063 --> 47:10.229
Just got it.

47:10.231 --> 47:11.164
Can you access any files?

47:11.166 --> 47:14.369
The home
screen says ZIPPER HOLE.

47:15.402 --> 47:16.367
ZIPPER HOLE?

47:16.369 --> 47:18.503
PROPERTY 003, Online.

47:18.505 --> 47:21.874
I got a guy who sells
fake IDs on the dark web.

47:21.876 --> 47:22.541
Let me talk to him.

47:22.543 --> 47:23.508
Okay.

47:23.510 --> 47:24.476
Call you soon.

49:19.626 --> 49:20.494
Problem?

49:51.592 --> 49:53.994
What the fuck did you do?

49:59.432 --> 50:01.402
I don't understand,
why is he there?

50:10.411 --> 50:11.246
Calm down?

50:12.679 --> 50:15.646
Listen, I'm your
front man, okay.

50:15.648 --> 50:18.085
I book the guests,
and that's it.

50:30.731 --> 50:32.533
What did you do to her?

50:34.367 --> 50:35.302
Did you hurt her?

50:38.338 --> 50:39.306
Stay low?

50:41.275 --> 50:42.110
What the fuck?

50:43.710 --> 50:44.578
Am I in danger?

50:46.413 --> 50:47.248
Police?

50:51.719 --> 50:54.586
Listen, man, you pay
me really well, okay.

50:54.588 --> 50:55.690
I appreciate that, but

50:57.690 --> 50:58.592
I don't wanna know.

51:00.027 --> 51:00.929
I don't with know.

52:08.262 --> 52:09.494
Shh.

52:10.664 --> 52:12.667
Look, man, this
took some time.

52:13.567 --> 52:15.066
There's a little, small sector

52:15.068 --> 52:17.802
of the deep web
called the dark web,

52:17.804 --> 52:19.403
where a lot of the drug rings,

52:19.405 --> 52:20.738
you know, like
human trafficking,

52:20.740 --> 52:22.409
all takes place on the dark web.

52:23.744 --> 52:26.411
You don't wanna be messing
with this shit, dude.

52:26.413 --> 52:27.345
So what, I mean...

52:27.347 --> 52:29.780
Look, I've already
called the cops.

52:29.782 --> 52:30.782
I mean, I took a peak,

52:30.784 --> 52:33.287
and it had some, like,
hidden camera shit that,

52:34.420 --> 52:36.521
I sent you an email with a link.

52:36.523 --> 52:38.123
Install the software,

52:38.125 --> 52:39.724
and then click on the link
I sent you in the email.

52:39.726 --> 52:41.126
You'll see for yourself.

53:17.463 --> 53:20.134
Look, man, we've known
each other a long time, so.

53:20.867 --> 53:22.266
Kal, wait.

53:22.268 --> 53:24.369
I really hope you
find your sister.

53:24.371 --> 53:25.670
I did all I could.

53:25.672 --> 53:27.572
This shit's way too sketchy.

55:12.980 --> 55:14.378
Oh, no.

58:55.068 --> 58:59.407
A lesson
on suturing an open wound.

59:01.041 --> 59:04.075
Hold the needle holder in the
palm of your dominant hand

59:04.077 --> 59:06.043
with your index finger extended.

59:06.045 --> 59:08.479
This position allows
for maximum control

59:08.481 --> 59:10.715
and proper angle of entry.

59:10.717 --> 59:12.650
You should insert the
needle into the skin

59:12.652 --> 59:15.720
at a 90-degree angle and
take a curvilinear path

59:15.722 --> 59:20.624
through the dermis and
subcutaneous tissues.

59:27.534 --> 59:29.833
By following these principles,
you will create sutures

59:29.835 --> 59:32.237
that follow a curvilinear
path through the tissue

59:32.239 --> 59:35.840
and result in inversion
of the wound edges.

59:38.878 --> 59:40.278
No steadfast rules exist

59:40.280 --> 59:42.579
regarding the number
of sutures required

59:42.581 --> 59:44.918
for a given length
of laceration.

59:47.653 --> 59:48.987
Instruct the patient
to keep the wound dry

59:48.989 --> 59:50.891
for 12 to 24 hours.

59:52.259 --> 59:54.291
Seek medical attention
as soon as possible

59:54.293 --> 59:58.833
to have the wound assessed
by a medical professional.

01:00:05.739 --> 01:00:08.509
Fuck.

01:04:43.048 --> 01:04:44.918
What the hell?

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:11.778
Life ruined all.

01:05:41.074 --> 01:05:42.209
Who are you?

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.215
I'm John Webster.

01:05:51.317 --> 01:05:52.318
Sophia's brother.

01:05:55.221 --> 01:05:56.423
Are you Sophia's brother?

01:05:58.358 --> 01:05:59.293
I was.

01:06:02.628 --> 01:06:03.496
Where is he?

01:06:05.597 --> 01:06:06.465
He's dead.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:11.070
I never touched her.

01:06:12.105 --> 01:06:12.972
Bullshit.

01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:16.043
I saw your site,

01:06:19.112 --> 01:06:19.980
ZIPPER HOLE.

01:06:21.246 --> 01:06:24.016
I found the cameras, all of 'em.

01:06:25.684 --> 01:06:26.920
I found your network.

01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:29.590
You watch people.

01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:33.393
You take away their privacy.

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:39.063
And you show it to perverts.

01:06:39.065 --> 01:06:41.097
- Did you get off on it?
- I'd provide the place,

01:06:41.099 --> 01:06:42.333
and that's it.

01:06:42.335 --> 01:06:43.266
That's not it.

01:06:43.268 --> 01:06:44.537
I'm not involved in this.

01:06:46.306 --> 01:06:47.405
You watched it, didn't you?

01:06:47.407 --> 01:06:48.275
No.

01:06:49.242 --> 01:06:51.510
You watched him put
his hands on her throat.

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:53.644
You watched her screaming.

01:06:53.646 --> 01:06:54.882
I didn't want this.

01:06:56.181 --> 01:06:58.548
How many others?

01:06:58.550 --> 01:06:59.516
This is over now.

01:06:59.518 --> 01:07:01.654
No, no, it's not over yet.

01:07:03.556 --> 01:07:04.557
It's just starting.

01:07:05.425 --> 01:07:08.224
What do you want?

01:07:08.226 --> 01:07:09.629
I want her body.

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.298
I wanna see her.

01:07:14.166 --> 01:07:16.435
I don't know where she is.

01:07:20.572 --> 01:07:21.440
Do you watch?

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.177
You sick fuck.

01:07:27.179 --> 01:07:28.445
Did you watch all those people?

01:07:28.447 --> 01:07:30.014
- No.
- Yes, you did.

01:07:30.016 --> 01:07:30.715
No, I didn't watch.

01:07:30.717 --> 01:07:31.585
Say her name.

01:07:33.286 --> 01:07:34.988
Say her name, you
fucking coward.

01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:40.160
Bartholomew.

01:07:44.163 --> 01:07:45.496
She had red hair.

01:07:45.498 --> 01:07:46.363
I liked her.

01:07:46.365 --> 01:07:47.231
Where's her body?

01:07:47.233 --> 01:07:48.099
I don't know.

01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:48.766
Where is she?

01:07:48.768 --> 01:07:50.568
I don't know.

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:52.202
We're
walking out of here,

01:07:52.204 --> 01:07:53.371
and we're gonna go on a drive.

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:55.005
- This is done.
- You fucking coward.

01:07:55.007 --> 01:07:56.440
- You're coming with me.
- This is...

01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:57.311
Get up.

01:07:59.077 --> 01:07:59.744
Damnit.

01:15:43.576 --> 01:15:44.444
Come on.

01:19:50.288 --> 01:19:52.658
I hope this is streaming.

01:19:55.993 --> 01:19:59.862
This is the ,

01:19:59.864 --> 01:20:02.001
dark website, ZIPPER HOLE.

01:20:04.869 --> 01:20:06.738
They killed my sister.

01:23:04.384 --> 01:23:08.084
