<i>There are few words</i>
<i>that bring more joy</i>

00:07.433 --> 00:11.029
<i>to value-seeking Midwesterners</i>
<i>than "All U Can Eat."</i>

00:11.165 --> 00:12.290
Don't eat that!

00:12.418 --> 00:13.920
We're going
to King Henry's Buffet.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.132
Oh, are you crazy?

00:15.243 --> 00:17.995
Do you not understand?
We got a squatters coupon!

00:18.085 --> 00:20.751
We get to pick a table
and stay there <i>all</i> day.

00:20.836 --> 00:22.505
We're having lunch,
supper, dinner,

00:22.591 --> 00:24.408
second dinner, and dessert.

00:24.495 --> 00:25.825
Okay.
I got my game plan.

00:26.009 --> 00:28.945
I'm going cold to hot,
concentrating on meats.

00:29.103 --> 00:31.189
You want to beat the house,
you got to load up on the meats.

00:31.328 --> 00:33.405
Now, remember,
when we get to King Henry's,

00:33.510 --> 00:35.980
everyone has to have
<i>one</i> green on their plate.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.816
I'm kidding!

00:37.893 --> 00:39.759
How weird would that be
if I was serious?

00:39.837 --> 00:42.108
I'm going all soups.
I love their soups.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.558
Thousand Island, ranch,
blue cheese--

00:44.668 --> 00:46.693
Brick, those are
salad dressings.

00:46.823 --> 00:48.079
No, I don't think so.

00:48.146 --> 00:49.807
They have ladles and bowls
right next to them.

00:50.036 --> 00:52.800
I'm home!

00:52.981 --> 00:56.130
Okay. I'm here. I'm starving.
Let's go.

00:56.225 --> 00:57.163
Right after church.

00:57.238 --> 00:58.519
Oh, whoa! Church?

00:58.623 --> 00:59.822
We have to go to church first.

00:59.905 --> 01:02.455
We should at least thank God
for our squatters coupon.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.150
Oh, come on!
I don't want to sit in church.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.182
I can't take Reverend Hayver
on an empty stomach.

01:06.289 --> 01:07.582
No, no, no,
we have a guest minister--

01:07.724 --> 01:10.793
Reverend Eric Deveaux
from <i>Cleveland.</i>

01:10.910 --> 01:12.171
Very charismatic.

01:12.275 --> 01:14.762
He and Reverend Hayver are
on a minister-exchange program.

01:14.847 --> 01:17.459
Even dad likes him.
He's very entertaining.

01:17.569 --> 01:18.544
I'm gonna tell you something
right now.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.360
You can't outrun the Lord!

01:20.563 --> 01:21.919
Where you gonna run to, son?

01:22.030 --> 01:27.279
♪ Our voices will ring
foreve-e-e-r ♪

01:27.382 --> 01:33.075
♪ as o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one ♪

01:33.699 --> 01:35.630
Blows Reverend Hayver
out of the water.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.070
Ooh. Baby sister's
looking at colleges.

01:39.159 --> 01:39.796
Let's see.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.017
Purdue-- Pur-don't.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.571
IU-- <i>I</i> don't see <i>you</i>
<i>getting in there.</i>

01:45.781 --> 01:46.715
Wait. No.

01:47.043 --> 01:49.012
No, no, no!
Don't even think about it!

01:49.089 --> 01:50.683
East Indiana State
is <i>my</i> school!

01:50.826 --> 01:52.438
Mom, dad, make her stop!
Seriously!

01:52.561 --> 01:54.744
You know, I-I can go
wherever I want, Axl.

01:54.874 --> 01:56.455
You can't stop me
from thinking about it.

01:56.576 --> 01:58.703
I'm thinking about it right now!

01:58.818 --> 01:59.766
What?

01:59.853 --> 02:01.888
In fact, I'm gonna be
thinking about it all day!

02:01.952 --> 02:03.313
No. Make her stop
thinking about it. Make her--

02:03.403 --> 02:07.125
- ♪ Oh, East Indiana, we will fight
for you ♪ - No! That's not--

02:07.225 --> 02:08.889
- ♪ East Indiana, we will always

02:09.006 --> 02:10.988
Do you see this? Do you see
what's happening here?

02:11.160 --> 02:13.748
- No. Come on. - ♪ We shall defeat
them with our tongues! ♪

02:13.831 --> 02:14.736
No!

02:17.964 --> 02:19.835
Axl, your sister can go
wherever she wants.

02:19.934 --> 02:21.277
Sue, stop tormenting
your brother.

02:21.378 --> 02:22.955
Now, come on--
we got to go worship the Lord

02:23.048 --> 02:24.382
and then gorge ourselves.

02:27.003 --> 02:28.414
Who didn't want
to come here this morning?

02:28.491 --> 02:30.193
Show of hands.
Come on. Be honest.

02:30.279 --> 02:32.262
You're tired, it's early.

02:32.426 --> 02:33.670
You stayed up too late

02:33.750 --> 02:36.492
watching back-to-back episodes
of Burn Notice.

02:37.322 --> 02:39.759
- Put your hands down! - Okay, I see.
You're being accountable there.

02:39.858 --> 02:41.772
That's what I want to talk
to y'all about this morning--

02:42.508 --> 02:43.639
accountability.

02:43.717 --> 02:45.480
There's no way you're
getting into East Indiana State.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.060
I can do whatever I want, Axl.

02:47.186 --> 02:48.840
In fact, I am gonna pray to God

02:48.938 --> 02:50.885
that I get into
East Indiana State.

02:50.974 --> 02:52.074
What?
Don't you dare do that.

02:52.165 --> 02:52.923
Dear God--

02:53.026 --> 02:54.221
- Stop doing that.
- You can't control me!

02:54.363 --> 02:55.703
Fine--
I'm gonna double-pray

02:55.774 --> 02:56.738
that you <i>don't</i> go
to East Indiana.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.012
- Don't you dare!
- God, please--

02:59.536 --> 03:01.662
When you see
a stranger on the street and...

03:01.787 --> 03:03.630
- God, please don't let her go
to East Indiana State. - Stop it, Axl!

03:03.727 --> 03:04.359
Ow!

03:05.713 --> 03:06.540
Mike.

03:06.742 --> 03:08.555
Oh, you have
freakishly strong fingers.

03:08.759 --> 03:11.073
Hey! Knock it off.

03:11.154 --> 03:12.419
I'm serious.

03:12.572 --> 03:14.580
- God, please don't--
- Ow! Don't you--

03:14.657 --> 03:17.003
Axl, Sue! Stop it!
Stop it right now!

03:19.027 --> 03:20.933
I c--

03:25.554 --> 03:27.889
At any rate,
the Lord loves you.

03:27.983 --> 03:30.028
He loves your friends
that didn't make it, either.

03:32.044 --> 03:32.949
Hi.

03:34.602 --> 03:36.279
You're the Hecks, right?

03:36.509 --> 03:38.967
Could I see you for a moment?

03:41.331 --> 03:44.885
Let me just say
we are so sorry about earlier.

03:44.985 --> 03:46.821
This will <i>never</i> happen again.

03:47.002 --> 03:48.553
I-I never
talked to my family

03:48.650 --> 03:50.848
about not throwing
sacred books in church,

03:50.976 --> 03:54.148
but, in my defense,
I didn't think I had to.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.596
Folks, I don't want to take up
too much of your time,

03:56.799 --> 04:00.259
but it seems like you're under
a great deal of stress.

04:00.382 --> 04:02.889
No. We're fine.
Just a regular amount of stress.

04:03.006 --> 04:03.879
Yeah.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.664
Look. We kind of have...
somewhere we have to be.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.950
But we're fine.
We are.

04:08.037 --> 04:09.483
That was just
an isolated incident.

04:09.709 --> 04:11.903
Well, you know,
it's not just this one day.

04:12.035 --> 04:14.886
Uh, Reverend Hayver said,
you know,

04:14.988 --> 04:18.759
that there's been some issues,
a-a little history.

04:18.841 --> 04:19.668
Am-- am I right?

04:19.745 --> 04:21.298
- History? What history?
- The van.

04:21.403 --> 04:22.633
We gave it right back.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.732
Now, I assure you--
nobody's on trial here.

04:24.821 --> 04:27.840
I just like to reach out
to families in crisis

04:27.985 --> 04:29.620
and, you know,
offer some counsel.

04:29.717 --> 04:31.977
As the former
assistant spiritual advisor

04:32.088 --> 04:34.321
for the Cleveland Browns
for 1 and 3/4 of a season,

04:34.494 --> 04:38.022
consider me here
to lift you up.

04:38.198 --> 04:42.180
But to do that,
I got to able to get underneath.

04:42.307 --> 04:43.172
You know what I'm saying?

04:43.291 --> 04:48.351
And the deeper I dig,
the higher <i>we</i> can go.

04:48.439 --> 04:51.593
Oh, we're plenty high.
We are up there in the clouds.

04:52.357 --> 04:55.416
I mean, we fight, sure,
but we have fun, right?

04:55.595 --> 04:57.667
We do all kinds
of fun stuff together.

04:57.759 --> 04:59.143
We, um...

04:59.515 --> 05:01.984
eat... and...

05:02.112 --> 05:02.914
Come on, people.

05:03.017 --> 05:05.311
Tell him all the other
fun family stuff we do.

05:06.468 --> 05:08.440
Oh!
We play Twizzlestick.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.584
It's a really fun game
I invented.

05:10.718 --> 05:11.859
It's where you're in a room

05:11.949 --> 05:13.259
and you have
one body part showing

05:13.366 --> 05:15.327
and if nobody notices you
when they come in,

05:15.437 --> 05:16.665
you get a point.

05:22.645 --> 05:23.781
Twizzlestick!

05:26.200 --> 05:27.355
Twizzlestick!

05:28.234 --> 05:29.258
Twizzlestick!

05:31.643 --> 05:34.355
So, you all really get into
this, uh, Twizzlestick, huh?

05:34.448 --> 05:36.296
- Oh... sure. - So much fun.
- Not really.

05:36.392 --> 05:37.786
Love playing Dorklestick.

05:38.232 --> 05:40.961
You know what? This has
been great-- really helpful.

05:41.068 --> 05:42.470
But we're good.
We are.

05:42.554 --> 05:43.980
It's my fault.
I threw the book.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.379
But we're--
we're really good.

05:45.456 --> 05:46.205
Aren't we all good?

05:46.291 --> 05:47.908
- So good.
- We love each other so much!

05:48.029 --> 05:49.048
You sure?

05:49.149 --> 05:51.391
'Cause, you know,
when that teakettle's whistling,

05:51.567 --> 05:53.829
it's time
to take it off the stove.

05:53.923 --> 05:55.915
Yeah, but our teakettle
is fine.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.555
In fact, we're all heading out

05:57.679 --> 06:00.033
to eat together as a family
right now.

06:00.222 --> 06:02.669
Okay.
Well, fair enough.

06:02.901 --> 06:07.408
But if there's ever <i>anything</i>
<i>you'd like to talk about,</i>

06:07.506 --> 06:09.072
my door is always open.

06:09.175 --> 06:11.190
Nope. This was great.
Thank you.

06:11.258 --> 06:12.040
All right, then.

06:12.137 --> 06:13.877
You guys have yourselves
a blessed Sunday.

06:14.008 --> 06:15.813
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

06:16.344 --> 06:18.063
Sometimes I feel invisible.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:28.412 --> 06:31.536
So, Brick, what do you mean,
you feel invisible?

06:31.659 --> 06:33.957
No. He's not invisible.
Just ignore him.

06:34.114 --> 06:34.922
Ignore him?

06:35.026 --> 06:36.253
No! Not "Ignore."

06:36.357 --> 06:37.495
It's just,
he says things sometimes,

06:37.607 --> 06:38.532
but don't pay attention.

06:38.620 --> 06:39.918
You don't pay attention to him?

06:40.017 --> 06:41.242
No, we do, but it's just,

06:41.328 --> 06:42.857
he's insignificant
in this conversation.

06:42.958 --> 06:43.908
He's not invisible.

06:44.027 --> 06:45.095
Sorry, Brick.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.515
Great job, Brick.

06:53.592 --> 06:55.033
If we end up
at a table by the bathroom,

06:55.119 --> 06:56.606
I will pound you.

06:56.711 --> 06:59.436
Brick, can you, um,
expand a little more

06:59.545 --> 07:00.790
on what you were saying?

07:00.903 --> 07:03.300
Oh, it's just a generalized
feeling of invisibility.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.533
But I know my family really
wants to get to King Henry's,

07:05.628 --> 07:06.963
and I don't want them
to be mad at me.

07:07.107 --> 07:08.911
I can already sense
the hostility.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.732
- What-- That's ridiculous!
- What are you talking about?

07:10.833 --> 07:11.679
Come on, Brick.

07:11.797 --> 07:12.664
You know, maybe I should

07:12.742 --> 07:14.610
take a little time-out
with Brick alone.

07:17.221 --> 07:18.383
Crap.

07:20.017 --> 07:21.507
I am starving!

07:21.824 --> 07:23.803
I know, Axl.
We <i>all</i> are.

07:23.886 --> 07:26.829
No, you don't understand.
I haven't eaten in four days.

07:26.975 --> 07:27.930
I went full bear mode.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.038
I literally have had nothing

07:29.157 --> 07:32.288
but a handful of Chex Mix
and a plum in the last 96 hours.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.047
Let's just go.
Let's leave him here!

07:34.123 --> 07:35.897
Yeah, that's a great idea, Axl.

07:36.003 --> 07:36.757
We've just been accused

07:36.861 --> 07:38.158
of treating him
like he's invisible,

07:38.255 --> 07:40.214
and now you're suggesting
we ditch him.

07:40.337 --> 07:41.222
We can't, right?

07:41.313 --> 07:42.609
- Mike!
- What?

07:42.721 --> 07:44.268
We got our worst player
in there.

07:44.404 --> 07:45.936
We're never
gonna get out of here.

07:46.018 --> 07:47.231
This is terrible.

07:47.406 --> 07:48.870
If we're in trouble
with Reverend Deveaux,

07:48.994 --> 07:50.835
we're in trouble with God.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.195
You know they talk.

07:53.772 --> 07:55.831
I bet all the squatters
are squatting by now.

07:56.053 --> 07:57.170
No way we're getting a booth.

07:57.482 --> 07:59.618
Look. You know what?
Maybe this is a <i>good</i> thing.

07:59.736 --> 08:00.665
Did you not hear?

08:00.742 --> 08:02.869
He spiritually counseled
the Cleveland Browns.

08:02.972 --> 08:04.230
Cleveland, Mike.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.009
So... yeah.

08:06.161 --> 08:08.127
Besides, it's free counseling.

08:08.264 --> 08:09.675
I mean, are we really
in the position

08:09.778 --> 08:11.437
to be turning down
anything free?

08:11.531 --> 08:13.431
That's a bad road
to go down, Frankie.

08:13.551 --> 08:14.839
You can't look too close
at stuff.

08:14.940 --> 08:17.327
You pull one thread,
and the whole thing unravels.

08:17.501 --> 08:19.803
No good can come
from examining your life.

08:22.651 --> 08:24.061
So, let me--
let me get this straight.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.950
Your folks left you
with another family

08:26.032 --> 08:28.122
for a month
after you were born,

08:28.206 --> 08:29.769
you still eat dinner
in a lawn chair,

08:29.884 --> 08:33.852
and they made you wait 10 years
for a lime-green jello salad?

08:34.101 --> 08:35.807
That ain't right.

08:36.238 --> 08:38.616
Also, they never buy me
the kind of toothpaste I want.

08:38.806 --> 08:41.643
Everyone likes peppermint,
but I want wintergreen.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.501
I've always wanted
to try wintergreen.

08:43.666 --> 08:45.111
Wintergreen!

08:45.460 --> 08:47.248
Well, don't you ever
tell them this stuff?

08:47.393 --> 08:49.562
Well, I try, but they always
say things like,

08:49.696 --> 08:52.470
"Not now, Brick.
We can't hear the TV, Brick."

08:53.654 --> 08:56.143
You know, Brick,
you're the youngest,

08:56.309 --> 08:58.294
so you--
you're gonna have to speak up.

08:58.441 --> 09:00.479
I want to try something
that worked really well

09:00.569 --> 09:03.151
for a team I ministered to
called the Browns.

09:03.248 --> 09:04.897
I don't know what that is.

09:05.585 --> 09:06.935
It's a football team.

09:07.036 --> 09:08.024
Oh!

09:08.103 --> 09:09.718
Sports analogies
don't work for me.

09:09.828 --> 09:10.982
Okay.

09:11.316 --> 09:12.316
N-never mind.

09:12.441 --> 09:13.520
Uh...

09:13.842 --> 09:15.239
Let's put it a different way.

09:16.872 --> 09:18.066
If there was <i>one</i> thing

09:18.179 --> 09:21.301
you wished your family
understood about you,

09:21.444 --> 09:22.604
what would it be?

09:23.073 --> 09:24.129
Hmm.

09:24.479 --> 09:26.300
I guess sometimes I feel
that the whole family

09:26.389 --> 09:28.580
would be happier
if they didn't have me here--

09:28.682 --> 09:30.152
if I didn't exist.

09:30.558 --> 09:31.777
Wow.

09:32.183 --> 09:33.429
Brick, that's deep.

09:33.890 --> 09:34.995
That's...

09:35.691 --> 09:37.507
deep-down deep, man.

09:37.676 --> 09:39.140
You got to tell them that.

09:39.233 --> 09:40.013
Really?

09:40.094 --> 09:41.297
Yes!

09:41.379 --> 09:43.064
It's like I told
my dear friend Bono

09:43.152 --> 09:44.512
back in the Cleve
at his induction

09:44.614 --> 09:46.273
into the rock and roll
hall of fame--

09:46.396 --> 09:49.824
You gotta use your voice,
my man!

09:49.904 --> 09:51.404
Demand to be heard!

09:51.595 --> 09:53.420
Now, why don't I
bring your family back in here

09:53.532 --> 09:55.301
and you can tell them
how you feel?

09:56.312 --> 09:57.705
Couldn't hurt.

09:57.944 --> 09:59.529
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
checking on a few things.

09:59.634 --> 10:01.652
Um, how are you guys
on the mac and cheese?

10:01.974 --> 10:02.997
Mac and cheese is good.

10:03.107 --> 10:04.346
They just brought out
a fresh bucket.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.629
What's the jimmy situation?

10:05.745 --> 10:07.369
If you folks will come back in
and sit down now,

10:07.458 --> 10:09.767
Brick has something very
important he'd like to tell you.

10:10.473 --> 10:11.558
Is this something
my wife could handle

10:11.648 --> 10:13.197
and tell us about later?

10:18.544 --> 10:19.609
Go ahead, Brick.

10:19.701 --> 10:21.743
Tell your teammates
what you told me.

10:22.199 --> 10:23.753
It's safe, my man.
You got this.

10:29.030 --> 10:30.982
I really want
the wintergreen toothpaste.

10:31.782 --> 10:33.726
Um... okay.

10:33.821 --> 10:35.318
W-wait. H-hold on.

10:35.524 --> 10:37.035
Go on, Brick.

10:37.578 --> 10:39.179
What else?

10:40.460 --> 10:41.647
Oh. Right.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.074
See, 'cause you always <i>say</i>

10:43.165 --> 10:45.185
we're gonna get wintergreen,
but we never do.

10:45.283 --> 10:46.657
You just get peppermint.

10:47.185 --> 10:49.397
No. No. No.

10:49.528 --> 10:53.044
Brick, remember what you said
about how you feel?

10:53.134 --> 10:56.561
About how you think
they wish you weren't here?

10:57.825 --> 11:00.647
No, I-I think if I get
the toothpaste, I'm good.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.952
I mean, it really all comes down
to the toothpaste.

11:03.576 --> 11:04.487
I think we can do that.

11:04.595 --> 11:05.519
- Wintergreen it is. - Absolutely.
- I had no idea.

11:05.610 --> 11:06.422
He--

11:06.524 --> 11:08.435
Okay, well, this has been great.
Thanks for all the help.

11:08.547 --> 11:09.442
Well, okay.

11:09.537 --> 11:12.215
If you ever want to talk,
my door is always open.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.241
That's what I do here--

11:14.400 --> 11:16.258
any time a family's in crisis.

11:16.581 --> 11:18.872
All right, you know,
I-I just have to say one thing.

11:18.964 --> 11:20.913
I feel like
we've gotten a bad rap.

11:21.004 --> 11:22.412
I don't know
what Reverend Hayver told you,

11:22.503 --> 11:25.445
but we are not
a family in crisis-- at all.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.549
So... spread the word.

11:29.311 --> 11:31.939
I got drunk at a party
and danced inappropriately.

11:42.565 --> 11:44.855
Sue, what are you talking about?
When did this happen?

11:44.999 --> 11:46.458
Well, it was about a week ago.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.804
Remember I went to that party
for J-P-La?

11:48.968 --> 11:51.504
There was this lemonade, and...

11:51.783 --> 11:55.922
I don't know what happened,
but I got so drunk!

11:57.532 --> 11:58.609
Hey, you like that?

11:58.708 --> 11:59.869
It's got alcohol in it.

12:00.057 --> 12:03.867
So, you just took a sip
and you spit it back out?

12:03.937 --> 12:04.609
Yeah.

12:04.711 --> 12:06.193
I don't think you were drunk.

12:06.330 --> 12:07.798
Oh, no. I was.

12:07.892 --> 12:09.450
It affects <i>me differently.</i>

12:09.547 --> 12:12.400
My body's not full of alcohol,
like yours!

12:12.797 --> 12:15.226
Threads, Frankie.
Threads.

12:15.316 --> 12:16.571
Something happened.

12:16.807 --> 12:19.155
I had reduced inhibitions.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.602
You don't know what I did.
You didn't see it.

12:21.757 --> 12:23.917
I did a terrible,
terrible thing.

12:24.053 --> 12:26.148
I don't even want to say it!
It was so horrible!

12:26.254 --> 12:27.458
Sue.

12:29.258 --> 12:30.677
I twerked!

12:37.484 --> 12:38.355
A-- aah!

12:41.475 --> 12:42.291
See?

12:42.389 --> 12:43.379
That's exactly
why I don't want her

12:43.489 --> 12:44.567
at East Indiana State.

12:44.687 --> 12:45.445
Are you gonna send me

12:45.535 --> 12:46.582
to some six-month
military camp

12:46.686 --> 12:49.792
where they scream at you
and make you crawl through mud?

12:49.896 --> 12:51.069
I may need that!

12:51.250 --> 12:53.720
Well, I think we've got a handle
on the problem now.

12:53.784 --> 12:55.704
It's twerking and toothpaste.

12:55.791 --> 12:56.761
Thanks, Reverend.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.602
No! I think
I really need help.

12:58.693 --> 13:00.562
I feel like
I'm headed down a bad path.

13:00.667 --> 13:03.035
I think I need a one-on-one
with Reverend Deveaux.

13:04.259 --> 13:05.382
Brick got one.

13:07.814 --> 13:09.758
<i>By this point,</i>
<i>even</i> I <i>had reached my limit.</i>

13:09.922 --> 13:12.099
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I'm all for free therapy,</i>

13:12.200 --> 13:13.804
<i>but I was starving.</i>

13:14.720 --> 13:17.119
Aren't parents supposed to
sacrifice for their children?

13:17.651 --> 13:18.696
Fine.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.819
Ew!

13:22.916 --> 13:24.305
What is this?!

13:24.414 --> 13:25.673
Wintergreen.

13:25.997 --> 13:26.876
Oh.

13:27.012 --> 13:28.605
I guess
I don't like wintergreen.

13:30.114 --> 13:30.781
Oh!

13:30.882 --> 13:32.387
And then, one time,
someone called

13:32.480 --> 13:34.371
asking us to participate
in a short survey,

13:34.485 --> 13:37.498
and I told them we were busy,
but we weren't.

13:37.664 --> 13:39.712
I totally could have
taken the survey.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.273
I was voting
for the Teen Choice Awards,

13:41.385 --> 13:43.058
and I voted <i>twice.</i>

13:43.156 --> 13:45.164
I just love Kaley Cuoco
so much.

13:45.293 --> 13:46.610
Thank you.

13:49.001 --> 13:51.245
Did you even know she was going
to this party the other night?

13:51.474 --> 13:53.060
Yes, I knew she was going.

13:53.414 --> 13:54.951
Did you know
there'd be alcohol?

13:55.211 --> 13:58.042
Yes, I knew there'd be alcohol,
so I rushed her right over.

13:58.158 --> 13:59.754
But first, we stopped
at my dealer's house

13:59.836 --> 14:01.456
and did some pot.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.457
I'm just saying--
she's getting to the age

14:03.535 --> 14:05.078
where you got to keep your eye
on these things.

14:05.171 --> 14:07.957
Oh, I do?
She has <i>two</i> parents, Mike.

14:08.027 --> 14:09.870
I took her to dinner.
She likes cheeseburgers.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.309
Ohh! Don't talk about food.

14:12.389 --> 14:15.325
Oh, sweet, sweet cheeseburgers.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.391
Yeah, you're such a great dad.

14:16.470 --> 14:18.027
You threw a book
at our son's head!

14:18.097 --> 14:19.179
I didn't throw it <i>hard.</i>

14:19.258 --> 14:20.954
That old lady
popped right back up.

14:22.399 --> 14:23.242
Y-you know,

14:23.348 --> 14:26.423
I-I don't think fake giggling
while being tickled

14:26.536 --> 14:27.822
counts as a sin.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.527
No? Are you sure?

14:29.695 --> 14:30.961
Positive.

14:31.179 --> 14:34.653
Look, Sue, middle school
can be a tough time.

14:34.737 --> 14:35.610
I'm in high school.

14:35.774 --> 14:36.638
Really?

14:36.749 --> 14:38.024
Freshman?

14:38.097 --> 14:39.233
Junior.

14:39.330 --> 14:40.452
Wow.

14:40.570 --> 14:41.549
Anyway, my point is,

14:41.646 --> 14:45.673
I've never met a more
upstanding, conscientious,

14:45.869 --> 14:48.901
and loquacious young woman.

14:49.178 --> 14:50.850
So, you think I'll be okay?

14:50.929 --> 14:53.443
I do. I do.
I really do.

14:53.711 --> 14:56.174
But your door
is always open, right?

14:56.271 --> 14:57.405
Well, semi-open.

14:57.503 --> 15:01.216
You-- l-limited,
uh... office hours.

15:01.316 --> 15:04.012
But, you know, Reverend Timtom
is always here, too.

15:04.129 --> 15:05.307
Save some stuff for him.

15:05.390 --> 15:06.571
Okay.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.942
When you borrow my car,
put some gas in it!

15:12.039 --> 15:13.210
Oh, we're gonna talk
about cars.

15:13.302 --> 15:16.891
You drove my car for three days
with the parking brake on!

15:34.538 --> 15:36.046
We can see you, Sue.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.057
Okay. You got me.

15:38.173 --> 15:39.545
That's one point for you.

15:40.109 --> 15:41.102
Doorknob!

15:43.906 --> 15:45.939
You didn't say "Twizzlestick"
before I grabbed the doorknob,

15:46.052 --> 15:47.613
so now we both get a point.

15:47.932 --> 15:50.492
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.578
Ha!

15:51.850 --> 15:54.140
You didn't say "Twizzlestick"
while I was saying that,

15:54.272 --> 15:56.281
so another point for me!

15:56.375 --> 15:58.626
Sue, no one wants to play
your stupid game!

15:59.372 --> 16:00.968
Wow.
Are you grumpy.

16:01.309 --> 16:03.742
Sounds like somebody should go
talk to Reverend Deveaux.

16:03.885 --> 16:05.172
He's really good.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.077
He doesn't walk away,
like dad does,

16:07.186 --> 16:08.407
when you talk to him.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.146
Did he feed you in there?
You seem really up.

16:12.528 --> 16:13.526
Axl.

16:16.826 --> 16:18.422
- You doing okay, Mike?
- Mm.

16:18.523 --> 16:19.907
You seem a little on edge.

16:19.989 --> 16:20.777
No, I'm fine.

16:20.848 --> 16:23.632
It's just... we have someplace
we got to be.

16:23.762 --> 16:26.146
Well, there's no time
like the present, Mike.

16:26.311 --> 16:28.682
- Right.
- No. Listen to me, Mike.

16:28.810 --> 16:32.319
There's no time
like the present.

16:32.473 --> 16:33.785
It's a gift, my man.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.648
That's why they call it
"The Present."

16:36.741 --> 16:37.256
Ah.

16:37.341 --> 16:39.466
Open it up. See what's inside.
You feel me?

16:39.545 --> 16:41.663
- Uh... sure.
- Okay, good.

16:41.796 --> 16:43.949
Now, what I always like to
preach back home in Cleveland--

16:44.047 --> 16:45.417
y'all know
I'm from Cleveland, right?

16:45.518 --> 16:46.453
- I've heard.
- Uh-huh.

16:46.536 --> 16:47.769
What I always like to preach

16:47.878 --> 16:49.537
is that when a team or a couple

16:49.680 --> 16:53.916
have a good relationship,
the whole family will benefit.

16:54.028 --> 16:56.875
But it must... start... here.

16:57.002 --> 16:59.203
Mommy and daddy.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.557
Quarterback and star receiver.

17:01.862 --> 17:02.562
Hmm.

17:02.650 --> 17:05.983
Now, Mike, is there anything
about your past

17:06.180 --> 17:07.730
that you'd like to talk about?

17:08.279 --> 17:09.391
Nope.

17:09.872 --> 17:11.867
Anything about your family?

17:11.990 --> 17:13.253
Nope.

17:13.391 --> 17:15.733
H-how about your relationship
with your brother?

17:16.023 --> 17:17.127
Who told you I have a brother?

17:17.252 --> 17:18.296
Never mind. Moving on.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.027
Frankie, what about you?

17:20.160 --> 17:23.099
Oh. Uh, I think I had
a pretty great childhood.

17:23.183 --> 17:25.257
Yeah, but it--
it can't be easy <i>now.</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:29.646
Three kids, family on a budget,
your work, you're stressed.

17:29.749 --> 17:30.552
Yeah.

17:30.659 --> 17:31.814
Yeah, life can be overwhelming,

17:31.946 --> 17:33.469
a-and you just need
to let it out.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.390
Mm-hmm.

17:34.488 --> 17:35.679
And you're also
at that stage of life

17:35.781 --> 17:37.589
where you not only
have to take care of your kids,

17:37.718 --> 17:39.421
but your parents
need you more now.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.484
Am I right?

17:40.567 --> 17:42.668
That's true.
That's definitely happening.

17:42.920 --> 17:43.752
Mm-hmm.

17:43.995 --> 17:46.700
Can't be a lot of time
for <i>you</i> in there. Hmm?

17:46.820 --> 17:49.685
Mom is the toughest job
in the world,

17:49.868 --> 17:53.471
and you do have
a great husband here in Mike.

17:54.053 --> 17:55.387
I do.

17:56.455 --> 17:58.203
I love him so much.

18:00.635 --> 18:02.057
Oh.

18:02.173 --> 18:03.405
Okay.

18:03.732 --> 18:05.048
It's okay.

18:05.821 --> 18:07.197
It's all right.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.192
So, you ever meet Lebron?

18:11.501 --> 18:12.370
Twice.

18:12.840 --> 18:13.661
Hmm.

18:14.822 --> 18:15.721
God, what I wouldn't give

18:15.812 --> 18:18.140
for some Thousand Island soup
right now.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.537
Oh, I can't believe I came home
from college for this.

18:20.629 --> 18:22.881
I just spent the entire day
in church.

18:22.981 --> 18:24.561
I don't know.
I actually feel better.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.132
I'm glad we came.
I feel renewed.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.649
It's a whole new start for me.

18:28.763 --> 18:29.949
You ate in there, didn't you?

18:30.066 --> 18:31.460
I know you ate!
What did he feed you?!

18:31.552 --> 18:33.103
Ohhh...
God, I'm lightheaded.

18:33.634 --> 18:34.804
Oh, wow.

18:34.974 --> 18:36.326
I'm spent.

18:36.617 --> 18:38.120
So, who's ready to eat?

18:38.199 --> 18:38.984
- Food!
- Me!

18:39.080 --> 18:40.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
W-we're just getting started.

18:40.659 --> 18:43.259
What this team needs now
is one more big huddle,

18:43.406 --> 18:44.544
where we lay out
some goals--

18:44.615 --> 18:46.237
No! No way!

18:46.328 --> 18:48.405
Look, I don't know what
you think is happening here,

18:48.505 --> 18:51.345
but I got to tell you,
this is not a family in crisis

18:51.463 --> 18:53.095
or whatever--
like, at all.

18:53.171 --> 18:55.100
I mean, yeah, some of the time,
we can't stand each other,

18:55.235 --> 18:56.482
and if my sister
goes to my college,

18:56.584 --> 18:58.027
I will be forced
to change my name

18:58.159 --> 19:00.391
and get a cheap
Mexican face transplant,

19:00.487 --> 19:01.540
but we are tight.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.644
We hang with each other
and we goof on each other

19:03.742 --> 19:04.540
and we crack each other up,

19:04.648 --> 19:06.344
and we're always there
for each other.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.634
I-I think that's because
we have parents

19:08.768 --> 19:10.811
who every day,
a million times a day

19:10.973 --> 19:13.322
show us what being a family
is really all about.

19:13.541 --> 19:15.298
I mean, they have our backs,
and we have theirs.

19:15.406 --> 19:16.610
And isn't that the whole point?

19:16.773 --> 19:18.559
Just having each other's backs?
I mean, right?

19:18.643 --> 19:21.049
That's... basically
what Jesus is saying.

19:21.184 --> 19:23.090
I know
it's not pretty to look at,

19:23.207 --> 19:24.367
but we get the job done.

19:24.459 --> 19:25.443
It's like a...

19:25.742 --> 19:27.444
like a crappy-looking
football team

19:27.566 --> 19:29.548
that manages to win 10 games
every season.

19:29.644 --> 19:30.706
We win ugly.

19:30.912 --> 19:32.600
It's just how we roll.

19:34.629 --> 19:38.036
Wow! Well said, Axl.

19:38.122 --> 19:41.975
To have a-a young man
back up his team like that

19:42.086 --> 19:43.507
gets me right here.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.713
I really feel that.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.187
You know, I don't, uh...

19:49.326 --> 19:51.784
throw this type of compliment
around often,

19:52.570 --> 19:54.978
but you guys are
such a tight-knit group...

19:55.992 --> 19:58.254
You remind me...

19:59.286 --> 20:01.620
of the '87 Browns.

20:03.003 --> 20:04.996
Best of luck, Heck family.

20:05.555 --> 20:06.835
Go get 'em.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.612
- He bought it.
- Way to go!

20:12.702 --> 20:13.494
Whoo! Axl!

20:13.575 --> 20:14.986
Young man.

20:15.164 --> 20:17.000
- Whoo! Come on. Whoo!
- Let's eat.

20:17.834 --> 20:18.625
Come on, come on, come on!

20:18.750 --> 20:21.890
You go Oriental, I'll go Indian.
Sue, you're on desserts.

20:21.975 --> 20:23.435
Axl, you hit
the carving station.

20:23.530 --> 20:25.463
I got the soups!

20:25.814 --> 20:27.797
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:27.903 --> 20:29.058
Right here.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.275
Mmm. Okay.

20:36.420 --> 20:37.919
Take an egg roll,
dip it in this hot cheese,

20:38.019 --> 20:39.557
and chase it
with a sprinkle cookie.

20:39.646 --> 20:40.730
Mmm!

20:41.391 --> 20:42.826
Hey, here's to Axl

20:42.927 --> 20:44.714
for finally getting us
out of that place.

20:44.803 --> 20:45.941
- Mm.
- Cheers!

20:46.034 --> 20:47.902
- To Axl!
- Whoo-hoo!

20:47.988 --> 20:48.797
Got to hand it to you--

20:48.883 --> 20:50.170
that thing about
"A million times a day

20:50.259 --> 20:52.830
showing what family's
all about"-- that was genius.

20:52.909 --> 20:55.243
I had to bite the inside of
my cheek so I wouldn't laugh.

20:55.336 --> 20:57.265
I didn't know you could
put words together like that.

20:57.366 --> 20:58.968
But I always told you
you had a good imagination.

20:59.101 --> 21:00.646
You should take a writing class
in school.

21:00.724 --> 21:02.343
Yeah. Well, uh...

21:02.537 --> 21:04.847
actually, I wasn't just
saying it to get out of there.

21:04.926 --> 21:08.834
I, uh... kind of...
sort of meant it.

21:15.289 --> 21:17.361
It's okay.
They're happy tears.

21:17.515 --> 21:18.754
- Right?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.199
I'm so happy.

21:20.323 --> 21:22.466
<i>Who knows why Axl said</i>
<i>what he said.</i>

21:22.564 --> 21:25.084
<i>Maybe he was hallucinating</i>
<i>from lack of food.</i>

21:25.166 --> 21:26.391
<i>Maybe he meant it.</i>

21:26.482 --> 21:27.349
<i>All I know is that</i>

21:27.428 --> 21:29.745
<i>in the game of Twizzlestick,</i>
<i>Parenting Edition,</i>

21:29.878 --> 21:31.490
<i>we were on the board.</i>

21:31.866 --> 21:37.295
<i>Sure, we were losing 476 to 1,</i>
<i>but that 1 sure was sweet.</i>
