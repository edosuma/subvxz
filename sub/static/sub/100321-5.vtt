WEBVTT

00:02.793 --> 00:03.823
As your publicist,

00:03.911 --> 00:06.104
it is my job to optimize
a branded approach

00:06.249 --> 00:08.225
to real-time engagement
with your fanbase

00:08.313 --> 00:09.836
through contextual marketing.

00:09.923 --> 00:12.230
I hope I'm not paying you
by the word.

00:12.317 --> 00:14.145
Which is why I came up
with the ideation

00:14.232 --> 00:15.711
for the following idea.

00:17.931 --> 00:19.324
"Crows."

00:20.847 --> 00:22.240
"Movie."

00:23.763 --> 00:25.504
"Premiere?!"
They're doing a premiere?

00:25.591 --> 00:27.158
I thought it was streaming
on Interflix?

00:27.245 --> 00:29.508
Where are they
thinking? I.? New York?

00:29.595 --> 00:31.858
London might be central
for the Bosnian team.

00:31.945 --> 00:33.642
No, they're not doing
a premiere.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.254
Alexis, your flip-chart says
"premiere."

00:36.341 --> 00:38.299
Okay, will you let me finish
what I'm trying say?

00:38.386 --> 00:39.443
What're you trying to say?

00:39.531 --> 00:41.644
I'm sorry, why are you even
involved in this conversation?

00:41.732 --> 00:44.568
- What is it, Alexis?!
- Oh my God, okay!

00:44.695 --> 00:47.178
So I thought because they're
not throwing a premiere,

00:47.265 --> 00:49.565
we could plan a premiere
screening here in town.

00:49.653 --> 00:51.617
Could be like a cute
press angle.

00:51.704 --> 00:54.359
Oh, sure, for a scrappy
little novice,

00:54.446 --> 00:57.449
but not for someone
who's cut many a crimson rug.

00:57.536 --> 00:59.917
What's next, I sign my name
in the pavement

01:00.005 --> 01:01.156
outside Bob's Garage?

01:01.244 --> 01:04.039
Jocelyn gives you an
honourary degree at her school?

01:04.126 --> 01:06.655
Host the Met Ga-la
at David's store?

01:06.743 --> 01:07.797
I don't like that one.

01:07.885 --> 01:10.808
No, I have like big plans
for an immersive experience.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.787
Ronnie said that she can find
a red carpet,

01:12.875 --> 01:15.728
and Roland has a guy
who rents out live crows.

01:16.793 --> 01:19.079
I think we should take
the lead from Interflix.

01:19.253 --> 01:22.481
I cannot stop the masses from
gathering to view the film,

01:22.569 --> 01:25.960
but best... best to avoid
any fulsome indecorum

01:26.048 --> 01:28.567
until we're assured
a positive reaction.

01:28.654 --> 01:30.743
Remember that "Waterworld II"
premiere?

01:30.830 --> 01:34.279
Exactly, David. Oh, the last
place anyone wanted to be

01:34.367 --> 01:35.622
when those reviews came in

01:35.710 --> 01:37.364
was a glass-bottomed pirate ship

01:37.474 --> 01:40.346
in the middle of the ocean.
Mm.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.799
- Good luck though.
- Lick rust! Thank you!

01:44.520 --> 01:46.663
<font color=#FF00FF>*SCHITT's CREEK*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 06 Episode 05</font>

Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"The Premiere"</font>

01:52.379 --> 01:54.488
Can't thank you enough
for driving today, Stevie.

01:54.576 --> 01:56.513
I don't know what is going on
with my car.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.826
I do. It's a death trap that
needs to be set on fire

01:58.914 --> 01:59.844
and pushed off a cliff.

01:59.932 --> 02:01.981
Well, I'd love to say I had
a choice in the matter,

02:02.069 --> 02:03.477
but according to David,

02:03.564 --> 02:05.827
driving his fiancé to go
get his wisdom teeth out

02:05.914 --> 02:08.482
is totally within my maid-of
honour responsibilities.

02:08.568 --> 02:10.526
Okay, tell me
how I'm being unreasonable?

02:10.614 --> 02:12.312
Also, if this is what it takes

02:12.399 --> 02:14.270
to get you out of that dank
little apartment...

02:14.357 --> 02:16.925
Excuse me, I have a business
meeting this afternoon.

02:18.926 --> 02:20.898
Just gonna leave it at that?

02:21.568 --> 02:23.875
Mr. Rose asked if he could
come over to my place.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.578
I think he's gonna push for me
to come back,

02:27.135 --> 02:29.502
and I don't know
if I can say no.

02:29.819 --> 02:31.511
And that's a bad thing?

02:31.654 --> 02:33.395
I'm supposed to be looking
for other jobs.

02:33.490 --> 02:35.046
Okay. Honestly, Stevie,

02:35.134 --> 02:37.779
what other job is better
than owning your own business?

02:37.867 --> 02:40.434
I guess I just feel like after
making such a big deal out of...

02:40.587 --> 02:42.405
wanting to see what else
is out there,

02:42.493 --> 02:44.081
isn't it kind of... pathetic

02:44.642 --> 02:47.418
to like... crawl back?

02:47.506 --> 02:49.188
Don't answer that.

02:49.296 --> 02:51.603
I already turned down another
job interview today.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.289
Maybe you just needed to see
what you didn't want

02:54.377 --> 02:55.955
in order to figure out
what you do?

02:56.244 --> 02:57.651
Look at me. Two years ago,

02:57.754 --> 02:59.786
I thought I'd have a wife
and kid at this point.

03:00.191 --> 03:02.887
Yeah, well,
one out of two isn't bad.

03:03.038 --> 03:04.886
I've been told I'm...
very young at heart.

03:06.627 --> 03:08.306
Can you drive better,
please?

03:13.503 --> 03:15.375
- Hi.
- Uh-oh!

03:15.462 --> 03:17.594
Hello, Access Hollywood?

03:17.681 --> 03:20.450
Have I got a star sighting
for you!

03:20.799 --> 03:22.322
Very pawky, Jocelyn.

03:22.425 --> 03:23.470
I just heard the big news.

03:23.557 --> 03:25.733
A movie premiere
in our own backyard!

03:25.820 --> 03:27.082
I might have to buy a dress!

03:27.169 --> 03:29.432
Uh... save yourselves
the trip to Frocks4Less.

03:29.519 --> 03:30.711
From what I've heard,

03:30.799 --> 03:32.475
it's more of a minor league
viewing party.

03:32.563 --> 03:33.928
Well, I'm still excited.

03:34.016 --> 03:36.263
It reminds me of that time that
Renée Zellweger's brother

03:36.351 --> 03:38.259
came in here,
and I got him to sign a menu.

03:38.354 --> 03:40.007
I mean, he spelled
his name differently,

03:40.095 --> 03:42.746
but I swear it was him.

03:42.834 --> 03:45.106
Well, I don't know, Moira,
I'm no movie expert,

03:45.194 --> 03:46.893
but according to the early
reviews,

03:46.981 --> 03:49.112
you may have a hit
on your hands.

03:49.231 --> 03:50.536
- Reviews?
- Yeah.

03:50.623 --> 03:52.190
There was an article posted
on the Crows account

03:52.277 --> 03:54.453
that you made us all follow.
Come look!

03:57.097 --> 04:00.455
Ornithology Today!
Well, if anyone knows crows...

04:00.543 --> 04:03.201
"The Crows Have Eyes III
is 'good fun.'"

04:03.340 --> 04:05.815
Well, that's hyperbolic.
I mean, they already had "fun"

04:05.903 --> 04:07.494
and now they've
added "good."

04:07.582 --> 04:09.127
Keep reading!

04:09.482 --> 04:12.452
"The film showcases
the emotional depth

04:12.540 --> 04:14.256
and intellectual capacity

04:14.343 --> 04:17.781
of our oft-maligned friend,
the crow."

04:18.076 --> 04:20.563
We were resolute about not
making an issues movie,

04:20.651 --> 04:22.729
but I'm glad they picked up
on that.

04:22.817 --> 04:24.318
It mentions you, Moira.

04:24.406 --> 04:25.771
It does? Where?

04:25.859 --> 04:27.182
My eyes are blurred.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.642
Oh, here it is.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.374
"Moira Rose,
as Dr. Clara Mandrake,

04:31.462 --> 04:33.732
is delightfully unhinged."

04:34.623 --> 04:36.427
Do you know what they call
this, gals?

04:36.529 --> 04:38.279
An understated rave.

04:38.367 --> 04:40.129
Oh, it's too bad you won't be
there tonight.

04:40.217 --> 04:41.963
It would've been nice
to cheer you on.

04:42.051 --> 04:43.409
Yeah, and my plus-one,

04:43.497 --> 04:45.436
Janet from the Elmdale
Chronicle,

04:45.524 --> 04:47.326
would've really loved a quote.

04:47.414 --> 04:49.368
Well, you might want to tell
your friend Janet

04:49.456 --> 04:53.065
that there just may be a
bombshell attendee after all.

04:53.153 --> 04:56.106
Yay! A premiere!

04:56.194 --> 04:59.419
Oh, I don't know if I have
anything fancy enough to wear.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.463
Oh, my default is always
formal,

05:01.551 --> 05:05.171
but I'm sure no one will bat
a side-eye at black-tie casual.

05:06.078 --> 05:08.166
Oh, but do pack eyedrops!

05:08.254 --> 05:10.964
The film's first third is
densely packed with exposition,

05:11.052 --> 05:12.780
and you won't want to blink.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.888
Are you sure it's okay
that we haven't seen

05:14.976 --> 05:16.087
the first two movies?

05:16.175 --> 05:17.389
Oh, it's actually best.

05:17.477 --> 05:19.239
A lot of this film
blatantly contradicts

05:19.327 --> 05:22.020
what's been established
in the first two.

05:22.108 --> 05:24.749
Sorry, Twyla.
I'm not going to eat now!

05:31.267 --> 05:34.436
- Okay, here we go.
- That was a fun car ride.

05:34.524 --> 05:36.020
Yes, it was very fun.

05:36.108 --> 05:38.673
Thank you so much
for all the hot tips

05:38.761 --> 05:40.102
you were giving our Uber driver.

05:40.190 --> 05:42.549
For a second, I was concerned
about my rating,

05:42.636 --> 05:45.061
but I think he seemed to enjoy
all the wrong directions

05:45.149 --> 05:46.380
you were yelling at him.

05:46.468 --> 05:48.493
David, I'm hungry.

05:48.633 --> 05:50.615
♪ I'm a hungry, hungry hippo

05:50.703 --> 05:52.475
'Kay, we're not supposed
to feed you right now.

05:52.562 --> 05:54.644
Can you make me a lasagna,
David?

05:54.945 --> 05:56.087
Imagine?
No.

05:56.175 --> 05:57.613
I think we rest this
little voice,

05:57.701 --> 05:59.139
'cause you have been chatting
ever since

05:59.226 --> 06:02.110
the dentist's office.
Why are you so handsome?

06:02.198 --> 06:03.771
I mean, unless you wanna
keep talking.

06:03.859 --> 06:05.449
In which case,
that works as well.

06:05.537 --> 06:08.793
How come your skin is like...
perfect.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.172
It's a nine-step regimen
I do twice a day.

06:11.260 --> 06:12.666
- It's not a big deal.
- I'm tired.

06:12.754 --> 06:14.178
Oh, okay.
Well, you know what,

06:14.266 --> 06:16.243
we should probably get you
over to the bed.

06:16.331 --> 06:17.587
O-kay.

06:17.682 --> 06:20.020
You know what I really wanna do
with you?

06:20.108 --> 06:22.069
Uh-huh. Ethically speaking,

06:22.157 --> 06:24.270
I don't think we can do that
with you in this state.

06:24.358 --> 06:25.714
Have a baby.

06:25.810 --> 06:28.073
'Kay, we will make a baby

06:28.160 --> 06:30.510
as soon as you sober up.

06:30.597 --> 06:33.962
Oh no, not make a baby.
Have a baby.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.935
Like I wanna have like
a little baby with you.

06:38.256 --> 06:41.764
And we could just love it
and hold it and bounce it.

06:41.852 --> 06:43.680
Yeah, that's a...
that's a big one-eighty.

06:43.768 --> 06:46.944
- You would be such a good dad.
- Have we met?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.702
I wish you were my dad.

06:48.789 --> 06:50.321
Okay, now we're just
spiraling off

06:50.409 --> 06:52.219
- in all directions.
- Shh! Listen, okay?

06:52.307 --> 06:54.055
Come here, come here.
I got a secret.

06:54.142 --> 06:55.187
- I don't...
- Come on.

06:55.274 --> 06:56.623
Mm...

06:57.612 --> 06:59.048
David?

07:00.105 --> 07:01.497
I'm very hungry.

07:01.585 --> 07:03.368
Okay, there's nothing I can
do about that.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.948
- Wait. Just lie down with me.
- Okay.

07:05.036 --> 07:07.775
- I wanna, I wanna hold you.
- Mmhmm.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.446
Imagine us right now,

07:12.770 --> 07:15.259
but just with a little baby.

Advertise your product or brand here

07:24.474 --> 07:25.666
- Hey, Stevie!
- Hey...

07:25.754 --> 07:26.897
Hey.

07:28.126 --> 07:30.704
- Oh! What's this?
- Thank you.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.324
You didn't have to bring
anything.

07:32.412 --> 07:34.534
Oh, just a little
housewarming platter,

07:34.622 --> 07:36.471
since it's my first time here.

07:36.559 --> 07:38.338
Twyla whipped up
some sandwiches.

07:38.426 --> 07:40.500
- Hope you like mayo.
- Thank you.

07:40.588 --> 07:42.939
Wow, so this is,
this is your place.

07:43.784 --> 07:46.476
I'm glad you didn't feel
you needed to clean up

07:46.564 --> 07:47.883
on my account,
you know?

07:47.971 --> 07:50.756
It shows just how comfortable
a friendship we actually have.

07:51.579 --> 07:53.103
- I did clean up.
- Right.

07:53.191 --> 07:55.355
That's... what I meant.

07:55.443 --> 07:57.097
You didn't feel the need
to clean up,

07:57.185 --> 08:00.521
but I appreciate the fact that,
uh, that you did.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.787
How are things at the motel?

08:03.978 --> 08:06.937
Good. We bought the second
motel!

08:07.025 --> 08:10.986
First phase of many in
the Rosebud Motel expansion.

08:11.151 --> 08:13.112
Big things on the horizon,
Stevie,

08:13.200 --> 08:16.297
which is, uh, why I wanted
to sit down with you today.

08:16.385 --> 08:17.583
But not on your bed.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.464
Oh, here.

08:20.710 --> 08:21.885
Right.

08:23.381 --> 08:26.057
So... Stevie,

08:26.624 --> 08:28.661
it goes without saying that...

08:28.749 --> 08:31.120
you've been an invaluable part
of the team.

08:31.226 --> 08:33.183
You don't need to sell me
on the team, Mr. Rose.

08:33.272 --> 08:36.101
And when I was your age,
I had a million and one ideas

08:36.188 --> 08:37.897
and things I wanted to explore,

08:37.985 --> 08:40.292
and I know it takes time
to find the right fit.

08:40.535 --> 08:43.433
Which is why I have a proposal.

08:43.616 --> 08:45.619
Oh! Okay.

08:45.834 --> 08:47.314
I wanna buy you out.

08:48.552 --> 08:49.811
Oh!

08:49.899 --> 08:52.148
Now I know the motel has been
a weight on your shoulders,

08:52.236 --> 08:54.108
and I can offer you
installment payments

08:54.196 --> 08:55.980
to give up your status as owner.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.287
And that would give you
some financial stability

08:58.375 --> 09:00.900
while you take the time
and figure things out.

09:04.552 --> 09:07.853
I thought you were gonna try
to talk me into coming back.

09:07.941 --> 09:09.900
Oh, no, no.
That wouldn't be fair.

09:09.988 --> 09:12.168
Wouldn't be fair to you.
I'm not gonna stand in the way

09:12.256 --> 09:14.345
of you finding
what makes you happy.

09:15.170 --> 09:19.000
And, and speaking of,
I wanted to give you this.

09:26.169 --> 09:29.390
Oh, wow...

09:29.581 --> 09:32.764
I don't know what to say.

09:32.883 --> 09:34.639
Well, once you get past
the haircut

09:34.727 --> 09:36.602
and... the dated references,

09:36.690 --> 09:39.025
I'm sure you might find
something useful in there

09:39.113 --> 09:41.376
to help you get your footing.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.142
You don't have to downplay
your excitement

09:45.230 --> 09:46.866
on my account, Stevie.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.510
I'll be just fine.

09:59.345 --> 10:00.978
Okay, so I may have a problem.

10:01.066 --> 10:02.733
Oh, it's barely noticeable,
dear.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.446
We'll find you an electrologist.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.318
No, I'm talking about
the viewing party.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.102
I just got a call
from the Elmdale Chronicle.

10:08.189 --> 10:09.713
Ah yes, Jocelyn's guest.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.347
We'll need to set aside
an extra seat.

10:11.435 --> 10:12.991
Okay, it's just that I know
that you don't wanna make

10:13.078 --> 10:15.286
a big deal about of this,
so I can just tell them not to come.

10:15.373 --> 10:17.995
I may have been wrong and
you may have been not wrong.

10:18.132 --> 10:20.738
We can position this
as a terrifying tale

10:20.826 --> 10:24.129
premiering in an equally
spine-chilling town.

10:24.235 --> 10:26.982
If the ornithologist review
is any barometer, Alexis,

10:27.070 --> 10:29.768
we m-m-m-m-m may just have
a hit on our hands.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.020
Um, last week,
you told me explicitly

10:32.108 --> 10:34.041
that this was not a premiere,
and now it's too late.

10:34.128 --> 10:35.913
Alexis, if you want to cut
your teeth

10:36.000 --> 10:37.541
as a high-profile publicist,

10:37.629 --> 10:39.743
you'll need to get used
to throwing things together

10:39.830 --> 10:41.832
in a crunch.
I have four hours!

10:41.919 --> 10:43.094
That's eons!

10:43.181 --> 10:45.924
When Demi decided
on a Friday night at 6pm

10:46.044 --> 10:48.672
that she wanted to celebrate
her 40th in Aspen,

10:48.760 --> 10:51.276
her publicist had us
in parkas by 7.

10:51.363 --> 10:54.465
Sadly, Megan went into cardiac
arrest on the flight,

10:54.553 --> 10:57.023
but she perished doing
what she loved.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.676
Um, is that your gown?
What is that for?

10:59.764 --> 11:02.632
Oh, I thought I might
throw it on for tonight.

11:02.766 --> 11:04.115
So you're going to
the screening?

11:04.202 --> 11:05.993
Yes. A simple
"Thank you, Mother"

11:06.081 --> 11:07.858
might be a nice place to start.

11:07.945 --> 11:09.584
Also, I thought you returned
that?

11:09.672 --> 11:11.818
I did! Or I know I returned
a dress.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.653
A glittering, backless thing.

11:13.741 --> 11:14.946
Stella McCartney, I think.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.953
That was mine.
I've been looking for that.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.389
- Blame UPS.
- Ugh!

11:28.556 --> 11:30.971
Hey, Alexis,
this better be good.

11:31.059 --> 11:33.303
I was in the middle of
a pre-show bath,

11:33.391 --> 11:34.522
and with the baby around,

11:34.609 --> 11:37.243
I only get that kind
of me-time maybe...

11:37.331 --> 11:38.812
- five to six nights a week, so...
- Mmhmm.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.707
I assume this has something
to do

11:40.795 --> 11:42.754
with all the calls
we're getting from TV stations,

11:42.842 --> 11:44.532
asking where they can park
their vans?

11:44.619 --> 11:46.555
Um, yeah. So the premiere may
be getting

11:46.643 --> 11:47.930
like a little bit bigger
than I had

11:48.017 --> 11:48.921
- planned.
- Oh, sanp!

11:48.922 --> 11:49.973
It's a premiere now?

11:50.060 --> 11:51.278
'Cause first you said it was,

11:51.365 --> 11:53.193
and then you said it was
just a viewing party.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.755
Yeah, and, and if it's a
premiere, we're all in trouble,

11:55.843 --> 11:58.027
because my skinny jeans
are in the wash.

11:58.305 --> 11:59.625
No, it is a premiere.

11:59.713 --> 12:02.205
Unfortunately, that decision
was made like half an hour ago,

12:02.293 --> 12:03.419
so it would be really helpful

12:03.507 --> 12:04.847
if I could just tell you
what I need.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.500
Oh no, the red carpet that
you told me not to order?

12:07.611 --> 12:09.015
Yes, but at this point,

12:09.103 --> 12:10.343
I will settle for any shade
of red,

12:10.430 --> 12:11.853
and it doesn't have to be
sixty feet.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.423
Okay, good,
'cause all I've got

12:13.511 --> 12:15.260
is a 20-foot merlot
in my garage.

12:15.348 --> 12:18.023
I ripped out after the church
basement flooded.

12:18.111 --> 12:19.471
That sounds amazing.

12:19.559 --> 12:22.222
And obviously you're coming
to me for a little star power.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.659
I get it. It'd be good to have
a name there tonight.

12:24.746 --> 12:26.749
No. No. You're the crow
hook-up.

12:26.837 --> 12:28.989
I wanted to create like
a headline-grabbing moment

12:29.076 --> 12:30.259
where I release a bunch of crows

12:30.346 --> 12:31.873
just before the movie starts.

12:31.961 --> 12:34.877
Uh, excuse me,
it's a little late notice.

12:34.965 --> 12:36.314
What about the liquor license?

12:36.402 --> 12:38.229
'Cause I assuming people are
gonna wanna be drinking

12:38.316 --> 12:39.310
through this thing.

12:39.398 --> 12:40.965
Okay, we have a situation
on our hands

12:41.154 --> 12:42.547
that needs to be solved now.

12:42.634 --> 12:45.376
We have a 12-time Daytime Emmy
Award-attending actress

12:45.463 --> 12:47.682
coming to walk a merlot carpet
in hours,

12:47.769 --> 12:49.336
and press coming from all over,

12:49.423 --> 12:51.164
bringing attention to your town.

12:51.251 --> 12:52.905
So either you can help me out

12:52.993 --> 12:55.169
or I pull the plug now
and nobody wins.

12:58.432 --> 13:01.769
Fine. But you owe me a prime
spot on that carpet.

13:02.262 --> 13:04.264
Wait, you wanna walk
the carpet?

13:04.477 --> 13:07.137
Honey, it's a movie premiere,
is it not?

13:07.224 --> 13:08.965
- Ugh.
- And I assume the mayor

13:09.052 --> 13:10.967
is walking the carpet as well,
yes?

13:11.054 --> 13:12.945
Yes... if he has to.

13:13.066 --> 13:16.319
Okay, I will schedule your
arrival time when I get home.

13:16.407 --> 13:19.055
I would like to request
a time before Roland.

13:19.143 --> 13:20.818
- And I'd like to go first.
- Mm-'kay.

13:20.906 --> 13:21.935
All right, I better get back

13:22.022 --> 13:23.755
and put my skinny jeans
into the dryer.

13:23.843 --> 13:26.608
I think they're really gonna
pop on your 20-foot merlot.

13:26.696 --> 13:27.940
I think so too!

13:28.027 --> 13:29.787
They're gonna pop on
that carpet.

13:30.454 --> 13:31.813
Okay. Mm!

13:31.901 --> 13:32.946
Okay.

13:33.034 --> 13:34.157
Okay.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.476
Stevie! Perfect timing.

13:42.563 --> 13:45.707
I was having a technical issue
opening a file here.

13:45.795 --> 13:47.997
It's, uh, being finicky.

13:48.134 --> 13:50.702
Uh, remember, Mr. Rose?
I left you a sticky note.

13:53.247 --> 13:55.619
Ah! Boy, it's times like this

13:55.707 --> 13:58.014
I really miss having you
around, Stevie.

13:58.101 --> 14:00.415
Well, um, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about,

14:00.502 --> 14:02.241
Mr. Rose.
Um, you know

14:02.329 --> 14:04.107
how you told me
to take some time

14:04.194 --> 14:06.627
and figure out what made me
happy?

14:07.110 --> 14:09.460
Well, I think I have settled
on something.

14:09.645 --> 14:11.157
Is it Larry Air?

14:11.244 --> 14:13.072
'Cause they called me
for a reference,

14:13.159 --> 14:17.042
and also asked if I had any
interest in becoming a pilot.

14:17.305 --> 14:19.557
No, it's not Larry Air.

14:19.981 --> 14:21.777
So chapter one of your book

14:21.865 --> 14:23.867
is all about trusting
your instincts,

14:23.955 --> 14:25.650
and I haven't been doing that.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.513
Oh, well, that's okay, Stevie.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.245
I mean, learning to trust
your instincts

14:29.333 --> 14:32.613
is something that comes
with age and experience.

14:32.829 --> 14:36.516
No. I'm talking about
trusting your instincts.

14:36.901 --> 14:38.947
I think I've been taking them
for granted.

14:39.272 --> 14:41.830
So, you read my book?

14:42.919 --> 14:44.937
Most of the first chapter.

14:45.583 --> 14:48.679
I didn't sleep well last night,
so I kind of dozed off.

14:48.767 --> 14:51.540
Well, the first chapter is
more of an introduction, right?

14:51.628 --> 14:53.282
Setting the table.

14:54.081 --> 14:56.251
'Kay, but what I've realized

14:56.894 --> 14:59.151
is that you've given me
the opportunity

14:59.239 --> 15:00.946
to take this job
and run with it.

15:01.153 --> 15:04.513
So, if you really think
you can make something

15:04.601 --> 15:06.952
out of franchising this motel,

15:07.112 --> 15:09.911
I think I want to be part of it.

15:10.202 --> 15:11.565
You think?

15:11.950 --> 15:13.419
I wanna be part of it.

15:14.564 --> 15:16.130
I want back in.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.576
Oh!

15:25.231 --> 15:26.406
Yeah.

15:27.634 --> 15:30.050
Well, I... should probably
tell you

15:30.138 --> 15:33.892
that you don't necessarily have
to trust all my instincts...

15:33.979 --> 15:35.894
all the time.
Since you've been gone,

15:35.981 --> 15:39.033
I did have to bring on
a third business partner,

15:39.121 --> 15:40.456
and I may as well tell you
that it's...

15:40.543 --> 15:41.671
Roland. I know.

15:41.759 --> 15:43.252
He gave me his new business
card.

15:43.340 --> 15:46.035
Never saw so many typos
on a business card.

15:46.122 --> 15:48.949
Do you mind if we don't talk
about Roland right now,

15:49.037 --> 15:51.508
'cause I'm feeling really good
about this decision.

15:51.596 --> 15:53.265
Ah! Yeah, me too, partner.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.619
Me too.

15:54.932 --> 15:56.521
Listen, while you're here,

15:56.609 --> 15:58.696
I'm wondering if I can get
a couple more refreshers

15:58.784 --> 16:01.970
on... what happens after
the file gets opened?

16:05.947 --> 16:08.263
Uh... you may as well.
Yeah.

16:14.836 --> 16:16.142
Morning, sunshine.

16:16.230 --> 16:17.988
Mm. It's 5pm.

16:18.076 --> 16:19.315
But good morning.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.449
I really don't remember
how I got into this bed.

16:22.559 --> 16:24.126
I do.

16:24.214 --> 16:26.369
You were talking.

16:28.259 --> 16:29.898
- A lot.
- Uhoh.

16:30.066 --> 16:31.439
- What was I saying?
- Well,

16:31.527 --> 16:33.122
the conversation really ran
the gamut.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.768
You complimented
my flawless skin

16:34.856 --> 16:36.684
and called me the Jewish
Channing Tatum,

16:36.772 --> 16:38.604
which all tracks.

16:38.884 --> 16:42.583
But then you told me
you wanted us to have a baby.

16:44.518 --> 16:45.955
What else did I say?

16:46.043 --> 16:47.610
I put you to sleep after that.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.297
Wait. Are you,
are you joking?

16:49.385 --> 16:51.474
No. No, no.
You held me close

16:51.562 --> 16:53.924
and told me to envision
our lives...

16:54.047 --> 16:55.290
with a child.

16:56.137 --> 16:58.226
- I see.
- Mm-hm.

16:58.397 --> 17:01.226
That, uh, that must've
been scary for you.

17:01.385 --> 17:04.257
It was a little triggering.
Traumatizing.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.357
David, I know that you don't
want kids,

17:07.714 --> 17:09.640
and that's fine with me,
okay?

17:09.727 --> 17:11.442
I was very high on anesthetic.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.108
Okay, it's just that earlier
today,

17:13.196 --> 17:14.256
when we were in Stevie's car

17:14.343 --> 17:15.748
because your car's always
in the shop,

17:15.835 --> 17:18.005
you had mentioned that you'd
always pictured yourself

17:18.093 --> 17:19.473
having a kid.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.073
You've never pictured
yourself doing something

17:21.160 --> 17:22.732
- that didn't end up happening?
- Of course.

17:22.819 --> 17:25.019
I'm not married
to Christina Aguilera, am I?

17:25.435 --> 17:26.974
- David, I am happy...
- But it's...

17:27.063 --> 17:28.697
with the life I've got.

17:29.147 --> 17:30.671
I'm happy with you.

17:30.973 --> 17:32.479
Things change.

17:33.765 --> 17:35.245
Okay.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.682
You're a hundred percent sure

17:36.770 --> 17:39.164
you're not just saying
you don't wanna have a kid,

17:39.252 --> 17:41.011
but, in actuality,
you secretly do

17:41.099 --> 17:44.102
and are repressing that need
just for me?

17:44.284 --> 17:46.096
I don't wanna undermine
the significance

17:46.184 --> 17:48.005
of this conversation,
but I do wanna make it known

17:48.092 --> 17:49.941
that I was watching
"Bridget Jones's Baby"

17:50.029 --> 17:51.570
right before I went under.

17:52.118 --> 17:54.191
Okay, well that makes
a little more sense then.

17:54.286 --> 17:57.108
Mm. You would be a great dad,
though.

17:58.308 --> 17:59.330
Okay.

17:59.418 --> 18:01.322
You have a big old heart
in there, David.

18:01.435 --> 18:03.132
- Yeah. Yeah,
- There it is.

18:03.434 --> 18:05.567
- It's beating away.
- Mmhmm?

18:06.335 --> 18:09.299
Um... Can you grab me
those painkillers, please?

18:09.387 --> 18:10.874
I think I'm gonna need
a few of them

18:10.962 --> 18:12.304
if we're still planning on
making it

18:12.391 --> 18:13.495
to your mom's thing tonight.

18:13.582 --> 18:15.297
Okay, that's actually
a very good idea.

18:16.102 --> 18:17.315
I might take one myself.

18:17.403 --> 18:20.247
Apparently the first 15 minutes
are very, very dense.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.522
<i>Moira! Over here!</i>

18:25.619 --> 18:28.511
<i>Moira! Moira!</i>

18:28.639 --> 18:30.323
Well, break a leg, sweetheart.

18:30.411 --> 18:31.847
I'll be right here...

18:31.935 --> 18:33.334
10 feet behind you.

18:33.422 --> 18:35.424
No, John, tonight is special,

18:35.512 --> 18:38.623
and I'd like my hand-candy
by my side.

18:38.711 --> 18:39.847
- <i>Moira!</i>
- Oh.

18:39.935 --> 18:40.966
<i>Moira!</i>

18:41.054 --> 18:43.676
Okay, people, we actually
need to walk the carpet, okay?

18:43.764 --> 18:46.386
Move it along.
Ronnie? Look, we had a deal.

18:46.474 --> 18:49.041
Also, not everyone can be on
the carpet at once.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.152
Thank you.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.566
When exactly are we gonna get
this show on the road?

18:52.654 --> 18:54.107
As soon as you're off
the carpet.

18:54.195 --> 18:55.849
Okay, because Carmine
is saying

18:55.963 --> 18:57.453
that the crows are getting
restless.

18:57.541 --> 18:58.463
Mm!

18:58.551 --> 19:00.184
Where did all these people
come from?

19:00.272 --> 19:02.115
Why are your pupils
so dilated.

19:02.203 --> 19:04.015
- No, yours are.
- No, yours are.

19:05.201 --> 19:07.025
Why are you dressed
like a limo driver?

19:07.113 --> 19:08.437
Your mother insisted.

19:08.525 --> 19:10.657
Why are you both glassy eyed?

19:10.745 --> 19:11.964
What?

19:12.054 --> 19:13.149
Wow!

19:13.709 --> 19:16.156
So the crows are ready.
You just say a few words,

19:16.244 --> 19:17.623
and then give Carmine
the signal.

19:17.774 --> 19:19.377
Alexis,
Mommy's home now.

19:19.465 --> 19:21.229
I'll take it from here.

19:21.448 --> 19:23.624
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:23.721 --> 19:26.333
it is my great pleasure
to welcome you

19:26.421 --> 19:28.814
to a North American
screening of...

19:28.956 --> 19:30.697
the psychological thriller...

19:30.785 --> 19:31.919
Move it along.

19:32.007 --> 19:35.445
"The Crows Have Eyes III:
The Crowening!"

19:37.862 --> 19:40.076
Let the crowening commence!

19:40.615 --> 19:41.910
Oh!

19:44.797 --> 19:46.449
Alexis!

19:48.886 --> 19:50.235
- Oh ho!
- No!

19:50.322 --> 19:52.699
Please, everyone stay
calm!

19:52.787 --> 19:55.200
Whatever you do,
do not look them in the eye!

19:55.288 --> 19:56.704
Okay, you're making them
angrier!

19:56.792 --> 19:57.834
I'm not, Alexis!

19:57.922 --> 19:59.792
I know a bit of their language.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.313
CAW!

20:01.567 --> 20:03.265
CAW-CAW!

20:06.190 --> 20:07.669
This is fucked.

20:13.526 --> 20:16.742
The worst part is people are
being robbed of the experience

20:16.830 --> 20:18.632
of seeing the film
on the big screen.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.699
No, that's not the worst
part, Moira.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.654
It's fine. There were no
serious injuries,

20:23.742 --> 20:25.721
and, because people are
watching from home,

20:25.809 --> 20:27.103
there'll be more views that way.

20:27.191 --> 20:28.483
Okay, have you seen this yet?

20:28.571 --> 20:31.763
Some random news station just
posted video of the premiere.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.965
It's been shared 32,000 times.

20:35.053 --> 20:37.133
Well, all press is good
press, right?

20:37.221 --> 20:39.096
You might wanna watch it
first.

20:39.184 --> 20:41.725
Tonight, a murder
of wild crows attacked

20:41.813 --> 20:42.816
would-be audience members

20:42.904 --> 20:45.389
who had come to see a movie
about a crow attack.

20:45.484 --> 20:47.771
We must warn you,
the following content is pretty graphic.

20:49.947 --> 20:51.122
Oh!

20:51.260 --> 20:53.255
Okay, they weren't
"wild" crows.

20:53.406 --> 20:54.898
They were supposed to be
trained.

20:55.268 --> 20:57.091
Trained! Some of them were
painted seagulls.

20:57.179 --> 20:58.989
This is not good, Alexis!

20:59.076 --> 21:01.204
It sorta looks like people
are running away

21:01.292 --> 21:02.602
from your movie, Moira.

21:02.690 --> 21:04.263
You! Look
what you have done!

21:04.351 --> 21:06.838
Look what I've done?
This was your idea,

21:06.926 --> 21:09.227
and now I have to pay Ronnie
for damage to her carpet!

21:09.315 --> 21:11.652
What were the crows even
doing there in the first place?

21:11.740 --> 21:13.995
It's called an immersive
experience, David!

21:14.083 --> 21:16.368
Immersed in lawsuits maybe.

21:17.404 --> 21:20.015
Alexis, make it stop!

21:20.142 --> 21:22.074
