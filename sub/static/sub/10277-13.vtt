E.R. 6x13 "BE STILL MY HEART"

00:21.808 --> 00:23.101
Dad, what are you doing?

00:23.352 --> 00:25.895
Going through your mother's
record collection.

00:26.104 --> 00:30.815
The one from San Diego with that old
turntable, now you can throw it out?

00:30.982 --> 00:35.612
She did go through some strange
musical phases. Bless her heart.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.282
The dance phase. Cha-cha-cha!

00:39.491 --> 00:44.328
Tango. And the lounge lizard phase,
Tom Jones.

00:44.536 --> 00:48.248
I like a good show tune myself.
Remember "Oklahoma! "?

00:48.456 --> 00:51.334
"Oklahoma! "?
How could I not?

00:51.501 --> 00:53.627
You played it for me
when I was a kid.

00:53.835 --> 00:55.712
Then you won't mind one more.

00:55.963 --> 00:58.507
As long as it means no more
"cha-cha-cha. "

00:59.091 --> 01:02.761
- I gotta shave.
- Go ahead. Don't want to be late.

01:03.011 --> 01:07.514
I thought surgeons were supposed to
have horrible hours. Up very early.

01:07.723 --> 01:10.809
We do. I was up very late.

01:11.018 --> 01:14.354
- I see your father's been here.
- What?

01:14.688 --> 01:16.481
Crown Essential Bouquet.

01:17.022 --> 01:20.025
Over a year ago. I don't think
I've even used it.

01:20.192 --> 01:23.570
Well, I must be off.

01:24.404 --> 01:27.240
- What time is your angioplasty?
- What?

01:27.448 --> 01:32.036
You mentioned a laser angioplasty.
I thought I would observe.

01:32.203 --> 01:36.873
- Why would you want to do that?
- Well, my work with lasers is so...

01:37.082 --> 01:40.710
- Esoteric?
- Romantic.

01:40.918 --> 01:45.089
Wandering through the atmosphere,
watching the stars twinkle.

01:45.298 --> 01:48.342
I thought I'd come and
see the practical approach.

01:48.551 --> 01:50.718
I don't think it's even allowed.

01:51.428 --> 01:55.598
I'm sure as associate chief of surgery
you could make arrangements.

01:55.807 --> 01:59.435
Anyway, I'll call and check.
Perhaps I'll just drop by.

01:59.894 --> 02:02.895
Wait!
Mother, I don't think that's...

02:03.271 --> 02:05.608
...such a good idea!

02:13.738 --> 02:18.577
I wanted to get by a pharmacy to pick
up some refills on those prescriptions.

02:18.785 --> 02:21.079
I'm not gonna give you any scripts.

02:21.288 --> 02:25.458
I need the Combivent and the Vanceril.
I still got the Theo-Dur.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.375
You have emphysema.

02:27.626 --> 02:31.379
- I haven't needed O-2 for two months.
- You haven't seen the doctor in six.

02:31.588 --> 02:35.008
- You need to see a pulmonologist.
- Damn doctors.

02:35.216 --> 02:38.552
Ask a million questions when
all you need is the medicine.

02:38.761 --> 02:40.220
It's not good medicine-

02:40.428 --> 02:43.264
For one family member
to look after another.

02:43.473 --> 02:47.268
Why have a son for a doctor
when he can't give a prescription?

02:47.477 --> 02:51.772
- It's not that I can't.
- No, no. It's just that you won't.

03:56.995 --> 04:00.832
- Give these charts to Dr. Weaver.
- She's off today. Hold this.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.668
- What's this?
- Hearts. Valentine's Day.

04:03.735 --> 04:07.839
You give people flowers, cards,
tell them how much you love them.

04:08.005 --> 04:11.718
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- Thank you. That is so sweet.

04:11.926 --> 04:14.511
Don't they have
Valentine's Day in Croatia?

04:14.678 --> 04:19.014
Yes, we do. We even have
these little hearts."Be mine."

04:19.223 --> 04:21.809
- Don't eat them.
- "Dear one."

04:22.017 --> 04:24.478
- I gotta get to Radiology.
- "Cut-tie pie."

04:24.687 --> 04:27.064
- That's "cutie pie."
- Oh, thank you.

04:27.272 --> 04:29.858
I'm Abby Lockheart.
We'll help you.

04:30.067 --> 04:35.321
Could you find that young doctor? He
took care of my husband after the fire.

04:35.529 --> 04:37.907
- What was his name?
- Dr. Malucci?

04:38.115 --> 04:39.741
- No.
- Carter?

04:39.991 --> 04:42.702
- Yes, that's it.
- We'll find him for you.

04:42.911 --> 04:45.371
- Do you have a cough, Mrs. Connelly?
- No.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.375
- Pulse is thready.
- Any pain in your belly?

04:48.541 --> 04:50.542
- No.
- Any aching?

04:50.751 --> 04:54.129
I'm 81 years old, dear.
I ache all over.

04:54.338 --> 04:56.172
One, two, three.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.384
- There you go.
- Any pain when you urinate?

04:59.550 --> 05:03.955
- I seem to go all the time.
- We'll run some tests.

05:04.005 --> 05:07.057
- BP's 80/50.
- I'll find Dr. Carter.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.184
- Thank you.
- It's probably urosepsis.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.978
Start her on a liter of saline,
send her to CBC, a chem panel...

05:13.187 --> 05:15.314
...blood cultures
and a urine culture.

05:15.564 --> 05:16.732
What about antibiotics?

05:16.941 --> 05:20.444
Confirm the diagnosis. I'll see
what Carter wants to start her on.

05:20.694 --> 05:21.903
Mark!

05:22.153 --> 05:23.529
Hi.

05:24.139 --> 05:26.015
We have to stop meeting like this.

05:26.024 --> 05:28.742
Tell me we're going out
to dinner alone.

05:28.909 --> 05:31.412
Valentine's Day?
I wouldn't miss it.

05:31.621 --> 05:33.455
Fun morning with your mother?

05:33.464 --> 05:36.082
She's threatening
to visit me at work.

05:36.149 --> 05:39.585
- I'll finally get to meet her.
- Don't hold your breath.

05:39.794 --> 05:43.672
This is the woman who didn't even
phone me when she got into town.

05:43.681 --> 05:47.092
Remind me again why you
invited her to stay with you.

05:47.101 --> 05:50.052
Don't go there or I'll throw
you into the snow.

05:50.061 --> 05:51.829
Could you remind me again?

05:52.355 --> 05:57.268
- I can't believe- You!
- You asked for it! You asked for it!

05:58.102 --> 05:59.227
Paul Sobriki?

06:02.480 --> 06:03.890
Watch out!

06:06.334 --> 06:08.060
- Truce.
- You promise?

06:08.068 --> 06:10.279
- I promise.
- You promise?

06:10.229 --> 06:11.638
- I promise.
- Scout's honor?

06:11.647 --> 06:14.074
Scout's honor. I'm done.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.117
- Promise?
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:19.912 --> 06:23.165
- Just the snowballs, I guess, huh?
- Sorry.

06:24.791 --> 06:26.835
So you've got a bad headache?

06:27.044 --> 06:29.462
- Have you had them before?
- I took aspirin.

06:29.629 --> 06:32.548
- Where is the pain?
- It's around my right eye.

06:32.757 --> 06:34.133
- Are you nauseated?
- Yeah.

06:34.301 --> 06:36.092
Does light bother your eyes?

06:36.301 --> 06:39.304
Why don't we find a room
and get you checked out?

06:39.471 --> 06:41.639
Did you hit your head?
Let him answer.

06:41.805 --> 06:43.892
- He's my patient.
- You weren't around.

06:44.142 --> 06:47.228
- I'm here now, okay?
- This collar's pretty tight.

06:47.436 --> 06:50.314
Good morning, one and all.
Who's running this?

06:51.564 --> 06:55.068
- Dr. Chen, give me the bullet.
- George Hudson, 55, rear-ended-

06:55.318 --> 06:57.069
Complains of mild headache.

06:57.321 --> 07:00.823
- Mr. Hudson, I'm Dr. Greene.
- Actually, it's Dr. Hudson.

07:01.448 --> 07:03.992
Did anybody ask Dr. Hudson
what his specialty is?

07:04.201 --> 07:06.078
Family medicine.

07:06.328 --> 07:10.415
I'm from Philadelphia. I'm here
a couple days taking a CME course.

07:10.624 --> 07:12.875
I've landed myself
some eager Residents.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.461
- You have.
- They ask the right questions.

07:15.711 --> 07:18.588
- I'm glad.
- They don't wait to hear the answers.

07:18.797 --> 07:20.841
- My apologies.
- Let them continue.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.718
- You don't mind?
- No, it's kind of amusing.

07:23.927 --> 07:26.262
I was a house officer once myself.

07:26.471 --> 07:30.891
Continue your evaluation.
I'll be back to go over your workup.

07:32.392 --> 07:34.560
- Scream if you need me.
- June Connelly?

07:34.768 --> 07:36.855
You saw her husband
a few months ago.

07:37.105 --> 07:40.316
- I saw hundreds of patients since then.
- Do you have a minute?

07:40.525 --> 07:42.609
- I'm going to see a patient.
- This won't take long.

07:42.776 --> 07:43.819
I'll be there.

07:44.028 --> 07:47.864
I have a 23-year-old student
with right periorbital headache...

07:48.072 --> 07:51.992
...associated with nausea.
No fever, no history of migraines.

07:52.201 --> 07:55.537
This one is classic. I'm
thinking six of Imitrex, sub-q?

07:55.704 --> 07:57.705
- Sounds good.
- You won't examine him?

07:57.914 --> 08:00.417
I trust you.
Let me know how he does.

08:00.625 --> 08:04.170
- Is that a little more comfortable?
- Yes, thank you.

08:04.378 --> 08:06.922
- Mrs. Connelly.
- Yes.

08:07.256 --> 08:09.591
Here you are.

08:10.134 --> 08:14.721
- You probably don't remember me.
- Yes, I do. How are you feeling?

08:14.929 --> 08:18.974
Well, not too bad. They're
taking very good care of me.

08:19.182 --> 08:21.477
I'm sure.
You're in very good hands.

08:21.685 --> 08:23.521
Pressure's up to 85, systolic.

08:23.729 --> 08:26.522
Dipped 4-plus positive
for nitrates and leukocytes.

08:26.731 --> 08:29.818
- Which antibiotic do you want?
- Amp and gent.

08:30.652 --> 08:33.821
Try 500 milligrams of
Levaquin, IV piggyback.

08:34.071 --> 08:37.032
It's once-a-day dosing,
a little less nephrotoxic.

08:37.241 --> 08:39.241
Could I talk to you
for a second?

08:39.451 --> 08:40.743
- Mrs. Connelly?
- Yes.

08:40.951 --> 08:43.995
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Yes. Thank you.

08:44.246 --> 08:46.624
- You're very welcome.
- Bye.

08:48.208 --> 08:51.544
- Pressure's low.
- She has bacteria in her bloodstream.

08:51.753 --> 08:55.590
We need to get her pressure up
using fluids and inotropic support.

08:55.757 --> 08:57.883
Are you sure she wants all that?

08:58.258 --> 09:00.510
We should do everything we can.

09:00.718 --> 09:04.472
We'll do what she wants. That
may not include machines and tubes.

09:04.681 --> 09:07.975
In OB, doing everything
was pretty much automatic.

09:08.184 --> 09:10.936
This isn't OB. Talk to her.

09:14.105 --> 09:16.817
- Following Lucy's patient?
- She presented it.

09:17.025 --> 09:19.903
If you're gonna supervise,
do it more closely.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.656
- What's going on?
- I was coming to get you.

09:23.905 --> 09:25.199
- Name?
- Paul Sobriki.

09:25.408 --> 09:26.534
How are you feeling?

09:26.742 --> 09:30.620
My wife doesn't like
the diner either, and I...

09:30.787 --> 09:33.289
- He suddenly started babbling.
- He's puking.

09:33.498 --> 09:35.792
- He's altered. Why didn't you get me?
- I was on my way.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.210
You can meet me there.
Don't tell them.

09:38.418 --> 09:42.798
It could be encephalitis or meningitis.
You should've told me this.

09:43.173 --> 09:46.009
He seemed fine. And I was
coming to get you.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.969
Give him two of Ativan, IV push.
Check his calcium...

09:49.137 --> 09:52.639
...thyroid panel and tox screen.
I'll get an LP kit.

09:52.848 --> 09:55.851
- What have we got?
- Insulinoma. Gretel had seizures.

09:56.059 --> 09:57.227
Gretel? The patient?

09:57.435 --> 10:00.855
The workup was negative,
except for low blood glucose.

10:01.064 --> 10:03.524
Which suggested
an insulin-producing adenoma.

10:03.774 --> 10:07.444
CT showed a nodule in the pancreas.
I hope it's not malignant.

10:07.694 --> 10:08.987
That's very caring of you.

10:09.195 --> 10:12.365
I am capable of that on occasion.
This is one of them.

10:12.574 --> 10:13.866
I want to see her-

10:14.074 --> 10:16.661
- I haven't even-
- You can finish up later.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.580
She's ready for you, Dr. Romano.

10:19.788 --> 10:23.249
There, Gretel. There, there.
There, there. Good girl.

10:23.458 --> 10:27.085
- Robert, this is a dog.
- Correction. This is my dog.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.381
Ativan put him right out.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.385
- Draw the lidocaine.
- One and four for cell count.

10:35.594 --> 10:39.681
Protein and glucose in 2, and
Gram's stain and culture in 3.

10:39.848 --> 10:40.973
You got it.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.685
- Change over to a 27-gauge needle.
- I always do.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.187
- Very good.
- Okay. I'm ready.

10:51.107 --> 10:52.358
- Hold him!
- What do I do?

10:52.609 --> 10:54.360
- Hold him!
- Stop!

10:54.568 --> 10:58.030
Paul, relax! It's okay!
Just calm down! Calm down!

10:58.238 --> 10:59.573
What's in my back?

10:59.782 --> 11:01.867
Give him two of Ativan.
Lucy, keep going.

11:02.034 --> 11:04.744
We'll get blood in the spinal fluid.

11:04.952 --> 11:06.787
It's not gonna get any easier.

11:10.374 --> 11:11.751
I feel some resistance.

11:11.959 --> 11:15.545
- Just keep advancing.
- I'm not getting any fluid.

11:15.754 --> 11:17.047
- Do you feel a pop?
- No.

11:17.255 --> 11:18.422
Keep going.

11:19.048 --> 11:20.591
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.051
Stop, please.

11:23.218 --> 11:26.179
- You're hurting me. Stop.
- Check the stylet.

11:29.058 --> 11:32.602
- All right. We got it.
- Great.

11:32.811 --> 11:34.728
Paul, just relax. Just relax.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.730
Just relax.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.275
Hey, crystal clear. Good job.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.363
I have my breeds mixed up.

11:45.614 --> 11:49.741
I thought they were wiry little runts,
like that Australian silky thing.

11:49.950 --> 11:53.286
No, the Bouvier is robust,
squarely built, well-muscled.

11:53.494 --> 11:55.914
A hearty dog, you could say,
Dr. Romano.

11:56.122 --> 12:00.042
- Except for the pancreas.
- Lizzie, Alex, how's Gretel's BP?

12:00.251 --> 12:02.462
I don't know.
We don't have a dog cuff.

12:02.671 --> 12:05.965
Then start an arterial line
and hook her to a monitor.

12:06.172 --> 12:08.717
- An arterial line?
- Pretend you're in dog lab.

12:08.967 --> 12:11.219
- That's what I'm doing.
- Lizzie!

12:11.428 --> 12:14.263
It's not proper to be
operating on your dog.

12:14.471 --> 12:17.307
I'm chief of staff.
Is that proper enough?

12:18.141 --> 12:21.436
Would you have me leave her
to some poodle surgeon?

12:21.602 --> 12:24.064
Curved Crile to clamp off
that bleeder.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.401
Dr. Hudson has oat cell carcinoma.

12:28.609 --> 12:30.819
We asked him about
previous hospitalizations.

12:31.028 --> 12:33.571
Had chemotherapy, now in remission.

12:33.780 --> 12:37.241
Now presents with a mediastinal mass,
which is why he's flushed.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.910
- Superior Vena Cava Syndrome.
- The prognosis-

12:40.118 --> 12:41.537
25% one-year survival.

12:41.745 --> 12:45.915
Which is why we should blast him
with radiation to shrink the tumor.

12:46.124 --> 12:50.503
Recent literature shows chemotherapy
can reduce the tumor in two days.

12:50.754 --> 12:53.171
We should treat him
with platinum and VP-16.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.591
Which does Dr. Hudson want?

12:57.342 --> 12:58.594
Did you even ask him?

12:59.302 --> 13:01.805
I was about to, when Malucci-

13:01.972 --> 13:03.555
Stop it, both of you.

13:03.764 --> 13:07.476
I'll check in on another patient.
Then I'll see Dr. Hudson.

13:07.685 --> 13:10.437
- I'll present him with his options.
- What will we do?

13:10.645 --> 13:13.648
You are going to watch me
and say nothing.

13:15.442 --> 13:18.945
- How are you feeling?
- Pretty darn good here.

13:19.194 --> 13:23.991
- Pressure's 100/70.
- The fluids are making you feel better.

13:24.199 --> 13:29.495
Oh, no. I think it's this young man
here who is making me feel better.

13:29.704 --> 13:32.498
He gave me a Valentine's Day card.

13:32.664 --> 13:37.085
That's very thoughtful of Yosh.
Could we get you anything?

13:38.128 --> 13:40.297
- I am a little thirsty.
- Okay.

13:40.547 --> 13:43.007
- I'll get some ice chips.
- Thanks.

13:43.549 --> 13:47.261
I'm a bit chilly. Maybe you
could help me get my sweater.

13:47.469 --> 13:49.471
- Sure.
- Yes. It's down there.

13:52.974 --> 13:56.018
I didn't expect a card this year.

13:56.185 --> 14:01.190
- With Barry gone.
- I'm sorry about your husband.

14:01.398 --> 14:07.154
He was awfully sweet about
these little celebrations...

14:07.362 --> 14:09.280
...and anniversaries and things.

14:09.488 --> 14:11.949
He always remembered.

14:12.241 --> 14:17.037
Some of my lady friends
had to remind their husbands.

14:17.329 --> 14:19.664
I had to remind mine he was married.

14:20.122 --> 14:24.044
- That's not good.
- No. It definitely wasn't.

14:24.502 --> 14:25.878
Well...

14:26.211 --> 14:27.713
...did you...

14:27.922 --> 14:30.215
...see this pin?

14:30.424 --> 14:32.592
Barry gave that to me last year.

14:32.801 --> 14:35.178
I didn't bother to tell him...

14:35.385 --> 14:40.057
...that he had given me the exact
same pin the year before.

14:40.265 --> 14:42.267
That was very kind of you.

14:44.269 --> 14:47.522
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

14:47.731 --> 14:48.731
Yes.

14:50.399 --> 14:53.027
"Be still my heart."

14:54.528 --> 14:57.364
That's what Barry would say.

15:02.243 --> 15:03.578
And I...

15:05.537 --> 15:07.372
I still am.

15:09.917 --> 15:13.336
I tried calling your wife again.
I got the machine.

15:13.754 --> 15:17.924
Yeah. When she goes shopping
with her friends...

15:18.091 --> 15:21.302
I think she's getting me
something for Valentine's Day.

15:22.135 --> 15:24.596
Your spinal tap was negative.

15:25.972 --> 15:29.517
- You stuck me for nothing?
- We had to rule out meningitis.

15:30.142 --> 15:33.938
Sure. Okay. Yeah.
I have to go back to the diner.

15:34.146 --> 15:37.107
- What diner?
- Where I study. My books are there.

15:37.315 --> 15:39.818
- Do other students study there?
- Sometimes.

15:40.026 --> 15:43.237
Usually they go to the library.
We had those muggings.

15:43.445 --> 15:46.490
- I read about that.
- It could happen again.

15:47.491 --> 15:49.117
Someone tried to mug you?

15:50.160 --> 15:55.080
Could've. It's a long way from where
I park, and there are lot of bushes.

15:56.541 --> 16:00.628
- I'd like to go soon.
- We have to do a CAT scan of your head.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.129
That's an x-ray, right?
Isn't that bad?

16:03.297 --> 16:07.342
- They shoot radiation through you-
- It's not enough to do any harm.

16:07.968 --> 16:11.470
- CT's ready.
- Thanks. We'll be right there.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.520
I did a hernia on a gorilla once.
Med school.

16:21.687 --> 16:24.315
- Dear God!
- Gretel's brother had a hernia.

16:24.524 --> 16:26.734
Let me guess. Hansel?

16:26.942 --> 16:30.946
I'm sure you find it amusing
that I'd care so much about a dog.

16:31.155 --> 16:34.449
There's so much about you
that we don't know, Robert.

16:35.324 --> 16:37.576
What's going on?
She's tachycardic.

16:37.827 --> 16:40.121
- It's a seizure.
- We've lost her IV.

16:40.329 --> 16:43.374
- It's making her hypoglycemic.
- I can't get the line in.

16:43.582 --> 16:46.417
Get me an amp of 50% glucose!
Get out of the way!

16:46.918 --> 16:48.961
ET tube's come out.
She's hypoxic.

16:49.128 --> 16:53.257
- Tube her again!
- She's in V-fib. Get me the paddles.

16:54.841 --> 16:56.259
- Stand back.
- Hold on.

16:56.468 --> 16:58.469
I said, stand back.

16:59.721 --> 17:00.805
Clear!

17:04.058 --> 17:06.602
Superior Vena Cava Syndrome.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.521
That gives me what? A year?

17:11.521 --> 17:14.483
Radiation therapy is
the standard of care.

17:14.691 --> 17:17.403
No. Chemotherapy is an option.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.238
It could take two days
to resolve your symptoms.

17:20.489 --> 17:25.325
I'm worried the headache could indicate
elevated intracranial pressure.

17:25.577 --> 17:30.164
I think it's more likely a product
of listening to your Residents argue.

17:31.331 --> 17:33.167
That was a joke.

17:36.711 --> 17:39.547
We can begin the radiation therapy
right away.

17:39.798 --> 17:45.885
I had a patient who went with radiation
and developed a terrible esophagitis.

17:46.094 --> 17:49.347
Pain, bleeding, couldn't eat
for two months.

17:50.139 --> 17:54.061
If I've only got a year,
I at least want to be able to eat.

17:55.728 --> 17:58.397
I'll go with the chemotherapy,
Dr. Greene.

17:59.898 --> 18:03.109
He told the waitress at the diner
he was coming here.

18:03.359 --> 18:06.070
- Is that where you study?
- We meet at the library.

18:06.278 --> 18:09.407
- But the last couple months...
- Did something happen?

18:09.615 --> 18:12.992
He's gotten so weird.
He's wearing the same clothes.

18:13.201 --> 18:14.410
What about his grades?

18:14.618 --> 18:17.288
We went to college together.
He did well.

18:17.538 --> 18:19.457
But he's been cutting classes.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.877
- You socialize with him and his wife?
- Not much anymore.

18:23.085 --> 18:25.795
He keeps picking fights
with me about nothing.

18:26.630 --> 18:31.592
Keeps accusing me of stealing his
parking place. Stupid stuff like that.

18:32.051 --> 18:35.221
- Is it something serious?
- We don't know enough yet.

18:35.429 --> 18:39.099
- Should I go in?
- Let him sleep. You can see him later.

18:40.351 --> 18:41.601
What is it?

18:41.810 --> 18:44.478
Pressure's down to 75.
I paged Dr. Carter.

18:44.687 --> 18:46.231
Mrs. Connelly?

18:47.023 --> 18:48.732
Mrs. Connelly?

18:48.982 --> 18:50.441
What do you want to do?

18:51.610 --> 18:53.778
Abby, what do you want to do?

18:57.781 --> 18:59.284
- Carter?
- Not now.

18:59.451 --> 19:01.952
Paul Sobriki-
It might be psychiatric.

19:02.119 --> 19:03.162
Not now, okay?

19:03.870 --> 19:06.456
- What happened?
- Her pressure's 75, systolic.

19:06.665 --> 19:08.958
She's on dopamine,
10 mics per kg per minute.

19:09.167 --> 19:13.004
- She's still not making urine.
- She didn't want any heroic measures.

19:13.212 --> 19:16.340
- I had to get her pressure up.
- Dopamine's a resuscitation drug.

19:16.591 --> 19:19.759
She said no tubes or machines.
Dopamine's okay.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.013
- What if it's not enough?
- We give more fluids.

19:24.221 --> 19:27.975
You'll put her into congestive
heart failure, flood her lungs.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.395
Then what?
Will you intubate?

19:34.355 --> 19:37.567
- Will you?
- I'll stop the fluids if I have to.

19:37.775 --> 19:39.902
She'll have to be admitted to the ICU.

19:40.111 --> 19:43.197
Pressure's 90 on 10 mics of dopamine.
She's making some urine.

19:43.405 --> 19:44.655
Good, good, good.

19:47.033 --> 19:48.952
- It's working.
- Yeah, maybe.

19:53.747 --> 19:56.958
I don't know what you want!
Don't follow me anymore!

19:57.208 --> 19:59.002
- What's going on?
- Paul's going off.

19:59.252 --> 20:01.838
- He's trying to mess with me!
- Is this your patient?

20:02.047 --> 20:04.214
- He's Lucy's patient.
- You're supervisor.

20:04.465 --> 20:07.175
- He followed me down here.
- I was concerned.

20:07.342 --> 20:08.844
- Why's he up?
- I don't know.

20:09.052 --> 20:11.012
- I wanted a drink of water.
- Okay.

20:11.221 --> 20:14.181
Dr. Greene!
Dr. Hudson's going south.

20:14.390 --> 20:17.894
I'll take care of this. Get Paul
settled back into his bed.

20:18.102 --> 20:20.895
- I don't want him to come!
- He's not coming.

20:21.355 --> 20:23.564
- You all right?
- Yeah.

20:23.815 --> 20:26.817
I got to get back.
You'll tell that other doctor?

20:27.026 --> 20:29.112
- Yeah, sure.
- Dr. Hudson?

20:29.321 --> 20:31.364
He's altered. Unarousable.

20:32.824 --> 20:37.494
Elevated ICP. Get a Radiation Oncology
fellow down here right away.

20:37.702 --> 20:40.371
- I'll call them.
- He wanted chemotherapy.

20:40.580 --> 20:43.707
He won't make it to chemo.
20 of Etomidate, 100 of sux.

20:43.915 --> 20:45.793
- We need to intubate.
- I'll do it!

20:46.002 --> 20:47.377
Why don't I do it?

20:48.712 --> 20:51.214
- Feeling better?
- I'm kind of tired.

20:51.422 --> 20:54.091
- Lucy?
- I'll be right back.

20:56.510 --> 20:58.054
What's with your patient?

20:58.304 --> 21:01.348
Dr. Greene pulled him out
of a fight with his friend.

21:01.557 --> 21:03.683
- Abby's looking for you.
- He might be schizophrenic.

21:03.891 --> 21:06.477
- He meets the DSM-IV criteria.
- Did you page a psych consult?

21:06.685 --> 21:08.145
I was waiting
to present him to you.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.982
Get them down here, hand this guy off.
Patients are waiting.

21:13.274 --> 21:15.444
It's so hard to breathe.

21:16.861 --> 21:18.362
How's she doing?

21:18.571 --> 21:22.575
Pressure's down, 85/55
on maximum dopamine.

21:23.408 --> 21:26.078
She's got rales all the way
up to the apices.

21:26.244 --> 21:30.665
- Pulmonary edema from all the fluid.
- She was hypotensive.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.251
Still is.

21:33.251 --> 21:36.461
Her BP's too low for
nitroglycerine or morphine.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.422
You could try 40 of Lasix.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.425
Pulse ox is down, 79 on 100% oxygen.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.468
- I'm going to intubate.
- No.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.971
She has an infection we can treat.

21:46.220 --> 21:49.431
She only needs to be intubated
for a day until it clears up.

21:49.598 --> 21:51.434
You don't know that.

21:51.934 --> 21:56.938
She has multiple organ failure.
You may never be able to extubate.

21:57.147 --> 21:59.107
Then what? She spends two months...

21:59.274 --> 22:01.609
...hooked up to every machine
known to man?

22:01.776 --> 22:04.528
I know. I just want
to make sure that I-

22:05.404 --> 22:07.281
It's not about what you want.

22:14.578 --> 22:16.872
What happened when
she stopped breathing?

22:17.081 --> 22:21.961
It's called Cheyne-Stokes respiration.
It's associated with heart failure.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.511
- You change your shirt?
- Yeah. I saw four 6-year-olds.

22:33.720 --> 22:38.600
I think they ate too many of those
little hearts you warned me about.

22:38.808 --> 22:41.769
- All over me.
- Welcome to the ER Valentine's Day.

22:41.978 --> 22:44.521
Multiple trauma coming in.
Five minutes out.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.731
- Prep the Trauma Room.
- Meet you there.

22:48.025 --> 22:50.777
Watch out for the rebound
phenomenon with the glucose.

22:50.985 --> 22:53.947
- We'll monitor her closely.
- Does Gretel have insurance?

22:54.155 --> 22:55.990
We've had enough jokes for one day.

22:56.157 --> 22:59.534
I wasn't joking. Certain vets offer-
My God!

23:00.535 --> 23:02.288
Elizabeth. There you are.

23:02.537 --> 23:06.415
I've visited every department
looking for you. Good heavens!

23:06.707 --> 23:09.918
Mother, this is Dr. Robert Romano.

23:10.127 --> 23:15.007
This is my mother, Isabelle Corday.
She's visiting from London briefly.

23:15.215 --> 23:17.300
Lizzie never mentioned
a thing. Pleasure.

23:17.508 --> 23:19.177
Likewise.

23:19.343 --> 23:21.971
This, I take it, is not
the laser angioplasty.

23:22.179 --> 23:25.640
This is Gretel, who's been
suffering from an insulinoma.

23:25.848 --> 23:28.602
Thanks to a brilliant assist,
she'll be fine.

23:28.811 --> 23:31.396
Yes. I know how hard
Elizabeth trained.

23:31.605 --> 23:33.981
- We should-
- How are you enjoying Chicago?

23:34.231 --> 23:38.361
I'm here for a series of lectures.
Adaptive Optics, Wave-Particle Duality.

23:38.528 --> 23:41.989
I don't know why you'd want
to tax your mind with that.

23:42.238 --> 23:45.824
- We have a wonderful city.
- I'm giving the lectures.

23:46.575 --> 23:50.495
I should get Gretel settled in
Recovery. It was nice meeting you.

23:50.662 --> 23:51.705
And you.

23:51.914 --> 23:55.708
- Please don't ask about the dog.
- Was it an Old English?

23:55.917 --> 23:58.711
Bouvier.
I'm being paged to the ER.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.255
- I don't think I've seen that yet.
- Good. Good.

24:02.464 --> 24:05.842
- Did I hear multiple trauma?
- Mom, Dad and two kids.

24:06.008 --> 24:07.052
Help me.

24:07.218 --> 24:09.804
38-year-old woman,
front-seat passenger.

24:10.012 --> 24:12.640
Ejected 20 feet from the vehicle.
Pulseless.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.642
Two liters of saline en route.

24:14.892 --> 24:17.227
Robby, 11, rear-seat passenger.

24:17.436 --> 24:20.355
Left wrist pain. Alert and oriented.
No LOC.

24:20.564 --> 24:22.690
BP is 110/68, pulse, 110.

24:22.941 --> 24:28.321
And we've got Julia, 5. Also rear-seat
passenger. No head trauma. No LOC.

24:28.528 --> 24:32.157
Multiple facial abrasions.
BP is 104/60. Pulse is 96.

24:32.407 --> 24:35.827
- What was your name, sweetie?
- Julia. Where's Mommy?

24:36.035 --> 24:37.120
Come on, baby.

24:37.370 --> 24:39.038
- What is it?
- Multiple trauma.

24:39.288 --> 24:41.124
- This is my mother.
- How are you?

24:41.374 --> 24:43.667
- You better stay here.
- Of course.

24:44.752 --> 24:47.087
- Aren't they bringing my dad?
- They are.

24:47.295 --> 24:49.964
- Where did they take Mommy?
- They're helping her.

24:50.172 --> 24:51.341
Let's go help you.

24:51.591 --> 24:55.218
All right, let's go!
On my count. One, two, three.

24:55.427 --> 24:56.637
Driver needed extrication.

24:56.845 --> 24:58.097
- The husband?
- I think so.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.931
- Hold compressions.
- Heart rate, 40.

25:00.140 --> 25:01.807
No pulse. She's in P.E.A.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.642
Pulse ox, 82.
She's dusky.

25:03.851 --> 25:05.894
Set up for bilateral chest tubes.

25:06.103 --> 25:08.480
- Is your wrist sore?
- A little.

25:08.688 --> 25:12.984
- Can you tell me what happened?
- A car hit us. It was going fast.

25:13.151 --> 25:16.445
Robby, let's make sure
you're okay. Come back.

25:16.612 --> 25:20.408
I was sitting behind Mommy. I hit
my face on a broken window.

25:20.616 --> 25:22.451
We'll clean those scrapes.

25:22.617 --> 25:25.328
- Hit your head or pass out?
- No.

25:25.620 --> 25:28.914
- What about you, Julia?
- Can I go see my mom?

25:29.748 --> 25:33.085
Restrained driver with significant
passenger-space intrusion.

25:33.335 --> 25:36.505
The fire department had to extricate
him. Lost his pulse.

25:36.714 --> 25:40.884
No time to tube him. Broke
the steering wheel with his chest.

25:42.260 --> 25:43.469
Anything?

25:44.970 --> 25:47.473
Tension pneumo on the left.
Get a needle.

25:47.724 --> 25:49.725
- Betadine.
- I'll intubate.

26:02.902 --> 26:05.905
- Sit down so I can examine you.
- No, thank you.

26:07.157 --> 26:08.908
It's probably just a sprain.

26:09.117 --> 26:13.162
- How about you? Is this sore?
- Aren't they gonna let us see Dad?

26:13.328 --> 26:15.205
They'll let us know, honey.

26:15.497 --> 26:18.291
I'll clean up these abrasions
with saline.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.668
Get a left-wrist film
for Robby and keep it in a splint.

26:21.877 --> 26:23.838
Order a right-knee film for Julia.

26:24.047 --> 26:26.882
My knee's okay.
I want to go see my mom.

26:27.132 --> 26:30.802
-1200 cc's out the chest tube.
- Run in 2 units of O-neg.

26:31.011 --> 26:33.346
- Pulse ox, 73.
- What's on the monitor?

26:33.555 --> 26:35.055
- V-fib.
- Charge to 200.

26:35.305 --> 26:36.682
Stand by with epi.

26:37.850 --> 26:40.185
- And clear.
- Clear.

26:40.645 --> 26:42.604
- Charge to 300.
- What's your plan?

26:42.771 --> 26:45.815
Two chest tubes and
a pericardiocentesis.

26:46.358 --> 26:48.692
Good rush of air.
Hold on compressions.

26:48.860 --> 26:49.861
Got a pulse.

26:50.069 --> 26:52.488
Let's try for a pressure.
Chest-tube tray.

26:52.738 --> 26:55.031
Let's prep the left side.
Let's move.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.575
- Systolic's 60.
- That's a start.

26:56.825 --> 26:59.619
Keep the O-neg coming.
Get 4 units type-specific.

26:59.869 --> 27:01.411
Ten blade.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.540
- Call for a vent.
-32 French.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.584
- How are they doing?
- It doesn't look so good.

27:10.087 --> 27:14.214
Just keep your elbow at a right
angle like this. Thanks.

27:16.551 --> 27:17.884
- It hurts?
- A little.

27:20.928 --> 27:22.597
- Hook him up now!
- Peter.

27:22.805 --> 27:24.390
Come on, let's move!

27:25.517 --> 27:29.061
Let's start him on 100%.
AC of 14, 800 tidal volume.

27:29.311 --> 27:31.563
- He's bleeding out!
- We lost the pulse!

27:31.772 --> 27:33.274
Start compressions again!

27:34.941 --> 27:36.276
Where are you going?

27:36.527 --> 27:40.904
We gotta fix you up.
Why don't you come back with me?

27:43.658 --> 27:46.327
-60 cc's out.
- Another liter out the chest.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.995
- You want to keep autotransfusing?
- No.

27:50.247 --> 27:51.831
Hold compressions.

27:56.085 --> 27:57.253
Asystole.

27:57.794 --> 28:01.088
That's it.
Time of death, 15:35.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.098
Please be sure she's cleaned up.

28:18.354 --> 28:19.355
How's he doing?

28:19.564 --> 28:22.691
- Bleeding out through his chest.
- The wife's dead.

28:25.027 --> 28:29.531
- Should we prep for a thoracotomy?
- It's a full arrest from blunt trauma.

28:29.739 --> 28:33.951
- Isn't there something else we can try?
- He probably tore his aorta.

28:34.118 --> 28:36.788
We can't save him.
You can stop compressions.

28:46.129 --> 28:47.797
Asystole.

28:48.881 --> 28:51.258
Time of death, 15:37.

29:01.475 --> 29:04.687
- What shall we do about the children?
- I'll tell them.

29:04.895 --> 29:07.021
I'll go with you.

29:07.188 --> 29:08.690
Can you make sure...?

29:34.045 --> 29:35.964
Both their parents are dead.

29:37.798 --> 29:39.592
Oh, God!

29:40.425 --> 29:43.387
- What are we gonna do?
- We need to let them know.

29:43.637 --> 29:48.350
That asthma boy, his sats are dropping
and he's starting to have retractions.

29:48.517 --> 29:50.893
- Thanks, Lydia.
- It's okay.

29:54.188 --> 29:57.024
- Robby and Julia.
- Thanks.

29:59.068 --> 30:01.694
Hello, Robby. Julia.

30:02.154 --> 30:07.074
- I'm Dr. Kovac. This is Nurse Hathaway.
- I'll wait outside.

30:07.282 --> 30:09.244
No, please stay.

30:10.702 --> 30:13.871
We need to talk to you
about your mom and dad.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.375
The accident was pretty bad.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.879
- The car was going really fast.
- Yeah.

30:23.755 --> 30:28.092
We and the other doctors worked
really hard to help your parents...

30:28.301 --> 30:31.679
...but their injuries
were very, very serious.

30:31.888 --> 30:37.642
And despite everything we tried to do,
we were not able to save them.

30:39.019 --> 30:40.144
And they died.

30:45.608 --> 30:49.487
But I know they'd be so relieved
to know that you' re both okay.

30:58.869 --> 31:00.704
I want to see them.

31:04.165 --> 31:08.670
Okay. I'll tell you what to expect
when we go in the room.

31:09.087 --> 31:12.298
To help them breathe,
we put a tube in the mouth.

31:12.465 --> 31:14.341
That will still be in there.

31:15.384 --> 31:19.470
You will see other tubes
under the collarbone...

31:19.678 --> 31:24.058
...and in the arm that we
used to give them medicine.

31:24.267 --> 31:28.354
And they had a lot of scrapes
and bruises from the accident.

31:53.751 --> 31:55.378
That's okay.

31:56.085 --> 31:58.588
It's all right. It's all right.

32:20.858 --> 32:22.318
It's all right.

33:02.685 --> 33:03.895
Mom.

33:14.614 --> 33:17.365
- You're early.
- Didn't want to miss the party.

33:17.574 --> 33:19.700
- ER.
- You missed the decorating.

33:19.909 --> 33:21.118
Luck of the schedule.

33:21.327 --> 33:24.872
- She's answering the phones.
- Dr. Hudson's making movements.

33:25.081 --> 33:27.749
- That's good.
- Chen and Malucci are with him.

33:27.958 --> 33:29.167
Doing nothing, I hope.

33:30.001 --> 33:33.004
- He's starting to make-
- Purposeful movements.

33:33.171 --> 33:37.091
Could you take a deep breath in
and then exhale? Dr. Malucci?

33:37.299 --> 33:39.050
Good NIF and tidal volume.

33:39.259 --> 33:43.012
Okay. Dr. Hudson, we can
extubate you if you're ready.

33:43.221 --> 33:47.350
All right. Take another
deep breath in. And exhale.

33:51.187 --> 33:52.395
Very good.

33:52.562 --> 33:54.272
- What happened?
- Dr. Chen?

33:54.481 --> 33:58.943
- You had papilledema.
- We did radiation.

33:59.193 --> 34:02.028
They'll take you upstairs
and take it from there.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.949
I guess I owe you my thanks
for going against my wishes.

34:06.158 --> 34:10.120
It did set a bad example for my
Residents. But you're welcome.

34:13.621 --> 34:16.083
Radiation was the right call
after all.

34:16.250 --> 34:19.335
Chemo would've worked
if he hadn't had increased ICP.

34:19.585 --> 34:21.795
Do you know why
I only had one child?

34:22.047 --> 34:25.257
I didn't want to listen
to them arguing in the car.

34:25.666 --> 34:28.527
You don't know what she looks like,
but have you seen my mother?

34:28.536 --> 34:31.397
I do know what she looks like.
I met her.

34:31.447 --> 34:35.056
She's delightful. We're
going out to dinner tonight.

34:35.266 --> 34:38.061
- We?
- You, me, your mother and my father.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.429
- How did that happen?
- I'm not sure.

34:40.438 --> 34:44.525
She has a certain way about her.
I'm going to pick up my dad.

34:44.734 --> 34:47.152
She's at Doc Magoo's having a coffee.

34:47.569 --> 34:48.737
Mother!

34:50.697 --> 34:52.531
- I thought I'd lost you.
- No.

34:52.739 --> 34:55.909
By now I know this place
like the back of my hand.

34:56.118 --> 34:57.995
I met your Mark.

34:58.244 --> 35:00.164
Yeah. So I understand.

35:01.457 --> 35:02.498
And?

35:02.665 --> 35:06.878
He has a way about him, doesn't he?
Arranging this dinner tonight.

35:07.086 --> 35:09.338
He seems to want me
to meet his father.

35:09.588 --> 35:13.300
- Don't be silly.
- That's all right. I don't mind.

35:13.550 --> 35:16.135
By the way, Elizabeth,
I had no idea.

35:16.302 --> 35:20.139
- About what?
- About what you do. I had no idea.

35:20.431 --> 35:24.059
- This coffee's weak.
- You can have some more after dinner.

35:24.268 --> 35:27.145
I'm sure by then
I'll be on to the gin.

35:29.188 --> 35:32.400
- What are you doing in here?
- I wanted coffee.

35:32.608 --> 35:34.818
- That nurse wasn't around.
- Let's get back.

35:35.027 --> 35:37.738
- You're having a party here?
- Yes. Let's go.

35:39.238 --> 35:42.200
- Shouldn't it be bigger?
- Shouldn't it be red?

35:42.575 --> 35:44.411
Come on, Dad.
They are waiting.

35:44.618 --> 35:47.831
- I don't like being set up.
- You're not being set up.

35:47.996 --> 35:51.291
- It's freezing.
- I imagine this was Elizabeth's idea.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.419
- Not that I don't like her.
- It's just dinner.

35:54.627 --> 35:56.588
This is not my first barbecue.

35:56.796 --> 35:59.548
Your mother hasn't been
gone but for five months.

35:59.757 --> 36:02.634
Okay, fine. You stay here.
I'm going in.

36:02.843 --> 36:04.720
She's a Brit too, huh?

36:05.053 --> 36:06.721
Yeah, Dad, she's British.

36:06.888 --> 36:10.225
We should've had them over to our
house, played Tom Jones.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.601
Would you rather just go home?

36:17.189 --> 36:18.231
Lucy.

36:18.523 --> 36:19.941
I'll be right back.

36:21.067 --> 36:23.570
- What happened to Psych?
- They're backed up.

36:23.820 --> 36:28.198
Pick up some other patients.
Have you sutured the leg lac yet?

36:28.365 --> 36:31.117
- I'm on my way.
- Let Malik stay with this guy.

36:31.326 --> 36:33.203
Just forget it, Carter!

36:34.370 --> 36:38.207
- My father thinks this was your idea.
- Mom thinks it was yours.

36:38.415 --> 36:41.835
She was straddling the patient,
pumping on his chest.

36:42.044 --> 36:45.964
That's nothing. Mark saved this
chopper pilot in San Diego.

36:46.214 --> 36:48.424
Kid had a tension
pneumatic something.

36:48.633 --> 36:51.093
Shoved a tube in the side
of his chest.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.679
Elizabeth put a tube
down a man's throat.

36:53.888 --> 36:56.974
That's more difficult
than putting it into his chest.

36:57.182 --> 36:59.893
- How's it going?
- We're talking about many pilots.

37:00.060 --> 37:03.605
- She was saving a family.
- You're getting on well?

37:03.771 --> 37:05.606
- Absolutely.
- Couldn't be better.

37:08.608 --> 37:11.987
- What the hell...?
- It's a place where people sing along.

37:12.195 --> 37:14.238
You mean, like a karaoke thing?

37:14.405 --> 37:17.242
Well, not really.

37:19.451 --> 37:22.162
It's too bad they couldn't
get someone good.

37:25.748 --> 37:27.125
She is doing well.

37:27.292 --> 37:30.295
She's already chasing rabbits
in her sleep.

37:30.504 --> 37:31.545
Yeah, yeah.

37:31.754 --> 37:34.673
Does everyone think
I'm completely nuts?

37:34.881 --> 37:38.718
Of course not. Only those of us
who were in the surgery.

37:38.927 --> 37:41.888
I live alone. When I come
home, it's just Gretel.

37:42.054 --> 37:43.098
Right?

37:43.306 --> 37:47.018
If you showed the same compassion
for people that you show for....

37:47.643 --> 37:48.685
Never mind.

37:50.811 --> 37:53.481
She's NPO.
No food until she's passed gas.

37:53.691 --> 37:57.193
- Give me a break. She's a dog.
- Has she passed gas?

37:58.902 --> 38:00.611
Dr. Romano, the biscuit.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.324
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:23.508 --> 38:26.051
He has a really lovely voice.

38:26.218 --> 38:27.886
Can you sing, Mark?

38:28.345 --> 38:29.346
Nope.

38:30.471 --> 38:32.181
It's rather brave.

38:34.434 --> 38:37.477
When I was a kid, he used to
do this to embarrass me.

38:37.728 --> 38:39.897
Parents don't try
to embarrass their children.

38:40.064 --> 38:42.232
It's too easy to do it
by accident.

38:46.778 --> 38:48.237
He is pretty fearless.

39:13.343 --> 39:14.844
She's not in any pain.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.305
I know.

39:21.350 --> 39:23.185
And I know you were right.

39:23.851 --> 39:25.187
She was right.

39:28.814 --> 39:31.400
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks.

39:38.657 --> 39:39.658
Asystole.

39:46.704 --> 39:48.457
Time of death, 19: 19.

40:02.177 --> 40:04.178
Be still my heart.

40:17.357 --> 40:20.067
I can't believe your mother
knows all the words.

40:20.275 --> 40:23.445
We watched this movie 100 times
when I was a girl.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.531
- You liked it that much?
- No.

40:25.698 --> 40:27.741
She saw it as an object lesson.

40:27.949 --> 40:31.035
That women shouldn't define
themselves through men.

40:31.244 --> 40:32.495
Sorry?

40:33.245 --> 40:35.414
Well, Gigi was in love with Gaston.

40:35.581 --> 40:38.000
But Gaston only wanted her
to be his courtesan.

40:38.208 --> 40:42.462
She agreed, and her great aunt and
her grandmother gave her lessons.

40:42.671 --> 40:45.340
Then Gigi was unhappy.
So she told Gaston-

40:45.590 --> 40:47.216
Please stop, okay?

40:47.467 --> 40:50.802
I can't handle this evening
getting any more bizarre.

40:52.763 --> 40:54.389
All right, then.

40:58.017 --> 41:00.185
There's warmer places to be alone.

41:00.394 --> 41:05.232
The furnace room in the basement
and the incubators up in the NICU.

41:06.316 --> 41:08.694
I'd like to see you in an incubator.

41:09.111 --> 41:11.154
I'm happy to try.

41:16.116 --> 41:17.284
Well...

41:18.744 --> 41:22.205
You know, all those years
as an OB nurse...

41:22.955 --> 41:25.875
...98% of what you see
is just pure joy.

41:27.125 --> 41:29.878
It's the happiest day
of most people's lives.

41:30.879 --> 41:34.591
And the tragedy is horrible.

41:35.551 --> 41:39.386
Because it's a life cut short.
A mom, a baby...

41:39.594 --> 41:40.763
Sure.

41:42.514 --> 41:46.893
Today was the first day I saw an old
person die. I'm not used to it.

41:49.228 --> 41:51.272
You want the good news or the bad?

41:52.148 --> 41:53.440
Give me the bad.

41:53.857 --> 41:55.817
You never get used to it.

41:56.401 --> 41:59.111
The good news is,
you never get used to it.

41:59.654 --> 42:01.364
At least I haven't.

42:02.740 --> 42:07.995
So you may have come up here
to be alone, but you're not.

42:13.333 --> 42:15.793
You think they started the party
without us?

42:16.043 --> 42:18.629
I certainly hope not.
Heads will roll.

42:26.970 --> 42:29.514
So this is your
Valentine's Day party?

42:29.722 --> 42:31.391
Don't ask me.
It's my first one.

42:31.599 --> 42:35.478
- We have a bigger knife in the lounge.
- Couldn't find it.

42:35.685 --> 42:37.479
A lot more fun than OB.

42:37.688 --> 42:40.524
We really like to party
down here in the ER.

42:40.982 --> 42:44.652
Lucy didn't suture that leg lac?
He's been here for four hours.

42:44.861 --> 42:47.488
- Where is she?
- Waiting on a psych consult.

42:47.697 --> 42:49.990
Her patient in Curtain 3.

42:50.448 --> 42:54.547
- I wasn't sure you'd make it.
- Who can resist blue cake?

42:54.614 --> 42:56.265
Yuck!

42:57.725 --> 43:01.063
- The patients don't mind this music?
- What?

43:37.270 --> 43:39.158
Somebody!

44:09.210 --> 44:10.894
Lucy.
