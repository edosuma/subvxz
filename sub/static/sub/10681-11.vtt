Well, Han was a smuggler,

so that's what the Millennium Falcon
was built for, right?

00:20.979 --> 00:22.748
- Right.
- It's a smuggling ship

00:22.781 --> 00:25.684

to fly around and do what?

00:25.717 --> 00:28.020

rules and regulations

00:34.093 --> 00:35.694

00:38.564 --> 00:40.232
not have to answer to the Federation.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.574
- Yes.
- Chewbacca has to wear clothes.

No more of this just
running around naked,

all over the seats.

When I named my daughter Harley Quinn

16 years ago, I'd say,

03:09.716 --> 03:11.250

03:23.396 --> 03:26.266

Most of the time, the
villains, you know, I mean,

03:28.201 --> 03:30.036
they can get popular, but usually,

03:30.069 --> 03:31.705

There's a leather outfit.
She has a nurse outfit.

Sort of, like, bondage.

- Bondage.
- And, like, a corset.

I can't go any higher than $700.

I mean, the only reason
I'm even considering $700

05:26.551 --> 05:29.855
is because it's nuclear.

- ManBearPig from "Prophecy."

08:44.005 --> 08:45.707
- The BearPig?
- ManBearPig.

08:45.739 --> 08:47.475
Yeah. That's Talia Shire, right?

08:47.508 --> 08:49.777
- Yeah.
- That was her second best role.

08:49.810 --> 08:51.747
Really, not "Godfather," not "Rocky."

08:51.780 --> 08:54.382
[laughs] Second! I said second!

08:54.415 --> 08:56.050
I'm leaving you guessing
which one number one is.

08:56.084 --> 08:57.919
All right.

08:57.951 --> 08:59.954
So we're thinking that
she's better in "Prophecy"

08:59.988 --> 09:01.455
than "Godfather" or "Rocky."

09:01.488 --> 09:02.990
[laughter]

09:03.023 --> 09:04.959
Um, what are you looking to get for 'em.

09:04.992 --> 09:07.429
- 50 bucks apiece.
- Six times five, that's 300.

09:07.462 --> 09:09.030
- 300 bucks?
- 300, yeah.

09:09.063 --> 09:11.400
That's a little high, don't you think?

09:11.433 --> 09:12.760
Did you look these up lately.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.034
- We got wiggle room.
- Okay.

09:14.068 --> 09:15.871
If I were to go online,

09:15.904 --> 09:17.739
I'm sure we could find these
for, like, 20 bucks a pop.

09:17.771 --> 09:19.540
Maybe not number 1. Maybe number 1.

09:19.574 --> 09:21.810
Honestly, I believe we
could sell number 1 here.

09:21.843 --> 09:24.780
I think we can get $30
for this, maybe $15 each,

09:24.813 --> 09:26.081
or I don't know how much
this one's going for.

09:26.113 --> 09:27.748
You know, the "Zombie" cover.

09:27.781 --> 09:29.785
I think you could probably
get $50 for number 1.

09:29.818 --> 09:32.721
- In that condition?
- This is maybe a "fine".

09:32.753 --> 09:34.955
This has got some smudging on the...

09:34.988 --> 09:36.524
It does have some issues.

09:36.558 --> 09:37.959
Uh, that's gonna be a tough sell.

09:37.992 --> 09:43.598
I mean, I'm looking in
the area of 40 bucks.

09:43.631 --> 09:45.634
- For the lot?
- For the lot, yeah.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.803
Um, I could maybe go 20 apiece.

09:48.837 --> 09:50.972
I think I could do $60 for the lot then.

09:51.005 --> 09:53.475
Okay, all right. I understand, I mean...

09:53.507 --> 09:54.910
You know, considering what
I'm gonna sell 'em for,

09:54.943 --> 09:56.211
I don't think I'm
gonna get anywhere near

09:56.243 --> 09:57.878
what you're asking for.

09:57.911 --> 09:59.747
Um, I... I'll probably
hang onto them then

09:59.781 --> 10:02.117
and just try to trade 'em for
other issues that I don't have.

10:02.150 --> 10:03.685
Okay. Thanks for bringing 'em in, man.

10:03.718 --> 10:04.786
Of course, yeah, no.

10:04.819 --> 10:05.987
It was cool to see these again.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.122
Yeah, I appreciate talking to you guys.

10:07.155 --> 10:08.622
All right, man. Have a great day.

10:17.265 --> 10:18.900
The only way you can get
"NeverEnding Story" figures...

10:18.933 --> 10:20.592
- Are these.
- Is on the black market.

10:20.593 --> 10:21.496
Exactly.

10:22.886 --> 10:24.855
You got your horror movies,
you got your thrillers,

10:24.888 --> 10:27.758
but you got that subcategory
that means the most:

10:27.791 --> 10:29.359
splatter movies, man.

10:29.393 --> 10:31.561
Favorite splatter movie.
For me, hands down,

10:31.595 --> 10:33.618
gotta be "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"

10:33.668 --> 10:35.965
Toby Hooper goes, "You know
what? "I'm just gonna get graphic.

10:35.998 --> 10:37.600
"I'ma put it in Texas,

10:37.633 --> 10:39.536

10:39.569 --> 10:42.005
This family's gonna be nothing

10:42.037 --> 10:45.109
It's still a terrifying
movie. What about you?

10:45.142 --> 10:47.411
I'm gonna go with the John
Carpenter's "The Thing."

10:47.444 --> 10:48.946
Nice pull, man.

10:48.979 --> 10:51.748
When the creature's morphing
out of the human remains.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.751
You know, the spider head, uh...

10:53.783 --> 10:55.619
Spider head... Imagine you're a kid

10:55.652 --> 10:57.488
and, like, they show you
a head getting ripped off,

10:57.521 --> 10:59.790
and you're like, "Well,
that's fantastic."

10:59.822 --> 11:02.158
Then all of a sudden,
legs pop out of the head,

11:02.191 --> 11:04.128
and it gets up and
walks away like a spider,

11:04.161 --> 11:05.628
and they're trying to flame-throw it.

11:05.662 --> 11:07.631
John Carpenter owned us with that.

11:07.663 --> 11:09.633
What about you, Ming? Favorite splatter.

11:09.666 --> 11:11.701
I'm gonna be honest with you;
I don't know if I have one.

Well, I brought in
something fairly unique

17:02.637 --> 17:04.640
I wanted to show you, see
if you're interested in.

17:04.673 --> 17:05.907
Okay.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.178
These are Mexican bootleg figures

17:08.210 --> 17:11.748
from the 1984 film
"The NeverEnding Story:"

17:11.780 --> 17:14.715
the Rockbiter, Falkor, the G'mork,

17:14.749 --> 17:16.885
Bastian, Atreyu,

17:16.919 --> 17:20.256
and the signature piece, The Auryn.

17:20.288 --> 17:22.325
Oh, my god. I've never
seen these before.

17:22.357 --> 17:25.327
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

17:25.361 --> 17:29.932
<i>♪ ♪</i>

17:29.966 --> 17:32.267
- You guys are into this flick?
- This was our childhood.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.703
I mean, everyone's got
that signature movie.

17:34.737 --> 17:35.904
We watched this movie
over and over again.

17:35.938 --> 17:37.739
Oh, yeah.

17:37.773 --> 17:40.777
Did they do legit figures that
were released in America or...

17:40.809 --> 17:41.911
No.

17:41.944 --> 17:43.412
The only way you can get
"NeverEnding story" figures...

17:43.446 --> 17:44.280
Are these.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.282
- Is on the black market.
- Exactly.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.918
Bootleg figures that
were just made in Mexico,

17:48.950 --> 17:51.220
so that's what makes them special.

17:51.254 --> 17:53.223
Really? Contraband "NeverEnding Story"?

17:53.256 --> 17:55.358
Have you ever seen
"NeverEnding Story" figures?

17:55.391 --> 17:56.191
Never. I've...

17:56.225 --> 17:57.694
No, I don't think they did a toy line.

17:57.727 --> 18:00.330
So what, somebody in
another country was like,

18:00.363 --> 18:02.465
"This is needed," and made their own?

18:02.498 --> 18:04.299
They muled 'em over the border.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.570
[laughter]

18:07.603 --> 18:09.639
So why you looking to sell 'em now?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.940
Well, I'm getting into G.I. Joes,

18:11.973 --> 18:13.809
specifically preproduction.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.678
And I mean, that's my passion,

18:15.710 --> 18:17.447
so I'm looking for some extra money

18:17.479 --> 18:20.583
to, you know, finance that.

18:20.615 --> 18:22.285
Okay, you're look... So you're looking

18:22.317 --> 18:23.885
to get preproduction G.I. Joes.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.488
Like they're... they
go for money, right?

18:25.520 --> 18:27.356
Oh, they go for a hefty sum.

18:27.390 --> 18:28.591
Goofy fast.

18:28.623 --> 18:31.661
So, uh, what... what do...

18:31.693 --> 18:32.894
What do you need for these figures?

18:32.928 --> 18:34.764
I mean, what do they go for today?

18:34.796 --> 18:37.400
Well, you know, I've seen
'em go for $100 apiece.

18:37.432 --> 18:38.767
- I know that's...
- Wow.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.736
I think a fair offer would be 400 bucks.

18:40.769 --> 18:42.872
- $400 for all of 'em, huh?
- Yeah.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.873
Any chance you'd take $200 for the lot?

18:44.906 --> 18:46.441
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Oh, absolutely not.

18:46.475 --> 18:47.877
I'm sorry.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.445
I mean, I know you
got to make some money,

18:49.478 --> 18:51.614
but I couldn't do $200.

18:51.646 --> 18:54.283
Uh, I'm sorry. Where was I at now?

18:54.316 --> 18:56.919
He actually pulled it out while
I'm trying to conduct business,

18:56.951 --> 18:58.488
you know, negotiating a deal.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.489
You're talking about
the selfie stick still.

19:00.523 --> 19:02.358
[laughter]

19:02.391 --> 19:04.960
He's making me, you know,
lose my concentration.

19:04.994 --> 19:07.797
You know, in the art of the
deal, it's like high stakes poker.

19:07.829 --> 19:10.499
I think I was well out of the way.

19:10.533 --> 19:12.068
Do you see cameramen on the field

19:12.101 --> 19:14.037
filming athletes while
they're performing?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.704
No, they're on the sidelines.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.373
They're not in the athlete's way

19:17.405 --> 19:19.041
when they're trying to get the job done.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.843
Yeah, come on. Leave this athlete alone.

19:20.875 --> 19:23.945
[laughter]

19:23.979 --> 19:25.815
Um, where was I at now?

19:25.847 --> 19:27.383
- Uh, you s...
- What'd you throw it out at?

19:27.415 --> 19:29.351
You were at $350. No, I'm joking.

19:29.384 --> 19:33.021
You were at $200. I said $350.

19:33.055 --> 19:35.858
You said $350, countered with $350, huh?

19:35.891 --> 19:37.660
I could do $250, but I think

19:37.692 --> 19:41.330
that's really all I can
really invest in 'em.

19:41.364 --> 19:43.533
I'm not entirely sure
that I have... you know,

19:43.565 --> 19:45.367
and have somebody gonna come
in that's gonna want these.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.103
I mean, $250's the best I can do.

19:47.135 --> 19:48.738
What do you think?

19:48.770 --> 19:51.007
Yeah, I got to stay at $350. I'm sorry.

19:51.039 --> 19:52.741
All right, well, thanks
for bringing 'em in.

19:52.775 --> 19:53.671
I'm sorry.

19:53.821 --> 19:54.978
No, that's understandable.
That's all right.

19:54.978 --> 19:56.078
- It was neat seeing 'em.
- Yeah.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.580
Appreciate your time. Thanks a lot.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.715
Background in color here. And, uh...

19:58.748 --> 19:59.981
No problem. [laughter]

20:00.015 --> 20:01.517
All right, guys.

20:01.549 --> 20:03.518
A no sale on the
"NeverEnding Story" figures.

20:03.552 --> 20:05.488
Look at the disappointment
on Bryan Johnson's face.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.855
Tell everybody what happened.

20:06.889 --> 20:08.558
- Get close up and personal.
- Here. Here.

20:08.591 --> 20:09.859
- Let me hold it.
- Get me in here too, though.

20:09.892 --> 20:11.094
What happened? What?

20:11.126 --> 20:12.127
- Come on.
- Take this.

20:12.161 --> 20:14.130
Come on. Give me that back.
What are you doing?

20:14.162 --> 20:15.431
- [metallic snap]
- That.

20:15.463 --> 20:16.465
Oh.

20:16.498 --> 20:17.633
- [laughter]
- What the hell?

20:17.665 --> 20:19.434
He just Bo Jackson'd it.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.603
- [laughter]
- There you go.

20:20.635 --> 20:22.137
You owe me $15 for this.

20:22.171 --> 20:23.739
- That was $15?
- Yes.

20:23.773 --> 20:25.408
Got it in Chinatown.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.509
[laughter]

20:27.543 --> 20:29.946
I mean, you've ruined
the art of the deal, dude.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.780
- [laughter]
- He's exaggerating.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.783
I mean, I'm sorry if such a small thing

20:33.815 --> 20:35.852
distracted you or
threw you off your game,

20:35.884 --> 20:38.621
but every time I posted
a photo or video of us,

20:38.653 --> 20:40.455
I would... I started blowing up.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.458
[laughter]

20:42.490 --> 20:44.760
I mean, you wouldn't know
this, 'cause you're not online,

20:44.794 --> 20:46.027
but this is what was happening.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.864
- Walt is click bait?
- Yeah.

20:47.896 --> 20:49.631
[laughter]

20:49.664 --> 20:51.933
Oh, man, and just like a transformer,

20:51.967 --> 20:53.436
we got to Go-Bot out of here.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.638
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.073
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:57.105 --> 20:58.540
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:58.574 --> 20:59.842
Never be afraid to look 'em

20:59.874 --> 21:01.743
right in the eye of Agamotto, kids.

21:01.777 --> 21:02.745
Good night.
