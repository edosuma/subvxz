00:25.338 --> 00:27.072
You got something on your mind?

00:27.072 --> 00:28.081
It's Joe.

00:28.081 --> 00:29.866
Tonight's our six-month anniversary,

00:29.866 --> 00:31.787
but we can't celebrate until next week

00:31.787 --> 00:33.489
because he's flying to Las Vegas

00:33.489 --> 00:34.537
with his buddies.

00:34.537 --> 00:35.954
Oh, Vegas, huh?

00:35.954 --> 00:36.648
Great!

00:36.648 --> 00:37.684
Well, tell him not to miss the show

00:37.684 --> 00:39.057
at the Diamond Lounge:

00:39.057 --> 00:42.393
a Topless History of the World!

00:42.393 --> 00:44.025
If they've still got the same Bathsheeba

00:44.025 --> 00:46.217
he's in for a real treat!

00:46.217 --> 00:46.735
Oh yes,

00:46.735 --> 00:49.483
that's just where I want Joe
spending our anniversary,

00:49.483 --> 00:51.577
some smutty show in Vegas!

00:51.577 --> 00:54.945
No, it's very tasteful and 
historically accurate.

00:54.945 --> 00:56.835
Except at the end, where Eleanor Roosevelt

00:56.835 --> 01:05.010
and Eva Braun settle World War Two
by wrestling in pudding.

01:05.010 --> 01:05.951
Hello, Dr. Crane.

01:05.951 --> 01:06.704
Daphne.

01:06.704 --> 01:07.225
Oh, Niles.

01:07.225 --> 01:08.354
To what do we owe this pleasure?

01:08.354 --> 01:11.326
To an unscrupulous art dealer
who's trying to rob me blind.

01:11.326 --> 01:13.069
Last night, I was at a gallery opening, and

01:13.069 --> 01:15.251
Niles, is this going to be a long story?

01:15.251 --> 01:16.079
Moderately.

01:16.079 --> 01:19.174
Walk-and-talk.

01:19.174 --> 01:20.845
Anyway, I was at this opening, 
in conversation,

01:20.845 --> 01:24.139
when I made a rather emphatic 
point about pointillism,

01:24.139 --> 01:26.116
when I lost the grip on my canap and found that

01:26.116 --> 01:27.403
it became airborne!

01:27.403 --> 01:30.243
Well, the next thing I know 
I'm being confronted by

01:30.243 --> 01:31.973
an irate gallery owner who's demanding

01:31.973 --> 01:35.326
I reimburse him for the damage 
to one of his paintings!

01:35.326 --> 01:37.204
How he could notice a fleck of foie gras on a

01:37.204 --> 01:40.782
Jackson Pollock is beyond me.

01:40.782 --> 01:41.495
He's getting an estimate,

01:41.495 --> 01:42.423
and just to protect myself,

01:42.423 --> 01:44.924
I seem to recall you knowing a 
trustworthy art restorer?

01:44.924 --> 01:46.365
Oh yes, I do, actually.

01:46.365 --> 01:47.701
Saved my life last year when Eddie

01:47.701 --> 01:50.192
licked my Liechtenstein!

01:50.192 --> 01:50.965
I'll get you his card.

01:50.965 --> 01:53.424
Oh, thank you.

01:53.424 --> 01:54.333
You free for lunch today?

01:54.333 --> 01:55.680
Oh, sadly, no.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.008
The radio station is subjecting my program

01:58.008 --> 02:02.149
to something they call a 
"focus group" this afternoon.

02:02.149 --> 02:02.915
Dinner, perhaps?

02:02.915 --> 02:03.919
Oh, perfect.

02:03.919 --> 02:05.662
And what exactly is a focus group?

02:05.662 --> 02:09.071
Well, they actually drag a pack 
of people off the street and

02:09.071 --> 02:10.023
make them listen to my program,

02:10.023 --> 02:12.054
and then dutifully record 
their opinions about it.

02:12.054 --> 02:12.959
How demeaning!

02:12.959 --> 02:14.076
Oh, absolutely.

02:14.076 --> 02:15.575
Can you imagine Sigmund Freud being dragged

02:15.575 --> 02:17.908
into a roomful of Viennese 
laymen to hear remarks like,

02:17.908 --> 02:21.524
"hate that Oedipal thing, but, 
oh, love the penis envy!"

02:21.524 --> 02:23.598
I mean, really!

02:23.598 --> 02:25.007
The worst thing is that they may change

02:25.007 --> 02:28.619
my show in deference to the 
opinion of Joe Six-Pack!

02:28.619 --> 02:29.596
You're worrying too much.

02:29.596 --> 02:31.799
I was on a focus group once.

02:31.799 --> 02:38.045
That sound you hear is a nail 
being hammered into my coffin.

02:38.045 --> 02:39.945
They were trying out a new frozen snack.

02:39.945 --> 02:46.781
It was a meatball with the cheese 
injected right in the middle.

02:46.781 --> 02:53.835
Just as nature intended.

02:53.835 --> 02:56.182
Dr. Niles Crane.  Ah.

02:56.182 --> 02:58.988
So, you have the estimate?

02:58.988 --> 03:00.421
What?

03:00.421 --> 03:07.437
Four thousand dollars, to remove 
a miniscule gobbet of duck liver?!

03:07.437 --> 03:10.724
I could do the same thing with a
Q-tip and some club seltzer!

03:10.724 --> 03:12.774
Oh well, you may very well 
say "pay up or else,"

03:12.774 --> 03:15.428
but I have something to say to you?

03:15.428 --> 03:18.527
Yeah, well at least I wasn't 
fooling around with the babysitter!

03:18.527 --> 03:19.240
Shut up!

03:19.240 --> 03:20.776
No, you shut up!

03:20.776 --> 03:23.292
Oh please, I have enough aggravation 
without having to listen

03:23.292 --> 03:24.974
to a stupid talk show!

03:24.974 --> 03:27.308
I swear, the only life forms 
lower than the people

03:27.308 --> 03:30.586
who appear on those shows are 
the ones who watch them!

03:30.586 --> 03:31.659
Like me?

03:31.659 --> 03:32.634
What?

03:32.634 --> 03:34.236
Oh no, I didn't realize?

03:34.236 --> 03:36.805
No, no, no, that's quite all right.

03:36.805 --> 03:38.862
Although I do find it interesting that

03:38.862 --> 03:41.411
I get criticized for listening 
to people's problems,

03:41.411 --> 03:44.141
when all you do is get rich from it.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.550
Surely, Daphne, even you can see 
the difference between cheap

03:45.550 --> 03:48.399
sensationalism and the practice of psychiatry.

03:48.399 --> 03:50.508
Oh, "even me?"

03:50.508 --> 03:52.796
As in, "even feeble-minded Daphne?!"

03:52.796 --> 03:54.812
Well, I'll tell you what I can 
tell the difference between:

03:54.812 --> 03:57.837
a true gentleman and a condescending prig!

03:57.837 --> 04:00.659
I... am NOT!

04:00.659 --> 04:04.244
He said priggishly.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.381
Forgive me if I'm not as down to earth

04:06.381 --> 04:10.300
as you and your tattooed, muu-muu wearing brethren!

04:10.300 --> 04:11.685
You pompous twit!

04:11.685 --> 04:12.715
Couch zombie!

04:12.715 --> 04:13.659
Snob!

04:13.659 --> 04:14.290
Brat!

04:14.290 --> 04:15.042
Oh, shut up!

04:15.042 --> 04:16.841
No, YOU shut up!

04:16.841 --> 04:22.002
I'm glad we turned off the TV.

04:22.002 --> 04:25.012
Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so sorry!

04:25.012 --> 04:26.467
I'm just so upset at Joe!

04:26.467 --> 04:27.779
I didn't mean a word of it!

04:27.779 --> 04:28.603
Daphne, I apologize?

04:28.603 --> 04:30.961
Oh no, it was my fault?

04:30.961 --> 04:31.779
I called you a couch zombie?

04:31.779 --> 04:34.141
No, please?

04:34.141 --> 04:34.940
Friends?

04:34.940 --> 04:42.995
Oh, of course.

04:42.995 --> 04:44.800
Niles, what was that all about?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.594
I'm not sure.

04:45.594 --> 04:52.500
But, oh, mama, it was glorious!

04:52.500 --> 04:55.946
Blood-pounding, sarcastic zingers flying!

04:55.946 --> 04:58.259
Are you saying you that enjoyed 
fighting with Daphne?

04:58.259 --> 05:00.237
Every exhilarating moment!

05:00.237 --> 05:01.949
It was pure, unbridled passion!

05:01.949 --> 05:09.172
I think I still have some of her 
spittle on my forehead!

05:09.172 --> 05:12.060
Oh, why did Dad ever tell us 
not to fight with girls?

05:12.060 --> 05:14.292
It's wonderful!

05:14.292 --> 05:15.654
The friction between us?

05:15.654 --> 05:17.489
Niles, is this going to be a long description?

05:17.489 --> 05:18.281
Very!

05:18.281 --> 05:20.654
Walk-and-talk.

05:28.101 --> 05:30.153
By showering a reluctant girlfriend with gifts,

05:30.153 --> 05:33.425
Billy, you're applying a band-aid 
to a gaping wound.

05:33.425 --> 05:34.371
My advice is to find someone

05:34.371 --> 05:35.800
who will return your worthy affection,

05:35.800 --> 05:41.137
or your wallet, as well as your
bed, will be empty.

05:41.137 --> 05:42.210
I see we're out of time.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.251
Thank you for listening.

05:43.251 --> 05:48.020
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing 
you all good mental health.

05:48.020 --> 05:51.545
OK, let's talk about Dr. Crane's show.

05:51.545 --> 05:53.650
Oh, I know you've been eyeing this two-way mirror,

05:53.650 --> 05:56.131
but the other people behind 
there are data consultants,

05:56.131 --> 05:57.849
so please speak freely.

05:57.849 --> 06:00.340
There's no one involved with the 
show whose feelings could be hurt.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.771
If anybody says anything bad 
about me, I'll kill myself!

06:03.771 --> 06:04.931
Now, Roz, relax.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.072
We do a perfectly good show.

06:06.072 --> 06:07.864
We're not going to change it one iota.

06:07.864 --> 06:10.730
Only a fool would listen to the 
opinion of every Tom, Dick, and Harry.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.548
I liked everything about it.

06:12.548 --> 06:15.539
On the other hand, it's good 
to keep an open mind.

06:15.539 --> 06:16.771
I like that Roz.

06:16.771 --> 06:19.161
I think her voice is really sexy,

06:19.161 --> 06:21.804
especially that throaty laugh of hers.

06:21.804 --> 06:23.255
Wow, that's nice.

06:23.255 --> 06:25.359
I didn't know I had a throaty laugh.

06:25.359 --> 06:26.115
You do.

06:26.115 --> 06:27.715
I've noticed it too.

06:27.715 --> 06:35.192
Really? Oh, you.

06:35.192 --> 06:38.183
The stuff he says really seems 
to make a lot of sense.

06:38.183 --> 06:39.602
Yeah, it's funny.

06:39.602 --> 06:41.024
I mean, he takes his callers seriously,

06:41.024 --> 06:42.794
but he can kid around with them too.

06:42.794 --> 06:44.481
Yeah, I listen to a lot of radio,

06:44.481 --> 06:48.306
and I think this is a great show.

06:48.306 --> 06:53.110
Well, I just don't know how much 
more of this I can listen to!

06:53.110 --> 06:55.486
Manu, I notice you've been quiet.

06:55.486 --> 06:57.049
Uh, do you have something to say?

06:57.049 --> 07:00.585
Me?  No.

07:00.585 --> 07:03.878
We'd like to hear your opinion of the program.

07:03.878 --> 07:06.526
Well, it... I don't know.

07:06.526 --> 07:14.408
Something about... I don't like it.

07:14.408 --> 07:19.521
Well, who is this cheeky nonconformist?

07:19.521 --> 07:22.514
Well, let's see, his name is Manu Habib, married,

07:22.514 --> 07:25.296
no children, owns his own newsstand.

07:25.296 --> 07:29.865
Wow, that is so weird, to hear 
someone's whole life summed up like that.

07:29.865 --> 07:38.495
"Roz Doyle, Radio Producer, single."

07:38.495 --> 07:40.926
Well, getting back to your thoughts, Manu,

07:40.926 --> 07:43.533
you said there was something about 
the program you didn't like.

07:43.533 --> 07:47.713
Can you be more specific.

07:47.713 --> 07:51.703
I don't like him.

07:51.703 --> 07:53.168
Why?

07:53.168 --> 07:54.015
I don't know.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.205
I just don't like him.

07:56.205 --> 07:56.792
Oh, I do.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.102
I'm gonna start listening to him all the time.

07:58.102 --> 08:01.998
It's a great show.

08:01.998 --> 08:04.381
My God, Frasier, this is a love-fest!

08:04.381 --> 08:06.330
I can't believe we were even worried about it.

08:06.330 --> 08:10.467
"I just don't like him."  Hmm...

08:10.467 --> 08:11.612
Well, looks like our coffee's here.

08:11.612 --> 08:14.742
Why don't we take a quick break, OK?

08:14.742 --> 08:15.666
Hey, sports fans!

08:15.666 --> 08:16.741
How's it going in here?

08:16.741 --> 08:18.726
Bulldog, I thought they were 
testing your show across the hall?

08:18.726 --> 08:19.941
Oh, yeah, they are.

08:19.941 --> 08:22.306
But after ten minutes it's 
just the same-old, same-old.

08:22.306 --> 08:25.287
Guys love me, chicks pretend not to.

08:25.287 --> 08:29.875
Whoa, your group's even uglier than mine!

08:29.875 --> 08:30.940
Would you knock it off?

08:30.940 --> 08:32.083
These people happen to like us.

08:32.083 --> 08:32.950
Oh, will you guys lighten up?

08:32.950 --> 08:34.830
You got to get in the spirit of things.

08:34.830 --> 08:35.875
Hey, hey!

08:35.875 --> 08:40.453
This is great, I live for a moment like this.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.340
That's right, that's right,

08:41.340 --> 08:43.178
go for it, right there, right there.

08:43.178 --> 08:44.637
Bulldog?

08:44.637 --> 08:46.594
As long as you're in there 
you might as well go after the

08:46.594 --> 08:48.436
Huevos Rancheros you had for breakfast!

08:48.436 --> 08:49.652
Oh, stop it!

08:49.652 --> 08:51.659
Hey, ten bucks says he eats what he finds.

08:51.659 --> 08:52.531
Oh, that's disgusting!

08:52.531 --> 08:55.931
Come on, come on, come on, come o

08:55.931 --> 08:58.226
BINGO!

08:58.226 --> 09:03.024
Do I know these people or what?!

09:05.325 --> 09:05.833
Hi, Niles.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.178
Hey, Dad.

09:07.178 --> 09:09.217
May I assume from your dress windbreaker that

09:09.217 --> 09:11.988
you'll be joining us for dinner?

09:11.988 --> 09:14.546
Yep, but I'm making a pitch 
that we eat at the Timber Mill.

09:14.546 --> 09:16.995
I got a coupon from there that expires tomorrow.

09:16.995 --> 09:21.740
Oh.  If I dine there tonight, so may I.

09:21.740 --> 09:23.484
Hello, Dr. Crane.

09:23.484 --> 09:28.224
Oh, there's the British bobcat!

09:28.224 --> 09:29.498
Now, look, she's still a little bit over

09:29.498 --> 09:31.058
the edge about this Joe thing.

09:31.058 --> 09:32.507
So you better watch your step or you're gonna

09:32.507 --> 09:34.452
have a repeat of this morning.

09:34.452 --> 09:37.996
We wouldn't want that, would we?

09:37.996 --> 09:40.649
Chips, Daphne?  Was that wise?

09:40.649 --> 09:41.656
What do you mean?

09:41.656 --> 09:46.791
You know what they say, 
"many chips make for chunky hips."

09:46.791 --> 09:52.604
Waddle, waddle, waddle!

09:52.604 --> 09:53.937
Have you lost your mind?!

09:53.937 --> 09:57.089
Oh, no, no, I'm glad if I put on a few pounds.

09:57.089 --> 10:01.408
Now maybe Joe will stop 
nagging me to plump up!

10:01.408 --> 10:03.783
Hey, Fras, how was the focus group?

10:03.783 --> 10:05.321
Fine, I guess.

10:05.321 --> 10:08.207
Oh, well, you said yourself 
they didn't mean anything.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.481
Yes, well, it's one thing to say that.

10:09.481 --> 10:13.570
It's another to sit there 
being personally attacked!

10:13.570 --> 10:15.327
One man actually said,

10:15.327 --> 10:18.550
"I just don't like him."

10:18.550 --> 10:30.511
Only one?

10:30.511 --> 10:33.089
I'm sure someone must have said something nice.

10:33.089 --> 10:35.985
Well, all the other eleven had 
nothing but high praise.

10:35.985 --> 10:37.344
Eleven out of twelve liked you?

10:37.344 --> 10:38.560
You should be thrilled!

10:38.560 --> 10:41.050
F..DR didn't have that kind of approval rating.

10:41.050 --> 10:42.959
Yes, or Churchill for that matter.

10:42.959 --> 10:50.327
Churchill that cigar-chomping 
gin blossom with a face attached!

10:50.327 --> 10:51.623
You're right about that.

10:51.623 --> 10:58.192
There's a kiss hello to put you off your tea.

10:58.192 --> 11:00.217
I wish I was able to talk to 
this man and ask him what it is

11:00.217 --> 11:01.921
about me that he doesn't like.

11:01.921 --> 11:03.625
But, I-I can't, you see, he was told that

11:03.625 --> 11:05.656
his comments would be kept confidential.

11:05.656 --> 11:06.480
Just forget it.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.640
Come on, let's go out to dinner.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.297
I'm buying.

11:08.297 --> 11:10.161
Well, what is it he doesn't like about me?

11:10.161 --> 11:12.481
My voice, my manner, do I intimidate him?

11:12.481 --> 11:13.232
I don't know!

11:13.232 --> 11:14.239
What is it about you?

11:14.239 --> 11:15.769
Everybody has to love you!

11:15.769 --> 11:17.559
Just like when you were in 
that play in high school.

11:17.559 --> 11:19.265
You get standing ovations every night,

11:19.265 --> 11:20.831
all your friends say you're great,

11:20.831 --> 11:23.040
you got one lousy review in the school paper

11:23.040 --> 11:24.641
and you sulked for a week.

11:24.641 --> 11:26.650
Well, you know, Dad, I'd like to 
think I've matured a bit since then.

11:26.650 --> 11:27.809
But, you know, you would have sulked too,

11:27.809 --> 11:28.696
if you'd read in the paper,

11:28.696 --> 11:31.354
"Mr. Crane's attempts to gyrate
his hips as Conrad,

11:31.354 --> 11:33.848
the teen idol in 'Bye-Bye, Birdie,'
made this reviewer say,

11:33.848 --> 11:40.758
'Bye-bye, breakfast!'"

11:40.758 --> 11:49.735
That review was a mash note 
compared to my first draft.

11:49.735 --> 11:51.912
I know just what you're going through.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.391
I once won a dance competition hands down,

11:54.391 --> 11:57.146
but instead of celebrating I spent the whole night

11:57.146 --> 11:59.712
fretting over my one bad score.

11:59.712 --> 12:01.017
Silly-head!

12:01.017 --> 12:04.866
Idiot.

12:04.866 --> 12:08.695
Oh, I've stepped in it now!

12:08.695 --> 12:10.033
Listen here, Dr. Crane?

12:10.033 --> 12:11.297
Yeah, Daphne?

12:11.297 --> 12:14.296
All right now, Daphne, just a moment!

12:14.296 --> 12:16.402
Just try to remember what you're 
like when you're arguing with Joe.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.285
Consider Niles's situation.

12:17.285 --> 12:18.381
He's separated.

12:18.381 --> 12:20.662
You can't imagine the emotional see-saw he's on.

12:20.662 --> 12:22.374
Not to mention the fact that he may be unaware that

12:22.374 --> 12:25.735
he's acting like a complete jackass!

12:25.735 --> 12:27.321
Of course, you're right.

12:27.321 --> 12:29.591
I'm sorry, I should be more sensitive.

12:29.591 --> 12:41.628
From now on, nothing you say 
can make me cross with you.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.158
I suppose I had that coming.

12:44.158 --> 12:46.710
Though I think "jackass" was a tad over the line.

12:46.710 --> 12:51.501
Well, just consider it payback for 
the headline, "Crane's 'Birdie' Lays An Egg!"

12:51.501 --> 12:53.205
All right, now, Fras, you got to let it go.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.504
You know, no matter who you are,

12:54.504 --> 12:57.893
no matter what you do, you can't please everyone.

12:57.893 --> 13:02.245
I suppose my negative baggage is 
just a pound or two over the weight limit.

13:02.245 --> 13:05.193
O.K., good, come on, let's go have dinner.

13:05.193 --> 13:06.296
This is good!

13:06.296 --> 13:07.062
This is healthy!

13:07.062 --> 13:10.977
I'm letting go!

13:17.095 --> 13:21.102
There he is.

13:21.102 --> 13:24.478
The man who... doesn't like me.

13:24.478 --> 13:28.241
I knew we should have taken two cars.

13:34.324 --> 13:36.829
What the hell is the matter with you?

13:36.829 --> 13:37.478
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:37.478 --> 13:39.768
It's just that "I just don't like him,"

13:39.768 --> 13:42.763
it's not specific enough.

13:42.763 --> 13:43.852
Why doesn't he like me?

13:43.852 --> 13:45.390
What difference does it make?

13:45.390 --> 13:47.526
Well, if his point was valid, 
I would do something about it.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.878
If it's not, well, then I could dismiss it.

13:49.878 --> 13:51.171
Fine, go talk to him.

13:51.171 --> 13:51.974
I can't.

13:51.974 --> 13:55.310
He's not supposed to know I was
part of the focus group.

13:55.310 --> 13:58.454
You, Dad!  You could go talk to him for me.

13:58.454 --> 14:00.222
Oh, for crying out loud?

14:00.222 --> 14:04.132
Look, if we're going to be here for
a while, could we at least lock the doors?

14:04.132 --> 14:06.413
Relax, Niles, the neighborhood's O.K.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.414
The docks are two blocks from here!

14:08.414 --> 14:09.438
So's the Ritz-Carleton.

14:09.438 --> 14:14.084
Exactly!  We're caught halfway between heaven and hell.

14:14.084 --> 14:15.821
All I want is more information.

14:15.821 --> 14:18.334
Dad, please?  Please go talk to him for me?

14:18.334 --> 14:20.766
All right, if I get an answer 
for you, can we go to dinner?

14:20.766 --> 14:21.841
O.K., fine.

14:21.841 --> 14:23.464
Oh, but wait, wait, wait!

14:23.464 --> 14:25.173
Now you can't just walk up there and ask him.

14:25.173 --> 14:27.024
He'll know that I sent you.

14:27.024 --> 14:30.385
Got to find some artful way of 
introducing the subject.

14:30.385 --> 14:33.432
Can we at least hide Dad's handicapped sign?

14:33.432 --> 14:36.115
It sends a clear signal that we're 
incapable of fighting back!

14:36.115 --> 14:39.149
So do your suspenders.

14:39.149 --> 14:40.190
All right, I've got it, I've got it.

14:40.190 --> 14:42.078
You're a business man in town from Chicago.

14:42.078 --> 14:43.235
No, no, it's too obvious.

14:43.235 --> 14:44.843
Uh, from Cleveland.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.332
No would ever pretend to be from Cleveland.

14:46.332 --> 14:47.524
Fine, then we eat.

14:47.524 --> 14:49.349
Wait, wait, we're not through yet!

14:49.349 --> 14:52.004
Yes, you've had a bad sales month,
and you're a little depressed.

14:52.004 --> 14:54.347
You happen to see an add for my 
show on the side of a bus,

14:54.347 --> 14:57.133
and you were wondering if I'm 
as intelligent as I look.

14:57.133 --> 14:57.746
What?

14:57.746 --> 14:59.341
Oh, just word it your own way.

14:59.341 --> 15:01.428
Are we clear on this now?

15:01.428 --> 15:02.274
All right, I got it.

15:02.274 --> 15:06.179
Businessman, Cleveland, depressed,  then eat!

15:06.179 --> 15:08.044
Yes, Dad, eat!

15:08.044 --> 15:12.678
Honestly, sometimes you can get
so obsessed about things!

15:12.678 --> 15:17.106
Oh, God, it's raining!

15:20.301 --> 15:21.155
Hi, I'm Marty Crane.

15:21.155 --> 15:22.732
My son's Dr. Frasier Crane.

15:22.732 --> 15:24.586
He's across the street in that BMW.

15:24.586 --> 15:26.876
No, don't look!

15:26.876 --> 15:28.094
Oh, my God.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.565
He was behind the mirror.

15:29.565 --> 15:30.451
Look, don't worry about it.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.492
He's not mad at you.

15:31.492 --> 15:33.426
He just want to know why you don't like him.

15:33.426 --> 15:35.335
But I do like him.

15:35.335 --> 15:35.873
No, you don't.

15:35.873 --> 15:37.489
Oh, yes, I do!

15:37.489 --> 15:39.206
No, he heard what you said.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.493
They lied to me.

15:40.493 --> 15:46.305
They lied about.. They lied about the
mirror, they lied about the free gift.

15:46.305 --> 15:51.430
If that's a tod back, what the hell is
funny pack

15:51.430 --> 15:56.504
Look, I just need you to be more specific
What don't you like him about.

15:56.504 --> 15:57.476
I can't do this.

15:57.476 --> 16:01.171
I don't like to say bad things 
about people, and you are his father?

16:01.171 --> 16:02.422
No, you'd be doing me a favor!

16:02.422 --> 16:04.110
Just answer this one question,

16:04.110 --> 16:06.655
and we'll all get out of your life forever.

16:06.655 --> 16:07.714
you're promising?

16:07.714 --> 16:10.017
Absolutely.

16:10.017 --> 16:11.869
All right.

16:11.869 --> 16:13.986
I-I don't know your son well.

16:13.986 --> 16:21.357
But, uh, I guess I find him, uh,
just a little bit... annoying.

16:21.357 --> 16:22.279
Yeah?

16:22.279 --> 16:24.106
Annoying.

16:24.106 --> 16:25.216
O.K.  You did good.

16:25.216 --> 16:26.361
Thanks.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.796
Please tell your son I'm sorry 
that he annoys me so much.

16:29.796 --> 16:33.469
Will do.

16:33.469 --> 16:36.007
Not yet... not yet... not yet.

16:36.007 --> 16:43.336
OK, unlock!

16:43.336 --> 16:46.334
And lock!

16:46.334 --> 16:47.304
Mission accomplished.

16:47.304 --> 16:47.910
Good.

16:47.910 --> 16:48.632
Did he believe my story?

16:48.632 --> 16:50.271
Oh, yeah, I had him going pretty good.

16:50.271 --> 16:53.042
That Cleveland thing really sold it.

16:53.042 --> 16:54.511
Well, we better go eat now, huh?

16:54.511 --> 16:55.351
Before he sees us again.

16:55.351 --> 16:57.009
Right.

16:57.009 --> 16:59.344
So, uh, Dad, what doesn't he like about me?

16:59.344 --> 17:01.408
He said you annoy him.

17:01.408 --> 17:03.528
Yes, how so?

17:03.528 --> 17:04.695
Well, I didn't ask him.

17:04.695 --> 17:06.601
What do you mean you didn't ask him?

17:06.601 --> 17:07.608
Oh, geez!

17:07.608 --> 17:10.117
I'm sorry, Dad, but I have no idea 
what "he's annoying" means!

17:10.117 --> 17:13.997
Well, it's clear enough to me!

17:13.997 --> 17:19.753
Frasier, not to appear unsympathetic but
I had my i'm dangerous space on so long
it's starting to hurt.

17:19.753 --> 17:21.974
oh, what is about me he couldn't find
so annoying.

17:21.974 --> 17:27.117
well, he mentioned something about
not letting old man to eat!

17:27.117 --> 17:30.775
I'm just going to have to do this myself!

17:30.775 --> 17:31.254
Here.

17:31.254 --> 17:33.929
Thank you.

17:33.929 --> 17:34.749
Who're you calling?

17:34.749 --> 17:35.584
No one.

17:35.584 --> 17:37.976
I just pressed 911, and I'm keeping 
my finger poised

17:37.976 --> 17:40.418
over the Send button in case there's
trouble with those hooligans.

17:40.418 --> 17:44.147
Oh, the UPS men or the little girls
playing in the puddle?

17:46.942 --> 17:47.493
Hello.

17:47.493 --> 17:49.390
Hello.

17:49.390 --> 17:50.463
I can help you?

17:50.463 --> 17:57.029
Uh, yes, yes, you were recently 
speaking with a salesman from Cleveland.

17:57.029 --> 17:58.440
I don't think so.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.958
It was just five minutes ago.

17:59.958 --> 18:03.031
He left you and went over to that 
car waiting right over there.

18:03.031 --> 18:05.557
You see?

18:05.557 --> 18:06.373
Oh, God, no.

18:06.373 --> 18:07.704
You're him, it's you.

18:07.704 --> 18:08.565
Yes, yes, it is.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.382
I'm so sorry, I really don't mean to bother you

18:10.382 --> 18:13.100
but I would like to talk to you for a minute.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.232
I like your show.

18:14.232 --> 18:15.078
Oh, no.

18:15.078 --> 18:18.991
I like your show, and I like you.

18:18.991 --> 18:19.772
That man was my father

18:19.772 --> 18:21.862
I like your father!

18:21.862 --> 18:23.271
Oh, that's very nice of you,
but you see, you told him that,

18:23.271 --> 18:25.115
uh, you find me annoying.

18:25.115 --> 18:26.861
Yes, yes, you did, and that's all right.

18:26.861 --> 18:28.460
I don't mind constructive criticism.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.495
It's just that I wish you could 
be a bit more specific.

18:30.495 --> 18:32.879
What exactly is it about me that 
you find so annoying?

18:32.879 --> 18:33.718
You're not annoying.

18:33.718 --> 18:35.757
Yes, I am!

18:35.757 --> 18:36.902
Would I be here if I wasn't?

18:36.902 --> 18:38.810
Well, I have enjoyed talking to you very much,

18:38.810 --> 18:40.335
but it's time for my break.

18:40.335 --> 18:44.597
Oh, no, no, please!

18:44.597 --> 18:46.891
I'm so sorry.

18:46.891 --> 18:48.767
I am a sticky mess.

18:48.767 --> 18:50.151
Let me help you with that.

18:50.151 --> 18:52.966
No, no, no, no, it's fine, good.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.117
Manu?

18:54.117 --> 18:57.915
Drive safe.

18:57.915 --> 18:59.068
Oh, dear God!

18:59.068 --> 19:00.174
I'm so sorry!

19:00.174 --> 19:01.804
Are you all right?

19:01.804 --> 19:03.675
Let me look at it, let me look at it?

19:03.675 --> 19:04.365
No, no!

19:04.365 --> 19:04.934
Look, I am a doctor.

19:04.934 --> 19:06.628
No, no, I just go to the restaurant to put ice on it.

19:06.628 --> 19:10.207
Right, you know, I'll hold down the fort here!

19:10.207 --> 19:13.771
Glad to be of help!

19:13.771 --> 19:15.909
He's crushed the gentleman's hand, and now

19:15.909 --> 19:19.604
he appears to be commandeering his newsstand.

19:19.604 --> 19:23.860
Uh-huh.

19:23.860 --> 19:24.773
Oh, good lord.

19:24.773 --> 19:29.010
Smoking in the worst places!

19:29.010 --> 19:29.820
How much for the paper?

19:29.820 --> 19:32.812
Ah, yes, uh, well, that would be

19:32.812 --> 19:35.614
oh, fifty cents.

19:35.614 --> 19:37.086
Thank you so much.  There we are.

19:37.086 --> 19:40.260
Scuse me, are you Dr. Crane from the radio?

19:40.260 --> 19:41.371
Why, yes, I am.

19:41.371 --> 19:43.555
Oh, I just never miss your show!

19:43.555 --> 19:44.485
I love you!

19:44.485 --> 19:46.099
I guess you get tired of hearing that.

19:46.099 --> 19:50.022
Oh, occupational hazard.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.077
Oh, would you mind?

19:51.077 --> 19:53.260
Oh, I wouldn't mind at all.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.013
To Amanda.

19:54.013 --> 19:57.269
Amanda, it's a pleasure.

19:57.269 --> 19:59.356
What are you doing here, anyway?

19:59.356 --> 20:02.871
Oh, oh, well you see, let me explain, you see.

20:02.871 --> 20:08.106
The, uh, radio station conducted
a little audio survey today,

20:08.106 --> 20:10.732
and although the response was favorable

20:10.732 --> 20:12.659
from eleven out of twelve of the participants?

20:12.659 --> 20:13.417
Is that smoking?

20:13.417 --> 20:15.524
Well, some people might consider it smoking,

20:15.524 --> 20:16.755
but you see, for me?

20:16.755 --> 20:18.265
FIRE!

20:18.265 --> 20:20.934
Oh, my God!

20:28.707 --> 20:33.101
oh my god
Frasier set his newsstand on fire.

20:33.101 --> 20:37.928
Mmm-hmm.

20:54.396 --> 21:02.131
Uh, may I?

21:02.131 --> 21:03.700
Look, I know there's nothing

21:03.700 --> 21:05.541
I can say right now that would 
make you feel any better,

21:05.541 --> 21:12.601
but rest assured, I will be financially
responsible for everything.

21:12.601 --> 21:18.033
All this because you had to know 
why I do not like you.

21:18.033 --> 21:20.902
Well, you were kind of vague.

21:20.902 --> 21:22.490
You want to know why?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.074
I'll tell you why.

21:24.074 --> 21:28.404
I think you are a smarty-pants.

21:28.404 --> 21:30.435
I was too polite to say that before.

21:30.435 --> 21:35.508
But then you spied on me, you stalked
me, you badgered me, you poured

21:35.508 --> 21:39.178
Yoo-Hoo down my Dockers, you 
crunched my hand, and then, as

21:39.178 --> 21:43.370
if all that was not enough, you 
burned down my newsstand,

21:43.370 --> 21:51.050
my livelihood, a gift to me from my 
beloved uncle, may he rest in peace!

21:51.050 --> 22:03.930
Was that so hard?

22:03.930 --> 22:06.192
