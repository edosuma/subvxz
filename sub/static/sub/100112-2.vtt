WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:05.079
- Hey!
- Hey, Dad.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.279
Hey, Dad.

00:06.280 --> 00:08.309
You coming with us to visit
Becky at the hospital?

00:08.310 --> 00:09.959
No, I can't. I'm on a break from work,

00:09.960 --> 00:12.119
but I got something for Becky,
if you'd give it to her.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.979
The store sells this really great

00:13.980 --> 00:16.517
Lanolin cocoa butter for stretch marks.

00:17.980 --> 00:19.269
Wow, that's sweet.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.599
After all she's been through,
it's nice to remind her

00:21.600 --> 00:23.519
she's all stretched out.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.639
I looked in our baby section.

00:25.640 --> 00:28.194
It was either that or something
for cracked nipples.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.947
They crack?

00:31.880 --> 00:34.669
I gotta go. My manager's
in a terrible mood.

00:34.670 --> 00:36.703
He tanked his SATs.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.989
Bye.

00:37.990 --> 00:40.019
If Becky's getting
something, we should bring

00:40.020 --> 00:41.479
something for Lil Bev.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.279
- Like a stuffed animal.
- Mm-hmm.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.779
I don't know. It's a preemie.

00:44.780 --> 00:46.279
A Beanie Baby that's
bigger than your kid...

00:46.280 --> 00:48.699
that's gonna be depressing.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.439
Darlene, it's your phone.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.679
It's Mark's school.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.769
Wow!

00:55.770 --> 00:57.689
Are you in trouble,
or does the pink-eye girl

00:57.690 --> 00:59.184
have lice now?

01:01.820 --> 01:03.319
Hello?

01:03.320 --> 01:05.357
Uh, hi, Principal Reynolds. How are you?

01:05.358 --> 01:07.400
Oh.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.309
Uh-huh.

01:10.310 --> 01:12.156
Okay, that's... that's not good.

01:12.157 --> 01:15.359
Um, yeah. We'll be there.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.760
What's he in trouble for?

01:16.770 --> 01:20.288
Spreading too much sunshine
everywhere he goes?

01:20.289 --> 01:23.167
Why don't you guys head out to
the car and give us a second?

01:24.940 --> 01:27.919
So, we have to go see
the principal tomorrow

01:27.920 --> 01:30.639
because your school has a "no PDA" rule

01:30.640 --> 01:32.929
and somebody posted a
picture of you kissing

01:32.930 --> 01:35.169
your friend Austin at school.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.869
He wins at everything,
and now he has a boyfriend?

01:37.870 --> 01:38.880
I hate you!

01:40.880 --> 01:43.339
So, Austin's your boyfriend?

01:43.340 --> 01:44.897
How come you didn't tell me?

01:44.898 --> 01:47.919
I don't know. I guess he's my boyfriend.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.799
When we found out they
were gonna start serving

01:49.800 --> 01:51.019
personal pizzas at lunch,

01:51.020 --> 01:53.020
we got so excited that we kissed.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.670
I get that.

01:57.701 --> 02:01.219
Well, there is a longer talk to come,

02:01.220 --> 02:04.123
but have you guys done
anything more than kiss?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.699
No, just the kiss.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.439
And that was the first time.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.378
He only told me he was gay last week.

02:09.380 --> 02:12.039
Is Austin the dark, brooding one

02:12.040 --> 02:15.419
or the kid that's always
smelling his hand?

02:15.420 --> 02:16.960
Neither, Grandpa.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.339
All right, well, we'll
deal with this tomorrow,

02:19.340 --> 02:21.519
but in the meantime, no more PDA.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.559
You're at school to
learn, not kiss, okay?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.240
Got it.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.608
So, you think you're ready for
a relationship, huh, pal?

02:30.609 --> 02:33.237
I think so. Is there
anything I should know?

02:33.238 --> 02:37.519
I'll just say, you're 12,
don't sign anything,

02:37.520 --> 02:40.368
and just treat him the way you'd
want to be treated, I guess.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.495
Austin says I don't listen enough.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.369
Does he also say you drink too much?

02:44.370 --> 02:45.749
'Cause that's coming.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.962
How are we doing?

02:50.963 --> 02:54.580
I've been trying to pump every
couple hours, but nothing.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.239
I've always been able
to count on my boobs,

02:57.240 --> 02:58.840
but they're betraying me.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.515
Have you tried to express
the milk by hand?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.749
Are you kidding?

03:03.750 --> 03:07.687
I've been squeezing myself
like an entitled frat boy.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.189
It takes some people longer.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.733
Everything'll be okay.

03:11.734 --> 03:15.499
As Becky's life and birth coach,

03:15.500 --> 03:17.159
um, I need to inform you

03:17.160 --> 03:20.199
that your constant
reductive reassurances

03:20.200 --> 03:21.699
are not appreciated.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.519
She understands that the
milk contains colostrum,

03:24.520 --> 03:26.080
which carries the antibodies

03:26.081 --> 03:28.109
that preemies need to fight disease.

03:28.110 --> 03:30.019
She knows that she's playing
with the baby's life.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.960
So just let her be, could ya?

03:33.200 --> 03:35.210
I got your back.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.219
Hey.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.099
Hey! Did you see the baby?

03:42.100 --> 03:45.390
- Oh, yeah. Strong.
- She looks beautiful!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.599
Don't sugarcoat it.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.646
I've seen her. You can be honest.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.359
Okay, well, I've seen cuter
babies in jars at the fair.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.069
It's okay. Babies don't
always start out pretty.

03:58.070 --> 04:01.169
Darlene looked like Yoda.
You had Dumbo ears.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.320
And DJ...

04:03.260 --> 04:04.779
DJ did start out pretty,

04:04.780 --> 04:07.700
so... be careful what you wish for.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.739
Hey, Beck, you know,
you've been up for two nights.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.819
It's hard to make milk when
you're tired and stressed.

04:13.820 --> 04:14.829
You need to sleep.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.279
Geena's hospital...
they had a lactation specialist.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.507
Maybe you can get one of those.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.678
This is County.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.304
People pay their bills
here with chickens.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.597
We have chickens!

04:24.598 --> 04:27.269
You don't have chickens.

04:27.270 --> 04:29.186
I have chickens.

"The Conners" is recorded

05:09.000 --> 05:10.819
in front of a live studio audience.

05:10.820 --> 05:12.359
Darlene, I need to tell you something.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.880
What?

05:17.700 --> 05:19.259
What'd you need to tell me?

05:19.260 --> 05:20.654
That.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.379
Get back upstairs.

05:23.380 --> 05:24.867
That could be my dad or the kids.

05:26.120 --> 05:30.120
Mm, did I hear David?

05:31.580 --> 05:34.709
Yes. He slept over last night.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.359
Again? Oh, you're taking
some chances here.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.399
If the kids find out and tell Ben,

05:39.400 --> 05:41.990
your little sausage party is over.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.249
It's okay.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.199
We're quiet, and he knows
to stay in my room

05:49.200 --> 05:51.010
until my dad and the kids are gone.

05:55.220 --> 05:57.020
Oh, crap! It's Ben!

05:58.880 --> 06:01.340
Ben!

06:02.571 --> 06:05.032
Hey, uh, what... what the...
what are you doing here?

06:05.033 --> 06:06.799
Oh. That's funny.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.369
In my head, you just said, "Hey, Ben,

06:08.370 --> 06:10.529
what a pleasant surprise."

06:10.530 --> 06:13.099
I'm sorry. I-I just
didn't ex-expect you.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.019
We're just about to leave
for the ho... for...

06:15.020 --> 06:16.319
So, thanks for coming!

06:16.320 --> 06:17.469
Thanks for the deli platter!

06:17.470 --> 06:20.129
Oh, wow. Wait, are you
rushing me out, or...

06:20.130 --> 06:23.132
No. Of course not.
Of course not. Come on in.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.230
Okay.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.389
Okay, say what you need to say.

06:34.390 --> 06:36.099
I was just in the neighborhood,

06:36.100 --> 06:37.939
and I thought you might like this

06:37.940 --> 06:40.639
'cause you probably don't have
time for cooking right now.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.519
And, uh, it's, uh...

06:43.520 --> 06:47.439
it's half vegan and... half delicious.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.039
Okay. Thank you! Kiss me and go!

06:51.040 --> 06:52.787
Okay.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.709
Wow, it's like "Casablanca."

06:56.208 --> 06:58.619
You, sir, have besmirched me daughter!

06:58.620 --> 07:00.119
Now you must marry her!

07:01.450 --> 07:04.400
And I accept your cold-cut dowry.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.927
Dan, shouldn't you be at work?

07:07.928 --> 07:12.429
Oh, one of my crew guys peed on
some wires and we lost power.

07:12.430 --> 07:14.089
Blew him right out of his shoes.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.879
How you doing, Dan?

07:16.880 --> 07:19.522
Uh, he's great. Everything's great.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.316
Apparently, I'm great.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.739
All right, let's say
goodbye on the porch.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.020
It's on my way to seeing Becky.

07:32.510 --> 07:36.839
So, you know, the other day,
I-I told you that I thought

07:36.840 --> 07:38.499
you seemed stressed by the commute,

07:38.500 --> 07:41.699
but you seem just real anxious to me.

07:41.700 --> 07:46.500
Um, have you ever considered
talking to a therapist?

07:47.360 --> 07:49.259
Well, I have all that discretionary

07:49.260 --> 07:51.429
income lying around.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.473
Maybe I'll try therapy after
that Tuscan wine safari.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.359
Oh, come on.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.060
Most therapists charge
on a sliding scale.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.509
Something to think about.

08:00.510 --> 08:01.897
Bye, love-you-miss-you-mean-it.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.030
Oh.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.980
Yeah. Maybe twice a week to start.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.909
Look, Darlene. It's David.

08:16.910 --> 08:20.790
David, you can't be down here
like that. My dad's home.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.586
If he sees you in that robe,
he's gonna know we had sex.

08:22.587 --> 08:24.319
Sorry, I'm just washing some clothes.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.699
And I saw your father go in the
garage with a platter of meat.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.759
He's not coming out till spring.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.578
No, no, it's... it's half vegan.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.639
We've got like two minutes
until he hits broccoli

08:34.640 --> 08:36.380
and comes screaming out of there.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.558
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.779
Get dressed. Now.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.330
But they're wet.

08:46.580 --> 08:50.479
Aah, and they're cold.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.480
Oh, yeah, I'm stuck.

08:51.481 --> 08:53.919
I'll help. You take left.
I'll take right.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.659
Okay. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.871
Wait. Just a... Let me do it.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.624
You don't know where everything goes.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.929
Okay, go. All right,
love you, and I'll see you

09:04.930 --> 09:06.179
at the principal's office at 4:00.

09:06.180 --> 09:07.830
- Don't forget. Bye.
- Yeah.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.019
You can't make me feel
worse about myself

09:17.020 --> 09:18.141
than I already feel right now.

09:18.142 --> 09:21.186
At least let me try.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.859
Look, I know it's wrong,

09:23.860 --> 09:26.639
but I-I love David and I love Ben.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.199
And I have to decide who I'm gonna spend

09:28.200 --> 09:30.109
the rest of my life with.

09:30.110 --> 09:33.239
Well, let's talk about it,
and maybe I can help you.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.825
Pick Ben.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.640
Ben challenges you.
He's financially stable.

09:39.650 --> 09:41.359
He'll be a fantastic partner.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.369
David is sweet, but you've
already gone down that road.

09:45.370 --> 09:48.339
But he's the father of my children,

09:48.340 --> 09:51.133
and he's really stepping
up and showing up for us.

09:51.134 --> 09:56.479
So buy him a "Number One Dad"
t-shirt as a parting gift,

09:56.480 --> 09:58.379
and then you go be with Ben.

09:58.380 --> 10:02.239
And the sex has gotta be fantastic.

10:02.240 --> 10:07.482
Get to... Get to rub that
beard all over your body.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.609
David is familiar and
soft and, you know,

10:18.610 --> 10:20.599
having sex with him is
like being with a nice,

10:20.600 --> 10:23.399
fluffy marshmallow.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.689
David has a beard.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.620
Mm, does he, though?

10:30.710 --> 10:33.059
Is Austin's mother going to join us?

10:33.060 --> 10:35.129
Well, she hasn't joined
us in eight years,

10:35.130 --> 10:37.220
so the odds are against it.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.659
Can we get this going?

10:39.660 --> 10:41.859
Yeah, I think we can take care
of this in a couple minutes.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.018
This whole thing's crazy.

10:43.019 --> 10:45.640
I'd just like to make an...
an opening statement.

10:45.650 --> 10:50.109
Um, well, as Mark's father,
I-I'm no longer taking

10:50.110 --> 10:53.199
a-a sidelines position
on his upbringing.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.323
I-I am now fully in the picture,
and... and as such,

10:57.324 --> 11:00.952
uh, I, too, think this
whole thing's crazy.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.779
I'm sorry, but we have rules

11:03.780 --> 11:05.959
about public displays of affection.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.959
Mark and Austin are getting
three days detention.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.359
What?! Is this because they're two boys?

11:11.360 --> 11:13.479
Because when I was here,
kids kissed all the time.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.919
My sister, Becky, kissed her teacher,

11:14.920 --> 11:16.843
and she didn't get detention.
She got an "A."

11:19.012 --> 11:21.597
We don't differentiate
on the basis of gender.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.739
Well, you're not punishing my grandson.

11:23.740 --> 11:26.685
Austin doesn't kiss boys.
Mark kissed him.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.147
Well, that's not what I heard.
Is that what Austin told you?

11:29.148 --> 11:30.149
Yes.

11:30.150 --> 11:32.349
That's not what happened.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.699
Yes, it is. I was just
in line for pizza,

11:34.700 --> 11:36.729
and you came up and kissed me.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.219
That's not true.

11:38.220 --> 11:40.089
Uh, Mark doesn't lie.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.929
That's not how he was raised.

11:41.930 --> 11:45.162
I-I wasn't there for a lot
of it, but I'm pretty sure.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.959
Who are you gonna believe?

11:46.960 --> 11:50.069
My kid or the boy with the nail polish?

11:50.070 --> 11:53.339
Hey, wearing nail polish
doesn't make you a liar.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.379
Now, Austin, I know this is hard,

11:55.380 --> 11:58.092
but you just got to tell the truth.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.679
Don't talk to him.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.089
I am telling the truth.

12:02.090 --> 12:04.640
No, you're not.

12:04.650 --> 12:06.642
Y-You said you liked me.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.227
Well, I don't.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.106
Austin, wait outside.

12:13.890 --> 12:16.309
You raise your kid however you want,

12:16.310 --> 12:18.859
but I've got enough on my plate
raising Austin by myself.

12:18.860 --> 12:20.829
I don't need your kid confusing him

12:20.830 --> 12:22.325
into thinking he's something he isn't!

12:22.326 --> 12:24.719
Hey, you know what?
It's not contagious, lady.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.839
Your kid's not gonna catch
being gay any more than

12:26.840 --> 12:29.708
he's gonna catch being a
cranky, old wench like you.

12:31.700 --> 12:32.909
I don't need to listen to this.

12:32.910 --> 12:34.539
No, yes, you do.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.279
Maybe you don't want to accept the fact

12:36.280 --> 12:38.179
that your grandkid might be gay,

12:38.180 --> 12:40.379
but you scaring him into denying it

12:40.380 --> 12:42.137
is just gonna ruin his life.

12:42.138 --> 12:46.969
Well, this feels like a
natural stopping point.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.219
Oh, maybe you can take
the progress you've made

12:49.220 --> 12:51.103
and continue over coffee somewhere.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.799
No, we're not going for coffee.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.899
We're very angry right now!

12:54.900 --> 12:55.941
Unless you wanted coffee.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.777
- No, I don't.
- Do you want... She doesn't!

13:08.120 --> 13:10.330
Hey, buddy.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.519
You ready to talk?

13:14.520 --> 13:17.588
Principal called.
No one's getting detention.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.716
Okay.

13:22.170 --> 13:23.761
Going for a new color?

13:23.762 --> 13:27.014
Nope. I'm not gonna wear
nail polish anymore.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.557
How come?

13:28.558 --> 13:31.394
Just tired of it. That's all.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.230
Today was, uh, really bad, huh?

13:35.231 --> 13:38.119
I can't believe Austin
said those things.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.110
He won't even talk to me now.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.179
Well, you know that's
because of his grandmother,

13:42.180 --> 13:43.329
not because of you.

13:43.330 --> 13:45.410
Yeah, and his grandma's old.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.779
I heard her coughing in the hallway.

13:49.780 --> 13:50.999
One more bad flu season,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.240
and you guys are back together again.

13:56.340 --> 13:58.309
Hey, don't be mad at Austin.

13:58.310 --> 14:00.381
He's caught in a really bad situation.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.979
I don't care. I am mad at him.

14:02.980 --> 14:04.177
And I'm mad at you.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.359
What? Why?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.159
You told me I shouldn't hide who I am,

14:08.160 --> 14:09.765
and look what happened.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.519
Yeah, but you shouldn't
hide who you are.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.599
Austin has to do that.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.686
You don't wanna live like that, right?

14:14.687 --> 14:18.023
My life would be so much
easier if I wasn't gay.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.129
Hey, stop it.

14:20.130 --> 14:23.099
This is not your problem.
This is their problem.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.919
Forget what I said about not being mad.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.699
Austin's a jerk for turning on you,

14:26.700 --> 14:29.039
and his grandma's a jerk
for not caring how much

14:29.040 --> 14:30.577
she's hurting the two of you.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.663
You should be mad,
and you should stay mad

14:32.664 --> 14:35.500
'cause you're amazing and
everybody else sucks!

14:36.940 --> 14:39.999
Is liking someone always
gonna be this hard?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.479
Oh, you mean falling in love?

14:42.480 --> 14:45.089
Yeah, love is freakin' brutal.

14:45.090 --> 14:46.319
I mean, just take your dad.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.459
I thought he was my soul mate,

14:47.460 --> 14:50.431
and then he left for nine years.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.659
There's probably other examples.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.939
Yeah, but it's a good one.

14:54.940 --> 14:56.809
All right.

14:56.810 --> 14:58.519
I-I think we may have gotten off topic.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.869
W-What's important is
that someone wonderful

15:02.870 --> 15:04.599
will eventually come along.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.739
You know, I-I-I think the
hard part is that you know

15:07.740 --> 15:10.509
who you are at a very early age.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.649
And that's great.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.219
But until the other kids catch up,

15:14.220 --> 15:15.706
it might be a little lonely.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.499
Well, what do I do until then?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.759
Well, that is where you're lucky

15:19.760 --> 15:23.000
because you have a really fun family!

15:24.260 --> 15:26.759
Get off me, you weirdos!

15:26.760 --> 15:28.093
No!

15:28.094 --> 15:29.859
Do you feel better now?

15:29.860 --> 15:31.359
Yes, I love myself!

15:31.360 --> 15:32.590
I'm glad I'm gay!

15:32.599 --> 15:33.669
Leave me alone!

15:43.980 --> 15:46.040
We did it!

15:46.080 --> 15:47.619
We did it!

15:47.620 --> 15:49.099
Nice job, lefty!

15:49.100 --> 15:51.300
You were always my favorite!

15:52.540 --> 15:54.230
Nurse!

16:02.840 --> 16:04.309
Wow!

16:04.310 --> 16:06.109
Yeah, poor Mark, huh?

16:06.110 --> 16:07.599
No, I'm talking about us.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.420
We just parented the
crap out of that kid.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.389
- Yeah, we did.
- Mm-hmm.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.389
We are kicking ass as parents.

16:16.390 --> 16:19.759
We're having great sex.
And we love each other.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.859
Let's go tell the kids we're
getting back together tonight.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.483
I know it'll cheer Mark up.

16:23.484 --> 16:25.640
Um, it's still too soon.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.419
Look we just told Mark
not to live a lie,

16:30.420 --> 16:33.209
and here we are sneaking and
hiding from our own family.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.660
This has gotta stop.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.039
Well, we're still working
on our relationship.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.706
You know, just don't
get ahead of yourself.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.119
If... If there's a reason

16:40.120 --> 16:41.619
we can't be back together, then say it.

16:41.620 --> 16:44.460
Otherwise, I want a decision now.

16:45.220 --> 16:47.659
Okay, um, all right.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.580
Uh, here we go.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.279
Um, there's something
I have to tell you.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.767
I-I... You need to go to therapy.

16:59.260 --> 17:00.599
Therapy? I...

17:00.600 --> 17:02.312
I thought we were doing great.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.769
No, I-I... Think about it.
It... It makes sense.

17:04.770 --> 17:07.509
I mean, we have issues.
We're on again, off again.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.529
You need professional help.

17:10.380 --> 17:13.825
Okay. I'll do whatever it
takes for us to be together.

17:13.826 --> 17:16.993
- Great.
- Well, you have to go, too.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.246
I'd rather not.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.999
If you don't go, I don't go,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.559
and we tell the kids
everything right now.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.710
Okay, fine. I-I'll go.

17:25.859 --> 17:27.279
Okay.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.059
I feel really good about this.

17:29.060 --> 17:30.300
Heck, yeah, you do.

17:32.210 --> 17:36.849
So... when you and David finish therapy

17:36.850 --> 17:40.889
and he moves in with you and Ben...

17:40.890 --> 17:43.339
are you and the rest of the Mormons

17:43.340 --> 17:45.815
gonna raise a barn in the backyard?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.401
You know what?

17:49.402 --> 17:50.949
I may have been forced into this,

17:50.950 --> 17:53.159
but it's probably the only way I'll know

17:53.160 --> 17:55.259
if David and I have a
chance of making this work.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.389
Yeah, here's the other
thing that's gonna happen.

17:57.390 --> 18:01.239
Um, after about three sessions,
that therapist is gonna know

18:01.240 --> 18:03.379
that you're lying your ass
off, and what you're doing

18:03.380 --> 18:05.959
is gonna be totally exposed to David.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.499
Huh.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.399
Well, that's not good.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.259
Well, maybe it'll at least
just buy me enough time

18:13.260 --> 18:16.069
to figure out which man
I'm gonna love forever

18:16.070 --> 18:18.539
and which man is never
gonna trust women again

18:18.540 --> 18:21.009
and probably die alone.

18:21.010 --> 18:24.679
Are you saying that if you pick David,

18:24.680 --> 18:26.099
Ben will die alone?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.519
Because I'm here to tell you
that there are a lot of women

18:28.520 --> 18:32.819
who would shamelessly throw
themselves at a guy like that.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.599
Just stop. It's not funny anymore.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.865
It's just creepy.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.119
You know what they say...

18:42.120 --> 18:45.415
a watched preemie never grows.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.249
I let her down.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.199
She's getting the nutrition she needs.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.671
That's all that matters.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.424
I finally got colostrum,
and I dropped it.

18:54.620 --> 18:59.549
She's not nursing, so we're not bonding.

18:59.550 --> 19:01.259
She probably won't even call me "Mom."

19:01.260 --> 19:05.060
She'll just be like, "Hey,
Becky, hand me that rattle."

19:08.300 --> 19:10.060
She's never gonna love me.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.025
What?

19:12.026 --> 19:15.610
You think your baby
isn't gonna love you?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.039
Hey.

19:18.040 --> 19:22.979
Do you know all the awful
things we did to you as a baby?

19:22.980 --> 19:25.359
Well, I remember you having Darlene.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.980
That was pretty bad.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.909
Once we left you on a bus,

19:29.910 --> 19:32.979
and you went all the way to Navy Pier.

19:32.980 --> 19:35.549
We used a stroller we found in an alley,

19:35.550 --> 19:38.319
and it folded up on you.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.764
And we laughed because we were high.

19:43.680 --> 19:47.470
The point is, you still
love us, don't you?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.489
Well, I'm gonna need a
little help with the baby,

19:54.490 --> 19:57.049
so I'll say yes.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.448
Thanks, Dad.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.529
Mm, so stop worrying.

20:01.530 --> 20:04.786
You're gonna fall short. Everybody does.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.499
And so what you had a preemie?

20:07.500 --> 20:11.377
Did you really want a super
healthy, strong kid?

20:12.920 --> 20:17.679
Puny, little kids are so
much easier to keep up with.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.428
And you're gonna need that
advantage 'cause you're old.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.030
I am old.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.979
We can play "Sleeping
Beauty." You be Aurora.

20:32.980 --> 20:34.649
I'll be Maleficent. I'll start.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.159
You jump in when you feel it.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.339
No, you will not be woken

20:40.340 --> 20:43.360
until you've been kissed
by a handsome prince.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.419
Hey, Jackie.

20:48.420 --> 20:50.199
- Uh, oh, hi, Ben.
- Hey.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.239
- You startled me.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.799
I just came to see the baby.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.544
I didn't mean to interrupt
your performance.

20:56.545 --> 20:59.382
- Oh, no, I was just amusing the baby.
- Oh.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.967
You mind if I sit with you?

21:00.968 --> 21:04.219
Well, no law against sitting.

21:07.660 --> 21:09.439
You know, if somebody
walked in right now,

21:09.440 --> 21:12.559
they'd think we were just two
parents looking at our baby.

21:14.310 --> 21:16.470
She does have your eyes.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.810
No, it's not right. I can't do it.
