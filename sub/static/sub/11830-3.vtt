in almost every civil action.

24:15.422 --> 24:18.793
It's a shot at getting the case
kicked on legal grounds.

24:18.859 --> 24:21.495
They almost never work.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.164
But you're talkin'
like you're worried.

24:24.231 --> 24:27.935
Well, if we should lose,
the case is over, finished,

24:28.002 --> 24:31.772
and since this judge
seems to be a little biased, I--

24:31.839 --> 24:34.342
I won't lie.
We're a little worried.

24:34.409 --> 24:37.345
<i>So if we lose, we're done.</i>

24:37.412 --> 24:39.914
What do we get out of it
if we win?

24:39.980 --> 24:45.486
- Well, hopefully, they'll start
taking us seriously.
- <i>Right now they're not?</i>

24:45.553 --> 24:47.955
Not as much
as we'll like them to.

24:50.625 --> 24:53.261
Go. Get some rest.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.633
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:02.771 --> 25:04.673
Bobby, this judge--

25:04.740 --> 25:08.309
It may not be Pearson
he's kissing up to,
but somebody in his firm.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.979
What?
Sydney Charpools--

25:11.046 --> 25:13.649
She was a year
ahead of me at school.
She works at Finley.

25:13.715 --> 25:15.717
Before that,
she clerked for Small,

25:15.784 --> 25:19.688
and supposedly,
something happened
between them.

25:19.755 --> 25:22.791
You're just
telling me this now?
I just heard myself.

25:22.858 --> 25:25.827
Chris Kelton, a D.A.--
also in my class--
he told me.

25:25.894 --> 25:27.929
Well, can we prove it?
I don't know.

25:27.996 --> 25:30.066
Even if we could,
there's nothing to suggest
it's a factor.

25:30.132 --> 25:31.933
<i>It was more</i>
<i>than two years ago.</i>

25:32.001 --> 25:33.735
I don't think Pearson
even knows about it.

25:33.802 --> 25:36.205
Still, if we can get
that judge off this case--

25:36.272 --> 25:38.307
What are you thinking?

25:38.374 --> 25:41.677
I'm thinking that if that judge
slept with a woman
at Pearson's firm,

25:41.744 --> 25:43.846
that is a card,

25:43.913 --> 25:45.948
and it is not beneath me
to play it.

25:49.719 --> 25:53.523
- I thought he was cute.
- Mr. Holsten?

25:53.590 --> 25:57.960
- Sure.
- When you invited him to your
apartment, it was because--

25:58.027 --> 26:00.062
On this particular occasion,

26:00.129 --> 26:03.700
it was because I found him
both attractive and nice.

26:05.101 --> 26:07.737
[ Prosecutor ]
And when you quoted him 300?

26:07.804 --> 26:10.740
It was before I decided
I really liked him for free.

26:10.807 --> 26:14.377
And the dwarf?
Just a friend.

26:14.444 --> 26:17.480
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>since you yourself</i>
<i>were charged,</i>

26:17.547 --> 26:20.918
you would have an interest
in denying that this was
sex for a fee, wouldn't you?

26:20.984 --> 26:24.287
<i>Hey, I took an oath</i>
<i>to tell the truth here.</i>

26:24.354 --> 26:26.924
When this man
exposed himself to you
on the street,

26:26.990 --> 26:30.127
what exactly did that say
about him to you?

26:30.193 --> 26:33.964
Just that if I invited him
to my room, he'd probably come.

26:36.266 --> 26:40.471
The idea of setting
Ronald Martin free...

26:40.538 --> 26:44.542
has to seem horrific.

26:44.608 --> 26:48.078
He took the life
of an innocent woman.

26:48.145 --> 26:51.749
How can we excuse him?
How can we feel sorry for him?

26:51.815 --> 26:54.252
Well, you can.

26:54.318 --> 26:58.722
You can and you must,
because the law tells you to.

27:01.092 --> 27:03.794
Now, we've heard
from seven trained
medical professionals.

27:03.862 --> 27:06.764
We've heard them testify
that Ronald Martin...

27:06.831 --> 27:12.003
was ill when
he committed this act,
that he was temporarily insane.

27:12.070 --> 27:14.973
And if he didn't understand...

27:15.039 --> 27:17.341
the nature and the quality
of his act,

27:17.408 --> 27:20.344
then, legally, he's not guilty.

27:20.411 --> 27:22.514
That's the law.

27:22.581 --> 27:24.916
Now, you may not like it.
That's okay.

27:24.983 --> 27:28.920
<i>But you have an obligation</i>
<i>to uphold the law here.</i>

27:30.455 --> 27:34.359
And as you do,
as you go back
to that room to deliberate,

27:34.426 --> 27:39.164
remember that our system
of jurisprudence,
more than anything else,

27:39.231 --> 27:42.301
is designed
to protect the weak.

27:42.367 --> 27:45.905
<i>And you can hate him.</i>
<i>You can hate him.</i>

27:45.971 --> 27:48.808
That's a human thing to do.

27:48.874 --> 27:51.310
But sometimes
the function of a jury...

27:51.376 --> 27:55.781
is to defend
against human nature--
against lynch mob mentality.

27:55.848 --> 27:58.483
Because the law--

27:58.550 --> 28:02.354
The law is here to defend
the most vulnerable members
of our society,

28:02.421 --> 28:05.791
who have nowhere else
to be safeguarded
but right here.

28:05.858 --> 28:08.093
Yeah, let's all cry
for Ronald Martin.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.063
We need to feel sorry
for these poor,
misunderstood murderers.

28:11.130 --> 28:13.699
Dr. Braun, this--
He gets to sit in that room
as the victim.

28:13.766 --> 28:16.269
They're looking at him
as the casualty.
I will get my turn.

28:16.336 --> 28:18.538
My daughter's
a piece of evidence now.

28:18.604 --> 28:20.973
"The body."

28:21.040 --> 28:23.109
This is sick.
Jerry.

28:23.176 --> 28:25.278
She's not even
a person anymore.

28:25.345 --> 28:27.347
She's exhibit "A."

28:28.481 --> 28:30.350
You don't even care.

28:33.553 --> 28:35.956
I'm deeply sympathetic
to what you're going through.

28:37.157 --> 28:39.960
<i>I know this is</i>
<i>an emotional time,</i>

28:40.026 --> 28:43.129
but don't you dare
accuse me of not caring.

28:44.565 --> 28:46.467
<i>I give my closing tomorrow.</i>

28:46.533 --> 28:49.135
I promise you, I'm ready.

28:55.276 --> 28:57.844
[ Chattering ]

29:00.314 --> 29:03.184
So what are you gonna do?
I'll find something.

29:03.250 --> 29:05.519
You know me.
I always land on my feet.

29:05.586 --> 29:07.421
Jimmy, what are you
gonna do?

29:09.256 --> 29:11.692
I don't know.
You'll come work with us.

29:11.758 --> 29:14.661
What?
Our tobacco case
is heating up,

29:14.728 --> 29:16.597
and we need
all the hands we can get.

29:16.663 --> 29:19.600
You can't afford to pay you.
How do you pay me?
I'll work it out.

29:19.666 --> 29:23.437
You need therapy. You know that.
Look, just say
yes or no.

29:23.504 --> 29:26.173
You keep
digging yourself deeper.
You say you'll work it out.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.409
This is gonna be
on your tombstone--

29:28.475 --> 29:30.845
"He tried to work it out."
Now we're lookin'
at <i>your</i> tombstone.

29:30.912 --> 29:34.616
If you hang a shingle with me,
you'll at least have
an office to come to.

29:34.682 --> 29:38.486
You could pick up
some court appointments,
hustle up some contingencies--

29:38.553 --> 29:41.289
And what about the others?
How they gonna feel?

29:41.356 --> 29:44.326
Not collecting
regular paychecks,
then in comes me.

29:44.392 --> 29:47.095
How they gonna feel
about that?

29:47.162 --> 29:49.031
Look.

29:49.097 --> 29:52.900
You're where you are
'cause--

29:52.968 --> 29:55.303
'cause you helped me.

29:57.873 --> 30:00.208
It's time for me
to help you.

30:03.278 --> 30:05.280
[ Eugene ]
I could stand here
and talk about...

30:05.347 --> 30:08.150
how there's no evidence
of money changing hands.

30:08.216 --> 30:12.454
No evidence of culpable intent,
with respect to my client.

30:14.289 --> 30:16.759
Was he foolish to think
that a prostitute
was smitten with him?

30:16.825 --> 30:18.594
Of course he was.
This isn't a stable man.

30:18.661 --> 30:22.230
I don't need
to convince you of that.
He's a flasher.

30:22.298 --> 30:25.401
They didn't make
the elements here.

30:25.468 --> 30:28.204
I could sit down right now
and you'd have to come back
not guilty,

30:28.271 --> 30:30.306
but I'm gonna stay up here
just a little longer,

30:30.373 --> 30:32.308
'cause I wanna talk to you
about something else--

30:32.375 --> 30:36.479
something called
the United States of America.

30:38.681 --> 30:41.885
Big Brother police
saw Mr. Holsten
walk away with Sheila.

30:44.020 --> 30:47.957
Mr. Holsten. Gee.

30:48.024 --> 30:51.360
Look at him. Overweight.

30:51.427 --> 30:53.462
He would just have to pay
for sex, wouldn't he?

30:53.530 --> 30:55.599
<i>What woman would want</i>
<i>to be with him?</i>

30:55.665 --> 30:58.835
It must be prostitution.
"Let's follow them.
Then we'll bust the door down.

30:58.902 --> 31:01.371
<i>"We can do that</i>
<i>and get away with it.</i>
<i>You know why?</i>

31:01.438 --> 31:03.773
'Cause we don't like
the way they look."

31:03.840 --> 31:06.943
And when they charged
into that room and saw
my client handcuffed to a dwarf,

31:07.010 --> 31:10.280
well, it just had to be
something kinky.

31:11.448 --> 31:13.283
But you know what?

31:13.350 --> 31:15.552
I believe you need evidence.

31:15.619 --> 31:17.921
Times are changing.

31:17.988 --> 31:20.757
We are, in fact,
becoming a more tolerant nation.

31:20.824 --> 31:23.093
We are, in fact,
becoming a land...

31:23.160 --> 31:25.930
where people do not
prejudge on looks alone.

31:25.996 --> 31:27.965
You're three
and a half feet tall?

31:28.032 --> 31:30.200
You're still worth
the presumption of dignity.

31:30.267 --> 31:32.302
You have a sickness--
a record of exposing yourself.

31:32.369 --> 31:34.805
We will not
automatically conclude...

31:34.872 --> 31:36.741
that everything you do
is illegal.

31:36.807 --> 31:41.912
This-- <i>This</i> is
the United States of America,

31:41.979 --> 31:45.082
and this is the land
where people go back
into that jury box...

31:45.149 --> 31:48.653
and say, "Prove it.
Prove the crime.

31:48.719 --> 31:50.988
"Don't you dare put a person's
deviances on display...

31:51.055 --> 31:55.793
"and expect us to rush
to the automatic conclusion
that the crime was committed.

31:55.860 --> 31:57.895
You prove it."

31:57.962 --> 32:00.098
They didn't.

32:00.165 --> 32:02.600
Oh, they put on
a great sideshow,
but no proof.

32:02.667 --> 32:05.536
This isn't
an arena of innuendo,
ladies and gentlemen.

32:05.603 --> 32:08.439
This isn't a forum
of foregone conclusions.

32:08.506 --> 32:13.779
This is a courtroom
in the United States of America,

32:13.845 --> 32:16.047
and in this room...

32:16.114 --> 32:19.250
even when the defendants
are the disenfranchised...

32:19.317 --> 32:23.722
you've still got to prove
the elements of the crime.

32:29.595 --> 32:31.730
They didn't.

32:35.066 --> 32:36.735
Uh, Mr. Frazier?

32:40.172 --> 32:42.908
A known prostitute...

32:42.975 --> 32:46.913
quotes a convicted flasher
a price of $300.

32:46.979 --> 32:49.415
They are found
minutes later, naked...

32:49.481 --> 32:52.084
in her bed.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.990
Without passing comment
on the dwarf,

32:58.057 --> 33:00.326
I would just like to say,

33:00.392 --> 33:04.130
"Ask not what your country
can do for you.

33:04.196 --> 33:06.833
"Ask what you can do...

33:06.899 --> 33:08.835
<i>for your country."</i>

33:08.901 --> 33:11.338
And then, maybe,

33:11.404 --> 33:15.742
we can all build a bridge
to the 21st century.

33:20.813 --> 33:22.615
Are you threatening me?

33:22.682 --> 33:25.318
I'm simply saying,
given this liaison
between you...

33:25.385 --> 33:27.487
and an associate
at Finley Hogue--

33:27.554 --> 33:30.123
Who the hell
do you think you are?
This is blatant extortion.

33:30.190 --> 33:34.761
If I wanted it to be blatant,
I'd do it in open court.
Would you prefer that?

33:34.828 --> 33:36.797
Got a wife, Judge? Kids?

33:36.864 --> 33:39.733
<i>Why don't you fine me</i>
<i>50 bucks for saying that?</i>

- Is this the way
you practice law?
- If I have to.

33:42.636 --> 33:44.805
I think you better rethink
how you operate, counsel.

33:44.872 --> 33:47.340
Look, I don't know
whether this relationship
makes you biased or not.

33:47.407 --> 33:49.910
I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt
and say it doesn't,

33:49.977 --> 33:53.581
but there is definitely
some favorable treatment
going Pearson's way--

33:53.647 --> 33:55.983
<i>Intentional or not,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't care.</i>

33:56.049 --> 33:58.486

33:58.552 --> 34:01.689
Nobody but nobody
comes in this room
and strong-arms me.

34:01.755 --> 34:05.226
Fine. Let's just say
you came to this decision
on your own.

34:05.293 --> 34:09.097

by the tobacco industry.

34:09.163 --> 34:12.333
I won't let him
get screwed by you.

34:12.400 --> 34:16.871
So get off this case.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.725
What's the matter?

34:37.792 --> 34:39.661

34:48.203 --> 34:50.905
You'll work it out.

34:50.972 --> 34:54.443
I'm not sure we'll get
by summary judgment
on the tobacco case,

34:54.509 --> 34:57.012
and if Donna Braun's killer
gets off on insanity,

34:57.079 --> 34:59.181
our wrongful death claim
gets wobbled.

34:59.248 --> 35:01.150
Different standard of proof.

Even so, I borrowed
on the tobacco case

he's prepared to retry.

If that happens
after Sheila's trial,

36:28.840 --> 36:30.942

he'll have a better hand.

her sentence a little to get
her to testify against you.

to any sex clinic.

36:48.393 --> 36:52.897
If that's part of the deal--
Mr. Holsten,
listen to me for a second.

36:57.034 --> 36:59.771
Look at me.

37:02.174 --> 37:04.609
So far you ain't
made it in life.

37:04.676 --> 37:07.012
Me--
Seven years a lawyer,

37:07.079 --> 37:09.915
and I'm still representing
guys who walk around
dropping their pants.

37:09.982 --> 37:13.551
That tells me
I got some movin' up
to do too.

37:13.618 --> 37:16.388
I like to look for victories
where I can find 'em.

37:16.454 --> 37:18.456
This case here,
my little victory...

37:18.523 --> 37:20.759
will be getting a sick guy
to go for some help.

37:20.826 --> 37:24.630
If I can feel part
of getting a man
to face a problem--

37:24.697 --> 37:27.800
an illness--
that would be something.

37:27.866 --> 37:29.935
So I'm asking you.

37:30.002 --> 37:32.938
If you don't want to do
anything for yourself,
then do it for me.

37:36.742 --> 37:38.677
How long?

37:39.912 --> 37:42.014
Two months.

37:42.081 --> 37:44.583
Inpatient.

37:46.752 --> 37:48.922
Please.

37:51.825 --> 37:53.793
Okay.

37:57.163 --> 37:59.065
For the last six weeks,

37:59.132 --> 38:02.035
you have heard doctor
after doctor talk
about Ronald Martin--

38:02.101 --> 38:05.572
How he was temporarily insane,
how he wasn't responsible.

38:05.639 --> 38:09.509
He's this. He's that.
He's here.

38:11.545 --> 38:13.980
Nobody talks about Donna Braun.

38:14.047 --> 38:16.483
<i>She's no longer</i>
<i>part of our reality,</i>
<i>is she?</i>

38:16.550 --> 38:19.386
She doesn't get to sit here,
day after day,

38:19.453 --> 38:21.855
looking... human.

38:21.921 --> 38:23.990
She's past tense,

38:24.057 --> 38:27.027
and every day she becomes
a little more gone,
a little more forgotten,

38:27.094 --> 38:31.765
<i>until one day,</i>
<i>she doesn't exist at all.</i>

38:31.831 --> 38:35.402
And all you take back
into that jury room with you...

38:35.469 --> 38:38.739
is him-- Ronald Martin.

38:40.674 --> 38:44.211
That man right there
with the sad face.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.847
Man with a priest
sitting behind him.

38:46.914 --> 38:51.251
The man who all
the psychiatric experts
said such nice things about.

38:51.318 --> 38:55.790
But also the man
who strangled Donna Braun
for seven minutes.

38:55.856 --> 38:59.294
This was not
a snap flash of anger.

38:59.360 --> 39:03.831
<i>He choked her</i>
<i>for seven minutes.</i>

39:03.898 --> 39:05.833
<i>He kept squeezing</i>
<i>and squeezing...</i>

39:05.900 --> 39:07.835
<i>until her eyes</i>
<i>bulged out of her sockets,</i>

39:07.902 --> 39:11.939
<i>until there was</i>
<i>no life left in her.</i>

39:12.007 --> 39:15.776
That's how he left her
as he drove off to the church
to beg forgiveness.

39:18.546 --> 39:23.919
Now, Mr. Goode implores you
to protect the American
justice system.

39:23.985 --> 39:26.554
What is that system?

39:26.622 --> 39:29.024
Where rich people
buy acquittals?

39:29.090 --> 39:32.460
Where, if you have
enough money, you're
entitled to one free murder?

39:32.528 --> 39:35.096
Well, we need to know
that's not our system.

39:35.163 --> 39:37.433
They need to know.

39:38.467 --> 39:41.102
<i>They lost their daughter--</i>

39:41.169 --> 39:43.104
<i>their only daughter.</i>

39:43.171 --> 39:47.643
<i>They need to hear you say</i>
<i>that is not our system</i>
<i>of justice.</i>

39:47.709 --> 39:50.512
We all need to hear that.

39:55.151 --> 39:58.888
Mr. Pearson,
I'll hear from you.
Thank you, Your Honor.

39:58.955 --> 40:04.660
I'm Anderson Pearson,
representing the respondent,
T.L. Michaels,

40:04.726 --> 40:09.365
and pursuant to rule 56
of the Massachusetts
Rules of Civil Procedure,

40:09.431 --> 40:13.435
we submit
the plaintiff's claim--
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

40:13.502 --> 40:16.806
Forgive me.
I'm a little confused.

40:16.873 --> 40:19.642
According to your clerk's
notice, we were to hear--
What is it?

40:19.709 --> 40:22.645
<i>"Any and all discovery</i>
<i>or pretrial matters...</i>

40:22.712 --> 40:24.781
before oral arguments
on summary judgment."

40:24.847 --> 40:28.117
- There are no other matters.
- <i>Well, actually,</i>

40:28.185 --> 40:32.255
there is one other
nagging little matter.

40:43.500 --> 40:49.039
I've decided to dispense
with oral arguments,
Mr. Pearson.

40:49.106 --> 40:52.976
I find there to be
several obvious disputes
of material fact in this case.

40:53.043 --> 40:56.947
<i>Defendant's motion</i>
<i>for summary judgment</i>
<i>is hereby denied.</i>

40:57.014 --> 40:58.949
Ruling in favor
of the plaintiff.

40:59.016 --> 41:02.152
Moreover, I recuse myself
from this case.

41:02.219 --> 41:06.023
Another judge
will be assigned.
Adjourned.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.393
[ Murmuring ]

41:09.460 --> 41:11.562
[ Ray ]
So what happens now?

41:11.629 --> 41:13.464
What happens now is,
we get our day in court--

41:13.531 --> 41:15.566
with a jury.

41:15.633 --> 41:18.136
We are in the fight.
We are in the fight.

41:23.807 --> 41:26.077
Oh.

41:26.144 --> 41:28.780
Quite pleased, are we?

41:28.847 --> 41:32.150
- What was all that, Lindsay?
- The beginning, Professor.

41:32.216 --> 41:37.155
- Do you know
what you're in for?
- I think so. Do you?

41:41.259 --> 41:43.995
[ No Audible Dialogue ]

41:52.003 --> 41:54.906
Hey, Jimmy.
Eugene Young.

41:54.973 --> 41:57.742
Don't know that we've
officially met.

41:59.311 --> 42:02.047
Welcome.
Thanks.

42:02.114 --> 42:05.050
Heard a lot about you.
<i>[ Ellenor ]</i>
<i>We're very excited.</i>

42:05.117 --> 42:08.954
You need anything supply-wise,
just let me know. I already
got your phone line set up.

42:09.021 --> 42:11.190
Oh, great.
Well, I don't need much.

42:11.256 --> 42:13.926
A pad of paper
and somebody to sue,
you know?

42:17.529 --> 42:20.132
Listen, uh, thanks for this.

42:20.199 --> 42:23.135
I know it couldn't
have been good news,
bringing in another body--

42:23.202 --> 42:26.939
especially mine--
but, uh, this is gonna be
a big year for me.

42:27.006 --> 42:30.610
I promise.
I'm gonna win a case.

42:32.177 --> 42:34.414
We have no doubt.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.382
Thanks.

42:38.117 --> 42:41.086
The judge will instruct
on Monday, then it's up
to the jury.

42:41.154 --> 42:43.689
Any progress finding
the old girlfriend?

42:43.756 --> 42:47.127
No.
We're running
out of time.

42:47.193 --> 42:50.530
<i>Miss Bork?</i>
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your words.</i>

42:50.596 --> 42:53.266
I hope the jury listened.
So do we.

42:54.734 --> 42:57.103
It's almost over.
Yes.

42:59.105 --> 43:01.307
Part of me
is glad for that.

43:01.374 --> 43:03.844
Another part--

43:03.910 --> 43:06.647
I wonder what
we're going to do
when it is over.

43:13.820 --> 43:15.856
I'll see you.
Yeah.

43:21.495 --> 43:23.497
Lindsay.

43:23.564 --> 43:26.200
Uh, the tobacco case--

43:26.267 --> 43:28.835
I want you to try it.

43:30.004 --> 43:32.506
<i>I think you're more</i>
<i>prepared on it than me.</i>

43:32.573 --> 43:36.077
Bobby, I--
I've never even done
a jury trial before.

43:36.143 --> 43:38.079
Are you sure?

43:38.145 --> 43:40.948
You've done all the discovery.
I think you're ready.

43:42.917 --> 43:46.553
- You think you can do it?
- Uh--

43:46.621 --> 43:48.623
Sure.
<i>Tell me if you can't.</i>

43:48.690 --> 43:51.158
You don't have
to be a hero here.

43:52.393 --> 43:54.295
I can do it.

44:00.034 --> 44:01.869
Okay.

44:02.804 --> 44:04.906
Let's go.

44:20.989 --> 44:22.958
Next onThe Practice.

44:23.025 --> 44:26.695
Ex-girlfriend of Ronald Martin,
and he beat the hell
out of her for two years.

44:26.762 --> 44:28.130
Eugene, the jury
is already deliberating.

44:28.196 --> 44:31.333
If you drag the jury
back in here...

44:31.399 --> 44:33.936
and tell them,
"By the way, we have
discovered a new witness.

44:34.002 --> 44:37.406
It's a woman that Ronald Martin
tried to strangle,"
we might as well...

44:37.473 --> 44:39.241
save time and declare
a mistrial right now.

44:39.307 --> 44:41.176
The jury is free
to disregard the witness.

44:41.243 --> 44:44.146
That's your specialty--
convincing people
to ignore the truth.

44:44.212 --> 44:46.649
Look, we can't match experts
with the tobacco industry.

44:46.715 --> 44:49.485
If we parade up scientists
on addiction or dopamine
or whatever, we lose,

44:49.552 --> 44:51.587
'cause whatever guns we got,
they got bigger ones.

44:51.654 --> 44:54.357
We don't have the experts
because we couldn't
afford to hire any.

44:54.423 --> 44:58.794
We don't have the-the
science on addiction because
we didn't do the legwork.

44:58.861 --> 45:02.031
We're going with nothing
because that's what we have.
Nothing.

45:02.098 --> 45:04.067
You're throwing me
this case not because
of any confidence,

45:04.133 --> 45:06.235
but because you don't want
to take the fall.

45:06.297 --> 45:09.397
- Mr. Donnell?
- Ready for trial, Your Honor.

45:09.464 --> 45:12.430
<i>Mr. Pearson?</i>
Ready for trial, Your Honor.
