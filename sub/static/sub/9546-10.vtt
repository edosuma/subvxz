00:23.532 --> 00:25.310
Your liquor license
is expired.

00:26.531 --> 00:27.975
It's probably all right.

00:29.009 --> 00:31.628
My name is Adrian Monk.
I'm meeting someone.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.461
Mr. Monk?

00:49.271 --> 00:50.467
Thank you for coming.

00:50.738 --> 00:51.865
Sit down.

00:55.343 --> 00:56.506
I know your work.

00:56.887 --> 00:58.367
I'm a big fan.

01:09.789 --> 01:12.607
There's, uh,
more light over there.

01:13.335 --> 01:14.467
I prefer the dark.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.150
You obviously got my note.

01:18.068 --> 01:19.334
And the money.

01:19.564 --> 01:22.814
$500 to meet you alone,
ten minutes.

01:22.884 --> 01:24.167
It's very generous.

01:24.323 --> 01:26.319
There's more
where that came from.

01:26.772 --> 01:28.921
I have a job to offer you,
Mr. Monk.

01:29.596 --> 01:30.800
It will take you
one night.

01:31.057 --> 01:32.278
Not even one night.

01:32.701 --> 01:33.891
Two hours.

01:34.833 --> 01:38.082
I'm willing to pay you $20,000
for your trouble.

01:41.628 --> 01:43.894
My name is Derek Bronson.

01:45.244 --> 01:46.269
Bronson?

01:46.351 --> 01:47.876
Bronson Technologies.

01:48.725 --> 01:49.860
I thought he--

01:50.701 --> 01:52.595
- You--
- You thought I was dead.

01:53.406 --> 01:55.521
Most days, I wish I was.

01:56.131 --> 01:59.234
I was ballooning solo
up the coast.

01:59.267 --> 02:01.078
I'd done it
a thousand times.

02:01.423 --> 02:03.761
That day,
seven years ago,

02:04.176 --> 02:05.644
the trade wind shifted.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.604
Everybody assumed
I was lost at sea.

02:09.121 --> 02:11.967
Actually, I landed
on a small island

02:12.000 --> 02:13.267
west of Guam.

02:13.689 --> 02:15.933
And you stayed there
for seven years?

02:16.357 --> 02:18.224
I could've come
back years ago.

02:18.491 --> 02:19.489
But...

02:19.876 --> 02:21.067
I got sick.

02:22.136 --> 02:24.380
Would you like to hear
about the job?

02:24.905 --> 02:26.067
Yes, of course.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.592
But first,
I have a couple of questions.

02:28.933 --> 02:30.367
Sick is a funny word.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.933
Could mean anything
from a mild headache to--

02:33.967 --> 02:35.267
When I say sick,

02:35.409 --> 02:37.171
I mean <i>sick.</i>

02:39.300 --> 02:40.333
Mr. Monk...

02:43.534 --> 02:44.779
I am a leper.

02:50.011 --> 02:52.034
There you are.
I was getting worried about you.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.800
Just get in. Get in.
Start the car!

02:53.836 --> 02:55.301
Well, what happened?
Tell you later.

02:55.334 --> 02:56.611
Let's get out of here.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.791
What are you doing?
Unlock the door!

02:59.816 --> 03:01.651
- It's a new car.
- Natalie. Please!

03:01.729 --> 03:03.301
It must be this button.
I don't know.

03:03.334 --> 03:04.601
Forget it!
Oh, wait.

03:04.634 --> 03:05.881
Mr. Monk,
where are you going?

03:05.922 --> 03:07.267
I'll meet you
back at the house.

03:07.301 --> 03:08.445
Wait, Mr. Monk.

03:08.533 --> 03:09.768
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.028
Mr. Monk, I got it.

03:11.701 --> 03:12.818
I got it!

04:14.944 --> 04:16.071
Any more soap?

04:16.497 --> 04:17.534
That's it.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.707
No, I mean is there any more
soap in San Francisco?

04:19.750 --> 04:22.715
Mr. Monk, you've been
scrubbing your hand for nine hours.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.394
I'm surprised you have
any skin left.

04:24.453 --> 04:25.667
It's not coming out.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.434
I can still feel it.
I think it's spreading.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.670
What are you doing?

04:32.764 --> 04:33.891
Is that kerosene?

04:37.053 --> 04:38.534
- Light me.
- What?

04:38.568 --> 04:40.353
For the love of God,
light me!

04:40.436 --> 04:42.720
Okay, Mr. Monk,
I'm not gonna light your hand on fire.

04:42.778 --> 04:43.799
Fine.

04:45.847 --> 04:46.979
You know what?
Get out--

04:47.026 --> 04:48.468
You are overreacting,
all right?

04:48.693 --> 04:50.515
All you did was shake
a man's hand.

04:53.349 --> 04:54.464
You're right.

04:56.370 --> 04:57.600
You know what?

04:58.529 --> 05:00.454
I'm glad it happened.

05:02.694 --> 05:03.934
The worst possible thing

05:03.967 --> 05:05.834
that could ever happen to me
has happened.

05:06.087 --> 05:07.226
I shook hands...

05:07.861 --> 05:09.023
with a leper.

05:10.116 --> 05:11.239
And I survived.

05:11.286 --> 05:12.478
Exactly.

05:13.234 --> 05:14.923
Worst moment of my life

05:15.663 --> 05:16.990
is behind me now.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.114
I'm free.

05:22.965 --> 05:24.067
Wait.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.779
Okay, now I'm free.

05:30.295 --> 05:31.468
Um, actually...

05:31.658 --> 05:33.655
Mr. Monk, it's not
completely over.

05:33.738 --> 05:35.106
Uh, don't be mad.

05:35.528 --> 05:37.783
But I talked
to Mr. Bronson.

05:37.807 --> 05:39.157
You did what?
What?!

05:39.301 --> 05:40.781
He called here this morning.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.244
The leper?!
He called me?

05:42.303 --> 05:43.374
On what phone?
On this--

05:43.435 --> 05:44.879
- On this phone?
- Yes.

05:45.501 --> 05:47.579
Mr. Monk, you can't catch
anything over the phone.

05:48.166 --> 05:50.421
And now, all of the sudden,
you're an expert on lepers?

05:50.464 --> 05:52.046
You know,
he's a nice man, all right?

05:52.070 --> 05:54.265
He's in pain.
He was crying his eyes out.

05:54.345 --> 05:55.839
And-- okay,
listen to me.

05:56.086 --> 05:57.348
He upped his offer.

05:57.477 --> 05:59.654
He said he would pay you
$25,000.

05:59.738 --> 06:01.288
All you have to do
is meet him again.

06:01.323 --> 06:02.586
Natalie, listen.

06:03.813 --> 06:05.938
Let me explain
something to you.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.301
No!

06:10.947 --> 06:12.594
That's it?
That's your argument?

06:12.665 --> 06:14.101
Okay, let's go through it.

06:14.184 --> 06:17.527
A, whatever he's asking us
to do is probably illegal.

06:17.820 --> 06:19.548
B through Z,

06:19.835 --> 06:21.401
- the man is a leper!
- You know what?

06:21.434 --> 06:23.695
I don't know anything
about leprosy, and neither do you.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.028
So I called a doctor.

06:25.063 --> 06:26.202
He's a specialist.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.234
He said we could come in
and talk with him.

06:28.486 --> 06:30.301
Let's just see
what he recommends, okay?

06:30.348 --> 06:32.349
I mean, it can't hurt to listen, right?

06:33.124 --> 06:35.110
$25,000.

06:46.283 --> 06:47.457
You okay?

06:48.842 --> 06:50.361
Are you holding your breath?

07:02.783 --> 07:04.040
Is that Randy?

07:05.872 --> 07:07.081
Oh, my God.

07:07.609 --> 07:08.995
That is so funny.

07:09.798 --> 07:11.175
Not funny
in a "Ha, ha" way,

07:11.222 --> 07:14.019
but funny in an "Oh, boy, this'll really
embarrass him" way.

07:14.188 --> 07:15.182
Miss Teeger?

07:15.545 --> 07:17.098
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm--

07:17.738 --> 07:19.033
I'm Dr. Polanski.

07:19.234 --> 07:20.338
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:20.385 --> 07:21.756
So-- so nice to meet you.

07:21.979 --> 07:24.140
This is my boss.
This is Adrian Monk.

07:24.553 --> 07:27.460
Thank you for seeing us.
It won't take much of your time.

07:27.554 --> 07:29.104
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:31.262 --> 07:33.359
- Oh, Doctor. Can I ask you one thing?
- Certainly.

07:33.417 --> 07:34.661
Right over here.

07:35.899 --> 07:37.543
- Go ahead.
- Is that Randy Disher?

07:37.579 --> 07:39.754
Yeah, Randy was one
of my first patients.

07:40.006 --> 07:41.000
Do you know him?

07:41.034 --> 07:42.267
Uh, I know Randy Disher.

07:42.301 --> 07:43.468
I don't know that kid.

07:43.718 --> 07:45.278
Well, you know,
teen years.

07:45.454 --> 07:47.158
I don't know how
any of us survived it.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.492
We can talk over here.
Come on.

07:54.877 --> 07:56.533
You're not gonna catch
anything in here.

07:56.627 --> 07:57.717
Promise.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.329
Come on.

08:00.774 --> 08:01.866
Now.

08:01.925 --> 08:03.005
What can I do for you?

08:03.040 --> 08:06.530
Could you explain to my friend
that leprosy is a serious condition?

08:06.612 --> 08:08.025
It's very contagious.

08:08.072 --> 08:10.767
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.372
- See?
- For one thing,

08:12.454 --> 08:14.177
it's not called leprosy anymore.

08:14.248 --> 08:15.700
It's called Hansen's disease.

08:15.733 --> 08:18.501
It's quite rare.
Most people are naturally immune to it.

08:18.587 --> 08:20.237
And if you do happen
to contract it,

08:20.261 --> 08:22.556
it's easily treatable
with an antibiotic

08:22.867 --> 08:23.891
called halazzen.

08:23.926 --> 08:26.290
See, I've been talking to this man.
He wants to hire us.

08:26.337 --> 08:27.802
But he's allergic to halazzen.

08:27.872 --> 08:29.035
Yes, that does happen.

08:29.286 --> 08:30.436
Is his condition full-blown?

08:30.472 --> 08:31.697
Oh, yes.

08:33.711 --> 08:35.530
Ye-- yes, yes.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.658
Yes, full-blown.

08:37.833 --> 08:38.866
Fullll...

08:39.133 --> 08:40.249
- blown!
- Sir?

08:40.288 --> 08:41.433
Full-blown.

08:41.708 --> 08:43.166
I don't think
you have to worry.

08:43.212 --> 08:45.160
As I said,
it's not very contagious.

08:45.783 --> 08:48.066
I've been practicing for 15 years.

08:48.156 --> 08:50.272
I've only seen one case
first-hand.

08:51.329 --> 08:53.938
I can't do it.
I just-- I-- I can't do it.

08:54.169 --> 08:55.192
Well, how about this?

08:55.263 --> 08:56.860
If you do contract
the disease...

08:58.118 --> 08:59.386
I'll treat you for free.

09:00.689 --> 09:03.067
The hell are you talking about?
How 'bout this?

09:03.337 --> 09:05.430
We never call the guy back.
We don't see him again.

09:05.468 --> 09:07.201
I avoid him
like the plague.

09:07.379 --> 09:08.534
Yeah, you know what?

09:08.568 --> 09:10.367
- Exactly like the plague.
- You know what?

09:10.401 --> 09:12.036
Could I just talk to you for a second?

09:12.071 --> 09:13.680
- Just excuse us.
- Please.

09:15.198 --> 09:16.290
Mr. Monk.

09:17.328 --> 09:18.948
- Did you hear what he just said?
- No.

09:18.983 --> 09:20.800
He said it's almost
impossible to catch.

09:20.834 --> 09:21.841
Yeah.

09:21.891 --> 09:23.441
In that sentence,
for me,

09:23.758 --> 09:27.434
the word "almost" is really
the most interesting word.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.501
Okay, Mr. Bronson has an affliction.

09:29.534 --> 09:31.273
He needs our compassion
and understanding.

09:31.292 --> 09:33.767
You know what? Let me let you in
on a little secret, Mr. Monk.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.937
You're no picnic, either.

09:34.963 --> 09:37.522
A lot of people would rather
not deal with you, but they do.

09:37.625 --> 09:38.967
They reach out to you.

09:39.155 --> 09:42.616
And Mr. Bronson is offering us
a lot of money to do the same thing.

09:42.692 --> 09:45.600
And I've been talking to him. You
wouldn't even have to shake his hand.

09:45.633 --> 09:46.653
Good.

09:46.767 --> 09:48.574
Good.
Because I would rather die...

09:48.837 --> 09:50.267
than have to shake
his hand again.

09:50.301 --> 09:51.756
You don't even have
to look at him.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.534
All you have to do
is go back to that bar

09:53.568 --> 09:55.346
and sit and listen
to what he has to say.

09:55.381 --> 09:57.111
You just sit there
and listen.

09:57.946 --> 09:59.534
Stop it.
Stop.

10:02.984 --> 10:04.651
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Monk.

10:05.318 --> 10:07.480
I was afraid you wouldn't want
to see me again.

10:07.915 --> 10:09.363
Why would you think that?

10:10.828 --> 10:13.301
My assistant is over there.

10:16.834 --> 10:19.238
I know she'd like
to meet you.

10:19.468 --> 10:20.501
I'm sorry.

10:20.645 --> 10:22.800
I can't bear to have
a woman see me.

10:23.016 --> 10:24.067
Not like this.

10:24.253 --> 10:25.345
I'm hideous.

10:25.568 --> 10:26.828
No.

10:27.553 --> 10:30.160
I wouldn't say...
hideous, exactly.

10:32.014 --> 10:33.189
Believe it or not,

10:33.578 --> 10:35.867
women used to find me
quite attractive.

10:36.085 --> 10:37.506
I never went home alone.

10:38.508 --> 10:40.034
After I married Mandy,

10:40.694 --> 10:42.808
I resisted those kind
of temptations.

10:43.607 --> 10:46.067
At least, I usually
resisted them.

10:46.101 --> 10:47.587
Gah! Oh, God.

10:48.107 --> 10:49.667
- Have I offended you?
- No.

10:49.771 --> 10:51.522
No, sorry.
You just leaned into the light.

10:51.569 --> 10:52.637
Sorry.

10:54.826 --> 10:56.067
I had an affair.

10:56.485 --> 10:58.105
That was my first mistake.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.754
She wrote me some letters,
which I kept.

11:01.083 --> 11:03.184
That was mistake number two.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.973
In a week, there'll be
a probate hearing.

11:07.332 --> 11:09.000
I'll be officially
declared dead.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.700
The vultures are gonna go
through my office,

11:12.116 --> 11:14.864
reading every file,
opening every drawer.

11:16.216 --> 11:17.531
They'll find the letters.

11:18.902 --> 11:21.544
The letters themselves
don't mean anything to me.

11:22.288 --> 11:24.354
But they would destroy
my wife.

11:26.345 --> 11:28.903
Mr. Monk,
I want to hire you

11:28.983 --> 11:30.322
to break into my home,

11:30.903 --> 11:33.468
find the letters,
and bring them back.

11:36.344 --> 11:38.117
That's the job?

11:39.173 --> 11:40.582
It's still my house.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.800
So you wouldn't be
breaking any law.

11:45.345 --> 11:47.234
Why don't you just
do it yourself?

11:51.556 --> 11:52.568
I tried.

11:53.907 --> 11:54.918
<i>I-- </i>

11:54.953 --> 11:56.733
<i>I just couldn't do it.</i>

11:58.067 --> 11:59.206
That house...

11:59.827 --> 12:02.352
that life,
everything I've lost.

12:04.733 --> 12:05.897
It's just...

12:07.002 --> 12:08.247
too painful.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.822
I've drawn you a map.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.428
Everything you need--
the layout,

12:17.651 --> 12:19.107
the security codes.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.024
I just have one question.

12:23.692 --> 12:24.784
Why me?

12:25.867 --> 12:27.034
I'm not a thief.

12:27.222 --> 12:28.267
Exactly.

12:29.277 --> 12:31.285
You're an honorable man.

12:32.102 --> 12:34.501
You won't turn around
and try to blackmail me.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.376
Mr. Monk,
I am at your mercy.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.123
I'm reaching out to you.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.840
That's okay.
I get it.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.767
You don't have
to really...reach.

12:43.939 --> 12:45.101
I get it.

12:45.813 --> 12:47.680
Will you help me?

13:00.066 --> 13:01.381
So what happened?

13:06.365 --> 13:07.765
I took the job.

13:22.193 --> 13:23.349
Be careful.

13:23.743 --> 13:25.046
I could use some help.

13:25.467 --> 13:27.631
I am helping.
I just told you to be careful.

13:27.689 --> 13:29.139
Wish we had more time.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.337
No, no, no.
It has to be tonight.

13:31.372 --> 13:33.534
The leper said his wife
goes into town

13:33.568 --> 13:35.267
every Friday
to visit her mother.

13:35.319 --> 13:37.198
Mr. Monk, please stop
calling him "the leper."

13:37.233 --> 13:38.244
He has a name.

13:38.267 --> 13:40.556
Believe me, he's got
other things to worry about.

13:40.733 --> 13:42.390
Car!
Car!

13:46.554 --> 13:47.834
Get down!

13:53.289 --> 13:54.867
Okay.
Now.

13:55.603 --> 13:57.034
Hurry.
What are you waiting for?

13:57.067 --> 13:58.301
Go!

14:05.291 --> 14:06.978
- Okay, you're next.
- No.

14:07.081 --> 14:09.347
It's, uh--
it's wobbly.

14:09.388 --> 14:10.797
Somebody has to hold it.

14:10.881 --> 14:12.913
Mr. Monk, I can't come back.
I'm already over.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.898
Well, it's too wobbly.

14:15.074 --> 14:16.342
Look, it's all wobbly.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.534
I can't climb this.
Why is it so wobbly?

14:18.793 --> 14:20.623
- How did you do that?
- I opened the gate.

14:20.683 --> 14:22.301
Good thinking.
Okay, hold the ladder.

14:22.334 --> 14:23.625
No, Mr. Monk,
the gate is open.

14:23.649 --> 14:25.152
Natalie, look.

14:26.258 --> 14:28.736
These are the leper's instructions.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.967
I promised him I would
follow them to a tee.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.007
We nodded on it.

14:32.036 --> 14:33.292
Well, I'm using the gate.

14:34.579 --> 14:36.223
Okay, but don't tell the leper.

14:42.168 --> 14:44.920
The leper was right.
She never changed the locks.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.087
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.437
He said it's kinda tricky.

14:51.305 --> 14:52.773
He says you have
to slide it.

14:55.778 --> 14:56.917
Here's the code.

14:56.987 --> 14:59.347
<i>2, 4, 6, 2.</i>

15:02.271 --> 15:03.809
The leper thought
of everything.

15:20.842 --> 15:22.333
They look so happy.

15:27.352 --> 15:28.526
Here it is.

15:29.521 --> 15:30.613
Top drawer.

15:33.468 --> 15:34.701
In the back.

15:37.532 --> 15:38.568
Freeze!

15:38.716 --> 15:39.867
Don't move.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.157
I'm calling the police.

15:41.436 --> 15:44.067
You're supposed
to be at your mother's.

15:45.706 --> 15:47.501
My mother died
five years ago.

15:48.602 --> 15:49.729
What are those?

15:50.577 --> 15:52.367
What are those?
Throw them here now.

15:52.659 --> 15:53.728
Now!

15:56.789 --> 15:58.902
Mrs. Bronson, you don't want
to read those.

16:02.490 --> 16:03.653
Who sent you?

16:04.534 --> 16:05.534
Here's the thing.

16:05.568 --> 16:07.967
I said who sent you?

16:09.367 --> 16:10.481
Your husband.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.568
Derek?

16:14.277 --> 16:15.401
He's alive?

16:19.847 --> 16:20.934
Is he okay?

16:21.968 --> 16:23.029
Well...

16:23.146 --> 16:26.270
"Okay" is a funny word.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.763
So you've seen him?

16:29.909 --> 16:31.026
Most of him.

16:31.109 --> 16:32.167
Where is he?

16:32.626 --> 16:34.047
Can you take me to him?

16:34.231 --> 16:35.704
Mrs. Bronson,
you need to trust us.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.799
There are reasons why
your husband cannot see you.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.967
What, because of these?

16:39.481 --> 16:40.667
These don't mean a thing.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.210
I've known about this girl
for years.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.299
Please.
I have to see him.

16:44.381 --> 16:46.024
That's not a good idea.
Trust us.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.934
Or I can have you
both arrested right now

16:47.967 --> 16:49.395
for breaking and entering.

16:59.031 --> 17:00.076
Over here.

17:01.833 --> 17:02.949
Mr. Monk?

17:03.978 --> 17:05.134
Miss--

17:07.233 --> 17:08.586
Miss Teeger.

17:09.521 --> 17:10.731
Did you get the letters?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.040
Derek.

17:12.363 --> 17:13.960
- Mandy.
- You're alive?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.034
I knew it.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.296
I always knew it.

17:18.092 --> 17:19.489
You're wrong, darling.

17:20.138 --> 17:21.678
I died seven years ago.

17:25.842 --> 17:27.300
Are you looking for these?

17:27.334 --> 17:28.461
Oh, Mandy.

17:28.957 --> 17:30.589
She didn't mean
anything to me.

17:30.977 --> 17:32.379
I know that, Derek.

17:32.837 --> 17:34.834
I've known about this woman
for years.

17:35.142 --> 17:37.201
I forgave you
a long, long time ago.

17:37.435 --> 17:38.623
No, please.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.149
Stay away.

17:41.188 --> 17:42.245
It's okay.

17:44.767 --> 17:45.859
It's okay.

17:46.766 --> 17:47.951
Let me see you.

17:55.766 --> 17:57.093
I just want you
to come home.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.795
I can't.
Not like this.

17:59.499 --> 18:01.283
Go away.
Forget about me.

18:01.495 --> 18:02.974
Darling, there are doctors,

18:03.334 --> 18:05.399
treatments.
There must be something they can do.

18:05.423 --> 18:06.855
You don't think I've tried?

18:07.034 --> 18:08.767
I've gone to every doctor
in Europe.

18:08.971 --> 18:11.580
No one would have to see you.
You could stay inside.

18:11.631 --> 18:13.564
We could build you a room
in the new house.

18:13.638 --> 18:14.675
What new house?

18:14.722 --> 18:16.377
You're-- you're moving?

18:16.501 --> 18:17.690
I have to move.

18:18.468 --> 18:20.079
As of next week,
you're legally dead.

18:20.114 --> 18:22.134
Your sister's kids
will inherit everything.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.134
I--

18:23.167 --> 18:24.434
I barely know them.

18:24.674 --> 18:27.633
Darling,
that money is yours.

18:27.701 --> 18:30.034
Unfortunately,
your will says otherwise.

18:30.230 --> 18:31.334
Tell them I'm not dead.

18:31.367 --> 18:32.934
I'm--
I'll write you a letter.

18:32.967 --> 18:34.034
Sweetheart.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.626
They're not going
to believe me.

18:35.661 --> 18:36.765
Or any letter.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.521
There's a probate hearing next week.
You could come.

18:41.544 --> 18:42.965
You could talk to them.

18:43.241 --> 18:45.002
No, no.
It's out of the question.

18:46.127 --> 18:47.407
Not like this.

18:52.386 --> 18:53.548
Mr. Monk.

18:53.619 --> 18:54.828
Is that you?

19:03.501 --> 19:04.887
Yes, yes.

19:05.279 --> 19:07.440
I'm afraid I have
one more favor to ask.

19:08.631 --> 19:12.025
"Wife Claims Missing
"Billionaire Husband Still Alive.

19:12.201 --> 19:14.244
"Probate hearing
is set for tomorrow.

19:14.855 --> 19:17.034
"Former homicide detective
Adrian Monk

19:17.067 --> 19:18.358
is set to testify."

19:19.042 --> 19:20.410
What the hell's
Hansen's disease?

19:20.445 --> 19:22.312
Leprosy.
He's a leper.

19:23.177 --> 19:24.201
Oh, my God.

19:24.234 --> 19:27.216
I thought they lived in colonies.
You know, like in <i>Ben Hur.</i>

19:27.500 --> 19:29.867
And, uh, you met this guy
face-to-face?

19:29.900 --> 19:32.478
Yep, he's a client.
He called us. He needed our help.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.709
Mr. Monk put aside
all his fear and prejudice

19:34.756 --> 19:37.656
and offered to do what he could,
and I am very, very proud of him.

19:37.750 --> 19:38.934
I shook his hand.

19:38.998 --> 19:40.043
I can still feel it.

19:40.101 --> 19:42.688
He's not at all contagious.
We talked to a specialist.

19:42.988 --> 19:45.195
Randy, I think
you might know him.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.658
Dr. Polanski?

19:47.573 --> 19:48.572
No.

19:48.630 --> 19:50.173
Aaron Polanski?

19:51.287 --> 19:53.253
- Can't say that I do.
- Really?

19:53.312 --> 19:56.289
Because we thought we saw your picture
hanging up in his office.

19:58.733 --> 20:00.267
Right.
It was a case.

20:00.568 --> 20:03.320
I was undercover,
posing as a kid,

20:03.355 --> 20:04.967
a teenager with bad acne.

20:05.108 --> 20:06.423
Captain, you remember that case?

20:06.481 --> 20:08.470
- You're on your own, Randy.
- Still tingling.

20:08.696 --> 20:11.399
Well, I'll tell him you said hi.
We're going out tomorrow night.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.573
When this hearing
was originally scheduled,

21:13.620 --> 21:15.992
the intention was
to have Mr. Bronson

21:16.039 --> 21:17.836
officially declared deceased.

21:18.112 --> 21:20.425
But, as you all know,
some new information

21:20.472 --> 21:22.401
has surfaced,
provided by his wife

21:22.434 --> 21:23.616
Mrs. Bronson.

21:24.098 --> 21:26.106
We have her statement,

21:26.433 --> 21:30.201
plus a handwritten letter
from Mr. Bronson.

21:30.234 --> 21:31.584
Which cannot be authenticated.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.381
Of course it's not
a perfect match.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.095
I told you.
Derek is sick.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.858
He could hardly write
his own name.

21:36.881 --> 21:38.325
That's rather convenient,
isn't it?

21:38.337 --> 21:39.476
It wasn't just me.

21:39.844 --> 21:41.347
Mr. Monk saw him, too.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.191
Your Honor, if I may.

21:43.532 --> 21:44.536
Mr. Monk.

21:44.853 --> 21:46.301
Is this the man you saw?

21:49.507 --> 21:50.533
I believe it is.

21:50.635 --> 21:51.798
According to your testimony,

21:51.856 --> 21:54.463
you only saw him in a dimly lit bar
and a parking garage.

21:54.655 --> 21:55.834
Hardly ideal conditions.

21:56.056 --> 21:57.067
That's true.

21:57.199 --> 21:58.800
Well, Mr. Bronson's nephews

21:58.834 --> 22:02.122
have been waiting a long time
for this estate to be probated.

22:02.921 --> 22:06.134
I'm reluctant to make a decision
based on one man's testimony.

22:06.532 --> 22:09.016
Your Honor, Adrian Monk
is not just anyone.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.853
His memory and powers
of observation are legendary.

22:11.888 --> 22:15.409
Well, there's a lot at stake here.
You say he has a great memory.

22:17.997 --> 22:19.042
Mr. Monk.

22:19.159 --> 22:21.954
Would you mind standing up
and turning around?

22:28.790 --> 22:30.786
Could you describe my shirt?

22:33.433 --> 22:34.450
Which one?

22:35.101 --> 22:36.293
Which one?

22:36.633 --> 22:39.717
The shirt you're wearing, or
the shirt your stenographer is wearing?

22:40.832 --> 22:42.453
That's your shirt, too, isn't it?

22:43.767 --> 22:44.973
You cut yourself shaving,

22:45.031 --> 22:47.467
and there's a tiny drop
of blood on her collar.

22:49.557 --> 22:50.978
What are you implying?

22:52.399 --> 22:55.487
You were having a sex affair
with her on that couch.

22:56.267 --> 22:57.911
The cushions are backwards.

22:58.201 --> 23:00.001
And one of her earrings fell off.

23:01.322 --> 23:02.367
It's, um...

23:02.791 --> 23:04.001
it's right here.

23:11.144 --> 23:12.585
She must have torn
her blouse.

23:12.632 --> 23:15.180
I can see it sticking out
of her briefcase.

23:18.055 --> 23:19.088
Your Honor.

23:22.770 --> 23:24.695
I'm ready with my decision.

23:26.074 --> 23:30.377
I will accept Mr. Monk's word
that he met with Derek Bronson.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.467
Therefore, Mrs. Bronson

23:32.500 --> 23:35.545
will retain control
of the entire estate.

23:41.739 --> 23:43.595
How long has Mr. Steiner
been living here?

23:43.759 --> 23:44.819
11 years.

23:44.854 --> 23:48.729
And he never missed a canasta game
in all that time until last night.

23:48.838 --> 23:50.334
When was the last time
you saw him?

23:50.404 --> 23:52.353
Monday.
I saw him leaving.

23:52.418 --> 23:54.250
And he didn't have a gig.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.001
I could tell because he didn't
take his sheet music.

23:57.088 --> 23:58.298
He's a musician.

23:59.145 --> 24:01.017
I know he's a musician.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.052
He's one of my oldest tenants.

24:03.087 --> 24:04.861
You don't think I know
he's a musician?

24:04.908 --> 24:06.364
Mrs. Kennedy, relax.

24:07.718 --> 24:09.855
When you called the police,
you asked for homicide.

24:09.902 --> 24:11.917
Now, I don't see any evidence
of a murder here.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.834
He's dead.
I know it.

24:13.867 --> 24:15.433
The canasta game.

24:15.868 --> 24:16.937
Plus!

24:16.996 --> 24:18.934
I found his cat
starving this morning.

24:18.967 --> 24:20.476
How do you explain that?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.250
Why don't you
wait downstairs, Mrs. Kennedy?

24:28.308 --> 24:30.281
And we'll take a look
around for you.

24:31.988 --> 24:33.071
Thank you.

24:50.178 --> 24:51.469
What are you doing?

24:51.950 --> 24:53.030
Background music.

24:56.943 --> 25:00.167
You know, they don't keep
playing the same thing over and over.

25:00.341 --> 25:01.691
Sure, they do.

25:06.001 --> 25:07.395
Hard to concentrate.

25:07.769 --> 25:08.931
Isn't it?

25:17.719 --> 25:18.894
Hey, Randy.

25:19.433 --> 25:20.574
Look at this.

25:21.647 --> 25:22.767
What do you got?

25:22.995 --> 25:24.122
Makeup kit.

25:26.398 --> 25:27.643
Bandages.

25:30.317 --> 25:31.773
Skin Disease.

25:32.677 --> 25:34.626
That's interesting
bedtime reading.

25:36.310 --> 25:37.461
His appointment book.

25:38.567 --> 25:40.506
Looking pretty busy
every weekend.

25:41.328 --> 25:42.455
Captain, look at this.

25:42.713 --> 25:46.135
Last New Year's Eve, he played
a private party for Mandy Bronson.

25:59.370 --> 26:01.500
Boy, this must be
the best first date

26:01.533 --> 26:02.901
in the history
of first dates.

26:02.934 --> 26:04.667
Maybe we should quit
while we're ahead.

26:06.134 --> 26:08.334
I'm so glad your boss
needed my help.

26:08.368 --> 26:09.800
Mm, me, too.

26:10.326 --> 26:11.717
Whatever happened
with that case?

26:11.775 --> 26:12.867
Oh, it's over.

26:12.961 --> 26:15.408
Bronson went back
to his leper colony on Camino Island.

26:15.444 --> 26:16.770
He says he loves it there.

26:16.911 --> 26:17.921
Really?

26:18.791 --> 26:20.294
Well, you know,
I can believe it.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.184
I've seen some colonies
in Africa.

26:22.233 --> 26:24.066
They're like four-star hotels.

26:24.392 --> 26:25.867
You really are an expert.

26:25.901 --> 26:27.418
Well, I should be.

26:28.033 --> 26:29.111
Why is that?

26:29.193 --> 26:31.855
Well, you remember
I said I knew one person with leprosy?

26:33.006 --> 26:34.613
- It was me.
- What was you?

26:34.930 --> 26:36.368
I had it as a kid.

26:36.398 --> 26:39.168
Leprosy.
Hansen's disease.

26:49.098 --> 26:50.800
Well, don't worry.
I'm completely cured.

26:52.922 --> 26:54.867
Yeah, actually,
it's why I became a doctor.

26:55.332 --> 26:56.669
Oh.
Yeah.

26:57.479 --> 26:59.428
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.023
Really.

27:02.340 --> 27:03.596
Imagine that.

27:06.710 --> 27:07.825
Okay.

27:08.605 --> 27:10.467
- What are you doing?
- Making a snack.

27:10.605 --> 27:11.667
Oh, no.

27:13.301 --> 27:15.273
No, I promised your mother.

27:15.513 --> 27:16.578
No junk food.

27:16.977 --> 27:18.360
- You promised?
- Yeah.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.426
I am the babysitter.

27:21.895 --> 27:22.917
I don't think so.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.970
My mom said
I was babysitting you.

27:25.123 --> 27:26.234
Okay.

27:26.518 --> 27:27.728
Are you getting paid?

27:28.218 --> 27:29.634
- Yeah.
- How much?

27:31.533 --> 27:34.205
You know, that's
between your mother and me.

27:37.234 --> 27:38.767
Why?
How much are you getting?

27:39.263 --> 27:40.667
$8 an hour.

27:42.201 --> 27:43.467
An hour?

27:46.401 --> 27:47.810
I guess you're the sitter.

27:48.927 --> 27:50.301
Enjoy your fries.

27:52.468 --> 27:55.667
"Since 1840."
Who needed ketchup in 1840?

27:57.901 --> 27:59.079
The security panel.

27:59.818 --> 28:00.904
Pardon me?

28:00.975 --> 28:03.082
The security panel
in Bronson's house!

28:03.223 --> 28:05.767
Bendis Security, founded 2003.

28:06.163 --> 28:08.504
The leper said
he hadn't been home in seven years.

28:08.527 --> 28:10.688
How did he know
about that alarm system?

28:11.487 --> 28:13.072
Julie, I was duped.

28:13.856 --> 28:15.876
It was all a con.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.527
A "leper-con."

28:18.844 --> 28:21.101
- What?
- Was he magically delicious?

28:21.649 --> 28:23.533
Okay, thanks.
I'll talk to you later. Bye!

28:24.207 --> 28:25.334
- Natalie!
- Oh, God.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.438
Natalie, listen.

28:26.492 --> 28:27.542
Mom.

28:32.102 --> 28:33.767
Hotter!
Need it hotter.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.034
But Mom, are you okay?

28:35.067 --> 28:36.301
I'm fine, honey.

28:36.466 --> 28:38.121
How was the date?
Oh, it was great.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.433
Sweetheart,
I need you to do me something.

28:40.467 --> 28:42.952
I need you to go upstairs
and fill the bathtub with Listerine.

28:42.976 --> 28:43.950
Go, go, go, go, go!

28:43.974 --> 28:45.882
- Listen to this.
- I gotta tell you something.

28:45.905 --> 28:47.214
- We've been duped!
- I've been duped!

28:47.249 --> 28:49.093
Are you ready for this?
You're not gonna believe this.

28:49.116 --> 28:50.525
He's not a leper.
He's a leper!

28:51.633 --> 28:52.784
Oh, God.

28:59.966 --> 29:01.892
You have the camera?
You better have the camera.

29:01.915 --> 29:03.019
What are we looking for?

29:03.054 --> 29:04.639
Evidence, proof, anything.

29:04.723 --> 29:06.602
Oh, how could I not
have seen it?

29:06.696 --> 29:08.422
Derek Bronson
is not a leper.

29:08.434 --> 29:09.479
Hey, watch it.

29:09.502 --> 29:10.864
Derek Bronson is dead.

29:10.888 --> 29:13.060
His wife killed him
seven years ago.

29:13.344 --> 29:15.767
And she's been living
off his money ever since.

29:15.801 --> 29:17.771
I mean, she--
Watch the shoes.

29:18.636 --> 29:21.701
She knew that when he
was declared dead officially,

29:21.917 --> 29:22.968
the will would kick in,

29:23.000 --> 29:24.767
the nephews would get everything,

29:24.801 --> 29:26.420
and the party would be over.

29:26.919 --> 29:30.265
So she found someone
who resembled Derek.

29:30.301 --> 29:33.041
And she either hired him
or seduced him

29:33.276 --> 29:35.377
to suddenly "reappear."

29:38.701 --> 29:39.868
Will you please?

29:40.268 --> 29:41.395
That's why they chose me.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.400
Adrian Monk,
the perfect patsy.

29:43.434 --> 29:44.659
They knew about my problems.

29:44.729 --> 29:46.837
They knew I'd never take
a good look at the guy.

29:47.013 --> 29:49.414
So there never really was a leper.

29:49.672 --> 29:52.067
Except for the guy you were
making out with all night.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.061
Are you drinking that?

29:56.423 --> 29:58.934
Where's the woman who's been
lecturing me all week

29:58.968 --> 30:00.760
about compassion
and tolerance?

30:00.783 --> 30:03.218
It's not funny. You didn't have
your tongue down his throat.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.950
I shook hands with one.
That's bad enough.

30:04.962 --> 30:06.394
Your leper wasn't even a real leper.

30:06.418 --> 30:08.438
I thought he was real.
My leper was the real deal.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.256
That's what counts.
You know the old saying,

30:10.279 --> 30:14.175
There is no heart so black as the black,
black heart of the phony leper?

30:14.366 --> 30:16.901
- No, I never heard that one.
- Well, it's a saying. Up you go.

30:16.919 --> 30:18.040
- Up you go.
- Up you.

30:18.064 --> 30:19.050
- Up.
- Go.

30:19.085 --> 30:20.130
Go.

30:25.662 --> 30:27.234
- What if she's home?
- She's not home.

30:27.267 --> 30:28.954
We've been calling the house
all morning.

30:28.978 --> 30:30.362
- You still have the key?
- Yeah.

30:33.888 --> 30:35.074
What is that?

30:43.702 --> 30:45.337
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

31:38.267 --> 31:39.288
Can I help you?

31:39.347 --> 31:40.615
Oh, no, I'm just browsing.

31:41.592 --> 31:42.719
Browsing for what?

31:44.416 --> 31:45.884
Oh, did I say browsing?

31:46.389 --> 31:47.739
No, I'm-- I'm waiting.

31:47.774 --> 31:49.617
I'm just--
just waiting for someone.

32:55.896 --> 32:58.886
Randall.
What a nice...surprise.

32:58.983 --> 33:00.072
Hey, Doc.

33:01.934 --> 33:03.261
This fell off the wall.

33:04.168 --> 33:05.976
Right.
Yeah.

33:06.923 --> 33:08.062
Not to worry.

33:08.802 --> 33:10.070
We'll just toss it.

33:10.783 --> 33:11.875
- Thanks.
- That's okay.

33:11.933 --> 33:13.060
Well, you're looking good.

33:14.314 --> 33:15.347
Thanks.

33:16.044 --> 33:18.721
Well, uh...
I'll, uh...see you around.

33:19.094 --> 33:21.299
- Take care.
- Oh, hey, I, uh,

33:21.488 --> 33:23.261
I hear you're dating
a friend of mine.

33:23.339 --> 33:24.434
Natalie Teeger.

33:24.551 --> 33:26.453
Oh, yeah, she's amazing.

33:27.862 --> 33:29.799
But I don't think
it's gonna happen.

33:30.027 --> 33:32.885
Well, she reacted pretty badly
when I told her I used to have leprosy.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.205
Really?

33:35.393 --> 33:36.603
She couldn't handle it, huh?

33:36.650 --> 33:37.683
No.

33:38.590 --> 33:39.705
Some people.

33:40.104 --> 33:42.173
Actually, I-I've been trying
to reach her

33:42.326 --> 33:43.641
to give her a heads up.

33:44.193 --> 33:46.018
I think Derek Bronson lied to her.

33:46.053 --> 33:47.991
He told her he's been
living on Camino Island.

33:48.014 --> 33:49.188
But I checked this morning,

33:49.235 --> 33:52.683
and it turns out the leper colony there
has been closed for two years.

33:52.741 --> 33:53.810
Really?

33:54.635 --> 33:57.253
I mean, maybe that guy
wasn't really Bronson.

33:57.378 --> 33:58.952
I mean, all those bandages.

33:59.279 --> 34:01.134
Well, no, I mean,
the wife met him.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.744
It's funny, though.
We--

34:03.972 --> 34:05.901
We're working on another case,
missing persons.

34:05.934 --> 34:07.770
We were gonna talk
to Monk about it.

34:08.103 --> 34:11.708
We found a makeup kit
and a book on skin diseases.

34:16.109 --> 34:18.668
I think I'm gonna stop by
and have a chat with the wife.

34:19.321 --> 34:20.484
Thanks, Doc.

34:20.569 --> 34:21.813
Can I come with you?

34:21.884 --> 34:24.358
It-- it-- if Natalie is in trouble,
I'd just--

34:25.174 --> 34:26.418
I'd like to be there.

34:27.656 --> 34:29.924
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, that's great. Thank you.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.534
Why don't we, uh,
take separate cars?

34:31.567 --> 34:32.621
Randy, I'm not contagious.

34:32.679 --> 34:33.911
No, that's not what I meant.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.274
Is that what you thought I meant?

34:35.310 --> 34:37.286
- I mean, is that what you--
- Seemed like that.

34:54.231 --> 34:55.277
Hello?

34:55.748 --> 34:56.899
Can't it wait?

34:57.085 --> 34:58.331
Hold on.

35:31.495 --> 35:32.716
Oh, my God.

35:33.115 --> 35:34.477
Why all the barbells?

35:34.634 --> 35:35.634
Weights.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.401
She's gonna dump him
in the ocean.

35:37.667 --> 35:40.151
Probably did the same thing
seven years ago to her husband.

35:40.186 --> 35:41.334
I know this guy.

35:41.367 --> 35:42.604
He's the leper.

35:42.851 --> 35:44.997
- He's not my leper.
- No, he's my leper.

35:45.569 --> 35:47.236
We better call it in.
Give me your phone.

35:47.260 --> 35:48.868
No, no.
There's no time. Here she comes.

35:48.901 --> 35:49.896
Come on, that way!

35:49.920 --> 35:51.548
- No, we'll never make it!
- That way!

35:52.088 --> 35:53.569
- That way.
- I don't think so.

35:53.595 --> 35:54.687
No, come on.

35:58.086 --> 35:59.307
Alright, get up!

36:02.338 --> 36:03.711
Help me unhook them.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.234
- Hurry!
- Throw the ropes!

36:05.246 --> 36:06.334
Do something!

36:07.132 --> 36:08.181
We're moving.

36:08.239 --> 36:09.284
Hurry!

36:10.002 --> 36:11.968
- Mr. Monk, take the ropes down.
- Faster!

36:12.422 --> 36:14.207
- Faster!
- I'm trying.

36:15.387 --> 36:16.914
- That's good.
- Go, go, go.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.334
Now it's good.
Okay, okay.

36:18.367 --> 36:19.801
Here we go.
Do something!

36:19.834 --> 36:21.046
I'm trying.

36:21.610 --> 36:23.160
<i>We're too high.</i>

36:26.100 --> 36:27.067
Stay down!

36:30.261 --> 36:31.599
We're too high!

36:37.174 --> 36:38.489
Stay down, I said!

36:40.785 --> 36:42.167
Police officer!
Put your gun down!

36:42.200 --> 36:44.107
Wait, it's Randy.
He's with somebody.

36:44.152 --> 36:45.324
Drop the gun!

36:45.853 --> 36:47.039
It's my leper.

36:48.095 --> 36:49.701
Too low, too low.
We're too low!

36:49.734 --> 36:51.100
We're too low, we're too low.

36:51.133 --> 36:52.405
Put the gun down now!

36:52.456 --> 36:53.431
Now!

36:53.474 --> 36:55.873
Down on your knees,
and put your hands in front of you.

36:55.899 --> 36:58.501
Down on your knees, and put
your hands in front of you. Now!

36:58.534 --> 36:59.645
Now!

37:08.452 --> 37:09.637
<i>We're too low!</i>

37:09.767 --> 37:10.941
We're too low.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.434
We're too low!

37:13.832 --> 37:15.581
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

37:18.649 --> 37:19.882
We're too low!

37:20.223 --> 37:21.562
We're too low!

37:22.067 --> 37:23.516
We're gonna crash!

38:01.755 --> 38:03.140
Mr. Monk, where are you?

38:17.646 --> 38:19.161
I'm down here!

38:19.337 --> 38:20.429
Down--

38:20.758 --> 38:22.219
down here!

38:23.497 --> 38:24.667
Take my hand.

38:29.228 --> 38:30.344
You can do it.

38:34.625 --> 38:35.717
Is there--

38:36.530 --> 38:37.998
Is there anybody else...

38:38.468 --> 38:39.615
up there?

38:41.267 --> 38:43.933
Could you look around please?

38:44.015 --> 38:46.100
Take my hand,
or you'll die!

38:58.294 --> 38:59.914
I'm...thinking.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.745
Please, please.

39:05.367 --> 39:06.767
Take my hand.

39:10.667 --> 39:12.096
Come on.
That's it.

39:15.032 --> 39:17.033
Come on.
Come up here.

39:22.143 --> 39:24.133
Give me your other hand.
I've got you.

39:32.969 --> 39:33.932
Well.

39:35.482 --> 39:36.762
<i>What's the matter?</i>

39:48.370 --> 39:50.143
Hey, is the necklace too much?

39:50.419 --> 39:51.460
Mom, you look hot.

39:51.496 --> 39:52.893
You must really like this guy.

39:53.638 --> 39:54.741
You're not scared?

39:54.800 --> 39:56.291
No, why would I be scared?

39:56.338 --> 39:57.782
Well, um, Mr. Monk,
he said--

39:57.806 --> 39:59.602
We can't all live
by Mr. Monk's rules.

39:59.661 --> 40:01.186
What kind of world
would this be?

40:10.704 --> 40:12.791
- Am I late?
- No, you're right on time.

40:12.835 --> 40:13.907
You're perfect.

40:14.036 --> 40:15.201
Well, these are for you.

40:15.234 --> 40:16.301
Oh, thank you.

40:16.334 --> 40:17.413
And...

40:17.633 --> 40:19.044
Oh-- oh, gosh.

40:20.172 --> 40:22.368
Sorry. Give me a little time.
Work in progress.

40:22.403 --> 40:24.728
Yeah, well, you take
all the time you want.

40:25.468 --> 40:27.931
- Come on in.
- Okay, thank you.

40:31.731 --> 40:33.058
Uh, is that Monk?

40:33.176 --> 40:35.301
Adrian.
Did you get my message?

40:35.334 --> 40:37.234
Hey, Doc.
I meant to call you.

40:37.267 --> 40:39.546
I'm not much of a golfer,
but thanks for the invite.

40:40.922 --> 40:42.143
What are you cooking?

40:42.195 --> 40:43.923
Maybe we should stay in tonight.

40:45.352 --> 40:47.763
You go have fun. You go out.
Go, go, go, go, go.

40:50.500 --> 40:53.024
I've got a little bit of a cold.
I'd hate for you to catch it,

40:53.048 --> 40:54.175
and I just mopped the floor.

40:54.187 --> 40:56.114
- I got a little bit of a cold.
- Cold?

40:56.172 --> 40:57.664
And I just mopped the floor.

40:58.392 --> 40:59.613
Yeah, okay.

40:59.648 --> 41:01.879
I'll, uh,
I'll catch you next time.

41:01.914 --> 41:03.182
Catch you next time.

41:03.581 --> 41:04.931
Okay.
All right.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.458
Oh, Aaron, I want you
to meet somebody.

41:07.564 --> 41:08.903
This is Julie.

41:10.562 --> 41:12.276
It's a pleasure to meet you.

41:12.335 --> 41:13.544
It's nice to meet you, too.

41:13.568 --> 41:15.751
I've heard a lot about you.

41:21.871 --> 41:23.057
Yeah.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.908
Well, uh,
shall we get going?

41:37.855 --> 41:39.217
- Take care.
- Bye.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.073
Shall we?

41:42.177 --> 41:43.492
Mr. Monk.
