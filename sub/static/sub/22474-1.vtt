01:36.850 --> 01:37.950
Damn it.

01:37.980 --> 01:39.450
Here, let me do that.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.450
No, I'll fix it.

01:41.490 --> 01:42.880
You'll just
re-injure your back

01:42.920 --> 01:44.226
and we'll be screwed
for another year.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.750
Becca, I told you, I'll do it.

01:46.790 --> 01:48.920
The doctor said I'm good
to go back to work.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.460
It's about time.

01:50.490 --> 01:52.790
Your workers' comp.
Ran out two months ago.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.960
Babe, you need to relax
about all this stuff.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.170
Okay?

01:57.200 --> 02:00.070
I told you,
it's gonna be okay.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.870
And we can start trying
again to get pregnant.

02:07.310 --> 02:08.910
It's gonna happen.

02:15.190 --> 02:16.450
That's my girl.

02:16.490 --> 02:18.120
And...

02:18.160 --> 02:20.190
there's no time
like the present

02:20.220 --> 02:21.460
to start trying again.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.320
There's no time, period.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.030
I have to go to work.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.930
I hate to burst your bubble,

02:28.970 --> 02:31.030
but this whole
infertility thing,

02:31.070 --> 02:32.630
it might not be me.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.200
I know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get checked out.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.870
You said that before.

02:36.910 --> 02:38.170
I mean it this time.

02:38.210 --> 02:39.840
I am.

02:39.880 --> 02:43.110
Oh, don't forget, we got to go
to Max and Mindy's tomorrow.

02:43.150 --> 02:44.950
Okay, I'm going to work.

02:49.290 --> 02:50.790
Love you too.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.970
Hi.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.170
I swear,
I still need a G.P.S.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.800
to make my way
around this place.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.170
See? I told you, darling.

03:10.210 --> 03:11.850
The guests should
use the maid's bathroom.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.410
It's so much closer.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.010
Have our guests use
the help's bathroom?

03:16.050 --> 03:17.150
No, not in my house.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.210
Our house, darling.
It's our house.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.650
See, honey? Now you've
started an argument.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.690
Mindy and I don't argue... ever.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.420
You know, that's actually true.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.720
You don't argue?

03:26.760 --> 03:30.530
No way.
Every couple argues.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.560
I hate to be blunt,
but it's because we're rich.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.730
Max!

03:34.760 --> 03:36.330
- What?
- That's so gauche.

03:36.370 --> 03:39.330
He's become
so obnoxious lately,

03:39.370 --> 03:42.040
ever since he closed that
real-estate deal on Rodeo Drive.

03:42.070 --> 03:45.840
Oh, he's been doing that
ever since our fraternity days.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.840
- He's humble bragging.
- Look, all I'm saying

03:47.880 --> 03:49.680
is that, statistically,
the number one thing

03:49.710 --> 03:51.410
couples argue about
the most is money,

03:51.450 --> 03:53.050
or the lack thereof.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.420
So if you take
that off the table,

03:55.450 --> 03:57.550
what else is there
to argue about?

03:57.590 --> 03:59.750
Like I said before, Ron,

03:59.790 --> 04:02.590
if you ever need a little help,
all you have to do is ask.

04:02.630 --> 04:05.760
And like I said before,
don't be ridiculous.

04:07.230 --> 04:09.400
You know, all I need
is one big construction job

04:09.430 --> 04:10.800
and we'll be flush again.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.570
And once he's done
redoing the loft,

04:12.600 --> 04:14.100
we're gonna
flip it for a fortune.

04:14.140 --> 04:16.070
So don't you worry.

04:16.110 --> 04:17.240
We'll be fine.

04:21.649 --> 04:24.210
Mindy, I really like
your new hair.

04:24.250 --> 04:25.950
Oh, thanks.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.950
You know, it is so
true what they say,

04:27.980 --> 04:30.590
blondes have way more fun.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.420
Hope our husbands
don't get us confused.

04:33.620 --> 04:34.920
Speaking of which...

04:37.530 --> 04:38.930
how's your sex life these days?

04:40.660 --> 04:42.660
Uh, it's... it's...
İt's great.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.330
- Yeah?
- Yeah, no complaints.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.370
Yeah, couldn't be better.

04:46.570 --> 04:47.670
That's what you think.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.570
So being rich gives you
guys better sex too?

04:53.610 --> 04:54.610
Come on, guys.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.910
Yeah, what's with you two today?

04:56.950 --> 05:00.180
Well, actually,
that's the point.

05:00.220 --> 05:03.690
You see,
it's not just us two.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.750
What's not just us two?

05:05.790 --> 05:07.420
Yeah, what are
you talking about?

05:07.460 --> 05:11.790
Mindy and I have been
on an extraordinary adventure.

05:11.830 --> 05:15.100
We've... opened our marriage.

05:15.130 --> 05:18.800
It's a whole new glorious world.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.140
Wait, so... so you guys are
having sex with other people?

05:22.170 --> 05:24.340
Yes, we are.

05:27.640 --> 05:32.110
Isn't that dangerous?
Like playing with fire?

05:32.150 --> 05:35.220
Mm, it is, but playing with
fire is what makes it so hot.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.650
Until you get burned.

05:38.690 --> 05:40.136
That's where
the rules come in, sweetie.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.620
We have our limits.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.406
I mean, I never thought
I would ever do this.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.330
I'm the one that demanded a
cheating clause in our prenup.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.130
Which was
completely unnecessary.

05:48.160 --> 05:52.630
But as long as you
follow the rules that you make,

05:52.670 --> 05:54.040
nobody gets hurt.

05:54.070 --> 05:56.700
- Rules?
- Yeah, like what?

05:58.480 --> 06:03.210
Like, for example,
our number one rule is...

06:04.250 --> 06:06.650
No extracurricular activities

06:06.680 --> 06:09.020
- without the other person.
- Boom.

06:09.050 --> 06:10.180
Really?

06:10.220 --> 06:12.890
And practice safe sex,
of course?

06:12.920 --> 06:14.720
- Of course.
- Of course, of course.

06:16.530 --> 06:17.690
Wow.

06:17.730 --> 06:19.530
You know what,
it's getting really late.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.230
I think we should get going.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.200
Suit yourself.

06:23.230 --> 06:26.070
I just have a really
early morning tomorrow.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.270
Yeah, we'll, uh, we'll continue
this discussion another time.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.070
Hope we didn't
scare you off.

06:49.330 --> 06:51.260
So what'd you think?

06:52.730 --> 06:54.100
You go first.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.330
Morning, babe.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.860
Morning.

08:03.130 --> 08:05.870
So Mindy was in
rare form last night.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.040
Were you as
surprised as I was

08:08.070 --> 08:10.970
about their
extracurricular activities?

08:11.010 --> 08:14.010
Yeah, completely. I didn't
think they were that type.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.310
Are we?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.250
Are we what?

08:22.650 --> 08:23.680
The type?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.820
I mean...

08:25.860 --> 08:27.320
I don't...

08:27.360 --> 08:28.820
I... I just...

08:28.860 --> 08:31.960
Come on, be honest.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.860
You clearly
got excited about the idea.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.870
Well, you were
obviously excited yourself.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.200
'Cause it was
hot to think about.

08:41.740 --> 08:45.010
But I don't know
if I could actually do it.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.156
I mean, I would never do
anything you didn't want to do.

08:47.180 --> 08:49.910
You know I would
never do anything to hurt you.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.250
I know.

08:55.180 --> 08:57.150
I mean, maybe it would
be a welcome distraction.

08:57.190 --> 08:58.390
From?

08:58.420 --> 09:00.890
You know, stuff.

09:02.290 --> 09:04.060
Yeah.

09:04.090 --> 09:06.260
Stuff's been
pretty rough lately.

09:08.060 --> 09:11.530
Obviously...
it would be entirely up to you.

09:11.570 --> 09:13.000
Great.

09:13.040 --> 09:17.000
So, if it doesn't go right,
then it's all on me.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.540
Yeah, I mean I wasn't
seriously considering it.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.410
Yeah, right.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.120
I don't know if you noticed,
but I finally finished

09:34.160 --> 09:35.920
stripping the paint off
the brick yesterday.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.730
Are we still scheduled
to move out in March?

09:40.230 --> 09:42.100
Probably more like
May or June.

09:42.130 --> 09:44.130
It's a better time
to flip properties then anyway.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.040
I know it's no big deal to you,

09:48.070 --> 09:51.370
but I'm having a harder time
with this uncertainty.

09:52.510 --> 09:53.940
You mean about
money coming in?

09:53.980 --> 09:55.780
That's part of it.

09:57.350 --> 09:59.150
Please, babe,
don't rub it in.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.966
I feel guilty enough that you have to
work double shifts at the hospital.

10:01.990 --> 10:04.150
Ron, look at me.

10:04.190 --> 10:07.150
It's my turn
to be the breadwinner.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.790
I'm okay with that.

10:08.830 --> 10:09.830
Really.

10:11.590 --> 10:12.660
Than what is it?

10:14.330 --> 10:17.400
Someday I'd like to feel
like our home is our home,

10:17.430 --> 10:20.670
and if we're ever able
to start a family,

10:20.700 --> 10:23.400
I don't want
to be so transient.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.310
I'm sorry, honey.

10:28.340 --> 10:31.610
Maybe Max and Mindy
have the right idea.

10:31.650 --> 10:33.750
About open relationships?

10:35.050 --> 10:37.350
No, about money solving stuff.

10:37.390 --> 10:38.990
Oh, that.

10:39.020 --> 10:41.120
Yeah.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.520
I see what you mean.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.160
All right,
I got to get to work.

10:45.190 --> 10:46.190
Okay.

10:53.170 --> 10:55.000
Wait a minute.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.310
Last night was the first time that
you and Ron had sex in three months?

10:58.340 --> 11:00.140
Yeah.

11:00.180 --> 11:01.716
I thought you two
were trying to have a baby,

11:01.740 --> 11:03.610
a lot, like bunnies.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.110
We are.
Well, we were.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.850
I guess we are again.

11:08.890 --> 11:12.390
Okay, well, that's good,
but why the sudden change?

11:13.760 --> 11:14.920
I don't know.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.890
Come on, spill it.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.560
Okay, so last night,

11:22.600 --> 11:24.376
we went up to our
rich friend's house in Malibu,

11:24.400 --> 11:28.900
and they suggested that
we... try opening...

11:31.010 --> 11:32.210
A lemonade stand?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.770
No.

11:33.810 --> 11:38.050
Okay, that Ron and I
try opening up our marriage.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.880
Oh.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.750
This just got interesting.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.520
You know,
to like spice things up.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.160
Hmm.

11:49.190 --> 11:51.530
So you two had a four-way
with Max and Mindy last night.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.990
No!
We just talked about it.

11:54.030 --> 11:56.260
Okay.
I believe you.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.070
Then what happened?

12:00.300 --> 12:02.000
Then I guess the conversation

12:02.040 --> 12:03.800
just got Ron and I
a little frisky.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.540
And when we got home,
you know, things just...

12:08.640 --> 12:09.910
kinda happened.

12:09.950 --> 12:12.010
So, you were
turned on by the idea?

12:12.050 --> 12:15.580
I never thought
I'd say this, but...

12:15.620 --> 12:16.680
yeah.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.390
And if I'm being
completely honest,

12:18.420 --> 12:21.120
I'm kind of intrigued.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.420
- And so was Ron?
- Well, yeah, he's a guy.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.890
Remember?

12:24.930 --> 12:26.530
Trust me, I remember.

12:28.770 --> 12:31.230
So... what do you think?

12:31.270 --> 12:34.200
Well, in gay-land,

12:34.240 --> 12:37.770
open relationships
are pretty normal...

12:37.810 --> 12:42.310
unless you're ugly, in which case,
nobody wants to have sex with you.

12:42.350 --> 12:44.110
Tough crowd.

12:44.150 --> 12:46.610
But seriously,
between two men,

12:46.650 --> 12:50.050
we, you know,
we get it.

12:50.090 --> 12:51.950
Get what?

12:51.990 --> 12:54.560
That love and lust
are two different things.

12:56.990 --> 12:58.260
Sex is sex.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.160
I'd feel threatened
if I watched Ron

13:02.200 --> 13:03.460
have sex with another woman.

13:04.930 --> 13:06.300
A loving,
trusting relationship

13:06.340 --> 13:09.100
doesn't have
to feel threatened by...

13:09.140 --> 13:10.300
opening things up.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.940
In fact,
it can strengthen it.

13:11.970 --> 13:13.570
How?

13:13.610 --> 13:16.510
Well, by experiencing
something exciting together,

13:16.550 --> 13:18.050
as a team.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.350
But now that you're married,
it's different right?

13:20.380 --> 13:21.620
Not at all.

13:21.650 --> 13:23.450
Gary and I have
an open marriage.

13:24.490 --> 13:25.920
You do?!

13:25.960 --> 13:27.920
Sure.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.360
And you may want
to close your mouth

13:29.390 --> 13:30.690
before a fly lands in there.

13:31.990 --> 13:33.030
You never told me that.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.460
You never asked.

13:36.970 --> 13:39.970
You guys just seem so happy
and so committed.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.200
That's the point.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.670
We are.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.340
And you never get jealous?

13:45.370 --> 13:48.040
- No.
- Not at all.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.510
What you need to do is have a
conversation with the rich wife.

13:51.550 --> 13:53.180
- Mindy.
- Yeah.

13:53.220 --> 13:56.850
You need to have a one-on-one
with her woman to woman.

13:56.890 --> 13:59.690
Make sure that you two
are on the same page.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.390
So come on.

14:05.430 --> 14:06.930
Spit it out.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.600
Your lunch break isn't long
enough to beat around the bush.

14:09.630 --> 14:12.930
Okay, so I wanted
to talk to you about the...

14:12.970 --> 14:14.340
Our salacious proposition

14:14.370 --> 14:16.570
for you and your hot,
juicy slab of a husband?

14:16.610 --> 14:17.640
Yes.

14:17.670 --> 14:20.140
The whole idea
just seems so...

14:20.180 --> 14:21.440
naughty.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.940
And, I mean,
I wasn't a prude

14:22.980 --> 14:24.680
before I married Ron,
or anything.

14:24.710 --> 14:27.510
Hmm... a little bit
of a late bloomer,

14:27.550 --> 14:29.450
but you made up
for lost time.

14:29.490 --> 14:31.790
Yeah, well, Ron is
definitely open to it.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.590
Though, he's trying to hide
how open to it he is.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.660
I know how it goes.
Trust me.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.590
When Max first suggested it,

14:38.630 --> 14:40.090
I almost slugged him.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.160
Slugged him?

14:41.200 --> 14:43.100
I thought you don't fight.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.600
We don't.
I just hit him sometimes,

14:46.640 --> 14:47.970
but I don't leave a mark.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Really?

14:50.010 --> 14:51.240
I'm kidding!

14:51.270 --> 14:52.510
What is up with you today?

14:56.210 --> 14:58.180
Didn't you worry
when he brought it up?

14:58.210 --> 15:00.610
Didn't... didn't it
make you feel insecure?

15:01.820 --> 15:04.150
First, I don't do insecure,

15:04.190 --> 15:07.390
and second, neither one of us
would ever dream of cheating.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.020
Why is that?

15:09.060 --> 15:11.160
Because of our prenup, silly.

15:11.190 --> 15:12.660
If I get caught cheating,

15:12.700 --> 15:14.076
I get kicked to the curb
with nothing.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.960
And if he gets caught cheating,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.830
I take him to the cleaners.

15:17.870 --> 15:20.730
So, an open marriage
is not considered cheating?

15:22.170 --> 15:24.870
Nope.
Our arrangement

15:24.910 --> 15:26.970
is that we experience
everything together.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.410
So, there's no cheating,
there's no lying.

15:30.450 --> 15:32.650
There's no secrecy.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.896
I don't know. I just don't know
if Ron and I's relationship

15:34.920 --> 15:36.920
is on solid enough
ground right now.

15:36.950 --> 15:39.690
I'd be afraid it would
drive us further apart.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.320
What's going on
with you two?

15:45.630 --> 15:49.700
This past year has just been
a perfect storm of problems.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.070
Look...

15:52.200 --> 15:53.500
I didn't want
to tell you this

15:53.540 --> 15:54.716
'cause I didn't
want you to worry,

15:54.740 --> 15:56.570
but just last year,

15:56.610 --> 15:58.440
Max and I were
headed for divorce.

15:58.470 --> 15:59.870
Really?

16:01.240 --> 16:02.280
You covered it well.

16:02.310 --> 16:04.610
I'm good at that.

16:04.650 --> 16:08.720
Anyway, we decided to try
this whole open relationship,

16:08.750 --> 16:11.750
and the most amazing
thing happened.

16:11.790 --> 16:17.360
It rekindled the spark
that had gone from our marriage.

16:17.390 --> 16:19.260
We're happier now
than we've ever been.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.690
Huh.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.030
So...

16:25.170 --> 16:27.030
no pressure,

16:27.070 --> 16:28.816
but I hope you give this
some serious thought.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.140
It worked for us,

16:30.170 --> 16:31.746
and it just might work
for the two of you.

16:31.770 --> 16:33.740
I consider you
my best friend.

16:33.780 --> 16:36.710
I didn't know
you thought so highly of me.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.910
I'm... I'm honored.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.260
My fertility test came back.

16:50.290 --> 16:52.730
Oh? And?

16:52.760 --> 16:56.100
The doctor says I have a 1%
chance of having children.

16:58.530 --> 17:00.230
I'm sorry to hear it, pal.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.270
Are you okay?

17:02.300 --> 17:04.000
At least I know now

17:04.040 --> 17:05.510
what it's like
to be part of the 1%.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.740
Ha-ha-ha.

17:06.780 --> 17:07.839
Very funny.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.810
How's Becca taking it?

17:11.310 --> 17:13.310
- I haven't told her.
- Why not?

17:13.349 --> 17:15.450
Just don't say
anything, all right?

17:15.480 --> 17:16.650
Especially to Mindy.

17:16.690 --> 17:18.250
I don't think I can handle

17:18.290 --> 17:21.119
telling Becca one more
piece of bad news right now.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.660
She deserves to know.

17:22.690 --> 17:23.819
I'm gonna tell her...

17:23.859 --> 17:25.960
when I get
a construction job.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.500
At least then she'll see me
as successful at something.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.660
Come on, you're being
too hard on yourself.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.940
No, I'm not. Man, she could
decide to leave me over this.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.200
That's crazy talk.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.440
You two are
the happiest couple I know.

17:37.510 --> 17:38.940
Not lately.

17:38.970 --> 17:42.340
We had sex for the first time
in months the other night.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.710
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.310
The night you...

17:46.350 --> 17:48.780
You and Mindy told us about
that whole open marriage thing.

17:48.820 --> 17:50.280
What?

17:50.320 --> 17:52.220
Our little conversation

17:52.250 --> 17:53.530
got you two
all hot and bothered?

17:54.560 --> 17:56.060
I guess it kind of did.

17:56.090 --> 17:58.166
I don't think we're ready
to go through with it, though.

17:58.190 --> 17:59.490
Hey.

17:59.530 --> 18:00.890
Don't knock it.

18:00.930 --> 18:04.500
This open relationship
has brought me and Mindy closer.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.570
What about us, Max?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.500
Our friendship,
what would it do to us?

18:11.110 --> 18:12.210
It's just sex.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.180
Trust me.

18:15.210 --> 18:17.210
As long as everyone's
on the same page...

18:18.280 --> 18:19.710
no one gets hurt.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.480
No one gets hurt.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.900
My, my, we're popular.

19:09.730 --> 19:11.130
That's a first.

19:11.170 --> 19:12.270
Who's it from?

19:12.300 --> 19:13.300
Mindy.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.970
I got one from Max.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.540
Let me guess,
"Sleepover this Saturday"?

19:20.580 --> 19:21.940
That's it exactly.

19:24.980 --> 19:26.280
So what do you say?

19:27.580 --> 19:28.750
I don't know.

19:28.780 --> 19:30.320
What do you say?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.930
Are you sure about this?

19:47.470 --> 19:49.100
I'm sure I want to try it.

19:49.140 --> 19:51.170
Yeah, I know you do,
you naughty girl.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.140
- Remember the rules.
- Yeah, of course.

19:55.180 --> 19:56.786
Number one, we do nothing
without each other,

19:56.810 --> 19:58.880
and, number two,
if one of us wants to stop,

19:58.910 --> 20:00.750
we both stop,
no questions asked.

20:36.220 --> 20:40.490
This painting,
it's new, isn't it?

20:40.520 --> 20:43.560
Yes. Good eye.

20:43.590 --> 20:44.990
We acquired that

20:45.030 --> 20:47.130
at an auction
in Paris last year.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.800
I think it's hideous,
but Max likes it,

20:50.830 --> 20:52.870
so what do I know?

20:52.900 --> 20:55.240
I'm not an art critic.

20:55.270 --> 20:56.970
Ron...

20:57.010 --> 20:58.840
what do you think?

21:00.540 --> 21:01.910
Well, the colors are nice,

21:01.940 --> 21:04.410
but it's not really...

21:04.450 --> 21:05.810
Not really my style.

21:07.220 --> 21:09.020
See, Max? Ron agrees.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.250
So, Becca...

21:11.290 --> 21:13.150
not to put you
on the spot or anything,

21:13.190 --> 21:15.560
but whose side
are you on?

21:19.560 --> 21:21.090
Well, I like it.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.400
It's striking,

21:23.430 --> 21:25.770
and it commands your attention.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.240
I couldn't agree more.

23:01.930 --> 23:02.930
So what?

23:02.970 --> 23:04.260
What do you mean "so what"?

23:04.300 --> 23:06.570
We haven't even talked
about last night yet.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.040
What's there to talk about?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.240
Seriously?

23:12.470 --> 23:14.110
I know, I, uh...

23:16.610 --> 23:18.980
I don't know what to say?

23:20.250 --> 23:22.250
It brought up
a lot of mixed emotions.

23:23.850 --> 23:25.550
Yeah, I understand.

23:25.590 --> 23:26.920
We don't have
to do it again.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.160
No, that's...
not what I'm saying.

23:31.590 --> 23:32.660
Uh...

23:33.830 --> 23:36.260
Was it what you thought
it was gonna be?

23:36.300 --> 23:39.570
Did you ever see yourself
doing what we did?

23:42.440 --> 23:44.640
I mean, I thought about it
in a fantasy kind of way

23:44.670 --> 23:46.410
'cause I'm a guy.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.640
Really?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.580
I mean, the fantasy
was a little different.

23:51.050 --> 23:53.450
More women, less Max.

23:58.850 --> 24:00.520
How do you feel about it?

24:03.160 --> 24:05.090
You promise
you won't get mad?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.830
Sure.

24:07.860 --> 24:09.630
I thought it was really hot,

24:09.670 --> 24:11.870
and I can tell you did too.

24:14.470 --> 24:15.970
I did...

24:16.000 --> 24:18.270
but that's not the point.

24:18.310 --> 24:19.770
What's the point?

24:21.910 --> 24:23.810
I don't know.

24:26.250 --> 24:28.780
I'm just being a hypocrite.

24:28.820 --> 24:31.050
I enjoyed it
and you enjoyed it.

24:31.090 --> 24:32.490
So...

24:34.020 --> 24:35.720
So, we're good?

24:38.230 --> 24:39.230
We're good.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.390
Listen, there's something
I have to tell you.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.160
I don't want to jinx it,

25:11.190 --> 25:13.160
but I just put in a bid

25:13.200 --> 25:15.060
for a big construction job,

25:15.100 --> 25:18.200
a community center that's
being commissioned by the mayor.

25:18.230 --> 25:21.700
That's good.
I'm so proud of you.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.346
Yeah, I don't want
to get my hopes up too high,

25:23.370 --> 25:25.040
but I think I have
a real shot at this.

25:25.070 --> 25:26.670
That's great, sweetheart.

25:28.210 --> 25:30.180
Things are finally looking up.

25:44.490 --> 25:46.430
Guess what I got.

25:46.460 --> 25:48.300
Text from Max?

25:48.330 --> 25:49.330
Yup.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.460
Same here from Mindy.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.130
So what do you think?

25:53.170 --> 25:55.570
The alley door
behind Crowley's?

25:55.600 --> 25:58.200
They've certainly
got my curiosity up.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.750
Glad you decided to show.

26:08.780 --> 26:09.780
Are you ready?

26:13.760 --> 26:15.620
So what is this place?

26:16.790 --> 26:18.830
Open for Bizness.

26:18.860 --> 26:20.760
It's an underground club.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.300
- Mindy found it.
- There's this app called Caligula

26:23.330 --> 26:25.230
that shows
all the nearest hot spots

26:25.270 --> 26:27.670
for open-minded people like us.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.940
I wasn't expecting
to do this with total strangers.

26:30.970 --> 26:33.440
- Yeah...
- Stop worrying.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.740
You can just watch,
no pressure.

26:35.780 --> 26:37.180
Password?

26:38.380 --> 26:40.110
Kumquat.

26:52.130 --> 26:53.330
Welcome.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.810
I am Vulnavia,

27:13.850 --> 27:16.120
and we only have
three rules here.

27:16.150 --> 27:21.320
Number one, anything...
And I mean anything... goes.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.790
Number two,
if anything doesn't go,

27:23.830 --> 27:26.530
well, tonight's safe word
is "suspenders."

27:26.560 --> 27:29.660
And number three, have fun.

27:35.370 --> 27:37.240
Now down the hall
and to your left,

27:37.270 --> 27:39.840
is "Pandora's Labyrinth,"
but you know what?

27:39.880 --> 27:41.840
I don't think your friends
are ready for that yet.

27:42.710 --> 27:43.840
And this...

27:45.710 --> 27:47.550
is the "Meet & Greet Suite."

27:47.580 --> 27:48.580
So you know what?

27:49.720 --> 27:51.920
Why don't you, uh, meet...

27:52.990 --> 27:54.150
and greet.

28:00.430 --> 28:02.560
So what's your pleasure?

28:02.600 --> 28:04.200
Sex on the Beach?

28:04.230 --> 28:06.600
Or would you like
a cocktail first?

28:08.070 --> 28:09.200
That's a good one.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.940
Why thank you, baby.
Stick around.

28:10.970 --> 28:12.910
I got a million of 'em.

28:12.940 --> 28:14.300
Actually,
I'm not drinking tonight.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.540
- Really?
- In a place like this,

28:17.580 --> 28:19.210
I don't want
to dull my senses.

28:20.780 --> 28:21.880
I'm with you.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.550
Gentlemen?

28:23.590 --> 28:26.050
I'm designated driver.

28:26.090 --> 28:28.960
I guess I'll pass too.

28:31.260 --> 28:33.290
Suit yourselves.

28:33.330 --> 28:34.930
Galoshes anyone?

28:34.960 --> 28:37.560
Oh, yeah, good idea.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.530
How many of those do you
plan on using and with whom?

28:40.570 --> 28:42.540
Honey, they're free.
I'm just playing it cool.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.590
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

28:58.620 --> 29:00.320
It's too much.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.060
Yeah, no, babe,
I'm with you.

29:02.090 --> 29:03.320
Hey, hey.

29:04.490 --> 29:06.660
Relax,
we're just here to watch.

29:06.700 --> 29:09.230
You know, prime the pump.

29:09.260 --> 29:11.400
This is just
foreplay for our...

29:11.430 --> 29:13.430
foreplay.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.940
Let's go.

29:26.980 --> 29:28.180
It's so small.

29:28.220 --> 29:31.180
Oh, yeah,
it's kind of a tight fit.

29:31.220 --> 29:32.650
That's the idea.

29:32.690 --> 29:35.620
So, who wants to go first?

30:41.690 --> 30:42.820
Mindy?

30:42.860 --> 30:44.360
Mindy.

30:44.390 --> 30:46.690
- What is it, sexy?
- Where's Max and Becca?

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
Here, come on.

31:04.650 --> 31:07.950
Isn't rule number one that we're
all supposed to be together?

31:07.980 --> 31:10.350
- I...
- We are all together...

31:10.390 --> 31:12.250
in this club.

31:12.290 --> 31:13.690
Sorry, guys.

31:13.720 --> 31:17.120
The chair we got stuck with
was giving me a back ache.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.430
We just went to go find
something more comfortable.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.460
That's it.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.870
Anyway, it's getting late.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.530
Let's get dressed.

31:28.570 --> 31:29.770
Okay.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.990
You enjoyed yourself
last night.

31:50.030 --> 31:52.060
Wasn't that the point?

31:53.860 --> 31:54.860
I guess.

31:55.930 --> 31:57.160
I mean, yeah, it was.

31:58.770 --> 32:00.770
You certainly seemed
to be having a good time.

32:02.340 --> 32:03.670
Oh, I did.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.410
Then what's wrong?

32:08.440 --> 32:09.440
Nothing.

32:12.110 --> 32:13.110
What is it?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.350
It's just that...

32:19.550 --> 32:21.520
Never mind.

32:21.560 --> 32:24.120
Oh, my...
Look, I'm sorry.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.530
Max has a bad back

32:25.560 --> 32:27.320
and I was just looking out
for his condition.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.800
Well, Max's bad back

32:30.830 --> 32:32.700
doesn't stop him
from earning millions.

32:35.070 --> 32:36.940
I didn't mean
to compare the two.

32:36.970 --> 32:38.140
Anyway...

32:43.310 --> 32:44.480
I think we should stop.

32:44.510 --> 32:46.010
Really?

32:46.050 --> 32:47.310
What do you mean "really"?

32:47.350 --> 32:48.610
You're not being fair.

32:49.650 --> 32:51.120
You were in absolute heaven.

32:51.150 --> 32:53.050
You're right.
I was.

32:53.090 --> 32:54.590
But it's off.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.720
Clearly, we can't handle this.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.030
If I don't lose five pounds
by November,

33:08.070 --> 33:09.986
I'm not going to be able to fit
in the Badgley Mischka

33:10.010 --> 33:11.740
that Max got me
for my birthday party.

33:11.770 --> 33:13.370
What are you talking about?

33:13.410 --> 33:15.310
You don't need
to lose one ounce.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.380
Thanks.
That's why I love you.

33:17.410 --> 33:19.050
Oh, that reminds me.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.750
A little gift from me
for no other reason

33:20.780 --> 33:23.380
than everyone deserves a little
surprise every now and then.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.550
Here.

33:26.590 --> 33:27.920
It's yours.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.030
Shoot, you don't like it?

33:35.060 --> 33:36.700
No, I like it.

33:36.730 --> 33:38.830
I mean, I love it.

33:38.870 --> 33:40.530
Good. I'm delighted.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.740
Listen.

33:44.770 --> 33:46.410
I need to talk to you
about something.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.540
I'm listening.

33:47.580 --> 33:51.240
We're calling
the whole open thing off.

33:53.210 --> 33:55.350
Why is that?

33:55.380 --> 33:58.720
It just got too... complicated.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.020
Hm.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.260
Seems pretty simple to me.

34:05.390 --> 34:06.430
What do you mean?

34:06.460 --> 34:08.429
You're afraid.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.100
Afraid of what?

34:10.130 --> 34:11.260
I don't know.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.300
You tell me.

34:13.670 --> 34:15.370
I'm not afraid.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.300
- Yes, you are.
- Of what?

34:18.340 --> 34:19.909
Of breaking out
of your shell,

34:19.940 --> 34:21.570
shaking things up a bit.

34:22.810 --> 34:23.940
I know.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.409
It's not me.

34:27.449 --> 34:29.580
Ron's actually the one
who called it off,

34:29.620 --> 34:31.350
and if one of us
wants to stop,

34:31.389 --> 34:33.550
we both stop,
no questions asked.

34:38.030 --> 34:39.030
He'll come around.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.230
Don't worry.

35:04.850 --> 35:06.020
Oh... Yes!

35:06.050 --> 35:07.090
Oh! Oh, my god!

35:07.120 --> 35:09.660
Oh f... Yes! Yeah!

35:09.690 --> 35:10.860
Oh, great!

35:10.890 --> 35:13.190
Mm.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.330
Hey, babe, what's up?

35:17.370 --> 35:20.970
Hey, so it turns out I'm gonna
be working late-shift tonight,

35:21.000 --> 35:22.940
- covering for Dylan.
- Oh, okay.

35:22.970 --> 35:24.500
Yeah, I'm just here
watching the game.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.170
You want me to
save you some pizza?

35:26.210 --> 35:28.880
No, I'm gonna
be here till midnight.

35:28.910 --> 35:31.610
Uh, yeah, I'll probably
be asleep by then.

35:31.650 --> 35:33.650
No worries,
don't wait up.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.726
Oh, wait, babe! Baby, I got to go!
They're about to score!

35:35.750 --> 35:38.680
Come on! Come on!

35:38.720 --> 35:41.390
Yeah, I love you too.

35:41.420 --> 35:42.420
Bye.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.390
You are a goddess!

35:46.430 --> 35:48.030
- Ugh!
- Glad I can help.

35:48.060 --> 35:49.500
Thank you.

35:49.530 --> 35:51.000
I thank you.

35:52.570 --> 35:53.830
My husband thanks you.

35:56.340 --> 35:58.140
But most of all...

35:58.170 --> 35:59.640
Lady Gaga thanks you.

35:59.670 --> 36:01.870
Yes, because
she just couldn't go on

36:01.910 --> 36:04.080
if you and Gary weren't
there for moral support

36:04.110 --> 36:05.510
from the nosebleed seats.

36:05.550 --> 36:07.510
First mezzanine!

36:07.550 --> 36:08.650
Whatever.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.320
Get out of here
before I change my mind.

36:11.550 --> 36:12.550
Thanks.

37:08.910 --> 37:11.910
"Tonight's password...

37:11.950 --> 37:13.550
Romeo."

37:30.160 --> 37:31.500
Okay.

37:31.530 --> 37:33.170
You're just gonna watch.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.900
There's no harm in watching.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.140
Password.

37:37.170 --> 37:38.940
It's, uh, Romeo.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.780
Welcome back, baby.

38:04.370 --> 38:07.270
And an H-2-0 for Romeo.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.640
- Thanks, Vulnavia.
- Hey, you're welcome.

38:09.670 --> 38:11.140
Can I get you anything else?

38:14.710 --> 38:16.310
Anything?

38:17.510 --> 38:19.880
No, no.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.900
Hi, I'm Angelique.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.200
And you are?

39:16.240 --> 39:18.700
Ron.
Um, I'm Ron.

39:20.110 --> 39:23.680
You are just...
breathtaking.

39:30.790 --> 39:32.550
I... I can't.

39:32.590 --> 39:33.890
You can't what?

39:33.920 --> 39:35.090
I... I can't do this.

39:36.890 --> 39:38.620
Then why are you here?

39:40.160 --> 39:42.190
- My wife, she, uh...
- What about her?

39:42.230 --> 39:43.930
She doesn't know I'm here.

39:46.270 --> 39:49.030
Well, I won't tell her
if you won't.

40:26.110 --> 40:27.110
Sorry.

41:11.750 --> 41:12.890
What's the matter?

41:14.590 --> 41:16.690
Your back?

41:16.720 --> 41:18.220
No, I... I got to
tell you something.

41:19.430 --> 41:20.660
What is it?

41:22.200 --> 41:25.200
Well, I went to the fertility
clinic and I got tested.

41:25.230 --> 41:26.730
Finally.

41:26.770 --> 41:29.200
And?

41:29.240 --> 41:31.870
And I'm the reason
you can't get pregnant.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.010
They said there's
only a 1% chance.

41:41.620 --> 41:42.920
I'm sorry, Ron.

41:44.590 --> 41:45.590
I really am.

41:46.850 --> 41:49.050
But how long
have you known this?

41:50.560 --> 41:52.190
A couple of weeks.

41:53.390 --> 41:55.060
Wait, you've known this
a couple of weeks,

41:55.100 --> 41:56.160
and you didn't tell me?

41:56.200 --> 41:57.530
I'm sorry, I know.

41:57.570 --> 41:59.200
I wanted to tell you.

41:59.230 --> 42:01.400
It just never seemed
like it was the right time.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.040
So every morning
for two weeks,

42:04.070 --> 42:06.610
you silently watched me
take those fertility supplements

42:06.640 --> 42:07.870
as if it was my fault?

42:07.910 --> 42:10.510
I knew you'd be upset.
You know...

42:10.550 --> 42:11.780
Of course I'm upset!

42:13.150 --> 42:14.580
I thought we were
in this together!

42:16.550 --> 42:17.896
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me

42:17.920 --> 42:18.920
something this important.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.970
I'm sorry. I should have told
you as soon as I found out.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.140
Yeah, you should have!

42:38.170 --> 42:39.440
Can you just forgive me?

42:39.470 --> 42:40.710
Give me the keys.

42:40.740 --> 42:42.410
Becca, I'll drive.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.780
I don't want
to be with you right now.

42:44.810 --> 42:47.110
Give me the keys.

42:53.620 --> 42:55.250

44:35.160 --> 44:36.360
Leave a message
after the beep.

45:30.540 --> 45:32.140
We need to talk.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.280
I don't want to talk about it.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.220
I just want to go to bed.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.580
Good morning.

46:08.580 --> 46:09.580
Morning.

46:52.490 --> 46:53.590
Ron...

46:55.800 --> 46:56.960
Yes?

46:58.130 --> 46:59.730
Have you seen
an expensive black car

46:59.770 --> 47:01.010
parked across
the street lately?

47:03.440 --> 47:04.470
No.

47:04.510 --> 47:05.600
I haven't noticed.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.310
It's the second time
I've seen it

47:09.340 --> 47:10.640
ever since
the night at the club.

47:13.180 --> 47:14.480
Oh, babe, you're just...

47:14.520 --> 47:15.850
You're just being paranoid.

47:17.180 --> 47:18.180
I don't know.

47:21.220 --> 47:23.190
This whole thing
has made me feel so...

47:24.490 --> 47:25.590
vulnerable.

47:26.990 --> 47:28.830
You expecting someone?

47:30.230 --> 47:32.500
No, but I...

47:32.530 --> 47:33.600
I'll go see who it is.

47:53.790 --> 47:54.950
Who are those from?

47:58.530 --> 47:59.830
You tell me.

48:03.830 --> 48:07.070
How sweet of Dylan.

48:07.100 --> 48:08.800
Your coworker?

48:08.840 --> 48:11.970
Yeah, he knows I've been under
a lot of stress lately.

48:12.010 --> 48:13.640
Some friend.

48:13.670 --> 48:15.470
He doesn't even know
your favorite flower.

48:15.510 --> 48:18.540
Chrysanthemums are
my favorite flowers.

48:20.550 --> 48:24.050
Hey, why don't you
call in sick today?

48:24.080 --> 48:25.920
We could both
use some quality time

48:25.950 --> 48:28.020
here at the house,
just you and me.

48:28.060 --> 48:31.420
I don't have any sick
days left, remember?

48:31.460 --> 48:33.660
And somebody
has to pay the bills.

48:47.570 --> 48:49.010
Come on.

48:52.450 --> 48:54.010
Come on.

48:54.050 --> 48:55.350
Yes, yes, one more.

48:56.750 --> 48:58.550
Come on!

48:58.590 --> 49:00.290
Good.
Whoa, whoa.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.450
Whoa,
take it easy, Hulk.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.036
What's gotten into you?
You all right?

49:05.060 --> 49:08.530
No, I'm not all right.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.930
I don't appreciate
you sending my wife flowers.

49:10.970 --> 49:13.800
What are you talking about?
I didn't send her flowers.

49:13.830 --> 49:15.570
Come on, man.
It had to be you.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.080
They arrived
at the loft this morning.

49:18.210 --> 49:19.210
Ron...

49:20.840 --> 49:23.240
if I secretly wanted
to send your wife flowers,

49:23.280 --> 49:25.010
why would I send
them to the loft

49:25.050 --> 49:27.280
where you would
obviously see them?

49:29.750 --> 49:31.250
Okay, I'm sorry.

49:31.290 --> 49:32.880
Apology accepted, jerk.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.460
So did Becca say
who they were from?

49:36.490 --> 49:39.560
Her gay friend Dylan that she
works with at the hospital.

49:39.590 --> 49:41.330
And how do you know
it wasn't him?

49:41.360 --> 49:42.760
Because I could tell
she was lying!

49:44.630 --> 49:46.800
At least I think she was.

49:46.830 --> 49:48.170
So who else
could it have been?

49:49.340 --> 49:50.446
Your guess
is as good as mine.

49:50.470 --> 49:52.570
I mean,
she's always working late.

49:52.610 --> 49:54.010
She's never around.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.640
She's always
out of the house.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.180
You're being paranoid.

49:57.210 --> 49:58.856
She's probably just
getting together with Mindy.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.360
I don't know what
to believe any more.

50:01.750 --> 50:02.850
What's gotten into you?

50:06.190 --> 50:07.590
I messed up, Max.

50:09.290 --> 50:10.420
I went to the club alone.

50:11.530 --> 50:12.760
Open for Bizness?

50:12.790 --> 50:15.090
I know it sounds worse
than it is.

50:15.130 --> 50:16.860
Some girl kissed me
at the bar.

50:16.900 --> 50:18.960
I never felt so guilty.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.430
I couldn't bear it,
so I stopped, and I left.

50:22.470 --> 50:25.270
That's all, just kissing?

50:25.310 --> 50:27.170
I swear,
I wouldn't lie to you, Max.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.610
- Does Becca know about this?
- No.

50:32.050 --> 50:33.780
She wouldn't believe
it never went further.

50:33.810 --> 50:35.450
She's already furious at me

50:35.480 --> 50:37.200
for not telling her
about my fertility test.

50:38.590 --> 50:39.850
So you finally
told her, huh?

50:39.890 --> 50:41.820
Yeah, and she blew up at me

50:41.860 --> 50:43.666
for keeping her in the dark
about it for weeks.

50:43.690 --> 50:45.160
Now is not the time

50:45.190 --> 50:47.130
to confess going
to the club on my own.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.060
Our marriage would be over.

50:51.570 --> 50:54.200
Look, I'm sure
she'll forgive you...

50:54.230 --> 50:55.230
eventually.

50:56.340 --> 50:57.570
This whole open marriage thing

50:57.600 --> 50:59.440
was supposed to be
an escape from our problems.

51:00.410 --> 51:01.970
I feel like all it's done
is cause more.

51:03.580 --> 51:06.080
- I hope you don't blame me.
- No, of course not...

51:06.110 --> 51:07.110
Yoo-hoo!

51:08.920 --> 51:10.350
Hey, boys.

51:10.380 --> 51:13.150
You guys are looking
all pumped up and sweaty.

51:13.190 --> 51:14.850
You haven't been to a gym

51:14.890 --> 51:17.020
since you were
forced to in college.

51:17.060 --> 51:18.736
Yeah, since when
did you become a gym bunny?

51:18.760 --> 51:21.160
Since you bought me
a Badgley Mischka

51:21.200 --> 51:22.660
two sizes too small.

51:22.700 --> 51:25.060
But that's not
the only reason I'm here.

51:25.100 --> 51:26.870
Oh, what else?

51:27.900 --> 51:29.230
What can I say?

51:29.270 --> 51:31.000
I miss my boys...

51:31.040 --> 51:33.140
and I really miss
our little get-togethers.

51:33.170 --> 51:38.040
You guys have to admit
that was the hottest sex

51:38.080 --> 51:39.080
ever!

51:39.110 --> 51:40.710
Mindy! What's gotten into you?

51:40.750 --> 51:41.750
Keep it down!

51:43.350 --> 51:44.680
I know when I'm not wanted.

51:47.550 --> 51:48.620
Mindy!

51:48.660 --> 51:50.020
Yes?

51:50.060 --> 51:51.220
Have you seen Becca lately?

51:52.730 --> 51:54.860
Not as much as I would like.

52:26.330 --> 52:28.030
- Hi, you've reached
Becca's cell.

52:28.060 --> 52:30.130
- Leave a message
after the beep.

52:30.160 --> 52:32.400
Hey, babe, I'm just
calling to check in,

52:32.430 --> 52:33.500
see how you're doing.

52:33.530 --> 52:35.100
Don't work too hard.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.170
Love you.

52:47.680 --> 52:50.050
Critical Care,
how may I help you?

52:50.080 --> 52:51.650
Hey, Dylan, it's Ron.

52:51.690 --> 52:53.650
Oh, hi, sexy.

52:53.690 --> 52:54.690
How's it hanging?

52:54.720 --> 52:56.350
Uh, can I speak to Becca?

52:56.390 --> 52:57.720
She's not here.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.890
Well, when will she be back?

52:59.930 --> 53:03.660
She won't.
She's not working this shift.

53:03.700 --> 53:05.730
That's odd, she told me
she was working late.

53:05.770 --> 53:07.730
Nope, you must have
gotten the dates mixed up.

53:07.770 --> 53:09.100
She left three hours ago.

53:10.770 --> 53:13.770
Hey, Dylan, did you send her
flowers this morning?

53:13.810 --> 53:15.670
No.

53:15.710 --> 53:17.380
Why would I send her flowers?

53:18.550 --> 53:19.780
Oh, never mind.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.250
Well, I'd love to chat
the rest of the night away,

53:24.280 --> 53:28.290
but Nurse Ratchet's giving me
the evil eye, so adios, amigo.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.890
Okay, yeah, thanks, bye.

53:44.070 --> 53:46.610
Password.

53:47.740 --> 53:48.740
Boomerang.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.620
Welcome back, mama.

54:13.370 --> 54:15.330
A virgin Harvey Wallbanger

54:15.370 --> 54:16.800
and...

54:16.840 --> 54:18.440
a cherry to prove it.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.710
Thank you.

54:21.740 --> 54:23.310
You're welcome.

54:48.470 --> 54:49.670
I knew you'd come.

54:53.970 --> 54:55.840
I can't stop thinking about you.

54:55.880 --> 54:58.280
I came here
to tell you it's over.

54:59.750 --> 55:01.010
Just because
Ron called it off?

55:01.050 --> 55:03.050
No, because
I'm calling it off.

55:03.080 --> 55:05.120
The four of us
might be off,

55:05.150 --> 55:06.350
but not me and you.

55:06.390 --> 55:08.650
Remember, this...
This was your idea.

55:08.690 --> 55:11.390
This wasn't about
you and me, Max.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.690
We don't have
to do this any more.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.230
I'm pregnant.

55:24.370 --> 55:26.470
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

55:26.510 --> 55:27.910
Yeah, of course.

55:27.940 --> 55:29.910
But now no more.

55:31.350 --> 55:33.310
No more lies,
no more rules.

55:33.350 --> 55:34.510
No more.

55:42.460 --> 55:43.690
You're right.

55:45.390 --> 55:50.030
I mean, I want you,
but... you're right.

55:50.060 --> 55:52.560
I can't do this
to Ron any more.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.500
No, we can't.

55:54.530 --> 55:56.970
Or Mindy.

56:01.240 --> 56:03.740
And please,
don't send any more flowers.

56:03.780 --> 56:05.840
I don't know how
to explain that to Ron.

56:05.880 --> 56:07.250
What are you talking about?

56:07.280 --> 56:08.780
I didn't send you flowers.

56:10.220 --> 56:12.780
If you didn't send them,
then who did?

56:26.330 --> 56:27.730
You're up.

56:27.770 --> 56:29.030
I was worried.

56:30.870 --> 56:31.970
Why were you worried?

56:34.040 --> 56:36.470
I called the hospital
and you weren't there.

56:39.210 --> 56:40.980
Are you spying on me?

56:44.820 --> 56:47.250
Why weren't you at work?

56:47.290 --> 56:49.220
- None of your business.
- I'm your husband.

56:50.620 --> 56:52.920
You lied to me when you said
you were working late,

56:52.960 --> 56:55.090
and the flowers
didn't come from Dylan either.

56:55.130 --> 56:56.930
So, tell me the truth.

56:56.960 --> 56:58.100
What's going on?

56:58.130 --> 56:59.730
Nothing.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.600
You call this nothing?

57:13.110 --> 57:14.510
When were you
gonna tell me?

57:16.520 --> 57:17.780
I just wanted
to wait and see

57:17.820 --> 57:19.350
if there was no complications.

57:21.290 --> 57:22.890
We've been trying for so long

57:22.920 --> 57:24.790
that I didn't want
to get your hopes up.

57:28.860 --> 57:30.700
So you really think
I could be the father?

57:31.970 --> 57:33.360
Of course you're the father!

57:35.340 --> 57:36.430
You beat the odds.

57:37.600 --> 57:39.170
Your 1% chance came through.

57:43.740 --> 57:44.880
But what about Max?

57:44.910 --> 57:46.280
What about Max?

57:46.310 --> 57:48.350
We used protection.
You know that.

57:48.380 --> 57:50.350
That was one of
our golden rules.

57:56.060 --> 57:57.290
So where were you?

57:59.890 --> 58:01.160
Fine.

58:01.190 --> 58:03.190
I just wanted to be alone...

58:03.230 --> 58:05.660
to think.

58:05.700 --> 58:08.570
So, I went to the mall and
I looked at baby merchandise.

58:14.510 --> 58:16.510
And the flowers?

58:16.540 --> 58:19.340
I honestly have no idea.

58:20.980 --> 58:22.480
A secret admirer, I guess?

58:25.220 --> 58:26.550
Hmm, B...

58:39.230 --> 58:40.830
Happy Birthday, Mindy.

58:40.870 --> 58:42.230
You two look like twins.

58:43.770 --> 58:45.340
Oh, do you need a drink?

58:45.370 --> 58:47.740
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, I need a refill.

58:47.770 --> 58:49.640
Ron, darling,
would you do the honors

58:49.680 --> 58:51.680
and escort me to the bar?

59:00.720 --> 59:02.450
You look beautiful tonight.

59:03.760 --> 59:06.690
Yeah, I look exactly
like your wife.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.430
Do you know
she gave me this dress?

59:11.460 --> 59:13.360
Yeah, I know.

59:13.400 --> 59:14.400
She had me buy two.

59:14.430 --> 59:16.700
Guess now I know why.

59:19.310 --> 59:21.070
Listen.

59:21.110 --> 59:23.086
I need to ask you something,
but only if you promise

59:23.110 --> 59:24.810
to keep this between us.

59:24.840 --> 59:27.110
I'm not having sex
with you again, Max,

59:27.150 --> 59:28.480
if that's where this is going.

59:28.520 --> 59:30.980
No, I'm worried
about Mindy, actually.

59:31.020 --> 59:33.620
- Oh.
- Maybe, I'm just being paranoid,

59:33.650 --> 59:36.290
but my gut tells me she's pretty
infatuated with your husband.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.390
She won't stop
talking about him.

59:38.430 --> 59:41.260
News flash, she's always
had a thing for Ron

59:41.290 --> 59:42.630
ever since college.

59:44.100 --> 59:46.000
I know.
I'm not blind,

59:46.030 --> 59:48.630
but it's more...
intense lately,

59:48.670 --> 59:49.970
a lot more.

59:52.010 --> 59:54.940
You mean since she's consummated
her friendship with Ron?

59:54.980 --> 59:56.070
Even before that.

59:56.110 --> 59:57.486
When you suggested
the open marriage,

59:57.510 --> 59:59.440
it wasn't hard
for me to convince Mindy,

59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.610
and I think
she welcomed any excuse

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:03.450
to have sex with your husband!

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.150
Well, she's not having sex
with Ron anymore.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.950
It's over.

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.790
Mindy doesn't give up easily,

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.860
and I have a very
strong suspicion

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.630
that she's scheming a plan
to have her cake and eat it too.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.590
- What's this about cake?
- Hm-hmm.

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.960
I'm famished.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.660
I haven't had a carb
in two months.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.500
I thought you wanted to wait

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.700
until after dinner
to blow out your candles?

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.640
Well, I changed my mind.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.710
It is a woman's prerogative
to change her mind.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:32.480
- Isn't it, Becca?
- Yeah.

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:33.950
Let them eat cake!

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.090
So let me get this straight.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:52.030
You're just assuming
Max is the father?

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.670
There's only a 1%
chance it's Ron's.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.170
You do the math.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.370
One percent
is still one percent.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:01.370
You need to be sure.

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:03.710
We'll get you
a prenatal paternity test.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.940
How can I afford that?

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.210
Insurance won't cover it.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.250
Relax, I know a guy.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.510
That'll do it for free?

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.620
Old boyfriend, he owes me.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:13.920
Only requires
a blood draw from me?

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.220
Right, but you'll also need
a D.N.A. sample of Ron.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.790
How am I gonna do that
without rousing suspicion?

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:21.360
Geez, honey.

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:23.390
You really need to start
watching more crime shows.

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:42.340
Ow.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:49.280
Up before me,
and making breakfast.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.320
Yes, I'm making breakfast.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.720
You know, that's one of the
things I love about you, babe,

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.550
how observant you are.

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.790
What's the occasion?

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:02.390
Does there have
to be an occasion?

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:04.700
Can't it just be
to remind you that I love you

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:07.900
and that you are the most
amazing woman in the world?

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.800
Wow, okay.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.340
Um...

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:13.640
Oh, check this out.

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:15.240
Huh?

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.070
Yeah.

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:18.310
Am I dreaming?

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.380
And guess what?

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:21.310
I have some really great news.

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:23.150
What?

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.980
I got the job.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.750
- What?
- The community center, yeah.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:30.860
- Really?
- Yeah, we're gonna make a fortune.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.990
The mayor's setting up
a press conference.

01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:35.560
My construction business
is going to skyrocket.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.330
This is amazing.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.230
Best of all, you don't
have to do double shifts

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:41.730
at the hospital anymore.

01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:44.270
In fact,
when the baby comes,

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.000
you don't have to do any shifts
at all, if you don't want

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.170
for as long as you want.

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:50.440
This is such good news.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.940
- Yeah.
- Things are finally looking up.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.550
- Yeah, and guess what else?
- There's more?

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.420
We're not gonna flip the loft.

01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:01.050
We're not?

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:02.210
No, we don't need the money.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.120
This place can be ours,
to keep.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.630
A real home, for us.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.400
For our family.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.430
Yeah.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.230
You know...

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:18.700
I really think this whole
open relationship thing,

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.800
even though it's over,

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.210
really did help us
in a roundabout way.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.410
Good.

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.180
Flowers again?

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.910
It better not be.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.240
What the hell is this?

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:55.240
Who knows you're pregnant?

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.580
Nobody.

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:00.110
You haven't told anybody?

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:02.450
No.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.360
This is really creepy.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.860
You know what?

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:22.270
You're right.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.500
Somebody is spying on us.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.790
- The files you're looking for.
- Thank you.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:48.160
So did anything hair-raising
happen last night?

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.960
Mission accomplished.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.330
Nice work, Nancy Drew.

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:54.600
And your blood donation.

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.070
Dracula thanks you.

01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:02.210
And I thank you.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.640
Anything for my B.F.F.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.740
And whatever happens,

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.910
I'm here for you, okay?

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:10.980
- Okay.
- Good.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.950
Now, cover for me.

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.090
I'll run these over to my ex
and be back in a jiff.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.790
Unless he wants to fool around
for old times' sake.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.930
To Ron. No one deserves
this windfall more than you.

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:32.340
- Here, here.
- You've worked so hard for this,

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:33.540
I'm so proud of you.

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:35.110
Thanks, guys.
Now for the hard part:

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.210
Actually getting
this thing constructed

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.280
on time and on budget.

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.010
You'll kill it, pal,
I know you will.

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:57.360
Is this the girl
you were looking at

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.520
the first night at the club?

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.370
Yeah.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:07.070
You care to tell me
how and when this happened?

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.140
I went back to the club.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.650
One time.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.910
Um, Mindy,
maybe you and I

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.220
- should go outside for...
- No!

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.950
You stay right here.

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:23.890
You went back to the club
by yourself?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.160
Yes.

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:28.390
I am so sorry.

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:30.390
Okay? But I didn't do anything.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.560
You didn't do anything?

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.070
No, I mean,
obviously I kissed her,

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.140
- but that's all!
- Kissing is something.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:41.670
I know, you're right.
I'm sorry.

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:44.780
She wanted to do more,
and I stopped.

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:47.140
What do you want?
A medal?

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.580
I'm sorry.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.790
Ron, you were the one
who put a stop

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.120
to this whole open relationship.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.190
I know!

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:00.760
I completely
and totally messed up.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.430
Yes, you did.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.180
Now what?

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:21.850
- I'm fired.
- What?

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.819
The mayor got
the same text that we got.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.520
That's it, I'm out.

01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:29.850
So just like that
we're back in the poor house?

01:08:46.069 --> 01:08:48.740
That's it! I am done!

01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:50.710
I am sick of all the lies!

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.540
Max, do you want
to tell 'em?

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:56.850
Becca, please, be careful
what you're about to say.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.319
Max and I went back to
the club by ourselves

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.649
without you, Mindy,
and without you.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:03.790
How does that feel?

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.560
Is this true, Max?

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.760
Oh, wait,

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.106
and that's not
even the worst part!

01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:13.300
That's enough!

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:15.770
I want you and Ron
out of here now.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.910
I thought we meant
more to each other than this.

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.880
I thought this whole
open relationship

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.279
was gonna bring us
closer together.

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:35.090
But I don't know you anymore!

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.550
Either one of you!

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:27.340
Afternoon, doll.

01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:28.840
How was last night?

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.140
Don't ask.

01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:33.680
Are you okay?

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:41.220
Well, whenever you're ready,
my shoulder's available.

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:42.990
Now this may not
be a good time,

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.690
but the results are in
on your paternity test.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.230
And?

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.330
Well, I didn't peek.
That would spoil the drama.

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.330
And the winner is...

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:56.030
Drum roll, please.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.580
Sorry.

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.280
I just can't right now.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.120
It's okay, sweetie.

01:11:12.150 --> 01:11:13.580
Thank you
for doing that, though.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.920
My pleasure.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.420
All right,
now get out of here.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.920
Your shift's over.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.090
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.680
Mindy?

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:22.820
Ron?

01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:30.990
Anybody here?

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:36.400
Oh, my God, Ron!

01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:45.140
Consider that a warning.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:50.010
So you're the one
with the black car?

01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:51.550
Stalking us?!

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:55.720
Stalking?
I wouldn't call it that.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.790
I think it's more like...

01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.620
keeping in touch.

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:10.230
Stop... right... there!

01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:15.870
Why are you doing this, Mindy?

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.380
Take off your clothes.
Put that on.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.750
We'll look so much alike,

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.080
Ron won't know who's who.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.820
This has gone too far!

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.090
I said put it on.

01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:37.430
You never had it so good.

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.730
Two for one!

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:45.340
Mindy!

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:47.910
What the hell
is going on?

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.170
What took you so long?
I texted you an hour ago.

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:52.440
Honey, I can tell
that you're upset.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.580
I'm not upset.
I'm happy.

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:59.420
Now be a sport
and take your clothes off

01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:00.980
and join us...

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.560
one... last... time.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.130
Mindy...

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.230
Now!

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.030
Just do what she says.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.130
Okay, okay.

01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:17.800
Can't we just talk this
through calmly like adults?

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.070
- You need help.
- I'm not crazy, Max.

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:23.070
Well, you're not in your
right mind, sweetheart.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.240
You've lost the ability
to distinguish

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.710
between right and wrong.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.380
Oh!

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:30.080
Didn't we let all that go,

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.580
that whole right
and wrong thing?

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:36.290
I saw all of you...
in the club sneaking around.

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.590
Wait.

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:41.806
You're the one who put our
pictures on the Caligula app?

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.090
Guilty as charged.

01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:55.440
- Shut up.
- Why would you do that to Ron?!

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:56.940
He lost his job over it!

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:03.180
This thing you've got for Ron
has got to stop right now.

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.280
You think that
all of this is about Ron?

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.620
Yes. Sweetheart,
you're obsessed.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.240
You're damn right
I'm obsessed...

01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:14.360
but not with Ron.

01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:24.200
♪ I'm your secret admirer ♪

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.340
Becca.

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:30.810
Who do you think
sent the flowers?

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:38.350
And the baby carriage...

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:43.620
You and Max
are not very discreet.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.530
Oops.

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.670
Didn't see that coming.

01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:01.370
I'm sorry I hurt you.

01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:02.910
No harm done.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:09.580
I've always wanted
to be just like you...

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:14.520
for us to be best friends...

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.760
for us to look the same...

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:22.230
be the same.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.600
If this is between
you and me,

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.900
let Ron and Max go.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.440
Becca.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.740
You still don't get it, do you?

01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:45.420
Deep down, you love Ron,

01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:47.250
so I love Ron.

01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:48.950
He's a part of you,

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:51.050
so he has to be
a part of me too!

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.760
I was so happy

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:57.890
you wanted
to open your marriage

01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:01.030
so that we...

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:02.470
could share everything,

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.870
so that we could be united,

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:08.810
physically...

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.940
and spiritually.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.120
You know...

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.790
this does remind me

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.620
of all the times
that we shared together.

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:28.590
Those hot times.

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:32.200
It changed me.

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:36.770
It opened me up
to something... deeper.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.470
Yeah.

01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:43.470
They were hot times,
weren't they?

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:45.010
Very.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.310
In fact...

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:51.310
Ron was just talking
the other day about how

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:52.680
he missed those
times we shared.

01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:01.590
Well, then...

01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:03.460
shall we?

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:07.400
I think it would help
if we untied Ron.

01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:09.870
He's taking up all the bed.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.340
Yeah.

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.510
Okay, go ahead.

01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:20.810
Untie him.

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:39.000
Happy now?

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.400
Let the games begin.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.000
Max, lay on the bed
next to Ron.

01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:50.210
And you...

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.680
next to me.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.900
Having fun?

01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:30.010
I love you.

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:31.410
I love you too.

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:14.160
Appreciate it.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.260
What's that?

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:55.970
A paternity test.

01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:21.960
I'm the father.

01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:24.730
I knew it.
