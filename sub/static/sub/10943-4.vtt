Good to see you!

00:05.473 --> 00:07.273
Shhh!

00:07.340 --> 00:08.941
Sorry.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.276
Nevermind.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.645
Nobody ever died
from a lack of sleep.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.446
I should know.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.852
I need my own place,
Amy.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.354
Yeah.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.923
I can't be the guy
in the loft forever.

Brock:
Hey, guys.

Uh, I don't know...

01:24.214 --> 01:26.349
Little clumsy
around the barrels.

Dad's not gonna be happy
with that one.

Here,
I got the whole thing.

01:29.151 --> 01:30.418
Thanks.

So?

01:31.587 --> 01:32.754
How's McClelland doing?

01:32.822 --> 01:34.356
Oh, never better.

01:34.423 --> 01:36.791
Those herbs seemed to cure
the whole stomach issue.

<i>Brock!</i>

01:41.330 --> 01:42.997

That was bloddy terrible.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.867
Yes sir.

01:47.836 --> 01:49.737

be happy.

- You mind taping this one?
- Oh, sure.

Thank you.

01:53.608 --> 01:55.075
(Horse nickers)

01:55.142 --> 01:58.278
You, ah, might wanna take
the lens cap off first.

01:58.346 --> 02:00.413
I'm tired.
You do it.

02:00.481 --> 02:02.314
Another rough night?

02:02.383 --> 02:03.449
Yeah.

02:06.019 --> 02:07.420

Mmmm...

02:07.488 --> 02:09.788
Oh... geez!
(Sighs)

02:09.857 --> 02:10.955
Why don't you
go back to bed,

02:11.024 --> 02:12.492
while the baby's
still asleep.

02:12.559 --> 02:14.326
Lou: Because I gotta get
stuff done around here.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.327
And this is the only chance
I get.

02:16.396 --> 02:18.430
You can't keep getting by
on no sleep like this, honey.

02:18.498 --> 02:19.931
Well, then she has to quit
crying to be fed

02:19.999 --> 02:21.032

02:21.100 --> 02:22.934
And I am so sorry,
Grampa.

02:23.002 --> 02:24.803
I'm fine.

02:24.871 --> 02:27.205
Just pour me a cup
of that coffee.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.173
Thank you.

02:29.241 --> 02:30.642
(Door closes)

02:30.710 --> 02:32.276
You're not ready to go?

02:32.343 --> 02:33.577

02:33.645 --> 02:35.746
To the dentist.
Hello?

02:35.814 --> 02:36.914
My parents left town
this morning.

02:36.981 --> 02:38.081
<i>You promised you'd take me.</i>

02:38.149 --> 02:39.249
Yeah, well I'm...

02:39.317 --> 02:40.584
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

02:41.520 --> 02:43.721
Amy, she has my truck.

02:43.789 --> 02:44.988
Great.

02:45.056 --> 02:46.356
You go ahead,
take my truck, Jack.

02:46.425 --> 02:47.257
I'm not going anywhere.

02:47.325 --> 02:49.158

02:49.226 --> 02:50.560
Gimme a minute.

02:52.362 --> 02:56.198
Mallory: Wow. It's like the ranch
of the living dead over here.

02:56.266 --> 02:57.434
Thanks, Mallory.

02:57.501 --> 02:58.735
Don't worry about it.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.803
My parents went through
the same thing.

02:59.870 --> 03:00.904
I used to keep them up
all night

03:00.971 --> 03:02.672
babbling nonsense
in my sleep.

03:02.740 --> 03:03.972
Jack: Now we just
have to do something

03:04.040 --> 03:06.374
about the daytime babbling.
Come on.

It's been happening
all spring training.

The weird thing is
the problem's getting worse,

04:38.230 --> 04:39.463
not better.

04:39.531 --> 04:40.696
Yeah, well,
they're just re-learning

04:40.764 --> 04:43.066
how to gel as a team.

Better now than

Hey!

their oats?

I promise.

05:03.486 --> 05:04.920
(Laughs)

05:04.987 --> 05:06.588
He just thinks if he's the only
one that feeds the team

05:06.656 --> 05:07.756
they give him a little extra
down the home stretch

05:07.823 --> 05:09.558
when he needs it.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.360
Makes sense.

05:11.428 --> 05:12.760
So back to the barrels.

05:12.827 --> 05:14.929
I think the problem's
our right leader, McSorley.

05:14.996 --> 05:16.864
And what makes you think that?

05:16.932 --> 05:18.299
Well, he's the one
who takes us

05:18.367 --> 05:20.068
into that first turn.

05:20.135 --> 05:21.402
Usually he's got it down,

05:21.470 --> 05:23.171
but these days
he's all over the map.

05:23.238 --> 05:24.939
Well, has he been acting
differently in other ways?

05:25.006 --> 05:26.074
Or...?

05:26.141 --> 05:28.508
Yeah.
Yeah, he has actually.

05:28.576 --> 05:30.610
It's like he's, ah...

05:30.678 --> 05:32.712
Frustrated or something.

05:34.415 --> 05:35.915
You are.

05:35.983 --> 05:37.850
You, uh... you think you
could take a look at him?

05:37.918 --> 05:42.289
Yeah, of course.
I'd need to take him off site.

05:43.224 --> 05:44.190
Is that...

05:44.257 --> 05:46.125
Is that all right?

05:46.193 --> 05:48.194

06:06.245 --> 06:08.313

just dropping you off

06:08.380 --> 06:11.382
maybe you could
invite me in?

06:12.584 --> 06:13.918

06:13.985 --> 06:15.553

if I take a nap?

06:20.825 --> 06:22.158
Yeah, sleep as long
as you like.

06:22.226 --> 06:23.527
I'm just gonna be outside
working on the bike.

06:23.594 --> 06:25.495
Well, it's kinda chilly
in here.

06:30.601 --> 06:31.735

06:54.256 --> 06:55.790

is pink anyways.

Well, her white onesies
are supposed to stay white.

<i>So...</i>

07:37.263 --> 07:39.664
Look, do you want me to do it?
I'll do it.

No, I think I can handle it
there, miss cranky pants.

07:42.702 --> 07:44.836
Actually,
it's Mrs. cranky pants.

07:44.904 --> 07:47.171

make you Mr. cranky pants.

07:52.577 --> 07:54.945
We need to do something
about the sleep issue.

07:55.013 --> 07:56.547
Yeah, you keep saying that,
but we're not.

07:56.615 --> 07:59.750
We just do whatever it takes
to get us to the morning.

07:59.818 --> 08:02.586
Maybe it's time to cut
the nighttime feedings.

08:02.654 --> 08:04.121
She's a little young for that,
don't you think?

08:04.188 --> 08:06.056
I mean, maybe she's just
a growth spurt or something.

08:06.124 --> 08:07.892
No, no, no, no.
It is a comfort thing.

08:07.959 --> 08:10.159
She eats more than enough
in the day now.

08:10.227 --> 08:12.796
I mean, she's using me
as her personal soother.

08:12.863 --> 08:14.731
Ouch. I can see how that
would be painful.

08:14.799 --> 08:16.465
Yeah, tell me about it.
These are my--

08:16.466 --> 08:17.300
No, no, I get it.
I get it.

08:17.367 --> 08:18.501
So, we'll just cut

08:18.569 --> 08:19.803
the nighttime feedings out
then, right?

08:19.870 --> 08:21.370
I mean, I've actually
been reading

08:21.439 --> 08:24.840
a lot about other ways to help
her get back to sleep, so...

08:24.908 --> 08:26.942
You mean like other ways
to reward her

08:27.009 --> 08:28.176

08:28.244 --> 08:30.512
No, I mean like other ways
to sooth her

08:30.580 --> 08:31.980

get back to sleep.

08:32.048 --> 08:33.649

around her finger.

Oh, that's a little
disappointing.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.051
What're you doing here?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.286
I missed the old place.

for a while.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.856

or...?

09:16.923 --> 09:19.459

Yeah, I'm great.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.331
And is Ashley
coming back then?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.633
Naw. We're, ah...
We're on a break.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.570
Relax, guys.
Everything's fine.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.506
More than fine, in fact.

09:35.441 --> 09:37.041
And I'm glad to be home.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.510
Get the rest of my stuff.

09:39.577 --> 09:41.078
Wow.

09:41.146 --> 09:43.014
I didn't expect that.

09:43.081 --> 09:44.448
Man, after everything
they've been through?

09:44.516 --> 09:46.384
To break up now?

09:46.451 --> 09:47.718
What happened?

09:48.653 --> 09:50.921
I should probably go.

09:50.989 --> 09:52.789
Okay.

09:52.857 --> 09:54.257
- Call me.
- I will.

09:58.062 --> 10:00.230
(Hooves beat,
horses nicker)

10:00.297 --> 10:01.931
Reid:
Atta boy!

10:02.566 --> 10:05.168
Mallory: So you're telling me
every time I stay over here,

10:05.236 --> 10:07.270
I have sleep on this lumpy
old couch?

10:07.338 --> 10:08.804
Jack:
I'm sorry, Mallory,

10:08.872 --> 10:11.773
that the accommodations
aren't up to your standards.

10:11.841 --> 10:13.275
Mallory: And what's
with baby the crying?

10:13.343 --> 10:14.809
I mean, Peter and Lou should
do something about that.

10:14.877 --> 10:16.811
Jack: Okay, well, don't
you go sticking your nose

10:16.879 --> 10:18.180
in their baby business.

10:18.248 --> 10:19.581
Mallory:
Fine.

10:19.649 --> 10:21.083
Ear plugs?

10:21.151 --> 10:22.384
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Feel free to take a pair.</i>

10:22.452 --> 10:24.053
None for me, thanks.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.021
Reminds me of getting
a worm stuck in my ear.

10:27.089 --> 10:28.222
What're you talking about?

10:28.290 --> 10:29.657
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>When I was a kid</i>

10:29.724 --> 10:31.259
I took a dare
on a fishing trip;

10:31.326 --> 10:32.726
Ended up in a hospital.

10:32.794 --> 10:34.295
Gross.

10:34.363 --> 10:36.164
Well, you know, I would gladly
stick worms in my ears tonight

10:36.231 --> 10:38.199
if I thought
I'd a better nights sleep.

10:38.267 --> 10:40.334
Just use the earplugs.

10:41.235 --> 10:42.802
Okay.
Sorry everybody.

10:42.870 --> 10:44.538
Um...

10:44.605 --> 10:46.739
We're not gonna let her
keep everybody up tonight.

10:46.807 --> 10:48.108
Peter: Promise.
Jack: She's quiet now.

10:48.176 --> 10:50.877
Maybe this is the night
she sleeps right through.

10:50.945 --> 10:53.480
(Catherine whimpers and wails)

10:56.417 --> 10:57.516
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>So you and Amy?</i>

10:57.584 --> 10:58.984
Just... napping?

11:00.287 --> 11:01.820
Ty:
It's your turn, man.

11:01.888 --> 11:03.456
Come on.
Don't stonewall me on this.

11:03.523 --> 11:06.125
Oh, I'm stonewalling you?

11:06.193 --> 11:08.327
I told you.
It's no big deal.

11:08.395 --> 11:10.529
Campus life just wasn't
for this cowboy.

11:10.597 --> 11:12.098
Big surprise, huh?

11:12.165 --> 11:13.931
That's no reason to split.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.900
It's a break.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.335
Oh, it's a break.

11:17.403 --> 11:18.869
Okay, well...

11:18.937 --> 11:20.371
I mean,
it's not just a break.

11:20.439 --> 11:22.474
We've been fighting
and awful lot lately.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.275
Well, you guys always have.
But it's like you said,

11:24.343 --> 11:26.277
you start fresh
in the morning, right?

11:26.345 --> 11:27.645
Yeah, well...

11:27.713 --> 11:29.413
That whole reset button
thing?

11:29.481 --> 11:32.048
Not really working anymore.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.452
But... things change.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.088
And that is life.
Right?

11:41.058 --> 11:42.759
That bike outside.
That's pretty sweet.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.361
You been hustling pool
again?

11:46.296 --> 11:48.531
It's not mine, man.
I'm just working on it.

11:48.599 --> 11:50.500
Yeah, well good.

11:50.567 --> 11:51.700
I was starting to think

11:51.768 --> 11:55.371
that I wasn't charging you
enough rent.

11:58.875 --> 12:01.543
(Hair dryer whirs,
Catherine wails)

12:04.614 --> 12:07.282
Well, what in God's name...?

12:07.350 --> 12:09.684
Peter: It's the constant
movement and the white noise.

12:09.752 --> 12:13.188
It's calming.
It simulates the womb.

12:13.256 --> 12:15.390
Peter, she's been out
of the womb for months now.

12:15.458 --> 12:18.626
(Hair dryer buzzes,
Catherine cries)

12:18.693 --> 12:20.494
Come on, honey, Lou,
please work with me here.

12:20.562 --> 12:21.795
It, it cut out, okay.

12:21.863 --> 12:24.698
It's not meant to run
for 45 minutes straight.

12:24.766 --> 12:26.500
(Peter mimics static sounds)

12:27.735 --> 12:29.303
Okay, what is that?

12:29.371 --> 12:30.638
It's white noise.

12:30.705 --> 12:32.173
(Catherine wails)

12:33.874 --> 12:35.041
Let me.

12:35.108 --> 12:38.178
Peter,
let me try something.

12:38.245 --> 12:39.745
(Forced exhale)
Okay.

12:39.813 --> 12:42.549
I used to sing Marion
to sleep.

12:43.484 --> 12:47.387
♪ goodnight little darling,
my rodeo queen ♪

12:48.955 --> 12:52.491
♪ the cutest lil' cowgirl

12:54.194 --> 12:56.562
<i>♪ the cows are a-sleeping ♪</i>

12:56.629 --> 12:59.565
♪ it's time for bed
where dreams are... ♪

12:59.632 --> 13:00.932
You gotta be kidding.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.935
(Jack sings as Peter
mimics white noise)

13:07.105 --> 13:09.106
Ty: Well, your eyes don't
look as puffy this morning.

13:09.173 --> 13:10.708
Thank you very much.

13:10.775 --> 13:12.943
No, I...
I mean, you look great.

13:13.011 --> 13:14.177
Okay.

13:14.212 --> 13:15.713
Did Catherine sleep
any better last night?

13:15.780 --> 13:18.082
Not really.
But I' got ear plugs now.

13:18.149 --> 13:20.283
And some eye cream.

13:20.351 --> 13:23.586
And I actually had a
pretty good nap yesterday.

13:23.654 --> 13:26.555
So how are things
with Caleb and Ash?

13:26.657 --> 13:28.057
I don't know.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.325
He's acting like
everything is okay,

13:29.392 --> 13:31.227
but it can't be.

13:31.294 --> 13:32.528
Well..

13:32.562 --> 13:33.930
Maybe they'll be fine.

13:34.031 --> 13:35.564
You know, I mean...

13:35.666 --> 13:38.700
Sometimes a break
makes things better.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.803
(Laughs)

13:46.408 --> 13:47.909
(Tractor rumbles)

14:04.026 --> 14:05.159
(gear clunks)

14:07.228 --> 14:08.996
Dammit!

14:09.064 --> 14:10.463
(Shouts angrily)

14:12.499 --> 14:14.167
You should probably wait
'til you get to the barn

14:14.234 --> 14:15.401
before you dump the hay.

14:15.469 --> 14:18.204
Oh! I went to...
To... hit the...

14:18.272 --> 14:20.273
It was a mistake!
Okay?

14:20.340 --> 14:22.008
I'm just joking.
Don't be such a...

14:22.076 --> 14:23.543
Careful...

14:23.610 --> 14:24.911
A grump.

14:24.979 --> 14:26.311
It's not my fault
you were up all night

14:26.379 --> 14:28.180
doing your song
and dance number.

14:28.247 --> 14:30.749
I've always put in
a full day's work,

14:30.817 --> 14:32.350
even after being up
nights on end

14:32.418 --> 14:33.919
traveling the rodeo circuit.

14:33.987 --> 14:36.855
Yeah, well you're not
in your 30s any more.

14:36.923 --> 14:37.956
You're not even in your-

14:38.024 --> 14:39.758
I know how old I am.

14:40.794 --> 14:42.593
All I'm saying is you
probably shouldn't

14:42.661 --> 14:44.528
be operating heavy machinery

14:44.596 --> 14:46.497
in your current state.

14:51.336 --> 14:53.237
Jack: When you're
right you're right.

14:53.305 --> 14:55.873
No tractor needed.
Great idea.

14:56.909 --> 14:58.308
Jack:
Thanks for understanding.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.343
Understanding?

15:00.411 --> 15:03.580
A man of my advanced age
needs his rest.

15:03.647 --> 15:05.716
So I'll leave you to it.

15:12.090 --> 15:13.190
Open the gate.

15:13.257 --> 15:15.257
Let's get him loaded up.
Quick.

15:15.325 --> 15:17.193
(Truck rumbles on approach)

15:17.260 --> 15:18.327
Reid:
Hey!

15:19.830 --> 15:21.197
What the hell's goin' on here?

15:21.264 --> 15:22.764
It's okay, Dad.
Simmer down.

15:22.832 --> 15:24.166
Where the hell
you taking him?

15:24.234 --> 15:26.235
We think he might be
the problem with the barrels.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.502
He hasn't been himself.

15:27.570 --> 15:28.738
Amy's gonna take a look at him.
That's all.

15:28.805 --> 15:30.739
What, you gonna whisper to him
or something?

15:30.806 --> 15:33.608
- Not exactly.
- That's not your decision to make.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.409
This is my horse.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.544
I just wanted to make sure
he was okay.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.546
He's fine.
I should know.

15:38.614 --> 15:41.482
I've been driving him
for damn near a decade.

15:41.550 --> 15:43.118
Come on, boy.

15:43.185 --> 15:44.753
(McSorley nickers)

15:49.800 --> 15:51.503
<i>Wow... this chuckwagony</i>

15:51.504 --> 15:53.804
sounds like he's really
stubborn.

15:53.873 --> 15:55.039
Ty:
And he's got a temper too.

15:55.107 --> 15:56.674
He really tore a strip
off his son.

15:56.742 --> 15:58.576
Reid's always been like that.

15:58.643 --> 16:00.711
But he's a good man
all said and done.

16:00.779 --> 16:02.413
<i>I spent a lot time</i>
<i>with the Tatum family</i>

16:02.481 --> 16:05.016
back in my rodeo days.

16:05.084 --> 16:08.518
He lost his wife Adele
about a year ago now.

16:08.586 --> 16:10.053
<i>A great woman,</i>

16:10.121 --> 16:12.956
everyone considered her
chuckwagon royalty.

16:13.024 --> 16:14.024
Yeah, I get it.

16:14.092 --> 16:15.225
You know,
I know it would be hard

16:15.293 --> 16:16.860
to retire his favourite horse
right now.

16:16.928 --> 16:18.095
But I just wanna
look at him.

16:18.162 --> 16:20.364
You know,
maybe there's nothing wrong.

16:20.431 --> 16:22.632
But if there is, he could be
risking his whole team.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.500
Well, it's a dangerous
sport to be in, isn't it?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.002
Even with healthy horses.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.303
Well, there's a lot
of opinions about the Chucks,

16:27.371 --> 16:29.505
that's for sure.
But they love their horses

16:29.572 --> 16:31.673
and it's all about family.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.976
They go on the road together
and hop from town to town

16:34.044 --> 16:36.078
for an entire summer.

16:36.146 --> 16:39.648
Everybody has their role,
but the driver is the boss.

16:39.716 --> 16:42.417
And I guess the boss
is allowed to be a jerk,

16:42.484 --> 16:43.518
right, Jack?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.221
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Well...</i>

16:46.289 --> 16:50.225
When he cools down
he'll come around I'm sure.

16:50.293 --> 16:51.526
But he needs his team
to be sound

16:51.593 --> 16:52.760
if he wants to compete.

16:52.828 --> 16:54.062
They don't call it
a half mile of hell

16:54.130 --> 16:55.763
for nothing.

16:55.831 --> 16:57.831
Try living with a baby that
screams its face off all night.

16:57.899 --> 16:59.599
Now that is a half mile
of hell.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.168
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Oh, don't exaggerate now.</i>

17:01.236 --> 17:04.038
I mean, I wouldn't say
she's putting us through hell.

17:04.105 --> 17:06.673
No.
I'm sure you wouldn't.

17:06.741 --> 17:08.142
What do you mean by that?

17:08.209 --> 17:10.877
Excuse me. I'm gonna
get started on the dishes.

17:10.945 --> 17:12.011
What?

17:13.613 --> 17:14.948
(Water sloshes)

17:16.583 --> 17:18.351
Something you wanna
get off your chest?

17:18.419 --> 17:20.819
Yeah,
it's called the baby.

17:20.887 --> 17:22.621
Right.

17:22.689 --> 17:24.223
Okay.
I'm kidding!

17:24.290 --> 17:27.060
But, Peter,
I know you mean well.

17:27.127 --> 17:29.995
But with this sleep issue,
you are too soft.

17:30.063 --> 17:31.496
Oh, so it's my fault?

17:31.564 --> 17:33.465
- Not entirely.
- Just mostly.

17:33.532 --> 17:35.367
Well, every time she cries
you swoop in,

17:35.435 --> 17:36.935
and you bounce her,
and you shush her,

17:37.003 --> 17:40.072
and you do that insane
dance with her.

17:40.139 --> 17:41.539
No wonder she can't
fall asleep on her own.

17:41.607 --> 17:42.574
She never has to.

17:42.641 --> 17:43.908
Okay, you know what?

17:43.976 --> 17:44.708
I don't like to hear
my daughter cry all night?

17:44.776 --> 17:46.577
Neither do I.

17:46.644 --> 17:47.778
Look, there has to be
another way

17:47.846 --> 17:49.313
we can help her to sleep.

17:55.187 --> 17:56.854
Marion? Uh...

17:57.789 --> 18:00.523
Well, she kind of let you
cry it out, I guess.

18:04.228 --> 18:05.395
Really?

18:05.463 --> 18:07.563
Seriously?
She just let them cry?

18:07.631 --> 18:09.932
Yeah.
Yeah, 'til they got to sleep.

18:10.001 --> 18:12.202
It's worth a try.

18:12.269 --> 18:13.703
No.

18:13.770 --> 18:15.938
No, honey, I've read that
that can do permanent

18:16.006 --> 18:17.272
emotional damage to kids.

18:17.340 --> 18:19.408
Do I look emotionally
damaged to you?

That is not
what I'm saying.

<i>I couldn't help overhearing,</i>

18:22.812 --> 18:24.346

It's supposed to work.

18:34.189 --> 18:35.756
No, I'm not interested.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.325
But he's even been
on "The View".

18:37.393 --> 18:38.859
I could go
to the book store...

18:38.927 --> 18:41.962
Mallory! I'm ordering you
to quit butting in.

18:42.864 --> 18:44.232
You're ordering me.

18:44.299 --> 18:46.434
Like you're my drill sergeant
or something?

18:46.502 --> 18:47.902
(Knock at the door)

18:48.836 --> 18:50.303
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Honey, I'm not interested</i>

18:50.371 --> 18:51.704
in what some self-proclaimed
expert has to say about it,

18:51.772 --> 18:53.540
who hawks his book
on talk shows.

18:53.607 --> 18:55.975
Why am I not surprised?

18:56.044 --> 18:57.744
Mallory,
can you get Amy?

18:57.811 --> 19:00.147
Is that an order too?

19:01.215 --> 19:03.183
(Metal squeaks,
hooves clomp)

19:04.151 --> 19:06.519
All right, Dad's at a meeting
with our new sponsors.

19:06.586 --> 19:08.087
We you only got a couple
of hours to check him out.

19:08.155 --> 19:09.955
Okay.
Well, I'll do what I can do.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.759
But, ah, I'm gonna need
some time alone with McSorley.

19:13.826 --> 19:16.295
<i>Jack:</i> <i>You know, Brock,</i>
<i>we've actually met a few times,</i>

19:16.363 --> 19:18.130
you wouldn't remember.
You were pretty young.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.465
(Laughs)

19:19.533 --> 19:21.366
Yeah, Dad had me
on the circuit early.

19:21.434 --> 19:23.368
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Well, when I heard Amy</i>
<i>was working over at your place</i>

19:23.436 --> 19:26.237
I dug out some great
old pictures of your family.

19:26.305 --> 19:27.472
Oh yeah?

19:27.540 --> 19:28.273
You're welcome to come up
to the house;

19:28.340 --> 19:29.574
Have a look if you like.

19:29.641 --> 19:32.077
Yeah, that'd be great.

19:34.046 --> 19:36.513
<i>Brock:</i>
<i>Okay, that's embarrassing.</i>

19:36.581 --> 19:38.315
Don't worry,
Jack's not on Facebook.

19:38.383 --> 19:39.916
Men:
(Laugh warmly)

19:39.984 --> 19:42.052
Brock:
Ah, there's old Buchberger.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.320
<i>Great left wheeler.</i>

19:43.388 --> 19:44.788
Ty:
Buchberger?

19:44.855 --> 19:47.657
How does your dad come up
with these crazy names?

19:47.725 --> 19:48.925
He's a diehard Oilers fan.

19:48.993 --> 19:50.794
Yeah, right here
in Flames country.

19:50.861 --> 19:52.228
I think that's pretty cool.

19:52.296 --> 19:54.730
So like, Gretzky,
Kurri, Coffey?

19:54.798 --> 19:56.865
No, no, no, no.
More like Brackenbury,

19:56.933 --> 19:59.034
Semenko and Laraque.

19:59.103 --> 20:00.636
Dad likes his horses ornery,

20:00.704 --> 20:02.138
so he names 'em
after the tough guys.

20:02.206 --> 20:03.272

20:04.874 --> 20:06.175
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>There's your mom.</i>

20:06.243 --> 20:07.910
<i>She was always great</i>
<i>with the horses.</i>

20:07.978 --> 20:10.112
Yeah,
and even better with Dad.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.517
Ah... that old guy's stubborn
and hardheaded as McSorley.

20:15.585 --> 20:17.885
But she always knew
how to handle him.

20:17.953 --> 20:20.288
I bet he really misses her.

20:21.890 --> 20:23.525
Yeah.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.693
<i>Yeah, it's tough thinking</i>
<i>she'll never get to see me</i>

20:25.761 --> 20:27.762
<i>drive on a wagon.</i>

20:29.431 --> 20:31.165
What's been holding you back?

20:31.233 --> 20:32.900
Dad says I'm not ready.
But the truth is,

20:32.968 --> 20:36.270
he needs me as an outrider
one more year.

20:36.338 --> 20:37.805
He's dedicated the season
to Mom,

20:37.873 --> 20:41.108
so, he wants to win it all
one last time.

20:43.344 --> 20:45.345
So... next year for me.

20:46.547 --> 20:48.214
I hope.

20:49.250 --> 20:50.917

22:18.100 --> 22:20.667
Amy:
Come on, McSorley, come on.

22:20.736 --> 22:21.769
Come on.

22:22.971 --> 22:24.071
Hey.

22:29.111 --> 22:30.778
(McSorley snuffles)

22:36.416 --> 22:37.683
(Hooves clomp)

22:49.729 --> 22:51.129
I know.

22:54.199 --> 22:55.867
Hey, Amy.

22:55.934 --> 22:57.869
So what do you think?

22:57.936 --> 23:00.805
Amy: Well, I had a hunch that
it might be his eyesight.

23:00.873 --> 23:02.940
But he can follow,
he can lead...

23:03.008 --> 23:06.310
As far as I can tell,
he seems just fine.

23:06.378 --> 23:07.778
So what now?

23:07.845 --> 23:09.112
You think it could be
one of the other horses?

23:09.180 --> 23:10.614
I'll think about it.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.048
But I watched that video footage
from the other day

23:12.116 --> 23:14.718
and I was convinced
that it was McSorley.

23:14.786 --> 23:16.219
Well,
maybe my dad's right.

23:16.288 --> 23:19.556
We just need to shake
the rust off in training.

23:19.624 --> 23:20.991
Yeah.

23:21.058 --> 23:21.991
Thanks, Amy.

23:22.058 --> 23:23.459
Amy:
No problem.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.761
(Hooves clomp)

23:27.264 --> 23:28.931
I don't even have
to look at you right now

23:28.999 --> 23:31.534
to know what
you're thinking.

23:31.602 --> 23:32.769
Yeah...

23:32.836 --> 23:36.439
Something still doesn't
seem right to me.

23:39.074 --> 23:40.475
Caleb:
Uh...

23:40.543 --> 23:42.010
I know I told you to help
yourself to anything.

23:42.077 --> 23:44.946
But our sheets?
Come on, man.

23:45.014 --> 23:46.715
Pink's not my colour, man.

23:46.783 --> 23:47.716
I just changed them back
for you.

23:47.784 --> 23:48.917
To the ones you guys left.

23:48.984 --> 23:50.919
Oh. Okay, thanks.

23:52.789 --> 23:53.954
Hey, Ty,
why don't you go ahead

23:54.022 --> 23:56.524
and take the bed tonight.

23:56.591 --> 23:57.758
I'm good on the couch,
man.

23:57.826 --> 23:59.327
No, I'm fine.

24:00.261 --> 24:02.530
I wanna sleep outside
in the mountain air.

24:02.597 --> 24:04.598
Oh.
Are you sure?

24:04.666 --> 24:06.701
Yes, I am.
'Night, buddy.

24:06.768 --> 24:08.602

I put her in the car seat.

24:26.919 --> 24:29.087
Okay, Peter,
just hand her over.

24:29.155 --> 24:30.155
Hand her over.

24:30.223 --> 24:31.357
What?

24:31.424 --> 24:33.091
Okay, Jack...

24:35.061 --> 24:36.729
Lou and Peter:
Shhhh...Shhh...

24:36.796 --> 24:40.131
Jack: ♪ goodnight little

<i>It's good actually.</i>

24:43.635 --> 24:45.770

24:45.838 --> 24:47.472
Whatever it is you have
to say right now,

24:47.539 --> 24:50.074
I am so not in the mood.

24:52.611 --> 24:54.311
(Birds chirp)

24:54.680 --> 24:58.615
Amy: So, this is Reid's team
at a race a few years ago.

24:58.683 --> 25:00.417
<i>Watch how they go around</i>
<i>the first barrel.</i>

25:00.485 --> 25:03.119

<i>Looks good to me.</i>

25:04.088 --> 25:05.989
It's almost perfect.

25:06.056 --> 25:08.557
And now here is the footage
from the other day.

25:08.625 --> 25:11.060
Reid: Watch out! Come on, boy!

25:11.128 --> 25:12.896
It's just like
they've lost all feel

25:12.963 --> 25:14.630
<i>for that barrel.</i>

25:14.698 --> 25:16.399
I don't know,
no matter how I look at it...

25:16.466 --> 25:18.234
You having second thoughts
about McSorley?

25:18.302 --> 25:21.103
No.
No, the horse is fine.

25:21.170 --> 25:23.438
So, I think we should
talk to Brock right away.

25:23.506 --> 25:26.708
'Cause if it's not
the horse...

25:26.776 --> 25:29.044
Could be the driver.

25:33.902 --> 25:36.073
- We need to talk.
- I know, I know.

25:36.142 --> 25:37.675
I shouldn't have stuck my nose
in your baby business.

25:37.743 --> 25:39.376
Jack already gave me
an earful.

25:39.444 --> 25:41.011
- Mallory   - And I know I shouldn't
have mentioned Dr. Mitch.

25:41.078 --> 25:42.445
But come on,
he was on "The View".

25:42.513 --> 25:44.080
- Would you just let me--
- Look, I'm sorry, okay.

25:44.148 --> 25:45.181
I promise you won't hear
another peep out of me.

25:45.249 --> 25:46.482
Mallory!

25:46.550 --> 25:48.618
Just want to ask
one simple question.

25:48.686 --> 25:50.186
Okay.

25:50.254 --> 25:52.789
You went out and bought
that book, didn't you?

25:52.857 --> 25:54.323
I know Peter told me
not to, but...

25:54.391 --> 25:56.659
Mallory.
Just bring me the damn book.

25:56.726 --> 25:57.793
Okay?

26:02.632 --> 26:03.966
Jack:
Caleb O'Dell.

26:04.901 --> 26:07.569
Sorry to hear
about the split.

26:07.637 --> 26:09.337
Wow, news sure does fast
around here.

26:09.405 --> 26:11.807
But it's just a break.

26:11.875 --> 26:14.542
Not a split, you know.
It's a big difference.

26:14.609 --> 26:15.677
Yeah.

26:16.745 --> 26:17.712
Well, I guess you're here
to ask

26:17.780 --> 26:20.748
for your old job back...
again.

26:20.816 --> 26:24.418
Well, I mean,
since you're offering...

26:24.486 --> 26:25.953
The more things change...

26:26.021 --> 26:27.789
Well, ah,
there's one more thing

26:27.856 --> 26:29.089
I wanted to ask you about.

26:29.157 --> 26:30.791
Don't even think about
asking me for a raise.

26:30.858 --> 26:33.393
No, it's the loft.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.528
I was hoping maybe I could
bunk there for a while.

26:35.596 --> 26:37.230
Something wrong
with your trailer?

26:37.298 --> 26:39.199
No I... I rented it to Ty,

26:39.266 --> 26:41.267
and having me as a roommate
wasn't a part of the deal.

26:41.335 --> 26:43.603
So, fair's fair.

26:43.671 --> 26:44.904
Okay.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.706
I'll just take the rent
out of your pay.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.807
Sounds good.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.909
That includes meals though,
right?

26:49.976 --> 26:51.543
Are you done?

26:51.611 --> 26:53.278
(Half laughs)

26:57.017 --> 26:58.150
Dad?

26:58.218 --> 26:59.985
Yeah,
I think it's his eyesight.

27:00.053 --> 27:01.853
It could be
his depth perception.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.188
No, there's no way.

27:03.255 --> 27:03.955
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>No, just hear her out, man.</i>

27:04.023 --> 27:05.223
No!

27:05.290 --> 27:06.624
It would explain why
they're having trouble

27:06.692 --> 27:08.059
around the first barrel.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.360
All he would have to do
is go in

27:09.428 --> 27:10.428
<i>and take a simple eye test.</i>

27:10.495 --> 27:11.830
It's not gonna happen.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.031
Well, what if I'm right?

27:13.099 --> 27:16.067
What if you are?
What if you're not?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.234
Either way he'll never
forgive me

27:17.301 --> 27:19.203
for calling him out.

27:19.270 --> 27:20.670
He's a wagon driver.
It's his whole life.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.339
I'm not taking that away
from him.

27:22.406 --> 27:23.707
Do you want me
to say something?

27:23.775 --> 27:26.243
No I don't.
Don't say anything.

27:28.012 --> 27:30.280
Look,
I appreciate your concern.

27:30.348 --> 27:31.648
I really do.

27:32.416 --> 27:34.751
We just need to make it
through one last season.

27:34.818 --> 27:35.952
(Metal rasps)

27:42.860 --> 27:45.128
Peter: "Sleep.
For crying out loud."

27:45.195 --> 27:46.295
Come on.
Really?

27:46.363 --> 27:47.696
Forget the cheesy title,

27:47.765 --> 27:50.031
it actually lays out
a very simple plan.

27:50.099 --> 27:52.234
When the baby cries someone
goes in and reassures her.

27:52.301 --> 27:53.735
We say something like,
"I love you sweetie,

27:53.803 --> 27:55.503
good night."
Lets her know you're around,

27:55.571 --> 27:57.572
but it's time to sleep.
And you leave the room.

27:57.640 --> 27:58.874
Lou: No cuddling.
Mallory: No dancing.

27:58.941 --> 28:00.408
Lou:
No shushing.

28:00.476 --> 28:01.743
Just let her cry.

28:01.811 --> 28:02.878
For 15 minutes.

28:02.945 --> 28:04.612
Then you go in
and do it again.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.813
You keep doing it,

28:05.881 --> 28:07.782
leaving more time
in between visits.

28:07.849 --> 28:08.949
Until?

28:09.017 --> 28:10.684
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>She falls asleep.</i>

28:10.752 --> 28:12.319
Peter:
Right. 'Course.

28:12.387 --> 28:14.155
How can we trust a doctor who
only goes by his first name?

28:14.222 --> 28:15.389
You agreed to try this.

28:15.456 --> 28:16.857
No I didn't actually.

28:16.925 --> 28:19.293
Well, whatever.
We tried your way.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.327
And now we're gonna try
this way.

28:20.395 --> 28:22.495
So please lose the attitude.

28:22.562 --> 28:23.763
<i>And, Grampa,</i>
<i>you are gonna wanna sleep</i>

28:23.831 --> 28:24.798
out in the loft.

28:24.865 --> 28:26.065
No.

28:26.133 --> 28:28.168
No, you may need me
on song and dance duty.

28:28.235 --> 28:29.669
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Uh-uh.
</i> <i>We're pulling the plug</i>

28:29.736 --> 28:32.172
on the off-key
moonlight serenades.

28:32.239 --> 28:33.606
Off-key?

28:33.674 --> 28:35.641
No one's giving into
the baby tonight.

28:35.709 --> 28:37.075
If you can't take the heat,

28:37.143 --> 28:39.344
get out of the kitchen.

28:40.313 --> 28:41.079
Jack:
(Huffs)

28:41.147 --> 28:42.447
Brock:
Watch it!

28:43.349 --> 28:44.783
Reid:
Come on, boy!

28:44.851 --> 28:46.551
(Barrel clatters)

28:46.619 --> 28:48.987
<i>Jack:</i> <i>So this is where</i>
<i>you're hiding out.</i>

28:49.923 --> 28:51.723
How's it going in there?

28:51.791 --> 28:53.490
Well, Mallory's playing
sleep cop

28:53.558 --> 28:56.227
and she banished me
to the loft for the night.

28:56.295 --> 28:57.962
You might wanna think
of staying up there too.

28:58.030 --> 28:59.630
Sounds like it's gonna be
a rough one.

28:59.698 --> 29:00.998
I don't know,

29:01.066 --> 29:02.366
I think I'll take my chances
with the ear plugs

29:02.434 --> 29:04.802
over that lumpy cot.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.871
Ah, suit yourself.

29:06.939 --> 29:08.639
Hey, Grampa?

29:08.707 --> 29:10.440
Yeah.

29:10.507 --> 29:13.343
I think Reid Tatum's
losing his eyesight.

29:13.410 --> 29:14.510
Oh?

29:15.612 --> 29:17.914
Well,
that could be dangerous.

29:17.982 --> 29:20.951
What should I do?
Should I say something?

29:21.018 --> 29:23.920
Driving that wagon's how
he takes care of his family.

29:23.988 --> 29:27.622
To be told he can't do it
anymore...

29:27.690 --> 29:29.658
Tough to hear that
from an outsider.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.595
I know, but Brock's
not gonna say anything.

29:33.663 --> 29:38.267
Well then, maybe an outsider's
exactly what they need.

29:38.335 --> 29:39.969
Just like our sleep cop?

29:40.036 --> 29:41.435
(Laughs)

29:43.705 --> 29:46.607
Do you think I sing off-key?

29:48.510 --> 29:50.444
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Oh, that is cute.
</i> <i>(Catherine wails)</i>

29:50.512 --> 29:52.213
That bikini looks cool.

29:52.281 --> 29:54.916
Yeah, if you have an extra
10,000 dollars laying around.

29:54.984 --> 29:56.950
There's no way that costs
10,000 dollars.

29:57.018 --> 29:58.518
I'm not talking
about the bikini,

29:58.586 --> 30:00.453
I'm talking about
what's in it.

30:00.521 --> 30:01.922
Lou: Pfft! (Laughs)

30:02.857 --> 30:04.391
Honestly?

30:04.458 --> 30:06.493
You guys having
fun over there?

30:06.560 --> 30:07.827
Lou: Would you rather
we all paced the room?

30:07.896 --> 30:09.496
No, Lou, I...

30:09.563 --> 30:10.898
I can't stand here and listen
to her cry like this.

30:10.965 --> 30:12.565
It's ridiculous.
I'm gonna go in.

30:12.633 --> 30:14.500
Stay strong.
There's only another 20 minutes

30:14.567 --> 30:15.801
<i>until the next visit.</i>

30:15.869 --> 30:17.103
Okay.

30:17.905 --> 30:19.238
I don't like
hearing her upset, okay.

30:19.306 --> 30:20.739
I don't know
what's wrong with that?

30:20.807 --> 30:22.074
There is nothing wrong
with that, okay.

30:22.142 --> 30:23.742
<i>I feel the same way.</i>

30:23.810 --> 30:28.314
Okay, I didn't wanna do this,
but you've left me no choice.

30:28.382 --> 30:29.580
Jack:
(Moans groggily)

30:29.648 --> 30:31.116
Hey.
Sorry, Jack.

30:32.484 --> 30:34.886
The sleep cop
kick you out too?

30:35.954 --> 30:37.021
Yeah.

30:37.689 --> 30:40.725
<i>I'm gonna be bunking with you.</i>
<i>I hope that's okay?</i>

30:40.793 --> 30:42.627
Jack:
For what it's worth,

30:43.562 --> 30:46.830
I wish I never brought up
that whole cry it out thing

30:46.898 --> 30:48.565
the other day.

30:48.633 --> 30:50.667
Lou kinda put me
on the spot and...

30:50.735 --> 30:53.337
Don't worry about that,
Jack, it's...

30:53.405 --> 30:55.239
It's not your fault.
It's a whole other...

30:55.307 --> 30:57.574
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Well, truth be told,</i>

30:57.642 --> 30:59.276
it always tore me apart

30:59.344 --> 31:02.412
to hear Lou and Amy
wailing away,

31:03.347 --> 31:05.114
which they did.

31:06.016 --> 31:08.351
There's no right and wrong
when you're parenting, Peter.

31:08.419 --> 31:11.053
You just gotta do
what's in your gut.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.387
Well, I'll tell you the truth,

31:12.456 --> 31:13.956
I'm feeling a little sick
to mine right now.

31:14.023 --> 31:15.524
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Well, you get some rest.</i>

31:15.592 --> 31:16.692
That daughter of yours

31:16.760 --> 31:18.928
is more resilient
than you think.

31:20.196 --> 31:23.866
She's a Fleming-Morris-
Bartlett after all.

31:23.934 --> 31:25.333
Thanks, Jack.

31:26.569 --> 31:29.471
But you know she's a Bartlett
Fleming-Morris.

31:29.538 --> 31:30.638
Just...

31:36.712 --> 31:38.179
Jack:
(Groans)

31:38.246 --> 31:39.514
Caleb:
What're you guys doing?

31:39.582 --> 31:41.247
Caleb, it is two o'clock
in the morning.

31:41.315 --> 31:42.549
Ah, couldn't sleep,

31:42.617 --> 31:46.086
so I thought I may as well
move in tonight.

31:46.153 --> 31:49.155
Jack: Just promise
me you don't snore.

31:50.091 --> 31:52.993
Sure. I can tell you that
if that's what you wanna hear.

31:53.060 --> 31:56.529
I can also tell you
I don't grind my teeth.

31:56.597 --> 31:58.263
(Catherine wailing)

32:04.671 --> 32:05.872
Okay.

32:05.939 --> 32:07.640
That is enough.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.942
Even with the ear plugs
this is torture.

32:10.010 --> 32:12.077
Dr. Mitch said
for the first couple of nights

32:12.145 --> 32:14.546
it's normal for there to be
long stretches of crying.

32:14.614 --> 32:15.747
Amy: And are you
okay with that, Lou?

32:15.815 --> 32:17.215
This is your baby,
not Dr. Mitch's.

32:17.282 --> 32:18.950
Lou: I don't know! Okay?

32:19.018 --> 32:20.952
I'm starting to think
maybe Peter's right.

32:21.020 --> 32:22.487
Maybe this could leave
emotional scars.

32:22.555 --> 32:24.856
You know, she could develop
some kind of complex.

32:24.924 --> 32:26.858
You know, grow up doubting
her parents' love.

32:26.926 --> 32:28.926
Fall in with the wrong crowd,
drop out of school,

32:28.994 --> 32:30.093
end up with a criminal record.

32:30.161 --> 32:31.361
Lou!
It's time to go back in.

32:31.429 --> 32:32.563
Do you want me to do it?

32:32.631 --> 32:34.431
(Takes a calming breath)

32:34.499 --> 32:36.066
No. I can do this.

32:37.736 --> 32:40.203
She has to learn
how to sleep on her own.

32:45.576 --> 32:47.844
(Loud snoring
from within loft)

32:52.182 --> 32:53.249
(Snoring)

33:01.382 --> 33:03.149
Good morning boy.

33:03.373 --> 33:04.939
Hey, I got something for ya.

33:05.007 --> 33:06.107
Here you go.

33:06.176 --> 33:07.676
Yeah, that's good,
isn't it?

33:07.743 --> 33:09.144
Yeah, yeah.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.247
Yeah, you know who takes
care of you, don't you?

33:14.015 --> 33:15.249
Now listen,

33:16.084 --> 33:18.986
season starts
in a couple of weeks,

33:19.054 --> 33:22.856
and I need you to get us
around that first barrel.

33:22.924 --> 33:23.991
I do.

33:33.033 --> 33:34.434
<i>(Half laughs)</i>

33:34.502 --> 33:37.070
Looks like you
caught me out.

33:37.137 --> 33:40.840
I guess I do a bit
of whisperin' myself.

33:40.908 --> 33:44.578
Well, a horse and driver
share a very special bond.

33:44.645 --> 33:46.178
That is true.

33:46.246 --> 33:50.048
I think he knows you
just as well as you know him.

33:50.116 --> 33:53.752
And I think McSorley
can sense there's a problem.

33:55.255 --> 33:57.690
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:57.757 --> 33:59.592
I think you do.

34:01.027 --> 34:02.293
It's your eyesight,
isn't it?

34:02.361 --> 34:03.494
(McSorley nickers)

34:03.562 --> 34:05.263
Hear that, McSorley?

34:05.331 --> 34:08.899
First she thinks it's you,
now it's me.

34:08.967 --> 34:12.803
Look, Amy, I understand
you're pretty good with horses.

34:12.871 --> 34:15.406
Why don't you stick
with what you know.

34:15.474 --> 34:16.708
I know I'm not a doctor.

34:16.775 --> 34:18.542
All I'm saying
is that you should see one.

34:18.610 --> 34:20.444
My eyes are as good
as they need to be.

34:20.511 --> 34:24.214
Even if it means risking
the lives of your horses?

34:26.583 --> 34:28.418
That is one hell
of an accusation to make,

34:28.485 --> 34:29.819
young lady.

34:29.887 --> 34:31.521
I'm sorry.

34:31.589 --> 34:33.322
Just...

34:33.389 --> 34:35.157
This isn't easy for me.

34:35.225 --> 34:36.859
But that accident
the other day?

34:36.926 --> 34:38.327
That could've been
much worse.

34:38.395 --> 34:40.195
Well, it wasn't now,
was it?

34:40.264 --> 34:41.797
All I can think about
is how many times

34:41.864 --> 34:44.367
you've gotta get those horses
around the barrels this season.

34:44.434 --> 34:47.202
And we'll get around 'em
just fine.

34:57.146 --> 34:58.380
So?

34:58.447 --> 35:00.582
What time did she finally
get to sleep at?

35:00.650 --> 35:02.216
I don't know exactly.

35:03.152 --> 35:04.218
Maybe four?

35:05.754 --> 35:07.488
Four in the morning?

35:07.555 --> 35:10.090
Lou, she cried until
four in the morning straight?

35:10.158 --> 35:11.492
We kept going in
to see her.

35:11.559 --> 35:13.294
Dr. Mitch says crying
can't hurt the baby,

35:13.361 --> 35:15.396
so, there really
is no limit.

35:15.463 --> 35:16.963
(Exhales forcefully)

35:17.031 --> 35:18.499
Yeah, there is a limit.
And we've just reached it.

35:18.566 --> 35:19.833
We're done with Dr. Mitch.

35:19.901 --> 35:21.034
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>I know how you feel, okay.</i>

35:21.102 --> 35:22.802
Listening to her cry
last night made me sick.

35:22.869 --> 35:24.604
But she did eventually
fall asleep.

35:24.672 --> 35:25.805
Yeah, probably from pure
exhaustion, Lou.

35:25.872 --> 35:27.173
I don't wanna quit

35:27.240 --> 35:28.374
after going through
the worst night of my life.

35:28.442 --> 35:30.410
Okay?
It's supposed to get better.

35:30.477 --> 35:33.546
Please, Peter,
just one more night.

35:35.316 --> 35:37.616
Okay. One more night.
But...

35:37.684 --> 35:39.685
I'm staying in the house
this time.

35:39.752 --> 35:41.553
You sure you can handle it?

35:41.621 --> 35:43.188
(Derisive chuckle)

35:45.991 --> 35:48.126
(Horses nicker and grunt)

35:58.337 --> 35:59.704
H'yah!

36:00.639 --> 36:03.207
<i>H'yah! Yah!</i>
<i>(Clicks tongue)</i>

36:03.274 --> 36:04.375
H'yah!

36:05.310 --> 36:08.078
Get over there, McSorley!
Get over!

36:08.146 --> 36:09.279
Come on!

36:09.347 --> 36:10.847
(Wagon rattles)

36:10.914 --> 36:12.649
Dad!
Dad, look out!

36:12.717 --> 36:15.618
(Horse whinnies)
Brock: Whoa! Ahh!

36:17.087 --> 36:18.488
Brock, are you all right?

36:18.556 --> 36:20.390
Reid: (Shouting,
urging horses forward)

36:20.458 --> 36:21.591
My damn foot.

36:23.126 --> 36:26.161
(Thunderous hoofbeats,
wagon rattles)

36:26.229 --> 36:27.796
<i>Reid:</i>
<i>Whoa!</i>

36:27.864 --> 36:28.930
<i>Whoa!</i>

36:30.567 --> 36:31.567
Hup! There!

36:45.513 --> 36:47.782
Ty: Hey, man.
Caleb: Hey. Uh...

36:47.849 --> 36:50.350
Just came by
to pick up a few things.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.319
Oh yeah.
Hey, thanks again

36:52.387 --> 36:53.453
for letting me
stay in this trailer.

36:53.521 --> 36:54.454
I really appreciate, man.

36:54.522 --> 36:56.323
That was the deal.

36:56.391 --> 36:58.958
Besides Heartland
is a pretty good place

36:59.026 --> 37:01.394
for me to be right now.

37:01.461 --> 37:03.529
After seeing what Peter
and Lou are going through?

37:03.597 --> 37:06.499
I'm started to think that
maybe I dodged a bullet.

37:07.434 --> 37:08.367
Well, you are getting
back together

37:08.435 --> 37:10.303
with Ashley though,
right?

37:13.373 --> 37:15.174
Well, you are though,
right?

37:15.241 --> 37:16.709
I don't know.

37:17.643 --> 37:19.678
I miss her though.

37:20.680 --> 37:21.879
You can still make it work,
man.

37:21.947 --> 37:24.648
That's what the break's for,
right?

37:24.717 --> 37:26.951
Yeah well, sometimes
when things break,

37:27.019 --> 37:30.054
they don't always fix up
so well.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.255
Anyway.

37:39.263 --> 37:40.597
You need a hand?

37:40.664 --> 37:42.132
No, I can manage.

37:43.935 --> 37:49.005
You know, Brock, that could've
been a lot worse today?

37:51.408 --> 37:53.476
I'm gonna talk to him.

37:53.544 --> 37:54.744
He's not gonna like
what I have to say.

37:54.811 --> 37:55.911
But I'm gonna talk to him,

37:55.979 --> 37:57.947
before someone gets killed
out there.

37:58.014 --> 38:00.082
All right.

38:00.150 --> 38:01.617
Get better.

38:10.860 --> 38:12.326
(Catherine wails)

38:18.700 --> 38:19.934
Okay.

38:20.002 --> 38:21.335
I got it.

38:22.337 --> 38:23.471
(Wailing)

38:26.307 --> 38:27.440
You okay?

38:27.508 --> 38:29.576
I am so sorry
I pushed you into this.

38:29.644 --> 38:31.779
- What?
- I am a terrible mom.

38:31.846 --> 38:33.180
No. Stop.

38:33.248 --> 38:35.048
No, I can't believe
I sided with this guy

38:35.116 --> 38:36.984
over our own daughter.

38:37.051 --> 38:39.719
You know what?
I hate Dr. Mitch.

38:39.788 --> 38:41.255
I hate this stupid book

38:41.322 --> 38:43.122
and I hate his sleep
training method.

38:43.190 --> 38:46.392
- Lou, easy.
- I'm sorry, I pushed you into this.

38:46.459 --> 38:47.693
I wanna go in and see her.

38:47.761 --> 38:49.128
I just wanna
rock her to sleep.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.597
You know, and let her know
that I love her.

38:51.665 --> 38:52.899
I'm such a bad mom.

38:52.966 --> 38:55.001
No you're not.

38:55.068 --> 38:56.836
No you're not.

38:56.904 --> 38:58.103
Hey?

38:58.171 --> 38:59.437
Listen.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.072
Hey? Listen.

39:04.277 --> 39:05.443
Has she really stopped?

39:05.511 --> 39:07.212
All on her own.

39:08.147 --> 39:09.347
Does this mean?

39:09.415 --> 39:10.882
Peter: No?
Lou: It worked?

39:10.950 --> 39:12.350
Peter: Really? That's amazing!

39:12.418 --> 39:13.484
Shhh!

39:13.552 --> 39:14.618
Sorry.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.086
Come here.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.825
Mallory:
What happened to the book?

39:21.759 --> 39:23.493
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

39:23.561 --> 39:24.795
(Laughs)

39:29.128 --> 39:30.929
Ranch hand:
'Morning.

39:32.831 --> 39:34.398
Reid:
You're late.

39:37.936 --> 39:40.905
I want you feed the team
this morning.

39:40.972 --> 39:42.840
Yeah, you heard me,

39:42.908 --> 39:47.110
they need time to digest
before practice.

39:47.178 --> 39:48.244
You mean...

39:49.146 --> 39:51.915
Yeah, you know damn well
what I mean.

39:51.982 --> 39:54.617
And a couple of broken bones
never kept a Tatum down.

39:54.685 --> 39:56.853
Hell, I won at Ponoka
with cracked ribs?

39:56.921 --> 39:58.254
And at Grand Prairie
with a busted up knee.

39:58.322 --> 39:59.989
You remember.

40:03.993 --> 40:05.761
And, ah, Brock?

40:06.729 --> 40:09.631
I never ever thought that...

40:11.668 --> 40:12.634
It's okay, Dad.

40:12.702 --> 40:15.103
No. No, it's not okay.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.341
Your mom would've
kicked my butt for this one.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.043
And, uh...

40:24.012 --> 40:25.412
I'm sorry.

40:30.986 --> 40:32.720
Now, will you go feed
the damn horses.

40:32.788 --> 40:33.855
Yes, sir.

40:35.357 --> 40:37.156
(Chuckles to himself)

40:40.094 --> 40:41.260
Hey, sweetie?

40:41.328 --> 40:44.063
(Gasps)
Such a good little girl.

40:44.131 --> 40:46.566
Weren't you a good girl
last night?

40:46.634 --> 40:49.102
Such a good sleeper now.
Aren't you?

40:49.169 --> 40:51.270
(Gasps)
Aren't you a good sleeper?

40:51.338 --> 40:52.638
Peter:
Hey.

40:52.706 --> 40:54.139
Lou:
Hey.

40:54.207 --> 40:55.508
Peter: Thought I'd put
it back together,

40:55.575 --> 40:57.075
in case we have a second one
with sleep issues.

40:57.143 --> 40:58.143
Lou: You know you're talking
about climbing Everest

40:58.211 --> 40:59.912
after running a marathon,
right?

41:01.014 --> 41:02.715
Look how happy she is.

41:02.782 --> 41:05.851
It's amazing what
one night's sleep can do.

41:05.919 --> 41:07.886
Peter: Yeah, you did good, princess.
Didn't you?

41:07.953 --> 41:09.954
You did so good.

41:10.022 --> 41:11.623
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

41:11.690 --> 41:12.757
I love you.

41:14.126 --> 41:15.226
(Catherine coos)

41:15.293 --> 41:16.360
Lou:
Oh yes.

41:18.096 --> 41:19.497
(Catherine coos)

41:21.166 --> 41:23.267
Jack:
How would you like a muffin?

41:23.335 --> 41:24.868
Mallory: Is that your way
of saying thank you?

41:24.936 --> 41:26.202
Thank you?
For what?

41:26.270 --> 41:27.938
Two nights of solid sleep.

41:28.006 --> 41:29.640
Oh, ya think?

41:29.707 --> 41:31.542
Caleb snores,
he grinds his teeth,

41:31.609 --> 41:33.443
he's worse than the baby.

41:33.511 --> 41:36.246
I'm sure Dr. Mitch
has a remedy for that too.

41:36.313 --> 41:38.949
Leave Caleb alone.

41:39.017 --> 41:41.851
You nearly drove Lou
and Peter off the edge.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.352
I was just trying
to help them.

41:43.420 --> 41:44.654
And you of course.

41:44.721 --> 41:47.590
Oh.
I appreciate your concern.

41:47.658 --> 41:49.458
More like
self preservation.

41:49.526 --> 41:51.460
You're a total pain
in the butt

41:51.528 --> 41:54.396
when you don't
get enough sleep.

41:55.331 --> 41:56.565
(Laughs)

42:14.515 --> 42:16.083
(Ring case clanks)

42:56.623 --> 42:58.757
(Horse nicker and whinny)

43:00.523 --> 43:01.957
Look.

43:07.766 --> 43:08.799
