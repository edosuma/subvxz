00:25.058 --> 00:27.960
Over here, hon.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.745
- What's wrong, baby?
- Shh, hold on.

01:59.018 --> 02:00.419
Stacey's down.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.678
Target's loose.
West alley. West alley.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.719
On your knees.
On the ground.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.254
Hands behind your head.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.127
Who are you?

03:15.129 --> 03:19.865
Interpol? CIA? Mossad?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.934
None of the above.
Target acquired.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.569
<i>Do you have the package?</i>

03:23.571 --> 03:24.836
Affirmative.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.272
Dispose of the target.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.410
No! Please.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.246
I have information.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.114
We have what we need.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.716
It's not on there.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.652
What I know, no one knows.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.222
It's a thousand times more valuable

03:43.224 --> 03:45.257
than anything on that drive.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.926
Please. Have mercy.

03:51.998 --> 03:54.333
<i>You were supposed to kill this guy.</i>

03:54.335 --> 03:56.034
What part of that wasn't clear?
You were clear.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.603
It's just that...
It's just what?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.438
Your guys went soft?
Or is it just the one guy?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.940
The new guy, what's his name?
Mercy Callo. Is that a name?

04:01.942 --> 04:04.343
It's a crutch.
He's the one who caught the guy.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.545
Yeah. And then
he didn't follow orders.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.180
We're slipping, John.

04:08.182 --> 04:11.383
Stacey's dead, and now we got this.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.319
I know it's your ass in the
world, but it's my ass in D.C.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.855
And in case you haven't noticed,
it's not going well.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.925
He got us information.
Valuable information.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.760
I'll be the judge of that.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.995
Now, in 30 seconds or less,

04:56.997 --> 04:58.830
tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.735
Colonel, if this intel is right,
and he is who we think he is,

05:03.737 --> 05:05.270
this is a game changer.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.172
If we could get him and flip him,

05:07.174 --> 05:09.141
it would set the terror business
back decades.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.943
Not to go after him, not to try,

05:11.945 --> 05:14.579
not an option.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.981
Colonel?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.684
<i>I agree.</i>
As do I.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.019
Kyle, can your team be ready
in 48 hours?

05:22.722 --> 05:24.222
Yes, sir.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.158
Colonel Harding
will lead this operation.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.826
Kyle, you'll be support.
Excuse me?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.161
Thank you, colonel.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.762
<i>All right.</i>

05:32.031 --> 05:33.732
This is black ops, not military.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.001
Colonel Harding is black ops.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.670
Yeah, a lifetime ago.
It's not the same out there now.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.505
This came from on high, Kyle.
My hands are tied.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.874
These are my people.
We got this intel.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.277
I know you did.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.126
Kid, I'm sorry.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.396
Mercy!

06:04.398 --> 06:06.965
Yes, sir?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.333
What happened out there?

06:08.335 --> 06:10.402
He just started talking, sir.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.838
They're all gonna talk.
You can't question orders.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.639
I know.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.508
Look, you weren't everybody's
first choice, Callo.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.909
You were mine.
You got it?

06:19.712 --> 06:22.514
All right. New assignment came
in. We head out in the morning.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.649
Captain.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.184
This assignment
have something to do

06:26.186 --> 06:27.886
with the guy's information?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.288
Doesn't mean you were right.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.598
Approximately 24 hours ago,

06:39.600 --> 06:42.667
we received information
that a high value target

06:42.669 --> 06:45.103
had been captured
and was being held

06:45.105 --> 06:47.806
inside a Chechen prison.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.108
But the Chechens are denying it.

06:50.110 --> 06:54.346
The target's name
is Rudolph Martin.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.319
Can I help you?

07:01.321 --> 07:02.921
Yes.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.891
Agent Black,
I asked her to be here.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.660
Natalie, grab a chair and join us.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.495
Of course, sir.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.879
So why are the Chechens
denying they have him?

07:27.881 --> 07:31.650
Because they want him
for themselves.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.585
Why?

07:33.587 --> 07:36.555
During the second Chechen War,

07:36.557 --> 07:39.391
Martin was hired by Shamil Baseyev,

07:39.393 --> 07:42.727
the militant separatist leader,
to conduct a series of attacks

07:42.729 --> 07:44.830
on civilian targets inside Moscow.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.965
Martin took their money
but reneged,

07:46.967 --> 07:49.034
never going through with
the attacks. He conned them,

07:49.036 --> 07:50.735
he humiliated them
and stole their money,

07:50.737 --> 07:52.637
and, as a result,
they lost the war.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.040
Many of the old hard-liners

07:55.042 --> 07:57.175
blame Martin for the tide turning.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.845
He is their
public enemy number one.

08:01.614 --> 08:05.083
Our mission is to
infiltrate the prison,

08:05.085 --> 08:07.152
extract Martin, alive,

08:07.154 --> 08:09.387
and bring him back
to the United States.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.690
Any questions?

08:14.260 --> 08:16.394
All right, you're dismissed.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.000
Let me just have a word with her.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.935
You know how to make an entrance.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.872
Too much?
Maybe for some. CIA?

08:26.874 --> 08:30.242
Oh, I'm something like that.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.280
<i>What's Insight?</i>

08:35.282 --> 08:36.948
It's a global intelligence company.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.183
Basically the CIA for businesses.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.386
What's she doing here?

08:42.389 --> 08:44.422
I have no idea.

08:50.396 --> 08:53.131
I could tell by the way those
soldiers were staring at me,

08:53.133 --> 08:56.034
they haven't a clue
as to why I'm here.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.803
They were staring at you because
you're an attractive woman

08:58.805 --> 09:02.207
and they've been running
around the desert for months.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.876
You're here because
I ordered you to be here.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.380
You know Rudolph Martin.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.315
No one knows Rudolph Martin.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.051
Then why did England,
Germany, Israel,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.987
Spain and the United Nations
ask you to advise

09:15.989 --> 09:19.424
their counter-terrorism
division regarding Martin?

09:22.962 --> 09:24.429
How did you know about that?

09:24.431 --> 09:27.432
Well, these medals
aren't just for show.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.036
Yes, I've studied Martin,

09:31.038 --> 09:33.004
but if anyone says
they truly know him,

09:33.006 --> 09:34.806
they're full of shit.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.609
Every sentence regarding Martin
should come with a disclaimer.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.545
In your expert opinion,

09:40.547 --> 09:43.915
what are the Chechens
going to do to Martin?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.851
It's been a long time

09:46.853 --> 09:50.755
since my own country sought
my counsel, Colonel Harding.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.757
Well, the slate is clean here.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.092
Is it?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.860
With me it is.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.800
Well...

10:01.802 --> 10:05.437
I think the Chechens are
going to give him a trial,

10:05.439 --> 10:08.273
something public, and then
they're gonna execute him.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.075
Probably within the same hour.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.177
I agree.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.912
But he's too valuable to kill.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.880
Which is why you're here.

10:15.882 --> 10:20.452
Natalie, your father
was my best friend

10:20.454 --> 10:22.921
and the finest soldier
I ever served beside.

10:22.923 --> 10:26.024
Why is that relevant?

10:26.026 --> 10:28.259
It's relevant to me.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.095
You are in a unique position.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.364
You not only know the enemy,

10:32.366 --> 10:35.100
you have my faith
and trust as well.

10:37.436 --> 10:38.870
What do you need me to do?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.439
Once we get that
son of a bitch back here,

10:41.441 --> 10:45.377
you'll verify his identity
and lead the interrogation.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.779
You'll break him.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.148
Until then, educate the team.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.817
Make sure they know
who they're going to get.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.619
What is this?

10:54.621 --> 10:57.656
It's good to know
who you're talking to.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.935
Martin ascended to
the top of the FBI's

11:10.937 --> 11:14.172
and Interpol's Most Wanted list
a decade ago.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.242
He has no birth certificate,
no passport,

11:17.244 --> 11:20.445
and claims residency
in no particular country.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.480
Rudolph Martin is the man
behind the man.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.183
He puts people together,
he moves money,

11:25.185 --> 11:27.686
and provides intel
on possible targets.

11:27.688 --> 11:31.523
He's not the face of terrorism,
he's the brain.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.091
<i>The prison is located</i>

11:33.093 --> 11:35.827
at the base of
the Caucasus Mountains.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.697
This totally isolated
maximum security facility

11:38.699 --> 11:40.899
is nicknamed Inferno.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.601
The prison is built down, not up,

11:43.603 --> 11:45.236
and there are eight levels.

11:45.238 --> 11:48.406
So you won't find any signs.
No prison yard.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.576
Once you're in, you don't come out.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.712
Your initial point of entry
is a boiler room.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.414
This gives you access
to the northern stairway.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.550
From there, it's a straight shot
to solitary.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.719
We want you in and out of there
in three hours.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.821
The first four are
administrative offices,

12:02.823 --> 12:04.656
lockers and so on.

12:04.658 --> 12:07.492
Then there are three levels
of general population.

12:07.494 --> 12:11.496
There are approximately 60 to 70
prisoners in this area.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.132
And then finally, the eighth level,

12:14.134 --> 12:16.101
is solitary confinement.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.604
Martin is likely here,
although we can't confirm this.

12:26.345 --> 12:28.046
Percy Kendall.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.483
<i>This is the only known photograph</i>

12:31.485 --> 12:32.951
ever taken of Martin.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.986
It was taken in South Africa
five years ago.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.755
It's never been authenticated.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.324
He is hyper intelligent
and extremely paranoid.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.826
He puts out false information
about his whereabouts,

12:41.828 --> 12:44.295
he fakes leads, he employs doubles.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.598
That might not even be him.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.567
You gentlemen will be the first
to know that for certain.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.671
The guards, approximately 40,

12:53.673 --> 12:56.741
live in fear of their warden,
Ivan Rudovsky.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.244
Born and raised in Lebanon,
but of Chechen descent,

12:59.246 --> 13:01.513
he's a former SAS officer

13:01.515 --> 13:03.715
charged with the murder of a POW.

13:03.717 --> 13:06.384
Before sentencing,
he fled Chechnya,

13:06.386 --> 13:09.454
and now oversees
all Inferno's operations.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.023
Once the package is secured,
you're gonna proceed

13:12.025 --> 13:14.125
a half klick east
to the extraction point.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.227
Listen, gentlemen,
you're gonna go in soft,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.163
you're gonna come out heavy.
I expect it's gonna take

13:18.165 --> 13:19.697
a lot of noise to break Martin out.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.475
<i>No one has ever escaped Inferno</i>

13:30.477 --> 13:32.043
and you better believe
they are going to do

13:32.045 --> 13:33.678
everything in their power

13:33.680 --> 13:36.881
to stop you from taking
its most famous guest.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.316
It's just you, gentlemen.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.418
No plan B.
No back-up plan.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.188
No cavalry coming from behind
to save the day.

13:43.190 --> 13:47.158
Success or failure of this mission

13:47.160 --> 13:49.661
lies solely in your hands.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.882
Pretty impressive.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.521
Sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.623
You didn't.
Can I help you?

14:18.625 --> 14:20.692
You know, I don't think
I've ever met anyone

14:20.694 --> 14:22.560
with the name Mercy.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.395
Well, it wasn't the easiest name
to grow up with as a kid,

14:24.397 --> 14:26.097
but I survived.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.066
It's interesting.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.968
Your parents must've been
interesting people.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.404
I didn't know them very well.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.373
I read about how they died.
I'm sorry.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.277
It was a long time ago.

14:39.279 --> 14:42.580
It's a remarkable
coincidence, isn't it?

14:42.582 --> 14:44.249
What was?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.817
Well, the Russian
that you apprehended

14:45.819 --> 14:48.386
had ties to the United
National Defense Front.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.854
But I'm sure you knew that

14:49.856 --> 14:51.689
before the mission
even started, right?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.258
Excuse me?
That's why you didn't kill him.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.059
You needed info from him.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.129
I'm not allowed to discuss
details of my missions with you.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.269
How exactly did it go down?

15:04.271 --> 15:06.104
I mean, did he
offer it up right away

15:06.106 --> 15:09.374
or did you have to lean on him
a little bit?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.509
Conversation's over.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.548
<i>All due respect, colonel,
she's a civilian,</i>

15:17.550 --> 15:19.617
with no authority
to go digging around

15:19.619 --> 15:22.320
into classified information.
This is a decorated sergeant.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.922
Who you just cited in your report

15:23.924 --> 15:25.857
after he failed to follow orders.

15:25.859 --> 15:28.192
Look, according to
Sergeant Callo's file,

15:28.194 --> 15:30.695
when he was 13 years old
both of his parents were killed

15:30.697 --> 15:32.664
along with 300 other people

15:32.666 --> 15:35.199
when a Sierra Air jet
exploded over the Atlantic.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.869
The group that claimed
responsibility

15:37.871 --> 15:39.671
was the United National
Defense Front.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.006
The same group that your
Russian source belongs to

15:42.008 --> 15:43.608
and that has been linked to Martin

15:43.610 --> 15:45.543
several times in the past.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.647
And you think Sergeant Callo
is hunting Rudolph Martin?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.149
I think that Sergeant Callo

15:51.151 --> 15:52.784
may be hunting every single person

15:52.786 --> 15:55.019
that was responsible
for his parents' death.

15:55.021 --> 15:58.156
The mission, gentlemen,
is to get Martin here alive.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.092
You're suggesting that Sergeant
Callo can't follow orders?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.361
I'm not. But he did.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.197
Look, I can only imagine
how one would feel

16:06.199 --> 16:07.932
when coming face-to-face
with the man who killed

16:07.934 --> 16:09.867
someone they loved.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.537
I don't know how I'd react,
but if I had a gun handy

16:12.539 --> 16:14.072
when I was standing next to them,

16:14.074 --> 16:15.740
it might make my decision
more clear.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.809
Okay. Enough. Okay.

16:17.811 --> 16:21.546
Captain Wilkes, Agent Black,
get your team ready.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.082
Thank you, sir.
Sir.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.019
I gave you those files
to familiarize yourself

16:28.021 --> 16:29.787
with the men,
not psychoanalyze them.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.889
Look, this man's past
is his present.

16:31.891 --> 16:34.592
And resolve is within his reach.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.928
I'm sorry,
but if you want my opinion,

16:36.930 --> 16:39.230
he should not be
a part of this team.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.703
Yes?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.406
Is that confirmed?

16:51.443 --> 16:53.177
All right, get the men ready.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.183
Change of plans.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.919
We received intel that
an armored division

17:01.921 --> 17:04.255
departed a military base
outside of Grozny

17:04.257 --> 17:05.723
about 90 minutes ago.

17:05.724 --> 17:08.626
Unless they're about
to invade Georgia,

17:08.627 --> 17:11.496
they're en route
straight to Inferno.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.097
They're planning on moving him?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.932
Or maybe they just realized
there are folks like us

17:14.934 --> 17:17.667
who might just want
to try to come and get him,

17:17.670 --> 17:19.637
and they're taking precautions.

17:19.638 --> 17:23.141
Either way, we can't
have you fight an army.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.777
Obviously,
this moves up our timetable.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.679
The convoy should arrive
in approximately two hours.

17:28.681 --> 17:32.083
Our entire operation can last
no more than 90 minutes.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.485
We need 15 minutes
on either end for travel time,

17:34.487 --> 17:36.087
so that leaves
60 minutes to get in,

17:36.089 --> 17:37.989
get Martin and get out.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.725
Well, what are we waiting for?

18:48.527 --> 18:49.894
Go.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.710
They're through the fence.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.268
What's Sergeant Callo doing?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.403
It's a signal booster for when
the guys go underground.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.306
Helps with the radio,
EKG and video relays.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.624
<i>Bogey guard, 12 o'clock.</i>

20:00.265 --> 20:01.599
He sees them.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.958
They're in.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.728
Something's wrong.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.233
Take it down.

22:49.235 --> 22:51.001
Take it down.
Take it down.

22:55.273 --> 22:57.942
The key is not working.
Gonna blow the door.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.131
Callo, where are you?

23:20.133 --> 23:21.966
I'm in the hallway.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.868
What the hell's going on up there?

23:23.870 --> 23:25.669
I heard something.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.631
<i>Return to your position. Now.</i>

23:33.478 --> 23:35.846
Captain...

23:35.848 --> 23:37.314
Callo, repeat that.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.083
Almost there.
Stand by.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.319
What did Callo just say?

23:42.321 --> 23:44.822
<i>Did not copy, Callo. Repeat.</i>

23:57.436 --> 23:59.403
Perfect.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.915
I'm on to you, you wanker.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.517
I know you're the grass
in this prison.

24:13.519 --> 24:16.020
We're watching.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.193
Now your turn.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.031
Let's see what you've got.

24:37.776 --> 24:42.079
I offer you your freedom,
and this is all you've got?

24:42.081 --> 24:43.714
You're weak!

24:47.953 --> 24:49.420
Now my turn.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.308
Burn that body
and clean this shit up.

25:24.055 --> 25:27.424
And that's how you maintain
order within the inmates.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.961
With all due respect, warden,

25:30.963 --> 25:33.430
that was not order, that was chaos.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.467
Fuck you and your respect.

25:36.469 --> 25:38.936
If you'd sorted this out right
in the first place,

25:38.938 --> 25:40.938
I wouldn't be here
wiping your Chechen ass.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.475
Now, I know you're pissed off
that I got your position.

25:44.477 --> 25:47.378
But I suggest you get over it
very quickly.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.550
I was quite content

25:52.552 --> 25:55.986
never to visit the homeland
of my father ever again.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.790
But what you saw out there,
that was my mother's side.

25:59.792 --> 26:03.527
That was British blood
flowing through my veins.

26:03.529 --> 26:06.263
And I suggest
if you ever see it again,

26:06.265 --> 26:08.098
you should avoid it at all costs.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.967
Now get out.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.638
I've got things to do.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.034
You comfy there?

26:53.144 --> 26:54.678
Almost there.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.047
Standby. Standby.

26:58.650 --> 27:00.684
So where are they now?

27:00.686 --> 27:03.487
Southwest stairwell.
Everything's set.

27:03.489 --> 27:06.423
Just awaiting your orders.
Perfect.

27:15.033 --> 27:18.268
So, what are you waiting for?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.404
Let the show begin.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.440
Go, go, go!

27:28.780 --> 27:30.247
Aah!

27:32.217 --> 27:33.784
Whoa, what just happened?

27:40.892 --> 27:43.827
What's going on?
Sergeant, who's shooting?

27:43.829 --> 27:45.329
I don't know, sir.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.132
Are the cameras on night vision?

27:48.134 --> 27:51.168
- Take us off infrared.
- Yes, sir.

28:07.952 --> 28:10.721
Revolver Actual, this is
Revolver Main, do you hear me?

28:10.723 --> 28:14.291
Revolver Actual, this is
Revolver Main, do you read?

28:40.485 --> 28:42.553
Shit!

28:42.555 --> 28:44.455
I want him dead now!

28:55.467 --> 28:56.967
We need an image.
Let's go!

28:56.969 --> 28:58.235
Something's wrong.

29:09.548 --> 29:10.981
I'm on it.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.342
Got it.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.627
Colonel?

30:30.629 --> 30:32.462
They're calling in now.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.798
Okay.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.867
Excuse me, sergeant.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.870
Yes, ma'am.
Hi. Would it be possible for me

30:39.872 --> 30:41.572
to look at the video footage again?

30:41.574 --> 30:43.240
We can't tie up those monitors up.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.008
It's important.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.415
Warden Rudovsky?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.817
<i>Five confirmed dead.</i>

30:53.819 --> 30:56.320
I'm not interested in
the five that are dead.

30:56.322 --> 30:59.556
I'm only interested in the one
that's still alive.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.291
I have men checking
every single access door,

31:01.293 --> 31:03.093
but there are literally dozens.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.362
<i>There's barely enough room</i>
<i>to breathe in there,</i>

31:05.364 --> 31:08.432
<i>let alone move. He's most</i>
<i>likely caught inside somewhere.</i>

31:08.434 --> 31:10.234
Warden, look.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.554
So much for most likely, Alexi.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.092
Switch all these monitors
to Level Two feed.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.697
All guards on Level Two,
secure your stations.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.070
<i>I want this rat found now!</i>

31:59.017 --> 32:00.951
Revolver Main,
this is Revolver Actual,

32:00.953 --> 32:02.486
do you read me?

32:05.323 --> 32:09.226
Revolver Main, this is Revolver
Actual. Do you read me?

32:09.228 --> 32:10.661
Everything that's out there

32:10.663 --> 32:12.029
is in here on these back-up
servers.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.464
Should only take me
a second to sync up.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.938
What's this?

32:22.874 --> 32:24.841
That's transmitting
the team's frequency.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.510
Did you hear that?

32:26.512 --> 32:27.878
Ma'am?

32:27.880 --> 32:29.513
I thought I just heard something.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.715
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I didn't hear anything.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.050
Stop calling me ma'am.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.584
Can you roll this back
a few seconds?

32:34.586 --> 32:36.553
We're no longer recording.

32:40.525 --> 32:43.460
Revolver Actual, do you read me?

33:46.324 --> 33:48.325
<i>What the hell's going on out there?</i>

33:48.327 --> 33:50.427
<i>In the hallway, I heard something.</i>

33:50.429 --> 33:52.129
<i>Return to your position, now.</i>

33:52.131 --> 33:53.997
<i>- Almost there.</i>
<i>- Standby!</i>

33:56.602 --> 33:58.969
<i>Standby! Aah!</i>

34:29.801 --> 34:31.301
<i>I'm told we can have a team there</i>

34:31.303 --> 34:33.303
<i>and ready to go</i>
<i>in less than four hours.</i>

34:33.304 --> 34:35.438
With all due respect,
Mr. President,

34:35.440 --> 34:37.574
I'm not so sure
how much good it will do.

34:37.576 --> 34:41.078
Latest satellites confirm
the Chechens have mobilized

34:41.080 --> 34:44.281
an armored division
from the north toward Inferno.

34:44.283 --> 34:47.650
They will be arriving
in approximately 90 minutes.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.821
Any second team
would not simply be fighting

34:50.822 --> 34:54.224
a group of guards,
but an army as well.

34:54.226 --> 34:57.127
<i>Thank you, colonel.</i>

35:00.865 --> 35:02.566
They're not all dead.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.947
Do you have a weapon?

35:16.949 --> 35:18.415
I'm going to take my hand away.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.351
You make a noise or move, you die.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.019
You understand?

35:25.189 --> 35:26.890
I do not wish to die.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.493
You will get no fight
from me. I promise.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.928
Good to know.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.530
I know why you're here.

35:33.532 --> 35:36.900
Yeah? Why is that?

35:36.902 --> 35:39.536
Do not kill me,
and I will take you to his cell.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.238
Whose cell?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.373
Rudolph Martin.

35:45.176 --> 35:48.044
You're basing your theory
that Callo's alive on this?

35:48.046 --> 35:50.814
Primarily, yes.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.582
Also, a few moments ago,

35:52.584 --> 35:55.485
someone tried contacting us
on the team's secure channel.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.954
What did they say?

35:57.956 --> 35:59.456
Well, it was just static,

35:59.458 --> 36:01.291
but I know that something
was there.

36:01.293 --> 36:05.295
That's my man. If he's alive,
we're gonna go get him.

36:05.297 --> 36:07.264
Hold on.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.200
Nobody's going to get anyone, okay?

36:10.202 --> 36:12.903
Even if this could be
authenticated,

36:12.905 --> 36:15.539
there's still not enough
evidence to warrant any action.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.974
I'm sorry.

36:26.884 --> 36:28.351
What are you doing?

36:28.353 --> 36:32.088
You heard the man.
He needs evidence.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.295
I knew he was big shot.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.096
He's terrorist, right?

36:40.098 --> 36:42.666
Heh. Americans,
it's always terrorist.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.634
You people must miss the Cold War.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.937
Why do you say that?

36:46.939 --> 36:49.239
At least we wore uniforms.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.713
You no trust me?
Don't take it personally.

36:58.849 --> 37:00.784
That's why you are lucky

37:00.786 --> 37:02.519
you ran into me
when you did, my friend.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.256
I can show you the way.

37:06.258 --> 37:09.259
How do you say, not normal way,
but back way, the back...

37:09.261 --> 37:11.461
I understand.

37:12.863 --> 37:15.198
And you take me with you
to America?

37:15.200 --> 37:16.700
What?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.034
That is the deal.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.203
We're making deals?

37:20.205 --> 37:22.872
I do for you, you for me.
Is fair?

37:22.874 --> 37:25.275
No. Not fair.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.444
Then you can find him yourself.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.280
Should be easy, all alone,

37:30.282 --> 37:33.583
with the entire prison guard
population looking for you.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.086
And you absolutely know
where he is?

37:36.088 --> 37:37.687
I bring him his medicine every day.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.489
What medicine?

37:39.491 --> 37:42.726
Needles and insulin
for blood sugar. You know.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.961
He's diabetic?
Yes.

37:47.131 --> 37:48.698
If you're not being
straight with me...

37:48.700 --> 37:51.768
I don't understand.
"Being straight"?

37:55.072 --> 37:58.508
If you take me anywhere
besides Martin's cell...

37:58.510 --> 38:00.777
I understand.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.447
So we have a deal?

38:07.084 --> 38:09.419
Let's go.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.168
Lev?

38:25.170 --> 38:26.569
Yes, sir.
Get in here.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.439
What the fuck is that?

38:29.441 --> 38:31.408
That's north stairwell,
between Two and Three.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.776
I will have it fixed immediately.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.244
It's not broken.

38:34.246 --> 38:36.279
He's not trying to get out.

38:40.751 --> 38:43.386
Is okay here.
No video.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.854
How much further?

38:44.856 --> 38:46.990
Not much now. Just here.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.858
At the end, on the right.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.861
That door, then into another.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.839
Hey. I thought solitary
was in the basement?

39:02.841 --> 39:05.975
I don't know what you know.
I only know he's here.

39:50.588 --> 39:52.055
The key?

39:54.925 --> 39:56.626
Never mind.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.796
This opens all doors.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.465
Is better than Black Amex.

40:37.501 --> 40:39.669
Not another step.

41:10.668 --> 41:13.503
<i>The American is in the gym.</i>

41:17.575 --> 41:19.542
Who just said that?

41:31.755 --> 41:34.390
You better hurry.
Alexi! Come in.

41:34.392 --> 41:36.159
<i>Copy, warden.
What are your instructions?</i>

41:36.161 --> 41:37.594
Change of plans.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.574
This way!

43:27.805 --> 43:31.274
<i>Alexi, come in.
Are you there? Report!</i>

43:34.345 --> 43:36.112
<i>Alexi!</i>

43:36.114 --> 43:38.481
I'll give you my car
if you answer him.

43:44.922 --> 43:46.322
Colonel, may I have a word?

43:46.324 --> 43:47.790
What is it?

43:50.094 --> 43:51.628
You said you wanted evidence.

43:55.232 --> 43:59.068
Here, this is moments
before the attack.

43:59.070 --> 44:01.037
Okay, um...

44:05.376 --> 44:08.645
Here, the keycard
that got us inside the prison

44:08.647 --> 44:11.180
and through the first three doors,

44:11.182 --> 44:15.084
suddenly stops working.
And then...

44:15.086 --> 44:18.254
Here.
The lights turn on.

44:18.256 --> 44:21.924
Blinds the team
and the guards enter, blasting.

44:21.926 --> 44:23.726
They knew we were coming.

44:23.728 --> 44:25.762
They let us in.

44:25.764 --> 44:27.697
They knew which route
we were going to take.

44:27.699 --> 44:30.867
They waited for the entire team
to get inside the stairwell

44:30.869 --> 44:32.769
and then they attacked.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.941
Colonel,
there's an informer among us.

44:40.611 --> 44:42.211
Hmm.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.415
Did I ask you to do this?

44:47.217 --> 44:48.651
No. You said you wanted...

44:48.653 --> 44:50.753
Have you shown it to anyone?

44:50.755 --> 44:53.056
No.

44:53.058 --> 44:56.259
Have you told anyone
what you just told me?

44:56.261 --> 44:58.194
No.

44:59.596 --> 45:02.065
Don't.

45:11.742 --> 45:15.411
Your father was a great hero
here in Chechnya, Alexi.

45:17.114 --> 45:20.149
You must be a great
disappointment to him.

45:20.151 --> 45:23.553
We should alert
the perimeter guards

45:23.555 --> 45:25.822
the American is on his way.

45:25.824 --> 45:27.423
He's not going to the perimeter.

45:27.425 --> 45:29.525
Yeah?

45:33.597 --> 45:38.167
Sasha, take two of
your best men to solitary.

45:38.169 --> 45:40.336
Bring the prisoner here,
I want him in my quarters.

45:40.338 --> 45:42.305
Yes, warden.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.377
Are you still here?

46:11.869 --> 46:14.170
Yuri!

46:14.172 --> 46:16.873
Where is that fat son of a bitch?

46:16.875 --> 46:19.075
Stand back.

46:49.206 --> 46:50.807
Which one is he in?

46:50.809 --> 46:52.241
I don't know.

47:08.258 --> 47:10.193
Shit, no signal.

47:18.702 --> 47:20.436
That good, huh?

47:20.438 --> 47:22.605
Oh. Heh. Yeah.

47:22.607 --> 47:24.140
Pentagon will spend
$500 on a hammer

47:24.142 --> 47:26.108
but when it comes to coffee,

47:26.110 --> 47:28.271
that's where they're gonna
ease the tax payers' burden.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.649
Look, we got off on
the wrong foot, all right?

47:33.651 --> 47:35.218
I'm not usually this big a prick.

47:35.220 --> 47:38.087
How big of a prick are you usually?

47:39.791 --> 47:41.257
Right.

47:41.259 --> 47:43.426
Look, you impressed me
in there. All right?

47:43.428 --> 47:46.762
You convinced me.
Thanks.

47:46.764 --> 47:48.431
How well do you know the colonel?

47:48.433 --> 47:50.066
Pretty well, actually.

47:50.068 --> 47:52.401
He and my father served together.

47:52.403 --> 47:54.270
We haven't spoken in years, so...

47:54.272 --> 47:55.905
Did you know his son?

47:55.907 --> 47:59.442
Yeah.
Do you know Robert?

47:59.444 --> 48:02.078
Well, no. I mean, I heard
the stories of his death.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.346
What?

48:04.848 --> 48:06.682
I'm sorry. I figured
you would have known.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.554
How did he, uh...?

48:11.556 --> 48:13.422
Suicide.

48:17.361 --> 48:20.263
Special Agent Black.

48:20.265 --> 48:21.931
The colonel would like to see you.

48:24.334 --> 48:25.701
Sorry.

48:55.766 --> 48:57.300
Natalie Meyers.

48:57.302 --> 48:59.702
<i>This is Sergeant Mercy Callo.</i>

48:59.704 --> 49:01.437
I'm sorry, could you speak up?

49:01.439 --> 49:04.240
This is Sergeant Mercy Callo.

49:04.242 --> 49:06.609
Look, I'm sorry,
but you're breaking up.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.879
Could you just repeat yourself?
<i>Mercy Callo.</i>

49:09.881 --> 49:11.714
Is this a joke?
<i>No.</i>

49:11.716 --> 49:14.116
You ask me insulting questions
about my dead parents

49:14.118 --> 49:16.652
and you think
I'm going to ignore orders.

49:16.654 --> 49:19.088
<i>Can we just skip to the part</i>
<i>where you believe me now?</i>

49:19.090 --> 49:21.457
Holy shit.
I knew you were alive.

49:21.459 --> 49:24.760
I'm in solitary,
I'm about to intercept Martin.

49:31.002 --> 49:32.268
Huh?

49:34.871 --> 49:37.707
Warden Rudovsky!
Warden Rudovsky!

49:37.709 --> 49:40.109
Something's wrong.
What's wrong?

49:53.256 --> 49:56.158
Code Red.
Prisoner's escaped.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.780
<i>♪ Hey ♪</i>

50:19.916 --> 50:22.752
<i>♪ Now you've heard it</i>
<i>All before ♪</i>

50:22.754 --> 50:25.287
<i>♪ Can't take no more ♪</i>

50:25.289 --> 50:27.209
<i>♪ Girl, let me show you</i>
<i>How much I have changed ♪</i>

51:20.744 --> 51:23.145
I never learned to do this.

51:28.385 --> 51:30.186
Lose something?

51:51.174 --> 51:53.809
Yuri!

51:53.811 --> 51:56.145
Where is that fat son of a bitch?

51:56.147 --> 51:58.013
Stand back.

52:17.435 --> 52:19.001
Huh?

52:20.504 --> 52:22.204
Warden Rudovsky!

52:22.206 --> 52:23.839
<i>Warden Rudovsky!</i>

52:26.243 --> 52:28.043
Something's wrong.

52:28.045 --> 52:30.346
What's wrong?

52:30.348 --> 52:33.015
Mercy, stay on the line, okay?

52:38.221 --> 52:41.323
Code Red.
Prisoner's escaped.

53:05.982 --> 53:08.450
Colonel Harding?

53:08.452 --> 53:11.520
Colonel Harding, I have
Sergeant Callo on the line.

53:11.522 --> 53:12.888
Come again?

53:12.890 --> 53:15.124
I have Sergeant Callo on the line.

53:17.460 --> 53:19.195
Hello, Mercy?

53:21.565 --> 53:23.933
Mercy, are you there?

53:25.268 --> 53:27.903
Sir?
He's gone.

54:01.871 --> 54:03.405
Not so tough.

54:12.148 --> 54:14.083
Tough enough.

54:14.085 --> 54:16.118
Martin!

54:16.120 --> 54:18.053
Hands where I can see them.

54:22.125 --> 54:23.959
What did he say exactly?

54:23.961 --> 54:25.995
He said he was in solitary,

54:25.997 --> 54:28.030
attempting to intercept Martin.

54:28.032 --> 54:30.799
Was that all?
Yes. Uh, no.

54:30.801 --> 54:32.601
He said something was wrong.

54:32.603 --> 54:34.603
No shit. What did he say?

54:34.605 --> 54:36.472
He didn't say what it was.

54:36.474 --> 54:37.873
Sir, we traced the number.

54:37.875 --> 54:39.708
The call definitely came
from Inferno prison.

54:39.710 --> 54:43.345
Thank you, sergeant. Why do
you think he called you?

54:43.347 --> 54:44.947
I gave him my card before he left.

54:44.949 --> 54:47.850
Maybe it was the only number
he had handy.

54:47.852 --> 54:51.053
And you believe it was him?
Yes, sir, I do.

54:51.055 --> 54:53.022
Obviously he's trying
to finish the mission.

54:53.024 --> 54:54.957
We can't let him do this alone.

54:56.826 --> 54:59.495
Well, you got me at a
disadvantage. You know my name.

54:59.497 --> 55:03.699
Now, who exactly are you?

55:03.701 --> 55:07.503
Okay. Guessing by your accent,
I would say you're American.

55:07.505 --> 55:10.105
Marines? CIA?

55:10.107 --> 55:13.108
None of the above?

55:13.110 --> 55:15.244
The cuff's on the ground,
by the guard.

55:15.246 --> 55:17.513
Take 'em and lock your wrists.

55:17.515 --> 55:19.982
That explains why
they were coming for me.

55:19.984 --> 55:21.684
To move me to keep you
from getting me.

55:21.686 --> 55:23.452
What happened out in the world?

55:23.454 --> 55:26.588
Take the cuffs
and lock your wrists.

55:26.590 --> 55:28.257
And what if I don't?

55:31.328 --> 55:34.863
Wow, you shoot the floor,
that's very impressive.

55:36.733 --> 55:38.534
Here's what I think
is gonna happen.

55:38.536 --> 55:40.202
The big boy here
already sounded the alarm.

55:40.204 --> 55:43.005
So right now, there's more
guards coming as we speak.

55:43.007 --> 55:45.441
You want me alive,
so you're not gonna shoot me.

55:45.443 --> 55:47.776
And if they wanted me dead,
they would've already killed me.

55:47.778 --> 55:49.845
So...

55:51.981 --> 55:54.983
I'd say you're screwed, buddy.

56:36.793 --> 56:38.827
That was some really pretty
kicking.

56:40.830 --> 56:42.331
Very nice.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.833
You like that?
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty.

56:44.835 --> 56:46.568
You might like this.

56:53.977 --> 56:55.644
Don't go nowhere.

57:01.918 --> 57:05.421
I told you they would come.
Shut your mouth.

57:13.596 --> 57:15.297
This is bullshit!

57:28.344 --> 57:30.479
Why don't you do some more kicking?

57:32.816 --> 57:34.316
Oh, that'll work.

58:28.872 --> 58:31.073
I need a clear path out of here.

58:32.909 --> 58:35.110
If you think I'm going to help
you get out, you're insane!

58:35.112 --> 58:37.212
How many guards
have I already killed?

58:37.214 --> 58:39.715
How many more do
you want to see me kill?

58:39.717 --> 58:41.650
You can spare them.

58:49.526 --> 58:51.927
There is a passage.

59:00.304 --> 59:02.371
Put it on speaker.
No shit.

59:06.376 --> 59:07.709
Sergeant Callo?

59:07.711 --> 59:09.111
<i>This is Natalie Meyers.</i>

59:09.113 --> 59:10.546
<i>Can you hear us?</i>
<i>Is that you?</i>

59:10.548 --> 59:12.347
Yes, it's me.

59:12.349 --> 59:14.550
<i>Mercy, it's Kyle.
Are you okay?</i>

59:14.552 --> 59:16.218
I'm fine.
I may have a way out

59:16.220 --> 59:18.020
that should have
minimal resistance.

59:18.022 --> 59:21.056
<i>Sergeant Callo, this
is Colonel Harding.</i>

59:21.058 --> 59:23.559
- Do you have the package?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

59:23.561 --> 59:25.827
But he has assured me
he will not go willingly.

59:25.829 --> 59:28.297
<i>Can you subdue him?</i>

59:28.299 --> 59:30.799
I can, but if I have to go up
eight flights,

59:30.801 --> 59:34.436
carrying a 200-pound man,
I don't like my odds, sir.

59:36.707 --> 59:38.240
Hang on the line, sergeant.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.075
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Martin has to believe

59:40.077 --> 59:42.210
that we're his only
chance for survival.

59:42.212 --> 59:44.179
How is he going to do that?

59:44.181 --> 59:46.481
Natalie, this is a terrorist.

59:46.483 --> 59:48.650
A good one.
He won't believe you

59:48.652 --> 59:51.420
if you're thinking about
some bullshit immunity deal.

59:51.422 --> 59:53.522
I wasn't going to suggest that.
May I?

59:57.794 --> 01:00:00.696
Sergeant Callo,
does Martin know where he is?

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:02.698
He knows he's in prison.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.734
Does he know he's in Chechnya?
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:07.636
He's heard a bunch of folks
speaking Russian.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:11.673
So he probably thinks
he's in Russia.

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:13.008
He has friends there that remember

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.644
how he helped them during the war.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:18.480
He's probably just waiting
to talk to somebody in charge.

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:22.451
Mercy, you tell him
he's in Chechnya,

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:26.421
he knows it's only a matter
of time before he's killed.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:28.423
Okay. Is the extraction plan
still in place?

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:30.492
Yes. Look, you have 40 minutes.

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:32.961
Chechen ground forces
will be there in 55 minutes.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:35.564
- I know it's cutting it close.
<i>- We'll be there, sir.</i>

01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:36.999
<i>How can we contact you?</i>

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:39.034
I swiped a cell phone.

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:42.137
Once I can get some reception,
I'll text you the number I have.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.474
Mercy, this is the only shot we
have to get you out of there.

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:47.009
Once the window closes,

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:49.811
<i>you're on your own.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.347
Yes, sir.
Good luck, Mercy.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.082
<i>Ms. Meyers?</i>

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.418
Yes?

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.487
Thanks for answering the phone.

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:00.656
Of course.

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:11.767
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:17.706
If the warden find out
I helped you escape,

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:22.177
he'll not only kill me,
he kills my entire family.

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:29.451
I understand.

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:57.846
You know, you kicked me,
I punched you.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.915
I think I deserve
a first name at least.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.291
What is this?

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:14.062
When you were brought in,
were you blindfolded?

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.363
Maybe unconscious?

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:18.300
Why do you care?

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:19.634
You tell me.

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.002
Check the IDs again.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.342
You're in Chechnya.

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:29.978
Seems as though
this prison ain't enough.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.280
The Chechens have
ground forces en route.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:34.483
We have 40 minutes
to get you out of here.

01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:36.485
So you can either cooperate with me

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:39.121
or I'm gonna leave
your ass to them.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:40.589
It's your choice.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.726
Untie me.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:52.000
Come out, come out,

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:53.802
wherever you are.

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.372
Warden, we found him.

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:03.812
Kyle, it's him.

01:03:03.814 --> 01:03:06.214
They're moving through
the cell block now.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.749
They? Does that mean
he has Martin?

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:10.418
Well, this is all it says.
All right. May I?

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.220
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.823
I'm going to input the cell,

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:17.692
and track it through
the phone's GPS.

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:20.195
How do you do that?
Really?

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:21.963
CIA spy stuff.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.665
I can read his text,
check his email,

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:26.568
even listen to his music
if I want to. Thanks.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.308
I can't get service at my apartment,

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.411
but five floors below ground
in Chechnya, no problem.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.680
You know, I'm not a terrorist.

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:41.750
You keep telling yourself that.
You really believe

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:44.152
that the United States
are the good guys, don't you?

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.154
Compared to you, we're angels.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.722
Oh, yeah? What about
the Native Americans?

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.624
Or, hey, what about
the African slaves?

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:52.027
Or what about the wives
of the guards you just killed?

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:54.362
You really think
they would call you an angel?

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:57.399
Would you just lower your voice?

01:03:57.401 --> 01:03:57.999
Sure.

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.506
You have absolutely no idea
where we're going, do you?

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.209
I know exactly where I'm going.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:08.643
It doesn't look like it.

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.914
Why do think terrorism exists?

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:15.450
You believe al Qaeda
likes sleeping in caves

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:18.553
and living in fear?
They live in fear?

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.755
Of course they do.

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:22.357
What about the United
National Defense Front,

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.559
they live in fear too?
Yeah, naturally so.

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:27.562
No. They hide like roaches

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.831
because they put bombs on children

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:32.968
and send them into restaurants
and soccer stadiums

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.870
and airplanes.

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:36.805
They don't live in fear.

01:04:36.807 --> 01:04:39.674
You need to be human to be afraid.

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:42.177
They're evil,

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.546
just like you.

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:48.583
Now whose voice needs lowering?

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:55.056
Wakey, wakey!

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:01.062
You know why you're here,
now talk to me.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.698
Why are you the only guard
he left alive?

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:20.248
I don't know what their plans were.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.850
Their plans?

01:05:21.852 --> 01:05:24.152
So they're a team now, are they?

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:26.821
They've been looking for an exit

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:29.024
with the least
amount of resistance.

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.461
There it is.

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:36.998
The exit on Level Seven.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.767
Leads straight out of the prison.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:41.369
This is it. This is
the fire exit. Come on.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.208
They'd have been home free,

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:50.378
except I had the guards
seal all the exits.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.847
I think I forgot
to mention it to you.

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:57.185
Lev, switch all these monitors
to the Level Seven feed.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.192
It's welded shut.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.361
So don't you guys carry C4

01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:08.096
or something to blow shit up with?

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:10.732
Got a grenade.
I could blow up the door

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:13.702
but it's gonna take down
the wall and the ceiling.

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.572
Hello, fellas.

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.579
We gotta go.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:28.416
Now how do you think
I knew about that exit?

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.586
Detailed information, satellites.

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:35.390
So that's your story.

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.728
Shut down all electronic locks
on the main population.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:41.162
Yes, warden.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:50.338
Come on.

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:55.176
What's the matter?
Card's not working.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.911
What do you mean
the card is not working?

01:06:56.913 --> 01:06:59.414
You're not swiping it right.
I swiped. It's not working.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.716
Then push the numbers,
something. Punch it.

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:04.185
Warden Rudovsky.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.389
We have reinforcements
arriving within the hour.

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:08.923
I fail to see how sending in

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:11.092
what few guards
we have left will do.

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:13.261
With twice as many,
we could not stop them.

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:19.334
Who said anything about
sending in the guards?

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:25.006
Now sit your arse down there
and keep out of my sight!

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.553
Attention, all Inferno staff...

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:42.390
<i>report to the main entrance,
Level One, immediately.</i>

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.840
This can't be good.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.675
Attention, all prisoners.

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:03.711
<i>This is Warden Rudovsky.</i>

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:06.347
<i>We have two strangers</i>
<i>in our prison.</i>

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:10.685
<i>The man that brings me</i>
<i>these men, dead or alive,</i>

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:12.353
will receive a full pardon.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:17.058
Shit.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.895
Unlock all the cells.

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:23.598
All of them?

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.533
Every single one.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.096
Rudovsky, you've gone insane.

01:09:29.099 --> 01:09:31.599
We will never be able to get
control of this prison again!

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.902
Never!
Maybe.

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:37.305
But that is no concern of yours.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:38.773
Guards.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.308
What is the meaning of this?

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.076
Get this piece of shit out!

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:44.312
Rudovsky, what are you doing?

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:46.747
Get him out of here.
What you are doing?

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.483
What you are doing?

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:50.952
Rudovsky!
Rudovsky!

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.220
Rudovsky!

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.592
Look, not to insult
your kung fu or anything,

01:09:57.594 --> 01:10:00.061
but I think those AKs might
have really helped us there.

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:01.963
I checked all the AKs,
the AKs are out.

01:10:01.965 --> 01:10:03.865
Oh, you checked every single
one of those hundred guns?

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.700
They were all out?
Not a single bullet.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:07.468
We've got 30 minutes
to get out of here...

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.431
The key!

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:42.136
Do something!

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.411
You ever wish you would have
gone to dental school?

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.620
Look, if you want to survive this,

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:00.855
you got to start trusting me.

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:07.028
All right.
Making deals with the devil.

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:10.398
Well, we each our own devil,
and we make this world our hell.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.367
You make that up yourself?

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:14.435
No, that was Oscar Wilde.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.037
All right.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.008
All right.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:22.610
We got four bullets left,

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.512
we got 30 minutes until extraction

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:27.682
and the entire Inferno
prison's out to kill us.

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.083
You're ready?

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:31.519
Yeah, yeah, I feel pumped.
Let's go.

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:38.593
Let me go!
Get your hands off me!

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.942
Open the gate!

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:56.544
Open the gate!

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.716
There he is.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.043
Have they crossed in yet?

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:30.878
Yes, sir.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.547
And do they have line of sight?

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.182
Yes, sir.

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:35.850
Hey, what's going on?

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:38.286
We're going in to get them.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:43.224
They're radio silent
right now, right?

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:45.159
- Yes, sir.
- They're in whisper mode?

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:52.033
Come in.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:55.203
Colonel, I'm so sorry
to disturb you.

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:58.206
How can I help you?

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:02.009
Well, I heard we're going
to pick up Mercy and Martin.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.979
Yes. They got the go-ahead
only a few moments ago.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:07.048
Still working on the plan.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.617
How does that usually work?

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:12.253
Who decides on the location?

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:13.621
Who gives the order?

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:16.290
Why are you asking?

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:20.928
Sir, I strongly believe
there's an informer among us,

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.764
who knew our plans going in.
Natalie...

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.766
If that's the case,
then any extraction plan

01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:27.468
could also wind up in enemy hands.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.905
I came up with the location
and I alone will relay that

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:33.474
to the extraction team
and Sergeant Callo

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:35.676
only after they've departed.

01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:38.980
I will also be ordering
all mobile devices confiscated

01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:41.849
10 minutes prior to departure time.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.651
While simultaneously shutting down

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:48.289
Internet access
on the base. Satisfied?

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:50.124
Yes, sir, thank you.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.999
Colonel, I was sorry
to hear about Robbie.

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.670
I didn't know.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:07.675
If you'd please
prep the interrogation room

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:10.144
in anticipation of our guests.

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:11.646
Of course.

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.569
Not good.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.805
Really not good.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:41.075
That one's mine.

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:43.544
Save the bullets.
Are you sure?

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:45.480
No.

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.850
All right.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:51.953
Here we go.

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.774
What's going on?

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:48.209
You done?

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.912
I'm done.

01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:01.856
Oh, shit.

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.959
You can use those bullets now.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.334
Come on, come on.

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.203
Hold the door.
Hold it.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.007
A little help.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.011
That club won't hold
for long. This way.

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:27.114
Which way now?
Through the main cell block?

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.082
Oh, great. Awesome!

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:35.356
Extraction team leader,
you are go for launch.

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:41.295
<i>Power control levers going to fly.</i>

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:43.431
<i>Revolver Actual, Revolver 16.</i>

01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:45.700
<i>We have departed for extraction.</i>

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.537
Almost out of here.

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:55.142
All right.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:57.211
Fellas...
Tony, Frank...

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:02.750
All right.

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:04.251
We don't need to do this, do we?

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:07.054
We do? We gotta do it.
Okay, two at a time.

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:13.027
All right, well...

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:19.433
We were given an option
to bring you in

01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:23.904
dead or alive.

01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:25.573
Choose.

01:17:25.575 --> 01:17:27.274
Anyone ever chosen dead?

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:31.345
That's Kong, king of the inmates.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.280
Look, I don't think we...
Hold up.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:36.450
Are you afraid of me?

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.722
What?
You can't hear me up there?

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:43.824
I said, are you afraid of me?

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:50.498
When I was a boy,
a gang broke into my home,

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.969
murdered my father,
raped my mother and sisters,

01:17:54.971 --> 01:17:58.339
tortured me, left us all for dead.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.775
I was the only survivor.

01:18:00.777 --> 01:18:03.277
When police found me,
they said the gang

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.012
would most likely come back
to kill me

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.248
because I was witness.

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.683
I was 10.

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:13.621
I wasn't scared then.

01:18:13.623 --> 01:18:16.223
I am not scared now.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.221
That was a very touching speech.
Just give me a second.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:24.165
You and me.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.434
You keep these others back.

01:18:26.436 --> 01:18:28.769
If you win, you get me dead

01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:30.337
and him alive.

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:34.175
As you wish.

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:39.847
All right.
Um, can I talk...?

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:42.750
Can I just talk to you
for a second?

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:44.285
I think you got
hit on the head a lot.

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:45.786
Keep an eye on the other one.

01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:49.323
This is a terrible idea.
You got four shots left.

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:52.093
Anything happens to me,
you get to the extraction point.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.664
Trust.

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:06.340
Sir, satellites confirm
the Chechen Army

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.876
should arrive at Inferno
in approximately 30 minutes.

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:11.746
They've picked up their pace.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:18.886
Should be over very soon.

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:38.405
Boom! Finish him.

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.599
Are you kidding me!

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.870
Hold it.

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:47.208
All right.

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:49.677
How about instead of one pardon,

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:51.078
we all get out of here?

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:57.084
What are you talking about?

01:20:57.086 --> 01:21:00.154
I got the key to the front door.

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:02.189
Right here.

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:18.572
Robert was sick.

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:21.475
After returning from Afghanistan,

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:24.778
he complained of headaches, nausea,

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.047
but mostly nightmares.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:30.284
I told him it was just stress.

01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:32.553
Of being in combat.

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:37.258
That I had gone through what he had

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.893
and it would all pass.

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.963
But they didn't.

01:21:42.965 --> 01:21:45.566
I brought him in for tests,

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:49.069
and the doctors at the VA
pronounced him healthy.

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:52.973
That all he needed was some rest.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:57.111
I believed them.

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.946
Robert didn't.

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:03.550
He would act out, lose his temper.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:08.689
I told him, you got to stop
acting like this and...

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:12.860
grow up.

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:19.099
Ah. It was two weeks
before we found his body.

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:22.970
I'm so sorry.

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:28.509
Right.

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:35.115
Worse than losing a child, Natalie,

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:40.854
is having someone convince you
to side against him.

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:47.755
Warden, there's been an
explosion by the front entrance.

01:23:47.757 --> 01:23:50.991
The prisoners are escaping.

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:53.827
Warden?
Did you hear me?

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:00.401
The guards are outnumbered.

01:24:00.403 --> 01:24:01.969
Warden!

01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:01.395
All right, the extraction point
is approximately one mile north,

01:25:01.397 --> 01:25:03.997
through that forest,
in a burned-out village.

01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:05.499
We got about 10 minutes.

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.249
Get the fuck up!

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:03.824
Well, I guess your new friend
just took off.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:05.659
Let me tell you something.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:09.696
These terrorists,

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:12.199
they're not as loyal
as they used to be.

01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:16.203
So you think you defeated
my prison single-handedly.

01:26:16.205 --> 01:26:19.840
Well, you forgot about one thing.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.228
Sierra Air Flight 19.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.131
Your tattoo.

01:26:44.133 --> 01:26:45.933
That's the flight number.
Yeah?

01:26:45.935 --> 01:26:48.735
You also mentioned the United
National Defense Front

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:50.704
and bombs on planes.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.606
It's the only airline
to be hit by that group.

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:07.020
Who did you lose?

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.257
My parents.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.695
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:19.666
I think you should hold on to this.

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:21.134
They'll shoot me on sight.

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.137
Let's go.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:39.386
This is an Eagle .50.

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:52.833
Revolver Actual,

01:27:52.835 --> 01:27:55.335
Revolver 16 is 10 minutes out
from extraction.

01:27:55.337 --> 01:27:56.770
<i>Roger.</i>

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:59.139
This way.

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:14.054
I thought you said we had time.

01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:15.422
We did.

01:28:15.424 --> 01:28:17.291
Oh. So they're just early.

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:18.692
They're not just early.

01:28:18.694 --> 01:28:20.661
They're not even
supposed to be here.

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:27.000
Are you texting?

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:29.503
We need to find another route.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.916
Colonel!

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:44.418
Let's go.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.323
Almost there, Rudolph.

01:29:58.394 --> 01:29:59.726
Hang in there.

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:11.605
Get us out of here!

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:36.496
Sir, no bullet exit.
How far out?

01:30:36.498 --> 01:30:39.266
Roger. Stop what you can,
push fluids as needed.

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:42.102
Rudolph, you're gonna be
fine, Rudolph.

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:43.603
You're gonna be okay.

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:49.376
What?

01:30:49.378 --> 01:30:53.213
Not Martin.

01:31:18.573 --> 01:31:20.574
<i>We're still in the process</i>

01:31:20.576 --> 01:31:22.375
of gathering
all pertinent information.

01:31:22.377 --> 01:31:25.745
At this time, it appears
the man currently in custody

01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:28.181
is not Rudolph Martin.

01:31:28.183 --> 01:31:30.183
It is someone
employed to be his double.

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:49.703
Did you lose something?
Yes, thank you.

01:31:49.705 --> 01:31:51.137
Come in.

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:56.243
It's a Gobrecht. 1836?

01:31:56.245 --> 01:31:58.645
It's worth a few thousand dollars.

01:31:58.647 --> 01:32:00.480
Yes. You know your coins.

01:32:00.482 --> 01:32:03.149
I collected as a kid.

01:32:03.151 --> 01:32:04.618
Did you?

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.953
No. My father did.

01:32:06.955 --> 01:32:08.388
This was his coin.

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:14.294
So, heh, how are you feeling?

01:32:14.296 --> 01:32:17.330
Pretty crappy, to be honest.

01:32:17.332 --> 01:32:20.133
But I'll be okay.

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.037
How's, uh...

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:26.306
I don't know
what you're calling him.

01:32:26.308 --> 01:32:30.277
Oh, we're calling him
the Martin Double.

01:32:30.279 --> 01:32:34.314
He's not good.
Actually, um,

01:32:34.316 --> 01:32:36.983
he's in critical condition.

01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:40.186
What does it matter anyway?

01:32:40.188 --> 01:32:42.856
Mercy, it matters a great deal.

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:49.195
Listen to me, okay?

01:32:49.197 --> 01:32:52.866
This could be
a very high value asset.

01:32:52.868 --> 01:32:54.968
If he survives...
I mean, you said yourself,

01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:56.903
he knows Martin's work.

01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:59.940
He could know his location,
his connections,

01:32:59.942 --> 01:33:03.143
possible targets,
I mean, the list goes on.

01:33:03.145 --> 01:33:05.345
We won't know for sure
until we talk to him,

01:33:05.347 --> 01:33:08.782
but this could be
a very good thing.

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:14.154
I don't want to take up
too much of your time.

01:33:14.156 --> 01:33:16.923
But I just, um...

01:33:16.925 --> 01:33:18.959
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:23.830
I was wrong about you.

01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:27.934
And what you did was nothing
short of a miracle.

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:30.870
I couldn't have done it
without you.

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:33.640
You saved my life.

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:39.679
Feel better.

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:48.722
Mercy, what exactly happened
at the extraction site?

01:34:05.641 --> 01:34:07.841
Do you have a sec?

01:34:07.843 --> 01:34:09.963
Yeah. I was gonna stop by
the infirmary on my way out.

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:13.847
You're leaving?

01:34:13.849 --> 01:34:15.615
Already called back to Washington.

01:34:15.617 --> 01:34:17.517
But I have a couple of minutes.
What's up?

01:34:17.519 --> 01:34:20.086
I don't really know how to begin.

01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:22.055
Earlier today, when I was
watching footage of the team,

01:34:22.057 --> 01:34:26.593
it was fairly obvious to me
that we had been set up.

01:34:26.595 --> 01:34:28.595
Excuse me. What?

01:34:28.597 --> 01:34:31.131
The Chechens knew
that we were coming.

01:34:31.133 --> 01:34:33.667
You have this on tape?

01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:38.838
Well, it's not so cut and dry,
but yeah.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.509
I went to Colonel Harding
with what I had, and...

01:34:42.511 --> 01:34:44.411
And?

01:34:44.413 --> 01:34:47.213
And he didn't...
And he didn't believe me.

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:52.686
After we found out
that Mercy was alive

01:34:52.688 --> 01:34:54.421
and we were planning
the extraction,

01:34:54.423 --> 01:34:56.222
I went to him again.
Why?

01:34:56.224 --> 01:34:59.092
Because I was worried that
if we did have an informant,

01:34:59.094 --> 01:35:01.628
then the extraction
would also be compromised.

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:05.498
Colonel Harding assured me
that was the only one

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.100
that knew the exact details,

01:35:07.102 --> 01:35:09.903
and that he alone would
relay the information.

01:35:09.905 --> 01:35:12.605
I just spoke with Mercy.

01:35:12.607 --> 01:35:14.774
He said the Chechens
arrived at the extraction site

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:18.011
at the exact time he did.

01:35:18.013 --> 01:35:20.113
Kyle, it wasn't a coincidence.

01:35:20.115 --> 01:35:23.516
Look, these are photos
of the troops' movements.

01:35:23.518 --> 01:35:27.787
They were making
a bee line for Inferno,

01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:29.122
but then all of a sudden,

01:35:29.124 --> 01:35:30.890
for some reason,
they changed course,

01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:33.993
They went straight to
Martin and Mercy.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:37.297
And you think Harding told them?

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:42.268
I know that it sounds crazy.

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:46.339
I mean, God, I've known
this man my whole life.

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:49.409
It's just...

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:58.651
I think he blames the military
for misdiagnosing his son.

01:35:58.653 --> 01:36:01.521
Enough to commit treason?

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.625
I know how it sounds.

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:12.866
It's just, he was the only one
who knew the exact details...

01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:17.937
I'm going to input the cell, and
track it through the GPS.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:21.374
How do you do that?
Really? CIA spy stuff.

01:36:21.376 --> 01:36:24.377
I can check his texts,
read his emails...

01:36:24.379 --> 01:36:26.946
<i>even listen to his music</i>
<i>if I want to.</i>

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:28.648
Natalie?

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.484
You all right?

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:36.689
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:36:58.212 --> 01:36:59.813
Sergeant.

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:49.028
Now you have made
one hell of a mess.

01:37:52.466 --> 01:37:55.401
You shouldn't have gone and
got yourself captured, Victor.

01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:04.978
Can I see him?

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:12.852
Hey, what's going on?

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:16.456
Kyle?

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:26.766
It's not what you think, sergeant.

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:30.003
Your clearance only goes so high.

01:38:30.005 --> 01:38:31.704
I'm just following orders.

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:38.378
Come on now, Mercy.

01:38:57.932 --> 01:38:59.832
This is not what I wanted.

01:38:59.834 --> 01:39:01.834
For you or for the team.

01:39:12.246 --> 01:39:14.080
Drop the gun, Agent Black!

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:48.514
You look like shit.

01:39:48.516 --> 01:39:50.116
You're one to talk.

01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:55.355
I've met him before.

01:39:55.357 --> 01:39:57.557
He works for Martin's network.

01:39:57.559 --> 01:39:59.726
Why was he trying to kill you?

01:39:59.728 --> 01:40:03.997
Because I know
how to get to Martin.

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:09.168
My real name is Victor.

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:15.441
Mercy Callo.

01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:18.978
Of course that's your name.

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.913
You laugh it up.
Hey.

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:25.018
It suits you quite well.

01:40:33.661 --> 01:40:36.562
You're all set, sergeant.

01:40:36.564 --> 01:40:38.231
That's it?

01:40:38.233 --> 01:40:39.799
Is there anything I need to avoid?

01:40:39.801 --> 01:40:42.335
Getting shot.

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:53.312
Sergeant Callo.
Yes, sir.

01:40:53.314 --> 01:40:54.914
At ease, sergeant.

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:59.652
Have you given any thought
to what's next?

01:40:59.654 --> 01:41:02.321
No, sir.
I've never been given

01:41:02.323 --> 01:41:04.557
a choice of assignments
in the past.

01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:07.560
And what if that changed?

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:09.796
I've been asked
to put together a new team.

01:41:09.798 --> 01:41:11.397
I'd like you to be a part of it.

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:13.900
Doing what, sir?

01:41:13.902 --> 01:41:15.835
What you're good at.

01:41:15.837 --> 01:41:20.706
This life,
it's not for everyone, Mercy.

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:23.743
It wasn't for Natalie.

01:41:23.745 --> 01:41:25.778
It wasn't for my son.

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.580
They paid with their lives,

01:41:27.582 --> 01:41:29.462
and there's a good chance
you'll pay with yours.

01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:33.686
No one would blame you
for getting out now.

01:41:33.688 --> 01:41:36.422
I understand the risk, sir.

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:38.858
But there's something worse
than losing my life.

01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:40.526
What's that?

01:41:40.528 --> 01:41:43.763
Living with the knowledge
that I could've helped,

01:41:43.765 --> 01:41:45.398
but chose to get out.

01:41:49.903 --> 01:41:52.038
Then what are we waiting for?

01:41:53.305 --> 01:41:59.749
