I want you off my campus.
Go. You're fired.

34:12.853 --> 34:15.541
FRANK: Don't fucking tell me don't
do this. Get the fuck out of here.

You have ten minutes. Pack
your shit and get out.

Do you know what they're going
to do to us in the morning

35:40.832 --> 35:42.723
when they see that you're gone?

35:43.349 --> 35:49.075
That's if they don't pull a surprise
count. The next one's in four hours.

35:51.125 --> 35:52.660
BRAD: No.

35:56.148 --> 35:59.572
