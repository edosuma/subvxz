WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.705
( man panting )

00:17.651 --> 00:19.687
* *

00:48.149 --> 00:50.251
A most impressive showing, Ron.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.253
That was awfully, awfully fast.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.955
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.291
Any thoughts on
my pace calculations?

00:57.358 --> 00:59.293
There may be something in
the physics of "swing time."

00:59.360 --> 01:02.296
Airborne duration
during a running stride.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.631
-Yeah...
-There are new studies--

01:03.697 --> 01:05.399
into the time it takes
the nervous system

01:05.466 --> 01:07.101
to transmit contraction
instructions

01:07.168 --> 01:08.169
to the muscles: "twitch time."

01:08.236 --> 01:09.270
"Twitch time."

01:09.337 --> 01:11.405
The whole concept has me

01:11.472 --> 01:13.107
examining some interesting
algorithmic concepts.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.277
Undoubtedly, more interesting
when discussed over dinner.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.746
Do you care to join us
for an Okie Dog?

01:18.812 --> 01:20.414
As much as I hate to run...

01:20.481 --> 01:24.618
and run, but I... I've barely
got time to shower.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.521
I'm doing calibrations over at
the DNA lab most of the night.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.391
LARRY:
Uncharitable as it may sound,

01:30.458 --> 01:32.560
it pains me to share
your aptitude with genomes.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.563
See you tomorrow afternoon
at the LIGO lab, professor.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.431
-All right. See you.
-Professor.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.134
So you're having a sophomore
work at your precious

01:40.201 --> 01:41.902
Laser Interferometry lab, hmm?

01:41.969 --> 01:43.637
Some sophomore!

01:43.704 --> 01:47.141
His technical acumen with
complicated machinery--

01:47.208 --> 01:49.210
unprecedented
at the undergrad level.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.280
If he had a similar gift
at mathematics,

01:52.346 --> 01:55.516
I think we'd be looking
at the next Charles Eppes.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.397
( clanking, rattling )

02:22.843 --> 02:24.878
( grinding )

02:44.732 --> 02:46.300
( beep )

03:09.423 --> 03:12.426
( computer beeps )

03:23.937 --> 03:25.606
Go.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.026
We all use math every day,

03:46.093 --> 03:48.362
to predict weather,

03:48.429 --> 03:50.130
to tell time,

03:50.197 --> 03:52.733
to handle money.

03:54.635 --> 03:59.039
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.242
It's logic...

04:02.310 --> 04:04.345
it's rationality.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.979
It's using your mind

04:06.046 --> 04:08.549
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.225
I come in to calibrate
the synthesizer

04:18.292 --> 04:20.994
for the morning tests...
I walk in,

04:21.061 --> 04:24.765
I see two guys pushing it
down the hall, and I turn around

04:24.832 --> 04:26.434
and there's another
guy there with a gun,

04:26.500 --> 04:27.635
and he cold-cocks me.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.902
DAVID:
Was the weapon a shotgun,

04:28.969 --> 04:30.571
a handgun;
maybe it was a rifle?

04:30.638 --> 04:32.440
No, it was a nickel-plated
Beretta.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.041
It was a nine-millimeter.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.876
You know a lot about guns.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.579
You grow up in South Philly,
you see your share.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.449
Could you recognize the burglars
if you saw them again?

04:41.515 --> 04:43.250
The guy with the gun.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.052
The other two guys were
pretty far away.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.320
I'd definitely try.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.355
I'll be right back.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.522
Okay.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.330
So how is Ron?

04:56.397 --> 04:58.165
He won't be wearing a tight hat

04:58.231 --> 04:59.500
anytime soon, but he's fine.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.402
He was walking in,
the burglars were coming out

05:01.469 --> 05:03.971
and kind of walked
right over him.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.238
You guys know him?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.640
Yeah.
Ron works with us.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.609
He's one of Larry's assistants
at the LIGO project.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.143
LARRY:
Laser Interferometer

05:10.210 --> 05:12.480
Gravitational wave
Observatory.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.082
We measure ripples
in space-time,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.050
trying to prove the existence
of black holes...

05:17.117 --> 05:20.220
It's been said that he's the,
uh, the "next Charlie Eppes."

05:20.287 --> 05:21.755
AMITA:
What was stolen?

05:21.822 --> 05:25.426
It was a Mark Five
DNA Synthesizer.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.497
Is that serious?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.432
A DNA synthesizer
has many functions,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.401
most of them positive:

05:33.467 --> 05:35.536
genetic analysis,
anthropological study...

05:35.603 --> 05:37.771
But it's also used to sequence
microorganisms--

05:37.838 --> 05:41.008
invertebrate vectors of
infectious diseases--

05:41.074 --> 05:42.075
bacterial pathogens...

05:42.142 --> 05:43.444
Wait a minute, Charlie,
you're saying

05:43.511 --> 05:44.678
this thing
could make a disease?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.013
No, it can't really make them.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.549
But with the DNA and protein
sequence data it contains,

05:48.616 --> 05:51.318
it could... customize them.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.421
And by "customize," you mean...

05:53.487 --> 05:55.689
Weaponize.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.726
MEGAN: These burglars
cut through the roof.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.794
They came in through
the air ducts.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.965
What about these sensors?
Why didn't they trip?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.967
They're passive infrared
motion sensors.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.669
They're body temperature
sensitive.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.103
They used these to jam them

06:10.170 --> 06:11.705
with high and low
temperature signals

06:11.772 --> 06:14.475
at the same time--
it gave it a false read.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.876
So they had the place cased

06:15.943 --> 06:17.445
pretty well
ahead of time, right?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.112
Really well cased.
These floor bolts--

06:19.179 --> 06:23.584
they're only unlockable
by a biometric iris scanner.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.319
And there's no sign
of forced entry.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.320
Yeah, inside job.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.589
Looks like it.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.290
What exactly did they take?

06:30.357 --> 06:31.825
Mark Five DNA Synthesizer

06:31.892 --> 06:35.062
can be used to produce
a billion DNA copies

06:35.128 --> 06:36.464
in under three hours.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.898
We could have a serious

06:37.965 --> 06:39.967
national security problem
on our hands.

06:40.033 --> 06:40.968
Using this synthesizer

06:41.034 --> 06:43.103
to determine the sequences
of pathogens,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.739
those pathogens can
then be redesigned

06:45.806 --> 06:47.975
-for greater infectiousness.
-So conceivably,

06:48.041 --> 06:50.444
this thing could be used
to create a pandemic.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.812
Using a less sophisticated
synthesizer,

06:51.879 --> 06:53.914
a professor in New York
stitched together

06:53.981 --> 06:56.416
a polio virus genome,
which then spontaneously

06:56.484 --> 06:57.851
started making infectious
polio viruses.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.021
The thing can design bioweapons.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.956
There are a lot of rogue nations
out there

07:03.023 --> 07:05.025
that would like to get
their hands on that ability.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.660
COLBY:
So we're not just talking about

07:06.727 --> 07:08.496
high-end theft here, this could
potentially be espionage.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.863
Either way,

07:09.930 --> 07:12.032
we gotta find the thing before
it hits the black market.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.534
DON:
What'd you say about the

07:13.601 --> 07:15.168
biometric sensor?

07:15.235 --> 07:17.638
Only five iris scans can open
the security bolts.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.740
And all five professors
are ablibied.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.642
CHARLIE:
Actually, the biometric sesnsor

07:21.709 --> 07:24.144
doesn't read the iris.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.780
No, it reduces it to a series
of values, turning the iris

07:26.847 --> 07:29.016
into a constellation of sorts--

07:29.082 --> 07:32.152
a diagram of simple lines,
connected by unique points.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.756
And each point has a specific
value, based on its position--

07:35.823 --> 07:37.190
sort of like how stars
are measured

07:37.257 --> 07:39.993
by their relationship to one
another in the night sky.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.462
The values are represented by
a combination

07:42.530 --> 07:44.865
unique to the thumbprint,
and it is that number

07:44.932 --> 07:47.134
that the biometric sensor
compares to its database

07:47.200 --> 07:49.102
of allowed values.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.904
So then they just hack
the combination.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.706
But first they have to decode
the scanner's algorithm.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.843
Which they had to have
prior access to.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.678
And someone would have to have
the mathematical

07:57.745 --> 07:58.646
and the technical aptitude

07:58.712 --> 08:00.080
to run the algorithm.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.149
Someone like
Professor Charles Eppes.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.450
( wry laugh )

08:03.517 --> 08:05.052
Or maybe
"the next Charlie Eppes."

08:05.118 --> 08:06.987
That was a joke, David.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.022
I was making a joke
for Larry's benefit.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.090
Wh-what? What?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.825
The kid that walked in
on the burglars--

08:11.892 --> 08:14.728
he's supposed to be some kind
of technical whiz, right?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.130
And he has access
to that DNA lab.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.932
But the security cameras
give him an alibi.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.235
Only for the actual heist-- he
could've had something to do

08:22.302 --> 08:25.205
with it: the planning of it,
the setting up of it...

08:41.589 --> 08:43.056
"An Attempt to Find
a 70-Digit

08:43.123 --> 08:45.292
Narcissistic Number
in Base 12,

08:45.358 --> 08:47.494
by Charles Eppes."

08:47.561 --> 08:49.329
( laughing ):
Hey! Grade Two.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.566
Mm... I was quite...
quite, uh, quixotic...

08:52.633 --> 08:54.101
in elementary school.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.905
You know, my mother used to pack
all my old schoolwork in boxes,

08:57.971 --> 09:02.743
so I'm just, uh... taking a trip
down memory lane.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.178
Is it even remotely possible

09:05.245 --> 09:07.781
that our recent discussion
of the future

09:07.848 --> 09:09.449
has you retreating
into the past?

09:09.516 --> 09:14.021
I'm not retreating...
I'm simply reminiscing.

09:14.087 --> 09:18.525
Reliving old glories-- that can
be a dangerous narcotic.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.794
So I understand
the campus is abuzz

09:20.861 --> 09:23.864
about the, uh...
DNA lab burglary.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.233
You know, just color me
idealistic,

09:26.299 --> 09:29.536
but I find it inconceivable
that any student of science

09:29.603 --> 09:31.672
could sabotage
the efforts of so many

09:31.739 --> 09:33.540
for short-term monetary gain.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.777
Are there any suspects?

09:36.844 --> 09:39.046
They're talking
to a lot of people.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.648
Yeah?
Anybody in particular?

09:40.714 --> 09:43.516
You know that joke
I made to David--

09:43.583 --> 09:45.786
it might have, um...

09:45.853 --> 09:48.055
purely inadvertently...

09:48.121 --> 09:51.792
put some extra attention on,
uh... on Ron Allen.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.027
Oh, Charlie...

09:54.094 --> 09:57.030
Ron Allen has surmounted
incredible obstacles

09:57.097 --> 09:59.700
-just to get into Calsci...
-I know.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.168
Well, that you could erect

10:01.234 --> 10:03.103
one more barrier,
just out of some...

10:03.170 --> 10:06.039
-some careless remark?
-Larry.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.607
They're not singling him out.

10:07.675 --> 10:11.311
They're talking to everyone who
had access to that lab, okay?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.881
Okay.

10:18.686 --> 10:22.790
You know that if you were
to fall under similar scrutiny

10:22.856 --> 10:25.058
I would go beyond the boundaries

10:25.125 --> 10:27.460
of the observable universe
to defend you,

10:27.527 --> 10:29.663
and you know that.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.234
Huh.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.938
I always thought
your interests in... music

10:38.005 --> 10:40.373
were computational,
not compositional.

10:41.942 --> 10:45.312
What have you got here?

10:45.378 --> 10:48.148
I've never seen this.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.018
Don and I took piano lessons
when we were children, but...

10:54.654 --> 10:56.857
LARRY:
Hm, "Etude in G Minor"

10:56.924 --> 10:59.492
by-- who is that?--
Margaret Mann.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.696
Margaret Mann?
That's my mother's maiden name.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.865
She was a lawyer.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.767
LARRY:
Who apparently also composed

11:06.834 --> 11:09.169
an etude in G minor.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.843
Yeah, I figured you guys
would come back around to me.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.711
Why'd you think that?

11:17.778 --> 11:19.713
Poor kid from
the bad neighborhood.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.750
I been the usual suspect
since I was ten.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.951
Ron, we're not talking to you

11:24.017 --> 11:25.418
because you had a rough
childhood, okay?

11:25.485 --> 11:28.055
You're one of several people
with the technical expertise

11:28.121 --> 11:30.423
and unrestricted access
necessary

11:30.490 --> 11:31.725
to pull off this burglary.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.426
I'm not blaming you.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.897
( chuckles ): I'd suspect me,
too-- a guy who has to work

11:36.964 --> 11:38.465
four different jobs
just to stay ahead

11:38.531 --> 11:39.466
of his student housing bills?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.535
Fencing his synthesizer
for maybe $50,000, that'd...

11:42.602 --> 11:45.038
smooth off a lot of corners.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.341
You seem to have worked out
the math pretty thoroughly.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.643
Well, when you spend
your life with nothing,

11:50.710 --> 11:52.379
you know what everything costs.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.914
Look, I grew up

11:53.981 --> 11:56.183
in foster homes
and homeless shelters.

11:56.249 --> 12:00.053
I stole textbooks, and I taught
myself enough to get a GED.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.922
I'm too proud
of what I've accomplished

12:01.989 --> 12:06.293
to risk it all
for something so stupid.

12:06.359 --> 12:11.098
MEGAN: It's sort of
a persuasive argument.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.933
Didn't persuade me so much.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.635
-MEGAN: Why?
-I don't know.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.871
The way he brags
about growing up hard.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.841
Throws us some street slang
to try to sell it.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.043
You think someone
with that kind of history

12:23.110 --> 12:24.778
wouldn't talk about it so much?

12:24.845 --> 12:27.014
You work that hard
to polish yourself...

12:28.181 --> 12:30.417
...you want to put some distance
on it, too.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.231
Doug Windham?

12:49.036 --> 12:51.104
When are you guys
gonna stop hassling me?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.073
No hassle.
We just want to talk.

12:53.140 --> 12:57.144
His shoots a lot further
than yours.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.678
Sorry.

12:58.745 --> 13:03.083
Every time I see a badge,
I just want to hurt someone.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.018
Someplace private we could talk?

13:05.085 --> 13:06.987
It's not gonna be that long
a conversation.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.556
LAPD Burglary Detail
gave us a list

13:09.622 --> 13:11.825
of go-to guys
for high-end break-in tools.

13:11.892 --> 13:15.128
It just so happens your name
had a big fat star next to it.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.529
That's 'cause they're lazy.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.631
This shop has been straight
for five years,

13:18.698 --> 13:21.534
yet you guys are here hassling
me every time a safe goes down.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.536
And notice,
I'm still not in jail.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.738
So theoretically,
if we wanted to get by

13:25.805 --> 13:26.974
a passive infrared motion sensor

13:27.040 --> 13:29.910
and a biometric iris scanner...

13:29.977 --> 13:32.880
I.R. motion sensor
can get jammed

13:32.946 --> 13:34.514
with an oscillating heat pulse.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.750
Biometrics, I don't know,
they're after my time.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.386
Well, who picked up the torch?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.521
I don't know.
But when you guys find out,

13:41.588 --> 13:45.458
why don't you have the LAPD
put a big fat gold star

13:45.525 --> 13:47.327
next to his name.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.696
COLBY: Clearly this guy knows
more than he's saying.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.665
Why don't you do a phone dump on
his cell and the machine shop.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.567
You know, go back,
like, two or three months.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.270
Job like this got to take
a while to set up, right?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.171
Yeah, think so.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.706
Megan, how we doing
on the interviews?

13:59.772 --> 14:01.808
Uh, I'm more than halfway
through Calsci's list.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.611
What do you make
of this Ron Allen kid?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.279
MEGAN:
Well, his life story

14:06.346 --> 14:08.481
would make a hell of a movie.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.683
Uh, remake of The Wrong Man,
perhaps?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.619
The administration is asking me

14:12.685 --> 14:16.323
and other project managers
to suspend Ron from all lab work

14:16.389 --> 14:17.857
till your investigation
is completed.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.759
Well, that might be
a good idea, Larry.

14:19.826 --> 14:23.330
The theft of a DNA synthesizer
is not a simple one.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.864
In the hands
of a hostile government

14:24.932 --> 14:26.099
it could be used to create

14:26.166 --> 14:27.800
an avian flu virus--
this could be

14:27.867 --> 14:30.570
one of the worst WMD threats
our country has faced.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.872
Listen, I appreciate
the seriousness of this theft,

14:32.940 --> 14:35.108
but now to my knowledge,
you have no evidence

14:35.175 --> 14:37.110
that links Ron to this crime.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.480
Hey, Larry, this is an ongoing
investigation here.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.849
You are casting a black cloud
over a young man

14:42.916 --> 14:45.252
who's faced stupendous odds,

14:45.318 --> 14:48.355
a young man whose promise
at such a young age,

14:48.421 --> 14:50.523
-it's incalculable.
-A young man who isn't real.

14:50.590 --> 14:54.094
I did a deeper background check
into Ron Allen.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.931
Born in Philadelphia,
August 24, 1987.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.234
Died... November 21, '87.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.104
The kid you think Ron Allen is--

15:04.171 --> 15:06.273
Larry, he doesn't exist.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.048
There's no sign of him.

15:15.115 --> 15:18.018
Well, he had to know
it was just a matter of time

15:18.085 --> 15:19.652
till we figured out who he was.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.488
Yeah, well, which
we still don't know.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.156
What's the matter
with this room?

15:23.223 --> 15:25.558
Could use a vacuum cleaner.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.560
Other than that,
it's your typical

15:27.627 --> 15:29.329
college kid stuff.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.599
Yeah. Perfectly typical.

15:32.665 --> 15:33.900
But all over the map.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.303
There's hip-hop and heavy metal,

15:36.369 --> 15:38.671
and kung fu movies
and horror films.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.108
What were you into
sophomore year of college?

15:41.174 --> 15:43.410
Cheerleaders.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.577
And I was Kurosawa
and Coltrane.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.146
But if you look around
this room,

15:46.213 --> 15:48.448
there isn't one thing
that wasn't recorded,

15:48.515 --> 15:50.317
written or filmed
in the last two years.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.785
It's like he went out
and bought a bunch of magazines

15:52.852 --> 15:54.154
of what college students
were into

15:54.221 --> 15:55.455
and then bought everything

15:55.522 --> 15:57.424
-to make himself look typical.
-So he wasn't hiding

15:57.490 --> 15:59.626
just his identity
but also his personality.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.894
( phone ringing )

16:01.961 --> 16:04.097
Reeves.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.699
That's great. Thank you.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.469
All right, whoever Ron Allen is,
he paid his cell phone bill

16:09.536 --> 16:11.304
on time--
the GPS just tracked him

16:11.371 --> 16:14.507
to a bookstore on campus.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.346
None of the clerks
recognized his photo.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.149
I didn't see him hiding
in the stacks, either.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.052
Why don't we call him
and ask where he is?

16:25.118 --> 16:26.719
Yeah, why don't we?

16:28.721 --> 16:32.092
( dialing )

16:32.159 --> 16:33.926
( line ringing )

16:33.993 --> 16:35.528
( phone ringing )

16:38.398 --> 16:41.134
( ringing continues )

16:43.936 --> 16:45.172
Hello?

16:45.238 --> 16:47.174
Excuse me, Miss?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.408
Do you know this man?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.210
Oh, um...

16:50.277 --> 16:52.212
that's... Phil.

16:52.279 --> 16:55.215
-Phil?
-Phil Stark, my boyfriend.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.817
-Would that happen
to be his phone? -Uh...

16:57.884 --> 16:59.252
he said I could use it.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.321
-Who are you guys?
-FBI.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.356
Oh, my God,
he's not in trouble?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.924
We just want to talk to him.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.827
Well... I don't see
how you're gonna do that.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.062
Why not?

17:09.129 --> 17:10.263
He's in the desert.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.698
He left to go camping yesterday.

17:11.764 --> 17:12.732
Great.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.502
So we'll go search
the Mojave Desert.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.504
CHARLIE:
So is he Phil Stark

17:17.570 --> 17:19.572
or is he, you know, Ron Allen?

17:19.639 --> 17:21.741
Well, that's the thing--
he's Phil to his girlfriend,

17:21.808 --> 17:23.576
he's Ron Allen
to the people at Calsci,

17:23.643 --> 17:25.044
there's no fingerprints
on the guy anywhere.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.081
Well, at least you know
one place not to look for him.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.982
Yeah, well, we got a lot
of real estate to cover

17:30.049 --> 17:31.484
and not a lot of time.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.019
It's bad enough that
synthesizer's out there.

17:33.086 --> 17:33.953
We don't know
what the guy knows

17:34.020 --> 17:36.756
-or whose hands he's gonna
put it in. -You know,

17:36.823 --> 17:38.758
Larry's... devastated.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.127
Larry.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.128
ALAN:
Isn't it funny

17:41.194 --> 17:42.329
the people
who are closest to us,

17:42.395 --> 17:43.663
they always find it easy
to keep secrets.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.697
CHARLIE:
You know, it's interesting

17:44.764 --> 17:47.434
you say that,
because I don't recall

17:47.500 --> 17:52.038
you ever telling me
that Mom was

17:52.105 --> 17:53.406
a published composer.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.742
What-what... what is this?

17:55.808 --> 17:57.244
Where did you find this?

17:57.310 --> 17:58.111
I found it in the garage.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.012
-What, Mom?
-Yeah, see?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.781
Margaret Mann.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.416
Oh.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.286
ALAN:
Yeah.

18:06.353 --> 18:10.557
Your mother was
a very talented musician.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.160
She even had an offer
to study in Vienna.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.128
What are you talking about?
No way.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.697
-Mm.
-Oh, that's why

18:17.764 --> 18:19.932
all those piano lessons
with the-the nightmare woman...

18:19.999 --> 18:22.869
-Petri dish with the
lozenge breath. -Mrs. Petrie.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.172
You know, one time
she filed my fingernails for me.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.173
Wait, hold on.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.474
Why didn't she ever play?

18:27.540 --> 18:28.808
Did you ever see Mom
play that piano?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.910
ALAN:
Well, she had to make a choice

18:30.977 --> 18:32.312
between the law and music.

18:32.379 --> 18:35.014
And when she made the choice,
then...

18:35.081 --> 18:36.649
music was a closed issue.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.452
Except that it wasn't.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.324
These-these compositions
are dated

18:44.391 --> 18:45.492
through the '80s,

18:45.558 --> 18:47.360
through the '90s--
I mean, I think

18:47.427 --> 18:48.961
she was writing music
up until...

18:49.028 --> 18:50.330
You know?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.499
No, I didn't know.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.441
Hey, hey!

19:01.508 --> 19:04.010
Doug, careful with the TV!

19:04.076 --> 19:06.813
Your grandkids are gonna be
working for me for free!

19:06.879 --> 19:09.048
Come on!

19:09.115 --> 19:10.583
Gino McGinty.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.621
This guy's rap sheet's
just about as old as he is.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.990
Mostly receiving and possession
of stolen property,

19:18.057 --> 19:21.894
major ties to about a dozen
foreign black markets.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.763
Doug Windham's phone dump
had a bunch of calls

19:23.830 --> 19:25.398
back and forth with McGinty
before the burglary.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.567
There were about a half
a dozen after, too,

19:27.634 --> 19:29.902
including one 15 minutes
after we talked to him.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.305
For a guy not in
the burglary business anymore,

19:32.372 --> 19:34.374
he sure does keep
some shady company.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.942
I want to put together
a raid team,

19:36.008 --> 19:37.510
but Don doesn't want to risk
spooking anybody yet.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.845
Last thing we need
is that synthesizer

19:38.911 --> 19:40.480
leaving the country
before we can locate it.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.683
LARRY:
I went to bat for him.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.118
I stormed into
your brother's office,

19:46.185 --> 19:47.920
I put my own name on the line

19:47.987 --> 19:51.391
for...
I don't even know his name.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.125
I made a complete

19:53.192 --> 19:55.127
-fool of myself.
-Larry,

19:55.194 --> 19:57.063
your heart was
in the right place.

19:57.129 --> 20:00.400
Well-intentioned ignorance
is a slender defense at best.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.303
He was a complete
and utter fraud.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.272
Not a complete fraud.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.306
I mean, he certainly

20:06.373 --> 20:08.341
knew how to run
this equipment.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.646
And here I am,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.983
scrutinizing infinitesimal
ripples in the space-time

20:17.049 --> 20:19.552
of Einstein's
relativistic universe,

20:19.619 --> 20:23.523
when all the while, I can't
see this, this immense lie

20:23.590 --> 20:26.025
played out right before me.

20:26.092 --> 20:29.028
You are exactly right.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.564
Why is this not comforting me?

20:31.631 --> 20:34.467
LIGO doesn't see
cosmic events, does it?

20:34.534 --> 20:36.836
No, the events emit
gravitational waves

20:36.903 --> 20:39.105
which we measure
with lasers and mirrors.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.908
Which is how I'm checking
my own predictions

20:41.974 --> 20:43.743
on quantum corrections.

20:43.810 --> 20:44.744
Well, then.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.913
You didn't see Ron either.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.649
You saw the waves he created.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.723
You were unable to trace
Ron Allen's history

20:56.789 --> 20:59.492
because he was careful
to conceal his past.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.094
What he couldn't conceal,
however,

21:02.161 --> 21:04.096
was the impact of his past.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.532
I'm so hoping you have

21:05.598 --> 21:07.634
one of those cute little
analogies for this.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.070
As a matter of fact, I do.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.305
A person's journey through life

21:12.372 --> 21:15.708
is like a stone
skipping across water.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.278
No matter how briefly
it lands in one place,

21:19.346 --> 21:20.813
it leaves ripples behind,

21:20.880 --> 21:23.249
evidence
that it has been there.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.951
Now by studying those ripples,

21:25.017 --> 21:27.620
we can determine
the path of the stone.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.756
And with a little math
and a lot of luck,

21:29.822 --> 21:32.291
we can determine where
the stone began its journey.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.928
Ron Allen's ripples were his
facility at operating

21:35.995 --> 21:38.831
technically sophisticated
apparatus.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.501
Couldn't he have learned
to use these machines at CalSci?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.903
Any one of them, perhaps,
but to be able to operate

21:43.970 --> 21:46.773
these three different machines
with his skill level,

21:46.839 --> 21:48.475
well, that's like
teaching yourself

21:48.541 --> 21:50.810
how to fly a helicopter,
sail a yacht

21:50.877 --> 21:53.079
-and race a Formula One car.
-So he had to know how to use

21:53.145 --> 21:54.981
the same kind of equipment
before CalSci then.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.616
And I'm assuming

21:56.683 --> 21:58.885
the scientific community at this
level is pretty small, right?

21:58.951 --> 22:01.521
Somewhere in
the tens of thousands.

22:01.588 --> 22:05.392
But I refined my search
with a new set of ripples.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.660
Remember, track and field.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.696
Right, because
he ran long distance.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.431
Right, so I went through
research projects,

22:11.498 --> 22:13.533
filtered the names
of research assistants

22:13.600 --> 22:15.402
against college
track meet times,

22:15.468 --> 22:18.337
and I found these three.

22:18.405 --> 22:21.674
Although, I got to tell you,
there's probably more.

22:22.742 --> 22:23.643
University of Hawaii's

22:23.710 --> 22:27.414
2.2 Meter Telescope, 1996.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.551
Duke's Bioanalysis Group, 1999.

22:31.618 --> 22:35.488
And MIT's
Genome Research Team, 2001.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.924
He's like a chameleon.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.593
More like a snake,
shedding successive skins.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.429
Probably has
a new identity by now.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.464
And a new target.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.440
MEGAN:
University of Hawaii

22:53.506 --> 22:54.674
accepts Paul Combs,

22:54.741 --> 22:56.776
who says he grew up
on a Wyoming ranch.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.145
He's an unspectacular,
but a solid B-student

22:59.211 --> 23:00.547
with an interest in astronomy,

23:00.613 --> 23:02.649
microbiology and
competitive running,

23:02.715 --> 23:04.817
who disappeared in 1998

23:04.884 --> 23:06.986
with seven grand worth
of computer equipment.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.522
He surfaces again
as Henry Viera,

23:09.589 --> 23:11.724
a freshman at Duke in 1999.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.627
This time, he say he grew up
on an Alaskan fishing boat.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.163
Now he's a better student
and a faster runner.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.297
That makes sense.

23:18.364 --> 23:19.432
He knows the classes

23:19.499 --> 23:20.867
and runners improve
in their mid-20s.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.802
Yeah, only this time his
disappearance coincides

23:22.869 --> 23:26.405
with the theft of
a $15,000 electron microscope.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.574
Hmm.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.676
Then Allen Donaldson
gets into MIT

23:29.742 --> 23:31.478
in 2001.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.345
Introduces the "kid from
the street" story.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.615
He's got to be on his way to 30,
trying to pass for 18

23:35.682 --> 23:36.849
at this point.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.586
Star student, star runner,
and gone the next year

23:39.652 --> 23:41.353
along with something called
the Mass Spectrometer,

23:41.420 --> 23:44.190
worth upwards of $40,000.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.357
All right, so, what?

23:45.424 --> 23:48.360
He builds the identities of
a dead guy from another state?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.629
So he gets
the birth certificate,

23:49.696 --> 23:50.863
which gets him
a driver's license,

23:50.930 --> 23:52.198
Social Security card, all that.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.332
It fits our spy theory.

23:53.399 --> 23:54.501
MEGAN:
Actually, it doesn't.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.469
Because the stuff
he's stealing has value,

23:56.536 --> 23:57.770
but it's not sensitive enough

23:57.837 --> 23:59.171
for an agent to break cover.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.474
Okay, so he's just a thief.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.142
That doesn't really work either,

24:03.209 --> 24:04.443
because although he's
stealing bigger every time,

24:04.511 --> 24:05.778
there's just not
enough money there

24:05.845 --> 24:08.080
to justify the time
he spends as a student.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.081
DON:
Wait a minute.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.282
What if the thefts

24:10.349 --> 24:11.951
weren't an end, but a means?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.886
A means to what?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.354
You know,
like Groundhog Day, right?

24:15.421 --> 24:16.623
He gets to live the same life

24:16.689 --> 24:18.024
over and over again,
but each time better.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.359
Like a junkie stealing
just enough

24:20.426 --> 24:21.794
to get to his next fix.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.396
Only his high
is from the false celebrity

24:24.463 --> 24:26.733
he gets with every new persona.

24:26.799 --> 24:27.800
Yeah, but this thing,
the synthesizer's

24:27.867 --> 24:29.001
a much bigger deal than that.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.538
Because he needs a bigger
fix to get the same high.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.772
Right.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.507
We just got lucky
on the Gino McGinty wire tape.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.908
We got him on tape

24:35.975 --> 24:38.110
planning to move a major piece
of merchandise

24:38.177 --> 24:39.145
this afternoon.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.346
Good.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.882
( playing melody )

24:42.949 --> 24:45.451
You know, I don't believe
I've ever appreciated

24:45.518 --> 24:47.787
the resemblance to Pan before.

24:47.854 --> 24:48.821
( chuckles )

24:48.888 --> 24:50.289
The Pentatonic Scale.

24:50.356 --> 24:54.493
It's fascinating how a simple
set of fractions can come alive.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.629
What do we have here?

24:56.696 --> 24:57.797
Norwegian Willow Flute.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.099
The attendant one-dimensional
wave equation

25:00.166 --> 25:02.034
has mesmerizing
harmonic properties.

25:02.101 --> 25:02.835
( plays flute )

25:02.902 --> 25:05.872
It also makes
a very nice noise.

25:05.938 --> 25:09.876
Okay, uh, not to look a gift
horse in the mouth, Larry,

25:09.942 --> 25:12.579
but the, uh,
the emotional rebound

25:12.645 --> 25:14.681
is, uh, is bordering
on manic depressive.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.349
Look, I'm taking solace
in the fact that this man

25:17.416 --> 25:18.818
fooled everybody.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.220
So misery loves company.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.422
Well, it also loves bright,
new research assistants,

25:23.489 --> 25:24.924
and I actually interviewed

25:24.991 --> 25:27.093
a very promising
applicant just today.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.161
There's always another
young, brilliant student

25:29.228 --> 25:31.330
coming down the road,
isn't there?

25:31.397 --> 25:32.732
Yeah, sure.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.433
I mean, one would
hope so, right?

25:34.500 --> 25:35.835
Let me ask you something.

25:35.902 --> 25:39.806
Did you actually think that I

25:39.872 --> 25:41.641
was jealous of Ron Allen?

25:41.708 --> 25:44.711
( chuckles ):
Well, I mean...

25:44.777 --> 25:46.879
Yeah, maybe a scooch.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.616
I'll be honest with you.
You weren't exactly wrong.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.283
Not jealous of Ron--

25:51.350 --> 25:52.919
not specifically...

25:52.985 --> 25:53.986
But?

25:54.053 --> 25:57.523
Well, you know, when I was
a 13-year-old freshman,

25:57.590 --> 26:00.727
it wasn't much fun,
but it was cool.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.361
Everything I did

26:02.428 --> 26:05.331
was that much more impressive,
because of how young I was.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.699
And, you know, it was always,

26:06.766 --> 26:08.300
"If he's able
to accomplish that now,

26:08.367 --> 26:12.204
"can you imagine what amazing
things he'll accomplish

26:12.271 --> 26:13.640
when he's 25?"

26:13.706 --> 26:15.742
Now I'm 30 years old.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.409
Listen, listen.

26:17.476 --> 26:20.412
Paul Erdich published
more than 1500 papers.

26:20.479 --> 26:25.184
He died, literally,
at the chalkboard at age 83.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.285
Come on.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.721
You haven't seen your
best years yet, Charles.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.557
No, but...

26:31.624 --> 26:34.593
I'll never come
ahead of schedule again.

26:34.661 --> 26:37.363
Anyone interested in lunch?

26:37.429 --> 26:40.900
Hey, you know...
we never seem

26:40.967 --> 26:43.435
to throw away much from
this house, do we?

26:43.502 --> 26:46.072
You know, that was
the deal I made with Mom.

26:46.138 --> 26:50.009
She let me quit piano as long
as I never quit music entirely.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.778
So you started making
your own instruments.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.045
( chuckles )

26:53.112 --> 26:55.414
It was a very early sign that
parenting Charlie Eppes

26:55.481 --> 26:58.050
would present
some very unique challenges.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.920
You know, she must
have been so disappointed

27:00.987 --> 27:02.789
that Don and I didn't
like the piano.

27:02.855 --> 27:06.158
And I'm thinking that's
the reason that she kept

27:06.225 --> 27:08.494
her passion for the piano
hidden from us.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.330
No, Charlie, she didn't
keep it hidden from you guys.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.265
She kept it hidden from me.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.566
Why do you say that?

27:14.633 --> 27:17.036
You know how
your mother and I met?

27:17.103 --> 27:20.372
Sure, you were working
for a housing developer

27:20.439 --> 27:21.340
and she was an intern

27:21.407 --> 27:23.209
for a tenants rights
organization, right?

27:23.275 --> 27:26.012
Ooh, a latter day
Romeo and Juliet story.

27:26.078 --> 27:29.548
You see, um, we decided
that I would support her

27:29.615 --> 27:31.217
in her last year
of law school

27:31.283 --> 27:33.652
and she would support me
through graduate school.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.423
Then she told me
that music wasn't really

27:37.489 --> 27:39.692
a serious option for her.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.128
She was too much
in love with the law.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.768
Somehow I think I was a little
too eager to believe her.

27:48.835 --> 27:53.372
She just didn't want me to know
what a hard decision it was.

27:53.439 --> 27:59.211
That she gave up something
that she really loved.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.881
LARRY: For something
she loved more, Alan.

28:01.948 --> 28:05.217
You can't lose sight of that.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.788
Well... maybe.

28:10.656 --> 28:11.924
About time you guys got here.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.893
This thing's been burning
a hole in my warehouse.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.728
Get this thing on the truck.

28:15.795 --> 28:16.729
Come on!

28:16.796 --> 28:18.965
( sirens wailing )

28:19.031 --> 28:21.200
You got to be kidding me.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.303
Keep your hands there.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.237
Don't move. FBI.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.206
Against the truck.
Hands on your head.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.775
Let's go.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.245
Let me ask you something.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.647
Since when is selling
quality electronics

28:35.714 --> 28:37.116
at low prices a federal crime?

28:37.183 --> 28:41.754
Since you started selling
Mark V DNA synthesizers.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.690
So your buyer was Cuban.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.826
A Cuban national.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.160
Is that right?

28:48.227 --> 28:50.462
-That's right.
-To tell you the truth,

28:50.529 --> 28:52.031
I'm as shocked as you are.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.901
I got you selling
a bioterror weapon

28:54.967 --> 28:56.502
to an enemy state.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.037
-Bioterror?
-Yeah.

28:58.104 --> 29:01.640
Ah. And I thought
it was a photocopier.

29:01.707 --> 29:04.376
We got you.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.178
We got you on tape.

29:06.245 --> 29:11.083
Windham calling you and telling
you we were getting close.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.751
Never seen this kid
before in my life.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.021
You gonna waste
my time here, Gino?

29:15.087 --> 29:17.456
He tipped you off,

29:17.523 --> 29:19.525
only he'd never done
a job this big before

29:19.591 --> 29:21.060
so he needed your expertise.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.594
No, no-- I sell
electronics, okay?

29:22.661 --> 29:24.563
Yeah, sometimes I don't know
where they're coming from

29:24.630 --> 29:27.033
or where they're going,
but I don't steal.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.935
Fact-- you set him up
with a crew.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.470
Fact-- you sent him to Windham
to get the tools.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.772
So what are you talking to me?
Go talk to Windham.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.074
Well, selling tools
isn't a crime,

29:35.141 --> 29:36.943
but using them is,
and in this case

29:37.009 --> 29:38.177
it's a Federal rap-- treason.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.678
That's life in SuperMax.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.347
So you know that little mistake,

29:41.413 --> 29:43.449
that, that thing you've
been worried about doing

29:43.515 --> 29:45.117
for the last 15 years?

29:45.184 --> 29:48.387
Well, you made it.
You sure made it now, buddy.

29:55.027 --> 29:58.230
I paid Doug Windham,
50 Gs for the damn thing.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.366
I took it out
of his shop myself.

30:00.432 --> 30:03.502
So what, you're
telling me he stole it?

30:03.569 --> 30:06.072
All I know is Windham's
too greedy to help some kid

30:06.138 --> 30:08.107
set up a score
and settle for short money.

30:08.174 --> 30:12.078
Now, I can guarantee you,
he was his partner

30:12.144 --> 30:14.280
whether he liked that or not.

30:16.682 --> 30:19.585
-FBI!
-FBI!

30:19.651 --> 30:20.619
FBI! Let's go!

30:20.686 --> 30:22.188
Take the office.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.196
Hey, David.
Come take a look at this.

30:35.201 --> 30:39.171
( indistinct
radio transmission )

30:39.238 --> 30:40.139
David...

30:40.206 --> 30:42.408
Bullet to the chest,
no sign of a fight.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.411
Well, the techs just gave us
a fast fingerprint match

30:45.477 --> 30:47.880
to the ones we lifted
from Ron Allen's dorm room.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.648
I'm thinking maybe
Allen shows up

30:49.715 --> 30:50.983
looking for for his payoff,

30:51.050 --> 30:52.818
has some kind of beef
with Windham and wins.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.354
Now he's got maybe
50 grand disappearing money.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.555
Or maybe not.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.891
Foreman says they're missing
a portable plasma cutter.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.526
Burns through metal like butter.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.162
They use it to cut though vault
doors in case of emergencies.

31:03.229 --> 31:06.098
Sounds like our boy's
planning a bigger heist.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.405
So, there are four states of
matter-- solid liquid, gas,

31:13.472 --> 31:16.742
and, when you superheat gas...
plasma.

31:16.808 --> 31:17.843
Actually, you know what?

31:17.910 --> 31:19.145
There's five, if you consider

31:19.211 --> 31:20.279
Bose-Einstein condensates...

31:20.346 --> 31:23.149
Which we really don't need
to consider, right?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.917
( chuckling )
No, I guess not.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.886
A plasma cutter uses
an electrode circuit

31:27.954 --> 31:30.322
to spark a stream
of directed plasma--

31:30.389 --> 31:35.127
30,000 degrees Fahrenheit
at 20,000 feet per second.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.862
Now, this particular model can
cut ten inches...

31:36.929 --> 31:38.264
All right, all right.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.066
...of one-inch steel plate
in under a minute.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.667
Which means Ron Allen--
whoever he is--

31:41.733 --> 31:44.536
can walk through just about any
door he feels like.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.705
So, the question is,
what is the guy after?

31:46.772 --> 31:48.774
I think he's looking to do
something spectacular.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.676
Something to save
his jilted ego.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.278
I mean, he's being competing
against kids

31:52.344 --> 31:54.146
with less experience
for nine years.

31:54.213 --> 31:57.016
He knows that's all gonna come
out and he's gonna be held up

31:57.083 --> 31:59.418
-to ridicule.
-So, he's got to prove to us

31:59.485 --> 32:01.620
that he's not some loser,
that he's a genius.

32:01.687 --> 32:02.688
Oh, he's no genius.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.957
He's Wesley Shryer from the
suburb of Wheaton, Illinois.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.093
A cop from Wheaton PD recognized
him from one

32:07.159 --> 32:08.494
of the older photos we sent out.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.196
They went to high school
together.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.597
Cop says, and I quote,

32:11.663 --> 32:13.565
"He was average to the
point of forgettable."

32:13.632 --> 32:16.335
-( chuckles ) -Went to
community college for two years.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.571
Then he dropped off the face
of the Earth after '95.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.707
Whoever he is,
we better find him,

32:21.773 --> 32:23.709
before he steps up his game.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.211
LARRY:
Fraud or not,

32:25.277 --> 32:28.614
Ron worked on an impressive
breadth of research.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.350
Biochemistry, astrophysics,
genetics...

32:31.417 --> 32:34.353
Yeah, but doing the same thing
over and over again.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.256
Never challenging himself,
never reaching...

32:37.323 --> 32:40.259
I'm wondering if I see a little
of myself in Ron.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.360
You?!

32:41.427 --> 32:44.496
Well... listen, I can vouch for
your academic credentials,

32:44.563 --> 32:47.499
and to the best of my knowledge,
you're not homicidal.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.235
I'm talking about living
in a bubble.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.737
The safe, comfortable world
of academia.

32:51.803 --> 32:55.207
But Charlie, I don't know anyone
who challenges himself as

32:55.274 --> 32:56.275
relentlessly as you do.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.844
Yeah, and as far as living in
some academic bubble,

32:58.910 --> 32:59.945
I mean, look at us.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.513
We're out in this garage.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.749
We're trying to predict
a thief's next target

33:03.815 --> 33:06.885
by connecting experience
with-with potential targets.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.154
And we're not there yet.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.122
We need to find
a new approach,

33:10.189 --> 33:11.790
a, uh, a shortcut of some sort.

33:11.857 --> 33:16.195
Something like...
like Benford's Law.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.264
Benford's Law?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.766
That's a simple probability
observation.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.534
No, that's not all it is.

33:22.601 --> 33:28.407
If you take any table of
wide-ranging values--

33:28.474 --> 33:32.078
census data, test results,
land mass sizes--

33:32.144 --> 33:36.282
1 appears as the first digit in
more than 30% of the values.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.151
2 appears 17.6%.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.153
3 appears 12.5%.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.554
And so on...

33:42.621 --> 33:44.290
LARRY:
You know, the old story goes

33:44.356 --> 33:46.325
that Simon Newcomb discovered it

33:46.392 --> 33:50.129
by flipping through books
of logarithm tables.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.030
He discovered
that the earlier pages

33:52.098 --> 33:53.699
are more worn
than the later ones.

33:53.765 --> 33:56.402
Benford's Law is not about
conscious decision making.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.004
It is a statistical phenomenon.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.038
Precisely.

34:00.106 --> 34:02.007
Which is why
it's highly unlikely

34:02.074 --> 34:04.476
that Ron Allen spent...

34:04.543 --> 34:07.346
nine years working
at a specific theft?!

34:07.413 --> 34:08.814
I mean, after all, the most

34:08.880 --> 34:12.651
valuable machines today didn't
even exist nine years ago.

34:12.718 --> 34:13.819
That's right.

34:13.885 --> 34:18.157
Ron's knowledge base would pull
him more toward one target

34:18.224 --> 34:18.990
than another.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.594
So, he opens his book of
knowledge to a well-worn page

34:22.661 --> 34:24.196
where the spine
is already cracked.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.465
University of Hawaii's
telescope.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.567
He worked with cosmic
gravitation signatures.

34:28.634 --> 34:32.738
Which explains his familiarity
with LIGO's raison d'etre.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.806
At Duke, he worked with Beowulf
computer clusters...

34:34.873 --> 34:37.576
LIGO has a Beowulf Cluster.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.311
And with MIT's
genome project, he

34:39.378 --> 34:41.180
must have come in contact
with lasers...

34:41.247 --> 34:42.214
Lasers...

34:42.281 --> 34:44.483
-...photodetectors.
-Photodetectors...

34:44.550 --> 34:46.752
LIGO is the well-worn page.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.687
He's gonna rob
the LIGO lab.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.489
My LIGO lab?!

35:05.771 --> 35:08.174
All right, come on.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.600
You know, why don't you
let me go first, just in case?

35:34.666 --> 35:36.602
No, no, if he has already
been in here,

35:36.668 --> 35:38.237
I don't even know
if I want to live.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.071
Okay, the computers...

35:40.138 --> 35:42.007
they all seem to be here...

35:42.073 --> 35:43.409
and accounted for.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.477
Of course, the big-ticket
items... they're in here.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.646
All right, well,
why don't you open that up?

35:47.713 --> 35:49.348
( beep )

35:49.415 --> 35:52.484
Laser diodes alone are
worth $150,000 apiece.

35:52.551 --> 35:55.454
The sapphires, upwards
of half a million.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.356
That's a sapphire?

35:57.423 --> 35:58.490
Invaluable in optics.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.459
You know, bathysphere windows?
Those are sapphires.

36:00.526 --> 36:03.962
Now, those are fabricated,
but still intensely expensive.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.063
And where's the other one?

36:05.130 --> 36:07.132
Oh, it's down in the LIGO
tunnel with the laser.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.768
Okay, uh, so nothing's missing.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.970
No, it would appear
we got here first.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.705
That is, if he's coming.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.781
MEGAN:
Do you see that?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.616
Don, we've got
a suspicious vehicle

36:24.683 --> 36:26.618
parked in the middle
of the running track.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.455
Right, well, check it out,
and let me know what you see.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.992
What's that running track?
Like, a mile from here?

36:34.059 --> 36:36.395
Four kilometers, I would think.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.397
All right,
so they're not our guys.

36:38.464 --> 36:42.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The LIGO tunnel.

36:42.067 --> 36:42.734
What about it?

36:42.801 --> 36:44.603
Measurements are taken by
shooting lasers through

36:44.670 --> 36:47.072
an L-shaped vacuum pipe
with four-kilometer arms.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.941
Now, that thing runs directly
beneath the running track,

36:50.008 --> 36:51.943
and it bypasses
all of our alarm systems.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.845
You just said there's a sapphire
in the tunnel.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.881
All right, Megan,
that's our guys. Go, go, go!

36:57.215 --> 36:58.350
( beeps )

37:10.662 --> 37:12.764
( distant clatter )

37:25.344 --> 37:26.712
-FBI! -MEGAN: FBI!
Get down on the ground.

37:26.778 --> 37:27.979
-Let me see your hands.
-Get down!

37:32.150 --> 37:33.184
Get down.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.853
FBI!
Get down on your knees right...

37:37.489 --> 37:39.791
Get down on your knees.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.561
FBI! Get your hands up!

37:42.628 --> 37:44.696
Come on, I got him!

37:44.763 --> 37:45.897
Down! Get down!

37:51.537 --> 37:53.372
Put your hands behind your head.

37:57.443 --> 37:58.610
( grunts )

37:58.677 --> 38:01.046
Get your hands on your head.
Get your hands on your head!

38:01.112 --> 38:03.949
Face down, right now.

38:07.719 --> 38:11.823
I knew I couldn't keep
it going anymore.

38:12.991 --> 38:17.195
It got harder and harder
to pass for 18.

38:17.262 --> 38:18.930
The more places I worked,
the more

38:18.997 --> 38:22.133
I worried I'd run into
someone I knew.

38:22.200 --> 38:26.938
The scientific community
just isn't that big.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.508
The LIGO job was supposed to be
my retirement.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.842
So, why steal the synthesizer?

38:30.909 --> 38:33.779
You had to know that was going
to bring some attention to you.

38:33.845 --> 38:37.015
I needed the cash
to put the heist together.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.550
And I was still on schedule

38:38.617 --> 38:40.786
until you guys
tipped to Windham.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.789
And then Windham wanted a piece
of the LIGO job,

38:43.855 --> 38:44.790
so you shot him?

38:44.856 --> 38:49.361
Things got crazy,
but... it wasn't me.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.529
It was Jackson.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.864
Oh, yes, Ron.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.000
Blame the dead guy.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.768
It's the truth.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.604
You have to know how funny
that word sounds

38:58.670 --> 38:59.905
as it comes out of your mouth.

38:59.971 --> 39:03.509
You know, every one of those
schools turned down Wes Shryer--

39:03.575 --> 39:05.677
the B student from
the good high school.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.680
They weren't judging me
for my merit,

39:08.747 --> 39:11.249
for my ability,
for my potential.

39:11.316 --> 39:16.522
They penalized me for not having
some hard luck story.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.090
So, you penalized people
with real hard luck.

39:19.157 --> 39:23.194
All I did was level
the playing field.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.163
Get my fair shot.

39:25.230 --> 39:26.432
Fair?

39:26.498 --> 39:28.534
( chuckles )

39:28.600 --> 39:31.570
Spend 18 years dodging gangs...

39:31.637 --> 39:34.105
working to help support
your family...

39:34.172 --> 39:38.510
beating every odd out there just
to get your high school diploma.

39:39.545 --> 39:40.879
You do that

39:40.946 --> 39:44.650
and you can sit here and talk to
me about what's fair.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.590
Hello?

39:52.991 --> 39:54.526
Dad?

40:13.311 --> 40:15.614
( sounding out notes )

40:20.519 --> 40:22.053
Dad...

40:22.120 --> 40:23.054
I was thinking...

40:23.121 --> 40:25.957
That seems to be your
perpetual state, Charlie.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.093
...about Mom.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.097
Her music...

40:32.163 --> 40:33.164
Yeah...

40:33.231 --> 40:36.902
I've been thinking about
that a lot, too, Charlie.

40:36.968 --> 40:41.339
I went through guilt...
and anger...

40:41.406 --> 40:44.510
an irrational sense
of betrayal...

40:44.576 --> 40:46.645
that she hid this from me.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.747
Dad, I don't think she was
hiding it.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.949
Well, not in the way you mean.

40:51.016 --> 40:54.252
You know, I have places
that I'd like to go to be alone.

40:54.319 --> 40:56.855
I go hiking.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.156
You go fishing.

40:58.223 --> 41:01.927
Do you think your mother needed
to be alone with her music?

41:01.993 --> 41:04.496
It's just part of being human,
you know?

41:04.563 --> 41:07.999
To want to find... someplace

41:08.066 --> 41:09.701
solely for yourself.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.904
Whether it be outside
in the world

41:12.971 --> 41:14.740
or...

41:14.806 --> 41:18.910
deep inside your head.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.947
( piano melody plays
in distance )

41:29.454 --> 41:33.391
( strikes off-key chords )

41:33.458 --> 41:36.628
( playing poignant melody )

41:50.175 --> 41:52.510
* *
