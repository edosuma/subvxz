WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.235
RuPaul: Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

00:02.235 --> 00:05.138
You need to lead DragCon panels.

00:05.138 --> 00:07.174
You've got male...privilege.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.443
Speaking of ugly, do you
wanna meet our panelists?

00:09.443 --> 00:11.144
[all laugh]

00:11.144 --> 00:13.146
I knew about toxic masculini--

00:13.146 --> 00:16.083
toxic masculinity
at a very young age.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.618
Jasmine Kennedie.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.687
You were very charismatic,

00:20.687 --> 00:22.322
but I just didn't
get enough of you.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.957
Jorgeous.

00:23.957 --> 00:24.958
I felt like you
were self-conscious.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.560
Bosco.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.395
You were fucking hilarious.

00:28.395 --> 00:31.365
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.799
[cheers and applause]

00:32.799 --> 00:35.736
Jasmine, Jorgeous...

00:36.903 --> 00:38.472
Shantay you both stay.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.774
Yes!

00:40.774 --> 00:42.843
Oh, my God!

00:52.519 --> 00:54.554
[laughs]

00:54.554 --> 00:57.791
-Oh, bitch, we did it!
-Fuck, we did it, bitch!

00:57.791 --> 00:59.059
Oh, Miss Girl.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.261
Secretly, I think
we've all been wanting

01:01.261 --> 01:03.697
to see the Jasmine/Jorgeous
lip sync,

01:03.697 --> 01:07.334
and we definitely got the show
that we've been waiting for.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.803
But, uh, nobody was eliminated.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.439
And there still was eight.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.474
Don't put some glass
in my powder, now.

01:14.474 --> 01:18.812
Meow, let's give a shout-out
to that lip sync, though!

01:18.812 --> 01:22.182
Oh, my God!
[cheers and applause]

01:22.182 --> 01:24.618
That really did it for me.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.353
Like, we were screaming.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.687
Yeah, we were screaming.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.456
I honestly feel
so proud of myself.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.124
Jasmine was the one girl

01:31.124 --> 01:33.827
that I was, like, really kind
of nervous to lip sync against,

01:33.827 --> 01:36.196
because the bitch
could keep up with me.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.165
I'm just so happy to be here,

01:38.165 --> 01:39.866
because, girl,
I was nervous for a bit.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.936
I was gagging, too, because
I lip synced already twice.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.539
I was like, "She's not gonna
save me over Jorgeous right now.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.408
She's not gonna do that."

01:48.408 --> 01:51.812
Ugh. Am I irritated there's
eight of us here still?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.947
Absolutely. I get it.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.884
I can't be mad at it,
but I'm irritated. [laughs]

01:57.884 --> 01:59.186
Y'all bitches better beware

01:59.186 --> 02:01.488
if you're in the bottom
with us, okay?

02:01.488 --> 02:03.156
Whatever.
It wasn't that good.

02:06.226 --> 02:09.095
Girl, I know
all of them are mad,

02:09.095 --> 02:10.130
and you know what?
That's fine.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.466
Let those feelings bubble up.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.569
Let those feelings get to you
and really psych you out.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.737
Because if you're
lip syncing against me,

02:17.737 --> 02:20.740
it's gonna be very, very hard
to send me home, darling.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.009
Can we do this?

02:23.009 --> 02:25.579
Congratulations, Bosco!

02:25.579 --> 02:27.581
[cheering]

02:27.581 --> 02:30.350
That feels so fucking cute,

02:30.350 --> 02:33.386
and, like, definitely
a shout-out to Miss DeJa.

02:33.386 --> 02:34.387
[cheering]

02:34.387 --> 02:36.022
I surely did think

02:36.022 --> 02:38.792
that, like, maybe this
was the moment for you.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.061
I know you've been in the top
the past few weeks.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.662
-Yeah.
-Is it getting to you at all?

02:42.662 --> 02:45.899
It's, like,
you're right there.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.768
And just someone
just happened to do

02:48.768 --> 02:51.037
a teench bit kind of better.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.044
I'm not discrediting Bosco.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.646
She did amazing.

02:59.646 --> 03:02.349
But I feel like
I did everything right,

03:02.349 --> 03:04.317
and I feel like
I've listened to them

03:04.317 --> 03:08.522
and I've given them
what they wanted,

03:08.522 --> 03:10.624
and I still
couldn't get the win.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.626
If I'm doing amazing,

03:12.626 --> 03:15.729
like, why can't I
just get the win, you know?

03:15.729 --> 03:19.032
It really goes to show y'all

03:19.032 --> 03:23.203
that, like, this top eight
is top tier.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.638
The best of the best.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.573
We have just literally been
showing RuPaul and the judges

03:26.573 --> 03:29.409
we're just too good to go home.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.410
Honestly.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.845
And do you know what that means?

03:31.845 --> 03:32.846
Let's get the fuck
outta drag.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.047
Yeah, thank God.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.615
And you know what that means?

03:35.615 --> 03:37.384
We gotta listen to Jasmine
for one more week.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.920
Yeah, y'all gotta listen to me
for one more week!

03:39.920 --> 03:43.690
Drag Race is the living
personification

03:43.690 --> 03:46.960
of the saying "You're only as
good as your last performance."

03:46.960 --> 03:48.295
Ugh.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.830
And these girls are so good.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.900
I feel that Ru expects
the world from this group,

03:53.900 --> 03:56.536
because at this point we have
put the bar pretty high.

03:56.536 --> 03:59.639
And, like, to just deliver
isn't enough anymore.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.509
Aah! You have to, like,
transcend the challenge.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.810
Aah!

04:03.810 --> 04:05.345
And I am going to show
the judges

04:05.345 --> 04:06.880
why they brought me here,

04:06.880 --> 04:09.349
why I've been doing so well
in this competition...

04:10.617 --> 04:12.619
And I'm not gonna fuck it up.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.616
So it's a new day
in the werkroom,

04:42.616 --> 04:43.850
and no one's gone home.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.319
I wanted it
to be less competition,

04:46.319 --> 04:48.855
but here we are,
and that's okay.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.857
It just means we've gotta
keep fighting harder.

04:50.857 --> 04:51.992
I feel like
I have the most to prove

04:51.992 --> 04:53.393
because I've been
in the bottom the most.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.463
So, like, I have nothing to do
other than, like, succeed.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.231
So, like, I definitely
have to be on my A game,

04:58.231 --> 04:59.299
because, like,
when my shoe fell off

04:59.299 --> 05:01.267
and the lip sync--
[alarm]

05:01.267 --> 05:02.769
Thank you. Cut me off!

05:02.769 --> 05:04.537
RuPaul: Ooh, girl!

05:04.537 --> 05:06.940
She done already
done had herses!

05:06.940 --> 05:08.975
Thanks to Jasmine.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.277
Now, I don't mean
to get precious,

05:11.277 --> 05:15.115
but you better be prepared
to share your flavor,

05:15.115 --> 05:17.717
because, oops,
we're doing it again.

05:17.717 --> 05:21.221
And, yes, this bitch
is recording.

05:21.221 --> 05:24.057
Whoo-hoo. Shut up!

05:25.291 --> 05:26.960
What does that mean?

05:28.094 --> 05:29.195
Hello, hello, hello!

05:29.195 --> 05:32.198
-Hi.
-Oh, yes!

05:32.198 --> 05:34.834
Come on, 24-karat!

05:34.834 --> 05:36.036
Ladykins.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.337
-Hey!
-Yeah!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.606
Well, you know, America's
next drag superstar

05:39.606 --> 05:42.876
needs to pop no matter
what she's wearing.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.345
So for today's mini-challenge,

05:45.345 --> 05:48.815
you need to create
wearable pop art

05:48.815 --> 05:51.985
using nothing but bubble wrap.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.853
[all laugh]

05:53.853 --> 05:55.321
Now, to get your
creative juices flowing,

05:55.321 --> 05:57.891
feel free to use bubble wrap

05:57.891 --> 06:01.828
inspired by Bubly
sparkling water flavors.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.862
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

06:02.862 --> 06:05.632
Like coconut-pineapple

06:05.632 --> 06:06.800
and blackberry.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.168
-Hey!
-[laughs]

06:08.168 --> 06:11.171
Queens, you have 30 minutes
to get into quick drag

06:11.171 --> 06:15.809
before you walk
the red bubble-wrap carpet.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.044
Ready, set, go!

06:18.044 --> 06:19.446
Yes!

06:22.015 --> 06:24.551
[crackling and popping]

06:24.551 --> 06:27.887
This is, like, the most hellish
ASMR you've ever heard of.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.389
[popping]

06:29.389 --> 06:32.992
Of just duct tape
and bubble popping

06:32.992 --> 06:34.294
filling the room.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.231
Whoo, crack a smile,

06:38.231 --> 06:40.467
'cause the pop-arazzi
is comin' for ya.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.305
First up, Jorgeous.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.840
Fancy meeting you here.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.176
Oh, yes, the bubbles
have arrived.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.913
In addition to having
a sparkling personality,

06:53.913 --> 06:55.782
she's so-fizz-ticated.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.151
She makes it pop. [pop]

06:58.151 --> 06:59.753
Ooh, she's poppin'!

06:59.753 --> 07:01.921
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

07:01.921 --> 07:03.123
You got it poppin', girl.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.025
[tongue pops]

07:06.025 --> 07:08.428
Ooh, papi chulo!

07:08.428 --> 07:10.196
Close your eyes
and think of England.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.031
It's Lady Camden.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.801
[British accent]
She's a proper lady.

07:14.801 --> 07:18.705
Yes, look at you, looking
like Camilla Parker Bowles.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.407
Her fashion inspirations
are Versace

07:21.407 --> 07:23.443
and your dad's fat ass.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.945
Let me see it, girl.
Ooh, yes, child.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.982
That's bangers and mash
up in this bitch.

07:28.982 --> 07:33.553
Now poppin' down
the red carpet, it is Angeria.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.389
She's serving the kabuki finale.

07:36.389 --> 07:40.326
Come on, Angeria!

07:40.326 --> 07:42.862
We got a bad case of Angeria.

07:42.862 --> 07:45.198
Oh, look at y'all
lookin' like Exposé.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.566
You know who Exposé is?

07:46.566 --> 07:47.934
No. No, I ain't got--

07:47.934 --> 07:49.936
I need to fucking retire.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.204
[all laugh]

07:51.204 --> 07:52.839
Because they don't know shit

07:52.839 --> 07:54.707
about what I'm talking about.

07:54.707 --> 07:59.078
Up next, Willow Pill enjoys
long walks on the freeway

07:59.078 --> 08:01.381
and coffee enemas.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.450
Oh, pop, pop.
Oh, she poppin'. She poppin'.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.986
Can you make
your pussy pop? Yes!

08:06.986 --> 08:09.389
Once this queen pops,
she cannot stop.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.224
Here's Daya Betty.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.126
Daya Betty's inspiration
for tonight

08:13.126 --> 08:15.395
are depression and anxiety.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.130
Bitch, Miss Daya Betty,

08:17.130 --> 08:20.133
she's giving me
Rugrat baby the house down.

08:20.133 --> 08:24.304
I always say that
all fashion sins are forgiven

08:24.304 --> 08:26.940
with a side ponytail.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.075
It's DeJa Skye,

08:29.075 --> 08:31.911
but the pop-arazzi
call her Thunderella.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.714
Oh, she's doing the worm,
she's gonna do the snake.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.816
Oh, she's poppin' off.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.552
Now, DeJa Skye
is releasing her new single,

08:39.552 --> 08:41.754
Pop It Like
It's Room Temperature.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.690
[pop, all laugh]

08:43.690 --> 08:45.425
Something in the milk
ain't clean.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.261
It's Bosco!

08:48.261 --> 08:50.196
Yes, she's rock and roll.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.266
Bosco is giving me Aquaria
Season 10 entrance look.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.168
I mean, obviously
not quite as nice.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.370
It's a little like
Aquaria's entrance look

08:57.370 --> 09:00.306
if it's been in the tumble dryer
a few too many times.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.374
[laughs]

09:01.374 --> 09:04.344
She poppin',
cherry pop, cherry pop.

09:04.344 --> 09:08.281
Okay, who wanna sip
a little bit of this cherry pop?

09:08.281 --> 09:13.286
Put your hands together
for Jasmine Kennedie.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.755
Yes, look. Jiggle them titties,
jiggle them tits.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.191
Hey, shake them. Oh!

09:18.191 --> 09:19.926
Oh, yeah, pop them titties!

09:19.926 --> 09:22.195
Yeah, pop it, pop it,
pop it, pop it!

09:22.195 --> 09:25.265
Yes, pop it.
Don't wear yourself out.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.734
[all laugh]

09:27.734 --> 09:31.704
You're poppin' it off, mama!

09:31.704 --> 09:34.407
Ladies!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.943
Now, you all popped
in different flavors,

09:36.943 --> 09:39.812
but one of you really got loud.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.648
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...

09:43.416 --> 09:45.118
[whispers] Bosco.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.886

09:46.886 --> 09:50.490
Con-drag-ulations.
You've won $2.500

09:50.490 --> 09:53.593
courtesy of Bubly
sparkling water.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.061
Thank you.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.096
Ladies, now that
you've worked the red carpet,

09:57.096 --> 09:58.932
it's time for the main event.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.467
Hold on to your edges,

10:01.467 --> 10:03.002
because we're playing
the Snatch Game!

10:03.002 --> 10:05.738
[cheering]

10:05.738 --> 10:08.207
Oh, my God.
Okay, it's here.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.678
The Snatch Game has arrived.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.380
You choose a celebrity
to impersonate,

10:14.380 --> 10:16.950
and you make us laugh out loud.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.252
I mean, what could go wrong?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.820
[all laugh]

10:20.820 --> 10:22.689
This is the challenge
of Drag Race.

10:22.689 --> 10:23.990
It is the challenge

10:23.990 --> 10:25.959
that shows who's gonna be
in the top of the season

10:25.959 --> 10:28.394
and who's not really
gonna make it too far.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.363
And if you're
not prepared for it,

10:30.363 --> 10:31.898
bitch, you better know
your lip sync song.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.802
All right, bitches,
Snatch Game!

10:35.802 --> 10:36.803
Snatchy-snatch!

10:36.803 --> 10:38.705
We made it to Snatch Game!

10:38.705 --> 10:40.707
[whispers] It's here.

10:40.707 --> 10:44.410
The moment, the peril,
the existential death.

10:44.410 --> 10:49.215
Today's maxi-challenge
is the Snatch Game.

10:49.215 --> 10:53.786
Celebrity illusion is a really
important part of drag history.

10:53.786 --> 10:57.056
It was the most popular type
of drag for a really long time,

10:57.056 --> 11:01.361
and it's still such
a cool skill set to have.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.096
Your collar is so sickening.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.598
You're doing Prince?

11:05.598 --> 11:07.333
Prince?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.102
-No?
-Prince?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.770
You're doing queen something?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.438
No, William Shakespeare.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.207
-You're doing--oh.
-The writer.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.410
Willow.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.711
Yes, ma'am.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.481
How are you feeling
about the Snatch Game?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.516
I think I'm gonna do
Drew Barrymore.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.018
I love that.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.220
She's, like, one
of my favorite actors ever.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.589
I feel like this is
a really good choice,

11:29.589 --> 11:31.324
because she's well known,

11:31.324 --> 11:33.626
she's funny,
and everyone loves her.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.395
So I feel like
this is gonna to pretty well.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.530
I'm gonna sell Gwyneth Paltrow.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.667
I have a plan for Snatch Game,
and I like my plan.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.736
It's, like, less
about her as an actress

11:43.736 --> 11:48.508
and more about her as, like,
a New-Age snake oil salesman.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.610
Like, have you ever been
to her website?

11:50.610 --> 11:53.012
No, but I know people
make fun of her all the time.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.848
It is in-fucking-sane.

11:55.848 --> 11:59.519
Like, there are candles
scented like her vagina

11:59.519 --> 12:01.721
that she sells for $75.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.358
Bosco and Willow
always surprise us,

12:05.358 --> 12:06.592
so I'm definitely thinking

12:06.592 --> 12:09.796
the girls are gonna turn it out
some kind of way.

12:11.964 --> 12:14.834
Hey, ladykins.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.136
[cheering]

12:17.136 --> 12:19.839
I'm here to examine
your snatches.

12:19.839 --> 12:23.709
[all laugh]

12:23.709 --> 12:25.378
Oh, Jorgeous!

12:25.378 --> 12:26.579
Hello-teous!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.281
Now, I see some cut-off shorts,

12:28.281 --> 12:30.216
-I see a little halter top.
-Yes.

12:30.216 --> 12:32.418
-Are you Gallagher?
-No.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.921
You worked with her on a little
show called Broad City.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.456
I'm doing Ilana Glazer.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.591
Oh, my goodness.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.327
I watch her show
Broad City all the time.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.728
I love that show.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.730
Like, this is the character
I feel really confident in.

12:44.730 --> 12:45.731
Oh, good.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.800
Who were your other choices?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.502
Selena and Aubrey Plaza.

12:49.502 --> 12:53.005
Oh, can I hear a little bit
of your Aubrey Plaza?

12:53.005 --> 12:54.207
Oh, my God.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.109
So, Aubrey, what did you
have for breakfast?

12:56.109 --> 12:59.011
Oh, my God.
Girl, Miss Mama Ru,

12:59.011 --> 13:00.446
don't put me
on the spot like that.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.014
[laughs]

13:02.014 --> 13:03.916
That's all right,
that's all right.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.451
Now, Jorgeous,
I've been talking to you

13:05.451 --> 13:08.454
for weeks and weeks and weeks,
and my heart goes out to you,

13:08.454 --> 13:09.689
because I can feel

13:09.689 --> 13:12.258
underneath all that bravado
thing that you do,

13:12.258 --> 13:13.826
you're an innocent child,

13:13.826 --> 13:16.796
and your emotions are
right there under the surface.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.998
Honestly, I've been trying
to get it together,

13:18.998 --> 13:20.967
because, like, when
I was doing the lip sync--

13:20.967 --> 13:22.602
-Last week?
-Last week, yes.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.736
I was just in it.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.571
I've been really trying
to figure out, like,

13:25.571 --> 13:28.474
how I'm gonna bring
that energy to this,

13:28.474 --> 13:31.210
you know, because
I really wanna make you proud.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.512
You know what it is.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.548
Don't see yourself
from outside of yourself.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.517
See yourself
from inside of yourself.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.751
Because when you go outside
of yourself,

13:38.751 --> 13:40.219
you're not in the moment,
you know?

13:40.219 --> 13:42.855
Yes, and I definitely think
I do that a lot.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.357
Well, I cannot wait to see it.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.458
I'm a big Broad City fan.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.626
Yes! Yes.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.195
-Just have fun.
-I will. I got you.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.663
All right.
Thank you, Jorgeous.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.064
Thank you, Ru!

13:52.064 --> 13:55.301
Daya Betty! [laughs]

13:55.301 --> 13:57.236
The glasses really give it away.

13:57.236 --> 13:58.437
Uh-huh.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.439
-That's Ozzy Osbourne.
-It is Ozzy Osbourne.

14:00.439 --> 14:03.109
Do you know,
he's a lovely, lovely man?

14:03.109 --> 14:06.045
He's a sweetheart,
and he loves this show.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.446
Are you gonna embarrass him?

14:07.446 --> 14:11.184
I hope not, but I'm
a little nervous about this.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.185
All right, why?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.653
I don't consider myself

14:13.653 --> 14:17.290
a celebrity impersonator
whatsoever.

14:17.290 --> 14:21.694
Ozzy has this personality where
he stumbles over his words,

14:21.694 --> 14:22.762
sometimes people are like,

14:22.762 --> 14:23.996
"What the hell
are you even saying."

14:23.996 --> 14:25.565
And so I'm hoping

14:25.565 --> 14:27.567
that if you can tell
I'm a little uncomfortable,

14:27.567 --> 14:30.203
it still kind of fits
the character.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.437
You know, you don't
have to get nervous.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.005
-You have a choice.
-Yeah.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.375
And most people think that
that will propel them forward

14:36.375 --> 14:40.346
until it doesn't
propel you forward anymore.

14:40.346 --> 14:43.816
Now, if you love Ozzy,
you will get Ozzy.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.418
Throughout this competition,

14:45.418 --> 14:50.756
people have said that you are
very much like Crystal Methyd.

14:50.756 --> 14:51.857
Yeah.

14:51.857 --> 14:55.528
The reason you pick up
her mannerism

14:55.528 --> 14:57.230
is because you love her.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.464
Yeah, she's my family, so--

14:58.464 --> 15:01.234
Now, whatever you've done
with Crystal Methyd,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.970
do that with
fucking Ozzy Osbourne.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.304
-Okay.
-All right.

15:05.304 --> 15:08.207
Well, I will see you
on the Snatch Game panel.

15:08.207 --> 15:09.208
-All right, I'll be there.
-Okay.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.310
-Thanks, Ru.
-[laughs]

15:11.310 --> 15:14.247
Y'all get ready for Angeria.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.582
Ooh, fix me a plate, Angeria.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.884
-Yes, henny.
-Yes, henny.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.153
All right, so that wig
is throwing me off.

15:21.153 --> 15:23.289
I am doing Tammie Brown.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.690
-Tammie Brown?
-Yes.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.425
The girl who's been
on this show?

15:26.425 --> 15:27.526
That has been on this show.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.829
Oh, my goodness,
Tammie Brown.

15:29.829 --> 15:33.566
For all of you young drag babies
watching Drag Race

15:33.566 --> 15:35.301
who may not know
who Tammie Brown is...

15:35.301 --> 15:36.802
I don't see you out there
walking children in nature.

15:36.802 --> 15:40.306
Tammie Brown is the real
essence of the kookiness.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.707
I'm so excited about it.

15:41.707 --> 15:44.777
Yes. What's your favorite
Tammie Brownism?

15:46.212 --> 15:49.815
Uh-huh. [laughs]

15:52.218 --> 15:55.221
That's a great idea
if you can pull it off.

15:55.221 --> 15:58.057
So early on,
you won two challenges.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.825
-You haven't won any since.
-No.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.727
I have been trying
really, really hard,

16:01.727 --> 16:04.297
and I get, like,
right to the edge sometimes,

16:04.297 --> 16:06.666
and it's like, eh, not quite.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.536
Listen, luxuriate
in Tammie Brown.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.738
I don't think anyone's
ever said those words before,

16:12.738 --> 16:15.207
but I want you to do that.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.575
All right, well,
thank you so much.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.010
Thank you, Mama.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.011
[laughs]

16:19.011 --> 16:20.346
All right, girl.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.947
Yes, I'm Tammie Brown,

16:21.947 --> 16:24.050
and I'm spinnin' your head
around and around.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.085
Ooh, yeah.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.486
Jasmine Kennedie.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.488
Hellur!

16:29.488 --> 16:31.123
-Hi, lady.
-Hi, Mama Ru.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.591
So last week they were saying,

16:32.591 --> 16:34.994
"Ooh, she comin' out
as a 40-year-old woman."

16:34.994 --> 16:37.897
Yes, and I'm gonna be coming out
as a 50-year-old woman today.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.132
[laughs]
Are you Joan Rivers?

16:40.132 --> 16:41.200
I'm not.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.270
I'm actually going
to be Betsy DeVos.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.838
Oh, my gosh.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.506
Uh-huh. Yeah.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.643
Betsy DeVos
is the former secretary

16:50.643 --> 16:51.977
of the Department of Education

16:51.977 --> 16:55.214
under the "they shall not
be named" administration.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.217
And she is
a plain old wretched hag

16:58.217 --> 17:00.653
who knows nothing
about education.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.755
Now, no one's ever come
for Betsy DeVos before.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.156
No, and I will,

17:04.156 --> 17:06.659
because listen, if it's
the truth, it ain't defamation.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.760
Yes, that's right.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.128
And, you know, you're in luck,

17:09.128 --> 17:11.097
because no one knows
what she acts like.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.199
You have carte blanche
to act however you wanna act.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.533
Exactly, yeah.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.335
Who are you actually going
to be channeling in this,

17:16.335 --> 17:20.272
your mom, your grandmom,
Satan?

17:20.272 --> 17:21.607
Kind of like
a conglomeration

17:21.607 --> 17:24.243
of, like, a super
evangelical, like, woman

17:24.243 --> 17:27.613
mixed with Kellyanne Conway,
if that makes sense.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.382
It doesn't make sense,
but let me tell you this.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.784
When you're doing these
improv things like this,

17:31.784 --> 17:33.386
it's about behavior.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.520
I'm definitely
adding an accent to it,

17:34.520 --> 17:35.988
but I'll leave it
for your surprise,

17:35.988 --> 17:38.457
because I think it's gonna be
kind of like my Southern accent,

17:38.457 --> 17:40.993
where it does not fit,
but it's gonna be there.

17:40.993 --> 17:41.994
[laughs]

17:41.994 --> 17:43.896
[southern accent] Maxine!

17:43.896 --> 17:45.865
-Now, that was funny.
-Yeah.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.833
Because it was so bad,
it was good.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.502
And you lip synced
for your life last week,

17:49.502 --> 17:51.003
and you did not get sent home.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.171
Thank you, thank you.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.973
No, that's all you, babe.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.075
Third time, and, you know,
I'm feeling good.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.510
It didn't freak me out.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.478
I was just more,
like, nervous that, like,

17:59.478 --> 18:00.579
I didn't really get to do

18:00.579 --> 18:02.548
something I wanted to do,
like this.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.584
Like, the fact that
this is this week's episode

18:05.584 --> 18:07.019
just gives me more confidence

18:07.019 --> 18:09.221
in the fact that
you saved me for a reason.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.890
Uh-huh.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.359
Eye roll, eye roll.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.127
Eyes rolling
in the back of my head.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.530
Jasmine's been in the bottom
three times now.

18:17.530 --> 18:22.401
I have yet to see anything that
Jasmine can do fantastically,

18:22.401 --> 18:25.671
other than lip syncing
when she's in the bottom.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.606
All right, well, go get ready.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.607
I can't wait to see you
in Snatch Game.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.377
Thank you.
Yes, I'll see you soon.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.979
Coo-coo!
[both laugh]

18:37.616 --> 18:39.351
All right, DeJa Skye.

18:39.351 --> 18:40.886
-Hello, DeJa.
-Hellur!

18:40.886 --> 18:42.988
-Now, I see a hip-hop hat.
-Uh-huh.

18:42.988 --> 18:44.023
-Dreads.
-Uh-huh.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.592
-And a varsity jacket.
-Yes.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.693
I have no idea who that is.

18:47.693 --> 18:48.928
Lil Jon.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.964
-Lil--oh!
-Yes. [laughs]

18:51.964 --> 18:54.433
You are so stupid.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.568
[laughs]

18:55.568 --> 18:57.803
Lil Jon is a rapper
from the ATL.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.639
He's known for his absurdisms,

19:00.639 --> 19:03.709
and Lil Jon
is completely up my alley.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.811
-I love Lil Jon.
-I do, too.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.080
Have you done Lil Jon before?

19:08.080 --> 19:12.051
No, but I constantly just say
"yay-ya!" all the time, so...

19:12.051 --> 19:13.552
That's a great idea.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.955
You know, if you can pull it
off, it's gonna be really good.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.122
Fingers crossed.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.424
Yeah. Who were
your other choices?

19:18.424 --> 19:19.992
I had Abby Lee Miller.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.229
Yeah, that works, too,
but I do love Lil Jon.

19:23.229 --> 19:26.432
Now, does Lil Jon
have other isms

19:26.432 --> 19:27.967
that we would know
that are funny,

19:27.967 --> 19:29.235
or are you gonna make some up?

19:29.235 --> 19:30.903
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna make some up,

19:30.903 --> 19:32.371
because essentially,
you just wanna laugh.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.873
Yeah, I wanna laugh.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.108
Now, you almost won last week.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.176
-I did!
-You came very close.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.111
-So it's Snatch Game.
-Yes.

19:39.111 --> 19:42.481
This is an opportunity
for you to snatch a win.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.816
Never done
an impersonation before.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.150
Even when I perform or anything,

19:45.150 --> 19:46.619
I always just do DeJa.
I don't do--

19:46.619 --> 19:48.254
Listen, that's all
you need to know.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.789
Find out what your
frequency is and do that.

19:50.789 --> 19:52.258
-Apply it to everything.
-Right.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.327
You know, you did it last week
in the DragCon panel.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.328
Right.

19:56.328 --> 19:57.830
Apply that to Lil Jon.

19:57.830 --> 19:58.998
Okay, I absolutely will.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.499
All right, I can't wait
to meet Lil Jon.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.102
Thank you, Ru.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.603
I'm the Susan Lucci,

20:04.603 --> 20:08.040
because I get this close
and never fucking win.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.743
But that win I need.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.646
-Yay-ya!
-[laughs]

20:13.646 --> 20:15.147
-Lady Camden.
-Hi!

20:15.147 --> 20:17.650
Now, I see a wig.
Who are you doing?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.552
I'm gonna do
William Shakespeare.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.488
-Oh, William Shakespeare.
-Yes.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.856
Are you a big fan?

20:23.856 --> 20:25.524
Not particularly,
but I do feel

20:25.524 --> 20:27.192
like it might be
kind of a fun way

20:27.192 --> 20:29.128
to just make fun of who I am,
because I feel like

20:29.128 --> 20:32.531
I can be very posh
and refined and whatever.

20:32.531 --> 20:35.701
So I kind of wanna try
to use that.

20:35.701 --> 20:36.969
I think it's a good idea.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.939
And of course, make up
as much stuff as you can.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.541
-Yeah.
-Because we all know who he is,

20:42.541 --> 20:44.143
but we don't know
what he act like.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.811
So you have free rein.

20:45.811 --> 20:46.979
Who were your back-ups?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.981
I love to do
a bit of Joanna Lumley.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.016
I love a little bit
of, you know, cheeky,

20:51.016 --> 20:52.918
a little bubbly,
a little party.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.020
Who knows? Maybe
William Shakespeare

20:55.020 --> 20:58.524
acted similarly
to Joanna Lumley.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.259
Yes.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.961
Thank you, sir.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.964
So now I'm thinking
why not make Shakespeare

21:04.964 --> 21:07.466
a little bit more
of a party animal, you know?

21:07.466 --> 21:09.068
The feedback I've been
getting from the judges

21:09.068 --> 21:12.271
is just to, like, amp up more
craziness in what I'm doing.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.472
Yeah.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.240
And I'm hoping
this might make my voice

21:15.240 --> 21:17.910
a bit louder for Michelle,
you know, with the--

21:17.910 --> 21:21.213
She might be able to hear me
from the cheap seats maybe.

21:21.213 --> 21:24.149
Yes! Well, I want you to turn
Shakespeare sugar walls out.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.417
Okay.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.286
Because a lot of people
freeze up, you know?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.854
And I don't want you
to freeze up.

21:28.854 --> 21:30.255
-Thank you, Ru.
-Thank you.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.758
I love to have instructions
and choreography.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.159
Snatch Game
is a perfect opportunity

21:34.159 --> 21:35.661
for me to think on my feet,

21:35.661 --> 21:37.262
do something that
is not comfortable for me,

21:37.262 --> 21:38.931
and have some medicine.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.699
That doesn't make any sense.
Let me do that again.

21:40.699 --> 21:43.502
I think Snatch Game
is the perfect medicine

21:43.502 --> 21:46.572
for me to just think on my feet,

21:46.572 --> 21:48.207
live in the comfortable--

21:48.207 --> 21:50.242
live in
an uncomfortable area.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.644
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
I'm fucked up.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.879
I had it. Let me
just do a different--

21:53.879 --> 21:55.514
Yeah. [laughs]

21:55.514 --> 21:57.983
All right, listen up, queens.
In a few minutes,

21:57.983 --> 22:01.220
we're gonna head on over
to the Snatch Game set.

22:01.220 --> 22:05.557
And tomorrow on the runway,
category is Holy Couture.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.793
[cheering]

22:07.793 --> 22:10.195
Whoo, spiritual realness, honey.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.231
Yes, let the church know!

22:12.231 --> 22:14.900
-Okay?
-[laughs]

22:14.900 --> 22:18.604
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.806
-Let's do it.
-Okay, I'm doing Lil Jon.

22:20.806 --> 22:25.411
Maybe I can save Abby Lee
for All Stars.

22:25.411 --> 22:28.080
Yeah, because you're definitely
gonna have to come back.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.650
[all laugh]
Aah!

22:35.854 --> 22:37.856
Michelle:
Live from Hollywood,

22:37.856 --> 22:39.625
it's the Snatch Game!

22:39.625 --> 22:42.428
Here's your host, RuPaul.

22:42.428 --> 22:46.832
Hello, hello, hello,
and welcome, everybody!

22:46.832 --> 22:50.335
Now, tonight's contestants

22:50.335 --> 22:54.440
are birds of a feather
that snatch together.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.775
First up, it's Raven.

22:56.775 --> 23:02.481
Now, Raven, what is your secret
to looking so fabulous?

23:02.481 --> 23:04.750
Six hours
and a lot of duct tape.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.985
[all laugh]

23:06.985 --> 23:10.355
And the wonderful
Dove Cameron is here.

23:10.355 --> 23:13.225
Now, what's your secret
to looking so gorgeous?

23:13.225 --> 23:16.495
Well, you know, I take about
half the time as Raven,

23:16.495 --> 23:18.163
but about twice the duct tape.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.165
[all laugh]

23:20.165 --> 23:24.002
Contestants, are you ready
to meet our stars?

23:24.002 --> 23:25.637
-Yes!
-Yes!

23:25.637 --> 23:28.173
It's the Bard himself.

23:28.173 --> 23:32.077
Say hello
to William Shakespeare.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.814
Good morrow, Sir Lady RuPaul.
How art thou today?

23:35.814 --> 23:37.950
Uh, thou is feelin' fine.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.519
Now, to be or not to be.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.221
Is that really the question?

23:42.221 --> 23:44.757
I hope so, darling, because I've
got an answer for you, darling,

23:44.757 --> 23:46.558
and it's hanging low, yes.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.660
[all laugh]

23:48.660 --> 23:52.998
Oh, my goodness, naughty boy.

23:52.998 --> 23:57.603
She's the disgraced
former secretary of education.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.539
Betsy DeVos, hello!

24:00.539 --> 24:02.474
Hello there, Senator Booker.

24:02.474 --> 24:03.942
Well, you know, that's funny
you should say that,

24:03.942 --> 24:07.079
because actually,
Cory Booker is my cousin.

24:07.079 --> 24:11.183
Now, Betsy, do you think
reading is fundamental?

24:11.183 --> 24:15.254
Oh, reading is important,
and, uh,

24:15.254 --> 24:16.655
uh, school choice.

24:16.655 --> 24:19.591
You know, you need
to be able

24:19.591 --> 24:21.927
to pick whatever school
you want to go to.

24:21.927 --> 24:25.063
See, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm a high school dropout.

24:25.063 --> 24:26.265
-Good for you!
-Thank you!

24:26.265 --> 24:29.234
Thank you for that!

24:29.234 --> 24:34.106
All right, one of
the original Drag Race girls.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.441
Hello, Tammie Brown!

24:36.441 --> 24:39.278
Ooh, Mama Ru...
[speaking gibberish]

24:41.680 --> 24:43.348
[all laugh]

24:43.348 --> 24:47.119
Now, Tammie Brown, how's it feel
to be back here at Drag Race?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.921
Oh, it feels wonderful.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.789
I almost won this thing,
you know.

24:50.789 --> 24:52.958
Actually, you didn't.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.861
Oh, well, I'll still
spinned your head

24:55.861 --> 24:57.663
around and around and around.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.032
[laughs]

25:00.032 --> 25:01.533
Okay.

25:01.533 --> 25:05.704
She put the "broad"
in Broad City.

25:05.704 --> 25:09.107
The hilarious Ilana Glazer
is here. Hi, Ilana.

25:09.107 --> 25:10.709
Hi, Ru.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.946
I'm not sure if I wanna be you
or I wanna be inside you.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.914
[laughs]
Well, you can be both.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.783
Yes, queen, yes, queen,
yes, queen.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.718
Now, you are from Brooklyn.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.887
What's your favorite thing
about Brooklyn?

25:21.887 --> 25:25.023
Well, Ru, I'm a basic
NYC bitch,

25:25.023 --> 25:28.493
so I love the weed
and I love the ass.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.462
Ooh, a girl after my own heart.

25:30.462 --> 25:33.298
Sounds like Tuesday evening.
And Wednesday.

25:33.298 --> 25:35.467
[all laugh]

25:35.467 --> 25:37.970
Okay, in the front row
we have a movie star

25:37.970 --> 25:40.973
with her own talk show.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.208
Drew Barrymore is here.
Hi, Drew.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.411
RuPaul, I am so excited
to meet you

25:46.411 --> 25:48.280
from one show host to another.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.316
You look amazing
in this snazzy little suit.

25:51.316 --> 25:53.986
Why, thank you, Drew.
That is lovely.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.888
I guess you forgot
that we worked together

25:55.888 --> 25:59.391
for a whole summer
on another show.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.961
But that's okay.

26:02.961 --> 26:06.031
I mean, you probably meet
a lot of people, don't you?

26:06.031 --> 26:08.367
I meet everyone, but
I'm so excited to be here,

26:08.367 --> 26:12.070
I woke up at 6:60,
which is also known as 7:00,

26:12.070 --> 26:16.341
and I did a sun salutation to
my statue of Steven Spielberg.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.743
So I'm ready.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.478
Now, I've always wanted
to ask you this.

26:19.478 --> 26:22.481
Would you ever do
a sequel to E.T.?

26:22.481 --> 26:24.850
I would, but I think
it would be R-rated.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.051
What would it be called?

26:26.051 --> 26:29.288
E.T., Phone My Home.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.956
Okay.

26:30.956 --> 26:36.895
East Side Boyz in the house.
It's Lil Jon, y'all.

26:36.895 --> 26:38.096
Yay-ya!

26:38.096 --> 26:39.998
[all laugh]

26:39.998 --> 26:42.234
Okay!

26:42.234 --> 26:45.470
Crunk juice in the house,
motherfucker!

26:45.470 --> 26:48.073
[all laugh]

26:48.073 --> 26:49.942
What does crunk juice
taste like?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.310
Can you describe it for me?

26:51.310 --> 26:53.412
It taste like
my ho's right here.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.546
Oh!

26:54.546 --> 26:55.914
Yay-ya!

26:55.914 --> 26:57.149
[all laugh]

26:57.149 --> 27:01.019
Up next, Oscar winner
Gwyneth Paltrow.

27:01.019 --> 27:03.822
-Hi, Gwyneth.
-Hi, Ru.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.190
Where do you keep your Oscar?

27:05.190 --> 27:08.093
I like to keep my Oscar
in my bathroom,

27:08.093 --> 27:10.529
but I'm kind of
taking a break from acting

27:10.529 --> 27:15.133
and I'm focusing more
on my business, Droop.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.568
What do you call it?

27:16.568 --> 27:19.404
Droop. It is what we can say
on television

27:19.404 --> 27:24.176
without getting sued for
mentioning my actual company.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.045
Now, I hear you have
another candle coming out.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.415
Oh, my God, are you a fan
of my yonic light bearers?

27:30.415 --> 27:33.185
Yes. What does this one
smell like?

27:33.185 --> 27:35.420
[sniffs] Yonic.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.624
I like my candles
to smell like weed and ass.

27:39.624 --> 27:41.693
[all laugh]

27:41.693 --> 27:46.798
Let's move on down to
a true legend in rock and roll.

27:46.798 --> 27:51.503
Black Sabbath front man
Ozzy Osbourne is here. Hi, Ozzy.

27:51.503 --> 27:55.073
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, oi, oi, oi!

27:55.073 --> 27:56.274
Yeah!

27:56.274 --> 27:58.210
Now, Ozzy, I gotta ask.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.946
Have you eaten
any pigeons lately?

28:00.946 --> 28:05.050
When I ate that dove,
I asked it how's its head.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.519
Do you know
what it said to me?

28:07.519 --> 28:08.820
What did it say?

28:08.820 --> 28:11.656
Nothing. It was fucking dead.

28:11.656 --> 28:13.558
[all laugh]

28:13.558 --> 28:17.095
No, you can't get good head
from a dead dove, can you?

28:17.095 --> 28:18.163
That's what they say.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.332
Oh. Oh, Dove,
no offense, Dove.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.967
I am still here.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.735
[all laugh]

28:23.735 --> 28:27.572
All right, who is ready
to play the game?

28:27.572 --> 28:29.508
-Yay-ya!
-Okay.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.343
Now we are cookin', bitch.

28:31.343 --> 28:35.313
It is time to play
the Snatch Game, honey.

28:35.313 --> 28:36.148
Ooh!

28:37.983 --> 28:40.752
Michelle: Welcome back
to the Snatch Game.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.688
Now, here's how
the Snatch Game works.

28:43.688 --> 28:46.992
I ask a question,
and you give an answer

28:46.992 --> 28:50.729
that you think will match
our celebrities.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.931
Okay, here we go.

28:52.931 --> 28:57.502
Raven, Prince Harry has become
true Hollywood royalty.

28:57.502 --> 29:00.906
Even his blank has a red carpet.

29:00.906 --> 29:04.142
Celebrities are hard at work
to write their answers.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.645
All right,
what say you, Raven?

29:06.645 --> 29:09.247
Well, I'd like to say crotch.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.316
Yeah, because
it's Prince Harry, right?

29:11.316 --> 29:14.953
Yeah, but that
would be un-Southern.

29:14.953 --> 29:16.588
[all laugh]

29:16.588 --> 29:18.957
So I'm gonna go with toilet.

29:18.957 --> 29:21.927
So even his toilet
has a red carpet.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.162
That's a very classy answer.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.130
All right, let's go
to our celebrities

29:25.130 --> 29:26.431
and hear what they have to say,

29:26.431 --> 29:29.801
starting with Tammie Brown,
who is what? In town.

29:29.801 --> 29:33.271
I said his ol' nutbush.
Ooh, yeah.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.339
His nutbush.

29:34.339 --> 29:36.875
-Oh, you know who that is, Ru?
-Yeah.

29:36.875 --> 29:41.213
It's Tinta Turnter.
Ooh, yeah.

29:41.213 --> 29:45.183
I know that Tina Turner's a big
influence on you, isn't she?

29:45.183 --> 29:49.354
Ooh, yeah, and am I big
influence on her, oh, yeah.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.123
I have no idea what you said,

29:51.123 --> 29:52.791
but that's not a match,
unfortunately.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.061
Let's go on down
to Drew Barrymore.

29:56.061 --> 29:59.397
Now, have you had
Prince Harry on your show?

29:59.397 --> 30:01.366
I've not had him on my show yet.

30:01.366 --> 30:02.701
Yeah, not yet, but is he--

30:02.701 --> 30:04.136
Not yet, but he will be,
I promise you that.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.604
Okay. All right.

30:05.604 --> 30:08.406
Now, we are looking
for toilet, Drew.

30:08.406 --> 30:09.574
What say you?

30:09.574 --> 30:13.311
I said his vegan sausage
with smashed avocado.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.980
-Okay.
-I love avocados.

30:14.980 --> 30:19.017
When I die, I wanna be buried
under an avocado tree.

30:19.017 --> 30:21.086
That way, people
can have me on their toast.

30:21.086 --> 30:24.089
All right. Well,
we are looking for toilet.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.090
That is not a toilet.

30:25.090 --> 30:28.360
Moving on down,
Bill Shakespeare.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.662
Prince Harry,
another Englishman,

30:30.662 --> 30:33.698
even his blank has a red carpet.

30:33.698 --> 30:37.035
Well, I said mischievous
as a midnight Puck.

30:37.035 --> 30:41.339
Prince Harry
loves a good fairytales.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.908
[all laugh]

30:42.908 --> 30:45.510
Miss Lady Camden, she is--

30:45.510 --> 30:48.213
Beethoven, right?

30:49.548 --> 30:50.949
[laughs]

30:50.949 --> 30:53.852
See, that's how you know
I dropped out.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.123
Betsy De-Vose. Am I saying
that right, Betsy?

30:58.123 --> 30:59.124
"DeVas."

30:59.124 --> 31:00.659
-"DeVas."
-"DeVas."

31:00.659 --> 31:01.793
What say you?

31:01.793 --> 31:04.362
Well, I said his Bible.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.231
His Bible has a red--

31:06.231 --> 31:07.933
Yes, deserves a red carpet.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.501
Do you read the Bible regularly?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.836
Oh, every day,
because God's word

31:11.836 --> 31:14.239
deserves a red carpet.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.241
Okay. All right.

31:16.241 --> 31:18.310
All right, let's move down
to Lil Jon.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.678
Hi, yep.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.112
[all laugh]

31:21.112 --> 31:22.147
Ehh.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.982
[all laugh]

31:23.982 --> 31:26.751
-What say you?
-I said his grille.

31:26.751 --> 31:28.019
Oh! Oh!

31:28.019 --> 31:30.722
Goddamn it, I need a refund
on these motherfuckers.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.057
[all laugh]

31:32.057 --> 31:34.226
I said his grille!

31:34.226 --> 31:36.394
Even his grille
has a red carpet?

31:36.394 --> 31:39.931
Sorry, Raven,
we are looking for toilet.

31:39.931 --> 31:42.367
All right, Dove, are you ready
to play the game?

31:42.367 --> 31:44.269
-I'm so ready.
-Here we go.

31:44.269 --> 31:47.706
Bianca Del Rio loves
living in Palm Springs.

31:47.706 --> 31:51.610
It's hot and dry
and filled with old men,

31:51.610 --> 31:53.278
just like her blank.

31:53.278 --> 31:56.915
Celebrities, you get to work
on writing your answer.

31:56.915 --> 31:57.916
Dove, what say you?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.718
Sold-out concerts.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.152
Ooh, nice answer.

32:01.152 --> 32:02.921
Yes, I'm a fan.
We love her.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.490
All right, let's see
if you got any matches.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.659
Fingers crossed, Dove.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.762
Let's go to Gwyneth Paltrow.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.065
We are looking
for sold-out concerts.

32:14.065 --> 32:15.433
What say you, Gwyneth?

32:15.433 --> 32:18.870
We went with meet-and-greet
lines, which is adjacent.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.606
-It's adjacent.
-Adjacent.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.141
[bell dings]
We got a match! It's a match!

32:23.141 --> 32:24.509
We got a match!

32:24.509 --> 32:26.044
Well, it is hot and dry,

32:26.044 --> 32:28.480
and we do have something
in the works at Droop

32:28.480 --> 32:30.448
to help with hot and dry.

32:30.448 --> 32:34.919
We are bringing you
the brand-new cum-bucha.

32:34.919 --> 32:38.089
This is very fertilized.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.925
Oh.

32:40.925 --> 32:43.061
Some of Bosco's jokes,
I'm thinking,

32:43.061 --> 32:44.729
I think I should get that.

32:44.729 --> 32:45.797
I don't get that.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.399
Should I get that?

32:47.399 --> 32:48.566
Oh, yeah.

32:48.566 --> 32:51.036
Your cup spilleth over.

32:51.036 --> 32:54.773
Ozzy, let me repeat
the question, okay?

32:54.773 --> 32:56.841
Bianca Del Rio loves
living in Palm Springs.

32:56.841 --> 33:00.879
It's hot and dry and filled
with old men, just like her...

33:00.879 --> 33:04.215
Ru, I also said meet-and-greets.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.084
You said meet-and-greets? Wow!

33:06.084 --> 33:07.719
Yeah!

33:07.719 --> 33:09.554
Wow.

33:09.554 --> 33:11.790
Let's move on down to Ilana.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.793
Do we have a match for Dove?

33:14.793 --> 33:16.094
Well, I went diving
in her coochie monster

33:16.094 --> 33:17.095
before I came here.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.397
Wait, whose coochie monster?

33:19.397 --> 33:21.099
Yes, her coochie monster.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.901
So I would have to say--

33:25.036 --> 33:27.472
Whew. Whew!

33:27.472 --> 33:30.375
Say her old-ass pussy.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.877
Her old-ass pussy.

33:32.877 --> 33:34.846
Her pudenda is awful, Ru.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.181
Oh, okay.

33:36.181 --> 33:39.150
It's quiet on set.

33:39.150 --> 33:42.454
Most of our jokes
aren't really landing.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.824
It's like the joke
isn't coming together fully.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.392
It's a funny setup,

33:47.392 --> 33:51.096
and then the punchline
is just kind of meh.

33:51.096 --> 33:54.332
Okay, let's move on down
to Lil Jon.

33:54.332 --> 33:55.433
Hey!

33:55.433 --> 33:59.170
We're looking
for sold-out concerts.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.772
Now, you sell out concerts,
don't you?

34:00.772 --> 34:04.142
All the time, Ru,
especially in the ATL.

34:04.142 --> 34:07.145
We got our pimp cups
in the ATL.

34:07.145 --> 34:10.215
Because remember,
crunk ain't dead.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.950
No.
[all laugh]

34:11.950 --> 34:14.052
Yay-ya!

34:14.052 --> 34:17.889
Miss DeJa's dunking it
out of the motherfucking park.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.691
♪ You do the A-town stomp ♪

34:19.691 --> 34:20.792
Uh-huh, yeah!

34:20.792 --> 34:22.727
♪ Walk away, huh,
walk away, huh ♪

34:22.727 --> 34:24.362
The rest of us
are guest-starring

34:24.362 --> 34:26.197
in the Lil Jon show.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.666
Yay-ya!
Imma sit back down.

34:28.666 --> 34:31.102
Marvelous!

34:31.102 --> 34:32.904
Now, Dove, can you do Lil Jon?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.506
Yay-ya!

34:34.506 --> 34:35.673
[all laugh]

34:35.673 --> 34:36.941
All right, here we go.

34:36.941 --> 34:40.912
Raven, Carson Kressley
is a bit of a germophobe.

34:40.912 --> 34:44.449
He won't shake your hand,
but he will shake your...

34:47.419 --> 34:49.154
He will shake your groove thing.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.456
Ow. Yeah.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.324
-Yay-ya!
-[laughs]

34:53.324 --> 34:55.994
Let's go to the celebrities
and hear what they have to say,

34:55.994 --> 34:58.730
starting with Betsy DeVos.
Betsy?

34:58.730 --> 35:02.066
My team did not prep me
for this specific question.

35:02.066 --> 35:05.236
You know, they usually
prep me for hearings.

35:05.236 --> 35:08.807
So my answer is I will follow up
with an answer in the next week.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.175
Oh.

35:11.843 --> 35:15.513
Let's go to the Bard,
William Shakespeare.

35:15.513 --> 35:17.048
Carson Kressley
is a bit of a germophobe.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.350
He won't shake your hand,
but he will shake your...

35:19.350 --> 35:21.853
He will certainly
shake your globe.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.221
Hopefully
both of them, darling.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.957
I love a pendulous globe
or two.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.259
Globe is not
the correct answer.

35:28.259 --> 35:31.329
Let's move on down
to Gwyneth Paltrow.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.965
He won't shake your hand,
but he will shake your what?

35:33.965 --> 35:35.800
I've heard some rumors
about Carson,

35:35.800 --> 35:38.203
and I've heard
that he shakes children.

35:38.203 --> 35:41.706
Oh! Shakes your children.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.741
Gwen and I
must have very seminal--

35:43.741 --> 35:47.245
similar parenting techniques,

35:47.245 --> 35:50.148
because I also said children.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.749
[sighs]

35:51.749 --> 35:54.385
I guess Miss Daya
is looking over my shoulder

35:54.385 --> 35:55.954
while I'm writing the answers
to the questions.

35:55.954 --> 35:59.157
Have you been copying
all of her answers?

35:59.157 --> 36:03.328
Well, I can't fucking read,
so, no, Ru, I haven't.

36:03.328 --> 36:08.366
Based on how it's going for me,
that's a choice.

36:08.366 --> 36:11.202
Now, I don't think he will
shake your children,

36:11.202 --> 36:13.538
but he might walk them
in nature.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.573
-Am I right, Tammie Brown?
-Ooh, yeah.

36:15.573 --> 36:19.410
Because I saw him walking
her children in nature.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.980
[laughs]
What is that accent?

36:23.648 --> 36:26.284
Thank you, Wanda Sykes.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.586
I don't know what's going on,

36:28.586 --> 36:31.356
but all the girls
are struggling right now.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.191
I smoked with that bish
the other day.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.060
-Uh-huh?
-So I have to say joint.

36:36.060 --> 36:37.662
Okay.

36:37.662 --> 36:41.165
I feel like I'm doing great,
but I haven't laughed once,

36:41.165 --> 36:45.503
and this is weird, because this
is such a strong group of girls.

36:45.503 --> 36:47.772
I said he'll shake your maracas.

36:47.772 --> 36:49.541
Shake your maracas.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.075
It's so important to be worldly

36:51.075 --> 36:53.878
and environmentally
"conscience."

36:53.878 --> 36:56.948
There are very few jokes
coming out.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.217
Like--like--like,
there's no funny.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.753
Well, that's our show.

37:01.753 --> 37:06.524
That means the winner
of Snatch Game is...

37:06.524 --> 37:08.459
Dove Cameron!

37:08.459 --> 37:10.261
Yes, darling,
you are the winner

37:10.261 --> 37:12.463
because you get to go home
after this.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.332
All right, everybody,

37:14.332 --> 37:17.835
until next time,
keep snatching for the stars.

37:17.835 --> 37:20.004
[laughs]

37:20.004 --> 37:21.506
By-ee!

37:25.610 --> 37:28.546
-Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dow!
-Blblblbl.

37:28.546 --> 37:31.849
Dios mio,
I don't even praise Jesus,

37:31.849 --> 37:33.685
but right now
I am thanking someone

37:33.685 --> 37:36.454
for getting me through
Snatch Game.

37:36.454 --> 37:39.157
I'm feeling
completely relieved.

37:39.157 --> 37:44.329
This is the one challenge
that I was terrified of.

37:44.329 --> 37:48.232
And the fact that
I did so well at it,

37:48.232 --> 37:50.668
mind-fucking-boggling.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.770
I'm definitely gonna be
one of the bottoms this week.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.305
-You think?
-Yeah, most definitely.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.074
Because
I was one of the weaker ones.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.542
After we were done with it,

37:57.542 --> 37:59.844
I was like, fuck,
like, I was bitter boots.

37:59.844 --> 38:03.047
Not at anybody else,
but just, like, at myself.

38:03.047 --> 38:05.383
Honestly, I'm embarrassed.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.685
Bitch, Snatch Game
was a raft of boos.

38:07.685 --> 38:11.656
I don't feel like it was
my shining moment by any means.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.725
Snatch Game is
a really important challenge

38:13.725 --> 38:16.427
that, like, the fans
remember forever,

38:16.427 --> 38:18.096
and I really wanted to deliver.

38:18.096 --> 38:21.032
And not delivering sucks.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.768
You said that you could see
yourself land in the bottom two.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.036
Oh, yes.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.404
Who are you kind of thinking
might also be there?

38:26.404 --> 38:28.172
Um, I definitely think Willow.

38:28.172 --> 38:29.941
I think she was gonna go in
and, like fuck it up,

38:29.941 --> 38:31.576
basically, you know, like,

38:31.576 --> 38:33.077
because she has been doing
so well, and, like--

38:33.077 --> 38:34.812
She's been in the top, like,
pretty much every challenge.

38:34.812 --> 38:37.348
I guess, but she kind of,
like, faded into the back.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.617
And I definitely think
Jasmine, too,

38:39.617 --> 38:42.120
-is probably gonna be with me.
-Probably there already.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.388
Well, don't get that
in your head,

38:43.388 --> 38:45.323
because you don't know that
for sure, you know?

38:45.323 --> 38:46.991
I'm just, like, going, like,

38:46.991 --> 38:48.626
everybody
better know their words.

38:50.595 --> 38:53.131
Willow, how you feeling?

38:53.131 --> 38:54.298
Disappointed.

38:54.298 --> 38:57.035
The pressure just felt
so on for this one,

38:57.035 --> 39:00.838
because people know
that I'm comedic, I guess.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.373
No, but you are.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.876
Snatch Game is everyone's
favorite thing in the world,

39:04.876 --> 39:06.344
and I didn't
wanna disappoint.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.146
Definitely understand that.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.281
Snatch Game is so much harder

39:10.281 --> 39:12.150
than you think
it's ever gonna be.

39:12.150 --> 39:15.887
Your brain is just, like, uh...
like, something funny now.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.822
And then as the words
come outta your mouth,

39:17.822 --> 39:20.091
you're just, like,
oh, fuck me.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.693
The silver lining is that

39:21.693 --> 39:23.528
I'm trying to be really excited
about this runway,

39:23.528 --> 39:27.231
because it's one that's, like,
really fun and important to me.

39:27.231 --> 39:30.601
For my Holy Couture look,
I am fungus.

39:30.601 --> 39:32.570
I worship mushrooms

39:32.570 --> 39:36.674
because I think they're just the
coolest organism on the planet.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.177
I don't know, I went through
this phase when I was, like, 21

39:39.177 --> 39:43.147
where I was just
absolutely terrified to die.

39:43.147 --> 39:45.049
And thankfully, over the years

39:45.049 --> 39:47.518
I've been able to, like,
come to terms with it.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.854
But, like, the thing
that helped me the most

39:49.854 --> 39:52.356
in dealing with death
is psychedelic mushrooms.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.859
-Going through that experience.
-The shrooms, honey.

39:54.859 --> 39:56.861
So that means that this runway

39:56.861 --> 39:58.896
does really, like,
mean something.

39:58.896 --> 40:02.133
Yeah. I mean, I love mushrooms
beyond just the fun stuff.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.603
Fungus is so interesting,
because it's the cycle of life.

40:05.603 --> 40:08.573
Fungus breaks everything down
once it's ready to die,

40:08.573 --> 40:10.007
and then makes it
into something new.

40:10.007 --> 40:14.212
I think Willow is such
an amazing, unique person.

40:14.212 --> 40:18.149
Hey, if you worship mushrooms,
girl, more power to you.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.618
I think we kind of look at
fungus like it's really nasty.

40:20.618 --> 40:23.788
-Right.
-It's kind of gross and weird.

40:23.788 --> 40:26.958
But so is my drag.
[chuckles]

40:26.958 --> 40:29.093
I know the judges
like my style,

40:29.093 --> 40:33.998
and I'm hoping my look
is my Snatch Game redemption.

40:33.998 --> 40:36.000
I think this is going to be

40:36.000 --> 40:39.070
Jasmine versus Jorgeous
part two, the reckoning.

40:39.070 --> 40:42.173
And, you know, I wouldn't
be opposed to seeing that.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.841
[laughs]

40:43.841 --> 40:46.611
I just don't wanna be
featured in it.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.346
I feel so pretty.

40:48.346 --> 40:50.214
Oh. No, I do feel pretty.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.682
Like, I genuinely feel pretty.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.684

dressed as Joan of Arc.

42:39.490 --> 42:42.426
Well, Joan Jett of Arc,
let's say that.

42:42.426 --> 42:43.895
I'm not religious or anything,

42:43.895 --> 42:48.366

44:14.352 --> 44:16.387
This look
is specifically inspired

44:16.387 --> 44:18.222
by bleeding tooth fungus,

44:18.222 --> 44:22.793
a fuzzy white fungus
that oozes out red blood.

I've had on the runway,

of growing up Catholic

46:49.740 --> 46:51.475
but no longer being Catholic,

46:51.475 --> 46:55.045
and Bosco is a very
demonic character.

47:35.286 --> 47:38.355
So I'm not here to shame,
I'm here to investigate

47:38.355 --> 47:40.624
and find out what had happened.

47:40.624 --> 47:44.395
All right, DeJa Skye.

47:44.395 --> 47:45.763
-Yay-ya!
-Yay-ya!

47:45.763 --> 47:47.498
DeJa, you went with Lil Jon,

47:47.498 --> 47:51.468
which was actually the one
that was really funny.

47:51.468 --> 47:53.103
You went for it.

47:53.103 --> 47:55.105
Yay-ya!
Imma sit back down.

47:55.105 --> 47:56.340
You had answers for everything,

47:56.340 --> 47:58.509
but you didn't
take it too seriously,

47:58.509 --> 48:01.779
and that's why I thought
it was actually the good one.

48:01.779 --> 48:03.881
He's a big personality.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.015
Hi, yep.

48:05.015 --> 48:06.283
And that's a smart choice.

48:06.283 --> 48:08.319
You wanna be big, you wanna pop,
you wanna stand out,

48:08.319 --> 48:10.454
and I think that's what
Michelle was alluding to.

48:10.454 --> 48:12.489
A lot of people
kind of receded.

48:12.489 --> 48:15.326
Tonight, when I heard what
the category was going to be,

48:15.326 --> 48:18.362
one of my first thoughts
was Sunday at the Met Gala.

48:18.362 --> 48:20.064
I think you did
a wonderful job.

48:20.064 --> 48:21.832
You're shining.
You're such a star.

48:21.832 --> 48:22.967
Thank you.

48:22.967 --> 48:24.568
Up next, Jasmine Kennedie.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.903
Hi, y'all.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.304
The investigation continues.

48:27.304 --> 48:29.039
-[laughs]
-All right, Jazzie.

48:29.039 --> 48:32.276
Betsy DeVos was actually
a really funny choice.

48:32.276 --> 48:33.277
On paper.

48:33.277 --> 48:36.080
I think you literally thought

48:36.080 --> 48:37.982
that you had to, like,
know things about education.

48:37.982 --> 48:39.149
Yeah.

48:39.149 --> 48:40.651
You took Betsy DeVos' job

48:40.651 --> 48:42.419
more seriously
than Betsy DeVos did.

48:42.419 --> 48:45.456
[all laugh]

48:45.456 --> 48:49.493
As Trinity the Tuck said,
"Where are the jokes?"

48:49.493 --> 48:53.831
But honestly, I thought I
delivered jokes that were good.

48:53.831 --> 48:56.166
But you didn't get
any laughs, hon.

48:56.166 --> 48:57.434
I know.
In my head, I was laughing.

48:57.434 --> 49:00.204
I think that your look tonight
is beautiful,

49:00.204 --> 49:02.673
and I do love this
Gemini thing in the set.

49:02.673 --> 49:04.041
You have all the tattoos, right?

49:04.041 --> 49:05.242
Yeah, they're my mom
and my sister.

49:05.242 --> 49:06.343
They're beautiful.
I can tell that astrology

49:06.343 --> 49:07.344
really means a lot to you.

49:07.344 --> 49:09.480
-Thank you.
-All right, up next,

49:09.480 --> 49:12.650
from the Jubilation
Congregation, it's Angeria.

49:12.650 --> 49:18.255
I am living for the June
Pointerism of this look, hunty.

49:18.255 --> 49:22.059
The fit is perfection,
the accessories are gorgeous.

49:22.059 --> 49:23.694
It's a revelation.

49:23.694 --> 49:25.129
The investigation continues.

49:25.129 --> 49:26.664
Oh, Lord.

49:26.664 --> 49:28.032
Oh, this a eight-part
investigation?

49:28.032 --> 49:30.501
Yes! Angeria,

49:30.501 --> 49:33.003
you chose one of the most
entertaining queens, right?

49:33.003 --> 49:35.139
-Tammie Brown.
-Ooh, yeah.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.808
She's got so much to offer,

49:37.808 --> 49:40.744
and I felt like you just
kind of kept it one-note.

49:40.744 --> 49:43.113
Was it my favorite
performance? No.

49:43.113 --> 49:46.817
But I do think that
I fell in love with you

49:46.817 --> 49:50.421
because you seemed to me like
you were having so much fun.

49:50.421 --> 49:51.689
But it still wasn't good enough,

49:51.689 --> 49:53.824
because we all know
Tammie Brown,

49:53.824 --> 49:55.826
and Tammie Brown
has all these isms.

49:55.826 --> 49:58.462
You tried to do it,
but it just didn't work.

49:58.462 --> 50:00.998
It just felt confined.
It just felt confined.

50:02.266 --> 50:06.203
Our investigation continues
with Willow Pill.

50:06.203 --> 50:08.872
Willow Pill, where were you
the night of?

50:08.872 --> 50:10.307
[all laugh]

50:10.307 --> 50:12.543
You chose Drew Barrymore.

50:12.543 --> 50:14.144
When you first started,
I got really excited

50:14.144 --> 50:17.081
because you had the lisp,
the way her mouth moves,

50:17.081 --> 50:20.351
her mannerisms,
and I believed you were her,

50:20.351 --> 50:22.019
but she was really boring.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.088
We wanted drag Drew.

50:24.088 --> 50:25.656
I just felt like energetically,

50:25.656 --> 50:27.424
I could feel your
insecurity about it,

50:27.424 --> 50:29.893
and I could feel you
looking to Ru

50:29.893 --> 50:32.229
for the approval of your jokes.

50:32.229 --> 50:34.198
This look is really fun.

50:34.198 --> 50:37.501
This is like how the Wiggles
would explain psychedelics.

50:37.501 --> 50:40.471
There's no detail on this
that I could ding.

50:40.471 --> 50:42.406
I think it is very well done.

50:42.406 --> 50:43.607
Who made this outfit?

50:43.607 --> 50:44.608
Ida Birthing made it.

50:44.608 --> 50:46.343
-Who?
-Ida Birthing.

50:46.343 --> 50:47.678
Uma Thurman.

50:47.678 --> 50:49.246
-Oh, Uma Thurman!
-Uma Thurman made this.

50:49.246 --> 50:50.714
Oh, great, I love her work.

50:50.714 --> 50:51.882
-She's very talented.
-Yeah.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.051
You should have done her
in the Snatch Game.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.319
Yeah.
[all laugh]

50:55.319 --> 50:56.320
On mushrooms.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.654
As Drew Barrymore.

50:57.654 --> 50:59.523
I think I get it now.

50:59.523 --> 51:01.859
[all laugh]

51:01.859 --> 51:04.528
Up next, we've got Daya Betty.

51:04.528 --> 51:06.330
Both the performance
and this look,

51:06.330 --> 51:08.532
they were very literal
interpretations

51:08.532 --> 51:10.467
of something that
you've kind of seen before.

51:10.467 --> 51:12.703
-Okay.
-Give us the drag twist.

51:12.703 --> 51:14.171
[imitating Ozzy Osborne]
Ozzy's, like, actually, like,

51:14.171 --> 51:16.073
Sharon, fucking close the door.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.876
[normal voice]
And then...unconscious.

51:18.876 --> 51:21.445
Like, give us that insanity.

51:21.445 --> 51:23.580
This kind of marry
the night moment,

51:23.580 --> 51:26.650
Lady Gaga is fun,
but the length of that dress

51:26.650 --> 51:27.818
is falling
at that horrible place

51:27.818 --> 51:29.253
that we often talk about here.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.054
So I would have gone
really short,

51:31.054 --> 51:32.756
because you have a gift,
and that gift is height.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.992
You should exploit that.

51:34.992 --> 51:38.028
Up next, Jorgeous.

51:38.028 --> 51:39.062
Hello-teous!

51:39.062 --> 51:41.265
If they open a casino
in the Vatican,

51:41.265 --> 51:42.399
you're totally getting hired.

51:42.399 --> 51:43.734
-Oh, yeah.
-This is really beautiful.

51:43.734 --> 51:46.904
I love that
it's crystal encrusted.

51:46.904 --> 51:49.840
I kind of wish, like, the joint
was a little bit more fabulous.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.842
Again, hit us over the head.
Make it super campy.

51:51.842 --> 51:54.678
Tonight at 11:00
on the Pacoima News Live,

51:54.678 --> 51:59.116
there's a missing persons alert
looking for Ilana Glazer.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.184
[all laugh]

52:00.184 --> 52:02.553
Because we didn't find her.

52:02.553 --> 52:04.021
The hair was okay.

52:04.021 --> 52:05.589
The end.

52:05.589 --> 52:07.124
[all laugh]

52:07.124 --> 52:09.193
Ilana Glazer is so charismatic,

52:09.193 --> 52:11.628
and I think that
she has so much fun,

52:11.628 --> 52:12.863
and I didn't think
you were having fun.

52:12.863 --> 52:14.898
And I think that
that was the joy

52:14.898 --> 52:16.467
missing behind your eyes.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.935
I don't know. I really
get in my head a lot,

52:17.935 --> 52:20.704
and once I start doing it, I'm
like okay, this is not funny,

52:20.704 --> 52:23.173
and, like, I, like,
shut down immediately.

52:23.173 --> 52:26.210
Jorgeous, I do not want you
to get down on yourself,

52:26.210 --> 52:29.847
because I know you like
to do that, but don't do that.

52:29.847 --> 52:32.983
-Okay.
-You were all equally as bad.

52:32.983 --> 52:35.519
[all laugh]

52:35.519 --> 52:37.254
She ain't lying.

52:37.254 --> 52:42.092
Investigation continues
with Lady Camden.

52:42.092 --> 52:43.494
This look tonight
is not my favorite.

52:43.494 --> 52:46.029
I think that it doesn't stack up

52:46.029 --> 52:47.331
against the rest of the looks
on the runway.

52:47.331 --> 52:50.133
It looks a little
Halloween costumey to me.

52:50.133 --> 52:52.836
Yeah, I think that it does read
a little bit homemade.

52:52.836 --> 52:55.706
You were William Shakespeare.
You were the Bard.

52:55.706 --> 52:59.176
It was very theatrical,
very stagey,

52:59.176 --> 53:00.844
but I don't think it was
the best performance ever.

53:00.844 --> 53:02.546
Shakespeare was fun.

53:02.546 --> 53:06.884
It just--it wasn't--
it wasn't funny.

53:07.918 --> 53:10.954
Something in the milk
ain't clean.

53:10.954 --> 53:12.022
It's Bosco.

53:12.022 --> 53:14.324
You are really making a habit

53:14.324 --> 53:15.926
of impressing me on the runway.

53:15.926 --> 53:18.962
It's a little bit devilish
and villainous.

53:18.962 --> 53:21.298
This is just really elevated
and intelligent,

53:21.298 --> 53:23.400
and I didn't know
what my type quite was

53:23.400 --> 53:24.835
until you walked out
on the runway,

53:24.835 --> 53:27.070
and this is exactly my type,
hooves and all.

53:27.070 --> 53:30.841
The final chapter
of my investigation.

53:30.841 --> 53:33.744
You chose to do another one

53:33.744 --> 53:36.013
that's not known
for a personality,

53:36.013 --> 53:38.415
which is Gwyneth Paltrow,
and I say that with love.

53:38.415 --> 53:40.851
I buy into all the shit
that she sells,

53:40.851 --> 53:42.853
so I appreciated that.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.221
But she has a sort of, like,

53:44.221 --> 53:46.823
a relaxed kind of joy
behind the eyes

53:46.823 --> 53:48.625
that makes you love her.

53:48.625 --> 53:51.061
I think that you were
pretty, like, dour.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.963
It just felt dragged down.

53:52.963 --> 53:55.265
Thing is, you are funny.
We saw it last week.

53:55.265 --> 53:58.101
So I think sometimes
you just got in your own way.

53:58.101 --> 54:02.239
I think I tried to
out-think doing a character,

54:02.239 --> 54:05.475
and I see that didn't work.

54:05.475 --> 54:08.579
This concludes
our investigation.

54:10.113 --> 54:12.382
You know when your mom says,

54:12.382 --> 54:15.185
like, "I'm not angry,
I'm disappointed?"

54:15.185 --> 54:18.322
That's what this feels like,
and I think everyone right now

54:18.322 --> 54:21.091
is just trying not to go cry
in the bathroom.

54:22.693 --> 54:24.761
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

54:24.761 --> 54:26.430
this episode is called

54:26.430 --> 54:28.231
Who Killed Snatch Game?

54:28.231 --> 54:29.366
[all laugh]

54:29.366 --> 54:32.002
Starting with DeJa Skye.

54:32.002 --> 54:34.004
DeJa was the best thing
about it.

54:34.004 --> 54:36.640
Her performance
was so ridiculous,

54:36.640 --> 54:39.009
it absolutely won me over.

54:39.009 --> 54:40.210
Jasmine Kennedie.

54:40.210 --> 54:41.812
Jasmine as Betsy DeVos.

54:41.812 --> 54:44.982
Great idea, a lot of fodder
there for comedy.

54:44.982 --> 54:46.516
Didn't really happen.

54:46.516 --> 54:49.987
I think she always appears
very nervous about everything,

54:49.987 --> 54:51.355
and I think
that got her in trouble.

54:51.355 --> 54:52.756
And it just wasn't funny,

54:52.756 --> 54:53.924
and at the end of the day,

54:53.924 --> 54:54.992
that's what Snatch Game
is all about.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.226
There were no laughs.

54:56.226 --> 54:57.394
Angeria.

54:57.394 --> 54:59.463
You know like when
your car is not starting

54:59.463 --> 55:00.664
and you keep starting it

55:00.664 --> 55:01.565
and trying to turn it over
and turn it over?

55:01.565 --> 55:03.133
-Yes.
-That's what I feel like

55:03.133 --> 55:05.235
with Angeria tonight
as Tammie Brown.

55:05.235 --> 55:07.504
Come on, I'm turning the key,
she's almost there,

55:07.504 --> 55:08.605
and then it just won't turn.

55:08.605 --> 55:10.641
It won't click in,
it won't start.

55:10.641 --> 55:11.942
She was giving us physicality,

55:11.942 --> 55:13.410
but she wasn't giving us

55:13.410 --> 55:15.479
the kookiness
that is Tammie Brown.

55:15.479 --> 55:16.847
-Willow.
-In the Snatch Game,

55:16.847 --> 55:19.516
she just didn't
take it far enough.

55:19.516 --> 55:20.884
Absolutely, a lot of the girls

55:20.884 --> 55:22.519
are up there
dedicating themselves

55:22.519 --> 55:23.854
to the believability
of the character,

55:23.854 --> 55:25.322
but it's not actually
an acting challenge,

55:25.322 --> 55:26.790
it is a comedy challenge.

55:26.790 --> 55:28.625
Conceptually, it was
an interesting idea.

55:28.625 --> 55:31.561
It just was not funny.

55:31.561 --> 55:32.596
Daya Betty.

55:32.596 --> 55:34.831
Ozzy is such a character.

55:34.831 --> 55:37.167
She could have gone
so much further with it.

55:37.167 --> 55:40.003
This is not RuPaul's
Impersonation Race.

55:40.003 --> 55:41.972
It's RuPaul's Drag Race.

55:41.972 --> 55:44.975
We wanna see who you are
through your performance.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.343
Jorgeous.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.844
You know, I think
with the Snatch Game,

55:47.844 --> 55:50.213
you know, if you think
you can't, you're right.

55:50.213 --> 55:53.850
There was no real Ilana in it
because Ilana is so freed,

55:53.850 --> 55:55.419
and Jorgeous
is the exact opposite.

55:55.419 --> 55:56.586
You're absolutely right.

55:56.586 --> 55:58.755
There's so much focus
put on the beauty,

55:58.755 --> 56:00.691
but she hasn't
connected the dots

56:00.691 --> 56:04.461
to those other areas
of her personality

56:04.461 --> 56:06.329
that make her
even more interesting.

56:06.329 --> 56:07.931
-Mm-hmm.
-Lady Camden.

56:07.931 --> 56:09.866
She had a character
and she had a delivery

56:09.866 --> 56:11.301
and she knew
what she wanted to say.

56:11.301 --> 56:13.770
Was it the most hilarious thing
I've ever seen? No.

56:13.770 --> 56:17.507
It just needed to be
fleshed out a little bit more.

56:17.507 --> 56:18.875
The runway look,
I was not a fan of this.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.745
It was a little
off the rack for me.

56:21.745 --> 56:23.346
What rack are you shopping at?

56:23.346 --> 56:24.948
Frederick's of Spice World.

56:24.948 --> 56:26.383
-Oh, okay.
-[laughs]

56:26.383 --> 56:27.751
Last queen, Bosco.

56:27.751 --> 56:29.419
Bosco as Gwyneth Paltrow,

56:29.419 --> 56:31.688
that should be enough
to say "No."

56:31.688 --> 56:32.856
[all laugh]

56:32.856 --> 56:35.025
But I thought she looked
beautiful as Gwyneth,

56:35.025 --> 56:36.993
but the voice
was so distracting.

56:36.993 --> 56:38.495
Hi, Ru.

56:38.495 --> 56:41.331
It was so dependent
on her selling the products.

56:41.331 --> 56:42.833
You know,
one time, two times,

56:42.833 --> 56:45.836
it's too much,
and the joke isn't there.

56:45.836 --> 56:47.704
You know, these queens
are so much better

56:47.704 --> 56:50.207
than the performances
that they gave.

56:50.207 --> 56:52.242
That's the real tragedy of this.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.744
We've seen what they can do.

56:53.744 --> 56:55.312
We know
they're better than that.

56:55.312 --> 56:57.914
That's why this Snatch Game
was so shocking.

56:57.914 --> 57:01.585
Silence!
I've made my decision.

57:01.585 --> 57:02.886
Bring back my girls.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.255
Welcome back, ladies.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.390
Based on your
Snatch Game performances

57:07.390 --> 57:12.295
and your Holy Couture
runway presentations,

57:12.295 --> 57:14.131
I've made some decisions.

57:18.068 --> 57:20.470
DeJa Skye.

57:20.470 --> 57:24.674
As Lil Jon,
you took a big swing,

57:24.674 --> 57:27.177
and you scored.

57:27.177 --> 57:30.447
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.715
[cheers and applause]

57:31.715 --> 57:33.283
Oh, my God.

57:33.283 --> 57:35.485
You've won a cash prize
of $5.000.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.388
I am no longer Susan Lucci.

57:38.388 --> 57:40.023
She can have that title back.

57:40.023 --> 57:42.359
I got my own title.
A winner, baby.

57:42.359 --> 57:44.461
You may step
to the back of the stage.

57:44.461 --> 57:45.662
Thank you so much.

57:45.662 --> 57:47.831
I am so happy for DeJa.

57:47.831 --> 57:50.200
I know she's been
riding up there in the top

57:50.200 --> 57:52.469
for the past couple of weeks,
and she finally got it.

57:52.469 --> 57:56.206
I know what it feels like,
so congratulations, babe.

57:59.409 --> 58:04.481
This week, the rest of you
snatched our attention,

58:04.481 --> 58:07.684
but for all the wrong reasons.

58:07.684 --> 58:09.986
I really expected
more from you.

58:10.987 --> 58:12.856
I'm sorry, my dears...

58:14.724 --> 58:18.094
But you are all
up for elimination.

58:20.030 --> 58:21.865
Shut the--

58:23.300 --> 58:25.368
What the hell?

58:27.938 --> 58:33.076
I am just as bad
as Jasmine was this week?

58:34.611 --> 58:36.379
To make my final decision,

58:36.379 --> 58:38.615
I need to see you all

58:38.615 --> 58:41.685
lip sync for your
mother-tucking lives.

58:42.786 --> 58:46.556
Um, come again?

58:46.556 --> 58:49.292
Ugh!

58:49.292 --> 58:50.961
All right, let's go.

58:50.961 --> 58:52.128
I'm not going down
without a fight.

58:53.930 --> 58:56.366
But not now.

58:58.602 --> 59:00.704
-Jasmine.
-Yes.

59:00.704 --> 59:02.505
Angeria.

59:02.505 --> 59:03.807
Willow.

59:03.807 --> 59:05.976
Daya.

59:05.976 --> 59:06.977
Jorgeous.

59:06.977 --> 59:09.512
Lady Camden.

59:09.512 --> 59:12.015
Bosco.

59:12.015 --> 59:14.251
Next week,
you are cordially invited

59:14.251 --> 59:19.522
to a Lip Sync
Lollapa-Ru-Za smackdown

59:19.522 --> 59:25.195
to determine which one of you
will sashay away.

59:29.132 --> 59:32.569
Never in Snatch Game history
has this been the outcome.

59:32.569 --> 59:35.872
This is more than
the face crack of the century.

59:35.872 --> 59:38.375
This is the whole body crack,
like, doing a back bend

59:38.375 --> 59:40.076
and, like, your invertebrae
falling out.

59:40.076 --> 59:45.415
DeJa, next week,
you are safe from elimination.

59:46.549 --> 59:48.785
I'm a really good lip syncer,

59:48.785 --> 59:52.856
but this is fucking terrifying.

59:52.856 --> 59:56.459
Ugh!

59:56.459 --> 59:59.229
Oh, yeah, honey,
this shit done got heavy.

1:00:05.802 --> 1:00:07.470
RuPaul: Next time
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

1:00:07.470 --> 1:00:12.108
If there was ever a time
to leave it all on the runway,

1:00:12.108 --> 1:00:15.278
tonight is the night.

1:00:15.278 --> 1:00:16.579
Bring it on.

1:00:16.579 --> 1:00:17.814
Like, I'm ready to fight.

1:00:17.814 --> 1:00:19.482
These bitches
better be scared of me.

1:00:19.482 --> 1:00:21.518
This is gonna be a fight
to the finish.

1:00:21.518 --> 1:00:29.960
